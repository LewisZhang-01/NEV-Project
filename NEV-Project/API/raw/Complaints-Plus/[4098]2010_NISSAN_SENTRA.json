THE SERVICE ENGINE SOON LIGHT COMES ON, THE VDC CONTROL LIGHT COMES ON, AND ANOTHER LIGHT THAT IS ABOVE THE VDC LIGHT COMES ON. CODES P0720 AND P1778 WERE FOUND BY A LOCAL NON-NISSAN DEALER WHO CHECKED THEM AS A COURTESY FOR ME. HAVE DISCOVERED THAT NISSAN HAS EXTENDED THE CVT TRANSMISSION WARRANTY ON CERTAIN NISSANS UP TO 10 YRS OR 120,000 MILES, MY SENTRA IS INCLUDED AMONG OTHERS. GET MORE INFO AT:  HTTP://WWW.NISSANASSIST.COM/PROGRAMDETAILS.PHP. HOWEVER, MY LOCAL NISSAN DEALER SAYS IF IT WILL COST ME 4 HOURS LABOR AT $125 HR TO TEAR DOWN FOR A FULL DIAGNOSIS. IF NOT COVERED, I HAVE TO PAY THAT. A CALL TO ANOTHER NISSAN SERVICE CENTER EXPLAINED THE SAME EXPENSE. HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT THERE ARE MANY COMING THRU THAT ARE UNDER THE REPLACEMENT PROGRAM DUE TO A DEFECT THAT CAUSES ENGINE COOLANT INTO THE TRANSMISSION. FOR THAT PROBLEM, NISSAN WILL REPLACE IT BUT THEY EXPECT THE CUSTOMER TO PAY $2,000 TOWARD THE BILL. THAT IS RIDICULOUS FOR A MANUFACTURER DEFECT IN DESIGN THAT THEY HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT CAUSES THE FAILURE.

AS PER NISSAN'S-USA RECOMMENDATIONS I TOWED MY CAR FOR EXTENSIVE DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATIONS AT MARRAZI NISSAN, IN NAPLES FL ON FEBRUARY THE 21ST. NISSAN -USA DID NOT SEND ME A COPY OF THE DETAILED TECHNICAL DIAGNOSTIC REPORT THAT MY CAR WAS SUBJECTED TO FOR THE PAST 3 WEEKS.  CLEARLY THE BRAKES WERE DEPRESSED SINCE THE 5 FEET SKID MARK ON THE SIDEWALK IS VISIBLE 'CHECK THE PICTURES POSTED.  THE SHOE WAS NARROWER THAN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE BRAKE PEDAL AND THE ACCELERATION PEDAL,  SO THIS DOES NOT EXPLAIN THE SUDDEN ACCELERATION. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT IN 2005 NISSAN INTRODUCED THE OVERRIDE ACCELERATOR INPUT, MEANING DEPRESSING THE BRAKE WILL CUT OFF THE ACCELERATION.  CONCLUSION: IT WAS A MALFUNCTION AND CLEARLY A SUDDEN ACCELERATION INCIDENT.   NISSAN USA WILL NOT STATE WHETHER ACCORDING TO THEIR INVESTIGATION THE VEHICLE IS SAFE FOR DRIVING AND DOES NOT POSE A ROAD HAZARD. THE CAR IS STILL UNDER FULL WARRANTY, I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DRIVE IT FOR NEARLY A MONTH.   I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THIS CAR SINCE IN MY OPINION IT POSES A SAFETY HAZARD.
