I WAS PANICKING, I HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO, ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS WAS MY FIRST CAR. I BARELY GOT HER IN 2011 AND I'VE HAD ENDLESS PROBLEMS WITH HER. WHEN SHE RUNS GOOD, SHE RUNS GREAT BUT OHH WHEN SHE HAS PROBLEMS, SHE BRINGS YOU ABSOLUTE HELL. IT BEGAN AS A SLOW LEAK & ODDLY ENOUGH ONLY LEAKING SOMETIMES. WE TOOK MY JETTA TO A SHOP IN VALENCIA AND GOT THE HOSES AND THERMOSTAT REPLACED. WHATEVER REASON THE MECHANICS DID NOT NOTICE IT, OR NOTICED IT & WERE TRYING TO SQUEEZE MORE MONEY OUT OF ME WHILE THEY DID A TEMPORARY FIX. BARELY THIS YEAR I DISCOVERED THANKS TO MY HANDY MECHANICS SAVVY BOYFRIEND - THAT IT WAS MY WATER PUMP WHICH IS DEFECTIVE. 2 INJURIES OCCURRED TO MY BOYFRIEND THANKS TO THIS OVERHEATING PROBLEM. DRIVING ON THE FWY WE STOPPED TO PUT WATER (RELIGIOUSLY CARRYING 4 GALLONS OF WATER IN THE CAR AT ALL TIMES) IN 100* WEATHER W/ NO A/C & ME BEING SEVERELY HEAT INTOLERANT, MY BOYFRIEND TOOK OFF THE CAP TO THE RADIATOR. THAT'S WHEN BOILING HOT WATER EXPLODED ALL OVER HIM. LUCKILY I'M FIRST AID CERTIFIED AND HAD MY FIRST AID KIT HANDY & TENDED TO HIM. HE BEGAN TO BLISTER INSTANTANEOUSLY. THAT SAME INCIDENT OCCURRED AGAIN BUT WITH MY TEMP. GAUGE READING AT REGULAR TEMP. STILL EXPLODING ALL OVER HIM. I WAS LEFT TRAUMATIZED SEEING MY BOYFRIEND GET BURNT AND SO SEVERELY IN PAIN, AS WELL AS MY OWN EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS ALONE: MY CAR SHUT OFF ON ME AT A RED LIGHT, WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN THE TRAFFIC COMING FROM BEHIND ME HAD A SLOW REFLEX TO MY EMERGENCY FLASHERS: I ALMOST GOT HIT 5 TIMES: LUCKY FOR ME, MY HORN WORKS. WELL, NOW THE WATER LEAKS OUT JUST AS QUICKLY AS WE POUR IT IN. MY CAR IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD AND SHE'S ALL I HAVE. I'M JOBLESS & HOMELESS RIGHT NOW & IF I WERE TO LOSE MY CAR, I'D BE LEFT COMPLETELY HOPELESS HAVING TO START FROM SCRATCH AGAIN.   *TR",

CHEMICALS SEEPING THROUGH THE CARPETS AND THE DRIVER BREATHING IT IN EVERY TIME THEY DRIVE IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT A DRIVER SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT. A CAR IS UNSAFE ENOUGH BUT TO ADD TOXINS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I DIDN'T PAY FOR A CAR TO GET HEADACHES AND BREATH IN CHEMICALS WHEN I DRIVE IT. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM?

I CALLED VOLKSWAGEN TO FIND OUT IF I COULD BE REIMBURSED FOR THE COILS THAT I PAID TO INSTALL AND WAS TOLD THAT \"MY VEHICLE DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR THE RECALL.\"  THE PRESS RELEASE CLEARLY STATES THAT\"ALL VOLKSWAGENS  EQUIPPED WITH THE 2.8L ENGINE\" QUALIFIES.  NOW- I'M STUCK.  I NEED TO PAY FOR NEW IGNITION COILS AGAIN AND NEITHER SET QUALIFIES FOR THE RECALL.  A WEB SEARCH HAS TURNED UP MANY OTHER CONSUMERS THAT ARE DEALING WITH THIS SAME ISSUE WITH VW.  IT'S A SAFETY HAZARD FOR THOSE OF US DRIVING VW AND OTHERS ON THE ROAD WITH US.  THIS IS MY FOURTH JETTA AND MAY BE MY LAST BASED UPON MY EXPERIENCES IN GETTING THIS RESOLVED.*AK",

LV6 ENGINE AND 5-SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSION. ON 03 AUG 2006 (MILEAGE: 84028) I HAD THE BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH REPLACED AT MY OWN EXPENSE WHEN THE ECL INDICATOR CAME ON. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IN 19 MONTHS I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE SAME BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH. THE FIRST TIME WAS 10 NOVEMBER 2004 (MILEAGE: 68184) IN WHICH THE REPAIR WAS PERFORMED UNDER NHTSA RECALL #04V-09600 (20 FEBRUARY 2004). IN BOTH CASES THE REPAIRS WERE PERFORMED BY LITHIA VOLKSWAGEN OF THORNTON, COLORADO. THE FIRST SWITCH REPLACEMENT USED PART #1J0-945-511-D, WHICH WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE MOST RECENT REPLACEMENT USING PART #1J0-945-511-F. THIS IMPLIES A NEW BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH WAS DESIGNED BY VOLKSWAGEN BECAUSE OF FLAWS WITH THE DESIGN USED TO RESPOND TO THE NHTSA RECALL. MY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE SECOND INCIDENT OF THIS BRAKE SWITCH FAILURE SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY EITHER THE FEBRUARY 2004 RECALL THAT REPAIRED THE FIRST INSTANCE OR THE NEW RECALL 06V183000. SINCE THE BRAKE LIGHT IS A CRITICAL SAFETY FEATURE OF THE VEHICLE IT SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO FUNCTION LONGER THAN 19 MONTHS. ITS FAILURE PLACES MY FAMILY AND I AT RISK OF INJURY OR EVEN DEATH DUE TO A REAR END COLLISION BECAUSE OF VOLKSWAGENS INABILITY TO PROPERLY DESIGN A BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH. THIS SAFETY SYSTEM SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO OPERATE THE LIFE OF THE AUTOMOBILE TO PROTECT ITS OCCUPANTS. VOLKSWAGEN SHOULD MAKE A SERIOUS EFFORT TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM PERMANENTLY OR DEMONSTRATE THEIR COMMITMENT TO CUSTOMER SAFETY BY REPLACING THE SWITCH AT MANUFACTURER EXPENSE. WHEN I DISCUSSED THIS WITH VOLKSWAGEN CUSTOMER SERVICE (1-800-822-8987, REF. #60279193) THEY CLAIMED THIS SERVICE WAS NOT COVERED BY EITHER RECALL AND SINCE THE PART HAD PERFORMED PAST THE MANUFACTURER WARRANTY IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO REPAIR THE SWITCH AT MY OWN EXPENSE.  *NM",

WITHIN THE PRESS RELEASE IT WAS STATED THAT VW/AUDI WILL BEGIN REPLACING ALL IGNITION COILS IN CARS POTENTIALLY AFFECTED.  I ALSO FOUND A DEFECT INVESTIGATION ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE (#DP05004)  WHICH STATED THAT VW ISSUED A CSC TO INSTRUCT THEIR DEALERSHIPS TO REPLACE THE COIL PACKS IN THE VEHICLES AT NO COST, REGARDLESS OF THEIR PERFORMANCE.  AS I DID NOT RECEIVE THIS INFORMATION FROM VW I SENT A LETTER TO VW ASKING THEM TO HONOR THE CSC AND COVER THE COSTS FOR THE REPAIRS TO MY VEHICLE.  I SPOKE WITH CRAIG PETERS AND DON MORITZ, BOTH WITH VW AND THEY REFUSED TO HONOR THE CSC.  THEY INFORMED ME THAT EVEN THOUGH THE PRESS RELEASE STATES THAT \"ALL VW'S EQUIPPED WITH THE 2.8 LITER VR6\" WERE AFFECTED, IT WAS IN FACT, AN ERROR AND ONLY CERTAIN VEHICLES WERE AFFECTED.  *JB",

DEALER SERVICE ADVISOR RECOMMENDED LOOKING AT TRANSMISSION AND THEN DISCOVERED THAT THE CLUTCH HAD FAILED. IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSIS WAS THAT IT WAS DRIVER ERROR. LATER THAT DAY, AFTER EXAMINING THE PARTS THAT WERE REMOVED FROM THE CAR IT WAS REVEALED THAT THE SPRINGS OF THE CLUTCH PLATE HAD COME OUT OF THE METAL BRACKETS OF THE CLUTCH. DEALER CLAIMED THEY HAD ONLY SEEN THAT AS A RESULT OF MISUSE BUT DECIDED TO PARTIALLY WARRANTY THE PARTS AFTER DETERMINING THAT I HAD TAKEN EXCELLENT CARE OF THE CAR AND HAD EXHIBITED NO ABUSE OF THE VEHICLE.  THIS FIRST INCIDENT TOOK PLACE WHEN THE CAR HAD 23K MILES ON THE ODOMETER AND I HAD OWNED THE VEHICLE SINCE IT WAS NEW.  THE SECOND FAILURE WAS AT 73 K MILES IN MARCH OF 2005. THE SAME PARTS FAILED AND THE SAME DIAGNOSIS WAS MADE BY A DIFFERENT VW DEALERSHIP. THE CLUTCH FAILED IN THE SPRINGS BUT SHOWED NO OUTWARD SIGNS OF ABUSE OR EXCESSIVE WEAR. THE CLUTCH HAD APPROXIMATELY 50 K MILES OF USE BUT STILL HAD SIGNIFICANT MATERIAL LEFT ON THE CLUTCH PADS. THE FAILURE OF THE CLUTCH SPRINGS DAMAGED THE FLYWHEEL. AS  RESULT I HAD TO PAY FOR A NEW FLYWHELEL, THROWOUT BEARING AND CLUTCH PLATE. AN APPEAL TO VW WAS REJECTED AND THEY SAID THAT THE DECISION WAS THE DEALERSHIP'S AND THAT THEY WOULD STAND BY THAT.  I CONSIDER THIESE FAILURES TO BE CAUSED BY WEAK PARTS PROVIDED BY VW OF AMERICA.  THIS SECOND FAILURE COST ME $1600.00 IN REPAIR COSTS.",

THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THEN GAVE US THE RUN AROUND FOR A FEW MONTHS.   THEY WANTED OIL CHANGE RECEIPTS, WHICH WE PROVIDED.

IT TURNED OUT TO BE A BAD COIL PACK, #2 CYLINDER NOT FIRING. THE TECHNICIAN TOLD MY HUSBAND THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMEN PROBLEM FOR VW. I DID AN INTERNET SEARCH TO FIND OUT HOW COMMEN THIS WAS. TO MY SUPRISE, THIS IS EXTREAMLY COMMON TO VW. THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE 1.8 TURBO MOTORS BUT NONE ON THE 2.8 V6 MOTOR. MY CONCERN IS WHY NO RECALL ON 2.8 MOTOR IF THIS IS SO COMMON ON THIS MODEL.     PLEASE REPLY. THANKS KATJA HERRMANN",

I AM TRYING TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT FROM VW OF AMERICA FOR THESE EXPENSES.      IN ADDITION THIS YEAR I ALSO HAD TO PAY $300.00 TO HAVE THE PASSENGER DOOR LATCH REPAIRED AS THE SPRING BROKE THAT ALLOWED ME TO OPEN THE DOOR WITH THE DOOR HANDLE.     REGARDLESS, MY CAR IS KEPT IN PRISTINE CONDITION, AND IN NO WAY SHOULD I BE INCURRING THESE TYPE OF REPAIRS ON A VEHICLE THAT HAS ONLY 20K MILES ON THE ODOMETER.  PLEASE HELP ME.  *AK",

I COULDN'T FIND A RENTAL AT THIS PRICE.  BVW HAS ARRANGEMENTS W/ ECR (OPEN M-F) NEXT DOOR ON RT. 130 -- VW CUSTOMERS CAN GET A CAR FOR $25/DAY.  THOUGHT I HAD INSURANCE THROUGH MY CREDIT CARD, SO I TURNED DOWN LOSS DAMAGE WAIVER ($13/DAY).  ECR FOUND DAMAGE ON CAR.  I AM UNCERTAIN HOW OR WHEN DAMAGE OCCURRED.  I TOLD THEM I WOULD CALL MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY, AND WAS TOLD THEY WOULDN'T COVER ME -- I DIDN'T PAY FOR THE RENTAL.  WHY WASN'T THIS MADE CLEAR AT THE TIME OF RENTAL BY BVW OR ECR?  I CONTACTED VW TO ASK THEM WHY THEY DON'T NOTIFY THEIR CUSTOMERS OF THIS PITFALL, AND THEY SAID THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO -- VW CUSTOMER CARE # 30127362.

ANOTHER ONE WILL LIKELY MALFUNCTION, LEAVING ME STRANDED AT ANY TIME. BECAUSE I HAD INSUFFICIENT INSURANCE, I PAID $548.90 THIS TIME.  WHAT WILL I PAY NEXT TIME?    WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS IN DEALING WITH VOLKSWAGEN?  IF PARTS WERE READILY AVAILABLE ON MY CAR, WHICH IS UNDER WARRANTY, I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO WAIT TEN DAYS FOR CAR REPAIRS.
