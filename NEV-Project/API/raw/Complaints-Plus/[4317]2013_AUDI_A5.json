        "summary": "About 3 weeks ago I noticed the beginning of a steering problem. I first noticed that the wheel seemed to require more than normal force to turn, especially in about the 10 and 2 o\u2019clock position. It would behave pretty normally most of the time, but then, unpredictably, this would happen. Now it seems to be pretty constant. The steering wheel now requires much more force than usual, but only when in certain positions. Otherwise, everything appears normal. A couple of days ago I needed to try an evasive maneuver, which required sudden, hard steering. However, the response of the car was not what I expected under similar conditions with other Audi\u2019s I own. This is an obvious safety concern. There appears to be a repair bulletin by Audi, but only Audis that are still under warranty will be fixed for free by Audi. I strongly believe this is a serious safety issue that deserves a safety recall of all affected Audi\u2019s, and repair at Audi expense.",

THIS \"FEELING\" HAS OCCURRED FROM 25MPH ON UP  PAST INTERSTATE SPEEDS (70). THE PROBLEM INITIALLY OCCURRED FROM THE 11 TO 1 O'CLOCK POSITIONS WHERE THE  STEERING WHEEL CAN BE MOVED RIGHT TO LEFT WITH NO RESPONSE TO THE CAR. PROBLEM HAS PERSISTED AND NOW  OCCURS AT OTHER POINTS IN THE STEERING MOTION. CONTACT WITH AUDI USA CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS ONLY PRODUCED  RESPONSE FROM AUDI OF \"WORK WITH YOUR DEALER\". AUDI DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THIS AS A SAFETY ISSUE, BUT I AM  FAILING TO UNDERSTAND HOW A \"STEERING\" ISSUED CAN NOT BE SAFETY RELATED. NOW THAT THE PROBLEM IS WORSENING, ONE HAS AN UNEASY FEELING DRIVING THE CAR.  *TR",

THIS NOTCHY FEEL CREATES A NEED FOR CONSTANT CORRECTION JUST TO KEEP THE VEHICLE TRAVELING IN A STRAIGHT PATH.  I BELIEVE THIS IS THE RESULT OF THE NEW ELECTROMECHANICAL STEERING THAT AUDI IMPLEMENTED IN 2013 MODELS.  THIS PROBLEM IS IMPACTING MANY DRIVERS ACROSS ALL MODEL LINES AND I FEEL THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.  I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT THIS IS AN INTERMITTENT ISSUE THAT IS NOT PREVALENT EACH DAY, HOWEVER MY ABILITY TO KEEP MY CAR TRAVELING IN A STRAIGHT PATH IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN THE ISSUE ARISES.  AT INTERSTATE SPEEDS IT CREATES A SENSATION THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE CONTROL OF YOUR VEHICLE.  I HAVE REPORTED THIS ISSUE TO AUDI OF AMERICA AND HAVE RECEIVED NO RESPONSE OR FOLLOW UP.  I HAVE ALSO HAD MY VEHICLE LOOKED AT BY THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY ARE REPORTING THAT THE VEHICLE IS FUNCTIONING NORMALLY.  THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE AN ACCIDENT OR FATALITY OCCURS AS A RESULT OF FAULTY STEERING COMPONENTS. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO READ THE CONCERNS OF OTHER OWNERS.
