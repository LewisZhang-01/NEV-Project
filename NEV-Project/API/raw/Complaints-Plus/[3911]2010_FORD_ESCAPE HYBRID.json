Mileage was 84,977. I was told that dealer found that new Torque Sensor was not needed. System was reprogrammed. After this I experienced intermittent failure of the electric power steering. Brought vehicle to Kelly Ford 1/29/2020.  Mileage was 85,811. They could not duplicate the steering failure. On 1/16/2022, the power steering has completely failed, & a power steering assist fault message has appeared. Mileage is now 91,945 Two Ford dealers told me that Ford will likely not cover the repair, since the recall was \u201cclosed\u201d after they saw the vehicle.  I called Ford customer service 1/19/2022, & was told the same. She said that Ford does not open recalls.   I think this is wrong, since the problematic Torque Sensor was not replaced during my recall visit. This repair could exceed $2K, since the steering column must now be replaced. I think that Ford should be held responsible to repair my vehicle correctly. Especially since the vehicle can no longer be safely driven. Ford states that upon failure, vehicle will revert to manual steering mode. NOT TRUE. When power steering fails, it is much harder to turn than a manual steering equipped vehicle, & therefore unsafe to drive.

First, the \"power steering assist fault\" notification/error appeared in my message center, and steering became difficult, but the error disappeared after a few seconds and I was then able to steer easily. I parked my car and turned it off. When I turned the car on again about three minutes later, the \"power steering assist fault\" message appeared at startup and did not disappear. The power steering has not worked since.   The error code \"power steering assist fault\" signifies that the power steering control module cannot determine the driver's steering input. Because the electric power steering system cannot determine what direction the driver is steering, the EPS shuts down.   This exact error was the cause of a recall that began May 27, 2014 (see NHTSA campaign # 14V284000) (see also Ford recall # 14S05). The recall states that \"vehicles potentially affected are certain 2008-2011 model year Fold Escape & Mercury Mariner vehicles built at the Kansas City Assembly Plant from August 18, 2006, to September 11, 2010.\" My vehicle meets all of these criteria; my vehicle also has experienced the specific error mentioned in the recall documents.  I noticed no other errors or malfunctions with the vehicle at the time. The vehicle is available for inspection as needed. The error has been examined by an individual with knowledge of vehicle error codes and repair.   The first EPS system fault occurred while I was actively driving. If the EPS had not briefly restored itself, I would have been stuck in an intersection and blocked the entrance to a large parking lot. Additionally, I had just pulled off of a highway; if the EPS had faulted a minute earlier, I would have been unable to leave the highway and would have been in a more perilous situation.",

This is a safety issue effecting many Ford vehicles and the symptoms may not surface until beyond the CSP 13N03 time limits imposed by Ford, as in my case. These electronic throttle body hesitations, surges and stalls are very dangerous and result in compromised safety for the driver, their passengers and others on the road. I have come very close to a collision on two separate occasions because of this issue. The NHTSA should force Ford to reclassify this issue as a recall with no time nor mileage limits or lift the current program time and mileage limits for people like me who are beyond the time limit who have just recently developed this problem. This is a mechanical defect as well as a safety issue. 3. Problem confirmed by Ford dealership. 4. Dash warnings - check engine light and wrench lights illuminated. In my case, these have gone on and off, vehicle demonstrates hesitations, surges, stalls, then resets itself and the vehicle functions normally. This has happened twice over the last few months.

THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY WAS QUICK TO REJECT REPAIR FOR RECALLS OR WARRANTIES AS IT IS A DIRECT EXPENSE TO FORD MOTOR COMPANY. THEY SAID MY RECOURSE WAS TO CONTACT FORD MOTOR COMPANY WHICH I DID AT THE DEALERSHIP. AFTER CONTACT FORD MOTOR THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO RECALL WOULD BE HONORED AS THE RECALL WAS ALREADY PERFORMED IN 2014 WITH THE PREVIOUS OWNER AND ONLY THE SOFTWARE WAS UPDATED.

THEY INSISTED IT WAS ONLY FOR A FEW VEHICLES YET IT IS THE SAME EXACT RECALL WARNING LISTED.  AMERICAN CORPORATIONS AND GOVERNMENT BODIES LACK COMMON SENSE WHILE THRIVING ON GREED AND CONTROL.  OBVIOUSLY THE EXACT SAME PARTS WERE USED AND THE EXACT SAME RECALL HAS BEEN LISTED, BUT MAGICALLY DUE TO GREED AND POOR COMMON SENSE, I AM BEING TOLD TO JUMP OFF A CLIFF.  LET'S FINALLY TAKE CARE OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND BUILD TRUST TO ONE ANOTHER.  THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF COMMENTS STATING THE EXACT SAME THING IN WHICH FORD REFUSES TO FIX THIS.  NHTSA, YOU ARE OFFICIALLY ON NOTICE TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT AND NECESSARY AND MAKE FORD FIX THIS FOR EVERYONE AND NOT WHOM THEY SO CHOOSE.  TIRED OF THE GOVERNMENT BEING BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING?  ME TOO.

AT THAT MOMENT I WAS IN THE LEFT LANE OF A 3-LANE HIGHWAY WITH OTHER VEHICLES APPROACHING FROM BEHIND AND PASSING AT 50 MPH. MY VEHICLE SLOWED TO ABOUT 5 MPH AS I ATTEMPTED TO MOVE TO THE RIGHT WHERE I HOPED IT HAD ENOUGH MOMENTUM THAT I COULD MAKE IT TO THE TOP OF THE GRADE AND EXIT THE HIGHWAY. THE RIGHT-HAND EXIT WAS DOWNHILL AND I WAS ABLE TO COAST AND CREEP INTO A MARKET PARKING LOT WHERE I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND TRIED TO CALM DOWN. FROM THE VEHICLE MANUAL I LEARNED THAT THE 'YELLOW WRENCH' INDICATED 'THROTTLE CONTROL OR DRIVE TRAIN PROBLEMS.' AS IT TURNED OUT IT WAS A SUNDAY MORNING AND I DID NOT HAVE A PHONE WITH ME SO I DECIDED TO TRY RESTARTING THE ENGINE. IT STARTED AND THE YELLOW WRENCH DID NOT ILLUMINATE. AFTER A SHORT TEST DRIVE IN THE PARKING LOT I DECIDED TO CANCEL MY ERRANDS AND TRY TO RETURN HOME, A DISTANCE OF A FEW MILES. I DROVE AT 25-30 MPH ON RESIDENTIAL SIDE STREETS AND MADE IT HOME WITH NO FURTHER PROBLEMS. THE NEXT DAY I TOOK THE CAR INTO THE LOCAL FORD DEALER AND DESCRIBED WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I WAS TOLD THEY WOULD LOOK INTO IT AND REPORT BACK. LATER I WAS INFORMED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS A DEFECTIVE THROTTLE BODY AND THEY HAD A REPLACEMENT PART. WHEN I CAME IN TO PICK UP THE CAR I WAS INFORMED THAT THERE WAS NO CHARGE BECAUSE THE REPAIR 'WAS UNDER WARRANTY!' THIS WAS A BIG SURPRISE, SINCE I HAD NEVER RECEIVED ANY NOTICE OF A POTENTIAL PROBLEM NOR OF A WARRANTY EXTENSION.

I IMMEDIATELY GOT OFF THE NEXT EXIT AND PARKED AT A GAS STATION.  I TURNED THE CAR OFF, BUT IT WOULD NOT START FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES.  I FINALLY GOT IT TO START AND DROVE QUICKLY TO WORK.  I TOOK THE CAR THAT AFTERNOON TO FORD SERVICE.  THEY SAID IT WAS MY IGNITION, SO THEY CHANGED THE PART AND CHARGED ME OVER $320.  WHEN I DRIVE MY CAR THE NEXT MORNING, IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  I TOOK MY CAR TO FORD AGAIN THAT MORNING.  NOW THEY TELL ME THE BOARD THAT HAD THE ELECTRICAL PARTS IS CORRODED, SO THEY CHANGED THAT AND CHARGED OVER $720.  THE NEXT DAY AFTER I TOOK THE CAR HOME IT HAPPENED FOR A QUICK MOMENT, BUT THEN IT STOPPED.  TODAY 10/18/17 WHICH IS 2 DAYS AFTER I PICKED MY CAR UP FROM FORD SERVICE I LET MY CAR WARM UP IN THE MORNING FOR ABOUT 10 MINS, BUT WHEN I GOT IN THE CAR ALL THE WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON AGAIN.  THIS TIME THE CAR WOULD NOT START AT ALL AND THE ANTI-THEFT WARNING LIGHT KEPT BLINKING EACH TIME.  SO I HAD TO CALL A TOW TRUCK.  SO NOW I HAVE NO CAR, I'M OUT OVER $1,000 AND I HAVE TO GET A CAR RENTAL.  AND FORD SERVICE CONTINUES TO CHARGE EACH TIME INCLUDING A DIAGNOSTIC TEST FOR OVER $100.  I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD AN ANTI-THEFT SYSTEM AND I DON'T NEED ONE.  THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR, BUT FORD SERVICE IS NOT ABLE TO FIX THIS.      I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING THE CAR AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO NOW.  IN MY OPINION THIS IS A FORD MANUFACTURING PROBLEM AND I SHOULD NOT BE CHARGED TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.

I WAITED ABOUT 5 MINUTES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. THEN I STARTED THE CAR AND THE PROBLEM WAS GONE.  SECOND INCIDENT: MY WIFE WAS COMING HOME FROM WORK ON APRIL 11TH, 2013 WHEN SHE STOPPED AT A STOP SIGN.  WHEN SHE BEGAN TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN ONTO A BUSY STREET, THE POWER STEERING WENT AGAIN. LUCKILY SHE MADE IT HOME SAFELY AND INFORMED ME OF WHAT HAPPENED. I TURNED THE CAR ON AND TOOK IT FOR A DRIVE. THE POWER STEERING WAS BACK ON. THERE WERE AT LEAST TWO MORE TIMES WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE POWER STEERING WENT OFF AND AFTER AWHILE CAME BACK ON. WE HAD A NEW POWER STEERING COLUMN ASSEMBLY PUT IN OUR FORD ESCAPE ON JUNE 6TH, 2013. LUCKILY WE HAD A FORD PREMIUM CARE WARRANTY PLAN AND THIS PROBLEM WAS COVERED, BUT HAD TO PAY $100 DEDUCTIBLE. RECENTLY FORD HAS ANNOUNCED A SAFETY RECALL ON THE POWER STEERING ASSEMBLY ON FORD ESCAPES MANUFACTURED IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. MY VIN NUMBER WAS NOT PART OF THAT SAFETY RECALL,  YET I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH MY POWER STEERING. WHAT WOULD I HAVE HAD TO PAY TO REPLACE THIS POWER STEERING IF I HADN'T HAD A WARRANTY PLAN? I WANT FORD TO REIMBURSE MY $100 DEDUCTIBLE, BUT THEY SAY SINCE MY VIN NUMBER AT THIS TIME WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL THEY WON'T REIMBURSE ME.

NOTICING THAT THE ACCELERATOR DID NOT ENGAGE AT ALL, I TURNED OFF THE TRUCK AND WAS GOING TO CALL FOR A TOW TRUCK. THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED TO TRY AND START IT TO SEE IF I COULD GET HOME ON MY OWN.

I HAVE GONE AHEAD AND PURCHASED THE NEW THROTTLE BODY AND AM HAVING MY MECHANIC INSTALL IT THIS WEEK.

THE NEXT MORNING, TRIED TO TAKE VEHICLE TO DEALERSHIP. STARTED VEHICLE, DROVE ACROSS THE STREET, AGAIN NO POWER. CALLED DEALERSHIP, THEY ARRANGED TO HAVE IT TOWED TO A NEIGHBORING DEALERSHIP BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET TO EVEN LOOK AT IT FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS. ERROR MESSAGE ON VEHICLE ACCORDING TO DEALERSHIP WAS P2112. UNABLE TO REPAIR AT THIS TIME DUE BACK ORDER OF PART. HAD THERE BEEN ANYONE BEHIND ME ON THE FIRST TWO OCCASIONS OR SOMEONE COMING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WHILE TRYING TO CROSS ROAD, SURELY I WOULD HAVE BEEN HIT. FORTUNATELY, I WAS NOT ON THE INTERSTATE WHEN THIS OCCURRED OR THE POTENTIAL FOR HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGH! THIS IS POSES AN UNSAFE SITUATION!!! I PURCHASED THIS CERTIFIED VEHICLE ONLY FOUR MONTHS AGO, WITH 50,271 MILES ON IT. I AM NOT CERTAIN IF I WILL FEEL CONFIDENT DRIVING THIS VEHICLE AGAIN. THE DEALERSHIP WANTS TO REASSURE THAT THE REPLACEMENT PART WILL FIX THE SITUATION, BUT I HAVE MY DOUBTS FOR A LONG TERM RESOLUTION.  *TR",

MULTIPLE CARS HAD TO SLAM ON BRAKES AND MAKE LAST-MINUTE LANE CHANGES TO AVOID COLLIDING WITH OTHER VEHICLES NOW FORCED TO DO A FRACTION OF THE SPEED LIMIT.  VERY SCARY.  ONCE STOPPED THE SUV IDLED HEAVILY AROUND 1000RPM AND THEN CUT OFF. I CALLED A MECHANIC WHO STATED TO TRY THE CAR AGAIN AND IT STARTED FINE BUT WITH CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON.  WAS ABLE TO DRIVE TO MECHANIC WITH THIS INCIDENT HAPPENING ONLY ONE MORE TIME (THIS TIME I STAYED NEXT TO EMERGENCY LANE WITH MY HAZARDS ON) AND HE STATED IT WAS CODE P2112 WHICH ON LOOKING UP, IS AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH MULTIPLE FORD ESCAPES 2009-2012 MODELS.  THIS WAS VERY DANGEROUS AND WHEN LOOKING UP INFO, IT SHOWS THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION WITH THE NHTSA AS OF LAST YEAR BUT NO INFO SINCE.  THIS IS HAPPENING FREQUENTLY, MY SPOUSE AND I WERE SO VERY LUCKY THAT NOTHING HAPPENED TO US.  I AM NOW TAKING THE VEHICLE TO FORD WHO STATES IT IS, OF COURSE, NOT UNDER WARRANTY.

I BOUGHT THE PART FROM THE DEALERSHIP AND CHANGED IT, EVER SINCE THAT FIX MY VEHICLE IS RUNNING EVEN BETTER THAN BEFORE. THE MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER THAT GAVE ME THE PART MENTIONED THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS ISSUE AND THAT USUALLY CHANGING THE THROTTLE BODY FIXES THE ISSUE, HE ALSO MENTIONED THAT IF A RECALL IS TO BE MADE TO JUST BRING BACK THE DEFECTIVE PART AND THE PROOF OF PURCHASE IN ORDER TO GET MY MONEY BACK. FORD SHOULD JUST STOP DENYING THIS ISSUE AND JUST ADMIT THAT THE ISSUE WAS NEVER FULLY FIXED.",

ON MY WAY HOME IT HAPPENED AGAIN.     I CONTACTED MY LOCAL FORD DEALER TO SEE IF I CAN BRING IT IN AND THEY WERE ABLE TO GET ME IN WED SEPT 17. ONCE I EXPLAINED TO THE SERVICEMAN WHAT HAPPENED, HE INFORMED ME THAT THEY HAVE BEEN FIXING THIS SAME PROBLEM FOR CONSUMERS ALL SUMMER. AFTER I PICKED MY CAR UP I GOGGLED THE ISSUE WITH THE THROTTLE BODY AND FOUND THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CONSUMERS WHO HAVE HAD TO EXPERIENCE THIS PROBLEM SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. AS A CONSUMER I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT FORD HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE AND I HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE MY CAR FIXED WHEN THEY ARE CLEARLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROBLEM. WHAT WILL IT TAKE FOR THEM TO TAKE CARE OF THIS ISSUE? WHY HAVEN'T FORD MOTOR COMPANY BEEN FORCED TO ISSUE A RECALL TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM TAKEN CARE OF? I WAS FORTUNATE THAT I WASN'T ON THE EXPRESSWAY YESTERDAY (WHICH IS MY USUAL ROUTE) WHEN THIS HAPPENED. THE OUTCOME COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE FORD HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS AND REFUND ME AND THE REST OF ITS CUSTOMERS FOR HAVING TO REPAIR OUR CARS WITH THEY ARE CLEARLY THE ONE'S THAT SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE.",

THEN, WHILE TURNING ACCROSS ON COMING TRAFFIC THE VEHICLE LOOSES ALL POWER WITH NO THROTTLE RESPONSE AND THE ENGINE LIGHT ILLUMINATED. AT THIS POINT I WAS STILL IN THE WAY OF ON COMING TRAFFIC AND COULD NOT ACCELERATE TO FINISH THE TURN. THANK GOD I DID IDLE TO SAFETY. I THEN STOPPED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND PUT THE VEHICLE IN PARK AND OBSERVED A VERY ROUGH IDLE AND NO THROTTLE RESPONSE AT ALL. I SHUT OFF THE VEHICLE AND RESTARTED IT AFTER THIRTY SECONDS AND IT RAN NORMAL AGAIN WITH THE ENGINE LIGHT OFF. I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A PARTS STORE TO HAVE THE THE ECM SCANNED FOR TROUBLE CODES. THE TECH COULD NOT RECOVER OR READ ANY CODES AT THAT TIME. I FOUND THAT TROUBLING AT THE TIME BUT FOUND OUT LATER THAT NOT ALL SCAN TOOLS CAN ACCESS STORED CODES. I HAD THIS OCCUR TWICE THE NEXT DAY WHILE DRIVING TO WORK. I THEN CALLED MY LOCAL FORD DEALER TO SCHEDULE SERVICE AND WHEN I TOLD HIM THE SYMPTOMS HE IMMEDIATELY KNEW THE PROBLEM. I ORDERED A NEW THROTTLE BODY ASSEMBLY PER THEIR INSTRUCTION AND ASKED IF THERE ARE ANY RECALLS OR TSB'S ON THIS ISSUE IF IT'S THAT COMMON. THE DEALER CHECKED AND FOUND A TSB ON THIS PROBLEM BUT NO RECALLS. I PERSONALLY FEEL THIS IS DEFINATELY A SAFETY CONCERN AND SHOULD TREATED AS THAT BEFORE SOMEONE DOES GET HURT OR WORSE, KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT. I CALLED FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE THE NEXT DAY TO FILE A COMPLAINT AND FIND OUT WHY THEY AREN'T BEING PROACTIVE WITH THIS SERIOUS ISSUE. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAVE NO KNOWN SAFETY RECALLS OR TSB'S AT THIS TIME. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS NOT SOMETHING THEY HAD ENCOUNTERED VERY OFTEN. SINCE THEN, I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS AND FOUND THAT IT IS VERY KNOWN AND BEING INVESTIGATED AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU.",

WHEN IT SETS OVER NIGHT OR FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME IT IS DRIVEABLE BUT AFTER A FEW MILES IT STARTS TO STALL AGAIN. DRIVING UNDER 30 MPH OR ACCELERATING SUPER SLOW SEEMS TO HELP SOME TIMES BUT NOT ALWAYS. STILL PROBABLY NOT VERY SAFE TO DRIVE IT LIKE THAT ESPECIALLY PULLING ONTO A BUSY STREET OR OUT INTO A BUSY INTERSECTION.  *TR",

I ATTEMPTED TO CONTINUE FORWARD MOMENTUM BY APPLYING PRESSURE TO THE ACCELERATOR BUT WITH NO RESPONSE FROM THE VEHICLE. I COASTED THE VEHICLE ACROSS LANES OF TRAFFIC TO THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY. ONCE STOPPED I PLACED THE VEHICLE IN PARK AND THE ENGINE WAS SPUTTERING AND LOSING RPMS. I IDENTIFIED THE POWER TRAIN (WRENCH LIGHT) ON CONTROL CONSOLE WAS LITE AT WHICH I OBSERVED THE VEHICLE. I APPLIED PRESSURE TO THE ACCELERATOR TO INCREASE RPMS AT WHICH NO SUCCESS WAS NOTED AT THAT POINT I CUT THE POWER TO THE VEHICLE. I ALLOWED THE VEHICLE TO SIT FOR 5 MINUTES AND THEN RESTARTED THE ENGINE WITH SOME SPUTTERING. AT THAT POINT I APPLIED PRESSURE TO THE ACCELERATOR AND IMMEDIATELY THE RPMS INCREASED AND THE VEHICLE RETURNED TO OPERATING NORMALLY.

THE WRENCH LIGHT ALSO CAME ON. AFTER TURNING THE ENGINE OFF AND RESTARTING, THE WRENCH LIGHT WENT OUT AND THE CAR WORKED NORMALLY. THIS HAPPENED APPROXIMATELY 5-7 TIMES BEGINNING AROUND JUNE 3, 2013 UNTIL I DECIDED TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP ON JUNE 18, 2013. I PAID FORD $120 TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. THEY WERE UNABLE TO FIND ANYTHING WRONG, BUT DID RESET THE SHIFT POINTS. IT DID NOT HAPPEN AGAIN UNTIL JULY 12, 2013. WHILE DRIVING TO WORK AT APPROXIMATELY 60MPH, THE ENGINE DROPPED OUT OF GEAR AND THE WRENCH LIGHT CAME ON. I HAD NO ENGINE RESPONSE WITH THE GAS PEDAL AND HAD TO CAREFULLY COAST OVER TO THE SERVICE/EMERGENCY LANE. WHILE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, I CALLED FORD AND THEY TOLD ME AFTER I BROUGHT MY ESCAPE IN, MULTIPLE ESCAPES AND FUSIONS HAD COME IN WITH THE SAME PROBLEM WHICH WAS TROUBLESHOOT DOWN TO THE THROTTLE BODY. THEY ORDERED THE THROTTLE BODY AND SAID THEY WOULD CALL ME WHEN IT CAME IN. I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION, RESTARTED, AND CONTINUED DRIVING. APPROXIMATELY 2 MINUTES AFTER GETTING BACK ON THE ROAD IT HAPPENED AGAIN, ONLY THIS TIME THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON ALONG WITH THE WRENCH LIGHT. THIS TIME AFTER RESTARTING THE ENGINE, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STAYED ON. I DROVE TO FORD AND LEFT IT RUNNING SO THEY COULD ACQUIRE ANY CODES THAT WERE ACTIVE. THE THROTTLE BODY WAS ORDERED ON JULY 12, 2013 AND FORD HAS NO ESTIMATE OF A SHIPMENT DATE. THE CAR IS CURRENTLY WITH FORD AWAITING THE PART WHILE THEY PAY FOR MY RENTAL.

I LOOKED IN MY OWNER'S MANUAL AND DISCOVERED THE LIGHT MEANT THAT I HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE POWER TRAIN OR THROTTLE AND THAT I SHOULD TAKE THE CAR TO THE DEALER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND TURNED THE KEY OFF. THE ENGINE STARTED AGAIN, AND I DROVE IT HOME. THE NEXT DAY THE SAME THING HAPPENED TWICE ON THE WAY TO VETERANS' FORD IN METAIRIE. I LEFT THE CAR WITH THEM FOR FOUR HOURS, BUT THEY COULD FIND NO PROBLEM. THIS STALLING CONTINUED TO HAPPEN TWO OR THREE TIMES A WEEK.

ON MONDAY, I TOOK MY WIFE TO A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT AND RAN SOME ERRANDS, AND MY ESCAPE STALLED FOUR TIMES IN TWENTY-FIVE MILES. YESTERDAY WHEN THE SAME THING HAPPENED, THE ENGINE-SHAPED LIGHT ON THE DASH CAME ON IN ADDITION TO THE \"WRENCH\" LIGHT. SO TODAY I TOOK IT IN TO VETERANS' FORD AGAIN AND LEFT IT.

ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT CAUSE AN ACCIDENT, THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN RESPONSIVENESS OF THE VEHICLE AND THE FAILURE TO ACCELERATE COULD HAVE EASILY LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT AND/OR BODILY INJURY. AS IT IS, I AM WITHOUT MY VEHICLE FOR 1-2 WEEKS.  *TR",

BOTH MY WIFE AND I HAVE BUMPED INTO THE CAR IN FRONT OF US ABOUT 10 TIMES ONLY CAUSING MINIMAL DAMAGE AND NEVER FILED ON ANY INSURANCE.

I GOT PAST THE RT. 18 RAMP AND GOT INTO THE RIGHT LANE I MADE IT ABOUT 1.5 MILES NEAR RUTGERS COOK COLLEGE WHERE THIS ISSUE HAPPENED AGAIN, THIS TIME I GOT ONTO THE SHOULDER BEFORE THE CAR CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP.  ONCE AGAIN I PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND IT STARTED UP AGAIN I DROVE IT HOME APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES BEFORE LEAVING IT PARKED UNTIL TUESDAY MAY 14TH WHEN MY WIFE AND I COULD DROP IT OFF AT THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP, MALOUF FORD IN NORTH BRUNSWICK NJ.    THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN , THE CHECK ENGINE LAMP OR THE WRENCH ICON DO NOT DISPLAY UNTIL THIS PART FAILS. UNEXPECTEDLY LOSING POWER AND STOPPING ON ONE OF THE BUSIEST MOST TRAVELED PORTION OF ROUTE 1 IS SCARY. I AM GLAD THAT MY 2 YEAR OLD SON AND MY PREGNANT WIFE WERE NOT INJURED WHEN THIS OCCURRED.

I COULDN'T MOVE THE CAR TO GET OVER ONTO THE SHOULDER.  I STARTED TO PANIC!  MY ALIGNMENT WAS A LITTLE OFF I GUESS, SO MY TIRES LED ME TO THE LEFT (THANK GOD) & I WAS ABLE TO STOP MY CAR ON THE SHOULDER BY SLOWING DOWN & LETTING MY CAR GLIDE OVER. I HAD POWER STEERING FLUID AT THE TIME, BUT YET I WASN'T EVEN ABLE TO STRONG ARM THE STEERING WHEEL TO GET IT TO MOVE.  IT WAS COMPLETELY LOCKED!  THE FORD DEALERSHIP TOLD ME I HAD TO HAVE THE WHOLE STEERING SYSTEM REPLACED AND WILL COST ME $1,200.  MY (2010) 3 YEAR OLD CAR IS NO LONGER UNDER IT'S 36,000 WARRANTY, SO OF COURSE FORD THINKS I SHOULD PAY FOR IT!  HOW CAN A STEERING WHEEL NOT BE ABLE TO MOVE SIDE TO SIDE???  IT'S A STEERING WHEEL!  THIS WASN'T CAUSED BY ANY LACK OF MAINTENANCE OR VEHICLE UP KEEP.  THERE SHOULD BE NO REASON A 3 YEAR OLD CAR SHOULD NEED A WHOLE NEW STEERING SYSTEM!  THIS COULD HAVE KILLED MY 2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER & I IF THE EXPRESS WAY STARTED TO CURVE.  I WAS BLESSED I-75 WAS GOING STRAIGHT AT THE TIME!

I HAD TO PAY A DIAGNOSTIC FEE OF 150 SOMETHING DOLLARS.  TEST-DROVE VEHICLE WITH MECHANIC BUT IT WAS VERY HARD TO DUPLICATE. THEY HAD VEHICLE 3 SEPARATE TIMES VEHICLE ENDED UP STAYING BY THE 3RD TIME WITH THEM FROM A THURSDAY TILL A TUESDAY I WAS TOLD IT WAS RUST ON THE SUB FRAME SHOCKED THAT FORD HAD A SERVICE BULLETIN FOR AND THAT THEY HAD TO REMOVE SOME TYPE OF BOLTS. SOUND WOULD BE GONE FOR A FEW DAYS BUT MAYBE SHAKE BACK LOOSE. SOUND NOW COMING FROM THE FRONT. I CALLED BACK TO THE 1ST DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER BASICALLY DON'T BRING IT BACK THERE IT IS A WASTE OF THEIR TIME BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE HE ASKED ME WHERE I PURCHASED IT AND WAS TOLD TO TAKE BACK TO ORIGINAL DEALERSHIP. I MUST SAY EARLY ON INTO THE SITUATION I WROTE TO FORD BECAUSE I WAS VERY DISGUSTED THAT I HAD TO PAY A DIAGNOSTIC FEE FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM TO FORD ALL THIS TIME AND WANTED MY FEE BACK. THEY TOLD ME SINCE IT WAS NOT FIXED AND THE 1ST DEALERSHIP COULD NOT REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT IS WRONG TAKE IT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL DEALERSHIP OF PURCHASE. I FOUND OUT THAT AGAIN I HAVE TO PAY ANOTHER DIAGNOSTIC FEE AND I PRAY THAT THEY FIND OR HEAR SOMETHING DUE TO THE NOISE IS NOT HEARD ALL THE TIME. AGAIN, I AM OUT OF MORE MONEY. I DECIDED NOT TO WASTE ANYMORE TIME PAYING DIAGNOSTIC FEES AND MAYBE HOPE THE  VEHICLE FALLS APART I FEEL LIKE I AM UP AGAINST A WALL I  KNOW THIS IS MY LAST TIME DEALING  WITH FORD TIME TO MOVE ON ESPECIALLY WITH THIS 36,000 MILE WARRANTY CRAP.

BY ACCIDENT I UNLOCKED THE REAR LIFTGATE GLASS WITH THE REMOTE. (I DID NOT THINK TO RE-LOCK IT BEFORE OPENING THE LIFTGATE.) AFTER MY BAGS WERE LOADED, I CLOSED THE LIFTGATE FIRMLY (NOT SOFTLY, BUT NOT LIKE KING KONG); UPON IMPACT OF CLOSING, THE REAR LIFTGATE GLASS EXPLODED, SHOWERING GLASS ALL OVER THE PAVEMENT AND IN THE BACK / ON MY LUGGAGE.   THERE HAD BEEN NO CONTACT WITH LUGGAGE IN THE BACK / MY BAGS WERE LOW-PROFILE (I HAVE PHOTOS TO PROVE; ALSO, I HAVE A 3RD-PARTY WITNESS WHO WAS LOADING HIS CAR SEVERAL SPACES AWAY.) THE AMBIENT AIR TEMPERATURE WAS AROUND 60 DEGREES; THE WEATHER WAS FAIR / CLEAR. THE CAR HAD NOT BEEN ENTERED SINCE THE DAY BEFORE; I DID NOT EVER USE THE REAR DEFROST OR WIPER DURING THE COURSE OF MY THREE-DAY RENTAL. WHEN REVIEWING THE DAMAGE, I NOTED HOW HEAVY THE REAR WIPER MOTOR IS THAT IS ATTACHED DIRECTLY TO THE GLASS. THE SUSPENSION RODS FOR HOLDING THE LIFTGATE GLASS IN THE RAISED POSITION MUST BE VERY STRONG TO SUPPORT THAT MOTOR, ESPECIALLY WITH THE SHALLOW ANGLES INVOLVED. (OTHERS REPORTING EXPLODING REAR WINDOWS EXPLAIN THAT THE COMPRESSED GAS INSIDE THESE DEVICES CAUSES THE EXPLOSIVE NATURE OF THE FAILURE.)  PRESUMABLY THIS FAILURE OCCURRED BECAUSE THE GLASS WAS NOT LOCKED, AS IT HAD NOT EXPLODED DURING PREVIOUS CLOSINGS OF THE LIFTGATE. THERE IS NO WARNING IN THE OWNERS MANUAL TO BE SURE THAT THE GLASS IS LOCKED BEFORE CLOSING THE LIFTGATE. POSSIBLY THERE WAS AN INVISIBLE DEFECT IN THE GLASS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE.  I WAS \"BOOBY-TRAPPED\" BY THIS CAR. IN MY 53 YEARS I HAVE NEVER DAMAGED A VEHICLE SIMPLY BY OPENING AND CLOSING ITS DOORS. THERE WERE NO OTHER FACTORS THAN THOSE DESCRIBED ABOVE; I HAVE PHOTOS, A 3RD PARTY WITNESS, AND WILL BE HAPPY TO TESTIFY THESE EVENTS IN COURT.

I TOOK IT TO THE FORD DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND THEY TOOK IT FOR A DRIVE AND FOUND NOTHING WRONG.  THEY THEN DID A DIAGNOSTIC AND SAID THEY FOUND THE FACTORY FAILED TO ENTER ALL THE CORRECT CODING FOR THE TRANSMISSION SO THEY KEPT THE CAR AND UPDATED IT.

THE TECHNICIAN HAS MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE A STEADY STREAM OF 2009 FORD ESCAPE OWNERS IN THE SHOP WITH SIMILAR PROBLEMS, BUT THERE CLEARLY IS NO REAL SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.   THIS IS A BRAND NEW TRANSMISSION THAT HAS BEEN RUSHED INTO THE ESCAPE TO IMPROVE FUEL ECONOMY WITHOUT PROPER TESTING.
