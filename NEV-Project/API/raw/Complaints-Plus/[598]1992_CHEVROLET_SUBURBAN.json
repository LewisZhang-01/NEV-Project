I PUT NEW ROTORS AND PADS ON THE FRONT AND NEW REAR DRUMS AND SHOES AND REPEATEDLY BLED THE SYSTEM WITH SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT. IT ACTS AS THOUGH THERE IS A RESTRICTION IN THE BRAKE LINE TO BOTH FRONT AND REAR. IT ACTS AS THOUGH THEY DESIGNED THE THING NOT TO STOP QUICKLY. I UNPLUGGED THE MOTOR TO THE ABS SO THAT AT LEAST IT WOULD SQUEAL A TIRE. THE LACK OF SURE LOW SPEED STOPS HAS CAUSED 2 NEAR MISS ACCIDENTS AND 1 T BONE WHICH HAS RAISED OUR INSURANCE RATES. I HAVE LEARNED TO DRIVE THE THING ANTICIPATING STOPS AND PREBRAKING. I WENT TO THE DEALER AND JUST LIKE WITH THE WINDSHIELD WIPER CIRCUIT BOARD THAT SHORTED OUT WHEN IT GETS WET THEY TOLD ME THAT FOR MY SPECIFIC MODEL THERE WERE NO RECALLS AND THEY REFUSED TO LOOK AT IT.

ANOTHER VEHICLE WAS ENTERING THE HIGHWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED, DESPITE THE SLICK ROAD CONDITIONS. THIS VEHICLE HIT A SLICK SPOT ON THE HIGHWAY AND SLIDE COMPLETE ACROSS THE THREE LANE HIGHWAY, INWHICH I WAS TRAVELING ON THE FARTHEST LANE.  THERE WERE ABOUT 4 OTHER CARS THAT HAD TO SLAM ON THEIR BRAKES AND BASICALLY COME TO A COMPLETE STOP IN ORDER TO AVOID THE VEHICLE THAT WAS SKIDDING THROUGH THE HIGHWAY.  MY ANTILOCK BRAKES KICKED IN WITH A LOUD THUG. AND THE ANTILOCK LIGHT AND BRAKE LIGHT CAME ON TOO.  BUT IT NEVER READJUSTED ITSELF AFTER THIS INCIDENT.  THE VEHICLE HAD  TO BE TAKEN INTO REPAIR TO RESET THE ABS.  THE FIRST TIME HAPPENED IN JULY 1999 AND WAS REPAIRED IN EARLY AUGUST.  THIS SECOND INCIDENT DID NOT WARRENT THE ABS TO KICK IN.  I BELIEVE THAT THE ABS   ARE OVERLY SENSITIVE  AND NEED TO BE REPROGRAMED. I HEARD ON A NEWS REPORT THAT THE CHEVROLET SUBURBAN WAS BEING RECALLED FOR ITS FAULTY ABS BRAKES FROM 1999 THROUGH 1992.  HOWEVER, I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THE 1992 CHEVROLET SUBURBAN  IS BEING RECALLED FOR THIS PROBLEM.

THE ANTI LOCK MECHANISM DID NOT ACTIVATE AND THERE WAS NO SLIDING OR SKIDDING.  I RAN INTO THE BACK OF THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME AT ABOUT 5 MPH.  THERE WAS RAIN PRESENT, BUT IT WAS LIGHT RAIN ITH NO WATER STANDING ON THE ROAD.  THE SECOND OCCASION WAS IN HOUSTON TX ON MAY 28, 1999.  MY DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING THE SUBURBAN ON THE SAM HOUSTON TOLL ROAD WHEN SHE WENT TO CHANGE LANES.  SHE DISCOVERED THAT SOMEONE WAS OVERTAKING HER FROM BEHIND AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED IN THE LANE THAT SHE WANTED TO BE IN.  SHE PULLED THE WHEEL IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, SAW SOMEONE IN THE ADJACENT LANE, PULLED THE WHEEL IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND APPLIED THE BRAKES, HARD.  THE SUBURBAN'S REAR WHEELS LOCKED, AND THE SUBURBAN MADE A 180 DEGREE TURN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, AND EXITTED THE ROADWAY BACKWARD AT ABOUT 20 MPH STRIKING A CONCRETE BARRIER.  I HAVE SPENT ABOUT  $1000 MAKING THE SUBURBAN DRIVABLE, AND I HAVE NOT GOTTEN INTO THE BODY WORK YET.  I FEEL THAT BOTH OCCURANCES HAVE BEEN CAUSED AT LEAST IN PART BY FAILURE OF THE FOUR WHEEL ANTI LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM.  THE RIGHT REAR WHEEL THREW THE TREAD SIX DAYS LATER ON THE WAY HOME.  I DON'T THINK IT WAS DESIGNED TO GO SIDEWAYS.( DOT NUMBER: AN11LX1127 TIRE SIZE: LT24575R16 )",
