This should never happen in a passenger car and the manufacturer should have better QUALITY CONTROL and prevent these defects from leaving the plants.  I have a MS in Mechanical Engineering and have knowledge of the tire designs, as we did research for Firestone in the 1980's at my university, and this is definitely a defect within a weak part of the fabric in the sidewall.  If you would like the tire for your investigation, please let me know ASAP. Other industries like the Medical and Pharma areas would not allow this kind of thing to happen and passenger vehicles with defective parts or components should never jeopardize any passenger to be in this kind of situation.  Luckily, it was very early in the morning, with very light traffic, and no one in my car or any of the cars around me got hurt, as I was able to maneuver to the right side of the highway.",

I THEN TOOK IT TO GMC PAID ANOTHER $150 FOR THEM TO DO A DIAGNOSIS TEST. THEY ALSO DID NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT BUT SEEN THAT IT HAD A EXTENDED WARRANTY OF THE THROTTLES AND SAID THAT COULD BE IT. AFTER CHANGING THAT THE PROBLEM STILL CONTINUED. THE ONLY THING THAT THE GUY TOLD ME FROM ME EXPLAINING THE PROBLEMS IS IT COULD BE THE BRAKE SENSER. PAID &170.00. PROBLEM STILL CONTINUED NOTHING HAS CHANGED. THIS IS DANGEROUS AND COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT, THE CAR TURNING COMPLETELY OFF ON ME HESSITATING TO DRIVE AND ACCELERATING ON IT'S OWN WHEN ON PARK IS DANGEROUS. I HAVE DONE MORE THAN MY PARK IN TAKING THE CAR TO SEE WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT YET NO ONE CAN FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT THE MACHINE SAYS NOTHING WHEN I WANT THE PROBLEM TO ACURE TO SHOW THEM WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT IT DOES NOT DO IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. BUT THIS IS DANGEROUS VERY VERY DANGEROUS. I PAID ALOT WITH NO RESULTS TO SHOW FOR IT. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AND HAVE IT CHECKED.",

THE 2008 GMC YUKON XL DENALI WOULD STOP ACCELERATING FOR 2-3 SECONDS WHEN THE GAS PEDAL IS PRESSED. MOST OF THE TIME IT IS WHEN I AM TRYING TO PASS A LANE, TRYING TO ENTER HIGHWAY, TRYING TO CLIMB A MILD HILL OR TRYING TO AVOID A POTENTIAL ACCIDENT. AFTER THE DELAY, THE TRANSMISSION WOULD DOWN SHIFT AND I THINK IT DOWN SHIFTS TO EITHER 1ST OR 2ND GEAR CAUSING THE SUV TO ROAR LIKE CRAZY AND SHOOTS OUT LIKE A CANNON. I HAD AN INCIDENT WHERE THE COPS GAVE ME A WARNING WITH THE LIGHTS AND SIREN PROBABLY THINKING THAT I WAS DRIVING RECKLESSLY. THERE WERE ALSO INCIDENTS WHERE I'VE HAD THE GAS PEDAL PRESSED DOWN ABOUT 80%-90% TRYING TO CLIMB A MILD ELEVATION AND EITHER THE ENGINE AND OR TRANSMISSION STARTED TO CHOKE. IT WAS SO BAD THAT THE DENALI ALMOST CAME TO A FULL STOP. YOU REALLY HAVE TO EXPERIENCE THIS ON YOUR OWN TO UNDERSTAND HOW SCARY AND NERVE WRECKING IT IS WHEN YOU HAVE VEHICLES ABOUT TO RAM YOU FROM BEHIND BECAUSE THE SUV SIMPLY WOULD NOT ACCELERATE.
