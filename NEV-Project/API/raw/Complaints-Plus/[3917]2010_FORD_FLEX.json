HERE ARE THE SPECIFICS OF WHAT HAPPENED:  WE HAD BEEN DRIVING FOR APPROXIMATELY 6 HOURS.  I WAS AT CRUISING SPEED OF 75 MPH.  AS I APPROACHED LUBBOCK TX, THE TEMPERATURE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON AND THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE HAD PEGGED ALL THE WAY TO 'HOT'.  I REDUCED SPEED AND DROVE TO THE NEXT EXIT (APPROXIMATELY 1-2 MIN AWAY). AS I EXITED THE FREEWAY, THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, AND MOMENTS LATER THE BATTERY LIGHT CAME ON.  AT THAT POINT, I LOST POWER STEERING AND THE ENGINE SHUT DOWN.  WE WERE ABLE TO PUSH THE CAR INTO A PARKING LOT ON THE FRONTAGE ROAD.    THIS INCIDENT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CLAIMS THAT HAVE LED TO THE SAFETY RECALL FOR OTHER FORD MODELS:ESCAPE SUVS FROM THE 2014 MODEL YEAR, PLUS THE 2014 AND 2015 COMPACT FIESTA ST, THE 2013 AND 2014 FUSION MIDSIZE CAR AND THE 2013 THROUGH 2015 TRANSIT CONNECT SMALL VAN (OBTAINED FROM USA TODAY, 1/3/2018).      MY INSURANCE WILL NOT COVER THE DAMAGE WHICH HAS RESULTED IN THE CAR BEING \"TOTALLED\".  THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM FOR FORD, AND I BELIEVE MY CAR SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED SAFETY RECALL.  THIS PROBLEM IN THE FORD FLEX HAS BEEN DISCUSSED FOR YEARS DATING BACK TO AT LEAST 2008 (HTTPS://WWW.FORDFLEX.NET/FORUMS/VIEWTOPIC.PHP?T=17392)",

TO DATE I HAVE NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN A COLLISION. HOWEVER IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS I HAVE HAD A FEW DISTRESSING CLOSE CALLS.  FORD MOTOR CO. WAS INITIALLY ALERTED OF THIS SITUATION BY PHONE IN APRIL 2010 WITH A CALL TO THEIR CONSUMER RESOLUTION CENTER.   MY REQUEST FOR HELP IS BEING IGNORED BY FORD MOTOR COMPANY. MY PHONE CALLS ARE NOT RETURNED, MY EMAILS ARE IGNORED, EVEN CERTIFIED MAIL IS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED.  IT HAS BEEN MY DESIRE TO WORK WITH FORD MOTOR COMPANY ON SOLVING THIS ISSUE BUT I HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL AVENUES. FORD REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY COMMUNICATIONS, FORD HAS BEEN ALERTED TO THIS PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE BUT HAS OBVIOUSLY CHOSEN TO DISREGARD IT.   I HOPE ALERTING THIS ORGANIZATION WILL GENERATE SOME ACTION BEFORE AN INJURY OCCURS.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",

        "summary": "I HAVE A 5-MONTH OLD, 2010 FORD FLEX LIMITED, AND I HAVE A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE AUTO REAR HATCH NOT BEING SAFE.  SPECIFICALLY, WHEN IN AUTOMATIC MODE-CLOSING, THE SAFETY REVERSE FEATURE IS NOT SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO REVERSE THE DOOR'S CLOSING APPROPRIATELY.  THE ONLY THING THAT GETS THE HATCH TO \"BOUNCE BACK\" OR REVERSE UP IS WHEN SOMETHING LIKE A STATIONARY AND HARD OBJECT (LIKE AN ADULT'S SHOULDER WHEN STANDING STILL) IS IN THE WAY.  LITERALLY, WHEN THE REAR HATCH IS LOWERING, YOU CAN GRAB IT AND TRY TO PULL IT BACK, AND IT DOES NOT STOP.  I HAVE TURNED OFF THE AUTOMATIC FEATURE BECAUSE I FEAR FOR MY OWN SAFETY AND THAT OF MY TWO BOYS -- 9 AND 12.  MY NEIGHBORS HAVE DIFFERENT VEHICLES WITH A SIMILAR AUTOMATIC REAR HATCH \"BOUNCE BACK\" FEATURE, AND WHEN I LOOKED AT HOW THEY FUNCTIONED, I REALIZED THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG.  THEY ALL STOPPED AND REVERSED DIRECTION AT ANY KIND OF BUMP.  WHEN I RAISED THIS ISSUE WITH THE DEALER, THEY TESTED IT AND COMPARED IT TO THE OTHER FLEXES ON THE LOT. THEY SAID THEY ALL WORKED THE SAME WAY.  BUT THAT MEANS THEY ALL ARE FLAWED THEN. I ASKED IF THEY COULD ADJUST THE SENSITIVITY OF THE BOUNCE BACK FEATURE, BUT THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT.  THAT ANSWER IS NO ANSWER WHEN I HAVE TO TURN OFF THE AUTOMATIC REAR HATCH FEATURE TO KEEP EVERYONE SAFE.  IT SHOULD BE MORE SENSITIVE TO OBJECT IN THE WAY, LIKE A HAND, FINGER, HEAD, ETC, AND REVERSE IMMEDIATELY UPON IMPACTING THE OBJECT. THE ONLY WAY I COULD GET IT TO STOP WAS TO STAND DIRECTLY UNDER IT AND HAVE IT COME DOWN ON MY SHOULDER AS I WAS STANDING STILL, AND THAT WAS A HARD PUSH DOWN ON MY SHOULDER.  THAT SCENARIO IS NOT REALISTIC. LITTLE HANDS (AND BIG ONES), AS WELL AS OTHER BODY PARTS, CAN GET IN THE WAY.  THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED SO I CAN ENJOY THE AUTO FEATURE I PAID FOR WITHOUT HURTING ANYONE. *TR",

WHEN TOWING HEAVY LOADS WITH THE MINI SPARE TIRE, VEHICLE HANDLING MAY BE DIMINISHED, WHICH COULD LEAD TO LOSS OF CONTROL, AND SERIOUS PERSONAL INJURY.\"  MY CAR IS NOT EQUIPPED WITH THE TIRE MOBILITY KIT, AND THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY TELLS ME, \"IF YOUR CAR IS EQUIPPED WITH A SPARE TIRE, IT WILL NOT BE EQUIPPED WITH THE TIRE MOBILITY KIT\".

IF BOTH BUCKLES OF THE CHILD SEAT ARE MANUFACTURED WITH THE NARROW PART FACING DOWN, THEN THE CLIPS WILL LATCH PROPERLY.

SO, IT IS THE \"HOOP\" PART OF THE ANCHOR THAT IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH.  NOTE:  WE HAVE SEVERAL BRITAX CHILD SEATS WHERE EACH SEAT'S BUCKLES ARE MOUNTED DIFFERENTLY ON THE SEAT ITSELF.

SHE TOOK IT TO THE DEALER THE SAME DAY AND THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT. THIS WAS ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND SINCE THEN IT HAS NOT HAPPENED AGAIN. I HOPE YOU HAVE BETTER LUCK WITH YOUR DEALER FINDING THE PROBLEM.     !@#$%!!!!!!!! IT HAPPENED TO ME TODAY!!!!!!!     I WAS ON MY WAY TO A MEETING THIS MORNING AND AS I WAS GOING INTO A CURVE THE CAR DIED!!! KAPUT! DEAD! NO BRAKES, NO POWER STEERING!!!!     THANK GOD THERE WAS NO ONCOMING TRAFFIC BECAUSE I WENT STRAIGHT INTO THE OTHER LANE. AND, THANK GOODNESS I HAD READ THIS POST A WHILE AGO SO I KNEW IMMEDIATELY WHAT HAD HAPPENED.     I TWISTED THE STEERING WHEEL HARD TO THE RIGHT AND ROLLED THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE STREET. PUT IT IN PARK AND RESTARTED IT. IT STARTED LIKE NOTHING.     I CALLED MY SA WHO OBVIOUSLY SUGGESTED I BRING THE CAR OVER RIGHT AWAY, WHICH I DID. I ALSO TOLD HIM ABOUT THIS POST AND RICHMONDFLEX'S NOTE ON THE TSB (THANKS BUD!). SINCE I HAD TO LEAVE THE CAR, I'M ALSO HAVING THEM LOOK AT THE BRAKE PROBLEM, WHICH IS BACK.     THAT WAS A SCARY MOMENT THIS MORNING!!!!     POST RE: FLEX DIED WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD  FRI JUN 12, 2009 3:23 PM  IN ANOTHER POST I THOUGHT OUR STEERING LOCKED UP, BUT AFTER TALKING TO MY WIFE, THE SAME STALL HAPPENED TO US (LONG STORY ON THE ACTUAL EVENT). TOTALLY FREAKED HER OUT TO THE POINT SHE WOULDN'T DRIVE THE CAR. I LOOKED UP ON LINE TO SEE IF THE CAR HAD ANY TSBS AND IT STATED WE DIDN'T. I STILL TOOK IT TO THE DEALER (NOT THE ONE WE BOUGHT IT FROM) AND HAD THEM LOOK IT UP AND LO AND BEHOLD THERE IT WAS. THEY SAY THE ISSUE OCCURS AT LESS THAN 10 MPH. THEY REPROGRAMMED THE COMPUTER (IT TOOK 45 MINUTES) AND SAID I SHOULD BE GOOD TO GO. FOR THOSE THAT JUST HAD IT HAPPEN OR HAVE YET TO HAVE IT HAPPEN, GO TO YOUR DEALER, IF NOTHING ELSE FOR THE PEACE OF MIND. MY CAR HAS 2K MILES ON IT. *TR",
