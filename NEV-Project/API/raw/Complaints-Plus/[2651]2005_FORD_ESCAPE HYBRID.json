I'd the seatbelt good enough in an accident, I am not trying to find that it either. The lights are a ticket every time and are another hazard to other motorist. The main wheel rust was told to me upon a failed inspection. It is not fixed at this point just found out and looking for recalls but found many with the same exact hazard. The warning lights go off every minute and a half while driving in the dashboard. This has been since I purchased the vehicle last year. The same goes for replacing the back running light. I don't know if the auto place was aware of these problems, but I'm positive the were just trying to move the vehicle if the lot at this point.

POWER TRAIN:AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION:GEAR POSITION INDICATION (PRNDL) Recall for 2005 Ford Escape Recall Announced SEPTEMBER 29 2015 NHTSA Reference #15V606000 If the shift lever disengages from the transmission, a driver may be unable to shift gear positions and the indicated shift position may not represent the gear position the vehicle is in. Should a disengagement occur while the vehicle is being driven, when the driver goes to stop and park the vehicle, the gear selection indicator may show that the transmission is in the \"PARK\" position, but the vehicle transmission may not actually be in the \"PARK\" gear position. If the vehicle is not in the \"PARK\" position there is a risk the vehicle will roll away as the driver and other occupants exit the vehicle or anytime thereafter.

I LEFT IT UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING AND IT STARTED RIGHT UP AND I DROVE IT HOME. I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT SCANXL AND USED MY LAPTOP TO SCAN THE CAR. I FOUND P1A10, P1A14, P0A0A, AND P0A95. IF I CAN BUY SOME CONSUMER PROGRAM AND FIND THIS INFO, WAY IS FORD TELLING THERE ARE NO CODES?

HE FEELS AS MY CAR IS ONE BECAUSE MY CAR HAS THE EXACT SAME SYMPTOMS AS THE RECALL.   IN THIS ARTICLE I HAVE HAD ALL OF THESE ISSUES.THE 2005 ESCAPE HAS PROBLEMS WHERE THE ENGINE SHUTS DOWN WHILE DRIVING. FORD FINALLY ISSUED A SEPTEMBER 2014 RECALL. TIME WILL TELL IF THE RECALL FIX REALLY SOLVES THE PROBLEM.  HOWEVER THE 2005 ESCAPE ALSO HAS A DEFECT WHERE THE PCM (POWER CONTROL MODULE) FRIES AT AROUND 100K MILES. FORD EXTENDED THE PCM WARRANTY TO 80,000 MILES, BUT ONLY AFTER MOST OWNERS WERE PAST THE MILEAGE LIMIT. NOW OWNERS ARE ON THE HOOK FOR THE AVERAGE REPAIR COST OF OVER $2,000 (!!)",

AND THAT \"EVEN IF ONE OF THE BODY SHOPS IN TOWN WOULD WORK ON IT, IT WOULDN'T BE UNTIL AT THE EARLIEST NOVEMBER\". HE THEN SMIRKED AT ME, AND SAID \"SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO\"? WELL. HERE WE ARE.  THIS WAS JULY 25, 2016. I WAS TOLD THAT THE VEHICLE IS UNDRIVEABLE, AND THAT IF I WERE IN AN ACCIDENT, THAT MY INSURANCE WOULDN'T COVER IT BECAUSE OF THE SHOCK TOWER COMING UP THROUGH THE INSIDE OF THE CAR ( THAT STARTED JULY 22, THE DAY I STOPPED DRIVING IT, EXCEPT TO DRIVE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP) THAT I NOW KNEW ABOUT BUT CANNOT FIX.",

I BOUGHT FROM THE ORIGINAL OWNER, A FAMILY MEMBER, WITH ONLY 55K MILEAGE OVER THEIR 10 YEARS OF OWNERSHIP (THEY WERE UPGRADING). I DROVE THE CAR AN ADDITIONAL 1,500 MILES HERE (TO 56K, TOTAL) OVER MY FIRST TWO MONTHS OF OWNERSHIP, AND THE CAR HAD PASSED ALL ITS REGULAR ANNUAL INSPECTIONS. SUDDENLY ONE NIGHT ON THE ROAD THE CAR'S ENGINE BEGAN CHUGGING WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO TRAVEL BEYOND 45MPH, AND A BLINKING YELLOW CHECK ENGINE LIGHT APPEARED. UPON RESTARTING THAT INDICATOR DID NOT COME BACK ON, BUT THE ENGINE WAS STILL SLUGGISH AND SO I ATTEMPTED TO COAST HOME AT MANAGED SPEEDS (AS I WAS ONLY A MILE AWAY) TO HAVE A MECHANIC CHECK IT OUT DURING BUSINESS HOURS. I DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT HOME. THE ENGINE LIGHT WENT ON FULL AND I SOON LOST POWER COMPLETELY, WITH BARELY ENOUGH NOTICE TO PULL OFF THE 6 LANE HIGHWAY. THE SUDDEN POWER LOSS SEEMED VERY UNSAFE AS I HAD TO STEER MANUALLY WITH NO POWER STEERING NOR ACCELERATION. AFTER THE CAR STALLED OUT IT WOULD NOT EVEN RESTART FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. I TOWED IT TO A MECHANIC THE NEXT DAY AND THEY READ ME A LONG LIST OF ERROR CODES THAT HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED, ALL OF WHICH WENT BACK TO THE POWER CONTROL MODULE (PCM) FAILURE, APPARENTLY, AS DESCRIBED IN TSB 10-18-10. I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY TWO DIFFERENT MECHANICS, INCLUDING MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP, THAT IT WOULD COST AT LEAST $2,000 TO SERVICE THE PCM AND REPLACE ALL AFFECTED SPARK PLUGS, COILS AND CYLINDERS.    DESPITE THE VERY LOW MILEAGE BELOW THE 80K PCM WARRANTY, THE VEHICLE REACTED RATHER SPORADICALLY AND UNPREDICTABLY AND IT CREATED AN UNSAFE CONDITION. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE BEEN INFORMED SOONER OF THIS KNOWN ISSUE. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL NOTICE SINCE THE PCM IS KNOWN TO CAUSE A HAZARD. I NOW SEE THAT THERE ARE 113 COMPLAINTS LOGGED AT CARCOMPLAINTS.COM, CITING SIMILAR PCM AND/OR ENGINE PROBLEMS.  *TR",

THEY SAID THEY COULD TRY TO REPROGRAM IT, BUT IT COULD TAKE UP TO 10 HOURS AND MAY NOT WORK. FORD SAID THE LAST PROBLEM THEY SAW LIKE THIS DIDN'T WORK AND THE OWNER HAD TO TRADE IN FOR A NEW CAR! NOT ONLY COULD THIS INCIDENT HAVE SERIOUSLY HARMED MY FAMILY, BUT NOW I'M OUT OF A CAR AND $2,000!",

ABOUT 1 WEEK AFTER THIS PROBLEM, THE SERVICE EMISSION LIGHT CAME ON. I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK THE DAY THE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE CAR COMPLETELY STOPPED ON THE HIGHWAY, IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC.

I GOT TO THE SIDE AND PUT MY CAR INTO PARK, TURNED THE ENGINE OFF, AND WAITED A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO ALLOW MY HEART RATE TO COME BACK DOWN TO A NORMAL PACE. I TURNED THE KEY AND THE ENGINE TURNED BACK ON. I DROVE IT INTO AN AUTO SHOP TO SEE WHAT THE ISSUE WAS, AND THE READER SHOWED CYLINDER 2 MISFIRE. THE FIRST POSSIBLE FIX WAS TO REPLACE THE COIL ON PLUG, WHICH IS WHAT I DID. I GOT HOME TODAY AND AM STILL EXPERIENCING THIS SCARY FEELING OF MY CAR NOT BEING ABLE TO EXCEL ABOVE 60.

I WENT TO OUR LOCAL BODY SHOP TO GET  HIS RECOMMENDATION. HE SAID, THEY HAD JUST DONE ONE, IN 10/2014 FOR JUST UNDER $900 AND HE GOT THE PART FROM MY \"FRIENDS\" AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR $120.

AFTER A FEW DAYS THE BANGING GOT LOUDER AND MY ESCAPE SEEMED TO BE HITTING HARD IN THE BACK LIKE MY SHOCK WASN'T WORKING. WHICH MY HUSBAND HAD CHANGED THEM ABOUT 3 OR 4 MONTHS PRIOR SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS ODD. AFTER DRIVING HER TODAY AND THE BANGING GETTING WORSE I HAD MY HUSBAND LOOK AT MY BACK FENDER WALL. WHEN WE DID WE SEEN IT COMPLETELY RUSTED OUT. I CAN TOUCH THE INSIDE OF MY CAR. BUT THE WORST PART OF THIS IS THAT IS WHAT HOLDS MY SHOCK IN PLACE AND IT IS ALL GONE. I CAME INSIDE FRUSTRATED AND DECIDED I WOULD SEE IF THERE ARE PARTS TO FIX IT BEFORE MY SHOCK DECIDES IT IS GOING TO GO FOR A FREE RIDE AND DESTROY EVERYTHING UNDER THERE. TO MY SURPRISE I HAVE NOT FOUND A FIX NOR A RECALL BUT I DID FIND NUMEROUS PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE. THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE. I AM VERY SURPRISED THAT NO ONE HAS MADE FORD RECALL THE ESCAPES AND FIX THIS ISSUE. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF I WAS ON THE FREEWAY GOING 70 MPH WHEN THIS BROKE AND THE DAMAGE IT COULD DO TO NOT ONLY MY ESCAPE BUT MY FAMILY, MYSELF, AND OTHER DRIVERS IF I LOST CONTROL OF IT BECAUSE MY SHOCK IS NO LONGER ATTACHED TO MY SUV? I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN FORD AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT IS IN CHARGE OF RECALLING VEHICLES. THEY HAVE PUT MY FAMILY, ME, AND ALL THE OTHER DRIVERS ON THE ROAD IN DANGER AND NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE. MAYBE I SHOULD BUY A TOYOTA BECAUSE AT LEAST THEY RECALL THEIR VEHICLES AND FIX THEM WHEN THEY HAVE AN ISSUE. FORD DOES NOT SEEM TO CARE ABOUT ANYONE'S SAFETY.  *TR",

THEN EXPERIENCED MULTIPLE BUT RANDOM \"LIMP HOME MODE\" EVENTS, PARTICULARLY WHEN STOPPING AT LIGHTS OR ACCELERATING (LIGHT-MOD PRESSURE) FROM A FULL STOP.  CAR WOULD FLASH \"SERVICE ENGINE SOON\" AND NOT GO ABOVE 20MPH AND SOMETIMES NOT THAT.  WOULD PULL OFF IF ABLE, OTHERWISE, WOULD HAVE TO STOP WITH FLASHERS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, TURN OFF THE ENGINE, WAIT A MINUTE, AND THEN RESTART (REBOOTING CAR).  THIS WOULD CLEAR THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND CAR WOULD RESUME NORMAL OPERATION - OF NOTE:  CODES WOULD NOT STAY IN THE HISTORY OF THE COMPUTER.

WE STOPPED SHORTLY AFTER WE FELT AND HEARD SOMETHING THAT WAS CLEARLY ABNORMAL AND A MECHANIC TOLD US THE CAR WAS SO RUSTED IN THAT WHEEL WELL THAT THE TOP OF THE SHOCK HAD NOTHING TO HOLD TO.  WE WERE ON A LONG TRIP, SO WE HAD THE SHOCK CUT OUT UNTIL WE GOT HOME.  NONE OF THE OTHER UNDERBODY AREAS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT RUST, ACCORDING TO THE MECHANICS WE CONSULTED, SO WE SUBSEQUENTLY PAID SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS TO HAVE A NEW WHEEL WELL FABRICATED AND INSTALLED ALONG WITH NEW REAR SHOCKS ON BOTH SIDES.      WE SEE NO RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM BUT ON THE WEB WE QUICKLY FOUND SEVERAL OWNERS OF THE SAME MODEL CAR DESCRIBING THE SAME PROBLEM - THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR WHEEL WELL RUSTING OUT.   HOW CAN THIS NOT BE A DESIGN ISSUE?  CERTAINLY IT'S SIGNIFICANT A SAFETY ISSUE, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE AREA OF SEVERE RUST WAS NOT APPARENT FROM LOOKING AT THE CAR.     NOW THE DRIVER SIDE IS SHOWING SIGNIFICANT EXTERIOR RUST AT THE LIP OF THE WHEEL WELL, SO WE WILL BE SENDING IT IN TO HAVE OUR MECHANIC SEE IF THE SAME PROBLEM IS HAPPENING ON THE REAR DRIVER SIDE.

SERVICE TECHNICIAN REMOVED INTERIOR COVERING TO FURTHER INSPECT DAMAGE, AND DISCOVERED THE SHOCK ABSORBER WAS STICKING UP INTO THE VEHICLE.  SERVICE TECHNICIAN REFERRED VEHICLE TO THEIR (FORD DEALERSHIP) BODY SHOP, WHO'S TECHNICIAN INFORMED ME THAT THE SUB-FRAME IS RUSTED OUT AND WOULD COST AT LEAST $6000 TO REPAIR.  I DECLINED THEIR REPAIR OFFER, AND BROUGHT THE VEHICLE HOME.

THEY INFORMED ME THAT THIS WAS COMMON ON 05 AND 06 FORD ESCAPES AND THEY HAD REPAIRED QUITE A FEW FOR THE SAME THING. THEY ALSO INFORMED ME THAT FORD RECENTLY HAD A RECALL FOR 01-04 FORD ESCAPES FOR A SIMILAR ISSUE ONLY ON THE FRONT OF THE CAR. THEY THOUGHT THAT FORD SHOULD DO A RECALL ON 05-06 FOR THE BACK. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WILL HELP TO HAVE A RECALL DONE BUT WHAT THE WELDING SHOP WAS TELLING ME SEEMS TO BE TRUE AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET. I WILL KEEP ALL OF MY RECEIPTS AND THE PICTURES THAT I TOOK AND HOPE A RECALL IS EVENTUALLY DONE.

I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE AND WONDER IF FIXED IF IT WILL BE SAFE TO DRIVE.

I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE NEAREST FORD DEALERSHIP AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A FAILURE WITH THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM THAT HAD TO BE RESET (SHUTDOWN WAS TO PROTECT THE HYBRID BATTERY).  ONCE FORD FIXED THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM TO GET CAR TO START AGAIN, THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR SHOCK ABSORBER HAD FULLY DETACHED FROM THE WHEEL HOUSE AND WAS BASICALLY A DANGLING PIECE.  FORD COULD OFFER NO HELP \"THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT OR CAPABILITY TO FIX\" AND SAID I HAD TO GO TO A AUTO BODY SHOP TO HAVE THE PIECE WELDED BACK TO THE FRAME.  TURNS OUT THERE IS NOTHING THERE TO WELD, THE ENTIRE CONNECTION HAS ROTTED OUT AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.  FROM WHAT I CAN FIND ONLINE THIS IS A RECURRING ISSUE ON 2005 FORD ESCAPES AND FORD REFUSES TO DEAL WITH IT.  CARS WITH THESE ISSUES ARE EXTREMELY UNSAFE TO DRIVE.  LUCKILY I WAS NOT INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT WHEN THIS HAPPENED BUT I WAS ONLY DRIVING 35MPH ON A SIDE STREET, IMAGINE WHAT COULD'VE HAPPENED IF I WAS TRAVELING AT 70MPH ON THE HIGHWAY AND THE PIECE JUST FELL OUT.  THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FIX THAT FORD OWNERS SHOULD NOT HAVE THE BURDEN OF DEALING WITH FINANCIALLY ON A CAR THAT IS LESS THAT 10 YEARS OLD.  MY CAR IS VERY WELL MAINTAINED AND HAS A LOT OF LIFE LEFT IN IT, BUT NOW THIS FIX IS GOING TO COST CLOSE TO $2500.  THIS SHOULD BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED SO FORD HAS TO FIX THIS SAFETY ISSUE!

I JUST PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE ON OCTOBER 15TH OF 2013. I HAVE NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF SUCH A PROBLEM BEFORE. I DID RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET ONLY TO FIND NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SAME PROBLEM.  I TRIED ORDERING THE PART FROM A FORD DEALER AND THEY SAY IT IS ON BACK ORDER. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE PART FROM FORD SO THE MAZDA TRIBUTE IS THE SAME SO I AM ORDERING THE PART FROM THEM. THIS IS MY ONLY VEHICLE SO I HAVE TO HAVE IT RUNNING  . I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE SINCE DECEMBER 17TH, 2013. I HAVE TO TAKE IT TO AN AUTOBODY SHOP TO HAVE THIS WORK DONE. I SURELY HOPE THIS PART WORKS BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T I CAN NOT AFFORD TO BUY ANOTHER VEHICLE. I HAVE CALLED FORD AND THEY SAID THERE ARE NO RECALLS ON MY VEHICLE, AND I ALSO WENT TO THERE RECALL WEBSITE TO CHECK FOR MYSELF AND COULD NOT FIND ANY LISTED. I AM GOING TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY BUT IT IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO DO ANY GOOD. SOMEONE NEEDS TO FILE CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT AGAINST THEM BUT THEN ONLY THE LAWYERS WIN. PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS PROBLEM WHICH SEEMS TO BE A REGULAR OCCURRENCE ACCORDING TO ALL THE COMPLAINTS.  *TR",

YOU GOT TO DROP THE TANK. THE NEW CORRECT PART COSTS $300, AND THE LABOR IS ABOUT $500.

I HAVE PERSONALLY WITNESSED THIS SEVERAL TIMES...WITH GAS OVERFLOWING   OTHER PEOPLES CARS.      THIS IS WHY PEOPLE MUST REMAIN AT THE CAR WHILE FILLING IT...THESE AUTOMATIC NOZZLES FAIL ALL THE TIME.    THIS FUEL FILLING SYSTEM ISSUE IS A POTENTIALLY SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM,  CONSUMERS MUST NOT BE REQUIRED TO RELY ON OTHER SAFETY SYSTEMS, BECAUSE THOSE SYSTEMS WILL FAIL.      FORD DESIGNED A DEFECTIVE FUEL FILLER SYSTEM, AND NHTSA MUST MAKE FORD FIX THEM, AT FORD'S EXPENSE'    IF NHTSA IS UNWILLING TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM UNREASONABLE RISK...THEN WHAT GOOD ARE THEY?    ANYTHING THAT POTENTIALLY INVOLVES CONSUMERS GETTING SPLASHED WITH GASOLINE IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD    PERIOD.    *TR",

TWO DAYS LATER WHEN I GOT IN MY CAR TO LEAVE, THE GAS PEDAL WAS COMPLETELY STUCK LIKE THERE WAS AN INVISIBLE ROCK UNDER THE PEDAL.  MY FRIEND FOLLOWED THE GAS PEDAL CABLE UNDER THE HOOD AND REMOVED THE BLACK COVER AND UN-FROZE (UN-STUCK)  THE END OF THE CABLE SO I CAN AT LEAST GET THE CAR BACK HOME.  I WAS UP-NORTH AT THAT TIME AND VERY SCARED DRIVING THE CAR HOME BECAUSE WHAT IF THIS HAPPENS WHEN I'M GOING AT A FREEWAY SPEED.    I PROMPTLY LEASED A NEW CAR BECAUSE THESE TWO ISSUES SCARED THE HECK OUT OF ME.  I STILL HAVE THE CAR BUT WOULD LIKE IT TO GET REPAIRED.     I CONTACTED FORD HQS ON 10/25/2013 TO COMMUNICATE THE ISSUES I EXPERIENCED AND TO ASSIST IN RESOLUTION AS I DO KNOW THERE WERE RE-CALLS ON OTHER ESCAPES WITH THE SAME ISSUE.  THEY STATED MY CAR WAS NOT ONE OF THE CARS UNDER RE-CALL FOR THIS ISSUE.  I FURTHER EXPRESSED THAT THE CAR SHOULD AS THERE ARE MANY OTHERS WITH A 2005 ESCAPE WITH THE SAME COMPLAINTS AS I RESEARCHED THE WEB.  SHE STATED IF THERE IS A RECALL IN THE FUTURE I WOULD RECEIVE A LETTER IN THE MAIL.  I ASKED IS THERE ANYONE ELSE I COULD ACCELERATE THIS ISSUE TO AND SHE STATED MY ISSUE IS DOCUMENTED IN THE SYSTEM.  THE REPAIR FOR THIS ISSUE IS VERY EXPENSIVE. WHY IS THE RE-CALL NOT COVERED ON 2005 ESCAPES BUT ON 2004 ESCAPES?  MY 2005 ESCAPE WAS ACTUALLY BUILT IN 2004.    ACCORDING TO FORD HQS, MY VIN# DOES NOT COME UP FOR THE RE-CALL!!!  CAN YOU HELP ME OUT ON THIS AND FOR OTHERS WITH THE SAME ISSUE? JUST SEARCH THE WEB AND YOU WILL SEE MANY PEOPLE WITH THE SAME COMPLAINTS AND DANGERS OF THIS.  THANK YOU.  *TR",

CAME BACK WITH 2 CODES U2023 AND C1234. WHICH MEANS THE RIGHT FRONT TONE RING IS BAD. AFTER SEARCHING THE INTERNET, I FOUND THIS TO BE A VERY COMMON PROBLEM.  ALSO GOT UNDER THE TRUCK AND SURE ENOUGH THE TONE RING IS CRACKED AND SPINNING AROUND LOOSELY. THE SAFETY ISSUE HERE IS THE ABS WILL LOCK UP RANDOMLY ON DRY CEMENT WHEN YOU START TO APPLY YOUR BRAKES.

I CANT BELIEVE THAT THIS YEAR AND MODEL WASN'T RECALLED - ACCORDING TO THOMPSONS, THERE IS A BACK ORDER FOR THE COMPUTER MODULE FOR THIS CAR, TWO WEEKS MINIMUM DUE TO SO MANY ESCAPES 2005 NEEDING THIS SAME COMPUTER BECAUSE IT WAS SHORTED OUT PREMATURELY AND UNSAFELY.   IT NEVER HAPPENS WHEN YOU DRIVE LESS THAN 50 SO THIS IS STRANGE AND VERY DANGEROUS.I WOULD LIKE FORD TO REPAY US THE DAMAGES AND COSTS THAT US CUSTOMERS, HAVE DISHED OUT RECURRING EVERY 2-3 YEARS.  COILS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE REPLACED THAT MANY TIMES NOR SHOULD THE PLUGS AND ABSOLUTELY NOT THE COMPUTER.  PLEASE  LOOK INTO THIS AND MAKE FORD DO A RECALL AND RETROACTIVE SINCE THEY ALREADY HAVE SO MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SAME PROBLEM BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO OR REFUSE TO DO A MASS RECALL.  *TR",

FORTUNATELY, I WAS DRIVING IN THE RIGHT LANE AND WAS APPROACHING A TRAFFIC LIGHT. MANAGED TO TURN RIGHT AT THE INTERSECTION TO GET OUT OF HEAVY FLOW OF TRAFFIC. WAS ABLE TO START THE CAR AGAIN BUT THE RUMBLING CONTINUED AND THE CAR HAD NO PICK UP. TOOK VEHICLE TO MY MECHANIC. MACHINE INDICATED A AND C COILS WERE BAD. REPLACED A AND C COILS, PROBLEM STILL. MECHANIC SAID IT MIGHT BE THE COMPUTER BUT SAID TAKE CAR TO FORD DEALER FOR DIAGNOSTIC CHECK TO BE SURE. TOOK CAR TO A FORD SERVICE DEPT. FOR DIAGNOSTIC. WAS TOLD THAT THE PROBLEM WAS IN THE A AND C COILS AND PLUGS. WHEN I SAID I ALREADY HAD THOSE REPLACED, HE IMMEDIATELY SAID \"THEN THOSE PARTS MUST BE BAD AND/OR THE WIRES ARE BAD AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO TRACE ALL WIRES TO FIND BAD ONES AND REPLACE THEM\". THE ESTIMATED COST FOR THE REPAIR $1100. I ASKED IF THE PROBLEM COULD BE THE COMPUTER. SERVICE REP SAID, \"OH, NO COMPUTER IS NOT THE PROBLEM\". PAID $100 FOR DIAGNOSTIC CHECK. TOOK CAR BACK TO MY MECHANIC, HE TRACED ALL THE WIRES AND DID NOT FIND A SINGLE BAD WIRE. ACCORDING TO MY MECHANIC, THE ONLY OTHER THING IT COULD BE, BASED ON THE WAY THE CAR IS ACTING, IS THE COMPUTER. I PRICED A COMPUTER. IT COSTS ABOUT $495. SO THE QUOTE FROM THE DEALERSHIP NOW MAKES MORE SENSE CONSIDERING THAT THE COST OF THE COMPUTER IS ABOUT HALF OF THE $1100 THEY SAID IT WOULD COST TO TRACE WIRES AND REPLACE PLUGS AND COILS. SO BASED ON THE FORD SERVICE DEPT DIAGNOSIS, CONVERSATION AND QUOTE, FORD KNOWS THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH THE 2005 FORD ESCAPES. MY DAUGHTER AND I COULD HAVE BEEN SEVERELY INJURED OR KILLED BECAUSE THE CAR STOPPED SUDDENLY WHILE WE WERE MOVING AT 50 MPH. THIS IS A MANUFACTURE/ASSEMBLY DEFECT THAT SHOULD BE RECALLED. *TR",

I AM GOING TO QUOTE DIRECTLY FROM THE DIAGNOSTIC REPORT I RECEIVED.  \"SOME ESCAPE/MARINER VEHICLES BUILT ON OR BEFORE 10/3/2005 , EQUIPPED WITH A 3.0L ENGINE MAY EXHIBIT A MALFUNCTION INDICATOR LAMP (MIL) ON WITH TWO OR MORE DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODES (DTC'S) FOR COIL ON PLUG (COP) PRIMARY CIRCUIT FAULTS (P0351-P0356).  THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE COP AND POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE (PCM) REACTING TO RADIO FREQUENCY INTERFERENCE FROM THE SPARK PLUGS.\"  MY REPAIR TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH VEHICLES LIKE MINE.  AFTER SEARCHING THE WEB, I FOUND ONE PERSON WHOSE ESCAPE DIED WHILE ON THE INTERSTATE AND DURING HEAVY TRAFFIC AND PLENTY OF OTHERS WITH SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES.  I SUPPOSE I WAS LUCKY BECAUSE MY PROBLEM HAPPENED IN A PARKING LOT.  I HAD TO REPLACE MY POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE AND ALL SIX COILS AT A COST OF OVER $1200.  I SAVED LABOR COSTS BY DOING THE WORK MYSELF, BUT OTHERS I READ ABOUT DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME FATE.  MY TECHNICIAN ALSO TOLD ME THEY HAVE SEEN THIS PROBLEM NUMEROUS TIMES AND THAT I SHOULD SAVE MY RECEIPTS BECAUSE FORD MAY ISSUE A RECALL.  MY VEHICLE WENT FROM RUNNING PERFECTLY TO NOT RUNNING AT ALL WITHOUT ANY WARNING.  I HAD TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION IN THIS SAME VEHICLE AT ONLY 37000 MILES, BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY.

AS THE FREEWAY BEGAN TO RISE, MY CAR SLOWED DOWN EVEN MORE.  I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO ROLL BACKWARD.  I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO DIE AND KILL OTHERS.  IT WAS A NIGHTMARE.  I  HAD TO FEVERISHLY PUMP THE GAS PEDAL TO GET IT TO THE DEALERSHIP.  TODAY (8/4/11) THEY CALLED TO TELL ME THAT THE THROTTLE BODY HAD GONE BAD.  I LOOKED IT UP ONLINE, AND IT'S NOT A PART THAT 'GOES BAD'...BUT IT DOES REQUIRE CLEANING.  UNFORTUNATELY MAINTENANCE OF THE THROTTLE BODY IS NOT A PART OF FORD'S MAINTENANCE PROTOCOL.  I READ MANY OTHER HARROWING STORIES OF PEOPLE WHO HAD NEAR MISSES BECAUSE OF THROTTLE BODY MALFUNCTION.  AT LEAST A COUPLE OF PEOPLE EVEN HAD WRECKS.  EVENTUALLY SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET KILLED.  I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WAS SUCH A PART IN A CAR...I AM NOT A MECHANIC, BUT IF I PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE, I DO EXPECT A MECHANIC TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM!  IT WAS HORRIBLE AND VERY FRIGHTENING.  I'M JUST GLAD THAT I DIDN'T HURT ANYONE.  FORD NEEDS TO REALIZE THAT THIS PROBLEM WILL EVENTUALLY RESULT IN A FATALITY.  I HAVE COMPLAINED TO THE FORD MOTOR CO. COMPLAINT LINE, SO HOPEFULLY THEY WILL LISTEN TO US.  *TR",

REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT I PUT THE FLAMES OUT EARLY AND I AS A MAINTENANCE OFFICER WITH 24 YEARS EXPERIENCE I COULD HAVE FIXED THE CAR, I WANTED MY WIFE TO HAVE A NEW CAR SO WHEN I LEAVE HER BEHIND FOR MY NEXT DUTY STATION IN THE MARINE CORPS AND DEPLOY, I WOULD NOT HAVE ANY WORRIES.

I HATE TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD I NOT BEEN ABLE TO REACT AS FAST AS I DID AS THE VAN BEHIND ME HAD TO SLAM ON HIS BREAKS TO KEEP FROM HITTING ME. ONCE THE SEMI TRUCK WAS CLEARED OF THE RIGHT LANE I GOT OVER AND TURNED ON MY FLASHERS. SINCE I HAD IT RUNNING I WAS TOO SCARED TO PULL OVER ON THE SIDE. I GOT TO MY NEAREST EXIT AND PULLED OVER. I TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE AND ALL THE WARNING LIGHTS WENT OFF EXCEPT THE ABS AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT. I RESTARTED AND DROVE ABOUT A MILE TO A MECHANIC. THEY COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING WRONG BUT HEARD THE MISFIRE. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO CLASSIC FORD IN COLUMBIA, SC. I HAD TO RENT A CAR TO FINISH MY TRIP AS I COULDN'T LET DOWN A COUPLE ABOUT TO BE MARRIED.  I JUST GOT THE ESTIMATE TO THE TUNE OF OVER $2700.00. IT'S THE PCM MODULE ALONG WITH COIL, SPARK PLUGS AND A FEW OTHER THINGS. I AM NOW DEBATING ABOUT WEATHER TO FIX IT OR NOT AS ALL THE REVIEWS I HAVE READ IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO HAVE PROBLEMS AFTER IT'S FIXED. IT SOUNDS LIKE FORD REALLY NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO FIX THIS CHRONIC PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE DIES IN AN ACCIDENT.",

SINCE AUGUST 23RD MY VEHICLE HAS BEEN UNSAFE TO OPERATE WITHOUT THIS PART AS MY TURN SIGNALS, HEAD LIGHTS, AND HAZARD LIGHTS ARE INOPERABLE, AS WELL AS POWER WINDOWS, INTERIOR AND DASH LIGHTS, POWER LOCKS, RADIO AND CLOCK DISPLAY AND MY ABILITY TO UNLATCH THE REAR DOOR. AFTER RESEARCHING THE INFORMATION MYSELF I WAS FORCED TO WAIT ANOTHER WEEK TO BE SCHEDULED TO HAVE MY VEHICLE SCHEDULED FOR REPAIR. ON SEPT. 7TH THE FORD MECHANIC CONFIRMED THE PART I TOLD HIM I NEEDED WAS CORRECT AND SAID PART WAS ON BACK ORDER AND SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN TWO WEEKS. ON SEPT.21ST, I CALLED TO ASK IF THE PART WAS AVAILABLE.  IT WAS THEN THAT THE MECHANIC SAID THAT HE NEGLECTED TO MENTION THE PART WOULD NOT BE ORDERED UNLESS I PAID IN ADVANCE.  I PAID FOR THE PART ON SEPT23. ON SEPT. 29TH THE GENERAL MANAGER AT WORDEN-MARTIN CALLED TO SAY THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO. I ASKED IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO HAVE A USED PART PUT IN TEMPORARILY WHILE I WAIT. I RECEIVED A REPLY THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY $350 TO HAVE THAT PART PUT IN WITH NO GUARANTEE THAT THE PART WOULD FUNCTION PROPERLY AND NO COMPENSATION IF THE REPLACEMENT PART WERE TO FAIL. NOT WANTING TO THROW AWAY $350 FOR A FAULTY PART, I FELT I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO WAIT ANOTHER WEEK FOR THE PART TO ARRIVE. AFTER WAITING TWO WEEKS I NEVER RECEIVED A CALL, SO I CALLED THE DEALER TO INQUIRE ON THE PART.  I WAS TOLD THE PART MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL OCT. 25TH. I CALLED FORD MOTOR COMPANY'S CUSTOMER SERVICE WHO TOLD ME IT WAS THEIR DISTRIBUTOR AND NOT FORD'S RESPONSIBILITY AND THE PART SHOULD BE AVAILABLE BE AVAILABLE OCT. 15TH BECAUSE THE PART, ORDERED BY MANY, WAS BEING REDESIGNED. ON OCT. 19TH I CALLED AGAIN AND WAS TOLD THE PART MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL NOVEMBER. *TR",

I IMMEDIATELY PULLED TO THE CURB AND THE CAR LOST ALL POWER AND STEERING LOCKED UP. THE CAR RESTARTED AND I TOOK IT TO FORD.

I GOT TO THE FIRST INTERSECTION TO WHERE WHEN IT WAS MY TIME TO GO THE PEDAL WAS HARD.  I HAD TO COAST THROUGH IT AND PULL OVER.

I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER AND HE INFORMED ME THAT THE CABLE AND THE FOOT PEDAL VACUUM WERE NO LONGER OPERATING (5L8Z-2C053-BA AND YL8Z-19048-AA) AS WAS THE CASE THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND THAT HE HAD TO WAIT FOR A NEW PART IN ORDER TO REPLACE THESE DEFECTIVE PARTS.  I ASKED WHY THIS HAD HAPPENED AGAIN, AND WHAT I WAS TOLD HORRIFIED ME.    THE MANUFACTURER MOST LIKELY HAD NOT RESOLVED THE PROBLEM OF THE PAST AND THAT THE PROBLEM WAS IN THE PARTS.  I ASKED WHY THERE WAS NOT A MORE LIFE SAFETY SOLUTION TO THIS VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM AND I WAS TOLD THAT SINCE THIS DID NOT HAPPEN OFTEN IT WAS NOT DEEMED A REAL ISSUE.    THE RATIONALE IS APPALLING.  HOW AM I EXPECTED TO BE SAFE WITH THIS VEHICLE WHEN THE CONDITION IS NOT RESOLVED IT IS JUST PROLONGED, WITH FAILURE LOOMING OVER ME?  HOW DO I DRIVE MY CHILD AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN A VEHICLE THAT CAN STOP OPERATING AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT??     MY COMPLAINT IS IN REGARD TO LIFE SAFETY AND VALUE OF RECIPROCITY.       SINCE THERE IS NO DEATH AS OF YET, I MUST WAIT FOR THE FAILURE? THIS IS EMOTIONALLY STRESSFUL.  *TR",

AT NO TIME HAS CONTINENTAL EXPRESSED ANY INTEREST IN VIEWING THE SEPARATED TIRE. IN SHORT,  $20.00 TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE FORD DEALER SOLD ME A SET OF DIFFERENT TIRES AT HIS COST JUST SO THAT WE COULD HAVE SOME PEACE OF MIND WHILE DRIVING IN THE FUTURE.

WHEN I BOUGHT IT (BRAND NEW) I NOTICED AN AIR BAG ISSUE WHERE DURING DRIVING, IF THE PASSENGER MADE A SLIGHT SITTING ADJUSTMENT, THE AIRBAG WOULD DEACTIVATE. SOMETIMES IT WOULD NOT REACTIVATE, OR TAKE A LONG TIME (5, 10 MINUTES). I TOLD FORD ABOUT IT, AND THEY REPLACED THE AIRBAGS SEAT GEL PAD SENSOR.  THE SYMPTOM IMPROVED, BUT STILL HAPPENS. MY FIANCE IS 120LBS AND SHE SITS NORMALLY IN HER SEAT. IF SHE MAKES A MOVE TO READJUST (AS ONE WOULD ON A ROAD TRIP, OR LONG DRIVE) THE AIRBAG MAY STILL DEACTIVATE. INITIALLY IT WAS FREQUENT (75% OF THE TIME) HOWEVER NOW IT IS 50/50 (SINCE THE REPLACED GEL PAD).  HOWEVER, IT IS TROUBLING TO KNOW THAT WHEN I AM DRIVING, SOMETIMES MY FIANCEE''S AIRBAG IS DEACTIVATED. WE FEEL VULNERABLE THAT THE SAFETY ITEMS WE PURCHASED TO PROTECT US ARE NOT ALWAYS THERE FOR US.    I TRIED COMMUNICATING WITH FORD TELLING THEM IT STILL PERSISTS, BUT THEY JUST DON'T \"GET IT\". I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN A PASSENGER SITS IN THE SEAT AND THE CAR KNOWS IT - HOW CAN THE CAR DEACTIVATE THAT AIRBAG WHILE WE ARE DRIVING 60 MPH? THAT SEEMS LIKE A DESIGN FLAW - AS OBVIOUSLY THE PASSENGER CANNOT EXIT THE VEHICLE WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION, OR EVEN BEFORE THE DOOR OPENS.    IN MY OPINION, IF THE CAR SENSES A PASSENGER WHEN STARTING TO MOVE, THEN THE AIRBAG SHOULD STAY ON - AT LEAST UNTIL IT STOPS MOVING (COMES TO A COMPLETE STOP). SO *MOTION* WOULD BE A CHECK POINT AND NON-MOTION WOULD BE ANOTHER POINT TO *REEVALUATE* - BUT DEFINITELY NOT IN THE MIDDLE OF FREEWAY DRIVING...  I HOPE PEOPLE APPRECIATE THE GRANDEUR OF THE SITUATION WHERE THE AIRBAG PURPOSELY DEACTIVATES (FROM INCORRECT EVENT PROGRAMMING) WHILE DRIVING. ALSO, THE BELOW INCIDENT DATE IS IRRELEVANT.  *JB",

THE LIGHT INDICATING THAT THE AIRBAG HAS TURNED OFF COMES ON  EVEN WHEN I AM SITTING IN THE SEAT AND I WEIGH OVER 120 LBS.

THE COMPANY HAS EVEN CALLED OUT AN ENGINEER FROM FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND HE SEEN THE PROBLEM HAPPEN WHEN SOMEONE WAS SITTING IN THE SEAT. HOWEVER THEY CAN NOT FIGURE OUT WHY IT IS DOING THIS BECAUSE THE FACTORY TESTS THAT THEY RUN ARE SOWING THAT THE CAR IS WORKING PROPERLY. IT IS OBVIOUS TO EVERYONE THAT THIS IS NOT TRUE BECAUSE THE LIGHT COMES ON AS SOON AS I SIT IN THE SEAT. THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD PUT ME INTO ANOTHER CAR AND TAKE BACK THE ESCAPE. I CHOSE A 2005 FORD FREESTAR. WHICH HAS THE SAME SAFETY FEATURE BUT IT WORKS WHEN I AM IN THE SEAT.

I DO NOT KNOW WHAT MY RIGHTS ARE IN THIS CASE. THEY WANT US TO RETURN THE VAN AND I AM REALLY UPSET BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT I HAVE TOP TAKE BACK THE ESCAPE WHICH IS THE VERY CAR THAT I AM NOT SAFE IN.

THERE WAS AN OBSTRUCTION IN MY DRIVEWAY SO I PUT THE CAR INTO DRIVE AND PULLED 1/2 WAY INTO THE GARAGE TO CLEAR THE WAY.  I PUT THE CAR IN PARK, OPENED MY DOOR, TOOK OFF MY SEATBELT AND GOT OUT OF MY CAR WALKING TOWARDS THE REAR.  SUDDENLY THE CAR ACCELERATED IN REVERSE KNOCKING ME DOWN BECAUSE OF THE OPEN DOOR.  I JUMPED INTO THE CAR (WHERE MY CHILDREN WERE IN THE BACK SEAT) TO PLACE THE CAR IN PARK-IT WAS IN PARK AND ROLLING FAST.  I USED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO STOP THE VEHICLE WITH THE HELP OF THE OPEN DOOR JAMMING ALONG SIDE THE GARAGE WALL.  THE END RESULT WAS SHOULDER AND COLLAR BONE DAMAGE AS WELL AS SEVER BODY DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE OPEN DOOR.  IF THE DOOR HAD NOT BEEN OPEN, MY CHILDREN WOULD HAVE ROLLED INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND BEEN HIT HEAD ON.  I AM POSITIVE SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS NEW CAR, YET THE GALPIN VAN NUYS FORD DEALERSHIP HAS REFUSED TO INSPECT IT FOR SAFETY.  THEY INSISTED THAT I FIRST FILE A CLAIM WITH MY INSURANCE CARRIER, WHICH I DID AND STILL HAVE BEEN REFUSED THE SAFETY INSPECTION BY FORD AND THE DEALERSHIP LEVEL AND THE CORPORATE LEVEL.  I WANT TO ENSURE I AM DRIVING A SAFE CAR AND THIS PROBLEM WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.*AK",
