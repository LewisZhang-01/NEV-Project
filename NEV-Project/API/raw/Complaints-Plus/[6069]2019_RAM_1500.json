They are going to replace the fuel pump mid to end of February due to part shortage. My wife was on the entry roadway to I95 when without warning the truck puttered and died on the entrance ramp. There was no warning lights, messages etc. Luckily she puttered to the side out of the way of speeding cars getting on I95. According to the dealership they have no idea how the fuel pump died. The dealership is the only party that inspected the vehicle. 2) The second problem we are having  with the Ram, is the dashboard lights flicker on off for no particular reason. It just happens when it feels like it. We brought it to the dealership and of course it didn\u2019t happen to them so they have no idea why the dashboard lights are going on and off. The rear defroster isn\u2019t working. The battery died as well. We feel there is some type of electrical problem with the truck.  We do not believe a vehicle with only 40,000 miles would have the fuel pump die. I know other Ram trims (2500, 3500 etc)have had recalls due to fuel pumps dying and dashboard lights going on and off for no reason. I think this is a problem that needs attention!

In about 150 miles into the trip started smelling diesel, pulled over on a narrow 2 lane road couldn\u2019t see anything. So my wife found a road we could pull off on to check everything out a mile away, right before we made it to the road a (service electronic throttle) message came on, so made it to the road to pull off stoped and instantly smoke started bellowing out from the back of the hood. I hopped out and started feeling something burning my legs looked down and saw liquid aluminum dripping and yelled from everyone to get out, by to time we got everyone out the whole front of the truck way fully on the so I got what I could get out and my wife was on the phone with 911. Knowing that the fire department is 20 minutes out I needed to save the camper. Fire is past the fire wall now, pull the panel for the emergency release to put the transmission in neutral one of the airbags blew up in my face and couldn\u2019t get it out of park. So somehow I shook the truck and camper enough to get the pin out of the hitch and somehow someone drove by and asked them could they help me pull the camper away, and we hooked a chain and pulled it away. 24 minutes later the fire department arrived and everything I saved from the truck was in the grass and burned up to hot to get close to get. So 24 minutes of hell was just starting legs, hand burned and contacts burned can\u2019t see well and back thumping. Calling everyone like Ram, insurance company no one will help. So the volunteer fire department pulled are camper to their fire station and stayed the night there until are family could pull us back home.

I started researching and located multiple forums that stated this was a known issue. I also spoke to a mechanic that stated this was not normal on a vehicle with under 60,000 miles. I was also told that if it separates it could cause an accident and possibly result in injury or death. My question is why has a recall not been made with this being a known issue. This vehicle I purchased new from this same dealer and had never been off road. I don\u2019t understand the integrity of the design for a vehicle that is four wheel drive and should be built to perform off-road having this issue with no off road activity ever taking place.

        "summary": "I have had radio issues since Mid 2020 on my 2019 Ram 1500 Laramie Longhorn.  I have gone to the dealer and they have updated the software. It was good for a short, SHORT, time and then the issue continued.  At the end of November of 2020, my battery went bad for a second time. I took it in to the dealer because the radio was not working again and this time they ordered a new radio. The maps system would show my 250 miles to the East Southeast. I live in Wichita, KS and it would have me in a field outside of Tulsa, OK.  The radio would display also the same message that \u201cdive not supported\u201d.  I finally got a replacement radio and the maps worked but the display immediately went back to \u201cdevice not supported.\u201d I went back into the dealership and they contacted Mopar once again and the service person told me that an update was coming in the spring of 2021.   I have contacted the dealership and \u201cUS Customer Care | uscustomercare@fcagroup.com\" by the installed help system multiple times and I have received one replay but was told at each phone contact that someone would be contacting me to followup. No one has ever returned a call for a follow-up.  I would like my radio back and to be able to use it like it was purchased to function. It is a distraction to use since it also controls the air conditioning and the heat functions as well as hands-free for my phone.  Please look into this matter and PLEASE keep me updated on it. It is a hazard and needs to be repaired properly",

        "summary": "Based on the inspections and investigation arranged by the insurance group (attended by the vehicle and braking system manufacturers), a \u201cseized caliper\u201d was the cause of a 2019 incident that nearly killed a family traveling from Illinois to Florida.  A 2019 DODGE RAM was rented from Enterprise Rent-a-car (Illinois), for the purpose of transporting a family (and their personal belongings) to their new home in Florida.  8 hours into the trip, the truck was traveling 65-70 mph on I-65 South when smoke began emanating from the rear, drivers side tire area.  The driver pulled to the side of the road to inspect the issue, and immediately spotted flames near the drivers side, rear tire.  The flames were directly beneath the fuel tank, leading the family to abandon the vehicle.  911 was called and the county fire department arrived approximately 20 minutes later.  The vehicle was fully engulfed in flames, and was a total loss.  Fortunately, no one was (physically) hurt.  Kentucky State Police also attended the incident, transporting the family to a local DQ for them to wait for their replacement rental vehicle to be delivered. This incident occurred on May 31, 2019.  Disappointing is the best way to describe how Dodge and Bosch have handled this incident.  Ilco, the insurance group acting on behalf of Enterprise Rent-a-car, completed a thorough inspection process, which suggested that a seized caliper was the cause of the incident.  The family involved were verbally notified on the findings.  End of story",

AT LOW SPEED (<5MPH) AND WITH THE BRAKE FULLY APPLIED,  THE TRUCK HIT A STOPPED MINIVAN IN FRONT OF ME AND CONTINUE PUSHING IT TOWARDS THE INTERSECTION IN BURSTS AS I WAS DEPRESSING THE BRAKE PEDAL.

ONCE YOU GO BELOW 60 THE MALFUNCTION WILL NOT DUPLICATE.     THIS VEHICLE HAS HAD ALL REQUIRED RECALL REPAIRS FOR GROUND CABLE PRIOR TO PURCHASE.

I GOT  ON INTERSTATE 10 HERE IN HOUSTON, I WAS IN THE RIGHT LANE AND THE MOTOR VEHICLES BEHIND ME  WERE TWO BIG RIGS MOVING AT A GOOD SPEED. I NEEDED TO GET TO THE LEFT LANE FOR EASY PASS.  TO GET OUT OF THE TRUCKERS WAY I \"PUT MY PEDAL TO THE METAL\" AS THE PHRASE GOES. I FELT I BELIEVE IT WAS THREE CRUNCHES UNDER MY RIGHT FOOT. RIGHT AT THIS TIME MY GAS PEDAL WENT BACK AND HIT THE FIRE-WALL CARPET.WAS DRIVING IN MY 3 MONTH OLD RAM 1500 WITH 1840 MILES ON IT.  ACCELERATED TO GET ON THE HIGHWAY, PRESSED THE PEDAL AND IT CLICKED LIKE GEARS WERE BREAKING.  I COULD FEEL IT UNDER MY SHOE.  THE PEDAL GOT STUCK AND I WAS REALLY ACCELERATING, I HIT THE BRAKE HARD AND IT SLOWED THE CAR.  I GOT MY SHOE BEHIND THE PEDAL UP HIGH AND PULLED IT TOWARD ME.  THE DASH LIT UP \"A!\"  SERVICE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE CONTROLLER!    I MOVED THE PEDALS TOWARD ME LIKE A SHORT PERSON WOULD DRIVE.  THE ENTIRE PEDAL WOBBLES LIKE ITS BROKEN INSIDE THE UNIT.   I PUT A CALL INTO SOMEONE AT THE DEALERSHIP. ON THE FOLLOWING  DAY, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 21ST. I BROUGHT MY TRUCK IN TO THE DEALER. THEY JACKED INTO THE OBD CONNECTOR AND A MINUTE LATER IT SHOUT OUT 6-7 ISSUES. THEY GAVE ME A LOANER CAR AND SAID THIS WOULD TAKE A FEW DAYS TO SORT. I GOT A CALL ABOUT TWO HOURS LATER TELLING ME THAT A NEW THROTTLE CONTROLLER HAD TO BE ORDERED AND THAT WOULD TAKE ABOUT A WEEK TO GET. THEY ALSO SAID THEY COMPARED MY PEDAL WITH A NEW TRUCK AND THAT THERE WAS AN PROBLEM. I'M HOPING FOR A CALL BACK.  THIS IS SERIOUS!

I WENT TO THE DEALER 5 TIMES SINCE THIS PROBLEM APPEARS. THEY SAID THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD, THEY GAVE ME 2 REPORTS, AND THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T DUPLICATE THIS PROBLEM, SO THEY REFUSE TO EXCHANGE OR RETURN THIS PROBLEM CAR.     I FELT VERY VERY UNSAFE TO DRIVE THIS CAR.   THE DEALER TOLD ME \"IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE BECAUSE NOTHING SHOWS ON THE PANEL, NO WARNING LIGHT.\"  BUT I THINK BECAUSE OF NOTHING SHOWS ON THE PANEL IS THE SCARIEST PART.   IT IS A NEW CAR. I WAS DRIVING ON THE NICE AND FLAT ROAD. I DIDN'T TURN THE RADIO OR AC ON. I TURN OFF THE INSIDE AIR CIRCULATION.  I CLOSED ALL THE WINDOWS WITHOUT A GAP. EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL AND IT STARTS HUMMING.  I HAVE DRIVE TRUCK/PK TRUCK FOR 35 YEARS, AND IT IS THE FIRST TIME OF MY LIFE HERD A CAR MAKING SUCH A NOISE. A CAR IS HAVING A PROBLEM AND SHOWS ANY WARNING LIGHT, EVEN A PROFESSIONAL CAN'T SOLVE?  WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? IS THE TIRE GOING FELL OFF WHEN I'M DRIVING?  IS THE CAR GOING TO CONSTANTLY STOP ON THE HIGHWAY? IS THE BREAK NOT GOING TO DO ITS WORK WITHOUT A WARNING? I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS, AND WHO KNOWS WHAT THE ANSWER IS.  I'M SO DONE WITH THIS CAR.    I HAVE A LOT OF VIDEOS RECORDED WHEN THE HUMMING HAPPENS, BUT ALL OF THEM ARE BIGGER THAN SIZE 5MB. I WONDER IF THERE ANY OTHER WAY TO SHOW THE EVIDENCE. I CAN DO EMAIL TO THE AGENT.",
