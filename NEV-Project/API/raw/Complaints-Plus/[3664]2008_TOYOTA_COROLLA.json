NOW THE SAME PROBLEM IS OCCURRING. I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN IN MY CAR OVER NIGHT.  I STOPPED AT A STORE, TURN OFF THE CAR WENT INSIDE FOR 10 MIN. THIS WAS AROUND 6:00 PM  CAME BACK OUT CAR WOULD NOT START UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING AROUND 8:15 AM. I SLEPT IN MY CAR SO I DID NOT HAVE TO LEAVE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD OR IN A PARKING LOT!  EVERYONE SEEMS TO IGNORE WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE. THIS IS REPETITIVE FOR THIS CAR.  YOU ALREADY HAVE A A COMPLAINT FROM A PERSON DATED 2010 WHERE HIS ECM HAD TO BE REPLACED TWO TO THREE TIMES AND HE IS STILL UNHAPPY.  AT LEAST MY CAR HAS GONE A LITTLE LONGER THAN HIS HAD.  I DO NOT HAVE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS TO PAY FOR CONTINUING TO FIGHT WHAT IS ALREADY IN BLACK AND WHITE AT TOYOTA.  HELP ME GET THIS CAR FIXED AT THEIR COST.  IF THIS WAS NOT A REPEATING ISSUE, I WOULD GLADLY PAY FOR IT, BUT IT IS REPETITIVE!!!!!!  THIS IS AN ON GOING THING AND STARTED ABOUT A U=YEAR AGO. MY CASE NUMBER WITH TOYOTA USA IS:  1709051915 WHERE I TALKED WITH THEM ABOUT THIS AT THE FIRST OF SEPTEMBER.  THEY SAY ONCE A RECALL IS COMPLETE THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO. THE PROBLEM I AM HAVING IS HIGHLIGHTED ON THE ATTACHMENT DATED 10/3/2011",

THEN THE MOTOR BEGAN TO RACE AS IF SOMEONE HAD FLOORED THE ACCELERATOR AND WAS HOLDING IT THERE.  AS MY FOOT REMAINED ON THE BRAKE, WHICH FORTUNATELY HELD, I LOOKED AROUND TO SEE IF ANYONE WAS WITNESSING THE EVENT SO I WOULD HAVE SOMEONE TO BACK ME UP, BUT NO ONE WAS NEAR.  IT STOPPED RACING AFTER A FEW SECONDS, THEN ABRUPTLY STARTING RACING AGAIN FOR A FEW SECONDS.  ALL THIS TIME I WAS IN REVERSE AND HAD MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE.  THEN IT SUDDENLY STOPPED.  I PUT IT INTO PARK FOR A WHILE TO SEE WHAT IT WAS GOING TO DO, BUT WHEN NOTHING HAPPENED I WENT INTO REVERSE AGAIN AND THE ENGINE DID NOT RACE.   THE SECOND OCCURRENCE WAS IN THE FIRST PART OF JUNE WHEN I HAD JUST GONE ABOUT 1/8 OF A MILE AND THE CAR WAS STILL COLD.  IT WAS A WARM, DRY DAY.  I WAS SITTING AT A LIGHT WAITING TO GET ON THE BELTLINE WHEN I HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A MOTORCYCLE NEARBY RACING ITS ENGINE.  MY RADIO WAS ON PLAYING MUSIC.  I  HEARD IT FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN IT STOPPED.  I LOOKED AROUND FOR THE MOTORCYCLE.  THEN IT STARTED AGAIN.  BY THIS TIME I REALIZED THAT IT WAS MY ENGINE THAT WAS RACING.  BY THE TIME I CUT THE RADIO OFF, IT HAD AGAIN STOPPED.  SO THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME THE SUA HAPPENED WHEN THE ENGINE WAS RELATIVELY COLD AND WITH TWO SHORT EPISODES OF THE RACING ENGINE.  I  DID NOT THINK TO LOOK AT THE TACHOMETER.  IT WAS TOO QUICK.  AGAIN, MY FOOT NEVER LEFT THE BRAKE.  WHEN THE LIGHT CHANGED I DROVE ON THROUGH THE TRAFFIC WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.

AFTER DRIVING IT FOR SEVERAL WEEKS, I REALIZED THERE WAS SOMETHING TROUBLING  ABOUT THE ACCELERATOR. WHENEVER I DEPRESSED THE ACCELERATOR TO MAKE A STANDING START -- WHEN A TRAFFIC SIGNAL TURNED GREEN, FOR EXAMPLE -- THE CAR WOULD OFTEN LURCH FORWARD IN AN UNCONTROLLABLE MANNER. I SOON TRACED THE PROBLEM TO THE POSITION OF MY FOOT ON THE ACCELERATOR. IF MY FOOT WAS IN JUST THE RIGHT POSITION -- LOW TO MIDWAY ON THE PEDAL, WITH MY HEEL CLOSEST TO THE FLOOR -- I HAD COMPLETE CONTROL. BUT IF I MISCALCULATED AND PLACED MY FOOT EVER SO SLIGHTLY HIGHER ON THE PEDAL, THE CAR WOULD LURCH FORWARD EVEN WHEN I APPLIED THE SAME PRESSURE. I COULD REGAIN CONTROL ONLY BY QUICKLY TAKING MY FOOT OFF THE ACCELERATOR AND/OR HITTING THE BRAKES. THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP THAT MAINTAINS MY CAR REPEATEDLY SAID I SHOULD NOT WORRY -- THAT AS THE CAR'S COMPUTER GOT USED TO MY DRIVING HABITS, IT WOULD EVENTUALLY ADJUST THE ACTION OF THE ACCELERATOR TO MY TOUCH.  BUT NOTHING CHANGED. NOW I TAKE EXTRA CARE TO TRY AND GET MY FOOT IN JUST THE RIGHT SPOT BEFORE ACCELERATING FROM A STANDING START. SOMETIMES I AM SUCCESSFUL, OTHER TIMES NOT. IN ANTICIPATION OF TROUBLE,  I MAKE IT A POINT TO LEAVE PLENTY OF EXTRA SPACE BETWEEN ME AND THE CAR AHEAD OF ME, SO I WON'T REAR END IT IF THE ACCELERATOR SENDS ME LURCHING FORWARD.  I HAVE BECOME RESIGNED TO THE PROBLEM, BECAUSE I AM A TOYOTA FAN AND LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT THE CAR.   I NEVER THOUGHT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS UNTIL A NEW YORK TIMES STORY INDICATED THAT OTHER TOYOTA OWNERS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM, AND (I BELIEVE) HAD NOTIFIED YOUR AGENCY.
