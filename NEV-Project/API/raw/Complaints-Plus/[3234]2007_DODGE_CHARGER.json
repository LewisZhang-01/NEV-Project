GOT A READING AT 2 DIFFERENT AUTO ZONES,  AND GOT A TUNE UP, OIL CHANGE, AND WIRE COILS THAT GO WITH THE CAR. STILL THE SAME PROBLEM.

SO, AFTER I GET MY SLOW CAR OUT THE IMPOUND, I LOOKED ON CARS.COM AND I SEE A PREVIOUS RECALL ON MY CAR THAT I DIDN'T SEE AT THE TIME OR PURCHASE OR HAD ANY IDEA OF, THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE TO LATE TO FIX EVEN THOUGH THESE THE EXACT SAME PROBLEMS I'M HAVING AT THIS PRESENT MOMENT.

I POPPED THE HOOD AND FOUND SOME SHATTERED PLASTIC PIECES. UPON MY 1ST INSPECTIONS MY FAN WAS WHAT SHATTERED. I MADE A FEW CALLS AND WHEN A MECHANIC CAME TO INSPECT 20 MINUTES LATER, HE SAID THE FAN EXPLODED CAUSING PIECES TO THEN HIT THE RADIATOR. NOW BOTH PARTS NEED TO BE REPLACED. NOW INVESTIGATION, I SEE THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR CHARGERS AND I'M WONDERING WHY THERE ISN'T A RECALL. I CANT EVEN IMAGINE WHAT COULD'VE HAPPENED IF I WAS DRIVING. I ALSO HAD MY CHILD IN THE CAR. SCARY ENOUGH WHILE THE CAR WASN'T MOVING. TIS HAPPENED OUT OF THE BLUE WITH NO PRIOR WARNINGS.",

ALL 4 OF MY TIRES HAD CRACKED AROUND THE SHOULDER OF THE TIRES, AND THE CRACKING WAS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TIRE THAT I HAVE NO VISION OF. THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE NEVER KNOWN IF I HADN'T TAKEN MY VEHICLE IN TO BE SERVICED. I HAVE ONLY PUT A LITTLE OVER 20,000 MILES ON THESE TIRES AND THE TREADING IS GREAT WHICH DOESN'T SHOW ANY SIGNS OF NEGLECT. THE PLACE I PURCHASED THE TIRES FROM AGREED THAT THE TIRES ARE IN GREAT CONDITION, & THE TIRES HAD THE CORRECT PRESSURE IN THE ETC. THEY ALSO SAID THAT I'M NOT THE FIRST PERSON THAT HAS COME IN WITH THE SAME ISSUE WITH NEXEN ROADIAN HP TIRES. THEY SENT ALL OF THE PAPERWORK IN TO THE MANUFACTURER AND THEY ARE THE WORST. BERNARDO WAS VERY RUDE AND TRYING TO PUT BLAME ON THE CUSTOMER (ME) WHEN HE WAS CLEARLY TOLD BY THE PLACE I PURCHASED THE TIRES FROM WHICH ARE THE SAME ONE'S THAT TOOK PICTURES OF THE TIRES AND DID THE INSPECTION THAT THEY SEE ABSOLUTELY NO FAULT OF MINE AND THAT THE TIRES ARE JUST DEFECTIVE. SO THEN I ASKED FOR THE DOT NUMBERS, AND WHAT DO WE DISCOVER??? THE MANUFACTURING DATE WAS STAMPED 4715, HOW COULD THIS BE IF I PURCHASED THE TIRES IN JULY 2015? THERE IS SOMETHING SHADY GOING ON AND NEXEN NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED, MY CAR HAS BEEN AT MCCARTHY TIRE FOR 2 WEEKS AND NOW THAT THE DOT ISSUE HAS BEEN DISCOVERED NO ONE HAS AN ANSWER TO WHY IT'S STAMPED FOR THE 47TH WEEK OF 2015, IT'S ONLY 52 WEEKS IN A YEAR WHICH MEANS I WOULD'VE HAD TO BY THOSE TIRES IN NOVEMBER 2015. THE REVIEWS I'M READING ON NEXEN TIRES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME ISSUE THAT I'M HAVING, WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE BEFORE A RECALL IS DONE ON NEXEN TIRES?",

I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE CAR TO A MECHANIC AND THEY REPLACED THE FAN BLADE AND THE RADIATOR. THREE WEEKS LATER THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO THE FAN BLADE ON THE DRIVER SIDE OF THE CAR, ONCE AGAIN MAKING A HOLE IN MY NEW RADIATOR. I FEEL THAT THIS IS A HUGE DESIGN FLAW AND, APPARENTLY, A HUGE PROBLEM WITH 2006-2008 CHARGERS. I'M SO GLAD I WAS IN TOWN ON SMALL LOCAL STREETS BOTH TIMES WHEN THIS HAPPENED. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE IF IT HAD HAPPENED ON THE FREEWAY.  I CHECKED WITH THE DEALER TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY KIND OF RECALL FOR THIS PART AND THERE ISN'T.

I CAN PUT IT IN PARK & THEN BACK IN GEAR AND IT MOVES, BUT BARELY. IT ISN'T CONSISTENT BUT IT IS TERRIFYING. I HAVE GOOGLED POSSIBLE ISSUES AND IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM AND THEY HAVE LINKED IT TO A BAD PCM. I TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC BUT OF COURSE IT DIDN'T DO IT WHILE HE HAD IT.

WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AND ON BUSY STREETS, MY CAR WILL SHUT OFF, BUT IT WILL START RIGHT BACK UP. THIS IS A DANGEROUS HAZARD AND SAFETY CONCERN. I'VE TAKEN MY CAR TO THE GRESHAM DODGE (ON NE BURNSIDE) DEALERSHIP TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE (503-666-2277). I WAS TOLD \"IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN, BRING IT BACK\" THERE WAS NO CONCERN WITH DODGE THAT THEY WERE SENDING A DANGEROUS VEHICLE BACK OUT ON THE ROAD, THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. THIS WAS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED NOW, NOT LATER. DODGE NEVER SOLVED THAT ISSUE. FURTHERMORE, MY CAR WAS STUCK IN THE PARK POSITION ON THE EVE OF 4-18-16. I TRIED TO GET IT INTO GEAR, WITHOUT ANY SUCCESS. I HAD TO CALL FOR A TOW TRUCK. WHILE WAITING FOR A TOW, I DECIDED TO GOOGLE DODGE CHARGERS STUCK IN PARK. ON YOUTUBE, THERE WERE SO MANY OTHERS WITH THE SAME ISSUE. THEY HAD VIDEO OF HOW TO GET THE CAR OUT OF PARK. YOU HAD TO PRY THE COVERING OFF OF THE SHIFTING UNIT. STICK A PEN INSIDE TO MOVE A WIRE AROUND, IN ORDER TO GET THE CAR INTO GEAR. IT WORRIES ME THAT DODGE IS AWARE OF TRANSMISSION ISSUES AND OTHER ISSUES WITH THEIR VEHICLES, YET NOTHING IS BEING DONE TO FIX IT. I COULD OF SERIOUSLY BEEN HURT OR SERIOUSLY HURT SOMEONE ELSE WHILE BEING ON THE FREEWAY AND MY CAR JUST SHUTTING OFF. THEY SHOULD BE CONCERNED ENOUGH TO WANT TO LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE AND FIX IT. AS I STATED BEFORE, THERE ARE NUMEROUS VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE WITH OTHER PEOPLE EXPERIENCING THE VERY SAME ISSUES. I DID FILE A COMPLAINT ON THE BBB WEBSITE, ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE. MY MAIN OBJECTIVE FOR THIS SITE IS TO BRING OUT HOW DANGEROUS IT IS TO OPERATE MY CAR UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, THAT DODGE DID NOT SEEM TO CARE ABOUT.

I CONTACTED DODGE/CHRYSLER AND WAS TOLD THAT MY 2007 DODGE CHARGER IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL THOUGH THE ISSUE IS EXACTLY THE SAME AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT IT WOULD NEED TO BE REPAIRED AT MY COST AND THEN IF MY VEHICLE IS LATER INCLUDED IN A RECALL, I WOULD BE REIMBURSED.  I'VE READ OF MANY DODGE OWNERS EXPERIENCING THIS SAME ISSUE WHERE THEY HAVE THE EXACT ISSUE BUT ARE EXCLUDED WITHIN THE RECALL YEARS.  THIS NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED AS THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCOPE IS NOT CAPTURING THE COMPLETE SPECTRUM.  HOW DO WE GET INCLUDED INTO THE RECALL?  IF DODGE/CHRYSLER WILL NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS, ESPECIALLY FOR A SIMPLE PLASTIC PART THAT BREAKS, THEN I CERTAINLY DON'T FORESEE MYSELF EVER BUYING ANOTHER DODGE/CHRYSLER.

A FEW MINUTES LATER IT CAME ON AGAIN AND PUFF OF WHITE SMOKE CAME OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD AND THE MOTOR SEIZED. FROM THE RESEARCH I HAVE DONE ON THE INTERNET I HAVE FOUND THAT THE 2.7 LITER DODGE/CHRYSLER MOTOR HAS HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH OIL SLUDGE ISSUES THAT WOULD CAUSE THE ENGINE TO SEIZE. SO FAR CHRYSLER HAS NOT TAKEN ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE 2.7L ENGINE.  THE BOTTOM END OF THE MOTOR HAS TO BE REBUILT OR REPLACED TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM. AT THIS POINT THE WARRANTY COMPANY IS BLAMING ME FOR THE MECHANICAL FAILURE OF THE OIL FILTER SEAL ON THE ENGINE.  *TR",

THE ENTIRE FRONT OF MY CAR TO THE DASH WAS COMPLETELY MELTED WITHIN 5 MINUTES OF THE CAR EXPLODING.

APPARENTLY IF YOU LIVE OR ARE GOING TO DRIVE ON A GRAVEL ROAD YOU CAN'T OWN A CHARGER. BOTH THE DEALER AND CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE TURNED THIS DOWN AS A WARRANTY ITEM. DEALER STATED ROTORS NEEDED TO BE TURNED BUT WITHOUT GIVING ME A SOLUTION AS TO PREVENTING THIS PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE. THE GROOVES IN THE ROTOR ARE ABOUT 1/8 OF AN INCH. THIS WOULD TAKE ABOUT 40 ROCKS PERFECTLY LINED UP ON EACH OF THE REAR BRAKES. IMPOSSIBLE. I AM BE GIVEN THE RUN AROUND AND WOULD APPRECIATE ANY ASSISTANCE POSSIBLE. *JB",

I HAVE  COMPLAINED TO THE LOCAL DEALER IN MY AREA AS TO THE PROBLEM AND A POSSIBLE PERMANENT FIX WITH TSB 05-001-07. THE DEALER HAS STATED I'VE BEEN DECLINED FOR THIS TSB AND ALL THAT CAN BE DONE UNDER WARRANTY IS A TEMPORARY FIX OF REPLACING THE BRAKE PADS WITH THE SAME LIKENESS AND RE-CUT THE ROTORS. THIS SHOULD NOT EVEN BE AN OPTION FOR A BRAND NEW VEHICLE WITH ONLY 3500 CAREFULL MILES. THE MANUFACTUER IS FULLY AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM IN THEIR BRAKING SYSTEMS AND HAS DONE NOTHING TO CORRECT THIS, THAT I AM AWARE OF. AS I STATED, TSB 05-001-07 WAS DENIED FOR MY VEHICLE DUE TO A \"SALES CODE\" THAT DOES NOT MATCH. MY VEHICLE HAS THIS HEAVY DUTY BRAKE SYSTEM STATED IN THE TSB, BUT DO TO \"LIABILITY\" WILL NOT BE DONE. I HAVE CONTACTED SEVERAL VEHICLE OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS I HAVE, AND ALL ARE JUST AS FRUSTRATED AS I AM TO HAVE A NEW VEHICLE WITH BRAKE PROBLEMS.  THE DEALER THEN STATED TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE MANUFACTURER AND HOPE SOMETHING \"COMES OUT\" BEFORE THE 12,000 MILE WARRANTY IS UP. THANK YOU!",
