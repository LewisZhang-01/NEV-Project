IT WAS THE NUMBER 3 CYLINDER. THE CONNECTING ROD BEARING WAS BAD. I CLEANED THE JOURNAL ON THE CRANKSHAFT AND MEASURED IT WITH PLASTIGAUGE. IT WAS 0.001\" OVER THE TOLERANCE. I INSTALLED NEW BEARING ON ALL FOUR RODS IN HOPES THAT 0.001\" OUT OF TOLERANCE WOULDN'T BE TO MUCH. EVERY BEARING ON THE ROD SIDE WAS WORN OUT AND THE COATING GONE.

I CHECKED THE THE TIRE PRESSURE IN EACH OF THE 4 TIRES WITH A ANALOG AND DIGITAL TIRE PRESSURE METER AND THE PRESSURE IN EACH TIRE WAS ABOUT 32 PSI. I RE- INFLATED EACH TIRE UP TO 36 PSI (SPEC REQUIREMENT) BUT THE WARNING LIGHT STAYED ON. I NOTIFIED HYUNDAI HEADQUARTERS CUSTOMER SERVICE ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND THEY ASSIGNED A CASE NUMBER AND SUGGESTED I TAKE THE NEW AUTO WITH ONLY ABOUT 1500 MILES ON ODOMETER TO SAN TAN HYUNDAI. I HAD TO WAIT ABOUT 2 WEEKS FOR A OCT.18,2018 APPOINTMENT. THE TIRE WARNING LIGHT TURNED OFF JUST BEFORE MY APPOINTMENT, SO I CANCELED THE APPOINTMENT. ON 12-18-2018 THE TIRE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON AND STAYED ON AFTER THE 4 TIRES WERE RE-INFLATED AGAIN FROM 32 PSI UP TO 39 PSI.

I HAVE MADE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT WITH SAN TAN HYUNDAI BUT WHAT I HERE FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE IS: IT MAY COST YOU DOLLARS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM INSTEAD OF INDICATING THAT IT IS COVERED UNDER MY NEW CAR WARRANTY.
