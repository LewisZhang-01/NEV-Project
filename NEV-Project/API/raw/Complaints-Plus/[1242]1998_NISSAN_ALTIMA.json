        "summary": "DURING CROSS-COUNTRY TRIP, VEHICLE BEGAN EMITTING METALLIC WHINING NOISE AND CLICKING IN ENGINE COMPARTMENT, NOT AUDIBLE FROM PASSENGER COMPARTMENT. WHEN I RETURNED HOME, I PERFORMED REGULAR TUNE-UP MAINTENANCE, CHECKED MY VALVE CLEARANCES AND TIMING ADJUSTMENTS.  SHORTLY AFTER I STARTED MY VEHICLE AGAIN, MY LOWER TIMING CHAIN SNAPPED. AFTER A LENGTHY DISASSEMBLY, I DISCOVERED THAT A PIECE OF BLACK PLASTIC FROM A CHAIN GUIDE HAD BROKEN AWAY AND FUSED WITH THE CHAIN, CAUSING IT TO SEIZE AND BREAK. ALSO, THE LOWER CHAIN TENSIONER HAD BEEN COMPLETELY EATEN THROUGH BY THE CHAIN (NOT AS A RESULT OF POOR SERVICING; I CHANGED MY OIL EVERY 3000 MILES AND CHECKED/TOPPED IT OFF EVERY 2 WEEKS) THE INCIDENT CAUSED $600 IN PARTS DAMAGE, AND COULD EASILY HAVE COST $1500 IN LABOR AT A MECHANIC OR DEALERSHIP.  THE CHAIN BREAKAGE DESTROYED MY OIL PUMP, CRANKSHAFT SPROCKET, LOWER CHAIN COVER, LOWER CHAIN TENSIONER, GUIDE (BEYOND ORIGINAL BREAKAGE) AND OIL PAN BAFFLE / SUMP TUBE.  SINCE NISSAN HAD INITIATED A \"TSB\" BEFORE I EVER PURCHASED MY ALTIMA, NO COMPENSATION WAS EVEN CONSIDERED. OBVIOUSLY THE TSB PROCESS DOES NOT INCLUDE CHECKING VEHICLES AS THEY ARE BROUGHT IN FOR MAINTENANCE, AS I HAD REGULARLY HAD MY CAR SERVICED BY THE DEALERSHIP FOR A FULL YEAR POST-PURCHASE.  I REPLACED THE DEFECTIVE CHAIN GUIDE WITH THE UPGRADED NISSAN COMPONENT, A METAL-BACKED GUIDE TRACK, AND SHALL SOON INSPECT MY TIMING AGAIN TO ENSURE THAT THE REPAIRS PERFORMED INDEED CORRECTED THE PROBLEM.  TWO RECOMMENDATIONS: FIRST, THE TSB PROCESS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED, AS IT OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT EFFECTIVELY SAFEGUARD CONSUMERS AGAINST ENGINEERING BLUNDERS SUCH AS THIS; SECOND, AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR QUALITY OF PRODUCT IN TERMS OF MECHANICAL SOUNDNESS AS WELL AS SAFETY. IF STATE CORPORATION COMMISSIONS CAN REGULATE SERVICE QUALITY AND PRICING FOR EVERY SERVICE AGENCY IN THEIR SPHERE, I THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE THE SAME LEVERAGE OVER AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS. *JB",

THE REPAIR SHOP GUESSED MY PROBLEM BEFORE EXAMINING THE CAR, STATING HE SAW IT ALL THE TIME.   HE SHOWED ME A PACKAGE OF SMALL PARTS FROM NISSAN CORP.WHICH HE SAID THEY SENT OUT TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM.  HE EXPLAINED NISSAN CHANGED THE TRANSMISSION  STYLE FOR APPROX. A 3 YEAR PERIOD (96-98?), USING A SOLENOID (I BELIEVE) THAT HE SAID \"FAILED IN ALL CARS MADE WHEN THE CARS REACHED 80,000 MILES.\"  HE SAID THE CARS MADE BEFORE AND AFTER THE 3 YEARS DIDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM.    MY CAR WAS 3 1/2 YEARS OLD AND HAD 67,525 MILES. THE DRIVETRAIN WARRANTYDIDN'T COVER THE CARSINCE IT WAS MORE THAN 3 YRS OLD AND HAD MORE THAN 60K MILES.  PARTS REPLACED WERE TORQUE CONVERTER, BANNER KIT (NISSAN'S KIT), BAND, DRUM GEAR, SUN GEAR FRONT, PLANETARY GEAR SET FRONT AND REAR, AND 10 QRTS OF TRANS. OIL.  PARTS COST $909, LABOR  $360. DUE TO THE REPAIR SHOP'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROBLEM WITHOUT ANY INSPECTION, THEIR POSSESSION OF 'NISSAN FIXER KIT', AND PROBABLE LRG % OF CARS WITH SAME PROBLEM, I THINK NISSAN BUILT A FAULTY CAR COMPONENT, KNEW ABOUT IT,AND EVEN DESIGNED THE TRANNY THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUT IN THE CAR ORIGINALLY. I EXPERIENCED NO ACCIDENT OR INJURY, BUT IF THE PARTS CAME LOOSE WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY IT COULD CAUSE VERY QUICK 'SEIZING' STOPS WITH NO WARNING (BRAKE LIGHTS), AND POSSIBLE PROJECTILE LIKE BEHAVIOR OF THE PARTS.

I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR A DIFFERENT KIND OF SEAT BELT AND THEY SAID ALL THEY CAN DO IS ORDER THE SAME ONE THEY REPLACED THAT BROKE WHICH I DON'T WANT BECAUSE IT ISN'T SAFE IT CAN'T HOLD A 30 LB. KID.  WHEN I CALLED 1-800-NISSAN1 THE LADY ON THE PHONE TOLD ME THAT IT ISN'T MEANT FOR CAR SEATS IT PUTS TOO MUCH OF A STRAIN ON THE SEAT BELT CAUSING IT TO BREAK.  I CALLED THE HIGHWAY PATROL BECAUSE THAT IS WEAR THEY INSTALL IT AND THEY SAID UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD A SEAT BELT BREAK.  IT IS ALSO IN THE CAR MANUAL TO INSTALL THE CAR SEAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BACK SEAT AS WELL.  I AM LUCKY THAT I WASN'T INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT THAT MAY HAVE SEVERLY INJURED OR KILLED MY DAUGHTER.
