All the warning lights in the electrical panel lit up after the engined turned off. After getting off the road and sitting for a few minutes the car started with no problem.  After driving 20 minutes, we stopped and tried to use the controls in the driver side door to put the window down. No controls in the driver door functioned. I took the car in for repair but there were no loaner cars and was told they would have to keep the car at least two weeks. I needed transportation so I waited to take the car in.   The engine turned off two additional times while i was driving with no warning. I took the car in to the Ford dealership again. They said the door control problem was a fuse and they would have to try to find what was shorting out the fuse. They did not have any comment about the engine stalling out which I reported. They have had the car 4 weeks. I see that some 2013 escape models have been recalled for the engine stalling.  I think my car should be added to the recall. I really need my transportation.

        "summary": "I recently had a potentially deadly encounter while driving on an interstate. While traveling at 55 mph, my (automatic transmission) vehicle suddenly shifted into first gear on its own. I can\u2019t begin to explain how much stopping force that created on the vehicle and my body, so much so that it caused the vehicle to momentarily skid. Had it not been for my seat belt and an alert tractor trailer driver, the result could have been deadly. This is the second time this has happed with my vehicle. After the first time that this happened the vehicle went to an ASE Certified mechanic shop for evaluation. After an extended period of time, the mechanic could find nothing wrong with the vehicle. As is common knowledge, if an \u201cerror code\u201d isn\u2019t produced, a mechanic can only hope to replicate the same event to help assist in diagnosing the problem. After this last incident, I noticed a display (not an error code) which read: ENGINE MALFUNCTION SERVICE NOW. Armed with this information the mechanic called Ford for more information. To my dismay, Ford would not elaborate, give insight, share, or even acknowledge such a problem exist with their vehicles. I conducted my own research with this issue, only to find out that Ford are the masters at vehicles randomly shifting to first gear for no apparent reason. All of the recalls for Ford vehicles about this problem and my vehicle is not listed. I find it very difficult to believe that I am the only person to have experienced this same issue in the same vehicle. Peoples lives are at stake.",

When I look at my coolant, it is right at the minimum line every time. I have since learned to keep a bottle of coolant in my car as well as a funnel to fill it just a little. Afterward, it would drive okay. Every shop I have taken it to states there are no leaks, and it was working just fine. I've also been told that it's a common issue with the 2013 Ford Escape, and I will have to continue to fill it. This has been an issue as I have been stuck on the freeway with my 3 and 7 year old numerous times trying to get under my hood with the car shut off in negative degree weather. I DO NOT feel safe getting out of the car to fill the coolant with my children in the backseat on a freeway with cars flying past me. Winter of 2022, the issue became worse. I was turning and saw smoke pouring out of my hood, and my check engine light came on. Luckily, I was right by my destination, where it quit working altogether and coolant emptied altogether. My husband, a former mechanic, is replacing the overflow coolant reservoir hose, which broke. The head gasket appears to be okay; however, he believes there may be tiny cracks in the head gasket which would explain why all of the shops I've been to state there is no leak.  My vehicle is available for inspection upon request. My kids safety, my safety, and those on the road are at risk every time my vehicle stalls, especially with no heat. At times, my hood is frozen shut, and I cannot open it right away, so my kids and I freeze until I can get the hold open while I hope no one hits my car while the roads are icy.  No one has been able to reproduce the issue at a shop. My check engine light comes on periodically every winter but will disappear the same day. It also came on moments before the hose burst.",

After about 10 - 15 seconds, the information came back, the speedometer worked, and the dash warning lights went off. This has occurred multiple times a day since Jan 2 while I drive my car. The Ford website described a recall that fit the description of the issues I have been having and, according to my VIN, I was eligible to get the system serviced. I took my car in to Wade Ford in Atlanta, GA on January 5, 2022. A diagnostic test reported code PC0031, but only codes P1934 and P062C are considered eligible. I called Ford and opened a case (see Line 1). After waiting a few hours to hear back from Ford, I had to check in at work and perform a COVID test to remain eligible to work the rest of this week per their COVID protocol. On my way there, my throttle became unresponsive as I was getting on the highway. The acceleration came back a few seconds later, narrowly avoiding the car behind me running into my bumper. After testing, I returned to the dealership to find no progress had been made due to Ford being unresponsive.  The agent has not responded or updated me, but she stated on an earlier call she was working on consulting her supervisor on my case. Further attempts to call Ford have been unsuccessful. Because this issue is not recognized under any Ford warranty, I have no lease or lease reimbursement options. The cost of having Ford fix the bug they downloaded into my car is into the hundreds of dollars. Even if Ford does decide to fix the issue, I have no assurance this issue won't happen again at the next software update. My vehicle is not safe to be driven at this point.

Sophie Rosa, Service Advisor told me that the mechanic reported the lug nuts on the wheels were swollen and need replacement.  She advised that if not replaced it would cause trouble if a flat tire occurred as the Ford issued lug nut wrench would not fit over the swollen lug nuts.  I agreed to have the 20 lug nuts replaced at a cost of $5.36 each plus labor.  I did not get the defective nuts returned to me.  Checking on-line I found that swollen lug nuts is caused by chrome being overlaid on metal lug nuts which cause rust to occur and thereby causes the swelling to occur.  This defect is caused by the Ford Company knowing full well that placing two different metals together can cause corrosive and rust problems.",

I had to get a new tire to pass inspection so had to wait for tht to come in 12/20/21They did their part but called and said it would have to go to the dealership for the steering problem they had removed the battery thinking it would reset itself.  Jeff then took it up to Woltz Wind Ford which was about 1 mile up the road - had trouble steering.  Because of the holiday and days off they did not get to my car till 12/27 they told me that the Steering Gear box had to be replaced.  In researching online I saw that Ford had recalls on 20008 and 2011 for the same problem.  My vehicle has41,958 miles on it.  Apparently Ford still has the same problem with steering issues  The representative just said that parts wear out that I did nothing to cause this problem.  I have to get this car repaired to the tune of $2200 plus it is still there will send invoice when I get it.  Just glad I was not on the highway when this happened.  Definitely a safety issue   Obviously the 2013 needed to be recalled as well.",

Suddenly, I hear a ding, and look down and the 'engine coolant low' warning comes on, then another ding, and the 'danger of overheating' warning comes on, I look at the temperature gauge and it's right at normal.  Within 3 seconds of the overheating warning coming on, while I was in heavy active rush hour traffic the engine just died, shut off, no power, nothing and all the dash lights came on.  Luckily I had a little momentum and was able to pull over (after having to cross two lanes of traffic) safely and turned off the car. I waited a few minutes and then started it back up, the temp gauge now, shot to the top, but quickly came back down to normal, the coolant light warning was off with just the check engine light on. I pulled into a gas station purchased coolant and much to my surprise when I opened the hood, it wasn't low at all and was just slightly above the Minimum mark. I put a little in (but not over MAX) and was able to get it to a mechanic, but they can't look at it until tomorrow (12/14/21) as they were about to close.

I got out of the vehicle, no flat tire, nothing appeared different from when I parked the vehicle 36 hours prior. No signs that it had been struck since then. No obstructions behind or under the vehicle. I got back in and tried again. I was able to get it up onto the sidewalk but in a very unintended position. Further attempts did get it partially into the driveway but I nearly hit the picket fence in the front yard in doing so. With it now half on the sidewalk and half in the driveway, I put the brake on satisfied it was now off the street and no longer subject to city parking violation penalty. I had to cancel my work meeting and called the auto club for a tow. During the tow service pick-up, it appeared that the front driver side wheel was not aligning with the steering mechanism but we could manually position the wheel so we could get enough movement and position the vehicle  and move it by chain onto the tow truck platform.  Prior to parking the vehicle in front of the house, I had driven it without any problems. There was no evidence that it had been damaged or impacted by another vehicle or vandal.",

I was permanently disabled from military service so they made me purchase a very expensive warranty and because I couldn\u2019t work my credit had suffered while waiting on my VA and SS. That cost me 18% interest, but we had no vehicle as we had to give it back while recovering from 8 surgeries . Never missed a payment but I think I know why the bank made me pay $1800 for the warranty in cash. Less than a month both drive shafts had to be replaced. $400 out of pocket. Then Ford said I had a leak and replaced a gasket, which triggered a Ford mandated replacement of the flanged fuel line not covered by warranty. $800 out of pocket. Back up camera is a joke. They have no answer. NOW MOST DANGEROUS ISSUSE. When ever we would slow down our car lost power and stalled. The car had to be turned off and restarted. Extremely dangerous for anyone, but with my three Grandchildren we had to get to the bottom of it. Another Ford dealership said it was a bad battery. Charged me $140.00 and didn\u2019t change the battery. We bought a $200 battery but this has not stop the problem. Seems when you let off gas is mainly when. Making Red lights and stops dangerous, your at a stop light or sign you must be aware that the car could stall 50/50. We can\u2019t put our Grandchildren in the car. It\u2019s not safe We paid $400 to replace the fuel something or other, that controls the amount of fuel going into the combustion chamber as I was told, BUT nope hasn\u2019t worked. NOW when the car does take off the RPM shots up before the gears shift. We took it to get the code read and it\u2019s telling us to replace the TURBO. If they said something should be fixed we fixed it. I ask them about recalls on 2013 Ford Escapes and was told straight to my face there were non though I had gotten letters regarding the doors.

Car gave Evac code of a solenoid sensor issue. Team suggested solenoid replacement and new spark plugs - work done and picked up Friday 8/6/2021. By Monday 8/9/2021 Check engine light back on. Took back to dealer service. Code given out was #4 Cylinder Misfire and cylinder was \"wet\" looking. Overnight pressure test was completed and leaking was found from the coolant system into the engine. A boarscope was used and coolant was found on top of #4 piston. Engine is leaking coolant internally. Service Manager at dealership says this is a design flaw not an indication of use/wear/tear. Said there was a tech bulletin put out about the flaw, but that tech sheet has now been wiped from their system. There is a former recall in 2012 about a similar issue affecting the 2013 Ford Escape and 2013 Fusion. Ford denied our request because of their policy that the date of the warranty (2/13/2013) is more than 7 years old. We believe this is a design flaw of the engine itself and not a wear and tear issue. Our concern is how many of these vehicles are on the road and are having the same issue unknown to the owners. The additional coolant/liquid in the engine can cause the engine to corrode or sieze while driving - creating a hazard condition.",

I contacted Ford and my car was manufactured on May 13, so it is not covered.  This is extremely dangerous.  Had I not done research online I was not aware that my car was not in park and all I had to do was simply push it forwards or backwards-with ease-to get it to roll. I have choked the tires to prevent this. But Ford refuses to fix it and I cannot locate a very simple replacement part that costs about $20 and 2 minutes to fix. Rather, I will have to spend $500+ towing to have an entire new cable installed. This is EXTREMELY dangerous and defective. Forth-eight hours or less for this not to be include in the recall is more than concerning and this recall must be updated to include more cars.

This occurred in heavy traffic, on a highway while I was in a middle lane. This made it hard to get to the shoulder and other drivers were not letting me move over easily.

They have seen the vehicle overheat and have downloaded the codes from the vehicles computer that confirm the issue.   Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others? - The vehicle has been inspected by the manufacturer's engineers.  Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? - Yes, there was a warning each time the vehicle overheated. However, the warning happened simultaneously to the overheat issue. So, while it technically warned me - it was a moot point because i was already traveling at city street speeds.    This is a recurring issue that began 5+ years ago and persists today. Ford has not been able to properly diagnose the root cause, or provide a fix to the issue. I am nervous to put my family in this vehicle.   Uploading the initial service request below - can provide additional files if needed.",

MY FORD STALLED FOR THE FIRST TIME A FEW MONTHS AGO. I WAS AT AN EVENT THAT I MADE IT TO  WITH NO ISSUES. IT SAT IN THE PARKING LOT FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES. WHEN I TRIED TO LEAVE, IT WOULDN'T  TURN ON. I SAT IN THE VEHICLE FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES UNTIL IT FINALLY STARTED AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE AWAY. EVER SINCE THIS, IT HAS BEEN STALLING EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. SOMETIMES IT WILL START AND I CAN DRIVE A FEW YARDS AWAY BEFORE IT STALLS AND I AM FORCED TO TURN THE KEY OFF AND TRY AGAIN. IT WOULD DO THIS A FEW TIMES THEN I WOULD BE ABLE TO DRIVE AGAIN. ANOTHER ISSUE I'VE HAD IS SOMETIMES WHILE I AM DRIVING, EVERYTHING WILL SHUT OFF BUT THE VEHICLE WILL KEEP DRIVING. EVERYTHING MEANING: AIR CONDITIONING, ALL LIGHTS, RADIO, TOUCH SCREEN.. ANYTHING THAT IS ON WHILE I'M DRIVING WILL SHUT OFF FOR AROUND FIVE MINUTES OR SO. I KEEP GOING WITHOUT TOUCHING ANY OF THESE THINGS, THEN THEY WILL ALL TURN BACK ON, ON THEIR OWN. THIS HAPPENS VERY RARELY. I HAVE TAKEN MY FORD IN TO GET THESE ISSUES LOOKED AT. THEY TOLD ME THESE WERE RECALLS, PRINTED THE RECALL PAPERWORK OUT, AND TOLD ME TO GO TO A DEALERSHIP TO GET IT FIXED. WHEN I TOOK IT IN, I WAS TOLD THESE ISSUES WERE INDEED RECALLS FOR 2013 FORD ESCAPES BUT \"DID NOT APPLY TO MY VEHICLE\" AND WAS SENT AWAY. NOW, MY FORD RANDOMLY STARTED LEAKING GAS LAST WEEK AFTER ONLY JUST TURNING IT ON WHILE SITTING IN MY HOME DRIVEWAY (DIDN'T DRIVE ANYWHERE). I LOOKED UP \"GAS LEAKS IN 2013 FORD ESCAPE\" AND ITS A RECALL FOR 1.6-LITER ENGINE, WHICH IS WHAT I HAVE BUT WHEN I PUT THE VIN IN THE RECALL WEBSITE IT SAYS \"0 UNREPAIRED RECALLS\". WHY DO I KEEP HAVING THE SAME EXACT PROBLEMS THAT ARE DESCRIBED IN RECALL DETAILS FOR 2013 FORD ESCAPE BUT KEEP GETTING TOLD ITS NOT FOR MY 2013 FORD ESCAPE?",

ONE OF THE LATTER RECALLS (FORD RECALL CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 12S39) OCCURRED BEFORE I PICKED UP THE CAR, BUT I CONFIRMED THAT MY ENGINE WAS ONE OF THOSE AFFECTED BY THAT RECALL.  THUS, I HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT THE REPAIR RELATED TO THIS RECALL WAS EVER PERFORMED.  I TOOK THE CAR TO A DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THE OTHER RECALLS (FORD RECALLS 12S41 AND 13S12) ATTENDED TO.

I GOT IT IN PARK AND IT FINALLY RESTARTED AND I WAS ABLE TO PULL IN TO PARKING LOT.  IT WAS RAINING AND I COULD SEE A CAR COMING IN BEHIND ME, THANK GOD IT STARTED RIGHT BACKUP AGAIN.

I ALSO AM GETTING LOW ENGINE COOLANT EVEN THOUGH I FILL IT EVERY WEEK.

AFTER BACKING OUT OF THE SPACE, I PUT THE SHIFTER INTO D AND BEGAN TO TRY TO DRIVE FORWARD, BUT MY VEHICLE INSTEAD CONTINUED TO ROLL BACKWARDS. I IMMEDIATELY PRESSED MY BRAKE PEDAL, WHICH STOPPED IT FROM ROLLING BACKWARDS, AND PUT THE SHIFTER INTO P. THOUGH MY VEHICLE SHOWED THAT IT WAS IN PARK, IT CONTINUED TO ROLL BACKWARDS IF I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE. I WAS ABLE TO REVERSE MY CAR DOWN THE PARKING LOT AND BACK INTO A PARKING SPACE AT THE END OF THE LOT. ALL THE WHILE, MY 2013 ESCAPE SHOWED THAT IT WAS IN PARK. I TURNED MY VEHICLE OFF, BUT HAD TO ENGAGE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO ENSURE THAT IT WOULD NOT CONTINUE ROLLING BACKWARDS. WHEN I TRIED TO TURN THE VEHICLE BACK ON A MINUTE LATER, I WAS NOT ABLE TO PUSH THE BRAKE PEDAL DOWN. IT BECAME LOCKED, AND I COULDN'T TURN THE ENGINE ON, SHIFT, OR DO ANYTHING EXCEPT TURN PRESS THE IGNITION BUTTON TO TURN ON/OFF THE RADIO/AC/LIGHTS/ELECTRICAL, ETC. (DURING THIS WHOLE TIME, THERE WAS NEVER ANY WARNING LIGHTS LIT OR ANY INDICATION AT ALL THAT A PROBLEM WAS ABOUT TO OCCUR OR CURRENTLY OCCURING.) I HAD IT TOWED TO THE NEAREST FORD DEALERSHIP, WHERE THEY CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS THE SHIFTER ASSEMBLY/CABLE THAT BROKE, WHICH IS THE EXACT ISSUE IN THE RECALL FORD ISSUED ON OVER 500,000 2013 FORD ESCAPES IN JULY 2018. HOWEVER, DESPITE MY VEHICLE HAVING THE EXACT MECHANICAL FAILURE AS DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL NOTICE, I WAS TOLD BY FORD WHEN I CONTACTED THE MANUFACTURER DIRECTLY, THAT MY VEHICLE WAS ASSEMBLED AT A PLANT THAT HAS NOT BEEN ADDED TO THE RECALL. OBVIOUSLY THIS ISSUE IS MORE VAST AND WIDESPREAD THAN FORD IS WILLING TO ADMIT. BECAUSE MY ESCAPE IS FROM A FACTORY THAT HASN'T BEEN ADDED TO THE RECALL YET, FORD REFUSES TO COVER THE COST OF REPAIRS. THIS IS INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING.",

I TRIED TO OPEN THE DOOR & GET INTO VEHICLE TO APPLY THE BRAKE, HOWEVER, THE DOOR MOMENTUM KNOCKED ME TO THE GROUND & I WAS DRAGGED BY THE DOOR OF THE VEHICLE AS THE VEHICLE WAS MOVING IN THE REVERSE DIRECTION.  I WAS LOOKING AT THE FRONT WHEEL AS I WAS BEING DRAGGED UNTIL THE CAR TURNED ENOUGH TO RELEASE ME FROM THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR. THE VEHICLE STOPPED WHEN ITS BACK BUMPER HIT THE VEHICLE FRONT BUMPER BEHIND IT.  THE WAS IDLING, AND THE VEHICLE WAS MOTIONLESS WHEN I GOT TO IT, IT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DRIVING IN REVERSE BUT WAS STATIONARY IDLING AS IF IT WAS IN PARK POSITION AGAIN.

PRIOR TO THE ENGINE LIGHT BLINKING THE CAR BEGIN TO MISFIRE, HESITATE WHEN TRYING TO ACCELERATE, AND THE ENGINE WOULD OVERHEAT FROM TIME TO TIME PREMATURELY. THE CAR WOULD SOMETIMES STALL AND MISFIRE WHEN TRYING TO ACCELERATE OR WHEN SITTING IDLE. WHEN I LOOKED ONLINE IT SHOWS A RECALL FOR THESE SPECIFIC ISSUES FOR THE SAME MAKE, MODEL & YEAR, BUT NOT FOR MY SPECIFIC ENGINE LITER. FOR EXAMPLE, IT SHOWS THE ENGINE OVERHEATING AND ENGINE WIRING SPLICES MAY CAUSE STALL FOR 2013 FORD ESCAPES BUT ONLY FOR 1.6L. MY CAR IS EXPERIENCING THE SAME EXACT ISSUES AS THOSE LISTED UNDER THE RECALL, BUT MY ENGINE IS A 2.0L. AT ONE POINT I BEGAN TO SEE WHITE SMOKE ONCE THE ENGINE LIGHT STARTED TO BLINK, AND SMELLED FUMES. NOT TOO LONG AFTER THAT BEGAN TO OCCUR I PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THE CAR STARTED TO MISFIRE AND STALL.",

SATURDAY EVENING APRIL, 29, 2017 ON I-85 SOUTHBOUND WHILE SLOWING FROM 65 MPH TO EXIT AT SOUTH HILL, VA DRIVER (DAUGHTER) APPLIED BRAKES AND HAD NO POWER ASSIST. THIS PRODUCED A PEDAL THAT WAS STIFF AND HER ENTIRE BODY WEIGHT HAD TO BE USED TO CAUSE ANY SLOWING.  THE VEHICLE WAS STOPPED USING THE GRADE OF THE RAMP AND E BRAKE. THE VEHICLE HAD NO WARNING LIGHTS OR INDICATIONS OF FAILURE.  AFTER TOWING IT HOME SUNDAY APRIL 30TH IT WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALERSHIP. THEY DIAGNOSED A VACUUM PUMP FAILURE.  THE VACUUM PUMP BEING SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BRAKING SYSTEM CAUSES IMMEDIATE LOSS OF BRAKING ON FAILURE. THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY CONDITIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE PRESENT IN THE BELT DRIVEN VACUUM PUMP ON 2011-2012 FORD F-150 ECOBOOST. SEVERAL DAYS LATER WHEN THE DEALERSHIP ATTEMPTED TO FIX THE VACUUM PUMP THEY FOUND THAT THE FAILURE CAUSED THE CAM CORE COUPLER TO SHEAR. THIS ALLOWED METAL SHARDS INTO THE OIL WHICH THEN CARRIED THEM TO THE ENGINE AND TURBO DAMAGING BOTH.  THE DEALERSHIP CAME BACK WITH AN ESTIMATE OF $6000 FOR JUST THE REPAIRS WITH A NEW ENGINE, HOWEVER THEY INFORMED US THAT THE TURBO NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AS WELL DUE TO THE DAMAGE.  WORKERS AT THE DEALERSHIP REPORTED THAT THE COST TO FIX THE CAR FAR OUTSTRIPPED THE RESIDUAL VALUE.  MILEAGE FAILURE WAS 60,921.

ANYWAY, I WAS INFORMED THAT THE PART WOULDN'T CAUSE IMMEDIATE DAMAGE, BUT EVENTUALLY THE TURBO ENGINE WOULD START FALLING APART AND WOULD CAUSE METAL DEBRIS TO SHOOT INTO MY EXHAUST, CAUSING A WHOLE WORLD OF OTHER ISSUES. THE PART TO HAVE REPLACED IS ON BACK ORDER UNTIL AUGUST BECAUSE APPARENTLY MANY PEOPLE WITH THE SAME CAR ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES. ITS GOING TO COST ME 1400.00 TO FIX THIS ISSUES BECAUSE I BOUGHT THE CAR \"AS IS\".

THERE WAS NO WAY OF KNOWING THAT THE DAMAGE WAS OCCURING.  SPOKE WITH FORD REPRESENTATIVES.  SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS APPROX. 12,000 MILES OUTSIDE OF WARRANTY, NO REPAIRS OR REIMBURSEMENT WOULD BE PROVIDED BY THEM.  SPOKE WITH THE EXTENDED WARRANTY REPS.  BECAUSE THE PART THAT INITIALLY FAILED WAS A NON-LUBRICATED PART, NO SERVICES WOULD BE COVERED.  THE COST TO REPAIR THE ENGINE IS $9,411.  COST TO TEAR THE ENGINE APART AND DIAGNOSE WAS $1585.08.  BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE AT 62,000 MILES IN GOOD FAITH THAT THIS WAS A RELIABLE VEHICLE.  ALL SERVICE WAS DONE ON TIME WITH RECOMMENDED SERVICE, WITH SERVICE RECORDS ON HAND",

LUCKILY WE WERE NOT ON THE HIGHWAY AND WAS ABLE TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  I WAS GIVEN LITTLE NOTICE OF THE SAFETY MODE.  I WISH HAD I HAD THE CODE NUMBER THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY RESET.

PLEASE NOTE THAT EARLIER MODEL YEAR FORD ESCAPES HAVE A SIMILAR PROBLEM AND HAVE BEEN RECALLED UNDER NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 14V284000 AND FORD RECALL NUMBER 14S05. AS THIS ISSUE IS IDENTICAL TO THE PRIOR RECALL, I STRONGLY SUGGEST ADDING THE 2013 MODEL YEAR FORD ESCAPE VEHICLES TO THE RECALL.    THE MOST COMMON TIME FOR THE POWER STEERING TO FAIL WAS RIGHT AFTER STARTUP AND MANEUVERING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT ON A CITY STREET OR GARAGE. AT THIS LOW SPEED MANUAL STEERING IS DIFFICULT AND AGGRESSIVE BRAKING IS REQUIRED TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT ONCE THE INABILITY TO SETTER IS APPARENT TO THE DRIVER.    ONCE THE STEERING FAILS AND THE FAULT MESSAGE APPEARS, IT COULD BE OCCASIONALLY RESET BY SHUTTING DOWN THE ENGINE AND RESTARTING THE CAR. TURNING OFF A CAR ON A PUBLIC ROAD TO REGAIN STEERING CONTROL IS UNDESIRABLE AND UNSAFE.    I SPOKE WITH BOTH FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THE FORD DEALERSHIP AND BOTH CLAIMED THAT THERE ARE NO TSBS OR RECALLS DESCRIBING THE LOSS OF POWER STEERING  FOR THE 2013 FORD ESCAPE.

VEHICLE WAS BROUGHT TO 2 DIFFERENT FORD DEALERS FOR SAME PROBLEM AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY COULD DIAGNOSE AND/OR REPLICATE PROBLEM.  THIS ISSUE AND CIRCUMSTANCE HAS BEEN REPORTED NUMEROUS TIMES UPON GOGGLE SEARCHES (PLEASE SEE BELOW).    I CONTACTED THE FORD CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP CENTER AGAIN TODAY TO DOCUMENT THE SITUATION SURROUNDING OUR VEHICLE (CASE # 8980601). PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAD CONTACTED THEM ORIGINALLY ON FEBRUARY 29TH (CASE #8916920) AND THEY REFERRED ME TO THE FLOOD DEALERSHIP AFTER WE HAD BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO THE TASCA DEALERSHIP ON FEBRUARY 28TH AND 29TH.   THEY TRIED TO CONTACT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT FLOOD FORD AT 4:00PM TODAY BUT WERE NOT ABLE TO GET THROUGH.   I ALSO CONTACTED THE CONSUMERS FOR AUTO RELIABILITY AND SAFETY AND THEY RESPONDED BACK WITH THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE AND STRONGLY EMPHASIZED NOT TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL CRASH RISK.    I AM ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF REPORTING THE DEFECT TO THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION AND HAVE ALSO CONTACTED THE WJAR CONSUMER ADVOCATE DEPARTMENT SURROUNDING OUR DILEMMA TO SEE IF THEY CAN HELP US AS WELL.   HOPEFULLY THE EXPERTS AT FORD CAN HELP PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS AS TO HOW TO BEST ADDRESS THIS SITUATION.

THIS OSTENSIBLY MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR A DRIVER TO LOCK THEIR KEYS INSIDE THE CAR.

ON THREE OCCASIONS, INCLUDING TODAY (6/11/2015) THIS SYSTEM HAS MALFUNCTIONED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT ITS BEHAVIOR WAS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF ITS INTENDED DESIGN AND IT BECAME A SAFETY HAZARD. EACH OCCASION HAS INVOLVED MY WIFE, WHO NATURALLY CARRIES THE KEYS IN HER PURSE OR BRIEFCASE. SHE HAS GOTTEN OUT OF THE CAR AND CLOSED THE DOOR WITHOUT LOCKING THE CAR MANUALLY. HER KEYS REMAINED IN HER BAG ON THE PASSENGER FLOORBOARD OR SEAT, WHILE SHE WALKED AROUND THE CAR TO RETRIEVE THEM OR TO GO TO RETRIEVE OUR SON OUT OF HIS CAR SEAT IN THE BACK.  ON THESE OCCASIONS THE CAR HAS LOCKED ITSELF WITH THE KEYS INSIDE AS SOON AS SHE CLOSED HER DOOR AND SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO GET INTO THE CAR.   THERE ARE TWO MAJOR FAILINGS OCCURRING.   THE CARS SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO PREVENT THE LOCKING OF THE DOORS OR IMMEDIATELY UNLOCK THEM IF THE CAR IS PARKED AND IT FAILS TO DETECT A DRIVER IN THE SEAT.   THE CAR HAS NO FUNCTIONALITY THAT AUTO LOCKS THE CAR WHEN IT IS OFF AND STATIONARY, YET IT IS DOING THIS. IF YOU GET OUT OF THE CAR WITHOUT THE KEYS AND CLOSE THE DOOR, IT WILL LOCK ITSELF.

THE CAR HAD NO PICKUP EVEN WITH THE LITTLE PRESSURE I APPLIED TO THE GAS PEDAL. THE TACHOMETER WAS ACTING SPORADIC AND THE ENGINE FELT AS THOUGH IT WAS CLOSE TO CUTTING OUT. I DECIDED TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION AND SINCE WE WERE IN A BIG OPEN PARKING LOT I DECIDED TO PARK THE CAR AND CALL FOR A TOW TRUCK TO TAKE US TO THE NEAREST FORD DEALERSHIP.   THE DEALER (BASIL FORD, CHEEKTOWAGA, NY) KEPT THE CAR OVERNIGHT AND REPLACED A SENSOR.    11/9/14: AT LOCAL SHOPPING CENTER, I STARTED THE CAR THE 'ENGINE FAULT SERVICE NOW' NOTICE CAME ON AGAIN AND WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN GEAR AND APPLIED PRESSURE TO THE GAS PEDAL I COULD FEEL THE ENGINE WAS SLUGGISH. BUT THIS TIME I PARKED THE CAR AND TURNED THE ENGINE OFF AND WAITED FOR A MINUTE AND TURNED THE ENGINE BACK ON. WHEN I TURNED CAR BACK ON THE ENGINE FAULT NOTICE DID NOT COME ON AND THE ENGINE SEEMED FINE. APPARENTLY THE SENSOR FIX DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM CONCERNED FOR SAFETY NOW BASED ON OTHER REPORTS BY DRIVERS.   *TR",

IF YOU TURNED IT OFF AND RESTARTED IT, WOULD BE OK AND LIGHT WOULD NOT COME BACK ON. THIS STARTED AROUND 28,000 MILES. I TOOK TO FORD DEALER AND THEY KEPT FOR A DAY, HOOKED TO COMPUTER AND TOLD ME NOTHING WAS COMING UP AS WRONG. THEY TOOK IT OUT ON THE ROAD AND COULD NOT REPLICATE IT.  BUT THEY DID FIX 5 RECALLS ON IT!  4 DAYS LATER WITH THE AIR CONDITIONER ON WHILE MAKING A LEFT TURN ON A BUSY ROAD, THE ENGINE WENT COMPLETELY DEAD. I NEARLY MISSED HAVING A CAR HIT ME BROADSIDE. THEN 5 DAYS LATER AS I WAS MAKING A RIGHT HAND TURN, THE ENGINE ONCE AGAIN COMPLETELY DIED. BY SOME VERY GOOD LUCK THE CAR BEHIND ME WAS ABLE TO GO AROUND ME. I HAD MY SMALL GRANDSON AND GRANDDAUGHTER IN THE BACK SEAT. THEY COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED HAD I BEEN REAR ENDED. I CALLED THE FORD DEALER AND WAS TOLD MY THE SERVICE MANAGER WHAT DID I EXPECT THEM TO DO SINCE IT KEEPS TELLING THEM NOTHING IS WRONG WHEN HOOKED TO THE COMPUTER ( IN A VERY SARCASTIC TONE). THEN AGAIN TODAY, THE ENGINE WENT COMPLETELY DEAD COMING OUT OF MY GRANDDAUGHTER SCHOOL IN FRONT OF A SCHOOL BUS!! I THINK FORD IS GOING TO WAIT UNTIL PEOPLE ACTUALLY DIE IN A AN ACCIDENT BEFORE EVEN ATTEMPTING TO TRY TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM. I AM SO DISTRAUGHT THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

UNFORTUNATELY, WITH THE 2013 FORD ESCAPE, THE AIR BAG LIGHT CAN EITHER FAIL TO LIGHT, FLASH OR COME ON CONSTANTLY.  OURS DID NOT FLASH, AND IS AMBER, SO WE DROVE IT FOR A WEEK BEFORE WE NOTICED THE LIGHT WAS ON.    HOWEVER, A PREMATURE FAILURE OF THE RCM MODULE AT 10 MONTHS OF AGE AND 8600 MILES IS INDICATIVE TO ME OF ANOTHER POTENTIAL RECALL ISSUE.
