GOING DOWN HILLS AND GOING UP AN SHORT INCLINES THE VEHICLE DOES THE SAME JERKING MOTION, FORWARD AND BACK UNTIL I COME TO A COMPLETE STOP. WHEN TAKING OFF AND KEEPING A LOW SPEED UNDER 35 MPH THE VEHICLE CANNOT MAINTAIN THE SPEED, IT ACTS LIKE IT WANTS TO STOP ( IT NEVER HAS DIED) BUT I HAVE TO PUNCH THE ACCELERATOR TO GET THE VEHICLE TO PICK UP ITS SPEED AGAIN. WHILE I WAS IN A SCHOOL PICK UP LINE JUST COASTING ALONG AROUND 10 MPH, MY FOOT WAS NOT ON THE ACCELERATOR OR BRAKE AND THE VEHICLE MOVED FORWARD ON ITS OWN. THE ISSUES SEEM TO ALL HAPPEN AT A LOW SPEED, FROM 0-40MPH. I HAVE TAKEN THIS VEHICLE IN TO THE CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS FOR THE SAME ISSUES AS I HAVE DESCRIBED ABOVE. EACH TIME THEY ARE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE ISSUE. MY BIGGEST AGGRAVATION IS THAT THIS VEHICLE DOES NOT DO THIS EVERY TIME I DRIVE IT, WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO BE DUPLICATED. I AM CONCERNED THAT WHEN I AM COMING TO A STOP THAT THE VEHICLE WILL NOT STOP AND REAR END ANOTHER VEHICLE. THIS ISSUE STARTED AROUND 2000 MILES AND HAS CONTINUED TO THIS DAY, CURRENTLY THIS VEHICLE HAS 7500 MILES ON IT.  *TR",
