SHE WAS ABLE TO PUT THE CLUTCH IN AND STOP THE CAR AND TURN THE ENGINE OFF. THEN SHE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE NEAREST REPAIR SHOP.  IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT A PLASTIC PART ON THE TIP OF THE THROTTLE CAM HAD BROKEN OFF AND AS A RESULT THE THROTTLE CABLING MECHANISM STUCK IN THE PARTIALLY \"OPEN\" POSITION.  I HAD THE THROTTLE CAM REPLACED WITH AN ALL STAINLESS STEEL CAM WHICH CANNOT BREAK DOWN AS A RESULT OF HEAT, AS PLASTIC OR A SIMILAR PRODUCT CAN DO.    I HAD OEM CAMS REPLACED IN BOTH S4'S. AUDI DEALER WAS  NOTIFIED OF THE PROBLEM IN OCTOBER 2007.  I HAVE RECOMMENDED TO AUDI THAT ALL 1992-1997 S4 AND S6 MODELS BE RECALLED AND THAT ALL THROTTLE CAMS BE REPLACED WITH AN ALL STAINLESS STEEL CAM (FOR EXAMPLE, ONE FABRICATED BY 034 MOTORSPORT IN FREMONT, CA.)  AT LEAST ONE OTHER INSTANCE OF UNINTENDED ACCELERATION, DUE TO FAILURE OF THE OEM THROTTLE CAM, HAS BEEN REPORTED ON THE \"WEB\" -- IN FACT THAT REPORT LED ME TO 034 MOTORSPORT'S SOLUTION.
