IT DID STOP AFTER A FEW SECONDS BUT I TOOK IT IMMEDIATELY TO MY NEIGHBORHOOD CAR MECHANIC.  HE COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM BUT FOUND A DEFECTIVE AIR POLLUTION PART AND REPLACED IT.  THE NEXT DAY, WHILE WAITING TO TAKE A LEFT TURN AT AN INTERSECTION, THE ENGINE SUDDENLY RACED AGAIN AND WITH ME PRACTICALLY STANDING ON THE BRAKE WE SLID ACROSS THE INTERSECTION HEADED TOWARDS ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  LUCKILY PEOPLE SLOWED ENOUGH FOR ME TO SLIDE ACROSS THE INTERSECTION WITH RUBBER BURNING, ENGINE WHINING, ETC.  A FEW SECONDS LATER IT STOPPED.  I WAS ONLY ABOUT A MILE FROM THE DEALER THAT I HAD PURCHASED IT FROM SO I IMMEDIATELY DROVE THERE AND PULLED INTO THE SERVICE DEPT. AREA. I EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY COULDN'T LOOK AT IT TODAY BUT COME BACK TOMMORROW.  I SAID THAT I WASN'T ABOUT TO KEEP DRIVING IT WITH THIS PROBLEM AND THEY SAID THAT I COULD PARK IT IN THEIR LOT AND THEY WILL LOOK AT IT TOMMORROW.  I SAID \"YOU CAN PARK IT IN YOUR LOT, I'M NOT DRIVING IT.\"  THE NEXT DAY THEY CALLED AND SAID IT MUST BE SOMETHING WITH THE ONBOARD COMPUTER AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE IT, COST $1100 NOT UNDER WARRANTY.  WHAT COULD I DO?  SO OF COURSE I DID IT AND COMPLAINED BUT IT APPEARS TO HAVE FIXED IT SINCE IT HASN'T HAPPENED AGAIN.  I STILL OWN IT. *TR",

THEN, ON OCT. 20, 2008, 8 MONTHS LATER WITH THE MILEAGE JUST UNDER 60,000 MILES, THE SAME THING HAPPENED BUT IT WAS PRECEDED BY A SMELL OF BURNING RUBBER. IT WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND I WAS TOLD THAT THE ENGINE HARNESS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED ($2000 PARTS AND LABOR) AND THE IAC VALVE AND THE ECM AGAIN NEEDED TO REPLACED (ANOTHER $1700). AT FIRST, THE DEALER SAID THAT THE IAC VALVE AND ECM WERE COVERED UNDER THE NEW PARTS WARRANTY, BUT THEN I WAS TOLD THAT IF IT WAS THE ENGINE HARNESS THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE OF THE IAC VALVE AND THE ECM, THEY WERE NOT UNDER WARRANTY AND I'D HAVE TO PAY THE TOTAL BILL OF $3700! I STARTED A CASE FILE WITH NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND WAS TOLD BY A REGIONAL SPECIALIST THAT NISSAN COULD DO NOTHING FOR ME SINCE THE PARTS WERE NOT UNDER WARRANTY.  FROM THE INTERNET (AND NOT FROM THE DEALERSHIP), I LEARNED THAT THE ECM IS COVERED UNDER THE EPA SPECIFIED MAJOR EMISSION CONTROL COMPONENTS WARRANTY FOR 8 YEARS/80,000 MILES BUT NISSAN HAS DECLINED MY CLAIM, SAYING THAT THE IAC VALVE CAUSED THE FAILURE OF THE ECM THAT FIRST TIME IN FEB. 2008, SO THE ECM IS NOT COVERED BY THAT WARRANTY.  THERE IS NO LANGUAGE IN THE EPA WARRANTY THAT STATES THAT AS AN EXCLUSION AND THERE IS NO LANGUAGE IN NISSAN'S OWN NEW PARTS WARRANTY THAT STATES THAT AS AN EXCLUSION (I.E., A NEW PART IS NOT COVERED BY THE WARRANTY IF ITS FAILURE IS CAUSED BY ANOTHER NON-WARRANTED PART).  I HAVE READ ONLINE MANY, MANY SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE FAILURE OF THESE PARTS.  THIS SEEMS TO BE A VERY DANGEROUS DESIGN DEFECT WITH THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE SERIOUS HARM.  BOTH TIMES I NARROWLY AVOIDED ACCIDENTS.  NISSAN HASN'T BEEN WILLING TO HONOR THE WARRANTIES. I HAVE YET TO AUTHORIZE THE REPAIRS AND I AM NOT SURE WHAT TO DO NEXT. *TR",

[XXX] AND RECENTLY (ABOUT 2-3 MONTHS AGO) I STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS WITH MY FRONT SUSPENSION - WHENEVER I GO OVER BUMPS OR ANY SORT OF ROAD CRACKS, I HEAR THE BANGING (KNOCKING) SOUND IN MY FRONT SUSPENSION ON BOTH SIDES AND THE STEERING (HANDLING) HAS BECOME REALLY SLOPPY.  THIS WEEK I WAS ABOUT TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE MECHANIC BUT I ACCIDENTALLY CAME ACROSS SOME INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET REGARDING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH OVER 90,000 2001-2002 MAXIMAS THAT HAVE BEEN RECALLED BY NISSAN FOR FREE FIXING.  TO BE EXACT THE SAFETY NHTSA RECALL NUMBER IS 02V146 AND THE DESCRIPTION IS \"THE PIN AT THE END OF THE FRONT SUSPENSION TRANSVERSE LINK (LOWER CONTROL ARM) COULD BREAK WHERE IT IS MOUNTED TO THE FRAME, CAUSING A KNOCKING SOUND AND ABNORMAL STEERING, RESULTING IN DIFFICULTY CONTROLLING THE VEHICLE AND INCREASING THE RISK OF CRASH.  DEALERS SHOULD REPLACE THE TRANSVERSE LINKS ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES WITH NEW ONES.  OWNERS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THE FREE REMEDY WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME SHOULD CONTACT NISSAN.\"  ANYWAYS, THIS MORNING I CALLED NISSAN CANADA AND WAS TOLD THAT MY CAR WAS NOT RECALLED, BECAUSE APPARENTLY WHEN THEY BEGAN RECALLING ON JUNE 24, 2002, THEY DETERMINED THE MANUFACTURING DATE RANGE FROM JUNE 2001 TO JANUARY 2002.  MY CAR WAS MANUFACTURED IN OCTOBER 2000; HOWEVER IF IT HAS BEEN A SAFETY ISSUE FOR OVER 90,000 SAME VEHICLES - HOW ACCURATE THEIR DECISION IS???   ALL I WANT IS TO FEEL SAFE DRIVING MY CAR BUT IN MY CASE NISSAN DO NOT WISH TO COOPERATE.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE IS A WAY TO HELP ME AND TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE.  THE BEST WAY TO CONTACT ME IS E-MAIL: [XXX] OR CELL [XXX] OR [XXX].  PLEASE LET ME KNOW, HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO PROCESS AND RESOLVE THE ISSUE BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO DRIVE THE CAR KNOWING WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND ESPECIALLY KNOWING THAT IT IS A RECALL.

WE WERE TOLD THE MAIN WIRING HARNESS HAS GONE BAD - THIS VEHICLE ONLY HAS 34,000 MILES ON IT!  WE WERE TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD HAVE DONE TO PREVENT IT FROM GOING BAD - \"IT JUST WENT BAD\".    THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN INOPERABLE SINCE OCTOBER 5, 2004 - WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A NEW WIRING HARNESS, NISSAN SENT THE WRONG PART TO THE DEALERSHIP TWICE.  THE CORRECT PART WE ARE TOLD IS ON BACKORDER INDEFINATELY - NISSAN HAS NO IDEA WHEN THE PART WILL BECOME AVAILABLE.  A SUPERVISOR FROM NISSAN HAS FAILED TO RETURN MY PHONE CALLS AND THEY WILL NOT COVER THE REPAIR UNDER WARRANTY BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS 38 MONTHS OLD (EVEN THOUGH IT ONLY HAS 34,000 MILES ON IT).  HOW CAN A VEHICLE THAT IS ONLY 3 YEARS OLD HAVE A PART, THAT THE VEHICLE WILL NOT RUN WITHOUT, BE ON BACKORDER INDEFINATELY? AND, HOW CAN A MAJOR WIRING PART GO BAD SO SOON AND NISSAN NOT BE LIABLE FOR IT?  *AK",
