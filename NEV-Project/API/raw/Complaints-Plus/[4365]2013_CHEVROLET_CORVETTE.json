I'm come out into my garage this morning March 12th 2022 and there is a trail of fuel leaking from the rear driver's side of the car. Doing a quick online search I have found that this is a common problem on these cars . There is there is a plastic fitting on top of the fuel pump or the fuel tank itself is commonly known to develop a crack. This is an exceptionally dangerous situation as the fuel tank is very close to the hot exhaust when driving. Please advise as to any recourse I may have with GM or any Chevrolet dealership .

I was paranoid about driving the car for fear of an engine failure and averting an accident. After reading a plethora of horror stories about numerous LS7, 427 engine failures I felt anxious about driving my car and wanted to fix my engine ASAP and not a moment to soon!!!!  I took my car to a shop to determine the condition of  the valves and one intake had extensive play in the valve guide - .012\" wobble from side to side vs a factory spec of .003\". They didn\u2019t check the other head but assuming the worse.  I  just have my heads refurbed at with only 6k miles on my vehicle. This resulted in me spending $5,350 dollar to remedy the defect before the engine failed and potentially causing an accident.  ........this problem seems to be a manufactory defect potentially common to all 427/LS7s built between 2006 and 2013!!!!!",

EXTERIOR TEMPERATURE UPPER 80'S TO UPPER 90'S THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CARPET AND ARM REST STORAGE AREA WOULD EXCEED 120 DEG. LIFT UP A SUITCASE OR PUT ARM ON CONSOLE STORAGE AREA WOULD BURN YOUR ARM OR HAND. IF YOU LIFTED THE SUITCASE AND TOUCHED THE BOTTOM OR ARM ON ARMREST WOULD BURN YOU HAND OR ARM. HEAT INSIDE STORAGE AREA EXCEEDED EST. OF 130 DEG AND BURNED SPOTS IN CELL PHONE SCREEN AND COMPUTER IN SUITCASE MELTED HARD DRIVE AND RUINED COMPUTER.  THE AC ON INTERIOR HEAT WAS APPROX 75 DEGS, I HAVE A PRIVACY CURTAIN COVERING THE REAR STORAGE AREA THUS MAKING IT MUCH COOLER THAN ONE WITHOUT IT. ANYTHING TOUCHING CARPET IN REAR, INSIDE ARM REST OR PUTTING YOUR ARM ON THE REST WOULD BURN IT. YOU COULD NOT TOUCH UNDER SUITCASE OR HAVE SKIN TOUCHING THE REST WOULD BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. EXCESSIVE HEAT COMING FROM UNDER VEHICLE INTO THE TUNNEL WHERE TRANSMISSION AND EXHAUST ARE LOCATED DAMAGED THOSE ITEMS. THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT INSULATION UNDER CARPET OR UNDER VEHICLE TUNNEL CAUSES EXCESSIVE OVERHEATING. THERE NEEDS TO HAVE MORE INSULATION UNDER CARPET OR UNDER VEHICLE IN THE TUNNEL.

FAILURE TO CORRECT THIS DEFECTIVE CONDITION AFTER BEING PUT ON NOTICE AND REQUESTS FOR SAFE TIRES IGNORED.      I KNOW OF THIS PROBLEM SO I CAN AVOID THE DANGER.  YOU MUST RECALL ALL THESE CARS BECAUSE NOT ALL OWNERS ARE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM (I STUMBLED UPON IT BY ACCIDENT--IT IS DISCLOSED NO WHERE IS ANY SALES LITERATURE OR THE OWNERS MANUAL FOR THE CAR OR ANYWHERE ELSE THAT I AM AWARE OF AND I HAVE LOOKED AND ASKED CHEVROLET AND THEY IGNORED MY QUESTION) AND THEY TAKE THEIR LIVES AND THOSE OF INNOCENT BYSTANDERS IN THEIR HANDS IF THEY USE THE CAR BELOW 42 DEGREES F.  WHERE I LIVE THAT IS 6 MONTHS OF THE YEAR.  I HAVE EXTENSIVE CORRESPONDENCE WITH CHEVROLET IN WHICH THEY ADMIT THE PROBLEM EXISTS AND THAT THERE IS NO FIX FOR IT SO I AM OUT OF LUCK AND INNOCENT PEOPLE WILL BE KILLED AND GM COULD CARE LESS. I WILL BE HAPPY TO SHARE THIS CORRESPONDENCE WITH YOU, AND ENCOURAGE IT. THIS IS ABSOLUTE UNMITIGATED ARROGANCE ION GM'S PART AND SHOWS A CALLOUS AND WILLFUL DISREGARD FOR THE LIVES OF THEIR INNOCENT PURCHASERS AND BYSTANDERS AND MUST BE STOPPED. *TR",
