        "summary": "I HAVE ENCOUNTERED (3) COMPLETE ENGINE SHUT-DOWNS (FLAMEOUTS) ON MY MOTORCYCLE.   FIRST INCIDENT OCCURRED WHILE IN THE VEHICLES \"URBAN\" MODE (200 MILES). AT ABOUT 20 MPH AS I WAS GEARING DOWN, THE MOTOR SUDDENLY SHUT OFF. I IMMEDIATELY PRESSED THE START BUTTON, AND PROCEEDED ON WITHOUT INCIDENT. ATTRIBUTED THE SHUTDOWN, AT THE TIME,  TO A NEW BIKE ENDURING ITS BREAK-IN-PERIOD.    SECOND EVENT HAPPENED WHILE ATTEMPTING TO PULL OUT FROM AN INTERSECTION (400 MILES). I ROLLED ON THE THROTTLE, AND BEFORE I LEFT THE CLUTCH OUT, THE ENGINE SHUT OFF. I AM AN EXPERIENCED MOTORCYCLIST. I HAVE STALLED MOTORCYCLES BEFORE. THIS INCIDENT WAS DUE TO THE MACHINE AND WAS A BIT SCARY. INTERSECTION, CROSS TRAFFIC, ETC. I RE-STARTED THE MOTORCYCLE, AND DROVE AWAY WITHOUT INCIDENT.   THIRD EVENT TRANSPIRED AT NIGHTTIME (1750 MILES). THIS WAS BY FAR THE MOST ALARMING OF THE THREE. WHILE APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION, I PULLED IN THE CLUTCH LEVER TO DOWNSHIFT INTO FIRST GEAR, (20-25 MPH) AGAIN, THE ENGINE ABRUPTLY SHUT OFF. ALSO, WHEN THE SHUT-DOWN OCCURRED, THE MOTORCYCLES HEADLIGHTS WENT DARK. I WAS IN A PREDICAMENT. MY NIGHT-VISION WAS HANDICAPPED FURTHER BY THE INSTRUMENT LIGHTS SHINING TOWARD MY EYES. I IMMEDIATELY/CAUTIOUSLY BEGAN LEAVING THE CLUTCH LEVER OUT AS AN ATTEMPT TO REGAIN IGNITION AND LIGHTING(DRIFT START). I HAD ALREADY SELECTED FIRST GEAR, SO, THE COMPRESSION OF THE ENGINE, WAS GREATER THAN MY REAR WHEEL TRACTION, AND I BEGAN A REAR TIRE SKID THAT WAS RESOLVED BY PULLING THE CLUTCH LEVER. I THEN, WITH LOW NIGHTTIME VISIBILITY, DRIFTED THE MOTORCYCLE TO THE ROADWAY SHOULDER. I THEN RESTARTED THE DUCATI, AND CAUTIOUSLY DROVE HOME.    I HAVE DISCOVERED THERE ARE MANY MULTISTRADA OWNERS ON THE NET, AT \"DUCATI.MS.\", THAT ARE EXPERIENCING  THE UNEXPECTED FLAW       WITH THE 2010 MODEL YEAR.",
