I noticed that I was not the only one with this issue and Subaru should be made responsible for this shifter malfunction and not the customers. It should be a recall since many cars are experiencing the same issue with different models. I have to play around with the shifter in order to release my keys whenever I set it on park.

I finally went to a dealership when in June 2021 since I wanted the battery replaced expecting that it would be covered under the 85 month pro-rated warranty for the battery replacement in 2018. However, I was asked to pay for the battery as the previous replacement was a \"good will\" according to the dealership and so was not eligible for a free replacement.

NOT ONLY HAVE I NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE DRIVING DOWN THE SAME ROADS, IN THE SAME STATE OF REPAIR, BUT NEITHER HAVE MY PARENTS IN 20+ YEARS OF DRIVING 5 DIFFERENT MAKES/MODELS ON THE SAME ROADS.    NOT ONLY IS THE WINDSHIELD RIDICULOUSLY FRAGILE, SINCE I HAVE THE 'EYESIGHT' SAFETY FEATURE, I WAS TOLD THAT I COULD NOT REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD WITH AN OEM/GENERIC WINDSHIELD. I WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE FLIMSY WINDSHIELD WITH ANOTHER FLIMSY SUBARU WINDSHIELD. IF I DID NOT, NOT ONLY WOULD THEY NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SAFETY FEATURE I PAID OVER $1500 ADDITIONAL FOR WOULD WORK, BUT THEY WOULDN'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO CALIBRATE IT SHOULD IT BE NEEDED.    I HAVE SEEN OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT SUBARU WINDSHIELDS, SO THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A KNOWN ISSUE. SUBARU SHOULD WORK ON REINFORCING THEIR WINDSHIELDS AT THE VERY LEAST, ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE FORCING PEOPLE TO BUY THEM. THIS SHOULD ALSO BE INFORMATION GIVEN TO PROSPECTIVE BUYERS.",
