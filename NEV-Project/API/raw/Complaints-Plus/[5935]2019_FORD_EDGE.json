I WAS SO SHOCKED AND IT TOOK A BIT FOR US TO REALIZE WHAT HAD HAPPENED JUST IN TIME TO SEE A LARGE PIECE OF THE GLASS FLY OFF THE TOP OF MY CAR INTO THE AIR BEHIND ME.  THANK GOODNESS THERE WERE NO CARS DIRECTLY BEHIND ME.  I AM MORE THAN DISAPPOINTED IN FORD AS THEY ARE NOT STEPPING UP ON THIS ISSUE, BUT RATHER STATED THAT \"SOMETHING MUST HAVE HIT THE SUN/MOON ROOF AND WEAKENED THE GLASS SO IT IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR.  I KNOW NOTHING HIT THE GLASS AND GIVEN THAT IT HAS LESS THEN 5000 MILES ON IT, IT FEELS VERY MUCH LIKE A MANUFACTURER DEFECT  PROBLEM.  AFTER SEEING MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS I AM EVEN MORE CONVINCED THAT FORD SHOULD BE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS.  THIS WAS THE SECOND CAR I BOUGHT FROM FORD, THE FIRST WAS A 2014 ESCAPE TITANIUM (NO SUN/MOON ROOF) BUT I HAD TO HAVE THE TRANSMISSION WORKED ON 3 TIMES AND THE ENGINE ONCE IN THE FIRST YEAR.  I SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT TO FORD ON THAT AND WAS POLITELY BRUSHED OFF.  YET I GAVE THEM A SECOND CHANCE BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE THE EDGE AND THOUGHT SURELY IT COULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.  ALTHOUGH THE ISSUES AREN'T THE SAME IT IS VERY UNSETTLING TO BE HAVING ANY ISSUE WITH MY NEW CAR.  I NOW FEEL LIKE I AM STUCK WITH A CAR FOR THE NEXT 6 YEARS THAT I CAN'T TRUST.  EVERY TIME I DRIVE IT I'M WONDERING IF IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN OR WILL IT BE SOMETHING ELSE.

FOR CRIME PROTECTION FORD HAS SET, STARING WITH THE 2019 MODEL, THAT THE DOORS CANNOT BE OPENED FROM THE OUTSIDE WHEN THE MOTOR IS RUNNING IN PARKING POSITION. PREVIOUS MODELS DID NOT HAVE THE FEATURE OR THE SYSTEM COULD BE PROGRAMMED SO THAT THE DOORS WERE OPEN AS AN OCCUPANT SAFETY FEATURE. I MAKE THIS STATEMENT AS A LIFELONG SAFETY ENGINEER FIRST AT MERCEDES BENZ AND LATER AT BENDIX IN BREAKS, FOLLOWED BY 25 YEARS AT TRW IN SEAT BELTS, FIRST IN GERMANY AND LATER IN USA. I.E. I WAS HEAVILY INVOLVED WITH NHTSA FOR SEAT BELT CERTIFICATIONS AND IN THE FORD SEAT BELT BUCKLE DEVELOPMENT, NOW STANDARD IN ALL NORTH AMERICAN CARS.  I SEE THIS STEP TO LOCK THE DOORS AS A STEP AGAINST OCCUPANT SAFETY AND PROTECTION. A DRIVER, WHICH WAS ABLE TO STOP THE CAR I.E. HAVING A HEART ATTACK, CANNOT BE REACHED FROM THE OUTSIDE BY HELPERS UNTIL POLICE OR FIRE DEPARTMENT COME. THIS MIGHT BE TOO LATE IN A REMOTE AREA. ALSO PARKING IN THE GARAGE AND NEEDING TO MANUALLY UNLOCK THE VEHICLE FOR UNLOADING IS A NUISANCE.  AFTER TRYING TO HAVE THE SETTING CHANGED BY A FORD DEALER AND CONTACTING FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE ENDED 5 MONTHS LATER IN A STATEMENT FROM CUSTOMER CONTACT: YOU SHOULD HAVE ORDERED THIS OPTION. -THERE IS NOT SUCH AN OPTION AVAILABLE.  SO MY REQUEST IS AFTER ALL NOT UNREASONABLE, BUT THE DOOR LOCK SYSTEM CANNOT BE CHANGED AT A LATER POINT IN TIME. IN CONCLUSION: LOCKING THE DOORS AT ANY SPEED IS A NECESSITY BUT NOT WHEN A CAR IS IN PARK POSITION, EVEN WITH RUNNING ENGINE.
