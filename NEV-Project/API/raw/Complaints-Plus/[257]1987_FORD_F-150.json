I PULLED OVER TO CHECK AND GAS WAS LEAKING FROM BENEATH THE TRUCK . WHEN I OPENED THE FRONT TANK GAS CAP , FUEL SPEWED OUT AS IF IT WAS UNDER PRESSURE. AT THAT TIME I WAS OPERATING ON THE REAR TANK. I OPENED THE REAR GAS TANK CAP AND NOTHING HAPPENED. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS ISSUE HAS HAPPENED BEFORE AND AN EXTENDED SAFETY \" RECALL \" WAS ISSUED BY THE MANUFACTURER. IT SEEMS THE PROBLEM HAS RESURFACED AND NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH AGAIN BY \" FORD \" AS , ONCE AGAIN THE IS A SAFETY ISSUE. I BOUGHT THIS TRUCK FOR MY GRANDSONS FIRST VEHICLE AND IT ONLY HAS 114,450 MILES ON IT. I ONLY DRIVE FORD PRODUCTS.  *TR",
