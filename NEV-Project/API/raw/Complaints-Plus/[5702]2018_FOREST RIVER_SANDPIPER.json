HE NEVER TAKES ANY CHANCES.  SINCE THIS HAPPENED, WE HAVE FOUND OUT THAT ALL THE TIRES ON THE CAMPER ARE FROM CHINA.  WE ARE NOW AFRAID TO GO ON A TRIP B/C WE WONDER IF THE OTHER TIRES WILL DO THE SAME THING.  THIS IS A NEW TRAILER AND SHOULDN'T HAVE TO REPLACE ALL THE TIRES.  HAVE YOU HAD COMPLAINTS ON THIS BEFORE AND WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST WE CAN DO. THIS TIME LUCKILY WE GOT STOPPED AND  HAD A SPARE.    THE TREAD HAD WRAPPED AROUND THE FRAME OF THE TRAILER AND WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIX.",
