I BEGAN TO WORRY AS THE MATTER KEPT WORSENING AND ALREADY STILL HAD TRAUMA FROM A PRIOR ACCIDENT IN 2010 WHICH LEFT ME TO PURCHASE THIS VEHICLE IN 2011 WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD BE A MORE SAFE STABLE VEHICLE FOR ME.  UPON A FEW WEEKS LATER, WHILE TRYING TO MAKE A LEFT HAND TURN MANEUVER, THE STEERING WHEEL COMPLETELY \"LOCKED\" UP! LUCKILY, NO ONCOMING TRAFFIC WAS IN SIGHT, OTHERWISE, I WOULD HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY AS I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY! I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED THE DEALER AND EXPLAINED MY ISSUE AND NAMED THE LETTER I HAD RECEIVED A FEW MONTHS PRIOR. THUS, AN APPOINTMENT WAS SCHEDULED. I TOOK MY VEHICLE IN ON THAT SPECIFIC DAY. THE DEALER CONTACTS ME TO INFORM ME THAT THE PUMP WAS COVERED IN THE WARRANT BUT NOT THE RACK WHICH THEY SAID WAS LEAKING ON BOTH SIDES (WHICH IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PART). MY OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE OF $1200.00 AFTER LABOR AND THE ALIGNMENT!! ALL THE PARTS OF THE  POWER STEERING SYSTEM SHOULD BE PAID FOR ALL EXPENSE BY GM!! THIS IS A TREMENDOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND PEOPLES LIVES ARE AT DANGER! NO ONE HAS $1200 TO JUST DROP ON AUTO REPAIR AND I HAD TO TAKE OUT A LOAN!! WHAT IS GM WAITING FOR HUNDREDS OF DEATHS?!!  THERE'S ALREADY A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FILED GM 4-1-13. GM NEEDS TO REIMBURSE ME AND ALL OTHERS!! GM'S CEO'S NEED TO DO A MAJOR RECALL AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS. THIS IS NO JOKE AND AN EXTREME HAZARD! I'M ALSO FILING A COMPLAINT WITH GM AS WELL.  *TR",

THE RPMS DROPPED DRASTICALLY AND THE SPEEDOMETER WENT DOWN TO THE LOW 20S.  I HAD NO POWER STEERING.  I DID NOT TURN OFF THE KEY.  I ENGAGED MY EMERGENCY FLASHERS.

I TOLD MY WIFE THAT MAYBE THE ENGINE ?VAPOR? LOCKED.  WE DISCUSSED RETURNING TO FORT WORTH BUT DECIDED TO CONTINUE THINKING IT WAS A ?VAPOR? LOCK.  THE ACADIA RAN WELL TO OKLAHOMA AND BACK HOME.  IT DID NOT DO IT AFTER THAT ON THE FREEWAY.  WE NOTICED HOWEVER THAT WHEN SLOWING TO ABOUT 5-10 MPH TO ENTER OUR DRIVEWAY OR OTHER ENTRANCES, THE POWER STEERING BECAME VERY HARD AND DIFFICULT TO CONTROL ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.  THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED WAY BEFORE WE HAD EVEN HEARD OF ?IGNITION SWITCH? ISSUES.  THE IGNITION SWITCH HAS NEVER BEEN DIAGNOSED AS WE DID NOT THINK IT WAS A PROBLEM AT THE TIME.  HAD MY WIFE BEEN DRIVING BY HERSELF, SHE WOULD HAVE PANICKED IF SHE LOST POWER ON THE FREEWAY AND WAS UNABLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE TO GUIDE IT OUT OF TRAFFIC INTO A SAFE AREA FROM THE HEAVILY TRAFFIC FREEWAY.  WILL MY CAR BE IN THE RECALL FOR IGNITION SWITCH..  *TR",
