THEIR 1ST RESPONSE WAS THEY SIMPLY WOULDN'T BECAUSE I HAD IT DONE AT MY OWN PRIVATE MECHANIC. I SHOULD HAVE DRIVEN MY FUEL SMELLING VEHICLE TO CHEVY (WHOM I DO NOT HAVE A PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH) SO ONE OF THEIR MECHANICS CAN SEE IF THERE WAS IN FACT A PROBLEM FIRST. I THEN REPLIED, THAT AFTER LOOKING ONLINE I FOUND A NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE (HTTPS.//NYTI.MS/2HWDWED), DATED 10/1/12, THAT STATED THAT CHEVY WAS GOING TO ORIGINALLY SEND OUT A LETTER STATING THAT I HAD 10 YEARS OR 120,000 MILES TO HAVE PART REPLACED, BUT MY LETTER STATES ONLY UNTIL 7/31/14. THEIR VERBAL RESPONSE WAS THAT THEY SENT ME AN ADDITIONAL LETTER & MAYBE IT WENT TO THE WRONG ADDRESS (I LIVE AT MY CURRENT LOCATION FOR 46 YEARS). EITHER WAY I SHOULD HAVE DONE THE INVESTIGATING ON MY OWN TO FIND OUT ABOUT SAID LETTER (FOUND ONLINE AFTER THE FACT 12191B; DOCUMENT ID 4233868, DATED 7/8/15) WHICH BELIEVE IT OR NOT STILL STATED THAT REIMBURSEMENT REQUESTS MUST BE SUBMITTED BY 7/31/14. THEY SIMPLY TOLD MY HUSBAND THAT THEY WOULD NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT OR REIMBURSE US BECAUSE WE WENT TO OUR OWN MECHANIC WHO HAS BEEN DOING OUR VEHICLE MAINTENANCE FOR OVER 20 YEARS.",

I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE GENERAL MOTORS MIGHT COVER THIS BECAUSE OF IT BEING A MANUFACTURER DEFAULT.  THEY HAVE CONTINUED TO TELL ME THAT THEY WILL NOT PAY FOR IT BUT THEY WILL GIVE $1500 TOWARDS THE $3500 IT IS GOING TO COST TO FIX IT.  I DO NOT HAVE THIS KIND OF MONEY TO REPLACE A PART THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE WENT OUT YET.  GENERAL MOTORS ADMITS TO THERE BEING A BULLETIN OUT ON THE TRANSMISSION BUT BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A RECALL THEY WON'T FIX IT.  I LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN AND I HAVE SPOKEN WITH AT LEAST TEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME THING GO WRONG WITH THEIR GM VEHICLE.
