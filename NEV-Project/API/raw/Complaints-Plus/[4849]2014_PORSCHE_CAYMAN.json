        "summary": "Fuel tank is rubbing against the body causing visible rub marks on the plastic tank itself. This is caused by foam pads either being misplaced or not installed at all from the factory. Porsche themselves have a TSB on it (SB-1403), but they will not handle the fix outside of warranty. This seems like a major safety issue where a plastic component holding flammable fuel is rubbing against the metal body and causing a potential failure point where fuel can leak onto hot components. Porsche has stated this is not a safety issue, but I cannot see how that is possibly the case. Many others online are facing the same issue and are getting quotes of $2k USD for the fix to be carried out. Please look into this as I do not feel safe driving my car knowing that the fuel tank can rub itself to failure at any point.",

A LARGE NUMBER OF 981 OWNERS WITH MANUAL TRANSMISSION REPORTED SIMILAR EXPERIENCE AS CAN BE SEEN IN THIS PORSCHE 981 FORUM HTTP://WWW.PLANET-9.COM/981-CHAT/90509-ACCIDENTALLY-SELECTED-REVERSE-STOPLIGHT.HTML    THE PROBLEM HAPPENS AS A RESULT OF TWO DESIGN ISSUES WITH THIS CAR MODE:  1. THERE IS NO MECHANICAL BLOCK THAT PREVENTS SHIFTING INTO THE REVERSE GEAR WHEN INTENDING TO SHIFT INTO FIRST GEAR (E.G. BY REQUIRING TO PRESS THE STICK SHIFT DOWN TO ENGAGE THE REVERSE GEAR)   2. THE CAR HAS AN ELECTRONIC GEAR INDICATOR BUT IT STAYS BLANK WHEN THE CAR STOPS AND DISPLAYS THE ENGAGED GEAR ONLY WHEN THE CAR STARTED TO MOVE AND ACHIEVED A CERTAIN SPEED, WHICH IS TOO LATE.
