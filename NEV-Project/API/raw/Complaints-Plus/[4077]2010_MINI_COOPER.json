        "summary": "AFTER RECEIVING ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE FOR A BATTERY ISSUE I WAS DRIVING HOME AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AT NIGHT WHEN THE INTERIOR LIGHTING OF MY DASHBOARD WENT OUT AND MY INSTRUMENT CLUSTER, TURN SIGNALS, FOG LIGHTS, HIGH BEAMS, AND WINDOWS CEASED TO FUNCTION. WHEN I MADE IT HOME I SCANNED MY VEHICLE VIA OBD2 AND A PLETHORA OF CODES HAD APPEARED  ALMOST ALL RELATED TO SAFETY FEATURES SUCH AS LIGHTING, AIRBAGS,DYNAMIC STABILITY CONTROL, SUSPENSION, ABS, AND SPEED SENSING DEVICES. AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF RESEARCH AND DIAGNOSTIC WORK  I DETERMINED THE PROBLEM TO BE THE DRIVER SIDE FOOTWELL MODULE WHICH HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN TO BE A DEFECTIVE ITEM TO MINI/BMW SO MUCH SO THAT IT'S BEEN GIVEN A WARRANTY EXTENSION OF 10 YEARS/ 156,000 MILES THAT REMAINS ACTIVE, BUT ONLY TO ELIGIBLE VEHICLE WARRANTY HOLDERS. AFTER MY EXPERIENCE OF LOSING PRACTICALLY ALL VEHICLE LIGHTING WHICH INCLUDED BOTH TURN AND HAZARD SIGNALING ABILITY WHILE DRIVING AT NIGHT AND AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS I IMPLORE THE NHTSA TO ISSUE A SAFETY RECALL ON THESE FAULTY FOOTWELL MODULES GIVEN THE EASE AND SUDDENNESS AT WHICH THEY CEASE TO FUNCTION FOR REASONS THAT RANGE FROM MOISTURE INTOLERANCE, ROUTINE MAINTENANCE PRACTICES, AND EMERGENCY ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AS WAS MY PARTICULAR CASE. THE PROBLEM HAS ALREADY BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE MANUFACTURER AND I FEEL IT IS NOW TIME THAT THE GOVERNMENT ADDRESS THIS KNOWN SAFETY ISSUE IN ORDER TO PROTECT AMERICA'S ROADS AND HIGHWAYS AS WELL AS THE CITIZENRY AT LARGE.",

FIRST ISSUE I HAVE IS HOW DOES A TIMING BELT LAST ONLY 70K MILES ON A SUPPOSED HIGH-END, HIGH-PERFORMANCE VEHICLE LIKE MINI/BMW?  EVERY OTHER VEHICLE I HAVE EVER OWNED (FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC) RECOMMENDS CHANGING TIMING BELT AROUND 100K MILES, SO THE THOUGHT OF CHANGING A TIMING CHAIN WAS FOR AT LEAST 20K MORE MILES NEVER CROSSED MY MIND.  SECOND ISSUE IS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT HAS BEEN AWARDED TO MINI COOPER OWNERS (SAME MAKE AND MODEL) ON OR ABOUT 2010 FOR THIS VERY PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, MINI COOPER CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND THE ONLY LOCAL MINI COOPER SERVICE CENTER IN SAN ANTONIO TEXAS HAS INFORMED ME THAT MY VIN # WAS NOT AFFECTED BY THIS SETTLEMENT...EVEN THOUGH THE CAUSE AND AFFECT OF THE TIMING CHAIN FAILURE IS EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM MY MINI COOPER EXPERIENCED WITH ONLY 70K MILES.  *TR",

I HAVE DRIVEN THIS VEHICLE FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS WITHOUT ONE MECHANICAL ISSUE.  TODAY I HAVE APPROXIMATELY 41,000 MILES ON THE CAR.  ON THE EVENING OF FEBRUARY 16, 2015, I STARTED MY CAR TO LEAVE MY PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT AND A LOW OIL INDICATOR LIGHT FLASHED.  LIVING IN A COLD WEATHER CLIMATE, I THOUGHT THE ENGINE NEEDED TIME TO WARM UP.  AFTER LETTING THE CAR WARM UP, I ATTEMPTED TO LEAVE THE PARKING LOT AND THE CAR FAILED AS I WAS ABOUT TO MAKE A TURN ONTO A MAIN ROAD.    MY HUSBAND HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A LOCAL MINI SPECIALIST WHERE WE WERE TOLD THE CAR WAS EXTREMELY LOW ON OIL DUE AN INTERNAL LEAK COMING FROM THE TIMING CHAIN TENSIONER SEAL.  WE WERE TOLD THE LEAK HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR A WHILE; HOWEVER, THE FIRST INDICATION OF LOW OIL WAS ONLY MINUTES BEFORE THE CAR FAILED.  THE CAR HAD BEEN TO A LOCAL MINI DEALERSHIP FOR REGULAR SERVICE LESS THAN A YEAR AGO. IN ADDITION THE MECHANIC FOUND COOLANT IN THE CYLINDERS AND IS UNSURE OF HOW THIS OCCURRED.  THE MECHANIC FEELS IT COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A CRACKED ENGINE BLOCK OR CRACKED CYLINDER HEAD.  ADDITIONAL TESTING WOULD NEED TO BE DONE ON THESE PARTS TO CONFIRM.  AT THIS TIME, MY HUSBAND AND I ARE BEING TOLD THAT THE ENTIRE ENGINE NEEDS TO REPLACED ON A CAR THAT ONLY HAD 40,000 MILES ON IT.  THE ESTIMATED COST WE RECEIVED WAS $10,315.  THIS IS A TOUGH PILL TO SWALLOW CONSIDERING IT IS A \"YOUNG CAR,\" IN OUR MINDS.  WITH ALL OF THE ISSUES FOUND BY THE MECHANIC IT SEEMS AS IF THIS CAR HAD A FAULTY ENGINE FROM THE START.  I HAVE CONTACTED MINI USA REGARDING THIS ISSUE AND HOPE THEY STAND BEHIND THEIR VEHICLES.  *TR",
