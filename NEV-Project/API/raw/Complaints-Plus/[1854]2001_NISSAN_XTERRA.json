HOWEVER, SINCE THE DAY I BOUGHT THE XTERRA I HAVE KNOWN I COULD NOT WALK AWAY WHILE PUTTING GAS IN THE TANK BECAUSE THE GAS DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY SHUT-OFF.  RATHER, IT WILL SPILL OUT.  I JUST LIVED WITH THIS, FIGURING IT WAS A \"KINK\" I WOULD HAVE TO LIVE WITH.  UNTIL I WAS ON THE NISSAN WEBSITE & SAW THEY HAD A RECALL ON 2001 XTERRAS FOR THIS EXACT ISSUE.  ONLY ONE PROBLEM, THE VIN FOR MY XTERRA IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  WHILE MY XTERRA WAS AT THE VICTORY NISSAN OF RICHMOND (MAR 2004), FOR A DIFFERENT ISSUE, I LET BOTH TIM, SERVICE TECH, & GARY, SERVICE MANAGER, KNOW MY XTERRA DID THE SAME THING THE RECALL WAS DESCRIBING.  THEY SAID MY XTERRA WAS NOT A PART OF THE RECALL, BUT WOULD FOLLOW UP WITH NISSAN.  I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM VICTORY NISSAN.  MAY 14, 2004, I NOTIFIED NISSAN HDQTRS ABOUT THE ISSUE & WAS TOLD I WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE MY XTERRA DIAGNOSED.  MY COMPLAINT IS NISSAN IS AWARE THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE FUEL TANK VALVE ON 2001 XTERRAS & I AM TELLING THEM MY 2001 XTERRA DOES THE SAME THING, BUT THEY SAID I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM TO DIAGNOSE MY XTERRA.  CONSIDERING THE HUGE SAFETY ISSUES WITH FILLING UP A GAS TANK & IT NOT AUTOMATICALLY STOPPING, BUT RATHER SPILLING GAS, I FIND IT ABSURD NISSAN WOULD EXPECT A CUSTOMER TO PAY $40 TO $80 TO DIAGNOSE IF THE VALVE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  ESPECIALLY ON A MODEL KNOWN TO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH ITS FUEL TANK VALVES.  MY OTHER CONCERN IS IF MY 2001 XTERRA IS DOING THE SAME THING AS IN THE RECALL & WAS NOT A PART OF THE RECALL, HOW MANY OTHER 2001 XTERRAS ARE OUT THERE JUST WAITING TO HAVE A SPARK AT THE GAS PUMP BEFORE ACTION IS TAKEN.  ALSO, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT MY 2001 XTERRA'S ISSUE IS THE FUEL TANK VALVE OR NOT, THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN & I WOULD THINK NISSAN WOULD WANT TO IDENTIFY IF THERE WERE OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE GAS TANKS OF XTERRAS.

A CAR TRAVELING WEST BOUND TURNED IN FRONT OF US, WE HIT THE CAR AND THE HIT A STOP LIGHT POLE.  WE CONTACTED NISSAN, AND THEY SENT US A LETTER STATING THAT WE DID NOT DECELERATE QUICK ENOUGH.  GOING 40MPH AND HITTING A CAR AND THEN A LIGHT POLE, HOW CAN THAT NOT BE A QUICK ENOUGH DECELERATION?  MY VEHICLE WAS TOTALED, AND ALL OF THE DAMAGE WAS IN THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE, WITH THE LIGHT POLE RESTING IN THE CENTER OF THE HOOD.  EVERYONE AT THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT STATED THAT THE AIRBAGS SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED.  THE POLICE, FIRE DEPT., AND AMBULANCE WOULDN'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO GET ME OUT OF THE VEHICLE UNTIL THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FOR FEAR THAT THE BAGS WOULD DEPLOY IN ATTEMPT TO GET ME OUT.  I WANT TO KNOW WHY THEY DIDN'T DEPLOY, AND I WANT SOMETHING DONE ABOUT IT.
