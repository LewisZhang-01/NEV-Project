Lane Keeping Assist did not alarm. To prevent it from hitting the left divider, I tried to steer back to the right but the steering wheel was locked up. I pressed the brake pedal, but the car did not slow down. The car suddenly slid to the far right, left the highway pavement, rolled over on the lawn. All of the front and side airbags on the driver\u2019s seat and co-driver\u2019s seat popped out. Smoke was everywhere. I got bruises on my knees and legs, and cuts in left hand and arm.

WHILE TEST DRIVING THE CAR, I NOTICED A HAZINESS TO THE WINDSHIELD WHEN DRIVING DIRECTLY INTO THE SUN. I WAS TOLD BY A HYUNDAI SALESMAN, [XXX] THAT THIS HAZINESS MIGHT BE DIRT AND THAT THE DEALERSHIP WOULD WASH THE CAR BEFORE I TOOK IT HOME THUS TAKING CARE OF THE PROBLEM. LATER, AFTER A CAREFUL EXAMINATION, I OBSERVED THAT THE WINDSHIELD HAD A SPECKLE DEFECT CAUSING MASSIVE SCATTERING AND HAZINESS OF MY FIELD OF VISION WHEN DRIVING DIRECTLY INTO THE SUN, A FREQUENT DRIVING CONDITION HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I ALSO OBSERVED THAT THIS DEFECT EXISTS IN ALL SIX CAR WINDOWS (FRONT WINDSHIELD, FOUR SIDE WINDOWS AND BACK WINDSHIELD). THIS DEFECT IS PARTICULARLY NOTICEABLE SINCE I COMMUTE EARLY MORNINGS AND EVENINGS, TIMES WHEN THE SUN IS LOW AND DIRECTLY IN MY FIELD OF VISION.   I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS MANUFACTURING DEFECT IMPAIRS THE DRIVABILITY OF THE CAR AND IS A CONSIDERABLE RISK TO MY PERSONAL SAFETY. IT IS HARD FOR ME TO DETERMINE IF THIS DEFECT MIGHT NOT ALSO BE CAUSING A MECHANICAL DEGRADATION OF THE WINDSHIELD'S STRENGTH.   ON JANUARY 24, 2020, I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND MET WITH [XXX], THE SALES MANAGER. DURING THIS MEETING THE HYUNDAI REPRESENTATIVE EASILY DETECTED AND CONFIRMED THE WINDOWS' DEFECT.
