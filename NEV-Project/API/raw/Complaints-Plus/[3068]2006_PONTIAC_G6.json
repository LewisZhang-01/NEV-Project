THERE WAS A CAR BEHIND ME AND CARS ON THE ROAD QUICKLY APPROACHING.  I WAS A SITTING DUCK WITH MY FRONT BUMPER HALF WAY INTO THE STREET WITH NOWHERE TO GO AND ZERO STEERING POWER TO TURN THE WHEEL.  IT WAS TERRIFYING! LUCKILY, WITH HELP OF STRANGERS WE WERE ABLE TO GET BACK INTO THE PARKING LOT WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.

ON OCTOBER 29, 2018, THE VERY SAME PART THAT HAD BEEN REPLACED IN THE RECALL FAILED AGAIN, PULLING MY HUSBAND INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC AS HE WAS RETURNING HOME FROM WORK. FORTUNATELY, HE AVOIDED CAUSING AN ACCIDENT.   WE HAVE TALKED WITH TWO DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS, THE ONE THAT DID THE ORIGINAL RECALL REPAIR, AND ONE WE TRUSTED TO BETTER DEAL WITH THE ISSUE, AND ALSO WITH GM, WHO I FIRST TAGGED IN A TWEET, THEN THROUGH MESSAGING ON TWITTER. THEY OPENED CASE #8-4778293416. I HAD SOME MEDICAL WORK DONE RECENTLY, SO THE WORK HAS HAD TO BE PUT OFF LONGER THAN WE PREFER, BUT ONCE WE TOOK THE CAR TO DINSDALE CHEVROLET IN GRAND ISLAND, NEBRASKA, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE VERY SAME PART THAT WAS REPLACED PER THE RECALL WAS WHAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AGAIN, AND IT WILL COST US $715 TO GET THE REPAIR.   WE HAVE RESEARCHED ONLINE, AND LEARNED THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE ALSO HAD THE RECALL DONE PROPERLY, AND HAD THE PART FAIL AGAIN, ONLY TO LEARN THAT GM WILL NOT HONOR THE RECALL A SECOND TIME.  NOW, IF THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM THAT REQUIRED A RECALL, BUT THE 'FIX' IS ONLY TEMPORARY, THEY ARE NOT REALLY 'FIXING' THE PROBLEM, ARE THEY? THAT'S LIKE MORE OF A BANDAGE, NOT A REPAIR, IF YOU ASK ME, AND EVERY OTHER PERSON WHO HAS BEEN PLACED INTO A POTENTIALLY HIGHLY DANGEROUS SITUATION. IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO FIND OUT WHETHER PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES AS A RESULT OF THIS 'TEMPORARY' REPAIR. I'M ANGRY THAT GM IS MAKING A CONSCIOUS CHOICE TO NOT HONOR THIS RECALL REPAIR, AND I FEEL THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR A FAILURE OF ONE OF THEIR PARTS, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT WAS ALREADY FOUND TO HAVE A DEFECT.

I ASKED WHAT THE DIFFERENCE WAS BETWEEN MY STEERING MODULE AND THE ONES ON RECALL WERE, AND HE STATED THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS THE PART NUMBER AND IT WAS THE SAME EXACT PART. SO FOR $900.00 TO FIX IT I TOLD THEM TO TOW IT BACK TO MY HOUSE UNFIXED AND NOW THE CAR SITS UNUSED BECAUSE I REFUSE TO PAY FOR A PART THAT IS KNOWINGLY UNSAFE AND FAULTY BY THE MANUFACTURER . THE OUTCOME OF THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE HAD I BEEN ON A BUSY ROAD. DID I MENTION MY SON WAS IN THE CAR WITH ME AS WELL?  I HAVE THE INVOICE FROM THE DEALER BUT DONT HAVE A SCANNER.",

MY CAR STEERED FINE WITH NO ISSUES BUT THE LIGHT CAME AND I RECEIVED THIS RECALL.  IT HAS NEVER BEEN RIGHT SINCE AND A KNOCK AFTER TURNING IS NOT NORMAL.  WITH THE CAR SITTING IN PARK, TURN THE WHEEL RIGHT OR LEFT, IT KNOCKS WHEN YOU LET THE WHEEL GO.  I FEAR THIS COULD BE UNSAFE AND DO TO A FAULTY REPLACED PART FROM A RECALL.    *TR",

TOOK IT TO THOMPSON'S PLACERVILLE, ACTED LIKE I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO WORK A CRUISE CONTROL.  CONTINUED TO HAVE ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS THROUGHOUT THE VEHICLE.  SPOKE WITH DAVID O'KEEF, PONTIAC CUSTOMER SERVICE (866) 790-5600, EXT 31952, REGARDING LEMON LAW. I TOOK THE VEHICLE INTO THOMPSONS ON THE FOLLOWING DATES (THERE WERE SEVERAL MORE, BUT I DID NOT RECEIVE AN INVOICE FROM THE DEALER):  7/11/07; 8/10/07; 10/05/07; 10/8/07; 10/20/07; 11/16/07; 12/12/07; 4/8/08; 4/23/08 5/14/08; 5/16/08; 5/31/08; 11/11/08; THROUGHOUT 2009 AND 2010; 4/28/11; 9/6/11; 9/14/11; 12/9/11; AND 12/14/11.  PULLED OVER BY CHP SEVERAL TIMES FOR BRAKE LIGHTS BEING ON, BUT I WAS NOT BRAKING, OFFICER STATED VEHICLE TOO DANGEROUS TO BE ON ROAD.  ON 9/6/11, A FRIEND REFERRED ME TO MOTORTREND RECALLS.  RECALL DATE FOR AIR BAGS WAS 10/31/2006 AND EXTERIOR LIGHTING: BRAKE LIGHTS 1/30/2009.  STEERING NEEDED TO BE REPLACED IN 2009.  I WAS NEVER CONTACTED BY GM OR RELIABLE PONTIAC.  VEHICLE WAS A COSTLY, SAFETY HAZARD THROUGH 12/14/11.  STILL HAVE ISSUES.  EXTREMELY INCONVENIENT TO KEEP TAKING IT TO THE DEALER.

DURING THIS PERIOD THE CRIMPS MAY BE ASYMMETRICAL, RESULTING IN INADEQUATE PRESSURE ON THE WIRE THAT CAN LEAD TO ELECTRICAL NOISE IN THE SIGNAL FROM THE SENSOR TO THE CONTROLLER.

I HAVE CONDUCTED RESEARCH ONLINE TO SEE IF THIS HAS HAPPENED TO OTHER DRIVERS, DRIVING A PONTIAC VEHICLE AND IT HAS HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES. I BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THE POWER STEERING WITHIN THIS VEHICLE AND I URGE THE NHTSA TO FOLLOW UP AGAIN ON THEIR INVESTIGATION A FEW YEARS AGO AND DEMAND A RECALL ON THE POWER STEERING FOR THIS MODEL AND YEAR. CONSIDERING THE POWER STEERING WAS BUILT INTO THE TRANSMISSION, THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT CAN'T JUST BE FIXED BY ADDING POWER STEERING FLUID. IF THE NHTSA DOES NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM AND ISSUE A POSSIBLE RECALL, THERE WILL BE MORE ACCIDENTS AND SOME MAY END UP FATAL.   *TR",

SINCE THAT ORIGINAL FIX, I HAVE HAD THE BRAKE MODULE CHANGED THREE OR FOUR TIMES, TAKEN TO TWO SEVERAL DEALERSHIPS AND ALSO TO A TRUSTED MECHANIC. NO ONE CAN GET THE PROBLEM CORRECTED.

THE BRAKE LAMPS MAY NOT OPERATE PROPERLY BECAUSE OF CORROSION IN A WIRING CONNECTOR. CORROSION IN THE CONNECTOR COULD CAUSE THE BRAKE LAMPS TO ILLUMINATE WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL HAS NOT BEEN DEPRESSED, OR THE LAMPS MAY NOT ILLUMINATE WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL IS DEPRESSED. IN ADDITION, THE CRUISE CONTROL MAY NOT ENGAGE, AND GREATER BRAKE PEDAL FORCE MAY BE REQUIRED TO SHIFT THE VEHICLE OUT OF PARK.  CONSEQUENCE: BRAKE LAMPS THAT ARE NOT OPERATING PROPERLY MAY NOT WARN A DRIVER IN A FOLLOWING VEHICLE OF THE BRAKING STATUS AND COULD LEAD TO A CRASH WITHOUT PRIOR WARNING.  FIX: DEALERS WILL APPLY A DIELECTRIC LUBRICANT TO THE CONNECTOR TO PREVENT CORROSION.  THE RECALL BEGAN ON FEBRUARY 17, 2009.   *TR",

STILL LEAKED FLUID. MY HUSBAND AFTER GETTING THE CAR BACK FROM THE REPAIR SHOP FOUND THE LEAK AND BOUGHT A PART AND FIXED IT HIMSELF. PRETTY GOOD AFTER 3 RADIATORS AND ALL THE TECHS WORKING ON IT OVER THE 6 YRS, HE HAD TO FIX IT. IT HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP RIGHT AFTER I GOT IT BECAUSE WHEN YOU WOULD TAKE OFF, IT WOULD ACT LIKE IT SKIPPED A GEAR. BUT IF I SHIFTED W/THE STANDARD SHIFT IT WOULDN'T DO IT. THEY SAID THERE WAS NO SHAVINGS IN THE TRANSMISSION TRAY AND ALL WAS FINE. TOOK IT BACK AGAIN FOR THE SAME THING, THEY STILL SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE TRANSMISSION. BUT TO THIS DAY ABOUT ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK IT WILL STILL SKIP WHEN ACCELERATING. I HAVE HAD THE MOTOR ON THE CONVERTIBLE REPLACED RIGHT AFTER I GOT IT. THE STEREO WAS ALSO REPLACED. THE PASSENGER SIDE CHAIR ARM RELEASE, THAT ALLOWS YOU TO LET THE SEAT UP FOR SOMEONE TO GET IN THE BACK CAME OFF, THEY PUT ANOTHER ONE ON AND NO ADHESIVE IT STRIPPED OUT AGAIN. REFUSED TO FIX IT. I HAVE ALL PAPERWORK FROM ALL THE REPAIRS IT HAS HAD,WILL LIST IN ANOTHERPOST.  *TR",

THE BRAKE LAMPS MAY NOT OPERATE PROPERLY BECAUSE OF CORROSION IN A WIRING CONNECTOR. CORROSION IN THE CONNECTOR COULD CAUSE THE BRAKE LAMPS TO ILLUMINATE WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL HAS NOT BEEN DEPRESSED, OR THE LAMPS MAY NOT ILLUMINATE WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL IS DEPRESSED. IN ADDITION, THE CRUISE CONTROL MAY NOT ENGAGE, AND GREATER BRAKE PEDAL FORCE MAY BE REQUIRED TO SHIFT THE VEHICLE OUT OF PARK.   CONSEQUENCE:   BRAKE LAMPS THAT ARE NOT OPERATING PROPERLY MAY NOT WARN A DRIVER IN A FOLLOWING VEHICLE OF THE BRAKING STATUS AND COULD LEAD TO A CRASH WITHOUT PRIOR WARNING.   REMEDY:   DEALERS WILL APPLY A DIELECTRIC LUBRICANT TO THE CONNECTOR TO PREVENT CORROSION. THIS SERVICE WILL BE PERFORMED FOR YOU FREE OF CHARGE. THE RECALL BEGAN ON FEBRUARY 17, 2009.

AFTER OUR VISITORS LEFT, IT WASN'T UNTIL MID AUGUST THAT THE CAR ENDED UP IN THE GARAGE; AGAIN THE INTENSE SMELL OF FUEL WAS PRESENT IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.... IT WAS AT THAT TIME THAT WE DISCOVERED IT WAS THE CAR. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND IRONICALLY, THE MAN AHEAD OF ME ( WITH A PONTIAC G6 ) WAS BRINGING HIS CAR IN FOR AND INTENSE FUEL SMELL COMING FROM HIS CAR. I LEFT THE CAR WITH THE DEALER AND CHECKED ONLINE FOR ANY SERVICE BULLETINS ON THE VEHICLE. I DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS. IN FACT, A SERVICE BULLETIN ISSUED IN THE PONTIAC G6 FOR CRACKED FUEL PUMPS,  AND THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY THE DEALER.        IN THE END, I HAD TO PAY $291.01 TO REPAIR THE FUEL PUMP ON A CAR WITH ONLY 41000 MILES  - (  GM SAYS THEY SPLIT THE BILL  50/50 IN GOOD FAITH. ) I WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS WILL END UP BEING A RECALL IN THE COMING YEAR BECAUSE SOMEONE WILL BE INJURED OR KILLED BY IGNORING THIS PROBLEM...

THIS HAS ALSO ALMOST CAUSED MANY ACCIDENTS, AS IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO PULL IN AND OUT OF PARKING SPACES.

THIS IS A SERIOUS AND VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM CONSIDERING THE STEERING WHEEL OF THE CAR LOCKS COMPLETELY AND WILL NOT TURN WHILE DRIVING IT.

FIRST THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE PAINT ON THE CAR, IT LOOKED LIKE WATER SPOTS. I TOOK IT IN TO THE DEALER 2WEEKS AFTER I BOUGHT IT. AFTER MANY ATTEMPTS THEY WERE ABLE TO GET THE SPOTS OFF BUT THEY HAVE SLOWLY CAME BACK. SECOND MY  SPEAKERS BLEW AFTER 1 MONTH OF HAVING MY CAR. THEY WERE REPLACED. THIRD, MY TWO FRONT LIGHTS MUST OF HAD TINY HOLES BECAUSE THEY WOULD GET REALLY FOGGY AFTER TAKING MY CAR TO THE CARWASH. THEY HAD TO BE REPLACED ALSO. FOURTH TIME I RECEIVED A LETTER FOR A RECALL DUE TO A BAD MOUNTING OF THE SUNROOF HOSE. IT STAINED MY HEADLINER AND HAD TO BE REPLACED. I HAD TO TAKE MY CAR BACK LIKE 3 TIMES BECAUSE AFTER REPLACING THE HEADLINER THEY APPARENTLY DIDN'T PUT THINGS BACK HOW THEY SHOULD THEREFORE ON RAINY DAYS THE WATER WOULD COME INSIDE MY CAR THROUGH VARIOUS PLACES. FINALLY THEY GOT IT RIGHT AND IT WAS RAIN FREE INSIDE MY VEHICLE. FIFTH, MY TRANSMISSION GAVE OUT ON ME TWICE. SIX, WHEN I TURN MY WHEEL IT MAKES THIS HORRIBLE POPPING NOISE, VERY IRRITATING. SEVENTH, MY ABOUT A MONTH NOW MY CAR HAD BEEN SMELLING ALOT LIKE GAS, NOT TO MENTION I HAVE A 2YR OLD AND A 7MONTH OLD THAT ARE ALWAYS IN THE CAR. I REGRET BUYING THIS VEHICLE AND I'M VERY CONCERNED FOR MY FAMILY AND MYSELF! THERE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE A RECALL ON THIS GAS PROBLEM.

AFTER LOOKING INTO FIXING THE ISSUE AND SEEING ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS VERY SAME ISSUE WITH THE PONTIAC G6 AND LEARNING THAT GM HAS DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT...I AM WONDERING HOW MUCH MONEY THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY WHEN SOMEONE SUES THEM BECAUSE OF A FATAL ACCIDENT  THAT WAS CAUSED BY A KNOWN ISSUE.  THIS POWER STEERING ISSUE WAS ALSO A PROBLEM ON THE PONTIAC G5 ACCORDING TO REPORTS AND THE G5 HAS BEEN RECALLED.  IS IT GOING TO TAKE MULTIPLE FATALITIES FOR THIS CAR TO BE RECALLED?  I CAN ONLY PRAY THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN  TO ME OR ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER.  IT IS OBVIOUS HOW DANGEROUS THIS ISSUE CAN BE WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING AND THE CAR JUST DOES THIS OUT OF NOWHERE.  THEN WHEN YOU GET IN THE CAR TO SHOW SOMEONE ELSE IT DOES NOT DO IT.  A PERSON CAN NEVER PREDICT WHEN THIS MIGHT HAPPEN AS THERE ARE NO WARNINGS OR SYMPTOMS BEFORE IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.  DANGEROUS AND LIFE THREATENING.  I WILL NOT LET MY CHILD RIDE IN THIS CAR ANYMORE BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM.  I BOUGHT THIS CAR BECAUSE IT WAS NOT FOREIGN AND I WANT TO SUPPORT PRODUCTS MADE IN THE USA.  NEXT TIME I WILL THINK TWICE ABOUT THAT ESPECIALLY IF MY LIFE WILL BE IN DANGER EVERYTIME I GET INTO THE CAR.  GM YOU REALLY NEED TO DO RIGHT BY YOUR CONSUMERS AND RECALL THIS CAR BEFORE MULTIPLE LIVES ARE TAKEN OR CHANGED FOREVER BECAUSE OF PERMANENT INJURIES DUE TO A MALFUNCTIONING OF THE CAR.  THIS IS ONE OF THE SCARIEST FEELINGS EVER NOT KNOWING WHEN THE POWER STEERING WILL GO OUT.  WHERE WILL I BE NEXT TIME AND WILL I BE ABLE TO TURN THE CAR OR GET OFF THE ROAD BEFORE GETTING INTO AN ACCIDENT? *TR",

I TOOK THE CAR INTO A CHEVY DEALERSHIP (SINCE PONTIAC IS NO MORE) WHERE UPON INSPECTION THEY STATED THAT MY INTERMEDIATE STEERING SHAFT WAS FAULTY BUT 'FIXABLE\".  THE PART WAS TAKEN OUT, CLEANED, LUBED UP, AND PLACED BACK INTO THE CAR ACCORDING TO THE TECHNICIAN.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE PROBLEM WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN AS I WAS LEAVING THE DEALERSHIP.  PARTLY DUE TO BEING IN A RUSH, I DIDN'T QUESTION THIS BUT BROUGHT IT UP TO MY BOYFRIEND WHO THEN CALLED THE DEALERSHIP FOR CLARIFICATION.  TURNS OUT THERE IS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FOR THIS PARTICULAR COMPONENT IN THE CAR.      WHY ISN'T THIS BEING ADDRESSED BY THE MEDIA/TO THE PONTIAC OWNERS?!!? LOOKING ONLINE MANY OTHERS HAVE THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE SAME CAR/SAME YEAR! I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE THE ISSUES WHILE DRIVING SHORT DISTANCES BUT WHAT IF I WAS IN THE CAR ON THE HIGHWAY AND THIS HAPPENED?! I'M A TINY 100 LB GIRL - THERE WOULD BE NO CHANCE OF ME CONTROLLING A CAR LIKE THAT FOR A LENGTH OF TIME WITHOUT POWER STEERING/PROPERLY WORKING VEHICLE.

I TURNED OFF MY CAR AND RESTARTED IT, IT WAS FINE, I MADE IT TO THE NEXT STOP LIGHT AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED. THIS HAPPENED A TOTAL OF FOUR TIMES BEFORE I MADE IT TO A PEP BOYS AUTO STORE, TURNED OFF MY CAR, LOOKED AT THE DRIVERS MANUAL WHERE IT SHOWED A PICTURE OF THE POWER STEERING CAP AND ANOTHER PICTURE OF WHERE IT WAS LOCATED UNDER THE HOOD. I WENT INSIDE PURCHASED A BOTTLE OF POWER STEERING FLUID, CAME BACK OUT, LIFTED THE HOOD OF MY 2006 PONTIAC G6 AND COULDN'T FIND THE POWER STEERING FLUID RESERVOIR. I ASKED FOR HELP, THE GENTLEMAN WHO HELP ME LOOKED FOR THIS POWER STEERING RESERVOIR, COULDN'T FIND IT AND ADVISED THAT I TAKE IT TO THE DEALER.  *TR",

I  FOUND THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL #06V417000, FOR THE 2006 G6 FOR AIRBAG FAILURE.  I CONTACTED  GM AND ADVISED OF THE AIRBAG PROBLEM.  UPON CONTACT WITH GM, I WAS ASSIGNED A CASE# 71-775-755-730. I EXPRESSED MY CONCERN THAT THIS COULD BE A SAFETY DEFECT THAT COULD MEAN THE AIRBAG COULD MALFUNCTION DURING AN ACCIDENT.  GM ADVISED ME TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALERSHIP.  I ADVISED GM OF THE SCHEDULED SERVICE APPOINTMENT.  AFTER THE SERVICE APPOINTMENT, THE DEALERSHIP STATED THEY WOULD BE IN TOUCH WITH THE GENERAL MANAGER OF GM AND GIVE ME A CALL BACK.

AFTER NOT RECEIVING A CALL FROM THE DEALERSHIP IN A COUPLE OF DAYS, I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS ADVISED THAT GM WOULD NOT REPAIR MY CAR BECAUSE IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND I WAS THE SECOND OWNER.

ALTHOUGH, THERE ARE 70,000 MILES ON THE CAR, IF THIS IS A MANUFACTURER'S SAFETY DEFECT IT SHOULD BE REPAIRED REGARDLESS OF THE MILES ON THE VEHICLE.  THE DEALERSHIP ADVISED THE AIRBAG WOULD NOT DEPLOY IF THERE IS AN ACCIDENT. GM ASSIGNED THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT.  I MADE NUMEROUS CALLS AND FINALLY RECEIVED A CALL BACK LAST WEEK.  I WAS TOLD THAT GM WAS NOT GOING TO REPAIR MY CAR.  I EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS AGAIN ABOUT THE MANUFACTURER'S SAFETY DEFECT.

I AM THEREFORE REQUESTING THAT NHTSA REQUIRE GM TO COVER THE COST OF NEEDED REPAIRS FOR ANY GM VEHICLE THAT HAS THIS PROBLEM. AS NOTED IN THE RECALL NOTICE, \"BRAKE LAMPS THAT ARE NOT OPERATING PROPERLY MAY NOT WARN A DRIVER IN A FOLLOWING VEHICLE OF THE BRAKING STATUS AND COULD LEAD TO A CRASH WITHOUT PRIOR WARNING\". THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND I FIND IT UNACCEPTABLE THAT GM WOULD NOT REPAIR, AT THEIR EXPENSE, ANY VEHICLE WITH THIS PROBLEM.  THANK YOU.       INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6). *TR",

THE MAIN ISSUE IS A CLUNKING NOISE IN THE STEERING WHEN MAKING A TURN IN ANY DIRECTION. THE 1ST TIME IT HAPPENED I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE GEAR BOX AND HAD THAT REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY, AND 6MTHS LATER THE EXACT NOISE IS BACK AND MY VEHICLE BACK IN THE DEALERSHIP. WELL THIS TIME IT'S NOT THE GEAR BOX IT'S THE SHAFT THAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND IT'S NOT COVERED. GO FIGURE! MY NEXT QUESTION TO THE DEALER IS HOW IS IT THAT MY CAR IS MAKING THE SAME NOISE IT WAS MAKING 6MTHS AGO FROM THE EXACT SAME AREA AND IT'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT NOW AND NOT COVERED BY THE WARRANTY? HOW DO I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE COMPETENT WORKERS AND THEIR REPAIRING WHAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED? OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T BE HERE IN THIS DEALERSHIP EVERY 6MTHS LIKE IM ON THE PAYROLL.

APPROXIMATELY 6 MONTHS LATER, I BEGAN HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE POWER STEERING. THERE WERE INSTANCES WHILE TRAVELING ON THE ROAD THAT THE CAR WOULD MOMENTARILY LOSE THE POWER STEERING CAPABILITY AND THEREIN MAKES THE VEHICLE DIFFICULT TO TURN.   I WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT ON JUNE 28, 2007. WHILE ATTEMPTING TO MAKE A LANE CHANGE THE VEHICLE?S STEERING WHEEL BECAME VERY DIFFICULT TO TURN AND LOSS POWER STEERING AND IT RESULTED IN ME BEING STRUCK ON THE PASSENGER SIDE BY ANOTHER VEHICLE. THERE WERE NO INJURIES. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED AND IT SEEMED AS I SIMPLY VIEWED IT AS ONE OF THOSE UNEXPLAINABLE INSTANCES.   ON DECEMBER 25, 2007, CHRISTMAS DAY THE VEHICLE AGAIN HAD A MOMENTARY LOSS OF POWER STEERING AS I WAS TURNING IN MY DRIVEWAY. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER THE FOLLOWING WEEK AND I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS AND THE STAFF LOOKED AT ME AS IF I WERE ?CRAZY? TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT IT JUST HAPPENS UNEXPLAINABLE AND THEN WORKS FINE AGAIN. THE STAFF AT THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT LEAVE ME ASSURED THAT IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.   I CONTACTED A PRIVATE MECHANIC BY THE NAME OF LARRY REAVES, JR. WHO INSPECTED THE CAR ON JANUARY 12, 2008 AND AGAIN TOLD ME THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE POWER STEERING. AT THIS POINT, THE POWER STEERING HAS BEEN CHECKED BY BOTH GM CERTIFIED MECHANICS AND A PRIVATE MECHANIC AT COST TO ME. BOTH TIMES I WAS TOLD THAT THEY COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING WRONG THAT WOULD MAKE IT MALFUNCTION AS SUCH.   I HAVE NOW GROWN FEARFUL TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE, AS I HAD A MOMENTARY LOSS OF POWER STEERING AGAIN THIS PAST WEEKEND ON NOVEMBER 22, 2008 WHILE EXITING THE FREEWAY HEADING 75 NORTH IN ATLANTA.

IN DECEMBER I STOPPED FOR A RED LIGHT IN TRAFFIC AND SMELLED MELTING OR BURNING PLASTIC AND SECONDS LATER A SMALL CLOUD OF FOWL SCENTED SMOKE ENTERED THE CABIN OF THE VEHICLE. I SHUT THE VEHICLE OFF AND TRIED TO RESTART THE VEHICLE WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN AND THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT START. I CALLED FOR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND WAITED FOR THE TOW TRUCK . WHEN THE TOW TRUCK ARRIVED THE VEHICLE STARTED SMOKING FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND THEN CAUGHT FIRE. THE DAMAGE WAS NOT REPAIRABLE.    AT THE TIME I WAS CERTIFIED PONTIAC RETAIL PROFESSIONAL  AND AS OF NEW YEARS DAY HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN A RENTAL VEHICLE UNDER THE WARRANTY. THE MANUFACTURER HAS NOT BEEN THE LEAST BIT HELPFUL IN THE SITUATION AND AS A RESULT I HAVE SINCE LEFT MY JOB AS A GM SALES PROFESSIONAL. GM WILL NOT PROVIDE A RENTAL VEHICLE WHILE THEY DRAG THEIR FEET TO IDENTIFY THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. I HAVE WAITED UNTIL NEW YEARS DAY TO FILE THIS COMPLAINT TO GIVE GM AMPLE TIME TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE.  *NM",
