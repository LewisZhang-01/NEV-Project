WHAT HAS BEEN OF REAL CONCERN IS THAT THE WIRES GOING THROUGH THE TRAILER INTO THE SLIDE WAS INCORRECTLY INSTALLED AT THE FACTORY.  THE PLASTIC PROTECTIVE GROMMET BETWEEN THE WIRES GOING FROM THE TRAILER TO THE SLIDE WAS LEFT UNSECURED AND ALLOWED THE WIRES TO RUB INTO (AGAINST THE TRAILER FRAME)...UNTIL A SHORT OCCURRED.  THE REALLY BAD THING WAS THAT THE FUSE IN THE PANEL DID NOT BLOW DEPENDING ON THE POSITION OF THE SLIDE GOING IN AND OUT.  IT ALLOWED THE SPRING (HOLDING THE WIRES) UNDERNEATH THE BEDROOM SLIDE TO OVERHEAT TO THE POINT ONE COULDN'T TOUCH IT, AND YET DIDN'T BLOW THE FUSE SOMETIMES.  EXTREMELY DANGEROUS FIRE HAZARD IN MY OPINION. IT WAS FIXED, BUT I HAVE CONCERN THE REST OF THE ELECTRICAL ON THE TRAILER SHOULD BE CHECKED,  BUT HAVE YET TO RECEIVE A RESPONSE FROM KEYSTONE ABOUT THAT REQUEST. TRAILER WAS PARKED IN A RV PARK.",

THE FIFTH WHEEL CAME WITH THE WRONG SIZE WHEEL AND TIRE WITH THREE BEING LARGER TIRES ON 16' RIMS AND ONE BEING A SMALLER TIRE ON A 15' RIM. IT CAUSED THE UNIT WHICH IS A 40' LONG FIFTH WHEEL. A NEW UNIT FROM THE DEALER. WHEN WE REALIZED WHAT WAS GOING ON WE STOPPED AT THE NEAREST AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTER. KEYSTONE REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE ISSUE AT THE TIME LEAVING US IN ANOTHER STATE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO. OUR DEALER TOLD US THIS IS COMMON.",
