MAX LOAD OF THE TIRES IS 9880LBS, MY ACTUAL REAR AXLE WEIGHT 9270 (STATIC AND MOTORHOME EMPTY WITH NO WATER, FUEL TANK 1/3 FULL)  ACCORDING TO MICHELIN THAT IS ASKING FOR TIRE FAILURE ( HAD 2 ALREADY) BECAUSE THE DYNAMIC LOADS (GOING DOWN THE STREET, BUMPS - UPHILL - DOWNHILL- SIDELOADS) WILL BE OVER THE TIRE LIMIT. THAT'S THE REASON THE LAW REQUIRES PASS, CARS AND LIGHT TRUCKS TO HAVE A 16% RESERVE CAPACITY; MINE IS DOWN TO ABOUT 2%. WITH FULL FUEL AND WATER TANK, LITTLE BIT OF STAFF LOADED FOR VACATION OR PUTTING ANYTHING ON THE TRAILER HITCH (BOAT OR EVEN LOADED BIKE RACK) I AM OVERWEIGHT FOR THE EXISTING TIRES AND MAX REAR AXLE WEIGHT  I KNOW THAT IS NOT AN ISSUE FORD HAS TO DEAL BUT JAYCO.BUT I WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR EXPERTISE ABOUT WHAT TO DO (IS THAT MOTORHOME A RISK TO DRIVE , MAYBE UNSAFE?)   IS THERE ANY MEANS TO INCREASE THE MAX REAR AXLE WEIGHT ON THAT E450 CHASSIS?  ANY WAY I COULD PUT ON A DIFFERENT TIRE SIZE (ENOUGH ROOM ON THE RIM / WHEEL-WELL;THAT WOULD INCREASE THE MAX TIRE LOAD ABOUT 1000LBS - BUT IS THAT LEGAL AND DOABLE, ESPECIALLY. WITH THE DUAL TIRES.  I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR ANSWER  *LA",
