Mid-turn my power steering completely shut off and I almost got into an accident. Luckily there was a turn around right there I was able to veer to. Turning this vehicle without power steering is nearly impossible. I'm a strong guy and it was pretty tough for me. This issue happened completely out of the blue without any warning whatsoever. When it happened, the ESC light came on as well as saying something about power steering. I turned the car off and then back on and noticed that the ESC light and power steering message were now gone and the car drive as it should. But it decides to go out randomly at any given time while driving and that is a HUGE safety hazard for not only me but others on the road as well.  It has come to my attention after plenty of research that this seems to be massive issue among Chevrolet Malibu owners. The issue was recalled for different models/engines but not the 2.4 liter. At this point it's obvious that this is a vehicle wide issue and needs to be recalled for all models/engines.",

It should be noted that these reset themselves when car is turned off and then go back on unpredictably, once you start driving the car.  This mechanic then tried fixing the powerlocks, and stated that after replacing two of the powerlocks, he realized that they still did not work.  This mechanic contacted GM and was told that the issue with the powerlocks came from the the body control module, which aparently was causing the powerlocks to fail and was also the cause of the tire pressure sensors being on all the time, since the body control module controlled the powerlocks and the tire pressure sensors. He also stated that the Chevy dealer was the only ones who could change the body control module, since they were the only ones who reprogram the new module to the car. This mechanic also stated that all four tires pressure sensors were working.     I took the car to a Chevy dealer with same problem.  The dealer claimed that gasoline which contained a high level of ethanol was causing the ESC, traction control and limp mode problem.  They suggested for me to run the gas out and fill the car up three times with regular gasoline (87 octane) and that this would resolve this issue.  They claimed that the tire pressure sensors on two of the tire were not reading properly and needed to be replaced and that the power lock switch was the root of the powerlocks not working, since two of them (the ones that were not replaced by the first mechanic) were not working.

There is a video on youtube that covers replacing the torque tube sensor but what if that is not the cause? Yes, a GM tech 2 scan tool is required to set up the front end once the part has been replaced. Keep any bills you acquire during this job so that GM may reimburse you in the future should they decide to cover this repair. it also could be a module in the steering colum plus the turn signals do not shut off making it a hazard to drive while turn signals are still on!

The seat is available for inspection. I am an average sized adult in terms of weight (<200 lbs). Question: How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk?  Answer: The seat is no longer rigid and thus in the event of a crash I cannot believe the seat is safe. Question: Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center?  Answer: It is clear the seat failed - see the picture. Searching online I found many people with the same problem and the pictures online of the failure matched what happened with my seat. Question: Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others?  Answer: No, reading online people with the same problem were not happy with GM's lack of response so I did not bother to consult with GM on this broken seat. Question: Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear?  Answer: No. The failure occurred this year.

GM HAD A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE WITH MY EXACT MODEL BUT I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THEY WERE UNABLE TO HELP ME AND THAT MY CAR WASN'T ON THE RECALL BULLETIN YET MY CAR IS THE SAME MODEL AND YEAR THAT ON THE BULLETIN HAVING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. IT IS ALSO NOT ME, I SEE OTHERS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM AND THAT GM IS NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THIS DANGEROUS ISSUE. I JUST PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE AND IT HAS 160,000 MILES ON IT. THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE POWER STEERING IS ESSENTIAL TO DRIVER SAFETY. THIS HAPPENS ANYWHERE AT ANYTIME THE POWER STEERING DECIDES TO JUST SHUT ITSELF OFF.",

HE CALLED HURD CHEVY IN JOHNSON RI AND THEY TOLD HIM THERE WAS A RECALL. I THEN CALLED HURD AND THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS NO RECALL FOR MY VEHICLE AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. I THEN CALLED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT MY VEHICLE (DIAMOND CHEVY, AUBURN MA) AND SPOKE TO AN ADVISOR NAMED SEAN. HE TOLD ME THERE WAS A RECALL BUT THE SPECIAL EXTENDED WARRANTY EXPIRED 3/25/19 AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. I THEN CONTACTED GM ON THEIR WEBSITE AND EXPLAINED TO THEM THE SITUATION. THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS NO RECALL FOR MY VEHICLE AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. THE PROBLEM IS, I NEVER RECEIVED ANYTHING NOTIFYING ME OF THIS RECALL.

THAT FOLLOWING WEEK, (CARLESS) I WAS WAITING FOR THE TOW TO SHOW UP AND NO ONE CAME. I CALLED THE DEALSHIP AND SHE SAID THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED AND I HAD TO DRIVE MY VEHICLE IN, I EXPLAINED, AGAIN, THAT IT WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE.

I ALSO NOTICED THAT THERE'S A RECALL FOR THE 2012 MALIBU FOR SOMETHING SIMILAR TO WHAT MY PROBLEM IS, BUT NOT FOR THE 2009 MODEL. HOWEVER, WHEN LOOKING UP THE 2012 RECALL IT SAYS 2004-2012 MALIBU WERE UNDER RECALL, YET MY VIN FOR 2009 MALIBU SHOWS NO RECALLS. VERY ODD. IF NOT FIXED FOR FREE, I'LL BE LOOKING INTO CLASS ACTION.",

WHEN I ACCELERATED FROM A STOP AROUND THIRD GEAR THE VEHICLE'S RPMS SLAMMED UP TO AROUND 7K AND THEN AROUND FIFTH GEAR (I THINK AROUND 55 MPH) IT SLIPPED AGAIN, WHEN I WENT TO SLOW DOWN IT HUNG ON THE WAY DOWN. THEN, WHEN I PULLED INTO THE LEFT TURN LANE THE CAR WENT INTO \"LIMP\" MODE (THINK MICHIGAN UTURN). I THEN THOUGHT TO MYSELF, I SHOULD TRY SHUTTING IT OFF WHEN THE CARS IN FRONT OF ME STOPS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT MORE ISSUES WITH THE TRANSMISSION. SO, I DID AND THAT'S WHEN IT WOULDN'T SHIFT AGAIN INTO DRIVE NOR GO INTO REVERSE (WASN'T EXPECTING THAT). WHEN I WAS IN THE LEFT HAND TURN LANE IT CAUSED TRAFFIC TO BACKUP ONTO THE HIGHWAY (55MPH), NOT ONLY PUTTING MYSELF IN DANGER BUT EVERY PERSON BEHIND ME THAT ATTEMPTED TO PASS ME (I WAS ON MY WAY TO CHURCH'AND SO WERE 2,500 OTHER ATTENDEES).

CALLED GM AGAIN AND WADS TOLD TO TAKE IT BACK TO DEALERSHIP THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO AS FAR AS COST FOR FIXING IT WAS CONCERNED. MY CAR IS JUST SITTING IDLE BECAUSE I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE IT MORE THAN A FEW MILES-AFRAID IT WILL STALL OUT IN TRAFFIC. I HAVE LOOKED  THIS UP ON THE INTERNET HOPING TO GET SOME INFORMATION AS TO WHAT IS WRONG. THERE  ARE NUMEROUS PEOPLE WHO ARE HAVING THIS SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR MALIBUS.  NONE OF THE DEALERSHIPS SEEM TO KNOW WHAT IS WRONG AND OWNERS ARE STUCK WITH PAYING TO HAVE NUMEROUS THINGS REPLACED THAT DO NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.

I DO HAVE A RECALL THAT I HAVE NOT HAD FIXED YET FOR THE BRAKE LAMP MALFUNCTION 13036 WHICH DEALER STATED IS UNRELATED ISSUE.  I SEE SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE ONLINE ARE REPORTING THIS SAME ISSUE FOR THE 2009 4 CYLINDER CHEVY MALIBU'S.  I WOULD HOPE GM WILL RECALL THIS AND TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM.",

HOWEVER, I WENT TO THE CHEVROLET FORUMS ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND HUNDREDS OF IDENTICAL PROBLEMS REPORTED TO GM BY USERS, BUT GM HAS TAKEN NO ACTION TO CORRECT THIS DANGEROUS FIRE HAZARD. THE COMPLAINTS BEGIN IN 2012 WHEN THE CARS WERE ONLY 3 YEARS OLD AND CONTINUE TO BE FILED.   I CONTACTED GM AND WAS SIMPLY TOLD \"THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY\". THERE HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED RECALLS FOR OTHER GM VEHICLES WITH THE SAME FUEL PUMP AND PROBLEM AND THIS VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED. PLEASE HAVE THESE VEHICLES RECALLED BEFORE A FAMILY DEPARTS TIS EARTH IN A BALL OF FLAMES BECAUSE OF THE UNCARING ATTITUDE OF GM.  FOLSOM CHEVROLET, 916-985-5600, HAS DIAGNOSED MY MY VEHICLE AND CAN PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION AND DETAILS.

UNDER RECALL OR NOT, UNDER WARRANTY OR NOT I THINK A RESPONSIBLE COMPANY SHOULD AT LEASE INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF GAS LEAK IN CAR TO FIND OUT THE PROBLEM AND CORRECTED IT, IMPROVED THE MATERIALS OR DESIGN IN THEIR FUTURE CARS.THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TO FIND OUT  THAT LIVES WERE LOST DUE TO GAS LEAK DEFECT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CORRECTED SOONER. IF THEY WANT ME TO BRING THE FUEL ASSEMBLY PARTS TO DEALERSHIP (WHICH I SUGGESTED TO [XXX]) FOR INVESTIGATION OF POSSIBLE MATERIAL OR DESIGN FLAW, JUST LET ME KNOW.    THANK YOU.

I THINK THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL, SIMPLY BECAUSE I'VE HAD TO HAVE PEOPLE CRAWL OVER SEATS JUST TO GET OUT BECAUSE THE DOORS WOULDN'T UNLOCK. IF IT SITS OUT IN THE SUN, THEY WILL EITHER LOCK AND WONT UNLOCK, OR THEY WONT LOCK AT ALL. IS THIS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE? SOMEONE BEING LOCKED IN THEIR CAR????",

I LOOKED UP AND FOUND THERE IS A RECALL ON CERTAIN 2009 MALIBU YOUR CAMPAIGN NUMBER 14V153000 AND MY CAR IS DOING EXACTLY WHAT THAT RECALL DESCRIBES BUT LOCAL CHEVY DEALER SAID THEY COULDN'T REPAIR UNDER THAT CAMPAIGN BECAUSE MY VIN NUMBER ([XXX] DOESN'T SHOW UP WITH A RECALL FOR POWER STEERING. DRIVING DOWN THE INTERSTATE AT 70 MPH AND HAVING YOU POWER STEERING GO OUT IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN AND LIKE I SAID ITS EXACTLY WHAT YOUR CAMPAIGN DESCRIBES.  PLEASE HELP    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",

I FELT TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF, AND NO ONE EXPLAINED TO ME AS TO WHY THIS TOOK PLACE. I AM THINKING IT MUST BE APART OF THE RECALL. SO I SENT A LETTER TO CORPORATE ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE.

I INFLATED IT, THEN DROVE HOME. THE NEXT MORNING (12-20) THE TIRE WAS VERY LOW AGAIN SO WE INFLATED IT AND TOOK THE CAR TO AMERICAN TIRE IN OCEANSIDE. MY HUSBAND AND I DECIDED THAT SINCE THE TREAD WAS GETTING LOW WE WOULD GET A SET OF NEW TIRES. THE NEXT  MORNING ONE TIRE WAS VERY LOW AGAIN. WE WENT BACK TO AMERICAN TIRE. THEY FOUND THAT THE LEAK WAS FROM A CRACK IN THE WHEEL. SINCE THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME THIS HAPPENED WE DECIDED TO CONTACT CHEVROLET BECAUSE WE FELT IT WAS A DEFECT IN MANUFACTURING.

AFTER 30 MINUTES OR SO IT WILL THEN LOCK THE DOORS. THE LATEST ISSUE STARTED ON THE 19TH OF NOVEMBER 2014 WITH THE DRIVER SIDE LOWBEAM NOT WORKING AS LIKE IT'S BLOWN. THE CAR HAS BEEN SITTING FOR TWO DAYS SINCE AND NOW THE LOWBEAM IS WORKING BUT, IT'S DIM COMPARED TO THE PASSENGER LOWBEAM. I BELIEVE THERE'S A SHORT IN THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM FROM MANUFACTURER. THERE ARE MANY FORUMS ONLINE ABOUT THESE ISSUES ONLINE FROM OTHER OWNERS. THIS CAR HAS NOT HAD ANY AFTERMARKET INSTALLATIONS OF ITS ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS AND THE BATTERY IS NEW. CHEVROLET NEEDS TO TAKE THE TIME WHEN MANUFACTURING THEIR VEHICLES INSTEAD OF CUTTING CORNERS. THEIR CUSTOMERS SAFETY SHOULD BE VALUED BETTER THAN WORRYING ABOUT SALES. YOU WOULD THINK AFTER GOING UNDER THEY WOULD TAKE THE TIME TO DO THINGS RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. I HIGHLY DOUBT I WILL EVER PURCHASE A VEHICLE MANUFACTURED AFTER 2002 FROM CHEVROLET DUE TO ALL OF THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS THAT FAIL OR CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.

WHEN  I STOPPED AND PARKED THE CAR AND TURNED THE CAR OFF, ALL THE DOORS AUTOMATICALLY UNLOCKED NORMALLY EXCEPT THE ONE IN THE BACK WHERE MY GRANDSON WAS SITTING.  HE TRIED OPENING THE DOOR FROM THE INSIDE AND IT WOULD NOT OPEN.  I TRIED OPENING IT FROM THE OUTSIDE, AND IT WOULD NOT OPEN.  I TRIED THE BUTTON ON THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR, AND THE DOOR STILL WOULD NOT OPEN.  I TRIED USING THE REMOTE CONTROL, AND IT STILL WOULD NOT OPEN.  THE ONLY WAY I COULD GET THE DOOR OPEN WAS BY CRAWLING ACROSS THE BACK SEAT AND OPENING THE LOCK BY HAND BY PULLING UP ON THE MANUAL DOOR LOCK.  THERE IS A CHILD SAFETY LOCK ON THE DOOR PANEL BUT IT WAS IN THE OFF POSITION.     THIS VEHICLE HAS A DIGITAL READ OUT ON THE DASHBOARD TELLING YOU THE TIRE PRESSURE, AMOUNT OF MILEAGE LEFT ON THE OIL CHANGE, MILES PER GALLON, AND VARIOUS OTHER INFORMATION, BUT NOTHING INDICATING THAT ONE OF THE DOORS WILL NOT OPEN.  IT IS MY OPINION THAT THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SAFETY ISSUE IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT OR FIRE.  IN A SERIOUS SITUATION OF LIFE OR DEATH, IT MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE BACK DOOR OPEN IF THE DOOR WILL NOT OPEN AUTOMATICALLY, USING THE BUTTON ON THE DRIVERS DOOR, OR WITH THE REMOTE CONTROL.  THERE IS NO WAY TO KNOW THE DOOR WILL NOT OPEN SINCE THERE IS NO WARNING ON THE DIGITAL PANEL.  I HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG THE LOCK HAD NOT BEEN OPERATING PROPERLY SINCE THERE IS SELDOM ANYONE IN THE BACK SEAT NEEDING TO EXIT VIA THAT DOOR.  I FEEL THIS IS A SERIOUS DEFECT IN THIS AUTOMOBILE AND THE NTSB NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE AUTOMATIC DOOR LOCKS ON THIS CAR ARE UNSAFE AND UNABLE TO OPEN, EXCEPT MANUALLY, IN AN EMERGENCY, AND REQUIRE SOME SORT OF WARNING WHEN THE AUTOMATIC DOOR LOCKS ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY.     *TR",

THE PROBLEM CONTAINED HERE IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC CONDITION WAITING TO HAPPEN. WE (OWNERS OF CHEVY MALIBUS OF YEARS 2008-09, AND 10') NEED AN INVESTIGATION TO BE INITIATED.     SUMMARY OF PROBLEM: THE CHEVROLET MALIBU 2008,2009, AND 2010 HAS A MANUFACTURING PROBLEM WITH THE DOOR LOCK ACTUATORS (WHICH OPEN AND CLOSE THE LOCKS ON THE DOORS). FOR THE MALIBU YEAR 2009, AT APPROXIMATELY 35K MILE MARK ALL POWER LOCKS OF ALL FOUR DOORS RANDOMLY OPEN AND LOCK AT ANY VEHICLE FORWARD SPEED AT RANDOM TIMES. AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF LACK OF SAFETY CONCERNS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP FROM COUNTLESS CUSTOMERS THROUGH DIFFERENT WEBSITES AND ARE BEGINNING TO COME IN A MORE FORMAL MANNER SUCH AS THIS PUBLIC TOOL.     SAFETY FLAW:   SINCE THE OPENING AN CLOSING OF THE LOCKS ON DOORS IS OF RANDOM MANNER AND OF RAPID FREQUENCY (OPENS AND CLOSES VERY FAST) IT POSES ALL OCCUPANTS TO REMAIN INSIDE THE VEHICLE UNABLE TO ESCAPE IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE, VEHICLE CRASH, OR ANY OTHER EMERGENCY. LIKEWISE, WHEN THE INTENT IS TO HAVE THE DOORS LOCKED IT POSES THE ISSUE THAT THE DOOR LOCKS WILL BECOME OPEN AT UNEXPECTED TIMES.    SOLUTION:  AVOID CASUALTIES, INCIDENTS, AND KEEP THE SAFETY OF OUR LOVED ONES IN MIND. WE NEED THE NHTSA TO LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION ON THIS ISSUE.  *TR",

ON JULY 29, 2013 I PULLED INTO A SERVICE STATION FOR GAS IN NORTH CAROLINA.  ALL PUMPS WERE TAKEN. I WAITED. A CAR PULLED OUT SO I PUT MY CAR IN REVERSE TO BACK UP IN ORDER TO GET TO THE PUMP.  WHEN I TRIED TO PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE, THE GEAR SHIFT WOULD MOVE, HOWEVER, THE CAR REMAINED STUCK IN REVERSE.  I HAD TO BACK UP TO THE SIDE OF THE GAS STATION TO MOVE OUT OF THE WAY.  I PUT THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ON BECAUSE THE CAR WOULD NOT GO INTO PARK. I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION, THEN TRIED TO RESTART IT.  THE CAR WOULD NOT START BECAUSE IS WAS NOT IN PARK. I CALLED MY BROTHER FOR HELP. HE NOTICED THE SHIFT CABLE HAD COME APART.  HE USED A TWIST TIE, A WASHER, AND A RUBBER CAP THAT HE FOUND IN HIS VEHICLE TO REPAIR THE SHIFT CABLE SO THAT I COULD HOPEFULLY MAKE IT BACK HOME.  IT WORKED.THE NEXT DAY I  MADE AN APPOINTMENT (07/31/13) TO TAKE THE CAR BACK TO OURISMAN TO FIX THE CABLE.  THAT INVOICE STATES THAT I NEED A SHIFTER CABLE.  ACCORDING TO OURISMAN, THIS PART IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE INITIAL RECALL.  THE SHIFT CABLE ADJUSTMENT CLIP BROKE OFF SOMEHOW. THE CABLE IS STILL INTACT. THAT'S WHY MY BROTHER WAS ABLE TO FIX IT ENOUGH TO GET ME BACK HOME. I WAS TOLD BY THE CUSTOMER SERVICE TECHNICIAN THAT THE PART BROKE DUE TO NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR. IN THE PAST, I'VE OWNED A CHEVROLET CAVALIER FOR 12 YEARS, AND A CHEVROLET BERETTA FOR 8 YEARS. NEITHER CAR HAD THIS PROBLEM OF \"NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR\". IT'S A DEFECT.  THE 2/21/13 INVOICE SAYS REPLACED CABLE KIT.  THE  7/31/13 INVOICE SAYS \"NEEDS SHIFTER CABLE\". THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE SHIFT CABLE ADJUSTMENT CLIP BROKE OFF THE SHIFTER CABLE.

ON REPLACEMENT PARTS HAS EXPIRED. IF GM KNOWS THERE IS A CONTINUOUS PROBLEM WITH THIS MAKE/MODEL AND THIS COMPONENT THEN IT SHOULD BE COVERED REGARDLESS. HOW MANY TIMES SHOULD YOU HAVE TO TAKE VEHICLE IN FOR SAME SET OF ISSUES. IF GM DOES NOT OWN THIS PROBLEM I WILL NEVER BUY A GM VEHICLE AGAIN!  *TR",

I'M THINKING THEY WOULD HAVE IF THEY COULD CHARGE ME TO FIX SOMETHING ADDITIONAL ON THE CAR.    I JUST PAID $250 TO REPLACE WHAT I WAS TOLD WAS A BURNED OUT BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH ON MARCH 9TH, (PALMEN MOTORS, KENOSHA, WI), AND ITS ALREADY RECURRING.  I HEARD PART OF POSSIBLE RECALL ON WNN ABC NEWS AND STARTED RESEARCHING AND ENDED UP AT YOUR SITE THIS MORNING.  I WANT TO REPORT THIS.

IF YOU ARE SITTING STILL WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING AND YOU TURN THE STEERING WHEEL VERY SLIGHTLY LEFT OR RIGHT, IT FEELS STIFF AT FIRST, FOLLOWED BY A SUDDEN BURST OF ASSIST, WHICH CAUSES YOU TO CONTINUALLY FIGHT THE CAR TO GO IN A STRAIGHT LINE.  THIS IS A POTENTIAL DESIGN FLAW.  THE V6 MALIBU THAT I DROVE WITH HYDRAULIC POWER STEERING IS NOT A PROBLEM, ONLY THE 4 CYLINDER.      I HAVE COMPLAINED TO THE DEALERSHIP AS I ONLY RECENTLY PURCHASED THE CAR ON JULY 24, 2009.  THEY CONTACTED TECHNICAL SUPPORT AT CHEVROLET.  THEY HAVE HAD OTHER COMPLAINTS, BUT THERE IS NO FIX YET.  THEY SAY IN THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING, A TORQUE SENSOR IS ACTIVATED WHEN YOU MOVE THE STEERING WHEEL, SO IT MUST BE MOVED WITHOUT ASSIST FOR A SPLIT SECOND UNTIL IT RECOGNIZES THAT YOU WANT TO TURN AND APPLIES POWER ASSIST.  IT CANNOT BE ADJUSTED.  THIS IS THE CAUSE OF THE CONTINUOUS OVER CORRECTION ISSUE.  HOW CAN THIS BE SAFE?    THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE THAT CHEVROLET SAYS IS \"NORMAL OPERATION\" AT THIS TIME. *TR",

FOR EXAMPLE, IF A DRIVER IS SITTING AT A 4 WAY STOP, OR LIKEWISE, BECAUSE THE TURN SIGNAL DOES NOT WRAP AROUND THE FRONT OR BACK OF THE CAR, DRIVERS TO THE LEFT, AND RIGHT OF THE CAR, CANNOT SEE THE TURN SIGNAL, WHICH POSES A SAFETY HAZARD.  ON THE 2008 MALIBU, THERE WAS A SIDE MARKER REPEATER LAMP ON THE FRONT QUARTER PANEL, AND IT WAS REMOVED FROM THE 2009 MY.
