I TURNED EVERYTHING OFF THAT I COULD, HOWEVER THE NEXT MORNING WHEN I WAS READY FOR WORK, MY BATTERY WAS DEAD. I WENT TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP TO REPLACE A RELAY AND THE SERVICE MANAGER ASKED ME WHAT PROBLEMS WAS I HAVING. HE SAID THAT THE PROBLEM WAS LINKED TO A LEAKING WINDSHIELD THAT WAS IN THE FORD EXPEDITIONS, PICKUPS AND THE LINCOLN NAVIGATORS. WHEN WATER LEAKED IT, IT WOULD RUN INTO THE CONTROL MODULES AND CAUSE PROBLEMS, INCLUDING FIRE.  HE RECOMMENDED THAT I FILE AN INSURANCE CLAIM TO HAVE MY WINDSHIELD REPAIRED FIRST, THEN BRING MY CAR TO HIM AND HE COULD FIX IT FOR A NOMINAL FEE.  FOR A SECOND OPINION, I TO MY VEHICLE TO THE LINCOLN/MERCURY DEALER AND TOLD THE SERVICE MANAGER THE STORY THAT I RECEIVED FROM FORD AND HE SAID THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE AND ASKED ME TO LEAVE MY VEHICLE WITH THEM SO THEY COULD FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.  HE CALLED THE NEXT DAY AND SAID THAT HE THINK THAT I HAD A BAD COMPRESSOR AND COMPRESSOR RELAY THAT HE COULD CHANGE FOR ABOUT $800 BUT SAID THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHY I STILL HAD POWER TO EVERYTHING EVEN AFTER I TURNED THE SWITCH OFF.  HE ALSO SAID THAT HE HAD RAN WATER ON MY VEHICLE AND COULD FIND NO LEAK IN THE WINDSHIELD.  WHEN I GOT IN MY VEHICLE, THE BATTERY WAS DOWN AS ALWAYS SO I ASKED THE SERVICE MANAGER FOR A JUMP START.
