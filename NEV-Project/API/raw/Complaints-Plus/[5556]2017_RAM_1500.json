        "summary": "On Sunday March 27, 2022 my daughter and I were in my 2017 Ram 1500 Bighorn 5.7 liter Hemi, driving east bound on a major road leading from my neighborhood. We were going about 50 mph when the entire dash board lit up like a Christmas tree, windshield wipers, radio volume going up and down, all sensors going off, and the entire speedometer went black, all of this happened going full speed, oh, and the gear shift knob turned off!!!! I couldn\u2019t control my vehicle at all. All of this happened and then it just went black, no speedometer, no gear shifter, and no steering control!! I want to remind you that I was driving with my child in the truck!! It is now at my local mechanic with the truck completely bricked. No power whatsoever, gear is stuck, and the key fob is stuck in ACC and they cannot get it out. This needs to be investigated asap. If I was in the highway we would have killed ourselves and possibly someone else. I lost all control over my vehicle due to some freak electrical issue Chrysler refuses to fix. Maybe a fat lawsuit will help. If you research the complaints on this vehicle, you will see this is not the first time this has happened. Does someone, or a family, have to die first before you will respond?!! This is on you Chrysler to do the right thing. Recall these trucks ASAP. I swear to you someone is going to die if you do not act now!! I\u2019m a combat veteran who has been in actual combat, and this was one of the most terrifying incidents of my life, mainly because my babygirl was in there with me. For the price I paid for this truck, it should be darn near bulletproof. Sad day when American manufacturers put profit over people.",

I understand there are some issues with the EPS system on several of the Ram 1500 Model years, and there has even been a recall on some models.  I feel it necessary to report this incident as I am afraid to drive the vehicle, which makes this purchase useless, even after researching this vehicles history before buying, I had no way of knowing of the current EPS problems as there are no current recalls for my particular truck.  If there is a problem with the EPS system, at the time of manufacturing, then why haven't the 2017 models been recalled as well.  Also my local dealer cannot effectively make any repairs unless he has a code or the power steering is not available at the time he inspects it, and ironically  it works fine intermittently.",

        "summary": "While traveling on a paved state maintained  road at approximately 45-50 miles per hour, the driver side front tire on my 2017 RAM 1500 exploded.  The condition of the road at the time was clear and there were no foreign objects laying in the lane of travel. Upon the tire exploding, I was immediately pulled left into the opposing lane of traffic. No injuries or crash were reported during this incident, however had my rate of speed been higher, lack of driving skills, or oncoming traffic, the results could have proved to be fatal. After finding a safe location off of the travelled roadway, I replaced the faulty tire with a spare. I observed damage to my inner fender liner as a result of the explosion. The tire has not been inspected by the police, insurance company, or the manufacturer.  No warning lamps or other indicators provided notification of any problems prior to the incident. The faulty tire in question is Identified as a Goodyear Wrangler SR-A, P275/60R20. This tire is an original installation from the vehicle manufacturer and has been in service for 20,300 miles. This particular tire blew out in a straight line fashion across the tread section of the tire from sidewall to the opposite sidewall.   This is the first time that I have ever reported a safety matter, however due to the unique circumstances of the failure of this tire, I feel that this matter should be investigated and this tire removed from service. I have conducted internet searches and found other consumers have experienced the exact same tire failure scenario. I will be replacing all four Gooodyear tires on my RAM truck tomorrow with a completely different manufacturer. The tire can be retained for inspection if necessary, although it will be disposed of if no such request is received.",

I've never been in an accident. I've never used the truck to tow anything. I don't drive off-road. I DO perform regular maintenance before the recommended time/mileage. I use quality products (oils, filters, brakes, etc.).   No 5 year old vehicle should have a failed suspension from regular commuter/family driving.   The suspension has been finicky for over two years mainly occurs in the colder months. My friend owns the same model truck (can provide VIN if needed) and his truck's suspension failed after year one. Luckily, it was still under warranty but took multiple trips to the dealership and much hassle to fully repair/replace his truck's suspension.   Prior to my truck's suspension completely failing rendering it not drivable, there were many times I was driving on the highway alone and sometimes with my family when the truck would drop lower than entry mode with no warning - a huge safety risk to passengers and cars around me. The truck would be moving at highway speeds with essentially no suspension causing it to bounce and wobble within the lane and over the line. My children are now afraid to drive in the truck.   Please hold Ram-Dodge-Chrysler accountable. Please make them do what is right. Please issue a recall for the air suspension. They should fix the air suspension supplying a lifetime warranty OR replace the air suspension with a tradition suspension that won't fail in cold weather. Ram owners have paid a premium for this vehicle. Please fix this safety issue.  (I have included two pictures of my truck at the Dodge Service Center. Not surprisingly, it is parked next to another Ram Rebel with the same suspension issue. Notice the fenders almost touching the wheels particularly in the back. Also on the truck next to mine, notice the tilt to the right and the sinking in the back.)",

The 1st time it happened, I was driving with my wife and handicapped 33 year old son in the vehicle, and had made a left hand turn on to a fairly busy street near my home. In the midst of my turn, the \"Service Power Steering\" warning message came on the instrument cluster AND at that point the power steering locked up and basically I had to drive without it! It is extremely dangerous trying to maneuver, but I was able to make WIDE turns and get a few blocks to my home. When arriving home, I immediately called the dealer we bought the truck from and arranged for it to be towed and serviced. I had gone outside to start the truck several times to see if the warning and steering had rectified itself. By the time the tow truck driver arrived (2 hours later) he had me start the truck and it was completely fine! Within the next few days I began to notice an icon on the instrument cluster every time I started the truck of a red steering wheel with an exclamation mark. Even though the truck was driving fine at that point I decided to call the dealer and bring it in for service. They had it for several days and no \"code\" could be retrieved and it did not happen while they drove it. Fast forward a month or so(9-5-2021), and I was parked in a friends driveway. When I started the truck it happened again. Knowing I had a ways to travel, I started to turn the engine on and off several times. It went away and was fine and has been once again ever since, but the steering wheel icon upon starting the engine is still there. This defect is very concerning to me because of having to transport a handicapped adult! It is terribly dangerous because of the electronic steering going out. It is very, very hard to maneuver my truck.",

This has been an ongoing issue with the HEMI engine in RAM trucks as evidenced by multiple NHTSA complaints spanning over a decade. Ram has yet to correct the issue and continues to produce vehicles with the same problem. Mechanics talk about it being common, many forums are filled with complaints and websites are dedicated to the issue. My particular truck was inspected by the dealership and I was told it was \"a common occurrence with those engines\". I'm fine with having to pay the $500 repair bill to correct it, but I feel it should be a recall due to the commonality of the problem and the possibility of a driver or passenger being exposed to exhaust gasses not being properly routed to the rear of the truck. Why are they allowed to keep rolling a known problem off of the assembly line? Maybe this explains headaches after a long drive.",

I had to call for a tow truck to pull me out of the drive thru I was stuck at and my truck is currently at my mechanics shop. I was fortunate that this incident took place while moving at a slow speed while in a drive thru at a restaurant.  If this had taken place while driving on the freeway or in traffic, I believe I would most likely be dead right now, this was a total shutdown of my truck with absolutely no warning. I called the dealer to advise of the incident and ask if there were any known issues and they were quick to say that only 2018 dodge ram 1500 trucks had this issue and it had to be my battery. Both Triple AAA tow truck driver and mechanic shop that currently has my truck have confirmed that the battery is working perfectly and has no issues. I purchased my truck Oct of 2017 and I am worried that I might have a faulty computer system. Can someone please investigate this incident, I had my 15 yr old son in the truck with me and as I mentioned before if this had happened on the freeway at 75 mph and it completely shut down this same way, we most likely would have been in a major accident and injured and possibly killed. My mechanic spent the entire day trying to find the problem with the truck but is not able to obtain any error codes from the computer. It seems impossible that my truck can completely shut down with no warning, fail to start, fail to be able to remove the key fob from the ignition and yet there is no error showing in the system.",

ON IMPACT, MY DRIVER'S SEAT BROKE CAUSING ME TO LAY FLAT, RIPPING MY GRIP OFF THE STEERING WHEEL  AND THEN GOING INTO ON COMING TRAFFIC WHICH CAUSED ME TO HEAD ON COLLIDE WITH A CHEV. AVALANCHE TOTALING ALL THREE VEHICLES. I INJURED MY NECK, LOWER AND MIDDLE BACK. ALSO, BRUISED MY SHOULDER, RIBS AND UPPER ARM. I HAVE TWO CONCERNS. I BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE BETTER TESTING OF REAR-END COLLISIONS. I BELIEVE IF MY SEAT WOULD NOT HAVE BROKE, I WOULD HAVE STAYED IN CONTROL OF MY VEHICLE POSSIBLY PREVENTING MY TRUCK GOING INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC. ALSO, MY BACK AND NECK WOULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED AS MUCH WHIPPING MOTION CAUSING MY INJURIES. MY SECOND CONCERN IS THE AIRBAGS NOT DEPLOYING IN THE HEAD ON COLLISION. THE AVALANCHE'S AIRBAGS DEPLOYED BUT MINE DID NOT. I WROTE CHRYSLER AN EMAIL REPORTING THE INCIDENT AND MY CONCERNS. THEY APPOINTED BOSCH EAA TO INVESTIGATE IT THE INCIDENT AND INSPECT MY TOTALED TRUCK AND REVIEW THE DATA FROM MY VEHICLE'S COMPUTER. BOSCH HAS TOLD ME THEY SENT THE INVESTIGATION REPORT TO CHRYSLER TO REVIEW AND THEY WILL RESPOND TO ME WITHIN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS.

LIFTED UP AND IT RELEASED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE AND AGAIN VEHICLE STARTED BACKING UP INTO THE WATER.  I HAD TO IMMEDIATELY JUMP IN THE TRUCK AND HIT THE BRAKES JUST IN TIME AS IT HIT THE WATER.  I HAVE REVIEWED THIS ISSUE AND IT APPEARS TO BE FOCUSED ON 2013 - 2016 MODEL YEARS.  HOWEVER, THIS IS A BRAND NEW 2017.
