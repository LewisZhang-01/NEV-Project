When I got back in cranked the engine I started pulling forward, I did not have any power steering at all. I first thought the steering wheel had locked but I really had to power down on the steering to get it to turn. No noise, no indication, no problems of any kind with the steering or anything wrong while driving just a few minutes before. The power steering just stopped working period.  I told my daughter we were lucky this hadn't happened on the road while pulling the loaded trailer. This could have been very dangerous or deadly if it had gone out while we were pulling the loaded trailer while on the road.  If we had been going around a curve or making a turn and it had happened like it did in the yard while parked with NO indication of a problem it would have been very, very bad especially again with NO indications of a problem with the steering and pulling a trailer loaded with hay. I shudder to think what could have happened if we had been going around a curve at 55mph on the highway and this had happened. Power steering fluid pump up to the full line on the check stick when I pulled it out of the power steering pump. I have had the Avalanche for 3 years and have never had to add fluid nor does it have leak anywhere. Again, NO steering problems whatsoever before this.",

The truck has a p0265 code which is a fault in the ECBM do to the solder joint on the relay in the board.

I HAVE HAD CONTINUED AND CONSISTENT UNWANTED ANTI-LOCK BRAKE (ABS) ACTIVATION WHEN TRAVELING AT LOW SPEEDS AND APPROACHING STOP SIGNS, STOP LIGHTS, AND YIELD SIGNS AT OR NEAR INTERSECTIONS. THE UNWANTED ABS ACTIVATION HAS NEARLY CAUSED SEVERAL ACCIDENTS. THE UNWANTED ABS ACTIVATION APPEARS IDENTICAL AND CONSISTENT WITH GM PRODUCT RECALL 05068 AND NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER 05V-379 IN WHICH 804,000 GMC AND CHEVROLET VEHICLES WERE RECALLED FOR UNWANTED ABS ACTIVATION. THE PRIMARY GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AFFECTED APPEARS TO BE THE SALT BELT STATES. THE PROBLEM APPEARED TO BE ABS WHEEL SENSORS NOT PROPERLY PREPARED PRIOR TO INSTALLATION CAUSING RUST AND/OR CORROSION TO AFFECT THE WHEEL SENSORS. ALTHOUGH A CHECK OF MY VIN DOES NOT YIELD ANY SAFETY RECALLS ON MY SPECIFIC VEHICLE, I BELIEVE MY VEHICLE IS AFFECTED BY THE SAME FRONT WHEEL SENSOR CORROSION ISSUE AS THOSE VEHICLES LISTED IN THE RECALL. MY VEHICLE IS A 2002 AVALANCHE WHICH IS ONE OF THE VEHICLES AFFECTED. I ALSO RESIDE IN MINNESOTA WHICH IS ONE OF THE STATES AFFECTED. I AM CONCERNED THIS MAY CAUSE AND ACCIDENT. I ALSO BELIEVE THIS IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT AND THEREFOR THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY DEFECT THAT MAY JEOPARDIZE CONSUMER SAFETY. I WOULD LIKE MY WHEEL SENSORS CLEANED AND/OR REPLACED PER GM RECALL AND AT NO COST TO ME.",

I IMMEDIATELY ENTERED THE TRUCK AND TRIED TO PRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL AND IT HIT THE FLOOR, WHICH MEANT I HAD NO BRAKES TO DRIVE MY VEHICLE. IT WAS A SCARY TO THINK I COULD HAVE BEEN DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY WITH MY WIFE AND KIDS IN THE TRUCK.  I LIFTED MY TRUCK ON THE REAR AND PERFORM AN INSPECTION. I NOTICED THE BLACK RUBBER HOSE HAD A SPLIT IN IT AND THE OTHER BRAKE LINES WERE SEVERELY CORRODED.  I BOUGHT A NEW RUBBER AND INSTALLED IT (BANJO UNION-IN THE CENTER  REAR) AND THEN BEGAN TO TRY PRESSING THE BRAKES AGAIN TO SEE IF THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVE.  NEXT, I SAW MORE FLUID DRIPPING OUT OF DRIVER SIDE METAL BRAKE LINE.   I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!!  I STILL COULD NOT DRIVE MY TRUCK BECAUSE THE RUSTED DRIVER SIDE BRAKE LINE HAD A HOLE.  I WISH THE DEALERSHIP TECH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT THIS TO MY ATTENTION WHEN I HAD MY BRAKES AND ROTORS INSTALLED.   VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION!!  AFTER READING MULTIPLE POST ON VARIOUS WEBSITES ABOUT GM POSITION REGARDING THE RUSTED LINES, I AM NOT GOING TO BUY ANOTHER GM VEHICLE IF I DECIDE TO TRADE THIS ONE.  *TR",

I'M THINKING THE DEFECTIVE PART THAT SHOULD BE ISSUED A RECALL FOR IS GOING UN-NOTICED BY THE NHTSA BECAUSE THE PERSON MAKING THE COMPLAINT DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO RESOLVE AND CORRECTLY DESCRIBE IT. BECAUSE OF THIS THE NHTSA MAY OVERLOOK THAT THIS IS THE SAME ISSUE. THE FOLLOWING LINK WILL TAKE YOU TO THE CHEVY AVALANCHE FAN CLUB FORUM WHERE THE ISSUE IS DESCRIBED AND DISCUSSED.   HTTP://WWW.CHEVYAVALANCHEFANCLUB.COM/CAFCNA/INDEX.PHP/TOPIC,39437.0.HTML  MANY OF THE FORUM MEMBERS ARE BEING TOLD BY CHEVY DEALERS THAT THE ISSUE IS WITH THE FUEL PUMP, WHICH IS IN MOST CASES INCORRECT. THIS IS CAUSING THE CONSUMER TO PAY TO $1000.00 FOR PARTS AND REPAIRS THAT ARE NOT NEEDED. THE COST FOR REPAIR OF THE CRANK SHAFT POSITION SENSOR IS $110.00 FOR PARTS AND $170.00 FOR LABOR, AND THIS RESOLVES THE PROBLEM. PLEASE HAVE THE INVESTIGATOR TAKE A LOOK AT THE WEBSITE GIVEN ABOVE FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ISSUE. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A DEFECTIVE PART THAT IF UNDER THE RIGHT CONDITIONS CAN CAUSE A MAJOR ACCIDENT AND POSSIBLE LOSS OF LIFE. WITH TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER ON A 6,600LBS TRUCK I FOUND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN AND VERY DIFFICULT TO STOP. CHEVY HAS ALSO RE-DESIGNED THE PART PROVING EVIDENCE THAT THE ORIGINAL DESIGN WAS/IS DEFECTIVE. I SEE THIS AS A MORE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS ISSUE THAN THE TAIL GATE STRAP RECALL AND AT LEAST AS EQUAL OR HIGHER OF AN ISSUE AS THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKE DEFECT WHICH THE NHTSA HAS ISSUED RECALLS FOR. *JB",

MY WIFE WAS DRIVING TO WORK AND NEEDED TO ACCELERATE TO MERGE ONTO THE FREEWAY AND INSTANTLY THE TRANSMISSION BEGAN TO WHINE AND STOPPED OPERATING WHICH PLACED HER INTO THE PATH OF A LARGE TRUCK BEARING DOWN ON HER RATHER QUICKLY. THANKFULLY SHE WAS ABLE TO GLIDE OUT OF THE PATH OF THE TRUCK TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. WE HAD THE TAHOE TOWED BACK TO OUR DEALERSHIP AND WE DETERMINED THAT THE TRANSMISSION \"SUN SHELL\" HAD FAILED AND WOULD BE REPLACED. OUR DEALER ASSURED US THAT THIS WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM, BECAUSE THE NEW PARTS WERE DESIGNED TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE. OUR DEALER FURTHER STATED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN REPAIRING A LARGE NUMBER OF VEHICLES WITH THESE FAILURES.   OUR TAHOE WENT OFF OF IT'S NEW CAR WARRANTY ON MILEAGE NOT NUMBER OF MONTHS SOMETIME IN APRIL OF 2005 (36 MONTHS WOULD HAVE ENDED THIS AUGUST).

THEY TOLD ME AND SHOWED ME THE \"EXCESSIVE RUST\" ON THE ROTORS.  THE VEHICLE IS ONLY 3 YRS OLD AND ONLY HAD 35,000 MILES ON IT.  I WAS UPSET THAT THEY GOT TO THAT POINT AND NOW IT WAS GOING TO COST ME $1000 TO REPLACE THEM.  ALL MY SERVICE WAS PERFORMED AT THIS DEALER.

I DID NOT ALLOW THEM TO DO THE JOB AND HAD IT PERFORMED AT ANOTHER SERVICE CENTER.   THIS AM MY LOCAL PAPER HAD AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE RECALL OF 800,000 VEHICLES DUE TO CORROSION AFFECTING THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM LEADING TO LOW-SPEED CRASHES.  MY VEHICLE IS A 2002 AVALANCHE AND IS PART OF THAT RECALL.   WHEN I CALLED GM THEY INFORMED ME IT WAS THE \"ANTI-LOCK BRAKES SENSOR.\"    MY THOUGHT IS IF THE SENSOR IS AFFECTED BY THE CORROSION, THE CORROSION ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE RAPID DETERIORATION OF THE ROTORS AND THAT AFFECTED THE BRAKE PADS.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT SHOULD ALSO BE RECALLED ALONG WITH THE SENSOR.

APPROXIMATELY 1 WEEK AGO, I FOUND THAT THE LEFT SIDE CABLE HAD BROKEN. I WAS GOING TO CALL MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP TODAY, BUT , ON MY WAY TO DROP MY BOYS OFF AT SCHOOL, THE GATE ONCE AGAIN FELL DOWN.  I STOPPED AND ASKED MY 13 Y.O. TO SLAM THE GATE.  WHEN HE TRIED TO DO THIS, THE GATE BOUNCED BACK INTO HIS FACE AND JAMMED.  WHEN I GOT OUT AND LOOKED, I SAW THAT THE RIGHT SIDE HINGE WAS DISLOCATED, THE RIGHT BOTTOM OF THE GATE WAS DAMAGED, THE LEFT REAR TAILLIGHT WAS BROKEN, THERE WAS A GOUGE ON THE LEFT EDGE OF THE GATE, AND A MINOR PAINT SCRATCH ON THE GATE NEAR THE GOUGE.

THE TRAILER WAS BALANCED SO PERFECTLY THAT BY THE TIME I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY GET OFF THE ROAD, THE TIRE CASING WAS STILL INFLATED AND THE TRAILER WAS HOLDING THE TRUCK UP IN THE REAR.  THIS AND THE LACK OF SPEED WERE PROBABLY THE ONLY REASON I DID NOT LOSE CONTROL, BECAUSE I AM SURE THAT UNDER NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS THE CASING WOULD HAVE BLOWN.*AK",

MY VEHICLE WAS IN THE CHEVY SHOP FOR UNRELATED REPAIRS AND THEY DID NOT MENTION OR PERFORM THIS TSB, NOR DID THEY NOTIFY ME TO HAVE IT REPAIRED. THE PARKING/EMERGENCY BRAKE FAILED TO FUNCTION WITHOUT WARNING AND CHEVY KNEW ABOUT IT YET CHOSE NOT TO INFORM ME.*AK",
