The vehicle was no longer under my control and crashed backwards  into a large tree  which held it from crashing farther, and a small tree on the side  which held it from rolling down into a brook. The vehicle is available for inspection upon request and I would prefer that it be inspected. No vehicles or pedestrians were in the street when the vehicle lost all control without human assistance.  The passenger is front passenger seat was taken to ER and has since been seeing a doctor. The problem has not been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer  or other service center. The police were at scene of accident right after it occurred. No lights, messages, or other symptoms gave any warning before the vehicle started  racing and immediately went out of control with no control over speed, brakes or steering The consumer provided photos and police report.",
