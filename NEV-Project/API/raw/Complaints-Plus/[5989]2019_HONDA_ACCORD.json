Then, all the warning lights start to appear on the dashboard. And they stay on for about 30 - 40 mins then they disappear but themselves. Stopping the car and turning it back on doesn't make them disappear.  I've taken the car to the deanship and they said it was the alignment of the tires and that they fixed it but as soon as I drove off the dealership it happened again. I happens every single time I drive. I'm afraid to take the freeway because the self breaking system is so abrupt that it's a miracle that I've not been hit by another yet. I've had this issue since at least 25th of January of this year 2022.  For a car to apply breaks by itself because I'm making a slight turn is dangerous and it's only a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured or worse. I was scared today because I was going 27miles an hour on a regular street when the car applied breaks by itself and the car behind me honked at me. But I never even touched the break paddle. Please take this issue seriously, it's very dangerous to drive like this.",

I called the dealership and the car was taken in on Saturday, March 26th, 2022.  When they moved the car, they told me the brakes felt squishy.  On Tuesday, March 29th, 2022, I received a call from dealership.  I was told the car didn't throw any codes and Honda would not let them fix the brake booster.  I was then told, my Accord had a test booster put on it by Honda.  I was never notified of this before purchasing car.  Had I been told, I would not have bought car.  I was told this is normal for the brake system to do, per Honda of North America.  If this is normal, how come it started 2 weeks ago and not 3 years ago??  There is something wrong with the brakes on this car and I would like the booster to be replaced.  I've been in contact with Stirling Honda in Longview WA who tried to get Honda to approve booster replacement.  I've also been in contact with Honda of Burlington, WA as they called to see if I was going to return car or buy it(I'm leasing).  Honda of Burlington has been less than helpful.  Been told, Honda will not replace and there's nothing wrong with the car.  Brake pedal should not be going to floor.  When I start car, brake pedal will go to approximately 1\" from floor.  I've also had issues with car braking on Freeway...there isn't a car in front of me.  I have a picture of brake pedal going to floor while my car is parked in my driveway.

After the engine light came on along with other warning lights, like a Christmas tree and taking the vehicle to a Honda dealership with a almost 3700.00 repair bill for a vehicle with with under 88,000 miles. The dealership said the vehicle needed a head gasket. The problem is the dealership did not provide the error code numbers. They just gave a price due too coolant going into cylinder number 3. I asked the service rep for a break down the for repairs, which he said was provided. The only thing provided was coolant leaking into cylinder 3 with no codes that the dealership found with the engine light on. I filed a complaint with Honda to off set the repair cost. Mind you we are talking about a head gasket. Honda denied the claim and referred to lack of maintenance. When I told the representative I do my maintenance. He said it was because the dealership wasn\u2019t making money. Who in their right mind would pay 144.00 an hour maintenance when they can\u2019t be up front and provide codes that were thrown on engine light for repair bill. I think NHTSA needs to investigate Honda\u2019s technical service bulletins regarding cylinder misfires in 1,2,3 and 4. I am quite skeptical that a dealership can not list error codes on a repair estimate  that they aren\u2019t hiding something. My family will never purchase another Honda and I will share this Story with everyone I know. Something is being hidden if the dealership doesn\u2019t provide error codes.

My conclusion is that the vehicle does not immediately recognize the steering input.  The problem is most pronounced when traveling straight, on the highway and needing to make a mild lane correction to maintain the lane.  The vehicle does not immediately recognize the mild steering input until the steering wheel has been turned significantly.  Once the steering wheel has been turned significantly and the steering input is recognized, the power steering engages, causing a sudden jerk and a need to recover control.

When I saw there were other occurrences of this issue, I had to file this complaint. I believe this needs to be a recall issue before more serious injuries or fatalities occur. Below it asked when it happened, how many miles on the car, and the answer is multiple times at multiple speed and first started at around 20,000 miles. Again it has gotten worse over time. the car currently has about 46,000 miles",

So I put the car in neutral and pushed the gas and I was correct the engine had no RPMs. This caused a huge safety issue to myself and the people driving near me. As I had ZERO control over the vehicle on an incline. The cars coming toward me and the ones behind me had ZERO issues with their vehicles going up this hillside. I tried three times to shut car off and back on so it would give me a few seconds of acceleration, allowing me to get up the hill a few more feet before shutting off again and possibly causing an accident.  When I took it to my Honda dealer they stated computer showed no issues with the vehicle. And they have not heard of the engine  shutting down or not having RPMs with snow on the ground. They recommended that I have tracking control off next time allowing me full control vs. the computer of the car however, I DID have it off. Once they heard that statement they informed me I have no other options.    Honda did tell me when driving in snow other messages can go off and the car is still SAFE to drive. Which it needs to be as this area has tons of snow. However, that is not the case if the car just shuts off. Prior to the issue, the car kept beeping non stop with warning of break system & adaptive cruise control. My sensors were wiped off prior to the car shutting off. Yet again you can't keep a sensor spotless driving on a highway with snow.  Two of the warning lights that showed on my dashboard were not listed in the manual.

Car mileage was 21264 at the time of the crash. The weather at the time of the crash was light rain and with temperature approximately 50F. The car suddenly and for no apparent reason began skidding / fishtailing. I tried steering to regain control of the vehicle and applying the brakes to slow down, but the car continued fishtailing. I did not feel the anti lock brakes engage at any point during the skid. I went into the left lane, and struck the center concrete barrier, causing the airbags to deploy and the car to come to rest in the left lane.  3 symptoms appeared the day of the crash which had never happened before:  1) Several hours before the crash, the vehicle began handling strangely. It felt like there was either steering or brake input from the land keeping assist / adaptive cruise control / traction control systems which was \"fighting\" me and causing the vehicle to swerve slightly. These handling anomalies occurred randomly about 10 times immediately before the crash.  2) About 2 hours before the crash, the check engine light began flashing and there was a loss of engine power. I pulled over and restarted the car, which seemed to resolve the check engine light / power loss.  3) At one point the adaptive cruise control turned itself off and gave a message about traction conditions.  To my knowledge the problem has not been confirmed or reproduced, and the vehicle has not yet been inspected by Honda, my insurer, or anyone else. As of Jan 6, the vehicle is currently in a yard near Altoona PA awaiting assessment, and is available for inspection upon request. I informed Honda about the crash on Jan 6, 2022.

Also, it requires the driver to focus mostly on centering the car inside the lane and less time on wider observation of the surroundings. During an emergency maneuver to avoid any object on the road, the car may not respond to the driver\u2019s input as intended. As shown in the attached video, as the driver tries to turn the steering wheel clockwise from the centered position, the steering wheel doesn\u2019t move a bit as if something is tightly holding it. When more turning force is applied by the driver, the steering wheel loosens up instantly which creates an over turning of the car. Although the degree of the movement appears small in the video, this is big enough to noticeably shift the car within a highway lane. I am very afraid that if the car will let driver turn the steering during an emergency situation.

The problem is more reproduceable in certain condition.The temperature should be around 50 degrees or below. The car must be driven for 30min or longer on highway at around 70mph.

Within about a block the car unexpectedly braked hard and slowed down from about 40 to 15 mph.  I attempted to press on the gas to avoid causing an accident but, the car continued at the slower speed and did not react to my gas press.  This issue then cleared and I was able to accelerate.  This was very scary but to make it worse about a 1/2 block later my car veered to the left and out of my lane, again at this point I was on high alert and the veer was not correct.  I was able to gain control and get the vehicle back in the correct lane.        I then pulled into a parking lot(~1 block later).  I tried to document all of the warnings at this time.  I called Randy Kuehl Honda and decided to drive back roads to the dealership(~4 miles).  Prior to arriving(~3.8 miles into drive), additional warnings were displayed.   I arrived at the dealership and they said that the issue was because there was a crack in my brake light and water had gotten in.  But I am having a hard time accepting that because of a busted taillight it is normal/acceptable/safe for the car to brake and swerve and lose all of the indicated systems.  Seems like a pretty big SAFETY CONCERN.  I can quickly find other instances similar to mine on the internet.  Below is a list of all the warnings I was able to remember.  I also noticed while I was parked that the red \"BRAKE\" was displayed but I did not have the parking brake on. ---Initial warnings Electric Parking Brake System Problem(SP), Parking Brake Not Available Brake SP Brake Performance May Be Reduced Brake Hold SP.

POST THAT I CALLED HONDA ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE AND THEY ASKED ME TO MOVE TO A SAFE LOCATION AND CALL THEM AGAIN. I TRIED TO DRIVE THE CAR AGAIN AND DROVE COUPLE OF MILES WHERE MY CAR FINALLY STOPPED MOVING AND SMOKE STARTED COMING FROM THE EXHAUST. SCARED WE QUICKLY EVACUATED THE CAR AND MOVED TO A SAFE LOCATION AT 8:23 PM. POST THAT COPS CAME TO ASK WHY WE STOPPED THERE, WE EXPLAINED THEM THE SITUATION. WE WERE TOLD TO STOP THE ENGINE AND WAIT THERE TILL THE TOWING CAR ARRIVED. I HAD SO MUCH TRUST IN HONDA AND WE ARE SO TRAUMATIZED WITH THIS SITUATION AND I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE HOW THIS HAPPENED. THIS IS A BRAND NEW CAR WITH TOTAL MILES OF 657 MILES. I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS FROM A BRAND-NEW CAR. WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO ESCAPE DEATH ON THE HIGHWAY. WE WERE EXHAUSTED AND TERRIFIED WITH THIS EVENT.  YESTERDAY HONDA SERVICE CENTER COMPANY CALLED AND TOLD THAT THE THE TURBO CHARGER FAILED INTERNALLY, CAUSING OIL TO GO INTO THE EXHAUST SYSTEM. THIS CAUSED CONTAMINATION OF THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND DAMAGED THE OXYGEN SENSORS.    I AM NOT SURE IF I CAN OR ANYONE CAN TRUST HONDA EVER AGAIN. IF SOMETHING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME OR MY FAMILY WILL HONDA BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.    QUESTION IS DO YOU STILL TRUST HONDA ?",
