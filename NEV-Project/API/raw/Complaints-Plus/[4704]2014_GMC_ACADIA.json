        "summary": "I purchased my 2014 GMC Acadia Denali July 29th, 2021.  It has been back to the dealer five times, with repairs not being completed.  Within weeks of purchasing it, the Service Air Bag light came on, and won't go off.  The low tire light came on. The serpentine belt broke and had to be replaced, and the power steering pump started making horrendous noises and leaking fluid.  I bought an expensive service contract, and of course these repairs are not covered.  I also had them repair tires twice, and ended up having to replace the two front tires, after being told there was nothing wrong with them, except one had a screw.  They also said that tire rotation was causing the lights to go off, and wasn't reset, and supposedly they reset it to reflect where the tires are on the vehicle in relation to the TPMS's.  Well, two tires lost air constantly, and there were numerous leaks.  I finally took the vehicle to a real tire store for tire replacement.   The estimate for the driver's side airbag system replacement is $1400 pre-tax, and the power steering pump replacement is $1100, pre-tax.  So within two months, I've had nothing but trouble; spent $380 on two new tires, and will have the cost of these repairs on top of the extra $2200 I spent on a service contract.   The vehicle is beautiful, and seemingly was well-maintained, but it immediately began breaking down.  I've had very limited use of it since July 29th when I bought it.  (it's now October 6th, 2021).  I have a meeting with the owner of the dealership tomorrow, October 7th, at the suggestion of the dealership's repair manager, as well as the salesman.",

She had no warning and the area had no shoulder for her to pull off into so she had to come to a complete stop in the right lane of the highway. People are doing speeds well above 70MPH, I would hate to think of what could have happened if a person or line of vehicles could not change lanes in time; very serious injuries and possibly death for all invovled. Fortunatly, she had the sense to put the car in park (highway lane) and completed a key cycle thus restarting the vehicle and then obviously accelerating quickly to get out of harms way. As people are swirving out of her lane and honking at her.   I put our VIN into the NHTSA site and see the vehicle has no outstanding recalls. Then i search just the model year and come across a recall (14V-614, GM recall number 14515) that appears to be the same issue we may have had. In the vehicle information section of the 573 it lists:  Descriptive Information : 2014 GMC Acadia Production Dates : JUN 27, 2013 - SEP 26, 2013  Plugging my VIN into a VIN decoder, i see that my vehicle was built July 26, 2013; this falls within the suspect time of this recall. Why have I not been notified of this recall? Why is the NHTSA tool not show my vehicle as being affected?   This could have been a very a tragic ending.

ON MONDAY AUGUST 5 WHILE I WAS DRIVING THE ACADIA, BOTH THE WARNING LIGHT AND MESSAGE \"SERVICE AIR BAG\" CAME ON AND STAYED ON WHILE DRIVING.  ON MONDAY AUGUST 5 I DROVE THE ACADIA TO A GM DEALERSHIP AS SOON AS IT OPENED.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID THERE WERE TWO DIAGNOSIS CODES FOR TWO SEPARATE FAILURES RELATING TO THE AIR BAGS.  THE FIRST WAS CODE B0022 (WHICH THE DEALERSHIP SAID WAS RELATED TO A WIRING FAILURE).  THE DEALERSHIP ADVISED THIS FAILURE CODE OF B0022 WAS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY PURSUANT TO GM SPECIAL COVERAGE ADJUSTMENT NUMBER 15804.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THE SECOND DIAGNOSIS CODE WAS B0058 (WHICH THE DEALERSHIP SAID WAS A FAILED SENSOR).  THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS NEEDED TO BE FIXED IN ORDER FOR THE AIRBAGS TO WORK.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID, HOWEVER, THAT REPLACEMENT OF THE SENSOR WAS NOT COVERED UNDER ADJUSTMENT 15804.

THE NOISE IT MAKES SOUNDS LIKE A MARBLE ROLLING ON A WOODEN FLOOR FOR ABOUT 1-2 SECONDS AND THEN CLICK AND THEN THE GEAR SHIFTS.  THE DEALER SAID THEY DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING BUT I DO AS WELL AS OTHER PASSENGERS DO EVERY DAY.  ADDITIONALLY, WHEN TURNING THE VEHICLE AT A SLOW RATE OF SPEED AND THEN ACCELERATING, THE ENGINE SLAMS INTO GEAR WHEN BETWEEN 10-15 MPH BUT ONLY AFTER A TURN AND AN ATTEMPT AT ACCELERATION.  ALSO, MY ACADIA IS NOT A VEHICLE UNDER THE \"FAULTY GAS GAUGE\" RECALL HOWEVER ONCE MY VEHICLE IS BELOW 1/4 TANK THE NEEDLE ON THE GAS GAUGE WILL JUMP FROM 1/8 TANK TO 1/16, BACK UP TO 1/8 OF A TANK ALL WHILE DRIVING ON FLAT ROADWAYS. CONCURRENTLY, THE RANGE FOR THE FUEL ON THE DIGITAL SCREEN GOES FROM 95 TO 58 TO 72 ALL WHILE DRIVING WITH CRUISE CONTROL ON AT A CONSISTENT SPEED.  LASTLY, THE VEHICLE HAS THE DENALI GRILL WHICH LEAVES MINIMAL AIRFLOW FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  UP TO THREE HOURS AFTER TURNING THE VEHICLE OFF (IN A COOL GARAGE) YOU CAN STILL FEEL THE HEAT COMING FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT IF YOU PLACE YOUR HAND IN FRONT OF THE GRILL.  COULD THIS BE A POSSIBLE FIRE HAZARD?  ALL OF THESE ISSUES BEGAN WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE WITH 60 MILES ON IT AND CONTINUE NOW AT 15,500 MILES.  I DRIVE FREQUENTLY AND CAN TELL YOU THAT I DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN MY VEHICLE BUT AM UNSURE WHAT TO DO AS THE DEALER HAS TOLD ME THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.  THE ONLY RECALL FOR MY VEHICLE IS THE SEATBELT ISSUE BUT I THINK THERE ARE SERIOUS ENGINE PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY GM.  *TR",

I PULLED OVER AND ALLOWED CARS TO GO AROUND ME AS I TRIED TO RESTART THE VEHICLE, 3 TIMES, AND IT  WOULD NOT START. I CALLED ONSTAR TO SEE IF THEY COULD DO A CAR CHECK AND TOLD ME NOTHING WAS WRONG. AFTER AN HOUR OF BEING STUCK ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH A CAR THAT WOULD NOT START, ONSTAR GOT ME A TOW TRUCK AND TOWED ME TO THE DEALER SHIP. THE DEALER SHIP AT FIRST COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE CAR AND TRIED TO SEE IF IT WAS THE INDICATOR LIGHT, AFTER 3 DAYS THE CALLED ME AND INFORMED ME THAT THE BATTERY HAD A BAD CELL WHICH HAD CAUSED THE CARS SYSTEM TO SHUT DOWN IMMEDIATELY WHILE I WAS DRIVING. THEY GAVE ME A NEW BATTERY AND THAT CLEARED UP THAT PROBLEM. I AM VERY CONCERNED WITH THIS HAPPENING TO SOMEONE ON A HIGHWAY, IMAGINE IF SOMEONE COULD NOT CONTROL THERE CAR AND SPEED WHILE DOING 70 MPH IN THE FAST LANE, THIS COULD EASILY CAUSE A CAR CRASH!!! I WAS FORTUNATE TO BE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD ONLY GOING 25 MPH BUT IT STILL COULD HAVE CAUSED A ACCIDENT SINCE THERE WAS CARS BEHIND ME. IT WAS A SCARY SITUATION AS I REALIZED I HAD NO CONTROL OF MY CAR, PLEASE MAKE PEOPLE AWARE OF THIS BECAUSE I HAVE HEARD OF GM HAVE MORE BAD BATTERIES!  *TR",
