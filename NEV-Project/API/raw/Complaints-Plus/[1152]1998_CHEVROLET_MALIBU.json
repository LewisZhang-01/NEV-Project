THE C5 SUDDENLY TOOK OFF ON IT'S OWN, THE THROTTLE IN A FULL OPEN POSITION, WITHOUT THE DRIVER STEPPING ON  THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL. THE BRAKES WERE NOT EFFECTIVE SOON ENOUGH TO AVOID THE ACCIDENTS.

AT AROUND 5,000 MILES I WENT TO THE DEALER BECAUSE THE ROTORS WERE WARPED AND THEY WERE SUBSEQUENTLY RESURFACED.  AT AROUND 13,000 MILES I HAD TO HAVE THE ROTORS REPLACED BECAUSE THEY WERE WARPED (THE WERE REPLACED WITH AFTER MARKET ROTORS).  ALTHOUGH WARPING DID OCCUR AFTER THE ROTORS WERE REPLACED WITH A NON OEM PART, IT DID NOT OCCUR AS OFTEN AND AS BADLY.  ABOUT ONE MONTH AGO I HAD THE FRONT BRAKES RESURFACED AND BENDIX PADS PLACED.  WARPING STARTED AFTER A FEW DAYS THAT THE BREAKS WERE DONE.  THE MECHANIC INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS NOT THE ROTOR THAT WAS AT FAULT.  IT WAS THE ENTIRE BRAKE DESIGN OF THE MALIBU.  THE BRAKES SIMPLY CANNOT HOLD BACK THE WEIGHT OF THE CAR ON SUCH SMALL ROTORS.  BECAUSE OF THE RELATIVELY SMALL SURFACE AREA OF SUCH SMALL ROTORS, THEY TEND TO HEAT UP WAY TO EARLY CAUSING SEVERE BRAKE FADING....THE REASON WHY I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE MECHANIC TO HAVE THE BRAKES DONE TO BEGIN WITH.  TODAY, AS I WAS DRIVING IN LIGHT TRAFFIC, AS I APPLIED THE BRAKES AT AROUND 25 MILES AN HOUR, IT FELT AS IF I WASN'T PRESSING THE BRAKE AT ALL AND I REAR ENDED A VEHICLE CAUSING A LOT OF DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE...SOMEWHERE AROUND $2,500 WORTH.  AFTER ALLOWING THE CAR TO SIT FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR I DECIDED TO TEST THE BRAKES BY APPLYING THEM IN THE SAME MANNER AS BEFORE...AND THE VEHICLE STOPPED AS IT SHOULD.  THE ONLY POSSIBLE EXPLANATION IS BRAKE FADE DO TO THE ROTORS OVERHEATING.

RADLEY AND CHEVY, I AM QUITE SURE THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF THE NUMEROUS CONSUMER COMPLAINTS AND PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BRAKE SYSTEM OF THE 1998 CHEVROLET MALIBU, BUT JUST IN CASE I WILL EXPOUNDED ON THE ISSUE.  MY WIFE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM YOUR DEALERSHIP ON 22 AUG 98.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER WE NOTED SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKES GRINDING AND SQUEAKING. THE FOLLOWING ARE DATES THAT THE VEHICLE WAS BROUGHT IN FOR BRAKES PROBLEMS: 02/04/99 - 8K MILESMS. RADLEY, THAT MAKES A GRAND TOTAL OF TEN TIMES THE CAR HAS HAD NOTED BRAKE PROBLEMS WITH NO RESOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.  THERE IS A DEFINITE MANUFACTURING PROBLEM WITH THESE BRAKES THAT I EXPECT FIXED.  I HAD EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THIS ISSUE WHEN THE BRAKES AND ROTORS HAD TO BE REPLACED AT 20K MILES, APPARENTLY NO ONE CARED THEN AS NOW.  I HAVE SPOKEN WITH CHEVROLET CONSUMER COMPLAINT DIVISION, JEFF MERRITT AND IKE CHRIS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AT LENGTH AND I MUST SAY THE TOTAL LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY GROWS MORE EVIDENT.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD EVERYTHING FROM DRIVING HABITS TO LACK OF SERVICE.  THIS PATRONIZATION IS INFURIATING. THE BOTTOM LINE IS CHEVROLET KNOWS FULL WELL THAT THEY PLACED A BRAKING SYSTEM DESIGNED FOR A CHEVY CAVALIER ON THE MALIBU.  DO NOT TRY AND TELL ME THAT IT IS NORMAL FOR ROTORS TO WARP AND GO BAD EVERY 20K MILES; I DO NOT ACCEPT THAT ANSWER.  WHEN I CALLED SEVERAL GARAGES AND ASK WHAT VEHICLE REQUIRES THE MOST BRAKES SERVICE AND REPLACEMENT ROTORS \u0016 THE ANSWER WAS \u0013MALIBU AND ALERO\u0014.  I CALLED SEVEN DIFFERENT SHOPS IN THE AREA AND TWO OTHER CHEVY DEALERSHIPS AND RECEIVED THE SAME ANSWER AT EACH PLACE.  YOU MAY WANT TO NOTE THE FOLLOWING COMPLAINTS FILES AT THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION, OFFICE OF DEFECTS INVESTIGATION, CONSUMER COMPLAINTS DATABASE.  AS OF WHEN I RESEARCHED THE DATABASE I DISCOVERED 865 CONSUMER COMPLAINTS 365 OF WHICH ARE BRAKE RELATED.*AK",

THE A/C CONTROL HEAD NEEDED TO BE REPALCED AFTER 43.000 MILES. THE A/C CYCLED ON AND OFF. LET ME TELL YOU THAT GM/CHEVY KNOWS THERE ARE PROBLEMS AND STILL REQUIRE YOU TO PAY FOR THE PARTS UNTIL THEY FIND A SOLUTION. ANYWAY, TWO DAYS AFTER I HAD THE A/C CONTROL HEAD REPLACED, THE A/C STARTED TO BLOW OUT HOT AIR. BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER (ROYAL CHEVROLET IN NEW JERSEY) TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED. THEY STATED THERE WAS A HOLE IN THE CONDENSOR AND IT WOULD COST $1200 FOR THE PART. I FOUND IT HARD TO BELEIVE THAT SOMETHING COULD FIT THRU THE GRILL WITHOUT DAMAGING THE GRILL AND PUT A HOLE IN THE CONDENSOR. WHEN I PICKED THE CAR UP, HE THREW THE KEYS ACCROSS THE COUNTER, SAID IT WAS IN THE BACK AND WALKED AWAY. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! 9 MONTHS PAST UNTILL I HAD MY REGULAR DEALER LOOK AT THE CAR. HE TIGHTENED A HOSE AND REPLACED A SEAL AND FREON AT A COST OF $80. A BIG DIFFERENCE. I RECOMMEND THEM. (LYNN CHEVROLET). I HAD THE WATER PUMP REPLACED. A CAMSHAFT SENSOR WAS SHORTED AND HAD TO BE REPLACED. (THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT KEPT COMING ON) I ALSO REPLACED THE HUB BEARING ON BOTH FRONT WHEELS AFTER 60,000 MILES. RECENTLY THE A/C STARTED TO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. I CALLED CHEVY BECAUSE I FEEL I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR REOCCURRING PROBLEMS. THEY COULD CARE LESS ABOUT THE CONSUMER. THEY HAVE YOUR MONEY ALREADY. CHEVY TOLD ME THE ONLY DEALER THAT COULD REPAIR IT ON GOOD FAITH WAS THE DEALER THAT INSTALLED THE PART THE FIRST TIME. THE ONES THE TRIED TO RIP ME OFF. CHEVY JUST DON'T GET IT. THEY LOST ME AS A CUSTOMER. DON'T BUY THIS CAR UNLESS YOU WANT POOR CUSTOMER RELATIONS.*AK",

I CONTACTED SEVERAL ORGINIZATIONS TO SEE IF THIS WAS POSSIBLY RECALLED, IT WASN'T. SINCE THEY WANT $250 FOR THE LIGHT ASSEMBLY I'VE BEEN WAITING TO SEE IF THEY WOULD RECALL THEM CONSIDERING THAT JUST IN THE CENTRAL MASS AREA I HAVE SEEN 2 - 3 DOZEN MALIBU'S WITH THAT STOP LIGHT NOT WORKING. I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET IT WORKING BY TAKING IT APART DRYING IT OUT AND CLEANING THE ELECTRODES WITH A WIRE BRUSH BUT WITHIN A WEEK OF ANY RAIN IT BLOWS OUT AGAIN. I EVEN WENT AS FAR AS TWO WEEKS AGO RESEALING THE SEAL AROUND THE HOUSING AND WHEN WE GOT RAIN THAT DAY WENT OUT AND CHECKED IT AND THERE WAS ABOUT A PINT OF WATER INSIDE.I PULLED THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY OUT STILL TOGETHER, TIPPED IT EVERY WAY POSSIBLE AND COULD NOT GET THE WATER TO LEAK OUT FROM ANYWHERE. I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS  THE STOP LIGHTS. THE OTHER LIGHTS STILL WORK(THE BACKUP, DIRECTIONAL , AND EVEN THE 2 MARKER LIGHTS ON THE SAME BULB AS THE STOP) ITS JUST THE STOP LIGHTS.

FINALLY, I HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR.  THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THAT I TAKIT IN WITH IN A TWO MONTH PERIOD TO HAVE THE STALLING REPAIRED.  ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO, WE WERE COMING BACK FORM VACATION WHEN THE CAR DIED ON US OVER TWENTY TIMES FORM SAN DIEGO TO SACRAMENTO.  AT ONE POINT, WHILE RUNNING, THE CAR WOULD ACCELERATE AND DECCERATE AS IF SOMEONE WAS PUMING THE ACCERATOR IN A RAPID MOTION.  THEN THE CAR WOULD DIE OUT.  I WOULD PULL OVER AND RESTART IT.  AFTER A WHILE, I GOT THE HANG OF IT.  IT WOULD DIE OUT, I WOULD PUT IT IN NUTERAL, AND I WOULD RESTART THE CAR.  IT WAS NIGHT TIME AND IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS EVERY TIME THAT I HAD TO PULL OVER TO RESTART IT.  I WAS WITH MY WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN.  SECOND PROBLEM: THE ABS LIGHT LIT UP WHEN THE CAR HAD 35,800 MILES APPROXIMATLY.  I TOOK IT IN TO THE DEALER AND AT THAT TIME THE LIGHT WAS OUT.  IT WOULD COME ON INTERMITTENLY.  THE DEALER COULD NOT DIAGNOSE A PROBLEM.  AROUND 37,000 MILES, THE ABS WOULD COME ON EVERYOTHER DAY, AND THE CAR WOULD GO INTO AN ABS BRAKE EVERY TIME THE LIGHT WOLD COME ON.  I TOOK THE CAR IN TO THE DEALER AND HAD THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL SENSOR REPLACED.  THAT TOOK CARE OF THE ABS PROBLEM.  I PUT OFF THE REPAIR BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO HAVE IT FIXED.  I HAVE ALSO REPLACED THE BRAKE PADS AT 30,000 MILES AND IT SOULDS LIKE THEY NEED TO BE REPALCED AGAIN. THEY SQUEEK WHEN I BRAKE.  MY PRIMARY CONCERN IS THE CAR'S DEFECT WITH THE STALLING.

I HAVE JUST RECEIVED WRITTEN CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE DEALER NOTED THAT GENERAL MOTORS IS AAWARE OF THIS PROBLEM. MY DEALER TELLS ME THAT THEY WILL COVER ANY FUTURE ROTOR/BRAKE PROBLEMS UP TO 60,000 MILES AND/OR UP TO FIVE YEARS THAT THE VEHICLE WAS PUT IN TO SERVICE. THE SERIOUS CONCERN IS WHY HAS GENERAL MOTORS FAILED TO ISSUE A NATIONWIDE CONSUMER ALERT TO ALL MALIBU OWNERS OF THIS SERIOUS, AND VERY COSTLY, PROBLEM? IT SEEMS OBVIOUS THAT THIS IS A MANUFACTURER/DESIGN TYPE DEFECT THAT, FOR SOME REASSON, IS BEING KEPT VERY QUIET. I DON'T APPRECIATE HAVING TO DIG TO FIND OUT INFORMATION THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FREELY DISPENSED TO ME ASS WELL AS ALL OTHER MALIBU OWNERS. I WONDER HOW MANY CONSUMERS HAVE PAID HARD EARNED MONEY OUT OF THIER POCKETS BECAUSE THEY WERE UNAWARE THAT THIS IS A GM PROBLEM? I AM FULLY PREPARED TO FOLLOW THIS ISSUE THROUGH IN A MORE FORMAL MATTER IF YOU SO ADVISE. I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP AND GUIDANCE. THANK YOU FOR LOOKING INTO THIS SERIOUS SAFETY RELATED MATTER.

THE STEERING WHEEL AND FRONT WHEELS WERE ALIGNED, HOWEVER, THE REAR WHEELS WERE NOT ALIGNED.

THE FRONT BRAKE ROTORS HAVE BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY WARPED, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, FRONT CALIPER RETAINING PINS HAVE FLOWN COMPLETELY OUT WHILE DRIVING AT ABOUT SEVENTY (70) MILES PER HOUR ON THE INTERSTATE.  IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, THE CAR WAS ABLE TO BE DRIVEN TO THE DEALERSHIP, WHERE THEY REPLACED THE PIN AND RE-TOURQED ALL OTHER PINS.  ABOUT A MONTH LATER, ANOTHER PIN FLEW OUT, THIS TIME RESULTING IN AN UNDRIVABLE CAR, LEAVING MY WIFE AND INFANT CHILD STRANDED ON THE SIDE OF THE INTERSTATE AT NIGHT.  THE CAR WAS TOWED IN, AND THE DEALER'S FIX WAS TO REPLACE ALL OF THE CALIPER PINS, IGNORING THE FACT THAT THERE IS CERTAINLY ANOTHER PROBLEM, SUCH AS COMPONENT DESIGN CAUSING THE PINS TO FLY OUT.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.  AFTER REVIEWING THE COMPLAINT LOG AT THE NHTSA WEB SITE AND THROUGH PERSONAL CONTACT WITH OTHER MALIBU OWNERS WITH SIMILAR PROBLEMS, IT IS QUITE APPARENT THAT MY PROBLEMS ARE NOT ISOLATED EVENTS.

REPLACED THE FIRST TIME AND WITHIN 5,000 MILES WAS BACK AGAIN.  CAR'S STEERING WHEEL WOULD SHAKE VIOLENTLY WHENEVER THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED THEREBY DIMINSHING MY CONTROL OVER THE STEERING. WENT BACK TO DEALER AND AGAIN, BRAKE PADS WERE NOT OWRN-LIKE NEW YET ROTOR WARPED. THEY REPLACED THEM BUT CLAIMED IT WAS ACTUALLY MY BAD DRIVING THAT MUST BE THE CAUSE.  I TOOK EXCEPTION TO THAT BEING THAT I HAVE BEEN DRIVING OVER 15 YEARS AND EVEN OWNED A CHEVY CORSICA FOR 10 YEARS AND NEVER EVER HAD THE ROTORS REPLACED.  NEEDLESS TO SAY-FILED COMPLAINT WITH CHEVY CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT BECAUSE THE DEALER CLAIMED IF IT SHOULD HAPPEN A THIRD TIME-THEY WOULD NO LONGER REPLACE ROTORS FOR FREE. I TOLD THEM I WAS SURE IT WOULD HAPPEN A THRID TIME BECAUSE THERE WAS AN OBVIOUS DEFECT THAT THEY DID NOT WANT TO ADMIT. LO AND BEHOLD! 5000 MILES LATER AND HERE I AM AGAIN. VIOLENT SHAKING OF THE STEERING WHEEL WHEN I APPLY THE BRAKES. BEEN THRU THIS 2X ALREADY SO I KNOW THAT THE ROTORS ARE WARPED AGAIN. AND I'M SURE THERE WILL BE A FOURTH TIME-BUT THAT IS WHEN I WILL APPLY MY RIGHTS UNDER NYS LEMON LAW. I HAVE OWNED A CHEVY CORSICA FOR 10 YEARS AND THE MALIBU REPLACED THE CORSICA-WHICH I GAVE TO MY MOM.
