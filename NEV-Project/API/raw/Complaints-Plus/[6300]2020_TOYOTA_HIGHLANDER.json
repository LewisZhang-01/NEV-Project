Often after filling the gas tank completely, the gauge will only register as 3/4 full. Like wise, it is inaccurate when the tank gets low, showing that there is 1/4 tank, when in fact it is nearly empty.   The \"remaining miles\" indicator that displays is likewise inaccurate and often the low fuel indicator light comes on when it shouldn't, and doesn't display when it should.   I have had it to the deal 4 times now for repair. Initially they told me nothing was wrong, then indicated that a software update was necessary. When that didn't fix it, I returned the vehicle and they indicated an instrument panel  sensor chip needed to be replaced. I waited a month for that to happen and it didn't fix the issue.   I then opened a trouble incident with Toyota USA and after several weeks received a call back from the dealer indicating this is a known (presumably still developing) issue and has something to do with a faulty gas tank that causes the readings to be inaccurate. The dealer indicated that they know this will require the gas tank to be replaced but that they don't have parts to do this and will contact me at some point in the future.   This is a serious safety issue, as it could lead to the vehicle running out of gas while driving, without any indication that the fuel is low. The only way to have any certainty regarding the fuel level is to do a calculation each time you drive based on the estimated fuel economy and # of miles driven since the last fill up.",

When the contact first attempted to use the brake kit, her and her husband had connected the equipment per the instructions and brake kit showed the letter \"C\" which meant the part was connected. As the contact started driving the vehicle, a NC (not connected) message had appeared on the brake kit. The contact decided to drive the vehicle back to her home and attempted to reconnect the brake system as instructed but the failure persisted. Upon investigation, the contact discovered that the equipment had been placed under NHTSA Campaign Number: 20E033000 (Electrical System). The contact reached out to the independent mechanics, the one who sold the part and the other that installed it, and neither were aware of the recall. The contact also called the manufacturer and had written a letter to obtain the replacement part however, the contact had not heard back from the manufacturer. The vehicle was not repaired.

        "summary": "My Toyota Highlander is a hybrid and there is an ongoing problem with the brakes under certain conditions. When you are slowing the vehicle down, with your foot on the the brakes, there is a point under 10 miles an hour, where the brakes appear to let go and you must quickly exert dramatically more pressure on the brakes to stop the car. Fortunately it has not resulted in an accident because my wife and I are aware of the potential danger. The danger is, this occurs when you are stopping at a stop sign or crosswalk, pulling into a parking space, or around pedestrians, even pulling into our garage. I have own previous Toyota Hybrids and this vehicle behaves very differently. In my opinion the route of the problem may be the regenerative braking. As you step on the brakes the regenerative braking supplies most of the braking power and then at a slower speed the regenerative braking abruptly  dis engages. It seem there should be a way to smooth the erratic behavior of the brakes. I have filed my concerns with the Toyota customer experience center in November of 2020 under my name and file number #2011280027. The car is available anytime to demonstrate the problem, there are no open recalls for this VIN#, and I have been told there are no service bulletins for this problem.

TOYOTA ADVERTISED A 600 MILE RANGE TO THE HIGHLANDER HYBRID. THE 600 MILE FUEL RANGE SEEMS VERY OFF WITH THE 2020 HIGHLANDER HYBRID. I HAVE THE XLE AND ALWAYS HAVE KEPT IT IN ECO MODE. I'VE DRIVEN OVER A THOUSAND MILES ON THE CAR, BUT THE MILE RANGE ESTIMATE ON THE CAR IS INACCURATE AND SEEMS TO BE OFF A LOT IF IT'S SUPPOSED TO GET 600 MILES TO A TANK.    MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHEN THE TANK IS EMPTY (THE DASH SAYS I HAD 5 MILES LEFT TO EMPTY), THE GAS TANK ONLY HOLDS AROUND 13 GALLONS EVEN THOUGH THE FUEL TANK CAPACITY IS SUPPOSEDLY 17.1 GALLONS. THOSE 4 GALLONS MAKE FOR 140 MILES LESS DISTANCE ON A TANK. IF I WAIT AND KEEP ON FORCING THE GAS IN SLOWLY, I CAN GET 15 GALLONS BUT I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF HAVING TO KEEP ON PUSHING THE GAS NOZZLE UNTIL THE GAS SPEWS OUT OF THE TANK JUST TO GET 15 GALLONS IN. I KNOW TOYOTA HAS BEEN HAVING GAS TANK ISSUES IN OTHER MODELS RECENTLY. ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I BOUGHT THE CAR WAS FOR THE FUEL TANK CAPACITY AND RANGE.
