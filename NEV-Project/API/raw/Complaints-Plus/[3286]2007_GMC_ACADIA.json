I DECIDED NOT TO DRIVE MY GMC UNTIL I COULD GET INTO A GM DEALER.  I CALLED TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH A LOCALE GM DEALER 2ND WEEK OF JANUARY TOOK TIME FROM WORK TO ADDRESS ISSUE AND TO ADDRESS THE TAILGATE RECALL.  I ASK THEM TO FIND OUT WHY MY AIRBAG LIGHT WAS ON  AND IF SERVICE WAS NEEDED.  IT WAS DETERMINED BY THE TECH THAT THERE WAS HEAVY WATER IN MY VEHICLE THAT LEAKED INTO THE AIR BAG MODULAR THAT IS LOCATED BEHIND THE GLOVE BOX.   IT ALSO DAMAGE THE AIRBAG SENSOR LOCATED IN THE FLOOR UNDER THE RUG.  MY HUSBAND ADVISED A REP AT THE DEALER THAT THE ISSUE MAY BE THE WATER CHANNELS. BUT  PER THE TECH IT WAS DETERMINE THAT THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WAS CAUSE OF THE WATER PER THE TECH THE DRAINS ON MY SUNROOF WERE WORKING AND WAS NOT THE ISSUE FOR THE WATER. I WAS ADVISED IT WAS GOING TO COST ME $4200? TO HAVE THE AIRBAG FLOOR SENSORS, AIRBAG MODULE REPLACE, NEW RUG INSTALLED AND WINDSHIELD REPLACED.   IT COST ME $3200 TO FIX WITHOUT HAVING THE RUG REPLACED SINCE MY CONCERN WAS THE AIRBAG COMMUNICATED WITH THE VEH.  NO VEHICLE FOR 5 DAYS, RUG AIRED/DRIED BY DEALER AND FIXED. I GOT  VEH BACK ON FRIDAY  LESS THAN 72 HOURS LATER CALL TO GM DEALER.

THE NEXT DAY I WENT TO MY LOCAL GMC DEALER TO DISCUSS PROBLEM AND REPAIRS. THE SERVICE WRITER STATED \"WE KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE POWER STEERING SYSTEMS ON THESE VEHICLES, AND THEY TYPICALLY FAIL IN THE 70 TO 90 THOUSAND MILE RANGE.\" THEN THEY WANTED $2000 FOR REPAIRS. REPAIRS WHICH ARE GETTING DONE CHEAPER AT MY LOCAL GARAGE.  MY PROBLEM WITH THIS, IS THAT GM KNOWS THERE IS A SAFETY DEFECT WITH THIS VEHICLE, BUT HAS DONE NOTHING TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM, OTHER THAN MAKE PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY HAVE TO SPEND HUGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO FIX. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE SAME ACTION THE COMPANY TOOK IN THE IGNITION ISSUE THEY ARE CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH.  YES, I AM ANGRY AT GM FOR NOT BACKING THEIR PRODUCT, BUT THAT IS NOT WHY I AM WRITING TO YOU. I AM WRITING TO YOU, BECAUSE I AM A FIRST RESPONDER, AND SEE FIRST HAND WHAT CAN HAPPENS WITH SAFETY ISSUES TO VEHICLES.   WHAT IF THIS ISSUE HAPPENED TO SOMEONE WHO KNOWS LITTLE ABOUT CARS, OTHER THAN HOW TO FUEL AND DRIVE THEM SAFELY? WHAT IF IT WAS A FAMILY AND THEIR CHILDREN IN THE VEHICLE WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND THEY DID HAVE AN ACCIDENT?  I UNDERSTAND ALL HYPOTHETICALS, BUT A SAFETY  ISSUE NONE THE LESS.

THE TRANSMISSION MADE A LOUD GRINDING NOISE AND WOULD NOW LONGER MOVE IN REVERSE.      I HAD THE CAR TOWED FROM MY HOUSE TO A LOCAL TRUSTED MECHANIC.  THE MECHANIC STATED THAT THE WAVEPLATE FAILED.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THIS WAS A KNOW DEFICIENCY IN THESE VEHICLES AND THAT THE TRANSMISSION WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED OR REBUILT.  I HAD TO SPEND $3950 TO REBUILD THE TRANSMISSION ON A 2007 VEHICLE WITH 80000 MILES.   I WOULD APPRECIATE A REIMBURSEMENT FROM GM FOR THIS OBVIOUS QUALITY PROBLEM.  *TR",

NEARLY GOT IN AN ACCIDENT MERGING ONTO THE FREEWAY, EXITED FIRST OFFRAMP, PULLED INTO NEIGHBORHOOD AND TURNED INTO DRIVEWAY TO DO A THREE POINT TURN TO PARK ON THE SIDE OF STREET.  PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE LIGHTLY TAPPED THE PEDAL, AND INSTEAD IT SPED FORWARD AS THOUGH THE GAS PEDAL WAS PINNED TO THE FLOOR.  WE WENT DEEP INTO THE FRONT YARD OF HOUSE STOPPING JUST SHORT OF THE HOUSE.   AAA CAME AND TOWED THE CAR TO THE CLOSEST GM DEALER.  AAA DRIVER TESTED REVERSE AND IT WOULD ONLY GO FORWARD.    HE SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.  SO GRATEFUL THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN MINUTES BEFORE IN THE PRESCHOOL PARKING LOT WHICH IS A U SHAPE WHERE THE PARENTS LINE UP AND THE TEACHERS BRING THE KIDS OUT.  THE EXPERIENCE WAS TERRIFYING.  WE PARKED NEXT TO AN ACADIA YESTERDAY AND MY 4 YEAR OLD SAID \"MOMMY WE SHOULD TELL THEM THEY HAVE A BAD CAR.\" CALLED GM IMMEDIATELY AND EVERY DAY SINCE (2 WEEKS) - NO RESPONSE, I AM JUST SHUFFLED BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES.  MY CAR IS STILL SITTING IN THE DEALER'S LOT.  MY CAR ALSO HAD A PURGE VALUE PROBLEM CAUSING IT NOT TO START AFTER GETTING GAS, AND A POWER STEERING PROBLEM.  IT IS ONE THING FOR THE TRANSMISSION TO FAIL AT 64,000 MILES AND ANOTHER FOR IT TO ALMOST DRIVE YOU THROUGH SOMEONE'S HOUSE.  GM DOES NOT SEEM TO CARE.  *TR",

THE OTHER ISSUE INVOLVED PUTTING THE AUTOMOBILE INTO REVERSE ,NOT ONLY AT TIMES IT WOULDN'T GO INTO REVERSE BUT INSTEAD WOULD REVERT TO A NEUTRAL POSITION, UNTIL YOU STARTED ALL OVER AGAIN WITH THE PROCESS OF PUTTING IT BACK INTO PARK AND THEN BACK INTO REVERSE.    NEVER WAS THERE A LIGHT NOR A WARNING BY THE CARS SENSORS OR ANY OTHER SYMPTOMS THAT WOULD GIVE AN OWNER A WARNING THAT THERE WOULD BE  A PROBLEM COMING SOON.    IN ANY EVENT, AFTER HAVING THE SYMPTOMS DESCRIBED ABOVE THE CAR SOMEHOW DROPPED INTO FIRST GEAR AND CANNOT SHIFT FROM THAT POSITION AND FINALLY, THE TRANSMISSION LIGHT CAME ON.    AT THE MOMENT, I AM IN THE PROCESS OF FILING A COMPLAINT WITH GM AND AT THE ADVICE OF THE GM REPRESENTATIVE, THEY ADVISE ME TO HAVE THE DEALERSHIP LOOK INTO THE SITUATION.

THE VEHICLE REACHED 35 MPH AND ALTHOUGH THE SPEEDOMETER STATED 35MPH THE VEHICLE STOPPED MOVING AND STALLED AND STARTED MAKING A CHURNING NOISE COMING FROM THE ENGINE.  AT THIS POINT MY FRONT END WAS IN TRAFFIC UNDER THE LIGHT THAT WAS NOW TURNING RED SO I HAD TO THINK QUICK AND PUT ON MY FLASHERS TO ALERT THE OTHER DRIVERS THAT I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTIES AS I COULDN'T GET THE TRUCK TO MOVE.  WHEN I PRESSED THE GAS PEDAL THE ENGINE JUST ROARED BUT NO MOVEMENT.  ONCE OTHER DRIVERS WERE ALERTED I HAD TO COAST BACKWARDS FROM THE INCLINE AT THE LIGHT AND MANEUVER ONTO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  I TURNED THE TRUCK BACK ON AND IT CAME ON AND MIRACULOUSLY I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE IT 5FT OFF THE ROAD BEFORE IT STALLED AGAIN.  I HAD TO BE TOWED TO A DEALER AS OF TODAY I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE TRANSMISSION BUT THE DEALER HAD TO CONTACT GMC TO REPORT ALL MAJOR ENGINE FAILURE BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH ANY WORK.    LAST YEAR IN DEC. MY TRUCK STARTED MAKING WHINING NOISE AND I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT TO THE DEALER TO FIND OUT THAT THE CAMSHAFT HAD WENT BAD AND SPIT METAL IN MY MOTOR CAUSING ME TO HAVE THE ENGINE REPLACED.  BECAUSE I WAS THE SECOND OWNER OF THE VEHICLE GM DIDN'T WANT TO PAY FOR THE TOTAL BILL UNDER THE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY AND THE FACT THAT I WAS 3000 MILES OVER THE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY ITSELF.  THEY DID PAY A THIRD OF A $5000 BILL AND I HAD TO PAY THE REST ONLY TO HAVE THEM PLACE A RECALL ON THE CAMSHAFT AND TO REIMBURSE ME HALF OF WHAT I PAID.      THIS SITUATION WITH THE TRANSMISSION REMINDS ME OF THE ROLLOVER WITH THE FIRESTONE TIRE FORD HAD YEARS BACK BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT FORD AND FIRESTONE TOOK RESPONSIBILITY.

I SPENT 40,000.00 ON THIS CAR TO DRIVE IT LONGER THAN THIS AND FOR ALL THE THINGS TO START NICKEL AND DIMMING ME IS RIDICULOUS.

GM DIDN'T WANT TO RECALL THE 07-10 MODELS BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE AFFECTED MILLIONS OF CARS, SO THEY ARE JUST LETTING THE OWNERS SUFFER FOR THEIR STUPIDITY AND LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY.

I HAD MY HUSBAND DRIVE IT BACK UP TO THE SHOP TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT.  WHEN HE GOT INTO IT HE WAS UNABLE TO REVERSE IT; REVERSE JUST SIMPLY STOPPED WORKING.  HE HAD TO TURN AROUND IN OUR YARD - ON THE WAY TO THE SHOP (6 MILES AWAY) THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT GO OVER 30 MPH AND AGAIN SHUT OFF ON HIM WHILE TRYING TO TURN INTO THE AUTO SHOP.

HAVE DETAILED COLOR PHOTOS OF SOAKED WIRES, SATURATED HEADLINER, MOLD DAMAGE AND CORRODED FUSE BLOCK.
