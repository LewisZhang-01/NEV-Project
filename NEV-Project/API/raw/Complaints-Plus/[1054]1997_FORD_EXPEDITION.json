IT BEGAN WHEN I NOTICED SUDDEN AND VIOLENT VIBRATION COMING FROM THE FRONT DRIVER SIDE TIRE WHILE DRIVING AT 60MPH ON HIGHWAY 82 IN MONTANA. I IMMEDIATELY SLOWED DOWN, PULLED OVER AND INSPECTED THE TIRE TO FIND CHUNKS OF RUBBER FALLING OUT AND TREAD BULGING & WARPED. THIS TIRE (PROPER MOUNTED & BALANCED) HAS APPX 75% TREAD. I SLOWLY DROVE HOME AND PARKED THE VEHICLE. THE FOLLOWING DAY I WAS GOING TO REPLACE IT WITH THE SPARE. WHEN I WENT OUT THE NEXT MORNING THE TIRE HAD COMPLETELY GONE FLAT. A CLOSER LOOK REVEALED OVER NIGHT THE TIRE HAD EXPLODED WITH THE TREAD COMPLETELY SEPARATING FROM THE TIRE AROUND 1/5 OF ITS CIRCUMFERENCE. THE STEEL BELTS STILL ATTACHED TO THE LIFTED PART OF THE TREAD. I WAS LUCKY THIS DIDN'T EXPLODE WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY.. AS GOING 60MPH ON A TWO LANE HIGHWAY (ONE LANE EACH WAY) THAT IS HEAVILY USED BY LOGGING TRUCKS GOING 70+MPH COULD HAVE LEAD TO A DEVASTATING AND TRAGIC ACCIDENT. AN INCIDENT OF THIS NATURE ON ICY ROADS IN WINTER WOULD HAVE ONLY INCREASED THE LIKELY-HOOD OF A FATALITY. I'M NOT SURE IF THIS TIRE IS AN ISOLATED DEFECTIVE ITEM OR IF ALL THE 255/70 R16 AMERI-TRAC TIRES ARE BAD, BUT I CERTAINLY WANT THIS DEFECTIVE TIRE REPLACED BY GENERAL AS NO TIRE OF THIS POOR OF QUALITY SHOULD LEGALLY BE ON THE ROAD. IT WOULD BE LIKE ALLOWING BRAKE MANUFACTURERS TO SELL BRAKES SYSTEMS THAT ARE KNOWN TO FAIL OR ALLOWING STEERING WHEEL MANUFACTURERS TO SELL STEERING WHEELS THAT ARE KNOWN TO FALL OFF WHILE DRIVING.    IF HEAVY PENALTIES AND FINES WERE GIVEN TO THESE COMPANIES (THAT HAVE WEAK INSPECTION PROCEDURES) FOR EACH DEFECTIVE INCIDENT, MAYBE THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THESE TIRES TO BE SOLD...

I WAS TERRIFIED CAUSE THIS HAPPEN AS I WAS GOING BETWEEN 65 AND 70 MILES PER HOUR ON FREE WAY. ONCE I  COASTED SAFELY  TO SIDE OF FREEWAY AND EXAMINED UNDER MY HOOD I SEE MY SPARK PLUG WIRE LAYING TO THE SIDE AND SPARK PLUG LAYING ON AXLE I WAS IN DISBELIEF UNTIL   I TRIED TO PICK UP SPARK PLUG AND IT WAS TOO HOT, TO HOLD IN MY HAND  YES THIS WAS MY SPARK PLUG! IT HAD BEEN SPIT OUT OF THE ENGINE. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS ONCE THIS HAPPENS YOUR TRUCK LOSE POWER AND SLOWS DOWN TREMENDOUSLY, I HAD MY TRUCK TOWED TO SHOP. I KNEW I WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME EXPLAINING THIS TO MECHANIC, BECAUSE I'M A WOMAN AND MECHANIC WAS NOT GOING TO BELIEVE ME, BUT HE STATED THAT IT WAS COMMON IN FORD TRUCKS, THE SAME THING HAPPEN TO HIM AND WHEN HE CONTACTED DEALER THEY DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THEY'RE SPARK PLUGS. MY QUESTION IS DOES SOME HAVE TO BE KILLED BEFORE YOU GUYS DO SOMETHING IT COST ME $400 DOLLARS TO REPAIR THIS AND IT COULD HAVE COST ME MY LIFE MECHANIC STATED THAT IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN AND MAYBE I SHOULD GET RID OF IT AS HE SOLD HIS NAVIGATOR AFTER HIS INCIDENT.

AND I ASKED THEM WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF IT RAINS AFTER I PICK IT UP AND BEFORE IT GETS LOOKED AT.  THEY SAID I'D BE FINE IF IT'S WITHIN A FEW DAYS (\"JUST DON'T WAIT A MONTH\").  WELL I PICKED IT UPON THE EVENING, AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE NEXT DAY FOR WINDSHIELD.  IT RAINED OVERNIGHT, THOUGH I EVEN COVERED THE AREA AS BEST I COULD.

THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PART  IS THAT IS NOT SAFE . WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL IS TAKEN OFF OF THE SPLINED SHAFT  THE NEW PIECE IS PUT ON AND DOES NOT  EVEN HAVE A SPLINED CENTER TO FIT TIGHT ON THE SHAFT AND THE ONLY OTHER THING TO HOLD IT TIGHT IS 2 SET SCREWS. IF ONE OF THESE SET SCREWS WOULD WORK LOSE OR IF THE STEERING WHEEL  WERE TURNED TO HARD  THESE SET SCREWS  WOULD WORK LOOSE  AND THE  STEERING WHEEL WOULD TURN BUT THE WHEELS WOULDN'T , OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND . I HAVE  TALKED TO A AUTO REPAIR SPECIALIST ALONG WITH THE HEAD MECHANIC SUPERVISOR AT A FORD DEALERSHIP AND BOTH MEN SAID THAT THIS PART IS NOT VERY SAFE AND THEY WOULD NT WANT IT ON THEIR CAR OR TRUCK , I ALSO  TALKED TO THE PERSON WHO INSTALLED THIS PART  HE NO LONGER USES THIS ALUMINUM PART BECAUSE IT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH  FOR THIS KIND OF STRESS THAT A STEERING WHEEL GOES THROUGH .

NOTHING HAPPENED FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND THEN SMOKE CAME OUT OF THE RADIO.  THE SMOKE STARTED TO FILL THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT .  I WAS AFRAID THE DASHBOARD AREA WAS ABOUT TO CATCH FIRE.  I MANAGED TO FIND A EXIT TO GET OFF THE FREEWAY, STOPPED THE CAR AND GET MY FAMILY OUT.  I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION HOWEVER THE SMOKE WAS STILL COMING OUT OF THE RADIO.  THE SMOKE STOPPED ABOUT 1 OR 2 MINUTES LATER.  I CALLED BOWEN SCARFF FORD IN KENT AND WAS REFERRED TO SOUND ON WHEELS FOR RADIO REPAIR.  THE MANAGER AT SOUND ON WHEELS PULLED THE RADIO FROM THE DASH AND SHOWED ME THE WATER DAMAGE ON THE RADIO AND COXIAL ANTENNA WIRE LEADING FROM THE ANTENNA TO THE BACK OF THE RADIO.  WHEN THE WATER GOT INTO THE BACK OF THE RADIO A SHORT WAS CAUSED AND THE SMOKE STARTED.  I WAS TOLD THIS WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE 97 FORD EXPEDITION.  I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO BOWEN SCARFF FORD AND WAS INFORMED A TECH MEMO HAD BEEN PUT OUT TO FORD MECHANIC BUT NOTHING HAD BEEN SENT TO FORD OWNERS OF EXPEDITION.  WHAT I EXPERIENCE WAS A SAFETY ISSUE.

IN APRIL/MAY OF 2000, THE DRIVER SIDE REAR TIRE PEELED LIKE AN ONION AND DID EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE REAR PANEL OF THE TRUCK.  AT THAT TIME, THE AAA TOWING SERVICE SAID THAT THE STEMS AND LUG NUTS WERE STRIPPED.  WE TOOK THE CAR TO MANHATTAN BEACH FORD FOR REPAIR AND INVESTIGATION.
