The road was smooth, there were no potholes, and I didn\u2019t hit anything. I had to pull over to get off the road and out of traffic.  I was only able to pull about eight feet off the road onto the dirt to get out of moving traffic and when I got out to see what had happened.  I was shocked to see that my drivers\u2019s rear tire was completely flat and smoking. I was also shocked to see that the outer sidewall of the tire had 14 large bulges / bumps circling the entire 360 degrees of the tire\u2019s outer sidewall surface. Being in a very dangerous situation on the highway in heavy fast moving traffic I had a call to 911 emergency come to assist me and they changed the defective tire.  After the tire had been removed it turned out that the only visible condition seen was on the tires outer sidewall.  The inner sidewall looks perfectly fine, all the condition seems only concentrated on the outer tire sidewall\u2019s area.",

THEN, IN OCT 2020 TOYOTA ISSUED THE SAME RECALL RE: FUEL PUMP BUT I WASN'T NOTIFIED UNTIL JAN/FEB 2021 BY MAIL. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER IN FEB, THEY CALLED TOYOTA WHO SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PARTS FOR A REMEDY.  WE KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE FUEL PUMP BECAUSE IT WAS DISCLOSED RE: THE IMPELLARS & WHAT OCCURRED DURING THE MFG PHASE.  ANYHOW THE DEALER COULDN'T REPLACE IT AS I WAS GOING TO PAY OUT OF POCKET.  I'M VERY IRRITATED BECAUSE I BOUGHT AN UNRELIABLE VEHICLE & CAN'T MAKE A LONG DISTANCE ROAD TRIP FEARING THE FUEL PUMP WILL FAIL.  I'M STILL WAITING FOR A REMEDY WHICH IS A NEW FUEL PUMP.  IT'S OBVIOUS TOYOTA DOESN'T CARE FOR PEOPLE PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT RISK DRIVING AROUND WITH A BAD FUEL PUMP.  THIS NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED ONCE & FOR ALL.  THEY NEED TO BEEF UP THE RE-MFG OF THE FUEL PUMP & TAKE CARE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS LIKE ME THAT SPENT 44,000 ON A CRUDDY VEHICLE.  I'M READY TO GET RID OF IT. PLEASE HELP.",

I AM NO VEHICLE ENGINEER, BUT IF THE FUEL PUMP IS THE ISSUE, AND THEY HAVE ISOLATED TO A FAULTY BATCH OF FUEL PUMPS, IT SEEMS THAT THE 'REMEDY' WOULD BE REPLACING THE FUEL PUMP.

INSTEAD, THEY ARE EITHER PUTTING THEIR CUSTOMERS AT RISK IN A CAR THAT THEY HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED CAN HAVE A RANDOM FUEL PUMP FAILURE LEADING TO BODILY HARM OR INJURY, OR THEY FORCE THEIR CUSTOMERS INTO A SUBPAR LOANER/RENTAL CAR (I INITIALLY WENT FROM A 4RUNNER TO A MINIVAN) AND HAVING TO RETURN TO THE RENTAL CAR COMPANY TO SIGN A NEW CONTRACT EVERY 30 DAYS.",
