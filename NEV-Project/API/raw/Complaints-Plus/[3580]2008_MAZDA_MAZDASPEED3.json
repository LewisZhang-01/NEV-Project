MY WIFE WAS DRIVING HER MAZDA SPEED3 AT HIGHWAY SPEED WHEN THE MOTOR FAILED WITHOUT WARNING AND CAUSED AN ENGINE COMPARTMENT FIRE.    THIS EVENT HAPPENED ONE TIME, CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE CAR THE APPROACHES ITS TOTAL LOSS VALUE.    A MAZDA DEALER HAS INSPECTED THE CAR AND FOUND THAT THE MOTOR FAILED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT OIL LEVEL; HOWEVER, AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT THE OIL HAD FALLEN TO LOW LEVEL.  THE DASH LOW OIL PRESSURE INDICATOR LIGHT DID NOT COME ON UNTIL AFTER THE MOTOR STOPPED RUNNING.      MAZDA HAS DENIED WARRANTY COVERAGE, SAYING THAT THE FAULT IS DUE TO THE MAZDA DEALER THAT PERFORMED THE LAST OIL CHANGE SERVICE DID NOT INSTALL THE OIL DRAIN PLUG PROPERLY.      THE CAR HAS NOT BEEN REPAIRED AND IS AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION.    THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL STOPPED TO PROVIDE ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE. *TR",

MAZDA SAYS THE VEHICLE WAS OVER DRIVEN AND THIS IS WHY THE MOUNT FAILED. THEY WILL NOT WARRANTY THE DAMAGES AND REPAIRS. THE VEHICLE IS LESS THAN THREE MONTHS OLD. THE DAY AFTER THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED THERE WAS A NOISE COMING FROM THE VEHICLE THAT WAS ABNORMAL. THERE WAS AN APPOINTMENT SCHEDULED WITH THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THIS LOOKED AT. THE MOTOR MOUNT FAILED BEFORE THIS APPOINTMENT. THIS COULD BE RELATED TO THE FAILURE. I DON'T FEEL THAT PICTURES CAN DETERMINE THAT IT WAS NOT A DEFECT. ALSO, PEOPLE DROVE THE CAR BEFORE I DID AND THAT COULD CAUSE THE BELIEF OF BEING OVER DRIVEN. TEST DRIVES WITH CUSTOMERS WOULD BE WHAT I'M REFERRING TO. ALSO, WE DON'T KNOW HOW HARD THE SALES PEOPLE DROVE THE CAR EITHER. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN REPORTS OF THIS SAME ISSUE HAPPENING TO OTHER PEOPLE. SOME OF THOSE WERE WARRANTED.  *TR",
