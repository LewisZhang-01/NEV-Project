THE NEXT MORNING ON THE WAY TO WORK IT DIED AGAIN AT THE SAME SPOT ON THE OFF RAMP. I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED AND MISSED A DAY OF WORK BECAUSE OF IT. I BROUGHT IT INTO THE SHOP AND MECHANIC SAID THE ALTERNATOR BELT WAS LOOSE AND HE FIXED IT. HOWEVER ITS HAPPENED SINCE NUMEROUS TIMES WHEN I TURN THE CAR OFF AND TRY TO START IT AGAIN THE CAR WONT START AT ALL FOR 20 MINUTES TO A COUPLE HOURS. NOW RECENTLY IT WILL SHUT OFF AS I'M DRIVING AND STEERING WHEEL IS VERY HARD TO TURN. IT IS GETTING MORE AND MORE FREQUENT AND IS EFFECTING WORK. KIA DEALERSHIPS REFUSE TO FIX IT AT COST EVEN THOUGH IT SEEMS LIKE A BIG PROBLEM THAT MANY KIA CUSTOMERS HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH.

THE NEXT DAY OCT.10, 2015 I WENT TO TRY AND TAKE MY TRUCK DOWN TO THE SHOP AND COULD START IT. IT WOULD TURN OVER BUT WOULD NOT START, SO THEY HAD TO COME AND TOW IT AWAY.

LAST NIGHT, 02/16/2015, THE VEHICLE DID THE SAME THING AGAIN AND AGAIN WE HAD TO RE-SET THE FUEL CUT OFF SWITCH AND THE ENGINE LIGHT REMAINED ON.  TODAY, 02/17/2015, WE RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE IT DIAGNOSED AND THEY DETERMINED THAT THE CAMSHAFT POSITIONING SENSORS AND THE CRANK SHAFT POSITIONING SENSOR NEED TO BE REPLACED AND NOW THEY WANT TO CHARGE ME ANOTHER $1,100. I HAVE GONE ONLINE AND DONE SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND SEVERAL OTHER COMPLAINTS SIMILAR TO MINE. I ALSO NOTED THAT THERE WAS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IN NJ FOR THE SAME THING. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT KIA MOTORS IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND JUST TURNING A BLIND EYE. THESE PROBLEMS CONTINUE AFTER REPAIRS ARE MADE ACCORDING TO THE COMPLAINTS I FOUND.  *TR",

IT IS 8 YEARS OLD WITH 108,000 MILES.   THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TURNED ON, I HEARD LOUD BANGING IN THE HOOD, THEN SUDDENLY IT TURNED OFF WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON CITY STREETS.  TRAFFIC WAS SLOW MOVING.  I HAD IT TOWED TO AN EXPERT MECHANIC AND OWNER OF HIS OWN SHOP.  MY MECHANIC HAS DONE SOME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE IN THE PAST AND CONSIDERED IT TO BE IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.  HE TOOK THE ENGINE APART AND FOUND PIECES BROKEN OFF FROM THE \"INTAKE RUNNER BUTTERFLY VALVE ASSEMBLY & FELL INTO THE ENGINE; ALSO THERE WAS A BUSHING FAILURE IN THE LOWER INDUCTION MANIFOLD.   MY 3.5 ENGINE WAS TOTALED WITHIN MINUTES ALONG WITH ALL SURROUNDING PARTS.  THE SAME ENGINE AS IN THE RECALL.   MY KIA HAS A 3.5 ENGINE, SAME AS IN THE RECALL BULLETIN #TT2008020601.  THE RECALL BULLETIN WAS FOR KIA MODELS 2003-2005, YET THIS EXACT INCIDENT WAS DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL BULLETIN.  I HAVE TWO PHOTOS OF SOME OF THE DAMAGE (1ST PHOTO IS THE INTAKE RUNNER ASSEMBLY W/TWO BROKEN MISSING BUTTERFLIES FOR CYLINDERS 5 & 6 & THE 2ND PHOTO OF A PIECE OF THE BUTTERFLY STUCK IN THE INTAKE PORT OF THE CYLINDER HEAD -BOTH TAKEN ON 9-12-2014.)  I THEN HAD IT TOWED TO A GARDEN GROVE KIA DEALERSHIP.  THEY INSPECTED & GAVE ME AN ESTIMATE OF $11,700.  ALL THEY SAID IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THAT 2006 MODELS WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL.  HOW CAN KIA CORPORATION GUARANTEE THAT THE SAME INFERIOR PARTS WERE NOT INSTALLED IN MY 2006 SORENTO?  IT WAS MANUFACTURED IN 2005.  KIA CORPORATION SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DAMAGE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS NOT COMPLETELY RESOLVED WITH THE 2005 MODELS.   *TR",

I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL MECHANIC WHO INFORMED ME THAT THE HARMONIC BALANCER HAD FALLEN OFF DUE TO THE CRANKSHAFT BOLT SHEARING OFF. ONCE IT WAS FIXED BY AN ASE CERTIFIED MECHANIC, APPROXIMATELY 8000 MILES LATER I WAS DRIVING TO WORK AND THE CAR STARTED SHAKING LIKE I WAS DRIVING ON RUMBLE STRIPS. I TOOK IT BACK TO A SERVICE GARAGE AND AFTER REPLACING THE HARMONIC BALANCER AND CRANKBOLT AGAIN THEY CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE CRANKSHAFT WAS BENT. THE GARAGE SUGGESTED REPLACING THE ENTIRE CRANKSHAFT AND BALANCER AND THEN HAVING THE ENGINE REBALANCED OR A COMPLETE ENGINE REPLACEMENT BOTH OF WHICH ARE GREATER THAN $3500 TO REPAIR ON A VEHICLE THAT'S WORTH ABOUT $5500..IT'S BEEN APPROXIMATELY $2000 THAT I'VE ALREADY SPENT TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM AND THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS. IT'S AT A LOCAL KIA DEALERSHIP NOW, WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND THEY TOLD ME THAT IT'S NOT FIXABLE AND THEY CAN ONLY RECOMMEND TO REPLACE THE ENGINE WHICH WOULD COST $6,700 FOR A USED ENGINE WITH 71,000 MILES ON IT. IT SEEMS THAT THIS SAME ISSUE HAPPENS ON THESE MOTORS BETWEEN 60K AND 90K MILES THEN FROM DOING SOME RESEARCH, IT SEEMS AFTER REPAIRS ARE DONE THE SAME PROBLEM HAPPENS APPROXIMATELY 6K-10K MILES LATER. AFTER LOOKING INTO IT, IT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM WOULD BE MANUFACTURER DEFECTS AND FAULTY PARTS. THIS HAS CAUSED ME TO BE OUT OF A VEHICLE SINCE MID NOVEMBER OF 2012. IT'S DISTURBING WITH HOW MANY OTHER COMPLAINTS I'M READING ON THIS SITE ABOUT THE SAME EXACT THING!  *TR",

THERE IS NO RECORD OF OUR CALLS NOR IS THERE ANY RECORD OF THE \"CODES\". I HAVE INITIATED A COMPLAINT WITH THE PARENT COMPANY, TO NO AVAIL. AFTER REVIEWING SOME OF THE LITERATURE I HAVE NOTED THAT KIA HAS HAD ISSUES SIMILAR TO THIS SINCE 1999 WITH A NHTSA INVESTIGATION OF GAS TANK LEAKS IN MAY 2006.
