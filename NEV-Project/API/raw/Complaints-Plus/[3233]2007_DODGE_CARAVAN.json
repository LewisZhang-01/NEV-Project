I PURCHASED A LIFETIME ALIGNMENT AND ROTATED THE TIRES AT B/F.  AFTER ANOTHER 1300 MILES, THE PULL WAS A HARDER RIGHT.   F/B CHECKED THE ALIGNMENT, STATING IT WAS GOOD AND TOLD ME THIS WAS A \"BELT\" ISSUE....PUT THE \"BAD\" TIRES TO THE REAR AND ORDERED TWO OEM TIRES.  I AM AWAITING 2 NEW TIRES OF THE SAME OEM (ONE TO BE WARRANTED THE OTHER SELF PAY).      THE F/B STORE, WHERE I PURCHASED THE LIFETIME ALIGNMENT, TELLS ME YOU CAN CHECK A BELT PROBLEM BY CROSS ROTATING THE TIRES.  UNTIL THAT TEST IS COMPLETED, THEY CANNOT CONSIDER REPLACING A DAMAGED TIRE UNDER THE WARRANTY.        BOTH TIRES ARE UNDER THE 12 MONTH-2/32 DEPTH WARRANTY PROVIDED WITH MY NEW CAR.  I THINK F/B SHOULD COVER THE WARRANTY ON BOTH DAMAGED TIRES WITHOUT ANY NEED TO TEST FOR A BELT ISSUE.  EITHER THE ?BAD? BELT DAMAGED 2 TIRES OR AN IMPROPER ALIGNMENT DAMAGED 2 TIRES.  AFTER READING NUMEROUS REVIEWS ABT THIS PARTICULAR TIRE ON WWW.NHTSA AND WWW.TIRERACK.COM, I DO NOT WANT TO PAY A DIME FOR A TURANZA EL42 REPLACEMENT TIRE.  REVIEWS OF THESE TIRES ON BMW'S, ACURA'S, AND DODGE/CHRYSLER PRODUCTS SHOW NUMEROUS PROBLEMS FROM BLOW-OUTS, POOR TREAD WEAR, FLAT SPOTS, CUPPING, AND BELT ISSUES.      ADDENDUM: WHILE THE ORIGINAL F/B STORE (WHO INITIALLY ALIGNED AND ROTATED MY TIRES) WILL NOT CONSIDER HONORING THE TIRE WARRANTY, I DID FIND ANOTHER F/B STORE IN MY AREA (20 MILES AWAY INSTEAD OF JUST 4 MILES AWAY) WHO WILL REPLACE THE 2 WORN TIRES WITHOUT QUESTION AND UNDER THE WARRANTY.  I WILL SPEAK WITH THE DISTRICT MANAGER OF F/B ABOUT BOTH LOCAL STORES AND THE GOOD AND BAD BEHAVIORS OF EACH STORE MANAGER.  *TR",

IN MY INSTANCE, WE JUST BOUGHT THIS VAN LESS THAN A MONTH AGO AND MY KNEES BUMPED THE KEYS THAT WERE ATTACHED TO THE KEY IN THE IGNTION. SUBSEQUENTLY THE CAR TURNED OFF LEAVING ME WITH NO BRAKES & STEERING. THIS OCCURRED TWICE JUST A COUPLE DAYS AFTER PURCHASING IT AND IT HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP EVER SINCE.  LUCKILY WHEN THIS OCCURRED, THE VEHICLE WAS IN A PARK POSITION. SAME PROBLEM WAS ALSO NOTICED BY THE TECH CREW AT THE DEALERSHIP ON MY VEHICLE AND ALL THE OTHER 2007 CARAVANS AT THE DEALERSHIP.  DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE IGNITION IN MY VEHICLE TWICE AS WELL AS TRIED MANUALLY TIGHTENING THE IGNITION CYLINDER WITH NO SUCCESS. DEALERSHIP SAID THEY HAVE NO OTHER RECOURSE BECAUSE CHRYSLER ENGINEERING DEPT. IS VOWING THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE PARTS AND THAT IT WORKS AS EXPECTED.   I HAVE GONE THROUGH THE VARIOUS CHANNELS IN THE CHRYSLER \"BUYBACK\" PROGRAM AND ULTIMATELY SPOKE WITH THE DISTRICT MANAGER WHO STATED THEY DO NOT SEE ANY ISSUES AND NO ONE ELSE HAS COMPLAINED SO THEY WILL NOT BUY BACK THE VEHICLE.  THE SUGGESTIONS I HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE CHRYSLER STAFF SAID I SHOULD ADJUST MY SEAT, REMOVE EXTRA KEYS FROM THE ONE IN THE IGNITION AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK PURCHASE ANOTHER VEHICLE FOR THIS IS NOT THEIR PROBLEM.  NORMALLY I LIKE CARAVANS FOR I HAVE OWNED ANOTHER ONE FOR 10 YEARS AND THE IGNITION ON MY OLD VAN IS NOTHING LIKE THIS ONE.  ULTIMATELY I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF FIX PUT IN PLACE FOR I DON'T THINK THE KEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO SPIN THAT FREELY.
