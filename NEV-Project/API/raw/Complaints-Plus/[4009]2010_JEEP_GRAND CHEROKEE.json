I PURCHASED MY NICE WELL MAINTAINED JEEP IN FEBRUARY 2018.  I JUST REACHED 82,000 MILES AND ON MONDAY SEPTEMBER 2 2019 I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY AROUND 60-70MPH WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN I HEARD A VERY SUBTLE NOISE AND I LOOKED AT MY DASH TO SEE A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND ANOTHER LIGHT. AT THAT POINT I HAD NO POWER AND I SHIFTED INTO NEUTRAL.  I TRIED RESTARTING AND COULD HEAR THE STARTER TURNING OVER BUT IT DIDN'T START BACK UP.  ONCE I GOT TO A SAFE PLACE I TRIED AGAIN AND STILL NOTHING.  IT WAS TURNING OVER WITH NO BAD SOUNDS AND SEEMED LIKE IT WAS TURNING OVER EASILY.  I HAD THE JEEP TOWED TO A MECHANIC WHERE THEY FOUND 4 CYLINDERS HAD NO COMPRESSION. THEY REMOVED THE HEADS TO FIND SOME VALVES WERE VISIBLY BENT.  WHEN THEY TRIED TURNING THE CRANK BY HAND THEY FOUND THE CAM WAS NOT MOVING.  UPON OPENING THE FRONT COVER THE TIMING CHAIN HAD ACTUALLY FAILED AND WAS BROKEN.  I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED TO SAY THE LEAST.  I WAS HOPING TO HAVE A NICE CAR FOR A WHILE AND THIS JEEP WAS IN VERY GOOD SHAPE.  I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING AND FOUND THERE HAS BEEN A RECALL FOR THE SAME ENGINE IN OTHER MOPAR VEHICLES AND WAS HOPING TO GET SOME INSIGHT IF MY JEEP LIKE OTHERS I HAVE READ ABOUT WOULD BE ABLE TO GO UNDER THAT RECALL FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.  I THINK ITS SOMETHING WITH THE TENSIONER ON THE RECALL THAT ENDS UP WIPING OUT THE TIMING CHAIN.  I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY THEY ONLY PUT LIKE 3 VEHICLES IN THE RECALL BUT IF ITS THE SAME ENGINE WHY NOT FIX THEM ALL.  I REALLY LIKE MY JEEP AND HOPE TO GET MORE INFO OF THE RECALL.

AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A GLITCH BUT AFTER IT KEPT OCCURRING, I FINALLY TOOK IT TO BE LOOKED AT IN FEBRUARY 2014.  I WAS TOLD THAT I NEED A TRANSFER CASE ACTUATOR AND THAT THEY WERE ON BACK ORDER.  FOR THE NEXT 3 MONTHS, I CHECKED IN WITH THE DEALER EVERY OTHER WEEK ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT THERE WAS STILL NO UPDATE ON THE PART AND THEY WERE STILL ON BACK ORDER.  NOT ONCE WAS I EVER TOLD THAT THIS ISSUE IS LIKELY RELATED TO THE N23 RECALL.  DURING THE LAST CALL, I WAS TOLD THAT CHRYSLER HAD ROLLED OUT A NEW SOFTWARE FIX AND THAT I NEED TO BRING IN MY JEEP (I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THE ACTUATOR ORDER HAD BEEN CANCELLED PER CHRYSLER DIRECTION).  I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING A THREAD ON A JEEP USER FORUM THAT HAS CLEARLY LAID OUT THIS ISSUE AND THE FACT THAT THERE IS SILL NO KNOWN FIX, ONLY AN APPARENT COVER UP BY CHRYSLER AND ALL PARTIES INVOLVED.  IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS SINCE I FIRST FORMALLY WENT IN TO HAVE THIS LOOKED AT, NO ONE HAS CALLED ME OR MADE AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE IT.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.  I HAVE PAID A LOT OF MONEY AND PUT IN A LOT OF TIME WITH THIS VEHICLE ONLY TO HAVE KEY FEATURES NOT WORK.  THIS IN ITSELF IS A SAFETY HAZARD.  IF I WERE TO GET STUCK AND NEED 4W-LOW AND WASN'T AWARE THAT IT WASN'T AVAILABLE, WE WOULD HAVE BIGGER PROBLEMS.  I'M CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO TAKE IT IN AGAIN ON 5/31/14 TO HAVE THE \"NEW FIX\" APPLIED AND I HAVE LOW EXPECTATIONS.  CHRYSLER NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND START ROLLING OUT NEW PARTS THAT AREN'T FLASHED WITH THE N23 AND THEN DEVELOP A NEW N23 THAT DOESN'T AFFECT THE 4W-LOW SETTING.  *TR",

WINDOWS AND THE SUNROOF WERE ALL CLOSED AND THE AIR CONDITIONER WAS SET TO 25 DEGREES CELSIUS AND THE INTERIOR AIR CIRCULATION MODE WAS SELECTED. CABIN AIR WAS QUITE WARM.

ON 12/19/2009 WHILE TRAVELING ON BAILEY RD IN KENT COUNTY, MI THE ESP CAUSED THE LOST OF CONTROL OF OUR 2008 JEEP LIBERTY ON WET ICY ROADS.

IN EARLY MAY, 2010 I WAS INVOLVED IN AN AVOIDABLE ACCIDENT WITH MY 2008 LIBERTY WHEN THE ESP PREVENTED ME FROM SWERVING TO AVOID ANOTHER CAR STOPPED AT A GREEN LIGHT.

ANY IDIOT WITH ANY DRIVING EXPERIENCE KNOWS BETTER THAN TO SLAM ON THE BRAKES ON WET ICY ROADS.

THE ONLY WAY TO CORRECT THIS WAS TO PULL OVER AND RESTART THE CAR.  I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP, BUT WAS TOLD THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT UNLESS THE ISSUE WAS OCCURRING WHILE IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  SINCE THIS ISSUE COULD POTENTIALLY CREATE INJURY TO ME AND CARS BEHIND ME, I CONTINUED TO ALERT THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT ON EACH EVENT.  THEY ASKED ME TO KEEP A LOG OF WHEN IT WOULD HAPPEN, BUT AFTER DOING THAT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, THERE APPEARED TO BE NO PATTERN.  IT COULD HAPPEN ANY TIME, UNDER ANY WEATHER CONDITIONS, AT ANY SPEED, NO MATTER IF I WAS DRIVING 10 MINUTES OR 1 HOUR.  THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED MY CAR CLOSED A COUPLE OF MONTHS AFTER MY PURCHASE, SO I BROUGHT THE CAR TO ANOTHER JEEP DEALER THAT KEPT IT FOR OVER A WEEK, AND MADE SOME CORRECTIONS OF WHAT THEY THOUGHT MIGHT BE CAUSING THE PROBLEM.  I WAS LULLED INTO A FALSE SECURITY BECAUSE AFTER A FEW THOUSAND MILES, IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  NOW, I CAN GO SEVERAL THOUSAND MILES, THEN OUT OF THE BLUE, JUST WHEN I THINK I'M SAFE, IT HAPPENS AGAIN.  THEY CAN'T SEEM TO ISOLATE THE PROBLEM TO DO A REPAIR THAT WILL LAST.  THE VEHICLES BEHIND ME DON'T KNOW MY CAR IS COASTING...THIS COULD CAUSE A REAR END COLLISION.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS IF I'M ON A HIGHWAY.  I MAY HAVE TO CROSS SEVERAL LANES OF SPEEDING TRAFFIC TO GET TO THE SHOULDER TO RESTART THE CAR.  WHEN I TAKE THE CAR IN, THEY DO A DIAGNOSTIC, BUT RESTARTING THE CAR RESETS THE DEFAULTS TO NORMAL.  NOTHING EVER SHOWS UP.  VERY DANGEROUS!!!!  *TR",
