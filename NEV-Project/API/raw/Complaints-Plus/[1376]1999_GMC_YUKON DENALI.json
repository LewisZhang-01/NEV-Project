I HAD TO PUSH THE PEDAL TO THE FLOOR REPEATEDLY TO STOP, BARELY MISSED HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. I WAS ON ONE OF MY CITY STREETS GETTING BACK HOME AFTER GROCERY SHOPPING. DROVE HOME SLOWLY AND VERY CAREFULLY.  HAD IT TOWED TO A NEARBY GM DEALER.  HE SAYS MOST OF THE BRAKE LINES AND SOME HOSES HAVE RUSTED, NEED TO BE REPLACED. THAT WOULD BE 15-16 HOURS LABOR AND WILL COST ME $ 2000.00.  IT SNOWS HERE QUITE A BIT AND AFTER THE SEASON, I ALWAYS WASH MY VEHICLES WITH EMPHASIS ON THE UNDERSIDE TO REMOVE THE SALT AND CHEMICALS. BESIDES, ON THIS VEHICLE I HAD TO REPAINT THE HOOD TWICE, ROOF ONCE AND REPLACE THE REAR BUMPER SO FAR- ALL DUE TO RUST.  NOW MY FRONT BUMPER IS SHOWING SIGNS OF RUST.  WHAT'S THE MATTER - WITH ALL THIS EXCESSIVE RUSTING ON THIS VEHICLE.  I HAVE MY OTHER SUV PARKED RIGHT BESIDE THIS AT HOME AND USE IT IN THE WINTER TIME.  IT IS MUCH OLDER THAN YUKON AND THERE IS NO RUST PROBLEM AT ALL WITH IT. LOOKS LIKE THERE IS SOME SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THE METAL USED IN THIS VEHICLE  OR LACK OF QUALITY CONTROL.  GM DID A BAD JOB WITH THIS VEHICLE. THEY SAY THERE WAS NO RECALL ON THIS MODEL.  WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF I CAN GET COMPENSATED  BY GM FOR ALL THIS HARDSHIP. DO NOT KNOW WHAT ELSE IS IN STORE WITH THIS VEHICLE IN FUTURE.   HAVE TO GET THE BRAKE JOB DONE  RIGHT AWAY BUT VERY PRICEY FOR MY BUDGET.  PLEASE CHECK INTO THIS PROBLEM AND LET ME KNOW HOW TO PROCEED.  LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU SOON.
