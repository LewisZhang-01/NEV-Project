At that point, the \"Service Brake Assist\" message was displayed in the center of the instrument cluster.  I cleared the message to let the vehicle move.  Every time that I depressed the brake pedal, the same thing would happen -- grinding similar to what would be heard and felt when the ABS being activated (in between each instance, I would clear the message from the screen).  It did not matter if I was going 2 mph or 20 mph, going forward or backwards.  I drove up to 25 mph and this also resulted in diminished brake performance - which could put others at risk.  In this regard, I do have two videos of the incident.  When I shut the car off and opened the driver's door, the Suburban reset and the brake assist system operated normally for the rest of the quarter-mile drive back to its parking spot as though nothing had happened.    The vehicle is currently at the dealer for repair.  It is important to note that this same issue occurred approximately one year ago and the dealership advised that they had replaced the brake booster sensor at that time.

FOLLOWING A BATHROOM BREAK AT A REST STOP, WE LOADED UP IN THE CAR, STARTED IT VIA THE PUSH IGNITION AND DROVE DOWN THE ON RAMP ONTO THE HIGHWAY.  WITHIN SECONDS, SMOKE BEGAN BILLOWING FROM THE HOOD.  A FIRE UNDER THE HOOD ENSUED.  WE WERE TRAVELING AT APPROXIMATELY 30-40MPH, WHEN THE SMOKE BECAME SUDDENLY HEAVY.  WE PULLED OVER AND PARKED THE CAR ON THE SHOULDER AND ATTEMPTED TO TURN IT OFF.  FOR 30-40 SECONDS, THE CAR WOULD NOT TURN OFF, RATHER, IT SHOOK AND SPUTTERED.  WE EVACUATED THE CAR AND CALLED THE STATE POLICE WHO ARRIVED SHORTLY THEREAFTER.  THE SUBURBAN WAS TOWED TO RICK HENDRICK CHEVROLET IN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA.  ABOUT A WEEK LATER, WE WERE TOLD THAT THE PUSH IGNITION IN THE CAR CAUSED AN ELECTRICAL FIRE.  CHEVROLET STILL HAS THE CAR AND IS WORKING TO REPAIR, BUT WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT TAKING POSSESSION OF A 4 WEEK OLD CAR THAT CAUGHT FIRE.  WOULD APPRECIATE CHEVROLET'S ASSISTANCE, BUT THE DEALERSHIP THAT WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE, KOONS CHEVROLET OF MCLEAN, HAS BEEN NONRESPONSIVE AND VERY UNHELPFUL.",
