THE POTENTIAL FOR FIRE OR EXPLOSION IS RATHER PRONOUNCED BECAUSE OF WHERE IT SITS. IF HONDA IS GOING TO USE PLASTIC IN ITS FUEL DELIVERY SYSTEM THEN LET THEM MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T LEAK YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. I HAVE READ ABOUT THIS ON THE INTERNET FROM OTHER 2002 CIVIC OWNERS. MY CIVIC IS NOT AN SI BUT IT WAS THE ONLY 02 CIVIC LISTED ON YOUR SITE . WE HAD THE PUMP PUMP ASSEMBLY REPLACED. IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT THIS ISSUE COULD LEAD TO TERRIBLE ACCIDENTS TO OTHER OWNERS",
