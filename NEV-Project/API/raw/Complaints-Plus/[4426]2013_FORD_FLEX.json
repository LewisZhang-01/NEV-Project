The above issues lead to several safety concerns including:  - the interior lights being on makes it difficult to see while driving at night,  - the interior being illuminated after the vehicle is parked and locked creates a security exposure,  - the child safety lock features do not function as intended as the doors cannot lock while the vehicle is in motion,  - the alarm system repeatedly triggering is annoying as there is no way to turn off the alarm system.  That is, if the car is locked, then the system is armed and will trigger in time. The rear passenger-side door had this same issue a few years ago.

WHILE DRIVING THE INTERCHANGE FROM THE SOUTHBOUND 55 FWY TO THE NORTHBOUND 405 FWY (IN COSTA MESA, CA) AT A SPEED OF 60 MPH MY 2013 FORD FLEX SEL BEGAN FISHTAILING ERRATICALLY ' SWERVING AND JERKING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN LANES. AFTER A FRIGHTENING 10-20 SECONDS, I WAS ABLE TO MANEUVER THE CAR TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER OF THE INTERCHANGE WITHOUT ROLLING THE CAR OR HITTING ANYTHING OR ANYONE. (AT THE TIME THERE WAS AN AVERAGE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC ON THE ROAD ALL GOING ABOUT 50-60 MPH AND WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE SUNNY, 65). MY INITIAL STOPPING POINT WAS NOT IN A SAFE LOCATION SO WHEN I PROCEEDED TO GO FORWARD ABOUT 300 FEET TO A SLIGHTLY SAFER LOCATION, I COULD AGAIN FEEL THE CAR START TO FISHTAIL WHILE GOING ONLY 5-10 MPH AND MY STEERING WHEEL WAS COMPLETELY OFF BALANCE AND NOT CENTERED.    I INSPECTED THE CAR AND COULD SEE NO VISIBLE PROBLEM BESIDES MY STEERING WHEEL BEING OFF CENTER. THE CAR WAS TOWED VIA FLAT BED TOW TRUCK 13 MILES TO VILLA FORD IN ORANGE, CA WHERE IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DETERMINED TO BE A FAILED TOE LINK SUSPENSION ASSOCIATED WITH FORD RECALL 20S04.     I WANTED TO REPORT MY EXPERIENCE AND REITERATE THAT THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE!!

I URGE YOU TO START PUSHING FORD TO TAKE THIS RECALL MORE SERIOUSLY!! I NEVER RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE AND ONLY LEARNED OF THIS ISSUE AFTER GOOGLING TO SEE IF ANY OTHERS HAVE HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE BECAUSE IT HAD SCARED ME SO MUCH.

HOWEVER, A WEEK EXACTLY LATER I ATTEMPTED TO START MY VEHICLE WHEN THE EXACT SCENARIO HAPPENED ALL OVER AGAIN.  VEHICLE WOULD NOT START, BUT LIGHTS AND RADIO WORKED.  LEFT ALONE OVERNIGHT I WENT TO START IT THIS MORNING AND IT STARTS.         THROUGH OUT THE DURATION OF THIS ISSUE OF STALLING, NOT STARTING, PULLING WHILE IN MOTION AS IT FEELS LIKE THE VEHICLE IS BEING JERKED THERE IS NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT OR WHEN CHECKING SYSTEM THE ONLY WARNING IS PASSENGER SEAT AJAR.",

WHEN THIS PROBLEM BEGAN, OPENING AND CLOSING THE DOOR WOULD BE ENOUGH TO ENGAGE THE SENSOR BUT OVER THE PAST MONTH IT HAS NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE. THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR A FEW REASONS: FIRST, IT DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY LOCK THE DOORS WHEN THE CAR IS IN MOTION WHICH IS A POTENTIAL SAFETY HAZARD UNDER NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS OR IF THE VEHICLE WAS TO BE IN AN ACCIDENT. THE DOOR COULD POSSIBLY FLY OPEN DURING A COLLISION LEAVING THE PASSENGERS VULNERABLE TO BEING THROWN FROM THE VEHICLE OR OBJECTS COMING INTO THE VEHICLE. SECOND, THE CABIN LIGHT REMAINS ON WHILE DRIVING WHICH CREATES A GLARE ON THE WINDSHIELD MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE. THIRD, THE CABIN LIGHTS STAY ON AFTER THE VEHICLE IS LOCKED WHICH CAUSES AN UNWARRANTED STRAIN ON THE VEHICLE BATTERY. AS FOR THE BACK RIGHT PASSENGER DOOR, IT IS NOT LATCHING.

THIS DOOR AJAR SENSOR KEEPS LIGHTS ILLUMINATED DRAINING THE BATTERY, EVEN THOUGH THE DOOR IS SHUT. THIS KEEPS THE LIGHTS ON WHEN DRIVING, AND AT NIGHT MAKES IT VERY VERY HARD TO SEE AND DRIVE. THIS WILL CAUSE AN ACCIDENT DUE TO FAULTY DOOR SENSORS.",

A POWER STEERING FAILURE MESSAGE APPEARED ON THE DASH BOARD AS THIS WAS HAPPENING. THE CAR HAS ONLY 55,000 MILES. AFTER RETRIEVING THE VEHICLE, I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA FORD. I DID SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AND FOUND A RECALL #15V340000 WAS FOR THIS EXACT POWER STEERING PROBLEM FOR 2011, 2012 AND SOME 2013 FORD FLEXES. AFTER RUNNING TESTS AT RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA FORD- A DIAGNOSIS OF DTC U3000:49 WAS FOUND SAYING POWER STEERING INTERNAL FAILURE. AFTER INITIALLY BEING LED TO BELIEVE (BY RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA FORD) THAT FORD WAS HONORING IT UNDER THE RECALL, TO MY SURPRISE FORD HAS DECLINED MY 2013 FORD FLEX SAYING IT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE INITIAL RECALL(NUMBER ABOVE. THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY AND LIABILITY ISSUE.  I COULD HAVE DRIVEN OFF A CLIFF WITH MY 3 KIDS IF IT FAILED AT THE WRONG MOMENT OR HIT OTHER CARS AND CAUSED SOMEONE ELSE HARM OR EVEN DEATH. THE POWER STEERING FAILED COMPLETELY WITHOUT NOTICE. I WAS UNABLE TO MANEUVER THE STEERING WHEEL AT ALL.  I THINK OTHER OWNERS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND HAVE IT TAKEN CARE OF BY FORD SO THEY ARE NOT AT RISK OR IN DANGER. FORD SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING THEIR CUSTOMERS AND REPLACING ALL DEFECTIVE POWER STEERING ISSUES. I HAVE ATTACHED PART OF THE INVOICE FOR YOU TO SEE THE DIAGNOSIS CODE. I OPTED TO NOT GIVE THEM ANOTHER $2,000 TO FIX THEIR DEFECTIVE ISSUE AND HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE IT ELSEWHERE. SO THAT IS WHY IT SAYS DECLINED REPAIRS FOR THAT SECTION.

I HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH ALL DOORS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MY LEFT BACK DOOR.  I HAVE HAD THIS ISSUE LOOKED AT MULTIPLE TIMES AT THE FORD DEALERSHIP WITH MOST RECENTLY THIS PAST WEEKEND.  THE MECHANIC ATTEMPTED TO CLEAN MY DOOR LATCHES ON THE PASSENGER SIDE (FRONT AND BACK) DOORS AND THE LIGHT WENT OFF FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.  I AM UNABLE TO LOCK MY DOORS.  I HAVE TO MANUALLY LOOK EACH DOOR BY ROLLING DOWN MY WINDOWS AND GETTING OUT AND MANUALLY PUSHING DOWN THE LOCK.  HOWEVER, WHILE DRIVING MY DOOR AJAR  LIGHT WILL COME BACK ON AS WELL AS MY INSIDE LIGHTS,MY DOORS WILL AUTOMATICALLY UNLOCK.  I CAN'T TURN MY ALARM ON AND 75% OF THE TIME LEAVE MY DOORS UNLOCKED.  I ASSUME MY DOOR IS PROMPTED AS IF SOMEONE IS TRYING TO OPEN MY DOOR WHEN MY CAR IS OFF WHICH IN RETURN CAUSES MY ALARM TO GO OFF.  IT HAS BEEN MANY TIMES WHEN I HAVE WENT TO THE PARKING GARAGE AND MY LIGHTS ARE FLASHING, OR I GET A CALL THAT MY ALARM IS GOING OFF, OR I AM AWAKENED/STARTLED IN MY HOUSE WHEN IT GOES OFF IN THE GARAGE.  MY CONCERN AND FEAR IS THAT SOMEONE WILL OPEN MY DOOR WHILE IM DRIVING/STOPPED AT A STOP SIGN OR RED LIGHT.  I HAVE ALREADY REPLACED MY BATTERY AND I'M SURE IT WAS DUE TO MY ALARMS CONSTATNLY GOING OFF OR DOME LIGHT/DASH BOARD COMING ON    ACCORDING TO MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP IT IS A LONG WAIT ON THE NEW AND IMPROVED REPLACEMENT LATCH.  I HAVE SCHEDULEDTO TAKE MY CAR BACK YET AGAIN NEXT MONDAY TO SEE IF I CAN GET ON THE LIST FOR A NEW LATCH.  I AM VERY DISPLEASED WITH HOW FORD IS HANDLING THIS ISSUE.  I CALLED THEM TODAY TO SEE IF THEY COULD GIVE ME STEPS ON HOW TO OVERRIDE THE DOOR LOCKS WITH NO SUCCESS.  IWAS TOLD TO GET IT REPAIRED AND IF THEY DECIDE TO RECALL I'LL GET A REFUND!",

THE TECH ADVISED SINCE IT STARTED THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING FURTHER. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE BATTLEFIELD FORD DEALER AND TOLD THEM THE ISSUE.  IT WAS DUE FOR A RECALL WHICH WOULD SWITCH OUT THE FUEL PUMP AND FUEL PUMP CONTROL MODULE AND WAS ADVISED THAT SHOULD FIX THE PROBLEM.  THE SERVICE WAS PERFORMED.

I INFORMED THEM THAT I NEEDED A CAR IN THE MEANTIME TO GHETTO WORK, ETC.  I WAS TOLD THAT THEY COULD NOT GIVE ME A LOANER AND THAT I SHOULD GET A RENTAL CAR AT MY OWN EXPENSE AND  THAT THERE MAY, OR MAY NOT, BE A POSSIBILITY OF A REFUND FOR THE RENTAL EXPENSE. I AM CURIOUS IF ANYONE ELSE HAS HAD THIS A/C PROBLEM WITH FORD AND IT  WAS CORRECTED?  *TR",

        "summary": "ABOUT A MONTH AFTER PURCHASING MY VEHICLE, ONE OF THE INFLATABLE SEATBELT BUCKLES CRACKED AT THE BUCKLE CASING.  A FEW WEEKS LATER, THE SECOND SEAT BELT BUCKLE CRACKED.  I HAD BOTH BUCKLES REPLACED AND NOW I HAVE A 3RD BUCKLE CRACK.  THIS MAKES THE SEATBELTS UNSAFE AND DIFFICULT TO OPERATE.  ADDITIONALLY, THE TOP PART OF THE SEAT BELT (WHERE THE INFLATABLE PORTION ORIGINATES) BECOMES TWISTED AND STUCK AT THE TOP, AND MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PULL OUT THE SEAT BELT AND USE IT.  THIS INFLATABLE SEATBELT FEATURE IS IN THE SECOND ROW WHERE MY CHILDREN SIT.  THEY ARE UNABLE TO USE THE SEATBELTS UNASSISTED AS THEY ARE HEAVY AND DIFFICULT TO MANIPULATE EVEN WHEN THEY ARE WORKING PROPERLY.  THIS NEW FEATURE IS UNSAFE AND MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE EACH AND EVERY TIME THEY ARE USED. I PAID TO HAVE THESE SPECIAL SEATBELTS INCLUDED WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE, AND EVEN CHOSE THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE OF THIS NEW SPECIAL FEATURE.  I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEM REMOVED AND TO HAVE REGULAR STANDARD SEATBELTS INSTALLED. THANK YOU.  *TR",
