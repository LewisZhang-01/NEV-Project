I DON'T SPIN OR BURNOUT, YET THE CENTER OF THE TIRE NOW HAS A 2\" TO 3\" WIDE SECTION THAT APPEARS TO BE VANISHING AND HAS ACTUALLY LEFT A GROOVE IN MY TIRE. I DON'T FEEL SAFE RIDING THIS TIRE AND HAVE \"GROUNDED\" MY BIKE UNTIL I CAN GET ANOTHER TIRE. THE AVON VENOM TIRE I HAD BEFORE THIS GOT CLOSE TO 10000 MILES BEFORE A CHANGE WAS REQUIRED. THE RUBBER ON THE AVON COBRA FEELS SOFT AND MUST BE OF DIFFERENT MATERIAL/CONTRUCTION THAN THE PREVIOUS AVON VENOM TIRES. I FEEL THIS IS A FACTORY DEFECT OR FLAW IN THE MATERIALS USED TO MANUFACTURE THIS TIRE. MY OPTIONS FOR THIS SIZE TIRE ARE LIMITED AND MY PAST EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN POSITIVE WITH AVON. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEIR QUALITY BACK TO WHERE IT ONCE WAS WITH THE VENOM TIRES.  *KB",
