I BROKE THE LUG NUTS LOOSE WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS ON THE GROUND, THEN, USING THE JACK SUPPLIED WITH THE VEHICLE, I FOLLOWED THE PROCEDURE OUTLINED IN THE OWNER'S MANUAL TO POSITION THE JACK IN THE RECOMMENDED LOCATION TOWARD THE LEFT REAR AT THE IDENTIFIED JACKING LOCATION.  I RAISED THE VEHICLE JUST ENOUGH TO REMOVE THE WHEEL.  AS I WAS SPINNING THE LUG NUTS OFF, THE CAR FELL OFF THE JACK.  THIS OCCURRED BECAUSE RUST HAD COMPROMISED THE STRUCTURAL METAL AT THE JACKING LOCATION AND THE WEIGHT, WHILE THE CAR WAS BEING RAISED, CRUSHED THE WEAKENED STEEL.  FORTUNATELY, I WAS NOT TOO CLOSE AND WAS NOT CAUGHT UNDER THE WHEEL OR OTHER BODY PART.      UPON CLOSE INSPECTION IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE STRUCTURE OF THE CAR, AT THE RECOMMENDED JACKING LOCATION, HAD BEEN SEVERELY COMPROMISED BY RUST.  THE EXTENT OF THE RUST DAMAGE WAS NOT OBVIOUS UNTIL THE CAR FELL OFF THE JACK.  AT THAT POINT THE PAINT WHICH HAD BEEN HIDING THE DAMAGE HAD FALLEN OFF AS THE STRUCTURAL STEEL UNDER IT COLLAPSED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE CAR.  THERE IS ALSO A RUBBER PAD THAT CONTRIBUTED TO CONCEALMENT OF THE STRUCTURAL DAMAGE SINCE IT COVERED MOST OF THE DAMAGED AREA SURROUNDING THE STUD USED TO PROPERLY LOCATE THE TOP OF THE JACK.      I BELIEVE THIS TO BE A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE INJURY TO ANYONE WHO FOLLOWS THE PROCEDURE OUTLINED IN CHRYSLER'S OWNER'S MANUAL.  *TR",

THIS BREAKAGE CAN OCCUR AT ANY SPEED. IT SEEMS TO HAPPEN AT AROUND 100,000 MILES.

MY TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE REPLACED, WHICH WILL COST UPWARDS OF AROUND $2000. I DID  RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND I HAVE DISCOVERED SOME DISTURBING FACTS. CHRYSLER VANS FROM 1998-2002 HAVE A REPUTATION OF HAVING THIS TYPE OF FAILURE HAPPEN. THE CAUSE IS A DIFFERENTIAL PIN THAT SHOOTS THROUGH THE CASING OF THE TRANSMISSION. THERE IS NOTHING  THE CONSUMER CAN DO TO PREVENT THIS. NEWER MODELS OF THE CARAVAN 2003 AND LATER HAVE THE SAME TRANSMISSIONS BUT THEY NOW HAVE METAL PLATES INSTALLED WHICH KEEP THE PINS FROM BREAKING THROUGH THE CASING. I TRIED TO GET ASSISTANCE FROM CHRSYLER DIRECTLY, BUT ACCORDING TO THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT, THERE HAS BEEN NO PROBLEM WITH THESE TRANSMISSIONS. I ASKED THEM WHY THEN WERE THERE SEVERAL STORIES ON THE INTERNET OF CUSTOMERS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM THAT I JUST EXPERIENCED. THEY REPLIED THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO HELP ME. MY TRANSMISSION DID NOT WEAR OUT, IT FAILED. THE DIFFERENTIAL PINS SHOT OUT AND BROKE THE TRANSMISSION CASING.  IF YOU CALL LOCALLY OR ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND TRY TO LOCATE A USED TRANSMISSION FOR 1998-2002 CHRYSLER VANS YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT THE MAJORITY HAVE THE BROKEN CASES CAUSED BY THE DIFFERENTIAL PINS. THUS, THEY RECOMMEND REPLACING WITH A NEW TRANSMISSION THAT HAS THE CORRECTED PLATES INSIDE. I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT AT LITHIA DODGE, THEY HAVE ON AN AVERAGE 2 OR MORE OF THESE VANS COMING IN WITH THE SAME DEFECT.

THIS STRONG GAS SMELL DOES NOT OCCUR ALL THE TIME, BUT INTERMITTENTLY.  WE ARE CONCERNED FOR MAYBE A FIRE OCCURING.  WHERE IS THIS STRONG SMELL COMING FROM?  I CALLED THE CHRYSLER ASSISTANCE NUMBER AND WAS TOLD IT WAS MY WORD AGAINST THE DEALERS AND THEY WOULD DO NOTHING.  I HAVE SERVERAL WITNESSES TO THE STRONG GAS SMELL.  WE REMAIN CONCERNED, ESPECIALLY SINCE NO ONE WILL DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  WE JUST WONDER IF THERE IS A SIMILARITY TO THE RECENT PROBLEM YOU HAVE REPORTED.   WE WANT THIS CORRECTED, BUT HAVE HIT A DEAD END EVERY WHERE WE TURN.  WE UNDERSTAND IT IS HARD FOR A DEALER TO FIND THE PROBLEM WHEN IT DOES NOT HAPPEN ALL THE TIME AND THERE IS NO SPECIFIC PATTERN AS TO WHEN IT WILL OCCUR. BUT   WE DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN AND WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT A FIRE IN OUR CAR.  TO US, THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION.
