After speaking with the technician, they told me they'd gone through with a boroscope and saw nothing out of the ordinary and recommended a new valve cover since the PCV was bad. I opted to order replacement spark plugs, coils, an eccentric valve sensor, and figured why not replace the Vanos bolts while in there too.  Unfortunately after getting the cover off, it's been discovered that 7! of the Vanos bolts have already either sheared off or backed out. Pretty much a worst case scenario as my car was built in 2010 and is just outside the 10 year unlimited mile warranty outlined in the service bulletin (https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/201...4V176-2716.pdf).  This service warranty does not appear long enough, and the item should have been recalled instead of warrantied. (Similar years similar issue in the BMW N55 motor was recalled https://www.autoblog.com/2014/04/11/bmw-broadens-engine-bolt-recall-nearly-half-million-cars-worldwide/)",
