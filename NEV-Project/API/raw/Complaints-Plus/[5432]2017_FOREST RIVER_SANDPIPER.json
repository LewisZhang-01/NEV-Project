WE NEEDED TO INCREASE THE WEIGHT CAPACITY FOR THE LEAF SPRINGS ON THAT SIDE.  BECAUSE WE INCREASED IT ON THE ONE SIDE, WE HAD TO INCREASE IT ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE AS WELL.  OUR CAMPER IS NOT EVEN A YEAR OLD, AND FOREST RIVER HAS REFUSED TO HONOR THEIR WARRANTY.  THEY HAVE INSTEAD SAID THAT IT IS DEXTERS ISSUE.  DEXTER HAS STATED THAT THEY WILL ONLY REPLACE THE CURRENT LEAF SPRINGS THAT ARE INADEQUATE FOR THE WEIGHT.  WE ARE NOW $470 OUT OF POCKET BECAUSE FOREST RIVER REFUSES TO HONOR A WARRANTY FOR A SAFETY ISSUE.",
