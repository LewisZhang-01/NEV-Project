Yes, I work at a gm dealership and see this issue often, they are very similar to the Toyota trucks that had rusted frames replaced under recall. No it has not been inspected but they're is no way that it would pass an annual inspection, therefore the truck is rendered useless. There were no warnings that the frame was almost rotted in half.

THIS SYSTEM IS INTENDED TO DISABLE THE FUEL SYSTEM ON A VEHICLE IF IT DETECTS THAT THE IGNITION HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH OR IN IMPROPER KEY HAS BEEN USED TO TRY AND START THE VEHICLE.  MY ISSUE IS THAT INTERMITTENTLY WHEN I TRY TO START MY TRUCK WITH THE FACTORY KEY, THE PASSLOCK SYSTEM ENGAGES AND DOES NOT ALLOW ME TO START MY TRUCK.  I HAVE TO WAIT 10 MINUTES IN ORDER FOR THE PASSLOCK SYSTEM LIGHT TO TURN OFF ON THE DASHBOARD. SOMETIMES MY TRUCK WILL START AFTER THIS 10 MINUTE LOCKOUT PERIOD.  IT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE WHERE MY TRUCK WILL FAIL TO START AFTER THE FIRST LOCKOUT PERIOD AND I HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 10 MINUTES.  ONCE THE PASSLOCK SYSTEM ALLOWS ME TO START THE ENGINE, MY TRUCK RUNS FINE WITH NO ISSUES. IN MY OPINION, THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN.  IN ANY EMERGENCY SITUATION, I WOULD HOPE TO DEPEND ON MY TRUCK STARTING.  THIS MALFUNCTIONING PASSLOCK SYSTEM PREVENTS ME FROM STARTING MY TRUCK.  MY GREATEST ISSUE WITH THIS SITUATION IS THAT MY TRUCK IS NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT IS AFFECTED BY THIS. A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH OF \"GMC CANYON PASSLOCK\" WILL SHOW PAGES UPON PAGES OF FORUMS OF OTHER TRUCK OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.   I LIVE IN AN AREA OF THE COUNTRY WITH A HIGH RISK OF FOREST FIRES.  I KNOW FRIENDS WHO HAVE BEEN EVACUATED FROM THEIR HOMES IN THE PAST.
