HE IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THAT THE REAR WHEELS HAD A FAIRLY NOTICEABLE NEGATIVE CAMBER, MORE SO ON THE RIGHT REAR THAN THE LEFT REAR, OF ABOUT 2 DEGREES, THEN WHEN HE PUT THE CAR ON THE RACK, HE FOUND THE FRONT TIRES HAD A SMALL TOE IN PROBLEM THAT COULD BE ADJUSTED BUT THE REAR SUSPENSION HAD NO PROVISION FOR ADJUSTMENT OF THE CAMBER. I DID SOME INVESTIGATIONS ON THE INTERNET TO SEE HOW OTHERS WERE DEALING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, AND FOUND THAT A LOT OF OTHER TSX OWNERS WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL AFTERMARKET MANUFACTURERS MAKING REAR SUSPENSION ADJUSTMENT KITS. I THEN STOPPED IN TO MY REGULAR ACURA DEALER REPAIR DEPARTMENT AND TALKED WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER TO SEE WHAT COULD BE DONE. HE SAID THAT IF I HAD BROUGHT THE CAR IN DURING THE WARRANTY PERIOD, I WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED, BUT SINCE THE CAR WAS OVER THE 50,000 MILE WARRANTY PERIOD, I WAS OUT OF LUCK. I ASKED HIM WHAT THE FACTORY SPECIFICATIONS WERE FOR THE REAR CAMBER, AND HE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS A MINUS 1 DEGREE, PLUS OR MINUS 30 MINUTES. I PRESSED HIM FURTHER, POINTING OUT THAT THIS DEFECT WAS BUILT INTO THE CAR AND THAT THE MILEAGE ON THE CAR HAD NO BEARING ON THE AMOUNT OF CAMBER, AND THAT IF I HAD BROUGHT THE CAR IN TO THEIR SHOP TO GET THE REAR CAMBER BROUGHT INTO FACTORY SPECS, THE SHOP WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT WITHOUT A NEW REAR LINKAGE KIT. I HAVE NOTICED THE REAR CAMBER PROBLEM ON MOST TSX'S IN THIS GENERATION OF THE CAR WHEN I'M OUT AND ABOUT. THE SERVICE MANAGER DID TELL ME THAT EVERYONE KNOWS THAT YOU ONLY GET 25-30K MILES OUT OF A SET OF TIRES ON A TSX, AND I AGREED BUT POINTED OUT THAT  WAS ONLY BECAUSE THE REAR CAMBER DESIGN DEFECT CAUSES GREATLY INCREASED WEAR ON THE INNER PART OF THE TIRE. MY MECHANIC USUALLY SETS THE REAR CAMBER AT A -1/4 TO 1/2 DEGREE, AND WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY THE ACURA DESIGN TEAM DID THIS. *TR",
