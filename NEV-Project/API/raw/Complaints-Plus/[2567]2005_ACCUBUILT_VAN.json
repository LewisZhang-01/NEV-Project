ALL TIRES WERE RUBBING. THE OWNER DID  NOT WISH TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE TIRES, JUST  ABOUT THE VEHICLE. THE OWNER  TRIED TO SPEAK WITH THE PLACE HE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE, BUT THEY WON'T SEE HIM ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY CLAIMED THESE PROBLEMS WERE IN HIS HEAD. THE VEHICLE CAME WITH A 2000 POUND JACK, AND THEN THE DEALERSHIP CHANGED IT TO A DIFFERENT JACK WITH A LIMIT OF 1000 POUNDS. THIS DEALERSHIP REPAIRED THE TONGUE JACK IN APRIL. THE OWNER ARGUED WITH THE DEALERSHIP, WHO SAID THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT UNBALANCED..  THE OWNER  CALLED THE MANUFACTURER, AND WAS WAITING TO HEAR FROM THEM. ANOTHER MANUFACTURER HAD TO BE CHOSEN BECAUSE THERE WERE NO LISTINGS FOR SUNRAY.  *AK",
