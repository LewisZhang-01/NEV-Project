I was able to park my Outback, and saw evidence of brake fluid leaking from under the right rear passenger seat. After pulling the lower rear seat cushion off, and pulling the brake line grommet out of the body, I saw, through the hole the brake lines go through, a fitting that had bare rusty brake lines attached to it, covered in brake fluid, with plastic sheathing that started about an inch from the fitting. After I discovered that there have been a lot of outbacks with the same problem, I found out that there was a recall years ago, so I called a local dealership. The person I spoke with said that the previous owner of my vehicle had neglected to have the brake lines serviced during the recall and that the recall expired years ago, so I would have to pay for replacing the defective line myself.",

Cold weather seems to exacerbate the crack and cause the component to fail intermittently. Many have reported this problem with their Subaru and have made repairs by touching up the solder.

INCLUDED IN THE RECALL IS A PRELIMINARY MEASURE TO APPLY SOME RUST-PROOFING COATING TO THE AREAS IN QUESTION. IF THAT ACTION IS TAKEN, THE RECALL IS CONSIDERED 100% RESOLVED PERMANENTLY. THIS RESOLUTION CRITERION IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE, AS THE RECALL MAY NOT BE DONE BY A VEHICLE OWNER UNTIL THE BRAKE LINES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRODED BUT JUST BEFORE THEY START LEAKING DUE TO CORROSION. THE ONLY ACCEPTABLE RESOLUTION TO A RECALL FOR CORRODED BRAKE LINES IS THE REPLACEMENT OF THOSE BRAKE LINES, NOT SOME MEAGER BAND-AID THAT SUBARU IS EFFECTIVELY CLAIMING IS A PERMANENT FIX TO THE ISSUE. THAT IS NOT TRUE AT ALL, AS BRAKE LINES WILL CONTINUE TO CORRODE TO A DEGREE EVEN IF THEY HAVE SOME COATING ON THEM, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE COATING CAN WEAR OFF.    THIS RECALL WAS SUPPOSEDLY ADDRESSED ON MY PARTICULAR VEHICLE BY CITYSIDE SUBARU OF BELMONT, MA. HOWEVER, 2.5 YEARS LATER, THERE IS OBVIOUSLY NO RUST-PROOFING COATING REMAINING. EITHER THE DEALERSHIP DIDN'T DO THE RECALL PROPERLY (OUT OF SCOPE OF THIS ISSUE SUMBISSION TO THE NHTSA), OR THE COATING WORE AWAY COMPLETELY. HOWEVER, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S THE FORMER OF THOSE TWO.",

I CONTACTED SUBARU DIRECTLY ON THE SAME DAY AND INCLUDED A COPY OF THE COMPLAINT I FILED WITH NHTSA AND MY BILL FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE OVERHEAD AIRBAG CONTROL MODULE.  IN THE REPORT THE SUBARU TECH SAID THE UNIT WAS SHORTING OUT, SHOWING CODE \"26 FOR PASSENGER?S AIRBAG INDICATOR FAILURE AND S8 AIRBAG LIGHT ON.\" I ALSO GAVE SUBARU MY TALLY OF MY FIRST CURSORY SEARCH OF THE NHTSA COMPLAINTS DATABASE ON THE WORD \"AIRBAG\" FOR ALL MODELS OF SUBARU FROM 2000 TO PRESENT.  THE SEARCH RESULTED IN 145 COMPLAINTS.  AFTER I LOOKED THROUGH THE FIRST 60 COMPLAINTS I FOUND 45 OF THEM THAT SEEMED TO BE ABOUT THIS EXACT PROBLEM - THE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT ON THE DASHBOARD AND/OR PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG OVERHEAD INDICATOR GOING ON AND OFF INTERMITTENTLY.  THESE COMPLAINTS WERE ACROSS EVERY MODEL OF SUBARU AND YEARS FROM 2003 TO 2013.  MY 2008 OUTBACK HAD THE MOST COMPLAINTS - 13.  OTHER SEARCHES FOR DIFFERENT KEY WORDS AND SPELLINGS OF AIRBAG RESULTED IN MANY HUNDREDS OF RESULTS, TOO MANY FOR YOUR DATABASE TO DISPLAY, PROBABLY MANY OF THEM WERE ABOUT THE RECENT AIRBAG RECALL ISSUE. SUBARU'S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY AND ON 2/12/15 THEY PROMISED TO REIMBURSE ME FOR THE ENTIRE $352, THE TOTAL COST OF PARTS AND LABOR TO REPLACE THE MODULE.  I URGE ALL SUBARU OWNERS TO TEST THEIR PASSENGER AIRBAG LIGHTS AND THOSE WITH PROBLEMS TO LODGE A FORMAL NHTSA COMPLAINT AND REPORT IT TO SUBARU.   SINCE THE AIRBAG DOESN'T WORK WHEN THE LIGHT ISN'T WORKING PROPERLY THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM!  ENOUGH COMPLAINTS TO THE NHTSA WILL HELP PRESSURE SUBARU TO FINALLY LET ALL POTENTIALLY AFFECTED OWNERS KNOW ABOUT IT.    *TR",
