I have had to have the automatic locks replaced on the door, but now the automatic sliding door won't close all the way when pushed, and even though it's ajar the van doesn't sense it and notify the driver with the warning light.  I took the van to Billy Craft Chrysler on 1/27/22.  They identified the issue as the door latch/actuator failing internally.  Because it is failing, it cannot identify if the door is open or closed.  I have four children that ride in the back and several times have driven with them, thinking the door is closed only to hear air once I start driving.  It is a serious safety concern that the warning light doesn't come on when the door is ajar.  Also, when the button is pushed to close the door, it now is unable to close the door completely.

They took out and replaced all the spark plugs and housing units again and even replaced the fuel pump.  Reset the check engine light and it still came back on.  Upon checking the internet for possible issues, I found it was reported from over 100 Dodge Grand Caravan owners this same exact issue.  After doing the tune up exactly as we did replacing the same parts we have replaced twice they have all still had the same issue.  This has been found that it is an engine cylinder that has gone bad.  I do not see how this cannot be considered a recall when multiple owners have had the exact same issue.  This is only a 2018 vehicle and to already have major engine issues is not ok and to see that I am not the only one.

It makes this sound every time the car door is locked. A month or so after it began making that noise, the door became stuck and would not open. It did not matter if the door was unlocked or not the door could not be opened at all. Then all of a sudden out of nowhere, the door became unstuck. A few weeks after that it became stuck again. This makes no sense, as I haven't done anything to warrant this issue. The right side sliding door also will not lock when the lock button is pressed. I have to manually open the door to lock or unlock the back sliding door on the right side. This is so frustrating. This issue is no longer \"covered\" by the warranty and it is incredibly annoying, not to mention expensive to have fixed. I bought this car new! It would seem to me the door being stuck and not being able to open is a major safety hazard. This should be a recall and customers should not have to pay 1,000$ or more to have this fixed. I cannot afford to have this fixed at this time so I am just having to live with it. I pray that if we are ever in a car accident that my children and I will be able to open the door and exit the vehicle safely and not be trapped inside.",

I took it to a local mechanic at home in August and he said I had bad fuel so he put in a fuel treatment and had me fill up with premium fuel one to two times.  This seemed to help only marginally.  A month later I took the van to another mechanic and he determined that there was a misfire in cylinder #2. He performed a relative compression test and said the engine will need to be disassembled and inspected. He called a local dealer and found the warranty was 5 years/60,000 miles.  He suggested I call my dealer because this shouldn't be happening even outside of the warranty.  I did. They offered no solutions.  Very frustrating.",

THIS OCCURRED WITHOUT WARNING; THE DOOR WAS OPERABLE IN YERMO AND THERE WERE NO UNUSUAL SOUNDS THAT WOULD INDICATE AN IMPENDING PROBLEM.    AFTER A LITTLE RESEARCH, I FOUND THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH GRAND CARAVANS, AND IS USUALLY CAUSED BY A FAILURE OF THE ELECTRONIC LOCK ACTUATOR.

THE THING THAT TROUBLES ME ABOUT THE ELECTRONIC LOCK FAILURE IS THAT IT PREVENTS THE USER FROM MANUALLY UNLOCKING THE DOOR. IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH 49 CFR 571.602 S4.3 FOR ONLY THREE YEARS. THEN DODGE CHARGES ~$1,100 TO REPLACE THE FAILED ACTUATOR, MEANING THAT THE ANNUALIZED COST TO THE DRIVER IS $367 PER REAR DOOR.    WE HAVE FOUR YOUNG KIDS WITH AGES RANGING FROM 8 YEARS TO 5 MONTHS. THE INFANT CAR SEAT WAS PLACED ON THE PASSENGER SIDE, SO OUR OTHER THREE CHILDREN COULD ONLY REALLY ENTER AND EXIT THE VAN FROM THE DRIVER SIDE. THE FAILURE OF THE DRIVER-SIDE DOOR MEANT THAT WE HAD TO REMOVE THE ENTIRE INFANT CAR SEAT TO ALLOW THE OTHER KIDS EGRESS FROM THE VAN.

THERE IS NO ROAD LIGHTING IN THAT AREA AND NO OTHER CARS WERE AROUND SO I COULD NOT SEE THE ROAD OR ANYTHING AROUND ME.

I TRIED THE HAZARD LIGHTS AND THEY WORKED SO I TRIED AS HARD AS I COULD TO PULL THE WHEEL TO THE RIGHT TO GET TO THE SHOULDER. I ENDED UP HITTING A GUARD RAIL AND THAT'S WHAT ULTIMATELY STOPPED THE VEHICLE. I WAS ABLE TO PUT IT IN PARK, AND THEN I CALLED 911.     I TRIED TO RESTART THE VEHICLE AND IT WORKED FINE.
