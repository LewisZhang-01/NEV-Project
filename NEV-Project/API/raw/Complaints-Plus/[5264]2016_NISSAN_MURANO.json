I was notified by the Nissan service department that the heated seat module had melted and that they needed to disconnect the component because it was a safety concern. It was very concerning to learn that the heated seat component could have possibly caused personal harm to anyone driving my vehicle.  I reached out to Nissan in an effort to have them fix the defect and they refused to fix the vehicle free of charge. I have also researched this defect online and there seems to be a pattern of this defect happening in other vehicles of this model and year. I believe that this is a serious safety issue and that Nissan should be investigating the heated seat components on these vehicles and fix the component, so they are safe and in working order.",

TO BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE NOTHING HIT THE WINDOW, NO CAR WAS ON EITHER SIDE OF US. PIECES OF GLASS CUT PASSENGER, BUT LUCKILY NONE GOT INTO EYES OF PASSENGER OR DRIVER. THIS CAUSED DRIVER TO SWERVE , BUT RECOVERED CONTROL. SMALL PIECES OF GLASS IN DRIVER'S HAIR ETC. HAD TO DRIVE 350 MILES HOME IN COLD WEATHER . TOOK VEHICLE TO A DEALER [ TRAVELLING , SO NOT SELLING DEALER]. DEALER NOTIFIED MANUFACTURER OF PROBLEM AND REPORT OF INCIDENT. MANUFACTURER RESPONDED THAT SINCE ALL PIECES OF GLASS COULD NOT BE RECOVERED, THEY COULD NOT REASSEMBLE ENTIRE WINDOW, THEREFOR IMPOSSIBLE TO TEST GLASS FOR DEFECTS. YET THERE WAS LARGE AMOUNT OF GLASS INSIDE OF VEHICLE. OWNER STATED THAT BY THAT REASONING NO SHATTERED WINDOW WOULD EVER BE INVESTIGATED, SO HOW WOULD ANYONE KNOW IF DEFECTIVE? CONCERN IS WITH REMAINING WINDOWS IN SAME VEHICLE AS WELL AS OTHERS MFG AT SAME TIME. MIGHT SOMETHING , UNBEKNOWN TO OWNER , HAVE STRUCK SUBJECT WINDOW PREVIOUSLY WHILE PARKED UNATTENDED, LEAVING NO MARK, BUT WEAKENING GLASS ALLOWING FUTURE SUDDEN SHATTER ? MAYBE. BUT POSSIBILITY ALSO EXISTS OF DEFECTIVE GLASS OR INSTALLATION DURING ASSEMBLY, BUT MANUFACTURER REFUSED TO INVESTIGATE THAT POSSIBILITY REPEATING THAT THEY WOULD NEED EVERY PIECE OF GLASS[IMPOSSIBLE]. IF OTHER SAME MAKE AND MODEL EXPERIENCE SAME, IT INCREASES DEFECT POSSIBILITY. IF OUR INCIDENT IS ONLY ONE, IT INCREASES CHANCE OF OURS BEING PREVIOUSLY DAMAGED. AT MINIMUM, ALL DRIVERS BE AWARE, AS WE NARROWLY ESCAPED DISASTER IN ABOVE CASE. DEALER WAS VERY HELPFUL, MANUFACTURER CONCERNED AND HELPFUL, BUT RESTATED THEY COULD NOT TEST GLASS  WITHOUT ALL PIECES. DOES MFG MAKE, OR PURCHASE GLASS FROM VENDOR?",

        "summary": "NISSAN MURANO COMPLAINT,  I PURCHASED A 2016 NISSAN MURANO IN MAY OF 2016 AND SINCE I HAVE OWNED IT I HAVE BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM BOGGING DOWN ACCELERATION IF I AM COMING OFF A CURB CUT OR GOING OVER A POT HOLE OR IRREGULARITIES IN THE ROAD.  I LIVE OFF A  55 MPH  ROAD WHERE I AM REQUIRED TO GET INTO THE LEFT LANE TO MAKE A TURN IN ABOUT A 1/3RD  OF A MILE AFTER MAKING A RIGHT ON HIGHWAY AND THE ENGINE BOGGS DOWN AND WILL NOT ACCELERATE AFTER GOING OVER ROAD IRREGULARITIES PUTTING ME IN CONSTANT DANGER EVERY DAY LEAVING FOR WORK. THE SAME PROBLEM HAS HAPPENED MAKING A LEFT TURN ACROSS TRAFFIC IF A POT HOLE IS PRESENT AND I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM COMING OUT OF STORES OR SHOPPING CENTERS DUE TO CURB CUTS. THE CAR JUST WILL NOT ACCELERATE AND TAKES OVER 16 SECONDS TO ACCELERATE FROM 0-60 MPH LEAVING ME WITH MANY CARS COMING DOWN ON MY BACK AT 55 MPH WHICH IS VERY SCARY AND PLACES ME IN DANGER ALMOST EVERY DAY. MAKING LEFTS AT LARGE INTERSECTIONS CAN ALSO BE VERY SCARY, BECAUSE I NEVER KNOW IF I WILL BE T-BONED IF THERE IS IRREGULARITY IN THE INTERSECTION. THE PROBLEM OCCURS FROM A DEAD STOP WITH THE ENGINE HOT OR COLD.   I DID A TEST DRIVE WITH A NISSAN TECHNICIAN AND HE WAS ABLE TO SEE THE PROBLEM FIRST HAND, BUT SAYS THAT THE CAR IS SUPPOSED TO DO THAT DUE TO THE TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM. WE THEN TURNED THE SYSTEM OFF AND THE SAME PROBLEM HAPPENED AGAIN. THIS IS A VERY SCARY DEFECT THAT PUTS MY LIFE IN DANGER ALMOST EVERY DAY.  I HAVE LIVED IN THE SAME DEVELOPMENT FOR 15 YEARS AND NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH ANY OTHER CAR THAT I OWNED, IF THIS DEFECT IS INHERENT IN THIS VEHICLE, THE CAR SHOULD BE RECALLED. NISSAN HAS PRETTY MUCH WASHED THEIR HANDS OF THE SITUATION AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN.  THANK YOU",
