INITIAL EFFORTS TO RESTART THE VEHICLE WERE UNSUCCESSFUL, SO I CALLED AAA FOR ASSISTANCE. AFTER ABOUT 15 MINUTES, AND BEFORE AAA ARRIVED, I WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE CAR AND DROVE HOME (IT WAS A SUNDAY).

AFTER WHAT I WAS TOLD WAS A COMPLETE CHECK, NO APPARENT REASON FOR THE ENGINE QUITTING COULD BE FOUND. I DROVE THE CAR HOME AND AROUND TOWN FOR SEVERAL DAYS, WHEN THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. THIS TIME WHEN I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP I TOLD MY SERVICE CONSULTANT THAT I REFUSED TO DRIVE THE CAR, WHICH I OCCASIONALLY USED TO TRANSPORT MY YOUNG GRANDCHILDREN, UNTIL THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED AND REPAIRED. WE AGREED THAT ONE OF THE MECHANICS COULD USE IT FOR HIS PERSONAL USE UNTIL THE PROBLEM REOCCURRED. AND IT DID. A FEW DAYS LATER THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT THE CAR HAD AGAIN STALLED, THAT THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN DIAGNOSED, AND THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHARGE WHEN I PICKED UP THE VEHICLE.

MY TIRE PRESSURE DROPS SO I HAVE TO PUT AIR IN THE TIRES EVERY 3 TO 4 DAYS.   WE HAVE ONLY OWNED THE CAR SINCE JANUARY, 2012.   IT WAS PURCHASED AT COLUSSEY CHEVROLET IN BRIDGEVILLE.  IT WAS A CERTIFIED VEHICLE SO I FEEL THEY SHOULD HAVE CHECKED IT OUT AND REALIZED THE WHEELS WERE STARTING TO FLAKE.  I SPOKE TO GM REP.  AT 1-866-790-5700, EXT. 21733 IN AUGUST, 2013, AND WAS ASSIGNED GM FILE NO. 71-1235298454.  SHE SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MGR. AT COLUSSEY, AND HE WAS GOING TO GIVE ME REFURBISHED WHEELS FOR MY CAR AT AN APPROXIMATE COST $300 A WHEEL.  HE SAID THROUGH GM THEY WOULD COST ABOUT $480.  I HAVE CALLED NUMEROUS TIMES AND LEFT MESSAGES, AND NO ONE HAS CALLED BACK TO GET THIS RESOLVED.  I KNOW I AM NOT ALONE, BECAUSE ONLINE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF GM OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM ON GM VEHICLES AND GMC TRUCKS.

I WENT TO ARNIE BAUER DEALER WHO ROAD FORCED BALANCED THEM AND FOUND 2 BAD TIRES. THEY REPLACED THESE 2 BAD TIRES, SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT BUT STILL VIBRATIONS.

I WAS DENIED TO SPEAK DIRECTLY WITH THE REP. GM HAD TO GO ALONG WITH ARNIE BAUER'S EVALUATION, AND THE REP STATED THEY COULD NOT GET ME NEW TIRES. I THEN DID SOME SEARCHING ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND A FORUM ON EDMUNDS.COM(HTTP://TOWNHALL-TALK.EDMUNDS.COM/DIRECT/VIEW/.F0F60B1/0). THERE ARE 18 OR MORE PAGES DETAILING FOLKS NIGHTMARE WITH THE SAME ISSUE I AM HAVING. IT APPEARS MANY FOLKS ARE HAVING VIBRATION ISSUES WITH THE LUCERNE. SOME FOLKS HAD THE ISSUE RESOLVED WITH TIRE CHANGES TO MICHELIN HX MXM4 TIRES. I SENT THIS INFORMATION TO GM AND HAD IT ADDED TO MY SERVICE REQUEST FILE. NEXT I WENT TO BILL KAY TO SEE IF THEY COULD HELP ME. THEY DID A TIRE BALANCE AND I STILL HAVE A VIBRATION. THEY STATED THEY COULD NOT GET ME THE MICHELIN TIRES. THIS ISSUE WILL LEAD TO SOME CATASTROPHIC EVENT IF NOT ADDRESSED.  ALL I REALLY WANTED WAS THE DEALER TO REPLACE THE TIRES WITH MICHELINS AS IT SEEMS TO SOLVE MANY OTHERS' PROBLEMS. I THINK GM OR BRIDGESTONE NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED ON THIS. ALSO, I WENT TO 2 DEALERSHIPS AND TEST DROVE 4 BRAND NEW 2008 LUCERNES AND THEY ALL VIBRATE EVEN WORSE THAN MY CAR. THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME TIRES. I SPENT TOO MUCH MONEY FOR A CAR TO RIDE SO POORLY AND THEN BE TOLD THIS IS HOW IT WAS DESIGNED.
