WE'VE TRAVELED ALL OVER THE SOUTH HAD THIS HAPPEN TOO OFTEN. THE A/C HAS GONE OUT 3 TIMES, WE'VE HAD LEAKS IN THE REAR AXLE TWICE, WE THINK THEY ARE CAUSED BY THE VIBRATION. IF THESE ARE THINGS WE SEE, WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING? IN BOYNTON BEACH THE FORD DEALER SAID THE VIBRATION SOUNDED LIKE A TIE ROD. THAT'S ALL WE HAD TO HEAR. FORD TOWED THE RV TO FORT LAUDERDALE FROM BOYNTON BEACH TO ATLANTIC FORD. THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD DUPLICATED THE PROBLEM. GREAT. WHEN WE PICKED IT UP, WE FOUND THEY HADN'T. WE TOOK IT AND HEADED TO NEW YORK STATE. ON ROUTE 40 IN TENNESSEE, IT HAPPENED AGAIN. T. PULLED OFF THE ROAD, STOPPED, STARTED. I WAS FURIOUS. EVERY TIME WE WENT OVER A SEAM IN THE ROAD, IT WOULD SHAKE AND WE'D HAVE TO PULL OFF THE ROAD. TRY DOING THAT IN CONSTRUCTION. SINCE MAY, IT HAS BEEN AT CAMPING WORLD, SYRACUSE, DUPLICATED THE PROBLEM, SCARED THE HECK OUT OF THEM, COULDN'T FIND A PROBLEM. FORD SAID \"TRY AIR BAGS TO HOLD THE FRONT DOWN.
