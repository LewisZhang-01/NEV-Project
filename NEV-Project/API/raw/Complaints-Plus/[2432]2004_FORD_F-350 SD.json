I TOLD HIM IT WAS A TIRE OR WHEEL PROBLEM AND NO COMPUTER WOULD BE NEEDED BUT HE REFUSED ANY FURTHER HELP AND WAS VERY RUDE. FORD MTR, CO. WAS CONTACTED AND THEY CONTACTED LANGDALE ON MY BEHALF BUT GOT BRUSHED OFF TOO. THE WHEEL WAS FOUND BY A LOCAL TIRE SHOP AND THEY SAID THAT I HAD A UNSAFE WHEEL, IT HAD BEEN HEATED UP BY A CUTTING TORCH AND MADE TO FIT THIS TRUCK. THEY ORDER ME ANOTHER TIRE AND PUT IT ON THE SPARE RIM THAT HAD THE CORRECT TIRE SIZE BUT WOULD NOT MATCH THE OTHER TIRES ON THE TRUCK. UPON MY VISIT TO THE TIRE SHOP I WAS TOLD THAT THE WRONG SIZE TIRES HAD BEEN PUT ON BY LANGDALE FORD. THEY HAD PUT SIZE- 245/75R16 WIDER TIRES ON THE TRUCK AND IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE 235/85R16 NARROW TIRES AND THAT I COULD HAVE A PROBLEM WHEN WEIGHT WAS ADDED TO THESE TIRES IN THE REAR (DUEL TIRE TRUCK) CAUSING THE TIRES TO HEAT UP AND BLOW OUT. LUCKILY WE FOUND THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE TRAVELING WITH A LOAD AND THE BAD WHEEL  DID NOT BRAKE THE STUDS. THESE WHEELS/TIRES ARE HEAVY AND COULD HAVE BEEN A BAD AND DEADLY MISSILE ON THE HIGHWAY. I HAD ALSO FOUND THE TAIL PIPE LOSE FROM THE BACK TWO HANGERS THE DAY I BROUGHT THE TRUCK HOME BUT I FIXED THESE. THE DEALERS NEED TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR SAFETY OF VEHICLES THEY PUT ON THE PUBLIC HIGHWAYS. *TR",

ANOTHER UNIT  HAD THE ACCELERATOR JAM WIDE OPEN. UNIT BURNED UP THE BRAKING COMPONENTS FROM DRIVING TO OUR REPAIR SHOP.  DISCOVERED THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE END GUIDING TUBE WOULD FOLD DOWN ONTO THE INTAKE MANIFOLD AND JAM THE THROTTLE WIDE OPEN.  2001 THROUGH 2003 UNITS AFFECTED CURRENTLY HAD THESE CABLES DISCONNECTED AND HAD NO FURTHER RECURRENCES.

WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR UNITS AFFECTED AND WILL DISCONNECTED THEIR CABLES UNTIL A REMEDY IS AVAILABLE.  WE SPECULATE THIS CAN BE CAUSED BY THESE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS:    1)  INFLUENCED BY DRIVING CONDITIONS THAT PROMOTE RAPID CYCLING FROM WIDER THROTTLE OPENINGS FOLLOWED BY THE IMMEDIATE CLOSURE OF THE THROTTLE; AS WITH STOP AND GO DRIVING DEMANDS.  2)  CRUISE CONTROL CABLE END GUIDE COMPONENT \"DROOPING\" WITH HIGHER UNDER HOOD ENGINE TEMPERATURES.  THIS ALLOWS THE CABLE GUIDING SLEEVES TO NOT CORRECTLY OVERLAP AND PREVENT IT FROM FREELY SLIDING THROUGH.  THIS FORCES THE CABLE GUIDE SLEEVE DOWN TO JAM ONTO THE MANIFOLD.   3) HARMONIC FREQUENCY AMPLIFICATION OF COMBINED VIBRATIONS.    VIBRATIONS GENERATED FROM THE VEHICLE PITCHING FROM THE ROAD AND ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION MOTIONS.  THE KINETIC ENERGY OF THE MOVING CRUISE CONTROL CABLE COMPONENTS TRIES TO CONTINUE IT'S FORWARD OPENING MOTION WHEN IT IS SUDDENLY REVERSED WITH THE THROTTLE CLOSURE.  ANY EXCESS CABLE WITHIN THE GUIDING SLEEVE MAY STILL BE MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION UPON THROTTLE CLOSURE; POSSIBLY JAMMING INSIDE THE SLEEVE. *JB",
