There is no way this should be happening      I purchased through Greenway Kia in Franklin, TN in   I took the car back for the bumper/ SC201 recall and since then have had nothing but issues. I have established the below timeline as the basis of my complaint and frustration. Last year I tried to get a manager to call me back for months and no one called.  5/18/21- Returned car for the SC201 Aux Canister Installation recall  6/11/21-Less than a month later my engine light came on and I noticed issue with my oil having to be topped off often.  After a week or so in the shop and denied claims. I was told at this point that there was a canister issue unrelated to the recall.  This made no sense to me since the engine light did not come on until after the recall work was done  11/16/2021- Car engine ceased and stop as I was heading to work.  I had not yet reached 65 busy hwy.  If I had I might have been in an accident.  The car remained in the shop for almost a month.

I barely made it off the exit safely, because the vehicle would no longer accelerate. I could no longer drive it, and the sounds from the engine became increasingly louder. I had to have the vehicle towed to my mechanic, where it sits today, not able to drive, and according to him, in need of a new engine. This is very frustrating, especially since I have only had the vehicle for barely 6 months. I have all my invoices of regular oil changes, so I know this is not a problem I caused.

When I first contacted the NHTSA, I stated within the last few months that after driving the vehicle the highway or expressway for an extended period (approximately 60 mins to 90 mins), the steering wheel would bind when turning on the road to change lanes or maintain the vehicle on the road. This binding occurs in the turning position without warning. I'm concerned the steering will lock, which will result in a bad accident. I initially took the car to the dealership (Gunther KIA), where I purchased the vehicle. The service adviser told him because the steering wheel has electronic components, the problem could occur when the battery needed replacement. I agreed to have the battery replaced; however, the binding of the steering wheel re-occurred. After the second failure, I returned the car to the dealership's service dept. At the advice of their technicians, they performed a software update on the vehicle. Unfortunately, a couple of days after the second repair, the same failure recurred for the third time. Once again, I took the car back to the dealership, where a case was filed and opened; however, the dealership could not diagnose or duplicate the failure after a few days in their possession. At one point, the master adviser (Randy Rosario) at the dealership told me that he had the same experience with his own Sorrento. And he learned to deal with it and said I should learn to deal with it because the dealership would not give me a new vehicle. I replied by stating that I didn't want a new car; I wanted my car fixed because I feared for my safety and the safety of my family and grandchildren. The adviser also mentioned that a recall should happen, but the manufacturer has never issued one. The manufacturer had yet to be notified of the failure. As a result, the vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was 43,490 Fortunately, during the week of January 10th, 2022, I once again called the dealers",

The contact stated within the last few months that after driving the vehicle the highway or expressway for an extended period (approximately 60 mins to 90 mins), the steering wheel would bind when turning on the road to change lanes or maintain the vehicle on the road. This binding occurs in the turning position without warning. The contact had initially taken the car to the dealership (Gunther KIA), where he purchased the vehicle as new. The service adviser told him because the steering wheel has electronic components, the problem could occur when the battery needed replacement. The contact agreed to have the battery replaced; however, the binding of the steering wheel re-occurred. After the second failure, the vehicle was returned to the dealership\u2019s service dept. They performed a software update on the car. Unfortunately, a couple of days after the second repair, the same failure recurred for the third time. The contact had taken the vehicle back to the dealership, where a case was filed and opened; however, after a few days in their possession, the dealership could not diagnose or duplicate the failure. At one point, the master adviser at the dealership told the contact that he himself had the same experience with his own Sorrento. And he learned to deal with it and said to the contact (car owner) should learn to deal with it because the dealership would not give him a new vehicle. The contact replied by stating that he didn\u2019t want a new car; he wanted his car fixed because he fears for his family\u2019s, and grandchildren\u2019s safety. The adviser also mentioned that a recall should happen, but the manufacturer has never issued one. The manufacturer had yet to be notified of the failure. As a result, the vehicle was not repaired.

I have my oil changed every 3,000 miles and take very good car of a car they KNOW is going to break down. And still there is no recall. There are thousands of complaints about this exact problem. And people being forced to pay 5-7 grand out of pocket for an issue that MUST be covered. Kia KNOWS it\u2019s a problem and they all say well if anything else goes wrong we will test your car then \u201cmaybe\u201d it will be covered. Meanwhile, my car is literally a ticking time bomb.

I parked my Sorento and checked my phone. As I sat there which was about 2-3 minutes I heard another extremely loud pop and that is when the glass of my sunroof started shattering. I immediately got out of my car and looked up and noticed my sunroof looked as if it exploded upwards. Luckily I had the sun shade closed or glass would have fallen in the car and on me.  I googled sunroofs exploding and found several claims, a class action law suit (in progress) and a TV news investigation regarding Kia sunroof exploding while driving. My car is at the dealership currently and I haven't heard anything yet regarding the cause but from the conversation I had with the service advisor it doesn't seen to be an issue to KIA although there has been hundreds of reports filed. I believe it is a manufacturing defect. I have pictures and video of what appears to be the initial crack (the first loud pop) and the hole it caused (the second loud pop). There is no way an object caused the explosion and if so how can we explain the second pop while I was parked. It is ironic that others have reported the same incident occurring and the photos are very similar in all cases. Something has to be done before a child or adult is seriously injured.  I guess the right person/people have yet to be affected by this. It is a serious safety concern. My video would not load but I'm happy to send it as an attachment via email.",

I went to the dealership today( 05/14/2021) @ 11:00 @ Greenway Kia West 3407 West Colonial Drive Orlando Florida 32808,   to complain that my oil is running completely out of the engine and I was told all the fees I will have to pay in order to check this problem, I didn't say I had a leak or noise but disappearing. This is a manufacturers issues , and the warranty should cover. I told them my windshield is bubbling at the top and maybe separating , and still again all I heard was fees , I purchased a Kia Sorrento based on the good warranty and the place I felt very safe.

When I took my car to the dealer I was told that it wasn't covered under the warranty and that I must have driven over something to make it loose.  I had NOT driven over anything. I ended up purchasing bolts to replace the loose  portion of the splash shield.  Then, in January 2020, as the car was driven again, the splash shield came completely off the vehicle.  Again, there wasn't any object run over, it just came off.   In July 2020, we had the splash shield replaced, as the serpentine drive belt had snapped and gotten caught in the engine. In May 2021, the bolts in the splash shield again came out, and the shield was dragging on the ground.  Again, didn't hit any objects or run over anything.  Replaced the missing bolts.  Our safety was compromised when the shield came off completely and flew into traffic as we were driving.  This was also a risk for other people.  Then, due to the shield not being in place, and something caused the drive belt to snap and wrap up into the engine was a major safety concern, as I could have lost control of the car.

Not a single warning light or any weird sounds at all. A car pulled up yelling at me that my car was on fire to pull over off the interstate. I saw nor smelled any smoke anywhere but then I saw a cop had someone pulled over so I figured it would be safe since I was an alone female and it was car of males yelling at me to pull over. As soon as I got out and walked to the front of the car there was still no smoke but flames and what I assumed was plastic dripping from the entire underneath. At this time flames shot out from all around the hood and up the windshield as it instantly shattered. As I ran for my life as stuff kept exploding the state trooper had already called for help so fire department arrived in less then 3 min but my car was gone in less than 45 seconds after I stepped out. I am mentally and physically hurt but luckily only a burn the size of a quarter on my wrist but due to shock while watching my car burn and explode my legs gave out and I sat down hard so 5 days after the fire my legs have recovered from running up an incline for my life but my back pain has only increased. But insurance only covers injuries from the car so running from exploding cars and getting injured is not their problem. Just like Kia allowing all of us Sorento owners to drive our family and loved ones around on a bomb waiting to blow at any moment isn\u2019t their problem either. I have now seen at least 8 2017 Sorento sxl unexplained fire complaints all ending in total loss while only looking on this site and one other site. I have pictures and videos of the fire and how close I was to being in the car as u can see my hoodie laying in front of the car on fire too. Fire started on passenger side of motor just like the defect they supposedly fixed in 2014. If anyone else especially the grandchildren that can\u2019t get themselves out of would have died",

THE SOUND WAS SO LOUD, I THOUGHT I WAS REAR ENDED BY ANOTHER VEHICLE TRAVELING AT A HIGH SPEED. FRIGHTENED, I GLANCED AT MY REARVIEW MIRROR AND SEEN MY REAR WINDOW WAS INTACT.

NINE DAYS LATER ON 1/27,  IT WENT OUT AGAIN IN CAMBRIA, CA.  THIS TIME I WAS DRIVING BUT WAS ABLE TO MOVE TO A SAFE PLACE.  THE KIA DEALERSHIP IN PASO ROBLES SAID WHEN THE CAR ARRIVED THE LIGHT WAS OFF AND THERE WERE NO ISSUES WITH THE POWER STEERING.  I WAS TOLD THEY WOULD PUT MILES ON THE CAR IN AN EFFORT TO RECREATE THE PROBLEM.  THAT AFTERNOON AS IT WAS SET TO BE DRIVEN BY THE TECHNICIAN THE LIGHT WENT ON AND POWER STEERING WAS LOST.  I WAS TOLD THE TECHNICIAN SAW A PROBLEM IN THE FUSE BOX, HE FIXED IT AND THE CAR WAS ABLE TO BE DRIVEN.   I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THEY COULD DO.  THE SERVICE MANAGER WAS RUDE AND UNSYMPATHETIC.  MY CONCERNS WERE NOT VALIDATED OR ACKNOWLEDGED,  NEEDLESS TO SAY, I VERY UPSET BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE THE CAR.  ESPECIALLY, GIVEN THE FACT THAT WHAT THEY SAID THEY DID TO FIX THE PROBLEM DID NOT MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME.

SHE THEN TRIED TO RESTART THE CAR SEVERAL TIME BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFULLY IT IT STARTING BACK UP BEFORE IT STALLED OUT. AFTER THE CAR WAS LEFT ALONE FOR A WHILE I WENT OUT TO THE CAR AND IT STARTED BACK UP AND SEEMED LIKE IT DROVE FINE. WE DID NOT TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT TIME. AFTER THAT MY WIFE SAID THAT SHE FELT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DRIVING LIKE IT SHOULD. SHE SAID THAT YOU BASICALLY HAD TO FLOOR IT FOR IT TO GET UP TO CRUISING SPEED. APPROXIMATELY 6 WEEKS LATER MY WIFE STARTED TO HAVE MORE PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE. SHE STATED THAT THE ACCELERATION PROBLEM WAS VERY NOTICEABLE AND WAS SCARIED THAT IT WAS GOING TO STALL OUT AGAIN BEFORE SHE COULD GET HOME THAT DAY. SHE WAS ABLE TO GET HOME SAFE THAT TIME. LATER ON THAT DAY SHE HAD TO GO BACK OUT AND SHE SAID THAT IT STARTED UP FINE AND DROVE FINE UNTIL WITH OUT WARNING IT JUST SHUT OFF WHILE SHE WAS DRIVING IN THE MIDDLE OF BUSINESS INTERSECTION. THE CAR STARTED UP JUST FINE ONCE IT SHUT OFF AND MY WIFE DROVE IT TO A NEARBY PARKING LOT WHERE IT SAT UNTIL IT WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE DEALERSHIP HAS HAD THE VEHICLE ABOUT 3 WEEKS NOW AND ARE UNABLE REPLICATE THE PROBLEM. THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SEE IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE CAR. SINCE THEY CANNOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND THERE IS NO CODES THEN THEY THINK THAT THE VEHICLE IS FINE. SIN E THE CAR CUT OFF ON MY WIFE TWICE IN SIX WEEKS SHE IS SCARED TO DRIVE THE CAR IN FEAR THAT IT WILL SHUT OFF ON HER AGAIN. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY KIA.

I PUT THE VEHICLE IN PARK AND IT DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.  IT CONTINUED AN UNCONTROLLED HIGH POWER ACCELERATION.  I TURNED THE IGNITION OFF AS IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT ? STOPS IT!
