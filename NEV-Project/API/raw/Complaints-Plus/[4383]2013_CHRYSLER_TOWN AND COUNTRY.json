Then a new wrinkle emerged: the van conked out on us a few times while on the road -- once while merging onto a highway. We now had a serious (and potentially dangerous) problem on our hands. We had the fuel pump replaced, but the problem persisted. I took the van to our local Chrysler dealership to have them figure it out. They replaced the throttle body and cleaned the fuel injectors and fuel system. I drove the car home without incident, but the following morning, I tried to start it, and the same old situation emerged \u2014 the engine cranked but never turned over. I then had it towed back to the dealer for another round of diagnostics. I mentioned that I had seen on the Internet about a possible faulty Totally Integrated Power Module (TIPM), an issue in various Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep/Ram products. Later they called saying the battery was the problem (even though they earlier reported that the battery was okay), and had nothing to do with the TIPM. For about a week, the van is started up without a hitch, but then same old hesitating-before-starting situation reared its ugly head, albeit briefly. It is only a matter of time before it stalls out again in traffic. These vehicles should be recalled and the TIPM needs to be replaced.",

        "summary": "My Chrysler Town and Country has serious electrical issues. It started with the radio shutting off and restarting by itself, which is not a serious issue at all. But yesterday, at a red light, the radio shut off and so did the car. The engine stopped working, the accelerator pedal would not respond. It was terrifying. Thankfully we were at a red light, but if this were to happen on a busy highway, or even just on a regular street with traffic, it could be a life threatening situation.   From what I have researched online, this is a common problem with Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge cars. Legal action has been taken and class action lawsuits were filed to address this matter. The Center for Auto Safety (CAS) asked this very own NHTSA to open an investigation into faulty TIPM, which seem to be the problem that causes these cars to very dangerously completely shut off even while driving, causing drivers to lose control of the steering and of the brakes.   The CAS estimated 7 million Chrysler vehicles have power issues related to the TIPM. One month after receiving a class action lawsuit, Chrysler issued a recall for 189.000 Dodge Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee with bad TIPMS.   189.000. Out of SEVEN MILLION.  This is absurd.   It seems as if Chrysler is waiting for someone to be killed due to this issue so they can take it seriously and actually issue the recall to all the cars that have this problem, not a tiny fraction of them and not only because it is directly related to a lawsuit.  Unfortunately, despite multiple claims throughout the years that not only this is a common problem with Chrysler, but that the corporation is well aware of it and negligently refuses to address the issues, the NHTSA rejected the CAS petition to investigate this problem.   Proof is definitely not amiss, as a quick internet research will produce thousands upon thousands of reports of the same problem on the same car.   This needs to be a recall URGENTLY, and not only after someone dies.",

I am hoping they will respond to my request asap. Here is the note (minus the personal details): On July 27, 2021, I went to my driveway and saw that something was amiss with the driver\u2019s headrest. It seemed to have deployed for no reason. I Googled this and learned that it is a defective Active Head Restraint (AHR) system in many Chrysler vehicles, where the plastic breaks off and the headrest deploys unexpectedly when the car is not involved in an accident. I went to have a closer look and sure enough, the plastic piece in the headrest had broken off, causing the headrest to deploy. Because the plastic is broken, I cannot get the headrest to go back into place. This is definitely a defective part in the manufacturing of the vehicle. I am lucky that I was not driving at the time as I am sure it would have given me whiplash on top of the shock of having something like that explode behind my head which could have caused an accident.  I read online that there are several class action suits in process for this exact issue against Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. I don\u2019t necessarily want to take part in the law suit -- I just want to get this headrest fixed so that the car is safe to drive again. How can such an important component of the car just give away like that, time and time again, and not be a recall? There have been other recall issues on this car regarding the airbag -- but not this headrest, although I believe that Fiat Chrysler is well aware of the issue.    In any case, since it is not a recall issue, I am asking that you kindly extend my warranty to 10 years/unlimited mileage to cover this faulty headrest, and I will get it fixed as soon as possible. I am attaching pictures to show you the headrest, VIN, and odometer. Please rectify this situation. Thank you",

I WENT HOME AND ABOUT 30 MINUTES OF BEING HOME I WENT AND GOT IN MY VAN AND STARTED IT UP AND IT STARTED NORMALLY JUST AS IT ALWAYS DID. IT RAN FOR PRY 3 TO 5 SECONDS ONLY AND JUST DIED. I TRIED TO START IT BACK UP AND IT WOULD NOT START. TRIED STARTING IT FOR AN HOUR AND IT WOULD NOT START. THAT'S WHEN I RESEARCHED AND FOUND OUT ABOUT THE TIPM PROBLEM THAT DODGE HAS. I NEVER KNEW FOR SURE UNTIL RECENTLY IF THAT WAS INDEED WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. UNTIL RECENTLY AND ONLY FOUND OUT BECAUSE I SOLD MY HOUSE AND HAD TO GET IT MOVED OUT OF MY GARAGE WHERE MY VAN SAT SINCE THE DAY IT DIED. I WAS NOT ABLE TO DRIVE MY VAN FOR PRY OVER 2 YEARS. MY VAN IS A 2013 AND HAS ABOUT 80,000 MILES ON IT. WE ARE THE ONLY OWNER. AFTER PAYING ALMOST $40,000 FOR A BRAND NEW VEHICLE I DEFINITELY DIDNT THINK I WOULD NOT BE VEHICLE LESS ANYTIME SOON. ONCE MY HOUSE WAS SOLD I HAD SOMEONE I KNEW COME TO TRY TO GET IT STARTED SO I COULD MOVE IT. A GUY LOOKED AT IT FOR A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE HE GOT IT STARTED. I WAS THRILLED. THAT'S WHEN I KNEW IT WASN'T THE FUEL PUMP THAT WENT OUT. TO GET IT STARTED WE HAD TO HOOK THE FUEL PUMP UP WITH A DIFFERENT WIRE THAT IS RAN TO ONE OF THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER SPOTS IN THE VAN. THAT WAS IN SEPTEMBER. THAT'S HOW I'VE BEEN DRIVING MY VAN SINCE. NOW THE OTHER DAY AS I DROVE OVER A BRIDGE MY VAN JUST DIED. REASON IS BECAUSE THE WIRE THAT IS PLUGGED INTO CIGARETTE LIGHTER TO FUEL PUMP GOT TO HOT AND BEGAN MELTING INSIDE THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER PLUGIN. THE WIRES BEGAN TO MELT AS WELL FROM BEING TO HOT. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AS IT CAN START A FIRE IN SOMEONES VEHICLE. SOMEONE CAN BE KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS AND IT CAN BE PREVENTED IF DODGE FIXED ALL THE VEHICLES WITH THIS SAME TIPM INSTEAD OF JUST SOME OF THE VEHICLES THAT THE RECALL WAS FOR.",

MY DRIVER'S SIDE HEADREST DEPLOYED (SNAPPED INTO THE FORWARD POSITION) WHILE THE CAR WAS PARKED AND TURNED OFF.  I WAS PICKING UP A BAG FROM BEHIND THE DRIVER'S SEAT WHEN THIS HAPPENED.  IT WAS STARTLING TO SAY THE LEAST.  I WAS NOT HURT, BUT I HAVE READ THAT OTHERS WHO WERE ACTUALLY SITTING IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT HAVE BEEN HURT DUE TO THE HEADREST HITTING THEM IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD.  I LOOKED AT THE MECHANISM THAT RELEASES THE SPRING-LOADED HEADREST, AND IT WAS BROKEN.  SEVERAL PIECES OF BROKEN PLASTIC WERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HEADREST BOX, AND A METAL BAR THAT SERVES TO HOLD THE HEADREST IN THE NORMAL POSITION WAS AT AN ANGLE WITH BROKEN PLASTIC AROUND IT.  IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT THE PLASTIC RETAINED THE METAL BAR, AND THIS PLASTIC SIMPLY BROKE AND RELEASED THE HEADREST TO SPRING FORWARD.  IN MY ESTIMATION, THE PLASTIC HOLDING THE BAR WAS INSUFFICIENT IN STRENGTH TO SERVE ITS FUNCTION RELIABLY LONG-TERM.  IT'S A BAD DESIGN.  FORUMS ON THE INTERNET CONFIRM THAT THIS FAILURE IS NOT INFREQUENT AND SOMETIMES HARMFUL TO THE PERSON IN THE SEAT.  THE COST OF REPLACEMENT OF THE HEADREST IS ABOUT $700.  I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT THE REPAIR WOULD TAKE AN EXPERIENCED TECHNICIAN ABOUT 15 MINUTES, SO THE HEADREST MUST BE QUITE PRICEY.  SINCE THE HEADREST IS FUNCTIONALLY IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS AN AIRBAG, AND SINCE IT CAN CAUSE PHYSICAL HARM WHEN IT SUDDENLY BREAKS FOR NO CAUSE OTHER THEN DESIGN FAILURE, I BELIEVE THAT THE HEADREST SHOULD BE RECALLED.  CONSUMERS SHOULD NOT BEAR THE BURDEN OF REPAIRING A FAULTY DESIGN IN A SAFETY SYSTEM.",

SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE HAD OVER 10 BRAKE DOWNS THAT OCCURED INTERMITTENTLY WITHOUT ANY SORT OF PATTERN TO THE FREQUENCY OR SERVERITY.  MY CAR STALLED WITHOUT WARNING AND SHUT DOWN WHILE IN MOTION.  MY CAR LOSS POWER AND BECAME HARD TO STEER AND THE BRAKE ASSIST SHUT DOWN.  THERE WERE NO WARNING LIGHTS, SOUNDS, OR VISUAL CUES TO INDICATE ANY SORT OF PROBLEMS.  BECAUSE OF THIS SUDDEN SHUT DOWN IT HAS BECOME EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND ALARMING TO THE SAFETY OF MYSELF AND FAMILY TO DRIVE.  AFTER THE FIRST TWO INCIDENTS  I TOOK MY CAR TO THE CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP,  AND PAID FOR A DIAGNOSTIC TEST.  THEY  CONCLULED THAT THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE STALLING CONDITIONS AND THEREFORE NO RESOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM WAS GIVEN.  AFTER THE PROBLEM CONTINUED I TOOK MY CAR TO ANOTHER LOCAL REPAIR SHOP. THEY ADVISE ME OF SEVERAL POSSIBLE PROBLEMS BASED ON THE CHECK ENGINE CODE.   I HAVE SPENT COUNTLESS OF HOURS AND MONEY TO FIND OUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY VAN. I HAVE BEEN GIVEN VARIOUS RECOMMENDATION: REPLACING THERMOSTATE,  GASKETS AND COOLANT TEMP SENSOR, ERG VALVE REPLACEMENT,  BAD ICM, BAD ESC MODULE, BAD KEY FOB, BAD IGNITION NODE, CRANK SENSORS, MODULE COIL PACK, TIPM REPLACEMENT AND THE LIST GO ON AND ON.    TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM, I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT CHRYSLER CORPORATION PIN POINT THE PROBLEM AND PROVIDE A REPAIR OPTION THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE ME TO REPLACE EVERY SINGLE PART OF MY VEHICLE TO BE ABLE TO SAFELY DRIVE AGAIN.   I NEED TO KNOW WHAT PRE-EXISTING PROBLEMS THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT HAS CAUSED THE 2013 CHRYSLER TOWN AND COUNTRY TO STALL RANDOMLY AND TO START BACK UP AFTER 30 MINUTES. I HAVE CONTACTED CHRYSLER AND WAS PROVIDED A CASE NUMBER.",

I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THE CAR AGAIN EVEN AFTER WE FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON AND FIX IT. THANK GOODNESS IT NEVER 'STALLED' WHEN I WAS ON A MAJOR ROAD/FREEWAY WITH MY 3 KIDS. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNSAFE AND NEEDS A RECALL AND TO BE FIXED! I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY $1,200+ BECAUSE OF A FAULTY PART MY CAR WAS BUILT WITH!",

ON 10/10/17, JUST 11 DAYS LATER, WHILE DRIVING 55 MPH ON A SMOOTH, CLEAR HIGHWAY, THE FRONT RIGHT TIRE BLEW UP, CAUSING A HORRIFIC CRASH. THERE WAS A LOUD EXPLOSION, THE CAR VEERED OUT OF CONTROL, MY HUSBAND FOUGHT THE WHEEL AS IT SKIDDED ALONG THE GRAVEL VERGE. WE WERE ON 2 WHEELS, ABOUT TO FLIP, WHEN WE HIT A PAVED DRIVEWAY, WHICH SWUNG THE VAN AROUND FULL FORCE DOWN A DITCH INTO A PINE GROVE. AIRBAGS DEPLOYED, WE SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES (ALTHOUGH IT TURNS OUT THEY AREN'T SO MINOR AFTER ALL) THANKS TO SAFETY CONSTRUCTION IN THE CAR AND OUR SEAT BELTS. THE VAN WAS TOTALED. WITNESSES, THE SHERIFF, THE WRECKER DRIVERS (IT TOOK 2), AND (LATER) OUR MECHANIC AGREED THAT THE FRONT RIGHT TIRE HAD SEPARATED FROM THE RIM SUDDENLY, (HENCE THE EXPLOSION SOUND) AND WAS CLEARLY THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT. WE WERE 200 MILES FROM HOME AND NEEDED A HOTEL, HOSPITAL VISITS, AND A NEW CAR.  RESIDUAL INJURIES ARE MINOR BUT IMPAIR OUR DAILY LIVES: WRENCHED SHOULDERS, PERSISTENT BRUISING, PTSD, AND THE TIME AND COST OF BORROWING MONEY TO GET A REPLACEMENT CAR. ATTORNEYS AREN'T INTERESTED IN THE CASE BECAUSE OUR INJURIES AREN'T PROFITABLE ENOUGH FOR THEM, BUT THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE THE PRODUCT FAILED, AND OUR LIVES THREATENED. IF WE HADN'T HIT THAT DRIVEWAY, OR SEAT BELTS AND STRUCTURAL PROTECTIONS, WE'D HAVE ROLLED AND DIED. THE TIRE WAS CLEARLY THE CAUSE.

EVENTUALLY IT WOULD START AT SOME POINT AFTER I STOPPED TRYING AND LET IT SIT FOR AWHILE.  MY VEHICLE THEN SHUT DOWN TWICE WHILE DRIVING AT ABOUT 45 MILES AND HOUR, BUT IT STARTED UP.  I TOOK IT TO PEP BOYS TO GET DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND WAS TOLD THE TPIM MODULE IS GOING BAD AND THIS WOULD COST OVER $1400 TO REPAIR. I WAS TOTALLY SHOCKED BY HOW MANY COMPLAINTS I HAVE READ ONLINE ABOUT THE TOWN AND COUNTRY AS WELL AS OTHER CHRYSLERS AND DODGES HAVING THIS PROBLEM, BUT MORE SHOCKED AT THE FACT THAT THIS PROBLEM ISN'T BEING RECALLED IN THE TOWN AND COUNTRY.  THIS IS DANGEROUS AND REALLY MAKES ME NEVER WANT TO BUY ANOTHER CHRYSLER AGAIN.  IT REALLY SUCKS BECAUSE THIS REPAIR IS MUCH TOO COSTLY FOR AN AMERICAN MADE CAR.

THE MECHANICS AT LINWOOD MOTORS CLAIM TO HAVE REPLACED THE EXHAUST SYSTEM TWICE, BUT IT STILL LEAKS.  ON JULY 14, 2014 FOUND EXHAUST LEAKING INTO A/C VENTS & BLOWING INTO CAB. TECH REPLACED ENTIRE EXHAUST SYSTEM.  TEST DROVE WITH CARBON DIOXIDE MONITOR FROM WALMART, WHICH WILL ONLY DETECT AT 30 PPM'S OR HIGHER.  IF THE MONITOR HAD INDICATED THAT THERE WAS CARBON MONOXIDE IN THE CAB; A PERSON COULD ONLY BE EXPOSED TO HIS LEVEL FOR ONE HOUR BEFORE NEEDING TO BE REMOVED TO FRESH AIR!  WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO US, IT STILL WAS LEAKING EXHAUST FUMES INTO THE CAB.  WE MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO PUT THE VEHICLE BACK INTO THE SHOP AT LINWOOD MOTORS ON SEPTEMBER 8, 2014 AT 2 PM.  WHEN MY WIFE AND I ARRIVED AT LINWOOD MOTORS RICK KUPPER AND KEVIN JONES REFUSED TO PUT THE 2013 CHRYSLER T&C INTO THE MAINTENANCE  SHOP BECAUSE THEY HAD EXPENDED ALL THE RESOURCES THE COMPANY WOULD ALLOW.  AFTER THE 2013 CHRYSLER T&C  HAS SET IN MY YARD FOR 16 MONTHS CHRYSLER HAS FINALLY AGREED TO SETTLE AND BUYBACK THE VEHICLE.  MY NEW CONCERN IS THAT CHRYSLER WILL PUT THE VEHICLE BACK ON THE MARKET AND SALE IT WITHOUT FIXING THE 2013 CHRYSLER T&C.  MY WIFE HAD A STROKE ON JUNE 20, 2014 AND OUR DOCTORS ADVISED US TO QUIT DRIVING THE 2013 CHRYSLER T&C; BECAUSE MY WIFE'S DOCTOR BELIEVES THE EXHAUST LEAK CONTRIBUTED TO HER STROKE.  I HAD TO PURCHASE ANOTHER VEHICLE TO DRIVE AND LOST INTEREST ON MY MONEY THAT I HAD TO USE FROM SAVINGS.  CHRYSLER HAS MADE A  BELIER OUT OF ME!!!

WE WENT ON OUR WAY FOR A WHILE, AND HAD TO STOP FOR GAS. WHEN WE TRIED TO START THE ENGINE, NOTHING HAPPENED. IT WAS DEAD, LONG STORY SHORT, WE CALLED A WRECKER AND HAD IT TOWED TO A LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALER AND HAD TO RENT A CAR TO GET BACK HOME. WE CALLED THE DEALER A FEW DAYS LATER AND IT TURNS OUT THE PROBLEM IS THE TIPM DEVICE WHICH IS THE COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT EFFECTS THE WHOLE VEHICLE. THE DEALER HAS HAD THE VAN FOR 3 WEEKS NOW, WAITING FOR THE PART TO ARRIVE. AFTER EXTENSIVE RESEARCH, I HAVE DISCOVERED THERE IS A NATIONAL BACKORDER FOR THIS PARTICULAR PART, AND THERE IS ACTUALLY A CLASS ACTION SUITE AGAINST CHRYSLER FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM. I'M JUST CURIOUS TO KNOW WHY, IF THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM, WHY ARE THEY STILL INSTALLING THESE DEVICES KNOWING THEY MAY ULTIMATELY FAIL. AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING, I AM A DISABLED DRIVER, NOW WITHOUT MY WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE VAN. SO I AM HAVING TO DEPEND ON MY ELDERLY FATHER TO GET ME TO AND FROM WORK.

GIVEN MY EXPERIENCE I BELIEVE THE PRACTICE OF BINDING ALL THE KEYS AND OTHER PLASTIC DOO-DAHS WITH A STIFF WIRE CABLE TO BE AN ACCIDENT IN THE WAITING. IN MY CASE  THE SEAT WAS A LITTLE FORWARD AND I MOVED IT BACK A COUPLE OF INCHES TO AVOID HAVING THE KEYS DANCE ON MY KNEE AS WE DROVE. AT A STOP I CUT THE WIRE RING AND PUT ALL THE EXTRAS IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT AND CONTINUED THE TRIP WITH A SINGLE FOB-KEY.     THE KEYS: I WAS GIVEN SET OF KEYS BOUND BY A WIRE CABLE. TWO FOBS, TWO SPARE KEYS (NORMALLY INSERTED IN THE FOBS) , THREE PLASTIC ADD-ONS (ONE HELD A PAPER SLIP IDENTIFYING THE VEHICLE, ONE AVIS CALL NUMBER AND ONE MACYS LOYALTY CARD)    I HAVE NO ISSUES WITH THE VEHICLE AS IT WORKED FINE, NOR WITH THE RENTAL COMPANY AS THEIR SERVICE WAS ALSO FINE.  I DO TAKE ISSUE WITH THE PRACTICE OF BINDING THE KEYS WITH A WIRE CABLE THAT MUST BE CUT (LEATHER-MAN TOOL IN MY CASE)  TO DRIVE SAFELY. I SUSPECT MOST RENTERS WILL NOT HAVE A TOOL HANDY NOR RISK THE WRATH OF THE RENTER IN CUTTING THE WIRE CABLE. NOTE I TOOK A FEW PICTURES OF THE KEY RING AND OBJECTS SHOULD IT BE USEFUL.  TO AVIS CREDIT THEY WERE HAPPY TO HAVE ALL THE KEYS RETURNED AND WERE NOT CONCERNED I'D CUT THE CABLE.  *TR",
