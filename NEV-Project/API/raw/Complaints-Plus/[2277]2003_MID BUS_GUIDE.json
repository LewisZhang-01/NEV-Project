        "summary": "WE RECEIVED 9 RECALL LETTERS ON JANUARY 14, 2004 THAT WOULD AFFECT 9 OF OUR 2003 MID-BUSES.  IT STATED THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL JOINT STRENGTH SEAMS IN MID BUS PRODUCTION OF SCHOOL BUSES THAT MAY NOT MEET THE MINIMUM JOINT STRENGTH NEEDED IN A SCHOOL BUS.  WHAT THAT MEANS THAT, IF THE BUS WERE TO BE IN AN ACCIDENT AND ROLL OVER, THE SEAMS MAY NOT HOLD AND THE BUS WOULD COME APART.  WE IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED OUR DEALER TO HAVE THE BUSES REPAIRED AND WERE TOLD THAT THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL MARCH, 2004.  I CALLED THEM AGAIN IN MARCH AND WAS TOLD THAT THE PARTS WOULD NOT BE THERE UNTIL MAY AND THAT WE MAY HAVE TO DRIVE THEM TO PHOENIX TO HAVE THEM REPAIRED.  WE PURCHASED THE BUSES THROUGH I-10 INT'L, 2802 N. FLOWING WELLS RD., TUCSON, AZ, 85705.  THE LETTER ALSO STATED THAT THE PROJECTED TIME FOR THE SERVICE AND REPAIRS WOULD BE 4 HOURS.  I-10 REPAIRED 4 OF OUR BUSES IN JULY, 2004, 7 MONTHS AFTER THE RECALL, BUT NOW REFUSE TO TOUCH THE OTHER 5 BECAUSE IT WAS ACTUALLY TAKING THEM 11 HOURS TO REPAIR THEM, OR 7 HOURS THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE PAID FOR.  WE ARE CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE.  WE JUST WANT TO HAVE OUR BUSES REPAIRED LIKE THEY SHOULD BE.  CAN YOU HELP US?*AK",
