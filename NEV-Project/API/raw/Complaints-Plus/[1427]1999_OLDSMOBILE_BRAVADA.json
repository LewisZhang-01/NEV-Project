WHEN SHE WAS DONE, SHE GRASPED THE HANDLE ON THE REAR GLASS AND STARTED TO PULL DOWN TO CLOSE IT. IT IMMEDIATELY SHATTERED ALL OVER HER. SHE RECEIVED TWO SMALL CUTS TO HER HANDS AND ONE SMALL CUT ON HER CHIN FROM FLYING GLASS.  AT THIS TIME, THERE APPEARS TO BE NO GLASS IN HER EYES. UPON MY LOOKING INTO WHY THIS HAPPENED, I FOUND THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR HATCH HINGE PIN WAS LYING IN A RECESSED CHANNEL ON THE TOP OF THE CAR. THE \"E\" CLIP RETAINER WAS MISSING AND THE PIN HAD FALLEN OUT. THIS OBVIOUSLY ALLOWED THE GLASS TO TWIST AND SHATTER. WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT AT  THE DEALER IN THE MORNING AND WILL EXPLAIN THIS SAME STORY. TO SAY I'M FURIOUS IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. IN MY OPINION, THE HINGE PIN RETENTION SYSTEM IS NOT POSITIVE ENOUGH. THE \"E\" CLIP RETAINER CAN EASILY POP OFF OF THE PIN. I'M A MAINTENANCE TECHNICIAN AND I HAVE ALREADY THOUGH OF 3 BETTER WAYS TO RETAIN THE PIN.
