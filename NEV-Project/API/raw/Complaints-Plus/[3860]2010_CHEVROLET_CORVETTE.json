THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY UNSAFE AT ANY SPEED WHEN THERE IS WATER ON THE ROAD.  I HAVE APPROACHED THE DEALER AND CHEVROLET ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS AS TO WHAT I CAN DO TO REMEDY THIS SITUATION AND HAVE BEEN STONEWALLED AT EVERY STEP.  I HAVE TALKED TO OTHER OWNERS AND MANY OF THEM HAVE SWAPPED OUT THE STANDARD ISSUE GOODYEARS FOR MICHELINS AT A COST OF AROUND $2000 AND THAT SEEMS TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  I WAS NOT ABLE TO GET MY DEALER OR CHEVROLET TO CONFIRM THIS.   THEIR ANSWER IS TO REPLACE THEM WITH THE SAME TIRE THAT CAME WITH THE VEHICLE.  MY CAR IS NEARLY TWO YEARS OLD AND HAS LESS THAN 5000 MILES ON IT, SO TIRE WEAR IS NOT THE ISSUE.  THE Z06 AND ZR1 MODELS COME STANDARD WITH MICHELINS AND I THINK THE GRAND SPORT SHOULD AS WELL.
