ALSO, I HAVE RECEIVED SEVERAL SUZUKI RECALLS HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO SUZUKI SERVICE CENTERS IN AMERICA NOW TO GET THESES ISSUES RESOLVED. THE LATEST RECALL WAS SENT TO ME FROM SUZUKI STATING THE ISSUE AND THAT THEY WOULD NOTIFY WHERE TO GET IT RESOLVED......SOON?? NEVER HEARD ANOTHER WORD!

MANY PEOPLE WOULD PANIC IN THAT SITUATION AND COULD VERY LIKELY HAVE A COLLISION.  AS SOON AS I DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM TO THE SERVICE MANAGER, HE IMMEDIATELY KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND HAD ME BRING IN THE VEHICLE FOR REPAIRS.    THE REPAIR MANAGER MENTIONED TO ME THAT HE HAD AT LEAST 20 FAILURES OF THAT COMPONENT OCCUR WITHIN THE PAST TWO YEARS.  I CALLED SUZUKI, BUT THEY WOULD NOT COVER THE REPAIR COST NOR EVEN GIVE THE SLIGHTEST HINT OF WANTING TO RECALL THAT MODEL & YEAR VEHICLE.  FYI, THE ORIGINAL TENSIONER CONSISTED OF A METAL PULLEY WHEEL WHICH HAD A PLASTIC ?U? SHAPED RIM MOLDED ONTO THE OUTSIDE OF THE PULLEY.  THE FUNCTION OF THE PLASTIC RIM IS TO HOLD THE POWER STEERING BELT IN PLACE.  THE FAILURES THAT HAVE OCCURRED ARE DUE TO THE PLASTIC RIM FALLING OFF OF THE PULLEY (DUE TO DETERIORATION OR FATIGUE), LOOSENING THE BELT AND THUS NO LONGER TURNING THE POWER STEERING PUMP.

THEREAFTER, APPROXIMATELY EVERY 4 TO 8 WEEKS, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON - TO WHICH THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT FAULKNER RESPONDED BY CHANGING THE OXYGEN SENSORS AND REPLACING THE ASSOCIATED COMPUTER. ALSO OF NOTE, THEIR WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE WHEELS ON THE CAR (WHICH IMPAIRED STEERING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS) TO WHICH THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED WITH HAVING ME PURCHASE NEW TIRES - THE CAR WAS 8 MONTHS OLD AT THIS POINT (THIS DID NOT FULLY RESOLVE THAT PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH IT DID IMPROVE SOMEWHAT).
