I BOUGHT THE FACTORY FORD EXTENDED WARRENTY AND HAVE HAD IT TO THE DEALER I BOUGHT THE TRUCK AT 3 TIMES THEY HAVE REPLACED MANY STEERING PARTS AND EVEN THE POWER STEERING PUMP TWICE. THE PROBLEM STILL EXSISTS SO I TOOK THE TRUCK TO ANOTHER DEALER SEVERAL MILES AWAY AND THEY KEPT THE TRUCK FOR A WEEK AND REPLACED STEERING PARTS AND DID AN ALLIGNMENT. THE PROBLEM STILL REMAINS AND I ASKED AT BOTH DEALERS IF THE STEERING BOX NEEDED OR WAS REPLACED AND WAS TOLD NO. THE PROBLEM IS STILL THERE AND NOW MY EXTENDED WARRENT I PURCHASED HAS RUN OUT AND I'M SEEKING ADVICE.",
