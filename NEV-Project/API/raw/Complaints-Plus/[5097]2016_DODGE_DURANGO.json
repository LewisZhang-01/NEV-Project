AFTER BACKING OUT, I PUT THE CAR IN PARK, UNBUCKLED MY SEATBELT AND OPENED THE DRIVER DOOR IN ORDER TO GO BACK INTO THE HOUSE.

AS SOON AS I REALIZED WHAT HAPPENED, I SLAMMED ON THE BREAK BUT UNFORTUNATELY I STILL HIT THE GARAGE (THE SINGLE CAR GARAGE). I WAS AT AN ANGLE TO THE BUILDING WHICH CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE FRONT LEFT OF THE VEHICLE BUT ALSO TO THE RIGHT SIDE PASSENGER DOOR AND ATTACHED MIRROR.  AS WELL AS SOME DAMAGE TO THE GARAGE ALSO.   THIS WAS A VERY SCARY SITUATION FOR ME BUT THERE'S MORE.  MY HUSBAND WAS TAKING OUT THE GARBAGE THAT MORNING AND WAS WALKING ACROSSED THE GARAGE TOWARD THE GARBAGE CAN.
