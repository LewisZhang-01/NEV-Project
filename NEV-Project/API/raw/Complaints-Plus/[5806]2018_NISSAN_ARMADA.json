DETAILS OF EACH VISIT ARE:  EVENT #1: 05/14/19 - A MECHANIC AT A SHOP NEAR TO WHERE THE PROBLEM HAPPENED CONNECTED A HAND-HELD DEVICE TO MY VEHICLE.THE DEVICE ISSUED A CODE. THE EASY FIX WAS TO RESET THE ENGINE, WHICH I AGREED-TO DO SINCE THE CAR WAS UNDRIVEABLE. THE FOLLOWING MORNING, I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO MN SERVICE. I DETAILED THE PROBLEM AND THE CODE GIVEN BY THE HAND-HELD DEVICE. MN WAS NOT ABLE TO ADDRESS AND FIX THE ISSUE. MN SUGGESTED THAT IF THE PROBLEM HAPPENED AGAIN TO DRIVE MY VEHICLE TO MN WITHOUT RESETTING SO THAT THEY COULD DIAGNOSE.   EVENT #2: 06/12/19 - SAME PROBLEM AGAIN (LOSS OF POWER, SPEED AND ACCELERATION). I DROVE THE CAR TO MN. PER MN, THE PROBLEM WAS A HARNESS THAT WAS REPLACED, AND THIS TOOK CARE OF THE PROBLEM.  EVENT #3: 08/12/19 - SAME PROBLEM AGAIN. I DROVE THE CAR TO MN. PER MN, THE PROBLEM THIS TIME WAS THE ECM COMPUTER THAT WAS REPLACED, AND THIS TOOK CARE OF THE PROBLEM.  EVENT #4: 12/2/19 - SAME PROBLEM AGAIN. I DROVE THE CAR TO MN. PER MN, THE PROBLEM THIS TIME WAS A MOTOR RELAY THAT WAS REPLACED, AND THIS TOOK CARE OF THE PROBLEM.
