At the same time, ABS, VTM-4, and stabilty warning lights came on.  I was in a construction zone with no place to stop, so I kept going.  The instabilty seemed manageable,  so I kept going to an exit.  On the ramp, while cornering even slightly, there was a rubbing sound from the rear wheel area.  In a straight line, it sounded okay, but didn't feel right.  When we were able to park and get out, the rear wheels were splayed out (extreme negative camber) as if the car was grossly overloaded, even though if was empty.    Upon inspection, I found that the two rear mounts for the subframe had completely pulled out of the unibody.  The subframe had rusted from the inside, so there was no appearance of structurally significant rust until it failed.  When the suspension subframe pulled away, it pulled apart the wiring for the ABS, etc.  This is a very unsafe condition that appeared with no warning.  A quick internet search shows that it's also quite common.",

IT WAS DARK WHEN WE RETURNED HOME AND THE HEADLIGHTS SEEMED VERY DIM WHEN USING LOW BEAMS. WE WERE IN A VERY RURAL AREA AND ABLE TO USE HIGH BEAMS FOR MOST OF THE TRIP. WHEN SWITCHING TO LOW BEAMS DUE TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC, I HAD DIFFICULTY SEEING THE ROAD. WHEN WE REACHED THE HIGHWAY AND HAD TO USE LOW BEAMS MORE, IT WAS OBVIOUS SOMETHING WAS WRONG. I USED HIGH BEAMS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. AT ONE POINT, I SWITCHED TO LOW BEAMS AS A CAR PASSED ME. THE LIGHTS WERE DIM AGAIN BUT SUDDENLY BRIGHTENED UP A SECOND AFTER SWITCHING TO LOW BEAMS (POSSIBLY DUE TO A BUMP IN THE ROAD?) AND I REALIZED WE HAD BEEN DRIVING WITH ONLY FOG LIGHTS FOR THE PAST 30 MINUTES. WITHOUT THE FOG LIGHTS, WE DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE CRASHED WHEN WE DIMMED OUR HIGH BEAMS ON THE RURAL ROADS EARLIER IN THE TRIP.    THE FOLLOWING DAY, I TURNED ON THE HEADLIGHTS AND THE LOW BEAMS WERE NOT WORKING. TAPPING ON THE LENS SOMETIMES TEMPORARILY FIXES THE PROBLEM, SO THE BURNING SMELL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN CONNECTED TO THE LOSS OF LIGHTS.     THE SUDDEN ONSET OF THIS PROBLEM IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD AND SEEMS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PROBLEM EXPERIENCED WITH HEADLIGHTS IN SEVERAL OTHER MODELS, INCLUDING 2003-2005 PILOTS.     THE PREVIOUS RECALL (NHTSA ACTION NUMBER : EA11012 NHTSA RECALL CAMPAIGN NUMBER : 12V136000) WAS SPECIFIC TO 2 BULB SYSTEMS. THE 2007 PILOT USES A 4 BULB SYSTEM, BUT THE PROBLEM SEEMS SIMILAR AND I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ANY TECHNICAL INFORMATION THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THE 4 BULB SYSTEM IS IMMUNE TO THE PROBLEM.

I'VE ACTUALLY HAD TO TURN ON THE OVERHEAD LIGHT TO SEE WHICH BUTTON TO PUSH. OBVIOUSLY, THIS TAKES MY ATTENTION FROM THE ROAD, CAUSING DISTRACTED DRIVING. I'VE RESEARCHED AND FOUND THAT THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH HONDA PILOTS. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH A WONDERFUL VEHICLE AND COMPANY WOULD HAVE SUB PAR PARTS OR A PROBLEM THAT CAUSES THIS TO HAPPEN. I'VE HAD OTHER CARS (MUCH OLDER MODELS) THAT HAVE NEVER HAD AN INTERIOR LIGHT GO OUT. I'D JUST LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE IS ANY WAY THAT I CAN REMEDY THIS SITUATION.

THE HONDA SERVICE TECHNICIAN HAD CALLED ME BACK A FEW HOURS LATER TO REPORT A HOLE ON MY CONDENSER THAT WAS NOT REPAIRABLE AND REQUIRED TO BE REPLACED. THIS REPAIR BY HONDA IS APPARENTLY NOT COVERED UNDER HONDA CARE WARRANTY. ON THE HONDA CARE WEBSITE, IT CLEARLY SHOWS THAT THE CONDENSER IS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY REPAIR. THERE IS NO \"FINE PRINT\" INDICATING OTHERWISE. HONDA CLAIMS THAT THE DAMAGE WAS DUE TO A \"FOREIGN OBJECT\" LIKE A ROCK OR PEBBLE WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THERE IS A SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW WITH THE VEHICLE. THE FRONT GRILL IS AN OPEN DESIGN THAT EXPOSES THE RADIATOR AND A/C CONDENSER UNIT. IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION, THERE IS THE STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT ANY \"FOREIGN OBJECT\" CAN HIT THAT ARE. HONDA HAD QUOTED ME AT $700+ DOLLARS ON THE COST OF THE REPAIR. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS THAT THE REPAIR COST MUST FALL ON THE CONSUMER TO PAY OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES ON A REPAIR THAT IS CLEARLY NOT AT FAULT OF ANY DRIVER AND IS DUE TO A DESIGN FLAW ON THE VEHICLE. I WOULD LIKE THE NHTSA TO INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER. I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH AND APPARENTLY THERE IS ALREADY A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT INVOLVING THE 2004-2007 HONDA ODYSSEY VEHICLE LINEUP THAT HAS A VERY SIMILAR ISSUE WITH AN OPEN FRONT GRILL DESIGN.  *TR",

        "summary": "I WAS LEAVING A PARKING LOT IN MY 2007 HONDA PILOT AND HAD BACKED OUT OF MY PARKING SPOT.  I WAS ABOUT TO TURN RIGHT ONTO A SIDE STREET AND WAS GOING TO MAKE A LEFT ON A MAJOR ROAD.  THERE WAS A RED LIGHT AT THE INTERSECTION.  AS I WAS PULLING OUT ONTO THE SIDE STREET, MY TIRE GOT STUCK ON THE CURB.  I LIGHTLY PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR TO GET OVER THE HUMP AND THE CAR SUDDENLY ACCELERATED.  AN EYE WITNESS SAID IT APPEARED THAT MY CAR ACCELERATED TO 30 OR 40 MPH IN JUST 2 OR 3 SECONDS.  I IMMEDIATELY LIFTED MY FOOT OFF THE ACCELERATOR AND TRIED TO APPLY THE BRAKE.  THE BRAKES DID NOT WORK.  THE CAR CONTINUED ACCELERATING EVEN THOUGH MY FOOT WAS NOT ON THE PEDAL.  THE ONLY CONTROL I HAD OVER THE CAR WAS THE STEERING WHEEL.   I WAS HEADED STRAIGHT FOR A TELEPHONE POLE AND LIGHT FIXTURE ACROSS THE STREET OPPOSITE THE PARKING LOT.  I BELIEVE I HIT THE TELEPHONE POLE AND LIGHT POLE SEVERAL TIMES AND THEN MY CAR SWUNG AROUND IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION I WAS ORIGINALLY HEADED.      THE IMPACT RESTORED MY CAR BACK TO NORMAL OPERATION.  THE BRAKES AND ACCELERATOR THEN RESUMED WORKING AGAIN.  THE FRONT BUMPER WAS RIPPED OFF MY CAR, THE FRONT OF THE CAR WAS BASHED IN BY THE PASSENGER SIDE, THE WINDSHIELD HAD A CRACK, RIGHT FRONT PASSENGER DOOR WAS NO LONGER ALIGNED AND COULD ONLY OPEN A FEW INCHES, THE MUD FLAP FOR THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE WAS RIPPED OFF, THE RIGHT SIDEVIEW MIRROR WAS RIPPED OFF, BOTH DOORS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WERE CRUSHED.  THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR COULD NOT BE OPENED.    THE AIRBAG DEPLOYED, SEATBELT LOCKED AND THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW COMPLETELY SHATTERED ON IMPACT.    THE EYE WITNESS WAS STOPPED AT THE INTERSECTION WAITING FOR THE LIGHT TO TURN GREEN.  HE SAID IT LOOKED LIKE A MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND WAS SHOCKED AT HOW QUICKLY THE CAR ACCELERATED.    IT APPEARS THAT GOING OVER THE BUMP AND LIGHTLY APPLYING THE GAS PEDAL AFTERWARDS TRIGGERED SOMETHING IN THE CAR. *TR",

I PREVIOUSLY HAD A 2003 TOYOTA HIGHLANDER 2WD, 4 CYL, WITH THE EXACT SAME CONFIGURATION.  SINCE I HAVE ADAPTED MY 2007 HONDA PILOT WITH THE EQUIPMENT, I HAVE FOUND THIS VEHICLE IS NOT CAPABLE OF CARRYING THE TONGUE WEIGHT LOAD OF ABOUT 350 LBS, WHICH HONDA  PUBLISHED IS ADEQUATE (I.E. HONDA STATES A 2WD PILOT IS CAPABLE OF TOWING 3,500 LBS AND A 4WD IS CAPABLE OF TOWING 4,500 LBS, WHICH EQUATES TO AN ALLOWABLE TONGUE WEIGHT OF 10% OF TOWING WEIGHT WHICH IS 350 LBS FOR THE 2WD AND 450 LBS FOR THE 4WD).  I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE CHIEF MECHANIC AT HOLLYWOOD HONDA;  THE HITCH EXPERTS; PROFESSIONALS AT MY WHEELCHAIR/LIFT FACILITY AND EVERYONE AGREEW  THE 2007 HONDA PILOT CAN NOT CARRY THE TONGUE WEIGHT OF 350 LBS IN A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE MANNER.  THE VEHICLE STARTS TO LOWER THE BACK END AND THE FRONT END STARTS TO LIFT UPWARDS AS THE WEIGHT OF THE WHEELCHAIR ON THE LIFT STARTS TO ASCEND.  WHEN THE BACK END OF THE HONDA PILOT HAS \"BOTTOMED OUT\", THEN THE WHEELCHAIR AND LIFT START TO ASCEND.  WHEN THE WHEELCHAIR AND LIFT ASCEND TO ITS PROPER HEIGHT AS DESIGNED BY THE LIFT MANUFACTURER, THE LIFT AND WHEELCHAIR ARE IN A VERY VULNERABLE POSITION WHICH IS NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO KEEP THE LIFT FROM BOTTOMING OUT AND THE ENTIRE WHEELCHAIR AND LIFT FROM \"BOUNCING\" IN MANNER WHICH IS UNCONTROLLABLE, WHCIH GIVES THE SENSATION OF BEING OUT OF CONTROL.  MEANWHILE, THE FRONT END OF THE HONDA PILOT HAS ESCALATED ABOUT 6 - 8 INCHES ABOVE ITS NORMAL LEVEL PLAIN.  IF HONDA HAS CONDUCTED ITS EVALUATIONS IN A SATISFACTORY AND SAFE MANNER AS THEY PUBLISH A 2WD HONDA PILOT CAN TOW 3,500 LBS AND A 4WD HONDA PILOT CAN TOW 4,500 LBS, THEN WHY CAN'T THE HONDA PILOT EFFECTIVELY MAINTAIN THE NORMAL TONGUE WEIGHT OF 10% OF THE TOWING WEIGHT WHICH THEY STIPULATE?  IF YOU CAN ASSIST ME IN MAKING SOME DETERMINATION PERTAINING TO THIS ISSUE, I WILL BE GRATEFULLY APPRECIATIVE.",
