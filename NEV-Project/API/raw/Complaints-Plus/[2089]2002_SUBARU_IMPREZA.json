Thankfully, I was in the far left lane which avoided me smashing into another car. After research, I found a recall that included my car's make, model, year, and VIN range but was not applied to my car due to it not being registered in a \"salt state\". Had this car been treated in the first place like other same model cars were, it would not have had this issue. The car was purchased and has been in the Northern Virginia area for its whole life. Virginia is not a salt state, however, this car has been in and out of WV, MD, PA & DC which are all salt states. This car was originally purchased in Alexandria, VA which borders Washington DC. The NHTSA Campaign Number is: 11V464000 (SUBARU\u2019S SAFETY RECALL NUMBER WVX-34). I reached out to Subaru Dealerships in my area which helped me open a case with Subaru of America. My case representative said that Subaru of America is not authorized to add vehicles to a recall and that only the NHTSA can do that. I emailed the NHTSA who then recommended that I submit a formal complaint with the NHTSA.",

I HAVE TRACKED THE LEAK DOWN TO A TWO-INCH RUBBER HOSE SECTION UNDER THE INTAKE MANIFOLD ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.

THEY FOUND THAT THE CAM POSITION SENSOR HAD MALFUNCTIONED AND CAUSED MY CAR TO MISSFIRE WHEN I WOULD HIT A BUMP IN THE ROAD. THEY REPLACED THE SENSOR AND CHARGED ME A FEE OF $800 DUE TO THE MASSIVE TROUBLESHOOTING WORK THAT LED UP TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM.  FINALLY THE PROBLEM THAT I HAD SINCE THE CAR WAS BRAND NEW WAS FIXED AT THE FULL COST TO ME.  AT 48000 MY TRANSMISSION WAS THE NEXT TO GO. I LOST THE ABILITY TO SHIFT MY CAR IN ANY GEAR. I HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP AS THE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY IS 60000 MILES. THEY DISMANTLED MY TRANSMISSION TO FIND 2ND GEAR STRIPPED. THEY THEN DENIED TO COVER THIS UNDER WARRANTY AS IT WAS LABELED ABUSE. THEY CHARGED ME $800 DOLLARS FOR THEIR TIME. THEN THEN GAVE ME A QUOTE FOR $4500 EXTRA DOLLARS TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION.  I HAD MY CAR TOWED TO THE SAME SHOP THAT FIXED MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT. THEY INSTALLED A NEW TRANSMISSION FOR ME AT THE COST OF $2200.  MY TRANSMISSON HAS ALSO BROKE AGAIN AT 65000 MILES.

ABS PERFORMANCE IS AS EXPECTED IN BOTH WET AND DRY PROVIDED THAT THE ROAD SURFACE WAS PERFECTLY SMOOTH.

AGAIN, THIS IS CONSISTENT IN BOTH WET AND DRY CONDITIONS.   MY VEHICLE IS ENTIRELY STOCK AND HAS NOT BEEN RACED OFF ROAD, RALLIED OR AUTOCROSSED, ALL OF WHICH INCUR GREATER WEAR AND TEAR ON THE VEHICLE.
