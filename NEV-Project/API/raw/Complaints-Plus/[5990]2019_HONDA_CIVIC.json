Dealership inspected the system on April 1st, 2021 and found no issue. They told me to manually turn off the system every time I start the car.  4.

This condition was verified by the dealer on both occurrences. First occurrence was 6/8/21. It was towed to Spreen Honda dealer in Corona, CA. According to the the first invoice dated 6/8/21 for the repair there was \"Confirmed fault code for C1420 main torque sensor and sub torque sensor, C1421-14 malfunction to steering angle, confirmed multiple fault codes due to rodent damage to the steering system sub harness chewed thru replaced the steering torque sensor sub harness and calibrated the steering angle sensor, cleared fault code now OK.\" Same problem occurred 7/8/2021. Taken to Spreen Honda again on 7/9/21. Wire harness again replaced, steering angle sensor replaced and power steering calibration performed. I have the wire harness that was replaced. Service advisor stated this is a problem with Honda wire harnesses because the insulation on the wires is soy based. He has seen it many times, including one customer at Riverside dealer who had rodents eat his wire harness four times while he was working there.  Not having operational power steering makes driving the vehicle very difficult and potentially dangerous.",

I'M GOING ABOUT 10-15 MPH AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN MY AIRBAGS JUST GO OFF. NOTHING HIT, NO POTHOLE IN SIGHT, JUST SLOWLY DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND BAM.

SHE SAID THEY'LL LIFT IT AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR TO INDICATE THAT THE SENSOR WAS TOUCHED, IT'S INSTANTLY OUT OF WARRANTY AND I NEED TO GO THROUGH INSURANCE.
