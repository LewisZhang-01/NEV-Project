THE INTERLOCK IS INTENDED TO PREVENT REMOVAL OF  THE  IGNITION KEY UNLESS THE SHIFT LEVER IS PLACED IN THE \"PARK\" POSITION.

THE RECALL INVOLVES APPROXIMATELY 486,000 AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION EQUIPPED  VEHICLES - MANUAL TRANSMISSION EQUIPPED VEHICLES ARE NOT AFFECTED. INCLUDED  IN  THE RECALL ARE CERTAIN 1999 TO 2002 HONDA ACCORD MODELS AND ALL 1997 TO  2001  PRELUDE MODELS. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE RECALL ARE CERTAIN 1999 TO 2000 ACURA  TL  SEDANS.  AMERICAN HONDA WILL CONTACT OWNERS OF AFFECTED VEHICLES WHEN PARTS ARE  AVAILABLE AND ASK THEM TO TAKE THEIR VEHICLE TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALER TO BE  REPAIRED FREE OF CHARGE.

DETAILS REGARDING MAILING DATES AND AFFECTED VEHICLES WILL BE AVAILABLE ON  THE  HONDA AND ACURA WEB SITES ON FEBRUARY 4, 2005.

AFTER HITTING THE PARKED CAR, I TRIED TO PULL THE CAR FORWARD AND TRIED TO STOP. INSTEAD, IT STARTED MOVING FORWARD UNCONTROLLABLY, EVEN THOUGH I WAS PUSHING ON THE BRAKE PEDAL.  I LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE TO STOP.  IT TOOK CONTROL AND STARTED MOVING FORWARD THROUGH ROAD, DRIVEWAY AND NEIGHBORING LAWN.  I STEERED FOR ABOUT 100 FEET AND HIT THE CORNER OF THE NEIGHBORING HOME AND FINALLY STOPPED.  IT WAS FOR ABOUT 5 SECONDS OF FRIGHTENING MOMENT THAT MY FAMILY AND I WENT THROUGH.  IT WAS SUNNY AND 85 DEG F.  THE CAR HAD SEVERE DAMAGES ON BACK AND FRONT BUMPERS.  TIRE MARKS ON THE ROAD, DRIVEWAY, AND LAWN, PLUS PROPERTY DAMAGE TO THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE WERE SUSTAINED.  FRONT AIRBAGS DEPLOYED AND HIT MY WIFE AND I IN THE FACE.  I AM WONDERING IF THERE ARE ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS BY NHTSA ON SIMILAR INCIDENTS. PLEASE ADVISE.  *TR",

IN AUGUST OF 2011 AT 133000 MILES, MY VEHICLE SUDDENLY STARTED STUTTERING AND HESITATING WHEN UP SHIFTING FROM FIRST GEAR.  THE VEHICLE WOULD ALSO LURCH FORWARD DUE TO UNEXPECTED DOWN SHIFTS AT MODERATE SPEED.  DEPENDING ON THE TRAFFIC AND DRIVING CONDITIONS THIS COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A COLLISION, LUCKILY IN MY CASE IT DID NOT.  HOWEVER, OTHER OWNERS IMPACTED BY CAMPAIGN 04V176000 MAY NOT BE AS LUCKY SINCE IT IS LIKELY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEIR TRANSMISSION EVENTUALLY FAILS FOR THE SAME SAFETY ISSUES RAISED IN 2004.  *TR",

RESULTING  IN THE CAR ROLLING INTO THE CLOSED GARAGE DOOR, CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE BUMPER AND GARAGE DOOR.   PRIOR TO THIS THE CAR HAD ROLLED IN A PARKING LOT WITH THE DOORS LOCKED.  LUCKILY IT WAS NOT ON INCLINE AND I WAS ABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR AND BRAKE.  THIS PROBLEM CONTINUES TO DATE.  ON INVESTIGATION I FOUND THIS MODEL HAD A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM.  I CALLED ACURA AND THEY APOLOGIZED, STATING IT WAS NOT IN THE RECALL VIN #.  I TOOK THE CAR TO AN   ACURA DEALER, WHO VERIFIED THE PROBLEM, CALLED ACURA, WHO AGAIN STOOD BY THEIR ORIGINAL DECISION..NOT IN RECALL VIN #.  THE PROBLEM REMAINS.  I AM EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN PARKING TO DOUBLE CHECK THE CAR IS IN PARK, AND BRAKE ON.  LUCKILY I HAVE NOT CAUSED INJURY TO PROPERTY OR PERSON, HOWEVER ONLY TO MYSELF TRYING TO UNLOCK A ROLLING CAR AND \"JUMP\" IN TO STOP IT.    FOLLOWING ANOTHER \"ROLL AWAY\" I CALLED ACURA TODAY...THEY STAND BY THEIR ORIGINAL DECISION.  THIS CAR MAY NOT BE IN THEIR RECALL VIN #, HOWEVER, I CANNOT SELL THIS AUTO  NOR TRADE IT IN KNOWING IT MAY CAUSE A SERIOUS INJURY TO SOMEONE OR SOMETHING. I FEEL ACURA SHOULD HAVE CORRECTED THE PROBLEM WITH THE INITIAL COMPLAINT, KNOWING THERE WAS A RECALL.  WHY DO I SHUT THE CAR OFF IN N.  THE TRANSMISSION CAN BE USED MANUALLY OR AUTOMATIC.  WHEN IN AUTOMATIC POSITION, AND SHIFTED UP TO PARK POSITION, IT WILL STOP AT NEUTRAL, NEEDING TO BE PUSHED TO R AND UP TO PARK.  HABIT, BE IT BAD, IS WHEN THE SHIFTER STOPS IT IS GENERALLY IN PARK. I FEEL THIS PROBLEM IS ACURA'S, AND WOULD APPRECIATE ANY ASSISTANCE YOU CAN PROVIDE.  YESTERDAY I READ HONDA IS NOW BEING RECALLED FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.  THANKYOU. *TR",

MY 2 PREVIOUS ACURAS WERE GREAT, BOTH HAD IN EXCESS OF 200K BEFORE I TRADED THEM IN AND HAD NO PROBLEM WITH THE TRANMISSION WHATSOEVER.  BECAUSE OF COMPANY'S FIRST FAILED ATTEMPT AT MAKING A 5 SPEED TIPTRONIC TRANMISSION IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE COMPANY SHOULD ACT IRRESPONSIBLE AND ENDANGER ITS CUSTOMERS' LIVES IN THE PROCESS.      WITHOUT PRIOR WARNING, THE TRANMISSION IN MY VEHICLE GOT LOCKED UP FOR A GOOD 2 TO 3 SECONDS SEVERAL TIMES WHILE I WAS DRIVING.  IT FELT LIKE I HIT THE BRAKE REALLY HARD WHEN IT WENT INTO LOCKUP, AND I WAS ALMOST HIT FROM BEHIND SEVERAL TIMES.  IN ADDITION, HAD IT BEEN RAINING AND THE SURFACE WAS SLIPPERY, I WOULD HAVE HYDROPLANED AND CRASHED MY CAR.    AND YET AFTER EXPLAINING THE SITUATIONS TO AN AGENT AT AN ACURA DEALERSHIP, AND BEAR IN MIND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A RECALL ISSUED IN ADDITION TO THE EXTENDED WARRANTY, HE STILL REPLIED THAT MY TRANNY IS NOT COVERED BY EITHER ONE.  BASICALLY, THE RECALL EFFORT WAS JUST A PUBLICITY STUNT THAT THE COMPANY ORCHESTRATED IN HOPE OF KEEPING THE CORPORATE IMAGE.

WHEN THIS HAPPENED BETWEEN 2ND AND 3RD GEARS, THE CAR WOULD JERK SEVERLY AND WOULD ONLY STOP IF I EITHER BRAKED OR PRESSED ON THE GAS.

THEY CONFIRMED THAT MY TRANSMISSION WAS FAILING (ONLY 4 MONTHS AFTER I HAD BOUGHT THE CAR AND WITH 92,000 MILES ON IT) AND THAT IT WOULD BE REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY ALONG WITH AN \"AXLE STUCK IN THE TRANSMISSION\". THEY HAVE FIXED THE PROBLEM, HOWEVER, MY NEW TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN IN MY CAR FOR ABOUT A WEEK NOW (ONLY 500 MILES ON IT, IT'S ONLY WARRANTIED FOR 12,000) AND IT IS ALREADY SHOWING SIGNS OF FAILING - PAUSE WHEN SHIFTING FROM REVERSE TO DRIVE, AND THE TRANSMISSION ALSO DOWNSHIFTS INTO A LOWER GEAR (EVEN IF IT DOESN'T NEED TO) AS SOON AS I TAKE MY FOOT OFF OF THE GAS PEDAL. MY NEW TRANSMISSION HAS ALSO MADE MY CAR ALOT SLOWER THAN IT WAS WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT. I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR, I DON'T FEEL SAFE IN IT BECAUSE OF MY PREVIOUS TRANSMISSION MALFUNCTION AND MY BEGINNING PROBLEMS WITH MY BRAND-NEW ONE. I WOULD HAVE NOT BOUGHT THIS CAR IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS, AND I WOULD HAVE NOT KNOWN ABOUT THEM IF IT WEREN'T FOR AN ONLINE FORUM FOR TL OWNERS. ACURA DID NOT SEND ME ANY TYPE OF NOTIFICATION ABOUT THEIR TRANSMISSION INSPECTION BEFORE MY TRANSMISSION FAILED.

A SHORT WAS FOUND IN THE WIREHOOK (FALSE CODE).      THE 2ND ATTEMPT TO REPAIR CHECK ENGINE LIGHT (DEC 13 2000) WAS A CODE P0305 #5 CYLINDER MISS FIRE AND THEY REPLACED 5 INJECTOR WITH 4 INJECTOR    THE THIRD ATTEMPT TO REPAIR CHECK ENGINE LIGHT (DEC 5 2001) WAS THE REPLACEMENT OF A LINEAR SOLENOID, GASKET AND O-RING.    THE FOURTH ATTEMPT TO REPAIR CHECK ENGINE LIGHT (NOV 14 2002) INJECTOR #4 WAS MISS FIRING. FUEL CLEANING AND ERG VALVE REPLACEMENT.  CLEARED ALL CODES AND LIGHT WENT OFF UNTIL I DROVE IT HOME AND THE LIGHT CAME BACK ON.    THE FIFTH ATTEMPT TO REPAIR CHECK ENGINE LIGHT (NOV 27, 2002) FOUND RECURRING CODES P-304 AND P-306.  REPAIRED ALL IGNITION COILS AND SPARK PLUGS.  UPDATED INJECTOR HARNESS \"BUSS\" CONNECTORS.    THE SIXTH ATTEMPT (JULY 28, 2003) TO REPAIR CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND SRS LIGHT.  CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAUSE #P304 MISFIRE.  SRS LIGHT FOUND FAULTY OPDS UNIT.  ELECTRICAL RELATED.  ORDERED AND REPLACED NEW UNIT.    THE SEVENTH ATTEMPT WAS ANOTHER MIS-FIRE ON #4 AND 5 CYLINDERS.  I HAD FILED A BETTER BUSINESS BUREA CLAIM (BETWEEN 6TH AND 7TH ATTEMPT) AND JUST SO HAPPENED THE DISTRICT MGR FOUND OUT ABOUT MY CLAIM WHEN MY CAR WAS AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE 7TH ATTEMPT REPAIR.  HE GAVE ORDERS TO STOP ALL REPAIRS ON THE CAR BECAUSE OF THE BBB CLAIM.    I AM NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF HONDA MEDIATION AND BBB.  I MAY BE OFFERED TRADE ASSISTANCE FROM THE MANUFACTURER OR VALUE PRICE FROM MANUFACTURER VIA BBB.  THE CAR IS UNFIXABLE AND DEEMED A \"LEMON\".
