I WAS DRIVING THIS CAR ON THE 401 EAST HIGHWAY, ONTARIO, CANADA ON 16TH DECEMBER 2007 AT 2.35 P.M. MY WIFE AND MY LITTLE ONE AND A HALF YEAR DAUGHTER WERE ALSO ACCOMPANYING ME. I WAS COMING FROM WINDSOR AND HEADING TOWARDS TORONTO.  SUDDENLY THE AIR BAG OF THE DRIVER SEAT BLEW UP WITHOUT ANY COLLISION OF MY CAR WITH ANY THING. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH THAT I WAS DRIVING IN THE RIGHT LANE AND MANAGED TO BRING MY CAR OUT OF THE DRIVING LANE. DUE TO ALMIGHTY'S GRACE NO CAR WAS FOLLOWING ME OTHERWISE THAT WOULD HAVE LEAD TO A DISASTER.   I WAS AMAZED TO SEE THIS IN FRONT OF MY EYES THAT HOW COULD AIRBAG OF THE CAR BLEW UP WITHOUT ANY COLLISION. I AM CONFIDENT THAT THIS WOULD HAVE SURPRISED YOU TOO THAT HOW COULD YOU MANUFACTURE SUCH A DREADFUL VEHICLE IN WHICH THE PARTS ACTIVATE AT THE WRONG TIME AND COULD LEAD TO ACCIDENTS INSTEAD OF ACTIVATING FOR THE SAFETY OF PASSENGERS.  I AM THANKFUL TO 911 EMERGENCY THAT THEY CAME ON TIME AND TOOK US OUT OF THE SITUATION AND WE MANAGED TO REACH BACK HOME SAFELY.  I IMPRESS UPON YOU TO LOOK INTO THIS SERIOUS ISSUE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I AM ALSO INTERESTED TO BRING THIS ISSUE TO OTHER CAR MANUFACTURERS AND LEGAL DEPARTMENTS WHICH HAVE AUTHORIZED YOU TO MANUFACTURE CARS WITHOUT TAKING THESE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION AND THE PASSENGERS HAVE TO PUT THERE LIVES ON RISK DUE TO YOUR SHEER NEGLIGENCE.  I WOULD LIKE YOU TO COMPENSATE ME FOR ALL THE HASSLES AND RISK OF LIFE MY FAMILY AND I HAVE BEEN THROUGH AND PROVIDE ME WITH OTHER CAR WHICH IS FULLY CHECKED.   I SPOKE WITH THE REPRESENTATIVE MS. MITCHEL AT THE HYUNDAI AMERICA NO. SHE HAS REGISTERED THIS SERIOUS ISSUE AND ASSIGNED CLAIM NO. 3182613.   I WOULD LIKE THIS MAIL TO BE FORWARDED TO THE CONCERNED PERSON AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO THAT THEY CAN LOOK INTO THIS MATTER SERIOUSLY.     THANKS AND REGARDS    RAJAN MALHOTRA  *TR",

I HAVE THE FEELING THAT THE DEALER WILL TRY NOT TO COVER THIS REPAIR. SEE MY DETAILS BELOW. RECALL CAMPAIGN:  00V314001. SHOULD THE DEALER BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS REPAIR? THIS CAR IS IN PERFECT SHAPE DESPITE THE MILEAGE. IT HAS NEVER BEEN HIT, TOWED OR IMPROPERLY JACKED. I HAVE A 1997 ACCENT GT ( MFG 04/16/97). I WAS NOTIFIED BY MAIL SOME MONTHS BACK THAT THE GAS CAP NEEDED TO BE REPLACED TO PREVENT EXCESS PRESSURE BUILDUP IN THE TANK THAT MIGHT LEAD TO THE TANK CRACKING. I WENT TO THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP, EARNHARDT HYUNDAI IN GILBERT, AZ, AND THEY REPLACED THE CAP AS SPECIFIED AND SUPPOSEDLY PRESSURE TESTED THE TANK. NOT LONG AFTER THAT I BEGAN TO SMELL FUMES WHENEVER I FILLED UP AND THE SMELL CONTINUED FOR 50 TO 75 MILES BEFORE ABATING. I DROPPED THE TANK AND CHECKED EVERYTHING I COULD FIND, REINSTALLED, AND STILL HAD THE PROBLEM. TODAY I DROPPED THE TANK AGAIN AND UPON CLOSE INSPECTION I FOUND A SMALL CRACK (ABOUT 1/2 INCH) IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TOP OF THE TANK. CLEARLY THE TANK NEEDS TO BE REPLACED BUT \"IS THERE IS AN IMPROVED TANK?\" AND \"WILL IT BE COVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE GAS CAP RECALL?\" SINCE CAUSE AND EFFECT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED. THE DEALERSHIP IS NOT COOPERATING WITH THIS REPAIR. IT IS MY COMPLAINT AND DEMAND THAT  HYUNDAI MUST PROVIDE FULL, PROMPT REMEDY FOR THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS (FLAMMABLE) DEFECT BUT HASN'T DONE SO. THIS CAR HAS 162,640 MILES (BUT RUNS LIKE NEW!). DON'T GET THIS WRONG, IT IS A GREAT CAR BUT HAS A SERIOUS DEFECT AND HYUNDAI IS NOT STEPPING UP TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE REPAIR WHICH THE DEALER ESTIMATES WILL COST APPROXIMATELY $350 TO FIX.

UPON TAKING THE CAR HOME WE FOUND THAT THE RENTAL CAR WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE DUE TO INOPERABLE SIDE MIRRORS, SO WE TOOK OUR OTHER CAR.  WE CALLED FROM NEW JERSEY ON MONDAY, BUT JASON WAS NOT IN AND NO ONE ELSE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE SITUATION AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD HAVE HIM CALL.  JASON CALLED THURSDAY TO INFORM US THAT THERE IS NO DEFECT AND THE PROBLEM IS NOT WARRANTEED.  HE ALSO SAID THAT WE MUST RETURN THE RENTAL CAR BECAUSE THE COST WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY THE DEALER SINCE IT IS NEITHER A DEFECT NOR UNDER WARRANTY.  JASON TOLD US TO REPLACE THE MOON ROOF THE JOB WOULD COST APPROX. $1500+, NOT INCLUDING SUBSEQUENT DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE.  WE THEN CALLED HYUNDAI MOTOR AMERICA CUSTOMER SERVICE, THE REP.
