I IMMEDIATELY CALLED FOR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE THROUGH MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND HAD THE CAR TAKEN TO MY MECHANIC. HE CALLED BACK THE FOLLOWING DAY WITH THE MOST DISHEARTENING NEWS. FOR SOME UNCANNY REASON, FLUID FROM THE RADIATOR WAS LEAKING INTO AND CONTAMINATING THE TRANSMISSION. HE VEHEMENTLY POINTED OUT THAT HE HAD SEEN QUITE A FEW OF THE SAME OMINOUS PROBLEMS BROUGHT TO HIS SHOP, INVOLVING MOSTLY 2006 NISSAN PATHFINDERS. I WAS GIVEN A QUOTE OF ABOUT $4500-$7000 TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM A USED CAR DEALER WITH APPROXIMATELY 117,000 MILES.  I'M CURRENTLY FINANCING THE CAR AND BECAUSE OF MY STUDENT LOAN AND EXORBITANT FEES, I STILL OWE A LOT ON IT. HONESTLY, I CANNOT&#8203; AFFORD THE REPAIRS AT THIS JUNCTURE.

I LIVE ON A REMOTE ISLAND IN SOUTHEAST ALASKA, SO THERE IS NO ACCESS TO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP. HIS SHOP COULD NOT FLUSH THE TRANSMISSION SO HAD ME CALL A SHOP OFF-ISLAND.

I DID CALL, RECEIVED A CASE NUMBER AND TODAY DURING A CONVERSATION WITH A REGIONAL CONSUMER AFFAIRS AGENT FOR NISSAN, WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT PERTAINING TO THIS VERY ISSUE BUT THAT I MISSED THE FILING DATE AND THEREFORE NISSAN COULD NOT HELP ME.      I CALLED NISSAN IN JUNE OF 2016 WITH AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION ISSUE THAT COULD NOT BE DIAGNOSED BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO ACCESS TO ANY NISSAN DIAGNOSTIC SOFTWARE.  I CALLED NISSAN THEN AND RECEIVED A CASE NUMBER AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO FOR ME.

THE TRANSMISSION WAS SLIPPING AND SOMETIMES WOULDN'T EVEN CHANGE GEARS, JUST KEEP REVVING UP THE ENGINE AND NOT GOING ANYWHERE. IT HAS LEFT MY CHILDREN AND ME STRANDED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS SINCE THEN. FINALLY, ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO, THE PATHFINDER DECIDED TO NOT MOVE OUT OF PARK AT ALL AFTER CRANKED. TODAY, 9/14/16, THE TRANSMISSION LEFT ME STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF HEAVY 5 O'CLOCK TRAFFIC. I BARELY HAD IT PULLED OFF THE ROAD WHEN I ALMOST GOT REAR-ENDED! THE TRANSMISSION WON'T CHANGE GEARS, WON'T PROPEL THE CAR FORWARD (OR BACKWARDS) AND THE SHOP SAID IT NEEDED A WHOLE NEW TRANSMISSION, AND MAYBE A NEW RADIATOR!

WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT IN TO THE SHOP AGAIN IT DID NOTHING.  I CALLED THE LOCAL NISSAN DEALER IN STROUDSBURG PA AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS A \"SILENT RECALL\" AND TO CHECK THE FLUID IF IT WAS A MILKY COLOR, PRETTY MUCH I WAS GOING TO BE WITHOUT A CAR. I ALWAYS TOOK CARE OF MY CAR AND FOR THIS TO HAPPEN WAS A REAL BLOW. THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME PRETTY MUCH THE REPAIR EXCEEDS THE VALUE OF THE VEHICLE.  I DID CHECK THE VALUE OF MY CAR WAS APPROXIMATELY $6-7000 FOR THE SHAPE THAT IT WAS IN.  THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO LOSE ON A VEHICLE.  ALSO, THE HAZARD OF NOT SHIFTING PROPERLY COULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT, I HAD TO PULL OFF THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY UNTIL I COULD GET IT TO SHIFT AND THIS KEPT REPEATING IT SELF OVER AND OVER.  NISSAN HAD A CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT, WHICH WHEN I CALLED NISSAN DIRECTLY THEY SAID IT DID NOT INCLUDE MY VIN NUMBER.

IN FEBRUARY OF 2014 I WENT TO GET AN OIL CHANGE AND THE MECHANIC INFORMED ME THAT THERE IS OIL IN THE ANTIFREEZE COMPARTMENT. A FEW DAYS LATER I NOTICED THAT MY CAR \"SHUTTERED\"EVERY TIME I SHIFT GEAR TO REVERSE OR TO DRIVE. I NOTICED MY VEHICLE \"LOSING POWER\" WHEN I ACCELERATED. AT ONE INSTANCE I WAS DRIVING UP A HILL AND THE VEHICLE BASICALLY LOST POWER AND IT STARTED TO REVERSE BACKWARDS WITHOUT THE GEAR BEING SHIFTED INTO REVERSE. I IMMEDIATELY STOPPED THE CAR WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKES AND TURNED THE CAR OFF. SCARIEST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND I SENT IT TO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP. THEY INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS A MANUFACTURED DEFECT WITH THE MAKE AND MODEL OF MY CAR. THE ENGINE COOLANT IS LEAKING INTO THE TRANSMISSION CAUSING THE TRANSMISSION TO BECOME DAMAGED. AFTER MONTHS OF CALLING NISSAN NORTH AMERICA THEY BASICALLY TOLD ME THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO. I FOUND THAT ABSURD SEEING THERE WAS A SETTLEMENT FOR THIS ISSUE MY CAR WAS EXPERIENCE. I ENDED UP PAYING $4000 TO REPAIR THE TRANSMISSION/RADIATOR AND OTHER ISSUES CAUSES BY THIS MANUFACTURED DEFECT THROUGH A NISSAN DEALERSHIP IN APRIL 2014. A YEAR GOES BY AND I'M NOW I'M EXPERIENCING THE SAME \"SHUTERRING\" ISSUE WHEN SHIFTING GEARS AND I NOTICED THAT MY TRANSMISSION IS SLIPPING ONCE AGAIN. THIS IS MY FIRST EVER VEHICLE. IT'S ABSURD WHAT NISSAN HAS DONE. THERE HAS TO BE JUSTICE FOR NISSAN OWNERS. NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY A NISSAN MODELED CAR. NEVER!!!!!",

MY TRUCK IS NOW STARTING TO SHOW SIGNS OF JERKING WHILE DRIVING.  A MONTH AGO , I WAS TOLD THE TRANSMISSION AND RADIATOR FLUIDS MAY BE MIXING TOGETHER.  AUTO MECHANIC SAID THE FLUIDS LOOKED MILKY.  I DRIVE MY FOUR CHILDREN , AGES 11 MONTHS TO 8 YEARS OF AGE ON A DAILY BASIS TO AND FROM SCHOOL AND AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES.  WE HAVE FAMILY IN THE KENOSHA, WISCONSIN AREA WHICH WE OFTEN FREQUENT.  I AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WILL FAIL WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT A HIGH SPEED.  WHENEVER I HAVE TO GO FAR, I DRIVE OUR  SEDAN WHICH SEATS 5 PASSENGERS, YET THERE ARE 6 PEOPLE IN OUR FAMILY.  I AM AWARE THIS IS NOT SAFE, HOWEVER I FEEL THAT IT IS SAFER THAN DRIVING MY TRUCK WHICH CAN STALL AT ANY TIME NOW.  AT THIS TIME, OUR CHILDREN ARE OUR FIRST PRIORITY AND WE WANT TO PREVENT ANY MISHAPS TO HAPPEN.  WE DON'T WANT TO BE STRANDED WITH OUR FOUR CHILDREN.

I WAS TOLD THAT NISSAN PATHFINDERS HAVE A FAULTY RADIATOR THAT LEAKS INTERNALLY INTO THE TRANSMISSION CAUSING COMPLETE TRANSMISSION FAILURE! WOULD COST $3600 TO FIX. I CALLED SUNTRUP AND WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE AND TO BRING IT IN, WHICH I DID AND $100 LATER THEY TOLD ME THE SAME THING I ALREADY KNEW FROM THE OTHER PLACE FOR FREE. THEY AGAIN SAID THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING BEFORE BUT THEY COULD FIX IT FOR $6800! I BEGAN SEARCHING (NOT TOO DIFFICULT SINCE IT IS ALL OVER THE INTERNET!) I CALLED AROUND TRYING TO FIND A MORE AFFORDABLE TRANSMISSION PLACE AND EVERY SINGLE PLACE I CALLED KNEW ABOUT THE NISSANS FAULTY RADIATORS!! THIS IS A PREVALENT PROBLEM FOR THE YEARS 2005, 2006 AND 2007 PATHFINDER, XTERRA AND AND FRONTIER!

THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD IS LOOKING INTO THIS ISSUE. I DID CONTACT SUNTRUP AND TALKED TO THE SALES MANAGER WHO SAID TO COME IN AND THEY WOULD \"TRY AND HELP ME\".

THE TECHNICIAN WAS NOT ABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. ON 6/03/09, THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO ANOTHER NISSAN DEALERSHIP TECHNICIAN FOR ADDITIONAL WORK AND AGAIN THE TECHNICIAN WAS ASKED TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. THE VEHICLE WAS SERVICED ON 8/2/13, AT A DIFFERENT NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND AGAIN THE TECHNICIAN WAS NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE THE SQUEAKING NOISE OR WHY THE STEERING COLUMN WAS LOOSE. PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT ALL THREE SERVICES MENTIONED ABOVE WERE COMPLETED AT NISSAN DEALERSHIPS AND THE SERVICES WERE WITHIN THE WARRANTY ON THE VEHICLE.    IN LATE SUMMER 2014, I NOTICED THE STEERING COLUMN BEING VERY LOOSE. ON 09/11/14, I ALERTED A NISSAN SERVICE DEPARTMENT AGAIN OF THE PROBLEM. AT THIS TIME, THE VEHICLE WAS 3,000 MILES OUTSIDE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.     THE STEERING COLUMN ISSUE CONTINUED AND ON 11/7/14, I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL NISSAN DEALERSHIP FOR MORE STEERING COLUMN TESTING. THE TECHNICIAN CONCLUDED THAT THE VEHICLE?S POWER STEERING RACK IS BREAKING APART. I SOUGHT A SECOND OPINION AND THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN CONCLUDED THAT THE STEERING COLUMN ASSEMBLY IS FAILING. AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF INQUIRY THE ISSUE IS NOW DIAGNOSED.    STEERING COLUMN - IT IS TOO LOOSE AND WHEN TURNING TO THE FAR RIGHT OR LEFT IT MAKES A CLACKING NOISE.

A FEW YEARS AGO, NISSAN ISSUED A VOLUNTARY RECALL FOR THE FUEL SENDING UNIT ON A NUMBER OF THEIR VEHICLES INCLUDING THE 2006 NISSAN PATHFINDER.  HOWEVER, THE CAMPAIGN ONLY RECALLED FUEL SENDING UNITS ON 2006 NISSAN PATHFINDERS MANUFACTURED BETWEEN JAN AND MARCH OF 2006.  NISSAN THEN EXTENDED THE WARRANTY FOR OTHER 2006 NISSAN PATHFINDERS THAT INCLUDING MY VEHICLE.  HOWEVER, THE WARRANTY EXTENSION ONLY LASTED ABOUT A YEAR AFTER IT CAME OUT. DURING THAT EXTENDED WARRANTY TIME, MY NISSAN PATHFINDER'S FUEL SENDING UNIT WAS ACTING UP (THIS IS THE DEVICE THAT TELLS YOUR FUEL GAUGE AND TRIP COMPUTER HOW CLOSE YOU ARE TO EMPTY).  HOWEVER THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP COULD NOT REPLICATE THE FAULT SO I WAS OUT OF LUCK AS THE FUEL GAUGE WOULD WORK OFF AND ON.  OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, THE FUEL GAUGE HAS CONTINUED TO ACT UP AND READ THE WRONG AMOUNT OF FUEL IN THE VEHICLE.  LAST WEEK, THE ISSUE PERSISTED LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO GET IT TO A DEALER WHO CONFIRMED THAT THE ISSUE WAS WITH THE FUEL SENDING UNIT.  HOWEVER, BY THIS TIME, THE WARRANTY HAD LAPSED AND NISSAN HAS BEEN ADAMANT THAT THEY WILL NOT PAY TO REPLACE THE FUEL SENDING UNIT BECAUSE ITS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE.  MY WIFE AND I BOTH SHARE THE VEHICLE AND TAKE OUR TWO CHILDREN IN THE CAR. I AM BECOMING WARY OF THE VEHICLE'S GAUGE MALFUNCTIONING AND AM CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THE GAUGE COULD READ FULL AND THE CAR RUNS OUT OF GAS ON THE FREEWAY AND WE GET HIT BY A SEMI TRACTOR TRAILER AND COULD BE FATALLY INJURED- THE EXACT REASON WHY NISSAN RECALLED THE SENDING UNITS ON OTHER NISSANS.  HOWEVER, NISSAN CORPORATE IS ADAMANT THAT THE FUEL SENDING UNIT WILL NOT CAUSE ANY SAFETY CONCERNS- EVEN THEIR WEBSITE SAYS SO-HTTP://WWW.NISSANASSIST.COM/WEB/FUEL-SENDING-UNIT/INDEX.PHP?MENU=2.  *TR",

THEY HAVE QUOTED US $4500.00 TO REPLACE THE DAMAGED TRANSMISSION.

UPON THE DEALER REPLACING THE RADIATOR AND FLUSHING THE COOLING SYSTEM/TRANSMISSION, THEY CALLED AND SAID THAT THE VEHICLE IS NOW THROWING OFF CODES AND THAT THE TRANSMISSION NEEDED REPLACEMENT.  IN RESEARCHING THE ISSUE ONLINE, I NOTED THERE WAS AN OPEN INVESTIGATION AS WELL AS AND EXTENDED WARRANTY OFFERED BY NISSAN FOR THIS DEFECT.  THE DEALER FAILED TO MENTION THIS, SO I FORWARDED THEM THE INFORMATION AND VISITED THEM TO DISCUSS THE DEFECT.  THE DEALER STATED THAT THERE WAS A LOWER COST VALVE BODY SERVICE THEY COULD ATTEMPT, BUT IF THAT DID NOT WORK, I WOULD NEED THE FULL REPLACEMENT, SO THEREFORE THEY RECOMMENDED THE REPLACEMENT.  THE VALVE BODY SERVICE WAS $1300 AND A NEW TRANSMISSION WAS $5300, SO IF THE SERVICE DID NOT WORK I WOULD BE LOOKING AT $6600 PLUS ANOTHER $350 FOR THE COOLING SYSTEM AND TRANSMISSION FLUSH THEY HAD ALREADY PERFORMED.  THE VEHICLE HAS 109,000 MILES ON IT, SO IT IS OUTSIDE OF THE EXTENDED WARRANTY NISSAN ISSUED FOR THIS ISSUE.  I DID TRY THEIR CUSTOMER CARE LINE TO ATTEMPT TO HAVE THEM COVER THE REPAIR SINCE IT IS ONLY 9000 MILES OUTSIDE THE WARRANTY, BUT THEY SAID THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.      BASED ON THE COST OF THE REPAIR VERSUS THE VALUE OF THE VEHICLE, IT'S HARD TO JUSTIFY THE EXPENSE AND THEREFORE I CONSIDERED NOT REPAIRING THE TRANSMISSION.  HOWEVER, THE VEHICLE IS USED BY MY WIFE TO DRIVE OUR KIDS AROUND, AND I CAN'T IMAGINE THE CONSEQUENCE OF NOT REPAIRING AND THEN HAVE A COMPLETE FAILURE LIKE SOME OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED WHILE DRIVING.

I WAS TOLD THERE WERE NO RECALLS ON MY VEHICLE OR ANY OUTSTANDING SERVICE BULLETINS IN REGARDS TO THIS PARTICULAR YEAR AND MODEL.  SINCE THE VEHICLE HAD OVER 80,000 MILES AND WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR REPAIRS.

ON MAY 9 MY VEHICLE WAS UNABLE TO GO OVER 20 MPH. IT BEGAN SHUDDERING AND LOOSING POWER WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A STANDSTILL OR AT A LOW SPEED.  AT THAT POINT, I HAD TO GET OUT OF THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC AND GET THE CAR TO A SAFE PLACE ALONG THE ROADWAY.  GOING BACK TO THE LOCAL REPAIR SHOP THEY FLUSHED THE TRANSMISSION FLUID, CHANGED THE OIL AND PUT IN NEW FILTERS. ABOUT A WEEK LATER WHEN THE ENGINE WAS HOT; IT WOULD CONTINUE TO SHUDDER UPON ACCELERATION, AGAIN THEY FLUSHED THE TRANSMISSION AND CHANGED OIL.  IT CONTINUED TO HAVE ISSUES.  ON JUNE 2 WE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL TRANSMISSION PLACE WHERE WE HAD THE TRANSMISSION REPLACED.   AT THIS TIME WE WERE TOLD ABOUT A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST NISSAN FOR NISSAN RADIATOR/TRANSMISSION COOLER LITIGATION, WHICH ALLEGES THESE VEHICLES CONTAIN A DEFECT THAT PERMITS CROSS-CONTAMINATION OF ENGINE COOLANT AND TRANSMISSION FLUID, ULTIMATELY CAUSING THE RADIATOR AND TRANSMISSION TO FAIL OR NEED SUBSTANTIAL REPAIRS.

TOOK IT THE DEALER WHEN I FIRST STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS A YEAR AGO AND THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR.  TOOK IT BACK TODAY AND NOW THEY SAY IT IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THIS PARTICULAR MODEL DUE TO A DESIGN FLAW.  THIS CAR SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECALLED FROM THE BEGINNING.  LEMON LAW SHOULD APPLY.   *TR",

THE TECH SUGGESTED THAT THE TRANSMISSION COULD BE \"SAVED\" AND I WOULD STILL HAVE TO BUY A NEW RADIATOR AND OTHER PARTS. A YEAR LATER- 03/12 MY TRUCK IS BEHAVING THE SAME WAY SO INSTEAD OF RETURNING TO THE DEALER I DECIDED TO TAKE IT TO A TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST. WHEN I INFORMED HIM OF MY PROBLEM HE ASKED IF I HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE RADIATOR, AS A MATTER A FACT I TOLD HIM I HAD IT REPLACED A YEAR AGO BECAUSE IT WAS LEAKING INTO THE TRANSMISSION. HE INFORMED ME THAT HE'S HAD A NUMBER OF PATHFINDER OWNERS COMING TO HIS SHOP ABOUT THIS VERY PROBLEM, AND INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST NISSAN. I FOUND THE LAWSUIT ON THE WEB AGAINST NISSAN AND SINCE CONTACTED THE ATTORNEY AND JOINED IN THE LAW SUIT. UP UNTIL THE MOMENT I HAD THIS PROBLEM I WAS A LOYAL NISSAN OWNER, EVEN BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN MY FATHER OWNED A DATSUN AND IT BECAME MY FIRST CAR. IT'S ONE THING TO REPLACE A TRANSMISSION SIMPLY DUE TO NORMAL WEAR, IT'S ANOTHER TO HAVE CONSUMERS DO SO BECAUSE OF FAULTY DESIGN FROM THE DEALER.

RECENTLY I WAS DRIVING AND MY CAR TOTALLY SHUT OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET. I LOST MY POWER STEERING AND COULD NOT PULL OVER. SEVERAL CARS ALMOST RAN DIRECTLY INTO MY REAR AS IT HAPPENED SO SUDDENLY. I CAME TO FIND OUT THAT THE REASON MY CAR STOPPED WAS THAT I WAS OUT OF GAS AND HAD NO IDEA THAT MY FUEL WAS LOW (DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE FUEL LEVEL INDICATOR DOES NOT WORK).  MY HUSBAND HAS THE EXACT SAME MODEL VEHICLE AS I DO AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIM. HE HAD NO IDEA THAT HE WAS LOW ON FUEL AND HIS CAR CUT OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EXTREMELY BUSY MAJOR ATLANTA EXPRESSWAY. HE HAD TO MANUALLY STEER HIS VEHICLE OFF OF THE ROAD AND AVOID BEING SMASHED INTO BY OTHER VEHICLES TRAVELING AT WELL OVER 65 MPH. SINCE DISCOVERING THIS WE BOTH TRY TO KEEP TRACK OF HOW MANY MILES WE'VE DRIVEN SINCE FILLING UP BUT WE NEVER KNOW ACCURATELY HOW MANY MILES WE CAN GET PER FILL UP. I'VE BEEN DOING RESEARCH AND HAVE FOUND DOZENS UPON DOZENS OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR NISSAN PATHFINDERS.

AFTER DISCUSSING WITH THE DEALER, IT'S GOING TO COST ABOUT $600 TO FIX THIS WELL KNOWN AND DOCUMENTED PROBLEM ON THE PATHFINDERS, XTERRAS AND FRONTIERS.  THE ISSUE IS A FUEL SENDER SENSOR THAT CAN REDUCE OR STOP GAS FROM FLOWING INTO THE ENGINE.  THIS IS A PART FAILURE THAT NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED BY NISSAN BEFORE ANYONE IS INJURED OR RESULTS IN DEATH DUE TO VEHICLE STOPPING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FREEWAY.   TO READ THAT MOST FOLKS ARE NOT FIXING THE PROBLEM DUE TO THE FINANCIAL IS JUST AS FREIGHTING, BUT I'M IN TOTAL AGREEMENT.  WHY SHOULD ANYONE HAVE TO PAY FOR A KNOWN AND DEFECTIVE PART ON A VEHICLE THAT IS 3 YEARS OLD WITH LITTLE OVER 40K MILES.    THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS, GOING BACK TO 2000.

I WENT TO AUTO ZONE AND HAD COMPUTER TESTED I WAS TOLD IT WAS A FUEL SENDING UNIT/SENSOR. I HAVE OVER 60,000 MILES ON MY VEHICLE AND IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY FOR ANY PROBLEMS. AFTER RETURNING HOME AND DOING RESEARCH, I WENT ONLINE TO X.NISSANHELP.COM AFTER PERFORMING A SEARCH, I CAME ACROSS MANY OTHERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM. APPARENTLY IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE FUEL SENDING UNIT. A SIMILAR PROBLEM WAS FOUND ON THE 2000-2004 XTERRA MODELS AND A RECALL WAS PERFORMED WHEN THE VEHICLE WOULD STOP AFTER NOT GETTING ANY FUEL, POSING A GREAT DANGER. IT SEEMS THAT SOMETHING IN THE UNIT IS FAULTY AND WILL CORRODE OVER TIME. THERE IS A GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT EVERYONE WHO IS HAVING THE PROBLEM IS EXPERIENCING THE SAME THING AFTER HAVING THE VEHICLE FOR OVER 2 YRS AND WITH AROUND 39K-49K. IF THIS PROBLEM EXISTED IN PREVIOUS MODELS, AND IT WAS RECALLED, THE 2005-2007 XTERRAS, FRONTIERS, AND PATHFINDERS SHOULD GET THIS FIXED AT NO CHARGE TO THE CUSTOMER!! WHY WAIT FOR ACCIDENTS AND POSSIBLE DEATHS, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE PROBLEM LIES IN AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE VEHICLE. COST OF REPAIR RANGES FROM $300-600. *TR",

AND UNIT FAILURE, AMONG OTHER RELATED TROUBLE CODES. ALSO AT THE REPAIR SHOP, THE ENGINE STARTED LIKE A TOP, NO WARNING LIGHTS WERE ON AND THE BRAKES HAD FULL POWER (THERE WAS NO BRAKE FLUID LEAK).

I HAVE TRIED EVERY MECHANIC I KNOW, CHANGED MY SHOCKS, AND YOU NAME IT...LATELY, I WOULD HEAR A THUMP IN THE REAR WHEN I PULLED OFF FROM STOP POSITION. THE THUMP ALSO HAPPENS WHEN I RUN OVER A SHORT SPEED BUMP. WHEN I CAME HOME ONE EVENING, I WENT UNDER THE VEHICLE TO CONDUCT A VISUAL INSPECTION TO SEE IF I WILL FIND ANYTHING. LO AND BEHOLD, I FOUND OUT THAT THE BUSHINGS OF THE LOWER CONTROL ARMS ARE WORN OUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY ARE BREAKING UP(THE BUSHINGS) WHICH ALLOWS METAL TO RUB OR HIT ANOTHER METAL AND THAT EXPLAINS THE THUMP THAT I WILL USUALLY HEAR. IN MY OPINION THE WORN OUT BUSHINGS ALSO EXPLAIN THE SWAYING THAT SEEMS TO COME FROM THE REAR BECAUSE JUST FIGURE IT OUT, THE BUSHINGS OF THE ARMS THAT LINK THE REAR AXLE TO THE BODY OF THE VEHICLE ARE WEAK, BUT THIS WILL NOT CAUSE SWAYING AT LOW SPEEDS, AND EVEN IF IT DID IT WILL BE UN-NOTICEABLE. THIS SWAYING AT HIGH SPEEDS IS DIFFICULT TO TELL SOMETIMES IF IT IS COMING FROM THE REAR OR FRONT. MY ADVISE IS TO CHANGE ESPECIALLY THE BUSHINGS OF THE REAR LOWER CONTROL ARMS, THERE SHOULD BE FOUR OF THEM, TWO LONG ONES AND TWO SHORT ONES.

I WAS ABLE TO GO STRAIGHT TO THE DEALER AND BY THE TIME I GOT THERE I COULD BARELY TURN MY STEERING WHEEL TO THE LEFT TO TURN IN. WHEN THEY EXAMINED THE CAR THEY FOUND THE UPPER BEARING IN THE STEERING COLUMN WAS SHEARING AND HAD COME APART. I WAS LUCKY I WAS CLOSE TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR AND NOT TOO FAR AWAY FROM HOME OR DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY WERE I COULD NOT PULL OVER. THEY HAD MY CAR IN THERE OVER A WEEK AND A HALF WHICH WAS A BIG INCONVENIENCE BECAUSE THEY WERE HAVING PROBLEMS LOCATING THE PART AND I WAS GETTING A RUN AROUND ABOUT IT. I WOULD CALL AND THEY WOULD NOT CALL ME BACK FOR A DAY OR TWO. THEN I WAS TOLD THEY WERE AWARE THERE HAS BEEN PROBLEMS WITH THIS HAPPENING TO THE NEW PATHFINDERS AND THEY HAD MADE A NEWER PART FOR IT THAT WOULD NOT COME APART. SO THEY FINALLY  REPLACED THE STEERING COLUMN WITH A NEW ONE AND SO FAR IT HAS DRIVEN GREAT. IT WAS A BIT UPSETTING TO GET A BRAND NEW CAR THOUGH AND IN ONLY 5 MONTHS I WAS ALREADY HAVING PROBLEMS.  *JB",
