WE WERE NOTIFIED BY PHONE THAT THE CLAIM WAS DENIED AND THE LETTER THAT ARRIVED LAST WEEK IS ATTACHED.  WE DON'T SMOKE, DID NOT HAVE ANYTHING COMBUSTIBLE IN OR NEAR THE AREA AND ARE CONCERNED THAT THE FIRE WAS RELATED TO THE CHARGERS. SOMETHING IN THAT VEHICLE ALLOWED THE CHARGERS TO OVERHEAT EVEN THOUGH THE TRUCK WAS OFF, IN OUR OPINION.  OUR CONCERN IS THAT IF THIS HAD BEEN IN A GARAGE OR HAD PEOPLE BEEN IN THE VEHICLE, LIVES COULD HAVE BEEN LOST. VEHICLE HAD 12,000 MILES ON IT.PURCHASED NEW, NO OBVIOUS CAUSE FOR THIS EVENT.
