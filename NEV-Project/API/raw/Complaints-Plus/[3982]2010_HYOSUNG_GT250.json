        "summary": "MY STEPSON WAS TRAVELING APPROX 45 MPH WESTBOUND ON DRY, LEVEL PAVEMENT DURING LATE AFTERNOON DAYLIGHT HOURS.  HE REMEMBERS THE FRONT WHEEL OF HIS HYOSUNG GT250R MOTORCYCLE WOBBLING AND HAVING NO CONTROL OF HIS STEERING.  HE THEN REMEMBERS PEOPLE HELPING HIM.  WITNESSES SAY THAT HE WAS DRIVING NORMALLY, WITHIN THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC, WHEN THEY SAW HIS FRONT WHEEL WOBBLE AND THEN THEY SAW THE MOTORCYCLE GO DOWN. THE MOTORCYCLE WENT DOWN ON ITS SIDE AND SLID A SHORT DISTANCE.  IT DID NOT FALL HARD OR ROLL, AND IT WAS NOT STRUCK.  MY STEPSON LEFT THE MOTORCYCLE AND TRAVELED ABOUT 100 FEET FURTHER.  HE WAS WEARING A HELMET, WHICH WAS DESTROYED, BUT HE SUSTAINED MANY CUTS, DEEP BRUISES, AND ABRASIONS.  THE PIMA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT RESPONDED TO THE CRASH, FILED A REPORT, AND TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS.  MOST NOTABLY:   THE CAST ALUMINUM PART IN THE CENTER OF THE HANDLEBAR ASSEMBLY WAS BROKEN IN HALF AT THE CENTER MOUNTING HOLE.  IT APPEARS TO HAVE BROKEN BEFORE THE CRASH AND APPEARS TO BE A DEFECTIVE CASTING.  THE MOTORCYCLE WAS PURCHASED NEW IN MARCH 2014 AND WAS UNDER WARRANTY.  THE DEALERSHIP REFERRED US TO HYOSUNG USA'S WARRANTY OFFICE, BUT THEY  HAVE YET TO RESPOND TO MESSAGES.  *TR",
