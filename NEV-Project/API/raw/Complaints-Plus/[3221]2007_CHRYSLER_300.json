I only had it 3 months and my motor Locked up on me with no warning \ufe0f no lights. I been reading and I see they been saying something about the oil pump going out in Chrysler motors. Now I hear they don't even make my size motor no more. U have to buy a remanufactured or rebuild one. That's alot of money I just spent to get it and now I got to pay the same amount I paid for the car for a motor because the oil pump went out without a sign or warning or light. I'm out of $5,000 and I gotta pay another $5,000 for motor. That is not right. I wish Chrysler would do something about this. That's alot of money gone down the drain in 3 months and I kept it clean and running. My oil ain't even turn color yet. It's still clear. My car been sitting down going on a whole year.",

WE OPENED UP THE ENGINE AND A PISTON HAD FAILED AND COLLAPSED IN UPON ITSELF. WE PULLED THE ENGINE AND PERFORMED A COMPLETE ENGINE REBUILD. ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO AT 134,000 MILES WE HAD A SIMILAR OCCURRENCE. WE PULLED THE HEAD AND FOUND THAT CYLINDER TWO HAD DAMAGE ON THE HEAD AND CORRESPONDING LOCATIONS ON THE PISTON. COMPRESSION TEST CONFIRMED LOSS OF COMPRESSION ON CYLINDER 2. I PURCHASED A NEW HEAD AND UPON REASSEMBLY I SHOOK THE INTAKE MANIFOLD AND DISCOVERED THERE WERE OBJECTS INSIDE. I WAS ABLE TO GET SOME OF THEM OUT AND THEY APPEAR TO BE PARTS OF THE VALVE SEAT FROM CYLINDER 2. I AM ATTACHING PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE DAMAGE TO THE CYLINDER HEAD AT CYLINDER NUMBER 2 AND ALSO THE FRAGMENTS THAT I WAS ABLE TO REMOVE FROM THE INTAKE MANIFOLD WHICH APPEAR TO BE PARTS OF THE VALVE SEAT FROM THE EXHAUST VALVE AT CYLINDER NUMBER 2. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS CAR HAS BEEN DRIVEN FOR 10 YEARS SINCE WE PURCHASED IT NEW BY MY WIFE AND HAS NEVER BEEN STRESSED RACED OR ABUSED IN ANY WAY. WE LIKE OUR CAR WHICH IS WHY I WENT THROUGH THE TROUBLE OF REBUILDING THE ENGINE 2 YEARS AGO AND HAVE GONE TO THE LENGTHS THAT I HAVE GONE TO THIS TIME. HOWEVER AFTER DISCOVERING THAT THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE WITH THIS ENGINE I DON'T FEEL THAT I CAN TRUST IT ANYMORE.

WE PAID $42,000 FOR THE CAR NEW IN 2007.  CHRYSLER SHOULD PAY FOR OUR PROBLEM SINCE THEY KNEW THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH 300, 300C ENGINES.  WE ARE OUT THE TOWING TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THE REPAIR USING A SMALL SAVINGS WE HAVE AS A RETIRED COUPLE.  A SEVEN YEAR OLD CAR WITH 44,000 MILES SHOULD HAVE A ENGINE LAST LONGER.  AS NOTED THE CAR WAS STOPPED AND PARKED AT A SUPERMARKET FOR NO MORE THAN 15 MINUTES AND DID NOT DEMONSTRATE ANY ENGINE PROBLEMS PRIOR TO THIS PROBLEM DROVE BEAUTIFULLY.

AFTERWARDS I STILL HAD TO PAY A $50.00 DEDUCTIBLE. I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE IT CAME WITH THIS LIFETIME POWER TRAIN WARRANTY.

IF THEY ARE THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF THE 07 CHRYSLER 300C AND HAVE KEPT UP THE REQUIRED MAINTENANCE ON IT THEN THEY TO SHOULD HAVE A LIFETIME WARRANTY ON THOSE REPAIRS AS THEY ARE PART OF THE POWER TRAIN.

THERE'S NO IN-BETWEEN. IT'S EITHER COLD OR VERY HOT. THIS IS DANGEROUS AND VERY AGGRAVATING.  ON ANOTHER NOTE, THE PAST WINTER I DIDN'T DRIVE MY 300C FOR A MONTH DO TO THE ICE AND SNOW. I LEFT IT PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY. THE BATTERY DIED. SO I CHARGED IT AND NOW THE 3 LIGHTS, THE ANTI-LOCK BREAKS, SKID AND TRACTION WONT GO OFF. I'VE CHECKED ALL THE FUSES AND EVEN HOOKED UP THE SCANNER TO CHECK FOR CODES. NO BAD FUSES AND NO BAD CODES. I'VE DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY CABLE HOPING THAT  MIGHT RESET WHAT EVER IS CAUSING THE LIGHTS TO STAY ON. STILL NO LUCK. I'VE DROVE THE CAR ALL SPRING, SUMMER AND NOW FALL 2014 WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKES OR STEERING.

LEAVING TO TAKE MY SON TO SUMMER SCHOOL THIS MORNING AND COULD NOT GET MY CAR OUT OF THE PARK POSITION. HAD TO BREAK  INTO THE CENTER CONSOLE AND USE A SCREWDRIVER TO GET THE CAR IN DRIVE.  \"UNFORTUNATELY\" I KNEW HOW TO DO THIS BECAUSE THE 2007 MODEL THAT I OWNED THREE YEARS AGO DID THE EXACT SAME THING.  I HAVE TO LEAVE MY CAR IN NEUTRAL AND PUT MY PARKING BRAKE DOWN WHEN EVER I PARK MY CAR BECAUSE IF I PLACE IT IN PARK I WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THE STEPS AGAIN TO UNLOCK IT. HUGE ISSUE AND NEEDS TO BE RECALLED IMMEDIATELY.  ALSO WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT THE REPLACEMENT PIECE HAPPENS TO BE MEDAL.  SO I ASK WHY WOULD CHRYSLER GO THE CHEAP ROUTE AND PLACE A PLASTIC PIECE IN ALL OF THE VEHICLES (THAT COST A PRETTY PENNY) INSTEAD OF DOING IT RIGHT THE FIRST TIME AND HAVING THE MEDAL PIECE IN IT FROM THE START.  SOUNDS LIKE A WAY TO GET CUSTOMERS TO GO TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIRS AND SPEND MORE MONEY.  HORRIBLE BUSINESS ETHICS AND DUE TO THIS ISSUE HAPPENING TO ME TWICE ON TWO SEPARATE VEHICLES I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER CHRYSLER JEEP OR DODGE AGAIN!  *TR",

FINALLY BROKE INTO THE SHIFTER LEVER BY REMOVING THE COVERS (VERY TRICKY TO DO, AS I DIDN'T HAVE MY TOOLS), SO MY HUSBAND WOULDN'T HAVE TO COME PICK ME UP AN HOUR AWAY.    I ALMOST DIDN'T FIGURE THIS OUT, SO LUCKY FOR ME I KEPT TRYING IT.  THERE ARE LOTS (MANY, MANY) SITES THAT TALK ABOUT THIS SAME PROBLEM ON CHRYSLER 300S, INCLUDING YOUTUBE (WHICH SHOWS HOW TO UNSCREW THE WHOLE THING), AND AUTOMOTIVE FORUMS.  THERE ARE SOME SMALL NEON PINK PLASTIC PIECES THAT KEEP THE SHIFTER LEVER WORKING PROPERLY, THE ONLY THING KEEPING THE CAR FROM BECOMING A GIANT PAPERWEIGHT (UNLESS ONE KNOWS TO PULL APART THE COVERS ALL THE WAY TO ACCESS THE GEARS/WIRES - NOT A REASONABLE THING TO EXPECT FROM MOST CONSUMERS).    FOR NOW, I HAVE TO PULL A WIRE TO GET OUT OF PARK. HAPPENS WHEN PUT IN REVERSE ALSO.  THIS ALSO LEADS TO PPL KEEPING THEIR FOOT ON THE BRAKE INSTEAD OF GOING INTO PARK, JUST SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO MESS WITH THE WIRE.     WE HAVE PEOPLE ACCIDENTALLY GOING FORWARD AND HITTING THINGS AS THEY TRY TO STAY IN DRIVE RATHER THAN PUTTING IT INTO PARK, WHILE TALKING TO SOMEONE THEY KNOW ON THE STREET/SIDEWALK AND FORGETTING TO KEEP THEIR FOOT ON THE BRAKE,  (BE IT AT A SLOW SPEED, BUT STILL NOT GOOD IF CHILDREN GET IN THE WAY WHILE ONE ISN'T PAYING ATTENTION).  I WILL BE TAKING THE CAR BACK TO DEALER TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DOWN ABOUT IT.    THIS IS DEFINITELY A PROBLEM FOR ANYONE RELYING ON THEIR CAR BEING ABLE TO DO SIMPLE THINGS LIKE SHIFT INTO DRIVE (OR REALLY ANYTHING OTHER THAN 'PARK'), AND IS A SAFETY RISK DUE TO DRIVERS ATTEMPTING TO USE THE CAR.  WHAT COULD HAVE DISTURBED THESE PLASTIC PIECES IS MY MILE LONG DIRT DRIVEWAY THAT IS A LITTLE BUMPY AND VERY WET CURRENTLY.    I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING DONE ON THIS, SO THAT OTHER PEOPLE DON'T GO THROUGH THE SAME PROBLEM AS I DID.  THANK YOU!  *TR",

I CAME TO A STOP BUT WHILE DOING SO MY RIGHT FRONT WHEEL JACK KNIFED AND CAUSED THE STEERING WHEEL TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY. IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO JUST KEEP THE VEHICLE GOING STRAIGHT AS I CAME TO A STOP.I HAD TO LEAVE MY VEHICLE MOSTLY IN THE FAST LANE SINCE I COULD NOT STEER IT AND THERE WAS NO SHOULDER TO PULL OVER ONTO. I HAD TO JUMP OVER ON OPEN SPOT THAT I COULD SEE 40 FEET BELOW ME ON I-5 TO GET TO A QUIETER AREA TO MAKE MY PHONE CALLS FOR EMERGENCY HELP. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP.  THE SERVICE WRITER HAD NO TIME SO I DID AND FOUND A BROKEN HEAVY DUTY BALL JOINT THAT CONNECTS TO MY FRONT RIGHT WHEEL. IT HAD SHEERED IN THE MIDDLE AND CAUSED MY STEERING TO GO OUT AND DAMAGED MY ABS BRAKING AND THE BRAKE SHIELD PLATE ALONG WITH SCRAPING THE INSIDE OF MY RIGHT FRONT WHEEL. I THEN CALLED CHRYSLER CORPORATE AT THERE HOTLINE AND WAS ASKING ABOUT A RECALL OR WARRANTY HELP. I WENT TO THE PARTS COUNTER AND TALKED WITH THEM AND THEY SAID THIS HAPPENS REGULARLY AND WE KEEP A SUPPLY OF BALL JOINTS ON HAND BECAUSE OF THIS. I PURCHASED THE BALL JOINT FOR MY VEHICLE. I ASKED HOW MUCH TO INSTALL THE PART AND IF THERE WAS A WARRANTY ON THERE WORK. HE SAID FOR 12 MONTHS THEY WOULD WARRANTY THE PART IF THEY INSTALLED IT. THEY FOUND MORE STEERING PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE. THEY REPLACED THE LEFT BALL JOINT SINCE THEY SAW IT GOING OUT ALONG WITH THE LEFT AND RIGHT TIE RODS BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOSE ALONG WITH ABS PARTS THAT WERE RUINED. I WAS TOLD THAT THE LOCAL POLICE DRIVE DODGE CHARGERS THAT HAVE THE SAME STEERING AS A CHRYSLER 300 AND THEY ARE REPLACING BALL JOINTS ON THOSE VEHICLES REGULARLY ALONG WITH THE CHRYSLER 300.   *TR",

GRAVEN CHRYSLER CALLED THE NEXT MORNING, 10-11-11 7:53AM MY CAR WAS READY. GRAVEN SAID IT WAS GOING TO COST $135. I SAID THAT THE WORK WAS WARRANTY. GRAVEN SAID IT WASN'T WARRANTY WORK BECAUSE PART NUMBER DOESN'T COME BACK AS WARRANTY. I EXPLAINED TO THE ASSISTANT THAT IT IS WARRANTY, THAT MY CAR HAS A LIFETIME POWERTRAIN WARRANTY. SHE SAID THAT ONLY COVERS THE ENGINE, TRANSMISSION AND DRIVELINE. I SAID IT ALSO COVERS A LOT OF OTHER PARTS WHICH I HAVE A LIST OF. SHE THEN SAID, YOU WILL HAVE TO TALK WITH CHRYSLER AND THERE WAS NOTHING SHE COULD DO. CHRYSLER SAID I HAVE TO PAY A $50.00 CO-PAY. I SAID WHY SHOULD I PAY A CO-PAY WHEN THIS PART HAS A LIFETIME WARRANTY. I WAS TOLD I CAN PAY THE $50.00 OR $185. I SAID THAT I WAS TOLD IT WAS $135. I SAID FOR NOW I WILL PAY THE $50.00 BUT WOULD FILE A COMPLAINT FOR THE WARRANTY AND GETTING MY $50.00 BACK. THE NEXT DAY I RECEIVED A CALL FROM CHRYSLER. I WAS ASKED HOW MY CAR WAS RUNNING. I SAID IT DROVE HOME OK. SHE SAID THAT SHE WOULD CLOSE THE CASE THEN. I SAID THAT I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU MADE ME PAY $50.00 CO-PAY WHEN THE PART IS LISTED ON THE PAPERWORK AS HAVING A LIFETIME WARRANTY UNDER THE POWERTRAIN. SHE SAID THAT I COULD CALL GRAVEN CHRYSLER BACK AND TRY AND GET THEM TO EXCEPT IT.

WE LIVE IN BASE HOUSING SO WE PARK OUR VEHICLES IN A PARKING LOT. AT ABOUT 5:00P.M. THE END OF THE PARKING LOT WERE MY 2007 CHRYSLER 300 LIMITED WAS PARKED BEGIN TO FLOOD WITH WATER. MY HUSBAND WENT OUT TO MOVE THE CAR FROM THE BEFORE THE WATER GOT TO HIGH. AT THIS TIME THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY 3 INCHES OF WATER ON THE GROUND. HE BACKED THE CAR OUT OF THE PARKING SPACE TO MOVE IT. ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS WAS COMING THE PARKING LOT AT THE TIME AND FORCED MY HUSBAND TO DRIVE OUT INTO THE STREET AND RE-ENTER THE PARKING LOT.  AS HE DROVE OUT INTO THE STREET, I NOTICED THAT HE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED.  I WENT OUT TO SEE WHAT WAS WRONG AND HE TOLD ME THE CAR SHUT-OFF. A COUPLE OF OUR NEIGHBORS HELPED HIM PUSH IT OUT OF THE STREET INTO THE PARKING LOT. NOT SURE WHAT WAS WRONG WE CALLED OUT INSURANCE AND THEY SENT OUT A TOW TRUCK TO GET THE VEHICLE AND TAKE IT TO A NEAR BY CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP. THE DEALERSHIP CALLED ON FRIDAY TO LET US KNOW THAT THE VEHICLE SUCKED UP WATER THROUGH THE AIR INTAKE AND HD=YDROLOCKED THE ENGINE. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH WE FOUND OUT THE  AIR INTAKE FOR THIS CAR, AND ITS COUNTERPARTS THE DODGE CHARGER AND MAGNUM, ARE LOCATED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE FRONT BUMPER APPROXIMATELY 20IN. ABOVE THE GROUND. I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS ISSUE AND HAVE BEEN AMAZED HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM BECAUSE THE AIR INTAKE SYSTEM IS POORLY DESIGNED.  CHRYSLER NEEDS TO OWN UP TO THIS DESIGN FLAW AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROBLEMS IT IS CAUSING. I WATCHED NUMEROUS OTHER VEHICLES DRIVE DOWN THAT STREET THAT DAY, SOME AT A MUCH FASTER RATE THAN MY HUSBAND, AND THEY HAD NO PROBLEMS.  THIS IS REALLY A BAD DESIGN. CHRYSLER NEEDS TO RECALL ALL 2006 AND 2007 CHRYSLER 300, DODGE MAGNUM AND DODGE CHARGER. OUR INSURANCE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE MY VEHICLE REPAIRED FOR A POORLY DESIGNED SYSTEM.
