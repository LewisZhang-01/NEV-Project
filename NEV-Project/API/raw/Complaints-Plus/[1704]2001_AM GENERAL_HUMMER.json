THE MIRROR IS USELESS FOR PROPER AND SAFE VIEWING WHEN THIS HAPPENS.  A CHECK OF THE HUMMER GROUP WEB SITES REVEALED MANY PEOPLE SIMILARLY SITUATED.  THIS IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT OF A FEDERALLY REQUIRED SAFETY SYSTEM AND MUST BE ADDRESSED BEFORE A FATALITY IS CAUSED BY MANUFACTURER PROBLEM NEGLECT.  REMEMBER THESE VEHICLES COST OVER $100,000.00 AND SHOULD BE SAFE.  I CALLED AMG AND TALKED TO MR. GIEFING.  HE STATED HE WAS UNAWARE OF THIS FAILURE MODE.  I HAD A MIRROR REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY LAST YEAR - HOW COULD THE FIELD SERVICE MANAGER NOT KNOW OF THE PROBLEM.  ANNUAL PRODUCTION OF THESE VEHICLES IS ONLY 400 PER YEAR.  SO DO WE NEGLECT SAFETY DUE TO LOW PRODUCTION NUMBERS.  A PROPERLY WORKING REAR VIEW MIRROR IS REQUIRED IN ALL VEHICLES BY LAW - IT SHOULD NOT HAVE A MANUFACTURER DEFECT.",
