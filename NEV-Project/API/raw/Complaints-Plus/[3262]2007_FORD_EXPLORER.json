I EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE PROBLEM WAS RELATED TO THE IGNITION SINCE I HAD SEEN A SIMILAR RECALL ON GM VEHICLES. FORD SAID WOULD CHARGE LABOR TIME TO RECREATE THE PROBLEM. I WAS THEN ABLE TO RECREATE PROBLEM IN LOT BY TOUCHING KEYS. I ALERTED SERVICE DESK AND WAITED 20 MIN WITH ENGINE RUNNING FOR A TECHNICIAN TO COME AND WITNESS THE PROBLEM. THEY FINALLY SENT THE GIRL THAT WORKS THE SERVICE COUNTER WHO SAID TURN IT OFF AND WE WILL PULL IT INTO THE BAY AND HAVE A TECHNICIAN TRY TO RECREATE IT IN THE MORNING, CONFIRMING THEY WOULD CHARGE LABOR TIME TO RECREATE THE PROBLEM. SHE WAS VERY RUDE AND TOLD ME NO TECHNICIAN WAS GOING TO COME OUT AND THAT I COULD LEAVE THE CAR OR NOT, THEN STORMED INSIDE. I LEFT WITHOUT THE PROBLEM RESOLVED AND MADE AN APPT.

TRANSMISSION SHIFTS TOO HARD AND HESITATES GOING INTO REVERSE WITH A LOUD BANG INTO GEAR.  I REALLY LIKE MY CAR EXCEPT THAT IT JERKS FORWARD WHEN I AM SLOWING DOWN TO STOP.  THIS OCCURS AS MY TRANSMISSION DOWN-SHIFTS FROM EITHER 3RD TO 2ND GEAR OR 2ND TO 1ST GEAR.  IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM.  IT LUNGES MY CAR FORWARD WHEN I AM BRAKING TO STOP.   AFTER THEY REPROGRAMMED PCM AND IT RUNS FINE FOR ABOUT A WEEK THEN BACK TO THE SAME PROBLEM.  FORD SHOULD RECALL THIS VEHICLE WITH RADIATOR/TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS. I THINK WHEN RADIATOR WAS LEAKING THEN IT CAUSED TRANSMISSION TO FAIL BECAUSE ITS CONNECTING LINES BETWEEN RADIATOR AND TRANSMISSION.  THERE WAS NO WARNING LIGHT CAME ON MY INSTRUMENT PANEL. IT IS SO DANGEROUS TO DRIVE ESPECIALLY WITH MY FAMILY AND CHILDREN TOO.  I DON'T THINK IF IT WAS A PCM PROBLEM.  IT IS A PHYSICAL DAMAGE INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION.  WE ARE NOT PAYING TO REBUILD OR A NEW TRANSMISSION FOR AROUND $4,000 WHILE I AM STILL PAYING ON THE CAR LOAN.  FORD MUST DO SOMETHING AND RECALL THIS EXPLORER VEHICLES NOW!!!!

NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WAS AVAILABLE DUE TO FORD POLICY... SUPPOSEDLY. I MOVED TO TEXAS IN JUNE OF 2012 AND IT DID OKAY. THEN ONE DAY, IN SEPTEMBER, I HAD MY HUSBAND AND CHILDREN IN THE SUV AND ALL OF SUDDEN IT JUST STARTED ACTING STRANGE, WOULDN'T SPEED UP, THE RPM'S WOULD GO CRAZY, THE NOISE SOUNDED HORRIBLE AND THEN IT JUST STOPPED MOVING. LUCKILY WE WERE JUST HEADING OUT OF TOWN AND NOT YET ON THE MAJOR HIGHWAY. WE GOT IT MOVED TO A SERVICE STATION AND HAD TO CALL OUR INSURANCE COMPANY TO TOW OUR VEHICLE TO A FORD DEALERSHIP. WE HAD TO WAIT MORE THAN AN HOUR FOR A RIDE HOME. WE WERE NOW WITHOUT A VEHICLE IN A NEW STATE. I WAS TOLD THAT THE ONLY FIX WAS TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION. I PUT $4000 DOWN ON THIS VEHICLE, FINANCED THE REST AND SPENT THE REST OF OUR SAVINGS TO MOVE FROM NE TO TX. I HAD NO EXTRA CASH TO SPEND $4000 TO FIX IT. I WAS TOLD TO LET THE BANK TAKE IT AND GET ANOTHER VEHICLE. I HAD TO COME UP WITH $1000 DOWN AND GET A LOWER QUALITY VEHICLE AND HAVE THE BANK TAKE IT BACK. THEY SOLD IT AT AUCTION FOR ONLY $4000 SO WE STILL OWE $13000! I HAD THE VEHICLE FOR ONLY 5 MONTHS AND BECAUSE OF A FORD PROBLEM I OWE $13000?!?!?! THIS IS NOT RIGHT.

WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE LANE OF THIS 3 LANE HIGHWAY IN MODERATE 75 MPH TRAFFIC AND ABOUT  MILE NORTH OF EXIT #473  WHEN SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS WARNING (SUCH AS THE WAY A VEHICLE HANDLES WHEN A TIRE IS GOING FLAT OR A WHEEL IS COMING LOOSE), THERE WAS A LOUD BANG ACCOMPANIED BY HIGH VIBRATION AND A LOUD RUMBLING NOISE LIKE A TIRE BLOWOUT.  THE NOISE AND VIBRATION LASTED A SECOND OR SO, THEN STOPPED FOR A SECOND OR SO, THEN RESUMED AGAIN FOR ANOTHER SECOND OR SO AFTER WHICH THE VIBRATION STOPPED AND THE LOUD RUMBLING NOISE WAS REPLACED BY A LOUD STEADY SCRAPING/GRINDING NOISE.  I GOT  ONTO THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY IN ABOUT 15 SECONDS.  DURING THIS I HAD NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTY IN STEERING OR CONTROLLING THE EXPLORER.      THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR WHEEL HAD COME OFF. ALL 5 LUG BOLTS WERE FRACTURED THROUGH AND ALL BUT THEIR SHORT PORTIONS THAT ARE THREADED INTO THE HUB, WERE MISSING.

NO CALL FROM ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE HAD BEEN RECEIVED. HAD CELL PHONE SERVICE THE ENTIRE TIME.  CALLED THEM MYSELF AROUND 9:30 P.M. THEY HAD NO RECORD OF THE CALL FROM EARLIER IN THE DAY WHICH REFERENCED MY CELL PHONE NUMBER. IF THE TOW HAD BEEN ARRANGED EARLIER, IT COULD HAVE BEEN AT THE DEALER BEFORE THEY CLOSED ON FRIDAY.  IF I HAD KNOWN THIS WOULDN'T HAPPEN (THE TOW), I WOULD HAVE CALLED MY OWN TOWING COMPANY TO DO IT.  HORRIBLE SERVICE!  :)  SO WE WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAVE FOR VACATION ON MONDAY, BUT NOT SURE WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW WITH ONLY A SMALL VEHICLE TO USE FOR 4 PEOPLE AND 4 SUITCASES!  NOT SURE IT WILL BE FEASIBLE. ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE SAYS THE VEHICLE WILL BE DELIVERED TO DEALER TOMORROW.  WAITING TO HEAR WHAT THE DEALER HAS TO SAY, BUT BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE AM NOT VERY OPTIMISTIC.  I FEEL THIS PROBLEM DIRECTLY RELATES TO THE REPLACEMENT OF THE GEAR SHIFTER (WHICH I DON'T THINK NEEDED TO HAPPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE).  ALSO JUST RECENTLY NOTICED THAT THE CONSOLE AROUND THE RADIO AND THE HEAT DUCT WAS LOOSE.",

TOLD HIM THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR A \"GOODWILL\" REPAIR ON BEHALF OF FORD MOTOR CO.  I FELT THAT THIS ISSUE SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY, OTHERWISE, WHY WOULD PEOPLE BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY IF THEY COULDN'T COUNT ON IT COVERING ANYTHING?  FINAL RESOLUTION WAS THAT THEY WOULD CONTACT THE DEALERSHIP TO MAKE THE REPAIR, I WOULD PAY THE $50 DEDUCTIBLE THAT I WOULD HAVE HAD TO PAY HAD THE WARRANTY COVERED THE SERVICE.  I WAS BASICALLY TOLD \"DON'T EXPECT THAT THE NEXT TIME SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS THAT YOU CAN CALL FORD AND THEY WILL TAKE CARE OF IT.\"  THE BOTTOM LINE IS I AM SATISFIED THAT IT IS BEING REPAIRED FOR THE $50 DEDUCT.

HE EXPLAINED THAT FOR SOME REASON THE PCM THINKS THE ENGINE IS OVERHEATING AND IT IS TRYING TO INCREASE AIR FLOW THROUGH THE RADIATOR. MAKES SENSE. HOWEVER THERE ARE NO CODES SHOWING AN OVERHEATING PROBLEM. HMMMM'' UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION IT WAS FOUND THAT THE TRANS WAS THROWING OF AN OVERHEAT CODE! I'M NOT SURE WHY THAT WAS NOT APPARENT FROM THE BEGINNING. THE LAPTOP SHOWED THE TRANS TEMP AT 270!. NO WAY! SO UP ON THE LIFT, AND PHYSICALLY CHECK THE TRANS TEMP AND FLUID TEMP. WELL, 160 ALL DAY LONG! TURNS OUT THAT THE THERMO BYPASS WAS FAULTY AND WAS MISINFORMING THE PCM THAT THE TRANS WAS OVERHEATING AND THE PCM WAS LOCKING UP THE FAN CLUTCH TO PULL MORE AIR TO COMPENSATE. REPLACED THE THERMO BYPASS AND SO FAR PROBLEM SOLVED. TO DO THIS YOU MUST DROP THE TRANS PAN AND REMOVE THE VALVE BODY AS THE THERMO BYPASS IS LOCATED IN THE VALVE BODY. *TR",

IT WANTS TO SURGE BETWEEN FIRST AND SECOND GEAR AND WHEN IT FINALLY GOES IN IT JUST SLAMS ITSELF IN. ALSO IF YOU ARE IDLING ALONG AT A SLOW SPEED IT ACTS LIKE YOU ARE GENTLY GIVING IT GAS AS IT SPEEDS UP AND SLOWS DOWN. THE BACK LOCK ON THE WINDOW WANTS TO POP OPEN A LOT ALSO. THE DEALER HAS REPROGRAMMED THE TRANSMISSION ONCE AND FOR ABOUT A WEEK I THOUGHT IT WAS FIXED. THEN IT STARTED ALL OVER AGAIN WITH THE TRANSMISSION. THE EXPLORER NOW SITS IN MY GARAGE FOR 99.9% OF THE TIME. IT HAS 5808.8 MILES ON IT. I GOT SO DISGUSTED WITH THE THING I BOUGHT A 2008 TOYOTA CAMRY AND JUST LOVE IT. I HAVE BEEN A UNION MEMBER ALL MY LIFE AND HAVE ALWAYS BOUGHT AMERICAN PRODUCTS BUT IT SEEMS THE AMERICAN MANUFACTURES NO LONGER CARE OR THERE DESIGNERS NO LONGER CARE AS SOME OF THE FOREIGN MANUFACTURES ARE PUTTING OUR PRODUCTS TO SHAME. THIS USED TO BE A PROUD COUNTRY BUT NOW IT IS JUST GREED. I BELIEVE I HAVE BOUGHT MY LAST AMERICAN CAR OR UNTIL THEY GET THERE ACT BACK TOGETHER. FORD MOTOR YOU ARE PUTTING OUT JUNK.
