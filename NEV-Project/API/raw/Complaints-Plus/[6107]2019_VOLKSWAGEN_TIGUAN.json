The engine kept running, but she lost all the lights, headlights, break lights, radio, ac, speedometer, etc.  Basically everything stopped working except the engine.  Obviously this was a safety concern for me because she's 16 and didn't have headlight, or break lights, or a speedometer, just to name a few.  Volkswagen dealership in mckinney, TX, began diagnosing the issue.  They changed the battery and said the car was fixed.  Unfortunately, as my now 17 year old daughter was driving, the car all the sudden lost all power again.  The danger is that the car starts and performs perfectly at first, but will shutdown everything but the engine while she's driving!  So this is the 2nd time this has happened.  The car went back to the dealership and they a \"software update\", and claimed that corrected the problem eventhough I suspect they dint truly believe they fixed it.  So my daughter starts her car and drives down the road with no problems, until, for the individual time, she loses power while driving over 50 mph.  So the car is at the dealership for a 3rd time.

BOTH TIMES IT HAPPENED I WAS FAR ENOUGH BACK FROM OTHER VEHICLES. THE MOST RECENT EXPLOSION WAS WORSE. A HUGE HOLE WAS LEFT AND PIECES WERE FLYING OFF BEHIND MY VEHICLE. THANKFULLY I HAD THE MESH SCREEN CLOSED, SO NONE OF THE GLASS CAME INTO THE VEHICLE ON ME. THE HOLE THAT WAS LEFT THE SECOND TIME WAS HUGE AND FLARED OUTWARDS, WHICH INDICATES A DEFECT IN THE MANUFACTURING OF THE GLASS. IT IS A DEFINITE SAFETY RISK.

DURING THE 2-DAY WAITING PERIOD, I WAS STOPPED IN A TURNING LANE ON A FOUR-LANE, LIGHTED ROAD TO MAKE A U-TURN. WHEN I HIT THE GAS PEDDLE TO GO THE CAR JERKED FORWARD, AND WENT TO A STANDSTILL FOR ABOUT 5-SECONDS WHILE MY FOOT WAS FIRMLY PRESSING THE GAS PEDDLE. THIS CAUSED THE TWO ONCOMING VEHICLES TO HAVE TO SCREECH TO A STOP; AND THE VEHICLE IN THE MIDDLE LANE HAD TO SWERVE TO AVOID HITTING ME AND SPIN OUT. WHEN THE TIGUAN STARTED MOVING FORWARD, I HAD TO PULL OVER BECAUSE I WAS SHAKING. THE SAME ISSUE HAPPENED AGAIN THE NEXT DAY, BUT NO ONCOMING CARS WERE IN SIGHT.    WENT IN FOR THE DOOR APPOINTMENT, I TOLD THE SERVICE REP ABOUT ENGINE AND ASKED TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER. AN ASSISTANT MANAGER CAME OUT,  I TOLD HIM ABOUT THE ENGINE, AND HE RESPOND THAT'S A VW AND GAVE ME A HUG AND TWO FREE T-SHIRTS.     NEW DOOR HANDLE HAD TO BE ORDERED DUE TO CORROSION, HAD TO COME BACK 3-DAYS LATER TO HAVE IT FIXED. DURING THOSE 3-DAYS, THE PASSENGER SEAT SEAT BELT WARNING SOUND STARTED RANDOMLY GOING OFF, ALONG WITH THE AIRBAG LIGHT FLASHING ABOVE THE HAZARD LIGHT WHEN MY HANDBAG WAS ON THE SEAT. REPORTED THAT AND THE ENGINE ISSUE AGAIN AT NEXT APPOINTMENT. HAD TO LEAVE THE CAR FOR TWO DAYS...AT PICK-UP WAS TOLD EVERYTHING WAS TESTED FINE, BUT VW DID NOT BOTHER TO TEST THE SEAT SENSOR. WAS INSTRUCTED TO NOT PUT ANYTHING ON THE PASSENGER SEAT, AS STATED IN THE CAR'S MANUAL.    REQUESTED A NEW VEHICLE, OR LET ME OUT OF MY LEASE DUE TO FEELING TOTALLY UNSAFE...WAS DENIED BY BOTH CORPORATE AND DEALER.     MONEY SHOULD NEVER COME BEFORE SAFETY, SO I PAID $3000 TO BREAK MY LEASE TODAY AS VW CORP & DEALER TOLD ME TO GET BACK IN THAT CAR.    THIS IS A DEADLY SAFETY ISSUE.",
