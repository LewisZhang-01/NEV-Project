        "summary": "In mid 2017 I went for a drive in my 2007 Chevy Cobalt. (just over 100,000 miles). When I was approximately 4 blocks from my home the engine began sputtering and died. I was able to pull in a parking lot, put it in park and jumped out of my car. An overwhelming smell of gas was immediately noticed, as well as a huge puddle of fuel on the ground. I began to walk the 4 blocks home and saw a huge continuous trail of gasoline upon the road leading from my car ALL the way to my home! In this 4 block distance my Cobalt leaked out over 3/8ths of a tank of fuel- nearly 5-6 gallons. The fuel vapor in the air was most assuredly at a very dangerous explosive level this entire distance home.  I am a self taught mechanic with many engine re-builds and repairs under my belt. Upon inspection I found that the steel fuel line had a major rupture above the driver rear wheel within the foil wrapped \"joke\" of a heat shield- (just above the exhaust pipe). Upon further inspection this steel fuel line was badly rusted & corroded all the way to under the driver seat. Overall the Cobalt fuel line system is a very poor design, poor quality materials, with bad design & placement.  I ordered a complete new fuel & return line set and replaced all the rusty junk fuel lines. My experience with the instantaneous fuel line failure could have had a very bad ending. No warning lights or previous leaks were detected.  Then there is the front suspension and front wheel bearing issues. I have installed 2 complete front suspension kits, ball joints, struts, as well as 2 wheel bearing failures- all these replaced with less than 80,000 miles on the odometer. Then there is the bad window switches, bad moon roof seal, bad wiper arm assemblies, front stereo speaker failure at 39,000 miles, on & on. A very poor quality vehicle   After purchasing this Cobalt I would be very hesitant to purchase another GM product.",

IN THESE CARS THE RELAY CIRCUIT IS BUILT IN THE UNDERSIDE OF THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT FUSE BOX.  THE BOX IS NOT SEAL PROPERLY AND MOISTURE GETS INTO THE BOX, CAUSING A FAILURE ON THE CIRCUIT BOARD.  THIS CAR FIRST STARTED DOING THIS BACK IN 2009 WHEN MY DAUGHTER HAD IT.   I RECENTLY TOOK THE CAR BACK AND IT WAS STILL BEHAVING IN THIS MANNER.   THE WORK AROUND THAT SEEMED TO WORK FOR A LONG TIME WAS TO MANUALLY TURN THE AUTO LIGHTS OFF USING THE MULTIFUNCTION LEVER ON THE STEERING WHEEL.   TODAY, THE LIGHTS STARTED COMING ON BY THEMSELVES WHEN THE CAR WAS PARKED. ALSO, TURNING THE AUTO LIGHTS OFF MANUALLY HAS STOPPED BEING EFFECTIVE.

I HAVE TAKEN IT TO USED CAR DEALER THAT I BOUGHT CAR FROM; THEY INSTRUCTED ME TO CALL GENERAL MOTORS BECAUSE IT APPEARS AS A SAFETY ISSUE AFTER THEY INVESTIGATED IT. GENERAL MOTORS TOLD ME IT WAS NOT A RECALL, YET THEY WERE AWARE IT IS A SERVICE ISSUE MULTIPLE PEOPLE WITH THE SAME YEAR, MAKE AND MODEL HAVE DEALT WITH. THEY INSTRUCTED ME TO TAKE IT TO NEAREST CHEVY DEALER TO HAVE IT SERVICES AT A UNREASONABLE COST. CALLED LOCAL CHEVY DEALER THEY WANTED DIAGNOSING PAYMENT PLUS PAYMENT TO SERVICE THE VEHICLE. I DID NOT TAKE VEHICLE TO CHEVY BECAUSE THE PRICING IS OUTRAGEOUS, THIS ISSUE HAS OCCURRED WITH MULTIPLE VEHICLES OR THE SAME YEAR, MAKE AND MODEL. IT IS OBVIOUSLY A SAFETY ISSUE THAT GM SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR. OTHERS HAVE WRITTEN ONLINE ABOUT PAYING FOR THE SERVICE AND IT OCCURRING AGAIN OR EVEN ACCIDENTS OCCURRING WITH AIRBAG MALFUNCTIONS.",

I HAVE ORIENTATION ON THIS DAY (EARLY IN THE MORNING) AND CANNOT TAKE MY CAR IN. I DO HOPE MY WHEEL DOES NOT FREEZE UP ON THE FREEWAY!

THE CAR FELT LIKE A STALL; I COULD NOT MOVE THE STEERING WHEEL AND ON THE DASHBOARD THE MESSAGE READ \"POWER STEERING\". THIS FLASHED ON, REMAINED LIT UP FOR AWHILE. I TURNED THE CAR OFF. AFTER A MINUTE OR SO I STARTED THE CAR AGAIN, AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE WITHOUT FAILURE OF THE POWER ASSISTED STEERING.  I HAVE REQUESTED AGAIN THAT GENERAL MOTORS REPAIR THIS PROBLEM UNDER THE ORIGINAL RECALL NOTICE IN 2010 SINCE THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS AND SHOWS UP UNEXPECTEDLY AT ANY TIME.  I REQUESTED TERRY CULLEN TO ASK THAT GENERAL MOTORS REPAIR THIS PROBLEM FREE OF CHARGE TO ME.  I ALSO HAVE SPOKEN TO A FEMALE CSR AT GENERAL MOTORS ABOUT REPAIRING THIS PROBLEM WITHOUT CHARGE TO ME.

HE TOLD ME TO LOOK ON THE DASHBOARD, AND I SAW THE 'POWER STEERING' LIGHT LIT.  I WAS EXTREMELY SHAKEN UP BY THIS INCIDENT AND CALLED MY DEALER, LOU BACHRODT CHEVROLET IN POMPANO BEACH.  THIS WAS A SUNDAY AND THE SERVICE DEPT. WAS CLOSED.  I SPOKE WITH A SALESMAN, ALEX, WHO LEFT A MESSAGE FOR JEREMY IN THE SERVICE DEPT.  I SPOKE WITH JEREMY EARLY MONDAY MORNING AND EXPLAINED TO HIM WHAT HAPPENED. I TOLD HIM MY HUSBAND DROVE THE CAR WHEN HE CAME HOME FROM WORK AND THE LIGHT WAS NOT ON AND THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING.  JEREMY SAID IT'S BECOMING A COMMON PROBLEM CALLED INTERMITTENT POWER STEERING FAILURE.  HE CHECKED MY VIN NUMBER AND SAID THERE WAS NO RECALL.  I AM VERY AFRAID TO DRIVE THE CAR SINCE JEREMY SAID THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.  HE SAID IT'S A MOTOR PROBLEM AND HAS TO BE REPAIRED.  I AM NOT PAYING FOR YET ANOTHER CHEVY PROBLEM.  I HAD THE IGNITION SWITCH REPLACED LAST YEAR.  THIS CAR IS MY TRANSPORTATION FOR WORK.  GM NEEDS TO STEP UP AND DO THE RIGHT THING AND RECALL ALL COBALTS FOR THIS PROBLEM.  THAT DAY I SENT AN EMAIL TO GM, BUT HAVE HEARD NOTHING.",

I WAS VERY UPSET AND FRUSTRATED, BUT I AM A COLLEGE STUDENT AND I WORK, SO I NEEDED MY CAR. I PAID THE $500 DOLLARS OUT OF CREDIT CARDS BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE THE MONEY FOR A MISTAKE THAT THEY MADE AND PEOPLE AT THE DEALERSHIP EVEN TOLD ME THEY DID BECAUSE THEY SAID THAT THE FILLER NECK IS PLASTIC AND THAT WITH THE WEATHER CHANGES IN HOUSTON WHEN \"HANDLED\" CAN CRACK EASILY. I THOUGHT IT WAS A TOTAL FRAUD AND I WANT MY $500 DOLLARS BACK AND ALSO THE FEE THEY CHARGED TO CHECK IT WHICH WAS ALMOST $85 DOLLARS.   *TR",

I FIND THIS IRONIC SINCE MY WARRANTY RECENTLY RAN OUT.  THE TIMING CHAIN JUMPED AND BENT THE VALVES.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS REPAIR AND IS VERY COSTLY.  I HAVE HAD EVERYTHING CHECK REGULARLY.  THERE WAS NO WARNING AND I NEARLY WRECKED MY CAR, AS I WAS DRIVING WHEN IT HAPPENED.  I RECENTLY RECEIVED ANOTHER RECALL FOR THE IGNITION SWITCH.  THE CAR WAS RECALLED BEFORE FOR A SIMILAR ISSUE.  PRIOR TO THE ENGINE ISSUES RECENTLY, I HAD NOTICED AN IGNITION AND STEERING PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, NOW I CANT EVEN MOVE THE CAR TO GET THE RECALL ISSUE RESOLVED.  THIS VEHICLE WAS MY FIRST CAR, THE CAR IS NEARLY NEW AND WAS WHEN I BOUGHT IT.  THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.  ESPECIALLY SO CLOSE TO THE WARRANTY EXPIRATION AND WITH NO WARNING.  THERE WAS NO WAY TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING.  I WAS NOT AWARE THAT COBALTS HAD ZERO TOLERANCE.  THIS SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE.

ADDITIONALLY, THE FUEL INJECTOR WAS REPLACED AS WELL BECAUSE IT'S ALSO PART OF THAT RECALL AND THE ONE THAT WAS ON THE CAR WAS CRACKED AND LEAKING.

I'VE OWNED A NUMBER OF CARS IN THE PAST AND NONE OF THEM EVER FACED ANY TYPE OF RECALL WHATSOEVER. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I'M VERY UNHAPPY AND VERY UNIMPRESSED.  *TR",

I WAS CALLED BY ALLEGHENY GENERAL HOSPITAL (AGH) IN PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA TO INFORM ME THAT MY SON WAS TAKEN THERE BY HELICOPTER AND WAS UNRESPONSIVE.  HE WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT AND SUFFERED SEVERE BRAIN TRAUMA.  UNFORTUNATELY HE DIED ON FEBRUARY 29, 2008.      THIS WAS MY SON'S FIRST \"NEW\" VEHICLE.  WE PURCHASED IT ON 12/3/2007 AND HE DIED IN IT 2 MONTHS LATER.  THE VEHICLE IS A 2007 CHEVY COBALT.  THE ACCIDENT WAS INVESTIGATED AND THE POLICE BELIEVE MY SON FELL ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL AS HE CROSSED THE CENTER LINE OF A 2 LANE ROAD AND HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE.  THE PERSON IN THE OTHER VEHICLE SURVIVED.      AFTER RECEIVING THE FIRST RECALL NOTICE ABOUT THE IGNITION SWITCH ISSUE I CONTACTED THE CAR MANUFACTURER (GENERAL MOTORS) TO INQUIRE ABOUT WHETHER THEY WOULD INVESTIGATE THE VEHICLE TO DETERMINE IF IT WAS DEFECTIVE AND COULD HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT.  I WAS TOLD BY A GM REPRESENTATIVE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO AS THEY HAD FILED BANKRUPTCY.      I CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE RECALL NOTICES WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT MY SON'S DEATH IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CHEVY COBALT DEATHS.    I FIRST CONTACT THE US DEPT. OF JUSTICE AND GOT NOWHERE.  I THEN CONTACTED YOUR ORGANIZATION (NHTSA) - REFERENCE# 614104 AND WAS TOLD THAT I NEEDED TO GO BACK TO GM.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT BOTH ORGANIZATIONS ARE INVOLVED IN AN INVESTIGATION OF GM HOWEVER NOBODY AT EITHER ORGANIZATION SEEMS TO WANT TO TALK TO ME. I DON'T TRUST GM AFTER SOME READING I HAVE BEEN DOING HOWEVER I PLAN TO MAKE THAT CALL.  THIS IS RELIVING A NIGHTMARE!  *TR",

I CONSULTED THE CHEVROLET DEALER AND WAS TOLD RECALL WAS ONLY EFFECTIVE FOR COBALT VEHICLES SOLD IN CERTAIN SOUTHERN STATES.  SINCE I HAD TO PAY TO HAVE FUEL PUMP REPLACED, I HAD PUMP REPLACED BY AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC.  I PHONED CHEVROLET NATIONAL REP IN DECEMBER, 2012, TO QUESTION WHY FUEL PUMP WAS ONLY BEING RECALLED IN 'HOT WEATHER' STATES WHEN TEMPERATURES WERE CONSISTENTLY IN THE 90'S IN THE CHICAGO AREA IN THE SUMMER OF 2012.  I WAS TOLD THAT CHEVROLET WAS LOOKING INTO THE MATTER AND WOULD LET ME KNOW THEIR DECISION BY THE END OF JANUARY, 2013.  OF COURSE, I NEVER HEARD FROM NATIONAL CHEVY REP OR CHEVY DEALER I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM.  I AM FILING THIS COMPLAINT BECAUSE I FEEL THAT ISSUING A RECALL FOR ONLY CERTAIN STATES IS UNFAIR (DISCRIMINATORY?), ESPECIALLY SINCE THE PUMP PROBLEM I HAD WITH MY VEHICLE WAS EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL NOTICE.  ALSO, IF THIS ISSUE IS RELATED TO WARM TEMPERATURE (CLIMATE) SITUATIONS, I BELIEVE THE TEMPERATURES IN THE CHICAGO AREA IN THE SUMMER OF 2012 WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY MET THAT REQUIREMENT.  AT MINIMUM, I AM REQUESTING REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE COST OF THE REPLACEMENT FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY @ $310.89.  IDEALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO BE REIMBURSED FOR THE TOTAL COST OF REPLACING THE PUMP, WHICH WAS $577.32.  LASTLY, I WOULD LIKE TO STATE THAT I'M NOTIFYING NHTSA OF THIS SITUATION BECAUSE IT IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.   WITH FUEL VISIBLY LEAKING FROM THE DEFECTIVE FUEL PUMP, THE CHANCE OF THE VEHICLE CATCHING FIRE FROM A SPARK OR IMPACT IS DANGEROUSLY ELEVATED.  I BELIEVE A NATIONWIDE RECALL ON ALL 2007 CHEVROLET COBALTS IS IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE CHANCE OF SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH OCCURRING FROM THIS SITUATION.  *TR",

I WENT HOME AND CHECKED ON LINE ABOUT GAS LEAKS ON A 2007 CHEVY COBALT AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON THESE MODEL CARS IN 2010. I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED ABOUT THIS DANGEROUS AND HAZARDOUS SITUATION. I ALSO LEARNED THAT THE STATE I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE(IN MARYLAND) WAS NOT ONE OF THE STATES FOR THE RECALL. I CALLED MY NEAREST CHEVROLET DEALER AND TOLD HIM OF THIS PROBLEM BUT I WAS INFORMED I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR MYSELF. THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!!! THE FUEL PUMP WAS CRACKED AND IT WAS THE MANUFACTURERS DEFECTED PART. A FUEL PUMP FOR THIS TYPE OF CAR SHOULD LAST AT LEAST 60,000 MILES. I BABYSIT FOR A LIVING AND THERE IS A SMALL CHILD IN MY VEHICLE ALMOST EVERYDAY. THIS COULD OF CAUSED SOMEONE TO LOSE THEIR LIVES OVER GM'S NEGLECT. WELL NEEDLESS TO SAY I PARKED MY CAR FOR 2 MONTHS UNTIL I HAD THE MONEY TO PAY FOR GM'S PROBLEM. SO NOW I AM OUT OF MONEY TO HAVE SOMETHING FIXED THAT WAS NO FAULT OF MY OWN. I FEEL GM SHOULD REIMBURSE  EVERYONE WHO HAD THIS PROBLEM REGARDLESS OF WHAT STATE THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED IN.

THE VEHICLE WAS THEN DIAGNOSED WITH AN EVAPORATIVE GAS LEAK, SO THE GAS CAP WAS REPLACED. AGAIN WE THOUGHT THAT THE ISSUE WAS CORRECTED UNTIL TWO WEEKS LATER MY DAUGHTER FILLED UP HER GAS TANK, AND WHEN SHE PARKED AT WORK SMELLED GAS STRONGLY AGAIN, AND THIS TIME NOTICED FLUID DRIPPING FROM UNDERNEATH THE CAR. THE NEXT DAY WE TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE MECHANIC, AND THIS TIME HE FOUND A CRACK IN THE PORT ASSEMBLY. HE REPAIRED IT WITH AN EPOXY REPAIR KIT TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY, BUT TOLD ME TO CHECK WITH GENERAL MOTORS TO SEE IF THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL OF ANY SORT.  I CHECKED WITH THE NHTSA AT SAFERCAR.GOV AND THERE IT WAS. THERE MOST DEFINITELY WAS A RECALL THAT WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED OF REGARDING THIS FUEL LEAK ISSUE.

THE PLASTIC SUPPLY OR RETURN PORT ON THE MODULAR RESERVOIR ASSEMBLY MAY CRACK. IF EITHER OF THESE PORTS DEVELOPS A CRACK, FUEL WILL LEAK FROM THE AREA.

THE CAR STEERED ITSELF AS I COULD NOT STEER IT, INTO A DEEP DRAINAGE DITCH. MY PASSENGER HEAD ALMOST WENT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, MY SAFETY BELT BRUISED MY NECK AND SHOULDER, PAINFULLY. MY PASSENGER WAS BLEEDING PROFUSELY, A PERSON STOPPED AND TOOK US FOR HELP. I WAS SO SHAKEN UP AND IT HAPPENED SO FAST, THAT I COULD NOT FIND MY CELL PHONE TO CALL 911. THE NEXT DAY MY GRANDFATHER WHO HELPED ME PAY FOR THE CAR, HAD THE CAR PUT ON A TRAILER AND STORED IN A COVERED SECURE AREA WHERE IT IS STILL STORED AND UNTAMPERED WITH. WE CONTACTED GM, IT HAS BEEN  OVER TWO MONTHS, WE JUST RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THEIR ATTORNEY. TO TOP THIS ALL OFF, I RECEIVED A RECALL LETTER TWO DAYS AFTER IT HAPPENED! AND THEN I WAS TOLD THAT MY INSURANCE DOES NOT HAVE COLLISION COVERAGE BUT ONLY COMPREHENSIVE. I WORK HARD AND GO TO COLLEGE FOR TWO MONTHS I HAVE BEEN PAYING FOR TAXES, OVER $35.00 PER DAY. I LOVED THIS CAR BUT NOW I WILL NOT RIDE IN ONE. I STILL HAVE NIGHT MARES ON THE CRASH.  I AM BEHIND IN MY BILLS. THANK YOU GM FOR NOT HELPING ME. I WISH TO HAVE THIS CAR EXAMINED. I CAN NOT AFFORD TO PAY SOMEONE TO INSPECT THE STEERING NOR CAN I PAY FOR AN ATTORNEY. YOUR HELP IS DESPERATELY NEEDED, AS MY GRANDFATHER BELIEVES THAT GM WILL DELAY THIS REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT. I HOPE YOU CAN HELP. ALSO THE AIR BAG NEVER DEPLOYED. THE CAR IS TOTALED. I CLEANED THE BLOOD WITH 3 BOTTLES OF HYDROGEN PEROXIDE TO SAVE THE LEATHER SEATS.

I HAD THOUGHT THAT MAYBE BECAUSE OF CITY DRIVING THESE PARTS HAD BEEN WORN OUT PREMATURELY. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH I FOUND HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS. ALMOST ALL  OF THEM CLAIM THAT THESE PROBLEMS WERE WITH CARS BOUGHT DIRECTLY OFF THE LOT. I KNOW 5 PEOPLE PERSONALLY WHO ALSO HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS.

THE MECHANIC DEPT. LOOKED UP HER VIN & SAID \"NO RECALL FOR THAT VIN # BUT YOU HAVE EXTENDED WARRANTY WE CAN FIX IT.\" SO, AT NO CHARGE IT WAS TAKEN CARE OF. THEN, A FEW WEEKS LATER I GET A RECALL FOR THE MRA TO BE REPLACED AS IT CAN BE DANGEROUS?! LETTER STATES THAT IF THERE IS A CRACK, FUEL CAN LEAK & THERE COULD BE A FIRE?!  BESIDES THE RECALL YOU HAVE JUST ISSUED FOR THE POWER STEERING \"WHY DON'T YOU MAKE SURE RECALLS ARE SENT OUT IN A TIMELY MANNER FOR  MRA PARTS IN COBALT'S AS WELL ESPECIALLY AS DANGEROUS AS IT CAN BE!!!

WELL WHEN WE GOT BACK IN THE CAR TO LEAVE IT WAS FINE AT FIRST, THEN IT STARTED IT AGAIN AND ALL THE WAY HOME. WE HAVE NOTICED THAT WHEN YOU TURN THE CAR OFF FOR A WHILE AND START IT BACK IT DOES OK FOR A LITTLE WHILE. WE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH IT EVERYDAY. ONCE THE POWER STEERING ACTS UP IT STAYS THAT WAY UNTIL YOU TURN THE CAR OFF AND LET IT COOL OFF BUT AFTER YOUR DRIVING IT AGAIN ITS STARTS ALL OVER. WE HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT YET AND HOPEFULLY WE DON'T. IT IS VERY HARD FOR ME TO DRIVE IT BUT I HAVE TO USE IT SOMETIME TO GO PLACES.WE HAVE NOT HAD IT FIXED YET AND WERE TOLD IT COULD COST ALOT TO GET IT FIXED. WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY NOW TO GET IT FIXED. ANOTHER COMPLAINT IS WELL ACTUALLY WAS THE GEAR SHIFT. IT WOULD NOT GO ALL THE WAY INTO PARK, I GUESS, AND YOU COULDN'T GET YOUR KEYS OUT OF THE IGNITION. WE HAVE ALREADY HAD THAT FIXED THOUGH. THERE ARE OTHER COMPLAINTS I HAVE BUT PROBABLY NOTHING THAT WOULD BE COVER UNDER SAFETY ISSUES. THIS CAR IS A LEMON IN MY BOOK. *TR",

(I LATER LEARNED THAT IT WAS ELECTRIC.)  THE POWER STEERING CONTINUED TO COME AND GO FOR ANOTHER FEW MONTHS.  I STOPPED DRIVING FOR ABOUT 8 WEEKS AND WHEN I RESUMED DRIVING, IT WAS FINE.  I THOUGHT MAYBE THE PROBLEM HAD FIXED ITSELF.  IT WENT OUT AGAIN ABOUT 6 WEEKS AGO; IT HAD AROUND 41500 MILE ON IT.  I LIVE IN THE BACK OF A NEIGHBORHOOD, WHERE I HAVE TO MAKE LOTS OF TURNS AND THAT IS GENERALLY WHERE IT GOES OUT.  I DO NOT DO A LOT OF INTERSTATE OR HIGHWAY DRIVING, MOSTLY JUST INNER-CITY.  I RARELY TRAVEL OVER 50 MPH.  BECAUSE THE POWER STEERING CONTINUES TO GO OUT, IT MAKES IT HARD FOR ME TO MAKE TURNS AND DRIVE.  I HAVE NOT YET BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY ACCIDENTS BECAUSE OF THE ISSUE, BUT I HAVE HAD SEVERAL CLOSE CALLS.  I TRY TO REMAIN EXTRA AWARE OF MY SURROUNDINGS TO PREVENT ANY INCIDENTS. *TR",

I DID SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AND FOUND THAT HUNDREDS.. MAYBE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE SAME CAR. MANY HAD PAID THE $2,000-$2,500 TO HAVE THIS MOTOR REPLACED ONLY TO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM REOCCUR WEEKS LATER. SO, I HAVE YET TO HAVE IT FIXED. TODAY I GOT A RECALL NOTICE FOR A FUEL PUMP ON THIS CAR, BUT CHEVY STILL REFUSES TO CORRECT THE FAULTY POWER ASSIST MOTOR WHICH ACTS AS THE POWER STEERING. ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOMEONE LOSING STEERING ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY AND DEATHS OCCUR. AS FOR MY CHEVY COBALT.. ITS PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY UNTIL I CAN FINISH PAYING IT OFF, AND THEN I'LL BE CALLING A JUNKYARD TO COME GET IT. JUST A THOUGHT... BUT ITS AMAZING HOW FOR ANY OTHER PRODUCT.. A DISHWASHER... A CHILD'S TOY.. IF A COMPANY SELLS A FAULTY PRODUCT, YOU CAN TAKE IT BACK TO THE STORE AND GET YOUR MONEY BACK LEGALLY... IF ITS A CAR, YOU'RE STUCK. *TR",

I TOLD HER TO CALM DOWN AND PULL OVER AND I WOULD BE THERE AS QUICKLY AS I COULD. WELL AFTER EXPLAINING TO AN OFFICER THAT STOPPED ME FOR SPEEDING, THE OFFICER AND I BOTH GOT TO MY DAUGHTER AND SURE ENOUGH, THE POWER STEERING DID FAIL ON HER. I PROCEEDED TO DRIVE THE CAR HOME CAREFULLY, AND EVER SINCE THEN THE STEERING HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM. I CAN'T UNLOAD THE CAR CAUSE I OWE $9000 ON IT. SO NOW I'M RESEARCHING TO REPLACE WHAT I NEED TO REPLACE ON THIS PIECE OF JUNK. I DO HEAR A CLICK UNDER THE DASH RIGHT WHEN THE STEERING GIVES OUT, SO I'M REPLACING BOTH THE POWER STEERING CONTROL MODULE AND THE ASSIST MOTOR. HERE'S HOPING THIS SOLVES THE PROBLEM. TO GM, I AM NEVER, EVER BUYING ANOTHER VEHICLE MADE BY YOU AGAIN!! MAY YOU MERCILESSLY GO OUT OF BUSINESS ONCE AND FOR ALL. WE COULD USE ANOTHER DOMESTIC CAR MAKER TO REPLACE YOUR INCOMPETENCE. *TR",

WAS SIMPLY TOLD THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PURCHASE NEW ROTORS. NO REMEDY APPEARS TO BE AVAILABLE TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM.

I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER TODAY (10/19) AND EXPLAINED THE CONCERN.  THEY AGREED  THAT IT WAS A PROBLEM AND ACTUALLY TESTED SEVERAL OTHER CARS (SAME MODEL) ON THE NEW CAR LOT AND FOUND THAT THEY ALL HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  THEY ALSO TESTED THE PASSENGER SIDE DOOR AND IT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  THEY SPOKE WITH THEIR REGIONAL REP AND WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS A \"KNOWN CHARACTERISTIC\" OF THE VEHICLE AND NOTHING COULD BE DONE TO FIX IT.  I THEN CALLED THE GENERAL MOTORS NATIONAL CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CENTER AND WAS TOLD EXACTLY THE SAME THING.  IN MY OPINION THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM SINCE THE CAR DOES NOT WARN YOU THAT THE DOOR IS NOT COMPLETELY CLOSED AND LATCHED AS IT SHOULD.  *NM",
