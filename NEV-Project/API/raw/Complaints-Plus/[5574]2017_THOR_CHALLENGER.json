The contact stated that while driving at 65 MPH, an abnormally loud banging sound was heard and another vehicle honked the contact, alerting him to look in the rearview mirror. The contact noticed styrofoam flying from the motorhome and the external compartment door flapping open. The contact pulled over and examined the RV and became aware that one of the external compartment door skin had separated from the glue. The contact used masking tape to tape the separated door compartment and four other door compartments that were starting to separate as well. The vehicle was not repaired by an independent mechanic or dealer. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure but informed the contact that the warranty had expired. The contact related the failure to NHTSA Campaign Number: 21V845000 (Structure) however, the VIN was not included in the recall. The failure mileage was 19,100.",

I IMMEDIATELY LOOKED IN THE LEFT HAND MIRROR, AND SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT DOOR, OPEN, FLAPPING IN THE BREEZE. I WAS APPROCHING EXIT236, SO I EXITED AND LOCATED A HOME DEPOT PARKING LOT JUST OFF THE EXIT. I PULLED INTO THE HOME DEPOT PARKING LOT AND UPON CHECKING THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT DOOR, FOUND THAT THE DOOR WAS SECURED. WHAT I SAW WAS IN FACT, THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT DOOR SKIN. I OBSERVED THAT THE DOOR SKIN HAD SEPARATED FROM THE FRAME. UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, NO MECHANICAL FASTENERS WE'RE LOCATED ON THE SKIN ,OR ON DOOR FRAME. I OBTAINED STAINLESS STEEL SELF DRILLING SHEET METAL SCREWS, FOLDED THE SKIN BACK INTO POSITION, AND SECURED IN PLACE WITH THE SCREWS, AND CONTINUED TO OUR DESTINATION WITHOUT FUTHER INCIDENT. CHECKED, AND FOUND NO OTHER DOORS AFFECTED.  UPON RETURN TO THE DEALERSHIP, APPROX 1 WEEK LATER, I CHECKED ALL DOORS, AND FOUND THE WATER TANK COMPARTMENT DOOR SKIN TO BE LOOSE, ALONG THE TOP OF THE LEADING EGDE. THIS DOOR WAS REMOVED, AND REATTACHED BY THE DEALERSHIP.  I CONTACTED THOR MOTORCOACH, ABOUT THIS POTENTIALLY SERIOUS MANUFACTURING DEFECT, AND WAS TOLD TO CONTACT MISHAWAKA SHEET METAL,  MANUFACTURERS OF THE DOORS IN QUESTION. I EMAILED MISHAWAKA SHEET METAL ON 05/02/17 AND RECEIVED A EMAIL FROM THEM ON 05/16/17 STATING THEY WERE AWARE OF PROBLEMS WITH SOME DOORS, AFTER BEING ASSEMBLED USING A BAD BATCH OF GLUE, WHICH CAUSES PROBLEMS AFTER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.  I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT THOR MOTORCOACH  WITH THIS INFORMATION,  WHICH APPARENTLY,  THEY WERE AWARE OF, AS THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW REPAIRED UNDER WARRANTY.   THERE ARE AT LEAST 8 OTHER OWNERS WITH COACHES EFFECTED. SHOULD THESE PANELS DETACH, IT COULD BE DEADLY !",

WHILE WE WERE PREPARING TO LEAVE, THE TRIMARK ENTRY DOOR LATCH BROKE LEAVING 3 PEOPLE TRAPPED INSIDE AND ME OUTSIDE.  I HAD TO CLIMB THROUGH A WINDOW USING A LADDER WITH TOOLS TO DISASSEMBLE THE LOCK AND PRY OUT THE BROKEN PLUNGER PART.  I HAVE ATTACHED A PICTURE THAT REPRESENTS THE PART OF THE LATCH THAT BROKE.  CURRENTLY, A DEADBOLT IS KEEPING THE DOOR CLOSE AND AM ALSO USING A VELCRO STRAP TO KEEP THE DOOR FROM OPENING WHILE TRAVELING.  SINCE IT HAS BEEN 14 MONTHS SINCE PURCHASING THE VEHICLE NEW, I AM OUT OF WARRANTY.  HOWEVER, AFTER DOING RESEARCH THE REPLACEMENT PART BEING OFFERED IS THE EXACT SAME MECHANISM THAT OTHERS HAVE INDICATED HAS THE SAME ISSUE AFTER THEY HAVE REPLACED, SOME MULTIPLE TIMES.   I HAVE CALLED THOR MOTORCOACH AND THEY KNEW EXACTLY THE ISSUE AND I WAS TOLD I WILL NEED TO BUY A NEW DOOR LATCH ASSEMBLY.  TRIMARK IS OFFERING A NEWER REPLACEMENT PART NUMBER 37575-01-K WITH A REDESIGNED STEEL PLUNGER AND CHARGING $201.  I DO NOT FEEL I SHOULD HAVE TO SPEND ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR A DESIGN FLAW THAT CAUSES A SAFETY ISSUE BY TRAPPING PEOPLE EITHER INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE.",
