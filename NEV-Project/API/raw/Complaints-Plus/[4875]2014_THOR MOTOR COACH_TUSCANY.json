I HAVE TEMPORARILY SUPPORTED THE STEP WITH A RIVET HOWEVER IT IS CURRENTLY NOT BRADED AND IS HELD IN PLACE WITH JB WELD.  I STEPPED OUT OF THE MOTORHOME AND THE STEP GAVE WAY AND I KEEP FROM FALLING BY HANGING ON TO THE HANDLE.  THIS HAPPENED AFTER WE PARKED IN THE RV PARK FOR THE EVENING.  IT APPEARS THAT THE RIVETS ARE TURNING CAUSING THE EXPANDED AREA TO GRIND OFF LETTING THE RIVETS TO WORK OUT.  A PERSON  CAN UNKNOWINGLY SLIP AND FALL WHEN THE STEPS GIVE WAY. *TT  *TR",
