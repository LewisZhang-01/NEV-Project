I HAD BEEN DRIVING FOR TWENTY MINUTES AND SMELLED A VERY POWERFUL GAS SMELL SINCE I STARTED DRIVING.  MY FOOT WAS ON THE GAS AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN THE ACCELERATION OF MY CAR INCREASED TO 45MPH.  I TRIED BREAKING TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN AND THE BREAK PEDAL RESISTED MY EFFORT.  I WAS ABLE TO SLOW TO 40MPH BUT NO LOWER.  WHEN I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE BREAK THE CAR ACCELERATED GREATLY.  DESPITE BREAKING,  THE SPEED KEPT INCREASING.  I FELT I HAD NO CONTROL OVER MY CAR.  I WAS TRAVELING FOR OVER A MILE AT SPEEDS REACHING 60MPH ON A 35MPH SPEED LIMIT.  I APPROACHED A RED LIGHT, LUCKILY IT TURNED GREEN THE MINUTE I WENT UNDER IT.  HAD IT NOT, I WOULD HAVE RUN THE RED LIGHT AT A BUSY INTERSECTION.

I RESEARCHED THE WEB AND SAW HUNDREDS OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE IGNITION SWITCH. MY IGNITION SWITCH GOT STUCK IN BOTH THE RUN AND LATER START POSITION. THE CAR WOULD NOT TURN OFF. ALSO IT CAUSED THE CLIMATE CONTROL NOT TO FUNCTION PROPERLY BY NOT TURNING ON, THE SCREEN WAS BLACK. UPON RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM, I SAW MANY OTHER 1998 AUDI OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. EVEN MORE SIMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAD A 1998 MODEL YEAR CAR THAT WAS MANUFACTURED IN 1997. THE RECALL CAMPAIGN # LE (00V-317) IS A LITTLE AMBIGOUS STATING MODEL YEARS AND MANUFACTURE DATES. MY CAR FALLS WITHIN THE MANUFACTURE DATE BUT NOT THE RECALL DATE. IT IS OBVIOUS TO ANY PRUDENT AND REASONABLE PERSON THAT CARS MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO AUGUST OF 1997 EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE MODEL YEAR 1998 HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. I SAW SOME RESPONES TO OTHER OWNERS REGARDING THIS SITUATION AND A RESOLVEMENT IN THE MATTER WITH AUDI INCLUDING US POOR OWNERS WHO BOUGHT A CAR IN THE SWITCH OF MODEL YEARS.
