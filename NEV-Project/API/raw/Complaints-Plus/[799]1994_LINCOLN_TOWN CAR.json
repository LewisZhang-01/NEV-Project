THE CAR WAS THEN TOWED 42 MILES TO MY HOME ON A FLATBED TRUCK AT THE COST OF $192.00.  WITH THE AID OF A NEIGHBOR (A PROFESSIONAL MECHANIC) THE BALL JOINT WAS REPLACED WITH AN AFTERMARKET PART,COST $52.00(NO LABOR COST-SELF INSTALLED).THE BROKEN BALL JOINT( I HAVE RETAINED THE BROKEN PART IN MY POSSESSION) DID NOT HAVE ANY FITTINGS FOR LUBRICATION,BUT ACCORDING TO FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE DIVISION IN DEARBORN MI( MR.PAUL LAFFIN ) MY VEHICLE WAS NOT PART OF ANY SAFETY RECALL(98S37 FORD'S # ) OR 98V322000.I WAS ADVISED THAT I SHOULD TAKE MY CAR TO THE NEAREST LINCOLN DEALER FOR INSPECTION AND OR SERVICE OF THE OTHER (RIGHT SIDE) BALL JOINT.  MY DRIVING TO AND FROM WORK INVOLVES 15 MILES ON AN INTERSTATE HIGHWAY,I GUESS I WAS JUST LUCKY TO HAVE THIS FAILURE OCCUR ON A CITY STREET AT 20 MPH.  I AM VERY DISSATISFIED WITH FORD,LINCOLN FOR THEIR RESPONSE  TO MY ISSUE WHICH I BELIEVE IS A DEFECTIVE PART THAT THEY REFUSE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR AND CORRECT.  EVEN IF MY CAR WAS NOT IN THE ORIGINAL RECALL, I FEEL IT IS A SIMILAR ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN A LIKE MANNER WHEN IT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO THEIR ATTENTION.

APPARENTLY, IT EXPIRED IN NOV. 2001. SO FAR WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH 3 DIFFERENT FORD REPRESENTATIVES AND ALL HAVE GIVEN US CONFLICTING REPORTS. WE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THE DAMAGE IS COMMON, AS OUTLINED IN YOUR TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (ARTICLE NO. 98-4-9) AND THAT THE VEHICLE IS UNDER THE RECALL CAMPAIGN # 00M09 WE ARE ASKING THAT YOU AUTHORIZE OUR LOCAL FORD DEALER TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE UNDER THE WARRANTY. PLEASE RESPOND WITH A DECISION BY FRIDAY 2/8/02.  *AK    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
