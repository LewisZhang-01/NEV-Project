I RAISED THE BUCKET UP UNTIL THE CABINET WAS ABOUT 4 INCHES OFF THE TRUCK BED. I GOT OFF THE LOADER AND PROCEEDED TO DRIVE MY TRUCK FORWARD OUT FROM UNDER THE CABINET.

THE ENGINE WAS RUNNING AND I PUT THE TRUCK IN PARK ( THE PARK DASH LIGHT CAME ON) AND I GOT OUT. I WALKED TOWARD THE LOADER CAB. WHEN I WAS HALFWAY THERE, THE PICKUP TRUCK ROLLED BACKWARD, HITTING THE CABINET WHICH WAS SUSPENDED FROM THE LOADER STOPPING THE TRUCK.
