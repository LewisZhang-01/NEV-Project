        "summary": "THE PROBLEM OCCURS WHEN YOU SLOW DOWN- LIKE FOR A TURN, BUT DO NOT COME TO A COMPLETE STOP. THE DCT TRANSMISSION SEEMS TO HAVE TROUBLE FIGURING OUT WHAT GEAR TO SELECT BECAUSE WHEN YOU STEP ON THE GAS TO ACCELERATE, THERE IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN THE ONSET OF POWER- UP TO 2-3 SECONDS. BY THIS TIME, THE DRIVER IS USUALLY REALLY DIGGING INTO THE THROTTLE. THE TRANSMISSION FINALLY PICKS A GEAR, WHICH RESULTS IN THE CAR SUDDENLY LURCHING FORWARD, SOMETIMES INVOKING THE ANTI-SKIP CONTROL.     THE DANGER IN THIS BEHAVIOR OCCURS WHEN MAKING A TURN INTO ON-COMING TRAFFIC AFTER SLOWING DOWN TO AROUND 10-15 MPH. AFTER THE TURN, THE CAR IS POSITIONED IN THE TRAFFIC LANE, BUT YOU HAVE NO POWER TO ACCELERATE INTO THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC. THE ONCOMING CARS ARE NOW CLOSING IN ON YOUR CAR AT A FAST RATE, AND YOU'RE BASICALLY STUCK. THIS SITUATION IS MOST PRONOUNCED IN THE \"AUTO\" MODE OF THE DCT TRANSMISSION, BUT ALSO OCCURS TO A LESSER DEGREE WHILE IN THE MANUAL MODE WHEN YOU SELECT SECOND GEAR IN PREPARATION FOR THE TURN. IT IS ALSO VERY REPEATABLE IN BOTH MODES.    THESE PROBLEMS STARTED OCCURRING AFTER A PREVIOUS RECALL ON THIS TRANSMISSION WHERE THE ENGINE WOULD STALL UNDER HARD BRAKING OR NOT SHIFT UNDER HARD BRAKING. THE RECALL FIXED THAT PROBLEM, BUT INTRODUCED THIS PROBLEM, WHICH OCCURS ALMOST EVERY DAY WHEREAS THE PREVIOUS PROBLEM ONLY OCCURRED DURING A SPECIFIC SITUATION.  *TR",
