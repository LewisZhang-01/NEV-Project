SHE HAD TO BLOCK AN EXIT IN ORDER TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE OTHER VEHICLES.   THE TRUCK WENT TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP IN CUMBERLAND, MD WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT IT WAS THE EXHAUST TEMPERATURE SENSOR. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE ON THIS VEHICLE. AT NO TIME SHOULD A VEHICLE SHUTDOWN ON SOMEONE DRIVING IT. BELIEVE IT A VEHICLE GOING INTO A LIMP MODE BUT AT LEAST YOU CAN STILL DRIVE IT SO YOU CAN GET TO A SAFE PLACE.   THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHY THIS OCCURS AND ENFORCE FORD TO ISSUE A RECALL TO FIX THIS PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE IS INJURED OR KILLED.  *TR",

LOOKS AS THOUGH A RECALL WAS ISSUED FOR 2012 FORD 6.7L AMBULANCE PACKAGES:  F-350  ENGINE  RECALL NUMBER: 13V535000  RECALL DATE: 10/30/2013    PROBLEM SUMMARY:  FORD MOTOR COMPANY (FORD) IS RECALLING CERTAIN MODEL YEAR 2011-2012 F-350/450/550 AMBULANCE PACKAGE VEHICLES MANUFACTURED FEBRUARY 22, 2010, THROUGH OCTOBER 19, 2012 AND EQUIPPED WITH A 6.7L DIESEL ENGINE. DUE TO AN EXHAUST SENSOR PROBLEM, THE VEHICLES MAY EXPERIENCE LOSS OF POWER FOLLOWED BY AN ENGINE STALL.    CONSEQUENCE:  AN UNEXPECTED ENGINE STALL INCREASES THE RISK OF A CRASH. ADDITIONALLY, IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR WHEN THE AMBULANCE IS TRANSPORTING A PATIENT, THERE IS AN INCREASED RISK OF INJURY TO THE PATIENT.    CORRECTIVE ACTION:  FORD WILL NOTIFY OWNERS, AND DEALERS WILL REPLACE THE EXHAUST GAS TEMPERATURE SENSOR, FREE OF CHARGE. THE RECALL IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN BY THE END OF NOVEMBER 2013. OWNERS MAY CONTACT FORD MOTOR COMPANY CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP CENTER AT 1-866-436-7332. FORD'S RECALL CAMPAIGN NUMBER IS 13S10.    SURE IF A CRASH CAN RESULT IN THE VEHICLE SHUTTING DOWN ON A 6.7L, IT COULD ALSO OCCUR ON A 6.4L 2008 FORD F350 SUPER DUTY THAT IS NOT AN AMBULANCE PACKAGE. A CRASH IS WHAT ALMOST HAPPEN WHEN MY WIFE'S VEHICLE SHUTDOWN ON HER DUE TO THE SENSOR GOING OUT HEADING DOWN HILL WITH NO POWER STEERING.     INVESTIGATE THIS AND HAVE FORD HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I HAVE EMAILED FORD ON SEVERAL OCCASSIONS AND THIS IS THEIR LATEST RESPONSE:  OUR RECORDS INDICATE THAT YOU CONTACTED THE FORD CRC ON 9/30/14, AND OUR CUSTOMER CARE REPRESENTATIVE ADVISED YOU THAT WE HAVE DOCUMENTED YOUR COMMENTS WHICH WILL BE FORWARDED TO THE APPROPRIATE DEPARTMENT FOR REVIEW AND CONSIDERATION.
