THIS PARTICULAR PART SELDOM WORE OUT UNLESS IT WAS FACTORY DEFECTIVE, I FELT BETTER.  NOT BECAUSE OF THE DEFECT ITSELF, BUT TO KNOW THAT MY COMPLAINT FOR ALL THESE YEARS HAD NOT BEEN A FIGMENT OF MY IMAGINATION, JUSTIFIED MY COMPLAINTS TO THE MANUFACTURER. I KNOW THE CAR IS OLD AS I HAVE BEEN REMINDED OF MORE TIMES THAN I CARE TO MENTION.  MUST KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER CONSUMERS THAT WENT THROUGH THIS SAME ORDEAL.
