Local Ford dealer informed consumer this was a recall and they could fix it. Two week later,  consumer got the recall in the mail.

AN ALERT APPEARED ON THE DASHBOARD \"ANTI-COLLISION ALERT\" FLASHED ON THE DASH AND DISAPPEARED. THEN ANOTHER MESSAGE APPEARED \"DRIVE MODE NOT AVAILABLE\".  AN ORANGE WRENCH INDICATOR LIGHT LIT AT THE BOTTOM OF DASHBOARD NEXT TO THE ODOMETER.  THE VEHICLE WAS NOT SHIFTING CORRECTLY AND AS WE DROVE FURTHER, THE CAR SHIFTED THROUGH THE GEARS SLOWLY AND SLOWLY AND GRADUALLY. WE DROVE THE VEHICLE STRAIGHT TO THE BELL FORD DEALERSHIP IN PHOENIX.  WE DROPPED THE VEHICLE OFF AT THE DEALERSHIP.  THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT CALLED ME THE NEXT DAY AND SAID THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE. I HAD DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED TO US, BUT THEY SAID NOTHING WAS RECORDED IN THE VEHICLE DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM OR BLACK BOX. WE HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR OVER 3 WEEKS NOW AND THEY HAVE HAD THEIR MECHANIC DRIVING THE VEHICLE AND SAID THEY ARE UNABLE TO REPLICATE THE ISSUE.  WE DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN THE VEHICLE NOW. WE ARE NOT SURE WHAT TO DO NOW AS THE DEALERSHIP SAYS IT IS NOT ELIGIBLE UNDER THE LEMON LAW FOR A BUYBACK.",
