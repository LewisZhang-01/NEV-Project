At random times, while at a stop, reversing, doing a u-turn or changing gears, I step on the accelerator and it will not move. I have pushed all the way down on the accelerator and it won't budge for about 10 seconds, until then, it will just throw itself at a really high speed. There is no warning or light on the dashboard stating something is wrong. It does it at random times. There have been numerous times were I have been put at risk of a car accident because of this issue. Once, I was at a green light waiting to make a left, and when I had a chance to turn before the oncoming cars, I went for it, only to have the accelerator not work and go REALLY slowly (as if it was on neutral). At that speed, I was midway and the oncoming car was honking at me as it was getting closer. I kept stepping on the accelerator and nothing would happen. Luckily, a few seconds later it threw itself to a really high speed and I was able to make it before the oncoming car hit me. I have taken it to the dealer, only to find out I would be charged $169 for a diagnostics test and even then they wouldn't guarantee anything because it doesn't have any kind of warning light on the dashboard. The dealer then stated it could possibly be the transmission or throttle body. How is it possible for me to waste so much money on something the dealer itself is so unsure of the results? How can they guarantee they can fix the issue without happening again and possibly getting into an accident? I have heard of other Altima owners who have been told it is the transmission and they change it, only to have the same problems all over again. This issue really needs to be looked at before it gets more serious and cause devastating accidents. Thankfully it has not done that to me on the fwy yet.",

As I approached a stop sign and stop my car it was still acting normal. However, as i accelerated to take my turn i notice that my car wasn\u2019t moving normal it didn\u2019t accelerate pass 15 mph but the RPM was going up it went up to 5k RPM with no speed change it felt like i was on neutral. (No, I wasn\u2019t in neutral) it was on D i even placed the car in Ds to see if the problem was only on drive but the same problem occurred on Ds. As soon as i noticed that the car wasn\u2019t accelerating and after the person who was driving behind me got mad i moved my car to the break down lane. I powered cycled the car (turn it off and back on) and it was functioning correctly. My friend had the same problem occur to his car which is   Answer to Question: 1)I don\u2019t know which specific part is the problem. I do know this isn\u2019t the first case the same problem occurred on a 2015 Nissan Altima S i have a 2016 Nissan Altima S. This happened to the other car a few months prior to the date of my incident which happened August 30, 2021 at approximately 5pm.  Yes, it\u2019s available for inspection upon request.  2)My safety was put at risk because I couldn\u2019t accelerate properly to turn my car so I basically slowly cruised into traffic luckily i was able to steer to the side of the road. 3)No, it has not been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer. The problem is it happened suddenly with no warning of any problems. I only have 75k highway miles on the car with no lights, no accidents, only 5 years old and is in great shape. What makes it difficult to be reproduced is the fact that the problem randomly occurs and when the car goes through a power cycle the problem disappears and reoccurs randomly. 4)There were no warning lights and no problem prior to the car and it first occurred August 30, 2021 at approximately 5pm.",

She fears she will be rear ended or hit trying to make a turn. I talked to my local Nissan dealer today 8/19/2021 while having the hood latch recall done. The dealership didn't know anything about this problem with this  or other Altimas but said it could be the valve body in the transmission ( without looking at the car, just my conversation) MMMMMMM.  The dealership said they would charge me $130.00 to do a diagnostic check but without a check engine light it would not show anything and of course the car was doing fine when I went to there. This problem is sporadic and you don't  know when it will occur again and can be very dangerous.

I can push the pedal all the way to the floor and nothing happens. Then it will suddenly take off. This is a hazard while trying to turn out into traffic, if I would have to accelerate out of the way of a vehicle approaching me from any angle while at a stoplight or stop sign. Trying to cross intersections that only have 2 way stops, and for many other reasons that are pretty self explanatory. This sits very uneasy with me especially when my wife and child are riding with me.  I brought this up to the dealer and they found no codes and could not recreate it, but did reprogram my ecm to most current programming per NTB13-054D. That cost $140 and did not fix my issue.     It seems like to recreate the issue the car has to be driven for a little while (at lease 20-30 mins on the highway) before it begins acting up.

Then i got my car to go and i had to gain enough speed to make it over the overpass without stalling again. When i finally got tje car home my husband had it put in shop tw next day. Mechanic hooked it up to a machine and the codes for transmission popped up. My life was at risk as i had no oter choice but to play rush and roulette. Li",

I felt like I did not have control of the car and feared I was going to hit someone or be hit by someone.  I was finally able to get the car pulled over to the shoulder and turned it off.  I thought it was a bad tank of gas.  Let it sit for a bit, restarted, and made it home. We ran it this way for a couple of days so we could run the 'bad' gas out.  Filled back up and added additive. Nope, same issue as soon as the car gets warmed up after about 8-10 miles. Took it to my local mechanic to make sure it was not the Mass Air Flow Sensor that I had to pay him to replace a few months back which cost me $600.  That came back fine, but he informed me it was the transmission, and is a known issue with Nissans.  I began researching, and boy is it ever a known issue all the way back to 2013.  What baffles me is they are still using this same transmission, and one day, this will cause someone to get killed because they are allowed to continue doing this.  I took it to Nissan Dealership, and opened a case with Nissan HQ Consumer Affairs.  They confirmed CVT Transmission.  I am at 88,500 miles, warranty out at 84,000.  They offered to pay 80% for repair. Not acceptable when this should be a recall.  Please have this recalled for goodness sake before someone is hurt.

I WAS ALMOST HIT BY AN 18 WHEELER THAT BARE HAD ENOUGH TIME AND SPACE TO SWERVE AND GO AROUND ME. THIS COULD'VE EASILY BEEN A FATAL ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF A FAULTY CVT TRANSMISSION THAT NISSAN KNOWS ABOUT BUT REFUSES TO CORRECT. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND AS EXPECTED THEY SUGGESTED REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION WHICH IS A $5,000 OR MORE REPAIR. SO I CONTACTED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS IN HOPE OF GETTING SOME ASSISTANCE FROM NISSAN SINCE THE VEHICLE IS A 2016 WITH ONLY A LITTLE OVER 100K MILES. AND LIKE I'VE READ ON SO MANY OTHER FORUMS AND COMPLAINTS, NISSAN REFUSED TO OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE. THEY WOULD RATHER RISK SOMEONE BEING INJURED OR KILLED WHEN THESE CARS JUST RANDOMLY STOP PULLING WHILE TRAVELING ON THE ROAD IN TRAFFIC. I'VE OWNED SEVERAL OTHER NISSANS, AND EVERY ONE WITH THE CVT HAD THIS PROBLEM, I SHOULD'VE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO PURCHASE ANOTHER PIECE OF JUNK NISSAN BUT I GAVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND TOOK A CHANCE TO ONLY BE IN THE SAME SITUATION WITH A BAD CVT TRANSMISSION. MY THINK IS NISSAN KNOWS THIS IS A PROBLEM AND HAS BEEN A PROBLEM OF THEY'VE HAD SINCE THEY WENT TO THE CVT TRANSMISSION BUT THEY WON'T OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE OR REPAIR THE ISSUE. EVEN THE LADY THAT I SPOKE TO AT CONSUMER AFFAIRS SAID SHE HAD THE SAME ISSUE. NISSAN DID HAVE A CLASS ACTION SUIT FILED AGAINST THEM FOR THIS WHERE THEY EXTENDED THE TRANSMISSION WARRANTY TO 84K MILES BUT THEY'RE PROBLEMS USUALLY START RIGHT AFTER 84K MILES. I KNOW SOME WILL SAY 100K OUT A TRANSMISSION IS GOOD BUT I DISAGREE, IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE COMPETITORS LIKE HONDA AND TOYOTA'S, THEY'RE DRIVETRAINS SURPASSES THE NISSANS BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES. I OWN A 2013 HONDA ACCORD WITH THE CVT, IT'S AT 265K MILES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO ISSUES.",

FIRST: I WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT IN WHICH A REGULAR TRUCK HAULING AN ENCLOSED TRAILER DROVE OVER A LARGE PIECE OF PLYWOOD ON THE INTERSTATE AT 70MPH IN FRONT OF ME (ALSO GOING ABOUT 70 MPH) CAUSING THE PIECE OF PLYWOOD TO RAISE OFF OF THE ROAD AFTER HE CLEARED IT AND IT FLEW INTO THE FRONT OF MY VEHICLE AND BOUNCED UP ONTO THE HOOD AND THEN HIT THE ROOF BEFORE FLYING OFF OF MY CAR. DURING THIS PROCESS, PIECES OF THE PLYWOOD BECAME STUCK IN THE GRILL AREA OF MY CAR. THERE WERE NO INJURIES, THANKFULLY, BUT I AM CONCERNED THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.     SECOND: I'VE HAD THIS CAR SINCE JULY OF 2019. OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS I HAVE NOTICED THAT WHEN I PRESS THE GAS, THE RPMS RISE BUT THE TRANSMISSION TAKES A BIT TO SHIFT INTO GEAR CAUSING A LAG IN ACCELERATION. I HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT IF I AM AT A LIGHT OR A STOP AND SHIFT INTO DRIVE SPORT, IT DOESN'T DO THIS. I HAVE GOTTEN IN THE HABIT OF SHIFTING INTO THE SPORT MODE WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A STOP SIGN OR RED LIGHT.     THIRD: MY DAUGHTER WAS HIT TODAY BY A TRUCK CROSSING LANES TO TURN IN FRONT OF HER. SHE WAS TRAVELING AT APPX 35 MPH. THE TRUCK HIT MY PASSENGER SIDE FRONT AREA, DESTROYING MY HEADLIGHT, BUMPER, AND GRILL. IT WAS HIT HARD AND THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. THE SEATBELT DID NOT LOCK, CAUSING HER TO BOUNCE FORWARD AND SMACK HER HEAD ON THE STEERING WHEEL. I AM CONCERNED NOW ABOUT THE SEATBELTS AND AIRBAGS AND AM MORE WORRIED THAT THEY ARE DEFECTIVE AFTER READING OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THESE SAME ISSUES.

SERVICE MANAGER AS WELL AS A COUPLE SERVICE PEOPLE CAME OUT TO TALK TO ME AND TOLD ME THIS IS DEFINATELY A NISSAN DEFECT AND THE SUNROOF AND PAINT WOULD BE COVERED.  AFTER A FEW DAYS WITH NO WORD I WENT TO THE DEALER (THEY DID GIVE ME A COURTESY VEHICLE).  WHEN I WENT TO CHECK ON MY CAR THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THE SUNROOF WAS IN.  I AGAIN TOLD HIM I NEED TO KNOW IF ALL INCLUDING PAINT IS COVERED.  I HAD OPENED A CLAIM WITH MY INSURANCE BEFORE I CALLED NISSAN AND I DID NOT CLOSE THAT CLAIM UNTIL I KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.  NISSAN WENT AHEAD AND PUT IN THE SUNROOF.  TOLD ME AGAIN PAINT WOULD BE COVERED.  TWICE THEY SAID IT WAS DONE.  TWICE REFUSED BECAUSE PAINT WAS NOT TOUCHED.

TURN IT OFF AND BACK ON AND I STARTED DRIVING SGAIN IT SEEMED LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED BUT AFTER ABOUT 10 LATER IT COMPLETELY LOST POWER NO MATTER HOW HARD I PRESSED THE GAS. SO I CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND WE TOOK TO THE REPAIR SHOP AND I FOUND OUT THAT THE TRANSMISSION ON MY CAR HAS DIED AND IT WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED. AND THAT WILL COST ME ALOT OF MONEY. SO I CALLED A NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME IT WILL. COST ME $3000 FOR NEW TRANSMISSION. SO MY NEXT OPTION WAS TO CHECK WITH NISSAN IF THEY WILL HELP ME SO I CALLED THE NISSAN CUSTOMER SERVICE SO THEY ASKED HOW MUCH MILES I HAD IN THE CAR AND I TOLD THEM 70,000 MILES. BUT SADLY THEY TOLD ME MY WARRANT END AT 60,000 MILES. I NEED MY CAR FOR WORK SO AT THE END IT TOOK ABOUT A WEEK TO GET IT FIXED AND COSTED ME AROUND $2000. WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH WITH THIS CAR. WHAT SURPRISED ME IS THAT I ALWAYS TOOK GOOD CARE OF IT SINCE THE FIRST TIME I GOT IT I MADE SURE ALL MAINTENANCE THAT WAS NEEDED FOR IT WAS DONE BUT I WAS SURPRISED THAT MY TRANSMISSION DIED AT ONLY 70,000 MILES.

I TOOK THE CAR TO NISSAN AND THEY DID A DIAGNOSTIC TEST FOR $125 WHICH LED THEM TO SAY THAT THE VALVE BODY NEEDS TO BE REPLACED OR THE CAR NEEDS A NEW CVT. THE DEALERSHIP REQUEST ANOTHER $400 TO INSPECT THE TRANSMISSION TO SEE WHICH WAY IT COULD BE FIXED. ($1100 VALVE BODY AND $4000 CVT REPLACED. THIS IS VERY COSTLY AND A 2016 CAR SHOULD NOT NEED A TRANSMISSION. THERE IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH NISSAN'S CVT THAT I WAS NOT AWARE OF UNTIL NOW. AMONG OTHER THINGS THE SERVICE ADVISOR ADVISED THAT THIS JUST HAPPENS. WELL IT SHOULD NOT JUST HAPPEN IN A 3 YEAR OLD CAR.",

TO SHORTEN A LONG STORY AFTER I STOP USING THE CRUISE CONTROL, THE ISSUE REMAINED.  I'M GOING TO GO MORE IN DEPTH ABOUT THE ISSUE. FOR EXAMPLE, I AM STOPPED AT THE STOP LIGHT. WHEN THE LIGHT TURNS GREEN, I ACCELERATE NOTHING HAPPENS FOR A FEW SECONDS THERE'S A DELAY FOR ABOUT FOUR TO 5 SECONDS AND THEN ACCELERATION COMMENCES IN THE RPMS GO WAY UP. AT THIS TIME I HAVE TO LET UP OFF THE EXCELERATOR AND EASE INTO ACCELERATION NOW.  EVERY TIME I GO TO ACCELERATE THE RPMS GO WAY UP THE TRANSMISSION DOES NOT WANT TO GO INTO THE NEXT GEAR. I HAVE TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TURN OFF THE CAR TO RE-BOOT IT.  MOST OF THE TIME THIS WORKS SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T. SO ABOUT A WEEK AGO I WAS DRIVING HAVING THE SAME ISSUE AND THEN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON. NOW I HAVE CODES  TO TAKE TO THE DEALERSHIP. WHEN I TAKE THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR DIAGNOSTICS, TRANSMISSION RELATED CODES COME UP AND NOW THE CAR NEEDS A NEW TRANSMISSION.  WHEN I PURCHASED THIS CAR IT WAS ABOUT 49,000 MILES ON IT. I STARTED HAVING THIS ISSUE WELL BEFORE I GOT TO 60,000 MILES. 60,000 MILES IS THE CUT OFF FOR NISSAN'S POWERTRAIN WARRANTY. IF I HAD GOTTEN THE CODES BEFORE 60,000 MILES, IT WOULD BE COVERED ON UNDER NISSAN'S WARRANTY. MY GIRLFRIEND CHECKED ON CAR COMPLAINTS.COM AND NOTICED THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER NISSAN OWNERS WITH THE SAME ISSUE. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN INVESTIGATION FOR RECALL ON THIS MATTER.

I THEN SLAMMED THE BRAKES DOWN FIRMLY, STILL NOTHING, THE ABS DID NOT ENGAGE AT ALL. I SWERVED TO MY RIGHT TO TRY AND AVOID HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME HEAD ON. I CAUGHT IT'S RIGHT HAND BACK FENDER, BOTH FRONT AIR BAGS DEPLOYED, THE IMPACT OF HITTING THE MERCEDES STOPPED MY CAR- BOTH AIRBAGS INFLATED. MY 90LB, 18 YEAROLD SON WAS SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. I BROUGHT IT UP TO NISSAN ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS WAS ON AND OFF WHEN MY SON SAT IN THE FRONT SEAT. ON THE FIRST OCCASION NISSAN JUST RESET THE PASSENGER AIRBAG SENSOR. IT DID NOT SOLVE THE ISSUE, THE SECOND COMPLAINT, NISSAN SAID IT WOULD ONLY GO OFF IF MY SON WEIGHED OVER 110LBS. IN THIS ACCIDENT THE AIR BAG DID GO OFF, CONSIDERING THIS CAR WAS GOING TO BE THE CAR HE DROVE- HE HAS HIS PERMIT RIGHT NOW, SO IF THE DRIVER WEIGHS LESS THAN 110LBS IT WOULD NOT DEPLOY. IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE.    SECONDLY, I BELIEVE THE NISSAN ALTIMA BRAKES FAILED IN THE ACCIDENT.

IT IS VERY HARD TO SEE WHEN IT IS RAINING AND IT IS SCARY.  I HAVE OWNED 2 OTHER NISSAN'S, A 2007 ALTIMA AND A 2011 ALTIMA AND HAVE NEVER HAD THIS ISSUE.  IT SEEMS LIKE THE WIPER BLADE IS NOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE WINDSHIELD TO CLEAR IT PROPERLY.  I MENTIONED IT AT THE DEALERSHIP AND THE SERVICEMAN SAID THEY HAVE HAD OTHER COMPLAINTS BUT NO RECALL.  I ASKED IF HE THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP TO REPLACE THEM AND HE SAID THERE WAS NO GUARANTEE.  WE WERE IN PANAMA CITY, FL LAST WEEKEND AND HAD OUR SON-IN-LAW AND GRANDCHILD WITH US AND IT STARTED POURING RAIN.  WE COULD BARELY SEE, THEY WERE TRYING TO LOOK OUT THE SIDE WINDOWS TO SEE HOW TO STAY  ON THE ROAD.  IF THE WIPERS WOULD CLEAR THE WINDSHIELD PROPERLY THIS WOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE.  WE WERE ALL SCARED TO DEATH.  WE WERE BARELY MOVING AND WAS RIGHT AT OUR CONDO.  IT WOULD BE NICE IF A RECALL COULD TAKE PLACE TO ADJUST OR REPAIR THIS ISSUE.  THE WIPERS WON'T EVEN CLEAR A BUG OFF THE WINDSHIELD IF YOU WET IT WITH WIPER FLUID AND TRY TO RINSE IT OFF.  THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS.  PLEASE HELP.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.  *TR",
