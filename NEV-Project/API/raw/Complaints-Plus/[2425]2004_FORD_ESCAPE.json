        "summary": "The body panel around the rear driver side shock mount has almost completely rusted away. Driving one day, I started to hear a loud clunking noise from the rear driver side. It started to get louder the more I drove it. Upon inspection, I found the body panel had completely rusted around the shock mount tower, which is only now connected to the rear floor panel. Without the support of the rest of the body panel, the metal is slowing ripping away where it is connected to the floor if it is driven. The vehicle is completely unsafe to drive now as the rear shock could rip away from the vehicle at any moment. There have been many complaints of this happening on the rear passenger side, which I also had on this vehicle. Roughly 5 years ago, I had an independent auto body shop repair rust on the passenger side shock mount/body panel where it had rusted through. I noticed a hole in the body panel when changing the rear shocks, but it was not large enough or bad enough at that point to create a safety issue. So, I had time to safety get it to an auto body shop for repair before it got bad. This same issue has now happened on the driver side and I am left with a car that is unsafe to drive. When the other side was repaired, there was no sign of rust or concern on the other side. So, it has completely rusted through in that 5-year time frame. I inquired about repairing this with an auto body shop, and I was told that the rust is too significant to repair safely and cost effectively. It would require extensive metal repair on the body and frame underneath it. This absolutely could have put myself,  my passengers, and other drivers at risk if the rear shock and mount had unexpectedly ripped away from the body of the vehicle. It could have ripped through the rear body of the car or come in contact with the rear wheel while driving, causing a significant risk of losing control of the vehicle.",

THIS WOULD OCCUR INTERMITTINGLY WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS IN PARK AND OTHER TIMES WHILE DRIVING IN TRAFFIC.  I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE INTO TWO DIFFERENT MECHANICS AND THEY COULD NOT PROPERLY DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE STALLING ISSUE.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT NO LONGER COMES ON, BUT THE STALLING PROBLEM KEEPS GETTING WORSE.      MY SPOUSE NO LONGER DRIVES THE VEHICLE BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY ISSUES OF STALLING ON THE HIGHWAYS AND IT STORE PARKING LOTS.  ON JULY 21, 2016, I DROVE THE ESCAPE FOR A 200 MILE ROUND-TRIP.  DURING THE FIRST 100 MILES, GOING TO THE DESTINATION, THE VEHICLE RAN GREAT WITHOUT A SINGLE PROBLEM.  UNFORTUNATELY, DURING THE RETURN TRIP HOME, I BECAME SCARED AS THE VEHICLE BEGAN INTERMITTENTLY STALLING IN 4 LANES OF INTERSTATE TRAFFIC THAT WAS TRAVELING AT 55+ MILES PER HOUR'AND I HAD TO TRY RESTARTING MY VEHICLE SEVERAL TIMES, WHILE TRAVELING IN NEUTRAL IN THE MIDDLE OF 4 LANES OF INTERSTATE TRAFFIC.    I PLAN TO BRING OUR VEHICLE BACK TO ANOTHER MECHANIC, SO THEY CAN TRY TO PROPERLY ADDRESS THIS SAFETY ISSUE'HOPEFULLY BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT ACCIDENTALLY WITH THE VEHICLE INTERMITTENTLY STALLING IN HEAVY TRAFFIC OR IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION.

I HAVE READ SEVERAL ARTICLES ONLINE ABOUT THIS INTERMITTENT STALLING PROBLEM WITH ESCAPES AND REALIZE THAT THE STALLING PROBLEM IS QUITE PREVALENT.

THERE ARE ALSO OCCASIONAL HEAVY METALLIC THUMPS OR KNOCKS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OR UNDERSIDE OF THE CAR, AND THE RIDE IS ROUGH.   THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR INNER METAL WHEELHOUSE IS EXTREMELY RUSTY. A FEW HOLES ARE SEVERAL INCHES SQUARE & GO ALL THE WAY THROUGH INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE CAR. PART OF THE RUST IS VERY NEAR WHERE THE TOP OF THE SHOCK ABSORBER BOLTS INTO THE WHEELHOUSE. THE WHEELHOUSE METAL IS SO RUSTY THAT I CAN FLEX IT WITH MY HAND AND CAUSE THE CREAKING SOUNDS.    I BELIEVE THE HEAVY METALLIC THUMPS ARE CAUSED WHEN THE CONICAL BUMPER INSIDE THE TOP OF THE SPRING BOTTOMS OUT AND HITS THE SUSPENSION MOUNTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SPRING. THIS LIKELY HAPPENS BECAUSE THE SHOCK ABSORBER CANNOT STOP IT, SINCE THE RUSTY WHEELHOUSE BENDS SO MUCH.   THIS SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM IS HEAVILY DOCUMENTED ON THE INTERNET BY A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. THE TOP OF THE SHOCK ABSORBER COULD CRASH THROUGH THE WHEELHOUSE AND PROTRUDE INTO THE CAR INTERIOR, INJURING OCCUPANTS OF THE CAR. THIS WOULD MAKE LOSS OF CONTROL MORE LIKELY. IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IF THE SHOCK ABSORBER BREAKS FREE AND BECOMES TANGLED UP WITH THE REAR WHEEL OR PUNCTURES THE TIRE.   THIS CAR IS A UNIBODY CONSTRUCTION, SO THIS WHEELHOUSE IS SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE STRUCTURAL STRENGTH FOR THAT PART OF THE CAR. IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH THIS RUSTY WHEELHOUSE WILL DISINTEGRATE AND NOT PROPERLY ABSORB THE CRASH ENERGY LIKE IT IS SUPPOSED TO. THIS MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE OCCUPANTS WILL GET INJURED.    PLEASE FORCE A VEHICLE RECALL ASAP WHICH MAKES FORD MOTOR CO. REPLACE THIS DANGEROUS WHEELHOUSE WITH ONE THAT HAS A SAFER, NON-RUSTING DESIGN.",

BATTERY LIGHT HAS SINCE GONE AWAY, BUT OTHER LIGHTS COME ON RANDOMLY.  BASED ON THE TYPE OF WORK I DO, IM CONVINCED THERE IS A SHORT OR BAD GROUND SOMEWHERE BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE TO BEGIN.  FORD WANTS $160/ HR TO DIAGNOSE THIS.  MY VEHICLE IS NOT ABUSED AND HAS ABOUT 110K MILES.  SINCE THE WHOLE CAR IS BASED ON THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, I FEEL THIS IS SOMETHING FORD SHOULD LOOK AT, DIAGNOSE AND FIX.  *TR",

WITH ONLY ONE REAR SHOCK ATTACHED TO THE VEHICLE AN UNCONTROLLABLE REAR SWAY COULD OCCUR RESULTING IN A POSSIBLE ROLL OVER. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF REPORTED COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME NATURE, WHICH GIVEN KNOWN STATISTICS IS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF ACTUAL CASES, I DO REQUEST A RECALL TO BE MADE.      *TR",

I AM TOLD THE VEHICLE IS UNDRIVEABLE IN THIS CONDITION. AND THAT IN MOST CASES CAN NOT BE REPAIRED. AFTER DOING MUCH RESEARCH ONLINE I FOUND HUNDREDS OF OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM. I HAVE ALSO CONTACTED FORD AND AM AWAITING A RESPONSE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A RECALL MADE ON THIS AS I CAN SEE THIS BEING A MAJOR PROBLEM THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT.

HE SAID WHEN FORD WAS PUTTING THE COATING ON THE INSIDE OF THE WHEEL WELL, THEY MUST NOT HAVE COATED IT ENOUGH AND MOISTURE GOT INSIDE CAUSING IT TO RUST. HE WENT BACK INSIDE AND ONE OF THE GUYS FROM THE SHOP HAPPENED TO BE INSIDE, SO HE CAME AND LOOKED AT IT AND SAID HE HAS NEVER SEEN THAT HAPPEN BEFORE EITHER AND HE HAS BEEN DOING BODY WORK FOR 25 YEARS!

WHEN I LOOKED IN MY REARVIEW MIRROR I SAW THE DEFROSTER WIRES HANGING WITH PIECES OF GLASS ATTACHED AND THE REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER MOTOR ASSEMBLY HANGING BY A THREAD, I REALIZED THE LOUD NOISE WAS MY REAR WINDSHIELD EXPLODING.  I HEADED BACK HOME TO ARRANGE TO HAVE THE GLASS REPLACED - FINAL COST $369.15.      THE REAR WIPER MOTOR WAS DAMAGED DURING THE EXPLOSION.

THEY FOUND A CHUNK OF ICE WEDGED INTO THE SEPARATOR KEEPING IT OPEN. THEY SAID THIS IS UNUSUAL.  ON 3-18-05 I BROUGHT MY CAR IN DUE TO THE RECALL & WAS GIVEN A NEW ACCELERATOR CABLE. WHAT HAPPENED TODAY WAS WHAT THE RECALL DESCRIBED WOULD HAPPEN WITH THE OLD CABLE.  SCARY. THE 1ST SERVICE TEAM SHOULD NOT HAVE LET ME GO.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. AFTER THEY FIX IT TOMORROW I WILL STILL BE NERVOUS TO DRIVE. THE FIRST SERVICE TEAM LET ME GO AND SAID THE CAR WAS FINE.  *JB",

ON THE WAY HOME FROM THE DEALERSHIP, THE VEHICLE PULLED STRONGLY TO THE LEFT, AND AN APPOINTMENT WAS MADE TO HAVE THE VEHICLE SERVICED.  ON 12/17/03, THE LEFT REAR POWER WINDOW HAD AN ELECTRICAL SHORT AND WOULD NOT CLOSE.  IT WENT INTO SERVICE AND THE ELECTRICAL SHORT WAS REPAIRED.  ON 12/19/03 WE BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN TO SERVICE FOR THE PULLING TO THE LEFT.  THEY TRIED AN ALIGNMENT ON THE VEHICLE, AND IT STILL PULLED TO THE LEFT.  THE SERVICE PEOPLE TOLD MY WIFE TO DRIVE IT FOR 400-600 MILES TO SEE IF IT CORRECTS ITSELF.  ON 12/22/03 I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE FORD SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE THEM CORRECT THE PROBLEM; AS I DID NOT FEEL THAT CONTINUING TO DRIVE IT WAS A PROPER SOLUTION.  THE SERVICE TRIED THE ALIGNMENT AGAIN, TRIED TO ROTATE THE TIRES, CHANGING THE TIRES, BUT NOTHING CORRECTED THE VEHICLE FROM PULLING TO THE LEFT. THEY CONTACTED FORD WHO ADVISED THAT THE TROUBLE MAY BE THE STEERING RACK.  ON 12/26/2003 I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE SERVICE DEPT, AND THEY PUT ON A NEW STEERING RACK, BUT THE VEHICLE STILL PULLED TO THE LEFT.  THE INFORMED THAT THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHY THE NEW 2004 WITH NOW 600 MILES ON IT STILL PULLS TO THE LEFT.  THE INFORMED THAT THEY WILL HAVE A FORD ENGINEER COME OUT TO SEE THE VEHICLE TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT THE ISSUE IS.  I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE FORD SALESMAN THAT SOLD ME THE VEHICLE AND THE SALES MANAGER ON MY CONCERNS ON BUYING A NEW VEHICLE WITH THESE ISSUES RIGHT FROM THE START.  THEY INFORMED THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO UNTIL THE FORD ENGINEER COMES TO CHECK THE VEHICLE OUT.   OUR CONCERN NOW IS THAT THE VEHICLE PULLS TO THE LEFT FOR UNKNOWN REASON THAT THE FORD SERVICE EXPERTS CANNOT FIGURE OUT, THESE PROBLEMS ARE OCCURING WHEN THE VEHICLE HAD ONLY 42 MILES ON IT.",
