FIRST WAS THE TRANSMISSION FAILURE MINE AND MY DAD'S ,BOTH FAILED AT SIMILAR TIMES AT IDENTICAL  TRUCKS. -AFTER FORD GAVE US THE RUN AROUND WE TOOK  THE TRUCKS TO A  REPAIR SHOP AND HAD TRANSMISSIONS FIXED.....NOTE THAT THE FAILURE OF THE COAST CLUTCH IN TRANSMISSIONS PREVENTED   THE TRUCKS FROM ENGINE BREAKING. THIS WAS PARTICULARLY SERIOUS WHEN TOWING, WHICH WAS  WHAT THIS TRUCK WAS MADE FOR.  MY DAD FOUND OUT THE  TRANSMISSION FAILED ON HIS WAY DOWN A MOUNTAIN PASS IN COLORADO PULLING A  11,000 POUND FIFTH WHEEL. THE NEXT COMPLAINT WAS REGARDING THE CAM POSITION SENSOR, WHICH FAILED  FASTER THAN  CAN REPLACED. THE NEXT COMPLAINT  WAS ABOUT THE  BRAKE SYSTEM. I HAVE DEALT  WITH DEALERSHIPS TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO TRY TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM, AND THEY COULDN'T DO IT, SO I FIXED IT MYSELF!  THE PROBLEM WAS A SEVERE PULL TO THE LEFT WHEN APPLYING BRAKES, THAT PROGRESSED TO A SEVERE PULL AND SHIMMY. .AGAIN, FORD COULDN'T FIX IT, I DID.  ALL OF THESE  WERE TREND ITEMS. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND RESEARCHING WWW.DIESELSTOP.COM AND BRIANS TRUCK SHOP.  EITHER ONE OF THESE SOURCES CAN ACCURATELY REFLECT THE FAILURES IN THESE PARTS ON THESE TRUCKS----THE REASON FORD DIDN'T GET MANY COMPLAINTS-----THEY CANT/WONT FIX IT UNTIL SOMEONE DIED.  *AK!",

THIS CIRCUIT BREAKER POWERS THE WALL THE PHONE BASE STATION WAS PLUGGED INTO, AND THAT WALL IS SHARED WITH THE GARAGE.  AFTER SOME MORE SEARCHING, I COULD NOT LOCATE THE SHORT THAT CAUSED THE TRIP AND I RESET THE BREAKER.  IT TRIPPED AGAIN.

THE PLUG FOR THE ENGINE BLOCK HEATER HAD SHORTED OUT, MELTED & CAUGHT FIRE....THIS CAUGHT MY TRUCK ON FIRE.  THE BACK SIDE OF THE PLUG HAD MELTED AND THE WIRE HAD BURNED AND BECOME DISCONNECTED.

WHILE TRAVELING BETWEEN MY HOME AND COLUMBUS, OHIO ON JULY 3, 2006, THE TREAD ON THE LEFT FRONT TIRE OF MY TRUCK SEPARATED FROM THE CASING. FORTUNATELY, I HAD PERCEIVED A PROBLEM DUE TO INCREASED VIBRATION AND HAD LOWERED MY SPEED AND WAS TRAVELING IN THE RIGHT HAND LANE. WHEN THE TIRE FAILED, I WAS ABLE TO PULL SAFELY OFF THE HIGHWAY WITH NO DAMAGE TO MY TRUCK OR FAMILY. I AM, HOWEVER, QUITE CONCERNED ABOUT THE REST OF THE TIRES ON MY TRUCK.  HONESTLY, WHEN THE WHOLE EXPLORER MESS WAS GOING ON, I INSISTED THAT THE ISSUE WAS DUE TO IMPROPERLY MAINTAINED TIRES, AND OWNER NEGLECT. I LOOKED AT IT AS A LITIGIOUS SOCIETY LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO BLAME AND SUE. WELL, MY THOUGHTS HAVE CHANGED CONSIDERABLY.   I AM A CAR GUY. I AM DILIGENT WITH THE CARE OF MY VEHICLES, AND THEIR MAINTENANCE. I ROUTINELY CHECK MY TIRE PRESSURES (MY AIR COMPRESSOR AND DIGITAL PRESSURE GAUGE ARE SITUATED RIGHT NEXT TO MY GARAGE DOOR SO I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO LOOK FOR THEM). I HAVE OWNED AUTOMOBILES FROM MOST EVERY MANUFACTURER, INCLUDING SIX FORD TRUCKS SEVERAL OF THOSE ON FIRESTONE TIRES. I HAVE NEVER HAD A TIRE FAILURE WHILE OUT ON THE ROAD, AND THE MODE OF FAILURE OF THIS TIRE IS ESPECIALLY FRIGHTENING.  LIKE I SAID, THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT NOTHING MORE THAN THE TIRE WAS DAMAGED, THE BETTER NEWS FOR FIRESTONE IS THAT I HAVE A TIRE THAT YOU CAN SURELY DO A FAILURE ANALYSIS ON, BECAUSE IT STILL HAS AIR IN IT, AND THE TREAD IS STILL PARTIALLY ATTACHED. THE BAD NEWS IS THAT NO ONE (FORD/FIRESTONE RETAILER) IS INTERESTED IN ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY. I CAN ASSURE YOU, THIS IS A TIRE ISSUE.  PLEASE ADVISE ME ON HOW TO PROCEED, AS I AM CERTAIN THAT FIRESTONE/BRIDGESTONE IS INTERESTED IN MAKING THIS RIGHT. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU.   *JB",

I WAS ABLE TO RETURN HOME AS I WAS ONLY ABOUT 1-1 1/5 MILES FROM MY HOUSE.  WHILE PEERING UNDER THE TRUCK, I NOTICED A LARGE GAPING HOLE IN THE GEAR BOX ON THE FRONT AXLE.  IT APPEARED THAT THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED INSIDE THE GEAR BOX HOUSING, BLOWING A LARGE HOLE IN THE METAL CASING.  I CONTACTED RICART FORD WHERE I PURCHASED THE TRUCK AND THEY ARRANGED TO HAVE THE TRUCK TOWED.     WHEN I INQUIRED ABOUT THIS BEING A FORD PROBLEM, I WAS TOLD THAT THE VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENTIRE COST OF THE REPAIR.  THE FINAL COST FOR THE REPAIRS WAS $3478.21 AND THE COST FOR A CAR RENTAL FOR THIS PERIOD OF TIME WAS $426.99.   GUIDELINES PER JEFF PENROD, FORD REP:                1.  IS THERE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FROM FORD?  CURRENT OR EXPIRED?  EVEN                       IF IT WAS EXPIRED, FORD MIGHT HELP PAY FOR THE REPAIRS.                2.  DOES THE CAR OWNER GO TO A FORD DEALER FOR MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS?                3.  IS THE OWNER RELATED TO A POLITICAL MEMBER OR FAMILY OF POWER/INFLUENCE?                   IF SO, FORD WOULD PROBABLY HELP.  SINCE I DID NOT FIT ANY OF THE ABOVE CATEGORIES, I WAS TOLD THAT FORD WOULD NOT HELP WITH THE REPAIRS.  WHEN I ASKED JEFF IF THERE WAS SOMEONE ABOVE HIM I COULD CONTACT, HE INFORMED ME THAT ALL THE DECISIONS COME DOWN TO HIM THAT'S WHY THEY PAY HIM.  EVEN IF IT GOES TO THE PRESIDENT, IT WILL COME BACK TO HIM.  I ASKED FOR JEFF'S PHONE NUMBER AND I WAS TOLD THAT HE DOES NOT HAVE A PHONE AND THAT I COULD CONTACT HIM THROUGH THE DEALER.   WHEN I ASKED THE TECHNICIANS HOW THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED, THEY HAD NO IDEA.  MY BELIEF IS THAT THERE WAS A LATENT DEFECT.  HOW ELSE COULD THIS HAVE HAPPENED?

WHEN I PICKED THE TRUCK UP THE AFTERNOON OF THE 10TH AND GOT IT HOME I LOOKED IN THE VALLEY OF THE ENGINE AND FOUND IT WAS STILL FULL OF OIL. I THEN PROCEED TO CLEAN UP THE EXCESS OIL AND SEE IF IT WAS LEAKING ANYMORE.  I'M NOT SURE HOW THE DEALER WAS ABLE TO TELL IT WASN'T LEAKING ANYMORE WHEN THEY LEFT ALL OF THAT OIL SITTING THERE, BUT I TOOK THERE WORD.  ON JANUARY 11,2003 I DROVE THE TRUCK 35 MILES AND CHECKED THE TOP OF THE ENGINE AGAIN, AND LOW AND BEHOLD THERE WAS OIL POOLING IN THE VALLEY AGAIN. SINCE JANUARY 11,2003 WAS A SATURDAY I WAS ONLY ABLE TO CONTACT VOICEMAIL AT THE DEALERSHIP. I AM NOW AWAITING A PHONE CALL MONDAY MORNING FROM THE DEALERSHIP AS WELL AS RESEARCHING THE MAGNUSON-MOSS WARRANTY ACT FOR MY OWN PROTECTION.  FORD IS WELL AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND STILL CHOOSES TO DO NOTHING ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  I AM ALSO WELL AWARE OF MANY OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM AND WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO FILL THIS COMPLAINT FORM OUT.*AK",
