USING BOTH BUTTON AND KEY AT THE SAME TIME, I WAS ABLE TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND OPEN IT.  DISSASSEMBLY OF THE DOOR AND LATCH LOCATED THE PROBLEM TO BE THE DOOR LATCH MECHANISM.  THE DOOR LATCH IS DESIGNED TO FAIL AS EVIDENCED BY THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS LISTING THIS PART. THE LEVER THAT IS MOVED INTO PLACE WHEN THE DOOR IS UNLOCKED IS BLOCKED BY THE CAM THAT IT INTERFACES WITH BECAUSE THE CAM HAS ROTATED BEYOND THE POINT THAT IT SHOULD.  THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TRAP SOMEONE IN THE CAR IF IT SHOULD FAIL AT THE WRONG TIME.  *TR",

THE CAR WOULD SHUT OFF IF LEFT TO IDLE.  THE CAR JERKED WHEN TAKING OFF AND IT SOUNDED LIKE THE ENGINE WAS BOUNCING AROUND UNDER THE HOOD.  SO I HAD IT TAKEN BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE IT FIXED.
