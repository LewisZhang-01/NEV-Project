Lexus sent a letter informing me of the recall, but it was sent to my parents house and I did not receive it in time. After finding the recall letter, the pandemic also prevented me from making it to the dealership in time. The letter they sent me also had no markings to indicate it was a recall or that the information inside was important in any way so the letter was easily ignored. I spoke with a lexus dealership and lexus corporate and they both refused to perform the safety repair because I was about 2 to 3 months past their deadline (June 2020?). As a result, my front passenger air bag is inoperable and any front riding passenger in my vehicle is at a greatly increased safety risk in the event of a serious crash. Lexus admitted the problem with their wiring harness and instituted a recall, so I don't think it is fair for them to potentially sacrifice the lives and the safety of my front riding passengers because of a superficial deadline. I would appreciate any help you could provide in convincing lexus to honor their safety recall for my vehicle. Thank you.",

WHEN I SHIFTED THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FROM REVERSE TO DRIVE IT SUDDEN ACCELERATED FOR A BRIEF MOMENT, BUT IT WAS CLEAR IN FRONT OF ME AND I REMAIN IN CONTROL. IT ONLY HAPPENED TO ME THAT ONE TIME THAT WEEK AND I THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT. IN THE MORNING OF MAY 29, 2019 THE CAR WAS PARALLEL PARKED WITH A VEHICLE BOTH IN FRONT BEHIND IT. MY WIFE SLOWLY BACK UP THE CAR TO ALLOW ROOM TO PULL OUT OF THE PARKING SPOT. SHE TURN THE FRONT WHEELS TOWARDS THE CURB SO THAT THE FRONT OF THE CAR WOULD SLIGHTLY STICK OUT. WHEN SHE SHIFTED THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FROM REVERSE TO DRIVE, THE CAR SUDDENLY ACCELERATED, JUMP OVER THE CURB AND HIT THE CONCRETE WALL OF A SCHOOL. SHE PANICKED AT THE SUDDEN ACCELERATION AND DOES NOT REMEMBER IF SHE STEP ON ANY PEDAL DURING THAT TIME. SHE ONLY KNOWS IT ACCELERATED AS SOON AS SHE SHIFTED TO DRIVE AND THEN THE CAR HIT THE WALL. THERE WERE NO INJURIES AND NO OTHER CAR WAS INVOLVED.

THE CAR MAKER SHOULD STEP-UP AND CREATE A WAITING LIST WEBSITE THAT SCHEDULES APPOINTMENTS AT ANY LOCAL DEALER THAT IS READY TO REPAIR.

I DIDN'T CAUSE THIS RECALL THE LETTER WAS SENT TO ME.  SHE TOLD ME IT WAS NOTHING DANGEROUS (THE NUT ON THE WIPER) IT WAS ONLY IF YOU WERE DEALING WITH SNOW. THIS MAY BE TRUE I DON'T KNOW BUT I WOULD HATE TO BE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND IT FALL OFF BECAUSE SHE SAYS IT IS NOTHING.
