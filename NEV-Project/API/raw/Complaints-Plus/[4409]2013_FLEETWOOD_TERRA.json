AFTER FIXING THE SHEARED OFF SCREWS ALL 3 OF THEM ON THE ANGLE PIECE BY THE FIRE WALL MY DASH IS STILL MOVING.  FLEETWOOD PUT 3 SCREWS INON BOTH SIDES. I REALLY THINK THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL SINCE THE DASH FELL 2 INCHES WHEN THEY SHEARED OFF. NOW NO ONE WILL TOUCH THE SEPARATION OF THE FLOOR FROM THE WALL THEY SAY GO TO A BODY SHOP.  SOMEONE IS GOING TO DIE FLEETWOOD WITH YOUR POOR WORKMANSHIP BUT I'M SURE YOU DON'T MIND JUST THE MONEY.PLEASE HELP HOW I CAN GET THIS FIXED",
