THIS WAS AN OFFER FROM GM TO REPAIR THIS KNOWN DEFECT IF IT OCCURED EITHER BEFORE 120K MILES OR 10 YEARS. MY WIFE'S 2008 SATURN OUTLOOK IS USED FOR KID TRANSPORTATION AND LOCAL TRIPS MOSTLY SO SHE NEVER PUTS ON THAT MUCH MILEAGE.   THIS VEHICLE WENT INTO SERVICE IN OR AROUND 10/2008.   ON OR AROUND MARCH 1, 2019 HER OUTLOOK BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE ISSUES CONSISTENT WITH THIS GM TSB, FAILURE OF THE 35R WAVE PLATE, A KNOW ISSUE DOCUMENTED BY GM.THE THING WOULD JERK AND SHAKE IN REVERSE, WOULD EITHER FAIL TO SHIFT INTO 3RD OR 5TH OR IF IT DID, WHINE AND SHOW NO ACCELERATION IN THE LEAST. IT HAPPENED ABOUT 10 TIMES, ON LOCAL ROADS AND ON THE HIGHWAY, VERY DANGEROUS. I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN TO OUR LOCAL CHEVY DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS SHOT, ONLY 67K MILES AND IT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. I ASKED THE SERVICE WRITER ABOUT HAVING THE TRANSMISSION REPAIRED RATHER THAN REPLACED. HE REALLY RECOMMENDED A FACTORY REBUILT UNIT.  WE WERE LITERALLY 120 DAYS, 4 MONTHS OUTSIDE OF THE WARRANTY COVERAGE PERIOD ON THIS ISSUE. SATURN/GM WOULD NOT BUDGE AND TOLD ME THAT AT SOME POINT I HAD TO OWN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE REPAIR! REALLY? ON A KNOW ISSUE THAT WAS OUTLINED IN THE TSB AS, \"UPON FAILURE ONLY\" SHOULD I BRING MY VEHICLE IN FOR REPAIR. HOW IS THIS FAIR?  I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I EXPECT FROM THE NHTSA, BUT TO SIMPLY KNOW THAT GM SHOULD HAVE HONORED THE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT, IT WAS ONLY FOUR MONTHS PAST THE CUT OFF AND IT IS A KNOW ISSUE.

I HAVE TWO CHILDREN WHO I DRIVE AROUND ALL DAY LONG AND I HAVE BEEN VERY LUCKY WE HAVEN'T BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT DUE TO THIS YET. ONCE IT WAS ON A VERY BUSY HIGH SPEED ROAD. WHILE I DO NOT KNOW WHY THIS KEEPS HAPPENING, THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT CLEARLY NEEDS GM'S ATTENTION, AND IT SHOULD BE FIXED BY GM. THE FIRST TIME I WAS PARKED AND AS SOON AS I PUT MY CAR INTO REVERSE IT POPPED, THE SECOND I WAS DRIVING AT ALMOST 60MPH, THE THIRD I WAS ON A BACK ROAD GOING AROUND 30MPH.",

A SHORT TIME AGO I WATCHED A VIDEO ON YOUTUBE OF A GENTLEMAN DESCRIBING AND SHOWING WHAT LEAKING WATER DID TO HIS HEATER OR DEFROST MOTOR.

THIS CAR HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE.    MY LIST OF PROBLEMS/REPAIRS:  - IT OVERHEATED TWICE.  THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED, I REPLACED THE RADIATOR CAP.  THE SECOND TIME IT HAPPENED, I REPLACED THE THERMOSTAT, WHICH IN TURN CAUSED THE WATER PUMP TO LEAK.   - I REPLACED AN ENGINE SOLENOID VALVE.  WHILE INSPECTING MY CAR, THE MECHANIC ALSO NOTICED I HAD A TRANSAXLE LEAK.    - THE THROTTLE BODY SHORTED.    - THE BRAKE MASTER CYLINDER LEAKED.  - I REPLACED THE CV JOINTS.  ACTUALLY, THE MECHANIC TOLD ME MY FRONT END NEEDED REPAIRING - CV JOINTS, STRUTS AND STEERING BUSHING. I COULD ONLY AFFORD TO REPAIR THE CV JOINTS AND AM CURRENTLY GETTING QUOTES FOR REPAIRS ON THE STRUTS.  - I HAD AN OIL LEAK (FROM THE OIL PAN).    A CAR THAT IS ONLY 7 YEARS OLD HAS HAD TO HAVE THESE KINDS OF REPAIRS - AND SOME WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS OF OWNERSHIP.  THIS IS ABSOLUTELY HORRID!  THE NHTSA SHOULD GOOGLE THE REVIEWS ON THIS CAR.  OWNERS COMPLAIN OF THE SAME PROBLEMS REGARDLESS OF MODEL/YEAR (XE/XR, 2007-2010) - LEAKING ROOFS (LUGGAGE RACK), BRAKE MASTER CYLINDER LEAKS, POWER STEERING ISSUES, THERMOSTAT/WATER PUMP LEAKS, TRANSMISSION ISSUES, ETC.      GM'S RESPONSE TO THIS HAS BEEN ABYSMAL.  THIS CAR IS A LEMON.  INSTEAD OF RECALLING IT, GM WOULD RATHER SPARSELY SEND RECALLS FOR SPECIFIC FAILURES A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT - AFTER FOLKS HAVE SPENT THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY ON REPAIRS.    THE NHTSA SHOULD LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS. GM CLEARLY COVERED UP HORRIFIC SUPPLY CHAIN, MANUFACTURING AND ASSEMBLY ISSUES AND INTENTIONALLY INSTALLED DEFECTIVE PARTS IN THESE CARS.    *TR",

SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT HALEY INFORMED ME THAT THE RECALL WAS PERFORMED PER GM SPECIFICATIONS HOWEVER, THE WARNING LIGHT WAS STILL ON DUE TO A FAULTY PASSENGER PRESENCE MODULE (DIAGNOSTIC CODE:  B0081).  AT THE TIME OF THIS REPAIR I HAD AN EXTENDED WARRANTY UNDER THE GMPP (GENERAL MOTORS PROTECTION PLAN) WHICH WAS STILL VALID UNTIL AUGUST OF 2014 OR 107,000 MILES WHICH EVER CAME FIRST.  I WAS TOLD BY GMPP THAT THIS MODULE WAS NOT COVERED UNDER MY CURRENT WARRANTY.  SINCE THIS VISIT I HAVE TAKEN MY COMPLAINT THROUGH NOT ONLY THE DEALERSHIP BUT THROUGH CORPORATE GM ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS PLEADING WITH THEM THAT THIS WAS A SAFETY RELATED ISSUE NOT A WARRANTY ISSUE.  GM HAS STATED TO ME THAT THIS IS NOT A SAFETY RELATED ISSUE AND THAT THIS PART IS NO LONGER COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  THEY WANT ME TO PAY THEM $900 FOR THIS REPAIR AND I REFUSE TO PAY THEM BECAUSE THIS REPAIR SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER GENERAL MOTORS.

SOMETIMES IF YOU MOVE AROUND IN THE SEAT OR GET OUT AND THEN GET BACK IN IT WILL COME ON BUT THERE ARE NOT GUARANTEES. I TOOK IT TO MY DEALER AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT IT IS A SENSOR IN THE SEAT AND THAT I WILL HAVE TO PAY $900 TO REPLACE THE SENSOR SO THAT MY PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG WILL ACTUALLY FUNCTION. AFTER SEARCHING THE WEB I HAVE FOUND THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM AND THAT IT NEEDS TO BE A 'SAFETY RECALL\". IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IT IS A WIDE SPREAD PROBLEM WITH A RIDICULOUS PRICE TAG FOR FIXING. AN UNAFFORDABLE PRICE FOR ANY AVERAGE PERSON! IF THE COMPANY CARES ABOUT SAFETY THEY WILL PUT OUT A RECALL AND FIX THIS PROBLEM. IN ADDITION I NOTICED ON SEVERAL SITES THAT EVEN AFTER THE SENSOR WAS REPLACED THAT THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED. IN MY OPINION THEY NEED TO COME UP WITH A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM FOR THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAGS. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FEEL SAFE IN OUR OWN VEHICLES.\"  I HAVEN'T RESOLVED MY PROBLEM.  THE DEALER FIRST SAID THEY WOULD PAY 30% OF THE $900 IF I COVERED THE REST.  THEY HAVE NOW DECIDED THAT THEY WILL COVER 70% IF I COVER THE REMAINING $270.  NOW THIS SEEM LIKE A GREAT DEAL CONSIDERING THE COST IS $900 HOWEVER IT IS STILL A SAFETY ISSUE AND I DON'T THINK I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING.  I CONTINUE TO FIND MORE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM.  IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND A RECALL NEEDS TO BE ORDERED.  I WILL CONTINUE TO FILE COMPLAINTS TO EVERY ORGANIZATION THAT I FIND UNTIL THIS ISSUE IS ADDRESSED AND IT IS REPLACED FOR FREE.  I DIDN'T DAMAGE THE SENSOR IT IS BAD ON MANY SATURN'S.

WE WERE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE AND THE VEHICLE SEEMED TO SWITCH GEARS OK IN EVERY OTHER GEAR...BUT REALLY STRUGGLED WHEN IN THE LOWER GEARS.  WE BROUGHT IT INTO TO SEE IF POSSIBLY IT JUST NEEDED TO HAVE THE TRANSMISSION FLUSHED AND WERE ADVISED AGAINST DOING THAT.  INSTEAD, THEY TOPPED OF THE TRANSMISSION FLUID AND OUR VEHICLE SEEMED TO RUN SMOOTHLY FOR EXACTLY ONE WEEK.  AND THAN BOOM, WE HAD THE EXACT SAME SYMPTOM WHERE THE VEHICLE COULD NOT SHIFT OUT OF LOWER GEARS AND THIS TIME IT HAD A BURNING TYPE SMELL.  I WENT ONLINE AND, TO MY SURPRISE, FOUND PAGE AND PAGE OF DISCUSSIONS SURROUNDING TRANSMISSION ISSUES WITH THE 2007 AND 2008 SATURN OUTLOOK.  IN ALL CASES, THE SYMPTOMS WERE IDENTICAL.  IN ALL CASES, COMPLETE TRANSMISSION REBUILDS WERE THE ONLY SOLUTION.  MOST VEHICLES WERE JUST OUTSIDE OF THEIR WARRANTY, BUT IN SOME CASES, THE MILEAGE WAS AS LOW AS 30,000.  GM IS FULLY AWARE OF THE SITUATION, YET IS DOING NOTHING TO RECTIFY THE MATTER.  THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A FAULTY \"WAVE PLATE\" IN THESE CARS THAT IS CAUSING THE TRANSMISSIONS TO COMPLETELY BREAK DOWN.  IF YOU GOOGLE \"2008 SATURN TRANSMISSIONS\" YOU WILL FIND ALL OF THE EVIDENCE YOU WANT TO SUPPORT THE NEED TO INVESTIGATE A POSSIBLE RECALL.

I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW A MANUFACTURER COULD TOTALLY IGNORE A SAFETY ISSUE THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR INJURY OR DEATH IF THERE IS A FAILURE OF THE AIR BAG TO DEPLOY OR EVEN DEPLOY ACCIDENTALLY.   *TR",

FIVE MINUTES PRIOR TO THAT, I WOULD HAVE BEEN ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY WITH SCHOOL AGED KIDS ON BOARD - I SHUTTER TO THINK OF THE POSSIBILITIES. NO WARNINGS PRIOR TO THIS EVER. (1/28/13) I CONTACTED GMC DIRECTLY, RECEIVED A CLAIM NUMBER FROM THEM, FOLLOWED THAT UP WITH A PHONE CALL TO A TOWING COMPANY & THEN THE GMC DEALERSHIP TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THE VEHICLE WAS ON IT'S WAY. RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE DEALERSHIP - DIAGNOSIS NEWS - WE NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION (WE WEREN'T SURPRISED). THE ESTIMATE WASN'T FULLY COMPLETED YET (NEVER A GOOD SIGN) & THEY WOULD CALL LATER WITH THE COST. I MISSED THAT LATER IN THE EVENING - I'D HAD ENOUGH & TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE WAS MAKING ME MADDER BY THE MINUTE. HOW CAN YOU CLAIM TO DO SUCH 'RIGOROUS TESTING' ON YOUR VEHICLES & THEN HAVE TRANSMISSION FAILURE HAPPEN IN A MATTER OF MINUTES WITHOUT ANY WARNING WHATSOEVER!! (1/29/13) I WAS INFORMED OF THE COST (I NEARLY HIT THE FLOOR) BUT WAIT - THEY WERE OFFERING A 10% DISCOUNT & I COULD GET A $200 VISA REBATE FROM GM - LIKE I'D WON A PRIZE OR SOMETHING. IS THIS SUPPOSED TO MAKE IT BETTER?! HOW ABOUT STANDING BEHIND YOUR PRODUCT?!  IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT GM HAS A PROBLEM WITH THEIR TRANSMISSIONS JUST BASED ON THE MANY POSTS ON EDMUNDS & ONLINE - PERHAPS A RECALL IS IN ORDER. I WAS THE ONE WHO  PURSUED MY FORD HUSBAND WITH \"LET'S GIVE A GMC CAR A TRY, IT'S AMERICAN MADE TOO. SO MUCH FOR THAT - SHAME ON ME. THIS IS SO WRONG TO HAVE TO REPLACE THIS TRANSMISSION AT THIS POINT & HAVING TO PAY FOR IT PAY FOR IT ENTIRELY ONLY ADDS INSULT TO INJURY! SHAME ON ME - NO - SHAME ON YOU GMC!! *TR",

I HATE TO KEEP REPLACING HEADLIGHTS IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE HARNESS, WHICH IS EVIDENT BY SEARCHING ON THE INTERNET FOR INFORMATION ABOUT REPLACING THE HEADLIGHTS IN THE SATURN OUTLOOKS.  IT TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF TIME AND EFFORT JUST TO GET TO THE BULB CHANGED ONLY TO HAVE IT CONTINUE TO BURN OUT AFTER A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.  I REALLY BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THESE HEADLIGHT HARNESSES AS THE COMPANY SHOULD FIX THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE CONTACTED SATURN AND WAS TOLD I WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO TAKE IT TO A GMC DEALER AND HAVE AN EVALUATION DONE ON THE VEHICLE.  I AM VERY UPSET WITH GM ABOUT THIS.  *TR",

IN APRIL 2010, THE LEFT LOW BEAM HEADLIGHT/DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHT WENT OUT.

I WAS TOLD THAT, SINCE THERE HAD BEEN NO RECALL, IT WOULD NOT BE A WARRANTY ITEM, AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS MYSELF.  SINCE THE SATURN DEALER IS ABOUT 50 MILES AWAY, AND IT WAS NOT GOING TO BE COVERED BY WARRANTY, I OPTED TO HAVE IT REPAIRED AT A SHOP MUCH CLOSER TO HOME.  AFTER DETERMINING THAT THE BULB WAS FUNCTIONAL, THEY ORDERED A NEW WIRING HARNESS, AND INSTALLED IT IN LESS THAN AN HOUR (TO THE TUNE OF $171.44). I ASKED TO SEE THE OLD HARNESS, AND UPON INSPECTION, I OBSERVED THAT THE HOUSING AROUND ONE OF THE CONNECTION POINTS WAS CLEARLY BURNT AND MELTED.

PLEASE UNDERSTAND, I HAVE TWO SMALL KIDS (2 1/2 YEAR OLD AND A 10 MONTH OLD) AND BOTH OF THE KIDS RIDE IN THE BACK SEAT IN THEIR CAR SEATS. AND EVEN WITH THE KIDS IN THEIR CAR SEATS AND MY WIFE SITTING IN BETWEEN THEM, THE SEATS POPS UP.    I HONESTLY DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE. I HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED TO GO TO THE NEWS MEDIA AND SHOW THEM THE DANGER OF THIS MALFUNCTION AND IT SEEMS THAT THIS IS THE LAST BEST SUGGESTION FOR SATURN TO CONSIDER HELPING ME. MY WARRANTY ENDS IN DECEMBER 2010 AND WHAT WILL I DO THEN? I HAVE MET OTHERS AT THE DEALERSHIP WITH THIS PROBLEM AND ONE OF THEM WAS A SATURN MECHANIC (RAUL, WHO OWNS AN OUTLOOK) WHO HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND HE CONFESSED TO ME THAT HE FIXED HIS BY HAVING ONE OF HIS EMPLOYEES ORDER THE PART (NEW 2ND ROW SEATS). I ASKED HIM WHY HE COULD NOT DO IT, AND HIS RESPONSE WAS, \"SORRY, BUT IT DID NOT HAPPEN IN THE MECHANIC'S PRESENCE.\"   I UNDERSTAND THAT POLICY, BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND MY CONCERNS FOR MY FAMILY AND THEIR SAFETY.   I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT SATURN IS OUT OF BUSINESS, BUT SOMEBODY NEEDS TO BE HELD RELIABLE FOR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO ME OR MY FAMILY.   I HOPE SATURN UNDERSTANDS THIS MAJOR CONCERN (DEFECT) AND I HOPE SATURN DOES NOT EXPERIENCE WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO TOYOTA IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS WITH THEIR DEATH DEFECT ON VEHICLES. *TR",

MY VEHICLE HAS HAD PROBLEMS WITH STEERING, TRANSMISSION, AND THE ELECTRIC SEAT, BUT THE MAIN REASON THAT THE VEHICLE WAS BROUGHT IN FOR REPAIR ON EACH OF THE SIX VISITS IS AS FOLLOWS:    WHEN RAINING, WATER APPEARS IN THE FOLLOWING LOCATIONS:  (A) PASSENGER SIDE, 2ND COLUMN; (B) PASSENGER SIDE, DIRECTLY BELOW GLOVE COMPARTMENT; (C) PASSENGER SIDE, FLOOR AREA; (D) PASSENGER SIDE DOOR, FLOOR AREA DIRECTLY BELOW DOOR; (E) PASSENGER SIDE WINDSHIELD, DROPPING FROM TOP OF WINDSHIELD AREA ONTO DASHBOARD; (F) PASSENGER SIDE SEATBELT -- COMPLETELY SOAKING WET; (G) PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG PLUG, WATER DRIPPING OUT FROM EDGES; (H) DRIVER SIDE SEATBELT; (I) DRIVER SIDE WINDOW.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN EACH AND EVERY TIME IT RAINS; IT HAPPENS EVERY 2 TO 4 TIMES IT RAINS. THE LAST TIME IT WAS BROUGHT IN TO SATURN, SMOKE WAS POURING OUT FROM BELOW THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT AND THERE WAS A VERY BAD \"ELECTRICAL\" TYPE OF SMELL.  THE HEADLINER HAS BEEN REMOVED A COUPLE OF TIMES; THEY HAVE VERIFIED THAT THERE IS DAMPNESS AND A WATER LEAK ABOVE THE HEADLINER, BUT THEY CANNOT REPLICATE OR DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAKING.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS INFORMED THAT AT THIS POINT THEY CAN DO NOTHING FURTHER TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  THEY STATE THAT AN ENGINEER FROM SATURN MUST LOOK AT THE VEHICLE TO ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE WRITTEN TO SATURN AND THEY ARE SENDING SOMEONE OUT TO LOOK AT IT NEXT WEEK.  IF IT CANNOT BE REPAIRED, I AM INSTITUTING LEMON LAW PROCEEDINGS.  THE CAR REEKS OF MILDEW. *TR",

HE IMMEDIATELY SAID TO MY WIFE, \" MOM, I THINK I HAVE A PROBLEM HERE.\"  SHE REACHED BACK AND PLACED HER HAND BETWEEN THE SEAT BELT AND THE FRONT OF HIS THROAT. THERE WAS ONLY ROOM FOR HER TO GET HER INDEX, MIDDLE AND RING FINGER IN. MY WIFE YELLED \" YOUR SON IS STUCK, WE CAN'T GO YET.\" I WALKED AROUND TO THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE OUTLOOK TO SEE MY WIFE HOLDING THE SEALTBELT FROM GETTING TIGHTER AROUND MY SON'S NECK.
