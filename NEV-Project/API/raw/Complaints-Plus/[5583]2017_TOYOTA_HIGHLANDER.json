Each time, the dealership attempted to resolve the problem finding issues with struts; however, it only went away in late March after having the vehicle in the shop for weeks at a time on 5 different occasions Nov 2018 - Mar 2019. I engaged Toyota HQ (800-331-4331) - filing report #1901092572 - requesting an exchange of the vehicle. This was denied and I was offered a 8 year warranty. *Due to COVID, I rarely drove this vehicle through 2020 and most of 2021, where to date, I have only ~34,000 miles on the vehicle. -On 21 Oct 2021, my wife was stopped at a gas station and attempted to start the vehicle. The vehicle would not start and the following lights came on without previous warning: 1)Braking Power Low, 2)Maintenance needed soon, & 3)Orange yellow triangle lit up with exclamation mark. My wife was stranded for 3 hours and the vehicle had to be towed. The dealership informed me that Toyota installed a generic battery into the vehicle (when being sold) that was only to have 4-5 years of life; however, my concern was that this vehicle had just completed maintenance and there was no warning of this upcoming issue. When repaired, I had to pay for the name brand (True Start) battery. -On 16 Jan 2022, after having driven the Highlander for 25 minutes, I started the engine while in a parking lot. While moving forward and the engine still going, the brakes and power steering went out. On the dashboard, the same lights that came on in Oct 2021, did so again.  I had to let the vehicle coast (having no control) with my wife and child in the car through the parking lot. It came to a stop at the concrete parking curb stop at a store front. Toyota stated that since there was no check engine light that there was no code and they could not duplicate the problem. The vehicle was sent back to me with no resolution or explanation.",

I sat there for over 30 mins trying to get the vehicle to start. It never started. It had to be towed to the Toyota dealership.  The Toyota diagnostic revealed that I needed a new battery.

Upon starting a whole bunch of lights flashed on the dash but the message that came up was low braking power, check AWD system.   At this point the car would not start without a jump.

Our car stopped working. In the middle of a rush hour in heat at the top of the mountain, we had to get from the far left lane to the far right to stop. While trying to get over, the car jerked, revved, and we almost got into accidents because I just couldn't get the car to go without delayed reactions and then jerked to a fast motion. VERY UNSAFE! At the same time, check engine light, ABD, and sensor lights flashed on. I got on the side to turn the car off and on again and tried to go a little at a snail pace speed and still the same thing happened. We had to get towed over 100 miles away to our home with young kids. When we got it looked at, the transmission company let me know we had to replace it and we had a unsalvageable transmission and we needed to purchase a new one. He also ,mentioned he was suspicious because he doesnt regularly get my type of car but coincidentally he has seen at least 3 with the same make model and even color in his shop in the last couple of months. The sensor lights were a completely separate problem that happened at the same exact time, very suspicious. Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? yes on both issues Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others? only transmission company and certified Toyota servicer Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? Both warning lights appeared after the first jerking and dangerous switching lanes event. once we got over, all lights came on",

I USED CRUISE CONTROL WITH 65 MPH ON HIGHWAY.  AFTER I FINISHED TRAVELING THERE, I TRIED TO USE THE SAME CRUISE CONTROL ON THE WAY HOME.  AND THEN SUDDENLY MY CAR MADE PROBLEM IN THE MIDDLE OF DRIVING ON HIGHWAY.  RPM WENT UP TO OVER 3000 AND RPM NEEDLE ON DASHBOARD STARTED DANCING.  AND I WATCHED 'CHECK AWD SYSTEM','TRACTION CONTROL TURNED OFF','CHECK ENGINE VISIT YOUR DEALERSHIP' COMING UP.  AUTOMATICALLY MY CAR LOST POWER CONTROL. WE WERE VERY SCARED BECAUSE EVERYONE THERE WAS DRIVING A CAR WITH HIGH SPEED AT NIGHT.  I TURNED ON EMERGENCY LIGHT AND PUT MY CAR ON SERVICE ROAD.  FORTUNATELY, NO BODY FOLLOWED BEHIND MY CAR AT THAT TIME.  IF SOMEONE KEPT APPROACHING MY CAR,WE WOULD HAVE MADE BIG TRAFFIC ACCIDENT.  THIS IS SAFETY ISSUE FOR US.  EVEN IF WE ARE STILL ALIVE, I DON'T HAVE ANY COURAGEOUS IDEA ABOUT MY CAR.  I WILL NOT BE SATISFIED WITH MY CAR.  WHENEVER I DRIVE IT, I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT MY CAR CONDITION.  FOR EXAMPLE, I FOUND THE SAME STORY ABOUT MY HIGHLANDER THROUGH CARCOMPLAINTS.COM   THAT CAR WAS EVENTUALLY BURNED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIGHWAY.  SO I WANT MY MONEY BACK BY LEMON LAW.",

THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME MY REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION WAS THE ONLY ONE IN THE COUNTRY (USA) WHEN THEY ORDERED IT!  IF THIS IS HAPPENING WITH SO MANY HIGHLANDERS WITH THIS 8-SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT RESULTS FROM THE TRANSMISSION FAILING ON SOMEONE ELSE.",

TOYOTA AGREES THIS REQUIRES INSTALLATION OF A BRAKE CONTROLLER IN THE HIGHLANDER AND ELECTRIC BRAKES ON THE RV TRAILER. I INSTALLED A BRAKE CONTROLLER FOLLOWING STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICES. WHEN THE MANUAL BRAKE SWITCH IS THEN APPLIED, MY TOYOTA HIGHLANDER DISPLAYS \"PRE-COLLISION SYSTEM MALFUNCTION\" WARNING MESSAGE EVEN IF THE PRE-COLLISION SYSTEM IS TURNED-OFF. (NOTE: THIS ISSUE ONLY OCCURS IN 2017 AND 2018 HIGHLANDERS SINCE EARLIER VERSIONS DID NOT COME EQUIPPED WITH A COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM).  I BELIEVE THAT THE BURDEN SHOULD BE ON  TOYOTA TO PROVIDE PROPER INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RECTIFY THIS ISSUE. TOYOTA HAS NOT PROPERLY ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE DESPITE MY REPEATED LETTERS TO TOYOTA.    I AM PARTICULARLY CONCERNED THAT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF GUIDANCE PROVIDED  BY TOYOTA ON THIS ISSUE, SOME FOLKS (AS NOTED ON INTERNET  HTTP://WWW.TOYOTANATION.COM/FORUM/333-HIGHLANDER-3RD-GENERATION-2014/1509914-7-PIN-WIRING-HARNESS-2017-HIGHLANDER-LIMITED.HTML) ARE INSERTING A DIODE TO PREVENT THEIR BRAKE CONTROLLER FROM DRIVING POWER BACK ONTO THE BRAKE SENSE LINE IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE \"PRE-COLLISION SYSTEM MALFUNCTION\" WARNING MESSAGE. THIS ALSO PREVENTS THE BRAKE LIGHTS ON BOTH THE TOW VEHICLE AND TRAILER FROM BEING LIT WHEN THE TRAILER BRAKES ARE MANUALLY APPLIED. I BELIEVE THIS TO BE UNSAFE. THE ABILITY TO APPLY THE TRAILER BRAKES INDEPENDENTLY OF THE TOW VEHICLE  BRAKES (I.E. THE MANUAL OVERRIDE CAPABILITY) IS A SAFETY FEATURE FOR REDUCING TRAILER SWAY WHICH CAN OCCUR IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. FURTHERMORE, IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MANUAL OVERRIDE CAPABILITY IS REQUIRED BY LAW IN CALIFORNIA. TOYOTA NEEDS TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE SINCE ONLY THEY HAVE THE DETAILED KNOWLEDGE NEEDED TO DEVELOP A SOLUTION.",

        "summary": "2017 TOYOTA HIGHLANDER SE AWD (\"VEHICLE\").     ON JANUARY 26, 2017 AT APPROXIMATELY 11:15 P.M., PACIFIC TIME, I WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE ON THE INTERSTATE 10 FREEWAY NEAR THE LA BREA AVENUE EXIT. IT WAS DARK BUT CLEAR WITH LIGHT TO MEDIUM TRAFFIC.     WHILE I WAS DRIVING AROUND 80 MPH AND MERGING TOWARD AN INNER LANE, THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY - ON ITS OWN - SLOWED TO AROUND 30 OR 40 MPH. CONCOMITANTLY, THE VEHICLE'S MESSAGING SYSTEM (BETWEEN THE TACHOMETER AND SPEEDOMETER) BEGAN BLINKING AND ALERTING ME THAT THE ALL WHEEL DRIVE SYSTEM WAS EXPERIENCING FAILURE AND THAT THE VEHICLE NEEDED IMMEDIATE SERVICING. A SMALL ORANGE TRIANGULAR INDICATOR WITH AN EMBEDDED EXCLAMATION POINT FLASHED AS WELL.     I ENGAGED THE HAZARD LIGHTS AND THEN MANIPULATED THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTER INTO VARIOUS POSITIONS WHILE FULLY DEPRESSING THE ACCELERATOR, BUT THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT ACCELERATE OVER 30 OR 40 MPH. FACED WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING REAR ENDED, I DISENGAGED THE HAZARD LIGHTS, SIGNALED TO THE RIGHT, AND EVENTUALLY MADE IT OFF THE FREEWAY.    THE FOLLOWING DAY, JANUARY 27, 2017, I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP WHERE I BELIEVE IT IS STILL BEING DIAGNOSED . THE LONGER THE DIAGNOSIS TAKES, THE MORE I AM CONCERNED THAT TOYOTA HAS NOT DETERMINED THE REMEDY FOR THIS ISSUE. GIVEN TOYOTA'S HISTORY, I AM ALSO CONCERNED THEY MAY RETURN THE VEHICLE TO ME WITHOUT DETERMINING CONCLUSIVELY HOW THE PROBLEM OCCURRED AND WITHOUT FIXING THE ISSUE SO THAT IT WILL NOT POSE A THREAT TO MY PASSENGERS, INCLUDING MY OWN FAMILY, AND THE PUBLIC.     ACCORDINGLY, IT IS MY DUTY TO REPORT THIS TO THE NHTSA AND TO SEEK THE NHTSA'S GUIDANCE ABOUT STEPS I CAN TAKE TO ENSURE THAT TOYOTA DOES NOT HAND ME BACK THE VEHICLE, WHICH MAY BE A DEATHTRAP. I DON'T USE SUCH INFLAMMATORY WORDS LIGHTLY, BUT THE MORE I CONTEMPLATE, THE MORE I FEEL THAT THIS WAS A POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING EVENT.",
