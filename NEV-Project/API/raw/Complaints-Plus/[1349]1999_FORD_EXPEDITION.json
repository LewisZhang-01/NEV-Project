IT IS NOT JUST A NOISE - YOU CAN FEEL IT THROUGH THE STEERING WHEEL AND IT MAKES THE WHOLE TRUCK JERK AROUND. IT IS ALMOST LIKE MY FRONT WHEELS ARE DRIVING OVER GOLF BALL-SIZED ROCKS.     THE PROBLEM STARTED VERY SUDDENLY, AND IT IS SOMEWHAT INTERMITTENT - BUT IT IS BECOMING MORE FREQUENT AS TIME GOES ON. I HAD IT IN TO THE FORD GARAGE TWICE NOW, AND IT JUST DOES NOT WANT TO ACT UP WHEN A TECHNICIAN IN  THE VEHICLE. SINCE I CAN'T ALWAYS MAKE IT HAPPEN, I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT A MECHANICAL PROBLEM (LIKE A U-JOINT OR CV JOINT). IT IS EITHER REALLY BAD OR NON-EXISTENT. ALSO, I DO NOT NOTICE ANY MAJOR SYMPTOMS WHILE DRIVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE, ALTHOUGH I SOMETIMES DO HEAR A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE FROM THE FRONT END WHILE TRAVELING ABOVE 40 MPH. THIS NOISE IS ALSO INTERMITTENT, AND IT SOUNDS SOMEWHAT LIKE A WHEEL BEARING GOING OUT (THEY CHECKED OUT OK).     WHEN I FIRST EXPERIENCED THE JUMPY FRONT END WHILE TAKING CORNERS, I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT THAT THE TRUCK HAD BEEN SWITCHED INTO 4WD. THE JERKY, CLUNKY BEHAVIOR OF THE FRONT END IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO HOW THE TRUCK ACTS WHEN YOU RUN IN 4WD ON DRY PAVEMENT. I HAVE PUT THE TRUCK INTO 4WD TO TEST THIS THEORY, AND THE PROBLEM IS SIMILAR, BUT MUCH WORSE WHEN I FORCE THE TRANSFER CASE INTO 4WD. ONE OF THE MOST NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCES IS HOW THE TRUCK ACTS WHEN I FIRST START TO MOVE. IN 4WD, THE TRUCK IS MUCH MORE HESITANT TO START MOVING - IT WILL NOT EVEN CREEP FORWARD IN IDLE. ONCE I START TO MOVE, HOWEVER, THE TRUCK JERKS AROUND JUST LIKE I DESCRIBED ABOVE.  *TR",

THIS SITUATION PLACED MY FAMILY IN HARM'S WAY AS IT OCCURRED ON THE INTERSTATE AND WAS QUITE STARTLING. THE SERVICE REP WAS ABLE TO TELL ME WHAT WAS WRONG WITH MY VEHICLE AS SOON AS TOLD HIM THE MAKE AND MODEL. THE REPAIR COST IS SIGNIFICANT, BUT THE POTENTIAL FOR AN UNDER HOOD FIRE CAUSED BY THE FUEL VAPORS BEING IGNITED BY THE EJECTED PLUG IS OF GRAVE CONCERN. FORD IS KEENLY AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND HAS DESIGNED A REPLACEMENT HEAD FOR THE VEHICLE, BUT REFUSES TO DO THE HONORABLE THING AND REPLACE IT AT THEIR EXPENSE. THEY INSTEAD CHOOSE TO PROFIT FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS BY CHARGING THEM FOR THE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF THE CYLINDER HEADS. I FIND IT PREDATORIAL THAT A CAR COMPANY WOULD MAKE A FAULTY PRODUCT AND THEN PROFIT FROM THE REPAIR OF SAID PRODUCT. THIS COULD START A NEW PRECEDENT BY SIGNALING TO OTHER CAR COMPANIES THAT IF YOU SELL A DEFECTIVE VEHICLE, YOU CAN MAKE MONEY ON THE BACKSIDE BY CHARGING FOR THE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF THAT PART.     THE SAFETY CONCERNS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FAILURE ARE RELATED TO THE LOUD AND SUDDEN POPPING SOUND WHEN THE PLUG EJECTS, THIS COULD EASILY DISTRACT A DRIVER AND COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO A FATAL ACCIDENT. THE FUEL VAPORS COULD BE IGNITED SHORTLY AFTER THE PLUG EJECTS AND COULD ALSO CAUSE THE DRIVER TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.

ON FEBRUARY 19, 2008, AT APPROXIMATELY 11PM, MY VEHICLE  SUDDENLY BURST INTO FLAMES, WHILE JUST SITTING PARKED IN OUR DRIVEWAY.  THE FIRE WAS UNDERHOOD AND AS WE TRIED TO EXTINGUISH IT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND LOCAL POLICE SHOWED UP AND THEY HAD TO PUT IT OUT.  ENCLOSED YOU WILL FIND A COPY  OF THE INCIDENT REPORT AND WILL NOTE THAT THERE ARE REASONS FOR US TO BELIEVE THAT THE RECALL ISSUE AND THE DESTRUCTION OF MY VEHICLE ARE DEFINITELY LINKED. UNFORTUNATELY FOR US, WE DID NOT RECEIVE THIS LETTER FROM YOU UNTIL THE FIRST WEEK IN MARCH 2008. MY VEHICLE WAS FINANCED AND THERE WAS AN OUTSTANDING BALANCE THAT WAS REQUIRED TO BE PAID OFF IMMEDIATELY BY MY LENDER. THEREFORE, BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION AT HAND AND THE LAPSE OF TIME IN WHICH THE NOTICE ARRIVED AFTER THE FIRE OCCURRED I FEEL THAT FORD MOTOR HAS A FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND IS LIABLE FOR THE COSTS I HAVE INCURRED AS A RESULT.

THE VEHICLE STALLED AFTER I LET OFF THE GAS PEDAL RIGHT AFTER A LOUD BANG AND POPPING SOUND WAS HEARD IN ENGINE.  I WAS ABLE TO RESTART VEHICLE, BUT HAD TO KEEP THE RPM'S UP TO KEEP FROM STALLING.  AFTER CUTTING OFF SEVERAL CARS IN CENTER AND RIGHT LANE, THE VEHICLE WAS PULLED INTO A PARKING LOT ON RIGHT SIDE OF ROAD.  I DETECTED A STRONG SMELL OF GASOLINE PRESENT WHEN HOOD WAS RAISED.  NOT ONCE DID THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT COME ON; UNLIKE ALL THE OTHER TIMES IT CAME ON WHEN NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE TRUCK.  THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A FORD DEALER AND A $3400 HEAD REPLACEMENT PERFORMED BECAUSE HEAD WAS RUINED BY STRIPPED SPARK PLUG EJECTING.  UPON CHECKING INTERNET, I FOUND THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING INCREASING PROBLEM.      IT APPEARS THAT AN INQUIRY DONE BY YOUR AGENCY CONCLUDED IN JANUARY OF 2006 THAT THIS IS A RARELY OCCURRING INCIDENT OF LITTLE TO NO DANGER.  I BEG TO DIFFER.  A SIMPLE GOOGLE QUERY WILL SHOW THOUSANDS IF NOT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS REGARDING FORD TRITON ENGINE SPARK PLUG PROBLEMS POSTED ON VARIOUS MESSAGE BOARDS.  IT IS A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT OR KILLED EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THIS OBVIOUS PROBLEM.  I'M JUST GLAD I WAS ALONE DRIVING AND NOT MY WIFE AND CHILDREN.  MY WIFE WOULD HAVE REMAINED IN THE STALLED VEHICLE WHILE SITTING IN THE PASSING LANE.    CONSIDERING THE ENORMOUS NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY AFFECTED VEHICLE THIS ISSUE INVOLVES, I WILL ALSO BE BRINGING THIS MATTER TO THE ATTENTION OF EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL I CAN SEND AN EMAIL TO.  *JB",

WE HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO NEWPORT FORD IN MIDDLETOWN, RHODE ISLAND.  THEY SHOWED ME THE RUPTURE SITE, AND THE RUST OVER THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF STEEL TUBING.  THEY INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE TUBING TO ALL FOUR (4)WHEELS, FOR A COST OF OVER $700.   THEY ALSO INDICATED TO ME THAT THIS TYPE OF FAILURE IS QUITE COMMON. THE DEALERSHIP HANDLES ABOUT 2-3 INCIDENTS PER MONTH.  I ASKED WHY THE TUBING WAS NOT COPPER, AND THEY INDICATED THAT MANY AMERICAN CAR MANUFACTURERS HAVE SWITCHED FROM COPPER TO STEEL.

I HAVE TWO COMMENTS.   ONE IS THAT IF THIS FAILURE IS AS COMMON AS I WAS TOLD, I WOULD HOPE THERE WOULD BE A MAJOR POLICY CHANGE AND A RECALL.  CARS OFTEN RECALLED, FOR RATHER MINOR ISSUES, AND I THINK THIS IS MUCH MORE SERIOUS.   *JB",

THE VEHICLE CONTINUED TO RUN AND A CONSTANT POPPING SOUND COULD BE HEARD.  SHE IMMEDIATELY SHUT OFF THE ENGINE AND NOTICED A VERY STRONG GAS/EXHAUST TYPE SMELL.  SHE CALLED ME AND I ARRIVED TO CHECK THE VEHICLE OUT.  I INSPECTED ALL THE FLUID LEVELS AND FUSES AND THEY WERE FINE.  I BRIEFLY STARTED THE ENGINE WITH THE HOOD OPEN TO HELP NARROW THE LOCATION OF THE SOUND.  THE SOUND WAS COMING FROM THE TOP OF THE ENGINE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  I STARTED INSPECTING THIS AREA AND FOUND THAT THE THIRD SPARK PLUG FROM THE FRONT OF THE ENGINE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY BLOWN OUT OF THE HEAD OF THE ENGINE.  IT IS VERY FORTUNATE THAT THIS OCCURRED IN A PARKING LOT.  MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WERE BOTH VERY STARTLED BY THE LOUD  EXPLOSION AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THIS HAD OCCURRED ON THE ROAD AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED.  I BELIEVE THAT AN ACCIDENT WOULD HAVE RESULTED.  I HAVE SINCE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND HAVE LEARNED THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS ON FORD VEHICLES AND HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE NHTSA.

SO I TOOK IT TO MY MECHANIC, AND HE LOOKED AT IT.  THERE WAS BRAKE FLUID UP IN THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH, ALL THE WAY UP IN THE CABLE HARNESS (IN THE WIRES), AND IN THE CONNECTOR AT THE JUNCTION/FUSE BOX.  WHEN HE REMOVED THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH, HE DISCOVERED THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH WAS THE NEW SWITCH AND IT SPARKED AND IT CAUGHT FIRE.  LUCKILY THE FLAME WAS CONTAINED TO JUST THE SWITCH AND THE MECHANIC WAS ABLE TO CUT THE SWITCH OUT OF THE CAR AND BLOW IT OUT BEFORE THE FIRE SPREAD.  HE TOLD ME THE CAR HAD TO GO TO FORD AND HE SUGGESTED THAT I NOT DRIVE IT, AS IT WAS A FIRE HAZARD.  SO IT WAS TOWED.  THE FORD DEALERSHIP GOT IN AND INVESTIGATED AND THEY DETERMINED THAT I NEEDED A WHOLE NEW CABLING HARNESS BECAUSE OF MELTED WIRES AND BRAKE FLUID CONTAMINATION AND THAT THE PRICE WAS GOING TO BE $500 AND A NEW CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH AND FUSES.  I INSTRUCTED FORD TO GO AHEAD WITH THE REPAIRS AND TO SAVE ALL OF THE OLD PARTS.  FORD SAID THAT BECAUSE THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH HAD ALREADY BEEN REPLACED, THIS VEHICLE WAS NOT SUBJECT TO THE RECALL DESPITE THE ENTIRE LIST OF OTHER COINCIDENTAL FAILURES THAT COULD HAVE LED TO A FIRE AND POSSIBLE LOSS OF LIFE.    I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT HAD THE OLD SWITCH STILL BEEN IN PLACE, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A FIRE ALREADY.  AS THINGS WERE, MY MECHANIC JOE TAYLOR, AT TAYLOR'S AUTOMOTIVE SAID IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THIS ONE WOULD GO UP.",

THE THIRD TIME IT HAPPENED, WE WENT TO OUR LOCAL GARAGE AND THE GUY SAID THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM, WELL KNOWN TO AUTO MECHANICS, BUT THAT THE INDIVIDUAL FAILING CYLINDER COULD NOT BE READILY DIAGNOSED BY THE COMPUTER CODES, SO IT WAS AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR BECAUSE THEY MIGHT HAVE TO TRY ALL 8 COIL PACKS TO LOCATE AND IDENTIFY THE OFFENDER.

SHE HAD BEEN HOME ABOUT 45 MINUTES WHEN I NOTICED THE SMELL OF SMOKE. I LOOKED OUT THE DOOR TO THE GARAGE AND SAW FLAMES COMING OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD NEAR THE WINDSHIELD. I QUICKLY TOOK THE KEYS AND TRIED TO CRANK IT TO GET IT OUT OF THE GARAGE AND AWAY FROM THE HOUSE. FORTUNATELY IT DID CRANK.  AFTER I ATTEMPTED TO PUT THE FIRE OUT WITH A FIRE EXTINQUISHER THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT PUT OUT THE FIRE. THE CAR WAS DECLARED A TOTAL LOSS BY MY INSURANCE COMPANY A COUPLE DAYS LATER.  I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THIS FIRE WAS CAUSED BY A FAULTY CRUISE-CONTROL DE-SELECTOR SWITCH.  THE CRUISE-CONTROL HAD STOPPED WORKING ABOUT 4 OR 5 MONTHS AGO. AFTER THE FIRE I NOTICED A PUDDLE OF FLUID ON OUR GARAGE FLOOR.  I NOW KNOW THAT WAS BRAKE FLUID FROM THE MASTER CYLINDER.  I CALLED MONTGOMERY MOTORS SERVICE DEPARTMENT ON TUESDAY JANUARY 25TH AND THEY SAID THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS PROBLEM WITH EXPEDITIONS.  TWO DAYS LATER FORD ANNOUNCES A RECALL ON CERTAIN YEAR MODEL EXPEDITIONS (NOT 1999). I'M UPSET THAT FORD KNEW OF THIS PROBLEM AND DID NOTHING ABOUT UNTIL THERE WERE OVER 63 FIRES (NOT COUNTING THIS ONE). AND NOW THEY ARE ONLY RECALLING A FEW YEAR MODELS WHEN IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH 1997 THRU 2002 MODELS. I WAS VERY FORTUNATE THAT MY HOME AND FAMILY WAS NOT BURNED UP IN THIS FIRE.  SOME OTHER FAMILIES MAY NOT BE AS LUCKY.  THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS DANGEROUS PROBLEM. *AK",

I HAVE READ OF OVER 53 OTHER COMPALINTS FOR THE SAME PROBLEM AND QUESTION WHY FORD HAS NOT RECALLED THIS PROBLEM. IT ALL COMES DOWN TO ECONOMICS, I FEEL THE ARE QUICK TO FIX SMALL PROBLEMS I.E...

IWOULD LIKE TO SEE N.H.T.S.A FORCE FORD TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM. IF PEOPLE ARE SPENDING OVER 25,000 FOR A VEHICLE THEY SHOULD HAVE THE PIECE AND MIND THAT THEIR FAMILIES WILL LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO PAY OFF THE VEHICLE. MY POINT IS THAT I AM A U.S. MARINE AND MY LIFE IS AT DANGER WHENEVER WE GO OFF TO WAR AND ITS A POSSIABILTY THAT MY LIFE CAN BE ENDED BY A SINGLE BULLET, AND I AM WILLING TO MAKE THAT SACARFICE. BUT I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD BE ASK TO DIE IN MY VEHICLE ON THE OPEN ROADS IN THE LAND OF THE FREE. THE WAY I SEE IT FORD IS WILLING TO SAVE A FEW DOLLARS BY NOT ACCEPTING RESPONSIABITY OF THIS KNOWN DEFECT. BUT MY WIFE, 5 YEAR OLD DAUGTER, 3 YEAR OLD SON, AND 2 YEAR OLD SON SHOULD MEAN ALOT MORE THAN $1800- $5000 SAVED BY THEM NOT FIXING THE PROBLEM.

I SPENT MANY HOURS ON THE PHONE WITH FORD, BUT WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NOT HELP.  FEELING STUCK, I WENT AHEAD AND AUTHORIZED MY MECHANIC TO GO AHEAD AND FIX THE HEAD GASKET AT OUR EXPENSE (OF NEARLY $2000)!  UNFORTUNATELY, THIS NIGHTMARE ONLY GOT WORSE!  YESTERDAY, MY MECHANIC INFORMED ME THAT WHILE TEARING DOWN THE ENGINE TO GET TO THE HEAD GASKET, HE DETERMINED THAT THE TIMING CHAIN HAS WORN CLEAR INTO THE GUIDES/TENSIONERS.  HE (AND 2 OTHER QUALIFIED MECHANICS) HAVE STATED THAT THERE IS NO EXPLANATION FOR THIS OTHER THAN DEFECTIVE MANUFACTURING.  THERE IS NOTHING I COULD HAVE DONE TO HAVE CAUSED THIS.  THE COST TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL $1500, NOW PUTTING MY TOTAL AT NEARLY $3500!  BOTH THE MECHANIC AND I SPENT MUCH OF YESTERDAY ON THE TELEPHONE (YET AGAIN) WITH FORD, BUT THEY ARE STILL REFUSING TO TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE FAULTY ENGINES!

THE CONDITION   STARTED OCCURRING IN THE FALL OF 2002 WHEN THE VEHICLE HAD   APPROXIMATELY 75,000 MILES ON THE ODOMETER.  SINCE THAT TIME,   THE MIRRORS HAVE GOTTEN PROGRESSIVELY WORSE.   *JB",

NOW HERE IT IS AUG 2003 AND THE ENGINE IS KNOCKING! I TOOK IT STRAIGHT TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAID YEP SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE GOT EITHER A BAD BEARING OR SOME KIND OF ROD WAS BAD???? HELLO???? THEN I WAS TOLD TO BRING IN BACK IN A FEW DAYS THAT THEY COULDNT INSPECT IT COMPLETELY AT THE MOMENT. THEN I WAS TOLD NOT TO BE DRIVING IT, OK HOW DO I GET IT HOME IF I CANT DRIVE IT? HOW DO I GET IT BACK IN A FEW DAYS IF I CANT DRIVE IT? I PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR THIS PIECE OF JUNK, WHY SHOULD I PAY $20,000 FOR A VEHICLE AND HAVE TO PAY ANOTHER $5,000 IN 6 MONTHS JUST TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE IT AGAIN? WHATS UP WITH FORD? ARE THEY SO HARD UP FOR MONEY THAT THEY HAVE TO SHAFT THEIR CUSTOMERS? WAY TO GO FORD!! KEEP UP THE SHAFTY WORK WE ALL (CUSTOMERS) LIKE TO PAY $20,000 + FOR A HUNK OF JUNK THAT WE HAVE TO KEEP PUTTING MONEY INTO. I CANT BELIEVE IM PAYING PAYMENTS ON A VEHICLE THAT I CANT EVEN DRIVE, THAT REALLY SUCKS. TO BAD THERE ISN'T ANYBODY THAT CAN MAKE FORD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE BAD MOTORS AND ALL THE OTHER PROBLEMS THEY ARE HAVING, YES I WORK EVERYDAY TO PAY FOR THIS LEMON VEHICLE AND WHATS EVEN WORSE IS THAT I HAVE TO BUM A RIDE TO WORK, NOW THATS SAD WITH A NICE EXPENSIVE VEHICLE SITTING IN MY GARAGE.*AK",

THIS DIDNOT WORK AS MY TORQUE CONVERTOR NEEDED REPLACING. THE GENTLEMAN AT AAMCO CALLED AN OUT OF AREA FORD DEALER AND TOLD THEM THAT THE MILEAGE WAS TOO LOW AND THE CAR TO EXPENSIVE FOR THESE KIND OF TROUBLES. THIS DEALER REPLACED TORQUE CONVERTOR UNDER WARRANTY, BUT IT IS DOING IT AGAIN. AS YOU CAN SEE, THE MILEAGE AT WHICH IT WAS FIRST REPAIRED (37000) UNTIL NOW(48000), ONLY MEANS THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM EVERY 10 OR 11K MILES. THIS WAS MY FIRST MAJOR PROBLEM BUT IN THE PAST, THIS CAR HAS SHUT DOWN COMPLETELY, NOT REGISTERED ANY OIL AND BECAUSE IT IS A SOUTHERN COMFORT LIMITED EDITION MODEL IT HAS A TV-VCR COMBO THAT WORKED FOR A FEW MONTHS AND IT WENT OUT. I HAVE YET TO FIND A REPAIR PERSON FOR THIS PROBLEM. FORD KNEW OF THIS TRANSMISSION PROBLEM AND TRIED TO COVER IT UP. I DO NOT WISH TO CONTINUE TRAVELING LONG DISTANCES TO FIND AN HONEST FORD REPAIR DEALERSHIP WHEN THIS CAR IS NOTHING BUT A LEMON. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ANY HELP YOU MIGHT GIVE ME.

AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT MY PROBLEM WITH THE TIRES IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE PROBLEM PEOPLE ARE HAVING WITH THE FIRESTONE TIRES. TO GET A SECOND OPINION I WENT DOWN TO A PRIVATELY OWNED GOODYEAR SHOP; THE MANAGER, AFTER INSPECTING ONE OF THE TIRES, WHICH ALL HAD THE SAME PROBLEM, TOLD ME THAT THE TIRES HAD DEFECTS IN THEM AND THAT WE SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CALL THE GOODYEAR HOTLINE. HE ALSO HAPPENED TO AGREE THAT THE TIRES WOULD EVENTUALLY RIP OFF AND FLIP THE CAR IF I DID NOT CHANGE THEM. HENCE I CALLED THE GOODYEAR HOTLINE, WHEN THE REPRESENTATIVE PICKED UP, SHE TOLD ME THAT THE MAN FROM GOODYEAR WHO INSPECTED THE TIRES WAS NOT QUALIFIED TO GIVE AN INSPECTION. SO THEN, I DROVE TO ANOTHER SHOP NAMED !0JUST TIRES!1 THAT WAS LICENSED FROM GOODYEAR TO GIVE INSPECTIONS. AFTER INSPECTING THE TIRES, THE MANAGER AGREED THERE WAS A DEFECT IN THE TIRES AND THAT IF THE TIRES WERE NOT IMMEDIATELY REPLACED I WOULD BE ENDANGERING MY LIFE. HE TOO BELIEVED THAT MY TIRES HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS TO THOSE OF FIRESTONE.I HAVE ALSO HAD ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH THE EXPEDITION.

HOWEVER, AFTER A FEW MONTHS, THE NEWLY INSTALLED MIRROR STARTED BECAME SOMEWHAT UNRELIABLE. IT ACCUMULATED SCRATCHES EASILY AND WAS VERY FRAGILE. THE VISUALS THE MIRROR GAVE WERE VERY DULL AND VAGUE. HENCE WHEN WE WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR ANOTHER REPLACEMENT, THE REPRESENTATIVE TOLD US THAT THE MIRROR WAS NO LONGER COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY; AND SO I WAS NOT GIVEN A REPLACEMENT.  *AK (DOT NUMBER: PDCUD3ER33  TIRESIZE: P255/70R16)",

THIS ACCIDENT HAPPENED WITHIN 15 FT.ON THE POLICE REPORT IT STATES THAT THE POWER STEERING LOCKED UP BUT DUE TO NO WITNESSES HE CAN'T PROVE THIS. BODYSHOP SAID THE GEAR BOX AND ALL THE GEARS ARE DESTROYED AND BECAUSE OF IT LOCKING UP TO THE RIGHT WHEN I WAS MAKING A LEFT IT LOOKS LIKE THE POWER STEERING LOCKED UP ALSO. FORD WILL NOT COMMENT ON MY SITUATION AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT TO DO TO PROTECT MYSELF IF THIS IS A DEFECT PROBLEM. ON THE TRANSMISSION, I TOOK IT TO FORD AND TOLD THEM MY TRUCK WAS SLIPPING AND HAVING PROBLEMS AND THEY REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION AND FIXED SOME ENGINE PROBLEMS. I HAVE SO MANY THINGS GO WRONG ON THIS VEHICLE SINCE 1999 I'M AFRAID TO EVEN DRIVE IT ONCE IT IS FIXED. I\"M NOT SURE IT IS SAFE FOR ME AND MY FAMILY. PLEASE ADVISE ME IF YOU CAN OR LET ME KNOW WHAT YOUR PROCESS IS ON THIS COMPLAINT.  *AK",

FIRESTONE WOULD NOT REPLACE THE TIRES FREE OF CHARGE I GUESS IN DOING THIS THEY WOULD NOT ADMIT TO ANY DEFAULT WITH THE TIRE OR WITH THEIE WORKMANSHIP.  THE ONLY THING FIRESTONE WOULD DO FOR ME WAS TO REPLACE ALL FOUR TIRES UNDER A PRO-RATING SYSTEM.

THE DEPTH OF THE TIRES WERE MEASURED BY THE FIRESTONE DEALER AND ALL FOUR TIRES CAME IN AT 10/32.  THE TIRES BEFORE COMING OFF OF MY VEHICLE WERE DOCUMENTED BY THE FIRESTONE DEALER ON SOME FORM WHICH I HAD TO SIGN.  ON THIS FORM, THE SERIAL NUMBERS OF ALL FOUR TIRES WERE LISTED AND THE THEIR ACTUAL POSITION ON THE VEHICLE.  THE REPLACEMENT TIRES FIRESTONE PROVIDED WERE AGAIN THEIR WILDERNESS AT'S AND SAME SIZE.

WAS TOLD BY FORD SERVICE REP. THAT IT WAS DUE TO THE TRUCK'S HAVING BEEN IDLE IN THE HOT SUN/PARKING LOT PRIOR TO MY PURCHASING IT. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD DISSIPATE IN TIME. IT DID NOT. I BROUGHT IT IN THREE TIMES SINCE THEN. EACH TIME I ASKED THAT THE CAUSE BE FIXED AND NOT JUST THE SYMPTOMS. ON THE 4TH VISIT, I INVOLVED THE OWNER AND HIS DEALERSHIP HIRED AN OUTSIDE COMPANY TO REMOVE THE MOLD FROM THE SYSTEM. THEY CLAIMED TO HAVE DONE SO BUT DURING THE CLEANING PROCESS THEY ADDED A CHEMICAL/PERFUME THAT IS SO STRONG, ONE CANNOT TELL IF THE ACTUAL PROBLEM IS STILL PRESENT OR NOT. I WAS TOLD (BY THE SERVICE REP) THE OWNER WAS SO OFFENDED BY THIS SMELL THAT HE HAD THE COMPANY COME BACK OUT & REDO THE TRUCK TO REMOVE THE ADDED CHEMICAL. THEY WERE UNSUCCESSFUL AS IT SMELLS VERY STRONG EVEN TODAY (2 WEEKS LATER). MY CONCERN IS AS FOLLOWS; IF THEY REMOVED THE MOLD AND SMELL THEN WHY WOULD THEY NEED TO ADD A CHEMICAL/PERFUME? I BELIEVE THAT THEY ADDED THIS CHEMICAL TO MASK THE FACT THAT THE MOLD IS STILL PRESENT. I THINK THAT ALL THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WAS OVERPOWER THE STENCH OF MOLD  BY ADDING THIS FRAGRANCE.

AFTER THE NOISE, MY KIDS LOOKED BACK AND SAW WHAT THEY DESCRIBED AS SMOKE AND DEBRIS FLYING BEHIND THE CAR. FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABLE TO STEER THE VEHICLE TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD WITHOUT AN ACCIDENT. I GOT EVERYONE OUT OF THE CAR AND WE CALLED THE AUTO CLUB ON OUR CELL PHONE TO COME FIX THE FLAT. I LOOKED AT THE FLAT TIRE, AND I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO SEE THE NATURE OF THE FLAT. THE TIRE SIDEWALL WAS TOTALLY DISINTEGRATED, BUT THE TIRE TREAD REMAINED IS ONE ROUND PIECE. I JACKED UP THE CAR AND REMOVED THE WHEEL, AND THE SEPARATED TREAD THAT SURROUNDED THE ALUMINUM WHEEL. I LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE SEPARATED TREAD, EXPECTING TO SEE A NAIL OR SOME OTHER EVIDENCE OF A PUNCTURE. THERE WASN\u0012T ANY PUNCTURE OR HOLE IN THE TREAD. I THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY UNUSUAL SO I TOOK SOME PHOTOS RIGHT THERE. THEN I CHANGED THE TIRE AND PUT THE WHEEL AND SEPARATED TREAD IN MY CAR. THE AUTO CLUB TOW TRUCK ARRIVED JUST AS I WAS COMPLETING THE CHANGE.   THE DAY AFTER THE INCIDENT, I WENT TO A FIRESTONE DEALER IN ROSEVILLE, CALIFORNIA AND BROUGHT THE WHEEL AND THE SEPARATED TREAD. I WAS PRETTY UPSET AND REQUESTED A FREE REPLACEMENT BECAUSE IT APPEARED TO ME TO BE A DEFECTIVE TIRE. HOWEVER, THE MAN AT THE FIRESTONE DEALERSHIP SAID IT WAS \u0013ROAD HAZARD\u0014 AND THAT WARRANTY DID NOT APPLY. I COMMENTED TO MY SON AFTERWARDS THAT HE SEEMED ALMOST PRE-PROGRAMMED FOR THAT RESPONSE. I WASN\u0012T HAPPY WITH THEIR ATTITUDE AT FIRESTONE SO I WENT TO THE CLOSEST FORD DEALERSHIP. THEY WERE NICER ABOUT IT, AND AGREED THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A TIRE PROBLEM, BUT THEY SAID FORD DOESN\u0012T WARRANT TIRES ON NEW CARS. I ENDED UP JUST BUYING A REPLACEMENT WILDERNESS AT IN REDDING THE NEXT DAY BECAUSE THAT WAS OUR VACATION DESTINATION.

I LOOKED BACK TO SEE WHAT IT WAS THAT I WAS HEARING AND REALIZED HE WAS CHOKING.  EVENFLO APOLOGIZED AND MENTIONED THAT THE NEW CAR SEAT COVER HAD A SPECIAL DESIGN SO THAT IT COULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.  I MENTIONED THAT THEY SHOULD PUT OUT A WARNING OR RECALL BECAUSE IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANOTHER PARENT AND THEY MIGHT NOT BE SO FORTUNATE.  CHILDREN OF THIS YOUNG AGE ARE VERY ORAL.  IT CAN HAPPEN AGAIN.  IN FACT I HAD WARNED ONE OF MY FRIENDS OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE SHE HAD THE SAME COVER AND IT WAS NOT ON SECURELY(LIKE MINE) ANYMORE.  TWO DAYS LATER SHE FOUND A WAD OF THE FIBERFILL IN HER YOUNG DAUGHTERS MOUTH.  SHE IMMEDIATELY PULLED IT OUT AND I MIGHT ADD, WAS AS SHOCKED AS I WAS.  EVENFLO'S RESPONSE WAS TO SAY THANK YOU FOR LETTING US KNOW, WE'LL BRING IT UP AT THE NEXT MEETING.  THEY ALSO SAID THEY TAKE THEIR JOB SERIOUSLY BUT COULDN'T LET ME KNOW IF A RECALL WOULD HAPPEN.
