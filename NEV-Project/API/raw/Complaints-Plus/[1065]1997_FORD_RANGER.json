FORCE FORD TO BUYBACK THE TRUCKS AT KBB VALUE, OR REPLACE THE RUSTY FRAMES WITH NEW ONES FREE OF CHARGE.

ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION GASOLINE WAS OBSERVED DRIPPING FROM THE AREA UNDER THE FUEL TANK AFTER THE VEHICLE WAS FILLED WITH GASOLINE. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE 2001-2002 TIME FRAME. *AK    2) IN LATE APRIL OF THIS YEAR 2004, THE CHECK ENGINE WARNING DASHBOARD WARNING LIGHT CAME ON, AND I HAD THE COMPUTER CODE CHECKED TO DETERMINE IF I COULD MAKE THE REPAIRS MYSELF.  THE PROBLEM WAS THE FUEL FILTER, AND WHEN I REPLACED IT I NOTICED A GREAT DEAL OF DIRT AND DEBRIS COMING FROM THE INLET SIDE OF THE FILTER.  THIS INDICATED TO ME THAT THE FUEL TANK WAS PROBABLY CONTAMINATED, AND I REMOVED THE TANK SATURDAY, MAY 15, TO CLEAN THE TANK.  PRIOR TO REINSTALLING THE TANK, I EXAMINED THE GASOLINE FILLER TUBE, AND FOUND THREE CRACKS IN THE VAPOR RECOVERY TUBE THAT VENTS GASOLINE VAPORS TO THE FILLING STATION VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEM.  ONE OF THESE CRACKS WAS QUITE LARGE, AND SHOWED INDICATIONS OF GASOLINE LEAKING FROM THIS CRACK.  NOT ONLY WAS THE CRACK THE SOURCE OF THE GASOLINE THAT LEAKED FROM THE SYSTEM, IT WAS ALSO THE ENTRY POINT FOR THE DEBRIS AND MOISTURE I FOUND IN THE TANK.  IN ADDITION, THE GASOLINE THAT RAN FROM THE CRACK IN THE RECOVERY TUBE ACCUMULATED IN A PLASTIC SKID PLATE THAT IS LOCATED UNDER THE TANK.     3) I OF COURSE REPLACE THE TUBE ASSEMBLY, AT A COST OF $262.29.  I CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE REPLACEMENT PARTS.  THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO BE THE LEAST BIT INTEREST IN THE PROBLEM AND REFUSED TO COMPENSATE THE EXPENSES.  I HAVE RETAINED THE OLD PART, AND HAVE SEVERAL PHOTOS OF THE DEFECT.",

MY HEAD AND RIGHT SIDE OF MY BODY SMASHED AGAINST THE STEERING WHEEL, AND MY I BROKE MY LEFT COLLAR BONE, FRACTURED AND BRUISED SEVERAL RIBS ON MY RIGHT SIDE, BROKE MY RIGHT FOOT HEEL BONE, CUT MY NOSE, PLUS NUMEROUS OTHER MINOR CUTS, BRUISES AND ABRASIONS.  AFTER ABOUT 45 SECONDS, A HUGE BALL OF FIRE ERUPTED FROM UNDER THE CRUMPLED HOOD.  I FELT THE SUDDEN HEAT ON MY FACE, SINCE THE WINDSHIELD WAS GONE AND THERE WAS A HUGE GAP BETWEEN THE HOOD AND THE TRUCKS BODY.   A LADY, AN ANGEL OF GOD REALLY, HELPED ME OUT OF THE TRUCK AND INTO THE BACK SEAT OF HER CAR.  SHE DROVE ABOUT 100 YARDS TO WAIT FOR THE AMBULANCE TO ARRIVE.  BEFORE WE CAME TO A STOP, I HEARD THE TWO FRONT TIRES OF MY TRUCK BLOW UP.  ALL I COULD SEE WAS A BALL OF FIRE BURNING ABOUT 20 FEET HIGH.  TWO THINGS SEEM TECHNICALLY WRONG:  THE AIR BAGS DIDN'T DEPLOY, AND THE FUEL PUMP MUST HAVE KEPT PUMPING FUEL, FOR THE FIRE TO SPREAD SO RAPIDLY AND BURN THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK SO VERY COMPLETELY.  THIS WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THE POSSIBLE FAILURE OF THE AIR BAG CRASH SENSORS AND THE FUEL PUMP SAFETY CUTOFF SWITCH.  MY TIRES WERE ONE MONTH OLD MICHELINS, SO THEY WEREN'T A FACTOR.  THE TRUCK WAS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE AND IT WAS CAREFULLY MAINTAINED AND GARAGED.  EVERYTHING WORKED ON IT AND NO MALFUNCTION INDICATOR LIGHTS OF ANY KIND WERE ON PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.  I HAVE VERY GOOD MAINTENANCE RECORDS ON IT.  I CONTACTED FORD BY TELEPHONE AND VIA E-MAIL, TO LET THEM KNOW OF WHAT I THOUGHT COULD BE A POTENTIAL COMPONENT DEFECT AFFECTING OTHERS ALSO.

THE PROBLEM WITH THIS PART  IS THAT IS NOT SAFE . WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL IS TAKEN OFF OF THE SPLINED SHAFT  THE NEW PIECE IS PUT ON AND DOES NOT  EVEN HAVE A SPLINED CENTER TO FIT TIGHT ON THE SHAFT AND THE ONLY OTHER THING TO HOLD IT TIGHT IS 2 SET SCREWS. IF ONE OF THESE SET SCREWS WOULD WORK LOSE OR IF THE STEERING WHEEL  WERE TURNED TO HARD  THESE SET SCREWS  WOULD WORK LOOSE  AND THE  STEERING WHEEL WOULD TURN BUT THE WHEELS WOULDN'T , OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND . I HAVE  TALKED TO A AUTO REPAIR SPECIALIST ALONG WITH THE HEAD MECHANIC SUPERVISOR AT A FORD DEALERSHIP AND BOTH MEN SAID THAT THIS PART IS NOT VERY SAFE AND THEY WOULD NT WANT IT ON THEIR CAR OR TRUCK , I ALSO  TALKED TO THE PERSON WHO INSTALLED THIS PART  HE NO LONGER USES THIS ALUMINUM PART BECAUSE IT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH  FOR THIS KIND OF STRESS THAT A STEERING WHEEL GOES THROUGH . I  HOPE THAT YOU CAN MAKE THESE PARTS REPLACED  BY THE COMPANIES SO THAT NO ONE WITH A MODIFIED HANDICAPPED STEERING COLUMN EXTENSION DOES NOT GET KILLED OR KILL SOMEONE ELSE , I WAS LUCKY TO FIND IT EARLY  BUT MAYBE SOME ONE ELSE WON'T BE.

I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND THEY STATED THE FRAME OF THE SEAT BROKE AND THAT I NEED A NEW SEAT. I AM WAITING FOR AN ESTIMATED COST FROM THEM. THEY ALSO STATE THIS IS NOT COVERED BY THE EXTNDED WARRANTY. I AM UNABLE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE UNTIL THIS IS FIXED. I ONLY WEIGHT 170 LBS SO I DONT GIVE THE SEAT ANY UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF STRESS.  *AK",
