DURING THE PROCESS OF SHIFTING THE FORKLIFT BACK AND FORTH, THE WEIGHT WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE JACK STAND COUPLER AND METAL CAUSING IT TO FAIL. THE CONSUMERS FOOT WAS INJURED BECAUSE HE WAS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO THE TRAILER WHEN IT OCCURRED.  TWO OTHER INCIDENTS WERE DISCOVERED INVOLVING THE VERY SAME TRAILER, AND IN BOTH INSTANCES, THE JACK STAND WAS RIPPED OFF THE TRAILER, WITHOUT PROPER OR ADEQUATE INSPECTIONS BEING MADE TO THE JACK STAND COUPLET OR THE METAL RAIL TO WHICH IT WAS ATTACHED. THE TRAILER IN QUESTION WAS NOT DESIGNED TO BE OFF-LOADED WITHOUT IT BEING ATTACHED TO A TOW VEHICLE. *JB",
