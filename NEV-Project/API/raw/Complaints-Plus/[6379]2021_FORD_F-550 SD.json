        "summary": "While driving down the road at approximately 45 mph, under normal conditions, with no warning indicators the low fuel pressure light came on.  When the driver stopped the vehicle he lost all power and observed smoke emanating from the underside and hood of the vehicle.  Prior to him exiting the vehicle he observed flames shooting out from under the console towards his feet.  Upon exiting the vehicle I saw flames under the hood of the vehicle and utilized his supplied fire extinguisher to attempt to put the fire out.  This was futile and to our benefit he had a pressure washer and 119 gallons of water that he was able to put into action to subdue the fire.  Noting that the drivers side front fender melted off and a hole melted in the drivers side hood from the fire.  The entire engine compartment was burned as well as melted components and plastic in the passenger compartment of the vehicle from the fire.",
