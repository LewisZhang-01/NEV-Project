The car was up to date on its inspections and maintenance.  The breaks, though appropriately checked and tested, would take longer than normal to break the vehicle.  The seatbelt, if pulled hard enough, would easily dislodge from buckle, coming undone.   The driver of this vehicle collided as described above and due to the failure(s) of the safety mechanisms in place, resulted in the death of the driver. The driver was restrained with seatbelt, however dislodged from buckle upon impact and NO airbags deployed.   The issue(s) have been confirmed by the police report, the county police documented.   The vehicle has been inspected by police officers, and possibly others, including the employees of the towing company.   There was NO indication thats the airbag deployment was either \"off\" if possible, and or indications of airbag defect. No messages or lights were indicated for the failure of the deployment of the airbags. No messages or lights were indicated for the defect and or failure of the seatbelt not remaining intact with force.  The person in reference PASSED AWAY on impact at scene. The failures of the safety mechanisms put into place for this vehicle are absolutely unacceptable and beyond subpar.",

I WAS THEN PRESENTED WITH THE PRICE OF AROUND $9,500 THAT I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO PAY IF I CHOSE THIS OPTION.

THE TOYOTA REPRESENTATIVE EXPRESSED WITH THE CURRENT CONDITION OF THOSE PARTS I WILL NEED TO HAVE THEM REPLACED WITH THE COST STILL AT $9,500. MY THIRD OPTION WAS TO DECLINE THE RECALL AND DRIVE THE TRUCK AS IS WITH THE TRUCK DEEMED UNSAFE TO DRIVE BY THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP. THE TIME FRAME I WAS GIVEN TO MAKE A DECISION WAS SHORT OF NOTHING. I HAD TO MAKE A DECISION BY THE END OF THE PHONE CALL THAT MEANT SPENDING $9,500 OR DRIVE WITH AN UNSAFE VEHICLE THAT AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT COULD CAUSE A SERIOUS OR FATAL ACCIDENT. I WAS FORCED INTO DECLINING THE RECALL BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE $9,500 IN MY BANK ACCOUNT. ALSO, AFTER I CONCLUDED MY BUSINESS WITH THE DEALERSHIP, I PROCEEDED TO ASK THEM WHAT THE TRADE IN VALUE ON MY TRUCK WAS TO SEE IF BUYING ANOTHER VEHICLE WAS AN OPTION.

I HAD TO BABY THE TRUCK ABOUT A MILE AT VERY LOW SPEED TO GET BACK IN TO TOWN. THE STEERING WHEEL WAS/IS VERY DIFFICULT TO TURN. I \"COULD NOT\" MAKE A TYPICAL TURN AT VERY SLOW SPEED AND NOT USE THE OPPOSING SIDE OF THE ROAD. I GOT THE TRUCK HOME AND SHUT IT DOWN. I SUSPECTED A POWER STEERING LEAK AND CHECKED TO FIND IT WAS OUT OF FLUID. I USED MY FRIENDS VEHICLE TO BUY POWER STEERING FLUID, FILLED IT, CHECKED AND FOUND FLUID SPRAYING OUT OF BOTH ENDS OF WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE \"RACK\" OR TUBE? IT TOOK LESS THAN A FEW \"SECONDS\" FOR IT TO DRAIN TOTALLY. I CHECKED THE INTERNET TO LEARN THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON. I DID A CLOSE PHYSICAL INSPECTION TO FIND MUCH CORROSION.

I HAVE SPOKE WITH TOYOTA DIRECTLY AND THEY REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE SITUATION. THERE SHOULD BE A LAW SUIT AGAINST TOYOTA FOR NOT REPLACING THESE REAR AXLES BECAUSE THE SAME METAL WAS OBVIOUSLY USED ON THE FRAME THAT WAS REPLACED. I HAVE NOW SEEN MANY OF THE SAME TRUCKS AROUND MY TOWN WITH THE SAME PROBLEM AND HAVE READ MANY COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET ABOUT THIS RECURRING SITUATION. IT IS IN TOYOTA'S BEST INTEREST TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM BEFORE THERE IS A CLASS ACTION AGAINST THEM.  *TR",

I FEEL THAT DUE TO THE NATURE OF THESE DEFECTS THAT THE VEHICLE IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND I'M GUESSING THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SELL AND IF I DID, IT WOULD BE AT A GREATLY REDUCED VALUE.      I PURCHASED A TOYOTA TRUCK BECAUSE OF THEIR REPUTATION FOR BUILDING LONG LASTING, HIGH QUALITY VEHICLES. I FEEL THAT IN LIGHT OF THESE DEFECTS THAT THEY MISREPRESENTED THEIR PRODUCT. *TR",

AT 35,000 MILES, I BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE A BRAKE PROBLEM WITH VIOLENT SHAKING OF THE FRONT END.  MY NORMAL MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT IT WAS WARPED FRONT BREAK ROTORS AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE GROUND DOWN FLAT.  I DID THIS AND THEN EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM AT APPROXIMATELY 45,000, 55,000 AND 65,000 MILES.  I AM NOW NEARING 75,000 MILES AND THE VIBRATION IS STARTING.  I ONLY DRIVE ABOUT 10,000 MILES A YEAR AND HAVE HAD HEAVY LOADS ON THE TRUCK ABOUT 5 TIMES IN THE LAST 8 YEARS.      MY MECHANIC SHOWED ME  A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS THAT MECHANICS HAD FOR UPGRADING TOYOTA TUNDRA BREAKS BECAUSE OF A DESIGN PROBLEM WITH UNDERSIZED FRONT DISC BRAKES AND DRUM BRAKES IN THE BACK AFTER MY LAST BRAKE JOB.  I CONTACTED MY TOYOTA DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT BRAKES ARE GENERALLY COVERED AND ARE CONSIDERED ROUTINE MAINTENANCE.  HOWEVER, THEY WERE AWARE THAT THE BRAKES ON THE 2002 -2003 TUNDRAS HAD A DESIGN PROBLEM AND DID  NOT HOLD UP PROPERLY.  THEY CONTINUED THAT THE BRAKES HAD BEEN UPGRADED WITH A LABOR ONLY CHARGE FOR ANYONE WHO CONTACTED THEM WITHIN THE FIRST 3 YEARS OR 36,000 MILES.  THEY ALSO STATED THAT THIS BRAKE UPGRADE KIT WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE AS A KIT AND I WOULD HAVE TO PURCHASE THE PARTS SEPARATELY IF I WANTED TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  THE COST OF THE PARTS IS OVER $2000 WITHOUT LABOR.  THE TOYOTA 800 NUMBER TOLD ME I HAD NO OPTIONS BECAUSE BRAKES ARE ROUTINE MAINTENANCE, PERIOD.  CURRENTLY, MY ONLY PLAN IS TO CONTINUE TO HAVE MY ROTORS TURNED EVERY 10,000 MILES UNTIL I NEED NEW ONES.  HOPEFULLY OTHER TUNDRA OWNERS WILL DO THE SAME OR THEIR SAFETY WILL BE GREATLY COMPROMISED.

THIS TRIP HOWEVER, I HIT A 'BUMP' ON RT. 93 SOUTHBOUND (HEAVY TRAFFIC) IN MEDFORD, MA AND THE SPARE TIRE BROKE OFF OF THE HOLDER. IT PROCEEDED TO BOUNCE UP INTO THE FRONT COMPARTMENT OF THE TRAILER AND THEN DROPPED DOWN AND LODGED BETWEEN THE TRAILER'S AXLES. AT LEAST NO ONE WAS INJURED, BUT THE VEHICLES WERE DAMAGED.   I HAD ABOUT $5,000 IN REPAIR BILLS RELATING TO THE 'ACCIDENT'. MY CONCERN IS THAT THE SPARE TIRE/WHEEL HAD NEVER BEEN OFF OF THE TUNDRA AND THEY WERE 'NEW' EXCEPT FOR THEIR AGE. IT APPEARS THAT THE AMOUNT OF RUST ON THE TIRE HANGER BRACKET WAS A MAJOR CAUSE OF THE WHEEL DROPPING. I HAVE PICTURES AND THE REPLACED PARTS FOR YOUR INSPECTION IF DESIRED; YOU CAN SEE RUST-OUT HOLES RIGHT THROUGH THE BRACKET! I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS COULD BE HAPPENING TO MANY OTHER TUNDRA'S OF A SIMILAR AGE.  I WOULD LIKE TO AT LEAST OFFER SOME FORM OF WARNING TO OTHER OWNERS.     AFTER TOYOTA'S EMAIL RESPONSE, BASICALLY SAYING THIS WAS NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE AND CALLING THE HOLDER BRACKET A 'COVER', I SENT A SECOND EMAIL:      MY CONCERN NOW IS THAT YOU HAVE REFERRED TO THE RUSTED-OUT BRACKET THAT HOLDS THE TIRE UNDER THE TRUCK'S BED (PART # 51900-0C010 ON MY REPAIR INVOICE.) AS A 'COVER, I'M HOPING THAT WE ARE SPEAKING OF THE SAME PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. MY SUGGESTION INVOLVES SAFETY MORE THAN WARRANTY OR MONEY. IF OTHER TUNDRA'S HAVE THE SAME ROTTING OUT OF THAT BRACKET, OTHER TIRES WILL FALL OFF OF THOSE TRUCKS.   BY THE WAY, MY TUNDRA LOOKS LIKE NEW AND IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION; SO I'M PRESUMING THAT OTHERS MAY BE EVEN WORSE AND THAT MY VEHICLE IS LIKELY IN AVERAGE OR BETTER CONDITION.  IF THIS TRULY IS A POTENTIAL ISSUE FOR OTHERS,   AT LEAST WARNING THEM TO EVALUATE IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE; I SURELY WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED IT! *TR   UPDATED 03/25/10 *BF  PICTURES RECEIVED.

AT ONE POINT I TOOK A TSB,(TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN) INTO THE SERVICE MANAGER AND SHOWED HIM THAT TOYOTA HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE FRONT BRAKE PADS,CALIPERS, AND ROTORS ON THE TUNDRA TRUCKS,(2000 THRU 2005).THE ORIGINAL FRONT BRAKE PADS,CALIPERS AND ROTORS WERE TOO SMALL FOR THIS SIZE TRUCK CAUSING THE BRAKES TO HEAT UP AND WARP THE ROTORS.  TOYOTA WAS TRYING TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM BY OFFERING AN UPDATED FRONT  BRAKE KIT, WHICH CONSISTED OF LARGER PADS AND CALIPERS.   I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE  MANAGER THAT MY TRUCK ALREADY HAD THIS UPDATED BRAKE KIT INSTALLED. THIS WAS ABSOLUTE LIE ON HIS PART BECAUSE AFTER REVIEWING THE TSB AND LOOKING AT THE PICTURES OF THE OLD STYLE PADS AND CALIPERS VERSES THE UPDATED PADS AND CALIPERS, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT MY TUNDRA HAD THE OLD STYLE AND TSB WAS DATED 9/12/02 AND MY TRUCK WAS TAKEN DELIVERY OF ON 2/01/02.   ON 7/7/08, I TOOK MY TUNDRA TO THE DEALER FOR INSPECTION AND WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT MY TRUCK NEEDED BRAKE PADS AND NEW ROTORS BECAUSE OF THE PULSATION CAUSED BY ROTORS. HE TOLD ME THAT TOYOTA HAD A PROBLEM WITH THESE BRAKES BECAUSE THEY WERE TO SMALL FOR THIS SIZE TRUCK. MY TOTAL BILL FOR THE PAD,ROTOR,AND INSPECTIONS CAME TO $498.84. WHEN I TOLD THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT THE BRAKE TSB ON MY TRUCK THEY SAID IT DID NOT QUALIFY FOR THE TSB AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO..   HAVE DOCUMENTED PROOF THAT INDEED MY TRUCK DID QUALIFY FOR THE TSB.   I CALLED TOYOTA CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE AND ALL I GOT FROM THEM WAS A LOT NEGATIVE ATTITUDE AND THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A DEALER PROBLEM. BASICALLY, THEY TOLD ME TO\"GO SCRATCH\".   THIS BRAKE PROBLEM IS GOING TO LEAD TO HEATED BRAKES THAT WILL NOT STOP THE TRUCK. *TR",

WHEN TAKING THIS PROBLEM TO A LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER, NO ONE SEEMED TO TAKE ANY ACTION.  3 MONTHS LATER, THEY STILL DIDN'T FIX MY CAR.      BRAKE HISTORY-SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE BRAKES AND ROTORS BEING WORN OUT AND WARPED FAST HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP THE LOCAL DEALER.  EVERY TIME A COMPLAINT WAS MADE, THE ANSWER WAS THAT BRAKE IS NOT COVERED BY THE 3-YEAR/36K WARRANTY.  WHEN THE STUDS BROKE OFF, DEALER TOLD ME THAT THEY DIDN'T DOCUMENT ANY OF MY COMPLAINTS DUE TO THE FACTS THAT I NEVER ASKED THEM TO REPAIR MY BRAKE.      WOW, IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAVE TO RIP ME OFF BEFORE THEY DOCUMENT MY COMPLAINTS. IF OTHERS GOT THEIR BRAKE SYSTEM UPGRADED FOR FREE OF CHARGE, THEN WHY NOT ME? *NM",

A SHORT TIME LATER THE LEFT FRONT OF MY VEHICLE VIOLENTLY FELL TO THE GROUND. THERE WERE VEHICLES BEHIND ME AND WITH DIFFICULTY I STEERED TO THE CURB. WHEN THE VEHICLE FELL TO THE GROUND, I HEARD A LOUD 'BANG', AND I FELT THAT I LOST SOME OF MY BRAKES. ONE OF THE DRIVERS BEHIND ME TOLD ME SHE SAW SPARKS COMING FROM UNDER MY VEHICLE. I LOOKED AT THE FRONT OF MY VEHICLE. I SAW THE LEFT FRONT TIRE, WHEEL & HUB (ALL STILL ATTACHED) FOLDED UNDER THE LEFT RUNNING BOARD PREVENTING THE FRONT FENDER AND BUMPER FROM FALLING DIRECTLY TO THE ROADWAY. I SAW THAT THE BRAKE LINES APPEARED TO BE BROKEN. I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO TOYOTA ON MON, JAN 22, 2007. I WAS TOLD THAT IT APPEARED THE LEFT UPPER BALL JOINT HAD BROKEN CAUSING THE WHEEL TO BREAK AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE. THE DEALERSHIP CONTACTED THEIR SERVICE DIRECTOR TO DETERMINE WHAT REPAIRS SHOULD BE MADE. I WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TOLD THAT MY VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THAT TOYOTA HAD 'NO LIABILITY' TO REPAIR MY VEHICLE AT THEIR EXPENSE. REPAIR ESTIMATE IS APPROX $5,000. + THE RENTAL VEHICLE THEY ARRANGED. I WAS TOLD A REGIONAL SERVICE INSPECTOR WOULD LOOK AT MY VEHICLE.

WE CHANGE TIRES ALL DAY WITH OUR AIR IMPACT WRENCHES AND WE ARE NOT BREAKING THEM.\"  A \"DIGITORQUE\" TORQUE WRENCH IS MUCH MORE ACCURATE THAN AN IMPACT WRENCH.  THAT IS WHY I OWN ONE BECAUSE I REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF SETTING NUTS AND LUGS AT THE RIGHT SETTING.
