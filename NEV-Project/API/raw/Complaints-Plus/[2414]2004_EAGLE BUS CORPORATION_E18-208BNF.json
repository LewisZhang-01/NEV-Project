I HAD 3 OTHER TIRES ON MY OLD BOAT TRAILER THAT WERE CARLISLE BLOW OUT.  I WAS TOLD BY SELLING DEALER THAT CARLISLE HAD CLEANED UP THEIR ACT AND THERE TIRES WERE SAFE. THIS TIRE IS 14 MONTHS OLD AND HAVE AROUND 2500 MILES ON THEM . I HAVE SEVERAL FRIENDS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM BUT WITH THE OLDER DESIGN CARLISLE. THE FACT IS CARLISLE TIRE IS STILL AN UNSAFE TIRE AND PUTTING HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN HARMS WAY, NOT TO MENTION THE COST OF THE DAMAGE DONE. THIS COMPANY NEEDS TO RECALL THERE UNSAFE PRODUCTS AND  BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THERE PRODUCT. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH 5 OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. THE ONE GENTLEMAN DAMAGE WAS SO BAD HIS TRAILER NEEDED REPLACED AND DID $3500. DAMAGE TO HIS BOAT.  ANOTHER PERSONS BLOWOUT  DID ABOUT $1800.00 DOLLAR IN DAMAGE TO HIS TRAILER. THESE TIRES  ARE UNSAFE AND  GOING TO EVENTUALLY LEAD TO A FATALITY IF IT HASN'T ALL READY.  8JB",
