The contact stated that as she arrived at her destination, she noticed a trail of gasoline. The vehicle was towed to the contact's residence and had not been driven since. The contact received a recall notification for NHTSA Campaign Number: 21V635000 (Fuel System, Gasoline) and scheduled an appointment with the dealer; however, the dealer informed the contact that the parts for the recall repair were not yet available. The contact stated that she contacted the dealer again to follow up on the recall repair, but the dealer informed her that there was no recall on the VIN. The contact stated that the manufacturer had exceeded a reasonable amount of time for the recall repair. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 226,000. VIN tool showed no open recall.",
