Pressing down harder on the brakes ,it felt like stepping on a brick, with no braking taking place the car accelerated at a high rate. At this time the car crashed into the left side of the garage and continued into the cement porch taking out the fence, fill tube, and vent tube of the oil tank. At this time I push gear shift into N and turned off the engine. At this time there is damage done to house and car is now totaled with no injuries.

I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM NATIONAL AUTO SALES IN GLASSBORO, NJ.  HYUNDAI APPARENTLY DID NOT KNOW I AM THE OWNER OF THE CAR, AND I  NEVER RECEIVED ANY RECALL NOTICES FROM HYUNDAI.

I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A HYUNDAI DEALER SERVICE CENTER ON 1/18/10 WHERE THEY SUPPOSEDLY INSPECTED IT AND PERFORMED THE NECESSARY \"CORRECTIVE\" PROCEDURES ON THE REAR SUSPENSION (ACCORDING TO THE DEALER INVOICE, THEY INSPECTED AND APPLIED WAX TO THE TRAILING ARMS).
