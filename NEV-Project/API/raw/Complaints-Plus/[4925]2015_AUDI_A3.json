Audi fitted A3 models that have a diesel engine with an auxiliary electric cabin air heater.  This heater helps to warm the cabin and provide defrost capabilities on days when the temperature is below 7 degrees C.    This heater in our vehicle failed due to melting at the wiring harness connection lugs.  This melting caused an overheating condition to occur.  On cold days we would notice a terrible burning plastic, rubber smell coming from the air vents inside the cabin.  Once the car was warmed up and the electric heater was disabled by the cars ECU (computer) the smell gradually went away.  The process was repeated the next day, but the smell was worse.  We took the vehicle to Zimbrick European Audi in Madison, WI.  They found the electrical issue with the Auxiliary Electric Cabin Air heater.    In researching this issue we found there are MANY user reports of the same failure on Volkswagon Audi Group vehicles.  Audi issued a safety recall for the SAME problem on Audi A4, A5 and Q5 vehicles under Audi Safety Recall Code  : 80C5 with the NHTSA document number being: RCRIT-17V622-6265.pdf  This very same problem currently affects my Audi A3 TDI.  I have found numerous other people reporting the same issue with VW Golf TDI models, VW Passat TDI models and Jetta TDI models.  Examples are located here:  https://forums.tdiclub.com/index.php?threads/burning-smell-from-heat.513304/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6tEwBzZIxs  The problem is most likely the same materials defects that occurred with the Audi A4, A5 and Q5 models.  The third party supplier of the Auxiliary Electric Cabin Air Heaters used TIN for some of the components. These substandard components lead to product failure and ultimately thermal overload, melting plastic/rubber and potentially a fire.",

THE PROBLEM OCCURS MOSTLY WHEN SOMEONE IS SITTING IN THE SEAT, BUT OCCASIONALLY IT WILL OCCUR WHEN THE PASSENGER SEAT IS UNOCCUPIED. THE YELLOW DASH LIGHT COMES ON NEAR THE PASSENGER AND THE AIRBAG LIGHT ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL ILLUMINATES. THE INFORMATION PANEL ON THE DASH WILL SIMULTANEOUSLY REPORT \"SAFETY SYSTEM: SYSTEM FAULT! SEE OWNER'S MANUAL\" AND \"PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF\" AND \"AUDI PRE SENSE: SYSTEM FAULT!\".      THIS FAULT OCCURRED APPROXIMATELY 8-10 TIMES DURING A 1,000 MILE TRIP MY WIFE AND I TOOK DURING MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND IN 2020. I HAD MY WIFE TRY ADJUSTING THE ANGLE OF THE SEAT, RAISING THE FRONT PORTION HIGHER TO TRY TO APPLY MORE BODY WEIGHT TO THE SEAT. MY THINKING WAS THAT IT WAS A SENSOR ISSUE. THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO SHUT OFF IF A PASSENGER DOES NOT WEIGH ENOUGH FOR THE AIRBAG TO SAFELY DEPLOY. THE SYSTEM FAULT ACTS LIKE IT DETECTS SOME WEIGHT THERE, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO ENGAGE THE AIRBAG SAFELY. MY BEST GUESS IS THAT THE WEIGHT SENSOR IS NOT REGISTERING THE WEIGHT CORRECTLY OR MAINTAINING A CONSISTENT READING THAT WOULD KEEP THE AIRBAG ENGAGED OVER TIME. THE PICTURE ATTACHED TO THIS REPORT WERE TAKEN ON MAY 25, 2020 DURING OUR TRIP, BUT THIS HAPPENS ON A REGULAR BASIS.     AFTER GETTING ONLINE TO GOOGLE FOR ANSWERS, I CAN SEE THAT MANY OTHERS ARE DESCRIBING THE SAME PROBLEM I AM EXPERIENCING. I SEE THAT THE 2015 MODEL MAY HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF A RECALL TO FIX THIS ISSUE AND I WOULD LIKE TO ADD MY INPUT TO ALL OTHERS THAT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD BE RECONSIDERED FOR MODEL YEAR 2015 AUDI A3 SEDANS (AND POSSIBLY OTHER AUDI MODELS).  *TR",

THE REPRESENTATIVE AT AUDI USA INSISTED THAT I SHOULD GO TO AN AUTHORIZED AUDI DEALERSHIP TO GET THE WORK DONE SO THIS WHEN IT IS COMPLETED, I AM TO SEND HER A COPY OF THE INVOICE AND WORK ORDER TO BE REVIEWED BY HER SUPERVISOR FOR POSSIBLE REIMBURSEMENT.
