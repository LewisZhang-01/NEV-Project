AGAIN, I HAD THE MOTOR REPLACED, BUT IT STILL WON'T GO DOWN WITHOUT HESITATION AND STOPS AT THE HALFWAY POINT.     THE ENGINE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON PERMANENTLY APPROXIMATELY 7 YEARS AGO AND I'VE HAD 3 REPAIR SHOPS TELL ME THEY CANNOT GET IT TO TURN OFF.  NOW I DON'T KNOW WHEN I'M HAVING AN ISSUE.

THOMAS VI) INFORMED ME THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS, AND QUOTED 4 PARTS COSTING OVER $1,411.62, AND THEY COULDN'T GUARANTEE ME THAT THESE REPLACEMENTS WOULD WORK. SO THEY DISCONNECTED THE SEAT BELT MOTOR (UNDER THE PASSENGER SEAT), MANUALLY MOVED THE SEAT BELT INTO THE DRIVING POSITION, AND ALSO DISCONNECTED SOME OTHER SEAT BELT ELECTRONIC PART BEHIND THE DRIVER SEAT NEAR THE HANDLE AND STORAGE COMPARTMENT OF THE BACK SEAT, BEHIND A SORT OF PANEL IN THAT AREA. OVER TWO YEARS LATER IN 2008, THE DRIVER SIDE LAP BELT RELEASE BUTTON BROKE AND FELL INSIDE THE SEAT BELT CLIP PREVENTING ME FROM LOCKING THE SEAT BELT IN PLACE. I STARTED RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM ON LINE AND FOUND THERE WAS A VOLUNTARY HONDA RECALL FOR THAT PROBLEM. I HAD TO FIGHT WITH THE DEALER TO GET THEM TO ADMIT THAT THIS WAS A PROBLEM THEY SHOULD FIX, AND THEY DID; BUT FORCEFULLY STATED THAT THE AUTOMATIC SEATBELT PROBLEM WAS NOT COVERED. IN LOOKING IN THEIR COMPUTER SYSTEM, I REALIZED THAT THEY HAD MISREPRESENTED THAT \"I CHOSE NOT TO FIX THE AUTOMATIC SEAT BELT PROBLEM\" IN 2005. I REFUTED THE ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENT. I WAS BILLED $26.38 AND RECEIVED NO SPECIFIC DIAGNOSIS SO I DEMANDED A QUOTE TO FIX IT.  THAT'S WHEN I WAS TOLD IT WOULD COST OVER $630 FOR THE PART AND $50 OR $75 FOR THE LABOR.  I HAD TO INSIST THAT THEY GIVE ME AN ESTIMATE WITH THE PART NO. IN CHECKING WITH ANOTHER DEALER, I WAS ABLE TO BUY THE PART FOR $362 (INCL. S/H).  I PAID THE LABOR TO DEALER TO HAVE IT PUT IN, AND THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED. ABOUT APRIL 2009, I STARTED GETTING OCCASIONAL BEEPS AND STICKING OF THE SEATBELT AGAIN, BUT IT WOULD RESET ITSELF.

THIS IS THE ONLY CASE OF A DOOR LATCH JUST FAILING IN ANY VEHICLE THAT I OR ANY OF MY FAMILY/FRIENDS HAVE EVER OWNED.  THIS COST OVER $700 TO REPAIR (SINCE THE DOOR WAS JAMMED SHUT)AND ALTHOUGH HONDA HAS UNOFFICIAL DOCUMENTS ABOUT THE DRILLING (FROM THE INSIDE) PROCEDURE TO RELEASE THE JAMMED LATCH, THEY HAVE NO OFFICIAL DOCUMENT RELATING TO THIS.  WHEN I CONTACTED THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP, AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE REGIONAL SERVICE MANAGER, I WAS BASICALLY TOLD \"SORRY, YOUR CAR IS PAST THE WARRANTY\" - END OF STORY. FROM THE REPORTS I HAVE SEEN ON THIS WEB SITE AND IN TALKING WITH A LOCAL HONDA MECHANIC, IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS FAILURES OF THIS TYPE.  THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE ORIGINAL DOOR LATCH DESIGN IS DEFECTIVE, SINCE I HAVE NEVER OWNED ANY CAR (OF ANY AGE) OR EVEN HEARD OF A CAR (BESIDES THE ACCORD REPORTS I GOT FROM THIS WEB SITE AND THE LOCAL HONDA MECHANIC) WHERE THE DOOR LATCH JUST FAILED.  I BELIEVE THAT THIS REPRESENTS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD, SINCE IF THE LATCH MECHANISM IS PRONE TO FAILURE WITHOUT ANY OUTSIDE INFLUENCE, THEN THAT MECHANISM WILL BE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO FAIL IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH, JAMMING THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR SHUT AND PREVENTING EASY EXIT FROM THE VEHICLE.  I BELIEVE THAT THE HONDA CORPORATION SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO CORRECT THIS DEFICIENCY BY REPLACING THE FAULTY DOOR LATCH MECHANISMS, OR AT LEAST OFFERING TO COMPENSATE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HAD TO SPEND WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE AN INORDINATE SUM OF MONEY TO REPAIR A MANUFACTURING DEFECT.  IT HAS TAKEN ME NEARLY A YEAR TO GET AROUND TO WRITING THIS, AND I WOULD BE WILLING TO BET THAT FOR EACH PERSON WHO FILES A COMPLAINT WITH THE NHTSA THERE ARE HUNDREDS MORE WHO DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR AGENCY OR DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO FILE A REPORT.
