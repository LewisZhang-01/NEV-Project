I CHECKED THE VEHICLE AND OBSERVED THAT THERE WAS SMOKE COMING FROM UNDER THE BRAKE FLUID RESERVOIR/CYLINDER AREA OF THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT/DRIVER'S SIDE. NO VISIBLE FIRE WAS DETECTED AT THIS TIME, BUT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME SORT OF COMBUSTION THAT HAD OCCURRED DUE TO THE VOLUME OF SMOKE. (NOTE - ALL COOLANT HOSES WERE CHECKED AND NO DEFECTS WERE OBSERVED WHICH WOULD CREATE THE APPEARANCE OF SMOKE THROUGH STEAM) I CHECKED THE FUSE BOX AND NOTICED THAT THE FUSE ALLOWING POWER TO THE BRAKE ACTIVATION/DEACTIVATION SWITCHES WAS BLOWN. I REPLACED THE FUSE AND THE VEHICLE STARTED TO SMOKE IN A THICK WHITE CLOUD FROM THE SAME AREA AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE NEXT DAY I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER. THE DEALER'S EXAMINATION REVEALED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS THE SPEED DEACTIVATION SWITCH, WHICH THE DEALER LABELS AS A \"KIT - BRAKE SWITCH\". RICK COLLINS, THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME HE WAS UNAWARE OF ANY PROBLEMS WITH FORD VEHICLES, MINE IN PARTICULAR THAT MAY BE CATCHING ON FIRE AS A RESULT OF THIS SWITCH. I CONDUCTED FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET WHICH LED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS OR MAY BE A PROBLEM THAT COULD CAUSE DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY TO SOMEONE. MY VEHICLE WAS UNATTENDED AND TURNED OFF WHEN THE SMOKE BEGAN AND THIS COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN A MORE SERIOUS SITUATION. FURTHER IT APPEARS THAT FORD DOES NOT PROPERLY INFORM THEIR EMPLOYEES OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH VEHICLES AND THEN ATTEMPTS TO COVER IT UP BY MISLABELING THE REPAIR BY NOT CORRECTLY IDENTIFYING THE REPAIR PARTS.
