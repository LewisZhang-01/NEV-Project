THE CAR WAS BUILT THE END OF MAY, 2010, AND BY JUNE, 2014, WITH APPROXIMATELY 54,000 MILES, ONE RIM WAS SO BADLY CORRODED IT WOULD NO LONGER HOLD AIR.  ONE OTHER RIM WAS ALSO CORRODING BADLY, BUT WAS STILL HOLDING AIR BEFORE I REPLACED IT.  THE OTHER TWO RIMS HAD SOME CORROSION, BUT TO A MUCH LESSER EXTENT THAN THE OTHERS.  THE LOW TIRE PRESSURE WARNING SENSOR HAD STOPPED WORKING ON THE TIRE THAT WAS LOSING PRESSURE, BUT IS WORKING SATISFACTORILY ON THE NEW RIM.  IN MY OPINION, CADILLAC SHOULD BE FORCED TO RECALL ANY OF THESE RIMS THAT HAVE CORRODED--TRUE, MICHIGAN USES SALT ON ITS ROAD DURING THE WINTER,  BUT THIS IS SOMETHING CADILLAC CERTAINLY KNEW ABOUT AND THAT IT SELLS A LARGER NUMBER OF CARS IN MICHIGAN.  FURTHER, THE LIST PRICE FOR REPLACEMENT RIMS FROM CADILLAC IS APPROXIMATELY $900.00 PER RIM--$3600.00 FOR ALL FOUR!  I COULD LIVE WITH THE CORROSION IN TERMS OF APPEARANCE, BUT A RIM THAT WILL NOT HOLD AIR IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY HAZARD, AND IT OCCURRED FAIRLY EARLY ON IN THE VEHICLE'S OPERATIONAL LIFE.    (2) MY 2010 CADILLAC DTS HAD THE BULB ON ITS UPPER DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT TURN SIGNAL BURN OUT AFTER FOUR YEARS AND 54,000 MILES.  IT TURNED OUT IT IS A TWO-PERSON JOB TO REPLACE THE BULB (WHICH IS A MUNDANE, TRADITIONAL INCANDESCENT BULB, NOT A LED) AND A LABOR COST OF MORE THAN $200.00.  THE REPLACEMENT IS NOT SOMETHING EVEN A FAIR-TO-MIDDLING SHADE TREE MECHANIC CAN UNDERTAKEN--IT REALLY REQUIRES A DEALERSHIP.  I AM AFRAID THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE, WHEN THEY FIND OUT THE COST OF REPLACING THE BULB, WILL SIMPLY SAY TO HELL WITH IT.  THE SAFETY HAZARDS CAUSED BY THAT IS INTUITIVELY OBVIOUS TO EVEN THE MOST CASUAL OBSERVER.

POSITIONED TOO CLOSE TO MY HEAD WHEN I SIT UP STRAIGHT, THE HEAD RESTRAINT CAUSES MY HEAD TO POINT TOWARD MY LAP .  IF I POSITION THE SEATS BACK SO THAT I CAN LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD WITH MY HEAD ERECT, THE SEAT BACK DOES NOT TOUCH MY SHOULDERS AND UPPER BACK AND I HAVE TO HOLD TIGHTLY TO THE STEERING WHEEL TO STEADY MYSELF TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE CAR, WHICH IS BOTH DISTRACTING AND VERY TIRING.  I AM 5'9\", 133 #, SLIGHTLY BUILT IN THE SHOULDERS.  MY HUSBAND HAS MORE SHOULDERS AND HAS NO PROBLEM.  OUR 2006 CADILLAC DTS HAD ADJUSTABLE HEADRESTS, WHICH WE ADJUSTED EACH TIME WE USED ONE OF THE FRONT SEATS.  IN THE 2010 DTS, I HAVE PUT THE SEAT BACK A FEW INCHES AND SUPPLEMENTED WITH A SMALL PILLOW TO SUPPORT MY UPPER BACK, BUT HAVING TO ADJUST THE PILLOW FREQUENTLY AFTER I TURN TO LOOK TO THE SIDE OR BEHIND, DISTRACTS FROM MY DRIVING.  WE RENTED BOTH A 2009 HONDA ACCORD AND A 2010 FORD FUSION AND I HAD EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THOSE VEHICLES.  OUR DAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND RECENTLY BOUGHT A 2010 CHEVROLET TRAVERSE; SHE IS 5'4\" AND SLIGHT AND HAS THE VERY SAME PROBLEM WITH THE HEAD RESTRAINTS AS I DO.  THEREFORE, HEIGHT IS NOT THE ISSUE; HAVING A THINNER FRAME THAN THE DOT \"TEST DUMMIES\" USED TO DETERMINE THE DISTANCE IS THE PROBLEM.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE WHICH CANNOT BE ADDRESSED IN A CASUAL MANNER BY THE USER.  THE DOT MUST ADDRESS THIS BEFORE SERIOUS ACCIDENTS OCCUR.",
