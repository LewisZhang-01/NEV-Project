        "summary": "The fuel strip located inside the tank which sends an electronic signal to the dash gauge indicating the amount of fuel available until the low fuel warning light comes on malfunctions and eventually fails. The vehicle is available for inspection upon request. On three separate occasions (two on 55 mph + roads with two + lanes of traffic and once on a local 35 mph one lane road) I was driving and the fuel level indicated a sufficient amount to travel to my destination when the tank abruptly ran dry with no warning and I had to coast to the side of the road stranded and had to call for roadside assistance. The problem occurred within two to three years of the vehicle being in service. The factory warranty covers 3 years/3600 miles. To the best of my knowledge, the problem first occurred in 2011 or 2012. I am not sure if the first occurrence was covered under the original manufacturers factory warranty but I would not pay out of pocket cost to have the fuel strip replaced. After many complaints and incidences from other owners the manufacturer notified owners by mail that the fuel strip warranty was extended to 12 years from original date of sale. By extending the warranty terms I would hope that the manufacturer planned to give its engineers time to come up with a permanent fix for this ongoing problem, but chose to only keep replacing the defective part with another sure to fail part continuing in a cycle of frustration and endangering rider safety. My vehicle is now in the 13th year of service and is no longer covered by the extended warranty. I voiced my concerns to the BMW Customer Service representatives and they acknowledge the warranty has now expired with no permanent fix or resolve to the original problem. This malfunction has been well documented at BMW motorcycle dealers both in the US and worldwide. My concerns have fallen on deaf ears. Check the service records at any BMW motorcycle dealer and you will find many replaced fuel strips under the  warranty.",
