        "summary": "When trying to accelerate after braking the vehicle has a MASSIVE hesitation where it just sits there doing nothing literally for a solid second. Not only being very frustrating it's IMO very dangerous. If I'm at a yield and then need to merge quickly, if I'm getting on a highway from a parking lot, if I'm trying to switch lanes in traffic, etc etc the vehicle just bogs down and does nothing for that 1-2 seconds.  Drive the vehicle normally, apply the brakes and then right away take your foot off the brake and accelerate. You don't have to mash the accelerator, even with light to moderate pressure you will notice that lag where the vehicle is just sitting there with zero power. If you do accelerate moderately or hard after a second or 2 of doing nothing it will just completely jerk into motion. Does the same thing in all modes, it's actually worse in Sport and Sport+ mode because you get more power after the hesitation  After braking moderately hard from 40mph to 15mph because someone cut in front. Then I changed lanes and had to accelerate because that other lane was going quite a bit faster. Hit the gas and nothing for what seemed like the longest 1.5 seconds until the thrust came back online  Pattern:   From Stop --> Accelerate  for about approx 20 MPH -->Release the gas pedal and immediately apply the gas pedal.  Another pattern:  Travel in about 40 MPH, apply the brakes to a speed below 20 MPH and apply gas pedal.  Consulted with the dealer  multiple times and they think this is normal for 2018 MDXes. But it is indeed a safety concern. The dealer said they applied TSB 20-015 TCM update and it still has not resolved the problem.   THIS IS A HUGE SECURTY ISSUE and DANGER HAZZARD.  The issue happens every day.  Below reported date is the latest occurrence.",

Also left message with general manager and no return call. They don\u2019t care. They only appear interested when you are buying the vehicle. I did file a claim with Acura corporate office and still no word from them either. I have read many cases about the MDX going up in flames for no reason, even in the driveway or drive in your neighborhood. Not sure why they have not recalled this or tried to solve the issue.

THAT POSITION IS IN THE HIGHEST POSITION THE STEERING WHEEL CAN BE PLACED IN.      WE HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE AT BAKERSFIELD ACURA FOUR SEPARATE TIMES TO CORRECT THE ISSUE.  BAKERSFIELD ACURA HAS BEEN UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE ISSUE WHILE THE VEHICLE IS AT THEIR FACILITY.  THEIR SERVICE WRITER, OMAR, ACTUALLY WITNESSED THE MALFUNCTION WHEN I DROPPED THE VEHICLE ON JULY 16, 2018.       I HAVE FILED A COMPLAINT WITH ACURA CLIENT RELATIONS, CASE NUMBER 08936387.  ACURA REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE ISSUE.  I HAVE EXPLAINED THAT THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL STAYS IN THE HIGHEST POSITION, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE OVER THE STEERING WHEEL, BLOCKING OUR VISION OF THE ROAD.  MY WIFE AND I JUST GET IN THE VEHICLE, START IT UP AND TAKE OFF.  NORMALLY, IT IS NOT UNTIL WE ARE DRIVING THAT WE NOTICE THE ISSUE.  AT THAT POINT, WE ARE FUMBLING AROUND TRYING TO LOCATE THE LEVER TO MANUALLY ADJUST THE STEERING WHEEL.  AT 65 MPH ON THE FREEWAY, THAT IS VERY DISTRACTING AND DANGEROUS.  A SPLIT SECOND OF DISTRACTED DRIVING CAN CAUSE A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT.      TIFFANY AT ACURA CLIENT RELATIONS, AND DAVID, THE SERVICE MANAGER AT BAKERSFIELD ACURA HAVE BOTH ADMITTED THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, BUT CONTEND IT ONLY HAPPENS WHEN BOTH DRIVER ONE AND DRIVER TWO KEYS ARE PRESENT.
