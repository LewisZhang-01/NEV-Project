THIS FAILURE CIRCULATED METAL PARTICLES THROUGH THE VEHICLE FUEL SYSTEM.  THEY ARE STILL REVIEWING WITH THE AUDI, BUT DEALER SAID THAT THIS HAPPENED TO ANOTHER TDI NOT LONG AGO AND AUDI HAD THEM REPLACE THE ENTIRE FUEL SYSTEM FROM THE FUEL TANK TO THE INJECTORS.  VEHICLE IS STALL AT DEALER WAITING ON PARTS.  IF THIS HAD HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY IN TRAFFIC I DON'T BELIEVE I COULD HAVE COASTED TO THE SHOULDER AND WOULD HAVE BEEN STALLED IN TRAFFIC.  *TR",
