These are known issues, and the predominent complaints listed not only on replacement part websites on the internet, but in NHTSA's own website for this vehicle - even more then the recalled airbags, are all specifically for this exact same issue being suffered by numerous complainants, but for some reason NHTSA has failed to recognize and enforce a recall on it.  Acura/Honda has not even issued a service bulletin on it to allow its dealers to repair it, despite it being a known issue, and Honda Financial Services even deceitfully denies warranty claims, even lying about contract terms to avoid coverage.  This is a serious safety issue affecting scores of owners of this vehicle, including the 2013, 2014, and 2015 model years, as reflected on the internet and in complaints.  Owners may not even realize they are driving with a defective headlight until they get into or cause an accident.  This needs to be flagged as an urgent RECALL requirement.",

        "summary": "Q. Basic Introduction:  Like hundreds of people all over the internet, my 2014 Acura RDX base model's low-beam headlights deteriorated to the point of being of no use while driving.  Quite literally, without exaggeration, at night, I saw nothing but a faint glow on the street immediately in front of the car.    Q. What component or system failed or malfunctioned, and is it available for inspection upon request? The LOW BEAM headlights failed, becoming dim to the point of extreme danger.  I had to literally avoid driving anywhere at night.  And yes: I replaced the headlights with aftermarket replacements (not trusting the manufacturer), and I have the original headlights still in my possession.  Q. How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? I was fortunate to be in a househould with more than one car, where I was able to simply never drive the car at night, other than occasions where we were out later than expected, and had to get home with virtually no usable low-beams.   Other people who only had one car, who had no choice, and most commonly, people whose low-beams deteriorated so gradually that they didn't notice, are driving around all over America.  We are all at risk.  Q. Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? Many people in online communities have contacted dealers, but I personally did not, other than asking a service rep about it.  In my case, the person either didn't know, or pretended they didn't know about the problem.   Q. Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others? No.  By avoiding driving it, having other cars, and being careful, there was no accident in my situation.   Q. Were there any warning lamps, messages or other symptoms of the problem prior to the failure, and when did they first appear? None, other than finally realizing the low beam headlights were not of any use.  I noticed in Summer 2020, at approx. 62,000 miles.",

In multiple conversations with the dealer, there was some acknowledgement of the issue and the only solution is to replace the headlamp assembly for over $2000 which may not solve the issue. This problem has been reported online by many owners of the Acura 2013 -2015 RDXs and there have been no recalls for it.   See www.carproblemzoo.com and www. Carcomplaints for many complaints. It appears that the reflective coating in the headlamp deteriorates over time, causing the problem. See recall for the same problem in the 2013-2014 Acura ILX at https://hondanews.com/en-US/releases/statement-by-acura-regarding-headlight-recall-2014-2015-acura-rlx.   There should be an immediate recall for the 2014 RDX.

VEHICLES WILL FLASH THEIR LIGHTS AT ME THINKING I DO NOT HAVE MY LOW BEAMS ON BUT I DO THEY JUST SUCK. IN MY RESEARCH, IT APPEARS THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH A REFLECTIVE AREA INSIDE THE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY THAT AFFECTS THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE BULBS. I BELIEVE THIS HAS BEEN RECALLED ON A ANOTHER ACURA MODEL ABOUT THE SAME AGE. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY WHICH COST OVER A COUPLE THOUSAND EACH. THE GLASS COVER OVER THE FRONT OF THE HEADLIGHT IS ALSO FOGGED OR YELLOWED A BIT WITH AGE BUT NOT CONCERNING.  I HAVE NOTICED THIS PROBLEM SINCE SUMMER OF 2020 BUT NOW IT IS TO THE POINT THAT I DO NOT DRIVE MY CAR AT NIGHT AND HAVE TO BORROW FAMILY MEMBERS' VEHICLES DUE TO MY AND OTHERS SAFETY",

MY SON WAS IN THE VEHICLE WITH ME.  HE PULLED BACK THE SUNROOF COVER AND WE SAW THAT THE SUNROOF WAS SHATTERED.  AS I DROPPED MY SON OFF AT WORK, WE WERE ABLE TO FURTHER EXAMINE THE DAMAGE.  THE SHATTERED PIECES OF GLASS WAS BLOWING OFF THE ROOF AS I CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE MAKING IT A SAFETY CONCERN.  THEREFORE, I HAD TO GET THE SUNROOF REPAIRED IMMEDIATELY.  I CONTACTED THE ACURA DEALERSHIP FIRST FOR THE REPAIR AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY DIDN'T REPAIR SUNROOFS. AFTER SHOPPING AROUND FOR AN AFFORDABLE PRICE,  I TOOK IT TO A AUTO GLASS REPAIR SHOP AND THEY REPAIRED IT.  I FOUND MYSELF WITH AN UNEXPECTED OUT-OF- POCKET EXPENSIVE REPAIR COST OF A LITTLE LESS THAN $500.   I WAS LATER INFORMED OF AN CURRENT INVESTIGATION ON EXPLODING SUNROOFS.  I'M WONDERING IF THAT'S WHAT I EXPERIENCED WITH VEHICLE'S SUNROOF. I DO HAVE PHOTOS BUT NOT ABLE TO UPLOAD AT THIS TIME.",

FORTUNATELY THERE WERE NO CARS BEHIND ME AT THAT TIME AND THE LINER INSIDE MY CAR WAS CLOSED OR GLASS WOULD HAVE FLOWN INTO THE CAR AND MOST LIKELY HURT MYSELF AND MY CLIENT.   I CALLED ACURA DEALER, AND THEY SAID THEY NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING.  AFTER SEARCHING ON THE INTERNET, I FOUND THAT THIS IS A CHRONIC PROBLEM AND HUNDAI AND AUDI HAVE ISSUED VOLUNTARY RECALLS OF SUN ROOF GLASS AND THAT MANY OTHER CAR MANUFACTURERS HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM.  HERE IS A LINK TO A TV NEWS STORY ON THE ACURA RDX :  HTTP://WWW.NBCNEWYORK.COM/NEWS/LOCAL/SHATTERED-GLASS-SUNROOF--293692881.HTML.  THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AT THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION AND THERE ARE CLASS ACTION SUITS UNDERWAY.  I AM IN THE PROCESS OF ASKING ACURA TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR WHICH WILL BE ABOUT $1,200 ($367 FOR THE GLASS AND THE REST LABOR CHARGES).  WITH ALL OF THE SUN ROOFS OUT THERE, THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE FOR PEOPLE IN THE CAR AND OUTSIDE OF THE CAR WHEN THERE IS FLYING GLASS.  ACCORDING TO REPORTS, THINNING OF THE SUN ROOF GLASS AFTER 2010 COULD BE PARTLY RESPONSIBLE AS CAR MANUFACTURERS ATTEMPTED TO LIGHT WEIGHT FOR BETTER GAS MILEAGE.  ALSO, THE GLASS USED IS NOT THE SAME AS WINDSHIELD GLASS.  .  I AM HOPING THIS REPORT WILL MAKE OTHERS AWARE OF THIS SAFETY PROBLEM.",

IN TALKING WITH A ACURA MECHANIC HE MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT THEY HAD SOME ELECTRICAL ISSUES ON THESE VEHICLES BUT NOTHING WAS PROVEN. WE ARE WAITING ON THE RESULTS FROM THE ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS THAT THE INSURANCE PEOPLE HAVE HIRED TO TRY TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH IT'S MANUFACTURING  OR SOMETHING ELSE THEY ARE ASKING IF ANY THING WAS LEAKING FROM THE VEHICLE AND AS FAR AS WE KNOW IT WASN'T LEAKING SINCE WE KEPT DRIVING IT UNTIL WE TOOK IT TO THE BODY SHOP. MY PROBLEM IS I DON'T WANT TO PARK THE OTHER RDX IN MY GARAGE NOT KNOWING IF THE VEHICLE HAS A MANUFACTURING ELECTRICAL PROBLEM. THE MECHANIC TOLD ME TO DISCONNECT MY BATTERY CABLE IF I WAS WORRIED. I DON'T FINE THAT AS A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. THE OTHER PROBLEM WE HAVE IS THE CAR WAS BEING DRIVEN AND THEY PULL IT INTO THEIR SHOP WHERE THEY HAVE WORKED ON HONDA'S AND ACURA'S FOR A LOT OF YEARS AND THIS MODEL CATCHES ON FIRE. SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT. MY WIFE TOOK SOME PICTURES ON HER PHONE OF HER RDX.",

THIS MUST BE REPEATED FOR EVERY LETTER IN THE PLACE NAME, STREET NAME, STREET NUMBER AND CITY.  IT IS SO DISTRACTING TO BE INFINITELY MORE DANGEROUS THAN A TOUCH INTERFACE.    TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THE PRE-LOADED MAP IS INACCURATE. FOR INSTANCE, CALIFORNIA STATE HIGHWAY 1 IS NOT CATEGORIZED AS A MAJOR ROAD.

THE MANUFACTURER TO THIS POINT HAS HAD A VERY CAVALIER ATTITUDE THAT THE METAL ON METAL SITUATION JUST COMES WITH THE CAR. THE DEALER CONFIRMS,\"THE NOISE ISSUE IS SUBSTANTIAL\".
