I CALLED MY CAR INS AND GENERAL MOTORS ON 2/20, MY CAR INSURANCE WAS VERY HELPFUL, BUT GM, NOT!  AFTER TALKING TO 3 DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND NO ONE EVER CALLING ME BACK GM CASE NUMBER CASE FILE NUMBER - 71-604440275, FINALLY ON APRIL 29TH, I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOTHING GM COULD DO FOR ME.  THE FIRST EXCUSE WAS THAT MY INSURANCE WAS INVOLVED THEY WILL NOT BE HANDLING ANYTHING, AND THEN THEY SAID THAT THEY WILL NOT PAY FOR ANYTHING BECAUSE \"THERE WERE NO FLAMES\"  THEY DID OFFER ME A $2000 LOYALTY VOUCHER TO USE ON A NEW CAR TO BE USED IN 1 YEAR.  I AM PICKING UP THE CAR (IT HAS BEEN FIXED BY A GM DEALER) TOMORROW AND THE BURNED SEAT (TO KEEP) AND AM VERY UPSET THAT THEY WOULD NOT PAY FOR THE DAMAGE OF $638 (MY INSURANCE DEDUCTIBLE AND A PART (THE PART THAT CAUSED THE FIRE).  I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD BE OF ASSISTANCE TO ME.  I HAVE THE SEAT AT HOME.  *TR",

THE ALL WHEEL DRIVE ENGAGES ONLY AFTER A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF REAR TIRE SPIN FOLLOWED BY A LURCH AS THE FRONT TIRES KICK IN.  THE AWD LURCHES (ENGAGING AND DIS-ENGAGING MANY TIMES AS I TIRED TO GET UNDER WAY AT A STOP LIGHT).  THE VEHICLE WOULD EASILY FISH TAIL WITHOUT ANY ERRATIC OR PROVOKED ACTIONS BY THE DRIVER.  WHEN THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED I WAS TURNING RIGHT ONTO A 4 LANE DIVIDED MAIN STREET THAT WAS ICY/SNOW PACKED \u0013 I WAS TIP TOEING AROUND THE CORNER WHEN BACK TIRES SPUN WHICH ENGAGED THE AWD WITH A LURCH.  THIS CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO FISH TAIL TO THE LEFT, TO THE RIGHT AND BACK TO THE LEFT AS THE DRIVER TRIED TO SAVE THE VEHICLE FROM DISASTER.  I REACHED A TOP SPEED OF 17 MPH (BARELY ABOVE IDLE).  EACH TIME THE VEHICLE FISH TAILED IT WAS MADE WORSE BY THE AWD SYSTEM THAT LURCHED (AGAIN AND AGAIN) UPSETTING THE VEHICLE IN ITS ALREADY PRECARIOUS STATE.  THE VEHICLE SLOWED TO 6 MPH BEFORE IMPACT INTO A LIGHT POLE.I NOW HAVE MAJOR SAFETY CONCERNS ABOUT DRIVABILITY OF THIS VEHICLE IN SLIPPERY CONDITIONS.  GIVEN THE LURCHING AND TAIL HAPPY NATURE OF THIS AWD SYSTEM I WOULD RATHER NOT DRIVE THIS VEHICLE IN WINTER (SNOW/ICY) CONDITIONS (WHICH IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT I GOT THIS VEHICLE).    I ALSO FEEL THAT I CANNOT SELL OR TRADE THIS VEHICLE IN FOR FEAR THAT THE NEXT OWNERS WILL EXPERIENCE THE SAME LURCHING AND FISH TAILING CONDITIONS WITH THE AWD BUT HAVE MORE DAMAGING/DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES.

I WAS TOLD THE PROBLEM WAS IN THE ALL WHEEL DRIVE (ALL WHEEL DRIVE) TRANSFER CASE AND THAT OLDSMOBILE (GM) WAS ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT HAD NOT YET (AS OF 9/17).  IN 12/02 ALL WHEEL DRIVE WAS INOPERATIVE AND A FAULTY TRANSFER CASE SHIFT CONTROL MODULE WAS REPLACED ON 12/09/02 RESTORING ALL WHEEL DRIVE.  ON 12/18/02, THE TRANSFER CASE ENCODER MOTOR POSITION SENSOR WAS REPLACED.  CALIBRATION CHANGES WERE ALSO MADE TO INCREASE TO DELAY IN WHICH FRONT WHEEL ENGAGEMENT OCCURS AND TO DISENGAGE IMMEDIATELY.  PROBLEM:  THE CALIBRATION CHANGES HAVE LED TO A VERY UNSAFE CONDITION WHEN DRIVING IN WET AND SNOW CONDITIONS PARTICULARLY, DRIVING THE VEHICLE IN THESE CONDITIONS IS VERY TREACHEROUS AND RISKY BECAUSE SIGNIFICANT REAR WHEEL SPIN OCCURS (DUE TO THE INCREASED DELAY) UNTIL THE ALL WHEEL DRIVE ENGAGES WITH A LURCH.  IN SLOW TRAFFIC SITUATIONS THIS LEADS TO A SERIES OF CONVULSIVE, SPASMODIC LURCHES, WITH REAR END FISH TAILING, AS THE ALL WHEEL DRIVE ENGAGES AND DISENGAGES UNCONTROLLABLY.  AT MORE MODERATE SPEEDS, APPROXIMATELY 20 MPH, THE FISH TAILING BECOMES EXAGGERATED AND LEADS TO A SPIN OUT (FORTUNATELY, THERE WAS NO OTHER TRAFFIC).  I HAVE DRIVEN 4 WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLES FOR 15 YEARS, ALL WHEEL DRIVE FOR 6 YEARS AND HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THIS.  THIS IS TRULY THE MOST DANGEROUS VEHICLE I HAVE EVER DRIVEN IN SNOW, INCLUDING 2 WHEEL DRIVE.  IT CANNOT BE DRIVEN SAFELY IN EVEN THE LIGHTEST SNOW CONDITION.  WHAT IS THE POINT IN OWNING AN SUV IF IT CANNOT BE SAFELY DRIVEN UNDER CONDITIONS IN WHICH YOU NEED IT.  DEALER SERVICE, OLDSMOBILE CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND TECH SERVICE ADVISOR ALL SAY THE SYSTEM IS PERFORMING ACCORDING TO MANUFACTURER SPECIFICATIONS.  I FIND THAT STATEMENT TO BE OUTRAGEOUS.   *JB",

I CONTACTED THE GM ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE TOLL-FREE # TO NOTIFY THEM OF MY PROBLEM AND THEY SUPPLIED ME WITH A # TO REFER TO IN CASE A TOW VEHICLE DID NOT ARRIVE.  APPROXIMATELY, 30 MINUTES LATER A TOW TRUCK ARRIVED AND MY VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO YARK OLDSMOBILE.  I SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER- ANTHONY AND HE DOCUMENTED MY CONCERNS AND TOLD ME THAT MY CAR WOULD BE SERVICED AND THEY WOULD LET ME KNOW WHAT THE ISSUE WAS.  I ALSO TOLD HIM  THE OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE INCLUDED:  REAR SUSPENSION DEFECT 7/2001, LOSS OF BRAKES IN 8/2001, CAR FAILING TO START AND NEEDING TOWED OR JUMPED 3 TIMES SINCE 8/2001.

I THEN ON 7/31/01, PARKED MY CAR ON MY DRIVEWAY (INCLINE) AND THEN PLACED MY EMERGENCY BRAKE ON. A FEW HOURS LATER I CAME OUT, STARTED MY CAR, TOOK THE EMERGENCY BRAKE OFF, PUT MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND PUT THE VEHICLE INTO DRIVE.  AT THAT TIME I WENT TO PUT MY FOOT ON THE GAS AND MY CAR ROLLED BACKWARDS OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY, INTO THE STREET AND INTO MY NEIGHBOR'S DRIVEWAY. I PUT MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE BUT DID NOT STOP, I HAD TO PULL THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.  I ONCE AGAIN TRIED TO PUT THE CAR INTO DRIVE AND APPLY MY BRAKES, BUT WAS UNABLE TO.  I USED MY EMERGENCY BRAKE ONCE AGAIN.  I TOOK THE CAR INTO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND THEY HAVE HAD MY VEHICLE SINCE FRIDAY, 8/3/01.  THEY STATE THAT IT IS NO LONGER DOING THIS, HOWEVER THEY ARE AWAITING A CALL BACK FROM GM TO SEE IF THERE HAS BEEN ANY OTHER REPORTS OF THIS PROBLEM WITH THE 2002 BRAVADA.  I HAVE A MAJOR CONCERN THAT IN ONLY LESS THAN 8 WEEKS THAT I HAVE HAD THIS NEW CAR, I HAVE HAD 2 SAFETY ISSUES WITH IT.  THANKS!*AK",
