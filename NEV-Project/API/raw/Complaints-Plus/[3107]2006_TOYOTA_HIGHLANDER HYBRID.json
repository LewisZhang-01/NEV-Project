        "summary": "Brake Actuator Assembly is a known issue with several Toyota models including my Hylander Hybrid.  Toyota tried to address these actuator issues by extending the warranty coverage for the Brake Actuator Assembly on a limited basis, however; there is not an actual recall for this when there obviously should be.  Thousands of customers are left with unknowingly driving vehicles that are not safe and for those that have had their brakes fail (and survive) are left with $3,000-$4,500 in repair bills to resolve these issues.  In April 2021, I noticed odd purging-like sounds while stopped at stop signs or red lights when the brakes were engaged.  This concerned me so, I had our local Toyota dealership check out our highlander but they said there was nothing wrong with the vehicle and we assumed they knew what they were talking about so we went about our business.  Unfortunately, some months later while driving hundreds of miles from our home, the Check VSC light, ABS, Brake, and one other dash warning lights came on and the purging sound became much louder.  Lucky for us, the brakes still worked enough to stop the vehicle.  An official recall would have facilitated our local Toyota Dealer Service Dept in alerting us about these issues before we were put in a dangerous situation.  Our Hylander is currently being worked on at our local Toyota Dealership.  A guy in the service department is how we found out about the Toyota Customer Support Program that outlines the brake actuator shortcomings/failures. The service dept. manager's exact words were \"it's like a recall but it's not an official recall\".  Here is a video I found on the Toyota Nation website where this gentleman's wife had her brakes fail and hit a car in a  parking lot.  Thank god she was not injured!  https://youtu.be/mn_xs6k8_H4  Ultimately, all Toyota models with these faulty brake components should be recalled!!",

He told me that it has something that may be caused by some electrical problem . He thinks that it has to do with a recall about some soldering electrical part in the inverter control. This has happened in 3 more occasion and I've been lucky and i have time to let it go to side of the road and i disconnect the ground wire for 5 minutes and connect it back and it resets and then starts to work normal.

Toyota replaced it, but there was still buzzing after the service, from a NEW part!? I strongly expressed this to Toyota since it still seemed like an issue to me, but they told me nothing could be done unless the computer said it was bad or if there was a recall. The buzzing continued to get worse and does it almost all the time now, and finally the ABS light came on, sometimes it will make an alert noise, and the vehicle will not brake properly (with the brake pedal feeling very firm), so apparently now that the ABS light is on, a diagnostic showed it bad again. I have researched to find many other people experiencing this same issue with this part going bad AND continuing to quickly go bad even after replacing, and I have been advised the danger of this, for if it goes out while driving, you cannot brake like normal and cause an accident. If a brand new part was making the same buzzing noise when the previous part did not used to make that noise, then something seems very wrong! And this is very much a safety issue if your brakes suddenly stop working like they are supposed to! Please help! I appreciate your time. Thank you!",

        "summary": "In the last 4 weeks my 06 Highlander Hybrid has had malfunctions in the brakes and in the power steering.  Both issues rendering the car inoperable.    The first issue that was to arise was the brake actuator pump.  I noticed it was failing when i got in the vehicle to move it out of the driveway and noticed after i put the car in gear that their was no power brake assist.  When the car was shifted into drive the car began rolling even while i was pushing hard on the brakes.  Luckily the brake assist resumed and i did not run into anything but the car unintentionally moved about 5 feet.  I mentioned this to my wife, and she said while driving home one day the car made a high pitched buzz.  She was close to home, so she made it home and parked the car and forgot about the noise.  After the car was turned back on again no noise was made and no CEL or warnings were displayed.  The actuator was replaced, and the car operated fine for about one week and probably 40 miles of driving.  I want to mention I had noted a odd feeling in the brakes for years leading up the the failure.  The brake pedal would continue to the floor while trying to maintain constant pressure on the brakes.  I believe this is due to the actuator losing pressure, but it would cause an uneasy sensation of failing brakes, but no CEL's were ever triggered.  The new actuator fixed this.  After fixing the car we drove it on a few trips.  Yesterday 8/24/21 my wife went to drive the car, and it wouldn't start.  She tried about 10 times and it wouldn't turn on.  I put a battery charger on the car and the battery looked okay.  I tried to start it a few time probably 5 and finally got the READY light, so the car was ready to go, but all of a sudden the car would shut off and the READY light would go out and the P/S light would come on.  This light is triggered when something is wrong with the power steering system, and the computer will disable the vehicle.  The car immobile now.  These are worth recalling.",

The car was in my parking lot for a few hours before which it had no signs on.  The warning message said: Vehicle Stability Control (VSC). I took it to my nearest Toyota service center for diagnosing the issue. They reported that the ABS systems have started to fail. Specifically, the ABS actuator is losing pressure and should be replaced. They quoted a price of $2700 approx. which includes about $2000 for parts. Turns out that this same part had been replaced in 2016 during a recall - but they cannot attend to this again without charging the customer. What I was never told about was that a whirring sound - which has always been an issue with this car - was always from the ABS actuator. The same service center has checked and diagnosed this car multiple times - so I am surprised that they did not find the ABS actuator noise a problem on earlier occasions. I have been reading about this on this forum and Toyotanation and this seems to be a consistent issue with the older Toyota hybrid highlanders and other hybrids as well - with the same diagnosis and approximately the same price quoted by the service centers. I have not currently fixed this issue since I cannot afford this price. It also seems that I will be paying for manufacturer's or service center's negligence since this actuator seemed to be faulty all along and  I was not warned about this.",

THEY MANIPULATED OWNERS BY HAVING A WARRENTY SUPPORT PROGRAM WITH END DATES, INSTEAD OF HAVING A RECALL ON IT. WHICH IS WHY WHEN I RESEARCHED BEFORE I BOUGHT, IS NOT LISTED ON CAR FAX. THE WARRANTY SUPPORT WAS BEFORE I PURCHASED VEHICLE AND PREVIOUSLY IT WAS EITHER IGNORED OR MISSED BETWEEN OWNERS. THEY HAVE HAD MANY OF THESE AND GET AWAY WITH IT. RIGHT NOW THERE IS A CLASS ACTION FILED IN OHIO OVER THIS SAME ISSUE WITH OTHER CARS. IT IS A $3000 DOLLAR PART AND NOT A KNOB ON RADIO. IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE DUE TO IT BEING PART OF THE BRAKING SYSTEM. I'VE SEEN WHERE THE SUPPORT PROGRAM SAID MILES DIDN'T MATTER BUT WHEN TALKING TO TOYOTA THEY SAY 114,000 MILES. THE CAR IS A 2006, YEAH THAT'S REASONABLE, EVEN FOR 2017/18 LETTER.  WHILE DRIVING THE VSC ALARM SYSTEM COMES ON AND THE BRAKING BECOMES DIFFICULT. THE PUMP HAS ALWAYS MADE A SOUND BUT WAS TOLD BY DEALER IT WAS THE SECURITY ALARM SYSTEM MAKING THE NOISE. IT HAPPENED IN 2019 ALSO, THE ALARM, BUT REPAIR SHOP SAID IT WAS CALIPERS, SO PAID $800 TO HAVE THEM REPLACED WITH PADS. ITS ALWAYS MADE NOISE BUT THE ALARM SYSTEM STARTED BACK UP AGAIN LAST MONTH. NOW WITH RESEARCH ON MY OWN, I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS BUT TOYOTA SAID THEY SENT LETTER TO PREVIOUS OWNER AND SORRY ABOUT MY LUCK! THIS HAS RENDERED THIS VEHICLE WORTH $5500, WORTHLESS. CANT TRADE IN A VEHICLE LIKE THIS AND LOST MY INCOME FROM DELIVERY WITH IT. I HAVE CHECKED OFF EVERYTHING THAT WOULD APPLY IF IT WAS A RECALL BUT SINCE THE SUPPORT PROGRAM HAS AN END DATE TO GET OUT OF TOYOTA EVER BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR DEFECTIVE PART, THEY PUSH IT OFF ON OWNERS. I'M JUST LUCKY, I HAVE A CDL AND GOOD DRIVER AND HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH IT.

NOTE, IN THE ORIGINAL RECALL, WHICH WAS 2010 FOR HIGHLANDER MANUFACTURED IN 2004-2006, WHICH IS AS LONG AS 6 YEARS LATER, TOYOTA MADE THIS RECALL AND STATED THAT THEY REIMBURSED THE REPAIR COST OF MASTER CYLINDER AND BRAKE BOOSTER IF DAMAGED. THERE WAS NO MILEAGE RESTRICTION. WITH TOYOTA'S RESPONSE, WHY EVEN BOTHER RECALL? THIS RAISED SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. IT'S VERY LIKELY TO CRASH WITH SUCH DAMAGE DUE TO THE SEAL LEAK.

ON THE MORNING OF SUNDAY (3/30/14) I WENT TO TURN ON MY CAR AND I NOTICE A P/S RED LIGHT CAME ON AND DID A QUICK SEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND REALIZED IT WAS MY POWER STEERING FAILING.  DID A QUICK TEST, CONFIRMED THAT MY STEERING WHEEL WAS DIFFICULT TO TURN. I DID SOME FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND REALIZE THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH HIGHLAND HYBRID AND THERE WAS ALREADY A NHTSA ACTION (PE06055) FILED PREVIOUSLY BUT HAD NO CONCLUSION.  I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS BROUGHT UP AGAIN, THAT IT HASN'T GONE AWAY, IT IS DANGEROUS AND I HAVE SEEN NUMEROUS WEB BLOG ABOUT THIS:    HTTP://WWW.GREENHYBRID.COM/DISCUSS/F12/2006-HCH-LOST-POWER-STEERING-BRIEFLY-25044/  HTTP://ANSWERS.EDMUNDS.COM/QUESTION-POWER-STEERING-FAILURE-ON-2006-HIGHLANDER-HYBRID-9455.ASPX    IT IS ABSURD THAT TOYOTA REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT A BAD QUALITY PRODUCT THEY PRODUCE.  IF THEY DON'T WANT TO RECALL, AT LEAST FIX THE ONE THAT ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE THE PROBLEM RATHER THEN HAVE PEOPLE SHELLING OUT THEIR MONEY (ON TOP OF WHAT THEY ALREADY PAID TO PURCHASE THE CAR) TO FIX A PROBLEM THAT TOYOTA CREATED IN THE OUTSET.  *TR",

WE HAD OUR LOCAL DEPENDABLE TOYOTA MECHANIC REBUILD THREADS FOR $2,700.A LOT OF MONEY  TO SPEND ON A TOYOTA WITH UNDER 70,000 MILES. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN TOYOTA'S RESPONSE. THEY NOT ONLY LOST MY FUTURE BUSINESS BUT ALSO MY DAUGHTER'S.   CAR WORKS FINE NOW. BUT I NO LONGER HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE VEHICLE. THAT LOSS OF FEELING OF DEPENDABILITY IS THE WORST PART.  *TR",

THOUGHT I HAD BLOWN A HEAD GASKET ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THE THREAD BOLTS ON THE SHORT BLOCK HAD STRIPPED OUT AND LEAKED RADIATOR FLUID EVERYWHERE CAUSING IT TO OVERHEAT.  AT THAT TIME THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED A NEW ENGINE.  CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME TOO BAD I BOUGHT A USED VEHICLE IF I WANTED TO TOW IT TO THEM THEY WOULD LOOK AT IT.  I THAN CONTACTED TOYOTA CORPORATION ONLY TO BE TOLD PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING, SINCE I WASN'T THE ORIGINAL OWNER THEY WEREN'T GOING TO HELP ME EITHER.  SO NOW I'M STUCK TRYING TO FIND AN ENGINE BECAUSE THE DEALERSHIP CAN ONLY OFFER ME ONE WITH 58000 MILES ON IT INSTALLED FOR ABOUT $7,000, AND FROM WHAT I'M READING ON THE INTERNET THEY HAVE THIS PROBLEM WHEN THE ENGINE REACHES RIGHT OUT OF THE WARRANTY AT 60,000 MILES.  I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT BOTH THE DEALERSHIP AND CORPORATION WON'T STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT AND FIX THE ENGINE OR AT LEAST OFFER SOME ASSISTANCE.  WHY SHOULD THEIR FAULTY ENGINE PART BE MY PROBLEM?  NOW OF COURSE BEING JUST A WORKING STIFF AND RETIRED MILITARY MONEY DOESN'T GROW ON TREES AND I DON'T HAVE ANOTHER VEHICLE, SO I HAVE TO GET IT FIXED.  I WON'T BUY ANOTHER TOYOTA AGAIN SINCE THEY DON'T STAND BEHIND THEIR OWN PRODUCT, BUT I'M STUCK WITH THIS ONE FOR NOW.  *TR",

THE VEHICLE STILL DISPLAYED SEVERAL WARNINGS AND AFTER SEARCHING FOR ALMOST 1 WEEK, THEY DETERMINED THAT THE POWER STEERING ESU WAS ALSO BAD ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT THE CASE PRIOR TO THE HYBRID FAILURE.  THEY SAID THAT THE 12 VOLT BATTERY ALSO NEEDED REPLACING ALTHOUGH IT WAS ONLY 8 MONTHS OLD AND WAS PURCHASED AT THE DEALERSHIP.  WHEN I ASKED HOW THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED, I WAS TOLD THAT THE VEHICLE MUST HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY LIGHTNING!  OCTOBER 1, 2011 IN OUR STATE WAS A BEAUTIFUL, CLEAR DAY AS IT HAD BEEN FOR A WHILE.

HYBRID COMPONENTS ARE COVERED UNDER THE EXTENDED HYBRID WARRANTY BUT THE STEERING ESU IS NOT AND WILL COST $1,000 TO REPLACE UNLESS TOYOTA WILL ACCEPT THAT THE FAILURE OF THE HYBRID COMPONENTS COULD HAVE CAUSED A POWERFUL ELECTRICAL SURGE THAT DAMAGED THE POWER STEERING ECU AS WELL AS THE 12 VOLT BATTERY.  *KB",

WE CALLED A TOW TRUCK & WAITED IN THE DARK ON SIDE OF INTERSTATE 65 TO WAIT FOR THEM TO PICK US UP.  IT TOOK ABOUT 45 MINUTES TO GET THE TOW TRUCK THERE AND FOR SOMEONE TO COME PICK US UP.  WE DEFINITELY FELT LUCKY TO GET OFF OF THE HIGHWAY WITHOUT GETTING HURT AS THIS AREA HAD NO LIGHTS AND WAS VERY DARK (EXCEPT FOR THE RED LIGHTS ON THE WIND MILLS ALL AROUND US).  WE WENT TO A HOTEL IN LAFAYETTE AND THE TOW TRUCK DROPPED THE CAR OFF AT THE DEALERSHIP.  THE NEXT MORNING, THE DEALERSHIP SENT A COURTESY CAR TO PICK ME UP & TAKE ME OVER THERE.  I SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD EVALUATE THE PROBLEM.  I TOLD HIM IT MIGHT BE THE INVERTER, AS MY FATHER OWNED A LEXUS RX400 HYBRID AND THE INVERTER ON HIS CAR FAILED AND LEXUS GAVE HIM THE PART.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TOLD ME THAT HE PERSONALLY HAD NEVER CHANGED AN INVERTER, SO HE DID NOT THINK IT WAS THAT.  I RENTED A CAR AND MY FAMILY AND I CONTINUED OUR TRIP TO FLORIDA.  A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER, THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP CALLED ME AND SAID THEY HAD TO TAKE THE ENGINE APART AND IT COULD BE AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR JUST TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG.  HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE RODENT DAMAGE.  DAYS LATER HE CALLED BACK AND SAID THAT IT WAS IN FACT THE INVERTER AND THAT THE REPAIR WOULD COST ME $9,600.00.

THE VEHICLE DASH TURNED ON WARNING LIGHTS WITH \"CHECK VSC HYBRID SYSTEM\"   THERE WAS NO PREVIOUS WARNING OF THIS PROBLEM, EVEN THOUGH I HAD TAKEN THE CAR TO REGULAR MAINTENANCE IN THE DEALER A MONTH OR TWO AGO. NO-ONE WAS HURT BUT THE COMPLETE SUDDEN LACK OF PROPULSION COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE LED TO SERIOUS ACCIDENT.    I WAS FORCED TO TOW THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND HAD TO GET A RENTAL CAR TO CONTINUE ON MY REGULAR DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES.  AFTER INVESTIGATION I WAS INFORMED THAT THE POWER INVERTER NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF OVER 7,000 FOR PARTS, PLUS EXTRA COSTS FOR LABOR. THIS SEEMS UNREASONABLY HIGH.  I RECOMMEND THIS IS INVESTIGATED AND TOYOTA BE ASKED TO:    1. INITIATE A RECALL FOR THIS PART.  THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS    PROBLEM. DON'T WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE IS INJURED OR DIES.       2. OFFER FREE REPLACEMENT OF THIS PART TO ALL TOYOTA OWNERS WHO HAVE    HAD THIS PROBLEM, INCLUDING PART, LABOR, TOWING AND ANY RENTAL CAR    COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOWN TIME CAUSED FOR THIS.      3. ISSUE REIMBURSEMENTS FOR ANY CUSTOMER WHO HAVE HAD TO SUFFER    THROUGH THIS PROBLEM AND PAID FOR IT FROM THEIR OWN MONEY.      4. EXTEND THE WARRANTY ON THE HYBRID RELATED PROBLEMS TO AT LEAST    150,000 MILES ACROSS ALL STATES - AS IT CURRENTLY IS BY LAW IN    CALIFORNIA.      5. OFFER A FREE AND COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF ALL HYBRID SYSTEMS    COMPONENTS FOR EVERYONE WITH A HIGHLANDER HYBRID THAT IS OVER OR NEAR    100,000 MILES, AND REPLACE ANY COMPONENTS THAT ARE CLOSE TO FAILURE.      6. TRAIN YOUR SERVICE PROFESSIONALS TO LOOK FOR POTENTIAL HYBRID    SYSTEM FAILURES AS PART OF ANY REGULAR MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE.

IF I NEED TO STOP REALLY FAST ON A BUMPY ROAD AND I HAVE A 1 OR 2 SECOND DELAY IN STOPPING I COULD END UP IN AN ACCIDENT.  *TR",

I BELIEVE THE LEATHER MATERIAL USED IN THE VEHICLE IS OF POOR QUALITY. ON 4/28/10 TOYOTA EVENTUALLY RESPONDED TO MY COMPLAINT, STATING THE WARRANTY FOR THE SEAT IS 3-YEARS OR 36,000 MILES: THEIR FILE # 1003280070; INCIDENT 100426-000166. THEY SUGGESTED I CONTACT A DEALER, WHICH I DID:ON 7/27/10 I HAD A TOYOTA DEALER LOOK AT THE SEAT AND THEY CONCLUDED THAT THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRE. I AM OBVIOUSLY NOT SATISFIED WITH TOYOTA'S RESPONSE; THEIR ESTIMATE FOR ME TO REPLACE THE SEAT CUSHION COVER IS $1123.36 INCL TAXES. I BELIEVE SUCH AN EXPENSIVE VEHICLE SHOULD BE OUTFITTED WITH A HIGHER GRADE LEATHER SEAT COVER. I HAVE HAD CHEAPER  VEHICLES WITH LEATHER SEATS WHICH LASTED MANY MORE YEARS THROUGH THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE. TOYOTA HAS DONE AN INJUSTICE WITH THE INSTALLATION OF THIS POOR QUALITY LEATHER AND I FEEL CHEATED BY SUCH ACTION. THERE MUST BE OTHER OWNERS WHO HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE THAT I HAVE WITH THE SEAT.

TOYOTA HAS NOT DONE A GOOD JOB TO ENSURE THE LASTING WEAR AND TEAR OF THE SEAT. IS THIS DELIBERATE? HOW DID THEY COME UP WITH A 3YEAR, 36000 WARRANTY? WHAT TESTING DID THEY PERFORM TO DECIDE THE SEAT WILL ONLY LAST UP TO THAT PERIOD, THEREFORE THEY WERE SURE TO MAKE A LOT OF MONIES ON REPLACEMENT AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRED? THIS IS UNFAIR.

I DISCUSSED THE ISSUE WITH HECKER TOYOTA AND SERVICE ADVISOR . I THOUGHT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE CVT TRANSMISSION AND SERVICE ADVISOR TEST DROVE THE VEHICLE WITH NO PROBLEMS DETECTED. SERVICE ADVISOR ALSO STATED THERE WERE NO TOYOTA SERVICE BULLETINS FOR ANY ISSUES LIKE THIS. I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THIS SITUATION APPROXIMATELY 10-11 TIMES SINCE NEW. THE PROBLEM DOES NOT SEEM TO BE TEMPERATURE RELATED. I DON'T RECALL ANY SURGES WHEN COLD (BELOW 20F OR COLDER) BECAUSE MN ROADS USUALLY HAVE SOME ICY OR SLIPPERY CONDITIONS AND I WOULD REMEMBER THIS SITUATION. *TR",

ALL THESE COMPLAINTS SAY SAME THING IN DIFFERENT WORDS. PROBLEM IS A VSC ALARM WHICH SETS OFF INDICATORS FOR SKID, ABS, AND OTHER SYSTEMS WITH THE ECU COMPUTER CAUSING AN AUDIBLE ALARM AND MESSAGE TO CHECK VSC SYSTEM. ALARM SEEMS TO PARTIALLY DISABLE BRAKING SYSTEM. BRAKES BECOME MUSHY AND I BELIEVE FRONT BRAKES ARE DISABLED. I KNOW REAR BRAKES STILL OPERATE MECHANICALLY, AND BECAUSE ABS IS DISABLED, REAR BRAKES CAN LOCK UP AND SKID IF BRAKE PEDAL IS PUSHED HARD ENOUGH. STANDARD RESPONSE FROM TOYOTA/LEXUS IS TO REPLACE ECU COMPUTER. HOWEVER, AS YOU CAN SEE FROM ABOVE COMPLAINTS, THIS DOES NOT ALWAYS SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  MY OWN COMPLAINT IS FOR MY 2006 TOYOTA HIGHLANDER HYBRID 4WD-I WITH APPROXIMATELY 54,000 MILES. I EXPERIENCED A ONE TIME VSC ALARM OVER 1 YEAR AGO WHEN THE ENGINE START BATTERY WAS DYING. TOYOTA DEALER TOLD ME TO REPLACE BATTERY AND SEE IF PROBLEM CONTINUED. I REPLACED BATTERY AND ALSO HAD ALL FOUR TIRES ROTATED. IMMEDIATELY AFTER I STARTED EXPERIENCING MORE VSC ALARMS AT A HIGHER RATE. THIS HAS OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING ON HIGHWAY AS WELL AS AT LOW SPEED. IT HAS ALSO OCCURRED BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT APPLYING THE BRAKE. 2 DIFFERENT TOYOTA DEALERS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO \"ADJUST\" SYSTEM TO STOP ALARMS WITHOUT SUCCESS. I HAVE GONE AS LONG AS 4 MONTHS WITHOUT AN ALARM AND THEN FOR NO REASON (NO SKID EVENT) ALARM RECURS. SOLUTION BOTH DEALERS HAVE NOW GIVEN IS TO REPLACE ECU. DUE TO FINANCES, I CAN NOT AFFORD NEW COMPUTER, SO I HAD A TOYOTA MECHANIC WITH 25 YEARS EXPERIENCE INSTALL TWO DIFFERENT USED COMPUTERS WITH NEITHER ONE SOLVING PROBLEM. AFTER EXAMINING THE INTERNET AND YOUR COMPLAINT BOARD I NOW REALIZE THAT THIS PROBLEM OCCURS ACROSS TOYOTA'S PRODUCT LINE AND THAT THERE IS NO CLEAR SOLUTION. I BELIEVE TOYOTA IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND IS NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THEY HAVE AN ECU COMPUTER PROBLEM. *TR",

HERE IS A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE WHICH OCCURRED CHRISTMAS EVE WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES PRIOR TO THE STOP SIGN AT THE END OF OUR STREET. I APPLIED THE BRAKES BUT THE CAR DID NOT STOP, INSTEAD IT \"THRUST ITSELF\", FOR LACK OF BETTER WORD, FURTHER FORWARD WHILE BREAKS WERE APPLIED, FORCING ME TO SLAM ON THE BRAKES TO AVOID BUSY CROSS STREET ONCOMING TRAFFIC. UPON SLAMMING THE BREAKS ALL THE WAY DOWN AND HOLDING, THE CAR REACTED CORRECTLY AND STOPPED. INCHES AWAY FROM A CAR TRAVELING AT 35 MPH OR MORE. OUR STREET ROAD WAS NOT WET NOR DID IT HAVE ICE: THE CAR MOTION WAS NOT ONE OF A SLIPPERY SLIDE. THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE WAS 40F. MY TEENS WERE IN THE CAR, AND THE PASSENGER SEATED TEEN OBSERVED THE SITUATION. SHE HAS SIMILARLY REPORTED THIS TENDENCY TO \"GO FORWARD\" WITH BRAKING RATHER THAN SLOW, AND THE NEED TO PRESS HARD. I WAS NATURALLY UPSET AT THIS NEAR MISS OCCURRENCE CHRISTMAS EVE.    I PERSONALLY HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN AT LEAST A HALF A DOZEN TIMES AS I CAN RECALL SINCE PURCHASE.

IN AUGUST OF 2008 WHILE BACKING OUT OF OUR DRIVEWAY I SUDDENLY LOST ALL POWER & CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE, THERE WAS NO BRAKE NOR STEERING. I WAS ABLE TO EVENTUALLY STOP THE VEHICLE BEFORE ANY PROPERTY DAMAGE WAS DONE. MY HUSBAND WRESTLED THE VEHICLE OFF THE ALLEYWAY & THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP. THEY SAID THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE \"ELECTRIC LINK ASSEMBLY\" & THEY SAID THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED. YESTERDAY MORNING AT 6AM I GOT INTO THE CAR & TURNED THE KEY, THE \"READY\" LIGHT CAME ON & I PUT MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE & PUT THE CAR INTO REVERSE, AS SOON AS I PUT THE CAR INTO GEAR, THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR, THE GAS ENGINE CAME ON FULL POWER & THE CAR FLEW BACKWARD. I TRIED FRANTICALLY TO DEPRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL TRYING TO STOP THE CAR & STEER THE CAR WHILE CAREENING IN REVERSE. THE CAR SLAMMED INTO OUR REAR NEIGHBORS VEHICLE (WHICH IS TO THE BACK & RIGHT OF OUR GARAGE ACROSS THE ALLEY) OUR CAR PUSHED THEIRS OVER 4-6 FEET & CONTINUED TRYING TO REVERSE FULL POWER OVER THEIR BUSHES I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO SO I SLAMMED THE CAR INTO THE \"PARK\" POSITION. THE CAR STOPPED BUT THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO RACE. I SHUT IT OFF & JUMPED OUT. I WAS NOT INJURED, HOWEVER OUR CAR & OUR NEIGHBORS WAS DAMAGED. THE CAR WAS AGAIN TOWED TO TOYOTA DEALERSHIP. I CONVEYED TO THEM WHAT HAPPENED & THE CAR IS THERE NOW GETTING CHECKED. I CALLED THEM IN THE EVENING TO ASK WHAT THEY HAD FOUND & THEY STATED THEY WERE TRYING TO \"REENACT\" WHAT HAPPENED. THEY MUST FIND WHAT IT IS IN THIS CARS COMPUTER THAT CONTINUES TO CAUSE THESE CATASTROPHIC MALFUNCTIONS. HAD I BEEN AT A SCHOOL OR SHOPPING LOT SOMEONE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. I AM A PERSON WHO BELIEVES IN ACCOUNTABILITY & OWNERSHIP OF RESPONSIBILITY & IF THIS WERE MY FAULT IN ANY WAY I WOULD NOT BE WRITING YOU TODAY. I FEEL YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM SO NO ONE IN THE FUTURE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED. *TR",

A SIGNAL WAS LIGHTED ON MY INSTRUMENT PANEL, AFTER READING THE OWNERS MANUAL, I FIND A PAGE WERE STATES THAT THE EPS SYSTEM CAN PROTECT ITSELF FROM OVERHEATING CAUSING THE LOSS OF POWER STEERING ASSIST. IN A HIGHLIGHTED SECTION OF THE OWNERS MANUAL, IT ASK THE OWNER TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO A TOYOTA SERVICE CENTER IF A EPS FAILURE HAPPENS. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AS RECOMMENDED BY THE OWNERS MANUAL. THEY ARE AWARE THAT THE EPS SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING BUT WERE UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. BY THE SIMILAR CASES FOUND IN THE INTERNET WITH THE SAME EPS ISSUE I CAN FORECAST THAT THE COST OF THE REPAIR WILL BE ANYWHERE FROM $2,000 TO $3,000 PLUS THE FACT THAT SPARE PARTS ARE ABOUT 20% HIGHER COST IN PUERTO RICO THAN THE REST OF THE US, IF THEY ARE AVAILABLE.I DO NOT AGREE THAT THIS ISSUE IS NOT A SAFETY PROBLEM. THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW AND QUALITY ISSUE THAT IS THE MANUFACTURERS (TOYOTA) RESPONSIBILITY. WHY DO I NEED TO PAY FOR A REPAIR THAT IS A MANUFACTURERS RESPONSIBILITY?  NEITHER THE DEALERSHIP OR THE TOYOTA DISTRIBUTOR ON PUERTO RICO HAS BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY OR PROVIDE SUPPORT TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OF THE EPS FAILURE.

THIS HESITATION THROWS OFF MY BALANCE AND TIMING CAUSING A SENSATION OF STALLING IN TRAFFIC AND BECOMING A SAFETY CONCERN FOR ME AND IS A PROBLEM.     TODAY I TOOK IT TO THE TOYOTA DEALER AND EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM AS THE VEHICLE IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.   THE SERVICE INVOICE STATES: \"CUSTOMER STATES THERE IS A HESITATION UPON ACCELERATION AS IF THE VEHICLE CUTS OFF AND THEN IT LUNGES ?????????\"     THEY SAID THERE IS NOTHING WRONG AS THIS IS AN INHERENT TOYOTA DESIGN FEATURE BECAUSE IT HAS ELECTRONIC THROTTLE AND THEY COULD HAVE SAVED ME A TRIP TO SEE THEM IF I HAD CALLED AND TOLD THEM THE PROBLEM.      THE SERVICE INVOICE STATES: \"TEST DROVE VEHICLE, PERFORMED DIAGNOSTIC TEST. NO DEFECT OF PARTS OR CRAFTSMANSHIP OF THIS VEHICLE.\"     THEY SAID I HAVE JUST A FEW THOUSAND MILES ON THE CAR AND THE COMPUTER IS LEARNING MY DRIVING HABITS AND MAY SETTLE DOWN AFTER A WHILE.  I HAVE OWNED MANY CARS OVER THE YEARS AND THINK I AM AWARE OF WHEN A CAR TENDS TO HESITATE ON ACCELERATION.

IN OCTOBER 2006, I WAS PULLING OUT OF A POST OFFICE PARKING LOT WHILE AWARE OF 2 CARS AT A SAFE DISTANCE AWAY.  WHEN IN THE INTERSECTION, 1 OF THE 2 CARS WAS TRAVELING MUCH FASTER THAN ANTICIPATED.  WHEN I ACCELERATED QUICKLY, THE CAR JUST SEEMED TO CHOKE, AND THE CAR COLLIDED INTO MY REAR SIDE (DRIVER'S SIDE).  I AND THE OTHER DRIVER HAD ONLY MINOR INJURIES, BUT THE COLLISION WAS VERY FRIGHTENING AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE.  I ALSO FELT THAT SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS WAS WRONG WITH MY CAR THAN I HAD THOUGHT.  AFTER I GOT MY CAR BACK FROM THE BODY REPAIR SHOP (7 WEEKS LATER), I TOOK IT INTO TO THE DEALER AND ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE PROBLEM.
