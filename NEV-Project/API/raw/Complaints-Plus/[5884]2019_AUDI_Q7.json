The Goodyear Eagle Sport run flat tires, 285/45-20, are commonly complained about on the Audit Q7 for poor wear patterns.  It is notable that Audi does not recommend or include tire rotations in the every 10k mile maintenance services, which we pre-paid for.  Tire rotations, it seems, is the only thing that can minimize the poor wear patterns.  Tires are always kept properly inflated, and car is driven gently.  Alignment is within specification.   More than a little ticked off that the OEM tires do not perform adequately throughout the life of the tread.  This is a known problem area, per the internet.",

I have to put it in park, start it then put it into drive to move forward again. This takes a bit of time. This is 1) very startling, 2) makes it likely for me to be rear-ended, and 3) my car can easily be hit head-on by a car in the oncoming lane. I luckily have not been in an accident yet.  This has occurred at least 5 times, with one additional time, the indicator and brakes being applied but the car did not stall.   The dealer has been notified twice about this problem, and says there is no known solution they know about.   This is a very serious problem.  In all instances, there are NO cars in sight in the oncoming lanes. These are all false alarms. The fact that there has not been a read-end collision yet is very surprising.",

I COULD MINIMIZE THE PROBLEM BY TURNING OFF THE AUTO START STOP BUTTON AND DRIVING THE CAR IN S MODE.  THIS HAD NOT HELPED THE PROBLEM WITH THE Q7.  AN ACQUAINTANCE OF MINE BOUGHT A Q8 RECENTLY AND HAS HAD THE SAME ISSUE TWO TIMES.  I HAD THE ISSUE ABOUT 10 TIMES WITH THE LOANER Q8 AND HUNDREDS OF TIMES WITH THE Q7.
