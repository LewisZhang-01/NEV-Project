I was able to pull off to the side of the freeway in a not so safe place however I had no choice. I out hazard lights on and turned off the car. After waiting approx 5 min. I attempted to start car to no avail. The battery light as well as abs light stayed on. I again waited for another 5 -10 min and tried again nothing but same warning lights. I eventually had to wait for approx 45-_60 min when it finally started however I was only allowed to go no fastethan 5 mph. I was able to exit freeway where I parked car for several hours and walked home. Upon retrieving vehicle it still had same results. I drove home @ 5mph. I  took car in for repairs and was told I needed a new battery wiring harness. I had that ordered a d repaired. Car drove home just fine however the following day the same incident occurred. Took car back in and was told I needed a new alternator which I replaced. However the following day the same thing occurred. Upon driving car back to a major dealership to notify them of the same problem, however once in their parking lot the mechanic attempted to drive car into the service bay and car wouldn't start. Immediately the mechanic said \" oh you hear that clicking sound?\"  \" That's the starter you need a new one\". I once  again  had them service my car and put in a new starter.Yet once again the following day the same problem. In all these occurrences the car had just out of no where with no warning lost power leaving my children  and I in a potentially dangerous situation multiple times. The vehicle has been parked in my garage. I can't afford replacing parts just to have the same incident.

THE VEHICLE IS USED PRIMARILY TO DRIVE TO AND FROM WORK ON PAVED HIGHWAYS. WHEN RESEARCHING THE ISSUE FURTHER, I NOTICED THAT THERE WERE MULTIPLE OTHER OWNERS OF FIRST GENERATION NISSAN MURANOS WHO EXPERIENCED SIMILAR ISSUES, INCLUDING ONE WHOSE FRAME ACTUALLY BROKE IN HALF WHILE DRIVING (THANKFULLY THAT DID NOT HAPPEN IN OUR CASE). THE ISSUE APPEARS TO RELATE TO THE FRAME AND/OR SEALANT ON THE FRAME CORRODING DUE TO THE SALT USED ON THE ROADS DURING THE WINTER TIME IN THE NORTHERN US. OUR VEHICLE IS DRIVEN IN MICHIGAN. NISSAN CONDUCTED RECALLS FOR SIMILAR ISSUES WITH OTHER MODELS (ALTIMA, PATHFINDER AND INFINITY QX4) WHICH SHOWS THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED EVENT. AS SUCH, I FEEL THIS ISSUE IS PRESENTS A SERIOUS SAFETY RISK TO THE DRIVER, PASSENGERS AND OTHER MOTORISTS. I CONTACTED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOT RECALL AND THAT I WOULD NEED TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP FOR THE REPAIR AND THEN SUBMIT A COMPLAINT WHICH WOULD BE ESCALATED TO THE REGIONAL TEAM BUT, THAT THEY WERE UNLIKELY TO PROVIDE ANY SUPPORT.

THE WORST PART OF THIS BEGAN A COUPLE MOUTHS AGO WHEN I WAS GETTING BACK FROM PENNSYLVANIA WITH MY FAMILY ON THE HIGHWAY DRIVEN AROUND 65 MILES AND UNEXPECTEDLY THIS HORRIBLE PROBLEM CAME \"THE DECELERATION\"FROM 65 IT WAS GETTING TO 30 MILES,  IT SCARED ME A LOT BUT I CONSIDERED MYSELF THAT I'M A GOOD DRIVER AND MY FIRST REACTION WAS TO LET THE MOTOR WORK BY ITSELF I DIDN'T TOUCH THE SPEED AND THE BRAKE AND I PULL OVER THE CAR WITH THE EMERGENCY LIGHTS I TURN IT OFF AND I WAITED 20 MINUTES AND THEN I TURN IT ON THE CAR AGAIN, FORTUNATELY IT WORKED AFTER THIS WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM I THOUGHT.    I LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY AND HONESTLY I DON'T NEED THE CAR IF I BOUGHT IS JUST FOR PLEASURE TO GO OUT THE CITY TO VACATION AND HERE I FIND OTHER PROBLEM; WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING SHORT DISTANCES LIKE HERE IN THE CITY  YOU DIDN'T NOTICE ABOUT THIS BUT THE PROBLEM IT COMES WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING  LONG DISTANCES OVER 50 MILES AND THEN THE MOTOR LOOSE POWER. THIS PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE EVERY TIME WHEN I DO THE IGNITION THEN 5 MINUTES LATTER THE MOTOR LOOSE POWER.    I CHANGE SEVERAL AUTO PARTS ON THE  ENGINE SYSTEM AND THE ELECTRICAL TOO, I THOUGHT THAT MAY BE THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM COULD BE THE PROBLEM A SENSOR A FUSIBLE OR SOMETHING BUT HOWEVER I STILL WITHOUT FIX THIS PROBLEM I DON'T WANT DRIVE ANY MORE THIS CAR BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW COULD BE THE REACTION OF THE CAR AGAIN ON A HIGHWAY, EVEN I DON'T WANT EVEN TRY TO SELL IT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WILL BE  BADNESS TO SELL AT SOMEBODY ON THAT CONDITION.

THE SITUATION SEEMS TO BE EXACERBATED BY HEAT AND DIRECT SUNLIGHT ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR.  MY CONCERN IS THAT NOT KNOWING IF THE DOOR IS LOCKED OR UNLOCKED CREATES A SAFETY HAZARD BOTH WHILE DRIVING AND IN THE EVENT OF A NEED FOR QUICK EXIT FROM THE VEHICLE.  SIMPLY LOOKING AT THE MANUAL LOCKING SWITCH CAN BE DECEPTIVE BECAUSE IT WILL MOVE INTO THE LOCKED POSITION WITHOUT FULLY ENGAGING THE LOCK.    FOR SAFETY REASONS I PREFER TO DRIVE WITH THE DOORS LOCKED. HAVING A SECURE ENVIRONMENT IS PARAMOUNT IN CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS. IF ANYONE CAN SIMPLY OPEN THE DOOR TO GAIN ACCESS, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASED RISK OF CARJACKING, INJURY, THEFT, ETC. HAVING THE DOORS LOCK CORRECTLY IS A BASIC SAFETY PRECAUTION.  ADDITIONALLY, IN EMERGENCIES IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO UNLOCK DOORS QUICKLY. IN THIS AUTOMATED AGE WE TEND TO RELY ON THE AUTOMATED SYSTEMS OF OUR VEHICLES AND IT'S UNFAMILIAR TO RESORT TO THE MANUAL LOCKING SYSTEM, WHICH AS I EXPLAINED ABOVE CAN BE DECEPTIVE.  I CAN EASILY UNDERSTAND HOW SOME PEOPLE WOULD BE CONFUSED HOW UNLOCK A DOOR USING THE MANUAL LEVEL IN AN EMERGENCY. IN EMERGENCIES EVERY SECOND COUNTS. THE LOCKING/UNLOCKING SOLENOID MALFUNCTIONING IS CLEARLY A HIGH RISK IN EMERGENCY SCENARIOS. THE DEALER CHARGES AN AVERAGE OF $1600 TO HAVE ALL THE SOLENOIDS REPLACED WHICH AMOUNTS TO MAKING THE OWNER PAY FOR A KNOWN SAFETY ISSUE.  AT THIS PRICE MANY WILL FORGO GETTING THE PROBLEM FIXED, PUTTING THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AT RISK WITH THE ABOVE MISHAP EXAMPLES. NISSAN SHOULD RECALL THE AFFECTED VEHICLES AND REPAIR THIS SAFETY ISSUE.   *KB",

I TURNED OFF THE CAR AND RESTARTED AND THE CAR RESPONDED FINE.  I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A FLUKE.  THEN 5 MONTHS LATER, I WAS IN A STOP AND OF TRAFFIC ON I80 ON MY WAY TO LAKE TAHOE.  THE CAR REFUSE TO MOVE WHEN I STEPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR AGAIN.  I STARTED PRESSING HARDER AND IT LURCHED FORWARD.  IT DID THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THE STOP AND GO TRAFFIC.  I FINALLY PULLED OVER AND CUT OFF THE ENGINE AND STARTED BACK UP; THE CAR RESPONDED FINE THEREAFTER.  HOWEVER, IT KEPT REPEATING THE SAME PROBLEM; EACH TIME I WILL RESOLVE IT BY RESTARTING THE CAR.  LUCKILY, IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY SO IT WAS REPLACED AT NO COST TO ME.  THE CAR PERFORMED WITHOUT FURTHER PROBLEM UNTIL 2006.  THE PROBLEM REARED ITS UGLY HEAD.  I TOOK IT BACK IN AND THEY SAID IT WAS A BAD BATTERY.  SO WE HAD THAT CHANGED, BUT THE PROBLEM CAME BACK.  THE MECHANIC RESET THE CAR COMPUTER AND THE PROBLEM WENT AWAY.  AGAIN, IT DIDN'T REALLY COST ME MUCH OTHER THAN THE BATTERY.  THEN IN 2009, THE CAR AGAIN STARTED DOING THE LURCHING THING IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC.  IT'S ALWAYS IN THE SAME SITUATION.  I KNEW I WAS OUT OF WARRANTY BY THEN AND IT WOULD COST ME AN ARM AND A LEG SO I JUST DEALT WITH IT BY RESTARTING THE CAR EACH TIME AND PRAY THE TRAFFIC WILL MOVE FASTER SOON.  IT'S NOW 2011 AND THE PROBLEM REMAINS.  AFTER READING ALL THE COMPLAINTS FROM PAST NISSAN MURANO OWNERS, I REALLY THINK NISSAN OWES US SOME MONEY.  IT SHOULD'VE BEEN A RECALL SINCE MOST OF US PAID $35K+ FOR THIS CAR.  MY CAR NOW HAS 145K MILES.  I AM IN THE MARKET FOR A NEW CAR.  I LIKE THE CVT. MAYBE WILL TRY A SUBARU INSTEAD.  *TR",

AS I UNDERSTAND IT NISSAN IS UNWILLING TO DO ANYTHING TO ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM OR PARTICIPATE IN THE REPAIR AFTER THE PART FAILS.  I PLAN TO HAVE THE NECESSARY REPAIRS MADE AND I WILL KEEP THE DEFECTIVE PARTS FOR INSPECTION.  I THINK IT WAS SIGNIFICANT THAT THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THAT MY CAR WOULD NOT PASS SAFETY INSPECTION IN VIRGINIA WITH A BROKEN SEAT.

TWO MONTHS AGO I TOOK IT TO RICK HILL NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THEM WHAT WAS HAPPENING.   HE HAD THE CAR A WEEK AND DROVE IT 66 MILES AND COULDN'T GET THE CAR TO DUPLICATE WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO ME.  UNFORTUNATELY, THEY WONT WORK ON THE CAR UNLESS IS HAS A CODE SHOWING UP TELLING THEM WHAT IS WRONG.  THIS PAST WEEK, I ALMOST RAN OVER MY FAMILY AS I WAS WAITING ON THEM TO COME OUT OF A STORE.  I PROCEEDED TO DRIVE UP TO THE STORE TO PICK THEM UP WHEN THE CAR SURGED AND THE ENGINE STARTED RACING.  I HAD TO SLAM ON THE BRAKES AND THROW THE CAR IN PARK TO GET IT TO STOP.  THE ENGINE AND RPM'S WERE STILL RACING AND 4,000 RPMS.   NO CODES WERE THROWN AND NO LIGHTS ON THE DASH AGAIN.   20 MINUTES LATER AS WE WERE COMING HOME, THE CAR LOST POWER AS IF THE TRANSMISSION SLIPPED INTO FIRST GEAR AND WE CREEPED ALL THE HOME AT 5 MPH, WITH ME HAVING THE PEDAL TO THE FLOOR.    THIS TIME THERE WERE CODES, BUT WHEN THE CAR WAS TURNED OFF IT WOULD NOT RESTART.  I HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME IT WAS THE IPDM.  825 DOLLARS FOR THE FIX. 51 MILES LATER THE CAR SLIPS AGAIN AND ACTS LIKE IT IS THROWN INTO FIRST GEAR.  NO LIGHTS, NO CODES.   AFTER READING MANY COMPLAINTS ON THE CVT TRANSMISSION IN THE 2003 MURANO I HAVE NO DOUBT THIS IS THE PROBLEM.   THIS DEFECT HAS PUT MY FAMILY IN MANY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS IN THE PAST YEAR. NISSAN INCREASED THE WARRANTY FOR THIS TRANSMISSION TO 120,000 MILES.  THIS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.   I TOOK MINE IN WITH 118,500 BUT THEY SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG,BECAUSE THEY HAD NO CODES SHOWING A PROBLEM. NOW WITH 128,000 I AM SCREWED.  THIS NEEDS TO BE A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT OR A RECALL ON THE CVT TRANSMISSION.  *TR",

THEN IN APRIL 2010 DRIVING DOWN THE STREET I HEARD A THUMP AND AS I PUSHED THE GAS AND THEN THE CAR BEGAN TO DRAG AND HESITATE.  I MADE IT SAFELY TO A BANK PARKING LOT WHERE I CALLED A TOW TRUCK TO TOW IT TO THE NISSAN DEALER AGAIN.  THIS TIME THEY SAY IT WAS SOME SENSOR THAT DEALT WITH THE THROTTLE AND A CASE. AGAIN AT MY EXPENSE ($3200).  SO IN 2 MONTHS I SPENT $4500 AND AT THAT TIME I WAS TOLD I SHOULD BE OK. WELL IT IS NOW APRIL 2011 AND I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AGAIN AND THIS TIME IT STOPPED WHILE I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK. NOW I HAD IT TOWED TO MY HOUSE WHICH ISS WERE IT SITS BECAUSE I WAS TOLD SINE I WENT MORE THAN 12K MILES IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  SO I NOW HAVE A CAR THAT IS USELESS UNLESS I SPEND ANOTHER $4500 TO FIX IT.  UNEXCEPTABLE!!!!!!!

HOWEVER IT'S CLEAR THAT SEVERAL OTHER 2003 NISSAN MURANO OWNERS ARE REPORTING THE \"CATASTROPHIC\" STALL PROBLEM - A SIMPLE GOOGLE SEARCH BEARS THIS OUT. TO ME IT SEEMS THAT NISSAN IS WASHING ITS HANDS OFF THE PROBLEM.    HERE ARE SOME SYMPTOMS:    1) WHEN DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, THE CAR CATASTROPHICALLY LOST POWER FOR SEVERAL SECONDS - ONLY TO SOMEWHAT RECOVER THEREAFTER. AT THE TIME OF RECOVERY MANYLIGHTS ON THE DASHBOARD LIT UP INCLUDING \"CHECK ENGINE\" \"AWD LOCK / SLIP\" ETC. THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED THREE TIMES IN A ROW - AND I CALLED NISSAN FOR HELP.    2) I LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO. WHEN WAITING AT A STOP SIGN TO CROSS UPHILL, THE CAR SIMPLY DOES NOT RESPOND WHEN I PRESS ON THE GAS PEDAL AND STARTS ROLLING DOWNHILL INSTEAD.    3) SIMILARLY IN STOP AND GO SITUATIONS - THE CAR SIMPLY DOES NOT RESPOND TO THE GAS PEDAL - AND THEN WHEN IT FINALLY DOES LURCHES FORWARD IN A DANGEROUS, OUT-OF-CONTROL FASHION INCREASING THE CHANCES OF REAR-ENDING THE CAR AHEAD. *TR",

AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE VEHICLE \"REALIZES\" I AM PRESSING THE ACCELERATOR AND TAKES OFF AT EXCESSIVE SPEED/RPMS.  THE PROBLEM HAS PUT ME IN VERY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS SUCH AS WHEN I AM TRYING TO MAKE A LEFT HAND TURN ACROSS TRAFFIC AND SUDDENLY STALLS.

BY THE TIME MY VEHICLE DECIDED TO GO, ANOTHER VEHICLE WAS APPROACHING IN THE LANE I WAS TRYING TO TURN ONTO AND I HAD TO SLAM ON MY BRAKES TO AVOID PULLING OUT IN FRONT OF THE ONCOMING VEHICLE AND CAUSING A WRECK.  SEVERAL VEHICLES WERE BEHIND ME WAITING TO GET ONTO THE SAME HIGHWAY AND WERE VERY AGGRAVATED I WAS HOLDING UP TRAFFIC SINCE MY VEHICLE WAS STALLING.    THE PROBLEMS OCCURS AS REGULARLY AS I SIT IDLE IN TRAFFIC OR GET INTO A CONGESTED TRAFFIC AREA.  EVERY SINGLE TIME.   AFTER READING HUNDREDS OF EARLY YEAR MURANO OWNERS ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM, I FEEL NISSAN SHOULD RECOGNIZE THIS AS A DEFECT AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS COSTLY DANGER.  I HAVE READ THAT MANY HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE CVT TRANSMISSION AND THAT NISSAN IS OFTEN MISDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM.  A CODE READER INDICATED MY TPS SENSOR WAS BAD.  I CHANGED IT WITH BARELY ANY NOTICEABLE CHANGES.  LATER A DEALER'S CODE READER SAID I SHOULD REPLACE THE CADILLAC CONVERTER.  AFTER THAT PRICEY REPAIR, I STILL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.

NISSAN TOLD ME THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG AND SO NOTHING WAS REPAIRED.  IN ON DECEMBER 3, 2009 I WAS LEAVING MY PARKING GARAGE AT WORK AND MY CAR STALLED OUT COMPLETELY; IT THEN TOOK 15 MINUTES BEFORE IT WOULD RE-START.

TWO WEEKS LATER, I WAS TRAVELING AT 50 MPH WHEN MY CAR COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN, NEARLY CAUSING AN ACCIDENT WITH MY 7 YEAR-OLD IN THE CAR WITH ME.  AFTER THAT, MY SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND I HAD LOSS OF ENGINE POWER.  I THEN HAD THE CAR TOWED TO MY MECHANIC ON 1/21, WHERE HE RAN A DIAGNOSTIC AND FOUND THAT MY CRANK POSITION SENSOR AND CAM POSITION SENSOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.

WHEN I WAS GETTING A RECALL COMPLETED I WAS TELLING THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEE ABOUT MY LOW OIL LEVEL WHEN I TOOK MY CAR EVERY 3,000 MILES. HE ASKED IF I HAD ANY OIL LEAKS THAT WERE LEFT ON THE GROUND WHEN I MOVED MY CAR. I LET HIM KNOW THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN OIL ON THE GROUND. I ALSO LET HIM KNOW THAT I HEAR A RATTLING NOISE SOMETIMES WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A STOPPED POSITION AND SOMETIMES MY CAR GETS STUCK WHEN I TRY TO ACCELERATE AND THEN AFTER A FEW SECONDS IT WILL ZOOM FORWARD. I HAVE ALMOST REAR ENDED AROUND 6 CARS. I TRY TO LET CARS GET A LITTLE WAYS IN FRONT OF ME IF IT GETS STUCK SO I DO NOT REAR END THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THIS. HE SAID THAT THE RECALL OF THE ALTERNATOR WOULD FIX THE ISSUES WITH THE CAR GETTING STUCK AND THEY WOULD CHECK THE ENGINE.  I STILL HAVE THIS PROBLEM TODAY WITH THE CAR GETTING STUCK. I HAD AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST DONE EVERY 1,000 MILES AND BY TIME I MADE IT TO THE 2,000 MILES MY OIL LEVEL WAS LOW. SO THEY NEVER DID A THIRD OIL CONSUMPTION TEST LIKE THEY SAID THEY WOULD. THEN I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE ENGINE. I HAVE SEEN MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE. I FEEL THAT THE ENGINES THAT WERE PLACED IN THE 2003 NISSAN MURANOS WERE DEFECTIVE AND SHOULD BE RECALLED BECAUSE THIS COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT AND I HAVE A 14 MONTH OLD SON IN MY CAR WITH ME 90% OF THE TIME. THEREFORE NOT ONLY IS MY LIFE AND OTHERS IN CARS AROUND ME IN JEOPARDY SO IS MY SON'S LIFE.

UPON CLOSER INSPECTION IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE BRACKET ON WHICH THE PULLEY IS MOUNTED HAD FAILED CAUSING THE PULLEY TO BE PUSHED OUT OF ALIGNMENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY DAMAGING THE HOSE AND BELT, RESULTING IN A REPAIR COST OF $450.27.   THE REPAIR CONSISTED OF REPLACING ALL THE EFFECTED COMPONENTS AT MY EXPENSE. AS FAR AS I KNOW, THE \"DEFECTIVE BRACKET\" WAS REPLACED WITH AN IDENTICAL ITEM SHARING THE SAME DEFECTIVE QUALITIES. NISSAN WILL NOT DIVULGE THE REASON FOR THE BRACKETS FAILURE. MY CONCERN IS: IF THIS \"PULLEY DEVISE\" HAD BROKEN OFF THE VEHICLE DUE TO THE FAILURE OF THE BRACKET WHILE I WAS DRIVING AT SPEED, IT WOULD HAVE DONE INCALCULABLE DAMAGE ,POSSIBLY CAUSING ME TO LOOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE, PROBABLY CAUSING AN ACCIDENT RESULTING IN INJURY OR LOSS OF LIFE.   WHEN I ASKED THE SERVICE MANAGER WHAT CAUSED THE BRACKET TO FAIL, HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW, BUT THAT I SHOULD CONSIDER MYSELF FORTUNATE THAT HE DISCOVERED THE PROBLEM WHEN HE DID. APPARENTLY, OTHER OWNERS WERE NOT SO FORTUNATE, THEIR CARS HAD TO BE TOWED AND THE DAMAGE WAS MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE. AFTER THE REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED I ASKED TO BE GIVEN THE DEFECTIVE AND DAMAGED PARTS AND NOW HAVE THEM IN MY POSSESSION. *TR",

I LEARNED TODAY THAT THIS WAS NONSENSE.  I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM A REPUTABLE DEALER AND ONLY HAD THE CAR SERVICED BY NISSAN.  WHERE WOULD THE FLUID GET INTO MY RIDE IN THAT CASE?  I BOUGHT A WARRANTY ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE DEALERS REPRESENTATIVE WHO INFORMED ME THAT I WOULD WANT COVERAGE FOR THE TRANSMISSION IN HOPES OF AVOIDING THE $5,000.00 TAG FOR REPLACEMENT.

THE OTHER COMMON PROBLEM OCCURS WHILE VEH IS AT A COMPLETE STOP AND THEN THE ACCELERATOR IS PRESSED IN ORDER TO PROCEED (I.E. THROUGH AN INTERSECTION), THE VEH WILL NOT MOVE FOR SEVERAL SECONDS WHILE CONTINUING TO PRESS THE ACCEL PEDAL. THEN, VERY ABRUPTLY THE VEH WILL SHOOT INTO THE INTERSECTION AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED.  ***  THIS SEEMS TO BE A CONTINUING BUT INTERMITTENT PROBLEM. IT OCCURS WITHOUT WARNING-SOMETIMES AT HIGH SPEEDS ON A FREEWAY, OFTEN AT LOW SPEEDS IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC.    RECENTLY, WHILE ON A VERY BUSY AND DANGEROUS ROADWAY IN LEXINGTON,KY DURING RUSH HOUR, I EXPERIENCED THE INABILITY TO REACH THE SPEED LIMIT OF 55 MPH. WHILE ATTEMPTING TO REACH THE SPEED, THE TACHOMETER (RPM) WOULD INCREASE TO NEAR WARNING (RED ZONE) LEVELS.

MY SON CHRIS WILSON AGE 22 WAS DRIVING  THE MURANO ON MARCH 14, 2007 NEAR HIS COLLEGE IN CULLOWHEE,  NORTH CAROLINA  WHEN WHILE AT HIGHWAY SPEED NOTICED THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ILLUMINATED AND THEN EXPERIENCED AN IMMEDIATE LOSS OF POWER AND ENGINE SHUTDOWN.

AFTER AN ANALYSIS AND THE PART NUMBER OF A TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE TCM.  I WENT TO THE NISSAN USA WEB SITE AND RESEARCHED RECALLS THAT HAD BEEN ISSUED FOR 2003 MURANOS.  I WAS VERY INTERESTED TO FIND ONE FOR VIN NUMBERSJN8AZ08T*3W 100007-100032,JN8AZ08W* 200005-200071.

MURANO DRIVER WAS ROUNDING SWEEPING RIGHT-HAND CURVE ON FAMILIAR ROAD AND ENDED UP IN ONCOMING LANE. DRIVER APPARENTLY TRIED TO STEER BACK INTO PROPER LANE, BUT WAS UNABLE TO DO SO, APPARENTLY BECAUSE STEERING UNEXPECTEDLY BECAME VERY STIFF AND HARD TO TURN WHEN TRYING  TO TURN QUICKLY TO AVOID CRASH. CRASH KILLED MURANO DRIVER INSTANTLY, AND INJURED DRIVER AND OCCUPANTS OF ONCOMING PICK-UP TRUCK.  EXTENSIVE RESEARCH IN PUBLIC SOURCES HAS FOUND THAT CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS ACCIDENT MIRROR PROBLEMS WITH SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER STEERING-ASSIST EXPERIENCED BY NUMEROUS MURANO DRIVERS IN ACCIDENTS AND NEAR-ACCIDENTS AT NORMAL DRIVING SPEEDS, AS IN OTHER COMPLAINTS ON NHTSA WEBSITE AND NISSAN OWNER WEBSITES, AND AS FOUND BY CONSUMERS REPORTS ACCIDENT AVOIDANCE MANEUVER TESTING.  THIS IS A DESIGN ISSUE,WITH STEERING PUMP BASED ON LIGHTER ALTIMA UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH QUICK STEERING INPUTS. INTERPLAY OF CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION AND DRIVE-BY-WIRE THROTTLE MAY ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO PROBLEM BY CREATING POSSIBILITY OF RAPID DROP IN RPM WHEN DRIVER QUICKLY TAKES FOOT OFF ACCELERATOR, AS IN EMERGENCY. IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER OTHER PROBLEMS WITH CAR'S STEERING PERFORMANCE ALSO LED TO INITIAL CROSSING INTO ONCOMING LANE.  NISSAN CHANGED STEERING PUMP IN 2005 AND LATER MODELS TO DEAL WITH PROBLEM. DRIVERS OF 2003 AND 2004 MODELS ARE STILL AT RISK FOR LOSS OF POWER STEERING WHEN THEY MOST NEED IT. WHEN LOSS OCCURS IN PARALLEL PARKING IT IS AN INCONVENIENCE; WHEN IT HAPPENS UNEXPECTEDLY WHILE DRIVING, ESPECIALLY WHEN TRYING TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT, IT IS LIFE-THREATENING, AS IN THIS CASE. BECAUSE IT IS A DESIGN FEATURE, ALL 2003 AND 2004 MURANOS ARE SUBJECT TO THIS PROBLEM. MURANO OWNERS (AND DEALERS) SHOULD BE NOTIFIED IMMEDIATELY OF THIS DANGEROUS DESIGN DEFECT.

VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM NISSAN NORTH AMERICA.

AFTER CONTACTING UNIVERSITY DEALERSHIP IN LANSING, MI ON JULY 23RD 2004, I WAS INFORMED TO BRING IT IN RIGHT AWAY.  I DROVE IT ABOUT 10 MILES THAT DAY WITHOUT A CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR FROM THE VEHICLE BUT THE LAMPS WERE STILL ON.  LATER THAT DAY I WAS INFORMED IT WOULD NEED A NEW ALTERNATOR.  I DID NOT HEAR ABOUT ANY PROGRESS UNTIL AUGUST 2ND 2004 WHICH IS 10 DAYS LATER.  THE DEALERSHIP CLAIMED THE ALTERNATOR WAS ORDERED THE PREVIOUS FRIDAY (30 JULY) AND SHOULD BE IN \"LATE TODAY OR TOMORROW\".  I RECEIVED NO UPDATE UNTIL 7 DAYS LATER (AUGUST 10TH) WHEN I CALLED THE DEALER AND WAS INFORMED THE ALTERNATOR HAD COME IN AND IT SHOULD BE DONE THE NEXT DAY.  ON AUGUST 10TH, I WAS ALLOWED TO PICK UP THE REPAIRED VEHICLE.  IN TOTAL I WAS WITHOUT THE VEHICLE FOR 18 CONSECUTIVE DAYS WHILE WAITING FOR A REPLACEMENT FOR A FAULTY ALTERNATOR WHICH ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY.  I WAS STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING LOAN PAYMENTS DURING THE 18 DAYS I WAS NOT ABLE TO USE THE VEHICLE AND HAD TO ARRANGE ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION TO WHERE I WORK.    THE NATURE OF THE FAILURE COULD HAVE LEAD TO A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN AS THE ANTILOCK BRAKES WERE DISABLED, AND IF THE VEHICLE HAD LOST POWER (SOME DO, SOMETIMES DUE TO SIMULTANEOUS BATTERY FAILURE) CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE COULD HAVE BEEN LOST.  IT IS ALSO AN IMPOSITION ON THE CUSTOMER TO HAVE TO WAIT AN EXTENDED PERIOD FOR REPLACEMENTS TO BE DELIVERED FOR COMMONLY FAULTY PARTS.
