THINGS WE'VE TRIED WITH NO LUCK ARE, DISENGAGING THE CRUISE CONTROL, REPLACING THE SPRING UNDER HOOD WHERE THE THROTTLE CABLE IS. THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS STRETCHED AND NOT DEPRESSING FULLY TO ALOW DECELERATION. AFTER THAT WE REPLACED THE THROTTLE BODY ITSELF. AGAIN, NO LUCK ON TEST DRIVE.

HAVE TRIED TO STICK FOOT UNDER THE PEDAL TO TRY AND GET IT TO DISENGE. WORKED THE FIRST FEW TIMES THAT'S ALSO WHY THOUGHT IT WAS THE SPRING. NO LONGER WORKS TO DO THAT.

I HAVE EVEN LOST CONTROL OF THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WHILE DRIVING, THE RAIN DRIPS ON MY FEET AND SOAKS THE FLOOR MAT EVEN IF IT JUST SITTING. THE LATEST ISSUE IS WITH AN EJECTED SPARK PLUG WHICH FORTUNATELY DID NOT START A FIRE JUST LEAVING ME STRANDED TWICE IN ONE WEEK. I AM TOLD THERE IS NO GOOD FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM AND I AM GETTING ESTIMATES AS HIGH AS $3500. MOST SAY THAT THIS VEHICLE HAS ONE DESIGN FLAW AFTER ANOTHER AND THAT FORD ONLY GIVES ONE EXCUSE AFTER ANOTHER. SO MANY PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE THE SAME EXACT PROBLEMS I CAN'T HELP BUT TO THINK THE FAULT LIES WITH FORD. SO MANY OTHER THINGS HAVE GONE WRONG WITH IT TO FIX THEM ALL WOULD BE REPLACING EVERY PART, WIRE, AND DEVICE ON IT. I THINK IT'S JUST A LEMON DESIGNED TO CREATE REVENUE.

THE NEXT DAY MANY OTHER PROBLEMS POPPED UP SEVERAL DASH LIGHT WERE FLASHING ON AND OFF, WHEN THIS WAS HAPPENING YOU COULD HERE RELAYS UNDER THE DASH CLICKING ON AND OFF.

I DID MORE RESEARCH ON LINE AND FOUND THAT A INVESTIGATION WAS DONE ON THIS ISSUE BY NHTSA THE ACTION NUMBER WAS EA05015 IT WAS CONDUCTED IN 2005. FROM THE LOOKS OF IT THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR A LONG TIME THAT HAS AFFECTED MANY PEOPLE BUT STILL NO ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN.

A FEW MONTHS INTO OUR OWNERSHIP, WE WERE TRAVELING ON THE FREEWAY AND GOING OVER A OVERPASS AT 60 MILES AN HOUR THE SPARE TIRE DROPPED OFF THE SUV AND ROLLED ACROSS FOUR LANES OF TRAFFIC AT NIGHT. LUCKILY, IT DID NOT KILL SOMEONE. THEN ABOUT 8 OR 9 MONTHS AGO IT HAPPENED AGAIN JUST BACKING OUT OF OUR DRIVEWAY. INSPECTING THE PROBLEM IT IS CLEAR THE STEEL CABLE HOIST HOLDING THE TIRE UP UNDER THE REAR IS BREAKING UNDER STRESS. IT IS CLEAR THIS IS A DESIGN DEFECT AND A VERY REAL SAFETY ISSUE. WE HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND I HAVE CALLED THEIR 800 NUMBER. THEY CLAIM THE VEHICLE IS OUTSIDE THE WARRANTY PERIOD. I SAY THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT FORD SHOULD NOT ONLY FIX BUT SHOULD REDESIGN THE WHOLE MOUNTING SYSTEM TO BETTER SUPPORT THE TIRE.  THE TIRE AND RIM SHOULD HAVE A POSITIVE LOCKING DEVICE THAT SECURELY HOLDS THE TIRE IN PLACE SO THE STEEL CABLE HOIST IS USED ONLY TO RAISE AND LOWER THE TIRE WHEN THE VEHICLE IS AT REST. FORD WILL NOT PUT THIS IN WRITING.  I HAVE FILED COMPLAINTS ON THIS ISSUE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE DMV AND OTHER AGENCIES - THEY ARE REFERRING ME TO MEDIATION BOARDS TO SETTLE IT FINANCIALLY.  BUT THE FORD FIX OF INSTALLING ANOTHER STEEL CABLE HOIST SYSTEM IS NOT SAFE.  I AM CONSIDERING A THIRD PARTY MOUNTING SYSTEM TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT THIS TO HAPPEN AGAIN.  PRESENTLY, I AM DRIVING WITHOUT THE SPARE TIRE BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT ANOTHER FORD FIX AND IT WOULD BE UNSAFE CARRYING IT INSIDE THE VEHICLE. YOU ARE MY LAST CHANCE OF RESOLVING THIS SAFETY ISSUE.

IT WAS OUT OF SIGHT, CONTRARY TO FORD'S ASCERTION.     3. ODI'S RATIONAL FOR NOT RECOMMENDING A RECALL IS THAT NOT ENOUGH PERCENTAGE COULD BE ESTABLISHED AS A RESULT OF SERVICE RECORDS AND CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS TO NHSTA.  IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO CONTACT SOME OF THE OWNERS THAT HAD GEM PROBLEMS AND LEAKS;  AND ASK THEM IF THEY HAD THEIR WIPERS STOP...

ON MY WAY HOME, AGAIN ON THE FREEWAY IN THE RAIN, THE WIPER LIGHT & THE 4X4 LIGHT WOULD FLASH OFF & ON AT THE SAME TIME & AGAIN, THE AT TIMES THE WIPERS WOULD NOT WORK PROPERLY.  THE NEXT MORNING AS I DROVE TO WORK, AGAIN IN THE RAIN, ONLY THE 4X4 LIGHT WAS FLASHING & THE REAR WIPER WOULD NOT WORK.  ALSO, THE FRONT WIPERS DID NOT WORK INTERMITTENTLY.  I SPECIFICITY RECALL TURNING THE HEATER FAN OFF THAT MORNING BEFORE LEAVING THE VEHICLE.  AFTER WORK, I ATTEMPTED TO UNLOCK MY VEHICLE W/THE REMOTE UNLOCK & IT WOULD NOT UNLOCK.  I MANUALLY UNLOCKED THE VEHICLE & THE DASH LIGHTS WERE ON.  IT LOOKED LIKE I HAD NOT TURNED THE KEY OFF ALL OF THE WAY, BUT I DID!  AND THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT START.  I HAD TO WALK A COUPLE OF MILES TO MY HUSBAND'S WORK & HE HAD TO TAKE HIS LUNCH EARLY TO BRING ME HOME.  FORD HAD BETTER GET A RECALL OUT ON THIS.

WE HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON OUR EXPEDITION SO WE TOOK IT TO GERMAIN FORD IN COLUMBUS, OHIO.  THEY SAID THE LEFT FRONT STABILIZER LINK BOLT HAD BROKE IN HALF AND THE STABILIZER BAR WAS SLIPPING ON AND OFF CAUSING THE MOVEMENT AND SOUND.  THEY TOLD ME THIS WAS NOT A WARRANTY ITEM.  MY EXPEDITION HAS ONLY 51,000 MILES AND IS DRIVEN BY MY WIFE TO WORK.   AT THE SAME TIME THE DEALER TOLD ME BY BALL JOINTS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  I SAID HOW CAN A STEEL BOLT IN THE STEERING LINKAGE ACTUALLY BRAKE AND NOT BE COVERED? I ASKED FOR THE SERVICE MGR AND HE ACTUALLY SAID TO ME \"THEY DON'T MAKE THINGS LIKE THEY USE TO\".  I THEN RECALLED A SERVICE NOTICE SOME TIME BACK ABOUT SOMETHING IN THE FRONT END OF EXPEDITIONS SO I LOOKED THROUGH MY FILES.  SURE ENOUGH, FORD SENT OUT A SERVICE BULLETIN IN 6-04 \"TITLED TIE ROD INSPECTION PROCEDURE\".   WHILE THE SERVICE BULLETIN COVERS A COUPLE ITEMS IT BELIEVE IT SHOWS FORD KNEW THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE FRONT ENDS AND SENT OUT A SERVICE NOTICE TO EXCUSE THEMSELVES AND TO AVOID PAYING FOR REPAIRS.  WHEN THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THEY WOULD NOT COVER, I CALLED THE WARRANTY HOTLINE.  THE REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME \"BALL JOINTS ARE WEARING OUT SOONER THEN THEY WOULD EXPECT\" BUT IT WAS NOT A WARRANTY ITEM SO I HAD TO GET THOSE REPAIRED AS WELL.  IN SUMMARY, I BELIEVE THE BOLT BREAKING COULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE AND THAT FOR A CUSTOMER TO SPEND $800 TO REPLACE A BROKEN BOLT IN THE FRONT LINKAGE AND BALL JOINTS ON AN EXCELLENT CONDITION VEHICLE WITH ONLY 51,000 MILES IS OUTRAGEOUS.

I DON'T MIND PAYING FOR REPAIRS IF THEY ARE WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS, BUT DUE TO ALL THE OTHER COMPLAINTS AND SERVICE BULLETINS I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A NORMAL CAR REPAIR.                 RECALL DATE: MAY 13, 1998   COMPONENT: WHEELS:LUGS/NUTS/BOLTS   POTENTIAL UNITS AFFECTED: 1520000   SUMMARY: VEHICLE DESCRIPTION: MULTI-PURPOSE VEHICLES AND LIGHT DUTY PICKUP TRUCKS. THE LUG NUTS ON THESE VEHICLES MAY NOT CREATE SUFFICIENT CLAMP LOAD ALLOWING WHEEL MOVEMENT IN RELATION TO THE HUB/ROTOR MOUNTING SURFACE.   CONSEQUENCE: THIS CAN RESULT IN THE LOOSENING OF LUG NUTS, STUD FATIGUE FAILURE, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR A WHEEL SEPARATION FROM THE VEHICLE, INCREASING THE RISK OF A VEHICLE CRASH.   REMEDY: OWNERS OF THESE VEHICLES WILL BE RECEIVING TWO NOTIFICATIONS. THE FIRST NOTIFICATION, WHICH BEGAN IN MAY 1998, WILL PROVIDE AN INTERIM REPAIR PROCEDURE UNTIL PARTS BECOME AVAILABLE. THIS INTERIM PROCEDURE CAN BE COMPLETED BY OWNERS OR THEIR DEALERS. IT SPECIFIES THAT THE LUG NUT TORQUE MUST BE VERIFIED TO BE 100 LBS. THEN THE LUG NUTS NEED TO BE TIGHTENED AN ADDITIONAL 1/8 TO 1/4 TURN MORE. THERE WILL BE A SECOND OWNER NOTIFICATION, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN JULY 20, 1998, UNDER WHICH DEALERS WILL INSPECT THE WHEEL STUDS AND REPLACE THE WHEEL LUG NUTS.   NOTES: FORD MOTOR COMPANY. *JB",

THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN IDLE AND TURNED OFF FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE (1) HOUR WHEN THE EVENT OCCURRED.  UPON THE VEHICLE BEING STARTED THE NEXT DAY, THE HORN WOULD NOT WORK, THE ABS SYSTEM LIGHT WAS ILLUMINATED AND THE CRUISE CONTROL WOULD NOT ENGAGE.  IN APRIL 2004, THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH WAS REPLACED. IN LATE MAY, THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH WAS STILL INOPERATIVE AFTER REPLACEMENT.  ON JUNE 14,2005 THE COMPLAINTS CALLED FORD WITH THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT THE VEHICLE WAS CONTINUING TO SHORT OUT IN VARIOUS WAYS INCLUDING PLACING THE VEHICLE IN THE DRIVE POSITION AND A NEW PROBLEM OF THE RADIO SYSTEM WOULD MALFUNCTION.  WHEN PLACED BACK IN PARK,THE RADIO WAS RE-ACTIVATE.  VEHICLE WAS EXAMINED BY PARKER FORD AND THEY ADVISED THE HORN CIRCUIT HAD BEEN OVERLOADED AND A FUSE BLOWN IN THE HORN MODULE.  THEY ALSO ADVISED THE ABS MODULE AND PUMP WERE IN NEED OF REPLACEMENT. THE COMPLAINANT BELIEVES THIS VEHICLE REPRESENTS A CONTINUING FIRE HAZARD AND THAT THE DAMAGED COMPONENT FAILURES, ALL OF WHICH OCCURRED AT THE SAME TIME WERE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE DEFECTIVE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH.

I WALKED OUTSIDE TO LEAVE AND MY MOTHER AND I STOOD IN THE DRIVEWAY AND TALKED FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES OR SO.  AT ONE POINT MY MOTHER NOTICED SMOKE STARTED POURING  FROM MY HOOD.  THE TRUCK HAD BEEN PARKED IN THE DRIVEWAY FOR AN HOUR OR SO AND WAS NOT RUNNING AT THE TIME.  I POPPED THE HOOD AND SMOKE WAS POURING FROM MY MASTER BRAKE CYLINDER.  AND WITH IN A MINUTE FLAMES  STARTED TO COME FROM THAT AREA.  I IMMEDIATELY HOOKED THE WATER HOSE UP AND PUT OUT THE FLAMES.  I HAD IT TOWED AND SPOKE WITH INSURANCE, AND THEY AGREED TO COVER THE DAMAGES.  THIS MORNING, I NOTICED ON THE YAHOO HEADLINES THAT FORD IS RECALLING 800,000 VEHICLES. I READ THE ARTICLE AND IT SIAD IT ONLY AFFECTED THE 2000 MODEL EXPEDITIONS AND F150'S AND NAVIGATORS.  IT STATED THAT THE DEFECT WAS CAUSED FROM THE CRUISE CONTROL SHORTINGT OUT AND CAUSE FIRES UNDER THE HOOD.  I ALSO READ THE 3 FIRES HAD BEEN REPORTED. I GUESS I AM #37.  MY CRUSIE CONTROL STOPPED WORKING OVER A YEAR AGO, BUT IT WAS LONG OUT OF WARRANTY AND I NEVER FELT THE NEED TO GET IT FIXED, IT WASNT A BIG DEAL TO ME.  BUT HAD I NOT BEEN OUTSIDE WHEN THE FIRE STARTED IT WOULD HAVE BURNT THE TRUCK TO THE GROUND, PROBABLY  THE BRAND NEW NISSAN TITAN PARKED NEXT TO IT AND POSSIBLY EVEN THE HOUSE COULD HAVE RECIEVED DAMAGE.

AFTER RUNNING SEVERAL STOP LIGHTS, DRIVING RECKLESS TO GET TO A SAFE PLACE TO STOP, I ENDED UP LEAVING MY TRUCK PARKED IN A PARKING LOT FOR THE WEEKEND.  I DROVE THE TRUCK TO A FORD DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME THAT NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH IT.  IT HAPPENED AGAIN A COUPLE DIFFERENT TIMES ON MY WAY TO WORK IN WHICH I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THEY DISCOVERED THE PROBLEM AND TOLD ME TO CONTINUE DRIVING IT UNTIL THEY GOT THE PART IN.  I ENDED UP HAVING TO PAY FOR HALF OF THE BILL DESPITE IT BEING FORD'S ISSUE.  PLUS, I ENDED UP HAVING TO BUY NEW BREAKS DUE TO THEM BEING WORN OUT HAVING TO FIGHT THE SPEED ACCELERATION WITH MY BREAKS.  THIS PAST SUNDAY, IT HAS STARTED AGAIN.  WE LEFT THE PALACE OF AUBURN HILLS AND THE TRUCK WAS SAYING WE WERE GOING 100 MILES AN HOUR DOWN LAPEER RD WITH TRAFFIC!  WHAT ON EARTH AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?  KEEP DRIVING THIS TRUCK AND RISK MY LIFE, MY 6 WEEK OLD SON'S LIFE, OR SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE?  I'M SCARED TO DEATH TO DRIVE THIS TRUCK BUT I CAN'T AFFORD TO GET OUT OF THE LEASE OR FIGHT FORD WITH AN ATTORNEY.  HELP!*AK",

WHEN I TRIED TO STOP AT SEVERAL RESIDENTIAL STOP SIGNS NEAR THE GYM, THE EXPEDITION WOULD NOT BRAKE AND PROCEEDED TO RUN THROUGH THE STOP SIGNS.  THE EXPEDITION WOULD NOT STOP AND STAYED STUCK ON 30 MPH.  I CALLED 911 FOR ASSISTANCE.  THE OPERATOR TOLD ME TO PUT MY PARKING BRAKE ON, AND I DID.  WHEN THIS ACTION DID NOT STOP THE CAR, SHE SUGGESTED THAT I SHIFT TO A LOWER GEAR.  I DID, AND STILL THE EXPEDITION WOULD NOT STOP.  I HAD TO DRIVE DOWN A STEEP HILL WITHOUT THE PROTECTION OF BRAKES.  AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL WAS A TRAFFIC LIGHT AT AN INTERSECTION.  I COULD NOT STOP OR SLOW DOWN.  I HAD TO TURN RIGHT GOING STILL 30 MPH.  I COULD ONLY HONK MY HORN TO CALL THE ATTENTION OF ONCOMING CARS TO THE FACT THAT I WAS COMING AND THAT I COULD NOT STOP.  AFTER MAKING THE RIGHT TURN, THE OPERATOR ASKED ME IF WE WERE SLOWING DOWN AT ALL.  I REPLIED NO AND THAT THE EXPEDITION REMAINED AT 30 MPH AND WAS NOT SLOWING DOWN.  ABOUT ONE MINUTE AFTER HER QUESTION, JUST LIKE THAT, THE CAR SLOWED DOWN AND STOPPED.  THE EAST PEORIA POLICE OFFICERS (WHO BY THIS TIME WERE ON THE SCENE) TOLD ME TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND I DID.  THEY DROVE THE EXPEDITION TO THE SIDE OF THE STREET FOR ME.  IT WAS THE SINGLE MOST TERRIFYING MOMENT OF MY LIFE.  AFTER THE INCIDENT TWO SEPARATE MECHANICS FROM TWO DIFFERENT BUSINESSES CONCLUDED THAT THE BRAKES WERE FINE.  MY HUSBAND HAS CONTACTED FORD AND THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP.  BOTH HAVE DENIED KNOWING OF ANY SUCH PREVIOUS INCIDENTS (WHICH ARE CLEARLY DOCUMENTED IN THIS FORUM).  AS OF TODAY, FORD HAS TAKEN NEITHER RESPONSIBILITY OR ACTION.

SEVERAL MONTHS PASSED WITH THE SAME NOISE BEING HEARD AFTER STARTING THE VEHICLE OR WHILE DRIVING.  DURING THE FIRST MAINTENANCE APPOINTMENT I QUESTIONED THIS NOISY COMPRESSOR AGAIN.  THE MECHANIC SAID, EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD, NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, IT'S COMMON FOR THE EXPEDITIONS TO DO THIS.  I QUESTIONED THIS COMPRESSOR NOISE EACH TIME I TOOK IT IN FOR SCHEDULE MAINTENANCE.  AS ALWAYS, I WAS TOLD IT WAS NORMAL.  I WAS CONCERNED THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG, BECAUSE IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM NORMAL FOR THIS NOISE TO HAPPEN CONSTANTLY.  ON FEBRUARY 9, 2002 I HAD TWO RECALLS PERFORMED. ONCE AGAIN I HAD THE DEALERSHIP CHECK THE NOISY COMPRESSOR.  THE WORK ORDERED STATED, CK AIR RIDE AIR PUMP & CUSTOMER STATES PUMP IS VERY NOISY.  MECHANIC INDICATED, CKD & NO ABNORMAL NOISES AT THIS TIME.   ON JULY 28, 2003 THE SUSPENSION COMPRESSOR FINALLY STOPPED WORKING.  A NEW SUSPENSION COMPRESSOR WAS INSTALLED.  THE MECHANIC INDICATED THAT THE OLD COMPRESSOR WAS BURNED OUT AND MAKING A RATTLING NOISE.  I TOLD HIM THAT IT ALWAYS MADE THAT RATTLING NOISE.  HE STATED THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG BEFORE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MAKE THE NOISE NOW.  THIS COMPRESSOR WAS THE MOTOR THAT CONSTANTLY MADE NOISE FROM DAY ONE.  YET I WAS ALWAYS TOLD THAT NOTHING WAS WRONG.  IF NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH IT, THEN WHY IS IT SILENT NOW WHEN THE SUSPENSION SYSTEMS ACTIVATES.

WE WILL MAKE SURE THIS SCAM STOPS HERE AND NOW!!!!! YOU KNEW WHEN YOU DESIGNED THE FORD SUV VEHICLES THAT THE INTAKE VALVES WERE A PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!      MY HUSBAND AND I WENT TO ARKANSAS IN OUR 99 FORD EXPLORER. THE 2ND DAY WE ARRIVED THE VEHICLE STOPPED AT THE HOTEL.  IT WOULD NOT START. WE CONTACTED A FORD DEALERSHIP\u0019S SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND BEFORE I COULD EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON, THE SERVICEMAN INFORMED ME HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TE PROBLEM WAS. HE STATED THEY HAD SEVERAL VEHICLES IN THE SHOP PRIOR AND AT THAT TIME WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE SERVICE AREA, THERE WERE 7 INDIVIDUALS BESIDES MY HUSBAND AND I, WITH FORD EXPLORERS, WAITING TO HAVE THEIR VEHICLES REPAIRED DUE TO THE SAME PROBLEM, THE INTAKE VALVE. A COINCIDENCE???? I THINK NOT!!!!! THAT REPAIR COST MY HUSBAND AND I OVER $300.00.  THE SERVICEMAN EVEN INFORMED US HE WOULD NEVER BUY A FORD SUV AND HE WORKS FOR YOUR COMPANY!!!!!    MY BROTHER, ALFRED ANDERSON, WHO PURCHASED AN AMERICAN MADE VEHICLE FOR THE 1ST TIME IN 15 YEARS. MADE THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF HIS LIFE WHEN HE PURCHASED THE FORD EXPEDITION\u0013EDDIE BAUER. THE VEHICLE WAS PLACED IN THE SHOP LAST WEEK AND GUESS WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS, OH YEAH, THE INTAKE VALVE!!!! HE HAD TO PAY OVER $300.00 ALSO FOR A PROBLEM YOU KNEW ABOUT ALL ALONG!!!! NOT ONLY THAT, SEVERAL OF HIS CO-WORKERS, OF WHICH ARE STARTING A PETITION, PLACED THEIR FORD SUVS IN SERVICE FOR THE SAME EXACT ISSUE. MY BROTHER\u0019S SUV OVERHEATED YESTERDAY, WHICH COST HIM OVER $400.00 TO HAVE REPAIRED.  THIS IS YET ANOTHER WAY FORD IS MAKING MONEY FROM CUSTOMERS !!!!       THIS WILL NOT CONTINUE!!!

I HAVE DRIVEN FOR A LIVING SINCE THE EARLY 60'S AND THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS TODAY ON MANY FORD PRODUCTS THE SAME AS IT ALWAYS HAS. I HAVE PERSONALLY STOPPED AND TOLD MANY OF THOSE DRIVERS IN AN ATTEMPT TO PREVENT THEM FROM BEING REAR-ENDED DUE TO THE VEHICLE BEHIND THEM NOT BEING ALERTED TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE SLOWING/STOPPING. AT ONE TIME I WAS TOLD THAT THE PROBLEM WAS THE BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH LOCATET UNDER THE DASH THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO ACTIVATE THE BRAKE LIGHTS WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS PUSHED. I DO NOT KNOW IF ANY CORRECTIONS WERE EVER MADE TO THAT  PROBLEM BUT AS RECENTLY AS THIS WEEK I HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING A FORD THAT DID NOT HAVE WORKING BRAKE LIGHTS WHEN IT STOPPED IN FRONT OF ME. I AM RETIRED FROM THE BELL SYSTEM AND AS A REQUREMENT TO OPERATE A COMPANY MOTOR VEHICLE WE WERE GIVEN TRAINING ANNUALLY CALLED SMITH SYSTEM DEFENSIVE DRIVER TRAINING AND ALONG WITH ALL THE EXCELLENT SKILLS WE WERE TAUGHT WE WERE ALSO TOLD TO NOT FOLLOW A FORD WHENEVER POSSIBLE FOR THE OBVIOUS REASONS JUST STATED.

POSITION #3 IS SUPPOSED TO SHUT OFF ENGINE AND ALL ACCESSORIES WITHOUT LOCKING THE STEERING WHEEL.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT IT ALSO UNLOCKS THE BRAKE SHIFT INTERLOCK SAFTY MECHANISM THAT IS SUPPOSED TO PREVENT THE GEARSHIFT LEVER FROM BEING MOVED FROM P (PARK).  OUR 2 YEAR OLD SON WAS ABLE TO KNOCK THE GEARSHIFT LEVER DOWN 1 POSITION OUT OF PARK(REVERSE) AND THE CAR ROLLED FORWARD, DOWN A HILL AND INTO A POND, WTH HIM IN IT!  THE VEHICLE DOOR LOCKS AUTOMATICALLY LOCKED AS THE VEHICLE STARTED TO MOVE.  LUCKILY THE PASSANGER WINDOW OPENED WHEN THE VEHICLE WENT INTO THE WATER (MUST HAVE SHORTED OUT)  WE WERE ABLE TO RESCUE HIM BEFORE THE VEHICLE SANK (APPROX 1 MIN).  WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS REMOVED FROM THE WATER, THE GEARSHIFT LEVER WAS IN REVERSE POSITION AND THE IGNITION SWITCH WAS IN POSITION #3.  WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE BRAKE SHIFT INTERLOCK IS NOT ACTIVATED WHEN THE IGNITION SWITCH IS IN POSITION #3.      IS THERE A VALID REASON FOR THIS, OR IS IT AN OVERSIGHT IN THE DESIGN.  I HAVE SINCE TESTED THIS ON A 1997 EXPEDITION AND IT DOES THE SAME THING.  HAS THERE BEEN ANY OTHER REPORTED PROBLEMS WITH THIS?  WE CALLED FORD AND THEY SAID THAT THEY DO NOT DO THEIR OWN SAFETY TESTING AND THAT WE SHOULD CONTACT THE NHTSA.  WHAT SHOULD OUR NEXT COURSE OF ACTION BE?",
