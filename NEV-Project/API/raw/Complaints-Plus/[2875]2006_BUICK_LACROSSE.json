It is noted amongst internet discussion groups that General Motors/Buick has a common problem with a steering sensor/computer interface that causes this steering problem.  I have contacted dealerships, along with Buick's California \"response team\" with no solution. Everybody I've spoken to so far appears to be clueless about this problem which I suspect is not a truthful response from them.  The pulling has been going on for approximately 10 years, but my father (the original owner of this car) was already elderly at the time and had difficulty talking with people on the phone because of hearing loss. He let this fester.  This is a serious issue because of the consistent pulling that could lead to lane drifting and cause an accident.",

UPON MY RECOVERY, I RETURNED THE CAR TO THE DEALER FOR SERVICE ON APRIL 7, 2006.  ON APRIL 10, 2006, THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT CONTACTED AND INFORMED ME THAT MY CAR NEEDS A REPAIR TO THE CAMSHAFT ASSEMBLY. THIS DEFECT EXISTED THE DAY I PICKED UP THE CAR, IT HAD 87 MILES ON IT WHEN I PICKED IT UP, AND SINCE THE CAR WAS INSPECTED THE MORNING I PICKED IT UP, THE DEALER ALLOWED A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT TO BE SOLD AND DELIVERED. UPON CONTACTING BUICK TO MAKING BUICK IS AWARE THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED AND SEEKING RESOLUTION THE DEALER PUT A NEW ENGINE IN THE CAR.  IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THE DEALER OR BUICK TO SELL A DEFECTIVE CAR AND BELIEVE THAT PUTTING A NEW ENGINE IN THE CAR RESOLVES THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE COMPLAINT TO BUICK AND THE DEALER ABOUT THIS NUMEROUS TIME BUT I GET STONE WALLED, THEY COMPLETELY IGNORE THE PROBLEM EXISTING PRIOR TO ME BUYING AND TAKING DELIVERY OF THE CAR.  I HAVE ASKED FOR A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE, PARTIAL, OR TOTAL REFUND AND I'M IGNORED.  ALL BUICK DOES IS OFFER OIL CHANGES AND AN EXTENDED WARRANTY, WHICH I FIND USELESS. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ONSTAR MODULE FAILED, APRIL 22, 2006, AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.  *JB   UPDATED 07/16/2012   *JS    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

MY WIFE FIRST NOTICED IT ON A COLD MORNING, I HAD HER BOUNCE UP AND DOWN ON THE SEAT - NO RESPONSE. THE AIR-BAG REMAINED \"OFF.\" THIS HAPPENED EVERYTIME THE TEMPERATURE AS INDICATED ON THE DASH WAS 55 OF OR LOWER. ONLY AFTER THE HEATER WAS ON AND THE CABIN TEMPERATURE CAME CLOSER TO ROOM TEMPERATURE DID WE HEAR A \"CLICK!\" AND THE INDICATOR THEN SAID THE AIR-BAG WAS \"ON.\" IF THIS IS A DESIGN OR MANUFACTURING FLAW IN THESE SEAT SENSORS, THEN I CAN SEE THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS BEING POSSIBLY THROWN THROUGH THE FRONT WINDSHIELD BECAUSE \"THE COMPUTER\" \"KNOWS\" THAT NO ONE IS SITTING IN THE FRONT SEAT AND HAS THEREFORE TURNED THE AIR-BAG \"OFF.\" THIS OCCURRED AT LEAST 5 TIMES IN JANUARY WHEN WE WERE IN VIRGINIA THE FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY. HAVE REFERRED THIS TO THE DEALER AND WROTE A TWO PAGE LETTER TO THE OWNER; THE SERVICE MANAGER SAYS THAT \"THAT'S THE WAY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO WORK.\" MY WIFE AND I ARE SKEPTICAL.  *JB",
