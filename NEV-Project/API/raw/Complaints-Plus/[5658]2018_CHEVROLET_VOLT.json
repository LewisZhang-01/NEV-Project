My car is repaired but according to the internet there is a class action lawsuit over this very thing in Texas filed SEVERAL years ago.

Gear shifters have been in cars since they were first invented.  This should be a recall and GM forced to create a new shifter and replace the old ones.  This is NOT a new technology.
