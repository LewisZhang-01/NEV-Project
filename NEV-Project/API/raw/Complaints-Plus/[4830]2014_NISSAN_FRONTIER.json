WHEN SAFELY AT HOME, OPEN HOOD TO SEE IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM. THE WHITE PLASTIC RETAINING RING THAT HOLDS THE HEADLIGHT BULB (9007) IN THE HEADLIGHT HOUSING WAS OFF AND HANGING ON THE WIRES, AND THE HEADLIGHT BULB WAS STARTING THE COME OUT OF THE HEADLIGHT HOUSING.     AFTER TALKING TO THE DEALERSHIP, THEY COMPARED THE RETAINING RING TO THREE OTHER NEW, NEVER SOLD BEFORE FRONTIERS AND FOUND THIS WAS A STANDARD PART. THE RING DOES NOT MAKE A FULL 1/4 TURN TO TIGHTEN AND THE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE / FORCE TO TIGHTEN RETAINING RING EQUALED TO ALMOST NOTHING. UNKNOWN IF THIS WILL BE A CONSTANT ISSUE IN MY FUTURE OWNERSHIP OF THIS VEHICLE, BUT SINCE THIS WAS  AN ISSUE ON EVERY FRONTIER ON THIS LOT, EVEN THOUGH THEY OFFERED TO REPLACE THE RING, NOTHING WOULD BE RESOLVED, IT'S AN IDENTICAL RING.    A) UNKNOWN IF THIS WILL CONSTANTLY COME UNDONE ALLOWING THE BULB TO LOOSEN AND FALL OUT.  B) IF THIS CONTINUES TO COME UNDONE, WATER / MOISTURE ? DIRT CAN CONSTANTLY ENTER THE HEADLIGHT HOUSING.  C) IF BULB FALLS OUT AND IN USE THE HOT BULB CAN / COULD MELT THE HEADLIGHT UNIT, OR FALL ON WIRES MELTING THE MATERIAL CAUSING ELECTRICAL ISSUE.  D) CONTACTED NISSAN CORPORATE WITH ANOTHER ISSUE AND THE RESPONSE WAS THEY PREFER TO HAVE THE DEALERSHIP HANDLE VEHICLE CONCERNS. SO DON'T KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH NISSAN THEY HAVE A POOR PRODUCT DESIGN / POSSIBLE SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD CONSIDER REDESIGN OF NOTHING ELSE, THE WHITE RETAINING RING.
