TWO WEEKS LATER, THE CAR GAVE ME AN ENGINE WARNING YELLOW LIGHT. IT RESULTED TO BE THAT THE INTAKE VANOS MODULE FAILED. THEY DID A ROAD TEST THIS TIME TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS WORKING ACCORDINGLY.     WHEN I WAS DRIVING BACK HOME I NOTICED A HEAVY WHITE SMOKE COMING FROM THE ENGINE BAY, AND A BURNING SMELL. I IMMEDIATELY STOPPED THE VEHICLE. FOR MY FORTUNE IT WASN'T A FIRE, IT WAS JUST BURNING OIL.

I COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS 1 MONTH AGO, AND WAS TOLD THAT THE BATTERY WAS IN PERFECT SHAPE.
