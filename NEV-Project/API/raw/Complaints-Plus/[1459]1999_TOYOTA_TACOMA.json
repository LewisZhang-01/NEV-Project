A FEW DAYS EARLIER I HAD WONDERED WHY THE BED WAS TILTED UP PINCHING THE BACK OF THE CAB.   THE VEHICLE HAD PASSED STATE INSPECTION YEAR AFTER YEAR AND HAD BEEN SEE BY MY REGULAR MECHANIC LESS THAN 2 YEARS AGO AND NO ISSUES WITH FRAME DETERIORATION WERE FOUND OR BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION.    I CONTACTED TOYOTA AND JUST YESTERDAY WAS TOLD, SORRY ABOUT YOUR \"RUST\" ISSUE, BUT  THE WARRANTY HAS LONG EXPIRED.   THIS IS A WELL DOCUMENTED DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING DEFECT TIED TO IMPROPER PREP BY TOYOTA FRAME CONTRACTOR DANA HOLDING CORP.     THE VEHICLE WAS FULLY OPERATIONAL AND NOW IT IS UN-DRIVEABLE.    IF THE VEHICLE HAD COME APART AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS,  IT COULD HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS INJURY OR FATALITY.     THIS IS MY ONLY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION AS A FIXED INCOME RETIREE.  THERE'S NO JUSTIFIABLE REASON A VEHICLE FRAME SHOULD FAIL LIKE THIS ONLY TO HAVE TOYOTA TELL ME THEY WILL DO NOTHING.     MY TROUBLES ASIDE, THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PUBLIC SAFETY RISK AND A RISK TO ALL SERVICE PERSONNEL, OWNERS, THEIR PASSENGERS AND OTHERS ON THE ROAD IN THEIR VICINITY.     IT WAS ONLY BY SHEER LUCK THAT I DISCOVERED THIS WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED.",

THE WHOLE FRAME, IF THEY LOCATE ONE USED FROM OUT WEST AND REPAIR WOULD BE $6000.  IT REALLY SEEMS THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE HERE AND THERE HASN'T BEEN A RECALL ON THE FRAME.

I WAS SENT BACK ON THE ROAD TO DEAL WITH THE FRAME MYSELF AND I IMMEDIATELY WROTE TWO LETTER PLEADING THE MANUFACTURER FOR ANOTHER INSPECTION AT ANOTHER DEALER. I WAS DENIED THAT REQUEST. MEANWHILE, TWO INDEPENDENT MECHANICS ADVISED ME NOT TO DRIVE IT. I MOSTLY PARK THE TRUCK IN MY DRIVEWAY AND TRIED NOT TO THINK ABOUT THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS AND INSURANCE THAT CONTINUE. THE REGISTRATION EXPIRED IN MY DRIVEWAY AND I DID NOT RENEW IT UNTIL THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION RULES REQUIRED IT. ON 10/13/10, I DROVE MY TRUCK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND IT WAS INSPECTED AGAIN. I WAS TOLD THE CORPORATION WOULD BUY IT BACK UNDER THE RECALL. THIS TIME THERE COULD BE NO MISTAKE WITH PICTURED, BECAUSE THIS TIME HOLES EXISTED AND THERE WAS NO STEEL LEFT IN THE AREAS. MY TRUCK REMAINS AT THE DEALERSHIP AND MAYBE THE NHTSA SHOULD INSPECT IT TO SEE HOW A VEHICLE HAS TO BE BEFORE THE CORPORATION WILL DO ANYTHING.     UPDATED 01/20/11 *BF",

UPON REMOVING THE BOX, THE GAS TANK HE NOTICED HE HAD OPENED A MAJOR CAN OF WORMS. BOTH SIDES OF THE TRUCKS FRAME WERE SHOT FROM THE FRONT OF THE CAB TO THE BACK BUMPER. HE IMMEDIATELY CALLED ME WITH THIS PROBLEM.

THE GENERAL MANAGER JOHN PANKO SAID HIMSELF THAT THIS VEHICLE IS NOT ROAD WORTHY. WELL A LONG STORY SHORT... TOYOTA CORP WAS CALLED IN TO INSPECT THIS VEHICLE AND OFFERED TO GIVE ME $2000.00 TO FIX IT. A SERVICE MANAGER SAID IT WOULD COST ABOUT $6000.00 TO FIX. WELL NEEDLES TO SAY I AM NOT PAYING ANOTHER 4K ON A VEHICLE THAT I ALREADY OWE $11,500.00 ON. I HAVE NO WARRANTY LEFT TO DATE ON THIS VEHICLE, AND EVEN IF I DID, THE FRAME WOULD NOT BE COVERED. THE ALEXANDER DEALERSHIP WOULD NOT GIVE ME A LOANER CAR, OR HELP ME IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. THEY HAVE GIVEN ME THE RUN AROUND LONG ENOUGH.

I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE LONG TERM EFFECT OF WEAR AND TEAR ON THE LOWER SPINE FROM CONTINUAL CONTACT WITH THESE RODS CAUSES SERIOUS PROBLEMS.  THESE RODS ARE PLACED PERPINDICULAR TO THE DRIVERS SPINAL COLUMN AND ARE MOUNTED HORIZONTALLY ON THE FORWARD PART OF THE SEAT FRAME.  THEY ARE PADDED ONLY BY SEAT COVER MATERIAL AND LOW DENSITY FOAM.  I BELIEVE THAT THE ADDITIONAL SEAT WIDTH OF THE DRIVERS SIDE OF THE 60/40 SEAT ACCENTUATES THE EFFECT OF THE PRESSURE ON THE SPINE AS OPPOSED TO A REGULAR \"BUCKET\" SEAT.  ADDITIONALLY THE \"MIDDLE\" SEAT POSITION HAS SEAT BELT CONNECTORS WHICH ALLOW FOR A SEATING SPACE OF ONLY 7.5 INCHES HORIZONTALLY.  NO ADULT COULD POSSIBLY FIT IN THE SPACE, THE SEAT POSITION IS USELESS BUT COULD ENCOURAGE SOMEONE TO SEAT A CHILD IN IT WITH DEADLY RESULTS. *AK",

SHE CALLED A GOODYEAR DEALER IN DALTON  AND TALKED WITH MATT ACKLEN STORE MANAGER AT GOODYEAR BRYMAN'S PLAZA NORTH.  HE WAS  VERY HELPFUL AND TOLD ME THE WHEEL WAS THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM NOT THE TIRE.  I WENT BACK TO TOYOTA ON 4/21/2000 AND JESSE  STATED IT WAS THE TIRE AND GOODYEAR SHOULD STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT.  I HAVE GOTTEN NOWHERE WITH EITHER COMPANY AND AM VERY FRUSTRATED.

I LOCKED UP MY BRAKES, BUT THE ROAD HAD BEEN SANDED FOR ICE THE NIGHT BEFORE.  I BROADSIDED HER AT A SPEED OF AT LEAST 35 MPH.  MY VEHICLE WAS A TOTALED. HER VEHICLE WAS ALSO TOTALED. SHE WAS AIR LIFTED TO A HOSPITAL.  NONE OF THE EMERGENCY WORKERS COULD UNDERSTAND WHY MY AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.  BOTH AUTO BODY PLACES, AND A MASTER MECHANIC SAID THEY SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED.  A 1999 TOYOTA SAT NEXT TO MINE IN THE REPAIR FACILITY WITH SEVERE FRONT END DAMAGE AND HIS DID NOT DEPLOY.  I HAVE PICTURES OF MY VEHICLE, MRS. KEEVY'S VEHICLE, AND THE OTHER TOYOTA.  I HAVE ALSO ORDERED A POLICE REPORT.  I NOTIFIED TOYOTA ON THEIR HOTLINE, THEY SENT AN INVESTIGATOR WHO SAID I DID NOT MEET THE CRITERIA.  I SENT THEM TWO CERTIFIED LETTERS, ONE WITH PICTURES OF ALL VEHICLES.  THEY FINALLY CONTACTED LAST WEEK, REQUESTING A POLICE REPORT AND HOSPITAL RECORDS.  *AK",
