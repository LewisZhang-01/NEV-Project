I was thrown down an embankment and into a cornfield where my vehicle came to a stop. I narrowly missed a telephone pole and culvert. I am extremely fortunate that my car went into a field rather than into oncoming traffic as this happened during rush hour traffic on a Thursday night around 5-530pm. I\u2019m glad that I was able to walk away from this and wasn\u2019t killed. I had no warning lights, no laxity in steering, no warning at all-absolutely NOTHING that would\u2019ve allowed me time to avoid this. The part failure has been recalled previously, and when I called Subaru I was told that the recall had been \u201ctaken care of\u201d which concerns me that this part was \u201cfixed\u201d and still put my life in danger. Police were called to the scene and a report was written. My car was towed to a local shop to be evaluated and was considered a total loss due to the extent of the damage. I am still waiting to hear back from Subaru if there is anything they are willing or wanting to do. I don\u2019t want this to happen to anyone else. I take amazing care of my vehicles, and haven\u2019t even owned this car for a year. Now I am stuck in a completely unfair situation and having to carry the financial burden for something I was not responsible for. The vehicle is still available to be looked at as well, and I am more than happy to have someone look at the damage. I don\u2019t want anyone to lose their life over this part malfunction, and I hope you are able to help me do something about this to keep everyone on the road safe.",

HOWEVER, THE BOWSER SUBARU GARAGE FAILED TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATION CAUSE THEY FAILED TO REPLACE THE RUSTED OUT PARTS AND THEY ARGUED IT WAS FINE AFTER THEY DID A SPRING TENSION TEST BY HITTING ONLY ONE AREA- THE THICKEST PART OF THE METAL AND THEY REFUSED TO CHECK ANY OTHER SPOT. MY SIGNIFICANT OTHER, WHO HAS EXPERIENCE IN AUTO MECHANICS AFTER HAVING BEEN A MECHANIC IN THE SERVICE, KNEW THIS BOWSER SUBARU WAS WRONG SO HE WENT ACROSS THE STREET TO FIRESTONE, OBTAINED EVIDENCE/PROOF WITH DOCUMENTATION FROM FIRESTONE AFTER THEY CHECKED THE FRONT LOWER CONTROL ARMS AND THEY NOTED \"BOTH\" LOWER FRONT CONTROL ARMS NEEDED REPLACED BUT \"AGAIN\" EVEN WITH THIS PROOF, THIS BOWSER SUBARU GARAGE IGNORED THIS \"SAFETY\" RECALL ISSUE AND THEY SAID THEY WANTED $2,000 TO FIX IT WHEN IT WAS STILL UNDER THIS RECALL IN 2011. SUBARU HEADQUARTERS CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID THE RECALL WAS COMPLETED ON THIS VEHICLE IN 2011 AND THEY REFUSE TO FIX THIS RECALL. HOWEVER, THIS CAR STILL HAS THE ORIGINAL PARTS THAT SUBARU NEVER CORRECTED AND FORTUNATELY IT LASTED THIS LONG HOWEVER, THEY FINALLY BROKE FROM THE RUST. FORTUNATELY, WE GOT OFF THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY SAFELY-ONLY 2 MILES AWAY AND ALSO MADE IT TO THE BOTTOM OF A STEEP HILL SAFELY BEFORE HAVING IT TOWED. SUBARU NEVER FULFILLED THEIR OBLIGATION AND DENIED THIS RECALL BY COVERING IT UP THAT THEY COMPLETED THE WORK WHEN THEY NEVER DID ANYTHING. I WILL SUBMIT ANY DOCUMENTATION THAT YOU REQUEST.",

WE IMMEDIATELY DECIDED TO TAKE CAR TO THE DEALER, SINCE THE FUMES WHERE SO OVERWHELMING WE DROVE WITH THE WINDOWS OPEN. LUCKY FOR US THE DEALER IS A 15 MINUTES RIDE, BUT WITH THE WINDOWS DOWN AND NO HEAT TO MINIMIZE THE SITUATION AND THE WEATHER BELOW 20 DEGREES IS KIND OF HARD. WE FINALLY MADE IT TO THE DEALER. THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN TOLD US THAT WHEN THE WEATHER IS BELOW 30 DEGREES THE FUEL LINES SHRINK, CAUSING FUEL TO LEAK. I WAS TAKEN BACK TO KNOW THIS KIND OF HAZARD WAS NOT RECALL BY THE MANUFACTURER AND THAT OTHER FOLKS ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM ON THEIR SUBARU FORESTER. I FURTHER LEARNED THE REPAIRS WERE ESTIMATED AT OVER $1,300.00, BECAUSE THEY NEEDED TO REPLACE ALL THE FUEL LINES IN ORDER TO STOP THE LEAK.  IT SEEMS THIS IS ISSUE HAPPEN TO VEHICLES FROM 2000-2003 BASED ON RECALL (SUBARU RECALL NO. WVK-21IT). I BELIEVE THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE FATAL.

THE DEALER SAID THAT THE FUEL LINES SHRINK DUE TO THE COLD BELOW 30 DEGREE'S THUS LEAKING RAW FUEL WHENEVER THE VEHICLE IS RUNING.  AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD THAT NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED BY YOUR AGENCY BEFORE IT TURNS INTO A FATALITY.  FURTHERMORE, IT SEEM THAT PREVIOUS SUBARU MODELS HAD THIS ISSUE AND A RECALL WAS ISSUED  (SUBARU RECALL NO.

WE WERE TOLD THAT THE FORESTER NOW NEEDS AN ENGINE REBUILD SINCE LOWER ENGINE MAIN BEARING HAD FAILED, CAUSING RESIDUAL SCORING DAMAGE TO THE CYLINDER BLOCK AND BOTH CYLINDER HEADS.

WHEN THE CAR IS STARTED, MAYBE SIX TIMES IN THE FOUR MONTHS I HAVE HAD THE CAR, IT IMMEDIATELY LURCHES INTO FULL SPEED THE SECOND THE ACCELERATOR IS TOUCHED, AND SENDS YOU TWENTY OR MORE FEET FORWARD (ONCE BACKWARDS) BEFORE YOU CAN POSSIBLY BRAKE.    I HAVE NARROWLY AVOIDED SEVERAL POTENTIALLY FATAL ACCIDENTS.  TODAY I HAD A REAL ACCIDENT.  WHEN I WENT INTO CARTER SUBARU THIS MORNING, THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN TO ME.  TOLD ME THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING EVER HAPPENING TO A SUBARU, THAT SOMETHING THAT ONLY HAPPENED ONCE A MONTH WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO CHECK. THE MANAGER BASICALLY CALLED ME A LIAR AND ASKED ME TO LEAVE.    IT ISN'T JUST THIS ACCIDENT, THE CAR CAN BE REPAIRED, BUT THIS IS A CAR DEFECT THAT CAN CERTAINLY KILL SOMEONE.  ON AT LEAST TWO OCCASIONS, ONCE IN GROCERY LOT AND ONCE LEAVING MY DRIVEWAY, IT WAS ONLY BY CHANCE I DIDN'T HIT A PEDESTRIAN.    I FEEL THE CAR IS UNSAFE AND SHOULDN'T BE DRIVEN, BUT EVEN MORE DISTURBING IS SUBARU'S ATTITUDE THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE, AND THAT I AM A LIAR.    BRUCE MCALISTER",
