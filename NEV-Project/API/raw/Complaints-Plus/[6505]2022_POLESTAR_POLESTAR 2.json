Dealership advised me that the new breaking system can be disabled manually on a \"drive - by - drive\" basis. This is dangerous because the auto must be in reverse gear to activate the time consuming 2 step disable process and operator must remember to disable during every use.

This appears to happen in wet climates, after its driven in the rain, after the wheels are cleaned with water, or stored in a humid space. Typical symptoms are: (a) the morning after the pads are exposed to water or excessive humidity, the brakes makes a loud THUD noise when initially moving it out of standstill; (b) it then proceeds with a low-pitched grinding noise coming from the wheels, and then goes away after a few seconds.If the grinding noise persists, turns into a sound similar to having a flat tire, and eventually turning into a repetitive judder noise when either applying the brakes or quickly releasing the accelerator when OPD, there's a good chance you have this issue.  Cause: A high percentage of the brake pads' material consists of metal with an outer metal coating that helps with break in and corrosion. These pads create significantly more brake dust, which coats the rotors while driving. The metal in the dust adheres the pads to the rotors, especially when wet. The leftover thumping noise is brake pad material that broke off and remained on the rotor. It's possible the parking brake uses the same rear brakes. In this scenario, the brakes are essentially applied overnight, which further exacerbates the pad bonding to the rotors. At this moment, it's not possible to park your car without applying the parking brake.",

I live in the Northeast US where the weather gets very cold and we get a lot of snow. I looked at my window sticker and it doesn't say anything about summer tires. I'm surprised that Polestar / Volvo negligently put summer tires on a NON-performance model and did not inform customers like me in snowy regions - this is very dangerous! Polestar really needs to either provide all season tires as standard in snowy regions or proactively inform customers that their cars are equipped with summer tires.   The only reason I found out my Polestar came with summer tires is from a Facebook post where a driver got into an accident in the snow with his brand new Polestar not knowing it had summer tires on. There are a lot of facebook posts with Polestar drivers unknowingly driving their Polestars in the snow with summer tires. This is very dangerous!",
