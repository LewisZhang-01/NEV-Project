I, in fact, had the auxiliary pump that mini came up with replaced and the power steering problem continued because their fix was no good. I have an appointment with the Mini Cooper dealership to look at my car in about 2 weeks.  They've told me that I'm not covered by the recall even though they ordered a recall of 86,000 cars for the problem in 2015.  Not having power steering in any vehicle is very dangerous.

I ALREADY KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG.  OBSERVED A LEAK IN THE POWER STEERING RESERVOIR.  DEALER SUPPOSEDLY FIXED THE PROBLEM BY REPLACING SOME HOSES. AFTER A MONTH, I TRIED STARTING THE CAR UP AND THE CAR WOULD NOT START.  I WAS LUCKY TO STILL BE AT HOME THAT TIME. RECHARGED THE BATTERY AND STARTED THE CAR.  TURNED THE ENGINE OFF AND NOTICED A SOUND.  TRACED THE SOUND TO THE POWER STEERING PUMP NOT TURNING OFF EVEN IF THE ENGINE IS TURNED OFF. DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY SO IT WILL NOT DO A FULL DISCHARGE.  BOUGHT IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT I PURCHASED IT FROM AND THEY CONFIRMED THAT THE ISSUE WAS WITH THE PS PUMP. DID RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS A COMMON ISSUE RELATED TO THIS PUMP ALREADY AND BMW HAS OFFERED EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE PUMP AND PERIPHERALS LIKE HOSES AND RESERVOIR COVERING 2003 TO 2005 MODELS DUE TO THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS AND POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC ISSUES A FAILED PUMP CAN BRING. I ASKED THE LOCAL BMW SERVICE CENTER IF I COULD AVAIL BUT THEY SAID MY VIN WAS NOT PART OF THE COVERAGE. I NEEDED THE CAR TO WORK AND I WANTED IT DONE RIGHT SO I HAD THEM REPLACE THE PUMP.  THIS COSTED ME 1500 CAD++ I BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOULD STILL BE COVERED BY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY BECAUSE THE SYMPTOMS ARE THE SAME AND THAT THE PUMP IS CONFIRMED TO BE AN ORIGINAL BY THE MINI SERVICE AND MAY VERY WELL STILL BE THE SAME ONE FROM THE PREVIOUS MODELS AND BMW SHOULD OWN UP TO THIS.",

FAST FORWARD TO 2015 WITH RECALL BUT UNABLE TO EXECUTE THE RECALL DUE TO LACK OF PARTS.      NHTSA SHOULD INVESTIGATE WHAT THE CAUSE OF DELAY AND SINCE THE ORIGINAL PART WORKS ALBEIT BAD DURABILITY, FORCE MINI COOPER/BMW TO PERFORM STOP GAP REPAIRS WITH OLDER PARTS, BYPASS SENSOR OR CHANGE SOFTWARE CODE TO DISREGARD BAD SENSOR INPUT.

STOP GAP REPAIRS, INCLUDING CHANGING THE SOFTWARE CODE AND ELIMINATE SENSOR INPUT TO DISABLE THE AIRBAG CAN BE A TEMPORARY REPAIR.    HOW HARD IS IT FOR BMWQ TO SHORT OR \"FAKE\" THE SENSOR SIGNAL, SO THE SYSTEM WOULD NOT DISABLE THE AIRBAG; HENCE IT WOULD DEPLOY WHEN THERE'S A PASSENGER ONBOARD.  PUT A STICKER ON THE DASHBOARD THAT SAYS AIRBAGS ARE TEMPORARY ACTIVE AND CHILD SEATS NOT ALLOWED.  MY SAFETY INSTINCT TELLS ME IT IS PREFERRED TO HAVE THE AIRBAG ACTIVE AND DEPLOY WHEN NEEDED.

ABOUT A YEAR AGO, I NOTICED THAT AFTER SLOWING BY STEPPING OFF / RELEASING THE GAS PEDAL, THE CAR WOULD JERK FORWARD - AT THE TIME, I DID NOT THINK IT WAS SERIOUS BECAUSE IT HAPPENED A FEW TIME AND IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. AFTER LAST MINI SERVICE IN MARCH 2015 - LATELY, I NOTICED THAT IN STOP & GO TRAFFIC, SOMETIMES AFTER BRAKING OR SLOWING, THE CAR HAS A HARD TIME GETTING UP TO SPEED - SOMETIMES GRADUALLY STEPPING ON GAS PEDAL AS USUAL TO START OFF AGAIN, I HEAR THE ENGINE REV UP PRETTY LOUD SO I LET UP ON THE GAS PEDAL, AND THEN TRY TO STEP ON GRADUALLY AGAIN - SOMETIMES, IT WOULD TAKE A WHILE FOR THE CAR TO GET UP TO SPEED.  ALSO, LATELY, AFTER I BRAKE AND SWITCH FROM DRIVE TO REVERSE TO BACK INTO THE DRIVEWAY, THE CAR JERKS BACK WHEN I AM NOT STEPPING ON THE GAS PEDAL AT ALL.  I TOLD THE MINI DEALER ABOUT THIS LAST WEEK WHEN THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT START - THE DEALER FOUND THAT THE CAR DID NOT START DUE TO FAULTY CIRCUITRY IN A FUSE BOX, WHICH WAS REPLACED WITH A NEW FUSE BOX.  THE DEALER SAID THAT WHAT I DESCRIBED SOUNDED LIKE A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM, AND AFTER THE NEW FUSE BOX WAS PUT IN, THE DEALER TOOK THE CAR ON A TEST DRIVE TO SEE IF ANYTHING ELSE WAS WRONG.  THE DEALERS DIAGNOSIS WAS TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION AT A COST OF $9,000.  MY CAR HAS AROUND 55,000 MILES AND HAS BEEN MAINTAINED WELL.  IT IS UNREASONABLE FOR THE TRANSMISSION TO REQUIRE REPLACEMENT AT SUCH LOW MILEAGE AND IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME - THE CAR WAS BARELY USED IN THE FIRST YEAR - IT WAS DRIVEN MOSTLY WITHIN THE LAST 7-8 YEARS.

WHEN I TALKED TO THE DEALERSHIP, THEY INDICATED THAT THEY HAVE SEEN ABOUT 2 TO 3 CARS HAVING PROBLEM (JUST WITHIN THAT DEALERSHIP) IN RECENT TIMES (THE PERSON I TALKED TO WAS RELATIVELY NEW).     IT IS UNREASONABLE FOR TRANSMISSION TO REQUIRE A REPLACEMENT AT SUCH LOW MILEAGE. IN ADDITION, IT LOOKS LIKE THIS SEEMS LIKE A SYSTEMIC ISSUE GIVEN JUST ONE DEALER HAS SEEN A FEW OF THESE AND A QUICK SEARCH INDICATES A NUMBER OF OTHER OWNERS OF MINI COOPER S ENCOUNTERING THIS ISSUE OVER LAST 12 TO 18 MONTHS (TRANSLATES TO TRANSMISSION SYSTEMATICALLY BREAKING AFTER ABOUT 7 TO 8 YEARS OF OPERATION).     THE PROBLEM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RESULT IN COLLISIONS SINCE THE CAR WILL NOT ACCELERATE AS EXPECTED.   *TR",

NO ONE COULD EXPLAIN IT. AFTER THE APRIL INCIDENT I WENT TO THE MINI COOPER DEALER AND SPENT CLOSE TO $3000 TO ENSURE THAT THE CAR WAS SAFE FOR MY CHILDREN. HOWEVER, YESTERDAY, 11/5/13, I WAS BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT AND THE CAR COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP FOR ASSISTANCE AND THEY SAID THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS KIND OF PROBLEM AND COULDN'T HELP; FORTUNATELY THE CAR RESTARTED ABOUT TEN MINUTES LATER. HOWEVER, I AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED THAT THIS CAR IS UNSAFE AND I HAVE HEARD FROM AN ACQUAINTANCE WHO ALSO HAS A MINI COOPER S 2006 WHO SAID THIS HAS HAPPENED TO HER, THAT SOMETHING RANDOM HAPPENED WITH HER CAR AND IT COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN WHILE SHE WAS DRIVING. SHE TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS A RECALL, BUT I CALLED MINI CORPORATE TODAY, AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO RECALL AND REFERRED ME TO NHTSA.  *TR",

I CONTACTED MINI USA TO FILE A COMPLAINT BECAUSE I THOUGHT AT THIS MILEAGE AND SAFETY ISSUE THE REPAIR SHOULD BE COVERED AS WARRANTY (RECALL).  THEY DENIED THE REQUEST AND ALSO INDICATED THE SYSTEM WOULD STILL DEPLOY IN AN ACCIDENT. AFTER READING SEVERAL BLOGS, EVERYONE SEEMS TO INDICATE THE BAGS WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY.

THE WEATHER IS ACTUALLY UNSEASONABLY COOL (60-70 DEGREE F), AND I HAD BEEN CHANGING GEARS (I HAVE THE AUTOMATIC WITH SPORTS DRIVE). SO NATURALLY, WHEN I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE THE COOLING FAN CAME ON AGAIN AND DIDN'T TURN OFF FOR ANOTHER 3-5 MINUTES. SO ON THE WAY BACK, I DROVE AT ABOUT 30 MILES WITH MY HAZARD LIGHT ON AS I WAS DRIVING ON THE FREE-WAY AND PUT IT ON CRUISE CONTROL. BUT THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE STILL WENT UP TO ABOUT 3 QUARTERS OF THE WAY AND THE FAN KICKED ON AFTER I PARKED IT AFTER ABOUT 15 MINUTES. THE MANUAL SAYS TO IMMEDIATELY STOP THE CAR AND LET THE ENGINE COOL DOWN IF THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE GOES PAST THE HALF-WAY POINT. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALER IN 2 DAYS FOR WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A COOLING FAN PROBLEM. BUT THIS SEEMS LIKE AN ENGINE ISSUE.

I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER TO CHECK A COUPLE OF THINGS INCLUDING THIS ONE AND THEY IGNORED IT A COUPLE OF TIMES SAYING IT WAS OK.  MY BIG SURPRISE WAS YESTERDAY WHEN AFTER HAVING TO LEAVE THE CAR THE WHOLE DAY, THEY TOLD ME THAT THE CAR HAS ANOTHER ISSUE NAMED \"MUSHROOMING\". THIS IS WHEN THE CAR GOT A HARD HIT AND THE STRUT TOWER PUSHES UP THE METAL WHERE IS ATTACHED TO CREATING A BUBBLE AND DAMAGING THE ALIGNMENT.  HOW CAN THE STRUT TOWER MAKES THIS DAMAGE WITHOUT DAMAGING THE RIM FIRST?... ALL MY RIMS ARE OK, NO BENDS. INITIALLY THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME ALMOST $1700 TO FIX THE WHOLE ISSUE. I SPOKE DIRECTLY WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER AND HE TOLD ME THAT AS A GOODWILL GESTURE THEY WOULD REPLACE THE STRUT TOWER, FIX THE PROBLEM AND GIVE ME TWO NEW TIRES, BUT IN EXCHANGE I'D HAVE TO BUY THEM THE TWO REAR TIRES FOR MY CAR FOR A PRICE OF $223.00 PLUS EXTRAS... THIS SOUNDS TO ME LIKE BRIBE... I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH ABOUT THIS \"MUSHROOMING\" ISSUE AND I'VE FOUND THAT IS A FACTORY DEFECT THAT HAS TO BE FIXED WITH AFTERMARKET PIECES AS A \"REINFORCEMENT PLATE\" AND/OR \"STRUT TOWER BRACE\". THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE METAL PIECE THAT HOLDS THE STRUT TOWER TO THE CAR IS TOO WEAK, SO THE METAL WOULD BEND SO EASY. THIS ISSUE CAN BE FOUND VERY CLEAR IN FORUMS AS WWW.NORTHAMERICANMOTORING.COM AND \"WWW.SUNSHINEMINIS.ORG\"; JUST SEARCH FOR \"MUSHROOM\". MINI WARRANTY DOESN'T COVER ANY PROBLEM RELATED TO HITS. I BELIEVE THEY KNOW ABOUT THE ISSUE AND THAT IS WHY THEY TRY TO IGNORE IT ALL THE TIME TELLING THE OWNERS THAT THE WARRANTY DON'T COVER THAT, BUT BEING A FACTORY'S DEFECT THEY HAVE TO FIX IT RIGHT AWAY AT NO CHARGE.  *TR",
