IN 11/2001, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON  3 TIMES.  AT THIS POINT, THE VEHICLE WAS ALSO DUE FOR EMISSIONS TESTING AND DID NOT PASS THE TEST BECAUSE OF A CYLINDER MISFIRE CODE.  ONCE I WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN THE FUNDS FOR REPAIR, IN 5/2004 @ 118,668 MILES, I DECIDED TO TAKE THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE REPAIRS. I WAS TOLD THAT I NEEDED TO HAVE THE  SPARK PLUGS REPLACED AND THAT WOULD SOLVE THE ISSUE.  SO I PAID $114.24 TO REPLACE THE 6 .SPARK PLUGS, PROBLEM NOT SOLVED I ENDED UP PAYING $3,758.82 IN 7/2005  TO REPLACE CYLINDER HEADS, TIMING BELT, AND WATER PUMP . THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME I HAD THE TIMING BELT REPLACED.  RECENTLY, IN 3/2006, OIL LIGHT CAME ON. HAD TO REPLACE BOTH VC GASKETS, CAM PLUGS, BOTH FT CAM SEALS AND REAR CAM SEALS AND TIMING BELT ONCE AGAIN FOR THIRD TIME. THIS COST TO ME WAS $2,677.50.  NOW THE OIL LIGHT IS BACK ON AGAIN.  *NM",

I WAS ALMOST IN AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE I COULD NOT STEER. THE BELT WAS REPLACED.  SIX WEEKS LATER, AGAIN-IN COLD AND RAINY WEATHER.  IT HAPPENED AGAIN, AND TODAY, 3 WEEKS LATER, YES, COLD AND RAINY WEATHER  IT HAS HAPPENED FOR A THIRD TIME.  MY GARAGE IS SET TO REPLACE THE STEERING FLUID PUMP, THINKING IT MIGHT BE LEAKING ON IT,   THE BELT, TENSIONER AND A PULLEY.  HOPING IT WILL FIX THE PROBLEM, THIS WILL BE A $500 BILL AT LEAST.  HOWEVER, AFTER MUCH RESEARCH I HAVE FOUND THIS TO BE A REGULAR PROBLEM FOR THIS MAKE AND MODEL,  CROSSING SEVERAL MODEL YEARS. I CONTACTED DODGE, WHO TOLD ME THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT WITHOUT A RECALL, BUT AGREED THERE HAVE BEEN  TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS  (TSBS) REGARDING THE PROBLEM.  I TOLD THEM I DID RESEARCH  ON THESE TSBS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS WEBSITES WHERE AUTO MECHANICS POST, AND THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SINGLE REPAIR THAT WORKS IN EACH VEHICLE.  THIS SHOULD BE A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN.  THIS BELT CONTROLS THE STEERING, THE ALTERNATOR AND THE FANS.  THIS IS A MINI-VAN, MADE FOR FAMILIES.  I AM FEARFUL OF ALLOWING MY THREE CHILDREN TO RIDE IN THIS VEHICLE NOW, KNOWING  THAT EVEN AFTER THE REPAIRS COMING UP THIS WEEK, THE PROBLEM MAY NOT BE FIXED.

AFTER 30KMILES, I TOOK IT IN TO A MECHANIC.  IN HIS EXPERIENCE, THE DEALER EQUIPPED FRONT DISC \"PISTONS MADE OF PHEOLIC MATERIAL\" WOULD OFTEN 'STICK'.. AFTER REPLACING W/ \"STEEL\" PISTONS THIS PROBLEM WAS REPAIRED.    2) THE PROBLEMATIC 'CLOCK-SPRING' FAILED RIGHT BEFORE I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE!  BUT, AFTER 30K MORE MILES, IT FAILED AGAIN... THIS TIME THE DEALER REFUSED TO REPAIR IT FREE. OF COURSE THE \"LEGALLY REQUIRED HORN\"  IS ALSO NO-FUNCTIONING.     3) THE POWER LOCKS FIGHT ME WHEN OPENING WITH A KEY.  ON REMOVING SAID KEY, THEY THEN 'RELOCK' BEFORE I CAN OPEN THE DOOR.  I MUST OPEN THE DOOR WITH KEY TURNED IN THE LOOK.  (SAFETY, NO, INCONVENIENT YES.)  HOWEVER, NOW THE POWER LOCKS \"SOMETIMES UNLOCK THEMSELVES\" WHEN LEFT IN A LOCKED POSITION, OR WHEN DRIVING.    4) THE ELECTRIC COOLING FAN, THOUGH IT COMES ON WHEN THE NEEDED, \"SHUTS OFF\" WHEN THE IGNITION IS TURNED OFF.  SHOULDN'T' IT \"STAY ON\" TILL THE RADIATOR COOLS A BIT??    5) THE \"ENGINE STALLED\" AND HESITATED/MISFIRED?.  NUMEROUS TIMES THE DEALER COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM..

WITHIN MOMENTS AFTER GETTING THE KIDS OUT OF THE VEHICLE, THE FRONT OF OUR MINIVAN WAS FULLY ENGULFED IN FLAMES.  BEFORE THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED BY THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, THE ENTIRE ENGINE COMPARTMENT, ALONG WITH THE WINDSHIELD AND HOOD WAS DESTROYED AND THE VEHICLE IS NOW A COMPLETE LOSS.  SINCE WE DID NOT CARRY COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE ON THIS VEHICLE DUE TO ITS AGE, I CONTACTED DAIMLER-CHRYSLER TO MAKE A CLAIM FOR DAMAGES, WHICH CAME TO JUST AROUND $5,300.  DAIMLER-CHRYSLER SENT AN INDEPENDENT INSPECTOR TO OUR RESIDENCE TO INVESTIGATE THE INCIDENT.  THE RESULTS WERE TURNED OVER TO THEIR CLAIM BOARD AND WE WERE ADVISED ON 3-18-05 THAT THEIR COMPANY REFUSED TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FIRE THAT NOT ONLY DESTROYED OUR VEHICLE BUT COULD HAVE EASILY CAUSED INJURY OR DEATH TO MYSELF OR OUR FOUR CHILDREN.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION WEBSITE THAT THERE HAS BEEN NUMEROUS FIRE-RELATED RECALLS ON THE 1997 DODGE MINIVANS.  SPECIFICALLY, AN ARTICLE SHOWED THAT A RECALL EXISTED ON THIS TYPE OF VEHICLE AFTER SEVERAL DEATHS WERE REPORTED AS A RESULT OF FUEL RAIL AND O-RING DEFECTS (DAIMLER CHRYSLER RECALL #895).  AT NO TIME SINCE OUR PURCHASE OF THIS VEHICLE, WAS THERE ANY NOTIFICATION CONCERNING SAFETY RECALLS AND AFTER SPECIFICALLY ASKING A DODGE DEALERSHIP, I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOT.  AFTER RECEIVING THE DENIAL LETTER FROM DAIMLER-CHRYSLER, I SPOKE WITH A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THEIR CLAIMS RESOLUTION GROUP, WHO WOULD NOT GIVE ME A REASON WHY THE CLAIM WAS DENIED AND REFUSED TO SEND ME A COPY OF THEIR INVESTIGATOR'S REPORT.",

THE MINIVAN HAS BEEN VERY WELL MAINTAINED AND AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT HAD ABOUT 124,800 MILES ON IT.    MY WIFE, [XXX], WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE IN A NORTHWEST DIRECTION ON I-40 FROM WILMINGTON TO CHAPEL HILL .  SHE WAS USING THE CRUISE CONTROL AND IS NOT CLEAR EXACTLY WHAT THE SITUATION WAS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT ALTHOUGH IT IS LIKELY THAT SHE HAD ACCELERATED TO PASS ANOTHER VEHICLE.  SUDDENLY THE CAR WAS GOING OVER 90 MPH AND WOULDN\u0019T STOP ALTHOUGH SHE USED THE BRAKES WITH ALL HER FORCE.  SHE TURNED OFF THE IGNITION AND BRAKED TO A STOP ON THE SHOULDER, WITH THE BRAKES SMOKING AND IN FLAME.  IN TRYING TO RESTART THE CAR, THE ENGINE SPEED TOOK OFF AND SHE SHUT IT DOWN AND CALLED AAA FOR A TOW.  THE AAA SERVICE STATION MECHANIC DISCONNECTED THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE FROM THE THROTTLE.  THE CABLE WAS STUCK FAST AND HAD KEPT THE THROTTLE OPEN.  WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE THAT MY WIFE HAD BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL THE VAN WITHOUT COLLIDING WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE OR RUNNING OFF THE ROAD BEFORE BRINGING IT TO A HALT.      THE CABLE APPEARED TO HAVE A BROKEN STRAND THAT STUCK INTO THE OUTER SHEATH.  IT IS ONLY ABOUT 20 INCHES LONG AND MAKES A 180 DEGREE U-TURN BETWEEN THE CRUISE CONTROL VACUUM SERVO AND THE THROTTLE.  THAT DESIGN PLACES MORE STRESS ON THE CABLE THAN IF IT WERE A STRAIGHT RUN.  THE DEFECTIVE CABLE IS AVAILABLE FOR EXAMINATION.    I AM AN MIT GRADUATE MECHANICAL ENGINEER AND FORMER ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF TECHNICAL OPERATIONS FOR CONSUMERS UNION AND I BELIEVE ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN BY NHTSA TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM.

WHILE CHRYSLER &#34;CUSTOMER NO SERVICE&#34; HAS TOLD ME &#34;SIR, WHEN YOU SIGNED THE DOTTED LINE, YOU KNEW THE WARRANTY WAS 36,000 MILES&#34;, CLEARLY THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION IS THAT TRANSMISSIONS IN $30,000 AUTOMOBILES SHOULD LAST MORE THAN 90,000 MILES.  WHILE CHRYSLER CAN HIDE BEHIND THE WARRANTY ALL THEY WANT, THEY CLEARLY ARE BREAKING WITH THE PUBLIC''S TRUST.  THE FACT THAT CHRYSLER HAS HAD 100,000 MILE DRIVETRAIN WARRANTIES ON OTHER YEARS OF GRAND CARAVANS BESPEAKS TO THE LEVELS THAT THEY: 1.  HAD TO GO TO GAIN PUBLIC TRUST 2.

WE HAD JUST LEFT OUR PARKING SPOT WHEN WE PASSED OVER WHAT I ASSUMED WAS A SPEED BUMP GOING APPROXIMATELY 5 MPH HEADING TOWARD THE TICKET BOOTH WHICH WAS JUST AHEAD.  AS WE PASSED THIS SPEED BUMP OUR AIR BAGS SPONTANEOUSLY DEPLOYED FOR NO APPARENT REASON.  THERE IS NO DAMAGE TO OUR VEHICLE THAT WOULD JUSTIFY THE AIR BAGS GOING OFF AS THEY DID.  WE HAVE INFORMED OUR DEALERSHIP OF THIS PROBLEM, AS WE FEEL THAT THE AIR BAGS ARE FAULTY, AND THEY ALSO AGREED AT THAT TIME THAT THERE WAS NO CAUSE FOR THE AIR BAGS TO DEPLOY.  I SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MANAGER, [XXX] AT THE M-59 DODGE DEALER WHO SAID THAT WE WOULD BE CONTACTED AND THE MATTER INVESTIGATED.  I SPOKE TO A [XXX]. , WITH THE CHRYSLER INVESTIGATIONS DEPT WHO STATED TO ME THAT THEY DETERMINED THAT THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYED FROM IMPACT WITH A SPEED BUMP AND NO FURTHER ASSISTANCE WOULD BE FORTHCOMING.  WE FEEL THAT THIS SHOULD BE LOOKED AT AS A POSSIBLE PROBLEM IN THE AIR BAG SYSTEM AND AT THE LEAST HAVE THE CAR FIXED, AS OUR DASH BOARD IS ALL TORE APART AT THIS TIME, MAKING THE CAR VIRTUALLY UNDRIVABLE.  WE HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS  ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AS THIS COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN A WORSE SITUATION IF WE HAD BEEN DRIVING HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND PASSED A BUMP OR HIT A POT HOLE AND THESE BAGS HAD DEPLOYED,CAUSING LOSS OF CONTROL AND A POSSIBLE  ACCIDENT/FATALITY.

NOTICED THAT WHEN THE STEERING LOCKED, I WAS DRIVING THE CAR BETWEEN 5 AND 10 MILES PER HOUR.  ALSO, WHEN STEERING WHEEL LOCKED, POWER BRAKES WOULD FAIL.  HAD TO LITERALLY STAND ON BRAKE PEDAL OR TURN OFF CAR IGNITION TO STOP CAR.  THREW CAR IN PARK AND TURNED THE IGNITION IMMEDIATELY TO REGAIN STEERING AND BRAKES.  HAD NO STEERING CAPABILITY AT ALL.

TOOK CAR INTO DEALER ON 6/24/02 AND THEY WORKED ON IT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE DECIDING  THE PROBLEM WAS SOME PART OF THE STEERING COLUMN.  THEY COULD REPLICATE THE PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING BUT NOT WITH THE BRAKES.  THEY REPLACED SOME COMPONENT OF THE POWER STEERING AND RELEASED THE CAR 6/26/02. PICKED UP THE CAR ON 6/27/02.

I AM FORWARDING A COPY OF THE COMPLAINT I ENLISTED WITH CENTURY/GRACO CHILDRENS PRODUCTS.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS CONCERN IN THAT THERE IS NO WAY POSSIBLE THAT ANY OF THE CAR SEATS IN THIS CATAGORY COULD BE ANY MORE FUNCTIONAL OR LESS DANGEROUS THAN THE ONE I HAVE.  THE REASON IS THAT ALL THE CAR SEATS HAVE THE SAME PLASTIC USED FOR THE BASES.  HERE IS THE ATTACHED MEMO:  I HAVE A VERY SERIOUS CONCERN WHICH WAS RECENTLY BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION.  THE CAR SEAT BASE IN REFERENCE TO THE CAR SEAT MODEL STATED ABOVE HAS A SERIOUS STRUCTURAL DEFECT.  WHEN OUR LOCAL DODGE DEALERSHIP WAS INSTALLING OUR CAR SEAT IN OUR NEW VEHICLE THE BASE WOULD NOT ANGLE PROPERLY.  WHEN THE BASE WAS EXAMINED BY THE INSPECTOR, SHE DISCOVERED THE PLASTIC ON THE BASE WAS SEVERLY BENT IN TWO PLACES COMPRIMISING ITS SAFETY AS WELL AS ITS COMFORT FOR THE CHILD.  THE AREA IN QUESTION IS THE PIECE THAT ELEVATES THE FRONT OF THE CAR SEAT (IN THIS CASE THE PIECE IN QUESTION IS DARK BLUE).  IN ADDITION TO THIS PIECE, THE WHITE PLASTIC PIECES WHICH STAND OUT FROM THE SIDE IN THE AREA OR CHANNEL IN WHICH THE \"BLUE\" PIECE SLIDES IN AND OUT OF IS BENT ON EACH SIDE.   THIS IS A HUGE CONCERN IN THAT THIS CANNOT BE THE ONLY ONE OUT THERE THAT IS THIS WAY.  HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU KNOW THAT WOULD PERIODICALLY LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF THERE BASE TO CHECK THIS OUT?  THIS IS A MAJOR AND VERY SERIOUS CONCERN.   PLEASE ADVISE AS TO REPLACING MY BASE FOR ME.  I HAVE THE ABILITY, IF YOU NEED ME TOO TO SEND DIGITAL PHOTOS OF THE AREA IN QUESTION.  PLEASE PROVIDE ME AN EMAIL ADDRESS AND I WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO DO THIS.*AK",

HE SAID THAT THE ONLY OTHER TIRES HE HAS SEEN THAT LOOKED LIKE THIS WERE THE FIRESTORE TIRES ON THE SUVS.  WHEN I WENT TO THE TIRE DEALER TO REPLACE THE TIRE, HE HAD THE SAME TYPE OF COMMENTS.  IT WAS OBVIOUS TO THE TWO REPAIR MEN THAT THESE TIRES WERE DEFECTVIE.  BOTH SAID WE WERE LUCKY TO BE ALIVE GIVEN THE CONDITION OF THE TIRE.  MY QUESTION IS NOW, WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH THE OTHER ONE THAT IS ON THERE, AND CAN I GET RETRIBUTION FOR THE COST OF THESE TIRES.  ALSO, HOW CAN I FIND OUT IF THIS HAS HAPPENED TO OTHERS IN THE PAST?

THE ELECTRICAL POWER DID COME BACK UP BUT ONLY SUFFICIENT TO GIVE LESS THAN HALF THE NORMAL ILLUMINATION TO THE HEADLIGHTS AS BOTH AIRCONDITIONERS WERE OPERATIING AS WERE THE LIGHTS AND WIPERS. THE INCIDENT HAPPENED ON A TWISTING WET ROAD IN THE EVERGLADES WITH A CANAL ON THE OUTSIDE OF AN APPROACHING BEND IN THE ROAD.

DISCUSSION WITH TWO CHRYSLER DEALERS AS WELL AS SEVERAL TOW TRUCK DRIVERS INDICATES THAT THIS IS A VERY FREQUENT CAUSE OF ACCIDENTS. ONE DEALER SAID THEY HAVE TO REPLACE ONE OF THESE TENSIONERS EVERY DAY BUT IT SEEMS TO TAKE 36 OR MORE MONTHS FOR THE DEFECT TO SHOW UP HENCE IT DOES NOT APPEAR ON CHRYSLERS' WARRANTY LIST OF FREQUENT FAILURES ALTHOUGH CHRYSLER MUST BE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM DUE TO THE INORDINATE NUMBER OF REPLACEMENT TENSIONERS THEY HAVE TO SHIP TO THEIR DEALERS. MECHANICAL INSPECTION OF THE PART SHOWS NOT ONLY POOR DESIGN BUT ALSO, IN MY CASE, DEFECTIVE MANUFACTURING OF THE HIGH TENSILE BOLT USED TO ATTACHE THE TENSIONER TO THE ENGINE.

LATER THAT WEEK I WAS TOLD THAT THE HEAD GASKET WAS OK BUT THE CAMSHAFT WAS BROKEN ($1400). ON THURSDAY I WAS TOLD THAT THE CAMSHAFT BEARINGS WERE DAMAGED AND THAT I WOULD NEED TO EITHER PURCHASE A REBUILT SHORTBLOCK OR LONGBLOCK ($3,300/$3,800). I WENT TO THE DEALER TO VIEW MY ENGINE (NOW DISASSEMBLED ON A BENCH) AND THE CAMSHAFT WAS IN TWO PIECES. A CLEAN BREAK WITH NO BLUE COLOR ON EITHER THE CAMSHAFT NOR THE CAMSHAFT BEARINGS. I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT CAMSHAFT BEARINGS WERE ONLY SERVICED BY USING THE SHORTBOCK (I.E., THEY WANTED TO SELL ME THE WHOLE WORKS. FROM A HAYES MANUAL I PURCHASED I DISCOVERED THAT YOU COULD INDEED REPLACE THE CAMSHAFT BEARINGS (SEEMS LOGICAL AS CHRYSLER DOES REBUILD ENGINES FOR RESALE). HOWEVER I WAS TOLD THAT THE DEALER DID NOT DO THIS. I ASKED THEM TO FIND AN AUTOMOTIVE MACHINE SHOP THAT WOULD DO THIS. AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS WITH NO CALL BACKS I FOUND A COUPLE OF MACHINE SHOPS THAT WOULD DO THE JOB FOR $35-$150. WHEN I TOLD THE SERVICE MANAGER THIS INFORMATION HE SAID THEY COULD GET THE CAMSHAFT BUT NOT THE BEARINGS. THE SERVICE MANAGER ASKED ME IF THE MACHINE SHOP COULD GET THE BEARINGS. THEIR BOOK SHOWED CAMSHAFT BEARINGS FOR MINI VANS UP TO 92 ONLY. THEY PROBED FURTHER AND DISCOVERED THE BEARINGS LISTED FOR THE 3.3L CARS WERE INDEED THE SAME PART NEEDED FOR THE 3.3L CARAVAN. NEXT WEEK I HOPE TO BE BACK ON THE ROAD FOR A LOT LESS $$$ THAN THE OPTIONS THAT WERE PRESENTED TO ME.... STILL NOT SATISFIED AS TO THE REASON FOR THE BREAKAGE. IT WASN'T OIL STARVATION AS THE OIL PORTS ON THE CAMSHAFT BEARINGS WERE STILL IN ALIGNMENT. THE OIL PUMP IS ALSO STILL WORKING.

WHEN I ARRIVED THE ENGINE (FAN BELT SIDE) HAD BEEN SPRAYED WITH GAS AND GAS DRIPPING FROM UNDERNEATH AND PUDDLED UNDER THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT TIRE. I TRIED TO SEE IF IT WOULD START AND PROBABLY ANOTHER QUART OF GAS OR SO PUMP OUT BEFORE MY WIFE NOTICED THERE WAS GAS RUNNING OUT THE BOTTOM OF VAN. A MAN WHO HAD STOPPED TO HELP, ACTUALLY FOUND THE GAS LINE PROBLEM AND SNAPPED IT BACK ON, AFTER TUGGING ON THE LINE SOME TO SEE IF IT WOULD COME OFF I AGREED TO TRY STARTING IT AGAIN.(I HAD ALREADY CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND WASN'T CRAZY ABOUT STARTING IT WITH ALL THE GAS AROUND) IT STARTED UP AND RAN ABOUT 10 MINUTES AND IT POPPED OFF AGAIN. WHEN IT POPPED OFF THE SECOND TIME WE WERE WATCHING, THE DANGEROUS THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT BEFORE IT COMPLETLY POPPED OFF AND KILLED THE ENGINE IT SPRAYED GAS OVER THE FRONT OF THE ENGINE FOR APPROX 5 - 10 SECONDS. WE POPPED IT BACK ON AGAIN AND STARTED IT, BUT THE TOW TRUCK WAS THERE BY THEN AND WE HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALER TO GET IT CHECKED OUT.    THE DEALER KEPT THE VAN 4 DAYS AND SAID THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG. I PICKED IT UP AFTER TRYING TO GET THEM TO REPLACE THE CONNECTOR BUT THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T REPLACE IT UNTILL THEY COULD DUPLICATE IT POPPING OFF, I GUESS SEE IT COME OFF THEMSELVES. I'M DRIVING IT NOW BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD TO LET THEM KEEP IT ANOTHER 20,000 MILES SO THEY CAN SEE IT POP APART.   I HAVE CHECKED FOR SIMILAR PROBLEMS ON YOUR WEB SITE AND FOUND NONE. I DON'T KNOW IF OUR VAN IS THE ONLY ONE WITH THE FAULTY FITTING OR MAY BE OTHERS, THAT'S WHY I AM WRITING YOU AND AFTER SEEING HOW THE FITTING COMES APART IS REALLY SCARY WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT POPPING APART ON HOT ENGING INSTEAD OF A COLD ENGINE.    WHAT WORRIES ME IS THAT IT CAME LOSE THE FIRST TIME AND THINK IT MIGHT BE WORTH LOOKING INTO BECAUSE THEIR IS POTENTIAL FOR A FIRE, EVEN WITHOUT THE FIRE IT SCARED MY WIFE A",
