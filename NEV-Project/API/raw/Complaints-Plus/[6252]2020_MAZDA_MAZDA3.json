Traffic was bumper to bumper and moving anywhere from 0mph to maybe 5mph.  I was in the middle of the bridge driving approximately 5mph and my 2020 Mazda 3 beeped (collision warning) and applied brakes.  I was almost rear ended and my two passengers were jolted forward.  I maintained a safe following distance the entire time.  I believe a van on my left triggered my car\u2019s actions as it passed.  I was in no danger of getting into an accident although I was quite shaken up since this is the first time my car applied its brakes.  I have an appointment to bring my car in and would like the automatic braking system disabled.  Previously, the car from time to time has alerted of a collision always under 40mph and a previous inspection of my vehicle (after I reported collision warning activation) revealed  everything was working properly.",

It brakes, sometimes, for a vehicle in the right lane (we, in the left), and continues to brake unless we override the system. No problem--except if there may be someone following too closely, it could cause a collision. It seems to be related to the MRCC, as no \"Brake!\" warning accompanies the unwanted brake application. I've contacted Mazda numerous times; they recommended taking it to the dealer. I have--they can find nothing wrong. All of this seems related to a MRCC update (SSP C5) that was done to smooth the MRCC's operation. It did fix the sudden deceleration and acceleration when following other vehicles, but now is worse in other aspects. I may be wrong, but it all seems to be a software issue, so it's not surprising that the dealer can find \"no concerns\". As to the date of this incident, it happens nearly every time we take the car on a highway or interstate.",
