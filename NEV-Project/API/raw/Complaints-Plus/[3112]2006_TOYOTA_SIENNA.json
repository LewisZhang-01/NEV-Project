IT WAS ALL GOOEY AND STICKY TO THE TOUCH. IT WAS SHINING LIKE IT WAS COATED IN GREASE OR OIL. THE GLARE REFLECTED IN THE WINDSHIELD AND I COULD NOT SEE. I WAS ONLY 4 MILES FROM HOME AND I CRAWLED ON THE EDGE OF THE ROAD WITH THE WINDOW OPEN. I CALLED TOYOTA WHEN I GOT HOME AND FILED A CASE WHEN THEM.

I WENT TO THE DEALER ON 8/22/17, WHERE I HAD ASKED FOR THE DASHBOARD BACK ON 9/3/16 AND WAS TOLD THEY SIDED WITH TOYOTA, THEY WOULD NOT EVEN ORDER IT UNLESS I PAID IN ADVANCE. I ASKED THIS SECOND SERVICE ADVISOR TO LOOK AT THE DASH AND CONFIRM IT WAS THE MELTING DASHBOARD PROBLEM. HE DID CONFIRM IT. I ASKED HIM HOW IT WAS POSSIBLE TO HAVE JUST GOTTEN STICKY ON 8/19/17. HE TOLD ME THAT IF IT WAS NOT STICKY WHEN I ASKED FOR THE REPLACEMENT, ACCORDING TO INSTRUCTIONS FROM TOYOTA, THIS IS WHY THE DEALER DID NOT ORDER IT. IT WOULD COST ME OVER $2000 FOR A REPLACEMENT DASH!",

THEY REPAIRED IT. I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE RECALL UNTIL AFTER I HAD IT FIXED. I NOTIFIED TOYOTA ABOUT THE INCIDENT AND ASKED FOR A REFUND ON THE SERVICES. THEY WOULD NOT GIVE ME MY REFUND BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE THE ORIGINAL RECEIPT AND INVOICE. AS FAR AS I AM AWARE THEY STILL DO NOT HAVE AN AUTHORIZED PART TO REPLACE IT YET! TOYOTA CASE # 1507170610.",

I CALLED THE TOYOTA NUMBER LISTED ON THE WARRANTY SEVERAL TIMES AND SPOKE WITH TOYOTA REPRESENTATIVES BUT THEY ULTIMATELY STATED MY ISSUE WAS WITH THE DEALERSHIP-NOT TOYOTA.

I DROVE INTO THE DRIVEWAY AND ATTEMPTED TO REVERSE MY MINIVAN, I HAD MY HAND ON THE SHIFT CHANGE TO SHIFT MY CAR, UPON ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE SHIFTS MY CAR ACCELERATED AND I LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE, CAUSING MY CAR TO GO HIT THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH DAMAGING THE GAS TANK, AND CAUSING THE  GAS TO LEAK. AT THE TIME OF THE SCENE AND ACCIDENT MY 6 YEAR OLD WAS IN HIS CARSEAT BEHIND ME AND WAS SCARED AT WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED, HE PANICKED AND TOOK OFF HIS SEAT BELT, OPENED THE DOOR, AND WENT RUNNING OUT OF THE VEHICLE.. AT THAT MOMENT TRYING TO REGROUP MYSELF TO SEE WHY MY CAR  HAD ACCELERATED WITH FORCE FORWARD, I PARKED MY VEHICLE AND WENT LOOKING FOR HELP.. I CANNOT EXPLAIN HOW MY CAR GAINED SO MUCH FORCE TO END UP OVER 2 FEET IN THE AIR OVER A SMALL WALL... I DID NOTICE MY CAR HIT THE GAS TANK AND HEARD GAS LEAKING AND WENT TO CRY FOR HELP.. I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY RECALLS ON MY VAN EXCEPT FOR THE UNDERCARRIAGE TIRE, WHICH AT THIS TIME THE RECALL IS NOT COMPLETE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT FINALIZED A SCHEDULE FOR ME TO HAVE IT CHECKED... ALSO I AM UPSET THAT THE MINIVAN UPON THE IMPACT OF HITTING THE WALL DID NOT DIPLOIT THE AIRBAG... I GOOGLED SAFETY RECALL ON TOYOTA SIENNA AND CAME UPON A RECALL ON MORE THAN 615K SIENNA  MODELS  OVER A ROLLAWAY RISK.. THE YEARS LISTED WERE 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009 TOYOTA SIENNA,AND A RECALL AFFECTING  A POSSIBLE ROLLAWAY UPON SHIFT GEARS.. ACCORDING TO THE ARTICLE THE SHIFT LEVER COLD BE MOVED OUT OF POSITION DEPRESSING THE  THE BRAKE PEDAL, AND BECAUSE OF THIS FAULT, THE AFFECTED SIENNAS COULD  ROLL AWAY WITHOUT CAUSING WARNING, INCREASING THE RISK FOR CRASH..

THE SRS LIGHT WAS FIRST OBSERVED FLASHING SEVERAL TIMES IN MARCH 2010, BUT THEN STOPPED.  IT STARTED FLASHING AGAIN WHILE ON A CROSS-STATE TRIP IN DECEMBER 2010.  AS I HAD, MY WIFE AND TWO YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE VAN, I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OFF THE ROAD AND CALLED THE DEALERSHIP (TOYOTA OF RICHARDSON, RICHARDSON TX).  I WAS ADVISED AT THAT TIME THAT IT WOULD BE SAFE FOR ME TO CONTINUE WITH MY TRIP.  WHEN I RETURNED HOME, I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE DEALER TOOK NO ACTION STATING ON THE SERVICE TICKET THE SRS LIGHT WAS \"??NOT FLASHING TODAY\"??.   TO DATE, THE SRS LIGHT CONTINUES TO FLASH ON AND OFF AT WEEKS OR MONTHS AT A TIME.     FROM THE INTERNET, I RECENTLY LEARNED THAT A TSB #284073 (NHTSA  ACTION NUMBER: 10034130) WAS ISSUED BY TOYOTA TO ITS DEALERSHIPS BACK ON JUNE 23, 2010 (SIX MONTHS BEFORE I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN), AS WELL AS THREE EARLIER TSB'S (EL001-08, TSB-0252-08 & TSB-0162-10) ALL RELATED TO SRS LAMP/SENSORS .

IN JULY 2013, MY VAN WAS INVOLVED IN A REAR-END COLLISION.  THE AIR BAG DID NOT DEPLOY.  WAS ITS FAILURE TO DEPLOY DUE TO THE NATURE/INTENSITY OF THE IMPACT, OR THE FACT THAT THE SRS SYSTEM IS NOT PROPERLY FUNCTIONING?  I HAVE NO ASSURANCE IT WORKS PROPERLY.

THEY TOLD ME THAT THE TRANSMISSION OIL HAD ALL LEAKED OUT DUE TO THE BURST OF ABRUPT FAILURE ON THE INLET TO THE RADIATOR. THEY ASKED ME TO REPLACE THE RADIATOR AT A COST OF $1,150.26!

SINCE THAT THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE VAN CAN BE DRIVEN. I WAS PREPARED TO TRADE IT IN AND WEIGHING MY OPTIONS. THE VAN HAS 133,279 MILES. I DROVE IT OK INITIALLY, HOWEVER, I EXPERIENCED THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ACCELERATE TWICE. AFTER 15 MILES WHEN I STOPPED AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT, THE VAN JUST STUCK- IT CANNOT MOVE IN ANY OF THE GEARS AT ALL. I TOWED BACK HOME. AFTER COOLING DOWN, IT WAS ABLE TO DRIVE AGAIN.

I AM WONDERING WHY:  ?WHY THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS NOT LIT UP AT ALL WHEN THE COOLANT TEMPERATURE WAS SO HIGH BEFORE SPOILING THE WHOLE TRANSMISSION?  ?WHY WAS THAT NOT EVEN ANY DTC CODES STORED ON THE OBDII SYSTEMS AT ALL AFTER ALL THESE DEFECTS?  ?THIS SEEMED THE SAME PROBLEM AS THE STICKY TRANSMISSION THAT OTHER CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT, YET TOYOTA HAS NOT INFORMING THE CUSTOMER OF ANY ACTIONS NEED TO BE TAKE.

DEALER ALSO SHOWED ME A TOYOTA WARRANTY COVERAGE ENHANCEMENT FOR THIS PROBLEM  (THE \"DOOR CHECK MOUNTING PANEL,\" POL07-04, ISSUED 10/22/07), WHICH EXTENDS UP TO 5 YEARS OR 100,000 MILES.

THIS CLEARLY IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT WHICH TOYOTA SHOULD COVER, REGARDLESS OF MILEAGE.    (2) POWER SLIDING DOOR WILL NOT OPERATE WHEN INTERIOR BUTTONS OR KEY FOB BUTTONS ARE PUSHED.

THE PASSENGER SEAT HAS A BIN THAT SLIDES IN AND OUT DIRECTLY ABOVE THE WIRES FOR THE SRS!  I HAVE JOSTLED THE WIRES AND THE LIGHT GOES OFF.  SO NOW I DON'T KNOW IF MY AIRBAGS EVEN WORK.

FURTHERMORE, IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY, THIS EXIT POINT WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US.

I WAS TOLD THE PART NUMBERS DID NOT MATCH.     IN JULY 2013, I OPENED A CASE WITH TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE. THEY AGAIN INFORMED ME THE PARTS WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER THE ENHANCEMENT WARRANTY. I EXPRESSED MY COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT FOR THE LACK OF REGARD FOR MY FAMILY'S SAFETY. SHORTLY AFTER, I RECEIVED A SURPRISING CALL FROM THE DEALERSHIP EXPLAINING THAT THE PART IN QUESTION WAS ACTUALLY COVERED. THEIR ERROR WAS UPSETTING. I HAD TO TAKE MY VEHICLE IN TWICE TO FINALLY HAVE THE DOOR REPAIRED AND HAD TO PAY FOR AN ADDITIONAL PART, A HINGE THAT CAUSED THE DOOR TO SAG AND DRAG AGAINST THE BODY OF THE VEHICLE WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE SAFETY ISSUE AND ALSO CAUSED VISIBLE DAMAGE TO THE EXTERIOR. I'M THANKFUL THE DOOR IS FINALLY REPAIRED, BUT WORRY THAT THIS ISSUE HAS GREAT POTENTIAL FOR RECURRENCE.

ATTEMPTED REPAIRS BY DEALER ON AUGUST 4, 2009 UNDER WARRANTY REPLACED THE AIRBAG ASSEMBLY ON ONE SIDE BUT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM OF REPEATED INTERMITTENT FAILURE.

THIS PROPOSED REPAIR APPARENTLY INCLUDED REPLACING THE PREVIOUSLY REPLACED AIRBAG AS WELL AS THE ASSEMBLY ON THE OTHER SIDE. I DELAYED THE REPAIR AT RISK TO FAMILY ON ACCOUNT OF THE EXTREME COST. ALSO, I APPEALED TO TOYOTA CORPORATE REPRESENTATIVES SINCE THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN A PERSISTENT AND UNREMEDIED ONE SINCE DURING THE WARRANTY PERIOD.

IN NOVEMBER 2012 THE SRS LIGHT CAME BACK AND THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO TOYOTA AGAIN. THE CAUSE WAS AGAIN CODE EL1110, NEEDING REPLACEMENT OF HARNESS. SINCE HARNESS WAS JUST RECENTLY REPLACED, THE REPAIR TECHNICIAN VERIFIED EVERY PIN ON THE CONNECTOR AND FOUND SOME PINS NOT MAKING GOOD CONTACT AND REPAIRED THE PROBLEM. ON APRIL 3, 2013 THE SRS WARNING LIGHT IS ON YET AGAIN! PLAN TO TAKE THE CAR TO TOYOTA DEALER AGAIN BUT  I AM GETTING SUSPICIOUS THAT THERE MAY BE A LARGER MORE SERIOUS PROBLEM HIDDEN IN THE AIRBAG SYSTEM OF THIS VEHICLE. FORTUNATE TO EXTENDED WARRANTY, I HAD NOT BEEN CHARGED FOR PAST REPAIRS, BUT IT WAS IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. MY WARRANTY IS TO EXPIRE SHORTLY AND I FEEL I WILL BE DEALING WITH THIS LIFE THREATENING ISSUE SHOULD TOYOTA NOT INVESTIGATE AND FIND A SOUND SOLUTION  OR PROVIDE A RECALL ON SRS SYSTEM FOR THIS VINTAGE VEHICLE.   *TR",

LUCKILY THE DEALER CONVINCED TOYOTA USA TO COVER THE REPAIR. IN NOVEMBER 2011 THE LIGHT AGAIN CAME ON AND DID ITS BLINKING THING. CURRENTLY WE HAVE A LITTLE OVER 48000 MILES ON THE VAN AND THE DEALER SAID THAT BECAUSE WE ARE PAST WARRANTY THAT IT WON'T BE COVERED. A PRIVATE MECHANIC TESTED THE SYSTEM AND DETERMINED THE AIRBAGS ARE NOT FUNCTIONING AND THAT TOYOTA HAS PUBLISHED A BULLETIN ACKNOWLEDGING THE ISSUE BUT REFUSES TO REPAIR THIS SAFETY CONCERN. WHEN THE LIGHT IS BLINKING OR ON, THE AIRBAGS WILL NOT DEPLOY, PUTTING EVERYONE INSIDE AT RISK. A VAN WITH 48000 MILES SHOULD NOT HAVE TO HAVE THE AIRBAGS REPLACED TWICE. LOOKING AT ONLINE FORUMS THERE SEEMS TO BE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF OTHER SIENNA OWNERS EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS AND YET TOYOTA STILL REFUSES TO RECALL THE PRODUCT OR OFFER A REASONABLE REPAIR. I AM AFRAID THAT IT WILL TAKE A TRAFFIC COLLISION RESULTING IN A DEATH OR MULTIPLE DEATHS TO PUSH TOYOTA TO FIX THIS SYSTEMIC PROBLEM. A SECOND CONCERN WHICH SEEMS TO BE PROBLEMATIC WITH OUR VAN AS WELL AS OTHERS IS THE WELDS WITHIN THE DRIVER DOOR BREAKING. THE VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT NOR ANY OTHER MAJOR INCIDENT TO CAUSE THEM TO BREAK.

THE DEALER WANTS $2000+ TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.  THERE ARE STORIES OF BACK ORDERS ON THIS PART BEING UP TO 4 MONTHS.  TOYOTA KNOWS THERE IS A PROBLEM, BUT NOW NEEDS TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND DO A RECALL TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.  I DON'T LIKE DRIVING A FAMILY VEHICLE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE SAFE, BUT IS NOT BECAUSE OF THIS FAULT IN THE AIRBAG SYSTEM.  VERY FRUSTRATING.",

SERVICE MANAGER AT DEALER CONTACTED TOYOTA HEADQUARTERS TO HELP ME OUT, WHICH HE DID, THEY WILL PAY FOR PARTS AND I WILL PAY FOR REPAIR, $1327. I CONTACTED TOYOTA HEADQUARTERS MYSELF, I WAS TOLD THAT IN FACT MY AIRBAG SYSTEM WAS DEFECTIVE AND THAT SINCE I WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, THEM PAYING FOR THE PARTS WAS THE BEST THEY COULD DO. I WAS THEN CONTACTED BY A TOYOTA PARTS SPECIALIST WHO ADVISED ME THAT THE WIRE HARNESS FOR MY VAN WAS ON ORDER, EXPECTED TO ARRIVE AT THE REPAIRING DEALER APPROXIMATELY 12/15. THE REPAIRING DEALER CONTACTED ME AS WELL AND TOLD ME THAT THE WIRE HARNESS WAS PLACED ON ORDER EXPECTED TO ARRIVE ON 12/15, AND THAT THEY HAD PUT IN AS A RUSH.  ON 12/15 THE SAME TOYOTA PARTS SPECIALIST LEFT ME A VOICEMAIL ON MY CELLPHONE ADVISING ME THAT IN FACT THE PART (WIRE HARNESS) SHOWED AS SHIPPED TO DEALER IN THEIR DATABASE, HOWEVER THIS WAS NOT ACCURATE HE SAID \"THE PART (WIRE HARNESS) HAS NOT BEEN EVEN MANUFACTURED YET\". ALTHOUGH TOYOTA HAS PUT ME ON A RENTAL CAR, IT IS VERY CONCERNING TO ME AND MY FAMILY THAT TOYOTA HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO COME UP WITH A FIX INVOLVING A SAFETY ISSUE, WITH A MALFUNCTIONING WIRE HARNESS THE AIRBAGS ARE INOPERABLE. I THINK THAT TOYOTA SHOULDN'T BE BRAGGING ABOUT SAFETY AND SECURITY AS IN MY CASE, THEY HAVE A MALFUNCTIONING PART WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN USED AND CANNOT BE USED, WORST YET THEY CAN'T FIX.  *TR",

THE AIRBAG SENSORS ARE NOT COMMUNICATING WITH THE COMPUTER. WE WERE TOLD THAT IN ORDER TO FIX THE PROBLEM THEY WOULD NEED TO REPLACE THE AIRBAG. OUR CAR IS 3 YEARS OLD. WE HAVE 77,000 MILES ON IT. IT IS OUR MAIN VEHICLE FOR WORK, SCHOOL, TRANSPORTING OUR TWO CHILDREN. BECAUSE OF MILEAGE WE ARE OVER OUR WARRANTY AND THEY REFUSE TO COVER THE COST OF REPLACING THE AIRBAG.

THEY GOT THEIR AIRBAGS REPLACED ONLY TO HAVE THE PROBLEM OCCUR AGAIN AND AGAIN. WE WERE ALSO TOLD THAT BECAUSE THE LIGHT IS ON, THERE IS A CHANCE THAT NONE OF OUR AIRBAGS WILL DEPLOY IF WE ARE IN AN ACCIDENT. THIS IS A VERY FRUSTRATING SITUATION. TOYOTA IS ONCE AGAIN HAVING PROBLEMS WITH SENSORS ON THEIR SAFETY FEATURES ON THEIR CARS. THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN WHEN THEY RIDE IN THIS CAR. WE ASKED TO SPEAK TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AND WERE TOLD TODAY (MARCH 29) THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO FOR US. WE WILL HAVE TO PAY $411 FOR THE AIRBAG AND PARTS AND THEN $340 FOR THE LABOR OR CHOOSE TO RISK OUR SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF OUR CHILDREN IF WE ARE IN AN ACCIDENT.

I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE TOYOTA DEALER NOTHING IS WRONG.  RECENTLY, ON A VERY COLD DAY I NOTICED THE STEERING WHEEL WAS EXTREMELY STIFF AND HARD TO MOVE- ALMOST LIKE NOT HAVING POWERING STEERING.  THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON WHY I AM FILING THIS IS BECAUSE I TOO HAVE STARTED TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE RIGHT SIDE PASSENGER SLIDING DOOR.  IT STARTED TO MALFUNCTION IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR (2010)- ONE MONTH AGO.  FIRST THE DOOR WOULDN'T OPEN.  IT WOULD POP TO RELEASE BUT NOT REALLY OPEN .  YOU COULD NOT MOVE THE DOOR TO FULLY OPEN IT OR THEN CLOSE IT.  AFTER A WHILE YOU COULD THEN MANUALLY OPEN THE DOOR.  THIS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES BUT WOULD SPORADICALLY WORK.  TOYOTA REPLACED THE MOTOR- WE HAVE PLATINUM WARRANTY.  THEN A FEW WEEKS LATER IT STARTED TO MALFUNCTION AGAIN.  I TOOK IT BACK AND THEY ADJUSTED THE DOOR.  ALMOST IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO MALFUNCTION AGAIN AND IS WORSE THAN BEFORE-INOPERABLE MOST OF THE TIME.  I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE WHOLE DOOR IS OUT OF ALIGNMENT AND THE BODY SHOP HAS TO ADJUST THE DOOR I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN AND TOYOTA DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE AN ANSWER.  DOOR IS STILL NOT FIXED- I HAVE TO BRING IT BACK, BUT ANOTHER PERSON I THINK IS ON THE RIGHT TRACK WITH THE HINGE FAILING AND THAT IS PROBABLY WHY THE DOOR IS NOT ALIGNED. ASIDE FROM THE INCONVENIENCE A DOOR FAILURE IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED ASAP! *TR",

FRONT LATCH CAN BE SECURED WITH GREAT FORCE, HOWEVER THE REAR LATCH WILL NOT ENGAGE.  DOOR REMAINS OPEN AND IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY RISK AS THE FRONT LATCH SECURITY/RELIABILITY IS INSUFFICIENT.  SLIDING DOOR COULD OPEN WITHOUT WARNING WHILE DRIVING 70 MPH.  LIGHTS IN VAN STAY ON, PRESENTING ANOTHER RISK AT NIGHT BECAUSE VISION IS INHIBITED GREATLY BY INTERIOR LIGHTING.  HAD TO DRIVE HOME WITHOUT DOOR FULLY CLOSED AT NIGHT.  THIS LACK OF VISIBILITY NEARLY RESULTED IN SEVERAL ACCIDENTS.  PROBLEM STEMS FROM THE MECHANISM THAT GRABS THE METAL LOOP THAT IS CONNECTED TO THE REAR DOOR FRAME. THE C SHAPED LATCH IS COVERED WITH A PLASTIC COATING WHICH WHEN WORN OR DAMAGED ALLOWS MOISTURE IN AND THE METAL CLAMP SWELLS UP AND BINDS THE LATCH. NO AMOUNT OF LUBRICATION WILL HELP. TOYOTA MADE A BIG MISTAKE BY PLASTIC COATING A METAL THAT WOULD RUST AND SWELL UP THE OUTER COATING FROM THE INSIDE MAKING THE LATCH NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY.  THIS IS A SERIOUS DESIGN DEFECT.

IT IS AN ISSUE OF USING CRUISE CONTROL WITH THE SONAR ACTIVATED TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN TO MAINTAIN A SAFE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE CAR IN FRONT OF YOU.  WHEN THE CAR IN FRONT MOVED OUT OF YOUR LANE, YOUR CAR TAKES OFF LIKE A ROCKET TO REGAIN THE PROGRAMMED SPEED.  I HAVE A TOYOTA SIENNA MINI VAN THAT DOES THE SAME THING HE DESCRIBED.  WHEN I COMPLAIN TO THE DEALER THEY TELL ME IT WORKS AS DESIGNED. I ASK THEM IF THEY WANT TO DRIVE THEIR KIDS AROUND ON THE INTERSTATES USING THE CRUISE CONTROL WITH THE SONAR ACTIVATED OR PAY MY SPEEDING TICKET WHEN I GET PULLED OVER WHEN IT DOES  THIS.  AFTER ACCELERATING AT SUCH A HIGH SPEED THE BRAKING MECHANISM KICKS IN TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN. SO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE GONE ABOVE THE SPEED YOU SET THE CRUISE CONTROL.  A CAR SHOULDN'T TAKE OFF LIKE A ROCKET AND CAUSE YOU TO SPEED WHEN THE CAR IN FRONT OF YOU MOVES OUT OF YOUR LANE.  IT ALSO DOES THIS WITH THE SONAR OFF AND HITTING THE \"RESUME SPEED\" SWITCH ON THE CRUISE.  I HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH THIS ISSUE, BUT IT SURE IS SCARY WHEN IT DOES THIS.  AS A RESULT, I DON'T USE MY CRUISE CONTROL VERY OFTEN AND IF I DO, USUALLY KICK IT OFF BY TAPPING THE BRAKE WHEN THE SONAR SLOWS THE CAR DOWN SO IT DOESN'T TAKE OFF LIKE A ROCKET.

PROBLEM: RUN ON LOW TIRE PRESSURE (22 PSI INSTEAD OF INDICATED 35 PSI) FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE TIME I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE FROM THE DEALER TILL THAT I FOUND OUT THE PROBLEM.    REASON: THE DEALER (UNIVERSAL TOYOTA SAN ANTONIO) ADMITTED THAT THEY NEEDED TO LOWER THE TIRE PRESSURE OF THE VEHICLE DURING TRANSPORTATION FROM FACTORY TO DEALERSHIP BUT SOMEONE FORGOT TO SET IT BACK BEFORE IT WAS HANDED OUT TO CUSTOMER. THE MAINTENANCE DEALERSHIP (CAVENDER SAN ANTONIO) ALSO DIDN'T DO THEIR JOB TO CHECK THE TIRE PRESSURE UNTIL ONE YEAR LATER I ASKED THEM TO DO SO.     TOYOTA SOLUTION FOR THIS PROBLEM: THE MANAGER OF CAVENDER SAN ANTONIO PROMISED TO GIVE ME A FREE TANK OF GAS AND A FREE MAINTENANCE NEXT TIME. I ACCEPTED. HOWEVER, I ASKED THE DEALERSHIP TO REPLACE THE FOUR TIRES BECAUSE THEY WERE DAMAGED, BUT THEY DIDN'T AGREE, ARGUING THAT EVEN UNDER LOW PRESSURE, THESE TIRES SHOULD BE FINE.    CONSEQUENCES: THREE OF FOUR TIRES ON THIS VEHICLE WERE DEFLATED ON HIGHWAY IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR (3/22/2008, 9/6/2008, 3/20/2009). THE LAST TIRE DEFLATION WAS TERRIBLE AND ALMOST CAUSED FIVE LIVES ON THE VEHICLE BECAUSE IT WAS SUDDEN AND THE VEHICLE WAS LOST OF CONTROL. THE TIRE PRESSURE ALERT DIDN'T EVEN LIGHT UP AT THE BEGINNING. AFTER THIS ACCIDENT, I DECIDED THAT I CAN'T TAKE ANY CHANCE WITH THESE TIRES AND REPLACED ALL FOUR TIRES. I KEPT ALL THESE RECEIPTS.

I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER CAR WITH RUN-FLAT TIRES.  THEY DIDN'T TELL ME HOW EXPENSIVE THEY WERE TO REPLACE AND THAT I WOULD NEED TO REPLACE THEM SO FREQUENTLY.  ALSO THAT THE TIRE SENSOR IS INDIRECT.  I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHEN THE TIRES WERE JUST GETTING LOW, ONLY WHEN COMPLETELY FLAT. *TR",

ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS THE WHEELS WERE SPINNING WHEN WE TRIED TO DRIVE AFTER STOPPING AT THE STOP SIGN, AT TRAFFIC LIGHTS, OR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION. IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS MALFUNCTION, BECAUSE IT PREVENTS THE DRIVER FROM MERGING INTO OR ESCAPING FROM HEAVY TRAFFIC OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA. IT HAPPENED IN ALL KINDS OF WEATHER AND ROAD SURFACE CONDITIONS.    I AM A VERY CAREFUL DRIVER; I SPEND A LOT OF TIME DRIVING MY THREE YOUNG CHILDREN. I NEVER HAD AN ACCIDENT AND I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE SPINNING TIRES ON ANY OTHER CAR I HAVE DRIVEN. WE CONTACTED OUR DEALERSHIP AND TOYOTA COMPANY. THEIR FIRST RESPONSE WAS THAT IT IS NOT THEIR PROBLEM. AFTER OUR INTERVENTION THE DEALERSHIP AGREED TO DRIVE TEST OUR CAR. THE TEST WAS PERFORMED BY ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES (NOT CLEAR IF HE HAD ANY CAR SAFETY INSPECTION TRAINING). HE TOOK OUR CAR FOR A SHORT DRIVE AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD, ALONE, IN THE PERFECT WEATHER, REPORTING BACK THAT HE DID NOT NOTICE ANY PROBLEM.     THE TEST DRIVE WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. WE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR USUALLY WHEN THERE IS MORE THAN ONE PERSON IN THE CAR, DURING THE RAIN ETC; IN OTHER WORDS, IN AVERAGE DRIVING CONDITIONS. SINCE THE TEST WE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AGAIN, MANY TIMES.     I BELIEVE WE ARE NOT THE ONLY OWNERS OF SIENNA, WHO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. I OBSERVED IT SEVERAL TIMES ON THE STREET, WITH OTHER SIENNAS.

THIS MINIVAN HAS HAD 2 \"DEFECTIVE\" TIRES ON IT SINCE IT'S PURCHASE AND WITH LESS THAN 8000 MILES ON THE TIRES. BOTH TIRES WERE REPLACED BY THE DEALER, BUT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE TIRE/PRESSURE PROBLEMS. I BELIEVE BOTH TIRES WERE RUINED DUE TO THE PRESSURE SENSING SYSTEM NOT DETECTING LOW PRESSURE IN THE TIRES AND CAUSING THE SIDE WALLS TO COLLAPSE AFTER CONTINUED DRIVING. LUCKILY, NOBODY HAS BEEN INJURED, HOWEVER IF DRIVING AT HIGH SPEEDS WITH THIS SYSTEM A POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR A SEVERE ACCIDENT. I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE NATIONAL TOYOTA AND LOCAL DEALER, AND THEY CONTINUE TO NOT ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.  THE DEALER HAS STATED IN WRITING THAT THE PRESSURE SYSTEM IS FUNCTIONING PROPERLY, HOWEVER RUNFLAT TIRES ON THIS SYSTEM DO NOT REGISTER LOW PRESSURE UNTIL MULTIPLE TIRES OR A SINGLE TIRE HAS HARDLY ANY PRESSURE IN IT. THE LOCAL DEALER MANAGER AGREES WITH ME THAT THE RUNFLAT TIRES WITH THE ABS TYPE PRESSURE SENSING SYSTEM IS NOT A SAFE SYSTEM. I HAVE REQUESTED TO HAVE REGULAR TIRES INSTALLED ON THIS VAN SO THE PRESSURE SYSTEM CAN DETECT LOW PRESSURE, HOWEVER TOYOTA WILL NOT CHANGE THEM FOR ME. I FEEL THAT HAVING RUNFLATS AS INSTALLED BY THE MANUFACTURER ON THIS TYPE OF PRESSURE SYSTEM CAN EVENTUALLY LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT WHEN A LOW TIRE BLOWS OFF THE RIM AT A HIGH SPEED, CAUSING THE DRIVER TO LOSE CONTROL. WITH THE RUNFLAT TIRES, A DRIVER CANNOT VISUALLY LOOK AT THE TIRE AND DETECT THAT IT IS LOW, DUE TO THE THICK SIDEWALLS THAT ALLOW THEM TO \"RUN FLAT\". THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT I BELIEVE TOYOTA SHOULD ADDRESS AND CORRECT BEFORE SOMEBODY IS KILLED. I LIVE IN ALASKA AND MY MOTHER IN LAW FREQUENTLY MAKES TRIPS TO ANCHORAGE, WHERE FUEL/SERVICE STATIONS ARE HUNDREDS OF MILES APART AND -50F WEATHER IS COMMON. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL ME TO DISCUSS FURTHER AS THE LOCAL DEALER AND NATIONAL TOYOTA SEEM TO BE PASSING THIS OFF. THANK YOU.  REGARDS,  PETER MARVIN *TR",

THE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN ABOUT A MONTH LATER, BUT THE DEALER, BALISE TOYOTA IN WEST SPRINGFIELD, MA, RESET IT DURING AN OIL CHANGE.  IN MID OCTOBER, MY WIFE WAS BROADSIDED IN HER DOOR BY A HONDA CIVIC.  NONE OF THE AIRBAGS, INCLUDING THE SIDE CURTAIN AIRBAGS DEPLOYED.

THE DEALER'S SERVICE MANAGER TOLD US IN JANUARY THAT TOYOTA IN COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS, DESIGNED THE AIRBAGS TO PERMANENTLY TURN OFF IF A HEAVY PERSON RODE IN THE CAR. THE DEALERSHIP REFUSED TO TURN  THE  AIRBAGS BACK ON AGAIN, AND CLAIMED  THAT THERE  WAS NO  FIX FOR THIS BECAUSE IT WAS  INTENTIONAL.  OTHER DEALERS WANT TO CHARGE US FOR THIS, EVEN THOUGH IT SHOULD BE UNDER WARRANTY. LAST WEEK, A PERSON AT MOORE OF TOYOTA CUSTOMER CARE TOLD ME THAT THE COMPANY'S OFFICIAL POSITION WAS THAT THE AIRBAGS  WERE NOT BROKEN, BUT RATHER THAT MY WIFE AND I DID  NOT DESERVE THE PROTECTION BECAUSE OF OUR WEIGHT.
