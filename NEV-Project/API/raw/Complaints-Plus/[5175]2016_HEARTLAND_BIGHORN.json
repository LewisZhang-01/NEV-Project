Lippert Components is the manufacture of this suspension system. Lippert marketed this system called Correct Track and installed it across several brands of RV. I did a little research and found multiple failures. I notified Lippert of the failure and they open a case for me. I had a welder complete all repairs and Lippert has agreed to reimburse me for that cost.",
