THERE APPEAR TO BE HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS REGARDING SPONTANEOUS LARGE CRACKS ORIGINATING FROM THE PASSENGER SIDE DE-ICER AREA THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE NHTSA DATABASE FOR THIS ENTIRE GENERATION OF VEHICLES. PER SUBARU SERVICE BULLETIN 12-192-15R / NHTSA ID NUMBER: 10093903 (\"SERVICE BULLETIN\"), AN ALLEGEDLY IMPROVED WINDSHIELD WAS USED FOR THE LEGACY AND OUTBACK MODELS AFTER THE 2016 MODEL YEAR. HOWEVER, THE COMPLAINTS TO THE NHTSA AND CURRENT LEGAL ACTIONS SHOW THAT SUBARU HAS CONTINUED TO REFUSE TO HOLD ITS GLASS SUPPLIER ACCOUNTABLE FOR FAULTY WINDSHIELDS.     THE ORIGIN OF THE LARGE CRACK ON MY LEGACY'S WINDSHIELD IS ACTUALLY UNDERNEATH WHERE THE WIPER BLADE SITS AND AS SUCH COULD NOT HAVE ORIGINATED FROM A BULLS EYE, STAR, OR COMBINATION IMPACT WHILE DRIVING. MY VEHICLE IS STILL UNDER THE ORIGINAL BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY PERIOD. BASED ON THE LOCATION AND NATURE OF THE CRACK, I BELIEVE THIS ISSUE CORRESPONDS WITH THE WINDSHIELD PROBLEMS DESCRIBED IN THE SERVICE BULLETIN.

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
