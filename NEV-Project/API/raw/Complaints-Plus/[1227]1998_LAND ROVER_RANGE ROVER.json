AFTER HAVING THE RANGE ROVER FOR NEARLY FIVE MONTHS, IT INCURRED MAJOR PROBLEMS.  THE RANGE ROVER BROKE DOWN TWICE WITHIN A WEEK.  BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF EACH INCIDENT.  INCIDENT #1 FEBRUARY 5, 2003 AT ABOUT 8PM  I WAS DRIVING THE RANGE ROVER, HEADING HOME WHEN THE FIRST PROBLEMS AROUSE. THE RANGE ROVER  WAS OVER HEATING.  I NOTICED THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE READ HOT.  THEN THE STEERING BECAME VERY HARD.  WHEN I PULLED OVER, I NOTICED THE RANGE ROVER STARTED SMOKING FROM UNDER THE HOOD.  I THEN  GOT OUT OF THE RANGE ROVER AND NOTICED SOMETHING WAS DRIPPING UNDER THE BOTTOM OF THE TRUCK.  THE RANGE ROVER WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER. IT WAS ASSESSED THAT THE THERMOSTAT WAS THE PROBLEM.  THIS SERVICE WAS COMPLETED 2/10/03.  INCIDENT #2 FEBRUARY 15, 2003 AT ABOUT 2PM  MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING THE RANGE ROVER  TO WORK. WHILE DRIVING HE NOTICED THE RANGE ROVER STARTED TO ACT FUNNY. AT WHICH TIME HE NOTIFIED ME TO SEE IF IT WAS THE SAME THING THAT OCCURRED WHEN THE TRUCK BROKE DOWN THE FIRST TIME  AS HE WAS  PULLING OVER, THE RANGE ROVER SHUT DOWN COMPLETELY.  ON WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 19 THE RANGE ROVER WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER.  THE NEXT DAY, THE DEALERSHIP CALLED FOR OUR PERMISSION TO TAKE THE ENGINE APART SO THAT THE WARRANTY ADJUSTER FOR APCO, [XXX],  COULD ASSESS THE DAMAGE.  [XXX] MADE HIS ASSESSMENT AND THEN CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE DAMAGE WAS OUR FAULT. IT WAS SAID THAT MY HUSBAND DIDN'T PULL OVER FAST ENOUGH.  THEY SAID  THEY WOULD NOT PAY THE COST FOR THE ENTIRE ENGINE, BUT WILL OFFER A CONTRIBUTION, WHICH THE DEALERSHIP DOES NOT DO.
