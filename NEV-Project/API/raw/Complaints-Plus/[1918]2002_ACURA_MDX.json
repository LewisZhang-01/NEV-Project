THE RECALL STATED THAT ACURA WOULD EITHER INSTALL A JET PACK--IF THE VEHICLE HAD LESS THAN 15,000 MILES ON IT  OR IF IT HAD MORE THAN 15,000 MILES ON IT, THEY WOULD REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION. I SPOKE WITH [XXX] IN ACURA CUSTOMER RELATIONS AND HE LOOKED UP MY VIN AND SAID THAT HE DID SEE THE RECALL BUT THAT MY VEHICLE \"WAS INSPECTED AND NO ISSUES WERE FOUND\" IN 2005 AND DUE TO THAT INSPECTION THE RECALL WAS \"COMPLETED\". HOWEVER, I BROUGHT UP THE FACT THAT THE RECALL STATES THAT THEY WERE TO EITHER ADD A JET PACK (COOLER) IF THE VEHICLE WAS LESS THAN 15,000 MILES OR REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION IF THE VEHICLE HAD MORE THAN 15,000 MILES. HE THEN CHANGES HIS STORY AND SAID \"WELL THEN OF COURSE THE JET PACK WAS INSTALLED\". I GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH HIM AND POSTED TO ACURA'S FACEBOOK PAGE AS AT THIS POINT, I HAVE HEARD CONFLICTING STORIES. THEY HAD ANOTHER CUSTOMER RELATIONS PERSON CALL ME AND SHE GAVE ME THE NAME OF THE DEALERSHIP THAT DID THIS \"INSPECTION\" IN 2005. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THE SAME THING \"IT SHOWS THE RECALL WAS COMPLETED IN 2005 BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT WAS COMPLETED\". BASED ON THE CARFAX, THE VEHICLE HAD 18,000 MILES ON IT IN 2004. ACCORDING TO THE RECALL, SINCE IT SURPASSED THE 15K MARK, THEY SHOULD HAVE REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION IN 2005--NOT INSTALLED A JET PACK. IN ANY CASE, I ASKED THE SHOP MY CAR IS AT TO LOOK AND THEY SAID THERE IS NO JET PACK OR COOLER INSTALLED. THEY ALSO INFORMED ME THAT I NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION AND THAT THE CAR COULD HAVE LOCKED UP ON ME AND CAUSED A CRASH. THANK GOD THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN WITH MY KIDS IN THE CAR.

WE CONTACTED NIELLO ACURA OF SACRAMENTO AND THEY TOLD US TO BRING THE CAR TO THEM AND THEY WOULD SEE WHAT THEY CAN DO FOR US. THEY TOLD ME I WOULD HAVE TO PAY $5,500 FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION AND THEY WOULD NOT TAKE CARE OF THIS AS A SAFETY ISSUE. IF THIS HAPPENS TO SOMEONE ELSE, THEY MIGHT NOT BE AS LUCKY AS WE WERE. I WAS TOLD THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE (THE TRANSMISSION DOWNSHIFTING UNEXPECTEDLY). I ASKED THE ACURA DEALER ABOUT THIS AND THEY TOLD ME THE VEHICLE HAD ALREADY HAD THE FIX INSTALLED IN 2004.

ON 27 JULY, 2004 THE TRANSMISSION BEGAN TO ROCK FRONT AND BACK, WITH LOUD GRINDING AND METAL TO METAL SOUND. THE DEALER EXPLAINED THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE AT AND AN OIL JET COOLER WAS NEEDED.  OVER THE NEXT 7 YEARS I HAD MY MDX SERVICED AT THE DEALERSHIP. EACH TIME I WOULD COMPLAIN ABOUT THE NOISE AT SPEEDS BETWEEN 20-30 AND 35-45. AGAIN I WAS TOLD NOTHING COULD BE DONE. THE ENGINE BROKE THE SIDE MOTOR MOUNT, AGAIN I WAS TOLD THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE.   FINALLY ON 6 JULY 2011 WHILE DRIVING 75 ON INTERSTATE 71, MY TRANSMISSION REVVED INTO THE RED AREA ON THE GAUGE, ATF WAS BLOWING OUT THE BACK AND COVERED THE BACK WINDOW. I PULLED OVER AND THE TRANSMISSION SEIZED ON THE SPOT. THE MDX WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP WERE I WAS TOLD THE OIL JET COOLER HAD A DRAIN NUT, THAT CAME OUT, THUS RELEASING THE ATF. THE DRAIN PLUG AND ATF WAS REPLACED, BUT AGAIN I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING COULD BE DONE AS THE DEFECT WAS A PART AND NOT COVERED. THE SHOP MANAGER TOLD ME THAT THE SHOCK AND SPRING WAS RUSTED AND LEAKING FLUID. I WAS TOLD THAT BOTH MOTOR, THE TIMING BELT, THE SHIFTER CABLE AND CONNECTION, OUTER TIRE ROD, BOOTS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  I SEARCHED THE INTERNET FOR 5 MINUTES AND DISCOVERED THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS RELATED TO THE TRANSMISSION. I CONFIRMED THE RECALLS ON THE SHOCKS COILS TRANSMISSION, AND MULTITUDE OF OTHER COMPONENTS. I HAD THE TIMING BELT, EVERY BELT, WATER PUMP, AND MOTOR MOUNTS REPLACE AT ANOTHER DEALERSHIP IN TOWN.  THIS IS A DANGEROUS PROBLEM.

ALTHOUGH I WAS CONCERNED HOW ENGINE MOUNT FAILURES COULD HAPPEN ON A VEHICLE WITH THIS MILEAGE, I AGREED TO HAVE IT REPAIRED FOR OBVIOUS SAFETY REASONS.  LATER THAT DAY I DISCOVERED OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET FOR BROKEN ENGINE MOUNTS FOR THIS VEHICLE.  WHEN I ARRIVED AT JERRY DAMSON ACURA TO PICK IT UP, I ADVISED THE SERVICE PERSON THAT I FELT ACURA SHOULD PAY FOR THIS.  THE ACURA SERVICE MANAGER, GIL WILLIAMS, WAS CALLED-IN TO DISCUSS THIS PROBLEM WITH ME.  HE STATED THAT THEY/ACURA WOULD NOT PAY FOR THIS.  I ASKED HOW A FAILURE OF THIS NATURE COULD HAPPEN AT THIS MILEAGE.  AFTER SOME DISCUSSION HE STATED THAT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER IS LOCATED NEAR THESE PARTICULAR ENGINE MOUNTS AND CONTRIBUTES TO INCREASED TEMPERATURE IN THE AREA, RESULTING IN FAILURE OF THESE ENGINE MOUNTS.  HE FURTHER STATED THAT HE HAD PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED THIS PROBLEM WITH ACURA AND THEY ADVISED HIM TO 'SELL IT AS A MAINTENANCE ITEM'.  I STATED THIS WAS AN OBVIOUS DESIGN DEFECT THAT ACURA OR JERRY DAMSON SHOULD PAY FOR.  HE SAID THEY WOULD NOT.  I ASKED HIM TO ELEVATE THIS TO THE JERRY DAMSON GENERAL MANAGER.

THE LOCAL ACURA REPRESENTATIVE REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FAILURE OR CONSIDER REIMBURSEMENT FOR ANY DAMAGES.
