I TOOK THE CAR TO A NEARBY DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME THE SAME THING, THAT PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE  AND THEY WILL CONTACT ME WHEN THEY ARE. SO REALLY, I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR PARTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS. A LETTER I RECEIVED FROM FORD IN DECEMBER 2017 SUGGESTED THAT I NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO RIDE IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT UNTIL THE REPAIR WAS MADE!  SO I FEEL LIKE I AM RIDING AROUND IN A TIMEBOMB.  I HAD ALSO RECEIVED A LETTER FROM TAKATA THEMSELVES SEVERAL YEARS AGO, STATING THAT MY CAR WAS ALSO UNDER A RECALL FOR THE DRIVER SIDE AIRBAG INFLATOR AS WELL. HOWEVER I DO NOT HAVE THAT LETTER ANY LONGER - I THINK IT WAS LEFT AT A DEALER WHEN I ATTEMPTED AGAIN TO GET THE REPAIRS MADE.

CAR WAS IN GREAT SHAPE WHEN WE PARKED IT FOR THE 2 1/2 MONTHS, AND NOW I HAVE NO CAR FOR HIS APPTS.  WE ARE TRYING TO GET IT FIXED BUT I AM NOT SURE.HOW.  IT REALLY WIPED US OUT WORRYING ABOUT HOW WE ARE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS.  ON TOP OF THAT THE PAINT CHIPS OFF IN CHUNKS AND BOTH FRONT DOOR HANDLES ARE BROKEN.  THIS IS THE CRAPPIEST CAR I HAVE EVER HAD.  NOT TO MENTION THAT THE MOTOR MOUNTS MIGHT ALSO HAVE CAUSED THE PROBLEM.  THEY ARE TERRIBLE AND IN TERRIBLE SHAPE NOW.

FOUND OUT WHAT THE ISSUE IS WITH THE AISIN TRANSMISSIONS SLIPPING WHICH WERE USED IN THE 2006 FUSION.  IT IS DUE TO VALVE BORE WEAR IN THE MAIN CONTROL. IF THE TRANS FLUID ISNT BURNT (MEANING THERE IS INTERNAL TRANS CLUTCH DAMAGE) THEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT $800-$1000 TO REPLACE THE MAIN CONTROL. IF THE CLUTCHES ARE BURNT THE WHOLE TRANS WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED COST??? SOMETHING LIKE $4000-$5000. THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN FORD BOUGHT THE AISIN TRANS, FORD DID NOT BUY THE SERVICE RIGHTS. SO THERE ARE NO SERVICE PARTS AVAILABLE OR TRAINING AVAIL ON HOW TO SERVICE THIS TRANS. THE ISSUE WITH THE MAIN CONTROL HAS BEEN SO COMMON THAT AISIN HAS AGREED TO SUPPLY FORD WITH SERVICE MAIN CONTROLS.THERE HAS BEEN A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN OUT THERE.

I HAVE READ OF OTHER PEOPLE IN EARLIER MODEL CARS FROM AS EARLY AS 2005 POSTING ON FORUMS THAT THEY HAD THE SAME ISSUE, SO I BELIEVE THIS WASN'T ONLY A PROBLEM ON 2009'S AND LATER. FORD ISSUES AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE FUSION OF TEN YEARS OR 150,000 MILES. I DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF THE SPECIFIC RECALL OTHER THAN A REFERENCE TO CONSUMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM 13N03. THE PROBLEM SOMETIMES IS REFERRED AS THE \"LIMP HOME\" MODE. IN CONCLUSION, I WOULD LIKE OUR 2006 FORD FUSION TO BE INCLUDED OR QUALIFIED IN THE RECALL SO I CAN FIX THIS PROBLEM OR AT LEAST GET REIMBURSED ONCE I GET IT FIXED SINCE IT IS A DEFECT WITH THE CAR.",

TOOK THE CAR TO THE NEAREST FORD GARAGE AND WAS TOLD THE HCU WAS PROBABLY OUT AND WOULD COST $2000 TO FIX IT. I TOLD THEM I NEEDED TO THINK ABOUT IT. THEY CALLED BACK LATER AND SAID THEY BLED THE BRAKES AND THAT FIXED THE PROBLEM SO NO REPAIR WAS DONE. THE BRAKES DID THE SAME THING A FEW MONTHS LATER WHEN BRAKING HARD TO AVOID HITTING A CAR WHICH HAD PULLED OUT IN FRONT OF ME. AFTER READING COMMENTS ONLINE, I FIXED THE ISSUE BY DRIVING AT 25 MPH IN A PARKING LOT AND THEN SLAMMING ON THE BRAKES. THE BRAKES WORK NORMALLY AFTER THAT. I'M SURE THIS IS ONLY A TEMPORARY FIX AND I KNOW THE MODEL YEARS 2007 - 2009 ARE BEING INVESTIGATED FOR THIS ISSUE.

WHEN I STARTED THE CAR BACK UP THE LIGHTS WERE OFF ON THE DASHBOARD AND THE CAR SEEMED TO RUN FINE. I DID NOT HAVE ANOTHER INCIDENT UNTIL 2014.

IT WAS ALSO BEING SAID THAT THIS PART WAS DEFECTIVE AND THAT FORD HAD ISSUED A 10 YEAR EXTENDED WARRANTY (FROM TIME OF PURCHASE) ON THE PART. AGAIN, AFTER STARTING THE CAR THE NEXT DAY IT WAS RUNNING FINE, NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT OR ANY OTHER LIGHTS ON. IT RAN FINE UNTIL JUNE 2015.

I WAS CALLED THAT DAY AND TOLD THAT FORD WOULD NOT BE COVERING THE THROTTLE BODY BECAUSE MY VIN# WAS NOT ONE LISTED. I QUESTIONED THIS BECAUSE THE INFORMATION I FOUND REGARDING THE WARRANTY FOR THE PART DIDN'T MENTION SPECIFIC VINS ONLY. THE SERVICE PERSON STATED THAT THEY WOULD FIX IT BUT ONLY IF I PAID FOR THE THROTTLE BODY PART AND LABOR.

IT WAS ALSO BEING SAID THAT THIS PART WAS DEFECTIVE AND THAT FORD HAD ISSUED A 10 YEAR EXTENDED WARRANTY (FROM TIME OF PURCHASE) ON THE PART. AGAIN, AFTER STARTING THE CAR THE NEXT DAY IT WAS RUNNING FINE, NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT OR ANY OTHER LIGHTS ON. IT RAN FINE UNTIL JUNE 2015. AT THIS POINT I HAD HAD ENOUGH AND CALLED THE FORD DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR. MIND YOU, MY CAR ONLY HAS 51K ORIGINAL MILES. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT AND DROPPED IT OFF ON JUNE 24TH, 2015. I WAS CALLED THAT DAY AND TOLD THAT FORD WOULD NOT BE COVERING THE THROTTLE BODY BECAUSE MY VIN# WAS NOT ONE LISTED. I QUESTIONED THIS BECAUSE THE INFORMATION I FOUND REGARDING THE WARRANTY FOR THE PART DIDN'T MENTION SPECIFIC VINS ONLY. THE SERVICE PERSON STATED THAT THEY WOULD FIX IT BUT ONLY IF I PAID FOR THE PART AND LABOR.

HE ORDERED A NEW ONE, BUT WHEN IT ARRIVED HE CALLED TO TELL ME THAT IT WASN'T WHAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS. HE LET ME KEEP THE NEW SWITCH FREE OF CHARGE SINCE HE WASN'T ABLE TO HELP ME AT ALL. I HAD TO WALK TO THE SHOP TO PICK UP MY CAR BECAUSE MY MECHANIC WAS JUST AS BAFFLED AS I WAS. SINCE SOMEONE WHO WENT TO SCHOOL FOR THIS KIND OF STUFF COULDN'T HELP ME, I FIGURED I WOULD GOOGLE THE ISSUE TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY ANSWERS OUT THERE. I FOUND WEBSITES FULL OF PEOPLE HAVING SIMILAR ISSUES.

AFTER MUCH RESEARCH ONLINE AND SPEAKING TO CERTIFIED MECHANICS I AM SURE FORD IS WELL AWARE OF THE PROBLEM THAT EXISTS WITH THE IGNITION COILS EXPLODING DUE TO A COMPUTER MALFUNCTION. THIS CAUSES THE CAR TO STOP. MY CAR HAPPENED TO STOP WHILE I WAS ON THE FREEWAY. I WON'T GO INTO A LOT OF DETAIL BUT IT WAS SCARY AND COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY COST ME MY LIFE. FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY COAST TO THE SHOULDER AND WAIT FOR AAA TO COME TO MY RESCUE. I TOOK MY CAR TO A MECHANIC WHO GOT THE CAR RUNNING AGAIN AFTER REPLACING TWO IGNITION COILS AND MY SPARK PLUGS, BUT IT BROKE DOWN AGAIN ON THE WAY HOME FROM THE MECHANIC. AGAIN, THE CAR JUST SHUTS OFF WITHOUT WARNING, BUT THIS TIME I WAS LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC WAITING FOR AAA. MY CAR IS NOW AT THE FORD DEALERSHIP AND THE BILL IS REALLY HIGH. BOTH, MY MECHANIC AND THE FORD SERVICE TECHNICIAN CONFIRMED THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE COMPUTER THAT IS CAUSING IGNITION COILS TO \"BURN UP\" OR \"EXPLODE\". I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS AN 8 YEAR OR 80,000 MILE WARRANTY WITH COVERS THIS ISSUE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY I AM OVER THE 8 YEARS (BUT STILL 15,000 UNDER THE MILEAGE).  THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL. SOMEONE COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE THEIR LIFE BECAUSE FORD CHOOSES TO OVERLOOK THIS TICKING TIME BOMB. I AM NOW HAVING TO SPEND $2200 TO REPAIR THIS ISSUE WHEN FORD SHOULD BE THE ONE COVERING THE COST TO MAKE IT RIGHT.   *TR",

THE ENGINE RPM INCREASED AS I TRIED TO GET THE VEHICLE TO MOVE OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. AFTER SHUTTING THE CAR OFF AND RESTARTING IT WAS ABLE TO GET ME HOME. THE NEXT TIME I DROVE IT, IT WAS FINE FOR A WHILE AND DID IT AGAIN. TOOK IT TO THE FORD DEALER AND WAS TOLD IT NEEDED AN NEW TRANSMISSION CONTROL VALVE BODY. I ASKED IF THERE HAD BEEN PROBLEMS WITH THIS TRANSMISSION IN OTHER FUSIONS AND THEY SAID NONE THAT THEY KNEW OF.   IN LOOKING ON THE INTERNET I FIND THAT THIS TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR MANY PEOPLE FROM THE YEARS 2005-2010. CHECK SERVICE BULLETIN PUT OUT BY FORD # 08-24-1 PUBLICATION DATE NOV. 13 2008. I AM SURE THERE ARE OTHER SERVICE BULLETINS ALSO. MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD THEIR VEHICLE STOP ON A VERY BUSY HIGHWAY AND HAVE BEEN PUT IN DANGER BECAUSE OF THE ABOVE PROBLEM.

I PUSHED THE GAS PEDAL AND GOT THE CAR TO VERY SLOWLY ACCELERATE AND MOVE WITHOUT SHIFTING BUT CATCHING SPEED. ONCE THE CAR WAS MOVING AT 60 MPH THERE WEREN'T ANY PROBLEMS, BUT IF I HAD TO SLOW DOWN OR COME TO A STOP THE CAR WOULD TAKE FOREVER TO BEGIN CATCHING SPEED. I WAS ABLE TO GET US TO A SAFE PLACE 25 MINS AWAY AND PARKED THE CAR UNTIL THE NEXT DAY. BECAUSE IT WAS A SMALL TOWN AND A SATURDAY THERE WERE NO MECHANICS AVAILABLE UNTIL MONDAY. I HAD TO STAY THE WEEKEND WAITING FOR A MECHANIC. WHILE WAITING I DID A GOOGLE SEARCH AND DISCOVERED THE HORRIFYING FACT THAT FORD IS FULLY AWARE OF THIS ISSUE CAUSED BY THEM PURCHASING TRANSMISSIONS WITH FAULTY VALVE'S.

THE NOISE IN MOST CASES WILL ONLY LAST FOR A FEW ROTATIONS OF THE WHEELS AND THEN GO AWAY.

FORD SHOULD STOP THIS ON GOING ISSUE BY ANNOUNCING A RECALL.  I AM SURE MANY OTHERS WILL AGREE.

FIRST, I DON'T LIKE THE TILT IN THE CAR...VERY DIFFICULT TO USE IF YOU HAVE ARTHRITIS.  I DON'T LIKE THAT THERE AREN'T ANY BACK SEAT LIGHTS FOR WHOMEVER IS BACK THERE.  I HAD PROBLEMS WITH MY STEERING SHAKING & BROUGHT THE CAR IN TO THE DEALER...THEY ENDED UP TURNING THE ROTORS.  THINGS WENT WELL FOR ABOUT A WEEK THEN IT WENT BACK TO THE SAME.  THEY ENDED UP TURNING THEM AGAIN...NO CHARGE..BUT NO REAL EXPLANATION AS TO WHY IT WAS HAPPENING.  ONE MONTH LATER IT HAPPENED AGAIN & THIS TIME WE DECIDED TO JUST BUY NEW ROTORS ON OUR OWN & REPLACE THE PADS TOO.  THE INTERIOR DOOR HANDLE IN THE BACK SEAT BROKE & THE FINISH OFF THE DRIVERS INTERIOR DOOR IS BUBBLING TOO...THIS SHOULDN'T HAPPEN IN A 2 YEAR OLD CAR!  NOW, THE OTHER DAY MY A/C DECIDED NOT TO BLOW COLD AIR ANYMORE & THE PART IS ON BACK ORDER UNTIL THE END OF JULY!!  HOW CAN THIS BE WITH SUCH A POPULAR CAR & SUCH A NEW CAR.  I REALLY LOVE THIS CAR BUT I FEEL THAT MY OLDER VEHICLES LASTED LONGER WITH FEWER PROBLEMS.  I AM PAST MY WARRANTY SO WHATEVER GOES WRONG I HAVE TO GET HELP FROM MY HUSBAND & HIS MECHANIC FRIENDS IN ORDER TO SAVE SOME MONEY BECAUSE THE DEALER WANTS TO CHARGE 4X'S THE AMOUNT WHICH I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE A PROFIT BUT AT THE SAME TIME MOST PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD SUCH PRICES.

SINCE THE TIRES ARE MADE IN THE USA AND FORD IS A US BRAND, I WOULD LIKE TO FILE THIS COMPLAINT. I HAVE PLENTY OF PICTURES I MIGHT SEND TO YOU IN CASE YOU NEED THEM.   I HAVE CALLED MICHELIN, BECAUSE THIS IS A BRAND NEW TIRE, SO THERE IS NO TIRES ON ANY DEALER, AND ALSO, TO ASK THEM TO HONOR THE WARRANTY BUT IT SEEMS THAT NO ONE WANTS TO HELP OUT AND THEY SAY IT MUST BE MY FAULT AND NOT MICHELINS FAULT SINCE THEIR TIRE HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH TYPE OF PROBLEM.
