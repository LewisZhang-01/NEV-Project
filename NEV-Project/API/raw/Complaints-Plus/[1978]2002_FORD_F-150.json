So, I've come to the conclusion I must move on. Then I realized I really cannot sell the vehicle? Somebody would be killed no doubt. I've been lucky and savvy enough to slide the shifter into neutral. If I sell the truck and do not mention the problem? The thing is I could sell this truck in 5 minutes. It runs like a top spins. I have always taken care of any maintenance issues since purchasing new.  I've educated myself on SUA. It's extremely interesting but if you've experienced it, it is awful. I read one story about a guy who wanted a Toyota dealership to take his Camry back. It was practically new. They would not. So he went to another dealership and traded it in. I can't blame the guy but I can not sell my truck and sleep at night. So what do I do with a truck that roars off like a rocket ship? How many people have had this problem? And what do they do with the car/truck once they realize it really cannot be driven anymore?",

I kicked gas pedal although gas peddle was not depressed. It stopped. I was shook up but in control. I decided to remove throttle body and clean extensively. Replaced TB  Sensor w/ genuine Ford part and replaced throttle valve on top. Hoped for the best. Still have the problem. 2002 F 150 XL 4.2 purchased new. I still have truck because its been such a great truck, I never felt like it was time to move on. It runs like new and I've taken care of it. I am writing this info for safety and only safety. I've been researching this issue. trying to solve problem. I took truck to qualified shop where mechanic is known to me and he was a little stumped. No codes, no check engine light. Can't solve the puzzle? So, I'm on top of the possibility of it happening. I really don't go anywhere w/ truck, to the store and back pretty much. So when its happens, I'm fast to go to neutral. I also feel like if I wanted to show somebody what I'm talking about, all they have to do is get in. I'm almost positive if I punch the gas peddle just a little, say to pass a slow driver, it'll go like hell. I have started thinking about my next truck. But no way I'm trading or selling this truck and passing the problem to someone else.  So, I'm dealing with it and really hope my experience helps. I've read the story's on line. Because I've lived it, I can tell you its a bit terrifying.  That's my story Thank You Jim Winn",

LATE DEC, 2016, EARLY JAN, 2017 WHILE PARKED, WE DISCOVERED THE BRAKE LIGHTS AND ONE TURN SIGNAL LIGHT NO LONGER WORKED..THE HIGH MOUNT BRAKE LIGHT WAS A BAD BULB, BUT WHEN A CHECK OF FUSES AND BULBS FOR THE OTHER LIGHTS WERE FOUND TO BE OK, WE DECIDED THE BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH WAS BAD.  WRONG !  MORE RESEARCH POINTED THE PROBLEM TO THE MULTI FUNCTION/COMBINATION SWITCH OR ITS CONNECTIONS, ACTUAL PROBLEM WAS THE CONNECTIONS ON THE MFS. NUMEROUS REFERRALS TO THIS PROBLEM FOR MANY FORD YEAR MODELS ARE POSTED ON THE INTERNET AS WELL AS SEVERAL VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE.COM.  INSPECTION REVEALED THAT SEVERAL WIRES GOING TO THE MFS HAD PULLED OUT OF THE CONNECTOR WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL WAS LOWERED. CONNECTOR WAS DAMAGED BY THIS ACTION. WIRE CABLE GOING TO THE MFS IS FIXED SOLID TO THE STEERING COLUMN, AND THERE IS NOT ENOUGH SLACK IN THE WIRES TO ALLOW THE STEERING WHEEL TO BE LOWERED ALL THE WAY WITHOUT CAUSING THE PULLED WIRES AND DAMAGED CONNECTOR.  PROBLEM WAS REPAIRED BY AN INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOP AT OWNERS EXPENSE SINCE THE TRUCK WAS HAZARDOUS, UNSAFE, AND ILLEGAL TO DRIVE WITH NO BRAKE LIGHTS AND PARTIAL TURN SIGNALS.  DRIVING WITHOUT THESE LIGHTS, ESPECIALLY IN NE OHIO IN THE WINTER SNOW STORMS - I DON'T THINK SO !!  COST OF REPAIRS:SEE FORWARDED INVOICE.

WENT OVER TO THE TRUCK TO MAKE SURE IT WAS TURNED OFF AND NOT LEFT ON BY MISTAKE BUT THE ENGINE WAS OFF. SO I BROUGHT THE TRUCK INTO THE WORK SHOP TO HAVE A LOOK OVER THE VEHICLE AND DID SOME DIAGNOSTICS ON IT AND DISCOVERED MULTIPLE DEFECT CODES THAT ALL CONNECT THROUGH THE GEM(GENERAL ELECTRICAL MODULE) ON THE INTERIOR FUSE PANEL. UPON FURTHER INSPECTION I ALSO NOTICED BOTH THE GEM AND FUSE PANEL BOX HAVE GOT WATER INGESTION AND GREEN/BROWN STAINS COMING OUT THE BOTTOM. I HAVE DONE RESEARCH ONLINE ABOUT THESE'S ISSUES AND ITS A COMMON PROBLEM OVER MODELS FROM FORD FROM 98-03. THE FIX IS TO REPLACE THE GEM AND FUSE BOX AND TO RESEAL/REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD.

AT THAT TIME THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THE KEY WAS THE PROBLEM AND I PAID FOR A NEW KEY AND EVERYTHING HAS BEEN GOOD UNTIL ~ 1/4/15.  THIS TIME,  THE PATS (ANTI-THEFT) SYSTEM TRIGGERED AND RENDERED THE VEHICLE USELESS.  AFTER ~ 45 MINUTES IT EVENTUALLY STARTED AND I DROVE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP.  IT WAS THERE FOR 2 DAYS AND THEY COULDN'T GET THE SYSTEM TO TRIGGER.  THEREFORE, THEY HAD ME COME PICK UP THE VEHICLE.  TWO DAYS LATER, THE VEHICLE RENDERED ITSELF USELESS AGAIN THROUGH THE PATS SYSTEM.  THE VEHICLE WOULDN'T START FOR 2 DAYS AS I TRIED TO START IT PERIODICALLY AS I WAS INSTRUCTED BY THE DEALERSHIP.   FINALLY IT STARTED ON THE 3RD MORNING.  WHEN I ORIGINALLY TOOK THE TRUCK IN THE TWO GUYS AT THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM IN THIS YEAR MODEL.  IN FACT WHEN I TOLD HIM OF THE ISSUE I WAS HAVING, THE SERVICE MANAGER ASKED IF I HAD A 2002 F150.  WE HAD A GOOD LAUGH WHEN I SAID \"YES, AND THAT ISN'T A GOOD SIGN THAT YOU KNOW THAT- WITHOUT SEEING MY VEHICLE.\"  HE EXPLAINED THAT THE TILT MECHANISM IN THE STEERING COLUMN DAMAGES THE WIRE THAT RUNS FROM THE KEY TRANSPONDER AREA TO THE SENDING UNIT THAT TELLS THE ENGINE THAT THIS IS THE CORRECT KEY.  THIS WAS THE NIGHT THAT THEY KEPT THE TRUCK FOR 2 DAYS.  THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE A PERFECT OPERATIONAL VEHICLE IS NOT FUNCTIONING BECAUSE OF A CHAFFED WIRE OR THE WIRE HAS BEEN PULLED FROM ITS SOLDERING POINT.  I AM THE OWNER, YET I HAVE THE SAME CHANCE OF STARTING THAT TRUCK AS A CAR THIEF.  IT MAKES NO SENSE.   THIS DIDN'T SEEM LIKE A SAFETY ISSUE TO ME UNTIL I WAS STRANDED FOR 45 MINUTES IN A PARKING LOT AND IT WAS EXTREMELY COLD.  I ENVISIONED SOMEONE TURNING THEIR CAR/TRUCK OFF FOR SOME REASON IN A PLACE WHERE THE TEMP WAS WELL BELOW FREEZING AND FREEZING TO DEATH BECAUSE THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN TRIGGERED.  *TR",

THE TRANSMISSION LIGHT CAME ON BUT WHEN I PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR NOTHING HAPPENED.  THE ENGINE WAS STILL RUNNING BUT THE TRUCK WOULD NOT GO.  I WAS IN THE LEFT LANE INTENDING TO GO SOUTH ON 81 WITH A BARRIER ON MY LEFT AND NO SHOULDER TO ESCAPE TRAFFIC. I SIGNALED AND DRIFTED OVER TO THE RIGHT AND ENDED UP STOPPING IN AN AREA BETWEEN THE RT 81 LANE AND AN EXIT RAMP.  WHILE DOING THIS I HAD SLOWED CONSIDERABLY AS THE TRUCK HAD NO POWER AND CARS AND TRUCKS BEHIND ME HAD TO SWERVE AND BRAKE ABRUPTLY TO AVOID STRIKING ME.  THE AREA WHERE I FINALLY CAME TO REST WAS DIRECTLY BETWEEN THE TWO LANES WITHOUT ROOM ON EITHER SIDE.  I ATTEMPTED TO EXIT THE TRUCK TO TRY TO EVALUATE THE SITUATION BUT TRAFFIC WAS TRAVELING WITHIN A FOOT OR TWO OF THE TRUCK.   I CONTACTED AAA AND HAD TO WAIT IN THIS VERY HAZARDOUS POSITION FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES FOR A TOW TRUCK TO ARRIVE.  I HAD TO BE TOWED ALMOST 200 MILES TO MY HOME AFTER MY MECHANIC DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM HE STATED THAT IT WAS ONE OF OR POSSIBLY TWO SENSORS THAT HAD FAILED.  THESE SENSORS CONTROLLED THE FUEL AND AIR FLOW TO THE ENGINE AND WHEN THEY FAILED IT REFUSED TO ALLOW THE ENGINE TO ACCELERATE NOT ALLOWING ME TO MOVE THE TRUCK.  I FEEL THAT FORD SHOULD BE MADE TO DESIGN A SENSOR THAT PROVIDES A WARNING OR A MEANS TO OVERRIDE THE SYSTEM IN ORDER FOR A DRIVER TO MAKE IT TO A POINT OF SAFETY.  THIS SITUATION MIMICKED THE SAME SITUATION CAUSED BY GM CARS HAVING THEIR IGNITION SHUT OFF CAUSING DEATH AND SERIOUS INJURIES.  I JUST HAPPENED TO BE VERY LUCK AS I NARROWLY MISSED BE STRUCK BY FAST MOVING TRACTOR TRAILERS AND CARS.  HOPEFULLY SOMETHING CAN BE DONE BY FORD TO CORRECT THIS DANGEROUS SITUATION.  MY WIFE AND I FEEL VERY LUCKY TO BE HOME SAFE TODAY.   *TR",

THE SLIDE BOLTS THAT ALLOW THE CALIPER TO MOVE HAVE SEIZED CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO PULL VERY HARD TO ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD. IN MY CASE I WAS TOWING A 20' COMMERCIAL LANDSCAPE TRAILER EQUIPPED WITH DUAL AXLE TRAILER BRAKES. I APPROACHED A TRAFFIC LIGHT AND PROCEEDED TO MAKE A LEFT TURN GOING A SPEED OF APPROXIMATELY 15 TO 20 MPH WHEN I PRESSED THE BRAKE DURING THE TURN THE TRUCK PULLED EXTREMELY HARD TO THE LEFT RESULTING IN MY TRAILER JACK KNIFING INTO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TRUCK CAUSING MAJOR DAMAGE TO MY BED AND REAR WHEEL ON MY TRUCK. LATER AFTER INVESTIGATING THE CAUSE OF THE SUDDEN PULL FOUND THAT THE LEFT BRAKE CALIPER MOUNTING BRACKET HAD ONE OF THE BOLTS SEIZED WHILE THE OTHER WAS MOVING PROPERLY ALLOWING THE BRAKE TO MOVE A LITTLE BUT NOT PROPERLY CAUSING THE BRAKE TO DRAG AGAINST THE ROTOR ON THE INNER BRAKE PAD. WHEN THE BRAKE IS PRESSED THE PRESSURE PULLS THE TRUCK TO THE LEFT EXTREMELY HARD. REPLACING THE SLIDE BOLTS AND THE BRAKE CALIPER MOUNTING BRACKET FIXED THIS ISSUE AND I HAVEN'T HAD ANY ISSUES AFTER REPLACEMENT.  I KNOW THIS MAY BE A LITTLE HARD TO UNDERSTAND AS MY DESCRIPTION MAY NOT BE THE BEST, BUT THE UPPER BRAKE CALIPER BOLT WAS SEIZED WHILE THE LOWER BOLT WAS MOVING FREELY, WHEN THE BRAKE PEDDLE WAS PRESSED CAUSED THE LEFT BRAKE CALIPER TO GRAB HARDER THAN THE RIGHT SIDE CAUSING THE TRUCK TO PULL EXTREMELY HARD TO THE LEFT. THE TRAILER BRAKE WAS SET ON 7 AT THE TIME AND WORKED PROPERLY. THE TRUCK PULLED SO HARD TO THE LEFT CAUSED THE TRAILER TO BE AT SUCH A TIGHT ANGLE IT BEGAN TO SLIDE AND WHEN I REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING IT WAS TO LATE TO CORRECT IT. THE BED IS STILL DAMAGED FROM THIS. BTW I BOUGHT MY FORD IN 2002 BRAND NEW WITH 5.4 V8 AND I AM AT 271,000 MILES AND IT RUNS LIKE THE DAY I PURCHASED IT! I LOVE IT!  *TR",

I RE-STARTED THE VEHICLE AND HEARD A VERY LOUD AND RAPID \"POPPING\" SOUND FROM UNDERNEATH THE HOOD, WHICH BECAME WORSE AS I ACCELERATED. THE VEHICLE WAS ALSO SHAKING VIOLENTLY AS I ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE HOME, WHICH WAS ONLY 1 MILE AWAY FROM WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. WHEN I ARRIVED HOME I INSPECTED THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THAT THE 2ND SPARK PLUG IN ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE ENGINE (#6 CYLINDER) WAS BLOWN COMPLETELY OUT OF THE ENGINE HEAD. I CONTACTED MY LOCAL FORD DEALER THE NEXT MORNING AND WAS TOLD TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT. SHORTLY AFTER ARRIVING, I WAS INFORMED THAT \"BLOWN SPARK PLUGS\" ARE A VERY COMMON ISSUE WITH THE FORD TRITON 4.6 AND 5.4 LITRE ENGINES. I WAS ADVISED THAT THE SPARK PLUG HOLE WOULD HAVE TO BE RE-TAPPED AND A HELI-COIL KIT INSTALLED. THIS WORK WAS PERFORMED ON 06/08/2012 WITH A TOTAL COST TO ME OF $449.81, NOT INCLUDING THE COST OF THE TOW. I WAS ADVISED BY THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT FORD HAD ISSUED THE FIRST OF SEVERAL TSB'S (TECHNICAL SAFETY BULLETINS) TO ALL OF IT'S SERVICE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE US IN MARCH OF 2006 INFORMING THEIR TECHNICIANS OF THE DEFECT IN THE ENGINE'S ALUMINUM HEAD AND THE INCREASING FREQUENCY OF THIS \"BLOWN SPARK PLUG\" ISSUE. INCLUDED IN THIS TSB WERE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO REPAIR BY USING A HELI-COIL, WHICH IS NOT A FORD PART, NOT COVERED UNDER ANY WARRANTY AND NOT GUARANTEED TO STAY IN PLACE. A RECALL NEEDS TO BE ISSUED. PLEASE SEE THE LINK; I AM ONE OF THOUSANDS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS ISSUE AND I FEEL THAT THOSE OF US WHO HAVE INCURRED UNNECESSARY COSTS DUE TO FORD'S DEFECT SHOULD BE MADE WHOLE.

THREE WEEKS AGO I BEGAN TO HEAR AN ODD METALLIC SOUND FROM THE BACK OF THE TRUCK WHILE GOING OVER BUMPS IN THE ROAD. I CLIMBED UNDERNEATH AND GRASPED DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE SUSPENSION AND DRIVE TRAIN AND PUSHED AND PULLED ON THEM EXPECTING TO FIND SOMETHING LOOSE. I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING.       THE NEXT DAY I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND I HEARD A VERY LOUD BOOM!  I PULLED OVER AND AGAIN LOOKED AT THE REAR END OF THE TRUCK AND FOUND THAT THE MOUNT THAT HOLDS THE REAR LEAF SPRING TO THE FRAME BODY HAD BROKEN RATHER VIOLENTLY AND SENT THE END OF THE SPRING WITH HALF OF THE MOUNT THRU THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TRUCK BED.  I WAS ABLE TO LIMP HOME.  I BROUGHT THE TRUCK TO THE LOCAL BODY/ FRAME SHOP AND THE OWNER TOLD ME THAT HE HAS BEEN SEEING ALOT OF THESE LATELY AND IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM.  AFTER INSPECTION HE FOUND THE OTHER SIDE WAS EQUALLY RUSTED AND READY TO LET GO, WHICH CONCERNED ME SINCE THAT IS THE SIDE WITH THE GAS TANK ON IT.  IN HIS EXPERT OPINION HE BELIEVES THAT FORD HAD UNDERBUILT THE LEAF SPRING MOUNTS AND THAT IS WHY THEY ARE BEGINING TO FAIL ON TRUCKS THAT ARE AROUND THE AGE OF MINE.  THE FRAME IS SAFE AND SOLID ENOUGH BUT THE MOUNTS FOR PARTS OF THE SUSPENSION APPEAR NOT TO BE.  I AM FORTUNATE THAT I WAS NOT TOWING MY BOAT, OR THAT THE BED WAS NOT LOADED AND I WAS NOT DRIVING MORE THAN 35 MPH WHEN THE MOUNT LET GO.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IF I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY AT 65 MPH.        THE REPAIR COST $659 AND IN MY OPINION IT IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE FAILED CONSIDERING THE AGE, CONDITION AND THE LOW MILES I HAVE ON THE TRUCK.

IT IS SERVICED REGULARLY AND IS USED FOR ROUTINE DRIVING.  I HAPPENED TO BE 30 MILES FROM HOME WHEN I HEARD A LOUD TAPPING COMING FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  KNOWING A LITTLE ABOUT ENGINES I CHECKED TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND NOTICED THAT THE SPARK PLUG HAD BEEN PUSHED OUT OF THE CYLINDER HEAD, CAUSING THE COMPRESSION TO CAUSE IT AND THE COIL PACK TO CONTINUALLY STRIKE THE FUEL RAIL.  FORTUNATELY I KNEW A MECHANIC IN THE AREA 1/4 MILE FROM MY LOCATION AND SLOWLY DROVE TO HIS SHOP.  HE SAID THAT IT WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH FORD 4.6, 5.4 AND 6.8 TRITON ENGINES.  HE ADDED THAT THE ALUMINUM USED FOR THE HEADS WAS TOO SOFT CAUSING THE SPARK PLUGS TO SPIT OUT.  THERE WAS NO WAY OF PREVENTING THIS FROM HAPPENING OR PREDICTING WHEN IT WOULD HAPPEN.  THE HOLE FOR THIS SPARK PLUG HAD ALL THE TREADS BLOWN OUT WHEN THE PLUG CAME OUT SO I HAD TO LEAVE MY TRUCK AT THE GARAGE FOR REPAIR.  THE REPAIR CONSISTED OF HAVING TO PUT A STEEL THREADED INSERT INTO THE HEAD IN ORDER TO SECURE THE NEW SPARK PLUG / COIL PACK.  THE MECHANIC STATED THAT I SHOULD DEFINITELY NOT DRIVE IT SINCE IT COULD CAUSE A FIRE.  I COULD SMELL THE GAS FUMES FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND FULLY BELIEVE THIS TO BE A GOOD POSSIBILITY.  I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IF SOMEONE WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH ENGINES AND CONTINUED TO DRIVE WITH THIS CONDITION WITH THE POSSIBLE RESULT OF A FIRE IN THE VEHICLE WHILE THEIR FAMILY IS ABOARD.  I THINK FORD NEEDS TO DO A RECALL ON THESE ENGINES TO HAVE THEM REPAIRED IN A SAFE FASHION TO PREVENT A TRAGEDY OF A FIRE WHILE IN OPERATION.  UPON A GOOGLE SEARCH OF THIS TOPIC IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THERE ARE A MULTITUDE OF THE SAME TYPE OF INCIDENTS WITH THESE ENGINES.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. *TR",

I STARTED PUSHING ON THE GAS PEDAL, TO SEE IF I COULD LOOSEN IT, WHILE THE TRUCK REMAINED OFF. I TURNED IT BACK ON FOR THE SECOND TIME AND IT WAS RUNNING NORMAL AGAIN. I HESITATED PUT IT BACK IN DRIVE. IT SEEMED TO BE RUNNING FINE SO WE WERE BACK ON THE ROAD. MY GIRLFRIEND AND I WERE PRETTY SHAKEN UP UNTIL WE GOT TO OUR DESTINATION IN SAN DIEGO.

I ACTUALLY THOUGHT I BLEW A TIRE.THIS WAS AT NIGHT SO IN THE MORNING I CHECKED IT OUT WITH A FRIEND'S HELP AND SAW THE PLUG SITTING RIGHT WHERE IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE. SO WE WENT AND BOUGHT A NEW PLUG AND COIL PACK AND THREADED IT BACK IN AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT IT STAYED THERE AND STILL IS THERE TODAY. THIS FIRST TIME WAS ROUGHLY 3 1/2 YRS AGO. THE NEXT TIME IT HAPPENED WHILE MY SAME FRIEND WAS DRIVING MY TRUCK TO HIS HOUSE BUT THIS TIME IT WAS A DIFFERENT PLUG AND WE WEREN'T SO LUCKY THREADING IT BACK IN. THE THREADS WERE STRIPPED OUT SO WE HELICOILED IT BACK IN OURSELVES AND IT IS STILL THERE TODAY. THIS SECOND TIME WAS ROUGHLY 2 YRS AGO. THE LAST TIME HAPPENED IN A PARKING LOT RIGHT AS I STARTED MY TRUCK UP.THE PLUG ACTUALLY HIT THE UNDERSIDE OF THE HOOD WHEN IT BLEW. SO AGAIN I BOUGHT A NEW PLUG AND COIL PACK AND LUCKILY IT THREADED BACK IN AGAIN. SO NOW I AM VERY GUNSHY NATURALLY EVERYTIME I DRIVE IT. TO PROPERLY CORRECT THIS PROBLEM IT WOULD COST A SMALL FORTUNE AND TO SELL IT AS IS WHO WILL BUY IT. ALSO ON THIS SAME VEHICLE MY TRANSMISSION BLEW AT 39,000 MILES WHEN THE WARRANTY RAN OUT AT 36,000 NATURALLY I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. THAT COST ME $3,500 AND A WEEK STRANDED. I HAD TO HAVE A NEW TRANSMISSION INSTALLED AT A DEALERSHIP. THE TRUCK IS A F150 HARLEY DAVIDSON EDITION. IT NOW HAS ROUGHLY 94,000 MILES ON IT.

THIS IS THE CHEAPER EASIER WAY TO FIX IT FOR I DO NOT WANT TO REPLACE THE HEAD MYSELF NOR DO I WANT FORD'S INVESTING THOUSANDS TO REPLACE IT. *TR",

A RECALL NEEDS TO BE CALLED ON THESE ENGINES BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED OR HURT IN AN ACCIDENT DUE TO THE VEHICLE BREAKING DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF A HIGHWAY. IT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED, NOT AFTER. *TR",

I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO FORD DEALER # 1 WHO, WHEN I DESCRIBED THE SYMPTOMS, STATED IMMEDIATELY THAT THE PROBLEM WAS DUE TO WATER LEAKING PAST THE LOWER WINDSHIELD SEAL AND SHORTING OUT THE GEM MODULE AND THE FUSE BLOCK MOUNTED ON THE INTERIOR FIREWALL.  DEALER STATED \"THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR, YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO THE WORK YOURSELF\".  AS I DIDN'T FEEL I HAD THE ABILITY TO REPAIR, I LET IT GO FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.  IN LATE NOVEMBER OF 2006, I WAS DRIVING TO WORK BEFORE SUNRISE, IN A VERY HEAVY RAIN, WHEN THE WIPERS SHUT OFF AND THE DOME LIGHT CAME ON MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE.  I TOLD MY PARENTS ABOUT THIS & THEY INSTRUCTED ME TO TAKE VEHICLE TO FORD DEALER # 2 FOR REPAIR AT THEIR EXPENSE.  DEALER # 2 WAS AWARE OF THE CONDITION AS WELL.  THE ESTIMATE FOR REPAIR WAS $553 TO REPAIR THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS DAMAGED BY THE MOISTURE, AND THE VEHICLE WOULD THEN HAVE TO BE TAKEN TO A GLASS SHOP TO HAVE THE WINDSHIELD RE-SEALED.  THE WORK WAS DECLINED, AND I CONTACTED FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPLAINING THAT AS THIS WAS A SAFETY RELATED ISSUE, KNOWN TO BOTH DEALERSHIPS, I FELT THEY SHOULD ABSORB SOME OF THE EXPENSE OF MAKING VEHICLE DRIVABLE DURING ANY WEATHER CONDITION.  REQUEST WAS DENIED.  MY CONTENTION IS THAT SINCE DRIVING IN A RAINSTORM WITHOUT WIPERS AND AN ERRATIC ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, AND SINCE BOTH DEALERSHIPS WERE ACQUAINTED WITH THE CONDITION, THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A VOLUNTARY RECALL, OR AT THE VERY LEAST, A TSB ADVISING OWNERS OF THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM. *JB",

BUT, WHEN THIS HAPPENED IT GOUGED THE INSIDE OF THE WHEEL (A FACTORY WHEEL) AND CAUSED IT TO INSTANTLY DEFLATE THE TIRE AS I CAME TO A STOP.  I ENDED UP HAVING TO REPLACE THE WHEEL, THE ROTOR AND THE BRAKE PADS TO FIX THE DAMAGE.    ON OCTOBER 18, 2006, WHILE TRAVELING NOTHBOUND ON I-25, JUST NORTH OF EXIT 158, I HEARD A \"POPPING\" SOUND AND FELT AS IF I HAD RUN OVER A ROCK.  I THEN TOOK EXIT 161, AND WHILE TRAVELING ABOUT 25-30 MPH, AND STOPPING, MY FRONT, DRIVER'S-SIDE, TIRE SUDDENLY EXPLODED FROM A HUGE GASH IN THE SIDEWALL.   I WAS TOWING A 8'X10' FLATBED TRAILER WITH SOME TOOLS LOADED ON IT.    WHEN I WAS ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE TRAFFIC LANES, I REMOVED THE TIRE AND THE ENTIRE WHEEL HAD SPLIT IN TWO.  I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT AGAIN, THE LOWER CALIPER MOUNTING BRACKET BOLT HAD BACKED ITSELF OUT.  I HAD TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED AND THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER TOLD ME THAT HE KNEW OF THIS HAPPENING TO OTHER PEOPLE AFTER THEY HAD THEIR FORD PICKUP BRAKES WORKED ON.  HE SAID THAT IT IS NOT A PROBLEM, THAT HE KNEW OF, WHEN THE VEHICLES COME FROM THE FACTORY, ONLY AFTER THE BRAKES HAVE BEEN WORKED ON.  I HAD TO REPLACE THE WHEEL, THE TIRE, THE STEERING KNUCKLE, THE ROTOR AND THE PADS.  WE ENDED UP REPLACING THE LOWER BOLTS AND PUTTING LOCKTIGHT ON THE BOLTS (THIS WAS THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER AND MY MECHANIC).  WE DID SAVE THE DAMAGED PARTS.   AFTER THE FIRST INCIDENT MY MECHANIC CHECKED THE TECH SERVICE BULLETINS AND DID NOT FIND ANY BULLETINS FROM FORD RE: THIS ISSUE.

THIS WOULD MAKE MY TOTAL COST OVER 13,900.00 FOR OWNING A DEFECTIVE FORD PICK UP FOR 12 MONTHS. IN ESSENCE THERE IS NO WARRANTY. IT SHOULD BE FORD'S RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX THE DEFECT IN THE VEHICLE.

FOUR DAYS LATER THE TIRE WAS STILL NOT IN BUT THEY TOOK ONE OFF ANOTHER VEHICLE AND PUT IT ON MINE. TWO WEEKS LATER THE SAME WHEEL, WITH THE NEW TIRE, WENT FLAT AGAIN. THIS TIME THE DEALER TOLD ME TO TAKE IT TO THE TIRE SHOP AND HAVE IT CHECKED OUT. I DID SO AND WAS TOLD THE WHEEL HAD A LEAKING VALVE STEM, WAS FIXED FREE OF CHARGE AND SO FAR IS STILL UP. ON 10-23 THE RIGHT REAR TIRE ON MY TRUCK WENT FLAT. IT AS ALL THE REST ARE ALSO GENERAL GRABBERS.
