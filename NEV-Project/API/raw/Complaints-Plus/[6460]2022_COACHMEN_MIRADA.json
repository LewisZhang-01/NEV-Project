        "summary": "Driver side rear sway mount bracket fell off.  This is well documented on the internet and has been occurring for many years on the Ford F53 chassis.  Sway bar keeps sway and body roll to a minimum while driving.  Without the mount, it's ability to prevent sway is diminished.  If the bracket fell off during travel, the large solid piece of metal and bolts would have fallen into road and potentially cause an accident or damage to another vehicle.",
