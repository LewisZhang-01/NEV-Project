THE DEALER, RCD SALES AGREED WITH ME THAT THE BRAKES DID NOT WORK AND THEY HAD A SECOND 2016 TRAILER ON THEIR LOT WHICH THE BRAKES DID NOT FUNCTION EITHER AND THEY WERE SCARED TO SALE IT. I REVIEWED THE BRAKES MYSELF THEY WEEKEND AND DISCOVERED THAT THE WIRING USED BY THE MANUFACTURE WAS TOO SMALL. THERE WAS NEARLY A 3 VOLT (25%) VOLTAGE DROP FROM THE WIRING HARNESS TO THE BRAKE DRUMS. AFTER REPLACING WHAT APPEARED TO BE 16 GAUGE WIRE WITH 12 GAUGE WIRE THE BRAKES NOW WORK PROPERLY.
