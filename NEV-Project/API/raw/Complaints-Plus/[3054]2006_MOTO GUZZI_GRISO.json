        "summary": "THE MOTO-GUZZI GRISO 1100 & 1200'S ARE KNOWN WORLD WIDE FOR DASH FAILURES & STEPPER MOTOR FAILURES.  MY DASH FAILED AT 70 MPH SHUTTING DOWN ON THE HIGHWAY, THIS FAILURE SHUT ENGINE DOWN & GAVE NO READINGS.  I AM THANKFUL THAT I HAVE 49 YEARS OF RIDING EXPERIENCE. THESE DASHES ARE KNOWN TO FAIL FROM NEW WITH UP TO 20,000+ MILES ON BIKES. MINE FAILED AT 12000 & CHANGE.  BUT ISSUES STARTED SOONER.  DEALER WAS AS HELPFUL BUT PIAGGIO/MOTO-GUZZI NA WERE TOO IGNORANT TO HELP.  THE STEPPER MOTOR ON MY BIKE STARTED REVVING UP TO 3000RPM WITHIN 6000 MILES.  DEALERS HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS THEIR FIX WAS TO READJUST THE IDLE WHICH DOES NOT HELP.  STEPPER MOTORS FAIL BY ALLOWING THE ENGINE TO REV AS IF YOU ARE STILL ON THE THROTTLE WHEN THE RIDER IS OFF THE THROTTLE.  IF A RIDER IS NOT AWARE OF A PROBLEM IT MAY & PROBABLY CAUSED ACCIDENTS.  AGAIN THIS IS A WORLD WIDE FAILURE PROBLEM.    THE PROBLEM IS NO ONE HAS THE FORTITUDE TO FILE AGAINST MOTO-GUZZI/PIAGGIO.  IT IS KNOWN THE ITALIANS ARE DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH WHEN PROBLEMS EXIST.   ONE DAY OR IT POSSIBLY ALREADY HAPPENED SOMEONE MAY HAVE BEEN KILLED OR IN A SEVERE ACCIDENT DUE TO THESE FAILURES. *TR",
