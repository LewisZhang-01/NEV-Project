        "summary": "Grievance/Complaint for 2020 X5 BMW Firer December 9, 2021 (49 days Owner) I was on my way to work, and I stopped at the local Bank of America drive through. While on my way, I received two (2) malfunction message saying the same thing, \u201c Scam Likely 1-470-781-9727; (Check Control)   Vehicle key missing, Close message; Vehicle key not available or malfunctioning. Drive-ready mode cannot be started. See Driver\u2019s Manual for further information.\u201d  (This was the message/malfunction.) I took a picture and call my salesperson, Mr. Preston at BMW of Gwinnett Place and informed him that the key was in the cup, so I tried to place it on the dashboard.  I did not understand why I received a malfunction message the key missing because the car would not go anywhere without a key, however, he asked me to send the picture to him and I did. As I was getting out my X5, I began to have anxiety and became traumatized (praying, crying, yelling etc.) at this point, thinking my X5 is going to catch a fire and blow up the bank. I went into the Bank to alert them of the X5 smoking so that they can evacuate if needed. I went back to my X5 to gather as much as I could of my Christmas gifts and other Items quickly.  At that time another lady was standing on the side walk and asked if she could help me removed the items from my X5.I was hysterical, and my hand was bleeding from grabbing items out the X5. My safety and others was at risk. The X5 could have been in my garage on firer and my house and family could have died and lost everything; The seat belt could have locked with me in it and I could have died. The bank ATM drive through could have blown up and all the customers could have been injured.BMW of North America insisted that I fill on my insurance because the the engineers did an observation investigation and did not see any fault of manufacture or electrical issue.The vehicle is now under the investigation of my insurance and I have not been notified of the cause at this time.",

I was told that there was no fix for the problems I took it in for , and that Germany was notified and they had no solution, when a fix was found I would be notified.
