FIANCE' AND HER DAUGHTER WERE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE WHEN THE ENGINE JUST \"DIED\", NO POWER, NO WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATIONS, ETC.  VEHICLE DID/DOES RESTART AT THIS TIME.  THIS IS IDENTICAL TO THE HONDA CAMPAIGN RECALL #02V120000 WHICH COVERS SOME HONDAS OF THIS YEAR/MODEL.  I CONTACTED HONDA AND WAS BASICALLY BLOWN OFF...  \"SORRY, THIS RECALL DOESN'T COVER YOUR PARTICULAR VEHICLE'S VIN.\"  FAILURE OCCURS FREQUENTLY, AT RANDOM, NO PARTICULAR INDICATORS THAT IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.  CONSEQUENCES COULD BE FATAL IF THIS FAULT OCCURRED IN AN INTERSECTION, WHILE PASSING ANOTHER VEHICLE, ETC.    BECAUSE HONDA WOULD NOT MAKE SAFE THEIR FAULTY IGNITION SWITCH, I REPLACED THE SWITCH AT MY EXPENSE AT APPROXIMATELY $60/PART, PLUS MY TIME.  HONDA CHARGES $211 TO REPAIR THIS, SO THE \"TOTAL\" REPAIR COST WITH MY PARTS/LABOR IS $211.  I DID NOT SAVE THE PART UNFORTUNATELY, NOT THINKING OF NOTIFYING YOU UNTIL TOO LATE.  THE FINAL \"DYING\" THAT OCCURRED ON 9/18/2010 WAS THE LAST STRAW.  IT WOULD BE GREAT IF OTHERS SUFFERING FROM THIS OBVIOUS FAULT COULD BE REIMBURSED OR PREVENTED FROM HAVING TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE. *TR",

OH, AND I CAN'T FORGET THE STRONG SCENT OF FUEL IN THE AIR WHEN THIS HAPPENS.    IT STARTED AS A SPORADIC THING THAT HAPPENED WHENEVER I DROVE LONG DISTANCE (AN HOUR OR MORE) OR WHENEVER I WAS AT 1/4 OF A TANK. MORE RECENTLY, I CAN HARDLY DRIVE AT ALL.

IN ADDITION TO THE IGNITION COIL PROBLEM DESCRIBED BELOW I HAVE ALSO HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE SRS SYSTEM,  ABS SYSTEM, WIRELESS ENTRY SYSTEM, AIR CONDITIONER, AND THE AUTO DOOR LOCKS (ALL OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED IN ANOTHER COMPLAINT).      FOR A LONG TIME THE TACHOMETER BEHAVED RANDOMLY.  IT WOULD SURGE THEN FALL TO ZERO.  FOR PERIODS OF TIME IT BEHAVED NORMALLY.  THERE WAS NO PATTERN TO THE BEHAVIOR.  INITIALLY THE ENGINE PERFORMANCE WAS NOMINAL.  OVER TIME THE ENGINE BEGAN SURGING AND STALLING, NOT NECESSARILY IN RHYTHM WITH THE TACHOMETER, NOR EXHIBITING SUCH BEHAVIOR WHEN THE TACH WAS ACTING UP.  AGAIN THERE WAS NO OBVIOUS PATTERN.  FINALLY THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON REFERENCING A TRANSMISSION CODE THAT REFERRED TO THE IGNITION COIL.  INTERESTINGLY ONCE THE CODE WAS CLEARED THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WHEN OUT AND DID NOT ILLUMINATE FOR SOME TIME.  THE NEXT TIME IT ILLUMINATED IT EVENTUALLY TURNED ITSELF OUT.  I FINALLY TOOK THE CAR TO THE DETAILER.  THE DEALER SAID THAT THE IGNITION COIL WAS NOT TALKING TO THE TACH AND THE COMPUTER COULD NOT READ THE ENGINE IDLE SPEED.  CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS RECOMMENDED TO REPLACE THE IGNITION COIL AS IT EVIDENTLY HAD AN ELECTRICAL FAILURE.  I AM STILL RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM, BUT IT APPEARS THAT OTHER OWNERS HAVE HAD EXPERIENCES WITH THEIR 1997 HONDA ACCORDS' ENGINES SURGING AND STALLING AND IN SOME CASES CAUSING ACCIDENTS.

MY RESEARCH SHOWED THAT HONDA HAD BEEN HAVING PROBLEM WITH THESE COMPUTERS ALREADY FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT.  THE PROBLEM WAS WITH A SENSOR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG WHICH WAS MALFUNCTIONING IN SUCH A WAY AS TO LEAVE IN DOUBT WHETHER OR NOT THE AIR BAG WOULD DEPLOY.  IT IS RIDICULOUS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE TO PAY NEARLY 1,000.00 TO FIX SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS IN A SAFETY SYSTEM THAT HAVE REPEATEDLY NOT BEEN ADDRESSED.    2) MY ABS LIGHT STARTED COMING ON.  WHEN STARTING THE ENGINE THE PUMP MOTOR FOR THE ABS SYSTEM WOULD ACTIVATE AND ATTEMPT TO PUMP FLUID IN THE SYSTEM.  IT COULD BE HEARD FROM INSIDE THE CAR AS A GRINDING NOISE.  IT WOULD CYCLE ON AND OFF FOR ABOUT 6 OR SO TIMES THEN THE RELAY WOULD TRIP, TURN OFF MOTOR AND ILLUMINATE THE ABS LIGHT.  THE DEALER CLAIMED THAT THE AMS MODULE WAS MALFUNCTIONING AND NEEDED REPLACEMENT AT A COST OF 1,700.00.  RIDICULOUS.  AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ONLINE IT SEEMS THAT THIS IS ALSO A COMMON FAILURE FOR THIS MAKE AND MODEL OF CAR.    3) WIRELESS ENTRY SYSTEM FAILED.    4) A/C EVAPORATOR SPRUNG A LEAK    5) DRIVER SIDE PASSENGER DOOR AUTO LOCK DOES NOT WORK.

THIS PART WAS OR COULD HAVE BEEN ON THE SHELF FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS BEFORE IT WAS INSTALLED IN MY VEHICLE.  MY SRS PART NUMBER TAKEN FROM MY VEHICLE HAS PART # MODEL 77960-SV4-A93.

TO KEEP THIS COMPLAINT FORM BRIEF, ONLY THE MAIN TOPICS WILL BE DISCUSSED.  THE DEFECT CONSISTS OF THE SEATBELT FAILING TO FULLY LATCH IN PLACE IF A SMALL AMOUNT OF A BEVERAGE (USUALLY SODA POP) IS SPILLED INTO THE SEATBELT HOUSING.  AFTER DRYING, THE BEVERAGE RESIDUE BECOMES STICKY AND THE DESIGN OF THE SEATBELT BUCKLE PREVENTS THE BUCKLE FROM LATCHING SECURELY.  THE FAILURE MODE CAN BE EITHER THE SEATBELT NOT LATCHING AT ALL OR THE BUCKLE GIVING A 'FALSE LATCH' CONDITION MEANING THAT THE SEATBELT TONGUE CLICKS AND SEEMS TO HOLD IN PLACE NORMALLY TO THE OCCUPANT BUT IF PULLED FIRMLY IT WILL RELEASE.  OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN TO OCCUPANTS.  HONDA HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS DEFECT AND EVEN HAS RETURNED WARRANTY PARTS (ESTIMATE OVER 1000 FAILURES HAVE BEEN RETURNED BY CUSTOMERS) THAT IT HAS CATEGORIZED AS BSR (BROWN STICKY RESIDUE).  THIS PROBLEM GOES BACK AT LEAST AS FAR AS 1994 (WITH THE 1994 STYLE DESIGN BEING ESPECIALLY PRONE TO THIS FAILURE).   AS STATED, HONDA HAS RECEIVED MANY FAILURES OF THIS TYPE BACK BUT HAS TAKEN NO ACTION TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  IT IS UNKNOWN HOW MANY PEOPLE MAY HAVE BEEN WEARING THEIR SEAT BELT BUT WHEN IN A COLLISION IT UNLATCHED AND ALLOWED THEM TO BE INJURED.  FURTHERMORE, WITH HONDA PLACING A CUPHOLDER JUST INCHES AWAY FROM THE SEATBELT BUCKLE (AND WITH THE BUCKLE DESIGNED IN A FUNNEL SHAPE), IT IS OBVIOUS THAT HONDA KNEW BEVERAGES WOULD BE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE BUCKLE.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM AND I HOPE THAT AN INVESTIGATION WILL BE CONDUCTED TO HELP SAVE LIVES.  FORCING HONDA TO PRESENT THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE WARRANTY CLAIMS IT HAS RECEIVED FOR SEAT BELT BUCKLES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WOULD SHOW THAT HONDA HAS KNOWN OF THE DEFECT BUT HAS TAKEN NO STEPS TO CORRECT IT OR INFORM ITS CUSTOMERS OF THE DANGER.  *AK",

BUT THE BOTTOMLINE IS THAT I HAVE MAINTAINED THIS VEHICLE WELL AND GENERALLY THE USAGE HABITS AFFECT MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS NOT THE AUTOMATIC ONES.

MY FOOT WAS NOT ON THE ACCELERATOR AND THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS \"OFF\".  HOWEVER, THE ACCORD WAS ACCELERATING BY ITSELF.  IT FELT THE CAR WAS ON CRUISE CONTROL.  WHILE GOING UPHILL, IT BEGAN TO SPEED UP INSTEAD OF SLOWING DOWN.  THE ONLY WAY I CAN SLOW MY VEHICLE WAS TO DOWNSHIFT AT 2ND OR 3RD GEAR.  MY ACCORD IS AN AUTOMATIC.  I HAD TO PERIODICALLY PRESS THE BRAKES BECAUSE THE CAR WAS APPROACHINGS SPEEDS UP TO 80 MPH.  AFTER 5 MILES OF SHEER TERROR, I DECIDED TO EXIT ON AN OFFRAMP AND WHILE THE ACCORD WAS STOPPED, THE ACCORD BEGAN IDLING  VERY HIGH.  APPLYING THE BRAKES TOOK EFFORT.  BECAUSE, ONCE I LET GO, THE CAR BEGAN TO ACCELERATE BY ITSELF.  FINALLY, I REACHED THE HONDA DEALERSHIP-AVERY GREEN MOTORS. UNTIL NOW, THE CAR IS STILL THERE, BECAUSE THE THROTTLE CABLE IS IN BACK ORDER.  THE NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID 99I002000 FOR FUEL THROTTLE LINKAGES AND CONTROL IS WHAT I SUSPECT IS THE DEFECT THAT IS OCCURING WITH THE ACCORD.  ORIGINALLY, THE DEALER QUOTED AN ESTIMATE OF $90.00.  THEN, I RECEIVED A CALL THAT I HAVE A BAD THROTTLE CABLE AND IT SHOULD BE REPLACED.  THE ESITMATE WAS APPROXIMATELY $500.00.  THE MANUFACTUER/DEALER SHOULD/MUST FIX THIS PROBLEM WITHOUT ANY COST TO ME.  ACCORDING TO OFFICE OF DEFECTS INVESTIGATION-RECALL DATABASE 888-327-4236  DEALERS WILL REPLACE THE THROTTLE CABLE.  HONDA HAS DECIDED TO CONDUCT A PRODUCT IMPROVEMENT CAMPAIGN TO REPLACE THE THROTTLE CABLE.  OWNERS CAN CONTACT HONDA AT 800-999-1009.  MY MAIN QUESTION IS THIS.  WHY WAS I NOT NOTIFIED OF THIS DEFECT?  I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY WRITTEN NOTIFICATION OR CALLS FOR THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM OCCURING TO MY ACCORD.  HOWEVER, I EXPERIENCED THIS FIRSTHAND ON 3/26/01.  A POTENTIAL ACCIDENT WAS IN A MAKING, ESPECIALLY DURING RUSH HOUR IN THE MORNING - 5:30AM PST.  IF ADVANCE WARNING WAS GIVEN TO ME, THE INCONVENIECE AND DANGER WOULD HAVE BEEN AVERTED.*AK",
