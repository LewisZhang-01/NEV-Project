        "summary": "WE OWN A 2004 JEEP LIBERTY THAT WAS PURCHASED NEW IN VIRGINIA AND RESOLD TO OUR FAMILY IN 2013, IN VIRGINIA.  ON 22 JUNE 2017, MY 18 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING OUR JEEP ON MOUNTAIN ROADS ABOUT 50 MILES FROM OUR HOME WHEN SHE NOTICED THE VEHICLE WAS \"SWERVING\" AND MAKING A NOISE.  SHE MANAGED TO SAFELY MOVE THE VEHICLE OUT OF THE TRAFFIC LANE AND CONTACT ME.     UPON MY ARRIVAL AND INSPECTION OF THE VEHICLE, I NOTICED THE REAR LOWER CONTROL ARM ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE HAD COMPLETELY BROKEN AND ALLOWED THE REAR END TO SHIFT POSITION, CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO TRACK FAR OUT OF ALIGNMENT AND CAUSING THE REAR TIRE TO RUB ON THE FENDER WALL.  I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE RUST APPEARED TO BE THE CAUSE OF THE CONTROL ARMS FAILURE.    AFTER GETTING THE VEHICLE HOME AND RESEARCHING PARTS TO REPLACE THE BROKEN CONTROL ARM, I DISCOVERED THAT PART HAD BEEN RECALLED ON 2004 JEEP LIBERTYS WHICH SURPRISED ME BECAUSE I HAD THE VEHICLE SERVICED BY A JEEP DEALER TO ENSURE ALL RECALLS HAD BEEN COMPLETED.  UPON FURTHER RESEARCH, HOWEVER, I LEARNED THE RECALL ONLY EFFECTED THOSE LIBERTYS IN THE NORTH EAST AND UPPER MIDWEST WHERE SALT IS FREQUENTLY USED ON SNOWY ROADS (HTTPS://WWW.AUTOTRADER.COM/CAR-RECALL/JEEP-ADDS-137000-LIBERTY-SUVS-TO-RECALL-171108).      WHILE THIS EXPLAINS WHY THE DEALERSHIP HADN'T REPAIRED THE ITEM, IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T EXPLAIN WHY WE WEREN'T NOTIFIED THAT THE PART IS PRONE TO SUCH FAILURES, CONSIDERING VIRGINIA DOES RECEIVE A FAIR SHARE OF SNOW AND A HUGE PORTION OF THE VIRGINIA POPULATION COMMUTES INTO WASHINGTON D.C. (WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN THE RECALL) IT SEEMS EXTREMELY NEGLIGENT TO ALLOW OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE THEM WITHOUT AT LEAST A NOTIFICATION EVEN IF JEEP DOESN'T HAVE TO REPLACE THE ITEM.    I PURCHASED UNGRADED AFTERMARKET CONTROL ARMS AND INSTALLED THEM MYSELF, I'VE INCLUDED A PICTURE OF THE ORIGINAL CONTROL ARM.

THE NHTSA DID A THREE YEAR INVESTIGATION THAT SHOWED 51 PEOPLE DIED IN FIERY CRASHES IN JEEPS WITH GAS TANKS POSITIONED BEHIND THE REAR AXLE. TO ALLEVIATE THIS PROBLEM CHRYSLER IS TO INSTALL A TOW HITCH FREE OF CHARGE.   I HAVE MADE NUMEROUS PHONE CALLS TO MY LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP AND THEN ALSO CONTACTED CHRYSLER AT THEIR 1-800 NUMBER. DESPITE THESE PHONE CALLS NO ONE COULD PROVIDE AN ANSWER AS TO WHEN THIS POTENTIAL LIFE THREATENING PROBLEM WOULD BE FIXED. ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO I RECEIVED A LETTER IN THE MAIL FROM CHRYSLER GROUP LLC INFORMING ME OF THE RECALL (AS IF I WAS UNAWARE) AND THAT THE PARTS REQUIRED ARE CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE. SO THIS RECALL HAS BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE JUNE AND THERE IS NO CLEAR DATE THAT MY VEHICLE WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH A TOW HITCH TO PREVENT A FIERY CRASH. IT IS APPARENT THROUGH NEWSPAPER ARTICLES THAT CHRYSLER HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO ISSUE THE RECALL AND IT IS SPECULATED THAT THEY DID SO AS TO NOT HURT THEIR IMAGE AND FINANCES. ALSO TO AVOID A PUBLIC RELATIONS NIGHTMARE AND BEING FORCED TO PROVIDE THE RECALL AFTER POTENTIAL PUBLIC HEARINGS WITH WITNESSES PROVIDING DETAILS OF DEADLY CRASHES INVOLVING  JEEPS.   IT IS APPEARS THAT CHRYSLER IS TRYING TO AVOID THIS REPAIR DUE TO COST. IT HAS BEEN SEVEN MONTHS SINCE THE RECALL AND NOT A SINGLE VEHICLE HAS BEEN REPAIRED. IT IS ALSO UNKNOWN WHEN THE REPAIRS WILL BE MADE AS THE PARTS ARE UNAVAILABLE. I QUESTION THE INTEGRITY OF CHRYSLER IN REGARDS TO THIS RECALL AND ASK THAT YOU PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS SITUATION. THIS RECALL COULD POTENTIAL SAVE LIVES AND IT APPEARS THAT THIS IS NOT BEING DONE IN ORDER TO SAVE MONEY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION.   UPDATED 01/30/14",

THE REAR END OF THE JEEP SWAYED SIDE TO SIDE UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO BRING IT TO A STOP.  THE DRIVERS SIDE REAR LOWER CONTROL ARM SNAPPED CAUSING THE REAR AXLE TO MOVE TO THE REAR ON THE DRIVERS SIDE.  THIS CAUSED THE DRIVE SHAFT TO PULL OUT OF THE TRANSMISSION AND HIT THE GROUND.  WHILE MOVING FORWARD THE DRIVE SHAFT WAS DRAGGING ON THE PAVEMENT MOVING SIDE TO SIDE AS IT WAS STILL TURNING BECAUSE THE REAR WHEELS WERE TURNING.

THIS CAR IS DRIVEN MOST BY MY WIFE WITH ONLY MY DAUGHTER IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT. ON THIS EVENING WE  HAD TWO ADULTS IN THE FRONT AND TWO  ADULTS IN THE REAR SEAT.  I BELIEVE IT WAS THE ADDED WEIGHT IN THE REAR SEAT THAT CAUSED THE ARM TO BREAK AT THIS TIME.

(2) THE WINDOW COULD NOT BE OPERATED BY THE POWER SWITCH AND THEREFORE, I HAD TO REMOVE THE DOOR PANEL AND SECURE THE GLASS WITH A PIECE OF WOOD.    (3)  THE FAILURE HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED AT THIS TIME.  WHILE RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM - I HAVE FOUND THAT THIS IS A REOCCURRING PROBLEM ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH JEEP LIBERTY'S AND I FEEL THAT THIS IS A GREAT SAFETY PROBLEM.  THE GLASS IN THE WINDOW IS FOR PROTECTION AND SHOULD IT FALL OUT WHILE DRIVING AT A NORMAL RATE OF SPEED - THIS COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE DRIVER, PASSENGERS OR OTHER CARS ON THE HIGHWAY.  I FEEL LIKE CHRYSLER CORPERATION SHOULD BEAR THE COSTS TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM AND NOT LEAVE IT UP TO THE OWNERS TO CORRECT THIS DEFECT IN THE LIBERTY.  THERE ARE PAGES AND PAGES ONLINE WITH LIBERTY OWNERS WHO HAVE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM.  JUST ENTERING (JEEP LIBERTY WINDOW PROBLEMS) WILL TAKE YOU TO NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE.

MY PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW MADE A LOUD POP AND THEN MY WINDOW FELL DOWN. IT WOULD NOT GO BACK UP. I FINALLY PULLED OVER AND TUGGED IT UP IN TO POSITION AND GOT IT TO CLOSE. IT NOW WILL NOT RAISE OR CLOSE PROPERLY. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND THEY TELL ME IT IS THE WINDOW REGULATOR HAS FAILED. THIS SUDDEN COLLAPSE OF THE WINDOW CAUSED ME TO LOOK IMMEDIATELY RIGHT TO SEE WHAT I THOUGHT WAS SOMETHING HITTING MY VEHICLE. THEN THE SURPRISE OF MY WINDOW DROPPING WHILE DRIVING IN TRAFFIC. THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED ME TO MAKE A SUDDEN DRIVING ERROR CAUSING AN ACCIDENT AS IT SCARED ME WHEN IT HAPPENED. IT WAS A VERY LOUD POP SOUND !  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND I WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE ABOUT $500.00 TO FIX. AFTER RESEARCHING THIS ON THE WEB, I SEE I AM ONE OF THOUSANDS WITH DEFECTIVE WINDOWS THAT DROP FOR NO REASON IN THESE DOORS OF THE JEEP LIBERTY. SOME 6-7 TIMES. WE AS CONSUMERS DESERVE BETTER FROM CHRYSLER. IF YOU CHECK THE SERVICE RECORDS FOR THIS PROBLEM IT SHOULD STAND OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB. WE DESPERATELY NEED A RECALL OF FOR THIS PART OF THE VEHICLE THAT THE DEALERSHIPS ARE WILLING TO REPLACE WHILE UNDER WARRANTY AND ACKNOWLEDGE THERE IS A PROBLEM AND REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE ONES BUT ONCE THE WARRANTY EXPIRES THEN WE ARE ON OUR OWN. THE PROBLEM IS IN THE DESIGN ITSELF. THE WINDOW REGULATOR IS CAUSING PROBLEMS THAT ARE A SAFETY CONCERN AND HAZARD. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE WITH THE JEEP LIBERTY. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NO HELP. THEY TELL ME TO PAY THE REPAIR EXPENSE (CAUSED BY THE MANUFACTURER'S CHEAPLY MADE PRODUCT) THEN SEND IN MY RECEIPT AND IT MAY GET REVIEWED. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. THERE ARE TOO MANY THAT ARE HAVING TO BE REPLACED. THIS IS A PROBLEM. I URGE SOMEONE TO LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS. THIS IS NOT JEEP QUALITY THAT I THOUGHT I WAS PURCHASING WHEN I PAID THE HUGE AMOUNT FOR THIS VEHICLE BRAND NEW.  *TR",

I WAS A FEW FEET BEHIND MY JEEP AND I CALLED MY BOYFRIEND TO LET HIM KNOW WE WERE STRANDED.  WHILE ON THE PHONE I NOTICED FIRE AND SPARKS FALLING UNDERNEATH THE JEEP,I IMMEDIATELY CALLED 911.  WHILE ON THE PHONE WITH THE OPERATOR I HEARD A LOUD BANG LIKE A GUNSHOT AND LOOKED AND SAW SMOKE AND FLAMES FROM UNDER THE HOOD, THE 911 OPERATOR TOLD ME TO RUN FROM THE JEEP AND GET AS FAR AS I COULD, I LOOKED BACK AND THE FIRE WAS HUGE . THE FIRETRUCK AND POLICE CAME AND PUT OUT THE FIRE, EVERYTHING FROM THE FRONT SEAT TO THE FRONT BUMPER WAS MELTED.  THE WHOLE INSIDE WAS FILLED WITH SOOT AND WATER, THE WINDSHIELD WAS BROKEN.

MY INITIAL COMPLAINT STARTED ON OCTOBER 29, 2007.  I NOTICED WHILE I WAS DRIVING, FOR NO REASON AT ALL, THE BACK DRIVER SIDE WINDOW SLID DOWN.  THERE WAS NO RECOVERY, SO I VISITED THE CHRYSLER DEALER, DARNER CHRYSLER-JEEP IN MESA, ARIZONA.  I ALSO CONTACTED THE CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY AGREED TO COMPENSATE HALF OF THE TOTAL BILL OF $304.57.  THEY COMPENSATED $154.57.  ABOUT A MONTH LATER, NOVEMBER 23, 2007 I HAD THE EXACT EVENT HAPPEN ONLY IT WAS THE DRIVER WINDOW THAT HAD SLID DOWN.  I REPEATED MY VISIT TO THE DEALER AND CALLED CHRYSLER TO ASK FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE.  THEY AGREED THIS TIME TO PAY FOR THE LABOR OF $147.00.  I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR $162.89.  I NOW HAVE A THIRD WINDOW WITH THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM THAT I DISCOVERED YESTERDAY, JANUARY 31, 2008.  I CALLED CHRYSLER AND EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS WITH THESE NUMEROUS EVENTS AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD NOT ASSIST ME THIS TIME AS THIS IS THE THIRD EVENT.    ALTHOUGH THE CHRYSLER CORPORATION AND THE DEALER ARE BOTH AWARE OF THE NUMEROUS REPLACEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE FOR NOT ONLY ME BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO OWN THE 2004 JEEP LIBERTY, THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO ASSIST ME IN ANY COMPENSATION FOR THE THIRD INSTANCE OR SEEM TO HAVE CONCERN FOR THE SAFETY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS.  I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS PROBLEM AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE U.S. THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THEIR WINDOW DROPPING DOWN AS A RESULT OF A DEFECTIVE REGULATOR.  I FOUND NO CURRENT RECALL AT THE CURRENT TIME.  I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY AND SECURITY ISSUE THAT COULD CAUSE HARM TO THE PASSENGERS AND THE DRIVERS OF THIS VEHICLE.   I AM ASKING FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE IN FORCING A RECALL FOR THIS PART IN THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE.

UPON LEAVING THE SHOP THEY WENT  OVER THE  VEHICLE AND GAVE IT A REPORT CARD BASICALLY AND SAID EVERYTHING WAS IN TIP TOP SHAPE WHEN IT LEFT.  A LITTLE OVER A WEEK AFTER WE GOT IT OUT WE WERE DRIVING AND STOPPED AT A STOP LIGHT AND WHEN WE STARTED TO GO AGAIN WE NOTICED A LOUD GRINDING NOISE FROM THE RIGHT REAR OF THE VEHICLE.  WE DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT UNTIL WE GOT UP THE ROAD ABOUT 2 MILES AND STOPPED AT ANOTHER TRAFFIC LIGHT AND NOTICED THE RIGHT REAR TIRE APPEARED TO BE SMOKING.  WE HAPPENED TO BE RIGHT NEXT TO A GAS STATION SO WE PULLED OVER AND PUT WATER ON THE TIRE TO COOL IT OFF SINCE IT WAS SO DARN HOT.  WE WAITED ABOUT 20 MINUTES AND THEN DROVE THE CAR BACK HOME WHICH WAS ABOUT 5 MILES AWAY.  WHEN WE LEFT IT STILL WAS GRINDING.  WE WAITED A FEW DAYS AND THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE JUST RUSTED OVER, AND THEN DROVE IT AGAIN.  IT DIDN'T SEEM TO MAKE THE GRINDING SOUND EXCEPT EVERY SO OFTEN SO WE KIND OF WROTE IT OFF.  AFTER ABOUT A MONTH OF THIS OFF AND ON GRINDING WE DECIDED ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH AND WE WERE NOW GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.  AFTER TALKING TO ABOUT 4 RANDOM OTHER LIBERTY OWNERS IN DIFFERENT PARKING LOTS, 3 OUT OF THE 4  I TALKED TO HAD THE SAME PROBLEM I DO.  SO IT IS VERY APPARENT TO ME THAT JEEP HAS A DEFECTIVE BRAKE PART IF 4 OUT OF 5 LIBERTY'S INCLUDING MINE HAVE HAD THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM WITHIN AS LITTLE AS 6 MONTHS OF A BRAND NEW LIBERTY FOR ONE OWNER AND JUST ABOUT ALL WITHIN 40,000 MILES.  THIS DID NOT CAUSE AN ACCIDENT FOR US, BUT IF THAT ONE BRAKE HAD REALLY LOCKED UP ON THE HIGHWAY THAT COULD CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO GO INTO A SPIN AND MAYBE EVEN ROLL OVER.  WE ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING THIS FIXED AND WE NEED TO REPLACE THE PISTONS IN THE RIGHT REAR BRAKE WITH POSSIBLY EVEN HAVING TO REPLACE THE WHOLE BRAKE ASSEMBLY.  *AK",

TRYING TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALER TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM REVEALED THERE WOULD BE AN 8 WEEK WAIT BECAUSE THE PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE.  I LEARNED FROM THE DEALER (AND LATER VERIFIED BY CALLING DAIMLER CHRYSLER AT 1.800.853.1403) THAT DAIMLER CHRYSLER IS MAKING ONLY 3 REPLACEMENT PARTS AVAILABLE TO DEALERS PER WEEK!  IF THIS IS SUCH A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION, DOESN'T DAIMLER CHRYSLER HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE MORE PARTS AVAILABLE TO DEALERS OF THEIR DEFECTIVE CARS?  I UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF CARS, BUT THAT DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT I AM DRIVING A DEFECTIVE VEHICLE  WHICH I WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE FOR ANOTHER 8 WEEKS.  HOW CAN SUCH A HUGE CORPORATION NOT INSURE THAT PARTS ARE AVAILABLE TO THEIR DEALERS IN A MORE TIMELY FASHION?  WHAT HAPPENS IF INDEED A CRASH OCCURS WITHOUT PRIOR WARNING DURING THAT WAITING PERIOD?  WHAT WILL DAIMLER CHRYSLER SAY AND DO THEN?  THIS IS A SHAMEFUL EXAMPLE OF VIOLATING THE PUBLIC TRUST-AND THIS CAR IS NOT CHEAP-THEY ARE CERTAINLY NOT SAYING-HOLD YOUR PAYMENTS UNTIL THE CAR IS REPAIRED.  WHAT CAN I DO BUT WAIT?*JB",

I PARKED THE JEEP INTO MY PARKING SPACE WITH A TERRIBLE GRINDING NOISE AS TO NOT GET HIT SINCE I WAS BLOCKING THE DRIVE.  I CALLED FOR ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE TO HAVE IT TOWED AS IT WAS NOT DRIVABLE.  THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE WAS SITTING MUCH LOWER THAN THE DRIVER SIDE.  WHEN THE TOW TRUCK ARRIVED, THE DRIVER COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT HE SAW.  THE LOWER FRONT BALL JOINT HAD COMPLETELY SEPARATED FROM THE CONTROL ARM AND THE TIRE WAS ON THE LINE OF COMPLETELY FALLING OFF.  HE WAS NOT EQUIPPED TO REMOVE IT FROM THE PARKING SPACE WITHOUT CAUSING MORE DAMAGE TO IT AT THAT TIME, SO I HAD TO HAVE A DIFFERENT TOW TRUCK DISPATCHED THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO RAISE IT ON A DOLLY AND REMOVE IT FROM THE PARKING SPACE TO TOW IT.  THE NEXT DAY I SPOKE TO MY DEALERSHIP & THEY SAID THE 2002 & 2003 MODELS HAD BEEN RECALLED FOR THIS EXACT SAME PROBLEM.

A FEW DAYS LATER, A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, HIRED BY CHRYSLER, CALLED ME TO ASK FURTHER QUESTIONS AFTER HAVING EXAMINED THE CAR AT THE SALVAGE YARD.  A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT, I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM DAIMLER-CHRYSLER, ASSERTING THAT THE TYPE ACCIDENT I HAD, WOULD NOT SET OFF THE SENSORS THAT WOULD DEPLOY THE STEERING WHEEL AIRBAGS.

WHEN TURNING THE VEHICLE IT DIDN'T WANT TO STRAIGHTEN BACK OUT LIKE MOST CARS DO.  YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO TURN THE WHEEL TO GET IT GOING BACK IN A STRAIGHT DIRECTION AGAIN.  I DECIDED I NEEDED TO STOP AND HAVE A TRAINED SERVICE TECHNICIAN LOOK AT THE VEHICLE THAT MORNING.  WHEN I GOT THERE AND EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM TO THE MAINTENANCE MAN HE SAID LETS TAKE IT FOR A TEST DRIVE.  HE STATED THAT HE DIDN'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLE GOING DOWN THE ROAD BUT DID NOTICE IT WAS A LITTLE HARD TO TURN.  HE STATED THAT THEY COULDN'T LOOK AT IT THAT DAY, SO HE SCHEDULED FOR ME TO BRING IT BY ON WEDNESDAY APRIL 5TH WHICH WAS 5 DAYS AFTER I HAD TAKEN IT BY.  HE ASSURED ME EVERYTHING WAS OKAY AND THAT IT WAS ALRIGHT TO DRIVE.  ON APRIL 4, 2006 MY WIFE CALLED ME AT 9:05 A.M. TO LET ME KNOW THAT THE CAR HAD BROKEN DOWN.  I ASKED HER WHAT WAS WRONG, AND SHE STATED THAT SHE BARELY GOT IT INTO THE YMCA PARKING LOT WHERE SHE WAS DROPPING OFF MY 3 YEAR OLD FOR PRESCHOOL.  WHEN IT BROKE MY WIFE SAID THE VEHICLE DROPPED LIKE SHE HAD A BLOW OUT.

IT'S THE WAY JEEP DESIGNED IT, TO SUPPOSEDLY COMPENSATE FOR NOT HAVING ANTILOCK BRAKES. THIS MAKES THE VEHICLE VERY DIFFICULT TO STOP ON SNOW AND ICE. WHEN TRYING TO STOP AT 25 MPH I SLID MORE THAN 50FT RIGHT THROUGH AN INTERSECTION. IT WAS A GOOD THING THE OTHER VEHICLE DID STOP.  THIS VEHICLE IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN ALL WEATHER VEHICLE, BUT THE WAY THAT THIS ONE STOPS ON SNOW, IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE IN WINTER.    *NM",
