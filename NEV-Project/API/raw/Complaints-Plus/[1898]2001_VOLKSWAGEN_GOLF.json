NO BIG DEAL, IT'S JUST A TRUCK LOCK, NO NEED TO WORRY, SO I REFUSED THE $900 ESTIMATED REPAIR AMOUNT FOR A NEW COMFORT CONTROL MODULE (CCM) REPLACEMENT.

I GOT OUT AND CHECKED IF THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG OR WHAT OBSTRUCTING THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS. I FOUND NOTHING, IT JUST SIMPLY STOP WORKING ALONG WITH MY POWER WINDOWS.  I WENT TO THE DEALER AFTER THE RAIN AND AGAIN THEY WERE CAUSED BY THE MALFUNCTION CCM.  SINCE IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE A CAR WITHOUT A PAIR OF FUNCTIONAL WINDSHIELD WIPERS AND WINDOWS, I WAS RECOMMENDED TO HAVE THE CCM REPLACED.  I WENT ONLINE AND FOUND THAT MANY VW OWNERS HAVE SOME SIMILAR CCM COMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS AND I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THE CCM IS A BIG SAFETY CONCERN,  THIS IS WHY I AM FILING THIS COMPLAINT TO SEE IF IT CAN MINIMIZE THE DANGER AND SAFETY.

I PULLED OVER INTO A GAS STATION.  I PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND TRIED TO SHIFT BACK INTO DRIVE, BUT THE SHIFTER WOULDN'T BUDGE.  I FINALLY GOT IT TO GO INTO PARK AFTER A TOW TRUCK DRIVER SUGGESTED THAT I TURN THE IGNITION TO DIFFERENT POSITIONS WHILE PUMPING THE BREAK AND PULLING ON THE SHIFTER.  IT FINALLY RELEASED AND I DROVE IMMEDIATELY TO THE NEAREST VOLKSWAGEN DEALERSHIP.  THE MALFUNCTION WAS IN THE BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH SO I HAD  TO GET IT REPLACED.  I WAS CHARGED $40 FOR THE PART ITSELF AND $230 FOR THE WORK.  I FEEL THAT SINCE THERE IS A RECALL ON THE 1998-2002 VW BEETLE AND THE 1999-2001 VW JETTA THAT THERE SHOULD BE ONE ON THE 2001 VW GOLF AS WELL.  *NM",

THIS MORNING DURING MY MORNING COMMUTE MY ENGINE STALLED 4 TIMES, 3 OF WHICH WERE ON AN EXTREMELY BUSY FREEWAY DURING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC.    THIS IS A KNOWN AND WELL DOCUMENTED PROBLEM WITH THE TDI ENGINE.  THERE HAVE BEEN A LARGE NUMBER OF REPORTS OF THIS PROBLEM (SEE HTTP://FORUMS.TDICLUB.COM AND SEARCH FOR \"RELAY 109\" FOR EXAMPLES).

VW KNOWS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND IT IS A SEVERE SAFETY ISSUE... THE ENGINE WILL STOP RUNNING WITHOUT WARNING AND MAY NOT BE RESTARTED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.  LUCKILY THIS MORNING I WAS ONLY TRAVELING AT APPROXIMATELY 15 MPH WHEN THE FIRST STALL HAPPENED.  I RECOGNIZED THE PROBLEM AND AFTER I WAS ABLE TO RESTART MY ENGINE AND CONTINUE ON, I GOT INTO THE RIGHT-HAND LANE, ASSUMING THAT IT WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN.

IN NO WAY AN INCIDENT THAT SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED THE AIRBAG SYSTEM.
