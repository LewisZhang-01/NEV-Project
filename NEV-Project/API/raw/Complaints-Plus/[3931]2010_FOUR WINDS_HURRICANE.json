CONSUMER REQUESTS REIMBURSEMENT FOR BATTERY CONTROL CENTER REPAIRS AND WRITES IN REGARDS TO  REPLACEMENT OF LEAKING BLACK WATER TANK.  *SMD  THE CONSUMER RECEIVED A CALL FROM A REPRESENTATIVE STATING THE CLAIM WAS DENIED, BECAUSE THE INCIDENT WAS NOT RELATED TO THE RECALL. HIS REASONING FOR DENYING THE CLAIM, WAS  BECAUSE THE CONSUMER INDICATED THAT POWER TO THE STARTER WAS LOST BECAUSE OF THE BCC FAILURE AND SINCE THE STARTER POWER DID NOT GO THROUGH THE BCC, THE INCIDENT COULD NOT BE RELATED. ALSO, THE MECHANIC INFORMED THE CONSUMER THE WATER TANK HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY DAMAGED AND REPAIRED. HE STATED A HOLE IN THAT PARTICULAR TYPE OF TANK, COULD NOT BE PERMANENTLY REPAIRED, BECAUSE THE REPAIR WOULD BEGIN TO LEAK WITHIN A FEW YEARS. THE CONSUMER STATED HE PURCHASED THE MOTORHOME BRAND NEW AND HE NEVER HAD THE TANK REPAIRED, SINCE HE OWNED IT.",

UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, THE CUSTOMER FOUND THAT THE CONTROL BOARD ON THE IOTA ITS50-R HAD OBVIOUS SIGNS OF COMPONENT FAILURE. THE CUSTOMER CONTACTED THE MANUFACTURER (NOW THOR) AND WAS ADVISED THAT THEIR MODEL DID NOT FALL UNDER NHTSA CAMPAIGN# 12V516000 DUE TO THE PRODUCTION DATE. THE MANUFACTURER HAS OFFERED TO SUPPLY THE CUSTOMER WITH A REPLACEMENT UNIT AT NO COST; BUT IS NOT COVERING THE COST OF INSTALLATION. THE CUSTOMER REPORTED THAT THE OVER-VOLTAGE CONDITIONS MAY HAVE ALSO CAUSED PERIPHERAL DAMAGE TO OTHER APPLIANCES.
