I took the car in to get fixed with the recall notice.  Everything was fine until now the ABS light has been coming on frequently again & it is doing the same exact thing when braking.  It seems when the light is off & the brakes start to not work properly then the light comes on & they do work.  I never know when this is going to happen when the brakes fail. There is no loss of brake fluid. The recall repair was done at Ricart in Columbus Ohio. The problem was confirmed by the recall that this was faulty.",

THE SECOND TIME IT HAPPENED, THEY ONCE AGAIN CORRECTED THEMSELVES SO NO APPOINTMENT WAS MADE. THE THIRD TIME IT HAPPENED (JULY 2013), I ACTUALLY RAN INTO THE BACK OF ANOTHER VEHICLE.

MY BRAKE PEDAL WAS \"SOFT\", WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FLOOR, AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO STOP. HAD THERE BEEN ANOTHER VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME, I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AVOID HITTING IT. THE MECHANIC FOUND THAT MY BRAKES WERE FINE AND REPLACED THE MASTER CYLINDER WITH A NEW ONE. IN AUGUST OF 2011, I HAD THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. I HAD DRIVEN 30 MILES TO HOME FROM WORK AND THEN RAN A FEW ERRANDS AROUND TOWN. AS I WAS HEADING HOME, I APPLIED THE BRAKES AND FELT A JERK OR A POP AND THEN THE BRAKES WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND I ONLY HAD MINIMAL BRAKING POWER. I IMMEDIATELY DROVE ABOUT 3 MILES TO MY SHOP AND HAD PROBLEMS STOPPING THE ENTIRE TIME. I DID HAVE MORE BRAKE POWER IF I PUMPED THE BRAKES PRIOR TO COMING TO A STOP. MY SHOP COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM BUT FOUND 2 RECALLS - THE MASTER CYLINDER AND THE BRAKE BOOSTER. I CALLED MITSUBISHI BUT THEY SAID THESE RECALLS DID NOT APPLY TO MY SPECIFIC VIN. MY SHOP SUGGESTED I BRING THE CAR BACK WHEN I HAD THE PROBLEM AGAIN OR TO TAKE IT TO A DEALERSHIP.  THE MECHANIC SAID IN ALL HIS YEARS OF EXPERIENCE, HE HAS NEVER HAD TO CHANGE A MASTER CYLINDER ON A MITS EXCEPT FOR MINE. I DROVE A 1995 ECLIPSE FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS BEFORE THIS ONE AND NEVER HAD BRAKING ISSUES WITH IT. I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP. THEY ALSO COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM  AND SUGGESTED I BRING THE CAR BACK IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN SO THEY COULD TRY TO DETERMINE THE ISSUE WHEN THEY CAN EXPERIENCE IT FOR THEMSELVES. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE AGAIN THE LAST FEWS DAY AND HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS BUT I BELIEVE IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. I'VE ONLY HAD THE VEHICLE FOR ABOUT 1 YEAR AND IT IS UPSETTING TO ME THAT TWICE IN THAT PAST YEAR I HAVE SUDDENLY FOUND MYSELF W/O BRAKES. I KNOW THIS VEHICLE WAS IN A FRONT END IMPACT  ACCIDENT BEFORE I PURCHASED IT AND I  WONDER IF THE PREVIOUS OWNER HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  *KB",
