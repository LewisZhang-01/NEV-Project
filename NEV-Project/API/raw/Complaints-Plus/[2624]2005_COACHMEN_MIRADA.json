AFTER PICKING UP THE MOTORHOME, I CHECKED FOR RECALLS AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS ONE ON THE \"HITCH BRACKET ASSEMBLY\". IN CONTACTING THE DEALER I WAS INFORMED THAT THE RECALL HAD BEEN COMPLETED AND THAT I COULD CALL COACHMEN FOR CONFIRMATION. WHEN I CALLED COACHMEN THEY STATED THAT THEY HAD NOT TALKED TO ANYONE AT THE DEALER AND COULD NOT CONFIRM IF MY UNIT HAD BEEN CHECKED AND/OR REPAIRED. THEY STATED THAT FOREST RIVER RV PURCHASED COACHMEN RV AND THEY WERE PROHIBITED TO DISCUSS ANY RECALLS OLDER THEN 2009.  I AM AT AN IMPASSE AS I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF MY UNIT IS AFFECTED. I HAVE HAD ANOTHER RV DEALER CHECK IT AND GAVE THEM INFORMATION COPIES (SEE ABOVE) OF WHAT I COULD FIND ON THE INTERNET. THEY HAVE TRIED CONTACTING COACHMEN AND HAVE NOT HAD ANY LUCK IN GETTING AN ANSWER.  AS THIS IS A SAFETY RECALL, THIS SECOND DEALER SAID THAT I SHOULD NOT TOW ANYTHING OR USE THE HITCH UNTIL THIS PROBLEM IS RESOLVED, I FEEL THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR HELP.  *TR",
