        "summary": "While driving on the highway at night during mixed precipitation/icy conditions I noticed I was loosing visibility. I had to pull over on the highway to see if my headlights were on. I discovered they were completely covered in 1.5-2in of ice. The entire front grill of the truck was covered in ice. I had to chip off the ice on the headlights so I could see. I had to pull over three times during my 2hr drive to scrape the lights just so I could see! The headlights on the 22 model have shape, not straight or a smooth curve like prior models, which is part of the problem. Although, it was strange how the entire grill was covered in ice. I have always owned GMC or Chevy trucks and have never had anything like this happen. I wish I took a picture to send in but I didn't think of that in the moment.  This is absolutely a safety hazard. I hope in the near future there will be a recall to have this issue addressed.",
