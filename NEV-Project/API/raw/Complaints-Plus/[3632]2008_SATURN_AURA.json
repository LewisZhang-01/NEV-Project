Thirsty. Coolant leak but no service light. Car overheated for awhile but now doesn't. Wouod just shoot up to red zone. Got a call last night that it wasn't shifting right & sounded bad. Wks before randomly hard shifted. Our kid was stranded in the cold. Got to him & the car wouldn't shift from neutral. It rolled backwards on him & he threw on the parking brake thankfully!! Scary ordeal & thankful he is ok. When shifting gears, the shifter moved but sounds like it's not connected to anything & the gears don't shift. It stays in neutral. Car won't start. He also randomly has battery issues when his alternator & battery are good. Car just won't start randomly. It is available for inspection once we get it home.. I was led here thinking, it has to have recalls & we weren't notified then I saw recalls for this make & model, just not ours. No warning lights this time. Service engine has came on before them go off intermittently. We've had it connected at auto zone & fixed a few codes it through then service light went off. It's reduced engine power while driving & doesn't accelerate. Drives slow. Reduced power. All these previous issues now the shifting cable. :(",

Immediately, there was loss of power steering control. With great difficulty, I drove the car about 3 blocks and attempted to park. It took about 15 minutes to parallel park in a large space, with great difficulty. I turned off the engine and let the car sit for about 10 to 15 minutes, then restarted the car, which then seemed to be fine (at least drivable) -- though the check engine and traction control lights remained on. (Still, I was afraid to drive -- thinking the power steering could go out at any time, knowing it could easily result in no control of the car, grave danger, and serious accident. Anyway, with trepidation, I drove the car back home, where it has sat since.  I find the host of this car's repairs troublesome and expensive.

IMMEDIATELY THE ENGINE STARTED MAKING A LOUD TICKING NOISE WHICH CONTINUED AS I DROVE HOME ON SURFACES STREETS. UPON STARTING THE CAR THE NEXT DAY I HEARD A LIGHT KNOCKING NOISE. I DROVE TO THE CHEVY DEALER AND THE KNOCK GOT LOUDER.   THEY ADVISED TEARING THE ENGINE DOWN FOR $1,000 TO DETERMINE THE ISSUE. THEY SAID THERE WAS METAL IN THE OIL.   I BELIEVE MY ISSUES ARE THE SAME AS MANY 3.6LTR VVT ENGINE OWNERS, THE TIMING CHAINS AND SUPPORTS FOR THEM.  THE NOISE IS PERSISTENT AND VARIES IN TONE.   I HAD BARELY 50,000 MILES ON IT AND HAVE KEPT THE OIL CHANGES REGULAR, I EVEN HAD MOBILE 1 SYNTHETIC PUT IN ITS LAST OIL CHANGE.      I AM EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED AS THIS WAS MY FIRST AMERICAN MADE NEW CAR PURCHASE AND THERE WERE ONLY EIGHT MONTHS AFTER IT WAS PAID OFF WHEN THIS FAILURE OCCURED. I AM A USAF VET AND RETIRED FROM A CITY JOB OF 30 YEARS. AFTER SPENDING $32,000 ON THIS CAR, I EXPECTED SO MUCH MORE.",

I HAD A GM DEALER LOOK AT IT, AND THEY SHOWED ME THAT THE FRAME OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT IS CRACKED.  THEY HAD SEEN THIS BEFORE ON THE AURA, AS WELL AS OTHER SIMILAR CARS IN THE GM FAMILY (PONTIAC G6, FOR EXAMPLE).  THE CONCERN I HAD IS IF THE CR IS IN AN ACCIDENT, THE IMPACT COULD BREAK THE SEAT FROM THE FRAME, THUS BEING DANGEROUS FOR THE DRIVER, AND POSSIBLY THE PASSENGERS.    I HAVE SEEN IN VARIOUS ONLINE FORUMS, COMPLAINTS FOR THE SAME ISSUE.  IN SOME CASES, GM HAS REPLACED THE SEAT--EVEN IF THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  IN SOME CASES, GM DID NOTHING.  I SPOKE WITH GM, AND THE BEST THEY HAVE OFFERED ME IS A VOUCHER FOR A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS TOWARDS A NEW CAR, OR 10% THE INSTALLATION COST OF  NEW SEAT.    YESTERDAY (03/10/15), MY SON CALLED ME TO TELL ME THAT THE SEAT FRAME BROKE ALL THE WAY THROUGH, AND THE SEAT IS NOW VERY UNSTABLE--AND HE IS NO LONGER ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR.   FRANKLY, I WILL NOT LET HIM DRIVE THE CAR NOW THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED, AS IT IS VERY UNSAFE.  REPLACING THE SEAT COSTS APPRX. $800--I ONLY SPENT $5,000 ON THE CAR WHEN I BOUGHT IT.  WITH ALL OF THE ISSUES GM HAS FACED THIS PAST YEAR WITH RECALLS, I THINK  IT IS WORTH LOOKING INTO THIS ISSUE--ESPECIALLY SINCE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED THE SAME PROBLEM.    I DO NOT HAVE THE VIN AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW, AS I AM OUT OF TOWN FOR WORK. I CAN GET YOU THE INFO ON FRIDAY OF THIS WEEK (03/13/15), IF YOU NEED IT FOR REFERENCE.    ANY HELP THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE IS GREATLY APPRECIATED.    THANK YOU.    [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",

A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO SHE EXPERIENCED A DEAD BATTERY AND WAS ABLE TO HAVE A FRIEND \"JUMP START\" THE CAR AND AS FOR THE BATTERY, IT HAS BEEN FINE SINCE. THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THE TIRE PRESSURE MONITOR SYSTEM (TPMS) WAS INOPERATIVE AND WOULD NOT RESET MANUALLY. THESE TPMS, I BELIEVE, CAME ABOUT DUE TO THE INABILITY TO BE ABLE TO VISUALLY SEE THAT A TIRE IS \"LOW\" WITH TODAYS \"RUN FLAT', LOW PROFILE, AND STIFFER SIDEWALL, TIRES AND THAT THE MAJORITY OF DRIVERS DO NOT KNOW HOW TO CHECK TIRE PRESSURE ANYWAY. I WAS THEREFORE CONCERNED ABOUT MY DAUGHTERS SAFETY AS WELL AS OTHER THAT COULD BE INVOLVED IN A CRASH THAT RESULTED FROM POOR HANDLING OR WORSE, AN OVERHEATED TIRE AND BLOWOUT. I DID SOME SEARCHING AND DISCOVERED THAT GM HAD ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (TSB) EXPLAINING THAT THE TPMS FAILURE WAS DUE TO A \"LOW VOLTAGE\" INCIDENT THAT CAUSES THE CONTROL MODULE TO LOSE MEMORY. THE FIX, ACCORDING TO THE TSB, WAS TO REPROGRAM THE MODULE WITH UPDATED SOFTWARE. THIS BEING A KNOWN CONDITION AND SAFETY CONCERN, I DID NOT EXPECT TO HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR. I CONTACTED GM WHO REFUSED TO COVER THE REPAIR AND I ULTIMATELY PAID ABOUT $60. MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN ON MULTIPLE VEHICLES FROM GM INCLUDING MOST OF THE 08 SATURN LINE AS WELL AS THE PONTIAC G5 AND G6, AND CHEVY COBALT. I ALSO FOUND THAT NHTSA FOUND REASON FOR RECALL ON SOME GM SUV'S A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO DUE TO A PROGRAMMING ERROR ON THE TPMS WHICH IS WHAT THIS IS. AS THESE 08 CARS AGE THEY ARE NOW REACHING THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THEIR BATTERY AND REPLACING THEM WHICH IS CAUSING THE TPMS SYSTEM TO BE INOPERATIVE. I BELIEVE THAT GM SHOULD FOR SAKE OF THE SAFETY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS RECALL THESE AFFECTED CARS AND PREVENT FUTURE ACCIDENTS. SOME MAY HAVE ALREADY HAPPENED.   *TR",

TODAY, MY CAR IS IN THE SHOP TO FIX THE BRAKE LIGHTS, CRUISE CONTROL, AND TRACTION/ESC.  BRAKE LIGHTS:  ON MY WAY HOME FRIDAY, A CONCERNED CITIZEN HAD ME ROLE DOWN MY WINDOW EN ROUTE TO TELL ME THAT MY BRAKE LIGHTS STAY ON THE ENTIRE TIME I AM DRIVING.  AFTER THIS WARNING, I DID SOME INVESTIGATION - SURE ENOUGH, THE LIGHTS ENGAGE WHEN THE BRAKE IS NOT BEING PUSHED.  WORSE YET, THE BRAKE LIGHTS GO OFF WHEN THE BRAKE IS PUSHED.  THANK GOODNESS FOR THE PERSON WHO ALERTED ME TO THIS.  TRUTHFULLY, I AM LUCKY THAT I DID NOT GET REAR-ENDED OR GET A TICKET.  I TRULY HOPE THE BRAKE LIGHT ISSUE IS RECALLED BECAUSE IT IS VERY DANGEROUS.  CRUISE CONTROL:  MY CRUISE CONTROL DOES NOT WORK ALL THE TIME.  SOMETIMES IT WORKS; SOMETIMES IT ENGAGES THEN RANDOMLY DISENGAGES; SOMETIMES IT JUST PLAIN DOES ENGAGE AT ALL.  I CAN LIVE WITHOUT CRUISE CONTROL; HOWEVER, I REALLY DON'T THINK THIS SHOULD BE HAPPENING, AS THE VEHICLE IS NOT THAT OLD AND IS VERY WELL MAINTAINED.  TRACTION/ESC:  OCCASIONALLY, MY DASH WILL DISPLAY A WARNING THAT SAYS \"SERVICE TRACTION, SERVICE ESC, ESC OFF.\"  IT DOESN'T DO THIS EVERYDAY.  IT JUST DISPLAYS THE WARNING AT RANDOM TIMES - I CANNOT DISTINGUISH A PATTERN.  OVERALL, I AM VERY DISPLEASED WITH HOW THIS VEHICLE FUNCTIONS.  NOT ONLY DOES IT COST ME MONEY TO FIX, IT TAKES TIME OUT OF MY DAY - I GET PAID HOURLY AT MY JOB.  MY MAIN CONCERN IS THE BRAKES LIGHTS, AS SOMEONE COULD GET SERIOUSLY HURT, AND THE PROBLEM IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DETECT UNLESS ANOTHER MOTORIST WARNS YOU OR YOU DO NIGHT DRIVING (WHICH I DO NOT).

I TOOK THEM TO A CERTIFIED GM SERVICE STATION ON 4/5/2013 TO HAVE THEM FIXED FOR THE SECOND TIME.  I PICKED UP MY CAR FROM SAID REPAIRS ON 4/8/2013 TO ONLY FIND THAT ON 4/11/13 THE BRAKE LIGHTS WERE WORKING BACKWARDS AGAIN.  I TOOK MY VEHICLE BACK TO THE SAME GM SERVICE STATION TO HAVE THEM RE-RE-REPAIRED ON 4/13/13 AND PICKED THE CAR UP THE SAME DAY.

IT IS RIDICULOUS TO HAVE TO PAY THE EXORBITANT GAS PRICES BECAUSE THE PEOPLE AT GM ARE APPARENTLY ICOPATENT (WHICH HAS BEEN CORROBORATED BY THERE INABILITY TO MAKE A SAFETY RELATED REPAIR) THE US GOVERNMENT MUST FORCE GM TO RECALL THE VEHICLES AFFECTED BY THESE FAULTY BREAK LIGHTS AND FORCE THEM TO FIND A SOLUTION THAT WILL FIX THE POTENTIAL DANGEROUS PROBLEM.

I CONTACTED GM AND THE BEST THEY OFFERED WAS TO REPLACE ALL 4 LOCKS FOR HALF PRICE. THAT IS $500 INSTEAD OF $1000. WHILE I APPRECIATE THEIR OFFER,I KNOW FOR A FACT A REPLACEMENT ACTUATOR COSTS BETWEEN $5 AND $10, AND IT'S NOT ENTIRELY ABOUT THE MONEY. IT'S A MATTER OF RIGHT AND WRONG, SAFE AND NOT SAFE.
