I HEARD A WOMAN COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS SAME SITUATION THAT HAPPENED TO HER TWICE TO A  DEALERSHIP MECHANIC WHILE SHE WAS HAVING THE TRANSMISSION ON HER ELANTRA CHECKED OUT.

THIS WILL HAPPEN AT VARIOUS SPEEDS AND HAPPENS WHETHER OR NOT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON.  I HAVE PARKED THE VEHICLE AS IT FRIGHTENS ME TO DRIVE MORE THAN 20 MPH.  I USE MY VEHICLE FREQUENTLY FOR MY EMPLOYMENT AND HAVE BEEN RENTING A VEHICLE.  I BELIEVE THE PROBLEM IS NOT AS UNCOMMON AS IT APPEARS TO BE.  I HAVE READ NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON HYUNDAI (ACCENT)AND ELANTRAS WHERE THE PROBLEM I AM HAVING IS THE SAME.  I THINK THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS NOT ONLY TO THE DRIVER OF THE DEFECTIVE VEHICLE, BUT ALSO TO ANYONE WHO MAY BE FOLLOWING CLOSE BEHIND.  I HAVE HAD SOME CLOSE CALLS DURING THE DOWNSHIFT, BUT LUCKILY NO ACCIDENTS. I HAVE READ ARTICLES WHERE THE TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN REPLACED AS MANY AS FOUR TIMES IN ONE YEAR AND STILL THE PROBLEM WAS NOT FIXED.  AS YOU KNOW, TRUST WORTHY AUTO MECHANICS ARE A RARE BREED, AND I CAN NOT AFFORD TO GO THROUGH NUMEROUS PARTS REPLACEMENTS WHILE THEY TRY TO DETERMINE THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE.  ANY INFORMATION AVAILABLE SEEMS TO COST AT LEAST $24.95 TO OBTAIN AND I STILL DON'T KNOW IF I AM GETTING THE INFORMATION I NEED.  I KNOW THAT HYUNDAI IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HIDE THE DETAILS FROM CONSUMERS.

SENT TO LOCAL TIRE ALIGNMENT PLACE FOR 2 FREE TIRES AND ALIGNMENT WHEEL BALANCING FOR ALL 4 TIRES.  2 MONTHS LATER (10/98), CAR IS PULLING TO ONE SIDE, SOMETIMES THE OTHER...TIRE WORN AGAIN, REPLACED TIRE AGAIN AFTER 3,800 MILES DRIVEN ON NEW TIRES FREE OF CHARGE.  AGAIN ALIGNMENT AND BALANCING COMPLETED.  HAVE NOW PUT AN ADDITIONAL 12, 500 MILES ON THESE TIRES, PURPOSELY NOT ROTATING THIS TIME, AS I DID NOT WANT TO WEAR OUT FRONT, SWITCH TO REAR AND WEAR FRONT OUT AGAIN IN SHORT TIME.  I WANTED TO SEE HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO SEE WEAR.  CAR SHAKES BADLY OVER 55 MPH, ALSO PULLS TO ONE SIDE, BUT SWITCHES OCCASIONALLY AND WILL PULL TO OPPOSITE SIDE.  DEALER STATES PROBLEM DUE ONLY TO NOT ROTATING TIRES.  I STRONGLY DISAGREE AS THIS HAS BEEN 3 SETS OF TIRES RUINED IN 21,000 MILES.  SEVERAL TIRE ALIGNMENT REPS HAVE STATED THAT THEY ARE CONSTANTLY ADJUSTING ALIGNMENT TO HYUNDAI ELANTRA SPECIFICALLY, INCLUDING REP WHO MY DEALER HAS SENT ME TO.  ONE IN PARTICULAR STATED ALMOST IDENTICAL PROBLEM IN VERY SHORT TIME WITH SAME TYPE OF VEHICLE WITH ANOTHER CUSTOMER.  WILL BE GETTING A SECOND OPINION FROM ALIGNMENT REP OF MY CHOICE 4-28-99, BUT FEEL CAR IS VIRTUAL HAZARD AND ANTICIPATE CONTINUED PROBLEMS, EVEN IF TIRES REPLACED A 4TH TIME.  PLEASE ADVISE OF ANY SUGGESTIONS OR IDEAS YOUR DEPARTMENT MAY HAVE REGARDING MY SITUATION.  THANK YOU,  KIM CHRONISTER.  *AK",
