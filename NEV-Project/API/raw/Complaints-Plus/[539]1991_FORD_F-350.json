ONE YEAR WE TRADED PHONE CALLS AND NO PROGRESS WAS MADE. I CALLED BF GOODRICH CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS TOLD TO GO TO SEARS AUTO IN ALBANY, GA. THAT LASTED ABOUT THREE WEEKS, SAID THEY WERE UNABLE TO GET REPLACEMENTS. CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AGAIN THEY SENT ME TO SUNRISE FORD, SYLVESTER, GA. SUNRISE SAID THEY WOULD REPLACE THEM IF THEY KNEW THEY WOULD BE REIMBURSED. SO FAR NO AGENCY HAS BEEN WILLING TO GET THE REPLACEMENTS OR ARE UNSURE ABOUT REIMBURSEMENT. I WAS EVEN TOLD BY PETIS TIRES IN CORDELE, GA. TO WAIT AS LONG AS I CAN BECAUSE THESE ARE FREE MILES ON BAD TIRES. THE ORIGINAL LETTER FROM BF GOODRICH IN JULY 2012 RECOMMENDED GETTING THESE TIRES OFF THE ROAD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF  \"TREAD LOSS AND/OR RAPID AIR LOSS RESULTING FROM TREAD BELT  SEPARATION\". NOT MY IDEA OF GETTING FREE MILES ON RECALLED TIRES. TWO CALLS TO CUSTOMER SERVICE, THREE RECOMMENDED DEALERS, AND NO CALLS BACK, NO TIRES. NO PROBLEM, THESE ARE FREE MILES.  CUSTOMER SERVICE BF GOODRICH 1-800-637-5527.  PETTIS TIRE, CORDELE GA. 229-273-1153. FOR ONE YEAR THEY WOULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE MY REQUESTS. SAID THEY WOULD CALL THEIR SUPPLIER.

THREE WEEKS LATER HE WAS STILL BEING SENT THE WRONG TIRES FROM HIS SUPPLIER.  SUNBELT FORD, SYLVESTER, GA. 229-776-7691. DID NOT KNOW OF ANY RECALL, WILL CALL BACK. NEXT DAY THEY ASSURED ME THERE WAS A RECALL. THEY WOULD NOT ACT UNTIL THEY WERE SURE THEY WOULD BE REIMBURSED. FURTHER CALLS WENT NOWHERE.
