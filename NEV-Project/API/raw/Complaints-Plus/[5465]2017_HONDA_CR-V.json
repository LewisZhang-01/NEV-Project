        "summary": "I read an article saying you're investigating sudden braking on Honda's that have advanced safety features, I wanted to comment on my experiences as they are moderately dangerous.  There are 2 instances where my car will suddenly brake (and flash a warning on the dash) when it's not necessary:  1.  Going under a an overpass during the day.  The automatic braking system gets confused by shadows.  If the cruise is on, the car will brake, though not all the time.  Maybe half the time.  Almost all the time, I will get a warning to brake, even if there is no one else around.  2.  When I have the adaptive cruise control on and I'm on the highway in the right lane, if the car in front of me slows down to exit, 100% of the time my car will brake hard, and if I'm not paying attention to turn off the adaptive cruise, the hard braking and sudden declaration has nearly caused me to be rear ended.  It's not safe, I didn't know you were looking into this so I've been ignoring it since I've had the car.  Since you're looking into this, it has not caused an accident, but the hard braking is jarring and unexpected, both to me and people behind me.  And it's not necessary, because there's no risk of accident, someone is taking a highway offramp.  I have not brought this to a dealer to check out because it's happened since the first day I've owned the car.  Again, this is repeatable, it happens 100% of the time.  Hope this helps and I hope you can get Honda to issue a software update to fix this hard, unexpected braking.  Thank you.",

        "summary": "During a recent vacation my husband and I were on 95N just outside Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. My husband attempted to change lanes into the passing lane. As he depressed the gas pedal and turned into the lane, our Honda stalled and would not respond to any demand for acceleration. By the time we realized what was happening we'd gone from 65 miles per hour to about 30 miles per hour in a heavy flow of traffic, with oncoming traffic decelerating quickly and coming dangerously close upon the rear of our vehicle. There happened to be repairs to the left of our lane, with associated traffic cones so no cars were in that lane, and we were able to drift into that lane and restart our car. This happened once before on a very slow travel lane in my neighborhood and I didn't connect that the car had stalled. In retrospect this is the second occurrence. While I will certainly be taking the car for service at the Honda dealer, I also researched and found out that Honda is aware of this issue and does not deem it a safety issue, thus not using any sort of safety recall. My experience was harrowing, and certainly could have resulted in our own impact and indeed a larger impact on 95N after our stall.  This was no joke and luckily my husband did not panic and we were able to respond and drift to safety.  If that lane to our left had not been closed, no way could we have made it to the right side of the highway to the \"slow\" side of the road.",

        "summary": "On Thursday, February 17, 2022, I drove home from work in Waycross, Georgia. I was driving my properly-maintained 2017 Honda CRV. I was wearing my seat belt, and the shoulder harness was properly secured across my chest. The day was clear, and at 4:03 p.m., I approached the intersection of Jenkins St, Tebeau St, Plant Ave, and Francis St.  This intersection is in the downtown area; it is treated like a perpendicular intersection, although, as you can see from the attached photo, it is not, in fact, perpendicular. There are stop signs on Jenkins and Tebeau; travelers on Plant and Francis do not have to stop. Because of how Francis Street curves onto Plant, and because of the fact that Francis emerges from under an overpass, visibility is poor.  I was on Francis St, which becomes Plant Ave headed east. A construction worker driving a 2016 Chevy Silverado K350 TK was fully stopped at the stop sign at the Jenkins St intersection. After stopping, he pulled into the intersection, T-boning my CRV and sending it into a series of spins.   My head violently hit the window several times as the vehicle spun.  When the CRV finally stopped, my first thought was, \"Where are The airbags?\" Side curtain airbags had deployed on the passenger side of the vehicle, but no airbags had deployed on the driver's side anywhere--or from the steering wheel.  An ambulance took me to the local emergency room. I have a concussion. Had the airbags deployed as expected, that might not be the case.  My safety was put at risk by the airbags' failure to deploy--basic physics requires that in a  violent collision, the driver is protected after being propelled into the door and window.  The CRV is in a Copart lot. I have requested that it be kept available for inspection. The CRV was deemed totaled; I do not know if anyone inspected the airbags.  There were no prior warnings.   During the instrument panel went berserk. Multiple error messages flashed simultaneously, despite the front end not being hit.",

        "summary": "While in adaptive cruse control and traveling at highway speeds of 70 mph, I attempted to pass a slower moving semi tractor and trailer.  Just as I was about to complete the pass, with traffic building up behind me, the system went to automatic braking, as if there were traffic in front of me.  There was absolutely no traffic in front of me for at least a mile.  This occurred on a bright sunny day on a straight stretch of road.  I was able to apply excessive pressure to the gas pedal and slowly able to get the car up to highway speed again without getting rear ended.  This has happened on three occasions, always with passing a tractor trailer.  I have taken it to the dealer and they say they can find no problem.  In addition, more times than I can count, I have had the car alert me and apply the breaks when there are no cars in front of me or beside me during normal driving (no cruse control).  Lastly, almost without fail, if I am traveling at highway speeds using adaptive cruse control and the car in front of me takes an exit, my car will almost always break, even though the car that was in front of me is now clearly off on the exit.  These sudden slowdowns when the traffic behind me is expecting me to maintain speed or speed up is a real hazard for getting rear ended or having someone get hostile towards me with their driving.  Again, the dealer has been notified many times and indicates that they can find no problem.  I have now turned off ALL the automatic driving features to avoid these issues, but the second issue still remains and I am out over $3,000 for a group of electronic components in my car that I can not use due to safety issues.

Last week when I was driving on the Interstate Highway, All of sudden this warning flashed, after a while I stopped at a service station. Off/ On the engine but all of the 3 warnings didn't go off. From a safety point of view Cruise/Collision Mitigation/Collision Mitigation Control is very important on Highway. At-least these features prevent and keep you alert while changing lanes, apply proper braking system on the highway from safety measure. The vehicle has not been driven more than 42k miles in the last 4 years. Although the 3 year 36 miles standard warranty is already passed. Today when I went to the service center after diagnosticians they mentioned that the Cruise control sensor has failed due to these issues. Due to pandemic the supply chain is impacted and part is not available. So I ordered the part to the service center. The BRAKE SYSTEM light is also on. Similar issue occurred sometime in 2018 after purchase of the  new car in 2017. Initially I informed this issue to the service center. Case no was open with Honda - Case # 06624477. But the issue was not able to be replicated, the service center people told me that the software is updated and that it is not going to flash again. Looks like these new generation cars start creating problems once it completes its life cycle of 3 years and 36k miles warranty period. At least going for a new car was for peace of mind, but looks like this went the other way for me. Last 6 month back I had to get repaired the complete Air conditioner unit, service center people mentioned that AC hose pipe has leakage.",

I started the car.  Immediately \"System failures\" started scrolling across the dash system including Power Brake Failure. I called Honda service, explained what was happening, and Per the Honda service representative, I was told I could drive the car in.  I explained the car would not come out of park thus I could not drive it.  I was then told how to manually get the car out of park to drive it in for evaluation. I put it in reverse to get out of the garage and when I tried to stop the car I and had no brakes or steering.  I got the car to stop by standing with both feet and all my weight on the brake peddle.  I Had towed on  a flat bed tow truck into Ed Napleton Honda.  I was told by Honda that they have never seen this system failure without \"a rodent being involved\" as they chew threw the housing and then chew on the wires causing the electrical problem.  After about 36 hours I was called and told that they had to replace the Brake Power Booster sensor, \"no evidence of rodent involvement\" and no explanation of why the part failed. I was informed that  before further evaluation could be done there was no choice but to replace the Power Booster.  I was told it would be $2600.00 and that even if it was not the problem, I had to pay for the repair for they could continue the evaluation process. This is 3 X the cost of the part per another source I called. I also feel  I could have been killed/injured or killed and/or injured other people on the road if this had happened when I was driving as there was no pre warning of the problem and having the Certified Service Associate telling me to drive the car knowing that I had total system failure's scrolling across my dash.",

Battery fully discharged, requires being reset at a service facility because even after jumping the car, dash states that many of the functions will not operate. How stupid is that? VERY. Battery dead again in Dec. 2020, just under 13,000 miles. After jump, I traveled about 70 miles. After 2 days, dead again. Another 2 hr delay waiting for a jump and went directly to replace the battery. We bought the car new in Nov of 2017, this should not happen. The service person said that Honda puts in cheap batteries, so I attributed it to that until I read many of the NHTSA reports here with issue after issue being reported. Also, in summer of 2020, we noticed the air conditioning system seemed very weak.  I did not take any action at that time, not sure what to do about that.  Now in June of 2021, there is DEFINITELY A PROBLEM, no AC on these over 90 degree temp heat wave days.  One doesn't buy an expensive car to have problems like this.  Entering the car on a hot rainy day with the inside front windshield all fogging, you can't clear it without air conditioning. I couldn't drive the car until it cleared, which took a long time. I guess visibility isn't a high enough safety issue for Honda. And again after reading a hundred of these NHTSA reports, no need to read all 206, the pattern is clear.  I now see the number of problems I will most likely face, my gear shift knob falling apart, car suddenly breaking when no other cars are around, or when cars are behind me and slam into me. I will sell the car and move on to a different manufacturer. This is my first Honda, and will be my last. Honda doesn't give a crap about these incidents because there are MANY and they have done nothing.  I'm not even sure what the NHTSA does other than collect these if they don't hammer a company to fix repeating problems.  Maybe they just keep them for archives?

After owning it less than two weeks, my son was driving it with his brother in the front passenger seat and they luckily noticed the PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF LIGHT WAS STILL ON even though his brother is 145lbs and should easily activate the airbag system.  We took this to the Dealer and they stated that the air bag seat sensor was showing \"-19lbs with no one seated in it\" and not registering proper weight of passenger.  The dealership then reset the sensor mat, but the issue returned within 2 days of getting it back.  The Dealer is asking $1,000 to repair this as it is just over the 36 month warranty period.  The reason I am reporting this is I own a 2017 Porsche Macan and they have recalled it for the same reason and I see this as a safety issue for the passenger, not a regular repair.   Last it is concerning that a major safety system like this can fail in this situation and not show a code or alert the owner of the car better than this light.  This MAJOR safety issue relies on the owner/driver to notice the \"Passenger airbag off\" light is illuminated with a adult weight passenger onboard which is always on when there is no passenger in the car, so this seems like it can lead to situations like this when the system is not working as designed.  The location of the light and lack of any other warning can lead to this warning light being missed and people not being protected in an accident by the airbag.",

My next thought was to get out of my seat and look for it under my seat. When I took my foot off of the brake pedal, the vehicle started to roll because I was on a slight grade and still in neutral. I then set the parking brake to hold the vehicle while I searched for the missing button. I finally found the button and the spring that goes with it laying on the drivers side floor almost under the seat.  I observed the actuator and could see where it was actually broke, but I was still able to insert it back into the gear shifter handle and put the car into park and shut it off. To get home later, I had to wrap some electrical tape around the button so that it would not fall out again. When I got home, I could not turn my car off after parking because the electrical tape was preventing the actuation button from fully disengaging. I later removed the tape and covered the entire shifter knob with a small sock to hold the actuation button in. Currently looking into recalls and repairs.",

I WAS IN HEAVY TRAFFIC, DRIVING AT A SLOW AND STEADY RATE (ABOUT 20MPH OR LESS) AS I WAS GOING OVER THE ROUGH PATCH OF ROAD. THE CAR SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT MY PROMPTING BRAKED HARSHLY (AND THE SCREEN SAID BRAKE!) AND CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP ON THE METAL PLATES. IT WAS LIGHTLY DRIZZLING, BUT I HAD NOT BRAKED AS MY SPEED WAS ALREADY SLOW ENOUGH ON THAT ROAD.     I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THE CAR SENSED THAT THE PLATES WERE AN OBSTRUCTION ON THE ROAD AND AUTOMATICALLY BRAKED.     IT IS A MIRACLE THAT THE CAR BEHIND ME STOPPED IN TIME, AS MYSELF AND THE OTHER PASSENGER WERE THRUST FORWARD (WITH SEATBELTS ON) DUE TO THE FORCE OF THE DECELERATION. IT WAS A TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE AND I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROL OF THE CAR AT THAT POINT. THIS WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR A SUDDEN STOPPAGE IN FRONT OF ME, BUT TERRIFYING WHEN UNPROMPTED.

AT SOME POINT WHILE DRIVING NORMALLY THE FRONT DRIVER SIDE SEEMED TO HAVE COLLAPSE AND THE CAR STARTED PULLING STRONG IN ONE DIRECTION TOWARDS THE CENTER DIVIDER LINE. WITH TWO HANDS ON THE WHEEL THE PULL WAS SO STRONG THAT I WOULD BARELY CONTROL THE CAR AND KEEP IT FROM CRASHING INTO THE DIVIDER. BARELY MISSING THE DIVIDER I MANAGED TO STOP THE CAR ON THE SHOULDER LUCKILY WITHOUT ANYONE COLLIDING INTO ME. IF I WAS DRIVING IN THE MIDDLE LANE THIS COULD HAVE PROMPTED A MAJOR ACCIDENT. I DIDN'T GO OVER ANY POTHOLE OR OBSTRUCTION ON THE ROAD. NO ONE HIT ME NOR DID I HIT ANYONE. NO AIRBAGS INFLATED NOR WARNING INDICATORS APPEAR ON THE CONSOLE. I CALLED THE POLICE AND ONCE ON THE SCENE THE POLICE SWEPT THE HIGHWAY TO DETERMINE IF THERE WERE ANY POTHOLES OR OBSTACLES THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE INCIDENT. THEY CONFIRMED THAT NON EXISTED AND THAT THE ROAD WAS DEEMED SAFE. THERE WAS NO POLICE REPORT PRODUCED AS THE POLICE DEEMED THE INCIDENT TO BE A NON ACCIDENT AND INSTEAD A BREAKDOWN SINCE THERE WAS NO COLLISION OR ALTERCATION. WHEN LOOKING AT THE CAR DAMAGE THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE WHEEL, WHEEL WELL, RIM WHICH SPLIT UP VERTICALLY, ROTAR, SUSPENSION, WHEEL CALIPER, BRAKES (WHICH FELL OFF IN PIECES) AND BASICALLY EVERYTHING ATTACHED TO THE DRIVER SIDE WHEEL. THE VEHICLE NEEDED TO BE TOWED AS IT WAS NOT OPERATIONAL AT THAT POINT. WHEN BROUGHT BACK TO THE HONDA DEALER THE DEALER COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING REPORTED ON THE COMPUTER. THERE ONLY EXPLANATION WAS THAT THE CAR WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT. THE DEALER DID NOT WANT TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE OR FIND FAULT EVEN THOUGH THE VEHICLE WAS STILL COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY. THIS INCIDENT SEEMED TO BE A MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION THAT OCCURRED THAT ALMOST TOOK MY LIFE AND COULD BE A POTENTIAL SAFELY CONCERN FOR OTHER HONDA CR-V DRIVERS IF NOT PROPERLY INVESTIGATED.",

I ASKED THE HONDA TECHNICIAN TO CHECK FOR GASOLINE IN MY OIL, BUT THEY SAID NO SUCH TEST WAS AVAILABLE.  HE ADVISED ME THAT NO FIX CURRENTLY EXISTS, ASIDE FROM MORE FREQUENT OIL CHANGES.  I THEN FOLLOWED UP WITH THE LEAD TECHNICIAN AT MY DEALER TO RESOLVE THE SAFETY CONCERN, BUT I WAS VERBALLY TOLD THAT HONDA DOES NOT INTEND TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE UNLESS LITIGATION IS MANDATED.

I UNDERSTAND THAT  HONDA MOTOR COMPANY , LTD  HAS RECALLED 350,000 HONDA CRV'S IN CHINA BECAUSE OF THE SAME PROBLEM.

I WOULD LIKE HONDA TO BUY BACK MY VEHICLE UNLESS   I RECEIVED THE SAME REPAIRS AS THE CANADIAN HONDA OWNERS, WHICH ARE THE FOLLOWING:  1.) PERFORMED N60 CAMPAIGN (OIL DILUTION)  2.) REPLACED CLIMATE CONTROL UNIT   3.) REPLACED DRAIN PLUG WASHER   4.) REPLACED OIL   5.)  UPDATED PGM-FI AND TCM SOFTWARE.   6.) WARRANTY EXTENSIONS ON ALL ENGINE COMPONENTS FOR UP TO SIX YEARS FROM ORIGINAL DATE OF PURCHASE, WITH NO MILEAGE LIMIT.

THE DRAINED OIL WAS VERY BLACK IN COLOR AND TO THE TOUCH FELT LESS VISCOUS THAN NEW 0-20 OIL. IT APPEARS THAT THE INCREASED VOLUME IS DUE TO GASOLINE MIXING WITH THE OIL.

GAS SMELL IN THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT, THE OIL SMELL LIKE GAS, RISING OIL LEVELS, CAR MAKING HORRIBLE NOISES, STALLING, LOSS OF POWER AND THE HEATERS DOESN'T WORK AT ALL IN COLD WEATHER. I FIRST NOTICE THESE PROBLEMS 6 MONTHS AGO. A FRIEND OF MINE WHO PREVIOUSLY WORKED AT HONDA SAYS THAT THE PROBLEM OF FUEL MIXING WITH OIL STEMS FROM ONE OR TWO CAUSES: IMPROPERLY DESIGNED FUEL INJECTORS THAT SPRAY FUEL DIRECTLY ONTO THE CYLINDER WALLS OR THE ENGINE NOT HEATING UP ENOUGH TO VAPORIZE GASOLINE LEFT OVER IN AN ENGINE CYLINDER. EITHER COULD CAUSE FUEL TO MIX WITH THE OIL, DILUTING IT AND MAKING IT LESS EFFECTIVE AT PROTECTING AN ENGINE'S MOVING PARTS AND OVER TIME COULD SERIOUSLY DAMAGE THE ENGINE. MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS PREMATURE ENGINE FAILURE DUE TO THE LUBRICATION FUEL & OIL DILUTION. HONDA CORPORATION HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE TURBO ENGINE DEFECTS THAT CAUSE FUEL TO ENTER THE ENGINE OIL, DAMAGING THE BEARINGS, ENGINE PERMANENTLY AND DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS ETHICAL AT ALL FOR HONDA CORP. TO CONTINUE TO SELL 2017 & 2018 CRV WITH TURBO ENGINE TO THE CONSUMER KNOWING THE PROBLEMS COULD ENDANGER THE PUBLIC SAFETY. IT IS NEITHER SAFE NOR PRUDENT DRIVING THESE VEHICLES. MY TRUST IN HONDA RELIABILITY WAS CRUSHED WHEN I NOTICE AFTER MY 2ND OIL CHANGE THE COLOR WAS BLACK, THIN AS WATER AND SMELL LIKE GASOLINE AFTER ONLY 10,000 MILES. HONDA CORP. HAD TO RECALL 130,000 OF ITS POPULAR CR-V SUV MODELS AND 294,500 CIVIC CARS FROM CHINA EARLIER THIS YEAR. RECENTLY IT'S BEEN REPORTED HONDA STOPPED ALL SALES OF CRV'S IN CHINA. HONDA ACKNOWLEDGES THE PROBLEM BUT HAS NOT RELEASED ANY RESOLUTION ASIDE FROM FREE OIL CHANGES. MY ENGINE HAS ALREADY INCURRED PREMATURE WEAR.  *JS",

DRAINED ALL THE OIL AND REFILLED TO SPEC.\"  (AFTER 4,500 MILAGE, MY CAR'S OIL CHANGE HAD BEEN DONE BY ANOTHER HONDA DEALER ONE MONTH BEFORE.)   AS MY CAR WAS FINE, I WAS TOLD TO PICK IT UP.

ON ANOTHER OCCASION WE NOTICED THE SMELL AGAIN. I CHECKED THE FUEL FILL TUBE BUT FOUND NO PROBLEM THERE. I ALSO CHECKED UNDER THE HOOD AND DETECTED A FUEL SMELL BUT SAW NO EVIDENCE OF A LEAK. WHILE UNDER THE HOOD I CHECKED THE OIL AND SMELLED A STRONG FUEL SMELL IN THE OIL. THE FLUID LEVEL ON THE DIPSTICK WAS 7/8' ABOVE FULL LEVEL. I CHECKED AND DOUBLE CHECKED THE LEVELS AND SMELL AND THERE WAS DEFINITELY GASOLINE IN THE OIL. I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP (JOHNSON CITY HONDA IN JOHNSON CITY, TN) AND WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE 1.5L ENGINE WHEN IT WAS DRIVEN AT LOW SPEEDS AND SHOULD BE 'DRIVEN AT HIGHER SPEEDS ON THE FREEWAY TO 'BURN OFF' THE FUEL IN THE OIL'! (WE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM A 750 MILE INTERSTATE TRIP).THEY DID CHANGE THE OIL BUT THERE WAS NO RESOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. SINCE THEN THE OIL LEVEL HAS INCREASED TO ' ABOVE FULL LEVEL AND THE FUEL SMELL IS PRESENT. IN MY OPINION, GASOLINE IN THE OIL PRESENTS A SAFETY HAZARD IN THAT IT CAN IGNITE UNDER EXTREME HEAT CONDITIONS AND CAN CAUSE RESPIRATORY ISSUES WITH PASSENGERS WHEN THE SMELL MIGRATES TO THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT. I HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT HONDA HAS RECALLED APPROXIMATELY 350,000 OF THESE VEHICLES IN THE ASIAN MARKET, BUT THEY HAVE NOT MADE ANY ATTEMPT TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM IN THE U.S.",

I TRIED PUMPING THE BRAKE PEDAL, BUT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE. I THEN USED GREATLY INCREASED PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL, BUT WITH NO DISCERNIBLE EFFECT.  AFTER ABOUT EIGHT SECONDS OF CONTINUED EXTREME PEDAL PRESSURE, A YELLOW \"BRAKING SYSTEM\" WARNING LIGHT CAME ON, FOLLOWED  BY A RED \"BRAKE\" WARNING LIGHT ON THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER.  IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE APPEARANCE OF THE WARNING LIGHTS, A LOUD NOISE WAS HEARD, COMING FROM THE WHEELS, ACCOMPANIED BY A VIBRATION WHICH I INTERPRETED AS MODULATED BRAKING THAT COULD BE FELT THROUGH MECHANICAL FEEDBACK IN THE PEDAL. THE CAR CAME TO A STOP JUST IN TIME, BEHIND TRAFFIC THAT HAD BEEN WAITING AT A SIGNAL LIGHT. TEN SECONDS AFTER STANDING AT THE LIGHT, ALL WARNING LIGHTS EXTINGUISHED, AND THE BRAKES FUNCTIONED NORMALLY THEREAFTER.       WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALERSHIP FROM WHICH IT WAS PURCHASED FOR WARRANTY REPAIRS, THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEM, HAD RECENTLY ENCOUNTERED AN IDENTICAL CASE OF BRAKING SYSTEM FAILURE, BUT THAT HIS SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN UNABLE TO FIND THE FAULT OR ENACT REPAIRS.

THE INCIDENT HAPPENED ON MARCH 25, 2018 AT APPROXIMATELY 4:45 PM ARIZONA TIME.    I CALLED THE HONDA DEALER THE NEXT DAY TO REPORT THE INCIDENT. NO SERVICE MANAGER WAS AVAILABLE TO SPEAK WITH ME, AND THE RECEPTIONIST SAID THAT SHE WOULD LEAVE A MESSAGE WITH ONE OF THEM. I HAVE YET TO BE CALLED BACK, 4 WEEKS LATER. I WANT THE HONDA DEALER TO READ THE CODES FROM THE ONBOARD COMPUTER SYSTEM(S) TO 1) VERIFY THAT THE AUTOMATIC BRAKING SYSTEM ENGAGED, AND 2) SEE IF THERE IS ANY SUPPORTING DATA FOR WHY THE SYSTEM INCORRECTLY ENGAGED.    MORE IMPORTANTLY, I WANT TO REPORT THIS INCIDENT TO THE NHTSA. DOING AN INTERNET SEARCH TURNED UP SEVERAL OTHER PUBLIC REPORTS ON WEBSITES OF SIMILAR INCIDENTS. A FALSE POSITIVE FOR AN IMPENDING COLLISION WAS DETERMINED BY THE VEHICLE'S \"SMART SYSTEM\" ALGORITHMS, WHICH THEN TRIGGERED A PHYSICAL REACTION (AUTOMATIC INVOLUNTARY BRAKING).

THOUSANDS OF OWNERS WITH THE 2017-2018 CRV WITH THE 1.5 LITER TURBO ENGINE ARE HAVING THIS EXACT SAME ISSUE. THE ISSUE IS CALLED OIL DILUTION AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF GAS IS GETTING INTO THE OIL BUT THE REASONS ARE UNKNOWN. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED MY LOCAL DEALER AND HAD MY CAR IN THE NEXT DAY. THEY CLAIMED THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE AS MY OIL HAD SO MUCH GASOLINE IN IT THAT IT POURED OUT LIKE WATER. THEY SCHEDULED A CALL WITH HONDA ENGINEERS THE FOLLOWING MONDAY AND THEY WERE ADVISED TO CHANGE THE OIL AND DRIVE THE CAR AGAIN. THEY DID SO AND THE GAS VOLUME FILLED UP VERY QUICKLY IN THE NEW OIL SO THE NEXT STEP WAS TO REPLACE THE FUEL INJECTORS. BASED ON MY RESEARCH ONLINE MANY OTHER OWNERS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROCEDURE PERFORMED WHICH DIDN'T FIX THE ISSUE. HOWEVER THE INJECTORS WERE REPLACED ON MY CAR AND THE VEHICLE WAS GIVEN BACK TO ME, CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN FULLY FIXED. NEEDLESS TO SAY LESS THAN 2 WEEKS AFTER I GOT MY VEHICLE BACK I CHECKED THE OIL LEVEL AND ONCE AGAIN IT'S WELL ABOVE THE FULL MARK WITH A STRONG SMELL OF GASOLINE.

AFTER THE OIL CHANGE, I RESEARCHED THE ISSUE AND DISCOVERED THAT MANY PEOPLE (2017 HONDA CRV OWNERS WITH THE 1.5 TURBO ENGINE) IN THE USA HAD THIS PROBLEM. THE DETAILS ARE LISTED IN THE HONDA FORUMS AND ON EDMUNDS. I ALSO SAW THAT HONDA WAS RECALLING 350K 2017-2018 CRVS WITH THE 1.5 TURBO ENGINE , IN CHINA, AS THE SOFTWARE NEEDED TO BE UPDATED.  IT APPEARS THAT THE FUEL EJECTORS WERE SUPPLYING TOO MUCH GASOLINE AND THE RESIDUAL GASOLINE WAS LEAKING AROUND THE CYLINDERS INTO THE OIL. I REQUESTED HONDA-USA TO GET ACCESS TO THIS SOFTWARE UPDATE VIA MY LOCAL DEALER (BOCH HONDA WEST IN WESTFORD, MA). IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SOFTWARE UPDATE IS AVAILABLE. HONDA-USA SENT ME A RESPONSE INDICATING THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL ON MY VEHICLE AND I SHOULD GO BACK TO THE DEALER. I HAVE CALLED THE DEALER, AGAIN, BUT THEY CANNOT DO MUCH WITHOUT THE SOFTWARE UPDATE. I TOLD HONDA-USA THAT THIS PROBLEM IS VERY CONCERNING FOR THE FUTURE OF THE ENGINE REMINDED THEM THAT THEIR DEALER FOUND THE PROBLEM OF GASOLINE IN THE ENGINE AND THAT BOTH I AND THE DEALER WERE CONCERNED.

REUTERS REPORTED IN FEBRUARY THAT HONDA HAS ANNOUNCED A RECALL OF 350,000 CR-V'S IN CHINA FOR WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SIMILAR ISSUE.    WE'VE DRIVEN OUR CAR FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS, AND IT HAS LESS THAN 2,000 MILES ON IT. WE TYPICALLY USE THE CAR FOR SHORT DRIVES WITHIN THE CITY.

IT HAD A DEAD BATTERY!  SO AN ONE AND A HALF LATER THE TOW TRUCK ARRIVED TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND I HAD TO GET A RIDE HOME AND TO AND FROM WORK THE NEXT DAY.    HONDA SERVICE CALLED ME THE NEXT DAY AND SAID THAT THEY CHARGED THE CAR BATTERY AND THAT THE CAUSE WAS A PARASITIC DRAIN AND THAT I NEEDED TO PUT THE ELECTRIC BRAKE ON BEFORE I TURNED OFF THE CAR. THEY TOLD ME THAT HONDA WAS AWARE OF THIS ISSUES AND THAT THEY WERE WORKING ON A SOFTWARE FIX....    WELL TONIGHT (FRIDAY - AUG. 18TH, 2017) AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO OUT, THE CAR AGAIN HAS A DEAD BATTERY. NOW I'M STUCK HOME UNTIL TOMORROW WHEN I WILL HAVE TO SPEND SATURDAY TRYING TO GET THE CAR DRIVEABLE BY HONDA.    SO I HAVE A NEW CAR (WITH 9300 MILES) I CAN'T DRIVE!!!    WHAT HAPPENS IF I HAVE AN EMERGENCY?    HONDA - IF YOU HAVE A FIX (WHICH I SEE ON SERVICE BULLETIN A17-032), WHEN CAN I GET MY CAR FIXED SO I CAN HAVE A CAR I CAN RELY ON?
