The shuddering continued to get worse and at (79058 miles) I was told that the clutch could be replaced for $3000.00, and nothing was covered under any warranty. Even though continued complaints about this model to Ford On 8/27/2018 the shutter was determined to be related to the recall module 955442 causing shift issues (86575 miles). I was advised to watch nothing else stated.  Still issues. It was then determined that the clutch assembly would need to be replaced. Claim number  through Ford stated they would pay for the parts and I would have to pay the labor. No one at this time stated that there was a Ford DPS6 Powershift Transmission Settlement that gave options to deal with this vehicle. Not even when getting the CAS#. This was to cover all 2012-2016 Ford Focus Vehicles.  The clutch was replaced on 4/11/2019 (91195 miles) and then again replaced on 7/30/2019 (100,379 miles) A 2nd clutch assembly was put in because there were issues from the 4/11/2019 clutch assembly parts put in.  Now on March 21, 2022 (176,000 miles) the vehicle again in in the shop for a 3rd time stating the clutch will need to be replaced. Engine light came on relating to the DPS6 clutch again. Unable to drive had to be towed.  This will be the 3rd time the clutch is replaced and is getting just over 75000 miles again where the clutch gives out and the car shutters while accelerating.  The original clutch was to be covered to 100,000 miles and was not covered and now again Ford is stating it won\u2019t be covered again. And that yes this is a DPS6 Transmission and that they will need to replace the shift fork and the clutch. This is a vehicle hazard because the clutches are not making the original 100,000 at any time for these models 2012 - 2016. Even when the clutch is replaced again the parts don't last.",

As I drove home a loud rattle was coming from the engine while idling causing the whole dashboard to shake. The clock was also now pushed 2 hours and 3 minutes ahead which was odd. I continued to drive the few miles to home. The next day I drove 20+ miles to Baltimore for an appointment.  While there I stopped for gas. When I pushed the remote door lock button, the lights blinked, the door locks clicked but the horn did not beep twice as it usually does.  I hit the door lock button several times but the horn did not beep so now the horn was not working.  Before I took my car to Apple Ford it was working.  I went to my appointment and parallel parked on the street. When leaving I had a hard time getting my car out of the parking space.  As I drove I noticed the car was jerking, shaking, shuddering, vibrating and lunging every time I slowed down, came to a stop, then accelerated again and getting on and off the highway.  While on I-95 the car continued to jerk, shake, shudder, vibrate and lunge and the RPM gauge needle shot over to high RPMs over and over again. Then the engine light came on. I exited I-95 onto Rt. 216 then a 2nd emergency warning sounded and another message came on that the transmission was overheating pull over immediately.  I pulled over, called Apple Ford, told Service Rep #1 what happened, AAA was towing the car back. He said it was probably the Transmission Controller, they had several other Ford Focuses with the same problem. On 3/14 I called and spoke to Service Rep #2, he didn't even know the car was there. I told him what that happened. Rep #2 called back said he took it for a test drive and found nothing. I insisted there was something wrong. He said he'd take it for a test longer drive. Called again 3/18 they are referring problem to a manager. No resolution as of yet.",

        "summary": "On 08/18/2021, the Transmission Control Module (TCM) on our 2014 Ford Focus failed completely in a parking lot with NO ADVANCE WARNING. This failure of the transmission could have happened while driving in a dangerous location such as an entrance ramp, a busy highway or other location where it would have been impossible to move out of the traffic lane. THIS LACK OF ENGAGEMENT OR LOSS OF POWER COULD HAVE POSSIBLY ENDANGERED OUR LIVES OR THE LIVES OF OTHERS. The car was towed to a nearby Ford dealer who diagnosed the problem as a failed TCM. Ford sent us a letter in August 2016 titled as \u201cCustomer Satisfaction Program 14M02\u201d for our specific 2014 Focus, with our specific VIN # that Ford was extending the warranty of the TCM, to a total of 10 years or 150,000 miles from the warranty start date, whichever occurs first.   The Ford dealer ordered the TCM, but it is STILL ON BACKORDER with no estimated arrival time. The car has been unusable & sitting at the dealer\u2019s lot WAITING FOR THE REPLACEMENT TCM FOR 4-1/2+ MONTHS! According to the Detroit Free Press article of 07/11/2019 (\u201cFord knew Focus, Fiesta had flawed transmission, sold them anyway\u201d), Ford was aware of the problem. The serious transmission reliability issues with my 2014 Ford Focus go beyond just the TCM. The original TCM was reprogrammed after 30,000 miles. In the 126,728 miles the car has been driven, I have had the CLUTCH REPLACED FIVE TIMES due to SHUDDER DURING SHIFTING. In my opinion, it is a BREACH OF CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS WHEN FORD DOES NOT HONOR THEIR WARRANTY IN A TIMELY MANNER. That indicates to me that Ford hasn\u2019t taken ownership of these transmission problems and has DELAYED/NEGLECTED ITS DUTY TO REPAIR & MAKE THE CAR SAFE & RELIABLE. NHTSA should launch an investigation and force Ford to fix this transmission design failure before we and/or others become seriously injured or die because of the inadequate performance of this car\u2019s transmission.",

Recall transmission repairs have been done at this same dealership in the past. I was unable to drive the car and was given an appointment to drop the car off on October 18, which I did. I immediately requested a loaner vehicle and was told one wasn\u2019t available. After, several weeks I was approved to receive a rental through Enterprise but cannot use that rental care company due to owing a balance. I had a similar issue in the past with Geico, who immediately allowed me to rent a car through Hertz.  I was eventually informed I could rent with another car rental company and receive reimbursement. However, I did not receive this information in writing, and it would incur thousands of dollars upfront with no clear standard on the rental process or when I will receive reimbursement. This is not feasible considering I am still paying the monthly note to Navy Federal Credit Union and the insurance while the car is inoperable.  I would also like to make it known I am a Registered Nurse and frontline worker and must travel from Locust Grove to Decatur to work, at least 40 miles one way. This hardship has created tension at my workplace because I cannot take any time off due to the pandemic. There is also tension in my relationships as I beg for rides and provide them cash, increasing my debts. I have done an online buyback quote with Carmax, and in working condition, they will pay $8000 for the vehicle, which will cover the remaining loan balance. Since it has been almost three months with no anticipated end date due to the needed transmission module, suitable options include Ford to buy back the vehicle, provide compensation, and a rental car.",

The visual screen that displays the SYNC system stops working, and the buttons and A.I. controlling it stop working. The first time it happened was on the interstate and was very unsafe with all the loud random noises. It has been happening off and on for two weeks and I cannot drive my vehicle safely. I am reporting this because have found many others in online forums complaining about the same thing about their SYNC/Ford vehicles and believe it may be a widespread issue with SYNC.

I suffer physically, emotionally,financially going without medical supplies, medication. I pay $209.97 a mo.for a car that almost killed me, sits at auto collision where malfunction codes were obtained since 2018 to date, its evidence. A state investor detective said its the worse case of auto fraud she ever saw. Ford is blaming 3rd party suppliers for the defects on the suit. No inspection was done on my car from incompetent deceitful former attorneys. They blame me! I didn't do this! Read article, Watch the NBC nightly News 15 minutes in Links below. I was lied to, deceived from salesman,former attorneys, & Ford. The NBC nightly news aired 2019 Ford knew car was assembled dangerously,but put it in production! Ford took my life, identity,trust, mobility! This is injustice and inhumanity. Permanent injuries deteriorate my body, stress causes further health issues. Ford is killing what life I have left by torturing me. I wont give up on Justice! Please help!

I scheduled for an appointment to have the vehicle serviced on October 18th 2021(closest time available).  During the two week period I had noticed when I pumped gas that the engine seemed to have stalled when I tried to turn on the ignition. The second time the vehicle finally turned on but there was a low rumble noise. I gassed up a second time and I just heard a low rumble from the vehicle when I started the ignition. on 10/16/2021, I was low on gas but my low tank sensor did not go off so I figured I was okay to drive until I came to a gas station. My vehicle ended up stalling on a freeway while I was driving and I started to decelerate from 65 MPH to 60 and slowly decreasing. Nearly avoiding an accident I had my hazard lights on and slowly made my way to the emergency lane where I came to a complete stop and called for a tow.  Upon getting my car serviced they determined that I needed a new fuel tank, fuel pump and purge valve due to the tank being warped. I had run out of gas, but my gauge and sensor did not detect that. Apparently this was a recall item a few years back but the manufacture said that my VIN was not on the recall list so I will have to pay this out of pocket.",

It's running real rough on idle all of which are signs of this recall but because it's not covered under my car I'm having to pay $100 just to put the car in the shop to have them look at it and tell me what I already know and then I'm going to have to pay whatever it costs to repair it which I'm sure it's going to be 3 to $500 for a problem they've already admitted to lying about before and obviously are lying about now when they say that this series of Ford focus 2014 was not affected so now I have to pay out of pocket for being a Ford customer so I hope it's worth it to them to lose me as a customer for the rest of my life because of something that would have cost them two or $300. And my family for generations have been lifelong ford buyers my family is well known at our local trotter Ford my grandparents literally buy a new car every year and say they're taking their business elsewhere after finding out about this so I don't see where they think they're saving money by lying like they are.",

After the long 2 hours, I am informed that they replaced the 2 front door latches, then they proceed to tell me that the recall is only for the front doors and that I would have to pay out of pocket to get the rear latches done. Confused, I show them the statement from the Ford and NHTSA website that states, \"OWNERS WILL BE NOTIFIED BY MAIL AND INSTRUCTED TO TAKE THEIR VEHICLE TO A FORD OR LINCOLN DEALER TO HAVE ALL AFFECTED DOOR LATCHES REPLACED WITH A MORE ROBUST SERVICE PART. THERE WILL BE NO CHARGE FOR THIS SERVICE.\". To this day, I am still being told that same information from them that it is not covered in that recall. I am now stuck and don't know what to do since I cannot get the work done any where else because of my location. I have tried using the Chat Now feature on Fords' website without any luck.",

I barely managed\u00a0to get the car home however the transmission began to lose power and the transmission service light came on. I later inspected the car and noticed the breather tube had come lose on top of the transmission most likely\u00a0due to shuttering.

While accelerating as the car would automatically switch gears the car would hesitate as if it weren't taking fuel then jerk into gear to keep moving normally. Once at work I was able to park the car and look at the engine and noticed nothing out of the ordinary. At about noon that day I got into the car to leave for lunch only to realize that I could no longer go into reverse. I would move the shifter from park to reverse then press the gas pedal to begin moving only to seem like I'm still stuck in park. I was able to put the car in Drive however I was in a parking spot facing a building and would not be able to exit only utilizing Drive. I was able to switch the car into neutral and push the car out of the parking spot by hand then drive off with there still being hesitation when the gears switched. I theorize that there may be an issue with the Power Train Control Module within the vehicle not allowing the clutch to shift effectively and a possible imbalance of fuel to air intake.",

I WAS GOING 40 WHEN I WAS TRYING TO SPEED UP TO AT LEAST 60, I HELD MY FOOT ON THE ACCELERATOR AND MY CAR DID NOT PICK UP SPEED, IT DIDN'T GAIN SPEED, IT ACTUALLY DROPPED DOWN TO 35MPH. AFTER ABOUT 20 SECONDS MY CAR THEN PICKED UP SPEED AND I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO GO 60MPH +. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION TO BE IN, ESPECIALLY ON THE HIGHWAY. THE CLUTCHES DO NOT LAST LONG AND CONSTANTLY HAVE TO BE REPAIRED, FORD EXTENDED WARRANTY IS A JOKE, I HAVE A 2014 AND EVEN THOUGH IT IS ONLY AT 53,XXX MILES, BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SEVEN YEARS I AM OUT OF LUCK WHEN IT COMES TO REPAIRS. I CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY $1,500 + EVERY COUPLE THOUSAND MILES WHEN THESE CLUTCHES GO.

THAT SAID, FORD NEEDS TO PROVIDE EITHER A LOANER OR A RENTAL AT THEIR EXPENSE, NOT MINE.

THIS PARTICULAR CAR HAS NOW HAD THREE CLUTCHES PUT IN AND IT DRIVES LIKE A NIGHTMARE. NO WONDER WHY THE 1ST OWNER GAVE UP ON IT AFTER 33K MILES AND 2 CLUTCHES LATER!

WAS IN AN ACCIDENT WHEN CAR WOULDNT ACCELERATE QUICKLY AT.LIGHT. HIT FROM BEHIND AND PASSENGER HAD TO BE TAKEN BY AMBULANCE. RECEIVED TWO RECALL LETTERS IN THE MAIL. ONE REGARDING EMISSIONS AND ONE REGARDING THE CLUTCH.  WHEN I TRIED TO BACK CAR OUT OF LOT, WOULDNT GO IN REVERSE. THEN THE TRANS  LIGHT CAME ON WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT.  WE PUSHED IT OUT OF SPOT AN IT DROVE UNTIL I TRIED TO ACCELERATE, CAR WOULDNT GO.  CAR HAD ALL TUNEUPS, OIL CHANGES,ALL MAINTENANCE ROUTINELY DONE.  WHEN SPEAKING WITH UNIVERSITY FORD ON A RECORDED CONVO, TOLD ME THE RECALL EFFECTED MY CAR & THAT THEY INSTALLED A NEW TRANS MODULE BUT THE TRANS ITSELF HAD TO BE REPLACED. QUPTED 7,000$. WARRANTY ACCORDING TO FORD IS FOR CLUTCH PROBLEM. THEN WHY REPLACE TRANS MODULE?  TOLD ME TO CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE. TOLD ME TO MAKE CLAIM &GET A TRANS EXTENDED COVERAGE CLAIM. I'VE CALLED BUT HAVEN'T HEARD BACK. NOW IHAVE CAR AT DEALERSHIP DONT HAVE 7,000$ OR $ TO EVEN TOW IT AWAY FROM THERE.

MY 2014 FORD FOCUS HAD A HISTORY OF SLIPPING WHEN SHIFTING, BUT I DID NOT TAKE IT INTO THE DEALER FOR A DIAGNOSTIC UNTIL MY REGULAR MECHANIC NOTICED IT AND RED FLAGGED IT AS A CONCERN WHILE OPERATING THE VEHICLE. I TOOK THE CAR TO MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND PAID $160 TO RUN A COMPLETE DIAGNOSTIC OF THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM. THE RESULT OF THAT DIAGNOSTIC WAS THE INTERNAL CLUTCH WAS BAD, AND I WOULD NEED TO DO A COMPLETE REBUILD OF BOTH  THE CLUTCH AND THE TRANSMISSION, BECAUSE THE CLUTCH IS LOCATED INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION, AT A COST OF $3,081.77. AFTER RECOVERING FROM STICKER SHOCK, I WAS TOLD IT WAS OK TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE CAR UNTIL THE CLUTCH STOPPED WORKING AS THEY ANTICIPATED FAILURE IN THE LOWER GEARS. AFTER THIS INFORMATION, I REACHED OUT TO TWO TRANSMISSION REPAIR CENTERS FOR A SECOND OPINION, BOTH WHICH TOLD ME THAT FORD HAS BEEN REPAIRING ALL THE TRANSMISSIONS THEY HAVE SEEN WITH THIS PROBLEM AT NO COST TO THE OWNER. IN ADDITION, THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO PURCHASE THE REPLACEMENT PARTS LISTED IN THE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS BECAUSE FORD IS NOT SELLING THEM TO OUTSIDE REPAIR HOUSES BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF REPAIRS FORD IS MAKING ON THIS TRANSMISSION. TODAY THE CLUTCH FAILED AND I COULD ONLY USE THE LOWER TWO GEARS TO LIMP MY CAR BACK TO THE DEALER, AGAIN BEING QUOTED THE ORIGINAL REPAIR PRICE. THE DEALER SERVICE REP IS TELLING ME FORD IS EITHER REPAIRING FOR FREE OR SOMETIMES CREDIT UP TO 50% OF THE REPAIRS, MILEAGE DEPENDANT. WHEN I CALLED THE NUMBER THE DEALER PROVIDED, I WAS ASSIGNED CASE # CAS22256019 AND TOLD 0% WOULD BE CREDITED BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO RECORD OF A PROBLEM.

VEHICLE HAS BEEN TO DEALERSHIP 9 TIMES FOR SHUTTERING/SHAKING, NO RESPONSE WHEN PUSHING ACCELERATOR PEDAL, SURGING FORWARD SEVERAL SECONDS AFTER PUSHING ACCELERATOR PEDAL FOLLOWING NO RESPONSE, HESITATION WHEN PUSHING ACCELERATOR PEDAL.  FORD HAS REPLACED THE CLUTCH 4 TIMES IN THE PAST 5 YEARS AND THE PROBLEMS RANDOMLY PERSIST.  THE VEHICLE IS AT DEALERSHIP NOW FOR MOST RECENT CLUTCH REPLACEMENT. FORD HAS UPDATED THE TCM/PCM AT LEAST 4 TIMES AND THE SAME PROBLEMS STILL RECUR. AFTER THE UPDATES TO THE TCM/PCM AND/OR CLUTCH REPLACEMENTS WE'VE CONTINUALLY BEEN TOLD THAT THE ROAD TESTS ARE WITHIN FORD SPECIFICATIONS BUT THE PROBLEMS CONTINUE.  IN THE MOST RECENT OCCURRENCE ON 7/1/19, MY DAUGHTER WAS TURNING LEFT ONTO A BUSY ROAD WITH CARS TRAVELING AT 50 MPH; HER FOCUS STARTED INTO THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC LANE THEN HESITATED WHILE THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WAS PRESSED AND THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT RESPOND. THE CAR COMING TOWARD HER HAD TO SLAM ON HIS BRAKES TO AVOID T-BONE COLLISION. HER FOCUS FINALLY RESPONDED AND SHE WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE THE TURN, BUT SHE CAME CLOSE TO BEING SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED. UPON HEARING THIS SITUATION, I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE FORD DEALERSHIP TO BRING THE CAR IN.  IN JUNE, 2018, AT A STOP LIGHT THE FOCUS WOULD NOT RESPOND WHEN PRESSING THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL, THEN AFTER SEVERAL SECONDS IT LUNGED FORWARD AND ALMOST HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF HER.    I BOUGHT THIS CAR NEW FOR MY DAUGHTER. AFTER READING THE 7/12/19 DETROIT FREE PRESS ARTICLE, IT'S CLEAR THIS IS A FLAWED DESIGN. MY DAUGHTER WILL NEVER DRIVE THIS VEHICLE AGAIN. IT'S A TICKING BOMB. IT NEEDS TO BE RECALLED.",

I COULD NOT DRIVE IT AWAY BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE A SECOND DRIVER AND THE AUCTION WAS 1 HOUR AWAY.  I PICKED UP THE CAR TWO DAYS LATER.  WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN GEAR AND STARTED DRIVING, I IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THE CAR SHUDDERING/STUTTERING.  THIS HAPPENED EVERY TIME I CAME TO A STOP AND TRIED TO ACCELERATE FROM STOP OR MERGE INTO TRAFFIC.  THE VEHICLE TAKES LONG TO ACCELERATE AND SHAKES WHILE TRYING TO PICK UP SPEED.  I WAS AFRAID AND STILL AM AFRAID THAT IT WAS GOING TO STALL.  I'VE SINCE GONE ONLINE TO DO SOME RESEARCH AND I AM FINDING THAT THIS SEEMS TO BE A UNIVERSAL PROBLEM FOR THIS CAR.  NOW, I KNOW AUCTION CARS ARE SOLD AS IS, AND I UNDERSTOOD THIS WHEN I BID FOR THE CAR BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE A MANUFACTURER DEFECT THAT HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED BY THE MANUFACTURER ON MANY OF THESE CARS.  THE PROBLEM IN MY CASE IS THAT I BOUGHT THIS CAR AS A SURPRISE FOR MY 16 YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WHO IS SOON GOING TO BE 17 AND IS DUE TO TAKE HER ROAD TEST.  WITH THE TYPE OF ACCELERATION AND STALLING ISSUES BEING REPORTED ONLINE, HOW CAN FORD NOT TAKE ACTION TO RECALL/AND OR FIX THE PROBLEM.",

THEY ALSO INDICATED THAT THEY AREN'T SURE IF THE TRANSMISSION WOULD BE REPAIRED AGAIN, AND IT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW 'BAD' IT IS.     THIS IS A COMPLETELY UNSAFE VEHICLE, WHICH I AM STILL PAYING FOR, AND IS UNUSABLE AT THIS TIME, UNLESS I DECIDE TO DRIVE IT IN UNSAFE CONDITIONS.

HOWEVER OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS AFTER TWO MORE CLUTCH REPLACEMENTS THE TRANSMISSION/ENGINE CEASED WHILE DRIVING IN TOWSON MD INNER CITY STREETS. THE FIRST BEING EXACTLY OVER TWO WEEKS AGO AND WHICH A NEW CLUTCH WAS INSTALLED. I PICKED UP THE VEHICLE AND TWO DAYS LATER CALLED THE DELEARSHIP STATING IT IS STILL NOT DRIVING RIGHT. I COULD FEEL SOMETHING WAS WRONG. I NOTICED SUDDEN JERKS AND WHAT SEEMED LIKE THE TRANSMISSION WAS WEARING OFF AGAIN. I WAS INFORMED BY THE SERVICE PERSON MIKE MAZOR THAT THIS IS NORMAL AND THE ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS WILL HAVE TO GET USED TO MY DRIVING PATTERN AND TO GIVE IT 1000 MILES. I EXPRESSED MY CONCERN THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE BECAUSE THE VEHICLE FELT UNSAFE TO DRIVE. TWO DAYS LATER WHILE TRAVELING ON INTERSTATE ROUTE 40, THE CAR SUDDENLY DECELERATED, MADE A LOUD ROARING SOUND AND WHEN I PUSHED ON THE PEDAL IT SEEMED AS IF IT WAS ON NEUTRAL AND DID NOT WANT TO MOVE. ALL I HEARD WAS THE ENGINE RERVE. EXTREMELY PANICKED AND SCARED I QUICKLY MOVED OVER TO THE YELLOW LINE WITHOUT CAUSING AN ACCIDENT OR INJURING MYSELF. I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DELEARSHIP CLOSEBY AS I FELT VERY UNSAFE DRIVING ANY FURTHER.   I WAS INFORMED TODAY BY ALPACKER FORD THAT THEY WORKED ON THE VEHICLE AND THE ENGINE LIGHT IS NO LONGER ON, THE CAR RUNS JUST FINE. THEY WILL BE DOING ONE MORE TEST TOMORROW TO SEE IF THEY CAN REPLICATE THE PROBLEM. I'M TOTALLY BAFFLED AS TO HOW THE ENGINE LIGHT TURNED OFF OR WHY THEY CAN'T FIND THE ISSUE.

THERE IS NEVER BETTER GAS MILEAGE THAN 28 MPG. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR A 4 CYLINDER VEHICLE THAT IS ADVERTISED AS 33 AVERAGE MPG.   I HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME REGISTERING, FILING FOR, AND DOCUMENTING NECESSARY REPAIRS FOR THE CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT AND EVENTUAL ARBITRATION. THE LOCAL FORD DEALER HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH AND WE ONLY HAVE ONE ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE BIG ISLAND OF HAWAII, WHERE I LIVE. THIS HAS BEEN A HUGE INCONVENIENCE AND I HAVE TO RENT A CAR EVERY TIME I TAKE THE FOCUS IN FOR REPAIRS. FORD HAS REPLACED THE CLUTCH WHICH HAS IMPROVED THE SHIFTING TO SOME DEGREE, BUT NOT MITIGATED THE PROBLEMS, COMPLETELY. THE CAR IS GOING IN FOR A THIRD EVALUATION AS IT IS STILL STAYING IN FIRST GEAR FOR AN INAPPROPRIATELY LONG TIME AND BUCKING AT LOW SPEEDS. I HAVE REQUESTED THAT FORD REPLACE OR REPURCHASE THIS VEHICLE. SO FAR, SO BAD.  THE \"DEAL\" FORD OFFERED ME WAS NOTHING, AFTER I FILED MY PAPERWORK. I AM WAITING TO BE ASSIGNED AN ARBITRATOR, BUT THAT HAS BEEN STALLED BY A THIRD PARTY IN COLORADO, WHO WANTS THE RULES OF ARBITRATION CHANGED. I HAVE READ THE ENTIRE ARBITRATION DOCUMENT AND IT FAVORS FORD, OF COURSE. HOWEVER, IF THEY OFFER TO REPURCHASE OR REPLACE THIS VEHICLE, I WOULD BE AGREEABLE TO THAT. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT MORE THE COLORADO PEOPLE WANT, BUT IT IS STALLING ALL OF US WAITING FOR OUR CHANCE AT ARBITRATION.

THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE TO FORD AND THEY ARE CLAIMING THAT IT IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE TRANSMISSION AND IT IS NORMAL ACTIVITY.   THE TRANSMISSION SHUTTERS AND JERKS SO MUCH THAT THE CAR WILL NOT SHIFT AND WILL NOT MOVE FORWARD APPROPRIATELY AND I HAVE COME CLOSE TO GETTING REAR-ENDED SEVERAL TIMES BECAUSE THE TRANSMISSION CANNOT CATCH UP WITH THE ACCELERATION.   I AM ASKING FORD FOR ASSISTANCE IN TRADING THE CAR IN SINCE THE VALUE IN THE CAR DEPRECIATED SO MUCH BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE TRANSMISSION ISSUES AND THEY ARE REFUSING TO HELP ME.",

AFTER THE 1,000 MILES, IT WENT BACK TO THE SHAKING, VIBRATING & HESITATING.    2ND TIME BRINGING IT IN, I HAD THE MANAGER OF THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT RIDE WITH ME & HE FELT THE SHAKING, SO, AGAIN, THEY RESET THE SYSTEM AGAIN, GAVE ME THE INFO ABOUT WAITING 1,000 MILES TO RESET.  AFTER THE 1,000 MILES, IT AGAIN, BEGAN SHAKING, VIBRATING & HESITATING AT LOW SPEEDS.    THE SERVICE MANAGER GAVE ME HIS CARD & SAID IF I HAD ANY PROBLEMS, GIVE HIM A CALL.    3RD TIME BRINGING IT IN, THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAD A MECHANIC RIDE WITH ME.

IT SHOULDN'T MATTER IF I'M A GOOD OR BAD DRIVER, THE CAR SHOULD RUN PROPERLY.      AND NOW (3/21/16), I HAVE FELT THE WORST SHAKING, VIBRATING & HESITATION EVER.  I FELT INCREDIBLY UNSAFE TODAY.

I HAD ALREADY BEEN IN FOR DIAGNOSTIC CHECKS AND REPROGRAMMING SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE YEARS I OWNED THE CAR. THEN THEY HAD TO REPLACE THE CLUTCH AND TCM; KEPT MY CAR FOR 3-4 DAYS. SO AFTER ALL THAT WAS FIXED I TRADED AND GOT A 2014 FORD FOCUS HATCHBACK. ALL THAT STUFF WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BEHIND ME AND NO GLITCHES IN THIS YEAR. AFTER 15,000 MILES WAS PUT ON THE CAR THE CLUTCH STARTED ACTING UP AGAIN AND PROGRESSIVELY GOT WORSE. THE SHUTTERING AND STUTTERING BECOME SO BAD I THOUGHT MY CAR WAS GOING TO FALL APART. FROM A DEAD STOP TO A GO (20-30 MPH) IT HAD SUCH A HARD TIME SHIFTING GEARS THAT THE RPM'S WOULD JUST TAKE OFF. GRINDING NOISES UNDER THE CAR UPON ACCELERATION. WHEN IN CRUISE CONTROL IT WOULD JUST LOSE SPEED ON IT'S OWN, CRUISE SET FOR 60MPH AND RPM\"S WOULD JUST DROP OUTTA NO WHERE LIKE THE CAR WAS ABOUT TO STALL. TOOK IT IN AND SURE ENOUGH NEW CLUTCH AND SEALS WERE ALREADY NEEDED (THIS CAR WAS PURCHASED IN APRIL 2015 AND THE CLUTCH WENT OUT IN JANUARY 2016). THEY KEPT THE CAR A WK (AT NO TIME WAS I OFFERED A RENTAL) HAD TO BORROW MY PARENTS VEHICLES TO GET AROUND; MY HUSBAND NEEDED HIS CAR. HAD THE CAR BACK A WK AND HAVE ALREADY TAKEN IT IN TO BE REPROGRAMMED B/C YET AGAIN WE ARE HAVING SHUTTERING AND STUTTERING ISSUES AS WELL AS PROBLEMS UPON ACCELERATION. WHEN I CHECK 2014 FOCUS RECALLS THERE ARE SOME MAJOR RECALLS. I WAS ISSUED A RECALL ON MY VIN# FOR THE TCM ALREADY. THEY HAVE INCREASED MY WARRANTY TO 100,000 B/C THEY KNOW I WILL BE BACK FOR MORE REPAIRS AND THE SERVICE GUY STATED REPLACING THE CLUTCH IS ONLY TEMPORARY, I WILL BE BACK FOR A NEW ONE AGAIN AND AGAIN.",

AROUND 7,000 MILES WHILE THE CAR APPEARED TO BE RUNNING OKAY A SERVICE TRANSMISSION LIGHT CAME ON  WITH A RED TRIANGLE. I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OFF INTO A PARKING LOT. I TURNED THE CAR OFF TO SEE IF THE MESSAGE WOULD STILL APPEAR. IT DIDN'T BUT ALTHOUGH THE GEAR SHIFT WENT INTO REVERSE THE CAR WOULDN'T MOVE BACKWARD EVEN AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS. AFTER THE TOW TRUCK ARRIVED IT DID BACK UP  BUT I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE IT THE 55 MILES TO MY HOME. TOW TRUCK DRIVER COULD SEE THAT THERE WERE WARNING MESSAGES BUT COULDN'T GET THE COMPUTER TO SHOW THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE WARNINGS. AFTER IT WAS TOWED HOME I TESTED IT AGAIN & IT WENT BACKWARDS OKAY. I DID TAKE IT TO THE DEALER WHO ADMITTED THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM & SUPPOSEDLY FIXED IT. THEN WHILE GOING FROM STORE TO STORE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING THE CAR STARTED TO SHUDDER, PRETTY VIOLENTLY NOW, UPON ACCELERATION FROM DEAD STOPS AT ALMOST EVERY RED LIGHT. I THOUGHT THE CAR WASN'T GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH A FEW INTERSECTIONS ESPECIALLY ON HILLS. SINCE THEN THE CAR HAS ONLY SHUDDERED ONCE. SO BECAUSE IT'S SO INTERMITTENT IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER WHILE THIS IS HAPPENING.

ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, THE VEHICLE ACCELERATED ON ITS OWN AND APPLYING THE BRAKE DID NOT SLOW THE VEHICLE DOWN.  LAST YEAR, THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY ACCELERATED AND THE CONSUMER HAD TO HIT A CURB, IN ORDER TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE.  THE CONSUMER STATED THE VEHICLE HAD NUMEROUS TRANSMISSION AND ENGINE LEAKS WHERE SEALS HAD TO BE REPLACED. FIVE DAYS AFTER THE VEHICLE WAS INSPECTED, THE VEHICLE WENT INTO PARK WHILE IN THE MIDST OF DRIVING 65 MPH/ THE VEHICLE SHOOK, AND REVVED AND THE  RP'S WERE EXTREMELY HIGH, THEN THE VEHICLE STARTED TO SLOW DOWN WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE FROM THE CONSUMER. THE VEHICLE CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP, AN ERROR MESSAGE APPEARED THAT SAID TRANSMISSION NOT IN PARK. *JB",

ONE WEEK AFTER GETTING CAR HOME IT BEGAN SHUDDERING AND FAILING TO ACCELERATE ONLY TO RAPIDLY SHIFT GEARS ONCE IT FIGURED OUT WHAT IT WANTED TO DO.  WHEN TRYING TO ENTER HIGHWAY THE CAR WOULD RUN THROUGH 4 GEARS BEFORE HITTING MPH CAUSING HORRIBLE AND SLUGGISH PERFORMANCE.

I CALLED UP DEALER AND DEMANDED THEY REPAIR.  DEALER RESET TRANSMISSION TO FACTORY DEFAULTS WHICH FIXED NOTHING.  TOOK CAR IN 3 MORE TIMES WHEN FINALLY THEY ADMITTED IT WAS A CLUTCH ISSUE AND PUT ME ON A BACK ORDER LIST.  I WAITING 3 MONTHS WHILE HAVING TO DRIVE AN UNSAFE VEHICLE BUT IT FINALLY WAS REPLACED.  TO NO ONES SURPRISE THE CAR PERFORMS WORSE NOW THEN IT DID.  TOOK BACK TO DEALER 2 MORE TIMES, TO WHICH I WAS TOLD THE CLUTCH HAS A 1000 MILE BREAK IN PERIOD.

I DRIVE MY CAR BETWEEN ROCHESTER, NY AND BUFFALO, NY OFTEN AND THIS IS QUITE CONCERNING TO ME. I TOOK IT INTO THE FORD SERVICE DEPARTMENT SINCE I AM UNDER WARRANTY AND I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY PART THAT IS MALFUNCTIONING. THE PART IS ON NATIONAL BACKORDER, BUT SHOULD BE IN A COUPLE DAYS AND I SHOULD BE FINE TO DRIVE MY CAR AS IT IS NOW. WELL I LOOKED UP THE ISSUE AND THERE IS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT BECAUSE OF THIS TRANSMISSION DEFECT. I DON'T FEEL SAFE AT ALL KNOWING I AM DRIVING WITH A FAULTY TRANSMISSION, IF I GET IN AN ACCIDENT I AM AT FAULT!",

I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER WHO AFTER  A DAY OF TESTING TOLD ME NOTHING WAS WRONG. THEY WERE NEVER ABLE TO RE-CREATE THE PROBLEM BUT IT ALWAYS CAME AND WENT OVER TIME. I EVENTUALLY TRADED IT BACK IN FOR THE AUTOMATIC EARLY 2014. THE CAR DROVE LIKE A DREAM UNTIL 600 MILES THE CAR WAS IN DRIVE WHILE GOING 45MPH AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT ACTED LIKE IT WAS IN NEUTRAL. THE MOTOR WOULD JUST REV BUT THERE WAS NO POWER TO THE WHEELS. I PULLED OFF THE ROAD AND SELECTED PARK, DRIVE AND REVERSE BUT THEY ALL ACTED AS NEUTRAL.... THE DEALER CAME AND PICKED THE VEHICLE UP AND DID SOME SORT OF RESET ON IT IN THE PARKING LOT. THE CAR THEN DROVE BUT THEY STILL TOOK IT WITH THEM TO THE DEALER. THE NEXT DAY THEY TOLD ME THEY DROVE AND TESTED THE VEHICLE ON A MACHINE AND ALL THE PARAMETERS WERE FINE....I TOLD THEM \"YOU RESET MY CAR BEFORE TESTING SO OFCOURSE ITS ACTING FINE NOW.\" I TOLD THEM I DID NOT WANT THE CAR BACK AND NOR DID I WANT ANOTHER FORD FOCUS. MIND YOU I HAD TO CARRY NEGATIVE EQUITY FROM THE FIRST ONE TO THIS ONE. THE DEALER AGREED TO BUY THE VEHICLE BACK AT ITS REDUCED STICKER PRICE ONLY WHICH LEFT ME WITH A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF NEGATIVE EQUITY YET AGAIN WHICH THE ONLY VEHICLE ON THE LOT THAT COULD HOLE IT WAS OF COURSE....A FORD FOCUS...I AM NOW IN MY 3RD 2014 FOCUS SE AND IT HESITATES AND JERKS FROM TIME TO TIME AND ONCE THE TRANSMISSION FAULT LIGHT CAME ON BUT DISAPPEARED AFTER I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND THEN BACK ON...THIS CAR IS UNSAFE AND HAS CAUSED A BURDEN ON ME FINANCIALLY. I AM AN ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY MEMBER AND ALL I WANTED WAS A SAFE CAR TO GET ME TO WORK. I PLEADED FOR THEM TO JUST TAKE THE CAR BACK AND SETTLE THE NEGATIVE EQUITY THEY CREATED...FORD DID NOT CARE.  *TR",

I EXPLAINED THAT WHAT I WAS NOTICING (GRINDING, LURCHING AND HITTING THE GAS AND THE CAR NOT GOING) WAS NOT NORMAL AND WAS ADVISED THAT THEY WOULD \"LOOK\" AT THE TRANSMISSION BUT WITH THEM RESETTING IT, THERE WAS PROBABLY NOTHING THEY CAN DO.    AFTER A DAY AND A HALF OF MISDIAGNOSIS OF WHAT WAS WRONG WITH MY CAR, I WAS ADVISED THAT MY HEATING CORE WAS LEAKING AND TOLD THAT MY TRANSMISSION WAS FINE (NO LEAKS). I SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AND INSISTED THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE TRANSMISSION. HE AGREED TO TEST DRIVE IT AND CALLED AWHILE LATER AND SAID THAT THEY HAD HOOKED IT UP TO A MACHINE TO TEST THE VIBRATIONS IN THE ENGINE AND THAT MY FOCUS ENGINE VIBRATIONS FAR EXCEEDED THE NORMAL AND THEY WOULD BE APPROVED BY FORD TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION.

WHEN THEY TOOK APART THE OLD CLUTCH, THEY FOUND SHARDS OF CLUTCH IN THE BELL-HOUSING AND METALLIC FLAKES.     SO FOR NOTHING BEING WRONG, SHARDS OF CLUTCH SOUND SERIOUS TO ME!! MY CAR IS ONLY 7 MONTHS OLD (ONE ROAD TRIP TO NORTH CAROLINA) AND IT HAS LOST VALUE AND I WORRY ABOUT FUTURE CLUTCH ISSUES. THE 2014 FORD FOCUS STILL ONLY HAS A STANDARD WARRANTY ON THE TRANSMISSION/CLUTCH.   *TR",

IN AUGUST HE WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT WHEN HE BACKED INTO A PARKED CAR.  THE EVENT COST ME $525.  HE SHIFTED FROM REVERSE TO DRIVE AND PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR BUT HIS CAR KEPT ROLLING BACK UNTIL IT STRUCK A CAR.  LAST WEEK WAS THE FIRST TIME MY WIFE OR I DROVE HIS CAR.   WHEN SHE RETURNED SHE SAID THAT SHE WOULD NEVER DRIVE THE CAR AGAIN.  SHE REPORTED THE SAME TRANSMISSION AND SHIFTING PROBLEMS MY SON HAD MENTIONED.  WHEN I DROVE IT TO THE DEALER I PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE AND BACKED OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY.  AFTER I WAS IN THE STREET AND TOTALLY STOPPED I PUT THE CAR IN FORWARD AND PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR.  NOTHING HAPPENED.  I CHECKED THE GEAR INDICATOR AND PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR AGAIN.  NOTHING HAPPENED.  AFTER SITTING IIN THE THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET FOR SEVERAL SECONDS THE CAR FINALLY MOVED.  IT WAS VERY SLUGGISH AND WITHIN THE FIRST 100FT. IT SHIFTED AT LEAST 3 TIMES.  PERFORMANCE LIKE THIS CONTINUED EVERY TIME I STARTED FROM A DEAD STOP. I SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE REP ABOUT WHAT I HAD JUST EXPERIENCED.  HE SAID THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS DOING EXACTLY WHAT FORD SAYS IT WAS DESIGNED IT TO DO.  HE SAID HE HAD PERSONALLY SCHEDULED OVER 20 2014 FOCUS CARS INTO THE SHOP TO CHECK THE TRANSMISSION BECAUSE OF THE SAME COMPLAINTS.  HE SAID FORD HAS A SET OF TESTS AND IF THE CAR PASSED THOSE TESTS THEY WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING.  HE SAID EVERY 2014 FOCUS HE AND THE OTHER 7-8 REPS HAD SCHEDULED FOR THE TESTS HAD, BY FORD'S INSTRUCTIONS, PASSED THE TESTS.  I  SINCERELY REQUEST THAT YOU FORCE FORD TO DO A RECALL ON THESE CARS.  NOTING THE LARGE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THE CARS OBVIOUSLY HAVE VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUES, ESPECIALLY THEIR FAILURE TO SHIFT WHEN THE DRIVER TAKES THE ACTION TO MAKE THEM SHIFT.  *TR",

THE RUMBLING, THOUGH FELT THROUGH THE CHASSIS, WAS LATER REPORTED TO BE AN IMPROPERLY ASSEMBLED AIR INTAKE? THIS MADE NO SENSE TO ME. I BELIEVE IT WAS THE ENGINE BEING HEAVY LOADED BECAUSE THE FOCUS WOULD NOT DOWNSHIFT. I RETURNED THE CAR TO GERMAIN FORD WHERE THEY KEPT IT FOR ONE DAY AND REPORTED THERE WERE NO FURTHER ISSUES WITH THE CAR. AFTER THIS TWO WEEK REPAIR I WAS PRESENTED WITH A DOCUMENT EXPLAINING THE OPERATION OF THE TRANSMISSION FOR THE FOCUS, NOT BEFORE. THE DOCUMENT DOES NOT MENTION THE BANGING INTO A LOWER GEAR WHILE PULLING AWAY FROM A STOP.

I USED THE EMERGENCY FLASHER TO WARN TWO LARGE TRUCKS COME AT ME ON THE SINGLE LAND BEHIND ME.    WHEN I DROPPED THE CAR OFF THE AFTERNOON OF JUNE 18, I REPORTED THE STALLING OUT TO THE OFFICE PERSON [XXX] AT AVIS ON FEDERAL HIGHWAY, STUART  SHE TOLD ME THE FOCUS HAS A HABIT OF SPUTTERING AND BUCKING AND ASKED IF I KNEW ABOUT THAT.   I SAID I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE CONDITION BUT THAT THIS CAR STALLED OUT.   I SAID THIS WAS VERY DANGEROUS ON A DARK ROAD. I HAD TWO INCIDENTS THAT NIGHT WITH LARGE SEMI?S COMING AT ME STALLED AS THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN.     SHE SAID SHE WOULD WRITE UP THIS CONCERN IN COMMENTS TO AVIS.    IN MY VIEW, A CAR THAT CAN STALL OUT IS SIMILAR TO THE GM CARS THAT STOPPED WITH A DEFECTIVE KEY.  THIRTEEN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THOSE GM STALL OUTS.    I WILL SENT THIS SAFETY CONCERN TO AVIS MANAGEMENT, THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRANSPORTATION ASSOCIATION  AND TO FORD, WHICH SO FAR HAS NOT HAD ANY KEY RECALLS.   IF THE FOCUS STALLS OUT OR MISFIRES, THIS SEEMS LIKE A SIMILAR SAFETY ISSUE. FORD SHOULD REMEDY THE FOCUS STALL OUT AND AVIS MAY NOT TO CONSIDER LETTING THE FOCUS OUT AS A RENTAL.

THIS IS DONE THROUGH TWO WAYS:  1) THE ABS MODULE CONTINUOUSLY MONITORS AND COMPARES THE ROTATIONAL SPEED OF THE DRIVE WHEELS IN RELATION TO THE NON-DRIVEN WHEELS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE ABS MODULE CALCULATES HOW MUCH ENGINE TORQUE REDUCTION IS REQUIRED TO ELIMINATE THE WHEEL SLIP.  IN SNOWY (+2-3?), ICY OR SLIPPERY SURFACES WHERE BOTH FRONT TIRES ARE EQUALLY IN THE SAME CONDITION, THE ABS MODULE MODULATES BRAKE PRESSURE TO BOTH BRAKE CALIPER (S) TO STOP ANY WHEEL SPIN.  2) AT THE SAME TIME, THE ABS MODULE SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE PCM TO REDUCE THE ENGINE TORQUE TO THE REQUESTED LEVEL. WITH BOTH BRAKES BEING APPLIED AND ENGINE TORQUE REDUCED TO A NEAR ?IDLE? STATE WITH THE ACCELERATOR AT ?FULL THROTTLE?, THE CAR IMMEDIATELY BECOMES STUCK.   BECAUSE THE FORD FOCUS S DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DISABLE THE TRACTION CONTROL, MY WIFE AND KIDS HAVE CONTINUOUSLY BEEN STRANDED IN A CAR THAT WILL APPLY THE BRAKES AND REDUCE THE ENGINE RPM?S RESULTING IN A CAR THAT WILL NOT MOVE IN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS.  AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE CAR HAS BEEN REQUIRED TO BE TOWED MANY TIMES IN BELOW ZERO CONDITIONS BECAUSE WE ARE UNABLE TO DISABLE THE TRACTION CONTROL.

AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS, THE DOOR FINALLY APPEARED TO LATCH AND THE INSTRUMENT PANEL DID NOT SHOW AN 'OPEN DOOR' WARNING.

WHILE DRIVING, I HAD TO DRIVE THE REMAINING DISTANCE LEANING OVER THE PASSENGER SEAT AND HOLDING THE INTERIOR PASSENGER DOOR HANDLE TO PREVENT THE DOOR FROM OPENING AGAIN BEFORE I ARRIVED AT THE DEALERSHIP.  THE DEALERSHIP INSPECTED AND LUBRICATED THE LOCKS AND LATCHES, BUT FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE DOOR.
