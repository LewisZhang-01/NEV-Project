I almost crashed going 60 mph on a 4 lane highway. It then did another large jolt and revved high into the red line. I took it to Firestone and they recommended that I take it to the dealership to check the transmission. I called the dealership and they advised me to drive it over. They told me it was \"probably the transmission as Explorers are notarious for transmission issues.\" The dealership inspected the Explorer and confirmed that it was a known transmission issue involving codes P0798 and P098. The dealership advised that there were MULTIPLE pressure code errors [that never did a warning] and that the transmission required replacement. I asked if it was covered under warranty and the dealership advised me that Ford had no issued a recall yet, even though it was a known and serious transmission issue. The dealership recommended that I call Ford Customer Care at 1-800-392-3673 and request that Ford cover the replacement. I called Ford Customer Care and spoke with Bruno who advised me that it was indeed a known issue and that I \"was not the only one with this issue\" and that \"there will be a recall soon so [I] can get reimbursed.\" Bruno was to have a supervisor call me within 24 hours. It has been almost 2 weeks and there has been no response from Ford. This is a well known issue that Ford knows of. There has been recalls of other Explorers for the same problem but my VIN is not included for some reason. If you go online, there are thousands of complaints. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE SOMEONE DIES OR IS SERIOUSLY INJURED. I have the telephone recordings of Ford but I am unable to upload them here.",

SAME SYMPTOMS, TOWED TO A DIFFERENT DEALERSHIP, THE MIKE CASTRUCCI FORD IN MILFORD, OHIO. THIS TIME IT'S THE OTHER FRONT WHEEL BEARING. TALKED TO FORD CUSTOMER CARE REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE AGAIN, AT FIRST HE TRIED TO IMPLY THAT IT'S THE WAY WE DRIVE THE CAR (EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE KEPT OTHER CARS FOR 10 YEARS AND LONGER AND NEVER HAD THIS ISSUE), THEN TRIED TO IMPLY THAT WE GO OFF-ROADING (ALSO NOT TRUE, JUST NORMAL HIGHWAY AND CITY ROADS) AND THEN HE TOLD ME THE ONLY WAY A RECALL WILL BE ISSUED IS IF THE GOVERNMENT FEELS THERE IS A SAFETY ISSUE. SO THIS TELLS ME THAT THEY ARE A) AWARE THAT IT'S AN ISSUE WITH THE WAY A FORD EXPLORER IS CONSTRUCTED AND B) NOT GOING TO RECALL THIS CAR OR PART UNTIL ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE INJURED OR KILLED.

THIS ACCELERATION WHEN BRAKING IN A SUDDEN STOP HAS HAPPENED TO BOTH MY WIFE AND I NUMEROUSE TIMES IN 36,000 MILES AND I HAVE CHECKED THE BRAKES MORE THAN ONCE FINDING NO PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES. I LEARNED  FROM A BODY SHOP EMPLOYEE AT SAM PACK WHO RELATED THAT HE HAD HEARD THIS SAME COMPLAINT BEFORE INCLUDINING FROM A FAMILY MEMBER. I BELIEVE THAT WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING IS THAT DRIVERS WITH THIS FEATURE STEP ON BOTH THE GAS PEDAL AND THE BRAKE .
