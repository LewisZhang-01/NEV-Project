I ALSO REMEMBERED THIS HAPPENING TO THE 1991 PLYMOUTH GRAND VOYAGER THAT I USED TO OWN. THESE VEHICLES WERE PURCHASED USED AND THEREFORE, I SUSPECT THAT AT ONE TIME SOMEONE HAS RAN THESE WITHOUT A FILTER IN PLACE. THE BIG QUESTION IS,  OF ALL THESE VANS ON THE ROAD, HOW MANY HAVE BEEN RUN WITHOUT A FILTER. I HAD OWNED EACH OF THESE AT LEAST SIX MONTHS BEFORE THIS HAPPENED.
