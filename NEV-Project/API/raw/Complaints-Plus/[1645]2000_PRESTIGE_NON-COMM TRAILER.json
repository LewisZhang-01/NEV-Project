        "summary": "THE STEEL FRAME ON BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT SIDE DIRECTLY BEHIND THE WHEEL AXLE OF A BOAT TRAILER WHICH CARRIES AN 18 FT MARIAH PLEASURE BOAT.  THE RIGHT SIDE WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY BROKEN IN HALF AND THE LEFT SIDE IS FRACTURED ON THE OUTSIDE FRAME.  THE PROBLEM IS A DESIGN FLAW WHICH INVOLVES THE STEEL FRAME BEING CUT OUT TO ALLOW THE TRAILER BRAKE LINE TO BE HIDDEN INSIDE THE TRAILER FRAME AND THE BOTTOM CUT OUT TO ALLOW THE BRAKE LINE TO COME OUT OF THE FRAME AND CONNECT TO THE BRAKES AT THE WHEELS.  OVER- TIME THE FRAME WEAKENS FROM RUST AND NOT BEING A CLEAN CUT AND SINCE THE FRAME IS NOT REINFORCED ON THE OUTSIDE, EVENTUALLY IT BRAKES.  THE FRACTURE IS HIDDEN BEHIND THE TRAILER WHEEL.  HAD I NOT REMOVED THE TIRE TO REPLACE THE WOOD SKID BEHIND THE WHEEL I WOULD NEVER HAD FOUND THIS AND COULD HAVE CAUSED MY FAMILY, OF SIX, TO HAVE CRASHED POSSIBLY ON A CROWDED HIGHWAY.  THE FIX COSTED ME $400.00 TO HAVE STEEL PLATES WELDED ON BOTH THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE FRAME AT BOTH WHEELS BY A PROFESSIONAL WELDER.  *TR",
