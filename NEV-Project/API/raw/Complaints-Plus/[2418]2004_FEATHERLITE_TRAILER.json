THE TRAILER HAD COMPASS TIRES,MADE BY HANGZHOU ZHONGEE RUBBER CO., WHICH I DISCOVERED HAS A RECALL. I CONTACTED THE FIRM REPRESENTING THE FACTORY . AFTER FILLING OUT THE REQUIRED FORMS , INFORMATION , PICTURES, AND DOT CODES THEY SAID THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT. I ASKED FOR A VOUCHER TO REPLACE THE TIRES AT THERE DEALER. I HAVE SENCE RECEIVED A CHECK FOR $218.40. THAT AMOUNT WILL ONLY REPLACE ONE TIRE. THE QUESTION IS, DO I HAVE ANY RECOURSE IN GETTING THE OTHER THREE TIRES REPLACED? *TR",
