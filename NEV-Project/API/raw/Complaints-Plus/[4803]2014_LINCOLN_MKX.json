        "summary": "In 2021 had an issue with brakes failing and becoming unresponsive/difficult to press almost causing a crash. Vehicle was inspected and the dealer replaced the brake booster and a vaccum line. This didn\u2019t fix the issue. Recently had the same problem occur again where the brakes are intermittent and sometimes become soft and sink to the floor while driving. Apparently a bunch of people have been having this issue and the fix for it is to put your vehicle into reverse going 20mph and to slam on the brakes several times until the brakes become firm. Apparently there must be an issue with the ABS/HCU having a valve stick. Have seen Ford and Lincoln recall older cars up to 2010 in the past few years for DOT 3 causing corrosion to cause valve in HCU to stick. Remedy had dealer flush DOT 3 brake fluid and put DOT 4 and change HCU and master cylinder cap to say DOT 4 fluid. No recalls for my 2014 but I believe this is definitely a safety issue that should be addressed.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EqIkUE46Kvk",

THE CONSUMER STATED HE SHOOK THE GEAR SHIFT A LITTLE AND THE LIGHT WENT OUT. A FEW DAYS LATER, BEFORE HE COULD RAISE THE HATCH, THE VEHICLE STARTED ROLLING BACKWARDS INTO THE STREET.  THE CONSUMER MANAGED TO GET IN THE VEHICLE, AND ONCE AGAIN A LIGHT WAS ON, INDICATING THE VEHICLE WAS NOT IN PARK, DESPITE HIM PLACING THE VEHICLE IN PARK.  ALSO, THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR WOULD SPORADICALLY GO ALL THE WAY UP WHILE DRIVING,  WHICH MADE THE ENTIRE RIGHT SIDE OF THE VEHICLE A BLIND SPOT.  AFTER A YEAR AND A HALF OF COMPLAINTS, THE DEALER INSPECTED THE MIRROR AND DETERMINED IT WAS DEFECTIVE AND REPLACED IT. THE REAR HATCH WOULD SPORADICALLY OPEN, AND RISE WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED OR BEING DRIVEN. THE CONSUMER STATED INTERMITTENTLY, A LIGHT WOULD ILLUMINATE ON THE VEHICLE, SAYING A KEY WAS NOT DETECTED EXHAUST FUMES ENTERED THE VEHICLE WHILE DRIVING AT TIMES. *JB  *JS",

IN ADDITION TO THE SERVICE TRACT FAILURE (INDICATOR LIGHT SHOWING 2 CARS), NOW HAVE MULTIPLE PROBLEMS.  PROBLEMS CONSIST OF:  CROSS SERVICE SYSTEM FAULT, VEHICLES ROLLS FORWARD & BACKWARD AFTER STOPPING, AND A BIG CLUNK WHEN PUTTING IN A GEAR.  SPOKE WITH THE (A) GM OF THE DEALERSHIP AND INFORMED HIM VEHICLE WAS IN FOR THE SERVICE TRACT FAILURE ON 2/8/2016 AND NOW I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AND ADDITIONAL PROBLEM.  I WAS ON A CITY STREET WHEN THE ADVANCE SERVICE TRACT IMMEDIATELY LIT UP WITH 2 INDICATORS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE STEERING WHEEL.  ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN AND THE CROSS SERVICE SYSTEM FAULT LIGHT APPEARED WITH A TOOL LIKE OBJECT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE STEERING WHEEL.  WHILE ATTEMPTING TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN, THE CAR DID NOT WANT TO GO FORWARD, BARELY MOVING AND A TINY HILL TO PULL WAS IMPOSSIBLE.  I IMMEDIATELY START DETOURING AWAY FROM MAJOR CITY STREET BECAUSE I HAD NOT IDEA WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND I NEEDED TO GET HOME WITH A SENIOR CITIZEN OVER 80 WITH ME.  THE SUV HAD DIFFICULTY MOVING FORWARD.     FOR A 2014 LINCOLN MKX, I WAS INFORMED THAT I HAD A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM AND APPARENTLY A CALL WAS MADE TO THE HOT LINE TO FIX THE ADVANCE SERVICE TRACT AND THE CROSS SERVICE SYSTEM FAULT.    MY CONCERN, IS THE 2014 MKX A LINCOLN LEMON?  RECEIVED SUV BACK ON 3/18/2016",
