        "summary": "Went to start my 2014 Explorer on and it struggled 3 times before turning on. It showed a \"Check Brake System\" light in the dashboard for a quick second but other than that the car seemed to be ok. I turned on my information panel to check the temperature gauge and it was normal. Kept it on that while driving my kids to school to make sure if I had to pull over I could. I immediately brought it to Hemborg Ford in Norco, CA. When I first brought it in and they popped my hood my coolant tank was below the recommended line and the service advisor immediately said it's most likely my water pump. They had my SUV for over 24 hours for testing and sure enough it's the water pump. Ford decided to install the water pumps INSIDE the engine rather than outside. This is a very dangerous move as the coolant and oil can mix which can cause a vehicle to shut down unexpectedly. Thankfully I trusted my intuition and took it in when I noticed something off and didn't ruin my engine or overall car. I was quoted $2900 to fix this issue. $2500 in LABOR and $400 in PARTS. This is because the job can take up to 14 hours to complete start to finish due to the location of the pump. This is ridiculous.   We need something done. Soooooo many people are paying thousands of money out of pocket for something that shouldn't even be a problem.

The two problems I am having seem to have been programmed into the onboard computer to fail after a certain time or mileage.  I will address each problem individually starting with the most hazardous one first.  The onboard navigation system utilizes a SD card program that becomes outdated as time passes.  I have received numerous mailing from Ford notifying me that the original navigation system is outdated and that I should update to a current one at a cost to me of $149.00.  The original system works fine for me and I felt no need to upgrade until the system began getting interrupted by prompts to update (see FIGURE 1 below).  When the prompt appears the navigation system is no longer operational.  The most recent of these interruptions became a serious and hazardous situation.  I was driving on the interstate nearing an interchange to switch to a different highway.  I was relying on the navigation system to direct me to the correct exit and this is when the prompt appeared.  The navigation system was now useless and will only resume normal operation if the vehicle is shut off and restarted.  You don\u2019t do this at 70+ mph!  My only option was to use my phone which meant I had to program it and while driving this is dangerous.  I feel Ford was being irresponsible by programming the prompts into the onboard computer that disable the navigation system in return for the sale of an updated SD card.  Ford was profit motivated in this programmed failure.   FIGURE 1       IMG_1978.JPG     75.5kB   INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",

Which I did and unfortunately, they aren't willing to assist in the major problems with the vehicle. I was told on Monday November 29, 2021 they will be willing to repair heat temperature and that's it.    The problems with the truck is the radio touch screen which controls heat, music, seat warmers and so forth isn\u2019t working, temperature on right passenger side, back up camera, carbon monoxide coming thru vents, manifold, and the transfer case needs to be replaced because its about to go; if it hasn't gone already. The truck wont back up without making loud grinding noises and stalling.  These problems my family are having substantially impairs the use and valve of my vehicle and creates a serious safety hazard to my family. After explaining to the dealer that I am on a fixed income of just SSI and needed my vehicle for appointments and everything; they isn't willing to repair the major safety. It's very hard to understand why anyone would sell my family a 2014 Ford Explorer knowingly aware of its history from November 16, 2018 from a previous owner of Carbon Monoxide concerns, still this vehicle was sold to my family.

I am very surprised that my vehicle is not covered by any of the safety recalls. The failed rack and pinion was sent back to Ford for analysis. It is a sealed unit so the Ford mechanics at Capitol Ford in Sante Fe were unable to comment.I have attached a photo of the part. For reference with the cost of towing, repairs, car rental and flights, my outlay has been approximately $4,500. I have the necessary documentation to support this figure.",

The wheel is sticking while driving on the highway and I have to force it to move at times. It does not return freely anymore on it's own to a straight forward position. After having the vehicle inspected atva local suspension shop, they told me it's dangerious and I could loose my steering entirely while driving and to have the rack and pinion replaced. I can see this is a common problem with this model and there was a similiar recall a few years prior for a similar problem. I don't think the proper improvements to the rack and pinion where ever applied in later models and there should be another recall or the prior recall should be extended. Thank you.",

This is the second recall to resolve an outstanding issue with my cars rear toe link 20S62/20V675. On three separate occasions I have attempted to get this remediated with three dealerships turning away servicing my vehicle due to lack of parts. I filed a complaint with the Ford Corporate office to report what I would consider Unfair Trade Practice and consumer right violations as these dealerships seem to be able to conduct the work however are turning away the recalls either to prioritize paying jobs. This leaves myself as a consumer with a lingering risk, exponential exposure to harm when operating my vehicle. Ford company is willfully aware of the situation and have not addressed this matter. I submitted another escalation today due to being turned away for a 3rd time. Keep in mind that I have requested to be contacted when parts have been available or if the parts can be ordered and neither of these requests have been met. I am aware that we are coming off the heels of the Covid pandemic and these dealerships might be short staffed, so they are being directed to avoid recall resolution.",

The vehicle was nearly impossible to steer.  It took all my strength to even move the wheel slightly to be able to pull back into the driveway and off the road.  I researched this online and found there are 100's of other people that have had the same issue, yet ford refuses to do anything.  They have issues recalls for 2011-2013 and 2015-2017 explorers for the same issue but not 2014.  We did the diagnostics and had to order a new rack and pinion however the part is not in stock and on backorder because so many people are having this issue.  This should be an obvious sign to Ford that something is wrong.   I am including links to other sites showing other people have had the same issue.  I know others have also filed a report with you.  I tried talking to ford and opened a case with them but they aren't taking any responsibility. The only thing I am thankful for is that unlike some of the others who weren't so lucky, I wasn't on a major highway or going 60+mph when the steering went out.  This is a huge safety concern and it is unfortunate that it appears it will take someone losing their life before Ford decides to admit their at fault.

        "summary": "ON NOVEMBER 8, 2020 I WAS  PULLING OUT OF MY DRIVE WAY TO LEAVE MY HOUSE AND NOTICED A GRINDING SOUND COMING FROM THE FRONT END, IT WAS VERY LOUD, AND CAUSED ME TO HAVE  LOSS OF CONTROL OVER THE CARS STEERING; ESPECIALLY  WHEN TURNING WHEEL LEFT AND RIGHT AT LOWER SPEEDS AND ON SHARP TURNS. (THE WHEELS DO NOT STRAIGHTEN OUT OR RETURN TO CENTER WHEN EXITING A TURN AND WILL THEN OVER COMPENSATE AND VEER TO THE RIGHT AFTER HAVING TO MANUALLY TURN THE WHEEL BACK.) WE TOOK IT TO A LOCAL FORD DEALER.  AFTER REVIEWING MY EXPLORER THEY STATED THAT THE RACK AND PINION WAS BAD AND IT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED ASAP DUE TO THIS BEING A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AND WE SHOULDN'T WAIT TO GET IT REPLACED TOTAL COST FOR THE JOB WOULD BE $4,284.59. I CALLED  FORD COOPERATE AND EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT THIS WAS A SAFETY ISSUE AS IT CAME ON SUDDENLY WITH OUT WARNING. I WAS MADE AWARE THAT THE PREVIOUS YEARS 2011-2013 HAVE BEEN RECALLED FOR THIS SAME ISSUE, AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THE 2014 AND 2015 HAVING THE SAME ISSUE BUT WITH ONLY A \"WARNING\" BEING PLACED ON THEM, NOT A RECALL FOR THE 2014 OR 2015.  THEY TOLD ME THAT MY YEAR DOESN'T HAVE A RECALL AND STATED I COULD OPEN A CASE AND FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE NHTSA AND THAT WAS ALL I COULD DO, BUT IF A RECALL WAS OFFERED IN THE FUTURE I COULD POSSIBLE GET REIMBURSED.  WHEN WE BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL FORD DEALER, THEY INFORMED US THAT  THERE WAS A RECALL NOTICE FOR THE TOE LINK THAT CAN AFFECT THE STEERING BUT NOT A RECALL ON THE RACK. THIS STEERING RACK ISSUE POSES A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN. PLEASE CONSIDER WORKING WITH FORD TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF ALL WHO DRIVE THE 2014 EXPLORER AND PLACE A RECALL ON THIS ITEM ASAP. I AM VERY FORTUNATE NO ONE WAS PHYSICALLY HURT WHEN MY STEERING WENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION IN THIS MATTER OF MAJOR SAFETY. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU.",

TWO WEEKS AFTER GETTING THE COOLANT FILLED, MY RADIATOR FAN BEGAN RUNNING FAST AND LOUD. I BROUGHT IT INTO THE SHOP AND WAS TOLD I HAD A LEAKING WATER PUMP. THERE WAS ONLY ONE INCH LEFT OF COOLANT IN THE RESERVOIR AFTER JUST BEING FILLED UP. I WAS THEN TOLD IT WOULD TAKE 14-16 HOURS OF LABOR TO REPLACE THE WATER PUMP WHICH ITSELF COSTS LESS THAN $150. I WAS REFERRED BY THE SHOP TO THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE THE WORK NEEDED WAS EXTENSIVE AND BECAUSE IT INVOLVED A FORD PART. THE DEALERSHIP REFUSED TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS AND REFERRED ME TO FORD. THE DEALERSHIP CONFIRMED THE WATER PUMP LEAK. BASICALLY, THE ENGINE HAD TO BE TAKEN APART TO REPLACE THE WATER PUMP, BECAUSE THE PUMP IS MADE PART OF THE ENGINE ITSELF. I BELIEVE THE FORD ENGINE AND THE WATER PUMP IS DEFECTIVE. THE GASKETS OR BEARINGS IN THE WATER PUMP FAIL AND THERE ARE WEEP HOLES IN THE WATER PUMP WHICH ALLOW COOLANT TO LEAK INTO THE ENGINE AND MIX WITH THE ENGINE OIL.

AT THIS TIME THE STEERING WAS STILL OK JUST JUST TOUCHY, SO I RESTARTED THE CAR THINKING IT WOULD RESET THE COMPONENTS THAT WAS MAYBE THROWING THE MESSAGES, THE RED WARNING WENT AWAY BUT WAS RETURENED BY THE SAME MESSAGE AS WE PULLED IN TO THE DRIVEWAY OF MY HOME BUT AT THE SUGGESTION OF THE DEALERSHIP THEY ASKED THAT I REMOVE THE BATTERY FOR 1 HOUR TO SEE IF THE COMPONENTS WOULD RESET DUE TO THAT BUT DID NOT HELP THINGS AT ALL SO I HAD TO BRING IT IN ON 4-20 WHICH THEY INFORMED ME OF THE $2K BILL TO FIX WHICH IF YOU DO RESEARCH IS A HIGHLY COMMON ISSUE WITH-IN THE F-150, EXPLORER AND FLEX LINE UPS.

CALLED FORD DEALERSHIP, MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR 2 DAYS LATER, THE EARLIEST. STARTED VEHICLE UP NEXT DAY, NOTHING CLEARED. CALLED TOW COMPANY AND TOLD THEM TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND IT CAN SIT THERE. TALKED TO SERVICE MANAGER AND SOUNDS LIKE THEY ALREADY HAD AN IDEA I WAS GOING TO BE GETTING A NEW STEERING RACK. I'M JUST GLAD I WASNT DRIVING AT HIGH SPEEDS LIKE A LOT OF THE OTHER POSTS AND HOW ARE A FEW YEARS ON RECALL WHEN IT SEEMS TO BE ALL YEARS FROM 2011 ON UP. VEHICLE IS WAITING FOR ANOTHER DAY TO GET INTO THE MECHANICS BAY EVEN THOUGH I ALREADY KNOW IT WILL BE A 1500 TO 2500 DOLLAR REPAIR. VEHICLE HAS 76K MILES. DONT GET ME STARTED ON THE KEY FOB.

STARTING BACK WHEN I FIRST PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AT APPROXIMATELY 59,000 MILES, I HAVE EXPERIENCED AN EXHAUST ODOR IN THE CABIN SHORTLY AFTER ACCELERATING OVER 3,000RPMS. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED AT MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP TWICE, WITH THE TECHNICIAN CONFIRMING THE SMELL. AFTER THIS WORK WAS PERFORMED, I STILL TO THIS DAY AM SUFFERING FROM EXHAUST FUMES AND PHYSICAL ILLNESS DIRECTLY RELATED TO MY FORD EXPLORER. ALL REPAIR ORDERS FROM INVOLVED FORD DEALERSHIPS ARE IN MY POSSESSION CONFIRMING EXHAUST FUMES ARE STILL ENTERING THE CABIN.    FROM THE TIME I TOOK OWNERSHIP IN OCTOBER 2016, I HAVE EXPERIENCED PHYSICAL ILLNESS WHEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE FOR MORE THAN 1 HOUR AT A TIME. I GET EXTREMELY LIGHTHEADED AND NAUSEATED, WHICH HAS CAUSED ME TO FREQUENTLY STOP THE VEHICLE AND VOMIT. MY PASSENGERS IN THE VEHICLE HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED SIMILAR SYMPTOMS WHEN RIDING IN THE VEHICLE. WHEN THIS HAPPENS, I STOP AT A SAFE LOCATION AND REMOVE MYSELF TO FRESH AIR, AND THE SYMPTOMS SOON PASS AND I AM ABLE TO DRIVE AGAIN.     RECENTLY, I HAVE TRAVELED FROM MASSACHUSETTS TO VERMONT IN MY EXPLORER. THE MOSTLY HIGHWAY DRIVING TRIP IT WAS ME AS WELL AS MY GIRLFRIEND. AFTER AROUND AN HOUR OF DRIVING AT 60MPH, MY GIRLFRIEND AND I WERE FEELING VERY DIZZY AND BECAME NAUSEATED, SO I OPTED TO STOP AND RELAX AT A REST STOP FOR FRESH AIR PRIOR TO CONTINUING MY TRIP TO VERMONT. I HAVE INSTALLED A CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTOR IN MY VEHICLE, WHICH HAS ACTIVATED MORE THAN ONE OCCASION WHILE DRIVING. AT THIS TIME I AM NEGOTIATING WITH FORD'S OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL TO PERFORM A BUYBACK OF MY EXPLORER AND REPLACE IT WITH A DIFFERENT VEHICLE.",

WE ENDED UP RUSHING HER TO THE HOSPITAL TO SEE WHAT HE PROBLEM WAS,  WHICH WAS THE SAME DAY THAT WE RECEIVED THE RECALL NOTICE FROM FORD ABOUT CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING THAT WAS HAPPENING IN ALL 2011-2017 FORD EXPLORER MODELS. SO WHILE SHE WAS IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM WE HAD HER BLOOD AND OXYGEN LEVELS CHECKED FOR CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING ESPECIALLY BECAUSE MY WIFE IS STILL BREASTFEEDING OUR 10 MONTHS OLD DAUGHTER. I HAVE RECENTLY TOOK MY VEHICLE TO A FORD DEALERSHIP FOR THEM TO CORRECT THIS ISSUE BUT MY REAL CONCERN IS WITH THIS ISSUE AFFECTING MILLIONS OF VEHICLES AND PEOPLE,  WHAT IS THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS HAPPENING AGAIN. WE PLAN TO FOLLOW UP WITH OUR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF CARBON MONOXIDE BEING DETECTED WITHIN ANYONE IN MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY AS WE DRIVE THE 2014 FORD EXPLORER DAILY. I'M REACHING OUT TO FIND OUT WHAT ARE SOME OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE AS FORD CONSUMERS.

THE PROBLEM IS REPEATABLE EVERY TIME:  PUT VENT SYSTEM IN RECIRCULATION MODE, SUSTAINED ACCELERATION OVER 3,000 RPM, WAIT 5 SECONDS, STRONG SULFUR ODOR COMES THROUGH DASH BOARD VENTS.  I AM NOW EXPERIENCING HEADACHES ON A CONSISTENT BASIS AS I HAVE BEEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE MORE OFTEN FOR COMMUTING SINCE PURCHASING IT IN MARCH 2017 WITH 25K MILES.  I AM SEEING A DOCTOR AND AM BUILDING A CASE FOR MORE SEVERE HEADACHES WITH INCREASED DRIVING IN MY EXPLORER.  TODAY, I DECIDED TO LOOK UNDER THE VEHICLE - I AM INCLUDING PHOTOS OF THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD WHICH SHOWS A CRACK NEAR THE PIPE-TO-FLANGE CONNECTION.  AND, NO, MY VEHICLE IS NOT A POLICE CRUISER AND IT DOES NOT HAVE AFTERMARKET PARTS INSTALLED.  HOW MANY MORE COMPLAINTS DO YOU NEED?  TSB 14-0130 IS FORD'S CHEAP ATTEMPT TO HIDE A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM AND AVOID A COSTLY RECALL OF OVER 1 MILLION VEHICLES.  THE EVIDENCE CONTINUES TO MOUNT, INJURIES HAVE OCCURRED, COUNTLESS EXPLORER OWNERS HAVE EXPENDED MUCH RESOURCES IN FILING COMPLAINTS, AND FORD SAYS, \"THESE VEHICLES ARE SAFE.  WE HAVE NOT FOUND A SAFETY ISSUE HERE\". FORD HAS ISSUED TSBS WHICH DO NOT ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. THEIR LATEST INSULT TO OFFER TO \"INSPECT AND REPAIR\" REAR LIFT GATES AND DRAIN VALVES, AND REPROGRAM THE AIR CIRCULATION SYSTEM IS LAUGHABLE, NOTHING MORE THAN A DISTRACTION TO HIDE THE REAL PROBLEM. FORD SHOULD PUT EVERY EXPLORER ON A LIFT AND INSPECT THE EXHAUST MANIFOLDS, AND DO EXTENSIVE TESTING OF THE VACUUM SYSTEM THAT IS CONNECTED TO THE AIR CIRCULATION SYSTEM.  NHTSA:  WHY IS IT TAKING YOU SO LONG TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM?  DOES SOMEONE NEED TO DIE BEFORE YOU OR FORD TAKE THIS MATTER SERIOUSLY?  YOU HAVE THE EVIDENCE YOU NEED TO FORCE A RECALL, NOW! *DT*JB",

THE FIRST WAS A PATCH JOB WHICH I FULLY EXPECTED, AS WELL AS A RETURN TRIP TO REPAIR A MONTH LATER.  NOT CONVENIENT AS IT'S AN HOUR AWAY IN LA TRAFFIC.  FIRST \"REPAIR\" TOOK OVER 3 WEEKS AND THEY CONTINUALLY WANTED ME TO RETURN THE RENTAL CAR AS IT WAS COSTING THEM---I TOLD THEM I WOULD BE GLAD TO RETURN IT AS SOON AS THE CAR WAS FIXED.  THEY TRIED THEIR BEST TO GET ME TO PAY FOR EACH REPAIR, WHICH I REFUSED AS I PURCHASED A CERTIFIED-SUPPOSEDLY SAFE-VEHICLE WHICH FORD ACKNOWLEDGED HAD A KNOWN FACTORY DEFECT.  SAME STORY WITH 2ND REPAIR WHICH TOOK 10 DAYS WHERE THEY SUPPOSEDLY REPLACED THE ENTIRE EXHAUST SYSTEM.  I HAVE MY DOUBTS THOUGH AS WE HAVE THE SAME MUFFLER AND EXHAUST PIPE WHICH I WOULD ASSUME WAS PART OF THE EXHAUST SYSTEM.  SO FAR WE DON'T SMELL ANY FUMES IN THE CABIN---WHAT'S SCARY THOUGH IS THAT CO HAS NO ODOR SO WE'RE GETTING A CO MONITOR FOR THE CABIN.",

HAD MY 45K SERVICE AND TOLD THEM ABOUT BAD ODOR SMELL IN THE CAR AT TED BRITT AND THEY SAID EVERYTHING IS IN GREAT CONDITION, 5K MILES LATER, REAR WHEELS HAS GRINDING NOISES WHEN DRIVING AT LOW OR HIGH SPEEDS AND THE BAD ODOR IS STILL AROUND, MY 8 YEAR OLD SON COMPLAINS ABOUT THE CAR GIVING HIM HEADACHES. I TOOK IT BACK TO FORD AND THEY SAID THERE IS ONLY A TSB SO, THE OWNERS DO NOT GET NOTIFIED, WHICH I THINK, WE AS OWNERS SHOULD BE NOTIFIED BY THE MANUFACTURE OF ANY HARMFUL SUBSTANCE LINGERING INSIDE THE CAR CABIN AND SHOULD BE RECALLED AND FIXED AT NOT COST TO THE OWNERS.

LUCKILY THERE WAS A NEARBY CAR WASH TO VACUUM THE DEBRIS OFF OF EVERYONE AND CALM DOWN THE SCARE THAT PUT US IN PANIC. WE DIDN'T WANT GLASS FLYING OFF AND HITTING OTHER VEHICLES AROUND US. WE TOOK PHOTOS AND INVESTIGATED THE VEHICLE FOR POSSIBLE EVIDENCE AS TO WHY OUR SUNROOF EXPLODED. TO OUR FINDINGS THERE WAS NO OTHER POSSIBLE ANSWERS OTHER THAN OUR SUNROOF CLEARLY JUST EXPLODED OUT OF NOWHERE. AND WE STILL HAD 2 HOURS TO DRIVE ON HIGHWAY TO GET HOME AT NIGHT. I'M WORRIED FOR THE SAFETY OF MY KIDS BECAUSE WE HAVE A BIGGER SUN ROOF BEHIND THIS SMALL ONE THAT IS RIGHT ABOVE THEIR SEATS AND I'M SURE IT COULD EXPLODE NEXT. I HAD TO PLACE MY SONS BLANKET ABOVE THEIR HEADS TO KEEP THE GLASS THAT WAS STILL ATTACHED FROM CRUMBLING AND FALLING ON THEM OR IN THEIR EYES DURING THE REST OF THE WAY HOME. THE GLASS WAS CRUMBLING LIKE COOKIE CRUMBS AND IT WAS NOT SAFE FOR THEM IN THE BACK AT ALL. THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE FOR ALL PEOPLE IN THE VEHICLE,  INCLUDING SURROUNDING VEHICLES AND ROAD SAFETY THAT SHOULD NOT BE IGNORED OR TAKEN LIGHTLY.  *TR",

THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE SINCE I GOT IT BUT I WAS ABLE TO LIMIT MY NIGHT TIME DRIVING UNTIL RECENTLY. NOW I HAVE COME TO REALIZE HOW DANGEROUS THE INABILITY TO SEE INTO THE TURNS YOU ARE MAKING IS. IN OCTOBER 2015, I WAS TURNING RIGHT ON TO A BUSY STATE HIGHWAY AT NIGHT. BECAUSE THE HEADLIGHTS DO NOT ILLUMINATE THE ROAD THROUGH THE TURN, I COULD NOT SEE WHERE MY LANE WAS, OVERESTIMATED THE DISTANCE AND THEN REALIZED AS I STRAIGHTENED THE VEHICLE THAT I WAS IN THE LANE OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC TRAVELING AT 60 MPH FROM A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 1/4 MILE! IF I HAD NOT QUICKLY MOVED INTO THE CORRECT LANE, MANY PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN INJURED OR KILLED. THIS INCIDENT PROMPTED ME TO REALIZE HOW DANGEROUS THESE HEADLIGHTS ARE AND TO FORMALLY REPORT THE PROBLEM HERE AND TO THE FORD CO. AFTER THIS INCIDENT,I TOOK MY EXPLORER TO MY FORD DEALER WHO CHECKED THE HEADLIGHTS AND TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS AN \"ENGINEERING/DESIGN FLAW\" THAT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT COULD NOT FIX. I THEN FILED A SAFETY COMPLAINT WITH THE FORD CO. A REPRESENTATIVE CALLED ME WITHIN 48 HRS. SHE EXPLAINED THAT SHE HAD TALKED TO MY FORD SERVICE DEPARTMENT WHO TOLD HER THAT THERE WAS A HEADLIGHT ILLUMINATION PROBLEM. SHE ALSO STATED THAT AS OF THIS TIME, FORD CONSIDERS THE HEADLIGHTS TO BE WORKING WITHIN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL. SHE STATED THAT I NEEDED TO FILE A COMPLAINT HERE AND THAT FORD WOULD NOT CONSIDER THIS A PROBLEM UNTIL ENOUGH PEOPLE FILE COMPLAINTS THROUGH YOUR AGENCY AND THE FORD CO..

ON THE WEEKEND MY FAMILY AND I WILL TAKE THE INTERSTATE ROUTES. IN EARLY MARCH AS WE BEGAN OUR TRIP AND I ACCELERATED ONTO THE INTERSTATE THERE WAS A VERY HEAVY EXHAUST ODOR. THE ODOR WAS THICK ENOUGH THAT WE HAD TO LOWER EACH OF OUR WINDOWS. WE THOUGHT IT WAS STRANGE BUT PERHAPS JUST A ONE TIME OCCURRENCE BUT THAT WASN'T THE CASE. THE PROBLEM IS OCCURRING DURING HEAVY ACCELERATION ONLY, WITH NO AIR, WITH THE AIR CONDITIONING OR WITH THE HEAT ON. I HAVE TAKEN MY VEHICLE TO FORD 3 TIMES SINCE AUGUST 2014 FOR A TOTAL OF 26 DAYS IN THE SHOP IN HOPES OF GETTING THIS REPAIRED WITH NO LUCK. I DID HAVE A CASE OPEN WITH FORD CASE# [XXX] AND WAS TOLD LAST WEEK (11/13/14) BY CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSON \"[XXX]\" THAT MY CASE HAD BEEN CLOSED, REASON; \"THE ODOR I AM EXPERIENCING IS NORMAL\" I WAS NOT NOTIFIED BY FORD THAT THE CASE WAS BEING CLOSED NOR WAS THE DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE. I PLACED A CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTOR IN MY VEHICLE AND AFTER 3 TO 4 DAYS ON 11/01/14 RECEIVED A WARNING TO MOVE TO CLEAN AIR! MY VEHICLE IS UNDER FULL WARRANTY HOWEVER THAT IS USELESS AT THIS POINT. ON 11/15/14 I HAD TO TAKE A 6 HOUR ROUND TRIP WITH MY MOTHER, STEP FATHER AND MOTHER-IN-LAW WE HAD TO LOWER WITH WINDOW NO LESS THAN 8 TIMES DURING THE TRAVEL AND MY MOTHER HAD A VERY SICK HEADACHE AFTER THE TRIP. THIS PROBLEM IS REAL AND I HOPE YOU WILL GIVE IT THE TIME AND ATTENTION NEEDED TO MAKE SURE OTHER PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF AREN'T JUST BRUSHED OFF BY FORD. FORD HAS MY MONEY PAID IN FULL FOR A VEHICLE I AM FORCED TO DRIVE DAILY BECAUSE I HAVE NO OTHER TRANSPORTATION. AND YOU ASK DO I ALSO HAVE HEADACHES YES AND THEY ARE VERY REAL.

INSTEAD, THE CAR WENT BACKWARDS WHILE I STEPPED ON GAS. I WAS VERY CONFUSED, AND THOUGHT IT WAS MY ILLUSION. SO I STEPPED ON BRAKE AND CHECKED THE DRIVE PANEL, THE LIGHT FOR 'D' IS ON.  THEN I SWITCH TO 'P' AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS PUT TO 'D' AGAIN. HOWEVER, MY CAR STILL WENT BACKWARD AND MY REAR BUMP HIT THE FRONT BUMPER OF ANOTHER CAR WHICH PARK BEHIND MINE. THEN I GOT CONFIRMED THAT MY CAR WAS MALFUNCTIONING.    I WAS 100% SURE THAT THE GEAR OF MY CAR WAS IN 'D', SINCE I DID NOT SEE THE BACK UP MIRROR ON FROM THE LCD DISPLAY, AND THE INDICATING LIGHT OF THE GEAR WAS 'D'. AND MY CORPORATE PARKING LOT IS VERY FLAT.     AFTER THAT, I TURNED OFF MY EXPLORER, AND WENT OUT TO CHECK IF THERE IS DAMAGE TO THE CAR THAT I HIT. THEN I RESTART MY EXPLORER, PUT GEAR SHIFT IN 'D' AND IT WENT BACK TO NORMAL.    I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT HAPPENED TO MY NEW CAR PURCHASED ONLY ABOUT A MONTH.  THIS PROBLEM MADE ME PANIC.
