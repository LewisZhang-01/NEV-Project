AT 4,544 MILES THE RADIATOR BLEW APART. (DRIVING HIGHWAY/TOWING) THIS WAS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY AFTER FIGHTING WITH FORD.

AT 21432 MILES THE POWER STEERING PUMP WENT AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.(DRIVING/TOWING/LOCAL) SHOP STATED THAT \"FLUID WAS CONTAMINATED\" (THIS TRUCK HAS ONLY BEEN SERVICED BY FORD) AT 22215 MILES I HAD TO HAVE THE LEFT REAR AXLE SEAL, BRAKE PADS AND LOWER CAC HOSE FOR TURBO REPLACED.( DRIVING HIGHWAY/TOWING) NOW AT 29,017 MILES THE RADIATOR TANKS HAVE SEPARATED FROM THE CORE AND NEED TO BE REPLACED AGAIN ALONG WITH THE CRANK SEAL AND ANOTHER POWER STEERING PUMP.( COMBINATION, HIGHWAY/LOCAL/TOWING? NOT TOWING) I HAVE CHECKED WITH FORD AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND THEY REFUSE TO COVER ANY OF THIS, OR ANY PART, UNDER WARRANTY. I HAVE ALSO DONE RESEARCH ON THESE TRUCKS HAVING FOUND MANY OTHER OWNERS HAVING THE SAME COOLING SYSTEM ISSUES ALONG WITH OTHER ISSUES THAT FORD REFUSED TO COVER. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE, I THINK THEY NEED TO HAVE A RECALL ON THE COOLING SYSTEMS IN THEIR TRUCKS. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO READ THIS. I WOULD APPRECIATE A RESPONSE.

THE RE-CALIBRATION CAUSED THE TRUCK TO GO INTO \"LIMP HOME\" MODE EVERYTIME THE WATER IN FUEL SENSOR CAME ON.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AS THESE DIESEL TRUCKS ARE USED TO HAUL HEAVY EQUIPMENT AND SOMETIMES ON THE INTERSTATE AT HIGH RATES OF SPEED.  THE LIMP HOME MODE SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT WARNING TAKES THE THROTTLE AWAY AND THE TRUCK WON'T GO OVER ABOUT 30 MPH WHICH COULD CAUSE VERY SERIOUS WRECKS WITH THAT KIND OF WEIGHT JUST STOPPING IN FRONT OF OTHER VEHICLES GOING 50-80 MPH.  ONCE STOPPED, YOU HAVE TO TURN VEHICLE OFF, PRETEND TO DRAIN THE FUEL AND YOU ARE GOOD FOR ANOTHER HOUR OR SO.  IT GOT TO WHERE THE TRUCK WAS DOING THIS AT LEAST 5 TIMES A DAY.

HE SAID THAT FORD HAS AGREED THAT IT HAS A \"QUALITY ISSUE\" THE CONTROLLER IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ELECTRIC OVER HYDRAULIC BRAKING SYSTEMS.  FORD DID NOT TELL HIM OF ANY PLANS TO CORRECT THE ISSUE   I THEN LEARNED FROM A FORD DEALER SERVICE TECH. THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO FIX IT.   FORD'S CUSTOMER CARE CENTER SAID THEY WERE UNAWARE OF ANY SUCH PROBLEMS  BUT CONSULTED WITH A FORD \"REP\" WHO DID CONFIRM  THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM BUT THAT FORD HAS NOT ISSUED ANY ADVICE TO ITS DEALERS ABOUT THE PROBLEM, HAS NOT ISSUED ANY SORT OF RECALL, AND SUGGESTS THAT I PURCHASE AND HAVE INSTALLED AN AFTERMARKET TRAILER BRAKE CONTROL SYSTEM TO \"REPLACE\" FORD'S OWN SYSTEM.
