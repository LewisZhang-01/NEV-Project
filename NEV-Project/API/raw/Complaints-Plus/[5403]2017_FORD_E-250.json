THE TEMPERATURE INSIDE WILL CHANGE BY 10 DEGREES IN EXTREME COLD AND HOT WEATHER.  THIS NECESSITATES TAKING ONES EYES OFF THE ROAD AND LOOKING DOWN AT THE CONTROLS TO RESET THE RECIRCULATION MODE. THIS HAS OCCURRED SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED NEW AND IS CONTINUALLY OCCURRING. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A FORD DEALERSHIP ON 12/5/2017 AND THE DEALERSHIP SAID NOTHING COULD BE DONE TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEM.   THIS IS MORE HAZARDOUS THAN CELL PHONE USAGE AS ONE CAN RAISE THE CELL PHONE TO EYE OR EAR LEVEL TO USE IT.   THIS COMPUTER PROGRAMMING FOR THE RECIRCULATION MODE WILL CAUSE NUMEROUS ACCIDENTS THAT WILL BE ATTRIBUTED TO RECKLESS DRIVING OR LOSS OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. THERE IS A SIMPLE FIX TO REPROGRAM THE COMPUTER HOWEVER FORD WILL NOT DO IT.  SO FAR I HAVE AVOIDED AN ACCIDENT, BUT I CAN ASSURE NHTSA ACCIDENTS, INJURIES, AND FATALITIES WILL OCCUR BECAUSE OF THIS.  PLEASE FORCE FORD TO RECALL THESE VEHICLES TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM",
