SEEMED AT FIRST TO BE STIFFER WHEN IT WAS COLD SO ATTRIBUTED IT TO WINTER COLD. THEN AT THE END OF MARCH 2013, I WAS TURNING AND HEARD A CLUNK AS IF I HAD HIT A POTHOLE. I HEARD IT AGAIN ON THE SAME DAY AND THEN HEARD A SQUEAK AS IF THE SPRINGS NEEDED OILING. I STOPPED AT MY LOCAL REPAIR SHOP. THE MECHANIC OILED SOMETHING - DROVE IT AND DIDN'T HEAR A CLUNK. THREE DAYS LATER I TOOK IT TO HIM AND SAID IT IS CLUNKING REGULARLY AND THE STEERING STILL SEEMS STIFF. HE REPLACED UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS THAT HAD GONE BAD, CONTROL ARMS, AND TIE RODS THAT HAD PLAY IN THEM. THIS AT 82,000 MILES.  THESE REPAIRS ARE RIDICULOUS FOR 82,000 MILES. AFTER SPENDING $1400 I AM STILL HAVING TIGHT STEERING. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT DODGE EXECUTIVES, BUT I CAN'T AFFORD REPAIRS LIKE THIS. THE MOST COMPLAINTS LISTED FOR THIS MODEL AND YEAR ARE FOR STEERING AND I'VE HEARD FROM THE DEALER THAT THE BALL JOINTS GO OUT EARLY - AS MINE DID.

THE BRAKES WOULD GRAB INTERMITTENTLY WHEN DESCENDING A HILL CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO SHIMMER AND SHAKE VICIOUSLY.  THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN IN AND REPLACEMENT PARTS WERE FREE.  TOTAL DAYS LOST 2.  THE SECOND INCIDENT OCCURRED ON MAY 30, 2007.  WE WERE ON VACATION IN WI AND THE VEHICLE WOULDN'TSTART.   WE WERE MADE TO WAIT FOR A TOW TRUCK THAT HAD TO DRIVE AN HOUR AWAY TO BE ABLE TO TOW US LESS THAN 15 MILES.  WE HAD TO RENT A VEHICLE (CAR) THAT I WAS UNABLE TO USE FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES, TO RETURN HOME FOR MY SPOUSE TO BE ABLE TO GET TO WORK.  THIS MEANT WE HAD TO DRIVE BACK WITH THE RENTAL TO PICK UP THE VEHICLE. IT WAS 4 DAYS WITH THE RENTAL.  THE DIAGNOSIS COULD NOT BE MADE WITH THE TOOL UNTIL THE MASTER COMPUTER SYSTEM WAS REPLACED.  AFTER THIS WAS DONE, NOTHING WRONG. THE FIRST TIME IT WAS USED AFTER OUR RETURN HOME, I DROVE LESS THAN 15 MILES AND IT DID THE SAME THING, WOULDN'T START.  THE ENGINE WOULD CRANK BUT NOT TURN OVER.  AGAIN, NO WARNING LIGHTS.  I CALLED THE TOWING SERVICE PROVIDED BY DAIMLER, I  WAITED AN HOUR AND 45 MINUTES.  I DECIDED TO TRY IT AGAIN JUST SECONDS BEFORE THE TOW GUY ARRIVED AND IT STARTED.   I DECIDED TO NOT HAVE IT TAKEN IN FOR REPAIR, THE MANAGER OF THE TOW SERVICE REASSURED ME, I PANICKED AND IT WAS A VAPOR LOCK.  OH YEAH THIS WAS ON JUNE 8, 2007 JUST 4 DAYS AFTER RECEIVING OUR VEHICLE BACK.  I BELIEVED HIM.

THE VEHICLE STALLED SEVERAL MORE TIMES IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND WHERE SEVERAL CARS BEHIND ME STARTED TO MOVE IN ANTICIPATION OF MY VEHICLE MOVING AND ALMOST HIT MY CAR.     NOT RISKING A POTENTIAL ACCIDENT, I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP REPAIR SHOP. THE SHOP STATED IT WAS THE GAS QUALITY AND NO CODES WERE PRESENT IN THE COMPUTER. IT WAS ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT I SHOULD TRY A DIFFERENT GAS!     I THEN DID SOME RESEARCH ON THIS ISSUE (BECAUSE I KNEW IT WAS NOT THE GAS) AND IT WAS REVEALED TOO ME THAT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN DODGE TRUCKS. THE  RESPONSE FROM THE DEALERSHIP IS ALSO COMMON, WITH THIS PROBLEM (AND IT HAPPENED TO ME) THAT NO CODES CAME UP IN THE COMPUTER, THEREFORE CANNOT BE FIXED.   THIS IS A SERIOUS ACCIDENT JUST WAITING TO HAPPEN. *JB",
