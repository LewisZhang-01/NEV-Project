On the way home (187 mile trip), about \u00be of the trip, I was driving about 55 mph on 701 North and the steering felt as if it was sticking to the point where moving the wheel took a  effort to unstick it which put me into oncoming traffic in the other lane. I almost was involved in a head-on collision! The vehicle has only 39K miles on it. The previous owner had this issue in April of 2008 and took it to a BMW dealer who advised them that the repair would cost $2,950.00. The previous owner declined the repair because they couldn\u2019t afford it and the dealer told them that BMW will probably issue a recall AS HUNDRES OF Z4 OWNERS HAVE HAD THIS SAME ISSUE. The vehicle also drifts to the left and attempts by the previous owner to have the vehicle aligned to correct this have failed. The vehicle had only 13K on the odometer at the time BMW advised of the faulty steering column.",

IT IS QUITE DISCONCERTING AND HAS ALMOST RESULTED IN ME SIDE SWIPING ONCOMING VEHICLES ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. I HAVE LEARNED THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM THAT BMW NEVER ADDRESSED.     RESEARCHING THE MATTER I'VE LEARNED THAT A STEERING COLUMN REPLACEMENT AND LABOR WOULD BE IN THE $3000-4500 RANGE AND THE PROBLEM WOULD LIKELY REOCCUR IN THE FUTURE DUE TO FAULTY DESIGN. WORSE, AS MOST PEOPLE IN MY POSITION ARE UNABLE TO PERFORM A REPAIR AT THAT COST, I'VE FOUND NUMEROUS PEOPLE MANIPULATING THEIR STEERING COLUMNS WITH MIXED SUCCESS ULTIMATELY CREATING AN EVEN MORE DANGEROUS POTENTIAL SITUATION. THESE METHODS INCLUDE DRILLING INTO THE STEERING COLUMN AND ADDING GREASES AND LUBRICANTS THAT WERE NOT DESIGNED TO WORK WITH THE VEHICLE.     THIS IS A WELL-KNOWN PROBLEM, WITH NO SHORTAGE OF RECORDS AND ACCOUNTS ESTABLISHING THIS ISN'T A \"IF IT HAPPENS\", BUT WHEN IT HAPPENS. DRIVE A VEHICLE WITH THIS PROBLEM, I DARE YOU, AND TELL ME IT IS NOT A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD. DISAPPOINTED. I'D APPRECIATE IF BMW WOULD REACH OUT TO ME AND REMEDY THE ISSUE. THERE IS NO REASON THAT A STEERING WHEEL, ONE OF THE MOST BASIC AND NECESSARY SYSTEMS ON A CAR TO MAINTAIN CONTROL, SHOULD HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BE DEFECTIVE WITH NO REMEDY AT THE COST OF THE MANUFACTURER. THE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY BY BMW AND \"DO IT YOURSELF\" REMEDIES WILL UNDOUBTEDLY RESULT IN INJURY OR DEATH IF THEY HAVE NOT ALREADY.

I RESEARCHED THIS ON MULTIPLE FORUMS AND IT APPEARS THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OF SIMILAR PROBLEMS. MOST RELATE TO ISSUES IN HOT TEMPERATURES AND TO SPEED. PROBLEM WAS VERY NOTICEABLE LAST EVENING AT 70 DEGREES. HERE ARE THE SYMPTOMS...    AT LOW SPEEDS (UNDER 20MPH) STEERING IS VERY LIGHT AND SMOOTH, NO ISSUES AT ALL. AS SPEED INCREASES, THE STEERING GETS HEAVIER (AS IT SHOULD) BUT DEVELOPS A \"DETENT\" AT STRAIGHT CENTER. THE FASTER THE SPEED, THE MORE EFFORT NEEDED TO OVERCOME THE DETENT RESISTANCE, TO THE POINT THAT IT BECOMES EASY TO OVERSTEER THE CAR. THIS CAN BE REAL SCARY DURING AVOIDANCE MANEUVERS AND QUICK LANE CHANGES. THE HOT WEATHER JUST MAKES IT WORSE.  FROM WHAT I KNOW FROM RESEARCH, THE WAY TO FIX THIS IS DO REPLACE THE WHOLE STEERING COLUMN.  I M SINCERE ASKING FOR HELP.  I CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE IT CHANGE ON MY OWN WHEN IS IT MORE LIKE BMW' ENGINEER PROBLEMS.  I HOPE YOU GUYS CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BEFORE IT GET TOO SERIOUS.  THANKS IN ADVANCE.

WORSE THAN JUST HEAVY STEERING IS THE FACT THAT IT NEEDS EXTRA FORCE TO GET THE STEERING WHEEL \"UNSTUCK\" BUT THEN THE ASSIST KICKS IN AND YOU'RE OVER-COMPENSATING WHICH CAUSES ZIG-ZAGGING. IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN MY LANE ON THE INTERSTATE AND AT ONE POINT I DROPPED TWO WHEELS ON THE SHOULDER. I HAVE NOW CONTACTED BMW CORPORATE AND THEY TELL ME THEY'RE BEING GENEROUS BY REPLACING THE KNOWN-FAULTY STEERING RACK -- SO LONG AS I PAY $1,000+ IN LABOR. I THINK THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS. IT IS WRONG THAT THIS KNOWN DEFECT COSTS THE CONSUMER ANY MONEY TO REPLACE. BMW SHOULD COVER PARTS AND LABOR.

AS A RESULT, I TURN THE STEERING WHEEL MORE AND THEN SUDDENLY THE CAR TURNS.  IMMEDIATELY, I HAVE TO TURN THE WHEEL BACK THE OTHER WAY TO AVOID GOING OFF THE ROAD.  THE PROBLEM IS REPEATED WHEN I TURN BACK IN THE OTHER DIRECTION AND I ESSENTIALLY END UP WEAVING DOWN THE ROAD. WHEN I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN TO HAVE IT CHECKED AFTER THE FIRST OCCURRENCE, THE SYMPTOM COULDN'T BE REPRODUCED BY THE SERVICEMEN WHO LOOKED AT IT.  IN RETROSPECT, I'VE REALIZED THAT I WAS ALWAYS HAVING THE CAR CHECKED WHEN IT WAS COOL OUT (MORNINGS & I LIVED NEAR LAKE SUPERIOR), BUT THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO OCCUR ONLY WHEN IT IS HOT OUTSIDE (OVER 70 TO 80 DEGREES).  SINCE I COULDN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM, I HAVE DRAMATICALLY REDUCED MY DRIVING WITH THIS VEHICLE.  HOWEVER, AFTER RECENTLY MOVING TO A DIFFERENT PART OF THE COUNTRY, I MENTIONED THE PROBLEM TO A NEW SERVICEMAN LAST MONTH. HE SAID THIS WAS A WELL KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE Z4 STEERING BEARINGS.  AFTER SPENDING SOME TIME SEARCHING ON THE INTERNET, I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED THIS SAME PROBLEM (INCLUDING TO THIS WEBSITE). I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF A SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH ANY OTHER VEHICLE; IT CERTAINLY SEEMS TO ME THIS IS SOME SORT OF DESIGN FLAW.  IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE STEERING BEARINGS WEARING OUT DUE TO NORMAL \"WEAR AND TEAR\" WITH ONLY 34,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE.

THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAPPEN ON PERFECTLY SMOOTH ROADS.      THIS APPEARS IN TWO WAYS.    ON BUMPY ROADS, THE CAR WILL SUDDENLY JERK TO EITHER THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT AND REQUIRE AGGRESSIVE CORRECTIONS TO THE STEERING WHEEL TO KEEP THE CAR FROM VEERING OUT OF IT'S LANE.  THIS SUDDEN JERKING TO THE LEFT OR THE RIGHT OCCURS WITHOUT WARNING, SO CORRECTIONS TO THE STEERING WHEEL TO KEEP THE CAR IN ITS LANE CAN NOT BE MADE UNTIL THE CAR HAS ACTUALLY JERKED ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.  ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS THE CAR HAS CROSSED THE CENTER LINE INTO THE ONCOMING LANE OR ONTO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD BEFORE I COULD REACT. DRIVING THE CAR AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS (65-70MPH) TAKES CONSTANT VIGILANCE AND REQUIRES SLOWING DOWN TO SPEEDS FAR BELOW THE SPEED LIMIT (45-50MPH) ON THE ROUGHEST OF PAVEMENT TO MAKE ME FEEL I CAN KEEP THE CAR UNDER CONTROL AND IN MY LANE.    THE SECOND WAY THIS CAR IS DIFFICULT TO STEER IS WHEN THERE ARE RUTES WORN IN THE ROAD FROM HEAVY TRAFFIC. (MOST HIGHWAYS)  WHEN ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE LANES, THE CAR WILL NOT MOVE TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT AS INPUT IS GIVEN TO THE STEERING WHEEL.  AS MORE INPUT IS GIVEN, THE CAR WILL SUDDENLY JUMP IN THE DIRECTION OF STEERING INPUT, REQUIRING INPUT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO KEEP THE CAR FROM MOVING OVER TO FAR AND CROSSING INTO A LANE NOT INTENDED.  THIS DIFFICULTY IN STEERING IS DETECTABLE WHEN CHANGING LANES IS STARTED AND THE CAR DOES NOT REACT TO THE INITIAL STEERING INPUT.  WITH PRACTICE, I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP THE SKILL TO TIME MY CORRECTIVE INPUT TO THE STEERING AS THE CAR COMPLETES ITS LANE CHANGE.  EVEN WITH MY GETTING USED TO THIS CONDITION, LANE CHANGES ARE NOT SMOOTH, BUT JERKY MANEUVERS INSTEAD.

        "summary": "1. FOR ABOUT 2 YEARS I HAVE NOTICED THAT SOMETHING HAS BEEN WRONG WITH MY 2003 BMW Z4'S STEERING.  THE ONSET WAS VERY INSIDIOUS.  I FIRST NOTICED A FEELING THAT THE STEERING WOULD STICK AND REQUIRE SLIGHT EXTRA FORCE TO MAKE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS.  THIS SEEMED TO OCCUR AFTER THE CAR HAD BEEN OUT SITTING IN THE SUN.  AT THAT TIME IT WAS MORE OF AN ANNOYANCE THAN A PROBLEM.  THE STEERING WOULD SOON RETURN TO NORMAL.  I REMEMBER HAVING THE STEERING COMPLAINT MORE OFTEN OVER THE 2 YEAR PERIOD BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT I KNEW THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE I NEEDED TO RESOLVE.    2. I WAS MAKING A 250 MILE DRIVE BACK TO ORLANDO ON THE TURNPIKE WHEN THE STEERING PROBLEM RETURNED.  IT WAS WORSE THAN EVER.  THERE WAS A DANGEROUS \"LOCKED ON CENTER\" FEELING AT HIGHWAY SPEED.  MINOR ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED FORCE SUCH THAT THE STEERING JERKED AND THEN REQUIRED ANOTHER FORCEFUL JERK TO CORRECT.  THE PROBLEM IS DANGEROUS IN THAT IT TAKES MUCH EFFORT TO KEEP THE CAR IN THE LANE AT HIGHWAY SPEED.  WHEN I EXITED AND DROVE AT LOW SPEED THE STEERING RETURNED TO NORMAL.  I RESEARCHED THIS PHENOMENA AND FOUND MANY OTHER Z4 OWNERS WITH THE SAME STEERING PROBLEM.  APPARENTLY THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING SYSTEM ON THE Z4.  MY PROBLEMS REFLECTED THOSE OF OTHER OWNERS.  THE \"LOCKED ON CENTER\" FEELING IS WORSE ON HOT DAYS AND AT HIGH SPEEDS.  THE PROBLEM OCCURS EVERY TIME I DRIVE ON THE HIGHWAY AND I HAVE SINCE STOPPED DRIVING THAT VEHICLE.   I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING IT ON THE HIGHWAY BOTH FOR MY SAFETY AND THAT OF OTHER DRIVERS ON THE ROAD.    3. THE CAR HAS YET TO BE REPAIRED.  THE OTHER Z4 OWNERS SUGGESTED I FILE THIS COMPLAINT, AS THEY HAVE HAD MUCH TROUBLE CONVINCING THEIR BMW DEALERSHIPS OF THE DESIGN FLAW/FAILURE OF THE EPS SYSTEM. *TR    UPDATED 01/25/10 *BF  UPDATED 01/26/10",

IT FEELS LIKE IT LOCKS IN PLACE AND WHEN ADJUSTMENTS ARE ATTEMPTED TO CORRECT THE STEERING, YOU ACTUALLY OVER ADJUST BECAUSE IT STICKS AND YOU HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME REMAINING IN YOUR LANE.

ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED IS THE AIRBAG LIGHTS (BOTH IN THE DASH AND ON THE CONSOLE) WERE ON.
