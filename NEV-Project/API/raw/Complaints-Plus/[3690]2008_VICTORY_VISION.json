WE HAD TRAVELED ABOUT FOUR FEET WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO INCREASE THE THROTTLE.  THE THROTTLE FAILED TO OPEN WITH THE NORMAL AMOUNT OF TORQUE.  THE PARKING LOT WAS SLOPING TO THE LEFT, THAT IS, WE WERE TRAVELING ACROSS A SLOPE.  THE LOSS OF THE NEEDED INCREASED FORWARD MOMENTUM IMMEDIATELY CAUSED A REDUCTION IN THE STABILITY OF THE MOTORCYCLE.  THE DISTANCE TO THE GROUND ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE MOTORCYCLE WAS GREATER THAN THE RIGHT , DUE TO THE SLOPE.  THE LOSS OF FORWARD MOMENTUM REDUCED GREATLY THE STABILITY OF THE MOTORCYCLE.  THE MOTORCYCLE FELL TO THE LEFT.  I WAS ABLE TO PARTIALLY BRACE THE FALL WITH MY LEFT FOOT.  NEITHER MY WIFE NOR I SUFFERED ANY INJURIES.  I SPRAINED MY LEFT ANKLE, AND MY WIFE HIT HER ARM ON THE TRUNK.  INJURIES DID NOT REQUIRE MEDICAL ATTENTION.  MY WIFE IS A REGISTERED NURSE.  THE DESIGN OF THE MOTORCYCLE CAUSED VERY LITTLE DAMAGE AND PREVENTED MY LEG FROM BEING PINNED BENEATH THE MOTORCYCLE.  2. THE FAILURE, HOW OFTEN IT OCCURS, ITS CONSEQUENCES:  THIS IS ABOUT THE SEVENTH OR EIGHT TIME IT HAS OCCURRED.  IT WAS FIRST NOTICED AND BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE DEALER FOLLOWING HIS REPLACEMENT OF A FAILED CYLINDER HEAD.  THE CONSEQUENCES ARE A LOSS OF FORWARD MOMENTUM, ENDANGERING THE STABILITY OF THE MOTORCYCLE.  IT OCCURS ON WHEN ATTEMPTING TO OPEN A CLOSED THROTTLE.  A MARKED INCREASE IN THE TORQUE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A GIVEN INCREASE IN ENGINE SPEED IS NOTICED.  IF CAUGHT OFF GUARD, IT CAN REQUIRE THE OPERATOR TO INCREASE GREATLY THE TORQUE APPLIED TO THE THROTTLE, AND REQUIRE QUICK REACTION.  3. WHAT WAS DONE TO CORRECT THE FAILURE:  IT WAS RETURNED TO THE DEALER ON THREE OCCASIONS.  THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO FIND THE TROUBLE.  AFTER THE MOST RECENT ATTEMPT HE SAID HE TRIED, ALONG WITH THE MANUFACTURER TO FIND THE PROBLEM.  NO PARTS WERE REPLACED OR REPAIRED.  PLEASE REFER TO NUMBER 1.  *TR",
