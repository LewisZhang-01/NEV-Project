CONTINUING TO INTERMITTENTLY ACT UP WHEN STARTING, IT ALSO STARTED TO SHOW OTHER PROBLEMS.

I TURNED IT OFF RAN INSIDE AND WHEN I CAME BACK OUT TO SHOW OTHERS THE ISSUE IT STARTED WITHOUT A PROBLEM AND DID NOT HAVE THE MESSAGE ANY MORE. STILL HAVE THE TURNOVER HESITATION, I CONTINUE TO DRIVE IT HOWEVER IT STARTED TO SHAKE AND SHOW THE SAME ENGINE POWER REDUCED MESSAGE AS I PULLED INTO MY APARTMENT COMPLEX. ALSO HAS DONE THIS WHEN LEAVING AND TURNING INTO A MAIN ROAD, CAUSING US TO PULL OVER AND WAIT TO START IT AGAIN. TOOK IT TO GET CODES TESTED AGAIN AND IT PULLED UP A DIDN'T MATCH CODE. AFTER DOING RESEARCH TONS OF OTHERS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND WORSE. MANY SHOWED THE SOLUTION TO BE REPLACING THE THROTTLE BODY AND THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR WHICH WE DID. SLIGHT HESITATION ON THE START UP BUT TOOK IT AROUND THE BLOCK NO ISSUES. WENT TO TEST IT ON THE HIGHWAY AND BEFORE WE EVEN MADE IT THE ENGINE POWER REDUCED CAME ON AND CAR SHOOK AGAIN. THERE AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM AND MANY HAVE NOT FOUND THE FIX. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING SINCE WE CANNOT RETURN THE PART AFTER IT'S BEEN INSTALLED.

AFTER SPENDING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO TRY AND CORRECT THE PROBLEM I GAVE UP AND HAVE BEEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE THE WAY THAT IS FOR AWHILE NOW.

THE FOLLOWING IS A PERSONAL EXPERIENCE NEARLY RESULTING IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF DEFECTIVE BRAKES ON MY 2007 CHEVROLET IMPALA VEHICLE.  RECENTLY WHILE TRAVELING ALONG AN INTERSTATE HIGHWAY WITH MY WIFE DRIVING, WE WERE SUDDENLY FACED WITH AN PANIC STOPPING REQUIREMENT BECAUSE OF BACKED UP TRAFFIC ON A CURVE. MY WIFE APPLIED THE BRAKES HEAVILY AND THE CAR WENT INTO SUCH A VIOLENT FRONT SHAKING FIT THAT SHE PANICKED AND RELEASE THE BRAKE TO STOP THE SHAKING AND HAD TO SWERVE TO AVOID STOPPED CARS IN FRONT OF US. THE NHTSA SHOULD FORCE CHEVROLET TO RECALL ALL CHEVROLET VEHICLES WITH THIS PROBLEM AND CORRECT IT BEFORE MAJOR ACCIDENTS HAPPEN WITH LOSS OF PROPERTY AND LIFE.

LAST FALL WHEN THE VEHICLE HAD JUST OVER 90,000 MILES, I BEGAN HAVING PROBLEMS FIRST WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL DROPPING OFF SPEED AND NOT RESETTING.  THIS QUICKLY ADVANCED TO A SHUTTERING FEEL WHEN ACCELERATING AND OCCASIONALLY PICKING UP SPEED AND WITHIN 50 MILES THE CAR REFUSED TO MOVE AFTER A STOP LIGHT.  I TURNED IT OFF AND RESTARTED THE ENGINE AND AFTER PUTTING IT INTO DRIVE, MANAGED TO GET IT TO A NEARBY FORMER CHEVY DEALER.  THEY DETERMINED THE TRANSMISSION WAS TOTALLY SLIPPING AND REQUIRED REPLACEMENT.  CHEVY STOOD BY THE 100K POWER-TRAIN  WARRANTY WITH A NO-COST REPLACEMENT AND INSTALLED A NEW TRANSMISSION, ISSUING A 12,000 MI WARRANTY.  TODAY, AT 111,000 MILES, LESS THAN 20,000 INTO THE NEW TRANSMISSION, THE PROBLEM RETURNED.  THE FIRST TIME IT WAS ON FLAT GROUND AND I WAS SIMPLY A STALLED NUISANCE IN TRAFFIC.  THIS TIME, I WAS  GOING UP A HILL AND HAD STOPPED FOR A LIGHT.  THE CAR BEGAN TO ROLL BACK DOWN THE HILL, I HAD DIFFICULTY BRAKING AND NEARLY GOT STRUCK BY A LARGE TRUCK.  IT WOULD NOT MOVE FORWARD UNTIL I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND THEN WITH A THUDS AND JERKS I WAS ABLE TO MOVE IT TO A SAFE PARKING SPOT.  THIS TIME I DID NOT HAVE THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL BUT DID HAVE A BIT OF WHAT I NOW RECOGNIZE WAS TRANSMISSION SLIP BUT I ATTRIBUTED TO THE ANTI-SLIP BRAKES ON ICE.  THIS HAPPENED A COUPLE OF TIMES.  FROM THE EARLY SHUDDERS, LESS THAN 400 MILES ELAPSED.  I WAS FORTUNATE BOTH TIMES. *TR",

I TURNED INTO THE ROAD TO LAUREL BAYE FROM RUTHERFORD ROAD. THIS IS A SHARP RIGHT TURN INTO A ROAD THAT GOES UPHILL. HALFWAY THROUGH THE TURN MY CAR'S STEERING WHEEL LOCKED COMPLETELY. I COULD NOT TURN MY WHEELS AT ALL. THE CAR WAS RUNNING FINE, AND ALL OTHER SYSTEMS IN THE CAR WORKED, BUT MY STEERING WHEEL COULD NOT BE MOVED. I PUT ON MY BRAKES, WHICH WORKED, AND DROVE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE NARROW ROAD. I TURNED OFF THE MOTOR, AND WAITED A FEW SECONDS. THEN I TURNED MY CAR BACK ON. THE WHEELS WERE STILL LOCKED. AT THAT TIME ANOTHER CAR DROVE UP, AND THE DRIVER GOT OUT AND TRIED TO GET MY CAR WHEELS TO MOVE, WITH NO SUCCESS. IN TURN, A POLICEMAN, AND MY NEIGHBOR TRIED TO MAKE THE CAR WHEEL TURN, BUT NO SUCCESS.

THE SERVICE MAN SAID THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. THE NEXT DAY I CALLED AND THREATENED TO WRITE LETTERS OF COMPLAINT. SO THEY TOOK THE CAR AGAIN, AND KEPT IT FOR 11 DAYS TESTING IT, AND STILL REPORTED THEY COULD FIND NOTHING THAT HAD CAUSED THE WHEELS TO LOCK. IN THE MEANTIME I SEARCHED THE INTERNET AND FOUND MANY REPORTS OF GM CARS WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM. THERE HAVE BEEN CLASS ACTION SUITS, AND SUITS WHICH HAVE BEEN SETTLED BY GM.

ON RETURN AND AFTER SUCCESSFULLY STARTING THE CAR I FOUND THE STICK SHIFT ACCESS BUTTON COULD NOT BE PUSHED, DESPITE FOLLOWING THE RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES, AND THE CAR WAS STUCK IN PARK. IT WAS TOWED TO THE LOCAL GM DEALER FOR $100. AFTER SIX DAYS AND $150 IN EXPENSES FOR ANOTHER CAR THE GM DEALER REPORTED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS A \"BROKEN GROUND WIRE\" IN THE \"SHIFT LOCK SOLENOID CONNECTOR\" [INSIDE THE CENTRE CONSOLE WHERE THE SHIFT LEVER IS LOCATED]. THE COST OF REPAIR WAS $137. MY INTERNET RESEARCH SHOWS THIS PROBLEM OCCURS OFTEN IN CHEVROLET IMPALAS, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE PROBLEM IS IN THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF THE VEHICLE. THIS PROBLEM COULD BE LIFE THREATENING IF THE PROBLEM OCCURS IN A REMOTE AREA AT THIS TEMPERATURE. I THOUGHT THIS WAS A POWER TRAIN PROBLEM SINCE THE PART ALLOWS THE TRANSMISSION TO ENGAGE, AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. GM CLAIMS IT IS NOT PART OF THE POWER TRAIN. MY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE PROBLEM COULD BE LIFE THREATENING, IS A DEFECT IN DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE, AND THAT THE PROBLEM IS A POWER TRAIN PROBLEM AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. *TR",

WE TOOK IT ON VACATION IN OCTOBER AND IT STARTED TO VIBRATE VERY BAD.  MY HUSBAND COMMENTED THAT WHEN WE GET BACK WE NEED TO TAKE IT IN.  WE TOOK IN IT IN OCTOBER OF 2008.  WE WERE TOLD THAT THE TIRES ON THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE WERE HANGING ON THREADS. THE DEALER DID REPLACE THE TIRES.  AT THAT TIME WE THOUGHT WELL MAYBE A BAD SET OF TIRES.  AT THAT TIME THE DEALER DID NOT BALANCE OR LINE UP THE TIRES. (WHICH THEY SHOULD HAVE)  WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE TIRES AND NOW AT 35,000.00 MILES THE VEHICLE NEEDS NEW TIRES AGAIN.  IT RIDES REALLY BAD AGAIN.  WE TOOK IT IN AGAIN AND FIRST THE DEALER, LINES IT UP, IT STILL DID NOT RIDE GOOD, THEN THEY BALANCED THE FRONT TIRES (NOT THE BACK AND I DON'T KNOW WHY??) I GUESS BECAUSE THEY ARE DOING THIS AT THEIR COST AND DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING MORE THAN THEY HAVE TO.  IT STILL DOES NOT RIDE WELL.  I WORK IN A BANK AND AFTER TALKING TO ANOTHER PERSON THEY HAVE PUT 3 SETS OF TIRES ON THEIRS IN 60,000 MILES.  ANOTHER PERSON HAS 35,000 MILES ON THEIR BRAND NEW 2008 AND THEY NEED NEW TIRES.  AFTER BRINGING THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE DEALER THEY SAID THEY HAVE HAD NUMEROUS CARS IN WITH THIS PROBLEM.  THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING ELSE FOR US.  I CONTACTED GENERAL MOTORS AND THEY ALSO WILL NOT DO ANYTHING.  THIS VEHICLE HAS A 100,000 MILE WARRANTY ON THE DRIVE TRAIN.

I LOOKED AND SAW ABOUT A 2 FOOT HOLE IN MY SUNROOF (THE SHADE WAS OPEN). I PULLED OFF THE ROAD AND CALLED THE POLICE. I WAS NOT NEAR AN OVERPASS, IT WAS NIGHT, NO CARS WERE AROUND. I DID NOT FIND AN OBJECT AROUND THE CAR OR IN THE CAR. THE FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NOT AN ASSAULT (SOMETHING WAS NOT THROWN AT THE CAR). I CALLED GM AND THEY REFERRED ME TO MY DEALER. I DROPPED THE CAR OFF TODAY BUT THE SERVICE MANAGER WAS VERY DOUBTFUL IT WOULD BE COVERED. HE KEPT INSISTING IT WAS A ROCK. THE STRANGE SIGNS THOUGH ARE THAT MY SUNROOF EXPLODED OUTWARD. THE GLASS IS CLEAR BUBBLED OUTWARD AND THE SHARDS STICK UP OUT OF THE CAR. I TOOK PICTURES OF THIS. I RESEARCHED THIS AND FOUND THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO MANY (ALTHOUGH NOT MY VEHICLE) BEFORE. THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THEY WOULD FIND THE IMPACT POINT AND SHOW ME WHEN THEY DID (HE ACTUALLY ASSUMED IT WAS A ROCK BEFORE EVEN LOOKING) BUT HE COULD NOT EXPLAIN THE OUTWARD GLASS PATTERN (EXCEPT TO SAY CRAZY THINGS HAPPEN WITH GLASS). HE LATER ADMITTED THAT HE HAD SEEN THIS BEFORE BUT NEVER ON AN IMPALA ONLY ON A CORVETTE AND THAT WAS A DEFECT. HE SAID IF THIS WAS A DEFECT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REPORTED. I TOLD HIM I WAS GOING TO REPORT THIS TO THE NHTSA BUT HE TOLD ME THAT GM WOULD DO THAT. AT THIS POINT THEY ARE INVESTIGATING ALTHOUGH HE SAID HE WAS VERY DOUBTFUL THAT ANYONE FROM GM WOULD COME OUT AND THAT I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO GO THROUGH MY INSURANCE. HE SAID IT IS COVERED IN FLORIDA WITH NO DEDUCTIBLE. LOOKED INTO THAT AND IT IS NOT TRUE, SUNROOFS ARE NOT COVERED. THIS IS CLEARLY A DEFECT. THIS CAR IS ONLY A YEAR OLD. THE VIOLENT WAY THIS SHATTERED WITH NO ONE AROUND AND THE ACTUAL BOWING OUT OF THE GLASS AND ALL THE GLASS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CAR IS PRETTY STRONG PROOF.
