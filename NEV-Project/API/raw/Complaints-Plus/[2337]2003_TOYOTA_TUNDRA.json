THE TOYOTA REPRESENTATIVE, JEFFERY M., CALLED MY DEALERSHIP AND TOLD ME THAT THE FRAME WAS NOT PERFORATED SO I AM NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE FRAME REPLACEMENT RECALL.  I ASKED JEFFERY MULTIPLE TIMES IF THE DEALER SAID THE FRAME IS SAFE OR NOT.  HE REFUSED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND WOULD ONLY STATE THAT MY FRAME IS NOT PERFORATED. THE NHTSA/TOYOTA 10MM PERFORATION CRITERIA IS INADEQUATE AND THE PHASE 2 APPLICATION BONDING FAILURE EXACERBATED MOISTURE AND ROAD SALT RETENTION.",

THE CONTACT WAS CONCERNED THE PASSENGERS IN THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT BE PROTECTED IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH. THE CONTACT REMOVED THE TRAILER FROM HIS VEHICLE AND PLACED IT IN THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE.

WHAT I GOT WAS THE MOST UNRELIABLE EXPENSIVE PIECE OF CRAP I HAVE EVER OWNED.  IT EVEN NEARLY RUINED OUR HONEYMOON.  WE TOOK THE TRUCK ON A ROAD TRIP TO SEE THE SOUTHWEST AND KICK OFF OUR MARRIAGE.  IT WAS VERY EXCITING THANKS TO TOYOTA.  AT THE GRAND CANYON WE HAD THE PLEASURE OF HUNTING DOWN THE LAST OVERPRICED BOTTLE OF POWER STEERING FLUID.  RATHER THAN RELAXING AT THE SOUTH RIM I HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LIMP THE TRUCK TO THE NEAREST SHOP.  THAT WAS OVER $1200 OUT OF OUR BUDGET.  THE NEXT OBSTACLE WAS EVEN MORE EXCITING.  WE DISCOVERED THE BACK TIRES WHERE READY TO FALL OFF AND THE FRONT WHEELS HAD DEVELOPED SOME ISSUE ALSO.  SO WE LIMPED THE TRUCK TO ELK CITY OKLAHOMA IN THE MIDST OF TORNADO WARNINGS.  WE EVEN GOT TO SPEND THE NIGHT IN A RUN DOWN MOTEL 6.  I THINK THEY RENTED ROOMS BY THE HOUR.  THAT WAS ANOTHER $1400 OVER OUR BUDGET FOR A TWO DAY STAY IN SCENIC ELK CITY.  AT LEAST WE GOT A FREE LOANER FROM THE FOLKS AT SMITH FAMILY NISSAN.  IT'S MORE THAN TOYOTA HAS DONE FOR US.  I HAD TO DRIVE UP TO KEENE TO JUST GET PUSHED RIGHT OUT THE DOOR POLITELY. THEY COULD HAVE AT LEAST SAVED ME THE TRIP BY SIMPLY RETURNING MY EMAIL.  WE GOT THE SAME TREATMENT FROM TOYOTA CORP.        AND FOR A SOUVENIR WE ARE LEFT WITH A VERY EXPENSIVE PIECE OF SCRAP METAL IN THE DRIVEWAY.   IT APPEARS AS THOUGH TOYOTA CHEEPED OUT ON THE STEEL FOR THE FRAME.  CHEAP CHINESE STEEL.  THE SOLUTION WAS TO SPRAY SOME CHEAP CRAP ON THE FRAME AND COVER UP THE PROBLEM.  IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE IT BREAKS IN HALF JUST SITTING IN THE DRIVEWAY.

HE APPLIED A UNDERCOAT BUT DIDN'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB AS IT HAS ALREADY  WORN OFF. I THEN CONTACTED TOYOTA THINKING THEY WOULD DO SOMETHING THEY OPENED A CLAIM NUMBER WHICH RESULTED IN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BEING DONE. I AM APPALLED THAT TOYOTA WILL NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT, I KNOW THAT THE TRUCK IS NOT NEW BUT TOYOTA IS KNOWN FOR THE QUALITY AND DURABILITY OF THEIR VEHICLES. I HAVE SPOKEN TO SEVERAL MECHANICS AND MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND THEY CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE TOYOTA MANUFACTURER WOULD ALLOW A UNSAFE VEHICLE TO BE DRIVEN ON THE ROADS AND HIGHWAYS. I DRIVE  MYSELF AND MY CHILDREN IN THIS VEHICLE AND I FEEL THIS SHOULD BE COVERED BY THE DEALER IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE BUT UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE NO OTHER VEHICLE TO DRIVE IN AND NO FUNDS TO PURCHASE A NEW ONE AS I AM STILL PAYING THE LOAN ON THIS ONE.

I THEN CONTACTED TOYOTA HEADQUARTERS AND THEY REVIEWED MY CASE AND SENT IT TO A CASE MANAGER.  THE CASE MANAGER CONTACTED ME 2 DAYS LATER AND SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO BECAUSE IT WAS A WARRANTY ISSUE AND IT HAD EXPIRED.  THIS IS TROUBLING TO COMPREHEND BECAUSE A CO-WORKER OF MINE WHO OWNS A 2001 TOYOTA TRUCK HAD HIS FRAME REPLACED, NO QUESTIONS ASKED, IN 2015.  I FIND THIS EXTREMELY TROUBLING BECAUSE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT COULD LEAD TO POTENTIALLY INJURING MYSELF AND MY FAMILY IF THE FRAME WERE TO FURTHER CRACK OR SPLIT.

I CALLED MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER  (PRIORITY  TOYOTA CHESAPEAKE, VA) THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THE CORROSION PROTECTION HAS EXPIRED AND THERE WAS NOTHING FURTHER THEY COULD DO.  WHILE ATTEMPTING TO GREASE MY PROPELLER SHAFT, I WAS ON MY CREAPER TRYING TO PULL MYSELF UNDER THE VEHICLE. I GRABBED PART OF THE FRAME, IN FRONT OF THE LEAF SPRING PERCH. WHILE GRABBING THIS SECTION OF FRAME AND PULLING MYSELF UNDER THE TRUCK, THE FRAME CRUMBLED IN TO MY HAND. THERE WERE A LOT OF RUST FLAKES, LARGE AND SMALL, I COLLECTED AS MUCH OF THE RUST AND FLAKES AS I COULD AND STORED THEM IN A ZIP LOCK BAG. THE SIZE OF THE DETERIORATION WAS ABOUT 7\" LONG AND PERFORATED ABOUT 9/16\" NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE C CHANNEL. I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE INTEGRITY  OF THE FRAME  ON THIS VEHICLE  PARTICULARLY  IN REGARDS TO BRAKING SYSTEM, FRAME CROSS MEMBERS AND SUSPENSION COMPONENTS. I CALLED TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE SOON AFTER TO REPORT WHAT HAPPENED. I TOLD THEM MY VIN AND OTHER INFORMATION. THEY SAID THEY WOULD CALL BACK IN 1 BUSINESS DAY. I RECEIVED A CALL FROM TOYOTA TODAY 10/27/16 AND A REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME THAT TOYOTA IS NO LONGER SUPPORTING MY VEHICLE FOR ANY CAMPAIGNS. I ASKED THE REPRESENTATIVE FOR FURTHER LITERATURE REGARDING THE FRAME CORROSION PROGRAMS FOR TUNDRAS, HOWEVER, TOYOTA WILL NOT LET ME HAVE THIS INFORMATION. AT THIS POINT TOYOTA WILL DO NOTHING TO HELP OR PROVIDE ASSISTANCE IN REPAIRING THEIR POORLY DESIGNED VEHICLE. PLEASE DO NOT BUY TOYOTAS BECAUSE IN THE FUTURE THERE WILL BE FAILURES AND TOYOTA WILL NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS.  PLAIN AND SIMPLE.  *TR",

TOYOTA'S RESPONSE IS TYPICAL OF WHAT OTHER OWNER'S ARE REPORTING ON VARIOUS WEB SITES INCLUDING \"TUNDRA SOLUTIONS\" AND OTHERS. THIS IS A SERIOUS DEFECT FOR WHICH TOYOTA SHOULD ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY. THIS FAILURE COULD HAVE LED TO A SERIOUS ACCIDENT HAD THERE BEEN A REAR END COLLISION OR HAD CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE BEEN LOST WHILE STEERING INTO A MUDDY MEDIAN WHERE ROAD CONSTRUCTION WAS IN PROGRESS.   *TR",

WHEN I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE BED OF THE TRUCK WOULD HAVE TO BE REMOVED TO COMPLETE THE REPAIRS. I TOLD THEM THAT I DID NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO REMOVE THE TONNEAU COVER AND THE BED RUG. THEY SAID THAT THEY COULD NOT PERFORM THE REPAIR WITHOUT THESE ITEMS REMOVED AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT REMOVE THEM FOR ME. I THEN CONTACTED TOYOTA CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE CENTER AT 800-331-4331, EXTENSION [XXX] AND DISCUSSED THE SITUATION WITH [XXX]. SHE CLAIMED THAT THE RECALL LETTER STATES THAT THE TRUCK MUST BE PRESENTED IN \"FACTORY CONDITION\" (I GUESS THAT MEANS NO BED RUG OR TONNEAU COVER). I REREAD THE LETTER AND THAT IS NOT STATED ANYWHERE IN THE LETTER. I CALLED HER BACK AND SHE WAS UNABLE TO ASSIST ME NOR WOULD SHE ELEVATE MY ISSUE TO THE MANAGEMENT LEVEL. THIS RECALL WORK MUST BE DONE, AND AGAIN, I HAVE NO MEANS TO REMOVE THESE ITEMS. I'M SURE THAT I'M NOT THE ONLY TUNDRA OWNER EXPERIENCING THIS ISSUE.

I LIVED IN FLORIDA FOR 6 MONTHS AND IN VERMONT THE OTHER 6 MONTHS. WE LEFT THE LATTER PART OF OCTOBER AND RETURN TO VT THE LAST PART OF APRIL OR EARLY MAY. I DO DRIVE THE TRUCK UP TO VT AROUND THE HOLIDAYS SO IT HAS EXPERIENCED A VT  WINTER FOR 2 TO 3 WEEKS A YEAR. SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE TRUCK STARTED TO SHOW SIGNS OF RUST ON THE BACK BUMPER AND THE UNDERSIDE. 2 YEARS AGO I HAD TO REPLACED ALL THE BOLTS ON THE EXHAUST SYSTEM REPLACED DUE TO RUST. DUE TO A FLAT TIRE THIS PAST SUMMER I HAD TO USE THE SPARE. THE TIRE RIM WAS EXTREMELY RUSTY AS WELL AS THE HOLDER. I SPRAYED BOTH WITH OIL IN HOPES OF STOPPING THE RUST.  THE FRONT SKID PLATE BOLTS WERE SO RUSTY THAT. YESTERDAY, THE DEALER HAD TO REPLACE 4 BOLTS SAYING THE 5TH HOLE WAS SO RUSTY THAT IT COULD NOT ACCEPT THE BOLT. THE RECALL IS FOR NORTHERN TRUCKS ARE FOR STATES THAT USE ROAD SALT DURING THE WINTER BUT, GIVEN THE RUST ON MY TRUCK, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT 2 TO 3 WEEKS PER YEAR IN VT CAUSED THAT MUCH RUST. I BELIEVE IT IS A PROBLEM WITH THE METAL USED FOR THE UNDERSIDE OF THE TRUCK, THEREFORE I BELIEVE MY FL TRUCK SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE RECENT RECALL. EVEN THE DEALER COMMENTED ON THE AMOUNT OF RUST ON THE UNDERSIDE. THIS TRUCK HAS BEEN USED ONLY FOR PLEASURE AND NOT COMMERCIAL USE. TO SUMMARIZE I WOULD REQUEST THAT MY TRUCK THAT WAS  PURCHASED IN FL BE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL AND BE SUBJECT TO THE INSPECTION THE SAME AS THE NORTHERN TRUCKS. ALTHOUGH WE LIVE A FEW MILES FROM THE GULF IN FLORIDA MY WIFE'S 2004 HIGHLANDER SHOWS NO UNDERSIDE RUST SO THE FLORIDA WEATHER CAN'T BE THE PROBLEM AND IT  IN VT  THE SAME TIME AS THE TRUCK EXCEPT FOR THE 2 TO 3 WEEKS AROUND THE HOLIDAYS.

I PURCHASED IT BRAND NEW AND WHEN I REACHED 15,000 MILES THE SHIFT COLUMN TO THE RIGHT OF THE STEERING WHEEL SNAPPED OFF IN MY HAND.  I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER THAT I BOUGHT IT AND IT TOOK THEM THREE WEEKS TO FIX BECAUSE THEY CLAIMED NOT TO HAVE A TOOL NEEDED TO REASSEMBLE THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE COLUMN.  AT APPROXIMATELY 39,000 MILES THE COLUMN AGAIN SNAPPED OFF DURING NORMAL OPERATION.  THIS TIME I TOOK IT TO ANOTHER TOYOTA DEALER BECAUSE I HAD NO CONFIDENCE IN THE ORIGINAL ONE THAT FIXED IT.  I HAD TO ARGUE WITH THE NEW DEALER OVER COVERING THE REPAIR UNDER WARRANTY WHICH THEY DID EVENTUALLY DO.  ONCE AGAIN THE SECOND DEALER HAD THE VEHICLE NEARLY 3 WEEKS AND ONCE AGAIN THEY CITED THE LACK OF THE APPROPRIATE TOOL TO REASSEMBLE THE COLUMN.  THEY ACTUALLY SAID THEY HAD TO FABRICATE A TOOL TO MAKE THE REPAIR.  AND FINALLY YESTERDAY, THE COLUMN HAS SNAPPED FOR A THIRD TIME.  I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS IS NOT OCCURRING IN A FIT OF RAGE, NOR AM I AGGRESSIVELY HANDLING THE SHIFT EACH TIME I ENGAGE THE TRUCK INTO DRIVE.  BOTH DEALERS CLAIM THAT THIS REPAIR IS UNHEARD OF AT THEIR DEALERSHIPS WHICH IS PROBABLY TRUE.  I WANTED TO REPORT IT TO YOU ALL IN CASE THERE WERE ADDITIONAL REPORTS COMING FROM OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTRY.  THANK YOU.    MARC A. LAPIERRE *TR",

I'D LIKE TO ALSO NOTE THAT MY LAST TRUCK WAS A T-100 WITH THE 3.4 V6 ENGINE - SO I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH HOW THIS ENGINE SHOULD, IN THEORY, RESPOND.  DEALER CLAIMS THIS A  COMPUTER ISSUE AND TOYOTA HAS NOT ISSUED A TSB. DEALER ALSO CLAIMS THAT THIS FEATURE WAS ADDED TO REDUCE JERKY FEELING WHEN SHIFTING GEARS.  THE ISSUE PRESENTS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. WHEN TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, IN AN EMERGENCY, YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOOSE 1.5 SECONDS OF BRAKING TIME.  ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS THE ADDED WEAR ON YOUR FRONT DISK BRAKE PADS DUE TO THE ENGINE TRYING TO MAINTAIN RPM WHILE BRAKES ARE TRYING TO STOP THE TRUCK.  THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN REPRODUCED AT THE DEALER.  TO CHECK A TRUCK, CRUISE AT 55 OR 65 MPH, NOTE THE RPM - THEN IF YOU HAVE TO BRAKE HARD TRY TO NOTE IF THE RPM DROPS IMMEDIATELY OR, HANGS UP FOR A SECOND OR TWO. ANOTHER WAY TO CHECK THIS IS, WHILE PARKED, RACE ENGINE TO 2500-3000 RPM THEN SWITCH FOOT FROM GAS TO BRAKE PEDAL QUICKLY-SIMULATING AN EMERGENCY STOP. NOTE THE RPM AND ENGINE SOUND. YOU WILL FIND THE ENGINE STILL MAINTAINING THAT 2500-3000 RPM FOR 1-1.5 SECONDS.  ALSO, DEALER POINTED OUT THAT UNLESS THERE ARE MORE COMPLAINTS, TOYOTA 'WILL NOT' DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.
