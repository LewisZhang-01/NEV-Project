THEY WERE MOUNTED, BALANCED AND INFLATED BY THE EMPLOYEES AT THE BIG O IN PEORIA AREA, WE THEN HIT THE 17 NORTH TOWARDS FLAGSTAFF. WITHIN 80 MILES THE TREAD RIPPED OFF OF THE TIRE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHILE DRIVING 55 MILES AN HOUR ON A MOUNTAINOUS HIGHWAY, THANKFULLY I DID NOT HIT ANYONE NOR CAUSED ANY ACCIDENT AS I FOUGHT TO CONTROL MY VEHICLE AND BRING IT TOO A STOP WITH A TRAILER IN TOW. WHEN I MADE IT TO FLAG, RATHER THAN RETURN TO PHOENIX TO TURN AND CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN AGAIN THE BIG O IN FLAGSTAFF CALLED THE LOCATION THAT WE GOT THE TIRE FROM AND AFTER MAKING US WAIT WELL OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF THEY DECIDED THAT THE TIRE WAS NOT GOING TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE WE DID NOT BUY THE WARRANTY, WHICH NEVER WAS OFFERED. THE TIRES TREAD IS INTACT AND NEW, THIS HAPPENED IN 80 MILES AND SHORTLY AFTER BUYING IT ON THE SAME DAY.",
