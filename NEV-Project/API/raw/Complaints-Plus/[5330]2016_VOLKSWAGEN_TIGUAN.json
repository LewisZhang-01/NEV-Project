I couldn\u2019t drive for days because water pumps are so expensive and my is more than 30 mile away which causes my car to over heat and the antifreeze was leaking so much I didn\u2019t want to get stranded out there so I didn\u2019t drive much until I was able to replace the water pumps. It\u2019s to my knowledge Volkswagens had water pumps defects issues and I feel Volkswagen needs to recall 2016 models because water pumps should last for over 100,000 miles or more. I brought this car used in good condition with only 34,000 on the car and now water pumps goes bad. I hope someone looks into this matter because this parts are very expensive on consumers and Volkswagen needs to pick up the bill not consumers..Thanks for your time.",

This is a safety issue.Due to reinstallation of a faulty part the clock spring continually breaks each year.VW & the dealership are aware that the part is faulty & this is why VW created an extended warranty on just the clock spring.When I stated this to the VW rep he stated that they cannot do anything about bad parts.Shame on VW",
