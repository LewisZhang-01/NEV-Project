THE LACK OF STABILITY CONTROL OCCURS WHEN DRIVING OVER SMALL UNEVEN SURFACES AND CAUSES THE STEERING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.   DEALER DIAGNOSIS:  I VISITED AN INFINITI DEALER ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS AND PRESENTED MY CONCERNS.    THE SERVICE DEPARTMENTS WERE NOT ABLE TO IDENTIFY OR RECTIFY MY CONCERNS.  ON DECEMBER 8, 2011 - SHEEHY'S INFINITI OF ANNAPOLIS, MD - MY VEHICLE ODOMETER READING WAS AT 23,539. ON MAY 2, 2013 - JBA'S INFINITI OF ELLICOTT CITY, MD - MY VEHICLE ODOMETER READING WAS AT 45,034. ON JANUARY 20, 2014 - SHEEHY'S INFINITI OF ANNAPOLIS, MD - MY VEHICLE ODOMETER READING WAS AT 55,430.  CUSTOMER COMMENTS:  SEVERAL OWNERS AND PREVIOUS OWNERS OF THE 2008-2010 QX56 (VIA RESEARCH) EXPERIENCED VERY SIMILAR SUSPENSION AND STEERING FLAWS.  IF THIS IS A FLAW IN THE DESIGN OF THE VEHICLE, I DO NOT FEEL THAT IT IS THE CONSUMERS FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY TO CORRECT IT, WHICH IS WHY I CONTACTED (VIA EMAIL) INFINITI'S CONSUMER AFFAIRS OFFICE ON JANUARY 24, 2010.  AFTER SPEAKING TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENTS AND REVIEWING MY VEHICLE HISTORY, [XXX] (FROM INFINITI CONSUMER AFFAIRS) CONTACTED ME ON JANUARY 31, 2014.  [XXX] RESPONSE WAS EXACTLY LIKE THE SERVICE DEPARTMENTS:  SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO IDENTIFY A PROBLEM.    MY WIFE NORMALLY DRIVES THIS VEHICLE, BUT IT BECAME OBVIOUS TO US THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG AROUND JULY OR AUGUST 2010.  THERE IS A SERIOUS FLAW IN THE MECHANICAL EQUIPMENT AND/OR DESIGN OF MY 2010 INFINITI QX56 4X4 SUV THAT SCARES THE HECK OUT OF MY WIFE AND KIDS WHEN DRIVING IT.  THIS VEHICLE IS NOT SAFE TO BE ON THE ROAD, BUT WE HAVE TO DRIVE IT BECAUSE IT IS OUR ONLY FAMILY MODE OF TRANSPORTATION.  I WOULD LIKE INFINITI TO CORRECT MY VEHICLE DEFICIENCIES OR REPLACE MY VEHICLE WITH ONE THAT IS SAFE TO DRIVE.
