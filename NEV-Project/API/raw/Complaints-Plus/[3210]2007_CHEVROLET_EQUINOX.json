IT DOES NOT MATTER IF THE VEHICLE IS PARKED ON A FLAT SERVICE OR ON AN INCLINE, THE KEY KEEPS GETTING STUCK IN THE IGNITION.  I HAVE EVEN TAKEN ALL OTHER KEYS OFF THE KEY RING THINKING THAT WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE, IT DID NOT.  THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN GET THE KEY OUT IS BY SHAKING THE SHIFTER ON THE FLOOR AND WOBBLE THE STEERING WHEEL BACK AND FORTH.  THAT DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK, SO SOMETIMES I HAVE TO TURN THE VEHICLE BACK ON AND OFF AGAIN TO GET IT TO COME OUT. I AM AFRAID THAT ONE OF THESE TIMES I AM NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THE KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION WHICH WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR SOMEONE TO BREAK INTO IT AND STEAL IT FROM ME.  I HAVE GONE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND TOLD ME THAT I WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE IGNITION CYLINDER AT MY OWN EXPENSE SINCE THERE IS NO OFFICIAL RECALL ON THE PART.  *TR",

THE STABILITY A LIGHT CAME ON,AT THE EXACT TIME THE LIGHTS CAME ON THE CAR WOULD  SLOW WAY, WAY DOWN  IT DIDN'T EVEN REGISTER ON HOW MANY MILES I WAS GOING THAT'S HOW  SLOW THE CAR MOVED, THEN IT CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP. I WAITED A FEW SECONDS AND TRIED TO START THE CAR AND IT DID START. THIS KEPT HAPPENING ABOUT 4 OR 5 TIMES, THEN ON DECEMBER 12, 20014 IT DID IT AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME IT WOULD NOT START UP AGAIN. I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED, I HAD ALL OF MY 10 YEAR OLD CHRISTMAS GIFTS STILL IN THE CAR. THE GARAGE HAD MY CAR FROM DEC. 12 THRU TO MARCH 20, 2015, THEN IT WAS TOWED TO ANOTHER GARAGE, THE FIRST GARAGE COULD NOT LOCATE THE PROBLEM. OK, THE SECOND GARAGE HAD IT, THEY CHARGED ME $160.00 I GOT THE CAR BACK ON  APRIL 10, 2015 I DROVE IT FOR FOUR DAYS AND IT DID IT AGAIN, NOW THIS CAR HAS DIED IN THE MIDDLE OF INTERSECTIONS BEFORE AND IT DID IT AGAIN ON APRIL 13 2015. I WAS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF A VERY BUSY INTERSECTION, THERE WAS THIS HUGE DUMP TRUCK HEADED RIGHT FOR ME, I WAS SCARED  TO DEATH, I ALMOST ALWAYS HAVE MY GRANDCHILDREN WITH ME THANK GOD THEY WEREN'T THIS TIME. WHEN MY CAR WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY THE STABILITRAC LIGHT DID NOT COME ON, AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES AFTER THE FACT THEY DID COME ON. TWO MEN PUSHED ME OUT FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION. THERE WAS SMOKE COMING FROM THE HOOD OF THE CAR. THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT OF IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE RADIATOR,  BUT COME TO FIND OUT IT WAS NOT THE RADIATOR. I HAD THE CAR TOWED AGAIN TO A DIFFERENT GARAGE, THEY LOOKED IT OVER VERY WELL AND CALLED ME TO TELL ME THERE'S A WIRE THAT CAUGHT ON FIRE AND IT BURNED.   *TR",

I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WERE NO RECALLS & THAT I SHOULD FILE WITH MY INSURANCE COMPANY.  I CONTACTED MY INSURANCE COMPANY & WAS TOLD NO COLLISION, NO CLAIM.  I THEN WENT BACK TO THE SERVICE MANAGER & HE PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THAT THE CAR PROBABLY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO TIP OVER--REALLY?  LONG STORY SHORT, I HAVE CALLED GM PRODUCT DEPARTMENT & FILED A CLAIM WITH THEM, AND THE DEALERSHIP HAS HAD MY CAR FOR OVER A WEEK, AND THEY HAVE NOT HEARD FROM GM.  I WAS TOLD BY THE PRODUCT SPECIALIST THAT AN INSPECTOR WAS GOING TO CHECK THE CAR & LET ME KNOW WHAT THE COMPUTER SAYS OF WHY THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYED.  I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING, AND THEY ARE SAYING IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME ESPECIALLY IN SUV'S.  I HAVE OWNED AN SUV SINCE 2005 & HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED AN ISSUE WITH THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYING WITHOUT A COLLISION.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ANY ONE ELSE & HOW I CAN HANDLE THIS MALFUNCTION OF THE AIR BAGS.  I FEEL THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE WITH FAULTY AIR BAGS, NOT MY FINANCIAL ISSUE.  AND IS THIS CAR STILL SAFE FOR US TO DRIVE?  PLEASE HELP.  *TR",

SO, I WAS LEFT WITH NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE BUT TO ATTEMPT TO FIX THE PROBLEM MYSELF.

INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL IN EFFECT FOR MY PROBLEM BUT THAT HIS STAFF WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO CHECK OUT MY PROBLEM AND FIX AND REPLACE ANY BROKEN AND OR DEFECTED PARTS BUT THEY WOULD ONLY DO SO IF AND WHEN I DELIVERED MY VEHICLE TO THEIR SHOP, ALSO AT MY EXPENSE.  A FEW MONTHS AFTER ALL THIS HAPPENED AND A FEW MONTHS AGO, GM SENT OUT A BROCHURE STATING THAT THERE WAS INDEED A RECALL REGARDING MY SPECIFIC PROBLEM AND THAT I SHOULD TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO GET MY VEHICLE TO THE GM DEALER (CLOSEST ONE FROM PONTOTOC BEING TUPELO - DEALERSHIP NAME WITHHELD) WHERE IT WOULD BE PROFESSIONALLY REPAIRED FREE OF ANY CHARGES TO ME.  IF THERE  INDEED IS OR EVER WAS A RECALL COVERING MY PROBLEM, SHOULDN'T THERE ALSO BE A REINSTATEMENT FEE ASSOCIATED WITH IT FOR VICTIMS THAT HAVE BEEN MISINFORMED OR WHO'S PROBLEM INITIATED BEFORE THE ACTUAL RECALL WENT INTO EFFECT OR IS THIS JUST ANOTHER WAY THE AUTO COMPANIES MAKE MORE MONEY OFF THE SAME INDIVIDUALS THAT PAID THE PRICE TO BAIL THEM OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE?

IN MY RESEARCH I DISCOVERED THAT OTHER OWNERS HAD: FUEL TANK LEAKING; FUEL PUMP AND FUEL SENSOR REPLACED; FUEL PRESSURE MODULAR; FAULTY FUEL LINES; CRACKED FUEL TANK; GAS TANK SEAM NEAR PUMP/SENDING UNIT ASSEMBLY SEPARATED & LEAKING; PLASTIC GAS TANK HAD A CRACK; VAPOR CANISTER; CRACKED FUEL PUMP PIPE; FUEL LINE FROM FUEL PUMP TO ENGINE CRACKED; FUEL PUMP MODULE AT CONNECTOR; AND ON AND ON AND ON!!!    THIS APPEARS TO BE A COMPONENT FAILURE/MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED.  THIS IS A SAFETY AND HEALTH ISSUE - THE POTENTIAL FOR ONE OF THESE VEHICLES EXPLODING (POSSIBLY WITH DEATHS) IS GREAT.

A LOUD RAPID NOISE WOULD SUDDENLY COME THROUGH THE LEFT SPEAKERS AS I WAS DRIVING AND WOULD CONTINUE UNTIL I USED THE TURN SIGNAL (EITHER DIRECTION). I HAD THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER NUMEROUS TIMES. FIRST I WAS TOLD THERE WAS AN INTERMITTENT SHORT IN THE RADIO, BUT THE RADIO REPLACEMENT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. THEN THE LEFT TWEETER SPEAKER WAS CHANGED, THE RADIO RECALIBRATED (THREE TIMES), THE RADIO SOFTWARE UPDATED, AND FINALLY THE BODY CONTROL MODULE CHANGED. NONE OF THESE THINGS FIXED THE PROBLEM. THE GM ENGINEER LOOKED AT IT TWICE AND STILL COULDN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I WAS TOLD NO OTHER GM PRODUCT IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AS MY VEHICLE. WHEN I WENT TO THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE DEALERSHIP AND TOLD HIM OF THE PROBLEM AND THAT THE VEHICLE WAS A LEMON, HE CONTACTED THE GM DISTRICT REP, WHO REFUSED TO REPLACE THE VEHICLE. I WAS FORCED TO TAKE GM TO ARBITRATION, AND NOW I AM GETTING MY MONEY BACK PLUS MY FILING FEE. THE PROBLEM IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIRS THE VALUE OF THE VEHICLE. I AM TURNING THE EQUINOX IN NEXT WEEK, TAKING MY MONEY AND BUYING A HONDA CR-V. I WOULD NOT ADVISE ANYONE TO BUY AN EQUINOX AFTER MY EXPERIENCE, AND ESPECIALLY GM'S ATTITUDE. IN FACT, I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER GM PRODUCT. IF YOU HAVE HAD YOUR EQUINOX TO THE DEALER AT LEAST 4 TIMES FOR THE SAME PROBLEM AND ARE STILL GETTING THE RUN AROUND AND NO RESOLUTION, FIRST WRITE TO THE CHEVY CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CENTER FOR HELP IN REPAIRING THE VEHICLE. YOU WILL NEED TO DO THIS IN ORDER TO REQUEST A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE OR A REPURCHASE. SECOND, DON'T LET GM KEEP STRINGING YOU ALONG. FILE FOR ARBITRATION UNDER YOUR STATE'S LEMON LAW PROGRAM. IT'LL COME TO THAT ANYWAY. PLEASE, READ THE REVIEWS AND THE AUTO BLOGS ABOUT THIS VEHICLE ON LINE. EVEN THE NEWEST MODELS RATE POORLY. *TR",
