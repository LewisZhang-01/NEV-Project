WELL I GOT IT HOME AND DROVE FOR A FEW DAYS AND NOTICED WHEN I WOULD TAKE IT OUT OF PARK IT WOULD ,AKE A LOUD THUMP NOISE ONLY SOMETIMES LIKE I AM SITTING ON A HILL. I TOOK IT BACK THEY HEARD THE NOISE SAID THEY COULD FIX IT BUT SERVICE SAID THAT WAS NORMAL, WHICH I STRONGLY DISAGREED BUT MY DEAL WAS FUNDED AND NOTHING THEY WOULD DO. SO ANOTHER MONTH OR SO LATER I NOTICE MY GAS TO EMPTY WAS JUMPING DRASTICALLY I FIGURED BAD GAS SO I DROVE IT OUT AND TRIED AGAIN AND AGAIN. FINALLY HAD IT BECAUSE GOING FROM 60 TO 30 IN 2 MILES IS MAJOR THAT SAME WEEK I USED MY CRUISE CONTROL FOR MAYBE THE 3RD TIME SINCE I HAD THE VEHICLE AND IT WOULD NOT KEEP A STEADY SPEED I WENT UP 5 MPH FASTER THAN I SET IT AND THEN DROPPED IT DID THIS UNTIL I CANCELLED THE CRUISE. I IMMEDIATELY MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALER THEY HAVE HAD IT A WEEK AND NO WORD FROM THEM YET. MEANWHILE I HAVE RESEARCHED AND SEE THE SAME ISSUES I AM HAVING LEAD TO MORE ISSUES LIKE THE BRAKES NOT STOPPING THE VEHICLE AND I TRAVEL 100 MILES BACK AND FORTH TO WORK AND HAVE SMALL CHILDREN THAT IS A VERY UNEASY FEELING. THE OTHER ISSUES LIKE THE RADIO FREEZING INBETWEEN CHANGING FROM BLUE-TOOTH TO RADIO SO I HAVE TO DRIVE THAT ENTIRE HOUR TRIP TO WORK WITHOUT ANY MUSIC UNLESS I STOP AND RESTART THE CAR. ALSO WHEN I GET OFF THE HIGHWAY A LOT OF TIMES THE SENSOR FOR THE SPEED AND RADIO FINALLY KICKS IN AND THE RADIO PLAYS EXTREMELY LOUD LIKE I AM STILL ON THE HIGHWAY AND THE ENTIRE RIDE THE RADIO WOULD NOT TURN UP PASS THE LOW VOLUME.",
