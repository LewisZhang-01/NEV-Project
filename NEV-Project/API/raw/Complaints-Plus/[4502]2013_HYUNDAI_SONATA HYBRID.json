SHE CALLED ME AGAIN & I TOLD HER TO CALL HYUNDAI ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO ABRA IN BISMARCK, ND. THEY REPAIRED THE VEHICLE.  THE COST WAS $9760.00. THEY WERE IN THE PROCESS OF MOVING IT FROM THE REPAIR SHOP TO THE PAINT SHOP, WHICH WAS RIGHT NEXT DOOR. THEY TURNED ON THE ENGINE & AS IT WAS SITTING THERE, IT STARTED SPEWING RADIATOR FLUID. THEY TURNED IT OFF AND TOOK THE CAR TO HYUNDAI OF BISMARCK. THEY DETERMINED THAT THE HEADS WERE WARPED AND THE ENGINE WAS DESTROYED. AFTER THE COST OF THE NEW ENGINE WAS ADDED TO THE COST OF REPAIRS, THE CAR WAS TOTALED.        I DON'T THINK THAT IF A PERSON PULLS OVER WITHIN A MINUTE OF THE OVERHEATING LIGHT COMING ON. THAT IT WILL WARP THE HEADS.  THE WHOLE REASON FOR THE LIGHT IS TO WARN THE DRIVER..

FIRST: THE PROBLEM IS THE CAR SOMETIMES GOES ABOUT 3 MPH FOR APPROXIMATELY 25 FEET BEFORE LURCHING WITH GREAT ACCELERATION. I DROVE WITH THE 'ENERGY FLOW' MODE ON THE DISPLAY TO SEE WHAT WAS SHOWING WHEN THIS PROBLEM WAS OCCURRING. ACCORDING TO THE OWNER'S MANUAL THE DISPLAY WAS SHOWING THE \"ENGINE GENERATION/MOTOR DRIVE\" (TO DECELERATE THE VEHICLE, ENGINE BRAKING IS USED WHILE THE REGENERATIVE BRAKING IS APPLIED AND ALSO CHARGES THE HYBRID BATTERY. [ENGINE>BATTERY>WHEEL]). THIS SOUNDS LIKE A DECELERATION MODE, BUT SHOULD THIS BE HAPPENING WHEN MY FOOT IS PRESSING THE GAS PEDAL? IT HAS OCCURRED WHEN I HAVE SLOWED TO MAKE A LEFT TURN AND ALSO WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A DEAD STOP. IT HAPPENS WHEN I AM APPLYING STEADY PRESSURE OR PUMPING THE PEDAL. THIS CAN BE A HUGE POTENTIAL PROBLEM/ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN IF I AM ATTEMPTING TO TURN OR CROSS A ROAD WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC BECAUSE I MAY NOT BE MOVING FAST ENOUGH TO CROSS BEFORE THE TRAFFIC GETS TO ME. EVEN IF THEY WERE OVER A HUNDRED FEET AWAY WHEN I STARTED THE TURN/TO CROSS THE INTERSECTION. SECOND: AS HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BY OTHERS, THERE IS A 'THUMP' FELT AT TIMES WHILE BRAKING. IT IS FELT IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND THROUGH THE BRAKE PEDAL AND ALSO FELT BY THE PASSENGER'S THROUGH THEIR SEATS. THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE IT WOULD BE THE FEELING OF BEING REAR-ENDED AND PUSHED FORWARD SEVERAL INCHES. AS DRIVER, MY HEAD IS USUALLY AN INCH OR TWO AWAY FROM THE HEAD REST AND WHEN THIS HAPPENS MY HEAD HITS THE HEADREST OR THE HEADREST HITS MY HEAD. THE BRAKE PEDAL ITSELF IS NOT AFFECTED, AS THERE IS NO FEELING OF LOSING THE BRAKE/NOT SLOWING DOWN. IT'S JUST A 'THUMP' FELT.",
