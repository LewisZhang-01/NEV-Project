I PULLED OVER AND THE DEALER TOLD ME TO SLOWLY DRIVE THE CAR BACK.  I TRIED, BUT NEVER MADE IT.  THE CLOSER I GOT, THE WORSE THE CAR BUCKED AND THE RPM'S RACED.  I FINALLY TOOK MY FOOT OFF OF THE BRAKE AS I DECIDED WHETHER TO CONTINUE ON OR PULL OVER, BUT BEFORE I COULD DECIDE, MY CAR BEGAN ACCELERATING ON IT'S OWN.  I QUICKLY GOT THE CAR OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE EXPRESSWAY AND INTO THE GRASS.  THE RPM'S STILL ERRATIC AND THE CAR IDLED AT 2.5-3 RPM'S.  THIS CAR IS A DEATH TRAP AND IS NOT SAFE.  DEALERSHIP STILL CAN NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT.*AK",
