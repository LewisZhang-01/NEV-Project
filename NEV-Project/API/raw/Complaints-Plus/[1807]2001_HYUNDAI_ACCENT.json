I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY BUT THE PART IS RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE FOR ANYONE TO AFFORD TO PAY ANOTHER $3K TO FIX IT.  I FEEL TO POINT THAT I RATHER SAVE MY $3K RIGHT NOW AND BUY A USE ACCORD/CAMRY TO DRIVE.  I AM WRITING THIS COMPLAINT HERE IS TO ASK NHTSA TO HELP ME VERIFY THE CONDITION OF THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL/REAR AXLE ON MY 2001 HYUNDAI SANTA FE LX AWD TO SEE IF THE PART SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER BUMPER TO BUMPER OR UNDER POWER TRAIN.  AS YOU CAN SEE YOUR PART SELECTION IS ALSO STATED POWER TRAIN: REAR DIFFERENTIAL UNIT. I WAS HOPING FOR A RECALL THEN THAT WOULD BE GREAT OR CHECK AT THE PRICE POINT OF THE PART.  IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE ($2400) JUST THIS PART ALONE.     *NM",

THEY TOLD ME THE SPARE ALREADY HAD A PLUG FROM A HOLE IN IT AND THAT THEY REPLACED THAT PLUG AND FILLED THE TIRE UP PROPERLY.

THE GENERAL MANAGER CALLED ME AND AFTER DISCUSSING THE MATTER HAD HIS STAFF TAKE MY CAR TO LES SCHWAB TO PUT A NEW SPARE TIRE IN THE CAR.
