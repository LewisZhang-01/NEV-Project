Previously I owned a 2008 Chevrolet Suburban with the same recall on it.  I was told that no parts were available for the repair.  I repeat this is a SAFETY recall!!!  We had a wreck in the 2008 chevrolet suburban which deployed the airbags.  Lucky for us the airbag worked properly.  My wife was setting in the front passenger seat.  If the igniter had exploded she would have been seriously injured or killed.  We bought this Yukon from Carmax.  The car came to us from  Alabama.  Hot and high humidity.  As I understand it these are the conditions that make the igniter more likely to explode.  Please do something on this recall.",
