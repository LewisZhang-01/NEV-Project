IT WOULD PULL VERY HARD TO THE RIGHT, MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO STEER, CAUSING CONSTANT ADJUSTMENTS WITH THE STEERING WHEEL, TO KEEP IT FROM RUNNING OFF OF THE ROAD. WE TOOK IT TO OUR BMW DEALER FOR REPAIR. THE VEHICLE WAS STILL UNDER MANUFACTURERS WARRANTY. WE WERE CHARGED $1773.14 TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE. THE UPPER CONTROL ARMS WERE BENT, ACCORDING TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT.THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TOLD US THAT IT WAS NOT A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT AND THAT WE MUST HAVE HIT A \"POTHOLE\", WHICH WE HADN'T. WE LIVE IN AN URBAN AREA WITH WELL MAINTAINED ROADS. I WAS ALSO NOT CLEAR ON HOW HITTING A POTHOLE, PRESUMABLY WITH ONE WHEEL, COULD BEND BOTH CONTROL ARMS. I SPOKE WITH AN INSURANCE ADJUSTER, TO SEE IF THE \"DAMAGE\" MIGHT BE AN INSURANCE CLAIM. I WAS TOLD \"NO\". THE ADJUSTER ALSO TOLD ME THAT HE HAD OWNED SEVERAL BMW'S HIMSELF, AND THEY WERE KNOWN TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE UPPER CONTROL ARMS. HE STATED THAT MY VEHICLE'S UPPER CONTROL ARMS, HAVE 3 DIFFERENT PART NUMBERS, AS THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM THEY CAN'T SEEM TO FIX. BY MARCH OF 2014 THE VEHICLE AGAIN STARTED TO PULL TO THE RIGHT. I TOOK IT BACK TO BMW TO HAVE IT RE-ALIGNED AND THEY ADVISED THAT MY TIRES, WERE TO WORN TO DO THE ADJUSTMENT. ON APRIL 19 2014 WE TRADED THE VEHICLE, AS WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT FUTURE PROBLEMS.  I REQUESTED AND SAVED THE UPPER CONTROL ARMS, AND VISUAL INSPECTION SHOWS NO DEFINITIVE BENT PARTS TO THE NAKED EYE. I BELIEVE THAT BMW HAS A SAFETY CONCERN WITH THOSE UPPER CONTROL ARMS, THAT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED. I CHECKED A FEW BMW BLOGS ONLINE, AND IT SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM. I WILL GIVE MY CONTROL ARMS TO YOUR AGENCY FOR INVESTIGATIVE PURPOSES IF YOU DESIRE.

AT THE TIME OF REPAIR OF THE ABOVE FLAT, MY MECHANIC INFORMED ME THAT THE PASSENGER-SIDE FRONT TIRE ALSO HAD A BUBBLED SIDEWALL NECESSITATING REPLACEMENT OF THAT TIRE IN ORDER TO PASS MY STATE VEHICLE INSPECTION.    SINCE THE REPAIR IN LATE MARCH 2012, I NOTICED THAT THE PASSENGER-SIDE FRONT TIRE HAS A BUBBLED SIDEWALL. I MIGHT ADD THAT NO POTHOLES HAVE BEEN HIT, DO ROAD DEBRIS HAS BEEN STRUCK.

THE RUN FLATS DO NOT BURST, BUT BUBBLE APPEAR ON THE SIDE AND EVENTUALLY THEY DEFLATE. AFTER THAT HAPPENS THEY ARE INOPERABLE UNLESS YOU DRIVE BELOW 30 MILES AN HOUR. HENCE I HAVE REPLACED FOUR TIRES SO FAR AT A COST OF NEARLY $2000. (RECEIPTS AVAILABLE). I HAVE SPOKEN TO BMW NORTH AMERICA,WHO INSTALLS THESE TIRES, AFTER MUCH HAGGLING THEY FINALLY AGREED TO REIMBURSE ME FOR HALF MY COST. HOWEVER I AM REALLY NERVOUS DRIVING THE CAR NOW, AS THE SLIGHTEST IMPERFECTION ON ROAD SURFACE CREATES A MAJOR TIRE PROBLEM.THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS TO BMW (SEE WEBSITE 'BIMMERFEST' (A BMW ENTHUSIAST WEBSITE). THEY KNOW THEY HAVE A PROBLEM BUT ARE TRYING  TO DEAL WITH ON A ONE BY ONE BASIS. BECAUSE THE CAR COMES WITH RUN FLAT TIRES ONLY, THERE IS NO SPARE TIRE. HENCE IF YOU REPLACE WITH REGULAR TIRE, YOU HAVE NO BACKUP IF YOU GET INTO TROUBLE. I AM HOPING THAT YOU WOULD INVESTIGATE AND HOPEFULLY PERSUADE BMW TO RECALL THESE TIRES AND REPLACE WITH BETTER TIRES. WHEN I SPEAK WITH BMW OF NORTH AMERICA THEY RESPOND AND SAY THAT THESE ARE GOODYEAR TIRES, AND NOT MANUFACTURED BY BMW HENCE THEY TRY AND TRANSFER THE BLAME TO GOODYEAR. BMW SOLD THIS VEHICLE WITH THESE TIRES, THEY CHOSE THEM. I SUSPECT TO SAFE MONEY ON PUTTING A SPARE OR DONUT WHEEL IN THE CAR. IN MY MIND THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE.

I PUSHED THE GAS PEDAL AND THERE WAS NO RESPONSE AND STEERING LOCKED UP. THE CAR WAS PUSHED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THEN TOWED TO THE BMW DEALERSHIP. INITIAL ANALYSIS FROM THE BMW DEALERSHIP WAS THAT THE ERROR RECORDED (FAULT STORED FOR VALVETRONIC SYSTEM. DEVIATION TOO GREAT. FREQUENCY 1 LOGISTICS 38.) DID NOT POINT TO A SPECIFIC COMPONENT FAILURE. THE ERROR DID INDICATE THAT A CERTAIN SOFTWARE LEVEL SHOULD BE LOADED IN THE CAR, BUT THE BMW DEALERSHIP SAID I ALREADY HAD THE CORRECT SOFTWARE LEVEL LOADED.  THEY RELOADED THE SOFTWARE LEVEL ANYWAY. THE BMW  DEALERSHIP KEPT THE CAR FOR A FEW DAYS OF TESTING AND DRIVING, BUT COULD NOT RECREATE THE PROBLEM. AFTER 3 DAYS, THE BMW DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THEY NOTICED THAT I ACTUALLY DID NOT ORIGINALLY HAVE THE LATEST SOFTWARE PATCH LEVEL INSTALLED IN MY CAR. SO, THE ONLY FIX PROVIDED BY BMW FOR MY ENGINE MALFUNCTION AND SHUTDOWN WAS LOADING A NEW SOFTWARE PATCH LEVEL (PROGRAM I LEVEL NEW F010-10-06-512), THE PREVIOUS SOFTWARE LEVEL LOADED IN MY CAR AT THE PLANT WAS PROGRAM I LEVEL PLANT F010-10-06-511. IT SHOULD BE NOTED, WHILE THE CAR WAS AT THE BMW DEALERSHIP, THEY DID INSTALL THE FIX FOR THE FUEL TANK SENSOR RECALL (BULLETIN 121410).

STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION, WITH \"FUEL PUMP MALFUNCTION\", AND \"ENGINE MALFUNCTION\" ON THE ONBOARD DASH.  I HIT MY HEAD ON THE STEERING WHEEL WHEN THIS OCCURRED.  I WAS ALSO CARRYING A 5 GALLON SQUARE CONTAINER OF WATER THAT WAS CAPPED AND SEALED IN THE TRUNK.  DURING THE ABRUPT STOP OF THE CAR, ABOUT 1/2 A GALLON OF WATER SPILLED INTO THE TRUNK.  AFTER BEING TOWED TO SHELLY BMW AND TALKING TO THEM THE NEXT DAY, THEY SAID IT WAS MY FAULT AND THAT THE WATER SHORTED OUT THE COMPONENTS IN THE TRUNK.  #1.  THE WATER SPILLED INTO THE TRUNK AFTER THE CAR ABRUPTLY STOPPED.  #2.  I WAS ALMOST REAR-ENDED BY THE CARS BEHIND ME WHEN THE CAR WENT FROM 30MPH TO 0MPH.  THE CAR DID NOT STALL AND SLOWLY COME TO A STOP....IT BASICALLY LOCKED UP AND STOPPED....CAUSING ME TO HIT MY HEAD ON THE STEERING WHEEL.  SHELLY BMW IS NOW TELLING ME THAT I HAVE TO PAY $2600 TO REPAIR/REPLACE THE MODULES THAT ARE DAMAGED.  #3.  THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED ON JULY 26, 2010.  #4.  IRVINE POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SITE TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS NOT HIT FROM OTHER CARS AS I SAT IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION FOR 1.5 HOURS WAITING FOR A TOW TRUCK.  I AM CONSIDERING SEEKING LEGAL ADVICE.  THIS ISSUE IS ALSO FILED WITH BMW NORTH AMERICA IN WHICH I AM STILL WAITING FOR THEM TO CONTACT ME. *TR",
