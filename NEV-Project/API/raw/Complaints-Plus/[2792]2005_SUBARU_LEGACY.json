ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF FROM HOME I NOTICED THAT THE ENGINE WAS REVVING ABNORMALLY HIGH TO MAINTAIN SPEED. I CALLED THE SHOP BACK IN BEND (THOMAS SALES AND SERVICE) AND THEY RECOMMENDED THAT I HAVE THE CAR TOWED BACK TO THEM. WHEN WE ARRIVED BACK IN BEND THE TECH AT THE DEALER INSPECTED THE CAR AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS A TURBO ISSUE, AS I HAD SUSPECTED. THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE DEALER WHO INFORMED ME THE ISSUE WOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. PARTS WERE ORDERED AND SERVICE WAS SCHEDULED. SEVERAL DAYS LATER I WAS CONTACTED AGAIN BY THE SERVICE MANAGER WHO INFORMED ME THAT SINCE MY CAR WAS AT 74K MILES (BUT STILL INSIDE THE 5 YEAR WARRANTY PERIOD) IT WOULD NOT BE COVERED AND THAT THE REPAIR COSTS WOULD BE RIGHT AROUND $2000. NATURALLY I WAS UPSET WITH THIS NEWS. I AM A MEMBER OF THE WEBSITE LEGACYGT.COM AND STARTED LOOKING AROUND FOR INFORMATION REGARDING MY PROBLEM AND FOUND A SERVICE BULLETIN REGARDING THE BANJO BOLT SCREEN IN THE TURBO GETTING CLOGGED. AT NO TIME WAS I EVER CONTACTED BY SUBARU OR MY DEALER REGARDING THIS POTENTIAL PROBLEM OR I WOULD HAVE HAD IT CHECKED OUT. I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF MYSUBARU.COM AND WAS NOT INFORMED THERE EITHER. I HAVE HAD REGULAR OIL CHANGES PERFORMED AND HAVE PERFORMED SEVERAL MYSELF  (I HAVE NO RECORD OF THIS IN THE FORM OF RECEIPTS, SEE ATTACHED COPIES) AND THE NIGHT BEFORE WE LEFT FOR BOISE I CHECKED ALL THE FLUIDS AND THE AIR PRESSURE IN THE TIRES AND FOUND EVERYTHING WAS GOOD. I WAS PLANNING ON HAVING THE OIL CHANGED AGAIN IN BOISE. I HAVE ALWAYS USED HIGH QUALITY SYNTHETIC OIL SINCE AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE OF CHANGES.

WHEN THE CLUTCH SLIPS, IT CAUSES A VERY ACRID SMELL, LIKE SOMETHING IS BURNING.  THIS ISSUE ALSO OCCURS WHEN IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC.  3)  CLUTCH SQUEAK:  WHEN PRESSING ON THE CLUTCH, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE CAR HAS BEEN DRIVEN FOR 5-10 MINUTES, THE CLUTCH WILL BEGIN TO SQUEAK, AND CAUSE REVERBERATIONS THAT CAN BE FELT ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AS WELL.  THE CAR WAS BROUGHT INTO THE DEALER WHO VERIFIED THE ISSUE.  THE ENTIRE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY WAS REPLACED WITHOUT FIXING THE ISSUE.  THEN THE CLUTCH SPRING WAS REPLACED, AND THAT MADE THE SQUEAK GO AWAY FOR A WHILE, BUT HAS SINCE RETURNED.  4)  WEAK WINDSHIELD:  OVER THE COURSE OF NORMAL DRIVING ON HIGHWAYS, THE WINDSHIELD HAS RECEIVED NUMEROUS SMALL CHIPS FROM DEBRIS.  SEVERAL OF THESE HAVE CAUSED CRACKS THAT HAVE HAD TO BE FILLED IN.  *JB",
