I STARTED TO BRAKE AS THIS WAS DOWNHILL AND A VERY LARGE TRUCK AND I DID NOT WISH TO INCREASE SPEED AS I FOLLOWED THE CURVE. MY BRAKES DID NOT RESPOND AND SANK TO THE FLOOR WITH NO RESISTANCE. I HAD NO STEERING ABILITY EITHER. I ENDED UP IN A HEAD-ON COLLISION WITH A VERY LARGE TREE AND THE AIRBAGS FAILED. I SPLIT MY HEAD OPEN ON THE STEERING WHEEL DESPITE BLOCKING MY FACE WITH MY FOREARMS CROSSED;  A DE-GLOVING 10-12 INCH LACERATION DOWN TO THE SKULL THAT WRAPS FROM MY NOSE BRIDGE AROUND TO MY RIGHT EAR IN THE CIRCULAR SHAPE OF THE STEERING WHEEL. MY RIGHT LEG WAS PINNED INTO THE CENTER DASH AREA AS THE ENGINE BLOCK AND STEERING COLUMN WERE SHOVED INTO THE CAB. I HAD TO BE REMOVED FROM MY VEHICLE WITH THE JAWS OF LIFE BY EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS. I AM LUCKY TO BE ALIVE. MY QUADRASTEER WAS DECLARED TOTALED BY USAA INSURANCE AND DESTROYED WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE. I CALLED USAA 3 DAYS AFTER THE CRASH AFTER FINDING SO MANY BRAKE FAILURES ON THIS VEHICLE/YEAR MODEL AND WAS TOLD IT WAS ALREADY DESTROYED, SO DOING AN INVESTIGATION WAS NOT POSSIBLE.   I HAVE LIVED IN PAIN AND ALSO PARALYZING FEAR OF DRIVING SINCE THEN; 3 YEARS. I AM A DISABLED MILITARY VETERAN WITH PTSD AND PRIOR BRAIN SURGERY AND THIS ACCIDENT CAUSED TO ME ISOLATE SO SEVERELY I COULD NOT EVEN ATTEND MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS DUE TO MY NEW FEARS OF DRIVING & RIDING IN VEHICLES. MY LIFE IS NOW RUINED BY THIS ACCIDENT. DECREASING VA DISABILITY DUE TO INABILITY TO ATTEND APPOINTMENTS CAUSED A $1000.00 PER MONTH LOSS OF BENEFITS. I CAN'T AFFORD MY BILLS AND HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THE VA TO GAIN ACCESS TO MEDICAL EVALUATIONS SINCE THEY ARE NOW STRIVING TO CUT BENEFITS FROM ANYONE THEY CAN. PLEASE RECALL NOW!!!!!

THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT BRAKING ACTION.  FORTUNATELY SHE WAS ABLE TO STOP SAFELY AND WAS NOT INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT. UPON EXAMINATION, THE BRAKE LINE TO THE LEFT REAR WHEEL WAS COMPLETELY RUSTED THROUGH. I EXAMINED THE REST OF THE LINES AND NOTICED THAT THE BRAKE LINES, THE TRANSMISSION COOLER LINE AND THE FUEL LINE ALL SHOW SIGNS OF MAJOR CORROSION, ESPECIALLY ALONG THE FRAME.   I HAVE LESS THAN 43,000 MILES ON THIS TRUCK AND IT WAS GARAGE-KEPT THE FIRST NINE YEARS I OWNED IT. I LIVE IN KY WHERE THE ROADS ARE ONLY SALTED A FEW TIMES A YEAR. THE REST OF THE VEHICLE IS RELATIVELY RUST FREE. THE TRUCK IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE NOW. EVEN IF I PATCH THE LEAK, THE REST OF THE LINES COULD FAIL AT ANY TIME. I COULD SUFFER CATASTROPHIC BRAKE FAILURE WHILE TOWING MY BOAT OR HORSE TRAILER OR SIMPLY GOING DOWN A HILL. FURTHERMORE, THE FUEL LINES ARE UNDER CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE AND IF THEY RUPTURE, THERE COULD BE A VERY DANGEROUS FIRE HAZARD. IF THE TRANSMISSION COOLER LINES RUPTURE, I COULD HAVE A COMPLETE TRANSMISSION FAILURE.

MY GMC AND APPARENTLY OTHERS HAVE THE SAME ISSUE - THAT EVEN WHEN A LINE BLOWS THE TRUCKS WILL NOT STOP! THE DUAL MASTER DOES NOT DO WHAT IT IS DESIGNED TO DO! THIS COUPLED WITH THE FACT THAT I ALSO HAVE BEEN PLAGUED WITH ABS LOW SPEED PROBLEMS SINCE 60K I REALLY FEEL THAT GM ENGINEERS AND BEAN COUNTERS NEED TO AGREE ON SAFETY. CONSIDERING THAT BRAKE LINES OF THIRTY YEARS AGO ARE BETTER THAN LATE MODEL PRODUCTS WOULD IT REALLY BE THAT MUCH FOR THE FEDS TO REQUIRE STAINLESS STEEL BRAKE LINES?

MY VEHICLES ARE ALWAYS DEALER MAINTAINED AT A GM DEALER. I HAVE HAD NO TROUBLES WITH MY TRUCK UNTIL NOW, AND THIS BRAKE FAILURE COULD HAVE KILLED ME AND MY FAMILY.  MY TRUCK WAS INSPECTED APRIL 13TH 2012 LAST AND HAD NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF UNSAFE BRAKE LINES. I HAD ONLY PUT 326 MILES ON MY TRUCK SINCE SAID LAST INSPECTION.  I WAS ON MY WAY HOME WHEN I HAD TO STOP AT A RED LIGHT.  I WAS TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 50 MPH WHEN I WENT TO APPLY THE BRAKES. MY BRAKE PETAL WENT TO THE FLOOR. LUCKILY THERE WERE NO CARS IN FRONT OF ME AS I HELD THE HORN AND DROVE THROUGH A RED LIGHT.  I WAS ALSO LUCKY THAT OTHERS DRIVERS IN THE INTERSECTION HAD NOT STARTED DRIVING.  MY EMERGENCY BRAKE THEN FAILED FROM THE HIGH SPEED I WAS TRAVELING, BUT DID HELP MINIMALLY IN THE SLOWING OF MY TRUCK. I WAS ABLE TO STOP BY DOWNSHIFTING AND DRIVING UP AN EMBANKMENT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. AS MY TRUCK TRAVELED UPHILL AND CAME TO A SLOWER SPEED, I WAS ABLE TO THEN PUT THE VEHICLE IN PARK WHICH THEN GOT ME TO A COMPLETE STOP.  I DECIDED TO FILE THIS COMPLAINT AFTER LEARNING THAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE EXACT SAME TRUCK AS ME HAVE HAD THIS EXACT ISSUE.  I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE THAT A VEHICLE THAT IS ONLY 10 YEARS OLD HAS BREAK LINE FAILURE. IT IS UNHEARD OF AND MUST BE DIRECTLY CAUSED FROM GM USING INFERIOR METAL FOR THESE VEHICLES BRAKE LINES, THEREFORE MAKING THEM RESPONSIBLE TO FIX THIS PROBLEM AND STAND BY THE VEHICLES THEY HAVE MADE!  NOT ONLY COULD I HAVE DIED FROM GMS FAULTY MANUFACTURING, BUT I COULD HAVE INJURED OTHERS.  GM NEEDS TO STAND UP AND DEAL WITH THESE PROBLEMS AND HELP OWNERS WITH THESE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE REPAIRS.  I WAS QUOTED OVER 2000 DOLLARS FROM MY DEALERSHIP TO FIX MY BRAKE LINE FAILURE.  WE NEED HELP GM!  *TR",

THE FAILURE OCCURRED ONE BRAKE APPLICATION AFTER EXITING THE OFF-RAMP OF A HIGHWAY; I WAS VERY FORTUNATE THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED AT LOW SPEED (APPROX. 15MPH) WHILE ENTERING A PARKING LOT.     THERE WAS NO COLLATERAL DAMAGE OR INJURIES INVOLVED.     FURTHER INSPECTION BY THE GM DEALER REVELED THAT ALL OF THE ASSOCIATED BRAKE LINES WERE HEAVILY CORRODED AND PRONE TO FAILURE AT SOME POINT IN THE NEAR TERM.     THE GM DEALER OFFERED TO REPAIR THE ONE BRAKE LINE THAT HAD FAILED FOR $600.00 AND INDICATED TO ME THAT REPLACING ALL NECESSARY BRAKE LINES WOULD BE COST PROHIBITIVE.     I ELECTED NOT TO HAVE GM REPAIR MY VEHICLE; SINCE THE COST FOR REPLACING ONE BRAKE LINE @ $600.00 IS RIDICULOUS!  FURTHER, REPLACING THE FAILED BRAKE LINE ONLY WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME SINCE THE ASSOCIATED BRAKE LINES ARE CLOSE TO FAILING AS WELL.     I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL REPUTABLE AUTO REPAIR FACILITY, WHO OFFERED A MUCH MORE REASONABLE QUOTATION AND WHO PERFORMED A COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION/REPAIR OF MULTIPLE SUSPECT BRAKE LINES IN ORDER TO MAKE THE VEHICLE TRULY SAFE.     I AM NOT HAPPY WITH GM DUE TO THEIR NON-RESPONSIVENESS OF THIS VERY SERIOUS MECHANICAL PROBLEM AND ASSOCIATED RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY.     I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLE FOR BRAKE LINES TO FAIL DUE TO CORROSION WITHIN THE FIRST TEN YEARS OF OPERATION; ESPECIALLY, FOR A VEHICLE WITH ONLY 54K MILES.     THIS IS TRULY A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED, HOWEVER, I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE THAT GM WILL ACT WITHOUT FEDERAL INTERVENTION.     DISAPPOINTED IN GM -   *TR",

THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM IS CORROSION AT THE ABS WHEEL SENSOR WHICH CAUSES THE ABS BRAKING SYSTEM TO ACTIVATE AT LOW SPEEDS WHEN STOPPING WHICH IN TURN INCREASES THE STOPPING DISTANCE.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT CANNOT BE NEGLECTED.  I HAD GONE TO THE BOB ROSS BUICK/GMC DEALERSHIP IN CENTERVILLE, OH ON 4/30/2009 ' ORIGINAL DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE TRUCK. THEY PERFORMED AN INSPECTION FOR $64.95 PLUS TAX AND 10% SHOP SUPPLIES CHARGE. THEY TOLD ME THAT SINCE THE TRUCK WAS ALREADY SERVICED FOR THE RECALL, THAT I AM NOT COVERED TO RE-REPAIR/REWORK THE TRUCK FOR THE RECURRENCE OF THE PROBLEM.  I CONTACTED GM CUSTOMER CARE AND WORKED WITH A REPRESENTATIVE NAMED AL AND THEN AFTER HE SAID HE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR ME FROM GM CORPORATE I WAS CONNECTED TO GM DISTRICT SPECIALIST DONALD HOWELL (1-800-790-5700 X41958).  DONALD ALSO EVENTUALLY SAID THAT GM WOULD NOT HELP WITH GETTING THE WORK PERFORMED.  THE SERVICE REQUEST # FOR MY CASE IS 71-758818423.  MY REQUIREMENT FOR RESOLUTION IS THAT GM REPAIRS THE ISSUE AT NO COST TO ME, MOST PREFERABLY BY REPLACING THE ABS WHEEL SENSORS WITH NEW ONES LESS LIKELY TO CORRODE.  I'M SURE THAT THE NEW PRODUCT DESIGN HAS THE CORROSION ISSUE IN MIND AND HAS FOUND A WAY TO AVOID IT.  AS THE REPAIR HISTORY OF MY VEHICLE SHOULD STATE, THE ABS WHEEL SENSORS WERE CLEANED AND THEN SPRAY PAINTED WITH A 'CORROSION RESISTANT PAINT' TO FIX THE ISSUE IN DEC 2005.  AS AN AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEER WHO WORKED FOR GM/DELPHI FOR 14 YEARS OF MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER, I KNOW THAT WHAT WAS PERFORMED PREVIOUSLY IS NOT A PERMANENT FIX.  I ALSO AM WILLING TO BET THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY CUSTOMER WITH RECURRENCE OF THIS ISSUE.  HAD IT BEEN FIXED CORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME ' WITH NEW ABS SENSORS - THEN THE PROBLEM WOULD NOT HAVE RECURRED.

I KEEP ALL THE SERVICE WORK UP ON IT THRU THE SELLING DEALER.    THE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE IS THAT THE QUDARSTEER CONTROL MODULE WENT OUT AND I CALLED GM FOR A SERVICE REQUEST. GM SET UP AN APPOINTMENT FOR ME WITH THE SELLING DEALER TO CHECK OUT THE PROBLEM. THE DEALERSHIP CHECKED OUT MY TRUCK AND TOLD ME THAT THE QUDRASTEER MODULE WAS BAD AND NEEDED REPLACED. THEY GOT ON THEIRE COMPUTER AND TRIED TO LOCATE A STEERING MODULE. BELIVE IT OR NOT THERE ISN'T ONE IN THE UNITED STATES. GM DOSEN'T MAKE THEM ANYMORE THEY HAVE BEEN DISCONTUINED. GM PRODUCED THIS TRUCK UNTILL 2005, I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY HAD TO SUPPLY PARTS FOR VEHICLES THAT THEY MADE FOR AT LEAST 10 YR'S I AM NOW STUCK WITH A TRUCK WITH 50,285 MILES ON IT AND WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE MANAGER NOT TO DRIVE IT BECAUSE IT WOULD WEAR UOT MY TIRES. THE DEALERSHIP DISABLED THE QUDRASTEER BUT WHEN I DRIVE IT I HAVE TO KEEP THE STEERING WHEEL TURNED TO THE RT ABOUT A QUARTER TURN. IT DRIVES LIKE A VEHICLE WITH A CENTER BOLT BROKEN IN THE REAR LEAF SPRINGS. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT MY RECORSE IS WITH GM. I CANNOT PUT ANOTHER REAR END IN IT FROM ANOTHER TRUCK BECAUSE THE DENALI'S REAR END IS 5 1/2\" WIDER THAN A RUGULAR PU. I  THINK GM SHOULD BE MADE TO START MAKING THE PARTS THAT THESE TRUCK'S NEED. I KNOW THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON THAT HAS RUN INTO THIS PROBLEM. ALL GM IS DOING FOR ME IS GIVING ME A LIST OF WEB SITES TO LOOK UP AND TRY TO FIND THE PART MYSELF. THERE ARE NONE!!!!!! MSRP ON THE TRUCK WAS $43,000. THE QUDRASTEER OPTION WAS $4,000. I DON'T THINK  THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO PARK MY TRUCK BECAUSE GM DOSEN'S WANT TO MAKE THE PART ANYMORE!!!!!! THE QUDRASTEER WENT OUT IN NOVENBER 2008, I STOPPED AT THE POST OFFICE TO CHECK MY MAIL AND WHEN I GOT BACK IN MY TRUCK AND STARTED IT THE SERVICE FOUR WHEEL STEERING LIGHT CAME ON THE DASH.

WHEN THE ENGINE OPERATES INTERMITTENTLY, THE MESSAGE LIGHT ILLUMINATES 'REDUCED ENGINE POWER' AND THE VEHICLE RUNS ROUGH AND ULTIMATELY STALLS.

BECAUSE THIS SENSOR HAS FAILED ON THE EXPRESSWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED (70 MPH) ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE THAT WE (OR SOMEONE ELSE) WERE NOT SERIOUSLY INJURED.  BECAUSE NHTSA RECALLED THE 2001 GMC SUVS/TRUCKS THAT HAD THIS DEFECTIVE CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR AND BECAUSE THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER 2002 SUVS/TRUCKS THAT ARE ALSO HAVING THEIR ENGINES FAIL DUE TO THIS SAME DEFECT, THE NHTSA SHOULD IMMEDIATELY INVESTIGATE HAVING GMC RECALL THE 2002 MODELS AS WELL.

THIS WAS JUST AFTER I REPLACED ALL TIRES. THIS YEAR I REPLACED ALL THE TIRES AGAIN AND THE CONDITION STILL EXISTS. WE WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF ELIMINATION, CHANGING A WHEEL THAT WAS A LITTLE OUT OF ROUND, RE-BALANCING AND ROTATING THE NEW TIRES 4 DIFFERENT TIMES AND COULDN'T ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM. I THEN PUT THE VEHICLE UP ON A HOIST AND PUT THE TRANSMISSION IN GEAR TO CHECK FOR DRIVE LINE VIBRATIONS AND FOUND THAT THE REAR DRIVE SHAFT WAS BENT. AFTER TAKING THE TRUCK BACK TO MY DEALERSHIP AND CONFIRMING THE PROBLEM WITH THEM, A SEARCH WAS RUN OF ALL THE SALVAGE FACILITIES FOR A USED SHAFT AND FOUND THAT THERE WERE NONE AVAILABLE. FURTHERMORE, EVERY SALVAGE YARD THAT WAS CONTACTED CLAIMED THAT THIS DRIVE SHAFT, GM PART #15109384 WAS IN HIGH DEMAND AND AS SOON AS ONE CAME IN ON A WRECK, IT WAS IMMEDIATELY SOLD. THIS SHAFT IS INSTALLED ON 2000 TO 2007 MODELS. MY DEALERSHIP ALSO ADMITTED THAT MINE WAS NOT THE FIRST BENT DRIVE SHAFT THAT HAS COME INTO THEIR FACILITY. TO PURCHASE A NEW SHAFT IS ALMOST $900. A USED ONE IS MUCH LESS, IF YOU CAN FIND ONE. I WORKED WITH GM TRUCK IN QUALITY CONTROL FOR 31 YEARS AND IT IS MY EXPERIENCE THAT WHEN A USED PART CAN NOT BE PURCHASED THROUGH A SALVAGE YARD DUE TO HIGH REPLACEMENT DEMAND, THERE IS USUALLY A COVER UP GOING ON. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS MATTER. BY THE WAY, MY SHAFT HAD NO VISIBLE EVIDENCE OF DAMAGE ANYPLACE. I BELIEVE THAT THE SHAFT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HANDLE THE TORQUE OF THE ENGINE AND WILL, IN TIME, BEND.

THIS CAUSED THE TRUCK TO HAVE EXCESSIVE FRONT WHEEL FRICTION, AND COMPROMISED THE BRAKING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TRUCK.  IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DRIVE, ESPECIALLY IN SNOW, AND THE FRONT WHEEL FRICTION WOULD VARY BASED ON CHANGES IN SPEED, ROAD CONTOUR, TEMPERATURE, STEERING INPUT, THROTTLE INPUT, AND BRAKE INPUT.  WHILE BRAKING THE TRUCK WOULD OFTEN PITCH SEVERELY TO ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER, THE ABS WOULD ACTIVATE ON DRY PAVEMENT.  ON ONE OCCASION THE ABS ACTIVATED WHEN MY FOOT WAS OFF THE BRAKE.  THE TRUCK WOULD ALSO SWAY FROM SIDE TO SIDE AT HIGHWAY SPEED AS THE FRICTION VARIED FROM SIDE TO SIDE.  WHEN THE TRUCK WAS RETURNED TO ME ONCE FROM CULLIGAN GMC, THE POWER STEERING EFFORT HAD INCREASED GREATLY.  THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE REAR LOCKING DIFFERENTIAL HAD BEEN CHANGED.  THE TRUCK WAS BACK TO THE DEALER, DAVID CADILLAC, MANY TIMES FOR THE SAME CONCERN WITH THE FRONT DIFFERENTIAL.  ON ONE OCCASION THE TRUCK WAS RETURNED TO ME GUSHING GEAR LUBE FROM THE FRONT AXLE, ON ANOTHER IT WAS RETURNED TO ME WITH THE FRONT DIFFERENTIAL EMPTY.  I WAS CHARGED FOR A 4 WHEEL ALIGNMENT WHEN ONLY 2 WHEELS CAN BE ALIGNED ON THIS TRUCK.  THE WRONG OIL FILTER WAS INSTALLED, THE TRUCK WAS DRIVEN ABUSIVELY BY A DEALER EMPLOYEE (IT WAS RUN BEYOND MECHANICAL LIMITS WHILE COLD AS I STOOD IN THE PARKING LOT), AND WHEN I CALLED THE SERVICE ADVISER AFTER THE TRUCK HAD BEEN IN HIS SHOP FOR OVER A WEEK WITHOUT MY HEARING WHAT IT'S STATUS WAS, THE SERVICE PERSON SCREAMED AT ME ON THE PHONE \"WHEN IT IS FINISHED I WILL CALL YOU!!!\", AND HE SLAMMED THE PHONE DOWN.  *NM",

THE TREAD SEPARATED FROM THE SIDEWALL/BODY OF THE TIRE EXPOSING STEELBELTS. THE TREAD WAS NOT RECOVERABLE. THE FAILED TIRE DID NOT EXPLODE OR DISINTEGRATE AND REMAINED INFLATED. THE TIRE HAD ACCUMULATED 32650 MILES SINCE NEW (OEM TIRE) WITHOUT INCIDENT.

ALL TIRES WERE WITHIN 1 LB OF ANOTHER AND REGISTERED 84 PSI (WARM INFLATION PRESSURE).   CONTACT WITH FIRESTONE INDICATED THAT THE TIRE SHOULD BE INSPECTED BY FIRESTONE ENGINEERS TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE. THE TIRE WAS SHIPPED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR INSTRUCTIONS. FIRESTONE ENGINEERS CONCLUDED THAT THE TIRE WAS \"OPERATED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AT A PRESSURE INSUFFICIENT FOR THE LOAD BEING CARRIED\". THE LOAD ON THE TIRE WAS ESTIMATED NOT TO EXCEED 2500 LBS. THE FAILED TIRE RETAINED NEARLY 70 PSI WHEN CHECKED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FAILURE DESPITE A SMALL LEAK FROM THE SEPARATION. THE TIRE WAS NOT DAMAGED BY ROAD HAZARDS OR OTHERWISE SUBJECTED TO NEGLECT.
