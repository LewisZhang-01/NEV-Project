THE PREVIOUS OWNER HAD THE IGNITION SWITCH REPLACED AT THE TIME OF THE RECALL. I DISCOVERED THAT THE CAR WAS SHUTTING OFF WITH NO WARNING WHILE I WAS DRIVING. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION ON THE HONDA RECALL WEBSITE, THIS PART NEEDS TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE SUMMARY: ON CERTAIN SEDANS, COUPES, HATCHBACKS, AND SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES, ELECTRICAL CONTACTS IN THE IGNITION SWITCH CAN DEGRADE DUE TO THE HIGH ELECTRICAL CURRENT PASSING THROUGH THE SWITCH WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STARTED.CONSEQUENCE: WORN CONTACTS COULD CAUSE THE ENGINE TO STALL WITHOUT WARNING, INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH. HONDA IS NOT THEREFORE CORRECTING THE CAUSE OF THE IGNITION SWITCH DEGRADATION, THEY ARE SIMPLY ADMITTING THAT IT WEARS OUT PREMATURELY AND POSES A SAFETY HAZARD SO THEY ARE REQUIRED TO REPLACE IT. IT HAS NOW BEEN 13 YEARS SINCE IT WAS REPLACED AND I BELIEVE THAT IT HAS WORN OUT. WHEN I TOOK IT IN TO HONDA ON GRAND, I WAS TOLD THAT THE IGNITION SWITCH DID IN FACT NEED TO BE REPLACED, BUT THAT THE CAR ALSO HAD A BAD CYLINDER AND THEY WANTED $798.00 TO FIX BOTH WITH TWO HOURS OF LABOR. THEY INSISTED THAT SINCE THE PART HAD BEEN REPLACED UNDER THE ORIGINAL RECALL, THEY WERE NOT REQUIRED TO REPLACE IT AGAIN. I AM DISPUTING THIS SINCE HONDA ADMITS THAT THE PART WEARS OUT FASTER DUE TO THE CONFIGURATION, I.E., HIGH ELECTRICAL CHARGE, AND THIS POSES A SAFETY RISK AS IT CAUSES THE CAR TO DIE OUT. THE CAR WAS ONLY THREE YEARS OLD WHEN THE PART WAS REPLACED DURING THE ORIGINAL RECALL, AND THEY HAVE ALREADY SUBSTANTIATED THAT THE PART IS WORN OUT. IN ADDITION, HONDA CHARGES ALMOST $300 FOR THE IGNITION SWITCH, BUT IT IS AVAILABLE ON THE INTERNET FOR $40.00, AND IT ONLY REQUIRED 30 MINUTES TO REPLACE.   *JS",

ENTRANCE RAMP, THERE WAS A LOUD BANG AND I SAW LARGE PIECES OF TIRE DEBRIS IN THE AIR NEAR THE REAR OF OUR VEHICLE.  SEVERAL VEHICLES SWERVED SHARPLY TO AVOID OUR VEHICLE AND THE TIRE DEBRIS.  I PULLED ONTO THE SHOULDER AND UPON EXAMINATION FOUND THE RIGHT REAR TIRE (FACING FORWARD) HAD COMPLETELY LOST ALL OF ITS TREAD.  THE TIRE WAS STILL INFLATED SO I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE TO A TIRE DEALERSHIP ON ST. LUCIE BLVD. AND PURCHASE A NEW TIRE, HOWEVER THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $1,200 IN DAMAGE TO THE CRV.  THE TIRE HAD APPROXIMATELY 12,000 MILES OF USE ON IT.

I WOULD HAVE TO MANUALLY SET THE LATCH MECHANISM PRIOR TO SLAMMING IT SHUT TO SECURE IT.  I MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE THE DEALER CHECK AND CORRECT THE PROBLEM THIS WEEK.  THEY REPLACED THE MECHANISM AND CHARGED ME $173 ($40 FOR THE PART AND $133 LABOR).  THEY GAVE ME THE \"OLD\" PART TO EXAMINE.  I AM A GRADUATE MECHANICAL ENGINEER AND EXPERIENCED IN AUTOMOTIVE CORROSION ISSUES.  I WAS SHOCKED AT THE CONDITION OF THE HANDLE ASSEMBLY THEY REPLACED.  IT WAS IN AN ADVANCED STATE OF CORROSION TO THE EXTENT IT WAS \"FROZEN\" SHUT DUE TO CORROSION.  I HAVE TWO ISSUES WITH THIS:  1.  THE LOCATION OF THE LATCH IS MOSTLY PROTECTED FROM THE EXTERNAL ELEMENTS AND SHOULD NOT HAVE CORRODED THIS MUCH.  I KEEP THE CAR GARAGED.  IN THE WINTER, I TAKE IT THROUGH A CAR WASH PERHAPS TWICE/MONTH.  IN OTHER SEASONS I WASH THE CAR BY HAND ALSO ABOUT TWICE/MONTH.  2.  THIS IS EITHER A DESIGN PROBLEM OR A QUALITY PROBLEM.

A DETERMINATION WAS MADE TO TAKE 4 TIRES OF A SIMILAR VEHICLE WITH NO WHEEL VIBRATION AND PUT THEM ON MY VEHICLE.  THIS AGAIN DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THEN DECIDED TO REMOVE THE FRONT AXLE FROM MY VEHICLE AND REPLACE IT WITH THAT OF THE VEHICLE WITHOUT THE PROBLEM.  THIS DID NOT HELP. AT THIS TIME, I REQUESTED THAT MY VEHICLE TO BE RETURNED TO ME AND FILED  A DEFECT NOTIFICATION FORM UNDER FLORIDA'S MOTOR VEHICLE LEMON LAW. AMERICAN HONDA'S REPRESENTATIVE HAS CONTACTED ME AND HAS SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT WITH THEIR FIELD ENGINEER FOR NOVEMBER 16, 1999.  I BELIEVE THAT 4 WEEKS IS MUCH TO LONG TO WAIT AS THIS PROBLEM MAY RESULT IN A DRIVING SAFETY HAZARD.  THIS VEHICLE IS MY PRIMARY SOURCE OF TRANSPORTATION AND AS A DISABLED VETERAN IT IS NEEDED FOR TRANSPORTATION TO AND FROM MY REGIONAL VA MEDICAL CENTER. I HAD SPOKEN TO THE DEALERSHIP'S GENERAL MANAGER IN AN ATTEMPT TO TURN IN THIS VEHICLE (WHICH ACTUALLY CAME FROM ANOTHER DEALERSHIP) FOR SIMILAR VEHICLE AS AN AMICABLE SOLUTION TO THIS SITUATION BUT THIS WAS DENIED.",
