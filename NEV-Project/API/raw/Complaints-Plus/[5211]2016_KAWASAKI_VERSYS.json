DURING THE COURSE OF THOSE MILES I HAVE NEVER DAMAGED THE WHEELS ON ANY OF THE MOTORCYCLES.    I PURCHASED MY 2016 KAWASAKI VERSYS 1000LT NEW IN MARCH 16 AND BENT MY FIRST FRONT WHEEL IN JULY AT APPROXIMATELY 7,000 MILES. I WAS JUST RIDING ON A STATE HIGHWAY AND DO NOT RECALL HITTING ANYTHING THAT MIGHT DAMAGE A WHEEL.    I REPLACED THE WHEEL WITH A NEW KAWASAKI FACTORY FRONT WHEEL AND LESS THAN 2,000 MILES LATER - I BENT IT. ONCE AGAIN I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CAUSED THE DAMAGE AS THE BIKE NEVER WAS RIDDEN OFF PAVEMENT.    I BELIEVE THAT KAWASAKI IS USING WHEELS THAT ARE TO LIGHT WEIGHT FOR THIS CLASS OF MOTORCYCLE.",
