UPON FURTHER INSPECTION I OBSERVED THE RAW FUEL WAS COMING OUT OF THE FUEL MODULE CONNECTING FUEL LINE. THE METAL FUEL LINE SITS IN A WELL OF THE REAR TANK AND WAS COMPLETELY COVERED WITH DIRT/MOISTURE/RAW FUEL.  THE TANK WAS REMOVED AND WE IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THAT THE METAL PORTION OF THE FUEL MODULE METAL PIPING WAS RUSTED THRU AND THAT WAS WHERE THE RAW FUEL WAS BEING SPRAYED/POOLING IN THE WELL AREA.  THE DESIGN OF THE FUEL TANK & MODULE CREATES A PERFECT LOCATION FOR DIRT/MOISTURE TO ACCUMULATE.  ANY TYPE OF IGNITION SOURCE COULD HAVE CAUSED A CATASTROPHIC FIRE AND POSSIBLE EXPLOSION.  THE REMOVED ORIGINAL FUEL MODULE WAS IN PERFECT WORKING CONDITION EXCEPT FOR THE ROTTED METAL PORTION OF THE MODULE.  I REPLACED THE ROTTED FUEL MODULE WITH A NEW GM OEM FUEL MODULE.  THIS NEW MODULE HAS THE SAME EXACT CONSTRUCTION AS THE ORIGINAL PART.  SINCE THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY TO CLEAN OR KEEP CLEAN THE WELL AREA OF THE TANK, I CAN ONLY ASSUME THE NEW OEM PART WILL DETERIORATE IN THE SAME MANNER.  THE VEHICLE HAD ABOUT 34000 MILES ON IT WHEN THE CONDITION OCCURRED.  SINCE IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY THE NEW MODULE COSTS FOR LABOR AND PARTS WAS IN EXCESS OF $1000.00.  IN CONCLUSION I THINK THIS MATTER SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER BECAUSE IT IS OBVIOUSLY A SAFETY HAZARD INVOLVING RAW FUEL BEING EJECTED FROM THE FUEL TANK UNDER PRESSURE WHILE THE PUMP IS RUNNING.",

HALF OF THE ENGINE WAS REBUILT DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF CARBON BUILT UP INSIDE THE ENGINE. AGAIN AT 78,000 MILES THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WENT ON AGAIN. THIS TIME THE DEALERSHIP HAD THE VEHICLE FOR 2 WEEKS TO AND DETERMINED THE ENGINE HAD EXCESSIVE CARBON BUILD UP AND A ENGINE SOAK WAS PERFORMED ALONG WITH SPLASH GUARDS ADDED TO THE VALVE COVERS TO KEEP THE ENGINE OIL FROM ESCAPING AS THE AFM WAS OPEARTIONAL. AT 98,000 MILES THE OIL PRESSURE SENSOR AND THE VALVE COVER GASKET HAD TO BE REPLACED. NOW, AT 140,000 MILES THE WATER PUMP, CRANK SHAFT AND BEARINGS HAD TO BE REPLACED. THE DEALERSHIP SAID I NEEDED A NEW ENGINE BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT REBUILD THE ENGINE DUE TO THE MILEAGE. I HAVE CHANGED THE OIL EVERY 3,000 MILES AND STARTED USING FULL SYNTHETIC MOTOR OIL SINCE MY ENGINE ISSUES AT 33,000 MILES. GM IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE WITH THE AFM AND CONTINUES TO DO NOTHING.

I BROUGHT THE TRUCK TO AN AUTO PARTS STORE WHERE THEY READ THE FAULT CODE. THE CODE IS P0521 - OIL PRESSURE SENSOR OR OIL LOW. I CHECKED THE OIL IT WAS NEARLY FULL BUT I ADDED A LITTLE ANYWAY. THE LIGHT STAYED ON. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT AT THE DEALER. THE LIGHT WENT OFF THE DAY BEFORE OUR APPOINTMENT. I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER AND NOW THEY ARE TELLING ME THAT THE TRUCK PROBABLY NEEDS AN OIL PUMP AND A VALVE COVER AND IT WILL COST APPROXIMATELY $1075.00 TO FIX.     I HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ON THIS PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF OWNER COMPLAINTS ON VARIOUS WEBSITES DOCUMENTING THE SAME PROBLEM I AM HAVING. THERE APPEARS TO BE A DEFECT IN THE DESIGN OF THE OIL SYSTEM IN THESE VEHICLES. MY TRUCK JUST WENT OUT OF WARRANTY IN DECEMBER 2014. THEY WANT ME TO PAY FOR THIS REPAIR EVEN THOUGH I HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR REPAIRS FOR THE SAME PROBLEM WHILE IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY. THIS APPEARS TO BE A SERIOUS PRODUCT DEFECT AND GM SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL.    *TR",
