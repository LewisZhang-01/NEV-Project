        "summary": "I purchased  a 2020 Thor/Dutchman Astoria Fifth wheel travel trailer Model number 3173 on 04-02-2021  from DeMontrond  RV in Houston Texas. There was bent metal Damage to the pin box support which the dealer said was not a problem as it had been checked out. On the way back home from Houston Texas to Lake Havasu City Arizona ( 1400 miles) the trailed swayed badly to the point i had to slow down to stop the sway. I took the trailer to 3 RV dealers , who said that the pin box support had been bent from a catastophic bending force( the dealer never said anything prior and during  delivery about that). the last dealer told me that he had a relative that had a similar trailer , who had the same sway problem, and contacted Coachman who said  they didnt know anything about that problem. The dealer said that it might have something to do with suspension  or axle placement. I did some checking and found that the axles on the 2021 Astoria had been moved eleven inches to the rear to stop the sway, in other words, THE FACTORY KNEW ABOUT THE SAFETY ISSUE , didnt tell anyone , but fixed the problem in the 2021 model. In short , they INTENTIONALLY  sold a DEFECTIVE  DANGEROUS  trailer to the dealers and the public  The problem cannot be fixed, as the whole trailer has been moved on its chassis to accommodate the eleven inches of axle placement to the rear of the trailer. I have contacted the Texas Department of motor vehicles and filled a safety complaint , and have also contacted Dutchman Trailers , but so far have not heard from them. I am not using the trailer as its too much of a safety/ liability issue  My trailer is available for inspection any time  . The manufacturer is welcome anytime to inspect the problem , but why would they, they already know the problem.",
