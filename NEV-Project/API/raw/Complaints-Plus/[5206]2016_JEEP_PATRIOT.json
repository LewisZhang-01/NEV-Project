I waited several minutes and restarted the engine which then operated normally afterward.   This engine stalling has occurred repeatedly & more frequently (6+ times in last 10 days) while accelerating from a stop which is very dangerous in cross-traffiic intersections and on freeways.   Additionally now,  the engine rpm\u2019s intermittently surge notably up and down +/- 2,000 rpm while driving with steady un-changing pressure on gas pedal. I have seen no engine failure indicators.   I have had this vehicle serviced at two different independent repair shops that couldn\u2019t re-create the problem & guessed it was the throttle body and then cleaned/serviced it. The problem persists more frequently, and is the exact problem listed in the S89 ChryslerJeep recall.   My vin is not referenced in the recall notice-even though it is from the same Jeep manufacture period. This recall should definitely apply to my vehicle.   I drive 40 freeway miles daily to work and am concerned for my safety and others. My vehicle is available for inspection if needed and I am bringing it tomorrow to a Jeep dealer in hopes of having it repaired under the recall.

There was a recall for this part, but the recall only covered vehicles built between May and July 2016. Having an indicator light on the dashboard for this single part...is very telling.

WENT TO JEEP, IN RENO, NV, WHICH DIAGNOSED IT AS A CAMSHAFT SENSOR ERROR; IT WOULD NEED TO BE REPAIRED BUT NOT CRITICAL.  TECH RESET SENSOR, AND SAID IF IT COMES ON AGAIN, WE SHOULD SET A DATE FOR REPAIR.  ON SEPT 3, 6:40PM, DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, COMING OUT OF AN INTERCHANGE, MY CAR SHUT DOWN!  EVERYTHING. LUCKILY, CLOSE ENOUGH, I COASTED OFF TO THE RIGHT AND TOOK THE FIRST EXIT, BRAKED HARD, AND CAME TO STOP.  COULDN'T RESTART. ORDERED A TOW.  TEN MIN LATER, TRIED AGAIN, THE CAR STARTED, AND DROVE IT 3 MILES HOME @ 25 MPH.  HIT 30MPH, IT KINDA 'CHUNKED', AND I WENT BACK TO 24-25MPH.  SEPT 4, I TOOK TO LITHIA JEEP, AGAIN. LEFT IT WITH THEM. THEY CALLED ME LATER, AND SAID IT WAS THE CRANKSHAFT SENSOR, AND WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED.  TOTAL COST: $700. THEY KEPT IT OVER THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND, AND WILL FIX & RETURN, SEPT 8, 2020.  I GOOGLED THE ISSUE; DISCOVERED A RECALL FOR JEEP PATRIOT'S MANUFACTURED MAY-JULY 2016.  TODAY, SEPT 7, CONTACTED THE CHRYSLER RECALL DEPT, REGARDING THE S89 RECALL, LEARNED MY VEHICLE WAS MANUFACTURED JAN 15, 2016, AND NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL S89.  MY VEHICLE, SAME MAKE/MODEL, WITH THE EXACT SAME ISSUES AS IN THE RECALL.  THE AGENT SAID I HAVE TO GET THE DEALER TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE IS THE SAME AS THE RECALL; THEN REQUEST A REVIEW BY THE JEEP DEALER'S REGIONAL SUPERVISOR, WHO, IF APPROVES, ALLOWS ME TO SUBMIT PAPERWORK, TO REQUEST CHRYSLER PAY ALL BILLS RELATED TO ISSUE, BACK TO THE JULY 2020 CAMSHAFT SENSOR ISSUE, UP TO AND INCLUDING THE REPAIR OF BOTH THE CAMSHAFT SENSOR, AND THE CRANKSHAFT SENSOR.    THIS SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF FOOTWORK FOR ME, LET ALONE ALL THE PAPERWORK TO SUBMIT FOR, HOPEFULLY, PAYMENT AFTER THE FACT, FOR WORK RELATED TO A RECALL.  CAN YOU STEP IN AND HELP?  CAN YOU ADD MORE VEHICLES MANUFACTURE DATES TO THE RECALL, TO INCLUDE MINE?",

NO MAJOR ISSUES PRIOR. 2 WEEKS AGO HOWEVER, I WAS LEFT STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF A HIGHWAY ENTRANCE RAMP, ALMOST REAR-ENDED BY A SEMI AND SIDE SWIPING A CONSTRUCTION SIGN TO AVOID BEING HIT. WHEN ACCELERATING THE ETC SYMBOL (LIGHTENING BOLT) WILL DISPLAY, TRACTION CONTROL ICON AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WILL DISPLAY. THE JEEP COMPLETELY STOPS ACCELERATING (HIGHWAY SPEED TO 0 MPH WITHIN SECONDS=DEADLY), IT WILL SHAKE BEFORE JUST DYING. IF I'M LUCKY I'LL MAKE IT TO THE SHOULDER (IF IT HAPPENS TO HAVE ONE). THROUGH GOOGLE RESEARCH, I CAME ACROSS A WAY TO DO A \"RESET\" (TURN CAR OFF, INSERT KEY AND TURN \"ON\", PRESS GAS PEDAL SLOWLY, RELEASE SLOWLY, TURN CAR OFF AND THEN RESTART THE ENGINE). DOING THIS TYPICALLY CLEARS THE ICONS AND I'M ABLE TO TRAVEL AGAIN. THIS INTERMITTENTLY HAPPENS, SO YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'RE POTENTIALLY ABOUT TO BE INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT FROM STOPPING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROADWAY.  WHEN DRIVING ON CITY/TOWN ROADS, IT HAS NOT COMPLETED STOPPED AS STATED ABOVE, BUT WILL \"JUMP\" WHEN SWITCHING GEARS, THEN THROW THE ETC SYMBOL. IF I LET OFF THE GAS, THE ICON GOES AWAY AND CAR RUNS NORMAL.  I TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC 1 DAY AGO AND WAS TOLD TO GET A NEW BATTERY. THE BATTERY WAS CHANGED 1 DAY AGO AND THE ISSUE OCCURRED MULTIPLE TIMES TODAY. THROUGH ONLINE SEARCHES IT APPEARS THIS IS A TERRIBLY COMMON ISSUE THAT JEEP HAS YET TO ADDRESS! SOMEONE IS GOING TO END UP LOSING THEIR LIFE BECAUSE OF THIS MALFUNCTION. THERE APPEARS TO BE NO WAY OF KNOWING THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN OR ANY PREVENTATIVE MEASURES THAT A TYPICAL PERSON WOULD KNOW TO TAKE TO AVOID THIS DEADLY MALFUNCTION. AS EASY AS IT IS TO JUST TAKE IT TO A MECHANIC, THAT IS NOT FINANCIALLY POSSIBLE FOR EVERYONE AND IN THIS SITUATION NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY JEEP AS IT IS RECURRING ISSUE AND IS DEADLY.

I FOUND A WEBSITE THAT SAID THERE WAS A CRANKSHAFT/CAMSHAFT RECALL ON THE MAKE, MODEL, AND AND YEAR OF MY VEHICLE. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM THE RECALLED VEHICLES WERE HAVING WAS THE SAME AS MINE.   SO I CALLED MY DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO DISCUSS THIS RECALL TO SEE IF THEY WOULD FIX MY VEHICLE.  THEY RAN MY V.I.N. NUMBER AND I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO RECALL ON IT.  THEY WANT ME TO BRING IT IN FOR A ANOTHER DIAGNOSTIC SCAN.  I ASKED THEM TO GIVE ME A GUESS AS TO HOW MUCH IT WILL COST ME.  I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THEM YET.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE V.I.N. MAKES A DIFFERENCE SINCE MY VEHICLE IS  THE SAME MAKE, MODEL ,AND YEAR AS ONES ON RECALL.

IT NO LONGER HAD ANY FORCE AGAINST IT BUT COULD BE FREELY MOVED THROUGHOUT ITS RANGE OF MOTION WITH NO ENGAGEMENT OR DISENGAGEMENT OF THE TRANSMISSION WHICH LEFT THE VEHICLE IN GEAR AS I WAS TRYING TO STOP.  THIS CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO STALL AND LEFT IT DISABLED IN THE CENTER LANE OF A VERY BUSY 5 LANE ROAD APPROXIMATELY 40FT FROM A BUSY INTERSECTION.  THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO AN IMPROPERLY INSTALLED FITTING IN THE WALL FORWARD OF THE DRIVER PEDALS THROUGH WHICH THE CLUTCH ROD PASSES.  THIS WAS A MANUFACTURER INSTALLATION AS THE CAR HAD 20 MILES ON IT WHEN PURCHASED AND THE FAILURE OCCURRED AT 150 MILES.  THE FITTING MUST BE SEATED TO ALLOW THE CLUTCH ROD TO ENGAGE/DISENGAGE WHEN THE PEDAL IS PRESSED.  A MISALIGNMENT OF THE HOLE IN THE WALL AND THE CLUTCH ROD CAUSED UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE FITTING WHICH WAS ENOUGH TO HOLD IT IN PLACE TEMPORARILY BUT EVENTUALLY CAME LOOSE.  THE PROPER INSTALLATION OF THE FITTING IS TO PROTRUDE FULLY THROUGH THE WALL AND THEN BE CLOCKED 45DEG SO THE TABS SEAT, KEEPING THE FITTING IN PLACE.  A POLICE OFFICER WAS ABLE TO ASSIST WITH THE TRAFFIC OBSTACLE WHILE WAITING FOR A TOW TRUCK AND THERE WERE NO INJURIES AS A RESULT.  THE LOSS OF THE CLUTCH ON A MANUAL TRANSMISSION VEHICLE AT ANY GIVEN TIME CAN CAUSE A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.

THE FAILURE OF THE HORN TO SOUND WHEN NEEDED CAUSED ME TO TAKE EVASIVE MANEUVERS BECAUSE THE OTHER DRIVERS DIDN'T HEAR IT IN TIME.  NOVEMBER 2015 IN HOBOKEN NEW JERSEY I WAS HEADING NORTH ON WASHINGTON STREET AT 25 MPH WHEN SOMEONE STARTED TO BACK OUT OF A CURB FACING PARKING SPOT.

I HAD TO DRIVE ONTO TO WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD TO AVOID HIM.  LUCKILY NO ONE WAS APPROACHING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  AGAIN IN NOVEMBER OF 2015 I WAS HEADING NORTH ON US ROUTE 202, DOING ABOUT 30 MPH IN A 40 MPH ZONE IN PARSIPPANY NEW JERSEY.  A CAR SHOOTS OUT OF A CORPORATE PARK DRIVEWAY HEADED STRAIGHT TOWARD ME.  I HELD DOWN THE HORN AND AGAIN IT SOUNDED ABOUT A HALF A SECOND LATER, TOO LATE FOR THE ONCOMING DRIVER TO REALIZE IT.  WE BOTH SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES WHEN WE SAW EACH OTHER AND LUCKILY THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT.  DECEMBER 2015 IN WAYNE NEW JERSEY HEADING WEST ON PREAKNESS AVENUE (ONE LANE IN EACH DIRECTION) I APPROACHED A CURVE TO THE RIGHT TRAVELING AT 25 MPH.  THE DRIVER OF AN ONCOMING CAR (ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD) CROSSED OVER THE DOUBLE YELLOW LINES ONTO MY SIDE OF THE ROAD.  I HELD DOWN THE HORN AND IT DIDN'T SOUND UNTIL THE OTHER DRIVER ALMOST HIT ME.  LUCKILY THERE WAS A SMALL SHOULDER ON MY SIDE AND I WAS ABLE TO QUICKLY MOVE MY RIGHT TWO WHEELS ONTO IT AND AVOID THE COLLISION.
