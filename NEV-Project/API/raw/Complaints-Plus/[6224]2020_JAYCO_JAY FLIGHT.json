THERE ARE NO HOOKUPS AT THIS CAMPGROUND SO WAS RUNNING GENERATOR DURING THE DAY AND BATTERY/ PROPANE AT NIGHT.  EVERYTHING WAS GOING GREAT UNTIL THE FOURTH DAY WE WERE THERE.    I WOKE UP AT 6 IN THE MORNING THURSDAY THE JUNE 18, 2020 TO A VERY LOUD POP AND A RUSHING SOUND.

I TOLD MY WIFE TO GET OUR KIDS OUT IMMEDIATELY AS IT WAS BLACK ACRID SMOKE FILLING THE TRAILER. I WENT OUT THE DOOR AND SAW FLAMES GUSHING OUT OF THE ACCESS PANEL FOR THE REFRIGERATOR. I IMMEDIATELY RAN AROUND THE SIDE SHUTTING OFF THE PROPANE TANK AND THEN GRABBED OUR FIRE EXTINGUISHER TO PUT THE FLAMES OUT.    IF I HADN'T WOKE TO THE SOUND I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED AS THE BUNKHOUSE IS AT THE VERY REAR WITH THE FRIDGERATOR IN BETWEEN OUR BED AND THE KIDS BUNKS.

I REALLY AM NOT CERTAIN THOUGH. THE PRE-DELIVERY INSPECTION DID NOT INCLUDE SHOWING US THE REAR OF THE REFRIGERATOR ACCESS BUT AFTER GETTING HOME I DID PEEK IN THERE AND NOTHING SEEMED TO BE A MISS.
