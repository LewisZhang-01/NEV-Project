I DISCOVERED THAT THE ROOT CAUSE WAS THE  MALFUNCTION OF THE REAR BRAKES.  THE REAR CALIPERS ARE DESIGNED, THAT WHEN THEY CORRODE THE BRAKING ACTION IS DIMINISHED AND EVENTUALLY STOPS WHEN THE CALIPERS ARE COMPLETELY FROZEN. THIS FAILURE CAUSES SUBSEQUENT PROBLEMS :  1. BECAUSE THE FRONT BRAKES NOW CARRY MORE BREAKING LOAD THE PAD WEARS OUT VERY QUICKLY. 2. BECAUSE THE FRONT BRAKES NOW CARRY MORE BREAKING LOAD THE ROTORS WILL  WARP AND REQUIRE FREQUENT TURNING,  WHICH EVENTUALLY RENDERS THE ROTOR BELOW SPECIFIED THICKNESS AND MUST BE REPLACED .  3. THE REAR CALIPERS CAN SOMETIMES LOCK IN THE ENGAGED POSITION. THIS WILL CAUSE EXCESS AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS HEAT IN THE BRAKES. THIS WILL EVENTUALLY RUIN ROTORS AND MAY PRESENT A FIRE HAZARD.   4. THE LACK OF BREAKING IN THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE CAUSES AN IMBALANCE  IN THE BREAKING  CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VEHICLE. THIS WILL CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO LERCH SIDEWAYS IN AN EMERGENCY BREAKING SITUATION AS THE INERTIA FROM THE REAR IS NOT IMPEDED, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP WITH ANY CONTROL.
