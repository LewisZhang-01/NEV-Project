IN JAN 2016 WE MOVED OUT OF STATE TO DC WHERE WE PARK THE CAR AND RARELY DRIVE THE CAR, THEREFORE THE AMOUNT OF MILEAGE THIS LASTED WAS UNACCEPTABLE. WE HAD TO PAY $420 TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE LATCH REPAIR (FORD DID REFUND US $284 SINCE THEY FELT BAD EVEN THOUGH IT WAS OUT OF THE 12 MONTH WARRANTY) BUT ALSO HAS TO PAY $255 RENTAL CAR WHICH DURING HOLIDAY WEEK IN A VACATION TOWN WE GOT THE LAST RENTAL CAR.

SO I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT EITHER FORD DID NOT ACTUALLY REPLACE THE DOOR LATCH IN NOV 2015, OR IF THEY DID THE REPLACEMENTS ARE MORE FAULTY AND A 12 MONTH WARRANTY IS INSUFFICIENT FOR A SAFETY ISSUE.",
