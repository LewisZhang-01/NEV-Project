        "summary": "Dear Sir/Madam,    Our Lexus ES350 2008 has front panel melting and cracking.  The melting plastic could emit hazardous fumes with health risk to driver and passengers. This melting panel looks awful, it dramatically decreases value of the car.    We found this ZLZ program online below. But unfortunately it expired. We never received the ZLZ notice even though Lexus had our contact info (This is based on the fact that they sent us numerous letters on the air bag recalls.) https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/tsbs/2018/MC-10145764-9999.pdf     We called  Lexus, they admit it was due to defective material but unwilling to do anything for us. Apparently they treat recalls very seriously but try to do minimum for this defective plastic panel issue.    Many people have similar complaints here below https://www.carcomplaints.com/news/2017/toyota-lexus-melting-dashboard-lawsuit.shtml     We sincerely request NHTSA to review this Lexus front panel melting and cracking issue again. All Lexus owners with this defective material issue should get full repair by manufacturer without limitation. If necessary, please consider a full recall for this issue so Lexus can treat this more seriously.      Thanks for your attention.      Regards!",

THE NEXT UNDERPASS, I GET AGAIN HARD BRAKING BY THE CAR AND BROADSIDE SWING INTO THE LEFT LANE.  I KNOW IT IS AN ISSUE WITH THE CAR BECAUSE I DID NOT BRAKE.  NEXT UNDERPASS I HAVE TO SLOW TO 30MPH TO MAKE SURE THE CAR COMING UP BESIDE ME IS CLEAR BECAUSE I KNOW I WILL SWING TO THE LEFT.  I AM NOT ACCELERATING OR BRAKING AND YES, AGAIN AT 30MPH IT BRAKES AND I GO BROADSIDE TO THE LEFT.

WE CONTACTED LEXUS IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER AND WAS TOLD A CASE MANAGER WOULD CALL US BACK WITHIN 2-3 BUSINESS DAYS. WE RECEIVED A CALL ON OR AROUND AUGUST 1, 2016 AND SPOKE WITH A CASE MANAGER, \"ZANDRA\". SHE REITERATED THE INFORMATION FOUND IN THE NOTICE AND INFORMED US THAT A RENTAL VEHICLE COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE IF NEEDED AND WE WOULD BE REIMBURSED FOR THIS VEHICLE. WE INFORMED ZANDRA THAT SINCE WE WERE IN COLORADO AT THIS TIME, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DRIVE THE CAR WITHOUT SOMEONE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT DURING THIS TIME AND WE DID NOT WANT TO DRIVE THIS CAR HOME WITH THIS CURRENT RECALL IN PLACE.  ZANDRA DID NOT GIVE US ANY OTHER OPTION FOR US AT THIS TIME. WE AGAIN CALLED THE LEXUS CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE (800-255-3987) ON AUGUST 4, 2016 AND SPOKE TO \"MICHAEL\". WE INFORMED MICHAEL OF OUR PREVIOUS CONVERSATION WITH ZANDRA AND REQUESTED WE SPEAK TO HER. WE INFORMED MICHAEL OF OUR SITUATION AND INFORMED HIM THAT HAVING A RENTAL CAR DOES NOT ALLOW US TO GET OUR CURRENT CAR HOME. WE REQUESTED THAT IN LIEU OF A RENTAL CAR WE WOULD PREFER TO HAVE THE CAR SHIPPED BACK TO OUR FLORIDA ADDRESS WHERE WE HAVE A SECONDARY CAR TO USE. THIS WOULD BE A CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE FOR LEXUS THAN GIVING US A VEHICLE RENTAL FOR MONTHS. WE WERE INFORMED BY MICHAEL THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 3 BUSINESS DAYS (PLUS THE WEEKEND) TO RECEIVE A CALL BACK FROM ZANDRA.
