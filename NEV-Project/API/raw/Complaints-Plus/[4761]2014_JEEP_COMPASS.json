WE WERE ON A SCHEDULE, SO VEHICLE WAS SHUT OFF IMMEDIATELY AND WE USED OUR OTHER VEHICLE FOR TRANSPORT. BOTH CODES WERE RESEARCHED TO DETERMINE BEST REPAIR METHODS. SINCE THE P0171 WAS A REPEAT CODE, AND THE P2173 WAS AN UNFAMILIAR SAE CODE NOT NORMALLY USED ON MY PREVIOUS VEHICLES, A COMPLETE DISASSEMBLY OF THE INTAKE WAS WARRANTED. I AM MECHANICALLY COMPETENT DUE TO TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE AND KNOW MY OWN LIMITS OF COMPETENCY AND TOOLS FOR REPAIR. HERE ARE THE BASICS FOR REFERENCE OF WHAT WAS FOUND. 1. THE PCV VALVE (MULTIAIRE) HAD FAILED AT THE INTERNAL PINTLE, AND WAS ALLOWING CRANKCASE AIR/OIL TO ENTER THE INTAKE AT TOO HIGH A VOLUME. IT WAS REPLACED. THE MAP SENSOR SET THE P2173 CODE, THEN FAILED DUE TO OIL INTRUSION AND WAS REPLACED. THE RAPID SNAPPING OF THE THROTTLE BODY UNDER PRESSURE UNCALIBRATED THE INTERNAL THROTTLE POSITION SENSORS, AND COULD NOT MAINTAIN PROPER POSITION WAS REPLACED. THE INTAKE MANIFOLD (NEWER DESIGN FOR THE 2.0L I4 WITHOUT THE FLAPPER CONTROLS JUST GUIDE VEINS FOR THE INTAKE AIR) MAIN GASKET HAD SHRUNK IN THE PLASTIC INTAKE SEAT CHANNEL AND WAS ALLOWING OUTSIDE AIR (P0171) TO SEEP PAST THE GASKET ON THE LOWER  LIP OF THE GASKET, AND WAS ALSO NOT SEALING BETWEEN THE CYLINDERS (GASES WERE TRANSFERRING BETWEEN THE CYLINDERS). THE THROTTLE BODY GASKET WAS PRISTINE. DURING REPAIR, PRESSURE TESTED INTAKE FOR LEAKS, AND TUBES AND LINES FOR CRACKS. READING SAE CODE P2173 WAS DETERMINED THAT CODE AND SUBSEQUENT LIMP MODE WAS DESIGNED TO PREVENT DAMAGE TO THE PLASTIC INTAKE MANIFOLD. IT WORKED.*DT CONSUMER STATED THE REASON FOR GASKET NOT SEALING, BLOW BY-GASES FROM ONE CYLINDER TO ANOTHER. CYLINDER HEAD WAS CHECK AND PLASTIC INTAKE FOR WARPING, THEY WERE FINE. Vehicle was just inspected and passed PA State Emissions and is performing properly since the repairs.  The PCV valve is still suspected as the culprit to the failures, and they have been difficult to procure in the secondary market, except OEM. Consumer still replacing the valve at 20K miles just to be sure it does not fail in service.*JB",

ONCE I HAD ENTERED MY NEIGHBORHOOD, I TOOK A TURN, THEN ANOTHER IMMEDIATE TURN GOING ABOUT 3 MILES PER HOUR DUE TO ROAD CONDITIONS. MY TURN WAS SLOW AND WIDE AND  I HIT A PATCH OF BLACK ICE AND BEGAN TO GLIDE TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROAD, ABOUT 15 FEET BUMPING INTO THE CURB. MY ENTIRE FRONT DRIVER-SIDE AXEL HAD COMPLETELY SNAPPED AND MY REAR AXEL HAD BENT. BOTH TIRES WERE COMPLETELY INTACT AND THE WHEELS WERE NOT EFFECTED AS WELL. THE FRONT DRIVER SIDE HAD BASICALLY BEEN COMPLETE SNAPPED AND TORN OUT OF THE SOCKET. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR THIS EQUIPMENT TO COLLAPSE AND FAIL AT SUCH A LOW SPEED IMPACT. I HAD ALSO BEEN DENIED AND INSPECTION FROM THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP THAT I HAD BOUGHT IT FROM AND HAD IT TOWED TO. THEY HAD ALSO NEGLECTED TO REPORT IT TO THE MANUFACTURER UPON OUR REQUEST, LEAVING ME TO REPORT IT FOR THEM. THE DEALERSHIP THEN  THREATENED TO MOVE THE CAR AFTER THE JEEP CORPORATION ORDERED THEM NOT TO.  THE JEEP CORPORATION HAD ALSO STATED THAT THEY WOULD INSPECT THE VEHICLE AS SOON AS THEY COULD, POSSIBLE THIS WEEK OF 01/12/2015. I AM REQUESTING NOTIFICATION IMMEDIATELY.  *TR",
