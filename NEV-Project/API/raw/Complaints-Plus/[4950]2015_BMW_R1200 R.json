        "summary": "THE 2015 R1200R WAS PURCHASED BRAND NEW WITH 0 MILES. AT APPROXIMATELY 750 MILES THE OEM BATTERY WOULD NOT HOLD A CHARGE. THE BIKE WAS BROUGHT IN AND THE BATTERY WAS REPLACED. UPON ARRIVAL TO PICK UP MY BIKE IT DID NOT TURN OVER ON THE FIRST TRY. THE SECOND START WAS UNEVENTFUL AND NO OTHER ISSUES WERE OBSERVED. AFTER THIS, APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE COLD STARTS RESULTED IN THE SAME ISSUE. WHETHER THE STARTER WAS ENGAGED FOR ONLY A COUPLE OF SECONDS OR LONGER IT WOULD NOT START. SUBSEQUENT STARTS WORK AS DESIGNED.     THE BIKE HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO THE DEALER MULTIPLE TIMES WITH NO FIX BY THE BMW CORPORATION. A SECONDARY PROBLEM WAS ALSO DISCOVERED. THE BIKE'S ELECTRONICS ARE SUPPOSE TO DETECT WHEN THE ENGINE DOES NOT START AND DISENGAGE THE STARTER AUTOMATICALLY. THIS FUNCTION IS NOT WORKING. MY DEALER'S TECH ADVISED ME THEY THINK THIS IS SUPPOSE TO OCCUR.    THIS PROBLEM WAS FIRST NOTICED JUNE 19TH OF 2015. THE DEALER WAS ADVISED A COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER TO OBSERVE THE PROBLEM. THIS HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED AS OF THIS TIME.    ALSO, THE LIQUID COOLED BOXER ENGINE THAT HAS BEEN IN THE GS FLEET AND NOW THE RT AND RS FLEETS ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING THE PROBLEM AS WELL.",
