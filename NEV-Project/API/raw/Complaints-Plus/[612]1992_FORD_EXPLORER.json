I TOOK THE VEHICLE HOME ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2002, SATURDAY AFTERNOON AFTER BUYING IT AND ON SUNDAY (9/15) WITH MY WIFE IN THE CAR, THE VEHICLE STARTED HESITATING/JERKING AND FINALLY STALLED OUT WHILE DRIVING DOWN A COUNTRY ROAD.  IT SEEMED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT GETTING ANY GAS.  I WAS ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE STARTED AGAIN AND I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO BE CHECKED AND WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE FIXED.  I RECEIVED A CALL FROM FUTURE FORD TELLING ME THAT I SHOULD ONLY FILL THE GAS TANK  FULL TO AVOID PROBLEMS.  I INFORMED THE FUTURE FORD REPRESENTATIVE THAT THIS WAS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE OPTION FOR A BRAND NEW VEHICLE.    I HAVE TAKEN THIS VEHICLE BACK TO FUTURE FORD 6+ TIMES FOR THE SAME PROBLEM AND IN EACH CASE IT WAS NOT FIXED, OR IT CANNOT BE FIXED.  ONE TIME THIS LAST SUMMER IN 100+ DEGREE HEAT, MY WIFE AND I STOPPED AT A SHOPPING MALL.  WHEN WE STARTED TO LEAVE THE MALL, THE VEHICLES AIR-CONDITIONING WOULD NOT WORK, AS WE STARTED DRIVING IT STARTED HESITATING AND THEN BLACK SMOKE WAS COMING OUT THE TAIL PIPE AND IT WAS JERKING VIOLENTLY.  I WAS CLOSE TO THE DEALERSHIP AND I IMMEDIATELY DROVE IT TO THE DEALER.  FUTURE FORD DEALERSHIP STATES THEY ARE UNABLE TO FIND ANYTHING WRONG, BUT THEY HAVE REPLACED PARTS THEY THOUGHT WERE CAUSING THE PROBLEM AND OTHER ITEMS THEY FOUND WRONG.  WHY OR HOW THEY CANNOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE IS BEYOND ME.    THIS VEHICLE HAS STALLED OUT OR HESITATED NUMEROUS TIMES BESIDES THOSE I HAVE TAKEN IT IN FOR.      I HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE TO THIS POINT THAT WHEN IT HESITATES AND/OR STALLS OUT THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN IN THE MIDDLE OF TURNING RIGHT OR LEFT OR HEAVY COMMUTER TRAFFIC.  BECAUSE WHEN IT DIES THERE IS NOT ANY POWER STEERING.  I WILL NOT TAKE IT ON ANY LONG TRIPS BECAUSE I FEEL THAT IT IS NOT SAFE OR DEPENDABLE.  *AK",

WHEN I WENT TO THE DEALER HE INFORMED ME THAT THE TIRE WAS BEYOND THE WARRANTY LIMITATION OF 60,000 MILES AND THAT I WOULD NEED TO PURCHASE A NEW TIRE.  TODAY, SUNDAY AUGUST 26, 2002 A SECOND TIRE THAT I PURCHASED AT THE SAME TIME FROM YOUR DEALER BEGAN TO FALL APART AT THE TREAD AS I RETURNED FROM CHURCH.  I HAVE TWO MORE DUNLOP TIRES THAT I PURCHASED THAT I AM NOW AFRAID TO DRIVE ON BECAUSE OF THE TREAD PROBLEM.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT EVEN THOUGH WE SURPASS THE MILEAGE LIMITATION WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT THE TIRES TO DISINTEGRATE.  I NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY.  I WILL BE GOING TO THE DEALER TOMORROW AUGUST 26, 2002 AND I BELIEVE THAT ALL FOUR OF THE DEFECTIVE TIRES SHOULD BE REPLACED AT NO CHARGE.

I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BOTH TIMES (GUARDIAN ANGEL MUST HAVE BEEN WATCHING OUT FOR ME).  I LOOKED FOR A FLAT, AND DID NOT SEE ONE, SO I PROCEEDED TO DRIVE AWAY, WHEN THE NOISE WAS MUCH LOUDER (METAL AGAINST METAL).  WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE VEHICLE, THE RIGHT REAR WHEEL (SAME WHEEL BOTH TIMES) WAS ON A DIAGONAL.  ALL OF THE LUG NUTS WERE SEVERED OFF AND THE WHEEL CAME OFF WITH JUST A PULL.  THE SECOND TIME THIS OCCURRED (2/11/2002) I DID REPORT IT TO FORD AND TO MY INSURANCE COMPANY.  I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS NOT HAPPEN TO SOMEONE ELSE, WHO MAY NOT BE AS LUCKY AS I WAS.  WHENEVER I HAVE MY CAR SERVICED ON A REGULAR BASIS.  I HAD NEW BRAKES INSTALLED IN 7/2002, AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THAT MY WHEEL HAD BEEN WORKED ON.  I HAD MY WHEELS CHECKED AFTER A FEW DAYS, AS I HAVE ALUMINUM RIMS.  EVERYTHING WAS FINE, NOT TOO TIGHT, ETC.  HAS THIS ISSUE EVER BEEN BROUGHT UP TO YOU??  THANK YOU FOR ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE IN THIS REGARD!  I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE VEHICLE PRIOR TO MY PURCHASE IN 9/1998.  *AK",

THE POLICE DID COME TO THE SITE AND I WAS NOT CITED FOR THE INCIDENT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY TO AVOID THE INCIDENT.

MY CHILDREN HAVE SCRATCHED THEIR ARMS ON THE BROKEN PLASTIC THAT IS LEFT BEHIND AFTER THE DOOR PULL/ARMREST BREAKS OFF.SINCE I HAVE BEEN UNSUCSSFUL IN TRING TO LOCATE A REPLACEMENT I CAN ONLY CONCLUDE THAT THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM. IT MAKES SHUTTING THE FRONT DOORS DIFFICULT AS THERE IS NO PLACE TO GRAB THE DOOR TO CLOSE IT. THIS IS A REAL HASSLE WHEN PARKED ON A HILL OR IT IS WINDY, AS THE ONLY THING TO GRAB IS THE DOOR HANDLE HALF THE TIME THE DOOR DOSENT LATCH FULLY MAKING IN NESSESSARY TO OPEN THE WINDOW AND GRAB THE TOP OF THE WINDOW TO SHUT THE DOOR FULLY, CREATING A SECOND HAZARD BY OPENING UP THE POSSIBILITIES OF BREAKING THE WINDOW. MY CHILDREN AS I MENTIONED HAVE BEEN SCRATCHED BADLY ENOUGH TO DRAW BLOOD ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS,AND MY WIFE HAS RUINED A COUPLE OF SWEATERS BY GETTING THEM SNAGGED ON THE JAGGED PLASTIC. FORD WANTS OVER 100.00 PER DOOR TO REPLACE THEM(I NEED ALL FOUR) AND FRANKLY ICANT AFFORD IT AND DONT THINK I SHOULD HAVE TO.     THANK YOU.  *AK",
