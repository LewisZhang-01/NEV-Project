        "summary": "The Gen III hemi has an inherent design flaw in which the rollers making contact with the camshaft will fail, causing damage to the camshaft and causing the engine to misfire. This is due to the camshaft being moved away from the crankshaft as it causes oil starvation. After extensive research it appears to affect cars of various miles and workload. There is no single cause that makes this happen other than a grievous design flaw. The main complaint is that you experience total power loss at higher revs, making it dangerous to drive on the interstate or attempting to merge into traffics as the engine begins to shudder and lose most power. Whether it\u2019s 40K miles or 110K miles, the flaw does not discriminate. After numerous attempts to reach Chrysler technical service on how to prevent this, I\u2019ve been ignored and case numbers deleted.   Now this is very important. This causes a misfire which not only destroys catalytic converters, but arrives with no notice. It\u2019s very possible someone may be attempting to pass someone on the interstate and suddenly lose power.   My mechanic inspected it and confirmed that the rollers failed, causing causing lifters to not make proper clearance.  This needs to be investigated as this engine is in millions of cars. And even if 1% of these failure occur on an interstate, the potential for fatalities is absolutely nothing to ignore.   I kindly ask that this matter be investigated. As not everyone can afford the 5K to fix this problem like I can. And due to its high prevalence in trucks, this could cause those who use their trucks for work to be put in a tight spot.   I understand normal wear and tear, but by no means should a cam and valve train fail this soon in a car.   Giving the Gen III hemi by Chrysler and their infamous timing chain defect, I believe this is also a dangerous flaw and something Chrysler ignored. Hoping it would outlast warranties.   Best regards.",

A MAN CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE & ASKED ME WAS I OK. I TOLD HIM WHAT HAPPENED & LET HIM KNOW MY HUSBAND WAS ON THE WAY. WHEN MY HUSBAND GOT THERE, HE GOT ME CALMED DOWN & SAID HE WAS GOING TO TRY TO DRIVE IT CAUTIOUSLY TO THE DEALER. I FOLLOWED HIM IN HIS CAR (TOYOTA) & WE MADE IT TO THE DEALER WITHOUT ANY OTHER INCIDENT. WE CALLED CHRYSLER CORPORATION & THEY OPENED UP A CASE FILE (29522357) TRYING TO GET INFORMATION FROM CHRYSLER, MY HUSBAND LEFT MULTIPLE MESSAGES FOR THEM TO GET THE STATUS ON THIS. HE FINALLY GOT THEM & THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM & THEY WERE CLOSING THE CASE. I WAS CHARGED 130.00 FROM THE DEALER FOR DIAGNOSTIC TEST.

I ASKED IF IT WAS ON FIRE AND CAUTIONED HIM TO GET BACK AND TO LET IT COOL DOWN.  HE LET IT COOL DOWN AND ATTEMPTED TO RESTART THE CAR.  THE CAR HAD NO ELECTRICAL POWER AT THIS TIME.  DOOR LOCKS AND TRUNK LATCH WOULD NOT FUNCTION.  AFTER PUTTING THE KEY IN THE IGNITION AND REALIZING THE CAR WAS COMPLETELY DEAD HE ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE THE KEY FROM THE IGNITION AND THE CAR WOULD NOT RELEASE THE KEY, THEREFORE HE WAS FORCED TO LEAVE THE KEY IN THE CAR UNATTENDED AND EVENTUALLY TOWED FOR SERVICE.  I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THIS SITUATION GIVEN THAT IF HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXIT QUICKLY THE CAR COULD HAVE CAUGHT FIRE OR COMPLETELY LOST POWER/CONTROL WHILE HE WAS STUCK IN THE ROADWAY.

THE ENGINE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED FUNCTIONING AND I LOST ALL POWER TO THE VEHICLE. I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY STOP THE VEHICLE ON THE SHOULDER OF THE INTERSTATE WITHOUT INCIDENT. I TRIED RESTARTING THE ENGINE, WHICH JUST CAUSED THE STARTER TO RUN FOR 5+ SECONDS BEFORE TURNING OFF THE START SEQUENCE (PUSH BUTTON START). THE DEALERSHIP SAID THE CAUSE HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE A SNAPPED TIMING CHAIN AND BROKEN PLASTIC CHAIN GUIDE. THIS IS A 2010 5.7L MDS AUTO TRANSMISSION CHALLENGER. DODGE'S RESPONSE IS TO REPLACE THE CHAIN AND GUIDE AND SEE IF THAT ENABLES THE ENGINE TO RUN. THIS IS AN INTERFERENCE FIT ENGINE WHICH WILL MEAN SEVERAL VALVES WILL HAVE STRUCK THE PISTON HEADS AS A RESULT OF THE TIMING CHAIN BREAKING. IN ADDITION, THE VALVE HEADS AND PISTON HEADS MAY HAVE SUSTAIN ADDITIONAL DAMAGE. THE DEALERSHIP HAD RECOMMENDED TO DODGE A COMPLETE ENGINE REPLACEMENT. WHILE, I FIND DODGE'S SOLUTION TO BE WHOLE INAPPROPRIATE, THE FAILURE OF THE CHAIN IS OF MORE CONCERN. APPROXIMATELY 40 OCCURRENCES OF THIS HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED AT HTTP://WWW.CHALLENGERTALK.COM/FORUMS/F188/TIMING-CHAIN-FAILURE-DODGE-CHALLENGER-69216/ WITH NO SOLUTION BEING PRESENTED BY DODGE TO STOP THE GUIDES FROM BREAKING AND THUS THE CHAINS SNAPPING. DODGE'S INABILITY TO ADEQUATELY AND PREEMPTIVELY ADDRESS THIS SITUATION WILL RESULT IN MORE INSTANCES OF CHALLENGERS BEING DISABLED WHILE TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED ON A CROWDED INTERSTATE, SUCH AS I-75/85 THROUGH ATLANTA. I AM LUCKY MY INCIDENT DID NOT OCCUR DURING HEAVY RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC WHICH MAY HAVE RESULTED IN AN ACCIDENT, INJURY, OR WORSE.  *TR",

IN MY OPINION, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE FRONT BRAKE ROTORS PROVIDED ON THIS CAR ARE INFERIOR AND NOT CAPABLE OF STOPPING THE CAR UNDER NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME (PAST THE 12,000 MILE WARRANTY COVERAGE). AS A RESULT, MY CAR IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE DUE TO THE UNCONTROLLABLE VIBRATIONS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND EXTENSIVE TIME/DISTANCE NEEDED TO STOP THE VEHICLE. THIS SEEMS NOT TO BE THE CASE WITH THE SRT MODEL WHICH USES THICKER ROTORS.  I IMPLORE YOUR ORGANIZATION INVESTIGATE THIS SERIOUS SAFETY DEFECT IN THE SE AND R/T DODGE CHALLENGER MODELS ASAP.

I WENT MY LOCAL DEALER SAN MARCOS DODGE AND MADE THEM AWARE OF  THIS ISSUE AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY 'ALL\" COME FROM DODGE THAT WAY. THEY PROCEEDED TO SHOW ME ANOTHER NEW 2010 DODGE CHALLENGER STR8 WITH THE SAME ISSUE. I CALLED CHRYSLER AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT EITHER THAT'S JUST THE WAY THEY COME. I WENT TO A DODGE FORUM AND SINCE MY POSTING ON FEB THE 11TH I NOW HAVE FOUND   SEVERAL OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. THIS SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE MANUFACTURES WARRANTY UNDER DEFECTS IN MATERIAL WORKMANSHIP. THE SAFETY ISSUE IS IF THIS HEADLINER DROPS INTO  THE REAR WINDOW AREA AND WE LOSE SIGHT OF TRAFFIC A POTENTIAL ACCIDENT COULD TAKE PLACE POSSIBLY FATAL BECAUSE I DO ALOT OF HIGHWAY DRIVING IN AUSTIN TX TO SAN MARCOS TX TO GO TO WORK DAILY. THERE ARE NUMEROUS LARGE TRUCKS I MUST NAVIGATE DAILY AROUND. PLEASE CHECK INTO THIS SINCE I SEEM TO HAVE LITTLE RECOURSE WITH THE DEALER OR THE CHRYSLER CORPORATION. *TR",
