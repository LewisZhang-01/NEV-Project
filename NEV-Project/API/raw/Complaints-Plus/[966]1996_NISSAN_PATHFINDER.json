THE VEHICLE SUBSEQUENTLY FLIPPED ROLLING INTO A CAR DEALERSHIP AND CAUSING DAMAGE TO 2 USED VEHICLES ON THE LOT BEFORE LANDING ON ITS TOP AND SPINNING AROUND. LUCKILY, I ONLY SUFFERED MINOR INJURIES SUCH AS CUTS BRUISES AND MUSCLE STRAIN RESULTING FROM BROKEN GLASS, SEAT BELT PRESSURE, LOOSE OBJECTS FLYING THROUGH THE VEHICLE AND THE JOSTLING AS THE VEHICLE MADE ITS JOURNEY.   I WAS CHARGED WITH REASONABLE CONTROL AND THE ACCIDENT WAS BRUSHED OFF DUE TO MY AGE (19) AND BEING AN 'INEXPERIENCED DRIVER' EVEN THOUGH I EXPLAINED TO EVERYONE THAT THE STEERING SEEMED TO HAVE 'A MIND IF ITS OWN'. I AM NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF DAMAGE CAUSED TO THE 2 VEHICLES ON THE CAR LOT. AFTER HAVING MY VEHICLE TOWED, THE OWNER OF THE TOWING COMPANY URGED ME TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH THE SUV. I SENT IT TO THE RECYCLERS AS I HAD NO OTHER IDEAS ON WHAT TO DO WITH IT AT THIS POINT. I AM NOW READING STORIES OF OTHER ISSUES WITH SIMILAR VEHICLES AS WELL AS SEEING NOTICE OF A RECALL IN THE STRUT TOWER HOUSING. I DO LIVE IN A STATE THAT WAS PART OF THE RECALL BUT WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM PRIOR TO MY ACCIDENT. I HAD ALSO JUST PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE (MY 1ST) IN JULY 2011.

ONE OF THEM WAS \"UNUSUAL TIRE WEAR\" WHICH MANY PATHFINDERS HAD HAD PROBLEMS WITH.  THE LETTER SAID THAT IF MY TIRES SHOWED THIS UNUSUAL WEAR THAT THE TIRES WOULD BE REPLACED.  AT THE TIME GARRAND'S TOLD ME THAT MY TIRES WERE FINE, BUT LESS THAN 2 MONTHS LATER I WAS TOLD BY A LOCAL TIRE DEALERSHIP THAT MY TIRES WERE RUINED, AND BADLY IN NEED OF REPLACEMENT. THE LETTER FROM NISSAN ALSO CONTAINED A \"REPLACEMENT PAGE\" TO THE OWNER'S MANUAL, ON WHICH IT RECOMMENDED THAT THE TIRES NOW BE ROTATED EVERY 2,500 MILES FROM NOW ON! ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO I STARTED TO HEAR A LOUD BANGING NOISE COMING FROM THE FRONT SUSPENSION OF MY PATHFINDER WHENEVER I HIT A BUMP.  I BROUGHT THE PATHFINDER TO GARRANDS AND THEY TOLD ME THAT MY RIGHT FRONT STRUT WAS LEAKING AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $775.  I WANTED A SECOND OPINION, SO I BROUGHT MY PATHFINDER TO A MIDAS DEALER AND FOUND OUT THAT THE NOISE WAS IN FACT COMING FROM THE SWAY BAR STABALIZER LINK AND NOT THE STRUT.  WHEN I QUESTIONED GARRANDS ABOUT THIS LATER THEY TOLD ME THAT THE STABALIZER LINK IS PART OF THE STRUT, AND THEY HAVE TO BE REPLACED TOGETHER.  I SENT A LONG LETTER TO NISSAN IN WHICH I DESCRIBED IN DETAIL THE PROBLEMS THAT I HAVE HAD WITH MY PATHFINDER.  A MONTH LATER WHEN I HEARD NOTHING BACK FROM THEM, I CALLED NISSAN AGAIN AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY WOULD NOT REPLACE THE STRUTS OR THE STABALIZER LINK.  I WAS TOLD \"IT IS RUBBER, YA KNOW!  RUBBER WEARS OUT.\"  I HAVE HEARD THAT PATHFINDERS HAVE ACQUIRED A REPUTATION FOR RUINING TIRES AND STRUT FAILURE. MY PATHFINDER HAS 44000 MILES AND NEEDS NEW STRUTS AGAIN!
