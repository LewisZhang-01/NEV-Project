THE MOTOR STARTED MAKING A NOISE FROM UNDER THE HOOD. I PULLED INTO AN OVERLOOK AND STOPPED AS SOON AS I STOPPED FLAMES SHOT OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD IMMEDIATELY BURNING OFF THE PAINT WHEN I TRIED TO OPEN THE HOOD IT WAS TO HOT TO GET UP. I TRIED TO USE MY FIRE EXTINGUISHER THROUGH THE CRACK I HAD AVAILABLE TO PUT OUT THE FIRE. IF I COULD HAVE GOTTEN THE HOOD UP I BELIEVE I COULD HAVE PUT OUT THE FIRE. IN ABOUT 3 MINUTES THE FIRE WAS SO LARGE IT CAME THROUGH THE FIRE WALL AND CONSUMED THE MOTORHOME. I AND MY PARTNER MANAGED TO ESCAPE THE MOTORHOME WITH OUR DOG , IMPORTANT PAPERS, AND OUR MEDICATIONS BEFORE THE SMOKE DROVE US OUT. THE MOTOR HOME BURNED TO THE GROUND. *TR",
