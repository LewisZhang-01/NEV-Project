AS I CONTINUED SLOWLY BACK TOWARD THE ENTRANCE, I FELT MY VEHICLE  ACCELERATE VIOLENTLY TOWARD THE GROUP OF PEDESTRIANS. ENGAGING THE BRAKE PEDAL WITH BOTH FEET, I GRADUALLY BROUGHT MY VEHICLE UNDER CONTROL AND CONTINUED TO A SAFE STOP WHERE I SHUT OFF THE IGNITION. IT WAS A TERRIFYING FEELING TO FEEL THE SURGE OF POWER THAT I WAS BARELY ABLE TO CONTROL AND TO REALIZE THAT WITH THE PEOPLE WALKING IN FRONT OF ME I COULD HAVE INJURED OR KILLED SOMEONE.  THE PEOPLE WERE ONLY ABOUT 30 FEET IN FRONT OF ME.  I CALLED MY HUSBAND TO COME PICK UP MY MOTHER AND ME AS I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE THE CAR.    I REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO MY TOYOTA DEALER WHO SCHEDULED AN INSPECTION.   THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT, AFTER CLASSIFYING THE INCIDENT AS 'UNINTENDED ACCELERATION', PROCEEDED TO CLEAN THE THROTTLE BODY, CLEAN THE FUEL INJECTORS, AND DE-CARBON THE COMBUSTION CHAMBERS.     THE THROTTLE BODY HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SERVICED AT 45,900 MILES, (AN INTERVAL OF 43,240 MILES).  A SERVICE INTERVAL OF 50,000 MILES IS RECOMMENDED BY THE TOYOTA DEALER.  ALTHOUGH THERE WAS POTENTIAL FOR GREAT HARM TO PEDESTRIANS, THIS WAS THE ONLY INCIDENT OF UNINTENDED ACCELERATION THAT WE EXPERIENCED WITH THIS CAR DURING THE FOUR YEARS THAT I OWNED IT.   ON FEB 13, 2008, I SOLD THE VEHICLE. *TR",

AFTER TWO WEEKS OF OWNING MY CAR I ASKED HIM IF HE HAD A FOUL ODOR IN HIS CAR AS I DID,  HE SAID, \"YES.\"  WE PURSUED THE CAUSE TOGETHER.  CALLED TOYOTA IN TORRANCE, CA, AND A WOMEN ADMITTED THAT THE ODOR WAS COMING FROM THE A/C.  SHE STATED IT COULD GO AWAY BY ITSELF OR TO MINIMIZE THE ODOR, RUN THE A/C ON OUTSIDE AIR.  CALLED SPARKS TOYOTA SERVICE DEPARTMENT, THEY STATED IT COULD BE A CLOGGED OR RESTRICTED CONDENSATION LINE.  WE BOTH HAD OUR CARS CHECKED OUT, NO PROBLEM WAS FOUND WITH THE DRAIN LINES.  BOTH CARS WERE SPRAYED WITH A BACTERIAL DEODORANT.  SERVICE MANAGER RECOMMENDED TO HAVE FACTORY REPRESENTATIVE TROY HEWEL LOOK AT ONE OF OUR CARS TO MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE ODOR.  WE COMPLIED.  HEWEL AT FIRST DID NOT KNOW OF ANY PROBLEM, BUT DURING OUR CONVERSATION HE PRODUCED MATERIAL FROM HONDA/ARTICLES FROM USA TODAY/AUTOMOTIVE NEWS AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKLEY WELLNESS LETTER ABOUT ISSUES WITH A/C EVAPORATORS.  BOTH OF US AGREED TO HAVE OUR EVAPORATORS REPLACED, AS SUGGESTED BY THE HEWEL.  TO THE BOTH OF US IT SEEMS TO BE AN INDUSTRY PROBLEM.  WHY ISN'T THE BUYER INFORMED OF THE ODOR AT PURCHASE?  WHY IN THIS CASE, DOES TOYOTA AT FIRST DENY THAT THERE IS AN A/C PROBLEM, BUT WHEN QUESTIONED FURTHER, ADMITS THERE IS?  WHAT HEALTH RISKS ARE INVOLVED FOR DRIVER AND PASSENGERS?  ISN'T THERE ALSO AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN, BY USING FRESH AIR (INSTEAD OF RECIRCULATION) TO COOL THE CAR, MORE FUEL HAS TO BE BURNT, RAISING THE POLLUTENT LEVELS ADMITTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE?   WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM NHTSA ON THESE ISSUES, THANK YOU! *AK",
