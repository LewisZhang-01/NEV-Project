My car was broken into and the front window was broken, but the app failed to inform me of that!  About a month ago, I left home and all of the lights on the dash started flashing.  The engine temperature was rising (according to the temperature gauge), and then the gauges stopped functioning.  The tachometer showed 0 RPMs and I was unable to see the odometer, temperature, or even my speed.  After disconnecting and reconnecting the battery cables, it appeared to solve the problem.

About 2 months ago I noticed the vehicle would jump from 2 to 3 RPM. He changed the spark plugs and battery. The drive improved but soon started revving again. In September, I called the dealership & described the issue & noted that there was no check engine light or any light indicating anything was wrong. The maintenance personnel said to drop it off for further diagnosis. On October 15, I took the vehicle in for a diagnostic it came back with another clean report and was advised to bring it back in if the problem persist. The next morning, I noticed the vehicle was still behaving the same way. I called the dealership and told them I will bring the vehicle back in. I was insistent on finding out what the problem was & showed them a video of what I was describing the vehicle was doing. The dealership said they would keep it overnight to try & figure out what was wrong. The following evening October 21, I got a call stating that my transmission fluid was black with metal shavings and it was supposed to be red. The transmission fluid could no longer be changed at this point but instead the entire transmission needed to be replaced for $8,947.95! Keep in mind that the average cost of changing the transmission fluid is $250. If my vehicle was properly maintained when took it to Toyota dealerships since 2014 for ALL the recommended maintenance, we would not be having this issue. We TRUSTED the dealerships to tell us what maintenance was needed. The transmission fluid should have been replaced at 60,000 miles & it was not. Now we have to replace the entire transmission. Toyota needs to take ownership of their mistake; not properly maintaining our vehicle. It is no fault of our own that it was never indicated to us that the transmission fluid needed to be replaced.

I tried to call my wife to advise her I was having car problems which is surprising as I haven't had issues previously and had an earlier version of the RAV4 that I drove for 210,000 miles. Anyway, another vehicle stopped alongside and inquired if I needed assistance.  As I talked, I noticed a smokey smell from what I had initially assumed was steam.  I stepped outside the vehicle and observed through the drivers side front wheel well to see fire at the bottom of the engine compartment. Since I was driving to trails to ride my mountain bike, I had a water bottle and squeezed it onto the flames which partially extinguished and then relit. I hit the hood release but decided it was better to leave the hood down.  I went to the rear lift gate to open it to retrieve my expensive carbon fiber mountain bike but it was locked.  I tried to open the back driver side door also without success and tried hitting the unlock button on the drivers door but there was no power. About this time the smoke coming from the hood increased and I decided to heed the advise being given to step away from the car.  Had I remembered sooner, I probably could have reached around the driver's seat to recover my wallet from the back pocket of the seat.  As the fire increased, I stepped increasingly further back from the vehicle. About 5 minutes into the fire a state trooper arrived and expended his only extinguisher in an unsuccessful attempt to put out the fire. It was probably another 12-15 minutes before the fire department arrived to extinguish the fire but by that time, the car and its contents were a total loss.",

SPONTANEOUS SUNROOF BREAKAGE) THAT SOUNDED LIKE A LARGE OBJECT CRASHED INTO OUR 2014 TOYOTA RAV4, OR AN OR AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED RIGHT OVER OUR HEADS. MY GIRLFRIEND IMMEDIATELY ASKED 'WAS IT A BLOW OUT', AND I RESPONDED NO BECAUSE THANKFULLY, I HAD 100% CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE AND DID NOT SWERVE OR BRAKE OR FEEL ANY MECHANICAL ISSUES BUT, APPARENTLY LET OFF THE GAS AND WAS SLOWING DOWN. THEN, THE DRIVER OF A PICK-UP TRUCK OVERPASSING US ON THE RIGHT GAVE US DIRTY LOOKS AND WAVED TO US LIKE WE NEEDED TO PULL OVER. WE EXITED ON THE NEXT EXIT (S. ACADIANA THROUGHWAY). THE SUNROOF VISOR WAS THANKFULLY CLOSED, AND UPON OPENING IT UP WE NOTICED THE CONVEX CRATER-LIKE SHATTERED SUNROOF, AND IMMEDIATELY SHUT IT WHEREUPON WE TOO NOTICED THE EXCESSIVE NOISE DUE TO WIND CONTACTING THE OPENING. THE SUNROOF EXPLODED OUTWARD, WITH A CONVEX, VOLCANO-LIKE CRATER, AND THOUSANDS OF STRESS CRACKS WITH HUNDREDS OF LITTLE GLASS SHARDS EVERYWHERE AROUND THE OPENING. THIS OCCURRED IN THE CENTER, WITH ABOUT  OF THE TOTAL SUNROOF SURFACE AREA MISSING (EJECTED).  THIS OCCURRED ON SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 2018 TRAVELLING ROUGHLY 65MPH ALONG I-10 IN BATON ROUGE, LEFT-HAND LANE, WESTBOUND NEAR THE MERGER OF I-12, DURING LIGHT RAIN, NO VEHICLES IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF ME, SMOOTH SURFACES, NO CONSTRUCTION IN VICINITY, WITH NO OVERHEAD LAMPS OR OVERPASSES. WIDE OPEN DIVIDED HIGHWAY. TEMPERATURE WAS 76F, PER CAR.",

NOT SURE IF ELECTRICAL PROBLEM OR WHAT SO TOOK IT IN TO DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME I SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO PAY $50-60 TO REBOOT IT.  THEY CHECKED THE BATTERY AND SAID THE BATTERY WAS LOW CHARGE AND REPLACED IT AT NO CHARGE BUT SAID THEY WERE UNABLE TO REBOOT THE SYSTEM BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT STAY UP LONG ENOUGH BEFORE IT WOULD BLACK OUT AGAIN.  SINCE IT WAS BARELY PAST THE WARRANTY PERIOD TOYOTA WOULD NOT COVER THE SYSTEM AND I WOULD HAVE TO PAY $1000 TO HAVE REFURBISHED SYSTEM INSTALLED.  AFTER RESEARCHING ONLINE I FOUND THIS WAS A COMMON COMPLAINT AND FOUND ONE HERE AT THIS SITE AS WELL SO ADDING MINE.  I SENT LETTERS AND EMAILS TO TOYOTA TO STAND BEHIND THEIR LONG TIME CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCTS BUT THEY WOULD NOT BUDGE.  MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS SHOULD NOT FAIL AFTER 3 YEARS.  I CALL THAT A DEFECT BUT I GUESS BECAUSE IT IS NOT CONSIDERED A SAFETY ISSUE IT IS NOT IMPORTANT TO TOYOTA. WE ARE A TOYOTA FAMILY AND HAVE BEEN DRIVING TOYOTA'S SINCE MY FIRST CAR BACK IN THE 70'S.  I WILL PROBABLY GO AHEAD AND REPLACE WITH REFURBISHED SYSTEM HOPING THIS IS NOT AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE AND REPEAT BUT I WILL CERTAINLY RECONSIDER BEFORE PURCHASING ANOTHER TOYOTA IN THE FUTURE.",

FORTUNATELY SINCE I WAS TAKING A TURN I WAS HARDY AT A SPEED OF ABOUT 10 MPH AND HENCE MY FRONT RIGHT PASSENGER SIDE DOOR & HEAD LIGHT ETC. GOT DAMAGED AND THERE WAS A VERY MINIMAL DAMAGE TO THE FRONT FENDER ON THE DRIVER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE BEHIND OUR RAV4. FOR THE SAME REASON NONE OF US - EITHER MYSELF, MY FRONT CO-PASSENGER OR THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE BEHIND OUR RAV4 WERE PHYSICALLY HURT AND WERE VERY SAFE AFTER THIS INCIDENT. THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE BEHIND OUR RAV4 INFORMED THAT HE HEARD A KIND OF STRANGE SOUND AND SAW OUR RAV4 REVERSING & TURNING RIGHT, AND HE MOVED AWAY INTO THE RIGHT LANE. THE POLICE OFFICER, WHO HAS COME ALSO INFORMED THAT SHE HAS COME ACROSS THIS KIND OF INCIDENTS WITH TOYOTA VEHICLES RECENTLY, AND DID NOT GIVE ME CITATION AFTER REVIEWING MY INCIDENT FREE DRIVING RECORD AND ALSO SHE COULD NOT FIND REASON FOR THIS FREAK INCIDENT WHICH LOOKS MORE LIKE A MECHANICAL DEFECT OF MY RAV4, AND ADVISED TO TAKE TO TOYOTA DEALER FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION & RESOLUTION. ON FURTHER RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS RECALL - \"ELECTRICAL POWER ASSIST SYSTEM\" (EPS) FOR 2014 RAV4 WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED & DOCUMENTED BY TOYOTA ON 03/13/2015 BUT WAS NOT NOTIFIED TO THE CUSTOMERS. WE HAVE CONTACTED TOYOTA COMPANY, COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS INCIDENT, INFORMED THE RECALL AND WE ARE WAITING FOR A RESPONSE FROM TOYOTA AFTER A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION, COMPUTER DATA ANALYSIS FROM OUR RAV4. I AM HEREWITH ATTACHING THE DOCUMENTATION FOR THE RECALL. I AM VERY MUCH WORRIED & CONCERNED ABOUT THIS INCIDENT, SINCE IT IS OF VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. PLEASE REVIEW AND REPLY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE.  *TR",

I WAS VERY NERVOUS WHEN THIS HAPPENED. MOREOVER, I HAVE LOST CONFIDENCE, TRUST, AND A SENSE OF SAFETY IN THIS VEHICLE. BASICALLY, I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE AND SECURE IN THIS CAR. MY EXPERIENCE YESTERDAY    09/01/2014 WAS TERRIFYING, I WAS AFRAID THAT SOMEBODY WAS GOING TO HIT ME FROM BEHIND. WHEN THE VEHICLE STARTED TO SHUT DOWN I WAS SCARED FOR MY FRIENDS LIFE AND MINE.    I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO STOP THE CAR AS MUCH AS I COULD TO THE SIDE SAFELY AND PUT ON MY HAZARD LIGHTS ON, AND CALL FOR HELP. THERE WAS NO SHOULDER I HAD TO STOP ON A BUSY ROAD, WHERE CARS DRIVE OVER THE SPEED LIMIT.   WHEN I WAS BUYING THE VEHICLE THEY WERE MY BEST BUDDY OFFERING YOU WATER, PIZZA, AFTER THE DEAL SHAKING HANDS  20 TIMES, WHEN YOU GO BACK ITS LIKE WE ARE VERY BUSY.
