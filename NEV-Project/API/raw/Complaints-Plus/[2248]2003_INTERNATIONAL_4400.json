THE FIRST OCCURRED AT 121,000 MILES WHEN AN O-RING ON A CYLINDER SLEEVE FAILED LETTING COOLANT FILL THE CRANKCASE AND REQUIRING A COMPLETE ENGINE OVERHAUL THAT COST US OVER $6,000 DOLLARS. THE TRUCK WAS MORE THAN 3 YEARS OLD SO WE HAD TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS. AFTER PUTTING ONLY 40,000 MILES ON THE REBUILT ENGINE IT HAS THROWN A ROD OUT THE SIDE OF THE BLOCK COMPLETELY RUINING THE ENGINE. IT WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF $16,000. WE HAVE CONTACTED NAVISTAR BECAUSE THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN SAID BOTH FAILURES WERE CAUSED BY POOR WORKMANSHIP, DEFECTIVE MATERIALS, OR FAULTY DESIGN. NAVISTAR HAS REFUSED TO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT. *TR",
