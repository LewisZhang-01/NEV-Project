WE TRIED TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL TO RELEASE ANY PRESSURE, WIGGLED THE STEERING WHEEL, ETC UNTIL FINALLY, THE STEERING WHEEL BECAME LOCKED.  AT THAT POINT, THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WE COULD DO WITH THE VEHICLE.  WE WERE BLOCKING THE DRIVE INTO A GLASS REPAIR SHOP SUCH THAT NO OTHER VEHICLES COULD BE MOVED IN OR OUT OF THE BUSINESS,  NOT TO MENTION THE WEATHER WAS VERY COLD.      WE HAD TO HAVE A TOW COMPANY COME AND RELEASE A LINKAGE UNDERNEATH THE VAN IN ORDER TO GET IT INTO NEUTRAL JUST TO PUSH IT BACK OUT OF THE WAY.  WE HAD IT TOWED TO A DODGE DEALER IN BLOOMINGTON, INDIANA TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT.    THE RESULT WAS A FAULTY IGNITION CYLINDER.  THE DEALER REPLACED IT AT A COST OF NEARLY $300.  AFTER MUCH RESEARCH ONLINE, IT APPEARS THAT THIS IS A WIDE SPREAD PROBLEM ACROSS THE ENTIRE CHRYSLER PRODUCT LINE.  THIS FAULT PUTS A PERSON AT RISK OF BEING STRANDED.

CHRYSLER REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE PROBLEM.    THE CORROSION IS SO SEVERE THAT THE METAL IS PERFORATED AND STARTING TO TEAR. I WORK FOR A COMPANY THAT SELLS ANTI-CORROSION COATING (CALLED ELECTROCOAT) AND KNOW THAT THIS PROBLEM MUST HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS. IF NOT HIDDEN UNDER THE HOOD I WOULD HAVE NOTICED IT LONG BEFORE THE WARRANTY WAS UP. HAD THE PART DESIGN BEEN PROPER AND THE ELECTROCOATING DONE CORRECTLY THIS DEFECT SHOULD NOT OCCUR BEFORE 10 YEARS.    THIS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON PROBLEM WITH MY MODEL. CHRYSLER ISSUED A TSB NUMBER 23-044-02  ACKOWLEDGING THIS PROBLEM FOR VANS BUILT FROM 1996-2000 AND HAS A REPAIR KIT AND PROCEDURE.  IF THE PROBLEM IS IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE WARRANTY PERIOD THE TSB STATES IT IS REIMBURSABLE.

AFTER ABOUT 2 MIN I SAW FIRE DRIPPING FROM MY ENGINE, I GOT MY FIRE EXT. AND USED IT UNDER THE CAR. THEN I OPENED THE HOOD AND PUT OUT THE REST OF THE FIRE.  I THEN DISCONNECTED BOTH BATTERY TERMINALS AND CALLED THE WRECKER TO TOW MY CAR TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR (AUTOWEST DODGE IN ROSEVILLE AUTO MALL--- ROSEVILLE CA) .  I FOLLOWED THE WRECKER TO AUTOWEST AND TOLD THE DEALER TO REPAIR MY CAR.  THEY CALLED &  THE NEXT DAY I PICKED UP MY CAR .  THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A SHORT IN MY STARTER AND THEY HAD PUT IN A NEW STARTER AND REPAIRED THE BURNED UP WIRING HARNESS. MY CAR SEEMS TO BE WORKING OK NOW.  MY EXTENDED WARRANTY COVERED ALL BUT $50.00 .   I AM WRITING THIS REPORT BECAUSE WHAT IF---I HAD DRIVEN INTO THE GARAGE CLOSED THE DOOR AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE ? IT WOULD HAVE BURNED DOWN THE HOUSE OR WORSE.  I ASKED THE DEALER IF THEY HAD ANY OTHER CASES OF THIS AND HE SAID NO. I DO NOT TRUST AUTO DEALERS TO TELL THE TRUTH.

I MANAGED TO GET TO SAFE SPOT OFF THE ROAD AND LOOKING UNDER THE HOOD I DISCOVERED MY WATER PUMP PULLEY WAS OFF AND LAYING ON THE SPLASH PAN. THE SERPENTINE BELT TENSIONER PULLEY HAD ALSO FALLEN OFF AND WAS WHAT I HAD SEEN ROLLING IN THE ROAD.  I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A FIVE STAR CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP IN STONE MOUNTAIN, GA WHERE THE MAINTENANCE SUPERVISOR SAID IT JUST WORE OUT AND HE HAD SEEN THEM FALL OFF IN LESS MILEAGE THAN MINE HAD. I COMPLAINED THAT IT WAS A MANUFACTURES DEFECT AND SHOULD NOT HAVE JUST SUDENLY FALLEN OFF WITH NO WARNING. I WAS LEFT WITH NO CHOICE BUT TO HAVE IT REPAIRED. THEY CHARGED ME JUST UNDER $400.00 TO REPLACE THE WATER PUMP AND PUT A NEW TENSIONER PULLEY ON IT. TOWING COST ME $85.00 AND A RENTAL VEHICLE $79.00. THE DEALER MAINTENANCE SUPERVISOR EVEN HAD THE NERVE TO ASK ME IF I WANTED TO GET A 60000 MILE CHECK UP WHILE THEY WERE WORKING ON IT. I TOLD HIM NO THANKS THE VEHICLE NEVER MADE IT TO 60000 MILES. I HAVE NOT COMPLAINED TO CHRYSLER BECAUSE I FELT I WOULD GET THE SAME COLD TREATMENT THAT I GOT FROM THE DEALERSHIP IN STONE MOUNTAIN WHERE I WAS STRANDED OVER 100 MILES AWAY FROM HOME.

I HAVE HAD SEVERAL VEHICLE WITH OVER 150,000 MILES THAT DID NOT HAVE A COMPRSSOR FAILURE. MY MOTHER HAS A 23 YEAR OLD CAR WITH 250,000+ MILES AND HAS NOT HAD A A/C PROBLEM. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS QUALIFIES AS A DEFECT, BUT MOST FRIENDS I HAVE SPOKEN WITH HAVE NOT HAD THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM WITH SO FEW MILES ON THEIR CAR. THE TOTAL COST TO FIX THE COMPRESSOR WAS $650 +/-.  THE WARRENTY ON THE VAN WAS 3 YEARS/36,000 MILES, EVEN THOUGH THIS IS PAST THE WARRENTY IT STILL SEEMS THAT THIS TYPE OF FAILURE SHOULD NOT OCCUR AT THIS EARLY STAGE IN THE VANS \"LIFE\".  *AK",
