I'M HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED WITH A HONDA AS I'VE HEARD EXCELLENT THINGS ABOUT HONDA CARS WHICH IS WHY I PURCHASED MY ACCORD. IF I HAD KNOWN OF THE ISSUE I WOULDN'T HAVE PURCHASED IT AND I'D RATHER PURCHASE A DIFFERENT CAR THAN TO HAVE TO COME OUT OF POCKET. I DON'T FEEL I HAVE BEEN TREATED PROPERLY THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AND I GABE HONDA THE CHANCE TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT BUT NO ONE IS WILLING TO COOPERATE. I WILL NOT BE PURCHASING A NEW VEHICLE. I EVEN THOUGHT TO TRADE MY VEHICLE IN FOR A 2018 HONDA ACCORD BUT IF I FEEL I'VE BEEN TREATED POORLY WHY WOULD I WANT TO CONTINUE GIVING A COMPANY MY BUSINESS IF I'VE BEEN TREATED POORLY? ALSO MY DAD WAS CONSIDERING PURCHASING A BRAND NEW 2021 HONDA CIVIC BUT NOW I WILL LEAD HIM TO A DIFFERENT BRAND VEHICLE AS HONDA HAS NOT LIVED UP TO ITS NAME. AND NOW TO TOP EVERYTHING OFF, MY MOTOR IS GOING ALL DUE TO THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE HONDA DEALER. IF THEY WOULD HAVE FIXED THE VTC ACTUATOR PROBLEM MY MOTOR WOULDN'T BE CONSUMING SO MUCH OIL AND MY MOTOR WOULD NOT HAVE BLOWN.

SPARK PLUGS 1-4 WERE REPLACED FREE OF CHARGE DUE TO HONDA SERVICE BULLETIN 13-078 WHICH EXTENDED THE WARRANTY TO 8 YEARS ON ENGINE MISFIRES.  MY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE PISTONS AND THE PISTON RINGS WERE NOT INSPECTED AT THAT TIME.  WHY NOT? WHO KNOWS WHAT CONDITION THEY WERE IN?  THE CAR WAS RETURNED TO US WITH SPARK PLUGS AS BAND-AIDS!  IT HAPPENED AGAIN AT 103,000 MILES (WHICH WE PAID FOR) AND NOW AT 128,000 THE DEALERSHIP SAYS WE NEED A COMPLETE LOWER ENGINE REBUILD TO REPLACE PISTONS 1-3.  OF COURSE AS A 2008, EVEN THOUGH LOW MILES, IT'S OUTSIDE OF WARRANTY.  I THOUGHT IN BUYING AN ACCORD, I COULD DRIVE IT FOR AT LEAST 150,000- AT LEAST!  I WOULD LIKE THE WARRANTY FURTHER EXTENDED, OR AT LEAST FOR AMERICAN HONDA CORP TO PAY FOR HALF OF THE REPAIRS AS IT'S ONLY 3,000 MILES OUTSIDE OF THE ORIGINAL SERVICE BULLETIN EXTENDED WARRANTY OF 125,000.  IF HONDA ACKNOWLEDGED SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THIS PARTICULAR V6 VTEC ENGINE, WHY DOES THE WARRANTY EXPIRE?  SHOULDN'T THERE BE A GRACE PERIOD OR A COMPROMISE?  WE ARE GETTING PUNISHED FOR CARING FOR OUR CAR AND HAVING LOW MILES ON IT.  MANY FOLKS BENEFITTED FROM THE EXTENDED WARRANTY BECAUSE THEIR CARS FAILED WITHIN THE 8 YEAR TIME FRAME BECAUSE THEY HAD HIGH MILES- HIGHER THAN OURS!  WHAT ABOUT THOSE 08 ACCORDS THAT ARE STILL FAILING OUTSIDE OF THE 8 YEAR MARK THAT HAVE LOWER MILES THAN THE ONES HONDA COVERED UNDER WARRANTY???  C'MON AMERICAN HONDA, TAKE CARE OF ALL YOUR CUSTOMERS!  I HAVE PURCHASED 6 HONDAS IN MY LIFETIME AND AM A LOYAL CUSTOMER AT MY LOCAL HONDA SERVICE CENTER WITH AN EXTENSIVE SERVICE HISTORY.  ON THIS CAR ALONE I'VE PURCHASED NEW BRAKES, NEW STARTER, NEW ALTERNATOR, DRIVE TRAIN BELTS, WATER PUMP, NEW VTEC SPOOL VALVES, VTEC SOLENOID, AND EVERY SERVICE AS RECOMMENDED BY- AT THE DEALERSHIP- AND MY ACCORD ONLY LASTED 128,000?

THE EXTENDED WARRANTY SAYS..\"IF THE VEHICLE IS EXPERIENCING HIGH OIL CONSUMPTION, CONTACT ANY AUTHORIZED HONDA DEALER FOR AND APPOINTMENT TO HAVE IT INSEPECTED AND, IF NEEDED REPAIRED.  PLEASE PLAN TO LEAVE YOUR VEHICLE AT THE DEALER FOR TWO FULL DAYS TO ALLOW THEM FLEXIBILITY IN SCHEDULING.\" THIS QUOTE IS RIGHT FROM THE WARRANTY. A YEAR LATER AND HONDA WILL NOT HONOR THIS WARRANTY.  WHAT THEY DO IS MAKE THE CAR HAVE A OIL CONSUMPTION TEST. IF THE CAR IS NOT BURNING MORE THAN A QUART IN 1000 MILES THEY SAY ITS NOT A PROBLEM.

AFTER CALLING FOR TWO MORE DAYS AND TALKING WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE, LOCAL DEALER REP STATED THEY CAN DO NOTHING UNTIL NATIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE REVIEWS AND AUTHORIZES LOANER VEHICLE. CALLED NATIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE 7/28/16 TO FOLLOW UP ON REQUEST AS NO WORD FROM CASE MANAGER. WAS ON VACATION THE FOLLOWING WEEK SO NO FOLLOWUP, BUT NO CALL FROM HONDA EITHER. ON 8/8/16 (TWO WEEKS AFTER INITIAL REQUEST), CALLED AGAIN TO FOLLOW UP, DENISE CONFIRMED MY REQUEST IS IN THE ESCALATIONS QUEUE AND TO BE PATIENT.    I FIND IT BEYOND RIDICULOUS THAT HONDA CANNOT STAFF THEMSELVES APPROPRIATELY TO DEAL WITH THIS RECALL SITUATION. EVERY DAY THAT GOES BY, WHILE I WAIT \"PATIENTLY\" IS ANOTHER DAY THAT HONDA OUR FAMILY RISKS INJURY OR DEATH FROM THE AIRBAG IN OUR VEHICLE AND IS ANOTHER DAY THAT HONDA DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR A RENTAL VEHICLE TO ELIMINATE THE RISK OF THAT INJURY/DEATH. HONDA IS GAMBLING THAT OUR VEHICLE, THAT HAS SPENT ITS ENTIRE 8 YEARS OF EXISTENCE IN A PRIORITY (HUMID) LOCATION (FLORIDA), WON'T INJURE OR KILL US IN THE MEANTIME, EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE GONE SO FAR AS TO ADVISE IN WRITING FOR NO ONE TO RIDE IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT.

THE SMOKE CLEARED RAPIDLY, AND LOOKING UNDER THE HOOD, NOTHING SEEMED TO BE AMISS. NO FIRE, NO MORE SMOKE, NO LEAKING FLUIDS, BUT THE ENGINE WAS COMPLETELY DEAD. SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPTS TO RE-START IT PRODUCED ONLY THE CLICK OF THE STARTER - THE ENGINE REFUSED TO TURN OVER.  THE CAR WAS TOWED TO AN AUTO REPAIR SHOP WHERE IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO OIL IN THE ENGINE WHICH HAD CAUSED IT TO SEIZE.   FOR THE PAST 18 MONTHS THE CAR HAS BEEN BURNING QUITE A SIGNIFICANT BIT OF OIL.  DURING THAT PERIOD, IT NEEDED AT LEAST TWO TWO QUARTS OF OIL BETWEEN SCHEDULED OIL CHANGES - THERE NEVER WAS ANY OIL LEAK. TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, IT WAS TOPPED OFF WITH TWO QUARTS OF OIL WHEN THE LOW OIL AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS CAME ON. WHEN THE ENGINE WAS FINALLY OPENED, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE PISTON ROD HAD SNAPPED OFF WHEN THE ENGINE RAN DRY OF OIL (SEE ATTACHED PICTURES).  SUBSEQUENT RESEARCH HAS REVEALED THAT HONDA IS AWARE OF SEVERAL PROBLEMS INVOLVING EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION FOR THIS PARTICULAR ENGINE CONFIGURATION AND MODEL YEAR (2008 3.5L V6 PZEV). I HAVE ALSO DISCOVERED OFFICIAL SEVERAL HONDA SERVICE BULLETINS THAT ARE RELEVANT AND PERTINENT TO THIS ISSUE.

I SPECIFICALLY ASKED THE SERVICE ADVISOR, DARRELL RAEBURN, IF THERE WAS AN AIRBAG RECALL ON THE CAR. HE WASN'T SURE, BUT AFTER CHECKING WITH SOMEONE ELSE, HE SAID YES, THERE WAS BOTH A SOFTWARE AND A HARDWARE RECALL. THEY PERFORMED THE SOFTWARE UPDATE AT THAT TIME, AND HE SAID THE PARTS FOR THE REPAIR SHOULD BE IN IN JULY.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP EARLIER THIS WEEK TO ASK THE STATUS. I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO RECALL ON MY CAR. I SAID THAT WAS NOT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT I HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN TOLD, AFTER WHICH I WAS THEN TOLD THAT THE PARTS WERE DUE IN THE NEXT DAY, AND EVEN THOUGH THERE WASN'T A RECALL THEY COULD REPLACE THE PART FOR ME AT NO CHARGE. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR TODAY (JULY 28), BUT WHEN I GOT THERE, I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE ADVISOR (DAVE?) THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL ON THE CAR AND NOTHING THEY WOULD DO.  I JUST SPOKE ON THE PHONE WITH CRAIG SCELVA, WHO IS SOME TYPE OF TOP SERVICE MANAGER. ASIDE FROM MY COMPLAINT ABOUT THE CONFUSING INFORMATION AND WASTED TIME TODAY, I ASKED HIM WHAT THE REAL STORY IS REGARDING THE CAR AND AIRBAG RECALL. HE SAID THERE IS DEFINITELY NOT A RECALL, THAT ONLY IF THE SRS LIGHT COMES ON IS THERE A RECALL. YET (AS I TOLD HIM), WHEN I ENTER MY VIN NUMBER INTO THE HTTP://HONDAAIRBAGINFO.COM WEBSITE, THE RESULT IS THAT THERE IS A RECALL, NUMBER 16V-056, TO REPLACE THE SRS ECU, WHICH MAY CORRODE AND FAIL (THOUGH IT SAYS THAT IF THE UNIT FAILS THE WARNING LIGHT WILL COME ON).

THE PROBLEM WITH THE LAWSUIT IS THAT AT THAT TIME MOST OWNERS OF THE VEHICLES DID NOT KNOW OR ENCOUNTER A PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKE PADS.  FURTHER, THE PADS ARE WEARING PREMATURELY WHICH IN MOST CASES WILL CAUSE A NEED FOR THE ROTORS TO BE REPLACED.  THUS THE EXPENSE TO THE OWNER IS HIGHER.  IN SOME INSTANCES THE OWNER IS FORCE TO PURCHASE NEW CALIPERS WHICH INCREASE THE COST EVEN MORE.  THE VEHICLES ARE OUTFITTED WITH AN ELECTRONIC BRAKING DISTRIBUTION (EBD) SYSTEM WHICH MIGHT BE THE CAUSE OF THE OVERALL ISSUE.  WHEN THE 2008 HONDA ACCORD MODELS WERE BUILT, HONDA INSTALLED SMALLER BRAKE PADS ON THE VEHICLES.  THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT COVERED A FRACTION OF THE COST TO OWNERS.  AS TIME GOES BY, MORE AND MORE OWNERS ARE NOW FACED WITH MUCH HIGHER COSTS TO REPLACE ALL THE REAR BRAKING COMPONENETS.  I MYSELF SPENT OVER $800.00 IN APRIL, 2014 TO HAVE NEW BRAKE PADS, CALIPERS AND ROTORS INSTALLED ON MY VEHICLE.  THAT SERVICE WAS TO REPLACE THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT ON THE VEHICLE.  I NEED TO HAVE THE SAME BRAKING COMPONENTS REPLACED IN MARCH, 2016 AT A COST OF OVER $800.00.  THE BRAKE COMPONENTS SHOULD NOT NEED TO BE REPLACED AFTER 23 MONTHS.

TOOK THE CAR TO HONDA IN OCT 2015 TO START TEST 1. AFTER THAT THE CAR STARTED ACTING FUNNY. I WOULD JERK ALOT, ENGINE LIGHT WOULD START FLASHING, IT WOULDNT ACCELERATE PROPERLY. IN FEB 2016 IT HAPPENED AGAIN AND I GOT STRANDED BECAUSE THE CAR WOULDNT ACCELERATE. AMERICAN HONDA WOULDNT HONOR THE WARRANTY EXT BECAUSE I WAS OVER THE ALLOWED MILES. THEY KNOW THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THESE MODEL CARS AND HAD ONLY RECENTLY SENT ME A LETTER REGARDING IT. I FOUND OUT THAT A FEW OF THE CYLINDERS WERE MISFIRING AND AFTER RESERACH FOUND OUT IT WAS DUE TO THE RINGS.

I LEFT THE ISSUE, CHANGED MY OWN OIL, BECAUSE, L COULD NOT AFFORD TO HAVE THE OIL CHANGED EVERY 200 MILES. I HAD TO ADD A QUART EVERY 1000 MILES, UNTIL THE LIMIT WAS MEET TO CHANGE THE ENGINE OIL COMPLETELY. BASICALLY L LEFT THE PROBLEM ALONE.   IN AUGUST 2015, L RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HONDA EXTENDING THE WARRANTY TO 125,000 MILES DUE THE AN OIL CONSUMPTION PROBLEM CAUSE BY BAD PISTONS. BASICALLY A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT. I CONTACTED HONDA USA AND WAS TOLD THAT EVEN THOUGH OUT OF WARRANTY, L SHOULD DO A OIL CONSUMPTION TEST. I DID THIS. THE CAR BURNED 2.2 QUARTS IN 1975 MILES. IT WAS DETERMINED BY THE DEALER THAT THE PISTONS NEEDED TO BE REPAIRED.   ON 10-23-15 AT 11:47 AM, HONDA CONTACTED ME AND TOLD ME THAT SINCE MY CAR IS NOW 8000 MILES OUT OF WARRANTY, THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO, AND THE REPAIRS WAS ON ME TO DO AT MY EXPENSE. I FIND THIS TO BE VERY TROUBLESOME SINCE IT IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT L STARTED, BUT IT IS A PROBLEM FROM HONDA, WHEN THE CAR WAS MADE.   I AM VERY UPSET OVER THIS, AND L AM CONTACTING YOU TO SEE IF L HAVE ANY GROUNDS TO FIGHT THIS MATTER. I USE MY CAR FOR WORK, AND L LOVE IN THE SOUTH, AND HAVE TO DRIVE TO WORK EVERY DAY. SO MILEAGE DOES ACCUMULATE. HOWEVER, THIS ISSUE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE HAD HONDA WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THIS PROBLEM EARLIER OR DONE SOMETHING BEFORE THE CARS THAT WERE PURCHASED IN 2008, COULD HAVE BEEN COVERED SINCE THE TIME GOES BACK THE FURTHEST.

JUST RECENTLY, AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF DRIVING AND AFTER ABOUT 1500 MILES AFTER AN OIL CHANGE, MY ENGINE STARTED MAKING A \"PINGING SOUND.\" THEN THE OIL PRESSURE LIGHT STARTED FLASHING. I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER AND TURNED THE ENGINE OFF TO FIND THAT THE OIL (PER THE DIPSTICK) WAS LOW AGAIN!

THE CRANKING NOISE IS SO LOUD THAT MY WIFE AND KIDS ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE CAR SITUATION AND FEEL VERY UNSAFE.  THE NOISE GENERALLY OCCUR WHEN WE START CAR FIRST TIME IN THE MORNING.    WE CONTACTED HONDA MOTORS LAST YEAR AND THEY RECOMMENDED US TO TAKE IT TO DEALERSHIP. WE WENT TO TWO DEALERSHIP AND THEY COULD NOT FIND ANY ISSUE WHEN THEY START CAR FIRST THING IN MORNING. THIS IS VERY UNUSUAL AS WE HAVE BEEN HEARING NOISE EVERY SINGLE MORNING SINCE THAN WHEN WE START CAR FIRST TIME.  WE DO NOT KNOW HOW TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE?     WITH SOME GOOGLE SEARCH I FOUND OUT THAT FAILURE OF VTC IS CAUSING SIMILAR ISSUE TO 2008 HONDA ACCORD MODELS. CAN YOU PLEASE GUIDE US HOW TO RESOLVE THIS MATTER?

THIS IS OUR 7TH HONDA AND NEVER WOULD EXPECT THIS TYPE OF SERVICE OR RELIABILITY ON THIS VEHICLE.   *JS",

REALLY?   THIS IS NOT A 1975 CAR!!   HE SAID THAT THIS WAS WITHIN HONDA SPECS.   MAYBE HONDA MAKE UP A STORY AND STICK WITH IT SPECS BUT THAT IS NOT NORMAL FOR A NEWER CAR!!    I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A FIX FOR 6CYL MODELS BUT HONDA NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE FOR 4CYL MODELS AS WELL.     MY ENGINE COULD HAVE SEIZED ON ME COSTING THOUSANDS TO REPAIR.

I WAS PLANNING A ROAD TRIP THIS MONTH & OF COURSE DID ALL THAT WAS NECESSARY INCLUDING A VEHICLE CHECKUP.  AFTER DRIVING ABOUT 2 HOURS ON THE HIGHWAY (W/ A BREAK AFTER AN HOUR, WHICH INCLUDED  ANOTHER VEHICLE CHECKUP), THE STEERING WHEEL STARTING SHAKING VIOLENTLY & I SAW SMOKE COMING FROM THE SIDE OF MY CAR THROUGH MY SIDE VIEW MIRROR.  PULLED OVER TO FIND THAT ONE OF MY TIRES WAS COMPLETELY BLOWN OUT & THE SIDE WALL WAS TORN.  I WAS IN COMPLETE SHOCK.  THESE WERE NEW TIRES- ONLY A YEAR OLD, WITH CONSIDERABLE TREAD ON THEM.  THERE WAS NO REASON FOR IT TO GET BLOWN OUT LIKE THIS.  CALLED AAA FOR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE & THEY HAD TO PUT A SPARE TIRE ON.  I WAS HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY FROM HOME & FROM MY DESTINATION & THERE WERE NO TIRE SHOPS OPEN IN THE AREA.  HAD TO DRIVE CLOSE TO 100 MILES, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH THE EMERGENCY LIGHTS ON AT 50 MPH TO GET TO A 24 HR TIRE SHOP.  FIRST SHOP DIDN'T HAVE MY TIRE SIZE, BUT SECOND ONE DID.  TIRE WAS INSPECTED & THERE WAS NO OTHER DAMAGE OR ADVERSE OBJECTS FOUND WITH THE TIRE OTHER THAN THE SIDEWALL BEING TORN & THE TIRE BLOWN OUT. HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PAY FOR A NEW TIRE (THEY HAD NO USED  TIRE), SINCE I WAS STILL HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY FROM HOME & MY DESTINATION, & I COULDN'T KEEP DRIVING WITH A SPARE TIRE ON.  I ENDED UP PAYING A HEFTY FEE FOR THE NEW TIRE & OTHER CHARGES.    I INITIALLY PAID A VERY HIGH AMOUNT, FOR WHAT I THOUGHT WERE QUALITY TIRES FROM HANKOOK, APPARENTLY I WAS VERY WRONG.

NEXT THING I HEAR IS A HUGE BOOM AND I LOOK BACK AND MY AIRBAGS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF MY CAR WERE COMPLETELY DEPLOYED.  MY CURTAIN AIRBAGS AND MY SEAT AIRBAG BOTH DEPLOYED.  I WENT TO THE SAM SWOPE DEALERSHIP AT 1 SWOPE AUTOCENTER DR, LOUISVILLE, KY 40299 WHERE I PURCHASED MY CAR AND EXPLAINED THE ISSUE TO THEM.  THEY TOLD ME THAT THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN 2008 ACCORDS AND THAT THEY WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND GET BACK TO ME.  THEY PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THEY SAW NO DEFAULT CODES SO IT WAS NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX IT AND QUOTED ME $5000 THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET TO FIX IT.  I WAS ANGRY AND TOLD THEM I WOULD NOT STAND FOR IT AND I WANTED TO SPEAK WITH CORPORATE.  I HAD TO THEN TAKE MY VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR CORPORATE TO  LOOK  IT OVER.  A WEEK OR SO LATER I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM THE CORPORATE OFFICE INFORMING ME THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THEY COULD DO AND IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX IT.  I WAS LIVID!!!  I PAY MY CAR PAYMENT ON TIME EVERY MONTH, PAY FOR AN EXTENDED WARRANTY AND GAP INSURANCE BUT OBVIOUSLY HONDA DOES NOT HOLD TRUE TO TREATING THEIR CUSTOMERS THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE TREATED.  I AM 24 YEARS OLD AND SINGLE AND DO NOT $5000 JUST LAYING AROUND TO FIX THE ISSUE, SO I HAVE BEEN DRIVING AROUND EVER SINCE WITH NO AIRBAGS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  I TRULY HOPE THE MORE PEOPLE THAT COME FORWARD WITH THIS ISSUE WILL GET 2008 HONDA ACCORDS RECALLED.  PAYING $400 A MONTH FOR 3 MORE YEARS OF THE 6 YEAR LOAN I HAVE IS VERY FRUSTRATING WHEN HONDA DOES NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS WHATSOEVER.   *TR",

I TOOK MY CAR TO THE HONDA DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THEM ABOUT THE OIL CONSUMPTION.  THEY TOPPED ME OFF, AND PUT ME ON AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST.  INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THERE WAS AN OIL CONSUMPTION RECALL ON MY CAR ABOUT A MONTH LATER.  THE DEALERSHIP UPDATED THE SOFTWARE TO PREVENT OIL CONSUMPTION AND I WAS SENT ON MY WAY.  ABOUT A MONTH LATER, MY CAR WAS STILL CONSUMING OIL AT ABOUT A QUART PER 2290MILES.  THAT WAS THE OFFICIAL HONDA TALLY AT THE END OF MY OIL CONSUMPTION TEST.  I CONTACTED HONDA THROUGH WRITTEN LETTER AND PHONE CALL SAYING THAT THEIR RECALL/SOFTWARE UPDATE DID NOT WORK AND THAT MY CAR WAS STILL CONSUMING OIL.  AMERICAN HONDA WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE ME WITH ANY DOCUMENTATION ABOUT WHAT ACCEPTABLE OIL CONSUMPTION ON A CAR WAS, BUT IN THEIR WORDS IT WAS 1QT/1000 MILES.  NO WHERE IN THE BILL OF SALE OR OWNERS MANUAL DOES IT SAY THE OWNER WILL HAVE TO ADD OIL DURING REGULAR DRIVING TO KEEP THE OIL AT ACCEPTABLE LEVELS.  TALKING WITH BOTH AMERICAN HONDA AND DEALERSHIPS AS WELL, THEY REFUSE TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND THEY ARE UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY PROOF THAT CONSUMING OIL AT THIS RATE WILL NOT HARM THE CAR.  I AM CURRENTLY ADDING ABOUT 1QT/1500MILES TO KEEP MY CAR FROM RUNNING OUT OF OIL, AND UNDER THE 5YEAR 60K WARRANTY, HONDA STILL HAS NOT FIXED THE PROBLEM.

NOW THE HEAD RESTRAINTS ARE VERTICAL, A MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE ANGLE FOR MY BODY. I NO LONGER EXPERIENCE DISCOMFORT AND CHRONIC PAIN FROM DRIVING MY VEHICLE. THE ACTIVE RESTRAINT SYSTEM STILL WORKS PERFECTLY.  AS I UNDERSTAND THE NEW REGULATIONS REGARDING HEAD RESTRAINTS, A MANUFACTURER MUST EITHER USE A FIXED ANGLE HEAD RESTRAINT OR AN ACTIVE SYSTEM THAT MOVES THE HEAD RESTRAINING FORWARD IN A REAR COLLISION. I AM NOT SURE WHY HONDA DID BOTH THINGS. WHEN I LOOK AT OTHER NEW VEHICLES, THE EXTREME FORWARD ANGLED HEAD RESTRAINTS ARE IN EVERY CAR I'VE SEEN AND I WILL NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER VEHICLE WITH THEM.

I SUGGEST REVISING THE REGULATION TO ONLY ACTIVE RESTRAINT SYSTEMS OR HAVING FULLY ADJUSTABLE HEAD RESTRAINTS AND INCLUDING INFORMATION ON PROPER ADJUSTMENT. I BELIEVE THERE IS NO NET BENEFIT OF THESE FORWARD SLOPING HEAD RESTRAINTS. ANY REDUCTION IN WHIPLASH CLAIMS WILL PROBABLY BE OFFSET BY A LARGER INCREASE IN THERAPY SERVICES AND ATTEMPTS TO ALTER THE HEAD RESTRAINTS. ON SEVERAL FORUMS, PEOPLE HAVE INDICATED THEY TURNED THE HEADRESTS BACKWARDS. IN MY CAR, THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED A DANGEROUS BACKWARD ANGLE OFFERING NO SUPPORT TO THE HEAD IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT. THE ACTIVE HEAD RESTRAINT SYSTEMS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE A GOOD NON-INTRUSIVE WAY TO INCREASE SAFETY.  *TR",

THEY HAD TO REPLACE THE DRIVER SIDE SEAT AND THE ENTIRE HEAD LINER PLUS ALL OF THE AIR BAGS TOTALING 3,600.00     I CALLED MY INSURANCE AND THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD COVER IT BUT THAT I HAD A $1,250.00 DEDUCTIBLE (TWO TEENAGE DRIVERS). I WAS TOLD THAT I SHOULD TAKE MY CAR TO THE GOODSON BODY SHOP BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE DOING THE WORK.  WHEN I TOOK MY CAR THERE THEY LOOKED IT OVER AGAIN AND I ASKED THE QUESTION WHY WOULD THE SIDE AIR BAG GO OFF WHEN I CLOSE THE DOOR.  THEY COULDN'T EXPLAIN IT EITHER AND THEY QUESTIONED WHETHER THE DAMAGE TO THE RIGHT UNDERCARRIAGE CAUSED THE AIR BAGS TO GO OFF.  THEY ASKED THE SERVICE FOLKS AND A HONDA REP TO COME OUT AND MEET AND AGAIN HONDA DENIED THE CLAIM AS WARRANTY.     I SPOKE WITH MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND SOMEONE SENT ME A INTERESTING ARTICLE THAT I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD SHARE WITH YOU:    HTTP://WWW.THEBOSTONCHANNEL.COM/R/20040559/DETAIL.HTML         A BOSTON CHANNEL DID A REPORT AND FOUND THAT THIS IS HAPPENING IN THE 2008 MODEL ACCORDS AND HONDA CONTINUES TO DENY THAT THERE MIGHT BE A PROBLEM.  I WONDER IF ANYONE IN HOUSTON HAS HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE THAT I'M HAVING AND IF HONDA IS TRYING TO COVER SOMETHING UP LIKE TOYOTA. *TR",

I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE FRONT BRAKE PADS BECAUSE OF PROBLEM WITH REAR, AND DEALER SAID THE FRONT PADS WERE FINE. THEN ABOUT 33,000 MILES I STARTED TO GET A SHIMMY IN THE FRONT WHEN I BRAKED AT HIGHWAY SPEED (OVER 55 MPH). IT WASN'T TOO BAD AT FIRST, BUT PROGRESSIVELY GOT WORSE. WHEN THE FRONT STARTED TO PULL TO THE LEFT WHEN I BRAKED COMING OFF THE INTERSTATE, I TOLD THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP AND HE SAID IT'S PROBABLY A WARPED ROTOR. PLUS, THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THERE HAD BEEN OTHER COMPLAINTS. HE SAID HE WOULD MACHINE THE FRONT ROTORS, BUT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. THE COST IS WAY BEYOND MY BUDGET.  I HAVE NEARLY 39,000 MILES ON THE BRAKES AND THE SHIMMY IS A MAJOR SHAKE WHEN I BRAKE AT HIGHWAY SPEED AND AT LOW SPEEDS IT FEELS LIKE I'M DRIVING ON ROCKS WHEN I BRAKE, ALTHOUGH I'LL BE ON A SMOOTH SERVICE.  THE PULL TO THE LEFT COMING OFF THE INTERSTATE IS SO WRONG FOR A 2008 CAR. I HAD IT ALIGNED TWICE JUST IN CASE THAT WAS THE PROBLEM, BUT I WAS ASSURED THE ALIGNMENT WAS GOOD, BUT THE ROTORS WERE NOT. THIS WAS FROM A HIGHLY EXPERIENCED MECHANIC NOT EMPLOYED BY HONDA. HE ALSO SAID HE HAD TALKED TO A NUMBER OF  OWNERS OF HONDA ACCORDS OF THE 2008 OR LATER MODEL YEAR AND THEY HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH BRAKE ROTORS WARPING. THAT'S THE EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE PROBLEM.  THE BRAKE ROTOR FAILURE OCCURS EVERY MILE I DRIVE AND  THE CONSEQUENCES ARE IT TAKES MUCH MORE STOPPING DISTANCE WHEN I APPLY THE BRAKES, AND IF IT'S WET, EVEN MORE STOPPING DISTANCE TO SAFELY OPERATE THE VEHICLE. NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO CORRECT THE FAILURE. HONDA SAYS IT MUST BE THE WAY I BRAKE, ALTHOUGH MOST OF MY DRIVING IS ON THE INTERSTATE. I FOUND OUT FROM OTHER HONDA ACCORD OWNERS THAT HAVE HAD THE ROTORS TURNED THAT THEY HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN IN 15,000 MILES. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE, AND HONDA NEEDS TO RECALL ACCORDS AND FIX THEM. *TR",

WHEN THE VEHICLE STABILITY ASSIST AND BRAKE ASSIST FUNCTION WAS ENGAGED, I BELIEVE THE WORN STATE OF THE REAR BRAKES AS OPPOSED TO THE ALMOST NEW CONDITION OF THE FRONT BRAKES CAUSED THE BACK END OF MY CAR TO SWING AROUND AND SPIN OUT OF CONTROL.  THIS IS A DOCUMENTED PROBLEM WITH THE 2008 ACCORDS (ON THE INTERNET), BUT AMERCIAN HONDA HAS YET TO EVEN ADMIT THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM.  I AM LUCKY THAT I WAS NOT SEVERELY INJURED OR KILLED IN THAT HIGH SPEED CRASH.  FORTUNATELY, THE HONDA ENGINEERS THAT DESIGNED THE AIRBAGS PUT MORE THOUGHT INTO THEIR DESIGN THAN THE ENGINEERS THAT DESIGNED A REAR BRAKING SYSTEM THAT WEARS DOWN AFTER 20,000 MILES.  I CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT 57,000 MILES ON MY ACCORD AND HAVE NOW REPLACED THE REAR BRAKE PADS AND ROTORS TWICE. *TR",

IT APPEARED THAT I WAS HAVING SERIOUS BRAKE PROBLEMS.      AFTER AN INQUIRY OF THE BRAKE'S QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE, THE SERVICE ADVISOR, CARL REED CONFIRMED THAT THE REAR BRAKE SHOES WOULD BE REPLACED WITH A BETTER QUALITY.  HE INFORMED ME THAT HONDA'S CORPORATE OFFICE HAD SELECTED A NEW COMPANY THAT WOULD PROVIDE BETTER QUALITY, AND LONGER LIFE SPANS OF THEIR BRAKE SHOES AND PADS.  IN ADDITION, HONDA'S TECHNICIAN HAD TO REPLACE THE FRONT BRAKE PADS AT APPROXIMATELY 20,000 MILES.  THE QUALITIES OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM USING LOW QUALITY BRAKE PADS AND SHOES HAVE PROVEN TO BE A NUISANCE FOR OWNERS.    THE SERVICE ADVISOR, CARL REED, DROVE THE VEHICLE TO THE REAR OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND IT STAYED HIDDEN FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES.  THEN ONE OF HONDA'S ROUGE TECHNICIANS, JOSE TERDOMO, DROVE THE VEHICLE INSIDE THE SERVICE AREA WHERE IT WAS VISIBLE FROM A WINDOW.  HE KEPT THE HOOD OF THE VEHICLE OPEN AS HE REMOVED THE REAR BRAKE SHOES.  AROUND 6:10 REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED, AND I CHECKED THE VEHICLE OUT AT 6:19.

WHILE VENTURING BACK AND FORTH TO WORK FRIDAY, 03/12/2010, THE AIR QUALITY THAT FLOWED FROM THE VENT WAS UNFIT FOR HUMANS TO BREATHE.  AS IT FLOWED FROM THE AIR CONDITION VENTS, IT PERMEATED THE AIR WITH DANGEROUS NANOPARTICLES, LETHAL CHEMICALS, AND IRRITANT GASES COMPRESSED WITH TETRAFLUOROETHANE (R-134A).

FIRST INCIDENT WAS IN THE FIRST WEEK OF OWNERSHIP. DEALER HAD TO REPLACE REAR ROTORS (WARPED).  2000 MILES.  DEALER (CARY AUTOPARK HONDA) FAILED TO PUT BOLTS IN CALIPERS WHICH FELL OFF CAUSING MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD.   I HAD TO NURSE THE VEHICLE TO ANOTHER DEALER  FOR REPAIRS.  THE SERVICE MANAGER FROM CARY AUTO PARK, NEVER RETURNED MY CALLS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.    VEHICLE HAS BEEN IN TWO MORE TIMES FOR WARPED ROTORS, FRONT AND REAR. I HAVE GONE TO FIVE DIFFERENT DEALERS HOPING FOR SOME REASONABLE FINAL SOLUTION TO THIS VERY REAL PROBLEM OVER THE YEAR I HAVE OWNED THIS CAR (CARY AUTO PARK CROWN HONDA SOUTHPOINT, ASHEBORO HONDA).      ON 7/31 I WAS INFORMED THAT ALL ROTORS NEEDED TO BE RESURFACED AND THE REAR PADS NEEDED REPLACEMENT.   DEALER WAS LEITH CAPITOL BLVD IN RALEIGH NC.  HONDA WAS NOT GOING TO COVER $500 COST BUT THE DEALER WOULD COVER RE-SURFACING AS GOODWILL. THE REARS WOULD HAVE TO BE PAID BY ME. IT WAS LIKELY I WOULD NEED TO REPLACE THE REAR PADS EVERY 12K MILES.   I HAVE NEVER NEEDED TO REPLACE BRAKES SOONER THAN 100K! I CALLED AND LEFT HONDA IN CA A VOICE MESSAGE. AS OF TODAY, HONDA HAS NOT RETURNED MY CALLS.     I HAVE TRADED THE CAR IN AT A SIGNIFICANT LOSS IN EQUITY. MY CONFIDENCE IN THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE AND THE INTEGRITY OF HONDA SERVICE MAKES ME UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE CAR ON A DAILY BASIS.     WITH ALL THE POSTS ON THE NHTSA FOR BRAKE PROBLEMS I BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE A FORCED RECALL. IT'S OUTRAGEOUS.

WHEN I STOPPED TO INSPECT THE TIRE AND REPLACE IT WITH THE TEMPORARY SPARE, I FOLLOWED THE PROCEDURES FOR USING THE STANDARD-ISSUE JACK THAT CAME WITH THE VEHICLE TO GET THE DAMAGED TIRE OFF THE CAR.     THE JACK, HOWEVER, BENT UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE; THEN IT SLIPPED OUT FROM UNDER THE FRAME, CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE METAL BELOW THE DOOR. THE JACK, WHICH DOES NOT FEATURE A SLOT (MORE OF AN INDENTED PLATE) TO FIT NEATLY AROUND THE REINFORCED PART OF THE FRAME, DID NOT HOLD UP THE CAR.    BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE POORLY DESIGNED JACK CONTRIBUTED TO THE DAMAGE, I CONTACTED AMERICAN HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND STARTED A CASE. FOLLOWING THE DIRECTION OF MY CASE MANAGER, DAVID KITCHEN, I VISITED THE BREAKAWAY HONDA, WHERE THE PARTS TECHNICIAN COMMENTED THAT I DID INDEED HAVE A \"DEFECTIVE JACK.\" HE TOOK PICTURES, GAVE ME AN ESTIMATE, THEN COMMUNICATED THIS TO DAVID KITCHEN. THIS WAS ON OCT. 21, 2009.    SINCE THEN, I HAVE FALLEN INTO A \"BLACK HOLE\" WITH AMERICAN HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE. I HAVE LEFT MANY MESSAGES FOR DAVID KITCHEN, WITH VERY LITTLE RESPONSE OR FEEDBACK. I EVEN SENT A LETTER TO HIROYUKI YAMADA, COO OF CUSTOMER SERVICE, WHICH HE NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED.    FINALLY, ON JANUARY 19, 2010, I WAS INFORMED BY MR. KITCHEN THAT MY REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE WAS REJECTED BY AMERICAN HONDA BECAUSE THE HONDA ENGINEERS \"COULD NOT VERIFY THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH I USED THE JACK.\"    I SHARED THAT THIS ANSWER WAS UNSATISFACTORY -- THAT I WAS TOLD BY THE PARTS TECHNICIAN THAT I HAD A DEFECTIVE JACK -- AND REQUESTED ANOTHER PERSON WITHIN AMERICAN HONDA TO WHOM I COULD APPEAL.

I PAID $205 TO HAVE THE REAR BRAKES REPLACED.  IN MAY 09  (9 MONTHS LATER), I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO HONDA FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND WAS INFORMED THAT THE REAR BRAKES NEEDED REPLACED.  AT THIS TIME, THE VEHICLE HAD 39K TOTAL MILES, WHICH WAS ONLY 20K MILES SINCE THE LAST TIME I HAD BRAKES PUT ON THE VEHICLE THE FIRST TIME.  I ONCE AGAIN PAID $215 TO HONDA FOR THE REPAIR.  I QUESTIONED HONDA ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND WAS INFORMED THAT IT RELATED TO DRIVER HABITS AND THE FACT THAT I LIVED IN A CONGESTED AREA.  I INFORMED THEM THAT THIS WAS THE ONLY VEHICLE THAT I HAVE REPLACED REAR BRAKES ON EVERY 20K MILES.  I ADVISED THAT THE 2006 HONDA ACCORD THAT I TRADED IN WITH 94K MILES HAD BRAKES REPLACED ONCE, WHICH WAS AT THE 80K MARK.  I ALSO ADVISED THEM THAT THIS WAS A COMMUTER CAR AND THAT I HAVE HAD THE SAME COMMUTE FOR 4 YEARS, SO THE PROBLEM WAS NOT RELATED TO ME OR THE CONGESTION.  IMMEDIATELY AFTER DRIVING THE CAR AWAY FROM THE DEALERSHIP AFTER MY SECOND BRAKE REPAIR, I NOTICED THAT THE STEERING WHEEL VIBRATED WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES AND THE CAR DID NOT STOP AS QUICKLY AS IT SHOULD.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK IN TO HAVE IT INSPECTED BY HONDA AND WAS TOLD THAT THE BRAKES LOOKED FINE.  HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM HAS CONTINUED.  I AM NOW AT 59,000 MILES AND NOTICING THAT THE CAR IS MAKING SQUEALING NOISES WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES.  THEREFORE, THIS WILL BE THE 3RD TIME I AM REPLACING BRAKES ON A NEW CAR.  HONDA WILL NOT OWN UP TO THIS SAFETY HAZARD.  I INVESTIGATED TRADING IT IN, BUT WAS TOLD BY HONDA THAT THE 09 & 10 MODELS HAVE THEM SAME PART NUMBER.  THIS PROBLEM WILL ONLY CONTINUE TO GROW.

TYPICALLY, I WOULD NOT HAVE THE BRAKES CHECKED AT 17,000 MILES FOR NO REASON. THE PROBLEM WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION ON A ROUTINE OIL CHANGE.  TO ME, THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD.  HAD I NOT HAT THAT OIL CHANGE, I WOULD HAVE KEPT ON DRIVING AN UNSAFE CAR, WITH THE RISK OF A COMPLETE BRAKE FAILURE. THE DEALERSHIP WOULD NOT COVER THE COST ($270) BECAUSE HONDA IS NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH 2008 AND 2009 ACCORDS.

I COMPLAINED TO THE SERVICE REP WHO SAID THEY VISUALLY INSPECTED THE BRAKES AND EVERYTHING LOOKED FINE. THEY SUGGESTED IT WOULD GO AWAY. AT 12K MILES AND MY SECOND OIL CHANGE, I HAD THE SAME COMPLAINT. AGAIN THEY INSPECTED THE BRAKES AND SAID THEY LOOKED FINE, AND THAT IT COULD BE A PIECE OF ROCK STUCK IN THERE SOMEWHERE, AND IT WOULD COST IF THEY WERE TO DO A THOROUGH INSPECTION. THIS TREND CONTINUED TO MY FOURTH OIL CHANGE WHERE THE TECH SUGGESTED THAT MY BRAKES WOULD BE DUE FOR REPLACEMENT DURING MY NEXT OIL CHANGE. I COULDN'T WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT OIL CHANGE BECAUSE MY BRAKES WERE SQUEALING TO THE POINT OF EMBARRASSMENT. WITHIN THE SAME MONTH, I HAD THE REAR BRAKES REPLACED. THE TECH AGREED THAT IT WAS TIME AND IT WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT TO THE NEXT OIL CHANGE. I PAID JUST UNDER $200 FOR THIS SERVICE. IT HASN'T BEEN A MONTH AND MY FRONT BRAKES ARE ALSO SQUEAKING TO THE POINT OF EMBARRASSMENT.     I THINK THIS IS ABSURD FOR A NEW CAR. I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER, A SALES MANAGER, AND ONE OTHER PERSON WHO IS ABOVE BOTH OF THEM. THEY ARE ALL TELLING ME THE SAME THING.

AFTER ONE DAY OF DRIVING WITH THE NOISE I FELT A NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE IN MY VEHICLE'S BREAKING AND HIGHWAY DRIVING. I INFORMED THE DEALER OF THIS AND WAS TOLD THAT ANY ABNORMAL BRAKE WEAR WILL EFFECT MY VEHICLES STABILITY ASSIST SYSTEM (SAS) WHICH CONTROLS THE VEHICLE'S TRACTION, SPEED, ACCELERATION, ETC..    WHEN I TOOK MY CAR INTO A REPAIR SHOP (NOT THE DEALER DUE TO THEIR ABSORBENT PRICES) THEY NOTIFIED ME THAT MY REAR INTERIOR BRAKEPAD WAS WORN DOWN TO THE INDICATORS. UNFORTUNATELY I HAD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET TO GET THIS FIXED BECAUSE HONDA INFORMED ME THIS WAS NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT IS A KNOWN DEFECT THEY ARE NOT COVERING THE COST BECAUSE A RECALL IS NOT IN PLACE YET.     I HAVE CHECKED SEVERAL CONSUMER WEBSITES WHEREIN THIS HAS BEEN NOTED AS A CONTINUOUS PROBLEM WITH THIS MAKE AND MODEL VEHICLE. EVERY 12,000-15,000 MILES OR SO THE REAR BRAKE PADS WEAR OUT PREMATURELY. I AM CONCERNED DUE TO THE RAPID PACE THAT THE BRAKE PADS WEAR OUT AT AND AM FEARFUL THAT MY VEHICLE (AND OTHERS LIKE IT) WILL LOOSE STABILITY AND RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT IF THIS PROBLEM IS NOT RESOLVED.

CARCOMPLAINTS.COM HAS 350 COMPLAINTS AND COUNTING AS OF 7/9/09 SO I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT HONDA AMERICA HAS NEVER BEEN NOTIFIED OF THIS PROBLEM. I SAVED MY OLD PARTS AND THE RECEIPT/INVOICE FROM THE REPAIR PLACE I WENT TO AND AM EXPECTING A RECALL TO BE ISSUED (EVENTUALLY) SO THAT I AS WELL AS HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF OTHERS CAN BE REIMBURSED FOR THIS UNNECESSARY EXPENSE.

BEGINNING IN DECEMBER OF 2008, I DETECTED AN INTERMITTENT NOISE WHICH CAN BEST BE DESCRIBED AS THE SOUND OF AIR MOVING THROUGH A STRAW WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES, WHICH WAS SUSTAINED THROUGH SUBSEQUENT ACCELERATION UNTIL REPEATED APPLICATION AND RELEASE OF THE BRAKES CAUSED THE NOISE TO CEASE.  IT WAS AUDIBLE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE CAR, AND COULD NOT BE ISOLATED TO ONE PARTICULAR AREA OF THE CAR (REAR OR FRONT), THOUGH IT APPEARED TO ORIGINATE IN THE WHEELS AREA.  THIS WAS REPORTED TO THE DEALER DURING VISITS FOR OIL CHANGES AND TIRE ROTATIONS, AS WELL AS A SEPARATE VISIT SPECIFICALLY TO ASSESS THIS ONGOING OCCURRENCE.  I WAS REPEATEDLY ASSURED THAT THEY HAD NOT HEARD THE NOISE, BUT HAD CHECKED THE BRAKES AND TIRES AND ALL WAS FINE, THERE WERE NO SUSPECTED OR VISIBLE CONCERNS.  ONE DAY PRIOR TO MY MOST RECENT SERVICE APPOINTMENT OF JUNE 11, 2009, THE NOISE CHANGED (THOUGH WAS STILL VERY INTERMITTENT) AND BEGAN TO SOUND AND FEEL LIKE A GRINDING, METAL-TO-METAL NOISE, AS WELL AS A VIBRATION FELT IN THE BRAKE PEDAL.  WHEN INSPECTED DURING THE SERVICE APPOINTMENT, I WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAD DISCOVERED THAT THE REAR BRAKE PADS WERE COMPLETELY WORN AND DAMAGE HAD BEEN DONE TO THE ROTORS AS A RESULT.    THE REAR BRAKE PADS ON THE NEWER HONDA ACCORDS (AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS) WEAR EXTREMELY QUICKLY, AT APPROXIMATELY 18-20,000 MILES.

THEY TOLD ME TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE CAR UNTIL IT GOT LOUDER. I CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE CAR AND IT CONTINUED TO SQUEAL WITH EVERY BRAKING ATTEMPT. AT 16589 (2/20/09) I TOOK THE CAR IN AGAIN TO SEE IF THEY HAD A FIX. AT THAT TIME I WAS TOLD THAT THE REAR BRAKES WERE WORN DOWN TO THE METAL (ONLY THE INNER PADS ON BOTH SIDES), THE ROTORS WERE GOUGED AND THE DUST BOOTS HAD MELTED OFF ALLOWING DIRT TO GET INTO THE PISTONS AND LEAK BRAKE FLUID. THIS WAS NOT DETECTED DURING MY NORMAL TIRE ROTATIONS. THEY REPLACED THE PADS, ROTORS AND CALIPERS AND TOLD ME THAT THE PROBLEM WOULD BE BACK (DIAGNOSED BY THE DEALERSHIP AS PREMATURE REAR BRAKE FAILURE).

HONDA KNEW OF THIS PROBLEM IN 2007 CIVIC MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS AND IGNORED THE PROBLEM AND CONTINUED TO PUT THE DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSIONS IN THE 2008 ACCORDS AND CIVICS.  FINALLY AFTER A CONSUMER DEMONSTRATION IN CALIFORNIA AND COVERAGE BY THE LOCAL MEDIA, HONDA ISSUED A HONDA SERVICE BULLETIN 08-020 THAT REPLACES THE DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION PARTS.  I BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE A MANUFACTURER RECALL BASED ON THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS LISTED HERE WHERE THE CONSUMER WRITES THAT THEY BELIEVE IT IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN AND THAT THEY WERE ALMOST INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.

THIS ISSUE WAS PREVALENT SINCE I TOOK DELIVERY OF THE NEW CAR IN JULY, 2008.    2.)  SINCE TAKING DELIVERY OF THIS VEHICLE AND TO THE PRESENT DATE, THERE IS A WOBBLE/WHEEL SHIMMY IN THE SUSPENSION AT VARIOUS SPEEDS AND DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SEVERITY ON A DAILY BASIS.

IN ANY SEATING POSITION, THE MAJORITY OF THE PRESSURE IS CONCENTRATED ON MY LOWER BACK.  THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH THE SEAT IS THE AGGRESSIVE FORWARD ANGLE OF THE HEADREST.  THE HEADREST ANGLE IS NOT ADJUSTABLE, AND IT FORCES MY HEAD TO BE POSITIONED FURTHER FORWARD THAN IS COMFORTABLE, PLACING STRAIN ON MY NECK.  THIS IS AN 8-WAY POWER SEAT, AND I HAVE HAD IT IN EVERY POSSIBLE POSITION, BUT THE COMBINATION OF THE LUMBAR PLATE AND HEADREST ANGLE PRODUCES DISCOMFORT AND PAIN IN MY BACK, NECK, AND SHOULDERS.  I AM FEARFUL THAT THE SEAT MAY CAUSE PERMANENT INJURY TO MY BACK AND NECK AS I AM EXPERIENCING THE BACK AND NECK PAIN NOW EVEN WHEN I AM NOT SITTING IN THE CAR.

FOR SUCH A HIGHLY TOUTED VEHICLE MANUFACTURER, HONDA NEEDS TO WORK ON FIXING PROBLEMS WITH THEIR CARS ON THE ROAD AND FINDING A RESOLUTION, NOT JUST THEIR REPUTATION AND/OR THEIR BOTTOM LINE.  ALSO, HONDA NEEDS TO INSTRUCT ITS DEALERS TO TAKE ITS CUSTOMER'S COMPLAINT'S SERIOUSLY, NOT SIMPLY ATTEMPT TO DIMINISH THE COMPLAINT (I.E. HEADLIGHTS FLASHING) BECAUSE IT IS A WIDESPREAD ISSUE.  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH HONDA'S HANDLING OF THE DEFECTS. *TR",

POOR HEADLIGHT PERFORMANCE IS 'NORMAL' DUE TO THE OPERATION OF THE ELECTRICAL LOAD DETECTOR (ELD).  THE FUNCTION OF THE ELD IS TO PROVIDE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM DEMAND INFORMATION TO THE ONBOARD COMPUTER MODULE.  THE ONBOARD COMPUTER THEN USES THE PROVIDED INFORMATION TO ADJUST ALTERNATOR OUTPUT WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTS IN FUEL SAVINGS.   HONDA IS ASSUMING THAT CUSTOMERS ARE WILLING TO SACRIFICE NORMAL HEADLIGHT PERFORMANCE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF INCREASING FUEL MILEAGE.     THE OPERATIONAL DESIGN OF ONE SYSTEM PRODUCES A SIDE AFFECT IN ANOTHER SYSTEM THAT RESULTS IN A SAFETY RISK.    RISKS OF OPERATING A VEHICLE WITH POOR HEADLIGHT PERFORMANCE ARE PROVIDED BELOW.   1. REDUCED VISIBILITY AND DRIVING CONCENTRATION COULD RESULT IN A COLLISION.  2.
