THE FIGURE FOR A NEW ENGINE IS $9000,  WE DECIDED TO TAKE THE CAR TO A AUTO SHOP NEAR THE HOUSE WHERE THE OIL SLUDGE WAS CLEANED.  WE GOT THE CAR BACK. WITHIN A FEW WEEKS, THE CAR BROKE DOWN ON A BUSY HIGHWAY INTERSECTION LATE AT NIGHT.  WE HAD THE CAR TOWED HOME AS IT WAS VERY LATE.  WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO CHARLES MAUND TOYOTA WHO SOLD US THE CAR (CAR PREVIOUSLY OWNED BY THE OWNER CHARLES MAUND.  WE BOUGHT IT WITH 7000 MILES ON IT IN 2000T.  THE MECHANICS THERE CLEANED THE SLUDGE AND TRY TO TEST DRIVE, ONLY TO HAVE THE ENGINE SHUT DOWN AGAIN..THEY TOOK IT APART AND FOUND THAT THE ENGINE HAS BEEN DAMAGED BEYOND REPAIR DUE TO THE SLUDGE PROBLEM.  WE DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE WEB AND  HAS THEM TO MAKE GOOD ON THE REPAIRS EVEN THOUGH WE WERE NOT NOTIFIED OF THE CSP AND WERE NOT ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT DURING THE TIME LIMIT PLACED ON THE CSP BY TOYOTA CORP.   THE PROBLEM IS WELL KNOWN AND WELL DOCUMENTED.  WE HAVE REGULARLY CHANGED THE OIL, THOUGH NOT ALWAYS WITH TOYOTA DEALER AS WE HAVE MOVED.  THE ENGINE BREAKDOWN COULD HAVE CAUSED ACCIDENTS HAD WE NOT BEEN ABLE TO COAST TO A NARROW SHOULDER BY THE CORNER OF 2222/360 HIGHWAY INTERCHANGE.   WE WANT TOYOTA TO REPLACE THE ENGINE AND CORRECT THE DEFECTIVE DESIGN. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT MR. CHARLES MAUND MAY HAVE RECEIVED THE CSP NOTICE AS HE WAS THE \"ORIGINAL OWNER\" BUT FAIL TO COMMUNICATE THAT TO US.

I HAD THE CAR TOWED BACK TO THE DEALER FOR INSPECTION.  A TOYOTA FACTOR REPRESENTATIVE EXAMINED THE CAR ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2000.  I RECIEVED A CALL FROM TOYOTA TODAY AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY CAR.  THIS IS THE BIGGEST BUNCH OF BULL SINCE FIRESTONE SAID THEY MAKE GOOD TIRES.  I TALKED TO THE OWNER OF THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND TOLD HIM THAT I HAD LOST COFINDENCE IN THE CAR AND TOYOTA, AND WANTED MY MONEY BACK.  HE SAID THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS AN \"ALLEGED\" BREAK FAILURE THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO ABOUT IT.  MY ONLY RECOURSE WAS TO THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AND THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES (ADMINISTERS THE TEXAS LEMON LAW).  I WILL PERSUE THESE AVENUES OF RECOURSE, BUT ALSO WANT TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE NHTSA.  I BELIEVE THAT TOYOTA'S LAWYERS HAVE CONTROL OF THIS SITUATION, AND THERE IS NO WAY THEY WILL ADMIT THAT THEIR PRODUCE IS FAULTY.

        "summary": "HELLO, I HAVE A 2000 TOYOTA TOCOMA 4X4 THAT I PURCHASED THIS PAST APRIL.  FOR THE PAST MONTH I HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH THE FIRESTONE WILDERNESS AT TIRES THAT WERE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT ON THE TRUCK.  I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE TOYOTA DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE TRUCK TO HAVE THE TIRES LOOKED AT.  THE TIRES WERE MAKING A THUMPING NOISE.  THIS WAS BEFORE I HAD HEARD ABOUT THE PROBLEM FIRESTONE WAS HAVING.  THE DEALER TOLD ME TO TAKE THEM TO FIRESTONE TO HAVE THEM LOOKED AT, WHICH I DID.  THE FIRESTONE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE TIRES WERE LOW ON AIR (THE 26 PSI THAT THE TOYOTA DEALER TOLD ME TO RUN THE TIRES ON), AND THAT THE FRONT TIRES HAD EXCESSIVE WEAR.  FIRESTONE SAID THE TIRES SHOULD HAVE 32 PSI.  FIRESTONE REPLACED THE TIRES COSTING ME $56.00 OF MY OWN MONEY.  THE VERY NEXT DAY I COULD NOT EXCEED 55 MPH WITHOUT THE STEERING WHEEL AND FRONT END SHAKING UNCONTROLLABLY.  I NOTIFIED FIRESTONE AND THEY FOUND THE TWO NEW TIRES WERE BAD ALSO.  THEY REPLACED THOSE WITH YET ANOTHER TWO NEW TIRES.  I SEE NOW FIRESTONE IS RECALLING WILDERNESS AT TIRES HOWEVER, THEY ARE ONLY RECALLING SIZE P235/75R15.  THE ORIGINAL TIRES ON MY TRUCK WERE WILDERNESS AT 265/75R15, SO I GUESS I\u0012M NOT INCLUDED.  WITH ALL THE TROUBLE I HAVE HAD WITH THESE TIRES, I FEAR DRIVING ANY LONG DISTANCES WITH THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NOT THE SIZE BEING RECALLED.  ADDITIONALLY, MY WIFE REFUSES TO RIDE IN THE TRUCK UNTIL WE REPLACE THE FIRESTONE TIRES.  I CANNOT AFFORD AT THIS POINT TO PURCHASE ALL NEW TIRES.  I HAVE ASKED TOYOTA TO REPLACE THE TIRES ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT FIRESTONE IS RESPONSIBLE.  I WOULD STILL LIKE TO REPLACE THESE TIRES WITH SOMETHING LIKE GOODYEAR ATS TIRES OF THE SAME SIZE AND STYLE. IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT THE TIRES I HAVE WILL BE INVOLVED IN THIS SOON?  PLEASE RESPOND AS SOON AS YOU CAN, THANK YOU.( DOT NUMBER: BM13571-4 TIRE SIZE: P265/75R15 )",
