I have now had 3 coil packs blow out at random causing the holes that the bolt straps the coil pack to the spark plug to strip out. I have a transmission leak that will not stop and I've taken it in multiple times for repairs and it still is leaking. Since getting this vehicle i noticed at the electrical issue where everything including my headlights will shut off and then pop back on while I'm driving. My seat belt will not open so i can buckle and I'm now getting frustrated because I've spent a lot of money on this only to realize has had the same issue with previous owners and they for some reason were too embarrassed to report it but I'm not and I'm sick of dumping money into this damb thing!",

WE REPLACED THE TPS AT A COST OF AROUND $300 AS A POSSIBLE FIX AND THIS WORKED FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS - NOW THE PROBLEM IS BACK AND MY RESEARCH INDICATES WE NEED TO HAVE THE THROTTLE BODY REPLACED. THIS WILL COST US AROUND $500 - FOR A TOTAL REPAIR COST OF AROUND $800 - WHICH WE CANNOT AFFORD! FORD HAS LITERALLY $HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS TO TAKE CARE OF THIS AND MUST RECALL DUE TO THIS ISSUE - THERE IS NO EXCUSE TO ALLOW THIS DANGEROUS PROBLEM TO CONTINUE. FORD MOTOR CO. OWES ME $800 DUE TO THEIR POOR ENGINEERING AND UNWILLINGNESS TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE - THEY ARE GREEDY CROOKS.  *TR",

I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A DEALERSHIP, GUS MACHADO FORD IN MIAMI, FL AND MENTIONED THIS ISSUE. I WAS TOLD THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE CAR GOING INTO ENGINE FAILSAFE MODE AND LOOSING POWER WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS STILL RUNNING. THE VEHICLE WAS UNDER FACTORY WARRANTY AT THAT POINT AND THEY REFUSED TO FIX IT.  AT THAT TIME, I WAS NOT REALLY AWARE OF THE PROBLEM. AFTER IT HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN, I DID SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AND FOUND OUT THAT THOUSANDS OF OWNERS ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. AT THE TIME THE VEHICLE WAS OUT OF FACTORY WARRANTY. I CONTACTED FORD A COUPLE OF YEAR AGO AND AGAIN THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, EVEN IF THEY ARE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF OWNERS THAT HAVE REPORTED THIS PROBLEM TO FORD AS DESCRIBED IN DIFFERENT BLOGS ONLINE.   WHEN THIS HAPPENS, I HAVE TO FIND A PLACE TO STOP SINCE THE VEHICLE DOES NOT RESPOND TO THE GAS PEDAL EVEN IF IT IS STILL RUNNING. THE VEHICLE MUST BE TURNED OFF AND STARTED AGAIN. THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN FOR ME A MY FAMILY, EVEN MORE NOW WITH A NEWBORN. IF IT HAPPENS WHILE ON THE EXPRESSWAY OR HIGHWAY, WE CAN BE REAR ENDED BY ANOTHER DRIVE OR TRUCK SINCE THE VEHICLE LOOSES POWER AND THE VEHICLE MUST BE TURNED OFF. HERE IN MIAMI, THERE IS A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION GOING ON AND HIGHWAYS ARE BEING EXPANDED. MUST OF THE CONSTRUCTION HAS ELIMINATED THE EMERGENCY LANE, WHICH MEANS THAT IF THAT HAPPENS, WE ARE GOING TO BE STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY.   I CONTACTED FORD AGAIN A FEW WEEKS AGO AND MENTIONED THE PROBLEM AGAIN, THEY STILL \"\"DON'T KNOW\"\" ABOUT THIS EVEN IF IT IS BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE NHTSA. PLEASE HELP. MY VEHICLE IS A FORD EXPEDITION 2006.  *TR",

I AM ALSO AWARE OF A RECALL THAT WAS ON CERTAIN EXPEDITIONS AND NAVIGATORS FOR A NEW FUEL RAIL THAT WAS RUSTING INTERNALLY CAUSING THE SAME PROBLEMS BUT THE RECALL JUST CLAIMS THAT THE FUEL RAILS WERE \"DEFECTIVE\".FORD MOTOR COMPANY IS AWARE OF THESE CONCERNS AND REFUSES TO RESOLVE OR HELP ANY OWNERS OF THE AFFECTED VEHICLES OUTSIDE THE RECALL. IF THESE VEHICLES ARE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE WITHOUT BEING PROPERLY REPAIRED EVENTUALLY SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE INJURED OR WORSE. I HAVE WITNESSED ENGINE EXPLOSIONS AND FIRES CAUSED BY LEAKING INJECTORS. THIS IS CLEARLY A MANUFACTURE DEFECT AND SHOULD BE ADRESSED BY FORD MOTOR COMPANY.I URGE ANY FORD OWNERS WITH THIS PROBLEM TO FILE A CLAIM WITH NHTSA AS WELL AS FORD MOTOR COMPANY SO THEY CAN RESOLVE THESE CONCERN BEFORE ANYONE IS HARMED.ALL MY CUSTOMER WANTS IS THE FUEL RAIL AND INJECTORS REPLACED.  *TR",

ON 4/20/11 WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM WORK ON HIGHWAY AT 60 MPH THE \"ENGINE FAIL SAFE MODE\" ALARM & MESSAGE FLASHING ON PANEL. I WAS IN FAR RIGHT LANE SO AGAIN WAS ABLE TO COAST TO SHOULDER BEFORE STEERING LOCKED FROM NO POWER.  IF I HAD BEEN IN LEFT LANE I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET OFF ROADWAY. (ON 4/19/11 I HAD VEHICLE INSPECTED, IN NYS, NO CODES WERE ON THIS VEHICLE).  TOWED TO SHOP, AFTER RUNNING TESTS AND CALLS TO FORD THEY HAVE AGAIN REPLACED THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE BODY ASSEMBLY AS IT HAD FAILED. STILL NO RECALL.  THIS IS EXTREME SAFETY ISSUE.  I HAVE AVOIDED ACCIDENTS 3 TIMES, IF I HAD BEEN IN LEFT LANES I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SO LUCKY. THIS HAPPENS WITH NO ADVANCE WARNING. FORD KNOWS THERE IS A PROBLEM.",

A PERSON RECOMMENDED THAT I REPLACE THE THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR ,SO I DID AT BOB BOYD FORD FOR $196.58.
