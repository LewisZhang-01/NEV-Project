        "summary": "When driving down the road, the vehicle will chime several times and prompt two alternating messages across the dash saying \"Service: Power Steering. Drive With Care\" and \"Service: Stabilitrak\" as it cuts both the power steering and traction control to the vehicle. I have had this issue MANY times. If you turn off the ignition and restart the vehicle, it *usually* clears it up for a little while.  It is very random when it happens. Usually, it occurs while just driving down the road normally, but it occasionally happens as soon as you turn on the ignition. I will say that it seems to occur more frequently when the weather is warmer. It happened a good bit last summer, then I had very few incidents with it happening over the winter, but as soon as the temperature got over 80F this year, it started again about once every other time I drive it. It is possible that this is just coincidence, but I believe it to be the case. It has happened since about May, 2021, through now, March, 2022.  GM initially issued a recall for this issue on 3000 trucks of the 2015 year model. After many reports of it happening to other vehicles, they extended the recall to a good many other trucks, but still only to the 2015 year model. I have seen three or four reports online of it happening to others' 2016 models as well in addition to my own. This is a major safety hazard to both myself and others and has almost caused me to wreck twice as power steering cut off mid-turn. When I brought this up to my local GM dealer, they weren't able to make it happen while they had it but TOLD ME IT WAS A KNOWN ISSUE and just gave me an estimate of ~$2k to have it fixed. If it is a known issue, should there not be a recall?",

        "summary": "While driving down the highway at 75MPH, I heard an audible alert and a message appeared on my driver information screen in the dash that said \"Service Power Steering Soon! Please drive with care.\"  Immediately I noticed that the steering was EXTREMELY heavy (hard to turn).  A few seconds later another message appeared that said \"Service Stabilitrak System Soon.  Traction Control set to off.\"  I took the next offramp to get off the 6 lane highway.  There was a light at the bottom that was red.  When it turned green I had to make a left turn onto the cross road.  I was barely able to make the turn and nearly crossed lanes.  Turning into a gas station to check the engine was nearly impossible.  It took many forward/back maneuvers to simply get into a parking spot.  I shut off the truck and popped the hood.  Looked under engine area for leaks etc.  No issues visible - everything looked completely normal.  Upon restart, the issue cleared and power steering was restored.  Upon internet searching for the symptom I came across a recall I believe describes my issue (NHTSA 21V213 / GM N202325410).  Unfortunately, my truck is outside the covered population of this recall.  I have scheduled service to inspect my truck and have spoken to GM detailing this event.  I have asked that if my issue is confirmed with DTC codes (I'm sure it will be), will they apply the remedy under recall (ie: no cost to me) and they have said no.  As of right now, I know it's going to cost me $160 for them to inspect the truck, and my guess is well over $1200 for repairs.  My biggest issue is that this is an intermittent electrical issue that will occur again, perhaps at a moment that results in an accident and injury to myself, loved ones with me, and/or others.  I have seen others comment having same truck as mine, also outside the recall window, also have this same incident and get nowhere talking to GM.  I think the recall failed to collect the entire affected population of vehicles defects built",

The Stabilitrak symbol was illuminated the entire time as well on her dash.  She was only about 10 minutes from home and drove home that way, slowly in the slow lane and then on the streets, struggling with the steering the entire time. Unable to pull it in the driveway she left it parked on the street and came in and told me what happened.  Upon restarting the car and test driving it there were no more warnings and the power steering was working as normal. We took it to the dealership to have it checked out as I was very concerned seeing the recall of 2015 Colorado's for power steering issues and numerous reports online about the 2016 having similar issues.  The GM dealership ran their tests and performed a multipoint vehicle inspection but found nothing and were unable to reproduce the issue. My mother does not want to drive the vehicle on the freeway anymore after her experience and is aware to pull over safely on the street if it happens again and shutdown and restart the vehicle to reset the power steering.

THE \"DRIVER INFORMATION CENTER\" IN THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER FLASHED THAT THE AIRBAG, ANTI-THEFT SYSTEM, AND THE TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM (TCS)/STABILITRAK WERE INOPERABLE.  THE AIRBAG, TCS, AND ONE OTHER LIGHTS WERE ILLUMINATED.  I TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF.  WAITED A FEW SECONDS AND TURNED IT BACK ON.  THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN.  I CLEARED THE WARNING MESSAGES AND STARTED TO DRIVE TO TAKE IT IN AND GET IT LOOKED AT BY A CERTIFIED CHEVROLET MECHANIC.  I LEFT THE PARKING LOT AND AFTER ENTERING THE NEARBY STREET I NOTICED THAT THE DRIVER INFORMATION CENTER WAS NOT DISPLAYING ANY VEHICLE INFORMATION (SHOWING ZEROS OR BLANKS FOR ALL DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION INCLUDING MILEAGE, FUEL, OIL PRESSURE, SPEED ETC).  ALSO, THE NEEDLES FOR THE SPEEDOMETER, TACHOMETER, FUEL GAUGE, AND ENGINE COOLANT TEMPERATURE GAUGE WERE LIFELESS AND READING ZEROS.  ONLY THE ODOMETER AND \"INFOTAINMENT\" SYSTEM WERE WORKING CORRECTLY.  I ESTIMATED MY SPEED TO BE ABOVE 30 MPH AT THIS POINT.  I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OFF THE ROAD, PUT THE VEHICLE IN PARK AND TURNED IT OFF.  I WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND SCANNED THE WIRING UNDER THE HOOD AND STEERING WHEEL BUT COULD NOT IDENTIFY ANY ISSUES.  WHEN I STARTED THE VEHICLE AGAIN, ALL THE ISSUES WERE GONE AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED.  SEEMED KINDA LIKE RESTARTING A COMPUTER TO CLEAR SOFTWARE ISSUES.  NOT SURE WHAT COULD'VE CAUSED IT.

THE VEHICLE WILL, DESPITE NORMAL INCREASE IN FUEL PEDAL PRESSURE, LOSE RPM'S FROM APPROXIMATELY 2,000 TO 1,000.  AS IT APPROACHES 1,000 RPM, THE VEHICLE BEGINS TO \"STUTTER\" AND \"LURCH\" AS THE ENGINE TRIES TO COPE WITH THE HIGHER GEAR.

THE END RESULT OF THE NON-MANUAL APPROACH IS TO CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO ACCELERATE  RADICALLY IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF OBSCURED CORNERS AND UPHILL DRIVING.
