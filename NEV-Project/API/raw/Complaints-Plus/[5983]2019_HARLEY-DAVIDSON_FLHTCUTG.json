AFTER SEVERAL TERRIFYING MOMENTS, I DECIDED TO REV THE ENGINE AND SEE IF I COULD MANUALLY SHIFT THE GEARS LOWER. ONE GEAR AT A TIME, WITH TRAFFIC BUILDING BEHIND ME AS I SLOWED DOWN ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY, I GOT THE BIKE INTO 3RD GEAR, PULLED OVER AND PUT ON THE BRAKE, ABRUPTLY KILLING THE ENGINE.  I CAME TO A VERY HARD STOP.      HARLEY DAVIDSON RECALLED THE 2017-2018 HARLEY DAVIDSON TRI GLIDE FOR CLUTCH ISSUES, HOWEVER, THEY DID NOT RECALL THE 2019, WHICH TO MY KNOWLEDGE USES THE SAME HYDRAULIC CLUTCH SYSTEM. MY EXPERIENCE WAS VERY DANGEROUS, AS I WAS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY FROM SHARP CURVES AND IT WAS CRITICAL TO SLOW DOWN BEFORE I CAME TO THOSE CURVES.

I WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY LOST CONTROL AND CRASHED.",
