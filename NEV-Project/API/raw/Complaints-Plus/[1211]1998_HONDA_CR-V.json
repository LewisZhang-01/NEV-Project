MECHANICS HAD DIFFICULTY IN DIAGNOSING THE TROUBLE BECAUSE OF THE IRREGULARITY OF THE QUIXOTIC EVENTS.     DURING THE WEEK OF DECEMBER 8, 2008, THE STALLING OF THE VEHICLE BECAME MORE PERSISTENT, PROMPTING MY DAUGHTER TO RETURN THE VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL GARAGE ONCE AGAIN. UPON FURTHER RESEARCH OF THE MATTER, THE MECHANICS INFORMED HER THAT THE PROBLEM WAS THE CR-V'S KEY LOCK IGNITION SWITCH, AND THAT THE PARTICULAR ITEM FIT THE PARAMTERS OF A HONDA RECALL ITEM.     MY DAUGHTER SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT FOR DECEMBER 13, 2008 AT THE NEAREST HONDA DEALER, SAVANNAH HONDA, WHICH WAS TWO HOURS AWAY.    HOWEVER, ON DECEMBER 9, 2008, THE CR-V EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM THREE TIMES. THE FINAL STALLING-OUT OCCURRENCE RESULTED IN THE VEHICLE'S INABILITY TO BE RESTARTED. THE ENTIRETY OF THIS EVENT WAS OCCASIONED ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY. THE VEHICLE HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE NEAREST GARAGE WHICH, AS NOTED ON THE ATTACHED INVOICE, WAS STATESBORO GARAGE.    THERE, MECHANICS REPLACED THE KEY LOCK IGNITION SWITCH BEFORE THE PRECARIOUS OPERATION OF THE VEHICLE COULD LEAD TO STILL MORE DISASTROUS MISHAPS. THIS RECALL ITEM RESULTED IN A TOTAL BILL OF $245.77 PLUS THE COST OF TOWING.     THOUGH A HONDA OWNER, I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANY NOTIFICATION OF THIS PARTICULAR RECALL. THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM IS TO BE CONSIDERED VERY SERIOUS, AND COULD HAVE RESULTED IN LOSS OF LIFE. I AWAIT YOUR RESPONSE TO THIS VERY SERIOUS MATTER. *TR",

HE DROVE THE CAR FOR A WHILE AND NOTHING HAPPENED. HE SUGGESTED I DRIVE THE CAR AND LET HIM KNOW IF SOMETHING WENT WRONG.  LATER THAT DAY AS I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK SOLDER DROPPED FROM UNDER THE DASH ONTO MY FOOT.  TUESDAY MORNING I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE SAME MECHANIC THAT LOOKED AT IT ON FRIDAY. HE WAS SHOCKED THAT SOMETHING UNDER THE DASH COULD GET THAT HOT AND NOT CATCH ON FIRE. HE LOOKED UNDER THE DASH AND DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS THE IGNITION SWITCH THAT HAD GOT SO HOT THAT IT BEGAN TO MELT THE SOLDER. HE CALLED CALE YARBOROUGH HONDA IN FLORENCE TO GET A NEW IGNITION SWITCH. WE RECEIVED THE PART AND THE MECHANIC PUT IT IN AND THE CAR SEEMS TO BE RUNNING FINE. THE PART THAT STARTLES ME THE MOST IS THAT THE CAR BELONGS TO MY WIFE AND I JUST HAPPENED TO BE DRIVING IT WHEN THE PROBLEMS OCCURRED. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE IS THAT IF MY WIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVING THE CAR AND HOT SOLDER WOULD HAVE FALLEN ON HER FOOT AND BURNED HER IT COULD HAVE POSSIBLY CAUSED HER TO WRECK. SHE ALWAYS WEARS SLIP ON SHOES AND HER FOOT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PROTECTED LIKE MY FOOT WAS. EVEN WITH SHOES ON IT STARTLED ME ENOUGHT TO DRIVE OFF THE ROAD. IT IS DISTURBING TO ME WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF SHE WERE DRIVING THE CAR. I CONTACTED HONDA AND TOLD THEM OF THE INCIDENT AND THEY SAID MY COMPLAINT WOULD GO TO A REVIEW BOARD AND IF IT WARRENTED LOOKING INTO THEY WOULD CONTACT ME.
