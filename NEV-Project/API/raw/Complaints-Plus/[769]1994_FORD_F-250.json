I ESCAPED DANGER ONLY BECAUSE THERE WAS A HEAVY WIND OUT OF THE NW.

THE ONLY THING LEFT UNBURNED WAS THE TWO BACK TIRES.  I HAD JUST DROPPED FULL COVERAGE ON MY TRUCK IN FEB. AFTER I BOUGHT A MOTOR HOME, AS I WAS ONLY PUTTING APPROX. 2000 MILES PER YEAR. ON THE TRUCK.  NOW ALL IS FORGOTTEN AND I HAD TAKEN FULL LOSS ON THIS TRUCK UNTIL I RECEIVED THIS RECALL LETTER FROM FORD MOTOR CO. (05S28). WHAT HAPPENED TO MY TRUCK WAS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL, SO I CONTACTED FORD MOTOR CO. TODAY I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MICHAEL DIRKSEN, CONSUMER AFFAIRS, FORD MOTOR CO., (3136212816) TELLING ME THEY WOULD BE UNABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS CLAIM UNLESS I CAN SOMEHOW GET THIS PILE OF BURNT METAL TO A FORD DEALERSHIP AT MY COST AND HAVE IT REMOVED AT MY COST AFTER THEY SEND SOMEONE DOWN TO THE DEALERSHIP TO LOOK AT IT AND THEN REMOVE THE TRUCK AT MY COST WHEN THEY ARE THROUGH.

THE RIGHT, FRONT TRUCK TIRE BLEW OUT AND THE ASSOCIATED BUMPY/SHUDDERING APPARENTLY CAUSED THE FUEL SHUT OFF VALVE TO CLOSE.  WE WERE ABLE TO PULL OFF THE HIGHWAY, BUT WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY.  WHEN THE FUEL STARVED MOTOR SHUT DOWN WE LOST POWER STEERING AND POWER BRAKES WHICH ADDED TO THE DIFFICULTY CONTROLING THE RIG.  NOBODY WAS INJURED AND WE WERE ABLE TO INSTALL THE SPARE TIRE AND RE-SET THE FUEL VALVE.  OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE FUEL SHUT OFF VALVE MAY HAVE ACTUATED TOO EASILY.
