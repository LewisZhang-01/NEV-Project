THE AIRBAGS NEVER DEPLOYED FROM THE ACCIDENT, ALTHOUGH THE AUTO BODY REPAIR SHOP SAID THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT SUSTAINED.  THE INSURANCE COMPANY REFUSES TO PAY FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE AIRBAG SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY FEEL THAT IF THE AIRBAG DIDN'T DEPLOY, IT WAS DEFECTIVE FROM THE FACTORY.  THEIR LOGIC IS THAT THE IMPACT COULDN'T HAVE CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE AIRBAG SYSTEM.  NISSAN REFUSES TO ABSORB THE COST BECAUSE OUR VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  AT PRESENT, WE ARE STILL WITHOUT OUR VEHICLE.  IT HAS BEEN 3 MONTHS AND THIS IS OUR ONLY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION.",
