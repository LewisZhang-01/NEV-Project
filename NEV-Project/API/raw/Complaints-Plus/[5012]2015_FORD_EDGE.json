I put a little over 9,000 miles and this car needs a new engine,that\u2019s ludicrous.  I did some research once I got home.

I took it to my local mechanic that is Ford trained, and after putting the car up, he indicated that he thought it was a broken Flex Plate.  He said it was good that I had come in because if I had ignored it and been driving on the freeway, my car could have just shut off - which I think we can agree is highly dangerous.  There was never a warning light or any indication of a problem prior to hearing the rattling/knocking sound on June 23rd. My mechanic advised me to call Ford to see if there was anything they would be willing to do as the repair was costly.  I called my local Ford dealership in Irvine, CA on Thursday, June 24th and the service manager said that since it went out of warranty in Oct 2020, that the repair would be out of pocket.  My mechanic then advised me to call Ford Motor Company in Michigan to see if there was anything they could do or provide assistance with. I spoke with \"[XXX]\" at 11:30am, and she advised me that there were no programs available for my vehicle.  I was in disbelief considering there is a recall on the very same part for 2016-2017 Ford Edges.  She apologized and said there was nothing they could do.  She provided a case number #[XXX] and said she would let her engineering department and the NHTSA.  The total cost of the repair was $1,819.64 and the cost of my rental from Enterprise for the 5 days was $611.74.  I have photos of the repair process as well as the actual cracked flexplate part.  This should not happen on a vehicle with 44k miles on it and I certainly should not be footing the bill for it when Ford [XXX] well knows this is a manufacturing problem on their part.

It was only then that we were notified that there was a recall on the hose that may affect the brakes and other functions of the vehicle.  It was replaced. This has now happened a second time while my husband and 2.5 year old were driving home.  If he was not able to have some control over the vehicle he and my child could have been killed or someone else on the road. I called the dealership to let them know that the car would be towed again and told the issue. They confirmed we dealt with this same issue just one year ago and I asked why is this happening and this is so unacceptable as my family's safety is at risk. I asked if there are any recalls or issues with the make and model that we should be aware of. After looking up the vehicle she then informed us there was indeed a recall for the flex hose which could cause leaks and affect the brakes. The vehicle is currently at the dealership being inspected. Due to where the leak is coming from it seems to be the left side of the vehicle now which tells me the dealership only replaced one of the hoses and not both causing this to happen again. This is negligence and I am beyond frustrated at the thought of what could have happened and I don't think waiting until someone is killed is the right time to fix this issue. There were no warning lamps, messages or symptoms prior to the failure, it just happened while driving and trying to stop.",

TOOK TO DEALER ON 2/20/20 AND THE MECHANIC COULD NOT DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. NOISE CONTINUED AT START-UP AND WHEN AT IDLE.    ON 2/25/20 WHILE TRAVELING AT 70 MPH ON THE INTERSTATE, ALL PROPULSIVE POWER WAS LOST YET ENGINE COULD STILL REV AND ALL POWER FUNCTIONS REMAINED (STEERING, BREAKING, AUXILIARY POWER, ETC.). PULLED OFF THE ROAD AND TURNED ENGINE OFF. COULD NOT RE-START VEHICLE AND VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER.   INITIAL INSPECTION SHOWED THAT THE FLEXPLATE HAD SPLIT INTO TWO PIECES. ONE INNER PORTION REMAINED CONNECTED TO THE CRANKSHAFT, THE OTHER OUTER PORTION CONNECTED TO THE TORQUE CONVERTER. (SEE ATTACHED PICTURE OF FLEXPLATE.) DURING THE FAILURE, THE BROKEN FLEXPLATE DESTROYED THE BENDIX GEAR ON THE STARTER WHICH WAS ALSO REPLACED. IN ADDITION, THE CRANKSHAFT SEAL WAS REPLACED WHICH INDICATES AN ALIGNMENT ISSUE MAY BE THE ROOT CAUSE.    THIS IS SIMILAR TO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED COMPLAINTS WITH NHTSA IDS (11218798, 11194165, 111277542, 11204923) AND RELATED TO FORD SERVICE BULLETIN 19-2236 (DATED 06 AUGUST 2019) AS WELL AS FORD COMMUNICATION SSM 47398 (NHTSA ID 10144200). OF THE PREVIOUS COMPLAINTS, TWO HAVE HAD REPEAT FAILURES, LIKELY INDICATING AN INHERENT ALIGNMENT AND ENGINEERING FLAW WITH THE VEHICLE.    NOTE THAT THE 2015 FORD EDGE WAS THE FIRST FORD VEHICLE TO HAVE THE 2ND GENERATION 2.0 L ECOBOOST GTDI WITH TWIN-SCROLL TURBO. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF FLEXPLATE FAILURES AS MORE 2015 - 2018 FORD EDGES REACH THE ~75,000 MILE MARK.    SAFETY COMMENT: THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION AT 70 MPH WHEN I HEARD A LOUD CRACK AND LOST ALL PROPULSIVE POWER.

I WAS HEADING WEST, AND THE SUN WAS BOTHERING ME, SO I MOVED THE PASSENGER SUN VISOR TO BLOCK THE SUN.  WHEN DOING SO, THE VISOR ACCIDENTALLY HIT THE BUTTON WHICH THEN OPENED THE ROOF TO REVEAL THE SUNROOF (GLASS).  I WAS FINE WITH THIS SINCE IT WAS A NICE DAY.  AFTER AROUND 20-30 MINUTES I LOOKED UP AND SAW A COUPLE OF WAVY LINES ON THE SUNROOF GLASS, RUNNING VERTICALLY FROM HOOD-END TO BACK.  I THOUGHT POSSIBLY IT WAS TAR FROM THE ROAD WHICH MAYBE HAD FLOWN UP ON MY ROOF.  AFTER A WHILE, I BECAME MORE CURIOUS ABOUT THE WAVY LINES, SO LOOKED MORE CLOSELY.  THERE WAS IN FACT 3 WAVY LINES (CRACKS) RUNNING VERTICALLY DOWN THE LARGER SECTION OF THE SUNROOF GLASS, WHICH THEN MEET UP WITH A HORIZONTAL WAVY CRACK.  I WAS SHOCKED AND DISMAYED.  I RARELY OPEN THE SUNROOF, SO HAD NO IDEA THE CRACKS WERE THERE, HOW OR WHEN THEY OCCURRED.  MY HUSBAND AND I HAD HAND WASHED THE CAR APPROXIMATELY 1 MONTH AGO, AND DID NOT SEE THESE WAVY CRACKS AT ALL.  AFTER RETURNING HOME, I RESEARCHED THE FORD EDGE SUNROOF ON THE INTERNET.  IT WAS THERE THAT I FOUND THAT MANY MANY OTHER FORD EDGE OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THESE SAME ODD WAVY CRACK(S) IN THEIR SUNROOFS.  OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NO COINCIDENCE.  AND THE FACT THAT THESE CRACKS ARE WAVY, MAKES SENSE THAT THEY WERE CAUSED BY STRESS, AND MORE THAN LIKELY ARE BEING CAUSED BY A MANUFACTURER'S DESIGN FLAW.  I ASK, ALONG WITH MANY OTHER FORD EDGE OWNERS, FOR YOU TO PLEASE RESEARCH THIS PROBLEM.  BY NO FAULT OF MY OWN DID THIS OCCUR.

I WILL END UP FILING A LAWSUIT IF ANYTHING HAPPENS AGAIN. I JUST BOUGHT THIS CAR A YEAR AGO. YOU CANNOT JUSTIFY A $40,000 CAR NOT BEING ABLE TO OPEN OR CLOSE MY DOORS OR TRUNK. GET IT FIGURED OUT OR I WILL BE CONTACTING SOMEONE WHO WILL. I'VE BEEN IN SUPPORT OF FORD SINCE I WAS 16. YOU'RE ABOUT TO LOOSE A VALUABLE CUSTOMER AND I'M ABOUT TO SPREAD THE WORD HOW FORD CANT STAND BEHIND THEIR VEHICLES.",

I SOMEHOW BRAKED AND GOT THE CAR INTO \"PARK\".

THIS WAS ACTUALLY FORTUNATE, BECAUSE 10 FT BEYOND THE DUMPSTER WAS THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING WITH A PERSON SITTING AT A DESK JUST INSIDE A WINDOW THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CRASH POINT. IN ADDITION TO DUMPSTER ENCLOSURE BEING DESTROYED, THE FORD EDGE HIT A 2013 TESLA DRIVER'S SIDE REVIEW MIRROR.     THERE IS NO POLICE REPORT AS THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED ON PRIVATE PROPERTY. HOWEVER, THERE WERE 4 WITNESSES TO THE ACCIDENT, AND ALL AGREED THAT \"I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT, AND THANK GOD NO WAS INJURED OR EVEN KILLED\"    I WAS NOT INJURED, JUST SHAKEN UP.    I CONTACTED THE FORD MOTOR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP DEPT ON APRIL 9 TO REPORT THE MECHANICAL MALFUNCTION, AND WAS ASSIGNED A CASE NUMBER: CAS14557623. AND WAS TOLD BY LAW THAT THE FORD OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL HAD 15 BUSINESS DAYS TO RESPOND IN WRITING.    THE STATE FARM APPROVED BODY SHOP ESTIMATED REPAIRS AT APPROX $9,600.

WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK OF DRIVING THIS VEHICLE, I TRIED TO BACK UP FROM A PARKING SPACE. A PEDESTRIAN WAS WALKING DIRECTLY BEHIND THE RIGHT REAR OF THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE STARTED REARWARD AND HIT THE PEDESTRIAN WITHOUT ANY AUDIBLE WARNING. THE PEDESTRIAN CONTINUED TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE VEHICLE, GAVE ME A DISGUSTING LOOK AND WALKED AWAY  I RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO THE FORD DEALER COMPLAINING ABOUT THE BACKUP SYSTEM AND WE TESTED TWO OTHER NEW EDGE'S. THEY PERFORMED THE SAME WAY. THE OWNER'S MANUAL OUTLINES THE SAME BACKUP PROCEDURE AS I DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE DEALER EXPLAINED THAT THIS SYSTEM WAS NEW AND ONLY ON THE 2015 AND BEYOND EDGE.  I THINK THIS SYSTEM IS POORLY DESIGNED COMPARED TO OTHER FORD VEHICLES. I ALSO HAVE A 2016 EXPLORER WITH A REAR BACKUP SYSTEM. AN AUDIBLE WARNING SOUNDS EVERY TIME SOMETHING IS WITHIN THE BACKUP ZONE I.E. STANDING STILL, LATERAL MOVEMENT, APPROACHING, ETC.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME TYPE OF INVESTIGATION INTO THIS MATTER.

I SHOWED THEM RESEARCH WHERE OTHER CUSTOMERS COMPLAINED OF THIS ISSUE AND IT BEING DUE TO THE THROTTLE BODY. I ASKED FOR THIS TO BE REPLACED, AND AFTER 5 DAYS OF BACK AND FORTH, THEY CHANGED IT OUT. LESS THAN 24 HOURS LATER IT HAPPENED FOR THE THIRD TIME AND I TOOK IT BACK IN. I MENTIONED OTHER REPORTS OF POSSIBLE FUEL PUMP ISSUES BUT THEY SAID THEY WERE UNAWARE OF IT BEING AN ISSUE. THE SAID THEY WOULD TRY TO DUPLICATE IT, BUT OTHERWISE THEY COULDN'T DO MUCH ELSE. I BROUGHT IN A PICTURE OF THE ALERT, AS REQUESTED BY THE FIRST MECHANIC, BUT WAS TOLD IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO HELP THEM. I AM UNABLE TO ATTACH THE WORK ORDER AT THIS TIME, BUT I HAVE A PHYSICAL COPY FOR MY RECORDS.",
