IT HAS ALSO SHUT OFF WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO PASS IN THE LEFT LANE WHILE ACCELERATING ON THE HIGHWAY. IT ALSO HAS SOMETHING CALLED A HOT NON-START - THIS MEANS - IT WILL NOT START WHEN THE ENGINE IS HOT.

I HAVE BEEN STUCK NUMEROUS TIMES IN TRAFFIC AND THEN THE CAR UNABLE TO START. ALSO AS A RESULT OF THIS HOT NON-START- YOU HAVE TO FUEL YOUR CAR WITH IT RUNNING OR YOU WILL HAVE TO SIT AND WAIT AT THE GAS PUMP FOR 20 MINUTES BEFORE IT CAN START. THIS HAS OCCURRED BEFORE THEY REPLACED MY ENGINE FROM 2009 THRU 2011 AND NOW WITH A NEW ENGINE FROM 2012 THRU 2015 THEY ALSO NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED FOR FRAUD. I LEASED MY CAR FOR 3 YEARS. I THEN PURCHASED IT AND FINANCED IT FOR 5 YEARS IN 2008. MAZDA KNEW THESE ENGINES WERE FLAWED - BUT THEY WERE STILL SELLING THEM TO PEOPLE WHEN THIS ENGINE ISSUE HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE 2005.

MY SPEED WENT DOWN10-15 MPH AND ALTHOUGH I TRIED TO ACCELERATE IT WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING. I PULLED OVER TO THE SHOULDER AND TRIED TO EXIT BUT CAR REFUSED TO GO INTO GEAR. EVERY TIME I FORCED IT INTO GEAR, THE CAR WOULD CONSTANTLY STALL AND DIE. I HAD THE IGNITION COIL AND SPARK PLUG REPLACED BUT NOW THE CLUTCH JUST SINKS TO THE FLOOR. I'VE TRIED TO PUMP THE CLUTCH TO GET IT INTO GEAR BUT THIS IS QUITE DANGEROUS ON THE ROAD. MY VEHICLE HAS TROUBLE CONTROLLING ITS SPEED SINCE THERE'S A LAG SWITCHING FROM 3RD TO 4TH, 5TH TO 6TH SINCE I HAVE TO PUMP MY SUNKEN CLUTCH SEVERAL TIMES AND FIDDLE WITH THE SHIFTER TO ACTUALLY KICK MY CAR INTO THE NEXT GEAR. MY CAR IS NOW OVER 100K MILES AND JUST READ ABOUT THE MAZDA RX8 CLUTCH PEDAL RECALL ONLINE.   THIS MALFUNCTION/SAFETY ISSUE WAS NEVER ANNOUNCED PROFESSIONALLY BY MY DEALER. MAZDA HAD NO PROBLEMS CONTACTING ME VIA PHONE, EMAIL ,MAIL REGARDING BILLS BUT FOR SOME REASON FAILED TO GIVE ME A NOTICE REGARDING THIS DEFECT. I'VE BEEN ADVISED THAT REPAIRING THIS PROBLEM IS QUITE EXPENSIVE AND SINCE MY CAR ALTHOUGH LESS THAN 8 YEARS OLD HAS PASSED THE EXTENDED WARRANTY BASED ON MILEAGE, I'LL BE STUCK DRIVING THIS CAR WITHOUT PROPER REPAIRS? I FEEL MAZDA SHOULD'VE CONTACTED ALL RX8 OWNERS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER ANY FUTURE DISASTERS. WOULD THERE BE ANY CHANCE TO EXTEND THE WARRANTY FOR THE CLUTCH PEDAL BASED ON MILEAGE OVER 120K? I CAN'T AFFORD TO PURCHASE A NEW CAR AT THIS MOMENT BUT NEED TO STILL COMMUTE TO WORK WITHOUT PAYING FOR REPAIRS THAT WOULD COST ME AN ARM AND A LEG AT THE DEALER? IF THIS IS A RECALL ISSUE, I WOULD FEEL MORE SAFE HAVING AN AUTHORIZED DEALER INSPECT THE PROBLEM RATHER THAN A CHEAP AUTO SHOP THAT ISN'T FULLY AWARE OF SPECIFIC DETAILS.  *TR",

IN ORDER TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS, THE HEADLIGHTS HAVE A \"CUTOFF\" THAT PREVENT BLINDING ONCOMING DRIVERS, WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS REQUIRED BY LAW.  THE HEADLIGHTS ON THIS VEHICLE HAVE AN AUTOLEVELING FUNCTION WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO LEVEL THE HEADLIGHTS AT THE PROPER HEIGHT DEPENDENT ON THE POSITION OF THE CAR'S SUSPENSION.  THE HEADLIGHT LEVELERS ARE CONTROLLED BY TWO SENSORS, ONE ON THE DRIVERS SIDE FRONT AND ONE ON THE DRIVER SIDE REAR WHEEL HUB, CONNECTED TO THE SUSPENSION COMPONENTS.  THERE IS A KNOWN DEFECT WITH THESE SENSORS WHICH CAUSES THE HEADLIGHT LEVELERS TO MALFUNCTION, AIMING THE HEADLIGHTS EITHER TOO LOW (WHICH CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT IN THE RX-8) OR TOO HIGH (WHICH CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT BY BLINDING ONCOMING TRAFFIC).  THERE IS AN ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR LOCATED BENEATH THE CAR AT EACH SENSOR THAT MOISTURE CAN GET INSIDE, CAUSING CORROSION.  THIS CAUSES THE SENSORS TO FAIL AND THE HEADLIGHTS WILL AUTO-AIM THEMSELVES IN ANY ORIENTATION, AND THIS CANNOT BE OVERRIDDEN...I KNOW, I HAVE TRIED REPEATEDLY TO MANUALLY RE-AIM THEM MYSELF.  MANUALLY RESETTING THE HEADLIGHTS WILL ONLY CAUSE THE HEADLIGHTS TO MIS-AIM THEMSELVES AGAIN WHEN THE CAR IS RESTARTED AND THE SENSORS RETURN FAULTY SIGNALS.  CURRENTLY, MY HEADLIGHTS ARE AIMED FAR TOO HIGH FOR ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND I ROUTINELY GET \"FLASHED\" BY OTHER DRIVERS.  DRIVING MY CAR AT NIGHT IS UNSAFE FOR MYSELF AND OTHER DRIVERS DUE TO THIS DEFECT.  AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED, THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE AND THERE HAVE BEEN APPARENTLY ENOUGH COMPLAINTS ABOUT IT THAT MAZDA HAS ISSUED A TECHNICAL BULLETIN ON THIS DEFECT, AND THE LEVELERS HAVE BEEN RE-ENGINEERED TO USE MORE HEAVY-DUTY CONNECTORS.  I WOULD URGE THE NHTSA TO EVALUATE THIS ISSUE AND COMPEL MAZDA TO ISSUE A RECALL FOR THIS DEFECT ASAP.  THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION!

IT FELT A LITTLE SOFTER AFTER THE \"POP\" SOUND. I THOUGHT SOMETHING HAD BROKEN  BUT COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING AND THE CLUTCH SEEMED TO WORK OK. HOWEVER, OVER THE NEXT 30 DAYS, IT BECAME HARDER AND HARDER TO GET THE MANUAL TRANSMISSION INTO REVERSE.

THE DEALER INFORMED ME THE CLUTCH PEDAL ASSEMBLY BRACKET WAS BROKEN AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE QUOTE WAS OVER $500 SO I SAID I WOULD  BRING THE CAR BACK IN WHEN I HAD THE MONEY. HOWEVER, WHEN I DROVE AWAY I COULD NOT SHIFT OUT OF 1ST GEAR AND THE CAR WAS NOT DRIVABLE.  I IMMEDIATELY DROVE BACK TO THE DEALER IN 1ST GEAR AND ASKED THEM TO ORDER THE PART AND REPLACE THE CLUTCH PEDAL ASSEMBLY BRACKET. WHEN THE CLUTCH PEDAL ASSEMBLY WAS REPLACED, THE CAR SHIFTED FINE.

I HAVE THE OLD CLUTCH PEDAL ASSEMBLY BRACKET AND CAN SEND IT TO NHTSA FOR INSPECTION. I BELIEVE MAZDA NEEDS TO RECALL THE CARS AND REPLACE THE CLUTCH PEDAL ASSEMBLY WITH A BETTER CONSTRUCTED SYSTEM.

THE CAR WAS NOT IN USE UNTIL THE END OF SEPTEMBER 2009. ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2009 THE CAR HAD A FAILURE AND I COULD SEE SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE CAR AND THE CAR TURNED OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY. I COULD SMELL BURNT PLASTIC AND SAW MELTED PLASTIC COMING BELOW THE CAR. THE DAY ALL THIS HAPPENED, IT WAS RAINING SO THE CAR WAS PROTECTED FROM A FIRE DUE TO THE RAIN. I GOT PICTURES OF SOME OF THE MELTED PARTS. AFTER THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER THEY TOLD ME THAT THE HEAT PRODUCED BY THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER BURNED THE NEW SPARK PLUGS, THE SPARK PLUGS CABLES, THE MODULES AND THAT THERE WAS ASH ON THE SYSTEM THAT NEEDED TO BE CLEANED. THEY DO NOT WANT TO REPLACE ALL THE PARTS THAT BURNED AT THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE FAULTY CATALYTIC CONVERTER SINCE MY CAR GUARANTEE WAS NO LONGER VALID. THEY DID NOT MAKE ANY EFFORTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM KNOWING THAT ALL THE DAMAGES WERE DUE TO THE FAULTY CONDITION OF THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER. THEY WILL ONLY PROVIDE A NEW CATALYTIC CONVERTER ($1500.00 COST) BUT I HAVE TO PAY ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT FOR THE REST OF THE DAMAGE.

AFTER CONTACTING CORPORATE HQ ABOUT THIS PROBLEM THE DEALERSHIP TESTED THE ENGINE WHICH PASSED BY A MINIMAL PERCENT, JUST ENOUGH NOT TO REPLACE THE ENGINE UNDER WARRANTY.  AFTER SOME PERSONAL RESEARCH ON THIS MATTER, I'VE FOUND HUNDREDS OF OTHER RX8 OWNERS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH LITTLE OR NO HELP FROM MAZDA OTHER THAN REPLACING THE DAMAGED ENGINE WITH THE SAME MODEL OF FAULTY ENGINE.

OBVIOUSLY THERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH THESE ENGINES AND I THINK THEY ARE UNSAFE.  MAZDA HAS ADDED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY TO THESE ENGINES FOR UP TO 100,000 MILES BUT THAT DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF THESE ENGINES FAILING WHILE IN MOTION OR IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY INTERSECTION.
