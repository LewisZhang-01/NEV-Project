When I asked the Audi service agent , he states that the car does not typically make it to a 10,000 mile interval because of the large engine. Over the past 5 years the interval to add one quart of oil has been less and less. It has gone from ~9500, 7500, 3000 intervals. On July 22, 2021 I took my car in for the 80,000 mile service.

I called the my local Audi Service and was advised to come in for an oil consumption test. I also notified the National Audi Customer Service line to voice my concern for my car. I inquired if oil consumption is a known issue in the Audi Q7 2017. There was not a clear admission of this concern in their vehicles but it made me concern that this could be an issue because of historical issues with Audi's early consumption of oil.
