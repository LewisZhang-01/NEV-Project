He said that this car alone has kept them in service with as many repairs they have to do for these cars.  My car was the fourth Chevy Cruze there that day that had some type of liquid leaking from under the hood. If this is that well known an issue with these type of cars then chevy should have a recall to fix this obvious malfunction so i wanted to make sure i Made a complaint on this in case others had not.",

THE PASSENGER SIDE WIPER THEN BECAME ENTANGLED WITH THE \"STUCK\" DRIVER SIDE WIPER AND ACTUALLY CAUSED IT TO FLIP UP AND OVER, THUS RENDERING BOTH WIPERS USELESS AND ME UNABLE TO SEE WHERE I WAS DRIVING DURING A HEAVY RAINY / FOGGY NIGHT! I MANAGED TO PULL INTO A PLAZA SAFELY TO FLIP MY PASSENGER SIDE BACK TO ITS PROPER POSITION. WHEN I CHECKED THE DRIVER SIDE WIPER THE COMPLETE ARM THAT ATTACHED TO THE MOTOR WAS LOOSE AND IT WOULD NOT STAY IN THE CORRECT \"STARTING / FINISHING\" POSITIONS AND I COULD PUSH/PULL IT UP AND DOWN INTO DIFFERENT POSITIONS BUT AFTER ONE WIPE IT WOULD BOTTOM OUT ON THE BOTTOM OF MY WINDSHIELD/COWL BACK INTO THE INCORRECT POSITION WHERE IT INTERFERES WITH THE PASSENGER SIDE WIPER. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN AS I COULD NOT SEE WHERE I WAS GOING AND NOW MY WIPERS ARE USELESS BECAUSE EVEN IF I USE IT FOR A SINGLE WIPE IT GETS ASS TANGLED UP. SEE THE ATTACHED IMAGE OF THE PASSENGER WIPER THAT IS FLIPPED UPSIDE DOWN FROM NORMAL USE DURING HEAVY RAIN! I USED TO INSTALL THESE WIPER ASSEMBLY AT GM AND I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THIS ONE IS NOT TORQUED TO SPECS BECAUSE I CAN MOVE IT BY HAND! AND THE WIPER BLADES ARE LIKELY EATEN UP NOW TOO FROM CLEANING ON AND OFF THE GLASS, ONTO TO COWL AND OVER TOP EACH OTHER. NOT TO MENTION THE BOLT THAT ATTACHES IT TO THE MOTOR IS LIKELY STRIPPED UP NOW FROM THE FREE SPINNING MOVEMENTS....",

WHILE IN HEAVY TRAFFIC THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM STARTED TO TELL HER TO TURN LEFT AND RIGHT IN ERROR BECAUSE IT WAS SHOWING US ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET OFF THE HIGHWAY ON SMALL SERVICE ROADS. IT WAS INCORRECTLY TRYING TO ROUTE US BACK TO WHERE WE WERE ALREADY. THIS WAS CONFUSING FOR HER AND CAUSED HER TO SLOW DOWN IN TRAFFIC AND BECOME DISTRACTED CAUSING A SAFETY HAZARD AS SHE HAD TO IGNORE DIRECTIONS FROM THE SCREEN POPPING UP AND THE SPEAKER AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO GO. THIS PROBLEM HAS OCCURED SEVERAL TIMES WHEN USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM. WE TOOK THE CAR TO GM DEALERSHIP AND THEY GAVE US A DOCUMENT FROM GM #PIC6057A DATED APRIL 27, 2015. THIS SAYS THIS PROBLEM IS COMMON WITH 2015 BUICK ENCORE AND VERANO,  2015 CHEVY CAMARO, CRUZE, EQUINOX, MALIBU, SS AND VOLT AND FINALLY THE 2015 GMC TERRAIN WITH THE NAVI. IT SAYS THE NAVI CAN BE OFF BY 20-50 METERS. IT FINALLY SAYS THIS IS THE NORMAL OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE VEHICLE AND WILL NOT IMPACT PERFORMANCE. I BELIEVE THIS IS NOT NORMAL AND COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT WHEN DRIVERS ARE IN TRAFFIC AND LISTENING TO THE NAVI THAT IS CONFUSED BY READING THE WRONG LOCATION. THIS ERROR/PROBLEM SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED NORMAL OPERATING CONDITION AND ONLY SHARED WITH DEALERS FOR CUSTOMERS THAT COMPLAIN. THIS SHOULD BE SHARED WITH OWNERS AND THE AFFECTED VEHICLES SHOULD BE RECALLED FOR A FIX BEFORE THE PROBLEM  CAUSES AN ACCIDENT OR INJURY.",
