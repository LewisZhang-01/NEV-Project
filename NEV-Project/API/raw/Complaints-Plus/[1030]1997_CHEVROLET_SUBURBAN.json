I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE HYDROBOOST THREE TIMES IN 8 MONTHS. I COMPLETELY REMOVED THE SOLENOID  MAGNET FROM THE POWER STEERING PUMP TO TEST IF THE POWER STEERING PUMP CAUSES THE HYDRO BOOST UNIT TO FAIL, I DID THIS BETWEEN HYDRO UNIT 1 AN 2, I REINSTALLED MAGNET BETWEEN UNIT 2 AND 3 THE FIRST TIME I LOST BRAKING AND STEERING THERE WAS NO WARNING, I WENT TO STOP  AND HAD HARD, NON POWER BRAKES AND NO POWER STEERING.  THE SECOND, THIRD TIME I KNEW TO REPLACE THE HYDROBOOST UNIT, WHEN BRAKING AND  TURNING THE STEERING GETS HARD OR THE BRAKES GET HARD, THEN I REPLACE THE HYDROBOOST UNIT, BRAKE AND STEERING RETURN TO NORMAL  I COMPLETELY FLUSHED THE POWER STEERING FLUID EACH TIME INTO A CLEAN BUCKET, NO BIG PARTICLES OR HOSE MATERIAL.  THIS BRAKING SYSTEM IS DANGEROUS, IMAGINE DRIVING DOWN A WINDING TWO LANE STEEP  DOWNHILL MOUNTAIN ROAD, WITH A HEAVY SUBURBAN AND YOU LOOSE STEERING AND BRAKES  I TURNED IN THE ORIGINAL PARTS AS CORES TO GET MY MONEY BACK.  *NM",

AUGUST OF 2003, THE PUMP FAILED WHILE DRIVING IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD & WAS REPLACED WHEN THE MILEAGE WAS AT 116,503, UNDER FACTORY WARRANTY. JUNE 27, 2004, AND MILEAGE OF 128,300 (11,800 MILES LATER) THE PUMP HAS FAILED AGAIN. THE PUMP FAILED ON A VERY BUSY & DARK STREET AT NIGHTTIME ON A BEND IN THE ROAD AS I WAS DRIVING HOME WITH MY WIFE & TWO KIDS IN THE CAR.  WHEN IT FAILED THE ENGINE DIED AND WE WERE STUCK IN TRAFFIC. THE CAR IS BLACK AND IT WAS DARK, UNABLE TO MOVE, WE WERE ALMOST REAR ENDED BY SEVERAL CARS COMING UP THE HILL AND ROUNDING THE BEND IN THE ROAD. EVENTUALLY I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR STARTED AND IT RAN JUST ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME TO GET THE CAR OUT OF HARM'S WAY BEFORE DYING AGAIN. I THEN HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT HAD PERFORMED THE LAST FUEL INJECTION PUMP. AT THIS POINT, IT IS STILL IN THE SHOP AND THE SERVICE WRITER TOLD ME THAT INJECTION PUMP HAD GONE BAD AND THAT HE IS CURRENTLY WAITING FOR WARRANTY APPROVAL FOR REPLACEMENT AS WELL AS THE NEW PUMP ITSELF TO ARRIVE.

APPARENTLY, THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM THAT GM SHOULD RESOLVE. TO DATE, GM HAS ONLY INCREASED THE FACTORY WARRANTY FROM 100,000 MILES TO 120,000 IN AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE GOOD. THIS IS STILL A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE WHEN YOU LOSE POWER AND BECOME A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD IN TRAFFIC. GM NEEDS TO COME UP WITH A PERMANENT FIX THAT PREVENTS THIS FROM HAPPENING AGAIN, NOT JUST ONE THAT LASTS FOR A FEW MILES AND THEN HAPPEN ALL OVER AGAIN.    *NM",

THE MIL INDICATOR (I.E., \u001cCHECK ENGINE LIGHT\u001d) HAD A CODE OF P1870 (TRANSMISSION SLIPPING).  THIS CODE HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HUNDREDS OF TORQUE CONVERTER CLUTCH RELAY FAILURES IN GM/CHEVY FULL-SIZE PICK-UPS, SUBURBANS, AND TAHOES (DISCOVERED BY SEARCHING FOR \"P1870\" ON THE INTERNET AND QUERIES AT THE NHTSA WEBSITE).   TECHNICIANS HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE TCC RELAY IS UNDERSIZED AND TENDS TO OVERHEAT CAUSING MAJOR TRANSMISSION DAMAGE (IN MY CASE, A FULL TRANSMISSION RE-BUILD WAS REQUIRED - $2000 PLUS TOWING AND RENTAL CAR).  TECHNICIANS SAY THAT THERE IS AN AFTERMARKET TCC RELAY MADE BY SONNAX THAT, WHEN INSTALLED, PREVENTS THIS PROBLEM FROM OCCURRING.    THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE (JUST LOOK AT THE BLACK CHARRING ON THE BOTTOM OF MY GAS TANK SHIELD) THAT CAUSED GREAT PERIL TO MY WIFE, FOUR CHILDREN, AND MYSELF.  GM NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO CORRECT THIS POTENTIALLY FATAL FAILURE.*AK",

MY VEHICLE WOULD ALL OF A SUDDEN HAVE A VERY LOOSE FEELING IN THE CONTROL OF THE STEERING.  THINKING IT WAS JUST ME, I DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT FOR AWHILE.  I HAD TIRES PUT ON MY CAR AND THE STEERING FELT DIFFERENT (GOOD), I THOUGHT MAYBE IT HAD SOMETHING TO WITH TIRES AND IT WAS FIXED.

WE LIVE IN A RURAL AREA 40 MILES FROM OUR DEALER AND BY  THE TIME I REALIZED THE PROBLEM WAS NOT NORMAL, AND I WOULD HAVE TO GIVE MY VEHICLE UP FOR A FEW DAYS, MY  CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY (MILEAGE)  SO I TOOK IT TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC THAT I USE, THEY DROVE IT AROUND ON THEIR ERRANDS FOR ABOUT TWO DAYS AND IT FINALLY DID IT FOR THEM.  THEY WERE THINKING THEY WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE GEAR BOX, BUT THEY CALLED GM TO CONSULT ABOUT THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY NEVER HAD SEEN THIS PROBLEM AND THEY TOLD THEM ABOUT STEERING SENSOR PROBLEMS.

TWO MORE ATTEMPTS WERE MADE,THE FINAL ONE RESULTED IN ALL OF THE SERVICE MANAGER'S STEERING COMPONENTS BEING REMOVED FROM HIS 98 TRUCK AND PLACED ON THE SUBURBAN. THE STEERING WAS BETTER BUT POOR COMPARED TO THE 95 AND 93 SUBURBAN. TODAY THE VEHICLE IS STILL SCARY TO DRIVE ON RUTTED WET ROADS AT SPEED. JUST RECENTLY A CHIP FAILED IN THE STEERING WHEN TURNING LEFT, CAUSING OVER CORRECTION INTO OTHER LANES. THE DEALER SAID THIS HAD HAPPENED IN OTHER VEHICLES AND REPAIRED THE VEHICLE.

TOOK TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY REPLACED THE FRONT PADS. THEN 2MONTHS LATER,IN FEBRUARY, 98 SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. I BECAME CONCERNED AS TO WHY THIS WAS HAPPENING. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON EVERY 2-3 MONTH SINCE, AND WE ARE NOW  IN APRIL, 99 AND I AM STILL HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. LUCKY TO GET 1-2 THOUSAND MILES ON THE PADS. HAVE BEEN TO DEALER APPROXIMATELY 10 TIMES  FOR THIS. DEALER WAS CONCERNED AS TO WHY THEY WERE WEARING SO QUICK. NOW 4-5 SETS IN THIS SHORT OF TIME. THE LAST TWO TIMES I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THEM I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP WITH THEM STILL SQUEAKING, AND I WANTED TO HAVE FIXED. NOW ADDED TO THIS PROBLEM IS THE FRONT END PULLING TO THE LEFT FRONT WHEN YOU APPLY THE BRAKES, AND WHEN IT IS RAINING OUT THE VEHICLE HOPS ALL OVER THE ROAD WHEN YOU TRY TO STOP. IT IS VERY SCARY. THIS IS NOW A MAJOR CONCERN, AND I AM AFRAID IT COULD BE DANGEROUS. IM  MARCH ,99 I BROUGHT BACK TO SERVICE MANAGER FOR THE SQUEAK, PULL OF THE FRONT END. WHEN I LEFT THAT DAY VEHICLE HAD NOTHING DONE TO IT. SERVICE MANAGER SAID HE WOULD CONTACT GMC REP.HAVE HIM COME OUT MAYBE HE COULD RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. THIS WAS ON MAR3,1999. I WAITED TILL APR 8,1999, DORIAN TAFT GMC REP. CAME OUT. I REQUESTED IN WRITING THAT I BE PRESENT WHEN HE WAS OUT SO WE COULD DISCUSS MY CONCERNS. I WAS NEVER CALLED, I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP AFTER WORK SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MANAGER WHO INFORMED ME THAT THE GMC REP WAS IN A HURRY DIDNT HAVE TIME TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE WITH ME OR CHECK MY VEHICLE OUT LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN,AND THAT WAS WHOLE PURPOSE. IM VERY UPSET AND THIS IS TOTALLY UNSAT. MY VEHICLE CONCERNS PROBLEMS STILL STAND.I BELIEVE THIS IS VERY UNSAFE & THINK THE PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND TAKEN CARE OF NOW. LONGEST SET OF PADS LASTED APPROX 2000 MILES. FRONT RIMS ARE A CONSTANT BLACK. PLEASE HELP ME OUT.  *AK",
