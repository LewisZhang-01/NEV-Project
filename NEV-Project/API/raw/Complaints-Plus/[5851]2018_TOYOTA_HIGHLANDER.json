I also called the Toyota Corporation and they said since my VIN number wasn't specifically affected, it's not part of the recall.

When this incident took place? 09/11/2021 \u2013 around 10.30am Who is travelling with you? I was travelling with my wife (Vijaya) and Pet Dog (Leo). Both my wife and I have the seat belts on. How are the driving conditions? A bright and sunny morning with clear visibility, minimal wind and no rain. The road is totally dry. In a way perfect driving condition.  How the incident happened? A white truck came in the opposite direction and since the road is narrow I pulled my highlander to the right, where there is some loose gravel on the side of the road. When I pulled to the side I am almost at a standstill and after the truck had passed started moving the car towards the middle of the road. At this moment the Highlander suddenly started swiveling to the left, and the traction became very wobbly and when tried to apply brakes, brake did not work at all. In stead the car started going out of control on the left side and is about to crash into 2 large trees on the side of the car. At that time without having any control over the brakes, I tried to steer towards right and the car turned sharp towards right, crossed road and fell into a 15 feet ditch on the right side of the car. What is the Car behavior witnessed? Total loss of Breaks, self-acceleration, and unpredictable steering control. The whole incident might\u2019ve happened in about 10-15 seconds. Neither the auto-braking nor the collision control has triggered. Not sure what triggered this behavior of the car. It appeared as if the car tried to auto-correct the traction and something malfunctioned.",

After navigating to the side of the road a warning light appeared that said traction control is off.   I called World Toyota, told them what happened and they suggested that I get the vehicle towed if I felt I couldn\u2019t drive it. I was about 1/4 mile away from the dealer. The vehicle was a safety hazard, therefore, I had the vehicle towed to the dealer.   On July 28, the World Toyota service advisor informed me that 2 of the 6 fuel injectors had failed\u2014#s1 and 4. He advised me the best route would be to replace all 6 at a cost of $3500. He agreed with me that it is odd for fuel injectors to  fail on a vehicle with only 48K. We have driven this car very little since purchasing shortly before the COVID lock down in early 2020.  I spoke with customer relations at Toyota and they have offered to pay to replace the 2 failed injectors, but have refused to pay the installation costs.

This is a very expensive maintenance item (>$600 in parts, ~$1000 including labor and shop materials), that needs to be performed by a Toyota certified technician.  In addition to being very expensive, what will discourage many vehicle owners from performing this service, one may expect that many owners who perform their own vehicle maintenance or use independent mechanic shops will simply miss this service altogether.  Being a safety critical item, the vacuum pump should be designed to last the entire lifespan of the vehicle (just like other brake system components: ABS pump, vacuum booster, master cylinder, etc.).  The short lifespan of the vacuum pump and the requirement to replace it on a regular basis is indicative of a defective or deficient design.  Making the replacement of the vacuum pump a scheduled maintenance item is a just way for Toyota to avoid liability due to premature failures of a substandard safety component, especially in light that other brake system components are designed to last for the entire life of the vehicle, and are not considered wear items in the maintenance schedule (except for brake pads, of course).  Toyota should redesign the vacuum pump to increase its lifespan in-line with the rest of the brake system components, and perform the replacement under a safety recall or service campaign, at no cost to vehicle owners.",

However, the Highlander's towing wire harness does not include the necessary wiring and 7-pin connector to power trailer brakes.

Toyota's claim that the Highlander is capable of towing 5000 lb, but not equipping the car with essential safety equipment to do so is an unsafe condition (and false advertising).  It could lead the car owners / operators to believe that it is acceptable to tow a 3000 lb or more trailer with the Highlander using the OEM 4-pin connector only, creating a serious safety hazard to themselves and other road users.  Toyota should either equip the Highlander with proper wiring harness and 7-pin connector that allows the use of an on-board brake controller, or withdraw the towing capacity claim.",

WHEN TEMP SET ON, E.G. 69 TEMP IN CAR IS ~76-80.  WHEN AIRFLOW SHOWS THE FLOW AIMED AT WINDSHIELD & FEET, MOST OF THE AIR FLOW COMES TO MY TORSO WITH MINIMAL FLOW TO OTHER 2 SITES.  3) NEED COFFEE BREAK MESSAGE: HAS COME ON TWICE WHEN ON A LONG TRIP, DISAPPEARING AFTER ~ A MINUTE, BUT SEVERAL TIMES CAME ON AFTER DRIVING ONLY 2-4 MILES.   4) FAULTY RESUMPTION OF SPEED: WHEN THE SPEED CONTROL WAS SET AT 50 MPH (ONCE) OR 60 MPH (ONCE) AND I TOGGLED THE CONTROL TO RESUME SET SPEED THE CAR SPED UP WELL BEYOND WHAT IT WAS SET AT. I HAD TO DISENGAGE THE SPEED CONTROLLER TO STOP THE ACCELERATION. HAPPENED AGAIN ~3 WEEKS AGO WHEN SPEED SET AT 35, AND WHEN I TOGGLED IT RESUME SPEED IT ROARED AHEAD UNTIL IT REACHED 45 MPH.   5) DOOR HANDLE LOCKING MECHANISM; NOT AS SENSITIVE TO LOCKING WHEN TOUCHED AS IT WAS WHEN CAR WAS NEW. UNLOCKING WHEN TOUCHING HANDLE WORKS FINE.  6) MOTOR TURNOFF WHEN AT STOPLIGHT: SELDOM WORKS.  WHEN IT DOES IT TURNS ITSELF OFF AFTER AS LITTLE AS 30 SECONDS EVEN THO PRESSURE ON BRAKE PEDAL IS CONSTANT.  8) (NON-ELECTRONIC PROBLEM) THE TRANSPARENT PLASTIC COVER OVER THE DASH CONTROL SETTINGS IS DETERIORATING - - CAN?T SEE THRU IT VERY WELL IN CERTAIN WAYS THE LIGHT HITS IT   9) SPEEDOMETER READING PROBLEM: WHEN CRUISE CONTROL IS WORKING, THE DIGITAL READOUT FOR THE SPEED IS USUALLY 1-2 MPH LOWER THAN WHAT THE SPEEDOMETER DIAL SAYS IT IS.

I HAD THE VISOR CLOSED ON THE MOONROOF SO NO GLASS ENTERED THE CABIN.  THE ENTIRE MOONROOF SHATTERED AND THERE WAS A HOLE TOWARDS THE REAR OF THE MOONROOF.  IT WAS A CLEAR DAY AND THE PAVEMENT WAS LEVEL.  I DID NOT SEE ANY OBJECTS FROM THE ROAD APPROACH MY CAR PRIOR TO THE MOONROOF SHATTERING.

I LEARNED FROM RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS INCIDENTS OF SHATTERING SUNROOFS/MOONROOFS INVOLVING MULTIPLE MANUFACTURERS.  I REPORTED THE SITUATION TO TOYOTA'S NATIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER.  I EXPRESSED MY CONCERN ABOUT HOW THE MOONROOF CAN SHATTER ON THE SUNROOF WHEN I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THAT TYPE OF DAMAGE AND THAT I WAS AWARE THAT TOYOTA AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS HAD EXPERIENCED PROBLEMS WITH SUNROOFS/MOONROOFS.
