        "summary": "I have been noticing since the beginning to middle of March 2022 the truck has been stalling while driving. It has happened 4 times since that time. Twice while in traffic and twice while driving on the highway. You have to come to a complete stop, put the vehicle in park and start the vehicle again. One time it happened we were almost rear ended by a semi truck driving behind us. Along with that, the Air Bag malfunction light has been coming on and off every few days. The fuel gauge has been showing all different fuel amounts as well every day. The truck has been a Toyota dealer for the past week and been communicating with Toyota engineers and I have been told by the service advisor Toyota is aware of these problems but do not have a fix. My family is terrified to drive the truck any longer and is a very dangerous and serious problem. I am not the only one who is experiencing this based on my own research. I did tell my dealer to document this on my record in detail as if anything happens to my family because of an engineering error I will take this to the highest level ever seen.",
