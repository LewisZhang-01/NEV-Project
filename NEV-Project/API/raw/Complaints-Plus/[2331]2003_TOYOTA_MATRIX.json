LOUD RATTLING NOISE BEGAN 6 MONTHS AGO EVEN THOUGH THE TRANSMISSION AND THE ENTIRE VEHICLE HAS BEEN MAINTAINED FLAWLESSLY.  TWO WEEKS AGO, ON MARCH 9, 2009 MY BOYFRIEND WAS DRIVING ON THE 15 FREEWAY GOING NORTH WHEN THE CAR BEGAN TO MAKE A HORRIBLE RATTLING NOISE.  MY BOYFRIEND PULLED THE CAR OVER TO SAFETY OFF THE FREEWAY AND TOOK A LOOK.  HE KNEW IT WAS THE TRANNY, HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEE ANYTHING...THE FIRST CLUE WAS THAT IT WOULD NOT GO INTO 1ST OR REVERSE GEAR AT ALL.  WE HAD TO GET IT TO A PLACE THAT WE COULD PARK IT LEGALLY, SO HE STARTED IT IN SECOND GEAR AND THE CAR WAILED AND WHINED AND SOUNDED LIKE METAL WAS BREAKING APART AS THE CAR LITERALLY LIMPED IT'S WAY THE ENTIRE SHORT RIDE.  WARRANTY GOOD FOR 100,000 MILES, BUT MY CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY AT 105,000 MILES.  TOYOTA WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT THE ENTIRE 2003 MATRIX LINE IS EXPERIENCING THIS ISSUE, AND WILL NOT EVEN DO ANYTHING AS A GOODWILL GESTURE.  A BRAND NEW TRANNY FROM TOYOTA IS $4000+/-, AND THE PROBLEM WILL MOST CERTAINLY HAPPEN AGAIN - AS I HAVE SEEN MANY, MANY PEOPLE ATTEST TO.  A REBUILT TRANSMISSION IS LESS $...TOYOTA NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS.  MY CAR COULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT DUE TO THIS FAILURE ON THE FREEWAY, TO SAY NOTHING OF THE FACT THAT IT'S VERY SCARY AND UNSAFE TO LEAVE YOUR VEHICLE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, AS WELL AS BREAKING DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. *TR",

THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, IT WAS OVER A QUART LOW ON OIL.  THIS HAPPENED AGAIN WHICH TOYOTA HAS A LETTER FROM ME.  AFTER THIS, I DROVE THE CAR 50 MILES AND IT USED AROUND 2/3 A QUART OF OIL.  I CALLED THE TOYOTA EXPERIENCE CENTER AND TOLD THEM THE PROBLEMS I WAS HAVING AND THEY TOLD ME TO TAKE IT TO THE LOCAL DEALER TO HAVE IT CHECKED.  THE PERSON I TALKED TO, LOOKED UP THE VIN # AND TOLD ME THAT THE ENGINE ON THIS CAR HAD BEEN REBUILT AT 41,459 MILES, IN NOVEMBER 2007 AT HEADQUARTERS TOYOTA, IN MIAMI, FLORIDA.  HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT TOYOTA WOULD PROBABLY PICK UP THE REPAIR SINCE IT HAD LESS THAN 4,000 MILES ON A REBUILT ENGINE (CURRENTLY THE CAR HAS 45,398 MILE ON IT).  I TOOK THE CAR TO MY LOCAL DEALER L&S TOYOTA, IN BECKLEY, WV ON DECEMBER 23, 2008.  THEY DID A COMPRESSION TEST ON THE ENGINE AND IT FAILED.  THE SERVICE MANAGER AT L&S TOYOTA TOLD ME THE ENGINE BLOCK SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED WHEN HEADQUARTERS TOYOTA REBUILT THE ENGINE, BUT HADN'T BEEN.  AFTER ABOUT 10 CALLS TO TOYOTA CORPORATE AND NUMEROUS CASE NUMBERS THE VERDICT WAS IN.  TERR, THE SERVICE MANAGER AT L&S TOYOTA SAID THEY WILL NOT FIX THE ENGINE UNLESS I PAY FOR THE REPAIR MYSELF.  JOHN LINO FROM HEADQUARTERS TOYOTA, MIAMI TOLD ME THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF THE REPAIR BUT I WOULD HAVE TO BRING THE CAR THERE, WHICH IS 950 MILES AWAY. THE MATRIX ENGINE HAS BLOWN TWICE WITHIN 45,398 MILES AND TOYOTA IS OFFERING NO ASSISTANCE. BOTH OF THESE DEALERSHIPS ARE GOVERNED BY TOYOTA MOTOR SALES, USA, SO HOW CAN THE ONE GET AUTHORIZATION TO DO THE REPAIR BUT THE OTHER ONE CAN?T?

BUT AFTER THAT, THE DESIGN IS SUCH THAT THE LAP BELT JUST KEPT GETTING TIGHTER AND TIGHTER THE MORE HE TRIED TO GET FREE.  UNFASTENING THE BELT DID NO GOOD.  AND IT SEEMS QUITE DANGEROUS FOR THERE TO BE NO WAY TO RELEASE IT.  THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF MANUAL OVERRIDE MECHANISM FOR SUCH CASES.  OR AT THE VERY LEAST A WARNING IN THE CAR'S MANUAL THAT EXPLAINS THAT IF A PASSENGER ALLOWS THE SHOULDER STRAP TIGHTEN BEHIND THE BODY, THERE WILL BE NO WAY TO LOOSEN THE LAP BELT.  THE TOYOTA DEALER DID REPLACE THE BELTS AT NO COST.  THEY SAID THEY WERE AWARE OF THIS HAPPENING BEOFRE, AND THAT THEY'D MENTION THE PROBLEM TO THEIR DESIGN/SAFETY DEPARTMENT.

TOYOTA SAY THIS IS NORMAL AND THE MANUEL SAYS TO USE THE E-BRAKE. I DO OF COURSE USE THE E-BRAKE IF IT IS STEEPLY PARKED. BUT SINCE E-BRAKES FREEZE IN COLD CONDITIONS, I HAVE A REAL SAFETY CONCERN HERE. I HAVE PARKED MANY OTHER STANDARD CARS IN THE SAME LOCATIONS THE MATRIX ROLLS AWAY IN AND THEY DON'T MOVE. AT MY DEALER THE MAINTENANCE MANAGER AGREED IT WAS A PROBLEM ON THE TEST DRIVE, AS DID HIS TECHNICIAN UNTIL IT WAS FOUND ALL TOYOTA MATRIX DID THE SAME THING. NOW TOYOTA CANADA IS INVOLVED AND ALL SAY THERE ISN'T A PROBLEM NOW. TOYOTA NEED TO WARN PEOPLE PRIOR TO A TEST DRIVE WHEN SOMETHING AS BASIC AS PARKING IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER STANDARDS.",
