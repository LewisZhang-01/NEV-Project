WHEN IT RAINS AND THE DRIVER GOES THROUGH WATER, THE VEHICLES SHUT THEMSELVES DOWN COMPLETELY. LIGHTS TURN OFF, POWER STEERING IS ARRESTED, AND THE DRIVER HAS TO COAST TO A STOP. THIS HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES TO MY PARENTS, AND MORE THAN ONCE, THEY HAVE HAD TO SECURE THE SERVICES OF A TOWING COMPANY TO GET THE VEHICLE(S) HOME OR TO A REPAIR SHOP. THIS HAS HAPPENED AT NIGHT ON TWO-LANE HIGHWAYS, LEAVING THEM STRANDED IN PITCH-BLACK DARKNESS. THESE ARE THE ONLY VEHICLES THAT MY PARENTS HAVE TO DRIVE TO AND FROM WORK, WHICH IS AN HOUR AND A HALF AWAY FROM HOME.     MY FATHER HAS VISITED THE CHRYSLER-DODGE DEALERSHIP SEVERAL TIMES, AND THEY TOLD HIM THAT THIS IS A LARGE-SCALE PROBLEM WITH THESE PARTICULAR MODELS OF VANS. THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF THE ISSUE, BUT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A FULL-SCALE RECALL ON THE VEHICLES. THERE IS A KIT TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THE KIT IS OVER $300, AND THE ONUS IS ON THE CONSUMER TO PURCHASE THE KIT AND HAVE IT INSTALLED. MY DAD SPENT OVER $700 TO HAVE THE KIT INSTALLED ON BOTH VANS.     THIS MANUFACTURER DEFECT IS DANGEROUS NOT ONLY TO THE DRIVERS OF THE VEHICLES, BUT TO OTHER MOTORISTS. PLEASE CONSIDER DOING A NATIONAL RECALL FOR THIS FACTORY DEFECT.",

THE SECOND PROBLEM, A DEFECTIVE CONSTANT VELOCITY JOINT, WAS THE SUBJECT OF AN ARTICLE IN A LOCAL NEWSPAPER ON MARCH 25, 2001.  A COPY OF THIS ARTICLE CAN BE PROVIDED IF DESIRED.  I DON'T BELIEVE THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN PUBLICIZED NATIONALLY.  THE DEFECTIVE CONSTANT VELOCITY JOINTS CAN BE FOUND IN AT LEAST 1991 THROUGH 2000 CHRYSLER/DODGE/PLYMOUTH MINIVANS (AND PERHAPS OTHER MODELS).  THE CONDITION IS OFTEN MISDIAGNOSED AS A BAD RIM OR TIRE.  THE ARTICLE REFERRED TO IN THE CONCORD MONITOR PROVIDES A TERSE, ARTICULATE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM.  AS THE CONSTANT VELOCITY JOINT DETERIORATES THE PROBLEM MANIFESTS ITSELF AS A HIGH SPEED VIBRATION AND EVENTUALLY A BIZARRE WOBBLE WHEREIN THE VEHICLE ROCKS VIOLENTLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE.  THE PROBLEM WAS SO BAD IN OUR 1999 PLYMOUTH GRAND VOYAGER THAT DAIMLERCHRYSLER BOUGHT BACK (EXCHANGED IT FOR A 2000 MINIVAN) THE VEHICLE WITHOUT ADMITTING THE PROBLEM EXISTED.  THE 2000 MODEL YEAR WE WERE GIVEN IN EXCHANGE FOR THE 1999 MODEL HAS THE EARLY SYMPTOMS OF THE FAILING CONSTANT VELOCITY JOINT.
