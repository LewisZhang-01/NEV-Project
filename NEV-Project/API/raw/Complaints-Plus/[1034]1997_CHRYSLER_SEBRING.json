WE GOT OUT, SAW FRONT WHEEL  TURNED OUT AT  SHARP ANGLE, THE RIGHT FRONT OF CAR DROPPED. SHERIDAN POLICE DROVE BY,WE MADE AN ACCIDENT REPORT. AFTER HAVING THE CAR TOWED 2 BLOCKS, THE INS. CO. WAS CALLED WE CONTACTED PHIL LONG CHRYSLER IN LITTLETON CO. TO FIND PRICE ON THE PART. THEY ASKED FOR VIN NUMBER AND DETERMINED THERE WAS RECALL ON THAT VEHICLE. THEY SAID CAR WAS FIXED ONCE UNDER RECALL, THEY WANTED TO SEE IT. WE HAD IT TOWED THERE. BERNIE SAID THEY WOULD AT LEAST FIX THE BALL JOINT. THEY ESTIMATED THE DAMAGE AND CALLED DISTRICT REP TO COME SEE THE CAR. WE WERE CALLED AND TOLD DISTRICT REP SAID NO, THEY WOULD NOT FIX THE CAR UNDER THE RECALL. WE ALSO OWED THEM $100 (DIAGNOSTICS).WE WERE TOLD BY  SERVICE MANAGER, SCOTT VANSICKLE, THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. THE CAR WAS 10 YEARS OLD, HAD 160,000 MILES. [RECALLED PART WAS FIXED AT 20,000 MILES IN 1998.]  DECISION WAS MADE BY THE DISTRICT REP. AND, BESIDES, THOSE PARTS WEAR OUT. I ASKED FOR NAME AND NUMBER OF DISTRICT REP - CHRIS G. AT 1-800-992-1997. I CALLED, WAS TOLD BY ALEX, AFTER MUCH REFERRAL WITH HIS SUPERVISOR, THAT CAR HAD ALREADY BEEN FIXED AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. I TOLD HIM I WANTED TO SPEAK WITH DISTRICT REP, CHRIS G, HE SAID HE WAS NOT AT THAT NUMBER, THEY DIDN'T HAVE A DISTRICT REP THERE, I NEEDED TO GO THROUGH DEALER FOR THAT. I ASKED HIM FOR HIS NAME, ALEX, AND SUPERVISOR'S NAME,RYAN.CHRYSLER'S REP, ( CHRIS G.) HAS OFFERED TO DO ABSOLUTELEY NOTHING TO REMEDY THIS PROBLEM AND IS UNWILLLING TO DO ANYTHING. I AM LUCKY I WAS GOING SLOW AND NOONE WAS HURT.THIS ACCIDENT COULD HAVE HAPPENED AT 65 MPH ON THE FREEWAY AND THE 3 OF US COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. I FIND IT APPALLING THAT CHRYSLER CLAIMS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FAULT OF THIS PART.",

DRIVER ACCELERATED OUT OF THE TOLL BOOTH, UP TO ABOUT 40-45 MPH, AND FELT A SURGE IN ACCELERATION. ATTEMPTED TO REDUCE SPEED BY TAKING FOOT FROM THE GAS PEDAL, BUT THERE WAS NO REDUCTION IN SPEED.  APPLIED BRAKE, BUT STILL NO REDUCTION IN SPEED.  PULLED HAND BRAKE, NO REDUCTION.  THE ACCELERATOR SEEMED TO BE STUCK OR HUNG UP.  FINALLY THOUGHT TO SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL, AND AT SOME POINT THE ACCELERATOR FINALLY \"LET GO.\"  WAS ABLE TO EXIT FROM THE TOLLWAY.  ON 635 ACCESS ROAD, ATTEMPTED ACCELERATION AGAIN, AND AGAIN THE ACCELERATOR SEEMED TO \"STICK\" AT ABOUT 15 MPH.  BACKED OFF, AND MADE WAY SLOWLY TO A NISSAN AUTOMOTIVE DEALERSHIP OFF 635 IN NORTH DALLAS.  THERE, A SERVICE REP LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD AND OBSERVED THE ACCELERATOR CABLE WAS BADLY FRAYED.  AS THE CAR WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE FURTHER, CALLED FOR A TOW AND HAD CAR TOWED TO CHRYSLER DEALER IN GRAPEVINE, TX.  THE FAILURE OF THE VEHICLE TO DECELLERATE ON A BUSY AND FAST-MOVING TOLLWAY AT RUSH HOUR COULD HAVE BEEN CATATROPHIC, BUT DUE TO LUCK OR GRACE, THERE WAS NO COLLISION.  HOWEVER, THE DRIVER SUFFERED MENTAL AND PHYSICAL ANGUISH, STRESS, AND FRANK TERROR DURING THE EVENT.  THIS CAR HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO A RECALL ISSUED IN AUGUST 2002, AND HAD BEEN REPAIRED FOR THE DEFECT AT THE DEALER IN GRAPEVINE.  HOWEVER, THE ACCELERATOR CABLE FAILED ANYWAY.  THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION IS THAT THE DEFECT REPAIR WAS ALSO FAULTY, OR THE DEFECT WAS NOT REPAIRED PROPERLY.  OTHER SYSTEMS IN THE VEHICLE WERE MOST LIKELY IMPACTED: BRAKES AND TRANSMISSION.*AK",

IN THOSE COMPLAINTS I HAD MENTIONED CONCERN OF MY BACK WINDOW POSSIBLY FLYING OUT THE BACK OR WORSE YET, FALLING IN ON MY 2 YEAR OLD SON IN HIS CAR SEAT!!!!  ABOUT 3 OR 4 WEEKS LATER, MY HUSBAND WAS GETTING IN THE CAR AFTER WORK AND IN A PARKED POSITION DECIDED TO PUT THE TOP DOWN (SINCE THE AIR CONDITIONER STOPPED WORKING ABOUT A YEAR PRIOR) TO THE CONVERTIBLE, HE THEN HEARD A CRACK AND AS SOON AS LOOKING BACK THE WHOLE WINDOW SHATTERED IN OVER 1000 PIECES ALL IN THE BACKSEAT AND THE HUB TRUCK AREA AND MY SON'S CARSEAT!!!!  MY WORST NIGHTMARE HAD COME TRUE. I HAD NEARLY BRAINSTORMED THAT THE WINDOW WOULD FLY OUT THE BACK OR THAT IT COULD FALL IN!   THANK YOU JESUS, MY SON WAS NOT IN THE CAR!!!!  I HAVE CONTACTED CHRYSLER WICH DID NOTHING BUT CHARTED MY COMPLAINT AND IS PROBABLY SETTING IN THE DATABASE WITH NO ACTION...  THIS REALLY CONCERNS ME... I DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO TURN.  MY INSURANCE SAID THAT I NEEDED TO MEET MY 500 DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE IN ORDER FOR THEM TO TAKE CARE OF THE REST OF THE BILL, WHICH WILL ONLY APPLY TO A BACK WINDOW... NOT A CONVERTIBLE TOP... HELLO, SINCE THE TOP IS STILL UNRAVELING THIS NEW BACK WINDOW THAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT ONLY HAS A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE THE SAME THING HAPPENS AGAIN!    MY GUESS, SINCE THE THREADING WAS ALREADY COMING LOOSE IT CAUSED THE BACK WINDOW TO GO OFF TRACK UNKNOWINGLY... THEN WHEN MY HUSBAND PUT THE TOP DOWN IT WAS NOT POSITIONED CORRECTLY CAUSING THE WINDOW TO BE IN THE WAY OF THE CONVERTIBLE TOP RECLINING.
