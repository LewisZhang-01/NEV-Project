There was extended product warranty coverage that ended in 2019 on the defect.  I was not notified about this issue. When I contacted Toyota they said I \"may\" have been notified if I brought it to a Toyota dealer for service (which I did not).  The issue is the dashboard starts to melt and gets sticky and causes glare on the windshield during the day when sunlight hits it and at night when vehicle lights are oncoming.  I moved to Florida in late 2019 and noticed the safety issue at that time. If you google the issue (Toyota dashboard recall) it made the news etc.  Toyota was able to make it a product issue and was able to then use the extended warranty rather than calling it a safety issue. The articles on the issue (even from Toyota state it causes glare).  Can this be looked into or at a minimum have the laws changed so these safety concerns can't be listed as a product issue?  I would have thought this would have been a class action lawsuit with the number of issues because of this safety problem. My understanding is safety recalls do not expire and in my opinion (and many others on line that have the same issue) this is a safety issue.    I had contacted the AGs Office in Florida and they suggested I make contact with your office.  Below is some information on the melting dashboards.  In 2014 Toyota offered to replace dashboards in 3.4 million vehicles after owners in sunny states like Arizona and Florida reported that their dashboards were melting, causing a dangerous glare on the windshield. ... Toyota's extended warranty on dashboards expired in 2019.  Thank you for your time.",

ON LAST OIL CHANGE IN JUNE 2019 ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND I TOOK CAR BACK TO THE DEALER THEY DIAGNOSED EXHAUST MANIFOLD NEEDS TO BE REPLACED BUT NEVER DISCLOSED IT IS DUE TO THE TOO MUCH OIL CONSUMPTION. RECENTLY, CAR IS CONSUMING TOO MUCH OIL AND CAR IS JERKING WHEN GAS IS PUSHED. FINALLY, I SEARCHED ONLINE AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE IS AN OIL CONSUMPTION ISSUE WITH 2008 TOYOTA CAMRY. PLEASE WATCH THIS VIDEO ON YOUTUBE HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=ZBQXCQA_PJK I EMAILED TOYOTA COMPANY ABOUT THIS ISSUE THEY NEVER REPLIED IN WRITING. THEY CALLED ME ON PHONE AND SAID SINCE THIS CAR IS OLDER THAN 10 YEARS AND HAS MORE THAN 150,000 MILES, SO THIS ISSUE IS NO MORE COVERED BY TOYOTA. THEY ALSO CLAIM THAT THEY MAILED ME A LETTER IN 2015 WHICH I NEVER RECEIVED., RECEIVED OTHER THREE LETTERS ABOUT OTHER RECALLS FROM TOYOTA AND THESE LETTERS ARE ONLINE IN MY CAR PROFILE, NOT THE ONE ABOUT OIL CONSUMPTION. I ALWAYS TOOK MY CARE TO TOYOTA DEALER FOR OIL CHANGE. I HAVE BEEN TELLING THEM THAT EITHER YOU ALL ARE NOT PUTTING ENOUGH OIL, OR IT IS BURNING TOO MUCH OIL, BUT THEY NEVER DISCLOSED OIL CONSUMPTION ISSUE WITH  MY CAR MODEL. I REQUEST NTSHA TO PLEASE INVESTIGATE WHY   1.TOYOTA NEVER SEND ME A LETTER VIA MAIL REGARDING THIS OIL CONSUMPTION?  2.WHY THIS LETTER IS NOT SHOWING IN THE CAR PROFILE ONLINE BUT ALL OTHERS ARE.  3.WHY DEALER NEVER DISCLOSED ME REGARDING THIS ISSUE, EVEN CAR IS CONSUMING TOO MUCH OIL?  TOYOTA IS A BIG COMPANY AND SHOULD NOT GET BY FROM THEIR RESPONSIBILITY OF CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT EASILY ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ADMITTED THERE IS A DEFECT WITH THESE CARS. I REQUEST NTSHA PLEASE HAVE TOYOTA COMPANY  FIX MY CAR.    THANKS FOR YOUR HELP!",

THE CAR BECAME DIFFICULT TO STEER, BUT WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE PARKING JOB AS THE CAR WAS ALMOST IN PARKING POSITION.  CALLED AAA AND TOWED THE CAR HOME (2PM, NO DEALER WAS OPEN) AND LATER DROVE TO A NEARBY DEALER (THE AAA DRIVER TOLD ME HOW TO HANDLE THE STEERING).  THE INITIAL DIAGNOSTIC BY THE DEALER (STEVENS CREEK TOYOTA, SAN JOSE, CA) IS AN ECU FAILURE.   DEALER TOLD ME THAT WE WERE LUCK AS IT IS VERY HARD TO CONTROL THE CAR WITH THIS PROBLEM.        I WAS LUCKY THAT IT HAPPENED WHILE WE WERE PARKING THE CAR.  IF IT HAPPENED ON HIGHWAY, IT CAN POTENTIALLY CAUSE CRASH FOR SURE.    CAR IS 2008 CAMRY HYBRID, 105K MILE.  WELL MAINTAINED, ALL MAINTENANCE WORK WERE DONE BY TOYOTA DEALER.     WHAT MADE ME EXTREMELY CONCERNED IS THAT THIS CAR HAS A HISTORY OF CRITICAL  SAFETY FUNCTION FAILURE IN THE PAST.  1) DRIVER SIDE WINDER SWITCH WAS OVERHEATED AND GENERATED A LOT OF SMOKES.  DEALER SAID THE SWITCH HAS A DEFECT, AND I BELIEVE IT LED TO A RECALL LATER.   2) DRIVER SIDE WINDOW WIPER STOPPED MOVING WHILE DRIVING IN RAIN, LOST VISIBILITY IN SECONDS.  DEALER SAID A DEFECT IN THE MOTOR CAUSE THE PROBLEM, BUT NOT SURE WHETHER IT LED TO A RECALL.   3) PS / ECU PROBLEM THAT MADE THE CAR HARD TO CONTROL.   I THINK TOYOTA IS DOING EXTREMELY POOR ON THEIR CAR'S SAFETY.    THE DEALER REPORT IS NOT DONE YET.

I STOPPED TO HAVE MY OIL CHECKED AND FOUND OUT THAT I HAD ALMOST NO OIL IN MY ENGINE. PUT THE OIL IN AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN. I BEGAN TO RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT TOYOTA KNOWINGLY SOLD THE VEHICLES WITH THE PISTON DEFECT. I CALLED TOYOTA AND THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD NOT HONOR THE REPAIR DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS OVER THE 10 YEAR ANNIVERSARY DATE. THE MILEAGE WAS UNDER 150,000 (112,000) AND I WAS 2 MONTHS PAST THE DATE AND THEY WILL NOT HONOR THE REPAIRS TO MY VEHICLE. I HAVE ATTACHED THE OIL CONSUMPTION TEST INVOICE DONE BY A TOYOTA DEALER AND THE LETTER SENT TO TOYOTA. I CAN NOT AFFORD TO SPEND $3000 TO $5000 TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. THE CAR HAS ALSO LOST VALUE AND I COULD FIND MYSELF IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION IF THE ENGINE FAILS.  I NEED TO KNOW MY OPTIONS. TOYOTA SHOULD FIX MY CAR AT NO CHARGE TO ME.",

I WAS VERY ANGRY WHEN I SAW IT DIDN'T REGISTER ON THE DIPSTICK AND I HAD TO ADD ABOUT 1 1/4 QUARTS OF OIL. I THOUGHT JIFFY LUBE SHORTED HIM ON OIL AND I THEN STARTED CHANGING IT MYSELF. I KEEP A CLOSE WATCH ON THE OIL CONSUMPTION AND HAVE FOUND THAT I NEED TO ADD ABOUT ONE QUART EVERY 1200 MILES. THE ENGINE IS THE 2AZ-FE, 2.4L AND IS INVOLVED WITH THE OIL CONSUMPTION PROBLEM THAT TOYOTA HAS ACKNOWLEDGED, BUT WILL NOT SEEM TO HELP SINCE THE CAR HAS OVER 150,000 MILES ON IT. AS A CONSUMER I THINK THIS IS WRONG ON TOYOTA'S PART AND THAT THEY SHOULD STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT WHEN IT IS THEIR FAULT FOR KNOWINGLY USING FAULTY PARTS/ MATERIAL, THEN LEAVING THE CONSUMER TO ABSORB THE COST.

THERE WAS HOWEVER A RECALL ON THIS PART, & AFTER MANY ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT A LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP TO ORDER THE PART & SCHEDULE TO GET THIS FIXED BY THE TIME ALLOTMENT THEY HAD PLACED.

YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT HOW USEFUL A SUN VISOR TRULY IS, UNTIL YOU ARE NO LONGER ABLE TO USE IT. IT'S INSTALLED FOR A REASON, NOT TO BE SOMETHING FANCY IN A CAR. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES, THE SUN HAS PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN ALMOST CAUSING AN ACCIDENT DUE TO FAILURE TO SEE ONCOMING TRAFFIC, TRAFFIC LIGHTS, ETC. CLEARLY, TOYOTA RECALLED THIS DUE TO THE MANY FAILURES IT HAD ALREADY RECEIVED. IF, I WAS AWARE THAT THE $500-$600 PART WAS GOING TO BREAK A MONTH AFTER IT'S RECALL DATE. I MOST LIKELY WOULD OF TRIED TO GET IT REPLACED SOMEHOW? OF, COURSE THEY WON'T FIX IT UNTIL IT'S BROKEN. IT'S GOING TO BE AWFULLY HARD TO GET A FAIR MARKET VALUE WHEN TRYING TO EVENTUALLY TRADE IN THE CAR OR SELL IT OUTRIGHT. WHEN, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE CAR. AND, NOBODY IS GOING TO PAY $500-$600 TO FIX THIS. SO, FOR MAJOR SAFETY ISSUES TO TRY & STOP A WRECK OR FATALITY FROM OCCURRING PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

I CALLED THE SERVICE ADVISOR AT MOSS BROS WHO HELPED ME TWO WEEKS PRIOR. I EXPLAINED THE SITUATION AND TOLD HIM I HAD AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST 2 YEARS AGO AND WAS ADVISED EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL. UNFORTUNATELY, HE SAID THERE WAS NOTHING TOYOTA COULD DO TO HELP BECAUSE OF THE HIGH MILEAGE ON MY CAMRY. HE SAID IT WOULD COST $5,000 TO REPLACE THE PISTON RINGS OR $4000 TO REPLACE THE ENGINE.

WHEN WE RECEIVED A WARRANTY ENHANCEMENT NOTIFICATION THAT OUR CAR WAS COVERED FOR EXCESSIVE ENGINE OIL CONSUMPTION, WE STARTED WATCHING OUR OIL CONSUMPTION CLOSELY. WE WERE DEFINITELY GOING THROUGH A QUART OF OIL EVERY 1,000 MILES. WE TOOK THE CAR IN TO A LOCAL DEALERSHIP FOR THE OIL CONSUMPTION TEST IN MARCH 2016 AND WERE TOLD OUR CAR DIDN'T CONSUME ENOUGH OIL TO QUALIFY FOR THE REPAIR. WE KEPT AN EYE ON THE OIL CONSUMPTION AND TOOK IT BACK FOR ANOTHER TEST IN OCTOBER 2016--CONVINCED IT WOULD QUALIFY. THE DEALERSHIP CLAIMED THAT THE CAR AGAIN DID NOT QUALIFY. WE WERE FRUSTRATED BUT HAD LITTLE RECOURSE ON 10/24/16 WITH THE WARRANTY EXPIRING ON 10/31/16.    OUR CAR IS NOW GOING THROUGH A QUART OF OIL EVERY 400-500 MILES. NO KIDDING. WE RESET THE TRIP ODOMETER EACH TIME WE ADD OIL AND ARE FAITHFUL ABOUT CHECKING IT ONCE IT GETS IN THAT 400-500 MILE RANGE.     AT OUR MECHANIC'S SUGGESTION (HE ONLY WORKS ON TOYOTA'S BUT ISN'T AT A DEALERSHIP), WE CALLED TOYOTA HEADQUARTERS EARLIER THIS YEAR. (OUR MECHANIC HAS HIS OWN REASONS FOR NOT BEING IMPRESSED WITH THE DEALERSHIP WE HAD TAKEN OUR CAR TO FOR THE OIL CONSUMPTION TESTING.) MY HUSBAND WAS PUT ON HOLD FOR OVER AN HOUR AND THEN WAS DISCONNECTED. WE HAVEN'T TRIED PHONING TOYOTA AGAIN. WE HAVE BEEN FAITHFUL TOYOTA FANS AND OWNERS FOR DECADES BUT, AS A RESULT OF TOYOTA'S POOR HANDLING OF THIS PROBLEM, WE WILL LIKELY NOT BUY ANOTHER TOYOTA.    IS THIS A SAFETY CONCERN? ABSOLUTELY! IT'S ALSO AN BUSINESS ETHICS CONCERN. WILL OUR OIL CONSUMPTION CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS RAPIDLY AS IT HAS IN THESE LAST 7-8 MONTHS. I HOPE NOT. WE'RE ALREADY ADDING A QUART OF OIL NEARLY EVERY WEEK.

ALERT TONE  & WHIR CONTINUED, ALONG WITH A BURNING KIND OF SMELL FROM THE AREA OF THE FRONT TIRES (RIGHT FRONT TIRE WELL FELT WARM).  IT WAS DARK, SO I DIDN'T NOTICE IF THERE WAS SMOKE OF ANY COLOR.  BECAUSE I WORRIED THAT THE WHIRRING MOTOR WAS GOING TO BURN UP & POSSIBLY EXACERBATE MATTERS, I DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY & HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A DEALER.  I HAVE SOME VIDEOS IF THEY ARE HELPFUL.",

IT IS VERY STICKY TO THE TOUCH, ANTS WILLS WILL STICK TO THE DASHBOARD AND IT IS EASILY GOUGED. I HAVE TRIED TO CLEAN BUT IT DID NOT IMPROVE THE SITUATION. THIS IS AN EXTREME SAFETY HAZARD DUE TO THE GLARE DURING THE DAY SIGNIFICANTLY LIMITING VISIBILITY. MY FAMILY MEMBERS WHO MAY DRIVE THE CAR IMMEDIATELY NOTICE THE PROBLEM WHEN THEY DRIVE MY CAR AND STATE THEY DID NOT FEEL SAFE WITHOUT PUTTING A TOWEL OR SOMETHING ON THE DASHBOARD.  *TR",

BUT, THOSE WHO WERE UNAWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND NEVER INFORMED OF IT BY TOYOTA ARE LEFT IN THE DARK. MY ISSUE IS THAT THE OIL CONSUMPTION NOW AFFECTS THE EMISSIONS SYSTEM. IT IS INCREASING MORE DIFFICULT TO RAPIDLY ACCELERATE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THIS OIL CONSUMPTION HAS NOW RUINED MY CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND THUS MAKING ACCELERATION AT THE PROPER RATE IMPOSSIBLE. I WENT TO ACCELERATE AND MY CAR COULDN'T DO IT PROPERLY, NEARLY CAUSING AN ACCIDENT. THEN I NOTICED MY MIL WAS ILLUMINATED. I HAD IT CHECKED AND ITS A P0420 CODE. I HAVE HAD THE CAR DIAGNOSTICALLY EXAMINED AND NOW THE CAR CANNOT MEET THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD FOR THE CAR'S ECM TO CONDUCT A SELF TEST, THUS ILLUMINATING THE MIL. I HAVE HEARD OF OTHERS RUNNING OUT OF OIL AND SEIZING THEIR ENGINES DURING OPERATION OF THEIR VEHICLES. THIS IS UNSAFE. NHTSA AND TOYOTA ARE BOTH KEENLY AWARE OF THIS ISSUE, BUT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO FIX THE VEHICLES THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE ROAD. I WENT TO MY TOYOTA DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE NEW AND THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE SAID THAT TOYOTA WILL NOT FIX THESE VEHICLES WITHOUT THE CUSTOMER PAYING FOR THE REPAIR. THE INFORMAL QUOTE FOR THE ENGINE ALONE WAS $3500.00 ALONE, NOT INCLUDING THE EMISSIONS ISSUES. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE DISGRACE. I HOPE YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.  *TR",

READINGS WOULD RECOVER AND FAIL CONTINUOUSLY, AND IN OTHER CASES WORKED PROPERLY FOR 30 MILES.  IN SOME CASES, AC STOPPED BLOWING COLD.

THEREFORE EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS AN UNINTENDED ACCELERATION ISSUE TOYOTA WILL DO NOTHING. RECOMMENDATION FROM BOTH CONSUMER REPORTS AND EDMUNDS IS A BRAKE OVERRIDE SHOULD BE INSTALLED.

THEY DIDN'T RETURN PHONE CALLS OR NOTIFY THE DEALER OF ANY RESULTS. DEALER STATED TOYOTA WOULDN'T LET THEM WORK ON THE CAR AND IT WAS LISTED UNSAFE TO DRIVE.

THIS STARTED AFTER THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED ON THE VEHICLE AND MY EXTENDED WARRANTY PURCHASED DOES NOT COVER TRIM FOR THE VEHICLE. I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE INTO TOYOTA FOR ROUTINE SERVICE FOR SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE AND INQUIRED ABOUT THE DASHBOARD. I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT THIS IS A RECURRING PROBLEM FOR THESE VEHICLES AND THEY HAVE ALREADY CHANGED MULTIPLE DASHBOARDS. I WAS TOLD THIS WAS AN EXPENSIVE PROBLEM TO RESOLVE (1100 FOR PART AND 660 FOR LABOR), AND TO CALL TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE TO FILE A COMPLAINT TO SEE IF THEY WOULD HELP RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. AFTER A REVIEW BY TOYOTA THEY SAID THEY WOULD PAY FOR THE PART BUT I WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LABOR. I WAS TOLD THAT DUE TO THIS NOT BEING A RECALL THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO OFFER ANYTHING BY LAW. I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE IT IS CREATING A SHINY \"REFLECTING\" EFFECT ON THE WINDSHIELD THAT IMPAIRS VISIBILITY WHILE DRIVING. THIS IS  A RECURRING PROBLEM AND NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED GIVEN THAT IT IS A HAZARD TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. DUE TO THIS I AM BITING THE BULLET AND WILL PAY TO HAVE THIS REPAIRED. ALTHOUGH, WHAT WORRIES ME ARE THE DRIVERS HAVING THIS PROBLEM AND UNABLE TO AFFORD THE REPAIRS DUE TO TOYOTA NOT HONORING THEIR PRODUCT. PLEASE CONSIDER INVESTIGATING THIS MATTER FURTHER.  *TR",

THE CAR CONTINUED TO GET WORSE AND I TOOK IT BACK TO A TOYOTA DEALER ON 2/14/12.  THEY TOLD ME ALL 4 STRUTS WERE LEAKING PAST THE NORMAL AMOUNT AND SHOULD BE REPLACED.  THEY ALSO SAID THE FRONT AND REAL LINKS AND BUSHINGS SHOULD BE REPLACED BECAUSE THE CAR IS ALL OVER THE ROAD AND THERE IS NOISE FROM THESE COMPONENTS.

THE GENTLEMAN AT FIRESTONE CONFIRMED THAT THE TIRES WERE ABNORMALLY WORN AND MADE A RECOMMENDATION TO HIS BOSS THAT AT LEAST 3 OF 4 TIRES BE REPLACED AT NO COST TO ME. THE NEXT DAY, I RETURNED AND AT FIRST THE MANAGER WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT, BUT AFTER HE HAD INSISTED ON TESTING THE ALIGNMENT AND FINDING THAT IT WAS CLOSE TO PERFECT, HIS TONE CHANGES AND HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN NICER. HE AUTHORIZED THE REPLACEMENT OF ALL TIRES, WHICH HAD TO BE ORDERED, AS TOYOTA ONLY PERMITS SUBSTITUTIONS WITH THE SAME, OR ONE GRADE LOWER SPEED RATING, AND THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT HAVE V-RATED TIRES IN STOCK, BUT THE NEXT DAY I ONCE AGAIN RETURNED AND ONE HOUR LATER DROVE AWAY WITH BRAND NEW TIRES. N.B. IF YOU DO NOT REGULARLY ROTATE, BALANCE, AND IF-NEEDED ALIGN YOUR TIRES, BRIDGESTONE/FIRESTONE WILL NOT REPLACE. *TR",

I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE PEDAL ALL THE WAY, MAYBE  A HALF A FOOT, BUT ALL I HEARD WAS THE ENGINE RACING AS I SAW MYSELF GETTING CLOSER TO THE CAR IN THE LANE IN FRONT OF ME. I PANICKED AND BEGAN TO STOMP DOWN ON THE PEDAL SEVERAL TIMES, I FIGURE I WAS ABOVE EIGHTY MPH BY THEN. AS I WAS TRYING TO DECIDE HOW TO STEER AROUND  EVERYONE I HAMMERED DOWN ON THE PEDAL AGAIN AND IT STOPPED. THE CAR ACCELERATED OK AND I CAREFULLY USED THE GAS UNTIL I GOT THE CAR HOME.   I THEN CALLED THE NEW HOLLAND TOYOTA DEALERSHIP WHO DID THE RECALL FIX ON 3-27-2010, TOLD DOUG WHAT JUST HAPPENED. I NEVER HAD THE CAR DO THIS BEFORE! I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT HAD A GOOD SMOOTH RIDE. DOUG GAVE ME THE 800 NUMBER TO CALL TOYOTA TO FILE FOR A CASE MANAGER. I'M VERY UPSET AND AFRAID TO USE THIS CAR FOR ME OR MY FAMILY. I FEEL LIKE IT'S UNBELIEVABLE THAT IT HAPPENED TO ME BUT IT DID.

I APPLIED THE BRAKES TO SLOW INTO THE PARKING STALL. THE MOMENT THAT I APPLIED THE BRAKES; THE ENGINE STARTED TO RACE; THE CAR LURCHED FORWARD; THE BRAKES WERE USELESS IN STOPPING THE VEHICLE; AND I COULD NOT STEER THE VEHICLE. MY VEHICLE SLAMMED INTO A PARKED JEEP CHEROKE; THE JEEP INTURN COLLIDED WITH A PARKED SUBARU OUTBACK.  MY VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WE ARE WAITING FOR TOYOTA'S TECHNICIANS TO EXAMINE THE CAR. I AM VERY THANKFUL TO GOD THAT NO ONE WAS INJURED OR KILLED IN THIS INCIDENT. HOWEVER, I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT MY CAMRY IS UNSAFE AND I WILL NEVER DRIVE IT AGAIN. I HAVE WRITTEN THE VEHICLE OFF AS A TOTAL LOSS. SINCE I AM A JEHOVA WITNESS, I CANNOT SELL THE VEHICLE BECAUSE THEN  I WOULD BE BLOOD-GUILTY IF ANYONE WAS INJURED OR KILLED BY THE VEHICLE.   I AM A ELECTRICAL ENGINEER WITH A MASTERS DEGREE IN ELECTRONICS AND CONTROL SYSTEMS. I HAVE 32 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN SYSTEMATICALLY SOLVING ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS (PARTICULARLY INTERMITTENT ELECTRICAL ISSUES).   IN MY CASE, GIVEN THE SIMULTANEOUS FAILURE OF MULTIPLE SYSTEMS (ENGINE RPM CONTROL, BRAKING AND STEERING), THE CAUSE IS DEFINITELY ELECTRICAL , NOT MECHANICAL. MY EXPERIENCE WITH COMPUTER CONTROLS STRONGLY SUGGESTS THAT THE KEY HARDWARE INVOLVED IS THE ON-BOARD CPU.

ON FEB. 16,2010, WHILE I WAS DRIVING AT APPROXIMATELY 10 MPH COMING TO A STOP LIGHT,  I PRESSED MY BRAKE PEDAL. THE BRAKE STARTED SHAKING AND MAKING A WEIRD NOISE AS IF GEARS WERE MOVING/GRINDING.  IT WAS UNLIKE THE ANTILOCK BRAKE SRS SYMPTOM.  I IMMEDIATELY PLACED MY CAR ON PARK AND STOPPED THE CAR.  THANK GOD THAT I HAD ENOUGH TIME/SPACE BETWEEN MY CAR AND THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME:  I HAD STARTED STOPPING WELL AHEAD, AS I USUALLY DO.  WHEN I STOPPED THE CAR, THE CAR BEHIND ME STARTED HONKING:  IT WAS RUSH HOUR.  WHEN THE CAR IN FRONT STARTED MOVING, I STARTED MY CAR AGAIN AND  DROVE INTO THE NEAREST PARKING LOT.  I STARTED MY CAR AND DROVE IN CIRCLES IN THE PARKING LOT.  IT RETURN TO NORMAL.    I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR NOW.

I BROUGHT IT INTO THE DEALER AND THEY NOTED THE STRUT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  NOT SOON AFTER THAT REPAIR @ AROUND 80K MILES I EXPERIENCED THE SAME NOISE AND VIBRATION IN THE WHEEL AGAIN AND I TOOK IT TO A LES SCHWAB AUTO SHOP THEY LINKED THE PROBLEM TO THE STRUTS AND WHEEL BEARINGS WHICH CAUSED UNEVEN TIRE WEAR.  AS THE CAR WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AGAIN, THEY AGREED WITH THE ASSESSMENT FROM LES SCHWAB AND REPLACED THE STRUTS AGAIN AND THE WHEEL BEARING.  THE DEALER AGREED THAT I SHOULD NOT BE REPLACING THE STRUTS  AS OFTEN AS I WAS ON A RELATIVELY NEW VEHICLE.  DEALER MENTIONED THAT IT IS A DEFECT AND TOYOTA (THE CORPORATION) IS AWARE OF IT AND THAT I SHOULD BE GETTING A LETTER IN THE MAIL TO THAT EFFECT.  TO DATE ( 2/26/10) I HAVE RECEIVED NO SUCH LETTER.  THE CONCERN IS THAT NHTSA HAS NOT YET GOTTEN TO THE BOTTOM OF ALL THE DEFECTS THAT ARE OUT THERE WITH THE CAMRY MODELS FOR THE YEARS THAT ARE NOW BEING RECALLED FOR ACCELERATOR ISSUES.  WITH THE RECENT RECALL I HAD TO BRING MY CAMRY IN TO GET THE GAS PEDAL SHORTENED AND TO INSTALL THE SHIMMY TO PREVENT THE SUDDEN ACCELERATION.  PLEASE LOOK INTO THE ISSUE WITH THE STRUTS AS THE STRUT HOUSING SERVES AS A STRUCTURAL PART OF THE SUSPENSION SYSTEM AND IT CONNECTS THE UPPER STRUT BEARING TO THE LOWER BALL JOINT SO THAT THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY CAN THEN PIVOT WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL IS TURNED.  STRUTS THEREFORE AFFECTS THE DRIVER'S ABILITY TO STEER AND MANEUVER THE VEHICLE SAFELY, I NOW SEE THAT THE COROLLA ARE BEING RECALLED FOR STEERING ISSUES, I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO ONLY THAT MODEL AS MY CAMRY HAD ISSUES WITH STEERING THAT WAS LINKED TO DEFECTIVE STRUTS.  STRUTS SHOULD NOT WEAR OUT AS OFTEN AS MINE DID ON A NEW CAR.  FOR THE SAFETY OF TOYOTA DRIVERS INVESTIGATE HOW MANY VEHICLES FROM 2007 TO 2010 HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH STRUTS. *TR",

WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT THE CAR, I HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL, PRIMARILY CLIMBING OR DESCENDING HILLS (I COMMUTE ALONG THE TACONIC PARKWAY IN NY).  IF YOU SET THE CAR AT 60MPH, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CAR WOULD SLOW DOWN TO ABOUT 50MPH WHEN IT WAS CLIMBING, THEN SUDDENLY DOWN SHIFT AND ACCELERATE VERY QUICKLY, LITERALLY PINNING YOU BACK IN YOUR SEAT.  THIS WOULD THEN CAUSE THE CAR TO SPEED UP TO ABOUT 75MPH BEFORE COASTING.  BUT IT WOULD NOT SLOW DOWN THE CAR IN ANY WAY UNTIL I EITHER BRAKED OR THE CAR STARTED ASCENDING ANOTHER HILL.    WHEN I HAD A CHANCE, I TOOK THE CAR IN TO THE LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER AND MENTIONED THIS TO HIM.  HE ADMITTED THAT TOYOTA HAD A \"SERVICE BULLITEN\" OUT TO UPDATE THE SOFTWARE AS THERE WERE SOME FLAWS IN THE PROGRAMMING.  WHEN I QUESTIONED WHY IT WASN'T A FLEET WIDE RECALL, HE SAID \"WE ONLY HAVE TO DO IT WHEN PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT IT\".  CONSIDERING THE WILD EXTREMES OF THE SPEEDS THAT I WAS EXPERIENCING I FOUND THIS COMMENT TO BE EXTREMELY ODD.    HOWEVER, AFTER THEY DID THEIR FIX, THE CAR DID IMPROVE AS IT DOESN'T ACCELERATE WILDLY LIKE IT USED TO.  BUT EVEN TODAY AS I WAS DRIVING THE CAR BACK FROM BALTIMORE, IT STILL HAS A WIDE OPEN RANGE FOR IT'S CRUISE CONTROL THAT I THINK IS NOT NORMAL.  I HAD THE CRUISE SET FOR 65MPH TODAY, AND THE CAR TOPPED OUT AT 80.  + OR - 15MPH IS WAY TOO FAR BEYOND AN ACCEPTABLE RANGE.  MY CIVIC CONTROLS THE SPEED WITHIN A +-5MPH RANGE ON THE SAME ROUTE.

THE SENSATION I GET IS, \"THE CAR FEELS LIKE IT IS PULLING FORWARD IN RESISTANCE TO THE BRAKING ACTION CREATING WHAT FEELS LIKE A SLOW BRAKING RESPONSE\".

NOW THAT I AM READING ABOUT TWO (OR THREE) TOYOTA RECALLS, I THINK THERE IS AT LEAST A POSSIBILITY THAT THE SLOW BRAKE RESPONSE MAY BE A DESIGN FLAW.      I WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT 5/13/2009 WHERE I REARENDED ANOTHER CAR ON ROUTE 84 IN FARMINGTON  CT.  WHEN THE TRAFFIC SLOWED, I THOUGHT I HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO STOP.

I CONTINUE TO BE STARTLED BY THE BRAKING ACTION IN THIS CAR AND DEFINITELY WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER CAMRY HYBRID.   THE CAR WAS REPAIRED BY TOYOTA AND IS IN GOOD CONDITION. THE BRAKES CONTINUE TO PRODUCE WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE A SLOW RESPONSE.  MY ONLY OTHER THOUGHT REGARDING THE SLOW BRAKING IS THE POSSIBLE IMPACT OF THE ADDED WEIGHT FROM THE HYBRID SYSTEM AND BATTERIES IN A CAR THAT WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED FOR A GAS ENGINE ONLY.  *TR",

I BELIEVE THIS TO BE RELATED TO NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID 09V388000. I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE \"TOYOTA HAS DETERMINED THAT THIS DEFECT DOES NOT EXIST IN VEHICLES IN WHICH THE DRIVER SIDE FLOOR MAT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE VEHICLE AND IS PROPERLY SECURED\" AND BELIEVE THAT MY COMPLAINT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED CONCURRENTLY WITH THIS ONE.  1.  MY COMPATIBLE AND PROPERLY SECURED CARPETED DRIVER'S SIDE FLOOR MAT SLIPPED OFF THE RETAINING HOOKS (CLIPS) AND BUNCHED UP UNDER THE PEDALS. THERE ARE ONLY TWO HOOKS, WHICH ARE REMOVABLE, AND THEY SPIN AROUND AND AROUND, ALLOWING THE MAT TO SLIP OFF. I BELIEVE THAT A SIMPLE FIX OF INSTALLING PERMANENT HOOKS THAT DO NOT SPIN, OR FOUR HOOKS, WOULD SOLVE THIS POTENTIALLY FATAL ISSUE.  2. AS I WAS DRIVING, I FOUND MYSELF UNABLE TO DEPRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL. I DISCOVERED THAT MY FLOOR MAT HAD LODGED UNDER THE BRAKE PEDAL, MAKING IT SO THAT COULD NOT PRESS IT DOWN. FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO DISLODGE THE MAT AND AVOID A COLLISION. THIS INCIDENT ONLY HAPPENED ONCE, BUT THE MATS DO COME OFF THE HOOKS FREQUENTLY, THEREFORE I MUST CONSTANTLY MAKE SURE THAT MY MAT IS SECURE AND THAT THE HOOKS ARE FACING THE CORRECT WAY SO THE MAT CANNOT SLIP OFF THEM.  3. THE FAILURE WAS NOT REPORTED AND NO ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN. *TR",
