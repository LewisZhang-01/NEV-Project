Was scheduled for service on 12/06/21 at Adams Buick GMC in Richmond, KY and mentioned the problem and previous complaint. Was told that it had been over a year ago but that they could fix it and charge me $152 for part & $315 for labor. It was less that 26000 miles driven since the last issue. After last complaint, the dealer contacted GMC and the part was replaced at no cost under bulletin for concern # 5 145420 and they replaced the transmission control assembly. This is an ongoing problem with GMC and I don't think that every 26000 miles I should have to pay to replace the same part when GMC knows it is a problem by the numerous complaints. In fact while I was getting my vehicle serviced, I spoke to another lady there who had the same problem with her vehicle. Had I not caught the message, I probably would have had to replace my battery or my vehicle could have rolled into the house. There were no warning lamps or messages prior. GMC needs to step up to the plate and issue a recall because they have numerous vehicles with the same problem. My vehicle has undergone this malfunction twice and I find it unacceptable and know that I can't afford to pay $467 every 26000 miles for an issue that GMC is clearly aware of but won't address because no one has been killed by the issue as of this date to my knowledge, but it's going to happen sooner or later if the issue is not addressed properly.",

        "summary": "Vehicle was purchased used in June 2020  ISSUE #1  After shifting car into park, display will indicate P for PARK , but also says vehicle is not in park. Since you are not sure if it actually in PARK and to eliminate this display, you need to restart the vehicle, go thru the gears again and then back into PARK.  This happens several times a week with having to restart and PARK again up to 10 TIMES before the vehicle will register it is in park.  I have read there is a Technical Service Bulletin on this issue as well as a case to get GMC to issue a RECALL.  This is a serious issue because you are unaware if the vehicle transmission is actually in PARK.  Having to restart and continually shift to park is time consuming and quite frankly a nuisance.   At this point in time, the only way of correction, other than RESTARTING UP TO TEN TIMES, is to click the gear shift several times after placing in park.  This will work 5/10 times.  ISSUE #2 - Vehicle does not always detect remote.  Have replaced battery  in remote 5 times and will last approximately 8-10 weeks.  At times, when the vehicle has been driven and is placed into park, the display will read NO REMOTE DETECTED.  Have also placed remote into pocket into console and will still receive the same NO REMOTE DETECTED. Although there is never any indication battery is low or dead on remote, this is also the only possible correction we have found.  However, we do believe there must be another correction for this issue.",

The first incident was in April 2019, and it was repaired under warranty at about 24,800 miles.  The second incident was this past week at about 50,800 miles, and this repair cost almost $800 to fix.  I contacted GM customer support and was told that I could not get any reimbursement because there was no special coverage or recall for this known problem.  This is completely unacceptable, since the problem is clearly a defect in parts manufacturing or assembly, and it renders the vehicle completely unusable since it is impossible to turn the car off when the car does not recognize that the shifter is in park.  This is a safety issue because the driver needs to be certain whether or not the vehicle is securely parked before leaving the vehicle.",

My dealership tells me they have a lot of customers with the same problem which usually starts when the vehicle has around 15K miles on the odometer. The problem is the Intermittent Shift to Park display on the Information Center. It tells me that the shifter is not in park position when I go to turn the engine off,  but it really is in position. When it happens I cannot turn off the automobile without restarting it. Sometimes it will turn itself off after a few seconds without any intervention on my part, sometimes more, sometimes after I jiggle the shift lever, but many times I have to restart the engine one or more times to turn the vehicle off.   If the system can't be sure if I'm truly in Park position, how can it be sure that the lever is really engaged which would enable the car to roll away.   I have had it back for repair service twice during the bumper to bumper warranty period to resolve the issue based on GMC guidance. That service tends to resolve it for a while but it always comes back again after a period of time. The last time I was told a jumper was installed so I should never get the problem again but it has returned and have had quite a few occurrences over the past two months.  There is absolutely no pattern to the problem.  What is really frustrating me is that I recently took it back again (after my bumper to bumper warranty was over) and they tell me there is another service bulletin from GMC which says the original shifter cable is too short and they need to install a longer one. Now they want me to pay $375 to install the new cable which is WRONG WRONG WRONG in order to resolve a GMC safety issue which was the result of an original design issue by GMC. I refused as this must be covered by GMC and should be the subject of a government mandated safety recall.",

I WAS TOLD THIS IS A PROBLEM SEEN A LOT WITH 2017 ACADIAS.  SERVICE DEPARTMENT TOLD ME THAT MICHELIN WOULD PAY TO REPLACE ALL 4 TIRES BUT WOULD SPLIT THE COST WITH ME, MEANING I HAVE TO PAY 500-600 DOLLARS FOR NEW TIRES WHEN GMC AND MICHELIN KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE.  THESE ARE 60000 MILE TIRES AND SHOULD NOT BE WORN THIS BADLY AT 34400 MILES.  I LEASE THIS CAR AND HAVE A YEAR LEFT.  I DO NOT FEEL I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING TO REPLACE DEFECTIVE TIRES.  I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT MICHELIN'S OFFER TO SPLIT COST IS ONLY GOOD UNTIL 36000 MILES WHICH DOESN'T GIVE ME MUCH TIME TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO OR PURSUE A MORE SATISFACTORY RESOLUTION. IF I DON'T REPLACE THE TIRES IN THE NEXT MONTH OR SO, I WILL HAVE TO PAY FULL COST TO REPLACE THEM LATER.  IF I TURN THE CAR IN EARLY, I HAVE 13 PAYMENTS LEFT TO ROLL INTO A NEW LEASE WHICH INCREASES MY MONTHLY PAYMENT SIGNIFICANTLY.  MICHELIN AND/OR GM NEED TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND PUT ALL NEW TIRES ON AT NO COST TO ME.",
