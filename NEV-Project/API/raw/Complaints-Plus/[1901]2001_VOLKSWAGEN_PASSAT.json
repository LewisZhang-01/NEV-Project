Sometime within 24 hours before the airbag deployed, the airbag fault light turned on in the car's dashboard display.  Within 15 minutes before the incident, the car's automatic locking locks unlocked twice while I was driving the car.  After the second time, I tried to lock the car doors by pressing the lock button on the driver's door console but the doors would not locked.  At that time I noticed that the two interior lights in the back seat area were turned on.  All the doors of the car were properly shut. When the airbags deployed I was driving on the smooth 1 year old concrete section of Hwy 494.  I did not hit anything on the highway.  After the deployment, I parked on the shoulder, shut off the engine and opened the passenger door to air out the car.  After about 5 minutes, I got back in the car and drove home.  The automatic locks worked again.  The interior lights automatically turned off. The drive home was uneventful.",

FORTUNATELY SHE WAS IN A RURAL AREA AND WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR SHUT OFF IMMEDIATELY AND COASTED OFF THE ROAD WITHOUT INCIDENT.  2.  THE FAILURE WAS THE RESULT OF SEVERE OIL COKING WITH THE 1.8T ENGINE.  VW ISSUED A NOTIFICATION LETTER DATED AUGUST 2004 ADVISING OF THE ?OIL SLUDGE? PROBLEM.  THE LETTER STATES ?ENGINE OIL SLUDGE OCCURS WHEN OLD, DIRTY ENGINE OIL THICKENS AND CANNOT CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE ENGINE LUBRICATION.?   THE LETTER IMPLIES THE ISSUE IS DUE TO POOR MAINTENANCE.  IN REALITY THE FAILURE IS DUE TO A LATENT DESIGN DEFECT OF IMPROPER HEAT REJECTION ATTRIBUTE OF THE ENGINE SUMP.  BASICALLY NOT ENOUGH OIL QUANTITY AND OIL COOLING CAPACITY.  THE OIL THEN COKES OVER TIME IN A SIMILAR MANNER AS IS ENCOUNTERED ON GAS TURBINE ENGINES UNDER EXTREME TEMPERATURES.  EVENTUALLY THE COKED PARTICLES ACCUMULATE AND PLUGS THE SUMP SCREEN.  THE OIL PUMP THEN  RESULTING IN THE LOSS OF OIL PRESSURE AND ENGINE FAILURE.  THE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER AT A CRITICAL TIME IS A SAFETY CONCERN.   3.  FORTUNATELY AS OUR CAR WAS NOT RUN WITHOUT OIL PRESSURE I WAS ABLE TO SAVE THE ENGINE.  VW WOULD NOT HONOR THE WARRANTY DESPITE PROVIDING A LOG BOOK FROM ALL THE MAINTENANCE PERFORMED FROM NEW.  THEY REQUIRED ALL RECEIPTS OF OIL CHANGES.  I PERFORM ALL MY OWN MAINTENANCE.   VW CLEARLY HAS GAMED THE WARRANTY AND MISREPRESENTED THE PROBLEM AS POOR MAINTENANCE AND SLUDGE.  I HAVE ALWAYS CHANGED THE OIL EVERY 5K MILES.  THIS COST ME NEARLY $2K IN PARTS NOT INCLUDING MY LABOR.  THIS IS A MAJOR REPAIR.  THE OIL PUMP, SUMP SCREEN, ALL CRANK CASE VENTILATION LINES, TURBO LINES, ETC. HAD TO BE REPLACED.  THERE WAS COFFEE GROUNDS (COKED OIL) THROUGHOUT THE ENGINE.  WHAT A MESS.  I HOLD A BS IN AERO ENGR TECH AND FAA A&P LICENSE.  I RUN THE AFTERMARKET FOR A LARGE GAS TURBINE ENGINE MFG.

WHEN I TOOK TO THE DEALER HE WAS SAYING ITS GOING TO INCUR A HUGE COST AS IT IS AIRBAG AND THE ENTIRE DASH BOARD NEEDS TO BE REMOVED TO GET THIS THING FIXED.   I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT  THIS AND NEEDED HELP IN THIS ASPECT. I HAVE ALL THE CLAIM NUMBERS AND ALSO THE REQUIRED INFORMATION IN THIS ASPECT. I DON'T THINK MY CAR IS SAFE ENOUGH TO DRIVE AS THE AIRBAG CAN DEFLATE ANY TINE.  PLEASE GUIDE ME IN THIS ASPECT. *TR",

VW WILL NOT COVER MY REPAIRS SIMPLY BECAUSE I DID NOT KEEP EVERY SINGLE PURCHASE RECEIPT FOR MY OIL CHANGES. THEY CLAIM, WITHOUT RECEIPTS THERE IS NO WAY OF KNOWING THAT I PUT IN APPROPRIATE OIL. MY RESPONSE IS, YOU SPEND $30,000 FOR A VEHICLE, I HAVE PROVEN I CHANGED OIL EVERY 3,000, WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD I PUT IN AN OIL THAT DID NOT CONFORM TO MY OWNERS MANUAL.    THIS IS THE LAST VW MY FAMILY WILL PURCHASE.  *TR",

NOT TO MENTION THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASE IN 2001 WITH 6 MILES AND HAS ONLY GOT 53000 NOW IN 2006. I HAVE GOTTEN THE ROUTINE OIL CHANGES UP TO DATE AND THEY ARE REQUIRING ME TO SHOW PROOF OF ALL OIL CHANGES. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO KEEPS EVERY OIL CHANGE RECEIPT!!! THIS  IS INSANE. I AM SO FED UP WITH THE WAY VW IS TAKING CARE OF THIS ISSUE, THEY ARE USING THIS AS AN EXCUSE SO THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO REPAIR MY VEHICLE. I AM STILL IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIND ALL THE \"DOCUMENTATION\" THAT IS NEEDED. I CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT LESS THAN 3 WEEKS OF MY LAST OIL CHANGE VW STILL WILL NOT PROVIDE ME WITH MODERATE SERVICE. I WILL NEVER, REPEAT NEVER BUY ANOTHER VEHICLE OR RECOMMEND VW TO ANYONE!! I HAVE READ ALL OTHER SIMILAR COMPLAINTS AND I CAN SEE THAT VW HAS NO REMORSE FOR THE FISHY SERVICE IT IS PROVIDING. I WILL TAKE THIS ACTION FURTHER. I JUST WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE GOT THERE VEHICLES WITH THE \"SLUDGE\" COVERED UNDER WARRANTY??? WHY EVEN PURCHASE THE WARRANTY IF IT IS NOT COVERING THE PROBLEM??? *JB",

THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED, IN DEC 2004, I WAS TOLD THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO AN UNUSUALLY STRONG RAIN STORM AND THE RESULTING WATER DAMAGE EFFECTED THE BREAK SYSTEM. AT THAT TIME THE CAR WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. THIS TIME  IT'S HAPPENING OFF WARRANTY AND I'M BEING TOLD THAT ONE OF THE COMPUTERS HAS TO BE REPLACED AND THERE COULD BE FURTHER DAMAGE WHICH WILL ONLY BE DETECTED AFTER A NEW COMPUTER IS INSTALLED.

THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE VW DEALER TOLD ME THAT CHECKING THE POLLEN FILTER SEAL IS NOT PART OF ANY REGULAR MAINTENANCE AND THAT IN ORDER TO CHECK IT, YOU'D NEED TO DISASSEMBLE QUITE A FEW THINGS IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.

THE VW SERVICE GUY SAID, YES, VOLKSWAGEN HAS IDENTIFIED A MECHANICAL PROBLEM WITH OUR MODEL VEHICLE WHERE THE TURBO  CAN NOT HANDLE CONVENTIONAL MOTOR OIL.

WE HAVE ALWAYS GOTTEN OUR REGULAR OILL CHANGES SO THE RECEIPTS SHOULD BE HANDY. WELL, I DIDN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THE DESTRUCTION OF OUR NEW ORLEANS HOME BY HURRICANE KATRINA.

AS I WAS TRAVELING ON VACATION THE CAR GAVE WARNING OF THIS SITUATION AND THE SYSTEM ADVISED THAT THE CAR BE STOPPED IMMEDIATELY.  I STOPPED THE CAR AND BEGAN PURSUING OPTIONS TO GET THE CAR TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP.  THE DEALERSHIP DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS OIL SLUDGE.  THE REPAIR WAS AS SIMPLE AS CLEANING THE OIL PUMP STRAINER AND OIL PAN.  THE REPAIR COST APPROXIMATELY $500.00.  NOW, SOME 20K MILES LATER MY CAR HAD ANOTHER OIL RELATED ISSUE.  THIS TIME THE OIL COOLER MALFUNCTIONED AND RUPTURED CAUSING $8,000 - $10,000 IN REPAIR COST.  OF COURSE THE CAR IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY AND RECENT ACTIONS BY VOLKSWAGEN TO EXTEND WARRANTIES FOR OIL SLUDGE DO NOT INCLUDE THE OIL COOLER.  THE OIL SLUDGE ISSUE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A MAJOR CONCERN OF VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICAN BY THEIR ACTIONS TOWARD THE WARRANTY EXTENSION, BUT THEY ARE AVOIDING PARTS AND THE MECHANICAL OPERATIONS THAT COULD LEAD TO THE PROBLEM BEING CORRECTED.  OBVIOUSLY OIL THAT IS NOT PROPERLY COOLED WILL BREAK DOWN QUICKER THAN OIL RUNNING AT MORE ACCEPTABLE TEMPERATURES.    CURRENTLY, VOLKSWAGEN CAN MAKE NO CONCLUSIVE ANALYSIS AS TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AN OIL COOLER MALFUNCTION AND OIL SLUDGE.  THIS WOULD BE KEY IN DETERMINING THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CAR REPAIRS.  VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA'S CUSTOMER CARE ADVOCATES HAVE REFERRED ME TO MY DEALERSHIP ON TWO OCCASIONS AND MY DEALERSHIP SEEMS TO BE UNABLE TO MAKE 100% CONCLUSIVE DECISIONS.  I BELIEVE IT IS VOLKSWAGENS RESPONSIBILITY TO GUARANTEE THEIR PRODUCTS.  THEY ARE IN NO POSITION TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITY ESPECIALLY AFTER ALLOWING THE OIL SLUDGE ISSUE TO CONTINUE FROM 1998 MODELS CARS TO CURRENT 2004 MODELS WITHOUT OFFERING CONSUMER ASSISTANCE.  SIX YEARS IS A LONG TIME TO HAVE POTENTIALLY SERIOUS MECHANICAL ISSUES UNADDRESSED.  THANK YOU. *JB",

AT ABOUT 74K MILES, THE SAME LIGHT AND EMISSIONS CONTROL MESSAGE REAPPEARED.  I RETURNED TO THE SAME DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE, THAT IT WAS TESTED AND EVERYTHING WORKED FINE.  THE CODES WERE RESET AND THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO ME.  SHORTLY THEREAFTER, HOWEVER, THE LIGHT AND EMISSIONS CONTROL MESSAGE REAPPEARED.  THIS TIME, THE SHOP FOREMAN AT THE DEALERSHIP SUGGESTED THAT I ARRANGE TO LEAVE THE VEHICLE FOR EXTENDED TESTING.  I AGREED TO DO SO.  AFTER A DAY OR TWO OF TESTS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS ON THE VEHICLE WERE MALFUNCTIONING.  I WAS TOLD, HOWEVER, THAT DESPITE THE 7 YEAR/70,000 MILE FEDERALLY MANDATED EMISSIONS SYSTEM WARRANTY, VOLKSWAGEN WOULD NOT PAY FOR THE REPAIR, BECAUSE THE VEHICLE NOW HAD ABOUT 79K MILES ON IT.  FROM SPEAKING WITH SEVERAL SOURCES, INCLUDING THE DEALERSHIP'S FOREMAN AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF VOLKSWAGEN, I LEARNED THAT THE VACUUM LINE REPAIR PERFORMED AT 61K MILES WAS NOT RELATED TO THE EMISSIONS MESSAGE THAT FIRST APPEARED AT THAT TIME.  IT APPEARS THAT, ALTHOUGH THE VECHILE HAS CLEARLY INDICATED A PROBLEM WITH THE EMISSIONS CONTROL SYSTEM SINCE THE INCIDENT AT 61K MILES, NO ONE TOOK THE TIME TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM UNTIL, UNFORTUNATELY, AFTER THE WARRANTY PERIOD HAD RUN.*AK",

FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN SEEING POLES, TREES, OR BUILDING SIDINGS WHILE MAKING A TURN, OR WHEN VIEWING HIGHWAY EXIT SIGNS WHILE PASSING THEM ON THE PARKWAY.  THERE'S AN ACCORDION EFFECT; VERTICAL OBJECTS INCHWORM; LETTERS EXPAND AND CONTRACT.  JUST MOVING MY HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE BY A FEW INCHES CAN PRODUCE THIS EFFECT.  I CAN'T SAY YET THAT IT'S HAZARDOUS BUT IT'S CERTAINLY DISTRACTING.  MEANWHILE, I CAN'T GET THE DEALER TO EVEN SIT IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND TELL ME IT'S MY IMAGINATION.  I WAS REFERRED TO THE FOLLOWING MESSAGES:  (1) I'VE SEEN SEVERAL REPORTS OF THIS.  TIME TO GET A NEW DEALER.  YOU SHOULD GET NEW GLASS UNDER WARRANTY.  (2) MY '99 WAS 5000 MILES NEW WHEN I REALIZED THE WINDSHIELD HAD A DISTORTION AND  RIPPLE EFFECT. THEY REPLACED IT NO CHARGE, BUT THE SECOND ONE IS AS BAD AS  THE FIRST ONE.  (3) HAS ANYONE WITH A '99 B5 NOTICED DISTORTIONS IN THE FRONT AND REAR GLASS? I'VE HAD MY WINDSHIELD AND REAR GLASS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY, AND THE NEW GLASS IS ALSO DISTORTED - ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE AS BAD AS THE ORIGINAL.   (4) WHEN I RECENTLY HAD A GENUINE NEW VW WINDSCREEN INSTALLED AFTER DAMAGE I NOTICED AN OPTICAL DISTORTION RIGHT OF MY STRAIGHT AHEAD VISION. THIS IS DISGRACEFUL QUALITY CONTROL FROM A MAJOR MOTOR MANUFACTURER AND THEIR AUTHORIZED REPAIR DEALER.  (5) THERE APPEARS TO BE A DEFECT IN THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD. A WAVY, VERTICAL LINE.  THE SERVICE MANAGER LOOKED AT MINE AND FOUND IT RIGHT AWAY, HE ALSO TOLD ME IT WAS NOTED ON SEVERAL NEW 2000'S ON THE LOT, AND THAT ANOTHER CUSTOMER HAS A REALLY SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH IT. CHECK THE WINDSHIELD BY LOOKING OUT AT A STRAIGHT LINE, THE SIDE OF A BUILDING OR A POLE, AND MOVING YOUR EYES UP AND DOWN AS WELL AS RIGHT AND LEFT.  VW IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM.  I AM NOT HAVING THE WINDSHIELD REPLACED, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE MESS THEY MADE ON A",
