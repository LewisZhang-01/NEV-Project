I heard a warning chime and saw an indicator \"Service Power Steering\" message on my display.  I managed to steer the vehicle into a parking lot to inspect the engine bay and fuses.  When I restarted the engine, the power steering was functioning.  The power steering failure has not reoccured since it initially happened.  My vehicle is a 2019 year model.  I noticed that GM has a recall for 2021 year models for this very same problem.  I'm wondering if the recall shouldn't be expanded given my experience.",

We have had it into the dealership and they found the same code but were unable to get it to recreate for them. It is not something that happens every day so I would have to leave it with them for a long period of time and that is not an option.
