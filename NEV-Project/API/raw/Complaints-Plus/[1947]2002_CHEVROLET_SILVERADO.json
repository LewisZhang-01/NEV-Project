There was another car in front of mine and as I approached it I began to lightly apply the brakes. The brake pedal went all the way to the floor with no decrease in speed. Fortunately I was able to switch back to the through lane and avoid an accident. While I was able to avoid an accident there was definitely a risk of injury to myself and the occupants of the other vehicle. When I was able to inspect the vehicle I found that the brakeline adjacent to the fuel tank was rusted through which caused a complete brake failure. I do the vehicle maintenance personally and have since made necessary repairs to the brake system. I was aware of problems with the brakelines on this vintage truck being prone to failure due to rusting. As I was making repairs it was obvious the routing of the brakelines was such as to making the rusting more likely to happen.",

I HAVE TALKED WITH OTHER CHEVROLET SILVERADO, YUKON AND SUBURBAN OWNERS AND THEY ALL SHARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES WITH THEIR BRAKE LINES.

THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO DENT FROM EXTERNAL CONTACT OF ANY KIND. I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF THIS VEHICLE. IT HAS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED AND WE DO NOT LIVE IN AN AREA OF MUCH WINTER WEATHER ( SALT CORROSION ).

I HAVE CONTACTED CHEVROLET AND WILL BE TAKING THE TRUCK TO A DEALER MONDAY 7/24. THE REP I SPOKE WITH AT CHEVY SPENT MOST OF THE CONVERSATION TELLING ME THAT BECAUSE OF THE AGE AND MILEAGE OF THE VEHICLE THAT THE REPAIRS WERE MY RESPONSIBILITY. THAT'S FINE BUT I TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH THEM. THIS IS NOT A MAINTENANCE ISSUE. IT IS A DEFECTIVE OR POORLY DESIGNED PART THAT COULD EASILY RESULT IN FIRE, ACCIDENTS AND EVEN BODILY HARM OR THE LOSS OF LIFE. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EXCUSE FOR A LEAKING METAL FUEL LINE THAT HAS NEVER BEEN DAMAGED IN ANY WAY AT ALL. FROM THE INTERNET FORUMS FOR DURAMAX  OWNERS I SEE THAT THIS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON PROBLEM. I ASSURE THERE ARE MANY LESS THAN SAFE IMPROVISED FIXES ON THESE LOUSY FUEL LINES ON THE ROADS AS WE SPEAK BECAUSE GM IS NOT ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PROBLEM. THIS IS SHAMEFUL AND INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THERE HAVE BEEN ISSUES WITH THE METAL BRAKE LINES AS WELL.   I LIKE MY TRUCK A GREAT DEAL, HOWEVER THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED.

THE BRAKE LINES WERE COMPLETELY RUSTED THROUGH. AND NOW THE FUEL PUMP IS OUT AND THEY FUEL LINES ARE RUSTED AS WELL. WHAT GETS ME IS I PAID SO MUCH EXTRA FOR EXTRA RUST PROOFING. IT SHOULD NOT HAVE RUSTED THROUGH THIS BAD AT ONLY 125000 MILES. THE ANTILOCK BRAKE MODULE IS PLACED WHERE THE RUST CAN GET AT IT RIGHT UNDER THE CHASSIS PART UNPROTECTED. SO MUCH FOR SAFETY. THAT WENT OUT AT ABOUT 75000 MILES BUT JUST GOT IT REPLACED AT 100000 MILES OR SO. THE BRAKE LINES AND THE FUEL LINES ARE A JOKE ON THIS VEHICLE. I USED TO MAKE AND INSPECT AND TEST THEM AT A FACTORY AND THESE WOULD HAVE NEVER PASSED INSPECTION FOR CORROSION TEST. BUT THEY WEREN'T MADE THERE. THE FACTORY IS CLOSED. NO UNION WAGES EITHER, BUT WE DID GOOD WORK NOT THIS GARBAGE. IT COST OVER $500 FOR MODULE AND IT COST 2500 FOR THE REST OF BRAKE JOB. AND NOW THE FUEL LINES AND PUMP AND FILTER WILL COST OVER $1000.

AS I SAT WAITING FOR THE LIGHT TO TURN GREEN, MY BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR. I WASN'T SURE WHAT HAPPENED AND THOUGHT MAYBE I'D PUMP MY BRAKES UP AND EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE. NO SUCH LUCK. I PULLED OVER INTO A GAS STATION AND LOOKED UNDER MY TRUCK AND SAW MY FLUID LEAKING VERY BADLY, COMING DOWN OVER MY GAS TANK. SINCE I HAD JUST LEFT MY HOME AND WAS VERY CLOSE, I DECIDED TO DRIVE IT HOME AND HAVE A BETTER LOOK. AS I DROVE THE HALF MILE DRIVE, MY BRAKE FLUID COMPLETELY DRAINED DRY. FORTUNATELY FOR ME, THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC ON  THE STREETS AND NO OBSTACLES IN THE WAY. ANYWAY, WHEN I GOT HOME AND LOOKED UNDER MY TRUCK AND SAW THAT MY BRAKELINE LOOKED LIKE IT COMPLETELY EXPLODED AND WAS RUSTED OUT, I CALLED MY DEALER AND ASKED IF THERE WAS A SAFETY RECALL FOR THESE BRAKE LINES, AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THEM TO REPAIR MY BRAKELINE, SO I HAD MY TRUCK TOWED TO MY DEALER, AND THEY PRECEDED TO WORK ON MY TRUCK. AS THEY INSPECTED IT, I WAS INFORMED THAT \"ALL\" OF MY LINES WERE RUSTED OUT BADLY AND UNSAFE. THIS COST ME APPROXIMATELY $700 TO REPAIR ALL OF THE LINES, BUT MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT THIS COULD HAVE TURNED OUT A LOT DIFFERENTLY. WE HAVE 8 CHILDREN, 12 GRAND CHILDREN, AND FORTUNATELY THIS VEHICLE WAS NOT ON THE HIGHWAY WITH ANY OF THE LITTLE ONES IN IT. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR OVER 30 YEARS AND I FEEL VERY FORTUNATE THAT CIRCUMSTANCES WERE WHAT THEY WERE.

I WENT TO STOP THE TRUCK AND THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT RIGHT TO THE FLOOR.  I WAS UNABLE TO STOP.  I PUMPED THE BRAKES AND THEN HELD FIRMLY ON THE PEDAL.  I QUICKLY OBSERVED CROSS TRAFFIC IN THE ROAD BEFORE ME AND I TURNED SHARPLY ONTO THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY WEST JUST BEING NARROWLY MISSED BY WEST BOUND TRAFFIC.   I HAD MY WIFE FOLLOW ME TO THE DEALERSHIP AND I COASTED INTO THE DEALERSHIP WITHOUT ANY BRAKES AT ALL.       THE FOLLOWING DAY I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP I NEEDED ALL NEW BRAKE LINES AND BRAKE CALIBERS. THEY ASKED ME TO COME DOWN AND VIEW THE UNDER PORTIONS OF OUR PICK-UP AND I DID SO.   THE TRUCK WAS UP ON THE HOIST AND MECHANIC AND SERVICE REP SHOWED ME HE WAS UNABLE TO TAKE THE BROKEN LINE OUT OF THE BRAKE CALIBER WITHOUT SNAPPING OFF THE NUT HOLDING THE BRAKE LINE.   THEY SHOWED ME THE REMAINING BRAKE LINES ALL IN STAGES OF RUSTING OUT INCLUDING THE ONE LINE THAT BLEW OPEN CAUSING THE SUDDEN LEAK AND \"NO BRAKES\" PROBLEM.  THE REPAIR SERVICE COST ME APPROXIMATELY $2800,00.   I COMPLAINED TO THE SERVICE MANAGER [XXX], I TOLD HIM I HAVE DRIVEN GM CARS FOR DECADES ON MICHIGAN ROADS AND NEVER HAD ANY BRAKE LINE RUST OUT AND FAIL.   I WAS TOLD THE BRAKE LINE FAILURE WAS DUE TO THE SALTY CONDITIONS DRIVING IN MICHIGAN WINTERS. HIS EXPLANATION STILL DID NOT MAKE MUCH SENSE TO ME.   I KNOW CAR MANUFACTURES ARE VERY AWARE OF THESE TYPE ROAD CONDITIONS IN THE MIDWEST AND NORTH EAST. THE DEALERSHIP THAT I TOOK MY TRUCK TO IS THE ONLY REPAIR FACILITY I HAVE TAKEN IT TO FOR MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS. THAT WAS A VERY EXPENSIVE REPAIR BILL.

WE HAVE NEVER HAD LINES RUST ON ANYTHING LIKE THIS AND NEVER HAD COMPLETE BRAKE FAILURE.  WE FEEL THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.  IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE REPAIR, BUT IT IS SERIOUS.

AFTER DOING EXTENSIVE RESEARCH I FOUND THAT GM HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS WEAK SUN GEAR SHELL SINCE AT LEAST 1998. THE PROBLEM IS THAT GM DIDN'T REMOVE THE FAULTY PARTS FROM THEIR INVENTORY, ALTHOUGH THEY UPDATED THE PART SOMETIME IN2000 GM MIXED THE NEW PARTS IN WITH THE OLD SO THAT THEIR STATISTICS WOULD SHOW THAT NOT ALL 4L60E TRANSMISSIONS FAILED. TRANSMISSION REBUILDERS SAY YOU CAN ONLY TELL THE FAULTY SHELL FROM THE UPDATED VERSION BY THE SERIAL NUMBER INSIDE THE FAULTY SUN GEAR SHELL. MANY ENGINEERING ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN TRANSMISSIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE PAST TWO DECADES WITH MATERIALS AND LUBRICANTS. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FOR SUCH A MASSIVE GM TRANSMISSION FAILURE. WHAT MAKES IT SO BAD AFTER THE TEN DOLLAR PART FAILS GM CHARGES $3,000 FOR A REBUILT TRANSMISSION. IF THE FAULTY SUN GEAR SHELL WAS REPLACED BEFORE TOTAL FAILURE THE PRICE IS LESS THAN $1,000. I WATCHED AS MY TRANSMISSION WAS BEING REBUILT AND THERE WAS NO VISIBLE WEAR ON ANY OTHER PARTS. IT LOOKED LIKE BRAND NEW EXCEPT THIS FAULTY SUN GEAR SHELL. IF THIS PROBLEM IS SO WIDELY KNOWN FOR SO MANY YEARS THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY WHY WASNT THERE A FORCED RECALL?

I REMOVED THE DRUM AND BRAKE SHOES AND NOTICED THAT ON BOTH SETS OF SHOES, LEFT AND RIGHT, THE PADS OF THE SHOES WERE NOT REALLY WORN, BUT THE ACTUAL LINING THAT THE SHOES ARE ATTACHED TO WERE WORN AT THE VERY BOTTOM ON THE DRIVERS SIDE AND THE VERY TOP ON THE PASSENGER SIDE, BOTH WHERE THERE ARE NO PADS. I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS THAT CAME WITH THE NEW SHOES, REPLACED EVERYTHING, AND STILL NO BRAKES. I THEN BOUGHT A NEW CABLE AND SWAPPED IT OUT, THINKING THE CABLE MAY BE STRETCHED. STILL NO BRAKES. I REMOVED THE WHEEL AND DRUM ONCE AGAIN AND HAD SOMEONE DEPRESS THE PARKING BRAKE. I NOTICED THE ACTUATOR WORKING, SO I REASSEMBLED EVERYTHING, AND STILL NO BRAKES. I THEN CONTACTED GM CUSTOMER SERVICE TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY RECALLS FOR THIS PROBLEM, I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOT. I WAS TOLD THAT I CAN TAKE MY TRUCK TO A CERTIFIED CHEVY DEALER FOR THEM TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM, AT MY EXPENSE, BEING THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT IN OVER 3 1/2 YEARS, I CAN NOT AFFORD THIS. I WAS TOLD THERE IS NOTHING FURTHER THAT CAN BE DONE TO HELP ME. I HAVE LESS THAN 2 WEEKS FOR MY TRUCK TO PASS INSPECTION, IF NOT, THEN I MUST PAY FINES AND COSTS WHEN I DO REREGISTER MY VEHICLE. HOW DO I GET MY VEHICLE TO PASS INSPECTION WHEN THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A DEFECT IN THEIR DESIGN. I'M HITTING A BRICK WALL EVERYWHERE I TURN.

AT THE SHOP I FOUND OUT THAT THE VEHICLE IS COMPLETELY RUSTED UNDERNEATH AND ALL OF MY BRAKE LINES BROKE BECAUSE OF IT.  THEY HAD TO REPLACE 40 FEET OF BRAKE LINES AND REFILL THE BRAKE FLUID THAT WAS LOST AS A RESULT OF THE BROKEN LINES.  I WAS ALSO INFORMED BY THE MECHANIC THAT NOT ONLY THE BRAKE LINES, BUT FUEL LINES ARE RUSTED TOO.  ALL OF THAT HAS TO BE REPLACED.  MOREOVER, THE VEHICLE?S SPRINGS AND CHASSIS ARE RUSTED TOO.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE VEHICLE NEEDS A SPECIAL PROTECTIVE COATING UNDERNEATH TO AVOID THAT IT FALLS APART.  AT THIS TIME I'M TALKING TO GMC COMPANY REGARDING MY ISSUE, WHICH DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY WILL COVER MY EXPENSES OR REPAIR THE VEHICLE ON RECALL BASIS.  I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY WILL DO THE INVESTIGATION, AND WILL CONTACT ME SOON.  I FEEL RESPONSIBLE TO REPORT SUCH AN UNFORTUNATE SITUATION, SO IT WILL BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER, IN ORDER FOR OTHERS TO AVOID ANY ACCIDENTS OR DEATHS.  *TR",

THEY ALSO INFORMED ME OF A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN THAT HAS BEEN ISSUED ON THIS CODE BY GM, WHICH THE DEALER AND THE GM CUSTOMER SERVICE REP. NEGLECTED TO DIVULGE.

IN CONCLUSION, THE DEALER WAS THE FIRST TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM AND RECOMMEND A SOLUTION OF REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION WITHOUT ANY FURTHER BREAKDOWN OF THE TRANSMISSION (THEY ALREADY KNEW OF A PROB.  GM CUSTOMER SERVICE KNEW THIS AND WAS UNWILLING TO COMMIT TO HELPING ME.  *TR",

THESE GM TRUCKS ALSO HAVE DEFECTIVE STEERING BOXES THAT FEEL LOOSE WHEN ROUNDING CORNERS. I HAVE HAD A 1995, 2001, 2002 CHEVY AND GMC WITH SAME PROBLEM THEY NEVER STOOD BEHIND THIS PROBLEM OTHER THAN TO PUT SOME GREASE IN WHICH WAS A TEMPORARY FIX.  *TR",

A LEAK DEVELOPED IN THE POWER BRAKE BOOSTER/HYDRO-BOOST SYSTEM AND POWER STEERING FLUID WAS LEAKING ONTO MY HOT EXHAUST MANIFOLD.  SMOKE WAS POURING FROM UNDER MY HOOD.  I SUSPECT A SMALL FIRE BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF SMOKE.  BY THE TIME I PULLED OFF THE ROAD AND OPENED THE HOOD ALL I SAW WAS SMOKE FROM SOMETHING LEAKING ON THE MANIFOLD.   I GOT ONLINE AND FOUND THIS RECALL INFORMATION FOR 2004-2005 CHEVY TRUCKS BUT NOT 2002.  I WANTED TO INFORM YOU THAT THERE MAY BE A NEED TO RECALL 2002 SILVERADO TRUCKS AS WELL.  RESEARCHING DIESELPLACE.COM AND DIESELPAGE.COM THIS PROBLEM IS COMMON AND WIDESPREAD.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  MARCH 2005  DEAR CHEVROLET CUSTOMER:  THIS NOTICE IS SENT TO YOU IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NATIONAL TRAFFIC AND MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY ACT.    REASON FOR THIS RECALL: GENERAL MOTORS HAS DECIDED THAT A DEFECT, WHICH RELATES TO MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY, EXISTS IN CERTAIN 2004 MODEL YEAR CHEVROLET KODIAK AND CERTAIN 2004 AND 2005 MODEL YEAR CHEVROLET AVALANCHE, EXPRESS, SILVERADO, AND SUBURBAN VEHICLES. ON SOME OF THESE VEHICLES, THE HYDRAULIC BRAKE BOOSTER'S PRESSURE ACCUMULATOR MAY CRACK AND/OR SEPARATE FROM THE HYDRO-BOOST ASSEMBLY DURING NORMAL VEHICLE OPERATING CONDITIONS. IF A SEPARATION WERE TO OCCUR AND THE HOOD OF THE VEHICLE WERE OPEN, FRAGMENTS FROM THE ACCUMULATOR COULD CAUSE INJURY TO PEOPLE IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA. IN ADDITION, THE PRESENCE OF THIS CRACK OR FRACTURED SURFACE COULD ALLOW THE HYDRAULIC FLUID TO LEAK FROM THE ACCUMULATOR CIRCUIT OF THE BOOSTER ASSEMBLY. THE LOSS OF FLUID WOULD CAUSE INCREASED STEERING AND BRAKING EFFORT.  WHAT WILL BE DONE: YOUR CHEVROLET DEALER WILL INSPECT THE HYDRAULIC BRAKE BOOSTER, AND REPLACE IT IF NECESSARY. THIS SERVICE WILL BE PERFORMED FOR YOU AT NO CHARGE.  *TR",

MY BRAKE LINES RUSTED THROUGH IN THREE SEPARATE INCIDENTS THIS YEAR.  FIRST, THE FRONT WHEEL SPEED SENSORS/ABS SYSTEM FAILED IN APRIL, 2010.  NEXT, IN JULY, THE FRONT PART OF THE LINES GAVE WAY WHEN BEING BACKED OUT OF THE GARAGE AFTER GETTING AN OIL CHANGE.  THAT GARAGE REPLACED THE FRONT PART OF THE BRAKE LINES ONLY.  FINALLY IN SEPTEMBER, THE REAR BRAKE LINES RUSTED THROUGH RIGHT IN MY DRIVEWAY.  LUCKILY, I WAS NOT TRAVELING AT SPEED FOR EITHER OF THESE EVENTS, BUT IT WAS A MAJOR EXPENSE AND INCONVENIENCE, ESPECIALLY HAVING IT HAPPEN TWICE LIKE THAT.  I ALSO HAD THE LINE ON THE POWER STEERING FLUID COOLER RUST THROUGH IN THE APRIL REPAIR, AND THERE IS WAY MORE RUST IN GENERAL ON THE UNDERCARRIAGE THAN THERE SHOULD BE.

FAILURE HAPPENED WHILE PARKING TRUCK AT HOME.  NO ACCIDENT OCCURRED, BUT I WAS LUCKY. THIS FAILURE COULD HAVE CAUSED A FATAL ACCIDENT.

I HAVE A 2002 CHEVY SILVERADO 2500 PICKUP TRUCK. DUE TO CORRODED AND EXCESSIVE RUSTED-OUT BRAKE LINES, I EXPERIENCED TOTAL BRAKE LINE FAILURE CAUSING ME TO GET INTO AN ACCIDENT. THIS HAPPENED IN NOVEMBER OF 2008 AND; I ONLY HAD 50,825 MILES ON MY VEHICLE AT THE TIME.  LUCKILY FOR ME, I WAS (FOR THE MOST PART) IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC.  IF I WASN'T, I TRULY BELIEVE THINGS COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE RESULTING IN SEVERE INJURY OR DEATH.  THIS HAPPENED ON ROUTE 495 NORTH, A THREE-LANE HIGHWAY NEAR LOWELL MASSACHUSETTS.  AS IT WAS, I REAR-ENDED A PICKUP TRUCK IN FRONT OF ME THAT SUBSEQUENTLY HIT THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF HER.  FORTUNATELY... NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY HURT.  I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK WHAT MIGHT OF HAPPENED IF I WAS DOING 65 - 70 MPH AND HAD TO AVOID ANOTHER VEHICLE OR BRAKE QUICKLY.    I CONTACTED GM ABOUT THIS BUT NEVER RECEIVED A REPLY BACK.    MY TOTAL FAILURE OF BRAKES WAS VERIFIED AT THE SCENE BY THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER (CERTIFIED MA MECHANIC), THE STATE POLICE PERSON, MY INSURANCE COMPANY, AND LANNAN CHEVROLET OF LOWELL WHO HAD TO REPLACE EVERY BIT OF BRAKE LINE(S). *TR",

WHILE EXITING THE RAMP OFF THE HIGHWAY, AT 50 MPH, WITH A 7,600 POUND CAR TRAILER IN TOW, I DEPRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL, AND IT WENT TO THE FLOOR! ONLY WITH THE USE OF THE MANUAL OVERRIDE OF MY ELECTRIC TRAILER BRAKES WAS I ABLE TO STOP, AVOIDING A NEAR MISS COLLISION, AND A SERIOUS, PERHAPS FATAL ACCIDENT. IT WAS DETERMINED ONE OF THE BRAKE LINES LEAKED AND FAILED AS A \"RUST AND CORROSION\". THE VEHICLE HAD 52,300 AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, AND IN FLORIDA SINCE PURCHASING NEW. WITH THE HELP OF A FRIEND, A TEMPORARY REPAIR WAS MADE USING A COMPRESSION FITTING TO ALLOW US TO CONTINUE OUR 90 MILE TRIP HOME. THE TRUCK WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALERSHIP WHO CONFIRMED \"RUST AND CORROSION\" WAS THE CAUSE, HOWEVER THERE WERE NO RECALLS, OR WARRANTY, AND I WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE COST OF $738.00 TO REPLACE ALL THE LINES. AT THAT TIME I HAD LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO AUTHORIZE THEM TO PROCEED. HOWEVER AFTER COMPLETION OF THE WORK AND MY INSPECTION, THE LINES WERE INSTALLED USING INTERCONNECTING FITTINGS, AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS, AND NOT CONTINUOUS LINES AS WAS ORIGINALLY SUPPLIED BY THE FACTORY, NOR WAS PLACEMENT. I NOW QUESTION THE SAFETY OF THE REPAIR. THE DEALERSHIP ADVISED THE WORK THEY PERFORMED WAS THE METHOD AUTHORIZED BY GM, AND CONTINUOUS LINES WERE NOT AVAILABLE FROM THE FACTORY. THIS IS PROBABLY BECAUSE GM DOES NOT OFFER THEM, AS THE BRAKE LINES SHOULD HAVE LASTED THE LIFE OF THE TRUCK. I HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE MATERIAL USED FOR THE BRAKE LINES WERE OF VERY POOR QUALITY. I HAVE CONTACTED GM AND CONTINUE TO AWAIT A RESPONSE FROM THEIR ENGINEERING. THE DEALERSHIP HAS FURTHER ADVISED THERE WAS NOTHING FURTHER THEY COULD DO, AND THE GM AREA REPRESENTATIVE CONFIRMED THAT WITH THEM. I QUESTION IF IT TAKES A NUMBER OF DEATHS AS A RESULT OF POOR QUALITY BRAKE LINES BEFORE GM TAKES SOME ACTION. IN SEARCHING THE INTERNET, I HAVE FOUND MANY REPORTS RELATING TO THE  SAME PROBLEM.

BECAUSE IT IS LIKELY THE SENSOR WILL BE DAMAGED IN THE REMOVAL PROCESS.  MY POINT IS, THIS CAN AND WILL HAPPEN AGAIN AND IS A HIGH RISK TO DAMAGE.  PROPERTY, PERSONS.   IN THIS CASE THE RECALL FIX ONLY LASTED 36,000 MILES.  I ONLY HAVE 86,000 MILE TOTAL ON THIS PICKUP.  MY FAMILY AND OTHER FAMILIES ARE AT RISK WITH OUT A PERMANANT FIX TO THIS ABS SYSTEM.   IS A ONE TIME RECALL FIX THE NORMAL WITH OEM'S ON RECALL EVEN THOUGHT THE FIX DID NOT FULLY FIX THE RECALL ISSUE?  PLEASE REVIEW AND GET BACK WITH ME. *TR",

THE PROBLEM WAS NOTICEABLE AT  12,000 MILES BY EXCESSIVE PEDAL TRAVEL, THE SAME WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE. NO ACTION WAS TAKEN OR NOTICE OF BRAKE WEAR INDICATED BY THE DEALER WHEN NOTIFIED.

UNABLE TO BELIEVE MY BRAKES WERE WORN OUT ( I'M 65 YEARS OLD AND HAVE NEVER HAD A VEHICLES' BRAKES WEAR OUT ANY WHERE NEAR THIS MILEAGE) I DECIDED TO DRIVE IT MORE OFTEN TO REMOVE THE RUST.

THEY DID NOT CHARGE ME A DIME, SAID THAT THEY WOULD WORK IT OUT WITH LOCAL REP.  I WILL GET THE VEHICLE FIXED, BUT HOW DOES THIS CORRECT THE PROBLEM? *TR",

I TOOK IT TO CENTURY CHEVROLET AND WAS TOLD THAT ALL 4 ROTORS AND PADS NEED TO BE REPLACED. WITH ONLY 38,000 MILES ON THE TRUCK THAT SEEMED CRAZY. WHEN I QUESTIONED THIS THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HARDLY EVER SEE THIS BRAKE PROBLEM HAPPENING AND IT'S BECAUSE I DON'T DRIVE THE TRUCK ENOUGH SO IT'S RUSTED OUT THE PARTS. RUSTY PARTS IN COLORADO IS ANOTHER THING THAT DIDN'T MAKE SENSE. THEY COULD ONLY DO THE FRONT BRAKE REPAIR BECAUSE OF MY CAMPER SO THEY REPLACED THE FRONT ROTORS AND PADS FOR A LITTLE OVER $400. I STARTED CHECKING AROUND ABOUT THE BRAKES AND DISCOVERED ON THE INTERNET THAT THERE WERE MANY SIMILAR STORIES FROM OTHER SILVERADO OWNERS. THERE IS A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO OWN THESE VEHICLES WITH PARTS THAT JUST DETERIORATE. CHEVROLET CONTINUES TO DENY THAT IT'S DEFECTIVE PARTS AND INSTEAD TELLS PEOPLE THAT IT'S THEIR FAULT FOR NOT USING THE BRAKES ENOUGH. WE USE THIS TRUCK MOSTLY IN THE SUMMER FOR CAMPING AND TRAVELING BUT DO DRIVE IT IN THE WINTER SO I?M UNSURE WHAT IS CONSIDERED THE PROPER AMOUNT OF ?BRAKING? TIME. THE DEALER COULDN?T GIVE ME AN ANSWER ON THAT QUESTION. THIS IS HAPPENING TO A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY SHOULD BE WARNED THAT PART OF THE MAINTENANCE ON THIS VEHICLE IS $1,000 BRAKE JOB EVERY $25,000 MILES OR YOU WON'T HAVE ANY BRAKES.

I NEVER HEARD OF A PARKING BRAKE NEEDING ADJUSTMENT AFTER A YEAR, AND HOW COULD IT  POSSIBLY BE WORE OUT? I NEVER USED THE THING. I FIGURED , IT WOULDN'T BE LONG BEFORE THEY HAD A RECALL ON IT. NOW IT IS ABOUT  4 YEARS LATER, I CALL G.M. TO FIND OUT IF THERE IS A RECALL OR IF THEY WOULD HELP OUT WITH THE COSTS. I ALSO HAVE THE 100,000 MILE 5 YEAR G.M. WARRANTY. OF COURSE THEY ADMITTED NOTHING AND DIDN'T HELP AT ALL. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND HAD IT DIAGNOSED LIKE THEY ASKED ME TO. THE DEALER WANTED $855 TO REPLACE THE SHOES AND DRUMS WHICH SOMEHOW DESTROYED THEMSELVES OVER THE LAST 4 YEARS THAT I HAD A NON OPERATIONAL PARKING BRAKE. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? I KNOW A LITTLE ABOUT CARS. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN UNLESS THERE IS SOMETHING DEFECTIVE. IT WASN'T A FUN DAY DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO WON'T LISTEN TO REASON, OR SHALL I SAY WON'T ADMIT TO IT.  *JB",

UPON INTERNAL INSPECTION AT THE LOCAL AAMOCO TRANSMISSION REPAIR SHOP IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY AN INFERIOR/DEFECTIVE SUN SHELL SPLINE.   THE TRANSMISSION EXPERT AT THE SHOP STATED THAT THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM IN GM TRUCKS AND THAT IT WAS KNOWN BY GM AND AS A RESULT A NEW STRONGER SUN SHELL SPLINE HAD BEEN INSTALLED, AFTER SUPPLIES OF THE INFERIOR/DEFECTIVE PARTS WERE EXHAUSTED.  I DID FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE WEB AND WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM THE TRANSMISSION SHOPS STATEMENTS WITH MANY COMPLAINTS FOUND BY GM TRUCK OWNERS FOR THE SAME PREMATURE AND EXPENSIVE TRANSMISSION FAILURES.

WELL, NORMAL ALMOST CAUSED A WRECK ON A DOWN HILL T ROAD WITH MY WIFE WITH ME. I PHONED CHEVROLET CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CENTER (FILE 1-212176923) FOR HELP. A WASTE OF TIME. I PHONED CHEVROLET MOTOR DIVISION (1800-222-1020) AND ALL THEY SUGGESTED WAS TO TAKE THE TRUCK BACK TO THE DEALER, A 30 MILE DRIVE ONE WAY. THEY DIDN'T HELP IN FOUR OTHER VISITS .

MY 4-YEAR OLD SON WHO WAS IN THE REAR SEAT, UNBUCKLED HIMSELF AND REACHED OVER THE DRIVER'S SEAT AND PRESSED THE SEAT POSITION MEMORY BUTTON.  THE SEAT RETRACTED AND PINNED HIM BETWEEN THE SEAT AND THE B-PILLAR.  AS A RESULT MY SON WAS ASPHYXIATED AND NEARLY DIED.  SINCE HIS CHEST WAS IMMEDIATELY CRUSHED, HE COULD NOT YELL FOR HELP AND HAD I NOT TURNED TO CHECK ON HIM FOR ANOTHER MINUTE HE WOULD HAVE NOT RECOVERED.  LUCKILY FOR US AND FOR THE HELP OF A QUICK RESPONDING RESCUE SQUAD, PARAMEDICS, AND EMERGENCY ROOM STAFF, MY SON IS ALIVE AND APPEARS TO BE WELL. MY COMPLAINT LIES WITH THE FACTS THAT THE MEMORY BUTTONS ARE 1) ACCESSIBLE BY A CHILD FROM THE REAR SEAT, AND 2) THAT (UNLIKE A MODERN GARAGE DOOR OPENERS) THE MOTOR MECHANISM WHICH GENERATES A GREAT DEAL OF POWER, DOES NOT SENSE ANY LEVEL OF RESISTANCE.  I HAVE SINCE DISCONNECTED THE SEAT POSITION MEMORY BUTTONS ON THE DOOR PANEL.  HOWEVER, THIS DESIGN IS PRESENT IN ALL LATE MODEL GM SUVS AND GIVEN THEIR POPULARITY, THIS DESIGN REPRESENTS A GRAVE DANGER TO MANY US FAMILIES AND THEIR CHILDREN.

THE GIRL WAS PINNED BETWEEN THE SEAT AND A PART OF THE FRAME KNOWN AS THE B-PILLAR BEHIND THE DOOR OF THE 2001 CHEVY TAHOE, POLICE SAID.

HOWEVER, AT 34,000 MILES (NOVEMBER OF 2004) THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT. MY WIFE WAS DRIVING TO WORK AND NEEDED TO ACCELERATE TO MERGE ONTO THE FREEWAY AND INSTANTLY THE TRANSMISSION BEGAN TO WHINE AND STOPPED OPERATING WHICH PLACED HER INTO THE PATH OF A LARGE TRUCK BEARING DOWN ON HER RATHER QUICKLY. THANKFULLY SHE WAS ABLE TO GLIDE OUT OF THE PATH OF THE TRUCK TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. WE HAD THE TAHOE TOWED BACK TO OUR DEALERSHIP AND WE DETERMINED THAT THE TRANSMISSION \"SUN SHELL\" HAD FAILED AND WOULD BE REPLACED. OUR DEALER ASSURED US THAT THIS WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM, BECAUSE THE NEW PARTS WERE DESIGNED TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE. OUR DEALER FURTHER STATED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN REPAIRING A LARGE NUMBER OF VEHICLES WITH THESE FAILURES.   OUR TAHOE WENT OFF OF IT'S NEW CAR WARRANTY ON MILEAGE NOT NUMBER OF MONTHS SOMETIME IN APRIL OF 2005 (36 MONTHS WOULD HAVE ENDED THIS AUGUST). JUST THIS PAST MONDAY (SEPTEMBER 19, 2005) MY WIFE WAS AGAIN ON HER WAY TO WORK WHEN AGAIN THE TRANSMISSION FAILED IN OUR 2002 TAHOE. THE MILEAGE WAS APPROX: 41,000 ( TOTAL PERIOD OF MILES AND THE LENGTH OF TIME FROM THE PREVIOUS FAILURE WAS APPROX: 7 MONTHS). THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE THE SAME, SHE WAS ACCELERATING TO MERGE ONTO THE FREEWAY AND AGAIN THE TRANSMISSION BEGAN TO WHINE AND SLIP. THIS TIME SHE WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE DRIVING TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND RELATIVE SAFETY. WE HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED BACK TO OUR DEALERSHIP AND AGAIN THE DEALER ADVISED THAT THE \"SUN SHELL\" HAD FAILED. I WENT TO PICK UP THE CAR ON FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 23, 2005 AND WHILE I WAS AT THE DEALERSHIP THE MECHANIC SHOWED ME THE DAMAGED PART AND A BENCH THAT CONTAINED SEVERAL DAMAGED \"SUN SHELL\". IT OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT TAKE MUCH EFFORT TO REALIZE THAT THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW WITH THIS PARTICULAR TRANSMISSION AND SPECIFICALLY THIS PART. *JB",

THEY HAVE DENIED ALL REQUESTS SO FAR STATING I DID NOT ROTATE TIRES PROPERLY. IN THE SERVICE BOOK THERE ARE 2 WAYS TO ROTATE TIRES ONE INCLUDES THE SPARE AND THE OTHER DOES NOT. I DID THE ONE THAT SHOWED THE FOUR TIRE ROTATION NOT FIVE BECAUSE THE SPARE IS A STEEL RIM NOT ALUMINUM LIKE THE OTHER FOUR DRIVE WHEELS.

I KNOW OF TWO OTHER '02 TRUCKS W/ THIS ENGINE THAT ALSO HAD THE SENSOR FAIL AND MANY OTHERS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED WHILE DOING RESEARCH ON THIS PROBLEM!    THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE PROBLEM LIES IN THE FACT THAT THE TRUCK SUDDENLY STOPS RUNNING FOR NO REASON AND YOU LOSE ALL POWER FOR THE BRAKES AND STEERING. AT TIMES IT WILL RESTART WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS ONCE YOU SHIFT TO NEUTRAL, BUT OTHER TIMES IT MAY NOT RESTART FOR A DAY OR MORE. THIS WAS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE FOR ME SINCE I TOW A 10K LBS. FIFTH-WHEEL WITH THE TRUCK! MY TRUCK STOPPED RUNNING FOUR TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF TWO WEEKS AS A RESULT OF THIS PROBLEM. EVERYTIME WAS WHILE TRAVELING IN TRAFFIC, WITH ONLY ONE OF THE TIMES WHILE BEING STOPPED AT A LIGHT!  MY TRUCK IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY DUE TO THE TIME LIMIT OF 36 MONTHS EXPIRING. TO HAVE SUCH A PART FAIL WITH ONLY 30K MILES ON THE ENGINE IS OUTRAGEOUS. ONE OF THE OTHER TRUCKS I KNOW OF HAD THE SENSOR FAIL AROUND 55K MILES. SAME PROBLEM, IT WOULD JUST STOP IN TRAFFIC OR WHEN PULLING OUT OF A LIGHT OR STOPPED TURN. AGAIN, A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE!!!

THE ENGINE JUST STOPS FOR NO REASON AT ANY TIME, HIGHWAY, SLOW MOVING, STOPPED, ETC. IT MAY RESTART, BUT THEN AGAIN IT MAY NOT FOR MANY HOURS! THE TRUCKS WITH THESE ENGINES IN THEM ARE GENERALLY TOWING LARGE TRAILERS BEHIND THEM. THIS COMPOUNDS THE SAFETY ASPECT OF THE PROBLEM. *JB",

I'VE READ NUMEROUS CONSUMER REPORTS AND TESTIMONIALS FROM OTHER CHEVY OWNERS COMPLAINING OF THE SAME PROBLEM.  GM CUSTOMER SERVICE TELLS ME THAT ADDITIVES IN THE GASOLINE IN MY AREA (NORTH TEXAS) CAUSE CARBON TO BUILD UP IN THE THROTTLE BODY CAUSING THE GAS PEDAL TO STICK.  I HAVE SEVERAL FRIENDS WHO LIVE IN MY AREA AND WHO OWN CHEVROLET PICKUPS.  NONE OF THEM HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR GAS PEDAL STICKING!!  THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR WHICH GM NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY!  IF I DO CLEAN THE THROTTLE BODY, THE PROBLEM IS LIKELY TO REOCCUR.  I GUESS GM WILL SUGGEST I LOBBY TO HAVE THE TEXAS OIL PRODUCERS CHANGE THE CHEMICAL MAKEUP OF THEIR PETROLEUM PRODUCTS!!

I RARELY PULL ANYTHING WITH THE TRUCK.  RARELY HAS THE TRUCK CARRIED HEAVY LOADS.    RECENTLY I NOTICED THAT THE VEHICLE WOULD VIBRATE VIOLENTLY WHEN I APPLIED THE BREAKS.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER TO HAVE IT CHECKED. I WAS INFORMED THAT ALL 4 ROTORS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED FOR A COST OF NEARLY $1,200 DOLLARS.  I HAVE NEVER EVEN HAD TO REPLACE A PAD ON THE BRAKE SYSTEM - THE PART THAT SHOULD WEAR OUT.  THE DEALER AND THE MANUFACTURE JUST SAY THAT IT IS A MAINTENANCE ITEM AND DENY A PROBLEM EXISTS.    MY 10 YEAR OLD CAR HAS 85,000 MILESAND JUST RECENTLY HAD THE PADS REPLACED AND THE ROTORS TURNED FOR THE FIRST TIME.  IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS NOT A DRIVING HABIT RELATED PROBLEM.      AS I LOOK AT CONSUMER INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET, I FIND THAT I AM NOT ALONE WITH THIS SORT OF PROBLEM.  THIS IS A FACTORY DEFECT THAT CAN CAUSE DEATH AND OR INJURY. I AM CURRENTLY AFRAID TO DRIVE THE TRUCK UNTIL SOMETHING IS DONE.",

THIS LASTED FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS, AND THE TRUCK TOOK A COUPLE OF EXTRA FEET TO STOP. I HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM ON MY 1998 CHEVY LUMINA SEVERAL MONTHS AGO AND THE ABS WARNING LIGHT CAME ON. THAT PROBLEM COST OVER $ 500 TO REPAIR. THE LUMINA HAD 49K MILES, BUT THE TRUCK ONLY HAS 18.5K MILES. THE ONLY THING IN COMMON WITH THESE TWO VEHICLES IS THAT I SWITCH OFF ON DRIVING THEM, SOMETIMES LETTING ONE OR THE OTHER STAY PARKED FOR A WEEK OR TWO, DEPENDING ON WHAT KIND OF WORK I AM DOING. THIS TIME, WITH THE SILVERADO, NO ABS OR BRAKE WARNING LIGHTS EVER CAME ON, SO I ASSUMED THAT THE SYSTEM HAD JUST DETECTED SOME MINOR SLIDING OF ONE OF THE WHEELS AS I WAS COMING TO A STOP, POSSIBLY FROM SOME LOOSE GRAVEL OR ROCKS. LATER THAT DAY, I DECIDED TO STOP AT THE LOCAL HOME DEPOT, ON MY WAY HOME FROM WORK. WHEN I PULLED INTO A PARKING SPOT, I PUSHED ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AND COULD HEAR THE ABS PUMP (?) WORKING VERY HARD. THE BRAKE PEDAL WOULD NOT MOVE AT ALL, AND THE BRAKE SYSTEM DID NOT SEEM TO BE STOPPING ANY OF THE WHEELS. I ONLY HAD A FRACTION OF A SECOND TO REACT, SO I THREW THE TRANSMISSION INTO REVERSE. THIS STOPPED THE FORWARD MOTION OF THE TRUCK, AND I PUT IT INTO PARK, BEFORE IT COULD MOVE ANY MORE. I ENDED UP STOPPED ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE REAR BUMPER OF THE CAR IN THE SPACE AHEAD OF ME. IF A PEDESTRIAN HAD RUN OUT IN FRONT OF ME EARLIER, AND I HAD BEEN UNABLE TO STOP, THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN KILLED.  THROUGH ALL THIS, NONE OF THE ABS, BRAKE, OR CHECK ENGINE WARNING LIGHTS EVER CAME ON. I DO NOT THINK THAT A VEHICLE WITH THIS LOW MILEAGE SHOULD HAVE SUCH A POTENTIALLY FATAL PROBLEM, AND THE ABS COMPONENTS SHOULD NOT CORRODE, AS THEY DID IN THE LUMINA, AND POSSIBLY IN THE SILVERADO, IF THE VEHICLE IS NOT DRIVEN REGULARLY.

AFTER LOWERING THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE GROUND, I PERFORMED A TEST.  I WAS ON A FLAT SURFACE, PUT THE VEHICLE IN NEUTRAL, ENGAGED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, AND TRIED TO MOVE THE VEHICLE BY MYSELF.  I WAS ABLE TO MOVE THE VEHICLE WITH EASE.  THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ALSO GOES ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR WITH NO RESISTANCE AND HAS NO EFFECT ON THE BRAKES.  I VISITED WWW.NHTSA.DOT.GOV AND NOTICED THAT A RECALL HAS BEEN PLACED ON THE EMERGENCY BRAKE SYSTEM ON VEHICLES WITH MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS (NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER : 05V161000).  I CALL CHEVROLET AND VOICED MY CONCERN OVER MY VEHICLE NOT HAVING RESISTANCE AT THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, THEY STATED THAT SINCE MY VEHICLE WAS NOT A MANUAL TRANSMISSION, THAT I WAS NOT A PART OF THE RECALL.  QUESTION TO NHTSA, HOW DOES THE TYPE OF TRANSMISSION EFFECT THE EMERGENCY BRAKE WHICH IS SUPPOSE TO BE A MECHANICAL DEVICE THAT OPERATES ON ITS OWN?  I HAVE BEEN TO MANY FORUMS WHERE NUMEROUS PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED PROBLEMS WITH THEIR EMERGENCY BRAKES.  I HAVE EVEN PRINTED A TECHNICAL DOCUMENT FROM CHEVROLET THAT DESCRIBES TO THE TECHNICIAN TO INSTALL THE SAME RETAINING CLIP TO EMERGENCY BRAKE JOBS THAT IS USED IN THE RECALL FOR MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS.  THIS IS A PROBLEM AND COULD LEAD TO NUMEROUS CRASHES, THE EMERGENCY BRAKE IS JUST THAT...A PERSON RELIES ON THE EMERGENCY BRAKE IN EMERGENCIES AND WITHOUT THE BRAKE DOING ITS JOB, PEOPLE WILL SUSTAIN INJURIES AND EVEN DIE WITHOUT THIS PROBLEM BEING FIXED IMMEDIATELY.",

THE FAILURE WAS IN A PARKING LOT AT SLOW SPEED.  I HAD THE SAME TYPE OF FAILURE ON AUG 3,2004.  I REPORTED IT TO THE NHTSA AT THAT TIME.  LAST AUG GM OK'D A WARRANTY FIX BY USING  SERVICE BULLT. # 02-05-006A-(NOV 26,2002).  AT THAT TIME THERE WAS DAMAGE TO THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE DUE TO RUNNING INTO A FENCE.  AFTER COMPLAINING, THEY AGREED TO PAY FOR FIXING THE DAMAGE.   NOW BACK TO THE PRESENT FAILURE.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID THE PROBLEM THIS TIME WAS THE WHEEL HUB ASSEMBLIES WHICH THE ABS SENSORS ARE ATTACHED.  CONTACTING GM, I TOLD THEM I BELIEVED THE REPAIR SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY EVEN THOUGH MY MILEAGE WAS 36,500.  THEY SAID IT WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY BECAUSE IT WAS 3 MONTHS AND 500 MILES OVER THE WARRANTY. I DID NOT AGREE WITH THEM AS I SEE THIS AS A CONTINUATION OF LAST AUGUST'S PROBLEM AND THAT IT WASN'T FIXED CORRECTLY AT THAT TIME. I HAD THE TRUCK FIXED AND PAID THE $631 MYSELF.  I AM CONTACTING YOU BECAUSE I BELIEVE THERE IS AN ABS BRAKE PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLE THAT IS NOT PECULIAR TO MY VEHICLE BUT NO DOUBT IS WIDESPREAD.

WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE I WAS PRETTY MUCH LED INTO BUYING THE \"EXTENDED WARRANTY\" FOR MY TRUCK WHICH THEY SAID WOULD COVER ANYTHING THAT WAS TO HAPPEN, ALL I WOULD HAVE TO PAY IS MY DEDUCTIBLE. IN JUNE OF 2004 AFTER DRIVING TO FT. MYERS TO VISIT FRIENDS, MY ENGINE STALLED, LOST OIL PRESSURE AND THE WARNING LIGHTS WENT OFF. NOT WANTING TO HARM THE ENGINE I BRAKED AND TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF. WITH ME WERE WITNESSES; MY MOM WHO IS A DISABLED, PARAPALYGIC, AND MY BROTHER AND SISTER. I CALLED THE CHEVROLET HELP LINE AND THEY HAD NO RECORD OF MY WARRANTY ON FILE AND WERE NOT WILLING TO HELP ME GET A TOW TRUCK THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED. I ENDED UP HAVING A FRIEND CALL AND GET MY VEHICLE TOWED THROUGH THEIR AAA TO MY HOME. I FINALLY ARRIVED HOME AT 1:30 AM! THE NEXT DAY I HAD IT TOWED TO REGISTER CHEVROLET AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD LOOK AT IT AND LET ME KNOW. REMEMEBER, I WAS TOLD THAT ANYTHING WOULD BE COVERED SO I WAS AT EASE KNOWING IT WOULD BE FIXED AND I WOULDNT HAVE A HUGE BILL. BOY WAS I WRONG THERE. WHEN THEY FINALLY DID GET ALONG TO CALLING ME THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD BE $207. THEY SAID IT WASNT A WARRANTY ITEM AND SO THEY WOULD NOT REIMBURSE ME FOR TOWING AS WELL AS REPAIRS! OK, ALL THEY DID WAS RE-ROUTE THE AC RUN OFF, WHICH BECAUSE IT WAS DESIGNED POORLY HAD ROTTED THE DISTRIBUTOR CAP. THIS IS WHAT I WAS TOLD AND IT WAS WRITTEN ON THE BILL I GOT. IF THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME I AM SURE THAT IT HAS HAPPENED TO OTHERS, SO I EVEN IF IT WAS NOT COVERED BY THEIR WARRANTY I DO BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE A RECALL ITEM. ALL I WANT IS THE DIFFERENCE BACK AS WELL AS THE TOWING CHARGES PAID. I HAVE ALL RECIEPTS FOR THIS MATTER. THANK YOU!*AK",

THEY DID THE WORK THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE 3 WEEKS EARLIER. WHEN I WENT TO THE FIRST DEALER ABOUT BEING REIMBURSED FOR WORK THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONE I GOT BLOWN OFF.

IT IS LAW THAT YOU WEAR YOUR SEATBELT BUT THIS ONE IS NOT USEABLE. I HAVE COMPLAINED TO GM AND MY DEALERSHIP BUT AM TOLD THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE AND TO GET USE TO IT! ALL I WANT IS A SEATBELT THAT WORKS PROPERLY AND SAFELY. PLEASE HELP.*AK",

WHILE I WAS CAPABLE OF MANUVERING MY VEICHLE OFF THE FREEWAY, THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM, THAT FROM REVIEWING TIRERACK.COM AND OTHER COMPLAINTS ON NHTSA'S WEB SITE APPEARS TO BE A COMMON OCCURANCE WITH THESE TIRES. I AM GOING TO SEE IF THE DEALER WILL ALLOW ME TO EXCHANGE MY TIRES WITH SIMILAR PRICED ONES FROM A DIFFERANT MANUFACTURE, THESE TIRES ARE UNSAFE AND I DO NOT TRUST MY LIFE OR ANYONE ELSES LIFE ON THEM.",
