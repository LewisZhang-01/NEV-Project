I CONTACTED THE LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP, I BROUGHT MY CAR IN TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT. THEY DIAGNOSED THE STEERING SENSOR NEEDED REPLACED, SO THEY ORDERED THE PART AND INSTALLED THE NEW SENSOR. THE DEALERSHIP NOTIFIED ME THAT THE SENSOR WAS NOT THE ISSUE, AND THAT I ACTUALLY NEED TO REPLACE THE STEERING COLUMN AND HOUSING UNIT. I WAS ORIGINALLY QUOTED FOR THE SENSOR & LABOR $779, WHICH THEY WERE NOT GOING TO CHARGE ME FOR SINCE IT WAS AN INCORRECT DIAGNOSIS. BUT, TO REPLACE THE STEERING COLUMN & HOUSING I WAS NOW QUOTED $2100.00. I HAD NOTICED ON WEB SITE SEARCHES THAT THERE IS RECALLS FOR STEERING ISSUES ON 2008 MERCURY MARINER. I ENTERED MY VIN NUMBER AND NOTHING IS COMING UP, I ALSO QUESTIONED THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT READING THE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS AND ALSO ASKED ABOUT IF THERE WERE ANY RECALLS FOR MY VEHICLE, I WAS TOLD THERE WERE NONE. I JUST  CAN'T FATHOM MY ISSUE HAS GONE FROM $779 TO $2100 ON A SENSOR ISSUE TO A REPLACEMENT OF THE STEERING COLUMN AND HOUSING. I'M HOPING FOR SOME RESULTS BY SUBMITTING THIS COMPLAINT. THANK YOU",

THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULDN'T KNOW IF IT IS RELATED OR NOT UNTIL THEY RUN A DIAGNOSTIC. LATER THAT NEXT DAY THEY CALL AND SAID THAT IT IS NOT RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE THAT WAS REPLACE, WHICH I DISAGREE, AND THEY QUOTED ME A LARGE AMOUNT TO FIX. I TOLD THEM THAT IT IS FORD RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE I FEEL THAT IT WAS RELATED TO THE RECALL. I COULD HAD DIED AND MY GREAT NIECE AS WELL. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD COST AT LEAST $545 FOR JUST THE SENSOR BUT THAT THE WHOLE STEERING COLUMN WOULD NEED REPLACING SO IT WOULD BE A LOT MORE THAN THAT TO FIX. I WAS UNABLE TO AFFORD A REPAIR, I SIMPLY STAYED ON MY GUARD & WOULD JUST PULL OVER & RE-START THE CAR SO THAT I COULD DRIVE AGAIN SAFELY. THEN I GOT NOTICE OF A RECALL SO I TOOK IT IN & TOLD THEM THAT I HAD ISSUES WITH THE STEERING & WAS VERY GLAD THAT THERE WAS FINALLY A RECALL. THEN 2 MOS LATER, THE STEERING WENT OUT AGAIN & THIS TIME IT IS WORSE THAN BEFORE. I CAN NO LONGER TURN THE CAR OFF & RE-START IT TO GET STEERING, IT IS SIMPLY GONE OUT COMPLETELY & IT HARDER TO TURN THAN EVER. THE STEERING WHEEL ACTUALLY TRIES TO TURN THE OPPOSITE WAY THAT THE DIRECTION THAT I AM TURNING. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP & THEY TOLD ME THAT THIS HAPPENED TO ANOTHER PERSON & FORD WOULD NOT COVER IT AND TOLD ME THAT ALL THEY DID WAS RE-PROGRAM THE CAR. AFTER RESEARCHING THE RECALL, I FOUND THAT IF THE CAR SHOWS HISTORY OF A LOSS OF THE TORQUE SENSOR, THAT THE TORQUE SENSOR WAS TO BE REPLACED. I THEN CALLED FORD CUSTOMER CARE & THE LADY THERE WAS VERY COLD & SIMPLY STATED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY WOULD DO SINCE IT WAS ALREADY FIXED ONCE. I TOLD HER THAT IT WAS NOT REPAIRED CORRECTLY BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS ISSUES WITH IT, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED. SHE TOLD ME TO TAKE IT UP WITH THE DEALER THAT I TOOK IT TO. I NOW HAVE NECK PROBLEMS DUE TO DRIVING MY UNSAFE CAR THAT I HAVE NO MONEY TO REPAIR & AM STILL MAKING PAYMENTS ON.
