HAVE BEEN TO THE DEALER SEVEN TIMES STARTING AUGUST 2013.    THE DEALER HAS REPLACED THE FAN AND FILTER, FOUND BLOWER MOTOR WEAKENED, SEIZED. REMOVED AND REPLACED BLOWER, SWAPPED SEAT WITH ANOTHER CAR IN STOCK/LOANER, FOUND DRIVER SEAT BOTTOM DEFORMED; REMOVED AND REPLACED DRIVER SEAT BOTTOM, AND HAVE, WITHOUT HYUNDAI'S APPROVAL, INSERTED A \"HOSE\" TUBE UNDER THE SEAT TO IMPROVE AIRFLOW. I HAVE ALSO HAD TWO DIFFERENT FIELD SERVICE REPS SPEND A DAY, MONTH APART, WITH THE CAR - TESTING AND MEASURING VOLTAGE AND CURRENT TO THE MOTOR. THE FIRST FIELD SERVICE REP AGREED THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM AND REQUESTED \"DOCUMENTATION\" FROM HYUNDAI-KOREA, BUT NEVER RECEIVED ANY. THAT REP WAS TRANSFERRED OUT, AND THE NEW FIELD REP DID NOT FIND ANY PROBLEM. AFTER THIS, THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DIRECTOR TRIED TO HELP ME BY INSTALLING A SMALL \"HOSE\" TUBE JUST OVER THE AIR-INTAKE OPENING, BUT THAT STILL DID NOT IMPROVE ANYTHING.    RIGHT NOW, AT MAX SETTING OF THE SWITCH, I STILL FEEL NO AIR COMING FROM ANY OF THE VENTED HOLES - ON THE SEAT AND ON THE BACK! I HAVE FILED THE DEFECT NOTIFICATION FORM WITH THE HYUNDAI AT THEIR CONSUMER CONNECT CENTER ADDRESS IN CALIFORNIA, AND SENT A COPY TO THE FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE FOR THE LEMON LAW ADMINISTRATION.

ON 10TH APRIL, I HEARD GRINDING NOISE FROM THE REAR RIGHT TIRE. I TOOK IT TO OTHER HYUNDAI AGAIN. BELOW IS THE REPORT THAT THEY GAVE ME AND I WAS STUNNED. \"TECHNICIAN FOUND THAT THE REAR RIGHT STRUT HAD SNAP FROM BOLD ON FRAME, ONE BOLT MISSING PRIOR AND ALSO FOUND GREEN DUCT TAPE THAT WAS HOLDING THE STRUT TO THE CAR. CUSTOMER ADVISED VEHICLE IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE. IF VEHICLE IS DRIVEN THERE IS A HIGH POSSIBILITY OF THE STRUT FALLING OFF WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS AND AN ACCIDENT WILL RESULT.\" THERE WAS A GREEN DUCT TAPE SUPPORTING THE CAR. AFTER THIS REPORT, FOR ME IT IS PROVED THAT THIS CAR MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN A MAJOR ACCIDENT BEFORE I PURCHASED IT AND THE ISSUE HAS BEEN FIXED WITHOUT REPORTING IT. EVEN THE MECHANIC WHO SHOWED ME THE PROBLEM WITH THE CAR WAS SHOCKED. AFTER I GOT THE REPORT, I TOOK IT TO BROWN'S HYUNDAI MANASSAS AND TALKED WITH SERVICE MANAGER, HE TOTALLY IGNORED ME. OTHER SALES ASSOCIATES TOLD ME THEY ARE UNKNOWN WITH THIS ISSUE AND THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING FURTHER TO HELP ME. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE DISLOYAL BEHAVIOR FROM A HYUNDAI EMPLOYEE. AS MECHANIC SAID, I COULD HAVE GOT INTO A MAJOR ACCIDENT. MY CONCERN IS MY FAMILY. I HAVE A TWO-YEAR-OLD NIECE WHO TRAVELS WITH ME OFTEN IN THE CAR. I AM ALSO CONCERNED THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN DOING THIS BEHAVIOR TO OTHER CONSUMER AS WELL AND PUTTING LIFE IN DANGER. MY CAR IS STILL IN THE FAIRFAX HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP.   *TR",

I TRUSTED THAT IT WILL BE FIXED PERMANENTLY BUT TO FIND OUT THAT 2 MONTHS LATER I HAD TO EXPERIENCE DEATHLY RE OCCURRENCE. I WAS SO PETRIFIED AND DID NOT WANT TO DRIVE THAT CAR AGAIN SO I REQUESTED TO EXCHANGE TO ANOTHER CAR. MY HUSBAND DID ALL OF THE TRANSACTIONS FOR THE NEW CAR.   FEW DAYS LATER, PAPER WORK ARRIVED, THE SALESMAN CAME TO MY WORK DURING BUSY TIME SO I DIDN'T HAVE CHANCE TO READ IN DETAILS.WELL THE PAPER WORK READ THAT MY NEW CAR WAS 2013 INSTEAD OF 2014.
