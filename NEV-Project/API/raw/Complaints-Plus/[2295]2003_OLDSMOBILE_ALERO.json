COAST OUT OF THE CANYON WITH THE ENGINE OFF. TURN ENGINE ON AFTER SEVERAL MILES AND NO MORE PROBLEMS. DRIVE HOME CAREFULLY. NEXT DAY THROWS SEVERAL CODES AND RUNNING SLUGGISH.  SEVERAL DAYS LATER CODES ARE GONE RIGHT BEFORE IT GOES TO DEALER. THEY CAN'T DIAGNOSE IF CAR HAS NO ACTIVE CODES OR SYMPTOMS.

I LEFT THE CAR AND THEY SAY THEY CAN'T REPLICATE THE ISSUE. LITERALLY THE SAME DAY I PICK THE CAR UP IT IS KNOCKING AND CONSISTENTLY DOES SO FOR THE NEXT WEEK AS SOON AS THE ENGINE WARMS UP.  JULY 5  ENGINE SOUNDS LIKE IT'S BEING HIT BY A HAMMER AND THROWS P0011 CAM TIMING ADVANCED. OIL PRESSURE IS 5PSI AT IDLE AND 40PSI AT 5000RPM. HAVE CAR TOWED TO DEALER BECAUSE IT PROBABLY WOULDN'T MAKE THE DRIVE AND THEY SAY IT IS PISTON SLAP WITHOUT EVEN OPENING THE ENGINE THEY DETERMINE IT IS NOT CAUSED BY THE RECALL. AT THIS POINT THE ENGINE IS SITTING IN MY GARAGE WITH THE TIMING COVER, OIL PAN AND ONE VALVE COVER OFF AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT. I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THEM TO FIX SOMETHING THAT IS HAPPENING TO DOZENS OF PEOPLE AFTER THE RECALL.  I'M GOING TO TRY TO GET THE DEALER TO ACTUALLY TEAR IT DOWN TO DIAGNOSE IT..

THERE WAS HEAVY TRAFFIC ON THE ROAD, AND I WAS GOING TO NEED SOMEONE TO LET ME INTO THE LANE. MY TURN SIGNAL, HOWEVER, MALFUNCTIONED AND WOULD NOT ILLUMINATE.

THE MALFUNCTIONING OF THE TURN SIGNALS OCCURS MOST OFTEN DURING WET OR HUMID CONDITIONS. ONLY RECENTLY DID I DISCOVER THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM. WHEN I ATTEMPT TO ACTIVATE THE TURN SIGNAL AND IT MALFUNCTIONS, IT CAN OFTENTIMES BE REMEDIED BY APPLYING A SMALL AMOUNT OF PRESSURE TO THE HAZARD LIGHT BUTTON. IT WAS ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO THAT I ENCOUNTERED AN EXISTING RECALL FOR EARLIER MODELS OF MY CAR. THE HAZARD LIGHT BUTTON HAS BEEN RECALLED ON THE PREVIOUS TWO MODEL YEARS (2001-2002) OF THE OLDSMOBILE ALERO. IT CAN NOT BE A COINCIDENCE THAT THE SAME PROBLEM IS OCCURRING IN MY VEHICLE.     I LOOKED INTO GETTING THE BUTTON REPLACED, BUT THE LABOR COSTS MAKE REPLACEMENT AN EXPENSIVE OPTION. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR A SYSTEMIC DEFECT THAT EGREGIOUSLY AFFECTS THE FUNCTIONALITY AND SAFETY OF MY VEHICLE.

THE  \"CLICK\" NOISE SPEED VARIES, SOMETIMES EVERY SECOND, OTHER TIMES IT  \"CLICKS\" AS IF IN A FRENZY \"CLICK-A-CLICK-A-CLICK-A-CLICK-A...\" AND SO ON.    WHEN BLICKER ACTUALLY IS PUT TO USE BY DRIVER, SOMETIMES IT OPERATES AS A BLINKER SHOULD, IE, STAYING ON UNTIL EITHER THE TURN IS MADE OR THE DRIVER MANUALLY RETURNS THE BLINKER INDICATOR BACK TO IT'S STANDARD POSITION, OTHER TIMES IT WILL TURN ITSELF OFF PREMATURELY, IE, WHILE THE DRIVER IS STILL WAITING TO TURN, BEFORE STEERING WHEEL IS TURNED - AND BLINKER INDICATOR REMAINS IN THE \"IN USE\" POSITION...BLINKING LIGHTS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE JUST STOP WORKING AS IF THE DRIVER TURNED THE BLINKER OFF HIM/HERSELF.  OTHER TIMES WHEN BLINKER IS USED, NOTHING HAPPENS.  NO BLINKER INDICATOR LIGHTS APPEAR ON OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE TO INDICATE TO OTHER DRIVERS THAT A TURN/LANE CHANGE IS ATTEMPTING TO BE MADE.    ACCORDING TO OLDSMOBILE CUSTOMER SERVICE ON 9/1/10, THERE IS NO RECALL FOR THIS DEFECT FOR THE 2003 ALERO, ALTHOUGH OTHER LATE MODEL ALEROS HAVE HAD A RECALL ISSUED FOR THIS SAME DEFECT.  SEE: NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER: 03V327000.      THE ONLY OPTION AT THIS POINT FOR 2003 ALERO OWNERS TO PREVENT THEIR VEHICLE FROM BEING A ROAD HAZARD IS TO HAVE A DEALERSHIP FIX THE MANUFACTURER DEFECT AT A COST OF $120-$200 OUT OF POCKET, EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A KNOWN AND COMMON ISSUE ON LATE MODEL ALEROS....OR WAIT AROUND FOR OLDSMOBILE TO ISSUE A RECALL FOR A VEHICLE 7+ YRS OLD AT THIS POINT AND FIX FOR FREE AS THEY SHOULD. *TR",
