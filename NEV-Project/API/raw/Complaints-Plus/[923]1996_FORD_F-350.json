THERE ARE OTHER VEHICLES OUT THERE ON THE ROAD (SUCH AS MINE) THAT HAVE A SIMILAR POTENTIAL TO FAIL. THIS IS A DIFFICULT PROBLEM TO DIAGNOSE; THE DEALER COULD NOT DETERMINE THE PROBLEM THE FIRST TIME I BROUGHT IT IN (JANUARY 2007). MY PROBLEM WENT ON FOR MORE THAN A YEAR (WITH MOMENTARY POWER LOSSES AND ENGINE STALLS SHORTLY AFTER STARTUP) BEFORE IT PROGRESSED TO SERIOUS DRIVABLE ISSUES THAT WERE FREQUENT ENOUGH THEY COULD BE DIAGNOSED BY THE FORD DEALER. CAMSHAFT SENSOR FAILURE CAUSES THE ENGINE COMPUTER TO MAKE THE ENGINE STALL. UNFORTUNATELY, AT THAT STAGE THE DRIVABLE ISSUES ALSO BECOME DANGEROUS.
