AT THE END OF NOVEMBER 2012 I WAS ALMOST IN AN ACCIDENT WHILE MAKING A LEFT TURN, THE BIKE COUGHED THROUGH THE THROTTLE BODIES AND DIED. AN ON COMING CAR ALMOST HIT ME. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER IN MY AREA AS OPPOSED TO THE DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM BECAUSE THEY WERE OUT OF BUSINESS. MY LOCAL DEALER ASKED ME WHAT I WANTED THEM TO DO, AND I DISCUSSED MY PROBLEM AND THEY PUT IT ON THE COMPUTER WHICH TOLD THEM THEY COULDN'T ADJUST THE ECM BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE AN AUTHORIZATION CARD THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO ME AT TIME PURCHASE. I ASKED THEM IF THEY COULD GET THE CARD AND THEY TOLD ME TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER THAT I BOUGHT IT FROM. ANYWAY THEY COULDN'T OR WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I CALLED  VICTORY AND THEIR ON;Y ANSWER WAS \"TAKE IT TO A DEALER\" I TOLD THEM I NO LONGER HAD A DEALER AS THE ONE I BOUGHT IT FROM WAS OUT OF BUSINESS AND MY LOCAL ONE HAD DROPPED THE VICTORY LINE DUE TO HORRIBLE CUSTOMER AND DEALER SERVICES. FINALLY FOUND A DEALER THAT WOULD GET THE CARD AND RE-FLASH THE ECM, THE DEALER WAS ALMOST 100 MILES FROM MY HOME. THEY DID THE WORK, WHICH I WAS THANKFUL FOR BUT I STILL HAD THE PROBLEM. AFTER MANY ATTEMPTS TO GET THE BIKE REPAIRED BY VICTORY I TOOK IT TO AN INDEPENDENT SHOP AND THEY MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS THAT HELPED BUT WITHOUT THE SOFTWARE THEY COULDN'T DO MUCH. THE BIKE IF SOMEWHAT BETTER BUT IT STILL IS NOT RIGHT!!! I SPENT $23,000 ON THIS MACHINE AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT THIS WAY AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO FILE A COMPLAINT BUT VICTORY REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS AND POSSIBLE SEVERE INJURY OR DEATH MECHANICAL PROBLEM.  *TR",
