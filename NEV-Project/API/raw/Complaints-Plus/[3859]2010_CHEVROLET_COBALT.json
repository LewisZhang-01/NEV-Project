When we went out to the garage we smelled strong gas fumes which we thought was odd as our garage never smelled of strong gas fumes in the past. We got in the Cobalt & turned the key & it didn't start right away, it took a little bit for it to turn over which I thought was odd as we haven't experienced that before.  We put the windows down as the inside of the car had a strong gas smell. There was no warning lights on the dashboard & no prior warning before this issue. Returned home parked car in garage, went back into garage & noticed even stronger smell of gas, looked under the car & noticed liquid under back driver side door which was gas dripping down onto the garage floor, I was nervous of the fumes collecting in the garage & potential fire hazard I put the car outside & placed a bucket under the car to catch the gas to stop it from dripping on the driveway. Also noticed the silver heat shield material was spongy feeling had liquid feel to it which I assume is gas as it was dripping right next to it? Looked on Google noticed other consumers having the same issue of gas dripping from the fuel line. Going to call a Chevy dealer to see what options are as I don't feel safe driving the car knowing its dripping gas & potentially collecting in the silver heat shield material. Chevy should issue a recall to repair the issue & prevent future safety hazard waiting to happen.",

I WAS ALSO INFORMED BY GM HQ, WHEN I TALKED TO THEM A FOURTH TIME, THAT THEY WERE NOT SURE WHICH COBALTS 2010 HAD EPS PROBLEM, THAT DOES NOT REFLECT THE ANSWERS I RECEIVED ON THREE OTHER OCCASIONS FROM GM HQ'S EXECUTIVE OFFICE.  MY DEALERS SYSTEM DOES NOT REFLECT SAME RECALLS THEN GM'S.  I WAS TOLD THAT \"THE DEALERS GOT THE MEMOS AND HAD PROBABLY NOT GOT TO THEM TO READ THEM YET.\" I SAW WHAT WAS ON THEIR COMPUTER.  GM IS NOT BEING TRUTHFUL AND I AM STARTING TO SUSPECT THAT THEY USED ANOTHER PART WITH THE SAME PART NUMBER WITH THE EPS PROBLEM AND THEREFORE THEY CAN NOT DETERMINE WHICH COBALT IS AFFECTED.  GM IS NOT BEING TRUTHFUL AND IS BEING NEGLIGENT IN INFORMING THE DEALERS AND THE VEHICLE OWNERS ( I HAVE NOT GOTTEN ANY RECALL NOTICES IN THE MAIL).  BREACH OF CONTRACT. SOLD FAULTY VEHICLE TO ME WITH KNOWLEDGE OF FAULTY PART(S) ON MAY 29, 2010.   *JS",

I WAS GLAD TO BE SLOWING TO STOP AS THE WHEEL WOULD NOT TURN.   I TURNED OFF MY ENGINE AND WENT INSIDE WORK. AFTER 10 MINUTES I CAME BACK OUTSIDE TO LOOK AT THE MANUAL TO SEE WHERE THE POWER STEERING FLUID CONTAINER WAS INSIDE THE HOOD AND START THE CAR AGAIN. THE POWER STEERING PROBLEM WAS GONE. AND I POPPED THE HOOD AND DID NOT SEE A FLUID CONTAINER FOR THE PS.   I CALLED THE DEALER AS MY CAR IS TWO YEARS OLD BUT I HAD JUST PURCHASED IT TWO MONTHS AGO AND HAD ONLY PUT ON LESS THAN 1,500 MILES. I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT FOR ME TODAY (ONE DAY AFTER THE INCIDENT). THE TECH WHO CHECKED ME IN, TOLD ME THAT THERE IS NO PS FLUID CONTAINER TO FILL, AS IT IS ALL MOTOR/ELECTRONIC DRIVEN. HE SAID THEY WOULD LOOK IT OVER AND LET ME KNOW. I DID PURCHASE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THIS VEHICLE AND THE VEHICLE CAME WITH A TWO YEAR CERTIFIED USED WARRANTY AS WELL.   THE MECHANIC SAID IT WAS THE POWER STEERING ASSIST MOTOR AND THAT THEY WOULD BE REPLACING IT AT NO CHARGE AS I HAD THE WARRANTY.   THE PAPERWORK STATES THEY PUT A REBUILT PS ASSIST MOTOR INTO MY 2010 COBALT.   NOW AFTER BEING ONLINE AND READING MULTIPLE YEARS OF REVIEWS REGARDING 2005, 2006 & 2007 COBALT'S, I AM WONDERING WHERE DOES IT END? HOW MANY MORE YEARS WORTH OF CARS ARE HAVING THESE PROBLEMS? WHY HAS A RECALL NOT BEEN DONE ON ANY OF THESE YEARS CARS?   I DRIVE MY CAR ON LONG FAMILY TRIPS AS WELL AS MANY WORK TRIPS, WHICH IS WHY I GOT IT IN THE FIRST PLACE TO COMBAT THE HIGHER GAS PRICES AND GET BETTER FUEL EFFICIENCY. BUT GETTING INTO A CRASH WHILE I AM ON THE ROAD, IF THIS PROBLEM OCCURS AGAIN, NEGATES ALL OF THAT.   PLEASE DO SOMETHING!  *TR  UPDATED 08/29/12*L'S",

ALL SENSORS OF THE DOORS DIDN'T WORK UNTIL THE DOOR WAS OPENED OVER 5 INCHES.      I VISITED A DEALER SHOP, AND ASKED TO FIX IT. A SALES PERSON KNEW THAT ALL COBALT LTS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AFTER CHECKING OTHER VEHICLES. ALSO, ALL TECHNICIANS HAD NOT KNOWN THE PROBLEM UNTIL MY CLAIM.      AFTER SEARCHING, A TECHNICIAN SAID TO ME ?IT CAN?T FIXED, USUALLY OTHER VEHICLES ARE INSTALLED TWO SENSORS EACH DOOR, BUT THE COBALT HAS ONLY ONE.?      ABOUT 10 DAYS LATER, SERVICE MANAGER HAD TRIED TO ADJUST ALL SENSORS AND TOLD ME \"IT IS FIXED PERMANENTLY.\" BUT 2 WEEKS LATER, DRIVER'S SIDE SENSOR CAME OUT FROM THE VEHICLE, FROM TIME TO TIME THE DOOR AJAR SIGN SHOWS UP ON THE DASH BOARD WITH DING! DING! SOUNDS. EVEN THOUGH ALL DOORS ARE CLOSED COMPLETELY, IT'S A VERY FUNNY CAR!      I VISITED G.M. DEALER SHOP AGAIN. THEY TRIED TO REPLACE THE SENSOR, DIDN'T, BECAUSE I WANT TO FIX IT THE PROPER WAY, NOT A TEMPORARY NOR TRICKY WAY.      MY WIFE AND I DROVE ON THE HIGHWAY WHILE A REAR DOOR WAS AJAR WITHOUT ANY WARNING. ALSO SOMETIMES MY SUNDAY SCHOOL KIDS HAVE TO USE MY CAR COME TO CHURCH. THEREFORE COBALT?S PROBLEM IS VERY SERIOUS FOR ALL OUR SAFETY. ESPECIALLY WHO LIVES WITH KIDS.  I KNOW THAT MY MISTAKE IS BUYING A GM CAR, BUT I'M TRYING TO MINIMIZE IT.       I KNOW, G. M. COBALT HAS ANOTHER PROBLEM REGARDING POWER STEERING, ALSO DOOR AJAR SENSOR HAS SERIOUS POTENTIAL PROBLEM. PLEASE INVESTIGATE IT CAREFULLY FOR SAFE DRIVING .THANK YOU.   *TR",

THE STEERING COLUMN WAS REPLACED AND THAT DID RESOLVE THE PULLING TO THE LEFT.  HOWEVER, WHEN I REACH 50ISH MPH AND THE COMPUTER PUTS THE STEERING INTO \"STIFF\" MODE THERE IS NO PLAY LEFT IN THE STEERING AND IT TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT FOR INPUT.  IT REQUIRES FULL ATTENTION TO KEEP THE CAR IN THE LANE AT  EXPRESSWAY SPEEDS, AND WORSE STILL IN WINDY CONDITIONS.  IN SHORT, AT EXPRESSWAY SPEEDS, THE STEERING IS TOO STIFF REQUIRING MUCH EFFORT, AND THERE IS NO \"PLAY\" IN THE STEERING SO THE CAR CONTINUALLY WANTS TO GO LEFT OR RIGHT, AND NOT \"TRACK\" STRAIGHT DOWN THE HIGHWAY, AS IT SHOULD.  I FIND THIS ANNOYING AND TIRESOME, AS I HAVE ARTHRITIS AND IT REQUIRES NEEDLESS EFFORT, AND EVEN THE JUNKIEST OLD WRECK SHOULD TRACK DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND STAY IN THE LANE WITHOUT MUCH INPUT.  I'VE CONTACTED EVERY DEPARTMENT AT GM TO FIND OUT IF THE STEERING CAN BE SET TO ALWAYS BE IN FULL-POWER ASSIST MODE AND NO ONE CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION, NOT EVEN THE HANDICAP/SPECIAL NEEDS DEPARTMENT.  GM WON'T PUT ME THROUGH TO THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT WHO COULD ACTUALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION, AND WOULD KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT. *TR",
