I WAS TOLD THAT THEY ONLY HAVE 4 RECALLS ON THE VAN TWO OF THE RECALLS HAVE BEEN COMPLETE BUT TO HAVE NOT. THE TWO RECALLS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE ARE: LIFTGATE LATCH PN CFXR6406 AND SEAT BELT BUCKLE/ANCH. CLIP. THE TWO RECALLS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DONE ARE: LIFTGATE SUPPORT WASHER AND A LEFT WIPER PIVOT.  I THEN EXPLAINED TO THE CHRYSLER CUSTOMER RELATION THAT THE RECORDS ON THEY WEB SITE ONLY SHOWS BACK TO 1996 PER THE WEB SITE INFORMATION. THEY SAID THAT ANY RECALL WOULD BE WITH THE VEHICLE FOR LIFE IN THE SYSTEM. I ALSO ASKED IF THEY HAD ANY INFORMATION ON THE ULTRADRIVE TRANSMISSIONS HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THE 1989 TO 1991 MODELS. THE PERSON SAID THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO LOOK THAT INFORMATION UP.  I THEN EXPLAINED THAT THE INFORMATION IS ON THE CENTER FOR AUTO SAFETY WEB SITE. THE CUSTOMER RELATION PERSON SAID THAT IF THE INFORMATION IS NOT ON THE CHRYSLER OR DODGE WEB SITES THEN THE INFORMATION IS NOT RIGHT. ALSO THE RELATIONS PERSON SAID THAT EVEN IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE ULTRADRIVE TRANSMISSION THAT IT IS NO LONGER COVERED UNDER THE MANUFACTURES WARRANTY ANYMORE.
