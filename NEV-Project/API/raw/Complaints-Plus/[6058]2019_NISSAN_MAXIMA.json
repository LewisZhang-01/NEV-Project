The secondary latch prevented the hood from rising more than a couple of inches so no damage occurred, but had the hood come completely open it could have been a disaster.  The car was pulled to the side of the road and the hood was closed tight.  The hood was last opened when being serviced by my Nissan dealer.  This is the first time this has happened and the car was driven home (approx 15 miles), under the same windy conditions, without incident.  It has not been inspected by the dealer yet.",
