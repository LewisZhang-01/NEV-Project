I FOUND THAT UNDER STANDARD 202 THAT ALL CARS, MULTIPASSENGER VEHICLES, TRUCKS, AND BUSES WITH A GVWR OF 10,000 LBS OR LESS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE HEAD RESTRAINTS EFFECTIVE 1-1-69. THIS SURPRISED ME THAT MY TRUCK ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS WERE PRODUCED WITHOUT HEADRESTRAINTS. IN FACT, THE BENCH SEAT IN MY TRUCK ONLY GOES UP TO THE LEVEL OF MY SHOULDER BLADES. I HAVE NOT CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY ON THIS ISSUE SINCE I WANTED TO RESEACH THIS SAFETY STANDARD TO MAKE CERTAIN IT APPLIES MY MY VEHICLE. I HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED A REPRESENTATIVE ON YOUR HOTLINE WHO TOLD ME TO FILL OUT THIS VOQ AND ALSO REFERED MY TO ANOTHER REP WHO THEN REFERED ME TO YOUR COMPLIANCE ENGINEER [XXX] WHO I SPOKE WITH AND EXPLAINED MY CASE. HE WAS VERY HELPFUL AND HAS REFERED THIS CASE TO A [XXX] DEFECT ENGINEER. I AM AWAITING HIS REPLY STILL AND I JUST WANTED TO ENTER THIS AS A MORE DETAILED EXPLAINATION OF MY COMPLAINT. WHAT INSTIGATED THIS WAS A STRING OF MULTIPLE INCIDENTS WHERE I WAS NEARLY REAR-ENDED AND GOT TO THINKING ABOUT THE DANGER OF NOT HAVING HEAD RESTRAINTS. NOW THAT I AM UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT MY TRUCK DOES NOT MEET FEDERAL SAFETY GUIDELINES I AM WANTING ACTION TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM AND I FELT THAT NHTSA WAS THE BEST ROUTE TO GET THE BALL MOVING.
