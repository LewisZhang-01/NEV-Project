One mechanic told me that it was not that big of a deal. I do not feel safe like this and I want the airbag replaced. I am going around in circled with this and Ford will not help me. I have called Ford corprate to no avail. I am very upset about this and am asking that they fix this problem. The tire keeps going flat as well due to a defect with their rims/tires. There was also an issue where the engine can catch fire however, the people from Ford do not seem to care. They do not have to drive this car, I do and I need to feel safe. This is a serious accident waiting to happen. I want these items to get fixed and not have people deny all of this. This is an open recall and they are giving me a hard time. I need help. I have been calling for four months now and cannot get help. Please help me fix this so I do not get injured in this car as well as any passangers, etc. Thank you.",

BUT THE SECOND TIME IT HAPPENED 7 DAYS AGO, IT LASTED LONGER AND UNFORTUNATELY I HAD MY 14 MONTH OLD IN THE CAR. I WAS PULING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE ONE LATE AFTERNOON AND PROCEEDED TO DRIVE FORWARD AND NOTICED THAT IT WAS REVING VERY LOUDLY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS BARELY MOVING. WHENEVER I WOULD COME TO A LIGHT AND STOP OR SLOW DOWN TO TURN AND THEN TRY TO INCREASE MY SPEED I NOTICED THAT IT WOULD BE REVING SO LOUDLY AND BARELY MOVING AT FIRST, BUT THEN AFTER ABOUT 10 SECONDS IT WOULD START TO MOVE A LITTLE FASTER - BUT NOT AS FAST AS IT USUALLY MOVES WHEN I PUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ON THE GAS PEDAL. I ALSO NOTICED ALONG THE WAY THAT MY SPEDOMETEER WAS NOT MOVING. IT WAS STUCK ON 0MPH THE WHOLE TIME. THEN ABOUT 5 MINUTES INTO THIS HORROR, THE WRENCH LIGHT CAME ON AND ALTHOUGHH I HAD MY SEATBELT ON AND I HAD NO FRONT PASSENGER, THE SETBELT LIGHT CAME ON TOO. I MANAGED TO PULL THE CAR OVER NEAR MY HOME AND MOVED INTO A SPACE IN FRONT OF A NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE. WHEN I WENT TO BACK UP AND CORRECT MY PARKING THE CAR MADE SUCH A LOUD CLUNK SOUND. I THEN TURNED OFF THE CAR AND RIGHT THEN A MESSAGE FLASHED ON THE DASH BOARD ABOUT 'CHECK TIRE PRESSURE' OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT MY TIRES WERE PERFECTLY AND PROPERLY INFLATED. THE FIRST INCIDENT SHOOK ME A LITTLE BUT IT WAS ONLY ME IN THE CAR AND I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE, (ALTHOUGH UNLIKELY), I MADE A MISTAKE AND WAS USING THE WRONG GEAR TO MANUVER. BUT AFTER THIS SECOND INCIDENT (ESPECIALLY WITH MY BABY IN THE CAR) I HAVE NOT TOUCHED THE CAR SINCE. I BOUGHT IT AS A FAMILY VEHICLE, AND IF IT COULD LEAD TO ME OR MY FAMILY BEING KILLED ON THE ROAD, THERE IS NO POINT. I THANK GOD THAT I AVOID HIGHWAYS BECAUSE I COULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I WAS ON A HIGHWAY WHEN THIS HAPPENED.",

AFTER THE PEDAL HAD BECOME EVEN SOFTER AND THE CAR BECAME HARDER TO STOP ALONG WITH LOUDER HISSING, I REALIZED THERE WAS A PROBLEM. I DON'T CONSIDER HAVING TO ALMOST STAND ON MY BRAKE PEDAL IN QUICK STOPPING SITUATIONS VERY NORMAL. I HAD THE VEHICLE LOOKED AT BY MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP SERVICE CENTER. THEY CONFIRMED THAT MY POWER BRAKE BOOSTER HAS A FAIRLY LARGE TEAR IN IT WHICH WILL ONLY GET WORSE AND EVENTUALLY FAIL UNEXPECTEDLY. I WAS TOLD THE COST TO REPLACE THIS BRAKE BOOSTER WAS ABOUT $1000 OR EVEN A LITTLE OVER. BEING A COLLEGE STUDENT WITH AN EXTREMELY TIGHT BUDGET, REPAIRING THIS IS OUT OF THE QUESTION. HAVING PREVIOUSLY PAID OUT-OF-POCKET FOR THE NUMEROUS OTHER REPAIRS ON THIS VEHICLE INCLUDING MULTIPLE PREMATURE IGNITION COIL FAILURES, BOTH MY SAVINGS AND PATIENCE WITH FORD HAVE DRIED UP. I HAVE CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY MULTIPLE TIMES ABOUT THIS ISSUE ONLY TO BE FED LIES TO LEAD ME ON UNTIL THEY CAN END THE CONVERSATION IN HOPES I WILL FORGET THE WHOLE THING. I AM FULLY AWARE THERE ARE MANY OTHER EDGE OWNERS FACING THIS SAME SITUATION OR EVEN WORSE AND I CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WHY NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE.

I PULLED TO THE SHOULDER TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF THEN BACK ON & IT WAS GOOD FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY- THIS HAPPENED MORE THAN ONCE SO I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO MY AUTHORIZED MECHANIC (OF OVER 17 YEARS) WITHIN A WEEK OF THAT INCIDENT & THEY REPLACED SOME COMPONENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSMISSION. THE CAR WORKED FINE FOR A LITTLE OVER 18 MONTHS.     2016 IT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN WITH THE SAME ISSUE SAME AS BEFORE IN MORNING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC EXCEPT WITH THE JERK & AUTO DEACCELERATION THERE WAS A LOUD *BUMP AS IF SOMEONE REAR-ENDED ME.  I PULLED OFF TO THE SHOULDER TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE THEN BACK ON & IT DID FINE FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES THEN IT HAPPENED A 2ND TIME SO AGAIN I PULL OFF TO THE SHOULDER TURN OFF THE VEHICLE THEN BACK ON & IT IS FINE-ALMOST AS IF THE VEHICLE RESETS WHEN YOUR TURN IT OFF THEN BACK ON. I TOOK THE CAR TO MY MECHANIC, THE OWNER IS WHO USUALLY DIAGNOSIS MY CAR IS ON VACATION OUT OF THE COUNTRY--UGH. AFTER EXPLAINING THE INCIDENT ONE MECHANIC TEST DRIVES IT FOR A COUPLE MINS THEN SAYS THE TRANSMISSION IS NO GOOD AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. CONSIDERING THIS VEHICLE IS GARAGED, & VERY WELL MAINTAINED ON A REGULAR BASIS I OPTED FOR A SECOND OPINION, ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE IS NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS, ODOR, SMOKE, LEAKAGE OR ANYTHING THAT INDICATES SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE TRANSMISSMISAION. JUST THE JERK WITH DEACCELERATION & MAYBE HESITATION WHEN TRYING TO ACCELERATE DURING THIS INCIDENT. THE SECOND SHOP'S DIAGNOSTICS CAME BACK SHOWING NO ISSUES WITH THE TRANSMISSION NOTHING.    TO YOU FORD I SAY  I'VE WATCHED YOUTUBE VIDEOS & READ SIMILAR COMPLAINTS, OBVIOUSLY A RECALL IS NEEDED, PLEASE WATCH YOUTUBE AND DO MORE RESEARCH REGARDING YOUR PRODUCT THAT IS AFFECTING YOUR CUSTOMER BASE.",

I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE UNTIL THIS PAST THURSDAY (09/11/2014) WHEN I PUT $40.00 WORTH OF GAS IN IT WHEN IT WAS CLOSE TO EMPTY. AFTER PUTTING IN $40.00 WORTH OF GAS, IT GAVE ME A APPROXIMATELY 3/4 TANK OF GAS.  I THEN PARKED IT AT MY PLACE OF WORK (NO INCLINE OF ANY SORT) AND STARTED TO SMELL GAS. THE TANK IS LEAKING ON THE PASSENGER SIDE UNDERNEATH.  AFTER WORK, I DROVE HOME (MAYBE 10 MILES) AND HAVE NOT EVEN MOVED THE VEHICLE UNTIL TODAY (09/13/2014) AND ONLY HAVE 1/4 TANK OF GAS LEFT.  NOT ONLY IS IT LEAKING GAS BUT THE INSIDE OF THE VEHICLE WREAKS.  I HAVE A 2 MONTH OLD CHILD WHO I AM AFRAID TO TAKE IN THE VEHICLE NOW BECAUSE THE SMELL IS SO STRONG.  THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED AS I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS SITUATION.  I SEE THAT 2008 FORD EDGE MODELS HAVE BEEN RECALLED DUE TO THE SAME PROBLEM.  I REFUSE TO SPEND CLOSE TO $2000.00 TO FIX THE PROBLEM.    THANK YOU.  *TR",

I QUESTIONED THIS AS I HAVE OWNED FORD VEHICLES FOR TEN PLUS YEARS APIECE AND NEVER HAD THE PROBLEM.  I WAS TOLD IT WAS NOT ABNORMAL. AFTER SEARCHING ONLINE I HAVE FOUND THIS TO BE A FREQUENT OCCURRENCE IN THE FORD EDGE VEHICLE.  NOW, I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT IT WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE THIS CAR HOME DUE TO A FIRE HAZARD  AND HAD TO RENT A VEHICLE RIGHT THEN AND THERE.  FROM THE NUMBER OF ONLINE COMPLAINTS I HAVE READ, I BELIEVE THE FORD EDGE NEEDS TO BE DEEMED UNSAFE DUE TO THE FUEL TANK LEAKING PROBLEM.  FORD NEEDS TO OWN UP TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE PUTTING THEIR CUSTOMERS' LIVES IN DANGER BY NOT RECALLING AND CORRECTING THE FUEL TANKS IN THESE VEHICLES WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE.  NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES OF LEAKING FUEL IS A DANGER TO EVERYONE.  IT IS NECESSARY TO ALSO MENTION THAT MY VEHICLE WAS SOLD TO ME AS CERTIFIED PRE OWNED ONLY 3 YEARS AGO WITH THE MILEAGE AT 32,579.   HOW ARE THEY PRECERTIFYING ? WITH COVER UPS????  SO, IN ESSENCE THE FACT THAT  THEY PRECERTIFIED 3 YEARS AGO MEANS THIS PROBLEM EITHER OCCURRED WITHIN 3 YEARS OR THE PRECERTIFICATION WAS BOGUS, EITHER OF WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE.  ALSO, THEIR WARRANTY WHICH COMES WITH THE PRECERT STATES FEB. 2013 OR 100,00 MILES.  THEY WILL NOT HONOR THE 100,00 MILES AS THEY SAY IT IS ONLY IF THE 100,00 MILES OCCURS BEFORE THE EXPIRATION DATE.  IF THAT WERE TRULY THE CASE, THE WORDING SHOULD SAY \"WHICH EVER COMES FIRST.\"  CHECK OUT THE FORD MANUAL TO VERIFY THIS INFO. THEY ARE MISLEADING AND DECEPTIVE IN THEIR WARRANTY DEFINITION AS WELL AS THEIR VEHICLES.  I HAVE ALWAYS OWNED A FORD - NEVER HAD A FUEL TANK PROBLEM, LOVED THE VEHICLES, BUT WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER ONE.  THEY ARE SHADY AT BEST.  *TR",

NUMEROUS VEHICLES HAD TO SUDDENLY STOP TO PREVENT FROM CRASHING INTO ME.  NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS EXTREMELY UPSET, BUT ALSO VERY THANKFUL NO ONE WAS INJURED.    NOW THE PROBLEM BEGINS.  NOTIFIED CHAPMAN FORD ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WAS TOLD TO BRING IN EDGE.  EXPLAINED TO SERVICE EDGE SLIPPED INTO NEUTRAL, ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON ALONG WITH WRENCH LIGHT.  AFTER PULLING OFF TO SIDE OF ROAD STILL COULD NOT GET CAR TO MOVE.  I THEN TURNED CAR OFF FOR A MINUTE OR SO, STARTED UP THE   CAR AND IT WAS FINE.  AFTER A FEW DAYS I RECEIVED A CALL TELLING ME IT WAS THE THROTTLE BODY AND WOULD COST 674.00 DOLLARS SINCE THIS WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  SO, THROTTLE BODY WAS REPLACED.  NOW MY EDGE BEGAN HAVING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM 1 MONTH AGO, WAS TOLD NOW IT WAS THE TRANSMISSION!  PROBLEM IS WARRANTY EXPIRED 1 MONTH AGO.  TIRED TO EXPLAIN HAD THE PROBLEM BEEN CORRECTED THE FIRST TIME, TRANSMISSION WOULD HAVE STILL BEEN UNDER WARRANTY.  SPOKE WITH NUMEROUS PEOPLE INCLUDING FORD, TO BE TOLD THE SAME THING \"WE CAN'T HELP SORRY YOUR WARRANTY EXPIRED\".  I AM NOW DRIVING MY EDGE WITH FEAR THIS CAN HAPPEN AT ANY TIME.  IT GIVES NO WARNING WHAT SO EVER, BY THE WAY MY EDGE ONLY HAS 28,000 MILES AND IS VERY WELL MAINTAINED.  I HAVE SEEN MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, AND FORD DOES NOT SEEN TO WANT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.  HOPEFULLY, NO ONE WILL GET SERIOUSLY HURT AND FORD WILL STAND BY THERE EDGE!  THANK YOU FOR YOUR  TIME, I HOPE THIS IS HELPFUL FOR OTHERS AND THIS SAFETY PROBLEM CAN BE RESOLVED.  *TR",

NEEDLESS TO SAY WE TRAVEL VERY OFTEN BY CAR TO VISIT FAMILY MEMBERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. SINCE HAVING OUR FIRST BABY 8 MONTHS AGO ON THIS LATEST CAR TRIP WE DECIDED TO USE OUR CARGO ROOF RACK FOR THE FIRST TIME. THIS ROOF RACK IS THE RACK THAT CAME ON THE FORD EDGE FROM THE MANUFACTURER. WE DECIDED TO BUY A SMALL 36\"X30\"X18\" CARGO BAG (CLOTH) TO PUT A FEW ITEMS IN & CARRY ON THE ROOF. FIVE MINUTES INTO THE TRIP ON THE HIGHWAY IN THE HOV LANE WE HEARD A LOUD SNAP NOISE & THE ENTIRE ROOF RACK BROKE OFF WITH OUR CARGO BAG & WENT FLYING OFF BEHIND US IN EARLY AM RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC NEARLY CAUSING A CAR ACCIDENT. NO SHOULDER ON THE HIGHWAY MY HUSBAND AND I HAD TO GET A POLICE OFFICER TO HELP US BLOCK THE HOV LANE SO WE COULD GET THE CARGO BAG & BROKEN ROOF RACK. THE CARGO HAD NO MORE THAN 60 LBS. WORTH INSIDE SO WE KNOW WE DIDN'T EXCEED ANY WEIGHT LIMIT. I MYSELF @ 130LBS & 5'2\" COULD PICK UP THE CARGO BAG MYSELF. WE DROVE STRAIGHT TO FORD DEALERSHIP WHERE WE WAITED THREE HOURS TO HEAR THAT FORD WOULD NOT REPLACE THE ROOF RACK BECAUSE IT WAS DAMAGED BY OUTSIDE CAUSES. I SHOULD MENTION THAT MY EDGE IS STILL COVERED UNDER THE 36,000.00 MILE BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THERE ISN'T A STITCH OF INFORMATION IN THE OWNERS MANUAL AS TO WHAT THE ROOF RACK WEIGHT LIMITS ARE OR HOW CARGO SHOULD BE STRAPPED TO IT. I WILL BE FILING AN APPEAL COMPLAINT TODAY & IF I HAVE TO I WILL GO STRAIGHT TO ALLAN MULALLY MYSELF. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT FORD WOULD NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT ESPECIALLY WHILE UNDER WARRANTY THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED A FATAL ACCIDENT. EVEN MORE DESPICABLY TREAT A FAMILY SERVING THIS COUNTRY WHO PUT THEIR TRUST IN THE FORD MOTOR VEHICLE COMPANY & THEIR \"WARRANTY\" COMMITMENT SO POORLY. WE HAD STRONGLY CONSIDERED BEING FORD OWNERS FOR LIFE, ESPECIALLY AS OUR FAMILY GREW BUT TO HAVE TO PUT UP A FIGHT OVER A ROOF RACK UNDER WARRANTY HAS CHANGED OUR MINDS. *TR",

ON 6/7/10 I TOOK THE CAR TO AN INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOP SPECIALIZING IN ABS BRAKES, WHERE THEY TOLD ME THE RIGHT REAR ABS BRAKE SENSOR HAD BEEN DAMAGED BY THE RIGHT REAR SENSOR RING, WHICH ITSELF WAS DAMAGED AND PARTIALLY SHREDDED. PER THE MANUFACTURER'S SERVICE BULLETIN, THAT SHOP THEN REPLACED BOTH REAR WHEEL SENSORS, AND THE RIGHT REAR WHEEL HUB WITH BEARING AND SENSOR RING. I WAS GIVEN THE OLD HUB WHICH I HAVE RETAINED AND WAS SHOWN THE FAILED SENSOR RING WHICH CAUSED THE ABS PROBLEM. BRAKES OPERATED PROPERLY WITH WARNING LIGHTS OFF AFTER THAT REPAIR.
