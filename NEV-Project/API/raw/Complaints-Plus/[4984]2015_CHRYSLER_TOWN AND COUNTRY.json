A moaning noise, which points to the transmission pump that was recalled on other same year models, seems to be the culprit according to the dealership, which requires a new or remanufactured transmission.  After speaking my wife, who was in the process of running errands on 1/5/2022, the vehicle did not make any noise upon starting on her trip, but did start a slight moaning noise at one of her stops, which she stated sounded similar to the sound a power steering pump makes when low on fluid.  Additionally, the vehicle was in for its annual safety inspection and PA emissions testing on 12/16/2021, for which it passed with no issues noted.  The vehicle is currently sitting at a garage (after getting an initial diagnosis at the purchased dealership, Jim Shorkey Chrysler in North Huntingdon, PA) to get a second estimate of needing a new transmission.  There were no warnings prior to this occurring, such as hesitation, check engine lamps, etc., and even on initial drop off, the check engine light still was not illuminated (the dealer has stated there are 3 codes for the transmission in the computer, but was not able to confirm whether the engine light was on now).  After now reading various Internet websites, speaking with both the dealer and a mechanic, and even to a local tow truck driver, these vehicles all appear to have very similar transmission issues.  The local mechanic stated he has replaced three of these exact transmissions for pump issues within the last few months.  Being that there is such a backlog on replacements of this model, this points clearly that it is a safety issue on these vehicles and many, many of the same model outside of the recall date are suffering the same fate and NEED to be recalled IMMEDIATELY.",

After inspecting the headrest I determined the plastic had broke and allowed the headrest to spring forward. The rod that locks the headrest in the normal position was still in the clamp indicating that the computer did not activate the headrest. The plastic holding the rod broke. Luckily the passenger was leaning up preparing to exit the vehicle so the headrest did not hit him in the back of the head. I called the dealer and asked if there was a recall for this issue and they indicated there was not.I believe this is an extremely unsafe incident and am afraid that the driver\u2019s side might be next.I believe it could cause serious head and neck injuries if falsely activated. I have researched and found many complaints about the same issue. I have temporarily put a strap on the headrest to hold it closed.",

THE  PROBLEM HAS ALWAYS BEEN DIAGNOSED AND EVENTUALLY \"FIXED\" BY THREE DIFFERENT CHRYSLER SERVICE DEPARTMENTS IN NC, FL & VA.(THE PROBLEM OCCURED ON VARIOUS TRIPS). IT WAS USUALLY  DIAGNOSED AS A FAULTY FUEL INJECTOR.  MOST RECENTLY IT WAS DIAGNOSED AS A SPARK PLUG FAILURE DUE TO A TINY CRACK IN THE INSULATION. THEY INSTALLED A NEW SPARK PLUG, AND AFTER LEAVING DEALERSHIP AND DRIVING NO MORE THAN 20 MILES, VIOLENT SHAKING OCCURED AGAIN.   I IMMEDIATLEY RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP. THIS TIME #3 SPARK PLUG HAD \"EXPLODED\" AND CAUSED THE CYLINDER HEAD TO CRACK. ALL PREVIOUS REPAIRS WERE COVERED BY THE \"LIFETIME\" WARRANTY PURCHASED AT THE TIME OF  PURCHASE IN 2014.  HOWEVER THIS TIME, CHRYSLER INSURANCE SENT AN INVESTIGATOR WHO DETERMINED THAT THE DAMAGE WAS  CAUSED BY THE EXPLODING SPARK PLUG AND THEREFORE DENIED COVERAGE.   THE CHRYSLER SERVICE TECHNICIAN SAID THE \"PCM\" FAILED, CAUSING THE SPARK PLUG FAILURE.  THE INSURANCE AGENT CONTINUES TO DENY THE CLAIM BECAUSE THEIR POLICY \"DOES NOT COVER SPARK PLUG PROBLEMS\" !  THEY NOW WANT ME TO PAY $2500 FOR REPAIRS.    IN ALL CASES, THE \"CHECK ENGINE LIGHT\" CAME ON AND I WOULD RETURN TO A CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP TO HAVE IT CHECKED. THEIR COMPUTER CHECK ALWAYS DEFINED THE PROBLEM AS BEING SOMETHING IN CYLINDER #3, BUT INCONCLUSIVE BECAUSE OF NO OBVIOUS  ENGINE SYMPTOMS. THEY WOULD RESET THE ENGINE LIGHT AND SEND ME ON MY WAY UNTIL AN ACTUAL PROBLEM OCCURED,  AND THEN LEAVE THE VEHICLE FOR MORE DETAILED CHECKING.  EACH TIME THE PROBLEM OCCURED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS  AND USUALLY IN HEAVY TRAFFIC ON I-95...A DANGEROUS TIME AND PLACE FOR ENGINE PROBLEMS TO OCCUR.

THE ISSUE IS ALWAYS WHEN THE TRANSMISSION IS SHIFTING. WE HAVE HAD IT LOOKED AT BUT THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE ISSUE, UNTIL. WHEN DRIVING TO THE GROCERY STORE THE VAN WOULD NOT GO INTO GEAR WHILE TRYING TO LEAVE THE PARKING LOT ONTO A MAJOR CITY HIGHWAY. THE VAN JERKED AND SHOOK AND THEN REVVED VERY LOUDLY GETTING TO ALMOST 8000 RPMS. THE CAR THEN LURCHED FORWARD ALMOST CAUSING US TO COLLIDE INTO TRAFFIC. AFTER THIS INSTANCE WE DECIDED A TO CALL THE ISSUE IN. UPON OUR INITIAL CALL, THE WARRANTY WAS EXPIRED AND THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO ANY REPAIRS UNDER THE WARRANTY. WHEN SEARCHING FOR RECALLS WHILE NONE SHOWED FOR OUR PARTICULAR VIN, MANY OTHERS HAVE HAD THIS SAME ISSUE.

NEAREST TOWING SERVICE WAS 20 MILES AWAY. WHY WAS CAR COMPANIES ALLOWED TO MAKE A SPARE TIRE A $350 OPTION? THE FANCY PUMP THEY PROVIDES THAT COMES WITH A RECHARGE CANISTER COST MORE THAN A SPARE TIRE. YOU PEOPLE REQUIRE SEAT BELTS AND AIR BAGS. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SAFETY SPARE? WHAT WOULD MY WIFE HAVE ONE IF I WASN'T THERE. NO SPARE IS MORE DANGEROUS THAN NO SEAT BELT. DO A SAFETY RECALL AND REQUIRE THE ADDITION OF SAFETY SPARE TIRES. MY WIFE COULD HAVE CHANGED THE TIRE.

I COULDN'T GET IT TO WHERE I COULD BE COMFORTABLE AND RECLINED THE SEAT TO KEEP MY NECK FROM BUMPING THE HEAD REST. AFTER 2 WEEKS OF THIS, I WAS PUTTING STUFF ON THE FLOOR BEHIND THE SEAT, LOOKED UP AND SAW THAT THE HEAD REST WAS POPPED OUT. I TRIED TO PUT IT BACK AND IT WOULD NOT BUDGE. AFTER RESEARCHING THIS ONLINE, I FOUND A LOT OF REPORTED INSTANCES OF THIS TYPE OF HEAD REST DEPLOYING WHEN THE CAR WAS PARKED OR WHILE IDLE. THERE ARE YOUTUBE VIDEOS SHOWING HOW TO RESET THE HEAD REST. WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP, THEY SAID MY HEAD REST WAS BROKEN AND WOULD REQUIRE REMOVING THE SEAT TO REPLACE IT WITH A NEW ONE FOR OVER $900. THE PASSENGER SIDE HAS THE SAME TYPE OF HEAD REST. IT COULD DEPLOY AT ANY TIME. I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS CAR. THE DEALERSHIP LEFT A VOICE MESSAGE SAYING MY WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED AND THAT I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING IT FIXED. I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE USED WITH UNDER 16,000 MILES ON IT. IT NOW HAS UNDER 41,000 MILES ON IT. IT PASSED INSPECTION.

SINCE IT WASN'T COVERED UNDER WARRANTY, WE HAD TO PAY FOR PARTS AND LABOR TO HAVE THE PIECE REPLACED (~$150).  ON WEDNESDAY 10/9/19, THE SAME TYPE OF TRIM CAME OFF ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR OF THE SAME VEHICLE WHILE MY WIFE WAS TRAVELING DOWN AN INTERSTATE.  FORTUNATELY, IN BOTH INSTANCES, NEITHER PIECE STRUCK ANOTHER VEHICLE.  ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT THE PIECE IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY (THE VEHICLE HAS PASSED THE MANUFACTURER WARRANTY PERIOD) AND COSTS MORE FOR SOME REASON EVEN THOUGH IT APPEARS TO BE THE SAME TYPE OF TRIM AS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE DOOR, THE BIGGER CONCERN IS THAT A PIECE OF TRIM LIKE THIS THAT BECOMES LOOSE AND FALLS OFF AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED IS AN OBVIOUS SAFETY HAZARD TO OTHER MOTORISTS.  THEREFORE, I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP TO ALERT THEM TO THIS ISSUE.  I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT THEY TOO HAVE IDENTIFIED THIS AS AN ISSUE AS WELL WITH OTHER SIMILAR VEHICLES AND HAVE FORWARDED THE ISSUE UP TO CORPORATE.  UNFORTUNATELY, CORPORATE DOESN'T FEEL THAT SUCH AN ISSUE RISES TO THE LEVEL OF A SAFETY RECALL - YET IT HAPPENED TWICE ON OUR VEHICLE ALONE.  CORPORATE ALSO SAID THAT THEY WILL NOT COVER THE COST OF THE PIECE TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE OF THE VEHICLE BEING OUT OF WARRANTY.  IN MY PERSONAL OPINION, WHETHER A VEHICLE IS IN OR OUT OF WARRANTY DOESN'T NEGATE OR EVEN LESSEN THE HAZARD AND POTENTIAL IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT HAZARD - ESPECIALLY ON A VEHICLE THAT IS ONLY 3 1/2 YEARS OLD.   MY BEST ASSESSMENT OF THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT APPEARS TO BE RELATED TO THE TRIM DESIGN AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS INSTALLED ON THE DOOR.  IT ALSO APPEARS THAT, OVER TIME, VIBRATIONS FROM THE VEHICLE WHILE IT IS IN MOTION MAY CAUSE THE TRIM PIECE TO LOOSEN AND ULTIMATELY FAIL.",

YET I WAITED FOR NEARLY A MONTH FOR A WESTCHESTER DEALER TO REPLACE THE ENGINE AND THEY DID NOT HONOR MY ADDITIONAL INSURANCE BY GIVING ME A RENTAL VEHICLE - SO I HAD NO TRANSPORTATION.  I HAVE HAD A HORRIBLE TIME WITH THE TROUBLES, INCONVENIENCES AND COSTS.  DON'T I HAVE ANY RIGHTS HERE?  I WAS DRIVING MY VEHICLE ON NARROW STREETS IN A BUSY RESORT AREA - THANK GOD IT WAS VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING BECAUSE THE CAR JUST STOPPED RUNNING WITH NO WARNING.  THIS TURNED OUT TO BE TRANSMISSION ON SUNDAY MORNING LABOR DAY WEEKEND!  I AM STILL IN THE RESORT AREA PAYING FOR HOUSING WHILE THEY \"FIX\" MY TRANSMISSION.  PARTS WERE TO ARRIVE YESTERDAY SEPT 10TH BUT DIDN'T ARRIVE UNTIL EARLY THIS EVENING.  THEY ARE NOT SURE THEY CAN HAVE IT FIXED BY FRIDAY SEPT 13, 2019.  LAST SUMMER THE ELECTRICAL STABILITY WENT BONKERS.  THAT WAS ANOTHER ISSUE.  ALSO MY VEHICLE KEEPS GOING DOWN IN VALUE.  I OWE MORE ON IT THAN IT IS NOW WORTH.

THEY TOO INDICATED THAT THE INSTALLATION KIT IS ON BACK ORDER.  IT IS NEARLY 6 MONTHS WITH NO WORD, FOLLOWUP ANYTHING FROM THE DEALERSHIP. ALL THIS WAITING ON AN INSTALLATION KIT.  THEIR ARE WINDSHIELD REPAIR PLACES THAT CAN REPAIR A WINDSHIELD IN A MATTER OF MINUTES WHY CAN'T THE DEALERSHIP?",

WITH OUT THINKING I OPENED THE SLIDING DOOR WHICH WAS ON THE SAME SIDE AS THE FUEL DOOR, CAUSING THE SLIDING DOOR TO CATCH THE FUEL NOZZLE AND KNOCK IT OUT OF THE VEHICLE. LUCKILY THE PERSON DOING THE FUELING REACTED QUICKLY AND THERE WAS NOT A REAL DISASTER. SO THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME TYPE OF LOCK OR SENSOR THAT WILL NOT LET THE SLIDING DOOR OPEN IF THE FUEL TANK REFUELING DOOR IS OPEN. WE WERE VERY LUCKY, A FEW SPLASHES OF GASOLINE ON US AND THE SIDE OF THE VAN. WE WERE ALL ADULTS, I CAN ONLY THINK OF HOW TERRIBLY WRONG THIS COULD HAVE GONE. THERE ARE MANY SCENARIO'S TO CONSIDER AND THINK ABOUT. I FELT SO BAD AND SCARED, I DO NOT WANT ANOTHER PERSON TO GO THROUGH THIS!!
