I paid it no mind at the time since I was parked amongst other vehicles in the parking lot and this has never happened before or at least since I owned the vehicle. I placed a card board box under the vehicle just to sense if it was my vehicle and have a sense of security that I had nothing to worry about. The next day I did notice that the box contained stains of fluid and smelled like gas. As this is my only vehicle I had to drive to work and noticed that the smell got worst. As I arrived at work I immediately did some research and found out that there was a recall on the matter, but I did not receive any information pertaining to recall etc. On my way back home I drove below the speed limit and in the slow lane just as a pre-caution. During that time the engine light came on putting my stress level even higher. As of today I have reached out to the dealership and expressed my concerns about the safety of my family with the fluid being gas and may cause a fire.  The response I received was that there was a recall, but it has since been closed. I have been taking the vehicle to be serviced at the Audi dealership and you would think that they would inform me of that information. I am awaiting a call from the corporate office to address my concerns at the moment and I don't think that it is going to be a good one. I contacted them before about the steering column issue where the system locks you out and would not allow access to get the vehicle started. I was told that it was my responsibility because of the age and mileage on the vehicle. Please note, I have not modified or changed anything on the vehicle. These are all manufacturing defects that they know exist.",
