        "summary": "I GOT MY BIKE FROM WINTER STORAGE FROM THE HARLEY DEALERSHIP ON 5/8/14.  THEY NEVER TOLD US THERE WAS ANY WORK DONE OVER THE WINTER.  AFTER ASKING FOR A SERVICE MANAGER ON 6/2/14, TO SEE WHAT THEY HAD DONE TO THE BIKE DURING STORAGE WE RECEIVED THE PAPERWORK THAT SAID THERE WAS A LEAK IN THE STATOR ASSEMBLY AND PARTS WERE REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY.  THE ROTORS ON THIS BRAND NEW BIKE (2954 MILES) WERE REPLACED AS THEY WERE STATED AS WARPED.  THIS BIKE WAS IN THE SHOP FOR A REGULAR CHECK UP FOR OIL CHANGE ETC. 8/21/14, AND THEY ADJUSTED THE CLUTCH ALSO.  THE BIKE WAS BEING DRIVEN THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT BY A 40 VETERAN DRIVER.  HE WAS DOING THE SPEED LIMIT OR LESS OF A BACK COUNTRY ROAD AND WAS SLOWING TO TAKING A CURVE, PUT IN THE CLUTCH AND THE DRIVER REPORTS THAT THE BIKE FELT LIKE IT JUMPED DOWN INTO 1ST GEAR.  THIS CAUSED THE DRIVER TO BE TOSSED OFF THE BIKE AND THE BIKE CONTINUE OVER 40+ FEET TO A DITCH.  THE DRIVER SUSTAINED INJURIES AS DID THE BIKE.  I AM SERIOUSLY CONCERNED THAT THE BIKE MALFUNCTIONED OR THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT RIGHT WITH THIS BRAND NEW BIKE NOT EVEN A YEAR OLD.  THE BIKE HAD ACTED FUNNY A SHORT WHILE EARLIER IN THE DAY, WHEN THE BIKE WAS STARTED IN NEUTRAL, THE BIKE WAS TILTED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT TO PUT UP THE KICK STAND AND THE BIKE SEEMED TO JUMP INTO GEAR AND JERK THE DRIVER FORWARD AND STALL.  I AM NOT SURE HOW TO HAVE THE BIKE CHECKED? I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT THE BIKE MALFUNCTIONED AND EVEN IF COSMETICALLY REPAIRED, IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE. I ALSO STRONGLY FEEL THAT THIS MALFUNCTION CAUSED THE ACCIDENT THAT OCCURRED.  CAN YOU HELP?      *JS",
