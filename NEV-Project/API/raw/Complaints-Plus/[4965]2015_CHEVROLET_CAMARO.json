In the event of an emergency, driver no longer has access to keys, driver is unable to leave car, battery drains (electric issues are already an issue that GMC will not address) and in the event driver is inexperienced at mechanics- this could lead to multifactor injuries.  Issue has been reported in other make/models for YEARS, GMC refuses to address issue.  In order to bypass this issue, owners must take apart steering column, release the Anti-Theft wire that enters the seliniod. Dealerships charge hundreds of dollars, sometimes never addressing the issue, to correct this problem. This key drains the electrical system, which will essentially cause complete failure to the car or a fire- which are happening more and more.  A parasitic battery drain occurs due to this issue, resulting in consumers attaching trickle charging units (recommended by dealers). Instead of correcting the anti-theft wiring issues along with the switch blade key fob, a single key was issued along with the defective key fob and dealerships are asking owners to replace their \"shifting units\" to correct the issue of the key not coming out of the ignition. This is a safety issue that will lead to death; a car fire, a home emergency, a mechanical necessity require immediate need for keys, an internal combustion, a car parked in neutral or a car left running to avoid the hassle of not getting the keys out of the ignition.",

ALREADY WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE THE CAR WAS PURCHASED BUT WAS TOLD IT COULD NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE IGNITION SWITCH. WRONG !!!   P.S. CAR WAS STATIONARY IN PARKING LOT OR DRIVEWAY IN EVERY SINGLE INCIDENT. THANK GOD!

THE CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED CHEVROLET CAMARO THAT I PURCHASED IS DEFECTIVE AND DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE MANUFACTURER AND DEALER EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY LOCATED AT CHAPMAN CHEVROLET IN PHILADELPHIA DUE TO THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY SHUTTING OFF WITHOUT WARNING WHILE  MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING IN TRAFFIC ON THE HIGHWAY. THE TECHNICIAN WHO DIAGNOSED THE  PROBLEM DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE WAS DUE TO A LARGE PRE-EXISTING WATER LEAK FROM A HOSE DETACHING FROM THE SUNROOF THAT IS LOCATED IN THE TRUNK CORRODING THE WIRING AND CAUSING ELECTRICAL SYSTEM DAMAGE THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO MY PURCHASE OF THE VEHICLE. WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE, THE MILEAGE WAS 29,883. THE CURRENT ODOMETER READING OF THE VEHICLE IS LESS THAN 34,000 MILES. THIS IS CLEARLY A DESIGN AND SAFETY DEFECT THAT ENDANGERED MY HUSBAND'S LIFE, AS WELL AS MINE, AND COULD HAVE  RESULTED IN THE CAR CATCHING ON FIRE OR CAUSING A CRASH. THIS DEFECT OF THE CAR HAS SUBSTANTIALLY IMPACTED MY ABILITY TO USE THE VEHICLE AND ITS VALUE. THE DEFECT HAS ALSO RENDERED THE VEHICLE UNSAFE FOR USE.
