At 97,774 miles had to have it serviced for excessive oil consumption  with timing cover and front crank seal cleaned and timing cover gasket replaced. Cost over $700. Then at 100333 miles had to have a new timing chain put in and water pump also the camshaft and cam phasers cost over $2,000. Now it is around 121000 miles and the lights on dash light up while driving to service stability track and I can not go faster then about 30 miles an hour. It then goes off and randomly comes back on while driving at any speed. Also there is a HUGE OIL PROBLEM with oil not just dripping like a small leak but spewing basically from underneath vehicle. I have to literally put oil in my car before I drive it anywhere because it all leaks out while I drive.   Was told by a macanic I have a leak where the engine meets the transmission and my options for fixing it are to totally replace the engine hahaha or get a new vehicle. Wtf GMC this is not ok!",

THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, A WARNING TO FOR \"SERVICE STABILITRAK\", THEN THE WARNING FOR \"ENGINE POWER REDUCED\". AT THE MOMENT MY CAR ALL THE SUDDEN SHUT OFF WHILE DRIVING DOWN A MAJOR HIGHWAY! THERE WAS NO POWER STEERING AND IT WAS VERY HARD FOR ME STEER MY CAR INTO THE PARKING LOT OF WALMART AND SAFELY OFF THE ROAD. ONCE IN THE PARKING LOT I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND CHECKED MY OIL. SMOKE IS ROLLING OUT OF THE DIPSTICK SHAFT. I CHECK MY OIL WEEKLY DUE TO GM'S OIL CONSUMPTION ISSUES WITH THE 2013 GMC TERRAINS AND ON 1/15/2020 THE OIL WAS AT FULL, WAS OF NORMAL COLOR AND CONSISTENCY WHEN I FUELED AND CHECKED IT THAT DAY. SO I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THAT THERE WAS NO OIL ON MY DIPSTICK AND INSTEAD A MILKY BROWNISH SLUDGE ON IT. I SENT MY FIANCE TO BUY ME 2 QUARTS OF OIL JUST TO GET IT TO THE WALMART SERVICE DEPARTMENT SO THEY COULD LOOK AT IT SINCE I WAS IN THE WALMART PARKING LOT. I ADDED THE OIL DROVE IT 100 YARDS TO THE SERVICE DEPT OF WALMART. THE SERVICE MAN PULLED IT INTO THE GARAGE AND THEN INFORMED ME A FEW MINUTES LATER THAT THE REAR MAIN SEAL BLEW AND OIL WAS FLOWING OUT OF IT. IT WAS NOT DRIVEABLE SO I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO A GM DEALER. THE GM DEALER CALLED ME THIS MORNING 1/21/2020 TO INFORM ME THAT THE REAR MAIN SEAL BLEW DUE TO MOISTURE IN THE INTAKE AND A FROZE THE PCV MODULE AND CAUSED TO MUCH PRESSURE TO BUILD UP AND BLEW THE SEAL.

HE FOUND GM BULLETIN 14882 ONLINE. WHAT IS DESCRIBED IN THAT VIDEO IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. WE HAD A SUDDEN HARD FREEZE X 3 DAYS. THE PVS CONNECTION AT THE INTAKE WAS FULL OF WATER. WHEN THAT FROZE, IT BLEW OUT THE SEAL. MY CAR HAS 88,000 MILES ON IT. THERE ARE VIDEOS AFTER VIDEOS ONLINE OF THE SAME ENGINE DOING THIS EXACT SAME THING. I CALLED GM.

ALSO, HAVING TO HOLD BRAKE AND GAS PEDAL AT THE SAME TIME DURING STOPS TO KEEP THE VEHICLE FROM GOING DEAD.  THE FIRST REPAIR WAS A MONTH AGO DUE TO CODE P0013 AND P0014 WHICH MY MECHANIC REPAIRED THE CAMSHAFT SENSOR AND ACCELERATOR SENSORS. THOSE WERE REPAIRED AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS STILL ON AND I RETURNED IT BACK TO MY MECHANIC WHO REPAIRED THE SENSORS AGAIN BECAUSE THE PARTS HAD A WARRANTY.  ONCE AGAIN AFTER LEAVING MY MECHANICS SHOP THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME RIGHT BACK ON AFTER DRIVING 8 MILES.  ALSO, LET ME SAY I DO TRUST MY MECHANIC, AS HE HAS WORKED ON MY PAST AND CURRENT VEHICLES WITH NO PROBLEMS.  ANYWAY, MY MECHANIC COULD NOT GET A PROBLEM CODE ON THE TERRAIN SO THE NEXT DAY THE VEHICLE WAS PROMPTLY TAKEN TO MY LOCAL GMC DEALERSHIP TO SEE IF THEY COULD DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.  THE MECHANIC AT THE GMC DEALERSHIP STATED THE VEHICLE NEEDED A TIMING CHAIN AND GEARS, WHICH WAS GOING TO RUN $1100-$1500 TO FIX.  I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY AND VEHICLE IS NOT COVERED BY A WARRANTY DUE TO THE YEAR AND MILEAGE.  AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET, IT SEEMS SEVERAL CONSUMERS ARE EXPERIENCING THIS SAME SAFETY ISSUES WITH THE GMC TERRAINS.  I HAVE ONLY HAD MY SUV FOR A FEW MONTHS AND MY DREAM VEHICLE HAS TURNED INTO A NIGHTMARE.  I HAD THREE LOCAL MECHANICS WITHIN THE LAST MONTH SAY 'THOSE VEHICLES ARE BAD TO GIVE TROUBLE' AND MY MECHANIC STATED THERE HAS BEEN NUMEROUS RECALLS ON THE TERRAINS OVER THE YEARS. THIS IS NOT SAFE AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE BY THE GMC MANUFACTURING COMPANY.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS STILL ON. THANK YOU",

KEEPING THE OIL LEVEL UP HELPS OBV, HOWEVER THIS PROBLEM WAS GOING ON FOR SOME TIME BEFORE I FIGURED OUT THE CAR WAS CONSUMING OIL AT A SUPER FAST RATE. SO WHO KNOWS WHAT DAMAGE MAY BE INSIDE THE ENGINE AT THIS POINT. IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE TIMING CHAIN ON THE I4 ENGINES AND THEY BURN OIL BECAUSE THE TIMING IS OFF. HOWEVER GM'S ONLY FIX THUS FAR IS TO RUN AN OIL STUDY WHICH TAKES UP A LOT OF TIME.THIS IS ALSO HUGE PAIN WHEN DEALING WITH ANY DEALER, BECAUSE ONLY A GM DEALER CAN RUN THE TEST, AND EVEN IF IT IS FOUND THAT YOUR CAR IS BURNING OIL THEY WILL DETERMINE IT AS \"NORMAL\" IF IT'S NOT A SPECIFIC RATE. THERE'S NO WAY FULL SYNTHETIC SHOULD BE BURNING UP THIS QUICKLY. GM NEEDS TO DO A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE BUT WILL NOT BECAUSE ONCE THEY TRULY FIX THE ISSUE IT WILL OPEN UP A CAN OF WORMS THAT WOULD COST THEM THOUSANDS. SO INSTEAD THE COST IS PASSED ON TO THE OWNER. IF THEY DO OFFER A FIX AFTER THE OIL STUDY IT'S ONLY FOR A PISTON RING KIT WHICH DOES NOT ACTUALLY FIX THE PROBLEM OF THE BAD TIMING CHAIN. SO FAR THE ONLY RELIEF I HAVE FOUND IS TO TURN THE ECO MODE OFF. THIS GIVES A LITTLE RELIEF TO THE CONSTANT FILLING OF OIL.
