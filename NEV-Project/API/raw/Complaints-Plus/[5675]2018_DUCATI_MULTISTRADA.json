        "summary": "I WAS RIDING FOR AROUND 4 HOURS ON THE INTERSTATE. I CAME OFF THE INTERSTATE AND ONTO THE SURFACE STREETS. I WAS ENTERING A PARK WITH A DIRT ROAD AND PARKING LOT. I WENT TO APPLY THE REAR BRAKE FOR STOPPING ON DIRT. THE REAR BRAKE LEVER CYCLED THROUGH THE ENTIRE STROKE. I PUMPED THE REAR BRAKE LEVER AND NO PRESSURE WAS BUILT UP. I HAD TO USE THE FRONT BRAKE TO STOP ON THE DIRT. AFTER VISITING THE PARK ABOUT 20 MINUTES THE BIKE WAS RIDDEN TO A GAS STATION AND THE REAR BRAKE STILL FAILED TO WORK. THE BIKE WAS THEN RIDDEN TO A LOCAL HOTEL STILL WITH NO REAR BRAKE.  THE NEXT MORNING I TESTED THE REAR BRAKE BEFORE LEAVING FOR THE DAY. THE REAR BRAKE HAD NORMAL PRESSURE AND A VERY SHORT LEVER STROKE AND WOULD STOP THE WHEEL (CENTER STAND). AFTER RIDING ON THE INTERSTATE FOR 2 HOURS I PULLED OFF FOR GAS AND THE BRAKE WOULD NOT ENGAGE. SINCE RETURNING HOME FROM MY TRIP I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING REPEATEDLY, BIKE COLD REAR BRAKE WORKS, BIKE HOT NO REAR BRAKE.",
