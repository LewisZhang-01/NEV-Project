The carport light was on, so I open the door to my car, slid into the driver\u2019s seat, started the car up and the lights came on.  As I was starting to get out of the car to go turn the carport lights off, I realized the car was going backwards.  I tried to get back into the driver\u2019s seat to try to stop the car but I was unable to do so.  The door knocked me down on the concrete floor of the carport and the front left tire ran over both my legs.  The car continued to go backwards, the door hit the column between the carport bays but continued to travel backwards down our approx. 11-foot paved drive way, crossed the dirt road and stopped when the back of the car went into the deep ditch that runs along the dirt road at that point. When my husband arrived, the car was still running and the lights were on. The man driving the wrecker for the local EMA Director and my husband all looked at the gear shift and the car was in PARK.",

The car went halfway across the tracks, then the forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking activated, stopping us on the tracks.

Finally was able to very slowly make my way through the crossing. I was on the tracks for 30-60 seconds.  No train was approaching and it was only my wife and me in the car, but if I'd had six passengers with me and another train had approached, I am not sure I would have been able to get everyone out of the car in time.  Note that there were no obstacles in front of the vehicle, but the sun was at a low angle from the front of the car and the sunlight was dappled through the treetops on the other side of the crossing (there's a left-hand curve after the crossing), creating a \"moving\" glare through the windshield.",

While accessing the rear portion of the vehicle (looking in boxes, accessing under floor storage compartment,etc) I have experienced on several occasions where the door starts to close. I was able to turn around, push the door upwards and the door stopped closing and reversed to the open area. This happened to our Buick Enclave that we own in Canada. The dealer was able to find on Buick's database where this was documented and the suggested solution was to \"turn this feature off using the \"control knob located in the driver's door\". My wife and I are 80 and this feature was one of the reasons that we purchased this model new in May 2020. So solution that Buick has offered is not the greatest. However, my wife is disabled and if the rear door had started to close on her, I do not think that she could have stopped the door from coming down. I will be notifying the Canadian highway vehicle association of this problem. But seems to me that Buick has a problem with the design of this system and is not addressing it.

WHILE IN EUROPE, I AM USING THE VEHICLES' \"METRIC\" SETTING (KPH VERSUS MPH), WHICH SWITCHES THE SPEEDOMETER TO READ KPH AND AUTO TUNES THE ENGINE TO THE APPROPRIATE LEVELS TO MATCH KPH.   I HAVE BEEN DRIVING THIS VEHICLE FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS UNTIL THE ISSUE HAPPENED LAST NIGHT AROUND 1830 HOURS CET.      ISSUE:  WHILE ACCELERATING AND TUNING LEFT FROM A STOP (STOP LIGHT WITH THE CITY), THE ENGINE SUDDENLY LOSS POWER THEN JERKED INTO A LOWER GEAR, BUT SOMEHOW GOT STUCK IN 3RD GEAR RESTRICTING MAX SPEED OF ABOUT 25-30 MPH RUNNING AT 5000 RPMS. AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO STOP, START, AND PROCEED, I FOUND THE VEHICLE SEEM TO BE SLIPPING WHEN SHIFTING FROM 2ND TO 3RD GEAR, BUT WOULD NOT GO BEYOND 3RD GEAR CAUSING THE ENGINE TO STRAIN AND REV AT AN UNSAFE LEVELS. TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO SHIFT TO \"L\" TO MANUALLY ENGAGE THE ENGINE, BUT IT KEPT CHANGING BACK TO \"D\" AUTOMATIC.  ALSO NOTED THAT WHEN THE VEHICLE REACHES THE NEXT PROGRAMMED GEAR SHIFT (E.G. 2ND GEAR TO 3RD GEAR) IT THEN JERKS, STALLS FOR ABOUT 2-3 SECONDS, THEN SUDDENLY ENGAGES 3RD GEAR RUNNING AT EXTREMELY HIGH RPMS AND NEVER SHIFTS BEYOND THAT. NOW CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON.  VEHICLE HAS NEVER BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT, DAMAGED, OR WRECKED.",
