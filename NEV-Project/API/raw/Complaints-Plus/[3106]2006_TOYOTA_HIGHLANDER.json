        "summary": "Brake Actuator Assembly is a known issue with several Toyota models including my Hylander Hybrid.  Toyota tried to address these actuator issues by extending the warranty coverage for the Brake Actuator Assembly on a limited basis, however; there is not an actual recall for this when there obviously should be.  Thousands of customers are left with unknowingly driving vehicles that are not safe and for those that have had their brakes fail (and survive) are left with $3,000-$4,500 in repair bills to resolve these issues.  In April 2021, I noticed odd purging-like sounds while stopped at stop signs or red lights when the brakes were engaged.  This concerned me so, I had our local Toyota dealership check out our highlander but they said there was nothing wrong with the vehicle and we assumed they knew what they were talking about so we went about our business.  Unfortunately, some months later while driving hundreds of miles from our home, the Check VSC light, ABS, Brake, and one other dash warning lights came on and the purging sound became much louder.  Lucky for us, the brakes still worked enough to stop the vehicle.  An official recall would have facilitated our local Toyota Dealer Service Dept in alerting us about these issues before we were put in a dangerous situation.  Our Hylander is currently being worked on at our local Toyota Dealership.  A guy in the service department is how we found out about the Toyota Customer Support Program that outlines the brake actuator shortcomings/failures. The service dept. manager's exact words were \"it's like a recall but it's not an official recall\".  Here is a video I found on the Toyota Nation website where this gentleman's wife had her brakes fail and hit a car in a  parking lot.  Thank god she was not injured!  https://youtu.be/mn_xs6k8_H4  Ultimately, all Toyota models with these faulty brake components should be recalled!!",

He told me that it has something that may be caused by some electrical problem . He thinks that it has to do with a recall about some soldering electrical part in the inverter control. This has happened in 3 more occasion and I've been lucky and i have time to let it go to side of the road and i disconnect the ground wire for 5 minutes and connect it back and it resets and then starts to work normal.

Toyota replaced it, but there was still buzzing after the service, from a NEW part!? I strongly expressed this to Toyota since it still seemed like an issue to me, but they told me nothing could be done unless the computer said it was bad or if there was a recall. The buzzing continued to get worse and does it almost all the time now, and finally the ABS light came on, sometimes it will make an alert noise, and the vehicle will not brake properly (with the brake pedal feeling very firm), so apparently now that the ABS light is on, a diagnostic showed it bad again. I have researched to find many other people experiencing this same issue with this part going bad AND continuing to quickly go bad even after replacing, and I have been advised the danger of this, for if it goes out while driving, you cannot brake like normal and cause an accident. If a brand new part was making the same buzzing noise when the previous part did not used to make that noise, then something seems very wrong! And this is very much a safety issue if your brakes suddenly stop working like they are supposed to! Please help! I appreciate your time. Thank you!",

        "summary": "In the last 4 weeks my 06 Highlander Hybrid has had malfunctions in the brakes and in the power steering.  Both issues rendering the car inoperable.    The first issue that was to arise was the brake actuator pump.  I noticed it was failing when i got in the vehicle to move it out of the driveway and noticed after i put the car in gear that their was no power brake assist.  When the car was shifted into drive the car began rolling even while i was pushing hard on the brakes.  Luckily the brake assist resumed and i did not run into anything but the car unintentionally moved about 5 feet.  I mentioned this to my wife, and she said while driving home one day the car made a high pitched buzz.  She was close to home, so she made it home and parked the car and forgot about the noise.  After the car was turned back on again no noise was made and no CEL or warnings were displayed.  The actuator was replaced, and the car operated fine for about one week and probably 40 miles of driving.  I want to mention I had noted a odd feeling in the brakes for years leading up the the failure.  The brake pedal would continue to the floor while trying to maintain constant pressure on the brakes.  I believe this is due to the actuator losing pressure, but it would cause an uneasy sensation of failing brakes, but no CEL's were ever triggered.  The new actuator fixed this.  After fixing the car we drove it on a few trips.  Yesterday 8/24/21 my wife went to drive the car, and it wouldn't start.  She tried about 10 times and it wouldn't turn on.  I put a battery charger on the car and the battery looked okay.  I tried to start it a few time probably 5 and finally got the READY light, so the car was ready to go, but all of a sudden the car would shut off and the READY light would go out and the P/S light would come on.  This light is triggered when something is wrong with the power steering system, and the computer will disable the vehicle.  The car immobile now.  These are worth recalling.",

The car was in my parking lot for a few hours before which it had no signs on.  The warning message said: Vehicle Stability Control (VSC). I took it to my nearest Toyota service center for diagnosing the issue. They reported that the ABS systems have started to fail. Specifically, the ABS actuator is losing pressure and should be replaced. They quoted a price of $2700 approx. which includes about $2000 for parts. Turns out that this same part had been replaced in 2016 during a recall - but they cannot attend to this again without charging the customer. What I was never told about was that a whirring sound - which has always been an issue with this car - was always from the ABS actuator. The same service center has checked and diagnosed this car multiple times - so I am surprised that they did not find the ABS actuator noise a problem on earlier occasions. I have been reading about this on this forum and Toyotanation and this seems to be a consistent issue with the older Toyota hybrid highlanders and other hybrids as well - with the same diagnosis and approximately the same price quoted by the service centers. I have not currently fixed this issue since I cannot afford this price. It also seems that I will be paying for manufacturer's or service center's negligence since this actuator seemed to be faulty all along and  I was not warned about this.",

THEY MANIPULATED OWNERS BY HAVING A WARRENTY SUPPORT PROGRAM WITH END DATES, INSTEAD OF HAVING A RECALL ON IT. WHICH IS WHY WHEN I RESEARCHED BEFORE I BOUGHT, IS NOT LISTED ON CAR FAX. THE WARRANTY SUPPORT WAS BEFORE I PURCHASED VEHICLE AND PREVIOUSLY IT WAS EITHER IGNORED OR MISSED BETWEEN OWNERS. THEY HAVE HAD MANY OF THESE AND GET AWAY WITH IT. RIGHT NOW THERE IS A CLASS ACTION FILED IN OHIO OVER THIS SAME ISSUE WITH OTHER CARS. IT IS A $3000 DOLLAR PART AND NOT A KNOB ON RADIO. IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE DUE TO IT BEING PART OF THE BRAKING SYSTEM. I'VE SEEN WHERE THE SUPPORT PROGRAM SAID MILES DIDN'T MATTER BUT WHEN TALKING TO TOYOTA THEY SAY 114,000 MILES. THE CAR IS A 2006, YEAH THAT'S REASONABLE, EVEN FOR 2017/18 LETTER.  WHILE DRIVING THE VSC ALARM SYSTEM COMES ON AND THE BRAKING BECOMES DIFFICULT. THE PUMP HAS ALWAYS MADE A SOUND BUT WAS TOLD BY DEALER IT WAS THE SECURITY ALARM SYSTEM MAKING THE NOISE. IT HAPPENED IN 2019 ALSO, THE ALARM, BUT REPAIR SHOP SAID IT WAS CALIPERS, SO PAID $800 TO HAVE THEM REPLACED WITH PADS. ITS ALWAYS MADE NOISE BUT THE ALARM SYSTEM STARTED BACK UP AGAIN LAST MONTH. NOW WITH RESEARCH ON MY OWN, I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS BUT TOYOTA SAID THEY SENT LETTER TO PREVIOUS OWNER AND SORRY ABOUT MY LUCK! THIS HAS RENDERED THIS VEHICLE WORTH $5500, WORTHLESS. CANT TRADE IN A VEHICLE LIKE THIS AND LOST MY INCOME FROM DELIVERY WITH IT. I HAVE CHECKED OFF EVERYTHING THAT WOULD APPLY IF IT WAS A RECALL BUT SINCE THE SUPPORT PROGRAM HAS AN END DATE TO GET OUT OF TOYOTA EVER BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR DEFECTIVE PART, THEY PUSH IT OFF ON OWNERS. I'M JUST LUCKY, I HAVE A CDL AND GOOD DRIVER AND HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH IT.

THE VEHICLE HAD BRAKE WORK DONE IN LATE APRIL WITH TOYOTA OF NASHUA AND REPLACED THE BRAKE FLUID. THE NEXT MORNING THE BRAKE WAS NOT EFFECTIVE (MAKING NOISE WHEN PRESSING BRAKE PADDLE AND DID NOT EFFECTIVELY STOP). BROUGHT TO THE TOYOTA DEALER AND WAS TOLD THE SEAL BROKE, CAUSED BRAKE FLUID GET TO MASTER CYLINDER, THUS FAILURE, AND THE BRAKE FLUID ALSO LEAKED TO THE BRAKE BOOSTER AND BOTH PARTS NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. WE FOUND TOYOTA HAD A RECALL ON OCT 21 2010, WHICH DESCRIBED THE EXACTLY THE SAME CAUSE AS HAPPENED TO THIS CAR. FILE A CASE WITH TOYOTA CORP AND THE RESPONSE WAS ANY PART CAN FAIL AT ANY TIME. THE VEHICLE PASSED 1 YEAR WARRANTY OF RECALL WORK. SO TOYOTA IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIR. NOTE, IN THE ORIGINAL RECALL, WHICH WAS 2010 FOR HIGHLANDER MANUFACTURED IN 2004-2006, WHICH IS AS LONG AS 6 YEARS LATER, TOYOTA MADE THIS RECALL AND STATED THAT THEY REIMBURSED THE REPAIR COST OF MASTER CYLINDER AND BRAKE BOOSTER IF DAMAGED. THERE WAS NO MILEAGE RESTRICTION. WITH TOYOTA'S RESPONSE, WHY EVEN BOTHER RECALL? THIS RAISED SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. IT'S VERY LIKELY TO CRASH WITH SUCH DAMAGE DUE TO THE SEAL LEAK. IF THIS CONTINUED TO BE A SAFETY ISSUE, TOYOTA SHOULD PUT THIS CHECK INTO THEIR REGULAR MAINTENANCE CHECK AND REPLACEMENT. THERE ARE QUITE A FEW REPORTED PROBLEMS WITH THIS ISSUE: HTTP://WWW.CARPROBLEMZOO.COM/TOYOTA/HIGHLANDER/BRAKE-MASTER-CYLINDER-PROBLEMS.PHP. TOYOTA'S RESPONSE SHOWS INDIFFERENCE TO THE CONSUMERS AND SAFETY OF THEIR LIVES. I HOPE THIS BRINGS TOYOTA MORE ATTENTION TO BE RESPONSIBLE TO THE DEFECT AS APPARENTLY THIS IS NOT THE SINGLE OCCURRENCE. WITH SUCH CONDITION OF THE BRAKE, IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY TO CAUSE CRASH.

IT SEEMS THAT THE BOLTS HAD COME LOOSE FROM THE ENGINE AND FLUID WAS GOING INTO THE PISTONS,THEY REPORTED TO ME THAT THE THREADS IN THE ENGINE WERE FAULTY, I THINK THEY SAID ALUMINUM, AND THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN METAL. I AM NOT MECHANICALLY INCLINED SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE PROBLEM. THEY SAID THAT THE ENGINE HEAD WAS NOT SECURE AND THIS HAS HAPPENED TO OTHER TOYOTA ENGINES. ANYWAY, AT 70 YRS OLD, IT TOOK ALL THE MONEY I HAD TO REPAIR IT AND THEY INSISTED THAT I LOOK FOR A RECALL, BECAUSE THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED. $1842.00 LATER, THE CAR IS RUNNING LIKE IT SHOULD NOW. IF TOYOTA DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF ME, I WILL SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE SPREADING THE WORD.  I WILL START AT THE RHODE ISLAND DEALERS, GO ON LINE AND CONTACT ALL THE PROPER AREAS.  THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED TO MY TOYOTA.THIS IS THE CAR THAT THEY ADVERTISE WILL LAST 265000 MILES IF MAINTAINED PROPERLY. I BOUGHT THE CAR AT EARL STEWART TOYOTA IN LAKE PARK, FLORIDA. [XXX]  TOLD ME HE WAS SORRY THAT THIS HAPPENED, TO REPORT IT TO TOYOTA. MY WIFE PASSED AWAY AND IT MOVED BACK TO MY HOME STATE IN RHODE ISLAND.

I BELIEVE THE LEATHER MATERIAL USED IN THE VEHICLE IS OF POOR QUALITY. ON 4/28/10 TOYOTA EVENTUALLY RESPONDED TO MY COMPLAINT, STATING THE WARRANTY FOR THE SEAT IS 3-YEARS OR 36,000 MILES: THEIR FILE # 1003280070; INCIDENT 100426-000166. THEY SUGGESTED I CONTACT A DEALER, WHICH I DID:ON 7/27/10 I HAD A TOYOTA DEALER LOOK AT THE SEAT AND THEY CONCLUDED THAT THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRE. I AM OBVIOUSLY NOT SATISFIED WITH TOYOTA'S RESPONSE; THEIR ESTIMATE FOR ME TO REPLACE THE SEAT CUSHION COVER IS $1123.36 INCL TAXES. I BELIEVE SUCH AN EXPENSIVE VEHICLE SHOULD BE OUTFITTED WITH A HIGHER GRADE LEATHER SEAT COVER. I HAVE HAD CHEAPER  VEHICLES WITH LEATHER SEATS WHICH LASTED MANY MORE YEARS THROUGH THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE. TOYOTA HAS DONE AN INJUSTICE WITH THE INSTALLATION OF THIS POOR QUALITY LEATHER AND I FEEL CHEATED BY SUCH ACTION. THERE MUST BE OTHER OWNERS WHO HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE THAT I HAVE WITH THE SEAT. THE SEAT WAS NOT DELIBERATELY TORN OR CUT AND WE ARE QUITE PETITE PEOPLE. WHEN I VIEW THE LEATHER IN MY OTHER CAR THE CORNERS WHERE THE DRIVER SLIDES IN SEEMS TO BE STRONGER AND POSSIBLY RE-ENFORCED TO FACILITATE THE DRIVER'S INITIAL WEIGHT. TOYOTA HAS NOT DONE A GOOD JOB TO ENSURE THE LASTING WEAR AND TEAR OF THE SEAT. IS THIS DELIBERATE? HOW DID THEY COME UP WITH A 3YEAR, 36000 WARRANTY? WHAT TESTING DID THEY PERFORM TO DECIDE THE SEAT WILL ONLY LAST UP TO THAT PERIOD, THEREFORE THEY WERE SURE TO MAKE A LOT OF MONIES ON REPLACEMENT AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRED? THIS IS UNFAIR.

VEHICLE  STAYS IN BETWEEN GEARS AND HESITATES.  ONCE IT GETS INTO GEAR THE VEHICLE LUNGES FORWARD, MAKING IT NECESSARY TO APPLY THE BRAKES HARD.

IT IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.  I NOTIFIED TOYOTA AND THEY TOLD ME TO WORK THROUGH THE DEALER.  I NOTIFIED THE DEALER AND THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT.  AFTER READING THE MANY POSTS ON THE INTERNET ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM, IT SEEMS TOYOTA AND THE DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENTS ARE TELLING CUSTOMERS THAT THE VEHICLE WAS DESIGNED TO ACT THIS WAY.  THE DEALERSHIPS THAT TRY TO REPROGRAM THE CHIP THAT CONTROLS ACCELERATION ARE NOT HAVING ANY LUCK FIXING THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM RETURNS SOMETIMES WORSE THAN IT WAS BEFORE.  AT PRESENT THERE IS NO RECALL AND NO TSB.  THE 'FIX' SEEMS TO BE BASED ON EXPERIMENTATION NOT FACT.  I WILL GIVE THE DEALER A CHANCE BUT I HAVE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE.  SINCE THERE IS NO FIX AND TOYOTA IS NOT WILLING TO ADMIT TO DEFECT, I FEAR I WILL BE FACING MANY VISITS TO THE DEALER GETTING A LOT OF LIP SERVICE WITHOUT ANY ACTION.  I AM SURPRISED THAT TOYOTA, THE BEACON OF QUALITY, IS IGNORING THIS POTENTIALLY SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM. LETS NOT WAIT FOR THE ACCIDENT TO SPURN A RECALL OR INVESTIGATION.
