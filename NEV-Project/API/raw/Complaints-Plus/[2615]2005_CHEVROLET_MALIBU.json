ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO, SHE ALERTED US TO AN INTERMITTENT TWITCHING OF THE STEERING WHEEL WHICH CAUSES IT TO SHAKE AND AS A RESULT MAKES THE VEHICLE A LITTLE  MORE DIFFICULT TO STEER. NOW, THE VEHICLE INTERMITTENTLY DISPLAYS THE POWER STEERING ALERT ON HER RADIO AND IS DOING THE TWITCHING THING MORE OFTEN. I CONTACTED CHEVY WHO, OF COURSE, INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS A RECALL REGARDING THE POWER STEERING BUT THIS VEHICLE VIN WAS NOT INCLUDED. THE CAR NOW HAS 52,700 MILES ON IT AND THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH THIS IS HAPPENING IS A BIG CAUSE FOR CONCERN. CHEVY DID SEND ME AN EMAIL WHICH PROVIDES $100 TOWARD SERVICE AT A DEALERSHIP, WHICH TELLS ME THAT THEY ARE VERY AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM HOWEVER CHOOSE NOT TO ADDRESS IT UNTIL THERE IS A SERIOUS ISSUE. I AM TAKING THE VEHICLE IN FOR A DIAGNOSTIC THIS WEEK BUT AS I SAID THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT AND TO GET THE FAILURE TO APPEAR TYPICALLY OCCURS WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING.

HE RESIDES AT [XXX], AND OWNS A 2005 CHEVROLET MALIBU.    [XXX] RECEIVED THREE SAFETY RECALL NOTICES THAT ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW:    JUNE 2014 - FIRST RECALL NOTICE STATED: YOUR VEHICLE, EQUIPPED WITH EPS MAY EXPERIENCE A SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER STEERING ASSIST THAT COULD OCCUR AT ANY TIME WHILE DRIVING.  STEERING CONTROL CAN BE MAINTAINED, AS THE VEHICLE WILL REVERT TO A MANUAL STEERING MODE, BUT WOULD REQUIRE GREATER DRIVER EFFORT AT LOW VEHICLE SPEEDS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASED RISK OF A CRASH.    JULY 2014 - SECOND RECALL NOTICE STATED: TRACTION CONTROL, ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL (ECS), AND PANIC BRAKING ASSIST FEATURES, IF EQUIPPED, MAY BE DISABLED.  SERVICE ESC AND/OR TRACTION CONTROL TELL-TALES LIGHTS MAY ILLUMINATE WITH THIS CONDITION.  THESE CONDITIONS MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF A CRASH.    JULY 2014 - THIRD RECALL NOTICE STATED: YOUR VEHICLE HAS A CONDITION IN WHICH THE TRANSMISSION SHIFT CABLE MAY FRACTURE AT ANY TIME.  IF THE DRIVER CANNOT PLACE THE VEHICLE IN PARK, AND EXISTS THE VEHICLE WITHOUT APPLYING THE PARK BRAKE, THE VEHICLE COULD ROLL AWAY AND A CRASH COULD OCCUR WITH PRIOR WARNING.      [XXX] CONTACTED THE LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP IN JUNE 2014.  THE LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP IS: KELLER CHEVROLET ([XXX]),.      RESOLUTION:  [XXX] FEELS THAT WHILE HE IS WAITING FOR GM TO RECEIVE REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR HIS 2005 MALIBU, THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP SHOULD PROVIDE HIM WITH A SAFE LOANER VEHICLE AS HIS EXISTING 2005 MALIBU.      [XXX] CAN BE REACHED AT:    [XXX]    THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION IN THIS MATTER.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",

THERE WAS NO LONGER THE POWER STEERING DISPLAY AND THE POWER STEERING HAD RETURNED.  A RECALL NOTICE WAS ISSUED ON APRIL 21 FOR ELECTRIC POWER STEERING ASSIST FOR THIS GENERATION OF MALIBU (GM RECALL NO. N140116; NHTSA RECALL NO. 14V153) BUT WE STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN A LETTER. WHEN I CALLED THE CHEVROLET CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CENTER, I WAS TOLD PARTS ARE STILL NOT AVAILABLE. APPARENTLY THERE ARE THREE OTHER GM ELECTRIC POWER STEERING RECALLS, WITH PARTS AVAILABLE FOR THOSE THREE OTHERS BUT NOT OUR CAR. SO FAR THE PROBLEM HASN'T RETURNED, BUT ONCE IT HAPPENS THE FIRST TIME DOUBT GETS PLANTED. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THIS IS AT LEAST THE SECOND TIME THERE HAS BEEN SUCH A RECALL. WE GOT A RECALL NOTICE IN LATE 2007 FOR THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM AS WELL, AND I'M PRETTY SURE THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE BEFORE THIS YEAR'S RECALL.",

A LOCAL AUTO PARTS STORE SAID I SHOULD USE A FUEL INJECTION KIT FOR THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT. NOW I HAVE 146XXX MILES AND IT HAPPENS EVERY SINGLE TIME I GET GAS. IT'S NERVE RACKING BECAUSE I DO DRIVE FREQUENTLY AND MY MAIN CONCERN IS HOW MUCH GAS DO I HAVE? I CAME ACROSS A GUY THAT WORKS AT A DIFFERENT AUTO STORE AND HE SAID IT'S PROBABLY MY SENDER UNIT FOR MY GAS TANK, WHICH SHOULD COST ABOUT $300 TO FIX DEPENDING ON WHERE I TAKE IT. MY NEXT SET OF ISSUES IS MY HORN, I WAS UNAWARE THAT IT DIDN'T WORK UPON PURCHASING UNTIL I WENT TO HONK IT AND NOTHING HAPPENED. I TOOK IT TO MIDAS AND THEY REPLACED THE FUSE. AFTER DRIVING IT HOME THE HORN STOPPED WORKING AGAIN. I HEARD IT'S JUST SOME WIRES TOUCHING BUT NOBODY DOES ELECTRICAL WORK. TODAY, A FRIEND ASKED IF MY TURN SIGNALS WERE WORKING. I SAID THEY DID AND HE SAID THEY WERE BURNT UP, PLASTIC AND ALL. I LOOKED AND SURE ENOUGH THEY WERE MELTED AND THE LIGHT ITSELF WAS BLACK ON THE INSIDE AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT'S ON THE VERGE OF SHATTERING. HE ASKED IF THERE WERE RECALLS ON ANYTHING WITH THIS CAR, I TOLD HIM I CALLED A LOCAL CHEVY DEALER AND THE GUY INSISTED OTHERWISE. NOW, I CHECKED THIS WEBSITE AND BOTH THE GAS AND LIGHTS ARE ON A LIST OF RECALLS. APPARENTLY, NOT ALL DEALERS KNOW HALF THE INFORMATION THEY SHOULD FOR CONCERNED DRIVERS. *TR",

ACCORDING TO THEIR NEW COMMERCIALS 'CHEVROLET RUNS DEEP' THEY ARE RIGHT, CHEVY DOES RUN DEEP, DEEP INTO YOUR POCKET.

THEY GO ON WITHOUT PUTTING ON THE BRAKES AND GO OFF WHEN I PUT ON THE BRAKES. IN ADDITION, THE CRUISE CONTROL WORKS INTERMITTENTLY.  I FOUND A TSB DATED 2009-06-01 THAT DESCRIBES IT PERFECTLY. CHEVY CAN'T FIND THE SAME TSB IN THEIR SYSTEM AND WON'T HELP ME. THE DEALER REPLACED THE BRAKE LAMP, BUT THAT IS CLEARLY NOT THE PROBLEM (BASED ON THE TSB). THE DEALER CAN'T SEE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S INTERMITTENT. I WANT THIS FIXED (THE CAR IS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE) BUT DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO PAY AGAIN, WHEN I FIRST PAID FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS CLEARLY THE WRONG SOLUTION, AND FOR WHICH THE DEALER COULD HAVE FOUND THE SAME TSB THAT I FOUND (EVEN IF IT'S NOT IN THE GM SYSTEM). THE SOLUTION APPEARS TO BE \"HIGH RESISTANCE TO TERMINAL FRETTING CORROSION IN THE BODY CONTROL MODULE (BCM) C2 CONNECTOR (SPECIFICALLY PINS C2-18, C2-31, AND C2-59).  THE CORRECTION IS TO UNLATCH THE C2 CONNECTOR AND DISCONNECT FROM THE BCM.  THEN REPEAT THIS AND THEN APPLY DIELECTRIC LUBRICANT ON THE BCM C2 PINS.  IT IS NOT A BRAKE SWITCH PROBLEM.  PLEASE CONTACT ME AND LET ME KNOW WHAT OPTIONS I HAVE, AND IF NHTSA CAN DEAL WITH GM ABOUT THIS. THANK YOU.  *LN",

HER CAR, A 2005 CHEVY MALIBU WITH 68,000 MILES, HAS BEEN IN FOR REPAIRS FOUR TIMES. . . LONDOFF HAS EXTRACTED OVER $1400.00 FROM THIS WIDOW WOMAN, CONTINUING TO REPLACE PART AFTER PART WHICH HAS DONE NOTHING TO ALLEVIATE THE COMPLAINT. THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS !!!!  THE INTERNET REVEALS THOUSANDS OF IDENTICAL COMPLAINTS!  ESSENTIALLY, MS. X'S CHEVY STOPS RUNNING, OR SLOWS TO 15 MPH WHILE IN THE FAST LANE OF THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY WHERE THE SPEED LIMIT IS 60 MPH WITH NO WARNING!  THE LAST TIME THE CAR WAS TAKEN INTO LONDOFF, THE SERVICE MANAGER, MR. B W.  ADVISED THAT AFTER TAKING $1400.00 FROM MY FRIEND FOR \"REPAIRS\" THAT DID NOT EFFECT A REPAIR, THAT LONDOFF WAS GOING TO REPLACE THE \"POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE\" UNDER FACTORY WARRANTY, TO COMPLETE THE REPAIRS WHICH THE PREVIOUS REPAIRS DID NOT FIX.  TO MAKE THE STORY SHORT, LONDOFF REPLACED THE PCM AND THROTTLE BODY / PEDAL FOR MRS. X, AND NOW 30 DAYS LATER, THE CAR ONCE AGAIN STALLS IN THE FAST LANE - IN THE RAIN, AS HUGE TRACTOR TRAILERS CAME BARRELING DOWN ON HER AT HIGH SPEED AT NIGHT.  I FEAR FOR BOTH MY FRIENDS LIFE AND HER SAFETY IN THIS ' 05 MALIBU.  WE TOOK THE CAR IN AGAIN TODAY FOR THE 4TH REPAIR OPPORTUNITY FOR LONDOFF, AND \"MR. W\" REFUSED TO GUARANTEE TO MAKE GOOD ON THE 12 MONTH, 12000 REPAIR WARRANTY, AND REFUSED TO PROVIDE EITHER A LOANER OR A RENTAL AT GM'S COST SO MRS. X COULD MAKE IT TO WORK NEXT WEEK.  ESSENTIALLY, THESE MEN CONTINUE TO \"JACK UP\" THIS POOR WIDOW WOMAN, TAKING MORE AND MORE OF HER MEAGER SUSTENANCE WITHOUT EFFECTING REPAIRS!!!!  MRS.X'S  LIFE, HER JOB, HER HOME, HER CREDIT, HER CHILDREN'S COLLEGE EDUCATION IS THREATENED BY GM / LONDOFF'S FAILURE TO PROPERLY REPAIR THIS VEHICLE.  IN ADDITION, TIME AFTER TIME THIS CAR HAS BROKEN DOWN IN THE FAST LANE  IN HEAVY TRAFFIC DURING A THUNDERSTORM.  OBVIOUS RECALL !!!  UPDATED IVOQ 12/01/10  *TR",

THIS INDICATES EXTREME SOCKET TEMPERATURE AND ALSO THE RISING HOT AIR AFFECT THE CEILING OF THE AMBER HOUSING.  ALL THE BURNT OUT LIGHT BULBS SHOWED VARIOUS DEGREES OF CHARRING/MELTING/DEFORMATION ON THE PLASTIC BASE.  THIS COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE EXTREME HIGH TEMPERATURE AND ELECTRICAL ARCING.

SO SAFE, THAT I ALLOWED MY TEENAGE SON TO DRIVE MY CAR.

I THANK GOD HE WAS NOT GOING FAST, THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER CARS OR PEOPLE INVOLVED, AND HE WAS NOT HURT.  I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO MY MECHANIC WHO IS A CERTIFIED MASTER TECHNICIAN, WHO WORKED FOR GM AS A LINE TECH FOR 25 YRS. HE INFORMS ME THAT THIS SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED IN A CAR THAT IS ONLY 4 YRS OLD, AND FELT IT WAS DEFECTIVE. HE SAID THE FAILURE OCCURRED INSIDE THE STEERING RACK CAUSING THE PINION TO DISENGAGE RESULTING IN LOSS OF CONTROL.  I THEN HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A GM DEALER WHO?S MECHANIC SAID THE SAME THING BUT BECAUSE I DID NOT BUY THE CAR FROM THEM, THEY WOULD NOT HELP ME?.MY NEXT STEP WAS TO CONTACT GM?.THEY TOOK A WEEK TO INVESTIGATE?AND DECIDED THAT BECAUSE I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM A PRIVATE CAR DEALER, IT HAD 86K MILES ON IT AND IT WAS PAST THE FACTORY WARRANTY THEY FELT NO NEED TO DO ANY THING ABOUT THIS. NOT ONLY WAS THE STEERING RACK AND PINION DAMAGED, THE POWER STEERING UNIT UNDER THE DASH AND THE AIR BAG COILS WERE DAMAGED AS WELL. THE COST TO REPAIR THIS IS OVER $2000.00.

GENERAL MOTORS KNEW THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE A LACK OF POWER STEERING, VIBRATION, OR A  RATTLE OR CLUNK NOISE FROM THE LEFT LOWER INSTRUMENT PANEL. GM SHOULD HAVE RECALLED THESE CARS TO FIX THEIR PROBLEM. I WAS TOLD THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS A SAFETY ISSUE AND THAT GENERAL MOTORS SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE. I TOOK THE CAR TO A GM DEALER AND HE AGREED THAT GM SHOULD FIX THE CAR. I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH GM AND FINALLY AFTER CALLING FOR 2 WEEKS, THEY SAID THEY WOULD DO NOTHING. I AM VERY UPSET WITH GM AND JUST WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE WRECKED MALIBU'S BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF POWER STEERING. IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE CARS, I SUGGEST YOU SELL IT OR TAKE IT TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR BEFORE YOU LOSE YOUR POWER STEERING WHEN PULLING OUT INTO AN INTERSECTION AND THE CAR DIES IN FRONT OF ANOTHER VEHICLE. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER GM PRODUCT AND ADVISE THE SAME FOR ANYONE ELSE. *TR",

THE DIAGNOSIS FROM DEALER 1'S MECHANIC WAS THAT THERE WAS ALMOST NO TRANSMISSION FLUID IN THE CAR AND THE GEARS BURNT OUT.  HE TOLD ME THERE WAS NO WAY THIS COULD BE FROM A PROBLEM WITH THE CAR AND I HAD TO PAY FOR THE NEW TRANSMISSION; WHICH I LATER LEARNED WAS UNTRUE.  THE MECHANIC STATED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WOULD SLOWLY BURN OUT (OVER MONTHS) WITH LITTLE/NO FLUID IN IT.  FROM PURCHASE, I COMPLAINED MANY TIMES TO THE DEALER THAT THE STEERING COLUMN WOULD CLICK WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TURNED AND THAT THE BRAKES DID NOT FEEL RIGHT.  THE MANY TIMES I BROUGHT MY CAR IN FOR SERVICE I WOULD MAKE THESE COMPLAINTS AND BE TOLD THAT EVERYTHING WAS FINE. APRIL 2008 WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, THE ENGINE STARTED REVVING. THE CAR HAD NO POWER AND STARTED LOOSING SPEED. AT MY EXPENSE, IT WAS TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALER. (DEALER 2)  THE MECHANIC SAID THEY STARTED OPENING THE TRANSMISSION BUT IT WAS SO BADLY DAMAGED, DID NOT FINISH. HE HAD NO EXPLANATION FOR THE DAMAGE. DEALER 2 HAD ALREADY ORDERED YET ANOTHER TRANSMISSION AND HE TOLD ME THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE MECHANIC FROM DEALER 1 HAD SAID.  DEALER 2 AND OTHER MECHANICS I HAVE TALKED TO SINCE, TOLD ME THAT WITHOUT FLUID THE TRANSMISSION WOULD NOT SHIFT, AND WITH LOW FLUID IT WOULD NOT BE MONTHS BEFORE THE TRANSMISSION BURNT OUT, IT WOULD BE DAYS OR DEPENDING ON THE FLUID LEVEL, EVEN MERE HOURS.  THE TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED AGAIN BY DEALER 2.  I PICKED THE CAR UP AND GOT 12 MILES WHEN THE ODOMETER AND POWER STEERING FAILED AND THE TRANSMISSION WOULD NOT SHIFT OUT OF FIRST GEAR. DEALER 2 TOLD ME THAT THE SPEED SENSOR ON THE NEW TRANSMISSION WAS BAD AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.  *TR",

IN LESS THAN 40 MILES OF TOTAL DRIVING SINCE PICKING UP THE NEW CAR, THE STEERING WHEEL HAD SO MUCH PLAY (ROCKED 3/4 OF AN INCH FRONT TO BACK AT EITHER SIDE AND COULD BE PUSHED IN AND GENTLY PULLED BACK AT LEAST 1/2\" ON SPLINED SHAFT) THE CAR WAS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE. SINCE I DID NOT HAVE NEARBY ACCESS TO DEALER, I HAD A BODY SHOP OWNER AT MY FIRST STOP LOOK AT THE PROBLEM. TO GET RIGHT TO THE POINT, AFTER REMOVING THE PLASTIC STEERING COLUMN COVERS AND ADJACENT COVER ON COLUMN SIDE OF STEERING WHEEL, THE RETAINING NUT FOR THE STEERING WHEEL COULD BE TURNED WITH A FINGER AND WAS NEARLY OFF THE END OF THE STEERING SHAFT. THE SHOP OWNER WAS ABLE TO ACCESS THE NUT WITH AN OPEN END WRENCH AND MADE AT LEAST 4 FULL TURNS ON THE NUT BEFORE IT BEGAN TO OFFER RESISTANCE.
