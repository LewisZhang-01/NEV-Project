SO TAKING IT TO A SHOP TO RUN A TEST IS ALMOST MEANINGLESS UNLESS TOWED AND EVEN THEN IT'S NOT 100% CHANCE YOU'RE GOING TO GET A CODE(S) TO READ. THE LAST FEW MONTHS THE PROBLEMS HAVE GOTTEN WORSE. THE BIG OCCURRENCE CAME WHEN I WAS JUST TWO MINUTES DOWN THE ROAD FROM WHERE I LIVE, I HAD THE VUE NOT START UP OR EVEN TURN OVER AND THE KEY WAS LOCKED IN THE IGNITION. I OPENED UP THE HOOD, TAPPED ONCE ON THE BLACK BOX ON TOP OF THE BATTERY AND THE VUE STARTED DINGING AND WAS ABLE TO TURN THE VEHICLE ON.

ON MAY 9, 2017 SCOTT AUTOMOTIVE PUT NEW BRAKES ON THE CAR. THEY COULD NOT GET A READING FROM THE ABS/TC CONTROL SYSTEM AND SUGGESTED TAKING IT TO A DEALER - IT WOULD NOT COMMUNICATE. A TIRE PRESSURE LIGHT CAME ON AS WELL AND LATER IN THE WEEK, CARTER AUTO REPAIR REPLACED THE TIRE PRESSURE SENSOR AND STATED WITH THE CORRECT READING EQUIPMENT THE ABS/TC STILL WAS NOT COMMUNICATING AND ALSO SUGGESTED HAVING GM PERFORM A READING. GM TECHNICIANS' ONLINE RESPONSES TO FORUM COMPLAINTS OF 2008 SATURN VUE (AND OTHER MODELS) STABILITY TRACK SYSTEM AND TRANSMISSION ISSUES LEAD ME TO BELIEVE GM IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS BUT HAVE YET TO TAKE RECALL ACTION TO ADDRESS THEM. THE VEHICLE RUNS THROUGH A SELF-CHECK OF THE SENSORS WHEN THE CAR IS PARKED WITH ONLY THE AWD LIGHT BLINKING AND THE NORMAL ALL LIGHTS FLASH ON THE DASH AND THEN THE BRAKE, ABS, BOTH TC/ESP LIGHTS COME ON AND STAY ON AND THE AWD LIGHT CONTINUES TO BLINK. FROM WHAT I HAVE READ, THE TRACTION CONTROL/ELECTRONIC STABILITY AND ABS ARE NOT ON AND WORKING SO I AM HOPING WHEN I TAKE THE CAR TO GM ON WEDNESDAY THEY WILL OFFER TO REPLACE THE VEHICLE BECAUSE I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE FOR MY MOTHER BECAUSE IT HAS A 5-STAR SAFETY RATING AND IT IS NO LONGER SAFE FOR HER TO DRIVE IF SHE IS IN AN ACCIDENT AND THE BRAKES LOCK UP AND SHE SKIDS ACROSS THE HIGHWAY.",

JUST AFTER MY 1 YEAR MARK MY TRANSMISSION WENT OUT. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND FELT ASSURED AT LEAST IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY, ONLY TO FIND OUT IT, THAT IS WAS ONLY COVERED FOR 1 YEAR ON THE POWER TRAIN,  I WAS VERY DISPLEASED TO HAVE THE TRANSMISSION GO OUT WITH ONLY 50K MILES ON IT. AFTER SPEAKING WITH SEVERAL \"MANAGERS\" ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND HOW I FELT THEY SHOULD COVER IT UNDER THE WARRANTY, THEY FINALLY AGREED TO ABSORB SOME OF THE COST, I PAID 1K DOLLARS FOR THE TRANSMISSION, WHILE MY CAR WAS BEING WORKED ON THEY DID THE SERVICE THAT IT WAS DUE SUCH AS ROTATING TRIES ETC. ON MY WAY HOME FROM THE DEALER MY AIR CONDITIONING  STOPPED WORKING :(  NOW IT WORKS OFF AND ON,  THEN A DAY LATER MY LOW TIRE SENSOR COMES ON, SHOWING MY TIRE PRESSURE SYSTEM IS FAULTY.  REALLY??? NOW WHEN I MAKE A LEFT TURN, MY  TRACTION CONTROL/ABS WARRING LIGHTS COME ON AND DING.  WOW WHY AS THIS CAR NOT BEEN RECALLED FOR ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS I NOW FIND SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVING SAME ISSUES TO THE TEE,  THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THESE CARS.  NOW I REMEMBER WHY MY 3 PREVIOUS VEHICLES HAVE BEEN TOYOTA AND HONDA'S   I PAID 5K DOWN ALL THE MONEY I HAD BUY A CERTIFIED CAR THINKING IT WOULD LAST ME LONGER THAN 1 YEAR.  I WAS WRONG AND I OWE MORE ON IT NOW THAT I AM SURE IT IS WORTH.   *TR",

I GOT OFF THE EXIT AND EXAMINED THE VEHICLE ENSURING THAT NO TIRES WERE FLAT AND THAT NO LUG NUTS WERE LOOSE. I DID NOTICE THAT THE RIMS FELT EXTREMELY HOT BUT SEEING AS I HAD DRIVEN ON THE HIGHWAY, THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT. I CALLED ONSTAR TO DO A DIAGNOSIS AND WAS INFORMED THAT TWO TIRES WERE A LITTLE LOW. I CONTINUED TO WORK AND RETURNED HOME WITH NO INCIDENT. AFTER WORK ON THE SAME DAY WE WERE ON OUR WAY TO DO SOME SHOPPING AND AS SOON AS THE VEHICLE WAS TURNED ON, THE 2 STABILITRAK LIGHTS DID NOT TURN OFF. WE CALLED ONSTAR AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE STABILITRAK BUT NOT BRAKES AND THAT IT SHOULD BE SERVICED WITHIN THE NEXT 7 DAYS. I DID SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AND SAW THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SAME ISSUE WITH THE DEALERS NOT KNOWING HOW TO RESOLVE IT BUT CHARGING CONSUMERS ANYWAYS. I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS IS GOING THE SAME ROUTE AS THE IGNITION RECALL AND IS GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN A DECADE BEFORE THE ISSUE IS ADDRESSED.

ALTHOUGH I DID NOT CRASH OR SUSTAIN AN INJURY, IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE I GOT LUCKY AND HAD A SAFE PLACE TO TURN INTO.

ONE CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE SHOCK STRIKE WHICH LEAVES A DULL ACHING PAIN IN A FINGER ON MY LEFT HAND. WE HAVE TRIED SEAT COVERS, STATIC GUARD, DRYER SHEETS, BUT NOTHING SOLVES OR LESSENS THE ISSUE.

        "summary": "ON 9/24/08 I PURCHASED A 2008 SATURN VUE XR AWD WITH 5945 MILES ON IT AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. IT WAS A CORPORATE FLEET VEHICLE PRIOR TO MY PURCHASE. IT HAS A \"PREFERRED PACKAGE\" INCLUDING A FACTORY-INSTALLED REMOTE START.  IN THE SHORT 4 MONTHS I OWN IT I HAVE EXPERIENCED A PROBLEM WITH THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER PANEL AT LEAST 10 TIMES OR MORE. SPECIFICALLY, THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER DISPLAY DOES NOT ILLUMINATE AT ALL.  NO SPEEDOMETER, NO FUEL GAGE, RPM'S OR TURN SIGNALS YET THE VEHICLE IS IN DRIVE AND RUNNING.  WHAT I'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING TYPICALLY HAPPENS WHEN I USE THE REMOTE KEYLESS ENTRY (RKE) TO REMOTE START THE VEHICLE & PARTICULARLY WHEN IT'S EXTREMELY COLD OR THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN SITTING OVERNIGHT FOR SEVERAL HOURS. I REMOTE START THE VEHICLE THEN WITHIN 6-8 MINUTES I ENTER THE VEHICLE USING THE UNLOCK KEY ON THE REMOTE. I PUT THE KEY IN THE IGNITION AND TURN IT TO THE \"ON\" POSITION WHICH SHOULD THEN ALLOW THE VEHICLE TO OPERATE NORMALLY ONCE IT IS PUT IN GEAR.  MY VEHICLE'S INSTRUMENT CLUSTER PANEL IS COMPLETELY DARK WITH NO DISPLAY WHATSOEVER YET THE VEHICLE IS RUNNING AND IN MOTION. ONE DAY I TRIED TO REMOTE START IT AS I USUALLY DO BUT IT WOULD NOT WORK EVEN THOUGH I WAS IN RANGE AND THEN WHEN I PUT THE KEY IN THE IGNITION IT STILL WOULD NOT START.  ON ANOTHER DAY I WAS DRIVING WHEN SUDDENLY THE DASHBOARD JUST WENT COMPLETELY BLACK FOR ABOUT 5 SECONDS AND THEN CAME BACK ON AGAIN. I HAVE BROUGHT MY VUE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP 3 TIMES ALREADY AND THEY SAY THEY CANNOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT THEY CAN DO. I JUST HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL IT HAPPENS AGAIN. UNACCEPTABLE RESPONSE ON SATURN/GM'S BEHALF. I KNOW THERE IS AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM BUT THEY WON'T LISTEN TO ME. I HAVE ALSO HAD A CONTROL ARM BUSHING REPLACED ALREADY. THE REAR WINDSHIELD WASHER FLUID DOES NOT COME OUT WHICH THEY SAY WAS CLOGGED & FIXED. THANKS TO NHTSA'S WEBSITE I WAS ABLE TO FIND A POWER STEERING RECALL THAT THE DEALER DIDN'T ADDRESS - MY ENTIRE RESERVOIR NEEDED REPLACEMENT. *TR",
