        "summary": "I HAVE HAD SIX BLOW OUTS OR TIRE FAILURES ON GOODYEAR \"MARATHON\" TRAILER TIRES IN 15,000 MILES!!! THE TIRES WERE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT ON A 2002 22' HAULMARK ENCLOSED AEROSTAR TRAILER. THE TIRE SIZE IS: ST 225/ 75 R- 15. THE CATASTROPHIC FAILURES HAVE BEEN MOSTLY WITH THE SIDE WALLS BLOWING OUT AND ONE WITH THE TREAD BELT COMING OFF. I AM METICULOUS WITH KEEPING THE PROPER INFLATION AND HAVE VARIED IT BETWEEN 65-55 LBS. THE TRAILER IS NOT OVERLOADED (3,500 LBS.) WITH TANDEM HEAVY-DUTY AXLES. THE FAILURES HAVE BEEN ON ALL FOUR TIRE POSITIONS, THERE WAS NO UNUSUAL TIRE WEAR PATTERNS. THE TRAILER MANUFACTOR DENIES ANY PROBLEMS THERE AWARE OFF. THE LAST FAILURE OCCURED ON DEC. 17TH 2004 JUST AFTER STARTING A TRIP 10 MILES FROM MY HOME ON INTERSTATE 75. THE FAILURE PREVIOUS TO THAT OCCURED ON WEEK EARLIER WITH A TIRE HAVING ABOUT 1,000 MILES ON IT. THE FAILURE PRIOR TO THAT WAS NOV. 24, 2004 ON A BRAND NEW TIRE WITH 100 MILES ON IT!!! I HAVE NOT HIT ANY ROAD HAZARDS OR OBSTICLES.THE OTHER TIRES ALL HAD NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF PUNCTURES, MOST WITH UNDER 5,000 MILES. THIS IS NOT BY COINCIDENCE THAT ALL THESE BLOWOUTS ARE OCCURING!!! ALLIED TIRE IN OCALA,FL. (SHELBY) WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO ADMIT HE HAS SEEN A PROBLEM WITH THESE TIRES WITH CUSTOMERS AND NOW USES CARLIELES. THESE BLOWOUTS HAVE COST ME MUCH INCONVEINENCE AND TRIP INTERUPTIONS NOT TO MENTION THE SAFTY HAZARD AND EXPENSE.EVERYTIME ONE BLOWS IT COST ME OVER A HUNDRED DOLLARS. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE (RECALL) BEFORE PEOPLE ARE INJURED OR KILLED.  I NOW CARRY TWO SPARES AND AM NOT BUYING ANYMORE GOODYEAR TRAILER TIRES. PLEASE RELAY THIS MESSAGE TO GOODYEAR. THANK YOU. *AK",
