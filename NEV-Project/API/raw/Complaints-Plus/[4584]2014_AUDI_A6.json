        "summary": "Audi sent a notice in June 2021 regarding the issuance of a limited extended warranty coverage for Electromechanical Steering Unit for certain 2011-2016 model year A4, A4 Allroad, A5, S5, RS5, Q5, SQ5, A6, S6, A7, RS7, A8, and S8 vehicles. The letter stated that \"Audi has determined that it is possible for the Electromechanical steering unit to malfunction in some vehicles, causing the electromechanical steering warning lamp in the instrument cluster to illuminate due to the presence of specific fault codes resulting from this malfunction.\" The letter provided consumers with repairs under warranty, but was unclear about requiring the repairs to be completed at an Audi authorized facility. The letter implies that the issue is the illumination of the warning lamp on the instrument panel, but fails to warn consumers of the actual impact to the usability of the vehicle when the fault is triggered.  I experienced first hand that the illumination of the light renders the car inoperable as the power steering mechanism no longer works and the vehicle is nearly impossible to steer and control. The warning also directs the driver to drive to the nearest Audi repair center, which is not feasible given the difficulties to steer. The nearest facility was also 15 miles away. After attempting to drive home, the instrument panel warned me to stop driving the car. In less than 1/2 mile the instruction on the panel went from drive to nearest facility to stop driving. The warning for this fault and subsequent loss of steering happens instantaneously. The driver is unable to do much, but to safely pull over into an area that the car can be towed from.  Moreover, I repaired the vehicle at a local dealership and Audi refuses to reimburse me as their forms lead me to believe it would be. Audi should have issued a recall to correct a problem that they were aware poses a significant safety concern instead of extended warranty with stipulations carved out. Please help me make this right.",

THE STEERING WHEEL COMPLETELY LOCKED AND I HAD NO ABILITY TO TURN THE WHEEL.  I COASTED DOWN A HILL AND THE WHEEL UNLOCKED, BUT I HAD NO POWER STEERING AND STILL NO ABILITY TO ACCELERATE.  I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR INTO A PARKING LOT AND HAD IT TOWED TO THE TUCSON ARIZONA AUDI DEALER.  THEY HAVE YET TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.  THEY REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP TWICE AND TRIED TO RUN THE VEHICLE BUT CAN'T KEEP IT RUNNING FOR MORE THAN 2 MINUTES.  THE CAR KEEPS \"SEIZING\" UP IS WHAT THE SERVICE SHOP TELLS ME.  THEY STILL CAN'T FIX IT AND THE CAR ONLY HAS JUST OVER 5,000 MILES ON IT.  *TT",

CONSUMER WRITES IN REGARDS TO A LOUD SCREECHING NOISE WHEN BRAKES ARE APPLIED.  *SMD  THE CONSUMER ALSO STATED THERE WAS SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE TAIL PIPE, AND WHEN SHE PARKED THE VEHICLE IN THE GARAGE, SMOKE FILLED THE ENTIRE GARAGE.  THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP. AN INSPECTION REVEALED A PLASTIC BAG WAS CAUGHT IN THE VENT PIPE AND MELTED, WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF THE SMOKE AND SMELL COMING FROM THE VEHICLE. AS TO THE SCREECHING SOUND WHEN THE BRAKE WAS APPLIED, THE CONSUMER WAS INFORMED THAT SMALL SOUNDS WERE HEARD AND THE BRAKE PADS WERE CLEANED.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT SUGGESTED, THE VEHICLE BE DRIVEN MORE AND THAT SHOULD SOLVE THE OXIDATION PROBLEM. THE CONSUMER DROVE THE VEHICLE MORE OFTEN. HOWEVER AS SHE PERIODICALLY SLOWED DOWN, THERE WAS A SCREECHING SOUND, EVEN LOUDER THAN EVER BEFORE.  *JB",
