ACURA HAS STATED THAT ALL OF THEIR TRANSMISSIONS MAKE THIS CLICKING NOISE ALL THE TIME, HOWEVER IT IS NOT NORMAL FOR AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS TO DO THIS AND NO OTHER CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED MAKES THIS NOISE.  I'VE ALSO DONE MY RESEARCH AND ALL ACURA TSX AUTOMATIC OWNERS FROM THE 04-08 MODEL YEARS EXPERIENCE THIS CLICKING PROBLEM.  THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE A BAD SHIFT LOCK SOLENOID AND BUSHING.  SOME OWNERS HAVE HAD ACURA FIX THE PROBLEM ONLY FOR IT TO COME BACK IN 10K - 20K MILES.  THERE SHOULD BE AN INVESTIGATION INTO A RECALL FOR THIS.  I AM SURE IT COULD LEAD TO MORE ISSUES WITH THE CAR FURTHER ON.  *TR",
