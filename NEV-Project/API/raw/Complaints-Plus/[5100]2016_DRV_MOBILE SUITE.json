WE PROCEEDED DOWN THE ROAD AND AT LEAST 7 OR 8 TIMES DURING OUR 2 HOUR ROAD TRIP WE HAD TO STOP AND RETRACT THE FRONT HYDRAULIC LEVELERS.  ON THE LAST THREE TIMES ONE OF THE LEVELERS WAS ALL THE WAY DOWN TOUCHING THE ROAD REALLY SCARING US TO THE POINT WHERE WE CALLED OUR DRV DEALER AND SEE IF IT WAS SAFE TO DRIVE.  WE DID RETRACT THE LEVELERS ON THE LAST TIME AND THEY SEEMED TO STAY UP UNTIL WE GOT HOME.  I HAVE CHECK SEVERAL DRV USER WEB SITES AND THIS SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM A LOT OF OWNERS ARE HAVING.  I CONTACTED LIPPERT THE MANUFACTURER OF THE HYDRAULIC LEVELERS AND THEY WOULD NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE FIXED OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN OUT OF WARRANTY,  OUR VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY AT OUR DRV DEALER IN KNOXVILLE, TN  *BF*AS*JB*DT*JB",
