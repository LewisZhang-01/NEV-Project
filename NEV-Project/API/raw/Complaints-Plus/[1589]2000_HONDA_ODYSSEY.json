THIS REPLACEMENT ODYSSEY TRANSMISSION FAILED AFTER SUNSET AT ABOUT 7:00 PM ON AN UNLIT TWO LANE COUNTRY ROAD WITH LITTLE ROOM OR OPPORTUNITY TO PARK SAFELY.   MY HUSBAND, WHO IS ALMOST 70 YEARS OLD WAS DRIVING AND WITH NO GEARS BARELY MANAGED TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  IT WAS STILL DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE ROAD, BUT FORTUNATELY ANOTHER DRIVER STOPPED AND HELPED MY HUSBAND PUSH THE ODYSSEY A FEW EXTRA FEET TO A SLIGHTLY SAFER AREA.  WE WERE ABOUT 100 YARDS FROM A CURVE WHERE APPROACHING CARS COULD NOT SEE US UNTIL THEY WERE ALMOST UPON US.  THE ONLY PROTECTION WE HAD WAS OUR EMERGENCY FLASHERS.   WE WERE APPROXIMATELY FIVE MILES FROM OUR HOME IN A VERY RURAL AREA WITH NO CLOSE SERVICES.  WE HAD TO WAIT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR ALMOST TWO HOURS FOR A TOW TRUCK TO ARRIVE. IT WAS A VERY DANGEROUS AND FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE.     SINCE WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN METICULOUS IN DEALER RECOMMENDED AND PROVIDED MAINTENANCE, I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT INADEQUATE AND/OR SHODDY HONDA REPLACEMENTS PARTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS FAILURE.  THAT FAILURE PUT BOTH MY HUSBAND AND MYSELF IN A DISTURBING AND PERILOUS SITUATION.  *TR",

AFTER THE FIRST ONE FAILED AT 62K MILES, THE DEALER ASSURED ME THAT HONDA HAD FIXED THE ISSUES AND THAT THE REPLACEMENT WOULD NOT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.  WOO HOO FOR HONDA!  THEY ACKNOWLEDGED A PROBLEM, FIXED IT, AND TOOK MEASURES TO ADDRESS IT AT NO COST TO THE CUSTOMER.  THEY SCORED BIG POINTS WITH THAT MOVE...

WHEN I BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DEALER THIS TIME, I QUESTIONED HIM OVER AND OVER AGAIN ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE TRANSMISSION THEY WERE ABOUT TO INSTALL.  HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT SOME OF THE EARLY REPLACEMENTS DID STILL HAVE PROBLEMS, BUT HONDA REALLY HAD FIXED THEM THIS TIME.  I TOOK HIS WORD FOR IT, BUT SURE ENOUGH, 38K MILES LATER, THAT ONE FAILED TOO.  HOW CAN HONDA CONTINUE TO GET AWAY WITH INSTALLING THESE FAULTY REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSIONS?  I'M NOW LOOKING AT THE WORK ORDER FOR THE FOURTH TRANSMISSION AND IT LISTS THE PART NUMBER AS '06200-P7T-030RM  WARRANTY A/T KIT'.

THEY KEEP TELLING ME THEY'VE FIXED THE PROBLEMS, BUT THE PART NUMBER STAYS THE SAME AND THE OUTCOME DOESN'T CHANGE?  THIS IS FRAUD.

I LIFTED THE CAR AND INSPECTED IT MYSELF AFTER I THEN SAW A LEAK. I WAS GOING TO SIMPLY REPLACE THE DRIVERSIDE AXLE SEAL TO SOLVE THE LEAK PROBLEM. BUT I FOUND A MUCH MORE SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM WAS BUILD INTO THIS CAR, THAT THE MFG IS RESPONSIBLE FOR. THE LEFT SIDE INNER SHAFT AT THE TRANSMISSION SEAL AREA WAS LOOSE. (I WIGGLED IT BY HAND). I FOUND THAT WHEN DRIVEN IT SPILLS FLUID AT A RATE OF 1/2 QUART PER DAY, AT THE SEAL. I CAN'T AFFORD TO CONTINUE TO PURCHASE AT $5000.0 AND SIMULTANEOUSLY PAY $5025 FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION. HONDA AMERICA SAID \"THAT THE DIFFERENTIAL IS THE PROBLEM, YOU CAN PUT SEALS IN IT ALL DAY AND THAT WON'T FIX IT, IT MUST BE REPLACED\".  TODAY 07/30/10 IT STOPPED FORWARD MOTION ON A HILL. I TURNED ON MY FLASHER AND ROLLED 3 BLOCKS BACKWARDS DOWN THE HILL TO A SAFE LEVEL AREA. I CARRY LOTS OF TRANSMSN FLUID NOW AND ADD A QUART A DAY  TILL I CAN COME UP WITH AN OUT. I CAN'T JUST SELL THE CAR TO SOMEONE ELSE, IT'S JUST NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO.AND I MUST GET TO WORK IM THINKING ABOUT BUYING A USED ONE AT THE JUNK YARD. THE SCARY THING IS DID HONDA EVER PUT OUT A TRANSMISSION THAT WORKS RIGHT T? OR HAVE THEY SIMPLY ABANDONED THERE BRAIN CHILD. I WAS LUCKY TO NOT HAVE BEEN HIT BY ANOTHER VEHICLE IN TODAY'S SITUATION. THIS IS AN UNSAFE SITUATION, THAT I FIND MY SELF IN NOW. ONE OTHER THING. HONDA SAID MY TRANS FLUID WAS REDDISH BROWN WHEN THEY INSPECTED IT. BUT THE DAY BEFORE THIS JIFFY LUBE REPLACED ALL OF THE FLUID WITH NEW AND CHARGED ME $122.00. THIS IS WHY I FIND IT HARD TO TRUST ALL OF WHAT HONDA SAYS. HOW CAN NEW TRANS FLUID BE REDDISH BROWN? (OLD). I THINK THEY DOCTOR THERE INSPECTION REPORTS IN ANTICIPATION OF GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS. THEY ALSO SAID THE SUBFRAME WAS BENT, BUT DIDN'T ADD HOW THAT MIGHT AFFECT THE CAR.

I HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO THE HONDA DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE.  AS THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON, I WAS TOLD TO JUST IGNORE IT, AS IT MUST HAVE COME ON AFTER FILLING UP GAS, AND NOT TO WORRY, AS IT WILL GO OFF AUTOMATICALLY.     FINALLY I TOLD THEM TO CHECK THE CODES, AND NOW THEY TELL ME IT NEEDS A NEW TRANSMISSION, BUT TO CONTINUE DRIVING IT, AS JUST BECAUSE THE LIGHT IS ON, THE TRANSMISSION IS NOT \"DEAD\" AND TO CONTINUE DRIVING UNTIL I  NOTICE ANY PROBLEMS.  WELL, AFTER A 4HR ROAD TRIP, THE ENGINE LIGHT AND TCS LIGHT CAME ON, AND I DIDN'T REALIZE THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM, UNTIL I STOPPED AND HAD TO MAKE A LT HAND TURN.  AS I STEPPED ON THE GAS TO ENTER THE INTERSECTION, THE VAN HESITATED, AND THEN JERKED FORWARD.  HAD THE DELAY BEEN ANY LONGER, MY FAMILY AND MYSELF WOULD HAVE BEEN IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.    I REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION AT HONDA, AND NOW 18MONTHS LATER, IT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AGAIN.  HONDA IS WELL AWARE OF THIS TRANSMISSION ISSUE, AND SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPAIRING THIS PROBLEM ONCE AND FOR ALL.  WHY KEEP REPLACING A TRANSMISSION KNOWING IT WILL ONLY LAST ANOTHER UNDER 2YRS.  MY ONLY OPTION IS TO SELL THIS VAN, BUT IT'S NOT FARE TO THE NEXT UNFORTUNATE PERSON.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD. *TR",

THIS IS A QUOTE FROM POPULAR MECHANICS THAT DESCRIBES MY PROBLEM BETTER THAN I COULD:     \"MOST CARS AND A LOT OF TRUCKS TODAY ARE MANUFACTURED WITH HEADLAMP ASSEMBLIES THAT USE QUARTZ-HALOGEN BULBS PLUGGED INTO THE BACK OF A LARGE PLASTIC REFLECTOR. THE OUTER SURFACE OF THESE HEADLAMP MODULES IS MOLDED POLYCARBONATE PLASTIC. THAT PLASTIC IS MUCH LIGHTER THAN GLASS AND FAR MORE RESISTANT TO STONE CHIPS AND CRACKS. HOWEVER, AFTER A FEW YEARS OF EXPOSURE TO SUNLIGHT AND ATMOSPHERIC CHEMICALS, POLYCARBONATE HAS A TENDENCY TO GET HAZY.\"    RECENTLY I THOUGHT ONE OF MY HEADLAMPS HAD GONE OUT ON MY 2000 HONDA ODYSSEY. TURNED OUT THE PLASTIC HEADLAMP COVER IS WAS JUST A TOTAL HAZE & MESS AND REALLY KNOCKING DOWN THE LAMP LIGHT.  I SUSPECT THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT FROM MY HEADLIGHT IS DIMINISHED BY AT LEAST 50 PERCENT, MAYBE MORE.    LOOKING AT OTHER VARIOUS OTHER CARS ON A TRIP THROUGH A PARKING LOT SHOWS TONS OF OTHERS WITH IDENTICAL PROBLEMS. NOT A HARD PROBLEM TO CONFIRM.    SO MY QUESTION IS: WHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT PERMIT CAR MAKERS TO USE PLASTIC FOR HEADLAMP COVERS WHEN EVERY SINGLE CAR WILL, IN TIME, HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISHED HEADLIGHT OUTPUT AS A RESULT OF THIS HAZY BUSINESS?  SEEMS WE'RE PUTTING EVERYBODY AT RISK JUST TO SAVE A FEW BUCKS.  THIS IS CLEARLY A SAFETY ISSUE.    THE SIMPLE, RATIONAL, INTELLIGENT SOLUTION SEEMS TO GO BACK TO REQUIRING GLASS HEADLAMP COVERS.  PROBLEM SOLVED.    THANKS FOR LISTENING! *TR",

WHEN I RESEARCHED THIS, I FOUND THAT NUMEROUS PEOPLE HAVE HAD TRANSMISSION ISSUES WITH HONDA VANS.  WE INQUIRED ABOUT GETTING IT FIXED UNDER WARRANTY BUT WERE TOLD THAT WE WERE OUTSIDE OF THE 93 MONTH PARAMETER.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE PREVIOUS OWNER HAD NO ISSUES WITH THE TRANSMISSION AND THEREFORE DID NOT NEED TO CHANGE THE TRANSMISSION UNDER WARRANTY (SERVICE BULLETIN 02-062).  WE WILL NOW HAVE TO PAY $3500 FOR A TRANSMISSION THAT SHOULD BE RECALLED AND SHOULD BE REPLACED NO MATTER THE TIME FRAME.

ISSUE STARTED ARISING A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE FLUSH AND IT BECAME A PROBLEM.  TOOK IT TO THE MECHANIC AGAIN AND FOUND OUT IT WAS A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM.  THE CAR CURRENTLY HAS ROUGHLY CLOSE TO 82K MILES AND DEALERSHIP STATED THIS IS OUT OF THE EXTENDED 7YR WARRANTY PHASE.  I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT THIS VEHICLE IS UNDER THE CLASS LAWSUIT FOR '99-'01 ODYSSEY MODEL (HTTP://WWW.HONDATRANSMISSIONSETTLEMENT.COM/PHP/LOGIN.PHP), WHICH EXTENDS THE WARRANTY TO 109K MILES.  HOWEVER, MANLY HONDA OF SANTA ROSA DENIED COVERAGE AND IT WOULD COST ~$4K FOR REPAIR.  WE ONLY USE THE ODYSSEY FOR WEEKEND FAMILY DRIVES OR PICK UP FURNITURE/SUPPLIES FROM COSTCO.  I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT HONDA WOULD BE CONSIDERATE AND VEHICLE VERY STURDY, BUT NOW I WOULD HAVE TO THINK TWICE BEFORE PURCHASING ANOTHER HONDA.  P.S.

DISASSEMBLY OF THE FRONT LEFT WHEEL ALLOWED FOR THE EVALUATION OF THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE BROKEN COIL SPRING.

ALTHOUGH, THIS IS WHAT ROSENTHAL HAD PORTRAYED IT AS) ABOUT THE REPAIR AND THAT IT WAS NOT COVERED.  THEY TOLD ME THAT I COULD CALL THE WARRANTY COMPANY TO COMPLAIN IF I FELT SO INCLINED TO DO.    I CALLED THE WARRANTY COMPANY AND THEY SAID THAT THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED BECAUSE OF THE MILEAGE.  THE VEHICLE IS JUST OVER 75,063 MILES.  THEY DID NOT CARE THAT THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED.      MY QUESTION IS HOW CAN THIS BE A NON-RECALL ISSUE IF A NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  THIS SITUATION IS THE EXACT REASON WHY I PURCHASED HONDA'S EXTENDED WARRANTY.  I BELIEVE THAT HONDA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIR.  IF I HAD KNOW THE DOORS ON THIS VEHICLE WOULD COST THAT MUCH TO FIX I WOULD HAVE NEVER PURCHASED THAT VAN. *JB",

I PUT IT INTO \"PARK\" AND IT SLOWED DOWN IMMEDIATELY.       HONDA USA  INFORMED  ME THAT THEY CAN'T HELP ME.  IF THE PROBLEM ISN'T DUPLICABLE IN THEIR SHOP(S), IT CAN'T BE DIAGNOSED.      I AM TERRIFIED FOR THE LIVES OF MY 2 CHILDREN THAT FREQUENTLY DRIVE WITH ME.         PLEASE UNDERSTAND:  ONCE YOU ARE ABLE TO STOP THE VAN, AND PUT IT INTO PARK, IT NO LONGER REVS OR FEELS LIKE IT WANTS TO TAKE OFF.   THE PROBLEM VANISHES ONCE I STOP AT A DEALERSHIP.  IT OCCURS ONLY SPORADICALLY.        I NOTICED AT LEAST TWO SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ON YOUR SITE; ONE DATED JULY 18, 2001, ANOTHER JUNE 12, 2000.",

I ASKED \"IF YOU'VE SEEN IT BEFORE, HOW COME THERE'S NOT A RECALL ON THIS PROBLEM?\", AND THEY SAID TO TALK TO THE MANAGER (WHO WASN'T THERE AT THE TIME), AND HE NEVER RETURNED MY CALL. ANYWAY, I NEVER GOT THE REPAIR DONE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE. THEN THE NEXT WEEK MY OTHER DOOR STARTED BUZZING CONTINUOUSLY, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS CLOSED ALL THE WAY. THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THAT BUZZING WAS TO DISABLE THE DOOR ENTIRELY (USING THE DASHBOARD DOOR SWITCH). FOR SOME REASON, THAT PROBLEM STOPPED ALL BY ITSELF ABOUT A WEEK AFTER IT STARTED, AND HASN'T COME BACK....BUT I'M STILL STUCK WITH THE DOOR FROM HELL ON THE OTHER SIDE. SINCE THEN, I'VE GONE TO OTHER CAR COMPLAINT WEBSITES AND SEEN JUST HOW COMMON THIS PROBLEM IS WITH ODYSSEY SLIDING DOORS, AND THAT EVEN WHEN PEOPLE GET THE PROBLEM FIXED, IT SOMETIMES RETURNS WITH THE NEW INSTALLED EQUIPMENT TOO -- REQUIRING ANOTHER FIX FOR $700.

THE CAR IS ONLY THREE YEARS OLD AND HAD ONLY 65,000 MILES ON IT--TOO SOON TO NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION. AFTER SOME RESEARCH, I DISCOVERED THAT HONDA HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THEIR TRANSMISSIONS AND THE HONDA DEALER I TOOK IT TO ADMITTED AS MUCH. TO FIX THIS KNOWN DEFECT IN THEIR VEHICLES, HONDA HAS EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON TRANSMISSIONS ON MANY OF THEIR CARS INCLUDING MY YEAR MODEL AND MAKE. SO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAID THAT HONDA WOULD REPLACE MY TRANSMISSION FOR FREE.  HOWEVER, WHEN THEY PULLED UP MY VIN I WAS GIVEN THE UNFORTUNATE NEWS THAT MY CAR HAS A CANADIAN VIN--A SUPPOSED \"GREY MARKET VEHICLE\" AND THAT HONDA VOIDS THE WARRANTY ON THESE VEHICLES.  I HAD NEVER EVEN HEARD OF A GREY MARKET VEHICLE.  SO EVEN THOUGH MY HONDA ODYSSEY WAS MADE IN THE EXACT SAME CANADIAN PLANT WITH THE EXACT SAME SUB STANDARD TRANSMISSION AS THE CARS THEY ARE REPLACING TRANSMISSIONS ON, HONDA REFUSED TO PAY FOR MY TRANSMISSION. THIS IS IN MY OPINION A SAFETY-RELATED DEFECT; WHEN MY TRANSMISSION WAS SLIPPING, MY CAR WAS COMPLETELY UNRELIABLE IN ACCELERATION. I WAS SO AFRAID THAT I WOULD PULL OUT IN FRONT OF SOMEONE OR BE TURNING AND MY CAR WOULDN'T GO AND THEY WOULD CRASH INTO MY VAN WITH MY TWO SMALL CHILDREN IN THE BACK.  THANK GOD MY HUSBAND AND I WERE ABLE TO AFFORD THE $3200 BILL FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO DRIVE MY UNSAFE VEHICLE MORE THAN 2 WEEKS (ALTHOUGH THAT WAS TOO LONG IF YOU ASK ME). BUT I KNOW THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WITH THESE FAULTY TRANSMISSIONS WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO GET THEM FIXED RIGHT AWAY, SO THEY JUST DRIVE THE CAR UNTIL THEY CAN AFFORD A NEW ONE. IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE TO HAVE THOSE PEOPLE ON THE ROAD. TO ME, HONDA SHOULD RECALL THESE TRANSMISSIONS; THEY ARE AN OBVIOUS THREAT TO EVERYONE'S SAFETY ON THE ROAD. THANK YOU.    *CB",

THE GENERAL PROBLEM IS THAT I NEED TO GO ALL THE WAY TO CANADA FROM SEATTLE TO GET IT FIXED.  MY WIFE AND I PURCHASED OUR 2000 HONDA ODYSSEY EX FOUR MONTHS AGO WITH 29,000 MILES ON IT.  THE VAN WAS PURCHASED FROM A PRIVATE PARTY WHO HAD BOUGHT IT WITH 192 MILES ON IT FROM A DEALER.  WITH THE PURCHASE CAME AN EXTENDED WARRANTY LEADING US TO ASSUME THAT WE WOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF IF THE HONDA ODYSSEY EX HAD ANY SERIOUS PROBLEMS.  I THINK OF A BROKEN SEATBELT THAT HOLDS IN MY CHILDREN AS A SERIOUS PROBLEM.  MY REGULAR MECHANIC TOLD ME TO TAKE IT TO A DEALER BECAUSE HE SAID HONDA HAS A LIFETIME WARRANTEE ON THEIR SEATBELTS.  MY EXTENDED WARRANTEE COMPANY (HERITAGE) DOES NOT COVER SEATBELTS OR AIRBAGS BUT INSISTED THAT HONDA SHOULD.  WE TOOK IT TO A HONDA DEALER (BURIEN HONDA) WHO SAID THAT SEATBELTS ARE ALWAYS COVERED BY HONDA.  THEY TOOK MY INFO AND SAID THEY WOULD ORDER THE PARTS.  A FEW HOURS LATER I GOT A CALL FROM THE DEALER STATING THAT BECAUSE THE CAR HAS A VIN INDICATING IT WAS PURCHASED IN CANADA IT WAS NOT COVERED.   I THEN CALLED HONDA (IN AMERICA) CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER THEY WERE NICE BUT TOLD ME THAT CARS SOLD IN CANADA ARE NOT COVERED BY HONDA  WE DID NOT KNOW THE VEHICLE WAS FROM CANADA, ALTHOUGH THAT SHOULD NOT MATTER.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT ALL 2000 HONDA ODYSSEYS WERE MADE IN CANADA AND ALL HAVE THE SAME FAMILIAR HONDA LOGO ON THE HOOD.  I CAN NOT IMAGINE SEAT BELTS BEING VERY DIFFERENT BETWEEN CANADA AND AMERICA.   IN AN AUTO ACCIDENT, SOMEONE COULD GET INJURED OR EVEN KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS BROKEN SEATBELT.   THIS WEEK, WE GO TO CANADA.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP,  MARC, NATALIE AND MADISON \u0013IT\u0012S MY SEAT BELT THAT IS BROKEN\u0014 MCCANN. *AK",

AMERICAN HONDA DID AGREE TO PAY FOR THE PART, OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THEY FELT THAT THE PART SHOULD OT HAVE FAILED, BUT THE DEALERSHIP IS NOT WILLING TO INSTALL IT AT NO CHARGE.  I WILL TAKE THE ISSUE UP WITH THEM AGAIN.  RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED,  RUSSELL CHASON *AK",

THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT WAS THE TRANSMISSION FAILURE WITH ONLY 6,000 MILES ON THE ODYESSY. I WAS SOUTHBOUND ON EUCLID AVE. AT INTERSTATE 5. I WAS STOPPED AT A RED LIGHT IN A UPHILL POSITION. I WAS THE FIRST VEHICLE AT THE LIGHT. WHEN THE LIGHT TURN GREEN, I PROCEEDED TO GO AND MY ODYSSEY TRANSMISSION SLIPPED AND THEN CAUGHT AND THEN THE ENGINE STALLED OUT. THIS CAUSED THE ODYSSEY TO LURCH FORWARD AND THEN STOP SUDDENLY. WHEN THE ODYSSEY STOPPED I STILL HAD MY FOOT ON THE GAS TO GO SO THAT NO BRAKE LIGHTS CAME ON TO WARN THE DRIVERS TO MY REAR THAT MY  VEHICLE WAS ABOUT TO STOP. MY ODYSSEY WAS HIT IN THE REAR BUMPER BY THE VEHICLE TO MY REAR. THE ACCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE ANAHEIM POLICE WHO CAME TO THE SCENE AND MADE REPORT # DR NO 00-23199. THE VEHICLE TO MY REAR WAS WITHOUT INSURANCE. I REPORTED THIS ACCIDENT TO HONDA OF AMERICA AND THE CALLED ME BACK TO INFORM ME THAT THEY WOULD NOT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DAMAGES TO MY VEHICLE. I HAVE NOT HAD AN APPRAISAL OF MY DAMAGES YET IT COULD BE SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS. I AM HOLDING OFF BECAUSE ON THE APPRAISAL BECAUSE THE VEHICLE BEHIND MINE HAD NO INSURANCE AND AMERICAN HONDA CLAIMS NO RESPONSIBILITY.  ON A SEPARATE INCIDENT ON JUNE 24, 2000 MY LEFT REAR TIRE BLUE OUT AT 70 MPH WITH ONLY 7,500 MILES ON IT. I CAME TO A SAFE STOP AND HAD THE TIRE REPLACED FOR $100.00 .  ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT THE BRAKES GRIND WITH A METAL TO METAL SOUND WHEN COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP.  ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT MY POWER STEERING SOMETIMES HESITATES AND JERKS.  ANOTHER PROBLEM IS WHEN RUNNING THE REAR AIRCONDITIONING ON HIGH THE REAR BLOWER SPEED FLUCTUATES LIKE AS IF IT HAS A BAD CONNECTION.  ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT I HAVE NOTICED SINCE THE COLDER WEATHER AROUND NOVEMBER, 2000 WHEN I USE THE DEFROSTER ON THE FRONT WINDOWS IT SMELLS LIKE AN ELECTRICAL FIRE, OR LIKE WIRES ARE BURNING.  *AK (DOT NUMBER: M30D  TIRESIZE: P215/65R16)",

THE VAN DID NOT DOWNSHIFT AS EXPECTED FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES, IN ORDER TO GAIN SPEED, I HAD TO PRESS THE ACCELERATOR UNTIL THE ENGINE REACHED 3K RPM, AND EVEN THEN THE TRANSMISSION NOISE CONTINUED.  IT IS NOT A CONTINUOS OCCURANCE, IT IS DOING IT EVERY FOUR TO FIVE DAYS.  I TOOK THE VAN TO THE DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT THE VAN AND SERVICE INSPECTED THE VEHICLE THROUGH A COMPUTER, WHICH DETECTED NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VAN, ALTHOUGH THE SERVICE MANAGER HAD NOTICED THE PROBLEM.  IN THE FIRST INSTANCE I WAS GIVEN THE VAN BACK WITHOUT ANYTHING DONE TO IT, EXCEPT FOR A TRANSMISSION FLUID FLUSH.  FIVE DAYS LATTER, ON APRIL 17, 2000 THE NOISE AND TRAIN PROBLEM SHOWED UP AGAIN, THIS TIME MORE SERIOUS.  I TOOK THE VAN TO ANOTHER DEALER, AND THEY PERFORMED A COMPUTER TEST THAT AGAIN SHOWED NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE, HOWEVER THE NEW SERVICE ADVISER DID NOTICE THE PROBLEM WHEN HE TOOK IT FOR A TEST DRIVE.  HONDA WAS CONTACTED AND THE COMPANY ADVICED A COMPLETE REPLACEMENT OF THE TRANSMISSION.  BEING SUCH A POPULAR MODEL THE NEEDED TRANSMISSION IS NOT AVAILABLE AND ACCORDING TO HONDA IT WILL TAKE UP TO 30 DAYS TO GET A REPLACEMENT , HOPEFULLY NEW.  ANOTHER AREA OF CONCERN IS THE BRAKE PEDAL, ONE CAN HEAR THE BOOSTER WHEN PRESSING THE PEDAL AND AT TIMES THE BRAKES DO NOT ENGAGE INMEDIATELLY.
