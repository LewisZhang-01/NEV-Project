Was on the way home on 03/24/2022 that night and was driving on 4 lane state hwy. when all of a sudden it started to cut out and the low voltage light appeared on display. I had no choice but to stop in the turning lane right before it quit running. Tried to restart and it just clicked, and dash display disappeared. Had to engage park override and manually push Durango across two lanes of oncoming traffic, luckily two men stopped to help me push it and helped stop traffic so we would not have to stop when we got it rolling. once we had it on side street I tried to restart once again, and it just clicked. Used a battery booster box to jumpstart it and with box on it would run, with box taken off it would run till battery lost voltage and engine will stop running. Luck I was only about 2 miles from my home and the men who stopped and helped pull me the rest of the way home using a tow strap. The Durango is in my driveway and will not start and run to take anywhere to be diagnosed.  Dodge told me if the vin didn't show a recall, I'd have to pay the tow bill up front and if it did turn out to be a defective alternator, I can send the tow bill in for reimbursement. (I am Disabled and can't afford a tow truck to tow it 15 miles to nearest dealership.)  The only time any warning lamps came on was just before it stopped running as I was getting in turn lane. Durango has run fine Purchased 01/19/2022 and second owner and have put only 2400 miles on it since I got it. Even took to North Central Arkansas and back to Odessa Tx in late Jan 2022 with no issues. This Alternator Part# 04801779AG was in a recall for the 2014 Durangos with a 3.6l engine recall # 14v-634 and was revised with 17v-741 I am attaching a pic of alternator part number that is still on My Durango.

I haven't contacted Dodge since this accident happened today Sunday August 1 2021. As a first responder I think this is a issue that must be addressed now by you guys since I read online that Dodge said it was not a safety concern. Mixing highway speeds with a defective headrest that is supposed to be a \"safety feature\" to prevent an whiplash effect can result in a Motor Vehicle Accident with major  injuries or including death.

NOW THE SOUND IS INCREASED AND I INFORMED MANUFACTURER THEY TOLD Y I DID NOT TELL BEFORE MY WARRANTY FOR CAR IS FINISHED, AND IF WE GO AND CHECK 2014 MODEL DURANGO THE PROBLEM OS COMMON AND THEY DONT WANT TO FIX THEY JUST WANT US TO PAY HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO REPAIR OUR OWN, THEY KNOWS THEIR CAR HAVE THESE PROBLEMS AND THEY NEVER BOTHERED. ON MY VIEW THEY HAVE TO TAKE INITIATIVE TO RECALL TO FIX. IF U GO TO COMPLAINT FORUM THERE IS LOT LIKE THIS PROBLM.

TERRIBLE DESIGN.  I HAVE READ HOURS OF FORUMS ABOUT THIS ISSUE. IT IS VERY VERY COMMON ON 2014-2019 DURANGOS. THERE IS NO FIX FOR THE ISSUE.  SOME HAVE GOTTEN EXTENDED WARRANTIES TO PAY FOR A NEW TAILLIGHT, THEN, A MONTH LATER, THEY HAVE WATER INSIDE THE LIGHT AND A BURNT OUT LIGHT AGAIN.  WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE LIGHT GOES OUT AND I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF A NASTY BLIZZARD; I CAN'T GO BUY A NEW BULB TO PUT IN IT AND I DEFINITELY CAN'T GO BUY A NEW TAILLIGHT AT $1K JUST TO HAVE IT DO THE SAME THING.

I NOTICED THE REAR TRACK LIGHTS HAD PARTS OF THE LIGHTS THAT WEREN'T LIT UP. I LOOKED CLOSER AND THERE WAS WATER IN THE LIGHTS.

I AM ASKING THAT DODGE RECOGNIZE THIS MANUFACTURING ISSUE AND DESIGN FLAW, AND HAVE THE TRACKING LIGHTING FIXED, AT NO COST TO THE VEHICLE OWNER.    I HAD FIRST CONTACTED MOPAR/DODGE CUSTOMER CARE. THE RESPONSE WAS THAT MY VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND ALSO PAST SOME UNDEFINED 'SMALL WINDOW' WHEN DODGE WOULD ASSIST WITH THE COST OF REPAIR. CUSTOMER CARE REFERENCE #74976328.    APPARENTLY DODGE DOES NOT CONSIDER THIS TO BE A MANUFACTURING DEFECT. AGAIN, I REFER TO THE HIGH NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS REGARDING THIS ISSUE THAT ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE ON-LINE. AND I HAVE ONLY MENTIONED ONE SITE. I WOULD BE INTERESTED TO KNOW HOW MANY SUCH COMPLAINTS DODGE HAS DIRECTLY RECEIVED.    THE CUSTOMER CARE EMAIL INDICATES THAT IF DODGE'S 'ON-GOING INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS' SHOW THIS TO IN FACT BE A MANUFACTURING DEFECT, THEY WILL CONTACT ME.

I WAS TRAVELING AROUND 50 MPH ON THE FREEWAY, IN THE NUMBER THREE LANE, WHEN MY CAR SHUT OFF, WHERE I LOST COMPLETE POWER TO MY ENGINE.  MY SPEEDOMETER DROPPED FROM 50 TO 30 MPH IMMEDIATELY, LEAVING ME WITH NO POWER, TO BARELY MAKE IT TO THE EMERGENCY LANE.  NO POWER,  NO BRAKE, NO STEERING-NOTHING.  MY HORN WAS ALSO HONKING, MY HEADLIGHTS FLASHING, WINDSHIELD WIPERS ATTEMPTING TO MOVE BUT UNABLE TO, AND SPEAKERS MAKING WEIRD NOISES.  AND TO MAKE THINGS EVEN MORE SCARY, MY 9 YEAR OLD SON WAS IN THE CAR WITH ME. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED, AND POSSIBLY ISSUE A RECALL.  I FEEL THAT I AM EXTREMELY LUCKY THAT MY SON AND MYSELF WERE NOT SEVERELY INJURED OR EVEN KILLED, WITH MY CAR SHUTTING OFF LIKE THAT WITHOUT WARNING.  IF I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO CRUISE TO THE EMERGENCY LANE, NO DOUBT WE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK AT A STANDSTILL BY ONCOMING TRAFFIC, AVERAGING 50-60 MPH.  I AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED, AND THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE.  I BROUGHT THE CAR INTO THE DODGE DEALERSHIP, WHERE I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS FROM THE RAIN AND IT SHORTED OUT MY ELECTRICAL. THAT'S IT.  THAT'S IT?  THERE SHOULD BE A BETTER EXPLANATION, AND ACTION TAKEN TO PREVENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS FROM EVER HAPPENING.  THAT CAR SHUTTING OFF WITHOUT WARNING FROM 50 MPH TO 0 MPH ON A FREEWAY COULD HAVE COST MY SON AND I OUR LIVES.  I AM EXPECTING TO HEAR BACK FROM DODGE REGARDING THIS VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM THAT OCCURRED, AND I HAVE ALSO READ ABOUT SIMILAR COMPLAINTS WITH THE DURANGO, SO I KNOW THIS IS NOT A FLUKE. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU.  THANK YOU.",

THEY REPLACED IT THEN BECAUSE I NOTICED THE ISSUE THE DAY I BOUGHT THE CAR AND THEY OFFERED TO FIX THE PROBLEM ON THEIR DIME SHOULD IT WORSEN.

MY MAIN CONCERN IS THAT IT WILL WORSEN AND CAUSE EITHER SAFETY INCIDENTS BECAUSE THE LIGHTS CAN'T BE SEEN AT NIGHT, OR WILL CAUSE ME TO BE CITED BY THE POLICE FOR LIGHTS BEING OUT. I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY MY DEALERSHIP THAT THE REPAIR WILL BE BETWEEN $1000 AND $1400 DOLLARS BECAUSE THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY HAS TO BE DONE TOGETHER BECAUSE IT IS MANUFACTURED THAT WAY. I UNFORTUNATELY CAN'T AFFORD TO REPLACE THE LIGHT AT THIS TIME BECAUSE OF THE PRICE.

I FOUND A YOUTUBE VIDEO, WHICH SHOWED REMOVING A FEW LIFT GATE BOLTS WOULD ALLOW THE WATER TO ESCAPE, HELPING TO LIMIT THE LOSS OF MORE OF THE LEDS INSIDE THE HOUSING. THAT WORKED, BUT IS NOT A SOLUTION TO THE DIMINISHED LIGHTING. WE NOW HAVE A SMALL SHOWER POTENTIAL WHEN STANDING UNDER OUR LIFT GATE. LIFTING THE TAILGATE REMOVES WATER, WHICH CONTINUES TO COLLECT DURING EVERY RAIN, AND EACH TIME WE WASH THE VEHICLE. LEAVING THE BOLTS IN A TRAY, INSIDE THE CABIN, SERVES TO REMIND ME OF THIS DILEMMA, AND MAY ALLOW INSECTS TO INFILTRATE THE AREA. THE WATER DAMAGE WILL ONLY INCREASE F THERE IS NO FUNCTIONING SEAL, SO AT LEAST, THIS PROVIDES AN OUTLET (BUT ONLY WHEN I LIFT THE GATE). FROM MY GOOGLE SEARCH, I LEARNED THAT THE PROBLEM HAS ALSO BEEN NOTED ON DODGE CHARGERS, AND OTHER PRODUCTS EQUIPPED WITH THIS SAME PART, AND THE FAILURE APPEARS TO STEM FROM SOME MICRO FRACTURES AT THE TOP OF THE FIXTURE.

DUE TO THE SHAPE OF THE LIGHT THE WATER ACCUMULATES IN THE BOTTOM CORNERS OF THE LIGHT AND JUST SITS THERE UNTIL A BRIGHT SUNNY DAY COMES ALONG TO EVAPORATE THE WATER.

I HAVE READ ON EVERY MOPAR, DODGE, AND DURANGO SPECIFIC COMMUNITY FORUMS AND MESSAGE BOARDS THAT THIS IS NOT A ONE OFF ISSUE. IT SEEMS THAT 90% OF DURANGO'S WITH THIS LIGHT ASSEMBLY HAVE THE SAME ISSUE. WITH SOME CASES REPORTING VISIBLE SMOKE COMING FROM THE ASSEMBLY DUE TO A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE FROM EXTENDED WATER DAMAGE, COMPLETE LIGHT FAILURE, AND MANY OTHER ISSUES CAUSED BY SHOTTY MANUFACTURING. TO HAVE THE ASSEMBLY REPLACED IS NO CHEAP VENTURE. THE LIGHT ASSEMBLY ALONE RUNS AROUND $500 OR MORE, DEPENDING ON THE CONDITION, PLUS I'M FIGURING ANOTHER $300 TO $600 IN LABOR COST ON TOP OF THE PART COST.

UPON APPROACHING THE VEHICLE, MY FATHER TOLD ME THAT THE DURANGO STARTED ROLLING BACKWARDS. THE DURANGO WAS CLEARLY IN THE 'PARKED' POSITION WITH THE \"P\" LIT UP ON THE DIAL. THE DURANGO HAD MOVED A GOOD 6-10 FEET BEFORE MY FATHER WAS ABLE TO JUMP TO THE OTHER SIDE AND STOP IT BY PRESSING THE BREAK. UPON RETURNING HOME I CHECKED ONLINE FOR OTHER COMPLAINTS SUCH AS THIS AND FOUND THAT THE NHTSA WAS INVESTIGATING CLAIMS OF THIS SAME THING HAPPENING IN 2014 DURANGO'S. THIS MORNING I CALLED MY DEALERSHIP AND THE SERVICE GUY TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL ON THE 2014 DURANGO'S (ONLY OTHER DODGE VEHICLES WITH THIS SAME EXACT PROBLEM) HE ADVISED ME THAT THE COULD TAKE A LOOK AT IT BUT THAT THERE WAS NO 'FIX' FOR IT.
