IN 9/2011, I HAD THE STEERING EXAMINED AND WAS TOLD BY THE HONDA DEALERSHIP THAT THE POWER STEERING PUMP NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND IS INOPERABLE AT LOW SPEEDS. APPARENTLY, AMERICAN HONDA ISSUED A WARRANTY EXTENSION FOR THIS ISSUE OF WHICH I WAS NOT INFORMED. THIS WARRANTY EXTENDED THE TIME FRAME FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE POWER STEERING PUMP TO 100,000 MILES OR 7 YEARS. BY 2011, I HAD 160,602 MILES ON MY VEHICLE AND WAS CLOSER TO THE 100,000 MILE MARK BACK IN 2009. IN 2012, I WAS INFORMED BY ANOTHER CAR REPAIR SHOP OF THE WARRANTY EXTENSION WITH ENCOURAGEMENT TO CALL AMERICAN HONDA. I DID AND WAS TOLD THAT I DIDN'T QUALIFY, BUT COULD FIND DOCUMENT OF THE DIAGNOSIS AND CALL BACK. IN 2015, I FIND MY RECEIPT FROM HONDA DEALERSHIP FROM 9/2011 DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM. I CALL AMERICAN HONDA. THEIR REPRESENTATIVE IS POLITE, LISTENS TO MY STORY, PLACES ME ON HOLD THEN RETURNS TO THE LINE AND TELLS ME THAT THIS WILL STILL NOT BE COVERED. I HAVE BEEN \"NEGLIGENT\" SINCE NOT CONTACTING AMERICAN HONDA BACK AFTER MY FIRST CALL IN 2012 OR HAVING THE CAR REPAIRED FOR THIS ISSUE.  OBVIOUSLY, I WANT AMERICAN HONDA TO ASSIST SINCE THIS IS NOT AN INEXPENSIVE REPAIR. I UNDERSTAND THEIR STANCE AND WISH THEY WERE MORE RESPONSIVE TO LOYAL CUSTOMERS. I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED AN ACCIDENT DUE TO THE POWER STEERING PUMP NOT WORKING CORRECTLY, BUT HAVE WORRIED AT TIMES ESPECIALLY WHEN MAKING TURNS AND BACKING OUT OF SPACES. THROUGH THIS COMPLAINT, I AM HOPING THAT FURTHER INVESTIGATION MIGHT OCCUR WHICH WILL CAUSE THE REPLACEMENT OF THE POWER STEERING PUMP TO BECOME A RECALL VERSUS A WARRANTY EXTENSION.",

THE STEERING PUMP NOISE WAS INTERMITTENT, AND OCCURRED AT LOW AND IDLE SPEEDS ONLY.  THERE WAS NEVER A LOSS OF STEERING CAPABILITY, BUT THE SHIMMY IN THE STEERING WHEEL LEADS TO DRIVER DISCOMFORT AND DRIVER FATIGUE.  HONDA HAS SINCE REPLACED THE POWER STEERING PUMP AT A REDUCED COST TO US, BUT THE NEW PUMP HAS NOT SOLVED THE STEERING WHEEL SHIMMY.  THE SHIMMY IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE EFFECTS OF A BENT WHEEL OR A OUT OF BALANCE TIRE, BUT DIFFERENT WHEELS AND DIFFERENT TIRES, IN ADDITION TO MULTIPLE TIRE RE-BALANCES HAVE FAILED TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.    THE STEERING SHIMMY OCCURS ONLY AT SPEEDS ABOVE APPROXIMATELY 62 MPH, AND SEEMS TO OCCUR AFTER ABOUT 70 - 100 MILES OF DRIVING.  WITHIN THIS DRIVING SCENARIO, THE SHIMMY CAN GET VERY BAD, AND THEN AT TIMES COMPLETELY DISAPPEAR.  BUT FOR MOST OF THE TIME, THE SHIMMY IS PRESENT.  AT SPEEDS BELOW 55 MPH, THE VEHICLE BEHAVES VERY WELL.    I'M NOT SURE IF THIS PROBLEM IS UNIQUE TO MY VEHICLE, OR IF OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME ISSUES.  IF IT IS GENERIC TO THE VEHICLE DESIGN, THEN HONDA NEEDS TO PROVIDE ODYSSEY OWNERS WITH AN ECONOMICAL SOLUTION.

WE WERE INFORMED THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH HONDA AND ACURA.  FROM MY RESEARCH THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE 1984.  THE PROBLEM WITH HONDA'S STEEL OIL PANS IS THE DRAIN PLUG THREADS ARE FREQUENTLY DAMAGED AND THE DRAIN PLUG SEALING AREA TENDS TO DISTORT.  HONDA USES AN ALUMINUM SEALING WASHER TO SEAL THE DRAIN PLUG AGAINST THE PAN.  FROM MY RESEARCH I DISCOVERED THE PROBLEM IS THE FLIMSY THREADS AND THIN SHEET METAL CAN NOT TAKE THIS AMOUNT OF TORQUE AND WILL FAIL AFTER REPEATED OIL CHANGES.      THE MECHANIC SUGGESTED A HELICOIL AS A POSSIBLE PERMANENT SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.  IF THAT DOES NOT WORK THAN ULTIMATELY I HAVE TO CHANGE THE WHOLE OIL PAN WITH OE EQUIPMENT.  THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT IS HONDA HAS NOT CORRECTED THE FLAW, SO IN A FEW YEARS I WILL BE IN THE SAME POSITION OF HAVING STRIPPED OIL PAN THREADS.  NO ONE WANTS TO DRIVE DOWN THE ROAD AND LOSE OIL PRESSURE BECAUSE THE TREADS OF THE OIL PAN HAS STRIPPED OVER TIME.

(THE CAR HAD BEEN GARAGE-KEPT UNTIL AROUND THAT TIME.) IN 2010, WHEN TAKING THE CAR FOR A ROUTINE SERVICE APPOINTMENT, I ASKED THE SERVICE MANAGER TO CHECK FOR THE PROBLEM. HE WANTED TO REPLACE THE CABIN AIR FILTER, WHICH I HAD ALREADY DONE MYSELF. IN SEPTEMBER, 2011, AFTER HURRICANE IRENE, THE TAILGATE HATCH WOULD SLOSH AND SPILL WATER WHEN OPENED. THIS PAST WEEK, I WENT TO DRIVE THE CAR ON AN EXTENDED TRIP. WHEN I WENT TO LIFT THE REAR SEATS, WHICH HAD BEEN FOLDED INTO THE CARGO AREA, TO THE UPRIGHT POSITION, I DISCOVERED THAT THE SEATS WERE COVERED IN MOLD AND RUST AND WERE DRIPPING WITH WATER. THE CARGO AREA CARPETING WAS SATURATED. UPON RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET, I LEARNED THAT THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE AT LEAST NOVEMBER, 2010. BESIDES THE HEATH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EXPOSURE TO INHALING MOLD, THE RUST MAY HAVE COMPROMISED THE INTEGRITY OF THE HARDWARE SECURING THE SEATS TO THE FLOOR, TO SAY NOTHING OF THE COSMETIC DAMAGE TO THE LEATHER OF THE SEATS.  *TR",

MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE REAR MOTOR MOUNT ON THESE CARS WAS DESIGNED TO HELP DAMPEN ANY VIBRATION CAUSED WHEN THE 2 CYLINDERS WERE NOT IN USE AND HAS BEEN WEARING OUT BEFORE ITS REGULAR LIFE (SOME AT 50,000 MILES).  I REQUEST THAT NHTSA LOOK INTO BOTH THE DESIGN OF THIS DEVICE AND ALSO THE EXCESSIVE COST OF THE PART FOR THESE CARS (OTHER ENGINE MOUNTS ARE CONSIDERABLY CHEAPER) -- AND I PROPOSE A RECALL TO REPLACE THE PART.

MY VAN HAS LESS THAN 60,000 MILES AND IS JUST OVER THE 5 YEAR MARK, SO IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY. AS LONG AS HONDA IS ALLOWED TO DEFER THE COST OF THIS REPAIR TO ITS OWNERS IT WILL.

I ALMOST COULD NOT TURN AT THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL AND COULD HAVE GOT HIT BY THE CAR BEHIND ME A FEW DAYS BACK AND ALSO COULD NOT TURN INTO A STREET IN TRAFFIC AND ALMOST GOT HIT BY ANOTHER CAR BEHIND ME SINCE I COULD NOT MOVE. HONDA USA TELLS ITS CONSUMERS THAT THEY DO NOT COVER MANUFACTURING DEFECTS LEADING TO SAFETY ISSUES IF VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY. SOON ENOUGH THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO A LOT OF STEERING ISSUES AND YOU CAN CHECK THE WEB WITH THE SEARCH TERM \"HONDA ODYSSEY 2006 STEERING ISSUES\" AND YOU WILL FIND MANY INCIDENTS AS RELATED TO THE POWER STEERING PUMP. STEERING IS THE CRUCIAL PART OF ANY VEHICLE AND SUCH CALLOUSNESS ON PART OF HONDA DEFINITELY CALLS FOR A INVESTIGATION BEFORE WE SEE A LOT OF ACCIDENTS DUE A STEERING WHEEL GETTING STUCK. THE DEALERS DIAGNOSIS AFTER CHECK UP WAS TO REPLACE THE STEERING PUMP SO THAT THE PUMP WILL PUSH ENOUGH FLUID AT LOW SPEEDS AND NOT CAUSE THE STEERING WHEEL TO GET STUCK.

SHE MANAGED TO MAKE IT HOME, BUT BETWEEN THE POWER LOSS AND THE NOISE STARTING TO COME FROM UNDER THE HOOD, SHE WAS NERVOUS.    WE HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A GENTILE HONDA IN RACINE WI.  THEY REPORTED THAT THE SPARK PLUG WAS PULLED OUT OF THE CYLINDER HEAD WHEN THE COIL-PACK \"POPPED\".  I BELIEVE THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WAS A MATERIAL FAILURE IN THE CYLINDER HEAD WHICH CAUSED THE SPARK PLUG THREADS TO FAIL, WHICH RESULTED IN THE COIL-PACK SHORTING TO GROUND ON THE HEAD, AND CAUSING AN OVER-CURRENT CONDITION THROUGH THE COIL WHICH CAUSED THE COIL-PACK TO EXPLODE.    GENTILE HONDA WANTS TO DO A MACHINIST REPAIR ON THE CYLINDER HEAD WHILE IT'S STILL ON THE ENGINE ($730.42).  NORTH AMERICAN HONDA WANTS TO REPLACE THE CYLINDER WITH SOME MONETARY ASSISTANCE FOR A TOTAL OF $1500.    NO ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN AT THIS TIME TO CORRECT THE ISSUE.    I FEEL THIS IS A MATERIAL DEFECT CAUSED BY HONDA'S PART VENDOR.  GENTILE HONDA CLAIMS THE COIL-PACK PULLED THE PLUG OUT OF THE ALUMINUM HEAD.  I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN AS THE TENSILE/SHEAR STRENGTH OF THE PLASTIC COIL-PACK  IS FAR LESS THAN THE TENSILE/SHEAR STRENGTH OF THE ALUMINUM ALLOY HEAD.

WHEN I TOOK MY VAN TO HAVE THE TIRES CHANGED, I TOOK IT TO 3 DIFFERENT SHOPS AND TOLD ME THAT ONLY A HONDA DEALER OR A CERTIFIED SHOP COULD DO IT AND THE COST IS $1,500.00 TO CHANGE THEM.  I TRIED TO CONTACT THE ROCK HONDA  AND THEY ACTUALLY HUNG UP ON ME 3 TIMES, ONE OF THE SALES PERSON TOLD ME THAT TIRES WERE EASY TO CHANGE THAT \"HE COULD PURCHASE AND CHANGE TIRES IN HIS OWN GARAGE\" THAT THE PEOPLE FROM THE SHOP DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT. WELL I CALLED HONDA MOTOR CO,INC AND MICHELIN AND  THE ONLY THING THEY DID WAS APOLOGIZED FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.  IF I HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS GOING TO HAVE SUCH AN EXPENSIVE MAINTENANCE I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT, BUT OH WELL I'M STUCK WITH IT NOW, AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF, THE ROOF IS LEAKING AND THE WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER LEAKS, AND THE DOOR ON THE RIGHT SIDE MAKES A LOUD NOISE WHEN IT OPENS AND CLOSES BUT IT'S THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE WARRANTY.  *TR",

I  DID SOME RESEARCH AND TALKED WITH HONDA AGAIN AND THEY SAID THAT THEY SEE THIS ALOT. THEY SHOWED ME MY RADIATOR AND THREE ROCKS THAT THEY PULLED OUT OF IT SAYING THAT THESE ARE WHAT CAUSED MY PROBLEM. THEY ASKED IF THEY COULD FIX THE RADIATOR WHILE THEY HAD THE PARTS IN STOCK AND I SAID YES KNOWING THAT I NEED MY CAR ASAP. I LATER CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN TO QUESTION THE INCIDENT WITH THE ROCKS BECAUSE I TALKED WITH ANOTHER MECHANIC AND HE SAID THAT THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPENED THAT EASILY. THEY STILL HAVE THE OLD RADIATOR. THE LEVEL OF COURTESY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT I HAVE RECEIVED FROM HONDA HAS DRAMATICALLY DROPPED SINCE I HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING THIS ISSUE.

WHILE WE WERE MADE AWARE THE ADDITIONAL COST IN TIRE REPLACEMENT, WE WERE NOT MADE AWARE OF THE HIGHER FREQUENCY THIS WOULD OCCUR.  IN FACT WE WERE ASSURED BY A CERTIFIED HONDA TECHNICIAN THAT THE TREAD WEAR OF THE MICHELIN PAX TIRES WAS SUPERIOR TO THAT OF SIMILAR MINI-VAN TIRES.

WELL THEN COMES COLD WEATHER AND I STARTING HEARING IT AGAIN SO THIS TIME I CONTACTED AMERICAN HONDA AND THE DIRECTOR FOR SERVICE AND HE MET ME HALF WAY AND HE HEARD THE WHINING NOISE AND STATED THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM FOR HONDA AND THEY ARE NOT SURE HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  HE STATED THEY HAD PUT 6 NEW POWER STEERING PUMPS ON ANOTHER ODYSSEY AND COULD NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  WELL THEY REPLACED MY POWER STEERING PUMP AND ABOUT A MONTH LATER IT STARTED MAKING THE NOISE YET AGAIN.  I CONTACTED THE SERVICE DIRECTOR AGAIN AND HE SAID HE WOULD NOTE IT AND I COULD GET IT FIXED WHEN I WANTED TO SO I HAVE NOW TAKEN MY VAN BACK TO THE SHOP TO GET IT FIXED AGAIN.  I WILL BE WRITING A CERTIFIED LETTER TO HONDA AND WILL FILE THE LEMON LAW IF NEED BE.  I HAVE 3 KIDS AND I REALLY NEED MY VAN AND THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE FOR ME AND MY FAMILY.
