Now it randomly changes the radio stations or inputs, turns the climate system on and off, repeatedly asks to adjust the clock, prevents the use of the back up camera, and beeps loudly each time.  Once the system begins malfunctioning it keeps doing it over and over again rapidly and the driver is not always able to turn the system off.

Contact was made with Jeep who informed us to contact UConnect.  UConnect recommended we reload the software update which did NOT correct the problem.   Our mechanic recommended disconnecting the battery overnight to reset the system.  This worked for 24 hours and the problem began again.  After researching this issue it appears to be in multiple other Chyrsler vehicles.

The integrated fuel pump relay in the TIPM fails. This has left my wife stranded in potentially dangerous areas. It has also died while the vehicle was in motion.  In addition to the TIPM issues, the digitizer of the factory radio/navigation system has delaminated from the LCD screen. The safety issues this causes are multiple: random phone calls while driving (distracting), random radio station changes (again, distracting to a driver), and an inability to properly utilize navigation (potentially dangerous if it tries to change a route and indicates last-second turns). It also prevents the driver from calling someone if they are in need of help. Not only does hands-free calling not work, but even when taking out the phone to dial, the haywire behavior of the device being connected via bluetooth makes calls difficult. These are known issues by the Jeep dealer with frequent warranty replacements admitted by the advisor and technician, yet they have been zero assistance in helping because the vehicle is out of warranty. It will require action from someone like the NHTSA to get Jeep to correct these problems for many owners. It is criminal to charge people this amount of money for a vehicle that simply doesn't do what it is supposed to do.",

This collection of problems is certainly a safety issue.  However, at this time Jeep has not set a recall.  It looks as though Jeep has decided to just stick it to their loyal customers and let them pay up to  $ 2,000 for replacing the console.

This has to be unacceptable because now you have a distracted driver have to deal with the screen but the fact EVERYONE knows this is a defect of the device. From the dealership where I bought the vehicle to the Uconnect support person who personally told me that this was ridiculous that the manufacturer has not been made to correct this even when they (Chrysler) knows this. I understand that you do not deal with shady business practices but now this has become such an issue that I believe it leads to distracted driving. That is a safety issue and that needs to be looked into by NHTSA.

The vehicle was taken to a third dealer Huffines Chrysler Jeep Dodge RAM Plano (4500 W Plano Pkwy, Plano, TX 75093) who could not determine the cause of the failure. The contact referenced NHTSA Campaign Number: 18V524000 (Electrical System). The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The vehicle was not repaired.

Both episodes occurred abruptly, engine idling extremely rough, then shutting down within seconds, leaving the car completely inoperable. Both episodes were very dangerous as the car could barely coast to the shoulder of the highway for safety of the passengers.   The first episode occurred when the car was a few months old, gas gauge showing over 1/4 tank of diesel gas.  Car was towed to the Jeep dealership where they claimed that the car simply ran out of diesel (despite the gas gauge indication) no repair \"was required\", car filled with several gallons of diesel and OBD codes reset by the dealer, car then ran normally .   The second episode occurred one week ago. Again driving at highway speed, 5 lane highway, over 1/4 of diesel remaining on the gauge, sudden violent engine running, sudden  full loss of function of the vehicle, nearly in an accident simply trying to \" limp \" to an emergency stop on the road shoulder. Car required towing to our residence. with the prior experience at the Jeep dealer, despite gauge reading of greater 1/4 tank, the car was filled with 5 gallons of diesel,  car started normally. All OBD fault codes insufficient fuel to the engine, fuel rail, fuel pressure, etc.   The car has run normally since. I contacted my Jeep dealership and they stated they have no knowledge of any similar issues with this Jeep Diesel engine.  The internet and Jeep car forums are filled with identical Diesel engine problems. Either related to faulty fuel pressure regulation or some design fault with fuel level indication affecting the safe operation of this Jeep Diesel engine. these problems date back to pre 2008.   We now feel very unsafe to drive this relatively new 2018 Jeep Diesel Grand Cherokee at highway speeds without hovering near the shoulder lane of the road.",

The digitizer on the display is coming unglued (due to heat), it is causing the touchscreen to do things on its own like change the time, call people, switch radio stations.  Safety at Risk: While it may not seem like a safety issue outright, when those phantom touches happen is very distracting to the driver. In addition, after reading about other cases where the delamination is even worse, the glue that is essentially melting has been seen to start dripping on other components and wiring inside the center stack, like air conditioning and parking sensor control and traction control button.   Reproduced: This is a very well-known issue within the Jeep/FCA family of vehicles. I called their customer service and they were 100% aware, they were ready with a replacement option right away but at my cost. This is a manufacture defect and should be covered by FCA. I live in Cleveland, OH, the hottest it has gotten here is 90 degrees, this screen should have been tested well beyond that temp. If the glue is melting in this weather, it needs to be replaced as a recall.  Inspected: No, but I will give it to anyone to inspect. Mine is not as bad as others I have seen but I would like to get is replaced before it becomes an even bigger safety issue.   Warnings: No, the car itself does not realize anything is wrong, it thinks that a human being is touching the screen, so it is doing the commands it is given.",

While some of these may not be considered safety-related (environmental controls), I would respectfully suggest that others are, including: random and unexpected changing, turning on or off radio various audio at various sound levels (imagine turning on your car and somebody jokingly set the radio to an extremely loud volume - funny, but not necessarily unsafe. Now imagine that happens randomly while you are driving down the road!);  interfaced mobile phone randomly placing calls (I have had this happen; solved by disconnecting phone, but was extremely distracting the first time it happened);  random activation of the rear-view camera while driving;  navigation system randomly activates (and tries to direct you somewhere you are not going); AND inability to disable the screen in order to alleviate the distractions (ghost touches automatically turn it back on).    This is apparently an issue with tons of Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram vehicles...especially 2018 and later.  To this point, FCA is refusing to address if out of warranty (which many, including mine, now are).  Let me be clear, I am not trying to avoid an out-of-warranty repair on my dime, but I truly believe that the random activation of many of these systems - and the inability to disable most of those - is so distracting that it presents a major safety issue.

I keep receiving \"Service Shifter\" message. Check engine light stays on for a while (2-3 days) then eventually goes off. Took it in for service, which they kept for a little bit and allegedly fixed. A few months later, same message popped up again, but this time the engine wouldn't down shift, tachometer kept going higher and higher - had to pull of highway and restart vehicle for it to run correctly. Took it to dealership again, they kept the vehicle for a week, dealership had to get approval to fix under warranty (had to work on transmission). On July 5th, I was driving on highway, service shifter error popped up again, but was still driveable, or so I thought...About a minute later, a message popped up telling me to drive directly to dealership for service, if I turned the vehicle off, it wouldn't start again. I drove a little further to the next exit, turned blinker on and all the lights on the dash were flashing, blinker worked, but much slower. I drove to gas station and it started back up, but check engine light remained on for a couple of days. My brother traded his Jeep in for electrical issues, looks like I'll be doing the same, unfortunately. 38K miles and keeps acting up.",

Numerous vehicles at highway speeds had to make rapid maneuvers to avoid hitting us. After coming to a stop and putting the vehicle in park, I restarted the vehicle. The engine light was now on and there were numerous messages coming up on the display. There were also random electrical occurrences as well, rear wiper running with switch in off position. This was a very dangerous situation. Had the individual behind us not had room to maneuver into the adjacent lane he would have impacted us for sure. This seems to be a known issue that needs to be addressed. As this incident just happened i have not a chance to contact a dealer yet. There was no warning prior to the incident. We have had no issues with this vehicle to this point save one, and I do not know if they are related or not. But randomly for a few months prior to this incident, the vehicles radio/control console would freeze up becoming totally unresponsive. It will eventually reboot itself and begin working again. Sometimes after one restart and other times it takes several restarts after varying lengths of time being frozen. The frequency of these occurrences seem to be increasing also. If this was just your radio controls it would be annoying enough, this is your control center for everything. Have not addressed this with the dealer yet as well.

PUTTING                        PERSONAL SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF EVERYONE ELSE IN A HIGHLY                        DANGEROUS SITUATION. AND THEN THE COPS COME TELL YOU THEY WILL TOW                        YOU AT YOUR OWN EXPENSE.             - I HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO JUMP THE VEHICLE ALL OF THE TIMES I HAVE BEEN             STRANDED. LET ME BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU THAT TWO CARS STOPPED DEAD IN THE             MIDDLE OF A HIGHWAY PERFORMING A JUMP IS 100% A LIFE THREATENING SITUATION.     NOW, THE VEHICLE ALSO LIKES TO DECIDE THAT IT JUST DOESN'T WANT TO START AT ERRATIC INTERVALS. I HAVE NOW 3 TIMES EXPERIENCED MY VEHICLE JUST FLAT OUT NOT STARTING.ONCE RIGHT IN THE MORNING AT WORK, ONCE AT WORK TRYING TO GO FOR LUNCH AND THE FINAL TIME BEING AT LUNCH.     IT'S BECOME PAINFULLY CLEAR THAT THE DEALERSHIP HAS NO IDEA WHAT IS WRONG AND THEY ARE NOW SENDING ME OUT ON LABRAT EXCURSIONS HOPING THEY FIXED AN ISSUE THEY CANNOT IDENTIFY. THEY ARE DOING THIS KNOWING FULL WELL THAT THE COST OF FAILURE COULD END UP BEING MY LIFE.",

I WAS ABLE TO GET TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BEFORE THE GLASS SHOWERED INTO MY VEHICLE AND OVER MY HEAD.

I HAD THE CAR TOWED ON A FLATBED TRUCK TO THE DEALER THAT I PURCHASED IT FROM AND SINCE, IT'S BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE SHOP 3 TIMES.  THE DEALER REPLACED THE FRONT SUNROOF GLASS, SEALS AND VACUUMED OUT MY CAR, HOWEVER THE DAY AFTER PICKING IT UP, MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF GLASS REMAINED IN THE CEILING AREA. THE SECOND ATTEMPT AND CLEANING UP THE GLASS, THEY HAD TO REMOVED THE INTERIOR HEADER AND SEATS TO TRY AND EXTRACT ALL THE BROKEN GLASS FRAGMENTS.  I'M TAKING THE CAR BACK IN FOR THE 4TH TIME, BECAUSE THERE IS STILL BROKEN GLASS SHIFTING AROUND BETWEEN THE SUNROOF AND SUNSCREEN. THE REPAIRS HAVE THUS FAR BEEN COVERED BY WARRANTY (MANUFACTURED DEFECT), BUT THIS BRAND NEW VEHICLE IS RUINED.

I STEERED IT INTO THE NEXT EMPTY SHOOTING BAY IN 1/2 CIRCLE INTO THE BACKSTOP ENDING UP AT THE WALL WHICH WAS DAMAGED IN THE PROCESS. ALL FRONT AND SIDE AIRBAGS WERE DEPLOYED.
