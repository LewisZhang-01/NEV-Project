IT TOOK SEVERAL VISITS TO GET INFO FROM THEM ON THIS BECAUSE THEY \"DIDNT WANT TO REVEAL TOO MUCH INFO\" TO ME,THE CONSUMER.APPARENTLY IF SUBARUS COOLANT ADDITIVE WAS ADDED BEFORE 100,000 MI. AND DOCUMENTED @ A CERTIFIED SERVICE CENTER,SUBARU WOULD COVER THE BILL FOR A NEW CYLINDER HEAD GASKET, IF NOT THEN IT WOULD NOT BE COVERED. MY QUESTION IS IF THE ADDITIVE WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR THE HEAD GASKET TO SURVIVE BEING RUN THEN WHY WASNT IT ADDED AT THE FACTORY OR DEALER BEFORE SALE,AND WHOSE JOB WAS IT TO TELL THE CONSUMERS THAT IT NEEDED TO BE ADDED.THE BILL IS AROUND 1200$ AND FROM MY RESEARCH AND OBSERVATIONS OF VEHICLES W THE SAME MOTOR (I WORK IN THE AUTO BODY REPAIR BUSINESS) THIS HAPPENS TO MOST FAIRLY EARLY IN THE ENGINES LIFE.I THINK THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY SUBARU THE MANUFACTURER,AND RESULT IN A TOTAL RECALL AND REPAIR OF THIS PROBLEM.THEY HAVE ALREADY LOST ME AS A CUSTOMER, AND ACTUALLY THE LAST TIME I TRIED CONTACT W THEM THEYRE RESPONSE WAS \"WE WILL REMOVE YOU FROM OUR CONTACT LIST\". *TR",
