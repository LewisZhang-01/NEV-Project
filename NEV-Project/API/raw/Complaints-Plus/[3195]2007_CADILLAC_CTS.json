THE SERVICE AIRBAG LIGHT WOULD COME ON THE DASH & INFORMATION CENTER THEN NOW IT IS STAYING ON AT 90,000 MILES. I CONTACTED GMC ABOUT THE BRAKE ISSUES & THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS NO RECALLS FOR ANY BRAKE ISSUES!! I ALSO ASKED ABOUT THE RECALL FOR THE AIRBAG FOR MY 2007 VEHICLE BUT THEY INFORMED ME IT WASN'T FOR MY VIN # BUT IT IS HAVING THE SAME EXACT ISSUES AS THE RECALL!! SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET SERIOUSLY INJURED DUE TO THESE HAZARDS!! GMC/CADILLAC NEEDS TO STEP UP & CORRECT THESE ISSUES BEFORE IT IS TO LATE!!

I OWN A 2007 CADILLAC CTS-V WHICH I PAID $41,000.00 WHEN IT WAS NEW, WITH LOANS THE CAR ENDED UP COSTING ME $55,000.00 WHICH I WAS WILLING TO PAY. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL CAR. NOW HERE IS WHAT HAS HAPPENED. I NOW HAVE ABOUT 19,190 MILES ON IT AND AT 15,000 MILES I REPLACED THE TIRES. BEING A V THEY PUT ON BRIDGESTONE POTENZA'S. THAT COST ME ABOUT $1000.00. AT 17,000 MILES I HAD A SENSOR GO OUT ON MY RIGHT FRONT TIRE, THAT CONTROLS MY BRAKES. THAT COST ME $600.00. AT THE SAME TIME THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED FRONT BRAKES. THAT ONLY COST ME $300.00 BECAUSE I HAD A COUPON AND TOLD THEM TO JUST REPLACE THE PADS AND DO NOT TURN THE ROTOR. AT 19,160 MILES THE LEFT WHEEL SENSOR WENT ALONG WITH ONE IN THE STEERING WHEEL. THIS IS GOING TO COST ME ANOTHER $1200.00. THE REASON I AM WRITING THIS IS BECAUSE A FRIEND TOLD ME ABOUT A WEBSITE CALLED \"EDMUNDS CAR REVIEW\" AND I WENT ON THIS SITE TO FIND OUT THAT CADILLAC HAS HAD THIS ISSUE SINCE 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 ETC. MOST OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN SOME SATISFACTION FROM CADILLAC AND SOLD THEIR CAR BEFORE THE NEXT REPAIRS. SO I BEG OF YOU, IF YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW IS CONSIDERING BUYING A CADILLAC CTS, CTS-V THAT THEY READ THE EDMUND REPORT FIRST. I AM NOW CONTACTING THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY SAFETY ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE BBB HAS GUIDE LINES THAT RESTRICT THEM FROM DOING ANYTHING ABOUT ISSUES 6 MONTHS OUT OF WARRANTY. SO PLEASE TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS TO DO THE RESEARCH AND LOOK INTO OTHER LUXURY CARS BEFORE BUYING A CADILLAC. ONE MORE THING, I WENT TO DINNER AND WENT TO PULL INTO A PARKING SPOT AND THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR AND STARTED CHATTERING AND THE CAR ROLLED INTO THE SPOT.",

WHILE DRIVING WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL ON, TRAVELING AROUND 77 MPH, AT ABOUT MILE MARKER 88, I HEARD A LARGE THUD NOISE LIKE SOMETHING HIT THE UNDERBODY OF THE VEHICLE. I THEN HEARD A LOUD METALLIC RINGING NOISE AND FELT A VIBRATION THROUGH THE VEHICLE FLOOR AND STEERING WHEEL. I PUT MY TURN SIGNAL ON TO GET OVER TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD. AS I TURNED MY HEAD TO THE RIGHT TO SEE IF IT WAS CLEAR TO GET OVER, I NOTICED A LARGE CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE EMITTING FROM THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE AND COULD SEE AN ORANGE REFLECTION OF FLAMES IN THE DRIVER'S DOOR OF THE VEHICLE TO THE RIGHT OF ME.     I GOT OVER TO THE SHOULDER AT MILE MARKER 87.     I INSPECTED THE VEHICLE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON, I LOOKED AT THE LEFT SIDE AND DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING, THEN WALKED OVER TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE VEHICLE (I WAS STANDING ABOUT 10 FT BEHIND THE VEHICLE ON THE RIGHT SIDE) AND NOTICED FLAMES SHOOTING OUT FROM UNDER THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  I WALKED BACK ABOUT 50 FEET AND CALLED 911 AND REPORTED THE VEHICLE FIRE. THE INDEPENDENCE TOWNSHIP SHERIFF'S OFFICE RESPONDED ABOUT 5 MINUTES LATER AND WAS GOING TO ATTEMPT TO PUT THE FIRE OUT, BUT BY THAT TIME THE FLAMES WERE SHOOTING OUT OF HOOD OF THE VEHICLE. THE FLAMES WERE ABOUT 4 TO 5 FT AT THAT TIME AND THE OFFICER DECIDED NOT TO ATTEMPT TO PUT THE FIRE OUT. FIRE DEPARTMENT SHOWED UP ABOUT 10 MINUTES AFTER THE SHERIFF WAS THERE AND PUT THE FIRE OUT. I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO RANDY WEISS GM DEALER IN FENTON, MICHIGAN.    VEHICLE MILEAGE  74,665 MILES.
