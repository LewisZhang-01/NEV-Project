WE ALSO PURCHASED A 1999 CHEVY MONTE CARLO SIGHT UNSEEN AT THE SAME TIME WE PURCHASED OUR EXPRESS VAN. WE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE FRONT END ALIGNMENT OF THE MONTE CARLO AND IT WAS THE TREAD OFF OF THE LEFT FRONT TIRE AFTER TWO THOUSAND MILES. THEY KEPT TELLING US THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE ALIGNMENT AFTER TAKING THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP NUMEROUS TIMES.  JIM COX TRIED TO TELL US THAT MY WIFE MADE TOO MANY LEFT HAND TURNS AND INSULTED MY WIFE ABOUT HER WEIGHT  NEITHER VEHICLES WERE EVER TITLED BEFORE WE PURCHASED THEM.  PROBLEMS ON BOTH VEHICLES STARTED TO OCCUR IMMEDIATLY AND WE HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT TROUBLE WITH TRYING TO GET THE WARRANTY WORK DONE ON THEM.  NOW THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED AND THE PROBLEMS I HAVE HAD WITH MY VAN STILL EXISTS AND IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY WORSE.  JIM COX WAS THE AREA SERVICE REPRESENATIVE FOR ALL OF CENTRAL FLORIDA CHEVY DEALERSHIPS AND TOLD THE SERVICE  MANAGER \"IF IT'S NOT BROKE DON'T FIX IT\" AND HE HAD NO PROBLEM STATING THAT RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY WIFE AND MYSELF.  CALLED HEAD OFFICE  THAY DID NOT WHONT TO NKOW,  NEVER EVER BUY CHEVE EVER  EVER AGAIN.  *AK",
