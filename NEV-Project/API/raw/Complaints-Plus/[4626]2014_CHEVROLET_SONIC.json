Water pump was replaced and cylinder heads and gaskets. This was done through the warranty company. Car was returned to me on 14 December 2021 and was in a repair shop the following day because of the check engine light was on.  Car now needs new motor as coolant was going inside the motor.   Sensors had never gone off before that day. Currently car is in the chevy dealer for over a month trying to figure out who will pay for the repairs  as I also had an extended  warranty.

(my job has us all working from home since March of 2020, so I only do local shopping, no long distance). Due to the codes mentioned above, my car was \u201crepaired\u201d at dealership on January 4, 2012. In the end of March I was constantly getting the same codes over a period of two days. I called GM (1 800 462 8782) on March 29, spoke with a woman by the name of Michelle and I explained what has been happening with the vehicle codes, along with other issues over the past year. She opened a case file # 9-6627321866 and she called the dealership to discuss my issue. I was told to drop the car off and it will be repair at no cost to me. The car was brought to dealership on April 7, 2021 and when the diagnostic was preformed, it showed no codes in the history. They did no repair at that time and gave me back the car. While running local errand on April 17, all the same codes appeared and once again I had reduced engine power. I was near the dealership and dropped off the vehicle, even though the service department was closed at that time. Once again, a new pedal and sensor was installed. I told them to please keep the vehicle for a few days, test drive it once in a while to ensure it is truly repaired. They test drove it several times during the  4 days they had it and since there were no issues, I picked the vehicle up on April 22, 2021.On June 5, while driving to a store a nearby store, I was stopped at a light to make a left turn and all the codes suddenly came on. I had very little acceleration making the left turn. The vehicle approaching me which was a block and a half away was now very closely approaching me and luckily realized I had an issue and stopped. I immediately headed back home. AutoZone ran a diagnostic and it's the same issue.",

ENGINE AT LOW POWER, WAS ABLE TO DRIFT INTO PARKING LOT. RESTARTED CAR AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES, ALL LIGHTS EXCEPT CHECK ENGINE WENT OFF. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WENT OFF AFTER I PUT GAS IN THE CAR THE NEXT DAY. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN THIS CAR. LONG STORY SHORT THE DEALER WAS GOING TO WORK WITH ME TO TAKE THE CAR BACK, BUT BANK WOULD NOT RELEASE TITLE (LOAN IS VERY UPSIDE DOWN) UNTIL ANOTHER MECHANIC LOOKED AT THE CAR. BANK WANTED ME TO UTILIZE MY WARRANTY PROGRAM I HAD PURCHASED WITH THE CAR LOAN. MECHANIC FOUND P2138 APP SENSOR CODE. WAS LEANING INTO THE DRIVER SIDE ON THE FLOOR TO LOOK UNDER THE DASH AND HIS ELBOW GOT WET. FOUND DRIVER FOOTWELL COMPLETELY SOAKED: CARPET, LINER, AND CARPET PAD. REST OF THE CAR WAS DRY. DISCOVERED THE SUNROOF HAD BEEN LEAKING DOWN INTO THE CAR AND NOT DRAINING OUT PROPERLY ON DRIVER'S SIDE. COULD NOT CHECK ENTIRE DRAIN SYSTEM WITHOUT REMOVING HEADLINER. FOUND WATER HAD COMPROMISED THE SIDE AIR BAG AND WIRE HARNESS; SEVERAL CONNECTORS CORRODED. SPRAYED WATER ON WIRES AND WAS ABLE TO REPLICATE ENGINE POWER LOSS. CONFIRMED THAT WATER WAS LEAKING INTO THE VEHICLE ONTO THE WIRE HARNESS. TEMPORARILY FIXED THE ISSUE WITH DIELECTRIC GREASE TO PREVENT CONNECTORS FROM GETTING WET. MECHANIC LEFT THE PANELS OFF SO I CAN MONITOR THE SUNROOF LEAKING. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN THE CAR BECAUSE OF THE AIR BAG BEING WET AND MAY NOT DEPLOY PROPERLY, THE WET CARPET PAD WHICH COULD CAUSE RUST AND MOLD, AND THE CORRODED WIRE TERMINALS. WILL CONTACT DEALER AND BANK TOMORROW. I AM HOPING THEY WILL TAKE THE CAR OFF MY HANDS AS IT WILL BE A FEW YEARS TIL I CAN PAY IT OFF AND I DON'T WANT AN ACCIDENT BEFORE THEN.",

I FEEL THAT YOU KNEW WHEN YOU ROLLED THE PIECE OF JUNK OFF THE ASSEMBLY LINE THAT IT WAS NOT GOING TO BE WOTH ANYTHING AFTER THAT FIRST YEAR! THOUGH MY VIN DOES NOT RENDER ANY RESULTS IN THE RECAL SEARCH PORTAL, IT SHOULD! I HAVE HAD SO MUCH MAJOR WORK DONE ON THIS CAR AND IT HAS NOT EVEN BEEN 10 YEARS YET!  I NEED GUIDANCE IN FILING A CLASS ACTION AGAINST CHEVROLET BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE ARE MAJOR ISSUES WITH THE CRAFTSMANSHIP OF THE VEHICLE, YET YOU WON'T ISSUE A RECALL.

I TOLD THEM ABOUT IT AN THEY SAID IF IT KEEPS DOING IT TO LET THEM KNOW AN MY PASSENGER SIDE BRAKES FELL LIKE THEY ARE DRAGGING. THEY SAID IT SHOULD COME OUT OF IT DO TO SITTING FOR AWHILE. WELL I'M STILL EXPERIENCING IT. MY OIL PERCENTAGE DROPS FAR DOWN WHEN DRIVING FOR 2 HRS ON THE HIGHWAY. THE BURNING SMELL COMES IN THREW THE VENTS AN OUTSIDE EVEN WHEN THE AC OR HEATER IS ON. SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT. I ONLY HAVE 39,000 MILES WHEN I BOUGHT IT A MOTH AGO WITH 32,000 MILES. THE DEALER SAID IT WENT THROUGH AN EXPECTATION AN EVERYTHING CAME BACK OK WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR THAT DAY. HOW CAN THAT BE WITH BURNING SMELL,LIGHTS OUT AN ONLY ONE SIDE OF WHEEL THAT I'M GETTING A DRAGGING, GRINDING NOISES. THEY WELL BE LOOKING AT IT IN THE NEXT 2WEEK. WHEN I'M DRIVING MY TRANSMISSION FEELS LIKE ITS SKIPPING. THE ACCELERATION IS SO OFF.",
