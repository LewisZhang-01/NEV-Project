WHILE DRIVING FROM YOSEMITE VALLEY TO FRESNO CA., ON A COLD MORNING, WITH SNOW ON THE GROUND, I STARTED TO SMELL WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE OVERHEATING BRAKES. SINCE WE WERE GOING MOSTLY DOWNHILL, I WAS ALREADY DRIVING CAUTIOUSLY IN SECOND GEAR. I THEN SHIFTED DOWN INTO FIRST GEAR AND WAS GOING SO SLOW THAT THE BRAKES WERE HARDLY NEEDED AT ALL.  THAT SEEMED TO MAKE NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL, AND THE BRAKES SOON LOST ALL STOPPING POWER AND THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR, AND COULD NOT BE PUMPED UP AT ALL. I WAS ABLE TO FIND A LEVEL TURN OUT AND STOP THE VEHICLE WITH THE PARKING BRAKE.. THE VEHICLE WAS THEN TOWED INTO FRESNO CA. FOR REPAIRS.   REPAIRS: BUD EBERWEIN AUTOMOTIVE (ALSO AN AUTHORIZED WORKHORSE REPAIR SHOP, SAID ALL 4 CALIPERS, BRAKE PAD SETS AND SEALS WERE BURNED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.
