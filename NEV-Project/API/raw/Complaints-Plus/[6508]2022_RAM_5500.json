        "summary": "Owners manual and marketing documents for 2022 RAM 5500 contain incomplete and obsolete information about diesel fueling requirements causing increased safety risk for drivers.    These documents imply that without B20 option / package, vehicle cannot be safely fueled with diesel that contains ANY percentage of bio mass.  Fuel must be straight petro diesel (B0) which is impossible to obtain in most of the United States as many states mandate at least 5% bio mass (B5).  In addition, for the past few years, B20 optioned vehicles have not been available from RAM leaving customers with no choice but to buy non B20 vehicles and use them with fuel that contains at least some bio mass.  Call to RAM indicated that since 2019, vehicles with Cummins 6.7 diesel engine may be safety fueled and operated with up to 20% bio mass (B20).  This information has been conveniently omitted from owners manuals and marketing material.  Safety risk; Currently many customers are on the road and driving longer than necessary to obtain B0 fuel. This causes increased risk of accidents for every one. In addition, drivers are polluting the environment driving more than necessary searching for B0 diesel.  The increased pollution causes safety risk for all humans and animals as toxic fumes are emitted from RAM trucks with needless driving.     I am requesting NHTSA intervene on behalf of US customers to require FCA LLC / Stellantis N.A to do the following:    1) Identify by VIN which vehicles may be safety operated on B20 and send owners a written notice so there is clarity on B20 diesel fueling options.    2) NHTSA require FCA LLC / Stellantis N.A update the owners manual on B20 fueling options and make an electronic copy available to all owners for future reference.    3) Notify all dealers of the B20 fueling option so they can inform customers correctly of this green fueling alternative.",
