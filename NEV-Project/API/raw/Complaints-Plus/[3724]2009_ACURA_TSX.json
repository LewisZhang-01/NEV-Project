I COULD NOT TURN IT OFF BY PRESSING THE ON/OFF BUTTON ON THE RADIO AND I COULD NOT DECREASE THE VOLUME. I HAD TO PULL OVER IMMEDIATELY AND TURN THE MOTOR OFF. ONCE OFF, I RESTARTED THE CAR AND TRIED TO INITIATE A HANDS-FREE CALL AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. AND AGAIN, I HAD TO TURN THE CAR OFF TO STOP THE NOISE. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT SORT OF DAMAGE THIS MIGHT HAVE DONE TO THE SPEAKERS OR RADIO/AMPLIFIER.

PER THE DEALERS INSTRUCTIONS, I HAVE USED ONLY PREMIUM FUEL IN THE VEHICLE SINCE THE PURCHASE DATE.  I HEARD THIS KNOCKING NOISE WHILE DRIVING THE CAR THROUGHOUT THE WINTER; HOWEVER, THE NOISE HAS BECOME PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER AS THE WEATHER HAS BECOME WARMER (THE NOISE IS MUCH LOUDER WHEN THE TEMPERATURE IS ABOVE 60 DEGREES).  I TOOK THE CAR INTO THE DEALER (WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR) TODAY (4/24/09).  ONE OF THE TECHNICIANS RODE ALONG WITH ME, AND I WAS ABLE TO REPLICATE THE NOISE FOR HIM.  THE TECHNICIAN ACKNOWLEDGED THE NOISE AND SAID THAT I SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT, THAT IT IS A NORMAL CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CAR.  I RECEIVED A RECEIPT FROM THE DEALER STATING THIS IN WRITING.  ALTHOUGH THE DEALER STATES THAT THIS IS A NORMAL NOISE, IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'VE EVER HEARD IN ANY OTHER CAR BEFORE (INCLUDING MY LAST CAR, WHICH WAS ALSO AN ACURA) AND I'M CONCERNED THAT THIS PROBLEM MAY ACTUALLY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.  THERE ARE MANY OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE REPORTED THE SAME PROBLEM ON THIS WEBSITE, AND ON MANY OF THE ACURA DISCUSSION BOARDS.
