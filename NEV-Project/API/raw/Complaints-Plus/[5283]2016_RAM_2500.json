The contact stated while the vehicle was parked and running, she opened the front driver's side door and stepped on the running board with her body between the front driver's side door and the vehicle frame. The vehicle lunged forward independently, turned to the left and crashed into the front end of the passenger's side of the unoccupied vehicle parked next to it. The contact became trapped between the two vehicles and pinned between the driver's side door and the frame of her vehicle. The contact stated that the vehicle was squeezing continuously as if it had shifted into drive. The contact attempted to honk the horn by extending the keys on her left arm but was unsuccessful and started screaming for help. Two individuals arrived at the scene but could not unlock the door and were unable to break the front passenger's side window to unlock the door in order to extract the contact. The contact squeezed her body and reached out the unlock button on the driver's side door, and she unlocked the door.  One of the individual got inside the vehicle, shifted into reverse and reversed slowly in order to release and extract the contact. The vehicle was parked. The contact was then extracted but was knocked unconscious. The contact was airlifted to the hospital where she was informed that she had sustained six broken ribs, damaged clavicle required surgery, damaged lungs due to squeezing, squeezed organs to one side of her abdomen, bruises on both glutes and bruised hips. A police report was filed. The vehicle was towed to the local collision center. The collision center informed the contact that the driver's side frame of the vehicle she was squeezed against was dented, which showed the severity of the squeezing. The local Chrysler dealer and the manufacturer were not notified of the failure. The vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 72,000.",

I HAVE HAD FRIENDS AND FAMILY COMMENT ON HOW BAD THE DELAY/LAG IS! I AM VERY DISHEARTENED BY THIS TO THE POINT THAT I AM NOW PRICING OUT A 2017 F-350. WE ARE PURCHASING A NEW TOY HAULER AND IN NO WAY WOULD I HOOK IT TO MY 2016 RAM DIESEL DUE TO THE THROTTLE DELAY/LAG. THIS IS MY 4TH DODGE TRUCK AND TO SWITCH BRANDS HAS BEEN A MAJOR ISSUE FOR ME.

AFTER 1200 MILES, THE DIESEL EMISSION FLUID (DEF) GAUGE BECAME ERRATIC AND GAVE ME A MESSAGE THAT AFTER 200 MILES THE TRUCK'S MAXIMUM SPEED WOULD BE 5 MILES/HOUR.  THE AM DEALER IN OLYMPIA, WA TRACED THE PROBLEM TO A COMPUTER MODULE.  THIS MODULE IS ON NATIONAL BACKORDER WITH NO DELIVERY DATE IN SIGHT.    I AM ON MY WAY TO ALASKA, AND AM STUCK IN OLYMPIA, WA FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG.    THE TRUCK IS IN PERFECT WORKING ORDER, EXCEPT THAT IT IS PROGRAMMED TO STOP (OR GO 5MPH) AFTER 200 MILES UNLESS THE DEF PROBLEM IS FIXED.",

        "summary": "LIFE AND DEATH SITUATION:  THE 2016 2500 RAM DIESEL TRUCK HAS A PROBLEM THAT CAUSES IT TO DO A COMPLETE ELECTRICAL SHUTDOWN WHILE DRIVING. A COMPLETE LOSS OF ALL ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS ARE LOST, INCLUDING A... COMPLETE ENGINE FAILURE... BRAKE LIGHTS... POWER STEERING... POWER BRAKES.  EVERYTHING DIES WITH NO WARNING. JUST DEAD!  FIAT DODGE RAM KNOWS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND ARE ALLOWING THESE VEHICLES TO BE SOLD TO AN UNKNOWING PUBLIC. THE REASON I KNOW THIS IS BECAUSE WHEN THE DEALER CALLED THE STAR HOT LINE AT RAM THEY WERE TOLD EXACTLY WHERE TO GO TO FIND THE PROBLEM!!! THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS FAILURES TO DATE.   THIS WILL GET PEOPLE KILLED.   THE 2016 RAMS HAVE ONLY BEEN ON THE ROAD FOR A MONTH. I OWN ONE AND MY VEHICLE IS PRESENTLY IN THE SHOP FOR REPAIR AFTER 10 ENGINE FAILURES!!!! WHEN THERE WERE NO FAILURE CODES ON MY RAM 2500.. AND.. IT FAILED AND SHUT DOWN  ON THE TECH WHEN BACKING IT OUT OF THE BAY THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM ME AS UNSAFE TO DRIVE. THAT WAS A WEEK AGO.  IT IS STILL STUCK IN THE SAME BAY AS IT WILL NOT CRANK.  PROBLEM:  TIPM TOTALLY INTEGRATED POWER MODULE OR PDC INTEL PWR. PART  # 68243265AD IS THE PROBLEM. THE MAIN TERMINAL INPUT CARRYING ALL ELECTRICAL POWER INTO THE VEHICLE IS BEING OVER TORQUED DURING MANUFACTURE. THIS IS CAUSING THE TERMINAL TO SNAP AND ONLY GIVE INTERMITTING POWER TO THE VEHICLE DURING OPERATION AND CAUSING THE TOTAL SHUT OF THE VEHICLE'S COMPUTERS AND SHUTDOWN OF THE VEHICLE.  IN ADDITION TO THE THIS PROBLEM WHICH COULD CAUSE POSSIBLE DEATH, THE CONSTANT ARCING OF THE COMPUTERS HAS NOW CAUSED ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS TO MY VEHICLE.   THERE IS NOW A FAILURE IN THE IGNITION SWITCH MODULE PART # 68271986AA AND IT HAS A ESD  OF FEB 2016.    I'LL DEAL WITH MY VEHICLE.. BUT ALLOWING THESE 8000# VEHICLES ON THE ROAD WITH THIS PROBLEM IS INEXCUSABLE WHEN DODGE RAM  KNOWS THEY HAVE THIS SAFETY ISSUE. ....UPDATED 12/30/15 *BF  UPDATED 05/21/18*JB",
