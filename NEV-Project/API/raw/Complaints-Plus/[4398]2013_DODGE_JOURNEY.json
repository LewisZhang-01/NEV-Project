I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT WHILE UNDER WARRANTY.  IT JUST STALLED WHILE DRIVING LAST WEEK FOR A SECOND TIME. I WAS WAITING ON A LIGHT ON A CITY STREET. MY CAR WAS COMPLETELY DEAD I COULDN'T PUT THE HAZARD LIGHTS ON. I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A SCHOOL ZONE. I TRIED STARTING IT AND NOTHING. TWO GENTLEMEN HAD TO PUSH MY CAR OUT OF TRAFFIC.  THIS IS VERY UNSAFE,  IMAGINE HAD I BEEN ON THE HIGHWAY SOMEONE WOULD OF HIT FROM ME BEHIND AS I HAD NO POWER AT ALL. THERE WAS NO WAY OF WARNING THE CARS BEHIND ME AS I HAD NO POWER.  I REPLACED THE BATTERY IN 1/2021 AND ALTERNATOR IN 3/2021.   I HAVE SEEN MANY COMPLAINTS ON THE DODGE FORUM WEBSITE I BELIEVE SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE FOR SAFETY ISSUES.  ALSO MY BLUETOOTH SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING THAT IS ALSO A SAFETY ISSUE. I DID COMPLAIN TO DODGE AND THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.   I HAVE SEEN A LOT  OF COMPLAINTS ON THE DODGE FORUM WEBSITE.  MY DODGE JOURNEY IS CURRENTLY AT A SHOP UNDER DIAGNOSTICS. IT MAKES IT UNSAFE FOR ME TO WANT TO DRIVE IT AT THIS POINT.",

THIS PROVES THAT THERE IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT IN THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT. EVEN WORSE, THIS FAILURE CAN CAUSE MAJOR TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS. NOT ONLY IS DODGE RISKING MY FAMILY'S SAFETY, BUT THEY RISK THE SAFETY OF OTHER DRIVERS TRAVELING NEAR ANY OF THEIR THOUSANDS OF FAULTY VEHICLES, AND THE TOW TRUCK DRIVERS WHO HAVE TO TOW THE BROKEN DOWN VEHICLES.

THEN IN NOVEMBER OF 2019 MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, I TOOK IT TO A LOCAL AUTO PARTS STORE AND HAD THEM RUN A DIAGNOSTIC ON IT, WHICH CAME BACK THAT THE CRANK SHAFT POSITION SENSOR NEED SOME ATTENTION.

WINTER ENSUED AND NOTICED THAT PRESSURE WAS DECREASING IN ONE OF THE TIRES. UNABLE TO LOCATE A NITROGEN SERVICE, WAS FORCED TO INFLATE WITH AIR. AFTER ABOUT A WEEK, FOUND SAME TIRE TO STILL BE LOSING AIR; DUE TO THE CONTINUING SUB ZERO TEMPS, I FIGURED IT WAS NORMAL COLD WEATHER PRESSURE LOSS. STILL LOSING PRESSURE, REMOVED TIRE AND FOUND A LEAK IN THE TREAD, TIRE WAS PLUGGED, INFLATED, LEAK CHECKED AND PLACED BACK IN SERVICE. DURING THE 2014 AND 2015 WINTERS, ALL TIRES REQUIRED FREQUENT AIR SERVICE, BUT NEVER REQUIRED A PRESSURE REDUCTION. MAY 2015 THE ONE CULPRIT TIRE WAS REQUIRING WEEKLY AIR SERVICE AND BY JULY, THE TIRE WAS ROUTINELY FOUND FLAT IN THE MORNING. TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MY LOCAL TIRE SHOP AND THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE TIRE WAS NOT LEAKING FROM  THE PATCH, BUT WAS HOWEVER LEAKING FORM THE INNER SIDEWALL WHERE THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT BULGE AND BELT SEPARATION. THEY IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE TIRE OUT OF SERVICE AND INSPECTED THE OTHER THREE, THEY FOUND BULGES IN TWO OF THE OTHER TIRES SIDEWALL'S AND RECOMMENDED REPLACING ALL FOUR AT 20,000 MILES. THEY INDICATED THAT THEY HAD STOPPED CARRYING KUMHO'S BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY ISSUES. THIS IS A 60,000 MILE RATED TIRE WITH AN OBVIOUS ENGINEERING FLAW. IT NEEDS TO BE RECALLED IMMEDIATELY.",
