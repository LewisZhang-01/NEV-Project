        "summary": "WHEN WE BOUGHT THE VAN NEW FROM THE DEALER, I ASKED THE DEALER ABOUT THE KNOWN POWER STEERING HOSE ISSUE. THE ISSUE IS THAT ONE OF THE POWER STEERING FLUID HOSES IS TOO SHORT & IT WORKS ITS WAY OUT OF POSITION UNTIL IT POPS OFF & FLUID SPRAYS OUT, RESULTING IN A LOSS OF STEERING CONTROL. I KNEW ABOUT IT BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY REPORTS ON THE INTERNET OF THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. THE DEALER DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THIS ISSUE. I WENT BACK FOR SERVICE A YEAR LATER & SHOWED THEM THE HOSE SLIPPING OFF, THEY DID NOT CARE & DID NOTHING ABOUT IT. DESPITE ME DILIGENTLY CHECKING & REPOSITIONING THE HOSE WHENEVER IT STARTED TO SLIP OUT OF PLACE, WHICH WAS VERY FREQUENTLY, IT FINALLY POPPED OFF ON US WHILE WE WERE DRIVING ON A NARROW TWISTY HIGHWAY & WE LOST STEERING CONTROL. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS ISSUE. IN THE ATTACHED PHOTO, TAKEN AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, YOU CAN SEE THE LOWER HOSE OUT OF POSITION, IT SHOULD BE WHERE THE UPPER HOSE IS RELATIVE TO THE METAL PIPE.",
