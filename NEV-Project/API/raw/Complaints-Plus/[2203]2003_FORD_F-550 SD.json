THE CONSUMER HAD  BEEN DRIVING COMMERCIALLY SINCE 1967 AND HAS NOT HAD ANY MAJOR WRECKS THAT CAUSED  INJURIES.  WHEN THE CONSUMER RETURNED HOME, HE CALLED FORDS SERVICE DEPARTMENT, AND THEY GAVE HIM THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM.  THERE WAS IRRITATION ON THE TOP OF THE CONSUMER'S PER PICTURES.  SINCE THE ACCIDENT THE CONSUMER SPOKE WITH SOME FORD EXPLORER AND EXPEDITION OWNERS THAT EXPERIENCED THE SAME SEAT BELT PROBLEMS AND DO NOT WEAR THEIR SEAT BELTS.
