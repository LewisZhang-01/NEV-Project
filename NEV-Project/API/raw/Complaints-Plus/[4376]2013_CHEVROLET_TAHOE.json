A cycle of the ignition system will reset the system a majority of the time.    There is no \"recall\" but the general consensus in the mechanical world is two things cause this issue.  Throttle body is bad and/or the steering position sensor fails causing the stabilitrak system to be disabled (which in a 2013 Tahoe, stabilitrak cannot be turned off)   I have replaced the throttle body with an OEM part and the problem still occurs with our vehicle.  It is a big enough of a parts failure/equipment failure that most of my mechanic buddies I've talked to knew exactly what I was talking about and said I replaced these two parts and the problem was solved.  May not be enough for a recall but a TSB really should be issued because I've found a lot of information online that a lot of people are having this same issue.  Between this website's complaint section and other Chevy/GM forums, I'm estimating 5000-10000 people have had similar issues with the stabilitrak being disabled somehow while driving.     Manufacturers need to be held accountable for parts failures like this, as when recalls do finally happen, it is next to impossible to get the vehicle in and repaired in a timely matter (Takata air bag inflator issue is a great example, our local dealer cannot give me an estimated date they can get the vehicle in for repairs because its a mass parts recall and the replacement parts are unavailable)    Incident has happened over a dozen times in the past 6 months but the additional details will not let me select multiple dates",

AN HOUR LATER, WE WERE TOLD THE REPAIR WAS COMPLETE & WE ARRIVED TO PICK UP THE CAR. WHEN SIGNING THE PAPERWORK, WE NOTICED A NOTE INDICATING THAT THE DASHBOARD WAS CRACKED ON ARRIVAL.  WE IMMEDIATELY WENT OUT TO THE CAR AND FOUND 2 CRACKS IN THE DASHBOARD.  THE DASHBOARD WAS NOT CRACKED ON ARRIVAL. I HAD JUST WIPED OFF THE DASH THAT MORNING PRIOR TO BRINGING THE CAR TO THE DEALER. WE TALKED TO THE SERVICE MANAGER WHO SAID THEY TOOK PICTURES AND HAD VIDEO.  WE ASKED TO SEE SAID PICTURES AND VIDEO & ONCE THEY WENT LOOKING FOR THEM, THEY TOLD US THEY DID NOT SAVE FOR SOME REASON. WE PUSHED THE ISSUE FURTHER WITH THE GENERAL MANAGER.  THEY REFUSED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CRACKED DASH THAT OCCURRED DURING THE AIRBAG REPAIR. THEY REFUSED TO FIX MY DASHBOARD. THEY DID NOT TELL US AT ANY POINT PRIOR TO THE REPAIR THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN. I AM NOT SURE WHAT TYPE OF HAZARD THIS MAY BE TO US IN THE FUTURE BUT THE RESALE VALUE JUST TOOK A HIT.I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FOR SIMILAR TYPES OF DAMAGE FROM THIS TAKATA AIRBAG RECALL.

THE VEHICLE HAD NEW BRAKES (ROTORS, PADS AND BRAKE FLUID), 43 DAYS PRIOR.

THE ABS WARNING LIGHT WILL GO OFF, THE AIR CONDITIONER TEMPERATURE WILL RISE TO A WARM TEMP, THE LOCKS WILL START UNLOCKING AND LOCKING RANDOMLY, HARD TRANSMISSION JERKS BETWEEN FIRST AND SECOND GEAR, AND LITTLE POWER WHEN TRYING TO INCREASE SPEED.  THE FIRST TIME WE WENT, THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T FIND A PROBLEM.  THE SECOND TIME WE WENT, THEY CLEAN OUT ALL THE FUEL MODULES, THE THIRD TIME THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG.  AND FINALLY, ON THE FOURTH TRY, THE DEALER COULDN'T FIND ANY ISSUES SO THEY PUT DI-ELECTRIC GREASE ON SOME OF THE WIRING.  TWO DAYS LATER IT STARTED ACTING UP AGAIN.  A REASON THEY MAY HAVE TROUBLE FINDING ANY ISSUES IS THAT AFTER THE VEHICLE IS OFF FOR SOME TIME, IT WILL START UP AND RUN WITHOUT ANY ISSUE.   I'VE MANAGED TO GET IT OVER TO THE LOCAL AUTOZONE WHILE ALL THE PANEL WAS GOING OFF, AND POWER LOSS, AND THEY MENTIONED A FEW POSSIBLE ISSUES.  THE VEHICLES VOLTAGE REGULATOR MAY BE BAD, AS WELL AS LOSS OF COMMUNICATION FROM THE ECM AND MANY SENSORS(FUEL PUMP, TRANSMISSION, ETC...).  WE ARE LUCKY THAT WE BOUGHT AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE VEHICLE OR THIS COULD HAVE BECOME VERY COSTLY FOR US.  BUT NONE THE LESS, SAFETY IS OF A CONCERN WHEN DRIVING THE TAHOE.
