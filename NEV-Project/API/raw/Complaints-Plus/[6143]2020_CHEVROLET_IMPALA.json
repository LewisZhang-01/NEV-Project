Causing mold to grow excessively under the floor mats, in the carpets, under the seats, etc. Which as a result led to electrical issues. It\u2019s being looked into by a senior member at GM for months now, nothing is being done. Radley Chevy in Fredricksburg Virginia hasn\u2019t done anything for us either. My family is now having respiratory issues due to the mold issue.",
