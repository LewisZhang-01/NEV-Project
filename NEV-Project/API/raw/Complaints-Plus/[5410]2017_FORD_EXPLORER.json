While driving on he freeway the windshield rubber gasket on the driver side began to flap around as it has apparently lost it's full seal. I noticed much of the rubber gaskets on the door as well are loose and not properly functioning. It appears the rubber used is poor quality as this should not happen on a car that is only 4 years old. I asked the dealership and they indicated it seemed to be normal wear and tear. I can't imagine how this could be normal wear and tear on a car only 4 years old. This problem needs to be looked at as it seems Ford is using an inferior rubber product on its vehicles. This will cause harm especially from the windshield issue.",

So a new part was ordered through Ford and work was do e locally Less than 30 miles later we had the same catastrophic failure of the same part. This time my entire family including my 14 month old were in the car and we were very lucky that we were not killed but once again there were no injuries or collisions.  The part is on recall and their is no remedy part available at this time for replacement. The dealership and Ford are grossly aware and have declined to assist at this time. Ford states its the dealerships responsibility and the dealership states they can do nothing without an authorization from Ford. Because we have experienced 2 catastrophic failures that nearly killed us I think that these cars should be pulled from the road for everyone's safety. I also feel that since their is no part available to remedy the situation Ford should institute something so that owners are not without vehicles and can care for their families and go to work i am very disappointed We avoided death two times due to this recall",

We took the car to Gosch Ford of Escondido where it was purchased to have the transmission serviced and diagnose the fault. We payed for an filter and oil service for the car and at that time was informed that the transmission did not require any maintenance services until 150,000 miles and that the fault that suddenly presented itself was a torque converter fault & to change out the whole transmission at a cost of 6,000 dollars to us. We reached out to Ford headquarters to plead with them since it prematurely failed before even the first service and we were told too bad so sad for you. Being our only means of transportation my wife had to drive it a bit more to and from work at just prior to our job layoff due to the covid emergency we could not afford 6k in repairs costs and we to this day are curious since many thousands of people have had the same problem across our nation. The same problems are occurring as when your department recalled the ford edge and fusion models. We have power going through the transmission just fine and without any dash warnings whatsoever it will kick itself out of gear then slam indiscriminately back into gear causing a sever health and safety matter during operation. We plead with you to please hear our call and the ones of many many thousands on the Ford Forums that are experinecing the same.

I was also told it would cost me money to fix it. I do not feel that I should bear the financial burden to repair this problem due to faulty stitching. My service rep told me that 3 other vehicles came into the dealership with similar problems. I am willing for a Ford Motor company district service rep to inspect it and give me an acceptable solution to this dangerous issue. There was no warning of this problem.

AFTER REVIEW THEY TOLD ME IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY SINCE THE 3 YEAR, 36K MILE HAS PASSED. I WAS ALSO TOLD THE 5 YEAR/UNLIMITED MILEAGE CORROSION (PERFORATION ONLY) WOULD NOT APPLY EITHER. I WAS TOLD THE CORROSION WARRANTY WOULD ONLY APPLY IF THE CORROSION WOULD CREATE A HOLE.   AFTERWARDS I CALLED FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE (CASE # [XXX]) AND WOULD BE TOLD THE SAME AS I MENTIONED ABOVE FROM THE DEALERSHIP. AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION ON MY PART, I FOUND THERE HAVE BEEN CLASS ACTION SUITS FILED AGAINST FORD FOR THIS VERY ISSUE. THOSE COMPLAINTS SHOW THAT FORD HAS BEEN AWARE OF SUCH ISSUE AND HAS DONE LITTLE TO CORRECT. FURTHERMORE, IT IS WRITTEN THAT THE HOODS OF THE FORD EXPLORERS ARE MADE OF ALUMINUM AND WOULD NEVER RUST THROUGH TO CREATE A HOLE THEREFORE MAKING THE 5 YEAR/UNLIMITED MILEAGE CORROSION WARRANTY NEXT TO USELESS. I FEEL THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE THAT FORD IS WELL AWARE OF AND SHOULD HAVE CHANGED ITS PRACTICES AND METHODS TO AVOID FUTURE INCIDENTS. THE 'BUBBLING' PAINT MAY BE SMALL NOW BUT WILL ONLY GROW AND EVENTUALLY CRACK AND PEEL OFF NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE LOOK AND RESALE VALUE OF MY VEHICLE. I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY ASSISTANCE YOU CAN OFFER TO GET MY CAR REPAIRED AND/OR HOLD FORD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR NEGLIGENCE. THESE DEFECTS ARE SMALL AND WERE PROBABLY FORMING LONG BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO SEE THEM FOR MYSELF. *JS    PARTS OF THIS DOCUMENT HAVE BEEN REDACTED TO PROTECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",

IT'S ODD, BUT IT WAS THE SAME THING BACK THEN. IT'S THE DRIVERS, THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG. IT'S NOT OUR CARS, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M BEING TOLD NOW. IT'S MY DRIVING HABITS. THE SAME HABITS THAT DON'T EFFECT MY OTHER 5 CARS. I DID NOT BELIEVE IT THEN, NOR DO I BELIEVE IT NOW.    FORD SEEMS TO HAVE AN ODD MINDSET. TO FIND SOMETHING, YOU HAVE TO BE LOOKING FOR IT.

IT WAS FOUND THAT THE FOUR TIRES ABRASION MORE SERIOUS THAN OTHER VEHICLES UNDER NORMAL USE. IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE FOUR TIRES OF THE CAR HAD DIFFERENT PEELING SKIN PHENOMENA, AND THE TIRES HAD A SLOW LEAKING AIR PHENOMENON IN JULY 2019.  AFTER THAT, I NEED TO REPLENISH THE AIR OF TIRES 2-3 DAYS REGULARLY IN ORDER TO KEEP THE TIRE PRESSURE. I CONTACTED THE MID-TOWN FORD SALES WHERE WE BOUGHT THE CAR AFTER DISCOVERING THIS PROBLEM, UNFORTUNATELY, THEY SAID THAT THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIRE, AND LET ME CONTACT HANKOOK TIRE MANUFACTURERS TO FEEDBACK THE PROBLEM BY MYSELF. I HAVE TRIED TO CALL THE HANKOOK CUSTOMER SERVICE SEVERAL TIMES FROM JULY, BUT THERE IS NOBODY ANSWERS.  I ASKED THE LOCAL HANKOOK DEALERS IN WINNIPEG, THEY TOLD ME THAT I CAN ONLY GET FEEDBACK WITH HANKOOK HEADQUARTERS. NOW I FEEL THAT THE SKIN PEELING OF TIRES ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE SERIOUS WHEN DRIVING EVERY DAY. I AM WORRIED THAT THE TIRE WOULD BE BURST EVERY TIME WHEN I AM DRIVING. I SEARCHED ON THE INTERNET THAT THE TIRE HAD BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS FOR A LONG TIME. NHTSA ID NUMBER: 10127409 SSM: 46905. I DON'T KNOW WHY I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE FROM FORD. WHEN I WENT TO FORD 4S(MID TOWN FOR SALES), THEY SAID THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY CLUE, THEY DID NOT ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ISSUE, AND ASK ME TO I CONTACT HANKOOK, BUT THEY DID NOT GIVE ME ANY CONTACT INFORMATION FOR THE HANKOOK. THERE IS NO CLEAR CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE ON HANKOOK OFFICIAL WEBSITE. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.",

AT THE TIME I WRITE THIS COMPLAINT MY SUV IS FOR THE FOURTH TIME AT THE DEALER SHIP, FOR THE SAME PROBLEM SINCE A BOUGHT IT IN SEPTEMBER 2017: EXHAUST FUMES ENTERING THE CABIN. 3 WEEKS ALREADY SINCE I DROPPED IT AT PLANET FORD. ON 05/24/2019 I WENT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN HAVING HEADACHES, DIZZINESS AND IRRITATED EYES WHILE BEHIND THE WHEEL OF MY SUV. I HAD A CRACKED WINDSHIELD THAT ALSO NEEDED TO BE REPAIR. I WENT LAST FRIDAY, 06/07/2019, TO ASK ABOUT MY CAR AND NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON AND THE WINDSHIELD WASN'T CHANGED AT ALL. PLEASE LET ME INFORM THAT I HAVE PAID THE MOST EXPENSIVE WARRANTY THAT FORD HAS.  LAST TIME MY CAR WAS AT THE DEALER THEY REPLACED THE COMPLETE EXHAUST SYSTEM. THIS IS ONLY LIKE APPLYING A BAND-AID, IT ONLY LASTS UNTIL IT FALLS DOWN.   MY COMMUTE IS 60 MILES EVERY DAY. I DRIVE TOLL WAYS WITH SPEED LIMITS OF 75 M/PH. MY SUV SMELLS LIKE SULFUR OR EXHAUST ODOR IN THE VEHICLE CABIN. THE ODOR IS PRESENT REGARDLESS OF VENTILATION MODE (RE-CIRCULATION OR FRESH-AIR). THIS CONDITION MAY BE WORSENED WHEN THE VEHICLE IS HEAVILY ACCELERATED TO PASS TRAFFIC OR CARS OR FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF ACCELERATION, WHICH IS LOGICAL IF A DRIVE MORE THAN 54 MILES OF MY COMMUTE ON HIGHWAYS.  IN THE FORD EXPLORER OWNER'S MANUAL YOU CAN READ: 'DO NOT DRIVE YOUR VEHICLE IF YOU SMELL EXHAUST FUMES. CARBON MONOXIDE IS PRESENT IN EXHAUST FUMES. TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ITS DANGEROUS EFFECTS.'  THE SUV HAD BEEN TO THE DEALER SEVERAL TIMES WITHOUT RESOLUTION. THIS SUV IT IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN FOR ME, THAT I DRIVE IT MORE THAN 300 MILES PER WEEK AND MY CHILDREN THAT ACCOMPANY ME AT THE BACK SEAT WERE THE 'SMELL' IS EVEN WORSE.  COMPLAINTS FOR FUMES IN THE CABIN:   1 I WAS TOLD THAT I SHOULD USE THE A/C ON RE-CIRCULATION. NOTHING WAS WRONG  2 CHANGED A VALVE  3.CHANGED THE EXHAUST SYSTEM.  4. 3 WEEKS IN THE DEALER 05/24/2019.",

WE ALREADY HAD THE RECALL FIXED FOR THE EXHAUST SYSTEM CYCLING BACK INTO THE CAR SO THIS IS ALARMING. IT GOT PROGRESSIVELY WORSE AS THE WEEKS PASSED AND THE PLUMES BECAME THICKER AND VERY SMELLY. WHEN I EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM THEY TOOK IT INTO THE SHOP. ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER TAKING IT BACK INTO THE SHOP THE SERVICE MANAGER CAME BACK TO ME AND SAID THAT HE AND 2 OTHER TECHS PERSONALLY ENDED UP LOOKING AT IT AND AGREE THEY BELIEVE IT IS THE TURBO. I AM TAKING IT BACK IN TODAY JUNE 3, 2019 AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD BE TAKING APART THE ENTIRE EXHAUST SYSTEM AND ENGINE TO FIX IT. I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS EXACT PROBLEM THAT POSTED JANUARY 23, 2017 COVERING ONLY 1163 2017 FORD EXPLORERS( NHTSA CAMPAIGN #16V925000). I CALLED FORD AND REPORT AND WHAT HAS BEEN OCCURING, WHAT WAS SAID, AND MY CONCERNS ON MAY 30, 3019. I EXPLAINED MY CONCERNS ABOUT THEM POSSIBLY MISSING SOME CARS AND PUTTING US AT RISK. THEY NOTATED IT, BUT WERE ADAMANT THAT MY EXPLORER IS NOT INVOLVED. TODAY, JUNE 3 2019, I WILL BE DROPPING MY EXPLORER OFF AT HEALEY AND THEY WILL HAVE IT FOR A FEW DAYS. I AM HOPING NHTSA WILL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK INTO THIS RECALL AND REALLY MAKE SURE ALL CARS THAT HAVE THE ISSUE ARE COVERED. IT'S A DANGEROUS RECALL AND I BELIEVE SOME HAVE BEEN MISSED AND FORD IS NOT LOOKING INTO IT FURTHER WHICH PUTS PEOPLE'S LIVES AT RISK.

I'M HORRIFIED TO THINK ABOUT THE EXPOSURE I'VE HAD FOR THE LAST 2.5 YEARS. I TOOK THE VEHICLE INTO FORD TO CORRECT THE \"POTENTIAL\" ISSUE.  A FEW DAYS AFTER PICKING IT UP, THE DETECTOR WENT OFF AGAIN, REGISTERING 10 PPM'S. I WAS ON A 2.5 HOUR TRIP HOME AND HAD TO ROLL THE WINDOWS DOWN 6 TIMES BECAUSE THE DETECTOR KEPT GOING OFF.",

THE PROBLEM IS FORD IS CHARGING THE CONSUMER THE COST OF LABOR THE COST OF TAXES  AND 70% THE COST OF THE TIRE. I BELIEVE WHEN THERE'S A DEFECTIVE TIRE OR ANY COMPONENT IN THE CAR THE SALES VENDOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REPLACING THE DEFECTIVE PART. FURTHERMORE I BELIEVE THE SALES VENDOR FORD SHOULD MITIGATE THE PROBLEM WITH THESE TIRES TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS THEY ARE SELLING TO. THIS IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS CASE AND MANY OTHER CASES. THE REASON I FOUND OUT MY TIRE TRADE-IN WAS LOW , WAS I PROCEEDED TO STOP MY CAR AT A STOP SIGN WHERE THERE WAS WATER OVERFLOWING AND I HYDROPLANED THROUGH THE INTERSECTION WITH MY YOUNG KIDS IN THE BACKSEAT.

THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN AND SHE HAD JUST GOTTEN THROUGH THE INTERSECTION WHEN A VEHICLE THAT WAS HEADING SOUTH, LOST CONTROL AND HIT HER HEAD-ON.  THE ATTACHED PICTURE SHOWS THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE SUSTAINED ON THE FRONT END OF THE VEHICLE.  BEYOND THIS DAMAGE, THE IMPACT WAS STRONG ENOUGH THAT A MOTOR MOUNT MOUNTING PIN WAS SHEARED CLEAN OFF THE MOTOR AS WAS THE COVER ON THE TIMING BELT.  THE REBAR IN FRONT OF THE RADIATOR WAS SNAPPED COMPLETELY IN HALF.  ALL THIS DAMAGE...AND THE AND AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.  THERE WAS SUFFICIENT DAMAGE THAT THIS $50,000+ VEHICLE WAS CONSIDERED A TOTAL LOSS.    I'VE CONTACTED THE FORD DEALERSHIP IN SIOUX FALLS, SD WHERE WE BOUGHT THE VEHICLE.  AS SOON AS I MENTIONED AIRBAGS, THEY SAID THEY WOULD NOT ADDRESS OR COMMENT ON ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS I RAISED ABOUT THE VEHICLE SAFETY FEATURES.  I'VE CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY DIRECT.  SAME STORY.  AS SOON AS THE SUBJECT OF AIRBAGS WAS LOCKED FIRMLY IN THE MIND OF THE LADY I WAS TALKING WITH, SHE PROCEEDED WITH ABOUT TEN MINUTES OF QUESTIONS.  AFTER SPENDING PROBABLY 20 MINUTES ON THE PHONE WITH THIS LADY, ALL I GOT WAS, \"YOU NOW HAVE A CASE NUMBER IN OUR SYSTEM.\"  WHEN I ASKED ABOUT GETTING ANY FOLLOWUP CORRESPONDENCE, I WAS TOLD, \"ALL FUTURE CORRESPONDENCE WILL BE BETWEEN THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND FORD MOTOR COMPANY.\"  AND, I'VE HEARD NOTHING SINCE.

MY FAMILY AND I HAD PULLED OVER AND PARKED IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA TO GET ITEMS OUT FROM THE REAR STORAGE AREA.  I HAD OPENED THE HATCH WITH THE ELECTRONIC SWITCH AND THE DOOR STOPPED ABOUT 2/3 OF THE WAY UP.  AS THIS HAD HAPPENED TO ME PREVIOUSLY, I FOLLOWED THE MANUAL DIRECTIONS TO SET THE LIFTGATE OPEN HEIGHT.  WE FINISHED GETTING OUR ITEMS OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND PRESSED THE CONTROL BUTTON TO CLOSE.  IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT THE LIFTGATE--NOW AT MAXIMUM HEIGHT--SIMPLY MADE \"WHIRRING\" SOUNDS AND WOULD NOT CLOSE.  DESPITE REFERENCING THE OWNER'S MANUAL, CALLING FORD ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND SCOURING THE INTERNET FOR POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS, ALL ATTEMPTS TO BYPASS THE ELECTRONIC SYSTEM/MOTOR AND MANUALLY CLOSE THE DOOR WERE UNSUCCESSFUL.  I WAS FORCED TO DRIVE MY FAMILY HOME WITH THE REAR LIFTGATE PRECARIOUSLY LEFT WIDE OPEN.  THE NEXT DAY I WAS ADVISED BY MY LEASING COMPANY TO HAVE A TOW TRUCK PICK THE VEHICLE FOR SAFETY REASONS.  THE TOW DRIVER WAS SHOCKED AT THIS ODD MALFUNCTION AND EXPRESSED CONCERN TRANSPORTING THE VEHICLE AS ROAD BUMPS COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE EXCESSIVE BOUNCING AND PERMANENT DAMAGE.  WE DETACHED THE LIFT ARMS HOLDING UP THE REAR GATE SO AS TO CLOSE THE DOOR--ONLY TO FIND THAT THE REAR HATCH STILL WOULD NOT FULLY CLOSE.  THE REPORT FROM THE FORD DEALERSHIP HERE IN PHOENIX WAS SIMPLY THAT THE \"LIFTGATE WOULD NOT CLOSE MANUALLY DUE TO THE MOTOR BINDING.\"  THEY SUBSEQUENTLY REPLACED THE MOTOR AND NOTED THE \"SYSTEM IS NOW WORKING AS DESIGNED AT THIS TIME.\"  I ASKED MY ADVISOR IF THERE WAS A MANUAL OVERRIDE FOR THIS  AND HE SAID \"NO.\"   I BELIEVE THAT FORD SHOULD CONDUCT A SAFETY RECALL OF THESE LIFTGATE COMPONENTS AND ENGINEER A MANUAL OVERRIDE FOR WHEN THEY GO OUT.",

I FIND IT VERY DISTURBING THAT FORD IS TRYING TO EXPLAIN THIS AS A PROBLEM WITH ONLY THE POLICE INTERCEPTOR EXPLORERS DUE TO AFTER MARKET MODIFICATIONS.  MY EXPERIENCE INDICATES THAT THIS IS A COMPLETELY FALSE AND MISLEADING EXPLANATION.  I AM VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT THE NHTSA IS DOING AN EA ON THE PROBLEM.

WE FOUND THAT IT ONLY TOOK 15-20 MINUTES OF HIGHWAY DRIVING FOR THE DETECTOR TO DISPLAY 31PPM, THE DETECTORS MINIMUM CONCENTRATION DETECTION THRESHOLD. THE LEVEL WOULD THEN BUILD OVER TIME. DUE TO THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF CO ON THE HUMAN BODY I NEVER LET THE CONCENTRATION EXCEED 62PPM. I FOUND, HOWEVER, THAT THE PEAK CO CONCENTRATION DETECTED WAS 103PPM.

LIKE MANY, WHO HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS VEHICLE I AM GETTING NAUSEA, WEAKNESS, AND TENSION HEADACHES FROM DRIVING THIS VEHICLE. I HAVE BEEN VERY WEAK AND HAVING HEADACHES, AS OF LATE. THIS HAS HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON MY DAY-TO-DAY LIFE. I COULDN'T EXPLAIN WHY OR WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH ME IT SEEMED AS IF IT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. I AM STARTING TO THINK MAYBE I HAVE LONG TERM EXPOSURE TO CARBON MONOXIDE OVER THE LAST 3 WEEKS. I GOT THE FORD EXPLORE 3 WEEKS AGO AND THIS SUDDEN SICKNESS HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE THEN. I GOT SO WORRIED WITH MY HEALTH\"I WENT TO THE DOCTOR. I EXPLAINED TO THE DOCTOR \"I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT'S GOING ON WITH ME BUT I FEEL ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE HAD A FLU FOR ALMOST A MONTH\". I WAS DESPERATE AND I KNOW I SOUNDED CRAZY BUT I HAVE BEEN HAVING SOME SERIOUS BOUTS WITH WEAKNESS, FATIGUE, AND HEADACHES.     I WENT TO THE DOCTOR ON JULY 31ST 2017 AND I REALLY HAVE BEEN BAFFLED BY THE SUDDEN ONSET OF SYMPTOMS.  THIS WAS BEFORE I KNEW ABOUT THE NHTSA INVESTIGATION INTO THE 2017 FORD EXPLORER. I SAW THE STORY RUN TODAY (8-3-17) ON GOOD MORNING AMERICA AND I STARTED TO PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER.   AT THE DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT ON (7-31-17) THEY PULLED BLOOD, AND ARE CONDUCTING A BUNCH OF TEST BUT NOTHING HAS COME BACK.

EVEN IF I WOULD MAKE IT OUT BEFORE GETTING RUN OVER, MY BABY IN A CAR SEAT IN THE BACK OF THE CAR WOULD BE ROLLED INTO THE BUSY STREET WITHIN A MATTER OF SECONDS!!

NEITHER OF THESE ACTIONS RESOLVED THE ISSUE, I HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT A POLICE OFFICER IN THE US PASSED OUT DRIVING A FORD EXPLORER HAVING THE SAME ISSUES. I HAVE A WIFE AND TWO SMALL CHILDREN AND I FEAR FOR THEIR SAFETY GIVEN THE TOXIC FUMES CONTAINED IN AUTOMOTIVE EXHAUST.",

THIS VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO FORD FOR DIAGNOSIS ON MARCH 6, 2017 WHERE IT SAT UNTIL MAY 17, 2017 AFTER WE CONDUCTED PRELIMINARY AIR QUALITY TEST SHOWING TVOC'S COMING OUT OF THE VENTS WHEN THE AIR WAS IN RECIRCULATION MODE.  THIS HAPPENED WHETHER THE VEHICLE WAS IDLING, IN CITY DRIVING AND HIGHWAY DRIVING.  THE FORD DEALER COMPLETED ALL OF THEIR DIAGNOSTICS, UPDATED THE HVAC SYSTEM TO THE MOST CURRENT AND STATED THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT TO DO. ON MAY 17TH WE COMPLETED A MORE EXTENSIVE TEST AND SENT THAT TO AN INDEPENDENT LAB.  AT THAT TIME ALL FOUR VEHICLES WERE MOVED TO A GARAGE FOR PASSIVE AIRING OUT AT FORDS DIRECTION.  WE WERE TO LEAVE THEM A MINIMUM OF 10 DAYS AND THEN PLACE CHARCOAL FILTERS AND SILICA PACKS IN THE VEHICLES TO HELP ABSORB FUMES IF ANY WERE LEFT.  WE COMPLETED A NEW AIR QUALITY TEST AND FOUND THAT IT WAS STILL SHOWING TVOC'S BEING PUT OUT OF THE VENTS AND WAS NOW SHOWING CARBON MONOXIDE.  AFTER THESE RESULTS WERE PASSED ON WE  WERE NOTIFIED BY FORD THAT THIS WAS NOT A NEW CAR ISSUE AND THAT IT WAS DEFINITELY A PROBLEM.  WE WERE INSTRUCTED NOT TO DRIVE THE CARS IN RECIRCULATION MODE.  I EXPLAINED THAT UNLESS YOU REMEMBER TO TURN THIS OFF IT IS AUTOMATICALLY ON AND I WAS THEN INSTRUCTED NOT TO ALLOW ANYONE TO DRIVE THEM.  TODAY I RECEIVED AN EMAIL STATING THEY HAVE A \"SOLUTION\".
