I CONTACTED PEP BOYS WHERE THE PRODUCT WAS PURCHASED AND THEY TOLD ME THEY DO NOT SERVICE THIS PRODUCT AND TO CONTACT BAJA MOTOR PRODUCTS WHICH BOUGHT PANTERRA .  WHEN I CONTACTED BAJA THEY TOLD ME BECAUSE OF THE RECENT ACQUISITION THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE MANUALS AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE ME WITH TO TROUBLE SHOOT THE PROBLEM.  I HAD ALREADY TAKEN IT TO A LOCAL MOTORCYCLE/SCOOTER REPAIR SHOW AND THE OWNER MADE THE COMMENT THAT \"BAJA\" WAS TERRIBLE TO DEAL WITH SO I WASN'T EXPECTING A MIRACLE, BUT I WAS HOPING FOR SOME ASSISTANCE.  THE EMPLOYEE DID SAID THEY WERE EXPECTING TO HAVE MANUALS IN ABOUT 4 WEEKS AND SUGGESTED THAT I CALL BACK.  WHEN I CALLED BACK FOUR WEEKS LATER THE EMPLOYEE TOLD ME THEY WOULD PUT ONE IN THE MAIL AND I SHOULD HAVE IT IN APPROXIMATELY 15 DAYS.  I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE ONE AND IT IS ALMOST A YEAR LATER.  OUT OF FRUSTRATION MY HUSBAND HAS CALLED ALMOST EVERY MOTORCYCLE REPAIR SHOP IN OUR CITY AND NO ONE IS WILLING TO WORK ON IT.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY PROBLEM!  WHILE I CAN MANUALLY USE MY HANDS TO SIGNAL A TURN, I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO.  THE BRAKE LIGHT CONSTANTLY STAYING ON PRESENTS ANOTHER SAFETY ISSUE IN THAT SOMEONE RIDING BEHIND ME MAY NOT REALIZE WHEN I AM REALLY BRAKING TO STOP THE VEHICLE. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE RECALLED TO OPERATE SAFELY ON THE ROAD WITHOUT DEFECTS SINCE THEY SELL IT AS A STREET LEGAL PRODUCT OR THE CONSUMERS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO HAVE THEIR MONEY REFUNDED FROM THE ORIGINAL SELLER (PEPBOYS) SINCE IT CANNOT OPERATE SAFELY ON THE ROAD AS IT IS SOLD.    *JB",
