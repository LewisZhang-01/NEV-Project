I LIVE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF MY MOTORHOME INCLUDING COVERING THE TIRES WHEN IN STORAGE WHICH IS THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME.  I'VE TRIED TO CONTACT MICHELIN FOR A RECALL BUT NOTHING.  EACH TIRE IS APPROX. $400-500 AND I'M BEING TOLD I NEED TO REPLACE ALL SIX TIRES.  WITH AS LOW MILEAGE AS I DRIVE MY RV I AM DISGUSTED AT THE FACT THAT THESE EXPENSIVE TIRES ALREADY NEED REPLACEMENT.  PLEASE HELP....  *TR",
