UPON INVESTIGATING WHERE THE GASOLINE SMELL WAS ORIGINATING, I FOUND IT HAD DEVELOPED A VERY LARGE FUEL LEAK FROM WHICH FUEL COULD BE SEEN DRIPPING ON THE FORWARD, LEFT SIDE OF THE FUEL TANK.   AFTER PERFORMING SOME BRIEF RESEARCH, I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE PASSAT 4-MOTIONS, DATED APRIL 2008, IN REGARDS TO A VENTILATION VALVE ON THE FUEL TANK. I PROMPTLY MADE A APPOINTMENT WITH MY LOCAL VW DEALER FOR DEC 4TH. ON DECEMBER 6, 2017, I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP ASKING JAY, THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE VW DEALERSHIP, IF THEY FOUND THE VENT VALVE TO BE LEAKING. I WAS TOLD THAT THE VALVE WAS IN FACT LEAKING AT THE BONDED VALVE POINT. AFTER HEARING NOTHING THE NEXT TWO DAYS, I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM VW STATING THAT THEY FOUND THE UNDER-BODY DAMAGE TO BE THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK. I REQUESTED TO SEE THE PICTURES OF THE DAMAGE SO THAT I COULD EXAMINE THEM MYSELF.  ON DECEMBER 11, 2017, I RECEIVED THE PICTURES FROM THE SERVICE MANAGER SHOWING THE HEAT SHIELDS SURROUNDING THE TANK TO HAVE SOME BRUSH MARKS AND TO BE DISFIGURED A BIT. PLEASE KEEP IN MIND, THIS WAS A KNOWN ISSUE IN THE EARLY 2000'S, AND THE VEHICLE IS NOW 15 YEARS OLD WITH 127,000 MILES ON IT AND THE RECALL HAD BEEN COMPLETED. THIS \"DAMAGE\" WOULD NOT LEAD TO A FUEL TANK LEAK AS THE FUEL TANK ITSELF WAS NOT DAMAGED.  VERY UPSET, I WROTE TO THE REGIONAL CASE MANAGER ON DEC 11, 2017 WITH MY THOUGHTS ON THE DAMAGE AND TO GET MORE DETAILS ON THE CASE. I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE A RESPONSE.",

THE FLOODED PLENUM APPEARS TO HAVE RESULTED IN WATER BEING DRAWN THROUGH THE VACUUM LINES WHEN ATTEMPTING TO BRAKE.  THIS, IN TURN, CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WATER TO BE DRAWN INTO THE CRANKCASE.  WATER WAS ALSO DRAWN INTO THE CYLINDERS RESULTING IN MISFIRING. AFTER REMOVING AT LEAST ONE DRAIN PLUG IN THE PLENUM FOR PROPER DRAINAGE, AND DOUBLE FLUSHING THE CONTAMINATED OIL IN THE CRANKCASE, I EXPERIENCED NO FURTHER BRAKING PROBLEMS UNTIL FREEZING WEATHER IN NOVEMBER 2013.  IN NOVEMBER, WHILE BRAKING NEAR THE BOTTOM OF A HILL, I AGAIN EXPERIENCED A HARD PEDAL WITH NO DEPRESSION AND ALMOST NO BRAKING ABILITY, RESULTING IN THE CAR GOING INTO THE INTERSECTION BEFORE FULLY STOPPING.  THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE VOLKSWAGEN DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR. TWO WEEKS LATER, THERE WAS AGAIN THE SYMPTOM OF A HARD PEDAL? WITH NO DEPRESSION AND NEAR LOSS OF ALL BRAKING.  THE CAR WAS AGAIN RETURNED TO THE VOLKSWAGEN DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR.  THIS TIME, THE VACUUM BOOSTER, THE VACUUM PIPES, AND THEIR RELATED ITEMS WERE REPLACED.  AS NOTED IN THE DEALERSHIP INVOICE, EVIDENCE OF WATER WAS FOUND IN THE REPLACED VACUUM BOOSTER.  THE DEALERSHIP ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE PLENUM HAD A SIGNIFICANT HIGH-WATER POLLEN LINE, INDICATING FLOODING OF THE PLENUM.  IT WAS BELIEVED BY THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT STAFF THAT THE BRAKE FAILURES IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2013 WERE LIKELY THE RESULT OF RESIDUAL WATER FREEZING IN THE VACUUM BOOSTER, CAUSING THE BOOSTER TO BE INOPERATIVE.   ALSO, THE IGNITION COILS WERE REPLACED. UPDATED 01/30/14  THE CONSUMER STATED THE INSUFFICIENT FIX DURING THE 2008 CAMPAIGN DID NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. IT ALLOWED FOR CONTINUED FLOODING OF THE PLENUM COMPARTMENT AND SUBSEQUENT BRAKE FAILURES. UPDATED 02/19/14  UPDATED 03/13/14  UPDATED 05/12/14  UPDATED 06/25/14",

THESE VEHICLES MAY HAVE AN UNDERBODY HEAT SHIELD THAT CAN BECOME DAMAGED.

CONSEQUENCE: A HEAT SHIELD THAT MAY CONTACT THE EXHAUST SYSTEM CAN RESULT IN A VEHICLE FIRE. IN ADDITION, A FUEL LEAK FROM A FUEL LINE OR FUEL TANK VENTILATION VALVE, IN THE PRESENCE OF AN IGNITION SOURCE, CAN LEAD TO A VEHICLE FIRE.     REMEDY: DEALERS WILL INSTALL ADDITIONAL UNDERBODY HEAT SHIELDS ON VEHICLES WITH AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS TO COVER THE POSSIBLY DAMAGED AREAS. DEALERS WILL ALSO INSPECT THE FUEL TANK VENTILATION VALVE ON 4MOTION/ALL WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLES, AND REPLACE COMPONENTS IF NECESSARY FREE OF CHARGE. THE RECALL BEGAN ON JUNE 13, 2008.     FAST FWD TO 2013.  OUR GAS TANK IS NOW LEAKING OUT AND THERE'S EVERY INDICATION IT'S A VENTILATION VALVE.

IN THE TIME THAT I'VE HAD THIS VEHICLE, I'VE HAD THE FOLLOWING INCIDENTS OCCUR:    1. HAVE A CONTROL UNIT REPLACED (HORN NOT WORKING, UNABLE TO ROLL DOWN WINDOWS, ETC..)    2. REPLACE IGNITION COIL (STOP MOTOR STATUS LIGHT COMING ON AS I'M DRIVING IN THE MIDST OF TRAFFIC)    3. HAD UNDERSHIELD FALL FORWARD AS I WAS DRIVING ON THE STATE HIGHWAY, PRETTY MUCH SCOOPING UP POTENTIAL DEBRIS FROM THE ROADWAY SURFACE.    4. DAMAGE TO ENGINE FROM OIL SLUDGE AND OIL PUMP REPLACEMENT NO LESS THAN THREE TIMES. (STOP MOTOR LIGHT AGAIN)    5.

IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT THE QUALITY OF THESE VEHICLES WAS SUBSTANTIALLY SUB-PAR AND POORLY DESIGNED ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.      THE CAR IS CURRENTLY IN MY PARENTS DRIVEWAY, AS THE LAST TIME THE OIL PUMP WENT CAUSED SO MANY ISSUES THAT I ENDED UP NOT BEING ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR (LIVE AND WORK OUT OF STATE NOW AND REGISTRATION EXPIRED THE SAME MONTH THE PUMP WENT THEN COULDN'T AFFORD INSURANCE AFTER REPAIRS).     TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, I DIDN'T RECEIVE THE CLAIM NOTICE ABOUT FIXING THE SUNROOF ISSUE UNTIL A YEAR LATER, AS IT WENT TO MY OLD ADDRESS AND NOW IT'S TOO LATE TO EVEN FILE THE CLAIM.

I TRIED STARTING THE CAR AGAIN AND IT WOULD NOT CRANK.  ONCE THE POLICE CAME, HE PUSHED MY CAR INTO SAFETY AND AWAITED THE TOW TRUCK. MY CAR WAS TOWED TO THE VW DEALER.  THIS MORNING, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE DEALER WHO SAID THE FUEL FLOW TO THE ENGINE WAS INTERRUPTED AND CAUSED BY A INOPERATIVE FUEL PUMP. MY COMPLAINT IS WHEN I CHECKED ONLINE FOR RECALLS, I FOUND A RECALL THAT WAS POSTED IN SEPT 2002 FOR THE SAME ISSUE I AM HAVING WITH MY CAR.  MY CAR WAS PURCHASED IN FEB 2002 AND THE RECALL IS FOR 2003 MODELS.  I CALLED VW OF AMERICA AND EXPLAINED THE ISSUE WITH THEM AND THE ONLY OFFER THEY GAVE ME WAS $1000 TOWARDS A NEW VW.  UNBELIEVABLE! BECAUSE THE RECALL WAS FOR 2003 MODELS, THEY COULD NOT ASSIST ME BECAUSE MY VEHICLE IS A 2002.  EVEN THOUGH I AM HAVING THE SAME ISSUES WITH MY VEHICLE AS THE 2003 RECALL.  THE DEALER QUOTED $589 FOR THE REPAIR.  THIS STALL COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE THAN IT WAS DUE TO THE INCLEMENT WEATHER, NIGHT TIME AND THE EXIT RAMP.  THIS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN A SAFETY RECALL BECAUSE THERE IS NO WARNING BEFORE THE VEHICLE CUTS OFF WHICH CAUSES A POTENTIAL FOR A CRASH, WHICH IS WHAT I WAS FACED WITH LAST NIGHT.  I AM NOT ASKING TO BE SINGLED OUT, BUT TO LOOK INTO THIS 6-MONTH GAP OF THE RECALL IN SEPT 2002 AND THE PURCHASE DATE OF MY VEHICLE FEB 2002.  I WAS ALSO TOLD AT VW OF AMERICA THAT THEY COULD ONLY ASSIST ME WITH MY ISSUE IF MY VIN NUMBER MATCHED THE RECALLS.  SO MY QUESTION, WHAT IF THE STALL OF MY VEHICLE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT AND SERIOUS INJURIES OR FATALITIES WERE INVOLVED, WOULD VW LOOK INTO THE 2002 RECALL THEN OR JUST TELL THE FAMILIES, SORRY, YOU DIDN'T HAVE A 2003. *TR",

WHEN I TRIED TO STOP THE CAR AT THE CORNER THE BRAKES DIDN'T WORK QUITE RIGHT BUT THE CAR DID STOP.  WENT A LITTLE FURTHER AND APPLIED THE BRAKES TO MAKE A TURN AND MY CARE STARTED SHUTTERING AND LOTS OF WHITE SMOKE CAME OUT THE BACK -ACTUALLY ALMOST ENVELOPED MY CAR SO I HAD A HARD TIME MAKING THE TURN DUE TO POOR VISIBILITY AND THE CARS VIBRATIONS.

I HAD THE SAME THICK WHITE SMOKE AND THE CAR WAS SHAKING VIOLENTLY WHENEVER I PRESSED DOWN ON THE BRAKES.  AGAIN HAD CAR TOWED TO SHOP.  THEY ARE NOW FIXING AS PART OF THE WARRANTY TO THE BRAKE BOOSTER ISSUE AS THEY FOUND NEW LEAVES CLOGGING THE BRAKE BOOSTER LINES AND FOUND TOTAL FAILURE OF THAT PART.  THE VW SERVICE REP SAID SEVERAL GALLONS OF WATER CAME OUT OF MY ENGINE WHEN THEY REMOVED THE DEBRIS.

THE CAR IS REGULARLY MAINTAINED AT VW RECOMMENDED INTERVALS BY FOREIGN CAR MOTORS INC. AND HAS ALSO BEEN SERVICED BY RIVERBANK VW IN STAMFORD, CT.  ALL VW SERVICE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED BY VW DEALERSHIPS (EXCEPT THE MOST RECENT CAMPAIGN R5 26E5 WHICH IS STILL OUTSTANDING).  THE CAR IS ACCIDENT FREE AND NO AFTER MARKET PARTS ARE INSTALLED. THE OVERALL CONDITION OF THE CAR IS 9 OUT OF 10 FOR A CAR ITS AGE. RIVERBANK VW IN STAMFORD PERFORMED THE P9 SERVICE ACTION ON 10/10/2007AT 40957 MILES.    BRAKE BOOSTER FAILURE IN COLD WEATHER  IN DECEMBER 2008 (AT APPROXIMATELY 51000 MILES) OWNER EXPERIENCED REPEATED BRAKE PROBLEMS IN COLD WEATHER, WHICH WERE EVENTUALLY DIAGNOSED AS A BRAKE BOOSTER FAILURE. UPON INSPECTION, EXTENSIVE WATER AND RUST WAS FOUND IN THE BOOSTER AS WELL AS THE CONNECTING VACUUM LINES AND ONE-WAY VALVES REQUIRING THE REPLACEMENT OF THE BOOSTER AND OTHER PARTS. FOREIGN CAR MOTORS REPLACED THE BOOSTER WITH A NEW ORIGINAL VW PART 8E0612107E. DURING REPLACEMENT FOREIGN CAR MOTORS ALSO FOUND THAT THE DRAIN BELOW THE BOOSTER WAS CLOGGED WITH HEAVY DEBRIS, INDICATING THAT THE DRAINS HAD BEEN CLOGGED FOR A LONG TIME.          ENCLOSED EXPERT OPINION BY FOREIGN CAR MOTORS STATES THAT THE ONLY REASONABLE CAUSE AND EXPLANATION FOR THE PRESENCE OF WATER AND RUST IN THE BRAKE BOOSTER IS THAT THE P9 SERVICE ACTION DID EITHER NOT REMEDY THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM OR THAT THE DAMAGE STARTED BEFORE THE P9 ACTION WAS PERFORMED AND THE DAMAGE ONLY BECAME APPARENT IN DECEMBER 2008/JANUARY 2009. IN EITHER CASE, THE REASON FOR THE BOOSTER FAILURE IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE UNDERLYING CAUSE THAT TRIGGERED THE P9 SERVICE ACTION.    BASED ON THIS ASSESSMENT I KINDLY REQUEST THE REIMBURSEMENT OF INCURRED REPAIR EXPENSES: *TR",

AS THE CAR MANUAL SAYS, I DROVE IN LOW POWER TO THE CLOSEST VOLKSWAGEN DEALERSHIP (BOSTON VOLKSWAGEN, 168 WESTERN AVENUE, ALLSTON). WHILE I WAS DRIVING TO THE DEALERSHIP, I SAW SOME SMOKE COMING OUT FROM THE FRONT HOOD (RIGHT FRONT SIDE). WE (MY DAUGHTERS, MY WIFE, AND MYSELF) GOT THE DEALERSHIP AROUND 11:30AM. A SALES CONSULTANT (MICHAEL PETERSANTE) AND ANOTHER PERSON THERE SAW MY CAR, AND SAID THAT MY CAR POSSIBLY WOULD CATCH ON FIRE. WE EVACUATED FROM THE CAR, THEY MOVED ALL THE CARS AROUND MY CAR TO THE OTHER PLACE. THE DEALER CALLED FOR A FIRE DEPARTMENT. BEFORE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CAME IN, WHILE I WAS LOOKING AT MY CAR FROM THE INSIDE OF THE DEALERSHIP BUILDING, I COULD SEE THE FLAME COMING OUT ABOVE THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL IN THE CAR (SOMEWHERE THE ENGINE IS LOCATED) AND SMOKE FILLING UP INSIDE OF MY CAR. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT (BOSTON FIRE-ENGINE 41, LADDER 14, UNIT D11) CAME AND PUT OUT THE FIRE. A POLICE OFFICER  (BOSTON POLICE DISTRICT 14, 301 WASHINGTON STREET, BRIGHTON) CAME AFTER THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED (ARRIVED AT 11:53AM), AND CHECKED OUT THE SCENE AND HAD MY CAR, WHOSE FRONT PART (ENGINE COMPARTMENT) WAS ALL BROKEN AND CRUSHED WHILE THE WIRE WAS PUT OUT, BE TOWED. IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT A 5-6 YEARS OLD CAR CAUGHT ON FIRE WHILE I WAS DRIVING AND IN JUST 30 MINUTES REACHED TO SUCH SITUATION. FORTUNATELY, WE WERE CLOSE TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WERE ABLE TO GET THERE BEFORE THE WORST THING HAPPENS. AND AGAIN, VERY FORTUNATELY, MY FAMILY WAS ABLE TO GET AWAY TO THE SAFE PLACE BEFORE THE WORST THING HAPPENS. BUT IF IT HAPPENED 10 MINUTES EARLIER OR IF IT TOOK 10 MINUTES LONGER THAN ACTUALLY IT DID TO GET THERE, THINGS THAT I DON'T EVER WANT TO IMAGINE COULD HAPPEN TO MY FAMILY.  *TR",

THE VOLKSWAGEN REPRESENTATIVE WITH WHOM I SPOKE ON THE PHONE INSTRUCTED ME TO BRING MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP. WHEN I FINALLY BROUGHT THE CAR IN, SERVICE MANAGER JOE INFORMED ME THAT WHAT I EXPERIENCED WAS LIKELY ENGINE TROUBLE REQUIRING OF MULTIPLE PART REPLACEMENT AND CALLED OIL SLUDGE. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD COST $2,800 FOR REPAIRS BECAUSE THE WARRANTY ON MY FIVE-YEAR-OLD/56,000-MILE CAR RAN OUT. I CALLED CUSTOMER CARE AT 1-800-822-8987 AND SPOKE WITH REPRESENTATIVE NAMED FRODET AND HER SUPERVISOR, JAMES CUSTER, BOTH OF WHOM TOLD ME THAT THIS PROBLEM IS NOT UNHEARD OF AND HAS EVEN BEEN TERMED OIL SLUDGE AND IS COVERED UNDER VW'S SPECIAL EXTENDED WARRANTY  8 YEARS/UNLIMITED MILES. FRODET OPENED CASE NO. 70295194 IN MY NAME AND CALLED SERVICE MANAGER. I RECEIVED A CALL NEXT DAY. I WAS TOLD THAT IN ORDER TO FIX THIS PROBLEM UNDER VW?S SPECIAL EXTENDED WARRANTY, I NEEDED TO PROVIDE ALL ELEVEN RECEIPTS FOR OIL CHANGES THAT TOOK PLACE WITHIN THE ENTIRE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD OF OWNERSHIP. AFTER SCOURING MY FILES, I FOUND THAT I HAVE A TOTAL OF 20 RECEIPTS PERTAINING TO SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE OF THE VEHICLE, SEVENTEEN OF WHICH WERE NOT FROM THE CREST MONT DEALERSHIP. I FAXED THESE SEVENTEEN RECEIPTS TO THE ATTENTION OF SERVICE MANAGER JOE. THE VERY NEXT DAY SEPTEMBER 18TH, JOE CALLED ME AGAIN TO LET ME KNOW ME THAT A FIELD FACTORY REPRESENTATIVE REVIEWED THESE RECEIPTS AND REFUSED TO ADMIT SIXTEEN OF THEM. THESE RECEIPTS WERE FROM MY PERSONAL MECHANIC TO WHOM I HAD ENTRUSTED THE CARE AND SERVICE OF EVERY CAR I HAD. BUT, BECAUSE MY MECHANIC FAILED TO SPECIFY MY CAR'S VIN, LICENSE PLATE NUMBER, AND OIL FILTER PART NUMBERS IN THE RECEIPTS, I WAS OUT OF LUCK.  *TR",

I FELT THAT THIS WAS NOT A FARE DETERMINATION OF THIS CASE SO I APPEALED TWICE TO VW (CASE # 60127133).  THEY STATED TWICE THAT THEY HAD TO STAND BY THE DETERMINATION OF THE REP ON HAND THAT DAY AND WOULD NOT FIX THE ISSUE (COST = OVER $800).  I HAVE BEEN ADVISED BY CONSUMERS UNION TO CONTACT YOU AS THEY STATED THAT ANY PLAY IN THE SEAT TRACK IS IN FACT A SAFETY ISSUE... *JB  *NM",

THE SMELL WOULD BE WORSE SOME DAYS.  A FRIEND FOUND MY TANK LEAKING .  I TOOK MY CAR IN THE NEXT DAY, MONDAY P.M. TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT BARON VW. THEY SAID IT WAS A NIPPLE ON A HOSE INSIDE THE TANK, AND THE WHOLE TANK HAD TO BE REPLACED.  THIS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE REPAIR, THAT THEY ARE ESTIMATING TO BE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS.    I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS JUST HAPPENED, WITH THE HOSE BEING INSIDE THE TANK, I THINK THIS IS A BAD PART.  I HAVE FOUND OTHER INCIDENTS OF THIS ONLINE , FOR THIS PARTICULAR 2002 PASSAT, WITH FOUR MOTION.  I THINK IT IS A DEFECT OF THE PART AND IT IS EXPENSIVE BECAUSE THE WHOLE DRIVE TRAIN MUST BE REMOVED TO REPLACE IT.     I AM HOPING YOU WILL LOOK INTO THIS BECAUSE THAT IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM. I DON'T THINK SOME PEOPLE WOULD EVEN NOTICE THEIR TANKS LEAKING.  IF MY CAR WAS NOT STORED IN MY GARAGE EVERYDAY I WOULD HAVE NEVER NOTICED IT.  IT COULD HAVE BLOWN MY HOUSE UP WHEN I TURNED MY HEATER ON FOR THE WINTER WITH THE FUMES THAT WERE IN THIS HOUSE, NOT TO MENTION DRIVING WITH A LEAKING TANK, AND THE CHANCE OF STATIC OR A CIGARETTE BUTT GETTING TOSSED MY WAY.  THE CAR HAS BEEN OUT OF MY GARAGE FOR 3 DAYS NOW AND THE ATTIC FAN HAS BEEN ON UNTIL LAST NIGHT  AND MY HOUSE STILL STINKS. I  AM AFRAID NOW TO TURN MY HOME FURNACE ON.  PEOPLE WHO OWN THESE CARS SHOULD BE WARNED TO CHECK THEM FOR GAS LEAKS, ESPECIALLY IF THEY KEEP THEM IN THEIR GARAGE. I ALSO THINK ABOUT THE TIMES I HAD MY GRANDSON STRAPPED INTO A CHILD SEAT RIGHT THERE OVER THAT LEAKING TANK. THE REASON THE SMELL WAS IN MY HOUSE STRONGER SOME DAYS WAS BECAUSE I WOULD LEAVE THE CAR OUTSIDE SOMETIMES AND I HAD THE WINDOWS OPEN AND ATTIC FAN ON WOULD DRAW THE SMELL OUT.  THE DAY I DISCOVERED IT WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG WAS BECAUSE I HAD PUT THE CAR BACK IN AND SHUT THE WINDOWS AND TURNED MY A/C BACK ON IN THE HOUSE.    *JB",

DRIVER  JUMPED IN CAR TO SET THE BRAKE, BUT FELL ON STREET AS CAR ROLLED.  CAR CROSSED STREET AND HEADED DOWN A STEEPER INCLINE HITTING BUSHES, CROSSING ANOTHER DRIVEWAY, AND FINALLY HITTING A ROCK WALL COMING TO A STOP.  CHILDREN WERE OK. DRIVER HAD BRUISES / SCRATCHES FROM FALLING ON PAVEMENT. CAR SUSTAINED $3,400 IN DAMAGE. NEIGHBORS VERIFIED CAR WAS IN PARK, AND OWNER MANUAL STATES THAT KEYS CANNOT BE REMOVED WITHOUT THE CAR BEING IN PARK ( KEYS WERE OBSERVED BY SEVERAL NEIGHBORS TO BE OUT OF THE CAR).  VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA ASKED ME TO GO TO A DEALER FOR PROBLEM DETERMINATION.  DEALER TRIED PARKING THE CAR 5 TIMES ON UPHILL AND DOWNHILL INCLINES, AND PARK HELD.  THEY ALSO CHECKED THE COMPUTER AND FOUND NO FAULTS.  NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CHECK THE INTERNALS OF THE TRANSMISSION, TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INCLINE WAS THE SAME AS THE DRIVEWAY WHERE IT OCCURRED, OR TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE WAS A REASON FOR AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM.  VW OF AMERICA STATED THAT THE DEALER HAD FOUND THE CAR WAS IN SPEC (WITH THE 5 HILL TESTS AND COMPUTER CHECK), AND NO FURTHER ACTION WOULD BE TAKEN. VW STATED THAT WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN USING THE PARKING BRAKE ANY TIME WE PARK (WE DO ON STEEPER HILLS, BUT NOT ON HILLS AS SLIGHT AS OUR DRIVEWAY).   NOBODY HAS EXPLAINED WHY PARK FAILED EVEN THOUGH THE KEYS WERE OUT OF THE IGNITION (AND OBSERVED TO BE BY OTHERS) -- I CONCEDE THE PARKING BRAKE SHOULD ALWAYS BE USED OUT OF EXTREME CAUTION, BUT MOST PEOPLE DO NOT ON SLIGHT HILLS -- PARK SHOULD NOT FAIL IN ANY CASE.  WE FEEL WE HAVE TO GET RID OF THE CAR ASAP BECAUSE THIS HAS NOT BEEN EXPLAINED / ADDRESSED.  OTHER CARS (LIKE 2006 BMW) HAVE RECALLS ON THE PARKING PAWL, BUT VW WILL NOT INVESTIGATE FURTHER.  *NM",

TOOK IT TO THE DEALER, WHO FIRST POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS TIME FOR ME TO PAY THE PASSAT DRIVER PRIVILEGE TAX, A.K.A., $650 FOR STANDARD MAINTENANCE WORK.  REGARDING THE GAS SMELL, AFTER THE MECHANICS ALLEGEDLY CHECKED THE CAR, THE SERVICE ADVISOR SPECULATED THAT IT WAS A LEAK IN ONE OF THE FUEL PUMP SEALS, WHICH ARE LOCATED UNDER THE BACK SEAT (WHERE THE STRONGEST SMELL WAS COMING FROM).  HE SAID THAT HE HAD SEEN OTHER PASSATS AT AROUND MY SAME MILEAGE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE TANK WAS ONLY  FULL THOUGH, AND THE SMELL WAS NOT PRESENT, SO HE ASKED ME TO BRING THE CAR BACK ON ANOTHER DAY, WITH A FULL GAS TANK, SO THAT THE MECHANICS COULD SMELL IT.  WHEN I SUGGESTED THAT IT MIGHT BE MORE DIFFICULT (AND DANGEROUS) TO EXAMINE A FULL GAS TANK, HE AGREED AND WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK A WEEK LATER FOR THE MECHANICS CHECK IT OUT, THAT'S WHEN THE SERVICE ADVISOR TOLD ME THAT THE GAS TANK WAS 'CRACKED' (NEAR THE TOP) ' AND THAT IT WOULD COST $2,000+ TO FIX IT.  THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT CAUSED BY 'WEAR AND TEAR'- NOR IS IT A PROBLEM THAT I COULD HAVE CAUSED ABSENT SOME SORT OF IMPACT.    I CALLED VW AMERICA TO ASK THEM TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR, AND AFTER THEY INVESTIGATED MY CLAIM, THEY TOLD ME THAT THE DEALERSHIP OFFERED TO PAY 1/2 THE COST OF THE REPAIR, ($1,000). WHEN I NEXT SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE ADVISOR AT THE DEALERSHIP, HE TOLD ME THAT VW HAD OFFERED TO PAY 1/2 THE COST OF THE REPAIR, OR WOULD GIVE ME A $1,000 CREDIT TOWARD A NEW CAR.  MY INVESTIGATIONS HAVE LED ME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS IS EITHER A DEFECT OF THE VW FUEL TANKS OR THE CRACK IS DUE TO CORROSION, WHICH SHOULD BE 100% COVERED UNDER THE 12 YEAR CORROSION WARRANTY.

I HAD MY CAR WASHED THE WEEK BEFORE JUNE 27TH, MY CAR IS GARAGE KEPT DAY AND NIGHT.  WE HAD BAD RAIN STORMS IN THE WASHINGTON DC AREA WHICH I DID NOT DRIVE IN THE FIRST DAY... THE SECOND DAY I DID GET CAUGHT IN A RAIN STORM BUT IT WAS NOT UNUSUALLY HARD AND I DID NOT GO THROUGH AND LARGE PUDDLES.  WHEN I GOT HOME I NOTICED A TON OF WATER HAD COLLECTED ON THE FLOOR OF THE DRIVERS SIDE OF THE CAR.  THE LIGHTS BEGAN TO FLICKER AND GO ON AND OFF... THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM WAS NOT WORKING... SO I CALLED THE DEALER WHO INFORMED ME THIS WAS THE CASE WITH A LOT OF THEIR CUSTOMERS AND COULD BE A BACKED UP DRAIN FROM THE SUNROOF.  HE SAID TO HAVE TO CAR TOWED IN ... WHICH I DID.  I THEN HEARD FROM THE DEALER TWO DAYS LATER WHO SAID THERE WERE SOME LEAVES IN THE WINDSHIELD WIPER CATCH AND THAT WAS WHAT CAUSED THE WATER TO POOL INTO THE CAR... IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY ESSENTIALLY MY FAULT AND THE REPAIR CONSISTED OF GUTTING THE INTERIOR REPLACEMENT OF CARPET AND ELECTRICAL BOXES UNDER DRIVERS SIDE ETC.  THAT IS WOULD BE EXPENSIVE.. PARTS ALONE ESTIMATED OVER 1K.  I WAS SHAKEN... HE SAID HE HAD TO BREAK THE NEWS TO A LOT OF CUSTOMERS... I HAVE CHECKED MESSAGE BOARDS AND THIS SEEMS TO BE A VERY COMMON AND COSTLY PROBLEM FOR A LOT OF PASSAT VW OWNERS.  THIS SEEMS THAT IF SO MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING A PROBLEM THERE MUST BE A DESIGN FLAW.  I AM STILL TRYING TO APPEAL THE FACT I HAVE TO PAY WITH THE DEALER.. HAVE NOT YET HEARD FROM THEM IN 3 DAYS.    VW NEEDS TO PAY OR RECALL AND FIX THESE PROBLEMS.  THANK YOUR FOR YOUR HELP.  *JB",

BELTS WERE CHANGED, INCLUDING THE TIMING BELT, THE WATER PUMP WAS CHANGED, AND VARIOUS OTHER REPAIRS NOT PROPERLY EXPLAINED TO ME. THIS TIME IT COST ME AN ADDITIONAL $1,087.00. SO FAR IN LESS THAN A WEEK I HAD SPENT $1,600.00. THURSDAY MORNING I DROVE TO WORK AND I CALLED THE DEALER TO REPORT THAT I STILL FELT A \"TWITCH\" IN THE ENGINE. HE SAID THAT WAS \"STRANGE\" AND ASKED ME TO BRING IT IN. ON THURSDAY I WAS DRIVING TO A LUNCH MEETING WITH A COLLEAGUE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A LOUD RATTLING NOISE WAS HEARD COMING FROM THE ENGINE. I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER AND DISCOVERED ENGINE OIL ALL OVER THE GROUND. I CALLED THE DEALER WHO WAS \"SHOCKED\" AND HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALER.

THIS IS LESS THAN ONE WEEK AFTER I ORIGINALLY TOOK THE CAR IN AND THEY WORKED ON IT. NOW I HAVE TO SPEND UPWARDS OF $4,000.00 TO FIX THIS AND NO ONE, NOT THE DEALER AND CERTAINLY NOW VW, IS WILLING TO HELP ME WITH THIS.

WITHIN THE PAST 2 MONTHS AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM STARTED WITH VERY STRONG GASOLINE FUMES COMING FROM THE CAR AFTER THE TANK IS FILLED AND THE CAR IS PARKED IN A RESIDENTIAL GARAGE.  THE GAS TANK IS FILLED UNTIL THE FIRST CLICK OFF OF THE GAS NOZZLE ( AT SEVERAL DIFFERENT GAS STATIONS).  THE GASOLINE FUMES ARE VERY STRONG, REQUIRING THAT THE GARAGE DOORS BE LEFT  PARTIALLY OPEN TO REDUCE THE FUMES TO A TOLERABLE LEVEL.  NO FUEL DRIPS FROM THE VEHICLE.  THE FUMES SEEM TO BE COMING FROM THE RIGHT REAR OF THE CAR.  FUMES CAN SOMETIMES BE SMELLED BRIEFLY OUTDOORS WHEN THE VEHICLE'S GAS TANK IS FULL.  THE FUMES STOP AFTER THE TANK LEVEL IS DOWN TO ABOUT 3/4  TANK. THE PROBLEM RECURS CONSISTENTLY NOW FOR ME EVERYTIME THE VEHICLE IS REFUELED.    I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL VW DEALER ON 11/5/05.  THEY PRESSURED TESTED THE VEHICLE'S FUEL SYSTEM WITH ARGON AND REPORTED THAT THEY CAN FIND NO FUEL LEAK OR DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM WITH A FULL TANK OF GAS. THE SERVICE MANAGER CONTACTED VW TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.  I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN ON 12/15/05 WITH A HALF TANK OF FUEL AS REQUESTED.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIANS, AS RECOMMENDED BY VW TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, REMOVED THE GAS TANK AND WEIGHED THE CHARCOAL CANISTER TO DETERMINE IF ADEQUATE CHARCOAL WAS PRESENT.  THE CHARCOAL CANISTER WAS WITHIN FACTORY SPECIFICATIONS.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIANS REINSTALLED THE SAME PARTS AND THEN FILLED THE GAS TANK.  THEY THEN PRESSURE TESTED THE VEHICLE'S FUEL SYSTEM WITH ARGON OVERNIGHT, LEAVING THE VEHICLE IN THE SERVICE BAY.  THEY COULD NOT DETECT ANY FUEL LEAKS OR REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM.   VW TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE REPORTEDLY TOLD THE TECH'S THAT THEY HAD DONE ALL THAT WAS POSSIBLE AND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO DO.  THE SERVICE MANAGER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEIR SERVICE BAY IS QUITE LARGE AND VENTILATED SO THAT THE CONDITIONS DO NOT DUPLICATE HAVING THE VEHICLE IN A RESIDENTIAL  GARAGE.  A FIRE RISK AND FUME EXPOSURE REMAIN.  *JB",

SO I HAD MY CAR TOWED TO THE DEALER AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT IT IS ONLY UNDER WARRANTY IF I CAN SUPPLY THEM WITH EVERY RECEIPT FROM OWNING THE CAR. I HAVE MISPLACED TWO SO NOW THEY WILL NOT COVER THIS AND IS COSTING ME AROUND $950.00 TO GET THIS FIXED.  I HAVE ALWAYS CHANGED MY OIL ON TIME.  THIS SEEMS TO BE THERE WAY OF SCREWING THERE SO CALLED VALUED CUSTOMERS.  I WAS ON A WEB SITE (MYVWLEMON.COM) AND FOUND NUMEROUS OF PASSAT OWNERS WITH THIS EXACT PROBLEM AND OUT COME.  WHY IS THE CONSUMER RESPONSIBLE FOR A POORLY DESIGNED ENGINE? THE HEAT OF THE 1.8L TURBO IS BREAKING THE OIL DOWN CREATING SLUDGE.  THEY OBVIOUSLY KNOW OF THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY ISSUED A WARRANTY EXTENSION. HOWEVER, VW OF AMERICA WILL ONLY COVER THE WARRANTY IF THE OWNER CAN PROVIDE EVERY SINGLE RECEIPT, SOMETHING THEY KNOW THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE CAN DO ESPECIALLY IF SOME CHANGE THEIR OWN OIL. THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT I HAVE DEALT WITH SINCE I BOUGHT BY PASSAT BRAND NEW. CHECKING THE WEBSITE ALSO TELLS ME THIS MAY NOT BE THE LAST OF MY PROBLEMS.  *JB",

I WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE HOME FROM WORK WHEN THE OIL PRESSURE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON, FOLLOWED BY THE WORD STOP ON THE DASHBOARD. I PULLED THE VEHICLE OVER AND HAD IT TOWED TO THE CLOSEST V.W. DEALER. THE DEALER DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS AN OIL SLUDGE PROBLEM AND ADVISED ME IT WOULD COST $900 TO FIX THE PROBLEM UNLESS I COULD SHOW PROOF OF OIL CHANGES THROUGH RECEIPTS. I SUPPLIED THE DEALER WITH 6 OIL CHANGE RECEIPTS FROM A SMALL GARAGE NEAR MY HOUSE WHERE I GET THE OIL CHANGED. I CALLED THE DEALER BACK A FEW DAYS LATER AND ASKED THE STATUS OF MY CAR. THE G.M. OF THE SHOP ACCUSED ME OF FORGERY DUE TO THE FACT THE RECEIPTS DID NOT HAVE TAX OR METHOD OF PAYMENT AT THE BOTTOM. I REPLIED THAT THE SHOP CHARGES ME $30.00 TO CHANGE THE OIL, I GIVE THEM $30.00, AND I LEAVE. HE THEN STATED IF I PAID CASH FOR THE OIL CHANGES, I GUESS I COULDN'T GIVE THEM WHAT THEY WANTED(PROOF OF PAYMENT I.E. CHECK STUB, CREDIT CARD STATEMENT'S). HE ESTIMATED THE REPAIR AT $900 AND THAT THE WARRENTY WOULD NOT COVER ANY OF IT. SO BECAUSE I PAY CASH FOR MY OIL CHANGES I AM BEING DENIED REPAIR UNDER WARRENTY. THE REPAIR CONSISTS OF CLEARING OUT THE OIL PUMP PICK UP SCREEN OF THE SLUDGE AND REPLACING A COUPLE OF VENT TUBES THAT MAY BE CLOGGED. THE CAR IS PRESENTLY SITTING AT THE DEALER IN NEED OF REPAIR.

ON THE SECOND OCASION I WAS BEING TAILGATED BY A TRACTOR TRAILER WHICH ALMOST OVERRUN ME AFTER THE SUDDEN LOSS OF SPEED.
