In addition, I only recently noticed it would not lock, but I have no idea when it started failing, so having an unlocked door when you THINK it's locked is also dangerous.  Yes, the problem has been reproduced.  Yes, the vehicle has been inspected by a dealership.  No, there were no warning lamps, messages, or other symptoms, and I do not know when it may have started.
