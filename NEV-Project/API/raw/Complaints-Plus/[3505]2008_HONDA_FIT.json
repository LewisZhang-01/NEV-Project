ON 3/8/21 I IMMEDIATELY CALLED MY HONDA DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THAT I WOULD NEED TO BRING THE VEHICLE IN FOR THEM TO LOOK AT IT. I ASKED THEM TO TOW IT, AS I DID NOT WANT TO DRIVE IT, AND POSSIBLY DAMAGE IT MORE. THEY AGREED TO HAVE IT TOWED TO THEIR DEALERSHIP ON 3/8/21. AFTER THEY LOOKED AT IT THAT SAME DAY, THEY TOLD ME THAT NOTHING WAS WRONG AND THAT THE CAR DID NOT HAVE ANY ISSUES. I TOLD THEM TO DRIVE IT AGAIN AND TRY TO USE THE SPORT MODE AS WELL BECAUSE IT WAS NOT WORKING ON 3/7/21. ON 3/9/21, THEY SAID THAT WHEN THEY DROVE THE CAR, IT DID NOT SKIP GEARS AND THE SPORT MODE WAS WORKING. I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NOW DAMAGE TO THE TRANSMISSION AND THE SERVICE TECH IS JUST TRYING TO COVER UP HIS MISTAKE AND MAKE ME PAY FOR THE TOW BILL. PLEASE SEE ATTACHED PAPER WORK FROM THE DEALERSHIP AND NOTE THAT THEY DID NOT EVEN CHECK MY TRANSMISSION FLUID TO WHEN THEY INITIALLY DID THE WORK TO REPLACE THE AXLES.

FAST FORWARD TO ALMOST 3 MONTHS LATER--STILL NO WORD ON WHERE OUR REPLACEMENT IS, AND I'M STILL RIDING IN THE BACKSEAT. WE'VE TRIED CALLING HONDA MULTIPLE TIMES--THEY FILL OUT A CUSTOMER SERVICE TICKET AND WE NEVER HEAR BACK. SO BASICALLY WE ARE UNABLE TO USE THE CAR IN THE MANNER WE INTENDED TO WHEN WE PURCHASED IT, AND THERE'S NO END IN SIGHT. I HAVE NEVER BEEN GIVEN THE RUN-AROUND LIKE THIS, AND I CANNOT FATHOM WHY WE HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN CALLED BACK. I FEEL TRICKED AND ANGRY. PLEASE HELP.",

PROVIDED VIN NUMBER TO [XXX] FROM SERVICE DEPARTMENT FOUR TIMES, WHO REPEATEDLY TOLD ME SHE CANNOT FIND MY VIN IN THEIR SYSTEM AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOTHING SHE CAN DO ABOUT THE RECALL. I OFFERED TO PROVIDE OTHER INFORMATION SUCH AS MAKE/YEAR/MODEL TO HELP LOCATE MY VEHICLE, BUT [XXX] REFUSED TO TAKE ANY INFORMATION AND INSISTED THERE IS NOTHING THEIR DEALERSHIP CAN DO ABOUT THE RECALLS. I ASKED HER FOR RECOMMENDATIONS IN TERMS OF HOW TO GET THESE POTENTIAL FATAL DEFECTS REPLACED, SHE PROVIDED THE SAME ANSWER ?THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO?.     HEARD SIMILAR STORIES FROM OTHER HONDA OWNERS ABOUT THE WALNUT CREEK HONDA DEALERSHIP. SEEMS LIKE WALNUT CREEK HONDA IS SYSTEMATICALLY DENYING RECALL SERVICES IN AN ATTEMPT TO DRIVE CAR OWNERS AWAY SO THEY WILL TAKE THEIR PROBLEMS ELSEWHERE.     I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE HONDA RECALL CENTER HEADQUARTER, WHO REACHED OUT TO WALNUT CREEK HONDA AND MADE THEM AGREE TO PERFORM THE REQUIRED RECALL WORK ON MY VEHICLE. BUT NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH SO MANY HOOPS TO GET SAFETY RECALLS TAKEN CARE OF IN AMERICA IN THE FIRST PLACE. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW HELPLESS OTHER PEOPLE MUST FEEL WHEN THEY WERE DENIED SUCH IMPORTANT RECALL SERVICE, ESPECIALLY IF THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF AN AVENUE TO ESCALATE MATTERS WITH THE HONDA RECALL CENTER OR WITH THE NHTSA. MY COMPLAINT IS WITH WALNUT CREEK HONDA, NOT HONDA ON THE CORPORATE LEVEL.     I HEREBY ASK THE NHTSA TO LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE MISCONDUCT AND LIKELY ILLEGAL ACTION BY WALNUT CREEK HONDA IN DENYING CAR OWNERS OF THEIR RIGHTS TO SAFETY RECALL SERVICES.    THANK YOU.

I LEFT THE PARKING LOT AND DROVE A FEW MILES WHEN I HEARD A STRANGE ZINGING SOUND AND FELT A WIGGLING FEELING IN THE SEAT OF MY PANTS. I CHANGED LANES TO MAKE SURE IT WAS  NOT THE PAVEMENT, IT WAS NOT. I PULLED OVER TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD AND JUST AS I SLOWED DOWN I SAW THE YELLOW TPMS LIGHT COME ON. I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND CHECKED MY TIRES. THE FIRST TIRE I CHECKED WAS THE LEFT REAR AND I FOUND IT WAS COMPLETELY FLAT. I GOT THE SPARE OUT ON MOUNTED IT. I CHECK THE AIR PRESSURE IN THE SPARE AND IT WAS 60 PSI. AS I PUT THE FLAT TIRE INTO THE BACK OF THE CAR I SAW A 4 INCH HOLE IN THE TREAD OF THE TIRE, WITH A PIECE OF TERRA COTTA COLORED CHUNK OF CERAMIC STICKING OUT OF THE TREAD. I GOT HOME AND I DISMOUNTED THE TIRE FROM THE WHEEL AND MOUNTED A NEW TIRE ON THE WHEEL AND INSTALLED THE WHEEL ON THE CAR. THE NEXT TIME I HAD THE YELLOW TPMS LIGHT COME ON WAS A YEAR OR SO LATER.

THE NEXT STEP WOULD INVOLVE US PAYING FOR A DIAGNOSTIC TEST. ACCORDING TO SEARCHES ON THE INTERNET, THERE WAS A BATTERY PROBLEM ESPECIALLY IN 2009. HOPEFULLY, THIS BATTERY WILL BE A GOOD ONE. I GUESS WE SHOULD BE HAPPY WE DON'T HAVE THE ACCELERATION PROBLEM DOCUMENTED ON THIS WEBSITE.  SO FAR, THE DEALER HAS BEEN GREAT ABOUT REPLACING THE BATTERIES FOR FREE UNDER THE BATTERY WARRANTY.

THERE ARE NO \"SERVICE INDICATOR LIGHTS ON\". THIS STALL IN THE ENGINE OCCURS REGARDLESS IF VEHICLE IS COLD OR WARMED UP. HONDA DEALERSHIP SUGGESTED REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION FLUID. COST $210.00.

THIS CREATES A HAZARD FOR VEHICLES BOTH IN FRONT AND IN BACK OF ME. THERE IS VERY LITTLE CONTROL IN THE BRAKING SYSTEM. FROM THE FORUMS, IT APPEARS THERE ARE MANY OTHER HONDA FIT OWNERS WITH THE SIMILAR PROBLEM. SOME HAVE GOTTEN INTO ACCIDENTS DUE TO THIS FAILURE, WHILE OTHERS HAVE BEEN MORE LUCKY. THIS IS CERTAINLY A ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.    I HAVE TAKEN MY CAR TO THE HONDA DEALERSHIP, WHOM HAVE DENIED ANYTHING BEING WRONG. I URGE YOU TO INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER BEFORE ANOTHER PERSON IS KILLED/ INJURED DUE TO THIS FAILURE.",

EVEN LIGHT PRESSURE ON THE  BRAKE PEDAL WHILE GOING OVER SOME POT HOLES AND UP ONTO DRIVE WAYS TRIGGERS THE ABS SYSTEM.     I NEVER PAID MUCH ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I ALWAYS LEAVE ENOUGH SPACE BETWEEN MYSELF AND OTHER VEHICLES, BUT AFTER DOING SOME ONLINE RESEARCH AFTER MY ACCIDENT, IT HAS BECOME APPARENT TO ME THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE ABS PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE. NOR AM I THE ONLY INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS REPORTED THIS ISSUE TO THE NHTSA. AS A NOTE, I HAVE DRIVEN VARIOUS SMALL AND LARGE VEHICLES - WITH AND WITHOUT ABS - AND THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN REACTED SO POORLY IN AN EMERGENCY/PANIC SITUATION.

THE SITUATION IS ALSO DANGEROUS AT DUSK WHEN THE LIGHTED PANEL AGAIN GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT THE HEADLIGHTS ARE ON.

STRONG SURGE, WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO PROPEL VEHICLE RAPIDLY.  HAVE SINCE GONE ABOUT 20 MILES WITH NO RECURRENCE.       NOTIFIED  PENSACOLA HONDA, FLORIDA SERVICE DEPARTMENT, THIS DATE AT APPROXIMATELY 1300, SHE WASN?T AWARE OF ANY RECALL AND WAS UNABLE TO LOG THIS EVENT AS HISTORY ON MY RECORD.  ASKED ME TO BRING IT IN.  FOUND THE FOLLOWING ON LINE:     REPLYING TO: SHELLEY04 (APR 23, 2009 10:19 AM)  I FOUND YOUR POST BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING FOR OTHERS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM AS I'M HAVING. I HAVE A 2008 FIT. I HAVEN'T CRASHED (YET) BUT IT'S CERTAINLY VERY DISCONCERTING. IT USUALLY OCCURS AT VERY LOW SPEED, WHEN I STEP ON THE BRAKE THE ENGINE SURGES, BUT ONLY OCCASIONALLY. THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED I THOUGHT MAYBE I'D ACCIDENTALLY STEPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR, BUT SINCE I'VE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE, I THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT WEIRD THAT I'D DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IT'S HAPPENED 3 MORE TIMES SINCE THEN, AND EACH TIME I'VE VERIFIED THAT MY FOOT IS ON THE BRAKE PEDDLE. I HAVE TO REALLY MASH DOWN ON THE BRAKE TO STOP THE CAR. IT HAS HAPPENED BOTH WHEN GOING STRAIGHT AND WHEN TURNING, SO I DON'T THINK THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT, AND ROAD CONDITIONS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DRY.      I WILL BE TAKING IT TO MY HONDA DEALER NEXT WEEK, BUT SINCE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS EVERY TIME, I EXPECT THAT IT WILL NOT OCCUR DURING THE TEST DRIVE. I HOPE HONDA AMERICA WILL TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AND CORRECT THE PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT, AS COULD VERY EASILY HAPPEN IF IT OCCURS WHEN THERE'S A PEDESTRIAN OR BICYCLIST NEAR THE FRONT OF THE CAR. *TR",

THE TEN-MINUTE TEST DRIVE DID NOT ALERT ME TO THE INSUFFICIENT LEGROOM THAT MAKES ME APPLY BOTH THE BRAKE AND THE GAS AT THE SAME TIME.  THE EXPLANATION FOLLOWS.    LONG DRIVES OF OVER TWENTY MINUTES CAUSE MY LEG TO CRAMP AND I NEED TO SHIFT MY RIGHT HEEL TO THE RIGHT.  THAT PUTS MY HEEL DIRECTLY BEHIND THE GAS PEDAL INSTEAD OF THE NORMAL POSITION DIRECTLY BEHIND THE BRAKE PEDAL.  WHEN THE TOE OF THE FOOT MOVES TO THE BRAKE PEDAL, THE SOLE OF THE FOOT ALSO COVERS THE EDGE OF THE GAS PEDAL AND BOTH PEDALS ARE PUSHED AT THE SAME TIME.  THE BRAKE SYSTEM IS ALSO PARTLY AT FAULT SINCE AFTER THE INITIAL APPLICATION THE BRAKE CONTINUES TO SLOWLY SINK TO THE FLOOR INSTEAD OF HOLDING THE PEDAL HEIGHT.  THIS RESULTS IN EVEN MORE GAS BEING APPLIED. HONDA HAS INSPECTED THE BRAKES AND HAS INDICATED THEY ARE WORKING NORMALLY.    I HAVE DRIVEN STANDARD SHIFT CARS MANY YEARS INCLUDING, CHEVY, PLYMOUTH, PONTIAC, TWO TOYOTAS, TWO VWS, THE 1991 HONDA, AND NOW THIS FIT.  THERE ARE MANY HUNDRED-THOUSAND MILES LOGGED IN THESE CARS.  I REPLACED MY 1991 HONDA DX WITH THE FIT.  THE CARS ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME SIZE LENGTH AND WIDTH AND THE 1991 HONDA WAS A COMFORTABLE CAR.  YOU WOULD THINK THE FIT WOULD BE AS WELL PROPORTIONED.    I HAVE CHECKED OTHER CARS OF THE SAME SIZE AND STYLE WITH THE THOUGHT OF TRADING.  I HAVE FOUND THE NISSAN VERSA, TOYOTA SCION XD, AND TOYOTA YARIS TO HAVE THE SAME OR WORSE LEGROOM AS THE FIT.  I AM 70 INCHES TALL WITH A PANT INSEAM OF 31 INCHES.  MY GUESS IS THAT ANYONE WITH AN INSEAM OF MORE THAN 29 WOULD HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.      RECALL THE HONDA FIT TO FORCE THE COMPANY TO ADJUST THE SEAT SO THAT IT WILL MOVE FARTHER BACK FROM THE GAS PEDAL AND/OR HIGHER.  THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM IN THE CAR FOR THAT TO HAPPEN.
