HE WENT TO THE BACK OF THE TRUCK AND RELEASED THE LOWER HANDLE SO THAT HE COULD HAVE MORE ROOM TO MANEUVER WITHOUT THE TRAILER HITTING THE BACK OF THE TRUCK.

HE PULLED OUT ONTO THE STREET ABOUT 30 YARDS AND THE FIFTH WHEEL CAME OUT OF THE HITCH AND CRUSHED THE  VEHICLE. THE CONTACT FELT  THIS OCCURRED BECAUSE THE SAFETY LATCH WAS NOT IN SECURELY.
