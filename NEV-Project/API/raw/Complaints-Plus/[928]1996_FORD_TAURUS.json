THE FIRST TIME THE HEATER CORE HAD BEEN REPLACED IT WAS DONE BY OUR LOCAL FORD DEALER AND WAS REPAIRED WITH A FORD PART.

AFTER THIS LAST TIME IT WAS SUGGESTED BY THE DEALER THAT THEY WILL NO LONGER REPLACE IT, NOR WILL FORD.

I DID NOT CHECK IT THIS TIME AND WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT THEY MEASURED .7 VOLTS!? I PERSONALLY DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ELECTROLYSIS IS OR HAS EVER BEEN THE PROBLEM.

THEY CHARGED ME 100.00 TO DIAGNOS THE PROBLEM. THEY SAID I NEEDED A NEW ENGINE AND THE COST WAS GOING TO BE $12,000.00. SINCE I WAS IN SHOCK WITH THE PRICE, I LOOKED INTO THE PROBLEM MYSELF AND FOUND A WEBSITE V8SHO.COM. THEY DESCRIBED MY EXACT FAILRURE. THIS IS A COMMON FAILURE AMONG ALL 1996,97,98,AND 99 SHO'S. THE ENGINE IS BUILT BY YAMAHA FOR FORD. THE PROBLEM IS THE DESIGN OF THE CAM SHAFT. THE TIMING GEAR SPROCKET IS PRESSED ONTO THE CAM AND CAN COME LOOSE AT ANY TIME. IF YOU HEAR THE AUDIBLE CHATTER FROM THE ENGINE, YOU MUST STOP DRIVING IMMEDIATELY. IF YOU CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE GEAR WILL SLIP ON THE CAM AND THE ENGINE WILL SELF DESTRUCT BENDING VALVES AND DESTROYING THE ENGINE. IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW AN INDIVIDUAL MAINTAINS THE CAR. THIS CAN HAPPEN TO ANYONE AT ANYTIME. FORD KNOWS OF THE PROBLEM. THEY ISSUED SPECIAL SERVICE BULLITEN 15879 TO CHECK FOR THE PROBLEM. IN MY CASE THE FORD DEALER WHERE I TOOK THE SHO DIDN'T EVEN TELL ME NOT TO DRIVE THE CAR ANY FURTHER. WHEN THIS IS CAUGHT IN THE BEGINNING STAGES YOU CAN WELD THE SPROKETS TO THE CAM. AFTER TAKING MY CAR APART MYSELF, I FOUND BOTH FRONT CAMS TO HAVE A PROBLEM. ONE MOVES LEFT AND RIGHT ON THE SPROKET AND THE OTHER IS LOOSE ON THE CAM.(READY TO SPIN COMPLETELY LOOSE AND KILL THE ENGINE. THE COST OS THIS SAFETY ISSUE SHOULD NOT BE THE CONSUMER'S RESPONSIBILITY. THIS IS A LATENT DEFECT BY THE MANUFACTURER.*AK",

CAR WAS TOWED TO HOME THAT EVENING AND THEN TO DEALER THE FOLLOWING DAY.  DEALER DID DIAGNOSTIC TEST AND REPORTED NO COMPRESSION TO TWO VALVES.  NEVER OFFERED TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER, BUT RECOMMENDED NEW ENGINE, APPROXIMATE COST $10,814, DEALER WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE PROBLEM. CONTACTED FORD, WHOSE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP DID NOT KNOW OF THIS MODEL TAURUS.  AS CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, FORD OFFERED NO ASSISTANCE AND SAID THAT CAR SHOULD BE TRADED AS 85K WAS HIGH MILEAGE.  TRANSFERRED CAR TO WINNER, NEWARK DE, WHERE ENGINE WAS TAKEN APART. MECHANIC FOUND 4 BENT CYLINDERS BUT COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHY IT HAPPENED ONLY THAT IT APPEARED THAT SPROCKET TEETH HAD SNAPPED, RELEASING CHAIN AND CAUSING DAMAGE TO CAMSHAFTS.  REPAIRS TOOK APPROXIMATELY 4 MONTHS DUE TO PARTS AND LACK OF TECH'S KNOWLEDGE OF ENGINE.  CAR HAS BEEN BACK TO SERVICE 5 TIMES FOR ADDITIONAL REPAIRS, I.E. REPLACE IMRC, IAC MOTOR, GASKET SEAL.  CAR HAS VALVE TAP AND ENGINE OIL PRESSURE WARNING WHEN DRIVE FOR MORE THAN 15 MINUTES AT HIGH SPEEDS.  DEALER HAS REPORTED PROBLEM IS ABOVE THEIR HEAD.  THIS CAR IS A STREET PROTOTYPE OF NASCAR RACING CARS, WHILE I DROVE 50 RT MILES ON BACKROADS/DAY IT HAS A TOP END SPEED OF 131+, ADHERENCE TO FORD MAINTENANCE SCHEDULES AND USE OF FORD CERTIFIED TECHS ARE MANDATORY TO MAINTAIN THE CAR.  MY PROBLEM HAS NOW SURFACED ON MANY SHOS AND IS NOW A DOCUMENTABLE DEFECT. THIS ENGINE COULD HAVE CEASED ON I95 WHILE DOING 85MPH.

THREE HOURS LATER THEY TOLD ME THAT THE CAR HAD A MALFUNCTION IN THE TRANSMISSION.  HENCE, THE TRANSMISSION HAD TO BE CHANGED AND THE COST WAS $2,300 DOLLARS.  THEY NEEDED TO KNOW IMMEDIATELY!  I REFUSED BECAUSE THE COST SEEMED TO HIGH AND I WASN'T COMPLETELY SURE IF THIS WAS REALLY THE PROBLEM.  I THEN TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC DEALING WITH TRANSMISSIONS ONLY.  THEY TOLD ME THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LIGHT TROUBLE.  THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM NOT EVEN BY USING THE COMPUTER.  I DECIDED TO TAKE IT TO ANOTHER AGENCY (FRIEND OF MINE) WHO KNOWS ABOUT TRANSMISSIONS.  HE SAID THAT HE HAD FIXED MANY TAURUSES BEFORE, BUT HAD NEVER ENCOUNTERED SUCH A PROBLEM.  FINALLY, I DECIDED CALL FORD TO FIND OUT ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.  THEY SIMPLY TOLD ME TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER, WHICH I HAD ALREADY AT FIRST.  I TOOK IT BACK TO ANOTHER FORD DEALER LOCATED AT THE OPPOSITE END OF NORTHERN BLVD.  THEY TOLD ME THE SAME THING AS THE LAST FORD DEALER.  AFTER ALL THIS CONFUSION, I DECIDED TO IGNORE THE PROBLEM.  IT'S BEEN ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AND I HAVE BEEN TO FLORIDA AND BACK ALREADY TWO TIMES FROM MY HOME (NEW YORK).  I USE THE CAR ON A DAILY BASIS.  I AM VERY UPSET AND CONFUSED ABOUT ALL OF THIS.  I REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON AND I THINK I DESERVE AN EXPLANATION THE FORD COMPANY.  I SENT IN THIS INFORMATION TO YOU PEOPLE (NHTSA) TO SEE IF YOU CAN HELP ME OUT ON THIS PROBLEM.

THE CAR NEVER OVERHEATED BEFORE OR NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE COOLING SYSTEM. AT THIS POINT I TOOK THE CAR TO A LOCAL MECHANIC TO LOOK AT THE CAR. MY MECHANIC ADVISED ME THAT ALL 1995 & 1996 TAURUS'S HAVE A RECALL FOR THE ENGINE COOLING SYSTEM. I THEN PROCEEDED TO TAKE MY TAURUS TO A FORD DEALER (HALDEMAN FORD ON 11/27). HALDEMAN INDICATED THAT THE RECALL EXPIRED IN SEPT 1999 AND ADVISED ME THAT THEY COULD PROBOBLY REPAIR MY VEHICLE FOR A CHARGE OF 200-300 DOLLARS. NEXT I RECEIVED A CALLED FROM HALDEMAN STATING THAT I COULD HAVE THE ENGINE FLUSHED OUT WHICH WOULD COST ABOUT $1,000.00, AND WOULD HAVE NO GUARANTEES THAT THIS WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM. OR I COULD PURCHAS A NEW ENGINE FROM HALDEMAN FOR ABOUT $3,000.00 AND WOULD HAVE A 2 YEAR 24,000 MILE WARRENTY ON THE ENGINE. WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR IN 11/99 THE RECALL WAS ALREADY EXPIRED, BUT FORD HAS NO CONFIRMATION THE THE ORIGINAL OWNER RECEIVED THE RECALL NOTICE. I FIND THE TWO OPTIONS THAT FORD HAS GIVEN ME TO FIX MY VEHICLE ARE NOT SATISFATORY, AND THAT FORD SHOULD BACK IT'S PRODUCTS AND FIND A MORE FEASIBLE WAY TO FIX MY VEHICLE (WITH SOME SORT OF WARRANTY) OR SHOULD INCUR MOST OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPAIR. I HAVE CALLED FORD'S CUSTOMER COMPLAINT LINE OVER THE LAST COUPLE DAYS. I AM VERY UNSATISFIED WITH THE RESULTS SO FAR. I REPORTED THE TROUBLE ON 11/29. I NOW HAVE TRIED TO ESCALATE THE PROBLEM TO A SUPERVISOR. THE CENTER ADVISED ME THAT A SUPERVISOR IS NOT AVALIABLE IMMEDIATELY AND WOULD TAKE 24-48 HOURS FOR ME TO RECEIVE A CALL BACK. I HAVE CALLED A TOTAL OF 3 TIMES AND BEEN TOLD THE SAME THING EVERY TIME. I AM OUT A VEHICLE AND NEED FORD'S HELP TO WORK WITH ME TO FIND A VIABLE SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM. I WISH THEY WOULD JUST WORK WITH ME SO WE COULD COME TO A SOLUTION. I THINK FORD SHOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF RESPONSIBLITY FOR THEIR PRODUCTS ESPECIALLY SINCE A RECALL WAS ON THE VEHICLE.",

THE CAR STARTS TO SHAKE, THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT ON THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS UP, THE CAR ACTS AS IF THERE IS NOT ENOUGH GAS GETTING TO THE ENGINE AND THE ENGINE EITHER CUTS OFF OR BEGINS TO CHUGG AND SHAKE ANY TIME THE CAR SLOWS OR STOPS.  I'M SURE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW FRIGHTENING THIS CAN BE SINCE I NEVER KNOW WHEN THIS SITUATION IS GOING TO OCCUR AND I'M PETRIFIED THAT IT WILL HAPPEN DURING RUSH HOUR ON A MAJOR ROAD CAUSING ACCIDENTS AND MAJOR DAMAGE.  THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED, I WAS WITHIN FEET OF A SERVICE STATION AND BROUGHT IT TO THEM.  THE CODE ON THE ENGINE LIGHT SENSOR WAS, \"EGR\".  THEY DID A 60,000 MILE SERVICE, CHECKED THE EMISSION SYSTEM, AND FOUND NOTHING.  AFTER 41 MILES, THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON AGAIN.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE SAME SERVICE STATION.  THEY REPLACED THE DPFE SENSOR.  I'VE SINCE TAKEN IT BACK TO THEM 3 OR 4 TIMES, WHENEVER THE CAR STARTS TO SHAKE AND THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT TURNS ON.  THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN THINK OF TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND ARE AT A LOSS AS TO WHAT TO DO.  THEY EVEN HAD A CLASS WITH 50 TECHNICIANS GIVEN BY THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DIAGNOSTIC MACHINE AND USED MY CAR AS THE EXAMPLE.  THEY TOOK APART THE ENTIRE EMISSION SYSTEM AND \"ROTO-ROOTED\" IT.  I DROVE LESS THAN 10 MILES AND THE CAR STARTED SHAKING AGAIN.  SO FAR, I'VE SPENT CLOSE TO $500.  BECAUSE THE GARAGE WHERE I ORIGINALLY TOOK IT DIDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM, THEY HAVEN'T BEEN CHARGING ME FOR RETURN VISITS.  I CONTACTED FORD'S CONSUMER HELP LINE ON MAY 2, 2000.  DAMIEN SAID THAT BECAUSE I'D HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE, HE THOUGHT THAT I WOULD GET SOME FINANCIAL HELP FROM FORD AND HE'D LET ME KNOW IN TWO DAYS.  WHEN I DIDN'T HEAR FROM HIM, I CALLED FORD AGAIN AND SPOKE WITH CAROL.  SHE SAID THAT I WOULD GET NO HELP AND THAT MY FIRST STEP WAS TO TAKE THE CAR TO A FORD DEALER & THAY WOULD HELP ME.
