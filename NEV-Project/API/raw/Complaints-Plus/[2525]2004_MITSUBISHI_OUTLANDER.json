THE LENSES ARE UNSAFE AND REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF NIGHT ILLUMINATION THAT THE LIGHTS ARE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE.

IN CONTACTING MITSUBISHI, THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEFECT WITH A TSB ISSUED IN 12/04 BUT HAVE NOT CLASSIFIED IT AS A RECALL. THEY HAVE ALSO DECLINED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. IN ESCALATING IT WITHIN THE MITSUBISHI ORGANIZATION, CASE [XXX] WAS OPENED AND A CASE MANAGER CONTACTED A LOCAL DEALER ON BEHALF TO SEE IF THEY WOULD ADDRESS AND THEY AGAIN DECLINED.

I FORTUNATELY WAS NOT HIT WHEN MY CAR PULLED TO THE RIGHT AND I PULLED OVER. THEY HAVE YOKAHAMA TIRES. THE CAR ONLY HAS 22000 MILES AND WE HAVE ROTATED THE TIRES. WHEN I CHECKED THE FRONT TIRES, THEY ARE COMPLETELY WORN. SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE.  I CALLED DON HERRING MITSUBISHI IN PLANO TX TO SEE WHAT THEY WOULD DO AND THEY JUST PUSHED IT OFF ON THE TIRE COMPANY AND SAID I'D HAVE TO FIND A RETAILER OF THOSE TYPES OF TIRES, EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE NEW ON THE CAR.  THIS WAS POTENTIALLY A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION, AND I SUSPECT NO ONE IS GOING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.  *NM",
