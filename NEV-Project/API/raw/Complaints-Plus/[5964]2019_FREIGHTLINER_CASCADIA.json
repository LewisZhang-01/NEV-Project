SO I DONT THING THEY WANT TO BE RAPED,   SO IDLING THE TRUCK SHOULD BE UP TO THE DRIVER NOT THE COMPANY. WITH OUT PROPER SLEEP YOU NOW HAVE SLEEP DRIVERS DRIVING 80,000 POUND WEAPONS ON THE FREEWAYS, FIRST PERSON KILLED WILL BE ON YOUR HEADS IF THIS ISNT TAKEN CARE OF.  CRASH PERVENTION SYSTEM ALL OK BUT WHEN DRIVING ON SLICK ROADS AND SOMEONE JUMPS IN FRONT OF YOU THE TRUCK SLAMS ON THE BRAKES AND WE DONT HAVE CONTROL ANYMORE, OH YEAH THIS IS SAFE NOT. THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED QUICKLY BEFORE SOMEONE DIES.",
