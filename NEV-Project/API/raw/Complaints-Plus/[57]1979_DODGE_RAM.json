THE FRAME SEPARATED 2\" AT THE WELD, JUST UNDER THE DRIVERS DOOR AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE THE WELD IS CRACKED.  THE FRAME IS READY TO BREAK IN 2.  LUCKILY IT WAS FOUND BEFORE SOMEONE DRIVING IT GOT KILLED OR KILLED SOMEONE ELSE ON THE HIGHWAY.  CHRYSLER WAS NOTIFIED BUT IT HAS BEEN 8 DAYS AND STILL HAVE NOT HEARD WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM.  THE TRUCK IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY, BUT ANYONE CAN SEE THAT WHEN IT WAS WELDED BY THE MANUFACTURER, THE WELDING DID NOT PENETRATE THE METAL.  ANOTHER WORDS, A VERY POOR WELDING JOB.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY MANY PEOPLE THAT OWN DODGE TRUCKS THAT THE FRAME IS VERY WEAK.  THEY ARE NOT TOUGH TRUCKS AS THEY ADVERTISE THEM TO BE.  NOW I HAVE A TRUCK SITTING IN MY YARD THAT IS STILL FINANCED AND NOT ABLE TO USE.  PEOPLE NEED TO BE AWARE.  IF THAT FRAME WOULD OF BROKE IN 2 GOING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AT HIGH SPEEDS, CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD OF HAPPENED?*AK",
