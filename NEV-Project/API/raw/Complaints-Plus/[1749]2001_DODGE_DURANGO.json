IN DOING MY RESEARCH THE AVERAGE FIX THAT THE DEALERS WILL DO COSTS BETWEEN 600-800.00  WHICH IS TO REPLACE THE MOTOR ASSEMBLY. THERE ARE LINKS ON VARIOUS FORUM FOR INSTRUCTIONS TO FIX YOURSELF FOR ABOUT 40.00 OROVOODMG A BETTER FIX THAT THE DEALERS WILL NOT PROVIDE, BUT IT IS COMPLICATED AND VERY LABOR INTENSIVE.  MY NUMBER ONE CONCERN IS TO BE SAFE AND HAVE SAFE PASSENGERS! TO BE ABLE TO BRING THIS INTO DODGE AND GET THIS PERMANENTLY FIXED AT NO COST TO ME. THERE ARE UNTOLD AMOUNTS OF DODGE DURANGO OWNERS OUT THERE WITH THIS SAME ISSUE, WHICH DODGE CURRENTLY WILL NOT RECALL. THE OTHER TWO ISSUES ARE INCREDIBLY DEFECTIVE BALL JOINTS. SINCE DODGE RECALLED THESE TRUCKS FOR THE BALL JOINTS MANY INCLUDING MINE PREVIOUS TO ME BUYING IT, WE'RE BROUGHT IN FOR RECALL REPAIR IN 2006. PLEASE NOTE THE SUSPENSION COMPONENTS COMPANY CALLED \"MOOG\" FIXED THIS DODGE ENGINEERING PROBLEM FOR THIS YEAR MAKE AND MODEL WITH THEIR OWN SPECIALLY DESIGNED BALL JOINT.  AS FAR AS THE BRAKES GO THIS A VERY HEAVY SUV, IN WHICH IF ONE NEEDS TO STOP QUICKLY AND THE BRAKES FAIL OR SKID THE WHEELS DUE TO LOCK UP THIS AGAIN LIKE THE SEATS IS A VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY ISSUE THAT DODGE NEEDS TO CORRECT.

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

HE EXPRESSED CONCERN STATING THAT HAD I BEEN TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED (I.E., ON THE FREEWAY) THE VEHICLE WOULD HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY FLIPPED & ROLLED AND I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE STANDING THERE TALKING TO HIM... IT TOOK HIM QUITE SOME TIME TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PULL THE CAR UP ONTO THE CAR CARRIER (USING THE WENCH) WITHOUT THE WHEEL SNAPPING OFF.

TWO DAYS LATER, WHILE MY 16 Y/O SON WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE, THE INTERIOR AND DASH LIGHTS (LATER TO LEARN THE HEADLIGHTS) WERE FLICKERING ON AND OFF.  I TOOK IT FOR A TEST RIDE AND ALL SEEMED NORMAL FOR FIRST FEW MILES, WHEN SUDDENLY THE DASH LIGHTS AND HEADLIGHTS STARTED TO FLICKER RAPIDLY.  A FEW SECONDS LATER THE HEADLIGHTS WENT OUT COMPLETELY FOR APPROXIMATELY 5-7 SECONDS AND CAME BACK ON.  THE HEADLIGHTS WENT OUT AGAIN AS I WAS PULLING OFF THE ROAD FOR APPROXIMATELY 7-10 SECONDS WITH INTERMITTENT INTERIOR DASH LIGHTS FLICKERING.  I TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF, REMOVED THE NEGATIVE BATTERY TERMINAL FOR APPROXIMATELY 3 MINUTES AND AGAIN ALL RETURNED TO \"NORMAL\".

COST FROM LOCAL DEALERS $690.00) YET THERE IS NO RECALL FOR THIS ANOMALY.  WHY?  HEADLIGHTS TURNING OFF WHILE DRIVING'AM I THE ONLY PERSON WHO SEES A SAFETY PROBLEM HERE?  ALSO, ACCORDING TO THE PEOPLE AT CHRYSLER'S 1-800 CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER, THIS IS ONLY AFFECTING A SMALL NUMBER OF VEHICLES.  SO WHAT.

MY CONCERN CONTINUES WITH THE BELIEF THAT BOTH CHRYSLER AND THE NHTSA KNOW ABOUT THIS FAILURE - WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A SAFETY ISSUE - AND NEITHER HAVE TAKEN ANY POSITIVE ACTION FOR AN IMMEDIATE RECALL.

THEY SAID THAT THE SERVICE WAS DONE AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT THEY CAN DO. 1YEAR LATER AND 1 SET OF TIRES, ON 5/20/07 I LOOKED MYSELF UNDER THE TRUCK AND LOOKED FOR WHAT THE FIRE STONE MANAGER TOLD ME TO LOOK AT. JUST TO FIND THAT THE SERVICE HAD NEVER BEEN DONE. THE REASON I DID THIS, BECAUSE FIRE STONE WOULD NOT REPLACE THE TIRES DUE TOO POOR UPKEEP. I HAD MOVED TO PINEVILLE LA WHEN ALL THIS TOOK PLACE. I WENT IN TO A DEALER THERE AND TOLD THEM MY STORY AND ASKED IF THEY WOULD LOOK AT THE PICTURES THAT I TOOK. THEY SAID YES AND THEY SAID THE SERVICE HAD NOT BEEN DONE ,SO THE CHECK INTO IT AND THE DEALER (WEST SIDE IN ILLINOIS HAD IT IN THE COMPUTER AS DONE ON THERE SITE.) THEY PUT IN THE WRONG VIN# .  THE DEALER IN LA DID THE RECALL, BUT I AM OUT  $60.00 , 1 SET OF TIRES, COST AND WORK OF THE LOWER BALL JOINTS (DUE TO UPPER BALL JOINTS GOING OUT) AND ALL THAT TIME RUNNING AROUND. WHAT SHOULD I DO ? A LAWYER COST TOO MUCH!  AND NOW I HAVE THE RECALL ON THE STEERING COLUMN GEAR SHIFT BLOCKER.  *TR",

IT NOW HAS 63,000 MILES ON IT AND I HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD ABOUT MAINTAINING THIS VEHICLE. ON 1-15-06 AS I APPROACHED AN INTERSECTION THAT IS AT THE BOTTOM OF A SLIGHT DOWNHILL GRADE I WAS TRAVELING ABOUT 30-35 MPH. AS I  WENT TO APPLY MY BRAKES THE BRAKE PEDAL IMMEDIATELY WENT SOFT BECAUSE OF THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES ACTIVATING. THE PAVEMENT WAS DRY AND I DID NOT INITIALLY HIT THE BRAKES ANY HARDER THAN NORMAL. I KEPT FIRM PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL THINKING THAT THE BRAKES WOULD COME BACK AS THEY HAVE IN THE PAST DURING SIMILAR SITUATIONS. HOWEVER THIS TIME THE BRAKES NEVER CAME BACK AND I ENDED UP REAR-ENDING THE VEHICLE STOPPED AT THE INTERSECTION.  I HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO STOP AND THE PAVEMENT WAS DRY SO. THE CLOSER I GOT TO THE STOPPED VEHICLE THE MORE PRESSURE I APPLIED TO THE PEDAL BUT EVERY TIME THE ANTI-LOCK MECHANISM WOULD COMPENSATE FOR THE ADDITIONAL PRESSURE AND NEGATE IT. THE  INCIDENT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME TO HAPPEN. I THINK THE LAST 3 SECONDS I WAS UNDER 10 MPH BUT STILL THE BRAKES COULD NOT STOP THE VEHICLE. I HAVE CHECKED MY BRAKE FLUID LEVEL AND INSPECTED MY FRONT BRAKES AND COULD NOT FIND ANY PROBLEMS.  THERE IS STILL ONE MORE THING THAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. THIS DURANGO IS SUPPOSED TO BE ONLY REAR ANTI-LOCK BRAKES YET I LOST MOST OF MY BRAKING ABILITY TO MY FRONT BRAKES.  THERE WAS ONLY MINOR DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE I HIT BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED I HAVE TO THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE. THE MOST DISTURBING ASPECT OF THIS WHOLE SITUATION IS THAT AS I GOT CLOSE TO THE STOPPED VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME I WAS NOT GOING VERY FAST YET THE TRUCK CONTINUED FORWARD FOR SEVERAL SECONDS UNTIL I HIT THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME. ALSO VERY DISTURBING IS WHY DID I LOOSE POWER TO MY FRONT BRAKES??? THERE IS NO QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT THIS ACCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY SOME KIND OF GLITCH IN THE ANT-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM OF MY DODGE DURANGO.  *JB",

I RUSHED OUTSIDE.UPON ARRIVING IN THE PARKING LOT I WAS STOPPED BY THE POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT FROM APPROACHING MY DURANGO AS THEY WERE AFRAID IT MIGHT EXPLODE.THE FLAMES WERE ALREADY FOUR FEET ABOVE THE HOOD.THE FIRE TOOK MY ENGINE, BUMPERS, LIGHTS, HOOD, FENDER, LEFT FRONT TIRE & SEVERALLY DAMAGED THE CAR DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF MINE & SLIGHTLY DAMAGED THE CAR TO THE LEFT CORNER. STATE FARM'S INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY THE IGNITION OF POWER STEERING FLUID ONTO HOT SURFACES OF THE EXHAUST SYSTEM WITH THE FIRE EXTENDING UPWARD AND OUTWARD, CAUSING THE DAMAGE PRESENT\" WHICH WAS THE TOTAL LOSS OF MY VEHICLE. I FILED A SPECIAL INVESTIGATION REPORT WITH CHRYSLER AND THEY SENT ME BACK A LETTER STATING THAT MY CLAIM WAS DENIED.  IN OTHER WORDS NOTHING WAS DONE BY CHRYSLER TO CORRECT THE FAILURE ALTHOUGH STATE FARM IS IN SUBROGATION AS THEY FOUND SEVERAL TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS # 19-005-03 AND 19-009-00 THAT THEY FEEL PERTAINED TO THIS EVENT.THE THIRD PARTY FIRE INVESTIGATOR INFORMED ME THAT THIS HAPPENED BEFORE, AND THAT THE PERSON THAT CHRYSLER SENT TO INSPECT  VEHICLE WAS NOT A LICENSED FIRE INSPECTOR, AND THAT MR. PITT (CHRYSLER'S REP.) WAS NOT QUALIFIED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE.I WROTE A LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT OF CHRYSLER AND THE DIRECTOR OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.  A MONTH LATER RECEIVED A CALL FROM THEM STATING AGAIN THAT MY CLAIM WAS DENIED, AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT TELL ME WHAT THEY DETERMINED CAUSED THE FIRE ON RECOMMENDATION FROM THEIR LEGAL STAFF.I REPLIED IT SOUNDED LIKE THEY WERE TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING, AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD REFER MY CLAIM BACK TO THE SPECIAL INVESTIGATION UNIT, AND I AM STILL WAITING FOR A RETURNED CALL.

WE CURRENTLY HAVE 30,000 MILES ON OR DURANGO AND I 'M GETTING READY TO PUT THE THIRD SET OF ROTORS ON THE FRONT END.  THE FIRST CHANGED SET WAS PUT ON AFTER ONLY 9200 MILES.   OF COURSE AT THE DEALERSHIP YOU GET THE BLAH, BLAH ABOUT HOW IT IS A NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR ITEM.  WHICH I AGREE IT IS;HOWEVER, IT IS NOT NORMAL TODAY OR YESTERDAY FOR ANY ROTOR ON ANY VEHICLE TO WARP SO BADLY AFTER ONLY 8000 MILES OF USE.  ROTORS WARP FROM EXCESSIVE HEAT BUILDUP-> THAT IS A FACT.  I DID FURTHER RESEARCH THROUGH VARIOUS DODGE DEALERSHIPS.  OF THE FIVE RESPECTIVE DEALERSHIPS CONTACTED ALL FIVE AGREED THAT THE ROTORS ARE UNDERSIZED AND ARE PRE-MATURELY WEARING ON ALL DODGE DURANGOS, BUT THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT.    WHEN I CHANGED THE ROTORS AFTER ONLY 8000 MILES I WAS FAIRLY SURPRISED TO SEE ALMOST NO WEAR ON THE FRONT BRAKE PADS.  REGARDLESS OF THIS SMALL AMOUNT OF WEAR I DECIDED TO REPLACE THE FRONT PADS WITH NEW HIGH END CERAMIC PADS WHICH HELP WITH REDUCING HEAT BY HELPING DISSIPATE HEAT THROUGH THE CERAMIC MEDIA.  AT 17,000 MILES WARPED ROTORS ON THE FRONT END AGAIN, CERAMIC PADS LOOKED GREAT.  I DO NOT PULL A BOAT/ RV OR ANYTHING ELSE ON MY VEHICLE.  I LIVE IN FLAT CORN COUNTRY NOT COLORADO WITH EXCESSIVE MOUNTAINS THAT WOULD PUT STRAIN ON THE BRAKING SYSTEM. BRAKES ARE THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT PART ON ANY VEHICLE, AND WHEN THEY ARE UNDERSIZED AND DON'T DISSIPATE HEAT CORRECTLY THEY WILL WARP EVERYTIME.  THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT IS NOT ISOLATED AND IS PREVALENT WITH EVERY 2001 DURANGO.  I HOPE I'M NOT WASTING MY FINGERS TIME AND THAT THIS HAS SOME IMPACT ON DODGE, SO THAT THEY MAY RIGHT THIS WRONG AND GET RECALL PERFORMED BEFORE SOMEONE OR MORE PEOPLE ARE KILLED AND INJURED FROM THIS CONDITION.  *JB",

AT 60,000 MILES I TOOK MY DURANGO INTO MY DEALER FOR ROUTINE SERVICE AND A STATE INSPECTION.  PLEASE TRY TO IMAGINE MY SHOCK WHEN I GOT A PHONE CALL FROM THE SERVICE MANAGER INFORMING ME THAT THE BALL JOINTS ON MY CAR WERE SO DANGEROUSLY WORN, THE CAR WOULD NOT PASS INSPECTION.  IF I DID NOT GET IT REPAIRED THEY WOULD HAVE TO RED-FLAG THE CAR BECAUSE IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS TO HAVE ON THE HIGHWAY. NOW REALLY, WHO WOULD WANT TO DRIVE A CAR THAT UNSAFE?  I WAS RELIEVED THAT THE MECHANIC DISCOVERED IT AND POSSIBLY PREVENTED A HORRIBLE ACCIDENT.  I HAD IT FIXED.  TOTALLY WORN OUT BALL JOINTS AT ONLY 60,000 MILES?
