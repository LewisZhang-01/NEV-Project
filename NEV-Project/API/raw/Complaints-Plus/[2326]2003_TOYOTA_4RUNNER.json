The frame design is similar to the 2005 to 2015 Tacomas, which experienced similar issues with rust damage causing frame integrity issues. Toyota had a program to replaced those frames, but not for the 4Runners. The issue seems to be caused by certain factory openings in the frame that allow road salt to enter into the frame cavity, and cause the inside to rust. Being next to the catalytic converter, the heat accelerates the rust. On my 4Runner, the issue has gotten worse in the last 2 years.

THE FRAME AND FRAME RAIL ROT ON THE 4RUNNER FROM THAT TIME PERIOD IS WELL DOCUMENTED AND MANY COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED WITH THE NHTA YET TOYOTA HAS SEEN FIT NOT TO RECALL THE 4RUNNER!! . WHAT A DISGRACE!!    THE MOST IMPORTANT FACT IS THE 4RUNNERS, PAST AND PRESENT, SIT ON THE EXACT SAME FRAME AS THE TACOMA. THE TACOMA WAS RECALLED FOR THE FRAME ROT BUT THE 4RUNNER WERE NOT.      COULD YOU PLEASE PROVIDE THE REASONING FOR NOT RECALLING THE 4RUNNER FOR FRAME ROT WHILE THE TACOMA WITH THE EXACT SAME FRAME FROM THE EXACT SAME FACTORY WAS NOT/HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED?",

THEY WANTED NEARLY $4500 TO FIX THE ISSUE.  NEW ENGINE WIRING HARNESS $1500-$2000 AND ANOTHER $1000 FOR THE LABOR AND THE REST OF THE ESTIMATE IS FOR OTHER PARTS NOT SPECIFIED.  THEIR SOLUTION IS TO CUT THE WIRE BELOW THE TRANSMISSION WIRING HARNESS CONNECTOR THEN SPLICE AND SOLDER BUT I WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE NEARLY ALL THE CRITICAL WIRING IN THAT CAR.  I CANT GIVE AN EXACT DATE ON WHEN IT STARTED GOING WRONG BUT I CAN LOOK AT THE SERVICE HISTORY ON THE TOYOTA OWNER'S WEBSITE AND GIVE YOU THIS TIMELINE.    0-89,997 -  NO, ISSUES WITH EMISSIONS OR ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS.     89,997MI - 90K SERVICE DONE - TRANSMISSION FLUID CHANGE W/FLUSH DONE AT DEALER.    98,152MI - CAR REPORTING LEAN CODES, DEALER REPLACES MAF SENSOR.    100,117 - CAR REPORTING LEAN CODES, DEALER REPLACES O2 SENSOR AND A/F SENSOR BANK 2 POSITION 1 & 2    105,312 - CAR REPORTING LEAN CODES, DEALER REPLACES BANK 1 POSITION 1 A/F SENSOR AND MAF SENSOR AGAIN.  TOTAL COST $798.76.    THERE ARE MORE BUT I HAVE CHARACTER LIMITS.  I WILL SAY THIS THOUGH THAT THE PROBLEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS BECAUSE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE FLUID WHEN YOU UNPLUG THE O2 SENSOR FROM THE HARNESS BUT TOYOTA WAS CONTENT CHARGING ME $500-$700 EVERY 10K MILES WITHOUT ACTUALLY FIXING IT.  CAR STILL REMAINED FUNCTIONAL BUT RUINED FUEL ECONOMY.",

INSPECTING THE CAR ON THE PASSENGER REAR SIDE WE FOUND THAT THE REAR SUSPENSION HAD PULLED AWAY FROM THE FRAME WHERE THE FRAME HAD COMPLETELY RUSTED LEAVING A BIG HUNK OUT OF THE FRAME. THERE WAS EXTENSIVE RUSTING OF THE FRAME IN MULTIPLE PLACES.   THE CAR WAS INSPECTED AND PHOTOGRAPHED BY MATT WARREN, SERVICE MANAGER AT CARVER TOYOTA AND WAS DETERMINED TO BE UNDRIVEABLE.

I DROVE IT AGAIN AND IT REMAINED WORSE. THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. I LEFT THINKING THAT IT WAS MY WHEELS AND OR MY TIRES BECAUSE IN MY MIND TOYOTA KNOWS BEST! I WENT TO WHERE THE TIRES WERE BOUGHT, TIRES ARE 3 MONTHS NEW. THEY INFORMED ME THAT THIS SAME 4RUNNER HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN BY THE PREVIOUS OWNER WITH THE EXACT SAME ISSUE. THEY PULLED THE WHEELS OFF AND PULLED ME ASIDE TO SHOW ME HOW EXCESSIVE THE BALANCING WEIGHTS WERE ON EACH RIM AND SOME ALL THE WAY AROUND RIM (TOYOTA'S DOING). THEY BALANCED USING THE HAWEKA, IT DROVE BETTER BUT STILL VIBRATING AT 32-70MPH. THEY RE-BALANCED AGAIN, STILL SAME ISSUE. THEY USED A DIFFERENT SET OF WHEELS AND BALANCED AGAIN, SAME ISSUE.

I COMPARED THIS TO OTHER MANUFACTURERS HITCHES (E.G. GMC, CHEVROLET, JEEP, ETC) AND THEY ALL HAVE A 2.5 INCH DISTANCE FROM THE END OF THE RECEIVER TO THE HOLE FOR THE PIN.     I CONTACTED TOYOTA TO FIND OUT WHETHER THIS IS THE CORRECT PART AND WHY THEY CHANGED THE DESIGN IN THAT WAY, BUT THEY WERE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION.    IN MY OPINION, THE NEW HITCH RECEIVER IS UNSAFE AS IT ALLOWS MORE PLAY OF THE BALL MOUNT AND APPEARS LESS STABLE AS LESS MATERIAL IS AROUND THE HITCH RECEIVER PIN.

THERE IS NO ROD OR OTHER MECHANICAL DEVICE TO HOLD THE HOOD OPEN, JUST THE PISTON.  THE HOOD STAYS OPEN FOR A FEW MINUTES, THEN QUIETLY FALLS, AT FIRST VERY SLOWLY FOR A FEW INCHES, THEN RAPIDLY ENOUGH TO POSSIBLY CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY TO A PERSON LEANING OVER THE OPEN ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  THE HOOD IS FAIRLY HEAVY PROBABLY DUE TO THE THICK AND HEAVY FIBERGLASS INSULATION. THE PISTON WORKED PROPERLY UNTIL ABOUT EARLY 2009 WHEN IT STARTED OCCASIONALLY FALLING, NOW (APRIL 2010) THE HOOD FALLS AFTER A FEW MINUTES EVERY TIME THE HOOD IS OPENED.  SINCE THIS STARTED HAPPENING I'VE BEEN USING A WOOD STICK I CUT TO SIZE TO HOLD THE HOOD OPEN WHEN I NEED ACCESS.  NOW I'M GOING TO HAVE THE PISTON REPLACED BUT I'LL ASK FOR THE REMOVED PARTS BACK IN CASE THEY NEED TO BE EXAMINED.  EVEN WITH THE NEW PISTON, THOUGH, I INTEND TO USE THE WOOD STICK AS A SAFETY MEASURE.  I JUST DON'T TRUST THE PISTON DESIGN SINCE IT APPARENTLY REQUIRES PERFECT SEALING TO MAINTAIN THE LIFTING FORCE.  ALSO, ACCORDING TO MY INDEPENDENT AUTO REPAIR SHOP THAT DOES MAINLY TOYOTA'S, THIS IS A FREQUENT ENOUGH PROBLEM THAT THEIR REPAIRMEN ALWAYS BRACE THE HOODS OPEN WHEN WORKING IN ENGINE COMPARTMENTS.

I HAVE READ NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS HERE, EDMUNDS, AND OTHER WEBSITES ON THIS TOPIC AND SEE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE OF SOME PEOPLE PURSUING LEGAL RECOURSE. OTHER THAN ONE SPECIFIC CASE IN FLORIDA, I CANNOT FIND ANY OTHER EVIDENCE OF SUCCESSFULLY MAKING A LEMON LAW CASE WITH THE SULFUR SMELL PROBLEM.    I AM IN KANSAS AND HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED BY TOYOTA THAT I HAVE TO GO TO ARBITRATION.....AND IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN, THIS IS ALSO REQUIRED PRIOR TO ATTEMPTING A LEMON LAWSUIT.  I HAVE THREE KIDS, ONE OF WHICH HAS A SULFUR ALLERGY IN ADDITION TO MY WIFE HAVING A DOCUMENTED ALLERGY. FRANKLY, I HAVE BEEN NAUSEATED BY THIS SMELL ON A NUMBER OF INSTANCES. NOW AT 10 MOS. OF OWNERSHIP, 7500 MILES, TRYING EVERY GRADE AND BRAND OF GAS REASONABLY AVAILABLE, 2 DEALER COMPLAINTS, AND 2 TOYOTA CORPORATE COMPLAINTS....I AM NOT ONLY DISAPPOINTED AT TOYOTA'S SHIFTING OF BLAME....BUT NOW I AM AT A LOSS ON WHAT CAN BE DONE TO HAVE TOYOTA RECOGNIZE AN OBVIOUS DESIGN FLAW IN THE CURRENT 4RUNNER MODEL.     TOYOTA BLAMES THE PROBLEM ON BAD GAS....DON'T THINK SO...I HAVE TRIED EVERY GRADE FROM EVERY STATION NEAR MY HOUSE. IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE DAY 1 OF OWNERSHIP. HAVE I RESEARCHED THIS TO FIGURE OUT WHY IT HAPPENS....ABSOLUTELY. WHEN TOYOTA SAYS IT IS NOT THEIR FAULT.....I GUESS I WONDER WHY THEY DESIGNED THE VEHICLE TO HAVE REAR VENTS THAT PULL EXHAUST GAS INTO THE CABIN. THIS IS EXACTLY WHY IT HAPPENS.    HERE IS MY POINT....SULFUR SMELL FROM THE EXHAUST...OK, I'M GOOD WITH THAT. THIS IS THE CASE WITH THE HIGHER SULFUR CONTENT MIXES THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. BUT SHOULD IT BE REASONABLE THAT I HAVE TO INHALE IT INSIDE THE CABIN? NOW HOW IS THAT THE FAULT OF THE GASOLINE INDUSTRY.....DOES THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SULFUR CONTENT OF THE LOCALLY AVAILABLE GASOLINE? FURTHERMORE, IF I AM SMELLING SULFUR.....I AM ALSO INHALING CARBON MONOXIDE....GEE, THAT SEEMS REAL HEALTHY. PLEASE HELP.",

WHEN I COMPLAINED TO TOYOTA I WAS TOLD THE ODOR WAS CAUSED BY THE GAS I USE. I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM BEFORE AND TOYOTA JUST WASHES THEIR HANDS OF IT. I WAS GIVEN A PAPER WHICH PURPORTS TO BE A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN. IT STATES: FEB 24 2003 - SOME OWNERS OF TOYOTA VEHICLES MAY EXPERIENCE A SULFUR LIKE OR ROTTEN EGG ODOR FROM THE EXHAUST SYSTEM. SULFUR IS A NATURAL COMPONENT OF CRUDE OIL FROM WHICH GASOLINE IS REFINED AND THE AMOUNT OF SULFUR CAN BE DECREASED THROUGH THE REFINING PROCESS. THE AMOUNT OF SULFUR IN FUEL SOLD IN CALIFORNIA IS REGULATED; HOWEVER, GASOLINE SOLD IN OTHER STATES CAN HAVE A HIGHER SULFUR CONTENT. SULFUR CONTENT ALSO VARIES CONSIDERABLY BETWEEN GASOLINE BRANDS AND LOCATIONS. APPLICABLE VEHICLES ALL MODELS REPAIR PROCEDURE  : A SULFUR ODOR EMITTED FROM THE VEHICLES TAILPIPE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INDICATE THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE VEHICLES RUNNING CONDITION BUT IS MOST LIKELY DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE FUEL. IF VEHICLES IS EXHIBITING AN EXCESSIVE SULFUR ODOR THE FOLLOWING CHECKS SHOULD BE PERFORMED IF THE MIL LIGHT IS ON CHECK FOR DTC'S AND REPAIR AS NECESSARY INFORMATION TROUBLE IS FOUND AFTER PERFORMING THE ABOVE CHECK RECOMMEND THE CUSTOMER TRY A DIFFERENT SOURCE OF FUEL. REPLACEMENT OF OXYGEN SENSORS, AIR/FUEL RATIO SENSORS OR CATALYTIC CONVERTERS WILL NOT REDUCE THE ODOR AND THEREFORE NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR WARRANTY  (SOUNDS LIKE A COP-OUT TO ME)  TOYOTA SHOULD LOOK FOR A SOLUTION.  *LA",

THE VSC SYSTEM IS A SKID CONTROL SYSTEM THAT MONITORS THE VEHICLE AND UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, MODIFIES THE VEHICLE PERFORMANCE BY CONTROLING THE THROTTLE OR BRAKES IN AN ATTEMPT TO PREVENT SKID, OR LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE HAS LESS THAN 1000 MILES ON IT, AND 3 REPAIRS HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTED BY THE DEALER, NONE OF WHICH HAVE FIXED THE PROBLEM. SO FAR THEY HAVE REPLACED THE ECM, THE STEERING WHEEL POSITION SENSOR, AND A DISC WHICH THE STEERING WHEEL POSITION SENSOR \"READS\" TO DETERMINE THE STEERING WHEEL POSITION. THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS AND I AM ABOUT TO RETURN THE VEHICLE FOR A FOURTH ATTEMPT AT REPAIR.",
