I had no warning this was coming and now look towards a hefty repair bill. GMC has recalled vacuum pumps in other models but for some reason the terrain is not included.

October 31,2021 Sunday, I had sudden lost of my brakes/stalled on my 2019 Terrain SLE while driving to the store close to my area on top of that having less than 30,000 miles in it. Despite the horrible and devastating event I was able to have the truck without any scratch , hit , or had any accident on this event but instead still safely stopped the car down a hill from where I lost my brakes/stalled.

Found no spots in the tape where it was rubbed through but lost comms when wires were shook. Unwrapped main engine harness loom and inspected wires, found nothing. Started TAC Case # 9-6385087421 and was told it probably is a chaffed comms wire somewhere and gave me multiple locations to check. Found no damaged wires in those locations and shaking main harness no longer would make it fault. Put it all together and drove it down the road and faulted immediately. Unwrapped main harness again snd sprayed with saltwater to help conductivity but still couldn't get it to fault while shaking the harness. Only way it will fault is when shifting into drive the drive train bumps just right to bend the right wire. Checked every wire I could find and can't find the problem wire. Not drivable. When this vehicle faults it will not shift past 1st gear and sometimes locks out reverse. Must be towed.

THIS WAS MY FIRST BRAND NEW CAR AND I WAS EXCITED. I TRADED IN A 2014 GMC TERRAIN IN THE PROCESS, KNOWING I WOULD BE UPSIDE DOWN ON THE LOAN. I HAD THE FIRST SERVICE DONE ON APRIL 23, 2019 AT SAID DEALERSHIP. AT THAT VISIT I EXPLAINED THAT I WAS HEARING A NOISE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE VENT EVEN WHEN THE HVAC WAS NOT RUNNING. I WAS TOLD NOTHING WAS DETECTED AND MY VEHICLE WAS FINE  ON MAY 24, 2019, I DROVE MY VEHICLE TO MEMPHIS TENNESSEE WITH MY FAMILY FOR MEMORIAL DAY. ON MAY 25, 2019 THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, I WAS LOSING POWER TO THE ENGINE. THAT SAME NIGHT CUSTOMER SERVICE TOWED MY VEHICLE TO SUNRISE CHEVROLET BUICK GMC, 1800 COVINGTON PIKE MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE 38128, A NEARBY GMC DEALERSHIP AND SET UP A RENTAL CAR IN THE AREA FOR ME TO DRIVE. BECAUSE IT WAS THE HOLIDAY, ENTERPRISE WAS CLOSED, AND I HAD NO VEHICLE TO DRIVE FOR TWO DAYS. THIS WAS AN INCONVENIENCE TO ME AND MY FAMILY, I HAD TO ALTER MY TRIP PLANS THAT WERE MADE BACK IN FEBRUARY 2019.  ON MAY 27, 2019 I WAS TOLD BY [XXX] THE TECHNICIAN AT SUNRISE CHEVROLET THAT AIR BOX TUBE WAS LOOSE AND NOT PROPERLY INSTALLED AND COULD HAVE BEEN DONE DURING MY SERVICE I HAD DONE APRIL 23RD. I WAS ASSURED EVERYTHING WAS OKAY AND I WAS GOOD TO GO. ON MAY 31, WHILE TRAVELING BACK HOME THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN. SAME MESSAGE ON THE DASH AND IT WAS RAINING AT 3AM. I WAS CLOSE TO HOME AND WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT I PURCHASED IT FROM.   MY VEHICLE HAS BEEN IN SERVICE SINCE MAY 31, 2019 AND I AM JUST FINDING OUT THAT I HAVE A PART THAT IS ON NATIONAL BACK ORDER.
