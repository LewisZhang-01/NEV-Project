I WAS TOLD THE REAR END WILL EVENTUALLY COLLAPSE AND CAR WILL NOT BE DRIVABLE. CURRENTLY, THERE IS VERY LITTLE ROOM BEFORE STRUT MOUNTS WILL TOUCH BOTH REAR TIRES DUE TO RUSTED STRUT TOWERS, A DEFINITE SAFETY CONCERN.

SO IT'S A HUGE MOISTURE TRAP, CAUSING RUST TO OCCUR. LATER YEARS GM PUT IN PLASTIC SHIELDS IN THE WHEEL WELLS. AND WHETHER THEY PUT A SEALER IN WHERE THE METAL PANELS OVERLAP WASN'T MENTIONED.    THIS 15 YEAR OLD CAR HAS VERY LITTLE OVERALL BODY RUST, BELOW AVERAGE MILES, MECHANICALLY RUNS GREAT AND HAS MANY MORE MILES TO GO.

THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCE FAR EXCEEDS ANY BENEFIT FROM PROTECTING YOUR CAR FROM BEING STOLEN BY USING A FAULTY PASSCODE SYSTEM. THE REMEDY WOULD BE SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE FOR GM TO FIX BY EITHER SUPPLYING NEW FIRMWARE TO BYPASS THE COMPUTER PASSCODE SYSTEM OR EVEN CHEAPER - THE WIRING HARNESS PASSCODE BYPASS CURRENTLY FOR SALE BY AN INDEPENDENT VENDOR.  *TR",

MY FOOT FELT NORMAL BRAKE RESISTANCE FOR AN INSTANT AND THEN THE BRAKE PEDAL SUDDENLY WENT TO THE FLOOR. FORTUNATELY, AS MY SLOWING WAS NOT CRITICAL AT THAT MOMENT, THE FAILED BRAKING DID NOT RESULT IN A DISASTER.  DURING MY DIAGNOSIS OF THE PROBLEM, ON APPLYING THE BRAKES MUCH BRAKE FLUID LEAKED ON THE GROUND BELOW THE MASTER CYLINDER, BUT NOT INVOLVING THE MASTER CYLINDER. CLOSER INSPECTION I DISCOVERED THAT THE BRAKE LINE CROSSING THE FIREWALL TO THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL (ABOUT 12 INCHES BELOW THE MASTER CYLINDER AND A FEW INCHES TOWARD THE PASSENGER SIDE) WAS ASSEMBLED SUCH THAT IT IS EMBEDDED IN FELT (WHICH APPARENTLY PROVIDES SOUND DEADENING FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT) UP AGAINST THE FIREWALL FOR ABOUT 6 INCHES. THIS FELT HOLDS WATER AND REMAINS WET ALMOST CONTINUOUSLY IN THE NORTH CAROLINA ENVIRONMENT. THERE IS EXTENSIVE RUST ON THE BRAKE LINE IN THIS AREA - AND IT IS RUSTED THROUGH, WITH BRAKE FLUID SQUIRTING OUT WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED. THIS IS VERY STUPID AND DANGEROUS DESIGN PATH FOR THIS BRAKE LINE - IT SHOULD BE INSTALLED SUCH THAT IT DOES NOT CONTACT THE FELT. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IT WAS ASSEMBLED THIS WAY (THE LINE IS NOT FLEXIBLE AT THIS POINT) - FIRMLY FORCED UP AGAINST THE FELT ON THE FIREWALL AND HELD IN THIS POSITION BY FASTENERS - NOT DUE TO ANY MOVEMENT OF THE LINE AFTER ASSEMBLY. THIS UNNECESSARY FAILURE DUE TO STUPID DESIGN MAY WELL HAVE RESULTED IN A SERIOUS OR EVEN FATAL ACCIDENT, VERY POSSIBLY INVOLVING A PEDESTRIAN AND/OR ONE OR MORE AUTOMOBILES. ACCESS TO REPLACE THIS LINE WILL REQUIRE THE CAR TO BE ON A LIFT, WHICH I AM UNABLE TO PROVIDE, SUCH THAT I WILL HAVE TO PAY GOOD MONEY TO HAVE IT FIXED. THIS WILL MOST ASSUREDLY BE A PROBLEM (LIKELY RESULTING IS SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH) ON OTHER 2000 ERA IMPALA'S.  *TR",

I WAS TOLD BY SEVERAL REPAIR PROFESSIONALS THIS IS SUCH A COMMON PROBLEM THEY KNOW AS SOON AS A IMPALA ROLLS THROUGH THE DOOR, EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. \"\"I BELIEVE GM SHOULD TAKE OWNERSHIP FOR USING A DEFECTIVE PART AS NO OTHER VEHICLES HAVE SUCH POOR FAILURE RATE, NOR HAVE I EVER IN MY 58 YEARS OF LIVE AND OWNERSHIP OF 15 CARS/TRUCKS EVER HAD TO REPLACE AN INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET BECAUSE OF DETERIORATION. JUST SEARCH THE INTERNET AND YOU WILL FIND A MILLION PEOPLE OF THE SAME ISSUE. IF THEY KNEW WHERE TO COMPLAIN, I AM SURE YOU WOULD BE SWAMPED. I HOPE SOMETHING CAN BE DONE TO HELP ALL OF THE OWNERS.

MY SISTER HAD THIS PROBLEM AND AT TIMES WOULD HAVE TO TURN THE KEY IN THE IGNITION TO \"ON POSITION\" AND WAIT 10 MINUTES. AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF RESEARCH I WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT TO RESET THE PASSLOCK SYSTEM THE KEY NEEDED TO BE LEFT IN THE IGNITION SWITCH IN THE \"ON POSITION\" THEN REMOVED AND REPEATED TWO MORE TIMES (3 TIMES, 30 MINUTES TOTAL). AFTER DOING THIS I HAD NO MORE PROBLEMS. MY ONLY PROBLEM IS THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE NOT MECHANICALLY INCLINED, AND PLENTY OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO HAD THEIR VEHICLES TOWED AND FACE A DIAGNOSIS FEE (AND PLENTY OF TIMES MISDIAGNOSIS). ACCORDING TO ALL THE INFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE CHEVY/GM HAS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS AND I CONSIDER IT SHAMEFUL THAT THEY DO NOT ALLOW SOME KIND OF CONCESSION OR MODIFICATION SO THAT A CUSTOMER OF THEIRS WITH A LEGITIMATE KEY CANNOT START THE VEHICLE.   *TR",

I HAVE OWNED MANY OTHER VECHILES AND AS LONG AS I MAINTAINED THEM THEY RAN GREAT UNTIL 100,000 PLUS MILES. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM AND WHY IS THERE NOT A RECALL ON THIS ENGINE? NOT IMPRESSED. I THOUGHT GOING GMC WOULD GIVE ME A RELIABLE VEHICLE. I NOW HAVE TO PUT IN OVER $1,000 OR REPLACE THE ENGINE FOR $3,000 TO $4,000. WHEN I GO TO PURCHASE ANOTHER VEHILE I WILL KEEP THIS IN MIND!!!!!",

I SPOKE WITH A DEALERSHIP ADVISOR FROM THE DEALERSHIP I BOUGHT THE CAR AND DIDN'T SEEM CONCERNED AND SAID IF I WANTED A NEW MIRROR OF THIS TYPE IT WOULD COST BETWEEN $200AND $300 . I SAID NO AT THAT TIME .

I WENT TO A CHEVY DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THIS INCIDENT WITNESSED AND RECORDED IN MY CAR FILE . TWO SERVICE MANAGERS SAID THEY HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE . THE FOLLOWING MONDAY I WENT TO THE CAR DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT THE CAR TO INQUIRE ABOUT MY OPTIONS AND TO HAVE THEM ACTUALLY SEE THE PROBLEM . ON THE WAY OVER I TOUCHED THE BOTTOM OF THE MIRROR AND FOUND A GOOEY BLACK SUBSTANCE ON MY FINGERS . APPARENTLY THE BOTTOM HAD MELTED . THE SERVICE PEOPLE SAID THERE MUST HAVE BEEN AN ELECTRICAL SHORT THAT OCCURED . BUT COULDN'T EXPLAIN ANYTHING ELSE . THE WARRANTY HAD RUN OUT SO THEY SUGGESTED I CALL CHEVY CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR HELP . THEY SET UP A FILE FOR MY COMPLAINT BUT FOUND NO ONE ELSE HAD REPORTED SUCH A PROBLEM . THEY CALLED THE DEALERSHIP TO VERIFY MY STORY AND AGREED EVERYTHING I SAID WAS TRUE . BUT WOULD NOT REPLACE THE MIRROR BECAUSE THE WARRANTY HAD RUN OUT AND BECAUSE OF THE MILEAGE . ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP THE MILEAGE WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE . THE CHEVY REP DID SAY THAT FOR CUSTOMER LOYALTY THEY WOULD GIVE ME A $500 CERTIFICATE IF I WANTED TO BUY A NEW CAR . $200-$300 IS STILL ALOT OF MONEY FOR ME TO INVEST .

NOW THE TRACTION OFF AND THE BRAKE WORNING LIGHTS ARE COMING ON WITH THIS VIBRATION.     BLINKERS WILL BE WORKING FINE, THEN THEY WILL JUST QUIT. WHEN THIS HAPPENS BOTH DIRRECTIONS WILL NOT WORK. 30 MINUTES LATTER THEY WORK FINE. PROBLEM WILL NOT STAY LONG ENOUGH TO FIND SOURCE.    AIR BAG LIGHT COMES ON AND OFF JUST LIKE THE TURN SIGALS.     SINCE WHEN DO DEALERSHIPS CHARGE A MINIMUM OF 200 DOLLARS FOR AN ESTIMATE.    THEY ALSO DID NOT REPAIR RECALL OF COOLANT LEAK. THEY SAID THEY DO NOT HAVE THE PART.

ALSO BAY COUNTY SHERIFF DEPTARTMENT DEPUTIES ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT BACK PAIN.  REASON THEY HAVE THE BACK PAIN IS BECAUSE THE TORQUE THEY HAVE TO EXPERT ON THIS STIFF STEERING (WHICH IS MUCH MORE THEN IN THE PAST) TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL GOES DIRECTLY TO THE SMALL OF THEIR BACK IN THEIR HIPS, BECAUSE THE HIPS ARE SECURED TO THE SEAT BY THE SEAT BELT.  THE SEATS ARE VINYL, AND THE EXCESSIVE TORQUE TRANSMIT TO THE SECURED PART OF THE BODY (THUS BEING THE BACK/HIP AREA).  THE STEERING WHEEL TORQUE REQUIRED TO TURN THE WHEEL GOES FROM A STATE OF THE MUSCLES BEING RELAXED TO AND IMMEDIATE TAUNTNESS WHICH RESULTS IN A SHOCK LOAD TO THE JOINTS IN THE BONES.

CHEVROLET HAS BEEN CALLED SEVERAL TIMES CONCERNING THIS ISSUE.  NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE.  IN FACT THEY ARE REFUSING TO HELP WITH THIS PROBLEM.  THEY HAVE DECLARED THIS AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE AND NOTHING CAN BE DONE TO FIX IT.  THAT IS UNTRUE.  THE DESIGN OF THE GAS TANK IS WHAT IS AT FAULT AND CHEVROLET WILL NOT ACCEPT THAT.    HERE'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU DO TO PROVIDE RESOLUTION: I WOULD LIKE CHEVROLET TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND THAT THIS IS NOT AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE AS I'VE BEEN REPEATEDLY TOLD IT IS.

I HAVE CONTACTED GM'S ASSISTANCE LINE MANY TIMES AND JUST GOT THE \"RUN AROUND\" WITH OPERATORS DOCUMENTING CONVERSATION AND NO ONE WOULD LET ME TALK TO A \"REAL\" SUPERVISOR.  ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS ASK FOR A FAIR SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS THAT THE DEALERS AND GM KNOW THAT THEY HAVE.  MY VEHICLE IS NOW OUT OF WARRANTY WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS SINCE I BOUGHT IT.

UNFORTUNATELY, DRIVERS WHO USE AUTOMATICS EXPECT THE TRANSMISSION TO HOLD THE VEHICLE, AT LEAST PARTIALLY, WHEN ON AN INCLINE.  IT IS TYPICAL TO USE ONE FOOT TO MOVE FROM THE BRAKE TO THE THROTTLE, BUT ON STEEP INCLINES, THE VEHICLE WILL ROLL SO QUICKLY THAT USING TWO FEET IS OFTEN NECESSARY (ONE FOR BRAKE, ONE FOR THROTTLE) WHEN MOVING OFF A STOP.  OBVIOUS SAFETY ISSUES ARE:  VEHICLE ROLLING INTO SOMEONE, VEHICLE ROLLING INTO AN OBJECT OR ANOTHER VEHICLE, UNNECESSARY AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT, AND DRIVER DISORIENTATION RESULTING FROM THE EQUIPMENT NOT WORKING AS EXPECTED, WITH POSSIBLE RESULTING ACCIDENT.  DEALER SAYS THIS CONDITION IS CONSIDERED NORMAL, BUT I HAVE DRIVEN MANY VEHICLES WITH AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS AND HAVE NEVER HAD ONE RESPOND IN THIS MANNER, AT LEAST TO THIS DEGREE.  THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY A DESIGN DEFECT, AND AT THE VERY LEAST, GENERAL MOTORS SHOULD INFORM BUYERS THAT THESE VEHICLES RESPOND DIFFERENTLY THAN OTHERS.  ONE REASON WHY I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE IS FOR ITS SAFETY TEST RESULTS, BUT THIS PROBLEM MAKES ME CONCERNED THAT THE VEHICLE IS ACTUALLY UNSAFE FOR MY WIFE TO DRIVE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES--SHE HAS ALREADY TOLD ME THAT SHE WILL NOT DRIVE IN DOWNTOWN SEATTLE (STEEP STREETS) WITH THE VEHICLE.  SHE IS NOT A HIGHLY SKILLED DRIVER, AND OPERATING THE CAR ON INCLINES WITHOUT EXERCISING EXTRA CAUTION, OR USING TWO FEET (WHICH REQUIRES ADDITIONAL SKILL) COULD EASILY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.
