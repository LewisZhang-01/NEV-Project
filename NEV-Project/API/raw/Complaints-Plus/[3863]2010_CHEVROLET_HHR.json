This fuel leak is right alongside the exhaust system which created a very unsafe scenario that could have easily resulted in an explosion and / or fire while driving this vehicle.  I did some research and it appears that vehicles like mine are all experiencing a similar problem.  I took my car to the Chevy dealer and it cost me $940 to fix this problem.  With so many owners of similar vehicles having the exact same problem I believe this should have been covered under a General Motors recall and those who had to pay to get this fixed should be reimbursed.  I have attached a copy of the receipt for the work done by the Chevy dealer for your informtion.  I did notice that an investigation has been underway to determine if GM should recall vehicles for this problem.  Had I been driving on the highway and not realized there was a gasoline leak right by the exhauset pipe it could have been a very tragic situation for me and my family.  Thank you for looking into this and please let me feel free to contact me if you have any questions, etc.",

TO EXIT THE VEHICLE, IT IS NECESSARY TO EITHER ROLL DOWN WINDOW AND OPEN DOOR BY PULLING EXTERIOR DOOR HANDLE, OR ANOTHER OCCUPANT OF THE VEHICLE MUST EXIT THE VEHICLE TO OPEN THE DOOR FROM OUTSIDE. IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY, THIS COULD RESULT IN FURTHER INJURY OR DEATH TO OCCUPANT(S) BEING UNABLE TO QUICKLY EXIT THE VEHICLE.     I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES THIS HAS BEEN REPORTED TO THE NHTSA, BUT THERE ARE MANY SUCH CASES THAT CAN BE FOUND BY SEARCHING THE INTERNET. IN FACT, IT IS SUCH A COMMON OCCURANCE THAT DORMAN MANUFACTURING SELLS A REPLACEMENT DOOR HANDLE REPAIR KIT FOR THE CHEVROLET HHR BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL INTERIOR DOOR HANDLE IS RIVETED TO THE INTERIOR DOOR PANEL, AND CHEVROLET/GM WOULD OTHERWISE REQUIRE ENTIRE INTERIOR DOOR PANEL TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY $400, EXCLUDING LABOR.

AFTER FINDING OUT ON GOOGLE THAT CARS LIKE MINE HAD BEEN RECALLED I CALLED MY CHEVY DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT MY CAR DID NOT QUALIFY FOR FREE REPAIR, EVEN THOUGH OF CORRECT MAKE AND YEAR. THEY DID NOT SEEM TO CARE AT ALL THAT I WAS STRANDED AND WOULD NOT GIVE ME AN APPOINTMENT UNTIL 3 DAYS LATER, BUT TOLD ME TO CALL GM AS THEY DID NOT SEEM TO WANT TO DEAL WITH ME. I CALLED GM AND THEY SAID THE SAME THAT THE CAR HAD NOT BEEN RECALLED FOR SOME REASON, AND DID NOT SEEM TO CARE EITHER. I TOOK MY CAR TO A REGULAR GARAGE, DRIVING IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SO THERE WOULD BE LESS TRAFFIC AND LESS RISK OF A CRASH AND THEY COULD NOT REPAIR IT AS THEY NEEDED THE GM SOFTWARE IN ORDER FOR THEM TO DO THAT, BUT THEY DID TELL ME THAT IT WAS THE SAME ISSUE AS THE ONES THAT WERE BEING RECALLED.

PREVIOUS RECALLS WERE THE IGNITION SWITCH AND THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM.  BUT I FOUND OUT THAT   THE KEY GETTING STUCK WHEN   THE CAR IS IN PARK, IS NOT A OFFICIAL \"RECALL ,BUT IT SHOULD BE! WE RECEIVED A LETTER WARNING US OF THE   PROBLEM AND IF IT OCCURRED, GM WOULD FIX IT FOR FREE. WELL, AS I REPORTED , IT   DID HAPPENED.  MY HUSBAND PARKED THE CAR, AND WE WERE PREPARING TO GO TO HIS DOCTOR\"S' APPT. &  TO  AN EVENING SERVICE & THE KEY GOT STUCK.   NO POWER, NO NOTHING, WE TRIED EVERYTHING. AND THAT THING THAT THE MANUAL SAID     WOULD HELP US RELEASE THE KEY, WAS NOT THERE.  SO THE CAR, SAT THERE  DRAINING THE BATTERY.  DR. APPT'S  WERE MISSED.     AND BECAUSE WE BOTH HAD APPT'S  COMING UP, WE HAD TO RENT A CAR.    BUT TO SUM IT ALL UP. WHEN THE TOLL DRIVER CAME, HE WAS ABLE TO JUMP THE CAR, AND THE KEY CAME OUT. AFTER TAKING THE CAR TO THE DEALER, THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. THEY SAID THAT THE BATTERY WAS GONE. BUT IT WAS FINE BEFORE THE KEY GOT STUCK.  THEY REFUSED TO CHANGE THE SHIFTER. WE GOT A NEW BATTERY, AND ARE PRAYING THAT WE WON'T GET STRANDED IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN. AND WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR OURSELVES AND FOR OTHERS!   NO  REIMBURSEMENT  FOR THE BATTERY OR THE RENTAL. WE HAVE MADE OUR COMPLAINTS TO   THE MANAGEMENT AT THE DEALER & TO GM. AND ONE MORE THING, OUR FIRST SIGN OF TROUBLE   BEFORE PARKING THE CAR, WAS THAT THE AIR BAG LIGHT WOULD NOT GO OFF.  AN ISSUE ALSO AFTER THE NEW  IGNITION SWITCH WAS PUT IN.  THIS IS A RECALL ITEM.  BUT ONCE AGAIN, GM   CARES MORE ABOUT  SAVING  A DIME.   NOT LIVES. NOT A SAFETY ISSUE?

THE NEXT DAY, THIS SAME PERSON TOOK THE VEHICLE IN TO HIS SHOP AND REPLACED THE \"IGNITION LOCK CYLINDER\" PER A \"SILENT\" GM RECALL. SOON AFTER THIS INCIDENT, I BEGAN HEARING ABOUT A GM RECALL ON THE \"IGNITION SWITCH\". I WAS THEN SENT A LETTER FROM GM TO THAT EFFECT. THE LETTER ALSO STATED THAT I COULD BE REIMBURSED FOR WORK DONE IF I HAD REPAIRS MADE ON MY OWN. WHEN I APPLIED FOR A REFUND FOR THE LABOR COST THAT I INCURRED, I WAS NOTIFIED BY THE TEAM CHEVY OF VALPARAISO, IN DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THAT I WOULD NOT BE COMPENSATED FOR BY EXPENSES BECAUSE THE CURRENT RECALL WAS FOR THE \"IGNITION SWITCH\" AND NOT THE \"LOCK CYLINDER\". I TRIED TO EXPLAIN THAT THE OTHER PART WAS ALSO A PART OF A PREVIOUS RECALL; HOWEVER, THE REP REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE WITH THE \"LOCK CYLINDER\". AFTER DOING SOME ONLINE RESEARCH, I HAVE FOUND THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED THIS SAME \"LOCKING IN THE RUN POSITION ISSUE\". FOR THIS REASON, AND THE FACT THAT GM IS ONCE AGAIN SLOW TO ACKNOWLEDGE A DANGEROUS DEFECT IN A VEHICLE WITH A HISTORY OF DANGEROUS DEFECTS, I AM WRITING TO FILE AN OFFICIAL COMPLAINT. AT THIS POINT, I DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN MY VEHICLE. I CURRENTLY HAVE TWO RECALLS OUT ON MY CAR AND HAVE ALREADY REPLACED BY POWER STEERING ASSIST MOTOR AFTER IT FAILED ON A BUSY HIGHWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF A LEFT HAND TURN. THERE ARE A SERIES OF MAJOR FLAWS WITH THIS VEHICLE AND GM NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SAFETY OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND MAKE THIS RIGHT.

YES, IT WAS PART OF THE RECALL,   BUT I NEED FOR YOU TO BE INFORM OF SOME THINGS, THAT I PRAY CAN HELP SOMEONE ELSE:    1. POWER ISSUES: THE POWER WOULD ACT SO CRAZY THAT WE NEVER KNEW WHEN IT WAS GOING TO SHUT OFF.  EXP. THIS PAST WINTER, THE BLOWER MOTOR WOULD BLOW COLD AIR, WHILE IT WAS FREEZING OUTSIDE! OR IT WOULD NOT   WORK AT ALL,  THEN, THE BLOWER HEATER WOULD COME ON, JUST  BY TURNING THE IGNITION ON. .  AND IT WOULD BLOW HOT AIR. AND IT WOULD NOT TURN OFF, UNLESS THE KEY WAS OUT OF THE IGNITION.  THE DASH WOULD GET VERY HOT,  SHOWING A POTENTIAL FOR A FIRE. APPARENTLY, EACH TIME A FUSE HAD BLOWN OUT.  WE WOULD REPLACE IT AND IN THREE WEEKS IT WOULD GO OUT AGAIN. SOMETHING ELECTRICAL MUST OF BEEN GOING ON. THERE WAS ALSO, POWER STEERING CONCERNS.   2.  WE TOOK IT IN TO SERRA CHEVROLET IN SOUTHFIELD, MICHIGAN TO HAVE   THE IGNITION SWITCH REPLACE.  WE WERE GIVEN A RENTAL, AND IT TOOK OVER THREE WEEKS FOR THE PART TO ARRIVE.  WE WERE HOPING THAT THE IGNITION SWITCH WAS CAUSING THE PROBLEM AND THAT IT WOULD GO AWAY, ONCE REPLACED.   3. ON JUNE 4TH, 2014-THE PARTS CAME IN..  4. ON THURSDAY, JUNE 5TH, 2014, THE NEW IGNITION SWITCH WAS REPLACED.   THE NEXT DAY, JUNE 6TH, 2014, THE BLOWER MOTOR WENT CRAZY AGAIN, AND THE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT   CAME ON.  ( WITH ALL OF THE ISSUES WITH THE CAR, THE AIRBAG LIGHT NEVER CAME ON UNTIL THE NEW IGNITION   SWITCH WAS INSTALLED.    5. AFRAID OF AN AIRBAG DISASTER TODAY, JUNE 9TH, 2014, MY HUSBAND TOOK THE CAR BACK TO SERRA CHEVROLET IN SOUTHFIELD, MICHIGAN.  THEY ARE SO BACKED UP, WITH CARS.  THEY CANNOT EVEN LOOK AT IT UNTIL TOMORROW.  MY HUSBAND WAS DROPPED OFF, NO RENTAL NO LOANER! AND NOW WE ARE WITHOUT A CAR, THANK YOU.

THESE AFTER BLOWER KITS ARE INSTALLED IN SOME OF THE CARS AND NOT OTHERS DEPENDING ON THE LOCATION OF SALES. I BOUGHT THIS AS A NEW CAR AT CINCINNATI DURING 2010 AND MOVED TO CHARLOTTE DURING 2011 TIME FRAME. DURING MAR 2013, I STARTED NOTICING THE BAD ODOR, BUT I CONVINCED MYSELF  THAT THIS WILL GO AWAY DURING SUMMER AND DIDN'T TAKE IT TO A DEALER AT THAT TIME. LATER, HOWEVER IT GOT WORSE AND I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER DURING DEC/2013. THE DEALER RECOMMENDED DEHUMIDIFYING THE EVAPORATOR CORE AND I WENT AHEAD DID IT. IT COST ME ~$110. IT SEEMED TO WORK FINE FOR A WEEK OR SO, BUT THE BAD ODOR RETURNED. I WAS GETTING SICK WITH THROAT INFECTION(S). ON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, I CAME TO KNOW ABOUT THIS TSB THAT I MENTIONED ABOVE. BUT THE DEALER DIDN'T DISCLOSE ABOUT THIS TSB TO ME IN FIRST PLACE, WHEN I TOOK THE CAR THERE DURING DEC/2013. I COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS TO GM AND MENTIONED THAT IT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO INSTALL THE MISSING AFTER BLOWER KIT. GM REPLIED TO ME SAYING THAT THEY CAN OFFER A COST ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO INSTALL THIS MISSING KIT AND COVER 1/2 THE COSTS BECAUSE MY CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY. TO ME, THIS IS A CLEAR DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING ISSUE. GM DIDN'T ADVISE ME (DURING PURCHASE OF THIS CAR) IF I MOVE OUT OF CINCINNATI AREA, I MAY NEED THIS AFTER BLOWER KIT TO AVOID MOLD AND MILDEW BUILD UP IN THE AC SYSTEM.

SINCE MY WARRANTY IS UP BECAUSE I AM OVER 14,000 MILES I AM HAVING TO FOOT THE BILL FOR THIS ITEM. THE CAR IS ONLY 3 YEARS OLD HAS NEVER HAD A WRECK NOR HAVE I SPILLED ANYTHING OR DONE DAMAGE TO THIS BUCKLE. I FEEL THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AND PAID FOR BY CHEVY. CARS FROM THE 60'S AND 70'S STILL HAVE THEIR ORIGINAL BUCKLES SO THEREFORE WHY AM I HAVING TO REPLACE ONE THAT IS 3 YEARS OLD?! I ALSO CALLED AROUND TO WRECKING YARDS TO POSSIBLY LOCATE THE PART AND COME TO FIND OUT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE HAVING THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THE GUY AT THE SHOP KNEW EXACTLY THE PART I WAS LOOKING FOR AND WHICH SIDE I WAS LOOKING FOR AS SOON AS I SAID HHR.   *TR",

MY MOTHER AND I WERE TRAVELING TO MY DAUGHTERS GRADUATION AND IT COMPLETELY LOCKED HER INSIDE. SHE COULD NOT GET THE DOOR OPENED AT ALL EVEN THOUGH I HIT THE UNLOCK BUTTON AND SHE TRIED MANY TIMES TO DO THE SAME THING ON HER SIDE. THE ACTUAL DOOR LOCK WAS IN THE UP POSITION SHOWING THAT THE DOOR APPEARED TO BE IN THE UNLOCK POSITION BUT WHEN SHE WENT FOR THE HANDLE IT WAS STILL LOCKED. THIS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES ON THIS DAY. IT EVEN SET MY ALARM SYSTEM ON MY CAR OFF BECAUSE AFTER IT REFUSED TO UNLOCK IT EVENTUALLY DID AND THEN REFUSED TO LOCK BACK. I GO AROUND AFTER GETTING OUT OF THE VEHICLE MAKING SURE ALL MY DOORS WERE SECURED AND IT WAS NOT LOCKED EVEN THOUGH THE LATCH WAS IN THE DOWN POSITION AND APPEARED TO BE SECURED. IS THIS A COMPUTER PROBLEM WITH THESE VEHICLES? I HAVE READ ABOUT PROBLEMS WITH THE OLDER MODEL HHR'S HAVING THIS PROBLEM BUT NOT ON A NEWER ONE OF THE YEAR I HAVE. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS CAN SOMEONE ACCESS MY COMPUTER BOARD IN MY VEHICLE AND SET THOSE LOCKS TO MESS UP? IT WAS ALMOST LIKE SOMEONE WAS MAYBE WANTING IN MY VEHICLE AND WHAT A BETTER WAY TO DO IT THAN TO MESS WITH THE LOCKING SYSTEM. I WOULD HAVE NEVER KNOWN MY VEHICLE WAS UNLOCKED HAD I NOT WENT OVER AND PHYSICALLY CHECKED IT THAT DAY BECAUSE LIKE I SAID IT APPEARED TO BE LOCKED.
