THE PROBLEM WAS IN THE LOW BEAM TO HIGH BEAM SWITCH.     THE INTERNALS OF THE SWITCH HAD ACTUALLY CRUMBLED APART CAUSING BOTH FRONT AND REAR LIGHTS TO FAIL. I WAS ABLE TO DO A ROADSIDE REPAIR TO GET THE LIGHTS WORKING ON GET HOME SAFELY. THE MOTORCYCLE HAS ONLY 1,434 MILES ON IT WHEN THE SWITCH FAILED (ALL THE BULBS WERE IN WORKING ORDER). I FEEL THAT HAVING THE LIGHTS GO OUT ON A MOTORCYCLE IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. BEING SEEN IS HARD ENOUGH WITH WORKING EQUIPMENT, NOT HAVING ANY LIGHTS CAN BE LETHAL. *TR",
