DESPITE THE FLASHING WARNING LIGHTS, THE BRAKES OPERATED NORMALLY ON DRY PAVEMENT.  HOWEVER, ON WET, SNOWY PAVEMENT THE ABS DID NOT WORK WHEN BRAKING FOR A STOP.

THE PERSON I SPOKE WITH AT THE AUDI DEALERSHIP DID NOT SOUND ALARMED OR VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WARNING LIGHTS FOR THE ABS AND THE BRAKE.

SMOKE STARTED POURING OUT OF THE VENTS ON THE DRIVERS SIDE OF THE CABIN.  I ROLLED DOWN THE WINDOWS AND THE SUNROOF BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE AIR-CONDITIONING OR HEATER WAS HAVING A PROBLEM. I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND GOT OUT AND WATCHED THE SMOKE FOR A MINUTE. THE SMOKE THEN TURNED A BLACK-DARK GREY COLOR. THEN CAME FLAMES POURING OUT OF THE VENT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE. JUST THEN I HEAR THIS PIERCING SCREECH AND POP, THE CAR WAS COMPLETELY RUINED INSIDE AND SOOT SPEWED EVERYWHERE AROUND THE CAR I THEN TURNED THE HOSE ON WHICH I ALREADY HAD OUT FROM WHEN I WAS GOING TO WASH MY CAR. I PUT  A MAJORITY OF THE FIRE  OUT, SO I WALKED OVER TO MY GARAGE AND GOT A FIRE EXTINGUISHER AND SPRAYED IT ALL OVER TO MAKE SURE IT WAS OUT. I HOSED MY CAR OUT AND AROUND, SURPRISINGLY THE INTERIOR WAS STILL INTACT BUT JUST A TAD BIT DIRTY, SO I TOOK IT TO MY FRIEND WHO OWNS A DEALER/BODY SHOP AND HE GOT THE CAR FIXED AND ITS JUST LIKE NEW AGAIN. HE WAS SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT WIRING AND HEADLIGHTS BUT I WAS JUST HAPPY THAT MY CAR WAS BACK. PLEASE FIX THIS AUDI BECAUSE I WOULD HATE TO SEE SOMEONE GET HURT OVER THIS PROBLEM AND BE LESS FORTUNATE THAN I WAS. OUT OF THE WHOLE MESS I HAD TO GET A NEW DASHBOARD, STEERING WHEEL, WINDSHIELD AND WIRING ALSO A PAINT KIT. THE CAR LOOKS STUNNING I ALSO HAD TO GET IT DETAILED AFTER SO THE TOTAL COST TO REPAIR WAS $1967.34 I LOVE THIS CAR OTHERWISE AND I HOPE THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. *TR",

        "summary": "DEAR GENTLEMEN: THIS IS A CAUSE FOR SERIOUS CONCERN. THE DESIGN OF AUDI A6'S FRONT BUMPER IS FLAWED. IT IS EXTREMELY LOW, AND WHEN YOU PARK THE BOTTOM PART OF THE BUMPER GETS STUCK IN THE CONCRETE SLAB PLACED IN PARKING LOTS. SLOWLY THE BUMPER STARTS TO SEPARATE FROM THE REST OF THE BODY. IF THIS HAPPENS AT NIGHT AND THE DRIVER IS UNAWARE OF THIS, THAT IT COULD FALL OFF, CAUSING A SERIOUS ACCIDENT INVOLVING NOT ONLY THE OWNER OF THE AUDI, BUT THOSE THAT TRAIL BEHIND, WHO MOST CERTAINLY GET HIT BY THE FLYING BUMPER. I HAVE ALREADY BROUGHT MY CAR TWICE TO AUDI FOR THIS PROBLEM, AND ON BOTH OCASSIONS THE COMPANY'S OFFICIAL POSITION IS THAT IT IS THE DRIVER'S FAULT. UNOFFICIALLY (I HAPPEN TO DEAL WITH SOME VERY DECENT FOLKS AT THE COLLECTION, THE LARGEST AUDI DEALERSHIP IN MIAMI)  THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THE FLAW, ITS RECURRENCE WITH OTHER OWNERS, AND CAN'T REALLY DO MUCH ABOUT IT EXCEPT SEND ME TO A REPUTABLE BODY SHOP. LABOR TO FIX THIS RUNS AT AROUND $ 550 PER INCIDENT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THIS IS HAPPENING TO EVERYONE WHO OWNS A 1999 A6. AS A MATTER OF FACT, TODAY THERE WERE THREE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM, AND ONE IN THE BODY SHOP AROUND THE CORNER. THE BODY SHOP OWNER TOLD ME THEY FIX SEVERAL OF THESE EVERY WEEK. OBVIOUSLY THERE HAS GOT TO BE SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH THIS CAR WHEN EVERYONE'S BUMPER GETS RIPPED OFF IN STANDARD PARKING LOTS. OBVIOUSLY THE US DOT OR WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AUTO SAFETY DESIGN HAS NOT DEEMED THIS IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR A RECALL, UNTIL SOMEONE DIES OR SOME SERIOUS ACCIDENT OCCURS IN A MAJOR HIGHWAY IN THIS COUNTRY. I BELIEVE YOU WOULD BE DOING CONSUMERS AND ROAD SAFETY A BIG FAVOR BY INVESTIGATING THIS POTENTIALLY SERIOUS SAFETY MATTER. I TRIED AUDI'S MAIN OFFICE, AND THEY JUST \"WASHED THEIR HANDS\"  SENDING ME TO THE NEAREST BODY SHOP AND TO CHARGE IT TO MY INSURANCE COMPANY. WAY TO GO, AUDI !!!! SINCERELY YOURS, OSCAR CURY.  *AK",
