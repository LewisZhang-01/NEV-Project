Three different mechanic shops (one being a Hyundai dealership) looked at the vehicle and determined that it needed a new engine due to engine knock in lower end of engine.  Car was well maintained and serviced regularly.  Engine light came on intermittently but never stayed on to get a code.  In early January 2022, engine started to have a loud knock and then codes were P0011, P0014, and P0420.  Bank 1 problem, Bank 2 problem, and possible exhaust leak.  Decided to change VVT (or oil control valve) and the old one had silver shavings on it (probably aluminum).  Shavings possibly from piston slapping and causing wear or camshaft bearing wearing.  After reading online I have seen that this has been a common problem with the Hyundai vehicles between years 2015-2017 but the Accent is not on the recall list yet.",
