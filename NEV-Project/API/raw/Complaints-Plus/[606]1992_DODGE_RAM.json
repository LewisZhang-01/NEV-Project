THE WANDERING AND LOOSENESS AND VERY SLOW TO RETURN CONTINUES PLUS AN ADDED PROBLEM NOTED WHEN THEY RETURNED THE VAN, A SCREAMING OF THE STEERING WHEEL. CHECKED THE FLUID AND FOUND IT CONTINUOUSLY LEAKS FROM DAY ONE OF THE VEHICLE RETURNED TO ME.   THE VEHICLE WAS AT THEIR SHOP FOUR TIMES TOTAL.      THIS DEALERSHIP HAS ADAMANTLY REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE STEERING PROBLEM AND DENIES THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ROOF ASSEMBLY.
