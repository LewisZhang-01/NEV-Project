We could have been hit by incoming traffic because of this. It was not until this happened that I found out that there was a class action lawsuit against Nissan due to this CVT problem. My vehicle was not displaying any warning signs, it just stopped accelerating. Nissan failed to notify their consumers about the ongoing issue with the CVT transmission on their vehicles to have the vehicle inspected prior to warranty being expired. I am a single mother, full time employee, and full time student. I purchased this vehicle in hopes of it being reliable. Instead, this malfunction, I was almost hit by incoming traffic because of the lack of communication with their consumers. Letting consumers know this late is ridiculous, considering most of the affected models are close to the end of their 5-year warranty period. I demand an answer from Nissan, I will not accept that they are not doing anything to help me cover the costs which have been estimated to be closer to $10,000 by a Nissan certified service department. Nissan failed to communicate this problem, my daughter and I's safety was compromised when driving this vehicle, what if this would have occurred while we were driving on the highway. I could have been hurt and so would my daughter. I contacted Nissan Consumer Affairs and they declined any sort of help.",

        "summary": "At approximately 68,000 miles and in April 2021, my 2017 Nissan Rogue SL began exhibiting a lag in acceleration from a complete stop. Upon pressing the accelerator, there would be a 3-4 second delay before the engine and rpms would engage and the car would simply crawl forward in that time. I felt the need to try pumping the gas pedal to try to get it to go but that didn't help. After several seconds, it would accelerate and the rpms would go up normally. After doing this three to four times after complete stops, the car goes into \"limp home mode,\" in which it will not shift gears or accelerate above 45 mph. Stopping and turning off the engine, waiting 45-90 seconds, and then restarting almost always resets the car so that it will perform normally again for a little while. But it always recurs, especially if I spend any time idling, such as at a traffic light or in a school pickup line. This is very dangerous, as I am not able to count on my car to get me through traffic when turning onto a road or crossing a road at intersections. I fear being unable to get out of the way of oncoming traffic with that delay in accleration.  The Nissan dealership mechanics have looked at the car for this problem twice and have been unable to resolve the issue at this time. They say it could have something to do with the electrical harness, which is costly to repair and the car is no longer under warranty. The mechanics have been unable to recreate the problem, though it happens frequently in daily use and occurs more often in warm weather than in cool or cold weather. The engine, however, does not register overheating. There is no check engine light when this happens.",

Without a prior indication of a problem from the car's warning system, I suddenly began losing transmission power and experiencing significant engine hesitation while driving yesterday, August 23, 2021. Specifically, the car would hesitate at least 3 seconds and sometimes as long as 8 seconds before engaging, thus putting me in great danger in traffic and on public roads. Additionally, the engine would begin revving up from 1 to 4+ rpms while simply trying to maintain a speed of 40 mph. This caused me to constantly have to remove my foot entirely from the accelerator, further putting me in harm's way while in traffic on both residential and highway roads. I lost control of my vehicle. I immediately proceeded home as carefully as I could manage, stored the vehicle overnight in the garage, and took it to the dealership first thing in the morning. To my great surprise and disappointment, the Nissan adviser informed me that the diagnostic codes received were P0776 and P1715, both of which were addressed in previous Nissan Service Bulletins in both 2018 and 2021. Furthermore, these codes indicate specific issues with the CVT - something that has plagued Nissan for years and continues to be the center of many lawsuits and causes for extended warranty programs. In fact, I experienced CVT transmission failure in a 2015 Nissan Rogue that I owned previous to this one. My sister also experienced the same safety hazard in her Nissan Rogue. This is an ongoing and hugely unsafe problem. Currently, my vehicle is at the dealership, awaiting response from Nissan Corporation as to whether they will replace/fix at no cost, considering the blatant CVT issues and the fact that my powertrain warranty expired less than 5k miles ago and that several other models with the exact same issue have been granted extended warranties, etc. This should be at no expense to me.

        "summary": "It seems the 2017 Nissan Rogue, as well as almost all other years of that make/model have a defect in the drainage system for the sunroof.  The drain lines clog which leads to water accumulating significantly under the floor of the car.  The initial indicator of this is a wet floor, not that big a deal.  However, the water cannot drain at all from under the floorboard so it remains wet, which leads to mold and mildew.  it also can lead to rusting the connections of the front seats with the floor board that quickly rots since it is permanently soaking wet.  The health issues of breathing in moldy air in an enclosed vehicle are significant and the rotting floorboards that can lead to a seat being dislodged are also concerning.  There are numerous examples of this online.  The dealer is aware of the problem but does not believe it is their problem to address.  Nissan and the dealer feel it is a maintenance issue where the car owner must clean out the drain tubes twice a year.  There is nothing in the owners manual indicating this is a requirement or a necessity.  Warranty will not cover it since they feel it is a maintenance issue.",

I took it to my local garage, where I was told the CVT transmission went out and needed replaced. He recommended I speak to Nissan to see if they would help pay for the repair, since it's a common problem, less than 4 years old and only 72,000 miles. Nissan recommended I take it to the nearest dealership so they could diagnose it, then possibly help pay with the goodwill assistance program. I called the dealership and also sent a request for a call back online. I never received a call back. I contacted Nissan's Consumer Affairs department, who said they would contact the dealership. It took the dealership about a week to return my call. When they did, they scheduled an appointment for the following Tuesday. I had the car towed Monday evening and when I hadn't heard back by the end of the week, I called and left a message. They finally called back a week later and said the tests they ran come back to a failed CVT transmission. At that point, Nissan could finally review my case to hopefully offer assistance. Another week later, I received a call that they would not help with the repairs, towing fees or rental car fees. I have had to rent a car for 5 weeks now, because of them dragging their feet. So now I will be out $129 for the diagnostic test, when we already knew the problem, approximately $2,000 for the rental car and over $4,000 for a new transmission. I also would have to pay $5 per mile over 3 miles at 22 miles, so another $95 for towing back to the original garage.",

IT FELT AS THOUGH SEVERAL TIRES HAD BLOWN OUT AT ONCE OR THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION HAD COMPLETELY LOCKED UP.  I REMEMBER HEARING AN AUDIBLE CHIME AND SEEING SOMETHING ON THE CONSOLE PANEL FLASHING WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE RED WARNING LIGHT WHILE I WAS FIGHTING TO RETAIN CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.  WITHIN A PERIOD OF ABOUT 3-5 SECONDS THE WHOLE EVENT WAS OVER AND THE VEHICLE HAD ABRUPTLY SLOWED ITSELF TO THE AFOREMENTIONED SPEED.  FORTUNATELY AT THE TIME THE TRAFFIC WAS LIGHT AND THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER VEHICLE DIRECTLY BEHIND ME OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS EVENT WOULD HAVE ENDED TRAGICALLY.  THE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE IS THAT THIS WAS RELATIVELY OPEN ROAD AT THE TIME AND THERE WERE NO OTHER VEHICLES OR OBSTRUCTIONS IN FRONT OR TO THE SIDES OF THE VEHICLE WHEN THIS OCCURRED. THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN PROMPTLY TURNED OVER TO NISSAN FOR A FULL REVIEW AND REPAIR OF THE FORWARD EMERGENCY BRAKING SYSTEM.",

SEEING THAT THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION, I CONTACTED FALKEN TIRE TO LET THEM KNOW THE SITUATION.  MY FIRST CALL TO THEM CONCLUDED THAT THEY WOULD COVER ALL CHARGES RELATED TO THE TIRE; THE NEW TIRE AND LABOR COST.  WHEN I TOOK MY CAR IN TO GET THOSE TWO TIRES CHANGED, THE GUY HELPING ME CALLED FALKEN TIRE TO MAKE SURE THEY WOULD BE PICKING UP THE BILL AND THEY CLAIMED THEY HAD NOTHING ON FILE REGARDING MY SITUATION.  AFTER MULTIPLE CALLS TO FALKEN TIRE I WAS TOLD THAT THEY CANNOT CHANGE OUT MY TIRES BECAUSE THERE IS NO PROOF IN FRONT OF THEM THAT THESE TIRES ARE FAULTY.  AFTER 2 BLOWN TIRES AND 2 TIRES LEAKING, THEY SAID THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO HELP ME UNTIL AN ACTUAL PROBLEM OCCURS.  WHO IS GOING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IF AN ACCIDENT OCCURS AND PEOPLE ARE BADLY INJURED?  FALKEN TIRE WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR FAULTY TIRES UNTIL SOMEONE DIES FROM THE SITUATION.",

MY SECONDARY COMPLAINT IS HOW THE VEHICLE DRIVES WHILE IN REVERSE.  THE FIRST COMPLAINT, I THINK, MAKES THIS VEHICLE UNSAFE IN A LOT OF DRIVING SITUATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, TO LEAVE MY NEIGHBORHOOD I HAVE TO MAKE A LEFT TURN ONTO A ROAD WITH A BLIND CORNER.  WHEN I AM READY TO GO, I PUT MY FOOT ON THE ACCELERATOR AND SOMETIMES THE VEHICLE REACTS AS I EXPECT AND MAKES THE TURN NO PROBLEM. HOWEVER, ABOUT 75% OF THE TIME, I HIT THE GAS AND THE CAR IDLES FORWARD INTO THE OPPOSING LANE AND ABOUT 1-1.5 SECONDS LATER THE ENGINE CATCHES UP AND ACCELERATES AS EXPECTED. I'VE COME CLOSE TO BEING TBONED IN JUST THIS INTERSECTION AT LEAST 4 TIMES BECAUSE OF THAT DELAY.  ADDITIONALLY, WHILE DRIVING IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC THE CAR WILL OCCASIONALLY LEAP AHEAD NO MATTER IF I'M PRESSING THE GAS OR THE BRAKE. THE INTERFACE BETWEEN GAS AND HYBRID ON THIS VEHICLE IS HORRIBLE, AND NOT LIKE THE ONE I TEST DROVE BEFORE THIS ONE WAS DELIVERED. I FEEL THIS VEHICLE IS SO UNSAFE THAT I DON'T LET MY 16 YEAR OLD DRIVE IT BECAUSE THE DRIVER ALWAYS HAS TO BE ON THEIR TOES FOR THESE ISSUES. I'VE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO ADVANTAGE NISSAN IN BREMERTON, WA TWICE OVER THESE ISSUES AND THEY TELL ME IT'S OPERATING WITHIN NORMAL RANGE AND THIS IS NORMAL. NORMAL OR NOT, ITS UNSAFE. I CAN PROVIDE MANY MORE EXAMPLES OF THIS BEHAVIOR FROM THE VEHICLE, JUST CONTACT ME!  THE SECONDARY ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH HOW THE VEHICLE ACTS WHILE IN REVERSE. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT EXACTLY, BUT WHEN REVERSING AT ANY SPEED THE RIDE IS VERY JERKY, LIKE A PERSON REVERSING IN A MANUAL TRANSMISSION THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE HANG OF THE CLUTCH YET. IT'S WORSE WHEN BACKING DOWN MY STEEP DRIVEWAY, POSSIBLY DUE TO THE HILL ASSIST FEATURE!  PLEASE FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.",

AGAIN, I AM NOT SURE IF THE PAINT IS THIN/CHEAP OR NOT BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT NOT FAIR TO HAVE PAID CLOSE TO $400 EXTRA FOR PREMIUM PAINT AND BE HAVING THIS PROBLEM.  I ALSO HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS AN ISSUE.  FUNNY THAT NO ONE HAS REPORTED IT HERE IN THE PAST.  I GUESS THERE IS A FIRST FOR EVERYTHING.
