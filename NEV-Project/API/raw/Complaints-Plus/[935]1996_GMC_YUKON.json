THE MANUFACTOR WAS NOT WILLING TO PAY TO REPLACE THIS DEFECTIVE PART AT FIRST.  ACCORDING TO THE DEALER THE CARRIER WAS A DEFECTIVE PART FROM THE MANUFACTOR DUE TO A BAD CASTING.  THE VEHICLE WAS JUST 85 DAYS OUTSIDE AN EXTENDED WARRENTY PURCHASED WITH THE TRUCK.  THE DEALER DID BUY A NEW CARRIER AND HAD IT INSTALLED AT A 50/50 COST ON THE LABOR.  I HAD TO BUY THE NEW BEARINGS, HAVE THE AXLES CHECKED FOR TRU-NESS, HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALER, AND FIND ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION FOR A MONTH AT MY EXPENSE.  I WORK FOR THE MANUFACTOR GM IN JANESVILLE WISCONSIN WHERE THE TRUCK WAS BUILT AND THEY DID BACK IN THIS MODEL YEAR HAVE A SHIPMENT OF DEFECTIVE REAR AXLES COME INTO THE PLANT SOME WERE FIXED BECAUSE OF A HOWLING NOISE BEFORE THEY LEFT THE MANUFACTOR, I BELIEVE SOME WERE NOT.

THE FIRE DAMAGED THE LIGHT FIXUTE, THE HEADLINER, AND MY 7-MONTH-OLD SON'S CARSEAT (WHICH HE WAS IN AT THE TIME).  ON 12-29-00, MY HUSBAND TOOK THE YUKON TO TRI-VALLEY GMC.

MADRAZO ON 12-29-00 AND AGAIN ON 1-8-01 THAT THE LIGHT WAS NOT ON, BUT HE SAID THAT GMC WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAMAGES.  WE ARE SURE THE LIGHT WAS NOT ON BECAUSE THAT LIGHT WAS NOT EVEN WORKING.  ON 2-2-98, WE TOOK THE YUKON TO HERRERA GMC (SAME DEALERSHIP, DIFFERENT NAME AND LOCATION) BECAUSE THAT READING LIGHT WOULD STOP WORKING WHEN MOVED IN THE SOCKET.  THEY LOOKED AT THE YUKON AND \"FOUND THE WHITE WIRE FEEDING POWER TO THE READING LIGHT WAS NOT MAKING CONTACT  AT ALL TIMES.\"  THEY \"REMOVED THE LIGHT CONTACT AND STRIPPED THE WIRE BACK AND REINSTALLED.\"  THE LIGHT WORKED FOR ABOUT A YEAR, THEN STOPPED WORKING ALTOGETHER.  WE DID NOT TAKE IT BACK FOR REPAIR BECAUSE THE YUKON WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  ON 1-8-01, MY HUSBAND CONTACTED GM.  HE EXPLAINED THE SITUATION.  ON 1-11-01, MAJA PRUDEN (CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGER) CALLED.  I EXPLAINED THE ENTIRE SITUATION.  SHE ASKED IF THE LIGHT WAS ON, AND I SAID NO.  SHE WANTED ME TO TAKE THE YUKON TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP TO BE LOOKED AT.  I ASKED IF ALL THE DEALERSHIPS IN THE AREA WOULD HAVE THE SAME AREA SERVICE MANAGER, BECAUSE IF SO, THAT WOULD NOT HELP.  ON 1-16-01, MS. PRUDEN CALLED TO SAY THAT SINCE THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE WHO COULD LOOK AT IT, THAT GM WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH MR. WEIGEL'S DETERMINATION",
