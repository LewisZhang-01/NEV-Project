The manufacturer was notified of the failure and advised the contact that the recall history showed that a reinforcement bracket was not installed over the front track bar bracket; therefore, the recall was not completed. The contact stated that he used a strap and tied the front end of the vehicle and then drove to the dealer that was 1.2 miles away. The dealer diagnosed that the front support track bar bracket was fractured. The dealer informed the contact that the recall repair could not be complete because the previous owner had lifted the vehicle.

The EVIC coolant temperature jump rapidly, but I never received a low coolant warning.  I pulled the truck off of I-25 Northbound just south of the WY border.  I waited for the vehicle to cool and added all of the coolant I had on hand, about 1.5 gallons.  I carefully limped into Cheyenne, WY, towing my 40' 5th wheel to a spot where we could stay.    I contacted Cowboy Dodge to identify the problem and repair it.  The technician looked at my vehicle and he indicated the EGR valve was bad and needed replaced.  The repair invoice is attached for reference.  We departed Cheyenne after the fix, and we only got 44 miles out of town on I-80 when the engine coolant light illuminated, and the temp started to spike again.  I coasted down the pass into Laramie, WY, in an attempt to get into cell service range and to get the truck off of the road if possible.  We ended up stranded on I-80 just east of the exit for 4-hours waiting on a tow vehicle that could take us back to Cheyenne, WY, with our RV in tow.  The same technician at Cowboy looked at the truck again and he indicated that the EGR cooler had failed.  The failure allowed coolant to leak, undetected, into the combustion chamber.  This caused carbon deposits, coal-like remnants, to be deposited throughout the motor and it was especially noticeable on the heat exchanger (see attached).    This issue cased $7,000+ damage to my truck and I'm still finding issues related to the failure.  I've had injectors fail, the heater core needed replaced again (3d), and the truck is smoking on startup with diminished power and sputtering at speed.  I've included all Ram 2021 servicing invoices.  This situation could have resulted in a catastrophic runaway on the motor resulting in fire.  I lucked out by watching the gages.  Stellantis (FCA) should be held accountable for their modifications to the Cummins motor causing these issues.",

The front wheels are the ones that are defective on this vehicle, structural cracks form on the outer lip of the wheels, and therefore pose a huge threat to the rim failing violently and the tire losing air or being destroyed in the process. This is the second time a wheel has needed to be replaced because of this issue. This defect has been brought to the attention of both dealership and manufacturer, however neither Dealership nor Manufacture wants to accept responsibility and pay to have the wheel repaired or replaced. Our vehicles are used as commercial vehicles, and are usually towing trailers or heavy loads. Having a front wheel failure during such operations, could pose a huge risk not only to the driver, passengers, and vehicle involved, but also to those surrounding motorist that maybe near or passing by the vehicle during the time of a possible wheel failure. Luckily both cracks have been detected during daily inspections, and none of these issues have resulted in a vehicle accident or injury while vehicle has been traveling down the road. No warning signs were present during the time of repair, and given the fact that the cracks can sometimes be hairline cracks and very hard to notice poses an even bigger threat to those who may not check their wheels on a daily basis, and could very easily be overlooked by the average consumer.",

THIS ENGINE SHOULD BE LASTING BUT FAILED AT 109,082 MILES. THE PROBLEM WITH ACTUATOR FAILED US WAY TOO SOON FOR A RAM CUMMINS DIESEL  WHICH SHOULD GET AT LEAST 300,000 MILES DURABLE WEAR. THIS VEHICLE HAS NEVER BEEN ABUSED IN ANY WAY AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN PROPERLY SERVICED AT AN AUTHORIZED RAM DEALERSHIP. WE CAME HOME FROM VACATION AND TOOK TRUCK TO DEALERSHIP BECAUSE OF DANDER OF LOSING POWER.  WE HAD TO TRAVEL THREE HOURS IN ORDER TO GET HOME FROM VACATION. THEN DO WITHOUT VEHICLE IN ORDER TO HAVE REPAIRED.  THE AUTHORIZED DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN EXCELLENT, WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO COMPLAINT AGAINST THEIR SERVICE. I ACTUALLY SAW SEVERAL ACTUATORS WAITING TO BE RETURNED TO RAM BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN REPLACED. I ASKED WHAT THEY WERE AND I WAS TOLD ACTUATORS THAT HAD BEEN REPLACED WAITING TO BE RETURNED UNDER WARRANTY! WHEN THIS HAPPENED TO US I WAS TOLD 2014 VEHICLES HAD NOT BEEN WARRANTED BY RAM. THE VERY FACT THAT THE ACTUATORS WERE FAILING SPEAKS VOLUMES TO ME BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE PART. AFTER WAITING ONE YEAR FOR RAM TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM IT IS OBVIOUS IT IS BEING IGNORED ON 2014 TRUCKS WHICH HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR POWER AND DURABILITY. IF ONE ACTUATOR GOES BAD THERE IS A RESPONSIBILITY BY RAM TO BACK THEIR PRODUCT. THE CUSTOMER HONORABLY PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE WITH FORETHOUGHT OF ENDURANCE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THE PACKAGE PROVIDED SUITED FOR THE NEED OF PURCHASE. BY THE WAY, THIS IS THE FIRST RAM PURCHASED BY ME!!! WHAT DO YOU THINK????  *TR",

FOR ME, I CAN SOMETIMES DO A 3 COUNT.  THE ISSUE HAPPENS FROM A DEAD STOP OR WHEN YOU ARE CRUISING.  WHEN CRUISING, IT'S EASY TO REPLICATE BECAUSE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IT GIVE IT A LITTLE FUEL, AS IF YOU'RE GOING UP A SMALL HILL, LET OFF, THEN STOMP ON IT...  WHEN THIS IS DONE, THE ENGINE ACTS AS IF YOUR FOOT IS STILL OFF THE PEDDLE FOR WHAT FEELS LIKE ETERNITY.  I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER MULTIPLE TIMES AND EACH TIME, I'M TOLD THIS IS HOW IT'S SUPPOSE TO BE, SO THERE IS NO FIX ... BUT A FLASH MIGHT BE AVAILABLE IN FUTURE TO RESOLVE THIS.
