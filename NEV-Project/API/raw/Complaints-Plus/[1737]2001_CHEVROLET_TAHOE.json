        "summary": "In the past I have sent several emails to Chevrolet corporate office re the ABS brake system on my Tahoe which first failed with only 130 miles on the vehicle.  Vehicle almost tipped over  but I recovered the braking system and stopped vehicle only inches from going off a cliff and into the ravine below.      I love my Tahoe which now has 109000+ miles on it but the ABS brake system has never worked and on several occasions almost wiped out myself and a passenger because brakes failed to engage.  I filed several complaints with the Chevrolet dealer in Austin, TX where I bought my Tahoe and also here in Taos, NM where I currently live.  Recently I had the Chevrolet dealer here in Taos run a diagnostic on my ABS brakes.  Result was that the brake system was defective and would cost $2000 to repair!  I feel Chevrolet should pay for the repair since my Tahoe was delivered from the factory with defective ABS brakes.  As it is, my Tahoe cannot be resold since the system as is could kill anyone in this vehicle if they did not know how to recover when pedal is all the way to the floor and vehicle is picking up speed rather than slowing down.  Certainly even I could hit an elk standing in middle of highway because I would not be able to recover brake system in time.",

THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY RESISTANCE IN THE BRAKE PEDAL AND MINIMAL STOPPING POWER. `HE WAS ABLE TO BRING THE VEHICLE INTO A PARKING GARAGE BY DRIVING SLOWLY AND IN LOW GEAR.

THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN REGISTERED IN MARYLAND SINCE PURCHASED NEW AND THERE IS RELATIVELY LITTLE SNOW THAT FALLS IN THE WINTER AND AS A RESULT THERE IS ALMOST NO OTHER CORROSION ON THIS VEHICLE SO SEEING THE BRAKE LINES CORRODED LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT AN INFERIOR GRADE OF STEEL WAS USED ON THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT.  TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THE BRAKE LINE IN THE AREA OF THE FAILURE IS LOCATED ABOVE THE FRAME AND IS NOT VISIBLE FROM BELOW AND THEREFORE CANNOT BE INSPECTED FOR CORROSION. WHEN THE OIL IS CHANGED AND WHEN THE BRAKES ARE REPLACED THE BRAKE LINES ARE CHECKED BUT IN THE AREA OF THE FAILURE AS STATED THEY CANNOT BE INSPECTED. I BELIEVE GM SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECALL ALL VEHICLES WITH THIS TYPE OF METAL BRAKE LINE AND BE REQUIRED TO REPLACE THEM WITH A BETTER GRADE OF STAINLESS STEEL AS IT IS REASONABLY FORESEEABLE THAT FATALITIES WILL BE THE LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OF THIS TYPE OF FAILURE IN A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THESE INCIDENTS.    *TR",

IN ESCALENTE, I PUT MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND IT WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR. SCARY TO THINK WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED AN HOUR EARLIER WHEN I WAS DRIVING IN THE MOUNTAINS. THE BRAKE LINE RUNNING OVER THE GAS TANK HAD COMPLETELY RUSTED THROUGH.  ALL THE BRAKE AND FUEL LINES WERE SEVERELY RUSTED.  FORTUNATELY, THE ONLY SHOP IN TOWN WAS ABLE TO MAKE UP A REPLACEMENT LINE AND THAT GOT ME HOME. I'M IN THE PROCESS NOW OF REPLACING ALL THE BRAKE AND FUEL LINES.    THIS IS NOT DUE TO NEGLECT.  I WASH AND CLEAN THE UNDERCARRIAGE OFTEN DURING THE WINTER TO REMOVE SALT AND SAND.  I FIRST NOTICED RUST WITHIN A YEAR OF PURCHASING THE CAR IN DECEMBER 2000.  ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO, I HAD MY MECHANIC INSTALL A \"COUNTERACT GSL-2-LC CORROSION CONTROL SYSTEM\".  THE RUST CONTINUED TO WORSEN    THIS FAILURE COULD HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC!  I'M GETTING MY LINES REPLACED BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER TAHOES EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM?  *TT",

I CALLED AAA TO HAVE THE TIRE CHANGED AND WHEN THE TECHNICIAN ARRIVED HE CHECK THE AIR PRESSURE WHICH WAS 37 LBS.  MY SPARE WAS PLACED ON MY VEHICLE AND I DROVE HOME.  I CONTACTED AMERICAS TIRE CO.

I WAS SENT A CLAIM PACKAGE AND WAS TOLD TO MAIL THE TIRE BACK FOR INSPECTION. ON JULY 10 I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM WHICH STATED OUR CLAIM WAS DENIED.  THE REASONS WHERE BECAUSE OUR TIRE HAD A LOOSE PATCH PLUG REPAIR AND WAS UNDERINFLATED.  THEY ARE SAYING DUE TO THE PUNCTURE, WHICH THERE ISN'T ONE BECAUSE IT WAS REPAIRED IN 2006,  THE TIRE FAILED.  I CALLED AMERICAS TIRE AND TOLD THEM WHAT CRAWFORD HAD SAID ABOUT THE REPAIR AND THEY TOLD ME THAT  THEY FOLLOW CALIF. LAW WHEN DOING A TIRE REPAIR. I WAS ALSO TOLD THE PATCH WOULD NOT CAUSE A SEPARATION OF THE TREAD, THAT IS CAUSED BY A COMPANY DEFECT.   CRAWFORD CLAIMS THAT THEY TESTED THE TIRE AND REFUSE TO PROVIDE ME WITH ANY INFORMATION.  MY TIRE WAS REPAIRED IN OCT. OF 2006,  IF THIS WAS THE CASE MY TREAD WOULD HAVE SEPARATED A LONG TIME AGO.  IT APPEARS CRAWFORD IS USING THIS AS AN EXCUSE NOT TO PAY THE OVER $2,000 WORTH OF DAMAGE TO MY CAR.  CRAWFORD CLAIMS WHEN A FLAT TIRE IS REPAIRED WITH A PATCH IT AFFECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE TIRE.  THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN AN EXCUSE FOR CRAWFORD AND COOPER TO NOT PAY FOR THE DAMAGED TO MY CAR. I ALSO HAVE NOTICED THAT PRO COMP HAS HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE SAME STYLE  ALL TERRAIN TIRE NO.

I HAVE SINCE HEARD \"THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE\"  THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE CHEVY TAHOE.  WHEN THE SERVICE DEPART. AT MY LOCAL CHEVY DEALER ORDERED THE NEW GLASS, BY COMPUTER, THE PART # CHANGED MANY TIMES, AS IF MANY CHANGES HAD BEEN MADE AND EVENTUALLY THE PART (GLASS) HAD TO COME DIRECTLY FROM THE GLASS MANUFACTURER.  OBVIOUSLY GM IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM.  MY CONCERN IS THAT HAD ONE OF MY CHILDREN, OR EVEN MYSELF WITH NOT AS MUCH STRENGTH AS MY HUSBAND OPENED THE GLASS ON THE HATCH,WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CATCH AND HOLD THE END WITH THE BROKEN HINGE RESULTING IN THE REMAINING HINGE \"TEARING\" AND THERE COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUS INJURY.  MY TAHOE IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY SO I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 700.00  BILL  THAT I TRULY FEEL GM SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AS THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  *JB",

NORMAL DRIVING HEATS THE REAR BRAKE DISC REPEATEDLY.

I WAS TOLD THAT HE HAD SEEN A LOT OF THEM RECENTLY AND THAT HE WOULD LET ME TAKE THE TRUCK BACK TO THE DEALER TO GET IT FIXED.  HE SAID THE OTHER 5-6 THAT HE HAD SEEN VERY RECENTLY HAD TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER BECAUSE IT WAS A RECALLED PART AND THEY FIXED IT FOR FREE.  UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN I TOOK IT TO MY DEALER, HE INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS NOT A RECALLED PART AND WOULD NOT BE COVERED -- IN FACT, WOULD COST ME $200-$300 TO FIX.  HE SAID THAT SIX MONTHS AGO, WHEN HE INSPECTED THE CAR, IT WAS FINE.  SO, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS, MY PARKING BRAKE HAD GONE BAD.

HOWEVER, CHEVROLET/GM DOES NOT AGREE (PLEASE SEE EMAIL TRAFFIC).  I FEEL THAT THIS \"CARBON BUILDUP\" IS A KNOWN DEFECT AND A SAFETY ISSUE - NOT A NORMAL  EMISSIONS OPERATION.

WE DID CONTACT GUNN CHEVROLET AND SPOKE WITH SERVICE MANAGER, STEPHANIE   ROCHA. MS. ROCHA ADVISED US THAT IN THE OWNERS MANUAL, UNDER THE   SECTION OF MAINTENANCE SERVICES, IT SPECIFICALLY STATES AT 15,000 MILES THAT   THE VEHICLE MAY REQUIRE EMISSIONS SERVICE AND THEN POSSIBLY AGAIN AT   30,000 MILES. MS. ROCHAS STATES THAT THE STICKING PEDAL IS DUE TO CARBON   BUILD UP FROM GASOLINE AND IS DEEMED NORMAL MAINTENANCE AND IS PART OF   THE EMISSIONS SERVICE. MAINTENANCE IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE   CUSTOMER. WE APOLOGIZE FOR ANY DISSATISFACTION THIS MAY HAVE CAUSED.    IF YOU SHOULD NEED TO CONTACT US IN THE FUTURE, SIMPLY REPLY TO THIS   MESSAGE OR CALL OUR CHEVROLET CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CENTER AT   1-800-222-1020.  PLEASE REFERENCE FILE NUMBER 1-108448392.
