Now it has caused an accident. How are you not doing anything when this has CAUSED DEATHS!!! here is a link to a blog that shows many bmw x3 owners have the problem - some have had their cars replaced by bmw and others have been ignored. this is a serious safety issue that is being ignored by the manufacturer (similar to the toyota issue). please investigate before someone gets killed. http://www.bimmerfest.com/forums/showthread.php?t=262130.",

People are telling you their family members are injured and/or dying because 2008 BMW X3\u2019s simply loose power at 70mph and transmission issues that make this care not accelerate, jerk, stall, etc. I have been helping contact other owners    in an effort to see if they have any unreported issues and many say their complaints were also ignored. when you try to accelerate, the transmission \"thinks\" about what gear it should be in. the vehicle hesitates, stalls slightly, and creeps along slowly before second gear catches. the rpms are erratic when accelerating. very unpredictable when trying to accelerate. the hesitation is the main issue, especially when trying to pull out of an intersection across traffic. it can become a very scary situation when you want to accelerate and nothing happens. this is an ongoing problem. nothing in particular causes it to happen besides regular acceleration. the problem is intermittent and may disappear while driving. however, it will appear again for no real reason. a software update was performed in mid-july. the problem was still noticeable. on august 3rd, the vehicle was once again brought in for service work. the service manager came along for the drive and noticed the transmission problem. another 2008 bmw x3 that was on the lot was driven under the same driving conditions. the same issues with the transmission were noted. he told me that they will contact bmw to see if there are any service bulletins on how to correct the problem, but was unaware of any fix currently available. after two service calls the problem still persists without any fix as of yet.",

I LOOKED DOWN AND NOTICED MY COAT ON FIRE. I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER AND TURNED THE CAR OFF.  I GOT OUT, FRANTICALLY PATTED MY COAT THAT WAS BURNING, AND LOOKED AT MY SEAT TO SEE IF THERE WAS A FIRE AND THERE WAS A HOLE WHERE THE HEATER HAD BURNED COMPLETELY THRU THE LEATHER SEAT. I GOT BACK IN, DIDN'T TURN THE HEATER ON, AND WHEN I ARRIVED HOME I DIDN'T DRIVE UNTIL THAT MONDAY, DECEMBER 21, 2020 I DROVE TO MY LOCAL BMW DEALERSHIP THAT REGULARLY SERVICES MY VEHICLE AND EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED AND ASKED IF THERE WAS A KNOWN RECALL OR ISSUES.  HE EXPLAINED IT WAS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THE HEATER SYSTEM IN THE SEATS FAILING AND CAUSING DAMAGE BUT CURRENTLY NO RECALLS FOR THE ISSUE. I ASKED HOW COULD THAT BE WITH THE DANGER INVOLVED?  I EXPLAINED IT COULD HAVE BEEN TRAGICALLY WORSE IF I HAD CAUGHT FIRE AND COULDN'T GET IT OUT. I WAS LUCKY I FELT IT QUICKLY AND WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER AND  GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE.  CHRIS AT CAIN BMW, NORTH CANTON, OHIO INSPECTED MU VEHICLE AND GAVE ME AN ESTIMATE OF $1,495.00 TO REPLACE THE PART OF MY SEAT AFFECTED WITH A NEW HEATING SYSTEM AND REPAIR.

BMW WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE CAR SITTING SO LONG AND I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE. IT IS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF DAMAGE ON A CAR THAT WAS PERFECTLY SAFELY DRIVABLE BEFORE I PARKED IT TO WAIT FOR AN AIRBAG.

THE TRANSMISSION WOULD NOT RESPOND WHEN DEPRESSING THE ACCELERATOR AT RANDOM TIMES.

THIS WAS SO SERIOUS THAT BMW RECOGNIZED IT AS A PROBLEM BUT COULD NOT FIX IT DESPITE REPLACING MAJOR TRANSMISSION PARTS. THEY ASSURED ME IT WAS NOT A GENERAL PROBLEM IN X3'S SO I ALLOWED THEM TO REPLACE THE 2008 X3 WITH A 2009 MODEL. LESS THAN 1000 MILES AND ONE MONTH LATER THE 2009 STARTED EXHIBITING THE SAME PROBLEMS. THIS TIME BMW WOULD NOT REMEDY THE SITUATION INSTEAD DENYING THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE CAR. THE MATTER IS CURRENTLY WITH MY  LEMON LAW LAWYERS AND BMW. HERE IS A LINK TO A BLOG THAT SHOWS MANY BMW X3 OWNERS HAVE THE PROBLEM - SOME HAVE HAD THEIR CARS REPLACED BY BMW AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN IGNORED. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT IS BEING IGNORED BY THE MANUFACTURER (SIMILAR TO THE TOYOTA ISSUE). PLEASE INVESTIGATE BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED.

THE CAR HAD A SERIOUS MANUFACTURERS DEFECT THAT CAUSED AN ELECTRICAL FIRE AND RESULTED IN MY CAR BEING TOTALED. I HAD MULTIPLE ISSUES WITH THE FRONT PASSENGERS SIDE FOG LIGHT FALLING OUT OF ITS CASING INTO THE LOWER CORNER OF THE BUMPER WHICH CAUSED THREE SEPARATE FIRES. BMW HAS REFUSED TO REPLACE MY VEHICLE THAT HAD 11,500 MILES AND IS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.    AT THE END OF JUNE 2008 I FIRST REALIZED THIS PROBLEM HAPPENED UPON A CLOSER INSPECTION OF THE EXTERIOR OF THE CAR. I BROUGHT THE CAR RIGHT AWAY TO SONNEN BMW'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT, AS I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE. I SHOWED THEM WHAT HAPPENED, BUT THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD NO AVAILABLE APPOINTMENTS UNTIL TWO WEEKS OUT AND THAT MY CAR WAS SAFE TO DRIVE. TWO WEEKS LATER I BROUGHT MY VEHICLE TO SONNEN'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT, THEY \"VERIFIED THE DEFECT\" AS STATED IN THEIR SERVICE RECORDS. THEY REPLACED THE COMPLETE FRONT BUMPER AND SUPPOSEDLY RE SECURED THE FOGLIGHT. ALL OF THIS WAS COVERED UNDER BMW'S WARRANTY AS IT WAS A MANUFACTURES DEFECT. I ASKED TOM MURTHA (MY SERVICE ADVISOR) WHY THIS HAD HAPPENED, HE TOLD THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO IMPACT DAMAGE, THE ONLY WAY THIS COULD HAVE OCCURRED WAS A MISTAKE WHEN BUILDING THE VEHICLE AT THE FACTORY.    I THOUGHT ALL OF MY PROBLEMS WERE SOLVED UNTIL A FOGGY DAY IN SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA. ON OCTOBER 25TH, 2008 AT APPROXIMATELY 4:00 PM. WHILE WAITING AT A STOPLIGHT I TURNED ON MY FOG LIGHTS AT THE INTERSECTION OF FRONT & BROADWAY (ASSUMING THAT THE FOGLIGHT HAD BEEN SECURED). IT WAS FOGGY OUT AND MY PASSENGER AND I COULD NOT SEE THE SMOKE THAT WAS COMING FROM THE PASSENGER SIDE FOG LIGHT BECAUSE OF A SMALL FIRE IT CAUSED. I WAS MADE AWARE OF THIS WHEN A PEDESTRIAN WALKED UP TO MY CAR AND ALERTED ME THAT THERE WAS A FIRE. I PULLED OVER RIGHT AWAY AND I DUMPED THE CONTENTS OF A LARGE WATER BOTTLE ON THE FLAME. *TR",
