PARTS WERE REPLACED THAT DIDN'T CORRECT THE PROBLEM OF THE TICKING ENGINE, COOLANT LEAKS, SMELL OF COOLANT  INSIDE CAR,AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WHICH ALWAYS COMES ON A COUPLE OF HOURS AFTER THE DEALER RETURNS MY CAR TO ME.  CAR  WAS TOWED FROM FREEWAY DUE  TO BREAKDOWN ON THE WAY HOME 15 MINUTES AFTER PICKING CAR UP FROM MADISON DEALERSHIP FOR ENGINE REPAIR.

I DID NOT HAVE MY CAR FOR A TOTAL OF 30 DAYS NOT INCLUDING THE  PRIOR VISITS  WHERE THEY TOOK ALMOST 2 WEEKS TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.  I WAS CHARGED FOR A RENTAL CAR DURING THIS PERIOD.  MILWAUKEE DEALERSHIP CLAIMED THEY CORRECTED THE ENGINE PROBLEM ON 3 DIFFERENT VISITS WHICH I PAID $600.00 FOR A TIMING BELT WHICH NEVER CORRECTED THE PROBLEM ALONG WITH A $100.00 DEDUCTIBLE FOR USING THE WARRANTY.  THE PARTS REPLACED ON THE VEHICLE IS AS FOLLOWS;  MANIFOLD ASSY. MOTOR ASSY FOR WIPER BLADES,WINDOW REGULATOR,TIMING BELT AND DIFFERENTIAL FRONT MOUNTING WHICH DID NOT RESOLVE RATTLING NOISE UNDERNEATH CAR.
