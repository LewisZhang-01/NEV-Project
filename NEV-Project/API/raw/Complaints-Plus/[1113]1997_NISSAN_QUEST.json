I HAVE PUT $4500 WORTH OF WORK INTO THE VEHICLE ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT IT WAS A $122 PART THAT SUPPOSEDLY NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. I HAVE SPOKEN TO OTHER NISSAN OWNERS (MANY WITH OTHER NISSAN VEHICLES-NOT PATHFINDERS) AND THEY TOO HAVE HAD THIS SAME EXPERIENCE WITH THEIR VEHICLE. THE PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH ANYBODY EXCEPT THE NISSAN DEALERSHIPS WHICH MEANS THERE IS NO WAY TO GET A COMPETATIVE PRICE. IN ORDER TO GET THE LIGHT TO SHUT OFF ONCE MY MECHANIC HAS REPLACED THE PARTS I WILL THEN BE FORCED TO TAKE THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP TO PAY THEM TO SHUT IT OFF. I WAS INFORMED BY THE MECHANIC AT THE DEALERSHIP THAT THIS PROBLEM WOULD NOT EFFECT THE DRIVABILITY OF THE VEHICLE THAT IT WAS AN EMISSIONS SITUATION.

THE WINDSHIELD WASHERS DID NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY AND IT WAS MONSOON SEASON. THE SWITCH FOR POWER WINDOWS WAS NOT WORKING, I HAD A BRAKE LIGHT OUT, NO SUN VISOR, AND NO DASH LIGHTS TO ILLUMINATE MY GAUGE CLUSTER AT NIGHT. ALL WITHIN 16 HOURS AND 15.5 OF THOSE HOURS IT WAS SITTING IN MY DRIVEWAY NOT EVEN BEING USED. I DROVE IT 5 MINUTES DOWN THE ROAD WHEN I BOUGHT IT AND THEN 8 MINUTES TO THE CHURCH THE FOLLOWING MORNING, AND THEN 15 MINUTES BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP TO REPORT THE PROBLEMS. I ASKED FOR MY TRADE IN BACK AND THEY REFUSED. THEY PLACED MY QUEST IN THE SHOP AND LEFT IT THERE FOR 10 DAYS. OF WHICH 2 OF THOSE DAYS THEY DID NOT EVEN GIVE ME A LOANER CAR KNOWING THAT THE QUEST WAS MY ONLY VEHICLE FOR ME AND MY HUSBAND TO GO TO AND FROM WORK AND TAKE MY DAUGHTER TO SCHOOL EVERYDAY 20 MILES AWAY. THEY CONTACTED ME AND LET ME KNOW THE CAR WAS READY AND HAD NO PROBLEMS AND WITHIN 5 SECONDS OF TURNING ON THE CAR AND DRIVING JUST A FEW FEET I KNEW THE CAR HAD NOT BEEN FIXED IT WAS MALFUNCTIONING THE SAME WAY. I ASKED THEM TO REFIX AND THEY TOLD ME THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. I THEN DEMANDED TO SEE THE OWNER AND ASKED YET AGAIN FOR MY TRADE IN BACK THIS WAS NOW THE THIRD TIME ASKING FOR IT OR MY MONEY.  I MET THE OWNER SOME DAYS LATER. HE TOLD ME I COULD KEEP THE QUEST OR HE WOULD PUT ME IN A NEW CAR. HE NEVER GAVE ME A CHOICE JUST THREW ANOTHER VEHICLE AT ME AND EVEN CHARGED ME MORE MONEY TO DO IT. I HATE THE NEW VEHICLE AND WILL NOT DRIVE IT NOT TO MENTION I AM FEARFUL OF MY SAFETY AS I DO NOT TRUST THIS DEALERSHIP NOR THEIR VEHICLES ANYMORE. I JUST WANT MY OLD CAR BACK OR MY MONEY AND NEVER SEE THIS DEALERSHIP AGAIN. I HOPE YOU POST THIS LOUD AND CLEAR.",

I JUST GOT 60,000 MILES MAINTENANCE SERVICE WITH WONDRIES NISSAN IN THIS FEBRUARY AND THEY SHOULD FIND SOMETHING WRONG.  2. THIS IS UNNORMAL AND VERY DANGEROUS INCIDENT.
