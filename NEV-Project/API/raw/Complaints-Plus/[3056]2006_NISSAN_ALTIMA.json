She then stated that the vehicle independently lurched forward through a fence and rolled down a hill and into a five-lane road. The air bags did not deploy during the incident. A police report was not filed and the contact was injured. With the assistance of a fellow motorist, the contact was able to move the vehicle to a nearby independent mechanic. The mechanic attempted to jumpstart the vehicle but the vehicle failed to start up. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and was given a case number. The contact also spoke with three dealers (Dealers unknown) and they each offered no assistance.  The vehicle had yet to be repaired and remained in the possession of the mechanic.

I CAN NOT REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST NOTICED IT BUT IT WOULD BE ABOUT 5 YEARS AGO EASILY. ALSO THE EXTERIOR PAINT ON MY CAR HAS PREMATURELY DEGRADED TO THE POINT WHERE I ALMOST HAVE NO CLEAR COAT LEFT ON MY CAR. THE MAIN ISSUE IS THE RUST. I HAVE NEVER HAD A CAR RUST IN A FLAT PART UNDER NEATH A CAR WHERE WATER SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SIT. I WILL BE ATTACHING PICTURES THAT SHOW THE EXTENT OF THE ISSUE. I HAVE ALSO COME ACROSS NUMEROUS CHAT PAGES THAT HAVE THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENING TO THEIR CARS AS WELL. THIS IS AN OBVIOUS SAFETY HAZARD THAT CAN NOT POSSIBLY BE MEETING THE MINIMUM SAFETY STANDARDS. I DO LIVE IN A COLD WEATHER STATE NOW BUT THE RUSTING HAPPENED WHILE I WAS STILL LIVING IN SOUTH CAROLINA. THE FIXES FOR THIS ISSUE ARE EXPENSIVE AND SHOULD NOT BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONSUMER TO FIX WHEN IT IS A COMMON ISSUE FOR 2002-2006 ALTIMA SERIES. NOT ONLY DO THESE RUST SPOTS ALLOW FOR DEBRIS TO POSSIBLE COME INTO THE CABIN FROM THE UNDERSIDE OF THE VEHICLE BUT ALSO ALLOW FOR EXHAUST TO FILL THE CABIN. KOBE STEEL IS A KNOW SUPPLIER FOR NISSAN AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THEY SUPPLIED THE FLOOR PANELS FOR THESE YEAR OF ALTIMA'S SINCE THEY HAVE ADMITTED TO USING MATERIAL THAT IS NOT UP TO STANDARDS. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE FLOORBOARDS FIXED WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY OR SOMETHING TO MAKE THIS SITUATION RIGHT. MY CAR CURRENTLY WITH THE RUST AND PAINT ISSUES IS UN-SELLABLE AND HAS LOST 100% OF ITS VALUE.  THANK YOU FOR REVIEWING THIS COMPLAINT. AGAIN THE EXACT START TIME FOR THE RUST OR THE PAINT IS UNKNOWN BUT IT STARTED AROUND 5 YEARS AGO.",

I WAS WAITING ON THE SIGNAL TO TURN LEFT WHEN MY CAR FIRST SHUT OFF ON ME WITHOUT ANY WARNING OR SIGNS. I TURNED OFF MY IGNITION AND TRIED TO START MY CAR, IT STARTED AND I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE HOME. NEXT MORNING, I LEFT MY HOME FOR GROCERY AND I WAS DRIVING ON THE SIDE STREET AND MY CAR SHUT OFF ON ME AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME MY CAR WAS MOVING ON A TWO WAY STREET AND LUCKILY NO CAR WAS BEHIND ME. ALSO, ALL LIGHTS TURNED ON THIS TIME IN MY DASHBOARD AND THE SERVICE ENGINE SOON LIGHT STAYED ON. I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION SWITCH AND TURNED IT BACK ON, I GOT PANICED BUT THIS TIME MY CAR STARTED AFTER MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE TO THE GROCERY STORE TO DO MY GROCERIES AND WHEN I WAS READY TO LEAVE AFTER AN HOUR FROM THE STORE, MY CAR DID NOT WANT TO START. NOW, I BECAME MORE CONCERNED AND FINALLY WHEN MY CAR STARTED, I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT TO NEAREST OREILLY'S ON MY WAY HOME TO GET IT CHECKED. THEY TESTED MY BATTERY, ALTERNATOR AND STARTER AND TOLD ME THAT ALL OF THEM WERE WORKING FINE BUT THE COMPUTER IS READING THE CODE P0340 WHICH REPRESENTS THE CAMSHAFT CENSOR IN THE VEHICLE. AFTER GETTING MY VEHICLE TESTED AND RECEIVING THE RESULTS, ON MY WAY HOME IT TUNED OFF ON ME TWICE AGAIN AT THE SIGNALS. AFTER DOING MY RESEARCH I NOTICED THAT NISSAN HAD A RECALL FOR POTENTIAL DEFECTIVE CAMSHAFT CENSORS ON 653,910 UNITS UNDER NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 07V-527. I CALLED THE NISSAN 1-800-647-7261 NUMBER AND THEY TOLD ME THAT MY CAR DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR A FREE REMEDY EVEN THOUGH THE SYMPTOMS FALLS UNDER THE SAME EQUIPMENT/PART RECALL. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I AM UNABLE TO DRIVE MY CAR SINCE THEN.     PLEASE CONSIDER MY COMPLAINT REGARDING THIS SERIOUS CONCERN AND ADVISE A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE.

THIS CAR IS JUST 10 YEARS OLD AND THE REST OF THE BODY IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION WITH LITTLE TO NO RUST.  I LIVE IN A SALT BELT STATE BUT OTHER CARS OF THE SAME AGE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE THIS SAME PROBLEM.  I'VE LEARNED THROUGH MEDIA AND WEB THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH 2002 - 2006 NISSAN ALTIMAS.

THE ISSUE IS INCREASINGLY GETTING WORSE. NISSAN SHOULD HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND PAY FOR THEIR ISSUE, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS EFFECTING HUNDREDS OF CUSTOMERS. I HAVE A WARRANTY BUT THEY REFUSE TO HELP ME UNLESS MY TRANSMISSION IS IN PIECES ON THE MECHANICS FLOOR SO THEY CAN LOOK AT IT. THE WARRANTY COMPANY SAYS IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO FIND THE MECHANIC, AUTHORIZE THE TEAR DOWN, AND THEN OF COURSE PAY THE BILL IF THEY REFUSE TO FIX IT. THIS ISSUE IS NOT MY FAULT AND I SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED FOR SOMETHING I DID NOT DO. I CHOSE NISSAN EXPECTING QUALITY AND SO THAT IS NOT WHAT I HAVE RECEIVED. I PAID MY CAR OFF IN A YEAR (AND IT WASN'T CHEAP!) SO I CANNOT JUST GO TRADE IT IN, AND I DO NOT HAVE MONEY TO PAY ANOTHER CAR NOTE. I EXPECTED AT LEAST 10 YEARS OUT OF THE CAR, AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET FAR MORE THAN 10 YEARS OUT OF IT. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. MY CAR IS BREAKING DOWN IN FRONT OF MY EYES WITH LESS THAN 115,000 MILES ON IT AND THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A QUALITY CAR. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE THE ONE TO PAY THESE REPAIRS. WE ARE VICTIMS AND WE DESERVE TO BE COMPENSATED, NOT BE PUNISHED.",

I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP TO WHICH THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT IN WHEN THE PROBLEM WAS ACTUALLY OCCURRING, WHICH WAS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE SINCE IT WAS SPORADIC. I HAVE NOTICED THAT DURING WINTER ON OCCASION THE CLUTCH AND BRAKES WOULD NEED TO BE PUMPED BEFORE DRIVING OTHERWISE THE CLUTCH WOULD STICK AND THE BRAKES JUST WOULDN'T WORK. THIS MORNING I GOT IN MY NISSAN WHICH HAD BEEN PARKING IN THE GARAGE ALL NIGHT, AND THE CLUTCH PETAL WAS SUNK TO THE FLOOR. I WAS ABLE TO TURN THE CAR ON, BUT COULDN'T SWITCH GEARS. I TRIED PULLING UP ON THE CLUTCH PETAL WITH MY FOOT AND NOTHING. IT TOOK MULTIPLE TIMES OF TRYING TO PICK IT UP WITH MY FOOT AND TRYING TO UN-STICK IT BY PRESSING DOWN HARD ON IT BEFORE IT FINALLY CAME UP AND I WAS ABLE TO PUT IT IN REVERSE TO DRIVE. *TR",

THE SOLUTION WAS TO CATCH THE CLUTCH WITH THE DRIVER'S TOE AND RAISE IT MANUALLY BACK INTO POSITION EACH TIME  PRIOR TO A SHIFT.  THIS IS DIFFICULT, DISTRACTING, AND DANGEROUS AND COULD EASILY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  I REPORTED IT TO MY DEALERSHIP BUT THEY WERE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE IT AND THEREFORE DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.

IT SMELL AS IF THE ENGINE WAS BURNING.  (ODO 13,791).  IT WAS TOWED TO THE NEAREST NISSAN DEALERSHIP.  THEY SAID THE IT THREW A ROD AND THERE IS A HOLE THE SIZE OF A FIST IN THE ENGINE.

THE SERVICE MANAGER ASSURED ME THAT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WOULD RUN A SERIES OF TEST AND IT SHOULDN'T TAKE LONGER THAN A DAY TO FINISH.  AS A RESULT I BROUGHT MY CAR IN ON A MONDAY MORNING, AND GUESS WHAT?  IT'S STILL THERE.  IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS.  END OF THE FIRST DAY, HE TOLD ME IT'S A HUGE RECALL AND A LOT OF TEST NEEDS TO BE RUN. [HE COULDN'T TOLD ME THAT DURING THE TIME I BROUGHT IT IN SO NISSAN CAN GIVE ME RENTAL CAR FOR MY TROUBLE.]  SINCE THE TIMING WAS BAD, I COULDN'T GET A RENTAL CAR.  AT THE END OF THE SECOND DAY, THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THE TESTING WAS DONE SUCCESSFULLY, BUT WHEN THEY TRIED TO REPROGRAM THE ECM IT IS NOT WORKING.  [AGAIN, IT'S TOWARD THE END OF THE DAY, I COULD NOT MAKE IT IN TIME TO GET A RENTAL CAR]  NOW, IT'S THE 3RD DAY, AND THEY SAID THEY WILL CALL ME BACK TO GIVE ME AN UPDATE AS SOON AS THEY FIND OUT WHAT IS THE STATUS OF MY VEHICLE.  WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY WILL TELL ME NEXT.  I AM CONCERN FOR MYSELF AND OTHER CONSUMERS WHO HAD BROUGHT THEIR CAR IN FOR THE RECALL ENGINE INSPECTION.  I AM PRETTY SURE THEY PROMISE EVERY 2006 NISSAN OWNER THAT IT WOULD TAKE A DAY TO ACCOMPLISH THE TEST, BUT IT'S BEEN 3 LONG INCONVENIENT DAYS FOR ME AS A NISSAN OWNER.  WONDRIES NISSAN IS NOT TOO ATTENTIVE TO MY CONCERNS AND MY DAILY WORK SCHEDULE.  I HOPE SOMEONE FROM NHTSA CAN LOOK INTO THIS MATTER AND CHECK WHY IT WOULD TAKE THEM MORE   THAN 2 DAYS TO PERFORM TESTS ON THEIR [CLAIMED] NATIONAL RECALL.

WE DID AND SERVICE MANAGER SAID IT WAS DEFINITELY USING OIL AND HE WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE ENGINE.  THAT WAS ABOUT THE TIME THE RECALL CAME OUT IN THE NEWSPAPER.  WE ARE STILL WAITING ON OUR ENGINE.  HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THIS  SINCE ABOUT MARCH.  MY HUSBAND WAS TOLD BY SERVICE DEPT THAT NISSAN HAD CHANGED RING MANUFACTURERS AND HAD RECEIVED A FAULTY BATCH.  I AM TIRED OF GOING TO NISSAN EVERY 700 MILES TO HAVE MY OIL CHECKED.  THAT IS WHY I BOUGHT A NEW CAR!!!  WE REQUESTED A NEW CAR, BUT LIKE ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE WITH COMPLAINTS, THEY JUST LAUGHED.  I GUESS IT IS GOING TO TAKE SOMEONE GETTING KILLED IN A FIRE FOR THEM TO GET OFF OF THE REARS AND ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING!!  I AM TIRED OF HEARING WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO YET!!  *JB",

OUR SALESPERSON TOLD US THEN THAT NISSAN WAS HAVING A DEALER CONTEST FOR ALTIMA'S. AT THE SAME TIME, NISSAN WAS VERY HEAVILY ADVERTISING ON TV A \"SPECIAL\" LEASE PRICE FOR THE ATLIMA'S.  2 WEEKS LATER, BEFORE RECEIVING ANY LETTER FROM NISSAN, A COLLEAGUE SENT ME THE LINK FOR THE DETROIT FREE PRESS, SO THAT I COULD READ THE ARTICLE ABOUT NISSAN ALTIMA'S BEING PULLED FROM THE MARKET BECAUSE OF OIL PROBLEMS, WHICH WERE POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS.  I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT I WAS DEFRAUDED BY NISSAN (AND PERHAPS THE DEALER) BY THIS SALE.  NO ONE CAN MAKE ME BELIEVE THAT NISSAN DIDN'T DO THIS CONTEST ON PURPOSE IN ORDER TO MOVE AS MANY CARS AS POSSIBLE OFF THE DEALER LOTS.  THE 200+ INCIDENCES OF OIL PROBLEMS AND THE LESSER INCIDENCES OF FIRES DID NOT ALL OCCUR WITHIN THE TWO WEEKS BETWEEN THE TIME I BOUGHT MY CAR AND SALES WERE HALTED.    I HAVE ALREADY HAD ONE OCCURRENCE WHERE I HAD TO ADD OIL.  I THEN HAD TO WAIT 4 DAYS FOR THE DEALER TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE CAR.  IRONICALLY, WHEN THE CAR WAS RETURNED THE PAPERWORK DID NOT SHOW ANY RECORD OF MY ADDING OIL (EVEN THOUGH I TOLD 3 SEPARATE PEOPLE AT THE DEALERSHIP).  IT DID SAY THAT THE DEALER DID NOT HAVE TO ADD OIL.     I DRIVE THIS CAR EVERY DAY BACK AND FORTH TO WORK.  TO MATTERS WORSE,  I ALSO TRANSPORT MY HUSBAND, WHO IS RECOVERING FROM A 5-ORGAN TRANSPLANT, TO HIS DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS TWICE A WEEK, WHICH ARE OVER AN HOUR AWAY.

WHAT WAS TOLD TO US BY WENDY WAS THAT THEY COULD ONLY OFFER US A TRADE IN PRICE ON A BRAND NEW VEHICLE WITH ONLY 755 MILES WHICH TO DATE HAS USED 1 QUART OF OIL.  FURTHER TALKING WITH WENDY THIS MORNING, SHE DIVULGED THAT POWER NISSAN TEMPE HAS PULLED ALL OF THE NISSAN ALTIMA CARS WITH THE 4 CYLINDER ENGINE. THEREFORE, THIS ACTION WARRANTS THAT THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THIS MAKE AND MODEL OF THE NISSAN ALTIMA!!!

I WAS NOT PERMITTED TO RETURN THE VEHICLE.  I CHECKED MY OIL AFTER 580 MILES DRIVEN AND IT IS ALREADY DOWN TWO QUARTS. THE DEALER MUST HAVE KNOWN OF REPORTED PROBLEMS.  *NM",

ON DECEMBER 30, 2005 AT APPROXIMATELY 11:54 AM WHILE EXITING HIGHWAY 59 SOUTH ON THE RAMP TO BELTWAY 8 NORTH IN HOUSTON, TEXAS THE STEERING WHEEL FAILED TO PERFORM IN THE NORMAL WAY.  I HAD STEPPED ON THE BRAKE AS I ENTERED THE RAMP AND THE CAR STARTED TO MAKE WIDE SWERVING ARCS FROM SIDE TO SIDE.  WHEN I TRIED TO CENTER THE STEERING WHEEL IT WOULD JUST SWERVE.  THINKING I NEEDED TO SLOW DOWN MORE TO GET BETTER CONTROL OF THE CAR, I STEPPED ON THE BRAKE AGAIN, THAT TIME THE CAR STARTED TO SPIN AROUND.  IT WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL.  AN ONCOMING VEHICLE HIT ME FROM BEHIND AND THAT VEHICLE WAS HIT BY ANOTHER VEHICLE.  MIRACULOUSLY, THERE WERE NO INJURIES.  HOWEVER, I WAS HEADED INTO A VERY BUSY STRETCH OF BELTWAY 8 AND HAD THE FAILURE OCCURRED THERE, SEVERE INJURIES AND DEATH WOULD HAVE BEEN THE OUTCOME.  THE WEATHER ON THAT DAY WAS SUNNY AND IN THE HIGH 70'S.  THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE ROAD TO PREVENT TRACTION.    I REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE DEALERSHIP, WHO THEN TOLD ME IT HAD TO BE HANDLED BY NISSAN.  FIVE WEEKS LATER NISSAN SENT A REPRESENTATIVE TO CHECK THE CAR OUT AND THEY REPORTED NO MANUFACTURING DEFECTS.     THE CAR IS AWAITING PARTS TO REPAIR THE BODY WORK, BUT I HAVE SERIOUS RESERVATIONS ABOUT A RE-OCCURRENCE OF THIS PROBLEM.  I KNOW THAT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT MALFUNCTIONED ON THE CAR AND I FEEL AT THE MERCY OF THE MANUFACTURER.  THEY ARE ENDANGERING MY LIFE AND THE LIFE OF OTHERS. *JB",
