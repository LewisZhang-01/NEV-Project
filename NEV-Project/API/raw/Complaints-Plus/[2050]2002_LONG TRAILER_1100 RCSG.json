        "summary": "IN 2002 I PURCHASED A NEW BOAT TRAILER THAT WAS EQUIPPED WITH NEW CARLISLE TIRES, SURE TRAIL, SIZE 175 80 D13.  I MAINTAINED THE TIRES AT THE RECOMMENDED PRESSURE AT ALL TIMES AND THE LOAD (BOAT, MOTOR, EQUIPMENT AND GAS) WAS BELOW THE RATED CAPACITY OF THE TIRES.      THIS SUMMER, WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, I LOOKED BACK IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR AND SAW THE RIGHT TIRE TREAD PEELING OFF, WITH PIECES FLYING ALL OVER THE ROAD.  UPON INSPECTION, I FOUND THAT THE TIRE TREAD HAD CLEANLY SEPARATED FROM THE TIRE ITSELF.  I INSPECTED THE OTHER TIRE, WHICH HAD NOT BLOWN OUT, AND FOUND DEEP CRACKS IN ALL OF THE GROOVES OF THE TREAD.  CLEARLY, THE TIRE WOULD HAVE BLOWN OUT IF I DID NOT STOP AT THE FIRST TIRE STORE I FOUND AND REPLACED IT.  THE FOLLOWING FACTORS CLEARLY INDICATE THAT THE TIRES WERE DEFECTIVE: 1) THE SEPARATION OF THE TIRE TREAD FROM THE BLOWN OUT TIRE, 2) DEEP CRACKING IN THE OTHER TIRE, 3) THE LACK OF ANY TREAD WEAR AND DRY ROT, AND 4) THE TIRES ONLY HAD APPROXIMATLEY 2,000 MILES AND TWO YEARS OF USE.  FURTHERMORE, BASED ON AN INTERNET SEARCH, I FOUND THAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE WITH CARLISLE TIRES.  I CONTACTED THE COMPANY AND WAS REFERRED TO RICK TAYLOR, QUALITY MANAGER. I LEFT THREE MESSAGES FOR MR. TAYLOR AND RECEIVED NO REPLY. I MADE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO REACH SOMEONE (MINDY ??), BUT DID NOT HEAR BACK FROM HER.  IT APPEARS THAT THE COMPANY IS AWARE OF THE QUALITY PROBLEMS AND IS IGNORING THEM, HOPING THAT IT WILL JUST GO AWAY.  CLEARLY, THEY SHOULD BE FORCED TO RECALL THE TIRES.*AK",
