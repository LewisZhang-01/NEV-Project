        "summary": "For the past few months, I have been having issues with my vehicle stalling.  This issue occurs while stopped at red lights, stop signs, and while sitting in stop and go traffic.  My vehicle is equipped with the Auto Start/Stop feature, and while stopped at a stop sign for instance, the vehicle will auto stop but fail to auto start when taking my foot off the brake and hitting the gas.  This has happened on numerous occasions, putting those in the vehicle and those in other vehicles around my vehicle at risk.    I brought my vehicle to my local dealership, at which point they checked it and found nothing wrong with the vehicle.  They also stated that they, and the vehicle manufacturer were aware of the issue, but have no solution for it.  The first time I brought the vehicle in, the dealer told me that a possible fix was an update to the system, however I would have to pay for the update.  After the service adviser spoke with the service manager a few times, the dealership paid for the $220 update.  The vehicle has since continued to stall, the only thing that seems to assist is to turn off the Auto Start/Stop feature every time  the vehicle is turned on.  Last Thursday, the vehicle stalled again on my wife with our son in the vehicle at a t-intersection.  The vehicle failed to start for approximately 10-15 minutes.  I contacted my dealer again and was advised to bring my vehicle in.  I brought it in and was told that I could have a rental car, but that I would need to approve paying a $160 diagnostic fee.  They were unsure of a permanent solution for the problem.",

It happens even without the keys being present. As a result, the battery drains while the car is parked.  We took our car to the dealership where we bought it and they confirmed the issue and stated we needed to replace our keyless access/TPMS unit to start and that we may need to a new start/stop switch. It cost $190.83 with tax to access. The car is serviced at Klein Honda in Everett, WA. The R/O number for the service visit is 652453/1.  Instances of other Honda owners experiencing similar car issues can be found here: https://www.piloteers.org/threads/control-unit-problems.168522/  I noted that the 2016-2017 honda pilots have a recall/service bulletin for the start/stop switch (Honda Service Bulletin 20-117) and was told by the dealership my car is not included. I find that very disappointing since I own a 2017 honda pilot. I was quoted a repair cost of $967.36 + tax. This did not include the cost of the part (part number 38320-TG7-A32) costing $469.36 with tax. Therefore the total cost of the repair is greater than $1500.  I ordered the part on March 16, 2022 and it is on back-order with no expected arrival date. I cannot currently drive my car because the battery is constantly being drained when the car is off due to this error. Our low-mileage 2017 Pilot (delivered on 5/31/17) should not have the failure(s) noted above. I am not aware of a greater recall that addresses the failure(s) and was told that our car is outside of the manufacturers warranty that could cover this since it is not part of the powertrain.",

It is very intermittent,  but seems to happen most after it is warm and is restarted after sitting less than 1 hour like going in somewhere to shop or eat. Other times it has happened in the summer when idling the car with the air conditioning running for 10-15 minutes. It is not an exhaust smell,  but unburnt gasoline. The dealer smelled it when I dropped it off,  but couldn't find anything wrong. It has been happening for over a year.  After several months we got a check engine light,  it was an issue with the evaporative canister. An $1,100 repair was made outside of warranty.  We hoped this would at least fix the issue. It did not fix it. The smell happens regardless of gas tank level and is not from over filling the tank.",

After a few moments, I restarted the engine and the only anomaly I observed was the warning indicator light on the dash read: emissions system problem. There was roughly 1/4 to 1/2 tank of gasoline remaining at the time of incidence.

Obviously, this is a very dangerous situation that could kill or maim myself or an occupant of another vehicle;  the police officer who happened to own the other vehicle said I should not drive my vehicle until the problem is solved, which, of course, makes sense as my vehicle at present is unpredictable and dangerous.    I have now taken the vehicle into the dealer, but I've found in the past these intermittent problems are difficult to diagnose.  Should it not be diagnosed and fixed--I noticed that others have had this same vexing and dangerous situation, and it was not fixed or resoved to their satisfaction--I will no longer drive the vehicle as it is too dangerous.

When I let off the brake instead of the car restarting or gearing up and accelerating, the car just died. Warning lights went off on the dash, but the car wouldn't restart for at least a minute both times. No warning lights were on the dash before the incident and after the car restarted, no warning lights remained lit on the dash. I took my car to an automotive store and had them check the battery, the alternator and the starter - all of these came back as being in perfect condition. I was extremely scared when both of these incidents occurred. One time I was at the bottom of an exit ramp of a busy interstate and the other occurred on an interstate in stop and go traffic.   In addition to these two incidents, for the past 2 years, the car has been having issues after it idles down and then should restart and accelerate. About 2-3 times per month, when the car is stopped and has idled down, when I let off the brake and accelerate, the electrical system will flash on and off. The entire dash goes dark, the audio goes off and comes back on, etc. The entire electrical system reboots. When this happens, it does not impact the ability of the car to accelerate because it is more like a flash - the car doesn't die and have to be restarted.  I am taking my car into the Honda dealer on Monday to attempt to diagnose the problem, but from the research I've done, may other Pilot owners are having the same problem and their dealers aren't able to find an error code caused by these issues. I have been attempting to get a video of this when it happens, but so far, I've been unable to reproduce the issue.",

The car coasts and there is no resistance to the pedal either. No warning lights are shown on the dashboard and I am not using cruise control either. After pressing down repeatedly on the gas pedal for about 15-20 seconds, the gas pedal starts working again. This is a big safety issue, since the car gas pedal is completely unrepsonsive, so I cannot accelerate to change lanes, avoid another car or person, etc. and this occurs at random times. Also, when driving at low speeds, the gas pedal is often unresponsive and lags for about 3-5 seconds when I press on the pedal, making the car hesitate. Also, when the car changes gears, it is often very jerky (not smooth) and this occurs randomly. I took the Honda Pilot to the Honda dealer where I purchased the car and they duplicated all of the problems reported above and also documented error codes via their computer while driving the Honda Pilot. The dealer has had the car since May 5, 2021 and has not been able to fix it so far, despite working with the Honda \"tech-line\". So the dealer requested an \"expert\" from Honda in Torrance, CA (headquarters I'm told) to come to the dealer on-site, but the expert cannot arrive until May 21, 2021. The Honda service person told me they have recorded many error codes, but some of the codes are \u201cnot current codes\u201d, so they don't know how to fix it so far.",

THE ENGINE STALL IS DIFFICULT TO RECOVER FROM SINCE THE CAR MUST FIRST BE PUT IN PARK THEN RESTARTED, WHICH IS NOT INTUITIVE, ESPECIALLY WHEN UNDER STRESS IN TRAFFIC OR DEPARTING FROM A TRAFFIC LIGHT. THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN INTERMITTENT FOR ABOUT A YEAR. OUR LOCAL HONDA DEALER ATTEMPTED TO FIX THE PROBLEM BUT THE ONLY THING THEY COULD SPECULATE WAS THAT UNDER THE AUTO-STOP FEATURE WITH THE ENGINE IDLED, BATTERY VOLTAGE DROPS AND THE CAR'S COMPUTER RESTARTS THE ENGINE BEFORE THE VOLTAGE GETS TOO LOW. HOWEVER, IF THE SYSTEM DOESN'T RESTART THE CAR WITH ADEQUATE BATTERY CRANKING AMPS REMAINING, THE ENGINE MAY STALL VICE RESTART AS REQUIRED. THIS OCCURS EITHER WHEN THE VOLTAGE GETS LOW ENOUGH OR WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL IS RELEASED. BASED UPON THIER BEST ASSESSMENT AND INABILITY TO FIND ANY SPECIFIC FAULT, WE REPLACED THE BATTERY PER THEIR SUGGESTION. HOWEVER THE PROBLEM RECURRED ABOUT TWO MONTHS LATER. ON THE INTERNET, WE FOUND NUMEROUS CASES OF THIS TYPE OF FAULT. IN SEVERAL INSTANCES, IT CAUSED A CHALLENGING SITUATION IN TRAFFIC OR AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT, WHICH HAS BEEN OUR EXPERIENCE AS WELL. THE ONLY WORK-AROUND THAT OTHERS HAVE REPORTED REASONABLE SUCCESS WITH WAS TO PUSH THE AUTO-STOP DISABLE BUTTON UPON STARTING THE CAR. THIS OF COURSE IS A WORK-AROUND AND HONDA SHOULD ISSUE A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.",

AEI SHUTS THE ENGINE OFF WHEN THE CAR IS IN DRIVE BUT FULLY STOPPED AND, IN THEORY, INCREASES FUEL EFFICIENCY BY REDUCING ENGINE IDLING WHEN THE CAR IS STOPPED, E.G. AT A STOPLIGHT OR IN STOP-AND-GO TRAFFIC. WHILE THERE IS A BUTTON TO DISABLE IT, THIS BUTTON HAS TO BE PRESSED EACH TIME YOU TURN THE CAR ON AND CANNOT BE PERMANENTLY DISABLED. WE TRY TO REMEMBER TO ALWAYS PRESS THE BUTTON AND DISABLE THE FEATURE BUT OCCASIONALLY FORGET AND DON'T REALIZE WE HAVEN'T DISABLED IT UNTIL WE COME TO A STOP SOMEWHERE AND THE FEATURE ENGAGES AND THE ENGINE SHUTS OFF. AEI WOULD JUST BE A NUISANCE IF IT WORKED 100% OF THE TIME AS IT IS DESIGNED TO WORK BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, IT DOESN'T. WHEN IT WORKS AND THE BRAKE PEDAL IS FULLY DEPRESSED, THE ENGINE IS AUTOMATICALLY IDLED, AND THEN AS YOU BEGIN TO LIFT YOUR FOOT OFF THE BRAKE PEDAL, THE ENGINE QUICKLY TURNS BACK ON, YOU'RE ALREADY IN DRIVE, AND YOU GO. HOWEVER, ON WHAT SEEMS TO BE A COMPLETELY RANDOM AND UNPREDICTABLE BASIS, SOMETIMES WHEN YOU BEGIN TO LIFT YOUR FOOT OFF THE BRAKE PEDAL, RATHER THAN HAVING THE ENGINE RESTART AUTOMATICALLY, THE ENTIRE CAR JUST GOES DEAD. AT THIS POINT, YOU HAVE TO FRANTICALLY PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND COMPLETELY RESTART THE ENGINE. IF YOU'RE LUCKY, THIS HAPPENS QUICKLY AND YOU'RE NOT STUCK IN A COMPROMISED SPOT WITH NO ONE BEARING DOWN ON YOU FROM BEHIND BUT BY ITS DESIGN YOU ARE SOMEWHERE YOU NEED AND WANT TO BE MOVING FROM QUICKLY, AND IT HAS HAPPENED AT THE EXACT MOMENT WHEN YOU TRY TO ACCELERATE. THIS HAS HAPPENED TO BOTH MYSELF AND MY WIFE A HANDFUL OF TIMES IN SCARY SITUATIONS. READ ALL THE OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET - NO SERVICE REP ANYWHERE HAS AN EXPLANATION.

I HAVE TAKEN IT IN TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR AN INSPECTION AND IT WAS DETERMINED THERE IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED WITH A SOFTWARE UPDATE FROM AMERICAN HONDA. I'VE BEEN PLAYING PHONE TAG WITH HONDA SINCE AND FINALLY GOT TO SPEAK WITH JAMES (1-800-999-1009 EXT 117753), TODAY FROM AMERICAN HONDA. HE DID NOT ASSURE ME THAT THE ISSUE WAS BEING LOOKED INTO OR THAT THEY WERE WORKING ON SOMETHING TO CORRECT IT. INSTEAD, TOLD ME REPEATEDLY THAT THERE ARE NO ISSUES WITH MY VEHICLE AND IT WAS DESIGNED THAT WAY. HE STATES HE'S SPOKEN WITH MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP WHO HAS CONFIRMED THAT MY HEATERS DO NOT WORK PROPERLY, BUT AGAIN CONTINUED TO TELL ME THERE WERE NO ISSUES WITH MY CAR. OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS A FAULT IN THE DESIGN, AND HE REFUSED TO ADMIT THAT OR OFFER A ADEQUATE RESOLUTION. WHEN I ASKED TO BE ESCALATED HE OFFERED TO CONNECT ME WITH WITH ANOTHER REPRESENTATIVE TO REVIEW MY CASE. I ASSURED HIM I DID NOT WISH TO SPEAK WITH ANOTHER REPRESENTATIVE AND REQUESTED A MANGER AT WHICH POINT HE TOLD ME HE WAS A MANAGER. A MANGER OFFERING TO CONNECT ME TO A REPRESENTATIVE? WHERE'S THE LOGIC IN THAT OR ANY OF THIS? HONDA DOES NOT DESERVE ANYONE'S BUSINESS IF THEY AREN'T WILLING TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO FIND A RESOLUTION.",
