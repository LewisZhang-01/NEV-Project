They documented the damage and ordered a new headrest which has not yet been fulfilled (a 9-month wait so far).

I first noticed the problem when I was driving at 75 MPH between Mertzon Texas and Barnhart Texas, where there is no cell service unless you are on top of a hill. Then suddenly the check engine and the oil light came on and the vehicle began to lose speed no matter how much I pushed the gas peddle. The engine felt like it was running out of power and i was unable to accelerate, the engine began to stall and would not allow me to go over 15mph. The problem continued to get worse, while I pulled over and stopped, the engine would idle very heavily and sound rough. When I tried to proceed, the engine would stall, and my foot would be presing down on the gas pedalbut the car would not accelerate. Then after about a minute or the with the gas pedal down to the floor, the vehicle's rpms would jump and the it would go. But it continued the same pattern for about 15 miles, then it just died and would not start again for a few hours, but the issue was still the same, it would start but not move. Another issue is when the vehicle would be in park position and I would try to go in reverse, the engine would sound like it went into reverse, but it would not move, it would stall out and die. I have taken it to so many shops and they can not give an answer, they just say that the motor is blown. The problem is consistent with the NHS Recal-13V552000, so why does it still say that my vin in not affected when actually it is, but nothing is being done.",

THANKFULLY I WAS IN THE SLOW LANE AND WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER TO THE RIGHT. AFTER BEING ALL SHAKEN UP, AGAIN I HAD WAITIED A FEW MINUTES AND CAR STARTED AND DROVE AS IF NOTING HAPPEND. IT WAS ONE OF THE SCARIEST THINGS I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. I HAVE TAKEN IT TO LOCAL MECHANICS AND THEY DINT KNOW WHATS WRONG WITH IT. SO I AM CURRENTLY DRVING MY CAR AND WONDERING WHEN THE CAR WILL STALL AGAIN. IT STILL BUCKS AND JERKS, FEELS LIKE IT WILL STALL SO I TAKE MY FOOT OFF THE GAS PEDDLE AND THAT SEEMS TO HELP. I NO LONGER DRIVE THIS CAR ON THE HIGHWAY AS I AM SCARED TO DEATH OF GETTING INTO A CAR ACCIDENT. I STRICTLY USE THIS CAR TO TRAVEL TO AND FROM WORK. I AM TIRED OF SENDING THIS CAR TO THE DEALERSHIPS AND MECHANICS WITH NO RESOLUTIONS. I WANT TO TRADE THIS CAR IN, BUT AM AFRAID FOR THE NEXT PERSON.  I THINK THIS CAR NEEDS TO BE RECALLED. THESE CARS SHOULD NOT BE ON THE ROAD PERIOD!!",

THE DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE HOSE CLAMP, FILLED WITH TRANSMISSION FLUID AND RELEASED IT BACK TO ME.  HAD I KNOWN WHAT HELL I WOULD BE DEALING WITH AFTERWARDS I WOULD HAVE NEVER BROUGHT IT BACK HOME.  I NOW HAVE ELECTRICAL ISSUES (I BELIEVE).  THE CAR WILL OVERHEAT WITHIN MINUTES OF DRIVING IT.  I HAVE NO HEAT. THE ETC LIGHT COMES ON OFTEN AND THE ENGINE LIGHT IS NOW A CONSTANT.  I HAVE HAD IT TO THE REPAIR SHOP TO MANY TIMES TO COUNT NOW AND THEY ARE UNABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT.  JEEP HAS OFFERED NO ASSISTANCE AND STATES THAT THERE ARE NO OTHER ISSUES LIKE MINE, BUT WHEN I LOOK AT BLOGS THERE ARE THOUSANDS.  I FEEL DOOPED BY JEEP.  THIS COMPLAINT IS MY LAST RESORT BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

I LOOKED ON THE INTERNET FOR A REMEDY AND NOTICED THOUSAND OF COMPLAINTS RELATED TO THIS SAME ISSUE INVOLVING MOST JEEP VEHICLES. ONE VEHICLE ONLY HAD 31,000 MILES WHEN THEIR TRANSMISSION FAILED.  MY VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY AT THE AUTOMOTIVE SHOP. THEY STATED THAT I HAVE 3 OPTIONS WHICH INCLUDE REBUILD MY CURRENT TRANSMISSION (WHICH MAY BE A TOTAL LOSS) , BUY A USED TRAMSMISSION ( NO GUARANTEE OF WHEN ANOTHER FAILURE WILL OCCUR), OR BUY A NEW TRANSMISSION FROM THE DEALERSHIP (NO GUARANTEE OF WHEN FAILURE WILL OCCUR). THE AUTOMOTIVE SHOP STATED THAT THERE IS A PARTS SHORTAGE DUE TO THIS ISSUE AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE PARTS TO REBUILD THE TRANSMISSION AND ALSO LACK OF USED TRANSMISSIONS DUE TO THE SAME ISSUE. I JUST BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE 1 YEAR AGO AND WILL HAVE TO PAY THOUSANDS TO FIX IT DUE TO A KNOWN PROBLEM IN THE AUTOMOTIVE COMMUNITY WITHOUT ANY GUARANTEE OF WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. THE OWNER OF MY LOCAL AUTOMOTIVE SHOP TOLD ME TO SELL IT BECAUSE OF THE KNOWN TRANSMISSION FAILURE. I SAVED MONEY TO BUY THIS JEEP WITH CASH AND DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO CONTINUALLY REPLACE TRANSMISSIONS IN IT. BIG PROBLEM FOR JEEP AND QUALITY OF THEIR PRODUCTS. BIGGER PROBLEM FOR THE OWNERS THAT ARE PAYING THOUSANDS TO FIX THEIR VEHICLES. THEIR TRANSMISSIOMS SHOULD BE RECALLED DUE TO NOT MODEL SPECIFIC. ALL JEEP MODELS ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES.

AT NO TIME WAS IT EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THIS WAS A SAFETY FEATURE WITH A BROKEN PIECE.  WHEN I SEARCHED ONLINE FOR REPLACEMENT HEADRESTS, I WAS ABLE TO LEARN THAT THIS IS A SAFETY FEATURE THAT MALFUNCTIONED AND HAS AFFECTED OTHER DRIVERS. THIS MALFUNCTION POSES A RISK TO DRIVERS IF IT HAPPENS WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION (I WAS LUCKY). A SMALL PIECE IN THE HEADREST IS ALSO BREAKING, PREVENTING THE RESTRAINTS FROM BEING RESET AND COSTING OWNERS THE HIGH PRICE OF REPLACING THE HEADRESTS. I, LIKE MANY, AM NO LONGER COVERED UNDER WARRANTY FOR THIS LARGE COST, WHICH SHOULD BE COVERED BY JEEP GIVEN ITS SERIOUSNESS AND FREQUENCY.  THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

I WAS DRIVING ON HIGHWAY WITH MY 5 YEAR OLD SON WHEN THE CAR STARTED SHAKING AND CLUNKING UNCONTROLLABLY. I PULLED OVER THINKING I HAD A FLAT TIRE BUT DID NOT. WENT TO MECHANIC, WHERE THEY REPLACED FAULTY SWAY BAR AND ALSO INSTALLED AN EXHAUST SPRING BOLT KIT THAT WAS NEVER INSTALLED TO BEGIN WITH. GET THE CAR BACK TO NOT ONLY HAVE THE SAME  ISSUES AGAIN ALONG WITH ISSUES WITH TRANSMISSION SEEMING TO SLIP. I WAS APPROACHING  A RED LIGHT- AGAIN WITH MY SON IN THE CAR, WHILE BREAKING- THE CAR JUMPS RPM AND  ALMOST RAN INTO CAR IN FRONT OF ME. ALSO ON CRUISE CONTROL THE CAR WOULDN'T STOP REV'N THE ENGINE. IT WAS STUCK OVER 4 RPM. I BOUGHT THIS CAR FOR SAFETY BUT IT IS FAR FROM SAFE.  THERE WAS AN AIRBAG RECALL BUT WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR IT WAS MARKED AS A SEAT BELT RECALL. I WOULD OF STEERED CLEAR IF I KNEW ABOUT AIRBAG BUT NOW I KNOW AIRBAG MAY NOT WORK IN CRASH OR WILL DEPLOY RANDOMLY EVEN IF IT WAS FIXED IT'S NOT A LEGIT FIX DUE TO ELECTRICAL?! ALSO I BELIEVE THE RECALL ON 2.4 ENGINES SHOULD ALSO BE LOOKED INTO FOR MORE POSSIBLE CARS AFFECTED. MY CAR FOLLOWS SAME PROBLEMS AS THOSE RECALLED AND SAME ENGINE BUT MINES NOT RECALLED. THIS CAR CLUNKS IN AND OUT OF DRIVEWAYS. IT FEELS LIKE IT WILL FALL APART. THE WEATHER STRIPING IS POOR ALLOWING WATER TO GET IN CAUSING MOLDY SMELL. THE BRAKE LIGHTS ACCUMULATE WATER. THERE SEEM TO BE SIGNS OF ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS HOWEVER MECHANIC CAN'T SEE IT. CAN'T CHARGE PHONE AN  LISTEN TO RADIO UNLESS YOU LIKE STATIC! SAME WITH AUX CORD, JUST STOPPED WORKING. ASIDE FROM LOOKING NICE- CRYSLER DID A TERRIBLE JOB WITH THIS PARTICULAR PATRIOT. POORLY BUILT, NOT WORTH THE MONEY. THEY RATHER HAVE PEOPLE DIE OR GET SERIOUSLY INJURED BEFORE LOOKING INTO RECALLING IT RIGHT? MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO FIX IT HAVE BEEN MADE AND CAR IS STILL IN THE SHOP.",

ON THE WAY BACK HOME, THE ETC LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN -- FLASHING, THEN OFF -- CAR STAYED ROLLING. PERHAPS IT IS MORE INCLINED TO STALL GOING UPHILL WITH THE ETC, AND WHILE IT'S ROLLING DOWNHILL, LESS INCLINED TO STALL? WHO KNOWS, BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS JUST A COUPLE PATRIOTS OUT THERE, BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY MORE THAN 500 PEOPLE WHO'VE COMPLAINED OF THIS ISSUE.   I CONTACTED DEALER - BUT THEY DID NOT ADMIT TO ANY RECALLS FOR MY PATRIOT  - EVEN WHEN I STATED OTHERS HAVE HAD THIS EXACT ISSUE. I AM VERY RELUCTANT TO TAKE MY JEEP ANYWHERE BUT A FEW BLOCKS IN THIS WINTER WEATHER. THIS WAS TRULY THE FIRST TIME I FELT UNSAFE IN IT. MILEAGE IS 89,000. HOWEVER, SHOULD AN ACCIDENT OCCUR I WILL CERTAINLY SUE THE COMPANY.  *TR",

I CAN'T BELIEVE JEEP WOULD PRODUCE A CAR WITH BRAKES WHERE SQUEALING/SQUEAKING IS NORMAL!!  A FEW MONTHS LATER I CALLED JEEP SERVICE AGAIN AND THE SERVICE TECH TOLD ME THEY GOT A LOT OF THE SAME COMPLAINTS AND JEEP CORPORATE IS AWARE OF THE ISSUE. I WAS NOT TOLD OF ANY PLANS THEY HAVE TO FIX THE ISSUE.  *TR",

HOWEVER THE OWNER'S MANUAL, USER GUIDE AND WARRANTY INFORMATION WERE NOT REVISED, EVEN DOWN TO THE OLDER PATRIOT MODEL COVER PAGE PICTURES!  WHEN I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND CHRYSLER/JEEP ABOUT THE ISSUES THEY SAID THAT THEY DEEMED THE VEHICLE TO BE A 2014 BECAUSE IT WAS MANUFACTURED BEFORE AUGUST AND THAT THE DIFFERENCES IN THE OWNER'S MANUAL AND USER GUIDE WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

I WAS SHIFTED INTO DRIVE AND WOULD HIT THE GAS PEDAL AND NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING THAT IS WAS GOING TO STALL, NO INDICATOR LIGHTS EVER TURNED ON. I PLACED THE JEEP IN PARK AND TURNED OFF THE IGNITION. TURNED IT BACK ON, IT WAS NOT IMMEDIATE THERE WAS SOME LAG ON THE START AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE IT AGAIN. I TOOK IT TO MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP TODAY TO BE INSPECTED AFTER A FEW HOURS THEY TOLD ME THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG AND SENT ME ON MY WAY. I HAVE INVESTIGATED FURTHER AND FOUND THAT THE 2011/2012 MODELS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM IN THE PAST. THIS IS A TERRIFYING AND DANGEROUS OCCURRENCE THAT MUST BE RESOLVED. I AM NOW FEARFUL THAT THIS WILL REOCCUR IN MUCH MORE CONGESTED OR HIGH SPEED CONDITIONS.  *TR",

I BACK UP, PUT THE VEHICLE IN 4X4 LOW AND IF ANY WHEEL SLIPS, IT WOULD STOP AT 2,000 RPM AGAIN.  ALL I CAN DO IS BACK DOWN A DANGEROUS ROAD AND TRY TO FIND A SPOT WHERE I CAN TURN AROUND.  THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES, BEEN TO 2 DEALERS IN 2 STATES 4 TIMES. THE VEHICLE STRANDED ME ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS DOING THE SAME THING IN DANGEROUS AREA WITH CLIFFS OR STEEP DROP OFFS TO RIVERS AND ROCK OUT CROPS ON ONE SIDE. CHRYSLER HQ SAID THEY WILL NOT WORK ON MY VEHICLE ANYMORE AND THAT THE TRUCK IS PERFORMING AS DESIGNED! DESIGNED TO STRAND SOMEONE ON A WELL TRAVELED MINING ROAD THE OTHER PICKUPS CAN GET TO WITHOUT 4X4?  I BOUGHT THIS 4X4 WITH THE OFF ROAD TRAIL RATED PACKAGE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE SELLING DEALER SAID I NEEDED FOR MINING. IT HAS NOT BEEN OFF ROAD. I CAN'T EVEN GET TO WHERE I WORK AND THIS VEHICLE HAS EVEN FAILED ON VERY SMALL HILLS WITH DEALERSHIP PERSONNEL IN THE VEHICLE. ANOTHER DEALER TEST DROVE IT, FAILED AND WOULDN'T GO OVER 2,300 RPM. THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  THEY DUPLICATED THE PROBLEM IN 4X4 DRIVE, 4X4 LOW, WITH AND WITHOUT TRACTION CONTROL.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE VEHICLE WILL NOT PULL ITS OWN WEIGHT AND NO WHEELS ARE EVEN SPINNING. VERY DANGEROUS DESIGN AND CAN'T EVEN GET TO MY JOB!  WHEN I HAVE TO BACK DOWN BECAUSE IT WILL NOT GO FORWARD I HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT'S A PLACE PERPENDICULAR TO THE SLOPE OF THE INCLINE OR YOU ARE STUCK DIAGONAL TO THE ROAD AND THE VEHICLE WILL NOT GO FORWARD AND THERE IS NO MORE ROOM TO BACK UP WITHOUT GOING OFF A CLIFF, FALLING INTO A RIVER OR SLIDING INTO A CANYON.   *TR",

A WEEK AFTER TAKING DELIVERY OF THIS NEW CAR WITH AROUND 470 MILES ON THE ODE METER, IT WAS NOTICED THAT DURING PERIODS OF GENTLE BRAKING, THE BRAKES APPEARED TO FAIL AND THE CAR WOULD ACCELERATED DURING THE SHORT PERIODS THE BRAKES WOULD FAIL. THE FIRST OCCURRENCE WAS NOTICED AT AROUND 30 MPH IN STEADY URBAN TRAFFIC. THE BRAKES APPEARED TO FAIL AGAIN ABOUT 10 MIN LATER IN SIMILAR TRAFFIC. DURING THESE 2 FAILURES THE BRAKES APPEARED TO FAIL FOR AROUND A QUARTER OF A SECOND. ABOUT 1/2 AN HOUR LATER, IN STEADY FREEWAY TRAFFIC OF 55 TO 60 MPH AT AROUND 3.30 PM, GENTLE BRAKING WAS NEEDED AND THE BRAKES FAILED AND THE CAR ACCELERATED FOR ABOUT A PERIOD OF ONE TO ONE AND A HALF SECONDS. I WAS VERY CLOSE TO RAMMING THE CAR IN FRONT. DURING THE PERIODS OF FAILURE, THE BRAKE PEDAL REMAINS FIRM AND SOLID, IT IS AS IF THE BRAKES ARE ELECTRONICALLY SWITCHED OFF AND THEN ELECTRONICALLY SWITCHED ON AGAIN. DURING THE PERIODS OF FAILURES, THE APPLICATION OF ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL DOES NOT STOP THE CAR ACCELERATING. THE FASTER THE SPEED, THE LONGER THE PERIOD THAT THE BRAKES APPEAR TO FAIL. IT WAS A PRETTY SCARY EXPERIENCE.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS, WHEN YOU APPLY THE BRAKES IN ANY CAR, THE DRIVER NEEDS TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT THE CAR WILL SLOW DOWN AND STOP SAFELY,  THE LAST THING A CAR SHOULD DO, IS ACCELERATE WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL IS PRESSED, IT TOTALLY DESTROYS THE SAFE BRAKING 3 SECOND RULE.  THE MANUFACTURE HAS DETERMINED THAT THE TRANSMISSION SOFTWARE IS THE PROBLEM AND IT COULD TAKE UP TO A YEAR TO REWRITE THE SOFTWARE. THIS, IN MY OPINION, IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND ALL 2014 JEEP PATRIOT AND COMPASS WITH 6 SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS SHOULD BE TAKE OFF THE ROAD.  NHTSA ARE WELCOME TO A TEST DRIVE, THESE BRAKE FAILURE/ACCELERATION ISSUES OCCUR EVERY TIME THE CAR IS DRIVEN. *TR",
