I HAVE SINCE LEARNED THAT HONDA HAS A \"PRODUCT CAMPAIGN\" TELLING SOME OWNERS OF HONDA ACCORDS ABOUT THIS VERY PROBLEM (BALANCER SHAFT OIL SEAL)  AND TELLING THEM TO GET IT REPAIRED AT A DEALER OR IF THEY ALREADY HAD THE PROBLEM, TO GET REIMBURSEMENT FROM HONDA.  MY FRIEND GOT THIS LETTER.  HIS IS A 94 HONDA, MINE A 93.  BAIERL TELLS ME MY YEAR IS NOT COVERED, HOWEVER, I NOTICED IN YOUR TECHNICAL BULLETIN DATA BASE THAT  NHTSA ITEM NUMBER SBO49981 WAS ISSUED ON THIS PROBLEM FOR BOTH 1993 AND 1994 HONDAS.  I ALSO NOTICED IN YOUR COMPLAINT DATA BASE ON 1993 HONDAS, THAT THERE ARE OTHER COMPLAINTS WITH THIS EXACT PROBLEM.  I WAS FORTUNATE IN THAT I GOT HOME BEFORE THE OIL COMPLETELY RAN OUT.  OTHERS WHO HAVE FILED COMPLAINTS WITH YOU WERE NOT SO FORTUNATE, INCURRING SERIOUS ENGINE DAMAGE.  THIS SEEMS TO BE A LONG KNOWN PROBLEM WIT HONDAS AND I FEEL HONDA SHOULD REIMBURSE ME JUST AS THEY ARE THOSE WITH 94S AND HIGHER.   I HAVE THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM.  IT IS A SERIOUS ENGINEERING DEFECT THAT CLEARLY STARTED BEFORE 1994.  IT COST ME $521.68 TO REPAIR THIS.  NOW I HAVE A QUARTER SIZE LEAK OF OIL EVERY MORNING THAT NEVER EXISITED PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT AND THE DEALER CLAIMS THERE IS NOTHING WRONG.  THE DEALER ALSO SAYS THAT 1993 HONDAS DID NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM, BUT SINCE THERE IS A TECHNICAL BULLETIN, HE IS CLEARLY IN THE DARK IF NOT LYING.  I HAVE TRIED TO CONTACT HONDA AMERICA BUT EACH TIME I DO, I AM TOLD THE CALL VOLUME IS HIGH AND TO CALL BACK LATER AND THEN I AM CUT OFF.  I ASKED BAIERL HONDA TO CONTACT HONDA ON MY BEHALF AND THEY TOLD ME THEY COULD NOT.

THE HOOD WITH THE LOOSE STRIKER WAS NOT DAMAGED IN THE CURRENT CRASH, BUT WAS REPLACED SOME TIME BEFORE. IT TURNS OUT THAT THE HOOD WAS AN AFTERMARKET HOOD NOT MADE BY HONDA. I REPLACED THE HOOD FOR THE CUSTOMER WITH A FACTORY HONDA HOOD AT NO CHARGE TO THE CUSTOMER. WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN INSPECTING THE AFTERMARKET HOOD? I REALIZE THIS IS A HOT TOPIC AFTER THE STATE FARM VERTICT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. I CAN SEE NO SIGNS OF STRESS IN THE METAL WHERE THE STRIKER PULLED OUT. IT WAS NEVER CRIMPED DOWN AT THE FACTORY. THIS HOOD PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BLOWN UP ON THE HIGHWAY SOMEDAY CAUSING THE DRIVER TO BECOME BLINDED BECAUSE THE HOOD IS OVER THE WINDSHEILD. THIS IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF WHAT CONCERNS THE BODYSHOP INDUSTRY CONCERNING AFTERMARKET PARTS. PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME! JIM CHAMPION.  *AK",
