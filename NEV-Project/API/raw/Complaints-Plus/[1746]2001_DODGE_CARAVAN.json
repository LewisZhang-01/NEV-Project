SOMETIMES THE DOORS & LIFTGATE WILL ALSO KICKBACK AS IF SOMETHING IS OBSTRUCTING THE PATHWAY.  THIS ALSO OCURRS WHEN USING THE KEYLESS REMOTE OR INSIDE REMOTE BUTTONS.   I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION REGARDING DOORS & LIFTGATE OPENING WITHOUT WARNING FROM MY LOCAL NEWS STATION BACK IN DECEMBER OF 2004.  I HAD PREVIOUSLY BROUGHT MY VAN TO THE DEALERSHIP REGARDING THIS PROBLEM BUT SINCE THEY COULD NEVER DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM THEY INFORMED ME THEY COULD NOT FIX MY VAN.  I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO SHOW THE DEALERSHIP THE PROBLEM WHEN I BROUGHT MY CAR IN FOR SERVICE BACK IN JANUARY 2005.  THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL OR INVESTIGATION BUT WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY DTC INCOMPLETE POWER OPEN LATCH FAILURE, INCOMPLETE LATCH RELEASE PAW SW FAILURE.  I HAVE ACTUAL SERVICE NOTATION OF WHAT THE DEALERSHIP DETERMINED TO BE THE PROBLEM & HOW TO FIX IT.  THE DEALERSHIP ALLOWED A GOODWILL SERVICE ON ONE DOOR & THE POWER LIFTGATE.  THEY WOULD NOT & COULD NOT FIX THE OTHER DOOR BECAUSE THEY ONCE AGAIN COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE PROBLEM ON THE OTHER DOOR & LIFTGATE BECAUSE THE PROBLEM WAS DUPLICATED IN FRONT OF THEIR EYES.  I CONTINUE TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE ONE POWER DOOR THAT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE TO HAVE A PROBLEM.  I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS SOME PRELIMINARY EVALUATIONS BEING DONE (PE04-054).  HAS ANYTHING BEEN RESOLVED?  I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO HAVE MY INFORMATION & COMPLAINT NOTED.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE NUMBER OF OCURRANCES IS EVEN HIGH THAN NOTED FROM BELOW BECAUSE OF THE AGE OF THE CAR.

WE ARE UNABLE TO DRIVE OUR VAN DURING THE HOURS OF 4:30 PM UNTIL 7 A.M BECAUSE WE DO NOT KNOW IF THE HEADLIGHTS WILL STAY ON OR NOT. I DROVE TODAY AND MADE IT 10 MILES BEFORE THE LIGHTS FLASHED AND WENT OUT. THIS IS NOT A LIGHT BULB ISSUE, IT'S A SWITCH THAT CAN'T BE FIXED.

HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO CHARGE, THEREFORE NO WORK ORDER.  ALL I WANT IS A SMOOTH RIDING VEHICLE THAT'S NOT SHAKING RATTLING AND ROLLING DOWN THE STREET.  I DRIVE 50 MILES ONE WAY TO WORK AND MOST OF THE DRIVE IS HIGHWAY DRIVING.  YOU CAN FEEL EVERY LITTLE BUMP.I FOUND THIS ARTICLE IN USA TODAY.  IT READS:   \"APRIL 25, 2001 '' THE CHRYSLER ARM OF DAIMLERCHRYSLER ANNOUNCED WEDNESDAY A VOLUNTARY RECALL OF SOME NEW MINIVANS, CITING A POSSIBLE FRONT SUSPENSION PROBLEM. NEARLY 11,000 CUSTOMERS ARE AFFECTED BY THE RECALL OF THE 2001 CHRYSLER TOWN & COUNTRY, CHRYSLER VOYAGER, DODGE CARAVAN AND DODGE GRAND CARAVAN MINIVANS BUILT BETWEEN MARCH 22 AND APRIL 21 OF 2001. OWNERS OF RECALLED VEHICLES ARE URGED NOT TO DRIVE THEM. THE AUTOMAKER SAID A BOLT ON THE LOWER CONTROL ARM OF THE FRONT SUSPENSION CAN BREAK, RESULTING IN A LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL.\"  NO ONE MENTIONED THAT THIS WAS A RECALL ITEM.  SO I AM STILL TRYING TO FIX THIS SHAKE RATTLE AND ROLL PROBLEM.  THIS 2001 SUSPENSION IS TRULY JUNK. NOW THE BOTTOM-LINE OR SHOULD I SAY \" BOTTOM OUT\" IS WHAT CAN I DO TO GET A SMOOTH RIDE? I HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY, BUT THE MECHANICS NEED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO AND BE RIGHT.   THIS COULD BE A FLUKE IN THE ASSEMBLY LINE, BUT I DOUBT IT.  THERE ARE TOO MANY OTHER OWNERS WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT.  IF YOU HAVE ANY INFLUENCE WITH ANTWERPEN DODGE IN RANDALLSTOWN, MD, PLEASE HELP ME TO SOLVE THIS PUZZLE.",
