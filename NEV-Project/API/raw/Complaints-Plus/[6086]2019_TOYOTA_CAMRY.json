At a slow speed turning a sharp right to enter a drive through restaurant, I had my right foot on the brake. The car suddenly accelerated on its own,  causing me to jump a curb & lose control. I landed between the restaurant building & drive through, taking out the signs & drive through.  It was sudden & a nightmare. Busted both front tires & We had to get a flatbed truck to remove. Some employees there remarked that I missed a pole by a few inches. They helped me out of the car, taking me inside the restaurant. I was crying & very emotional, but explained what happened.  I phoned my husband immediately & he came. I didn\u2019t hit another car or hurt anybody. I was stoved up & shook up, but otherwise ok. I did get a back X-ray later because of pain, but thankfully no compressed fracture. The police was called & took my registration & helped get a tow truck. I explained what happened.  My husband asked that it be taken to the a Toyota dealership, but it was not as they do not have a repair shop there. The car is in a local shop for repair that the adjuster recommended. Have not received the first part for it as yet.  Insurance adjuster says $8500 in damage by phone, but we do not have a copy of this appraisal as yet. We will need to take it to Toyota for testing as soon as repairs are done & driveable, but regardless,  this is really what happened & I will be afraid to drive this car again.  This is vey dangerous & I could have been killed or killed somebody. We bought our car new in Early 2019 & I really liked it.  I\u2019m posting this now because Toyota should want to know this information asap for the safety of their customers!",

The matter was taken care of by mutual agreement between attorney and other drivers insurance company (AAA). On 03/02/22 I was attempting to renew registration when I was informed that I had to take vehicle to dealer due to a recall on make and model before new registration could be issued. In the evening of 03/02/22 I stopped at the dealer and explained to one of the service reps that I was there because of a recall and he stated that there was a problem with airbags deploying WHILE driving; but it was too late in the evening because they were getting ready to close and the issue would take 2-3 hours to inspect. The following morning prior to the service department opening I dropped the car off for service. However, the service invoice makes no mention of the airbag system inspection. Instead, the invoice is for a low pressure fuel pump issue. As for my safety being affected, I now understand why the attorney handling the insurance claim as well as AAA\u2019s insurance adjuster on the matter both stated \u201cthat\u2019s odd\u201d when they asked me (at separate times) if the airbags had deployed and I answered \u201cno\u201d. Apparently, according to the service techs comment on the recall having to do with airbags,  my safety was in danger at the time of the accident in 2019. But instead of showing that the issue was taken care of on the invoice, in less than 24 hours the problem went from airbags to a low pressure fuel pump. How was my safety put at risk? Being that the impact occurred at the driver\u2019s door while I was driving and airbags failed to deploy, had I not veered to my right up the curb I could\u2019ve suffered serious injury to the left side of my body, at least. Has the problem been reproduced? Unknown. Has the vehicle component been inspected? From techs statement on 03/02/22 and invoice on 03/03/22, UNKNOWN. No warnings of any kind.",

After purchasing I found out it had actually been wrecked & the carfax were not factual, assuming that could be a cause and not the actual vehicle being faulty. The main concern is that it sometimes doesn\u2019t shift or struggles and will unexpectedly jerk into gear, then while cruising it seems to have some sort of lagging feel to it, also like a jerking feeling. I believe it may be a transmission issue but it feels very unsafe if you\u2019re trying to maneuver in traffic when the vehicle isnt shifting properly almost causing another car to hit you",

        "summary": "on 10/29/2021 my daughter was a passenger in her car and was involved in a rear end collision @ approximately 65-70 MPH upon collision with a Toyota Rav4. The Air Bags DID NOT deploy, The seat belt allowed her forward with her breast catching most of the impact, and the front camera system that should have detected the stopped Rav 4 did not alert. We had no error codes nor lights on this car prior and were not aware of any potential recalls. This is a complete failure of a car and safety systems that should have protected her. The entire reason this car was bought WAS to protect her and it completely and utterly failed. She is now in the ER with a broken sternum and currently being evaluated to see if any other vessel damage. We bought this car with the utmost in trust for the safety platform of Toyota as she is a double organ transplant recipient and at this time i am unsure if her transplanted kidney has been injured. The recall needs to immediately be expanded and we should have KNOWN PRIOR that this car had a potential issue and complete failure of all the front end collision safety systems! How is it that the air bags completely failed to deploy? Even the Virginia State Trooper on scene commented that he could not see why they had not deployed. I will follow up with more information and pictures as I obtain them after I make sure my daughter, her kidney graft and her boyfriend are ok.  I am attaching pictures of the car and of the car that was hit. At this time I only have the exterior pictures but will get the State Police Report and also will try to get interior pictures of the car.",

I noticed a message pop up (and quickly disappear) on the dash display saying to \"release the accelerator pedal\" (may not be exact wording of the message as it happened very quickly). I took my foot off the accelerator pedal for a few seconds and then was able to regain acceleration control. When first starting to pull out of the parking lot the vehicle accelerated normally. I originally had more than ample time to pull out into the traffic but after the incident cars were stopping behind me as I was coasting. I had all other control (steering and braking).  Incident 2 - (Five minutes after incident 1) When doing a slow easy U-turn, my Camry lost power and would not accelerate.  Again my first thought was that the engine stalled but that was not the case. A message popped up (and quickly disappeared) on the dash display but I had no time to read it as I was trying to get out of traffic. I believe it was similar to \"release the accelerator pedal\".
