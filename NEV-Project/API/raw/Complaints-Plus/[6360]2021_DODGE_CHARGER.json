I\u2019ve heard many stories and cases about other Dodge Charger owners that have gotten there Chargers stolen as well and I received a recall notice from dodge this week that it\u2019s something about the radio frequency and something about a simple diagnostic tool and it programs a new key instantly and Dodge finally after so many complaints did there research and now put out a recall. My dream car was stolen, crashed and even my insurance company won\u2019t compensate anything and now my vehicle has on its carfax that it was stolen and involved in an accident and the value is now destroyed. I tried getting a selling price thru Carvana and Vroom, well Carvana declined it due to that and Vroom gave me a price value of $30,000 and I bought it for $60,000. Half the value is gone due to a manufacturing issue that made these vehicles so easy to steal and be in the hands of anybody and everybody that doesn\u2019t own it. It was used and abused on my dime and now I have to eat the loss.",
