UPON EXAMINING THE HEADREST, IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE PLASTIC WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO HOLD A 2\"-3\" SILVER METAL RETAINING ROD HAD FAILED. THAT SILVER METAL ROD IS STILL ENGAGED IN THE ELECTRONIC LOCK/RELEASE MECHANISM ATTACHED TO THE BACK OF THE HEAD REST. THE PLASTIC PIECES ON THE SEAT WERE FROM THAT ROD RETAINER.

I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT WOULD'VE HAPPENED IF IT WAS THE DRIVERS HEADREST THAT FAILED, HITTING ME IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD WHILE DRIVING AT 65 MILES AN HOUR ON THE FREEWAY. UNEXPECTEDLY GETTING HIT ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD WHILE DRIVING COULD RESULT IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT!   MY CHRYSLER 200 HAD 38,110 MILES WHEN THIS OCCURED; IT IS BARELY OUT OF WARRANTY.

REMOVING THE HEADRESTS TURN ON THE AIRBAG WARNING INDICATOR.     AS I STATED EARLIER, I FEAR THAT THE DRIVER HEADREST MAY ALSO FAIL AT ANY TIME AND RESULTS IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  I CONTACTED CHRYSLER REQUESTING BOTH OF THESE HEADRESTS TO BE REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY AND AM AWAITING A RESPONSE.",
