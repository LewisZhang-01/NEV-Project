Last fall when I filled it up with gas and left the station to go home, my car stalled 5 times on a very busy road just trying to go home.  It always restarted.  It now does the same thing every time I fill it up with gas.  It will either stall once I leave the station (sometimes multiple times) or jerk back and forth when trying to drive it.  So far it has always restarted, but I am very concerned about my safety if it happens to stall when driving or turning at an intersection and there is an accident because of it.  I understand that their is a lifetime warranty on this problem on these vehicles (Extended Warranty X53); and I would like to get this problem taken care of before I get in an accident.  I have read up on this problem on Dodge Forums and will be calling Dodge in the next few days to see about having this problem taken care of.  This is a definite SAFETY issue and needs to be handled ASAP.",

It would not restart.  Four people nearly died, because we were almost hit by a gravel train truck.  In the middle of the intersection, and could do nothing..If you win the Chrysler VIN lotterey, yours gets fixed and if you don't have that VIN, too bad for you.  So I have a car that has the potential to kill many people because. of a known safety issue that Chrysler fixed on some cars but not all cars.  NHTSA allows a huge safety problem as one that impacts the entire operation of the vehicle to still be on the road without the recall applying to it? One second difference and I and 3 occupants would have been dead.  ONE SECOND.  No warning lights, no codes,  the problem has been seen by every dealer in the USA according to the technicians that looked at my car.  They said it's sad that money means more to Chrysler than Safety. It first started happening just a few weeks ago, I only drive in the summer with this car, so it is low miles also. According to the recall the fuel tank and it's system fail.

I HAVE TO SWITCH GEARS FROM DRIVE TO PARK AND THEN TURN THE CAR OFF AND THEN ON AGAIN IN HOPES IT WILL START.    AS YOU'RE DRIVING, YOU CAN FEEL WHEN THE CAR IS ABOUT TO CUT OFF, IT THROTTLES AHEAD A BIT AND REVS, THEN THE CAR BEEPS AND TURNS OFF, WHILE THE GEAR IS IN DRIVE AND TURNING MY WHEEL DOES NOTHING. I NOTICE THAT THIS ISSUE WOULD USUALLY HAPPEN AFTER A FILL UP MY GAS TANK, SO I STARTED ONLY FILLING UP HALFWAY ,BUT THE ISSUE STILL PERSISTS.    THIS ISSUE BECAME HEAVILY FREQUENT YESTERDAY WHERE THE CAR STALLED AND CUT OFF AT LEAST 4 DIFFERENT TIMES WHILE MAKING A 7 MILE DRIVE BACK HOME. THIS WAS VERY VERY SCARY IN MY EYES, ESPECIALLY WITH A PASSENGER IN MY SEAT.    THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS SHUTTING OFF WHILE IN MOTION AND POWERING STEERING IS LOST. IF THIS HAPPENS ON THE HIGHWAY GOING 60+ MILES PER HOUR, OR TURNING INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC, THERE IS A GUARANTEED ACCIDENT, POSSIBLY RESULTING IN SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.    I BELIEVE THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE GAS TANK AND THE EVAP CANISTER THAT CAUSES THE SENSORS TO THINK THAT GAS IS OVERFILLING THE ENGINE, WHICH SHUTS OFF THE CAR.

SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE CALLED THE LOCAL CHRYSLER (PORT JEFF CHRYSLER JEEP DODGE) DEALERSHIP ON AT LEAST 4 OCCASIONS TO SCHEDULE THE AIRBAG REPLACEMENT. THE FIRST 2 CALLS WERE MADE SOMETIME LATE SUMMER / EARLY FALL 2016, A THIRD CALL WAS MADE ON DEC 2, 2016, AND A 4TH CALL WAS MADE ON FEB 17, 2017. DURING THIS LAST PHONE CONVERSATION (FEB 17) THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME \"WE HAVE NO IDEA WHEN WE ARE GETTING THE PARTS\".

I AM JUST CONCERNED THAT ONE OF THE MORE CRITICAL SAFETY FEATURES IN A VEHICLE IS TAKING SO LONG TO CORRECT. PLEASE ADVISE IF THIS IS AN ACCEPTABLE TIME FRAME FOR THE RECALL TO BE CORRECTED.

I ENDED UP HAVING TO GET THE CAR TOWED TO MY LOCAL MACHINE SHOP. MY MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT A VALVE SEAT DROPPED AND THE ENGINE NEEDED REPLACEMENT. MY MECHANIC WAS QUITE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS. AS HE STATED THAT IT HAPPENED VERY OFTEN WITH DODGE HEMI 5.7 ENGINES. HE STATED THAT THE VALVE SEATS WERE MADE OF POOR METAL MATERIAL. HE ALSO STATED THAT CHRYSLER WAS VERY AWARE OF THE DEFECT AND WHAT IT CAN CAUSE.  I DID MY RESEARCH ONLINE AND FOUND HUNDREDS OF THREADS WITH PEOPLE THAT EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I HAD TO BUY  A BRAND NEW ENGINE AND SEVERAL OTHER ENGINE PARTS THAT FAILED DUE TO THIS CATASTROPHE. NOT TO MENTION MAJOR LABOR COSTS.  *TR",

I HAD IT TOWED TO MY MECHANIC WHO SAID THERE WAS NO COMPRESSION ON CYLINDER #3 AND THE VALVE WAS UNSEATED CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE CYLINDER.     I TAKE METICULOUS CARE OF MY VEHICLE AND THIS TYPE OF ENGINE FAILURE SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED WITH ONLY 105K MILES ON IT. UPON READING SEVERAL THOUSAND REVIEWS ON THIS 5.7L HEMI ENGINE, THIS APPEARS TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM AND HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT. THE BELOW IS THE DIAGNOSIS FOR THIS EARLY ENGINE FAILURE:    \"FAULTY VALVE SEATS  ACCORDING TO THE ENGINE COMPANY, THE ORIGINAL CHRYSLER DESIGN PRESSES THE VALVE SEATS INTO THE CYLINDER HEADS. THE PROBLEM RESULTS WHEN THE POWDERED METAL THE VALVE SEATS ARE MADE OF EXPANDS, CAUSING IT TO DROP INTO CONTACT WITH THE VALVE AND PISTONS, WHICH LEADS TO CATASTROPHIC FAILURE. IN THIS PROCESS THE SEAT BREAKS INTO MANY PIECES CAUSING DETERIORATION OF THE PISTON, CYLINDER WALL, VALVE AND CYLINDER HEAD.  THIS METAL CAN EVEN GET INTO THE INTAKE MANIFOLD ' IF NOT CLEANED PROPERLY, IT CAN LEAD TO A FAILURE IN REPLACEMENT ENGINES.  PISTON RING LANDINGS  AGAIN ACCORDING TO PP, A FLAW IN THE ENGINEERING OF THE PISTON RING LANDINGS RESULTS IN THE ENGINES RUNNING MUCH HOTTER THAN THEY SHOULD. COUPLED WITH WHAT THEY CALL OVERLY SMALL DRAIN HOLES IN THE HEADS AND BLOCK, THIS OVERHEATING BREAKS DOWN NEW OIL, LEAVING SLUDGE IN THE ENGINE, ULTIMATELY BLOCKING IT. CONSEQUENT OIL-STARVATION CAN LEAD TO ENGINE BLOCK SEIZURE.\"",

I'VE NEVER HAD ISSUES LIKE THIS WITH MY CAR BUT NOW AS I'M RESEARCHING FOR DIY RESOLUTIONS I'M FINDING THAT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO HAVE HAD SIMILAR ISSUES. THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED IMMEDIATELY. I'M NOW OUT OF MONEY. I HAVE 5 CHILDREN AND AM THE ONLY ONE IN MY HOUSE WORKING AND THIS IS MY ONLY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION THAT I AM STILL PAYING A NOTE ON. BY THE WAY, TRIED TO START MY CAR AGAIN AND ITS STILL DOING THE SAME EFFING THING. CHRYSLER NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING FAST!!!",

I PUT THE VEHICLE IN PARK AND ATTEMPTED TO START. I WAS ABLE TO GET IT STARTED AND MOVING BEFORE THE LIGHT CHANGED BUT NOT SOON ENOUGH.  I EVEN PUT FLASHERS ON SO DRIVERS BEHIND ME WOULD KNOW I WASN'T GETTING ANYWHERE ON FIRST ATTEMPT AT MOVING.  (THIS OCCURRED 2 DAYS PRIOR WHILE WAITING IN LINE OF TRAFFIC---TWICE IN THE PARKING LOT.

I WAS IN A SITUATION WHERE I WAS COMING TO A LIGHT, THE RPM'S STARTED TO DROP AND THE ENGINE STARTED TO DIE AS I WAS BREAKING. THEN THE CAR REVVED BACK TO LIFE AND THIS CAUSE THE RPM'S TO SHOOT UP JOLTING THE VEHICLE FORWARD. IMMEDIATELY AFTER IT DIED YET AGAIN HOWEVER THE ISSUE IS I LOST ALL POWER, STEERING, BRAKES, EVERYTHING. FROM THE JOLT FORWARD I CAME DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO REAR ENDING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME WITH A HEAVY BRAKE PEDAL. AT THIS POINT I WAS JARRED A BIT, AND NEEDED TO GET THE CAR GOING AGAIN. I WENT TO START IT AND IT DID NO'T WANT TO TURN OVER FOR ROUGHLY 30 SECONDS. THE LIGHT CHANGED AND THERE WAS A LINEUP OF DISGRUNTLED DRIVERS BEHIND ME AS I MADE EFFORTS TO GET GOING AGAIN. THEN INEVITABLY THE VEHICLE DIED YET AGAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION AND WENT THROUGH THE SAME SITUATION. TO NEGATE THIS, I HAVE MADE EFFORTS TO NOT FILL THE TANK. NOW THE BIGGER ISSUE I AM HAVING IS THAT WHEN I GO TO PUT GAS IN THE CAR, IT DOES NOT TAKE. I CANNOT GET A GALLON IN WITHOUT THE PUMP CLICKING OFF. IT TAKES ME QUITE SOME TIME, 10 MINUTES EVEN TO SIMPLY PUT $20 IN THE CAR, AND I GET VERY FRUSTRATED GAS ATTENDANTS HERE IN JERSEY IF I'M NOT PERMITTED TO DO MAN THE PUMP. YOU NEED TO LITERALLY STAND WITH IT AND CONTINUE TO RESET THE PUMP AS IT SLOWLY TAKES AND CONTINUOUSLY CLICKS OFF. THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE SOLVED, IT I'S SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE AND DANGEROUS. I HAVE MANY OTHER INSTANCES & DATES WITH STALLING AND JOLTING ISSUES AFTER FILLUP. EVEN WHEN I LEAVE A 1/4 OF THE TANK EMPTY, I STILL GET SOME SYMPTOMS. NOT AS OFTEN, BUT THE CAR STILL DOES DIE OUT. NOW THAT IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO FILL, IT IS INCONVENIENT TO DRIVE. I LOVE THE CAR BUT THE ISSUES ARE ALMOST NOT WORTH IT, ESPECIALLY WITH HOW THIRSTY THE SRT IS-NO PUN THANKS  *TR",

THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME, THEY GET A FUEL TANK IN EVERY 15 DAYS OR SO FOR REPAIRS INVOLVING THIS ISSUE.  THE OWNERS ARE NOT AWARE OF THE DANGER THIS CAN CAUSE WHILE MERGING INTO TRAFFIC.  THE VEHICLE'S POWER AND FUEL JUST SHUTS OFF WITH NO WARNING TO OTHER DRIVERS. THIS RESULTED IN A VEHICLE SWAYING AROUND ME INTO TRAFFIC AVOIDING A REAR COLLISION; BECAUSE OF COURSE I HAD NO BRAKE LIGHTS THAT ILLUMINATED.     *TR",

THEY WROTE TO LET ME KNOW THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF A FAULTY FUEL SHUT-OFF FLOAT IN MY GAS TANK THAT WILL CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO STALL. I CALLED TO SCHEDULE THE REPAIR AND WAS TOLD THAT CHRYSLER IS ONLY SENDING OUT ONE FUEL TANK PER DEALERSHIP PER WEEK AND THAT I WAS 7TH IN LINE TO HAVE MY WORK PERFORMED. SO THAT MEANT THAT I WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE A VEHICLE THAT WAS CONTINUALLY CUTTING OFF FOR 2 MONTHS EVEN BEFORE THEY WOULD FIX IT. I CALLED CHRYSLER TO INQUIRE WHY IT WOULD TAKE SO LONG TO FIX A PROBLEM THAT THEY KNOW IS CAUSING NUMEROUS VEHICLES TO CUT OFF AND THEY SAID THAT THE PARTS ARE ON BACKORDER. I INDICATED TO THEM THAT I HAD COME CLOSE TO HAVING NUMEROUS ACCIDENTS BECAUSE MY VEHICLE WAS STALLING IN TRAFFIC AND YET THEY DIDNT SEEM TO CARE ONE IOTA. AFTER WAITING 2 MONTHS FOR MY TIME IN LINE TO COME AROUND I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP TO SEE WHEN THE WORK WOULD BE ABLE TO BE DONE AND WAS TOLD THAT I WAS NEXT IN LINE BUT THE PART WAS STILL ON BACKORDER AND COULD NOT HAVE MY VEHICLE FIXED YET. THEY COULD NOT GIVE ME AN ESTIMATE AS TO WHEN THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THE PARTS IN. I FIND IT VERY HARD TO FATHOM THAT A MAJOR AUTOMAKER SUCH AS CHRYSLER/DODGE, KNOWING ABOUT A PROBLEM WITH THEIR VEHICLES THAT ARE CAUSING THEM TO SHUT OFF IN TRAFFIC AND ARE NOT EXPEDITING THE PROCESS OF HAVING THOSE VEHICLES FIXED. I HAVE BEEN VERY LUCKY THUS FAR BY NOT HAVING A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT DUE TO MY CAR STALLING BUT I FEAR THAT SOMEONE ELSE MAY NOT BE SO LUCKY AND THAT SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE SERIOUSLY HURT. THERE ARE NUMEROUS VEHICLES LIKE MINE ON THE ROAD WITH THE SAME PROBLEM AND ITS A SHAME THAT SOMEONE HAS TO RISK SERIOUS INJURY DUE TO CHRYSLER'S INABILITY TO DO WHATS RIGHT.  *TR",

WE REPLACED THE GAS TANK YESTERDAY, FILLED THE GAS TANK, AND HAD NO STALLING OR HESITATION.  SO, IT APPEARS THAT THE PROBLEM IS FIXED.  HOWEVER, I COULD ENVISION A NUMBER OF SITUATIONS WHERE ONE COULD BE IN A LIFE-THREATENING SITUATION IF THE CAR DIED IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION OR IN HEAVY TRAFFIC ON THE INTERSTATE.  SINCE THIS APPEARS TO BE A WELL-KNOWN PROBLEM I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THERE HAS NOT BEEN A RECALL.  *TR",

IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT 20 MINUTES BECAUSE THE NOZZLE WOULD SHUT OFF. I COULD ONLY PUT IN VERY SMALL AMOUNTS EACH SQUEEZE OF THE HANDLE. I FIND THIS NOT ONLY ANNOYING BUT ALSO QUESTION THE DESIGN OF THE WHOLE FUEL RECEIVING AND STORAGE SYSTEM OF THIS VEHICLE. I HAVE ASKED MY LOCAL DODGE DEALERSHIP ABOUT THE PROBLEMS AND WAS ADVISED THAT A NEW GAS TANK WOULD HAVE TO BE INSTALLED FOR APPROXIMATELY $1,200! A NEW GAS TANK? THAT WOULD CONFIRM IN MY MIND THAT THESE PROBLEMS ARE CAUSED ABSOLUTELY BY A DESIGN FLAW AND SHOULD BE RECALLED AND REPAIRED ASAP BEFORE THERE ARE FATALITIES LINKED TO THIS FLAW.",

AFTER 6 YEARS OF FILLING UP MY CAR BY LETTING THE GAS PUMP STOP AUTOMATICALLY WITH NO ISSUES; THE CAR BEGAN TO STALL RIGHT AFTER FILLING-UP WHEN TOPPING OFF THE TANK, STARTING AROUND MAY OF 2012.      I CALLED AUTONATION DODGE IN ROSEVILLE, CALIFORNIA AND THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN WAS FAMILIAR WITH MY ISSUE.  HE ASKED IF I HAD FILLED UP THE TANK BY TOPPING IT OFF.  I TOLD HIM, AFFIRMATIVE.  HE ADVISED ME TO NOT TOP OFF THE TANK AT ALL DURING FILL-UPS OR TO BUY A NEW FUEL TANK AT THE COST OF $2000-3000 WITH INSTALLATION.      FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS, I'VE BEEN LUCKY TO NOT TOP OFF THE FUEL TANK, BUT IT HAS OCCURRED AT LEAST 4 TIMES WHEN I MADE THE MISTAKE OF TOPPING OFF THE GAS.  THE LAST TIME THIS OCCURRED WAS YESTERDAY.  AFTER BUYING GAS AND HAVING THE PUMP STOP AUTOMATICALLY, I DROVE INTO A MAJOR INTERSECTION AND STOPPED AT THE RED LIGHT.  THE CAR TURNED OFF, AND IT TOOK ABOUT 3 TRIES OF RE-STARTING THE IGNITION IN PARK BEFORE THE CAR LUCKILY POWERED ON AGAIN.  WHEN MY LIGHT TURNED GREEN, THE CAR WOULD JUMP AND LOSE POWER WHILE SHIFTING INTO SECOND AND THIRD GEARS.  I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO NOT HAVE ANY CARS BEHIND ME, BECAUSE THIS ISSUE OF THE CAR STALLING COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  THIS STALLING HAZARD HAPPENED AGAIN YESTERDAY ON MY WAY HOME AND ALSO THIS MORNING.    I FEEL CHRYSLER/FIAT SHOULD REPLACE ALL EFFECTED 2006 DODGE CHARGER R/TS WITH THIS ISSUE BY REPLACING THE TANK OR WHATEVER REPAIR IT WOULD TAKE TO FIX THIS SAFETY HAZARD.  I FEEL THAT MOST OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE WON'T BE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE UNTIL IT HAPPENS TO THEM PERSONALLY.  IT SHOULD BE MANDATORY FOR CHRYSLER/FIAT TO ISSUE A RECALL WITH ALL EXPENSES COVERED BY THE MANUFACTURER.  *TR",

TO MY SURPRISE I DIDN'T HAVE A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT SO I SAT THERE FOR A WHILE REVVING THE ENGINE AND EVEN SHUT IT OFF AND RESTARTED IT, EVERYTHING SEEMED FINE SO I WENT ON MY WAY. SHORTLY AFTER I DROVE OFF IT HAPPENED AGAIN AND THIS TIME I WAS JUST DRIVING STRAIGHT. FROM THE GAS STATION TO MY HOME IS ABOUT 10MIN AND IN THAT SHORT TIME FRAME THE VEHICLE RANDOMLY STALLED 4 TIMES! THIS WENT ON FOR A FEW DAYS UNTIL MY FUEL LVL WAS ABOUT 3/4 FULL? AFTER RESEARCHING ONLINE ON DODGE FORUMS I WAS ABLE TO FIND OUT WHAT MAY AND MOST LIKELY BE THE ISSUE WITH MY VEHICLE. SOME SAY ITS A COLLAPSED GAS TANK WHICH AFFECTS A CHECK VALVE IN THE GAS TANK THAT IS FOR THE EVAP SYSTEM. WHEN YOU HAVE A FULL TANK AND THE SYSTEM OPENS UP TO RELEASE GAS VAPORS BACK INTO THE ENGINE IT'S ACTUALLY SENDING RAW FUEL BACK INTO THE ENGINE WHICH IN TURN FLOODS THE VEHICLE AND CAUSES THE STALL. OF COURSE THIS PART CAN'T BE REPLACED OR FIXED SINCE THE TANK AND THOSE PARTS ARE SOLD AS ONE PIECE WHICH IS BIG $$$! MY ONLY FIX FOR THIS UNTIL THIS IS RECALLED IS I DON'T GET A FULL TANK ANYMORE. THIS IS A SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS ISSUE WHICH SHOULD BE RECALLED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE SOMEONE GETS INTO A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.   *TR",

THIS MORNING THE CAR FAILED TO START.  AFTER ABOUT 6 ATTEMPTS, I FLOORED THE ACCELERATOR WHILE CRANKING AND THE CAR STARTED.  AFTER PULLING OUT OF THE PARKING LOT WHERE I WAS PARKED AND ONTO THE HIGHWAY, HE CAR SPUTTERED/HESITATED 4 TIMES (KIND OF LIKE A BUCKING BRONCO) ABOUT 70 YARDS DOWN THE ROAD, WITH TRAFFIC CATCHING UP TO ME AND THEN IT SETTLED BACK TO ITS NORMAL SELF.  ABOUT 3 WEEKS AGO, WHILE TRAVELING THROUGH TENNESSEE, I FUELED UP, PULLED INTO THE STREET AND APPROACHED A RED LIGHT AND I STOPPED AT WHICH TIME THE CAR DID ITS HESITATION AND STALLED.

ON 08/01/13 I FILLED UP MY GAS TANK WITHOUT TOPPING IT OFF, GOT ON THE HIGHWAY DROVE ABOUT 16 MILES AGAIN AND EXITED, AS I WAS MAKING A LEFT TURN THE CAR STALLED OUT AGAIN AND IT DID THAT TWO MORE TIMES AS I WAS DRIVING IT TO THE DEALERSHIP. THIS TIME MY ADVISER TOLD ME TO ONLY FILL UP 3/4 OF A TANK.THE COST FOR THIS REPAIR IS RIDICULOUS AND THE CUSTOMERS WHO PAID 30K TO 45K FOR THESE CARS SHOULD NOT BE STUCK WITH THE BILL. THERE SHOULD BE A URGENT RECALL ON ALL OF THESE CARS BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT OR TURN'S INTO ROAD KILL ON THE HIGHWAY.  *TR",

THE CAR WAS TOWED TO A CERTIFIED MECHANIC WHO STATED THAT THE ENGINE HAD BLOWN A VALVE AND THE ENTIRE ENGINE WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED.

I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THE SAME THING, THEY SAID THAT THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING. THEY SAID THEY WOULD KEEP MY VEHICLE AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON, IF THEY DON'T FIND ANYTHING THAN THEY WOULD KEEP IT AND TRY TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND I COULD BE WITHOUT MY CAR UNTIL THEY FIGURE IT OUT. SINCE THE FIRST INCIDENT IT HAS HAPPENED AT LEASE 10 MORE TIMES. I RESEARCHED IT ONLINE AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE CASES OF THIS HAPPENING WITH CHRYSLER VEHICLES. THERE IS NOW AN INVESTIGATION ONGOING BUT UNTIL THEN MANY OWNERS HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM OR GO WITHOUT THEIR VEHICLE. MANY HAVE SAID THAT IT HAPPENED AFTER REFUELING THEIR CAR, FOR ME IT HAS HAPPENED A COUPLE OF TIMES AFTER REFUELING, BUT MULTIPLE TIMES WHILE IT WAS AT 1/2 AND 1/4 TANK. A REALLY BAD ACCIDENT TO INCLUDE SERIOUS INJURIES AND OR DEATH TO THE DRIVER CAN HAPPEN AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN THEN?

TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP, TECHNICIAN SAID THEIR DIAGNOSTIC MACHINE COULDN'T FIND ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE BATTERY,ALTERNATOR NOR ANY OF ELECTRICAL PARTS. I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH MY CAR PRIOR TO HAVING THE ABOVE SERVICES DONE.

        "summary": "THIS PROBLEM IS RELATED TO THE PURGE SOLENOID. THE EVAPORATIVE EMISSIONS SYSTEM STORES FUEL VAPORS FROM THE TANK AND THEN BURNS THEM IN THE ENGINE, TO KEEP THE VAPORS FROM GOING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. WHEN YOU FILL THE TANK WITH FUEL THE AIR AND VAPOR THAT THE FUEL DISPLACES HAS TO GO INTO THE EVAP SYSTEM. THERE IS A VALVE ON TOP OF THE TANK THAT ALLOWS THE VAPOR OUT, BUT IS SUPPOSED TO SHUT OFF WHEN LIQUID FUEL HITS IT AS THE TANK FILLS. WHAT HAPPENS IS THIS VALVE FAILS AND IT ALLOWS YOU TO PUSH LIQUID FUEL INTO THE EVAP SYSTEM WHEN YOU PUSH TOO MUCH FUEL INTO THE TANK. THIS LIQUID FUEL GOES INTO THE VAPOR CANISTER AND LINES. WHEN YOU START THE ENGINE A COUPLE MINUTES LATER THE PURGE SOLENOID WILL COME ON TO DO IT'S JOB AND BURN THESE VAPORS, BUT WITH THIS FAILED VALVE IT SUCKS UP LIQUID FUEL INSTEAD, SO THE ENGINE RUNS ROUGH AND CAN DIE AT IDLE. THE VEHICLE STALLS FOR THE NEXT 5 MILES OR SO WHENEVER YOU TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE GAS, I.E. TAKING A TURN OR SITTING AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT. THE VEHICLE BUCKS VIOLENTLY AS WELL. WHEN THE ENGINE STALLS IT CUTS ALL POWER TO THE VEHICLE CAUSING YOU TO LOSE POWER STEERING AND THE ABS. BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS VAPOR LOCKED IT WILL NOT RESTART IMMEDIATELY. MY FEAR IS THAT I AM GOING TO PULL INTO TRAFFIC AND BE INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT WHEN MY VEHICLE STALLS AND WILL NOT RESTART OR I'LL BE INJURED WHEN IT HAPPENS TAKING A CURVE OR TURN. CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER SAYS THEY HAVE NO SERVICE BULLETINS ON THIS ISSUE AND NO ONE ELSE HAS COMPLAINED ABOUT. A QUICK INTERNET SEARCH (DODGE CHARGER STALL AFTER FILLING WITH GAS) SHOWS IT IS A WIDE SPREAD ISSUE NOT ONLY WITH THE CHARGER BUT THE MAGNUM AND CHRYSLER 300 AS WELL. ONLY WAY TO FIX ISSUE IS TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE GAS TANK WHICH IS A $900 PART WITH 2-3 HOURS LABOR.  *TR",

THIS ALL CONTINUES TO HAPPEN UNTIL THE GAS LEVEL IN THE TANK DROPS DOWN SOME AFTER DRIVING FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS OR IF THE GAS CAP IS LEFT LOOSE. WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE EVAP VENT ON THE FUEL TANK DETERIORATES AND EVENTUALLY ALLOWS FUEL TO PASS THREW IT INTO THE PURGE SOLENOID AND THEN INTO THE INTAKE ON THE MOTOR. THIS EXTRA FUEL BEING DUMPED INTO THE MOTOR CAUSES IT TO REV UP AND JERK FORWARD WHEN THIS OCCURS. SO EVERY TIME THE EVAP PURGE SOLENOID COMES ON IT WILL SUCK GAS INTO THE MOTOR INSTEAD OF VAPORS. THIS EXTRA FUEL IS LIKE HITTING THE GAS PEDAL EACH TIME. LEAVING THE CAP LOOSE WON'T LET THE SYSTEM SEAL AND WORK AS DESIGNED, IT'S A CRUTCH TO AVOID THE PROBLEM.

APPARENTLY THIS IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF BUT DO NOT WANT TO FIX THE PROBLEM OR RECALL IT TO HAVE IT FIXED.  FROM WHAT I HAVE BEEN READING ON THE INTERNET THE PROBLEM IS OCCURRING IN THE FUEL TANK, WHERE THE FUEL CONTROL VALVE ON TOP OF THE FUEL TANK (ONLY SERVICED WITH THE TANK), FAILS AND ALLOWS RAW LIQUID FUEL TO ENTER THE EVAP SYSTEM.  A SHORT TIME AFTER START UP, THE PCM ACTUATES THE PURGE SOLENOID TO PURGE THE VAPORS FROM THE CANISTER.  SINCE THERE IS RAW FUEL IN THE CANISTER AND LINES, THE RESULT IS AN OVERLY RICH MIXTURE THAT FLOODS THE ENGINE, CAUSING THE ENGINE TO STALL.

UPON ENTERING A HIGH WAY AND ATTEMPTING TO MERGE WITH TRAFFIC DURING MORNING RUSH HOUR, MY CAR LOST ALL POWER UPON ACCELERATION. THE ENGINE DID NOT STALL BUT THE TACHOMETER DROPPED TO NEAR ZERO, THE ENGINE LIGHT AND POWER LIGHT FLASHED BRIEFLY AND THEN RETURNED TO NORMAL. I ATTEMPTED TO ACCELERATE AGAIN AND SAME THING HAPPENED. FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO AVOID A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ACCIDENT WITH THE  CARS BEHIND ME AND THE ONES I WAS MERGING ON TO THE HIGHWAY WITH. THE SYMPTOMS DISAPPEARED FOR A FEW WEEKS AND THEN STARTED AGAIN AND PROGRESSIVELY BECAME WORSE. I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALER THAT INVESTIGATED AND FOUND IT TO BE THE POWER CONTROL MODULE WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE QUITE EXPENSIVE. I DID SOME RESEARCH ON A FORUM THAT I BELONG TO AND FOUND MANY INSTANCES OF THIS. CONTACTED CHRYSLER AND SIMPLY PUT THEY DID NOT SEEM TO CARE. THERE ARE MANY DEFECTS ON THIS YEAR OF CHARGER AND NOT ONE OF THEM HAS EVER BEEN COVERED, AT LEAST THE ONES THAT I HAVE. I CONSIDER THIS LATEST INCIDENT TO BE SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM AND HOPE THAT IT GETS INVESTIGATED. AS FOR ANOTHER CHRYSLER PRODUCT, NEVER AGAIN IN MY LIFETIME. I RELY ON MY VEHICLE FOR WORK AND THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST THAT I HAVE EVER OWNED. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS BEFORE SOMEONE HAS TO START CHECKING OFF ACCIDENT AND DEATH WHEN SUBMITTING A FORM.  *TR",

THE PIECE THAT BROKE IS A PATHETIC BRIGHT PINK PIECE OF PLASTIC THAT IS AS CHEAP AS A TOY FROM THE DOLLAR STORE, AND I AM NOT EXAGGERATING. IT'S PATHETIC. IT'S UNSAFE, IT'S NOT RIGHT, AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE. ASAP. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT NO ONE HAS ISSUED A RECALL OR SAFETY CALL ON THIS. THERE ARE SEVERAL VERY REPUTABLE WEBSITES THAT SELL THE CHEAP PIECE THAT'S BROKEN BECAUSE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE REPORTING THIS BROKEN. SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG HERE. FUNNY'THE PIECE I'M REFERRING TO COSTS $49.99 TO REPLACE, AND IS MADE OUT OF METAL. DODGE REPLACES IT WITH THE SAME PLASTIC, WHICH BREAKS A YEAR LATER. AND, THEY CHARGE $450 TO DO IT, AS THEY REPLACE THE ENTIRE SHIFT KIT. SAD. I'VE CONTACTED THE WEBSITE SEVERAL TIMES, AND THEY PROVIDED A LOT OF HELP. DODGE; NONE.  *TR",

WHEN I TURN IT RIGHT BACK ON IT DOESN'T DO IT- THIS HAPPENS SOMETIMES WHEN I PULL INTO THE GARAGE AND IT SITS IN IDLE.  - SOMETIMES ALL DASH LIGHTS JUST GO OUT WITHOUT WARNING- VARIOUS SPEEDS  - RECENTLY (4-20-11) ALL DASH LIGHTS CAME ON, KEY CHIME KEPT CHIMING AND ENGINE BEGAN TO FALTER AND WOULD NOT ALLOW ACCELERATION...AT ALL.

FROM DRIVEWAY INTO GARAGE AND SHUTTING OFF THE ENGINE, AFTER CAR HAS SAT FOR SEVERAL HOURS WITHOUT THE ENGINE RUNNING; AND WITH A FULL TANK OR 1/4 OR LESS OF GAS. HAS OCCURRED A COUPLE OF TIMES UPON ACCELERATION, BUT ALMOST ALWAYS OCCURS WHEN THE CAR COMES TO A STOP.THE ONE TIME I SMELLED IT THE STRONGEST THOUGH WAS AFTER I BACKED INTO A PARKING SPACE. I HAD BEEN IN ANOTHER SPACE WITH THE ENGINE OFF FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES. I STARTED THE CAR AND BACKED INTO A SPACE FURTHER DOWN IN THE LOT, SHUT THE ENGINE OFF, AND THE ODOR OF RAW GAS WAS VERY STRONG AND SEEMED TO BE RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE DRIVER'S DOOR WHEN I OPENED IT. PASSENGERS IN CAR HAVE ALSO SMELLED IT.  MYSELF AND 2 OTHER PEOPLE HAVE INSPECTED THE VEHICLE UNDER THE HOOD, AND UNDERNEATH WHILE IT WAS ON A LIFT, BUT COULD NOT LOCATE ANY LEAKS, BROKEN OR CRACKED HOSES, ETC. I TOOK IT TO A DODGE DEALERSHIP ON 2/8/11 AND THEY COULD NOT FIND THE CAUSE OF IT EITHER. HOWEVER, IT NEVER OCCURRED ON THE WAY TO THE DEALER. IT WAS IN THE 20S THAT MORNING AND I HAD BETWEEN 1/2 AND 3/4 OF A TANK OF GAS; NORMALLY \"IDEAL\" CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH IT OCCURS. PROBLEM DID NOT OCCUR UNTIL LATER THAT MORNING AFTER LEAVING THE DEALERSHIP. I ADVISED THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE ADVISER OF ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH IT OCCURS, ON A TYPED DOCUMENT WHICH I GAVE TO HIM.  MY MAIN CONCERN IS THAT SINCE IT IS THE GASOLINE FUMES THAT ARE COMBUSTIBLE, THAT IT WILL EVENTUALLY CAUSE A FIRE. ALSO, THERE ARE ABOUT A DOZEN OTHER DODGE CHARGER OWNERS WHO BELONG TO A CHARGER OWNERS' WEB SITE, WWW.CHARGERFORUMS.COM, WHO HAVE POSTED THE SAME COMPLAINT AND NEITHER THEY NOR DEALERSHIPS HAVE FOUND A CAUSE FOR IT EITHER. *TR",

FROM THE BLAST MY NECK JERKED VERY HARD AND I AM EXPERIENCING DIZZY NESS FROM THE EXPLOSION AND BATTERY ACID FUMES AND MINOR BACK PAINS.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT MY LEGAL RIGHTS OR AND OPTION TO GET THIS ISSUE RESOLVED.  AT THIS TIME MY CAR IS COMPLETELY DAMAGED I HAVE NO ELECTRICAL POWER AT THIS TIME AND MY FRONT WINDSHIELD WAS CRACKED.  I HAVE NO TRANSPORTATION WANTED TO SEE IF DODGE WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS ELECTRICAL SYSTEM BATTERY DEFECT WHICH ALMOST CAUSE ME MY LIFE. *TR",

AFTER MUCH RESEARCH I HAVE FOUND THAT THIS IS A RECURRING PROBLEM WITH CHARGERS, OLD AND NEW, AND ONE THAT MANY OTHER OWNERS SUFFER.  A CHRYSLER REP TOLD ME THEY WERE AWARE OF A STALL PROBLEM, BUT SAID THAT SINCE THEY DON'T KNOW THE EXACT CAUSE, THERE IS NOTHING THEY WILL DO UNLESS THE CUSTOMER PAYS FOR EXPENSIVE AND EXPERIMENTAL DIAGNOSES.  WHY IS IT UP TO THE CONSUMER TO FIND A KNOWN PROBLEM THAT COULD KILL MOTORISTS?  WHEN DO THEY INTEND TO ADDRESS IT?  AFTER A FAMILY IS WIPED OUT?    THIS IS A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN.

ADDITIONALLY, MY VEHICLE WOULD AT TIMES SEEM TO BE STUCK IN IDLE WHEN I WAS TRYING TO ACCELERATE.  MY VEHICLE HAS BEEN IN THE DEALERSHIP REPAIR SHOP 5 DIFFERENT TIMES FOR THIS ISSUE.  I WAS TOLD TWICE THAT THE COMPUTER CHIP NEEDED TO BE REPROGRAMMED.  TWO OTHER TIMES I WAS TOLD THE ISSUE WAS RELATED TO BRAKE ISSUES AND THAT MY BRAKES NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  I AM FILING THIS COMPLAINT BECAUSE MY VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY NOT UNDER WARRANTY, MEANING A SERVICE CHARGE EVERYTIME I TAKE IT IN, AND ONCE AGAIN THE ISSUE HAS GONE TO THE POINT WHERE I NEED TO TAKE IT ONE MORE TIME.  I HAVE CONTACTED THE MANUFACTURER TWICE ON THIS ISSUE, ONCE IN 2007 AND AGAIN RECENTLY, TO NO RESOLVE.  I HAVE TALKED TO ONE OTHER CHARGER (2007)OWNER WHO INDICATED THEY HAVE A SIMILAR ISSUE.  THE ISSUE ONLY OCCURS PERIODICALLY, BUT PREVENTS ME FROM TRAVELING LONG DISTANCES IN MY VEHICLE FOR FEAR OF IRREPARABLE DAMAGE.  I FEEL AS MY LAST OPTION IS TO FILE THIS COMPLAINT. *TR",

ON TUESDAY, NOV 27, 2007 I DROVE ABOUT 60 MILES TO CINCINNATI FOR A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT AND TO TAKE AN ELDERLY FRIEND TO LUNCH.  AFTER I ARRIVED WITH IN THE 275 BY-PASS LOOP I TRAVELED MOSTLY ON LOCAL ROADS AT SPEEDS OF 30-45 PMH.  WHEN RETURNING MY FRIEND TO HER APARTMENT FOR SOME REASON I DID NOT HOP IN THE FREEWAY, WHICH I USUALLY DO.  I TOOK A CROSS CUT ROAD THAT I HAD NOT TAKEN FOR OVER A YEAR.   AS I PULLED INTO THE APARTMENT PARKING SPACE THE CAR SEEMED TO BE STRAINING AS IF THE BRAKE WERE ON.  WHEN I BACKED UP TO LEAVE, THE CAR BARELY MOVED.  I GOT OUT AND WALKED AROUND THE CAR BUT SAW NOTHING UNUSUAL.  I AGAIN TRIED TO BACK OUT WITH THE SAME DIFFICULTY.  I THEN DECIDED I WOULD DRIVE THE CAR AROUND THE PARKING LOT BEFORE I ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE ON THE HIGHWAY.  WHEN I AGAIN BACKED UP THERE WAS A CLANG.  THIS TIME WHEN I WALKED AROUND THE CAR THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE WAS AT A SHARP ANGLE BUT THE OTHER THREE TIRES WERE NOT.  I LOOKED UNDER THE CAR BEHIND THIS WHEEL AND  SAW THE PROBLEM.  THE TIE ROD WAS HANGING DOWN ON THE ASPHALT.  I DID NOT MOVE THE CAR AGAIN AND IMMEDIATELY CALLED FOR A TOW TRUCK FROM MY HOME TOWN.  WHEN CHECKED, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CONNECTOR FOR THE TIE ROD (TO THE WHEEL) HAD WORN DOWN.  THE OTHER FRONT WHEEL WAS CHECKED AND THE SAME WEAR WAS FOUND.  I HAD BOTH REPLACED AND HAVE THE TWO DAMAGED TIE RODS.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, I WAS VERY RELIEVED THAT I WAS NOT DRIVING AT A HIGH SPEED.   BECAUSE MY CAR IS A 2006, THIS SEEMS TO BE AN UNUSUAL SITUATION.  IT COULD EXPLAIN WHY I HAD TO REPLACE ALL 4 TIRES AT AROUND 34,000 MILES.

I KEPT DRIVING RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS WITH NO OTHER CARS PRESENT AND AGAIN WHEN I CAME TO STOP AT A STOP SIGN THE SQUEAL WAS PRESENT. I ONLY SEEMED TO GET THE SQUEAL WHEN SLOWING TO A STOP. ALSO THE BRAKES SOMETIMES MAKE A MOANING SOUND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU COME TO SLOW DOWN. GOOD EXAMPLE IS IF YOU ARE BACKING INTO A PARKING SPACE AND PRESS THE GAS TOO MUCH, YOU NATURALLY PRESS THE BRAKE TO STOP AND THEN WILL EASE OFF OF IT. I GET THE MOANING SOUND GOING IN REVERSE MOTION AND FORWARD MOTION. I LET ME DEALER KNOW WHO SAID THAT MY VEHICLE WAS PAST 12,000 AND THAT I WOULD SIMPLY HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.

THE SERVICE WRITER TOLD ME THAT THEY TRIED TO TURN THE ROTORS AND WHEN THEY DID THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH METAL LEFT FOR SAFE BRAKING. THEY REPLACED THE ROTORS, WITH THE SAME KIND THAT WAS ON THE VEHICLE WHEN I PURCHASED IT.

THEY GAVE ME A LOANER TO DRIVE WHILE THEY ATTEMPTED TO FIX IT.  ON AUGUST 9, THEY GAVE THE VEHICLE BACK TO ME.

ACCORDING TO NHTSA LAW:  HTTP://WWW.NHTSA.DOT.GOV/NCAP/AIRBAG...FRONTABS.HTM#5  VEHICLES WITH ADVANCED FRONTAL AIR BAGS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO SUPPRESS THE AIR BAGS (NOT ALLOW THEM TO DEPLOY) ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO HAVE AN INDICATOR LIGHT WITH THE PHRASE \"PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF\" OR \"PASS AIR BAG OFF\". WHEN ILLUMINATED, THE PURPOSE OF THIS INDICATOR LIGHT IS TO INFORM YOU THAT THE PASSENGER FRONTAL AIR BAG HAS BEEN AUTOMATICALLY TURNED OFF (SUPPRESSED) BY THE ADVANCED FRONTAL AIR BAG SYSTEM AND THEREFORE WILL NOT DEPLOY.

THE SERIOUS ISSUES THAT ARE OCCURRING WHEN IT IDLES, WHEN IT ACCELERATES AND WITH WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE SUSPENSION AND POSSIBLY BOTH THE ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION.  OF THOSE 68 DAYS, THEY HAVE COME TO PICK UP MY CAR ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS TO TRY AND FIX IT, THE LAST TIME (WHICH CONTINUES CURRENTLY) THEY HAVE HAD MY CAR FOR FOUR WEEKS.  I HAPPEN TO KNOW (UPON RESEARCHING AFTER THE PROLONGED PERIOD THEY HAVE HAD THE CAR) THAT TSB'S OR TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS HAVE BEEN ISSUED FOR EVERY PROBLEM THAT IS OCCURRING WITH MY CAR.  ADDITIONALLY, I HAVE TAKEN MY CAR TO TWO DIFFERENT MECHANICS (ONE DODGE DEALERSHIP AND ONE INDEPENDENT MECHANIC) THAT HAVE WITNESSED THESE MALFUNCTIONS.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT MY OPTIONS ARE LEGALLY FOR GETTING SOME KIND OF RESOLUTION. *JB",
