        "summary": "While driving on the freeway at 75 mph, the Adaptive Cruise Control was engaged, and when commnig up behind a slower moving truck in the slow lane, our car decelerated to match it's speed. I then went to pass the truck after several vehicles passed us on the left. As soon as I started to change lanes, the cruise control shut itself off and the car started to slow down with several more cars now right behind us in the fast lane. Once we were past the truck and back in the slow lane, I tried to re-engage the ACC, which refused to turn back on. It only gave a beep and showed an icon on the display that said ACC was off. (it was not off). The ACC would only start working again after we had gotten off the freeway and stoped the car. On this same trip, the ACC turned itself off, on about 6 or 7 different occasions. There was also a time when I was following a vehicle with ACC on, following at medium distance, and another vehicle sped past me on the left, and darted between our car and the one we had been following, and continued past that vehicle on the right side. As this other car passed between us and through, our car suddenly sped way up, forcing me to slam on the brakes so we wouldn't rear-end the vehicle in front of us.  At this point, I do not trust the ACC, or any of the Advanced Driver Assistance Systems in this car, and will NOT be using them unless Honda makes some fixes. (and even then, I will be wary) Prior to this trip, my wife was in the car, parked, with engine off, using the radio to listen to a pod-cast via her phone (plugged into the usb) and the car suddenly gave her a warning message that all of the Driver Assist functions were disabled, and to please see the dealer. We took it in, and they said there were known issues with some of the cameras and they would replace ours when they get one in. They still haven't got one in, however, everything started working again on it's own after the dealer had looked at it.",

Within 2nd day of ownership, the cruise control abruptly shut off causing a safety risk of driver's behind me coming close to rear end collision. The cruise control has abruptly and without warning has randomly shut off over 40 times since then. Vehicle has been taken in for repair 4 times with no resolve. Honda tried adjusting brake switch on first repair attempt, did not fix the issue. Second and third attempts the dealership replaced the SRS module and the brake switch. Drove vehicle for 800 miles, then the issue arose again, causing the car to immediately slow, causing others behind me to have to brake quickly putting me at risk of rear end collision. Opened a case with American Honda, case number12509879. American Honda and the dealership states \"they can not fix the issue until they actually see it for themselves acting up\", which it does not act up when they drive it. I have many, many videos of the cruise control randomly shutting off and me being unable to reengage the cruise control. The only solution so far is to pull off the roadway, shut the car off, restart it, cruise will activate then.

So Honda is putting me out for my time and money i give them for this faulty ACC and related safety systems.

This seems to be a widespread issue per owner forums for the 11th generation 2022 model Civics of all varieties.  I did not have the driver attention system on, was driving at night, and was not using adaptive cruise control.  I have not gone to a dealership yet because per others\u2019 experiences it has been a waste of time.  I am calling to let my dealer know of the issue and have them tell me when there is a solution.  The issue has just appeared for the first time, my car is at ~1,000 miles, and I\u2019ve had it for about 12 days.  I have done very little driving with cruise control but will do a significant amount now.  I believe this to be a safety issue.  No warning lights come on and I\u2019m order to reset cruise control, I needed to pull to the shoulder, restart the car, which is dangerous enough.",
