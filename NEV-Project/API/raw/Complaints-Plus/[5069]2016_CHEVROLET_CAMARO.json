After i put  it in for the warranty, my screen , dash, and all the sound went out in my vehicle.  The next day on November 27th my car battery drained out and i had to get it replaced. 2 days later  on November 29th 2021 my car battery went out again and had to get another battery. So at this point something is draining the battery down so i changed the batter and noticed there was water in the trunk of my car after it rained. But didn\u2019t think nothing of it. That same day i parked my car at work turned the car off and went inside the building. 45 mins later they said my car was on fire  from the trunk. The fire department came and put the fire out\u2026 the fire and smoke cleared and the thing that caught on fire was the fuse box which is in the trunk and everything around it. I took my car to the Chevy dealership clay Cooley Chevrolet in Dallas Texas and they couldn\u2019t figure out why it caught on fire and that everything was too burnt up to tell what happened alls they know is that the fuse box shorted out. I took my complaints to GM and they did an investigation. It took 2 months and i did not get a rental till 3 days before they completed my investigation and they didn\u2019t search for one i had to go look for one . Then they told me that they are not going to help with the vehicle because the  fire was located in the \u201cluggage compartment space\u201d. They said you can\u2019t exactly tell where the fire came from because the fire burned everything up. Today they are telling me to give the rental back after just getting it 3 days ago and I\u2019m without a car.",

        "summary": "Around 3/2/2021 I received a dash warning light for the electronic parking brake indicating some form of malfunction.  The electronic parking brake began to stay on once set and when I would accelerate a bit, it would release.  Thereafter the rear brakes and calipers completely locked up while sitting in my garage and would not move.  I had to have it towed out of my garage and to a Chevrolet dealership for repair.  The Chevrolet dealer repaired it after approximately one week or more and five or six days later the indicator light returned stating electronic parking brake malfunction so I took it back to the Chevrolet dealership and they repaired again.  I had also contacted the dealership I purchased from in Tennessee and made them aware of the problem and they agreed to pay for the repair because my warranty did not cover this repair because it happened to be from prior damage to the car before i purchased it.  After speaking in great detail with the Chevrolet dealer, it was explained to me that this is beyond repair at this point if I were to have any further issues with this and strongly recommended having this replaced and that it is currently unsafe considering this could happen again including while I am driving and could result in to an accident and possible injury to myself and others.  I then hired an attorney to dispute this with the dealership I purchased from and they on many occasions declined any compensation for this.  It is very pricy and the salesperson had told me at one point the car tire had had a blowout and defected a wiring issue with the electronic parking brake and that the switch had been replaced and that the side indicator lights were not working off and on.  He assured me that this had been fixed, meaning it only needed a switch.  The whole Body Wiring Harness was very badly effected and there are currently seventeen wires that are not secure in which control a lot of the car.  I did also retrieve the service records.",

THE DANGER IS THAT I WAS INFORMED THAT GM WELDS LOW PRESSURE CAST WHEELS TO FULFILL WARRANTY CLAIMS.

IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION THIS IS DANGEROUS. ESPECIALLY ON A HEAVY CAR THAT IS MADE TO RUN ON A TRACK AT 150 MPH PLUS. A CRACK IS CAUSED BY IMPURITIES IN THE ALLOY. IF THE ALLOY HAS IMPURITIES THEY USUALLY AREN'T ISOLATED TO ONE SPECIFIC SPOT. THIS CRACK ACTUALLY GREW FROM THE LIP INTO THE BARREL OF THE WHEEL IN A COUPLE DAYS TIME, ANOTHER WAY YOU CAN TELL IT WASN'T CAUSED BY IMPACT AND THAT THE IMPURITIES ARE MOST LIKELY IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE WHEEL.
