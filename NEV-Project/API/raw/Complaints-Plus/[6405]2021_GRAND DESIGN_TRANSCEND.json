        "summary": "BOUGHT THIS AT ROBERSON RV, IN SALEM, OREGON. PICKED UP ON 2/15. AT HOME, NOTICED OUTSIDE PROPANE LEAK, SHUT IT OFF. ALSO NOTICED THAT THERE WAS NO SMOKE DETECTOR IN TRAILER, ONLY 2 CO DETECTORS. CONTACT LOCAL FIRE MARSHAL OFFICE. THESE BOTH ARE NFPA 1193, MAJOR LIFE SAFETY VIOLATIONS, BOTH ON/OFF ROAD. CAME FROM GRAND DESIGN FACTORY THAT WAY. DEALER DID GIVE ME FACTORY WARRANTY CHECK OFF LIST, SIGNED BY THEM, THAT THERE WAS NO LEAKS AND SMOKE DETECTOR WAS IN PLACE/WORKING. THAT IS A LEGAL DOCUMENT, I BELIEVE. I DID CONTACT GRAND DESIGN ABOUT THIS, WITH NO REPLY, SO FAR. MY CONSERNIS THAT HOW MANY OTHER TRAILERS/ MOTOR HOMES, MADE BY THEM ARE THE SAME WAY??? I AM  DISABLED/RETIRED FIREFIGHTER/MEDIC, AND DON'T WANT THIS TO HAPPEN TO OTHER FAMILIES. I HAVE SEEN THE RESULTS OF THIS MANY TIMES, IN MY JOB . NOT PRETTY. WHY ARE THEY TRYING TO KEEP THIS QUIET. THIS AFFECTS A LOT OF PEOPLE, POTENTIALLY. PLEASE CONTACT ME AT [XXX], AS NEEDED. I DID LOSE MY PREVIOUS TT, IN THE LIONSHEAD WILD LAND FIREAT DETROIT, OREGON, LABOR DAY WEEKEND 2020. BEARLY MADE IT OUT ALIVE. JUST GOT DONE WITH THE INSURANCE AND FEMA PAPERWORK. THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHILE THIS IS A BIG DEAL FOR ME. THANK YOU AGAIN.*DT*JB  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",
