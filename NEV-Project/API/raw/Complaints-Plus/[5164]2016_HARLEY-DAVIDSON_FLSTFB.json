        "summary": "THIS BIKE HAS 9000 MILES ON IT AND JUST HAD A REAR TIRE INSTALLED BY HARLEY 2 MONTHS AGO.  7 HOURS FROM HOME I WAS TURNING A CORNER AT A LOW RATE OF SPEED WHEN THE REAR WHEEL BEARING DISINTEGRATED AND DAMAGED THE WHEEL, THE BRAKE ROTOR AND THE CALIPER.  THE FIRST MECHANIC THAT SAW IT SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN ONE THAT BAD.  $450 TO TOW TO HARLEY AND ANOTHER $536 TO GET IT TO MY HOME SHOP.  MY DEALER TOLD ME THEY CAN'T GET PARTS FOR OVER A MONTH BECAUSE THE WHEEL WAS RECALLED OFF THE SHELF BY CORPORATE, BUT HE WON'T TELL ME WHY IT WAS RECALLED OR IF IT MAY HAVE CAUSED THIS BREAKDOWN.  THE BEARING OR THE WHEEL WAS OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE.  IF THEY ARE RECALLING THIS WHEEL I HAVE A RIGHT TO RECOUP MY LOSSES SO FAR.  THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN ON A BRAND NEW BIKE AND I SHOULD HAVE SOME RECOURSE HERE.",
