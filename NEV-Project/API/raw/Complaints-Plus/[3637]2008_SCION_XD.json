AGAIN, (LIKE IN THE FIRST INCIDENT) THE CAR CONTINUED TO CRANK WITHOUT STARTING. I AGAIN HAD THE CAR TOWED TO TOYOTA FOR CAR SERVICE.  IT IS CURRENTLY IN THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  THE SERVICE TECH DID TELL ME TODAY THAT HE BELIEVES THE PROBLEM MAY BE WITH THE FUEL LEVEL SENSOR, BUT NOT SURE.  THIS NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED THOROUGHLY AS THIS CAR HAS STALLED (WITHOUT WARNING) ON ME TWICE WHILE ON THE ROAD, ONCE IN AN INTERSECTION AND ONCE ON THE FREEWAY, WHICH PUTS MYSELF, MY FAMILY,  AND OTHERS AT HIGH RISK FOR A COLLISION. *TR",

THEY TOLD US THAT IT WAS THE REAR HUB SPEED SENSOR ASSEMBLY: $605.00 TO REPLACE!!!  WE HAD KURT'S AUTOMOTIVE IN ROCKFORD TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT IT, THEY COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING THAT SHOWED JUSTIFICATION OF THAT BEING THE PROBLEM. SO IT HAS NOT BEEN FIXED AND IT HAS NOT COME ON AGAIN FOR OVER A MONTH, WHEN IT DID COME ON OUR BRAKES WERE SPONGY AT TIMES TOO, LIKE THE OTHER COMPLAINT STATED & NOT AS RESPONSIVE.   WE HAVE HAD THE RECALL (PCV TO BRAKE LINE CONDENSATION FIX) DONE BY ANDERSON AND THE ANTI-LOCK LIGHT WAS STILL COMING ON AFTER THAT TOO. BUT IT SEEMS WHEN IT STARTED GETTING WARMER OUT THE ANTI-LOCK LIGHT STOPPED AND BRAKES WERE FINE.   JUST LAST WEEK, MAY 7 2010 WE TOOK IT IN TO ANDERSON'S FOR THE SERVICE BULLETIN SB-0032-09 INTERMITTENT HARD STARTING OR EXTENDED STARTING WHICH JUST STARTED TWO WEEKS AGO. THIS FIX(???) IS COVERED UNDER TOYOTA FEDERAL EMISSIONS WARR. 80K MILE OR 96MO., WHICH THE FIRST TIME I SOMEONE TOLD ME IT WOULD COST US $55 TO DIAGNOSE IT!!??  SECOND TIME I CALLED I TALKED TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AT ANDERSON, HE SAID BRING IT IN, IT'S UNDER WARRANTY.   ANDERSON UPDATED THE ECM/PCM MODULES, CLEANED CARBON BUILDUP OUT OF COMBUSTION CHAMBERS, ADDED FUEL CLEANER. AND THE VERY NEXT DAY AS MY WIFE LEFT FROM A TRIP 120 MILES AWAY TO HEAD BACK HOME IT STARTED DOING IT AGAIN!!!!  HARD, EXTENDED STARTUP OF ENGINE!  NO SERVICE ENGINE LIGHTS WHEN THIS HAPPENS & THERE HAVE BEEN NO ERROR CODES IN COMPUTER. ALTHOUGH THE SERVICE CENTER TOLD ME THEY CAN RESET THEMSELVES WHEN THE VEHICLE IS TURNED OFF.   OF COURSE THIS CAR JUST WENT OUT OF WARRANTY 43,000 CURRENT MILES, ON A (3YRS/36K WARR.)!!! MY WIFE WORKS NEAR CHICAGO SO IT MAKES FOR AN EVEN TOUGHER COMMUTE WONDERING EVERYDAY IF IT WILL START, THEN WILL SHE GET STUCK AT WORK!  TOYOTA, SEEMS YOUR QUALITY HAS GONE SQUAT!! *TR",
