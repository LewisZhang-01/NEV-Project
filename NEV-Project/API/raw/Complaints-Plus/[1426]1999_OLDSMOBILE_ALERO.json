I CHECKED THE CAR OVER INSIDE AND OUT AND FOUND NOTHING AMISS, ONLY THE SMELL.  I RETREATED TO THE CONFINES OF MY HOME AND AFTER A PERIOD OF 10 MINUTES, I HEARD WHAT APPEARED TO BE A GUN SHOT NOISE THEN A HISSING SOUND.  I STEPPED OUTSIDE AND NOTICED THE HISSING SOUND WAS COMING FROM MY CARS RIGHT FRONT TIRE, WHICH HAD GONE FLAT. DECIDING I WOULD CHECK THE SITUATION THE NEXT MORNING THEN RETURNED TO THE HOUSE.  THE NEXT MORNING, I LOOKED TO FIND IN FACT THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE WAS FLAT.  MY FIANCE TRIED TO PLACE A SCISSOR JACK UNDER THE FRONT OF THE CAR TO JACK IT UP AND REPLACE THE TIRE, BUT WAS UNABLE TO DO SO.  WE PLACED THE JACK UNDER THE REAR TIRE AND JACKED THAT UP UNTIL THERE WAS SUFFICIENT ROOM TO PLACE ANOTHER JACK UNDER THE FRONT TIRE.  WHEN THE CAR WAS JACKED HIGH ENOUGH TO LOOK AT THE TIRE, WE NOTICED THE COIL SPRING HAD SCHEARED IN HALF CAUSING THE JAGGED EDGE OF THE SPRING TO GOUGH INTO THE FRONT TIRE CAUSING IT TO GO FLAT.  THERE IS AN INDICATION THAT THE MANUFACTURES WELD ON THE SPRING WAS POORLY DONE AS APPARENT BY A  RUST SPOT AT THE BREAKING POINT. I ALSO BELIEVE THE STRUT INSIDE THE COIL SPRING IS DAMAGED ALSO.  *AK",

AT A COST OF $652.01, ON 28-OCTOBER-2003 I HAD SERVICE PERFORMED ON MY VEHICLE BECAUSE I WAS LOOSING COOLANT AT REGULAR INTERVALS AND IT WAS NOT LEAKING ONTO THE GROUND.  THE SEVERE CAUSE FOR CONCERN WAS AFTER I HAD REFILLED MY COOLANT RESERVOIR, DROVE APPROXIMATELY 3 MILES, AND ALL OF THE COOLANT WAS GONE.  THE TEMPERATURE GUAGE SHOT UP TO THE RED ZONE, AND I PULLED OVER IMMEDIATELY.  I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALER AND THEY INDICATED THAT THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR VEHICLES WITH THIS ENGINE.  THEY REPLACED THE INTAKE GASKET AND I WAS ON MY WAY.  A FEW WEEKS LATER I NOTICED THE COOLANT LEVEL WAS LOW AGAIN, AND I HAD TO ADD MORE COOLANT.  I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP ON 25-NOVEMBER-2003.  THEY CHECKED THE CAR AND SAID THEY COULD FIND NO LEAKS.  I CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE CAR.  CONSISTENTLY, EVERY 2 WEEKS, I WAS REFILLING THE COOLANT RESEVOIR.  THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING UNTIL RECENTLY (FEBRUARY 2004).  IN LATE FEBRUARY 2004 I STARTED LOSING COOLANT AT A MUCH FASTER RATE, ABOUT 3 DAY INTERVALS.  ON 2-MARCH-2004 MY CAR DID NOT START THE FIRST 2 TIMES I TRIED, ON THE THIRD IT CAUGHT.  I DECIDED TO INSPECT THE OIL, USING THE DIP STICK, AND FOUND THAT THE OIL WAS A THICK GOO.  THIS PROMPTED ME TO CALL GM AND THE DEALERSHIP TO IDENTIFY MY OPTIONS FOR HAVING THIS PROBLEM RESOLVED.  I AM FRUSTRATED, AGGREVATED, ANNOYED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AND I FEAR THAT HAD THIS GONE UNDETECTED, THE OIL WOULD HAVE GOTTEN TO A STATE WHERE IT WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED THE ENGINE TO FUNCTION, PERHAPS LEADING TO AN ACCIDENT.  NOT ONLY DO I FEAR FOR MY SAFETY, BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT HAVING A SEVERE PROBLEM LIKE THIS \"FIXED\" ONLY TO FIND THAT IT HAPPENS AGAIN WILL ONLY LEAD TO THE SAMETHING HAPPENING YET ANOTHER TIME.

AFTER THAT, IT WORKED FOR LESS THAN 2 DAYS AND STARTED BLOWING HOT AIR AGAIN. I RETURNED TO THE REPAIR SHOP, THIS TIME THEY PUT IT ON ALL THE GAUGES AND SAW IT WOULDN'T HOLD A CHARGE. THEY TOOK THE CAR FOR A QUICK RIDE, AND RAN THE AC FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES. WHEN WE STOPPED, THERE WAS A REALLY BAD SMELL. THEY SPRAYED EVERYTHING WITH A BLUE SPRAY AND SAW BUBBLES ON THE HOSE LINE. THEY LOOKED CLOSER AND NOTICED THE SIDE AND UNDERSIDE OF THE HOSE WAS BURNED THROUGH BOTH THE COVERING AND THE HOSE ITSELF, AND MAINTAIN IT WAS CAUSED BY THE HOSE BEING A LITTLE TOO LONG AND BEING ABLE TO REST UP AGAINST THE ENGINE. AM I REALLY THE ONLY OWNER OF A 1999 ALERO THAT HAS EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM?  I CAN'T BELIEVE I SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THIS HOSE (WHICH IS A PRETTY EXTENSIVE JOB). THIS IS THE SECOND SUMMER I'VE BEEN WITHOUT AC, AND THEY HAVE BEEN PRETTY HOT AND UNPLEASANT SUMMERS, (ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE AS BAD AS THE MIDDLE EAST). I'VE ALREADY INVESTED $79.95 TO HAVE THE AC CHECKED OUT, CHARGED, FREON ADDED. RIGHT NOW I'M I VERY DISSATISFIED OLDSMOBILE OWNER. I'VE CHECKED THE DEFECT INVESTIGATIONS AND RECALLS, AND FOUND NO OTHER MENTION OF THIS DESIGN DEFECT, BUT I STILL MAINTAIN THAT THIS COULDN'T BE A ONE OF A KIND. WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST I DO FROM HERE? I DON'T FEEL I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE THE HOSE REPLACED, SINCE I DID NOTHING TO CAUSE THE HOSE TO BURN/MELT. ONE TIE WRAP WOULD HAVE BEEN A SIMPLE, INEXPENSIVE SOLUTION, BUT NOW IT'S WAY BEYOND THAT POINT.  PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS. THE SUMMER ISN'T COOLING OFF, AND I CAN'T BUY ANY CHOCOLATE CANDY BARS TO CALM ME DOWN BECAUSE THEY ALL MELT FASTER THAN I CAN EAT THEM.

THEY ADMIT THAT THERE IS A DEFECT WHICH THEY THOUGHT WAS THE FUEL PRESSURE REGULATOR BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD THIS PROBLEM IN OTHER ALERO'S, BUT APPARANTLY THAT WASN'T IT.  I FORGOT TO ADD THAT AFTER THE CAR SITS FOR AWHILE, IT STARTS BACK UP, SO THE IT WON'T DUPLICATE ITSELF AT THE DEALERSHIP.  YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THIS WILL HAPPEN, BUT I HAVE NOTICED THAT IT HAS OCCURRED WITHIN 24 HOURS AFTER FILLING THE TANK UP WITH FUEL AND I TOLD THEM THIS BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT NOT STARTING UP OR SOMETHING IN THE FUEL LINE WAS DEFECTIVE.  I PERSONALLY THINK THAT THE CAR NEEDS TO BE RECALLED.  I'VE ONLY HAD THE CAR FOR 5 MONTHS AND ITS BEEN IN THE SHOP TWICE.  THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED IT WAS ON A WEEKEND AND THE DEALERSHIP WAS CLOSED.  SO FAR MY CAR HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP CUMULATIVE 15 DAYS.  I THINK THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IT HAS LEFT ME AND MY SON STRANDED AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ANYONE ELSE, BUT I FEEL THAT THE CONSUMERS NEED TO KNOW THIS. THIS IS MY ONLY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION AND I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THAT CAR ANY LONGER AND AM NOT TAKING IT BACK.  WE HAVE YET TO WORK OUT A RESOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM. PLEASE CONTACT THE DEALERSHIP AND THE MANUFACTURER (GENERAL MOTORS) TO INVESTIGATE THIS PROBLEM.  THIS COULD RESULT IN A MUCH MORE SERIOUS PROBLEM IF THE DEFECTS AREN'T DETECTED.  I SPOKE WITH BRENT WALLS, GM FACTORY REPRESENTATIVE @ 1-800-823-0055 X8174.
