The technician said the warning airbag light is something else but he could not say what. Please add additional recalls to fix passenger airbag. But he said \u201cthe light was on before the recall\u201d and I would have to pay to find out what the warning is for. I waited 2 hours for the recall work to be finished and when I entered my car the warning light was still on. This vehicle has not been in an accident. This situation I read in the reviews online is happening to this car and many complaints. I feel unsafe and I think all possible recalls should be put in place for this to be taken care of by Toyota. It is dangerous and it is a liability. Please help me get this resolved with AutoNation Toyota in Winter Park.

HALL TOYOTA OF ELIZABETH CITY IS THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP TO ME, AND IS ALMOST 2 HOURS DRIVE AWAY (ABOUT 90 MILES).  THE RECALL NOTICE FROM TOYOTA STATES, \"IF YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE DRIVING THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP, PLEASE CONTACT YOUR LOCAL AUTHORIZED TOYOTA DEALER WHO WILL ARRANGE FOR VEHICLE PICK UP.\"  THE DEALERSHIP ASSIGNED ME AN ADVISOR, RUSS, WHO SAID I NEEDED TO CALL TOYOTA TO HAVE THEM OPEN A CASE AND GIVE ME A CASE NUMBER.  RUSS SAID TOYOTA WOULD THEN CALL THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY WOULD WORK OUT ARRANGEMENTS TO PICK UP MY VEHICLE.  I CALLED TOYOTA AND SPOKE WITH SOMEONE NAMED RAFAEL, WHO GAVE ME A CASE NUMBER (2002102338), BUT SAID THE DEALERSHIP WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TOWING CHARGE.  HE SAID TOYOTA WAS NOT GOING TO CALL THE DEALERSHIP, AND THAT I NEEDED TO CALL THE DEALERSHIP TO ARRANGE TOWING.  I CALLED RUSS AT THE DEALERSHIP, WHO SAID HIS SUPERVISOR WAS TALKING TO TOYOTA AND HE WOULD CALL ME LATER.  THE NEXT DAY, AFTER NOT HEARING BACK, I CALLED RUSS, WHO SAID HIS SUPERVISOR HAD NOT YET HEARD BACK FROM TOYOTA, AND THE SUPERVISOR WOULD CALL ME WHEN HE HAD INFORMATION FROM TOYOTA.  LATER THAT DAY RUSS CALLED ME TO SAY TOYOTA AGREED TO COVER $120 OF THE TOWING CHARGE, WHICH RUSS SAID WOULD RUN AROUND $500 TO $550.  THE DEALERSHIP WOULD NOT PAY THE DIFFERENCE, SO I WOULD NEED TO PAY THE REST MYSELF.  THIS SEEMS CONTRARY TO WHAT IS STATED IN TOYOTA'S LETTER.  RAFAEL AT TOYOTA STATED THEY ABSOLUTELY WERE NOT RECOMMENDING I DRIVE 2 HOURS TO THE DEALERSHIP.  I SEEM TO BE LEFT WITH NO GOOD OPTION.

AM I WAITING FOR THIS TO GO OFF BEFORE SOMETHING IS DONE? HOPE THE METAL FRAGMENTS DON'T FLY IN THE BACK SEAT WHERE MY DOG IS! OR FLY SIDE WAYS AND HIT ME WHEN I'M DRIVING! IT'S ALREADY INCONVENIENCE I CAN'T HAVE A PASSENGER IN THE FRONT.",

AND TOYOTA'S RECOMMENDATION IS THAT I DO NOT OPERATE THE VEHICLE WITH AN OCCUPANT IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT. WHAT ABOUT THE PREVIOUS 11 YEARS THAT RODE IN THAT SEAT WITH THE SAME DEFECT? IF TOYOTA TRULY CARED ABOUT MY SAFETY, THEY SHOULD HAVE MADE THAT SUGGESTION WHEN THEY FIRST KNEW OF IT. BUT THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE SOLD VERY MANY 4 PASSENGER COROLLAS SET-UP WITH 3 PEOPLE IN THE BACK SEAT AND ONLY THE DRIVER SITTING IN FRONT. HECK, TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS THEY SHOULD HAVE REMOVED THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT OR REMOVED THE BACK OF THAT SEAT ALONG WITH THE SEAT-BELT TO GUARANTEE NOBODY RIDES IN THAT SEAT. BUT NONE OF THOSE THINGS HAPPENED SIMPLY BECAUSE TRUTH BE TOLD, IT ONLY BECAME A SAFETY ISSUE ONCE TOYOTA HAD TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE DEFECT; THEIR BEHAVIOR IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. A SINCERE APOLOGY WOULD STATE \"FOR ANY INCONVENIENCES THIS HAS CAUSED.\" INSTEAD OF \"WE SINCERELY APOLOGIZE FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE THIS WILL CAUSE, BUT WE ARE TAKING THIS ACTION TO ENSURE YOUR SAFETY.\" CAUGHT IN THEIR OWN LIE IS WHAT REALLY OCCURRED AGAIN IF THEY TRULY CARED WE WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM ASAP.....THE PEOPLE I FEEL THE MOST PAIN FOR ARE THOSE UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE WHO GOT INTO A FRONT CAR ACCIDENT AND DID EVERYTHING RIGHT, BUT THEIR AIRBAG, THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO SAVE THEIR LIFE, WOUND UP EITHER INJURING THEM OR NOT DOING ITS INTENDED JOB ALL WHILE TOYOTA KNEW OF THE PROBLEM.

IT WAS IN WINTER 2008 THAT THE ENGINE WARNING LAMP ILLUMINATED. I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP. I WASN'T REALLY GIVEN A REAL EXPLANATION OF WHY THE WARNING LAMP WAS ILLUMINATED. I WAS QUICKLY TOLD IT COULD BE FIXED. SO I PAID APPROX. $800.00 TO SUPPOSEDLY HAVE IT FIXED. LITERALLY, TWO WEEKS LATER THE ENGINE WARNING LAMP CAME BACK ON. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE SAME TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG AND WOULD HAVE TO RUN MORE DIAGNOSTIC TEST THAT WOULD COST ADDITIONAL MONEY. AT THE TIME, I DID NOT HAVE ADDITIONAL MONEY SINCE I HAD JUST DISHED OUT NEARLY $800.00. I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO INDEPENDENT AUTO SHOPS IN WHICH THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS, YEARLY INSPECTIONS OF AN OPERATING VEHICLE IS REQUIRED. FOR THE PAST YEARS, I HAVE HAD TO HAVE THE LIGHT MANUALLY TURNED OFF HOPING THAT IT WOULD NOT COME ON IN TIME FOR THE CAR TO BE INSPECTED. THE CAR HAS FAILED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BECAUSE THE ENGINE WARNING LAMP ILLUMINATED.  IN ADDITION TO THE ENGINE WARNING LAMP BEING ILLUMINATED, I HAVE ALSO AND STILL EXPERIENCE HARSH SHIFTING. THE HARSH SHIFTING STARTED APPROX.  IN LATE 2009/2010.   I ALSO STARTED NOTICING DECREASED LIGHTING VISIBILITY IN 2011. AT NIGHT, I HAVE TO DRIVE WITH MY HIGH BEAMS TO SEE PROPERLY. OUT OF FRUSTRATION, I GAVE UP ON TRYING TO FIND THE CAUSE FOR THESE ISSUES. I JUST DEALT WITH IT.  I DON'T FREQUENTLY USE THE VEHICLE NOW BECAUSE I LIVE IN AN AREA THAT IS ACCESSIBLE TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION THAT ALLOWS ME TO GET TO WORK.  MOST RECENTLY, I WAS INFORMED BY A FELLOW COROLLA OWNER THAT IN 2009-2010 TOYOTA RECALLED FOR ENGINE AND ENGINE COOLING AND HEADLAMPS. I NEVER RECEIVED NOTIFICATIONS OF SUCH RECALLS!",

THIS EXPLOSION HAS BEEN LINKED TO MANY CASES OF SERIOUS INJURY AND/OR DEATH.     THE NOTICE INFORMED ME I WOULD RECEIVE ANOTHER NOTIFICATION WHEN PARTS WERE AVAILABLE IN MY AREA TO HAVE THE REPLACEMENT CONDUCTED.

I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A SAFETY PRECAUTION, HOWEVER, AFTER 8 MONTHS AND COUNTING IT HAS BECOME QUITE AN INCONVENIENCE. FURTHERMORE, I LIVE IN PORTLAND, OR AND IT IS VERY HUMID/MOIST IN THIS REGION OF THE COUNTRY. THIS CAUSES EVEN MORE CONCERN TO ME THAT THIS ISSUE IS NOT BEING RESOLVED IN A TIME SENSITIVE MANNER.

THE INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHO REPAIRED MY CAR THOUGHT THAT THE TENSIONER ON THE TIMING CHAIN MAY HAVE HAD A PROBLEM THAT CAUSED THE CAM GEAR TO WEAR OUT, SO THAT THE TIMING CHAIN SLIPPED OFF THE CAM GEAR. THEN, THE PROBLEM CAUSED THE ENGINE VALVES TO BE BENT. FINALLY MY CAR GOT FIXED. THE PROBLEM OCCURRED IN A SHOPPING MALL PARKING LOT WHEN I STARTED THE ENGINE, I FELT BOOM, BOOM, KNOCKING COMING FROM THE FRONT OF THE CAR. I DROVE OUT OF THE PARKING LOT CAREFULLY, BUT I WAS CONCERNED BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I EVER HAD THIS KNOCKING FROM THE CAR. SO I STOPPED IN A DIFFERENT PARKING LOT OF THE SAME MALL. I LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD AND CHECKED THE DRIVE BELT, WHICH WAS INTACT. THERE WAS NO FOUL SMELL. I RESTARTED THE CAR AND PAID ATTENTION TO ANYTHING UNUSUAL. I HEARD RATTLING AND I DECIDED TO TAKE MY CAR TO AN AUTO MECHANIC SHOP, WHICH IS CLOSER THAN GOING HOME. WITH MY EMERGENCY LIGHT ON, I DROVE INTO THE STREET LESS  MILE WHEN I HEARD SOUNDS LIKE METAL OR SODA CANS CRUSHING AROUND IN THE ENGINE. THEN MY CAR SLOWLY STOPPED AND THE ENGINE STOPPED. I PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND SLID DOWN TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, BARELY OFF THE ROAD. EVENTUALLY MY CAR WAS TOWED TO THE AUTO SHOP.

ROUGHLY ABOUT THREE OR FOUR MORE DAYS GO BY AND THE ANNOYING CLICKING STARTED AGAIN AND THEN ONE OF THE ICON ON THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS UP.  I OPENED THE GLOVE BOX TO GET OUT THE MANUAL.  THE MANUAL HAD SHOWN THAT IT WAS THE AIRBAG LIGHT.  I FIGURED SINCE I WAS DUE FOR A OIL CHANGE AT THE DEALERSHIP THAT WOULD ASK THEM ABOUT THAT LIGHT. ON AUGUST 2, 2013 I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP TO GET THE OIL CHANGE.  THEY TOLD ME THAT THE LIGHTED ICON WAS ABOUT THE AIRBAG AND SAID THAT IT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  I ASKED \"HOW COME I NEED TO REPLACE A AIRBAG THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN USED YET?\"  THEY SAID THAT SPIRAL CABLE HAD A FAILURE AND THAT IT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED BEFORE I GOT A INSPECTION STICKER OR ELSE MY CAR WILL FAIL THE INSPECTION. I ASKED THE MAN IF IT WAS PART OF A RECALL BECAUSE IT DIDN'T SOUND RIGHT TO ME THAT A AIRBAG WILL NEED REPLACING EVEN IF IT HASN'T BEEN USED.  THEY SAID NO.  SO I MADE A APPOINTMENT FOR AUGUST 24, 2013.   I PAID $380.00 FOR THE REPAIR OF A SPIRAL CABLE.  I WASN'T HAPPY AT ALL.  SO NOW JULY 20, 2015 I GET A RECALL NOTICE ABOUT REPLACING THE AIRBAG AND WHICH I PAID $380.00 FOR BACK IN 2013.  MY FIRST QUESTION HOW DO OR WHO DO I GET MY REFUND FOR REPLACING A DEFECTED AIRBAG?  CAN YOU PLEASE DIRECT ME TO THE PROPER PLACE TO MAKE A CLAIM BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT'S UNFAIR FOR ME TO LOOSE OUT ON $380. I AM VERY UPSET BECAUSE I WORK VERY HARD TO SAVE MONEY.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  *TR",

ON MONDAY, NOVEMBER 17TH, 2014 MY SON WAS DRIVING OUR CAR SOUTHBOUND IN LANE 2 OF GEORGIA AVENUE WHEN ANOTHER DRIVER PULLED OUT OF A SECONDARY ROAD OF THE HOME DEPOT PARKING LOT AND WENT DIRECTLY INTO LANE 2 IN FRONT OF OUR CAR. MY SON WAS UNABLE TO AVOID THE OTHER DRIVER AND STRUCK HIS CAR IN THE REAR CAUSING LITTLE DAMAGE FOR THE DRIVERS CAR. THE IMPACT CAUSED A LOT OF DAMAGE IN THE FRONT END OF OUR CAR. MY SON DID NOT SUFFER A FRACTURE OR A SEVERE INJURY BUT HE GOT A CERVICAL SPRAIN, IN ADDITION TO DEVELOPING BACK PAIN, LEFT KNEE PAIN. THE IMPACT WAS SO BAD THAT OUR CAR WAS DEEMED A TOTAL LOSS.  BUT INTERESTINGLY, THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY AT ALL!  IF THE AIRBAGS WERE DEFECTIVE AS IT HAS BEEN FOR OTHER TOYOTA CARS THEN I MAY HAVE HAD A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FIXED OR REPLACED SO THEY WOULD HAVE WORKED PROPERLY IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT THAT'S WHY WE TRUST IN THE MANUFACTURER AND  IN THE WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS IN THE MANUAL. ..UPDATED 12/29/14 *BF  *TR",

THE AIRBAGS HAD DEPLOYED AND WAS A RIPPED UP MESS FROM MY STEERING WHEEL. I HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME AND WAS SO DAZED AND SHOCKED AND MY WRIST HAD SHATTERED REQUIRING REPARATIVE SURGERY AND REHABILITATION HOWEVER IT'S STILL NOT OK. DUE TO MY CONFUSION I DENIED MEDICAL TREATMENT UNTIL A FEW DAYS LATER. THIS CONFUSION STILL AFFECTS ME BADLY NOW AS I SUFFER FROM SEVERE PTSD. THE POLICE TOOK PICTURES AND A REPORT. THE PEOPLE IN THE CAR I HIT WERE TAKEN BY AMBULANCE. & RECOMMENDED I BE TAKEN AS WELL BUT I REFUSED. THE CAR HAD BEEN TOTALED WITH SEVERE BODY DAMAGE TO THE FRONT AND A BENT FRAME THAT IT WAS ABLE TO DRIVE FROM THE SCENE.

IT HAD APPROX. 18000 MILES WHEN I GOT T IN FEB OF 2007. IT WAS VERY BASIC AND A STANDARD. THE SHIFTING/CLUTCH NEVER SEEMED RIGHT FROM THE START BUT I LEARNED HOW TO DEAL WITH IT. IN FEB OF 2010, I WAS LEAVING WORK AND WAS A FEW MILES FROM HOME. I HAD NEVER IN MY MANY YEARS OF DRIVING HAD A WRECK. THE TRUCK AHEAD OF ME CAME TO AN ABRUPT STOP AND AS I TRIED TO BRAKE,MY CAR SEEMED TO SPEED UP AND WENT RIGHT UP UNDER THE TRUCK. THE WHOLE FRONT END SMASHED RIGHT UP TO THE WINDSHIELD YET THE AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY. INSURANCE DEEMED IT A TOTAL LOSS BUT IT WAS RIGHT AT THE POINT WHERE I STILL OWED AS MUCH AS THE PAY OFF SO THEY WENT AHEAD AND FIXED IT. I WAS OUT A LOT OF MONEY. THE SECOND WRECK JUST OCCURRED ON MARCH 15,2013. I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM A FAMILY MEMBERS RESIDENCE IN THE COUNTRY AND WAS TRAVELING ON DESERTED ROADS AT ABOUT 3:30 AM. I WENT AROUND AN S CURVE THAT I GREW UP DRIVING SO IT I WAS VERY FAMILIAR. I TRIED TO SLOW DOWN,BUT AGAIN SEEMED TO ACCELERATE. I OVER CORRECTED AND RAN THRU A DITCH AND COMPLETELY THREW A METAL FENCE. AGAIN. THE AIRBAG,WHICH ALWAYS HAD THE LIGHT ON AS IF READY TO DEPLOY,DID NOT GO OFF. I WAS HURT VERY BADLY AND APPARENTLY BLACKED OUT FOR A GOOD WHILE. THIS TIME THE INSURANCE DEEMED IT A TOTAL LOSS AND WE ARE WAITING ON A SETTLEMENT FROM OUR INSURANCE PLUS I HURT MY KNEE AND AM MEETING WITH A SURGEON NEXT WEEK. THAT CAR WAS NOTHING BUT TROUBLE AND I AM HAPPY TO B RID OF IT BUT FEEL WE ALL DESERVE JUSTICE FOR ALL THE MANY ERRORS TOYOTA HAS GIVEN THIS VEHICLE.  *TR",

I TRIED ABOUT 3-4 TIMES TO START, BUT IT DID NOT CRANK AT ALL. SO I CALLED THE TOW TRUCK AND TOWED TO NEARBY FIRESTONE IN ORANGE, CA. THEY FIRST SUSPECTED MAY BE THE BAD BATTERY, AND CHECKED AND REPLACE THE BATTERY BUT STILL DIDN'T START. SO THEY DID COMPLETE DIAGNOSIS AND FOUND THAT FUEL WASN'T REACHING TO THE ENGINE DUE TO FUEL PUMP FAILURE. THEY RECOMMENDED TO CHANGED THE WHOLE FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY AND CHARGED ME ABOUT $1100. THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE HAS BEEN KNOWN ISSUES ON 05 TOYOTA COROLLA FOR FUEL PUMP FAILURE AND THEY KNEW IN 2005 AND ISSUED NOTICE TOO. I HAVE BOUGHT THIS BRAND NEW IN '04 AUGUST FROM TOYOTA IN CLAREMONT, CA. AT LEAST THEY SHOULD HAVE NOTIFIED US VIA EMAIL OR POSTAL MAIL SINCE THEY KNEW ABOUT IT, THAN I COULD HAVE GONE TO DEALERSHIP AND HAVE THEM CHECKED FOR IT. NOW, I AM STUCK WITH THE $1100 BILL. THAT IS RIDICULOUS HOW CARELESS TOYOTA IS. NO WONDER, THEY HAD SO MANY RECALLS LAST YEAR 2011. I JUST WANT THE TOYOTA TO KNOW ABOUT IT AND SEND ME THE MONEY I PAID TO FIRESTONE. I HAVE GOOGLED ONLINE, AND FOUND SO MANY BLOGGER WHO HAD ISSUE WITH THE FUEL PUMP. SO IT HAS BEEN STILL GOING ON AND TOYOTA IS NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

I DID NOT HAVE THE WORK DONE BUT I DID HAVE THE GAS CAP CHECKED AT A CERTIFIED SMOG STATION AND CAP WAS FOUND TO BE OK.  I WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWERS I WAS RECEIVING SO I CALLED TOYOTA CORP. CUSTOMER SERVICE AND EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM.  I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WOULD CONTACT THE DEALER AND HAVE THEM CALL ME TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.

I ALSO ASKED IF THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM AND AGAIN WAS TOLD NO. THE TECH.TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED TO LEAVE THE CAR AND HE NEEDED TO ORDER THE PART.  I LEFT THE CAR AND WENT HOME AND I GOGGLED THIS PROBLEM AND FOUND THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS COMMON ENOUGH THAT TOYOTA ISSUED A TSB #02206, I ALSO FOUND MANY OTHER OWNERS THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM NOT ONLY WITH THE COROLLA BUT THE TOYOTA CAMRY AND TUNDRA. I CALLED BACK AND CANCELLED THE WORK AND PICKED UP THE CAR THE NEXT MORNING. I ADVISED THE TECH WHAT I FOUND ON GOOGLE BUT HE WAS NOT WILLING TO LISTEN.

BEFORE BRINGING MY CAR IN FOR SERVICE TO WESTCHESTER TOYOTA  ON 11/11/10, THE 'CHECK ENGINE LIGHT' HAD NEVER COME ON AND MY CAR WAS NOT GENERATING THE CURRENT VIBRATING NOISE.  I AM NOT QUALIFIED TO DETERMINE WHETHER WT COULD HAVE INTENTIONALLY OR INADVERTENTLY CAUSED THE DAMAGE TO MY CAR, BUT I CONSIDER  THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE DAMAGE TO MY CAR'S TRANSMISSION COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THEM.  BASED ON WHAT THE SERVICE MANAGER , MR. WILLIAM VESEY, INDICATED DURING MY MEETINGS WITH HIM, THE TRANSMISSION MAY HAD BEEN DAMAGED /MALFUNCTIONING ALL ALONG WHILE THE CAR WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY BUT THE DAMAGE/MALFUNCTION WAS NEVER DETECTED BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL ECM ON THE CAR MAY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DETECT THE DAMAGE SINCE THE ECM WAS FAULTY ITSELF. FOR THIS REASON, WHEN THE ECM WAS REPLACED ON 11/11/10 DUE TO THE RECALL, THE NEW ECM WAS ABLE TO DETECT THE PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION AND GENERATED THE TRANSMISSION ERROR CODE.  SINCE THE ECM WAS RECALLED AFTER MY WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED AND ITS MALFUNCTIONING MOST LIKELY PREVENTED THE  DETECTION OF THE TRANSMISSION ERROR, I BELIEF TOYOTA SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION. IN ADDITION , THE TRANSMISSION ALSO APPEARS TO BE A FAULTY PART WHICH MAY BE RECALLED IN THE FUTURE BASED ON THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN PROVIDED TO ME BY MR. VESEY.  WESTCHESTER TOYOTA SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION, FREE OF CHARGE INCLUDING ANY LABOR AND PARTS CHARGES.

DEALER CHANGED THE COMPUTER FOR ME.  THE ENGINE-STALL PROBLEM IS SOLVED.  RIGHT NOW, THE CAR (MOST PROBABLY THE ENGINE) STILL VIBRATES/SHAKES STRONGLY WHEN I STOP THE CAR AT THE STOP SIGN, AT THE RED LIGHT, AND DRIVE THE CAR AT VERY LOW SPEED (SUCH AS 1 TO 5 MILE PER HOUR). *TR",

THERE WAS NOTHING VISIBLE UPON INSPECTION AND NO CURRENT NOISES AT THAT TIME SO I PROCEEDED TO GO AGAIN FIRST SHIFTING INTO 1ST GEAR THEN SECOND AND I STOPPED AT 3RD AND WENT STRAIGHT HOME.

THEY THEN EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THIS WAS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS MOTOR(BEING THE TYPE THAT IT WAS) AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED IS A ROD IN THE ENGINE HAD BEEN SPUN. THEY SAID IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE AND I COULD HAVE LOST CONTROL AND WRECKED THE CAR VERY EASILY. THEY SAID THAT DUE TO THE NATURE AND PRICE THEY WOULD NOT FIX THE CAR BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A FULL NEW ENGINE REPLACEMENT AND THAT WOULD BE UP TO $8K BECAUSE OF IT BEING A RARE AND HIGH PERFORMANCE PRICE. AFTER FURTHER INSPECTION AND ONLINE RESEARCH IT IS VERY COMMON WHILE DOWNSHIFTING THIS ENGINE THAT THEY SLIP A GEAR AND SPIN THE ROD MOSTLY IN THE #4 ROD AND NEED A NEW ENGINE FOR COMPLETE REPAIRS. ALSO IT WOULD VERY LIKELY CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AGAIN AND AGAIN THUS PUTTING ME AND MY FAMILY IN DANGER ON THE ROAD. TOYOTA WILL NOT FIX THE PROBLEM THEY DO ACKNOWLEDGE IT AND THAT IT EXISTS, BUT WILL NOT DO THE REPAIRS BECAUSE OF THE PRICE ISSUE. IT IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE THOUGH.

THEY BEGAN ABOUT JULY 2009 AND CONTINUE TO THIS DAY, IN JULY, THE CAR WAS HARD TO START ON HOT DAYS.  IT MAY BE CORROSION AT THE BATTERY GROUND OR IT MAY BE SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS. THEN, ABOUT THE 1ST OF JANUARY, THE ELECTRIC LOCKS FAILED TO WORK.  ABOUT THE 20TH OF JANUARY, THEY WORKED AGAIN.  THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE ECM IS SUBJECT TO WATER EXPOSURE, AND CORROSION....WHICH WILL LEAD TO OTHER, PERHAPS DANGEROUS, FAILS. FOR AT LEAST 6 MONTHS, THE PASSENGER SAFETY BAG LIGHT HAS BEEN ON. THIS TOO, SUGGESTS SOME TYPE OF WEATHER EXPOSURE TO  A FLAWED DESIGN. IT IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT COULD MEAN THE SAFETY BAG MIGHT TRIGGER SPONTANEOUSLY WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION...THUS TRIGGERING AN ACCIDENT THAT COULD KILL ME, ANY PASSENGERS, AND IT COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT INVOLVING OTHER VEHICLES...RISKING THE LIVES OF MANY OTHERS.  MY FINAL ELECTRICAL PROBLEM BEGAN ON/ABOUT 1 MARCH OF THIS YEAR.  MY \"ENGINE FAULT\" LIGHT WENT ON AND REMAINS ON.  I DID CHECK ALL FLUIDS ON THE TOP OF THE ENGINE AND FOUND THEM TO BE OKAY.

THIS PROBLEM WAS A KNOWN ISSUE TO TOYOTA AND IT WAS SUCH AN ISSUE, THERE WAS A TSB (TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN) WRITTEN TO HELP MECHANICS DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.  I STOPPED BY THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE (NEW) AND THEY TOLD ME TO CALL TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE - WHICH I DID.  ALTHOUGH THEY ADMITTED TO AND RECOGNIZED THE PROBLEM, THEY SAID THEY WOULD ONLY PARTIALLY REIMBURSE PEOPLE WHO HAD LESS  THAN 80,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLES.  I HAD OVER THAT AMOUNT.  MY MECHANIC SAID IF I WERE TO TAKE IT TO A TOYOTA GARAGE, THEY WOULD JUST HAVE FIXED THE PROBLEM WITHOUT TELLING ME ABOUT IT, RATHER THAN HAVE A RECALL. THAT IS THE WAY THEY CIRCUMVENT THE SYSTEM AND HAVE HIGH QUALITY NUMBERS. THEY FIX THINGS WHILE THEY ARE IN THE SHOP FOR OTHER ROUTINE MAINTENANCE.  SINCE I DO ALL OF MY OWN MAINTENANCE - EXCEPT FOR MAJOR ITEMS - THEY  DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIX MY CAR.  I WOULD LIKE THIS TO BE ADDED TO THE EXPANDING FILE ON TOYOTA.  PERSONALLY, I THINK I SHOULD HAVE BEEN REIMBURSED FOR THE ALMOST $2000 IT COST TO REPLACE ONE OF THE FOUR SHIFT SOLENOID VALVES IN THE  TRANSMISSION AND THEN HAVE THE FAULTY COMPUTER REPLACED.  ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THIS WAS A KNOWN AND DOCUMENTED PROBLEM WITH BOTH COROLLA'S AND  MATRIX'S.  THEY HAVE DONE THIS A LOT IN THE PAST AND SHOULD BE NAILED  FOR THIS AND OTHER EPISODES.  I CAN TELL YOU AS I TOLD THE LADY IN CUSTOMER SERVICE - THIS WAS THE  FIRST AND LAST TOYOTA VEHICLE I WILL EVER PURCHASE.  I PURCHASED THIS  PARTICULAR VEHICLE BECAUSE I DROVE FROM PEORIA TO INDIANAPOLIS WEEKLY FOR WORK AS A CONSULTANT AND IT HAD DECENT GAS MILEAGE.  I WILL PURCHASE A GM OR FORD PRODUCT GOING FORWARD.

AS WE BOUGHT 5 YEARS PRE-PAID MAINTENANCE, WE HAVE REGULAR MAINTENANCE SERVICE WITH FAULKNER DEALER EVERY HALF YEAR UNTIL JULY 09, 2009. THERE HAS NO BIG PROBLEMS DURING THE FIRST 3-YEAR WARRANTY PERIOD EXCEPT ON AROUND SUMMER OF 2007, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON AND TOYOTA DEALER REPLACED THE COMPUTER CONTROL SYSTEM WITHOUT CHARGE (WE'RE NOT SURE THE REPLACED COMPUTER NAME AND WE THINK THE DEALER SHOULD HAVE RECORD).  THE WEATHER CONDITION IS LIGHT-MEDIUM RAIN WHILE OUR CAR ACCIDENT HAPPENED. WHEN THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED, MY 5-YEAR OLD SON AND I WERE IN THE CAR. THE ROAD SPEED LIMIT IS 25 MILES PER HOUR, I DROVE UNDER THE SPEED LIMIT AT A LOCAL ROAD AND IT IS ABOUT 2-3 MILES DISTANCE TO OUR DESTINATION. I REMEMBERED THAT I REDUCED THE SPEED AROUND A CURVE TO TURN ON ANOTHER ROAD. SUDDENLY I HEARD A LOUD ROARING ENGINE SOUND CAME FROM INSIDE, EVEN I PRESSED AND PRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL FOR SEVERAL TIMES, BUT I FEEL THAT I STEP ON THE AIR, IT DIDN'T HELP. THE CAR AUTOMATICALLY ACCELERATED WITH THE SPEED I CAN'T CONTROL AND I LOST THE CONTROL OF THE STEERING WHEEL, MY CAR WAS IN MALFUNCTION STATUS AND CRASHED TO THE RIGHT CURB AND THEN HIT THE BUSH WITH A HIGH SPEED AND TRAPPED IN WET MUD (THANK FOR GOD). THE ENGINE WAS STILL ROARING WITH A SCARED LOUD SOUND FOR MINUTES TILL I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION AND TOOK OFF THE KEY. OUR CAR WAS DAMAGED SERIOUSLY BY THIS ACCIDENT, OUR CAR INSURANCE COMPANY PAID FOR MORE THAN $7,000 FOR THE REPAIR OF THIS DAMAGE AND I PAID $1,000 FOR THIS COLLISION. WE KEPT BOTH THE POLICE AND REPAIR RECORD IN CASE YOU REQUIRED. AT THAT TIME WE DIDN'T REALIZE THIS ACCIDENT MAY BE CAUSED BY THE UNINTENDED ACCELERATE PROBLEM WHICH RECALLED .

MY CAR WAS A COROLLA 2005 CE [XXX]  WHICH HAS 4-CYLINDER AND ABOUT 67,000 MILES ON IT. AS I WAS DRIVING ON OLD HWY 75, I EXPERIENCED A SUDDEN ACCELERATION, THE CAR LURCHED AND PULLED ME TO THE DITCH ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE. I IMMEDIATELY LOOSEN THE ACCELERATION PAD BUT IT DIDN'T SLOW DOWN BUT ACCELERATED TOWARDS THE RIGHT HAND SIDE. THEN I WAS SCARED THAT IT WILL ROLL OVER IN THE DITCH AND SO I PULLED IT BACK TO THE LEFT, BUT THERE WAS A VAN COMING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION (NEXT LANE) AND THUS WE HAD A HEAD-ON COLLISION. THE TWO OLD LADIES INCURRED LEG INJURIES AND THEY COULDN'T COME OUT OF THE VAN. THE TWO BOYS (ABOUT 4 YEARS OLD) SEEMED FINE AND CAME OUT OF THE VAN. LATER ON THE TWO OLD LADIES NEEDED TO HAVE SURGERIES AND THEY FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST ME.   AT THAT TIME, I FELT THAT SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH MY COROLLA BUT I COULDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO FIND IT OUT BECAUSE I NEED THE INSURANCE COMPANY TO GET ME ANOTHER CAR FOR COMMUTING PURPOSES. HOWEVER, I FEEL THAT THIS ACCIDENT WAS DUE TO THE COROLLA THAT I WAS DRIVING AT THE MOMENT AND THUS IT WAS NOT COMPLETELY MY FAULT. COROLLA 2005 IS NOT IN THE RECALL LIST, BUT I STILL WANT TO FILE THIS REPORT AND I WILL SEEK LEGAL ADVICE IN TERMS OF LIABILITY. PLEASE CONSIDER MY COMPLAINT CAREFULLY BECAUSE I ALMOST DIED IN THE ACCIDENT AND GIVE ME A REPLY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  *TR",

CAR WAS TOTALED, SHE WAS NOT INJURED.  WE AT FIRST ASSUMED ROLLOVER OCCURRED BECAUSE BRAKING DURING SKID CAUSED THE ENGINE TO DIE LOCKING THE FRONT WHEELS CAUSING LOSS OF CONTROL.
