THE DEALERS SERVICE MANAGER RECOMMENDED I CONTACT FORD ENGINEERING TO ADVISE THEM OF THE FAILURE SINCE IT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE A MAINTENANCE OR WEAR RELATED ISSUE.  THE ENGINE HAD TO BE REPLACED WITH A JUNK YARD MOTOR AT A COST OF OVER $6000 SINCE THE PISTONS AND VALVES HAD DESTROYED THE ENGINE.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SERVICE BULLETINS, CONTACT FROM THE MANUFACTURER OR EVEN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THIS PROBLEM.  THERE ARE NO NEW FACTORY ENGINES AVAILABLE AND 3RD PARTY MOTORS WERE TWICE THE BLUE BOOK VALUE OF THE CAR.*AK    PLEASE INVESTIGATE THE SCOPE OF THIS PROBLEM AND REQUIRE THE MANUFACTURER TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THIS ENGINEERING FLAW.  THIS FAILURE IS A CATASTROPHIC ONE THAT DESTROYS AN ENGINE AND IS CERTAINLY SOLVABLE IF ADDRESSED EARLY ENOUGH.  MY FAMILY WAS MOST FORTUNATE THAT THIS PROBLEM DID NOT CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.",

WE WENT TO THE GAS STATION AND UNDER THE LIGHTS WE SAW ALOT OF SMOKE POURING OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD.  MY HUSBAND POPPED THE HOOD AND THERE WAS A FIRE!  WE BACKED THE VAN UP AWAY FROM THE GAS PUMPS AND EVERYONE GOT OUT FINE.  WE HAD TO USE A FIRE EXTINGUISHER TO GET THE FIRE OUT.  WE TOOK IT TO A DEALERSHIP AND THE TECHNICIANS THERE SHOWED US THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH WAS MESSED UP.  WE HAD THEM ORDER US A NEW PART AND WE REPLACED IT.  THE WIRING HARNESS IN THE VAN IS STILL DAMAGED AS WE DID NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO REPLACE IT.

SO, I'LL BE OUT FOR 1 WEEK & STILL HAVE A \"LEMON\" CAR. WHAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT IS THAT I DIDN'T HAVE $3200.00 FOR THIS CAR.

THE NOTICE STATED THAT IN CERTAIN HIGH CORROSION AREAS THE FRONT SPRINGS COULD FRACTURE AND RUPTURE THE TIRE.  IT WAS ANTICIPATED THAT IN DECEMBER 2004, KITS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THE FORD DEALERS TO INSTALL OVER THE SPRINGS TO PREVENT TIRE RUPTURE.  ON TUESDAY DEC. 21, 2004, I BROUGHT IN THE CAR TO THE DEALER FOR ROUTINE SERVICE (90,000 MILES).  I ASKED ABOUT THE KIT AND WAS TOLD THAT NONE WERE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  THE SERVICE ADVISOR STATED THAT I WOULD BE NOTIFIED WHEN THEY ARE IN, BUT I SHOULD BE OK.  AFTER THE CAR WAS SERVICED, I BROUGHT THE CAR HOME ON WEDNESDAY, DEC. 22, 2004.  IT THEN STAYED IN THE GARAGE AT HOME UNTIL TUESDAY MORNING DEC. 28,2004.  AT THAT TIME, I STARTED THE CAR TO GO TO WORK.  WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE, THERE WAS A LOUD BANG, AND THE CAR TILTED TO THE DRIVER'S SIDE.  I GOT OUT AND FOUND THAT THE TIRE HAD \"POPPED\".  I HAD AAA COME TO FIX THE TIRE.  THEY FOUND THAT THE SPRING HAD FRACTURED AND PUNCTURED THE TIRE.  FORD TOOK CARE OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS DAMANGED (REPLACED BOTH FRONT END PARTS AND THE TIRE) PROMPTLY.    MY CONCERN WITH THE RECALL IS THAT OTHERS MAY NOT NOT BE AS FORTUNATE AS I TO HAVE THE SPRING BREAK AND THE TIRE RUPUTURE IN THE GARAGE.

MY COMPLAINT IS THAT THIS SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED. WHY IS THERE NO SLACK GIVEN ON THE SEAT BELT ESPECIALLY IN A PARKED CAR. THE BELT SHOULD NOT KEEP LOCKING AND TAKING UP SLACK. THIS IS AN UNSEEN DANGER LURKING THAT COULD ENTRAP A CHILD. THE BELT WILL ENTRAP A CHILD WITHOUT BEING SECURED IN THE BUCKLE. BEWARE!!",

SINCE NOVEMBER 2002, WE HAVE HAD THE CAR AT TWO FORD DEALERSHIPS AND THREE INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOPS TRYING TO GET THE HEATER FIXED. SO FAR IT HAS COST US $1,324.21.  DURING THE MOST RECENT REPAIR, NORTH POINT FORD TOOK APART THE ENTIRE COOLANT SYSTEM, FLUSHED EACH COMPONENT AND FOUND RUST IN THE ENGINE BLOCK, WHICH THEY SAID WAS THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM.      AT PRESENT, THE HEATER IS WORKING, BUT WE FEEL WE ARE DUE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE REPAIRS. THE CAR WAS STILL UNDER THE MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY WHEN WE BOUGHT IT WITH 29,891 MILES. (THE CONTRACT STATES 28,890 AS THE DEALER DENIED OUR REQUEST TO LIST THE CORRECT MILEAGE.) WE PURCHASED AN EXTENDED \"BUMPER TO BUMPER\" WARRANTY AT A COST OF $1,733 AT NORTH POINT FORD. THE BIG SELLING POINT WAS THE WARRANTY WOULD COVER ALL MAJOR REPAIRS SUCH AS THE AIR CONDITIONER/HEATER SYSTEM.  THE WARRANTY IS HANDLED THROUGH WARRANTECH AUTOMOTIVE, P.O. BOX 1179, BEDFORD, TX 76095. THE CONTRACT #  IS 14747754; THE CONTRACT PLAN CODE IS CV60100UKD; THE SELLING DEALER CODE IS 718688 AND THE LOCAL AGENT CODE IS 183. HOWEVER, THE WARRANTY COMPANY HAS PAID VERY LITTLE TOWARD THE REPAIRS, CLAIMING THEY ARE \"MAINTENANCE.\"  I HAVE LOCATED SERVICE BULLETINS ON THE INTERNET. AMONG THEM IS #01-15-6 \"HEATER CORE - REPEATED FAILURE\" AND #01-11-6 \"COOLING SYSTEM - CORROSION/CONTAMINATION/OVERHEATING.\"  WE WERE ALSO TOLD THAT ON THE 1999 TAURUSES, FORD SENT THE VEHICLES FROM THE FACTORY WITH A HIGHLY CORROSIVE COOLANT. THIS WOULD EXPLAIN THE SERVICE BULLETINS ON THE HEATER CORE FAILURE AND COOLANT SYSTEM CORROSION.

I GAINED CONTROL AND BROUGHT THE CAR BACK INTO MY LANE AND NOTICED THAT MY LEFT FRONT CORNER WAS EXTREMELY LOW . FORTUNATELY, I DID NOT TOUCH THE BRAKE PEDAL AND I COULD FEEL THAT THE TIRE WAS STILL INFLATED. I DECIDED TO LET THE CAR SLOW DOWN SLOWLY SINCE THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC VISIBLE AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD WAS A WIDE GRASSY AREA. AT THIS TIME , THE LEFT FRONT TIRE BLEW BECAUSE THE SPRING HAD CUT THE INSIDE OF THE TIRE AND SENT ME SLIGHTLY INTO THE OTHER LANE AGAIN. I GENTLY TAPPED THE BRAKES AND STOPPED. IT WAS A BLESSING THAT IT HAPPENED THERE AT 5 A.M. AND NO VEHICLES WERE IN THE ONCOMING LANE AT THAT TIME. IN ANOTHER 5 MINUTES I WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTERING I-96 EASTBOUND AT 70 MPH WITH A LOT OF FAST TRAFFIC. IF I WERE IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF THIS FAILED OR DEFECTIVE PART, THE INVESTIGATION WOULD FOCUS ON ME. WAS I DRINKING? WAS I UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS? DID I FALL ASLEEP AT 5 A.M.? DID I HAVE A HEART ATTACK? WAS I USING MY CELL PHONE? MICHIGAN LAW STATES THAT THE OWNER OF A VEHICLE THAT IS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT IS LIABLE. MY NAME IS ON THE TITLE. FORD SAYS THAT THERE ARE \"PROGRAMS\"ON FRONT SPRINGS ON SOME VEHICLES BUT NOT MINE. ALL DAMAGE WAS COVERED ONLY BECAUSE I HAD PURCHASED FORD PREMIUM EXTENDED SERVICE CONTRACT. ALL OF THIS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME . I HOPE THIS SERVES AS A CATALYST IN GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF FORD'S SPRING PROBLEM THAT EXISTS ON OUR HIGHWAYS. WHEN I WAS PICKING MY CAR UP AT THE DEALER TODAY, A 1997 CONTOUR JUST ARRIVED WITH A \"CRACKED\" FRONT SPRING. PERHAPS THIS WAS A FREAK COINCIDENCE, FOR ALL OF THE 8 OR 9 FORD DEALERS THAT I SPOKE TO BEFORE I DECIDED WHO WOULD DO THE REPAIR, ASSURED ME THAT THIS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE OR RARELY HAPPENED.

WE TOOK THE CAR TO A FIRESTONE DEALER, WHO CALLED US BACK, AND ADVISED US TO TAKE THE CAR TO OUR DEALERSHIP. THEY WERE NOT SURE OF THE PROBLEM AND THOUGHT BEST TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP. ALSO ADVISED US TO CHECK INTO THIS PROBLEM FURTHER SINCE THE CAR WAS LOW IN MILEAGE. A FRIEND SUGGESTED WE LOOK AT YOUR WEBSITE TO SEE IF ANY OTHER CARS HAD THIS PROBLEM. WE DID AND FOUND 16 OTHER 1999 TAURUS REPORTING PROBLEM WITH POWER STEERING. THE NEXT DAY CAR WAS TAKEN TO ALDERMAN FORD, WE EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM- TOLD THEM ABOUT OUR FINDINGS ON YOUR WEBSITE AND THE PROBLEM WITH THE OTHER CARS. THEY SAID THEY WOULD CHECK INTO IF THE SAME PROBLEM FOUND MAYBE COULD HELP US OUT WITH COST. THREE DAYS LATER RECEIVED A CALL SAYING IT WAS THE POWER STEERING RACK- THE SAME PROBLEM REPORTED BY OTHERS TO YOUR AGENCY. THEY TOLD US THE BEST THEY COULD DO WOULD BE DO REDUCE THE PRICE BY APPROX. $200. OUR FINAL COST WAS STILL $820!!! WE EXPRESSED OUR DISPLEASURE WITH THIS, SPOKE WITH SERVICE MANAGER AND GENERAL MANGAGER. THEY SAID IF SUCH A KNOWN PROBLEM FORD WOULD PROBABLY HAVE DONE SOMETHING, AND THAT THEY HAD NOT SEEN THIS PROBLEM BEFORE. WE DO NOT HAVE MAINTENANCE RECORDS FOR THE CAR, MY HUSBAND DOES THE MAINTENANCE HIMSELF AND WE HAVE NOT DOCUMENTED IT. WE REALIZE OUR MISTAKE IN THIS PRACTICE. HOWEVER, I STILL CANNOT BELIEVE THIS PROBLEM IS HAPPENING TO MULTIPLE PEOPLE AND FORD IS DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT! I'VE HAD MANY FORDS, THIS IS MY SECOND TAURUS...AND AFTER THIS EPISODE WILL PROBABLY BE MY LAST. I REALIZE THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY, BUT THIS IS A HUGE EXPENSE FOR A CAR ONLY A FEW YEARS OLD.

CAN BE REPRODUCED WITH THE TRANSMISSION IN \"OD\"  AFTER THE CAR IS WARMED UP.  MIGHT EVEN BE WORSE ON COLDER DAYS (LESS THAN 50 DEG F).  IT'S LIKE THE SPEED CONTROL IS \"ON\"; THE RPMS ON THE TACHOMETER DON'T DROP, AND THE CAR CONTINUES AT THE SAME SPEED OR EVEN ACCELERATES!  YOU CAN'T COAST DOWN, IT REQUIRES BRAKING TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN.  IT ALSO SEEMS TO TAKE LONGER TO STOP - WHEN BRAKING - BECAUSE OF THE ENGINE WORKING AGAINST THE BRAKES.  ON ROADS THAT HAVE A SLIGHT DECLINE, IT REQUIRES YOU TO BRAKE OFTEN TO MAINTAIN THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT.  DRIVING THIS CAR IS JUST UNNERVING; I'M NOT USED TO USING THE BRAKES SO MUCH.  I'VE TAKEN MY CAR BACK TO MY FORD DEALER TWICE FOR THIS PROBLEM.  ON THE FIRST VISIT (3/16/99), THE SERVICE MANAGER TOOK MY CAR FOR A DRIVE AND AGREED MY CAR HAD A PROBLEM.  HE THEN GAVE ME AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE SECOND VISIT WHEN I LEFT THE CAR TO BE WORKED ON.  LATER THAT DAY, HE CALLED ME AT WORK TO TELL ME APOLGETICALLY, THAT FORD CONSIDERED THIS \"NORMAL\"; NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.  HE LEFT ME A COPY OF SSM#12066 (SPECIAL SERVICE MESSAGE) THAT STATES: \"1998-1999 TAURUS/SABLE 1998 & 1999 TAURUS/SABLE 3.0L 2-VALVE, 4-VALVE AND SHO VEHICLES CALIBRATED WITH INCREASED AIR FLOW AT CLOSED THROTTLE TO PREVENT TIP-IN-BUMPS.  A RESULT MAY BE REDUCED DECELERATION FEEL AND LESS ENGINE RPM REDUCTION AT CLOSED THROTTLE WITH THE VEHICLE MOVING....NO REPAIR SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED FOR THESE SYMPTOMS AS THEY ARE NORMAL.\"  SINCE FORD HAS AN SSM THAT ADDRESSES THESE SYMPTOMS OTHERS MUST ALSO HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS.  MY WIFE OWNS A 1997 FORD TAURUS, WITH EXACTLY THE SAME MOTOR AND TRANSMISSION AND IT DOES NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM.  IT DECELERATES WHEN YOU LIFT YOUR FOOT OFF THE ACCELERATOR UNDER ALL CONDITIONS.  I'VE ALREADY CONTACTED FORD BY LETTER AND HAVE TALKED TO THEM ON THE PHONE.  I HAVE LITTLE CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WILL BE FIX IT.",
