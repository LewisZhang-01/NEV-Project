WE TOOK IT INTO OUR LOCAL DEALER, PEARSON PONTIAC, GMS, OLDS IN SUNNYVALE, ON MARCH 21 2002.  AROUND THAT TIME BOTH MYSELF AND THE DEALER, AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I WAS TOLD, CALLED OLDSMOBILE CUSTOMER SERVICE ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE SINCE THE VAN WAS AT 41788 MILES, 5K MILES OUT OF MILEAGE WARRANTY, AND THE BELIEF ON MY PART THAT A MAJOR ENGINE REPAIR WAS NOT REASONABLE FOR A VAN WITH ONLY 41K MILES.  WHY SAY THE COOLANT CAN LAST 150K MILES WHEN IT ALL LEAKS OUT AT 41K MILES?  I WAS TURNED DOWN FOR ASSISTANCE SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  I BELIEVE I TALKED WITH JUSTIN AND THE CASE NUMBER WAS C06614725.  THE DEALER DIAGNOSED THE ISSUE AS A LEAKING INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET.  AT THE SAME TIME HE DETERMINED THE LIFTERS SHOULD BE REPLACED ALONG WITH A LEAKING WATER PUMP.  THE TOTAL COST WAS $1,709.72.  BREAKDOWN WAS $1,130.84 FOR LABOR AND THE REST FOR PARTS AND SALES TAX.  THE DEALER REPAIR ORDER NUMBER IS 56819.  I'VE NEVER OWNED OR HEARD OF A VEHICLE WHICH HAD A INTAKE MANIFOLD COOLANT LEAK, WATER PUMP AND LIFTERS FAIL AT 41K MILES.  MY WIFE AND I ARE NOT HARD ON OUR CARS.  THIS COST WAS HIGH (OVER 5% OF THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE) AND SOMETHING WE DID NOT EXPECT TO INCUR.",

I DOUBT I COULD INSTALL THE LIGHT ASSEMBLY SO, I'M LOOKING AT $100 OR $150 OR MORE TO INSTALL THEM FOR A TOTAL OF AT LEAST $300 TO $400. I CALLED THE 800 NUMBER AT OLDSMOBILE AND FILED A COMPLAINT. THEY CALLED ME BACK IN 15 MIN OR SO AND TOLD ME THERE'S NOTHING THEY COULD DO FOR ME, AND THAT IF I DIDN'T LIKE THE $91. EA FOR THE HEADLIGHTS THAT PERHAPS I SHOULD LOOK IN JUNK YARDS FOR HEADLIGHTS. WELL, THEY ARE MISSING THE PICTURE HERE, AS I FEEL THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY DEFECT. I HATE TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I WEERE TRAVELING AT 70 MILES PER HOUR ON A HIGHWAY LATE AT NIGHT WHEN THE \"SEALED COVERS\" FELL OFF LEAVING MY BULBS EXPOSED TO ALL THE ROAD HAZARDS. HAD I LOST MY LIGHTS AT A HIGH SPEED THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT, PERHAPS INJURIES AND DEATH AT THAT SPEED. I'M SURE GM IS NOT INTERESTED IN CORRECTING THE DEFECT AS THE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY AT $91. PER LIGHT IS A VERY PROFITABLE SALE. THE GLUE THAT WAS USED TO \"PERMANENTLY SEAL\" THESE HEADLIGHTS IS \"DEFECTIVE\" AND A MFG RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED TO INSURE THE SAFETY OF THOSE WHO OWN THE VANS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHO RIDE THE HIGHWAYS EXPOSED TO THIS POTENTIALLY DEADLY DEFECT.
