The hotter the vehicle gets the more vibration occurs. Now my alignment seems off and curves to the left when trying to drive straight. I have taken it in to Alamo Toyota and Red McCombs in San Antonio on many occasions with similar problems but all they are doing is balancing and rotation of tires. I have sent the dealership videos of the vibration but they indicate it\u2019s normal. This certainly does not appear normal and is now more of a safety issue. Not sure what else to do!",
