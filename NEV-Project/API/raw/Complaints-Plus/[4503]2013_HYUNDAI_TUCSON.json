This was previously recalled by Hyundai (19V063000) as potentially causing a sudden loss of power or rapid slowing of the vehicle during operation. The Hyundai dealership addressed that recall by placing RTV on the gasket. It appeared to fix the issue for a few months to a year. Then I noticed the vehicle was dripping oil and that it appeared to be coming from the oil pan gasket. The \"fix\" that Hyundai previously performed has stopped working resulting in the same safety issue as identified in the prior recall. My wife took the vehicle to a Hyundai dealership today and where they confirmed that it was leaking from the oil pan and quoted $396 to fix it. My wife was told that they would not remediate the safety issue since they already performed work for that recall and it had been a year. I feel this is a serious issue - that the work they did to resolve a safety recall has failed and they are unwilling to fix it. I wonder if the work to my vehicle was done correctly compared to others (did the remediation call for RTV to be used?), or if Hyundai did not take the correct approach to remediate the issue (should it have been a new, thicker gasket instead of the RTV?). In either case, the fix has failed and resulted in the same deficient safety condition stated in the prior recall.",

Vehicle was towed to a local certified and well known auto repair shop for $115.00. Owner of repair shop advised he looked for recalls and at that time, nothing was showing up for my vehicle and because the engine had 171,000 miles on it, we authorized him to locate the same engine (used) and install it. Cost to us, $5000.00. It wasn't until months (?) year (?) down the road that we received a recall notice from Hyundai; campaign recall 181. (Their letter's are not dated nor are the envelopes postmarked with dates, so I cannot provide those dates).  My vehicle was slated to be inspected on 12/3/21; I advised the dealership that it is not the original engine, but the vehicle never made it to the inspection. The weekend prior to 12/3/21 (Thanksgiving weekend of 2021), the vehicle stalled (engine seized) on the highway at 65mph; lost power steering and it had to be towed. Our cost $310. We have a video where you can hear the awful grinding noises it made during that time. This time we towed the vehicle to the dealership where they confirmed the engine seized. Hyundai denied any claim to the engine seize. This used engine had less than 100,000 miles on it when it seized. We expected they would fix this one, but they told the dealership that since we did not get the 1st engine fixed by the dealership they won't replace the 2nd engine for us.  We towed the vehicle back to our home where it is sitting.  Safety was definitely a concern at 65mph and engine seizing; lost power steering. The problem has been confirmed by the dealership.  No warning lights or messages; the grinding noise just came out of nowhere and the vehicle continued to lose power and stall on the side of the highway.",

It just all of a sudden started knocking while driving on the highway and I was lucky to get to the side of the road without causing an accident or being stuck in the middle of the highway with a broken engine. Checked the oil and found metal shavings on the dipstick so I called a tow truck to have the vehicle towed to the dealership that last serviced it. The dealership initially kept telling me it was upper engine noise until I pushed them to actually tell me which part failed. They then finally admitted that it was one of the engine bearings. This failure was also 2 months after that same dealership had pulled the oil pan off and replaced the gasket and oil pressure sensor for an active recall.

On Mon May 17, 2021 at 4pm EST our 23 year old daughter and 3 of her college graduate girlfriends were driving from Atlanta to Charleston, SC (65-70 mph) on Hwy I-26 when suddenly & without warning her 2013 Hyundai Tucson engine started knocking, smoking and ultimately exploded throwing a piston through the engine block creating a huge hole and completely seizing up.  She couldn't see due to the intense smoke, lost control of the car but thankfully was able to steer it to the roadside.   As the girls struggled to get out they saw fire underneath the car and highway shoulder.  They called 911. By the time the fire dept arrived, the fire had diminished but not before terrifying the 4 girls that the gas tank might explode.   Our daughter & friends were completely frantic stranded on the side of a major hwy.  After approx 1 1/2 hours, a County Sheriff drove by and stopped to assist.  He took them to the next exit to wait for the tow truck.  The vehicle was towed to Hyundai of North Charleston and inspected discovering a large gaping hole in the engine block.  We had to pay $599 to have the car shipped back to Atlanta on Mon May 25th.   On Thurs May 27, 2021, we went to Rick Case Hyundai in Roswell, GA and met with the GM.  It was his service center involved in our attempts on Jan 6, 2021 to get the car repaired as per Hyundai Recall 181 instructions.  We were told their was a national shortage of parts, received only an oil change and left driving a totally unsafe car which ultimately could have resulted in serious injuries or even loss of life to 4 young women.  The dealership should not have allowed the car to be driven and a loaner car provided until repairs completed. The 2013 Tucson is available for inspection upon request as it is a nonrunning, engine completely totaled, vehicle.",

LATER, DRIVING SOUTH ON I-5 WHILE IN THE FAR LEFT LANE AT 70 MPH, MY 2013 HYUNDAI TUCSON LIMITED EXPERIENCED A MAJOR ENGINE FAILURE, MANIFESTING WITH A TERRIBLE METAL CRASHING SOUND AND SHAKING.  I HAD TO IMMEDIATELY CROSS TWO LANES OF HEAVY TRAFFIC, HAZARDS FLASH, TAKING THE EXIT THAT WAS FORTUNATELY RIGHT THERE ON THE IMMEDIATE RIGHT.  I WOULD NOT HAVE MADE IT TO THE NEXT EXIT 1 MILE AWAY.  BY THE TIME I REACHED THE END OF THE RAMP AND PULLED INTO THE EMERGENCY PARKING, THE ENGINE WAS BARELY SPUTTERING, THE CAR BARELY ROLLING. NEXT DAY, UPON INSPECTION BY THE DEALER, THEY SAID METAL DEBRIS WAS FOUND IN THE ENGINE, SAME BEARING ISSUE AS THE OTHER ENGINE FAILURES THAT WERE RECALLED EARLIER (SANTA FE MODELS, SONATAS, ELANTRAS, AND OTHER TUCSONS).  MY MODEL AND TRIM PACKAGE ISN'T PART OF THE RECALL YET. ONE MONTH PRIOR, THE DEALER HAD DONE A SAFETY INSPECTION AND $1,000 OF WORK REPLACING THE DRIVE BELT, HOSES, AND THERMOSTAT GASKET SO THAT I WOULDN'T LOSE THE ENGINE, AS I WAS TOLD BACK THEN. SINCE I STILL LOST THE ENGINE ONLY ONE MONTH LATER AND WITHOUT ANY WARNING AND BECAUSE MY MILEAGE WAS OVER WARRANTY AT APPROX134K, THE DEALERSHIP SUBMITTED A REQUEST TO HYUNDAI FOR GOODWILL AND RENTAL CAR ASSISTANCE ON MY BEHALF. THE MANUFACTURER AGREED TO PAY 75% AND PROVIDE RENTAL CAR ASSISTANCE IF PARTS WERE ON NATIONAL BACK ORDER. IT WAS 3 WEEKS TO ORDER PARTS AND COMPLETE REPAIRS. NO RENTAL CAR ASSISTANCE. I PICK UP THE CAR TODAY. MY PORTION OF THE COST IS MORE THAN $2200.  IF THE 2013 TUCSON LIMITED IS ADDED TO THE RECALL LIST, WILL I BE ELIGIBLE FOR REIMBURSEMENT?",

I HAVE DONE RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT THAT THE ENGINE THETTA II HAS BEEN RECALLED BUT ON ONLY CERTAIN TYPES OF HYUNDAI AND KIA MODELS. EVEN THOUGH THE ENGINES ARE THE SAME, AND THE COMPLAINTS ARE THE SAME, AND THE FAILURES ARE THE SAME, THE TUCSON NEEDS TO BE ADDED.  WE TOWED THE VEHICLE TO HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP IN LITHONIA GEORGIA AND THEY TOOK ONE LOOK AT THE OIL DIPSTICK AND SAID THE REASON FOR THE ENGINE FAILURE WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO OIL. NOW WE HAVE THE VEHICLE SITTING IN OUR GARAGE AND WE DID FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND FOUND A BIG HOLE ON THE ENGINE BLOCK ITSELF, THAT EXPLAINS WHY HYUNDAI'S DEALERSHIP DIAGNOSIS WOULD REPORT NO OIL BECAUSE ALL THE OIL DRAINED OUT THROUGH THE GAPING HOLE IN THE ENGINE. HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP WANTS TO CHARGE US ANOTHER $7,000 TO REPLACE THE ENGINE. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE MANY MEMBERS ( HYUNDAI THETA II ENGINE FAILURE FACEBOOK GROUP) WHO HAVE BEEN WAITING 6 MONTHS AND ONGOING FOR A REPLACEMENT ENGINE. THEY KEEP POSTPONING BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO ENGINES BECAUSE THE ENGINES HAVE MANUFACTURER DEFECTS CAUSING A BEARING TO PREMATURELY FAIL RESULTING IN CATASTROPHIC ENGINE FAILURE. NOW OUR 2013 TUCSON SITS IN OUR GARAGE WHILE STILL MAKING PAYMENTS $16,000! THEY RECENTLY ADDED 2011-2013 TUCSON TO THE RECALL. FOR SOME REASON OUR 2013 IS NOT.?!!",
