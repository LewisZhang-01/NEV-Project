I looked at my 10 year old granddaughter, she was looking at me, she said what was that?  I said I don't know, but it happened again in about 1/4 mile down the road. We traveled about another 1/4 mile when the truck started sounding like a machine gun being fired!! My granddaughter started crying as she was scared, I pulled over into the emergency pull off to check my truck. It was running good now and NO ENGINE LIGHT was on. So I continued driving toward Clarksville, TN. although I considered turning back and heading home. I thought maybe it was water in the gas or something. After arriving in Clarksville to pick up my two grandsons we started home. As soon as I got on I-24 west the truck started the same thing again. Felt like we hit a big dog and then started sounding like a machine gun being fired. This time the ENGINE LIGHT DID come on. I was afraid the truck was going to quit running and there I was with 3 grandkids on a very busy I-24!! I contacted Patroit Chevrolet where I purchased the truck at. They told me it would be 6 weeks before they could look at my truck!!!! I hung up but called back as I was afraid that I couldn't make it home, the truck was running bad!! They found that it had dropped a lifter, it had only about 6,300 miles on it!!! They had it for about 3 weeks. Now, I find out that GM has had a lot of problems with these motors, \"A LOT of PROBLEMS\"!! I,m sure the problem WILL happen again, I am hoping no one gets killed when it does. THIS IS A DANGEROUS PROBLEM!!! GM needs to replace these motors or buy them back or something!!!",

        "summary": "My vehicle lost power to accelerate on an on ramp just before a bridge over the Wisconsin River and I was not able to merge into traffic.  I was nearly put into the guardrail just before the bridge and I had to wait for the semis and other vehicles to pass and give me an opening.  I drove straight to the closest GM dealership under reduced power.  I was accelerating and would have been able to easily merge until suddenly my engine seemed to stall/lose power significantly.  This caused me to slow down and not be able to get over as there were two semi trucks in the northbound lane of highway 39 in Kronenwetter WI.  I have now found out that the power failure is due to something that is, according to my rough calculations happening very frequently to my model of truck for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021.  I am curious to know how many trucks per year?  One dealership told me they do about 2 trucks per week in Wausau and a dealership in Green Bay WI told me 3 per week.  Rough math tells me that spanning 4500 certified GM service centers equals over 400000 vehicles per year.  When does this become a safety recall if not a general recall to protect consumers?  GM knows about this problem however they continue to put in the same faulty lifters in the vehicles and only fix/ put in upgraded lifters when they break.  How can a car manufacturer put vehicles on the road and sell them knowing there is a potential no only to break but in instances like mine or others I can't even envision, cause an accident or worse?",

Shortly after leaving the dealership, I pulled over to the side of the road and paired my cell phone with the vehicle.  It took several attempts to successfully accomplish this.  I then made a hands-free call and then proceeded to drive home.  Within a couple miles, I decided to make a U-turn.  Given the size of this vehicle, completing this U-turn required backing up. The moment I placed the transmission in reverse, the center display went blank and consequently no rearview image was displayed.  Even after I shifted the transmission back to Drive, the center screen (which is also used to display other things like the radio station, time, temperature, etc.) continued to remain blank.  However, the audio continued to function (noted at 1 minute and 15 seconds into the video).   I decided to make a video to document the condition prior to turning off the ignition as my experience has been that such malfunctions are likely associated with software errors that can be difficult to track down and replicate.  I drove this loaner vehicle several other times before returning it to the dealer. On each occasion, the rearview image displayed when the vehicle was put in Reverse.",

Was coming up to an intersection to make a left turn and went to press the brake pedal to slow down for the turn. Pedal went all the way to the floor and the truck wasn't slowing down much at all. Multiple brake system warnings and lights came on the dash along with the check engine light. It got towed to the dealership he bought it from. They replaced the brake system control module and said it's good to go. Maybe it is, maybe it's not. There have already been 2 recalls pertaining to this exact issue released, none of which applied to his truck according to the VIN recall checker on GM's website. If the problem has been figured out and fixed, then it wouldn't still be occuring. This is a MAJOR safety concern, one that I feel people need to be aware of. Which is why I'm sharing what happened to my friend's truck on behalf of him.   This situation is exactly why the emergency brake on vehicles is an all mechanical system that allows the driver to quickly and directly be able to apply the vehicles brakes. It's a reliable and dependable system that's been implemented for over a century. This is a prime example of why vehicles still need to have one onboard. This vehicle doesn't have a real emergency brake. There was an emergency in which the vehicles primary brakes failed and weren't able to slow down the vehicle. The little \"emergency brake\" button was more worthless than the main brakes that failed to do their job on this truck with less than 5,000 miles on it because the emergency brake system on this truck has worked 0% of the time it was needed so far. This isn't some engine misfire, sunvisor defect, or Bluetooth pairing problem, this is an out of nowhere total brake system failure. This is not good. And people need to be made aware that the problem is still occurring, and on vehicle's that GM isn't aware that it may be applicable to according to the absence of any recalls per VIN.",

Turning the feature back on in the infotainment screen actually turns the park assist button back on for about 5 seconds then it silently turns off and the driver is NOT warned that the system is not working.

This failure and poor awareness is a safety risk. Yes, we are unlikely to be parking super close to someone but we might indeed park near a GAS hot water heater or similar hazard in work trucks.

With auto thefts and break-ins at an all time high how can anyone ever feel safe locking valuables up in their vehicle.The Chevy dealership where I bought it first didn't believe me but later checked with Chevy and found out that Gm ran out of key codes so they started to reuse them. People in the business of stealing cars or stealing the contents probably can wander thru shopping malls or parking lots get in and out of cars without the owner aware of it. What are the odds that I would have a key that opens two different vehicles and how many other keys like that are out there?",

THE DEALERSHIP WAS ABLE TO HEAR THE NOISE AND ADVISED THAT THEY CANNOT FIND OUT WHERE THE NOISE IS COMING FROM. THE DEALERSHIP ADVISED THAT THEY SUBMITTED A TICKET TO GM FOR THE NOISE. ON 03022021/MILEAGE 2797 THE TRUCK WAS TAKEN BACK INTO THE DEALER FOR THE SAME NOISE BECAUSE ITS GETTING LOUDER. THE DEALER AGAIN SAID THAT THEY HEARD THE NOISE BUT CANNOT FIGURE IT OUT. THEY ADVISED THAT THEY SUBMITTED ANOTHER TICKET WITH GM WAITING TO HEAR BACK FROM THEM THEY CLOSED OUT THE TICKET ON 03102021 WITH NO ANSWER FROM GM. I HAVE ALSO CALLED GM CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SPOKE WITH ON 03102021, AND TOLD ME TO CALL THEM BACK BECAUSE THEY HAD TO TRY AND LET THE DEALER RESOLVE THE ISSUE AND THE DEALER IS WAITING TO HEAR FROM GM. THE DEALER DID ADVISE ME THAT THERE WAS A SERVICE BULLETIN FOR 2020 CHEVY 1500 PICK UPS BUT NOTHING FOR 2021S SO THEY CAN DO NOTHING YET, THE SOUND SOUNDS LIKE TO ME THAT THE AXELS ARE GOING TO COME LOOSE OR THE SUSPENSION IS GOING TO DROP. I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE FEARFUL THAT SOMETHING IS GOING TO COME OFF OR THE SUSPENSION IS GOING TO DROP IF I ATTEMPT TO TOW SOMETHING. THUS CAUSING PAIN, INJURY OR DEATH TO MYSELF OR ANOTHER INNOCENT PARTY. I AM CONSIDERING TAKING IT TO ANOTHER DEALER AGAIN TO SEE WHAT THEY SAY, BUT I FEEL THIS IS SAFETY CONCERN ALL PEOPLE WHO ARE HEARING THIS NOISE  ON THEIR 2021 CHEVY PICK UPS. I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT THIS TRUCK HAS NO SUSPENSION MODIFICATIONS OF ANY TYPE AND IS ALL STOCK. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO LOOK INTO THIS. ALSO ATTACHED ARE THE WORK ORDERS FROM THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP. THANK YOU AGAIN",
