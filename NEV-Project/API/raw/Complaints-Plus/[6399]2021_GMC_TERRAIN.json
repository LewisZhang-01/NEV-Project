        "summary": "I dropped my son off at school and he mistakenly took my car keys into school with him, and somehow I was able to drive all the way home, 4.5 miles, with no key in the car and no warning to stating the remote wasn't in the car. The issue with this is if I'd driven further, perhaps to another state, or even driven somewhere at night, I would have been stranded once I turned the car off. There was no indication that the remote wasn't in the car, and the car never cut off. I only knew the remote was gone once I arrived home and turned off the ignition. That's when the message displayed that the remote wasn't in the car. I had to call an Uber to go back to my son's school to get the key. This could have been a disaster had I driven further or not had the funds to get back to my son's school. Not to mention if a car thief had someone occupied my car and driven off in it. They could have gotten as far as they wanted (or gas would allow) before the car shut-off as long as they didn't turn off the car. I stopped at stop lights and stop signs and the car just kept going. The issue should be looked into and addressed immediately. This just occurred yesterday. The vehicle has not been inspected and this was the first time anything like that has happened. I normally receive a warning message if my remote isn't in the car even if it's just in the house. This is clearly a defect that needs to be fixed.",
