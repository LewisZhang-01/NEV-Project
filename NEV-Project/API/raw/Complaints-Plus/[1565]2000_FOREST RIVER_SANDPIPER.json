I TOOK THE RV BACK TO THE DEALER, FAMILY FUN RV, FOR INSPECTION AND WARRANTY REPAIR.  I WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAD ORDERED ME A NEW DOOR AND FRAME.  SOON AFTER, WITHOUT CONTACTING ME, THE DEALER WENT OUT OF BUSINESS AND HAD NOT REPAIRED THE DOOR.  IN JULY OF 2005, WHILE TRAVELING TO NEW MEXICO, I HAD NOTICED THAT THE BODY OF THE RV APPEARED TO BE BENDING IN THE MIDDLE.  WHEN I RETURNED FROM MY TRIP ON 7/24/05,  I CONTACTED FOREST RIVER WARRANTY DEPARTMENT.  THEY ADVISED THIS WAS A CHASSIS ISSUE WITH THE COMPANY THAT BUILT THE CHASSIS AND THEY WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE.  HE SAID THAT IT SOUNDED LIKE ONE OF THE ANCHOR BOLTS APPEARS TO HAVE BROKEN AND THAT HE HAD SEEN THE HAPPEN BEFORE.  HE ADVISED ME TO SEND HIM PHOTOS TO MRFORESTRIVER@PACBELL.NET  AND THE WOULD CONTACT THE CHASSIS DEALER AND LET ME KNOW WHAT COULD BE DONE.  AFTER SENDING SEVERAL E-MAILS WITH NO FURTHER RESPONSE, I CALLED AGAIN ON AUG 3, 2005.  THE FOREST RIVER WARRANTY REP ADVISED ME THAT HE HAD TALKED WITH HIS SUPERVISOR AND HE WOULD NEED MORE PHOTOS OF THE REAR AND UNDERSIDE OF THE RV.  I SENT THE PHOTOS TODAY AS I HAD TO WAIT TILL I WAS HOME DURING DAYLIGHT HOURS TO TAKE THE PHOTOS.  I AM AWAITING A RESPONSE TO MY CLAIM.  THIS APPEARS TO BE A BIG SAFETY ISSUE AND WAS APPARENTLY AN ISSUE WHEN I FOUND THE CRACKS IN THE DOOR FRAME RIGHT AFTER I PURCHASED THE RV.    *NM",
