THE REASON IT WAS HARD TO REMOVE WAS THAT A SHARP LONG PIECE OF THE FRONT COIL SPRING HAS BROKEN AWAY, AND PUNCTURED THE SIDEWALL OF THE TIRE.  WHEN THE TIRE AND WHEEL WERE FINALLY REMOVED, THE BROKEN COIL SPRING COULD BE SEEN SITTING ATOP THE FRONT STRUT. THE REMAINDER OF THE COIL SPRING HAD A LONG SHARP POINT THAT HAD SHOT DOWN OVER THE SPRING SEAT ON THE STRUT AND WAS PROTRUDING INTO THE WHEEL WELL AREA WHERE IT HAD DAMAGED THE TIRE.

THE BROKEN PIECE OF THE COIL SPRING WHICH WAS SEPARATED FROM THE REST OF THE SPRING WAS PULLED OFF OF THE STRUT AND PUT INTO THE CAR.

THIS ALSO OCCURS WHEN THE CAR HAS NOT BEEN USED FOR 2-3 HOURS AND THE CAR IS PUT INTO REVERSE, THEN FORWARD, THEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED.   RECENTLY THE BANGING SOUND IS BECOMING LOUDER - SO MUCH SO THAT IT ATTRACTS PEDESTRIANS' ATTENTION. THE DEALER SAID HE COULD NOT FIND A PROBLEM.  A SUBARU REGIONAL INSPECTOR SAID THERE IS NOTHING WRONG.  SUBARU CUSTOMER SERVICE TOLD ME TO LIVE WITH THE SOUND/PROBLEM.  I HAVE SPOKEN WITH OTHER SUBARU OWNERS AND THEY TELL ME THEY HAVE SIMILAR PROBLEMS AND THAT SUBARU DOES NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR PROBLEM.  THE CAR DOES STOP, BUT I AM AFRAID THAT ONE DAY THE BRAKES WILL FAIL WITHOUT ANY NOTICE.  ...  IN ADDITION THE BRAKES ARE VERY, VERY SPONGY/SOFT.  IT FEELS LIKE I AM STEPPING ON AN AIR MATTRESS  - THERE IS NO SENSATION OF STOPPING UNTIL THE BRAKE PEDAL OF ALMOST FULLY DEPRESSED.
