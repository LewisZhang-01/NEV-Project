IT TURNS OUT THE WATER PUMP MALFUNCTIONED ON A 2016 MOTORCYCLE. THE DEALER WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE WATER PUMPS STATING THE HARLEY HAS UPDATED THE WATER PUMPS SO OBVIOUSLY HARLEY IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE WATER PUMPS ON 2014-2016 TOURING LIQUID COOLED MODELS. THIS SAME INCIDENT HAPPENED TO MY FATHER ON A 2015 TRI GLIDE IN 2018. AFTER RESEARCHING THIS SITUATION IT APPEARS THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WHICH HARLEY IS AWARE OF YET NOT CORRECTING. THE WATER PUMP FAILURE PUTS THE OPERATOR AND PASSENGER IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION SHOULD THE WATER PUMP FAIL ON A BUSY EXPRESSWAY OR HIGHWAY.",

NOW THE TACHOMETER IS AT AROUND 1200 RPMS AND MY SPEEDOMETER IS AT 14 MPH. THERE'S ALSO SWELLING INSIDE THE GLASS DUE TO WATER FILTRATION I PRESUME WHICH HARLEY DAVIDSON DIDN'T SEAL THE SPEEDO AND TACH GAUGES REALLY WELL. I'M REALLY WORRIED DUE TO THIS AND ALSO WORRIED FOR MY FELLOW RIDERS LUCKILY I WAS GOING SLOW IN THE CITY BUT I'M AFRAID THIS COULD HAPPEN TO OTHER RIDERS GOING AT HIGH SPEEDS. I ALSO SEARCHED ONLINE AT MANY HARLEY DAVIDSON FORUMS AND SAW MANY PEOPLE WITH THIS ISSUE. WHILE THIS HAPPENED THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION AND IN A CITY STREET AROUND 3:40PM WHEN I LEFT WORK.
