THE DOOR HINGE WAS DRILLED IN THE WRONG PLACE, BUT INSTEAD OF REPLACING THE FRONT PANEL AND RE-DRILLING THE DOOR HINGE IN THE RIGHT PLACE, PACE AMERICAN RE-DRILLED THE DOOR (RIGHT NEXT TO THE ORIGINAL HOLES) WITH ADDITIONAL HOLES THAT OVERLAPPED THE ORIGINALS.  THIS CONDITION WOULD NEVER ALLOW THE PROPER TORQUE TO BE APPLIED TO THE HINGE.  THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.  *JB",
