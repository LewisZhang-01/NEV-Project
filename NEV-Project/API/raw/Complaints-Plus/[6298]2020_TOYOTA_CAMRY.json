        "summary": "I purchased this vehicle on 01/12/2021 from Toyota of Greenville, SC.   I was initially told that the vehicle was a Certified Pre-Owned Toyota, which means it went through an intensive reconditioning process and passed all certification requirements. As I was signing the papers to purchase the car, I was told that it could not be sold as a Certified vehicle because it has the open manufacturer recall #20TA02.   It has been almost 9 months and I have not received any notice of a pending fix for this potentially deadly recall, summarized below.   SUMMARY: The subject vehicles are equipped with a low-pressure fuel pump which may stop operating. If this were to occur, warning lights and messages may be displayed on the instrument panel, and the engine may run rough. This may result in a vehicle stall, and the vehicle may be unable to be restarted. SAFETY RISK: If a vehicle stall occurs while driving at higher speeds, this could increase the risk of a crash. REMEDY: Any authorized Toyota dealer will replace the low-pressure fuel pump with an improved one FREE OF CHARGE.  I am hesitant to take the vehicle on a long trip or take it on the highway. I do not want to be stranded during my trip or die if the fuel pump shuts off at high speed. I have been purchasing Toyota products since 2000. I am feeling very abused and and neglected buy what I thought was a safe and reliable brand. I will be in the market for another vehicle soon. Now, I am not sure Toyota is the only brand to consider. Please let them know that I am not a happy customer because of this ongoing problem with their Number 1 Selling vehicle.

THE TOYOTA TECHNICIAN STATED THE BATTERY WAS GOOD AFTER PERFORMING A BATTERY TEST USING TOYOTA DCA8000 TEST.

OK THIS WAS SUPPOSE TO BE THE FIX TO MY PROBLEM. ON AUG 19 THE SAME ISSUE HAPPENED AGAIN. AGAIN I HAD MY CAR TOWED TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP. AFTER A SERIES OF TEST THEY STATED IT WAS THE BATTERY, SO THEY REPLACED THE BATTERY WITH A NEW BATTERY. I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT COULD BE THE BATTERY WHEN THIS IS A BRAND NEW CAR WITH LESS THAN 12,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE. . ON JAN 25, 2021 MY VEHICLE WAS PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY AND MY CAR WOULD START.

TECHNICIAN ADVISE THE NEXT DAY HAD  PERFORM A DCM RESET AND FIRMWARE UPDATE FOR DRAINING BATTERIES TO THE 2020 CAMRY.

SO I DON'T HAVE FINAL CONTROL OVER THE BRAKING EVEN UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS.    THE OTHER CONDITION THAT CONCERNS ME IS THE LAST DIAGRAM WHEN THE PUMP IS INTENSIFYING THE BRAKING FORCE. NOW THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER PATH FOR SOME OF THIS PUMPED FLUID TO RETURN TO THE INPUT SIDE OF THE PUMP. IF THE LEAKAGE PATH HAD NO RESISTANCE THEN THE PUMP COULD BE RECIRCULATING ALL OF THE BRAKE FLUID RESULTING IN NO BRAKING. I HOPE THAT THE LEAKAGE PATH HAS ENOUGH RESISTANCE THAT A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF BRAKE FLUID IS ENDING UP AT THE BRAKE PADS.    THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS IMPACTING MY CAR BUT I THINK IT'S A RISK TO ALL CARS WITH ABS.
