The first concern is that as you go over the agreement the cost of the vehicle is well over the actual blue book value which $24,000 plus. But then there is the blinded words which cover the interest rate and the false mathematics that is used to confuse you. I realized that in the end of that process it is stated that I would owe $70,000 plus which one can buy 3,4, vehicles or a home. I ask that this transaction  be investigated. My ethnicity was the motivating factor to become victimized just the commission. My second complaint which also support my reasonings as to this filing is due to the lack of reply towards the recall ( NHTSA- 20V764) Manufacture Recall Number:N202308930. I called the GM Manufacture on 07/27/2021 and was told that  the Remedy was not yet available. It has been over a month period . According to the initial date the Recall came effect which was Dec. 10/2020 it has now been 2 years 14 days sense recall  and I have yet to receive relief about this serious safety issue. I am asking for an investigation to initiated. It is not good the way consumers are being manipulated for monies we work hard for as good unfortunate Citizens. The 3rd incident occured when I was traveling east on 40-E going to work I felt the rear of the vehicle drop low( downward) which caused me to lose traction i need the recall completed Thank you.",

No defrost can cause significant visibility issues, which put the safety of the driver, passengers and others at risk.   This malfunction also creates a safety issue because the vehicle is unable to be heated up properly when temperatures drop.

THE DIAGNOSIS WAS THE ENTIRE EPS GEAR BOX HAD TO BE REPLACED WITH A COST NEAR $2500. I WAS STUNNED. I COMPLAINED TO THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT BECAUSE OF THE CARS AGE & ELAPSED MILES, THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED! I FURTHER STATED THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS MIGHT HAPPEN AFTER 10 YEARS & 100K MILES, BUT NOT BEFORE!! HE REPLIED THE CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THAT FAILURES LIKE THIS CAN HAPPEN. EVENTUALLY THE CAR WAS SATISFACTORILY REPAIRED, COPY OF THE BILL ATTACHED. MY CONTENTION IS THAT THIS IS NOT ONLY A RELIABILITY ISSUE, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY A SAFETY ISSUE. WHEN MY WIFE & I PURCHASED THE CAR, WE WERE BOTH RETIRED AND DID NOT HAVE THE DAILY GRIND OF DRIVING TO/FROM WORK IN ALL KINDS OF WEATHER. IN FACT THE CAR WAS DRIVEN MINIMALLY IN ADVERSE CONDITIONS.
