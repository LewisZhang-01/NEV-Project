I AM A MOTORCYCLE MECHANIC AND HAVE PROPERLY BLED THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM WITH VERY LITTLE SUCCESS. AFTER THE BLEED PROCEDURE, I CAN FEEL A VERY SLIGHT DRAG WHEN THE PEDAL IS DEPRESSED TO ITS MAXIMUM. NO WHERE NEAR ENOUGH PRESSURE TO STOP THE MOTORCYCLE ON A STEEP INCLINE FROM A STOP. WHICH IS WHERE IT'S NEEDED MOST. FROM A STOP, ON A HILL I REPLY ON THE REAR BRAKE AND NOW I AM FORCED INTO A DANGEROUS SITUATION OF MODULATING THE FRONT BRAKES AND OPERATING THE THROTTLE TOGETHER WITH THE SAME HAND. THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE AMOUNG ALL OWNERS OF THIS MODEL AS A QUICK INTERNET SEARCH WILL PROVE. PLEASE HELP US!!",
