JUST GOT OFF OF FREEWAY GOING 60 MPH!  BADLY DAMAGED LEFT FRONT INNER WHEEL WELL.  TIRE REMAINED INFLATED AND I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE OFF ROAD TO SAFETY.   STARTED WITH FRONT SHIMMY AND PULL TO THE RIGHT WHEN BRAKING, THAT GOT WORSE OVER ABOUT A WEEK OF DRIVING. I EXAMINED FRONT TIRES FOR ABNORMALITIES BUT FOUND NONE.  AFTER THE TREAD SEPARATED, THE TREAD LOOKS GOOD WITHOUT EXCESSIVE WEAR OR WEAR PATTERNS. LOOKS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF A RETREAD TIRE. I THEN EXAMINED OTHER THREE TIRES (SAME BRAND AND SIZE OF SUBJECT TIRE) AND FOUND WHAT APPEARS TO BE TREAD SEPARATIONS OF THE TREAD WHERE TREAD MEETS THE SIDEWALL.",

I HAVE 6 VOLVO 240S AND ALL OF THEM HAVE HAD FAILURES OF WALMART TIRES.  GOODYEAR, DOUGLAS AND UNIROYAL.  185 -70 - 14.   IN EVERY CASE THE TIRES GO OUT-OF-ROUND AND CANNOT BE BALANCED.  THEY WOBBLE AND SHAKE, BECAUSE OF BUBBLES IN THE SIDEWALLS AND THE TREAD FACE, OR FLAT SPOTS IN THE TREAD FACE, WHERE THE BELTS OR BANDS INSIDE THE TIRE ARE SEPARATING AND THE TIRE STRUCTURE ITSELF IS FAILING.  IN EVERY CASE THE TIRES ARE A FEW MONTHS OLD AND STILL HAVE THE BRAND NEW MOLD NIPPLES, AND THE TREAD DEPTH IS ALMOST BRAND NEW.   I HAVE TAKEN THE CARS TO FRONT END ALIGNMENT SHOPS AND NONE OF THEM NEEDED SUSPENSION PARTS OR ALIGNMENT - IT HAS BEEN TIRE FAILURE SHAKING THE CARS.  *TR",
