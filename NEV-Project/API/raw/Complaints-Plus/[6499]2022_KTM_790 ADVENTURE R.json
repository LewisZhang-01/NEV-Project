        "summary": "The motorcycle currently has 400 miles on it. Ever since getting the motorcycle home and when first cranking it in the morning (cold start) it will only run on one cylinder (has two cylinders) for a moment and then die. It takes numerous starts and will finally continue running on one cylinder for about 30 to 60 seconds at a very low RPM before the other cylinder starts. After that it runs normal. I've contacted KTM USA to voice my concern with no remedy to the problem. This doesn't give me much confidence when riding. If the motorcycle was too stop running on both cylinders while riding this could be dangerous situation. There have been no warning messages prior to the failure. This problem has been reported by numerous owners. Mine is available for inspection.",
