LONG STORY SHORT, IT HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP FOUR TIMES AND THEIR ARE STILL PROBLEMS WITH THE FRAME. THE PROBLEM IS THE WELDS KEEP BREAKING ON THE FRAME. THE SHOP TOLD ME I WAS LUCKY, THAT WITH THE WAY THE WELDS ARE BREAKING, THE WHOLE UNIT COULD HAVE FALLEN APART OR OFF THE FRAME WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY. STILL NOT SURE HOW TO FIX THIS. THERE WERE NO INCIDENTS CAUSED THE FAILURE. SO FAR IT HAS COST CLOSE TO $8000.00 IN REPAIRS AND IT STILL BREAKS. UPON GOOGLING THIS PROBLEM, THERE ARE MANY HITS WHERE ALL STATE THE SAME PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM IS THE  FRAME IS TOO WEAK TO SUPPORT THE TRAILER'S WEIGHT. MY REPAIR SHOP CALLED ME AND SAID THEY HAVE ANOTHER KEYSTONE TRAILER THAT JUST CAME IN FOR THE SAME PROBLEM. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES IN A SMALL TOWN FOR THAT TO HAPPEN? ON A SIDE NOTE, I HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE TIRES, THEY KEPT BLOWING. I NOTICE MANY MANY RV MANUFACTURES PUT TIRES ON WITH MINIMAL CLEARANCE FOR THE WEIGHT OF THE TRAILER, AND ALSO PUT AXLES THAT ARE BARELY RATED FOR THE TRAILERS AS WELL. YOU PUT A PILLOW IN THE TRAILER AND YOU ARE OVER YOUR AXLE AND TIRE WEIGHT RATING. I INSTALLED TIRES OF THE NEXT LOAD RATING UP AND HAVE NOT HAD A SINGLE PROBLEM. I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE TIRES ON MY PREVIOUS TRAILER, A NUWA FIFTH WHEEL. THEY KEPT BLOWING AND FINALLY I REPLACED THEM ALL WITH THE NEXT SIZE UP. THIS PROBLEM TRULY IS A ROAD HAZARD, HAVING A BLOW OUT ON A RV GOING 65MPH ON THE FREEWAY. ALSO, THE PROBLEM OF HAVING THE TRAILER FALLING OFF A FAILED FRAME WHILE TRAVELING ON THE FREEWAY. *TR",
