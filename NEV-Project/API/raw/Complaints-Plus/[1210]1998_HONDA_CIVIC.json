IF IT DOES CRANK, WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY, THE CAR WOULD CUT OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC. THAT WAS VERY DANGEROUS. YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL & KEEP TURNING THE SWITCH UNTIL IT FINALLY CRANKS BACK UP. NEXT, THERE IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE EXTERIOR LIGHTING. THE FUSE BLOWS ABOUT  3 TIMES A WEEK & HAS TO BE REPLACED SO THAT THE HEADLIGHT & BRAKE LIGHTS WOULD WORK. EVERYTIME THE FUSE BLOW & THE LIGHTS STOP WORKING, THE CAR WONT GET INTO GEAR UNLESS U UNLOCK THE GEAR SHIFT EVERYTIME U PUT IT IN PARK.  THEN THERE IS THE TRANSMISSION. I HAVE PUT 2 TRANSMISSIONS IN THIS CAR IN LESS THAT A YEAR. WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THIS CAR?  *TR",

I ASKED DEALER TO SPLIT THE COST WITH ME WHICH I HAVE HEARD HAS WORKED FOR SOME OTHER PEOPLE WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM.  THEY REFERRED ME TO CENTRALIZED HONDA CUST SRV WHICH DENIED MY REQUEST.  MEANWHILE I HAVE FOUND THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ON SEVERAL TRANSMISSION REBUILDER SITES REGARDING  MY TRANSMISSION MODEL (B4RA):  \"COMMON COMPLAINTS IN THE A4RA, B4RA, AND M4RA TRANSMISSIONS ARE HARSH UPSHIFTS, DOWNSHIFTS AND FORWARD ENGAGEMENTS, WHILE REVERSE ENGAGEMENT IS FINE. THESE PROBLEMS CAN BE CAUSED BY A BROKEN CPC (CLUTCH PRESSURE CONTROL) VALVE SPRING. THE SPRING IS LOCATED IN THE SECONDARY VALVE BODY, AND NOT AVAILABLE FROM HONDA. SONNAX HAS DEVELOPED A REPLACEMENT SPRING 88894 THAT HAS A WIRE DIAMETER LARGER THAN THE OEM DESIGN. THIS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE STRESS ON THE SPRING, PREVENTING FUTURE BREAKAGE.\"  TO ME, THIS SUGGESTS THAT THIS MODEL OF HONDA TRANSMISSIONS CONTAINS A FAULTY PART, RESULTING IN MUCH HIGHER THAN NORMAL TRANSMISSION FAILURES.  I BELIEVE THAT HONDA SHOULD STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS & EXTEND THE WARRANTY FOR THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS AFFECTED BY THIS PROBLEM & NOT JUST PROVIDE RANDOM GOODWILL ASSISTANCE TO A SELECT FEW WHO COMPLAIN THE LOUDEST.  HONDA'S DENIAL THAT THIS IS EVEN A PROBLEM (EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A TSB IDENTIFYING A HUGE GROUP OF POTENTIALLY AFFECTED CARS & TRANSMISSION REBUILDERS HAVE SEEN THE PROBLEM SO OFTEN THAT ANOTHER COMPANY HAS ACTUALLY SEEN FIT TO CREATE A BETTER REPLACEMENT PART) HAS TURNED ME FROM A VIRTUAL HONDA EVANGELIST TO A VERY DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER WHO WOULD BE HARD-PRESSED TO PURCHASE ANOTHER HONDA.*AK",

COMPLAINED OF I REMOVED THE HEAT SHIELD FROM THE ENGINE TO INVESTIGATE THE SOURCE OF THE EXHAUST LEAK.  I FOUND THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD HAD SPLIT APPROX. ON EACH SIDE OF THE \"Y\" FOR A TOTAL CRACK OF 6 INCHES.  THIS WAS ALLOWING LARGE AMOUNTS OF EXHAUST GAS TO ENTER THE CABIN WHEN USING THE HEATER OR A/C.    I WAS INFORMED BY FOUR HONDA DEALERS LOCALLY THAT THE PROBLEM WAS WELL KNOWN AND ALL 7 LOCAL DEALERS HAD MANY MANIFOLDS IN STOCK IN THEIR PARTS DEPARTMENT.  THIS WAS AN INDICATION TO ME THAT MANY OF THESE WERE BREAKING AND I WAS FAR FROM ALONE ON THIS ISSUE.  THE REPLACEMENT MANIFOLD PART NUMBER IS- 18160-P2E-A12.

THE NEXT DAY, I CONTACT PARAGON HONDA TO SCHEDULE THE CHECK-UP.   MAY 13, 1998 - I TOOK THE CAR TO PARAGON HONDA AND RELATE THEM MY COMPLAIN.  THEY TEST DRIVE IT AND FOUND ALL OK AT THAT TIME  (I HAVE THE INVOICE NO. 85016 DTD. 5/14/98).  THE WEEKEND (MAY 17, 1998) WHEN I USED THE CAR, THE SAME PROBLEM HAPPENED AGAIN.  I FEEL VERY VERY SCARED BECAUSE I ALMOST GOT INTO ACCIDENT.  I HAD TO PUMP SEVERAL TIMES AND STILL IT DIDN'T WORK AT ALL.  SAME REMEDY, I USED THE HANDBRAKES TO STOP IT.   MAY 18, 1998 -  THIS TIME I TALKED AND INSISTED WITH THE PARAGON MANAGER THAT THEY SHOULD REALLY TEST AND CHECK THE CAR BRAKES FOR SEVERAL DAYS.  THEY ROADTESTED THE CAR FOR 163 MILES, AND FOUND EVERYTHING NORMAL.  AFTER COUPLE OF MONTHS, IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  THIS TIME I WAS HESITANT TO TAKE THE CAR BACK TO HONDA DEALER BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  I WAS SO BUSY WITH MY BUSINESS THAT I HAD NO TIME TO GO TO THE DEALER AND FIGHT FOR MY RIGHT TO HAVE MY CAR FIXED.  I DECIDED LATER ON TO GO TO A CONSUMER COMPLAINT BUREAU TO ASK FOR ADVISE AS TO WHAT TO DO, TILL I TRIED TO CHECK YOU ON THE INTERNET.  LAST MONTH OF NOVEMBER, IT HAPPENED AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK WHEN I'M DRIVING AT 25-30 MPH.  THIS TIME, I DECIDED TO TAKE A SERIOUS ACTION ON THIS PROBLEM.
