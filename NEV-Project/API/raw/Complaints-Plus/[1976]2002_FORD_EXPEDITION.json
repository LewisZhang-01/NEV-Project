The contact was able to extinguish the fire with water. An independent mechanic came to the contact's residence and diagnosed that the failure was related to NHTSA Campaign Number: 05V017000 (Vehicle Speed Control) however, the contact did not receive notification of the recall. The mechanic informed the contact that the speed control deactivation switch caused the fire that damaged the hydraulic control unit and the pigtail. The vehicle was towed to the dealer. The dealer confirmed that the failure was related to the recall. However, the dealer denied the recall repair since the recall was open for many years but was left unrepaired. The contact stated that she had owned the vehicle for a couple of months and was not aware there was a recall. The vehicle was not repaired and remained at the dealer. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 146,457.",

THEIR REPAIR SHOPS WILL CHARGE ANYWHERE FROM $400 TO $1600 TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM. PLEASE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BEFORE MY REMAINING 4 CYLINDERS GO AND I WILL HAVE TO PAY TO GET THIS BAD DESIGN REPAIRED.

THE MEDICAL FACILITY ANNOUNCED A CAR ON FIRE WITH DESCRIPTION AND I RAN OUTSIDE AND CALLED 911 BUT FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED AS I WAS STILL ON THE PHONE.    THANKS TO THE LIGHTNING SPEED OF RB FIRE THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO ANYTHING EXCEPT MY VEHICLE. THE FIREFIGHTERS ON THE SCENE TOLD ME THAT THEY SUSPECTED THE CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH.    IT ONLY BURNED INSIDE THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT - IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER SIDE.  AN INDEPENDENT FIRE INVESTIGATOR DETERMINED AFTER COMPLETING HIS INVESTIGATION THAT THE VEHICLE FIRE WAS DUE TO A FAULTY CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH AND BRAKE FLUID HAD LEAKED INTO THE ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT THAT IS ALWAYS ON FOR THE CRUISE CONTROL.  THE VEHICLE WAS STILL DECLARED A TOTAL LOSS BY MY INSURANCE COMPANY DUE TO HIGH REPAIR ESTIMATES.  ON 8/5/2008 MY INSURANCE COMPANY PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM ME FOR A LITTLE OVER THE KBB PRIVATE PARTY VALUE DUE TO RECENT VEHICLE ADD-ONS I PROVIDED RECEIPTS FOR.

YESTERDAY, 17 SEP 07, MY CRUISE CONTROL MALFUNCTIONED.  THE BRAKE SENSING SWITCH AT THE MASTER BRAKE CYLINDER AND THE CRUISE CONTROL WIRING HARNESS COMING OUT OF THE SWITCH WERE SOAKED WITH BRAKE FLUID.  BRAKE FLUID WAS ALL OVER THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  I DISCONNECTED THE WIRING HARNESS THE AREA OF THE SWITCH INTO WHICH THE WIRING HARNESS WAS PLUGGED WAS FULL OF BRAKE FLUID.  BRAKE APPLICATION CAUSED BRAKE FLUID TO LEAK OUT OF THE SWITCH.

THEY CALLED CORPORATE REGARDING PAYMENT ISSUES.  I WAS INFORMED THAT FORD WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIR BILL.  THIS SPECIFIC COMPLAINT IS NOT ABOUT THE BILL PER SE, BUT ABOUT MY CONCERN FOR SAFETY.  AS IT TURNED OUT, THE NEW FUSED HARNESS DID NOT BLOW THE FUSE--FORD DID NOT REPLACE THE HARNESS.  I AM NOW CONCERNED THAT THE \"HOT\" FUSED WIRING HARNESS WAS ATTACHED TO THE BRAKE SENSOR WHILE IT WAS COMPLETELY IMMERSED IN BRAKE FLUID.  THERE IS STILL A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF FIRE.

SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUES ARE: IS THERE STILL A RISK OF FIRE WHEN THE BRAKE SWITCH BRAKES/LEAKS AND, WHAT IS THE SAFETY IMPLICATION WITH REGARDS TO BRAKING GIVEN AN INCREASED RISK OF FAILURE AND SUBSEQUENT LEAKAGE OF THE BRAKE FLUID AT THE SWITCH? *TR",

WE ALSO NOTICED OUR DASH LIGHTS FLASHING.  WE TOLD HIM TO ALSO FIND OUT WHAT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM ALSO.  WE RECEIVED A CALL FROM HIM LATER IN THE DAY AND HE ADVISED US THAT HE CALLED THE DEALERSHIP WHO ADVISED HIM THAT THERE'S AN OVERLAYMENT OF METAL BEHIND THE WINDSHIELD THAT FORD FAILED TO SEAL CORRECTLY AND THE WINDSHIELD WASN'T SEALED CORRECTLY SO WHEN IT RAINS OR SNOWS, THE WATER SEEPS THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD AND FILLS THE PILLARS WITH WATER.  THE OVERFLOW OF WATER FROM THE PILLARS IS WHAT DRIPS THROUGH THE VISOR HINGES.  SOME OF THE WATER LEAKS INTO THE WIRING IN THE DASHBOARD AND OTHER PLACES.  FORD ADVISED THERE IS NO RECALL FOR THIS.  WE FOUND SOMEONE ELSE HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM FROM A PETRINA COMPTON @ MY3CENTS.COM WHICH SHE ADVISED OF A \"SPECIAL MESSAGE\" SENT DIRECTLY FROM FORD TO ALL FORD DEALERSHIPS IN APRIL OF 2002 WHICH STATES 1997-2002 EXPEDITIONS  MAY EXHIBIT ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS DUE TO WATER LEAKING IN THROUGH INCORRECTLY SEALED WINDSHIELDS.  SPECIAL MESSAGE #15773.  IF FORD IS ALREADY AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND THEY ADMIT THEY ARE AWARE OF IT IN SO MANY YEARS OF MODELS, WHY HAS THERE NOT BEEN A RECALL ON THIS?  I FEEL THAT THIS DEFECT WILL BE A POTENTIAL SAFETY HAZARD WHILE OPERATING VEHICLE WHEN THE ELECTRICAL FAILS OR CAUSES A SHORT IN THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AND CAUSES A FIRE.    PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO INVESTIGATE THIS DEFECT.  I'M SURE THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER OWNERS WHO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM BUT DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN OR HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THEIR MECHANICS AND DEALERSHIPS THAT THEY CANNOT LOCATE THE PROBLEM.  *JB",

IT WAS A VERY DANGEROUS EXPERIENCE FOR ME AND MY FAMILY AND OTHER DRIVERS AROUND ME.   I HAVE SINCE LEARNED THAT FORD IS AWARE OF THIS OBVIOUS MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND HAS DONE NOTHING TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING AND DOES NOT STAND BEHIND ITS PRODUCT.  THE ATTACHED LETTER WAS SENT TO FORD MOTOR COMPANY.  I PURCHASED A 2002 FORD EXPEDITION BRAND NEW FROM SYOSSET FORD ON LONG ISLAND.  AFTER FOUR YEARS AND 62 THOUSAND MILES, I WAS TOLD BY TOWER FORD OF GREAT NECK THAT I BLEW A SPARK-PLUG OUT OF THE ENGINE HEAD.  THEY REQUESTED THAT I CHANGE THE ENTIRE ENGINE SINCE THERE MAYBE CYLINDER DAMAGE, AND ALSO I WOULD NOW HAVE A NEW WARRANTY FOR MY ENGINE.  BEFORE SPENDING $5,253.34, I LOOKED INTO THE PROBLEM WITH OTHER CUSTOMERS ON THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC AND SAFETY ADMINISTRATION AND FOUND OUT THAT OTHER PURCHASERS OF THIS ENGINE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND FORD HAS DONE NOTHING TO COMPENSATE THEM OR FIXED THE ENGINES PROBLEMS.  THEY KNOW THIS IS A PROBLEM IN THIS PARTICULAR ENGINE AND CONTINUE TO USE IT, EVEN THOUGH, FORD STATES THAT NO TUNE-UP IS NEED ON THIS ENGINE FOR 100,000 MILES.  IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THIS IS A MANUFACTURER??S DEFECT IN THE ENGINE AND NOTHING IS BEING DONE ABOUT IT.   AT THIS POINT, I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO HAVE A NEW ENGINE INSTALLED OR JUNK A $39,000 SUV.   TOWER FORD REPLACED THE ENGINE IN SEPTEMBER.     NOW HERE I AM AGAIN, THREE MONTHS AND 4,900 MILES LATER I HAD TO CHANGE THE FRONT BLOWER MOTOR FOR $335.09.  IN MARCH TWO MONTHS AND 2,100 MILES LATER, TOWER FORD TELLS ME THAT SPARK-PLUGS ONE AND TWO, AND COILS ONE AND TWO, NEED TO BE REPLACED AND THIS IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY FOR MY NEW ENGINE AND IT WILL COST ME $488 PLUS TAX.

WE PAID AN ADDITIONAL $335 FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE STARTER. WE CARRIED THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE GLASS DELEARSHIP AND HAD THEM RUN A \"WET\" TEST WITH MY HUSBAND AS A WITNESS.

I STARTED THE ENGINE AND IMMEDIATELY HEARD A LOUD THUMPING NOISE FROM UNDER THE HOOD AND COULD SMELL GASOLINE.  I IMMEDIATELY SHUT OFF THE ENGINE AND LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD AND NOTICED THAT A SPARK PLUG COIL PACK WAS MOVED OUT OF PLACE AND THE RETAINING SCREW BRACKET WAS BROKEN OFF THE COIL PACK ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE ENGINE.  I PULLED THE COIL PACK OUT AND REALIZED THAT THE SPARK PLUG WAS NO LONGER SCREWED INTO THE HEAD.  THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO THE THREADS ON THE SPARK PLUG.  IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE SPARK PLUG HAD BLOWN-OUT OF THE HEAD.  I DID A GOOGLE SEARCH AND FOUND THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME PROBLEM FOR THE TRITON ENGINE FOR 1998-2002 MODEL YEARS.  I ALSO FOUND THAT FORD IS NOT PAYING FOR ANY REPAIRS.  TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM, THE HEAD AND HEAD GASKET WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED.  I GOT A PRICE QUOTE OF $2954.10 (INCLUDING TAX, PARTS, AND LABOR).

IT SO HAPPEN IT BROKE IN ''PARK'' POSITION. IDENTICAL PROBLEM AS NHTSA RECALL NO. 97V147000 AND 97V171000.  RESULT:  THIS CONDITION WOULD NOT ALLOW A DISENGAGEMENT OF THE TRANSMISSION FROM THE PARK POSITION OR ANY OTHER GEAR POSITION WHEN THE CABLE BREAK ON CERTAIN POSITION. UNINTENDED VEHICLE MOVEMENT COULD OCCUR.  CORRECTIVE ACTION:  FORD CO.

REALLY HAD TO APPLY FORCE TO MOVE LEVER.  AFTER FORD DEALER REPLACED THE BROKEN SHIFTING CABLE ASSEMBLY, I NOTICED THAT CHANGING GEAR POSITION WOULD ONLY REQUIRE VERY LIGHT EFFORT, RELATIVELY EASY AND SMOOTH MOVEMENT OF THE LEVER. I COULD CHANGE THE GEAR POSITION WITH ONLY FINGER MOVEMENT COMPARE WITH  REALLY VERY HARD HAND MOVEMENT BEFORE.  SUGGESTIONS:  I BELIEVE THIS PROBLEM ISSUES WAS RELATED TO PREVIOUS NHTSA RECALL 97V147000 AND 97V17100 AND FORD CO AND ITS DEALERSHIP SHOULD PROVIDE CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE OF CHECKING THIS CABLE ASSEMBLY INTENDED OPERATION: REPLACED/REPAIR ASSEMBLY IF FOUND ANY ABNORMALITY.

I SEARCH THE INTERNET FOR RELATIVE ISSUES REGARDING MY PROBLEM WAS IDENTICAL TO NHSTA RECALL ID # 97V17100 AND 97V14700. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS STILL ON GOING PROBLEM WITH FORD EXPEDITION SINCE 1997 AS INDICATED TO THE RECALL NUMBER DATE. I ASKED FOR THE OLD PART (SHIFTING CABLE ASSEMBLY SO I COULD EVALUATE WHAT WHEN WRONG. I'VE NOTICED THAT STEEL BRAIDED CABLE WAS USED AND IT WAS ENCLOSED IN A VERY STRONG PLASTIC PROTECTION. BUT THE CABLE BREAK INSIDE THE CASING. I ONLY HAVE 55,000 MILES.  I'D ALSO NOTICED THAT I COULD NOW EASILY CHANGED OR SHIFT THE SHIFTING LEVER WITH VERY LIGHT MOVEMENT OF MY HAND UNLIKE WHEN I'D FIRST GOT MY EXPEDITION BACK IN APRIL 2002. I'D REMEMBER THAT MOST OF THE TIME I HAVE TO REALLY PULLED IT HARD JUST TO SHIFT THE LEVER, BACK THEN I THOUGHT THAT WAS NORMAL BUT AFTER THE SHIFTING CABLE WAS REPLACED I COULD CHANGED THE GEAR POSITION WITH JUST MY FINGER AND REALLY VERY LIGHT PRESSURE. SO. MY CONCLUSIVE TO THE ISSUE WAS 1) FORD PERSONNEL DOES NOT PAY ATTENTION ON PROPER INSTALLATION OF THIS SHIFTING CABLE 2) FORD USE INFERIOR OR SUBSTANDARD PART.  THE MOVEMENT OF THE SLEEVE AND THE LOCATION OF THE BRACKET THAT HOLDS THE ASSEMBLY CLOSE TO THE SHIFTING LEVEL WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROBLEM.  I BELIEVED FORD SHOULD LOOK FURTHER ON THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIS SINCE 1997 I STILL HAVE THE OLD PART AND IT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION.  THE NEWLY INSTALLED CABLE SEEMS TO BE DOING ITS PURPOSE BECAUSE WITH JUST A LIGHT PRESSURE I COULD CHANGE THE GEAR POSITION UNLIKE THE ORIGINAL CABLE ASSEMBLY THAT I REALLY HAVE TO PULL HARD AND PUSH HARD TO CHANGE GEAR POSITION.  *JB",

MY PROBLEM IS TWO-FOLD: FIRST, THE GAS GAUGE REGISTERS ON FULL FOR THE FIRST 200 OR SO MILES AND THEN WORKS ITS WAY RELATIVELY QUICKLY TO THE HALF FULL MARK, WHERE IT THERE IS ONLY 3 OR 4 GALLONS OF GAS LEFT IN THE TANK (FORD CLAIMS IT HOLDS 26 GALLONS). SECONDLY, TRYING TO FILL THE TANK WITH GAS, AS YOU WOULD ANY OTHER VEHICLE, IS VERY FRUSTRATING AND TIME CONSUMING. TWO OR MORE VEHICLES WILL FUEL UP AND LEAVE BEFORE I CAN COMPLETE THE TASK. WHEN HAVING AN ESTIMATED 4 GALLONS LEFT IN THE TANK, UPON REFUELING, THE PUMP WILL STOP BETWEEN 11 AND 12 GALLONS, AND ACCEPT ANOTHER 10 TO 12 MORE GALLONS AT 4 TO 6 TENTHS AT A TIME,. BUT GET THIS, THE TANK WILL SHOW FULL WITH ONLY 12 GALLONS IN IT!! THE SELLING/SERVICING DEALER SAYS THIS IS NORMAL. I SAY THAT'S WRONG, AND IT'S UNSAFE. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT'S GOING TO RUN OUT, OR KNOW HOW FAR YOU CAN REALLY GO ON A TANK. (NO IDEA IF THE TANK WAS REALLY FULL) HOW ABOUT THE EXTRA EXPOSURE TO THE GASOLINE FUMES THE EPA IS TRYING TO LIMIT US TO AND KEEP OUT OF THE ENVIRONMENT. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT FUEL GAGES HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME AS WELL AS FUEL TANKS. NOT KNOWING WHEN OR WHERE A VEHICLE (NEW VEHICLE) IS GOING TO RUN OUT OF FUEL IS DANGEROUS FOR NOT ONLY THE DRIVER BUT ALSO OTHER DRIVERS. THE FUEL TANK FILLING PROBLEM IS INEXCUSABLE.

THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT MOVE BACK OR FORWARD.  NO ONE WAS INJURED AS NO CARS WERE BEHIND ME.  AFTER ABOUT 15 MINUTES OF TRYING TO MOVE THE VEHICLE BACK OR FORWARD AND MOVING THE 4X4 KNOB IN THE DASHBOARD, I WAS ABLE TO UNLOCK THE WHEELS AND DRIVE HOMEW WITH THE VEHICLE.  I HAVE NOT DRIVEN THE VEHICLE SINCE THEN UNTIL I CAN GET MORE INFORMATION ON WHETHER THERE IS A SAFETY PROBLEM.  I INTEND TO CALL THE DEALERSHIP TOMORROW TO REPORT THE PROBLEM.  I AM CONCERNED ABOUT DRIVING THE VEHICLE AT A HIGHER RATE OF SPEED BECAUSE IF THE WHEELS LOCKED UP AT A HIGHER RATE OF SPEED IT CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT IF SOMEONE HAPPENS TO BE DRIVING BEHIND.",
