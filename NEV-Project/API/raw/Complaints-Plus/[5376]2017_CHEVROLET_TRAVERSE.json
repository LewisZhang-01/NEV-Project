ON 4/29/20 THE LOW TIRE LIGHT CAME ON AND I DISCOVERED A SCREW WAS IN THE TIRE. I WENT TO DISCOUNT TIRE TO HAVE IT FIXED AND THE GUY THERE NOTICED THAT THE FRONT PASSENGER WAS CRACKING AND SPLITTING FROM THE RIM. HE SAID THOSE SPECIFIC GOODYEAR TIRES ARE TO BE GOOD FOR 65,000 MILES. THE CHEVY TRAVERSE ONLY HAS 36,120 MILES ON IT, 9,000 MORE THAN WHEN WE PURCHASED IT. I NOW HAVE TO PURCHASE FOUR NEW TIRES BECAUSE THE CURRENT ONES ARE BEGINNING TO SPIT AND CRACK WHICH COULD LEAD TO A BLOW OUT. MY WIFE MAINLY DRIVES THE TRAVERSE WITH OUR 2 DAUGHTERS TO AND FROM SCHOOL AND DAYCARE. I WILL PROVIDE A PICTURE WHERE YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE SPLIT BELOW THE RIM.",

IT COULD HAVE BEEN A MAJOR ACCIDENT! I WENT TO ADVANCE AUTO CAUSE I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS MY BATTERY, EVEN THOUGH ITS A BRAND NEW CAR. NO. IT WASN'T THEY TESTED IT AND EVERYTHING. SO I CALLED THE DEALER AND THEY TOOK IT IN FOR A DAY TO THEN TELL ME THAT IT IS SHOWING BATTERY CODES. I HAD JUST CHECKED THE BATTERY THE DAY BEFORE! SO I KNEW IT WASN'T THAT, BUT THEY WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. SO TO PLAY IT SAFE, I BOUGHT A NEW BATTERY. I HAD THE PLACE I BOUGHT THE NEW ONE FROM TEST MY OLD BATTERY AND BIG SHOCKER THE TEST CAME BACK AS A GOOD BATTERY. SO I SPENT THE MONEY FOR A UNNECESSARY BATTERY. A MONTH GOES BY AND NOTHING HAPPENS. THEN ABOUT 2-3 WEEKS AGO MY SCREEN STARTS COMPLAINING ABOUT \"DISK ERROR\" THE DVD SYSTEM ISN'T EVEN ON, AND I'M NOT PLAYING MUSIC ON IT EITHER SO IT SHOULDN'T BE SHOWING ME \"DISK ERROR\" EVEN IF THERE WAS A DISK IN IT.

I WAS WITHOUT A CAR FOR 3 DAYS! THIS COULD HAVE BEEN FATAL HAD I BEEN ON A BUSY ROAD OR EXPRESSWAY. I WILL BE GETTING RID OF THIS CAR ASAP AND DO NOT EVEN FEEL SAFE DRIVING IT TO THE DEALER TO TRADE IT IN! I'VE RECENTLY LEARNED THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM IN GM CARS AND IT'S VERY DANGEROUS!
