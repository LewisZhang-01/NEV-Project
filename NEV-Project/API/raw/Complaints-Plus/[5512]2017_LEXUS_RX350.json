THE SERVICE CONSULTANT WOULD NOT EXPLAIN WHAT THE TSB WAS FIXING OR HOW IT REMEDIED THE PROBLEM. I CONTACTED LEXUS CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY SAID THE  TSB UPGRADED THE METER CONTROL LOGIC UNIT.  ONGOING PROBLEM: IF THE CAR SITS FOR MORE THAN 1 DAY, THE BRAKE PEDAL MUST BE DEPRESSED WITH MUCH FORCE BEFORE THE CAR IS ABLE TO START.  THIS INDICATES THE BRAKE BOOSTER IS STILL LOSING PRESSURE. CONCERN: IF THE BRAKE BOOSTER LOSES PRESSURE WHILE SITTING IN THE GARAGE FOR MORE THAN A DAY, WILL IT FAIL ON THE HIGHWAY WHILE DRIVING.  LOSING BRAKE PRESSURE IS NOT A GOOD THING UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, AND IS TOTALLY UNEXPECTED ON A \"LUXURY\" SUV.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS  LEXUS BRAKE POWER ISSUE.   THANK YOU.",
