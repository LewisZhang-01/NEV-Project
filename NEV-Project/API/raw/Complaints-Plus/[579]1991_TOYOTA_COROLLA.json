I GOT IN MY CAR AND EVEN BEFORE I PUT MY KEY IN THE IGNITION I HEARD A STATIC/CRACKLING SOUND COMING FROM THE REAR SPEAKERS.  IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME RIGHT AWAY THAT THE CAR ENGINE WAS OFF SO I SHOULD NOT HAVE HEARD THE RADIO AT ALL.  AS I STARTED THE CAR I HIT THE RADIO BUTTON THINKING THE RADIO WAS ON BUT HAD LOST THE STATION.  THE NOISE DID NOT GO AWAY WHEN I HIT THE BUTTON AND I REALIZED THE CAR WAS FILLING WITH SMOKE, COMING FROM INSIDE THE UPPER DASH (AREA OF RADIO) IN THE FRONT OF THE CAR.  I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER AND SHUT THE ENGINE OFF AND GOT OUT OF THE CAR.  SMOKE CONTINUED TO COME FROM THE AIR VENTS.  IT SEEMED TO HAVE A ELECTRICAL BURNING SMELL (I'VE WORKED IN LABS AND STARTED A FEW MYSELF...) VERSUS A GAS OR OIL OR OTHER BURNING SMELL.  WHEN THE SMOKE CLEARED, I CHECKED THE REST OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AND THE LIGHTS AND AIR CONDITIONING AND DIGITAL CLOCK WORKED FINE.  THE CAR REALLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY MUCH ELSE I COULD CHECK, NO ELECTRIC DOOR LOCKS, ETC.  I PULLED THE RADIO FUSE.  IT WAS NOT BLOWN.  I STARTED THE CAR WITH FRIENDS WATCHING AND THE ENGINE APPEARED TO BE FINE.  I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE HOME A 5 MILE RIDE WITH NO APPARENT PROBLEM.  THE RADIO/CASSETTE PLAYER WERE INSTALLED WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR.  I USE IT ALL THE TIME AND NEVER HAD PROBLEMS BEFORE.
