        "summary": "I OWN A 2007 ACURA RL WITH THE COLLISION MITIGATION BRAKING SYSTEM.   I WAS INTRODUCED TO THIS FEATURE WITH MY FRIENDS 2006 RL SO I KNOW HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK.  MY 07 DOES NOT FUNCTION THE SAME.  THE SYSTEM DOES NOT ALERT ME OF POTENTIAL ACCIDENTS WITH SUFFICIENT WARNING LIKE THE 06. I EXPERIENCED A NEAR COLLISION IN JULY 07 AND THE SYSTEM NEVER EVEN WENT TO 'STAGE 1', LET ALONE STAGE 2 OR 3. I TESTED IT MYSELF (INTENTIONALLY) SEVERAL MORE TIMES BUT COULD NOT GET THE SYSTEM TO GO TO STAGE 1.  THIS IS THE FIRST STAGE AND SHOULD BE EASY TO REACH.  THEY HAVE CHECKED THE CAR BUT CONCLUDED THERE IS NOTHING WRONG.  I KNOW ONE OTHER PERSON WITH AN 07 AND HE HAS THE SAME COMPLAINT.  I'M AFRAID SOMETHING MAY BE WRONG WITH ALL THE 07'S IF THEIR COMPUTERS DON'T DETECT ANYTHING.  I HAVE GIVEN UP MY PERSONAL ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT I HOPE THE NHTSA CAN FORCE ACURA TO INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE AND DETERMINE IF A RECALL IS NECESSARY.  BY THE WAY, ACURA CORPORATE CONFIRMED FOR ME THEY MADE NO INTENTIONAL CHANGES TO THE SYSTEM BETWEEN 06 AND 07.  A DESCRIPTION OF THIS FEATURE CAN BE FOUND NEAR THE END OF THIS SAFETY PAGE; HTTP://WWW.HONDANEWS.COM/CATEGORIES/755/RELEASES/3766.  *TR",
