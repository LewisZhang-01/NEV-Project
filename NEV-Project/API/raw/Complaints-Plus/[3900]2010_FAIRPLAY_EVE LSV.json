AFTER STOPPING, I LOOK UNDERNEATH AT THE STEERING AND FOUND THAT THE STEERING KNUCKLE? WAS MISSING AND I THOUGHT MAY HAVE BROKEN OFF. A FEW FEET BEHIND THE VEHICLE, I FOUND THE STEERING KNUCKLE AND BOOT PROTECTOR. MY INSPECTION LOOK LIKE THE STEERING KNUCKLE IS INTACT AND JUST CAME LOOSE, FALLING OFF, CAUSING THE STEERING TO FAIL. I DREAD WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED IF I WERE GOING FASTER DOWNHILL ON A CURVE. I LIVE IN THE MOUNTAINS WHERE ALL THE ROADS ARE NARROW WITH CURVES AND A LOT OF UP HILL AND DOWN HILL AREAS. I WILL CLEAN THE KNUCKLE IN THE MORNING AND TRY AND REATTACH IT. HOWEVER, AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE, I DO NOT KNOW IF I CAN TRUST THE VEHICLE ANY MORE.  *TR",
