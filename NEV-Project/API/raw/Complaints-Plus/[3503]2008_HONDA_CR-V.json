        "summary": "This vehicle had a wheel separation while traveling at low speed.  The right rear wheel separated from the car.  The cause is excessive rust to the trailing arm and specifically to the subframe to which the trailing arm is attached.     The car is available for inspection.  I also have photographs that show the problem.   The safety issue is clear. After separation the car cannot be controlled if in motion.   This particular vehicle has not been inspected. The wheel separation was reported by me to Honda in North America, to \"Chris\" in \"client relations.\"  A case number was issued for my complaint, #00499145.  An insurance claim was made, but the insurer denied the claim.     My research shows that this model CRV has been recalled in Canada for this precise problem. In Canada, Honda states that this model CRV has \"excessive\" rust, leading to failure.  Further, that the problem is not readily apparent on inspection, and in fact this car is inspected annually as part of North Carolina licensure, and no inspection ever revealed the excessive rust threat.  Here is the Honda press release:  \"  January 23, 2019 Honda has voluntarily recalled approximately 83,953 2007-2011 CR-V vehicles in Canada to address potential excessive corrosion to the rear frame stiffener(s).  On affected vehicles, one or both rear frame stiffener(s) may become excessively corroded over time. Such excessive corrosion may be more prevalent where a vehicle is regularly operated in regions where road de-icing salt is frequently used during the winter season. Although a certain amount of corrosion is expected to occur from everyday operation of the vehicle, excessive corrosion to the rear frame may result in frame stiffener perforation and, in extreme cases, cause the rear-trailing arm to separate from the vehicle\u2019s frame structure. A separated rear-trailing arm may cause the vehicle to be difficult to control, increasing the risk of a crash.\"",

Since the noise was very abnormal and very loud, I decided not to drive the car. Next, I searched on internet to see if other Honda owners have same issue. I went to https://owners.honda.com/servicemaintenance/recalls?id= website and found the following. HONDA IS RECALLING CERTAIN MODEL YEAR 2005-2010 ACCORD, 2007-2010 CR-V, AND 2005-2008 ELEMENT PASSENGER CARS MANUFACTURED FROM JULY 1, 2004, THROUGH SEPTEMBER 3, 2010.

A BROKEN OUTER RACE MAY CAUSE ABNORMAL NOISE, THE MALFUNCTION INDICATOR LIGHT TO TURN ON, AND ALLOW CONTACT BETWEEN THE TRANSMISSION IDLE GEAR AND AN ELECTRONIC SENSOR HOUSING WITHIN THE TRANSMISSION.  SAFETY RISK: THIS COULD RESULT IN A SHORT CIRCUIT CAUSING THE ENGINE TO STALL. ADDITIONALLY, BROKEN PIECES OF THE OUTER RACE OR BALL BEARING FROM THE SECONDARY SHAFT MAY BECOME LODGED IN THE PARKING PAWL RESULTING IN THE VEHICLE ROLLING AFTER THE DRIVER HAS PLACED THE GEAR SELECTOR IN THE PARK POSITION. ENGINE STALL AND UNEXPECTED VEHICLE MOVEMENT INCREASES THERISK OF A CRASH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO PERSONS WITHIN THE PATH OF AROL LING VEHICLE.  Then I called AutoNation Honda O'Hare dealer in Des Plaines , IL and explained my issue. I was told by the dealership that my VIN number is not covered in spite of me having exactly the same issue as described in HONDA'S RECALL CAMPAIGN NUMBER R89 and that I will have to pay for the diagnosis and repair.  Next I called American Honda corporation and explained my issue. I was told  that my VIN number is not covered in spite of me having exactly the same issue as described in HONDA'S RECALL CAMPAIGN NUMBER R89 and that I will have to pay for the diagnosis.

WHILE DRIVING ON CITY STREETS AND FLUCTUATING BETWEEN 5 TO 20MPH THE DOOR LOCKS WOULD LOCK AND UNLOCK UNTIL YOU GET TO HIGHWAY SPEED. THE REAR DRIVER DOOR WOULD STAY UNLOCKED.  I WENT TO A HONDA DEALER TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT AND THEY SAID THE ACTUATOR WAS BAD AND THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE DOOR LOCK ACTUATOR WAS BEGINNING TO FAIL DUE A LOAD NOISE WHEN ACTIVATED.  THEY REPLACED BOTH ACTUATORS AT A COST OF $602.25.  I HAVE SERVICE RECORDS OF THE VEHICLE FROM THE PAST OWNER AND THE PAST OWNER HAD THE DRIVER SIDE FRONT ACTUATOR REPLACED AND THE REAR ACTUATOR WAS LOOKED AT BUT NOT REPLACED.  I READ THE CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT AND IT SAYS, \"FOR ALL SETTLEMENT CLASS VEHICLES, HONDA WILL PROVIDE A COUNTERMEASURE REPLACEMENT FREE OF CHARGE, IF THAT LOCK DOOR ACTUATOR HAS NOT ALREADY BEEN REPLACED WITH THE COUNTERMEASURE REPLACEMENT PART AS PROVIDED IN THE HONDA CASE 2:13-CV-00381-FSH-JBC   DOCUMENT 56-1   FILED 09/24/14     PAGE 14 OF 72 PAGEID: 694  11  COUNTERMEASURE UPDATE.

THE PREVIOUS OWNER HAD THE CRV SERVICE BEFORE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY ENDED AND THE ACTUATORS DID NOT GET REPLACED.  I CONTACTED HONDA AND THEY ARE WILLING TO GIVE ME A $100.00 VOUCHER TO BE USED AT ANY HONDA DEALERSHIP.

IN BEGINNING OF 2015, AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH HONDA DEALER AND AT THAT TIME ONLY DRIVER SIDE DOOR LOCK WAS COVERED (NOT OTHER THREE DOOR LOCKS). DEALER IS STATING THAT I MUST PAY FOR DIAGONISIS AND REPAIRS. ITEM 3 OF LETTER I RECEIVED FROM HONDA IN 2015 DID NOT SPECIFICALLY STATES: \"IF A DOOR LOCK ACTUATOR ON YOUR CR-V MALFUNCTIONS, YOU MAY BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE DOOR LOCK ACTUATOR REPAIRS UNDER AN EXTENDED WARRENTY WITHOUT CHARGE AT AN AUTHORIZED HONDA DEALER...\" THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN SINCE MY ABILITY TO LOCK THE CAR AT ALL TIMES (WHEN REQUIRED) IS COMPROMISED DUE TO MALFUNCTIONING PARTS INSTALLED IN 2008 HONDA CR-V.",

HOURS AND HOURS OF WORK THAT MY HUSBAND TOOK OFF SO HE COULD DRIVE HALFWAY ACROSS ATLANTA EACH TIME TO DEAL WITH RENTALS AND HONDA.   FINALLY GOT OUR CAR BACK EARLY THIS SUMMER. YESTERDAY I GOT A NEW RECALL NOTICE FROM HONDA. THIS TIME IT'S FOR OUR PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG. BASICALLY THE SAME THING, IF IT DEPLOYS IT MAY KILL YOU WITH METAL FRAGMENTS. THIS TIME WHEN I CALLED HONDA TO FIND OUT THE DEAL I WAS TOLD, \"THE PART IS ON BACKORDER. WE WILL ORDER IT BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHEN WE WILL GET IT. UNTIL WE DO WE SUGGEST THAT YOU AVOID HAVING A PASSENGER SIT IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT.\" SERIOUSLY, THIS IS WHAT THEY SAID.   NOPE THEY WON'T HELP US WITH A RENTAL, JUST DON'T SIT IN THE FRONT BECAUSE IF YOU GET IN A WRECK THE AIRBAG THAT IS SUPPOSED TO KEEP YOU SAFE MAY KILL YOU WITH FLYING METAL FRAGMENTS.   FOR OUR FAMILY OF 4, THIS \"AVOIDING THE PASSENGER SEAT\" IS NOT AN OPTION. WITH 2 BOOSTER SEATS IN THE BACK THERE ISN'T SPACE FOR AN ADULT TO SIT, SO BASICALLY THEY'VE RENDERED OUR MAIN VEHICLE UNUSABLE. BUT REFUSE TO HELP US IN ANY WAY.   I'VE MADE MULTIPLE CALLS TO HONDA HEADQUARTERS AND HAVE \"TICKETS\" IN PLACE TO REQUEST ALTERNATE TRAVEL ASSISTANCE (RENTAL) BUT WAS TOLD THAT THEY ARE, \"PRETTY BACKLOGGED WITH REQUESTS RIGHT NOW SO I DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY WILL GET BACK TO YOU.\"  SERIOUSLY.",

I BEGAN CALLING TWO LOCAL DEALERS WHO SAID THEY DID NOT HAVE THE PARTS, BUT WOULD NOTIFY ME WHEN THEY DO.  MEANWHILE, I HAVE TO KEEP DRIVING THE \"UNSAFE\" VEHICLE.  I CONTINUE TO CALL THEM, THEY DO HAVE MY INFORMATION ON FILE, AND I MAKE THEM VERIFY THAT BY GIVING ME THE VIN NUMBER EACH TIME I CALL SO I KNOW I AM IN THE QUEUE.  MEANWHILE, TODAY I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HONDA SAYING IT IS IMPORTANT THAT I RESPOND. DO I STILL OWN THE VEHICLE? THEY HAVE MY VIN NUMBER. I WOULD HOPE THAT WHEN THE DEALER RECORDS IT IN THE WAITING LIST, THE DATA WOULD BE UPLOADED TO HONDA'S DATABASE. APPARENTLY NOT, THE NUMBER IS ON THE LETTER.  BUT THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE MANY ANNOYANCES.  MY BIGGEST ISSUE IS THAT I HAVE A VEHICLE THAT THEY ARE TELLING ME IS VERY UNSAFE FOR ME OR A PASSENGER, YET THEY EXPECT ME TO CONTINUE USING THIS VEHICLE UNTIL THEY DECIDE TO FIX IT..  I WOULD THINK THEY HAVE HUGE LIABILITY.  IN ADDITION, A FRIEND HAD THE AIRBAGS REPLIED IN HER CIVIC LAST WINTER AT THE SAME DEALER, DIAMOND VALLEY HONDA IN HEMET, CALIFORNIA.  WHAT IS THIS?

I HAVE ALSO CALLED MULTIPLE TIMES TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER AND HAVE BEEN PROMISED ONE WILL CALL ME BACK BY THAT DAY. AFTER OVER A WEEK AND MULTIPLE REQUESTS, STILL NOT ONE HONDA REPRESENTATIVE HAS RETURNED MY CALL. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING AROUND WITH AN UNSAFE CAR FROM HONDA AND THEY HAVE IGNORED MY REPEATED REQUESTS TO HAVE A CASE MANAGER TO HELP ME WITH THIS ISSUE.    ALSO, THEY OFFERED ME A RENTED CAR FOR ONLY UP TO $35.00 A DAY - HOWEVER FOR THAT BUDGET IT IS A SMALL COMPACT CAR THAT CANNOT FIR MY CAR SEATS. I WENT TO THE HONDA DEALER SERVICE MANAGER AND TOLD THEM WITH THAT BUDGET I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET A CAR THAT WILL FIT MY CAR SEATS - HE SAID THAT'S THE BUDGET AND HONDA WILL NOT PAY A PENNY MORE. SO NOW BECAUSE OF THIS HONDA RECALL, I HAVE TO PAY AN EXTRA $10.00 A DAY TILL THEY GET THIS PART - SOMETIME IN SUMMER 2016!!!  NOT ONLY DID HONDA NOT EVEN HAVE THEIR \"CASE MANAGER\" OR MANAGER RETURN A CONCERNED CONSUMERS REQUEST TO TALK TO SOMEONE AFTER LEAVING MULTIPLE MESSAGES, BUT NOW THIS RECALL IS COSTING ME MONEY. I WILL NEVER BUY A CAR FROM HONDA AGAIN, THEY ARE NEGLIGENT AND TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS WITH DISRESPECT.",

I WILL BE CONTACTING THEM SOON IN AN ATTEMPT TO ASK ABOUT THIS ISSUE; HOWEVER, I WANTED TO CONTACT YOU AS I CONSIDER THIS TO BE A SAFETY CONCERN. COULD THIS POTENTIALLY LEAD TO THE AIRBAGS INFLATING BECAUSE OF A LACK OF PADDING?  NO LONGER WILL THE AIRBAGS BE CUSHIONED FROM ANY IMPACTS/BUMPS/WEIGHT-- NOT AS MUCH MATERIAL.

AFTER INVESTIGATION, I SAW THAT THE SMALL SCREW THAT HOLDS THE PLASTIC AND METAL PARTS TOGETHER HAD PULLED THROUGH THE THIN SLIP OF PLASTIC TO WHICH IT WAS ATTACHED.     THE ENGINE APPARENTLY TURNS OFF IF THE KEY FOB IS NOT IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE IGNITION. THIS MECHANISM PRESUMABLY HAS ANTI-THEFT FUNCTIONS, WHILE ALSO PREVENTING ANYONE BUT HONDA FROM SELLING REPLICATE KEYS. IN THIS CASE IT HAD THE WHOLLY UNDESIRED EFFECT OF SHUTTING OFF THE ENGINE OF A CAR IN MOTION. IN ORDER TO RE-START THE CAR, THE PARTS HAD TO BE PRECARIOUSLY JAMMED BACK TOGETHER, AND I WAS FORCED TO DRIVE HOME WITH THE FEAR THAT THEY WOULD AGAIN RE-SEPARATE AND CAUSE THE ENGINE TO TURN OFF.     UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE THE KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION WHEN THE CAR IS IN GEAR, BUT UNDER THIS APPARENTLY UNANTICIPATED FAILURE MODE, IF THE KEY FOB EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN STRUCTURAL FAILURE, THE ENGINE DOES TURN ITSELF OFF.     THIS SITUATION REPRESENTS A SAFETY HAZARD BECAUSE OF THE RISK THAT THE CAR WILL ABRUPTLY LOSE BOTH ENGINE POWER AND POWER STEERING. I WAS IN A PARKING LOT WHEN THIS HAPPENED, BUT IF I HAD BEEN TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEED, OR IN TRAFFIC, THE SITUATION COULD HAVE BEEN VERY DANGEROUS.  IT SEEMS REASONABLE FOR THE KEY FOB TO BE REQUIRED TO START THE ENGINE, BUT ONCE THE ENGINE IS RUNNING, LOSS OF THE SIGNAL FROM THE FOB SHOULD NOT RESULT IN THE ENGINE TURNING OFF.  *TR",

THIS OPINION IS BASED ON THE PROBLEM NOT OCCURRING DURING THE DAY THEY HAD THE CAR. THIS PROBLEM DOES NOT OCCUR EVERY DAY OR EVEN EVERY WEEK. I TOLD THEM THAT THE POWER CONTROL MODULE MAY BE THE PROBLEM BUT THEY REFUSE TO REPLACE IT.    MY CONTACTS TO INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOPS HAVE RESULTED IN BEING TOLD THIS IS A PROBLEM TO BE ADDRESSED BY HONDA AND NOT AN INDEPENDENT SHOP.    I FEEL THAT AN ACCIDENT WILL EVENTUALLY OCCUR AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN FOR HELP.    PLEASE HELP ME RESOLVE THIS DANGEROUS SITUATION.  *TR",

MY PERSONAL SAFETY IS AT RISK IF MY ALARM SYSTEM FAILS TO SECURE ALL DOORS. IT IS UNSETTLING TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCE OF BEING UNEXPECTEDLY TRAPPED INSIDE THE CAR.  IT IS EQUALLY TROUBLESOME TO DRIVE THE CAR NOT KNOWING IF MY CHILDREN AND I MAY BECOME LOCKED OUT IN THE DARK, IN A PARKING DECK, OR IN A REMOTE LOCATION DURING TRAVEL.  REPAIRING EACH LOCK AS IT FAILS IS A RISKY GAMBLE, BUT I CANNOT AFFORD TO REPLACE ACTUATORS (APPROX $250 X 5 DOORS) ON EVERY DOOR AS A PREEMPTIVE REPAIR, EITHER.  *TR",

IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME TWO, THE FRONT PASSENGER DOOR AND THE REAR DOOR.  I WOULD PUSH THE UNLOCK BUTTON ON MY KEY, AND THE OTHER 3 DOORS WOULD UNLOCK, BUT THOSE 2 WOULD NOT.  I TRIED USING THE UNLOCK/LOCK BUTTONS ON THE DRIVER'S DOOR, AND AFTER HITTING THE LOCK BUTTON FIRST AND THEN UNLOCK SEVERAL TIMES, IT WOULD WORK AND THOSE 2 DOORS WOULD EVENTUALLY UNLOCK.  AND THEN SOMETIMES ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY WOULD START UNLOCKING AGAIN USING THE KEY.  THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING ANNOYANCE FOR THE PAST 2-3 YEARS.  I CAN'T REMEMBER THE EXACT DATE OR MILEAGE WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENED.  PROBABLY ABOUT A YEAR AGO, THEY FINALLY STOPPED COMPLETELY.  THEY WILL NOT UNLOCK AT ALL USING THE KEY OR THE DRIVER'S DOOR.  THE PASSENGER ONE, OF COURSE, I CAN MANUALLY UNLOCK FROM THE INSIDE IF NEEDED.  BUT THE REAR I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO WAY OF OPENING THAT DOOR.  COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS!!!  IT HAS BEEN A COMPLETE PAIN TO NOT HAVE THAT STORAGE AREA.  I HAVE HAD TO LOWER THE BACK SEATS TO PUT ANYTHING IN THERE.  IT ALSO CAUSED ME TO INCUR DAMAGE TO MY CAR THIS YEAR.  I HAD A FLAT AND NEEDED THE SPARE TIRE.  WELL, I HAD TO CLIMB THROUGH THE DOORS INTO THE BACK WHERE MY SPARE WAS, ONLY TO REALIZE YOU COULDN'T GET TO THE SPARE BECAUSE THE REAR DOOR WAS IN THE WAY.  SO I HAD TO RIP THE BACK FLAP TO GET TO THE TIRE.  SO THAT WILL COST ME MONEY TO FIX.  THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE DEALER TELLING ME EACH ACTUATOR WILL COST OVER $300 TO GET REPLACED.  AFTER RESEARCHING TRYING TO FIND THIS ACTUATOR PART, I CAME ACROSS THE LAWSUIT AND MANY MANY OTHERS WITH THIS PROBLEM.

AS I WAS DRIVING, THE LOCKS WOULD AUTOMATICALLY UNLOCK AND LOCK THEMSELVES EVERY TIME I CAME TO A STOP AND STARTED DRIVING AGAIN. THE PROBLEM STOPPED AFTER A FEW DAYS, THEN A FEW WEEKS LATER, STARTED OCCURRING AGAIN. BEFORE I CALLED TO HAVE IT CHECKED, IT STOPPED, BUT THEN I WOULD HEAR A SQUEALING SOUND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE DOORS WERE LOCKED UPON ACCELERATION. ALL OF THESE ISSUES STOPPED, BUT THEN ABOUT A WEEK AGO (JULY 2013), BOTH DOORS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE STARTED RELOCKING THEMSELVES WITHIN 3 SECONDS OF BEING UNLOCKED BY EITHER THE KEY FOB OR FROM THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR. THEY CANNOT BE LOCKED OR UNLOCKED MANUALLY, EVEN WITH AUTO LOCK OFF. THEY ALSO CANNOT BE OPENED FROM THE INSIDE BY THE PASSENGER. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE FOR MY CHILD, WHO WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OPEN HIS DOOR AND EXIT IMMEDIATELY IN THE CASE OF AN EMERGENCY.    IN ADDITION TO THIS PROBLEM, THE TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM (TPMS) LIGHT IS ON PERMANENTLY ON MY DASHBOARD. ACCORDING TO THE DEALER TECHNICIAN I SPOKE WITH, THIS MEANS THE TPMS HAS STOPPED COMMUNICATING WITH THE SENSORS ON AT LEAST ONE OF MY TIRES. THIS IS A HAZARD IN THAT I COULD HAVE DANGEROUSLY LOW TIRE PRESSURE AND WOULD NOT KNOW IT, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A BLOW OUT AT HIGH FREEWAY SPEEDS. THIS SAME TECHNICIAN REPORTED HE HAS SEEN \"QUITE A FEW\" 2007 AND 2008 CRVS COMING IN WITH THIS ISSUE. I CAN WORK AROUND THIS ISSUE BY FREQUENTLY CHECKING TIRE PRESSURE MYSELF, BUT IT REMAINS THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THIS, WHEN I PAID FOR A VEHICLE THAT SHOULD BE DOING IT FOR ME. *TR",

APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS AGO, THE DOOR LOCKS BEGAN TO MALFUNCTION AND CONTINUOUSLY LOCK AND UNLOCK THEMSELVES WHENEVER THE CAR REACHED 9 OR 10 MILES PER HOUR.  WHEN THE CAR REACHES THIS SPEED WHILE EITHER ACCELERATING OR SLOWING DOWN, THE LOCKS EITHER LOCK THEMSELVES OR UNLOCK THEMSELVES DEPENDING ON THEIR PREVIOUS POSITION.  I DRIVE IN LOS ANGELES TRAFFIC, SO THIS IS A CONSTANT PROBLEM AND I CANNOT AFFORD TO FIX IT AT $200+  PER DOOR.  THESE AUTOMATIC LOCKS (PARTICULARLY THE REAR SEAT ONES) ARE SUPPOSED TO FUNCTION TO PREVENT A CHILD OR OTHER PASSENGER FROM ACCIDENTALLY OPENING A DOOR WHEN THE CAR IS IN MOTION.  THEY ARE ALSO SUPPOSED TO FUNCTION TO KEEP AN INTRUDER FROM BEING ABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR FROM OUTSIDE THE CAR WHILE THE CAR IS TEMPORARILY STOPPED.  THIS IS A TERRIBLE SAFETY HAZARD FOR ALL CHILDREN RIDING IN THE REAR SEAT OF THE CAR, BUT IT COULD ALSO BE DANGEROUS FOR ADULTS WHO MIGHT GRAB THE HANDLE TO STABILIZE THEMSELVES AROUND TURNS.  IF THEY WERE TO ACCIDENTALLY HANG ON TO THE DOOR HANDLE, IT COULD OPEN THE DOOR WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION.  IT IS APPARENTLY A RECURRING PROBLEM ON THE 2006, 2007 AND 2008 MODELS OF THE CR-V ACCORDING TO THE HONDA FORUM ON EDMUNDS.COM.

I JUST BOUGHT IT CERTIFIED 2.5 MONTHS AGO FROM A HONDA DEALERSHIP. I HAVE ALL THE PAPERWORK BUT NO WARRANTY. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. I'M A MECHANICAL ENGINEER, WORKING AS A SYSTEM SAFETY ENGINEER FOR A MAJOR AEROSPACE COMPANY.

I'M WRITING BECAUSE THE ONLY AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY WERE THE PASSENGER WINDOW BAGS (FRONT AND REAR) AND THE STEERING WHEEL AIRBAG. THE \"SENSORS\" SHOULD HAVE SIGNALED THE \"DRIVER SIDE\" BAGS TO DEPLOY. SHE SUFFERED A SEVERE CONCUSSION AND WE CANNOT DETERMINE WHAT PART(S) OF THE VEHICLE HER HEAD STRUCK. THE IMPACT WAS SEVERE ENOUGH TO \"BREAK\" THE SEAT BELT MECHANISM (IT WILL NOT RETREAT BACK).     THE DRIVER SIDE APPEARS TO HAVE TAKEN THE HARDEST HIT FROM THE IMPACT. THUS, IT'S EXTREMELY DISCONCERTING TO ME THAT THE \"DRIVER SIDE AIR BAGS\" DID NOT DEPLOY.

THE VEHICLE CONTINUED TO MOVE ABOUT 50 FEET BEFORE STRIKING A TREE.   IT NEVER SLOWED DOWN, NO MATTER HOW HARD I PRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL.  THE VEHICLE IS EQUIPPED WITH ALL WHEEL DRIVE (AWD).  IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE AWD TOOK OVER AND CONTINUED TO TRY TO GET THE VEHICLE UNDER CONTROL FROM THE SLIDE ON THE ICE.    I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 20 TO 25 MPH AT THE TIME WHEN I STARTED TO SLIDE ON ICE. THE  PASSENGER SIDE WHEELS WENT INTO THE DITCH LINE, WHICH WAS ABOUT 12 INCHES DEEP.  I STEPPED ON THE BRAKES IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WHEELS HIT THE DITCH THINKING IT WOULD SLOW THE VEHICLE SINCE THE WHEELS WERE NO LONGER ON THE ICY ROAD.  AS I SAID EARLIER, AT THAT POINT I WAS PRESSING THE BRAKES AS HARD AS I COULD BUT THE VEHICLE DID NOT SLOW DOWN.  I SUSPECT THERE IS A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE BRAKING SYSTEM AND THE AWD WHEN THIS SITUATION OCCURS.  IT APPEARS THE AWD SOFTWARE CONTINUES TO GAIN STABILITY, AND PREVENTS THE BRAKES FROM STOPPING THE WHEELS.  I ALSO READ A NOTICE FROM HONDA THAT SAYS WHEN A SITUATION LIKE THIS OCCURS THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES ARE DISABLED AND REGULAR BRAKING TAKES OVER. *TR",

NOTHING WRONG WITH THE TIRES, BUT THEY PUT AIR IN THEM.  I HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITHOUT FAIL ABOUT 6 TIMES IN ADDITION TO MY REGULAR MAINTENANCE APPOINTMENTS. I HAVE HAD MY SERVICES AT EACH SERVICE INDICATOR AND PERFORMED ALL OF THE INDICATED CODES. TIRE ROTATIONS AT EACH SERVICE BY A HONDA DEALER. AT MY SECOND SERVICE ON 1/30/09, 16,000MILES MY TIRES WERE MARKED AS 6/32 WEAR TREAD REMAINING. AT MY THIRD AND MOST RECENT SERVICE 9/5/09 THE TIRES WERE MARKED AS 4/32 REMAINING, AND I WAS ADVISED THAT I WOULD NEED TO BUY NEW TIRES AT LESS, THIS IS WITH 26,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE. I CONTACTED BRIDGSTONE/FIRESTONE REGARDING THE SHORT LIFE OF THE TIRES AND THEY SAID THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM, BUT THAT IT IS HONDA THAT IS BUYING POORLY MADE  \"CHEAP\" TIRES AND PUTTING THEM ON THEIR NEW VEHICLES BECAUSE THEY DO NOT WARRANTY THEM FOR MILEAGE. THEN HONDA MAKES OUT LIKE BANDITS FOR SELLING YOU NEW TIRES IN 18,000 TO 32,000 MILES WITH AN ADDED COST FOR MOUNTING AND 4-WHEEL ALIGNMENT AT JUST ABOUT $800.00. THE HONDA SERVICE TECH SEEMED TO GET SOME HUMOR IN TELLING ME THAT I NEEDED NEW TIRES AT 26,000 MILES AND WAS VERY ACCOMMODATING AS FAR AS PROVIDING ME A PRICE FOR THE SAME EXACT PIECES OF CRAP THAT CAME WITH THE VEHICLE, PLUS MOUNTING AND BALANCING FEE, PLUS A 4 WHEEL ALIGNMENT FEE. IF I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THIS BEFORE I BOUGHT MY VEHICLE I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT FROM HONDA. I TOO WAS LOOKING FOR A VEHICLE THAT WAS GOOD IN THE SNOW WE SEE IN NEW ENGLAND WINTERS AND HAD GOOD GAS MILEAGE. WHAT A SCAM HONDA HAS GOING! *TR",

THE TIRES BEGAN TO MAKE A VERY LOUD NOISE AND THE VEHICLE  DEVELOPED A SLIGHT BOUNCING RIDE AT ABOUT 22,000 MILES AND BOTH ISSUES BECAME INTOLERABLE AT ABOUT 26,000 MILES, AND YOU COULD FEEL THE EXTREME CUPPING OF THE TIRES WHEN RUBBING YOUR HAND OVER THE TREAD.  I HAD THE DEALER ROTATE THE TIRES WITH EVERY SCHEDULED OIL CHANGE, AND THE CUPPING PROBLEM STILL CONTINUED TO OCCUR.  THE VEHICLE CAME WITH THE CONTI 4 X 4 TIRES, AND THEY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AT MY EXPENSE WELL BEFORE A REASONABLE LIFE EXPECTANCY.  THE HONDA DEALER WOULD NOT PROVIDE ME WITH ANY WARRANTY ASSISTANCE OR DISCOUNT, STATING THAT THEY WOULD DO A 4 WHEEL ALIGNMENT ON THE VEHICLE - AT MY EXPENSE - AND SELL ME 4 NEW TIRES. THERE ARE NUMEROUS FORUMS ON THE INTERNET WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING AND ALLEGING THAT THE AWD VEHICLES (FWD'S ARE OK) ARE LEAVING THE FACTORY WITH IMPROPER ALIGNMENT OF THE REAR CAMBER AND IT IS CAUSING THE PREMATURE WEAR OF THE FACTORY TIRES.  THE DEALER CLAIMED THAT THEY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THIS PROBLEM. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A NATIONAL TIRE SHOP AND PURCHASED 4 NEW TIRES AND HAD THEM PERFORM A 4 WHEEL ALIGNMENT ON THE VEHICLE....THE COMPUTER READ-OUT THAT THEY PROVIDED ME SHOWED THAT THE REAR TIRES WERE ALIGNED IN EXTREME OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.  THE EMPLOYEES AT THE TIRE SHOP ALLEGED THAT THEY WERE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY SEE LOTS OF 2007 AND 2008 HONDA CRV'S IN THEIR SHOP WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  I BELIEVE THERE IS A PROBLEM FOR WHICH HONDA DOESN'T WANT TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY. TIRE CUPPING IS NOT ONLY A NUISANCE BECAUSE OF THE RUMBLING NOISE THAT GETS LOUDER AT FREEWAY SPEEDS - IT IS ALSO A SAFETY ISSUE FOR BRAKING AND TRACTION BECAUSE OF HOW IT AFFECTS THE AMOUNT OF TREAD SURFACE CONTACT WITH THE ROADWAY. IMMEDIATELY UPON LEAVING THE TIRE SHOP, THE PROBLEM DISAPPEARED AND THE VEHICLE RIDE IS QUIET AND GREAT.  I COST ME OVER $800 FOR NEW TIRES AND A 4 WHEEL ALIGNMENT. *TR",

WHILE AT THIS SHOP, OUR MECHANIC PULLED ALL FOUR WHEELS, AND INFORMED US THAT ALL THE WHEELS STUDS, 20 IN TOTAL, WERE BENT OUTWARD, IN A CIRCUMFERENTIAL PATTERN.  WE WERE THEN ADVISED TO CONTACT AMERICAN HONDA, AS THIS WAS CERTAINLY DUE TO SOME TYPE OF PRODUCT DEFECT.     DUE TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION WE HAD, AT OUR EXPENSE,  THE CRV TOWED TO LEHIGH VALLEY HONDA FOR INSPECTION, AND WE ASSUMED, A WARRANTY REPAIR.

HE THEN DETERMINED THAT SINCE HE HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH DAMAGE, IT MUST HAVE BEEN OUR MISUSE OF THE CRV THAT CAUSED THE DAMAGE AND THUS WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE HONDA WARRANTY.  I SHOULD POINT OUT AT THIS POINT, THAT THE INSPECTION WAS THOROUGH ENOUGH TO OBSERVE THAT THERE WERE THREE BROKEN STUDS, & FIFTEEN DAMAGED ONES. REFER TO ATTACHED  REPORT.

MY LOCAL MECHANIC SUGGESTS THAT EITHER THE WHEELS ARE DEFECTIVE, OR PERHAPS THE TIRES.  HE HAS, AGAIN AT MY EXPENSE, REPLACED ALL 20 WHEEL STUDS AND BEARINGS WITH GENUINE HONDA PARTS.  HE HAS INFORMED ME THAT WE MUST BRING IT IN AT 1,000, 3,000, 6,0000 ETC.
