SHE WENT ON AND ON ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT WHAT I WAS CALLING ABOUT. SHE THEN DEVULGED SOME INTERESTING ISSUES REGARDING MY VEHICLE. FIRST SHE SAID THERE WAS A RECALL. ON MY VEHICLE.I BELIEVE SHE SAID 944, WHICH SHE SAID WAS  A RUST ISSUE RECALL ON THE UNDERCARRIGE. SHE THEN WENT ON TO SAY THE PASSENGER SIDE SAFETY was an issue and complaints  from other accent owners of airbag light SHE THEN SAID OH I BET THATS WHY YOU AIRBAG LIGHT IS ON . SHE DID ALSO SPkEAK OF MY CAR HAVING SOME SORT OF EXTENDED FACTORY WARRANTY., CALLING IT EITHER A TXX OR POSSIBLY PXX WHATEVER THAT MEANS. I HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF  RESEARCH ON THIS ONLY TO FIND OUT THERE ARE MANY HYUNDAI ACCENTS THAT HAVE HAD airbag IREPAIRED FOR FREE. I WAS NOT TOLD THAT MINE WOULD ALSO BE FIXED FREE OF CHARGE. DUE TO MY PERSISTENCE THEY EXPEDIATED MY COMPLAINT TO A CASE MANAGER WHOM I SHOULD HEAR FROM IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. MY CASE NUMBER IS 18924458. WHY HAS THERE NOT BEEN A RECALL ON THIS? IT OBVIOUSLY IS A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT AND HAS OCCURRED IN MANY ACCENTS. What should I do until I hear from case manager? What happens if I disagree with the case workers decision? I do have receipts for close to $ 2,000 worth of routine maintence and repairs which I will upload to you depending on the findings of the case manager.",

SOME VIBRATION AND SHUDDER WHILE DECELERATING AT SPEED AND AROUND 20 MPH.  TOOK THE CAR TO HYUNDAI AROUND SEPTEMBER 2011.  THEY CLAIMED THE CAR HAD 4 MOTOR MOUNTS (ENGINE AND TRANS I ASSUME) AND THAT 2 OF THE MOUNTS WERE BAD. AT DIFFERENT TIMES THEY DESCRIBED THE MOUNTS AS \"BROKEN\", \"CRACKED\", AND \"STRETCHED\".  THEY INSTALLED THE TWO MOUNTS (LOWER FRONT AND BACK LOCATION TO ME) CALLING THEM \"REVISED\". I ASKED TO SEE THE BAD MOUNTS BUT THEY DID NOT SHOW THEM TO ME. THE REPAIR REDUCED THE SIDE VIBRATION BY ABOUT 90% BUT THE VIBRATION WAS STILL THERE. THE STEERING WHEEL VIBRATION IS UNCHANGED. I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER AND ALSO TO . BOTH SERVICE MANAGERS AND TECHNICIANS SAID THE REMAINING VIBRATION IS \"NORMAL\" (THEIR WORDS) BUT THEY PUT DOWN ON THE REPAIR SHEET THAT THE VIBRATION WAS GONE WHICH WAS NOT TRUE. I TOLD THEM THE VIBRATION IS NOT NORMAL ESPECIALLY FOR A BRAND NEW CAR THAT COSTS OVER $12,000.  THEY SAID ALL HYUNDAI 4 CYLINDERS HAVE THE SAME VIBRATION. THE VIBRATION REMAINS. I HAVE READ ONLINE TWO HYUNDAI TECHNICIANS WHO CLAIM THE VIBRATION COULD BE CAUSED BY DEFECTIVE UPPER ENGINE MOUNT, LOOSE TIMING CHAIN OR BELT, DEFECTIVE HARMONIC BALANCER. I HAVE SEEN THIS WEEK A VIDEO ON THE HYUNDAI SONATA AND ITS VIBRATION; MY CAR MAKES THE SAME VIBRATION AND NOISE, ALMOST LIKE ONE OF THE PLUGS IS MISSING. (I HAD AN ENGINE DIAGNOSIS AND IT SAID ALL ELECTRICAL IS OK; NO CHECK ENGINE CODES ARE SHOWING). I HAVE ALSO READ ABOUT THE SEPTEMBER 26 RECALL OF THE HYUNDAI SONATA FOR VIBRATION PROBLEMS. I THINK THE 2010 HYUNDAI SHOULD ALSO FACE RECALL SINCE THE DEALER HAS ADMITTED THE VIBRATION.  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)  *TT",

THIS ALSO HAPPENS WHEN IT RAIN AND ROADS ARE REALLY WET. ON 6/14/10 I TOOK MY CAR IN FOR ANOTHER MANUFACTURE DEFECT AND DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES AND WAS TOLD THAT'S NORMAL. ON 1/23/2011 MY DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING DOWN MAYFIELD RD DOWN THE BIG HILL AND GOT A SPEEDING TICKET GOING 68 MILES PER HR. IN A 45 MILE ZONE. SHE SAID WHEN SHE NOTICED THE CAR WAS GOING 50 TO 55 SHE TRIED TO SLOW DOWN AND THE BRAKES WOULDN'T WORK UNTIL SHE GOT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL. THERE WASN'T ANY SNOW ON THE ROAD BUT IT WAS WET AND SALTED AND 0 OUTSIDE. SHE NO LONGER DRIVES THE CAR WHEN IT SNOWS OR RAINS OR WHEN THE ROADS ARE WET, AND THIS IS HER CAR. A FEW DAYS LATER MY SON BORROWED THE CAR FOR WORK AND WHEN HE BROUGHT IT BACK HE SAID HE WAS ALMOST IN A ACCIDENT BECAUSE THE BRAKES WOULDN'T STOP THE CAR. HE DESCRIBED IT AS THUDDING LIKE THE BRAKES WERE TRYING TO CATCH BUT COULDN'T AND STEERING WHEEL SHAKES, THE CAR WENT ABOUT 12 FEET BEFORE IT STOPPED AND 2 INCHES FROM HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF HIM. I TOOK THE CAR OVER TO A FRIEND WHO DROVE IT AND HE SAID THIS IS NOT NORMAL TAKE IT IN. I CALLED RICK CASE ON 1/31/11 AND TOOK IT IN ON 2/4/11 TO CHECK THE BRAKES AND REPLACE THE INSIDE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR PANEL THAT SNAPPED OFF. RICK CASE DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE BRAKES BUT, ROTATED THE TIRES BECAUSE THE FRONT TIRES TRED LOW AND THIS COULD BE THE PROBLEM. AT THIS TIME THERE IS 10,375 MILES ON THE CAR. 2/18/11 TOOK TO PUT NEW PANEL ON AND TOLD THEM STILL HAVING SAME PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES BUT NOW BRAKING YOU SOMETIME HERE A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL.
