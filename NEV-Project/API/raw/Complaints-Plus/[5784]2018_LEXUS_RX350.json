The vehicle can be inspected; however, a Lexus dealership replaced the sunroof glass without charge, the next day after the incident.  The unexpected loud explosion with flying glass startled my husband while he was driving.  Fortunately, there were no cars around him at the time, because the fright caused by the explosion could have caused a multi-vehicle accident.  A Lexus dealer inspected the sunroof damage, and though they would not acknowledge this was a manufacturer defect, they did replace the glass without charge, stating it was a \"one-time goodwill gesture.\"  The day before the repair, the damage was inspected by Senior Officer Sampson of the Maryland Transportation Authority (phone number 410-537-1197) on December 13, 2021 (not long after the incident).  There were no warnings or symptoms of any kind that would have alerted the driver to the spontaneous explosion.",
