He got it looked at and was told he probably needed lower control arm and links to take care of the problem. After ordering parts, the vehicle, while driving to work, a loud popping sound was heard and then the vehicle dropped down and had to be towed home (thank God this didn't happen on the expressway). I then looked up any recalls on this vehicle and low and behold there was a recall on this year, make and model car BUT not on this VIN number (Ford's number for this recall is 14S02. Recall date 2014-04-02   Recall no.14V165000). This vehicle suddenly and dangerously broke down from this same  problem, and has the same issue that was recalled by Ford on this make, model and year described in their recall (14S02) but the VIN number seems to say otherwise when I looked it up. This needs to be investgated before this happens to someone while driving in snow or rainy condtions or while driving on the expressway. Please investigate!",

THEY SIMPLY BOLTED A CROSS BRACE FROM ONE SIDE OF THE FRAME TO THE OTHER AND IT DOES NOTHING WHEN THE SUBFRAME ACTUALLY CORRODES AWAY.

AFTER TOWING THE ESCAPE TO MY MECHANIC, HE IDENTIFIED THAT THE ACCELERATION CABLE WAS BINDING AGAINST THE ENGINE COVER. AFTER FURTHER IDENTIFYING A RECALL RELATED TO THIS (NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER:12V-353), THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO MY FORD SERVICE CENTER, WHO PERFORMED THE MODIFICATION.    UPON PICKING UP THE CAR AFTER REPAIR AND LEAVING THE LOT OF THE FORD SERVICE CENTER, I IMMEDIATELY EXPERIENCED UNCONTROLLED ACCELERATION A SECOND TIME. QUICKLY HITTING THE BREAKS AND PERFORMING A U-TURN BACK INTO THE FORD LOT, I AGAIN TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND COASTED TO THE GARAGE AREA.  THIS TIME I WAS ON A MULTI-LANE ROAD IN A HIGH TRAFFIC AREA DURING 5:00 TRAFFIC AND SUFFERED NEAR COLLISION WITH MULTIPLE OTHER CARS.    UPON INVESTIGATING THE CAUSE WITH THE SERVICE PERSONNEL, WE OBSERVED THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE HAD COME LOOSE AND BOUND WITH THE ACCELERATION CABLE, RESULTING IN THE UNINTENDED ACCELERATION. ON MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO RECONNECT THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE, IT BECAME APPARENT THAT IT WOULD EASILY COME LOOSE AND BIND AGAIN WITH THE ACCELERATION CABLE. THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE WAS DISCONNECTED AND FIXED INTO LOCATION AWAY FROM THE ACCELERATION CABLE. THE DEALER DID NOT KNOW OR RECOMMEND ANY OTHER METHOD TO FIX THE PROBLEM.    MY OBSERVATION IS THAT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT WEAR ON THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE CONNECTION, POSSIBLY AS A RESULT OF THE INTERFERENCE CONDITION WITH THE THROTTLE COVER.

I UNDERSTAND THAT THE BRACKET IS PART OF THE RECALL. I PICKED THE CAR UP ON JULY 14 2014 AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS SAFE AND NOT TO WORRY ABOUT THE RUST. WE SUBSEQUENTLY SPENT OVER $1,500 MAKING OTHER REPAIRS TO THE CAR, BELIEVING IT WAS A GOOD INVESTMENT.

WHEN IT WAS RECEIVED TO THE BODY SHOP ON MONDAY MORNING THE BRAKES WERE VERY SOFT ACCORDING TO THE TECHNICIAN.  AFTER SITTING FOR A WEEK, THE BRAKES WORKED FINE.  THEY CANT DETERMINE WHY THE BRAKES FAILED.  THE DEALERSHIP WAS THE FIRST CALL I MADE AT THE ACCIDENT AND THEY TOLD ME THEY KNOW IT HAD LEGAL BRAKES.  COME TO FIND OUT THE BRAKE FLUID WAS BLACK AND HAS AN OUTSTANDING RECALL WITH THE ABS THAT HAD NEVER BEEN TAKEN CARE OF.  THERE IS ALSO A RECALL ON CERTAIN MASTER CYLINDERS WHICH WERE FAULTY/LEAKING AND THE STOCK NUMBERS.  UNFORTUNATELY THE STOCK NUMBER WAS REMOVED FROM THE MASTER CYLINDER.  WE HAVE A VEHICLE THAT NEVER EVEN MADE IT TO OUR HOME THAT IS NOW TOTALED.  THE DEALERSHIP IS ONLY GOING TO \"MAKE IT RIGHT\" WITH PROOF THAT THE BRAKES FAILED.  THE POLICE REPORT STATES SUCH AND I HAVE THE REPORT FROM THE BODYSHOP, BUT AFTER WAITING FOR THE INSURANCE TO HAVE THE TEST DONE, THEY CANT CONFIRM LOSS OF BRAKES.  THEY CAN ONLY STATE THE FLUID BEING BLACK.  WE NOW ARE HAVING TO FIGHT TO NOT LOSE OUR TRADE IN VALUE AND TO NOT HAVE A REPORTABLE ACCIDENT AGAINST MY DAUGHTER VS A MECHANICAL FAILURE.  THIS IS A NIGHTMARE BOTH THE DEALERSHIP AND THE INSURANCE ARE NOT MAKING THIS EASY.  THE MOST EXPENSIVE VEHICLE I EVER OWNED FOR 30 MINUTES IS ALL I CAN SAY.  *TR",

WE HAVE EXPERIENCED THROTTLE STICKING WITH THE VEHICLE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE CRUISE CONTROL RECALL.  AFTER RECEIVING A FRANTIC CALL FROM HER THIS EVENING THAT THE THROTTLE HAD STUCK WHILE TRAVELING 70 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY, I HAVE GROWN SICK OF REMAINING SILENT.    THERE IS ANOTHER LARGE PROBLEM THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL RECALL DOES NOT ADDRESS.  IN COLD TEMPERATURES, THE THROTTLE CAN FREEZE DUE TO INTRODUCTION OF HUMID AIR FROM THE PCV (POSITIVE CRANKCASE VENTILATION) SYSTEM.  THE HUMID AIR COMBINES WITH THE SUB-FREEZING FRESH AIR TO FREEZE ON THE THROTTLE VALVE AND RENDER THE GAS PEDAL USELESS.    WHILE I OWNED THE ESCAPE FROM 2007-2011, I EXPERIENCED THE FROZEN THROTTLE SEVERAL TIMES.  AFTER THE DEALERSHIP WAS UNABLE TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM, I GREW FRUSTRATED KNOWING THAT THE VEHICLE WAS UNSAFE BUT WAS MORALLY WITHHELD FROM SELLING THE VEHICLE TO AN UNSUSPECTING CUSTOMER.  I BEGAN TO INVESTIGATE THE ISSUE AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH CAUSED IT.  THIS WAS WHEN I DISCOVERED THE PCV ISSUE.  I CREATED A FIX FOR THE SYSTEM AND SAW ALL THROTTLE STICKING/FREEZING ISSUES GO AWAY.  AFTER DRIVING THE VEHICLE FOR TWO YEARS WITH NO ISSUES, I FELT COMFORTABLE SELLING THE VEHICLE TO MY MOTHER-IN-LAW.    HOWEVER, WHEN SHE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP THIS SUMMER FOR THE CRUISE CONTROL RECALL, THE DEALERSHIP REMOVED THE PCV FIX I HAD IN PLACE.  I WAS UNAWARE OF THIS UNTIL TONIGHT WHEN I RECEIVED HER FRANTIC CALL THAT THE THROTTLE WAS STUCK (IT IS 15 DEG F HERE).  UPON INSPECTING THE VEHICLE, I SAW THAT THE PCV SYSTEM HAD BEEN RESTORED TO THE ORIGINAL FAULTY CONFIGURATION BY THE DEALERSHIP WHICH CREATED THE FREEZING CONDITIONS AGAIN.    DISASTER WAS AVOIDED TONIGHT, BUT I DON'T WANT IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN.  *TR",

THE FLOORMATS WERE NOT THE PROBLEM.... I PULLED OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, WITH MY ONE YEAR OLD BABY IN THE BACK SEAT.  I THEN TURNED THE ESCAPE OFF, AND RESTARTED IT, THE ENGINE SOUNDED AS IF IT WERE GOING TO BLOW, IT WAS REVVING UP TO 4 AND 5 GRAND.  I THEN CALLED A MECHANIC I KNEW, HE CAME TO GET MY VEHICLE TO DRIVE IT BACK TO HIS SHOP.  DURING HIS VERY VERY SHORT DRIVE, HE NEVER HAD TO PUT HIS FOOT ON THE GAS AT ALL, AND THE VEHICLE DROVE 40 MILES PER HOUR BY ITSELF... SO FAR, ALL WE KNOW IS THAT THE IAC VALVE HAD WENT BAD...(IDLE AIR CONTROL)....I HAVE HAD IT BACK A FEW DAYS AND NOT HAD ANY MORE PROBLEMS AT THIS TIME, ALTHOUGH I AM VERY CAREFUL AND SCARED THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.... DURING RESEARCH, I FOUND THEIR WERE ALMOST 500,000 2003 MODEL FORD ESCAPES RECALLED FOR SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THE ACCELERATION.

ON OCTOBER 24, 2007 I TOOK IT TO MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP, NAPLETON'S NORTHWESTERN FORD IN CHICAGO, FOR AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE ZONE DISTRICT MANAGER.  HE DECLINED MY REQUEST FOR FINANCIAL HELP IN REPAIRING THIS PROBLEM, CITING THAT THE WARRANTY PERIOD HAD EXPIRED. MY ESTIMATE FOR REPAIR FROM NAPLETON'S RECOMMENDED BODY SHOP SAID, IN WRITING, THAT THE PEELING PAINT WAS CAUSED BY DELAMINATION OF PAINT AND A BAD PRIMING PREP JOB. I SENT A COPY OF THE ESTIMATE, PICTURES OF THE DAMAGE AND A LETTER OF EXPLANATION TO BOTH THE FORD CUSTOMER RELATIONS CENTER IN DETROIT AND MY DEALERSHIP OWNER - AND RECEIVED BACK A SHORT FORM LETTER FROM DETROIT STATING THAT THEY WOULD NOT HELP ME FINANCIALLY AS THE WARRANTY PERIOD HAD EXPIRED.  ALTHOUGH I REALIZE THAT THE WARRANTY PERIOD HAS EXPIRED, I BELIEVE THAT MY PAINT PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY SUBSTANDARD WORK AT THE FACTORY, A BELIEF SUBSTANTIATED BY THE BODY SHOP.  RECALLS ARE DONE ALL THE TIME FOR PARTS THAT ARE FAULTY, REGARDLESS OF WARRANTY.  MY PAINT JOB WAS FAULTY, AND THEREFORE I BELIEVE FORD SHOULD HELP ME FIX IT.  ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR AUTO SAFETY AND OTHER WEB SITES, PAINT SHOULD NOT BE PEELING OFF CARS THAT ARE ONLY 4 OR 5 YEARS OLD.      I GOT THE DAMAGE FIXED, WHICH COST ME NEARLY $1,200. PRIOR TO OWNING MY ESCAPE, I OWNED A FORD ESCORT FOR 10 YEARS, WHICH NEVER HAD A PAINT PROBLEM.

THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED US THAT THE HEAD NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF $3,500.

THIS IS THE SAME SPARK PLUG THAT BLEW OUT AT 108,411 MILES.  WE HAVE CONTACTED MANY MECHANICS TO SEE WHAT OTHER OPTIONS WERE AVAILABLE. WE ATTEMPTED TO HAVE OUR EXPEDITION REPAIRED  BY PLACING A RECOMMENDED PERMANENT THREAD REPLACEMENT INSERT PUT INTO THE #7 CYLINDER; WHICH DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT THE VEHICLE HAS LOW COMPRESSION IN #7 CYLINDER AND NEEDS A NEW ENGINE AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF $6,000.

ON MAY 26, 2006 I LEFT MY VEHICLE IN THE PARKING LOT AT WORK.  IT WAS THE FIRST REALLY HOT DAY (90+ DEGREES) OF THE YEAR.  WHEN I GOT BACK TO MY CAR IT HESITATED WHEN I CRANKED IT.  I CRANKED IT AGAIN AND IT POPPED BACK AND ME AND THEN THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION.  THERE WAS SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE HOOD.  I OPENED THE HOOD (BURNING MY FINGER IN THE PROCESS) AND FOUND PARTS AND PIECES EVERYWHERE.  I TOOK IT TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP AND THE UPPER INTAKE MANIFOLD BLEW APART.  THE DEALER NEVER GAVE US A REASON WHY (WE PUSHED BUT WE WERE TOLD THAT IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED AND THAT THE ENGINEER WAS ON VACATION).    WE HAD THE UPPER INTAKE MANIFOLD FIXED AND IT COST US A LOT OF MONEY OUT-OF-POCKET.  I ASKED THEM FOR THE OLD UPPER INTAKE MANIFOLD BACK, BUT THEY WOULDN'T GIVE IT BACK.  I WAS ALWAYS INTENDING TO FILE A COMPLAINT.  THE FORD WAS 3-YEARS OLD WITH 54,000 MILES ON IT, SO IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, ALTHOUGH THE DEALER STATED THAT IT WAS A FAULTY PART THAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM?  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT WAS N A HORRIBLE MISFIRE, BUT WE AREN'T SURE.  I DO KNOW THAT IT SCARED ME AND COULD HAVE HURT SOMEONE.  LUCKILY THE VEHICLE DID NOT CATCH ON FIRE.      THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED FOR 2-MONTHS WHEN THE VEHICLE STARTED HESITATING AGAIN WHEN I STARTED IT.  I WAS TERRIFIED TO DRIVE IT AND THE DEALER TOLD ME IT WAS UNRELATED BUT I COULD PAY (AGAIN) TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT.  I STARTED HAVING PANIC ATTACKS WHEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE, SO WE TRADED IT IN.

THE CAR WAS NURSED TO THE CLOSEST TOWN AND TAKEN TO A FORD DEALERSHIP FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.  THE SHOP FOREMAN DID AN ON-THE-SPOT DIAGNOSIS WITHOUT TAKING A REAL LOOK UNDER THE HOOD STATING THAT THE PROBLEM WAS MOST LIKELY DUE TO THE ACCELERATOR CABLE BINDING.  THERE WAS ADDITIONAL DAMAGE TO THE CAR'S BRAKES.  WE ASKED FOR AN APPRAISAL OF THE BRAKES, AND FOUR INDIVIDUAL FORD PERSONNEL (ONE SHOP FOREMAN, ONE DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT MANAGER, AND TWO SEPARATE FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSONNEL) STATED THE DAMAGE SUSTAINED WAS UNNECESSARY WEAR DIRECTLY CAUSED BY A DEFECTIVE ACCELERATOR CABLE.  HOWEVER, NONE OF THE PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH FORD WERE WILLING TO REPLACE THE DAMAGED BRAKES UNDER WARRANTY.  THE FINAL PERSON WE SPOKE WITH WENT SO FAR AS TO PUT THE RESPONSIBILITY ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE DEALERSHIP THAT SOLD US THE CAR.  THE ANALOGY GIVEN WAS THAT ALL FORD DEALERSHIPS ARE COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT, AND THAT ANY PROBLEMS WITH A FORD VEHICLE IS THE DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SELLING DEALERSHIP.

THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE NOISE AND CHECKED THE FRONT BRAKES.  THEY CLAIMED TO HAVE MEASURED THE BRAKE PADS AT ABOVE 5MM OF PAD REMAINING.  THE NOISE CONTINUED.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP ON JUNE 27, 2003 (28,720 MILES).  THIS TIME THEY HEARD THE NOISE AS WELL AS A BEARING NOISE. THEY MEASURED THE BRAKES AT 3MM AND TOLD ME THAT THE ROTORS MAY BE WARPED.  I LEFT THE VEHICLE FOR THE BEARING REPAIR AND RECEIVED A PHONE MESSAGE (ON MY ANSWERING MACHINE) THAT THEY RE-MEASURED THAT BRAKE PADS AND FOUND THEM TO BE 2MM NOT 3MM.  THEY DIDN'T MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT THE ROTORS.  I ASKED ABOUT THE EXCESSIVE WEAR OF THE BRAKE PADS AND THEY SAID THAT IT WAS NORMAL WEAR.  THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD DO NOTHING ABOUT THE PADS OR THE ROTORS.  I CALLED MY BROTHER-IN-LAW THAT WORKS FOR FORD AND TOLD HIM ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE.  HE MADE SOME PHONE CALLS AND FOUND OUT FROM ONE OF FORD'S ENGINEERS THAT THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH BRAKE WEAR (BOTH PADS AND ROTORS) ON THE ESCAPE AND THE FORD FOCUS.  TODAY (30,270 MILES) I TOOK MY ESCAPE TO MIDAS AND HAD A BRAKE INSPECTION.  THE MIDAS EMPLOYEE SAID THAT THE ROTORS ARE WORN DOWN BELOW SPECS AND NEED TO BE REPLACED.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THE ROTORS SHOULD NOT WEAR THAT QUICKLY.  AS TO THE PADS HE SAID THAT IT WAS NORMAL WEAR BECAUSE THEY ARE CERAMIC PADS.  I WENT TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP IN VACAVILLE WITH THIS INFORMATION.  THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT FORD COULD DO FOR ME ABOUT THE BRAKE ROTORS.  THE INDIVIDUAL TOLD ME THAT FORD USES SOFT ALUMINUM ROTORS ON BOTH THE ESCAPE AND THE FOCUS AND THEY WEAR OUT VERY QUICKLY.  MY CONCERN FOR FORD IS THAT IF THEY USE SUBSTANDARD EQUIPMENT AND DO NOT SEEM TO BE CONCERNED, ARE THEY NOT OPENING THEMSELVES UP TO A LAW SUIT IF THEIR \"SOFT ROTORS\" FAIL AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  *AK",
