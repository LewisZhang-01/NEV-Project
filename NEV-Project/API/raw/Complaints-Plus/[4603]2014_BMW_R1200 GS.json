I RETURNED THE BIKE TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY REPLACED THE FORKS UNDER WARRANTY. THIS WAS AUGUST OF 2016. SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE HEARD OF NUMEROUS ACCOUNTS OF THIS INCIDENT HAPPENING. A FELLOW MOTORCYCLE IS CREATED CLAMPS THAT WOOD CLAMP AROUND THE FORK TUBE TO SECURE IT BETTER AND FOR SAFETY REASONS. I INVESTED THE$140 AND RECEIVED A PAIR OF STANCHION SUPPORT.

THIS IS LESS THAN A YEAR AND LESS THAN 1500 MILES OF MOSTLY HIGHWAY TRAVEL. THIS IS NOW A KNOWN PROBLEM AMONGST THE GS COMMUNITY AND WRITERS OR PURCHASING THE SUPPORT EVERYWHERE. BMW SHOULD REALIZE THAT THERE IS A CHALLENGE HERE. I WILL RETURN MY BIKE TO THE DEALERSHIP IN HOPES OF THEM REPLACING THE FORKS ONCE AGAIN UNDER WARRANTY.

THE TWO MOST RECENT TIMES THIS HAS HAPPENED PRESENTED A HAZARD TO MYSELF AND TO OTHER ROAD USERS. I HAVE TAKEN THE BIKE TO MY LOCAL BMW DEALER, THEY OPENED A PUMA CASE AS THEY WERE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM, NOR WERE THEY ABLE TO FIND A SOLUTION. I DID CONTACT BMW DIRECTLY WHO TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO AND THAT THEY WERE SORRY BUT HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE PROBLEM COULD BE. THE 1ST TIME THIS HAPPENED I WAS IN 5TH GEAR, TRAVELING AT APPROXIMATELY 58 MPH, THE TEMPERATURE WAS IN THE LOW 50'S FAHRENHEIT, I WAS TRAVELING UP A SLIGHT UPHILL PAVED HIGHWAY ROAD AT AROUND 9PM, WITH A 7-10% GRADIENT, WHEN THE ENGINE COMPLETELY STALLED, LIGHTS STAYED ON, DISPLAY SHOWED \"TURN OFF OR CANCEL.\"  I TURNED THE BIKE OFF, THEN BACK ON AND MADE MY WAY HOME. I TOOK THE BIKE TO THE DEALER THE FOLLOWING DAY. THEY RAN A LOAD TEST ON THE BATTERY AND SAID THAT WAS MOST LIKELY THE CAUSE. I REPLACED THE BATTERY WITH A NEW BMW BATTERY. I THEN WENT ON ANOTHER TRIP. THE BIKE STALLED AGAIN, ENGINE DIED OUT COMPLETELY,  I WAS LANE SPLITTING ON A VERY LARGE AND BUSY FREEWAY. I WAS ABLE TO COAST TO THE EMERGENCY LANE. I WAS IN 2ND GEAR TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 20-30 MPH WHEN IT DIED. THE TEMPERATURE WAS HIGH 90'S, AROUND 2PM. IT HAPPENED AGAIN IN PHOENIX, I WAS IN 3RD GEAR, LATE AFTERNOON, 105 FAHRENHEIT WHEN THE ENGINE CUT OUT COMPLETELY. THE HIGHWAY CUT OUT AND THE MOST RECENT CUT OUT IN PHOENIX WERE DANGEROUS SCENARIOS AND I FELT THE ENGINE CUTTING OUT WITHOUT WARNING IS A DEFINITE HAZARD TO MYSELF AND TO OTHER ROAD USERS. THERE ARE REPORTS OF OTHER RIDERS HAVING THIS SAME ISSUE. BMW DOES NOT CARE, SO I THOUGHT I WOULD REPORT THIS DANGEROUS SITUATION TO THE NHTSA. THANK YOU.  *TR",
