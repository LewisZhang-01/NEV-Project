THE METAL FUEL LINE SITS IN A WELL OF THE REAR TANK AND WAS COMPLETELY COVERED WITH DIRT/MOISTURE/RAW FUEL.  THE TANK WAS REMOVED AND WE IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THAT THE METAL PORTION OF THE FUEL MODULE METAL PIPING WAS RUSTED THRU AND THAT WAS WHERE THE RAW FUEL WAS BEING SPRAYED/POOLING IN THE WELL AREA.  THE DESIGN OF THE FUEL TANK & MODULE CREATES A PERFECT LOCATION FOR DIRT/MOISTURE TO ACCUMULATE.  ANY TYPE OF IGNITION SOURCE COULD HAVE CAUSED A CATASTROPHIC FIRE AND POSSIBLE EXPLOSION.  THE REMOVED ORIGINAL FUEL MODULE WAS IN PERFECT WORKING CONDITION EXCEPT FOR THE ROTTED METAL PORTION OF THE MODULE.  I REPLACED THE ROTTED FUEL MODULE WITH A NEW GM OEM FUEL MODULE.  THIS NEW MODULE HAS THE SAME EXACT CONSTRUCTION AS THE ORIGINAL PART.  SINCE THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY TO CLEAN OR KEEP CLEAN THE WELL AREA OF THE TANK, I CAN ONLY ASSUME THE NEW OEM PART WILL DETERIORATE IN THE SAME MANNER.  THE VEHICLE HAD ABOUT 34000 MILES ON IT WHEN THE CONDITION OCCURRED.  SINCE IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY THE NEW MODULE COSTS FOR LABOR AND PARTS WAS IN EXCESS OF $1000.00.

THIS TIME THE DEALERSHIP HAD THE VEHICLE FOR 2 WEEKS TO AND DETERMINED THE ENGINE HAD EXCESSIVE CARBON BUILD UP AND A ENGINE SOAK WAS PERFORMED ALONG WITH SPLASH GUARDS ADDED TO THE VALVE COVERS TO KEEP THE ENGINE OIL FROM ESCAPING AS THE AFM WAS OPEARTIONAL.

I HAVE CHANGED THE OIL EVERY 3,000 MILES AND STARTED USING FULL SYNTHETIC MOTOR OIL SINCE MY ENGINE ISSUES AT 33,000 MILES. GM IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE WITH THE AFM AND CONTINUES TO DO NOTHING.

AFTER 10 MINUTES, THE TRUCK WAS ABLE TO START AND CONTINUE THE REST OF THE TRIP.  AFTER DOING SOME INTERNET RESEARCH, THIS PROBLEM IS WELL DOCUMENTED ON VARIOUS CHEVY FORUMS AND  CAR MESSAGE BOARDS.  REPLACING THE MEGA FUSE AND BATTERY CABLES APPEARS TO SOLVE THE MAJORITY OF THE ISSUES AS IT DID IN MY CASE.  THE DEFECTIVE MEGA FUSE AND BATTERY CABLES CAUSED THE EXCESSIVE VOLTAGE THROUGH THE CABLES, CAUSING EXTREME HEAT WHICH RESULTED IN SCORCH MARKS ON THE TERMINAL ENDS OF THE BATTERY CABLES AND THE INSULATION OF THE CABLES CHANGING COLOR AS  WELL AS THE ABOVE ISSUES.

THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED THE OWNER THAT BOTH REAR BRAKE SLAVE CYLINDERS HAD FAILED AND LEAKED HYDRAULIC FLUID ONTO THE LININGS.
