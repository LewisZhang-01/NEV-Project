It's been unusually cold here in Washington state this winter with temperatures in Seattle dipping well below freezing. I see that there is a recall for this exact problem for my exact car (https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2009/RCONL-09V468-4248.pdf). But when I called the dealer (Michael's Bellevue Subaru), and then subsequently called Subaru (1-800-SUBARU3), they told me that they will not fix this issue, since this recall does not apply to my state (Washington). I think that's not right. It is the exact same problem of cold weather causing this fuel line to leak, and they should honor this recall.",

FIRST I THINK YOU HAVE UNDERESTIMATED THE FIRE DANGER.  TRUE THERE HAVE BEEN NO FIRES CAUSED DIRECTLY BY THIS PROBLEM (I THINK), BUT THE PROBLEM ONLY OCCURS IN THE COLD, THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW WRXS (WHEN COMPARED TO FORD EXPLORERS), AND PEOPLE WHO DRIVE THEM NORMALLY ARE GEARHEADS AND TAKE PRETTY GOOD CARE OF THEIR CARS--I.E. WHEN THEY SMELL FUEL THEY FIX THEIR CAR RAPIDLY, OR THEY HAVE ALREADY MODIFIED THEIR CAR WITH DIFFERENT FUEL LINES AND NO LONGER HAVE THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE TO QUESTION HOW THOROUGHLY YOU INVESTIGATED THIS ISSUE SINCE YOUR INVESTIGATION ONLY LASTED 5 MONTHS.  WERE INDEPENDENT TESTS PERFORMED?  FROM YOUR STATEMENT YOU SEEM TO BE TAKING SUBARU'S WORD.  THE SMELL CONTINUES AFTER THE CAR IS RUNNING, SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF FUEL ARE INVOLVED, AND THE FUEL DRIPS ONTO THE ENGINE BLOCK OR TURBO-VERY HOT COMPONENTS.  I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS ISN'T A FIRE HAZARD.  SECONDLY, THE FUMES ARE NOXIOUS.  THE FIRST TIME THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED I WAS TRANSPORTING MY NEWBORN BABY DAUGHTER HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL.  THIS IS OUR ONLY CAR.  PLEASE CONSIDER IF YOU WOULD LIKE YOUR CHILD RIDING AROUND IN A VEHICLE WITH THIS PROBLEM.  I THINK THIS IS AS MUCH OF A SAFETY HAZARD AS THE FIRE DANGER.  I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HELP WITH ANY INVESTIGATION.  I WILL PROVIDE AN OFFICIAL STATEMENT, OR ALLOW YOU TO COME TO MY HOME DO ANY DIAGNOSTICS YOU WOULD LIKE TO MY CAR.  I HAVE TO ADMIT, I AM SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED AT NHTSA'S RESPONSE TO THIS ISSUE.  IT SEEMS THAT MANY HAVE REPORTED THIS ISSUE, AND THE INVESTIGATION HAS NOT BEEN REOPENED.  AS A FEDERAL EMPLOYEE I KNOW IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC.  I HOPE YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY.
