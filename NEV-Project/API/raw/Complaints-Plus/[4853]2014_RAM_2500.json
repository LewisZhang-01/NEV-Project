Truck failure on highway with NO shoulder with NO option but to stop put whole rig in danger of collision. After internet research we pulled appropriate fuse & drove into park. Upon return home 2500 was driven to Russell Barnett Dodge for inspection and repair. Cost to us $721.05 due to no warranty. 4wd service lite appeared while trying to engage.  After repair, and approx 200 miles later during an out of state trip pulling horse trailer, the 2500 service lite appeared, and the truck tried to engage 4wd at 65 mph on interstate highway with the same noise.  Again pulled fuse and continued trip.   We have logged each event with Ram corporate and obtained case numbers. They did not feel this was a safety issue, was not covered under warranty, and our responsibility. So the first repair did NOT work and failed again 2nd time. Ram still would not cover repair & dealer repair shop is saying it\u2019s a different module.  But all symptoms were identical from first event. We feel this is a safety issue - on highways pulling a trailer and potentially becoming a moving obstacle for other drivers if the truck had engaged 4wd at high speed.",

I ASKED FOR SUPPORT IN THAT YOU ENGAGE WITH RAM ABOUT THESE FAILURES THAT I AND OTHER HAVE REPORTED ON YOUR WEB SITE.   FURTHERMORE, AM HOPING YOU FOLKS ARE NOT GULLIBLE ENOUGH TO BELIEVE RAM ON CURRENT RECALL THAT SAYS TRANSMISSION FLUID CAN COME OUT OF THE DIPSTICK TUBE AND THE CORRECTIVE ACTION IS TO REPLACE THE SEPERATOR PLATE IN THE VALVE BODY !!! WHILE THE ENGINE IS RUNNING, OIL WILL CONTINUE TO CYCLE THRU TRANSMISSION AND COOLER ...... HIGHLY UNLIKELY IT WILL COME OUT OF DIPSTICK TUBE BECAUSE THE SEPERATOR PLATE GASKET FAILED.  WHAT IS MOST LIKELY TO HAPPEN IS WHAT I EXPERIENCED , THAT WHEN THE SEPERATOR PLATE FAILED, HYDRAULIC PRESSURE IS SUDDENLY LOST AT CERTAIN VALES IN THE VALVE BODY SIMULTANEOUSLY ROUTING HYDRAULIC PRESSURE WHERE ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO GO RESULTING IN ACCUMULATOR PISTON FAILURE AND EVENTUALLY COMPLETE VALVE BODY FAILURE RESULTING IN TOTAL TRANSMISSION FAILURE.  PLEASE DON'T ALLOW RAM TO \" BS \" YOU BY SAYING OIL WILL COME OUT OF THE DIPSTICK TUBE AND WHY THEN I ASK, PER THE RECALL LETTER, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RE-PROGRAMMING THE PCM !

SOMETIMES ONLY THE DRIVER SIDE OPENED AND SOMETIMES NOT AT ALL. THE SAME WENT FOR LOCKING THE DOORS. THEY WOULD MAKE A SOUND TO LICK BUT THEY WOULD NOT ACTIVATE THE LOCKING MECHANISM. I WOULD HAVE TO USE THE KEY TO MANUALLY UNLOCK THE DRIVER DOOR AND THEN TRY TO RAPIDLY TAP THE UNLOCK BUTTON INSIDE THE DOOR. IT WOULD WORK SOMETIMES. OTHER TIMES I WOULD MANUALLY PULL ON THE STEM TO OPEN THE PASSENGER DOORS BUT IF YOU TRIED TO UNLOCK THEM UNSUNG THE ELECTRONICS FIRST, THEY WOULD BE STUCK IN THIS HALF WAY POSITION AND WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE PULLED UP TO UNLOCK THE PASSENGER DOOR.  WHEN THE DOORS COULD NOT BE LOCKED USING THE ELECTRONIC LOCKS THEN THE DOOR STEM WOULD HAVE TO BE PUSHED DOWN ON ALL DOORS. THE PROBLEM WAS THAT UNLOCKING WITH A KEY AFTER TRIGGERED THE ALARM AND IT WOULD NOT STOP UNTIL AN UNLOCK SIGNAL WAS SENSED. THIS TOOK PUSHING THE FOB ENDLESS TIMES. SOMETIMES WITHOUT SUCCESS.   THE REAL DANGER OF THIS PRESENTED ITSELF WHEN WE STOPPED DRIVING AND HAD TO RAPIDLY EXIT THE VEHICLE DUE TO EMERGENCY. THE DOORS WOULD NOT UNLOCK. THE DOOR HANDLES WOULD NOT WORK ON THE PASSENGER DOORS TRAPPING MY 3 KIDS IN THE BACK SEATS. I COULD NOT MANUALLY PULL ON THE STEM HARD ENOUGH TO OPEN THE DOORS. FYI, THE MANUAL CHILD LOCKS WERE OFF. THIS INCIDENT SCARED ME THINKING IF THERE WAS A FIRE OR ROLL OVER AND WE COULDN'T GET OUT MANUALLY OR ELECTRICALLY. ALSO FOR SAFETY WE HAVE THE LOCKS MANUALLY ACTIVATE AFTER DRIVING A BIT. THIS DOESN'T WORK SOMETIMES ANYMORE SO WE ARE LEFT VULNERABLE TO CAR JACKINGS. THESE ISSUES OCCUR MOSTLY WHEN TEMPERATURES CHANGE OUTSIDE (HUMIDITY?). FORUMS SPOKE OF LOCKING MECHANISMS BEING CHANGED WITHOUT CORRECTING THE ISSUE. ONLY CHANGING THE BCM BODY CONTROL MODULE FIXED THE PROBLEM IN EVERY CASE.",

MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS ISSUE.  SEE BELOW:    CONTINENTAL MAKES THE ITBM FOR CHRYSLER TO CHRYSLER'S REQUIREMENTS.    ITBM WAS REDESIGNED FOR MY13 AND WAS USED IN 2013 AND 2014 PRODUCTION WHICH HAD A NEWLY DESIGNED ELECTRICAL ARCHITECTURE INTRODUCED FOR THE 2013 MODEL YEAR. THE NEW ARCHITECTURE CHANGED THE TRADITIONAL BRAKE SWITCH SIGNAL AND MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR AFTER MARKET TRAILER BRAKE SOLUTIONS UNTIL THE AFTER MARKET DEVELOPED AN INTERFACE CABLE.    CHRYSLER AGAIN CHANGED THE BRAKE SIGNAL BACK TO TRADITIONAL SIGNALING BUT FOR AN UNKNOWN REASON (AND ALSO UNDOCUMENTED), DESIGNED A 70% MAXIMUM OUTPUT FROM THE ITBM AT SPEEDS BELOW 30MPH. WHAT MAKES THIS MOVE MORE MYSTERIOUS IS THE MANUAL SLIDE ON THE ITBM, TYPICALLY USED TO SET THE GAIN OF THE ITBM'S OUTPUT, WILL NOT PUT OUT MAXIMUM BRAKING, BUT IS ALSO LIMITED TO THE 70% RULE MAKING SETTING YOUR GAIN IMPOSSIBLE AS INSTRUCTED BY THE OWNERS' MANUAL.    WE ARE ALL WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN FROM CHRYSLER, ALL THAT IS NEEDED IS A SOFTWARE UPDATE.

ADDITIONALLY, IN MY COLD CLIMATE WHEN HEAT IS DIRECTED TO THE FLOOR I HAVE HOT AIR BLOWING INTO MY FACE AND EYES THAT I CANNOT PREVENT.    THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN TAKEN TO DEALER SERVICING ON TWO OCCASIONS. BOTH TIMES THE SERVICER 'FLASHED' THE HVAC SYSTEM AND REPORTED THAT IT IS OPERATING AS DESIGNED.
