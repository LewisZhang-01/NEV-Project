THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASE (USED), BEING THE HOSE ITSELF IS HARD TO SEE, THE LEAK WAS SMALLER THEN, AND IT HAD A CORRUGATED PLASTIC TUBING WRAPPED AROUND IT FOR ABRASION PROTECTION, DIVERTING THE LEAKS. NOW IT'S LEAKING BADLY. THE HOSE IS BENT IN A CURVE, AND THE LEAKS ARE ALL ALONG THE OUTER PERIMETER (STRETCHED) SIDE OF THE HOSE. I DISCOVERED THE REPLACEMENT STEEL LINE HAS BEEN REDESIGNED TO A LONGER UNIT WITH TWO STRAIGHT RUBBER SECTIONS THAT MUST BE REROUTED, WHICH TOLD ME THE ORIGINAL HAD A DESIGN FLAW THAT LED TO FAILURES. I CHECKED TO SEE IF THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS, AND THERE IS, BUT ODDLY MY VIN SEEMS TO 'NOT BE INCLUDED'. RECALL #05V455000 IS DATED 10/5/2005, AND THE DATE MY CAR WAS BUILT IS 09/05 ACCORDING TO THE DOOR DECAL. THE RECALL STATES: 'CONSEQUENCE: IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR, POWER STEERING ASSIST WOULD BE LOST AND INCREASED STEERING EFFORT WOULD BE REQUIRED. ON VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH HYDRO-BOOST POWER BRAKES, IT COULD ALSO RESULT IN LOSS OF POWER BRAKE ASSIST AND INCREASED BRAKING EFFORT WOULD BE REQUIRED. IF THE POWER STEERING FLUID SPRAY WERE TO SPRAY ONTO HOT ENGINE PARTS, AN ENGINE COMPARTMENT FIRE COULD OCCUR.'  THE DEALERSHIP INSISTS MY VIN IS NOT EFFECTED, BUT YET I CLEARLY HAVE THIS PROBLEM NOW ON A HOSE THAT IS NOTHING LIKE THE NEWLY-DESIGNED ONES. I THINK GM MUST INCLUDE MY VIN AND ALL ADDITIONAL ONES WITH THIS OLD STYLE HOSE INSTALLED, I THINK IT 'SLIPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS'. IT'S SPRAYING FLUID ON HOT EXHAUST BENEATH, AND IT LOSES LOTS OF FLUID QUICKLY WHICH CAN LEAD TO STEERING/BRAKE FAILURE. I CAN'T DRIVE THE CAR IN THE STATE IT'S IN.",

THE SHIFTER MECHANISM ON THIS AUTOMATIC EQUIPPED VEHICLE WAS OPERATIONAL, BUT THE LINKAGE TO THE TRANSMISSION WAS NO LONGER ENGAGED. THE CAR WAS BEING PULLED INTO THE GARAGE WHEN THIS HAPPENED, SO FORTUNATELY I WAS NOT IN A BUSY INTERSECTION, IN A PARKING LOT, OR IN SOME OTHER LOCATION WHERE I, OR SOMEONE ELSE, MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN HARM'S WAY DUE TO A VEHICLE THAT I COULD NO LONGER CONTROL. SINCE THE CAR COULD NOT BE PUT IN NEUTRAL OR PARK, I HAD TO TURN OFF THE VEHICLE WITH IT IN REVERSE AND USE THE PARKING BRAKE TO KEEP THE CAR FROM MOVING. SINCE THE SHIFTER MECHANISM COULD STILL MOVE, THE SWITCH ACTIVATING THE \"OK TO START\" WOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE CAR TO START WHEN PUT IN THE PARK OR NEUTRAL POSITIONS - WHILE THE TRANSMISSION WAS STILL STUCK IN REVERSE; A REAL SAFETY ISSUE. THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WAS A 50 CENT BUSHING THAT ATTACHES TO THE SHIFT LEVER. THIS BUSHING ALLOWS THE BALL END CONNECTOR OF THE SHIFTER TO ENGAGE A SHIFTER CABLE THAT ACTUATES THE LINKAGE TO THE TRANSMISSION. SO WHEN THAT BUSHING BREAKS, YOU CAN NO LONGER SHIFT THE CAR.

I LIVE IN A SUBURBAN AREA OF MY COUNTY WHERE THERE ISN'T MUCH STREET LIGHTING, WHEN THIS HAPPENED IT WAS VERY SCARY, LUCKILY I DIDN'T CRASH INTO ANYONE OR ANYTHING.    THE NEXT NIGHT I TESTED THE LIGHTS AND THEY CAME ON FINE, BUT AFTER DRIVING ABOUT 20-25 MINUTES THEY SHUT OFF AGAIN, USED THE FOG LIGHTS SO I COULD SEE SOME OF THE ROAD, BUT VISIBILITY IS LOW. I WORK AT NIGHT SO NOW I JUST TURN THE FOG LIGHTS ON WHEN I START THE CAR SO WHEN THE LOW BEAMS TURN OFF I'LL HAVE SOME TYPE OF LIGHT. THE LOW BEAMS TURN OFF EVERY TIME I USE THE CAR, ABOUT 20-25 MINUTES INTO DRIVING THE CAR.

THEY SAID OTHER THAN ON THAT INITIAL INSPECTION THEY WERE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AGAIN SO IN GOOD FAITH THEY COULD NOT JUSTIFY THAT REPLACING THE SWITCH WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM SO THEY DID NOTHING TO THE CAR TO FIX THE LIGHT PROBLEM.

        "summary": "THE DRIVER'S SIDE METAL SEAT FRAME WAS SHATTERED INTO 3 PLACES.  THE SEAT WOULD NOT RECLINE PROPERLY, AND AS I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER WHEN I TOOK IT IN TO BE FIXED:  THE SEAT WAS FLOATING LOOSELY IN THE CAR WHEN IT ARRIVED AT HIS SHOP.  THE CORVETTE HAD ONLY 29,900 MILES ON IT, WAS NOT A DAILY DRIVER, AND HAD ONLY SEEN RECREATIONAL WEEKEND USE.  THE CORVETTE WAS NEVER IN AN ACCIDENT, ALWAYS GARAGED, AND WELL TAKEN CARE OF.  AS AN AEROSPACE ENGINEER, I STRONGLY BELIEVE THERE WAS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT IN THE SEAT FRAME THAT LED TO THIS FAILURE.  THE SEAT HAD ONLY SEEN 29,900 MILES OR LESS OF REGULAR, EVERY DAY USE BEFORE THE FAILURE OCCURRED.  THAT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THERE WERE HAIRLINE FRACTURES IN THE METAL SEAT FRAME BEFORE IT WAS INSTALLED IN MY CORVETTE AT THE ASSEMBLY PLANT.  FAILURES IN BOTH THE SUPPLIER'S MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND CHEVROLET'S QUALITY INSPECTION PROCESS OCCURRED IN THIS INSTANCE.  HAD I BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT WITH A SEAT THAT WAS NOT SECURED TO THE CORVETTE, THE INJURIES I WOULD HAVE SUSTAINED WOULD HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT.  I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH CHEVROLET ABOUT THIS, AND BELIEVE THE COMPLAINT DID NOT RECEIVE THE ATTENTION THAT IT SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED.  THERE WAS NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE FAILED PART, AND I WAS ONLY PARTIALLY REIMBURSED FOR THE COST OF REPAIR.  AS A RESULT, I AM FILING A SEPARATE COMPLAINT WITH THE GOVERNMENT SO THEY CAN PROVIDE THE PROPER OVERSIGHT IN THIS MATTER.  REPAIRS WERE MADE TO THE VEHICLE, AND I WAS CHARGED BECAUSE THE REPAIRS WERE DEEMED BY CHEVROLET TO BE OUT OF BOTH THE 3 YEAR/36,000 MILE WARRANTY DUE TO TIME (THE CORVETTE WAS 4 YEARS OLD), AND THE  AND THE EXTENDED (GMPP) 5 YEAR/60,0000 MILE BUMPER TO BUMPER NO DEDUCTIBLE WARRANTY THAT I HAD PURCHASED FOR $1700 DUE TO THE FACT THAT, AS CHEVROLET SAID, BEING \"NOT COVERED UNDER THE EXTENDED BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY\" I HAD PURCHASED FOR EXTRA. *TR",

THE VEHICLE NOW HAS ROUGHLY 20,000 MILES AND IS OUT OF WARRANTY.

THE DEALER AND GM ARE NOW STATING THAT THE PROBLEM IS RELATED TO DEFECTIVE BPMV AND EBCM UNITS WHICH CONTROL THE ANTILOCK BRAKING SYSTEM AND THE STABILITRACK SYSTEM.  THEY ARE REFUSING TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.

ON THE DATE THE ROOF FLEW OFF, I HAD PARKED THE CAR AT WORK AND IT WAS OVER 100 DEGREES OUTSIDE.  I LEFT THE PARKING LOT, TURNED ONTO A SHORT STREET, AND STOPPED AT A LIGHT.  WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN, I TURNED LEFT AND THE ROOF FLEW OFF AT ABOUT 25 MPH.  IT LANDED IN THE LEFT-TURN LANE OF OPPOSITE TRAFFIC.  I WAS ABLE TO MAKE A U-TURN AND RETRIEVE THE TOP WITHOUT ANYONE HITTING IT.    I'VE TALKED TO THE DEALER AND GM CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE AND GET DIFFERENT STORIES.  THE DEALER INITIALLY SAID THEY COULD NOT ORDER A NEW PART BECAUSE THEY WERE BACK-LOGGED.  THEN GM CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE SAID THAT THE COULDN'T PROVIDE A REPLACEMENT BECAUSE A NEW ROOF WAS BEING DESIGNED AND WOULDN'T BE READY FOR 4-6 WEEKS, AROUND SOMETIME IN AUGUST.  TODAY, THE DEALER SAID THAT THEY WERE GOING TO ORDER A NEW ROOF, HAVE IT PAINTED, AND USE THAT AS A REPLACEMENT.  I TOLD THEM THAT I WAS CONCERNED BECAUSE I HAD READ ON A CORVETTE FORUM WHERE SOME REPAIRED ROOFS HAVE ALSO SEPARATED/DE-LAMINATED IN ADDITION TO THE REPAIR OFTEN LEAVING UGLY GLUE RESIDUE ON THE TOPS.  BUT MOSTLY, I AM HESITANT TO ACCEPT A CURRENT ROOF DUE TO LIABILITY CONCERNS SHOULD ANOTHER ROOF SEPARATE FROM THE CAR AND INJURE ANOTHER DRIVER...ESPECIALLY A MOTORCYCLE RIDER.     SINCE I AM GETTING DIFFERENT RESOLUTIONS FROM THE DEALER AND CUSTOMER SERVICE, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.  HOWEVER, I DID TELL THE DEALER OF MY CONCERNS OF A NEW ROOF SEPARATING AND THAT I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCEPT ANYTHING BUT A REDESIGNED ROOF.  THEY INDICATED THAT AT LEAST I WOULD HAVE A ROOF IN PLACE AND BE ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR.   THEY WEREN'T SURE IF THEY COULD ACTUALLY ORDER ONE OR NOT, BUT FELT THAT THEY COULD AND THAT CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS WRONG IS SAYING THAT ONLY REDESIGNED ROOFS COULD BE ORDERED.     *JB",

SHORTLY AFTER I HAD NOTICED THAT THE REAR PART OF THE PLASTIC ROOF HAD COMPLETELY SEPARATED FROM THE METAL FRAME TO WHICH IT WAS GLUED. I TOOK THE CAR IN TO THE DEALER FOR ACTION AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY WOULD ORDER A NEW ROOF, BUT THAT IT WOULD TAKE 4-5 WEEKS TO GET THE NEW TOP AND THAT IT WOULD TAKE ANOTHER WEEK OR SO TO GET IT PAINTED TO MATCH MY CAR. I INFORMED THEM THAT THERE WAS A DANGER OF THE ROOF POSSIBLY FLYING OFF TO WHICH THEY REPLIED \"JUST GO AHEAD AND DRIVE IT, WE HAVEN'T HEARD OF ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND WE'VE SEE MUCH WORSE THAN YOURS\"  RELUCTANTLY AND WITHOUT CHOICE I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP AND TOOK THE CAR HOME WHERE IT WOULD SIT UNLESS THERE WAS ZERO CHANCE OF RAIN. DUE TO THE SEPARATION, ANY RAIN WOULD GET RIGHT INTO THE PASSENGER CABIN OF THE VEHICLE.       THIS PAST FRIDAY, JUNE 2, 2006, I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER BECAUSE I RECEIVED A LETTER STATING MY TOP WAS IN STOCK. THEY TOLD ME IT WAS IN STOCK, BUT WAS BEING PAINTED AND THAT I WOULD BE CALLED WHEN IT WAS READY. SINCE IT WAS A GOOD DAY WITH NO CHANCE OF RAIN, I DECIDED TO DRIVE THE CAR TO WORK. LEAVING MY OFFICE THAT EVENING AROUND 6, MY ROOF COMPLETELY SEPARATED AND FLEW OFF THE CAR.    I HAD JUST ACCELERATED ONTO THE MAIN ROAD AT A NORMAL PACE. I WAS JUST REACHING AROUND 35-40 MPH WHEN I HEARD A WHOOSH AND SUDDENLY I COULD SEE THE SKY. I SAW THE PANEL LAND IN THE ROAD BEHIND ME, AND WAS ABLE TO MAKE A U-TURN AND RETRIEVE THE PANEL.    I WAS IN CONTACT WITH GM CUSTOMER SERVICE ABOUT THIS AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS OFFER MORE EXCUSES AS TO WHY I STILL HAVE NO ROOF FOR MY CAR AND HOW SORRY THEY WERE. MY CAR HAS BEEN SITTING USELESS IN MY GARAGE NOW FOR AROUND 5 WEEKS.   IF DESIRED, I HAVE DETAILED PICTURES OF THE ROOF AND THE PANEL THAT FLEW OFF, THANKFULLY NO ONE WAS BEHIND ME WHEN IT HAPPENED.  *JB",

THERE WERE NO POPPING, CREAKING OR OTHER SOUNDS. THE ONLY INDICATION OF THE IMPENDING SEPARATION WAS INCREASED WIND NOISE AT HIGHWAY SPEED. THE NOISE BEGAN ONE DAY WHILE AT 70 MPH, AND WOULD STOP IF SPEED WAS REDUCED TO 60 MPH. BY THE TIME I ARRIVED HOME FROM MY 30-MINUTE DRIVE, HOWEVER, SPEEDS OF 55-60 MPH WERE CAUSING THE NOISE, AND OBVIOUS CONTINUED SEPARATION. I MUST USE MY CAR, AND FROM AN ONLINE FORUM, CORVETTEFORUM, I KNEW THAT THOSE TAKING CARS FOR REPAIR BY GM DEALERS ARE WAITING UP TO SEVERAL WEEKS FOR THE REPAIR, WITH NO CAR, SO I PURCHASED A $1600 CLEAR REPLACEMENT PANEL FROM MY OWN FUNDS TO USE FOR NOW.    I FEEL THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE, AND EXTENDS FAR BEYOND THE VEHICLES CHEVROLET WILL ADMIT ARE AFFECTED.    IT SEEMS OBVIOUS THAT SOMEONE WILL EVENTUALLY BE SERIOUSLY INJURED, OR IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE RIGHT THERE COULD EVEN BE DEATH AS AN IMMEDIATE OR SECONDARY RESULT OF ROOF SEPARATION WHILE AT SPEED.     WE OWNERS DESERVE A PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE FIX. THE ATTEMPT BY GM AT FILLING THE VOIDS WITH FOAM GLUE CLEARLY DOES NOT WORK, AS SEEN FROM THOSE RETURNING THE REWORKED TOPS HAVING SUBSEQUENT FAILURE.
