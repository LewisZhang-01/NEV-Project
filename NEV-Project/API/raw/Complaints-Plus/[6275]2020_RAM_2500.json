I looked at my DEF tank gauge as soon as I got the message - it read 1/4 tank.  A couple minutes pass and another message displays - Service Diesel Exhaust System - See Dealer and my truck immediately loses power and dies when i'm in the fast lane - Eastbound I-70 to Denver.  I pulled into the slow lane and finally off the side of the interstate.  I did not go into limp mode, never received the countdown message '250 Miles Until Limp Mode', and the truck would not start once I was on the side of the interstate.  It died just West of Vail Colorado.  The weather was approx 25 degrees and snowing.  I then contacted CFA Roadside Assistance, which came with my purchase.  After speaking with a representative, I was told a tow truck was on the way.  I was then told I needed to get a Taxi to pick me up on the interstate, because I wouldn't be allowed to ride with the tow driver to safety.  The tow never came.  I called CFA a second time, 4 hours later and spoke with a second representative that told me the tow had been canceled.  I was never notified of the tow cancelation and was told CFA would arrange for a second tow.  They never arranged a second tow, and still haven't reached out to check on my condition.  I'm going to reiterate, I was left in freezing, snowing  conditions in the Rocky Mountaints with no way to start my truck and no assistance from the Roadside assistance program I've paid for w/the vehicle purchase.  In a desperate attempt I returned to my vehicle with DEF fluid hoping adding additional DEF would allow me to start the vehicle.  My safety was put at risk trying to fill the DEF tank on a blind interstate curve, in snow and icy conditions, with semi's passing two feet away.  I was not able to restart the truck after adding DEF.  Now my truck as at RAM Silverthorne, and they won't look at it until 2/17/2022.",

The truck sputtered then stalled on the side of interstate 95 (southbound) in South Carolina about 60 miles from the Georgia border.  We were towed to the nearest RAM dealership (Butler Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM) in Beaufort, SC.  The earliest we could get a rental was the following Wednesday (10/20) so decided to stay nearby at a local beach.  We came back through on Friday to finally get our rental and returned home.  Today is 11/4 and we still don't have our truck. I was told the problem was the CP4 Fuel Pump.  Apparently it disintegrated (their words) and threw metal shavings all through the fuel system.  They told me they had to change everything from the fuel tank all the way to the injectors. The last of the parts are supposed to be in later today, so am looking at driving the 5 hours back down to Beaufort SC this or next weekend to pick up the truck depending on when the repairs are made.",

The truck proceeded to completely shut off while driving, rendering me unable to control the vehicle as all systems shut down.   There were no warning lights present or any other warning signs.  It coasted to a stop on the side of the road.  The safety of myself and anyone around me was at high risk as I had no ability to control the vehicle.  The vehicle only has 12,000 miles on it so I had it towed to the closest dealership, Autostar of Hendersonville NC.  It took a week to get a diagnosis because their solitary diesel tech was on vacation.  They offered my no loaner vehicle and FCA has not made an adequate offer to cover the full cost of a loaner vehicle.  The diagnosis on the vehicle was a high pressure fuel pump failure.  I currently have not ETA on parts and no vehicle to drive.  It is my understanding that NHTSA is already investigating this issue.  Multiple attempts made to get help with a loaner vehicle, an ETA on parts/install have all been met with deflection from dealership and FCA customer care representatives.  Any attempt made to inquire if the new fuel pump/system has been adequately updated to ensure this wont happen again has not been answered.  Any attempt made to inquire if this issue has cause long lasting damage to the engine has not been answered.  This is a serious problem and needs to be remedied.

The engine lost power and we had to do an emergency lane change with no engine power, no power steering, no power brakes. We then coasted to the shoulder with traffic passing us and behind us speeding by. Luckily we were near an exit and we barely had enough momentum to get away from traffic. We were lucky to change lanes and exit without getting into a collision with other traffic because we went from highway speed to slow very quickly and had to change lanes and exit. It was the high pressure CP4.2 fuel pump failure the dealer eventually informed us. They also said this is a common problem and they had several other failures just like this.",

NO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS OF NEITHER THE PUMP REVISION IN 2020, NOR THE PUMP CHANGE IN 2021 HAVE BEEN MADE. THE ISSUE IS SO PREVALENT THAT THE REPLACEMENT PUMPS AND REPAIRS GENERALLY HAVE A 30-90 DAY WAIT PERIOD WHERE THE CUSTOMER IS WITHOUT THE PRIMARY VEHICLE. THIS PROBLEM IS A SUBSTANTIATED SAFETY RISK. ACCORDING TO A TEXAS JUDGE IN A BOSCH CP4.2 LAWSUIT, WHEN ANOTHER AUTOMAKER, GM TRIED TO DISMISS THE CASE SAYING THE PUMP FAILURE IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE, THE COURT RESPONDED: \"THE WORST CASE SCENARIO OF A TRUCK SPONTANEOUSLY STALLING AT HIGH SPEEDS IS NOT A MERE INCONVENIENCE. NOR IS IT A MERE INCONVENIENCE TO SPEND BETWEEN $8,000 TO $20,000 ON REPAIRS TO MAKE THE TRUCKS FIT FOR THEIR ORDINARY PURPOSE. THE COURT REJECTS GM'S SUGGESTION THAT THE RISK OF SPONTANEOUS ENGINE FAILURE WHILE DRIVING IS NOT, AS A MATTER OF LAW, UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS, DEPRIVING THE VEHICLES OF FITNESS FOR THEIR PURPOSE OF TRANSPORTATION.\". TOYOTA AGREES: \"IF A VEHICLE STALL OCCURS WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHER SPEEDS, THIS COULD INCREASE THE RISK OF A CRASH\". FCA & RAM HAVE REMEDIED THE SITUATION FOR THE 2021 MODEL YEAR, HOWEVER THE 2019 AND 2020 OWNERS ARE STILL AT RISK. THE NHTSA NEEDS TO FORCE THE HAND OF FCA TO RECALL.",
