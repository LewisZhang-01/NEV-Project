THIS ALSO CAUSES THE WARNING INDICATOR ON THE DASH TO COME UP ADVISING THAT YOU HAVE A BURNT OUT BULB . I HAVE ALREADY HAD MY DRIVERS SIDE REPLACED A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND NOW THE PASSENGER SIDE IS HAVING ISSUES. THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL OTHERS REPORTING THE SAME ISSUE ONLINE. THERE ARE MANY UNITS FOR SALE ON EBAY AND IN THE ITEM DESCRIPTION THEY INDICATE THAT A FEW OF THE LED'S AREN'T WORKING. AN LED CIRCUIT BOARD THAT IS ONLY A FEW YEARS OLD SHOULD NOT HAVE THESE ISSUES AND CONSUMERS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. THIS NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATES SINCE IT AFFECTS SAFETY SINCE THE SIGNAL LIGHTS/HAZARDOUS LIGHTS DON'T FUNCTION PROPERLY. THIS COINCIDES WITH THE RECALL THAT BMW RECENTLY DID FOR A SIMILAR ISSUE IN OTHER MODELS. IT'S THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM!  *JS",
