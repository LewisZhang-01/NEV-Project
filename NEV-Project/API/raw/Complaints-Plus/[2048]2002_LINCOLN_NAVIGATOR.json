APPARENTLY, THE LEASE INCLUDED FREE OIL CHANGES AT THE DEALER, WHICH I WAS NOT AWARE OF. I PRODUCED ALL OF THE RECEIPTS TO SHOW THAT I HAD  THE OIL CHANGED EVERY 3000 MILES (MORE FREQUENTLY THAN REQUIRED) BUT WAS TOLD IT WAS IRRELEVANT SINCE I DIDN'T HAVE THE DEALER DO THE OIL CHANGES. I WAS TOLD THE ENGINE REPLACEMENT WOULD COST $12,000. THE FORD DEALER WAS SO UPSET BY THIS HE OFFERED TO DO IT FOR COST, ABOUT $4500, BUT I JUST WALKED AWAY, EVEN THOUGH THEY SUED AND PUT A $15,000 BLOT ON MY CREDIT RATING.THIS WAS MY THIRD NAVIGATOR LEASE, INCLUDING A 1998 AND 2000 MODEL BEFORE THIS. I PAID TOP DOLLAR FOR THEIR MOST EXPENSIVE VEHICLE AND THIS IS HOW THEY TREAT GOOD CUSTOMERS. NOT TO MENTION BEING STRANDED IN THE DESERT WITH  MY WIFE AND FIVE KIDS. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER FORD AGAIN.    ONE LAST POINT - I HAD JUST HAD THE OIL CHANGED BEFORE I LEFT AND HAD LESS THAN 1000 MILES ON THE CAR WHEN IT BROKE DOWN. I CHECKED THE OIL AND IT WAS MORE THAN 1/2 QUART DOWN. CLEARLY THE CAR WAS USING OIL AT JUST 32000 MILES.
