AS A (RETIRED) MECHANICAL ENGINEER, I DISASSEMBLED THEM TO UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM.  THE DEFECT IS IN THE ANCHOR MECHANISM WITH THE \"PRESS\" BUTTON ON IT. THE \"PRESS\" BUTTON HAS A METAL SPRING MOUNTED ON THE RED PLASTIC PART, AND THE PLASTIC HAS GRADUALLY CRACKED AT THE SPRING MOUNT.  THIS METAL SPRING IS WHAT PUSHES THE METAL BLOCK THROUGH THE RECTANGULAR HOLE IN THE SHOULDER BELT COUPLER, WHEN IT IS PLUGGED INTO THE SEAT BELT ANCHOR AND LATCHED PROPERLY.  EVENTUALLY, THE CRACK GROWS TO THE POINT THAT THE METAL SPRING CANNOT EXERT ENOUGH FORCE TO RELIABLY LATCH TO THE SHOULDER BELT.  IT MAY INITIALLY LATCH AND FEEL SECURE, BUT CAN THEN COME LOOSE SEVERAL MINUTES LATER WHEN DRIVING THE CAR.  I PLAN TO INCLUDE 3 PHOTOS OF THE PROBLEM PART, ONE SHOWING THE CRACK IN THE PLASTIC.    THE VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN IN ANY ACCIDENTS, SO THE SEAT BELT PROBLEM HAS NOT RESULTED IN ANY INJURIES TO MYSELF OR MY PASSENGERS.  THE LOCAL TOYOTA SERVICE DEPARTMENT INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS NO EXTENDED WARRANTY COVERAGE FOR SEAT BELTS, SO I BOUGHT NEW TOYOTA REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR THE DEFECTIVE BELT ANCHORS.    WE LIVE IN THE DESERT, SO LONG-TERM HEAT AND COLD CYCLES COULD BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR.

I WAS DRIVING AT AROUND 35 MPH SOUTH ON WALTHAM STREET IN LEXINGTON, MA. WHEN WE WERE PASSING AN INTERSECTION OF WALTHAM/CONCORD, I STARTED TO SLOW DOWN THE VEHICLE TO AROUND 20 MPH AS OUR HOME APPROACHING. THE CAR SLOWED DOWN NORMALLY TO AROUND 20 MPH AND MAINTAINED AT THAT SPEED FOR ABOUT 100 FEET DISTANCE. AT AROUND 200-300 FEET DISTANCE FROM THE LEXINGTON DRIVE (WHERE OUR APARTMENT LOCATED), THE TOYOTA CAMRY SUDDENLY ACCELERATED BY ITSELF TO AROUND 50-60 MPH, WHILE MY FOOT WAS STILL ON THE BRAKE PEDAL. I WAS IN A COMPLETE STATE OF PANIC, AS WHOLE FAMILY WAS WATCHING (AND SCREAMING) OUR CAR SPEEDING TOWARD THE INTERSECTION OF WALTHAM ST AND LEXINGTON DRIVE, WHERE THERE WAS A TRUCK ALMOST RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. I WAS ALMOST STANDING ON THE BRAKE PEDAL, AND ALSO VERY QUICKLY PULLED THE PARKING BRAKE, AND MOVED THE GEAR SHIFTED TO NEUTRAL. THE CAR SLOWED DOWN TO AROUND 40 MPH. AT THIS TIME, MY CAR WAS ALREADY 30 FEET FROM THE INTERSECTION OF WALTHAM/LEXINGTON DR, WHERE I SUPPOSED TO TURN RIGHT. WITH MY CAMRY MOVING AT AROUND 40 MPH, I DID FEEL SAFE TO MAKE THE RIGHT TURN. AND I COULDN'T?T MOVE FORWARD EITHER WITH A TRUCK NOW RIGHT IN FRONT OF US (THE TRUCK WAS TO MAKE A LEFT TURN FROM LEXINGTON DRIVE TO WALTHAM STREET). THE ONLY OPTION FOR ME WAS TO CRASH MY CAR INTO A STREET DIVIDE ON LEXINGTON DRIVE TO AVOID HITTING THE TRUCK IN FRONT OF US, OR TIP OVER BY TURNING RIGHT AT HIGH SPEED. AFTER CRASHED ON THE STREET DIVIDE, HIT AND DESTROYED A LIGHT POLE ON THE STREET DIVIDE, MY CAR CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP. NO-ONE WAS INJURED PHYSICALLY (LOTS HEADACHE DUE TO PANIC SCREAMING). THE CAR SUFFERED QUITE DAMAGE UNDER AND AT FRONT. AT THIS MOMENT, MY CAR WAS STILL DRIVABLE. INTERESTINGLY, THE CAR WAS RUNNING NORMAL AGAIN THEN.

IF THE BASE SITS FLAT ON THE SEAT OF THE CAR, THE HEAD SITS STRAIGHT UP, LEANING FORWARD FROM THE SEAT OF THE CAR ABOUT 6 INCHES. TIGHTENING IT WITH A BELT DOES NO GOOD BECAUSE IT CONTINUES TO WOBBLE BACK AND FORTH SEVERAL INCHES FROM FRONT TO BACK OR EVEN FROM SIDE TO SIDE. EVEN THE LATCH SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK BECAUSE IT ONLY PULLS THE CARSEAT BACKWARDS, LEAVING A GAP OF SEVERAL INCHES BETWEEN THE BASE AND SEAT OF THE CAR. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS DESIGN. *TR",

TO SUMMARIZE, AFTER A ROUTINE CHECK OF MY ENGINE OIL LEVEL ON OCTOBER 28TH, 2004, I DISCOVERED THAT THE BOTTOM 1- INCHES OF THE ENGINE OIL DIP STICK HAD BROKEN OFF. THE PIECE WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND AND I IMMEDIATELY BECAME CONCERNED AS TO ITS WHEREABOUTS. AT THAT TIME, I VISITED MY LOCAL TOYOTA SERVICE CENTER AND CONTACTED THE SERVICE MANAGER  AFTER EXPLAINING TO THEM THE SITUATION, THEY SAID THERE WAS NO WAY TO DETERMINE HOW THE BREAK  ORIGINATED.                UPON FURTHER INSPECTION OF THE DIP STICK UNDER A MICROSCOPE IT WAS OBVIOUS THERE WAS A CLEAN BREAK ON THE METAL. THIS RULED OUT A BENDING OF THE DIP STICK, AND COULD ONLY MEAN THE METAL BROKE OFF BY RUBBING AGAINST ANOTHER PART OF THE ENGINE, WHICH WAS MY IMMEDIATE CONCERN.    ON SEPTEMBER 15TH, I CONTACTED THE CUSTOMER CENTER TO MAKE THEM AWARE OF MY CONTINUED CONCERN. WE AGREED THAT OBVIOUSLY IF THE DIP STICK WOULD BE FOUND, THE CUSTOMER (MYSELF), WOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF THE LABOR, AS I WAS TAKING A PRO-ACTIVE APPROACH BY LOOKING INTO THE MATTER.            ON THE 27TH OF SEPTEMBER, I VISITED TOYOTA TO GET THE WORK DONE. ONCE THE PAN WAS PULLED, THE 1- INCH PIECE OF THE DIP STICK WAS FOUND IN THE OIL PAN. UPON RE-INSPECTION OF THE ENGINE WITH THE DIP STICK MOUNTED NORMALLY, THE TECHNICIAN AND MYSELF WERE ABLE TO SEE NO INTERFERENCE. HOWEVER, ONCE WE MOUNTED THE DIP STICK BACKWARDS, IT CAME INTO CONTACT WITH PART OF THE ENGINE. ALTHOUGH THE DIP STICK IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE INSERTED THAT WAY, IT STILL SHOULD NOT COME INTO CONTACT WITH ANY PART OF THE MOTOR AND WE CONCLUDED THIS WAS THE REASON FOR THE BREAK.           I WAS GIVEN ZERO ASSISTANCE FROM TOYOTA AFTER THIS, AND WAS NOT REIMBURSED FOR THE $270 THAT WAS PAID IN GOOD FAITH. THIS IS WHY I AM CONTACTING YOU TODAY.  *JB",

AS A FOLLOW-UP, I CALLED TOYOTA AGAIN AND THEY FLAGGED A SERVICE CALL FOR MICAHEL'S TOYOYTA TO SCHEDULE SERVICE WITHIN 24 HOURS. BUT TILL DATE, THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED. I HAVEN'T BEEN CALLED BY THEM FOR SCHEDULING A SERVICE. I TOOK THE CASE AGAIN WITH TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY HAVE AGAIN NOTIFIED MICHAELS' TOYOTA TO SCHEDULE THE SERVICE. I FEEL I'M JUST WASTING MY TIME CALLING THEM UP AND THOUGHT OF BRINGING THE ISSUE WITH NHTSA SO AS TO MAKE THEM AWARE THAT TOYOTA IS NOT TAKING THESE RECALLS SERIOUSLY AND NOT GIVING ENOUGH IMPORTANCE TO THIS ISSUE. I'M QUITE CONCERNED ABOUT MY AND MY FAMILY'S SAFETY AND THE DEALERSHIP DOESN'T TAKE IT AS A PRIORITY - MAYBE BECAUSE IT'S A FREE SERVICE. THEY'RE NOT GETTING PAID FOR THIS AND MYBE CONSIDERING THIS AS A WASTE OF TIME. HOPE SOME MESAURES WILL BE TAKEN IN FUTURE SO THAT MANUFACTURERS AND DEALERS DO NOT TAKE PEOPLE FOR A RIDE AND FOLLOW NHTSA GUIDELINES. P.S. I BOUGHT MY CAR THRU' KEARNY MESA TOYOTA, SAN DIEGO AND MOVED TO BELLEVUE, WA IN MAY, THAT WAS THE TIME WHEN I GOT THIS RECALL NOTICE AND SCHEDULED THE SERVICE WHEN I SETTLED IN MY NEW APARTMENT.
