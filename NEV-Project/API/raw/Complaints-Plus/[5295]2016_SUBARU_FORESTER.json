Sometimes both warning lights illuminate when someone sits in the front passenger seat, sometimes they do not illuminate at all and everything seems fine. Other times, the lights illuminate when no one is sitting in the front passenger seat. Additionally, sometimes the seatbelt alarm sounds when no one is sitting in the front passenger seat. However, this is also inconsistent.   In August 2021, the Subaru dealership told me that the issue is likely caused by water damage (a spill) on the front passenger seat that has caused the sensors within the seat to malfunction.

The issue stranded my family on two separate occasions requiring a jump start.  Once was late at night in a secluded area, the other in a parking lot.  We have two other cars from different makes and have not had this issue.    In one case the car was off in a parking lot with my wife waiting for 15 minutes.  In the other my daughter was listening to the radio while parked for less than 10 minutes.  This Forester has the stock radio with no after market mods.    The Forester drives great and feels very safe in all other respects.  We truly love the car.  But I have to make sure that we do not park the car and leave the key in the ignition or the battery will die.  I asked my mechanic to check the battery, but he said that the battery itself tested fine.  Seems like this problem has been reported elsewhere.    Thanks",

A couple of times it was towed to the dealership in Bozemanwhere I bought it (Gallatin Motors) for diagnosis and repairs (bad/dead battery). The battery was replaced Once per Subaru's policy. Then I was on my own for repeated, totally unexplained DEAD battery upon trying to start the car after a couple/ few days/ nothing left on.  I finally bought my own new recommended Interstate Battery after repeated dead out non starts. I bought a Duracell battery maintainer/ conditioner to install in my garage, which I use when the vehicle sits for more than 2 or 3 days to be sure the darn battery will start the car. It's obvious to me there's a parasitic battery drain in this smart car, but no one from any dealership will acknowledge/ has any advice about this! This is discussed in multiple online forums. I love the car and it's smarts, but not turning Dead Off after I'm finished driving it - and draining the battery making it impossible to start again without a jump - is totally not acceptable for a \"vehicle.\"",

Safety risk: During this incident we were stopped on the freeway with no way to accelerate, which was very dangerous. We were lucky to be next to the shoulder lane.

WITHIN AN HOUR OF LEAVING THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT SHE WAS DRIVING 70 MPH ON THE INTERSTATE WHEN HER \"LOW FUEL\" WARNING LIGHT CAME ON. ACCORDING TO THE SUBARU, THAT MEANS 2.6 GALLONS OF GAS REMAIN.

WITHIN A MINUTE OF THE LOW FUEL LIGHT COMING ON, THE ACCELERATOR FAILED TO WORK AND ALL THE WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON THE DASH. WHILE TRAVELING AT 70 MPH ON THE INTERSTATE, SHE HAD TO CROSS 3 LANES OF TRAFFIC TO PULL OVER ON THE SHOULDER. VERY SHAKEN AND CRYING, SHE CALLED GRAYSON SUBARU AND THEY SENT A TOW TRUCK.

I WILL NOTE THAT IT HAD JUST STOPPED SPRINKLING AND THE ROAD WAS DAMP.     ISSUE 1: DURING MY SKID, THE SKID CONTROL FEATURE NEVER ENGAGED (WHICH IS A MARKETED FEATURE AND A REASON I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE). I HAD TO FIGHT THE SKID ON MY OWN.

AFTER FIGHTING TO PREVENT MY VEHICLE FROM ROLLING OVER AND SKIDDING OUT OF CONTROL, I ULTIMATELY CRASH ON THE SHOULDER OF THE FREEWAY, HITTING A LIGHT POST.

THIS CAR MAKES ME FEEL UNSAFE ON ICE AT ANY SPEED AND IS A LITTLE BIT HAIR RAISING JUST ON WET PAVEMENT. WHY IT WOULD SHIFT TO THE LEFT ON THE SMALLEST OF BUMPS AND EVEN ON DRY PAVEMENT (WORSE ON WET PAVEMENT) IS BEYOND ME. RECENTLY THE CONTROL ARMS AND TIE RODS HAD TO BE REPLACED AT 102K MILES. AFTER THAT REPAIR THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND AIR SENSORS HAD TO BE REPLACED. THIS CAR SEEMS LIKE A LEMON TO ME. I BOUGHT THIS NEW CAR FIGURING I WOULDN'T HAVE ISSUES I'VE HAD WITH USED CARS. I ENTERED A DATE OF 2016 WHEN THIS HAPPENED SINCE IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE I BOUGHT THIS CAR ALTHOUGH IT HAPPENS EVERY TIME I'M ON ICE.",

ALL THREE TIMES MY CAR SCREEN SHOWED THAT I HAD BETWEEN 60 AND 80 MILES LEFT IN MY TANK AND MY FUEL GAUGE WHICH SHOW TWO CLICKS TO THE RIGHT OF EMPTY. THE FIRST TIME I THOUGHT IT COULD BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT I NEEDED GAS IN MY CAR . AT THAT POINT I CONTACTED AAA AND THEY BROUGHT ME 2 GALLONS OF GAS TO GET ME TO THE NEXT EXIT TO SO THAT I CAN FILL MY TANK. THE SECOND  TIME I HAD MOVED OVER TO THE EMERGENCY LANE  AS MY CAR WAS DYING. I HAD WAITED ABOUT 10 MINUTES WHILE I WAS WAITING ON AAA AGAIN TO SHOW UP WHEN I DECIDED TO START MY CAR AND THE ENGINE STARTED. I WAS LITERALLY 2/10 OF A MILE FROM THE GAS STATION SO I HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION TO FILL MY TANK. THE THIRD TIME AS I WAS INCLINING ON A HILL  IN THE FAST LANE, THE ENGINE SUDDENLY DIED AS I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 70 MILES AN HOUR. FORTUNATELY I THOUGHT FAST AND HIT THE EMERGENCY FLASHERS AS I HAD A SEMI RIGHT BEHIND MY CAR. THIS TIME I MOVED OVER INTO THE LEFT SIDE EMERGENCY LANE AND WAITED ABOUT 10 MINUTES AND MY CAR STARTED AGAIN. THIS SEEMS TO ALWAYS HAPPEN WHEN THE CAR IS SHOWING BETWEEN 60 AND 90 MILES OF GAS LEFT IN MY TANK AND ALWAYS WITH TWO CLICKS ON THE FULL GAGE.

I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED IT IN 2016, JOSEPH SUBARU IN FLORENCE, KY ON AUGUST 2, 2017.  THE TECHNICIAN DIAGNOSED A SWITCH MALFUNCTION UNDER THE PASSENGER SEAT.  THE SERVICE MANAGER ASSURED ME THAT THE PART WOULD BE ORDERED AND THE VEHICLE WOULD BE SCHEDULED FOR REPAIR.  AFTER THREE WEEKS WITH NO RESPONSE, I CALLED JOSEPH SUBARU TO ASK ABOUT THE STATUS.  HE ASSURED ME ME THAT THE PART HAD BEEN ORDERED ON AUGUST 2 AND THAT I COULD EXPECT THE PART TO BE AVAILABLE AFTER ONE MONTH.  THE PART WAS NEVER MADE AVAILABLE.  I CONTACTED SUBARU OF AMERICA ON OCTOBER 2, 2017 TO REGISTER A COMPLAINT.  I GOT NO RESPONSE.  I CONTACTED SUBARU ELECTRONICALLY ON OCTOBER 23, 2017.  I RECEIVED A CLAIM NUMBER SR #:1-27120984562.  IT IS NOW DECEMBER 6, 2017 AND I HAVE RECEIVED NO REPAIR AND NO CLARIFICATION.  NO ONE HAS MADE ANY EFFORT TO CORRECT THE FAULT.  IT IS A HAZARD TO ME AND ANY RIDERS IN MY VEHICLE.",

AFTER A FEW SECONDS OF THE ENGINE REVVING AS HIGH AS IT COULD, THE ENGINE SHUT OFF AND I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR STOPPED.  I HAD TO PUT MY HAZARDS ON AND STEER OFF TO THE SHOULDER TO AVOID GETTING HIT FROM BEHIND.  THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME TWICE.  FIRST TIME 10/8/15 THE CAR WOULD NOT START AFTER I COASTED TO A STOP AND HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO THE SUBARU DEALER.  THEY HOOKED THE CAR UP TO THEIR COMPUTER FOR A DIAGNOSTIC TEST AND FOUND NO ERROR CODES.  SECOND TIME THIS HAPPENED TO ME ON 1/2/16 AFTER STOPPING ON THE SHOULDER I WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE CAR AND DRIVE HOME WITHOUT USING CRUISE CONTROL.  THE CAR IS GOING BACK TO THE DEALER FOR ANOTHER TEST THIS FRIDAY 1/8/16.  THIS WHOLE PROCESS PROBABLY TAKES ABOUT 30 SECOND OR SO.  BUT ITS VERY DANGEROUS.    ITS ALMOST AS IF THE TRANSMISSION IS SOME HOW NOT ENGAGED.  SINCE THE CRUISE IS SET AT 65 MPH IT TRIES TO INCREASES ENGINE RPM TO MAINTAIN 65 MPH SPEED BUT THE TRANSMISSION IS NOT ENGAGED SO CAR DOES NOT ACCELERATE.  CRUISE SEES CAR SLOWING DOWN SO SPEEDS UP THE ENGINE TO COMPENSATE.  CARS STILL DOESN'T SPEED UP.  EVENTUALLY ENGINE RPM MAXES OUT FOR A FEW SECONDS AND TURNS ITSELF OFF.  I FEEL LIKE THE PROBLEM LIES WITH THE TRANSMISSION MOST LIKELY OR POSSIBLY THE CRUISE CONTROL.
