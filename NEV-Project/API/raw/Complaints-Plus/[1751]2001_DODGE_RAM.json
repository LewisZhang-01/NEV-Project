THE VEHICLE IS GARAGED OR PARKED IN THE SHADE FOR MOST OF ITS EARLY LIFE AND CRACKS AND CHUNKS HAPPENED FOR NO APPARENT REASON, BUT THIS IS PROBABLY THEIR WAY OUT OF FIXING THE PROBLEM.   NOW COMES ANOTHER PROBLEM OR INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED TO ME BECAUSE OF THIS FAULTY PLASTIC THAT WAS USED TO CONSTRUCT THE DASH.  I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND TURNED ON MY DEFROSTER AND A PIECE OF PLASTIC BLEW OUT OF THE VENT ON THE TOP OF THE DASH OR LACK THERE OF, AND HIT ME IN THE FACE CAUSING ME TO SWERVE AND ALMOST HIT AN ONCOMING CAR.  I WAS LUCKY THAT THE CAR AVOIDED ME OR IT COULD HAVE BEEN TRAGIC.  I WENT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP 2 MONTHS AGO TO HAVE SERVICE ON A DIFFERENT VEHICLE AND QUESTIONED THEM ON THE STATUS OF ANY RECALL AND THEY ASKED ME FOR MY VIN # OF MY DODGE RAM PICKUP WHICH I PROVIDED AND THEY SAID THERE IS NO RECORD OF ME TAKING THE VEHICLE TO THEM FOR A INSPECTION, WHICH IS TOTALLY FALSE!!! THEY CONVENIENTLY LOST MY RECORDS ON MY PICK UP!!!!!  SOMETHING HAS GOT TO BE DONE TO PREVENT SOMEONE FROM BEING KILLED DUE TO THIS  FAULT OF CHRYSLER CORP.

BY 2008 THE SMALL CRACKS TURNED INTO LARGE CRACKS AND THEN THE FIRST PART OVER THE RADIO AREA AS SHOWN IN PICTURE FELL IN! AT THE TIME I HAD PLACED SOME ITEMS ON THE DASH AND HAD THOUGHT THAT CAUSED IT BUT WHEN I STARTED TO CLEAN IT UP MORE STARTED TO JUST BREAK OFF SO I DIDN'T MESS WITH IT AGAIN! I CONTACTED BARRETT DODGE IN ATHENS GA A WEEK LATER AND SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE DEPORTMENT. THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS NO RECALLS AND TRUCK WAS OUT OF WARRANTY SO AT THAT TIME THERE WAS NOTHING THEY WOULD DO OTHER THAN CHARGE ME A CRAZY PRICE TO REPLACE IT FOR MY AND THEN IF A RECALL EVER DID HAPPEN THEY SAID I WOULD PROBABLY GET BACK AT LEAST HALF OF MY REPAIR COST! THAT STILL MEANT I WOULD HAVE PAID HUNDREDS FOR THE REPAIR SO I DIDN'T DO IT.     THE MAIN REASON IM LOOKING INTO THIS AGAIN NOW IN 2015 IS BECAUSE YESTERDAY MY 8 YEAR OLD SON WAS PLAYING IN THE TRUCK WHILE I WAS WORKING ON IT AND HE WENT TO GET A TOY OFF THE DASH AND HIS ARM WENT THROUGH THE DASH AND CUT HIM LEAVING ABOUT A 1 INCH LONG CUT IN HIS ARM! THIS IS NOW WHY IM NOW 7 YEARS LATER SURPRISED THAT WITH ALL THE COMPLAINTS THAT ARE ON THE INTERNET ABOUT THIS ISSUE THAT DODGE HAS NOT STEPPED UP NOR HAVE THEY BEEN MADE TO STEP UP AND HELP FIX THIS ISSUE! DOES SOMEBODY'S CHILD HAVE TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED OR GOD FORBID DIE FROM A INJURY CAUSED BY THE SHAPE PIECES OF THIS DASH BEFORE SOMETHING IS DONE ABOUT THIS!     IM NOW LOOKING INTO GETTING THIS DASH REPAIRED MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY FOR MY FAMILY! I REALLY HAVE NOT BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE COSMETIC LOOK THAT DODGE HAS BEEN HIDING BEHIND FOR THEIR REASON TO NOT FIX THIS ISSUE! BUT I WILL BE DAMMED IF IM GOING TO LET THIS POORLY DESIGNED DODGE DASH HURT MY FAMILY AGAIN!   *TR",

MY RESEARCH SUGGEST THAT CHRYSLER USED INFERIOR PRODUCTS AS A COST REDUCTION, DID NOT ACQUIRE THE PROPER MANUFACTURING TEMPERATURES WHICH RESULTS IN CRACKING, AND THE DASH IS INADEQUATELY MOUNTED CAUSING FLEXING.

DODGE HAS A HISTORY ALL THE WAY BACK TO MY FIRST PURCHASE OF A BRAND NEW 1973 DODGE RAM, IGNORING WARRANTY AND MAKING EXCUSES OF WHY THINGS AREN'T THEIR FAULT!

I TRIED TO SLOW MY VEHICLE BY BRAKING BUT MY BRAKES WERE NOT WORKING SO I JUST LET UP ON THE GAS.  AT THIS POINT MY BRAKE LIGHT CAME ON AS DID MY ABS LIGHT ON THE CONTROL PANEL.  I WAS STILL ABOUT 40 MILES AWAY FROM MY HOME AND STILL HAD ABOUT 30 MINUTES OF DRIVING TO DO BEFORE I REACHED MY DESTINATION.  I DROVE ABOUT 20 MILES AN HOUR WITH MY EMERGENCY LIGHTS ON AND WAS PREPARED TO US MY EMERGENCY BRAKE IF I NEEDED TO.  THANKFULLY THERE WAS CONSTRUCTION GOING ON AT THE TIME ON PARTS OF HIGHWAY 231 AT THE TIME, SO PARTS OF HIGHWAY 231 WERE SLOW GOING ANYWAY.  HOWEVER, THE LOSS OF MY BRAKE SYSTEM SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED.  I MADE IT SUCCESSFULLY HOME WITHOUT INJURING MYSELF OR ANYONE ELSE ON FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 17, 2010.  HOWEVER, MY TRUCK IS ONLY 9 YEARS ONLY AND THIS INCIDENT SHOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN PLACE.  WHEN I RETURNED HOME ALL OF MY BRAKE FLUID WAS PORING OUT AND WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF THE MASTER TANK UNDER MY HOOD.  FURTHERMORE, LOOKING AT THE BRAKE LINES, THE HARD LINES THAT LEAD TO THIS PROBLEM REVEALED THAT SEVERE RUST HAD LEAD TO THE TOTAL BREAKDOWN AND ACTUALLY CAUSED THE HARD LINES OF MY BRAKES TO BRAKE IN HALF, WHILE I WAS DRIVING.  THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN IN A NINE YEAR ONLY VEHICLE, THAT IS VERY WELL MAINTAINED.  I HAVE SINCE REPLACE MY BRAKE SYSTEM WITH ALL NEW PARTS AND BLEED THE BRAKE SYSTEM.  I HAVE ALSO TOLD PEOPLE WITH WHOM I NOW HAVE OTHER DODGE'S ABOUT MY INCIDENT, TO AT LEAST CHECK THEIR BRAKE SYSTEM FOR POSSIBLE RUST SO THEY DO NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHAT I HAVE GONE THROUGH.  I HAVE KEPT THE OLD PART, AT LEAST FOR A WHILE, IN CASE I NEED TO PROVE THAT THIS REALLY DID HAPPEN AND THESE WERE REALLY BAD PARTS THAT CHRYSLER INSTALLED ON THESE TRUCKS.  MOST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY THERE WERE NO RECALLS ON THIS AFTER THERE WERE SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS SAME INCIDENT. *TR",

APPROXIMATELY 6 MONTHS AFTER OWNERSHIP, I WAS DRIVING NORTH ON INTERSTATE 95 NEAR RICHMOND VA, AT ABOUT 70 MILES PER HOUR WHEN THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY.  I CAME TO A STOP, AND TOOK A STATE ROUTE THE REMAINDER OF THE TRIP, AFTER LOOKING UNDER THE VEHICLE FOR SOME OBVIOUS DEFECT. I COULD SEE NOTHING.  A FEW DAYS LATER, I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO AN ASE CERTIFIED REPAIR SHOP.  THEY NOTICED SLIGHT PLAY IN THE LEFT FRONT U JOINT, SO I HAD BOTH REPLACED, KNOWING THAT  COULD NOT HAVE POSSIBLY CAUSED WHAT I EXPERIENCED.  I DROVE THE VEHICLE ABOUT ANOTHER 6 MONTHS AND HAD THE SAME INCIDENT OCCUR.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE REPAIR SHOP AND ASKED THEM TO INSPECT THE SUSPENSION, EXPLAINING THE VIOLENT SHAKING THAT OCCURRED.  THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG.  EVERYTHING WAS FINE UNTIL 2 WEEKS AGO. AGAIN, WHILE DRIVING ON I95, AT ABOUT 70, OUT OF NOWHERE, WITHOUT WARNING, THE VEHICLE SHOOK VIOLENTLY.  IT SHOOK MY BODY SO HARD IT BLURRED MY VISION.  THE AC VENT COVERS SNAPPED OUT , MY COFFEE UP BOUNCED OUT OF A TIGHTLY SQUEEZED HOLDER, AND MY DASH BOARD TOP CRACKED INTO ABOUT 15 PIECES.  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DANGEROUS AND VIOLENT.  I CAME TO A STOP.  ONLY THEN DID THE SHAKING STOP.  I LOOKED UNDER THE VEHICLE AND ALL ROUND FOR SOMETHING OBVIOUSLY WRONG, BUT SAW NOTHING.  THAT EVENING, I GOOGLED DODGE TRUCK VIOLENTLY SHAKING AND LEARNED ABOUT THE \"DEATH WOBBLE\".  IF THE AUTHORITIES WOULD READ THE INTERNET, AND REPORTS ON THIS ISSUE, IT WOULD BE OVERWHELMING THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW IN THIS VEHICLE.  THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THERE HAS BEEN A DEATH FROM THIS PROBLEM, AS ALL 3 TIMES IT HAPPENED TO ME, ONLY LUCK ALLOWED ME TO EXIT THE TRAVEL LANES , GET IN THE BREAK DOWN LANE AND COME TO A STOP.  A SLIGHT CHANGE IN THE TRAFFIC PATTERN WOULD HAVE CAUSED A HIGH SPEED ACCIDENT, AS IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE IT IS SHAKING SO VIOLENTLY.    PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS PROBLEM. *TR",

HE CLAIMED IT WASN'T THEIR FAULT. AT THE TIME I ACCEPTED HIS LOGIC UNTIL LATELY I FOUND OUT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE.  SINCE THEN I HAVE A NEIGHBOR WITH THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE SAME YEAR TRUCK. I THEN LEARNED THAT IF YOU GO ON A COMPUTER SEARCH ENGINE AND TYPE \"DODGE DASHBOARD CRACKS\" THERE ARE NUMEROUS CHAT ROOMS AND WEBSITES SET UP JUST FOR THIS PROBLEM. YOU WILL SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM WITHOUT CHRYSLER ACKNOWLEDGING THE PROBLEM IS THEIRS. YOU DON'T SEE THIS PROBLEM IN OTHER TRUCKS. WE NEED HELP PLEASE.  MY CONCERN IS SAFETY. IT IS CRACKING SO BAD I FEEL UNSAFE DRIVING IT BECAUSE IF I HAVE A MINOR ACCIDENT AND THE PASSENGER AIRBAG DEPLOYS, IT WILL EXPLODE AND SEND SPLINTERS OF PLASTIC AT ME AND MY PASSENGERS. I CAN'T HELP BUT TO SHIVER THINKING OF SPLINTERS, PROPELLED UNDER PRESSURE, ENTERING MY EYES AND/OR NECK IN A SMALL FRONT END ACCIDENT THAT DEPLOYS THE AIRBAG. CAN YOU PICTURE THAT?

THE DEALER COST OF REPLACEMENT IS $1,000.00 - $1,200.00 EACH. THAT IS THE REASON THEY WON'T RECALL THE PROBLEM. IS IT A MONEY MAKER FOR A FAILING COMPANY?

I ALSO NOTICED UNEVEN TIRE WEAR. I WAS ADVISED BY THE DODGE DEALERSHIP THAT THE VEHICLE HAD NO DEFECTS AND TO SEEK OUT THE TIRE MANUFACTURER. IN FEBRUARY 2007 WITH APPROXIMATELY 58,400 MILES ON THE TRUCK I WAS TRAVELING THROUGH TOWN AND HEARD A CLUNKING NOISE COMING FROM MY REAR END. I LOCATED A MECHANIC THAT OPENED UP MY DIFFERENTIAL PAN AND FOUND METAL PIECES LAYING IN THE PAN. MY TRUCK HAS A LIMITED SLIP DIFFERENTIAL WITH 4:10 GEARS. THIS LAYOUT OF GEARS IS PART OF THE HEAVY DUTY OFF ROAD PACKAGE DODGE OFFERED WITH THEIR TRUCKS AT THE TIME OF MY PURCHASE. MY MECHANICS DIAGNOSIS WAS THAT THE POSI- TRACTION SPACERS HAD EXPLODED AS THEY HAD APPEARED TO HAVE STUCK TOGETHER. THE PIECES OF METAL THEN EVENTUALLY TRIED TO TRAVEL THROUGH THE RING AND GEAR CAUSING CHIPPING. THE END RESULT IS TO HAVING THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL COMPLETELY REPAIRED AT A COST WITH PARTS AND LABOR EXCEEDING $1300.00. I RECALLED BACK TO MY ORIGINAL COMPLAINT WITH DODGE OF THE EXCESSIVE TIRE SQUEALING AND UNEVEN TIRE WEAR AT 10,000 MILES AND BASED UPON MY KNOWLEDGE BELIEVE THAT THE TIRES WERE SQUEALING WHILE TURNING ONTO OTHER STREETS AS THE REAR END WAS LOCKED UP IN THE POSI TRACTION MODE. I CONTACTED DODGE SEVERAL TIMES AND SPOKE WITH THEIR CHIEF CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE BY THE NAME OF PAT.  DODGE STATED AT THE END OF EACH CONVERSATION THAT THEY COULD NOT ASSIST ME IN THIS ISSUE EVEN AFTER I ADVISED THEM OF THIS SAFETY ISSUE IN THEIR DODGE TRUCKS. I HAVE SPOKE AND LOCATED FOUR OTHER DODGE OWNERS IN MY TOWN THAT HAVE HAD TO REPAIR THEIR DODGE TRUCK REAR ENDS. AFTER OBSERVING THE METAL PIECES IN THE DIFFERENTIAL AND FROM SOME PERSONNEL EXPERIENCE FROM A PREVIOUS INCIDENT IN A FRIENDS TRUCK YEARS AGO I MADE THE FOLLOWING DETERMINATION, THE PIECES THAT EXPLODE IN THE DIFFERENTIAL WILL MAKE A CLUNKING NOICE IN THE DIFFERENTIAL.   *JB",

WHEN I BOUGHT THE TRUCK AT ANDERSON DODGE IN BLOOMFIELD HILLS, MICHIGAN, I WAS NOT INFORMED OF THE 7-YEAR/70,000 MILE WARRANTY ON THE POWER TRAIN.  I FOUND THIS OUT ONLY AFTER CONTACTING THE CHRYSLER (DODGE) WEB SITE THAT I HAD THE 7/70,000 WARRANTY.  THIS WAS TO LATE AS I HAD ALREADY TAKEN THE TRUCK TO MULTISTATE TRANSMISSION IN WATERFORD, MICHIGAN (ON M-59)((HURON STREET)).  THE DEALERSHIP ONLY INFORMED ME THAT I HAD A 3 YEAR/36 MONTH OR 36,000 MILE WARRANTY (BUMPER TO BUMPER) WARRANTY ON THE VEHICLE, WHICHEVER CAME FIRST.  MUCH TO MY SURPRISE, WHEN TRYING TO CONTACT CHRYSLER (DODGE) ON THE COMPUTER, DID I FIND OUT THAT I ACTUALLY HAD THE 7/70000 WARRANTY.  IT WAS TO LATE TO TAKE IT TO A DEALERSHIP AS MULTISTATE TRANSMISSION ON M-59 (HURON STREET) IN WATERFORD, MICHIGAN ALREADY HAD THE TRUCK AND DROPPED THE TRANS FOR REPAIRS.  RESULTS; REBUILD THE TRANS DUE TO TORQUE CONVERTER AND SENSORS.  PROBLEM WAS THAT THERE WAS A SEAL INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION THAT WAS DEFECTIVE ACCORDING TO MULTISTATE.  I HAVE ALSO HAD CONVERSATIONS VIA THE INTERNET WITH CHRIS, SR. CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE AND HE WAS NOT VERY HELPFUL.  HE EVEN ASKED FOR MY PHONE NUMBER(S) WHERE I COULD BE CONTACTED AND HE HAS NOT CONTACTED ME AS OF THIS WRITING.  I CONTINUE TO TRY TO CONTACT HIM BUT HE FAILS TO RETURN AN ANSWER FOR THE MESSAGES THAT I HAVE SENT HIM.  I HAVE THE COPIES OF ALL CONVERSATIONS VIA THE INTERNET AND CAN SEND TO YOU IF SO NEEDED.  I EVEN HAD A UNION SECRETARY FRIEND OF MINE WHO STATED THAT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS WERE MEMBERS OF THE UNION, WHICH SHE IS A SECRETARY TO SEE IF SHE COULD HELP.  SHE INFORMED ME THAT IF I HAD TAKEN THE TRUCK TO A CHRYSLER (DODGE) DEALERSHIP, THAT THEY WOULD HAVE POSSIBLY PAID FOR HALF OF THE REPAIRS.",

I WILL REPORT THIS ACCIDENT ON A SEPARATE QUESTIONAIRE.  THE REPORT WE GOT BACK FROM DODGE WAS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE FIRST ONE WHICH MAKES US WONDER HOW THOUROUGH AN INVESTIGATION THEY PERFORM.

THE HIGHWAY PATROL AT THE ACCIDENT HAVE TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NO TRAVEL FOR OUR TRUCK IN THE DIRECTION OF THE CAR IT HIT.

I STRESS LOOKING AT IT BECAUSE THAT IS ALL HE DID BESIDES TAKING PICTURES OF IT. HE NEVER REMOVED ANY COMPONENT.
