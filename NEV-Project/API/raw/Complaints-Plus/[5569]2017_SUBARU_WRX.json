GILES SUBARU ALSO EXTENDS THE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY TO LIFETIME IF YOU PROVE PROPER OIL CHANGES AND GO IN FOR AN INSPECTION EVERY TWO YEARS. DENIED MY CLAIM FOR NOT COMING FOR TWO YEAR INSPECTION. SUBARU RATED MY 2.0 TURBOCHARGED ENGINE AT 268 HORSEPOWER WITH THE 15.9 PSI OF BOOST. RESEARCH VERIFIED ITS THE ONLY CAR SUBARU USES THIS ENGINE IN. SUBARU'S CROSSTREK USES THIS 2.0 BUT AS A NON TURBOCHARGED ENGINE RATED AT 152 HP. NO OTHER CAR IN SUBARU'S LINE UP HAS THAT MUCH HORSEPOWER RATED PER LITER. RESEARCH SHOWS SUBARU ADDED A TURBOCHARGER TO THEIR 152 HORSEPOWER ENGINE BUT DID NOT UPGRADE THE LUBRICATION SYSTEM TO HANDLE THE HIGHER STRESSES. SUBARU HAS LUBRICATION PROBLEMS WITH OTHER ENGINES AND HAS THREE CLASS ACTION SUITS NOW. I SEEN MY AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS WARRANTY WAS INCREASED BY SUBARU RECENTLY AND DEMANDED BY A COURT TO COVER REPAIRS PAST AND FUTURE UNTIL 100,000 MILE WARRANTY. NOT THAT THEY'LL ACTUALLY PAY FOR IT IF IT BREAKS OR ANYTHING. THEY'LL SAY YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG. SHOULDN'T THIS BE ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE?
