BUT THEN IT WENT COMPLETELY OUT CAUSING A ROAD HAZARD AND UNSAFE TO DRIVE AS LIGHTS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. IT ALSO HAS CAUSED ME TO BE PULLED OVER BY MANY POLICE WHEN I SHOULDN'T BE GOING THROUGH THIS OR ANYONE'S ONE ELSE THAT IS GOING THROUGH THE SAME PROBLEM WITH KIA. THIS FIRST OCCURRED WHEN I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY COULD'VE BEEN A BAD SITUATION. IT COULD BE A BAD WIRING AS I READ FROM OTHER REPORTS BUT KIA HAS NOT DONE A RECALL. THIS SITUATION SHOULD BE COVERED BY KIA AND NO ONE SHOULD PAY AS IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND ACCIDENTS COULD OCCUR",
