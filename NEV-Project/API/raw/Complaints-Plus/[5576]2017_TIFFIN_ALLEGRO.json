I see both F numbers in my documents.  Subject: Instrument panel lights  When driving this vehicle in good weather, sun or partly cloud day, I cannot see anything in the Instrument Cluster.  This is quite difficult, dangerous, primarily as I cannot tell my speed  much less the other instrument readings.  I have the parking lights turned on and the Dimmer switch in the full upright position for maximum illumination.  What can be done to correct this issue?
