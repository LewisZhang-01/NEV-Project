THESE TIRES SHOULD HAVE MANY MORE YEARS OF LIFE IN THEM AND DO NOT HAVE VERY MANY MILES ON THEM.   I WOULD APPRECIATE MICHELIN REPLACING THESE TIRES ..  THESE TIRES HAVE A 70,000 MILE WARRANTY ON THEM HOWEVER THEY ARE NOW 6 YEARS OLD, AND JUST PAST THE MICHELIN WARRANTY DATE.   I WAS TOLD BY NTB MANAGER THAT MICHELIN HAVE A TENDENCY TO DRY-ROT/ CRACK AND HE EVEN HAD THIS HAPPEN TO ONES ON HIS CAR.   THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD.   NEW TIRES WILL COST OVER $800 ON THIS VEHICLE.

NO AIR BAGS DEPLOYED, WHICH REALLY UPSET ME! THE REAR HATCH LOOKED LIKE SOMEONE HAD OPENED IT THEN SHUT IT WITH A LIGHT POLE LAYING ACROSS IT.

IT STARTED AS THE POWER DOOR WOULD OCCASIONALLY PULL ITSELF IN THE WRONG DIRECTION WHEN OPENED OR CLOSED RESULTING IN THE MOTOR MAKING NOISES THEN IT WOULD BEEP. LATER IT STARTED OPENING BUT NOT MAKING IT TO ITS LATCHED POSITION. TOOK IT IN HAD THE MOTOR REPLACED. THEN ABOUT A YEAR LATER IT DIED. JUST DIED.. NO POWER WHAT SO EVER. TOOK IT IN AND THEY REPLACED THE MOTOR AGAIN AND THE LATCH RELEASE. 2 YEARS WENT BY JUST FINE THEN WE LOST THE LATCH RELEASE. SO THE DOOR WOULD OPEN OR CLOSE BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO PULL THE HANDLE OR ELSE IT WOULD GET CAUGHT. TOOK IT IN A 3RD TIME AND THEY REPLACED LATCH RELEASE ON BOTH SIDES. NO MORE ISSUES. UNTIL NOW. ABOUT 4 DAYS AGO THE AUTO LATCH RELEASE DIED ON THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR. YESTERDAY I WENT TO GO GET SOMETHING FROM THE STORE AND AS I WAS WAITING IN THE PARKING LOT I TRIED TO TEST HE PASSENGER SIDE DOOR. PRESSED THE BUTTON THE AUTO RELEASE OPENED. BUT THE MOTOR SOUNDED REALLY SLOW. THEN I PRESS THE BUTTON TO CLOSE IT. AND THEN AUTO RELEASE DIED ON THAT SIDE TOO. NO SOUND JUST STOPPED WORKING. THIS IS THE 4TH TIME WE ARE TAKING IT IN FOR THE POWER DOOR TO BE FIXED. I DID SOME RESEARCH ON YOUTUBE AND GOOGLE AND FOUND THAT MANY OTHER 06 SEDONA DRIVERS HAVE HAD THESE ISSUES.

THE SECOND PROBLEM IS A STEERING WHEEL VIBRATION THAT WE HAVE HAS BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE WE PURCHASED THE VAN.

THE SECOND REPAIR ATTEMPT, THE DEALER CLAIMED THAT THEY INSTALLED SOP REAR HATCH WEATHERSTRIP DUE TO DEFORMATION.  AGAIN THE LEAK PRESISTED AND THE CARGO AREA WAS FLOODED LATER.  THE THIRD ATTEMPT, THE KIA DEALER FOUND THAT THE REAR HATCH SEAL WAS NOT INSTALLED CORRECTLY, AND THEY CLAIMED THAT THEY CLEANED, RESEALED, AND RECHECKED AND NO LEAK.

I GOT IN MY VEHICLE AND DROVE TO A NEARBY PARKING LOT TO MOVE MY CHILD'S CAR SEAT TO THE OTHER SIDE.  I CONTACTED MY DEALERSHIP TO LET THEM KNOW I WAS ON MY WAY AND GAVE AN EXPLANATION OF THE ISSUE.

I EXPRESSED MY DISAPPOINTMENT AND TOLD HIM I WOULD BE COMING NOW TO THE DEALERSHIP AS SOON AS I COULD GET THERE.  THE DOOR CONTINUED TO OPEN THROUGHOUT MY 30 MINUTE DRIVE TO THE NEAREST KIA DEALERSHIP, LEAVING ME TO PULL OVER AND, AGAIN, MANUALLY TRY TO CLOSE THE DOOR.  THIS OCCURRED 6 TIMES.  ON PULLING INTO THE DEALERSHIP PARKING LOT, WHICH IS DOWN A SMALL HILL, THE DOOR AGAIN SLID OPEN AND CLOSED.

THE PART WAS REPLACED AND I PAID OUT OF POCKET FOR THE EXPENSES, AS MY LIMITED WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED.

ON 3/9 THE PASSENGER SLIDING DOOR FLEW OPEN WHEN I MADE A SHARP TURN WHILE MY SONS WERE SITTING IN THE MIDDLE SEATS. I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A FLUKE BUT ON 3/12 AS I WAS DRIVING DURING RUSH HOUR ON THE HIGH WAY AND HIT A BUMP, THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR FLEW OPEN WHILE MY SON WAS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE SEAT. I FREAKED OUT COMPLETELY AT THE HORROR OF IT AND THEN PULLED OVER, SHUT THE DOOR, AND HELD IT AS I DROVE STRAIGHT TO MY KIA DEALER. I WAS RELIEVED THE NIGHTMARE WAS OVER AND THAT WE MADE IT SAFELY UNTIL I WAS TOLD THAT MY WARRANTY EXPIRED AT 60,000 MILES (I AM AT 71,000) AND THAT IT WOULD COST ME 423.67$ TO HAVE MY VAN SAFE FOR MY CHILDREN AGAIN. I EXPRESSED MY ANGER TO THE SERVICE MANAGER WHO EXPLAINED THAT HIS HANDS WERE TIED BY THE WARRANTY. I TRIED TO CALL KIA CUSTOMER SERVICE BUT IT WAS CLOSED. I AM ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGED THAT INSTEAD OF BEING GRATEFUL THAT WE MADE IT SAFELY AND THAT I AM NOT SUING KIA IF THE UNTHINKABLE HAD HAPPENED, THAT KIA HAS TAKEN THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE ME TO FIX THEIR MISTAKE. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE LATCH IS FAULTY BECAUSE LATCHES DON'T JUST WEAR AFTER 3 YEARS, AND THE MILEAGE ON THE VEHICLE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WEAR AND TEAR OF THE LATCH. IT IS A CHEAP AND FAULTY LATCH, AND KIA MADE ME PAY FOR THEIR INCOMPETENCE. FURTHERMORE, I JUST CO-SIGNED FOR MY SON TO BUY HIS 1ST NEW VEHICLE FROM THIS SAME KIA DEALERSHIP AND I AM NOW HOPING AGAINST HOPE THAT I DIDN'T SIGN HIM INTO A DEATH TRAP! IT IS ABSOLUTELY ABSURD THAT A CUSTOMER WITH A BARELY OVER 3-YEAR-OLD VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE THIS ISSUE.

THE BRAKE SYSTEM HAS TWO FLAWS:    1.THE BRAKES MAKE A LOUD SQUEALING NOISE WHEN BACKING, ESPECIALLY DOWN A HILL OR STEEP GRADE. THIS SITUATION WAS ADDRESSED ON FOUR SEPARATE VISITS TO THE KIA SERVICE CENTER IN 2007. THOSE DATES WERE SEPTEMBER 20, OCTOBER 26, NOVEMBER 17 AND DECEMBER 13. EACH TIME, THE SERVICE CENTER STATED THAT THIS IS 'NORMAL NOISE ASSOCIATED WITH SEMI METALLIC BRAKE PADS'.    THE SERVICE CENTER DID RESURFACE THE PADS ON THE OCTOBER 26, 2007 VISIT. THE SQUEALING WAS CORRECTED FOR A SHORT TIME, AND THEN RETURNED. IT IS STILL PRESENT TO THIS DAY (JULY 10, 2008).    I HAVE NEVER OWNED A VEHICLE THAT CONSTANTLY HAS 'NORMAL' BRAKE NOISE AS STATED BY THE KIA SERVICE CENTER. THIS VEHICLE IS ONLY TWO YEARS OLD AND WAS PURCHASED ON MAY 22, 2006.    2. WHEN DECELERATING AND COMING TO A STOP, THE BRAKES WILL SUDDENLY LOSE CAPTURE FOR A SHORT MOMENT. THE PEDAL MUST BE PRESSED HARDER AT THAT POINT TO CONTINUE STOPPING. THIS SITUATION WAS ADDRESSED AT THE KIA SERVICE CENTER ON DECEMBER 13, 2007. THE SERVICE CENTER TECHNICIANS STATED THEY WERE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND NO REPAIRS WERE ATTEMPTED.    WE SENT A LETTER TO KIA CONSUMER AFFAIRS ON NOVEMBER 20, 2007. A KIA REPRESENTATIVE DID CONTACT US TO ADVISE THAT THEY WOULD NOT ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS ANY FURTHER.

DURING THE FIRST OCCASION THE LIGHT WAS RESET AS THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN COULD NOT FIND A PROBLEM.  ON THE SECOND OCCASION A CODE APPEARED, BUT NO PARTS WERE ORDERED SINCE THE CODE COULD NOT BE DIAGNOSED.  THE LIGHT WAS AGAIN RESET, AND THE VAN SENT BACK TO ME.  ON THE THIRD OCCASION TWO CODES APPEARED, PART WERE ORDERED, BUT IT WAS STILL UNCLEAR OF THE PROBLEM.  AGAIN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT RESET THE AIR BAG LIGHT AND SAID THEY WOULD CALL WHEN THE PARTS ARRIVED.  AFTER NOT HEARING FROM ANYONE, I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP TAYLOR KIA, AND THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE SORRY FOR NOT CONTACTING ME, AND I COULD BRING THE VAN IN ON JANUARY 18, 2007. ON THAT OCCASION, A PART WAS REPLACED, A LEG ASSEMBLY.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE LIGHT ISSUE SHOULD BE FIXED. ON MAY 10, 2007, MY WIFE WAS DRIVING WITH MY 15 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT. THEY WERE HIT IN THE DRIVER SIDE BY A VEHICLE TRAVELING ABOUT 50 MPH.  THE FRONT DRIVER, AND PASSENGER AIR BAGS DEPLOYED.   THE SIDE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY, AND UPON IMPACT THE SEAT BELTS RELEASED, INSTEAD OF LOCKING, WITH NO RETRACTION.  THIS CAUSE MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER TO BE THROWN AROUND IN THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE.  ACCORDING TO THE VAN'S MANUAL, THE AIR BAGS, AND SEAT BELTS SHOULD WORK TOGETHER.  THE FACT THAT THE SEAT BELTS RELEASED COULD HAVE ALLOWED FOR EITHER THE DRIVER OR THE PASSENGER TO BE EJECTED.
