THE CONTACT DID NOT KNOW WHO MANUFACTURED THE TIRES AND COULD NOT FIND OUT BEFORE SHE CALLED NHTSA.  EACH OF THE TIRES HAD A BLOW OUT BETWEEN THE SUMMER OF 2006 AND EARLY 2007.  ON JUNE 24, 2007, SHE PURCHASED TEN NEW DEE STONE TIRES (DOT NUMBERS 2B/0807/A-06, DOT2B/1207/A-06, DOT2B/4206/A-06, DOT2B3906/A-06, DOT2B/4206/A-06, DOT2B/4806/A-06, DOT2B/1207/A-06, DOT2B/4806/A-06, DOT2B/3906/A-06, AND DOT2B/4306/A-06).  THE CONTACT LATER DISCOVERED THAT ALL TEN TIRES HAD TREAD SEPARATION AND SPLITS IN THE GROOVE, WHICH WERE LARGE ENOUGH TO FIT A QUARTER.  PRIOR TO PURCHASING THE TEN ADDITIONAL TIRES, SHE HAD THE AXLE AND SPRINGS REPLACED ON HER TRAILER BECAUSE THE MECHANIC BELIEVED THAT THEY CAUSED THE FIRST EIGHT TIRES TO FAIL.  THE CONTACT WAS REIMBURSED FOR THE FINAL TEN TIRES BECAUSE THE BLADE THAT MADE THE ZIG ZAG PATTERN ON THE TIRES, PUNCTURED THE TREAD.  SHE STATED THAT THE TIRES ARE CALLED FOURTEEN FIVES FOR TRACTOR TRAILERS AND HEAVY EQUIPMENT.  NO VEHICLE INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE.",
