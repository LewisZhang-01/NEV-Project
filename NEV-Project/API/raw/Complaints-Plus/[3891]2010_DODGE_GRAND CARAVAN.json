While driving dinging noise can be heard all gages go crazy and all lights come on from dashboard. This has occurred many times, my biggest fear is causing an accident while my children are with me. Van was taken in for service at local dealership, after a week I was told that there was  no issue with the van. The frustrating part is this problem is not constant, and I can go weeks without any problems. Two days after pick from dealership problems started up again. Maybe a second trip to the dealership will give me some answers. I shouldn't be afraid to drive my van, but every time I get behind the wheel that is what if feel.

WELL THE SAME PROBLEMS OCCURED A FEW MORE TIMES WITH NO COMMON DENOMINATOR AS TO WHY IT WAS NOT RUNNING. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE CHRYSLER DEALER AND THEY UNPLUGGED THE TIPM (TOTAL INTEGRATED POWER MODULE). THEY SAID THAT CLEARED ALL CODES AND A RESET FIXES THE PROBLEM SOME TIMES.

I ALMOST TOO OUT MY FENCE WHEN THIS HAPPENED. I PUT IT IN PARK AND THE KEY WOULDN'T COME OUT. AFTER A LITTLE WHILE THE KEY CAME OUT ANBD THE VAN FINALLY STARTED. I CALLED THE TOW TRUCK AND HAD IT HAULED DIRECTLY TO THE DEALER. AFTER A FEW DAYS THE DETERMINED IT WAS HE TIPM AND THE BILL WAS APP. $1000.00.

I TOOK IT IN TO OUR LOCAL DODGE DEALER AND THEY PERFORMED THE RECALL FOR US.    WITHIN A FEW DAYS, THE EXACT SAME THING WAS HAPPENING. SO WE TOOK IT BACK. THE SAME DEALER DID THE FOLLOWING:  -CLEARED THE COMPUTER CODES TO HAVE A CLEAN CAPTURE  -UPDATED OUR PCM, APPARENTLY THERE WAS AN FLASH UPGRADE.    WE DROVE IT OVER THE WEEKEND, THINGS SEEMED FINE. BUT THEN, IT DID IT AGAIN. TWICE IN THE SPAN OF ABOUT 20 MINUTES.    I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER TO SEE WHAT THE CODES WERE.    NOW THEY HAVE DETERMINED:  -THE TPIM IS THE PROBLEM  -AND THE INVERTER IS THROWING CODES TOO, SO THAT PROBABLY NEEDS REPLACED.    I PAID THEM FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC AND TOLD THEM I'M GOING TO SIT ON THIS PENDING $1500 REPAIR.

I WAS LUCKY TO KNOW THIS PARTICULAR PART OF THE BRONX, SO WE IMMEDIATELY GOT OFF OF THE HIGHWAY AND STOPPED AT A LOCAL GARAGE.  THINKING THAT IT WAS JUST A SLOW LEAK, WE PULLED OVER TO THE PAY-FOR-AIR KIOSK AND I WENT TO FILL THE FRONT, PASSENGERS SIDE TIRE, WHICH APPEARED LOW.  THE TIRE WAS NOT FLAT, JUST LOW.    TO MAY COMPLETE AMAZEMENT, WHEN I APPLIED THE REQUIRED PRESSURE ONTO THE VALVE STEM WITH THE TIRE INFLATOR, THE VALVE STEM DISAPPEARED INTO THE RIM!  THIS IMMEDIATELY DEFLATED THE TIRE.  THE KIDS IMMEDIATELY STARTED COMPLAINING THAT THIS WAS GOING TO RUIN THE BEACH TRIP, BUT I ASSURED THEM THAT SINCE THE GAS STATION WE WERE LUCKILY DISABLED IN FRONT OF WOULD BE OF IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.    I ENTERED THE GARAGE AND FOUND THE SOLE MECHANIC TURNED WITH HIS BACK TO ME, WORKING ON A VEHICLE.  HE DIDNT SEE US COME IN AND DIDNT KNOW I WAS THERE UNTIL I EXCUSED MYSELF AND TOLD HIM ABOUT THIS CRAZY THING THAT HAD JUST HAPPENED TO ME.    LET ME GUESS, ITS A CHRYSLER, RIGHT?   TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT, HE TOLD ME THAT THE THREADS ON THE CHRYSLER/DODGE VALVE STEMS ARE MADE OF SUCH SHODDY MATERIALS THAT THEY, IN HIS WORDS, TURN TO DUST. WHEN HE FINALLY GOT THE VALVE STEM OUT OF MY TIRE, IT WAS INDEED NEARLY COMPLETELY OXIDIZED.  THE NEXT DAY, I BROUGHT THE VAN TO OUR LOCAL TIRE REPAIR SHOP TO HAVE ALL OF THE VALVES REPLACED WITH GOOD, OLD FASHIONED RUBBER ONES.  THE REMAINING WERE ALL IN SIMILAR, TERRIBLE CONDITION.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE AFTERMARKET SENSOR WE HAD PURCHASED LAST YEAR.    THE TIRE SHOP SAID THAT IT WAS A COMMON OCCURRENCE AMONG DODGE AND CHRYSLER VEHICLES.    I FEEL THIS SAME CONDITION CAUSED THE BLOWOUT WE HAD EXPERIENCED THE YEAR BEFORE AS WELL.",

WHEN I APPLIED THE TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE, THE THREADED PART OF MY TPMS VALVE STEM CRACKED AND TIRE DEFLATED IN LESS THAN ONE MINUTE.         *** INCIDENT 2 (1/12/15) ***     MY REAR TIRE WAS FOUND FLAT IN MY DRIVEWAY.  WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO INFLATE THE TIRE THE THREADED PART OF MY TPMS VALVE STEM BROKE OFF IN MY HAND.  THE TIRE HAD NO DEFECT.  THE VALVE STEM WAS THE LONE CAUSE OF THE DEFLATION.       *** INCIDENT 3 (9/4/15) ***    WHILE DRIVING 74 MPH THE LOW TIRE PRESSURE TROUBLE LIGHT CAME ON.  I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OFF THE ROAD.  MY TIRES DID NOT VISUALLY APPEAR TO BE LOW ON AIR.  DUE TO TRAFFIC NOISE I COULD NOT HEAR THE HISSING NOISE DESCRIBED IN INCIDENT ONE.  I STARTED TO CHECK THE PRESSURE OF MY TIRES.  WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE THE PLASTIC VALVE STEM CAP THE THREADED PART OF THE VALVE STEM BROKE OFF.  THE TIRE DEFLATED IN ROUGHLY 30 SECONDS.    I FEAR THE DANGER PRESENTED BY A RAPID DEFLATION AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  WE WERE FORTUNATE DURING OUR MOST RECENT INCIDENT, BUT I HAVE ONE MORE ORIGINAL TPMS VALVE STEM.  I AM NOT SURE WHICH ONE IS STILL THE ORIGINAL DUE TO THE MANY TIRE ROTATIONS WE HAVE HAD SINCE OCTOBER 2012.",

THINKING THAT THIS COULD POSSIBLY BE RELATED IN SOME WAY TO THE RECALL, I CAREFULLY READ THE DOCUMENT THAT STATED  THIS COULD CAUSE UNINTENDED ENGINE SHUT OFF AND INCREASE THE RISK OF A CRASH.    THE DOCUMENT SAID NOTHING ABOUT PROBLEMS INITIALLY STARTING THE VAN.    ON TUESDAY, AUGUST 4, AS THE VAN WOULD ONLY INTERMITTENTLY START, I BROUGHT THE VAN TO A LOCAL REPAIR SHOP. THE LOCAL REPAIR SHOP DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A DEFECTIVE STARTER.  AFTER THEY INSTALLED THE STARTER, THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD THEN DONE SOME RESEARCH AND THAT THERE WAS A RECALL OUT FOR THIS PROBLEM.  THEY STILL CHARGED ME $390.00.   I DROPPED OFF THE VAN THIS MORNING WITH THREE CHRYSLER KEY FOBS, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS A FREQUENCY OPERATED BUTTON IGNITION KEY OR FOBIK, AND AN ADDITIONAL AFTERMARKET KEY FOB MADE BY ILCO, WHICH PERFORMS THE SAME FUNCTIONS AS THE OEM KEY FOBS DO.  THE PEOPLE AT LARCHMONT CHRYSLER JEEP DODGE RAM STATED THAT THIS RECALL ONLY WOULD REPLACE OEM CHRYSLER KEY FOBS.    1)WHY DOES IT TAKE THREE MONTHS TO SET UP A DATE FOR A SAFETY RECALL?  2)WHY DID THE NOTICE NOT MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT IGNITION PROBLEMS BUT ONLY UNINTENDED ENGINE SHUTOFF? THE WAY THIS NOTICE IS WRITTEN, MOST PEOPLE  WOULD INFER THAT THE ENGINE WOULD ALREADY BE ON AND ONE WOULD BE DRIVING TO EXPERIENCE THIS DIFFICULTY.   3)WHY, WHEN A LOCAL VAN WAS BROUGHT TO A LOCAL REPAIR SHOP, DIDNT THIS DIAGNOSTIC CODE IMMEDIATELY MENTION THE RECALL AND STATE THAT THE RECALL PART IS THE PROBLEM, NOT THE $390 STARTER?  4)WHY, IF A PERSON HAS GONE THROUGH THE RIDICULOUS EXPENSE AND BOTHER OF GETTING FOUR KEY FOBS WHICH ALL FUNCTION, AND THAT IT IS CHRYSLERS FAULT ENTIRELY FOR THE PROBLEM, CANT AN ADDITIONAL KEY FOB BE PROVIDED?",

KEEP IN MIND I HAVE MY 3 KIDS WITH ME, AGES 8,9 AND 10. I TURNED BACK AROUND AFTER DRIVING OVER 40 MILES, USING ONLY MY FOG LIGHTS THAT PROVIDE 40-50 FEET OF VISIBILITY. I CAUTIOUSLY DRIVE HOME ALMOST IN THE DARK, MADE IT HOME AND GOOGLED THIS PROBLEM. LOOKS LIKE A TIPM ISSUE FROM WHAT I GATHERED. SO IN THE MORNING MY VEHICLE DOESN'T START. I CALLED MY LOCAL DODGE DEALER, THEY AREN'T AWARE OF A RECALL ON THIS AND HAS NEVER HEARD THIS BEFORE. ADDITIONALLY THEY WANT $110 TO TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY VEHICLE. SO I HAD MY VEHICLE TOWED TO MARTIN SWANTY HYUNDAI TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM FOR FREE, AND I SPENT $111 ON WHAT THEY SAID WAS A BAD POSITIVE BATTERY TERMINAL CONNECTION. WELL, GOT IT HOME, THE HEADLIGHTS WORKED AGAIN. NEXT DAY, IT'S NIGHT TIME AGAIN AND GUESS WHAT, NO HEADLIGHTS AGAIN! LOOKS LIKE IT WASN'T THE BATTERY CONNECTION, STILL HAVING THE FAMOUS TIPM M.O. THIS IS CLEARLY NOT THE FIRST VEHICLE TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM. I SEE THIS IS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT THAT DODGE AND CHRYSLER ARE SWEEPING UNDER THE RUG. SO NOW I HAVE A FAMILY OF 5 (SOON TO BE 6) TO SUPPORT, AND DRIVE AROUND IN MY FAMILY VEHICLE WITH NO HEADLIGHTS AND THIS IS NOT A RECALL YET WITH DODGE? AND YOU WANT ME TO SPEND OVER $1000 TO GET IT FIXED JUST TO PUT ANOTHER FAULTY PART IN MY VAN AGAIN? I HAVE MY FAMILY TO FEED, NOT $1000 TO FEED INTO MY CAR THAT'S ONLY 5 YEARS OLD AND PAID OFF. I WAS TOLD BY MY LOCAL DODGE DEALER TO CALL CHRYSLER AT 1-800-334-9200 AND SPOKE WITH A REPRESENTATIVE THAT SAID THAT THEY WILL NOT OFFER A COMPLEMENTARY DIAGNOSIS, I WOULD NEED TO PAY ANOTHER $110 TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT TO DIAGNOSE WHAT IS WRONG. I ASKED THEM IF THEY WERE FAMILIAR WITH THIS ISSUE AND THEY SAID THEY WERE NOT.   *TR",

THIS IS THE SECOND TEMPERATURE SENSOR THAT HAS BEEN REPLACED BY THE DEALER.  INTERNET SEARCH CONFIRMS MANY ISSUES SUCH AS THIS ARE EVIDENT ON THE ROAD.

THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS FUSSY AND INCONSISTENT, BUT FUNCTIONAL MORE OR LESS. AFTER ARRIVING AT FAMILY MEMBER'S HOUSE IN CA., NEVER USED CRUISE CONTROL WHILE DRIVING BECAUSE OF WINDY ROADS. ON TUESDAY, JUNE 17TH, 2014 (DURING OUR TRIP) , I WAS HEADING EAST ON HWY. 12, WEST OF LODI, CA. THERE WAS A LONG MERGE LANE, AND I WAS ACCELERATING IN TO TRAFFIC. I WAS NOT USING CRUISE CONTROL. AS I PULLED ON TO THE HIGHWAY, THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WENT OUT FROM UNDER MY FOOT AND STUCK TO THE FLOOR. I PUT BOTH FEET ON THE BRAKE, AND THE ENGINE WAS ROARING, RED-LINED. I REMEMBERED HEARING ON THE NEWS TO PUT THE VEHICLE IN NEUTRAL, WHICH I DID. THE BRAKES WORKED, AND I PULLED OVER ON THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY. THE MOTOR WAS STILL REVVING, SO I THEN TURNED OFF THE ENGINE. AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES OF CONVERSATION WITH FAMILY  (AND PRAYERS OF THANKS!!!), WE CONTINUED ON OUR WAY. ON THURSDAY, JUNE 19TH, I TOOK THE VAN TO A DODGE DEALER IN FOLSOM, CA. TO HAVE THE VEHICLE DIAGNOSED. MILEAGE WAS AT 4308 IN FOLSOM, SO VEHICLE WAS BASICALLY NEW, BUT OFF WARRANTY. THE ONLY THING THEY FOUND WAS A TRANSMISSION CODE FOR OVERHEATING 6 STARTS AGO. THEY SAID EVERYTHING CHECKED OUT FINE.

WHEN THIS OCCURS SOMETIMES CAR WILL RESTART IF YOU SLIGHTLY TURN THE KEY TOWARDS START QUICK ENOUGH, OTHERWISE YOU HAVE TO SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL TO HAVE SOME CONTROL AND THEN TURN THE KEY TO RESTART (NOT FUN OR SAFE IN TRAFFIC AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS).  THIS CAN HAPPEN WHILE SITTING IN THE DRIVEWAY BEFORE MOVING OR AT ANY SPEED, BUMPY ROADS ESPECIALLY BAD. ONCE WE REALIZED WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE IGNITION SWITCH/KEY I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THE RECALL 11V-139 AND DETERMINED THAT OUR VAN WAS BUILT DURING THE RECALL MANUFACTURE DATES.  CALLED DODGE 3 TIMES, FIRST TWO CALLS WAS TOLD RECALL DID NOT EXIST.  ON THE 3RD CALL WAS TOLD IT DID EXIST BUT MY VIN WAS NOT INCLUDED IN RECALL.  I ASKED TO AT LEAST HAVE THE IGNITION SCANNED WITH THE WITECH SCAN TOOL (AS DESCRIBED IN THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE L25 RECALL NOTICE SENT TO DEALERS) DEALER TO DETERMINE IF IT WAS A MARQUARDT, SIEMENS OR CONTINENTAL WIN MODULE.  I WAS TOLD I COULD DO THIS AT MY EXPENSE BUT EVEN IF THE RESULTS SHOWED IT WAS A RECALLED IGNITION IT WOULD NOT BE COVERED SINCE MY VIN WAS NOT IN THE RECALL.

FINALLY I HEARD A GROANING SOUND MYSELF. THE REAR WHEELS WERE VERY HOT COMPARED TO THE FRONT. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER WE BOUGHT IT FROM. HE TOLD ME HE HAS SEEN MANY OF THESE VEHICLES COME IN WITH THE SAME ISSUE. THE VEHICLE ONLY HAS 19000 MILES ON IT SO I THOUGHT IT WAS A WARRANTY ISSUE. HE TOLD ME THE BRAKE SYSTEM IS ONLY WARRANTED FOR 12000 MILES. HE TOLD ME IT WILL COST ME ABOUT $365.00 TO CHANGE ALL THE PARTS. I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH CHRYSLER/ DODGE AND THEY ARE ONLY GIVING ME $150.00. OBVIOUSLY THEY KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLES OR WHY WOULD THEY BE GIVING ME ANY CREDIT AT ALL IF THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY? THEY TOLD ME THE CALIPERS LOCKED UP AND THAT WAS THE PROBLEM. I WORK WITH 2 OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE SAME VEHICLE AND HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. ONE DEALERSHIP CHANGED THE ROTORS, PADS, AND CALIPERS FOR HIM 3 TIMES AT NO CHARGE!! IT HAPPENS ON HIS VEHICLE ABOUT EVERY 10000 MILES. THE OTHER OWNER HAS THE SAME DEALER I HAVE AND WAS GIVEN THE SAME LINE I WAS. HE WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE IF MY WIFE IS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AT 65 MILES PER HOUR AND THE REAR BRAKES LOCK UP!! YOU BETTER BELIEVE THERE WILL BE A MEGA-LAWSUIT!! HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE? THIS NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT UP ON THE NATIONAL NEWS AND PEOPLE NEED TO BE AWARE OF IT BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED OR INJURED FROM THE BRAKES LOCKING UP.

THE CAR KILLED AGAIN FOR THE THIRD TIME OF US, AND BARELY MISSED HAVING AN ACCIDENT. THEY TOLD US THAT IT WAS ONE OF TWO PARTS AND THEY HAD ONLY REPLACED ONE PREVIOUSLY. WHEN ASKED WHY THEY TOLD US THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR PARTS IF TURNED THEM INTO GMAC AND THEY WERE GOOD.
