SMOKE STARTED TO COME OUT OF THE ENGINE AND IT STOPPED COMPLETELY.  IT WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE IMPELLER BROKE, CAUSING THE WATER PUMP TO FAIL AND THE ENGINE TO OVERHEAT AND MELT INSIDE.  THE ENGINE IS NOW USELESS.  THE CAR IS SITTING AT THE DEALERSHIP IN PARTS.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT IT IS WORTHLESS NOW AND THAT EVEN A REBUILT ENGINE COSTS MORE THAN THE CAR IS WORTH.  THE ENGINE DID NOT SHOW THAT IT WAS HOT (HOWEVER, THIS IS  ON THE SAME INSTRUMENT PANEL AS THE MALFUNCTIONING ODOMOETER/SPEEDOMETER).  THERE WAS NO WARNING WHATSOEVER.  IT IS UNSAFE FOR ENGINES TO SUDDENLY MELT WHILE ONE IS DRIVING.  THE CAR HAS HAD ALL REGULAR MAINTENANCE AND RECALLS.  THIS IS INEXCUSABLE FOR A CAR THIS AGE.  THE $3,600 PROPERTY DAMAGE EXTIMATE IS MY ESTIMATE OF THE VALUE OF THE CAR.  I SEE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL PREVIOUS COMPLAINTS TO NHTSA REGARDING THE SAME PROBLEM.  IS FORD FIXING THIS OR NOT?  CONTOUR OWNERS SHOULD BE MADE AWARE THAT THEIR ENGINES MAY SUDDENLY MELT, OR THE IMPELLERS SHOULD BE RECALLED AND REPLACED.
