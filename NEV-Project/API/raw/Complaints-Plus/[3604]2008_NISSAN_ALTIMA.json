CHECK ENGINE LIGHT REMAINS ON EVEN AFTER BEING CLEARED WILL  THROW THE SAME P024 ERROR CODE. I JUST BOUGHT THIS CAR BOUGHT AND AM UNABLE TO SAFELY DRIVE IT WITHOUT A DEADLY OUTCOME.",

MY VEHICLE WAS MANUFACTURED ONE MONTH AFTER THE LAST MONTH INCLUDED IN THIS RECALL, BUT THE PASSENGER SEAT AIR BAG SENSOR WAS MANUFACTURED DURING THE LAST MONTH OF PRODUCTION INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  THE PROBLEMS WITH THE PASSENGER AIR BAG WARNINGS GO BEYOND THE ORIGINAL RECALL.  THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE THAT I BELIEVE WARRANTS EXPANSION OF THE ABOVE RECALL OR A NEW RECALL.  I DON'T BELIEVE NISSAN IS LIVING UP TO ITS SAFETY RESPONSIBILITIES.  I HAVE COMPLETED SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH INTO THIS ISSUE (SEE ATTACHMENT) THAT SHOULD CONVINCE NHTSA OF THE NEED FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THIS DEFECT.  I HAVE INVESTED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME IN RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE AND CREATING THE ATTACHED REPORT.  I WOULD APPRECIATE A RESPONSE FROM NHTSA STATING IF THEY INTEND TO PURSUE NISSAN TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL RECALLS, OR NOT.",

I HAVE RESEARCHED AND FOUND THAT ALL THREE OF THE PROBLEMS I HAVE ARE KNOWN PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY REPORTED TO NISSAN ONLY TO BE TOLD THEY ARE NOT RECALLS AND ARE EXTREMELY HIGH IN COST OUT OF POCKET. I HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING TO THEM FOR TWO YEARS TO NO AVAIL.

ON 03/02/2017, 151,551 MILES, LESS THAN 35,000 MILES SINCE THE FIRST CVT WAS REPLACED, THE DEALERSHIP, MCGAVOCK NISSAN, LUBBOCK, TX, DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM. THEIR SOLUTION IS TO REPLACE THE REPLACEMENT CVT. I CALLED NISSAN USA. NISSAN USA CALLED BACK AND ADVISED THEY WOULD NOT REPLACE THE CVT BECAUSE THE REPLACEMENT CVT WARRANTY WAS EXPIRED, 12 MONTHS AND/OR 12,000 MILES. NISSAN USA WAS OF NO HELP. THIS PROBLEM IS NOT ONLY ANNOYING, IT POSES A DANGER TO MY FAMILY! THE VEHICLE IS STILL RUNNING, HOWEVER, IT IS HARD TO CROSS A BUSY STREET BECAUSE IT STALLS ON TAKEOFF. DANGEROUS! I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS NISSAN ALTIMA. THE CVT IS A FAILURE TOP TO BOTTOM. NISSAN NEEDS TO DO THE RIGHT THING! DON'T INSTALL THIS TYPE TRANSMISSION IN THEIR VEHICLES!",

I TRIED TO ATTACH A PDF OF MY LETTER TO NISSAN NORTH AMERICA/[XXX] ...BUT IT IS 6.7M (TOO BIG).  NONETHELESS....I'LL BE HAPPY TO SHARE IT WITH YOU UPON REQUEST..    ALSO ATTACHED IS THE CAR'S COMPLETE SERVICE HISTORY WHICH WAS PROVIDED ONLY THROUGH THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP.

WITH ANOTHER 20 MILES TO AN EXIT, I WAS PRAYING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN MY CAR STARTED ACCELERATING AGAIN. I WAS NOT SURE IF I SHOULD HIT THE BRAKES AND BE STRANDED OR TAKE A CHANCE AND DRIVE UNTIL I REACH SAFETY. MY GAS MILEAGE FELL RAPIDLY, IT WENT DOWN FROM 100 MILES REMAINING TO 40 MILES AS I CHECKED.

THE MELTED AREAS HAVE A VERY SHINY APPEARANCE THAT CREATES SIGNIFICANT GLARE ON THE WINDSHIELD. AT CERTAIN ANGLES WITH SUNLIGHT THE GLARE CREATES A LARGE VISUAL DISTRACTION/OBSTRUCTION AND IT IS A DANGEROUS SAFETY HAZARD. THE REFLECTION FROM THE DASHBOARD ONTO THE WINDSHIELD CAN MAKE IT VERY HARD TO SEE PEDESTRIANS, OTHER CARS, TRAFFIC SIGNS; ANYTHING THAT IS IN THE AREA OF WINDSHIELD WITH THE REFLECTED GLARE BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE. IN ADDITION TO THE SAFETY CONCERNS, I CANNOT PUT ANYTHING ON THE DASHBOARD NOW. EVERYTHING I'VE PLACED ON IT WILL STICK TO THE DASH, AND WILL COME OFF WITH A STICKY BLACK RUBBER COATING ON IT WHEN REMOVED FROM THE DASH. IT'S AWFUL. AND I FEAR THAT THE SUBSTANCE MELTING COULD POSSIBLY BE CARCINOGENIC AND MAKING THE AIR IN THE CAR TOXIC. THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL FROM THE MANUFACTURER TO FIX IT. IT IS 100% A MANUFACTURER DEFECT. PLEASE MAKE NISSAN ADDRESS THIS ISSUE! PLEASE HELP WITH THIS! THANK YOU  *TR",

SINCE THEN THE MELTING AND STICKINESS ON THE COMPLETE TOP OF THE DASH BOARD IS GETTING WORSE.  INSIDE THE CAR NOW IT?S ALSO SMELLING LIKE MELTED TAR, WHICH MAY REPRESENT A HEALTH ISSUE WHEN BREATHING IT, AND WITH IT THE INTENSE GLARE, REFLECTION OF THE GLOSSY TAR ON THE FRONT WINDOW IT'S A SEVERE SAFETY HAZARD WHEN DRIVING, ESPECIALLY WHEN THIS ALSO COULD RESULT IN AIRBAGS BEING SUPPRESSED WHICH COULD FAIL TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROTECTION IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT. NISSAN REFUSES TO HELP REPLACE THIS DEFECTIVE DASH BOARD. LAST WEEK I CALLED NISSAN AGAIN.  THIS TIME BECAUSE THE A/C?S EVAPORATOR NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.I UNDERSTAND THE COST OF THIS WOULD BE MY RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY, BUT BECAUSE THIS IS UNDER THE DEFECTIVE DASH BOARD, THIS ONE WOULD HAVE TO BE REMOVED IN ORDER TO REPLACE THE EVAPORATOR.  ONCE REMOVED, THE MELTED DASH BOARD, NO GUARANTEE COULD BE INSTALLED AGAIN, I WAS TOLD BY SERVICE REP AT NISSAN.  A NISSAN SUPERVISOR TOLD ME THE SAME AS OTHERS AND SUGGESTED FOR ME TO CALL NHTSA AND FILE A COMPLAINT, SO THEY WOULD WORK ON A RECALL FOR THIS. MY A/C NEEDS TO BE FIXED.  I'M IN FL WHERE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND RAINY SEASON IT'S NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE TO DRIVE WITH WINDOWS DOWN. I'M AWARE THAT A/C REPAIR IS MY RESPONSIBILITY BUT I BELIEVE IT'S UNFAIR TO HAVE TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL 2,000 BECAUSE OF NISSAN'S DEFECTIVE MATERIAL USED ON DASHBOARDS. THIS IS A KNOWN CONCERN SINCE OTHERS HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE. IF NISSAN DOESN'T DO RIGHT BY ITS CONSUMERS AND OR A RECALL IS ISSUE, THERE WOULD BE MANY CONSUMERS IN THE FUTURE WITH RISKS OF ACCIDENTS AND/OR POSSIBLE RESPIRATORY HEALTH ISSUES.

FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT I TOOK MY 2008 ALTIMA TO THE DEALER TO ENSURE I WAS PART OF THE RECALL. THE DEALER IS AT 3275 SW 8TH STREET, ,MIAMI,, FLORIDA. AND IS CALLED AUTONATION NISSAN.  THE SERVICE AGENT TOTAL ME, AFTER CURSORY RESEARCH IN HIS DATA BASE, THAT WHILE MANY, MANY NISSANS WERE RECALLED IN MY MODEL YEAR AND IN MY CAR GROUP, MINE WAS NOT INCLUDED. THE SELECTION PROCESS FOR INCLUSION WENT BY SUPPLIER, AND NOT JUST BY TYPE OF CAR AND MODEL YEAR.   TO ASCERTAIN IF MY CAR HAD A FAULTY AIR BAG ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE FRONT SEAT, I WOULD THEREFORE HAVE TO PAY A $150 UPFRONT DIAGNOSTIC FEE, AND, IF DAMAGE WAS NOTED, I WOULD NEED TO PAY FOR REPAIRS MYSELF, AS MY CAR DID NOT HAVE THE AFFECTED PARTS WHICH WERE PROVIDED BY ONLY SELECT SUPPLIERS.    THERE IS A PROBLEM. I HAVE NOTED FOR SOME TIME THAT WHEN A PASSENGER IS SEATED IN THE FRONT, RIGHT SIDE, SEAT, A BEACON LIGHT IN A SMALL SQUARE BOX ON THE DASH BOARD FLASHES ON AND CLEARLY STATES: \"PASS. OFF - AIR BAG (X)  PSG.. 2\" THE REFERENCE FROM THE LIGHT LEAVES ONE WITH THE IMPRESSION THE AIR BAG, FOR THE PASSENGER IS NOT ACTIVATED. DURING A DRIVE, NO SET TIME PERIOD NOTED, THE LIGHT WILL GO OFF FOR A WHILE, AND LATER, COME BACK ON AGAIN.

WELL, TOO LATE BUT AFTER THE FACT I FOUND MANY YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE WITH THE EXACT SAME ISSUE.  IF YOU HEAR THIS WHINING NOISE, IT'S YOUR TRANSMISSION.

I ATTEMPTED TO HAVE THE DEALER REVIEW THIS AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE EXPERIENCE.  FINALLY, AFTER ANOTHER BOUT WITH THE CAR FAILING TO START, I TOOK IT INTO THE DEALER AND THEY RECOMMENDED THAT I SHOULD REPLACE THE BRAKE-STOP-LAMP-SWITCH, FOR A TOTAL COST OF ABOUT $450.   WHILE THIS WAS THE DEALER'S RECOMMENDATION, THEY WOULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT THIS WAS, IN FACT, THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM.   GREAT, I THOUGHT:  LET'S MAKE AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR THAT WE'RE UNSURE IS REALLY THE PROBLEM!

I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE IGNITION SYSTEM DIES AT 55K MILES.

MY BOYFRIEND AND I THEN PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY, AND AFTER ABOUT 10 MINUTES WE NOTICED THAT TRANSMISSION FLUID WAS LEAKING FROM THE CAR.  AFTER BEING TOWED TO THE MECHANIC ABOUT 20 MILES AWAY, HE WORKED ON THE CAR FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND COMPLETED AN OFFICIAL DIAGNOSTIC. HE SAID THE TRANSMISSION FLUID HAD OVERFLOWED FROM THE TRANSMISSION AND THAT WE COULD HAVE HAD A FIRE ON THE HIGHWAY.  HE ALSO CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS BLOWN AND THE CAR WAS NOT DRIVABLE. WE HAD TO STORE THE CAR IN THE MECHANIC'S PARKING LOT FOR THE NIGHT AND GET A RENTAL CAR. WE THEN HAD TO STAY IN A HOTEL FOR THE NIGHT IN GRAND JUNCTION, CO. THE NEXT DAY WE CALLED AROUND TO FIND A NISSAN SERVICE CENTER THAT WOULD BE OPEN TO ACCEPTING THE CAR AND COULD GET THE PARTS IN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME GIVEN THAT WE WERE STRANDED IN COLORADO.  WE FOUND A SERVICE CENTER IN AURORA ABOUT 250 MILES AWAY FROM GRAND JUNCTION. WE WORKED WITH AAA TO GET THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP JUST BEFORE THEY CLOSED. SINCE THEY WERE CLOSING THE NISSAN SERVICE CENTER DID NOT HAVE TIME TO LOOK AT THE CAR UNTIL MONDAY. I ENDED UP BEING STRANDED IN COLORADO FOR A 6 DAYS WITH MY BOYFRIEND, UNTIL THE CAR WAS FIXED.    I AM VERY DISPLEASED WITH NISSAN'S CUSTOMER SERVICE. I CALLED SPECIALISTS FOR 3 DAYS WITH NO HELP.  THEY HAVE REFUSED TO COMPENSATE ME FOR THE OTHER DAMAGES INCURRED BY THE FAULTY TRANSMISSION.

I APPLIED THE BRAKE AS USUAL SLOWLY TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP AND THE ENGINE BEGAN TO REV UP AND MADE AN INCREASINGLY LOUD NOISE. THE VEHICLE FELT AS THOUGH IT WANTED TO MOVE FORWARD IN TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC. THE HARDER I PRESSED THE BRAKE THE MORE IT REVVED UP.  MY FOOT WAS NOT ON THE ACCELERATOR AT ANY POINT. AFTER THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN, IT LURCHED FORWARD AND I IMMEDIATELY DROVE TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE CAR WAS PURCHASED LESS THAN A BLOCK AWAY. THE SERVICE MAN PLACED IT ON THE COMPUTER AND ALL KINDS OF RED LIGHTS FLICKERED. HE SAID SOMETHING IS WRONG BUT WE DON'T NO WHAT. THEY SEEMED TO BE AT A LOST. FINALLY I WAS TOLD THEY NEEDED TO DRIVE IT TO TRY TO RECREATE THE OCCURRENCE. CAR IS STILL AT THE DEALERSHIP AFTER 3 DAYS. THEY HAVE GIVEN ME A CAR TO DRIVE. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PURCHASE. CERTIFIED VEHICLE WITH A WRAP AROUND SERVICE WARRANTY WILL HOPEFULLY SAVE US EXPENSIVE REPAIR BILLS.  IN ANY CASE I DON'T WANT TO DRIVE IT ANYMORE BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL SAFE AT ALL.  I WANT TO TRADE IT AND REQUEST A BUY BACK IF THIS MATTER IS NOT RESOLVED.  HAVING THE MECHANIC TELL ME THERE IS NOTHING WRONG IS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE WE COULD HAVE LOST OUR LIVES.     OUR 11 YEAR OLD SON WAS IN THE CAR WITH ME AND WAS VERY FRIGHTENED. NO CAR IS WORTH THE RISK OF DRIVING DANGEROUSLY.  *TR",

I AM HOPING IF THERE IS A RECALL I WILL BE COMPENSATED FOR THIS REPAIR SINCE I AM CLAIMING THIS AS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CAR MANUFACTURER NISSAN AND/OR ANY OTHER ASSOCIATED ENTITIES.

I WAS DRIVING BETWEEN 45 TO 50 MPH, THE BREAKS STOPPED WORKING, I TAPPED THE BREAKS CONTINUOUSLY AND STILL THEY DID NOT WORK AFTER A FEW SECONDS THE STEERING WHEEL STARTING TURNING UN-CONTROLLABLY TO THE RIGHT, THEN TO THE LEFT. I TRIED TO PRESS ON THE BREAKS AND CONTROL THE VEHICLE BUT THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO SINCE THE BREAKS AND THE STEERING WHEEL WERE NOT WORKING. THE CAR HIT THE HIGHWAY SHOULDER ON THE LEFT AND THEN TURNED TO THE RIGHT. I BELIEVED THAT WAS THE END OF MY LIFE AND MY PASSANGER'S LIFE. AFTER ABOUT A MILE THE CAR CAME TO A STOP. I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED AN ACCIDENT BEFORE. I BOUGHT A BRAND NEW CAR SO I CAN AVOID TECHNICAL AND MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS. BUT I WAS NOT LUCKY BECAUSE MY ONE YEAR OLD NISSAN ALTIMA COUPLE HAD A MAJOR MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT ALMOST TOOK MY LIFE .     NOW ALL SAID AND DONE, IT HAS BEEN 10 DAYS THAT I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH NISSAN OF USA AND NISSAN OF GARDEN CITY. FOR THESE LONG TEN TRAUMATIZED DAYS THE ONLY ANSWER I GOT FROM NISSAN IS THAT THE CAR WILL BE INSPECTED AND THAT NISSAN IS GOING TO LET ME KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CAR. NISSAN DID NOT PROVIDE ME WITH A LOANER OR FUNDS TO RENT A CAR. IT HAS BEEN 10 DAYS THAT I HAVE BEEN RENTING CARS OR TAKING CABS PAYING FROM MY POCKET TO MAKE IT TO WORK. I AM OUT OF FUNDS AND NISSAN DOES WANT TO RESPOND TO THE ISSUE. I KNOW THAT THE CAR HAS A MAJOR MANUFACTURING PROBLEM. I WILL NOT DRIVE THAT CAR AGAIN UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. I DO NOT WANT THAT CAR TO BE DRIVEN FROM ANYONE ELSE BECAUSE I AM VERY SURE THAT CAR IS VERY DANGEROUS.  THIS CAR NEEDS TO BE INSPECTED CAREFULLY SO NISSAN CAN LEARN FROM THIS MISTAKE AND PREVENT FUTURE SIMILAR ACCIDENTS THAT CAN TURN DEADLY. NISSAN NEEDS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN MISTAKES.     I HOPE NHTSA WILL BE ABLE TO HELP IN THIS ISSUE. *TR    THANK YOU,  ALMA ULDEDAJ",
