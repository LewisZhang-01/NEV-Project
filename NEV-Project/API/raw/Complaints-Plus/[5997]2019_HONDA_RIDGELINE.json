I brought the truck to the dealership and they confirmed the problem and mentioned that they have replaced multiple wire harnesses on other Ridgelines with the same issue.  The dealership was unsure why there isn\u2019t a recall or at least a TSB.  I noted that the replacement part number is the same as the original and am concerned that this issue will again arise in the future.

FURTHERMORE, RIDGELINE CMBS ON IT'S OWN ENGAGES DRAMATICALLY LATE EVEN WHEN SET AT MAX DISTANCE, IN MY OPINION INEFFECTIVE FOR CRASH MITIGATION.  DRIVER SWITCHING FROM A SUBARU WITH EYESIGHT TO RIDGELINE WITH HONDA SENSING FOR EXAMPLE IN MY OPINION, CONSTITUTES A SAFETY HAZARD.  I HAVE RIDGELINE CMBS TURNED OFF UNTIL I GET CLARIFICATION FROM ANYONE AT HONDA WHO IS MORE INTERESTED IN SAFETY RATHER THAN LIABILITY.  AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR COMPANY WILL DISCUSS THIS VERBALLY ONLY AND VERY GUARDEDLY WITH LITTLE OR NO DISCUSSION HOW THE CMBS SYSTEM FUNCTIONS ON RIDGELINE.  THIS BEGS THE QUESTION, WHY OFFER CMBS AND ACC WHEN IT ONLY TELLS YOU ARE ABOUT TO HAVE A COLLISION RATHER THAN BRAKE TO A STOP, ALMOST LIKE A RADAR DETECTOR INFORMING YOU THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO GET A TICKET.
