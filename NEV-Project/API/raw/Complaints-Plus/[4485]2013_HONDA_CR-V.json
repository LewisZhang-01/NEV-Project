I have done research and this is no doubt a defect in many other people's car. This needs to be addressed how is this not a serious defeat and safety issue. You start off or pull out from a red light and it doesn't want to go, this IS a safety/accident concern. Please respond and please help.

However, I notice the vibration or shuddering occurs with acceleration-in 2nd or 3rd gear. When I take my foot off the gas pedal, the vibration/shuddering disappears. Other family members were telling me this is a transmission problem when this problem first occurred. On Honda vehicle blogs, I see this complaint is echoed by other 2013 Honda CRV owners.  I contacted Honda today.  They told me there is no national campaign or recall for my vehicle regarding this issue. They will create a case for this complaint but at this time, they will not offer me assistance with the repair. CRV's from other model years have had this issue and recalls were initiated.   Please offer me the same support from Honda for the same problem. Years ago, we had a 1991 Honda Accord that developed a transmission problem. We arranged for the repair of the transmission. Years later we found out there was a recall for the same issue for which we were not notified.  After many calls and letters, Honda eventually reimbursed us for that repair. Please assist us with our current problem.  Thank you.",

THERE IS NO WAY TO CONTROL CAMBER ON THE REAR WHEELS.  THERE ARE ADJUSTABLE ONES THAT CAN BE PURCHASED, BUT THAT COSTS CONSUMERS A TON OF MONEY.  $500 OR SO TOTAL THAT IS NOT COVERED BY ANY WARRANTY.  THE OBVIOUS DANGER IS EXCESSIVE WEAR ON TIRES THAT POTENTIALLY COULD CAUSE BAD STEERING, BRAKING, AND/OR CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.  AS FAR AS MY EXPERIENCE, I HAVE HAD TO BE EXTREMELY VIGILANT  ABOUT MAKING SURE MY TIRES ARE NOT IN BAD SHAPE 100% OF THE TIME.  THE DEALER HAS BASICALLY WALKED AWAY FROM IT, IN SPITE OF THE FACT I PURCHASED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY WHICH IS STILL IN EFFECT.    I MY OPINION, THE HONDA CORPORATION SHOULD HAVE A RECALL THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE BY REPLACING THE STOCK NONADJUSTABLE CONTROL ARM WITH AN ADJUSTABLE ONE.  THIS COULD SAVE THEM A TON OF ISSUES DOWN THE ROAD AND MAKE THEIR CARS MUCH SAFER.",

AT THAT MOMENT THE CAR LOST POWER...SEVERAL SECONDS LATER, THE PEDAL RESUMED ITS NORMAL FEEL AND POWER RESUMED...IT DID THIS 3 TIMES. RIGHT AT THE FIRST TIME IT DID THIS, I HEARD A TRIPLE CLICK (SOUNDED LIKE THE CLICKS YOU GET WHEN THE CAR DOES NOT TURN ON AFTER BATTERY DRAIN). SO, CLICK, CLICK, CLICK, LOSS OF POWER, POWER, LOSS OF POWER, POWER, LOSS OF POWER, POWER. I IMMEDIATELY GOT INTO THE RIGHT LANE THINKING THE CAR WAS GOING TO DIE ON ME AND EXPECTING TO HAVE TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE FREEWAY. MY HUSBAND WATCHED THE WHOLE THING IN OUR TRUCK SO HE HAD A GOOD VIEW. HE SAW 3 EXPULSIONS OF BLUISH EXHAUST COME OUT OF THE EXHAUST PIPE AND SAW THE CAR SLOW DOWN AT EACH OF THE POWER LOSS EVENTS. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND IT IS HAPPENING NO ONLY TO THIS CAR, BUT THE FORESTER AND RAV4 AND OTHERS.

I HAVE OWNED A NEW 1997 CRV, AND A NEW 2006 CRV. IN BOTH PREVIOUS VEHICLES, WHICH WERE PURCHASED NEW AND TRADED WITH OVER 250K MILES ON EACH, I HAD RECURRING PROBLEMS WITH HEADLIGHTS CONSTANTLY GOING OUT, OFTEN ONE WITHIN DAYS OF THE OTHER, AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE 2006 CRV, EVERY 3 TO 4 MONTHS. I WENT TO SEVERAL HONDA DEALERSHIPS ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS AND WAS ALWAYS TOLD THAT THERE WAS RECALL OR PERSISTENT PROBLEM. I COMMUTE 120 MILES ROUNDTRIP DAILY FOR WORK, AND I WORK IN A RURAL AREA, COVERING 6 VERY RURAL COUNTIES. SOMETIMES MY HEADLIGHT WOULD GO OUT WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON DARK, 2 LANE RURAL HIGHWAYS. IN THE 2006 VEHICLE, MY HEADLIGHTS WERE GOING OUT SO FREQUENTLY THAT I STARTED BUYING 2 BULBS AT A TIME SO THAT I ALWAYS HAD A BACK UP BULB. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD THAT HONDA HAS APPARENTLY AVOIDED FIXING OVER THE YEARS. I AM AWARE OF THE OWNER BLOGS FOR CRV-S WHERE MANY HONDA CRV OWNERS HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS.     I HAVE PUT FAMILY MEMBERS ON NOTICE THAT IF I AM INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT IN MY CAR AT NIGHT AND CANNOT SPEAK FOR MYSELF, THEY SHOULD PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION TO WHETHER MY HEADLIGHTS WERE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.    IN ADDITION, ON THIS 2013 CRV, NEITHER THE LOW BEAM NOR THE HIGH BEAM HEAD LIGHTS SEEM BRIGHT ENOUGH AT NIGHT.     ALTHOUGH I LOVE THE CR-V OTHERWISE, BECAUSE OF THIS PERSISTENT PROBLEM WITH THE HEADLIGHTS THAT I BELIEVE HONDA IS AWARE OF AND HAS CHOSEN NOT TO REPAIR, THIS WILL VERY LIKELY BE THE LAST HONDA THAT I PURCHASE.

I PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE, TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE, STARTED TO TURN TO LOOK BEHIND ME, HAD TO GRAB A BAG IN THE PASSENGER SEAT AND HAD NOT YET TOUCHED THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WHEN MY CAR CAME UP AGAINST ANOTHER VEHICLE WHICH WAS PARKED HALF WAY DOWN THE DRIVE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT I HAD HIT A DOG OR A CHILD, SOMETHING THAT MOVED TOWARD ME. I HAD NO REASON TO THINK A CAR COULD TRAVEL THAT FAST AND ON ITS OWN. IT CAUSED $886.00 IN 'MINOR' DAMAGE IN LESS THAN 3 SECONDS.  THIS SELF-PROPELLING FEATURE WAS NOT MENTIONED IN THE MANUAL (WHICH I DID READ) NOR BY THE DEALERSHIP, WHO LATER TOLD ME THE VEHICLE WAS FUNCTIONING WITHIN SPECS AND THIS MOVEMENT WAS TO BE EXPECTED.  AFTER POLLING 20 PEOPLE I UNDERSTOOD THERE ARE CARS WHICH 'CREEP' ONCE IN GEAR, SO I BORROWED 3 DIFFERENT VEHICLES TO TEST. FIRST I TRIED MY CAR. FROM A DEAD STOP, I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE BRAKE AND THE CAR PROPELLED ITSELF AT 7- 14 MPH (900-1200 RPM) FOR 1/2 MILE THROUGH MY NEIGHBORHOOD. I REPEATED THE TRIAL AFTER THE CAR WAS WARMED UP. NO CHANGE.  THEN I TESTED A 2014 FORD FOCUS, A 2008 LINCOLN MKZ, AND A 2013 CHEVROLET EQUINOX: SAME ROUTE AND CONDITIONS, NONE MOVED FASTER THAN 2-4 MPH. I LATER TEST DROVE A 2014 CRV AND IT ACCELERATES FASTER THAN MY 2013. I HAVE TO KEEP MY FOOT DEPRESSING THE BRAKE DURING SLOW TRAFFIC BECAUSE THE CAR MOVES BEFORE I FULLY RELEASE THE PEDDLE. THIS MEANS THE BRAKES ARE LIKELY TO WEAR OUT FASTER. I CAN'T BE SURE HOW THIS EFFECTS THE EXPECTED DECELERATION ONCE THE ACCELERATOR IS RELEASED.

CAR DID NOT RESPOND AT ALL TO BRAKE PEDAL BEING PUSHED. I TRIED REPEATEDLY TO PRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL BUT WAS MET WITH ONLY VERY LOUD CLICKING, PEDAL DID NOT APPEAR TO GO IN AS FAR AS NORMAL AND NO RESPONSE FROM CAR WHATSOEVER BY SLOWING DOWN. DEBATED WHETHER TO PUSH PARKING BRAKE IN OR TRY PUTTING CAR INTO LOWER GEAR WHEN I BRAKED YET AGAIN AND FINALLY CAR RESPONDED. BRAKING WAS OBVIOUS AND IMMEDIATE.    I WENT BACK TO THE SAME STRETCH OF ROAD AND ATTEMPTED TO RECREATE PROBLEM, BUT CAR CLICKED QUIETLY AND BRAKED IMMEDIATELY. AM CONCERNED THAT ABS SYSTEM WAS FIGHTING FOR CONTROL AND THEREFORE CAR DID NOT BRAKE AT ALL. ROADS WERE SNOWY AND A BIT SLICK, BUT NOT ICY. THIS OCCURRED OVER AN AREA OF ABOUT 100-150 FT.WHERE I ATTEMPTED REPEATEDLY TO BRAKE AND HAD NO RESPONSE WHATSOEVER.    I AM SCARED TO DRIVE MY CAR AGAIN IN SNOWY WEATHER. I HAVE OWNED MANY VEHICLES, INCLUDING THOSE WITH ABS AND HAVE DRIVEN IN THE SNOW AND HAVE NEVER HAD A CAR NOT RESPOND AT ALL. IT WAS LIKE THE BRAKES WERE NOT ENGAGING.  *TR",

THE MOST REENT INCIDENT WAS 12/16/13. THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT UNLOCK. I USED BOTH THE AFTER MARKET REMOTE START FOB, THE FOB ON THE ORIGINAL FACTORY KEY AND ALSO THE MANUAL UNLOCK BY PUTTING THE KEY IN THE DOOR. AFTER 2 HOURS OF CONSTANTLY PUSHING BUTTONS AND CHECKING ALL ENTRANCES TO THE VEHICLE, THE VEHICLE UNLOCKED ON IT'S OWN, WITHOUT PUSHING ANY OF THE BUTTONS. MY 15 MONTH OLD CHILD AND I WERE LITERALLY STRANDED FOR THESE 2 HOURS UNTIL A TOW TRUCK COULD COME TO US. NOT TO MENTION THAT THE CAR UNLOCKED ITSELF ON IT'S OWN RIGHT BEFORE THE TOW COMPANY SHOWED UP. WHAT IF MY CHILD HAD BEEN INSIDE OF THE VEHICLE WHEN THIS HAPPENED????  *TR",

BELIEVE IT  OR NOT, I HAVE NOT DRIVEN THIS CAR AFTER DARK UNTIL JUST RECENTLY. WHEN DRIVING I COULD HARDLY SEE MUCH IN FRONT OF ME AT ALL. THE LOW BEAMS ARE MOST INADEQUATE AND THE HIGH BEAMS ARE USELESS. THE ROAD IF FRONT OF THE CAR WAS BARELY LIT UP AT ALL. IT WAS A VERY SCARY SITUATION, HAS NEVER HAPPENED WITH ANY OTHER CAR I HAVE OWNED. I WENT  AROUND A CURVE AND ALMOST DROVE OFF THE ROAD. AND IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT, NO RAIN, FOG ETC. I PAID OVER $30,000.00 FOR THIS CAR AND AM AFRAID TO DRIVE IT AT NIGHT!!  AS SAFETY CONSCIOUS AS HONDA IS, I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THIS SITUATION IS ACCEPTABLE TO THEM. IT CERTAINLY ISN'T FOR ME. PLEASE, CAN YOU TELL ME IF THERE IS A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM ( CHANGING BULBS, ETC). I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY FEEDBACK TO HELP RESOLVE THIS DANGEROUS SITUATION.

I TEST DROVE MY CAR AND PURCHASED IT AROUND 12 NOON SO THAT IS WHY I DID NOT GET A CHANCE TO TEST THE HEAD LIGHTS. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY GIVE YOU A VERY POOR VISIBILITY, ESPECIALLY, IT'S HIGH BEAMS ARE EVEN WORST THAN THE LOW BEAMS. WHEN YOU DRIVE AT NIGHT YOU DON'T FEEL SAFE AND MUST USE YOUR FOG LIGHTS!!!! IT IS SAD BUT TRUE... I HOPE THAT HONDA WILL NOTICE THE PROBLEM AND REPLACE THOSE TERRIBLE HEAD LIGHTS.  *TR",
