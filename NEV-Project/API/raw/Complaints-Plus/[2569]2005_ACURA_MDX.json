We were driving in clear weather on a new street at 35 miles an hour.  The passenger side seat airbag and the right side curtain deployed. My wife was sitting in the front passenger seat. There was no collision or hazard. The Airbag just exploded. We were not hit by any metal objects. The Mdx is in perfect working order and we are now told no one will cover the damage. Insurance and the Dealership. We are writing to find out how we can get a fair outcome from our car becoming unusable due to manufactures defect. We have not touched the airbag or the car since this happened. Would we be able to have it inspected?",

I don't remember having this problem prior to the last couple years. It is a safety issue and dangerous to others and if I can't get it repaired I would need to get rid of it. The problem is it is still in very good shape otherwise and has many more miles to give. There is no warning to help me remember to put it in park. This started happening sometime in mid 2018.

I ALSO READ IT'S BEST TO KEEP THIS FEATURE OFF WHILE COMMUTING IN YOUR REGULAR EVERYDAY TRANSIT.

DUE TO THE SPEED OF THE CAR, THE CONCRETE BASE WAS LIFTED FROM THE GROUND AND THE POLE FELL IN FRONT AWAY FROM THE CAR. WE BOTH CHECKED INTO THE HOSPITAL IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CRASH. THIS WAS CAUSED BY MANUFACTURING DEFECT IN THE CAR. THE REASON I SAY THIS IS BECAUSE:  A) I JUST LEFT THE PRAYER HALL, WHERE I GO FREQUENTLY AND AM FAMILIAR WITH THE SURROUNDING WHERE OTHER CARS ARE PARKED AND MOVING, PEOPLE ARE WALKING TO AND FROM THEIR CARS, AND HAD NO REASON TO ACCELERATE;  B) I HAVE BEEN DRIVING ACCIDENT FREE FOR PAST 39 YEARS, MY DRIVING RECORD SPEAKS FOR ITSELF;  C) DRIVING IS REQUIRED IN THE PROFESSION I AM IN, WHERE I HAVE TO VISIT CLIENTS FEW TIMES A WEEK;    D) I AM FAMILIAR WITH THE CAR BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN DRIVING THIS CAR FOR OVER 4 YEARS.  E) I AM A FAMILY MAN AND NOT A RECKLESS DRIVER. I CARE TOO MUCH FOR MY FAMILY, AND ESPECIALLY MY GRANDSON, TO TAKE A CHANCE LIKE THIS;  F) I AM PERFECTLY HEALTHY AND CONSCIOUS ABOUT MY SURROUNDINGS.  IT HAS BEEN SIX WEEKS AND WE ARE STILL EXPERIENCING PAIN FROM THE INJURY.  I BELIEVE SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO AVOID SUCH INCIDENTS IN FUTURE. THIS CRASH COULD HAVE BEEN FATAL.",

IT STARTED TO HAPPEN ALMOST EVERY TIME I ACCELERATE THE CAR OR HOLDING THIS SPEED ON A SLIGHT INCLINE LEVEL.  I HAVE HAD MY MECHANIC TO LOOK AT IT & WAS TOLD THIS NOISE IS A TRANSMISSION/TORQUE CONVERTER PROBLEM. IT'S COMMON TO ACURA MDXS. & ALSO, ADVISED TO TAKE IT TO ACURA DEALER.  ON OCT-2009 CAR WAS PLACED FOR SERVICE @ AUTHORIZED  ACURA DEALER. WHERE DEALER STATE THAT IT'S OUT OF COMPANY WARRANTY. THE GEAR SHIFT CABLE AS WELL AS TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED WITH 3-YEAR WARRANTY ACURA DEALER AT MY (OWNER) EXPENSE 5K.  AGAIN, IN JUNE-2012 @ 89K  MILEAGES, SAME PROBLEM STARTED.

DEALER STATE THAT THE GEAR SHIFT CABLE WAS COVERED WITH RUST. WHICH I BELIEVE THE FAILURE WAS A ACURA DESIGN FLAW.

A VEHICLE OF THIS CALIBRE ON A LUXURY LINE, COSTING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IS SUPPOSED TO LIVE UP TO ITS REPUTATION. TO BE FURTHER PROACTIVE, I ASK ALL THE MDXERS FOR US TO START A CHAIN BLOG FOR ACURA AND THE OTHER CAR MANUFACTURERS TO SEE HOW EXTENSIVE THESE PROBLEMS ARE. ACURA HAS BEEN LESS THAN COOPERATIVE DURING MY INTERACTIONS WITH THEM.  SO FIRST LET ME TALK ABOUT THE PROBLEMS AND ISSUES ON MY MDX.  IT STARTED WITH GRINDING AND WHINING NOISES COMING FROM MY 2005 MDX WHILE STILL UNDER WARRANTY. I BROUGHT IT IN TO OPEN ROAD ACURA OF WAYNE, NJ SEVERAL TIMES TO FIX THE PROBLEM BUT ISSUE STILL REMAIN TODAY. FINALLY, I WAS TOLD THAT THE TRANSMISSION WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED AT MY EXPENSE TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM. WHEN DRIVING 50-60 MPH, WHINING NOISE FROM ENGINE AREA DEVELOPS. IT CAN BE UNBEARABLE SOMETIMES, SORT OF WHAT YOU EXPERIENCE WITH EARACHES ON A PLANE. THE ENGINE IDLES ROUGH, IN A GRUNTING WAY. INITIALLY, CONSTANT NOISE CAME FROM THE TENSIONER PULLEY. I PAID AND GOT THAT FIXED EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS A RECALL ISSUE. TWO WEEKS INTO BUYING THE CAR BRAND NEW, SOMETHING IN THE DROP DOWN DVD SCREEN WAS RATTLING AND I GOT THAT FIXED. THEN, THE DVD/NAV FROZE ON ME CAUSING YET ANOTHER REPAIR AND TIME LOST. SO, NOW BACK TO THIS TRANSMISSION PROBLEM. I CONTACTED ACURA HQ AND THEY ASKED ME TO CONTACT THE DEALER. I ASKED FOR THEM TO INITIATE CALL TO DEALER BUT SAID THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO DO SO AND ALL REPAIRS IS AT DISCRETION OF DEALER. NOW WHAT HAPPENS IF CAR SEIZES WHILE I'M DRIVING CAUSING SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH? ACURA HAS REFUSED TO EVEN CALL ME BACK AS A COURTESY AND HAS NEVER DONE SO WITH ITS CUSTOMER. THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY BUT DEALER CLAIMS ITS AT THEIR COST. DEALER SERVICE IS GOOD, POLICY IS BAD.  *TR",

ACURA DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE A REAL FIX FOR THE PROBLEM, THEY JUST REPLACE ONE FAULTY PART WITH ANOTHER.  THIS PART, AFTER RESEARCHING ONLINE, SEEMS TO MALFUNCTION WAY TOO OFTEN, AND I BELIEVE WOULD BE GROUNDS FOR A COMPANY RECALL.  MY MDX IS CURRENTLY SITTING IN THE GARAGE UNTIL I COME UP WITH THE MONEY FOR THE FIX, BUT AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED IT WILL JUST HAPPEN AGAIN.  THE FAULT IN THIS PART SEEMS TO BE A DESIGN ISSUE AND NOT FROM NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR GIVEN THE TIME BETWEEN RECURRENCES OTHER MDX OWNERS HAVE ADDRESSED.

I KNOW THIS IS NOT A RECALL BUT WANTED TO MAKE YOU AWARE OF A BOOMING SOUND THAT IS COMING FROM THE SUB-WOOFER IN THE REAR. ITS ALMOST IF THE WOOFER IS LOOSE INSIDE THE REAR OF THE CAR. I GUESS A LOT OF OTHER 2005 MDX OWNERS ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.  ITS A PROCEDURE WHERE THE INTERIOR HAS TO BE TAKEN OFF AND AN ADHESIVE IS PUT AROUND THE SUBWOOFER TO SECURE IT TO THE VEHICLE.    YOU MIGHT WANT TO REPORT THIS TO ACURA.   I HOPE THIS HELPS. *JB",
