I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED BOTH THE TOYOTA DEALER THAT SERVICES MY CAR, AND TOYOTA CORPORATE.

WHEN I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE DEALER OR TOYOTA CORPORATE, THEY TELL ME THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG IT MIGHT BE BEFORE THE PARTS ARE AVAILABLE OR THE TECHNICIANS TRAINED TO REPLACE THE FAULTY AIRBAG.  TOYOTA ALSO REFUSES TO PROVIDE ANY REMEDIATION IN THE MEANTIME -- NO LOANER CAR, NO DISABLED AIRBAG, NOTHING.       THE ONLY REASON I KNOW THAT MY CAR -- WHICH I SHARE WITH MY SON -- IS POTENTIALLY LETHAL IS BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO HAVE CHECKED MY VIN AFTER READING AN ARTICLE IN THE NEWSPAPER.

ON TUESDAY THEY DIDN'T CALL I HAD TO CALL, I HAD TO CALL MULTIPLE TIMES TO REACH ANYONE, AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PART, IT WAS BACK-ORDERED AND COULD BE UP TO A FEW WEEKS. I AGAIN PUSHED FOR A LONER CAR, THEY SAID THEY WOULD SEE IF THEY COULD AUTHORIZE IT AND CALL ME IN THE MORNING. IN THE MORNING THEY HAD SOMEHOW MANAGED TO FIND A PART, PUT IT IN, I WAS THEN TOLD THAT THE FUEL SYSTEM NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. MY CAR WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION BEFORE THIS, THERE IS NO WAY THE FUEL SYSTEM MIRACULOUSLY WENT BAD AT THE EXACT SAME TIME THAT THE RECALLED PART WENT OUT - IT HAD TO BE CAUSED BY THE COMPUTER FAILURE. BESIDES THAT I WAS TOLD THAT THE COMPUTER PART WAS THE ONLY THING WRONG WITH MY CAR. THEN THEY TRIED TO OVERCHARGE MY BY $600 FOR THE FUEL SYSTEM, ALL THE WHILE STILL NOT GIVING ME A LONER CAR. IN SUMMARY MY CAR DIED ON MY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, I HAD TO PAY FOR MY TOWING, MISS HOURS OF WORK, BE CARELESS FOR 6 DAYS AND PAY FOR A NEW FUEL SYSTEM ALL THANKS TO THE RECALLED PART. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THE PARTS THAT WERE DAMAGED BY THE RECALL PROBLEMS.",
