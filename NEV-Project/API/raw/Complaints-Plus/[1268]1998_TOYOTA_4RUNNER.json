HIS VEHICLE WAS GRANTED 1.5 TIMES OVER KELLY BLUE BOOK VALUE AND THE VEHICLE WAS SEIZED FROM HIM AT THE TIME DUE TO SAFETY.      MY 4 RUNNER IS ONLY 13 YEARS OLD WITH A KELLY BLUE BOOK VALUE OF 6500.00.  IT LOOKS AND RUNS GREAT.  BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS VEHICLE IS NOT WORTH THAT NOW AND CANNOT BE SOLD DUE TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE FRAME.  IT ALSO CANNOT BE REPAIRED.  EVENTUALLY THIS WILL RESULT IN A FAILURE AND DEPENDING ON WHAT SPEED THE VEHICLE IS TRAVELING AT THE TIME WILL TELL HOW SERIOUS THE ACCIDENT WILL BE.    IT APPEARS THAT TOYOTA HAS VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH MY CONCERNS.  I SENT THREE CERTIFIED LETTERS TO TOYOTA EXPRESSING MY CONCERNS WITH SAFETY.  THE LETTER SENT TO THE PRESIDENT YOSHIMI INABA THAT WAS NOT FORWARDED TO HIM, WAS RETURNED DUE TO AN ERRONEOUS ADDRESS SO IT APPEARS HE IS BEING SHELTERED. I WAS OFFERED $500.00 REIMBURSEMENT ON SERVICE, PARTS OR ACCESSORIES OR A 1500.00 'GIFT' BASED ON TOYOTA'S 'GOODWILL OFFER' TOWARDS A NEW TOYOTA.  THIS \"GIFT\" WAS OFFERED BY AN EXECUTIVE ANALYST WITH TOYOTA CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE WHOM APPARENTLY DOESN'T WANT THE TOP EXECUTIVES TO RECEIVE CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS.  BASED ON COMPARISONS THAT THE TACOMA AND TUNDRA OWNERS RECEIVED, I DON'T FEEL THE SO-CALLED \"GOODWILL\" OF BEING A TOYOTA CUSTOMER.  IT SEEMS THERE MUST BE LITIGATION TO GET TOYOTA'S WELL-BRAGGED-ABOUT CUSTOMER CARE. SAFETY IS #1 AT TOYOTA IF THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE A NEW SALE!  SAFETY FOR OLD CUSTOMERS IS OUT THE WINDOW IF THE SALE IS FROM THE PAST.  LOOKS LIKE TOYOTA DOES NOT REALLY BACK THEIR PRODUCTS UNLESS THERE IS A DEATH.  *TR",

DRIVING I-95 IN NORTH FLORIDA AT APPROX. 72 MPH, I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE ACCELERATOR TO BEGIN A LANE CHANGE AS I APPROACHED A SLOWER VEHICLE TO THE FRONT. THE ACCELERATOR, OF ITS OWN ACCORD, PRESSED ITSELF TO THE FLOOR AND THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO ACCELERATE ON ITS OWN, REACHING A SPEED OF 93 MPH WITHIN A FEW SECONDS. I APPLIED THE BRAKES, WHICH WERE TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE; THE VEHICLE CONTINUED TO INCREASE IN SPEED. I CAME WITHIN A FEW FEET OF REAR-ENDING THE CAR I HAD BEGUN TO GO AROUND, AND JUST BEFORE IMPACT I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION, WHICH CUT OFF THE MOTOR. I MOVED FROM THE MIDDLE LANE TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD, AND WHILE COASTING, TURNED THE KEY BACK TO THE 'ON' POSITION, WITHOUT STARTING THE MOTOR.  INSTANTLY THE MOTOR REVVED ON ITS OWN TO TACH REDLINE, AND I TURNED THE KEY TO THE 'ACC' POSITION; THE MOTOR SHUT OFF.  THIS OCCURRED THREE TIMES, AND THE ENTIRE TIME THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WAS PRESSED TO THE FLOOR.  IT WAS NOT STUCK UNDER THE FLOOR MAT, AS I CHECKED THIS WHILE COASTING. THE PEDAL COULD NOT BE PRIED UP BY MY TOE, BUT WAS STUCK FAST.  I HAD REDUCED SPEED TO ABOUT 30 MPH. AFTER 1/2 MI COASTING, THE PEDAL RETURNED TO THE NORMAL POSITION ON ITS OWN, AND I WAS ABLE TO START THE CAR. IT DROVE NORMALLY THE ENTIRE WAY HOME, ABOUT 60 MILES. IF I HAD PANICKED AND NOT TURNED OFF THE ENGINE WITHIN THE FEW SECONDS I HAD, I WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY IMPACTED THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A CRASH IN EXCESS OF 90MPH. THERE WAS TRAFFIC AROUND ME AT THAT POINT, AND IT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A MULTIPLE-CAR CRASH. THIS IS MY WIFE'S CAR AND I CANNOT LET HER DRIVE THE CAR AGAIN. I FIND NO RECALLS, BUT THIS SITUATION MOST CERTAINLY WAS VERY REAL, AND VERY DANGEROUS. THIS IS NOT TO BE DISMISSED BY CALLING IT 'DRIVER ERROR', OR A PEDAL STUCK UNDER A MAT.

I ALWAYS MAINTAINED RECOMMENDED PRESSURES AND JUST ROTATED THEM MYSELF LAST WEEK AFTER OUR PREVIOUS LAS VEGAS TRIP.  ON OUR WAY BACK FROM LAS VEGAS JULY 19, 2004 2 PM NEAR FONTANA THE CAR BEGAN TO SHAKE PROGRESSIVELY UNTIL IT WAS UNDRIVEABLE ABOVE 45 MPH SO I PULLED OVER TO A SMALL TURNOUT.  I CHANGED THE LEFT REAR TIRE THAT I FOUND HAD A MAJOR BULGE (3 INCH DIAMETER BUBBLE ON SIDEWALL WHICH CONTINUED ANOTHER 3 INCHES INTO THE TREAD.)  CHANGED IT TO THE SPARE AND CAR STILL SHOOK WHEN DRIVEN.  FOUND OUT THE FRONT RIGHT TIRE WAS WORSE, ABOUT 1/3 THE CIRCUMFERENCE WAS BUBBLED MAKING THE TIRE LOOK EGG SHAPED FROM THE SIDE.  LOOKS LIKE MORE THAN TREAD SEPARATION, POSSIBLY BROKEN BELTS SINCE THE BUBBLES HAD AIR PRESSURE.  DROVE 10 MILES TO A DISCOUNT TIRE CENTER AND HAD 2 TIRES CHANGED AT A PRORATED CHARGE (KUMHO VENTURE) THEY KEPT THE OLD TIRES. 45 MILES LATER AND JUST BEFORE MY EXIT ON THE FREEWAY THE CAR BEGAN TO SHAKE.  LUCKILY WE HIT TRAFFIC NEAR OUR EXIT AND WE WERE GOING 10 MPH WHEN THE THIRD DUNLOP WENT TOTALLY FLAT.  I WILL HAVE THAT TIRE AND THE 4TH ONE CHANGED TODAY.  *LA",

THIS PROBLEM COULD ALSO POST A DIFFICULT-TO-QUANTIFY SAFETY ISSUE AS MANY 4RUNNER OWNERS DRIVE AROUND MISSING ONE TAIL LIGHT.
