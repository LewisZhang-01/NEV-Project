THERE WAS A RECALL FOR IT AND APPARENTLY IT WAS FIXED IN 2009 BUT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM AGAIN THAT IS GETTING WORSE. WHEN I TRY TO OPEN THE DOOR TO GET MY CHILD OUT THE DOOR HANDLE DOES NOT ENGAGE, I HAVE TO TRY TO OPEN FROM INSIDE AND SOMETIMES THAT DOES NTO ENGAGE, SO THEN I HAVE TO SLIDE THE LOCK BACK AND FORTH AND CONTINUE TO TRY TO OPEN THE DOOR UNTIL IT FINALLY OPENS. THIS OBVIOUSLY IS A BIG SAFETY PROBLEM IF WE WERE EVER TO BE IN AN ACCIDENT ETC. I CALLED MAZDA AND THEY SAID RECALL IS CLOSED AND THEY CAN NOT HELP ME UNLESS I WANT TO PAY DIAGNOSTIC FEE OF 140 AND THEN WHATEVER THE REPAIR IS ON TOP OF THAT.   THE SECOND PROBLEM IS THE BRAKES. THEY DO NOT WORK WELL UNDER IDEAL CONDITIONS, BUT WHEN IT RAINS SOMETIMES THEY STOP WORKING ALL TOGETHER. I'VE ALMOST BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT SEVERAL TIMES WHEN THEY SUDDNELY GO SOFT AND JUST STOP WORKING. I HAVE TO CONTINUOUSLY PUMP THE BRAKES TO TRY TO GET ANY TRACTION AND THEN STOP DRIVING UNTIL THEY DRY OUT. WE'VE HAD THE ENTIRE BRAKE SYSTEM REPLACED AND MECHANICS SAY NOTHING IS WRONG, BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS JUST A BAD DESIGN AND SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WRONG. WE CAN'T AFFORD A NEW CAR BUT DON'T' FEEL SAFE IN THIS CAR, NOT SURE WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.",

IF WE TURNED THE CAR OFF, WAITED A MINUTE, THEN RESTARTED THE CAR, IT WOULD DRIVE FINE (UNTIL THE PROBLEM REPEATED ITSELF AT ANOTHER RANDOM TIME). THE DEALER MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR. THEY FIRST CHANGED THE THROTTLE BODY, BUT THEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN TO US WITHIN 30 MINUTES OF THE REPAIR.  THEY NEXT CHANGED THE ACCEL PEDAL, BUT IT AGAIN HAPPENED AS WE PULLED OUT OF THE DEALER ACROSS TRAFFIC LEAVING US VULNERABLE TO A SEVERE ACCIDENT.  FINALLY, THEY REPLACED A GROUND WIRE FOR THE ACCEL PEDAL AND THE PROBLEM \"SEEMS\" TO BE RESOLVED.  I SAY \"SEEMS\" BECAUSE THE CAR DOES NOT DRIVE LIKE IT DID BEFORE THE PROBLEMS STARTED.  THERE STILL SEEMS TO BE A STUMBLE, BUT NO STALLING.  SINCE THE CAR DOES NOT STALL, WE ARE NOT TAKING IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP, BUT WE GET VERY NERVOUS EACH TIME WE FEEL A SLIGHT STUMBLE.  THIS PROBLEM SEEMS SIMILAR TO THE \"DRIVE-BY-WIRE\" PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED BY TOYOTA DRIVERS AND HAS POTENTIAL FOR A SEVERE ACCIDENT, SO I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTHY OF REPORTING. *TR",

ASKED DEALER ABOUT LACK OF TRACTION, ESPECIALLY WHEN STARTING TO ACCELERATE, THEY WERE AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND SAID IT WAS DUE TO THE POWER OF THE ENGINE.  SOME CUSTOMERS HAD THE SAME COMPLAINT, OTHERS DIDN'T.  AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS, I DEFINITELY DID NOT FEEL THE VEHICLE WAS SAFE FOR MY TEENAGERS TO DRIVE, AS THE LACK OF TRACTION ON WET ROADS WAS A SAFETY CONCERN.  ASKED DEALER TO SWITCH TIRES, WAS TOLD I WOULD HAVE TO CONTACT THE TIRE MANUFACTURER IF IT WAS A TIRE DEFECT, BUT THIS WAS THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CAR.  CONTACTED MAZDA CUSTOMER SERVICE, WHO ALSO WOULD NOT ADDRESS THIS SAFETY COMPLAINT AND TOLD ME I COULD PURCHASE DIFFERENT TIRES.  BROUGHT TO A SECOND DEALERSHIP TO ASK ABOUT ISSUE, SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THIS WAS DUE TO A TURBO IN THE ENGINE CREATING ALOT OF POWER AT LOW GEARS.  I WAS NOT AWARE OF ANY TURBO...MECHANIC SUGGESTED THE TRACTION CONTROL MODEL WOULD HAVE HELPED THIS ISSUE..THERE IS NO TRACTION CONTROL MODEL AVAILABLE, AS FAR AS I KNOW.  I LIKE MANY THINGS ABOUT THIS CAR, BUT REALLY FEEL THIS LOSS OF TRACTION UPON ACCELERATION WILL CAUSE AN ACCIDENT--WE LIVE ON A BUSY ROAD AND TIMING IS CRUCIAL TO PULL OUT OF OUR DRIVEWAY.  WE HAVE OWNED OVER 15 CARS AND HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS LACK OF SAFETY ON A VEHICLE--EVEN ON THE TURBOS WE HAVE OWNED!  THIS IS A NEW MODEL, AND I THINK MORE PEOPLE WILL NOTICE THE TIRES SLIPPING AS MORE OF THESE ARE SOLD.  I WISH THERE WAS A TRACTION CONTROL OPTION, OR THAT MAZDA WOULD HAVE AGREED TO TRY DIFFERENT TIRES.  WE HAVE 5500 MILES ON THE CAR AND I DO NOT WANT MY TEENS IN IT ON RAINY OR SNOWY DAYS.  *NM",
