I CONTACTED BRIDGESTONE VIA EMAIL BUT GOT NO RESPONDS I CONTACTED THEM BY PHONE THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS REASON FOR ME TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE TIRE FAILURES I HAD EXPERIENCED EVEN THOUGH 40 % OF THE TIRES HAD PURCHASED THIS YEAR.  3,000 MILES ON FIRST TIRE EVEN LESS ON THE SECOND TIRE ,THE TIRE DEALER CONTACTED BRIDGSTONE AND REPLACED THE TIRE WITH A FIRESTONE TIRE SINCE BRIDGESTONE NO LONGER MAKER THE INSIGNIA AND HE DID NOT WANT TO USE ANOTHER INSIGNIA BECAUSE OF WHAT HE FELT WAS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT HAD BEEN SEEN IN THE INSIGNIAS AND OTHER TIRES THAT BRIDGSTONE MAKES SOME OF WITCH HAVE ALREADY RECALLED I WILL KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON REST OF TIRES.IN MY 40 YEARS OF DRIVING THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST SET OF TIRES I HAVE EVER OWNED . BRIDGESTONE SHOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND RECALL THIS TIRE BEFORE A TIRE FAILURE CAUSES A FATAL INJURY TO SOME ONE .BUT I AM SURE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF RESPONCE AND UNCONCERN OF THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD SPOKE TO AT BRIDGESTONE . MY LOCAL TIRE DEALER IS SEND MY FAILED TIRE TO BRIDGESTONES TECH'S LETS SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.  *TR",

THE SERVICE MANAGER AT DUNCANVILLE FORD REFUSED TO EVEN LOOK AT MY VEHICLE WITHOUT CHARGING ME A $47 DIAGNOSTIC FEE.  WHEN I TOLD HIM THE BACK GATE WAS GOING TO FALL AND BREAK, HE TOLD ME TO PULL MY TRUCK INTO THE SERVICE BAY, THE CHARGE IS $47 AND THAT DID NOT INCLUDE REPAIR COSTS.  I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO A LOCAL BODY SHOP TO REPAIR. THE BODY SHOP REPLACED THE LEFT LIFTGATE HINGE, BUT DUE TO THE ENTIRE WEIGHT OF THE HATCH RESTING ON THE RIGHT HINGE, IT BENT AS WELL.  I DROVE TO GRAND PRAIRIE FORD TO PURCHASE THE PART AT WHICH TIME I WAS TOLD ABOUT THE RECALL.  I WAS ADVISED TO TAKE MY VEHICLE BACK TO DUNCANVILLE FORD SO THEY COULD REPAIR THE LIFTGATE HINGE AND CHECK THE STRUTS FOR DAMAGE, WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL NOTIFICATION.  THE BODY SHOP ATTACHED THE HINGE (WITHOUT THE EPOXY) SO THE HATCH WOULD NOT FALL OFF AND I RETURNED TO DUNCANVILLE FORD.  I ASKED HIM WHY WASN'T I TOLD ABOUT THE RECALL WHEN I ARRIVED IN THE MORNING AND HIS RESPONSE WAS, MAYBE THE SERVICE MANAGER DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE RECALL.  I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.

SINCE THIS IS AN ON GOING ISSUE ON FORD VEHICLES FOR PAST 15 YEARS, IT SEEMS REASONABLE THAT THE SERVICE MANAGER WOULD REMEMBER THAT.
