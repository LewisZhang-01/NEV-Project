AS I WAS LOOKING UNDER THE HOOD, I HEARD FLUID LEAKING, SO I STARTED LOOKING AROUND, AND WHEN I LOOKED AT THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR, THERE WAS A HUGE OIL SPILL.

WHILE WE AVOIDED BEING KILLED BY ONCOMING VEHICLES, WE WERE ALSO IN DANGER AS WE MOVED THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY.  AFTER TOWING THE VEHICLE TO A REPUTABLE TRANSMISSION SHOP, HE FOUND THE ISSUE TO BE A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE COOLANT FLUID LEAKING INTO THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION, CAUSING TOTAL FAILURE.  ESTIMATES ARE OVER $6,000 FOR REBUILDING OR REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION WITH PARTS AND LABOR, INCLUDING THE REQUIRED ADDITION OF A \"COOLER\" INSTEAD OF THE RADIATOR.  I ATTEMPTED TO FILE THIS WITH MY CAR INSURANCE BUT WAS DENIED COVERAGE.  NOW, THE 2007 PATHFINDER IS HAVING THE SAME SYMPTOMS WITH SLIPPAGE AND INABILITY TO USE OVERDRIVE, WHICH ALMOST CAUSE ANOTHER MULTI-CAR PILE-UP IN HOUSTON TRAFFIC UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO DOWNSHIFT AND MOVE ASIDE.  IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE 2007 PATHFINDER TRANSMISSION ALSO FAILS COMPLETELY, AND I STILL OWE $12,000 TO THE CREDIT UNION ON BOTH LOANS COMBINED.  I ATTEMPTED A LOAN FOR REPAIRS THROUGH THE TRANSMISSION SHOP, BUT WAS DENIED DUE TO BAD CREDIT FROM A LAY-OFF LAST YEAR.  NISSAN, PLEASE ISSUE A RECALL FOR THOSE OF US WITHOUT HOPE AND UNABLE TO BUY A NEW VEHICLE.  THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO SAVE LIVES AND BOOST YOUR BRAND TO A HIGHER LEVEL, THROUGH INTEGRITY.",

I HAVE SPENT OVER $7000 IN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF, OUTSIDE OF NORMAL UPKEEP LIKE TIRES AND BRAKES, ON REPAIRS FOR THIS VEHICLE. I AM A SINGLE MOTHER WITH 2 SMALL CHILDREN! MY HUSBAND WAS KILLED IN 2014. DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT'S BEEN FOR ME TO GET ALL THIS DONE?!?!  BUT I HAD TO, IT'S PAID OFF AND I DON'T WANT A NEW CAR NOTE! REPLACING A TRANSMISSION THAT THE COMPANY I FEEL KNOWS IS FAULTY IS REALLY UNJUST.  I INITIALLY PAID $1800 TO GET IT FIXED FOR IT ONLY TO CONTINUE MESSING UP AGAIN. I WAS TOLD THEM THEY PROBABLY REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION BUT NOT THE COMPUTER AND RADIATOR WHICH IS THE MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLE. I THEN PAID ANOTHER $2400 TO GET IT FIXED CORRECTLY.  THEN, THERE WAS THE TIMING CHAIN ISSUE, WHY DID IT BREAK, WHO KNOWS, BUT IT SHOULDN'T HAVE.. SO THAT WAS ANOTHER $2300. I'VE ALSO HAD TO REPLACE BOTH SIDES OF THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER WHICH WERE ABOUT $300 EACH AND A BALL BARING I BELIEVE ITS CALLED WAS GONE. CURRENTLY, MY HORN ONLY WORKS WHEN YOU TURN THE STEERING WHEEL LEFT AND STEERING IS GETTING HARDER TO TURN SO I THINK MY PUMP IS GOING OUT; CHECKED THE FLUIDS AND THEY ARE FINE. I DONT HAVE THE MONEY TO GET EITHER OF THOSE PROBLEMS FIXED RIGHT NOW. OH, DID I MENTION MY ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS? MY WINDOWS ARE TEMPERAMENTAL AND DON'T ALWAYS GO DOWN WHEN I WANT THEM TOO. I WAS TOLD THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE ABOUT $500, MAYBE MORE, TO GET ELECTRICAL WORK DONE. I WILL LIKELY NEVER BY ANOTHER NISSAN AGAIN AFTER THIS ONE!

I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AT 90,000 MILES USED. THIS AFFECTED MY SPEED CONTROL AND ALL RELATED SYSTEMS.THE RADIATOR WAS REPLACED ALSO DUE TO THE CONTAMINATION. THIS HAS AFFECTED MY COOLING AND HEATING SYSTEM AND ALL RELATED SYSTEMS.THIS COST MY EXTENDED WARRANTY COMPANY AROUND $2,900+ (GLAD I WAS SMART ENOUGH TO PURCHASE THIS WARRANTY), HOWEVER IT COST ME MY DEDUCTIBLE OF $200.00. ON FEBRUARY 12, 2016 I DROPPED MY NISSAN OFF FOR A FOLLOW-UP REPAIR TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE TIMING CHAIN ASSEMBLY AFTER GOING IN FOR A SIMPLE ALIGNMENT EARLIER (WHICH WAS A WASTE OF MONEY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE A CAMPER KIT IN ORDER FOR YOUR ALIGNMENT TO BE 100%, $249.00 OUT-OF-POCKET). THIS CAUSED ME TO HAVE TO BUY A BRAND NEW SET OF TIRES OUT-OF-POCKET WHICH CAME WITH A FREE ALIGNMENT AS A SPECIAL, OTHERWISE I WOULD'VE RE-PAYED FOR ANOTHER ALIGNMENT. HEADQUARTERS NISSAN OF COLUMBUS,GA NEVER INFORMED ME OF THE TIMING CHAIN ISSUES WITH THESE SUVS! THIS RESULTED IN PERFORMANCE ISSUES. AGAIN MY EXTENDED WARRANTY WILL PAY AROUND $1,800 TO NISSAN FOR THE REPAIRS AND ME A $200.00 DEDUCTIBLE. I HAVE RUN OUT OF GAS IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC ON THE HIGHWAY IN ATLANTA,GA DURING RUSH HOUR BEFORE BECAUSE MY GAS GAUGE OR INDICATOR OR SOMETHING DOESN'T READ OR IS INACCURATE. I ALSO HEAR NOISE FROM THE TIRES OR SOMETHING WHEN I ROLL OVER SPEED BUMPS, ACCELERATE OR BANK LEFT OR RIGHT WITH BAD, HARD STEERING. THE COOLING AND HEATING SYSTEM HAS NOT BLOWN AIR AT TIMES AND SOMETIMES I HAVE TO DEPRESS THE GAS PETAL WHILE IDLING TO HEAT UP AIR THAT HAS GONE COLD. WHEN THE A/C DOES THIS I TURN OFF THE A/C AND LET THE WINDOWS DOWN, PRESSING THE GAS PETAL DOES NOT WORK. NISSAN SAYS THEY CAN'T FIND A PROBLEM WITH THIS SYSTEM WHEN DIAGNOSING VEHICLE?!",

GOT 4 MECHANICS AND THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP TO CHECK ALL THIS OUT AND THEY ALL CONCLUDED THE COOLANT OVERFLOW TANK WAS FILTHY, STINKS- NOT THE SWEET SMELL- SMELLED BURNT AND RUSTY.  THE VALVES WERE BLOATED AND RADIATOR CAP SEAL WAS LOOSE.  LOW ON COOLANT, HIGH IN WATER.  TRANSMISSION AND RADIATOR NEEDS TO BE FLUSHED AND CHECKED FOR 'SLUDGE'!  THE DEALERSHIP'S ASSOCIATE, [XXX] , ASSURED ME THE 2008 PATHFINDER HAD BEEN SERVICED AND ALL FLUIDS CHECKED AND FILLED.  THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND THE 4 MECHANICS ALL STATED THAT 'NO SERVICE OR FLUIDS WERE CHECKED!'  IF IT HAD BEEN, THE DEALERSHIP WOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THIS TRANSMISSION ISSUE!  THE COOLANT FROM THE RADIATOR IS MIXING WITH THE TRANSMISSION FLUID IN THE TRANSMISSION, CAUSING A MILKY- SLUDGE.  NO ONE CAN CONVINCE ME THAT THIS DEALERSHIP, INTEGRITY CHEVROLET, IN CHATT, TN, DID NOT KNOW OF THIS ISSUE- IT IS A VERY COMMON ISSUE WITH THE NISSAN PATHFINDERS, XTERRAS AND FRONTIERS YEARS 2006-2010.  ANY GOOD ASSOCIATE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THIS ISSUE- IN ORDER TO SELL THIS AUTOMOBILE HONESTLY!  [XXX] , TO WHOM I HAVE KNOWN FOR OVER 20 YEARS, SCREWED ME OVER AND SAW AN UNKNOWING, INNOCENT WOMAN COMING HIS WAY!  I HAD TO BE A GOOD JOKE THAT DAY.

HE LOOKED FURTHER INTO THE ISSUE SINCE I TOLD HIM THAT I DON'T ACTUALLY NOTICE A PROBLEM WITH MY FUEL GAUGE.

SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO HAVE ERRORS WITH THEIR FUEL GAUGE AND OTHER DON'T, HOWEVER THE RESULTING ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH A MALFUNCTION OF THE FUEL SYSTEM WHICH IS CAUSING THE PROBLEM.  NISSAN IS WELL AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND THERE IS A RECALL FOR CERTAIN 2006 AND 2008 XTERRA AND PATHFINDER VEHICLES.  WHEN I CONTACTED THE NISSAN #800, I WAS TOLD THAT MY VIN DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR ANY RECALLS---IN SPITE OF THE COMPANY KNOWING ABOUT THE ISSUE, ISSUING A RECALL FOR THE ISSUE ON THE SAME YEAR AND MODEL OF MY VEHICLE AND MY EXPERIENCING THAT EXACT ISSUE.      MY FAMILY HAS BEEN HIT VERY HARD BY THIS ECONOMY LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

INCIDENT OUTLINE:  I WAS DRIVING ON THE 2 LANE PORTION OF THE TRANS-CANADA HIGHWAY #1 WEST OF CHILLIWACK AND HAD FUELED UP ABOUT TWO HOURS EARLIER. I WATCHED THE FUEL GAUGE, MPG AND DTE READINGS TO ROUGHLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF FUEL REMAINING AND THE RANGE TO BE EXPECTED FROM THE REMAINING FUEL, WHEN THE GAUGES WERE ACTUALLY WORKING FOR A BRIEF TIME. THE FUEL GAUGE HAD SEEMINGLY PROPERLY SHOWN THE DTE AND FUEL LEVEL BUT AT +/- 5/8 OF A TANK IT DROPPED TO ZERO AND THE DTE READINGS WENT FLAT LINE. THIS HAS BECOME A USUAL SITUATION WITH THE FUEL GAUGE ISSUE AND MY ESTIMATES WERE THAT I HAD SUFFICIENT FUEL TO REACH THE NEXT GAS STATION PULLOUT FROM THE FREEWAY BUT I WAS TERRIBLY WRONG.  I WAS PULLING A TRAILER AND HAD MY WIFE, SON AND HIS FRIEND WITH ME RETURNING FROM A WEEKEND AT OUR CABIN. WE WERE TRAVELING @ +/- 60 MPH IN THE FAST LANE AS THERE WAS SLOWER TRAFFIC IN THE CURB LANE WHEN THE TRUCK?S ENGINE STOPPED, I WAS OUT OF FUEL! I QUICKLY ASSESSED THE OPTIONS, PUT MY RIGHT HAND TURN SIGNAL ON AND STARTING EASING INTO THE CURB LANE DISPLACING THE VEHICLE BESIDE ME. I WAS ABLE TO MANEUVER THE TRUCK INTO THE CURB LANE UNDER THE MOMENTUM IT HAD WITHOUT INCIDENT BUT NOT WITHOUT TREMENDOUS STRESS AND 2 NEAR MISSES WITH OTHER VEHICLES. EVENTUALLY I COASTED ONTO THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY AND CAME TO A STOP SAFELY WITHOUT POWER. IT WAS EXTREMELY CLOSE AND A SCENARIO I DO NOT WANT TO SEE PLAYED OUT AGAIN.  NISSAN HAS DECLINED THIS REQUEST AND SHOWN MORAL CONTEMPT FOR A PROBLEM THAT I HAVE DEMONSTRATED THROUGH , TELEPHONE CONVERSATIONS, IMAGES AND TEXT.  *TR",

AFTER 2 HOURS, THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO ME WITH A RECEIPT INDICATING THAT THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED.  THERE WAS A STRONG GAS ODOR WHEN I STARTED THE CAR.  I ASSUMED THAT THIS WAS PROBABLY NATURAL SINCE THE REPAIRS WERE RELATED TO THE FUEL SYSTEM.  HOWEVER, LATER THAT DAY, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  THIS WAS THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME THAT THIS LIGHT CAME ON SINCE I ACQUIRED THE VEHICLE IN APRIL 2008.  I DECIDED THAT ON MONDAY MORNING I WILL RETURN THE VEHICLE TO NISSAN.  HOWEVER, ON SUNDAY AROUND MIDDAY, MY SON TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE SERVICE STATION TO  PURCHASE GAS.  THE NEXT EVENT THAT HAPPENED WAS ALARMING.  ALL THE GAS THAT MY SON ADDED TO THE VEHICLE LEAKED OUT ON THE GROUND.  APPARENTLY, THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN SOMEHOW MANAGED TO CREATE A HOLE SOMEWHERE IN THE FUEL SYSTEM/GAS TANK.  THE VEHICLE HAD TO BE TOWED TO NISSAN FOR REPAIRS AND THE REPAIRS ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON MONDAY 5/3/2010.  THIS SITUATION COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT OR EVEN DEATH TO MY SON.  I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THE INDIVIDUAL WHO PERFORMED THE REPAIRS WAS A NISSAN TRAINED AND CERTIFIED TECHNICIAN OR NOT.  HOWEVER, IT IS WORTHY OF NOTE THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS DEFICIENCY IN EXISTENCE AT THE NISSAN LOCATION.  IT IS MY HOPE AND EXPECTATION THAT AN INVESTIGATION BE MADE INTO THE TYPE AND QUALIFICATIONS OF THE SERVICE PERSONNEL AND THE SERVICE ADVISOR AND THEIR BUSINESS PRACTICES AT THIS LOCATION. I AM CONVINCED THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE FULLY AWARE THAT THEY WERE RETURNING TO ME A DEFECTIVE VEHICLE THAT COULD HAVE HAD CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES.
