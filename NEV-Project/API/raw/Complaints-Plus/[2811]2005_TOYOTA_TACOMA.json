AS YOU MAY BE AWARE, TACOMAS HAVE BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS IN THE STATES WITH HARSH WINTERS, AND WITH CORROSIONS OF THE FRAME FROM ROAD SALT.  THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN SO EVIDENT THAT TOYOTA HAS ADMITTED TO NOT HAVING ADEQUATE CORROSION RESISTANT PROTECTION.    THE FIRST TIME I BECAME AWARE OF THIS ISSUE WAS AT THE END OF JUNE 2016. I CALLED MY TOYOTA DEALER ABOUT TWO OTHER RECALLS AND INQUIRED ABOUT THE FRAME ISSUE AS WELL.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THAT THE FRAME IN FACT HAD A 'LIMITED SERVICE CAMPAIGN' ISSUED BY TOYOTA WHICH EXPIRED MARCH 31, 2016.  HE SAID TO BRING IN MY TRUCK FOR THE OTHER TWO RECALLS (ONE WAS FOR THE LEAF SPRING) AND HE WOULD INSPECT THE FRAME (SEE PAGE 2 OF SERVICE INVOICE).  AFTER INSPECTION, THE TECHNICIAN SAID HE DID NOT THINK THE TRUCK WOULD HOLD UP IN AN ACCIDENT.  I CALLED TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE, IN CALIFORNIA, AND ASKED FOR THEIR HELP AND EXPLAINED THE SITUATION ABOVE.  THEY GAVE ME A CASE NUMBER (1607110805) AND SAID THEY WOULD GET BACK TO ME.  WHEN I RECEIVED THE CALL BACK, THEY DECLINED MY REQUEST DO TO MISSING THE DEADLINE.  IF THIS PROBLEM IS A KNOWN SITUATION WITH TACOMAS (ENOUGH FOR A 'LIMITED SERVICE CAMPAIGN'), ONE WOULD THINK TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS, THEY WOULD SEND A CERTIFIED LETTER.    NOT ONLY IS MY SAFETY IN JEOPARDY, BUT I CANNOT EVEN TRADE MY VEHICLE IN FOR ONE THAT WILL ENSURE MY SAFETY DUE TO FINANCIAL LIMITATIONS AND THE DECREASED VALUE OF MY TRUCK NOT HAVING THIS ISSUE RESOLVED.  IF TOYOTA REALLY CARES ABOUT THEIR PRODUCT AND THE SAFETY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS, THEY WOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND REPLACE MY TRUCK FRAME (ESPECIALLY SINCE ONE OF THEIR OWN CERTIFIED MECHANICS DETERMINED THE TRUCK HAS BEEN EFFECTED BY THE VERY SAME CAMPAIGN).  THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO READ THIS AND HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HELP ME RESOLVE THIS ISSUE.  *TR",

I CONTACTED TOYOTA AND OPENED A CASE WITH THEM. THEY DID COME OUT WITH A LIMITED SERVICE CAMPAIGN (LSC - E0D TO ADDRESS THIS KNOWN RUST ISSUE FOR CERTAIN TRUCK IN 20 NORTHERN STATES. AFTER FOLLOWING UP, I WAS TOLD YES TOYOTA KNOWS I HAVE THE ISSUE BUT MY VIN ISN'T PART OF THE LSC. I WAS TOLD TO CONTACT A DEALERSHIP AND THE FRAME COULD BE FIXED AS LONG AS I PAID FOR IT. I HAVE CONTACTED SEVERAL LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIPS AND THEY ALL TELL ME THEY DON'T FIX FRAMES WITH THIS ISSUE. THE TRUCK ONLY HAS 72K ON IT AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN DRIVEN ON THE BEACH OR TAKEN OFF ROAD. I USE THE TRUCK TO GET TO WORK IN SNOW STORMS AND WEEKEND PROJECTS. I ALWAYS GET THE TRUCK WASHED AS I KNOW HOW BAD SALT CAN DAMAGE A VEHICLE. I FIND IT AMAZING THAT THERE IS A LSC BUT TOYOTA IS UNABLE TO TELL ME HOW MANY VEHICLES ARE BEING FIXED UNDER IT AND THEY ARE ALSO UNWILLING TO ASSIST IN GETTING THE ISSUE FIXED OR THAT REFERRING ME TO LOCAL DEALERSHIPS ISN'T HELPING AT ALL SINCE THEY DON'T FIX THIS ISSUE..

THE 2 LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIPS WERE NOT INTERESTED IN REPLACING THEM, AS MY TACOMA HAD 50,000 MILES ON IT (STANDARD WARRANTY EXPIRED AT 36,000).

AFTER RESEARCHING IT, TOYOTA HAD ISSUED A PRESS RELEASE ACKNOWLEDGING A PROBLEM WITH THE \"SPIRAL CABLE\" AND INDICATED THEY WERE GATHERING THE PARTS AND WOULD SEND LETTERS TO OWNERS.  I NEVER RECEIVED A LETTER AND AFTER INQUIRING, MY VIN WAS EXCLUDED FROM THE RECALL CAMPAIGN.  AFTER RESEARCHING A BIT MORE, IT APPEARS MANY TACOMA OWNERS HAVE THE SAME ISSUE AND WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE RECALL CAMPAIGN.    THE AIRBAG DASHBOARD LIGHT NOW ILLUMINATES CONTINUOUSLY.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID IT WOULD BE $106 TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM (WE ALL KNOW IT'S A SPIRAL CABLE ISSUE) AND FROM ALL ACCOUNTS, THE SPIRAL CABLE REPLACEMENT COST IS NORTH OF $500 (EVEN THOUGH TOYOTA'S PRESS RELEASE INDICATED IT IS A 30 MINUTE FIX).  BY THE WAY, THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THE AIRBAG WOULD NOT DEPLOY IN THE EVENT OF A FRONTAL CRASH AS LONG AS THE AIRBAG DASHBOARD LIGHT IS ILLUMINATED.  THE COST OF REPAIR IS OUT OF RANGE FOR MOST AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THE DEALERSHIP HAD LITTLE CONCERN FOR THE SAFETY OF THE OCCUPANTS.    THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND THE NHTSA IS FAILING TO ANALYZE THE DATA AND MAKE A COMPELLING CASE TO TOYOTA TO EXPAND THE AFFECTED RANGE OF VINS INCLUDED IN THE RECALL CAMPAIGN.  IT IS YET ANOTHER BLACK EYE FOR TOYOTA FOR DEMONSTRATING A LACK OF CONCERN FOR A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT COULD END UP SERIOUSLY INJURING OR KILLING A VEHICLE OCCUPANT, UNNECESSARILY.  GIVEN THE RECENT PUBLICITY OF THE FINE LEVIED AGAINST TOYOTA AND THE GRILLING GM IS NOW TAKING, YOU WOULD EXPECT THE AUTOMAKERS TO STEP UP THEIR GAME.  MY OBSERVATION IS THAT THEY SIMPLY DON'T CARE.  IF NHTSA IS NOT FORCING THEIR HANDS ON SAFETY ISSUES, IT'S OBVIOUS CAR MANUFACTURERS NO LONGER HAVE INCENTIVE TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

THE JOINT IS OPEN TO THE ELEMENTS AND HAS NO PROTECTIVE BOOT OVER IT. THERE IS NO MAINTENANCE PROCEDURE FROM TOYOTA FOR THE JOINT. THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND COULD CAUSE A CRASH.

THE FRAMES ARE A POOR DESIGN, HAVE NO PROTECTIVE COATING AND ARE MADE OF INFERIOR METAL. A SIMPLE INTERNET SEARCH FOR \"TACOMA FRAME RUST\" WILL SHOW PLENTY OF HORROR STORIES OF FRAMES LITERALLY RUSTING AWAY FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE TRUCK. THE OLDEST 2ND GENERATION TACOMAS (2005 PRODUCTION YEAR) ARE NOW 9 YEARS OLD, A FRAME ON A 9 YEAR OLD VEHICLE HAVING RUST ISSUES IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD.

TOYOTA DID THE RIGHT THING WITH THE 1ST GENERATION TACOMAS THAT HAD THIS ISSUE. THEY ISSUED RECALLS AND BOUGHT BACK TRUCKS.

I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP TO EXAMINE MY BRAKING AND ABS SYSTEM.  THEY COULD NOT FIND ANY PROBLEMS.  IF THE ABS IS AT FAULT, THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2010 AND THE FIRST TIME ON DRY ROAD.  THE SPECIFICATIONS FOR MY VEHICLE SAY THAT IT ONLY TAKES 126 FEET TO MAKE A STOP.    THE VEHICLE WAS TOTALED AND SOLD BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY.  THEY WILL HOLD IT FOR ONLY 4 DAYS FOR INVESTIGATION.  THE VEHICLE WAS RECALLED AND SERVICED FOR SIMILAR PROBLEMS IN THE PAST.  I CONTACTED THE TOYOTA REGIONAL OFFICE ON 02/27/2014, BUT THEY WILL NOT DO AN INVESTIGATION.  *TR",

I MOVED TO WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA IN JUNE AND ON MY TRIP UP I NOTICED THE TRUCK WAS VIBRATING/SHIMMING.  I TOOK MY TRUCK IN FOR SERVICE TO BARREL TOYOTA IN CRANBERRY, PA TO CHECK IT OUT.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN NOTICED IT THEN AND TOOK SOME PICTURES OF THE RUSTED AREAS.  I MADE MY FIRST CALL TO TOYOTA AT THIS TIME.  NOT MORE THAN A MONTH LATER I HAD TO HAVE A BARRING REPLACED AT GUYS SERVICE STATION, KNOB HILL, PA.

WHEN I CALLED TOYOTA GLOBAL I WAS TOLD THAT, ALTHOUGH THEY HAD RECALLED TACOMAS UP TO 2004, THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO FOR ME.  ALL THAT THEY COULD DO WAS ASSIGN ME A CASE NUMBER.  I RETURNED TO BARREL TOYOTA TO SEE IF THEY COULD OFFER ANY HELP OR MAYBE A TRADE IN FOR ANOTHER VEHICLE.  THEY REFUSED.  I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THERE THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH TOYOTA TRUCKS AND WHILE HE COULD DO NOTHING FOR ME, HE COULD RECOMMEND SOMEONE TO WELD IT.  HE ALSO INFORMED ME AT THIS TIME THAT I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET MY TRUCK INSPECTED AFTER A WINTER HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA.  NOW I'M NOT THE SMARTEST PERSON BUT EVEN I KNOW THAT THE FRAMES OF VEHICLES ARE DESIGNED TO COLLAPSE A CERTAIN WAY IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT AND IF YOU WELD IT, IT WOULD COMPROMISE THE INTEGRITY OF THE DESIGN.

FOR MY TRUCK I HEARD A NOISE COMING FROM THE ENGINE ON 12/24/2012 AND TOOK INTO A DEALER ON 12/26/2012. THEY SAID IT WAS  THE FAN HITTING THE FAN SHROAD THEY SAID THEY FIXED IT. I STARTED HEARING THE NOISE AGAIN AND HAD TO TAKE IT IN ON 1/5/2013...THEY FIRST SAID IT WAS MY MOTOR MOUNTS AND WOULD NEED TO ORDER THE PART..WHEN THEY WERE GOING TO INSTALL THE PART THEY NOTICE A CRACK IN THE FRAME WHERE IT CONNECTS TO THE MOTOR MOUNT. THEY SAID THERE WAS NO OTHER SIGNS IF DAMAGE ANY WHERE AND DID NOT KNOW HOW THAT HAPPENED...MEANING THE FRAME FAILED FROM THE TORQUE OF THE ENGINE.. THEY ADVISE I WOULD NEED TO GET NEW FRAME ($10,000)...I CALLED TOYOTA AND ADVISE THEY WOULD NOT ASSIST.  *TR",

I GAVE IT A QUICK PUNCH TO AVOID A COLLISION WHEN I FELT MY RPM'S KEPT CLIMBING AS I WAS NO LONGER ON THE PEDAL. I PANICKED AND TRIED TO APPLY THE BRAKES TO NO RESPONSE, SO I TAPPED THE SHIFTER INTO NEUTRAL. AT THIS POINT MY CAR IS STILL ACCELERATING IN REDLINE. FINALLY, THE CAR SNAPS OUT OF IT AND I HAVE CONTROL AGAIN. I SLOW DOWN, SHIFT BACK INTO D AND CONTINUE MY COMMUTE TO SCHOOL.    IN THE PAST, I HAVE NOTICED A FEW TIMES THERE HAVE BEEN A SLIGHT LUNGE IN ACCELERATION JUST AFTER THE TRANSMISSION SWITCHES GEARS. I LOVE MY TACOMA. I HAVE BEEN IN DENIAL AND HAVE BEEN HOPING, WISHING THAT THERE ISN'T A PROBLEM.

I HAVE LOGGED MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS , BUT NEVER HEARD A WORD BACK FROM ANYONE. IF I CHOSE TO NOT HAVE IT FIXED, WHAT WOULD OF HAPPENED IF I HAD BEEN IN A HEAD ON CRASH WITH NO AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY, THAT'S WHY I PURCHASED THE TACOMA, FOR IT'S APPARENT SAFETY. *TR",

AFTER RETURNING FROM VACATION I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO LARRY MILLER TOYOTA IN PEORIA, ARIZONA AND COMPLAINED ABOUT THE PROBLEM WE EXPERIENCED. THE DEALERS EMPLOYEES INDICATED THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD SUCH A THING AND THEN COPIED THE OWNERS MANUAL HIGHLIGHTING THE PART THAT SAYS TO DISENGAGE THE CRUISE CONTROL WHEN GOING UPHILLS.  I HAVE BEEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE FOR FIVE YEARS NOW AND HAVE LEARNED TO TURN OFF THE CRUISE GOING UPHILLS BUT HAVE STILL EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM THREE OTHER TIMES WHEN I WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF THE GRADE WE WERE ON AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  I HAVE OWNED SEVERAL VEHICLE WITH CRUISE CONTROL IN MY LIFE AND HAVE NEVER HAD AN ISSUE WITH CRUISE CONTROL GOING UPHILLS EXCEPT THE POTENTIAL OF THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTING UP AND DOWN FROM OVERDRIVE TO ALLOW THE VEHICLE TO MAINTAIN THE SPEED SET. WE ALSO OWN A 2000 TOYOTA AVALON WHICH I DRIVE ON VACATIONS  AND IF THERE IS ANY ISSUE I TURN OFF THE OVERDRIVE AND IT DOES FINE.

TRUCK FORCEFULLY LURCHES FORWARD WITH TIRES SCREECHING. CALLED DEALERSHIP TO NOTIFY THEM. WAS SUGGESTED THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE FLOOR MAT.

AS BRAKES ARE APPLIED TO STOP, THE TRUCK MAKES A LOUD REVVING SOUND AND IS VERY FORCEFULLY LURCHING FORWARD WHILE THE TIRES ARE MAKING A VERY LOUD SCREECHING SOUND. 4TH INCIDENT-WHILE STOPPED IN TRAFFIC WITH MY FOOT ALREADY FIRMLY ON THE BRAKE PEDAL WAITING FOR THE TRAFFIC TO CHANGE THE TRUCK VERY SUDDENLY LUNGES FORWARD WHILE TIRES ARE MAKING A SCREECHING SOUND.

I HIT THE BRAKE AND IT WOULD NOT STOP, SO IN MY CONFUSION, I THREW IT INTO DRIVE AND IT LURCHED FORWARD EVEN WITH MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE.  THE WHEELS WERE JUMPING AND THE TRUCK WAS INCHING FORWARD.

PERSONALLY, I BELIEVE IT HAS TO DO WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL OR WHATEVER WOULD MAKE THE ACCELERATOR SUDDENLY PULL ITSELF TO THE FLOOR MAKING THE TRUCK TAKE OFF! I AM NO MECHANIC, BUT I HAVE BEEN A DRIVER FOR 35 YEARS AND THIS HAD NEVER HAPPENED TO ME IN ANY OTHER VEHICLE. MY TRUCK HAS ABOUT 30K MILES ON IT.  IT'S BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT, (SOME RAN A RED LIGHT AND THE CAR THEY HIT CRASHED INTO MY PARKED TRUCK), BUT MOST OF THE WORK WAS BODY WORK AND IT WAS RECENTLY MOVED TO A MORE HUMID CLIMATE, RATHER THAN MOSTLY DRY SAN DIEGO.  IT?S A 4X4, DOUBLE CAB AND OTHERWISE AND WELL RUNNING MACHINE.  I LEASED IT FOR THE FIRST 3 YEARS AND JUST PURCHASED IT FROM THE LEASING AGENCY BECAUSE I HAD VERY LOW MILEAGE AND IT WAS IN GREAT SHAPE. NOW I AM CONCERNED THAT NO ONE IS GOING TO TAKE ME SERIOUSLY.  MY PLAN BY WEEKS-END IF I DON?T HEAR BACK SOMETHING POSITIVE, IS TO GO TO THE LOCAL AND THEN PERHAPS NATIONAL PRESS.  A STORY WAS DONE OUT OF NASHVILLE LAST OCTOBER ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM OTHER TACOMA OWNERS ARE HAVING.  I HAVE CONTACTED THEM WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR STORY AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

THE TACOMA PRESENTLY HAS 15,800 MILES ON IT AND HAS BEEN IMPECCABLY MAINTAINED.  SINCE THE FIRST TIME I DROVE THIS VEHICLE THE ENGINE \"RACED\" WHEN STARTED UP.

I WAS NEVER COMFORTABLE WITH THE WAY IT SOUNDED WHEN STARTED UP, HOWEVER, SOMETIMES IT WAS QUIETER. NONETHELESS I FELT THAT I HAD A SAFE, DEPENDABLE VEHICLE AND ALL THE \"REPORTS\" WRITTEN ABOUT IT INDICATED THIS WAS THE CASE.

ABOUT THREE MILES FROM HOME, ON ROUTE 212, THE ENGINE SURGED AND REVVED UP SO INTENSELY THAT IT TERRIFIED ME!  THE NOISE AND SPEED WERE OVERWHELMING.  I KNEW IN A NANOSECOND THAT I HAD TO PULL OVER AND TURN THE ENGINE OFF.  THERE WAS A CULVERT AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND I KNEW THE VEHICLE WOULD TURN OVER IF I TRIED TO EXIT THERE.

AFTER BRINGING THE TRUCK IN AND MANY PHONE CALLS AND TRIPS TO THE DEALERSHIP, I WAS TOLD AFTER TWO WEEKS, BY THE MANAGER OF THE DEALERSHIP THAT I NEEDED TO CALL MY INSURANCE COMPANY.  THIS WAS SO MY INSURANCE WOULD PAY FOR THE DAMAGES.  THIS IS TOTALLY WRONG.  I COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR EVEN WORSE!  IF THEY WOULD HAVE CHECKED MY VEHICLE, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED UNFIT TO DRIVE.  I AM NOT A MECHANIC.  NOW THE DEALERSHIP WANTS MY $500.00 DEDUCTIBLE PAYMENT.  YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!    I MUST SAY, I AM VERY SORRY THAT I BOUGHT A TOYOTA VEHICLE.  IF I HAD TO DO OVER AGAIN, I WOULD NOT DO SO.  THIS IS A TERRIBLE WAY TO TREAT A CUSTOMER. *JB",

THE TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN, AT TIMES, EXCESSIVELY DIFFICULT TO SHIFT AND THE JUDDER HAS BEEN, ON RARE OCCASIONS, EVIDENT IN SECOND GEAR. BOTH PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN INTERMITTENT SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS DELIVERED.  ON THE MORNING OF JULY 28TH, THE JUDDER PROBLEM WAS PARTICULARLY BAD AND WAS EVIDENT WITH EVERY START IN FIRST GEAR AND SOMETIMES IN SECOND GEAR. IT BECAME MORE VIOLENT WITH EACH START AND AT ONE POINT, AFTER THE CLUTCH PEDAL WAS FULLY RELEASED, THERE WAS A SUDDEN SLIP OF THE CLUTCH DISC FOLLOWED BY SUDDEN FRICTION. THIS RESULTED IN LOSS OF TRACTION OF THE DRIVE WHEELS AND SUBSEQUENT TOTAL LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. CONTROL WAS REGAINED RELATIVELY QUICKLY BY DEPRESSING THE CLUTCH PEDAL TO REMOVE DRIVE POWER FROM THE WHEELS AND A CATASTROPHIC EVENT WAS NARROWLY AVOIDED.    TOYOTA HAS ATTEMPTED REPAIR OF THIS JUDDER PROBLEM THREE TIMES INCLUDING A COMPLETE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY REPLACEMENT AT 6,500 MILES, BUT NOW CLAIMS THAT THE VEHICLE OPERATES NORMALLY. THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO A DEALER SHORTLY AFTER THE INCIDENT DESCRIBED ABOVE AND THE SHOP FOREMAN SAID AGAIN, THE VEHICLE WAS OPERATING NORMALLY. HE ALSO CLAIMED THAT PER TOYOTA'S DIRECTIVE, HE IS NOT TO KEEP THE VEHICLE UNLESS HE HAS PRIOR APPROVAL FROM TOYOTA TO DO SO.  *JB",

THIS IS NOT A QUESTION BUT A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT I AND OTHER PREVIOUS AND CURRENT TACOMA OR TRUCK OWNERS CONSIDER A DESIGN FLAW AND POTENTIAL SAFETY HAZARD.    I'M HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FRONT END METAL SUSPENSION KNUCKLE THAT SITS A 1/2 INCH AWAY FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE TIRE.  THIS IS ON THE 05 TACOMA CREW CAB 4X4 SHORTBED W/TRD, TOW PKG (OC)OPTIONS.      -THIS CAUSES ISSUE        THIS COULD CAUSE FLEXING OF THE TIRE DURING NORMAL ON-ROAD AND OFF-ROAD BUMPS CAUSING THE TIRE TO FLEX AND POSSIBLY RUB AGAINST THE SUSPENSION KNUCKLE.  THIS SITUATION IS COMPOUNDED IF A TIRE RUNS A LITTLE LOW ON AIR PRESSURE AND COULD CAUSE A PREMATURE CUT TIRE OR BLOWOUT.    ANOTHER UNRELATED ITEM--THE NEW 05/06 TACOMA REAR SUSPENSION BOTTOMS OUT TO EASY.  DURING A RECENT HUNTING TRIP OCT 05 IN COLORADO.  I HAD MY HUNTING GEAR DISTRIBUTED EVENLY IN THE CREW CAB AND THE SHORTBED (APPX 100PDS IN THE BACK SEAT, ONLY MYSELF 220PD IN DRIVER SEAT, AND APPX 400 PDS IN THE TRUCK BED.  THE TRUCK BED HAD APPX 275 PDS BETWEEN THE WHEEL WELL AND TAILGATE AND OTHER 100-150 MAX IN FRONT OF BED EVENLY DESTROYED.  THE TRUCK BOTTOMED OUT QUITE EASILY ON FAIRLY MINOR RUTS ON DIRT ROADS AND ON HIGHWAY DITCHES THAT WERE ONLY MINOR SLOPED AND SHOULD NOT HAVE CAUSE THE TRUCK TO BOTTOM OUT.  THE TRUCK WAS NOT CLOSE TO THE 50% WEIGHT LIMIT AND THE REAR OF THE TRUCK STANDING STILL WAS NOT SAGGING MUCH AT ALL FROM THE WEIGHT.  I WAS REALLY SHOCKED THAT IT SOUNDED LIKE THE TRUCK BOTTOMED OUT ON MINOR SLOW SPEED RUTS AND DURING HIGHWAY ROAD HUMPS OR DIPS.  THIS NEVER HAPPENED WITH MY 95 OR 98 TACOMA UNLESS I HAD 75% PLUS OF THE BED CARRY LIMIT MET.  I THINK YOU NEED TO BEEF UP OR RETEST/REDESIGN THE SPRINGS AND/OR SHOCKS TO MEET THE NEW TRUCKS WEIGHT AND LOAD CARRY CAPABILITIES BETTER.      BILLY ARMOUR.  *NM",

THAT THEY WERE HAVING THIS TROUBLE WITH ALL THE NEW TRUCKS BECAUSE OF A CHANGE IN DESIGN THIS YEAR. THIS PROBLEM MAKES IT UNSAFE TO TRAVEL ON INTERSTATES BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GO OVER 45 WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT VIBRATION.  A FACTORY REP. DROVE OUR TRUCK AND ACTUALLY SAID THERE WAS NO VIBRATION AT 85 MPH.  HE DID FEEL THE VIBRATION AT LOWER SPEEDS BUT SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO ABOUT IT.
