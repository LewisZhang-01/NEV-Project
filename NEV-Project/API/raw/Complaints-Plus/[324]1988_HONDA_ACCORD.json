I WAS REALLY HOPING TO AVOID A LOCAL NEWS STORY FOR THIS ISSUE, BUT I WILL GIVE THIS ONE LAST CHANCE BEFORE I GO THAT ROUTE.    MY 1988 HONDA ACCORD LXI HATCHBACK HAS AN ISSUE WITH THE FRONT SEAT BELT RETRACTORS.  THE DEALER REPLACED THE DRIVER SIDE ONE ABOUT 3 YEARS AGO.  NOW THE ONE IN THE FRONT/PASSENGER SIDE HAS FAILED AND THE SEAT BELT IS HANGING ALL OF THE WAY OUT OF THE DOOR.  THE LOCAL HONDA DEALER IS MORE INTERESTED IN SELLING NEW CARS THAN TAKING CARE OF OLD ONES THAT ARE STILL OUT THERE AND RUNNING.  THE SEAT BELTS ARE WARRANTEED FOR THE LIFE OT FHE CAR.  THE DEALER KEEPS BRUSHING ME OFF AND I AM SICK OF IT.  I CAN'T HAVE ANY PASSENGERS IN THE FRONT OF MY CAR BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.  THE DEALER TELLS ME THAT THEY CAN'T GET THE SEAT BELTS ANYWHERE.  THAT IS STRANGE OF THEM TO SAY THAT BECAUSE I WENT ON LINE AND HAVE FOUND THEM FOR AROUND $100 EACH.  THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUE, SO I AM REACHING OUT TO SOMEONE THAT CAN RESOLVE THIS.  PLEASE HELP!!!  2 PICTURES ARE INCLUDED WITH THIS COMPLAINT.",
