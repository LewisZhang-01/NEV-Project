I have changed out the radio, 3 speed sensors, and now am having more issues with different symptoms.  For example my epc light is no and my check engine is on along with the other typical light i have seen with my speed sensor issues.  I can not confidently pass any cars because the car stalls at 3000 rpms.  I consider this car a safety issue on the road and i do not want this car anymore because i do not know what hidden failures will appear later on after fixing these.",

I have done some research and talked to many people and found out that wheel bearings should not go bad on a car with 60K miles.   It would be understandable if one went bad due to a defect but both going bad has me quite confused and angry at the cost of these repairs.  I wrote VW about this problem and was told that since the vehicle was no longer under warranty there was nothing they could do. That would be an acceptable answer if wheel bearing failure was to be expected as a normal wear and tear item at 60K miles.  But the fact that this is quite early for them to fail, I feel that VW might have issues with the wheel bearings and that others have experienced the same thing with the Passat.  I thought I would reach out in case others have reached out as well in order to get VW to address this problem.  Thank you.",

As the mechanic had set the incorrect timing interval between services, I went into the menu to attempt to reset the service minder but never got that far as the airbag light came on and all buttons on the steering wheel stopped responding. My husband in the passenger seat instructed me to restart the car and this did not reset any warnings but also showed the ACC: Error, in the display alternating with the Airbag: Error. The dealership wants $ 165 just to plug in the diagnostic reader and won't apply it to a repair and says this car has no open recalls which I am aware of. However, there was an airbag recall including the 2015 year build Passat, but the dealership wants payment to diagnose. When the car is stirred to make a 90 degree left hand turn I can hear a coil in the steering wheel cracking at times. Frequently, the airbag light for the passenger scale stays on but may go out if someone goes to sit in the passenger seat. All seat belts are unlocked at the top, and the receivers for the buckles look fine and nothing is stuck in them. I have not yet lifted the seats to inspect the harnesses but I doubt I will be able to fix anything as I cannot reset the codes anyhow.  Not being able to change the information on the instrument panel from useless Error Messages is distracting. Tell VW to read an airbag fault light for free! This is a safety concern for every passenger and should not be taken advantage of to make a service department money. How can I find out if this model was added to the air bag recalls or is in the process of being added? Honda has a lifetime warranty service for free on all safety restraints. I am surprised that VW does not make safety their highest priority. I'm not certain the Forward Collision Warning is affected but the lanes blink Orange showing me the ACC is not responsive and it's close enough in function to mention just in case it may not work.",

I did not have it checked the first time since I falsely assumed I had done something I had not thought about.  Now, after the third time, I am sure that it is the car and not something I have done.  I have not been back to VW shop yet after this third time. My wife is scared to drive the car now and I am concerned about myself.  I do not think the VW dealer went any further than a test drive and maybe a computer check after the second braking I encountered.  There have been no warning lights or messages on my car dash before or after all three times.  The dash light warning to \"BRAKE!\" did light up as the brakes were applying on their own.

I often drive on the highway with construction with my children so sudden engine shut off is a safety risk.  On 12/18/20, I took my vehicle to the VW dealership for excessive oil consumption, low oil and EPC lights and white smoke out of tailpipe. The technician diagnosed and repaired a blown upper timing gasket. The problems persisted and I dropped off the vehicle at the dealership on 01/19/21. Dealership advised computer update was needed and was performed. Problems persisted and vehicle was dropped off on 01/30/21 and 03/15/21 for oil consumption tests and advised results were in 'acceptable' range for VW. After researching work history on my vehicle, I remembered I took it in while under warranty (under 36k miles) for fuel smell in cabin when using the heater. VW technicians checked fuel lines, injectors and fuel tank but found nothing wrong. After researching this topic on various VW blogs, I found the fuel smell in cabin was caused by failed PCV system in numerous cases. I believe my air oil seperator/PCV was faulty and began to fail while my vehicle was still under warranty. Further internet research revealed  websites and blogs with numerous mentions of failed VW/ Audi PCV systems.
