When traveling on the interstate with adaptive cruise engaged, we came around a bend in the road approaching an entrance ramp. There was a slow moving vehicle on the entrance ramp which was apparently identified by the adaptive cruise system as being in front of our vehicle in the same lane. The adaptive cruise caused our vehicle to brake violently while still in the bend in the road, which in turn caused us to swerve into the next lane where there was a car traveling adjacent, but just behind us. This was a very unexpected series of events, and could have resulted in catastrophic consequences had the adjacent car been any closer at the time. This is a major flaw in the adaptive cruise system. And it is compounded by the fact that the adaptive cruise system cannot be switched over to a manually controlled more traditional cruise system. This is a severe design flaw with the GMC Yukon. Some of this could be remedied by issuing a firmware update that allows the driver to disengage the adaptive cruise and switch to a more traditional cruise control method. But GMC has no interest in providing this update, even with multiple message board threads talking about the dangers of the adaptive cruise control.",
