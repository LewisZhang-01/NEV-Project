I HAD TO PUT 3 TRANSMISSIONS IN THE CAR (IN ABOUT END OF FEBRUARY, AGAIN IN ABOUT 3 WEEKS ANOTHER ONE HAD TO BE PUT IN) I ONLY PAID ABOUT $1,100.00 FOR THE TRANSMISSION AND THE OTHERS WERE COVERED BY THE MECHANICS WARRANTY.  THE TRANSMISSION THAT WAS IN THERE WAS FRIED WHEN THEY SOLD IT TO ME. A RIM HAD TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE IT WAS BENT WHICH COSTED $45.00. I HAD TO REPLACE THE COOLING SYSTEM ($800.00) (JUNE 24 2003) BECAUSE IT WAS NOT WORKING AT ALL. THE ENGINE HAD OVER HEATED CAUSING THE RADIO TO MALFUNCTION.  A/C DOES NOT WORK AT ALL, IT BLOWS HOT AIR.  HEATER WORKS BUT IT TAKES A VERY LONG TIME BEFORE HEAT COMES OUT. IF THE CAR COULD JUST BE REPAINTED BY FORD, I?LL PAY A DEDUCTABLE IF NECESSARY BECAUSE IT IS A VERY NICE CAR AND I LOVE THE WAY IT DRIVES AND HANDLES.

WHILE MANEUVERING AROUND CARS I STOOD FULL WEIGHT (200LBS) ON THE BRAKE PEDAL WITH MINIMAL CHANGE, THE VEHICLE STILL ACCELERATED APPROACHING 90. THE PEDAL WAS NOT STUCK, NOR WAS THE CRUISE CONTROL ON. I HAD TO TURN THE CAR OFF ELIMINATING THE POWER STEERING AND POWER BRAKES WHILE IN TRAFFIC DRIVING OVER 80 MPH. OTHER DRIVERS WERE FORCED TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTIONS. LUCKILY, NO CONTACT BETWEEN VEHICLES OCCURRED. MY CAR CAME TO REST SKIDDING ON GRAVEL OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. NEITHER MYSELF NOR DAUGHTER WERE INJURED. THE CHOKE CABLE LINKAGE ASSEMBLY FAILED CAUSING THE UNCONTROLLED ACCELERATION. *AK",
