We reported the broken handle and asked if it was covered under the factory warranty.  We were told by the local Hyundai Dealer that it was not.  So we paid over $100.00 to have the handle replaced.  Fast forward to January of 2022, I was packing my son's car for him to return to college and the back passenger door handle came off in my hand.  That's two door handles in less than five months.  There was no forced entry.  No yanking or pulling above a normal opening the door process.  My son is unable to access the passenger side of his car and has to crawl across the back seat.  When the front passenger handle fell off, the passenger front seat was unusable.  I have done research online and this seems to be a problem.  Our car is not the first one to have this happen.  I placed a claim with Hyundai Motor America and was guaranteed a call back within 3-5 business days.  I have since placed four more calls in to the customer service line and have yet to hear from anyone regarding fixing this issues.  It has been over two weeks.

They would not cover a rental until at least a diagnosis report came back which they would not begin until 2022. They said the lengthy waitlist for a rental would prevent me from securing a vehicle to use in the meantime. Because I need a functioning car, I had to purchase this out of pocket.

Car starts to smoke and make a loud knocking noise, when checking the oil, it appears to have no oil in the engine at all. Every single time they have changed the oil and replaced it and within a 1,000 miles the oil has completely dissolved in the engine. They performed a consumption test and stated that they did a top engine cleaning for the combustion and that it should not happen again and if it did that they would reach out to Hyundai to start the process of replacing the engine. Took it back at the 1,000 mile mark and they stated that it was fine, but after only a few weeks to a month the car started smoking and knocking again, took it back and yes the engine was bone dry again no oil at all on the dipstick. This vehicle has been in the shop more than I was able to drive it. The oil light keeps jumping on and off and the dealer is aware of this issue and they stated that the manufacturer is aware of this issue as well. But it seems that they are refusing to rectify the issue with a new engine and just keep patching the problem, that I would have to keep taking back every 1,00 miles for a consumption test. The oil ight was present when they sold me the vehicle but the dealership stated that they had performed an oil change and it needed to be reprogrammed but that did not fix the problem.",

WE TOOK THE CELL PHONE OFF OF THIS AREA WHERE IT CHARGES, AND NOTICED THE TOP RUBBER AREA WAS VERY VERY WARM OR HOT TO THE TOUCH.

(2) WHEN DRIVING ON HIGHWAY OR ROAD, WITH NORMAL BEAM HEADLIGHTS, WE NOTICED THAT THE LINE OF DEMARCATION FROM HEADLIGHT TO DARK ROAD WAS VERY CLOSE TO THE FRONT OF THE CAR.  THE REASON GIVEN BY THE MAINTENANCE DEPT WAS THAT THIS WAS SO CARS IN FRONT WOULDN'T BE BLINDED BY THE HEADLIGHT.   TO US, IT SEEMED THAT THE HEADLIGHTS WERE AIMED TOO LOW.  I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE MORE THAN 20 FEET IN FRONT OF MY CAR.  WE WERE TOLD THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE.  ALSO, WHEN MAKING A TURN, THE AREA OPPOSITE THE DIRECTION OF THE TURN IS COMPLETELY DARK BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE HEADLIGHTS WORK ON A TURN.  THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS-SHOULD SOMEONE DECIDE TO WALK THERE OR IF THERE IS AN ANIMAL, I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE ANYTHING.  AGAIN I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.
