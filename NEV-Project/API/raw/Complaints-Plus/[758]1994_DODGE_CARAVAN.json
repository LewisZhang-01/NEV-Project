REGULAR TRANSMISSION SERVICE AND CHECKUP HAS BEEN PERFORMED WITH LAST ONE BEFORE THE FAILURE AT  72456 MILES. NO PROBLEMS WERE FOUND AT THIS SERVICE, OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE TAKEN APPROPRIATE ACTION.   THE FAILURE HAPPENED IN AN OFFICE UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT AND THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE WHEN MY WIFE TRIED TO PARK IT. IT HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIRS. THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED WHILE DRIVING ON A BUSY HIGHWAY OR ON A BUSY STREET AND COULD HAVE BEEN DANGEROUS TO HER SAFETY AND TO OTHER PEOPLE ON THE ROAD.  I RESEARCHED INTO THE ISSUE ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND A  LOT OF  CHRYSLER/DODGE CARAVAN OWNERS WITH SIMILAR PROBLEMS OVER THE YEARS. I EVEN TALKED TO FRIENDS AND PEOPLE I KNOW WHO ARE CARAVAN OWNERS AND SEVERAL TOLD ME IT IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THESE TRANSMISSIONS BUT CHRYSLER HAS FAILED TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM. FAILURES EVEN HAPPEN AT LOWER MILEAGE THAN MY VAN  AND TO OLDER MODELS. REPLACED TRANSMISSIONS ARE ALSO KNOWN TO FAIL WITH LOW MILEAGE IN SEVERAL CASES THAT I CAME ACROSS.

THE DEALER THAT CHECKED THE PROBLEM ON MY VAN FOUND THAT THERE WERE 4 PROBLEMS FOUND INCLUDING WORN OUT CLUTCHES AND HE HAD NO EXPLANATION FOR THE FAILURE.

FAILURE OF THIS PART PREVENTS THE SEATBELT FROM WORKING PROPERLY AND COULD ACTUALLY CAUSE A FATAL ACCIDENT IF THIS FAILURE HAD OCCURRED DURING HIGHWAY DRIVING. WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS PART REPAIRED SINCE FEBRUARY OF 2001. WE WERE TOLD THAT THIS PART NUMBER HAD CHANGED 17 TIMES AND WAS ON BACK ORDER. FINALLY, AFTER HAVING TO RETURN TO THE DEALER TO RE-REPAIR THE AIRCONDITIONER, WE CALLED THE CHRYSERLER MANUFACTURER TO SEE HOW WE COULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THEY INFORMED US THAT THE PART HAD NEVER BEEN ORDERED. NOW THE COST OF THE PART HAS INCREASED FROM $25.00 TO $143.00. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND WE HAVE FOUND NO RECOURSE FOR A SOLUTION. PLEASE ADVISE US OF STEPS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN TO BRING THIS PROBLEM TO THE ATTENTION OF OTHER DODGE CARAVAN OWNERS.  *AK",

I DROVE ANOTHER 20 MILES @ 60 TO 70 MPH WITH NO INDICATION OF PROBLEMS, UNTIL I APPLIED MY BRAKES TO GET OF AT MY HOME EXIT. AT THAT TIME THE CHECK BRAKES FAILURE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR WITH ESSENTIALLY NO STOPPING ACTION. I FINALLY STOPPED THE VEHICLE WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE. UPON INSPECTION, I FOUND THAT THE OBJECT THAT I HAD RUN OVER (A RELATIVELY SMALL METAL OBJECT)HAD HIT THE EXPOSED BRAKE LINES WHERE THEY CONNECT TO A PROPORTIONING VALVE ASSEMBLY ABOUT HALF WAY BETWEEN THE LEFT FRONT AND LEFT REAR WHEELS. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A SMALL METAL AND RUBBER GARD TO PROTECT THE BRAKE LINES, THEY WERE INSUFFICIENT AND THE METAL OBJECT BENT THE GARD AND BROKE BOTH BRAKE LINES THAT CAME FROM THE MASTER BRAKE CYLINDER TO FEED THE REAR BRAKES. ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE HAS A DUAL MASTER CYLINDER, SINCE ONE CYLINDER FEEDS THE BACK RIGHT BRAKE AND THE OTHER FEEDS THE BACK LEFT BRAKE (WHILE ALSO FEEDING THE OPPOSITE FRONT BRAKE), THE FAILURE OF THE GARD TO PROTECT THE LINES RESULTED IN TOTAL BRAKE SYSTEM FAILURE. FORTUNATELY, I WAS NOT IN A CRITICAL STOPPING SITUATION, OR A SERIOUS ACCIDENT COULD HAVE OCCURRED. MY FEELING IS THAT THE PLACEMENT OF THESE EXPOSED BRAKE LINES DRIECTLY IN LINE BEHIND THE FRONT WHEEL WITH RELATIVELY LITTLE PROTECTION, RESULTING IN COMMON MODE FAILURE OF THE ENTIRE BRAKE SYSTEM IS AN UNSAFE SITUATION, AND BETTER PROTECTION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. WITH AS MANY OF THESE SINILAR VEHICLES ON THE ROAD, I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING HOW MANY SUCH INCIDENTS HAVE BEEN REPORTED.

THE DOOR WAS INDEED DIFFICULT TO CLOSE AND AS I MANAGED TO GET THE DOOR ALMOST CLOSED, IT FELL OFF OF THE TRACKING AND LANDED ON MY FEET.  MY FEET WERE HURT AS WELL AS BAD SCRAPING TO MY ARM AS I TRIED TO CATCH THE DOOR WHEN IT STARTED TO FALL.  I WAS IN TOTAL SHOCK AT HAVING A DOOR FALL OFF.  WE COULDN'T GET THE DOOR BACK ON AND HAD TO DRIVE WITH THE DOOR OFF.  I HAD TWO CHILDREN AND TWO ELDERLY PASSANGERS IN THE VAN BESIDES MYSELF AND MY FRIEND.  I HAD NO OTHER WAY OF GETTING THE VEHICLE HOME SO HAD TO DRIVE IT THIS WAY.  WHEN WE GOT HOME WE MANAGED TO GET THE DOOR BACK ONTO THE TRACK BUT COULD NOT OPEN THE DOOR AGAIN AS IT WAS INOPERABLE.  I CALLED CHRYSLER AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOT A RECALL ON THIS BUT THEY WOULD LOOK INTO HELPING ME GET THIS REPAIRED OUTSIDE OF THE WARRANTY AS THEY SAID THAT THEY DO THIS FROM TIME TO TIME.  WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR TO PAPA'S DODGE WHERE I BOUGHT THE VAN I WAS TOLD THAT THEY CALLED CHRYSLER CREDIT AND WERE TOLD THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE PART AND THE REPAIR AT THE COST OF AROUND 300.00.  A SERVICE TECHNICIAN TOLD MY FRIEND PRIVATELY THAT THEY HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS HAPPENING WITH THIS MODEL VAN.  I HAD BEEN TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT THIS PROBLEM HAD NEVER OCCURRED BEFORE.  THIS IS A SAFETY PROBLEM.  DOORS DON'T JUST FALL OFF OF CARS!  I WAS TOLD THAT THE ROLLERS HAD ERODED.  THIS SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER UNUSUAL WEAR.  ONE CAN'T TELL ME THAT EVERYBODY WHO OWNS A DODGE CARAVAN WILL HAVE THEIR DOOR FALL OFF AFTER 6 YEARS OF OWNERSHIP.  I DON'T AGREE THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS.  THIS IS NOT NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR, THIS IS ABNORMAL.  MY CHILDREN NOW HAVE TO CRAWL THROUGH THE FRONT OF THE CAR TO GET TO THEIR SEATS.  I AM ALSO IN FEAR OF THE DOOR FALLING OFF WHILE I AM DRIVING UNTIL I CAN GET THIS FIXED.  PLEASE HELP.  *AK",
