Down to 50mph, I hit the gas pedal, and then a loud BOOM happened and car shook. Smoke from the engine, and then all the dash lights came on. Lost all power. Looked under the engine and a piston had blown a hole through the bottom of it. Needs new engine now.  Mechanic inspected it and they documented with a picture.

FORTUNATELY THIS HAPPENED ON A CITY STREET AND NOT ON THE FREEWAY. POWER STEERING WAS OF COURSE LOST, SO THE MANEUVER WAS DIFFICULT.  AAA TOWED THE CAR TO OUR REPAIR SHOP, AND THEY REPORTED 24 ENGINE CODES WERE THROWN, AND RECOMMENDED A COMPLETE ENGINE TUNE-UP, INCLUDING REPLACEMENT OF THE SIX IGNITION COIL PACKS, SPARK PLUGS, AND INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKETS. MUCH OF THE $1,000 EXPENSE WAS 4.5 HOURS OF LABOR, TO REMOVE THE INTAKE MANIFOLD (NECESSARY TO REACH THE REAR BANK OF CYLINDERS 1,3,5). THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE IGNITION COILS HAVE FAILED ON THIS VEHICLE.  IN OCTOBER 2012 (AROUND 50K MILES) ENGINE CODE P0354 WAS THROWN, AND I REPLACED THE COIL ON CYLINDER 4. IN JANUARY 2014 (AROUND 58K MILES) CODE P0356 WAS THROWN, AND I REPLACED THE COIL ON CYLINDER 6.  SINCE THE DANGEROUS INCIDENT OF LOST POWER AND REPLACEMENT OF ALL SIX COILS ON 14 JUNE 2016 (AROUND 80K MILES) ONLY NINE MONTHS AND 7K MILES LATER, CODE P0351 (BAD COIL ON CYLINDER 1) WAS THROWN ON 24 MARCH 2017, AND NOW CODE P0355 (CYLINDER 5) WAS THROWN ON 28 MARCH 2017.  I HAVE ALREADY SPENT AROUND $1,200 TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM, AND THE CAR IS TODAY BACK IN THE REPAIR SHOP TO HAVE TWO REAR BANK COILS REPLACED, FOR $229. THERE IS CLEARLY SOMETHING WRONG WHEN THESE COILS ARE FAILING UNDER NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS, ESPECIALLY AFTER ONLY 7K MILES. THIS IS NOT JUST A PROBLEM FOR US.

IMPROPER ALIGNMENT WILL RESULT IN INCREASED TIRE WEAR AND DECREASED FUEL ECONOMY AND POSSIBLY DECREASED CONTRO WHILE DRIVING.

ON 10/16/14 I HAD (4) NEW SNOW TIRES INSTALLED AT SUMNER TIRE IN NEWPORT/DERBY, VT. I THOUGHT IT WOULD ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM BUT THE SWERVE/SWAY CONTINUED. ON 10/21/14 I HAD LOCAL MECHANIC PERFORM A FOUR WHEEL ALIGNMENT. THE MECHANIC COULD NOT MAKE THE ADJUST BUT CONFIRMED DRIVERS SIDE REAR WAS OUT OF ALIGNMENT. ON 1/16/15 I MADE AN APPOINTMENT AT HANDY TO RESOLVE THIS AND OTHER ISSUES. HANDY OFFERED FREE LABOR IF I PAID $309.43 FOR PARTS TO REPLACE THE FAILED RECALL. WITHIN A FEW DAYS I CONTACTED NATIONAL TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SPOKE TO [XXX]. REF #CAN'T BE ENTERED AS IT FLAGS AS A SS NUMBER. [XXX] CALLED BACK TO STATE THAT HANDY SHOULD BE CONTACTING ME BY END OF THE WEEK CONCERNING THIS ISSUE. RECEIVED A ON-LINE SURVEY ONLY IN WHICH I MADE CLEAR THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR A FAILED RECALL ITEM THAT WAS NOT FIXED PROPERLY. I CALLED NATIONAL C.S. AGAIN TWO WEEKS LATER TO REPORT THAT I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY CONTACT FROM HANDY. AFTER THAT CALL, STILL NO CONTACT WAS RECEIVED. I CALLED HANDY (3) TIMES ASKING TO SPEAK TO THE SERVICE MANAGER, [XXX] , WHO WAS ALWAYS BUSY. I FINALLY RECEIVED A CALL BACK FROM A SERVICE TECHNICIAN, [XXX], WITH A LOWER OFFER FOR THE COST OF THE PARTS TO FIX THE RECALL OF $226.03. I CALLED HANDY BACK STATING THAT I FELT THEIR OFFER WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND THAT I WOULD BE FILING A COMPLAINT WITH THE BBB FOR ASSISTANCE. MY POINT IN ALL OF THIS IS THAT TOYOTA ISSUED A RECALL FOR THIS PART AND THE RECALL FAILED AND SHOULD NOT BE REPAIRED AT THE CONSUMER'S COST. THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN OF MINE AS WELL AND LIMITS THE USE OF MY VEHICLE FOR LONG TRIPS.   *TR",

THE PROBLEM ISN'T GOING AWAY AND THE NOISE AND CLUNKY FEELING WHEN TURNING STEERING HAS BEEN  INCREASING. 3 MECHANICS FROM NON-TOYOTA DEALERSHIPS LOOKED AT MY CAR ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS AND DOCUMENTED THE NOISE AS A DEFECT IN THE CAR THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

HOWEVER, ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO, THEY CALLED ME AND TOLD ME THEY HAD SOME INFORMATION FOR ME.  I WAS TOLD THAT TO FIX THE PROBLEM I REALLY NEED A NEW ENGINE, AS THE OIL IS BEING USED INTERNALLY BY THE ENGINE DUE TO A PISTON ASSEMBLY DESIGN PROBLEM PER THE TSB. I ASKED IF TOYOTA WAS GOING TO FIX THE PROBLEM FOR ME AT IT'S COST, AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE IS NO RECALL BECAUSE IT IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE.

AFTER REFERRING TO THE MANUAL AND FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS YIELDED NO RESULT, I KEPT DRIVING AND WENT TO A TOYOTA DEALER THE NEXT DAY.  I WAS ADVISED THE TRANSMISSION IN MY CAR HAD FAILED AND I NEEDED A NEW ONE.  THE TRANSMISSION HAD BEEN FLUSHED ON 9/18/12 WITH 59,767 MILES ON MY CAR, THE DEALER MARKED THE TRANSMISSION FLUID \"GOOD\" ON 6/17/13 WITH 65,143 MILES AND  THERE WERE ONLY 66,319 WHEN THE TRANSMISSION FAILED IN AUGUST, 2013.  BEING STRANDED OUT OF TOWN FOR THREE DAYS ALLOWED ME TO FIND NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION FAILING IN RAV4'S WITH LOW MILEAGE.  THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING THAT A HUGE PROBLEM AND EXPENSE WAS ABOUT TO OCCUR  (WHICH IS STRANGE WHEN AN ALARM BLEATS, REQUESTING FASTENING OF THE SEATBELT, WHEN A GALLON OF MILK IS PUT ON THE PASSENGER SEAT.) AND THERE IS NOTHING IN THE MANUAL TO EVEN SUGGEST THE LIGHTS THAT LIT INDICATE A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM.  I HAVE FILED CASE #1310310749 WITH TOYOTA AND AWAIT THEIR FOLLOW UP ON PROMISES MADE.  I WILL HAPPILY PROVIDE COPIES OF ANY PAPERWORK, SHOULD IT BE REQUESTED. I WOULD ASK FOR THE TRANSMISSION FAILURES TO BE LOOKED INTO AS WELL AS THE TOTAL LACK OF CLARITY AND/OR DIRECTION IN THE MANUAL.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  *TR",

I WAS ABLE TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BUT THE CAR WAS DIFFICULT TO DRIVE. I CRANKED THE ENGINE ON AGAIN AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE FOR ANOTHER 100 YARDS. THE SAME WHINE NOISE FOLLOWED BY THE SAME LIGHTS AND ENGINE SHUT OFF. AFTERWARDS, THE ENGINE WOULD TURN ON AND IT IMMEDIATELY WOULD SHUT OFF; NOT A CHANCE TO ENGAGE TO DRIVE AND MOVE AN INCH.  I LOOKED AT THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND THERE WAS NOTHING UNUSUAL; THE OIL LEVEL WAS FINE (THE CAR HAS NEVER HAD A LEAK AND HAS BEEN PROPERLY MAINTAINED), NO FUNNY SMELLS, ETC.

I THOUGHT IT COULD BE THAT THE A/C COULD BE PART OF THE PROBLEM SINCE IT ADDS LOAD TO THE ENGINE SERPENTINE BELT; I TURNED OFF THE A/C BY DEPRESSING THE A/C BUTTON ON CAR'S DASH AND THE ENGINE STAYED ON.  I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR AND PICK UP MY SON THANKFULLY. I WAS READY TO SEND MY WIFE ON A CAB TO GET HIM.  MY QUESTIONS TO YOU GUYS ARE THE FOLLOWING:  WHY WOULD TOYOTA DESIGN THE ENGINE TO SHUT ITSELF OFF IN A SITUATION WHEN SOMETHING IN THE A/C FAILS? IF MY WIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE HIGHWAY WITH MY SON AND HAD THE ENGINE SHUT OFF, SHE WOULD HAVE COMPLETELY FREAKED OUT AND GOD FORBID IN AN ACCIDENT. ALL I CAN THINK OF IS THAT TOYOTA IMPLEMENTED A MECHANISM TO KILL THE ENGINE IF THE LOAD IN THE SERPENTINE BELT IS EXCESSIVE. YES, GOOD TO PREVENT ENGINE DAMAGE, BUT I VALUE MY FAMILY'S AND MY LIFE MORE. THE ENGINE SHOULD NOT SHUT OFF... THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE WARNING LIGHTS AND OTHER SAFETY MECHANISMS.  *TR",

WHICH MODELS ARE INVOLVED IN THE RECALL?   TOYOTA IS RECALLING 495,000 CERTAIN 2005 TO EARLY 2009 MODEL YEAR TOYOTA TACOMA VEHICLES SOLD IN THE U.S. NO OTHER VEHICLES ARE INVOLVED IN THIS RECALL.   2. WHAT IS THE CONDITION?  DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF THE STEERING WHEEL SPIRAL CABLE DESIGN AND CHARACTERISTICS UNIQUE TO THE TACOMA CHASSIS, FRICTION BETWEEN THE SPIRAL CABLE AND THE RETAINER IN THE STEERING WHEEL SPIRAL CABLE ASSEMBLY MAY OCCUR IN SOME VEHICLES. FRICTION OVER TIME MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE TO CERTAIN CIRCUITS THAT PROVIDE CONNECTIVITY TO THE DRIVER?S AIR BAG MODULE. IF CONNECTIVITY IS LOST, THE AIR BAG WARNING LAMP WILL REMAIN ILLUMINATED, AND THE DRIVER?S AIR BAG MAY BECOME DEACTIVATED, PREVENTING DEPLOYMENT IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH.  3. ARE THERE ANY WARNINGS THAT THIS CONDITION HAS OCCURRED?  YES. THE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT IS DESIGNED TO ILLUMINATE WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STARTED. IT GOES OFF AFTER ABOUT 6 SECONDS, INDICATING THE SYSTEM IS OPERATING AS DESIGNED. IF THE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT REMAINS ILLUMINATED AFTER THIS PERIOD, PLEASE CONTACT YOUR LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER FOR DIAGNOSIS AND APPROPRIATE REPAIR.  THIS EXACT CONDITION EXISTS IN MY 2006 RAV4, HOWEVER, I CANNOT AFFORD THE $583 REQUIRED FOR AN AUTHORIZED DEALER TO REPAIR IT.

THEY TOOK IT FOR A DRIVE AND CHECKED IT GOOD-SAID THAT 1ST GEAR WAS GOING, BUT IT WAS FINE TO DRIVE-COME BACK WHEN I COULDN'T STAND THE NOISE AND THEY'D PUT IN A NEW TRANS FOR $4,500. I WAS GOING OUT OF TOWN, THEY SAID OK, CAR WILL BE FINE. SINCE THE RUMBLE WAS SO LOUD, 3 DAYS LATER I GOT A SECOND OPINION AT A TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST'S SHOP RECOMMENDED TO ME BY SEVERAL FRIENDS. THEY PUT IT UP ON A RACK AND TESTED IT WITH A STETHOSCOPE TYPE DEVICE. THEY SAID THAT THE BEARING WAS VERY BAD AND THAT I SHOULD NOT TAKE THE CAR OUT OF TOWN OR DRIVE IT AS IT WAS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE AND COULD STOP AT ANY TIME. THEY REPLACED M,W/S, U240/24E 00-UP (CORK); FILTER; BUSHING, A40 SERIES PUMP; TC, RAV4, MED STALL, INK 14; CENTER GEAR BEARING, ETC.  WHEN THE TOYOTA TECHNICIAN CHECKED THE TRANS OIL, I REALIZED THAT IT WAS NOT \"A CLOSED SYSTEM\"! ALSO, THE OIL WAS BLACK AND I NOW KNOW THAT IT SHOULD BE RED. I THINK I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHANGING THE TRANS OIL ALL ALONG AND MY TRANSMISSION PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE FAILED. I THINK THEY SHOULD ORDER A RECALL ON ALL THESE TRANSMISSIONS - AND PAY FOR THE WORK THAT I HAD TO HAVE DONE BEFORE MY CAR FAILED ON A FREEWAY SOMEWHERE. A TRANSMISSION SHOULD LAST FOREVER, ESPECIALLY SINCE HALF OF THE MILES HAVE BEEN FREEWAY MILES AND I DRIVE MY CAR VERY GENTLY. I JUST PUT IN NEW BRAKE PADS FOR THE FIRST TIME RECENTLY AND THERE WAS STILL 20-30% LEFT ON THEM.  PREVIOUSLY I HAD TO PAY TOYOTA $400 TO REPAIR THE STEERING COLUMN-ANOTHER DEFECT THAT SHOULD BE A RECALL.  *TR",

THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD STILL COST THE SAME PRICE TO FIX AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS INSANE HOW TOYOTA KNEW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WITH SO MANY OTHERS AND REFUSE TO FIX IT. IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS A FAULTY PART ON ALL RAV4'S AROUND 2006-2007 (MAYBE MORE?). MOST COMPANIES WILL REALIZE THEY USED A FAULTY PART TO MAKE A PRODUCT AND REPLACE IT FREE OF CHARGE TO KEEP THE CUSTOMER HAPPY. THAT IS NOT THE CASE HERE. I CALLED TOYOTA'S NATIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE PHONE LINE AND SPOKE TO A NASTY PERSON WHO SPOKE VERY CONDESCENDINGLY TO ME.

I HAD TO CALL TOWING COMPANY TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE DEALER. THEY SAID THAT THE HOSE IS BROKEN, THE ONE THAT SUPPOSED TO BE UPGRADED LASTED ONLY 18,000 MILES.

WE LEFT THE DEALER WITH NOTHING, MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING THE CAR, HE PULLED TO THE PARKING LOT AND HEARD THIS BIG NOISE COMING FROM THE ENGINE. IT WAS 15 MINUTES AFTER WE LEFT THE DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT. MY HUSBAND CALLED THE RIGHT AWAY AND THEY SAID THAT THEY TESTED THIS CAR AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE BUT IF WE WANT WE CAN BRING THE CAR BACK. WE HAD TO CALL FOR TOWING COMPANY AGAIN. THE CAR CAME BACK TO THE SAME DEALER AND THEY ADMITTED THERE IS A NOISE BUT FOR THEM TO EVEN LOOK AT THE ENGINE THEY HAVE TO CHARGE US $1200. I HAVE ALREADY CALLED THE TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY SENDING ME BACK TO THE DEALER TO TALK TO THEIR CUSTOMER RELATION MANAGER. THE MANAGER SAID HE DID SOME INVESTIGATION AND MY PROBLEM WITH THE ENGINE IS NOT CONNECTED WITH THE REPAIR THEY DID. I TALK TO MANY DIFFERENT MECHANICS OUTSIDE OF TOYOTA AND THE SAID IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ENGINE TO JUST DIE. BESIDES EVERY MECHANIC SAYS THE HOSE SHOULD LAST MUCH LONGER THAN 18 MONTHS AND THEY BELIEVE THAT IT WAS NOT INSTALLED THE RIGHT WAY. TOYOTA MAIN OFFICE SAYS THE SUPPORT THE DEALER DECISION AND THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. THEY DON'T FEEL ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS SITUATION.

THE SERVICE MANAGER SCHEDULED A 2ND VISIT FOR MY VEHICLE ON JULY 7TH, IN ORDER FOR A SERVICE MECHANIC TO TEST DRIVE THE CAR. HE FIRST TOLD ME THAT THE UNIT WOULD NEED TO BE \"OPENED\" AND RE-PACKED WITH GREASE TO MAKE THE NOISE GO AWAY (WITHOUT BATTING AN EYE). ON THE SECOND SERVICE VISIT JULY 7TH, THE MECHANIC SAID THE UNIT WOULD REQUIRE A REBUILDING WITH AT LEAST $ 400.00 OF PARTS. THIS IS THE CASE AFTER I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN WITH 43K ORIGINAL MILES ON IT. AFTER I HAD A THIRD PARTY LOOK AT THE SAME ISSUE, THEY SAID THAT IT DID NOT PRESENT A DANGER, HOWEVER, NEW TIRES AND A FRONT END ALIGNMENT WERE SUGGESTED TO SEE WHETHER ANY IMPROVEMENT WOULD BE NOTICEABLE.. AFTERWARDS, I STARTED MY INVESTIGATION OF THIS MATTER, WHEREBY, I NOW KNOW THAT HUNDREDS OF CASES HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, AND, THE MANUFACTURER, TOYOTA, HAS \"PASSED THE BUCK\" ON THE BLAME AND REPAIR, CHARGING AS MUCH AS $ 1,200 FOR THE STEERING ON THE 2006 RAV 4 MODEL TO BE REPAIRED. SOUNDS LIKE A \"SCAM\" TO ME. JUST BECAUSE NO ONE HAS GOTTEN HURT YET, DOESN'T MEAN THERE ISN'T A PROBLEM HERE. CARS ARE CONTROLLED THROUGH THE ABILITY TO \"STEER\" THE VEHICLE. IN OCTOBER 1976, I SURVIVED AN ACCIDENT IN MY BRAND NEW FORD GRANADA, WHEN THE \"SUSPENSION ARM\" NUT WAS SHEERED OFF WHEN TAKING A CURVE ON A LOCAL ROAD WITH THE VEHICLE AT 20-25 MPH. THREE PEOPLE WALKED AWAY FROM AN ACCIDENT THAT TOOK OUT THE WHOLE FRONT BUMPER, BACK TO THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR. AS THE CAR WAS REPAIRED, FORD MOTOR CORP. GATHERED ALL OF THE ACCIDENT PHOTOS FROM THE BODY SHOP, PREVENTING DISCLOSURE OF A POTENTIAL PROBLEM (BACK BEFORE THE \"LEMON LAWS\" WERE PUT IN PLACE). DO NOT LET THIS PROBLEM SLIP AWAY.

I IMMEDIATELY CHECKED MY DASH AND NO LIGHTS WERE ON, PRESSURES OKAY.  THE NOISE STOPPED AND I KEPT DRIVING.  ABOUT TWELVE MILES FROM HOME THE NOISE STARTED AGAIN AND MY DAUGHTER NOTICED.  I LOOKED DOWN AND MY OIL PRESSURE LIGHT FLASHED ON AND RIGHT BACK OFF.  WE BARELY MADE IT TO OUR HOUSE.  WHEN I GOT OUT AND LOOKED UNDER THE CAR, OIL WAS EVERYWHERE.  IT HAD RAN ALL THE WAY TO THE BACK OF THE CAR.  WHEN I PULLED THE DIP STICK THERE WAS NO OIL ON THE STICK.  MY HUSBAND CHECKED IT TODAY AND FOUND A HOLE IN A RUBBER HOSE.  I WENT ON-LINE AND HAVE READ HUNDREDS OF SIMILAR STORIES.  SUPPOSEDLY, TOYOTA WAS TO SEND OUT A LETTER IN OCTOBER 2009 TO ALL 2006 RAV OWNERS.  WELL, I NEVER RECEIVED A LETTER AND I'VE BEEN THE ONE AND ONLY OWNER AT THE SAME ADDRESS.  SO, IT'S NOT LIKE I COULDN'T BE FOUND.  NOW MY HUSBAND IS TRYING TO FIND THE REPLACEMENT PART FOR THE VVTI- OIL HOSE, THAT IS NOW CALLED A 'PIPE'.  I WANT TO KNOW WHY THIS WASN'T CONSIDERED A RECALL ISSUE INSTEAD OF A LIMITED SERVICE CAMPAIGN?  THAT OIL HAD SPEWED ALL OVER AND UNDER THE HOT ENGINE ONTO THE MANIFOLD.  THERE WAS NOTHING KEEPING IT FROM CATCHING FIRE WHICH COULD HAVE TAKEN BOTH OUR LIVES.  IF I HAD RECEIVED THE LETTER (A YEAR AND A HALF AGO) THE HOSE COULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED.  NOW, I'M LOOKING AT REPAIR COSTS THAT COULD INCLUDE A NEW ENGINE.  AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH DAMAGE WAS DONE.  MY CAR IS PAID FOR AND I DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS TO BUY A NEW CAR OR HAVE THE ENGINE REPLACED.  I WANT TO KNOW WITH ALL OF THE OTHER TOYOTA ISSUES IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WHY THIS WASN'T ADDRESSED?

HOWEVER, I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND TOYOTA SHOULD BE COVERING THE REPAIRS.    I HAVE A 2006 RAV4 THAT ENCOUNTERED AN ISSUE FEB 2010.  I TOOK IT INTO A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND THE DIAGNOSIS WAS LEFT REAR SPEED SENSOR AND HARNESS.  SINCE THE ESTIMATE WAS A LITTLE OVER $1000.00, I WAS NOT ABLE TO AFFORD THE REPAIR.  WITHIN A FEW WEEKS AFTER I PICKED UP THE CAR, THE ABS, TRAC AND VSC LIGHTS WENT OFF AND STAYED OFF UNTIL DEC 2010.  WHEN THE LIGHTS CAME BACK ON, I STARTED TO RESEARCH THE ISSUE AND CAME UP WITH A \"TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (TSB)\" EXPLAINING EXACTLY THE SYMPTOM I AM EXPERIENCING.  THE TSB STATES THAT SOME 2006 MODEL YEAR RAV4 VEHICLES MAY EXHIBIT AN ABS M.I.L. \"ON\"............  THE TSB GOES ON STATING THE REAR WHEEL SENSOR HAVE BEEN MODIFIED TO CORRECT THIS CONDITION.  MY VIN NUMBER ACCORDING TO THIS TSB SHOWS THAT MY RAV4 IS ONE OF THOSE VEHICLES THAT FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY OF A POSSIBLE FAILURE.     THE WARRANTY INFORMATION STATED THE REPAIR IS COVERED UNDER THE TOYOTA COMPREHENSIVE WARRANTY OF 3 YEARS OR 36,000 MILES.  THE WARRANTY APPLICATION DOES ALSO STATE THE REPAIR IS LIMITED TO CORRECTION BASED UPON A CUSTOMER'S SPECIFIC COMPLAINT.    I DROVE TO A DEALER IN MY AREA AND EXPLAINED THE ISSUE AND SHOWED THEM THE TSB.  I ALSO CALLED YOUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE CENTER.  UNFORTUNATELY, I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY COOPERATION CONCERNING MY ISSUE.      MY RAV4 IS 4 YEARS OLD AND HAD AROUND 48,000 MILES (THE FIRST TIME THIS ISSUE OCCURRED) - JUST OUT OF THE \"COMPREHENSIVE WARRANTY\".  I PURCHASED A TOYOTA FOR ITS RELIABILITY AND SAFETY.  NOW, BOTH OF THOSE REASONS ARE HINDERED BECAUSE OF AN ISSUE TOYOTA KNEW ABOUT IN 2006 THAT UNFORTUNATELY OCCURRED ON MY VEHICLE JUST OUT OF THE WARRANTY.     I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO SOMEONE THAT CAN MAKE A REASONABLE AND CONSCIOUS DECISION CONCERNING MY COMPLAINT.  *TR",

I TOOK MY RAV INTO THE DEALERSHIP AT 1PM ON THE 20TH AND AT 5 PM THEY LET ME KNOW THEY WOULD NEED TO KEEP MY RAV OVERNIGHT BECAUSE THEY WERE UNABLE TO FIND THE PROBLEM. THE NEXT DAY THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND INTERMEDIATE SHAFT INTERNAL FAILURE.  I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE PURCHASED THE EXTENDED WARRANTY HOWEVER THESE 2 DAYS OF FAULTY PRODUCT COST ME $262.52 WHEN I HAD ONLY A$50.00 DEDUCTIBLE. I WAS TOLD I WOULD SPLIT THE COST OF THE RENTAL CAR AS THE COVERAGE ONLY COVERED A RENTAL IF THE REPAIR TOOK OVER 6 HOURS. IT TOOK OVER 6 HOURS TO EVEN FIND THE PROBLEM EVEN WITH THE SMART TEAM.

THE DEALER ARGUED THAT I HAVE TO BE AN AGGRESSIVE DRIVER THAT WHY I WORE THE BRAKES SO FAST AND THAT IT IS NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY. THIS PROBLEM WAS REPEATED TWICE AFTER THAT.  THIS MEANS THAT IN LESS THAN 4 YEARS. I CHANGED THE FRONT BRAKE PADS TWICE AND THE REAR BRAKE PADS ONCE. I FOUND THIS EXTREMELY UNUSUAL.  SO FAR I HAVE SPENT ALMOST $1000 TO REPEATEDLY CHANGE BRAKE PADS AND ROTORS.  RECENTLY I BELIEVE I FOUND THE PROBLEM. WHEN I PRESS THE GAS PEDAL THE CAR SPEEDS VERY EASILY AND VERY FAST. HOWEVER, WHEN I RELEASE MY FOOT OFF THE GAS PEDAL THE CAR DOES NOT SLOW DOWN SPONTANEOUSLY. THE GAS PEDAL TAKES AN UNUSUALLY LONG TIME TO GO TO THE IDLE POSITION. HENCE, I HAVE TO USE THE BRAKES MUCH MORE FREQUENTLY  WHICH WEARS THEM OUT VERY FAST. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND FIXED. I AM GOING TO THE DEALER TOMORROW. *TR",

I SPENT MOST OF THE DAY DRIVING HOME TO GET A SPARE KEY AND BACK AGAIN TO THE CAR'S LOCATION. AT THAT TIME, TOYOTA CUSTOMER RELATIONS RESPONDED WITH THE SAME ARROGANCE THE COMPANY HAS DEMONSTRATED REGARDING THE ACCELERATION ISSUE. THEY TOLD ME \"THAT'S HOW THE LOCKS ARE DESIGNED\" (EVEN THOUGH NO ONE COULD EXPLAIN THE BENEFIT) AND THEY TOLD ME THE LOCKS WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY LOCK IF THE KEY IS IN THE IGNITION. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE SINCE PETS AND SMALL CHILDREN CAN BE INADVERTENTLY LOCKED INSIDE OF A SUFFOCATING HOT VEHICLE. THIS WOULD RESULT IN PROPERTY DAMAGE IF THE OWNER HAS TO BREAK A WINDOW. FORTUNATELY, IN THIS INSTANCE, I WAS ABLE TO LOCATE A SPARE KEY BEFORE MY DOG DIED.  IF I WERE A MANUFACTURER, I WOULD WANT TO KNOW ABOUT ANY DESIGN FLAW TO BE ABLE TO FIX IT. TOYOTA, HOWEVER, RESPONDED IN AN OVERCONFIDENT WAY, ACCEPTING NO RESPONSIBILITY.  EVENTS LEADING UP TO MOST RECENT INCIDENT: A FRIEND AND I DROVE TO A DUMP LESS THAN A MILE FROM MY HOME. WE GOT OUT OF THE VEHICLE, OPENED THE BACK DOOR AND BEGAN TO UNLOAD THE TRASH. MY SMALL DOG WAS IN THE FRONT SEAT, AND THE KEY WAS IN THE IGNITION. WHEN FINISHED UNLOADING, I SHUT THE BACK DOOR AND WENT TO OPEN THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR. IT WAS LOCKED. MY FRIEND ATTEMPTED TO OPEN THE PASSENGER SIDE DOOR AND IT WAS LOCKED.

AFTER GETTING THROUGH THE INITIAL SHOCK I PUT THE TRANSMISSION IN NEUTRAL, THE ENGINE REVVED UP TO THE RED LINE AND I TURNED THE IGNITION SWITCH OFF. AFTER WAITING FOR A MINUTE I RESTARTED THE CAR IN PARK AND THE ENGINE IDLED NORMALLY.    I TOOK THE CAR TO THE TOYOTA DEALER FOR THE SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE AND AFTER INSPECTING IT HE TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR.    AFTER THE RECALL OF THE TOYOTA RAV 4'S I CALLED THE TOYOTA DEALER I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM AND TALKED TO HIS SERVICE MANAGER. HE TOLD ME THAT THE 2006 RAV 4'S HAVE NOT BEEN RECALLED AS THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT GAS PEDAL AND WERE MADE IN JAPAN. HE COULD NOT EXPLAIN THE CAUSE OF THE ACCELERATION.    THE CAR HAS NOT DONE THAT SINCE, HOWEVER I AM NOT DRIVING THE CAR ANYMORE. MY DAUGHTER IS AND THIS CONCERNS ME GREATLY.    NO FIXES OR REPAIRS  HAVE BEEN DONE ON THE CAR BY THE TOYOTA DEALER. *TR",

OCCASIONALLY, THIS HAS HAPPENED AGAIN IN THE ENSUING 3 YEARS. UNTIL THIS UNINTENDED ACCELERATION PROBLEM CAME TO LIGHT IN 2010, I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST \"OPERATOR ERROR.\" NOW, I AM BEGINNING TO THINK THERE IS SOME DEFECT - MAYBE IT'S HARDWARE LINKAGES, BUT I SUSPECT THERE IS A SOFTWARE PROBLEM IN THE ELECTRONIC COMPUTER OF THE CAR. I ALSO HAD THE STEERING MID-SHAFT PROBLEM AFTER WARRANTY AND SCREAMED UNTIL THEY FIXED IT UNDER WARRANTY FOR $50. THERE WAS ALSO A \"RUNAWAY\" FUEL PUMP SERVICE BULLETIN I MADE THEM COVER AS WELL. I HAVE WORKED WITH TOYOTA QUALITY ENGINEERS SINCE THE 1980S AND AM DISGUSTED BY THEIR RESPONSES REPORTED IN THIS ODI SITE. TOYOTA'S CLAIM TO FAME WAS THERE QUALITY AND CUSTOMER FOCUS. LOOKS LIKE THE CURRENT GENERATION OF TOYOTA PEOPLE HAVE LOST THIS, AND THAT POINTS DIRECTLY TO TOP MANAGEMENT THERE. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME.

IN NOVEMBER 2007 (MILEAGE: 11,989), I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER DUE TO THE SAME NOISE. I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG. IN DECEMBER 2007 I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AGAIN (MILEAGE: 12,717) WITH STILL THE SAME PROBLEM AND NOISE. DEALER PERSONNEL DETERMINED A DAMAGED STEERING SHAFT ASSEMBLY WHICH WAS ORDERED (PART # 45260-42090) AND INSTALLED FOR THE SECOND TIME. ON OCTOBER 13, 2008, (MILEAGE: 21,152) THE CAR WAS AGAIN MAKING THE SAME NOISE AND TAKEN TO THE DEALER, WHERE THE STEERING SHAFT WAS AGAIN REPLACED.  I WAS TOLD THAT A DIFFERENT PART HAD TO BE REPLACED (PART # 45221-42070). ON JULY 2, 2009, THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER FOR MAINTENANCE.  I AGAIN REPORTED THE SAME NOISE COMING FROM THE STEERING WHEEL.  THE TECHNICIAN DROVE THE VEHICLE AND SAID EVERYTHING WAS FINE. ON NOVEMBER 6, 2009, I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A DIFFERENT AUTO SHOP.  THE MECHANIC DISASSEMBLED THE STEERING WHEEL AND IDENTIFIED THE NOISE.  HE PERSONALLY TOOK THE CAR TO A DIFFERENT TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND SPOKE TO A TECHNICIAN.  AT THAT DEALERSHIP, HE WAS TOLD THAT THE NOISE IS A 'NORMAL CONDITION' AND THAT TOYOTA PERSONNEL ARE AWARE OF THE NOISE BUT THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OR HOW TO FIX IT.  ALSO, HE WAS TOLD OTHER TOYOTA VEHICLES HAVE A SIMILAR PROBLEM. WE ARE NOW IN FEBRUARY 2010.

I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM A MEETING ABOUT 15 MILES AWAY VIA INTERSTATE. WHEN I STARTED MY CAR LEAVING THE MEETING, MY OIL PRESSURE LIGHT BLINKED ON THEN WENT OFF. ALTHOUGH IT WAS UNUSUAL, I DID NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT THINKING I WOULD CHECK MY OIL WHEN I GOT HOME. MIDWAY HOME, I BEGAN TO HEAR SOME STRANGE NOISES COMING FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. SINCE IT WAS FAIRLY HOT, I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE THE FAN AND SHUT DOWN THE AC AND TURNED OFF THE RADIO TO LISTEN. THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO MAKE STRANGE NOISES. AFTER STOPPING AT THE END OF THE EXIT RAMP NEAR HOME I ACCELERATED ONTO THE SIDE STREET AND THE NOISE BECAME VERY LOUD. I DROVE SLOWLY THE LAST 1/2 MILE HOME. WHEN I GOT HOME, I OPENED THE HOOD AND FOUND OIL ALL OVER THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. THERE WAS NO OIL READING ON THE DIPSTICK. NOTE THAT THE OIL PRESSURE LIGHT NEVER CAME ON. I ADDED THE ONLY QUART OF OIL THAT I HAD AT HOME AND DROVE SLOWLY TO MY MECHANIC ABOUT A MILE AWAY. WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THE CAR THE NEXT MORNING, THEY SAID THERE WAS LITTLE OR NO OIL IN THE ENGINE. A RUBBER HOSE THAT RAN FROM THE VALVE COVER TO THE OIL PUMP RESERVOIR HAD SPLIT AND PUMPED OUT ALL THE OIL. THEY SAID THAT ALTHOUGH THE HOSE HAD SOME METAL SHIELDING, THE HEAT HAD DETERIORATED THE RUBBER CAUSING THE SPLIT. THEY WERE ABLE TO REPLACE THE PART AND CLEAN MY ENGINE COMPARTMENT FOR $600. I JUST DROVE IT ABOUT 300 MILES TODAY AND AFTER A FEW MILES OF DRIVING, THE ENGINE RETURNED TO ITS NORMAL SOUND SO I AM HOPING THAT THERE WAS NO LONG TERM DAMAGE.    MY CONCERN IS THAT I HAD JUST RETURNED FROM A 2000 MILE TRIP TO CANADA AND IF THAT HAD HAPPENED DURING AN EXTENDED ROAD TRIP, MY ENGINE WOULD BE TOAST. MY MECHANIC SAID THAT HE WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS ISSUE EVEN THOUGH HE HAS THE SAME ENGINE IN HIS 2008 TOYOTA.

I AM ASKING FOR A FULL INVESTIGATION WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL LEAD TO A RECALL OF THE 2006 RAV4'S AND ANY OTHER YEAR THIS AFFECTS. MEGAN, THE ASSISTANT SERVICE MANAGER AT LITHIA TOYOTA CONFIRMED WITH MY INSURANCE ADJUSTER, JOSE LARA (GEICO 707-688-3318) THE COST IS COVERED UNDER THE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY....WHAT ABOUT THE COST OF MY LIFE, AND THE LIVES OF THE OTHER MOTORIST SURROUNDING ME???

IN AUGUST 2007 (VEHICLE MILEAGE: 9,540), I HAD TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO THE CAR DEALER BECAUSE OF A STRANGE NOISE COMING FROM THE STEERING SHAFT ASSEMBLY WHICH HAD TO BE ORDERED (PART # 45260-42090) AND INSTALLED.  IN NOVEMBER 2007 (VEHICLE MILEAGE: 11,989), I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER DUE TO THE SAME NOISE.  I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG. IN DECEMBER 2007 I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER ONCE AGAIN (VEHICLE MILEAGE: 12,717) WITH STILL THE SAME PROBLEM AND NOISE.  DEALER PERSONNEL DETERMINED A DAMAGED STEERING SHAFT ASSEMBLY WHICH WAS ORDERED (PART # 45260-42090) AND INSTALLED FOR THE SECOND TIME.  WE ARE NOW IN SEPTEMBER 2008 AND MY RAV 4 (VEHICLE MILEAGE: 20,855) IS BECOMING NOISY AGAIN WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  I HAVE NO QUESTION IN MY MIND TAT THE STEERING SHAFT ASSEMBLY WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED FOR A THIRD TIME.  I HAVE NEVER BEEN INFORMED BY TOYOTA THAT RAV 4 VEHICLES HAVE BEEN RECALLED BUT HAVE READ ONLINE THAT OTHER MODELS SUCH AS THE PRIUS HAVE BEEN RECALLED WITH THIS PROBLEM. *TR",

OUT OF TOWN THIS PAST SATURDAY EVENING, I WAS LOADING THE BACK OF MY VEHICLE AND SET MY KEYS DOWN INSIDE.

TO MY SURPRISE, I WAS TOLD THAT LOCKOUTS ARE NOT A COVERED SERVICE. I TOOK MY VEHICLE IN FOR SERVICE AUGUST 7TH. AT FIRST, THE SERVICE ADVISOR AGREED THAT THE LOCKS SHOULD NOT BE WORKING THE WAY THEY ARE AND SAID THAT HE WOULD GET THE PROBLEM FIXED. AFTER WAITING TWO HOURS, HE SAID THAT THE LOCKS ARE WORKING CORRECTLY, AND THE WAY THEY WERE DESIGNED TO WORK. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I WAS LOCKED OUT, I WAS CLOSE TO HAVING PUT A TWO YEAR OLD IN THE VEHICLE WITH THE TEMPERATURE NEAR 100 DEGREES. THE ONLY TIME I WANT THE LOCKS TO LOCK AUTOMATICALLY IS AFTER I'VE STARTED THE VEHICLE AND AM DRIVING. THIS IS NOT A SAFETY FEATURE INCLUDED WITH THE RAV 4.  I WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THE DEALER RESPONSE, AND I WOULD LIKE THIS PROBLEM RESOLVED. IF THE LOCKS TRULY ARE DESIGNED TO LOCK AUTOMATICALLY WITHIN 30 SECONDS TO ONE MINUTE, WHETHER A DOOR IS OPEN OR NOT, I WOULD LIKE TOYOTA TO PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION OF THE BENEFIT OF THIS DESIGN.

AROUND 12,500 MILES, I NOTICED A STRANGE GRINDING NOISE COMING FROM THE STEERING WHEN MAKING A HARD RIGHT OR LEFT TURN (TURNING INTO A PARKING PLACE OR MY DRIVEWAY).  I TALKED WITH THE TOYOTA DEALER AND THE FIRST ATTEMPT WAS TO HEAVILY LUBRICATE THE STEERING AS I WAS TOLD EVERYTHING WAS DRY.  THE CAR HAD BEEN SERVICED FOR AN OIL AND LUBE EVERY 4,000 MILES.  THIS DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE.  I WAS TOLD THAT I NEEDED A NEW RACK AND PINION STEERING UNIT.  THE DEALER FORGOT TO ORDER THE PART.  AFTER A WEEK AND A HALF, I CALLED TO FIND OUT THAT THE PART WAS ON BACK ORDER AS THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE'S STEERING.

THE NEW RACK AND PINION UNIT AND GEARS WERE INSTALLED YESTERDAY.  ADDITIONALLY, A RECOMMENDED WHEEL ALIGNMENT WAS DONE, AND IT FEELS AS IF THE FRONT BRAKES WERE ADJUSTED.  THE VEHICLE FEELS GOOD, BUT THE CRUNCHING NOISE IS STILL THERE.    DOES TOYOTA HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING ON THESE VEHICLES?  IF SO, I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED.

I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE TRANSMISSION IS VERY SLUGGISH TO RESPOND TO BRAKING, SUCH THAT THE ENGINE SOMETIMES CONTINUES TO REV FORWARD FOR A SECOND OR TWO EVEN AFTER THE BRAKE PEDAL IS DEPRESSED.  THIS LEADS TO EXCESSIVE BRAKING DISTANCES.  I BELIEVE THIS PROBLEM IS THE CAUSE OF AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT THAT WE SUFFERED ON 8/5/06.  IN DENSE HIGHWAY TRAFFIC, I WAS ABOUT 20 FEET BEHIND AN OLDER TOYOTA PATHFINDER AND HAD JUST ACCELERATED FROM ABOUT 15 MPH TO ABOUT 25 MPH, AS THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE VEHICLES WAS GROWING.  THEN THE PATHFINDER IN FRONT OF ME SUDDENLY SLAMMED ON HIS/HER BRAKES BECAUSE ANOTHER VEHICLE SWERVED DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF IT.  I SLAMMED ON MY BRAKES TOO, BUT THE RAV4 DID NOT IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO SLOW.  INSTEAD, I COULD FEEL THE ENGINE STILL PUSHING THE CAR FORWARD.  THE RAV4 FINALLY DID BEGIN TO SLOW DOWN RIGHT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THE PATHFINDER CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP.  AS A RESULT, WE HIT THE NOW-STATIONARY PATHFINDER IN FRONT OF US AT A SPEED OF ABOUT 5 MPH.  FORTUNATELY, NO ONE WAS HURT, BUT THE FRONT END OF THE RAV4 WAS MASHED IN.  I HAVE DRIVEN DOZENS OF DIFFERENT VEHICLES OVER NEARLY 20 YEARS OF DRIVING EXPERIENCE, AND I THINK EVERY OTHER ONE WOULD HAVE COME TO A COMPLETE STOP WELL BEFORE THE POINT OF IMPACT (AS DID THE PATHFINDER IN FRONT OF ME, DESPITE A VEHICLE CUTTING DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF IT).  THIS LEADS ME TO SUSPECT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE RAV4 TRANSMISSION.  THE TRANSMISSION SHOULD IMMEDIATELY DISENGAGE FROM DRIVE WHENEVER THE BRAKE IS DEPRESSED, BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A DANGEROUS TIME LAG.  WHEN I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP AND EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED, THEY ROAD-TESTED AND EXAMINED THE VEHICLE AND SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG.  THEY CLAIMED WHAT I EXPERIENCED WAS THE VEHICLE DOWN-SHIFTING, WHICH RESULTS IN HIGHER RPMS BUT LESS FORWARD MOTION.  I DON'T BUY IT.

AFTER THE DELAY, FORWARD SPEED IS DELIVERED SUDDENLY, CAUSING THE CAR TO LURCH FORWARD AND THE ENGINE TO RACE. THE FORWARD SPEED LAGS CONTINUOUSLY UP HILLS, DEPENDING ON THE GRADE. UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, EVERYDAY DRIVING IS HAZARDOUS AND I HAVE HAD MANY CLOSE CALLS.   THE TOYOTA DEALER DISMISSED OUR INITIAL COMPLAINTS, STATING THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS 'NORMAL', AND WE PUT UP WITH THIS FOR TOO LONG BEFORE INSISTING THE VEHICLE BE CHECKED OUT. THE DEALER SAID NO ERROR CODES WERE GENERATED AND NO TSB'S HAD BEEN ISSUED AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM IN ORDER TO FIX IT, AS THOUGH WE'RE THE ONLY PEOPLE WITH THIS COMPLAINT.

MOST OF GLASS REMAINED LOOSELY INTACT BUT WAS ALL SHATTERED WITH A MEDIUM SIZE HOLE IN THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE REAR WINDOW, WITH SMALL FRAGMENTS FOUND OUTSIDE OF WINDOW. SMALL PIECES OF GLASS CONTINUED TO FALL OUT. THE CAR HAD BEEN SITTING COLD (NOT RUNNING) SINCE THE EVENING PRIOR (6:30PM) AND WAS IN PARTLY SHADED AREA. BOTH REAR DRIVER/ PASSENGER SIDE WINDOWS LOWERED ABOUT 2 INCHES TO CIRCULATE AIR. NOTHING WAS IN CAR TO CONTRIBUTE TO INTERNAL PRESSURE AND NOTHING HIT THE CAR AS I WAS WITNESS TO THIS EVENT AS IT OCCURRED. DRIVEWAY IS ON A HILL; CAR FACED FORWARD AND ANGLED DOWN THE HILL TOWARD GARAGE (CAR REAR END HIGHEST). LARGE GLASS PIECES FOUND MOSTLY OUTSIDE OF CAR JUST BELOW WINDOW WITH SOME LARGER PIECES LAYING ON OUTSIDE OF REAR DOOR WITH SMALLER FRAGMENTS ON THE GROUND BELOW. SMALL GLASS FRAGMENTS FOUND INSIDE CAR BELOW WINDOW. PICTURES TAKEN.  TOYOTA CONTACTED AND QUESTIONED AS TO NEXT STEP. TOYOTA REPRESENTATIVE OFFERED NOTHING AS THIS WAS HOLIDAY WEEKEND AND NOTHING WAS AVAILABLE,ACCORDING TO TOYOTA.  AUTO GLASS REPAIR COMPANIES CALLED AND NO ONE AVAILABLE DUE TO HOLIDAY.  INSURANCE COMPANY CALLED, GIVEN SAME STORY AGAIN!  TOYOTA CALLED AGAIN.  CAN'T LEAVE CAR SIT WITH BROKEN REAR WINDOW AND WE EXPECT RAIN. ASKED ABOUT KNOCKING REST OF GLASS OUT AS THE GLASS NEEDED TO BE CLEANED UP AND OPENING NEEDED TO BE SECURED.  I EXPLAINED I COULDN'T DRIVE THE CAR, IT WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE & TOWING WAS NOT AN OPTION AS NEAREST TOYOTA DEALER DIDN'T HAVE TOWING CAPACITY...AND CLOSED IN AN HOUR. KNOCKED REST OF GLASS OUT AND TAPED UP REAR WINDOW OPENING.  DROVE TO DEALER MON MORNING TO LEAVE RAV FOR REPAIR AND SECURED RENTAL CAR. TOLD MY CAR WOULD NOT BE LOOKED AT UNTIL WED. THUR MY CAR LOOKED AT AND NEW WINDOW ORDERED AND HOPED TO BE HERE IN A WEEK OR SO. BROKEN GLASS DISPOSED OF.  *NM",

ALSO THERE'S AN ONGOING (MONTH OR SO) DRONING NOISE.  I TOOK CAR TO TOYOTA DEALER 6/15/06. SERVICE WRITER AND 2 TECHS HEARD DRONING NOISE WHILE I WAS THERE. WITH THE CAR.  I ASKED TO BRING THE CAR IN THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY AS I WORK DURING THE WEEK, BUT THEY SAID SATURDAYS NOT GOOD SO I MADE APPOINTMENT FOR 6/26/06.  THEY TOLD ME IT WASN'T DANGEROUS TO DRIVE THE CAR.  I TOOK  CAR IN 6/26/06 & RODE WITH  MASTER TECH WHO WAS ABLE TO HEAR THE DRONING NOISE.  HE DROVE CAR, ALSO SAT IN PARKING LOT WITH ENGINE RUNNING AND SHIFTED INTO PARK AND INTO REVERSE ETC. WITH HIS FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND NOISE CHANGED IN INTENSITY IN  DIFFERENT GEARS. HE TOOK CAR BACK TO SERVICE CENTER AND CHECKED IT OUT. THE SERVICE WRITER SAID THE TECH NOT ABLE TO PINPOINT PROBLEM, BUT TECH WOULD CALL TOYOTA ENGINEERING THE NEXT MORNING BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO TRY A FIX WHEN HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.  THEY GAVE ME MY CAR BACK, SAID THEY'D CALL ME AFTER TALKING TO TOYOTA ENGINEERING.  THEY CALLED ME 6/27/06, SAID MASTER TECH HAD TALKED TO TOYOTA ENGINEERING AND THEY'VE HAD OTHER COMPLAINTS RE SAME DRONING NOISE, ARE WORKING TO FIND CAUSE SO THEY CAN CREATE A TSB AND EITHER REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE NOISE.  SERVICE WRITER TOLD ME T THERE IS NO TIMELINE FOR A FIX AND TO JUST \"SIT TIGHT\" AND WAIT UNTIL THEY CALL. THEY AGREE THE NOISE SHOULD NOT BE THERE. I'M WORRIED THAT ONGOING NOISE INDICATES THAT SOME PART IS OVERWORKING AND MAY WEAR OUT AND SINCE THE NOISE CHANGES IN INTENSITY SOMETIMES DEPENDING WHAT GEAR THE CAR IS IN I WORRY THAT IT IS THE TRANSMISSION AND THAT A FAILURE MAY RESULT.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN TELL ME THE VEHICLE IS SAFE TO DRIVE WHEN THEY CLAIM THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.  IT IS VERY UNSETTLING TO HAVE TO JUST WAIT FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG FOR THEM TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  *NM",
