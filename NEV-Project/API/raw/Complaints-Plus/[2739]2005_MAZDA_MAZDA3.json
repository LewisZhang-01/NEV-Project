Striking the right side of the center console will generally result in functionality being restored. Sometimes, simply turning the lights off and then on again results in the failure as well. My assumption, based on online forums where others have had the same issues, is that the Passenger Junction Box (PJB) is faulty. Striking the center console send vibrations to the PJB, resulting in it (usually) to start working again.  While I do not regularly drive the vehicle at night, my concern is that without working tail lights, I could be involved in an accident OR be ticketed for my lights not working. Others online have had the same issues, and I believe it may be an issue in multiple vehicle models and model years.",
