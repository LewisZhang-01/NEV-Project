THE CURRENT RECALL INVOLVES THE 'CLOCK SPRING' WHICH HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED IN VW MODELS INCLUDING: 2010-14 CC; 2010-13 EOS; 2011-2014 GOLF; 2011-14 GTI; 2012-14 JETTA SPORTWAGEN; 2011-14 JETTA SEDAN; 2010 PASSAT AND PASSAT WAGON; 2012-14 PASSAT SEDAN, AND 2011-14 TIGUAN.    THERE IS NO RECALL FOR THE 2014 VW BEETLE, THE ONLY MODEL NOT INCLUDED IN THE VW MODELS RECALL.    MY 2014 BETTLE TURBO EXPERIENCE FAILURE OF THE CLOCK SPRING AROUND 80,000 MILES.  THERE WAS NO LIGHT ON THE DASH INDICATING A FAILURE OF THE AIR BAG, HORN, OR CRUISE CONTROL.  AN ATTEMPT TO USE THE CRUISE CONTROL AND THE HORN WERE BOTH FOUND INOPERATIVE CAUSED IMMEDIATE CONCERN.  A CHECK OF THE FUSES INDICATED AN ACCESSORY (12V ACCESSORY CHARGING/CIGARETTE LIGHTER) NEEDED REPLACED.  THE REPLACED FUSE DID NOT REMEDY THE OTHER SAFETY ISSUES.      THE VEHICLE WAS INSPECTED BY A VW DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND FOUND TO HAVE A DEFECTIVE CLOCK SPRING AND ADVISED THAT REPLACEMENT FOR THE PART WOULD BE $450+.  DUE TO THE AGE/MILEAGE THE PART WAS NOT COVERED BY THE WARRANTY.  I WAS ADVISED THAT THERE WERE NO RECALLS ON THIS ITEM.    MY CONCERN IS THAT THE DRIVER-SIDE AIR BAG IS INOPERATIVE AND CONSTITUTES A NHTSA SAFETY RECALL.

THE SECOND TIME I WAS STRANDED WAS AT THE COLUMBIA MALL.  THE SAME THING HAPPENED AND AFTER ABOUT 20 MINUTES, IT STARTED.  THE THIRD TIME WAS AT MY SCHOOL.  IT WAS WEEK BEFORE LAST, ONE OF THE HOTTEST DAYS OF THE SUMMER.  I HAD AN APPOINTMENT AFTER SCHOOL   AND  SO I GOT OUT A FEW MINUTES EARLY.  I GOT INTO A 120 DEGREE CAR AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED.  THE WINDOWS WOULD NOT ROLL DOWN AND SHUTTING THE DOOR, BUCKLING UP, AND PRESSING THE BRAKE, THE KEY WOULD NOT  TURN IN THE IGNITION.  I WAS SWEATING THROUGH ALL MY CLOTHES AND FEELING PANICKED.
