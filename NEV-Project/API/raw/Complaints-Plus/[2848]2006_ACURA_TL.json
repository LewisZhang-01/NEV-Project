AFTER INVESTIGATING, THIS CRACK CANNOT BE REPAIRED, AND TOTAL DASH REPLACEMENT IS THE ONLY SAFE ALTERNATIVE. MY ACURA HAS ONLY ONE OWNER, PARKED UNDER CARPORT, KEPT IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, 91,000 MILES, WITH ALL DEALERSHIP MAINTENANCE RECORDS FOR THE PAST 12.5 YEARS. I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING FURTHER THAN A REPLACEMENT DASHBOARD TO BE INSTALLED BY MANUFACTURER AT THIS TIME DUE TO MY EXTREME CONCERN FOR MY PASSENGERS' SAFETY. AIRBAGS ARE VERY DANGEROUS AND CAN CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY SO NO NEED TO HAVE AN EXPOSED AIRBAG SAFETY ISSUE UNATTENDED. I WOULD LIKE RESOLUTION ASAP FROM MANUFACTURER. THANK YOU.",

WELL IN LESS THAN A MONTH IT WAS GONE FROM FRONT OF THE DASH (NEAR THE WINDSHIELD) TO THE BACK. NOW THE DASH LOOKS LIKE 2 SEPARATE PIECES. THE CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. IF YOU PRY UP A LITTLE THE DASH WHERE IT IS CRACKED YOU CAN SEE WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE AIRBAG. I FEAR THIS MAY CAUSE A FAILED OR IMPROPER DEPLOYMENT I THE EVENT IF A ACCIDENT. IF YOU SEARCH ONLINE FOR 2006 ACURA TL DASHBOARD CRACK. YOU WILL COME ACROSS HUNDREDS OF PICTURES AND COMPLAINTS WHERE THE CRACK HAS ALWAYS FORMED AROUND THE PASSENGER AIRBAG. I FEEL THIS WOULD CAUSE THAT PIECE TO FLY AT THE PASSENGER IN THE EVENT OF AN AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT. IF YOU CALL ACURA THEY DENY AN ISSUE OR DEFECT AND SOMETIMES EVEN SAY ITS WEATHER RELATED.

I ATTRIBUTED THIS SOFTNESS TO THE NEW CAR'S GREATER WEIGHT -- THE BRAKES DID AFTER ALL, STOP THE CAR. BUT THEY NEVER FELT TRULY SECURE. IN THE LAST 2 YEARS, THE SOFTNESS PROGRESSED SLOWLY AT FIRST, AND THEN WORSENING WITH AN INCREASING RATE OF DECLINE. AT THE START OF JULY 2013, I WAS ALARMED TO FIND THAT I NEEDED TO PUMP THE BRAKES FOR THEM TO ENGAGE AND STOP THE CAR. ON 7/3/2013 THE MECHANIC I SAW FOUND THAT AIR WAS IN THE LINES, AND THAT THIS APPARENTLY HAD LET THE RIGHT REAR PADS STAY IN CONTACT WITH THE DISC REQUIRING SERVICING OF THAT PORTION OF THE SYSTEM. HE ALERTED ME THAT A DEFECTIVE BRAKE MODULATOR PROBLEM WAS KNOWN TO AFFECT MANY TLS OF THAT TIME PERIOD. AS IT IS AN EXPENSIVE PART AND NOT YET RECALLED, WE OPTED TO BLEED THE LINES AND FIX THE OTHER DAMAGE HOPING IT WOULD TURN OUT THAT THE LINE HAD SIMPLY LEAKED SOMEHOW. THE DRIVE AWAY WAS THE FIRST & ONLY TIME I'VE EVER FELT SOLID BRAKES ON THIS CAR. BUT BEFORE I'D REACHED MY HOME 10 MILES AWAY, THEY'D BECOME SPONGY. BY THE NEXT DAY I NEEDED TO PUMP THEM. CLEARLY, THE MODULATOR IS INTRODUCING AIR TO THE LINES. I ESSENTIALLY SET THE CAR ASIDE WHILE DECIDING WHETHER I SHOULD REPLACE IT OR FIX IT. I'M ABOUT TO REPLACE THE MODULATOR AT MY EXPENSE AS I'VE DECIDED I'M NOT PREPARED TO BUY A NEW CAR AFTER ALL, BUT THE BRAKES MUST BE MADE SAFE. ACURA HAS ISSUED A BULLETIN, BUT THEY'VE NOT ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELLING NEW CARS WITH A DEFECTIVE PART THAT COMPLETELY FAILS, EVENTUALLY. THE PROBLEM THEY'VE IMPOSED ON THE PUBLIC IS SERIOUS. PLEASE DON'T WAIT FOR THERE TO BE A DEATH BEFORE REQUIRING A RECALL OF THE  PART BY ACURA. THANK YOU.  *TR",

THEY OPENED UP A CASE AND TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED TO HAVE THE DEALER INSPECT IT.     I TOOK MY CAR TO THE CARLSBAD DEALER ON TUESDAY JULY 23RD AND HAD IT INSPECTED BY ONE OF THE SERVICE MANAGERS. HE GLANCED AT IT AND ABRUPTLY STATED I WILL NEED A NEW DASH AND THAT MY CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY SO I WILL HAVE TO PAY $1500.    LATER THAT DAY I SPOKE WITH CLIENT RELATIONS AND WAS TOLD 'WE ARE SORRY FOR YOUR ISSUE AND ACURA WILL PROVIDE ASSISTANCE WITH THE COST. THE WORK CAN BE DONE FOR $800'    BELIEVING THAT THE PART MAY BE FAULTY MAKES ME QUESTION WHY I HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING. I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED THAT I WAS DISMISSED SO QUICKLY BECAUSE MY CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY.

I REALIZED THEN THAT THE CAR WOULDN'T MOVE IN ANY GEAR I SHIFTED IT TO, WHICH IS INDICATES TO ME OF A FAILURE RELATING TO TRANSMISSION, IF NOT A FAILURE IN THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION ITSELF THAT CAUSED THIS VERY DANGEROUS INCIDENT TO HAPPEN. I HAD TO CALL AAA TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO MY DRIVEWAY WHERE IT STILL IS AS OF THIS WRITING. I HAD NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF ANY TRANSMISSION PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR NOR SHOULD SUSPECT OF SUCH SINCE I'VE BEEN CURRENT WITH ALL SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE SERVICES AND KEPT IT IN GOOD CONDITION AT ALL TIMES. ON NOV. 24, THREE DAYS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT, I BROUGHT THE CAR TO ACURA TO MAKE SURE I HAD THE 'POWER-STEERING HOSE RECALL' SERVICE DONE SINCE DAYS PRIOR I'VE BEEN HEARING UNUSUAL GRINDING NOISE AROUND STEERING WHEEL, AMPLIFIED UPON TURNING EVEN SLIGHTLY THE STEERING WHEEL ON EITHER DIRECTION, USUALLY WHEN THE CAR IS STARTED THE FIRST TIME. I THOUGHT THE NOISE I HEARING MIGHT BE RELATED TO THIS 'RECALL' SERVICE. HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO ACURA THAT SERVICE HAD BEEN DONE ON MY CAR LAST FEBRUARY 2008, BUT IT WOULD COST ME $110 FOR THEM TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM FOR WHICH I OPTED THEM NOT TO SINCE I DIDN'T HAVE THE FUNDS.

I PULLED THE CAR IN THE PARKING LOT AND TRIED TO PUT OUT THE FIRE WITH MY JACKET BUT IT ONLY GREW BIGGER. A STANDING BY POLICE OFFICER NOTICED THE INCIDENT AND PULLED ME AWAY FROM THE CAR. 911WAS CALLED AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED IN 2 MINUTES. THE CAR BURNED DURING THAT TIME. THE FIREMEN WERE ABLE TO PUT OUT THE FIRE.     ACURA IS REFUSING TO ACCEPT THIS AS POTENTIAL DEFECT IN THEIR CAR. THIS IS CLEARLY AN EXAMPLE OF A BADLY MANUFACTURED VEHICLE THAT JEOPARDIZED MY LIFE AND THE LIFE OF PEOPLE AROUND THE CAR.
