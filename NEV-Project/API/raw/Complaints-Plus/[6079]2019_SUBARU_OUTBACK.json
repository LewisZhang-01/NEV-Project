This problem first surfaced within weeks of new car purchase and took about 6-months and several visits to dealer to remedy. I also replaced the oem battery with a new upgraded battery at my own expense. Recently the problem reoccurred as the DCM module again failed and created a parasitic drain. This has probably damaged the new battery which is only a year old as it was completely discharged. The dealer again fixed the problem but as before was initially skeptical that it was caused by user error or letting vehicle sit too long between use; both of the most problematic failures occurred when the vehicle was left parked for 2-weeks at parksleepfly hotels while on trips and returned to find dead battery.",

        "summary": "My 2019 Outback has had 2 incidents where the battery was dead without an explanation.  There are 24000 miles on it.  The most recent incident occurred less than a week after the dealer serviced the vehicle.  The service included a battery test and I was told it tested good.  The car was parked in my home garage, and from all indications, no lights were left on, doors/tailgates open etc.  This was confirmed when the Subaru STARLINK roadside assistance provider came to jump the vehicle. Immediately after the vehicle was started, I took it to the dealer and requested a battery check.  They showed the battery was good but deeply discharged, so left it on a charger for over an hour while I waited.  In speaking to the service representative at the Subaru dealer, I was told that on new cars, alternators no longer charge a battery, but simply  maintain the existing charge level.  They claimed that a light or something of that nature was left on, a door left open, etc. I am certain this was not the case, as I keep all interior light switches in the off position, and once the vehicle was charged, no lights were on.  Also, no doors were open or ajar when this happened.  I requested they check the electrical system to diagnose the cause of the battery drain, but they explained this would not be covered under warranty since the battery had tested ok.  The dealer recommended that I keep a trickle charger on it when parked at home to prevent recurrences.  I don\u2019t feel this is an acceptable solution for a vehicle that is merely two years old with minimal miles and fully under warranty.  While I was inconvenienced by this and had to arrange a ride to an appointment as a result, it did not create an immediate safety issue (this time). A similar set of circumstances occurred in late March of 2021 when I was out of town visiting a family member.  At that time, I also was not able to determine a cause. Since that was the first occurrence, it didn\u2019t create the same level of concern.",

Twice it was from leaving the hatch up for a couple of hours, once we were driving out in the country and parked to look at the scenery briefly and the battery died leaving us stuck out in the middle of nowhere. It didn't feel safe to be out there as night was approaching and we were waiting for a tow truck.  All in all had to call SUBARU Roadside Assistance and have the battery jumped on three or four separate occasions. Because of this we bought a portable battery charger to keep in the car at all times because we were afraid of getting stuck with a dead battery. We ended up needing to use that battery charger on about 3 different occasions. Eventually the electrical system started acting very erratic with spontaneous alarms, loud chirping sounds and door locks so we took it in to Southern Oregon SUBARU who replaced the battery for us. Changing the battery seemed to fix all of the problems. That was in February 2021. The battery had a 30 month warranty. This week on June 1,  2021 we came back from vacation where we had left the SUBARU safely parked in our driveway. It would not start when we returned. We only have 1 vehicle so this was very inconvenient for us.  The battery was dead. We tried to charge it with our battery charger but the battery was just too dead to take a charge. So, we had one night without a vehicle. We called SUBARU roadside assistance and they sent out a tow truck driver who could not get the battery jumped because it was so dead it just would not start. That was our second night without a vehicle. The next afternoon SUBARU roadside service sent out another towbtruck driver who had a more powerful battery charger and he was able to get the battery to start. We drove the SUBARU OUTBACK to Southern Oregon SUBARU and they are working on it now.",

I asked for a replacement but was quoted over 2k for the replacement.  This is just wrong and Subaru needs to replace these seats.

After 5 times of having to jump the battery to start vehicle, I had to purchase a Battery Booster to keep in the car. At first visit to my Subaru Dealership, a completely dead battery was found and replaced under warranty. Battery continued to die, sometimes after being in the garage for up to one week [when a boost was required], and once after a 76 mile highway trip, it was dead again after one full day parked. There have been 2-3 occasions when it seems to be related to operation of the liftgate. Liftgate becomes inoperative and must be manually opened and recycled and battery jumped for engine start. A second visit to the Dealership determined all in working condition after a full diagnostic check. Car is working normally at this time, one week after Dealership checkout. As this seems to be a frequent issue with other Subaru owners, I am carrying my Battery Booster on board at all times. This seems to be a known issue [by Subaru] for 2017-2019 models. Otherwise, I love the Outback, but this annoying issue is disconcerting, to say the least.",

In our recent  living environment we can park cars outside in spaces, and in a large underground parking garage. While we did not drive much, I still needed to work on bicycles using tools stored in the rear trunk compartment, with the trunk lid in open position. What I did not know was that even the mere open car trunk was run electrically, though the large electronic dashboard gave a clue of a rather massive reliance on functions run electronically; after a mere 2-3 days of not driving we were made rudely aware that keeping the trunk lid open for any amount of time was a recipe for not being able to use the car when most needed; I should add here that the many Subaru drivers in our complex did not seem to have that problem as they are all  \"professional\" drivers.  We called our designated towing service and had to wait for over 3 hours for a rep to show up. Not having bought a car in years we were amazed how quickly the tow driver pulled out an electronic gadget and started the car. It immediately bought one like that, an electronic jump starter.   SAFETY. Had my wife had to find transportation to an urgent appointment it would have become a safety problem.  PROBLEM CONFIRMATION. No, it has not, except by me, as any greater than fleeting use of electricity in this car is a recipe for disaster. COMPONENT INSPECTED. Yes. After 2 more battery outages I took the car to the dealer and  explained the problem (which had little impact on the employee). I had the battery checked,   it was fine and working as designed. On 9/25/21, after another  battery outage I took the car to the dealer again; again everything was operating as designed. SYMPTOMS OF THE PROBLEM. No. ASSESSMENT.  I concluded I needed to keep the car RUNNING when using any function more than 5 minutes.  This car is  a computer on wheels.",

I CANNOT PUSH IT TO THE SIDE SINCE THE DRIVING WHEEL IS VERY HARD TO MOVE AND THE CAR STALLED IN THE MIDDLE LANE OF THREE LANES HIGHWAY RAMP.  I HAD TO WAIT FOR TOW TRUCK TO COME TO GET OFF THE HIGHWAY AND IT WAS TOWED BACK TO MY HOME SINCE THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE SHOP IS CLOSED ON SUNDAY.

HE AGREED THAT WHAT OCCURRED SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITH THE CAR BEING PRETTY MUCH BRAND NEW. WHEN I WENT INTO THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT THIS ISSUE, THEY SAID THEY WERE NOT AWARE AT ALL OF ANY ISSUES WITH THEIR VEHICLES' WINDSHIELDS AND THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER HAPPENING BEFORE. THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED WHEN THIS OCCURRED. IT WAS A WARM DAY, WITH THE AIR TEMPERATURE WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED SITTING AROUND 91-93F ACCORDING TO THE KOUN WEATHER STATION. THE WARM TEMPERATURES MIGHT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROBLEM WEAKENING THE POINT OF CONTACT WITH THE GLUE AND THE WINDSHIELD.

WITHIN MINUTES THE CRACK EXPANDED TO MORE THAN A FOOT LONG. WITHIN DAYS THE CRACK EXPANDED TO BE MORE THAN TWO FEET LONG. I HAD THE WINDSHIELD REPLACED AT THE SUBARU DEALERSHIP BY A THIRD-PARTY GLASS REPAIR BUSINESS (THAT CARTER SUBARU OF BALLARD USES FOR ALL GLASS REPLACEMENT). AFTER THE PART WAS INSTALLED, SUBARU HAD TO RECALIBRATE THE EYESIGHT CAMERAS TO ENSURE THE VEHICLE WAS SAFE TO DRIVE. THE WINDSHIELD REPLACEMENT ($748.58) AND THE RECALIBRATION ($345.45) TOTALED $1,0494.03.
