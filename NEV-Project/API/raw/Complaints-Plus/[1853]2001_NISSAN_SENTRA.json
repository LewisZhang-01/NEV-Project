My recent incident occurs on 2/17/22 while driving on a freeway at 70mph that left me stranded. I had it towed to the nearest auto mechanics. While the engines shuts down, the Service Engine Soon light came on followed by the Battery Icon and Oil Lamp Icon. In the past I had most if not all my catalytic converters and O2 sensors replaced but the problem persisted. Some mechanics stated it was electrical but offered no solution. I did had an oil changed and battery tested a week earlier but no issue was found. My most recent mechanic checked it out and told me it's not the battery nor the alternator, they're both still good. I had to leave my car over the weekends for a full diagnostic.",

I STATED THAT BECAUSE THE CAR STALLED WHILE DRIVING THAT PUT PEOPLE?S LIVES AT RISK. I ASKED THE NISSAN REPRESENTATIVE [XXX] IF THERE HAVE BEEN ANY OTHER COMPLAINTS WITH THIS CAR'S MODEL ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE CRANKSHAFT AND CAMSHAFT SENSORS ARE STILL FAILING.

ON THE LATEST BREAK IT HAS BECOME LODGED INSIDE THE STEM.  FROM WHAT I CAN GATHER THE STANDARD FEE MOST MECHANICS AND DEALERSHIPS RANGE FROM $120.00 TO $300.00 FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE OIL STICK.  THE PROBLEM WITH THE DESIGN OF THE STICK IS THAT IT HAS A COMPLETELY PLASTIC HANDLE THAT EXTENDS FOR A WAYS BEFORE JOINING WITH THE METAL STICK.  ON BOTH OCCASIONS THE STICK BREAKS WELL ABOVE WHERE IT JOINS WITH THE METAL COMPONENT THEREFORE MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE WITH A MAGNET.  THIS SAME PROBLEM HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED NUMEROUS TIMES ONLINE AND I SEE IT AS A PROBLEM THAT NISSAN CONTINUES TO SELL THIS OIL STICK.

WE FINALLY TOOK IT IN TO OUR LOCAL MECHANIC AND HE CALLED SAYING THE HORN WORKS, THE FUSE IS FINE AND THE RELAY WORKS, BUT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE FUSE AND THE RELAY, IT'S LOSING POWER; LIKELY A SHORT IN THE WIRE. BUT THEY SAID IT IS WIRED IN SUCH A CONVOLUTED WAY THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER 2 HOURS TO FIND THE RIGHT WIRE AND FIX.  I FOUND THIS IN AN INTERNET MESSAGE BOARD:  \"JUST CURIOUS IF ANY OTHERS HAVE ISSUES WITH THEIR 00-06 SENTRA HORNS...MEANING YOU HIT YOUR HORN OR KEY FOB AND NO SOUND FROM THE HORN? I HAD MY 2001 SE FIXED AROUND 60,XXX...FOUND OUT FROM NISSAN THAT THE WIRES ARE A BIT SHORT RUNNING TO THE HORN SPEAKER...I THINK THE WIRING GOES UNDER THE RADIATOR. IT GETS STRESSED AND RUBS SOMEWHERE AND DUE TO CORROSION OR TOTAL BREAKAGE THE HORN THEN NO LONGER FUNCTIONS. THE PART I'M PISSED ABOUT IS THAT NOW AT 68K THE PROBLEM IS ONCE AGAIN BACK. I KNOW ACCORDING TO MY FATHER WHO USE TO WORK FOR A COMPANY THAT PROVIDES TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO PRIVATE GARAGES AROUND THE U.S. THAT THIS IN FACT IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THESE SENTRA'S, BUT ACCORDING TO NISSAN DOES NOT REQUIRE AN NTSB. SAFETY FEATURE IN MY OPINION. NISSAN SAYS I'LL HAVE TO BRING IT IN AND PAY FOR DIAGNOSIS. I THINK I CALL THE REGIONAL MANAGER. TWICE I'VE HAD SOMEONE ALMOST HIT ME AND I HAVE NO HORN.    ''NISSAN SAID CHECK THE FUSE...THEIR TYPICAL RESPONSE. AFTER TALKING AT LENGTH TO THE NISSAN DEALER THAT LAST FIXED THIS ISSUE THEY FINALLY GAVE UP AND SAID IT SOUNDED LIKE THE SAME ISSUE WAS BACK.\"    AFTER THIS, I CALLED MY LOCAL NISSAN REPAIR SHOP (517 393-5700) AND SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER. AFTER TELLING HIM THE PROBLEM, HE PUT ME ON HOLD AND CHECKED THEIR RECORDS. HE INDICATED TO ME THAT YES, THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH THIS MAKE/MODEL OF NISSAN, BUT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING NISSAN NOR THEY COULD DO RE: FIXING THE HORN WHICH IS CAUSED BY AN ADMITTEDLY POORLY DESIGNED HORN WIRING SYSTEM. *JB",

THE PART IS ONLY AVAILABLE FROM A NISSAN DEALERSHIP, AND COSTS $488.19 PLUS A HALF HOUR OF LABOR FOR INSTALLATION!!!  THE NEW PART ALSO NEEDS TO BE SYNCHED UP WITH THE CAR'S COMPUTER BECAUSE ITS DIFFERENT THAN THE OLD PART SINCE NISSAN KNOWS THAT THE OLD PART IS NO GOOD.

IT WAS VERY HARD TO STEER WHILE TRAVELING THAT SPEED AND TO GET ACROOS THE TRAFFIC SO I COULD PULL OFF OF THE HIGHWAY. I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO PAT PECK NISSAN IN GULFPORT, MISSISSIPPI. THEY FIXED THE CAR AND SAID THAT IT WAS THE CRANK POSITION SENSOR. I ASKED IF THERE WAS A RECALL ON THIS AND THEY SAID NO. AFTER I GOT HOME I LOOKED ON YOUR WEBSITE AND FOUND THAT THERE IS A RECALL ON THIS FOR THE 2001 NISSAN SENTRA MANUFACTURED ON JANUARY 2000 THROUGH MAY 2001. THE MANUFACTURED DATE ON MY CAR IS APRIL OF 2001. I CALLED NISSAN AND THEY SAID THAT MY CAR DID NOT QUALIFY FOR THE RECALL. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IF MY CAR IS IN THE MANUFACTURED DATE WHY IT DOES NOT QUALIFY. THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT, NOT ONLY ME BUT THE OTHER DRIVERS AROUND ME. PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AND SEE IF THE RECALL WAS OVERLOOKED BEFORE SOMEONE IS SERIOUS INJURED. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. KEVIN CARPENTER   DT",

IN OUR CASE, WE COULD NOT STOP THE VEHICLE AND HAD TO SHUT OFF THE ENGINE TO STOP OUR FORWARD MOTION.  THE DATABASE SUMMARIES SHOW THE DEALER RESPONSE IS ALWAYS THE SAME - WE CAN'T REPLICATE, THEREFORE WE CAN'T FIX.

PLEASE BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS PROBLEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND FORCE NISSAN TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM, DETERMINE ITS CAUSE AND RECALL THE VEHICLES.

MY VEHICLE WAS TOTALED, AND ALL OF THE DAMAGE WAS IN THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE, WITH THE LIGHT POLE RESTING IN THE CENTER OF THE HOOD.  EVERYONE AT THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT STATED THAT THE AIRBAGS SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED.  THE POLICE, FIRE DEPT., AND AMBULANCE WOULDN'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO GET ME OUT OF THE VEHICLE UNTIL THE BATTERY WAS DISCONNECTED FOR FEAR THAT THE BAGS WOULD DEPLOY IN ATTEMPT TO GET ME OUT.  I WANT TO KNOW WHY THEY DIDN'T DEPLOY, AND I WANT SOMETHING DONE ABOUT IT.  I LOVE MY EXTERRA, BUT IF EVER THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER ACCIDENT, I (OR SOMEONE ELSE) MAY NOT BE AS FORTUNATE TO SURVIVE THE CRASH.*AK",
