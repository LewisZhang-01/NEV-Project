ON REMOVING THE GAS GAUGE SENDER/FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY FROM THE GASOLINE TANK, I NOTICED THAT TWO OF THE WIRES WERE FUSED TOGETHER.  SEPARATING THE WIRES TOOK SOME EFFORT AND REVEALED THAT THE INSULATION ON BOTH WIRES HAD COMPLETELY ABRADED WHERE THEY CONTACTED EACH OTHER SUCH THAT THE BARE WIRES INSIDE TOUCHED EACH OTHER AND SHORTED OUT THE CIRCUIT.

REPLACEMENT OF THE ENTIRE FUEL PUMP/GAS GAUGE SENDER SOLVED THE PROBLEM.

THE METAL WIRES DO NOT APPEAR TO HAVE MELTED OR FUSED; ONLY THE INSULATION DID THAT.  BUT THE INSULATION MELTING AND FUSION, AS WELL AS THE TWO SAFETY FUSES THAT BLEW, ARGUE THAT THE ABRASION OF THE INSULATION CONTINUED UNTIL THE WIRES INSIDE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER.

THIS ISSUE OCCURRED INTERMITTENTLY FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, ALWAYS AT LOW SPEEDS, WITH A REPAIR SHOP BEING UNABLE TO LOCATE THE PROBLEM.  AFTER SEVERAL CLOSE CALLS, IT WAS EVENTUALLY TRACED TO A CORRODED BRAKE LINE IN THE FRONT DRIVER AREA OF THE VEHICLE ONLY AFTER THE LINE RUPTURED COMPLETELY AND I MISSED GOING THROUGH THE FENCE SEPARATING MY YARD FROM THE NEIGHBORS BY JUST INCHES.  THAT LINE WAS REPLACED, BUT WITH A USED PART BECAUSE THE LOCAL DEALER REFUSED TO SELL AN EXACT FIT BRAKE LINE AND THE MECHANIC WAS UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE ORIGINAL PART BY HAND.  THE BRAKE FLUID WAS ALWAYS WITHIN THE ACCEPTABLE RANGE, AND THE BRAKE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON ONLY WHILE THE BRAKES WERE ACTIVELY FAILING.  IT WOULD TURN OFF AS SOON AS I TOOK MY FOOT OFF OF THE BRAKE.    FAST FORWARD TO AUGUST 2015 - I'M COMING TO A STOP IN A DRIVEWAY, AND THE PEDAL SUDDENLY SINKS COMPLETELY TO THE FLOOR, THE BRAKE LIGHT COMES ON, AND THE VEHICLE DOES NOT STOP.  THE VEHICLE STOPPED AFTER STEPPING ON THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, AND I CHECKED THE BRAKE FLUID.  IT WAS FULL.

AFTER REMOVING THE GUARD A SMALL PINHOLE LEAK WAS DETECTED IN THE TANK. THE TANK HAD RUSTED THROUGH DUE TO AN INABILITY OF WATER, SALT, AND DEBRIS TO BE CLEARED FROM THE GUARD BECAUSE IT CONTAINS NO DRAIN HOLES. I REPAIRED THE TANK WITH AN OVER THE COUNTER REPAIR KIT DUE TO THE NEED OF THE VEHICLE. I CONTACTED CHEVROLET BUT WAS TOLD THAT SINCE I FIXED THE TANK MYSELF THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO FOR ME. ON 11/07/04 I AGAIN NOTICED GAS FUMES IN THE GARAGE. UPON LOOKING I DISCOVERED TWO NEW HOLES RUSTED THROUGH THE TANK. AT THIS POINT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE I FEAR THE TANK IS RUSTED TOO THIN TO RELY ON FOR SAFETY REASONS. I BELIEVE A GENERAL ENGINEERING OVERSIGHT WOULD ALLOW A PLASTIC BOWL SHAPED GUARD TO BE STRAPPED BELOW A METAL TANK WITHOUT AT LEAST SOME DRAIN HOLES TO ALLOW WATER TO ESCAPE. I'M WRITING BECAUSE WE KEEP THE SUBURBAN IN EXCELLENT REPAIR AND I'M POSSITIVE THERE ARE OTHER SUCH DESIGNED TANKS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. *AK",

IT IS MY DESIRE THAT THE NHTSA ALLOW THAT SUIT TO PROCEED AND STAND ON ITS OWN MERIT IN THE COURTS.    I BOUGHT A NEW 1999 CHEVROLET SUBURBAN IN NOV OF 1999 WHICH CAME EQUIPPED WITH FOUR LT245-75R-16 FIRESTONE STEELTEX TIRES ON THE GROUND AND ONE SPARE. THIS VEHICLE WAS 100% DEALER MAINTAINED AND NEVER RAN OFF OF PAVED ROADS. IT PRIMARILY TRAVELED FROM THE LA AREA OR LAS VEGAS TO LAKE TAHOE. I HAVE HOMES IN ALL THREE AREAS AND TRAVEL BETWEEN THEM. DURING THE COURSE OF THESE TRIPS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, I HAVE HAD THREE HIGH SPEED BLOWOUTS AND TWO TIRE TREAD SEPARATIONS. THAT IS FIVE FOR FIVE OF THE TIRES FIRESTONE BUILT AND WERE DELIVERED ON MY VEHICLE. I AM IN MY MID 60\u0019S AND HAVE DRIVEN AUTO\u0019S SINCE I WAS 16 AND HAVE NEVER HAD THIS TYPE OF SUBSTANDARD PERFORMANCE ON ANY AUTO THAT I HAVE EVER OWNED.    MY MAJOR DISSATISFACTION AND THE REASON FOR THIS LETTER IS THE TOTAL DISREGARD FIRESTONE ACKNOWLEDGED IN ANY OF MY SEVERAL LETTERS OF LOSS CLAIM WITH THEM. TO THIS DATE, ALL I EVER RECEIVED FROM FIRESTONE WAS ASSURANCE THEIR PRODUCT WAS SAFE AND THAT ANY PROBLEMS THAT I WAS HAVING WAS THE FAULT OF MY MISUSE OF THEIR PRODUCT. THIS TOTAL DISREGARD FOR CONSUMER SAFETY AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION NEEDS CORRECTING OR THIS COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DO BUSINESS IN OUR COUNTRY.

ACCORDING TO THE REPRESENTATIVES AT THE 800-NUMBER PROVIDED IN THE OWNER'S MANUAL, CHEVROLET DOES NOT HAVE PERMANENT ANCHORS FOR THE SECOND ROW.  INSTEAD, THEY HAVE A LITTLE METAL PLATE (IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THE LATCH PLATE PART OF THE REGULAR SEAT BELT) THAT HOOKS INTO THE BUCKLE FOR THE THIRD ROW.  THIS MEANS SEVERAL THINGS:  WITH A TETHERED CHILD RESTRAINT IN THE SECOND ROW, YOU LOSE A SEATING SPOT IN THE THIRD ROW, YOU CAN'T LOWER THE THIRD ROW TO INCREASE CARGO SPACE, YOU CAN'T REMOVE THE THIRD ROW TO INCREASE CARGO SPACE, AND THE TETHER STRAP DOES NOT GO STRAIGHT BACK BUT INSTEAD GOES AT AN ANGLE.  THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THIS ADD-ON DEVICE ARE UNCLEAR, BUT THEY SEEM TO INDICATE THAT IF YOU HAVE THREE TETHERED CHILD RESTRAINTS IN THE SECOND ROW, TWO OF THEM MUST SHARE ONE TETHER ANCHOR FOR THE CENTER REAR SEAT.

I REQUESTED MY VEHICLE HAVE A DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION CONDUCTED, AS I WANTED TO KNOW WHY THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. I HAVE BASICALLY BEEN TOLD BY GMC THAT \u001cIF THE AIRBAG LIGHT IS FUNCTIONING IN THE DASHBOARD OF MY TRUCK THEN THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY AIR BAGS\u001d PER A CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGER AND THAT MY ACCIDENT DID NOT, \u001cMEET THE CRITERIA\u001d FOR AIR BAG DEPLOYMENT. I HIGHLY DISAGREE WITH GMC\u0019S EXPLANATION AND CRITICIZE THE LACK OF PROFESSIONAL DIPLOMACY AND CONCERN. I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED MORE FROM ONE OF THE \u001cBIG 3\u001d AUTO CORPORATIONS. MY VEHICLE STRUCK A TREE WITH ENOUGH FORCE TO BEND THE FRONT LEFT FRAME RAIL. THE IMPACT ALSO WAS GREAT ENOUGH TO RAISE THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE OF THE GROUND AND SET IT DOWN A FOOT TO THE LEFT OF THE INITIAL IMPACT. THIS HAS ALSO LEFT ME WITH DOCUMENTED INJURIES CAUSING ME TO BE UNABLE TO WORK. MY CONFIDENCE IN THIS VEHICLE\u0019S AIR BAG SYSTEM HAS DIMINISHED TO SAY THE LEAST. THIS MATTER HAS NOT BEEN HANDLED NOR COMPLETED TO MY SATISFACTION. I EXPECTED AT LEAST AN OFFERING TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TAKEN TO A LOCAL DEALERSHIP TO HAVE A DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION CONDUCTED. THIS WOULD ALLOW ME TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE WITH SOME CONFIDENCE THAT THE SYSTEM WOULD WORK IN THE EVENT I NEED IT AGAIN. I AM AT A STAND STILL AND I AM POSITIVE I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM IN THE PAST.  I WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION RELATED TO FAILED AIR BAG DEPLOYMENT AND GMC CHEVY SURBURBAN.

THE SECOND BATTERY WOULD NOT STAY HOOKED UP TO THE WIRING HARNESS AND CAUSED NUMEROUS FAILURE TO START PROBLEMS(WHEN THE CAR WAS ONLY TWO YEARS OLD).  THE MOST DISTRESSING PROBLEM WAS THE RECENT REPLACEMENT OF TRANSMISSION AT ONLY 70,000 MILES.  THE CAR JERKED BETWEEN SECOND AND THIRD GEARS, MADE NOISES AND RATTLES. RED LIQUID WAS LEAKING ONTO MY GARAGE FLOOR.  THE CAR WAS TOWED TO CAPITOL CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP IN AUSTIN.  I REVIEWED MY PROBLEM AND TOLD THEM I THOUGHT I HAD A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM.  THEY DECIDED IT WAS AN ENGINE COOLANT SEAL PROBLEM AND PERFORMED A 600.00 REPAIR.  I PICKED THE CAR UP AND DROVE ONE BLOCK AND THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED.  THE CAR WAS DRIVEN BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP, AND WE WERE THEN TOLD OUR TRANSMISSION WAS \"BURNED UP\".  I THINK IT IS RIDICULOUS THAT A CAR WOULD NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION AFTER 70,000 MILES.

I BROUGHT THE TRUCK BACK UNDER CONTROL AND PULLED OVER TO THE SHOULDER AND GOT OUT.  I WALKED AROUND TO THE FRONT RIGHT SIDE AND THE TIRE HAD SEPARATED, IT DIDN'T GO FLAT.  THEN EXACTLY A WEEK LATER I HAD THE LEFT FRONT TIRE BLOWOUT.  THIS TIRE WAS IN PIECES.  AFTER THE FIRST SEPARATION I CALLED FIRESTONE AND WAS TOLD TO TAKE IT TO A FIRESTONE DEALER IN MY AREA TO HAVE THE REST OF THE TIRES LOOKED AT.  I DID THAT I TOOK IT TO TED WIENS ON WARM SPRINGS.  AT THAT TIME I SPOKE WITH COURTNEY  HE CAME OUT LOOKED AT THE FIRST TIRE AND SAID SINCE I WAS CLAIMING PRODUCT LIABILITY FOR THE DAMAGE TO MY TRUCK HE SAID ALL HE WOULD DO IS REPLACE THE TIRE AND NOTHING MORE.  I ASKED HIM TO PLEASE LOOK AT THE OTHERS HE TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING MORE HE COULD DO.  SO I LEFT BOUGHT THE TIRE SOMEWHERE ELSE AND HAD IT MOUNTED AND THE OTHERS CHECKED.  I WAS TOLD AT THAT TIME THE TIRES SEEMDED FINE NO SIDWALL DAMAGE AND PLENTY OF TREAD.  THEN I HAVE THE 2ND SEPERATION.  I WENT BACK TO TED WIENS AND SPOKE TO THE OWNER CARLOS.  HE TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE BACK LOOKED AT THE REMAING 2 TIRES SAID THE TREAD WAS AT 10/32 NO SIDE WALL DAMAGE AND CALLED FIRESTONE.  FIRESTONE TOLD HIM SINCE THE TIRES HAD NO CRACKING THEY WOULD DO NOTHING.  HE DID REPLACE THESE TIRES FOR ME.  FIRESTONE WOULD NOT.  I FEEL LET DOWN BOTH BY FIRESTONE AND CHEVROLET.

THE WAS A \"KLUNK\" AS SHE WAS TRAVELLING 70MPH ON I-65. THERE WAS A DEALERSHIP IN SIGHT, SO I HAD IT TOWED THERE, AND THE FOLLOWING MONDAY I CALLED TO GET AN ESTIMATE. I WAS TOLD THE REAR END HOUSING HAD A HOLE BLOWN THROUGH IT. THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME $1,900 FOR A USED REAR END, AND $250 FOR LABOR. THE LABOR SOUNDED REASONABLE, BUT THE $1,900 WAS OUTRAGEOUS. I CONTACTED THE CHEVY DEALER IN PENSACOLA AND LOCATED A USED REAR END WITH A 12 MONTH PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY FOR $1,200, SO I CALLED A FLAT BED WRECKER AND PAID $220 TO HAVE TOWED TO PENSACOLA FOR REPAIR. I CALLED CHEVY CUSTOMER SERVICE AND FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE GREENVILLE DEALER AND ON THE VEHICLE ITSELF (FILE #C04557412). THE FIRST CR I SPOKE WITH TOOK THE INFORMATION, BUT WAS NOT VERY HELPFUL BEYOND THAT. MY OWN MECHANIC WHO REPAIRED THE VEHICLE EXAMINED THE REAR END AND SAID IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS NO SEAL OR LEAKAGE PROBLEM BUT THAT SOMETHING INSIDE JUST GAVE OUT AND WENT THROUGH THE HOUSING. WE HAD OWNED A \u001293, C2500 THAT HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE REAR END SEAL AFTER 140,000 MILES, AND THAT IS A LITTLE MORE UNDERSTANDABLE, BUT 72,000 MILES SEEMS LIKE A VERY PREMATURE DEATH FOR A REAR END TO INCUR AN INTERNAL FAILURE. I CALLED CHEVY CUSTOMER SERVICE BACK AND SPOKE WITH A JUDY FRANCO. I TOLD HER WHAT THE MECHANIC SAID ABOUT THE REAR END AND SHE SAID THEY WOULD LOOK INTO IT FURTHER. SHE REPORTED DOING SOME INVESTIGATING AND SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING CHEVY WOULD DO. SHE AND A SERVICE REP IN PENSACOLA SAID THEY DOUBTED THAT CHEVY WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR ME BECAUSE OF THE MILEAGE, AND BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE IT REPAIRED AT THE DEALERSHIP. ALTHOUGH THE REP IN PENSACOLA TOLD ME THAT IF THE VEHICLE WAS UNDER 60,000 MILES THAT, IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT SOMETHING COULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE WAY OF COMPENSATION.*AK",

SINCE THE START OF MY OWNERSHIP OF THE 1999 3/4 TON CHEVY SUBURBAN, I HAVE NOT BEEN HAPPY WITH THE BRAKING SYSTEM.  WHEN I AM APPLYING THE BRAKES COMING OVER TRAIN TRACKS OR ROUGH ROAD THE BRAKES MAKE A GRAONING NOISE.  IT ONLY SEEMS TO HAPPEN GOING OVER ROUGH ROAD AND TRACKS AND IF I HAVE TO COME TO A SUDDEN STOP.  I BELIEVE THE BRAKES ARE DRUM BRAKES, WHICH SEEMS TO BE \"OLD\" TECHNOLOGY.   I THINK THE NEWEST TECHNOLOGY FOR SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES IS SEEN IN THE FORD EXPEDITION...DISK BRAKES.  I THINK THESE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IN A VEHICLE WEIGHING 3/4 TON, BECAUSE IT WOULD GIVE MORE STOPPING POWER TO THE DRIVER, AS IS ILLUSTRATED IN MOST OF THE CARS ON THE ROAD TODAY.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT ALL THE BRAKE PROBLEMS PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH THE GM SUBURBANS (CHEVY AND GMC), BUT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE, BEFORE SOMEONE GETS SERIOUSLY HURT!    I ALSO HAVE ANOTHER GREAT SUGGESTION....I HAD A 1993 CHEVY SUBURBAN AND A 1981 VW RABBIT CONVERTIBLE, AND BOTH HAD CAR FIRES...ERGO THE SUGGESTION TO HAVE THE MANUFACTURERS OF ALL VEHICLES, INCLUDE A FIRE EXTINGUISHER AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT ON A CAR.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP, AND I HOPE THIS TYPE OF NOTIFICATION GETS SOME ATTENTION!",
