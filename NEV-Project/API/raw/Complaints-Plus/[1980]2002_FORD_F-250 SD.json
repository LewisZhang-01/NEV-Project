THIS PROBLEM IS WIDESPREAD WITH THIS MODEL YEAR AND THERE ARE MANY REPORTS ON FORUMS AROUND THE INTERNET.  FORD HAS ALSO STOPPED MAKING THE ORIGINAL PART AND REPLACED ITS MANUFACTURE WITH A NEW PART WHICH SUPPOSEDLY DOES NOT EXHIBIT THE SAME RANDOM FAILURE RATE.    HEADLIGHTS NOT WORKING IS A MAJOR LIFE SAFETY ISSUE.  I DROVE WITHOUT HEADLIGHTS ON FOR SOME TIME (AS THE AUTO HEADLIGHTS DID NOT COME ON) AND DID NOT NOTICE IT UNTIL I WAS ON AN UNLIT STREET.    ALL OF THE OLD VSMS SHOULD BE CHANGED TO THE NEW MODEL FREE OF CHARGE TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING.  *TR",

I IMMEDIATELY SHUT THE TRUCK OFF AND OPENED THE HOOD, AFTER SOME INVESTIGATION I WAS AMAZED TO SEE THAT A SPARK PLUG HAD COMPLETELY BLOWN OUT OF THE HEAD OF MY ENGINE. I WAS HAPPY TO SEE THAT THE FIRE WAS MINIMAL BUT I WAS COMPLETELY AMAZED THAT A PLUG BLEW OUT OF MY ENGINE.   ABOUT SEVEN OR SO DAYS AGO MY ENGINE STARTED TO MAKE A TAPPING NOISE UNDER THE HOOD, I KNEW THAT IT COULD BE A LIFTER BECAUSE OF THE OVER HEAD CAM BUT NOW I GUESS I KNOW WHAT THAT NOISE WAS, JUST THE GASES PUSHING THROUGH THE THREADS OF THE PLUG.  NO ONE WAS HURT AND MY TRUCK DIDN'T BURN TO THE GROUND, BUT I DID HAVE TO BORROW MY WIFE'S TRUCK ALL WEEK AND WORK OUT RIDES WHILE MINE WAS IN THE SHOP. I AM A CARPENTER AND NEED MY TRUCK EVERY DAY SO WHEN THIS HAPPENED I KNEW I HAD TO FIND INFORMATION ON THIS PROBLEM. I WAS AMAZED TO FIND THAT THERE WERE MANY PEOPLE I KNOW THAT THIS HAPPENED TO, SO I LOOKED INTO IT MORE AND FOUND THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT ON THE COMPUTER WITH THE EXACT SAME EXPERIENCE AS ME SOME WITH MORE DAMAGE AND SOME SAY IT HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES IN THE SAME ENGINE. THERE ARE MANY REPAIR KIT OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROBLEM IN THE FORD ENGINES, IT SEAMS QUITE OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM THAT FORD MUST BE RESPONSIBLE FOR, I KNOW I'M NOT I TAKE CARE OF MY TRUCK AND HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED IT AT HIGH LEVEL. FORD SAYS THAT THE PLUGS ARE BLOWING OUT BECAUSE OF IMPROPER TORQUING WELL I GUESS THEY MUST HAVE DONE THAT WRONG IN  THE PLANT WHEN THE TRUCK WAS BUILT BECAUSE THEY WERE NEVER CHANGED OR TOUCHED BY ANYONE ELSE.

THEY HAVE A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE USE OF STAINLESS STEEL STUDS AND NUTS IN SERVICE FOR THE 5.4 LITER AND 6.8 LITER ENGINE.

THERE HAVE BEEN COUNTLESS REPORTS OF SPARK PLUGS BLOWING AND EITHER PEOPLE BEING STRANDED TO NEAR COLLISIONS. ALSO I AM A FIREFIGHTERS PARAMEDIC AND MY NOSE IS NO HYDROCARBON METER BUT THE LEVELS OF GASOLINE VAPORS THAT ACCUMULATE IN A VERY SHORT TIME.

TWO WEEKS AGO I RETURNED FROM A 4000 TRIP TO YELLOWSTONE AND GLACIER NATIONAL PARKS.  ON THIS TRIP I TOWED A 9000 LB 5TH WHEEL WITH MY F250.

ON JULY 9, 2004 I HEARD A BRIEF TAPPING NOISE AND A POP THEN A LOUD NOISE LIKE AN EXHAUST MANIFOLD LEAK. IMMEDIATELY UPON HEARING THIS NOISE I SHUT OFF THE ENGINE AND CALLED A TOW TRUCK, AS I AM NOT A MECHANIC AND DID NOT WANT TO CREATE FURTHER DAMAGE. WHEN THE MECHANIC ARRIVED TO TOW MY TRUCK HE OBSERVED THAT A SPARK PLUG HAD BEEN BLOWN OUT OF THE CYLINDER. I INFORMED HIM TO TOW IT TO HIS LOT UNTIL I COULD DECIDE WHAT TO DO. THE NEXT DY I HAD THE TOW TRUCK COMPANY BRING MY TRUCK TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP I PURCHASED IT FROM. TODAY AFTER THE DEALERSHIP'S MECHANIC INSPECTED MY TRUCK THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE CYLINDER HEAD WAS BROKEN AND I WOULD BE LIABLE FOR THE $3,700.00 REPAIR. WHAT I FIND DISTUBING IS MY SCHEDULED SPARK PLUG REPLACEMENT SERVICE INTERVAL: FORD RECOMMENDS 100,000 MILES BEFORE REPLACEMENT.   HOW WOULD I EVER KNOW THAT THE SPEARK PLUG WAS NOT INSTALLED PROPERLY AT THE FACTORY PRIOR TO THE SCHEDULED SERVICE? ADDITIONALLY, HAD IT NOT BLOWN OUT ON ITS OWN, WHO KNOWS WHAT OTHER DAMAGES WOULD HAVE GONE UNCHECKED. I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS PARTICULAR DEFECT ON THE WEB AND HAVE FOUND NOT LESS THAN 100 PEOPLE THUS FAR WITH THE EXACT SAME COMPLAINT. ADDITIONALLY , I HAVE FOUND NUMEROUS PEOPLE THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO MORE THAN ONCE ON THE SAME ENGINE. I STOPPED RESEARCHING BECAUSE I FEEL THIS IS SUFFUCIENT SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION OF MY COMPLAINT. IF NECESSARY, I WILL BE HAPPY TO FURNISH THIS DOCUMENTATION FOR YOU. I HAVE FOUND THIS PROBLEM TO BE INHERENT IN ALL V10 FORD ENGINES SINCE 1999.

FURTHER, BECAUSE THE TRUCK WOULD NOT GENERATE A COMPUTER CODE SHOWING THE EXACT FAILURE MODE, THE FORD DEALERSHIP WAS INCAPABLE OF DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM, AS THEIR TECHNICIANS ARE ONLY COMPUTER-READERS, YET THEY WERE AWARE THAT THE PROBLEM EXISTED BY THE DISCLOSURE THAT THEY HAD SERVICED 5 PREVIOUS F-250 TRUCKS WITH THE EXACT PROBLEM WITH THE ELECTRIC ACCELERATOR-PEDAL WITHIN THE LAST FEW MONTHS.   THE TRUCK OWNER PAID THE $ 162.89 TO THE JONES-WEST FORD DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THE NEWER VERSION OF THE GAS PEDAL INSTALLED AFTER THE JONES-WEST SERVICE MANAGER (BUD) REFUSED TO HONOR THE FORD WARRANTY FOR THE 11,700 MILE-OLD VEHICLE.
