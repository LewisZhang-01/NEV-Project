        "summary": "About a month ago I got into my vehicle and noticed a corner of my infotainment screen was cracked.  The cracking is internal and seems to spider around the corner.  It cannot be felt externally in any way.  Doing some research, I came across multiple other owners displaying similar problems.  I was also able to find Service Alert No. SA-008/18 which pertained to the same issue even labeling it as (spider cracking).    Calling Mazda's customer experience department, I was informed (and knew) that a service alert is not a recall.  While this is true it is something that occurs due to normal temperature changes in a product (vehicle) that should be able to withstand such conditions.  I was also informed that the Service Alert did not include my VIN even though my vehicle is inside the year, make, and model the service alert pertains to.  I was encouraged to reach out to NHTSA if I had further concerns.  While the spider cracking was more of an aesthetic issue since then I have noticed the infotainment will often rapidly change through various menus and apps.  This causes both a sudden distraction to the driver as well as potentially making unknown changes to the vehicle systems maintained through the infotainment package.  While my wife was driving the vehicle last week and trying to use the navigation, she was consistently having the directions break up and display change causing her to need to pull over.  Given that both the aesthetic cracking and the menu/apps changing problems began at the same time it seems that the internal crack may have thrown off some pressure/contact the display relies on.  The vehicle is available for inspections upon request.  Aesthetic problem was seen by the dealer on July 7, 2021 however the function changes were not observed until just after.",

HE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THERE WAS A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN POSTED BY MAZDA THAT DESCRIBED THE EXACT ISSUE, AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S SURE IT IS. I GOT A SECOND OPINION FROM ANOTHER MECHANIC AND HE EXPLAINED THE SAME THING. THE COST TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION WITH A REMANUFACTURED MODEL IS SOMEWHERE IN THE BALLPARK OF $2,000 - $3,500. THE SECOND MECHANIC I WENT TO SHOWED ME THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN. AFTER THE DESCRIPTION, THE BULLETIN STATES, \"THIS IS CAUSED BY A DAMAGED BEARING IN THE TRANSAXLE DUE TO IMPROPER CONFIGURATION OF THE TRANSAXLE CASE.\" THIS WOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY; UNFORTUNATELY, THE ISSUE IS KNOWN ONLY TO HAPPEN RIGHT AROUND 65,000 + MILES, AFTER THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED.

THE TRANSAXLE FAILED AT 70,000 MILES, 10,000 MILES OVER THE 60,000 MILE WARRANTY, BUT IT WAS WELL WITHIN THE 5 YEAR WARRANTY PERIOD. WE DISCUSSED THE ISSUE WITH AT LEAST A DOZEN LOCAL TRANSMISSION REPAIR SHOPS FOR ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE.

HE SAID HE TOLD THE POLICE THAT HE WAS WATCHING ME TURN MY CAR INTO THE TURNAROUND AREA AND SAW THE CAR SUDDENLY ACCELERATE. HE WANTED ME TO KNOW THAT THERE WAS A MECHANICAL PROBLEM WITH MY CAR.  HE TOLD ME THAT WHEN HE APPROACHED THE CAR, IT WAS REVVING AND STILL TRYING TO ACCELERATE INTO THE TRUCK, EVEN THOUGH MY FEET WERE NOWHERE NEAR THE PEDALS.

I TURNED THE CAR OFF WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ENGAGED AT OVER 3/4 OF THE WAY UP. I WAS STANDING ABOUT 10 FEET OUTSIDE MY CAR, WHICH WAS OFF AND STATIONARY, TALKING TO A FRIEND FOR APPROXIMATELY 10-15 MINUTES WHEN MY CAR STARTED TO ROLL BACKWARDS OF ITS OWN ACCORD. I ATTEMPTED TO PUSH IT, WHICH FAILED, AND THEN I JUMPED INTO THE DRIVERS SEAT AND TRIED TO PULL THE EMERGENCY BRAKE UP AS FAR AS IT COULD GO, WHICH DID NOT STOP THE CAR. IT THEN CRASHED INTO THE BUMPER OF ANOTHER CAR. BECAUSE THE WHEEL HAD BEEN TURNED TO THE LEFT WHEN I PARKED, THE CAR HAD ROLLED AT AN ANGLE SO THAT ONLY THE RIGHT SIDE BUMPER MADE CONTACT WITH THE OTHER CAR?S BIG ALUMINUM BUMPER THAT STICKS OUT. AFTER DRIVING THE CAR OUT FROM AGAINST THE BUMPER, I FOUND THERE TO BE COSMETIC DAMAGE THAT INCLUDED THE BUMPER STICKING OUT. (ESTIMATE $855)  MAY 16, 2014 AT 9:00 AM. AFTER APPROXIMATELY AN HOUR AND A HALF I WAS TOLD THAT THE TECHNICIANS FOUND THAT THE EMERGENCY BRAKE APPLIED WHEN THE HANDLE WAS APPLIED ALL THE WAY UP, WHICH THEY TERMED ?WITHIN NORMAL OPERATION.\" HOWEVER, FOR ?PEACE OF MIND,? THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY TIGHTENED THE BRAKE SO THAT NOW IT ONLY GOES UP 5 CLICKS. THE ACTUAL WORDING USED IS ?TECH MADE MINOR ADJUSTMENT SO EBRAKE DOES NOT GO ALL THE WAY UP.?   ON MAY 21, 2014, AT APPROXIMATELY 7:05 PM, I STARTED MY CAR AND A FLASHING LIGHT ON MY DASHBOARD APPEARED. THIS IS THE ?BSM OFF? LIGHT, IN REGARDS TO THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING. I READ THE MANUAL AND IT SAID TO CLEAN THE AREA WHERE THE BSM SENSORS ARE, WHICH I DID. IT STILL WAS MALFUNCTIONING SO I DID THE NEXT STEP IN THE MANUAL, WHICH WAS TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE DEALER. ESTIMATE $250  ON JUNE 2 THE PROBLEM HAPPENED AGAIN. THE PARKING BRAKE GOES ALL THE WAY UP. WE ARE TAKING IT BACK TO THE DEALER AGAIN TO HAVE IT FIXED.   *TR",
