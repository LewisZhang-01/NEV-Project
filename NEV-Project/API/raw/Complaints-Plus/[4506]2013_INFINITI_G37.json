SHE TRIED TO RESTART IT WITHOUT ANY SUCCESS AND TURN ON HER HAZARD LIGHTS, BUT THE ENTIRE ELECTRIC SYSTEM HAD SHUT DOWN FOR NO APPARENT REASON. SHE WAS VERY SCARED BECAUSE CARS WERE HONKING AT HER AND AFTER FLAGGING DOWN A POLICE OFFICER (30 MINUTES LATER),  THE CAR MYSTERIOUSLY TURNED BACK ON. WHEN SHE TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP, THEY DID A QUICK COMPUTER CHECK AND TOLD HER NOTHING WAS WRONG. AND THEY SAID THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING EVEN THOUGH MY MOTHER TOLD THEM THAT SHE FOUND SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET RECOUNTING THIS SAME PROBLEM WITH THIS PARTICULAR MODEL OF INFINITI. WE ALSO REPORTED THIS TO THE INFINITI CUSTOMER AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD LOOK INTO IT.  *TR",
