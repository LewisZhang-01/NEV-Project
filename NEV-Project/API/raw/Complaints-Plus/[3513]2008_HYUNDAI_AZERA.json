DEALER REPLACED THROTTLE SENSOR AND PERFORMED ECM UPDATE AS A RESULT OF THIS VISIT.  PREVIOUSLY HAD SAME VEHICLE (3 WEEKS PRIOR - 25,187 MILES) AT ANOTHER DEALER FOR SIMILAR COMPLAINT WITH SURGING PROBLEM.  NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT PRESENT.  IT TOOK THEM 2 DAYS TO DIAGNOSE PROBLEM, THEN HAD TO WAIT FOR PART AND THEN INSTALL - TOTAL TIME AT DEALER (INCLUDING OVER WEEKEND) 5 DAYS.  DROVE CAR INTO DEALER FOR FIRST REPAIR, NO TOW NEEDED.  INITIAL DEALER CALLED TECH SUPPORT TO HELP DIAGNOSE AND INITIATED A CASE NUMBER WITH THEM.  REPLACED MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR DURING THAT VISIT.  SAME SYMPTOMS AT FIRST INCIDENT INCLUDING VEHICLE 'SURGING' AT HIGH RATES OF SPEED (50 MPH+).  LUCKY THERE WASN'T A MAJOR INJURY OR FATALITY WITH THE TYPE OF SPEED DROP IN THE SECOND INCIDENT.  I HAD JUST EXITED THE BUSY INTERSTATE ABOUT 5 MILES EARLIER FOR A 2-LANE LOCAL HIGHWAY.

AFTER SECOND INCIDENT, I CALLED HYUNDAI AMERICA TO REPORT INCIDENT AND LODGE COMPLAINT.  THEY ARE 'INVESTIGATING'.  VERY CONCERNING THAT THIS INVOLVES A THROTTLE PROBLEM AND POTENTIAL ELECTRICAL SYSTEM FAILURE AT HIGH RATES OF SPEED WITH NO NOTICE.  THIS DEFECT COULD EASILY CAUSE A POTENTIAL SERIOUS INJURY OR FATALITY.  VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS HYUNDAI WHICH WE BOUGHT FOR RELIABILITY AND SAFETY. *TR",
