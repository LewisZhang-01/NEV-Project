However, no warning light came on and I was not going to fast for the weather or road conditions.  I did not hit any pot holes or anything else to cause the part to fail.  When I went to apply my brakes the brakes felt soft and spongy and I was concern with the car not stopping.  Safety issues for me and others were if my car didn't stop and me hitting another vehicle and injuring/killing them or myself due to the component failure.  I was able to get my car to Acura Sterling McCall in Houston and they were able to duplicate the issue and I was advised the VSA needed to be replaced.  That this was causing the soft brakes.",
