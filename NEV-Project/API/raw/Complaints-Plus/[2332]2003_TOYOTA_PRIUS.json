THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION WHEN THE SHAKING OCCURRED AND IT WAS OFTEN AFTER MAKING A TURN AND/OR STRAIGHTENING THE STEERING WHEEL.  IN ORDER TO STOP THE SHAKING, THE CAR HAS TO BE STOPPED.

IT WAS MOSTLY AN ANNOYANCE AT FIRST, AND WOULD HAPPEN WHEN STARTING THE CAR, BUT TWICE IT HAS NEARLY CAUSED A CRASH.      THE FIRST NEAR COLLISION FROM SHAKING WAS IN JANUARY WHEN TRYING TO PARK BETWEEN TWO CARS IN A PARKING SPOT AND I COULDN'T CONTROL THE WHEEL UNTIL I PUT THREW THE CAR INTO PARK, TURNED IT OFF, AND TURNED IT ON AGAIN.      THE SECOND, AND MOST SERIOUS INCIDENT SO FAR I NEARLY HIT A PEDESTRIAN IN A CROSSWALK WHILE TRYING TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN IN DOWNTOWN SEATTLE ON A DAY WHEN IT WAS IN THE 20'S.  TURNING RIGHT THE STEERING WHEEL STARTED SHAKING SO VIOLENTLY IT BROKE FREE FROM MY GRIP, I LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR AND IT VEERED LEFT INTO THE ONCOMING LANE TOWARDS A PEDESTRIAN.  I SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES AND ONLY MISSED HIM BY ABOUT 3 FEET.      I CONTACTED TOYOTA AND WAS INFORMED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A 2 YEAR SERVICE CAMPAIGN TO REPLACE THE EPS, BUT THAT THE CAMPAIGN EXPIRED 12/31/13, AND THEY WERE THEREFORE UNABLE TO DO A REPLACEMENT BECAUSE I DIDN'T BRING THE CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP BEFORE THE DEADLINE, AND THEY DON'T SEE IT AS A SAFETY ISSUE.  WE WERE NEVER CONTACTED BY TOYOTA ABOUT THE SERVICE CAMPAIGN, AND THE ISSUE DID NOT BECOME DANGEROUS OR EVEN PARTICULARLY BOTHERSOME UNTIL NEARLY A MONTH AFTER THE CAMPAIGN EXPIRED.  DUE TO THIS NEARLY CAUSING TWO ACCIDENTS IN A SHORT TIME SPAN JUST PAST THE CAMPAIGN DEADLINE, AND THE FACT THAT IT SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM ON THIS MODEL OF PRIUS, I BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE ESCALATED TO A GENERAL RECALL OR EXTENDED WARRANTY BASED ALSO ON MILEAGE INSTEAD OF SOLELY ON THE CALENDAR YEAR TO NOT PENALIZE LOWER MILEAGE VEHICLES COMING INTO THE PROBLEM BEYOND THE EXPIRATION OF THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT MANDATED SERVICE CAMPAIGN.  *TR",

MECHANICS NOT AFFILIATED WITH TOYOTA HAVE TOLD ME THIS IS A COMMON, WELL KNOWN ISSUE WITH THE 2003 TOYOTA PRIUS.

ON 12/27/2008, I STARTED THE CAR AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT APPEARED AGAIN.  I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE TOYOTA DEALER.  THE DEALERSHIP DISCOVERED OIL IN THE INTAKE MANIFOLD AS PER A TSB.  THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT CHARGE ME FOR PART OF THE REPAIRS.        ON 01/04/2008, I WAS DRIVING WHEN AN INTERMITTENT GRINDING NOISE BEGAN ON BOTH BRAKING AND ACCELERATION.  I FOUND THAT THE NOISE DISAPPEARED IF I BRAKED AND ACCELERATED EXTREMELY GENTLY.  I IMMEDIATELY DROVE TO THE DEALERSHIP.  WHEN I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP, I WAS TOLD THAT THE PROBLEM COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS A SHIM IN THE BRAKING SYSTEM THAT MAY HAVE SLIPPED OUT OF POSITION.  I AUTHORIZED AN ESTIMATE OF $52.52.  THE FOLLOWING DAY, A SERVICE PERSON OF THE DEALERSHIP CALLED AND TOLD ME THAT THE BRAKES WERE FINE BUT THAT THE PROBLEM COULD BE RESOLVED BY CHANGING THE SPARKPLUGS.  I ORALLY AUTHORIZED AN ESTIMATE OF ABOUT $150.00 (I DON?T REMEMBER THE EXACT AMOUNT.).  THE SERVICE REP CALLED ME LATER THAT DAY (1/5) AND EXPLAINED THAT MY PROBLEM WASN'T?T REALLY THE SPARKPLUGS BUT THAT THE CAR'S TRANSMISSION NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  THE ESTIMATE FOR THE PARTS AND LABOR FOR THIS REPAIR WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $2,000.  THE SERVICE REP INFORMED ME ON 1/6/2008 THAT A MISTAKE WAS MADE AND COST OF THE NEW TRANSMISSION ALONE WOULD BE $5,000, WITH OTHER PARTS, LABOR, AND THE COST OF A RENTAL CAR, THE FINAL ESTIMATE FOR REPAIR WAS AROUND $7,000.  *CN",

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u001cWE ARE WORKING ON IT AND YOUR DEALER WILL NOTIFY YOU.\u001d   I\u0019VE SINCE HEARD FROM MY DEALER STAFF THAT THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF LEXUS GX470'S AS WELL AS 4-RUNNERS INVOLVED. I\u0019M BEGINNING TO FEEL THAT THEY HAVE SO MANY VEHICLES WITH DIFFERENTIAL ASSEMBLIES INVOLVED, THAT IT MAY REQUIRE SOME KIND OF MAJOR REDESIGN AND BUILD. IT MIGHT BE A LONG TIME BEFORE WE SEE A FIX!   I HAUL A POP-UP TRAILER AND DOES IT MAGNIFY THE PROBLEM!*AK",

I TOLD THEM I WOULD TAKE THE CAR AS IS, BUT WOULD HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT MAY HAPPEN IF THE TIRES FAILED.  WHEN I WENT TO GET THE CAR THEY WERE MOUNTING NEW TIRES AT THEIR EXPENSE.
