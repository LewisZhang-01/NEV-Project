Due to being 100% disabled since 2009, Air bag & safety belt system light comes on when i have onstar diagnose the problem they said it has something to do with my seat belt system on passenger side which mind you isnt used often at all and cadilac will not help with the cost and was told by onstar it needs repairs asap because it could cause air bags to pop out while driving or not come out during a crash. Im afraid some times driving it. In the 7yrs of owning this i maybe put around 40,000 miles on the car its in good condition. Which lead me to the other problem due to miles. When i purchased the cadilac a few days later the check engine light came on it was the catalytic converter it was almost $800 it has two of them the dealer repaired it. Here the other day i had onstar do a complete system scan and the report showed the converter was in the process of going out again but just hasnt triggered my check engine lite. I was shocked because of the miles i drivewhich is under 6000 miles a yr and i use top grade fuel there isnt any way these converters should be going out they should have lasted for the rest of my life and the cars life i take very good care of it changing the oils on a regular bases and other cares are met but when talk to cadilac they didnt even consider my care and miles driven at all or find out why tne converter is needed twice since i owned the car when most cars never need converter replacement. Im 62 yrs old, these are concerns i have but mostly the treatment by cadilac (GM) the safety part being on passenger side that seat never hardly get used but could cause air bags to open while driving and two convertersin 6-7 years of ownership when most cars never need one and othhers just once. Which tells me theres a problem some where else causing it to not work properly, but it didnt matter.",

THE MECHANIC (WORKS FOR DEALERSHIP) SAID TO US THAT ANECDOTALLY HE HAS RUN INTO THIS PROBLEM MORE THAN ONCE AND THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE A FAILURE IN THE DESIGN /WORKMANSHIP IN SOME OF THE WIRING HARNESSES CONNECTING THE EBCM TO THE SPEED SENSORS THAT CAUSES THE BRAKES TO FAIL. SEPARATELY, HE RECOMMENDED THE NEXT TIME WE BUY A CAR, WE NOT BUY A CADILLAC, BECAUSE HE FELT THAT THE FIX -- REROUTING THE HARNESS -- WAS NOT A TIME OR MONEY INTENSIVE FIX, BUT THAT GM DIDN'T SEEM INTERESTED IN LETTING CAR OWNERS KNOW THAT, DESPITE THE POTENTIAL AND OBVIOUS DANGERS.

I WAS TRAVELING 70 MPH DOWN THE HIGHWAY WHEN THE TIMING CHAIN WENT OUT AND ALMOST HAD AN ACCIDENT TRYING TO PULL ONTO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. I CONTACTED GM AND WAS TOLD THAT EVEN THOUGH MY VEHICLE HAS THE SAME ENGINE AS THE 2007 MODEL, IT WAS NOT COVERED BY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.     UPON RESEARCHING THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THE CADILLAC CTS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF ITS APPEARANCE IN 2003.  THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FROM 2003 TO 2006 FOR THE TIMING CHAIN ON THE NHTFS WEBSITE WAS THE SAME AS THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS IN THE YEARS COVERED BY GM'S SPECIAL EXTENDED WARRANTY (GM SUBJECT 10287 CONCERNING TIMING CHAIN ISSUE) FOR THE 2007-2009 CTS.     GM REALIZED THE TIMING BELTS WERE AN ISSUE AND FOUND A WAY TO ONLY COVER THOSE 3 YEARS BY BLAMING THE NEED TO REPROGRAM ENGINE CONTROL MODULE. BY DOING THIS THEY MANAGED TO PREVENT INVESTIGATIONS BY THE NHTFS REGARDING THE TIMING CHAIN ISSUE. WHILE THE ENGINE CONTROL MODULE MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE TIMING CHAIN ISSUE IN THE 2007 ' 2009 YEARS, IT IS NOT THE CAUSE OF THE ISSUE SINCE THE PROBLEM EXISTED IN THE 4 YEARS PRIOR TO THE ADDITION OF THE FAULTY ENGINE CONTROL MODULE.    THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE EXTENDED WARRANTY THERE HAVE BEEN ZERO COMPLAINTS RELATED TO TIMING CHAIN ISSUES. THIS INDICATES THAT PERHAPS THE TIMING CHAINS BEING USED PREVIOUSLY WERE LIKELY REPLACED, BUT I DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO INVESTIGATE THAT.     THE NHTFS HAS NEVER INVESTIGATED THE TIMING CHAIN PROBLEM IN THE 7 YEARS IT WAS OCCURRING. PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT MOST PEOPLE FILING A COMPLAINT ABOUT A TIMING CHAIN DON'T KNOW HOW TO CATEGORIZE IT (I FOUND INSTANCES UNDER AIRBAGS, ELECTRICAL, ETC.) THESE ARE ONLY THE CASES THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO THE NHTFS, BUT THE INTERNET IS FILLED WITH PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PROBLEM.   *TR",

I HAD THE VEHICLE LOOKED AT BY MECHANICS AT THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY WERE UNABLE TO REPLICATE, BUT WOULD GUESS MANIFOLD GASKET, THAT?S A LOT OF MONEY FOR A GUESS FIX THAT MAY NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. THE ISSUE HAS HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES SINCE; YESTERDAY IT HAPPENED WHILE IN REVERSE (TURNING WHEEL TO THE LEFT UNDER 5 MPH) I THOUGHT I WASN'T GOING TO EVER STOP!  HTTP://FORUMS.EDMUNDS.COM/DISCUSSION/COMMENT/4050860  LIST A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING THE SAME ISSUE HAPPENED TO THEM AND THE DEALERSHIP MECHANICS HAVE GUESSED FIXES FROM WHEEL HUBS TO LOOSE RADIATOR HOSES, BUT THE PROBLEM CONTINUES AFTER THE GUESS FIX.  UNTIL SOMEONE GETS DEATHLY INJURED BEHIND THIS ISSUE, I DON'T THINK CADILLAC IS TAKING IT SERIOUSLY. THE OTHER COMMON PROBLEMS TRACTION ENGAGING (LIGHT COMES ON) WHEN MAKING TURNS AT HIGHER SPEEDS (OVER 5MPH) MAY BE RELATED TO THIS ISSUE.  THIS HAS HAPPENED WITH ME AND MY FAMILY IN THE VEHICLE, EVERYONE IS AWARE OF THE ISSUE, THE DEALERSHIP (WHICH APPEARS CLUELESS AS MANY OTHERS DO) AS WELL AS A LOCAL REPUTABLE FAMILY OWNED AUTO MECHANIC BUSINESS IN MY COMMUNITY.

NO DRIPS ON THE GROUND. AFTER RESEARCHING I DISCOVERED THEIR SPEC IS TO BURN 1 QUART PER 1000 MILES (1 QUART PER 500 MILES IF AGGRESSIVELY DRIVEN). I TOOK THE CAR IN FOR AN EVALUATION TO SEE IF IT HIT THEIR \"SPECS\", AND THE SERVICE MANAGER PERFORMED AN OIL CHANGE, AND SET ME UP FOR A REINSPECTION AT 2,000 MILES. WHEN I WENT IN HE CHECKED THE OIL LEVEL, AND IT WAS LOW, I ASKED WHERE THE LEVEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE DIPSTICK AND HE GAVE ME A RANGE. IF THE CONSUMPTION RATE IS SO SPECIFIC, SHOULDN'T THE TEST FOR CONSUMPTION HAVE STRICT GUIDLELINES ABOUT WHERE THE DIPSTICK READINGS SHOULD BE?     I HAVE OWNED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY GM VEHICLES FOR MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE. EVEN IN THE ONES I'VE KEPT FOR 150,000 MILES PLUS, I HAVE NEVER HAD EVEN ONE OF THEM LEAK LET ALONE BURN OIL AT THIS RATE. IN 3000 MILES, I HAVE TO PUT 2 QUARTS OF OIL IN THIS VEHICLE, AND THAT'S NORMAL.    IT MAY NOT BE A SAFETY ISSUE, AT LEAST UNTIL MY CAR ENGINE SEIZES ON THE HIGHWAY FROM LACK OF OIL, BUT IT IS DEF SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY GM. *TR",

BRAKE PADS MANUFACTURED TODAY CONTAIN NO ASBESTOS. MOST VEHICLES MANUFACTURED IN PAST YEARS USED A LINING CONTAINING ASBESTOS. THERE ARE MANY FACTORS BEHIND THE CHANGE IN THE DESIGN OF TODAY'S BRAKING SYSTEMS; FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES, SERVICE LIFE, NOISE LEVEL, STOPPING ABILITY, FADE RESISTANCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS.    THEREFORE, AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURERS HAVE MOVED INTO A NEW ERA IN BRAKE PAD COMPOSITION, BALANCING LONG LASTING METALLIC MATERIALS WITH SOFTER MATERIALS, WHICH OFFSET BRAKE \"SQUEAL\" INHERENT IN A MORE METALLIC PAD. THIS NEW MATERIAL IS MUCH SAFER TO THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE OF THE ELIMINATION OF ASBESTOS, BUT A TRADE OFF MIGHT BE SHORTER PAD LIFE, DEPENDING ON BRAKING USAGE AND CONDITIONS.    BRAKE PAD AND LINING REPLACEMENT IS NOT COVERED BY THE MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY, AND IS CONSIDERED A MAINTENANCE ITEM.
