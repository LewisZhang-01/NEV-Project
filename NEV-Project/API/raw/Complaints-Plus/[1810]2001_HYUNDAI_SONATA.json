A DRIVER OF A GREEN SEDAN CAR WAS BEHIND ME AND I WAS TRYING TO WAVE HER AROUND ME BUT SHE STOPPED AND ASSISTED ME INTO GETTING MY CAR OFF THE STREET BY PUSHING MY CAR WHILE IT WAS IN NEUTRAL. I AM ONLY TELLING YOU THIS BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY CAR BEFORE THIS INCIDENT. I WAS TOLD BY HYUNDAI THOMPSON THAT MY CAR WOULD NOT START AFTER IT WAS TOWED THERE. I WENT THERE THE NEXT DAY AND THE CAR DID START BUT IT WOULD NOT GO INTO GEAR WHICH WAS A SURPRISE TO ME. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY MAY HAVE TO CHECK THE TRANSMISSION AND TALK TO YOU TO SEE IF THAT DAMAGE WOULD BE COVER UNDER THE RECALL FOR REPLACING THE ENGINE CRADLE. AFTER HYUNDAI THOMPSON REPAIRED MY CAR I HAD TO TAKE IT BACK FOR A ROARING NOISE CAUSED BY THE WHEEL BEARING IN THE WHEEL THAT JAMMED AGAINST THE WHEEL WELL WHEN THE AXLE SNAPPED OFF THE SUBFRAME. THEY ALSO COULD NOT PREFORM A WHEEL ALIGNMENT.  I ALSO TOOK IT FOR A SAFETY INSPECTION AND IT FAILED DUE TO SOME ITEMS I FEEL ARE RELATED TO THE REPAIR OF REPLACING THE SUBFRAME LIKE THE WHEEL BEARING, THE FRONT END ALIGNMENT, BOTH FRONT UPPER CONTROL ARMS AND THE OUTER TIE RODS MISSING COTTER KEYS.

I WAS LOOKING TO GET A THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR REPLACED. DURING THEIR DIAGNOSTICS, WITH THE CAR ON A LIFT, THEY NOTICED TWO THINGS. ONE, A POWER STEERING LEAK WAS OCCURRING MOST LIKELY BECAUSE OF A CORRODED POWER STEERING LINE NEAR THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE SUBFRAME. TWO, IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF THE SUSPECTED HOSE FAILURE, THE SUBFRAME HAD RUSTED THROUGH ON TWO SIDES OF THE PIECE.

TOWARD THE BOTTOM OF THE GRADE THE ROAD CURVES TO THE RIGHT AND AT THE BOTTOM THERE IS A TRAFFIC SIGNAL.  WHEN I CAME AROUND THE CURVE I SAW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GREEN AND PROCEEDED TO ACCELERATE IN ORDER TO GET UP THE APPROACHING UPGRADE.  WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO ACCELERATE THE ENGINE REVVED VERY HIGH BUT THE VEHICLE CONTINUED TO SLOW DOWN.   TANSMISSION HAD SHIFTED INTO NEUTRAL ALTHOUGH THE SHIFTER STILL INDICATED THAT I WAS IN DRIVE.  THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT AUTOMATICALLY SHIFT OUT OF NEUTRAL.  I HAD TO MANUALLY SHIFT INTO LOW GEAR.  TWO DAYS LATER I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER AND, AFTER THREE DAYS, I WAS TOLD THAT THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG AND THAT THEY WOULD MAKE NO REPAIRS.  ON FRIDAY MAY 4, 2001 I WAS CONTACTED BY THE HYUNDAI REGIONAL SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE WHO TRIED TO CONVINCE ME THAT THERE IS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH MY VEHICLE.  HE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS THE VEHICLES \"ADAPTIVE LEARNING\" FEATURE THAT CAUSED THE SHIFT AND THAT WHAT I EXPERIENCED WAS PERFECTLY NORMAL.  I FIND IT VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THE NEW CAR I OWN WAS DESIGNED TO SHIFT AND STAY IN NEUTRAL WHEN IT IS IN A SITUATION WHERE ACCELERATION IS NECESSARY.  BOTH THE DEALER AND THE MANUFACTUER CONTINUE TO INSIST THAT THERE IS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH THE VEHICLE AND REFUSE TO MAKE ANY REPAIRS.  ALSO, ONE WEEK BEFORE THE INCIDENT , MY WIFE AND I WERE ON THE SAME ROAD  AND THE VEHICLE DID NEARLY THE SAME THING.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS THAT AFTER ABOUT A SECOND OR TWO OF STEPPING ON THE GAS PEDAL TRANSMISSION SHIFTED ITSELF BACK FROM NEUTRAL INTO DRIVE.  PLEASE HELP.*AK",
