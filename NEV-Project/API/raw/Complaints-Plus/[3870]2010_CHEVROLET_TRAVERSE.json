IT WAS WELL MAINTAINED WITH ROUTINE OIL CHANGES, RECENTLY WITH SYNTHETIC OIL DUE TO THE HIGH MILEAGE. I CHANGED THE SPARK PLUGS AND AIR FILTER, WHICH HELPED FOR A SHORT TIME. IT BEGAN REVVING AT HIGH RPMS ON THE FREEWAY AND NOT SHIFTING. AFTER APRX FIVE MONTHS OF EXPERIENCING THE SYMPTOMS PERIODICALLY, THE ENGINE LIGHT FINALLY CAME ON AND ALERTED THERE WAS A PROBLEM JUST OVER 108,000 MILES. THE CODE P0008 INDICATED A TIMING ISSUE, RESULTING FROM EITHER A STRETCHED TIMING CHAIN OR BAD TENSIONER. THE LIGHT WAS OFF THE NEXT MORNING, BUT RETURNED LATER THE SAME DAY. I DID NOT DRIVE THE TRAVERSE FOR APRX TWO WEEKS IN FEAR OF THE TIMING CHAIN BREAKING. THE DAY I WAS TAKING IT TO THE DEALER, I ATTEMPTED TO START IT AND BLEW THE ENGINE. THE CHEVY MECHANIC CONFIRMED IT WAS A RESULT OF THE TIMING CHAIN. DOING RESEARCH, THERE ARE SEVERAL CASES OF THE 3.6L ENGINE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE PREMATURE FAILURE OF THE TIMING CHAIN STRETCHING. I AM JUST THANKFUL I WAS NOT DRIVING AT THE TIME IT BROKE. I WANT TO KNOW WHY IT TOOK SO LONG FOR THE ENGINE LIGHT TO COME ON AFTER EXPERIENCING THE SIGNS FOR MONTHS.

I DID SOME RESEARCH, WHICH WAS CONFIRMED BY BUFFOMATIC, THAT THIS WAVE PLATE PROBLEM IS COMMON IN GM TRANSMISSIONS AND A RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED ON OTHER GM MODELS BUT NOT THE TRAVERSE.  I SENT REQUESTS TO BOTH THE DEALER AND GM DIRECTLY THAT THIS RECALL BE EXTENDED TO MY TRAVERSE.  BOTH DENIED MY REQUEST.  I AM THEREFORE APPEALING TO NHTSA THAT GM BE REQUIRED TO HONOR THE WAVE PLATE RECALL AND REFUND ME THE $4860.00 I PAID FOR THE TRANSMISSION REPAIRS.  THANK YOU.",

GM RECALL, BULLETIN # 14515B. I SPOKE TO SEVERAL GM DEALERS IN TOWN WHO GAVE ME THE RUN AROUND ABOUT HOW THIS WAS NOT A SAFETY RECALL BECAUSE OF FAULTY PARTS BUT AN \"INFORMATIONAL BULLETIN\". LONG STORY SHORT I HAD TO PAY 300 DOLLARS TO GET A NEW MODULE PROGRAMMED. THE DAMAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE IF I WOULD HAVE LET THEM RUN MORE DIAGNOSTICS PRIOR TO FIXING THE ISSUE. I COMPLAINED TO GM WHO SAID THERE WAS NO RECALL ON MY VEHICLE AND REFERRED ME TO NHTSA.     FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE MODULE CAN BECOME CONTAMINATED BECAUSE OF WET CONDITIONS. ON JUNE 12, 2017 CHEYENNE WY HAD A VERY LARGE HAIL STORM THAT MY VEHICLE WAS CAUGHT IN WHILE DRIVING IN THE CITY AND THE MODULE MAY HAVE GOTTEN WET CAUSING THE PROBLEM.     MY COMPLAINT IS THAT GM RECALLED THIS SAME PART ON ALL THESE OTHER VEHICLES TO INCLUDE 2010 TRAVERSES BUT FOR WHAT EVER REASON MY VIN NUMBER IS NOT INCLUDED. I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE MY VEHICLE HAD THE EXACT SAME ISSUE AS TO WHY THEY RECALLED ALL THESE OTHERS. I STILL HAVE THE FAULTY MODULE IF ANYONE WANTS TO CHECK IT OUT BECAUSE IT IS THE SAME PART AND PART NUMBER WHICH WAS RECALLED.

GM HAS NOTIFIED ME OF THIS ISSUE IMPACTING CARS OF THE SAME YEAR, MAKE AND MODEL.  HOWEVER, THE VEHICLE ON BOARD COMPUTER (OBC) CLEARS AFTER THE 3RD RESTART (ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP) AND PROOF OF THE ERROR VIA THE OBC IS WIPED OUT (ONLY LEAVING ME WITH VIDEO AND PICTURES, WHICH GMC WILL NOT HONOR IN ITS REPAIR PROTOCOL).    AS STATED, THIS REOCCURRING ISSUE IS BEING EXPERIENCED AT HIGH SPEEDS ON BUSY HIGHWAYS AND THE CAR WILL QUICKLY THROTTLE DOWN TO SPEEDS OF 30-40 MPH -- WHICH IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION IN A HIGHWAY ENVIRONMENT (LIKE THE 495 BELTWAY IN WASHINGTON, DC).    I TRULY FEAR FOR MY SAFETY IN DRIVING THIS VEHICLE AND GMC IS COMPLACENT IN HAVING ME PROVE THROUGH THE OBC THAT THIS IS HAPPENING, AND THEN HAVING A DEALERSHIP RECREATE THE ISSUE.  THERE A HUNDREDS OF REFERENCES TO THIS ISSUE AS I SEARCHED THE INTERNET FOR ANSWERS LONG BEFORE GMC REACHED OUT TO ME.    GMC IS PLAYING GAMES WITH CONSUMERS AND ADVISING THAT THIS ISSUE DOWS NOT POSE TO SAFETY HAZARD.   MY EXPERIENCES IN THIS VEHICLE ARE PROOF THAT THEIR CLAIMS ARE FALSE.    PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE --- CONTACT ME --- GM'S PROTOCOL IS GETTING IN THE WAY OF ADDRESSING DANGEROUS VEHICLE ISSUES.",

THE MORE I DUG INTO THIS DIAGNOSIS, I'VE COME ACROSS NUMEROUS POSTS FROM OTHER '09-'10 OWNERS WITH THE SAME ISSUE. SOME HAD EXPERIENCED SUDDEN LOSS IN POWER WHILE TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND OTHERS HADN'T EVEN HAD A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COME ON. THERE WERE SOME OWNERS THAT HAD TO HAVE THESE ITEMS REPLACED AT AROUND 60,000MI. I HAVE REACHED OUT TO GM AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO HELP ALLEVIATE THIS COST, NOR ARE THEY IN A POSITION TO ISSUE A RECALL. THEY ALSO INFORMED ME THAT WE MISSED THE 'WARRANTY PERIOD' BY A YEAR AND A HALF AND THAT THERE ARE NO 'SPECIAL BULLETINS' RELATED TO MY VEHICLE. I ASKED IF THEY HAD AN INCREASE IN OTHER CALLS ABOUT THIS SAME ISSUE AND THEY DENIED ANY KNOWING OF THIS. MY DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT THEY ARE SEEING SUCH AN INCREASE IN THIS ISSUE THAT THEY KEEP AN INVENTORY OF PARTS ON HAND AND THEY PERFORM AT LEAST 3 TIMING CHAIN REPAIRS A WEEK. I'M FORTUNATE THAT OUR DEALERSHIP IS WORKING WITH US ON DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE COST, BUT GM IS NOT DOING ANYTHING ON THEIR END TO ACKNOWLEDGE THERE IS A POTENTIAL PROBLEM OR WILLING TO HELP OUT.",

GM MADE NO SIGNIFICANT DESIGN CHANGES TO PREVENT THIS DEFECT FROM CAUSING THE CHAIN TO GAIN SLACK AND CAUSE ENGINE ISSUES TO DEVELOP.

(CHEVY'S WAY OF MORE RECALLS WITHOUT CALLING THEM THAT) BESIDES MANY OTHER CODES, THIS WEEKS P0008 CODE IS A KNOWN TIMING CHAIN ISSUE.  SINCE WE TOOK IT IN AND IT WASN'T ONE OF THE SPECIAL ADJUSTMENTS, THEY MADE US PAY FOR THE $90 DIAGNOSTIC, WOULDN'T GIVE ME THE CAR UNTIL I PAID.  OFFERED FOR \"US\" TO PAY AND FIX THE PROBLEM AND THEY WOULD SPLIT THE COST WITH US, WENT FROM $2,700 TO $863, WHAT A DEAL! IT IS A KNOWN DEFECT! WHY SHOULD WE PAY A $1, WE ALREADY PAID FOR THE VEHICLE???  AFTER HOLDING ARE CAR HOSTAGE FOR THE $90 AND OFFERING FOR US TO PAY FOR GM'S FIX, WE HAVE DECIDED TO CHECK ALL REACALL'S AND BUY USED WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT.  I REALLY HOPE THE PEOPLE GET A DOSE OF WHAT THEY GIVE IN LIFE.  THEY HAVE THESE PEOPLE TRAINED TO SELL A LINE OF CRAP ALL THE WAY FROM PURCHASE TO END OF LIFE ON THE VEHICLE.  I KNOW THEY ARE A NECESSARY EVIL, BUT BUYERS BEWARE, CARS ARE THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY, STRESS, AND TIME.  THEY DON'T PAY FOR ALL YOUR TIME FOR THE RECALLS,WHY? BUY A CHEAPER USED CAR AND CHECK THE RECALLS BEFORE YOU DO.  DON'T BUY NEW, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM YET.  NO ONE LOOKS COOL IN AN COSTLY CAR WITH A TON OF ISSUES.  LIFE'S TO SHORT.  I WOULD SAY DON'T GO TO CHEVY BUT THEY ARE ALL SIMILAR TO A POINT.  GOOD LUCK, MY TRAVERSE IS BEING SOLD THIS WEEK.  SORRY TO WHOEVER BUYS IT FROM CARMAX.  ALWAYS RESEARCH!!!!! ALWAYS BUY AT LEAST A YEAR OLD, GIVES TIME TO FIND ISSUES, 2 IS BETTER.",

ON AUGUST 6TH 2015, WHILE DRIVING MY CAR 55MPH, THE ENGINE SEIZED CAUSING LOSS OF POWER STEERING AND POWER BREAKS.  AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, THIS PUT MY FAMILY IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION.     OUR LICENSED MECHANIC TOLD US THE REASON THE ENGINE SEIZED IS A 'SPUN ROD BARRING.'  WE WERE TOLD THAT A SPUN ROD BARRING IS A VERY UNCOMMON MECHANICAL ISSUE AND EXTREMELY UNCOMMON IN A CAR THAT IS ONLY 5 YEARS OLD WITH ONLY 71K MILES ON IT.    I CALLED GENERAL MOTORS WHILE THE CAR WAS BEING REPAIRED TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM. THEY WERE QUITE RUDE AND REFUSED TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE BECAUSE I DID NOT TAKE MY CAR TO A CERTIFIED GM REPAIR SHOP. THEREFORE, I DECIDED TO SEND GM A LETTER EXPLAINING THE SITUATION.  ATTACHED IS A COPY OF THE LETTER, MAINTENANCE RECORDS, AND PHOTOS OF THE SPUN ROD BARRING I SENT TO GM.  GM CUSTOMER SERVICE CALLED ME ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS AND VERBALLY TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD NOT REIMBURSE ME OR EVEN LOOK INTO THE ISSUE BECAUSE 'I DID NOT TAKE MY CAR TO A CERTIFIED GM REPAIR SHOP FOR THE REPAIR.' I ASKED CUSTOMER SERVICE MULTIPLE TIMES TO SEND ME THIS INFORMATION IN WRITING AND THEY REFUSED.  TO REFUSE STANDARD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND AVOID TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR A POORLY ENGINEERED AND MANUFACTURED ENGINE SIMPLY BECAUSE I DID NOT TAKE MY CAR TO A CERTIFIED GM REPAIR SHOP IS INEXCUSABLE.   I HOPE THAT YOU CAN ASSIST ME IN RECEIVING REIMBURSEMENT FOR REPLACING THE ENGINE IN MY CAR AND REQUIRING GM TO RECALL THE ENGINE.  IF YOU NEED ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PLEASE LET ME KNOW.

I TOOK IT IN TO SEE WHAT CODES  AND EVERYTHING POINTED TO NEEDING A COMPUTER BOARD WHICH ENDED  UP COSTING $1009.00  CHEVY DEALERSHIP SAID \"PROBABLY JUST FLUKE, HOPEFULLY WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN\"! NOT A GOOD ANSWER FOR ME BECAUSE I DRIVE AROUND AND MY HUSBAND DEPLOYED TO AFGHANISTAN I DON'T NEED ISSUES WITH MY ONLY CAR.      THIS SHOULD BE A COVERED REPAIR. I CALLED BOTH CHEVY AND GM AND HAVE TO SAY I WAS HAPPY WITH THE CUSTOMER SERVICE I RECEIVED. I WANT TO KNOW WHY GM KNOWS THIS IS A REOCCURRING ISSUE IN THE TRAVERSE AND HAVE NOT NOTIFIED OWNERS AND SENT OUT A FACTORY RECALL.

TO REMEDY THIS I WOULD HAVE TO PULL OVER AND RESTART THE CAR AND FOR A DAY OR TWO IT WOULD BE FINE. STRANGELY THE ENGINE LIGHT WENT OFF AND I HAD NO PROBLEM FOR WEEKS. I WENT TO GET A OIL CHANGE AT A NON DEALERSHIP SHOP AND AFTER THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. I WENT TO THE AUTO SUPPLY TO GET THE CODE READ AND WAS TOLD IT WAS THE CODE P0008, THE CLERK LOOKED IT UP TO FIND IT IS A COMMON TIMING CHAIN PROBLEM. HE TOLD ME IT WAS A SAVED CODE AND THAT THIS IS A REPEAT ISSUE. I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM OCCUR AND REPAIRED UNDER WARRANTY IN APRIL 2012. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP TO BE CHARGED $67 TO TELL ME THE DREADFUL NEWS AND BECAUSE I WAS OUT OF WARRANTY THE REPAIR WOULD BE OUT OF POCKET. LONGER STORY SHORT AS I WORKED FEVERISHLY WITH GM CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE TO GET COST ASSISTANCE THE PROBLEM BECAME WORSE. WHEN I FINALLY GET A 50/50 SPLIT THE CAR BEGAN OVER HEATING MORE QUICKLY TO THE POINT I COULD NOT DRIVE IT. WHEN I TOOK THE CARE TO BE REPAIRED COOLANT WAS LEAKING AND THE WATER PUMPED NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. IN MAY 2013 I HAD MY COOLANT TOPPED OFF FOR WHAT THE DEALERSHIP DOCUMENTED AS RECALL 13079 WATER PUMP SHAFTER SEAL LEAKS. I FOUND OUT THAT THE WATER PUMP LEAK CAN DAMAGE THE TIMING CHAIN. I THINK CHEVROLET AND GM SHOULD COVER THIS COST WHEN THEY KNEW THE WATER WOULD LEAK AND WOULD NEED REPLACING BUT NOT BEFORE IT CAUSED TIMING CHAIN RELATED DRIVING ISSUES.  *TR",

THE WHEEL THEN HAD TO BE MUSCLED IN ORDER TO TURN THE VEHICLE. SINCE THAT INSTANCE, THIS ISSUE HAS INCREASED IN FREQUENCY AND HAS BECOME A DAILY OCCURRENCE. THE ISSUE HAS BEEN OBSERVED BY ALL THREE REGULAR DRIVERS OF THE VEHICLE. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, THE VEHICLE MUST BE REVERSED TO RE-INITIATE THE TURN SO AS NOT TO HIT OTHER VEHICLES OR PEDESTRIANS. ADDITIONALLY, IT WAS INDEPENDENTLY OBSERVED BY OUR MECHANIC WHEN TAKING THE VEHICLE FOR A TEST DRIVE AFTER PERFORMING UNRELATED WORK ON THE VEHICLE.    A RELATED ISSUE OBSERVED INCLUDES A SENSATION OF PINCHING OR BINDING OF THE STEERING WHEEL WHEN INITIATING A TURN AT LOW SPEED; AFTER EXPERIENCING THIS BRIEF SENSATION THE WHEEL THEN TURNS WITHOUT ISSUE. THE DANGEROUS ASPECT OF THIS ISSUE IS THAT THE DRIVER IS NOT CERTAIN THAT THE WHEEL IS ACTUALLY GOING TO TURN. HOWEVER THE DRIVER CANNOT JUST APPLY THE BRAKES AS THAT MAY RESULT IN GETTING REAR ENDED AND AT THE SAME TIME IS APPREHENSIVE ABOUT MUSCLING THE WHEEL.

SO SOME MONTHS LATER I STARTED HAVING ISSUES WITH TURNING CORNERS AND INTO MY PARKING LOT. THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD LOCK UP AND I HAD TO USE EVERYTHING IN ME TO TURN THE WHEEL. THIS IS VERY CONCERNING AND SCARY. IT IS ALMOST A YEAR AND I HAVE HAD 2 RECALLS ON THIS VEHICLE. THE HEADLIGHT HAS BLOWN OUT. THE INTERIOR LIGHTS HAVE STOPPED WORKING AND I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THIS CHEVY TRAVERSE. I CALLED CHEVROLET CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY SAID BEFORE I TALK WITH SOMEONE I HAVE TO TAKE THE TRUCK TO A DEALER AND HAVE THEM DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM AND I HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DIAGNOSIS. THEY ALSO SAID THAT THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND THERE IS NO WARRANTY AT THIS TIME FOR THE POWER STEERING ONLY FOR THE 2 RECALLS. I THINK WE SHOULD FILE A CLASS ACTION AGAINST CHEVROLET. THIS IS RIDICULOUS THAT WE ARE ALL HAVING THE SAME ISSUES AND THERE HAS NOT BEEN A RECALL YET. LIVES ARE AT RISK WITH THESE TYPES OF PROBLEMS.  *TR",
