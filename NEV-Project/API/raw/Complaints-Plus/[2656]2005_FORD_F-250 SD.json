AFTER A FEW HOURS RESEARCH ONLINE, THIS PROBLEM IS WELL DOCUMENTED AND FREQUENT WITH THE FORD SUPER DUTY LINE FROM 05\"-08\". IT SEEMS TO BE AN ENGINEERING DEFECT AND FORD IS WELL AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, BUT IT DOES APPEAR THAT FORD HAS OFFERED ANY REMEDIES. THE NHTSA ALSO KNOWS OF THE PROBLEM.  I VIEWED FOUR NHTSA VIDEOS THAT DEMONSTRATED THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM THAT I AM EXPERIENCING WITH MY TRUCK.  I HAVE FOUND NO ACTION ON THE PART OF THE NHTSA.  THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED AND CORRECTED BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED.  *TR",

HAD MAJOR ENGINE WORK DONE, TO INCLUDE NEW HEAD GASKET, EGR COOLER, OIL/FILTER CHANGE, AND FUEL FILTERS CHANGED.  IN EARLY OCTOBER, BEGAN EXPERIENCING ISSUE WHERE TRUCK WOULD RUN VERY ROUGH FOR THE FIRST MILE OR FIRST 5 MINUTES, WHICHEVER CAME FIRST.

THEIR RECOMMENDATION: REPLACE FUEL PUMP AND FILTERS, AS WELL AS REPLACE ALL FOUR(4) INJECTORS ON THE ONE SIDE WHERE THEY IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM.  COST FOR REPAIRS, IN EXCESS OF $2100.

IT LOOKED LIKE MY PAN GASKET WAS LEAKING, REMOVED AND REPLACED MY PAN GASKET FILLED WITH OIL , STARTED TRUCK NOTHING WAS LEAKING THEN WENT TO GO HOME PUT IT IN REVERSE AND LEFT A LARGE STREAK OF OIL IN FRONT OF ME, SHUT DOWN TRUCK TRANS FLUID WAS JUST PORING OUT OF IT, LOOKED LIKE COOLER LINE WAS SPRAYING AND LEAKING, REPLACED FERAL, FILLED AGAIN, RAN TRUCK FOUND TO BE LEAKING FROM TRANS HOUSING. DID RESEARCH ONLINE FOUND THAT FORD WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THIS TRANSMISSION 04 THRU 06, PLEASE SEE ATTACHED LINKS HTTP://WWW.ABOUTAUTOMOBILE.COM/COMPLAINT/2005/FORD/F250/AUTOMATIC+TRANSMISSION ,  HTTP://WWW.ABOUTAUTOMOBILE.COM/COMPLAINT/2005/FORD/F-250+SUPERDUTY/AUTOMATIC+TRANSMISSION . AS YOU CAN SEE THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT FORD HAS ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN FOR BUT IS TELLING EVERY ONE THAT IT IS NOT A PROBLEM. I CALLED MY DEALER I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE FORM THEY TOLD ME TO CONTACT THE FACTORY AND THEY SAID I AN ON MY OWN.    AS THE SERVICE BULLETIN STATED IN THE SECOND ATTACHMENT THE TRANSMISSIONS WERE DOING THIS AT 90,000 TO 120,000 MILES, LOL AND BEHOLD MINE WENT AT 116,000. I FEEL FORD IS MORE THAN AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND  SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE AND A RECALL SHOULD BE PUT IN PLACE, THIS IS AND ONGOING PROBLEM WHICH THEY ARE DENYING. GOD FORBID THAT THIS SHOULD HAPPEN ON A HIGHWAY AND THE TRANSMISSION LOCKS UP, THEN THERE WILL BE FATALITIES INVOLVED OR MAYBE THIS HAS ALL READY HAS HAPPENED .",

I PURCHASED THE TRUCK BRAND NEW FROM THE DEALERSHIP, AND IT FIRST OCCURRED AT 19,000 MILES ON A FRONT CALIPER. FORD HAS SINCE REPLACED ALL THE CALIPERS AT LEAST ONCE UNDER THE ORIGINAL WARRANTY, BUT NOW REFUSES TO HELP. I'VE REPLACED THE REAR CALIPERS AT MY COST WITH REMANUFACTURED ONES, AND I'M STILL CONTINUING TO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. I'VE SPOKEN WITH OTHER OWNERS OF THE SAME VEHICLE WHO HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM, SO IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. I'VE BEEN RELUCTANT TO GET RID OF THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE IT'S PAID FOR IN FULL, AND BECAUSE APART FROM THE OBVIOUS BRAKE DEFECT, IT ISN'T OTHERWISE A BAD TRUCK. I STRONGLY FEEL THE CALIPER DESIGN IS FAULTY AND COULD EASILY CAUSE A PERSON TO LOOSE STEERING CONTROL IF IT OCCURS IN A FRONT CALIPER. I RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM FORD ABOUT A YEAR AGO, DESCRIBING WHAT THEY TERMED A \"HANDLING ANOMALY\" WHERE THE TRUCK SHIMMIES UNCONTROLLABLY AND FAILS TO STOP SHAKING WITHIN A FEW SECONDS LIKE A \"NORMAL SHIMMY\". WHILE FORD ATTRIBUTES THIS TO TIRES AND SUSPENSION, I BELIEVE THIS IS THE BRAKE DEFECT THAT'S CAUSING THE SHIMMY. IT'S EASY TO TELL WHICH INDIVIDUAL CALIPER IS STICKING AS IT AND OFTEN EVEN THE WHEEL WILL BE VERY HOT TO THE TOUCH WHILE THE OTHER THREE ARE COOL.

I HAD TO PULL OVER AS SOON AS I WAS ABLE TO CHECK WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE MAJOR FRONT END DAMAGE. AFTER ALL, WHAT COULD CAUSE SUCH A VIOLENT REACTION. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO BE SEEN. MY TRUCK WAS JUST SERVICED BY A FORD DEALERSHIP AS IT HAS BEEN SINCE I PURCHASED IT NEW. THIS HAS HAPPENED AT LEAST 4 TIMES TOTAL.  I CANNOT STRESS TO YOU ENOUGH HOW VIOLENT THIS \"SHIMMY\" IS.

THIS HAS HAPPENED FREQUENTLY SINCE AND HAPPENS AT LOW SPEEDS ALSO (40MPH) THE STEERING WHEEL HAS BEEN SHAKEN OFF CENTER DUE TO THIS. MY WIFE WILL NOT DRIVE THE VEHICLE AS ITS QUITE SCARY WHEN THIS HAPPENS AT RELATIVELY HIGH SPEEDS AND IS VERY SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED, I ALSO WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO RIDE IN THE VEHICLE AS I FEEL A BAD EPISODE OF THIS SHIMMY/SHUDDER COULD EASILY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. I HAVE ALSO GONE THROUGH 5 SETS OF TIRES (IN UNDER 70,000 MILES) DUE TO BEING UNABLE TO KEEP THE FRONT END ALIGNED.  I WAS QUITE UPSET AFTER THE FIRST INCIDENT AND IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT THE TRUCK TO THE NEAREST FORD DEALER TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT. THEY SAID THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING LIKE THIS AND LOOKED AT ME LIKE I WAS MAKING THIS UP. (AND I ADMIT IT SOUNDS CRAZY FOR A $40,000 TRUCK TO BEHAVE THIS WAY). THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG AND SAID I NEEDED MY FIRST SET OF NEW TIRES AND AN ALIGNMENT (AT 12,000 MILES). A FEW MONTHS LATER I CAME BACK INTO THE SAME FORD DEALER WITH THE SAME ISSUE AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOT MUCH THAT COULD BE DONE AS BASED ON MY PREVIOUS VISIT MY TRUCK APPEARED FINE. I WAS VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WALKED OUT. I AM NOW STUCK WITH A TRUCK THAT SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY SEVERAL TIMES A DAY, I AM UNABLE TO SELL THE VEHICLE AS NOBODY WOULD EVER BUY IT IN THIS CONDITION AND FEEL AS IF I HAVE BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY, AS IT APPEARS THEY HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS DEFECT AND HAVE CHOSEN TO DO NOTHING ABOUT IT FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS. THIS IS MY 5TH AND LAST FORD TRUCK.. I UNDERSTAND THAT NOTHING IS PERFECT AND THINGS CAN GO WRONG BUT MY COMPLAINTS ALONG WITH OTHERS HAVE BEEN IGNORED AND I FEEL MY TRUCK IS POSES A REAL DANGER TO ANYONE WHO RIDES IN IT. *TR",

THIS DIDN'T SEEM TO BE THE TRUTH, SINCE IT HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THEN. WHEN I BROUGHT IT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE LOCAL SERVICE MANAGER, HE SAID THAT THIS IS COMMON AMONGST THESES LARGE PICKUP TRUCKS, AND JUST TAP THE BRAKES UNTIL THE VIBRATIONS SUBSIDE, IT SHOULDN'T LAST LONG. YESTERDAY I WAS TRAVELING AT ABOUT 60 MILES AN HOUR ON THE HIGHWAY, WHEN I WENT OVER A SEWER GRATE IN THE LEFT LANE. THE VIBRATION BECAME SO VIOLENT THAT I HAD NO CONTROL OF THE STEERING AT ALL. I NARROWLY AVOIDED A COLLISION WITH A FUEL TRUCK AND SEVERAL OTHER CARS ON MY WAY OFF THE ROAD AND INTO WOODS CAUSING MULTIPLE TIRE DAMAGE, AND SUFFERING DENTS AND DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE. I THANK GOD  NO ONE WAS HURT, INCLUDING ME. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE TRUCK AWAY AFTER CHANGING THE TIRES  AND CLEANING UP THE MESS FROM MY PERSONAL PROPERTY BEING TOSSED AROUND THE CABIN. NOT ONLY DID I LOOSE STEERING BUT, I WAS SURPRISED THAT SUCH A VIOLENT EPISODE DID NOT DEPLOY THE AIR BAGS. I RETURNED TODAY TO THE DEALER WITH MY TRUCK.  THE SERVICE MANAGER HAD BEEN REPLACED,WITH A NEW ONE. WHEN I INFORMED HIM OF THE SITUATION HE CHECKED THE COMPUTER FOR MY RECORDS AND MAGICALLY HE WAS ABLE TO FIND EVERY OTHER RECORD OF SERVICE AND REPAIRS, EXCEPT THE STEERING COMPLAINTS. TOMORROW, THE 26TH, I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WHERE I HOPE TO HAVE THIS CORRECTED. ALTHOUGH THIS SERVICE MANAGER SAYS HE HASN'T HEARD OF ANY PROBLEMS WITH THESE TRUCKS.
