There are no recalls from the persistent complaints and concern about this issue.   The wearing down of the pinion seal, causing leaks, that have been repaired several times, which constantly reappears, after months to a year of being repaired at certified Cadillac dealerships. Now the GM/Cadillac dealerships are highly recommending a full differential replacement. Unfortunately, there are no differential parts nationwide to repair the issue. The GM manufactures have either discontinued the part or it's been express the parts are on back order from 3 to 6 months, or even up to a year to receive that particular part, yet there's still no recall on this issue.  This safety concern needs to be address ASAP. This can prevent power to RWD, causing an accident at driving speeds, damaging the internal drive train as well. Other motorist, as well as passengers and vehicle operator would be at great risk, if this issue is not resolved.   It's also costly and very expensive to repair. I have paid for a tremendous amount of money trying to get this reoccurring and repetitive issue resolved, without a reasonable resolution from GM or and Cadillac dealership to even offer a goodwill repair for this problem.",

On a subsequent inspection conducted on 8/24/2021, by the dealership, it was confirmed that both axle seals were leaking.  At the time of the inspection the vehicle had 120,873 miles showing on the odometer. These two reports were the initial indication that the axle seal were leaking. The dealership has maintained the vehicle since I purchased it from them. I checked to see was if there was a Service Bulletin on this issue, but there was none.  However, there was a Service Bulletin (Bulletin No. PIP5075A) concerning \"Rear Axle Leak From The Vent\" on the differential on the 2011-2013 Cadillac CTS and CTS-V.  I contend that GM over compensated for the vent leak and now the vent on the differential of the 2014 Cadillac CTS does not release the built up air pressure which is causing the seals to leak.  It is only a matter of time when the differential will lock up due to lack of lubricant and cause a serious accident.  I contacted GM on this issue, but they do not want to admit there is a problem.  However, if you look up complaints on the internet, there are many many people with this issue on Cadillac's CTS and ATS.  There needs to be at a minimum a Service Bulletin issued.

THE PLANNED TRAVEL ROUTE WAS AS FOLLOWS:  FREMONT CADILLAC, 5939 AUTOMALL PKWY, FREMONT, CA |||  NW ON BOYCE ROAD |||  N ON STEVENSON BLVD |||  INTERSTATE-880S |||  EXIT AUTOMALL PKWY |||  FREMONT CADILLAC.    I TRAVELED NORTH ON STEVENSON BLVD AND THEN HEADED FOR THE ONRAMP FOR INTERSTATE 880-SOUTH. WHEN I APPROACHED THE FREEWAY ONRAMP I NOTICED, ALL OF A SUDDEN, A DELAY BETWEEN PEDAL APPLICATION AND POWER. I DEMONSTRATED THIS TO MY PASSENGER TWICE OVER, BY GENTLY LETTING OFF THE GAS AND APPLYING IT AGAIN... AT WHICH POINT THE VEHICLE'S CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, ACCOMPANIED WITH A LOSS OF TRACTION CONTROL AND STABILITY CONTROL, REDUCED ENGINE POWER, AND SHUDDERING DURING GEAR SHIFTS. THE VEHICLE WAS TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 40MPH AT THE TIME. ASIDE FROM THE AFOREMENTIONED ISSUES, NO OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE WERE OBSERVED.    I ONLY TRAVELED TWO MILES BEFORE EXPERIENCING THESE ISSUES. AS THIS WAS A BRAND NEW CAR ON A TEST DRIVE, IT OBVIOUSLY HAD VERY FEW MILES ON THE ODOMETER.    UPON RETURNING TO THE CAR DEALERSHIP, THE SALES ASSOCIATES PULLED THE CAR BACK ONTO THE SALES LOT, MOVED OTHER NEW CARS OUT OF THE WAY, AND PARKED THE CAR AMONGST OTHER NEW VEHICLES FOR SALE. THE VEHICLE WAS MOST CERTAINLY NOT PULLED INTO THE SERVICE DRIVE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THIS IS UNSETTLING NEWS.    I HAVE NO FAITH THAT THE VEHICLE WAS PROPERLY INSPECTED, NOR DO I HAVE FAITH THAT THE DEALERSHIP WILL RESPONSIBLY HANDLE THIS MATTER. IT IS MY RECOMMENDATION THAT GM WITHDRAWS THIS VEHICLE FROM DEALER INVENTORY AND PERFORMS AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF THE VEHICLE.    *JS    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",
