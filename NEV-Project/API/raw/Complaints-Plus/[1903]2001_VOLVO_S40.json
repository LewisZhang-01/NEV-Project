IF THE DRIVER'S FOOT IS NOT COMPLETELY ON THE BRAKE WHEN IT IS DEPRESSED THE GAS PEDAL CAN BE INADVERTANTLY PRESSED.  THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE GAS PEDAL AND BRAKE PEDAL IS 62 MM (2.44 INCHES).  I BELIEVE THIS PROBLEM IS THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM THAT THE AUDI WAS HAVING WHEN DRIVERS THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE PUSHING ON THE BRAKE WHEN HALF THEIR FOOT WAS ON THE GAS. HAVING THE PEDALS ON DIFFERENT LEVELS AVOIDS THIS PROBLEM COMPLETELY.  LOOK AT THE OLD VW BUG WITH ITS RESTRICTED SPACE. NO PROBLEM THERE.  I HAVE ALSO REPORTED THIS PROBLEM THE VOLVO.  I WOULD SUGGEST A RISER KIT TO BRING THE BRAKE UP ABOUT AN INCH SO THE DRIVER HAS TO LIFT HIS/HER FOOT UP OFF THE GAS TO DEPRESS THE BRAKE.  I DON'T WANT TO MODIFY THIS CAR SINCE IT IS SO NEW, THE DELER WILL NOT MODIFY IT BECAUSE OF WARRANTEE ISSUES (BY THE WAY THEIR MECHANIC SAID HE HAD THE SAME THING HAPPEN).
