WE'VE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO A FACTORY AUTHORIZED WATER LEAK DETECTION COMPANY, AFTER 1-2 YEARS AND ABOUT $500 IN BILLS, THEY GAVE UP.  THEY FOUND A NEW LEAK EVERYTIME WE BROUGHT THE CAR IN.  AS OF LAST THURSDAY, 2/24/2000 , THEY FINALLY GAVE UP, SAID THEY COULD NOT JUSTIFY FINDING MORE LEAKS!!  IN ALL THEY FOUND 6 LEAKS, NONE OF WHICH WERE FAILED SEALS OR OTHERWISE PARTS THAT WOULD WEAR OUT OVER TIME.   ALL FOUND LEAKS WERE BODY WELDS AND OTHER FACTORY DEFECTS. WE'VE ALSO TAKEN THE CAR TO GLASS INSTALLATION STORES, ETC.  NOBODY, SO FAR CAN DETECT WHERE ALL THE LEAKS ARE COMING FROM.  WATER LEAK TECHNIQUES SAID THAT ALL OF THE LEAKS THEY FOUND WERE FACTORY DEFECTS.  WHAT'S OUR NEXT STEP?  WE JUST WANT A DRY CAR.   OUR 2ND & 3RD PROBLEM MAY BE RELATED, AND HAVE BEEN OCCURING ALMOST SINCE THE CAR WAS NEW.  BASICALLY, THE CAR WILL STALL WHILE DRIVING SLOWLY.  LIKE WHEN STARTING OUT AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT OR DRIVING THROUGH A PARKING LOT.  THE NEXT PROBLEM, THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTS ROUGHLY, USUALLY WHEN THE ENGINE IS WARM, SOMETIMES THE TRANSMISSION HAS TROUBLE SHIFTING INTO THE NEXT GEAR, ALMOST LIKE THE \"BRAIN\" DOESN'T TELL IT TO SHIFT.
