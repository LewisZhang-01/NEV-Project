ON SATURDAY, MAY 3, MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING AND PULLING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE. HE HEARD A GRINDING NOISE AS HE BACKED OUT, THEN HEARD SOMETHING BREAK AND THE CAR WOULDN'T MOVE. WE COULDN'T EVEN PUSH THE CAR BACK INTO THE PARKING SPACE, AS THE TIRE/ARM APPEARED TO BE DETACHED. WE FOUND OUT THE RIGHT CONTROL ARM HAD RUSTED THROUGH COMPLETELY, ALSO CAUSING DAMAGE OF THE AXLE.

TOOK VEHICLE TO MECHANIC AND DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM, THEY PULLED UP THE RECALL NOTICE.  CONTACTED HYUNDAI AND WAS TOLD THAT MY CAR \"JUST MISSED\" THE RECALL.  RECALL EFFECTED THROUGH NOVEMBER 9, 2003 AND MY CAR WAS MADE DECEMBER 17, 2003.  THEREFORE I WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR THE FUEL TANK ASSEMBLY VALVE RECALL ID # 04V369000 - FUEL SYSTEM, GASOLINE:STORAGE   A VALVE ON THE FUEL TANK ASSEMBLY MAY NOT CLOSE PROPERLY. IF A VEHICLE ROLLS OVER AND THE FUEL TANK ASSEMBLY VALVE IS NOT PROPERLY CLOSED, FUEL SPILLAGE MAY OCCUR. AFTER BEING TOLD I DID NOT QUALIFY FOR THE RECALL I TAKE MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT STATES, FOUND CANISTER ASSEMBLY  COME APART INTERNALLY RESTRICTING VALVE. THE COST WAS GOING TO BE $450.00 PLUS TAX AND LABOR. TRIED TO FIND A BETTER DEAL AND ALL MECHANICS ARE TELLING ME HYUNDAI IS REFUSING TO FIX THE FUEL TANKS ON SOME CARS, BUT ALL THE MECHANICS ARE DOING IS REPLACING THE FUEL TANK ASSEMBLY VALVE AND VEHICLES ARE RUNNING FINE WITH NO FURTHER COMPLAINTS.  HYUNDAI IS RIPPING OFF CUSTOMERS BY FAILING TO INCLUDE ALL CARS AFFECTED BY THIS RECALL.  AFTER TALKING TO SEVERAL MECHANICS THEY SAY IS ONCOMING FOR A CANISTER ASSEMBLY TO COME APART (NOTING IT COULD HAPPEN, BUT RARELY). THE HYUNDAI PEOPLE ARE SAYING MY CAR IS NOT \"SENSING\" WHEN IT IS FULL.  WHICH SOUNDS LIKE THE EXACT THING THE RECALL IMPLIES.  I'M IN THE PROCESS OF GATHERING THE MONEY TO HAVE THIS DONE (NOT AT THE DEALERSHIP) AND SEE IF IT FIXES MY PROBLEM AS WELL.    *TR",

I CONTACTED THE AUTO SHOP THAT REPLACED THE VALVE AND WAS TOLD IT DID NOT SOUND LIKE IT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT WAS FIXED BUT TO LET HIM KNOW AFTER I HAD ANOTHER SHOP LOOK AT IT (SINCE I WAS 1.5 HRS AWAY). I CALLED THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER AND EXPLAINED THE SITUATION. WHILE WAITING FOR THE TRUCK, ABOUT AN HOUR LATER, I STARTED THE ENGINE SO MY FATHER COULD LISTEN TO THE ENGINE AND MY ENGINE REVVED TO 7000 RPM JUST TURNING IT ON. IT WAS IN PARK AT THE TIME. I IMMEDIATELY TURNED IT OFF AND DIDN'T ATTEMPT TO START IT AGAIN. UPON THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER'S ARRIVAL, I EXPLAINED WHAT HAD HAPPENED EACH TIME. HE STARTED THE CAR, REVERSED IT, PUT IT INTO DRIVE AND IT ACCELERATED ON ITS OWN A THIRD TIME WHILE IN DRIVE. HE TURNED THE ENGINE OFF AND LOADED IT ONTO THE TRUCK. UPON INVESTIGATING ANY CAUSES, HE TOLD ME HE CLEANED OUT THE THROTTLE AND IT WAS RUNNING FINE. HE TEST DROVE IT SEVERAL TIMES AND SAID THERE IS NO INDICATION OF THE PROBLEM HAPPENING AGAIN BUT OF COURSE CANNOT GUARANTEE IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. THIS IS CLEARLY AN INDICATION THAT THE PROBLEM MAY NOT BE FIXED AND NOONE CAN TELL ME WHETHER ITS SAFE TO DRIVE OR NOT. I'M SCARED FOR MY OWN SAKE AND FOR THE SAKE OF MY 3 YOUNG CHILDREN.

I GOT OUT OF THE CAR TO LOOK AT THE FRONT RIGHT WHEEL, AND SAW THAT IT WAS TURNED IN TOWARDS THE CENTER OF THE CAR, AND BENT UNDER THE FRONT OF THE CAR, ABOUT 1/4\" AWAY FROM THE BACK OF THE WHEEL WELL, WHILE MY OTHER FRONT WHEEL WAS AIMED STRAIGHT AHEAD. I DROVE THE CAR 100 FEET TO A SAFE PLACE OFF THE STREET, DURING WHICH TRIP THE STEERING WHEEL TRIED TO SPIN WILDLY IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS, AND THE CRUNCHING, JOLTING NOISES AND MOTIONS CONTINUED. THE CAR WAS NOT DRIVABLE, SO I CALLED A FLATBED TOW TRUCK, WHO TOWED IT TO MY MECHANIC..     WHEN THE MECHANIC WAS ABLE TO LOOK AT THE VEHICLE, HE DETERMINED THAT THE CONTROL ARM HAD COMPLETELY SNAPPED IN HALF, AS A RESULT OF RUST CORROSION FROM THE INSIDE OUT.  VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE CONTROL ARM CONFIRMED THAT THE METAL IT IS CONSTRUCTED OUT OF WAS CORRODED DOWN TO A THICKNESS OF APPROXIMATELY 5 OR 6 SHEETS OF PAPER.  WATER KICKED UP FROM WET ROADS BY THE TIRES HAD GOTTEN INSIDE THE CONTROL ARM (THROUGH A FAULTY SEAL) AND, AS THERE ARE NO DRAINAGE HOLES IN THE CONTROL ARM, IT REMAINED INSIDE, EATING AWAY AT THE METAL UNTIL FINALLY THE WEIGHT OF THE CAR SNAPPED THE ARM IN HALF.  THIS FAILURE OF THE CONTROL ARM ALSO WRECKED THE SUSPENSION OF THE CAR, AS WELL AS THE CV SHAFT, THE RIGHT FRONT AXLE, AND THE SWAY BAR LINKS.  THE CONTROL ARM, THE CV SHAFT, AND THE SWAY BAR LINKS HAD TO BE COMPLETELY REPLACED, AND THE CAR NEEDED A REALIGNMENT.  *TR",

AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE I WAS ADVISED THAT ALL USED CARS ARE CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED VEHICLES AND ARE PUT THROUGH A 135 POINT CHECK PRIOR TO BEING PUT ON THE LOT.
