THIS 2ND TRANSMISSION HAS NOW FAILED 3,184 MILES EARLIER THAN THE FIRST, AFTER ONLY 41,476 MILES (CAR MILEAGE 86,136)! I PURCHASED MY CAR AT NORWOOD DODGE. BOTH NORWOOD DODGE AND CHRYSLER IN DETROIT REFUSED TO FINANCIALLY COVER THE REPLACEMENT COSTS FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION. (7/70 CONTRACT HAD EXPIRED BY MILES, NOT TIME).  I AM OUTRAGED THAT I AM NOW FORCED TO INSTALL A THIRD TRANSMISSION IN THE SAME CAR.

WE (OR OTHERS) COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IF DRIVING ON A BUSY HIGHWAY AT HIGH SPEEDS.
