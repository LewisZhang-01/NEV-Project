I took it to my local Chevrolet dealership. Five different times, because they were not able to get the occurrence to duplicate for them. They replaced the ignition, as well as other suspected parts with no resolution. Resolution. Ended up costing me over $1,200. That was the first time I took it in for this issue. The other four times didn't cost me anything because they hadn't fixed the issue. Come to find out it was a wire on the body control module that had some of the insulation sheathing removed, which then in turn caused the wire to ground out on the car's frame. Just thought I would put this out there in case anybody else goes through it because it wasn't real inconvenience.",

MY CONCERN IS THAT THE VEHICLE NEVER PROVIDED ANY TYPE OF NOTIFICATION LETTING ME KNOW THAT THE VEHICLE WAS SEVERELY DAMAGED. IF MY OIL IS LOW MY VEHICLE TELLS ME SOMETHING, WHEN THE TIRES ARE LOW ON AIR, MY VEHICLE TELLS ME. HOW COME WHEN MY VEHICLE CAUGHT FIRE AND WHILE IT BEGAN STALLING OUT I STILL RECEIVED NO NOTICE?    I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED HAD I GOT HIT BY ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND THE SITUATION MAY HAVE ENDED A LOT WORSE. I HAD MY VEHICLE TOWED TO THE NEAREST REPAIR SHOP AS COVERED UNDER THE USAA ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE ENDORSEMENT THAT BEING CHEVROLET SANDS. I RECEIVED A CALL FROM A REP WHO STATED THAT THE VEHICLE HAD HAD PRE-EXISTING DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE SUCH AS OLD BATTERY ACID THAT HAD OVER TIME ATE AT THE WIRING OF THE VEHICLE CAUSING THE TRANSMISSION TO BLOW OUT. THIS VEHICLE IS A DEATH TRAP. I MENTIONED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS A CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED VEHICLE AND THAT THE VEHICLE WAS ONLY IN OUR CARE FOR LESS THAN A YEAR IN A HALF AND THAT WHEN WE BOUGHT THE VEHICLE IT CONTAINED 20,022 MILES AND THAT THE VEHICLE NOW ONLY HAD ABOUT 65,000 MILES. NONE OF THE SECURITY FEATURES EVER TURNED ON THE AUTO STOP FUNCTION DOESN'T OPERATE, THE BATTERY WAS BUILT ON TOP OF THE TRANSMISSION SAFETY ISSUE. THE  IGNITION CUT OFF DEVICE DIDN'T WORK.",

I HAVE RECENTLY VISITED A LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALER TO CHECK IF THE SIMILAR ISSUE EXISTS IN NEWER VEHICLES, DEALERSHIP CONFIRMED THAT DESIGN OF THE HEADLIGHTS AND THEIR HOUSING IS THE SAME AND HAS CHANGED IN LAST FEW YEARS.

I LOOKED AT THE DASH AND THE FOLLOWING ERROR LIGHTS WERE ON (SERVICE ENGINE SOON, CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, REDUCED ENGINE POWER, AND STABLITRACK LIGHT).

I WAS BACKING MY CAR INTO THE SPOT.  THE CAR WAS STOPPED AND I REMOVED MY SAFETY BELT AND LOWERED THE WINDOW.  I PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE AND DEPRESSED THE ACCELERATOR TO PROCEED INTO THE LINED PARKING SPOT.  THE CAR PROCEEDED AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED INTO A CONCRETE WALL.  THERE WERE NO OBSTRUCTIONS AND THE ACCELERATOR WAS NOT FULLY DEPRESSED WHEN THIS OCCURRED.  I IMMEDIATELY TOOK MY FOOT OFF OF THE ACCELERATOR AND HIT THE BRAKE BUT THE BRAKE  DID NOT RESPOND SINCE THIS ALL OCCURRED IN ROUGHLY IN SECONDS AND APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET IN LENGTH.  UPON IMPACT A SMOKE FILLED THE CABIN AREA.  I HIT MY HEAD AGAINST THE HEADREST AND SLIGHTLY INTO THE STEERING WHEEL.  ANOTHER PARKING PATRON SAW THIS ALL PLAY OUT AND CAME TO MY AID.  IT WAS A HORRIFIC INCIDENT.  I AM THANKFUL AND LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.  IT WAS AS IF THE CAR ACTED ON IT'S OWN.  AFTER PUTTING THE CAR IN PARK ALL OF THE LIGHTS IN THE CAR AND THE FLASHER WERE ON.  ONSTAR NOTIFIED ME TO ASK IF I WAS OK.  I EXPLAINED TO HER WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  AFTER TWO HOURS NO ONE CAME TO MY AID DESPITE BEING TOLD SOMEONE WAS DISPATCHED.  THE BATTERY WENT DEAD AND IT WAS AT THAT TIME I CONTACTED AAA TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED OUT OF THE GARAGE.  IT IS CURRENTLY IN \"BRENDAN'S COLLISION, LTD, 210 W. HILLCREST AVENUE, HAVERTOWN, PA.  I CONTACTED GM IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ACCIDENT AND THEY TOOK A REPORT.  THE CAR WAS PURCHASED IN JULY 2016 AND HAD 3021 MILES ON IT.  IT WAS SURREAL AND I WAS FULLY AWARE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING DURING THIS WHOLE ORDEAL.",
