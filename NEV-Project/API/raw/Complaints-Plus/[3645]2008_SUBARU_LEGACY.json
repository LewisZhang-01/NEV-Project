BERTERA INFORMED ME THAT MY CAR SHOULD BE READY FOR THE END OF THE DAY.  AT 4:00 PM BERTERA CALLED TO TELL ME THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT MY CAR AND WOULD NOT GET TO IT FOR THE REST OF THE DAY. DISAPPOINTED WITH THE CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND STILL WONDERING WHAT WAS WRONG WITH MY AIR BAG I HAD TO MAKE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT FOR MONDAY JULY 13TH.     ON MONDAY BERTERA INFORMED ME THAT MY CAR WAS \"CLEARED OF ALL RECALLS\" YET MY AIRBAG SENSOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED FOR $384 AND IF I DIDN'T REPLACE IT I WILL STILL HAVE TO PAY $120 FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND THAT IT IS A SAFETY HAZARD TO CONTINUE DRIVING  BECAUSE IF I GOT IN AN ACCIDENT THE AIRBAGS WOULD NOT DEPLOY.  I INSTANTLY LOOKED ONLINE WHERE I SAW HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS FROM SUBARU OWNERS WITH AIRBAG PROBLEMS.  WHEN I RECEIVED THE COPY OF MY SERVICE THE AIRBAG LIGHT ERROR WAS CODE 26. THERE WAS POWER AND GROUND ON INPUT SIDE, BUT THE INDICATOR \"INTERNALLY SHORTED\".  SINCE THE AIRBAG DOES NOT WORK WHEN THE LIGHT ISN'T WORKING PROPERLY THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.  I URGE THE NHTSA TO LET ALL POTENTIALLY AFFECTED OWNERS KNOW ABOUT IT.

IT RECOMMENDED TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER IMMEDIATELY. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE SUBARU DEALER I HAVE ALWAYS HAD SERVICE DONE, AND THEY TOLD ME THE \"LAMP ASSEMBLY - MAP\" HAD AN ELECTRICAL SHORT IN IT AND NEEDED REPLACED. AN \"ELECTRICAL SHORT\"? THAT SOUNDS VERY SERIOUS. WITH PARTS AND LABOR, THE COST CAME IN AT $389.30, WHICH SEEMED QUITE EXCESSIVE. AS CRITICAL AS AIRBAG SYSTEMS ARE, IT WOULD BE REASONABLE TO THINK THAT THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM SHOULD WARRANT A SAFETY RECALL, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE WARNING IN THE OWNER'S MANUAL THAT THE SYSTEM MAY NOT FUNCTION AT ALL IF NOT TAKEN CARE OF.

AUTOMOBILE WAS TAKEN TO DEALERSHIP FOR 15K SERVICING AND WAS TOLD THAT CONDENSATION BUILDUP IS NORMAL DURING TRANSITIONAL SEASONS (SPRING/FALL).  HOWEVER I PRESUME THAT THE MOISTURE IS CAUSING TEMPORARY DISRUPTION OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AS THE LIGHTS FUNCTION INTERMITTENTLY.  OFTEN WHEN THE CAR IS STARTED AND THE LIGHTS ARE TURNED ON, ONLY ONE OF THE LIGHTS WILL COME ON.  AFTER TURNING THE LIGHTS ON AND OFF SEVERAL TIMES THEY WILL BOTH WORK.  I AM AFRAID THAT I WILL BE IN A POSITION WHERE BOTH LIGHTS STAY OFF AND WILL NOT COME ON FORCING ME TO DRIVE WITHOUT HEADLIGHTS. *TR",
