I PULLED THE SUN VISOR DOWN AS I DROVE, PUSHED IT OVER AGAINST THE DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW AND EXTENDED IT TO COVER THE LENGTH OF THE GLASS AS IT IS INTENDED TO DO. WHILE TURNING LEFT OFF OF A 6 LANE ROAD ONTO A PARKWAY THE VISOR MOVED TO TOUCH THE SIDE OF MY HEAD. I REACHED UP TO PUSH IT BACK AND MY LEFT HAND FINGERS TOUCHED THE BAR THAT HOLDS THE VISOR AND IT PAINFULLY BURNED MY FINGERS AS I PUSHED IT BACK TO THE WINDOW!!! STILL NO WARNING LIGHTS. TO BE SURE IT WAS THAT HOT AND NOT WANTING TO TOUCH IT AGAIN, I HELD A PLASTIC CUT UP TO THE BAR AND SMOKE APPEARED AND IT MELTED THE RIM OF THE CUP.  I WAS PETRIFIED AS I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC ON A 6 LANE PARKWAY & AFRAID A FLASH FIRE WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN NEAR MY FACE AND HEAD . GOT TO WORK & AS I AM A NURSE IMMEDIATELY TREATED THE WOUNDS/BURNS WITH SILVADENE AND A DRESSING. ASKED ONE OF MY SURGEONS WHAT TO DO AND HE SAID TAKE THE CAR IMMEDIATELY TO A CHEV DEALER AS IT MAY CATCH FIRE!!!!!!!!!!! TOOK IT IN, THEY SAW MY HAND BANDAGED UP , CHECKED THE CAR IN AND INSPECTED IT AND FOUND A SHORT IN THE WIRE FROM THE MAP LIGHTS TO THE VISOR!!  THEY REPLACED THE WIRING AND THE VISOR.  WE LOOKED FOR ALL RECALLS AND FOUND NOTHING ON THIS PROBLEM.  I ASKED IF THEY HAD SEEN THIS BEFORE AND THEY SAID NO, SO I THOUGHT IT BEST TO CONTACT YOUR AGENCY IN CASE IT HAPPENS TO SOMEONE WITH KIDS, OR DISABLED PEOPLE ETC IN THE CAR THAT HAD TO BE HELPED TO GET OUT QUICKLY!!

I REPEATED THIS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG, THEN WHEN I GRASPED THE ROD THAT THE VISOR SLIDES ON MY FINGERS WERE BURNED AND BLISTERED.BECAUSE IT WAS SO HOT. THE CABIN LIGHTS FLICKER AND THE HEADLIGHTS DO AS WELL. THE CEILING AREA BY THE VISOR BECOMES VERY HOT TO THE TOUCH. WHEN THE CAR IS OFF, IT BEGINS TO COOL. I THINK THIS HAS BEEN COMING ON FOR A WHILE BECAUSE OF THE FLICKERING, BUT I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT MIGHT ALL BE RELATED. BY THE WAY, I HAD MY CAR LESS THAN 9 MONTHS WHEN THE BATTERY DIED.

MY CAR SUDDENLY LOST ENGINE POWER AND DROPPED TO 45MPH WITHIN SECONDS. THE STABILITRAC, TRACTION CONTROL AND ENGINE LIGHTS CAME ON. I COULD NOT GET MY CAR TO GO OVER 50 MPH ON INTERSTATE. WHEN I ARRIVED HOME I CALLED CHEVY CORPORATION AND MADE A REPORT. I DROPPED MY VEHICLE OFF AT MY LOCAL DEALER ON 6/22. THEY SAID IT WAS REPAIRED AND READY FOR PICK UP ON 6/24. THEY REPLACED THE PEDAL SYSTEM AND SAID THE ROAD TEST WAS GOOD AND MY VEHICLE WAS SAFE TO DRIVE. MY FAMILY AND I LEFT FOR VACATION IN THIS VEHICLE ON 6/27/15. WE DIDN'T THINK WE WOULD HAVE ANY RECURRING ISSUES. HALF WAY THROUGH OUR TRIP AT 80MPH ON THE HIGHWAY OUR CAR REDUCED ENGINE POWER AND DROPPED TO 45MPH WITHIN SECONDS. THE ONLY OPTION WAS TO PULL OFF ALONG HE HIGHWAY WITH OUR THREE CHILDREN IN THE VEHICLE. MY HUSBAND TURNED THE CAR OFF AND ON REPEATEDLY UNTIL THE LIGHTS FINALLY WENT OFF. WE TRAVELED A FEW MILES TO THE NEXT EXIT NOT ABLE TO DRIVE PAST 45MPH. THE THIRD AND FOURTH TIMES HAPPENED ON THE WAY HOME FROM VACATION  ON 7/5/15. THE THIRD TIME THE VEHICLE DROPPED FROM 80MPH TO 40 MPH. THE FOURTH TIME WAS 75 MPH SBD MY HUSBAND PUT THE VEHICLE IN NEUTRAL SO IT WASN'T SUCH A DRASTIC CHANGE IN SPEED. BOTH OF THESE TIMES WE HAD TO PULL OFF THE HIGHWAY WITH OUR THREE CHILDREN ON HE VEHICLE. THIS VEHICLE IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE!!! I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH CHEVROLET CORP.
