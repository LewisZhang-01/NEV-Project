I purchased this vehicle the month before this recall was announced in 2009 and did not start having safety issues until after my new SUV warranty had expired (how convenient). Over the years, I have spent thousands of dollars replacing all kinds of sensors, relays, batteries and various other parts trying to alleviate the unsafe electrical and loss of power issues that this faulty part continues to cause. I have taken this vehicle to my local dealership on countless occasions, complaining that the vehicle intermittently: does not start, the engine suddenly dies while driving on the highway or turning a corner (becoming unsteerable and the brakes won't work), suddenly decelerates, door locks cycle rapidly while driving, the check engine light and other warning lights/alarms come on, headlights and dash lights suddenly shut off, windows or AC stops working, and now the fuel gauge only reads 1/4 tank when I just filled it up. I took the SUV to my local dealer again today, explained the intermittent electrical and loss of power issues and history again and asked why this recall had not been performed or was not scheduled to be performed at any previous time that I had brought the vehicle in for diagnostics or service on these related issues. The service manager admitted that the recall had never been performed, but denied the possibility of the FSCM causing any of these issues, regardless of the recall notice stating they were. He then refused to perform the recall and said I needed to pay $380 to have another diagnostic scan performed. Never scheduling/performing the recall when the SUV was serviced countless times for related safety issues as defined in the recall notice that they never mailed to me and refusing to perform the recall today is a violation of the US NTMV Safety Act and should have consequences!",

THE ISSUE ARRISES COMMONLY IN STOP-AND-GO TRAFFIC WHEN THE HYBRID SYSTEM STARTS/STOPS THE GASOLINE ENGINE REGULARLY. I NOTICE IN MANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN SWITCHING GAS/ELECTRIC MODES THE VEHICLE LURCHES FORWARD. THE FEELING IS THE SAME AS LETTING OUT THE CLUTCH QUICKLY ON A VEHICLE WITH A MANUAL TRANSMISSION. I HAVE DONE AS MUCH RESEARCH AS I CAN AND IT APPEARS THE PROBLEM POINTS TO ISSUES WITH THE TRANSMISSION FLUID PUMP(S) AND/OR CONTROL MODULES. WHEN THE SYSTEM OPERATES ON THE GAS ENGINE, THE HYBRID TAHOE'S TRANSMISSION RELIES ON AN ENGINE DRIVEN HYDRAULIC FLUID PUMP. WHEN THE SYSTEM SWITCHES TO ELECTRIC MODE, AN AUXILIARY TRANSMISSION FLUID PUMP TURNS ON, DRIVEN BY AN INDEPENDENT ELECTRIC MOTOR. THE LURCH I DESCRIBED RESULTS FROM WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE A FAILING PUMP OR CONTROL MODULE, OR A COMBINATION OF THE BOTH WHICH ENGAGES GEARS WHEN IT SHOULDN'T.    THIS LURCH IS RATHER DANGEROUS AS I HAVE HAD TO JUMP ON THE BRAKES MANY TIMES TO AVOID REAR ENDING OTHER DRIVERS. I HAVE SPOKEN WITH SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS WHO OWN, DRIVE OR HAVE DRIVEN THESE GMT900 SERIES HYBRIDS (2008-2013 CHEVY TAHOE/SILVERADO HYBRIDS, GMC YUKON HYBRIDS, CADILLAC ESCALADE HYBRIDS) ALL INDIVIDUALS HAVE DESCRIBED THE DREADED LURCH. SOME SAY REPLACING THE ELECTRIC AUXILIARY TRANSMISSION FLUID PUMP SOLVES THE PROBLEM, OTHERS STILL HAVE LURCHING ISSUES. ONE INDIVIDUAL WHO DRIVES A CADILLAC ESCALADE HYBRID CLAIMED TO HAVE ACTUALLY REAR ENDED SOMEONE DUE TO THE UNCONTROLLABLE LURCH.    AS FOR MY PERSONAL CAR, THE LURCH OCCURS IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC AND OCCURS AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK, SOMETIMES MORE.

SOON AFTER I HEARD A CLUCKING NOISE AND THOUGHT I RAN OVER SOMETHING THAT SOUNDED LIKE METAL.  I CHECKED BUT SAW NOTHING, BUT I NOTICED THAT THE BRAKES LOOKED VERY BLUE LIKE THEY HAD BEEN RUNNING HOT.  A SHORT DISTANCE DOWN THE ROAD THE SOUND GOT WORSE.  I CONTACTED A CHEVROLET DEALER.  FORTUNATELY THEY WERE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE ME THE NEXT MORNING.  I DID NOT USE MY CAR FOR THE REST OF THAT DAY. UPON INSPECTION OF THE FRONT NOISE THEY SHOWED ME THAT THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL WAS ABOUT TO FALL OFF AND THE LEFT FRONT WAS GRINDING AND READY TO FAIL.  THE ROTORS HAD TO BE REPLACED DUE TO THE HIGH HEAT, AND BLUING WAS CAUSING CHIPPING OFF AND BRAKE FAILURE.  I SHOULD MENTION THAT  THIS 2009 VEHICLE ONLY HAD 48,793 MILES ON IT, AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE.  THE BEST PART IS THAT THE VEHICLE HAD A FULL INSPECTION ONE WEEK PRIOR TO THE FAILURE.  SO, THE END RESULT WAS THAT BOTH FRONT WHEEL HUB BEARING ASSEMBLIES HAD TO BE REPLACED,  ALONG WITH THE BOTH FRONT ROTORS, BRAKES AND CALIBERS.  THE DEALER TRIED TO TELL ME THAT THE CALIBERS WERE STILL GOOD, HOWEVER I HAD THEM REPLACED BECAUSE THEY WERE ALSO OVERHEATED.  ANYONE WHO KNOWS MECHANICS SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT IN THIS SITUATION AFTER RUNNING HIGHWAY SPEEDS, THAT THERE WOULD BE OVERHEATING OF THE CALIBERS ALONG WITH ROTORS AND BRAKES WHEN THE WHEEL HUBS ARE NOT RUNNING SMOOTH.  I QUESTION WHY THESE WHEEL BEARING FAILED AT SUCH LOW MILEAGE. I TAKE EXCELLENT CARE OF MY VEHICLES.  ON 12/31/2013 AT 40,126 MILES I HAD NEW BRAKES AND ROTORS INSTALLED, AND HAD THE BRAKE FLUID CHANGED.

THE SAME AUTOMATIC LIFT GATE TYPICALLY CLOSES AND REMAINS SHUT WITH A SINGLE BUTTON CLICK.    ON OR AROUND MAY 28TH, 2015, MY SON WAS PLACING SEVERAL ITEMS IN THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE WHEN THE LIFTGATE BEGAN SHUTTING ON HIM. IN AN ATTEMPT TO HOLD THE LIFTGATE OPEN, IT CONTINUED TO CLOSE FORCEFULLY WITHOUT RAISING BACK UP.

AFTER CHECKING THE VIN, THE DEALERSHIP STATED THAT NO ACTIVE RECALLS WERE FOUND AND THAT THE FUEL MODULE HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO TOO MUCH WATER.

BELOW ARE THE VARIOUS ISSUES THAT I AM EXPERIENCING:      1. PERIODICALLY, THE DOOR LOCKS WILL CYCLE UP AND DOWN AND THE POWER ON THE DASH (RADIO, HEADLIGHTS, ETC) GOES BLACK AND THE VEHICLE SPUTTERS LIKE IT'S GOING TO DIE (EVEN WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY)  2.

SOMETIMES, THE VEHICLE WON'T START (NOTHING HAPPENS)   4. THE CD PLAYER SOUNDS LIKE THE MOTOR INSIDE IS CONSTANTLY RUNNING.  THE DEALER (THEAUTOPARK.NET) SAID THIS IS A COOLING FAN...BUT IT ALWAYS RUNS?   5. THE VEHICLE WILL COMPLETELY DIE WHEN PLACING THE CAR IN PARK AND SHUTTING OFF THE ENGINE (NO POWER....NOTHING.  COASTS TO A HALT.)      NOTE: WE'VE ALREADY REPLACED THE BATTERY AND STILL HAVE ALL OF THE AFOREMENTIONED ISSUES.    UPDATE: THE IGNITION SWITCH REPLACEMENT WAS A HUGE FAIL. ON THE WAY HOME LAST NIGHT, THE VEHICLE DID SOME REALLY WACKY THINGS WHEN I USED MY TURN SIGNAL (THE VEHICLE SLOWED DRAMATICALLY WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND THE HEADLIGHTS AND DASH LIGHTS FLICKERED OFF AND ON). ALL OF THIS HAS MADE ME ANGRY ENOUGH THAT I DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY OVERNIGHT TO REBOOT THE COMPUTER....I DON'T KNOW IF THIS HELPED OR WORKED, BUT I AM DESPERATE ENOUGH TO TRY ANYTHING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE MY FAMILY'S SAFETY IS IN JEOPARDY.  *TR",

THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN IN SERVICE AT TWO DIFFERENT GM DEALERSHIPS FOR 7 OF 8 WEEKS OF OWNERSHIP FOR AN ARRAY OF ISSUES CULMINATING IN TWO SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERNS PERTAINING TO THE HYBRID SYSTEM. IT WAS PLACED IN SERVICE FOR A SURGING/LUNGING PROBLEM AND SELF-ACCELERATION. THE DEALERSHIP CLAIMED TO HAVE REPAIRED THE PROBLEM, BUT IT STILL EXISTS ON A CONSTANT BASIS. WHEN RETURNING IT TO SERVICE, THEY THEN SAID THAT THE HYBRID SYSTEM WAS \"SEARCHING FOR HIGHER RPM'S SO THAT IT COULD CONVERT MODES BETWEEN BATTERY AND ENGINE POWER\". IT WILL REV FROM A 600 RPM RANGE TO 2000 RPM'S WITHOUT NOTICE IN TRAFFIC, CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO SURGE FORWARD.  SECOND ISSUE...WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE BETWEEN SERVICE STAYS, I NOTICED THAT I WOULD GET A TIGHTNESS IN MY CHEST AND SERIOUS HEADACHES, WITH NO HEALTH HISTORY OF THESE PROBLEMS. MY WIFE HAS A PACEMAKER AND WAS SERIOUSLY AFFECTED THE SAME WAY, WITH JABBING PAINS IN HER HEAD, CHEST PAINS AND A TIGHTNESS IN HER NECK DURING AND SHORTLY AFTER RIDING IN THE VEHICLE. SHE DOES NOT HAVE THESE SYMPTOMS AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE.  IT TOOK US SEVERAL OUTINGS IN THE TRUCK TO ASSOCIATE THE SYMPTOMS TO THE RIDE. I DECIDED TO CHECK THE VEHICLE WITH A VOLT METER AND FOUND THAT WHILE RUNNING, THE METER DETECTED 5-15 MILLIVOLTS OF ELECTRICITY IN THE SEAT RAILS OF THE PASSENGER SEAT. WHEN I RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN, THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN ACCOMPANIED ME FOR A TEST DRIVE AND WAS VISIBLY CONFUSED AND SPEAKING DIFFERENTLY AFTER 20 MINUTES IN THE TRUCK. THE NEXT DAY, I RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP, STILL CONCERNED ABOUT THE ELECTRICAL PROBLEM. THE SERVICE WRITER WAS SHOCKED WHEN HE OPENED THE PASSENGER DOOR. THEY KEPT THE VEHICLE 8 DAYS, DECLARED IT SAFE AS COMPARED TO ANOTHER HYBRID ON THEIR LOT, AND SENT ME AWAY WITHOUT RESOLVE. THE NEXT DAY, WE TALKED TO A GM REPRESENTATIVE THAT SAID THEY WOULD NOT WORK ON THE VEHICLE AGAIN FOR ANY REASON AND WARRANTY IS VOID. *TR",
