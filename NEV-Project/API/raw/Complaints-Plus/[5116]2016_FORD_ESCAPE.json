The mechanic did not have the lug nuts available and I had to pay for labor. The reason the mechanic gave for not removing the swollen lug nuts was the lug nuts are likely to break during removal.   In the event I have a flat tire, I would either be unable to remove the nuts myself or would drive with possibly damaged lug nuts. Damaged lug nuts could cause undue stress on other lug nuts, leading to breaks. Broken lug nuts mean tires can fly off cars. This seems like a major safety issue that Ford needs to address.",

        "summary": "A few months ago, out of nowhere and with no warning my 2016 Ford Escape flashed a transmission failure and car immediately started having acceleration issues. I was on a 8 lane highway (4 lanes each direction), in the far left lane as I was approaching my left hand turn lane. I had to pull over on this 8 lane highway on the far left lane causing a major safety hazard, not only for myself, but for all the cars in the south bound direction. Once traffic had a break, I started my car back up and was able to make the next left hand turn (which was actually the turn lane I needed to take) to get off an extremely 8 lane highway. This left hand turn also could have caused a safety issue as I wasn't able to accelerate at a normal rate and had to coast across this highway going around 5mph. I immediately pulled over after that turn and got the car towed to the nearest Ford dealership. The tow truck driver wished I had pulled over a little further up since he would have to stop traffic to get the car on the tow bed, obviously something I couldn't do since I was unable to accelerate. When the car was turned back on no transmission warning was on. Ford did replace the battery and confirmed multiple internal transmission component failures with the diagnosis and the transmission would have to be replaced. I did get a second opinion and they also confirmed the failures that the Ford dealership told me. The car is only 5 years old, gave me no indication that there was anything wrong until it happened, there was zero warning, zero noise, zero reasoning given as how/why a car only 5 years old would have multiple internal failing transmission components! I was also told by the mechanic that this is not an uncommon occurrence for Fords to have early transmission failures and that my 2016 Ford Escape was the 6th Ford that month!!! In total, I have had to pay over $6,100 worth of work/service/equipment in a 2016 car I purchased on 2/25/19! Official explanation would be great!!!",

THE WIRE HARNESS HAD WORN THROUGH THE WRAP AND EVENTUALLY ONE OF THE WIRES IN THE BUNDLE ATOP THE MOTOR MADE INTERMITTENT CONTACT WITH A PART OF THE MOTOR. THIS CAUSED THE PCM TO THROW NUMEROUS CODES AND DISABLE CRITICAL SAFETY SYSTEMS. RANDOM, ERRATIC AND UNPREDICTABLE. WIRE BUNDLE ALIGNED WITH THE FUEL RAIL BEGINS AT THE DRIVER SIDE OF THE MOTOR. AT THE POINT WHERE IT BEGINS UP COME TO THE MOTOR THERE IS A POST (ALUMINUM, TOP, FRONT, DRIVERS' SIDE OF MOTOR). THIS WIRE BUNDLE WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED FROM CHAFFING. THE REMAINDER OF THE WIRE IS WELL SECURED AND INSULATED BUT THIS POINT IS LITERALLY AND ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN. THIS WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND AS THE PROBLEM AS IT WAS SO INTERMITTENT. NOT COVERED UNDER 5/60 WARRANTY AND MY DEALER CHARGED ME $318.00. IN TOTAL I'VE SPENT OVER $600 THE GETTING THIS FIGURED OUT AND RESOLVED. THIS LAST BREAKDOWN PLACED MY FAMILY IN GREAT DANGER AS THERE WAS NO SAFE PLACE TO GET OFF THE ROAD (70 MPH INTERSTATE WITH LITTLE SHOULDER AND MERGING STATE HIGHWAY).

THE ESCAPE HAD TO BE TOWED INTO THE NEAREST FORD DEALERSHIP, CHAMPION FORD ' EDINBORO, PA. UPON INSPECTION OF MY VEHICLE THE SERVICE MANAGER INDICATED AN INNER SEAL WITHIN THE TRANSMISSION HAD FAILED. THIS RESULTED IN TRANSMISSION FLUID ENTERING ALL AREAS OF THE TRANSMISSION AN ESSENTIAL RUINING THE UNIT. THE SERVICES MANAGER'S RECOMMENDATION WAS REPLACEMENT OF THE TRANSMISSION. THIS WAS DONE WITH THE PURCHASE OF A NEW TRANSMISSION AND THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO ME ON FEBRUARY 27, 2019.    MY FIRST DISAPPOINTMENT WAS THE TRANSMISSION OF A 2016 ESCAPE FAILING IN LITTLE OVER THREE YEARS SINCE PURCHASE (OCTOBER 2015). THE SECOND DISAPPOINT WAS THE FAILURE OF THE TRANSMISSION JUST AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRED. MY ESCAPE HAD A 5-YEAR/60,000-MILE WARRANTY ON THE POWERTRAIN. AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE I HAD DRIVEN MY ESCAPE 72,000 MILES. THEREFORE, I WAS LEFT WITH A $6232.67 REPAIR BILL ON A VEHICLE I HAD HOPE TO LAST ME SEVEN TO TEN YEARS.    AT THIS POINT I WILL NEED TO KEEP THIS VEHICLE ANOTHER TWO OR THREE YEARS. WHEN I DO BEGIN LOOKING FOR ANOTHER NEW CAR, I NOW BELIEVE I NEED TO START LOOKING AT OUR MANUFACTURER PRODUCTS.

THANKFULLY I HAD NO CARS BEHIND ME SO I POWER IT DOWN AND THEN TUNE IT BACK ON AND IT GIVES A LITTLE ISSUE TURNING BACK ON BUT DOES. I MAKE IT HOME. IT WORKS FINE THE NEXT FEW DAYS. ON 11-27-18 AFTER ONLY DRIVING LOCALLY IN BETWEEN I TAKE MY FORD ON THE HIGHWAY TO GO TO THE AIRPORT 30 MINS AWAY AND ALL IS FINE UNTIL THE RIDE BACK HOME ON THE HIGHWAY. I HEAR THE VIBRATING NOISE AGAIN AS IF I WAS GOING OVER RUMBLE STRIPS ON 95. THE CAR GOES ON A LITTLE LONGER AND THEN SHUTS DOWN AGAIN. POWER REMAINS ON BUT THE CAR STALLS. I AM TAKING IT IN TODAY. I HOPE TO GET THIS RESOLVED AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. I BOUGHT A NEW CAR FOR A REASON. RELIABILITY AND NOW I AM JUST ANNOYED THAT THIS IS HAPPENING WITH ONLY 32K MILES ON THE 2016 ESCAPE.",

CAUSE OF SAFETY RISK: POORLY POSITIONED/CALIBRATED SENSOR WHICH TRIGGERS AUTOMATIC CLOSURE OF REAR LIFTGATE IN SPITE OF FOLLOWING OWNERS MANUAL INSTRUCTIONS. THIS FEATURE IS ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE ACTIVATED WHEN MAKING A FORWARD AND BACK KICKING MOTION OF THE FOOT UNDER THE REAR BUMPER.    SUMMARY:  WAS LOADING GROCERIES INTO BACK OF VEHICLE AT LOCAL WAL-MART EVENING OF 03/14/17 APPROX. 6:30 P.M. CST. I HAD LEANED OVER PLACING BAGS INTO CARGO AREA OF VEHICLE, FEET WERE TOGETHER ON GROUND BEHIND REAR BUMPER, I STRAIGHTENED  AND SMASHED MY HEAD INTO THE METAL FLAT EDGE OF THE LIFTGATE WHICH WAS COMING DOWN ON IT'S OWN WITHOUT ME PRESSING BUTTONS OR MAKING GESTURE TO INITIATE AUTOCLOSE FEATURE. AUDIBLE NOTICE OF CLOSURE WASN'T HEARD DUE TO AMBIENT NOISE - WIND, ETC (THE NOTICE NOISE IS EXTREMELY QUIET). I HIT THE TAILGATE HARD ENOUGH THAT I NEARLY KNOCKED MYSELF OUT, AND MY WIFE WHO HAD ALREADY GOTTEN INTO THE PASSENGER SEAT FELT THE VEHICLE MOVE AND HEARD A LOUD NOISE FROM MY HEAD MAKING CONTACT WITH THE LIFTGATE. I COLLECTED MYSELF, FINISHED LOADING THE GROCERIES AND WENT HOME. PAIN IN MY HEAD INCREASED, NECK PAIN PRESENTED AND INCREASED IN INTENSITY, NAUSEA AND SENSITIVITY TO LIGHT. WIFE RECOMMENDED AND TRANSPORTED ME TO ER. ER VISIT INITIATED APPROXIMATELY 8:30 P.M.  AT TIME OF TRIAGE, I WAS DRY HEAVING AND WAS GIVEN AN ANTI-NAUSEA MEDICATION. THE ER DOCTOR ORDERED A CT OF MY HEAD BASED ON SYMPTOMS PRESENT WHICH CAME BACK OK, BUT IT WAS DETERMINED I RECEIVED A CONCUSSION AND WAS PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS APPROPRIATELY. HEADACHE AND NECK PAIN/STIFFNESS ARE PERSISTENT TODAY 03/15/16. WILL FOLLOW-UP WITH PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN AS INSTRUCTED WITHIN 48-72 HOURS.

THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF SEYMOUR FORD OF JACKSON , MI, WHO HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL, PERFORMED A REPROGRAM OF THE PCM. ON 8/15/16 I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN WITH THE SAME SHUDDERING COMPLAINT. SEYMOUR PHONED THE FORD HOT LINE TO ASCERTAIN IF THERE WERE ANY ADDITIONAL RECALLS. SEYMOUR WAS ADVISED BY FORD TO COMPARE LIKE VEHICLES ON THEIR LOT. THEY TESTED A 2015 AND 2017 ESCAPE \"BOTH HAD SAME ISSUE\" . I WAS INFORMED BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO BE SURE TO KEEP MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE WHEN SHIFTING FROM REVERSE TO DRIVE AND WAIT FOR THE GEAR TO ENGAGE THAN ACCELERATE. I FOUND UNDER COMPLAINTS.COM OTHER OWNERS THROUGHOUT THE US WHO HAVE MADE THE SAME COMPLAINT. ONE HAS EVEN HAD FORD ACKNOWLEDGE THERE IS A PROBLEM AND THEY ARE WORKING ON IT. I INFORMED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT I UNDERSTAND THEY DID NOT BUILD THE CAR; HOWEVER, IF THIS CONTINUES TO OCCUR I WOULD BE BACK. THEY INFORMED ME THEY WERE THERE FOR ME. THAT SAID IT APPEARS EITHER FORD IS NOT TELLING THEIR DEALERS THERE IS A PROBLEM AND OR THEY ARE TELLING THEIR DEALERS TO STONEWALL.
