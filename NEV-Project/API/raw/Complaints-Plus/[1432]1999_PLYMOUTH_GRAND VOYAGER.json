UPON NOTICING  THIS PROBLEM I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT INTO THE DEALER TO HAVE IT FIXED - TO THE TUNE OF $1,500. I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND THE FOLLOWING AT THE APA WEBSITE:  THE APA WEBSITE STATED THAT THE 1996 - 2000 MODELS HAD RUST PERFORATION IN THE FRONT STRUT TOWERS (ESPECIALLY ON THE LEFT SIDE) IN THE AREA OF THE UPPER STRUT. IT STATED THAT THE ANCHORAGE SEEMS TO STEM FROM INSUFFICIENT RUST PROTECTION AND THE USE OF THIN STEEL IN THIS AREA.  THE MECHANIC WHO FIXED THE STRUTS STATED HE HAS SEEN QUITE A FEW WITH THIS PROBLEM AND WISHED MORE PEOPLE WOULD WRITE IN AND COMPLAIN.  ONE PARTICULAR CUSTOMER WAS TOLD NOT TO DRIVE HIS VEHICLE UNTIL HE GOT IT FIXED AS IT WAS THAT BAD. I CONTACTED DAIMLER CHRYSLER CORPORATION ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND THEY BASICALLY SAID THERE WERE NO RECALLS FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM.   FORD RECENTLY RECALLED SOME VEHICLES FOR A LITTLE BIT OF RUST PROBLEM ON THE SIDE OF THE TRUCK, WHICH IN MY OPINION WAS ONLY A COSMETIC TYPE OF PROBLEM.  THE RUSTED STRUTS POSE A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS PROBLEM AND COULD CAUSE SERIOUS INJURIES OR DEATH. I DO NOT HAVE THE OLD PART BUT I DO HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THEM BEFORE THEY WERE FIXED.  I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER.  YOU ARE MY LAST RESORT AND I HOPE IT WILL DO SOME GOOD.  THIS PROBLEM DID NOT CAUSE AN ACCIDENT FOR ME.  HOWEVER, IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO CHECK INTO THE NEXT TIME THERE IS AN ACCIDENT WITH ONE OF THESE VEHICLES. I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND HOPE IT CAN MAKE A LITTLE DIFFERENCE.

AFTER I BACKED OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY TO TAKE MY KIDS TO SCHOOL, I COULD NOT GET THE VEHICLE TO SHIFT OUT OF REVERSE.  I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE I COULD GET IT TO WORK AGAIN.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST WHO REPLACED SEVERAL PARTS.  I CONTINUED TO HAVE PROBLEMS SHIFTING THE TRANSMISSION AND RETURNED TO THE SPECIALIST WHO DISCOVERED THAT CHRYSLER HAD SENT A DEFECTIVE PART.    MY TRANSMISSION BEGAN LEAKING FLUID PROFUSELY IN APRIL 2004.  I TOOK IT TO MY MECHANIC BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS OIL LEAKING FROM THE ENGINE.  HOWEVER, HE IMMEDIATELY TRANSFERRED IT TO THE TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST, AGAIN.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE DIFFERENTIAL PIN INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION IS DEFECTIVE AND IT BREAKS LOOSE, CRACKS THE EXTERIOR OF THE TRANSMISSION CASE, WHICH IN TURN CAUSES THE TRANSMISSION TO STOP FUNCTIONING.  THE VEHICLE IS SUDDENLY RENDERED IMMOBILE.    THE 1999 PLYMOUTH GRAND VOYAGER IS A SAFETY HAZARD BOTH TO ITS OCCUPANTS, AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC.  I TRANSPORT MY YOUNG CHILDREN IN THIS VEHICLE, IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FAMILY VEHICLE, HOWEVER, IT IS NOT SAFE.  THE VEHICLE COULD HAVE CAUSED A CRASH HAD I BEEN ON THE INTERSTATE OR BACKING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY INTO TRAFFIC, WHEN THE DIFFERENTIAL PIN FAILED.  AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE, I HAD LESS THAN 60,000 MILES ON THIS VEHICLE.    THE TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST STATED THAT HE KEEPS TWENTY TRANSMISSIONS OF THIS TYPE (PLYMOUTH, DODGE, CHRYSLER) ON HAND AT ALL TIMES BECAUSE HE FIXES THEM ALL DAY LONG.

THE CLOCKSPRING ASSEMBLY THAT CONNECTS THE STEERING WHEEL MOUNTED ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS TO THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, ON THE MINIVANS, MAY LOSE THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTION TO THOSE COMPONENTS.
