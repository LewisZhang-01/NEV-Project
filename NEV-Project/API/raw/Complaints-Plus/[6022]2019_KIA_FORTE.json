The vehicle was returned to the Dealership. The car was then returned to me, the owner, only to have the Check Engine light come back on, so the car was returned a third time for \"Transmission\" related issues. The vehicle in question has been at the dealership for over two months as the Dealership tells me that they are going \"back and forth with KIA Techline\" to figure out the issue. The initial Transmission failure was confirmed by the KIA Technicians and reproduced prior to the \"Refurbished\" transmission being put in. The vehicle and component have been inspected by the KIA Technicians who say they cannot solve the issue and are currently working with KIA Techline to solve the issue. The only prior symptoms were briefs moments of hesitation in acceleration from the vehicle when on the interstate/freeway. This series of events began at the beginning of December 2021 and the vehicle is still in the shop as of April 3, 2022.",

The transmission does not engage and the car cannot accelerate, which has created severe safety issues, especially on the freeway. We were almost hit by two semi-trucks this last time because the transmission would not engage and would only rev high while traveling on the turnpike in an 80 MPH zone and the car decelerated quickly due to lack of engagement and the RPM gauge just would redline with no movement to the wheels. This has happened several time before but this was the one that scared us the most...each event was scary. The first transmission failure happened at around 20K miles and if the transmission is replaced this time it would be the third replacement transmission within only 10K miles since the care only has 30K miles on it. I have talked with the dealership and Kia Consumer assistance multiple time with no resolutions.

        "summary": "My Kia is experiencing the same problem that Kia has issued a recall on for every year but 2019 Kias. My 2019 Kia is experiencing the same problem from the recall of \"An inconsistent heat-treating process for the piston oil rings can damage the engine and lead to a loss of power, thereby increasing the risk of a crash.\" My 2019 Kia experienced all of this and no help from the dealership as they didn't want to figure out the problem and wanted me to spend thousands of dollars on a problem Kia has recalled many of there makes/models now. My safety was at high danger due to the car stalling during driving. The diagnose was a bad timing chain and after my mechanic I trust more then the dealership and have proof of the problems/diagnosis is now my Kia has two Pistons that are actually shot and caused problems with my oil life in the car. The mechanic believes it could be caused by the same problem/recall stated above on other makes/models. I have know suffered without a car for a few months and my family has suffered tremendously from just needing to get my car fixed but I still continue to pay my monthly payments on my 2019 Kia. Now the shop I have it at says there's 2 bad Pistons and I need an entire new engine.  There was no warnings or check engine light that came on and I just hope there will be an investigation at least on the 2019 models as well and or an answer to why they did 2015 models-2021 but skipped the 2019 Kia Fortes & this investigation of this complaint started after my car was already made and waiting to be sold by a dealer but my car is now experiencing the exact same problems listed above that other Kias have.   I can provide and proper paper work from the mechanic if necessary/upon request.",

THE SECOND TIME IT STARTED SCRAPING I THINK IT SCOOPED SOMETHING UP OFF THE ROAD AND CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE FUEL LINE, BECAUSE WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE CAR TO LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED I SMELLED GASOLINE. THERE WAS A PINHOLE IN THE FUEL LINE AND IT WAS SPRAYING OUT UNDER PRESSURE. THIS FLIMSY PLASTIC PIECE IS THE ONLY THING BETWEEN THE FUEL LINE AND ANY ROAD HAZARDS THAT MIGHT DAMAGE THE FUEL LINE. IF I HADN'T GOTTEN OUT TO CHECK ON IT, MY CAR MIGHT WELL HAVE CAUGHT FIRE! IT'S NOT VERY FAR FROM THE EXHAUST, FORTUNATELY IT WASN'T SPRAYING ON THAT!
