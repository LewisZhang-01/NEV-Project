I spoke with Toyota corporate and they will not honor the recall because the enhancement warranty expired.

The fact still remains that this is a safety hazard with regards to seeing out the front window at night because of the reflection on the shiny/sticky dash.

BY THEN, IT HAD STARTED TO MAKE THE CHEAKING NOISE/THUMPING. I GOT JUST ABOUT TO HER SUMMER SCHOOL (ON FOWLER AVE) AND ALL OF THE LIGHTS ON MY PANEL LIT UP AGAIN. I PULLED OVER AND CALLED MY HUSBAND. I DROVE IT HOME SLOW. WE CALLED TOYOTA, SPOKE TO THE MANAGER, EXPLAINED THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE. I JUST PAID THEM $240 FOR BRAKE PADS THAT I DIDN'T NEED. I REFUSED TO DRIVE THE CAR. THE DEALERSHIP WAS CLOSING IN 1.5HRS WHICH LEFT NO TIME FOR TOW TRUCK. MY HUSBAND DROVE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP, I FOLLOWED IN HIS CAR. TOYOTA (JACOB) GAVE ME A LOANER. 25 JULY 2019, THE MANAGER CALLED AND SAID THE ISSUE WAS THE BRAKE ACTUATOR FAILED AGAIN BUT BECAUSE THE PART WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY A DEFECTIVE (MANAGER ACTUALLY AGREED) WAS ONLY COVERED FOR A YEAR, I'D HAVE TO CONTACT CORPORATE TO SEE IF THEY COULD CHANGE IT OUT AT NO COST. I WILL CALL TOMORROW (26 JULY 2019)...ALTHOUGH, I DO NOT PLAN ON EVER DRIVING THIS CAR AGAIN.",

I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, AS I CAN'T AFFORD TO REPLACE IT. I BELIEVE THE MANUFACTURER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REPLACING IT AS THEY SOLD A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. I'VE LIVED HERE FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS AND HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS WITH ANY OTHER CAR I'VE OWNED, SOME OF WHICH WERE MANY YEARS OLDER THAT MY CURRENT 4-YEAR-OLD TOYOTA CAMRY.   IN ADDITION, WHEN DRIVING AT MORE THAN 60 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY, THE STEERING WHEEL SHAKES WHEN I APPLY THE BRAKES EVEN SLIGHTLY, AND THE CAR VIBRATES. I'VE HAD IT CHECKED TWICE BY A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND THEY CLAIM EVERYTHING IS FINE AND IT'S JUST THE ANTI LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM FUNCTIONING. HOWEVER, THIS CONTINUES TO HAPPEN. IT FEELS UNSAFE TO ME, AND I DON'T BUY THEIR EXPLANATION. AFTER GOOGLING THE PROBLEM, THERE SEEMS TO BE OTHERS WITH THIS PROBLEM ON THE SAME CAR. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE ROTOR IS TOO SMALL FOR THE INCREASED CAMRY SIZE AND THUS BECOMES WARPED. THIS ALSO SHOULD BE EXAMINED AND REPLACED FREE OF COST BY THE MANUFACTURER IF THIS IS THE CAUSE. IN ANY CASE, TOYOTA SHOULD BE FORCED TO LOOK INTO THESE PROBLEMS AND SOLVE THEM WITH NO COST TO THE OWNERS. MANY OF US NO LONGER HAVE WARRANTIES.  *TR",

I WAS TOLD MY BRAKE ACTUATOR HAD GONE OUT AND THE REPAIRS WERE AROUND $2,400 BEFORE TAXES. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS FROM A CHARCOAL CANISTER THAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, ANOTHER $500+. THE PARTS HAD TO BE ORDERED AND IT WAS MAY 30 WHEN MY CAR WAS READY. WHEN QUESTIONING THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT WHY MY BRAKE ACTUATOR HAD GONE OUT, THEY ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS NOTHING I HAD DONE AND THEY SAID THEY'VE HAD PROBLEMS WITH OTHERS GOING OUT. AFTER SEARCHING ONLINE I FOUND THAT OTHER MODELS BY TOYOTA HAVE HAD RECALLS FOR THE BRAKE ACTUATOR. IF THE COMPANY IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE SAME PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN OTHER MODELS, THE RECALL SHOULD BE EXPANDED. MINE WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL, BUT IT WAS FAULTY AND FAILED. AFTER SEARCHING, I ALSO FOUND THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS ISSUES WITH THE CHARCOAL CANISTER AS WELL IN VARIOUS MODELS BY THE COMPANY. PERHAPS RESEARCH SHOULD BE DONE ON THIS ISSUE ALSO.

THE TIRES CURIOUSLY GO UNIFORMLY BALD ON THE FRONT IN LESS THAN 1/3RD OF THE LIFE OF THE TIRE. EACH COMPANY FROM WHICH I HAVE PURCHASED NEW MICHELIN OR BFGOODRICH TIRES FOR THIS CAMRY SAID THIS IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL. THEY STATED THAT THE TIRES SHOULD NOT ORDINARILY BE UNIFORMLY BALD OR BE WORN OUT SO QUICKLY. THEY HAVE ALSO STATED THAT THE VEHICLE MUST HAVE COME OUT OF THE FACTORY ALIGNED THIS WAY, SINCE THE FIRST PAIR WAS USELESS AFTER SO FEW MILES AND THE NEW TIRES ARE WEARING OUT SO QUICKLY.    MOREOVER, THERE ARE ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS WITH THE AC SYSTEM CONTROLS AND THE SENSOR ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE POWER WINDOW. THE AC MYSTERIOUSLY TURNS ITS RECYCLED AIR SWITCH FROM RECYCLED TO VENT (WITHOUT BEING PRESSED TO MAKE THE SWITCH) WHILE DRIVING.  ALSO, THE DRIVER'S SIDE POWER WINDOW WILL GO NEARLY ALL THE WAY UP (WHEN PRESSED), BUT IT STOPS SHORT OF THE TOP AND THEN ROLLS ITSELF BACK DOWN.     THE SERVICE MANAGER AT ROBBIN'S TOYOTA SAID HIS MECHANICS COULD NOT GET THESE PROBLEMS TO RE-OCCUR WHEN DRIVEN, AND THEREFORE, HE COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT FIX THE TWO ISSUES, ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE WAS UNDER WARRANTY AT THE TIME.

SEPT.23 THEY CALLED TO INFORM ME THE ENGINE WAS REMOVED, PHOTOS WERE TAKEN AND SENT TO TOYOTA FOR REVIEW. TOYOTA'S STANCE WAS THEY WERE NOT GOING TO REPLACE THE ENGINE UNDER WARRANTY. TOYOTA CLAIMS THAT AT SOMETIME I ALLOWED THE OIL LEVEL TO GET LOW, CAUSING THE ENGINE TO OVER HEAT AND WHICH LEAD TO THIS FAILURE.

THEY SAID MY FRONT STRUT SHOULD BE REPLACED AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY BECAUSE IT EXPIRED AT 36,000 MILES.  TODAY I JUST WENT TO FIRESTONE TO HAVE MY TIRES ROTATED (I HAD TO PURCHASE NEW TIRES A WHILE BACK {AROUND 20,000 MILES} BECAUSE OF CUPPING FROM MY ORIGINAL TIRES, WHICH TOYOTA ALSO CLAIMED NO RESPONSIBILITY) AND THEY STATED THAT I NEED ALL FOUR STRUTS REPLACED BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL LEAKING.  I CONTACTED TOYOTA, NOT THE DEALER BUT ACTUAL TOYOTA AND I STATED THAT THEY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPLACING THE STRUTS BECAUSE THE VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE THAT MANY MILES ON IT AND THAT THE NOISE DID BEGIN BEFORE THE WARRANTY EXPIRED.  AT THIS POINT THEY ARE HAVING ME PAY A DEALER TO LOOK AT THE STRUTS AND QUOTE A PRICE IF THEY \"FEEL\" THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED.  BUT THE ADVISOR IMMEDIATELY TOLD ME THAT THERE IS NORMAL LEAKING ON STRUTS AND THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT FIRESTONE IS REFERRING TO.

I PUT MY CAR IN THE SHOP THE NEXT MORNING.  BEFORE THE ENGINE WAS EVEN TAKEN APART, THE SERVICE ADVISOR TOLD ME THAT IT SOUNDED LIKE A CAM GEAR HAD BROKE.  AFTER TAKING THE ENGINE APART, SURE ENOUGH, A CAM GEAR HAD BROKE.  MY HUSBAND WAS LATER SPEAKING TO A MECHANIC WHO WAS WORKING ON MY VEHICLE.  MY HUSBAND ASK THE MECHANIC IF THIS WAS JUST A FLUKE DEAL OR IF THE DEALERSHIP HAD SEEN MANY BROKEN CAM GEARS ON TOYOTAS. THE MECHANIC THEN TOLD MY HUSBAND THAT HE PERSONALLY, HAD SEEN SEVERAL OF THESE BROKEN CAM GEARS.  A FEW DAYS LATER THE SERVICE ADVISOR TOLD MY HUSBAND AND I THAT HE WAS NOT SURE WHEN THE CAR WOULD BE REPAIRED BECAUSE THERE IS A NATIONAL BACK ORDER ON THE CAM GEARS FOR THIS CAR.  IS THIS GOING TO BE ANOTHER TOYOTA RECALL?  HOW MANY PEOPLE WHO OWN TOYOTAS HAVE HAD TO REPORT A BROKEN CAM GEAR?  IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE TOYOTA SHOULD KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THIS PART.  IS THIS GOING TO BE ANOTHER BIT OF INFORMATION THAT GETS KEPT FROM CONSUMERS? TOYOTA SHOULD BE LOOKING INTO THIS TO SEE IF THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE CAM GEARS USED ON THEIR VEHICLES. *TR",

I WAS ASSURED THAT ALL ACCELERATOR PEDAL RECALL MODIFICATIONS WERE DONE ON THE CAR BEFORE THE SALE. I WAS STILL NOT SATISFIED. THE MANAGER OF THE SHOP AND I DID A TEST DRIVE AND AFTER A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL AND DESIGN DEFECTS WE JOINTLY AGREED TO TRY AND REPLACE THE PEDAL MECHANISM WITH ONE MADE - NOT BY THE US VENDOR - BUT BY NIPPONDENSO -- TOYOTA'S ALTERNATE VENDOR IN JAPAN. TO MY GREAT SURPRISE THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WAS OF A DIFFERENT DESIGN AND FEEL. WITH THE NIPPONDENSO PEDAL THE FOOTS POSITION ON THE PEDAL IS AT A MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE ANGLE. BUT MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL THE RESPONSE CHARACTERISTICS IS A 100% BETTER THAN THE AMERICAN MADE PEDAL. WITH THE US  MADE PEDAL THE CAR HAD A \"STEP\" RESPONSE WHILST WITH THE NIPPONDENSO PEDAL IT HAS MORE OF A \"RAMP\" RESPONSE. I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER'S SHOP MANAGER THAT THE NIPPONDENSO MADE PEDAL MECHANISM DOES NOT NEED THE SPACER OR THE FLOOR MAT MODIFICATION EITHER. I AM SURPRISED THAT TWO VENDORS MAKING THE SAME PART FOR THE SAME MANUFACTURER TO THE SAME SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS HAVE PRODUCTS THAT ARE SO VASTLY DIFFERENT. THE ONLY THING COMMON BETWEEN THE PEDAL MECHANISMS FROM THE TWO VENDORS IS ITS MOUNTING ON THE FLOOR BOARD. WHERE IS TOYOTA'S QUALITY CONTROL? IN MY OPINION THERE IS A STRONG CO-RELATION BETWEEN UNINTENDED ACCELERATION COMPLAINTS AND THE US MADE ACCELERATOR PEDAL DESIGN AND ITS SHARP \"STEP\" RESPONSE. LET ALL THOSE WHO HAVE A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE UNINTENDED ACCELERATION INSIST ON REPLACING THE PEDAL MECHANISM MADE BY NIPPONDENSO. NHTSA SHOULD LOOK INTO THE VARIATIONS IN THE DESIGN FROM THE TWO VENDORS AND QUESTION AS TO WHY TOYOTA HAS PERMITTED THE VENDORS TO DESIGN THE MECHANISMS RATHER THAN JUST BUILD IT TO TOYOTA'S SPECIFICATIONS. *TR",

I WAS WORRIED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE ENGINE AND THEN THE LIGHTS ON THE AIRCONDITION/HEATING BOARD STOPPED WORKING SO I THOUGHT IT WAS AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM INSTEAD.  I TOOK IT IN.  THE MECHANIC EXPLAINED EVERYTHING AWAY, EXPLAINED THE 'ELECTRICAL PROBLEM', AND STATED THAT THE HEAVING FEELING I WAS SENSING WAS THAT THE CAR WAS COMPUTERIZED AND THAT IT TOOK TIME FOR THE ACCELERATOR TO CATCH UP WITH THE SIGNAL THE COMPUTER WAS GIVING IT, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.  HE RAN AN ENGINE CHECK AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE.  ON MY SERVICE SHEET HE SIMPLY STATED THAT I HAD COMPLAINED ABOUT THE ACCELERATOR HESITATING (WHICH I DID NOT), BUT DID NOT DOCUMENT THAT I BROUGHT THE CAR IN COMPLAINING THAT IT HAD ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS.  A WEEK LATER THERE WAS THE RECALL.  WHEN I LATER CALLED ABOUT THE RECALL AND CONTINUED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE ACCELERATOR PROBLEM, THE SERVICEMAN ( A DIFFERENT ONE) TOLD ME THAT I WOULD FEEL NO CHANGE IN THE WAY THE WAY THE CAR DROVE SO HE WOULD HAVE SOMEONE RIDE WITH ME TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.  THE DAY BEFORE TAKING THE CAR IN FOR THE FIX, THE CAR SLIGHTLY ACCELERATED WHEN I WAS TRYING TO COME TO A STOP.  AFTER THE FIX, A TOYOTA REPRESENTATIVE RODE WITH ME (I LET HIM DRIVE), BUT THE CAR DID APPEAR TO RIDE BETTER AFTER THE FIX.

I WAS DRIVING A RENTED TOYOTA CAMRY IN A PARKING LOT.  I APPLIED THE BRAKE AND INSTEAD OF SLOWING DOWN THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO GAIN SPEED.  I PRESSED HARDER ON THE BRAKE AND IT ACCELERATED.  THE HARDER I TRIED TO STOP THE CAR THE FASTER IT WENT.  I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE FOR A MOMENT AND THE VEHICLE STOPPED ACCELERATING.  I BELIEVE THAT MY FOOT WAS ON BOTH THE BRAKE AND THE ACCELERATOR PEDALS.  I MEASURED THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE BRAKE AND THE ACCELERATOR AND FOUND THAT IT WAS ONLY 1.5 INCHES.  MY VEHICLE A GM ACADIA IS 2.5 INCHES.  THIS MADE ME THINK THAT THE TOPS OF THE TWO PEDALS ARE TOO CLOSE TOGETHER.  I MANAGED TO FIND 6 DIFFERENT TOYOTA MODELS INCLUDING THE PRIUS AND THEY AVERAGED 1.5 INCHES BETWEEN THE TOPS OF THE BRAKE AND THE ACCELERATOR PEDALS.  I MEASURE COMPETITIVE VEHICLES AND FOUND THEY AVERAGED 2.2 INCHES.  SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE TOYOTA DESIGNS ' THEY ARE TOO CLOSE TOGETHER.  I HAVE CONTINUED TO INVESTIGATE UNINTENDED ACCELERATION AND HAVE COLLECTED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DATA THAT SUPPORTS THE FACT THAT THE DRIVER IS A MAJOR CAUSE OF UA AND THAT SOME VEHICLE DESIGNS MAKE IT POSSIBLE.  I HAVE CONDUCTED DRIVING TESTS AND SIMULATED THE CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE UA.  THEY CLEARLY IDENTIFY THAT TOYOTA PEDAL DESIGNS CONTRIBUTE TO THE DRIVER BEING A CAUSE OF UA.  GOOD VEHICLE PEDAL DESIGNS MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SIMULTANEOUSLY AND UNINTENTIONALLY DEPRESS BOTH PEDALS.  FROM THE ODI INCIDENT REPORTS GM VEHICLES SEEM TO BE PARTICULARLY INSENSITIVE WHILE THE FORD 150 TRUCK SEEMS TO HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS.  THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN THE PEDAL DESIGNS OR OPERATION THAT MAKES THIS POSSIBLE.  I HAVE READ TWO OLDER DOT REPORTS CONCERNING UA AND THEY INDICATE THAT THE DRIVER IS A CAUSE OF UA.  WHY IS THAT NOT STUDIED AND ACKNOWLEDGED NOW?  PLEASE FORMALLY INVESTIGATE. *TR",

BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE WITH 2010 CAMRY AND EXPERIENCE OF MANY OTHER 2010 CAMRY OWNERS POSTED ON THE WEB IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THIS PROBLEM CONTINUES TO EXIST.    IN ADDITION TO BEING A DESIGN FLAW IT IS ALSO A SAFETY HAZARD BECAUSE THE CAR DOES NOT REACT NORMALLY WHEN THE DRIVER PRESSES THE ACCELERATOR.

CAR'S HESITATION BEFORE PICKING UP SPEED CAN LEAD DRIVER TO MISJUDGE THE TIME NEEDED TO MERGE INTO TRAFFIC WHICH CAN RESULT IN SERIOUS ACCIDENT.

BELIEVING THAT TOYOTA HAS INACCURATELY ASSIGNED THE CAUSE OF THE UNCONTROLLED ACCELERATION & RESULTANT DEATHS & INJURIES, (NAMELY FAULTY FLOOR MATS AND/OR A STICKING GAS PEDAL SHAFT) WE HAVE NOT DRIVEN OUR 2010 CAMRY FOR MONTHS AS INDICATED BY THE CURRENT 1073 MILES RECORDED ON THE ODOMETER. WE BELIEVE THAT EITHER UNINTENTIONALLY OR BY MANAGEMENT DIRECTIVE TOYOTA IS MISIDENTIFYING THE CAUSE OF THE NUMEROUS TOYOTA ACCIDENTS AND DEATHS. THIS AVOIDANCE TACTIC IS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT ADOPTED BY FORD/FIRESTONE IN THE NUMEROUS YEAR 2000 EXPLORER ROLLOVER ACCIDENTS WHICH ALSO RESULTED IN DEATH AND INJURIES. AFTER FIRST DENYING ANY WRONG-DOING,FORD,(NOT FIRESTONE), ADMITTED TO THE SAFETY HAZARD SUCH THAT WE WERE COMPENSATED BY FORD FOR BOTH OUR 1993 & 2000 EXPLORERS. WITHOUT DOUBT THE EXTENSIVE INVOLVEMENT OF THE NHTSA IN THE EXPLORER ACCIDENTS AND RELATED SAFETY ISSUES WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN MOTIVATING FORD MANAGEMENT INTO DOING WHAT IS RIGHT FOR EXPLORER OWNERS. (I KNOW, BECAUSE WE POSSESSED TWO EXPLORERS THAT BENEFITED FROM FORD'S CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY. AT THIS TIME WITH TOYOTA WE BELIEVE THAT THE SAFETY HAZARD(S) ARE FAR MORE SERIOUS AND THE TOYOTA \"DENIAL STAGE\" IS FAR MORE ENTRENCHED IN THE MINDS OF TOYOTA MANAGEMENT POSSIBLY DUE TO THEIR LONG RECORD OF EXCELLENT SAFETY. HOWEVER, JUST ONE  ACCOUNT OF THE 4 DEATHS ON 8/28/09 IN CALIFORNIA WHEN AN OFF-DUTY HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICER, EXPERIENCED WITH MANY TYPES OF VEHICLES, DROVE FOR SOME 5 MILES AT SPEEDS OF 120MPH WAS SUBJECT TO UNCONTROLLED ACCELERATION IN HIS LEXUS \"LOANER\". TOYOTA'S LOGIC IN BLAMING THE FLOOR MATS REFLECTS TECHNICAL INCOMPETENCE AT BEST AND OUT-OF-CONTROL STUPIDITY AT THE WORST. WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT TOYOTA'S SAFETY RECORD HAS BEEN EXCELLENT IN THE PAST BUT EVEN THE DEITY HAS MADE MISTAKES!!!! *TR",

MY RIGHT FOOT WAS ABOVE THE BRAKE AS I WAS SLOWLY LOOKING FOR A PARKING SPOT.  SUDDENLY, I HEARD A VERY LOUD VVRROOOMMMM AND THE CAR SPONTANEOUSLY ACCELERATED AND  LUNGED FORWARD  APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET.  THANKFULLY, I WAS ABLE TO BRAKE QUICKLY AND STOPPED THE CAR.  I THEN TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP. CONICELLI RAN A DIAGNOSTIC ON MY CAR.  LATER THAT DAY WHEN I PICKED UP THE CAR, THEY SAID THEY FOUND NOTHING.  WHEN I ASKED THEM WHERE THE \"SPONTANEOUS ACCELERATION\" (A PROBLEM TOYOTA EARLIER IN THE DAY TOLD ME THEY WERE HAVING) WOULD HAVE APPEARED ON THE DIAGNOSTIC, THEY WERE AT A LOSS.  LET ME BE VERY CLEAR THAT THERE WAS NOT A FLOOR MAT IN THE DRIVER'S SIDE.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THE \"SPONTANEOUS ACCELERATION\"  WAS CAUSED BY THE \"MAT ISSUE.\"  I KNOW MY EXPERIENCE WAS REAL AND NOT CAUSED BY DRIVER ERROR.  I FEEL THE PROBLEM IS ELSEWHERE AND EXACERBATED FOR SOME DRIVERS BECAUSE THEY HAD THE FLOOR MATS IN PLACE.  PLEASE PRESS TOYOTA TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS ISSUE.
