THE SENSOR IS SUPPOSED TO BE SET TO TURN AIRBAG ON FOR 90 LBS BUT MY WIFE AND KIDS WEIGH ABOUT 120 LBS AND THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP THE AIRBAG SENSOR ON IS TO PULL YOURSELF DOWN IN THE SEAT AND HOLD ON.  I HAVE NOTIFIED SAAB ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THEY CANNOT FIX NOR DO THEY SEEM WILLING TO TRY.  MY WIFE SAT IN OTHER 2008 9-5?S AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AT THE DEALERSHIPS AND THEY WITNESSED THE PROBLEM SO IT IS NOT JUST OUR CAR.  I HOPE SOMEONE AT SAAB/GM WILL TAKE THIS UP AND GET IT FIXED BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED OR HURT DUE TO FAULTY AIRBAGS ON ALL 2008 9-5 MODELS!      THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE SENSOR IS LOCATED SUCH THAT THE WEIGHT OF THE PERSON SITTING IN THE SEAT IS DISTRIBUTED AWAY FROM THE SENSOR AND THE ?REPAIR? NOTED IN THEIR MANUAL DOES NOT WORK.  THEY DO NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM IN THEIR OTHER LINE OF CARS AS THEY HAVE DIFFERENT SENSORS.  THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP NOTIFIED ME THAT THEY KNOW GM ALSO HAS THIS PROBLEM IN THEIR LINE OF VEHICLES WITH THE SAME SENSOR/SEAT PROBE.         I HOPE BY GETTING THIS INFORMATION OUT TO THE PUBLIC, NO ONE WILL BE HURT OR KILLED IN A CRASH INVOLVING A 2008 9-5 SAAB WHEN THE AIRBAG DOES NOT DEPLOY BECAUSE THE PERSON IS LESS THAN 140 LBS AND SITTING IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT.  *TR",
