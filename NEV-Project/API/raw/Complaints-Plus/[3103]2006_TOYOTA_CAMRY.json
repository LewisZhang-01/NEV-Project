        "summary": "I was driving my 2006 Toyota Camry on a level residential road at 35 mph and stopped at a red light. Upon turning left, the car unexpectedly accelerated at a high speed. I stepped on the brakes but the car did not stop nor slow. I was driving towards a very busy intersection. I tried to shift the gear to park, but the car was still running out of control. I turned left onto a side street in order to avoid the intersection. I was going too fast and jumped the curb,  crashed into a Toyota Tundra truck parked on the driveway, and ricocheted into the retaining wall of the neighboring property. I was wearing my set belt, the airbag deployed and hit my chest. There were long tire marks on the street and a witness reported the squealing sound of brakes. Paramedics and police arrived immediately. My blood pressure was checked and I was advised to go to the ER. In the hospital, I was checked for reflexes, stroke and heart problems and got a X-ray of my chest. Everything was ok and I was sent home after 5 hours, although my chest was severely bruised and painful for about 2 weeks. It took me a month to drive again. I kept thinking about what caused the accident. I am certain that mine was a case of sudden unintended acceleration. While there were over 7 million Toyota cars subject to unintended acceleration recalls from 2005-2012, my 2006 Toyota Camry was not included in these recalls.",

I ALREADY CALLED TOYOTA CORPORATE TWICE AND THEY REFUSE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR, ARGUING THAT IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY. I AM AWARE OF THAT, BUT IT IS OBVIOUSLY A MANUFACTURNG PROBLEM. MY CAR IS LOW ON MILEAGE, IT'S NEVER BEEN CRASHED, AND I'VE DONE ALL THE MAINTENANCE AT THE DEALERSHIP IN A TIMELY MANNER SINCE THE DAY I BOUGHT IT. TOYOTA IS WELL AWARE THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THESE ENGINES AND THEY REFUSE TO FIX IT. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY ABOUT $3,000 TO FIX IT, IF THE PROBLEM IS NOT MY FAULT. I'M ALSO NOT GOING TO SELL IT TO SOMEONE WITHOUT TELLING THEM ABOUT THE PROBLEM, BECAUSE THAT'S JUST WRONG. SO MY ONLY OPTIONS ARE PAYING FOR THE REPAIR MYSELF OR SELLING IT AND TAKING A SIGNIFICANT LOSS DUE TO THE PROBLEM.

THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS TIMES IN THE PAST YEAR WHEN THE ENGINE SURGED MOMENTARILY WHEN THE BRAKE WAS APPLIED, BUT IT WAS MOMENTARY, AND NOT THOUGHT SIGNIFICANT. THESE EVENTS OCCURRED WHEN SLOWING TO A STOP OR PARKING. THIS MOST RECENT AND SIGNIFICANT EVENT OCCURRED AFTER A SHORT TRIP, APPROX. 10 MILES. THE CAR HAD BEEN PARKED FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES. WEATHER WAS CLEAR AND TEMPERATURE IN THE 70'S. IT IS A 4 CYLINDER CAMRY, 2006 WITH ABOUT 155K MILES. THE CAR HAS NOT HAD ANY MODIFICATIONS OR MAJOR REPAIRS.  *TR",

WHEN I TEST DROVE IT, I NOTICED THE AIRBAG LIGHT WAS ON.   I EXPRESSED CONCERN TO THE SALESMAN WHO INDICATED \"OH, THAT'S JUST A SENSOR ISSUE, THAT CAN BE FIXED QUICKLY.\" I PURCHASED THE CAR WITH SOME RESERVATION ABOUT THE LIGHT.  WHEN I PICKED UP THE CAR, THE LIGHT WAS OFF (THEY HAD TAKEN IT TO THE LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP TO FIX).  EVERYTHING WAS FINE FOR ABOUT 5 MONTHS IN AUGUST WHEN THE LIGHT CAME BACK ON AGAIN.  I RETURNED IT TO MAPLE HILL AUTO AND WAS TOLD BY THE SALESMAN THAT \"THE AIRBAG LIGHT WAS NOT PART OF POWERTRAIN WARRANTY AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT BE FIXED.  I THEN TOOK IT TO THE TOYOTA DEALER WHO INFORMED ME THAT THEY COULD \"TWEAK\"IT AGAIN BUT IN EVIDENTLY THE ENTIRE FRONT SEAT MAY HAVE TO BE REMOVED AT A COST OF ABOUT $3000, WHICH OF COURSE I DON'T HAVE.  SO THEY \"TWEAKED\" IT AGAIN AND IT WAS OKAY FOR A WHILE.  NOW, JULY 2012, IT HAS COME BACK ON AGAIN.  ON MY SALES AGREEMENT WITH MAPLE HILL AUTO IT STATES \"DEALER WILL REPAIR AIR BAG LIGHT ISSUE.\"  OBVIOUSLY, THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED.  THE CAR ONLY HAD 49,000 MILES ON IT WHEN THE LIGHT WAS ON ORIGINALLY.  THE ORIGINAL WARRANTY FOR CAMRYS IS SUPPOSED TO BE 60,0000 MILES FOR THIS ISSUE.  I FEEL THAT I HAVE BEEN SCAMMED AND LIED TO BY THE DEALER WHO ONLY TOOK IT TO TOYOTA TO GET THE LIGHT TEMPORARILY OFF SO I WOULD BUY THE CAR.  I BELIEVE THEY KNEW IT WAS A MORE SERIOUS ISSUE BECAUSE I BELIEVE TOYOTA TOLD THEM IT WOULD BE A RECURRING PROBLEM.  NOW I FEEL STUCK AS I CANNOT AFFORD TO REPLACE A SEAT AND I DON'T FEEL A 2006 CAMRY I PAID $12,350 FOR SHOULD HAVE THIS ISSUE.  AREN'T THEY SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT SAFETY?

IT APPEARS THAT THE WIRING FOR THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM IS IN THE WHEEL WELLS AND VULNERABLE TO MAJOR DAMAGE WITH A MINOR IMPACT. A BETTER PROTECTION OF THE WIRING NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

I WROTE A LETTER TO TOYOTA ASKING IF THE RUBBER BUSHING ON THE NEW REPLACEMENT CONTROL ARMS I PURCHASED IS THE SAME POOR QUALITY AS THE ORIGINALS.  ALSO, ARE THE NEW 2012 CAMRY'S EQUIPPED WITH SAME SHOCK CONTROL ARM BUSHINGS?  I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM TOYOTA IN TORRANCE, CA DATED 12/12/11 SAYING THEY \"REVIEWED AND DOCUMENTED\" MY LETTER.

DO NOT BUY ANY TOYOTA CAR WITHOUT FIRST PERSONALLY INSPECTING THE CONDITION OF BOTH CONTROL ARM BUSHINGS TOGETHER WITH THE MECHANIC HOLDING A FLASHLIGHT AND MIRROR, AT EVERY OIL CHANGE.  MAKE THE SAME INSPECTION BEFORE THE 36,000/3 YEAR WARRANTY OR 1 YEAR WARRANTY ON REPLACEMENTS, EXPIRE!  ANY INCIPIENT TEAR IS REASON FOR REPLACEMENT AT TOYOTA'S COST.

AS I PUSHED ON THE BRAKE TO PARK, IT WENT TO THE FLOOR, AND MY ENGINE SURGED LOUDLY, HITTING THE PARKED CAR IN FRONT OF ME ABOUT 9-12 FEET OUT OF IT'S SPACE.  I FRANTICALLY TURNED MY STEERING WHEEL TO MY LEFT, JUMPED A CURB, WENT THROUGH A FEW BUSHES AND HIT A TREE WHICH STOPPED MY CAR.  I TURNED MY KEY OFF, PLACED IT IN PARK AND THREW MY KEYS ON TO THE PASSENGER SEAT.  THIS CAR CAUSED THE CRASH.  I HAVE NEVER FELT ANYTHING SO STRANGE AS I COULD NOT STOP THIS CAR WITH THE BRAKE.  IT HAPPENED IN ONLY ABOUT 4 SECONDS.  I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALER, AS I DIDN'T WANT TO DRIVE IT.  I FEEL IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE UNTIL IT IS FIXED BY TOYOTA.  I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH MY CAR EXCEPT SOME HESITATION IN MOVING FAST INTO TRAFFIC.  TOYOTA SENT AN INSPECTOR TO THE DEALERSHIP TO CHECK OUT THE CAR ON 8/17/10.  I CALLED TO SEE WHAT THE RESULTS WERE AND THEY SENT A MESSAGE BY A SECRETARY THAT NOTHING WAS ABNORMAL AND IT WAS SAFE TO DRIVE.  THIS CAR IS NOT SAFE.  I WILL NOT ALLOW MY INSURANCE TO PAY FOR THE PHYSICAL DAMAGE UNTIL TOYOTA FIXES THE BRAKE/ACCELERATION PROBLEM.  I AM LUCKY THAT I, OR SOMEONE ELSE DIDN'T GET KILLED OR HURT.  NEXT TIME IT COULD BE DIFFERENT. THIS CRASH WAS NOT MY FAULT!  IF ALL THE OTHER CARS HAD THESE PROBLEMS, WHY DO THEY FEEL THE SOLARA ISN'T INCLUDED?  MAYBE, THIS IS THE FIRST OF MANY SOLARA'S.  I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT TOYOTA DOESN'T RESPOND TO CUSTOMER'S BETTER.  ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS FIX IT AND IT'S OVER.  I'M NOT SO CONFIDENT IN ANY OF THEIR PRODUCTS AS OF NOW.

THE RPM GO WAY DOWN AS THE CAR SLOWS (BY BACKING OFF THE GAS PEDAL - NO BRAKES APPLIED) TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION.  ONCE THE TURN IS COMPLETED, OR THE TRAFFIC IN FRONT STARTS TO PULL AHEAD AGAIN, THE CAR DOES NOT RESPOND TO APPLYING THE ACCELERATOR. IT CAN TAKE FROM A HALF SECOND TO TWO FULL SECONDS BEFORE THE CAR \"RECOGNIZES\" THAT IT IS BEING TOLD TO SPEED UP - FOR IT TO GIVE MORE RPM AND TO PICK THE RIGHT GEAR TO DO IT IN. IT SEEMS TO BE TRYING TO MAKE UP ITS MIND WHICH GEAR TO USE BEFORE IT ADDS ENOUGH RPM TO ACCELERATE.  IT'S LIKE THE RPM WENT DOWN SO LOW WHEN BACKING OFF THE GAS PEDAL THAT THE CAR DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN IT'S TOLD TO GET BACK TO WORK. WHEN IT FINALLY RESPONDS, THE ENGINE USUALLY KICKS DOWN ONE OR TWO GEARS AND STARTS RACING TO CATCH UP - LIKE THE DRIVER HAS FLOORED IT, WITHOUT HAVING FLOORED IT.

THIS IS WHY I AM REPORTING THIS PROBLEM.  THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE SURFACED AND ADDRESSED. I AM SURE THAT THERE ARE OTHER TOYOTA CAMRY OWNERS THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM THE SAME PROBLEM AS WE ARE.   I HAVE TODAY CONTACTED TOYOTA CORPORATION HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE COMPANY HAS NOT ADDRESSED MY CONCERN OR EVEN ACKNOWLEDGES RECEIVING MY COMPLAINT.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT I WANT THIS PROBLEMS FIXED.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION.     [XXX] *TR",

MY COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN THAT THE BRAKE PEDAL DROPS TO THE FLOOR AND THEN THE CAR ACCELERATES FORWARD AND THAT THE CAR ACCELERATES ON ITS OWN. THE SERVICE WRITERS HAVE DISMISSED MY COMPLAINTS AND GIVEN MANY EXCUSES SUCH AS: WHEN I LEFT THE CAR THERE TO HAVE THEM CHECK OUT THE PROBLEM THEY SAID THAT THE PROBLEM COULD NOT BE REPEATED SO THE CAR WAS FINE, ANOTHER TIME I WAS TOLD THAT THE NEW CARS HAVE ABS BRAKES THAT DROP DOWN TO THE FLOOR, AND AT A DIFFERENT TIME THEY SAID THAT WITH THESE NEW CARS THE REAR BRAKES HAD TO BE ADJUSTED AT EVERY OIL CHANGE AND ETC.   THERE WAS AN INCIDENT IN 2006 WHEN I WAS AT A STOP AND SOME PEDESTRIANS WERE WALKING ACROSS THE STREET. THE CAR DID STOP BUT ALL OF THE SUDDEN THE BRAKE PEDAL HIT THE FLOOR AND THE CAR STARTED TO MOVE FORWARD. I HAD TO PUMP THE BRAKE PEDAL A FEW TIMES IN ORDER FOR IT WORK AGAIN. THANKFULLY THE PEDESTRIANS HAD NOT PASSED INFRONT OF MY CAR YET. I DON'T REMEMBER THE SPECIFIC DATE BUT I DO KNOW IT WAS IN 2006.  ON 2/20/2010 I HAD MY HUSBAND TAKE THE CAR TO GET AN OIL CHANGE AT CLAREMONT TOYOTA. I HAD MY HUSBAND TAKE THE CAR BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO LIED TO OR GIVEN ANOTHER EXCUSE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT CARS. MY HUSBAND MENTIONED THE PROBLEM ABOUT THE BRAKE PEDAL GOING DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND SOMETIMES HAVING TO DOWNSHIFT OR USE THE PARKING BRAKE TO SLOW DOWN THE CAR AND WAS TOLD THAT THIS CONDITION EXISTS DUE TO THE ABS SYSTEM SENSING THE ROTATION OF THE TIRES AND THAT THE CAR WOULD EVENTUALLY STOP. MY HUSBAND THEN MENTIONED WHAT WE HAD BEEN TOLD ABOUT THE REAR BRAKES AND THE SERVICE WRITER GRINNED AND SAID THAT THE BRAKES DO NOT NEED ADJUSTMENT.

ON THE FIRST MAJOR ACCIDENT, MY WIFE WHO WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE, TRIED TO STOP THE VEHICLE AT THE SIGNAL, INSTEAD IT RACED FORWARD  ON ITS OWN AND HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE. ON THE SECOND MAJOR INCIDENT, AFTER STOPPING THE CAR AND ALLOWING ANOTHER CAR TO PASS ON THE SAME ROAD IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, SHE MADE A LEFT TURN AND THE CAR ACCELERATED UNCONTROLLABLY AND HIT A BIG TREE STANDING AT AN ELEVATED PART OF THE ROAD. BY LOOKING AT THE SCENE ANYBODY CAN COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT SOME KIND OF MALFUNCTIONING OF THE ACCELERATION MECHANISM HAS HAPPENED. IN BOTH OF THESE MAJOR ACCIDENTS, NONE OF THE AIR-BAGS DEPLOYED. THE SAME CAR HAD ANOTHER SIMILAR INCIDENT BUT NO PROPERTY WAS DAMAGED AND THEREFORE, THAT INCIDENT WAS NOT REPORTED TO POLICE BUT A CO-WORKER DROVE THE VEHICLE OUT OF THE RETAINING POND. IN THIS INCIDENT, MY WIFE AFTER PARKING THE CAR, TRIED TO PULL IT A LITTLE FURTHER AND THEN THE CAR JUMPED ACROSS THE CONCRETE BUMP AND FELL INTO THE RETAINING POND. LUCKLY THERE WAS NO WATER. *TR",

ANOTHER GAS STATION ATTENDANT SAID THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM ON MANY LATE MODEL CAMRYS (HIS STATION IS DOWN THE BLOCK FROM A DEALER SO HE SAYS HE HAS SEEN A FEW OF THESE), CAUSED WHEN THE TANK IS OVERFILLED AND FLOODING GAS INTO THE CANISTER, RUINING IT, AND ULTIMATELY CAUSING THE FILL-UP PROBLEMS DESCRIBED ABOVE. ITS SCHEDULED TO BE FIXED TOMORROW, BUT WONDERING IF THIS IS A DESIGN/PRODUCT DEFECT, THAT WILL REOCCUR IN THE FUTURE (ESP AFTER THE WARRANTY ENDS.)   PLEASE DO NOT ADVISE TO NOT OVERFILL THE TANK, FOR 2 REASONS: 1) I LIVE IN NJ, WHERE ONLY STATION ATTENDANTS ARE LEGALLY ALLOWED TO FILL THE TANK, SO I HAVE LITTLE/NO CONTROL OVER IT.  2) THIS SHOULD NOT EVER BE A PROBLEM, IN GENERAL, EVEN IF THE TANK IS OVERFILLED AND GAS GUSHES ONTO THE GROUND.

AFTER RECEIVING A NEW CAR, I HAD HEARD SOME KIND OF NOISE WHEN I DROVE THE CAR FOR THE FIRST TIME. AT THAT POINT, I KNEW THAT THIS KIND OF NOISE WAS NORMAL BECAUSE MY CAR WAS BRAND NEW. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT NOISE HAD GOT LOUDER TIME AFTER TIME, AND DID NOT STOP.   TO FIX A NOISE PROBLEM ON MY CAR, I CHECKED MY CAR TO TOYOTA. TOYOTA FOUND THE PROBLEM AND TOLD ME THAT MY CAR NEEDED TO REPLACE A WHOLE TRANSMISSION. AT THAT TIME, I COULD NOT BELIEVE THE FACT THAT MY NEW CAR NEEDED TO FIX, BECAUSE MY CAR HAD GOT JUST 500 MILEAGE ON IT AND JUST PASSED TWO WEEKS AFTER PURCHASING MY CAR.   FURTHERMORE, I FELT DISPLEASURE AND WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES' ATTITUDE. I WANTED TO TRADE IN MY CAR WITH A NEW ANOTHER CAMRY.   THEY REQUIRED ME TO PAY FOR 7000 DOLLAR MORE WITH MY OLD CAR. I HAD BEEN WAITED FOR MORE ONE HOUR TO MAKE DEAL WITH ONE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES. AT THAT TIME, I HAD FELT SOME KIND OF DISCRIMINATION.  EVEN WORSE, THIS THURSDAY, I ALSO HAVE HEARD SAME NOISE AGAIN. TO CHECK THE NOISE, I DROPPED OFF MY CAR AGAIN TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP SERVICE. TOYOTA TOLD ME THAT MY CAR HAD ANOTHER PROBLEM ON STEERING SHAPE AT THIS TIME. I LET HIM REPAIR IT AGAIN.  UNTIL THIS VERY DAY, EVEN THOUGH MY CAR WAS CHECKED TWICE AT THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE, I CAN HEAR THE SAME NOISE AGAIN.  I'VE KNOWN THAT THE QUALITY OF TOYOTA IS VERY GOOD AND TRUSTED THE SERVICE.  FOR NOW, I AM SO DOUBT ABOUT THE TOYOTA AND THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE. IT SEEMS THE TECHNICIANS ARE NOT TRAINED TO BE PROFESSIONAL TO REPAIR TOYOTA CARS OR THEY DID NOT TRY TO CHECK MY CAR.  I AM WONDERING IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER WAYS TO CHANGE MY CAR.   LIKE I MENTIONED ABOUT MY CAR, I WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE IT TO THE ANOTHER NEW CAR, IF POSSIBLE.

I DON'T KNOW HOW TO CONTACT THE NEW OWNER. I THOUGHT THE DEALER   WOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND SEND THE CAR BACK TO THE FACTORY TO BE FIXED.  *NM  SEE ODI 10155560 ALSO.  *DSY",
