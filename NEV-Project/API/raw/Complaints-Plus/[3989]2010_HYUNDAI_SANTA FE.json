        "summary": "On April 22,2021 I took my Hyundai Santa Fe to McGrath Hyundai Serv Ctr for routine oil change. I paid for this oil chge and was given a MultiPoint Inspection rpt detailing my car was in good condition needing only routine maintenance updates. Mileage was documented 46,008 mi. My car was in excellent condition, regularly maintained at Hyundai service centers. 9 days later my engine failed without any warning. I had only driven about 30 mi after service.This is a safety issue as the failure could've occurred while I was driving. I towed the car back to the serv ctr where I was told I would need a new engine.  There was no reason ever given for the sudden failure other than that this was a bad engine. I called Hyundai Corp Care to ask for help. I was told my 100,000/10yr warranty had expired 6 mos. earlier and there was NO recall.  I later found this not to be true as NHTSA had done an investigation earlier causing Hyundai to recall 1000's of Santa Fe's for the EXACT reason that my engine failed.  My VIN is not included in this recall but the problem was exactly the same. I read in the NHTSA report this recall applied to engines manufactured before 2011. After many phone calls/emails, Hyundai Corp agreed to a \"good will\" offer to replace the engine for 80%.  I was told they would remove the bad engine and drop in a new one. However, there was faulty communication between Hyundai Corp and Hyundai service center. My hands were tied. 175 days later I was returned my car with a remanufactured short block. Approximately 2 mos later my oil light began to flicker.  I returned to serv ctr where I was told I  now need to manually check my oil regularly. The service engine light no longer works as it should. The warning light no longer works for other safety issues also.  Hyundai was not truthful in owning up to the existence of the engine safety issue. They should have owned my problem and repaired as part of the recall. I no longer feel safe driving my car.",

TWO SHOCKS WERE LEAKING SO I HAD THE STRUTS (FRONT) AND SHOCKS (REAR) REPLACED ALONG WITH THE END LINKS. ON A TEST DRIVE IT WAS STILL MAKING A CLUNKING NOISE SO I RESEARCH THE HYUNDAI FORUMS FOR POSSIBLE CAUSES. THERE WERE FOUR POSSIBLE CAUSES, ONE WHICH HAD BEEN CORRECTED, THE END LINKS, THE LOWER CONTROL ROD, THE CONNECTION MOUNTS BETWEEN THE FRAME AND THE BODY, AND THE FRONT AND REAR ENGINE MOUNTS. UPON INSPECTING THE ENGINE MOUNTS I FOUND THE FRONT ENGINE MOUNTS BOLT, A 12MM X 5 INCH BOLT, MISSING. APPARENTLY WHEN THE CAR WAS ENGINEERED THE BOLT WASN'T SECURED WITH A LOCKING NUT OR COTTER PIN SO WHEN THE NUT LOOSENED AND VIBRATED OFF THE BOLT, THE BOLT ALSO VIBRATED OUT OF THE MOUNT. I ACTUALLY REMEMBER WHEN THIS OCCURRED, AT AROUND 50,000 MILES. I REMEMBER A LOUD BANG UNDER THE CAR AND IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR I SAW A BOLT TUMBLING DOWN THE HIGHWAY. I THOUGHT I HAD RUN OVER IT WITH A WHEEL. I TOOK THE CAR INTO THE HYUNDAI DEALER AT 56,652 MILES FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND \"12-POINT INSPECTION\" AND \"MULTI-POINT INSPECTION\" AND THE MECHANIC DIDN'T DISCOVER THE MISSING FRONT ENGINE MOUNT BOLT. (I FOUND IT MYSELF WHEN I TOOK THE CAR TO A LOCAL CAR SHOP FOR THE STRUT AND SHOCK REPLACEMENT.) I THEN WENT TO THE HYUNDAI DEALER AND TOLD THEM WHAT I DISCOVERED. THE PART NUMBER FOR THE BOLT IS 21920-2B000, AND THE PART NUMBER FOR THE NUT IS 13396-12007K. THERE WAS NO DESCRIPTION AS TO THE SIZE OF THE BOLT, THE THREAD OF THE BOLT AND NUT, NOR WHETHER THE NUT WAS A LOCKING NUT.

THERE ARE AT LEAST 2 AND POSSIBLY MORE TSB'S THAT APPEAR TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM (TSB-10-AT-006, 12-AT-012, 12-AT-009-2). I WILL ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AGAIN WITH THE DEALER ASKING HIM TO REVIEW THESE SPECIFIC TSB'S. AFTER SO MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT A VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEM TO A VITAL DRIVETRAIN COMPONENT, IT IS TIME FOR HYUNDAI TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THIS PROBLEM AND FIX IT!  THE CONSUMER SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH SO MUCH HASSLE FOR A WIDELY KNOWN ISSUE. HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND DON'T TAKE THE TIME TO REPORT IT?",

TRAVELING NORTH ON RTE I-95, MY HUSBAND DROVE ABOUT 300 MILES AND THAN I DROVE ANOTHER 300 MILES, STOPPING TO EAT AND AT VARIOUS REST AREAS. JUST BEFORE THE VIRGINIA BORDER, WE STOPPED AT A REST AREA AND MY HUSBAND TOOK OVER DRIVING. HE SAID WE SHOULD STOP FOR GAS AND A BIT TO EAT. WE WENT OVER THE STATE LINE AND GOT OFF AT EXIT 4, WE EXIT, STOPPED AT THE STOP SIGN, TURNED RIGHT TO GO INTO THE STATION AND WE HEARD A LOUD SNAP. AT THIS POINT, THE  ONLY WAY HE COULD STOP THE CAR WAS TO PUT ON THE EMERGENCY BRAKE THERE WAS NO CONTROL OF THE CAR.  AFTER BEING TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP, WE WERE TOLD THAT POSSIBLY THE DRIVESHAFT SNAPPED AND THE TRANSMISSION ALSO WENT. THE MECHANIC THERE SAID THAT THIS IS THE THIRD ONE HE HAD SEEN LIKE THAT. THE NEXT DAY WE WERE TOLD THAT IN FACT THAT IS WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  LUCKILY, WE HAD GOTTEN OFF WHEN WE DID, OR ELSE WE MAY HAVE BEEN IN A MAJOR CRASH ON BUSY RTE I-95 OR MAY EVEN HAD BEEN KILLED BECAUSE OF NO CONTROL OF THE CAR. THIS IS  2010 CAR WITH ONLY 17,700 MILES ON IT. TODAY, WE FOUND OUT THAT HYUNDAI KNEW OF THE PROBLEM AND THAT THE DEALERS HAVE RECEIVED A BULLETIN ABOUT THIS. WE WERE NOT TOLD OF THIS DANGEROUS DEFECT AND NOW DO NOT KNOW IF THIS HAS BEEN CORRECTED PROPERLY. WE ARE SUPPOSED TO PICK UP THE CAR IN VIRGINIA BY THE END OF THE WEEK.
