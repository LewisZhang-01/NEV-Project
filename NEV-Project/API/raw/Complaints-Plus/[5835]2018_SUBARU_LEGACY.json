I'VE BEEN WITH NEW CAR DEALERSHIP FOR OVER 30YEARS AND OWNED MANY CARS AND NEVER HAD A WINDSHIELD CRACK SO EASILY. SMALL ROCKS WOULD HIT MY OTHER CARS AND JUST BOUNCE OFF, BUT NOT MY 2018 SUBARU LEGACY, AS I SAID AT \"LEAST\" 6 MARKS FROM ANYTHING HITTING MY WINDSHIELD IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO SEE, YET NO MARKS ON MY OTHER VEHICLE, WHICH IS A GM PRODUCT. TAKING A PICTURE IS TOO HARD TO SEE \"ALL\" THE SMALL CHIPS. I HAVEN'T REPLACED IT YET, HOPING A RECALL WOULD HAPPEN, OR SOMEONE WANTS TO LOOK AT ALL THE NICKS, SINCE I'VE OWNED IT NEW FROM 2018.

SAFETY WAS THE NUMBER ONE REASON WHY I CHOSE THIS CAR (BACKUP CAMERA, LANE DEPARTURE ASSIST, ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL).

ADDITIONALLY, WITH NO BLUETOOTH PHONE CONNECTION AVAILABLE, I AM FORCED TO HOLD MY PHONE WHILE DRIVING, TAKING ONE OF MY HANDS OFF THE WHEEL, AND DISTRACTING ME FROM FOCUSING ON DRIVING. IT'S ABSURD TO ME THAT THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN RAISED BY HUNDREDS OF SUBARU OWNERS ACROSS MULTIPLE MODEL VEHICLES, AND IT HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED.

        "summary": "OUR RECENT PURCHASE OF A 2018 SUBARU LEGACY HAS LEFT US WITH A VERY UNHAPPY REALIZATION. WE HAVE A SUBARU OUTBACK AND LIKE THE CAR BUT VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE CRUISE. WE DID NOT REALIZE THE CRUISE CONTROL ADVANCES 1 OR 5 MPH RATHER THAN THE CONVENTIONAL CRUISE OF 1 MPH. WE HAVE FOUND THIS FEATURE TO BE NOT ONLY ON SUBARU BUT MANY OTHER MAKES OF VEHICLES. FROM RESEARCHING ONLINE AND TALKING TO OTHERS HAVE FOUND WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT DO NOT LIKE IT AND FEEL IT IS UNSAFE. THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A REASON TO ADVANCE 5 MPH RATHER THAN 1 MPH. WHEN USING THIS TYPE OF CRUISE IT IS NECESSARY TO WATCH THE SPEEDOMETER, RATHER THAN PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ROAD, TO GET TO THE ANTICIPATED SPEED AND THEN QUICKLY SET AND HOPE YOU LOCKED-IN THE DESIRED SPEED. IF THE DESIRED SPEED IS NOT REACHED THE FIRST TIME THEN IT IS PUSHING THE CRUISE AND HOLDING IT, HOPING THAT IT ONLY ADVANCED 1 MPH RATHER THAN 5 MPH, OTHERWISE IT IS CANCELING AND TRYING AGAIN.   WE CONTACTED SUBARU ABOUT THIS AND WERE TOLD THAT IF THERE ARE ENOUGH COMPLAINTS THEY WOULD CONSIDER A SOFTWARE UPDATE. IT WAS ALSO EXPLAINED THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IF WE WERE TOLD THIS BEFORE THE PURCHASE OF THE CAR.   WE LOOKED AT THE WEBSITES FOR THE SAFEST VEHICLES AND SUBARU IS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST BUT THIS TYPE OF CRUISE CONTROL TAKES AWAY THE SAFETY; EVERYONE IS PREACHING TO REDUCE DISTRACTIONS WHEN DRIVING BUT TAKING AWAY THE CONVENTIONAL CRUISE CONTROL AND IMPLEMENTING SUCH A DISTRACTION DEFEATS THE PURPOSE.  WE HOPE THIS COMPLAINT LEADS BACK TO VEHICLES HAVING CONVENTIONAL CRUISE CONTROL AS THE STANDARD EQUIPMENT.",
