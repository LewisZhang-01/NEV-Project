I reversed the car and returned to my driveway. My husband called a friend mechanic shop owner who ran the diagnostic report that showed a C1391code.  I remembered I received a notification letter regarding this issue and called the dealer. Service agent indicated that without Toyota doing the diagnostic run on my vehicle, they could not give me any quote on the price, but notified me that the letter I received had expired on December 31, 2020 or 10 years or 150,000 miles.  My Highlander had this alert screen notification at 144,000 miles. I was told I would be responsible for repair charges.  Feeling very frustrated, I called the Toyota corporate number and spoke to a female who then connected me with a supervisor. I explained my experience and the representative explained the notification letter had expired and was unlike a recall, which was indefinite. I emphasized to him that since Toyota knew this was a problem, how could they put an expiration date on the failed Brake Booster Actuator Pump Assembly  that they clearly knew was a brake problem. Furthermore, Toyota, which I have been a loyal owner of five vehicles, had only allowed one year +  for their accountability to the fixing the brake assembly parts. This meant it was a luck of the draw depending on miles driven for the brake assembly to fail during the little more than a year notification period for Toyota to be responsible for replacing the parts. I find this to be very unfair and unjust.  I voiced my opinion to the 800 number a second time, & was told that if the NHTSA had determined it a recall, no expiration date.  As a senior citizen who is on a fixed income,  I believe Toyota should fix all Brake Booster Actuator Pumps that fail and NHTSA should demand a recall.",

I did not see the error code again until now (after 1 year). I received a Customer Support Program Bulletin letter (POL19-06) from Toyota in 2019 or early 2020 which mentioned C1391 as a verification of problem in vehicle. I showed it to the dealership during my 2020 visit and they said my vehicle is not covered. I believed them since I did not see the error again after replacing the 12V battery. Now I am having the same problem again. The ABS error was displayed on 11/26/2021. I was able to read and reset the ABS error code C1391 on 11/30/2021.

MY CAR THREW THE DEATH CODE [C1391] WHICH IS THE INDICATION THAT THIS IS THE ISSUE. THE SCREEN INSIDE THE CAR FLASHED ABS // VSC // CHECK BRAKE SYSTEM. THE CAR WAS PURCHASED NEW FROM A DEALERSHIP AND HAS BEEN IN THE FAMILY EVER SINCE. THE \"RECALL\" ON THE ACTUATOR IS NOT ACTUALLY A RECALL, IT IS A \"WARRANTY EXTENSION.\"AFTER RECEIVING A QUOTE FOR REPLACEMENT OF $4200CAD, I CONTACTED TOYOTA ABOUT MY ISSUE.     MY HIGHLANDER HAS 184,XXXMI AND IS A 2008 SO IT IS BEYOND THE MILAGE OF THE EXTENDED WARRANTY (150,000MI) AND BEYOND THE END DATE OF THE INFINITY MILEAGE REPLACEMENT (NEW WARRANTY ENDED DEC 2020, OF COURSE). I CALLED TOYOTA, MADE A CLAIM, AND 24HRS LATER I CALLED BACK IN AND WAS DIRECTED TO SPEAK WITH THE WARRANTY DEPARTMENT MANAGER. ALTHOUGH MY APPROACH WAS DIRECT, THOROUGH, AND CALM, HE REALLY DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE. HE DEFENDED TOYOTA STATING THAT THEY \"ALREADY WERE BEING VERY GRACIOUS BY EXTENDING THE CLAIM TO BEGIN WITH\" AND THAT \"THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO.\"    I FIND THE FACT THAT TOYOTA RECOGNIZES THEY HAVE USED A FAULTY PART IN THEIR HIGHLANDERS, AND DID NOT LIST IT AS A \"RECALL\" (SO YOU COULD GET IT SWAPPED OUT BEFORE IT CAUSED PROBLEMS) IS RIDICULOUS.

THERE ARE NUMEROUS CASES THAT HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED ONLINE OF BRAKE FAILURE ON THIS VEHICLE AS A RESULT OF THE MALFUNCTIONS OF THE BRAKE ACTUATOR AND BOOSTER PUMP SOME WITH CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES.  NO ONE AT TOYOTA HAS BEEN ABLE TO EXPLAIN WHY REPAIRS ARE NOT COVERED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2020 AND INDICATE THAT IT WAS APPARENTLY AN ARBITRARY DATE.  MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT THIS WAS A DELIBERATE EFFORT BY TOYOTA TO LIMIT THEIR FINANCIAL EXPOSURE WITH NO REGARD FOR THE SAFETY OF DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS.

TOYOTA HAS SET A LIMIT OF EXTENDED LIMITED WARRANTY (LCS-ZE2) TO FIX THIS DEFECT BUT ONLY IF IT OCCURS AT < (OR EQUAL) 10 YRS OR 150,000 MILES.  MANY REPORTS ON THE WEB INDICATE CARS PAST THE TOYOTA ARBITRARY CUT OFFS FOR TIME AND MILES.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY DEFECT/RISK BECAUSE ALL OF THE OIL COULD LEAK OUT FROM A DEFECTIVE PIPE &  ENGINE COULD CATCH FIRE OR FREEZE. I HAD SMOKE IN THE CABIN AND A LOW OIL PRESSURE WARNING LIGHT. OF  NOTE, MY CAR WAS SERVICED (OIL CHANGE) AND A MULTIPOINT INSPECTION BY TOYOTA 3 WEEKS PRIOR TO OIL LEAK (IN JAN 2020) AND THE OIL LEAK WAS NOT NOTED. THIS  MEANS THAT THE LEAK OCCURRED RECENTLY AND WELL PAST THE ARBITRARY TIME INTERVAL/MILEAGE LIMIT SET BY TOYOTA.   AT NO TIME DID MY TOYOTA DEALER NOTIFY ME REGARDING THE EXTENDED WARRANTY ENHANCEMENT OR THAT THIS COULD E A PROBLEM OR NOR DID MY TOYOTA DEALER SPECIFICALLY LOOK FOR THIS PROBLEM ON MY CAR DURING INSPECTION.

CONSEQUENCE:  IF THE FFC IS DAMAGED, CONNECTIVITY TO THE DRIVER'S AIR BAG MODULE COULD BE LOST AND THE AIR BAG DEACTIVATED.  2 YRS AGO OUR '08 HIGHLANDER SPORT THE CRUISE CONTROL STARTED ACTING ERRATICALLY, NOT ENGAGING/NOT TURN/OFF USING THE COLUMN MOUNTED STALK.

THE SERVICE ADVISOR STATED THAT IF THE ISSUE IS LEFT UNADDRESSED, IT COULD LEAD TO COMPLETE ENGINE FAILURE. HE ALSO STATED THAT THE UPDATED CAM GEAR MADE BY TOYOTA DOES NOT FIT THE EXISTING CAMSHAFT. THIS MEANS THAT ALL 4 CAM GEARS AND TWO CAMSHAFTS WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED WHICH DRAMATICALLY INCREASES THE LABOR AND PARTS COSTS. I WAS GIVEN THE FOLLOWING QUOTE FOR THE REPAIR: PART'S $3748.00  LABOR $2137.00  TAX $348.00  TOTAL $6233.00  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO ANOTHER TOYOTA TO CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS AND THEY CONFIRMED THE ISSUE AND QUOTED ME AT A SIMILAR PRICE TO DO THE REPAIR. MESSAGE BOARDS ALL ACROSS THE INTERNET DESCRIBE A SIMILAR PHENOMENON. AFTER DISCUSSING THE MATTER WITH TOYOTA CORPORATE, THEY AGREED TO COVER 50% OF THE PARTS COST, BUT I BELIEVE THIS TO BE UNFAIR BECAUSE THEIR UPDATED PART INTRINSICALLY AND DRAMATICALLY INCREASES THE LABOR AND PARTS COSTS. EVEN THOUGH ONLY ONE CAM GEAR FAILED, THE REPLACEMENT OF ALL 4 CAM GEARS IS NOW NECESSARY.",

EVERY MECHANIC I HAVE SPOKEN WITH HAVE INDICATED THAT A VALVE SPRING SHOULD NOT BREAK ON A 2008 TOYOTA WITH AROUND 100K MILES. I SEARCHED ONLINE AND FOUND THAT TOYOTA HAS RECALLED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CERTAIN LEXUS MODELS, INCLUDING MODELS FROM 2008 WITH THE SAME 3.5 LITER V6 ENGINE AS IS IN MY HIGHLANDER, FOR FAULTY VALVE SPRINGS THAT RESULT IN SUDDEN ENGINE STALLING. RICE TOYOTA HAS REFUSED TO PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE, AS HAS TOYOTA CORPORATION. FURTHER, TOYOTA CORPORATION HAS REFUSED TO PROVIDE ME WITH ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THE MANUFACTURER OF THE VALVE SPRING IN MY VEHICLE AND/OR ANY INDICATION IF THE SAME VALVE SPRING WAS IN THE RECALLED LEXUS MODES.

AFTER STOPPING THE CAR & WAITING FOR THE SMOKE TO DISSIPATE,HE CHECKED & FOUND THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY OIL IN THE ENGINE, THE OIL HAD EMPTIED FROM THE ENGINE THE LAST FEW MILES WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY. I ARRIVED LATER THAT MORNING TO INVESTIGATE, TO DISCOVER THAT THE OIL WAS BELOW THE DIPSTICK. THE BOTTOM OF THE ENGINE & ENTIRE UNDERSIDE OF THE VEHICLE, INCLUDING THE EXHAUST SYSTEM, SPARE TIRE, WHEEL WELLS, RIGHT WHEELS & TIRES & REAR LIFTGATE WERE COATED IN ENGINE OIL. THE SMOKE APPARENTLY WAS FROM OIL SPLASHING ONTO THE HOT EXHAUST SYSTEM, & VAPORIZING DUE TO THE HIGH TEMP, CREATING A POTENTIAL FIRE HAZARD.    WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE NEAREST TOYOTA DEALERSHIP. THEY DETERMINED THAT AN OIL COOLER LINE EXTERNAL TO THE ENGINE - PART OF A TOWING OPTION PACKAGE THE CAR HAS - HAD RUPTURED! THE ENGINE'S OIL HAD BEEN PUMPED OUT BY THE OIL PUMP. WE HAVE SINCE DISCOVERED THAT TOYOTA HAD ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN - T-SB-0201-11 - IN DECEMBER 2011 WHICH ADDRESSED \"OIL SEEPAGE\" FROM THIS EXACT OIL LINE.

I HAVE FILED SEVERAL COMPLAINTS WITH TOYOTA, BUT THEY SAID THEY WOULD NOT COVER THE REPLACEMENT OF MY SEAT BELT, BECAUSE I WAS OUTSIDE OF MY WARRANTY TIME (# OF MILES).  FIRST, THE BELT HAD NEVER BEEN USED (BECAUSE A CHILD SAFETY SEAT HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN THAT POSITION SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE).

THIS SMELL HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT AT HOME, ON OUR TRIP TO THE STORE OR WHEN PARKED THERE.  WHEN I PULLED INTO MY GARAGE, STEAM/SMOKE APPEARED TO BE COMING FROM THE HOOD. THE DIPSTICK SHOWED VERY LOW OIL.  THERE HAD BEEN NO SIGNS OF AN OIL LEAK IN THE GARAGE BEFORE, BUT, AFTER ARRIVING HOME I SAW A BIG OIL LEAK.    I CALLED THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP (1/2 MILE FROM HOME) WHO TOLD ME TO BRING IT UP TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON.  BY THE TIME THAT I GOT THERE MY CAR WAS MAKING A SOUND MAKING IT OBVIOUS SOMETHING VERY WRONG.  I PULLED DIRECTLY INTO THE SERVICE BAY.  THE MECHANIC CHECKED THE DIPSTICK WHICH SHOWED ABSOLUTELY NO OIL IN MY ENGINE.  HE PUT IT ON THE HOIST, ADDED OIL, AND RESTARTED THE ENGINE. THE OIL POURED OUT AS FAST AS HE HAD PUT IT IN.  UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, HE SAW THAT THE LOWER OIL COOLER LINES HAD RUPTURED.  MY ENGINE HAD BEEN CLOSE TO SEIZING.  REPLACING THESE PARTS WAS VERY EXPENSIVE, $437, BUT REPLACING MY ENGINE WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE.  MORE IMPORTANTLY WAS THAT THE DANGER OF A FIRE FROM THE OIL THAT WAS POURING OUT ON THE HOT ENGINE WAS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION.  WHILE AT THE DEALERSHIP, THE MECHANIC POINTED AT A LEXUS AND STATED, \"THIS IS VERY INTERESTING.  THAT LEXUS SUV IS IN HERE FOR THE SAME PROBLEM, THE OIL COOLER LINES RUPTURED.\"  HE SAID THAT HE WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE THIS BE A RECALL ISSUE, AS THE NEW LINES ARE DESIGNED DIFFERENTLY WITHOUT RUBBER FITTINGS, AND WILL NOT RUPTURE.  THIS WOULD INDICATE TO ME THAT TOYOTA HAS NOTICED A DESIGN FLAW IN THE OIL COOLER LINES THAT WERE IN MY HIGHLANDER.    I FEEL THIS OIL COOLER LINES PROBLEM IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RESEARCHED AS A POSSIBLE TOYOTA RECALL.  *TR",

MY PROBLEM IS THAT I CANNOT REMOVE THE SPARE TIRE FROM THE CARRIER CABLE. WE'VE HAD A LOT OF SALT SPRAYED ON THE ROADS RECENTLY AND ALL THE PARTS WERE WHITE. I SPRAYED WITH WD40, BUT NO LUCK. THE MANUAL IS NO HELP AS IT ONLY SHOWS A PICTURE OF THE SPARE AND A ROTATING ARROW. I CAME INSIDE TO LOOK ONLINE TO SEE IF THERE WAS A SOLUTION.. NONE.     I THEN SAW A RECALL LISTED FOR THE 2008-2010 SIENNA (ID# 8250). BECAUSE OF A SAFETY ISSUE WITH SPARE TIRE CARRIER CABLE, IT COULD POSSIBLY BECOME CORRODED AND CAUSE THE SPARE TO FALL OFF FROM UNDER THE VEHICLE.

WHY WEREN'T HIGHLANDER OWNERS LIKE ME NOTIFIED AS WELL? HAVE SIENNA VEHICLES BEEN REPAIRED? NOW I HAVE TO DRIVE THE CAR WITH A FLAT FRONT TIRE TO A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP TO GET THE SPARE TIRE TAKEN OFF THE VEHICLE SO I CAN TAKE THE FLAT OFF AND GET IT REPAIRED.

AS OF TODAY, I HAVE 23, 897 MILES ON THE VEHICLE; AND THE TIRES ARE COMPLETELY WORN OUT TO A POINT BELOW THE WEAR BARS, WHICH INDICATES THAT THEY MUST BE REPLACED NOW.  WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN OCTOBER 2008, I PURCHASED THE TOYOTA MAINTENANCE PROGRAM, SO THE TIRES ARE ROTATED AND BALANCED (IF NECESSARY) EVERY 5,000 MILES WHEN I ALSO CHANGE THE OIL.  I AM A 46 YEAR OLD FATHER OF THREE SMALL CHILDREN, WITH NO MOVING VIOLATIONS, TICKETS OR ACCIDENTS. I TELL YOU THIS ABOUT MY LIFE TO INDICATE THE TYPE OF CONSERVATIVE DRIVER THAT I AM.    I HAVE CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ONLINE AND HAVE IDENTIFIED THE LOWEST PRICE FOR A SET OF FOUR TIRES AT $759.88, WHICH WILL ACTUALLY MORE EXPENSIVE DURING THE BUY DUE TO THE TPMS SYSTEM, THE NECESSITY FOR AN ALIGNMENT WHEN REPLACING FOUR TIRES, AND TAX.      I REALIZE THAT TIRE REPLACEMENT IS JUST ONE PART OF THE OVERALL MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT FOR A VEHICLE.  HOWEVER, TIRES ON A $33,000 VEHICLE SHOULD PROVIDE FAR MORE MILEAGE THAN 24,000 MILES.  IN FACT, IF YOU HAVE THE TIME-I INVITE YOU TO GO THE BLOG TITLED TOYOTA NATION, WHERE ALL OF THE WRITERS CONSISTENTLY MAKE DISPARAGING REMARKS ABOUT TOYOTA?S CHEAP TIRE SELECTION.  SO MUCH IN FACT, WRITERS DISCUSS VARIOUS METHODS FOR OVERCOMING THE BURDEN OF FINDING A SUITABLE, WELL-PRICED REPLACEMENT WHEN THERE ARE ONLY THREE COMPANIES WHO MAKE THE 245/55-R19.  THOSE COMPANIES ARE TOYO, BRIDGESTONE AND HANKOOK.  MOST WRITERS CONVERT TO A LARGER TIRE OR A SMALLER TIRE WITH NEW WHEELS, WHICH OF COURSE AFFECTS NOT ONLY THE SPEEDOMETER/ODOMETER READINGS, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY PERFORMANCE AND POSSIBLY SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE.

SHORTLY BEFORE ARRIVING AT HIS GRANDPARENTS, HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD BECOME TWISTED IN HIS SEATBELT.  AS WE WERE WITHIN 10 MINUTES OF OUR DESTINATION, I TOLD HIM THAT I WOULD HANDLE THE SITUATION WHEN WE ARRIVED.  A FEW MINUTES LATER HE SAID THAT THE BELT WAS GETTING TIGHTER AND I ASKED HIM IF I NEEDED TO STOP AND HE SAID THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.  BEFORE I COULD GET STOPPED (LESS THAT A BLOCK), HE INDICATED THAT HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING.  WHEN I LOOKED BACK, I WAS STARTLED TO FIND THAT THE SEAT BELT HAD BECOME WRAPPED AROUND HIS NECK AND HAD RATCHETED BACK IN, PINNING HIS NECK BACK AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE CAR.  EVEN AFTER STOPPING, I WAS UNABLE TO PULLED THE SEAT BELT OUT TO GET IT OUT FROM AROUND MY SON'S NECK -- HE WAS STRANGLING IN FRONT OF MY EYES.  FORTUNATELY, I WAS IN A CITY WITH RESIDENTS CLOSE BY, ONE OF WHICH HEARD ME SCREAMING AND RUNNING DOOR TO DOOR, WHO BROUGHT OUT A KITCHEN KNIFE TO CUT THE BELT AND RELEASE MY SON.   I REALIZE THAT THESE RATCHET-TYPE SEAT BELTS ARE DESIGNED AS A SAFETY FEATURE IN THE THIRD ROW SEAT OF MANY MAKES AND MODELS, HOWEVER, FEEL THAT THIS DESIGN ALSO PRESENTS A STRANGULATION CONCERN.  IN CASES SUCH AS MINE, THERE WAS NO WAY TO GET THE SEAT BELT RELEASED AND IF THIS HAD OCCUR WHILE ON RURAL ROADS OR THE INTERSTATE, THE AVAILABILITY OF A KNIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFICULT TO COME BY.  I FEEL THAT EITHER AN EMERGENCY RELEASE BUTTON SHOULD BE DESIGNED FOR THE RATCHET SEAT BELTS OR CONSUMERS NEED TO BE AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR STRANGULATION AND ADVISED TO CARRY SCISSORS FOR THIS POSSIBILITY.  I HAVE VOICED MY CONCERNS TO TOYOTA AND THEY ARE REPLACING THE SEAT BELT FREE OF CHARGE, HOWEVER, I FEEL THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT INDIVIDUALS BE AWARE OF THIS POSSIBILITY AND BE PREPARED.  *TR",

WIFE HAS ALSO COMPLAINED ABOUT TRANSMISSION  NOT ENGAGING INTO GEAR WHEN CAR IS FIRST STARTED UP ACTS LIKE YOU DIDN'T SHIFT IT INTO GEAR. WE HAVE ALSO NOTED TRANSMISSION DOESN'T ALWAYS SEEM TO DISENGAGE WHEN SLOWING FROM HIGHWAY SPEEDS 55 MPH.  FEELS LIKE IT IS DRAGGING CAR TO STOP. THERE IS A NOTICEABLE WHINE BETWEEN 55 - 62 MPH. TALKED TO DEALER MECHANIC AND HE SAID THAT WAS NORMAL EVERYTHING IS CONTROLLED BY COMPUTERS. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE IT BACK IN THIS WEEK AND COMPLAIN ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION SLIPPAGE.    WE HAVE ALSO HAD A ISSUE WITH THE TOYO TIRES. AT 28,345 THEY WERE DOWN TO 5/32 TO 4/32. THEY HAVE MAJOR PROBLEMS IN SNOW AND HEAVY RAIN WITH LOSS OF TRACTION. WHEN ESC KICKS ON IN THE SNOW ON A TURN DO TO SLIDING AT SLOW SPEED IT MAKES MATTERS WORSE BE BETTER OFF WITH IT TURNED OFF. *TR",

ON ONE OCCASION, WHILE DRIVING IN TOWN A CAR RAN THROUGH A TRAFFIC LIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  I HIT THE BRAKES HARD - THE VSC LIGHT CAME ON - AND THE CAR SLOWLY STOPPED.  THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT BUT IT WAS EXTREMELY CLOSE.  I HAVE FOUND THAT IF I ROUTINELY PRESS ON THE BRAKE PEDAL UNTIL THE VSC LIGHT COMES ON THAT THE PEDAL TRAVEL IS REDUCED.  I TOOK THE HIGHLANDER TO AAA AUTO DIAGNOSTICS AND THEY CONFIRMED THE PEDAL/VSC.  AAA WAS UNABLE TO READ THE HIGHLANDER COMPUTER BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE THE PROPRIETARY TOYOTA COMPUTER INTERFACE.  THE LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER HAS STATED THAT THE DEPRESSED PEDAL AND VSC LIGHT RESPONSE IS NORMAL.        I ALSO NOTED COMPLAINTS OF SUDDEN ACCELERATION WHEN PUTTING THE CAR INTO GEAR.  I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED A SURGE TO THE DEGREE MENTIONED IN THE COMPLAINTS REFERENCED ABOVE, HOWEVER, WHILE PUTTING THE CAR INTO DRIVE WITH MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE I HAVE HAD THE CAR SURGE FORWARD.  I NOW ALWAYS HAVE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ON WHILE PUTTING THE VEHICLE INTO DRIVE.       THE DATE LISTED BELOW IS THAT OF MY FIRST COMPLAINT TO THE LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER.  *TR",

THEY EXPLAINED IT AS A ECT TRANSMISSION THAT IS COMMON WHEN THE AIR CONDITIONING IS ON.  GIVEN RECENT EVENTS, MY FEAR IT THAT THE EXPLANATION GIVEN TO ME IS NOT ACCURATE.  I CALLED THE DEALER SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE PAST 2 MONTHS TO DETERMINE WHAT MY OPTIONS ARE FOR RECALL AND REPAIR.  THEY CONTINUE TO TELL ME TO WAIT FOR A FLOOR MAT RECALL NOTICE FROM TOYOTA, AND PRIOR TO RECEIVING THAT NOTICE, THEY CANNOT ASSIST.  I CALLED THE NATIONAL TOYOTA SERVICE CENTER 1-800-331-4331 TO FILE AN INCIDENT REPORT.  I EXPLAINED THE SITUATION ABOVE, THEY GAVE ME A CASE NUMBER .  THEY INDICATED THAT OUR VEHICLE WAS MADE IN JAPAN AND SHOULD NOT BE PART OF THE PEDAL RECALL.

THIS TIRE HAPPENS TO BE THE ONLY TIRE MADE TO FIT THIS RIM OTHER THAN A TOYOTA OPEN COUNTRY WHICH APPARENTLY WAS STANDARD ON THE HYBRID MODEL.  WE FOUND THIS TIRE TO BE UNFIT AND UNSAFE FOR A 4,500 LB VEHICLE OF THIS SCALE.  THESE TIRES HYDROPLAN IN RAIN FROM THE MOMENT THEY WERE NEW, AND THEY HANDLED TERRIBLY IN ANY AMOUNT OF SNOW, CAUSING THE REAR OF OUR 4WD VEHICLE TO SLIDE SIDEWAYS WHEN STARTING FROM SIMPLE STOPS.  ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WE HELD OUR BREATH AS WE SLID TOWARD VEHICLES AND PROPERTY WHILE THE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM TRIED IN VAIN TO OVERCOME THE TIRE'S VERY POOR HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS.  IF YOU GO TO TIRERACK.COM YOU WILL SEE THAT THIS TIRE IS RATED EXTREMELY POORLY BY MANY MANY OWNERS OF HIGHLANDERS AND OTHER CARS THAT THEY CAME STANDARD ON.  WHEN I CONTACTED TOYOTA ABOUT THIS, THEY BALKED AT ME, AND COPPED AN ATTITUDE WHEN THEY ASKED IF I SERIOUSLY THOUGHT TOYOTA WAS GOING TO REPLACE MY TIRES FOR ME.  THESE TIRES ARE UNSAFE FOR ANY VEHICLE WHICH WILL TRAVEL IN SNOW OR RAIN.  THE FINAL INSULT OF THESE TIRES IS THAT THEY WERE MORE THAN THREE-QUARTERS WORN OUT BY 15,000 MILES.  WE MILKED THESE TIRES UNTIL ALMOST 30,000 MILES SINCE I REFUSED TO BUY THE SAME TIRE AGAIN, HOPING SOME OTHER MANUFACTURER WOULD COME ALONG WITH A SIMILAR SIZED TIRE - 245/55-19.  THAT NEVER HAPPENED, SO I WENT WITH A 255 WIDTH TIRE AND BROUGHT A WELL RATED HANKOOK.  I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER.  I AM JUST INCENSED THAT TOYOTA COLLUDED WITH BRIDGESTONE TO INSTALL SUCH TERRIBLY CHEAP AND UNSAFE TIRES ON THOUSANDS OF HIGHLANDERS, STRANDING ALL THOSE OWNERS TO SUFFER THE SAME INSTABILITY ISSUES AS WE DID, WHILE THEY DID NOT WORK WITH ANY OTHER TIRE VENDORS TO SUPPLY THIS DISTINCTIVE TIRE DESIGN.  I AM NOT SURE WHO I HOLD IN MORE CONTEMPT - BRIDGESTONE OR TOYOTA.  I DO NOT DOUBT THAT YOU COULD RESEARCH VEHICLE CRASHES INVOLVING HIGHLANDERS AND FIND MANY CAUSED BY POOR TRACTION.  *TW",

I STOPPED AT A TOYOTA DEALER WHO CHECKED THE TIRE TREAD DEPTH, THE DEPTH RANGED FROM 2/32 TO 3/32, THE SERVICE MANAGER STATED THE TIRES WERE UNSAFE.

THIS TIRE IS GETTING TERRIBLE REVIEWS ON TIRERACK.COM FROM CURRENT OWNERS OF MAZDA CX-9S AND HIGHLANDERS, AND THERE ISN'T ANOTHER TIRE ON THE MARKET IN THE SIZE I WOULD NEED TO REPLACE IT.  IT'S AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.    OUR CAR IS A V6 POWERED 4X4 SUV WE BOUGHT BRAND NEW 10 MONTHS AGO.  IT HAS NEVER DRIVEN WELL IN SNOW, AND DESPITE THE FULL-TIME 4-WHEEL DRIVE, THE VEHICLE BEHAVES LIKE A REAR-DRIVE TRUCK WITH SUMMER TIRES.  THE CAR SEVERELY FISHTAILS AND SLIDES SIDEWAYS, WITH THE STABILITY CONTROL FULLY CUTTING POWER AND APPLYING CERTAIN BRAKES IN ATTEMPT TO CORRECT COURSE.
