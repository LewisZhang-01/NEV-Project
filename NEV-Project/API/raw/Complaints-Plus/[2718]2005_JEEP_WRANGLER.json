There is never a time that it does not happen. I would be readily available to make my vehicle available for inspection of this concern.  Chrysler has issued recalls for this exact problem on several of their vehicle models all within the same time period of manufacturing.  The fuel tank inlet check valve is a widely known and dangerous issue that should be seriously considered to repair the remaining vehicles on the road with this problem. It has been documented by numerous owners of Jeep Wranglers from 2005-2006 while the same issue forced a recall of the same Jeeps in later model years, 2007-2008. The Jeep has been inspected by a certified mechanic where I was notified of much of this information.  With the amount of gasoline that spills out and the motorist re-enters their vehicle, there could be a static charge that could ignite the gasoline and cause extreme personal harm and property damage. There is no indication or warning sign to alert you that it is going to splash out gasoline. I am left to rarely fill my fuel tank to the maximum level to avoid being soaked in gasoline and irritating my skin or worse. I have owned this Jeep for going on 4 years and it has been a concern since day 1. I am noting this report of having been injured but the injuries at this point are only skin irritations as a result of gasoline coming in contact with our skin. I also noted the date as the first time this happened but as mentioned before, it happens or will happen at every fill up.",

I TOOK IT TO THE TIRE SHOP AND THEY INSPECTED THE TIE-ROD ENDS AND FOUND NO PROBLEM. IT WAS SHAKING SO BAD I THOUGHT THAT SURELY MY FRONT END WAS COMING APART SO, I GOOGLED MY PROBLEM AND WAS LED TO A PLETHORA OF INFORMATION AND FOUND THE TERM \"DEATH WOBBLE\", I THOUGHT IT FELT LIKE DRIVING OVER RAILROAD TRACKS, BUT DEATH WOBBLE SEEMS TO ALSO BE AN APPROPRIATE TERM AS WELL, BECAUSE THE FRONT END SEEMS TO BE SHAKING TO DEATH. I, LIKE SO MANY OTHERS, WENT TO KEVIN'S OFF ROAD, KOR, WEBSITE AND READ ABOUT THE POTENTIAL CAUSES AND CURES. IN MY PARTICULAR CASE THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY AFTERMARKET MODIFICATIONS, IT'S AS STOCK AS THEY COME. ANYWAY, KEVIN'S RECOMMENDED SOLUTION TO MY \"WOBBLE\" IS TO REPLACE THE TRACK BAR, THE STEERING DAMPER, CONTROL ARMS AND BUSHINGS. THE COST FOR THIS IS AROUND $366 FOR THE PARTS AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE LABOR COSTS WILL BE. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MAYBE SOMEONE AT CHRYSLER SHOULD ACTUALLY GO DRIVE ONE BEFORE THEY SAY \"IT'S NOT OUR FAULT\". THEY SHOULD BE PART OF THE SOLUTION SINCE THEY CREATED THE PROBLEM. MY 1989 JEEP DOESN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM, LEAF SPRINGS VS. INDEPENDENT COIL SPRINGS, PERHAPS,... A SMOOTHER RIDE BUT AT WHAT COST? $366 PLUS LABOR FOR ME. CAN YOU PLEASE HELP APPLY PRESSURE TO CHRYSLER TO MAKE THIS RIGHT? THANKS FOR YOUR TIME AND INTEREST.   *TR",

OVER THE YEARS, THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS I HAD WERE THE INFAMOUS SHAKING OF THE CAR AT SPEEDS OVER ABOUT 55MPH AND THE CONSTANT NEED TO JUMP THE CAR AND BUY NEW BATTERIES.  THE LATTER PROBLEM SEEMED LIKE SOMETHING I COULD LIVE WITH BUT OVER TIME IT BECAME WORSE AND YOU COULD NO LONGER RELY ON THE CAR TO START.  JEEP HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY CAVALIER ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS, BUT THEY ARE REAL. MY CAR NOW HAS ONLY ABOUT 17,000 MILES ON IT BECAUSE OF THE RELIABILITY PROBLEM. IN JANUARY 2011 THERE WAS AN ELECTRICAL EXPLOSION AND SMOKE IN THE CAR.  IT WAS TOWED TO LITHIA JEEP IN SANTA FE NM (WHERE I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT IT).  THEY COULDN'T REALLY FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM, BUT CHARGED ME  FOR SOME REWIRING AND SENT IT BACK TO ME.  WITHIN DAYS, THE BATTERY WAS DEAD AGAIN, SO I BOUGHT A NEW BATTERY.   WITHIN DAYS, THAT BATTERY WAS DEAD AND THE CAR WAS AGAIN TOWED TO JEEP. THIS TIME, I FILED A FORMAL COMPLAINT WITH CHRYSLER, WHO ACCEPTED THE CASE.THE DEALER FIDDLED AROUND WITH THE CAR WITHOUT SUCCESS FOR A MONTH, BEFORE CHRYSLER AGREED TO ACCEPT MOST OF THE CHARGES FOR A COMPREHENSIVE REWIRING OF THE CAR.   THE DEALER ALSO INFORMED ME AT THE TIME THAT IT WAS UNABLE TO DO THE RECALL WORK ON THE CAR'S TRANSMISSION, BECAUSE THE BOLTS SECURING THE TRANSMISSION HAD BEEN STRIPPED AT THE FACTORY.  THIS SEEMED ODD TO ME, THAT A DEALER WAS TELLING ME IT COULDN'T DO THE RECALL WORK ON A DANGEROUS CONDITION, SO I JUST HAD TO LIVE WITH IT. IN MARCH THE DEALER COMMENCED THE INTENSIVE REWIRING WORK, AND BY APRIL, THE DEALER SAID THAT THE PROBLEM HAD NOT YET BEEN RESOLVED, SO IT WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM CHRYSLER. THIS CARRIED ON INTO MAY, AND I STILL DID NOT HAVE THE CAR.  FINALLY, IN LATE MAY, THE DEALER CALLED AND SAID THEY \"THOUGHT THE CAR MIGHT BE FIXED\" BUT WEREN'T SURE, BECAUSE THE COMPUTER WAS STILL IDENTIFYING AN UNKNOWN DRAIN ON THE BATTERY WITH POTENTIAL ELECTRICAL SHORT IMPLICATIONS.

IT WOULD SPIT OUT ABOUT A SECOND AFTER THE NOZZLE SHUT OFF. LIKE MANY OTHERS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM, I BLAMED THE STATIONS EQUIPMENT. I TRIED OTHER STATIONS & OTHER TECHNIQUES LIKE FILLING SLOWER & TRYING TO ANTICIPATE WHEN THE TANK WOULD BE FULL & FILLING AS SLOWLY AS THE NOZZLE WOULD ALLOW. NOTHING SEEMED TO PREVENT THE SPIT BACK. I RECENTLY BECAME AWARE OF THE WORKINGS OF THE VAPOR CONTROL PROPERTIES OF MY JEEP. THAT LED ME TO AN INTERNET FORUM & TO THE FACT OTHERS ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. I ALSO SAW THAT THE NHTSA HAS INVESTIGATED THIS PROBLEM ON 2007 & 2008 WRANGLERS & THAT HAS LED TO CHRYSLER VOLUNTARILY EXTENDING THE WARRANTY ON THOSE GAS TANKS. HOWEVER, IN THEIR FINAL REPORT THE NHTSA (PE10-032) SEEMED CRITICAL OF THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS BECAUSE OF INTERNET EXPOSURE. IF THIS EXPOSURE LEADS TO IDENTIFYING MORE PEOPLE WITH LEGITIMATE COMPLAINTS, HOW IS THIS A BAD THING? THESE ASSERTIONS MAY BE EASILY VERIFIED BY A TRIP TO A FILLING STATION. PART OF CHRYSLERS RESPONSE WAS BASED ON WARRANTY CLAIMS, IT IS LOGICAL THAT THE OLDER & OUT OF WARRANTY VEHICLES WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN THEIR EVALUATION. I BELIEVE THAT EXTENDING THE WARRANTY RATHER THAN A RECALL IS A GOOD WAY OF HANDLING THIS (REPLACING ONLY THE TANKS WITH PROBLEMS) & I APPLAUD CHRYSLER FOR THIS. I HOPE YOU WILL ENCOURAGE CHRYSLER TO ADD THE 2004-2006 WRANGLERS TO THE EXTENDED GAS TANK WARRANTY PROGRAM AS WE ARE EXPERIENCING THE EXACT SAME ISSUE AS THE 07 & 08S ARE. THE FAIR ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE A SAFETY RECALL.  THE IDENTIFIED FAILURE SEEMS TO BE A CHECK VALVE IN THE GAS TANK.",

WHEN CLEARED, THE CODE DID NOT RETURN AND THE JEEP RAN NORMALLY UNTIL APPROXIMATELY MARCH 26, WHEN IT WENT INTO A \"LIMP MODE\" (REV LIMITER MOVED TO 2500 RPM) AFTER BEING REVVED TO 4500 RPM.  WHEN RESTARTED, THE VEHICLE RAN FINE, ALTHOUGH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  THE CODE WAS P0344.  WHEN THE CODE WAS CLEARED, IT DID NOT REAPPEAR.  HOWEVER, REVVING THE ENGINE TO 4500 RPM IN ALL GEARS EXCEPT REVERSE (N-1-2-3-4-5-6)  REPRODUCED THE ABOVE RESULTS WITHOUT FAIL.  ON MARCH 28, A REPLACEMENT CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSOR WAS ORDERED BY MYSELF, AND WAS INSTALLED ON APRIL 2.  AFTER THE INSTALL, REVVING THE ENGINE TO 4500 RPM ONCE AGAIN PUT THE VEHICLE INTO A \"LIMP MODE\". I MADE THE DECISION TO TAKE THE JEEP TO SOUTH POINT CHRYSLER DODGE JEEP IN AUSTIN, TX.  ON MAY 6, I WAS INFORMED THAT STANDARD DIAGNOSTICS COULD NOT FIND THE ISSUE, AND THE DEALER REQUESTED 4 HOURS OF TEAR-DOWN TIME TO INSPECT THE CAMSHAFT AREA FOR DAMAGE BASED ON RECOMMENDATIONS FROM CHRYSLER.  UPON APPROVAL, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE OIL PUMP GEAR AND CAMSHAFT WERE HEAVILY DAMAGED POSSIBLY DUE TO CAUSES OUTLINED IN NHTSA ITEM # 10013784.  WHEN CHRYSLER WAS CONTACTED FOR THIS, THEY INFORMED ME THAT, ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT THE VIN OF MY JEEP IS OUTSIDE OF THE VIN RANGE OF THE TSB, THERE WAS NO \"DEFINITIVE PROOF\" THAT THE OIL PUMP GEAR HAD DAMAGED THE CAMSHAFT AS OPPOSED TO VICE VERSA AND THEY WOULD BE UNABLE TO ASSIST IN THE REPAIR COST.

I BELIEVE THIS IS DUE TO THE DESIGN OF THE JEEP GAS TANK HAVING ONE OF THE TWO PRESSURE TUBES INVOLVING AN INNER TUBE THAT EXTENDS SEVERAL INCHES INTO THE TANK TO ATTEMPT TO EQUALIZE PRESSURE WHICH ACTUALLY CREATES AN AIR IMBALANCE THAT ALLOWS FOR FUEL TO SURGE BACK UP THE SPOUT DURING REFUELING WHEN THE FUEL FLOW INTO THE TANK IS STOPPED. *TR",

THERE WERE TWO CRACKS (POSSIBLY INITIATED FROM ONE POINT BELOW THE MOLDING). THE CRACKS STARTED ON THE BOTTOM JUST OFF CENTER AND WENT UP ABOUT TWO INCHES AND THEN CURVED 90 DEGREES AND WENT HORIZONTALLY ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD. THE JEEP WARRANTY BOOK SAYS IT COVERS DEFECTS IN THE GLASS FOR ONE YEAR OR 12,000 MILES. SINCE MY JEEP WAS PAST THIS POINT MY INSURANCE COVERED IT. THEY HAD SAFELITE AUTOGLASS PUT IN A NEW WINDSHIELD ON DECEMBER 27, 2007.    SIX DAYS LATER' ON JANUARY 2, 2008 ON MY WAY TO WORK THE WINDSHIELD CRACKED AGAIN WHILE DRIVING. THE REPLACEMENT WINDSHIELD WAS LESS THAN ONE WEEK OLD! THIS TIME THERE WERE THREE CRACKS. ONE WENT STRAIGHT UP FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE WINDSHIELD TO THE TOP, MOLDING TO MOLDING. THE OTHER TWO WERE SIMILAR TO THE FIRST TIME. THEY BEGAN AT THE BOTTOM, WENT UP TWO INCHES AND TURNED 90 DEGREES AND BECAME HORIZONTAL CRACKS. THE CRACKS COULD HAVE INITIATED FROM A SINGLE POINT BELOW THE MOLDING. THIS TIME THE CRACKS STARTED MORE TOWARD THE CENTER, ABOUT 4 INCHES CLOSER TO THE DRIVER SIDE THAN THE FIRST CRACKED WINDSHIELD.     THE AUTO GLASS TECHNICIAN SAID THAT CRACKED WINDSHIELDS ARE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH JEEP WRANGLERS. I HAVE READ ONLINE FORUMS AND A LOT OF JEEP OWNERS ARE HAVING THIS SAME ISSUE. ALSO, A CO-WORKER HAD THE SAME THING HAPPEN TO HIS JEEP. HE WENT THROUGH 2 WINDSHIELDS IN 3 YEARS. IT SOUNDS LIKE A SYSTEMATIC SAFETY ISSUE WITH JEEP WRANGLERS. I HOPE THAT JEEP WILL CORRECT THIS QUALITY DEFICIENCY BEFORE ANYONE GETS HURT. I CALLED THE JEEP CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY COULDN'T CORRECT THEIR DEFECTIVE VEHICLE. IF THE WINDSHIELD CRACKS OR 'SPIDER WEBS' WHILE DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY, THIS ISSUE COULD LEAD TO A SEVERE ACCIDENT AND/OR DEATH IF IT HASN'T ALREADY.*CN",

I ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING WHEEL SHAKING ONCE I HIT A SMALL BUMP IN THE ROAD,AS SMALL AS THE REFLECTORS THAT LINE THE MIDDLE OF STREETS.

MY OTHER ISSUE WITH THIS LOVLEY DEATH TRAP OF MINE IS WHEN I RUN THE A/C THE WHOLE THING BOGS DOWN LIKE I'M PULLING AN EIGHTEEN WHEELER OUT OF A DITCH. THE DEALERSHIP SOLUTION WAS TO COME IN AND TEST DRIVE ANOTHER JEEP TO SEE IF I \"ACTUALLY HAVE A PROBLEM\". WHEN I TAKE MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY KEEP IT FOR AT LEAST TWO WEEKS AND THE PROBLEMS ARE STILL THERE.MY ADVICE TO OTHER JEEP OWNERS WITH THESE PROBLEMS IS TO ALWAYS TAKE THE BACK ROADS AND ALWAYS LEAVE A CAR LENGTH OF SPACE ALL THE WAY AROUND YOUR JEEP, AND NEVER USE THE A/C!THESE PROBLEMS BEGAN  AT ABOUT 10,000 MILES AND MY JEEP JUST ROLLED OVER32,000 MILES.  *JB",

TOOK TO DEALERSHIP AND WAS FLUFFED, I.E., COULD HAVE BEEN A PLASTIC BAG, ONLY SMELL WAS NEW CAR SMELL, ETC., THEY EVEN CLAIMED TO HAVE DRIVEN IT WITH WINDOWS DOWN.   THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE SO I SENT MY HUSBAND  THERE AND SERVICE MANAGER EXPERIENCED THE BURNING EYES AND NAUSEA DURING RIDE.  CALLED JEEP AND WAS TOLD THEY COULDN'T DISCUSS ANY SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS, REFERRED ME TO DEALERS.  2ND FIX ATTEMPT 9/15/05 @1344 MILES RESULTED IN \"NO FAULT CODES IN SYSTEM, PERFORMED FUEL SYSTEM MONITOR TEST READING NOT IN SPECS, EXCESSIVE FUEL THROUGH SYSTEM.\" CHANGED SOFTWARE, WROTE \"ROAD TESTED VEHICLE, HAS SLIGHT RESIDUE ODOR.
