HE ADDED SOME, AND TOLD ME I COULD MAKE IT THE REST OF THE WAY HOME (AN HOUR ON THE INTERSTATE/HIGHWAY).  I DID MAKE IT HOME, BUT THE CAR NEVER STARTED AGAIN.  I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A DODGE DEALERSHIP NEAR MY HOUSE, AND WAS TOLD REPAIR COST WOULD BE AROUND $6500.  THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THE ENGINE WAS FLAWED - THE OIL LINES ARE TOO SMALL TO SUFFICIENTLY LUBRICATE THE ENGINE, AND THE ENGINE BURNS SO HOT THE OIL IT DOES GET JUST SLEDGES IT UP.

THIS OCCURRED WHILE I WAS STILL IN GEAR AND MOVING AT SPEEDS OF 50 MPH, 35 MPH, 25 MPH, AND WHEN JUST STARTING OUT AFTER BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE. THOSE TIMES WHEN I HAD SUFFICIENT SPEED, THE ENGINE WOULD RESTART WITHIN 10 SECONDS - IF I LEFT THE VEHICLE IN GEAR. AT OTHER SPEEDS, THE TRUCK STOPPED DEAD IN THE ROADWAY - WITH TRAFFIC BEHIND ME HAVING TO SLAM ON THEIR BRAKES.  THE INTERNET IS LITTERED WITH STORIES OF THE FAILURE OF THE ABS/REAR WHEEL SPEED SENSOR IN DODGE VEHICLES. (FOR EXAMPLES, SEE WWW.DODGEDAKOTAS.COM). THERE ARE, HOWEVER, NO INDICATIONS OF RELATED ACCIDENTS. I SUSPECT IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.   I RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM VIA THE INTERNET AND TOOK MY VEHICLE TO MY LOCAL DEALER AND HAD THEM REPLACE THE PART (AT A COST OF $85 +$36.10). THE VEHICLE HAS NOT EXHIBITED ANY OF THE ABOVE SYMPTOMS SINCE REPLACING THE SENSOR.  I RETAINED THE FAILED PART.  THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT THIS SENSOR SHOULD NOT CAUSE THE ENGINE TO STALL. THERE ARE NO DIAGNOSTIC CODES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FAILURE. MY BELIEF IS THAT THE FIRMWARE FOR THE ONBOARD COMPUTER MUST BE FLASHED FOR ALL MODELS (AND THE ISSUE CORRECTED FOR ANY FUTURE MODELS) SO THAT THE ENGINE IS NOT TOLD TO SHUT DOWN.  I WOULD ADD THAT, SINCE THIS SENSOR IS ASSOCIATED WITH EMISSIONS, THE REPLACEMENT AND LABOR SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY.  THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME VENT!  *JB",

I WAS IN NORTHERN MAINE AND I LOST MY POWER STEERING. I HAD TO WALK THROUGH THE WOODS TO A CABIN I COULD SEE HAD ITS HOUSE LIGHT ON AND KNOCK ON THE DOOR FOR HELP. ONCE MY TRUCK WAS FREED FROM BEING STUCK I HAD TO DRIVE 3 MILES BACK TO THE MOUNTAIN W/NO POWER STEERING. WHEN I BROUGHT IT TO THE LOCAL DEALER THEY SHOWED ME THAT THERE WAS SOME LONG SILVER ROD LIKE THING, WHICH HAD JUST BROKEN IN HALF!! I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF IT BECAUSE IT WAS STILL COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. A WHILE LATER, MY BRAKE SYSTEM HAD TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF  $800. I SAID I JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY AT THAT TIME. LEE DODGE OF WESTBROOK MAINE CALLED AND SAID THEY COULD FIX THE PROBLEM FOR $150!  I HAD AN ACCIDENT ABOUT JANUARY 2001 AND MY AIRBAG DID NOT GO OFF.  I WAS RUN OFF THE ROAD IN A SNOWSTORM AND HIT A TREE. THIS PAST JUNE MY TRUCK WENT IN TO BE INSPECTED AND I WAS TOLD MY UPPER CONTROL ARMS AND BALL JOINTS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED!! EVEN I KNEW THAT AT 44K OR SO MILES IT WAS FAR TOO SOON FOR ME TO NEED THOSE PARTS REPLACED. I LIVE ON A FIXED INCOME BECAUSE I AM DISABLED. WHEN I WENT TO PICK UP MY TRUCK MY PASSENGER SIDE DOOR WOULD NO LONGER CLOSE CORRECTLY, MY HOOD WOULD NO LONGER OPEN AND THE HEADLIGHT PROBLEM BECAME MUCH WORSE.  BEFORE I HAD THE CHANCE TO HAVE THE CAR LOOKED AT,  I HAD AN ACCIDENT. I HAD PULLED OUT OF MY DRIVE AND MY BOYFRIEND PULLED OUT AFTER ME IN MY BROTHER?S CAR. WHEN HE PULLED OUT OF A DRIVE, I WENT TO PULL UP ALONG SIDE HIM, MY TIRES WERE SPINNING ON PILES OF WET LEAVES, MY WHEEL WOULD NOT RESPOND, MY GAS AND MY BRAKE WOULD NOT RESPOND. I HAD BOTH FEET ON THE FLOOR NOT EITHER GAS OR BRAKE... THE TRUCK THEN THRUST FORWARD AND HIT MY BROTHER?S CAR!",

LOOKING AT THE TRUCK THE NEXT MORNING SHOWED A WORN RUBBER HOSE IN THE BRAKE LINE. THE RIM OF THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL HAD RUBBED A HOLE IN THE LINE. IT APPEARED THERE WAS A BENT BRACKET THAT SUPPORTS THE BRAKE LINE AND THAT'S WHAT ALLOWED THE LINE TO \"GET INTO\" THE WHEEL. I HAVEN'T RUN OVER ANY DEBRIS THAT COULD CAUSE THE BRACKET TO BEND AND THE TRUCK HASN'T BEEN IN ANY ACCIDENTS. IT'S MY OPINION, THAT IF A BRAKE LINE IS TO BE MOUNTED THAT CLOSE TO THE WHEEL, IT SHOULD BE WELL SHIELDED OR SECURED WITH HARDWARE THAT COULD NOT BE SO EASILY DEFORMED AND ALLOWING THE BRAKE LINE TO MOVE TOWARD THE WHEEL. THE WHEEL ONLY TOUCHES THE LINE WHEN THE WHEEL IS TURNED ALL THE WAY TO THE LEFT. THE LEFT FRONT BRAKE LINE IS ABOUT AN INCH OR INCH AND A HALF FROM THE LEFT WHEEL AND IS NOT WORN.   THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY DEFECT IN MY OPINION, AS I WAS DRIVING ON MOUNTAIN ROADS THE DAY BEFORE THE INCIDENT.

I HAVEN'T TRIED TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER BUT SEVERAL PEOPLE WITH THE SAME MODEL TRUCK HAVE AND DC IS BEING VERY TIGHT LIPPED CONCERNING THE REDUCED TOWING ISSUE, BASICALLY THEY WOULD RATHER \"BUYBACK\" THE VEHICLE THAN SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE CAUSE FOR THE WEIGHT REDUCTION.",

THAT IS TRULY UNACCEPTABLE SINCE WE BOUGHT THIS TRUCK FOR WORKING AND NOW IT CAN BARELY TOW A GOOD SIZED TRAILER.  ALL THE DOCUMENTATION THAT I HAVE READ SAYS THAT THE DAKOTA R/T CAN TOW 6400LBS.
