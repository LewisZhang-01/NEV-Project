THE WORKER  REPLACING THE WHEEL ON THE PASSENGER  SIDE DAMAGED THE WHEEL STUDS BECAUSE HE WAS ON A HURRY. THE LEAD WORKER AND TWO OTHERS SPENT 2 HOURS TRYING TO FIX THE STUDS AND GET SOME OF THE LUG NUTS BACK ON. THEY MANAGED TO GET 5 OUT OF THE SIX ON. THEY INSISTED ON SENDING ME HOME WITH A WHEEL MISSING ONE LUG NUT. THEY ASKED ME TO COMEBACK TOMORROW OR SOME OTHER DAY TO FIX IT. IT WAS CLOSE TO 9 PM BY THAT TIME, AND I WAS FRUSTRATED. I DROVE HOME AND ON THE WAY HOME, THE CENTER HUB PLASTIC COVERING  FELL OFF. IT EXPOSED THE AXLE/BEARING. I FEEL THAT VEHICLE IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE DRIVING MY TODDLER AROUND. SHOPS LIKE THE ONE MENTIONED SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO OPERATE BECAUSE THEY COMPROMISE DRIVERS' SAFETY.I WOULD LIKE 1. A REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE OVERPRICED TIRES AND 2.

THE FRONT SIDE MARKER LIGHTS SHARE THE FUSE WHICH ALSO PROTECTS THE TAIL LIGHTS, SO WHEN THE SHORT OCCURS THE TAIL LIGHTS BECOME INOPERATIVE.

HE EXPLAINED TO HE COULD NOT DO ANYTHING AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO CONTACT MY INSURANCE. I QUESTIONED HIM WHY I HAVE TO SUFFER GOING THROUGH MY INSURANCE WHEN THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY A MANUFACTURER DEFECT AND MY VEHICLE WAS STILL UNDER THE BASIC WARRANTY. KNOWING I WAS NOT GETTING ANYWHERE WITH THIS GUY, I REQUESTED A PHONE NUMBER FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND HE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THEY WOULD ONLY REFER ME BACK TO HIM. I AM CONFUSED ON WHAT I SHOULD DO.
