As I did this I noticed that a white smoke had begun to enter the car through the AC diffusers. Smoke was also seen  exiting from front right side of engine hood and through the exterior fresh air channel (the wiper blade area). The smoke had the odor associated with a fire and not the odor of  electrical component malfunction. I turned engine off and exited quickly along with getting my middle row occupant,  my 60 lb canine  companion, out of the vehicle and into my house.  I was not sure what was happening to the vehicle. So I went back out and by this time I could see a lot of white smoke coming from engine compartment. My next door neighbor's father  called 911. Before the fire department arrived the vehicle was engulfed in flames. This all occurred within a 10 minute time frame and the heat of the fire damage 2 of my nearby parked vehicles.

My mom was next to me and yelled, \u201cWhat are you doing there are cars behind us.\u201d I said I didn\u2019t know what was happening and started pushing on the gas to go again. I immediately took it to the dealer and told them I don\u2019t feel safe driving it until they can fix the brake issue. The manager told me this happened to another lady in a \u201822 CRV from the same dealership, but she was on surface streets. It started w the black screening and than the random braking. Long story short, they replaced the tuner on her car and she hasn\u2019t had issues in about 5-6 weeks. They told me to wait for the part, and while I wait, they can turn the safety features off. I said no thanks, I\u2019ll leave it until they are sure it\u2019s fixed. They won\u2019t give me a loaner so I\u2019ve been borrowing my parents\u2019 car.

The van drove great Until we came home Thursday evening. I was 25 miles into our trip, driving 75 mph keeping up with the traffic on 121 and all a sudden my van had a huge thud jerk like as if I hit a curb and then I lost all acceleration. I hit the gas and all that happened was the RPMs would skyrocket but no power. My speed went from 75 to 40 to 20 within seconds. I\u2019m in the middle lane with cars speeding past and a semi coming up behind me. I AM SCARED!! I quickly call my husband while I attempt to get to to shoulder. I finally get over and I put the van in park. Cars are going so fast that the van is shaking anytime a car goes by. I put the van in drive in hopes to get to an exit. Absolutely NO acceleration. I KNEW this was a transmission issue. I was able to coast off to the next exit and into a parking lot.  I had it towed to the dealer. Upon first inspection they said nothing was wrong with it. I told them to keep checking because there was something major wrong with it. A few hours later they called and said my transmission was being replaced and that Honda was aware of some issues with this year\u2019s transmission. I asked if there was a recall yet as this was dangerous. They said no. I feel that\u2019s extremely unsafe to continue to sell these vans without disclosing the known transmission issue. I feel quite cheated that I was allowed to buy a $40000 without any disclosure of a potential issue. We would have waited to buy a van then. Very very unethical",

        "summary": "On 6-10-21, we purchased a 2022 Honda Odyssey from Millennium Honda, Hempstead, NY.   On the drive home, my husband immediately noticed a strong odor & felt the car acting strange on gear (like a shift that was out of place) but thought it was just part of being a new car.  On 6-11-21,  I drove the car with my 2 kids (2 & 5)  and mom and she noticed a strong odor like \"burnt rubber\".  The infotainment system froze & shut down twice. The car felt strange when I was accelerating. On 6-12-21,  I was driving with my children on the NJ Garden State Parkway & approximately 40 minutes into the ride, the RPM needles starting oscillating very quickly between gears. The car felt strange when I was trying to accelerate.  The infotainment system froze at least 2 to 3 xs.  We arrived at our destination, parked the car and turned it off.   That evening as I was driving back home on the Parkway approx. 20 minutes into the drive the RPM needles started oscillating very quickly, the car started shifting gears and making loud sounds.  I tried to move to the right shoulder as there was a lot of traffic but the car would not accelerate despite pressing hard on the gas pedal. A few minutes later a warning message displayed \"Transmission temperature near limit. Performance may be reduced.\"   I pulled the car over horrified. We called the dealership & Honda roadside service but they could send a tow truck because I was on a state highway.  My husband came to get us and after an hour he was able to slowly drive the car on \"sport mode\" at about 25 m/p/h.  We reported the incident to our dealership and Honda America operations & they have opened a case number.  The vehicle was towed today to a local Honda dealer for assessment.  THIS IS A SIGNFICANT SAFETY ISSUE THAT POSES RISK OF HARM AND DEATH TO DRIVERS.  HONDA MARKETS THIS VEHICLE TO FAMILIES & MY FAMILY'S LIFE WAS PUT IN JEOPARDY IMMEDIATELY UPON PURCHASE.  THIS CAR WAS OUT OF SERVICE WITHIN 48 HOURS OF SALE.",
