AFTER I PULLED OUT OF THE GAS STATION AND DROVE A FEW BLOCKS I NOTICED THE NEEDLE FOR THE THERMOSTAT WAS AT THE HOTTEST LEVEL POSSIBLE.  THE NEXT MORNING I TOOK MY CAR IN, IT OVERHEATED IN THE 5 MINUTES IT TO ME TO ARRIVE TO THE SHOP.  I WAS INFORMED THE ENGINE HAD STRIPPED HEAD BOLTS AND I WOULD NEED A NEW ENGINE .

THE PROBLEM THAT I'VE ENCOUNTERED IS THE TREAD IS SEPARATING FROM THE SIDE WALLS ON BOTH FRONT TIRES AND I CAN FEEL THAT THE REAR TIRES ARE STARTING TO DO THE SAME.  FORTUNATELY FOR ME I SPOTTED THIS DEFECT BEFORE AN INCIDENT OCCURRED.  CURRENTLY THE CORDS ARE EXPOSED ON TOP OF THE TIRES.  THEY ALMOST FEEL LIKE THE TIRES WHERE RECAPPED AND ARE NOW SEPARATING.  I JUST NOTICED IT TODAY 28 NOV 2008 AND I'LL HAVE TO REPLACE THE TIRES TOMORROW.  I ONLY HAVE APPROX. 25,000 MILES ON THESE SPECIFIC TIRES AND THEY ARE RATED FOR 80,000 MILES.  THIS IS A POTENTIAL SAFETY/RECALL ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY ESPECIALLY IF OCCURRING TO OTHERS.  PLEASE INFORM IF A RECALL IS PRESENT FOR THESE TIRES.  THANK YOU!!! *TR",

THIS IS ERRONEOUS, AS THE OWNER'S MANUAL TELLS YOU TO LIFT AFTER PUSHING THE BUTTON.  THIS LIFTING OVER TIME CAUSES WEAR OF THE TINY PLASTIC PIECES THAT ARE BEARING THE WEIGHT OF THE ENTIRE REAR/HATCH BACK DOOR.  AFTER HAVING THIS PROBLEM I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD, AND NOT MANY HAVE THIS KIND OF FAULTY DESIGN.  THE SAFETY ISSUE IS TWO-FOLD: NUMBER ONE, THE LIGHT ON TOP OF THIS MECHANISM IS THE BRAKE LIGHT.  IT JUST FALLS OFF OVER TIME.  ONCE IT IS BROKEN, THERE IS NO WAY TO HOLD IT IN PLACE AND IT BLOCKS THE LICENSE PLATE AND ALSO COULD FALL OFF ENTIRELY AND DAMAGE ANOTHER VEHICLE.    NEEDLESS TO SAY I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS DESIGNED INTO THE VEHICLE.  I AM CONVINCED THAT NUMEROUS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM AS BOTH THE DEALERSHIP AND THE SCION HELP LINE ADMITTED THAT THIS HAPPENS FREQUENTLY.  THEY ALL SEEM TO BE IN COLLUSION ABOUT IT BEING A DESIGN DEFECT EVEN THOUGH THEY ADMIT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE WEIGHT BEARING ASPECT OF THE TRUNK LATCH.  I WAS TO OPEN IT BY TOUCHING THE BUTTON AND THEN LIFTING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE TRUNK.  WHEN DOING THIS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO OPEN THE DOOR AS THE LATCH NEEDS TO BE PUSHED AT THE SAME TIME IT IS LIFTED UPWARD.  OTHERWISE THE LATCH JUST STAYS LOCKED.      I FIND THIS WHOLE SITUATION PROBLEMATIC AS I PURCHASED A SCION BECAUSE OF TOYOTA'S SOLID REPUTATION OF STANDING BY THEIR VEHICLES.  AS MAY VEHICLE IS PAST ITS WARRANTY THIS DEFECT IS NOT COVERED.  I WAS TOLD THAT AS ONE TIME GESTURE THEY WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM IF I PAID FOR IT AND THEN APPLIED FOR REIMBURSEMENT.  I LIVE FROM PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK AND DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO FIX THE DANGLING DOOR LATCH.  AFTER SPEAKING WITH SCION OVER SEVERAL DAYS THEY AGREED TO COVER THE REPAIR IF THE DEALERSHIP WOULD BILL SCION FOR THE COST.  THE ISSUE IS THAT IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.  *TR",

I COULD HEAR THE SALESMAN, YOU HAVE TO FIX IT!  ITS A BRAND NEW CAR!  THE SERVICE REP FINALLY CAME TO MY CAR AND SAID WE WILL FIX IT THIS TIME BUT IF YOU DRIVE AWAY AND IT HAPPENS AGAIN THEN WE WONT BECAUSE THIS CAR IS NOT UNDER THE RECALL BECAUSE THE LAMINATE HAS ALREADY BEEN PUT ON THE CAR.
