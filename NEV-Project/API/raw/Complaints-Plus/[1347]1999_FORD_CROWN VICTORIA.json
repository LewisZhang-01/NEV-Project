[XXX] PLACED A TEMPORARY WELD WHICH HAS HELD UP JUST FINE, HOWEVER HE SAID THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER ISSUES WITH THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF FORDS ORIGINAL DESIGN AND THAT ULTIMATELY THE MANIFOLD WILL FAIL AT THESE WEAK POINTS WITH TIME. I DON'T PUT HEAVY MILES ON MY VEHICLE &  ONLY HAVE 41,102 MILES ON IT NOW. ALL SERVICES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED AT 3000 MILE INTERVALS FROM AUTHORIZED MECHANICS. I HAVE ALL RECEIPTS OF MY SERVICE RECORDS AND FEEL THAT THE ONLY REASON I DIDN'T EXPERIENCE A FAILURE EARLIER IS BECAUSE OF MY DILIGENT EFFORTS TO FOLLOW THE RECOMMENDED SERVICE INTERVALS SET FORTH IN THE VEHICLES MAINTENANCE LOG. I FEEL THAT IT WAS AND STILL IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF FORD TO SEEK OUT ALL OWNERS UNTIL EACH VEHICLE HAS BEEN REPAIRED.

APPROXIMATELY 2 MONTHS AGO, I STARTED EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING HOT BUT NOT OVERHEATING AND WHAT APPEARED TO BE A COOLANT LEAK.  I IMMEDIATELY REPLACED THE RADIATOR HOSE.  IT DID NOT HELP.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO HAVE THE OIL CHANGED AND ASKED THAT THE COOLANT SYSTEM BE PRESSURE TESTED FOR LEAKS.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE INCREASED TEMPERATURE OF THE ENGINE HAD CAUSED THE THERMOSTAT HOUSING TO CRACK AND IT WAS ALSO DIAGNOSED TO NEED THE INTAKE MANIFOLD REPLACED.  I PARKED THE VEHICLE FOR THE NEXT 2 1/2 MONTHS.  DUE TO FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS, I COULD NOT AFFORD THE REPAIR WHICH WAS ESTIMATED TO BE $750 -850.  NOW THAT I AM ABLE TO MAKE THE REPAIRS, A CALL TO A LOCAL FORD DEALER MADE ME AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THE INTAKE MANIFOLD WAS DEFECTIVE, HOWEVER SINCE MY VEHICLE WAS PUT IN PRODUCTION IN DECEMBER 1999, I HAD MISSED THE RECALL DEADLINE.  I HAVE OWNED THIS VEHICLE FOR ALMOST 3 YEARS.  IN THAT TIME, I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION ON THE RECALL OR THE CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST FORD.  MY VEHICLE HAS HAD MAINTENANCE PERFORMED BY LOCAL FORD DEALERS AT WHICH TIME, I WAS NEVER MADE AWARE OF THE FAULTY PART.  I DON'T FEEL AS THOUGH THIS IS FAIR.  I WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THIS FACTORY DEFECT, NOR WARRANTY EXTENSION TO HAVE IT REPLACED.  IF I HAD BEEN AWARE, I WOULD HAVE HAD THE PART REPLACED.  NOW, BECAUSE OF FAILURE BY THE MANUFACTURER TO INFORM THE CONSUMER OF THIS DEFECTIVE PART AND THE RECALL, I AM FORCED TO PAY TO HAVE THIS DEFECTIVE PART REPLACED. THIS IS AN UNEXPECTED EXPENSE THAT WILL DEFINITELY CAUSE A STRAIN ON MY FAMILY FINANCES.  NOT ONLY THAT, UPON CALLING TO GET THE PRICE OF THE INTAKE MANIFOLD, I WAS INFORMED THAT I MISSED THE EXTENDED WARRANTY DEADLINE FOR MY VEHICLE (DECEMBER 2005).  I DO NOT THINK THIS IS FAIR.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF I CAN PURSUE ACTION TO HAVE MY EXPENSES REIMBURSED AND IF NOT, HOW CAN I PURSUE LEGAL ACTION.      RESPECTFULLY,    OTHA FARRIS, JR.  *NM",

A FORD TECHNICIAN TOLD ME DURING A RECENT REPAIR THAT IT NEEDED ANOTHER \"INTAKE MANIFOLD\" AND THAT IT WOULD COST ME $800 TO FIX IT AT THE DEALERSHIP.  I ASKED HIM IF IT WAS COVERED UNDER ANY WARRANTY AND I WAS TOLD NO.  THE OTHER NIGHT I WAS DRIVING DOWN I-35 HEADED TOWARDS DALLAS WHEN THE HIGH TEMPERATURE GAUGE STARTED GOING OFF.  I SLOWED DOWN AND PULLED OVER AND WHEN I OPENED THE HOOD, THERE WAS COOLANT SPRAYING FROM THE FRONT OF THE INTAKE MANIFOLD (NEAR THE THERMOSTAT).  I WAS ABLE TO COOL THE CAR DOWN BY PUTTING WATER IN THE RADIATOR.  HOWEVER, I HAD TO DO THIS EVERY COUPLE OF MILES BECAUSE THE WATER KEPT SHOOTING OUT OF THE TOP OF THE ENGINE.  I FINALLY GOT TO A WELL LIT AREA AND WAS ABLE TO ISOLATE THE LEAK.  THERE IS A GASH IN THE INTAKE MANIFOLD APPROXIMATELY 2 INCHES LONG.  I JUST CHECKED THE INTERNET FOR SOLUTIONS TO MY PROBLEM AND I FOUND OUT THAT FORD WAS SUED IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FOR THEIR DEFECTIVE PLASTIC INTAKE MANIFOLDS.  IT TURNS OUT, MY VEHICLE IS ONE OF THE VEHICLES THAT WAS COVERED IN THE CLASS ACTION SUIT.  (AND, IT WAS COVERED WHEN FORD TOLD ME IT WASN'T!!!)  SO I CALLED FORD TO HAVE THEM COME PICK UP MY VEHICLE AND REPAIR IT.  NOW THEY TELL ME I HAVE TO PAY FOR IT MYSELF!? COULD SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME?  I DON'T THINK I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT FORD ALREADY KNOWS IS A DEFECTIVE PART.  I MEAN, WHO WOULD MAKE ENGINE PARTS OUT OF PLASTIC ANYWAY?

STARTING WITH THE '92 MODEL YEAR AND IT'S AODE AND NOW THE 4R70W WHICH REPLACED THE AODE STARTING IN '98 FORD HAS KNOWN OF QUALITY ISSUES OF THEIR TRANSMISSIONS WHICH MANIFESTS ITSELF AS A HORRIBLE SHUDDER OR VIBRATION AS THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTS FROM 3RD GEAR GOING INTO 4TH GEAR (USUALLY TRANSITIONING FROM 40 TO 50 MPH!). I PURCHASED MY '99 CROWN VIC AND IT HAS PROVIDED ME RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION UNTIL JUST RECENTLY. I PICKED UP THIS HORRIBLE SHUDDER JUST 6 WEEKS PRIOR TO MY 3YR/36K FORD WARRANTY RUNNING OUT. WHEN THIS PROBLEM FIRST OCCURRED WITH HAVING JUST 22K ON THE ODOMETER AND 6 WEEKS LEFT ON THE WARRANTY I QUICKLY BROUGHT THE CAR IN FOR WARANTY WORK. UNIVERSAL FORD IN LONG ISLAND CITY, NY VALIDATED THAT INDEED THERE WAS A SHUDDER AND REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION WITH A REBUILT TRANSMISSION. I DROVE THE \"REPAIRED\" VEHICLE FROM NYC TO LEESBURG, VIRGINIA BUT ON THE RETURN TRIP THE SHUDDER CAME BACK WORSE THAN EVER. I MANAGED TO LIMP THE CAR BACK HOME AND THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN AT UNIVERSAL FORD SINCE. FOR THOSE OF YOU CONSIDERING A CROWN VICTORIA PERFORM YOUR \"DUE DILIGENCE\" AND VISIT SOME OF THE OTHER IMPARTIAL CROWN VIC WEB SITES (WWW.CORRAL.NET BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WWW.CROWNVIC.NET) SEARCHING ON \"TRANNY SHUDDER\". FORD HAS KNOWN OF THIS PROBLEM OVER 5 YEARS BUT HASN'T PUBLICALLY MADE IT WIDELY KNOWN ALONG WITH THEIR PLASTIC RESIN INTAKE MANIFOLD DEBACLE.

MANY OF THE SCREWS WERE NOT INSTALLED DURING MANUFACTURING PROCESS.  OTHER REMAINING SCREWS FAIL CAUSING LARGE OBJECTS TO FALL ONTO THE ROAD FROM THE COACH.
