I AM VERY GRATEFUL THAT THIS ONLY OCCURRED TO A 32 YEAR OLD MAN AND NOT ONE OF MY 4 SMALL CHILDREN (7MO-7 YEARS).  VWOA SHOULD DO THEIR RESEARCH AND SEE THAT HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF VW OWNERS HAVE HAD TO REPLACE DLMS ON MULTIPLE DOORS AT A COST OF AT LEAST $200+ EACH DOOR (MORE AT THE DEALERSHIP).  THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL FOR THE SAFETY FACTOR ALONE, LET ALONE THE INCONVENIENCE FACTOR OF HAVING TO REPLACE A DLM BECAUSE OF A $3 MICROSWITCH AT THE DOOR CLOSED SENSOR, OR 1 OF 6 BAD SOLDER JOINTS ON THE CIRCUIT BOARD INSIDE THE DOOR LOCK MODULE.  INFORMATION ON THE EXACT PROBLEM CAN BE FOUND ON MULTIPLE VW REPAIR SITES (TDICLUB.COM; VWVORTEX.COM; NEWBEETLE.ORG; ETC, ETC, ETC)  I DO UNDERSTAND THAT MY CAR IS 14 YEARS OLD, HOWEVER I HAVE HAD TO SPEND OVER $1000 FIXING VW FACTORY MISTAKES ON THIS CAR ALREADY.

THE CAR LURCHED FORWARD UNCONTROLLABLY AT AN ACCELERATED SPEED AND HIT A TRAILER AT MY PLACE OF WORK CAUSING DAMAGE TO BOTH THE BEETLE AND TRAILER. THE CAR WAS BROUGHT IN FOR SERVICING AT VALLEJO VOLKSWAGEN (1401 SONOMA BLVD, VALLEJO CA) THE PREVIOUS FRIDAY, SO IT WAS SURPRISING THAT THE CAR WOULD MALFUNCTION SO DANGEROUSLY AFTER HAVING JUST BEEN SERVICED. THE CAR WAS BROUGHT BACK TO VALLEJO VOLKSWAGEN MONDAY AFTERNOON. THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT IT SOUNDED LIKE THIS WAS DUE TO A FAULTY BRAKE LIGHTS SWITCH AND THAT THEY HAD SEEN THIS PROBLEM BEFORE. I LEFT THE CAR THERE OVERNIGHT AND THEY DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE MALFUNCTION WAS INDEED THE FAULTY BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH. THE PART IN QUESTION WAS SUBJECT TO A RECALL AND HAD APPARENTLY BEEN REPLACED IN MY CAR IN DECEMBER OF 2003. VALLEJO VOLKSWAGEN DISAVOWED ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCIDENT AND ATTRIBUTED THE MALFUNCTION TO NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR OF THE BREAK LIGHT SWITCH. HOWEVER, IF THIS PART IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO BREAKDOWN DUE TO NORMAL WEAR AND TARE THEN IT SHOULD BE INSPECTED WHEN THE CAR WAS SERVICED. VALLEJO VOLKSWAGEN REPLACED THE DEFECTIVE SWITCH AND HAD THE AUDACITY TO CHARGE ME FOR DOING SO. NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS SITUATION AND FEEL LIKE BOTH VALLEJO VOLKSWAGEN AND VOLKSWAGEN ARE LIABLE FOR THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE ACCIDENT AND ARE LIABLE FOR PLACING ME IN SUCH A DANGEROUS AND UNCONTROLLED SITUATION. INDEED, I AM EXTREMELY RELIEVED THAT THE CAR HIT THE TRAILER, AND GOD FORBID NOT ANOTHER HUMAN BEING WHICH COULD HAVE EASILY OCCURRED HAD I BEEN IN A CROWDED PARKING LOT. ADDENDUM: I RECENTLY FOUND OUT THAT AS OF MAY 30TH 2006 THERE HAS BEEN A RECALL OF THE RECALLED BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH.  *NM",

        "summary": "THIS VEHICLE HAS HAD A SERIES OF PROBLEMS SINCE I HAVE OWNED IT. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A VOLKSWAGEN ENTHUSIAST. SO WHEN I SAW THE NEW BEETLES I WAS NATURALLY EXCITED AND COULDN'T WAIT TO OWN ONE. WHAT I EXPECTED WAS VOLKSWAGENS USUAL EXCELLENT QUALITY AND VALUE FOR MONEY. WHAT I GOT WAS A VEHICLE THAT NOT ONLY IS AN INCONVENIENCE TO DRIVE, BUT IS ALSO A SAFETY CONCERN. THIS VEHICLE HAS HAD AT LEAST 8 MAJOR DEFECTS. I CALL THEM DEFECTS BECAUSE SO MANY OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR ISSUES WITH THEIR NEW BEETLES. KEEP IN MIND THE VEHICLE IS REGULARLY MAINTAINED, AND IS ONLY AT 97,000 MILES. 1. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON AND VEHICLE STALLS OR CUTS OUT ON A REGULAR BASIS. 2. THE LOW BEAMS ON MY HEADLIGHTS ALWAYS BURN OUT. I CHANGE THE LIGHTS AND THEY JUST BURN OUT AGAIN. I ALWAYS HAVE TO DRIVE INSTEAD WITH MY HIGH BEAMS ON. 3. MY DRIVER SIDE AND PASSENGER SIDE WINDOWS HAVE FALLEN INTO MY DOORS. MEANING THAT THEY WONT ROLL UP, A LOUD, NOISE CAN BE HEARD WHEN YOU TRY. I WAS TOLD BY VOLKSWAGEN THAT THEY WERE \"AWARE\" OF THE PROBLEM. THEY EVEN TOLD ME THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY USED PLASTIC CLIPS TO HOLD THE WINDOWS AND THEY ARE NOW REPLACING WITH METAL CLIPS. FINE AND GOOD, BUT WHILE MY WINDOWS WERE DOWN MY SEATS BECAME SEVERELY STAINED. (THEY STAIN EASY) WHO'S GOING  PAY FOR THAT??? 4. THE WINDOW SWITCH THAT CONTROLS THE WINDOWS GOING UP AND DOWN BROKE OFF IN MY HAND. 5. THE RADIO TRIES TO LOAD A TAPE WHEN THERE ISN'T ONE. HOOD LATCH BROKE, HAS TO BE OPENED WITH SCREWDRIVER NOW. THANKS VWOA!! 6. HEATER MOTOR TURNS UP AND DOWN ON ITS OWN 7. ENGINE HOLDS HIGH RPMS IN HIGHWAY, RAPID IOL CONSUMPTION. 8 REVERSE LIGHTS MALFUNCTIONED. QUESTIONS VWOA?

I FOUND OUT LATER THAT VW HAS NO RECORD OF EVER SERVICING OR EVEN SEEING THE VW UNTIL 1 APRIL, 2003! DURING THE MONTHS OF FEBRUARY AND MARCH, 2003 I STILL EXPERIENCED THE VEHICLE OVERHEATING AND EACH TIME I CALLED AMIR, I WOULD FOLLOW UP WITH A VISIT TO TORRANCE NISSAN.

THERE WERE MANY TIMES I TOLD THE DEALERSHIP THAT I NO LONGER WANTED THIS CAR AND EVEN SUBMITTED IT IN WRITING ON 15 APRIL, 2003.  ON 1 APRIL, 2003 I TOOK THE BEETLE TO VOLKSWAGEN MYSELF AND HAD IT FIXED, BUT THE WATER PUMP BROKE AGAIN AND WAS REPLACED ON 4-9-03. THREE DAYS LATER, THE CAR WAS GETTING HOT. I TOLD BOTH VOLKSWAGEN AND TORRANCE NISSAN THAT I NO LONGER WANT THIS CAR! I HAVE PROOF OF ALL THE REPAIRS PERFORMED AND STILL IT OVERHEATS! ON 12 APRIL, 2003 I TOOK THE CAR ONCE MORE TO VOLKSWAGEN TO THOROUGHLY CHECK IT OUT AND THEY CALLED THEIR TECHNICAL SUPPORT. A FEW DAYS LATER THEY FOUND A CRACKED HEAD ON THE ENGINE BLOCK. TO TOP IT OFF, I HAD A CAR ACCIDENT ON 28 APRIL, 2003 ON MY WAY TO WORK AND HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE LONG BEACH HONDA BODY SHOP. LATER THAT NIGHT THE CAR CAUGHT FIRE AND WAS BURNED DOWN WITH 3 OTHER CARS IN THE BODY SHOP.

APPARENTLY THE BATTERY WAS FALLING OUT OF THE CAR AT 13,000 MILES.   A FEW MONTHS LATER I HEARD A NOISE AND SLIPPING WITHIN THE TRANSMISSION.  AS IT TURNED OUT, ENGINE COOLANT HAD LEAKED INTO THE TRANSMISSION AND A REBUILT WAS PUT IN.  WITHIN A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE REBUILT WAS PUT IN, IT WAS MAKING SOME NOISE AND IT HAD INTERMITTENT LURCHING.  I COMPLAINED TO VW OF AMERICA AND THE DEALERSHIP.  THEY TOOK CARE OF THE NOISE AND SAID THEY WOULD BE UNABLE TO HELP WITH THE LURCH PROBLEM.  I WAS IN AN ACCIDENT A MONTH AND A HALF AFTER GETTING THE REBUILT.  I WENT INTO A POLE SIDEWAYS.  I HAD AN INDEPENDENT TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST TEST DRIVE IT AFTER THE CAR WAS REPAIRED.  HE REPORTED AN UNUSUALLY LONG PAUSE FOR ENGAGEMET.  I BELIEVE THAT WHEN I WAS IN A ROLL FORWARD MOTION AND WOULD PUT MY FOOT TO THE GAS, IT WOULD NOT ENGAGE PROPERLY AND LURCHED.  THE REASON IT WAS INTERMITTENT , IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT SOMETIMES WHEN YOU WOULD BE IN A ROLLFORWARD MOTION IT WOULD BE IN GEAR AND NOT LURCH.  IF IT WAS NOT IN GEAR DUE TO THE LONG PAUSE, YOU WOULD GET A LURCHING MOVEMENT.  MY FIRST TRANSMISSION NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM.  THERE IS A POTENTIAL DESIGN FLAW WITH THIS TRANSMISSION.  WHEN I WAS TALKING TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AT COMMONWEALTH, WITH MY FIRST TRANSMISSION, HE HAD STATED THEY WERE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE JETTA TRANSMISSIONS.*AK",

THEY REPLACED THE HUBCAPS, BUT THE PROBLEM WOULD CONTINUOUSLY HAPPEN.  FINALLY I TOOK IT BACK AGAIN FOR SERVICE AND DEMANDED THAT THIS PROBLEM BE FIXED.

THE OTHER PROBLEMS, ARE THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD KNOCK AND MAKE LOUD NOISES.  THE FIRST TIME IT WAS BROUGHT IN, I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR, AND THAT THE CAR WAS CLASSIFIED AS SAFE.  IT STARTED HAPPENING AGAIN, AND THEY LOOKED AND SAID IT WAS A \"DEFECT\" IN THAT YEARS MODEL.  SO THEY REPLACED IT, \"BECAUSE MY CAR WAS STILL UNDER GUARANTEE\".  THIS PROBLEM HAS STARTED ALL OVER AGAIN, I TOOK IT IN FOR SERVICE JUST RECENTLY AND THEY SAID IT'S BECAUSE OF THE DAMP WEATHER WE'VE BEEN HAVING.  JUST YESTERDAY I BROUGHT THE CAR IN FOR TURNING OFF ON THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY.  THE SERVICE CENTER WAS NOT HELPFUL.  THEY WOULD NOT GIVE ME A LOANER AND WOULD NOT EVEN GIVE ME A RIDE HOME OR WORK BECAUSE I WORKED IN THE BRONX.  MY CAR IS STILL NOT READY, AND THE COMMENT WAS WHEN I CALLED IF MY CAR WOULD BE READY TODAY WAS, \"WELL YOU COULD TAKE IT BACK THE WAY YOU BROUGHT IT IN.\"  GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I'VE HAVE BEEN VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE CAR AND THE SERVICE CENTER.  I WAS TOLD THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS NOTHING THAT I HAD CAUSED, IT IS AGAIN ANOTHER \"DEFECT\" AND IT WILL BE REPLACED FREE OF CHARGE ONLY BECAUSE I'M STILL UNDER WARRANTY UNTIL 8/27/00.
