THERE ARE TWO BARS ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT THAT KEEP THE BACKREST IN PLACE.  WHILE RIDING APPROXIMATELY 25 MPH, THE TWO SIDE UPRIGHT BARS RANDOMLY FAILED AND CAUSED THE BACKREST TO COME OUT OF PLACE.  THE CONTACT CALLED THE MANUFACTURER AND HARLEY DAVIDSON SENT A REPLACEMENT.  FOUR YEARS AFTER THE REPLACEMENT WAS RECEIVED, THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE UPRIGHT HANDLE BARS FAILED WHILE RIDING 50 MPH.  THE REAR PASSENGER NEARLY FELL FROM THE VEHICLE.  THE REAR PASSENGER SUSTAINED A CUT TO HER HAND.  THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE SECOND FAILURE BECAUSE THE CONTACT FELT THAT THE ISSUE WAS NOT HANDLED PROPERLY THE FIRST TIME.  THE FAILURE MILEAGE FOR THE FIRST INCIDENT WAS 45,000 AND CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 68,000.  THE CONSUMER SENT THE BACKREST TO THE MANUFACTURER AND FOUND THAT THE BACKREST HAD A STRESS ON THE LEFT SIDE.
