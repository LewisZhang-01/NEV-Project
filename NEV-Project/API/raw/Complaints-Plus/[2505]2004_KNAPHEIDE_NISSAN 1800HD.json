IT IS BECOMING WORSE AND HAVE BEEN TOLD MANY THINGS FROM DIFFERENT MECHANICS. AFTER VIEWING THE MANY COMPLAINTS I AM NOT AWARE THIS IS A CONCERN FOR NISSAN TO FOLLOW UP ON. I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO TRADE IN THE VEHICLE BUT BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD A DOWN PAYMENT NISSAN WILL NOT DO SO. HOWEVER I NOW MAY BE LOOKING AT BEING STUCK ON THE ROAD, WASTING MONEY ON A LOST CAUSE OR HURT IF ANYTHING HAPPENS AND IF IT CAN BE PREVENTED, THAT IS WHAT NISSAN'S CONCERN SHOULD BE. I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP NOT ONLY MY DAUGHTER SAFE BUT OTHERS ON THE ROAD AS WELL.  *TR",
