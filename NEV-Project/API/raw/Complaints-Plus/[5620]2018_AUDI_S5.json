IN ADDITION, THE CAR'S LANE ASSISTANCE MECHANISM IS NOT ACCURATE AT TIMES AND COULD HAVE CAUSED ACCIDENTS SEVERAL TIMES.

MOREOVER, THE AUDI SENSOR WHICH DETECTS OBJECT AND BRAKES FOR THE DRIVER DOESN'T WORK TOO WELL. FOR INSTANCE, WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN AT AN INTERSECTION, IT WILL MIS-CALCULATE THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND WILL BRAKE AND STALL THE CAR IN THE MIDDLE OF INTERSECTION. ALSO, THE AUDI SENSOR WRONGLY DETECTS THE OBJECT AROUND THE CAR SUCH AS ELEVATED SIDEWALK CURBS OR FIRE HYDRANTS AND IT RANDOMLY AUTO-SLAM THE BRAKES EVEN WHILE THE CAR IS MOVING AT 30-40MPH.    THE CAR WAS IN THE DEALERSHIP REPAIR SHOP AT LEAST 5 TIMES TO ATTEMPT TO FIX THE ISSUE. THE DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE \"MOD BOX\" TWICE, WHICH SEEM TO FIX MOST OF THE SENSOR RELATED ISSUES BUT ISSUES STILL ARISE AND I AM SKEPTICAL AND AFRAID OF DRIVING THIS CAR.  *TR",
