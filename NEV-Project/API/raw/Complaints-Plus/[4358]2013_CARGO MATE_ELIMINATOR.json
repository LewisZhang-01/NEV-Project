THIS RESULTED IN THE ATTACHED SIDE-MARKER/CLEARANCE LIGHT TO ALSO BE TORN FROM FROM THE VEHICLE RESULTING IN A SHORT IN THE LIGHTING HARNESS. RIGHT SIDE FENDER ALSO CAME LOOSE A FEW MONTHS LATER, AND HAD TO BE REMOVED BEFORE IT FELL OFF. FENDERS ARE HELD ON BY ONLY SELF TAPPING SHEET METAL SCREW, AND DOUBLE SIDED TAPE. THIS RESULTS IN THE SCREW EITHER LOOSENING, OR BEING PULLED OUT OF THE SHEET METAL. I BELIEVE THE ROOT CAUSE IF THE ISSUE IS THE SELF TAPPING SCREWS. SEVERAL OF THESE WERE SCREWED STRAIGHT INTO THE SHEET METAL SIDE, WHERE NO SUPPORTS WERE PRESENT. ALSO THESE TYPES OF SCREWS STRIP VERY EASILY AND ARE A POOR CHOICE TO USE TO HOLD SUCH A VITAL COMPONENT ONTO THE VEHICLE.  *TR",
