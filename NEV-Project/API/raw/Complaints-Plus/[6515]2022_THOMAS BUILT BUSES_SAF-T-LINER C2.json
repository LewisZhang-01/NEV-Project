        "summary": "This is a preventative complaint. In my opinion, all the Thomas Saf-T-Liner C2 school buses have a serious blind spot due to the location of the driver's side mirrors. When pulling up to an intersection, or stop sign, the driver has to bend forward and backward to see past the mirror for oncoming traffic. I brought this issue up earlier with the manufacturer representative, and he said they would look into it, but no changes have been made or any retro-fit kits to move mirrors.",
