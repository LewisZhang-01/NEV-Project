We took it to a Mazda dealer and they quickly identified the issue as a failing transmission. As a result I was able to find that a service bulletin aligned with this issue  (TSB No. 0500414) and confirmed this with the dealer. This service bulletin indicates a manufacturing issue but only applied a warranty of 6 years or 60,000 miles. Yes, our car is over the 6 yrs and only 800 miles over the 60,000 miles, however, my concern is that this is a known issue that clearly becomes a safety issue. We got a price from the dealer of $4,500 for a new transmission so I took it to a transmission shop for a 2nd opinion. They confirmed the failing transmission and indicated the car should not be driven for safety reasons. They said the transmission is in bad shape and when it fails the car will just stop creating a very unsafe condition. They are able to find a used transmission and install it for an estimate of $2,700 but I believe this should be covered by Mazda due to the safety concerns. I have no choice to proceed with this replacement but hope that you can help to get Mazda's attention and have them stand behind this and cover this cost.",

AS THE YEAR PROGRESSED, THE HEADLIGHT FLASHING, WHICH PRESENTS ITSELF ONLY UPON BRAKING OR DECELERATION, BECAME MARKEDLY INCREASED AND BRIGHTER, INCLUDING THE DASHBOARD INFORMATION SYSTEMS WINDOW INSIDE.

SINCE I HAD EXTENDED WARRANTY, THROUGH A PRIVATE COMPANY, BUT ONLY UNTIL 60,000/5 YEARS, I RUSHED TO MAKE TIME FOR THE MECHANIC TO RECEIVE AUTHORIZATION AND REPLACE THE ALTERNATOR, WHICH HE DID, AND MY CAR RUNS GREAT.  THERE REMAINS, THOUGH, THE PROBLEM WITH THE HEADLIGHTS FLASHING.  SINCE THE MECHANIC DID RESET THE COMPUTER, WE WERE STUMPED.  THEN MY HUSBAND FOUND  A SERVICE BULLETIN FROM MAZDA DEALING WITH THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE, STATING THAT THE CAR MUST GO TO THE DEALER BECAUSE ONLY THE DEALER CAN RESET ALL THE PARTS OF THE COMPUTER.  I THEN CONTACTED MAZDA, BUT HAVE YET TO RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  I DO NOT FEEL THAT I SHOULD BE MADE TO  PAY FOR THIS ADJUSTMENT/REPAIR SINCE MAZDA APPARENTLY IS WELL AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL CAR.

I ARRIVED AT A TURN ONTO ANOTHER CITY STREET, COMPLETED THE TURN, AND AS I BEGAN TO ACCELERATE, MY VEHICLE FELT AS IF IT HAD SHIFTED INTO NEUTRAL ON ITS OWN. AS I PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR, THE RPMS WOULD RISE BUT THE VEHICLE WAS ONLY COASTING DOWN THE STREET. I CHECKED THE GEAR SHIFTER, AND IT WAS STILL LOCATED IN THE DRIVE POSITION (AUTOMATIC) I THEN CHECKED THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER AND  IT SHOWED DRIVE WITH NO MAINTENANCE OR PROBLEM LIGHTS ILLUMINATED. I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER SHIFTED THE VEHICLE INTO PARK, THEN BACK INTO DRIVE. EVERYTHING SEEMED NORMAL, SO I CONTINUED DRIVING DOWN THE SAME STREET AND ABOUT 10 SECONDS LATER THE SAME ISSUE HAPPENED. I FOLLOWED THE SAME PROCESS AS BEFORE AND THEN CONTINUED TO MY DESTINATION. I BELIEVE THAT THIS ISSUE IS CAUSED BY SOMETHING FAULTY WITH THE TRANSMISSION OR RELATED COMPONENTS. IT SEEMS TO HAVE DONE THIS RANDOMLY OR WHEN SHIFTING INTO DIFFERENT GEARS. ALSO SEEMS FAULTY AS THEIR ARE NO OTHER INDICATORS OF AN ISSUE. I FEEL THAT THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS ISSUE AS IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN DURING MY TRANSIT TO WORK EACH DAY (VIA HIGHWAY, TRAVELING 65 MPH) THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ACCIDENT IS GREAT I BELIEVE. I HAVE CONDUCTED SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AND MY FINDINGS INDICATE SEVERAL OTHER OWNERS OF THE SAME VEHICLE HAVE HAD THIS SAME ISSUE WITH THEIR TRANSMISSION, COSTING THEM UNNECESSARY DOLLARS AS WELL AS RISKING SAFETY BY SOMETHING I BELIEVE TO BE FAULTY EQUIPMENT.  *TR",

ON APPROXIMATELY 10/10/2014 SHE PICKED UP OUR 10 YEAR OLD BOY AND WHEN HE TRIED TO BUCKLE THE SEATBELT IT DID NOT WORK. AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS MY WIFE THEN GOT IN THE PASSENGERS SIDE TO SEE IF SHE COULD GET IT BUCKLED. SHE COULD NOT. AT THIS POINT SHE ALSO NOTICED THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG HAD DISENGAGED, EVEN WITH HER IN THE FRONT SEAT. BEING WELL OVER THE MINIMUM WEIGHT TO ACTIVATE WE KNEW THIS WAS NOT THE PROBLEM WITH THE AIRBAG. UPON RESEARCHING THE INTERNET IT HAS COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT THERE ARE MANY CASES OF OTHERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. ALL OF WHICH WERE TURNED DOWN BY MAZDA FOR ANY KIND OF REMEDY. I SPOKE WITH [XXX], A SERVICE ADVISOR FOR NELSON MAZDA IN TULSA, OK, AND WHEN ASKED IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THEY COULD DO WITH OUT CHARGING ME BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY OF THE SAFETY ISSUES THIS PROBLEM CAUSES HE BASICALLY JUST SAID NO.  I DID BUY THE CAR AT ANOTHER DEALER BUT LIVE TOO FAR AWAY TO SET UP ANYTHING WITH THEM. I THOUGHT MAYBE ONE MAZDA DEALER WOULD STAND UP FOR ANOTHER JUST TO MAKE A GOOD SHOWING FOR THE MAZDA NAME.
