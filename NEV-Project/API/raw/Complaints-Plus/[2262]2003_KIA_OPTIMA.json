WELL, THIS EVENING, ENROUTE TO PICK MY DAUGHTER FROM THE DAYCARE FACILITY, I SAW TRAFFIC STOPPED, WENT TO SLOW UP BY APPLYING BRAKES AND GUESS WHAT?  NO BRAKES! THIS DID NOT HAPPEN ALL THE TIME, BUT INTERMITTENTLY, NOW CAUSED ME TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE THE BRAKES DID NOT WORK! THE REPAIR SHOP AT THE DEALERSHIP IS THE ONE WHO SAID IT WAS ALL TAKEN CARE OF, HOWEVER, AS YOU CAN SEE , IT IS NOT TAKEN CARE OF AS THE BRAKES FAILED!! THE BRAKES DID NOT ENGAGE, I WAS GOING TO TRY TO GO IN THE LEFTHAND LANE OF THE TWO LANE HIGHWAY ON MY SIDE OF THE ROAD, HOWEVER THERE WAS A CAR ALREADY IN POSITION ON THAT SIDE AND THE CURB, GRASS AND THEN A PIZZA HUT ON MY RIGHT, LEAVING ME NO WHERE TO GO BUT UNDER THE BUMPER OF A PICK UP. IT PUSHED THE GRILL INTO THE RADIO, THEREFORE THE HOOD IS BUCKLED, THE BUMPER DESTROYED AND  CAR WILL BE TOTALED BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY AS IT IS COST MORE TO REPAIR AS IT ALSO TORE OFF SIDE STRIP AND OTHER PARTS ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE CAR. THE LEFT HAND TURN SIGNAL BLINKS TWICE AS FAST AS IT SHOULD AS I CHECKED OUT EVERYTHING AS THE POLICE OFFICER SAID IT WAS DRIVABLE. I DROVE IT HOME VERY SLOWLY WITH MY DAD IN A CAR BEHIND ME TO MAKE SURE I DID NOT LEAK ANY FLUID AND ALSO TO MAKE SURE I GOT HOME ALRIGHT WITH MY 8 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AFTER WE PICKED HER UP AT DAYCARE. THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED SO WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE 2003 BRAKES ON KIA OPTIMAS?

I THOUGHT I MENTIONED THIS TO DEALER PRIOR TO 60K MILES WHILE GETTING ANOTHER SERVICE DONE AND WAS TOLD THE PROBLEM COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED, BUT THERE IS NO RECORD OF IT PER DEALER. IN ANY CASE I BROUGHT THE CAR TO DEALER 3/6/07 FOR OIL CHANGE AND ASKED THEY CHECK DOOR LOCKS WHICH WERE ONLY WORKING INTERMITTENTLY - PER THE INVOICE THEY CHECKED LOCK RELAYS, DISCONNECTED  AND CHECKED SWITCH, CHECKED GROUND  AT JB-07, 0 OHMS , ETCS MODULE ALL OK. THE MILEAGE AT THAT POINT WAS 67288. I WAS TOLD THE ELECTRICAL WARRANTY  EXPIRED AT 60K. I DID NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO GET IT REPAIRED. BY 10/24/07, THE FRONT PASSENGER DOOR COULD NO LONGER BE OPENED WITH DRIVER DOOR SWITCH OR REMOTE, AND KEY ENTRY TOOK SEVERAL MINUTES WHILE TURNING THE KEY WHILE THE DOOR UNLOCKED THEN LOCKED AS I PULLED UP THE HANDLE.  I WAS CHARGED $35.55 TO DIAGNOSE THAT THERE WAS A POSSIBLE WIRING ETAC OR RELAY PROBLEM NOT  COVERED BY WARRANTY - COST OF REPAIR WOULD BE OVER $1000.  NOW THE COVER TO THE PASSENGER DOOR KEY HOLE JUST CAME OFF PROBABLY DUE TO THE EXCESSIVE KEY PLAY NEEDED TO OPEN THE DOOR.
