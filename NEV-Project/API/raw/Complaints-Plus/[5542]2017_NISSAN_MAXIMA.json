That clearly is a safety concern that Nissan has been avoiding.  However, they are now re-drilling a hole and attaching a new version of the molding.  At the owners cost!!!  It wasn't an issue but now you are changing the way you attach the new ones?  Very odd and they state it's not a safety concern.  I beg to differ if you are the car on the highway behind someone's that is loose and comes flying at you.  I have read numerous blogs of owners complaining of the same issue.  I think we need to get this addressed or see about a class action lawsuit because the way Nissan is reacting to this isn't right.",
