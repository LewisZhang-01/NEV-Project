This in my opinion is a safety hazard as this is the structure of the camper and can separate at anytime which could cause slide issues while traveling on the road if there was too much weight for the frame.   These camper's have two large slides on one side. The concern is too much weight causing structure issues which could break traveling down the road if it were to break loose.",
