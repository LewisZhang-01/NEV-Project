I will be getting my windshield replaced by Safelite as to not place my passengers at risk. There have been previous lawsuits regarding Outback and Legacy models regarding defective windshield, which have since settled, although the year models are from 2015-2016, it would be interesting if they continue to persist for newer models such as 2020, 2021, 2022 since there are still many complaints and cracked windshields being reported.

Roughly a minute after starting the vehicle and turning on the air conditioning, I drove a distance of about 100 ft and heard a really loud snap, but initially didn't see the cause of the sound. About 2 seconds later, a crack quickly spread horizontally from the driver's side edge at mid height of the windshield until reaching the center of the windshield. After continuing to drive the vehicle, the crack began to spread vertically for about 6 inches, and then spread further horizontally to the right by another 6 inches, forming an S-shape. No damage or chips were known to have been previously inflicted on the windshield and the glass was visibly intact prior the cracking event.   Because the crack was positioned almost exactly at eye level, visibility was noticeably distorted. If the crack and associated snapping sound had occurred while the car was being driven in actual traffic on a road or freeway, the startling nature of the event and loud volume of the snapping sound would likely put someone driving the vehicle at risk of reacting in a hazardous fashion and result in a crash. Furthermore, since the Subaru Outback's forward collision warning,  automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, and lane keeping assistance all operate through a camera-based system that requires a clear view through the windshield, the crack posed a risk of malfunction of these systems.

This crack is the second such spontaneous crack that has occurred with this same vehicle. The first crack occurred in the original windshield in June 2021, after which the original windshield was replaced with an OEM windshield. This second cracking event occurred with the OEM replacement windshield. About 30 minutes into driving the vehicle at freeway speeds (65 mph), a crack with a total length of about 10 inches (5 inches vertical, 5 inches horizontal) formed spontaneously mid-length on the windshield beginning from the bottom edge of the glass. The formation of the crack occurred quickly and was associated with a loud snapping sound. The path of the crack traveled through the location of a small (2mm x 2mm) chip in the glass located approximately 2 inches from the bottom edge of the glass. This chip in the glass occurred at least 2 months prior to the cracking event and was the result of an impact from a small rock (about 1cm x 1cm). No additional damage or impact force had occurred on the chipped location between the creation of the chip and the cracking event. If the crack had been larger and the associated snapping sound louder, the startling nature of the event and loud volume of the snapping sound would likely put someone driving the vehicle at risk of reacting in a hazardous fashion and result in a crash.

There were no cars within 300 feet of my car so I doubt a rock was kicked up to hit my windshield.  I believe windshield is defective.  Will have it replaced again.  Although this repair is covered by my insurance, repeat claims like this will cause insurance rates to go up for all consumers.",

Subaru dealership attempted to tell me the battery was fine but the service advisor noted it was starting up sluggishly. Service did a full charge. Subaru's own website recommends driving the car at least a couple times a month, which is what I've done, but the battery still drains within two weeks.  The Subaru dealership further told me that the battery has a memory and \"learned\" my driving habits (I purchased the car prior to the pandemic) and that is why the battery is not keeping a charge since I'm not driving it as often as they think I should. They also told me that I should disconnect the battery if I have to leave the car at an airport, for example if I go on vacation. That is absurd. The service advisor further told me that the warranty would likely not cover the battery replacement because they believe I'm not driving the car enough.  I am concerned that the battery not holding a strong and sufficient charge will cause the car to not be able to restart at a traffic stop if I have not remembered to disengage the fuel-saving feature. While I carry a jump starting kit, I would need to get out in the road and try to hurriedly jump the car.

Since we owned it we noticed that it was often difficult to start and my wife claims that when cornering, it hesitates like it is going to stall.  This week she was visiting a client and the car was TOTALLY dead...no electrical activity at all.  No door locks, no lights, no seat adjustment, no driver identification....I thought it was a dead FOB so when I went to pick her up I brought the spare FOB.  It did not work either.  We live in a rural community and if the car is not able to be operated, there is very little in the way of support at night.  The car is now at the dealer.  BUT I did some research and realized that this is a frequent occurrence and there are 2 law suits in progress.  The remedy that Subaru is telling its dealers is to replace the battery...but it is likely that the battery is the cause of the electrical faults.  And there are no recalls even though my wife claims a problem when cornering.  Please add my wife's name to your investigation.

The dealer had the car for about five hours to diagnose the cause of the discharge. They found no trouble with the electrical system and said the battery and alternator functioned normally. The dealer found no adverse electrical leaks causing the battery to discharge overnight. The dealer suggested that we weren't driving the vehicle enough. They sold and installed a trickle charge device to alleviate the problem. The trickle charger has not helped.  Safety concerns:  we have to jump start the car EVERY day. We have to remember to disable the auto stop/start option to prevent the car from shutting the engine off during idle while waiting for a stop light to change. On numerous occasions we must exit the vehicle, attach a jump start battery pack to the car's battery and start it as traffic is whizzing by. We have been in remote areas where mobile/cell service is unavailable to call for help and only because we have the jump start battery pack are we able to start the the car.

This problem has occurred numerous times over the past several months. It happens without any predictability and I have not been able to find a common factor that triggers it. In May it happened once on a 4 hour drive west, but on the return trip it happened 4 times in a 2 hour window. The problem did not occur again until the first week of June and happened multiple times over a 3 day period. The software for the car has been recalled and reinstalled twice and the problem still occurs without warning or explanation. I have reported the issue in mid-August to Subaru's customer service and was told \"a software update\" was 2 weeks away. I do not believe this report from their customer service because no other documentation was provided other than a call back. I followed-up with a call back and an email to Subaru asking for more details for which I have not gotten an answer. The incidence of it happening on Aug 20, 2021 occurred as I was entering into traffic from Baggage Road to Hwy 220 South in Rockingham County, NC. The system rebooted as I was entering traffic and created a distraction at a crucial moment I was crossing 4 lanes to turn left to proceed south on Hwy 220. Presently the system's issues seem to be limited to a reboot of Bluetooth, radio and all safety related systems. If the system had triggered a shutdown of the car or if the safety systems had caused the car to stop I would have been in the middle of a US Highway with traffic approaching from both directions at 60+mph. I am disappointed by Subaru for not addressing this issue with a formal company statement and promises of an update have not materialized.",

When this occurs all of the safety systems/HVAC/Rear Camera/Radio/Navigation systems all will fail with the associated warning lights.  The car now has approx 9000 miles, this appears to be random occurrences about every 200-250 miles.  Dealer states that they are aware of the problem and was told to contact back late June/early July that SOA was going to release a software fix.  Well time has passed and nothing has occurred.  When driving this car and the failure occurs all of the safety systems are totally inoperable thus the computerized safety systems are not functional.  So, far I have been able to maintain full control of the car.  The time for the systems to comeback online is highly variable and sometimes I have to stop, and turn the car off for approximately 10 minutes to have the systems return to being functional.  For example, the automated cruise control if in operation will fail to operate, the backup camera will be inoperable, the side space warning will fail, lane assist will fail, and so on for all of the safety systems that this particular car has will all fail.  Fortunately,  I have been able to safely find a safe place to stop, but what happens when this failure occurs and there is not a place to stop/pull over to rest the car/computer.  I can't be the only owner/driver that is having this problem(s) they are all interrelated when the master computer shuts down all of the other systems then follow.  It is only a matter of time that a potential crash with associated injury and or loss of life can potentially occur.  Dealer is unable to replicate and therefore unable to repair/replace parts.  Once this failure can be rectified/corrected this is a wonderful car.  At this point, I am unable to determine the cause nor am I able to prevent these failures.",

Subaru assured me that the battery was simply not properly charged and the car was returned. Then a couple of months later I left my car unproven in my driveway while I was out of town for 2 weeks and my car would not start.  I again had it towed to my Subaru dealership where Subaru ran the same test and told me that they replaced a bad battery.  They also told me that when they jump started the car in their shop they discovered that the interior dome light had been left on while I was out of town. The later is inconsistent with my experience as I loaded my Subaru Forester sitting right beside my Outback in the dark before leaving town.  Had the dome light been left on, I would have noticed the light as I packed my car.  In addition their test of this battery later showed this battery to need to be replaced. My safety concern is I cannot trust this car to start.  Had I driven my 2020 Outback to the airport for a 14 day trip rather than my 2020 Forester, I would have found myself on the 4th level of the terminal parking lot with a dead battery upon my return.  This is the second time that I have had to have this car towed to the Subaru dealership to have the battery serviced under warranty.

In all instances the windshield has cracked spontaneously without impact on either the passenger side or  at the bottom of the windshield, near the middle. The cracks continue to propagate quickly while driving or when parked overnight, until the crack terminates on the side opposite the crack.  This spontaneous cracking, is a safety hazard in that it not only compromises the integrity of the glass, but also can affect the Subaru EyeSight safety vision system, by impairing camera view thru the windshield if a crack propagates through the cameras field of view.  This new instance means that in less than 10,000 miles I have had 4 windshields in this car.  I have never had this occur on any vehicle I have owned previously, nor to our 2017 Outback.

I coincidentally had a jumper battery unit in the car and was able to start it with the external battery jumper. When I drove the car the 30 minutes to my home, I found that the battery had not charged at all.   This meant that until Subaru fixed this on warranty, I could drive the car but would have to raise the hood, hook up the external jumper unit, start the car, disconnect the jumpers, close the hood and finally drive where I was going. This procedure grows old after doing it repeatedly to shop for supplies after being away for 4 weeks.   The Subaru dealer fit me in the following day and confirmed the battery had been destroyed by the car sitting unused for 4 weeks. He recommended that I always leave a small charger on it whenever it will not be used for 2 weeks or more! That would have been impossible at the airport parking lot. I have taken this car on very many severe backcountry drives where failure to start when it's time to leave could be problematic or even fatal. Whatever is the problem should be fixed. If the new battery will fail the same way, it should be replaced with a battery that won't, on warranty. If it's the charging system that's at fault, then the faulty design should be corrected.",

The service department then said that I must have bumped the rear dome light and that drained the battery.

I drove more than 50 miles to the VA Hospital in Tampa. I stopped my car a line for a pre-op COVID check. I turned the car off 5-10 minutes and when the line of cars moved again and I went to crank the car up again, it would not start. I got out and called Subaru Roadside Assistance and got locked out. I used my hidden key in the Fab. Subaru brought a gallon of gas which was not the solution and then he told me to try to start the vehicle. He said the battery was drained (which is strange because had just drove fifty miles to th location and the alternator should be keeping the battery full). He the  connected  a battery power pack jumper and successfully jumped the car. I have faithfully waited and been patient with Cannon Subaru explanations and reasons to no avail. I explained to a sales representative that my 2020 Subaru Outback Limited is a Lemon and I want to exchange it for a new car (Under the Lemon Law) or get my money refunded (I paid almost $37,000 cash for the vehicle).

I'm hoping filling this out will get the issue further investigated since it's a common enough problem.",

A picture taken immediately after bug impact is attached below.  The crack propagated in a Y-formation and needed replacement.  Although cicadas have recently begun coming out, this was not an overly large bug.  It was approximately the size of a lightning bug, as I saw it hit.

This has been a problem on an ongoing basis since the purchase of the vehicle. This has been \"repaired\" multiple times by the dealer under the direction of Subaru. There was a recall earlier this year that was supposed to correct the problem it added some functionality, but primarily this recall reprogramming of the electronics was supposed to correct the blacking out of electronics and the disabling of the safety systems. The recall reprogramming has not corrected the problem. When I complained to Subaru they suggested that I take a video of the failure when it happened. I explained that this was not possible because I was driving at 70 MPH when it happened and could not just grab my phone and start a video while driving on I-95. Last week I was able to get a video of the failure as it happened while my wife was driving and I was a passenger. The entire panel blacked out and she pulled to the side of the road and I took a video of the 4 minutes the system was out. I will attach this video to this report.   In addition there is an additional problem that occurred related to the lane keep assist function. There are four options to configure this function they are: 1> OFF 2> Warning Buzzer Only 3> Lane Keep function Only 4> All Functions. My understanding of the operation of this system has one function that shuts the system Off that is obviously the OFF function. #2 although only a buzzer has the system on, #3 has the functionality working but no warning buzzer (my preferred choice) and #4 that has all functions operating both warning buzzer and lane keep functions. My concern is that if you use #3 the system shows a warning light on the dash that shows the system if OFF.  I have video of the electronics but don't know how to upload it.",

AS I APPROACHED THE DRIVE WAY THE BRAKES FUNCTIONED PROPERLY TO ALLOW ME TO TURN INTO THE DRIVEWAY, BUT SUDDENLY THE BRAKES STOPPED FUNCTIONING AND THE CAR ACCELERATED DRIVING STRAIGHT THROUGH MY CLOSED GARAGE DOOR. I WAS ABLE TO CONTROL STEERING BUT REGARDLESS OF MY FOOT PRESSING FIRMLY ON THE BRAKE PEDAL, THE CAR CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE. THANKFULLY, INSTALLED IN THE CEMENT WAS A ROGUE R3 WEIGHT RACK THAT WAS BOLTED INTO THE CEMENT AT FOUR LOCATIONS. THE CAR PROCEEDED FORWARD UNTIL COLLIDING WITH THE WEIGHT RACK, A MERE 3 FEET FROM OUR HVAC SYSTEM AND THE HOME STRUCTURE. I IMMEDIATELY TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF. IF THE WEIGHT RACK DID NOT STOP THE VEHICLE MYSELF AND MY TWO CHILDREN COULD HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY INJURED, NOT TO MENTION, IF MY HUSBAND OR TWO SMALL CHILDREN WERE IN THE GARAGE AT THE TIME, THIS COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY RESULTED IN DEATH. MY AIR BOGS DID NOT DEPLOY, THE AUTO COLLISION SAFETY MECHANISM FAILED. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. WE BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE WITH EXTENDED WARRANTY IN HOPES TO KEEP THIS AS A FAMILY VEHICLE FOR MANY YEARS TO COME, PRIMARY REASON FOR PURCHASE WAS SAFETY. THIS VEHICLE IS NOT SAFE AND I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE IT. MY VEHICLE WAS IMMEDIATELY TOWED TO RPM PERFORMANCE IN BURLINGTON WASHINGTON FOR INSPECTION. LATER, BROUGHT TO DWAYNE LANES SUBARU (PURCHASE LOCATION) FOR INSPECTION. FINDINGS WERE THAT THE VEHICLE OPERATED AS DESIGNED AND DRIVER IS AT FAULT. THIS VEHICLE IS DEFECTIVE.

BOTH HANDS WERE ON THE STEERING WHEEL, WITH ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL SET AT 70MPH.  LANE CENTERING WAS AMONG THE FEATURES OPERATING.      I SUDDENLY EXPERIENCED AN INSTANTANEOUS AND VERY ABRUPT, UNCOMMANDED ~30-40 DEGREE CLOCKWISE ROTATION OF THE STEERING WHEEL.  THE WHOLE EVENT LASTED JUST 2-3 SECONDS AND I QUICKLY RECOVERED BACK TO THE LEFT.  FORTUNATELY, THE LATERAL DISPLACEMENT OF OUR TRACK WAS ONLY A FEW FEET INTO THE BREAKDOWN LANE ON THE INTERSTATE.   MY MANUAL CONTROL INPUTS ON THE STEERING WHEEL EASILY OVERCAME THE ACTUATOR. I IMMEDIATELY DISABLED THE LANE CENTERING FUNCTION AND WE CONTINUED HOME WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.    THE TAKEAWAY THAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS THAT THIS WAS AN EXTREMELY ABRUPT, SUDDEN HARD RIGHT DEFLECTION OF THE WHEEL.  THIS WAS NOT THE NORMAL GENTLE NUDGE AND SLOW, SLIGHT STEERING WHEEL MOVEMENTS THAT THE LANE KEEP AND LANE CENTERING SYSTEMS NORMALLY PROVIDE.  IMAGINE THAT YOUR PASSENGER REACHED OVER AND FORCEFULLY GRABBED THE STEERING WHEEL AND YANKED HARD DOWN ON IT - THAT'S AS CLOSELY AS I CAN DESCRIBE THIS.",

FIRST INCIDENT:  THE CAR WAS IN AN INDOOR PARKING GARAGE, BACKED UP TO THE WALL WITH ABOUT 4 FT OF CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE CLOSED LIFT GATE AND THE WALL. I HAD JUST PUT MY 2-YEAR-OLD GRANDSON INTO HIS STROLLER, AND WE WERE BETWEEN THE REAR OF THE CAR AND THE WALL. AS I WAS WHEELING THE STROLLER AWAY FROM THE CAR, THE LIFT GATE AUTOMATICALLY OPENED AND PINNED THE STROLLER AGAINST THE WALL!  I WAS NOT TOUCHING THE KEY FOB IN ANY WAY.  THE GATE DID NOT IMMEDIATELY SENSE THE OBSTRUCTION, AND IT CONTINUED TO FORCE ITSELF AGAINST THE STROLLER. I HAD TO PUSH FORCEFULLY AGAINST THE LIFT GATE IN ORDER TO FREE MY GRANDSON AND ME.    SECOND INCIDENT:  AFTER RETURNING TO THE CAR WHICH WAS PARKED AS DESCRIBED IN THE FIRST INCIDENT, THE LIFT GATE FORCEFULLY HIT MY WIFE ON THE HEAD! I HAD RAISED THE GATE, AND AFTER THE GATE WAS ALL THE WAY UP, MY WIFE BENT DOWN TO PUT AN ITEM IN. THE LIFT GATE CAME DOWN ON HER HEAD. SHE WAS IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN!  IT HAS BEEN ABOUT 24 HOURS SINCE THIS OCCURRED, AND SHE IS STILL EXPERIENCING HEADACHE, NAUSEA AND BLURRED VISION.  WE ARE NOW SEEKING MEDICAL ATTENTION.    LATER THAT AFTERNOON I EXPERIMENTED WITH THE GATE, AND IT MALFUNCTIONED THE SAME WAY (2ND INCIDENT) 2 MORE TIMES!   AFTER IT WENT UP ALL THE WAY, THE GATE IMMEDIATELY CAME DOWN AUTOMATICALLY!
