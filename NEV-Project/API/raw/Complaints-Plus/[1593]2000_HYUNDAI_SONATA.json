AFTER DECIDING I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO PAY THAT MUCH MONEY, I WENT TO A LOCAL BODY SHOP LATER THAT MORNING TO GET AN ESTIMATE. THE BODY SHOP OWNER GAVE ME AN ESTIMATE OF $ 1035.00 TO REPLACE WITH A NEW  SUBFRAME AND RECOMMENDED POSSIBLY USING A USED PART FROM  A SALVAGE YARD, IF HE COULD FIND ONE.

AFTER I FINALLY MANAGED TO STOP THE CAR WITHOUT GETTING HIT BY ANOTHER DRIVER, AND CHECKING TO SEE IF MY WIFE WAS OK, I GOT OUT OF THE CAR JUST TO FIND OUT THAT MY FRONT RIGHT WHEEL WAS IN AN ALMOST HORIZONTAL POSITION.    AFTER TOWING THE CAR TO THE REPAIR SHOP, MY MECHANIC FOUND OUT THAT THE AXLE AND THE LOWER CONTROL ARM BROKE BECAUSE THE ENGINE CRADLE WAS SEVERELY RUSTED, AND THEREFORE THERE WAS NO SUPPORT FOR THE AXLE AND THE CONTROL ARM TO SUSTAIN THE WEIGHT AND PRESSURE OF THE SUDDEN STOP. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I BELIEVE THAT MY WIFE AND I ARE VERY LUCKY TO NOT HAVE BEEN INJURED, OR TO CAUSE SOMEBODY ELSE AN INJURY. THE REPAIRS WERE COSTLY, BUT I HAD TO DO IT. I NEED THE CAR TO WORK, AND WE LIVE IN A PLACE WERE THE CAR IS AN EVERYDAY NECESSITY.    THE CRADLE FOR THIS VEHICLE WAS DAMAGED AND COMPLETELY RUSTED AWAY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED COMPLETELY AT A COST OF $2,897.22.

A WRITTEN ESTIMATE FROM A LOCAL BODY SHOP FOR $996.59 SHOULD BE ADDED TO COVER THE BODY DAMAGE SUSTAINED WHEN THE RIGHT SIDE AXLE AND RIGHT SIDE LOWER CONTROL ARM CRACKED, CAUSING THE FRONT RIGHT SIDE WHEEL TO BEND THE RIGHT SIDE BUMPER COVER.

WE HAD IT TOWED TO A TRUSTED SERVICE STATION THAT PUT IT ON THE LIFT AND SAID THE FRONT SUBFRAME/CROSSMEMBER HAD RUSTED THROUGH CAUSING THE CONTROL ARM AND CV AXLE TO COME APART. I CALLED HYUNDAI AND THEY SAID THE CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY. WELL OUR CAR HAS BEEN SITTING AT THE SERVICE STATION FOR EIGHT MONTHS WAITING FOR A USED SUBFRAME THAT ISN'T RUSTED THROUGH. THEY THE SERVICE STATION HAS ORDERED 4 USED SUBFRAMES AND ALL HAVE BEEN RUSTED THROUGH. MY BROTHER RUNS A BODY SHOP IN N.C. AND HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR ONE FOR US AND CANT FIND ANY THAT AREN'T RUSTED. SUPPOSEDLY AS SOON AS THERE IS ONE THAT ISN'T RUSTED ITS SENT TO \"THE SALT BELT\" FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REPAIR A CAR THAT SHOULD NOT NEED IT. OUR FAMILY HAS 2 CARS ONE 13 YEARS OLDER THAN THIS SONATA AND ONE 16 YEARS OLDER THAN THIS SONATA. THEIR FRAMES AREN'T RUSTED THROUGH BOTH HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE IN THE SALT AND SNOW MORE THAN THIS SONATA. THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM THIS PART SHOULD BE THE LAST THING TO RUST THROUGH ON A CAR.

UPON GETTING ONTO THE SCHUYLKILL EXPRESSWAY I HEARD A SQUEAL ON THE TIGHT LEFT TURN (A VERY DANGEROUS, HIGH TRAFFIC HIGHWAY) AND STAYED ON THAT FOR APPROX ANOTHER 10MILES. I TURNED ONTO ANOTHER HIGHWAY. IMMEDIATELY AFTER GETTING OFF THE HIGHWAY I STOPPED AT THE FIRST INTERSECTION.       AFTER STOPPING I TRIED TO PULL OUT AND THERE WAS A LOUD CLUNKING NOISE, SMOKE FROM UNDER THE HOOD AND THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE AT ALL. WHILE I WAS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF A DANGEROUS INTERSECTION (THE COPS EVEN DROVE RIGHT ON BY), I WAS FRANTIC CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT IF HAD HAPPENED SECONDS SOONER, IT WOULD NO DOUBT HAVE BEEN TRAGIC ACCIDENT INVOLVING NOT ONLY MYSELF, MY MOTHER AND MY EIGHT YEAR OLD SON BUT ALSO OTHERS ON THE HIGHWAY.       THE MECHANIC, WHO EVALUATED THE CAR THE PREVIOUS WEEK, STATED THAT THE SUB-FRAME WAS \"ROTTED AND RUSTED OUT\" WHICH RESULTED IN THE AXLE DROPPING OUT OF THE TRANSMISSION. HE COULDN'T FIND USED PARTS. THE JUNK YARDS SAID ALL OF THE '99 AND '00 SONATAS HAVE THIS PROBLEM. THIS LACK OF KNOWLEDGE PUT MY FAMILY'S SAFETY IN GRAVE DANGER.      NO THERE WAS NO CRASH AND NO THERE WAS NO PROPERTY DAMAGE. THAT WAS ONLY DUE TO THE FORTUNATE TIMING OF THIS INCIDENT. PLEASE CONTACT HYUNDAI TO RECALL THIS PART NO ONE SHOULD BE PUT IN THIS LIFE THREATENING SITUATION.  *TR",

THE PROBLEM IS THE FRONT SUB-FRAME WAS NOT DESIGNED WITH SUFFICIENT CORROSION RESISTANCE AND IS ROTTING AWAY.  HYUNDAI CUSTOMER AFFAIRS (1-800-633-5151) STATES THAT BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS 8 YEARS OLD AND HAS 120K MILES ON IT THAT IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY.    I BELIEVE THAT AN AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURER HAS CERTAIN LIABILITIES FOR SAFETY AND THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE VEHICLES THEY PRODUCE BEYOND THE NORMAL WARRANTY PERIOD.  THE FIRST I NEW OF THE ISSUE WAS WHEN I HIT A POTHOLE IN A PARKING LOT AND THE CAR IMMEDIATELY STARTED PULLING TO THE RIGHT.  THE NEXT MORNING I JACKED THE FRONT OF THE CAR UP THINKING A WHEEL BEARING WAS GONE OR SOMETHING.  I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I LOOKED UNDER THE CAR AND SAW THE 'ELBOW' THAT COMES FROM THE FLOORBOARD AREA TO THE WHEEL WAS ROTTED THROUGH ON THE CORNER AND SPLITTING DOWN THE SEAM.  THE DRIVER'S SIDE IS ALSO CORRODED BUT NOT NEARLY AS BAD.    I CALLED HYUNDAI CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND WAS INSTRUCTED TO TAKE IT TO THE NEAREST DEALER FOR EVALUATION.  THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE SUB-FRAME NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND WOULD COST $2300.  AFTER SEVERAL PHONE CALLS BACK TO CONSUMER AFFAIRS THEY WON'T CHANGE THEIR OPINION THAT BECAUSE IT'S OUT OF WARRANTY THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE. SINCE THEY HAVE HAD TO FIX THIS ON OTHER VEHICLES SHOULDN'T THE DEALERS BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THE CORRODED SUB-FRAME.  MY SONATA WAS AT THE DEALER SEVERAL TIMES BETWEEN 2003 -2006 AND THE VEHICLE WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.    MY MAIN CONCERN IS THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE DRIVING CARS THAT THE FRAME HAS BEEN WEAKENED BY CORROSION AND COULD HAVE A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE.  IF I HAD HIT A POTHOLE ON THE INTERSTATE INSTEAD OF IN A PARKING LOT, MY WIFE'S LAWYER COULD VERY WELL BE ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE INSTEAD OF ME.  *TR",

WHAT I FIND OUTRAGEOUS ABOUT THIS, IS THE LAST TWO TIMES I'VE TAKEN MY VEHICLE IN,  I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE AIRBAG LIGHT WAS NOT ON.  WHEN I SPOKE WITH MR. WESTLAND, HE WANTED ME TO LEAVE THE CAR FOR SEVERAL DAYS AT THE DEALSHIP, FIRST TEAM, SO THEY COULD GO OVER IT BUMPER TO BUMPER.  ON JANUARY 8, 2001 I TOOK THE CAR INTO THE DEALER SO THEY COULD LOOK AT THE  TRANSMISSION AND THE AIRBAG LIGHT WHICH WAS ON AGAIN.  ON THAT EVENING, AT APPROXIMATELY 5:00, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE DEALSHIP, ASKING IF I COULD COME INTO THE DEALERSHIP THE NEXT MORNING TO DRIVE WITH ONE OF THEIR MECHANICS BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION.  I WAS UNABLE TO DO SO BECAUSE OF WORK.  I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THE AIRBAG LIGHT HAD NOT BEEN ON .  I PICKED UP THE CAR THAT EVENING SINCE, \"NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH IT\" AND WOULD BE UNABLE TO TEST DRIVE IT WITH A MECHANIC.  .  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE DEALERSHIP IS SAYING THAT THE AIRBAG LIGHT HAS NOT BEEN ON THE LAST SEVERAL TIMES WHEN IT HAS BEEN.

WE ASKED IF FACTORY SEAT BELT EXTENSIONS WERE AVAILABLE. THEY STATED THAT THE PARTS DEPARTMENT HAD THEM BUT THEY WERE CLOSED (WE BOUGHT THE CAR ON A SATURADY AFTERNOON). THEY SAID WE COULD PICK THEM UP ON MONDAY.  WE CONTACTED THE DEALER ON MONDAY AND WERE TOLD THAT THE PARTS DEPARTMENT DIDN'T HAVE THEM AND WOULD HAVE TO GET THEM FROM HYUNDAI. WE AGAIN CONTACTED THE DEALER ON TUESDAY AND THEY SAID THAT HYUNDAI NO LONGER PROVIDED SEAT BELT EXTENSIONS BECAUSE OF NUMEREOUS LIABILITIES SUITS THAT HAVE BEEN FILE DUE TO THEIR FAILURE. THEY STATED THAT THEY WOULD RESEARCH OTHER AVENUES. ON 5/17/00 WE WERE INFORMED THAT THE DEALER WOULD HAVE A TRIM SHOP TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM AND WE NEEDED TO CALL THEM TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT. IN DISCUSSIONS WITH MY WIFE, THE TRIM SHOP STATED THAT THEY COULD FIX THE PROBLEM, BUT THEY WERE NOT SURE THAT THEY COULD MATCH THE COLOR.  IT TURNS OUT THAT THEY WERE PLANNED TO SPLICE A PIECE OF SEAT BELT MATERIAL INTO THE EXSITING SEAT BELT.
