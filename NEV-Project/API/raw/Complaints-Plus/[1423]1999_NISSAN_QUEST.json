TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A DIFFERENT SHOP TO HAVE A TIRE REPAIRED AND THE PADS REPLACED AND THE DRIVER'S FRONT LOCKED UP AGAIN ON THE TECHNICIAN WHILE ROAD TESTING HIS REPAIR.

MY OPINION IS THAT THIS IS A DESIGN DEFECT, IF PARTICULATES FROM A MC CAN FLOAT AND CLOG AN ABS ACTUATOR TO THE POINT THAT LOCKUP OF AN INDIVIDUAL BRAKE OCCURS. ABS IS SUPPOSED TO PREVENT LOCKUP, NOT CAUSE IT. THE BRAKES ARE ACTUALLY FORD DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION. I KNOW SOMEONE WHO ALSO HAD A FORD EXPLORER AND THE PASSENGER FRONT BRAKE LOCKED UP ON HER INTERMITTENTLY LIKE MY WIFE'S HAS. THE ABS ACTUATOR IS NOT AVAILABLE NEW ANYMORE, MY ONLY RECOURSE IS TO INSTALL A JUNK PART WHICH IS MOST LIKELY DEFECTIVE.

AFTER THE PLUG JAMMED I LOOKED IN THE \"TUBE\" WHERE YOU INSERT THE PLUG LOOKING FOR ANYTHING BLOCKING THE PLUG EXTRACTION. AFTER I REMOVED THE PLUG THE THREADS SHOWED NO SIGNS OF STRIPPING. I LOOKED IN THE \"TUBE\" AGAIN & STILL COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING. THE AREA OF THE PLUG BELOW THE \"NUT PART\" & ABOVE THE THREADS LOOKED MANGLED. AFTER INSERTING THE NEW PLUGS I TESTED THE ENGINE & HEARD A MUCH LOUDER NOISE. I TOWED IT TO THE DEALERSHIP TO MAKE ANY REPAIRS UNDER MY EXTENDED SERVICE PLAN (ESP). THE SERVICE WRITER CALLED & I APPROVED A $200 TEAR DOWN FEE THAT WOULD APPLY TO ANY REPAIRS NEEDED OR COVERED UNDER THE ESP. LATER THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD NOT DO THE REPAIRS UNDER THE ESP AS A FOREIGN OBJECT DAMAGED THE PISTON/CYLINDER. THEY COULD NOT IDENTIFY THE OBJECT BUT SAID THAT SINCE NISSAN DID NOT MAKE THE REPAIRS THE ESP WOULD NOT COVER IT. I SPENT 3 DAYS FIGHTING WITH NISSAN'S CONSUMER RELATIONS DEPT & AN EXECUTIVE ASST. THIS LADY SAID NISSAN WOULD NOT COVER THE REPAIR. THE GENERAL MANAGER AT THE DEALERSHIP AGREED THAT HAD HIS TECH CHANGED THE PLUGS HE WOULD HAVE JUST AS LIKELY AS NOT HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH THE SAME RESULTS. NOW SINCE I EXERCISED MY RIGHTS & APPEALED TO THE CORPORATE OFFICES OF NISSAN THE DEALERSHIP WILL NOT COMPLETE ANY REPAIRS.

THEY FINALLY AGREED AND ORDERED SPECIAL PADS FROM THE FACTORY.  NOISE WENT AWAY UNTIL LAST MONTH.  THEY REPLACED THE PADS ONCE AGAIN AND IT'S OK RIGHT NOW.  AN ENGINEER FROM THE FACTORY FINALLY ADMITTED THAT THERE'S A DEFECT IN THE DESIGN AND MOST '99 QUEST HAVE THAT SAME PROBLEM.  DRIVER SIDE MIRROR VIBRATES AT HIGH SPEED ABOVE 70.  AGAIN, ENGINEER FROM FACTORY STATED THAT IS A DEFECT AND R&D IS TRYING TO RESOLVE IT.  DRIVER SIDE SLIDING DOOR LATCH COMES OPEN AFTER SLIDING IT BACK AND FOURTH AFTER FOUR TIMES.  IT HAS BEEN BACK TO THE DEALER MANY TIMES AND SINCE YESTERDAY, IT'S OK.  THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THE POOR GAS MILEAGE.  WE'RE PUTTING IN 87 OCTANE GAS RECOMMENDED IN THE MANUAL.  WE'VE BEEN GETTING ABOUT 13 MILES/GALLON IN THE CITY AND ABOUT 18 IF WE DRIVE BOTH FREEWAY AND CITY.  THE TANK TAKES ABOUT 20 GALLONS AND EVERY 16.5 GALLONS, WE'RE ONLY GETTING ABOUT 260 MILES FROM THE TRIP READING.  NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIR FIRST TOLD US THAT NEW CAR WILL GIVE POOR READING SINCE ALL PARTS HAVEN'T BEEN BROKEN INTO.  WE SHOULD DRIVE IT TO 5000 MILES.  THE VAN IS AT 5750 MILES AND MILEAGE HAS NOT IMPROVED AT ALL.  I CONTACTED CONSUMER AFFAIR AND THEY TOLD ME THAT I SHOULD NOT BE USING MOBIL AND ARCO GAS AND TO GET THAT KIND OF MILEAGE, I SHOULD BE PUTTING IN 95 OCTANE.
