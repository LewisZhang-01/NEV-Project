        "summary": "I HAVE A DPS6 TRANSMISSION IN MY 2012 FORD FIESTA SES THAT IS MALFUNCTIONING AS DESCRIBED BY THE MANUFACTURER. THERE IS A SEVERE SHUDDER AND SLIPPAGE IN THE TRANSMISSION, AS WELL AS A RACING OF THE ENGINE WHEN MY FOOT IS ON THE BRAKE AND OFF THE GAS PEDDLE. THE RPM'S RACE TO OVER 1800 RPM'S WHILE AT A LIGHT OR IN HEAVY TRAFFIC. WHEN I RELEASE THE BRAKE AND ACCELERATE THE TRANSMISSION RE-ENGAGES AND SLIPS SO BADLY, THAT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS OTHER DRIVERS HAVE ALMOST DRIVEN INTO THE BACK OF MY CAR. ONCE MY CAR GETS PAST THIRD GEAR, IT DRIVES AND APPEARS TO SHIFT AND DRIVE BETTER UNTIL LETTING OFF THE GAS AGAIN. I GET PEOPLE SCREAMING AT ME AND GETTING VERY UPSET DURING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC. I COULD SEE SO MANY WAYS THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, EVEN WORSE THAN THE DOOR LOCK RECALL. I AM FORCED TO DRIVE THIS CAR, AS FOR NO OTHER CHOICE. A CAR CRASH WOULD BE HORRIBLE FOR ME AND MY CHILDREN; BUT, ALSO ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND I WOULD BEG YOU TO CONSIDER THIS A SAFETY RECALL.  FORD HAS CONSIDERED THIS A CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM, WHICH FALLS UNDER A WARRANTY WHICH MY CARS DOES NOT FALL UNDER BECAUSE IT IS A SALVAGE REBUILT TITLES. IT IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR YOU KIND CONSIDERATION.",
