When I dropped it off initially I parked on lot by the garage inc front of the rental car business directly in front. I exited my vehicle walking up to repair garage to make sure I could drive into it for recall repair.  I walked back opened my driver's door and sat in the seat.(legally able to safely driver by entering through the driver's door) I drove it up there. Upon arriving after they provided the airbags recall, moved my dome light which was located on driver's door module that also has other functions,(moved to another module preventing an interior fire on long trips which I was moving for a job to Audubon MN that next few days) and I was unable to enter the vehicle by my driver's door.  I had to physically crawl in the passengers side of car over the middle area and drink holders to squeeze my legs under the steering wheel. They informed me it was like that. I requested the video from rental employee mgr or person in charge and he stated \"it would be like finding a needle in the haystack\". It happened that I also sat for over 3 hours till close there, had a mgr request 2 inspections from his men, filed a complaint, talked with several reps and all before I left the lot.  Also I had a tire light on my dash, and others that I find out are all connected to the module the dome light used to be attached to.  While leaving my door locks were going up and down like they were a possessed pissed of psycho spirit , my steering wheel didn't lock anymore, and I decided to wash my car in a CAR WASH which almost got me a rear end incident from the car behind me because my 2004 DODGE DURANGO SUDDENLY SHUT OFF. I was scared and my heart dropped down through me bottom like being pulled over for a ticket by the police would.  So it decided to rain.OH MY GOSH. If MN wasn't a rainy place I wouldn't be SO",

I IMMEDIATELY TURNED OFF THE TRUCK AND WENT BACK INSIDE TO MAKE SOME CALLS AND GET ON THE INTERNET. I FOUND OUT THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH THIS TRUCK CONCERNING WATER LEAKING INTO THE ENGINE CAUSING IT TO HYDROLOCK THE ENGINE CAUSING CATASTROPHIC ENGINE FAILURE/ ENGINE REPLACEMENT. PRIOR TO THIS, I HAD ISSUES WITH THE TRUCK CONCERNING IDLING AND/OR STALLING DURING THE RAIN OR WHEN GOING THROUGH A CAR WASH.  I READ SO MANY COMMENTS FROM FELLOW VEHICLE OWNERS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS ISSUE AND HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE ENGINE. THERE IS NO OTHER FIX. THE ESTIMATED FIX FOR THIS IS A NEW/USED ENGINE COSTING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS (I WAS QUOTED 7000, I ONLY PAID 10,000 FOR THE TRUCK WHEN I BOUGHT IT). I HAD A MECHANIC COME LOOK AT IT AND HE SAID THE TRUCK DROPPED A VALVE, IT WAS CYLINDER #3. MY ENGINE HAS JUST OVER 113,000 MILES ON IT. THERE IS NO REASON I SHOULD HAVE TO REPLACE AN ENGINE AT THIS MILEAGE. NONE WHATSOEVER.

LUCKILY THE PART THAT BROKE WENT DOWN AND THE OIL PAN GASKET/WINDAGE TRAY SLOWED IT DOWN ENOUGH TO NOT GO THROUGH THE BLOCK.

I HAVE INSERTED PICTURES OF THEIR INTAKE GASKETS AND THEN I HELD A RULER UP TO THE INTAKE FLAT AND YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE LIGHT SHINING THROUGH THE GASKET WHICH MEANS THAT THIS WAS DEFINITELY NOT SEALING.

I TRIED IMMEDIATELY TO GET TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BUT WHEN I LOST POWER STEERING FROM THE ENGINE CEIZING AND COULDN'T CORRECT MYSELF ENOUGH SO I WENT DOWN THE HILL OFF THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY WHILE TRYING TO BREAK WITH NO BRAKE BOOSTER ANYMORE AS WELL. I ENDED UP RUNNING INTO A COUPLE SMALL TREE'S AND FINALLY STOPPING . AIR BAGS DIDN'T DEPLOY AND I ONLY JAMMED MY FINGER AND HURT MY BACK SOME BUT I ONLY MISSED A LARGER GROUP OF TREE BY INCHES. MY FRONT BUMPER WAS RIPPED OFF, MY DRIVERS SIDE HEADLIGHT WAS BROKE AS WELL AS MY GRILLE AND MY WINDSHIELD CRACKED. I TOOK IT TO MY MECHANIC AND FOUND OUT THAT THE ENGINE \"HYDROLOCKED\" AND A PISTON ROD PUNCHED THROUGH MY ENGINE AND BROKE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS INTERNALLY. NEEDLESS TO SAY THE ENGINE IS GONE. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH I HAVE FOUND THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS MORE PEOPLE THAT HAD THIS HAPPEN TO THEIR 04 AND 05 DODGE DURANGO WITH THE 5.7L HEMI. APPARENTLY THE WATER RUNS RIGHT DOWN ONTO THE ENGINE AND POOLS UP AND THE INTAKE IS FAULTY SO IT SUCKS THAT WATER UP AND CAUSES A CATASTROPHIC HYDROLOCK WITH THE ENGINE WHICH COULD KILL SOMEONE IF THEY LOSE POWER STEERING AND POWER BRAKES WITHIN A SECOND. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SAVE TO GET A NEW ENGINE (WHICH WILL COST ABOUT $3800 ALONE) BECAUSE I BOUGHT THIS FOR TOO MUCH AND NEITHER DODGE OR MY INSURANCE WOULD COVER IT SO IT'S NOW A PILE OF SCRAP UNTIL I HOPEFULLY CAN GET A NEW ENGINE OR HAVE DODGE BUY THIS DEATH TRAP BACK.

CHECKING VARIOUS FORUMS THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH 04 DURANGOS WITH 5.7 HEMIS. MANY MANY INCIDENTS SOME WHILE DRIVING WERE REPORTED.

THIS IS A COMPLETE FAILURE TO THE ENGINE, WITH THE ONLY SOLUTION BEING TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE ENGINE.  BASED ON MY MECHANICS OBSERVATION, THIS IS A RESULT OF WATER BEING DIRECTED INTO THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT, THEREFORE RUSTING AND DESTROYING NECESSARY COMPONENTS.  WHEN THE ENGINE WAS PULLED FROM MY VEHICLE, IT HAD BEEN SITTING IN A LARGE AMOUNT OF WATER, EVEN AFTER HAVING BEEN GARAGE KEPT FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.  AFTER READING ONLINE, THIS IS A VERY COMMON OCCURRENCE WITH THESE 2004 DURANGOS.  AT THAT, DODGE HAS NEVER ISSUED A RECALL.  I AM NOW OUT $7900 FOR A NEW ENGINE.  ALL I CAN SAY, IS THANK GOD I WAS IN MY DRIVEWAY WHEN THIS HAPPENED.  I AM SO FEARFUL THIS WILL HAPPEN TO SOMEONE WHILE THEY ARE DRIVING, RESULTING IN SOMETHING TRAGIC.

I TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE DEALER AND THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THE TICKING WAS AND WANTED ME TO PAY ABOUT $550 IN LABOR SO THEY COULD TAKE THE MOTOR APART.

I DIDN'T EVEN USE THE TRUCK AT ALL AND A TICKING NOISE NOW TURNED INTO A BANGING SOUND.  I HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO MY MECHANIC WHO INFORMED ME THAT I NEEDED A MOTOR. BROKEN ROD.

I RESEARCHED THIS ONLINE AND FOUND IT WAS MOST LIKELY THE PLASTIC WIPER COWL BELOW THE WINDSHIELD ALLOWING WATER TO FLOW OVER THE TOP OF THE ENGINE, WHICH COLLECTS ON THE INTAKE MANIFOLD AND MIGHT SLOWLY MAKE IT'S WAY IN TO THE BLOCK AND HYDROLOCK THE ENGINE. SERIOUSLY I THOUGHT. I WENT OUT THE NEXT DAY AND OPENED THE HOOD AND PLACED THE GARDEN HOSE OVER THE CENTER OF THE WINDSHIELD WITH THE WIPERS ON AND RAN THE WATER ON LOW, AND ALSO IN THE OFF POSITION. SURE ENOUGH A LOT OF WATER FLOWS IN TO THE DRIVER SIDE WIPER HOLE WHERE IT ROTATES AND SPREADS OUT OVER THE BACK TWO CYLINDERS OF THE CENTER OF THE ENGINE. I FOUND THERE IS POSSIBLY AN UPGRADE WIPER COWL THAT MAY PREVENT SOME OF THE WATER FLOW BUY NOT ALL OF IT. SO NOW I AM CONCERNED WITH THIS CIRCUMSTANCED EVEN AFTER I GET THE NEW COWL THAT WATER WILL STILL BE DAMAGING OR DESTROYING MY ENGINE ONE DAY FROM WATER FLOWING THROUGH THE COWL OVER THE TOP OF THE ENGINE ONCE AGAIN.

AFTER I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED HOME DUE TO THE ESTIMATED $7000 REPAIR BILL, I CALLED SEVERAL CHRYSLER MECHANICS WHO TOLD ME THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THAT MODEL AND ENGINE YEAR DUE TO BOTH WATER LEAKING INTO THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT (TSB ISSUED) AND A POSSIBLE PROBLEM WITH THE CRANK MAIN BEARING. I CALLED CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE (JOKE) AND BOTH THE PEOPLE I TALKED TOO \"LITERALLY\" ASKED WHY I WAS CALLING SINCE THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED AND IT WAS NO LONGER CHRYSLER'S PROBLEM. I TOLD THEM BECAUSE WARRANTY HAS NO BEARING ON A KNOWN DEFECT. THE SECOND PERSON I TALKED TO LITERALLY LAUGHED AT ME ON THE PHONE AND REFUSED TO LET ME TALK TO SOMEONE HIGHER THAN HIM STATING \"I AM AS HIGH AS IT GETS\" AND TOLD ME \"CHRYSLER IS NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING FOR YOU\". I ASKED HIS IF THIS IS THE NEW CHRYSLER AFTER \"I\" HELPED BAIL THEM OUT, HE SAID THEY BAILED THEMSELVES OUT. THIS IS THE SAME CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT TOLD ME THERE WERE NO ELECTRICAL ISSUES, THEN 6 MONTHS LATER RECALLED MY TRUCK DUE TO ELECTRIC FIRES. IF THIS DOES NOT GET RESOLVED BY CHRYSLER, I NOR WILL A ANYONE IN MY FAMILY EVER BUY ANOTHER CHRYSLER PRODUCT.   *TR",

THE REASON FOR THE ENGINE FAILURE IS RAIN. OR CAR WASHES. I STOPPED DRIVING MY DURANGO IN THE CAR WASH AND DURING RAIN BECAUSE IT WOULD STALL OUT AND RUN EXTREMELY ROUGH.

AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF RESEARCH, A NEW BATTERY, STARTER, AND IGNITION FUSE, WE FINALLY TURNED THE ENGINE MANUALLY TO GET IT STARTED. THAT'S WHEN THE KNOCKING ENGINE WAS REVEALED.

THE \"SERVICE 4WD\" AND THE TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT BEGAN FLASHING, AND IT FELT LIKE THE TRANSFER CASE WAS STUCK IN 4HI WITH THE TIRES GRABBING ON A TURN. THE SELECTOR KNOB ON THE DASH WOULD NOT FUNCTION.  I BROUGHT THE TRUCK TO MY MECHANIC WHO CHECKED THE FUNCTION OF THE TRANSFER CASE MOTOR, INSPECTED THE MOTOR AND WIRING, AND CHANGED THE TRANSFER CASE FLUID AGAIN. I CALLED MY LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALER AND THEY ADVISED THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO CHANGE THE TRANSFER CASE MOTOR. THE MOTOR COSTS $1190 PLUS TWO HOURS LABOR AND TWO QUARTS OF ATF+4 FLUID. I BROUGHT THE TRUCK BACK TO MY MECHANIC AND HE SAID THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE MOTOR OR THE TRANSFER CASE OR THE DASH SELECTOR KNOB. HE SAID HE BELIEVES THIS IS A CONTROL MODULE OR PROGRAMMING ISSUE. I GOT A THIRD OPINION AT MY LOCAL LEE MYLES. THEY CONCURRED THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE TRANSFER CASE MOTOR AND  THERE MUST BE SOME ISSUE WITH THE COMPUTER, PROGRAMMING, OR ONE OR MORE OF THE CONTROL MODULES. THE TRUCK CONTINUES TO DO THE SAME THING. THE MALFUNCTION CONDITION EXISTS APPROXIMATELY 65% OF THE TIME. I CAN'T AFFORD TO BRING TO THE DEALER NOW AND SPEND OVER $1300 FOR A REPAIR THAT I DO NOT THINK WILL CORRECT THE PROBLEM. I HAVE READ ON MANY MESSAGE BOARDS THAT THIS SEEMS TO BE A VERY COMMON ISSUE WITH 2004-2006 DURANGOS AND CHANGING THE MOTOR, OR THE SWITCH DOES NOT HELP THE SITUATION. I ALSO NOTICE THAT AT TIMES WHEN I OPEN THE DOORS OR UNLOCK THE DOORS WITH THE KEY FOB, I CAN HEAR THE TRANSFER CASE MOTOR CYCLING. THIS SEEMS TO BE AN ELECTRICAL OR PROGRAMMING ISSUE.

THE WINDSHIELD COWL LEAKS WATER ONTO THE ENGINE, THE WATER LEAKS INTO THE ENGINE AND CAUSES THE PISTON RODS TO RUST AND WEAKEN. THIS CAUSES FAILURE WITHOUT NOTICE. DODGE KNEW OF THIS PROBLEM AND CHANGED THE WINDSHIELD COWL SOMETIME IN 2005-2006. THIS VEHICLE WAS EXTREMELY WELL TAKEN CARE OF. NOTHING BUT SYNTHETIC OIL WENT INTO THIS ENGINE. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, I TOOK MY DURANGO TO A MECHANIC BECAUSE I THOUGHT I COULD SMELL GASOLINE ON THE OIL CAP. I WAS TOLD THAT THE SMELL IS MOST LIKELY FROM WATER GETTING INTO THE ENGINE. MOST LIKELY FROM THE INTAKE AND THAT I WAS NORMAL. NOW I KNOW THAT IT WAS WATER GETTING INTO THE ENGINE, A LOT MORE THAN A LITTLE MOISTURE COMING IN THROUGH THE AIR INTAKE.

THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT MY COWL PANEL NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, BASICALLY THIS PART WAS NOT DESIGNED CORRECTLY AND RAIN WATER OR WATER FROM A CAR WASH WAS DRAINING INTO MY ENGINE. HAD THE PART REPLACED FOR A WONDERFUL PRICE OF $236.00. I STARTED EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM AGAIN AT THE END OF APRIL, PICKED MY KIDS UP FROM SCHOOL AND WAS STRANDED IN A PARKING LOT FOR AN 1HR BC OF THE HARD RAIN. TOOK MY VEHICLE BACK ON MAY 6TH TO THE VENDOR MECHANIC(STILL UNDER A WARRANTY, DOESN'T HELP:( ) AND I WAS TOLD THAT THE PART HAD BEEN REPLACED THAT IT SHOULD WORK, COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHY IT WASN'T WORKING. CONTACTED CHRYSLER ASKING IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DONE, CHRYSLER DOESN'T UNDER STAND WHY THIS NEWLY DESIGNED PART IS NOT WORKING. SO I HAVE AT THIS TIME, 2 MECH/TECH'S TELLING ME THAT THEY CANT FIX THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE PART SHOULD WORK. TRIED AN ALTERNATE METHOD WITH WEATHER STRIPPING AND SILICONE TO PLUG UP THE HOLES. I PICK SAID VEHICLE UP FROM THE SHOP ON MAY 8TH, DRIVE 3.2 MILES TURN ON MY STREET AN MY VEHICLE COMPLETELY CUTS OFF! CAN NOT GET IT TO CRANK BACK. CALL THE MECHANIC SHOP BACK EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT HAPPENED TAKE IT BACK THE NEXT DAY THEY BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE THROTTLE BODY, MY WARRANTY WONT COVER IT. HAVE MY VEHICLE TOWED TO DODGE AND BECAUSE OF THIS COWL PANEL LEAK MY INTAKE GASKETS ARE MESSED UP AND THE CM FRONT AND BACK NEED TO BE FLASHED AND RESET, TOTALING OUT TO BE $870.00 BUT STILL CANT FIX THE COWL PANEL.

TOO MANY THINGS HAVE REPLACED ON THIS CAR I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO TELL YOU, IT IS IN PREVIOUS LETTERS SENT TO CHRYSLER-AND IT ISN'T JUST ME. I MAINTAINED THIS VEHICLE, GOT REGULAR OIL CHANGES, ETC. AND IT BACKFIRED ON ME. I REALIZE IT IS 10 YEARS OLD AND WE PUT A LOT OF HIGHWAY MILES ON THE CAR TAKING FAMILY VACATIONS AND EVERY FAMILY VACATION, THERE HAS BEEN A CAR PROBLEM.  I PUT SO MUCH MONEY INTO THIS CAR, I CAN'T SAVE UP ENOUGH TO GET ANYTHING NEW. I KNOW FAMILY MEMBERS THAT HAVE CARS 10-15 YEARS OLD AND HAVEN'T PUT A DIME INTO THEIR CAR, OTHER THAN MAINTENANCE, NEW TIRES, OIL CHANGES, ETC.  I CANNOT EXPRESS THE AMOUNT OF STRESS THIS CAR HAS PUT ON ME. IT HAS LEFT ME STRANDED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WITH MY KIDS IN THE CAR. NOT RELIABLE WHATSOEVER, WOULD NEVER PURCHASE A DODGE/CHRYSLER PRODUCT AGAIN. EVERY TIME I TAKE IT SOME WHERE, THE MECHANICS ALWAYS MENTION THE POOR DESIGN OF THE ENGINE.  *TR",

ON CHRISTMAS NIGHT, I TOOK MY FATHER HOME WHO LIVES ABOUT 30 MILES AWAY FROM ME AND CAME STRAIGHT BACK HOME AND PARKED THE TRUCK.  NO ISSUES OR PROBLEMS.  LATER THE NEXT NIGHT, I WENT OUT TO START IT TO GO TO THE STORE AND IT WOULD NOT START.  IT HAD RAINED EARLIER THAT DAY AND IT WAS COLD SO I JUST THOUGHT  THAT MAYBE I NEEDED A JUMP.  IT WAS LATE SO I DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT GETTING ONE FROM ANYONE.  THE NEXT MORNING I GOT UP EARLY TO TRY TO START IT AGAIN AND STILL NOTHING, SO I ASKED MY NEIGHBOR FOR A JUMP.  WHEN HE TRIED TO JUMP MY TRUCK IT MADE A HORRIBLE NOISE SO WE STOPPED AND I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THEM WHAT HAPPENED.  THEY SENT TWO OF THEIR MECHANICS OVER TO MY HOUSE TO TRY AND JUMP IT AND THEY WAS SHOCKED BY THE NOISE THEY HEARD.  THEY INITIALLY THOUGHT IT MAY BE THE STARTER AND THEY ALSO VERIFIED THAT ALL MY FLUIDS WERE FULL.  THEY ENDED UP TOWING MY TRUCK BACK TO THEIR DEALERSHIP AND A FEW HOURS LATER THEY CALLED AND TOLD ME MY ENGINE LOCKED UP....THIS WAS SO DEVASTATING FOR ME TO HEAR BECAUSE THEY TOLD ME THE REPAIR WOULD BE $3000.  I HAVE NOT HAD THE VEHICLE A YEAR YET AND AM A SINGLE MOTHER OF TWO KIDS.  THIS PROBLEM IS VERY COMMON WITH THE SAME TRUCK THAT I HAVE WITH THE HEMI ENGINE.

AND THEY HAVE OPENED A CASE NUMBER FOR ME, BUT THEY HAVE NOT MADE ANY COMMITMENT, IF THEY WILL COVER THE FAILURE.  AFTER SOME OF MY OWN INVESTIGATING, I HAVE DISCOVERED THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS, OF THE EXACT SAME NATURE AS MY FAILURE, WITH THIS IDENTICAL MAKE/MODEL YEAR AND 5.7L HEMI ENGINE, WITH MANY FAILURES OCCURRING IN THE 80-120K MILE RANGE (MY MILEAGE 97K).  VERY ANGRY AND UPSET ABOUT THIS FAILURE, BUT THANKFUL I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY PULL OVER WITHOUT ANY FURTHER INCIDENT AND INJURY.  *TR",

WHEN I PULLED OUT ONTO THE ROAD I ONLY GOT ABOUT 1/2 MILE BEFORE MY ENGINE MADE A HORRIBLE NOISE AND JERKED REAL HARD, MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AS DID MY OIL LIGHT. AS I WAS PULLING OFF THE ROAD I LOST THE POWER STEERING AS WELL,SMOKE POURED OUT FROM UNDER MY DURANGO. I GOT OUT AS I WAS AFRAID IT WAS GOING TO CATCH FIRE. I CALLED FOR HELP AND WAITED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. THE TOW TRUCK GUY GOT THERE AND TOLD ME THERE WAS OIL ALL UNDERNEATH OF MY TRUCK. I HAD IT TOWED TO MY LOCAL SHOP TO SEE WHAT WAS WRONG. GUESS WHAT? A ROD HAS BEEN PUSHED THROUGH MY ENGINE AND NOW I NEED A NEW ONE. MY DURANGO ONLY HAS 85,200 MILES ON IT. I AM REALLY MAD, I HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO COULD HAVE BEEN WITH ME AND WE COULD HAVE BEEN ON THE INTERSTATE WHEN THIS HAPPENED, I HATE TO THINK THAT WAS POSSIBLE AND WHAT THE OUTCOME COULD HAVE BEEN. THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE AND I AM SURPRISED NO RECALL HAS BEEN MADE.WE AS CONSUMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO A VEHICLE THAT IS SAFE FOR US, THE LAW IS SUPPOSED TO PREVENT THIS FROM RE-OCCURING. I CAN SE IF THIS WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT, BUT ITS NOT. I HAVE STARTED LOOKING AND I SEE THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS AND THAT IS ONLY ON A COUPLE BOARDS/FORUMS, HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE, WHO IS RESPONSIBLE. I ENCOURGE ALL DURANGO OWNERS WHO HAVE HAD THIS ISSUE TO STEP FORWARD AND COMPLAIN, TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I ALREADY CONTACTED MY LOCAL NEWS, AND I WILL BE SENDING LETTERS TO REID BIGLAND (THE PRESIDENT OF CHRYSLER CORP). CHRYSLER/DODGE GOT A BAILOUT WHEN THEY WERE READY TO BE BANKRUPT, BUT WHERE DOES THAT HELP THE AVERAGE CONSUMER. WE ARE ALL HAVING DIFFICULT TIMES IN THIS ECONOMY, WHERE IS THE HELP FOR US? WE ARE LEFT TO PAY WELL OVER 6000 FOR ENGINE REPAIRS THAT DODGE/CHRYSLER CORP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR.  WE ALL NEED JUSTICE HERE.  *TR",

WATER HAS SOMEHOW GOTTEN INTO MY MOTOR CAUSING ALL KINDS OF ISSUES.  WITHIN THE PAST YEAR, IT HAS HAD ISSUES RUNNING HOT, RUNNING POORLY WHEN IT RAINS AND ROUGH IDLE ON OCCASION.  AFTER SITTING FOR 24 HOURS, I WENT OUT TO CRANK IT AND IT JUMPED (I THOUGHT A SMALL ANIMAL HAD CRAWLED INTO MY MOTOR) AND IT SHUT OFF.  I THEN RE-CRANKED IT AND IT SOUNDS LIKE A SEWING MACHINE.  I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED AND AM NOW LOOKING AT $4000 FOR ANOTHER MOTOR.  I'VE HAVE RESEARCHED THE INTERNET AND AM TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY AT THE OTHERS HAVING THE ISSUES WITH THE SAME EXACT MAKE AND MODEL OF VEHICLE.  THIS IS SOMETHING CHRYSLER SHOULD MAKE RIGHT.  I AM A SINGLE MOTHER AND LIVE WEEK TO WEEK, I CAN NOT AFFORD TO DO THIS, BUT I HAVE TO.  WORKING FULL TIME, CARING FOR A 10 YEAR OLD AND NOW APPLYING FOR A PART-TIME JOB IS WHAT THIS EXTRA EXPENSE IS CAUSING ME TO DO.  I THINK SOMEONE SHOULD DO SOMETHING - IF I WIN THE LOTTERY, YOU BEST BELIEVE I WILL.  CHRYSLER DO THE RIGHT THING....THIS IS HAPPENING TOO MUCH AND IS A DEFECT - NO DOUBT.  TOYOTA DID A RECALL - MAYBE IF I'M EVER TO BUY ANOTHER VEHICLE, ATLEAST THEY WOULD MAKE IT RIGHT. *KICKS SOAPBOX*.  *TR",

I WAS UP TO APPROXIMATELY 35MPH WHEN I HEARD A VERY LOUD POP, MORE LIKE AN EXPLOSION, FOLLOWED BY VERY LOUD ''SLAPPING'' NOISES COMING FROM THE ENGINE AREA.  IT SOUNDED LIKE A TIRE BURST, FOLLOWED BY DRIVING ON A DEAD FLAT TIRE.  THE CAR WAS SLOWING VERY QUICKLY, AND IT HAD NO POWER.  WITHIN SECONDS I REALIZED IT WAS A MAJOR ENGINE OR TRANSMISSION PROBLEM, AND I WAS GOING TO BE STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.  BEFORE SO, I WAS ABLE TO SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL AND COAST OFF TO THE SIDE.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT MY WIFE OR DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THE SAME.  THEY WOULD HAVE STOPPED WITHIN SECONDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS VERY BUSY ROAD.  THE LOUD SLAPPING NOISES STOPPED ONCE THE CAR WAS IN NEUTRAL.  I WAS ABLE TO PUT THE CAR INTO PARK AND VISUALLY CHECK AROUND.  I SAW NOTHING OTHER THAN A SMALL TRAIL OF OIL BEHIND THE CAR, A SMALL PUDDLE UNDER THE DRIVER''S SIDE OF THE ENGINE, AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF OIL ON THE UNDERSIDE AND ON THE SIDE OF THE ENGINE ON THE DRIVER''S SIDE.   I HAVE MUCH MORE DETAILS TO THIS STORY, PLEASE REQUEST IF NEEDED, BUT THE DODGE DEALER TOLD ME I HAD THROWN A ROD, WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING INSIDE THE ENGINE.

I CALLED A LOCAL MECHANIC ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND HE CAME TO MY HOUSE TO HEAR THE PROBLEM. WHEN WE STARTED THE ENGINE, THE NOISE WAS NOTICEABLY LOUDER.

I CONTACTED ONE PLACE CHECKING ON A REPLACEMENT ENGINE AND THE GENTLEMAN SAID \"YOU'RE LUCKY, MOST PEOPLE WITH THAT YEAR DURANGO, HAVE ALREADY HAD TO REPLACE THEIR MOTORS 2-3 TIMES!\"  LUCKY, ARE YOU SERIOUS?  WHO COULD AFFORD TO DO THAT 2-3 TIMES???  SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS!  CHRYSLER NEEDS TO STEP UP AND BACK THEIR NAME UP BY TAKING CARE OF THIS PROBLEM, NOT JUST FOR ME, BUT FOR EVERYONE WHO HAS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  PLEASE HELP!

MY VEHICLE'S ENGINE HAS BEEN PROPERLY MAINTAINED FOR THE FOUR YEARS I'VE OWNED IT.  I'VE KEPT THE OIL CHANGED EVERY 3,000 MILES, HAVE RUN ONLY HIGH OCTANE FUEL IN IT, AND PUT LESS THAN 10,000 MILES A YEAR ON IT.  MY 17 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS ALLOWED TO DRIVE IT TO HER DENTAL APPOINTMENT WHICH IS THIRTY MILES FROM OUR HOMETOWN.  HOWEVER, SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY.  SHE CALLED AND TOLD ME THE ENGINE WAS \"BANGING,\" AND I DON'T MEAN SLANG FOR AWESOME.  SO, SHE TOOK HER OLD MAXIMA WITH OVER 200,000 MILES TO HER DENTAL APPOINTMENT, AND WHEN I GOT HOME, I FOUND OUT WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT.  THE ENGINE HAS THROWN A ROD.  I CALLED CHRYSLER TO ASK IF THERE IS A RECALL ON THE VEHICLE SINCE I RESEARCHED MY PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT MY ENGINE FAILURE IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT.  I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY THAT I HAVE NO WARRANTY ON THE VEHICLE, BUT AT SUCH A LOW AMOUNT OF MILES, I ASSUMED THAT DODGE HAD REALIZED THAT THEY HAVE AN OBVIOUS MECHANICAL OR ENGINEERING DEFECT THAT NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED.  UNFORTUNATELY, CHRYSLER DOES NOT AGREE.  AFTER TALKING TO SEVERAL AGENTS AT CHRYSLER, I WAS ASSIGNED A CASE MANAGER WHO HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT I WAS ON MY OWN, BUT THEY WANTED TO OFFER ME FOUR COMPLIMENTARY OIL CHANGES!  I DID NOT MAKE THAT UP.  FOUR OIL CHANGES FOR MY BLOWN ENGINE.  I'VE BABIED THIS VEHICLE; MOST OF THE MILES ON MY DURANGO HAVE BEEN HIGHWAY MILES.  I'VE ONLY HAULED A TRAILER A HANDFUL OF TIMES.  THIS VEHICLE SHOULD NOT BE WORN OUT.  I STILL HAVE TWO YEARS TO PAY ON IT.  AS A POOR SCHOOL TEACHER WHO RELIED ON THIS VEHICLE FOR TRANSPORTING HIS FAMILY SAFELY, I AM SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED WITH CHRYSLER'S CHOICE TO IGNORE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS VERY SAME PROBLEM OF COUNTING ON CHRYSLER TO PROTECT OUR FAMILIES WITH A RELIABLE VEHICLE BUILT TO SAFELY CARRY OUR FAMILIES IN TRAFFIC AND THROUGH ALL TYPES OF WEATHER.  *TR",

THE RECALL WAS FOR A WIRING CLUSTER BEHIND THE INSTRUMENT PANEL , IT WOULD MALFUNCTION RESULTING IN A FIRE. RECENTLY WHILE ON A CAMPING TRIP WITH MY CHILDREN, BROTHER AND SISTER IN LAW AND MY SISTER AND HER FAMILY THE CAR CAUGHT FIRE. IT HAD BEEN PARKED SINCE APPROXIMATELY 5:00  THE DAY BEFORE. WE WOKE UP ON SUNDAY MORNING AND WERE STANDING AROUND THE CAMPFIRE AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE HORN ON MY CAR BEEPED. I IMMEDIATELY CHECKED TO MAKE SURE ALL THE KIDS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AND THEY WERE. MY 12 YEAR OLD SON RAN DOWN AND YELLED BACK THE CAR WAS ON FIRE. I LOOKED DOWN AND SAW FLAMES SHOOTING FORM THE WINDSHIELD AND THE TOP OF THE CAR. NONE OF US HAD A FIRE EXTINGUISHER BUT SOMEONE YELLED GRAB THE COOLERS BECAUSE IT HAD BOTTLED WATER IN THERE. WE QUICKLY DOUSED THE FIRE WITH WATER AND EXTINGUISHED IT. THE FIRE DEPT. CAME OUT AND SAID THEY BELIEVED THE FIRE STARTED BEHIND THE INSTRUMENT PANEL IN THE DASH. I FILED A REPORT WITH MY INSURANCE AND THE ADJUSTER LOOKED AT THE CAR AND TOTALED AND CONCURRED WITH WHAT THE FIRE DEPT. HAD SAID. I FILED A CLAIM WITH CHRYSLER AND THEIR RESPONSE TO ME WAS THAT \"YOUR CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY,WE'RE SORRY BUT WE CAN'T HELP YOU\". I AM HIGHLY UPSET ABOUT THIS. IF I HAD BEEN DRIVING THIS CAR WHEN THE PROBLEM OCCURRED NOT ONLY WOULD I HAVE NOT MADE IT OUT BUT MY FOUR CHILDREN(TWO OF WHOM ARE IN CAR SEATS) WOULD HAVE MET CERTAIN DEATH. I NEED YOUR HELP INVESTIGATING THIS. MY CAR IS AT A SALVAGE LOT IN GREENSBORO, NC AND THIS NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED. CHRYSLER DIDN'T EVEN TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK AT IT.

I HAD TO TURN INTO TRAFFIC AND ALMOST HAD AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF THIS.  THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS IN MY OPINION AND IT LOOKS LIKE MANY OTHERS ARE HAVING SIMILAR ISSUES.  I AGREE WITH SOME OF THE OTHERS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL.  IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT. *TR",

WE WOULD NEED A NEW BATTERY AND CABLE. I CALLED THE GARAGE TO INFORM THEM THAT A NHTSA SAFETY RECALL D40 WAS ISSUED IN 2004, CONCERNING RE-ROUTING THE BATTERY CABLE AS IT COULD LEAD TO AN UNDERHOOD FIRE. I WAS EXPECTING NOT TO BE CHARGED WITH THE BATTERY AND REPLACEMENT CABLE. HOWEVER THE RECALL NOTICE TALKS ABOUT CABLE CONTACT WITH THE UPPER CONTROL ARM OF THE SUSPENSION AND IN MY CASE THE CONTACT WAS WITH THE EXHAUST GAS RECYCLE TUBE, WHICH IS 1\" AWAY FROM THE CONTROL ARM.

SINCE THAT TIME, NONE OF THE INTERIOR LIGHTS COME ON WHEN OPENING THE DOOR. ALSO, ON THE AWD AND 4WD SWITCH PANEL, THE NEUTRAL LIGHT STAYS ON ALL THE TIME. THE ALARM ALSO GOES OFF WHEN USING THE KEY. WE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER ON 1/2/2007, AND THEN HAD TO BRING IT BACK THE NEXT DAY FOR AN ACTUAL APPOINTMENT. THEY INFORMED US THAT THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER PANEL, WHICH IS WHAT IS CAUSING THE ISSUE, IS ON BACK ORDER, AND WE HAVE TO WAIT 3 WEEKS TO TAKE IT IN SO THEY CAN ORDER PARTS. WE WILL HAVE TO HAVE A RENTAL CAR AS IT WILL TAKE POSSIBLY 4 DAYS, AND APPARENTLY WE CANNOT ACCRUE MILES ON THE DURANGO DURING THAT TIME. IN THE MEANTIME, WITH THE OTHER COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE BEEN FILED WITH SIMILAR PROBLEMS LIKE THIS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF FIRES, WE ARE LEAVING THE CAR OUT IN THE DRIVEWAY JUST IN CASE.  *NM",

THE SOCCER COMPLEX IS LOCATED OFF OF MCCARTY ROAD BETWEEN BAY ROAD AND MACKINAW.  HER TEAM WAS SCHEDULED TO PLAY AT 7:30PM.  WE WERE INSTRUCTED TO BE AT THE COMPLEX FORTY FIVE MINUTES PRIOR TO GAME TIME.  WE DEPARTED OUR HOME AT 6:30PM FOR THE 10 MINUTE DRIVE TO THE COMPLEX.  WE PARKED IN AN OVERFLOW TOURNAMENT PARKING LOT TO THE EAST OF THE COMPLEX.  THE LOT WAS LOCATED OFF OF MCCARTY ROAD BETWEEN CABARET TRAIL W. AND FORTUNE BLVD.  WE PULLED OFF MCCARTY ROAD AND PARKED AT APPROX. 6:45PM.  AS I TURNED THE VEHICLE IGNITION OFF, MY WIFE AND I NOTICED SMOKE COMING FROM UNDERNEATH THE DASH BOARD.  IT APPEARED THAT THE SMOKE WAS COMING FROM THE INSTRUMENT PANEL.  AT THAT POINT, MY WIFE AND I INSTRUCTED THE TWO OLDER CHILDREN TO EXIT THE VEHICLE IMMEDIATELY.  MY WIFE ASSISTED OUR 4 YEAR OLD OUT OF HER CAR SEAT.  ONCE EVERYONE HAD CLEARED THE VEHICLE, I OPENED THE HOOD OF THE VEHICLE TO CHECK FOR SMOKE IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  I SAW NO SMOKE IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  ALTHOUGH, I DID SEE A SMALL AMOUNT OF SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE VENTS LOCATED NEAR THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS.  I THEN PROCEEDED TO THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE.  AT THIS TIME THE SMOKE WENT FROM A WHITE/GREY COLOR TO BLACK.  MY FIRST RESPONSE WAS TO ORDER MY FAMILY TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE.  I THEN CALLED 911 AT 6:48PM TO REPORT A POTENTIAL FIRE IN THE VEHICLE.  SHORTLY AFTER THE CALL TO 911, A ROUND FLAME SHOT THROUGH THE DASH (BEHIND THE DRIVER INSTRUMENT PANEL) TO THE WINDSHIELD GLASS.  AT THIS POINT I INSTRUCTED MY FAMILY TO GET AS FAR AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE AS POSSIBLE.  I MADE A SECOND CALL TO 911 TO REPORT THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOW ON FIRE.  THE VEHICLE WAS ENTIRELY BURNT WITHIN 10-12 MINUTES.  *NM",

REASON FOR FAILURE - BAD SENSOR. DROVE HOME, LIGHT BACK ON.TOOK IT TO  ARRIGO. THEY KEPT IT FOR A WEEK.

DEFEATED ELECTRONIC AND/OR WIRING CAUSING A HIGH SAFETY RISK WHILE DRIVING OR TO DRIVE.   ISSUE: VEHICLE DEFEATED ELECTRONIC/WIRING CAUSES THE REMOTE KEYLESS ENTRY (KEY), THE OVER HEAD CONSOLE (COMPASS, TEMPERATURE, MINI-TRIP COMPUTER), AND THE HEATER/AC TO BECOMES INOPERATIVE.  THE DEFEATED SYSTEMS, WHICH FIRST OCCURRED THREE WEEKS AFTER THE PURCHASE DATE AND RANDOM AFTERWARDS UNTIL NOW, ARE AS FOLLOW:    WHILE DRIVING WITH HEATER/AC UNIT ON OR OFF, ALL THREE AREAS IDENTIFIED IN THE ISSUE ABOVE BECOMES INOPERATIVE OR SHUTS OFF.  THEN SUDDENLY, THE VEHICLE (HEATER/AC) BLOWER UNIT STARTS BLOWING, ON HIGH, HOT AIR (20 MINUTES DURATION UNTIL NOW). VEHICLE HAVE TO BE MANUALLY OPEN BY KEY AND ALARM TURN OFF BY TURNING THE IGNITION (WHICH WILL START THE DEFAULT BLOWER TO BLOW HIGH HOT AIR).

PETE, SERVICE MANAGER), HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM/DEFEAT COULDN'T BE IDENTIFY BECAUSE OF THE RANDOM OCCURRENCE.

I'M NOT GETTING ANY ASSISTANCE BUT REMINDED THAT MY WARRANTY HAD RAN OUT AND IT'S ON ME.  I REQUEST THIS SAFETY ISSUE/VEHICLE DEFEAT BE INVESTIGATED.

I ASKED MY SON TO CHECK IT OUT & HE AGREED THAT\"SOMETHING\" WAS WRONG.  A FEW DAYS LATER I HAD A PASSENGER IN THE VEHILCE WITH ME & THAT PESON NOTED THE STICKING TOO. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO BROWN'S DODGE IN CHANTILLY, VA.  HAD THE VEHICLE FOR A FEW DAYS & DECIDED THE STEERING ARM WAS BAD.  PART HAD TO BE ORDERED BUT I COULD DRIVE THE VEHICLE.SAFELY. REPAIR MADE IN LATE JAN. WHEN I PICKED THE VEHICLE UP, SERVICE WRITER TOLD ME THAT REPLACING THE STEERING ARM HAD NOT CORRECTED THE PROBLEM.  THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG & WAS TOLD THAT CHRYSLER WAS WORKING ON THE PROBLEM & \"THAT THE VEHICLE WAS SAFE TO DRIVE.\"I TOOK THE VEHICLE HOME & WAITED FOR THE DEALERSHIP TO CALL ME BACK. I DID NOT HEAR FROM CHRYSLER OR FROM MY DEALERSHIP.2 WEEKS AGO, I WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE & LOST TOTAL STEERING POWER IN THE FRONT END IN TRAFFIC IN ALEXANDRIA, VA. I WAS ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE OFF THE ROAD.NO ONE WAS HURT OR INJURRED.  I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED MY SERVICE ADVISOR& WAS TOLD, TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE TO THE NEAREST CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP. BUT NOT TO TELL ANYONE ABOUT THE STEERING PROBLEM OR ABOUT CHRYSLER'S INVOLVEMENT.  HE ACTUALLY TOLD ME TO\"PLAY DUMB'.  WHICH PISSED ME OFF TO THE POINT THAT I WANTED TO RUN HIS SORRY ASS OVER.  BUT,INSTEAD OF DOING THAT, I HAD THE CAR FLAT-BEDDED BACK TO BROWN'S DULLES DODGE.  WHERE IT STILL IS TO THIS DAY.  I HAVE HAD MINIMAL CONTACT WITH CHRYSLER.I CAN TELL THEY ARE STONEWALLING ME.  A BIG KAHUNNA TECHNICAL ADVISOR CAME IN TO TOWN EARLIER THIS WEEK.  BUT ALL I GOT WAS CRAP OUT THE SIDES OF MY SERVICE ADVISOR'S MOUTH.THIS VEHICLE HAS A PROBLEM.  THE SERVICE ADVISOR TOLD ME THAT THE GUY WHO CAME IN TO CHECK IT OUT DROVE QUITE A FEW OF THE NEW DODGE DURANGOS & ALMOST ALL OF THEM HAD THE SAME STEERING PROBLEM, MINE WAS WORSE.",

FOLLOWING WEEK I NOTICED THAT GAS MILEAGE WAS BELOW 10MPG'S WHICH WAS   ABNORMAL BUT DEALER STATED THAT IT WOULD GET BETTER.   A FEW DAYS LATER WHILE ACCELERATING ON INTERSTATE 80 THE ENGINE STARTED BUCKING AND CHUGGING AND THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND STARTED BLINKING.....  I PULLED TO THE SHOULDER AND TURNED OFF VEHICLE.   I GOT THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER AND THEY FOUND FROM THE COMPUTER THAT THE CYLINDERS WERE MISFIRING.  THEY PULLED THE PLUGS OUT OF THE BLOCK AND NOTED RUST AND CORROSION ALONG WITH OXIDATION COVERING THE SPARKPLUGS AND THE EXTENSION TUBES HOLDING THE SPARK PLUGS.  THEY FOUND THAT WATER WAS GETTING INTO THE FIRING AREA OF THE SPARKPLUG .  HOWEVER, IT WAS SAID TO ME BY THE WARRANTY MANAGER FROM THE NORTHEAST BUSINESS CENTER FOR CHRYSLER THAT HE HAD MY PHOTOS SENT TO DETROIT AND THAT ENGINEERS WERE NOW DESIGNING A DEFLECTOR SHIELD FOR THESE DURANGOS WHICH WOULD SOMEHOW KEEP WATER FROM GETTING TO PLACES IT SHOULD NOT BE.  AS A CERTIFIED SAFETY PROFESSIONAL, #9937,  I INVESTIGATE FATALITIES AND INJURIES REGULARLY.  IT IS MY JOB TO TRY TO ARRIVE AT THE ROOT CAUSE OF ACCIDENTS AND INCIDENTS.    IN THIS CASE, A SERVICE MANAGER FROM CORIGLIANO DODGE, BELIEVE OTHER VEHICLES MAY HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND THAT IT COULD BE RELATED...THAT IS THE WATER NOT BEING KEPT WAY FROM THE INNERDS OF THE ENGINE...COULD BE RELATED TO THE THROTTLE CABLE GETTING WATER IN IT AND WHEN SUBJECT TO FREEZING TEMPS, IT COULD STICK CAUSING AN ACCIDENT.  WATER IN AN ENGINE HERE GOT THE THROTTLE TO STICK WHEN MIXED WITH COLD TEMPERATURES.  IT GOT MY ENGINE CYLINDERS TO MISFIRE AND WHAT ABOUT STEERING OR ELECTRICAL FIRES.  CHRYSLER MUST HAVE SOME OVERSIGHT FROM YOUR AGENCY ON THIS AND PLEASE CONTACT ME SO I CAN EMAIL DIGITAL PHOTOS TO YOU THAT I TOOK THAT DAY IN THE CORIGLIANO DODGE OF BOONTON , NJ SHOP.  *AK",
