Traffic was piled up behind me. I took it to a local auto store that will run engine checks for free. No problems were found. The employee said it just registered \"recharge battery\". The car had no more problems that day. I did report it and was supposed to \"stop by dealership\" in the next few days, as this was \"not a safety issue and it could be recharged quickly\". The next evening, my daughter drove me to the store for some needed items. On the way back, she was slowly veering right at a yield sign and the engine cut off again. It was dark and the way the road curved, cars coming from behind us would not be able to see us. We were afraid that we would be hit from behind, causing injury to us and anyone in the other vehicle. The car would not restart. As the car was still slightly rolling, my daughter tried to veer over into a parking lot, to get us to safety. In the darkness, she was unable to see a ditch beside the entrance of parking lot and we fell straight into it, headfirst. We called for a sheriff's deputy, who came quickly. He mentioned that we were not in a safe area for \"strangers\". He placed his car, with his lights flashing, in the lane, near the intersection, in order to alert drivers coming near. I was told to have it towed to dealership. (I had just purchased it 12/24/2021.) Deputy did not make a formal report, as he stated their policy is to NOT do that in accidents with just one car. We had the car towed as instructed and a friend came to drive us home. This started a long, legal process with the dealership, which I can give further details on, if needed. My daughter and I could have easily been hit from behind. We could have been severely injured or lost our lives. An unsuspecting driver veering right at that intersection could have had the same fate, as it was too dark to see our car.",

My father came to get the car and the check engine light came on.  My father used an OBD meter and determined the car was misfiring once again.  He was going to replace the coils himself, called Hyundai to see how much they would charge and was told that it was under warranty. Hyundai ended up replacing 4 coils.  The coils placed installed in November did not meet the  new coils that Hyundai is now using as OEM parts.    Seems like this should be a recall if Hyundai knows that the coils delivered with the car our faulty.

A week or 2 later, the problem would happen again. I have had to take my car to the shop 5 major times. My safety, my child\u2019s safety, and husband\u2019s safety have been placed in jeopardy. I am very afraid to even step foot in the car. The problem has never been fixed. My car is currently at the dealership receiving service for the same issue. I am still paying on the car and it hasn\u2019t worked for almost 2 years.

This is also not covered under warranty and list below of why it should be: This can cause Engine misfiring in a vehicle whose ignition coils have failed. Trying to start the engine of such a vehicle will result in engine misfiring that sounds like a coughing, sputtering noise. When driving at high speeds, jerking and spitting will be seen in the behavior of the vehicle. A vehicle with a failed ignition coil will also result in vibration when it is idling at a stop sign or light. Driving with a faulty coil pack can damage other components of the engine. Also most cars will register a faulty coil and immediately stop gas feed to that cylinder. However, damage may be caused if the fault isn\u2019t registered by the PCM and the dead cylinder continues to receive gas. Your catalytic converter and oxygen sensors may become contaminated by raw gas and need to be replaced. This can be dangerous if it is a known common issue in a Hyundai Elantra and cause an accident when travelling at a higher speed.

It was a danger should my car refused to accelerate while making a turn, merge, etc.  On 8/31, I brought my car to Healey Hyundai.  However, Healey could not fix the car, as the error codes were not in the car.  On 9/6 I was able to drive to Healey Hyundai within the same day of the issue.  The error code, a misfire on cylinder 2.  On 9/16, Hyundai Motor Corp recognized there was a premature failure of the ignition coil on cylinder 2.  A warranty repair was done to replace the ignition coil.  Once fixed, a representative from Healey Hyundai acknowledge they had seen this issue before.  They went so far as to warn me that the other ignition coils could go at any time.  On 9/27 at 11 am, the issue occurred again and worse than I ever experienced it.  The engine light turned on and my car struggled to move.  For 15 minutes until I was able to safely stop.  Once off, the light went away, and it appeared to operate normally.  On 9/28 at 1 pm, I brought the car to Healey Hyundai again.  It was 26 hours, 30 miles, and 4 starts since the issue occurred.  However, the error codes were again missing from the car.  Healey Hyundai was not able to reproduce.  And while I have felt the car shutter and hesitate since, it is not enough for the engine light to turn on.  The original ignition coils installed in the car are faulty.  They overheat during normal use causing them to melt and warp.  It also explains why the issue has decreased as the weather cools.  Also alarming is the excessively short period of time error codes are stored in the computer.  It is a matter of time till my car fails again and I am afraid for my safety when it does.",

Then I told him my other tires also had the same cracking or dry rot on them.  I do not know a thing about tires I thought that was normal wear and tear.  I told my father I have already replaced two of these tires on my ELANTRA I have owned a year because the garage said the tires were unsafe; I had no idea what \"DRY ROT.\"   Now that this \"DRYROT\" was pointed out to me I realized the other tires I replaced also had that cracking all around the tire and I am going to look for old pictures that will verify this. IN the meantime once again It looks like I am going have to purchase another new tire because of this irregular tire wear .  Today I discovered there is a recall on the exact same tires I have on my car; two of which I have already replaced.  This recall on the HANKOOK VENTUS S1 noble 2 tire seems to go by tire size and maybe my tire size is not on that recall but I have the same problem as you can see from my photos as described on the recalled HANKOOK VENTUS S1 noble 2 and it is an obvious problem with more than a select few tire sizes.  Please look at pictures of my defective tire; I have already replaced two others, on a car that has 38,000 miles on car; and I have always rotated my tires every other change. Given I have already replaced two of these defective HANKOOK VENTUS S1 noble 2 tires already, I still have two HANKOOK VENTUS S1 noble 2 one is a size 225/40R18 88W and the other is 225/40ZR18 92W.",

I drove it the next day to my mechanic and he said there were no stored codes, he drove it and said he could do nothing. I drove it the next day and the same problem happened, luckily on a side street. Took it back to him and made him drive it around for a 4 day period nothing happened. My son drove it and the same issue happened luckily on a side street. I then took it to the Hyundai dealer and they said they got a misfire code. They replaced the remaining coils, changed the engine coolant and cleaned the fuel injection system. Maybe me wait practically 2 weeks with no loaner. Drove the car and the same issue occurred. Again luckily on a side street. I called my mechanic and he said drive locally and if it happens to call him so he will hook up a scanner to get a code. Right in my neighborhood the same thing happened so I called him and he was unable to get a code, he thought it could be either cam or crankshaft sensor, he tried both and the stall occurred when he was driving, he then changed the MAP sensor and drove it for 30 minutes without an issue. I went away for 5 days and came back and drove the car which seemed fine, but the same problem happened. This is a dangerous problem and feel unsafe driving this car. It has only 46.000 miles on it.

        "summary": "**NON SAFETY ISSUE** Purchased my 2017 Hyundai Elantra SE (Pearl White) used back in August of 2019 with around 30,000 miles on it. No issues at all. After one year back in summer of 2020 I got out my car and noticed a chunk of paint missing from my roof (around the size of half a football). I was immediately concerned. I contacted the dealer I got it from, they advised me to contact Hyundai so I contacted my local Hyundai dealer and they told me I was over the 30,000 mile paint warranty, nothing could be done but they could get me an estimate. I did some research, found tons of articles with tons of people having the same issue, same location on same vehicle, same color. I also found a article about a lawsuit filed against Hyundai for Elantra's year 2009-2016 for paint issue. I saw Hyundai won based off the fact they offer a 30,000 mile paint warranty. This scared me away from trying to pursue Hyundai so I waited a bit and hoped to see if a recall would be issued. Then maybe 4 months ago I went to wash my car and after hitting it with water a softball size chunk of paint chipped off my driver door. I then contacted Hyundai and asked that something be done. Hyundai's body shop wrote an estimate and submitted it to Hyundai. It was an over priced estimate in my opinion so I took it to my local (and well respected) body shop and they wrote me an estimate for exactly half the cost. Hyundai then responded they would cover half the cost. But only at a Hyundai body shop. Either shop I take it to I would owe $1,000 out of my pocket. Unacceptable to me and a lot of money for me. Both shops stated it was a manufacturing defect and I believe the manufacturer should cover the costs. I tried contacting Hyundai's corporate line and they advised me a rep would call me to speak to me about their decision. It has been a month now and no response still. I don't know what to do or who to have help. The car is all but 4 years old and the paint is getting worse daily. I need help.",

The mileage on the car is just over 60,000 and is not covered under warranty anymore. Considering the rear doors are rarely used in this vehicle, we were shocked to see that there were problems with such little use over a short time.   After doing further research on this problem, we found that there are many Hyundai owners that have been having this similar issue on all of the passenger doors.  It scares me to think that this might happen in the future when we won\u2019t be as lucky if there's an accident and have to exit the car quickly.

I had to immediately veer off the highway to avoid hitting somebody and noticed that the electronics were working. I then restarted the car and drove home through local backroads where the car kept shutting off intermittantly. I then took my car to a mechanic who notified me there was sludge in the engine and he had 3 to 4 other customers he recently has seen this happen to in regards to Hyundai Elantra\u2019s. I tried to contact the dealership who accused me of not taking care of my vehicle. I currently have an ope case with Hyundai corporate. From what I\u2019ve seen online Hyundai is aware of these engine issues about piston knock and wngine sludge due to piston issues yet has not offered a recall or any type of customer assistance. The engine failure could have not only grievously injured my family but any other drivers I may have hit or been hit by due to this known engine issue.",

        "summary": "Issue 1:  The brakes are locking up when used at a high rate of speed (high-ways/interstate).  When braking and running over a slight bump in the road such as where the road has buckled due to heat or due to road repair work (or other larger bumps), the anti-lock brake system will lock up the tires which will cause the car to continue traveling at a high rate of speed without slowing effectively.  It has almost caused several collisions by failing to brake in time to avoid hitting the car in front of it without switching lanes.  Luckily, no cars have hit the Elantra when we have had to swerve last minute to avoid a crash that would normally be avoided.  This has happened on the interstate in traffic and sudden stops by cars in front of us.  It has also happened on off ramps while gradually slowing the vehicle to a stop.  This could cause substantial injury or death to anyone in the car.    I have taken this car to the dealership and multiple car repair shops.  They have not been able to determine the cause or fix the issue.  There are no warnings on the car.  The first few times this happened the antilock brake light came on.  Issue 2:  The back passenger door will not open when using the door latch from the inside or the outside of the car.  The car lock functions as normal and can be heard locking and unlocking.  The door will not open to be able to be fixed.  Hyundai will not repair the issue under the warranty, and has quoted a high sum to fix the issue.  The technician said he would have to brake the door in order to fix the issue.  Other car repair shops have confirmed this is a common problem with Hyundai vehicles.  The other repair shops have not been able to open the door to fix the issue.  There is not a recall on the door mechanism.  This has not caused any damage or injury to a person as of yet, but we have not felt comfortable driving anyone in the Elantra as the door would not open in an emergency to allow someone to get out of the car.",

WITHIN 15 MINUTES OF PULLING OFF OF THE PARKING LOT, MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT FLASHED BACK ON AND MY CAR BEGAN TO SHAKE AND LOSE SPEED AGAIN. I TURNED AROUND IMMEDIATELY AND TOOK MY CAR BACK.
