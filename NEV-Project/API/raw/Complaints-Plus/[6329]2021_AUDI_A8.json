        "summary": "I was driving in the morning on a November day on a rural road. The rear moon roof exploded outward. The sound was deafening and scared my passenger and I. The center glass exploded outward, scattering glass outside and inside of the car. I believe that if this happened that passengers in the car could be hurt. Other drivers on the highway could be startled on their car damaged by the flying glass. An accident could be induced by the incident either by the drive of my car or by  nearby drivers.",
