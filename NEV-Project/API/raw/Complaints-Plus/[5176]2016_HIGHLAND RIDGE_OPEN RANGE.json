        "summary": "FRAME CRACKING IN SEVERAL PLACES AROUND SPRING SHACKLES, BETWEEN TIRES.  STARTED AS STRESS FRACTURES.  NOW HOLES AND CRACKS 12 INCHES LONG.  I HAVE CONTACTED HIGHLAND RIDGE, LIPPERT FRAME COMPANY, SALES POINT.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST MY RV.  HOWEVER AFTER LIPPERT SENT ME AN EMAIL TELLING ME THEY WOULD NO LONGER COMMUNICATE WITH ME.  THEY INSTRUCTED ME THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE FOR HIGHLAND RIDGE TO HANDLE.  I WENT ON A SPREE.  I STOPPED EVERY OPEN RANGE 5TH WHEEL, TRAILER I COULD.  ASKED THE OWNERS IF I COULD SLIDE UNDER THEIR RV AND CHECK THE FRAME.  NEARLY ALL OF THE RV'S HAD CRACKED FRAMES IN THE SAME PLACES.  I RECONNECTED ALL PREVIOUS AGENCIES TO INFORM THEM OF WHAT I FOUND.  NEW PICTURES OF UPDATED ISSUES.  LIKE TIRES RUBBING ON FRAME WHEN DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY TURNING CORNERS.  TIRES WEARING OUT EXCESSIVELY AND IN ODD PATTERNS.  THEY ALL HAVE THROWN THEIR HANDS IN THE AIR.  THEY ARE NOT CONCERNED OF THE ISSUE.  IF YOU LOOK ON THE WEB BOTH COMPANIES HAVE SEVERAL COMPLAINTS.  ESPECIALLY LIPPERT.  THE 316 AND 345 FRAMES ARE SHARED BY ALL MANUFACTURES.   SO ITS NOT JUST A PROBLEM WITH HIGHLAND.  IT CROSSES OVER TO BIG HORN, COUGARS, 32 TO 36 FOOT 5TH WHEELS AND TRAILERS.      THE DAMAGE IS DONE WHEN YOU ARE BACKING INTO RV SPACES.  THE SPRING SHACKLES ROLL THE BOX RECTANGLE TUBING.  THIS TUBING IS MOUNTED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE RV I BEAM.  THE ROLLING IS LITERALLY TEARING THE WEB OF THE I BEAM.  CRACKING THE BOTTOM FLANGE OF THE I BEAM OFF THE WEB.  DURING TURNS AT HIGHWAY SPEED THE RV ROLLS AND PITCHES.  SOMETIMES YOU CAN SEE THE TIRES OUTSIDE OF THE WHEEL WELL.  ROLLING THE SHACKLES AS MUCH AS 4 INCHES SIDE TO SIDE.  WHEN LEAVING PARKING LOTS IT IS REALLY NOTICEABLE.   THE RV ROCKS BACK AND FORTH EVEN AFTER STRAIGHTENING OUT.      BOTH COMPANIES BLAME EACH OTHER.  IT'S LIKE 3RD GRADE PLAY GROUND ARGUMENT.  I HAVE OTHER OWNER INFO",
