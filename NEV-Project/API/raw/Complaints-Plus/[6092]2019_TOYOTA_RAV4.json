This led to cracking of hinges and brackets, and mis-alignment of the hatch which prevented it from closing and latching.  The original estimate for repairs would have made the owner liable for thousands of dollars.  After reviewing evidence that this was not due to an accident or other abuse, Toyota agreed to a one-time 'goodwill' financial adjustment that reduced owner financial liability.  But as reported in various Toyota owner forums, this is not an isolated incident: hatch opening mechanism failure has been experienced by owners of other Toyota products with various models and model years.  A fundamental design flaw requires a remedy, not just repair to return it to its original, flawed, state.",

The day of incident  I was able to smell gas around engine bay before incident. I was able to smell strong gas smell after incident after I filled more gas in the vehicle most likely from engine bay fresh air intake. My assumption is this is due to bad fuel/air ratio and the result was unburned fuel.   The week before the incident  engine felt it kicked in roughly on its start up (my car is a hybrid).

I took it to Toyota and they determined it was from the sunroof, according to them one of the drains was clogged with leaves and dirt (prior to this I had NEVER opened/used the sunroof, not sure if leaves are able to get in there without ever opening the roof).  They cleaned the water stain and sent me on my way, without checking for water damage. After doing some research online found out this was happening to quite a few frustrated people and seemed to happen in the 2019-2021 RAV4 vehicles, most people were told it was the sunroof but further research revealed the possibility that it was the roof rail that contained bad seals.  The water is now pooling on both A pillars right where the airbags are housed.  I feel there is a good possibility those airbags will not deploy properly in case of an accident.

It was in reverse when it stopped half way and did not finish backing out.  I put it in drive and then in reverse and I was able to back out.  Once out of my driveway, I backed out into the street in reverse. From reverse, I put my car in Drive to start driving on the street. At this point, the car spun out of control and I could not control its movements.  The car turned around on the street and drove into my yard. It ran through the yard, spun around through some hedges, onto my driveway and continued back into the yard.  At this time it hit a tree in the yard, went back on the road, turned into my driveway before coming to a stop. We got out and inspected the damage. The entire front bumper and the assembly was hanging from the body of the car.  The damage was extensive.  Thankfully, no one was on the road and the only damage was to my  car and my yard. shrubs and tree.  This car is a Limited Edition with cameras and braking functions that stop the car if an object comes in its way.  The car kept accelerating and did not brake to avoid collision.  Note: We bought this 2019 RAV4 in March 2019. It was brand new, full loaded with many safety features.  In October of 2019, we heard sounds coming from the front of the car. We took it to Toyota dealership to have it diagnosed. They determined that the Electromagnetic Clutch Assembly needed to be replaced. The car had 7100 miles on the Odometer.",

Sometimes it would take quite a few seconds before it would react if I would turn it a little left or right.   Eventually, it did lock up and caused the horrible accident.

Yes, while driving on the interstate the vehicle began vibrating heavily.    What component or system failed or malfunctioned, and is it available for inspection upon request? Upon inspection it was noticed that the inner tread of the left rear tire was damaged, worn away and scalloped or cupped.  The tire was replaced with a spare, and vehicle driven to the nearest Toyota dealer for service.  The damaged tire is available for inspection.  Has the problem been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer or independent service center? Yes, the servicing dealer informed us that the left rear camber was out of manufacturer specification being -1.8 deg. The minimum allowed is -1.7, and the minimum recommended is -1.3.  We were informed that to be safe the vehicle required repairs; however, they were unable.  We then took the vehicle to the selling dealer who also found the issue and were unable to repair.  Two additional service centers also confirmed the rear camber was out of specifications, and posed a safety risk.  Has the vehicle or component been inspected by the manufacturer, police, insurance representatives or others? Yes, the dealer stated that a manufacturer representative from Toyota inspected the vehicle.   How was your safety or the safety of others put at risk? Safety was compromised as the damage to the tire was severe and hidden.  This damage could have resulted in a loss of control of the vehicle. The vehicle remains in the unsafe condition.

SUBJECT OF RECALL: VEHICLE MAY STALL WHILE DRIVING. \"THE VEHICLE MAY STOP OPERATING (STALL) AND THE DRIVER WOULD BE UNABLE TO RESTART IT\". \"IF A VEHICLE STALL OCCURS WHILE DRIVING, THIS COULD INCREASE THE RISK OF A CRASH\". \"WE WILL NOTIFY YOU AGAIN WHEN THE REMEDY IS AVAILABLE\".I HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH  SINCE IT INVOLVES MY SAFETY AS THE DRIVER. AS STATED THERE IS NO REMEDY. THE 'LIST' AT TOYOTA WAS STARTED IN JAN OF 2020 FOR AFFECTED MODELS. MY CAR WAS ADDED TO THE LIST IN OCT WHICH MEANS I DROVE FOR TWO MONTHS BEFORE BEING NOTIFIED OF A VERY SERIOUS RECALL. THE REPAIR PLAN IS DIVIDED INTO PHASES. MY RAV 4 WAS PHASE 10 (!!) BUT HAS BEEN MOVED TO PHASE 11.  THE TARGET DATE FOR REPAIR IS LATE  MARCH BUT SINCE THERE IS NO FIX FOR THE PROBLEM I DOUBT THIS DATE IS FEASIBLE.  AFTER A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH WITH TOYOTA VIA THE DEALERSHIP AND MY INSISTENCE THAT THE CAR IS A DANGER TO DRIVE, ESPECIALLY ON HIGHWAYS, I LEFT MY CAR AT THE DEALERSHIP AND RECEIVED A LOANER. I AM A 70 YEAR OLD WIDOW  AND SPENDING $36,000 FOR A CAR WAS A VERY BIG DECISION. I AM STILL MAKING MONTHLY PAYMENTS ON A VEHICLE SITTING AT THE DEALERSHIP INDEFINITELY.I HAVE SPOKEN WITH TOYOTA REPRESENTATIVES ABOUT REPURCHASING THE CAR FOR THE PURCHASE PRICE BUT APPARENTLY THEY RARELY DO THIS. THE FACT THERE IS NO REPLACEMENT PART LEADS ME TO CONCLUDE TOYOTA IS RECKLESS AND UNCARING ABOUT THE LIVES OF ITS BUYERS. I HAVE DEALT WITH MANY RECALLS IN MY LIFETIME BUT NOTHING AS FRIGHTENING AS THIS. I FEEL STRONGLY TOYOTA HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE CONSUMER TO OFFER A MONETARY  (REPURCHASE PRICE) SOLUTION TO THE INTERIM RECALL . (I DON'T KNOW HOW TO UPLOAD)",

THE GAS GUAGE STILL SHOWED AS A COUPLE OF LINES BEFORE BEING FILLED YET I COULD GET NO MORE GAS IN THE TANK. ALSO, IT ONLY SHOWED MY VEHICLE RANGE AS 419 MILES. AT 40+ MPG AND A 14.5 GALLON TANK, IT SHOULD SHOW OVER 580 MILES TO EMPTY. THERE IS DEFINETELY AN ISSUE WITH THIS GAS TANK.  I HAVE ATTACHED PICTURES OF THE BEFORE FILL UP, AFTER FILL UP AND THE GAS RECEIPT SHOWING THE AMOUNT OF GAS I COULD GET IT THE TANK WITHOUT RISKING  AN OVERFLOW. I REALLY HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW MUCH GAS IS IN THE TANK OR HOW FAR I CAN EXPECT TO DRIVE BEFORE RUNNING OUT OF GAS.  I HAVE MORE INSTANCES OF THIS, ALL SHOWING THE SAME PROBLEM.",

THE CAR WAS ADVERTISED TO GIVE COMBINED 40 MPG AND HAVE A 14.5 GALLON FUEL TANK.  I NOW HAVE APPROXIMATELY 2 THOUSAND MILES ON THE CAR AND I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME ISSUE EVERY TIME THAT I GET GAS IN MULTIPLE STATES AND GAS STATIONS. THE TANK WILL NOT FILL UP AND THE GAS PUMP SHUTS OFF BEFORE THE TANK IS FILLED.  EVERY TIME THAT I FILL UP, THE FUEL GAUGE ALWAYS STAYS ABOUT 2-3 LINES BELOW THE FULL MARK.  TWO DAYS AGO I DROVE THE CAR UNTIL IT STOPPED DISPLAYING A MILES-TO-EMPTY READING AND SIMPLY READ, 'FUEL NEEDED.'  MINUTES BEFORE GIVING THIS READING, IT SAID THAT I HAD APPROXIMATELY 31 MILES LEFT.  I CHECKED THE TOYOTA REMOTE CONNECT APP ON MY PHONE THE NEXT MORNING AND IT READ THAT I HAD 24 MILES UNTIL EMPTY.  I DROVE TO THE GAS STATION AND WAS ONLY ABLE TO PUT IN 8.9 GALLONS OF GAS BEFORE THE FUEL PUMP SHUT OFF.  I ATTEMPTED TO CONTINUE FUELING TWO MORE TIMES BUT EACH TIME I TRIED TO TOP OFF, I ONLY GOT A LITTLE MORE GAS BEFORE IT KEPT SHUTTING OFF.  AFTER TOPPING OFF TWICE, I ACHIEVE A GRAND TOTAL OF 9.4 GALLONS OF GAS PURCHASED.  IF THE TANK IS SUPPOSED TO HOLD 14.5 GALLONS AND I WAS ONLY ABLE TO ADD 9 TO A CAR THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY ON EMPTY, THAT IS 5 GALLONS OF GAS THAT IS MISSING.  I'M AWARE THAT MANY TOYOTA HAVE APPROXIMATELY 2 GALLONS LEFT IN RESERVE WHEN THE GAS LIGHT GOES ON, HOWEVER, 9+2=12 AND STILL LEAVES THE CAR SHORT OF ABOUT 2 GALLONS OF GAS.  THIS IS DANGEROUS AND IS A SAFETY HAZARD AS IT WILL RESULT IN MANY PEOPLE TRYING TO TOP OFF THEIR GAS BY FORCING FUEL INTO THE TANKS AND BEING UNABLE TO DETERMINE WHEN THE STOP.  THIS CAN CAUSE GAS LEAKS AND AN INCREASE IN EMISSIONS OR RISK OF FIRE.  IT APPEARS THAT MANY OF THE 2019 TOYOTA HYBRIDS THAT WERE BUILT IN JAPAN ARE EXPERIENCING THIS ISSUE.",

FIRSTLY, THE LANE-CENTERING FEATURE ACTIVELY TRIED TO GUIDE MY VEHICLE OUT OF ITS LANE WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY. THIS TYPICALLY OCCURRED WHEN DRIVING ACROSS OVERPASSES WHERE THE PAVEMENT TYPE TRANSITIONED. THE LEFT AND RIGHT LANE MARKINGS WERE PRESENT ON THE PAVEMENT THROUGHOUT THESE EVENTS. THE STEERING WHEEL MOVED WITH FORCE AND SPEED--HAD MY REACTION TIME BEEN HALF A SECOND LONGER, I WOULD HAVE STRUCK VEHICLES NEXT TO ME. SECONDLY, THE VEHICLE'S FULL-RANGE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL BRAKED ABRUPTLY, ESPECIALLY AT LOWER SPEEDS, ON NEARLY EVERY OCCASION WHERE HIGHWAY/CITY TRAFFIC SLOWED OR STOPPED. I WAS NEARLY REAR-ENDED DUE TO THE JERKY ACTIONS OF THE SYSTEM. THE VEHICLES IN FRONT BRAKED SMOOTHLY DURING THESE EVENTS--ONLY MY VEHICLE SLAMMED ON ITS BRAKES WHEN IT COULD HAVE LIGHTLY APPLIED THEM TO SLOW DOWN SAFELY. IT APPEARS THAT TOYOTA MIGHT HAVE MY DATA FROM 3/13/2019, SINCE A STICKER ON THE OVERHEAD CONSOLE STATES: \"VEHICLE DATA TRANSMISSION IS ON! YOUR VEHICLE WIRELESSLY TRANSMITS LOCATION, DRIVING AND VEHICLE HEALTH DATA TO DELIVER YOUR SERVICES AND FOR INTERNAL RESEARCH AND DATA ANALYSIS...\" I HOPE THAT NHTSA CAN WORK WITH TOYOTA TO EXAMINE THESE RECORDS AND IMPROVE THESE SYSTEMS.",
