LUCKILY IT STOPPED WITH A LOUD BRAKING NOISE; I ENDED UP CLOSE TO THE SIDE OF THE STREET BUT STILL NOT CLEAR FROM THE TRAFFIC LANE.  I TRIED TO RESTART AND MOVE OUT OF THE WAY BUT THE ACCELERATION SOUND WAS HORRIBLE AND THE GEAR WAS LOCKED UP.   I OPENED THE HOOD AND CHECKED THE ACCELERATOR CABLE, FLIPPING THE SPRING LOADED CABLE BACK AND FORTH, AND IT SEEMED TO BE LOOSE ON THE CABLE SPOOL. I THEN RE-STARTED THE CAR, BUT IT WAS STILL REVVING VERY FAST, SO I TURNED IT OFF AND CONTINUED FLIPPING THE ACCELERATOR CABLE UNTIL IT APPEARED TO BE TIGHTER. WHEN I RE-STARTED IT THIS TIME IT WAS RUNNING NORMALLY AT REDUCED RPMS ABOUT 30 MINUTES AFTER THE INCIDENT.  I DROVE BACK HOME SLOWLY (ONE MILE AWAY) ON THE CITY STREETS.   I DROVE IT SLOWLY TO AUTO SHOP THE NEXT DAY.  CHECKED BY MTZ AUTOMOTIVE IN MARTINEZ, CALIFORNIA ON FRIDAY, JULY 12, 2013. THEY FOUND NO PROBLEM.  BUT I AM SCARED TO DRIVE. DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO.

IF THAT SHOULD FAIL OR BREAK, ONE HAS TO CLIMB INTO THE REAR AND REMOVE A PANEL SECURED WITH FASTENERS TO RELEASE THE LOCK.

YOUR OFFICE RECENTLY ISSUED A DIRECTIVE TO INSTALL EMERGENCY INTERNAL LOCK RELEASES FOR NORMAL CAR TRUNKS.  HOW DID THE SCION PASS INSPECTION?  I TRIED CONTACTING THE SCION ORGANIZATION ON THIS SUBJECT, AND WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK TO ANYONE WITH ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THIS SUBJECT.  SHOULD YOU CONCUR WITH MY REPORT, PERHAPS SCION COULD BE ENCOURAGED TO PROVIDE A FIX.  *JB",
