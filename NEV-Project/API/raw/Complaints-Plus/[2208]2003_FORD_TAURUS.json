THE CAUSE WAS A BROKEN COIL SPRING WHICH PUNCTURED MY NEW TIRE. 74K MILES. I AM UPSET THAT THE NHTSA HAS INVESTIGATED THIS PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING FOR 15 YEARS WITH FORD TAURUS' VINTAGE 2000 THROUGH 2005 AND CONCLUDED ITS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN \"NO SERIOUS INJURIES OR DEATHS\". PREVIOUSLY I HAD THREE SPRING FAILURES ON ANOTHER (2001) TAURUS. I HAD A FRONT SPRING BREAK AND HAD BOTH FRONT SPRINGS REPLACED. ONE OF THE REPLACEMENT SPRINGS BROKE TWO YEARS LATER. BOTH FAILURES CAUSED TIRE FAILURES.  SHORTLY BEFORE GETTING RID OF THE 2001TAURUS, I NOTICED A REAR SPRING HAD FAILED, BUT DID NOT DAMAGE THE TIRE. I DO EXPECT A FEW \"SERIOUS INJURIES OR DEATHS\" TO OCCUR IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF THIS SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  IT'S TOO BAD SOME OF US WILL HAVE TO SACRIFICE OUR LIVES OR LIMBS FOR THE GOOD OF THE REST OF US. IF SUCH A DREADFUL THING HAPPENS, I FEEL NHTSA  MAY BE EQUALLY LIABLE WITH FORD FOR WRONGFUL DEATH LAWSUITS FOR NOT REQUIRING FORD TO ADDRESS THIS SAFETY ISSUE. IN THEIR INVESTIGATION, NHTSA ALSO MENTIONS THE RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS TOPIC. THAT IS BECAUSE CONSUMERS DO NOT KNOW ABOUT FILING A COMPLAINT WITH THE NHTSA. I ADVISE THE NHTSA TO REQUEST THE NUMBER OF REPLACEMENT PARTS FROM FORD ALONG WITH PARTS SUPPLIERS SUCH AS ADVANCE AND AUTOZONE. I WOULD ESTIMATE MILLIONS OF SPRINGS HAVE BEEN REPLACED FOR JUST THE 2002 AND 2003 MODEL YEARS. I'D BET MY CRAFT BEER MONEY ON IT. BTW, THE TRUE CAUSE OF FAILURE IS THAT ROAD DIRT AND SALT CAUSES THE BALL BEARINGS IN THE MOUNT TO BIND WHICH IN TURN RESTRICTS THE SPRINGS FREE MOVEMENT. THE SPRING DOES NOT RUST, THE BINDING OF THE BALL BEARINGS AGAINST THE SPRING SURFACE CAUSES THE FAILURE.  POOR DESIGN CAUSING A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION IF DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEED.",

IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THE TRANSAXLES IN THESE GENERATION FORD TAURUSES WERE PRONE TO TRANSAXLE FAILURE, AS WERE THE FORD WINDSTARS AS BOTH VEHICLES USED THE SAME TRANSAXLE. UPON STUDYING UP ON THESE PROBLEMS IT SEEMS FORD MOTOR CO. RECALLED THE WINDSTAR AND CALLED IT A BAD TORQUE CONVERTER CAUSING THE PROBLEMS. WHY DID THEY NOT RECALL THE TAURUSES ALSO, ANSWER: AMOUNT OF VEHICLES PRODUCED OF EACH MODEL AND THEIR FEET WERE NOT \"HELD TO THE FIRE\" BY YA'LL AND OUR GOV.. NOW TO GET TO THE LIGHTING PROBLEM: THE MOST SAFETY HAZARDOUS ITEM WHICH HAS BEEN INSTALLED ON VEHICLES IN THE LAST 15-20 YEARS IS THOSE DAMNED \"PLASTIC LENSED HEADLIGHTS\" THAT WITHIN 3 YEARS WILL \"FOG OVER\" TO THE EXTENT THEY DO NOT PRODUCE ENOUGH LIGHT TO BE USEFULL AT NIGHT. OH THEY SAY YOU CAN CLEAN THEM, OF WHICH I HAVE TRIED ON MY TAURUS, TO NOT MUCH AVAIL. I BELIEVE THE AUTO MANUFACTURERS SHOULD BE ORDERED THRU A RECALL FROM YOU TO REPLACE THEM AT NO COST TO US OWNERS. IF YOU WILL CHECK, YOU WILL SEE A REPLACEMENT OF THOSE \"WUNDERFULL\" INVENTION , KNOWN AS BULLCRAP, LENS  WILL SET AN OWNER OF THE VEHICLES AROUND $500 TO $700 PER PAIR INSTALLED. AND MUST BE ADJUSTED BY A DEALERS ONLY EQUIPMENT. I MY SELF DO NOT BELIEVE IN TODAYS WORLD 125,000 - 129,000 MILES IS A LOT. IF THE TRUTH WERE KNOWN THE \"YELLOWED OUT\" HEADLIGHTS HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE OF A LOT OF NITE TIME ACCIDENTS. DO YOUR JOB AND GO AFTER THEM AND MAKE THEM REPLACE WITH NEW TRANSAXLES AND TORQUE CONVERTERS AND AT THE SAME TIME MAKE THEM REPLACE THE YELLOWED OUT HEADLIGHT LENSES.",

THIS MALFUNCTIONING COULD RENDER THE STOP LAMPS INOPERABLE OR CAUSE THEM TO STAY ON ALL THE TIME. THIS COULD CAUSE CONFUSION TO A FOLLOWING DRIVER, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A CRASH.

THIS COULD ALSO CAUSE THE BATTERY TO DISCHARGE. REMEDY: DEALERS WILL REMOVE THE STOP LAMP SWITCH AND ASSOCIATED WIRING ASSEMBLY AND INSTALL A NEWLY DESIGNED STOP LAMP SWITCH AND WIRE ASSEMBLY.

THE RECALL WENT OUT IN APRIL 2004 THE CAMPAIGN # 04V106000. THIS DEFECT CAN CAUSE A CRASH. RECALL ID # 41871 - EXTERIOR LIGHTING:BRAKE LIGHTS:SWITCH HIDE DETAILS RECALL DATE: MAR 02, 2004 MODEL AFFECTED: 2003 FORD TAURUS SUMMARY: CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES ARE BEING RECALLED TO CORRECT A PROBLEM WITH A MALFUNCTIONING STOP LAMP SWITCH AND/OR ASSOCIATED WIRING. THIS MALFUNCTIONING COULD RENDER THE STOP LAMPS INOPERABLE OR CAUSE THEM TO STAY ON ALL THE TIME. THIS COULD CAUSE CONFUSION TO A FOLLOWING DRIVER, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A CRASH. CONSEQUENCES: IN ADDITION, IF THE SWITCH AND/OR ASSOCIATED WIRING FAIL IN THE OPEN POSITION, THE BRAKE LIGHTS WILL NOT ACTUATE AND THE DRIVER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SHIFT THE VEHICLE OUT OF \"PARK\" IF THEY FAIL IN THE CLOSED POSITION, THE BRAKE LIGHTS WILL REMAIN ON, WHICH WILL NOT ALLOW THE SPEED CONTROL TO BE ACTIVATED. THIS COULD ALSO CAUSE THE BATTERY TO DISCHARGE. REMEDY: DEALERS WILL REMOVE THE STOP LAMP SWITCH AND ASSOCIATED WIRING ASSEMBLY AND INSTALL A NEWLY DESIGNED STOP LAMP SWITCH AND WIRE ASSEMBLY. OWNER NOTIFICATION IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN ON APRIL 5, 2004.     INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6),  *TR",

I PARKED MY CAR AT HOME & WENT OUT LATER TO RETRIEVE SOME PAPERWORK FROM MY VEHICLE ONLY TO FIND OUT I HAD A FLAT TIRE. WHEN THE TIRE WAS REMOVED TO SEE WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT & HOPEFULLY JUST HAVING THE TIRE REPAIRED, THAT IS WHEN WE NOTICED THAT THE SPRING HAD BROKE WHILE THE CAR WAS PARKED & PUNCTURED THE TIRE. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE I WAS IN SHOCK, BUT WAS THANKFUL THAT IT HAD NOT HAPPENED WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT 65MPH SHREDDING MY TIRE & POSSIBLY CAUSING A FATAL ACCIDENT. I HAVE SINCE RESEARCHED ON THE INTERNET ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED AND HAS STILL HAD NO RECALL !  IS IT A MATTER OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DEATHS TO OCCUR BEFORE SOMETHING IS DONE ? IT IS A BLESSING THAT THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED YET & YOU WOULD THINK THAT FORD WOULD WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THE SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE WHO BUY THEIR CARS, BY HAVING A RECALL ON THE DEFECTIVE SPRINGS BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED. THERE IS NO WARNING WHEN THIS HAPPENS & I FEEL THAT IT IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR FORD TO PLAY WITH THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE WHO BUY THEIR VEHICLES. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS A GREAT FINANCIAL SET BACK FOR ME & MY 3 CHILDREN & WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE EVER BUYING A FORD VEHICLE AGAIN KNOWING THAT THE OUTCOME COULD HAVE BEEN UNFORGIVABLE.

I HOPE YOU CAN DO SOMETHING TO HELP ME.   *TR",

WHEN I PUSHED ON THE BRAKES, IT TAKES ME ABOUT 3 TIMES AS LONG TO STOP THE CAR AND ONCE IT'S STOP IT IS STILL TRYING TO GO AND THE RPM WAS ABOVE 3. I WAS ALSO PUSHING THE BRAKES AS HARD AS I COULD AND THE CAR WAS STILL TRYING TO GO. THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED WAS IN THE WINTER OF 2010. IT HAPPENED ROUGHLY 5 TIMES IN THE WINTER OF 2010 AND 3-4 TIMES IN THE WINTER OF 2011. IT DID NOT HAPPEN IN 2012 DUE TO THE WARM WINTER CLIMATE, AT LEAST THAT IS MY GUESS. I ALSO REMEMBER IT HAPPENING WHEN IT WAS VERY COLD OUTSIDE. THE ONE TIME IT WAS AROUND 0 DEGREES.  IT FELT LIKE THE PEDAL WOULD GET STUCK. THE ONLY WAY I COULD GET IT TO STOP WOULD BE TO AGGRESSIVELY KEEP PUSHING THE PEDAL AND THEN IT WOULD GET UNSTUCK. ONE TIME I LET IT GO TO SEE HOW FAR IT COULD SPEED UP ON IT'S OWN I GOT IT TO 50 MPH WITHOUT PUSHING THE PEDAL BEFORE I GOT NERVOUS AND WAS ABLE TO GET IT TO STOP. I'VE ALSO NOTICED IN THE PAST THAT THE PEDAL SOMETIMES WILL FEEL LIKE IT WILL GET STUCK BUT IN THOSE CASES THE CAR WON'T ACCELERATE ON IT'S OWN LIKE I EXPLAINED ABOVE. I BROUGHT ALL OF THIS TO THE DEALER'S ATTENTION BUT THEY WROTE ME OFF AND SAID IT COULD HAVE BEEN DUE TO THE COLD. I NEVER THOUGHT TO REPORT IT TILL I HEARD ABOUT OTHER INCIDENTS SIMILAR TO MINE RECENTLY IN THE NEWS.  *TR",

IS IT GOING TO TAKE DEATHS TO MAKE THIS A RECALL, IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS THERE IS A PROBLEM.  MY CAR HAD 52520 MILES ON IT, MOST VEHICLES THIS IS JUST BROKE IN.  CAR COMPLAINTS.COM THERE ARE OVER 200 COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME THING.  IMAGINE GOING 70 ON HIGHWAY SEMI BEHIND YOU ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU SLOW UP HAVE NO WAY TO GET OFF HIGHWAY, I GUESS THE SEMI RUNS OVER TOP OF YOU KILLING YOU AND HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE, EITHER IN YOUR CAR OR CHAIN REACTION.  FORD AND THE NHTSA NEED TO STEP UP, AND HELP OUT.  HOW MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE DID NOT FILE A COMPLAINT, OR KNOW THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE FORD TAURUS.   *TR",

I DID RETURN TO THE DEALERSHIP, THEY LOOKED AT MY CAR AND TOLD ME I HAD A COWL LEAK AND IT WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY $400 TO FIX.  I HAVE NOT HAD IT FIXED BUT I'VE NOTICED FROM READING ABOUT OTHER 2003 FORD TAURUS OWNERS, THEY'VE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM..  IS THERE NOT SOME WAY FORD MOTOR COMPANY SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE AND PAY FOR THESE REPAIRS?  *TR",

I PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND TRIED AGAIN BY PUTTING MY CAR IN REVERSE.  NEEDLESS TO SAY THE CAR WOULD NOT BUDGE.  NO PROBLEMS WERE INDICATED BEFORE THAT DAY.  I CALLED MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP TO ASK THEM ABOUT A POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM, BUT THEY TOLD ME I WOULD HAVE TO BRING MY CAR TO THEIR SHOP.  I SAID 'HOW CAN I BRING MY CAR TO YOUR SHOP WHEN I CAN'T DRIVE IT ANYWHERE SINCE IT WON'T GO IN REVERSE'?  THE PERSON ON THE PHONE TOLD ME I COULD HAVE IT TOWED TO THEIR LOCATION AND WHEN I  ASKED HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION, THE GUY TOLD ME $3500.  YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW SHOCKED I WAS TO HEAR THIS COST!  IN THE MEANTIME A NEIGHBOR CAME TO MY HOUSE AND SUGGESTED I CALL ONE OF MY TOWN'S TRANSMISSION SHOPS.  I DID AND WAS TOLD THE COST TO REPLACE MY TRANSMISSION WOULD BE ABOUT $1500.  I WAS ALSO ASKED HOW MANY MILES I HAD ON MY CAR AND I TOLD HIM 35,000.  HE WAS SHOCKED TO HEAR A TRANSMISSION WAS OUT W/ONLY 35,000 MILES ON MY CAR.  LATER THAT DAY MY CAR WAS TOWED TO A LOCAL TRANSMISSION SHOP AND A NEW TRANSMISSION WAS PLACED IN MY CAR.  FOR ONE WEEK SOMEONE HAD TO TAKE ME TO WORK AND BACK HOME AND AT THE END OF THE WEEK I PAID $1500 AND GOT MY CAR BACK HOME.  DURING THAT WEEK I DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND DISCOVERED OTHER 2003 FORD TAURUS OWNERS WERE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM I HAD W/MY CAR.

FORTUNATELY THE TIRES FAILED IN THE DRIVEWAY AND NOT WHILE SHE WAS ON THE HIGHWAY COMMUTING TO OR FROM WORK. I CALLED THE FORD DEALER AND ASKED IF THERE WAS A RECALL ON THIS FAILURE. THE PERSON SAID THAT THE 'OASIS' SYSTEM DID NOT SHOW ANY RECALLS ON THE SPECIFIC VIN. I THEN ARRANGED FOR THE CAR TO BE TOWED TO MY LOCAL MECHANIC (WHO PREVIOUSLY WORKED AT THE LOCAL FORD DEALER FOR OVER 15 YEARS), SINCE THE FORD DEALER IS EXCESSIVELY EXPENSIVE. HE SAID THAT THE BROKEN SPRINGS (BOTH) TWISTED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CUT BOTH THE FRONT TIRES ON THE INSIDE SIDE WALL. HE ALSO HAD TO REPLACE A SWAY BAR LINK (BROKEN IN THE SPRING FAILURE), AND BOTH FRONT STRUTS BLOWN OUT WHEN THE BROKEN SPRINGS ALLOWED ALL THE CARS WEIGHT TO BOTTOM OUT ON THE STRUTS. THE CAR IS CURRENTLY AT THE TIRE SHOP GETTING TWO REPLACEMENT TIRES (THE BLOWN OUT ONES HAD 70% TREAD REMAINING) AND A FRONT END ALIGNMENT.

I'M AWARE THAT THE FAILURE OF SPRINGS ON FORD'S TAURUS/SABLE, ESCORT/TRACER, AND OTHER FORD MODELS IS NOT UNCOMMON AND HAS BEEN A PROBLEM OVER THE YEARS. THIS SPECIFIC TYPE OF FAILURE, WHERE THE TIRES ARE CUT AND BLOWOUT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED ASAP. I HAVE NOTIFIED FOMOCO AS WELL. *TR",

AFTER TAKING CAR IN NUMEROUS TIMES TO DEALERSHIP WHILE UNDER WARRANTY AND THEY WERE UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE EVEN AFTER HOOKING UP RECORDER.

IF YOUR TAURUS HAS A ROUGH IDLE THAT IS INTERMITTENT AND THE DIAGNOSTIC SAYS THERE IS NO CODE, IT IS PROBABLY THIS PROBLEM AS THE SERVICE BULLETIN FROM FORD INDICATES THAT THE CAM SYNCHRONIZER DOES NOT THROW A CODE TO THE COMPUTER SYSTEM.

ON MAY 19, 2009 IT RAINED FROM SUN UP TO SUN DOWN AND IT WAS FORECASTED TO RAIN THE REST OF THE WEEK, SO MY CHILDREN ASKED ME TO DRIVE THEM TO SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY.  WHEN MY DAUGHTER OPENED THE PASSENGER SIDE DOOR TO GET IN, SHE STEPPED INTO A THREE INCH PUDDLE OF WATER.  AT THE SAME TIME THE BATTERY LIGHT WAS FLASHING ON AND OFF.  ON WEDNESDAY THE 20TH I CALLED THE DRIVE TIME SERVICE CENTER TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THE LEAK LOOKED AT AND REPAIRED.      THE NEXT DAY I TOOK OFF WORK TO TAKE MY CAR IN TO AAMCO TRANSMISSIONS AND WAS TOLD THEY COULD NOT FIND WHERE THE LEAK WAS COMING FROM AND THAT THE ALTERNATOR WAS BAD, BUT THE BATTERY WAS OKAY.  THEY REPLACED THE ALTERNATOR AND SAID I NEEDED TO CALL THE SERVICE CENTER BACK TO FIND ANOTHER REPAIR CENTER TO HAVE THE WATER LEAK CHECKED OUT.  I HAD TO GO ANOTHER DAY CLEANING WATER OUT OF THE CAR AND BUYING AIR FRESHENERS TO RID THE CAR OF A NASTY MILDEW SMELL.    THURSDAY, MAY 21ST I CALLED THE SERVICE CENTER AGAIN AND TOLD THEM WHAT REPAIRS I HAD RECEIVED. *TR",

MY FORD DEALER TOLD ME THERE WERE NO RECALLS FOR THESE PROBLEMS ON MY CAR WHICH IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY  THE WATER LEAKING THROUGH THE CABIN AIR FILTER AREA INTO THE CABIN COMPARTMENT IN MANY 2001-3 TAURUS'S HAVE CAUSED THEIR HEATER BLOWER MOTORS TO BIND OR SEIZE WHICH ALSO BURNS OUT THE BLOWER RESISTOR.

AFTER NOTING A BURNING SMELL SEVERAL TIMES IN MY CAR'S CABIN AFTER STARTING MY HEATER FAN, MY HEATER DEFROSTER BLOWER AT FIRST WOULD NOT WORK- ONLY TO WORK A BIT LATER-UNTIL IT FINALLY CEASED TO WORK COMPLETELY. ON AT LEAST 3 OCCASIONS WHEN THIS HAPPENED MY VISION WHILE DRIVING WAS SEVERELY IMPEDED DUE TO THE WINDSHIELD FOGGING OR ICING UP, AS THE DEAD BLOWER COULD NOT DEFROST IT.   WHEN I PULLED THE HEATER MOTOR AND RESISTOR OUT (STILL WIRED) I DISCOVERED THE CAUSE OF THE BURNING SMELL.

FORD IS WELL ARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND HAS ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN # 04-15-3 TO RESOLVE IT.

I SPENT $373.14 FOR A NEW BLOWER MOTOR, RESISTOR ASSY, WEATHERSTRIP, COWL PANEL AND SEALANT.  ON THE 28TH OF DECEMBER, 2008 MY FRONT PASSENGER FLOOR WAS AGAIN, FULL OF WATER.

HE SAID IT WAS HARD TO SAY.  EVIDENTLY IT WAS \"HARD TO SAY\" BECAUSE IT SAYS RIGHT ON THE RECEIPT \"WATER IN BLOWER CASE\".

THE CAR DID NOT WORK IN ANY GEAR. ONLY 59000 MILES AND HAD BEEN SERVICED REGULARLY. NO ABUSE. TOWED TO FORD DEALERSHIP IN FORT MILL,SC. TOLD ME THE CAR WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY AND TORQUE CONVERTER WAS BAD PLUS TRANSMISSION WAS LIKELY DAMAGED .HAVE TO REBUILD  WHOLE TRANSMISSION. CALLED FORD MOTOR CUSTOMER SERVICE & ASKED FOR SOME HELP SINCE THE MILEAGE WAS SO LOW & THE CAR  NOT PAID FOR. AFTER 2 DAYS SAID NOTHING THEY WOULD DO. THE  BILL WAS $3500 PLUS $250 DIAGNOSTIC AND $80 TOWING.  I AM SINGLE, HAD 2 MORE YEARS TO PAY ON THE CAR. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO LET THE BANK FIGHT IT OUT WITH FORD. I  CALLED AMOCO AND  THEY T WILL FIX FOR APPROXIMATELY . $1650. SO I AM  HAVING  IT REPAIRED.  FORD HAD TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS IN THE CARS AND TRUCKS FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. MANY CIRCULATED ON THE INTERNET WITH TRANSMISSION STORIES. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER FORD.  COULD NOT  BELIEVE THEY WOULDN'T AT LEAST PAY FOR PARTS. I AM GOING TO FILE COMPLAINTS AGAINST FORD EVERYWHERE I COULD .  I WAS GOING TO THE LOCAL TV STATION AND  TELL  MY STORY. PLUS I WILL NEVER MISS A DAY TELLING EVERYONE I MEET OR TALK WITH  FOLKS COUNTRYWIDE AT MY JOB   ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE,  AND   FORDS LACK OF CONCERN. I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED .  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN  BETTER FOR FORD TO HAVE HELPED WITH THE COST, THAN HAVE ME AS THEIR WORST ADVISORY. I WILL NEVER QUIT TELLING MY STORY. I WILL MAKE A BIG IMPACT IN THEIR ALREADY SAGGING SALES. IT WILL TAKE ME YEARS TO PAY THIS OFF &  COULD HAPPEN AGAIN WITH THIS TRANSMISSION TYPE. IF FORD WANTS TO RETAIN THEIR HONOR&  STOP MY TELLING THE STORY, THEN THEY CAN DO THE HONORABLE THING & HELP WITH THEIR  MESS. I CAN COST THEM A LOT MORE THAN A COUPLE OF THOUSAND DOLLARS. *AK",

TOOK THE CAR BACK TO DEALER AND WERE INFORMED THAT THIS WAS NO LONGER A WARRANTY ISSUE, AND WERE CHARGED $ 267.26 FOR A NEW BLOWER MOTOR, TO REPLACE THE ONE DESTROYED BY THE WATER POOLING IN THE HEATER SYSTEM.    WE ARGUED THAT THIS SHOULD BE COVERED BY THE WARRANTY, AS THE CAR HAD BEEN IN TWICE PREVIOUSLY, WHILE UNDER WARRANTY, FOR THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM.   AS THE CAR WAS CLEARLY UNSAFE TO DRIVE IN UPSTATE NEW YORK IN THE WINTER, WE PAID THE DEALER.

BASICALLY ANY OWNER THAT HAS A CAR BUILT BETWEEN THOSE TIMES WILL BE DOOMED TO PAY THIS REPAIR  IF THEY WEREN'T LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE THIS FAIL BEFORE THE WARRANTY EXPIRED.  I THINK THAT'S ABSURD!  I'VE TALKED WITH OTHER OWNERS AND THEY WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO NOTICE THE LEAK BEFORE THEIR BLOWERS WENT OUT.  THE DEALERSHIPS CHARGED THEM UPWARDS OF $100 TO INSTALL THE \"RAINHAT\" KIT.  IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THIS WAS A PROBLEM I WOULD HAVE GLADLY PAID $100 FOR THE KIT RATHER THAN $500.  MY DEALERSHIP EVEN ADMITTED THAT THIS HAPPENS QUITE OFTEN, BUT THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT COST UNTIL FORD ISSUES A RECALL.    AGAIN, THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY FORD.  I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S RIGHT FOR THE CONSUMER TO HAVE TO PAY FOR A PRODUCT DESIGN FLAW.    THE SAFETY CONCERN HERE IS OF COURSE THE WINDSHIELD DEFOGGER NOT BEING ABLE TO OPERATE.",

I AM NOT SURE IF THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO LODGE A COMPLAINT, BUT WOULD DIRECT ME TO THE RIGHT SOURCE IF NOT.*AK    SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 2004, I CHANGED OIL ON MY 2003 FORD TAURUS.  LIKE MANY VEHICLES I HAVE CHANGED OIL ON, I WAS NOT VERY PLEASED WITH THE LOCATION OF THE OIL FILTER.  IT IS LOCATED BENEATH THE MANIFOLD (EXTREME HEAT) AND ABOVE THE SOLENOID FOR THE STARTER.  IT WAS THE SOLENOID THAT I WAS SUSPICIOUS ABOUT AND THAT SUSPICION CAME TRUE SUNDAY EVENING.    WHEN YOU TAKE OFF THE OIL FILTER, OIL DRIPS ONTO THE SOLENOID.  I CANNOT IMAGINE WHY AN ENGINEER WOULD ALLOW A LOCATION FOR A FLAMMABLE LIQUID TO DRIP ONTO A POWER SOURCE.  WHEN I USED A FILTER WRENCH TO GET THE OIL FILTER OFF, THE WRENCH KNOCKED OFF THE PROTECTIVE CAP THAT COVERS THE POWER LEADS AND GROUND TO THE SOLENOID.    WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT WAS NOT A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE.  THE OIL WRENCH AND THE POWER LEADS MADE CONTACT AND IMMEDIATELY STARTED SPARKING.  THE SPARKS IN TURN STARTED A FIRE IN MY ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND MELTED THE METAL BAND THAT SURROUNDS THE OIL FILTER WRENCH.  AS QUICKLY AS I COULD, I GRABBED SOME RAGS AND DOUSED THE FIRE.  AS FAR AS I COULD SEE, NO DAMAGE WAS DONE TO THE ELECTRICAL WIRES.    ASIDE FROM GETTING SHOCKED FROM THE SOLENOID AND GETTING MINOR BURNS I AM OKAY.  HOWEVER, THAT IS NOT THE ISSUE.  WHAT IF I HAD NOT PUT THE FIRE OUT?  WOULD THE CAR AND POSSIBLY MY GARAGE BEEN ENGULFED IN FIRE?    I CONTACTED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WHERE I PURCHASED THE FORD TAURUS (VALLEY FORD, FARGO) AND VOICED MY CONCERN.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN AGREED THAT THIS SOLENOID WAS IN AN AWFUL PLACE.  HE ALSO SAID TO MAKE SURE THE PROTECTIVE CAP WAS PLACED OVER THE TERMINAL LEADS OF THE SOLENOID AGAIN.    PLEASE ADVISE ME AS TO WHAT MY NEXT STEP IS.
