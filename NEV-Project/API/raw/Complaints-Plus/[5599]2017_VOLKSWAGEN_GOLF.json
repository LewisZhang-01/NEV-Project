Raw fuel was also being pumped into the air intake of the engine (where air is supposed to go). Fuel tank was bulging due to the high pressure and could have cracked.  Other symptoms: Had fuel spillback while refueling, and also could not fill the tank because the handle kept clicking. Car was riding rough and jerking randomly.  Failed component: Dealer determined a faulty suction pump was causing liquid fuel to fill the charcoal canister while the car is running. This is the same part that was previously recalled in earlier 2015-2016 Golfs (NHTSA Safety Recall Code: 20Y6, published December 2016). My 2017 Golf (16k miles) was manufactured April 2017 and sold to me in October 2017. On the 2017 Golf, the suction pump is now molded inside the fuel tank in an inaccessible location and cannot be serviced; the entire fuel tank must be replaced.  Reproduction: The dealer disconnected the vent lines from the fuel tank and proved that liquid fuel was venting out of the fuel tank and into the charcoal canister via the suction pump (see attached invoice).  Inspection: The car was not inspected by the manufacturer, only the dealer.  Warnings: There were no warnings or lights. When I first noticed my car jerking, I ran my OBD-II scanner and found a code \"P0461 Fuel Level Sensor Circuit Range/Performance\" but the car did not report this to the driver (see attached image).  Rectifications: The fuel tank should be recalled, and Volkswagen should release a software update to make the P0461 code trigger a Check Engine Light.",

        "summary": "The vehicle had been making mild clunking noises for some time (at least 2.5 years) during some combinations of turns/bumps.  When took to mechanic in January 2020, the sound would not reproduce during test drive, so problem was not diagnosed.  Clunking sound became more pronounced over time, until on 8/27/21 while driving a neighborhood road, there was a loud clank, as if some metal part came loose.  Then there was very loud clunking, as if a metal part was knocking around loose - more pronounced when turning or going over bumps.  Upon inspection by a mechanic later in the day, the sway bar had come loose due to one of the bolts on the driver side sway bar bracket had come out.  Both this mechanic and later, the Volkswagen dealer mechanic, said this was very odd, since they normally only see sway bar damage when a car has been in an accident.  My car has never been in any kind of accident.  Sway bars  help ensure a vehicle doesn\u2019t roll too much when handling turns. Aside from safety, sway bars help prevent lopsided wheel alignment and work to maintain an overall better grip on the road.  A faulty sway bar puts the vehicle at risk for rolling during turns.  My belief is that there was something faulty about the sway bar mounting bracket or bolt which explains the mild clunking I heard prior to deterioration (more frequent clunking) and ultimate failure (on 8/27/21).  I have a write up of the inspection and repair from the dealer.  I also have photos from the dealer prior to the repair.",
