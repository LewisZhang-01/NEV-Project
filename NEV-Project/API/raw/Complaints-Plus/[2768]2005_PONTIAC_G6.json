I DID TAKE VEHICLE TO A MECHANIC WHO DID REPLACE BRAKES AND ROTORS BUT SAID THEY EASILY WEREN'T THE CAUSE AND WERE NORMAL AND DEFINITELY NOT NEEDED TO BE CHANGED IMMEDIATELY.

AFTER TAKING THE VEHICLE TO AN INDEPENDENT LOCALLY OWNED SHOP, IT WAS LEARNED THAT PONTIAC WAS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE, AND HAD ISSUED A SPECIAL COVERAGE FOR THE PROBLEM. AFTER TAKING IT TO A PONTIAC CERTIFIED DEALERSHIP, THEY REPAIRED THE PROBLEM, AT MY COST OF $780.00, DUE TO THE FACT THAT MY MILEAGE WAS OUTSIDE OF THE SPECIAL COVERAGE PERIMETERS. I WAS ISSED A LETTER OUTLINING THE PROBLEM,AND SPECIAL COVERAGE PERIMETERS IN JUNE 2012, AT WHICH TIME I WAS WELL WITHIN THE MILEAGE AND YEAR PERIMTERS LISTED, BUT WAS NOT EXPERIENCING THE PROBLEM. I DID NOT SEEK REPAIR ASSISTANCE, AS IT INDICATED FOR OWNERS WHO WERE EXPERIENCING THE PROBLEM ONLY TO SEEK REPAIR ASSISTANCE, AND IT WOULD BE COVERED AT NO CHARGE.

THEN ON SUNDAY 8-26-12 MY DAUGHTER DROVE UP AND THE SMELL OF GAS WAS OVERWHELMING. I  LOOKED UNDER THE CAR AND SAW GAS RUNNING THROUGH THE VENTS IN THE METAL SHIELD COVERING THE GAS TANK. THE CAR WAS PARKED UNTIL IT COULD BE INSPECTED BY A MECHANIC. I DID A ONLINE SEARCH FOR A GAS LEAK FOR THE 2005 G6 AND COULD ONLY FIND REFERENCE TO THIS SAME PROBLEM ON THE 2007 AND LATER MODELS. I CALLED TWO  GM DEALERS AND THEY SHOWED NO RECALLS ON THE 2005 MODEL FOR GAS LEAKS AND COULD NOT GIVE ME AN ESTIMATE FOR TOTAL REPAIRS UNLESS I AGREED TO SPEND APPROX. $300 DOLLARS FOR AN INSPECTION. I CALLED MY MECHANIC AND THEY REMOVED THE EXHAUST SYSTEM AND GAS TANK FROM OUR 2005 G6. I MADE A VIDEO OF THE GAS SETTING AROUND THE FUEL PUMP AND ON TOP OF THE GAS TANK. THEY CLEANED UP THE TANK, THEN DID A PRESSURE TEST WHICH SHOWED A CRACK IN THE ELBOW WHICH IS MADE ONTO THE FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY. THE OLD FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY IS STILL A WORKING PART EXCEPT FOR THE CRACK WHICH I BELIEVE IS DEFECTIVE WORKMANSHIP.    I MADE A VIDEO OF THE NEW FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY AFTER ITS INSTALLATION AND I SEE NO DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THE PART IS MADE. I ALSO HAVE THE OLD WORKING PART WITH A VIDEO OF WHERE THE CRACKED ELBOW IS LOCATED.    ON 8-27-12 I SPENT $505.06 FOR THE FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY, $44.82 IN SALES TAX AND $225 IN LABOR.  I AM CONCERNED THAT THE NEW PART WILL DO EXACTLY WHAT THE OLD PART DID AND I WILL BE STUCK WITH A LEAK AGAIN.    I FIND NO COMFORT IN KNOWING MY DAUGHTER COULD BE RIDING AROUND IN A CAR THAT COULD LITERALLY BE A BOMB. IF SOMEONE CHECKED THE FACTS, I THINK THIS PARTICULAR FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY HAS BEEN USED  FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND  HAS ALWAYS HAD PROBLEMS BUT WERE OUT OF THE WARRANTY PERIOD. HOW CONVENIENT!

GM NEEDS TO ISSUE A RECALL FOR ALL CARS AFFECTED BY THIS AND ISSUE REFUNDS TO ANYONE WHO HAS ALREADY HAD TO COME OUT OF POCKET TO FIX IT.

THE STEERING BECAME OVERBEARING TO THE POINT WHERE I COULD NOT TURN AND WAS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC. I TURNED MY CAR OFF AND WAITED ABOUT 5 MINUTES AND RESTARTED IT . AT THAT POINT I WAS ABLE TO MOVE MY VEHICLE AND BEING DRIVING AGAIN. AFTER BEING EXTREMELY FRIGHTENED I MADE HOME AND BEGAN TO DO RESEARCH ON THIS ISSUE. I FOUND NUMBERS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM ALONG WITH YOUR WEBSITE. I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT GM HAS NOT FILED A RECALL ON AN ISSUE THAT IS SO DANGEROUS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY WERE GOING THROUGH BANKRUPTCY BUT AT WHOSE EXPENSE? I HAVE NOT GOTTEN MY VEHICLE FIXED YET DUE TO MONEY ISSUES. HOWEVER I DID NOT EXPECT TO HAVE TO GET SOMETHING SO MAJOR FIXED ON A VEHICLE THAT IS ONLY 4 YEARS OLD. I WAS NOT OFFERED A WARRANTY ON MY VEHICLE WHEN I PURCHASED AND NOW I THINK I KNOW WHY I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS FROM THIS VEHICLE FROM DAY ONE.. ELECTRICITY, BATTERY, BRAKES JUST TO NAME A FEW. CURRENTLY TOYOTA IS UNDERGOING MAJOR ISSUES AND GM NEEDS HAVE A BIT OF THAT LIME LIGHT AS WELL. I FEEL FOR ANY ONE WHO IS EXPERIENCING THIS ISSUE WITH THEIR VEHICLE AS IT IS DANGEROUS AND SCARY PERSONALLY LEAVING ME HELPLESS. I PRAY FOR ANY ONE WHO HAS NOT GOTTEN THIS PROBLEM FIXED AS I WISH THERE IS NOT ANY MORE ACCIDENTS PERTAINING TO A SIMPLE FIX BY GM. IS IT CHEAPER TO HAVE LAW SUITS AGAINST YOU OR FIX THE 100,000 VEHICLES THAT ARE UNDER THIS INVESTIGATION. *TR",

IT WAS LUBED AND REPOSITIONED.  THERE WAS ALSO NOISE FROM STEERING GEAR.  THE GEAR WAS REPLACED AND SET TOE IN.  AS OF THIS LAST FRIDAY, JUNE 12TH, I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM OUT OF TOWN AND THE \"POWER STEERING\" MESSAGE SHOWED UP ON MY CONSOLE.

IT ONLY CLUNKED WHEN THE CAR WAS NOT MOVING AND WHEN YOU TURNED THE STEERING RIGHT AND LEFT. WHEN MOVING IT DIDN'T DO IT.    HOWEVER BEFORE THE CLUNK SOUND STARTED AGAIN, ABOUT TWO MONTHS BEFORE TO BE EXACT (AT 56K MILES), THE CAR WAS STEERING ODDLY ON THE ROAD.

WE ARE HAVING  A POPPING NOISE IN THE STEERING IN THE FRONT END.  THE DEALER TELLS US THIS IS POSSIBLY THE STEERING SHAFT ASSEMBLY.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS THAT THIS CAR IS SO UNRELIABLE AND IT SEEMS THE SAME PROBLEMS ARE CONTINUING WITH GM CARS EVEN IN 2008 MODELS.  I THINK THAT GM SHOULD BE OFFERING TO PURCHASE OUR VEHICLES BACK THE SAME AS I HAVE RECENTLY HEARD A FRIEND SAY THAT TOYOTA DID FOR THEM AT A PERCENTAGE OVER THE CURRENT VALUE OF THE VEHICLE.  DIFFERENT FROM GM THEY HAVE TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR PROBLEMS.  IT SEEMS THAT GM IS DENYING THE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR VEHICLES.  I HAVE ALREADY RESEARCHED THE LEMON LAWS.  MAYBE MORE OWNERS SHOULD DO THE SAME.   GM SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE DIES WITH THE MAJOR STEERING PROBLEMS THEY HAVE.  ALSO ANOTHER PROBLEM WE HAVE HAD IS THAT THE INFORMATION CENTER DISPLAYS ARE EFFECTED BY THE OUTDOOR TEMPERATURE.  *TR",

CONSEQUENCE OF DESIGN FAILURE CAUSED THE ENTIRE ENGINE CRADLE TO SHIFT AND THERE BY ALLOWING FOR AN INCREASE IN DAMAGE POSSIBILITIES TO ENGINE BLOCK AND RADIATOR TO OCCUR. ALSO WITH I-BEAM STRUCTURE BEING BENT DOWNWARD IT HAS CREATED A HANGING PIECE OF METAL TO POSSIBLY CATCH ROAD DEBRIS (COULD LEAD TO TIRE FAILURE) AND ALLOW SLOPE CHANGES IN THE ROAD TO ONCE AGAIN CATCH THE BENT METAL TO CREATE EVEN MORE DAMAGE.     3) THE DEALERSHIP SUGGESTED REPLACING TO THE WHOLE ENGINE CRADLE. I SUGGEST THAT GM SHOULD ATTACH A METAL BAR HORIZONTALLY TO THE TWO FRONT METAL IMPINGEMENTS TO EFFECTIVELY CREATE A GRIND BAR, GREATLY REDUCING THE POSSIBILITIES OF METAL BENDING CAUSING A ROAD HAZARD AND ENGINE CRADLE REPLACEMENT.",
