AT 45 MPH OR LESS, STEERING IS NORMAL, AT 55 MPH IT IS BAD, AT 65 MPH, IT'S LIKE DRIVING ON ICE, SUPER SCARY. AT 70, IT'S OUTRIGHT TERRIFYING. I HAVE DRIVEN LARGE MOTORHOMES FOR MORE THAN 11 YEARS AND NEVER WAS SO SCARED ON THE INTERSTATES. I WEIGHED THE VEHICLE AT A CAT SCALE WITH NO PERSONAL STUFF ONBOARD AND ONLY 1/2 TANK OF GASOLINE. THE TOTAL GROSS WEIGHT WAS 13,600 LBS, WITH 4540 LBS ON THE FRONT AXLE AND 9060 ON THE DRIVE AXLE. ON THAT BASIS, AT REST, 1/3 OF THE WEIGHT IS ON THE FRONT AXLE AND 2/3 ON THE REAR. UNDERWAY AS SPEED INCREASES, WITH THE AIR FLOW EFFECT AND THE LEVERAGE OF ALL THE HEAVY WEIGHTS 6 TO 8 FEET BEHIND THE REAR AXLE, THE FRONT WHEELS MAKE LESS AND LESS CONTACT WITH THE ROAD SURFACE.    IF YOU DO NOT ACT, SOMEBODY WILL GET KILLED. *TR",
