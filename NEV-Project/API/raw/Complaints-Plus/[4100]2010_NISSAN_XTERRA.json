NOT WANTING THE VEHICLE TO BREAKDOWN ON A BUSY ROAD, I BACKED UP AND PARKED THE VEHICLE. I ATTEMPTED TO RESTART THE VEHICLE, BUT THIS TIME THE STARTER WOULD CRANK, BUT WOULD NOT TURN OVER. AFTER ATTEMPTING TO START IT  A FEW TIMES, I DISCONNECTED THE BATTERIES AND RECONNECTED THE BATTERIES. STILL, THE VEHICLE WOULD CRANK AND NOT TURN OVER.

I WAS QUOTED 1500 FOR A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT SHOULD LAST THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE IS ONLY 5 YEARS OLD.   THIS SOUNDED LIKE A VERY INTENSIVE PROCESS, SO I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO NISSAN. AGAIN, THEY SAID IT WAS THE ECU/ECM.  NISSAN TOLD ME THAT THE CABLES, THE BATTERY AND THE ECU NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.    NISSAN HAS HAD PAST ISSUES WITH 2010 VEHICLES SHORTING OUT AND DESTROYING THE ECU'S. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS NISSAN'S FAULTY ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS OR POORLY CONSTRUCTED ECU'S THAT IS CAUSING THE DAMAGE. FOR SUCH AN EXPENSIVE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT TO BE RENDERED USELESS BY HAVING AN IMPORPER BATTERY CONNECTION SEEMS PROBLEMATIC AND POTENTIALLY UNSAFE. IT IS PROBLEMATIC, DUE TO TEH HISTORY OF NISSAN'S CABLES BECOMING CORRODED DUE TO THEIR BATTERY POSITION.

IT NOW HAS APPRX 8000 MILES AND NEEDS A NEW SET OF TIRES WHICH NISSAN IS REFUSING TO CHANGE. THE GAS GAUGE IS CONSTANTLY NOT WORKING, DOES NOT READ PROPERLY, I FINALLY HAD TO PROVE IT TO THEM THIS PAST WEEK AFTER COMPLAINING NUMEROUS TIME AND HAVING THEM, REPLACE THE GAS SENSOR ONE . THE ENGINE HESITATES AT APPRX 40 MILES AN HOUR, ONE OF THESE DAYS I AM AFRAID I WILL BE HIT FROM BEHIND WHEN I STEP ON THE GAS AND IT DOES NOT GO. I AM DEALING WITH CORPORATE NISSAN BUT THE KEEP PUTTING ME OFF. I FEEL IT HAS BECOME A DANGER. THE DEALER SAYS ITS UP TO NISSAN, NISSAN SAYS ITS NOT THEM SO I AM STUCK WITH BAD TIRES ON MY NEW VEHICLE,  THEY ARE GENERAL TIRES. THEY HAVE INDENTED DIMPLES, SIDE WALLS ARE WEARING OUT AND TREAD IS WEARING UNEVEN.  THE FIRST SET WAS REPLACED AROUND 3000-4000 MILES. THE ENGINE HESITATION AND  THE GAS SENSOR I AM CONSTANTLY GETTING EXCUSES FOR THOSE ISSUES. SO FAR THE TIRES HAVE BEEN REPLACED ONCE AND  NEED TO BE REPLACED AGAIN I WAS TOLD NO, GAS SENSOR NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AGAIN THAT IS TO BE DONE POSSIBLY  IN THE FUTURE. WHAT ABOUT MY ENGINE ISSUE. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A POSSIBLE LEMON? MY TRUCK IS IN THE SHOP SO MUCH THE DEALERSHIP HAS A KEY TO IT. HOW DO I FIND OUT IF THOSE TIRES ARE SAFE TO DRIVE ON THEM? I CAN NOT HAVE MY LIFE AND THE PEOPLE WHO DRIVE WITH ME IN DANGER. I WAS TOLD THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE SENSOR FOR THE GAS GAGE- THAT WAS REPLACED I STILL HAVE ISSUES. OBVIOUS THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY VEHICLE IF THEY REPLACED THE TIRES ONCE AND NOW 4000 MILES LATER THE NEW TIRES ARE BAD AGAIN. THE DEALERSHIP SAID I MIGHT WANT TO ROTATE THE TIRES EVERY 3000 MILES. ALL 4 TIRES HAD TO BE REPLACED AND ALL 4 TIRES ARE GOING BAD AGAIN. *TR",
