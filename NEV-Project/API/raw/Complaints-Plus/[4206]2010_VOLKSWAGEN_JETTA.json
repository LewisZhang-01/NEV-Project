After that incident we have stopped using this vehicle since it gets even more dangerous every time, especially when it rains. Since then brake light has come on and hydraulic and suspension has been bad. This happened last year when pandemic was still full force and without a vehicle. Had to save and buy a more reliable vehicle for our own safety.

I\u2019ve checked there is a recall for this but my \u201cJetta\u201d is not in those vehicles that were recalled. I really cant drive the vehicle therefore i have no use for it.

The manufacturer was notified of the failure. The approximate failure mileage was 55,000.  While the owner does not expect VW to pay for the stabilizer links or carbon manifold repairs, they do expect the ABS module to be covered because it was the same faulty module which was in all the other 2009 and 2010 Jettas which were recalled previously. This specific vehicle was, I believe, limited to 1,000 vehicles as it is a limited edition version of the 2010 VW Jetta. It does, however, have the same ABS module as the 2010 Jettas with the open recall. VW Corporate as well as Platinum VW in Hicksville were informed about the recall for 45F2 which recalled the ABS module on most VW Jettas from 2009 to 2010. We were told that our vehicle, for unknown reasons, was not part of that recall. Mind you, this is DESPITE having the same exact failure of the ABS module and Traction Control as the regular 2010 VW Jettas We got the vehicle repaired and had to pay a very large amount of money to replace and repair the module which should have been covered under the recall. We should not be penalized because we have a more limited edition of a vehicle, please help, thank you!

ON 6/14/19 WE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL DEALER TO HAVE THIS ISSUE CHECKED OUT. THE RECEIPT FROM THAT VISIT SHOWED THAT THE ABS PUMP AND MODULE HAD FAULTS. THE DEALERSHIP RECOMMENDED REPLACING BOTH AT A COST OF $2,610. WE ASKED THE SERVICE PERSON WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE DIDN'T REPLACE THEM AND HE SAID THE BRAKES WOULD STILL WORK BUT THE ABS MIGHT NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY, BUT THAT WE SHOULD BE OK. WE HAVE CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE WITH THE LIGHTS ON MOST OF THE TIME SINCE THEN WITHOUT ANY NOTICEABLE PERFORMANCE CHANGE; HOWEVER, PERFORMANCE IS STARTING TO BECOME AN ISSUE. THE ABS AND ESC LIGHTS HAVE BEEN REMAINING ILLUMINATED FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW. ALSO IN THE LAST MONTH OR TWO THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS NOW STARTING TO COME ON PERIODICALLY WITH A CORRESPONDING ISSUE WITH THE STEERING BEING MORE DIFFICULT. WE ARE BECOMING MORE CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY. AS A RESULT, WE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO AN INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOP THIS WEEK TO GET THE PROBLEM CHECKED OUT. HE INFORMED US THAT THERE IS AN ACTIVE RECALL (16V913000) THAT WOULD CORRECT ALL OF THESE ISSUES. HE GAVE US A COPY OF THE RECALL AND SAID WE WOULD NEED TO TAKE IT TO THE LOCAL DEALER TO HAVE THE REPAIR DONE.

I VERIFIED HER CAR DRIVING CONDITION MYSELF.  I WAS TRAVELING ABOVE 70 MPH ON A 65-MPH FREEWAY ZONE.  SUDDENLY THE CAR STARTED TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY AS IF ALL WHEELS WERE SEVERELY OFF-BALANCED. IGNORING MY ACCELERATOR PEDAL, I COULD BARELY DRIVE ABOVE 45 MPH.  I FELT VERY UNSAFE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND PREPARED TO BE HIT BY ANOTHER CAR AT ANY MOMENT.     TO ACHIEVE A DESIRED QUICK BRAKE PEDAL RESPONSE ON VOLKSWAGEN VEHICLES, THE DESIGN ENGINEERS OPTED TO INCREASE THE ASSEMBLY INTERFERENCE BETWEEN THE BRAKE MASTER CYLINDER AND THE BOOSTER INSTEAD TO REDUCE THE BRAKE PEDAL TO THE MASTER CYLINDER PISTON TRAVEL RATIO.  THEY REDUCED THE CLEARANCES FROM THE MASTER CYLINDER PISTON SEALS TO THE BRAKE FLUID SUPPLY/RETURN PORTS SO THAT THE CAR BRAKES CAN BE ACTIVATED WITH SHORTER BRAKE PEDAL STROKE.  AS THE RESULTS, UNDER ASSEMBLY DIMENSIONAL TOLERANCE STACK-UPS, SOME CARS WERE BUILT WITH THE BRAKE FLUID SUPPLY/RETURN PORTS PARTIALLY OR FULLY COVERED BY THE PISTON SEALS AT THE VOLKSWAGEN FACTORIES.  WHEN THE THERMALLY EXPANDED BRAKE FLUID CANNOT FLOW BACK TO RESERVOIR THROUGH THE FULLY COVERED SUPPLY/RETURN PORTS EASILY, THE FLUID WILL EXPAND BRAKE CALIBER PISTONS PUSHING THE BRAKE PADS AGAINST THE ROTORS RESULTING BRAKE DRAGGING.  WHEN A MOVING CAR'S ENGINE CANNOT OVERCOME WITH THE BRAKE DRAGGING FRICTIONS, THE CAR DRIVER WILL LOSE HIS/HER CONTROL TO THE VEHICLE SPEED. THE O-RING SWELL DUE TO AGING MADE THE JETTA WORSE.

MY MILEAGE WENT OVER THE ALLOTTED AMOUNT  BY 5K MILES BUT AFTER MANY CALLS TO VW CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY REFUSED ANY HELP, THEY WOULD NOT COVER THE $5,000 REPAIR, THE $3,000 IN PARTS OR ANYTHING. THEY REFUSED ANY TYPE OF HELP EVEN THOUGH THEY MOST CERTAINLY COULD HAVE ASSISTED ME. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE FUEL PUMP IS POOR, EVEN THE REPLACEMENT PUMPS HAVE A HUGE FAILURE RATE YET VW DOES NOTHING TO ASSIST THEIR CUSTOMERS. THEY HAVE FAILED TO PRODUCE A HPFP THAT DOES NOT BREAK DOWN AND THEN THEY MAKE IT THE CUSTOMERS FAULT BY NOT RECALLING THE PART. THESE FUEL SYSTEMS SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED AS A RECALL BEFORE THEY CAUSE THE CAR TO SUDDENLY STOP ON A BUSY INTERSTATE.     I AM THANKFUL THAT I WAS NOT INJURED BUT I AM FURIOUS THAT I AM JUST ONE OF MANY THAT HAVE WENT THROUGH THIS AND BEEN OFFERED NO HELP. WE ARE LEFT TO PAY THE PRICE, ONE THAT RUNS ANYWHERE FROM $5,000-$9,000.  THAT IS AN UNACCEPTABLE REPAIR COST TO A VEHICLE WITH UNDER 125K MILES, AND IT HAPPENS AS SOON AS 6K. THE ENGINEERS AT VW SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR POOR DESIGN, INABILITY TO CORRECT IT AND ABANDONMENT OF THEIR LOYAL CUSTOMERS.    VW HAS SHOWN A COMPLETE DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE BY FAILING TO PROPERLY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.",

THE VEHICLE IS NOW PRETTY MUCH A TOTAL LOSS, AND IS VALUED AT $8000 - WHICH A RETIREE SUCH AS MYSELF CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE.    MY AUTO INSURANCE DOES NOT COVER THIS LOSS.    THE COURT CASE IS:  JOHN DEWEY, JACQUELINE DELGUERCIO, ET AL V. VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA, INC. ET AL. CASE NOS. 07-CV-2249-FSH-PS AND 07-CV-2361-FSH-PS (CONSOLIDATED))     THE FINAL DECISION WAS IN 2014, JOHN DEWEY, JACQUELINE DELGUERCIO, ET AL V. VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA, INC. ET AL.

AFTER WAITING 5-10 MINUTES SHE WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE ENGINE AND, WITH NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS APPEARING, DRIVE APPROXIMATELY FOUR MILES HOME. THE FOLLOWING MORNING, UPON STARTING THE ENGINE, MULTIPLE CYLINDER MISFIRES BEGAN OCCURRING AND THE ENGINE WAS IMMEDIATELY SHUTOFF AND THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR DIAGNOSIS.    THE DEALERSHIP DISCOVERED THAT THE STALL WAS DUE TO THE TIMING CHAIN TENSIONER FAILING, WHICH ALLOWED THE TIMING CHAIN TO SKIP SIX TEETH ON THE CAMSHAFT AND THE VALVES TO CONTACT THE PISTONS RESULTING IN THE ENGINE SELF-DESTRUCTING. THEY RECOMMENDED A NEARLY COMPLETE ENGINE REPLACEMENT AT A COST OF OVER $8,000. THE CAR WAS PURCHASED BRAND NEW IN 2009 AND HAS BEEN MAINTAINED IMPECCABLY AS SPECIFIED BY VW.    SPEAKING WITH THE DEALERSHIP ENGINE TECHNICIAN, WE LEARNED THAT THE TIMING CHAIN TENSIONER IS A KNOWN DEFECTIVE PART BY VW AND THAT IN 2011-2012, WAS REVISED SEVERAL TIMES IN AN ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE THE FAILURES.

WHEN PRESSING LOCK BUTTON ON KEY FOB, DRIVER'S DOOR REMAINS UNLOCKED AND DOOR CAN BE PHYSICALLY OPENED USING DOOR HANDLE WITHOUT CAR ALARM GOING OFF.  NEED TO MANUALLY LOCK AND UNLOCK DRIVER'S DOOR BY PUTTING KEY IN THE LOCK AND TURNING CLOCKWISE.  ONCE LOCKED, DRIVER'S DOOR WILL THEN NOT UNLOCK WITH KEY FOB AND NEEDS TO BE MANUALLY UNLOCKED BY PUTTING KEY IN THE LOCK AND TURNING COUNTER-CLOCKWISE.  [NOTE THAT THIS PROBLEM STILL EXISTS AND HAS NOT BEEN FIXED AS OF MAY 2016.]  ONE YEAR LATER, ABOUT AUGUST 2015 (MILEAGE ~ 94,000): NOW THERE IS ALSO AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM WTH THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE DOOR LOCK - SOMETIMES WHEN UNLOCKED WITH THE KEY FOB, THE DOOR WILL NOT UNLOCK AND THE DOOR WILL NOT OPEN USING THE OUTSIDE DOOR HANDLE.  THE DOOR WOULD ALSO NOT OPEN WHEN TRIED WITH THE KEY IN THE LOCK OR WHEN USING THE INSIDE DOOR HANDLE OR WHEN THE LOCK/UNLOCK BUTTON INSIDE THE CAR IS PRESSED.  THIS REAR PASSENGER DOOR PROBLEM HAS HAPPENED AT LEAST 3 TIMES AND THIS DOOR IS USED INFREQUENTLY, SO IT COULD BE HAPPENING MORE OFTEN.  THESE DOOR LOCK ISSUES ARE A POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE IF A PERSON GETS LOCKED IN AND CANNOT GET OUT OF THE DOOR IN AN EMERGENCY.",

I STARTED IT BACK UP AND AFTER MAYBE 10 SECONDS IT STALLED AGAIN AND WOULDN'T START BACK UP. I TOWED THE CAR TO A VW SPECIALIST SHOP AND THEY DIAGNOSED THE ISSUE AS A FAILED HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP AND REQUIRING REPLACEMENT OF THE ENTIRE FUEL SYSTEM. I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A VW DEALERSHIP AND THEY'RE DIAGNOSTIC WAS THE SAME. THEY SENT OUT A FUEL SAMPLE AND IT FAILED FOR LUBRICITY.  I EXPECTED VW TO COVER THIS SINCE THIS WAS A KNOWN VW ISSUE. THE CAR SAT AT A DEALERSHIP FOR OVER A MONTH BEFORE HAVING TO TOW IT BACK HOME. THE REPAIR WILL COST AROUND $5,600. I WOULD FIX IT MYSELF BUT THE PARTS ALONE CAN BE $3,000 TO $4000. I PURCHASED THIS CAR IN MAY 2015, SO ONLY GOT TO DRIVE IT FOR FIVE MONTHS. I HAVE LOST ALL FAITH IN THE RELIABILITY AS WELL AS THE CONFIDENCE THAT VW WILL FIX ANY ISSUES THAT ARE DUE TO FAULTY PARTS.

AS I CONTINUED TO DRIVE IT WENT OFF AGAIN,  BUT LOUD A RHYTHIMATIC BEAT STARTED THOROUGH OUT EACH OF THE SPEAKERS, SOUNDED LIKE SOMEBODY HITTING A MICROPHONE THAT WAS ON! I ARRIVED AT MY HOUSE SHORTLY AFTER THAT NOISE STARTED (THANKFULLY) AND TURNED OFF MY CAR. REMOVED THE KEYS FROM THE IGNITION BUT THE LOUD NOISE DID NOT STOP!!! I HAD TO OPEN THE HOOD AND PULL OUT SOME FUSES TO GET IT TO STOP!  TWO WEEKS AFTER THIS HAPPENED, MY CAR DIED WHEN WAITING IN A DRIVE-THRU. WE HAD TO PUSH MY CAR. MY CAR WOULD CRANK BUT NOT START. NOTHING INSIDE THE CAR WOULD WORK. I CALLED MY HUSBAND, HE OPENED THE HOOD, UNHOOKED A FUSE AND IT STARTED! THE NEXT DAY MY CAR WAS DEAD, HAD TO PUT IT ON A BATTERY CHARGER.  I'M AFRAID IF I REPLACE  THE STEREO, IT TOO WILL GO OUT AND POSSIBLY SHORT OUT OTHER ELECTRICAL ITEMS IN MY CAR. AS OF NOW, THE STEREO IS IN PLACE BUT UNHOOKED AND MY BATTERY IS FINE.

GOT TO EL PASO ON 3/1/15 & GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT TRAVELING AT A VERY SLOW SPEED (15MPH OR LESS) GOING DOWNHILL. MY PARTICULAR ISSUE COMES IN THE WAY OF HOW THE TRANSMISSION BEHAVES GOING DOWNHILL AT HIGH OR SLOW SPEEDS. WHEN THE CARS ECU (ELECTRONIC CONTROL UNIT) SENSES THE CAR GOING DOWNHILL, AND YOU TRANSITION FROM THE THROTTLE PEDAL TO THE BRAKE PEDAL, THE CAR BEHAVES AS IF YOU WERE DRIVING A MANUAL TRANSMISSION DOWNSHIFTING & STAYING IN GEAR. NOW YOU MAY THINK THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM, BUT....SINCE THESE TRANSMISSIONS TECHNICALLY ARE MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS WITH AN AUTOMATIC CLUTCH...IF YOU WERE DRIVING A MANUAL TRANSMISSION CAR & WANTED TO STOP QUICKLY AS I DID TO AVOID HITTING ANOTHER CAR, YOU WOULD PUSH THE CLUTCH IN TO DISENGAGE THE TRANSMISSION FROM THE ENGINE...& THUS CAUSE THE CAR TO LOSE IT'S LOCOMOTIVE FORCE. WELL, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS CAR DID DURING THE ACCIDENT. THE AUTOMATIC CLUTCH DID NOT DISENGAGE FROM THE ENGINE WHEN SLOWING DOWN TO A STOP, AND, THUS PROVIDED THE MASSIVE LOW END TORQUE THE DIESEL ENGINE PROVIDES EVEN AT VERY LOW ENGINE SPEEDS. SO, THAT WHEN I SAW THE CAR STOPPED IN FRONT OF ME, I RESPONDED WITH HITTING THE BRAKES, TURNING THE IGNITION OFF, AND EVEN SWERVED TO THE LEFT IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID HITTING THE BACK OF THE OTHER VEHICLE. I COULD NOT STOP THE VEHICLE IN TIME TO AVOID HITTING THE OTHER CAR. MY BACKGROUND: I'M A 32 YR PRO-AUTOMOTIVE TECH WHO NOT ONLY WORKS ON, DIAGNOSES & REPAIRS ALL SORTS OF VEHICLES USING COMPUTER CONTROLS...BUT, I USED TO TEACH IT AS WELL. SO, AFTER DRIVING THIS CAR NOW FOR SEVERAL WEEKS, &...HAVING RESEARCHED THIS CAR & MULTIPLE OTHER DSG OWNERS COMPLAINTS ONLINE ABOUT THE WAY THESE TRANSMISSIONS SHIFT...I CAN SAY FOR SURE, VW'S THAT USE THESE DSG TRANSMISSIONS IS/ARE A MAJOR ISSUE WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC SAFETY.  *TR",

THERE WAS NO WARNING, NO GRADUAL FAILURE, NO TIME TO GET OUT OF THE STREET.  PLEASE NOTE, I HAD  MY VEHICLE REGULARLY SERVICED AT THE VW DEALERSHIP, INCLUDING INSTALLING THE FUEL INTAKE COUPLING THAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF A RECALL ABOUT A YEAR AGO. THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THERE WAS SOME BAD DIESEL GOING AROUND IN THE COUNTY WHERE I LIVE, BUT WHEN PRESSED ADMITTED THE BAD FUEL HAD NOT BEEN TRACED TO ANY PARTICULAR BRAND, BUT HAD APPEARED RANDOMLY. HE DID SAY THAT MY ENTIRE FUEL SYSTEM WOULD BE REPLACED ON VW'S DIME, EVEN THOUGH I AM LONG OUT OF WARRANTY, AND THAT IT COULD TAKE 2 DAYS TO A WEEK TO PERFORM THE SERVICE.  THERE IS NOTHING ON VW'S WEBSITE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, NOR ARE THERE REPORTS OF BAD DIESEL FUEL IN THE COUNTY.  THE BLOGOSPHERE HAS REPORTS OF PROBLEMS IN THE DESIGN OF THE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP THAT CAUSES IT TO BREAK DOWN AND SHED BITS OF METAL THROUGHOUT THE FUEL SYSTEM.  I AM VERY LUCKY THAT THIS HAPPENED AT 20 MPH ON A TOWN STREET IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MORNING AND NOT AT 65 MPH ON A HIGHWAY WITH LOTS OF TRAFFIC. I AM GLAD VW IS COVERING THE COST OF REPAIRS.

I AM NOW WORRIED THAT SOMEONE MIGHT GET DEAD BECAUSE OF THIS, ESPECIALLY SINCE VW IS EVIDENTLY ONLY CORRECTING THIS DESIGN PROBLEM AFTER AN ENTIRE SYSTEM FAILURE.

I CURRENTLY HAVE ONE OF THESE ISSUES WITH METAL FLAKES APPEARING ON THE FILTERING SCREEN FOR THE HPFP LOCATED UNDER THE PRESSURE TRANSDUCER.  OBVIOUSLY, THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN BUILDING FOR SOME TIME IN ORDER FOR THIS AMOUNT OF METAL FLAKES TO ACCUMULATE (VEHICLE WOULD BARELY RUN--IDLED TO DEALER).  THIS IS NOT AFFECTING JUST VW'S.  I SEE THE SAME ISSUE IN DODGE, GM, FORD, AUDI, AND MANY OTHER MODELS.  THE PROBLEM LIES WITH THE ULTRA-LOW SULFUR FUEL.  SULFUR IS A LUBRICATING MOLECULE UNDER HIGH PRESSURE APPLICATIONS.  PROBLEMS BEGAN CROPPING UP AFTER SWITCH TO ULTRA-LOW SULFUR FUEL.  THE OLDER LOW-SULFUR FUEL WOULD STILL LUBRICATE.  THE FIX IS TO EITHER HARDEN THE PUMP FACES TO A MUCH HIGHER DEGREE SUCH THAT NO LUBRICATION IS REQUIRED.  OR, ADD A 5% MIX OF BIODIESEL TO THE PETRODIESEL TO RESTORE LUBRICITY TO FUEL.  SOME ADDITIVES ALSO ACCOMPLISH THIS SAME LUBRICATING EFFECT.  I HAVE NOW HANDLED AROUND 40 CASES OF DIFFERING MAKES WHERE THIS SAME ISSUE CROPS UP.  HOWEVER, I ONLY SEE THE CASES WHERE AN INSURANCE CLAIM IS FILED WITH AN INSURANCE CARRIER.  IN ALL CASES, I GO BACK TO THE STATION WHERE THE CUSTOMER FUELS THE VEHICLE TO OBTAIN SAMPLE.

OUR VEHICLE JUST EXPIRED ITS NORMAL WARRANTY (67,000 MILES) AND THE 2010 ONLY CAME WITH 60,000 MILE WARRANTY VS. THE CURRENT 100,000 MILE WARRANTY.  THIS ISSUE APPEARS TO BE ENTIRELY A DESIGN FLAW AND A KNOWN ISSUE.  WE LOVE THE CAR, AND IT HAS BEEN THE BEST CAR WE HAVE EVERY OWNED UP UNTIL THIS POINT.  I HOPE THAT VOLKSWAGEN ASSUMES RESPONSIBILITY AND KEEPS A LIFETIME CUSTOMER.  *TR",

THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN TO CVM DEALERSHIP, MECHANICSBURG, PA (CAR WAS PURCHASED AT THIS LOCATION DEC 2009) FOR SERVICES.  ALL SERVICE WORK HAS BEEN COMPLETED ON AS RECOMMENDED BY VOLKSWAGEN.  THIS ISSUE WAS REPORTED AND NOTED ON MY SERVICES RECORDS ON SEVERAL DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, WITH NO KNOWN CAUSE AND REMEDY.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD MANY TIMES THAT THERE IS NO ?SERVICE CODE? OR ?ERROR? CODE ON THE VEHICLES COMPUTER.  I HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT  THE DEALERSHIP COULD NOT REPLICATE THE ISSUE AS I DESCRIBED IT.  I?M VERY FRUSTRATED AT THIS POINT AS I PURCHASED THIS CAR NEW AND PAID FOR AN EXTENDED WARRANTY TO 50,000 MILES THAT IS FAST APPROACHING.   I WILL BE TAKING THE CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN TO SEE IF THEY CAN GIVE ME ANY INFORMATION.  I FEEL THIS IS SAFETY CONCERN FOR MY FAMILY AND OTHERS DRIVING SIMILAR VEHICLES.  PLEASE HELP.  *TR",

WHEN WE TRIED TO GET MORE INFORMATION FROM A CORPORATE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE LATER IN THE WEEK (AFTER WE LEARNED OF THE INVESTIGATION), HE DENIED ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE FUEL PUMP BUT DID SAY THAT OUR FAILURE APPEARED NOT TO BE CAUSED BY CONTAMINATED DIESEL. HE REFUSED TO COMMENT FURTHER ON THE SITUATION AND WOULD NOT TELL US WHETHER OR NOT THE PUMP HAD BEEN REDESIGNED SINCE OUR VEHICLE WAS MADE.

TWICE RECENTLY, ONCE ON MY WAY TO WORK AND ONCE ON MY WAY BACK, THE CAR STALLED TWO AND THREE TIMES RESPECTIVELY.  IT EVEN STALLED ON THE HIGHWAY GOING 65 MPH WHEN THE CLUTCH WAS DEPRESSED. USUALLY, IT STALLS WHEN COMING TO A RED LIGHT OR STOP SIGN WHEN THE CLUTCH IS DEPRESSED IN ORDER TO TAKE THE CAR OUT OF GEAR.  AT 12000 MILES, THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND OFF A FEW TIMES AND THEN REMAINED ON. THE DIESEL PARTICULATE FILTER AND EGR VALVE WERE REPLACED WHICH IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL FOR A CAR WITH SUCH LOW MILEAGE.

SO I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER AND THAT IS WHEN THEY CHANGED THE #4 EXHAUST GAS TEMPERATURE SENSOR.  IT DID NOT SOUND TO ME LIKE A PROPER FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM AS I BELIEVE IT COULD BE EITHER AN ELECTRONIC GLITCH WITH THE ECM OR OTHER ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS OR SOME FUEL SYSTEM PROBLEM WHEREBY FUEL FLOW IS INTERRUPTED WHEN GOING FROM LOAD TO NO LOAD SCENARIOS, I.E.

THE FUEL TANK CAPACITY OF THIS CAR IS 13 GALLONS AND THE AVERAGE ECONOMY OVER THIS TRIP WAS RECORDED AS 35.7 MPG. WHEN THE CAR WAS SHUT OFF, THE GAUGE READ APPROXIMATELY 1/4 FULL. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE CAR WAS LEAKING SEVERAL GALLONS OF DIESEL PER HOUR.     THE CAR WAS BOUGHT IN MAY 2010 (THIS COMPLAINT IS WRITTEN ON MARCH 6, 2011) NEW WITH 11 MILES ON IT. WAS SERVICED ON OCTOBER 2011 AS PER OWNERS MANUAL. NO DAMAGE OR OTHER ISSUES TO THE CAR. NO SEVERE SERVICE. MAINLY USED TO COMMUTE TO AND FROM WORK AND RUN ERRANDS.   *TR",

WHEN I PURCHASED MY NEW CAR, THE SALESMAN AT VW OF LANGHORNE, PA, WAS CERTAIN THAT I WOULD \"KILL THE CLUTCH\" ON THE FIRST DRIVE AS HAD ALL OTHER PEOPLE WHO PURCHASED A MANUAL 2010 TDI. THE CLUTCH RESPONSE IS SOMEHOW DIFFERENT THAN ANY OTHER CAR AND AFTER ADDING THE \"DIESEL TURBO LAG,\" IT MAKES FOR A DANGEROUS FIRST ACCELERATION. TO MY SALESMAN'S SURPRISE, I DID NOT STALL THE CAR WHEN I DROVE IT OFF THE LOT. HOWEVER, I HAVE SINCE STALLED IT SEVERAL TIMES IN TRAFFIC. WHEN THE CLUTCH STALLS, DRIVER MUST COMPLETELY TURN OFF IGNITION AND TURN IT BACK ON BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO CLUTCH-DRIVE AGAIN. THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE AMONG 2010 MANUAL TDI OWNERS AND ONE FREQUENTLY DISCUSSED BECAUSE IT IS VERY DANGEROUS. SOME OWNERS ON \"TDI CLUB\" LIST SERVER ARE CHANGING OUT THEIR OWN CLUTCHES TO STAY ALIVE. I AM AN EXCELLENT \"STICK\" DRIVER WITH 25 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN MANY VEHICLES. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS CLUTCH ISSUE BEFORE PEOPLE GET KILLED. IT'S NOT MY DRIVING PROBLEM OR MY PARTICULAR CAR'S PROBLEM--IT IS A PROBLEM WITH ALL 2010 MANUAL TDI CLUTCH STARTS. I CANNOT LET ANYONE ELSE DRIVE MY CAR, EVEN MY OWN HUSBAND (WHO DRIVES A 2003 MANUAL TDI GOLF), BECAUSE I AM AFRAID HE WILL GET KILLED PULLING OUT IN TRAFFIC AS CLUTCH STALLS ARE FREQUENT WITH THE 2010 MANUAL TDI JETTA MODEL--EVEN AFTER YOU GET USED TO IT. I PREVIOUSLY OWNED A 2001 MANUAL TDI JETTA AND DROVE IT FOR 10 YEARS WITH NO CLUTCH COMPLAINTS.  I STALL THE 2010 CLUTCH AT LEAST ONCE PER DAY. WHEN MY HUSBAND HAS ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE IT, HE STALLED IT FIVE TIMES IN A ROW THE FIRST DRIVE, AND IN SUBSEQUENT DRIVES STALLS IT EVERY OTHER PULL OUT. THE PROBLEM IS MOST DANGEROUS WHEN LEAVING A DRIVEWAY, PARKING LOT, OR MAKING A LEFT TURN WITH WHAT WOULD NORMALLY BE ENOUGH SPACE IN THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC, BUT WHAT IS NOT ENOUGH WHEN THE CLUTCH STALLS THE CAR. *TR",

I ARRIVED AT MY DESTINATION, OPENED THE HOOD AND HEARD A BUZZING SOUND COMING FROM THE FUEL FILTER AREA.  I TURNED OFF THE CAR AND PICKED UP WHAT I NEEDED FROM MY DESTINATION.  I CAME BACK TO THE CAR STARTED IT AND NOTICED THE NOISE WENT AWAY.  WHEN I ARRIVED HOME THE BUZZING WAS BACK.  I CALLED ED AND NOTIFIED HIM THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE CAR.  HE SAID COME BACK.-I HAD TO GO OUT A FEW HOURS LATER.  I STARTED THE CAR AND NOTICED THAT THE NOISE WAS GONE.  I PROCEEDED TO MY DESTINATION.  WHILE MERGING ONTO THE HIGHWAY THE CAR STALLED ON THE RAMP WHEN I WAS ACCELERATING TO NORMAL HIGHWAY SPEED AND THE CARS BEHIND ME ALMOST COLLIDED INTO THE REAR OF MY CAR.  SINCE I WAS BLOCKING TRAFFIC I FRANTICLY KEPT TRYING TO START THE CAR.  IT FINALLY STARTED AFTER 8 OR 9 ATTEMPTS.  THE CAR PROCEEDED TO RUN INCONSISTENTLY.   IT STALLED AGAIN, AND NOW THAT MY HAZARD FLASHERS WERE ON PEOPLE GAVE ME A LITTLE MORE ROOM.  I EXITED THE HIGHWAY AND PROCEEDED DIRECTLY HOME.  THE ENGINE KEPT SURGING THEN STALLING.  WHEN I GOT TO MY DRIVEWAY IT SEEMED TO IDLE SMOOTH BUT THE BUZZING WAS LOUDER THAN EVER AND I WAS ABLE TO FEEL A VIBRATION IN THE STEERING WHEEL.  WHEN I TURNED OFF THE CAR THE COOLING FANS RAN FOR ABOUT 7 TO 10 MINUTES.-THIS MORNING I HAD TO GO TO WORK.  BECAUSE IT WAS 6AM I HAD TO TRY TO TAKE MY JETTA.  THE CAR STARTED AFTER 2 ATTEMPTS.  I PROCEEDED TO WORK AND THE CAR RAN ROUGH UNTIL IT REACHED OPERATING TEMPERATURE.   WHEN I EXITED THE PARKWAY AND STOPPED AT THE FIRST RED LIGHT I FELT THE VIBRATION IN THE STEERING WHEEL AND HEARD THE BUZZING SOUND.  SINCE YESTERDAY THE BUZZING BECAME LOUDER. *TR",

CURRENT MILEAGE ON VEHICLE IS LESS THAN 1300 MILES.  CAR HAS A AUTOMATIC - DSG TRANSMISSION.  IN MID MAY OF 2010 I BEGAN HAVING SEVERE PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSMISSION LOCKING INTO 3, 4 GEARS WHILE IN DRIVE ESPECIALLY WHEN ENTERING TRAFFIC FROM A START.. THIS CREATES A SEVERE POWER REDUCTION FROM A START AND CAN BE LIFE THREATING,  AND CAUSE INVOLVEMENT IN BROAD SIDE ACCIDENT WHILE ENTERING THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC. TRANSMISSION ALSO JOLTS AND BOLTS WHEN DRIVING, AND WHEN PLACING IN REVERSE OR DRIVE FROM A START. THE CAR HAS SHIFTED IN NEUTRAL ONCE WHILE DRIVING.  I HAVE HAD AT LEAST 15 OCCURRENCES SINCE MAY 12TH.      WHEN THE SITUATION HAPPENS I HAVE TO PULL OFF THE ROAD AND STOP AND WAIT FOR A SAFE CONDITION TO PULL OUT IN THIRD (LOCKED) GEAR.  I CANNOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AT WILL IT JUST OCCURS WITHOUT WARNING.  SOMETIMES THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO RESET TO NORMAL IF YOU TURN OFF THE IGNITION AND WAIT 5-10 MIN BEFORE RESTARTING.    VW/AUDI HAVE HAD NUMEROUS REPORTS OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS DSG TRANSMISSION.  HAD A PROBLEM WITH MY 2008 GTI AND THE METRONICS WHICH VW SENT OUT A SAFETY BULLETING AND REPLACED THE UNIT LAST JULY.  THIS PROBLEM IS FAR WORSE THAN ROUGH SHIFTING IT'S LIFE THREATING.    HAD A REAL SCARY INCIDENT YESTERDAY, LOCKED INTO THIRD AND THEN JUMPED INTO NEUTRAL, HAD TO COAST TO BURM.    CAR IS CURRENTLY TODAY IN THE DEALERSHIP AS I WILL NOT DRIVE IT UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS CORRECTED. THEY WILL INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM AND CHECK FOR ERROR CODES ETC.  I DO NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE DEALERSHIP HAVE BEEN A CUSTOMER SINCE 2000 AND HAVE OWNED 6 VW'S SINCE. THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE DSG TRANSMISSIONS IN VW'S THEY ARE NOT SAFE.    I HAVE ALSO ADVISED VW AT THEIR CUSTOMER CARE SITE AND WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING????    INCIDENT DATE IS THE START OF THE PROBLEM   I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR ASSISTANCE WITH THIS MATTER.

IT STARTED WITH A TEST DRIVE AND A NUMBER OF TIMES AFTER PURCHASE.  I ASSUMED MY MOTOR SKILLS WOULD ADAPT AND THE PROBLEM WOULD BECOME LESS FREQUENT.  HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM PERSISTS, SPECIFICALLY AT INTERSECTIONS WHEN PULLING AWAY FROM A COMPLETE STOP, A ROLLING STOP, OR WHEN BRAKING/CLUTCHING HARD.  IT ALSO HAPPENS WHEN I TRY TO SLOWLY GO OVER BUMPS OR UP HILLS.  THE MOST RECENT INCIDENT RESULTED IN SLIGHT DAMAGE TO MY CAR.  I WAS LEAVING A CONDO GARAGE IN WHICH I HAD TO GO UP A STEEP DRIVEWAY, THROUGH AN AUTOMATIC GARAGE DOOR AND OUT AN ALLEY WITH A SPEED BUMP JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR.  THE COMBINATION OF THE DRIVEWAY, BUMP AND A TIGHT LEFT TURN MEANT THAT I HAD TO GENERATE RPMS INITIALLY, BUT THEN HAD TO TAPER DOWN IMMEDIATELY.  MY FRONT WHEELS MADE IT OVER THE BUMP, BUT MY CAR STALLED AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO AT LEAST COAST MY REAR WHEELS OVER THE BUMP.  ESSENTIALLY I WAS STUCK IN SUCH A SPOT THAT MY CAR CLEARED THE DOOR'S BEAM BUT A PART OF MY TRUNK WAS STILL IN THE PATH OF THE CLOSING DOOR.  IN A PANIC I TRIED TO START THE CAR, BUT ANOTHER NUISANCE GOT IN THE WAY. YOU HAVE TO TURN THE KEY BACKWARD BEFORE TURNING THE IGNITION ON AGAIN.
