(2)IN JULY OF 2004 THE REPLACEMENT IGNITION SWITCH FAILED AFTER APPROXIMATELY 18 MONTHS OF SERVICE.  THE FAILURE OCCURRED WHILE I WAS VISITING ST. AUGUSTINE, FLORIDA.  I NOTICED THAT THE A/C WAS NOT BLOWING COLD AIR.  AS I WAS DRIVING BACK IN TO THE TOWN OF ST. AUGUSTINE I HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE SOMETHING DRAGGING UNDER THE CAR.  I PULLED INTO A PARKING LOT AND THEN FOUND THE CAR WOULD NOT RE-START.  I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE NEAREST AUDI DEALER IN JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA AND THEN RENTED A CAR TO GET BACK HOME TO TAMPA, FLORIDA.  THE BILL FROM THE JACKSONVILLE DEALERSHIP WAS $1758 TO REPLACE THE IGNITION SWITCH AND THE STARTER MOTOR.  I ALSO INCURRED A $150 TOWING FEE AND APPROX $70 RENTAL CAR FEE.  (3)AFTER THE REPAIRS I CONTACTED AUDI OF AMERICA BUT THEY SAID THEY ONLY WARRANTY REPLACED PARTS FOR 12 MONTHS.  SINCE THIS SWITCH LASTED 18 MONTHS IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS.

I HAD BEEN DRIVING FOR OVER AN HOUR WHEN I NOTICED THAT THE CAR WAS ACCELERATING TO NEARLY 70-MPH DOWN HILLS BUT MY FOOT WAS NOT ON THE ACCELERATOR. MY CRUISE CONTROL WAS ON AT THE TIME AND SET TO 55-MPH, SO I TURNED IT OFF BUT THE PROBLEM KEPT OCCURRING. I TRIED BRAKING AS I WENT DOWN HILLS AND THAT SLOWED ME DOWN ENOUGH TO KEEP THE CAR UNDER 55-MPH. I FOUND A REST AREA, SLOWED THE CAR DOWN WITH MY BRAKES AND CAME TO A SAFE STOP (FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE REST AREA). WHEN I CAME TO A STOP, THE ENGINE RPMS WERE AT ABOUT 3500 BUT IT USUALLY IDLES AT 1000. I SHIFTED INTO PARK AND THE RPMS SHOT UP TO 7000 BEFORE I TURNED THE KEY OFF AND THE ENGINE SHUT OFF. I TRIED PUMPING THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WITH THE CAR OFF AND TRIED TURNING THE CAR BACK ON, BUT THE RPMS SHOT UP AGAIN QUICKLY SO, AGAIN, I TURNED OF THE IGNITION (I TRIED THIS 3 TIMES BEFORE GETTING OUT OF THE CAR). THEN I GOT OUT OF THE CAR, WAITED ABOUT 15 MINUTES, GOT BACK IN THE CAR AND TRIED STARTING IT AGAIN. IT STARTED UP FINE AND IDLED AT THE NORMAL 1000 LEVEL.

AUDI OF AMERICA AND AUDI DEALER STATES THAT BUSHING PROBLEM IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE, HOWEVER BASED ON THE NUMEROUS REPORTS ON AUDIWORLD.COM, THIS IS NOT TRUE.  OWNERS REPORT HAVING TO CHANGE CONTROL ARMS EVERY 35K MILES OR SO AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY $1,500 FOR EACH SIDE SINCE THER ARE 4 CONTROL ARMS ON EACH SIDE THAT COST APPROXIMATELY $300 EACH PLUS LABOR.  BASED ON NTSA SEARCH, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS OF THIS SAME PROBLEM; WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO GET A RECALL OF THIS POTENTIALLY SERIOUS PROBLEM?  BRAKE PROBLEM IS ONLY WHEN DRIVING IN WET CONDITIONS.  BRAKES DO NOT RESPOND NORMALLY - APPARENTLY WATER COMES IN CONTACT WITH ROTORS EASILY.  THIS PROBLEM COULD EASILY LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS IN THE NTSA DATABASE AS WELL.  THE IDLE AIR CONTROL VALVE PROBLEM IS A REOCCURRING ONE WHERE THE ENGINE WILL STALL AT IDLE, OR WILL NOT IDLE AT ALL.  WITH A MANUAL TRANSMISSION, THIS IS ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS AS THE ENGINE SOMETIMES DIES WHEN THE CLUTCH IS DEPRESSED AS YOU PREPARE TO STOP.  OBVIOUSLY THIS RESULTS IN A LOSS OF POWER BRAKING AND STEERING WHICH COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME REGARDING ANY OR ALL OF THESE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS CONDITIONS AFFECTING MY CAR.  OBVIOUSLY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE RECALLS ON ALL THREE ISSUES AND WILL PROVIDE WHATEVER ASSISTANCE I CAN TO ENSURE THAT THIS HAPPENS.  THANKS.*AK",
