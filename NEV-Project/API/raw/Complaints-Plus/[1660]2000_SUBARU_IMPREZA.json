I CONTACTED SUBARU AMERICA(CASE # 440952) BEFORE TAKING THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND INFORMED THEM THAT THIS REPLACEMENT WOULD BE THE 3RD RIGHT REAR WHEEL BEARING IN THE CAR.   WHEN I GOT TO THE DEALER, THEY EXAMINED THE BEARING. THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME SUBARU HAD CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND HAD THEM CHECK THE PART NUMBER OF THE FAILED BEARING.  THE NUMBER MATCHED THE NUMBER SUBARU HAD GIVEN HIM TO CHECK FOR, THE BEARING WAS REPLACED WITH A NEW PART NUMBER FREE A CHARGE.   AFTER THE CAR WAS REPAIRED I CALLED SUBARU AMERICA TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE ORIGINAL PART THAT FAILED TO SEE IF I COULD RE-COUP THE COST OF THE 1ST REPLACEMENT($316.000).   THEY WOULDN'T ADMIT THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM AND SAID THAT THE DEALER CHANGED THE PART BECAUSE I PROBABLY WAS A GOOD CUSTOMER(COME NOW).   IF POSSIBLE PLEASE CHECK TO SEE IF THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THESE CARS, I THINK THE ONLY REASON MY DEFECTIVE PART WAS CHANGED IS BECAUSE I CONTACTED SUBARU AMERICA AND TOLD THEM THAT THE SAME PART FAILING 2 TIMES WAS UNACCEPTIBLE.

WHEN THIS IS REPLACED THIS WILL BE THE THIRD RIGHT WHEEL BEARING.  CAR HISTORY:  AFTER OWNING THE NEW CAR FOR 4 MONTHS THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD DEVELOPED A CRACK. THE DEALER TRIED TO TELL ME THE WINDSHIELD CRACKED BECAUSE OF A STONE. I SHOWED HIM THAT THE CRACK STARTED BY THE RIGHT WINDSHIELD PILLAR.  IT WAS REPAIRED FOR FREE.   I WENT IN FOR ROUTINE BRAKE SERVICE AND ONE OF THE MECHANICS ASKED ME IF THE CAR WAS IN AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE THE FRONT RIGHT BRAKE CALIPER WAS A MITSUBISHI CALIPER AND NOT A SUBARU CALIPER.   WHEN I BROUGHT THIS TO THE SERVICE MANAGERS ATTENTION HE STATED THE JAPANESE MANUFACTURERS SOMETIME CROSS-USE COMPATIBLE PARTS IN DIFFERENT MAKES OF CARS. I AM NOT SURE THIS IS A VAILD EXPLAINATION.  I'M WONDERING IF I BOUGHT A NEW CAR THAT HAD SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE RIGHT SIDE(WINDSHIELD PROBLEM, RIGHT FRONT CALIPER FROM ANOTHER MANUFACTURER AND PROBLEMS WITH THE RIGHT REAR WHEEL BEARING).
