THIS CAUSED THE CAR BEHIND ME TO ALMOST REAREND US BUT THE CARS BEHIND THEM ACTUALLY DID GET INTO A CRASH TRYING TO STOP FROM HITTING THEM. THANKFULLY A POLICE CAR WAS A FEW CARS BACK AND WAS ABLE TO PUT THEIR LIGHTS ON AND PUSH MY CAR OUT OF TRAFFIC BECAUSE WE COULDN'T EVEN GET OUT OF THE CAR WITH CARS WHIZZING PAST US ON BOTH SIDES. THANK GOD OR WE COULD'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN A MULTIPLE CAR CRASH AND ONE OF US COULD HAVE GOTTEN HURT. THIS HAPPENED ON 07/13/18. I PAID ABOUT $600 TO REPLACE THE ALTERNATOR AND FIX SOMETHING IN THE COOLING SYSTEM. NOW IT IS ONLY A MONTH LATER, 08/15/18, AND IT'S DONE IT AGAIN. IT STALLED IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONSTRUCTION ZONE DRIVING 35MPH WHILE TAKING MY CHILD TO SCHOOL CAUSING TRAFFIC TO BACK UP. THE CARS WERE DRIVING THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION CONES/SIGNS TO OUR RIGHT ILLEGALLY OR THEY WERE DRIVING DOWN THE SHARED TURN LANE ON OUR LEFT TO GET AROUND ME. ABOUT 200 CARS DROVE PAST US WITHOUT BOTHERING TO OFFER HELP AND EVEN AFTER CALLING 911 FOR HELP, IT TOOK THEM ALMOST AN HOUR TO SHOW UP AND ONCE AGAIN HAD TO PUSH US OFF THE ROAD TO SAFETY. THIS IS CREATING A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN. I SAW RECALL 09V169000 FOR SIMILAR OR SAME ISSUE FOR MY MODEL/YEAR BUT WHEN I LOOK UP MY VIN IT SAYS I HAVE NO RECALLS. I HAD SPENT ALMOST $1300 ABOUT 3-4 YRS AGO TO FIX THIS VERY SAME \"STALLING WHILE DRIVING\" ISSUE AND THOUGHT I WAS PAST ALL THIS. NOW I'M BACK TO SQUARE 1 AND ISSUE STILL EXISTS! WHY IS THIS  NISSAN MURANO FLAW NOT COVERED FOR ALL MURANO'S WITH THIS PROBLEM? PEASE RESEARCH MY VIN# AND SEE IF IT CAN BE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL BEFORE ONE OF US GETS SERIOUSLY HURT?",

I CONTRACTED AAMCO TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION, ONE MONTH LATER, NISSAN USA HAD TO PROVIDE ANOTHER TRANSMISSION TO REPLACE THE ONE CHANGED ONE MONTH BEFORE. LAST MONDAY, JULY 06, 2015, WHILE DRIVING ON THE NEW JERSEY GARDEN STATE PARKWAY, THE VEHICLE PRESENTED SERIOUS TROUBLE, WHEN THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, AWD AND ABS WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON, AS THE VEHICLE LOST SPEED, TRANSMISSION DISENGAGED, PUTTING MY WIFE, MYSELF AND OTHER VEHICLES AROUND US IN SERIOUS RISK OF ACCIDENT. I MANAGED TO PULL THE VEHICLE TO THE SHOULDER AND LATER TO A NEAR BY FRIEND`S HOUSE IN THE GALLOWAY AREA. AFTER CONTACTING NISSAN USA REGARDING THE TRANSMISSION, THEY TOLD ME TO CONTACT AAMCO, SINCE THEY INSTALLED THE NEW TRANSMISSION. AAMCO CHECKED THE VEHICLE AND FOUND OUT THAT, THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY THE ALTERNATOR THAT HEATED UP, DROPPED VOLTAGE TO 12V DC AND CAUSED THE SAFE MODE TO ENGAGE, BY MAKING THE VEHICLE UNSAFE ON THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY. NISSAN USA CLAIMS THAT THIS NHTSA CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN CLOSED, WHEN IT IS TO MY BELIEVE THAT, IT SHOULD BE RE-OPENED AND NOT ONLY ME, BUT ALSO MANY OTHER NISSAN MURANO OWNERS, THAT STILL CONFRONT SUCH FACTORY DEFECTIVE ISSUES TO HAVE THIS ISSUE RESOLVED.

THEY TOLD ME EVERYTHING WAS READING FINE BUT IN MY OPINION THAT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS FEEDING OFF THE JUICE OF A NEW BATTERY. ABOUT 2 HOURS AFTER LEAVING THE DEALER THE SAME THING HAPPEN AGAIN WITH A NEW BATTERY WHILE I WAS DRIVING. THE ABS LIGHT CAME ON THE CAR SLOWED DOWN THIS TIME THE METERS WENT CRAZY THEN IT CUT OFF.

I CALLED NISSAN CORP THAT NIGHT AND VOICED MY CONCERN AND I WAS GIVEN A CASE NUMBER, BUT WAS TOLD I HAD TO GO TO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP. I MADE THE FOR THE NEXT DAY.  TOOK THE CAR IN TO LOKEY NISSAN ON 7/01/04.  THEY VERIFIED I NEEDED A LOWER SEAT ASSEMBLY AND A FINISHER ASSEMBLY (WHICH HOLDS THE WIRES).  THE PARTS ARE $1300. AND LABOR $395.89.

I WAS ABLE TO FIND A USED PART AND MY MECHANIC COULD INSTALL IT, BUT AFTER READING ON THE INTERNET HOW MANY MORENO OWNER'S THIS HAPPEN'S TO, I AM APPALLED.

I WOULD HAVE FILED A COMPLAINT BEFORE NOW BUT WAS NOT AWARE OF YOUR WEBSITE, WHICH I BELIEVE NISSAN DEALERSHIPS SHOULD HAVE FILED WITH NISSAN, AND MAY HAVE BUT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE ABOUT THIS SAFETY HAZARD.

I NOTICED A PROBLEM WITH HYDROPLANING SOON AFTER PURCHASE, AND HAVE ALWAYS BEEN EXTREMELY CAREFUL AND ON GUARD WHEN DRIVING IN RAIN OR EVEN WHEN STREETS ARE WET.  THIS WOULD HAPPEN WITH BRAND NEW TIRES AND TIRES THAT WERE SLIGHTLY WORN SO THE TIRES DON'T SEEM TO BE THE PROBLEM, UNLESS ITS THE TYPE OF TIRE BUT ITS NOT THE TREAD ON THE TIRE.  THE CAR CAME WITH GOODYEAR EAGLE P235/65 R18 TIRES AND I HAVE REPLACED WITH SAME TIRES WHEN NISSAN SERVICE DEPARTMENT ADVISED OF TREAD WEAR.  ON JULY 22, 2013 I WAS ON MY WAY HOME FROM GATLINBURG WITH DAUGHTER AND 2 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER IN CAR.  WE WERE CAUGHT IN DOWNPOUR GOING THROUGH KNOXVILLE.  I TRULY CANNOT BELIEVE WE ARE ALIVE.  MY CAR WOULD CONTINUALLY LOSE TRACTION AND IT WOULD SLIDE TO ONE SIDE UNTIL IT WOULD GRAB TRACTION BEFORE GOING OFF THE ROAD OR WRECKING.  SOMETHING IS TERRIBLY WRONG WITH THE MURANO IN REGARDS TO HYDROPLANING.  I ALSO HAVE HAD THE PROBLEM WITH THE DRIVER'S SIDE VISOR COMING DOWN AND WILL NOT STAY UP SINCE A COUPLE YEARS AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR.  I LOVE EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT MY MURANO AND DUE TO HYDROPLANING SAFETY ISSUE I WILL NOT BE PURCHASING ANOTHER ONE.  PLEASE TAKE THIS ISSUE UP WITH NISSAN BEFORE PEOPLE ARE KILLED.  I CANNOT AFFORD TO REPLACE MY MURANO AT THIS TIME SO IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE PLEASE, PLEASE HELP ME TAKE CARE OF THIS ISSUE. THIS IS DEFINITELY A MANUFACTURER PROBLEM.  THERE IS NO DOUBT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM BUT WAS NOT PROVEN BECAUSE DIDN'T LIVE TO TELL WHAT HAPPENED.  WHAT CAN I DO AT THIS POINT TO PREVENT BECOMING A STATISTIC AND MORE IMPORTANTLY ENSURE THE SAFETY OF MY PRECIOUS CARGO? I FEEL LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.  *TR",

WRONG ANSWER I AM NOT OVER WEIGHT TO CAUSE THAT AND THEN I WAS TOLD THAT I HAD TO BUY THE WHOLE NEW SEAT AND A TRACK THAT COST IS 800 FOR THE PART AND AT THAT  POINT I TOLD THEM ALL I NEED IS A PLASTIC WHEEL...COMPANY TOLD ME IF I HAD AN EXTENDED WARRANTY IT WOULD BE FIX.  WELL I DON'T HAVE ONE AND TRULY DON'T FEEL LIKE I WOULD OF NEED ONE FOR THE AGE AND MILEAGE OF THIS VEHICLE/  IT APPEARS THAT THERE HAS BEEN ALOT OF TROUBLES WITH THE 2005 MODEL AND THEY KNEW IT AND FELT THAT IF PEOPLE HAVE A WARRANTY TO FIX THINGS THEY WILL BE FIXED AND THERE IS NO PAPER TRAIL OF THERE POOR MANUFACTURING OF THE VEHICLE.  AS OF TODAY THERE NOW TELLING ME THAT MY OIL PAN AND THE ALOT OF THE PARTS OF THE UNDERCARRIAGE OF THE VEHICLE IS ROTTED AND NEED TO BE REPLACED.  I HAVE NEVER HAD A ROTTED OIL PAN, NOR HAS ANY OF MY UNDERCARRIAGE OF THE VEHICLE ROTTED, IT APPEARS THAT THERE PARTS ARE NOT HAVING A PROTECTION COAT OF RUSTOLUM ON THEM AND YET ONCE AGAIN THERE ANSWER IS IF I HAVE A WARRANTY IT WOULD BE COVERED.   *TR",

NISSAN NEEDS TO ISSUE A RECALL AND FIX THE PROBLEM AT NO COST TO THE CONSUMER.  WHEN I ASKED A NISSAN DEALERSHIP ABOUT IT, I WAS TOLD IT WAS DUE TO THE WEARING OUT OF THE MECHANISM AND A NEW VISOR WOULD BE ~$300 (INCLUDING A $30 LABOR CHARGE, WHICH IS RIDICULOUS CONSIDERING I'VE TAKEN APART THE VISOR MYSELF AND PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AND I AM IN NO WAY MECHANICALLY INCLINED).  VELCRO DOES NOT FIX THE PROBLEM AS THE LINING OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CAR IS CLOTH ~ THE VELCRO DOES NOT STICK SUFFICIENTLY.  TRYING TO KEEP THE VISOR IN THE DOWN AND LEFT POSITION (AGAINST THE DRIVER'S WINDOW) BLOCKS THE VIEW OF TRAFFIC, AS DOES KEEPING IT IN THE DOWN AND FORWARD (AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD) POSITION.  I ESSENTIALLY HAVE TO DRIVE WITH MY LEFT HAND CONSTANTLY EITHER ON THE VISOR OR WITHIN REACH OF IT IN CASE IT STARTS TO DROP, LEAVING ME WITH ONE HAND TO DRIVE AND REACT.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE THAT NISSAN IS FULLY AWARE OF AND REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE, WHICH SEVERELY IMPACTS MY FAITH IN THEIR PRODUCTS.

THEY FOUND A NUMBER OF OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR AT THE NISSAN SHOP WHICH THEY SAID WERE NOT COVERED - SUCH AS- CAM SHAFT SENSORS,DRIVE BELTS,HEAD GASKET.  I AGREED TO PAY FOR THOSE ITEMS AND TO GET MY TRANSMISSION REPLACED FOR FREE UNDER THE WARRANTY.  THEY SAID IT WOULD TAKE THREE TO FIVE DAYS TO GET THE TRANSMISSION  FROM THE FACTORY.  I GET A CALL TODAY FROM GO NISSAN ON JUNE 19TH ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THEY AGREED TO FIX IT AND THEY NOW SAY THAT THERE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SOME PURPLE FLUID IN THE TRANSMISSION AND NOW THEY WONT REPLACE IT OR COVER IT IN ANY WAY.  THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME BECAUSE IT WAS DELIVERED THERE WITH NO FLUID IN THE TRANSMISSION AT ALL.  THEY SAID, YA, WELL.. WE SAW SOME PURPLE SUBSTANCE IN THE CUP WITH THE PARTS THAT WERE DELIVERED AND WE WILL NOT COVER IT BECAUSE OF THAT CONTAMINATION...  IM AT MY WITTS END HERE, THEY WANT $4000.00 FOR THE TRANSMISSION AND ANOTHER $2,500.00 FOR THE REST OF THE WORK.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

SOME PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE $1600 TO HAVE ALL THE SOLENOIDS REPLACED (AS QUOTED BY DEALERS) WILL FORGO GETTING THEM FIXED, PUTTING THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AT RISK WITH THE ABOVE MISHAP EXAMPLES.

WHEN LOCKING THE DOORS IT'S IMPERATIVE NOBODY CAN GAIN ACCESS AT WILL BY WALKING UP TO THE CAR. IF ANYONE CAN SIMPLY OPEN THE DOOR TO GAIN ACCESS, CARJACKING, INJURY, OR EVEN MURDER IS EASIER. IF THE DOORS LOCKED PROPERLY THIS PROVIDES A MORE SECURE ENVIRONMENT FOR THIS TYPE OF SCENARIO.  2. NISSAN KNOWING THERE IS A SECURITY PROBLEM WITH THEIR LOCKING MECHANISM AND NOT RECALLING THEM FOR SAFETY CONCERN IS NEGLIGENT. IT'S AN OPEN DOOR TO A LAWSUIT IF SOMEONE WERE TO BE MURDERED DUE TO A DOOR THAT DIDN'T LOCK, ALTHOUGH THE DRIVER PUSHED THE LOCK BUTTON AND HEARD THE LOCKING NOISE. REMEMBER, IN THIS CASE THERE'S NO OBVIOUS INDICATION THE DOOR ISN'T LOCKED UNLESS SOMEONE WALKS UP AND OPENS IT FROM THE OUTSIDE. THE DRIVE \"THINKS\" THE DOOR IS LOCKED, WHEN IN REALITY IT'S AN \"OPEN DOOR\" FOR CARJACKING OR ROBBERY.    THIS FAILURE IS AN INTERMITTENT OF OPERATION. SOMETIMES THE DOORS LOCK OK, OTHER TIMES THEY DON'T. IN ADDITION, SOMETIMES THE DOORS UNLOCK OK, OTHER TIMES THEY DON'T.    3. IN EMERGENCIES IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO UNLOCK DOORS QUICKLY. SINCE 99% OF THE TIME WE ALL USE THE BUTTON TO LOCK AND UNLOCK DOORS, USING THE MANUAL LOCKING LEVER IS UNFAMILIAR. AND THE MURANO'S DESIGN IS SUCH THAT IT'S NOT EASY TO COMPREHEND IF IT'S NOT YOUR CAR, FOR INSTANCE A RENTAL CAR. I CAN EASILY UNDERSTAND HOW SOME PEOPLE WOULD BE CONFUSED HOW UNLOCK A DOOR USING THE MANUAL LEVEL IN AN EMERGENCY WHEN THEY VIRTUALLY HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WITH IT. IN EMERGENCIES EVERY SECOND COUNTS. THE LOCKING/UNLOCKING SOLENOID MALFUNCTIONING IS CLEARLY A HIGH RISK IN EMERGENCY SCENARIOS. SOME PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE $1600 TO HAVE ALL THE SOLENOIDS REPLACED (AS QUOTED BY DEALERS) WILL FORGO GETTING THEM FIXED, PUTTING THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AT RISK WITH THE ABOVE MISHAP EXAMPLES.

WHEN LOCKING THE DOORS IT'S IMPERATIVE NOBODY CAN GAIN ACCESS AT WILL BY WALKING UP TO THE CAR. IF ANYONE CAN SIMPLY OPEN THE DOOR TO GAIN ACCESS, CARJACKING, INJURY, OR EVEN MURDER IS EASIER. IF THE DOORS LOCKED PROPERLY THIS PROVIDES A MORE SECURE ENVIRONMENT FOR THIS TYPE OF SCENARIO.  2. NISSAN KNOWING THERE IS A SECURITY PROBLEM WITH THEIR LOCKING MECHANISM AND NOT RECALLING THEM FOR SAFETY CONCERN IS NEGLIGENT. IT'S AN OPEN DOOR TO A LAWSUIT IF SOMEONE WERE TO BE MURDERED DUE TO A DOOR THAT DIDN'T LOCK, ALTHOUGH THE DRIVER PUSHED THE LOCK BUTTON AND HEARD THE LOCKING NOISE. REMEMBER, IN THIS CASE THERE'S NO OBVIOUS INDICATION THE DOOR ISN'T LOCKED UNLESS SOMEONE WALKS UP AND OPENS IT FROM THE OUTSIDE. THE DRIVE \"THINKS\" THE DOOR IS LOCKED, WHEN IN REALITY IT'S AN \"OPEN DOOR\" FOR CARJACKING OR ROBBERY.  THIS FAILURE IS AN INTERMITTENT OF OPERATION. SOMETIMES THE DOORS LOCK OK, OTHER TIMES THEY DON'T. IN ADDITION, SOMETIMES THE DOORS UNLOCK OK, OTHER TIMES THEY DON'T.  3. IN EMERGENCIES IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO UNLOCK DOORS QUICKLY. SINCE 99% OF THE TIME WE ALL USE THE BUTTON TO LOCK AND UNLOCK DOORS, USING THE MANUAL LOCKING LEVER IS UNFAMILIAR.  IN EMERGENCIES EVERY SECOND COUNTS. THE LOCKING/UNLOCKING SOLENOID MALFUNCTIONING IS CLEARLY A HIGH RISK IN EMERGENCY SCENARIOS. SOME PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE $1600 TO HAVE ALL THE SOLENOIDS REPLACED (AS QUOTED BY DEALERS) WILL FORGO GETTING THEM FIXED, PUTTING THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AT RISK WITH THE ABOVE MISHAP EXAMPLES.

I PAID $90.00 FOR TOW SERVICES AND DON'T HAVE A CAR UNTIL WHEN TO GET TO WORK.  THIS IS HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND NOT RIGHT THAT THIS HAPPENS TO US. WE REALLY DEPEND ON THIS CAR FOR MY FAMILY AND TAKE CARE OF THIS FAIRLY NEW CAR.  I USUALLY DON'T COMPLAIN BUT THIS IS ONE IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW BEFORE SOMEONE DIES. NISSAN NEEDS TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY!  *TR",

THE SUN VISORS ARE A DEFECTIVE DESIGN AND KEEP FLIPPING COMPLETELY DOWN AND BLOCKING THE VIEW THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.  IN SOME OF THE MOST INOPPORTUNE TIMES, YOUR VISION GETS COMPLETELY BLOCKED UNTIL YOU FLIP IT BACK UP.  THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS IN THE SNOW, RAIN, HEAVY TRAFFIC, OR AT NIGHT.  SOMETIMES IT CAN DROP 2 - 3 TIMES A MINUTE. THIS IS A PROBLEM ON THOUSANDS OF 2003 TO 2007 MURANOS.  REPLACING THE SUN VISOR IS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE AT $400 EACH AND SINCE THIS FLAW HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED AT ALL BY NISSAN, YOU ARE ONLY REPLACING A DEFECTIVE VISOR WITH A NEW ONE THAT WILL BECOME DEFECTIVE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS.  I REPLACED MY DRIVER'S SIDE VISOR 2 YEARS AGO BECAUSE OF THIS DEFECT AND THE REPLACEMENT ONE IS NOW DROPPING AGAIN.  NISSAN HAS A TSB TO REPLACE THE CLIP THAT HOLDS THE MIRROR SIDE OF THE VISOR BUT THAT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE.  THE PROBLEM IS A DEFECTIVE VISOR, NOT THE CLIP. THE VISOR SHAFT THAT INSERTS INTO THE CLIP LOOSENS INSIDE THE VISOR AND ROTATES, AND THAT IS THE DEFECT.  THE WEIGHT OF THE VISOR EASILY OVERCOMES ANY FRICTION THE SHAFT HAS INSIDE THE VISOR AND DOWN IT COMES.  NISSAN REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS SAFETY DEFECT.  THEY WON'T COVER IT ON THE EXTENDED WARRANTEES.   THERE SHOULD BE A SAFETY RECALL TO ADDRESS THIS SAFETY HAZARD.  IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE EXCEPT THROW $400 TO NISSAN EVERY 2 - 3 YEARS TO REPLACE EACH SINGLE VISOR WITH ANOTHER DEFECTIVE ONE?  THE PASSENGER SIDE IS ALSO NOW DROPPING.  NISSAN HAS RECENTLY RAISED THE PRICE CONSIDERABLY TO GOUGE AND CAPITALIZE ON THEIR POOR DESIGN.  RIGHT NOW I HAVE THE VISOR TIE WRAPPED TO THE SIDE HANDLE AND THAT MAKES THE VISOR COMPLETELY USELESS.  IF I REPLACE BOTH AGAIN, I WILL HAVE SPENT $1200 SO FAR ON VISORS TO ONLY EXPECT TO REPLACE THEM AGAIN IN 2012-2013.   $1200 IS A RIDICULOUS PRICE FOR REPLACING DEFECTIVE VISORS WITH NEW DEFECTIVE ONES.

IN CASE OF ACCIDENT OR EMERGENCY, CANNOT UNLOCK THE FRONT DOOR DRIVER SIDE WITHOUT USING KEY FROM THE INSIDE, WHICH MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE DEPENDING ON CONDITIONS OF EMERGENCY OR ACCIDENT.  ACCORDING TO MANY HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ON INTERNET, DEALERS WANT FROM $500 TO $600 TO REPAIR EVEN TO FIX THE MANUAL LOCKING PROCESS FOR THE DOOR.  THIS AMOUNT IS PROHIBITIVE FORM MANY  PEOPLE FOR WHAT SHOULD BE A SIMPLE FIX OF LESS THAN A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR AT LEAST THE MANUAL LOCKING PROCESS.  THE ELECTRONIC LOCKING SYSTEM IS A LUXURY ITEM, BUT THE MANUAL LOCKING SYSTEM IS BEING HELD HOSTAGE BY THE DEALERS AND IN MY OPINION, PRESENTS A HUGE SAFETY PROBLEM. *TR",

THEN, AT APPROXIMATELY 54K MILES, THE RIGHT REAR PASSENGER DOOR LOCK ALSO BECAME INTERMITTENTLY INOPERATIVE IN THE SAME MANNER.  NOW, AT 59K MILES, ALL DOORS EXCEPT THE DRIVER'S DOOR DO NOT OPERATE WITH EITHER THE INTERIOR DOOR LOCK SWITCH OR THE INTELLIGENT KEY FOB BUTTON.    RECENTLY, THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT, WHERE THEY DIAGNOSED IT AS A PROBLEM WITH THE DOOR LOCK ACTUATOR.  FURTHER, I WAS TOLD THAT THE FRONT RIGHT DOOR LOCK ACTUATOR IS A CONTROL POINT FOR ALL OTHER DOOR LOCKS.      THIS IS OF GREAT CONCERN AS I WAS ASSUMING, AS I'M SURE OTHERS HAVE, THAT I WAS DRIVING IN A SECURE VEHICLE WHEN IN FACT, I WAS UNSECURED FROM FOUR OTHER ENTRY POINTS TO MY VEHICLE.  THIS POSES A THREAT TO MY AND ANY OF MY PASSENGERS' PRESUMED PERSONAL SAFETY FROM WOULD-BE ASSAILANTS GAINING ACCESS TO THE VEHICLE THROUGH LOCKS THOUGHT TO BE SECURE.  THIS COULD ALSO HAVE SERIOUS - EVEN FATAL - RAMIFICATIONS IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT IF THE DOORS OF THE VEHICLE ARE THOUGHT TO BE LOCKED (HAVING NO REASON TO BELIEVE OTHERWISE), BUT WERE NOT.  THIS CREATES THE SERIOUS POTENTIAL OF OCCUPANTS TO BE THROWN FROM A VEHICLE DOOR THAT COULD OPEN DURING AN ACCIDENT DUE TO FAULTY DOOR LOCK ACTUATORS.

DRIVERS SIDE SEAT BEGAN TO WOBBLE (SIDE TO SIDE) AS I WAS COMING TO A STOP.  I WAS CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY AS I THOUGHT THAT THE ENTIRE SEAT HAD COME OFF THE TRACK.  I HAD TO PULL OVER AND TRIED TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  I WAS NOT ABLE TO SEE ANYTHING DUE TO THE PLASTIC COVERS ETC ON THE SIDES OF THE SEAT.  HOWEVER, I  DID NOTICE THAT I COULD COMPLETELY LIFT THE SEAT LEFT TO RIGHT.  I VERY CAUTIOUSLY DROVE HOME.  UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, WE FOUND THAT A METAL PART UNDER THE SEAT IS COMPLETELY BROKEN IN HALF.  THE SEAT IS STILL ON THE TRACK AND ALL OF THE POWER FUNCTIONS ARE STILL OPERATIONAL.  HOWEVER, MY SEAT NOW WOBBLES EVERY TIME I SLOW DOWN, MAKE TURNS OR COME TO A STOP.   THIS IS NOT A WEAR AND TEAR ITEM.   AFTER ONLINE RESEARCH, I HAVE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF REPORTS AND COMPLAINTS WITH THE EXACT SAME ISSUE.  THIS SEEMS TO BE MORE OF A SAFETY HAZARD. I HAVE CONTACTED MY LOCAL NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IT IS NOT A COVERED ITEM UNDER MY EXTENDED WARRANTY AND THAT THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS ISSUE AND IT WILL COST APPROX. $1000 PART AND LABOR TO REPAIR!! HOW MANY MORE COMPLAINTS BEFORE NISSAN VOLUNTARILY RECALLS THIS ITEM OR DO ACTUAL DEATHS HAVE TO OCCUR BEFORE SOMETHING CHANGES? *TR",

HOWEVER, PAST EXPERIENCE LEADS ME TO BELIEVE IT WILL BE TO \"FIX\" THE DOOR, CHARGE ME SOME RIDICULOUS AMOUNT, AND THEN CREATE ANOTHER MALFUNCTION.

MY CAR IS BREAKING DOWN BEFORE MY EYES AND I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY NISSAN WOULD LET THIS HAPPEN TO A LOYAL CUSTOMER.     AS YOU KNOW TAMPERING WITH MY CAR DOOR CAN BE HARMFUL TO MY PERSON IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS:  1.HAVING A SECURE ENVIRONMENT IS PARAMOUNT IN CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS. WHEN LOCKING THE DOORS IT'S IMPERATIVE NOBODY CAN GAIN ACCESS AT WILL BY WALKING UP TO THE CAR. IF ANYONE CAN SIMPLY OPEN THE DOOR TO GAIN ACCESS, CARJACKING, INJURY, OR EVEN MURDER IS EASIER. IF THE DOORS LOCKED PROPERLY THIS PROVIDES A MORE SECURE ENVIRONMENT FOR THIS TYPE OF SCENARIO.   2.THERE IS A SECURITY PROBLEM WITH NISSAN LOCKING MECHANISM AND NOT RECALLING THEM FOR SAFETY CONCERN IS NEGLIGENT. IT'S AN OPEN DOOR TO A LAWSUIT IF SOMEONE WERE TO BE MURDERED DUE TO A DOOR THAT DIDN'T LOCK, ALTHOUGH THE DRIVER PUSHED THE LOCK BUTTON AND HEARD THE LOCKING NOISE. REMEMBER, IN THIS CASE THERE'S NO OBVIOUS INDICATION THE DOOR ISN'T LOCKED UNLESS SOMEONE WALKS UP AND OPENS IT FROM THE OUTSIDE. THE DRIVE \"THINKS\" THE DOOR IS LOCKED, WHEN IN REALITY IT'S AN \"OPEN DOOR\" FOR CARJACKING OR ROBBERY.  3.IN EMERGENCIES IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO UNLOCK DOORS QUICKLY. SINCE 99% OF THE TIME WE ALL USE THE BUTTON TO LOCK AND UNLOCK DOORS, USING THE MANUAL LOCKING LEVER IS UNFAMILIAR. THE LOCKING/UNLOCKING SOLENOID MALFUNCTIONING IS CLEARLY A HIGH RISK IN EMERGENCY SCENARIOS. SOME PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE $1600 TO HAVE ALL THE SOLENOIDS REPLACED (AS QUOTED BY DEALERS). *TR",

I HEARD A SNAP, AND SUDDENLY FELT A DROP IN THE DRIVER SEAT IN MY 2005 MURANO. GIVEN THE DRASTIC DROP, I HAD NO OPTION BUT TO SWERVE INTO THE NEXT LANE, NEARING COLLISION WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE.

THIS MORNING I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH CERRITOS NISSAN, WHERE I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE AND SPOKE TO TOD AND ED, THE SERVICE MANAGERS, IN PERSON. THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY HAD NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF THIS ISSUE, AND THAT IS EXTREMELY RARE AND UNCOMMON. YET, AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ON YOUR WEBSITE AND OTHER VALID SOURCES, I FOUND FREQUENT COMPLAINTS THAT IDENTIFIED THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. ED HAS ADVISED ME TO CONTACT YOU FOR ASSISTANCE AND THAT HE IS WILLING TO HONOR REPLACEMENT OF THE DEFECTIVE PARTS AT NO COST TO ME SHOULD THE NISSAN CORPORATION HANDLE THIS PROBLEM. MY FAMILY HAS PURCHASED OVER 8 NISSAN VEHICLES OVER THE LAST 10-15 YEARS, AND THIS PROBLEM HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

I HAVE TAKEN PICTURE OF THE AREA IN QUESTION, AND CAN SEND IF NEEDED.  WITH THE SEAT NOT PROPERLY ATTACHED TO THE SEAT RAIL AND THE CAR, IT NOW IS A SAFETY ISSUE. IF THIS PART BREAKS WITH NORMAL USE, I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A MODERATE CRASH. HOW MUCH MORE BODILY INJURY IS THEIR WHEN THE SEAT IS NO LONGER ATTACHED TO THE CAR DURING THE COURSE OF A ACCIDENT  VIEWING AUTO WEB SITES, I SEE THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM.

IF THE DOORS LOCKED PROPERLY THIS PROVIDES A MORE SECURE ENVIRONMENT FOR THIS TYPE OF SCENARIO.   2. NISSAN KNOWING THERE IS A SECURITY PROBLEM WITH THEIR LOCKING MECHANISM AND NOT RECALLING THEM FOR SAFETY CONCERN IS NEGLIGENT. IT'S AN OPEN DOOR TO A LAWSUIT IF SOMEONE WERE TO BE MURDERED DUE TO A DOOR THAT DIDN'T LOCK, ALTHOUGH THE DRIVER PUSHED THE LOCK BUTTON AND HEARD THE LOCKING NOISE. REMEMBER, IN THIS CASE THERE'S NO OBVIOUS INDICATION THE DOOR ISN'T LOCKED UNLESS SOMEONE WALKS UP AND OPENS IT FROM THE OUTSIDE. THE DRIVE \"THINKS\" THE DOOR IS LOCKED, WHEN IN REALITY IT'S AN \"OPEN DOOR\" FOR CARJACKING OR ROBBERY.    THIS FAILURE IS AN INTERMITTENT OF OPERATION.

THE LOCKING/UNLOCKING SOLENOID MALFUNCTIONING IS CLEARLY A HIGH RISK IN EMERGENCY SCENARIOS. SOME PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE $1600 TO HAVE ALL THE SOLENOIDS REPLACED (AS QUOTED BY DEALERS) WILL FORGO GETTING THEM FIXED, PUTTING THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AT RISK WITH THE ABOVE MISHAP EXAMPLES.

ANOTHER INTERESTING THING IS THAT WHEN I GOT THE CAR BRAND NEW FROM THE DEALERSHIP, A MONTH BEFORE THE PREVIOUS INCIDENT, ON JULY 23RD, 2005, IT HAD A LEAK IN THE GAS TANK. IT STARTED WITH A SMELL OF GAS AND THE \"SERVICE ENGINE SOON\" INDICATOR LIT AT ALL THE TIMES. THAT HAPPENED WITHIN A DAY OF GETTING THE CAR. THE DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE TANK, THE SMELL WAS GONE, BUT NOT THE PROBLEM WITH THE \"SERVICE ENGINE SOON\" INDICATOR. AFTER A NUMBER OF EMISSION TESTS THEY ALSO REPLACED A VALVE IN THE EXHAUST CONDUCT THAT RUNS FROM THE GAS TANK TO THE CAR EXHAUST. AFTER THAT THE INDICATOR CAME BACK ON, SO THEY REPLACED THE CAR COMPUTER. THIS TIME THE PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED, OR AT LEAST IT HAS NOT HAPPENED AGAIN.

STOPPED AT A REST AREA AND NOTICED GAS LEAKING ON THE PARKING LOT.   I PROCEEDED TO JAMESTOWN, NY (50 MILES) TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE CLOSEST NISSAN DEALER..  SIGNATURE NISSAN  716 664 0175  DISCOVERED  THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE THROUGH THE GAS TANK AND I WOULD NEED TO REPLACE IT.  HE SHOWED ME HOW THE GAS TANK DROPS DOWN AND HAS A SMOOTH UNPROTECTED  SURFACE FACING FORWARD WHERE (WHAT EVER IT WAS THAT HIT THE TANK) WENT THROUGH THE PLASTIC SURFACE. I DELIVERED THE DAMAGED GAS TANK TO COLLINS NISSAN AND IT IS BEING HELD AT THERE SERVICE DEPARTMENT FOR FURTHER INSPECTION...    FOR OVER 50 YEARS OF DRIVING , I HAVE NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN TO ME WHILE DRIVING MANY MAKES OF CARS.  I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY THE TANK HANGS DOWN, HAS A VULNERABLE SURFACE,  AND IS NOT PROTECTED FROM ROAD HAZARDS....THE LEAKING GAS COULD HAVE CAUSED MUCH BIGGER  PROBLEMS.
