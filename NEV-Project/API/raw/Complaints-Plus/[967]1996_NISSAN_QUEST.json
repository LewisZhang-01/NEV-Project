WELL, IT DID FOR ABOUT 4 OR 5 MONTHS, BUT THE CRACKING NOISE IS BACK AND WORSE THAN BEFORE.  I ALSO COMPLAINED ABOUT FRONT SUSPENSION CRACKING NOISES BUT ALSO WAS TOLD NOTHING COULD BE DONE.  SEAT BELTS HAVE BEEN CHANGED BEFORE, BUT ARE ACTING UP AGAIN.  THEY DON'T RETRACT.  THE ENGINE HAS KNOCKING AND PINGING NOISES AT ALL SPEEDS, SO I TRIED SUPER UNLEADED TO SEE IF THE ENGINE KNOCKING AND PINGING NOISES WOULD STOP, BUT THEY DIDN'T.  WHAT CONCERNS ME THE MOST IS THE FACT THAT MY SUSPENSION WAS INSPECTED BY NISSAN CORPORATION AND THEY THEMSELVES SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  AGAIN, LIKE I SAID BEFORE, THEY PUT SOME KIND OF RUBBER BETWEEN THE SPRINGS TO QUIET THE NOISE.  IT DID NOT LAST.  I HAVE ASKED INDEPENDENT NISSAN DEALERS IF THEY HAVE RAN INTO THIS PROBLEM.  THEY SAID YES.  THEY ALSO TOLD ME THAT NISSAN KNOWS THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM AND THAT THEY CAN FIX IT, BUT DO NOT WANT TO SPEND THE MONEY.  I BELIEVE THAT THEY WANTED FOR MY WARRANTY TO EXPIRE SO THAT I WOULD STOP COMPLAINING TO NISSAN ABOUT THEIR VEHICLE.  PRETTY MUCH, IT SEEMS LIKE A BOUGHT A LEMON.
