WELL THIS WEEK I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM GM STATING THAT IF THE LIGHT COMES ON OR IF YOU HAVE HAD AN ISSUE WITH THE LIGHT COMING ON TO TAKE IT TO YOUR DEALER.THESE ARE THE EXACT WORDS IN THE LETTER: IF THIS CONDITION OCCURS ON YOUR 2006 CHEVROLET HHR, THE CONDITION WILL BE REPAIRED FOR YOU AT NO CHARGE. TODAY TOOK MY CAR IN FOR A ROUTINE SERVICE  AND ASK THE DEALER ABOUT THE LETTER AND HE SAID HE WOULD CHECK ON IT. A FEW MINUTES LATER HE TOLD ME THEY HAD A POWER STEERING MOTOR IN STOCK AND IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT 45 MINUTES TO INSTALL IF I HAD THE TIME AND I SAID I COULD WAIT.     HE CAME TO THE WAITING ROOM AND SAID I WAS READY TO GO AND THE STEERING MOTOR WAS NOT THE PROBLEM CAUSING THE LIGHT, BUT THE STEERING CONTROL MODULE WHICH IS PART OF THE STEERING COLUMN ASSEMBLY AND NOT COVERED BY THE LETTER. WELL GUESS WHAT, THE STEERING COLUMN ASSEMBLY IS ONLY SOLD WITH A NEW STEERING MOTOR, SO IF I REPLACED THE COLUMN GM GETS $578.59 FOR THE PART PLUS LABOR COST TO INSTALL AND THEY PAY FOR NOTHING TO CURE THE ISSUE. I WAS A MECHANIC ON ROAD TRUCKS AND HEAVY EQUIPMENT FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND KNOW IF YOU HAVE AN ELECTRIC MOTOR IT  HAS TO GET IT'S COMMANDS ON HOW TO REACT FROM SOME TYPE OF CONTROL SOURCE ( STEERING CONTROL MODULE) WOULD BE MY GUESS WOULDN'T YOU THINK.     NO WHERE IN MY LETTER DOES IT STATE STEERING MOTOR ONLY IS COVERED TO SOLVE THE ISSUE AND NO WHERE ON THE REIMBURSEMENT REQUEST FORM DOES IT SAY THEY WILL ONLY REIMBURSE FOR THE MOTOR. I HAD AN ONLINE CHAT WITH A GM CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS TOLD ONLY THE MOTOR ACCORDING TO HER WRITTEN INFORMATION. WHEN I REQUESTED A COPY OF WHAT IS COVERED, I WAS TOLD TO ASK THE DEALER FOR A COPY.   *TR",

I BOUGHT THE NEW SHIFTER THAT IS MADE MUCH BETTER AND I NEED TO HAVE IT INSTALLED. I WILL TRY TO STAY WITH THE ONE PROBLEM POWER STEERING .

I SLOWED DOWN AND IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT HOME.  WE CONTACTED OUR LOCAL DEALER, AND HAD THE CAR BROUGHT IN TO BE CHECKED OUT.  WE WERE TOLD THE FRONT BUSHINGS WERE BAD & NEEDED REPLACING.   THE DEALER REPLACED THE BUSHINGS. (UNDER WARRANTY)         IN SEPTEMBER OF 2007,  WE HAD TO REPLACE OUR CARS REMOTE CONTROL, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ONLY 1 YEARS OLD.  OUR DEALER REPLACED IT BUT WE HAD TO PAY $81.82 OUT OF OUR POCKET.      OCTOBER 2007,  I BROUGHT OUR CAR INTO OUR DEALER BECAUSE IT HAD A ROUGH RIDE AND GROANING SOUNDS.  THE DEALER LOOKED AT IT AND SAID THE SOUND WAS COMING FROM THE STEERING COLUMN.  THEY REPLACED OUR STEERING COLUMN UNDER WARRANTY.  DECEMBER OF 2007 MY WIFE, MOTHER & I WENT TO A CHRISTMAS LIGHT PARADE IN OUR TOWN; WHEN WE GOT HOME I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION & WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE THE KEY, IT WOULD NOT COME OUT.  THAT MONDAY I CALLED OUR LOCAL DEALER & THEY HAD US BRING IN THE CAR ON 12/3/07.  THEY REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO POWER TO THE INTER LOCK2 AND A FUSE HAD BROWN.  THEY FOUND THAT A WIRE HARNESS WAS PINCHED UNDER THE COLUMN COVER & REPAIRED THE HARNESS (UNDER WARRANTY)      JANUARY 29,2008 I BROUGHT OUR 2006 HHR INTO OUR DEALER AGAIN COMPLAINING ABOUT SQUEAKING AND POPPING NOISE WITH CLUNKING IN LEFT FRONT.

I CHECKED MY MANUAL WHICH TOLD ME NOT TO KEEP DRIVING, CALLED MY HUSBAND WHO IS A FORMER AUTO TECH, AND HE ADVISED ME TO START THE CAR AGAIN TO SEE IF THE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN. IT DIDN'T, SO HE THOUGHT THAT MAYBE IT WAS A TEMPORARY PROBLEM AND ADVISED ME TO DRIVE CAUTIOUSLY, BUT TO PULL OVER IF IT CAME ON AGAIN.    I WAS MORE THAN AN HOUR FROM HOME (DENTON, MD.)

IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO STEER, ESPECIALLY MAKING A 90-DEGREE TURN. IT WAS GETTING DARK, AND I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT PARKING IN A SAFE PLACE TO WAIT FOR MY HUSBAND TO MEET UP WITH ME.

THE CAR WAS VERY HARD TO MANEUVER, I STOPPED THE CAR AND TURNED IT OFF. I NEEDED TO GET IT BACK INTO MY DRIVE WAY SO I TURNED THE CAR ON TO GO BACK HOME, ONCE I TURNED THE CAR BACK ON THE STEERING HAD GONE BACK TO NORMAL. I ASSUMED IT HAD ONLY BEEN A GLITCH BUT DIDN'T DRIVE MY CAR THAT DAY ONCE I GOT IT BACK HOME. I DROVE MY CAR FOR ABOUT A WEEK WHEN THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN, I HEARD A CHIME AND MY DASH DISPLAYED POWER STEERING, I WAS ON A BUSY ROAD AND HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PULL OVER, ONCE I DID I TURNED THE CAR OFF THEN BACK ON, THE STEERING ONCE AGAIN WENT BACK TO NORMAL. THE NEXT DAY I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY GOING APPROXIMATELY 70-80 MPH WHEN THE CAR ONCE AGAIN DISPLAYED POWER STEERING ON THE DASH AND IT BECAME VERY HARD TO OPERATE THE STEERING WHEEL, I STOPPED THE CAR AND LEFT IT AT A REST AREA ALONG THE HIGHWAY BECAUSE I WAS TOO AFRAID IT WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN BEFORE I COULD GET OFF THE HIGH WAY AND SAFELY BACK HOME AND HAD TO HAVE A FRIEND DRIVE IT BACK TO MY HOME. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DRIVE MY CAR IN ABOUT 2 WEEKS BECAUSE INSTEAD OF IT HAPPENING EVERY FEW DAYS, I NOW CANT MAKE IT A MILE OUT OF MY SUBDIVISION WITHOUT IT HAPPENING. IM AFRAID IT WILL CAUSE ME TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT IN THE VEHICLE. I'VE SPOKEN TO GENERAL MOTORS, WHICH THEY HAVE TOLD ME THAT IT IS ONLY MY VEHICLE THAT IS HAVING THE PROBLEM, WHICH IS NOT TRUE, ON ANY GIVEN SEARCH ENGINE YOU CAN TYPE \"CHEVY HHR STEERING PROBLEMS\" AND SEE PAGES UPON PAGES OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM AND HAVE EVEN BEEN IN ACCIDENTS BECAUSE OF IT. THE COBALT WAS RECALLED BECAUSE OF THE SAME PROBLEM. THE ISSUE SHOULD BE FIXED BY GM BECAUSE IT'S A VERY COMMON ISSUE WITH HHR'S. *TR",

ABOUT 1 MONTH AGO THE INSIDE PASSENGER DOOR HANDLE BROKE OFF IN THE SAME WAY    THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN I STOP THE CAR, TAKE MY KEYS FROM THE IGNITION AND THEN REALIZE I CANNOT OPEN MY DOOR, SO HAVE TO REINSERT MY KEY TO TURN THE CAR ON ENOUGH TO ALLOW FOR THE POWER WINDOWS TO GO DOWN, SO I CAN REACH OUT AND OPEN MY DOOR FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE CAR. THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW OCCASIONS THAT I HAVE ROLLED MY WINDOW BACK UP AND LOCKED AND EXITED MY CAR FORGETTING THAT I HAD PUT MY KEYS BACK IN TO POWER THE WINDOWS, WHEN I RETURN MY KEYS ARE LOCKED IN MY CAR AND THE BATTERY IS DEAD....THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING! AND THIS HAPPENED THIS MORNING WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT THE FRONT DOOR DIDN'T LOCK. I GOT INSIDE SHUT THE DOOR, REALIZED THAT ONCE AGAIN I HAD LEFT MY KEYS INSIDE( BECAUSE OF HAVING TO REINSERT TO ROLL THE WINDOW DOWN TO GET OUT) BEGAN TO START MY CAR AND THE BATTERY WAS DEAD SO I COULD NOT OPEN THE DOOR BY ROLLING THE WINDOW DOWN, NOR UNLOCK THE BACK DOORS BECAUSE THE LOCKS DID NOT WORK DUE TO THE BATTERY BEING DRAINED! SO THIS IS NOT A MERE INCONVENIENCE ANYMORE IT IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE!IMAGINE BEING TRAPPED IN YOUR CAR! PLEASE HELP US BECAUSE WE ARE BEING TOLD THERE IS NO RECALL ON THIS EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE MANY REPORTS ON THE INTERNET, AND THERE IS A SAFETY RECALL ON A LATCH OF A COMPARTMENT ON THE DASH, WHICH IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THIS ISSUE...THE COST OF REPAIR IS COMPLETELY UN- REACHABLE FOR US ALSO...THIS SHOULD BE FIXED AT THE COST OF THE CAR MANUFACTURER...OUR CAR IS LESS THAN 6 YEARS OLD AND WEAR AND TEAR MIGHT BE THE CASE IF IT WAS 1 HANDLE NOT BOTH!!

IT TOOK THEM TWO WEEKS TO FIGURE OUT THE TRANSMISSION WAS BLOWN. I WAS CALLED TODAY AND HAD WITH A VERY CONFUSING CONVERSATION WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER. I WAS TOLD THAT I HAD TWO OPTIONS FOR GETTING MY CAR REPAIRED. IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME THAT I COULD EITHER GET A USED TRANSMISSION WITH 33,000 MILES ON IT ALREADY AND IT WOULD BE COVERED BY A ONE YEAR WARRANTY (THE TRANSMISSION THAT JUST BROKE DOWN WITH ONLY 55,000 MILES ON IT). OR I COULD GET A NEW TRANSMISSION AND PAY THE DIFFERENCE OF 1,500.00 DOLLARS WHICH SEEMS UNFAIR TO ME. THIS IS A SHORT SUMMARY OF WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED AND IT IS VERY DISCOURAGING TO MY DAUGHTER AND I.

IF I WAS IN AN ACCIDENT AND HAD A ELECTRICAL FAILURE I COULD NOT EXIT THE CAR BECAUSE I COULD NOT ROLL DOWN THE WINDOW.  EVERYTHING I HAVE FOUND IN MY RESEARCH IS THAT CHEVROLET IS NOT RECGONIZING THIS AS A REAL PROBLEM AND FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN/READ THEY HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM WHEN IT OCCURS OR HELP THE VEHICLE OWNERS IN ANY WAY.  I HAVE CHECKED ON THE REPAIR AND FOUND THAT THE DOOR HANDLE ITSELF CAN NOT BE REPLACED THAT YOU HAVE TO BUY AN ENTIRE DOOR PANEL FOR OVER $400 AND THAT IS JUST THE PART, NO LABOR.

I CALLED TO GET A REPLACEMENT HANDLE AND WAS TOLD IT WOULD COST ME $300 FOR THE ENTIRE DOOR KIT.  I DON'T WANT AN ENTIRE DOOR, BUT EVIDENTLY GM DESIGNED THE HANDLE TO BE AN INTEGRATED PART OF THE DOOR TRIM.  THEN I CALLED GM CUSTOMER SERVICE, THEY TOLD ME THEY HAVE NEVER HAD A SINGLE COMPLAINT ABOUT THIS HAPPENING EVER BEFORE.  I FIND THIS TO BE A TOTAL LIE SINCE I JUST READ OF A WOMAN WHO CALLED GM TO COMPLAIN AND THEY TOLD HER THE EXACT SAME THING \"WE'VE NEVER HAD A SINGLE COMPLAINT\".  I CANNOT OPEN MY CAR DOOR FROM THE INSIDE.  THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN FOR ME.  IF I WERE IN A WRECK OR IF THE BATTERY DIED I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF MY CAR, AS I HAVE TO ROLL DOWN MY WINDOW, REACH OUT AND OPEN THE DOOR FROM THE OUTSIDE.  I'M VERY UPSET BY THIS ENTIRE SITUATION.

THE PROBLEM WE WERE HAVING WAS THAT SHE WOULD RANDOMLY LOSE POWER STEERING WITH A WARNING CHIME AND A NOTIFICATION ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. THIS WOULD BE TEMPORARILY RESOLVED BY RESTARTING THE VEHICLE. I WASTED LITTLE TIME AND HAD IT TESTED AT CLASSIC CHEVROLET IN SUGAR LAND,TX. THEY SOON DISCOVERED THAT THE POWER STEERING MOTOR WAS FAULTY. I HAD THEM REPLACE IT. NOW I'VE BEEN A LIFELONG GM CUSTOMER AND I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS EXPENSE, NOT ONLY WAS IT A FAILURE UNASSOCIATED TO NEGLECT BUT IT WAS ALSO A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM. THIS PROBLEM IS ALSO HIGHLY DOCUMENTED ON THE WEB BY MANY OTHER HHR OWNERS. AFTER GM ANNOUNCED THE RECALL OF 1.3MIL VEHICLES WITH THIS PROBLEM. THE HHR WAS NOT LISTED YET BUT THE CHEVY COBALT AND PONTIAC G5 WERE. THE HHR SHARES THE SAME POWER STEERING MOTOR AS THE COBALT AND G5. GM PART # 20763801. JTEKT NORTH AMERICA IS THE PRODUCER OF THIS MOTOR. FROM WHAT I DISCOVERED ON THE INTERNET, GM HAS FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST JTEKT  IN RESPONSE TO THIS ISSUE. IT IS STILL UNCLEAR TO ME HOW GM HAS NOT INCLUDED THIS MODEL IN THERE RECALL. I HAVE RECENTLY BEEN DENIED REIMBURSEMENT BY CHEVROLET FOR MY EXPENSES. *TR",

IT WAS STATED IN A FORUM THAT GM SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED A METAL COLLAR OR RING AROUND THE PLASTIC BIT THAT HOLDS THAT PIN TO REINFORCE IT AND THIS PROBLEM WOULD HAVE NEVER BECOME A NUISANCE.     ALSO, WHEN THAT PIN FALLS OUT, THE SHIFT LEVER IS FREE TO MOVE WITHOUT PRESSING THE SHIFT BUTTON ON THE FRONT OF THE SHIFT LEVER, SO IT COULD ACCIDENTALLY BE MOVED TO ANOTHER GEAR WHILE DRIVING, EVEN REVERSE!!

I INVESTIGATED THE ISSUE ON ON-LINE FORUMS AND FOUND THE ISSUE WAS AS FOLLOWS: \" A SMALL ACTUATOR ROD THAT GOES THROUGH THE SHIFTER STALK FALLS OUT DUE TO THE STALK CRACKING WHERE THE ROD GOES THROUGH IT. THE KEY RELEASE THEN NEVER GETS ACTIVATED SO YOU HAVE TO USE THE MANUAL RELEASE BUTTON ON THE BOTTOM OF THE STEERING COLUMN. THIS SHIFTER UNIT IS COMPLETELY UNSERVICEABLE AND THE ENTIRE SHIFTER BLOCK HAS TO BE REPLACED.NOTE THAT WITH NO ACTUATOR ROD THE SHIFT LEVER IS FREE TO MOVE WITHOUT PRESSING THE SHIFT BUTTON ON THE FRONT OF THE SHIFT LEVER, SO IT COULD ACCIDENTALLY BE MOVED TO ANOTHER GEAR WHILE DRIVING, EVEN REVERSE. ... CHEVY IS WRONG FOR PUTTING SUCH A CHEAP AND FLIMSY DEVICE ON THE CAR.\" THIS IS POINT THAT I MADE TO THE GM CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT BUT THEY STUCK TO THEIR GUNS THAT WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED. TO MY WAY OF THINKING EVEN THE REPLACEMENT SHIFTER  IS AT RISK IN THE FUTURE WITH HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. READING OTHER ON-LINE COMPLAINT LOGS, I NOTE THAT BECAUSE OF THE COST OF REPLACEMENT, IT WAS BEING ADVOCATED THAT SIMPLY USING THE MANUAL RELEASE BUTTON ON THE STEERING COLUMN WAS AN ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. OBVIOUSLY THIS LEAVES DRIVER'S IN A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS POSITION IF THE SHIFTER IS ACCIDENTALLY MOVED WHILE THE CAR IS MOVING. AS SUCH I FEEL THAT THERE IS REASON TO HAVE GM RECALL THESE VEHICLES TO REPLACE THESE \"CHEAP\" SHIFTERS AND TO REIMBURSE OWNERS SUCH AS MYSELF THAT HAVE INCURRED STEEP REPLACEMENT COSTS. *TR",

I READ MY OWNERS MANUAL AND FOUND THE HIDDEN RELEASE BUTTON IN THE STEERING COLUMN. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP, AND BECAUSE I AM OUT OF WARRANTY, I HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS REPAIR THAT IS DUE TO POOR CRAFTSMANSHIP. AFTER RESEARCHING THIS TO SEE IF WAS RECALLED, I HAVE UNCOVERED NUMEROUS CHEVROLET HHR OWNERS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM, AND IT IS A FAULTY SHIFT LINKAGE. THIS ITEM NEEDS TO BE ON THE RECALL LIST. *TR",

IT COULD'VE BEEN A LOT WORSE IF THERE WAS A DRIVER BEHIND ME.    I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP, MCCLUSKEY CHEVY., AND THEY CAME TO PICK UP THE CAR WHILE I HAD TO FIND ANOTHER WAY HOME. LATER ON I DISCOVERED THE LEFT SIDE BALL JOINT BROKE. THIS ISSUE IS A MANUFACTURING PROBLEM. I HAVE NOT HAD TRANSPORTATION FOR ALMOST A MONTH NOW. THIS SITUATION HAS BEEN SO STRESSFUL.     THE MINOR DAMAGES HAVE BEEN REPAIRED AND I DON'T HAVE EXTRA MONEY TO GET IT REPAIRED ON TOP OF MAKING A MONTHLY PAYMENT. THE COST OF THE REPAIRS IS OVER $2,000. I DON'T AGREE THAT I SHOULD BE THE ONE TO PAY FOR THE DAMAGES THAT WERE MADE FROM A PART FAILING. I HAVE ARGUED THIS SITUATION OVER AND OVER WITH THE SHOP WORKERS WHO DISAGREE.

A MAN WHO HAD THIS HAPPEN SAID WHEN HE HIT THE POT HOLE AND HIS CAR DIED HE NOTICED WHEN HE WENT TO RESTART THE CAR THAT HIS KEY HAS SLIPPED TO THE \"ACC\" POSITION. HE SUGGESTED WE TEST OUR KEYS BY PUTTING THEM IN THE IGNITION AND PLAYING AROUND WITH THEM. I WAS INTERESTED IN TRYING THIS AS THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS ISSUE!  I STARTED MY CAR AND TO MY HORROR DISCOVERED THAT WITH NO PRESSURE I CAN TURN MY CAR OFF. I ONLY HAVE 4 KEYS AND MY REMOTE ON MY KEY RING SO IT IS NOT DUE TO WEIGHT OF MY KEYRING. I CAN GRAB MY HANGING REMOTE, AND OTHER KEYS (I ONLY HELD ONE KEY) AND WITH NO PRESSURE I CAN TURN MY CAR OFF.

HOWEVER IN THE PAST MONTHS INTERMITTENTLY THE CAR HAS AGAIN HAD EPISODES OF \"TURNING ITSELF OFF\" AND THESE EPISODES HAVE BEEN INCREASING IN FREQUENCY AND HAVE BECOME EXTREMELY SCARY.

AFTER A FEW MONTHS I STARTED TO NOTICE A SLIGHT VIBRATION IN MY STEERING WHEEL WHEN BRAKING A FEW DAYS LATER THAT VIBRATION TURNED TO VIOLENT SHAKING AND RESISTANCE WHEN BRAKING. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER WHO INFORMED ME THE ROTORS WERE WARPED AND NEEDED TO BE REPAIRED. THIS WAS ROUGHLY AROUND 13000 MI. THE DEALER DID REPAIR THE ROTORS UNDER WARRANTY AND DIDN'T GIVE ME THE \"IT'S NORMAL WEAR & TEAR\" MUMBO. NEXT IS THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT KEEPS COMING ON. IT WILL STAY ON FOR A FEW DAYS AND THEN GO OFF. THIS HAS HAPPENED 3 TIMES ALREADY AND THE DEALER HAS REPLACED THE SENSOR EACH TIME. NOW WE ARE UP TO THE 4TH TIME AS IT CAME BACK ON AGAIN YESTERDAY. I HAVE ALSO HAD ISSUES WITH THE RADIO. THE RADIO HAS HAD POWER TO IT AND NO VOLUME. THIS HAPPENED 3-4 TIMES B/4 I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER WHO HAD TO RESET & REPROGRAM SOMETHING ON THE RADIO.  *TR",
