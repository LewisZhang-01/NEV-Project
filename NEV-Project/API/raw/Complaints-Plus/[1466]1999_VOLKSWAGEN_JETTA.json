THEY KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM AS THEY HAVE ISSUED A 7-YEAR EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE PART.  I HAVE HAD TO GET THE REGULATOR REPLACED ON MY FRONT PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW TWICE, DUE TO WINDOW FALLING INTO DOOR.  THIS WAS UNDER EXTENDED WARRANTY.  HOWEVER MY FRONT DRIVER SIDE WINDOW (WHICH I HARDLY EVER USE) HAS FALLEN INTO THE DOOR.  I AM NOW OUTSIDE OF THE EXTENDED WARRANTY PERIOD AND THE DEALERSHIP IS TRYING TO CHARGE ME $500 TO REPLACE THE REGULATOR.  I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SPEND $500 I DO NOT HAVE ON A PART THAT IS KNOWN AND WELL DOCUMENTED TO BE FAULTY.      THIS DEFECTIVE PART POSES SEVERAL DANGEROUS POSSIBILITIES.  FOR EXAMPLE I AM CURRENTLY DRIVING WITH PLASTIC WHERE THE WINDOW SHOULD BE TO SECURE THE CAR FROM WEATHER AND INTRUDERS.  I CAN HARDLY SEE THROUGH IT; THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS, IT IS A HUGE BLIND SPOT.   IF THERE IS AN ATTACKER I CAN NOT SHUT THE WINDOW.  I CAN NOT SECURE THE CAR.  IF THE WEATHER WAS BAD DRIVING WOULD BE DIFFICULT.  SOMETIMES THE FAULTY REGULATORS MAKE THE WINDOWS STUCK CLOSED.  IF THERE WAS A WRECK SOMEONE COULD GET TRAPPED INSIDE.

FINALLY, VW CAPISTRANO FORCED THEIR HAND AND PROCESSED IT THROUGH MY THEN CURRENT WARRANTY.  AT THE TIME, I HAD 45K MILES ON THE CAR.  I THOUGHT IT SHOCKING THAT A CAR SO YOUNG SHOULD HAVE SUCH A MAJOR PROBLEM (FOR THE SECOND TIME).  WHEN I PICKED CAR UP, A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER, I HEARD A LOUD CRUNCHING NOISE IN THE FRONT LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE MOTOR OR WHEEL.  I THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT, DROVE IT ANOTHER 5000 MILES, HAD TO REPLACE 4 TIRES, AND ASKED THE TIRE TECH TO CHECK IT OUT.  HE SAID IT WAS THE STEERING KNUCKLE AND IT WAS IN BAD SHAPE.  I CONTACTED VW WHO SAID, BAD LUCK, IT'S ONLY COVERED FOR 24K MILES OR 2YEARS.  I AGAIN AM SHOCKED, FIRSTLY BECAUSE THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE ONE OF THESE SHOULD GO OUT SO EARLY, ADDED TO THAT, IF THE BALL JOINT WAS REPLACED, THEN ISN'T THE STEERING KNUCKLE, MOVED IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM, SO THERE SHOULD BE SOME SORT OF RECOURSE.  THIS CAR IS A LEMON, HOWEVER, CA LAW STATES IT ISN'T.

ALSO, THE BACK RIGHT SEAT BELT IS FIXED TO THE SEAT AND IS UNUSABLE, I COMPLAINED IT WAS DANGEROUS, FORD SAID TOO BAD, YOU BOUGHT IT THAT WAY FIX IT.

A COMPANY WHO HAS HAD THESE VERY SAME PROBLEMS IN THE PAST WITH OTHER MODELS AND YEARS ISN'T TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEFECTIVE PARTS.  I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH VW SERVICE, BOTH AT THE DEALER AND THERE HEADQUARTERS FOR NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THE PROBLEM AND FOR NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY.  THERE IS AN ATTORNEY WHO IS DOING A CLASS ACTION INVESTIGATION INTO THE IGNITION COIL PAK PROBLEM.  IT IS GG&D, GIRARD, GIBBS, AND DE BARTOLOMEO.  THEY ARE BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO AND HAVE A WEB SITE.  YOU CAN EMAIL THEM IF YOU'VE HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH YOUR IGNITION COIL PACK NEEDING REPLACING.

I AM TOLD THAT MY EXTENDED WARRANTY WILL COVER THE COST OF REPLACEMENT, BUT HAVE NO CONFIRMATIN OF THIS YET.  VW SHOULD DO A NATIONAL RECALL AND FIX ALL THESE WINDOWS FOR FREE.

I WAS TOLD THAT THEY COULD PUT THE WINDOW IN THE UP POSITION FOR ME, BUT IT WOULD BE A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE THEY COULD ACTUALLY FIX THE PROBLEM.  ON JULY 14, I DECIDED TO GO TO A REPAIR SHOP  (ANTHONY\u0012S CORNER INC., LOCATED IN MT. HOLLY, NJ) THAT COULD HOPEFULLY FIX THE PROBLEM MUCH SOONER.  THE REPAIRMAN AT ANTHONY\u0012S PUT THE WINDOW IN THE UP POSITION AND ORDERED A NEW WINDOW REGULATOR FOR ME.  ABOUT A WEEK LATER IT CAME TO MY ATTENTION THAT VW IS AWARE OF THIS COMMON PROBLEM, SO I WAS HOPEFUL THAT VW WOULD COVER THE COSTS OF THE REPAIR.  I FILLED OUT THE CUSTOMER CARE FORM ON VW.COM JULY 24 EXPLAINING THE PROBLEM THAT I WAS HAVING.  A VW CUSTOMER CARE REP LEFT ME A VOICE MAIL MESSAGE THE NEXT DAY, SO I FOLLOWED UP WITH THEM ON JULY 26.  THE VW CUSTOMER CARE REP INFORMED ME THAT I NEEDED TO TAKE MY VEHICLE TO A VW DEALER FOR THEM TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM, THUS REQUIRING ME TO PAY A DIAGNOSTIC FEE FOR SOMETHING I ALREADY KNEW WAS BROKE.  IN ADDITION, I WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THEY WILL CONSIDER ASSISTING ME.  I THEN CALLED BACK TO BURLINGTON VW ON JULY 26, AND SPOKE TO SOMEONE IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  I WAS THEN TOLD THERE WAS KNOW NEED TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE \u0013THE PART IS ON NATIONAL BACK ORDER\u0014.  ADDITIONALLY, I WAS TOLD BY THE BURLINGTON VW REPAIRMAN THAT SINCE I HAVE OVER 36,000 MILES (VW GOOD-WILL PERIOD) VW WILL NOT COVER THE COST OF THE REPAIR.  IN CONCLUSION, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM ANTHONY\u0012S JULY 27, LETTING ME KNOW THAT THE WINDOW REGULATOR HAD COME IN.  IN MY OPINION VW IS HIDING THE FACT THAT THIS MODEL YEAR (AND MAYBE OTHERS) HAVE DEFECTIVE WINDOW REGULATORS.

THE CAR DDROVE NORMAL FOR ABOUT ONE MONTH THEN WE BEGAN NOTICING THE SAME PROBLEMS AGAIN WITH THE TRANSMISSION. ON 06-24-2001 THE TRANSMISSION FAILED AGAIN ONLY GOING INTO DRIVE AND NO OTHER GEARS. ALSO ON MAY 11, 2001 THE REAR WINDSHIELD EXPLODED AND CRACKED FOR NO APPARENT REASON WE HAD TO PAY FOR REPLACING IT.  ALSO ON 06-20-2001 THE WATER/FLUID LIGHT BEGAN FLASHING ON THE DASHBOARD WE ALSO HAD THIS FIXED.  WE WOULD DESPERATELY LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU CONCERNING THIS COMPLAINT. ANY INFORMATION YOU CAN OFFER US WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. THANK YOU - MARTHA PARE. *AK",

AFTER 3 MINUTES THE CAR DIED AND NEEDED TO BE TOWED.  IT WAS TOWED TO A VW DEALER AND THEY CONTACTED VW.  THE VW REP SAID THAT THERE WAS A SERVICE BULLETIN OUT AND DIRECTED THE DEALER TO DRILL OUT THE CHECK VALVE ON THE FUEL SENDING UNIT.  I PICKED THE CAR UP ON WEDNESDAY THE 19TH AND DROVE IT WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.  ON FRIDAY, I HAD DRIVEN FOR ABOUT 1/2 HOUR ON INTERSTATE 91 AND THE CAR DID THE SAME THING.  I COASTED TO THE BREAKDOWN LANE AND THE CAR STALLED.  ONCE AGAIN IT COULD NOT BE RESTARTED.  IT WAS TOWED TO GENE LANGAN VW IN GLASTONBURY.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS DEFECT THAT COULD RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT IF THE DRIVER CANNOT SAFELY NEGOTIATE THE VEHICLE OFF OF THE HIGHWAY.  WHEN I SPOKE WITH VW ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE ON THE EVENING OF JANUARY 21ST, THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE GETTING HUNDREDS OF CALLS ABOUT THE 1999 DIESELS JUST DYING AFTER PROLONGED PERIODS OF DRIVING.
