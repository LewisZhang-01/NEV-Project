TIPPED SEAT FORWARD AND FOUND THE SEAT BELT WAS STUCK IN THE LACH AND DAMAGED. THE DEALER WAS NOTIFIED AND HE SAID THEY WILL REPLACE THE SEAT BELT. BUT THAT WILL NOT STOP IT FROM HAPPENING. THE SEAT BELT HANGS LOOSE AND NEEDS TO HAVE SOME SORT OF HOLDER TO KEEP IT FIRM AGAINST THE SIDE PANEL TO AVOID THE SEAT BELT FALLING INTO THE LATCH AREA AND GETTING STUCK IN THE LATCH AND CAUSING THE SEAT NOT TO LATCH AND DAMAGING THE SEAT BELT. THE DEALER SAID HE LOOKED AT AN IDENTICAL VEHICLE ON THE LOT AND FOUND THAT VEHICLE HAD SAME EXACT ISSUE AND DAMAGED THAT SEAT BELT TOO. HE SAID AT THIS TIME THERE IS NO SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. THERE ARE SMALL NOTCHES IN THE SIDE PANEL THAT APPEAR MIGHT BE FOR A BRACKET OR SOME TYPE OF STRAP. BUT THE DEALER SAID THERE IS NOTHING AVAILABLE AND HAS NO IDEA WHAT THOSE NOTCHES ARE FOR. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION. THE SEAT WILL NOT LATCH IF BELT IS JAMMED IN IT AND IT IS DAMAGING THE SEAT BELTS. I CAN ONLY GUESS HOW MANY SEAT BELTS CONSUMERS MIGHT GO THROUGH EVERYTIME IT GETS JAMMED.",
