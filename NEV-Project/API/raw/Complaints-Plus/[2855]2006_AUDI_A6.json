TO ME IF THEY HAVE HAD A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THESE COILS THAT THEY SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM OR BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIRS. THEY SAID BECAUSE THERE IS NO CURRENT RECALL THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO, AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE HAD A RECALL FOR ALL THERE CARS FOR THE LAST 6 YEARS MEANS NOTHING...
