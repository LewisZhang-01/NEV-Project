HOWEVER ONCE COMPLETING THE FULL LEFT U-TURN, AND DRIVING STRAIGHT CENTER WHEEL POSITION, THE AIRBAG FAULT INDICATOR LIGHT AND WARNING TONES WOULD REOCCUR.

I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP TO INQUIRE OF THE REPLACEMENT CLOCKSPRING PART COST, AND WAS QUOTED IN THE $450.00 RANGE PLUS LABOR TECH INSTALL.  IN ADDITION, WAS TOLD THE PART WAS ON BACK ORDER.  IT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A KNOWN DEFECT ON THIS MODEL AND SINCE IS AIRBAG RELATED, SHOULD BE CORRECTED BY THE MANUFACTURER, WHICH IS GENERAL MOTORS.  I COULD BE LIKE THOUSANDS OF OTHER OWNERS TO MISINTERPRET THE SEVERITY OF THIS DEFECT, AND BE DRIVING A VEHICLE THAT WILL FAIL TO SAVE MY LIFE IF EVER INVOLVED IN A MAJOR COLLISION.

THIS PREMATURE FAILURE MAY OCCUR ON ANY FRONT, REAR, LEFT, OR RIGHT DOOR.  WITH LESS THAN 40,000 TOTAL PONTIAC G8 PRODUCED, IDENTICAL FAILURES ON MULTIPLE OWNERS' VEHICLES INDICATE THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED FAILURE.  THE ELECTRONIC MOTOR WITHIN THE DOOR LOCK/LATCH MECHANISM IS NOT ROBUST ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND REPEATED LOCKING/UNLOCKING FUNCTIONS.  THE RESULT OF THIS FAILURE IS THAT THE DOOR WILL NO LONGER LOCK/UNLOCK.    THE DOOR LOCK DESIGN DOES NOT ALLOW FOR MANUAL OVERRIDE OF SLIDING THE INTERIOR LOCK HANDLE UNLESS ELECTRICAL CURRENT IS APPLIED TO THE MOTOR.    GM USED TO COVER THE COST OF REPLACING THESE PARTS UNDER THE 3-YEAR, 36,000-MILE BUMPER-TO-BUMPER WARRANTY.  THE AGE OF THESE VEHICLES HAS DETERMINED THAT THE PARTS ARE NO LONGER COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  OWNERS MUST REPAIR THE DEFECT AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE.  NEW OEM PARTS HAVE NOT BEEN REVISED TO IMPROVE QUALITY.  OWNERS HAVE NO PERMANENT SOLUTION TO THIS FAILURE AS THE REPLACEMENT PART WILL AGAIN REQUIRE REPLACEMENT AT OWNERS' EXPENSE.  THE PARTS ARE DEFECTIVE WHICH GM FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE, AND ISSUE A SAFETY RECALL.

THERE HAVE BEEN PRIOR RECALLS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAMMING ON THE AIR BAG SYSTEM AND MY CAR HAS HAD AN AIRBAG MODULE REPLACED ONCE ALREADY.  A QUICK SEARCH ON THE INTERNET SHOWS NUMEROUS OTHER PEOPLE EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE ON PONTIAC G8S THAT IN MANY CASES HAVE EVEN LESS MILES THAN MINE ON THEM.  MANY OF THE STORIES ONLINE ARE LITTERED WITH DEALER ESTIMATES TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM, WITH REPAIRS RUNNING UPWARDS OF $900+ TO REPLACE ONE MODULE (GM PART NO. 92225595), AND THAT MIGHT NOT EVEN FIX THE PROBLEM.  IN SOME CASES DEALERS ARE DIAGNOSING THE SENSOR (GM PART NO. 92220398) AS HAVING TO BE REPLACED AS WELL, WHICH IS ANOTHER $900+.      I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS ISSUE (AT LEAST THAT ARE REPORTING IT ONLINE) AND THERE MUST BE MANY OTHERS AS WELL THAT HAVEN'T TAKEN TO THE ONLINE FORUMS TO REPORT THEIR PROBLEM.  WITH A REPAIR AS COSTLY AS THIS ONE (ON A CAR WHOSE MARKET VALUE IS ROUGHLY $15,000) I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE MANY ARE MAKING THE REQUIRED REPAIRS AS THE COST TO DO IT IS SIGNIFICANT (AND IN MY CASE >10% OF THE TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF THE CAR).      I WOULD APPRECIATE A FURTHER LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE WITH A FOCUS ON HOW MANY OF GM PART NO. 92225595 HAVE BEEN MANUFACTURED/BOUGHT IN THE LAST 3 YEARS FOR USE ON A PONTIAC G8.

THIS BLATANTLY INDICATES THAT GM IS WELL AWARE OF THE ISSUE SINCE THEY ARE THE ONES WHO RECOMMENDED ME TO REPLACE THE FAULTY PART WITH THIS \"UPDATED\" PART.    THIS WOULD NOT BE SUCH A BIG ISSUE BECAUSE I AM WELL AWARE OF THE FACT THAT SOME PARTS ARE SUBJECT TO BEING REPLACED BECAUSE OF NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR, BUT THIS IS A MODULE THAT LITERALLY SITS UNDER THE PASSENGER SEAT BOTTOM, AND IS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY KIND OF OUTSIDE ELEMENTS, MECHANICAL MOVING CAPABILITY, OR THE ELEMENTS, SO THE ONLY WAY THIS PART COULD FAIL IS BECAUSE OF AN IMPROPER DESIGN OR OTHER ELEMENT THAT THE CUSTOMER HAS NO CONTROL OVER.
