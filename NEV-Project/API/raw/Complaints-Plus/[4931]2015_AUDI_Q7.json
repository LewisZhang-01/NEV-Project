        "summary": "AFTER BUYING MY NEW 2015 AUDI Q7 ON 9/27/14, I STARTED EXPERIENCING HESITATIONS WHEN PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC FROM DEAD STOPS. THE VERY FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED I WAS IN THE MEDIAN OF A 4-LANE HIGHWAY WAITING TO TURN LEFT INTO TRAFFIC. I PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR IT STARTED INTO THE LANE OF TRAFFIC THEN STOPPED. I SAT THERE FOR ABOUT 2-3 SECONDS BEFORE IT TOOK OFF. I EXPECTED TO GET HIT. IT WASN'T THE GAS NOR ME. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR 38 YEARS AND DRIVEN OVER 20 VEHICLES AND HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS BEFORE. IT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN RANDOMLY AND ALWAYS UNEXPECTEDLY SOMETIMES 1 TIME A WEEK SOMETIMES 3 TIMES A WEEK. THE HESITATION IS AS MUCH AS 3-4 SECONDS. ON 4/18/15 I BROUGHT IT IN TO AUDI OF NEW ORLEANS. THEY CALLED STATING THAT THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND TO COME PICK IT UP. I PICKED IT UP RIGHT AT CLOSING. UPON LEAVING THE DEALERSHIP, I STOPPED TO WAIT FOR TRAFFIC, PROCEEDED TO MAKE MY RIGHT TURN, AND IT HAPPENED. ON 5/25/15 I BROUGHT IT TO AUDI OF BATON ROUGE, WHICH IS WHERE I BOUGHT IT. THEY CALLED ME ON 5/29/15 AND TOLD ME: THAT THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE WHAT I WAS EXPERIENCING; THAT THE TECHNICIAN KNEW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT, BUT THAT IS JUST THE WAY THE Q7S ARE; AND THAT THE TECHNICIAN WANTED TO RIDE AROUND WITH ME WHEN I COME TO PICK IT UP. THAT AFTERNOON AND I DROVE AROUND WITH THE TECHNICIAN FIRST IN ANOTHER Q7 THEN IN MY Q7. I COULD NOT REPRODUCE IT WITH EITHER CAR. HOWEVER, THE TECHNICIAN DID TELL ME THAT HE KNEW WHAT I WAS EXPERIENCING AND THAT THAT IS JUST HOW THE Q7S ARE AND THAT THE REASON IS BECAUSE WHEN I PRESS THE ACCELERATOR THE COMPUTER TAKES CONTROL AND DECIDES IF IT WILL GIVE ME THE POWER I NEED TO PROCEED. I BELIEVE THAT NO CAR SHOULD HESITATE AND PUT PEOPLE IN JEOPARDY BY NOT GIVING THE ENGINE THE GAS IT NEEDS TO PERFORM AS IT SHOULD. I ALSO FEEL THAT AUDI SHOULD MAKE ALL DRIVERS AND FUTURE DRIVERS OF Q7S AWARE OF ITS BEHAVIOR. ...UPDATED 10/01/15*BF    UPDATED 12/05/2017*CN",

THE CAR (AUDI Q7, 2015), CONTINUED TO MOVE FORWARD UNTIL SHE HIT THE CAR PARKED IN FRONT OF HER.  SHE QUICKLY LET OFF THE BREAK PEDAL AND RE-APPLIED THE BRAKES AND THE CAR STOPPED; ALTHOUGH, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE IMPACT.  LUCKILY THIS HAPPENED IN A PARKING LOT; HOWEVER, NOW SHE IS CONCERNED THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN ON THE ROAD AT HIGHER SPEEDS.  SHE TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP, WHERE THEY TOLD US THAT THEY CALLED CORPORATE AUDI ABOUT THE SITUATION AND THAT THEY SENT EXPERTS IN TO EVALUATE THE CAR, WHO FOUND NOTHING WRONG (I GUESS THE EXPERTS WERE ABLE TO COME IN AND EVALUATE THE CAR WITHIN 12 HOURS, AS WE DROPPED THE CAR OFF AFTER 5PM AND THEY TOLD US THE NEXT DAY THAT THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM).  THEY STATED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO SINCE THEY DID NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR.  THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT IT HAPPENED.",
