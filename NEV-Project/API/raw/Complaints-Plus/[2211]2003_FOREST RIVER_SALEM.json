EACH TIME THE TIRE WOULD BLOW IT WOULD BLOW UP WITH PIECES OF RUBBER FLYING EVERY WHERE CAUSING EXCESSIVE DAMAGE TO THE RV AND CAUSING THE TRAILER TO BECOME DIFFICULT TO CONTROL UNTIL STOPPED AND OFF THE ROADWAY. THIS WAS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF FOREST RIVER AND ALSO CARLISLE TIRE COMPANY.  IN 2005 WE WERE CONTACTED BY A LOCAL RV DEALER TO BRING OUR TRAILER IN TO HAVE THE AXELS REPLACED WITH A HEAVER AXEL AND LARGER G RATED TIRES. THE EXPENSE WAS BEING PAID FOR BY FOREST RIVER. THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE SENDING OUT LETTERS TO ABOUT 13 OTHER OWNERS IN THE UTAH AND WYOMING AREA TO HAVE THIER TRAILERS BROUGHT IN FOR THE TRADE OUT AS WELL. I ALSO KNOW OF PEOPLE WHO OWN THE SAME TRAILER IN THE LAS VEGAS AREA WHO HAVE EXPERIANCED THE SAME PROBLEMS. THIS ACTION SEEMED TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM FOR ABOUT A YEAR. SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE CONTINUED TO HAVE SEVERAL MORE BLOW OUTS. EACH AND EVERY TIME CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE RV AND CAUSING A SAFETY PROBLEM TO OUR SELVES AND OTHER VEH'S TRAVELING NEAR TO US.    FOREST RIVER HAS CHANGED THE DESIGN ON THESE TRAILERS AND NOW IS SELLING THEM PROVIDED WITH A TRIPLE AXEL TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF THE TRAILER. I BELIEVE THIS HAS CORRECTED THE PROBLEM, HOWEVER, WE AND MANY OTHERS OR STUCK WITH THE TANDOM AXEL TRAILERS THAT WERE PRODUCED BEFORE THE PROBLEM WAS CORRECTED.
