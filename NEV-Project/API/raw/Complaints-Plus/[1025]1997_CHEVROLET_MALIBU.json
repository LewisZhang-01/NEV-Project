IT IS NOW READY FOR A NEW SET OF ROTORS AND BRAKES.  THE LAST TIME THESE WERE REPLACED ON THE CAR WAS 2 YEARS AGO.  GM KNEW ABOUT THE BRAKE PROBLEM FROM DAY ONE.  THE 1997 AND 1998 MODELS HAVE HAD NUMEROUS BRAKE PROBLEMS WITH THEM.  THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE NO ONE HAS GOTTEN KILLED FROM THE PROBLEM.   DO I HAVE TO DIE IN A WRECK BEFORE SOMEONE LISTENS??   2 YEARS AGO WHEN I HAD IT FIXED I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THE LAST TIME, BUT NO, THE BRAKES AND ROTORS STILL DON'T FIT MY CAR RIGHT OR THEY WOULDN'T WEAR LIKE THEY DO.  GM NEED TO FIX THE PROBLEM ON MY CAR.  THEY SEEM TO HAVE CORRECTED THE PROBLEM ON THE 2000 MODELS JUST FINE.  *JB",

IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS MY VEHICLE HAS BEGUN TO HAVE A MULTITUDE OF PROBLEMS THAT HAD LED UP TO MY CURRENT FIASCO. ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO AFTER AN OIL CHANGE MY 97 MALIBU BEGAN TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH A LIFTER TICKING. MY MECHANIC SUSPECTS A COLLAPSED LIFTER; THIS HAS NOT BEEN REPAIRED YET. MY CAR ALSO NOW RUNS VERY ROUGH AND DOES NOT HAVE THE POWER IT USED TO HAVE. TODAY 10/2/03 I HAD TO DRIVE INTO SEATTLE AND BEGAN TO HAVE A SEVERE HEATING PROBLEM WITH THE CAR. MY WIFE AND I WERE DEATHLY AFRAID WE WERE GOING TO BE STRANDED ON THE FREEWAY SOMEWHERE OR STUCK IN A PART OF SEATTLE WE DID NOT FEEL VERY SAFE IN. THE TEMP GAUGE BEGAN TO RISE VERY QUICKLY AS WE ARRIVED AT OUR DESTINATION JUST SOUTH OF SEATTLE, THE NEEDLE WAS PEGGED AND THE TEMP LIGHT ACTUALLY CAME ON. I HAD DEX-COOL ANTI-FREEZE LEAKING ALL OVER THE ENGINE AND ALL OVER THE GROUND. WE WAITING APPROX 30 MINUTES BEFORE WE STARTED OUT AGAIN AND YES WERE AFRAID THE ENTIRE WAY HOME THAT WE WOULD GET STRANDED ON THE ROAD SOMEWHERE. I GOT THE CAR TO MY MECHANIC AND HE HAS INFORMED US THAT WE PROBABLY NEED A NEW ENGINE, ON A CAR THAT ONLY HAS 95,000 MILES ON IT. I HAVE READ OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET ABOUT THE FAULTY GASKETS WHICH RESULT IN ANTI-FREEZE LEAKING INTO THE ENGINE CAUSING BAD CAMSHAFTS, BAD BEARINGS AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE. IF I HAD THE RESOURCES TO DUMP THE PIECE OF JUNK I JUST MIGHT, HOWEVER I DO NOT HAVE THE RECOURSES TO DO THAT, I MUST GET IT FIXED. RIGHT NOW A $4000.00 DOLLAR REPAIR WILL NOT BE GOOD FOR MY FAMILY. FRANKLY I AM TIRED OF BEING SOLD JUNK, 20000.00 DOLLARS MIGHT NOT BE MUCH TOO SOME PEOPLE BUT IT IS TO ME.

I WAS ABLE TO BACK UP AND THE STEERING WHEEL WAS LOCKED. UPON EXAMINATION BY THE GARAGE ON BASE, THE MECHANIC SAID THAT THE STEERING GEAR AND PINION  HAD FAILED AND THAT IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED. I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING WITH GENERAL MOTORS FOR OVER 2 MONTHS NOW TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT 2 SEPERATE MECHANICS HAVE TOLD THEM, THAT THE STEERING GEAR IS BAD AND THAT THE FAILURE SHOULD NOT HAVE OCCURED. THEY BOTH SAID THAT HAD THE FAILURE OCCURED WHILE TRAVELING AT A HIGHER RATE OF SPEED, THE CRASH WOULD HAVE BEEN FATAL AT THE EXPENSE OF ME AND MY WIFE AND 2 CHILDREN. GM OVERSEAS KEEPS TRYING TO SAY THAT THE MILEAGE IS TOO HIGH AND THAT IT IS NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR. I GUESS TO THEM IT IS NORMAL TO CRASH YOUR CAR. THEIR TECHNICAL DEPT ALSO SAYS THAT I SHOULD HAVE NOTICED A GRADUAL LOOSEING OF THE STEERING. I DID NOT, IT HAPPENED SUDDENLY AND AS THE MECHANICS TOLD GM, THIS IS NO FAULT OF THE CUSTOMER! I CANNOT GET GM TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS PROBLEM, WHICH I GUESS IS WHY IT IS STILL SITTING AT THE GM DEALERSHIP(SCHWARZKOPF) IN AMBERG GERMANY. IT HAS BEEN SITTING THERE FOR OVER A MONTH AND BEFORE THAT A MONTH AT THE GARAGE ON BASE, 2 MONTHS WITHOUT MY CAR. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WILL DO ANY GOOD TO WRITE THIS, BUT I GUESS THAT WHAT IT WILL TAKE IS FOR SOMEONE TO CRASH THEIR CAR BEFORE CHEVROLET ACKNOWLEDGES A PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING GEAR. THIS CAR HAS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED SINCE I BOUGHT IT NEW, SO MAINTENANCE IS NOT THE ISSUE HERE. I HOPE THAT SOMEONE CAN HELP ME WITH THIS MATTER.

IT SHOULD CLEAR UP AFTER THE METALS HAVE EXPANDED INSIDE THE ENGINE.  I GUESS YOU CAN CALL ME CONSCIECIOUS BUT THE WORD \"DEFECT\" HAS A TENDENCY TO UNNERVE A PERSON AFTER PAYING FOR A \"NEW\" CAR.

WEARING PARTS MEAN A UNPREDICIBLE SITUATION AND I WORRY FOR MY FAMILY'S SAFETY WHEN WE BOUGHT A NEW CAR TO HAVE PIECE OF MIND.  THIS TOLERANCE THING IS UNSAFE SINCE WRIST PINS ARE WHAT HOLD THE PISTONS ON THE CONNECTING RODS.  THERE CAN BE NO TOLERANCE GAP ON A PART AS IMPORTANT EVEN IF IT STOPS AFTER A WHILE.
