CHRYSLER WAS CONTACTED AND TOLD US THEY WILL DO NOTHING BECAUSE IT WAS PAST THEIR WARRANTY.  WE HAD A SECOND TRANSMISSION INSTALLED IN THE CAR, IT FAILED AFTER 15300 MILES.  THIS FAILURE ALSO OCCURED ON THE HIGHWAY, LUCKILY AT A MUCH LOWER RATE OF SPEED WHILE ON THE ON RAMP.  WE HAVE TALKED TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR TRANSMISSION FAIL ON THEM ON THE SAME PLATFORM OF CAR AND ALSO, YOUR (NHTSA) DATABASE SHOWS NUMEROUS PROBLEMS/FAILURES WITH THE SAME EXACT PLATFORM TRANSMISSION AT MUCH LOWER MILEAGES.  JUST FOR A NOTE, THERE ARE SEVERAL MAJOR SYSTEM PROBLEMS AS POINTED OUT BY YOUR DATABASE AND OTHER SOURCES.  THESE INCLUDE AIR CONDITIONIN SYSTEM, FUEL RAIL SYSTEM, STRUT SYSTEM, TRANSMISSION SYSTEM, CONTROLL ARM SYSTEM AND AIRBAG SYSTEM.
