I THEN CALLED FORD BACK AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT THEY COULD DO FOR ME SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS PAST 7 YEARS. SO, NOW I HAVE AN UN-USEABLE UN-SELLABLE VEHICLE.

MANAGED TO GET MY 4X4 TRUCK OUT OF CENTER LANE AND INTO EMERGENCY LANE WITHOUT BEING HIT. TRIED RESTARTING ENGINE A COUPLE OF TIMES, WHICH IT DID, BUT I SHUT IT DOWN IMMEDIATELY BOTH TIMES BECAUSE OF SEVERE VIBRATION AND NOISE. AFTER ARRANGING FOR EMERGENCY ROAD SERVICE AND A POLICE OFFICER TO PROTECT MY BACKSIDE FROM TRAFFIC APPROACHING FROM THE REAR, THE TRUCK WAS TOWED TO MY FORD DEALERSHIP OF 12 YEARS. I HAD PURCHASED MY TRUCK THERE NEW AND DID ALL MY MAINTENANCE THERE, EXCEPT MAYBE A COUPLE OF OIL CHANGES WHEN I HAVE BEEN OUT OF STATE. THERE THE TRUCK WAS DIAGNOSED TO HAVE CAM PHASER FAILURE AND NEEDED A 5,000+ ENGINE REPLACEMENT @ 130,000 MILES. UNBELIEVABLE. I'VE HAD THE CRACKED WINDSHIELD, THE REAR SEAL ISSUES, THE VARIOUS ELECTRONIC FAILURES AND YES, THE FORD SPARK PLUG ISSUE WITH BROKEN PLUGS DURING A MAINTENANCE CHANGE. I STILL LOVED MY TRUCK UNTIL IT NEARLY CAUSED MY FAMILY AND I SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH, OR POSSIBLY SOME OTHER UNDESERVING SOUL. I'M NOT REPLACING THE ENGINE AND AM TRYING TO EXTRACT WHATEVER REMAINING VALUE EXISTS. THE DEALERSHIP HAS BEEN INDIFFERENT TO THE SITUATION AND HAS DONE LITTLE.

HE WAS UNABLE, AS SOME OF THE TIRE TREAD WAS WRAPPED AROUND THE AXLE.  WE ALSO OBSERVED THE PARKING BRAKE CABLE BROKEN.  A TOW TRUCK WAS THEN DISPATCHED TO MOVE MY F-150 TO A GARAGE.    DAMAGE NOTED TO THE TRUCK WAS A SNAPPED PARKING BRAKE CABLE AND A KINKED HYDRAULIC LINE.  I AUTHORIZED THE GARAGE TO REPAIR THE BRAKE SYSTEM AND GET MY TRUCK BACK ON THE ROAD.  BY THE TIME THEY WERE ABLE TO GATHER THE REPAIR PARTS, IT WAS THE FOLLOWING WEDNESDAY (DAY BEFORE THANKSGIVING) WHEN I ABLE TO GET IT BACK.      FIRST THING I NOTICED WAS THE BROKEN TRAILER ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR ON THE BUMPER.  DISCUSSIONS WITH THE TOW COMPANY AND THE GARAGE DETERMINED THAT THE DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY FLYING RUBBER.      THAT WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON I TOOK THE TRUCK TO DISCOUNT TIRE TO HAVE THE DAMAGED TIRE REPLACED UNDER THE ROAD HAZARD WARRANTY I HAD PURCHASED FROM THEM.  EXAMINATION OF THE REMAINING THREE LTX M/S TIRES REVEALED ANOTHER TIRE WITH A DELAMINATION BULGE.  DISCOUNT REPLACED TWO OF THE TIRES UNDER THE WARRANTY WITH LTX M/S2?S, AND I PURCHASED TWO MORE.

I DID NOT INSPECT THE REGULATOR TO DETERMINE WHY THE CABLE MECHANISM HAD FAILED.  AFTER THIS INCIDENT I VISITED WWW.NHTSA.GOV TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM, AND LEARNED THAT MORE THAN 240 OTHER 2004 FORD TRUCK OWNERS HAD EXPERIENCED THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM IN ONE DOOR OR THE OTHER IN THEIR TRUCKS. AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED WHEN INFERIOR PARTS ARE INSTALLED IN A VEHICLE, SUCH AS THE WINDOW REGULATORS IN THE 2004 FORD TRUCKS, THE PASSENGER-SIDE WINDOW REGULATOR ALSO FAILED.

I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP LAST WEEK DUE TO THE WINDOW MOTOR SEIZING/BREAKING. I PAID FOR THE SERVICE TO REPAIR THAT ISSUE, WHICH IS ANOTHER PROBLEM AS WELL.

THE PLUGS BECOME FUSED TO THE ENGINE BLOCK AT 100,000 MILES, AND I AM NOW AT 105,000 AND JUST FINDING OUT ABOUT THIS! THE PROBLEM THAT I AM EXPERIENCING IS THAT THE DEALERSHIP WANTS TO CHARGE AN ABSORBENT AMOUNT OF MONEY TO CHANGE THE SPARK PLUGS, AND IF ANY BREAK, ITS AN EXTRA $100 TO REMOVE EACH BROKEN PLUG. THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE AN ADDITIONAL $800 EXTRA TO CHANGE THE SPARK PLUGS. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY LUDICROUS FOR FORD TO CHARGE AN OWNER FOR SUCH A TASK! ALSO IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE DEALERSHIP THAT I PURCHASED THE TRUCK FROM OBVIOUSLY KNEW ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND NEGLECTED TO INFORM ME IN ANY FASHION. I AM CONSIDERING TAKING LEGAL ACTION AS I BELIEVE THE DEALER SHOULD BE LIABLE TO COVER THE COST OF THIS TASK, AS THEY DID NOT DISCLOSE THESE PROBLEMS THAT ACCORDING TO THE DEALER HAD TO BE ADDRESSED WITHIN 10,000 ADDITIONAL MILES. THAT IS A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF MILES TO DRIVE FOR SUCH A MAJOR EXPENDITURE.

IT WAS SUCH A STRANGE SOUND, WE ASKED TWO OTHER FORD DEALERSHIP AND THEY STATED THE SAME THING, BUT THEY NEVER LOOKED INTO IT.  ONE MORNING IN OCTOBER, MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING TO WORK AND THE TRUCK STARTED SHAKING SEVERELY.  IT WAS SO BAD HE HAD DIFFICULTY CONTROLLING THE VEHICLE.  IF IT WASN'T ON A BACK ROAD, WE KNOW HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT.  WE TOOK IT TO COURT STREET FORD AND THEY SAID THEY HAD TO RUN DIAGNOSTICS ON IT.  THEY RECEIVED A CODE OF 340, BUT COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG.   THE FORD DEALERSHIP BROUGHT FORD ENGINEERS IN TO HELP IDENTIFY WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE. PER THE ENGINEERS?? SUGGESTION, THE MECHANIC WOULD ASK FOR PERMISSION TO RUN A TEST.  EACH TIME, WE WERE TOLD, THIS TEST WILL TELL US IF IT IS THIS REPAIR OR THAT.  AFTER 2  WEEKS AND ALMOST $700 IN TESTS, IMAGINE OUR SURPRISE AT THE FINAL DIAGNOSIS \"CATASTROPHIC ENGINE FAILURE\" DUE TO CLOGGED OIL PASSAGES.

AS I TRIED TO ROLL THE WINDOW UP, I REALIZED IT WAS THE WINDOW THAT MADE THE POP BECAUSE THE WINDOW QUICKLY FELL THE REST OF THE WAY INTO THE TRUCK.

AFTER RESEARCH ONLINE (AND TALKING TO FORD DEALERS) FOUND OUT IT WAS THE WINDOW REGULATOR AND QUITE COMMON IN 2004 FORD F150 LARIATS.  I FEEL THIS SHOULD DEFINITELY BE A RECALL BECAUSE IT COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS IF THIS HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY GOING 65 - 70 MPH!   09/27/10 (63500 MILES) - DRIVING IN TOWN THE REAR DRIVER SIDE WINDOW JUST FELL DOWN INTO THE WINDOW.  NO FORD DEALER IN OUR TOWN WE HAD TO DRIVE 45 MINUTES IN THE COLD OF OCTOBER WITH A PIECE OF CARDBOARD IN THE WINDOW (THAT KEPT MOVING AND CAUSING THE WINDOW TO CONTINUOUSLY FALL INTO THE TRUCK AND HAVING TO MAKE MANY STOPS ALONG THE WAY).  SAME ISSUE - WINDOW REGULATOR HAD TO BE REPLACED.  04/10/11 (69000 MILES) - DRIVING HOME FROM CHURCH IN TOWN THE WINDOW STARTED TO FALL INTO THE TRUCK.  AS THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED, WE ARE 100% SURE IT IS THE WINDOW REGULATOR!  SETTING UP AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE FORD DEALER TO GET IT FIXED.  RESEARCHED ONLINE, AND THIS HAS HAPPENED TO MANY OTHER 2004 FORD F150 LARIAT TRUCK OWNERS!

THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A LOCAL REPAIR SHOP WHERE THE LICENSED MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT MY EMERGENCY BRAKE SYSTEM HAD ESSENTIALLY FELL APART (EXPLODED) AND THAT ALL THE LOOSE PARTS FLOATING AROUND IN THE WHEEL HAD JAMMED THE WHEEL. HE CLAIMS THAT FORD USED CHEAP PARTS IN THE EMERGENCY BRAKE SYSTEMS AS PEOPLE WHO HAVE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS RARELY USE THEM.  MY VEHICLE IS A MANUAL TRANSMISSION SO THE EMERGENCY BRAKE IS A NECESSITY. I ASKED HIM IF THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I WERE DRIVING DOWN THE INTERSTATE AT 70 MPH AND HE RESPONDED \"ABSOLUTELY\". WHICH MEANS I COULD HAVE LOST CONTROL OF MY VEHICLE AND POSSIBLY FLIPPED. HE AND MY HUSBAND INFORMED ME THAT EVEN WITH ANY POSSIBLE WEAR, THESE PARTS SHOULD NOT BREAK.

HE WAS ABLE TO GET THE PARTS OUT OF THE CYLINDER HEAD, BUT DID NOTICE THE BOTTOM OF THE SPARK PLUG WAS BENT BACKWARDS. THEY USED AN ENGINE SCOPE TO INSPECT THE DAMAGE AND THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE DAMAGE TO THE PISTON HEAD ABOUT THE SIZE OF A QUARTER.

I GOT THE TRUCK BACK TO MY GIRLFRIENDS HOME IN NORTHEAST GA. AND THIS IS WHERE I'M STILL AT. THE DEALER I CALLED TOLD ME THAT THE PLUG WAS AT FAULT BEFORE I COULD EVEN FINISH TELLING HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND THAT IT WOULD COST ME ABOUT $2,800.00 TO REPLACE THE HEAD ON THAT SIDE... I ASKED HIM \"IF IT WAS THE PLUG AT FAULT AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN THE TRUCK YET, HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE A REPLACEMENT HEAD AND THE COST OF IT\"? HE PUT ME ON HOLD AND AFTER 20 MINUTES I HUNG UP AND CALLED BACK AND NO ONE WOULD TALK TO ME ABOUT IT..!! SINCE THEN, I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS AND FOUND THAT NOT ONLY HAS IT HAPPENED TO OTHERS, BUT IT HAS HAPPENED TO ALOT OF OTHERS...!! I HAVE ALSO FOUND THAT THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN REPORTED TO YOUR AGENCY MANY TIMES AND TO DATE, NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE ABOUT IT. WHEN THIS PLUG BLOW OUT OF THE HEAD, FUEL WAS BEING PUSHED OUT OF THE HEAD AND COULD HAVE CAUSED A FIRE UNDER THE HOOD. AT SPEEDS ON INTERSTATES AS HIGH AS THEY ARE, MY GIRLFRIEND, MYSELF AND OUT 2 DOGS COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED..!!!! SO WHY IS YOUR AGENCY NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM...!!!?????!!!!",

THE PART OF THE WINDOW THAT SECURES GLASS IS A COMBINATION OF METAL AND PLASTIC THE PLASTIC PIECE SECURES THE CABLES THAT ARE ATTACHED TO THE POWER WINDOW MOTOR. THESE PLASTIC PIECES ARE UNDER TOO MUCH STRESS AND THEN EITHER BEGIN CRACKING OR BREAK ALTOGETHER. THIS CAUSES THE CABLE TO BE UNSECURED THUS CAUSING THE WINDOW GLASS TO NO LONGER HAVE SUPPORT. THERE ARE ONE OF TWO EASY FIXES FOR THIS PROBLEM THAT I CAN SEE,OR MAYBE THREE.THE FIRST IS TO REDESIGN THE PART WITHOUT THE USE OF PLASTIC. NUMBER TWO IS TO OFFER THIS PARTICULAR PIECE SEPARATE BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY CAN BE REMOVE WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM FROM THE WINDOW TRACKS AND OFFER IT AS AN ALTERNATIVE REPAIR PART FOR THOSE WHO ARE MECHANICALLY INCLINED TO REPAIR IT THEMSELVES,OR HAVE A RECALL ON THESE REGULATORS. I BELIEVE IF A RECALL WAS OFFERED ON THESE REGULATORS THE FIX WOULD BE THE REMOVABLE ALTERNATIVE PART. TOO KEEP FROM HAVING CONTINUING RECALLS THE PART SHOULD BE ALL METAL OR UPGRADE THE PLASTIC SOMEHOW ALTHOUGH ALL METAL WOULD BE BETTER. IF A RECALL IS OFFERED ,DEALERS WILL WANT THE SMALL REMOVABLE PART AS THE FIX I'M ALMOST SURE OF. IN THE MEAN TIME I WILL HAVE TO SEARCH FOR THE COMPLETE REGULATOR WITH OR WITHOUT MOTOR WHICH IS BECOMING DIFFICULT BECAUSE MOST PARTS COMPANIES WANT TO SELL THE  COMPLETE ASSEMBLY OR IN MY CASE DON'T OFFER THE REAR WINDOW REGULATOR WHICH FORCES US TOO HAVE TO GO TOO FORD AND PAY IN EXCESS OF 200 DOLLARS FOR THE PART AND LABOR FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT MECHANICALLY INCLINED. ANYWAY IF DOOR GLASS IS FALLING AND SHATTERING THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND BECAUSE THIS CAN HAPPEN IN EXTREME WEATHER. ALSO THE VEHICLE CANNOT BE SECURED CAUSING THEFT TO RISE AND THUS INSURANCE RATES TOO RISE ALSO. TELL FORD TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THANK YOU FOR THIS LINK. *TR",

I FOUND A USED ENGINE WITH 15,000 MILE AND HAD IT INSTALLED.(IT WAS CHEAPER THAN REBUILDING THE OLD ONE)WHEN THE ENGINE WAS REMOVED WE FOUND PARTS OF THE PLUG THAT WAS TWISTED OFF HAD FELL ON THE VALVE SPRING AND BROKEN IT. I HAVE E-MAILED FORD AND MADE NUMEROUS CALLS TO THEM ,THEY HAVE NEVER RESPONDED IN ANY WAY.ON THE ENGINE THAT WAS INSTALLED,AFTER 52000 MILES I DEVELOPED A MISS IN THIS ENGINE,I TOOK IT TO ANOTHER FORD DEALER,THEY REPLACED THREE (3) PLUGS ,IT TOOK THEM THREE& HALF DAYS TO DO THIS AT A COST OF $360.00.

I TOOK THE DOOR APART AND INSPECTED THE REGULATOR AND THE ENTIRE CABLE MECHANISM HAD SEPARATED IN 3 PLACES.  THE CONNECTION TO THE MOTOR ALONG WITH TWO OTHER CONNECTIONS.  THE ONLY FIX IS WINDOW REGULATOR REPLACEMENT.  I ORDERED A REPLACEMENT REGULATOR FROM A LOCAL AUTO PARTS STORE. WHEN I COMPARED THE NEW ONE TO THE ORIGINAL I OBSERVED A MAJOR DIFFERENCE.  THE NEW ONE HAD COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF LUBRICANT ON THE GUIDES, CABLES AND PULLEYS.  THE ORIGINAL REGULATOR MECHANISM WAS COMPLETELY DRY WITH NO EVIDENCE OF ANY TYPE OF LUBRICATION.  WAS THE LACK OF LUBRICATION A FACTOR IN THE FAILURE?  I AM NOT SURE.  BUT, I DID FIND EVIDENCE OF METAL ON METAL.      I PLAN ON REPAIRING THE PROBLEM MYSELF WITH AN AFTERMARKET OEM PART.  THIS IS DUE TO THE NUMEROUS REPEATED FAILURES OF FORD WINDOW REGULATORS THAT HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED ONLINE.    THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE!

HOW IN THE HELL DO I KEEP MY WINDOW UP AND LOCK MY TRUCK WHILE I'M SHOPPING FOR GROCERIES OR SOMETHING? NOT ONLY COULD SOMEONE STEAL SOMETHING INSIDE BUT THEY COULD STEAL MY TRUCK! IF THIS ISN'T A SECURITY ISSUE THEN WHY DO I HAVE REMOTE LOCKS/ALARM? SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS! I DON'T HAVE $400 TO THROW AWAY IN THIS ECONOMY! *TR",

A SHORT TIME LATER OUR SECOND WINDOW ASSEMBLY REGULATOR BROKE AND THEY ONLY ASKED US TO PAY 20% OF THE REPAIR BILL EQUALING $55. 9 MONTHS LATER OUR THIRD WINDOW REGULATOR ASSEMBLY BROKE. WHEN THESE WINDOWS REGULATORS BREAK IT IS DURING RANDOM TIMES AND WHILE DRIVING. NO ONE IS ROLLING THE WINDOWS DOWN THEY JUST ALL OF A SUDDEN FALL DOWN. WE WERE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AT 65 MPH AND I HAD MY 12 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER SITTING NEXT TO THE WINDOW THAT BROKE AND SHE HAD HER HAND ON THE DOOR NEXT TO THE WINDOW. SHE ONLY HAD A SMALL RED MARK ON HER FINGER HOWEVER SHE WAS CRYING HYSTERICALLY BECAUSE IT SCARED HER. WHILE LOOKING ONLINE I HAVE FOUND THOUSANDS OF OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE WINDOW REGULATORS BREAKING ON THESE TRUCKS. WHEN WE CALLED TO GET THE TRUCK REPAIRED THE HAD THE PART IN STOCK AND WITHIN US MAKING A DECISION OF WHEN TO BRING THE TRUCK IN AN HOUR AND A HALF LATER THE PART WAS ALREADY USED. THE REPAIR TECH SAID THAT IT IS THEIR MOST COMMON PROBLEM. I FEEL THAT THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE. IF MY DAUGHTERS HAND HAD BEEN ANY CLOSER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SEVERELY PINCHED. WHAT IF THE WINDOW WERE TO SHATTER WHILE GOING DOWN ON THE FREEWAY AT THOSE SPEEDS?

THE NEXT NIGHT MY DRIVER SIDE WINDOW FELL INTO MY DOOR WHILE OUT DRIVING AND SCARED ME SO BAD IT MADE ME SWERVE OFF THE ROAD. A POLICE OFFICER SAW THIS AND ACCUSED ME OF BEING INTOXICATED SO I THEREFORE HAD TO GO THROUGH A FIELD SOBRIETY AND BREATHALIZER TEST. THE POLICE OFFICER APOLOGIZED BUT IT WAS VERY NERVE RACKING TO GO THROUGH THAT. THAT NIGHT I TOOK MY DOOR APART TO FIND A JUNGLE OF WIRES IN MY DOOR THAT ONCE CONNECTED TO THE TRACKS THAT HELD MY WINDOW IN PLACE. IT IS NOT REPAIRABLE, BUT REPLACEABLE SO THEREFORE I AM VERY UPSET. I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON CARS SINCE I WAS FOURTEEN YEAR OLD, AND NEVER HAVE I SEEN SUCH A HORRIBLE IDEA FOR A WINDOW MOTOR. THIS SHOULD BE RECALLED IMMEDIATELY AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. I AM VERY THANKFUL THAT I COMMUTED ON BACK COUNTRY ROADS THIS NIGHT BECAUSE IF I WERE TO BE ON THE INTERSTATE OR A HIGHWAY, THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT I WOULD HAVE WRECKED AND BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT OR EVEN KILLED. THE NOISE WAS SO LOUD AND QUICK IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREPARE FOR IT AND AFTER REVIEWING THE DESIGN OF THESE WINDOW MOTORS, REGULATORS, AND ELEVATOR CABLES, IT SEEMS AS IF FAILURE IS INEVITABLE AND IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY BREAK.

SO, WHEN THE WINDOW POPS AND YOU CAN'T ROLL THE THING UP I'D SAY THERE'S A SAFETY ISSUE. DRIVING IN THE RAIN WITH A MAKE SHIFT GARBAGE BAG WINDOW ISN'T SO SAFE EITHER. MY AFTERMARKET WARRANTY PAID FOR THE FIX THE FIRST TWO TIMES, BUT A HAVEN'T HAD THE PLEASURE OF INFORMING THEM THAT IT'S HAPPENED FOR A THIRD TIME IN TWO YEARS. I'LL BE SURE TO MENTION THE WEBSITE COMPLAINTS TO THEM AS WELL. I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF ANGRY FORD TRUCK OWNERS OUT THERE THAT WOULD APPRECIATE IF THIS SAFETY ISSUE WAS TAKEN SERIOUSLY. I KNOW THAT FORD HAS BIGGER PROBLEMS RIGHT NOW, BUT WITH THE AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS I'VE SEEN ABOUT THIS ISSUE THERE SHOULD BE SOME INQUIRY TO A SAFETY RECALL. *TR",

REPAIRED FOR ANOTHER 100 DOLLARS UNDER WARRANTY. THIS TIME WINDOW BROKE WHILE THE TRUCK WAS PARKED IN THE DRIVEWAY. I FEAR THE OTHER 2 WINDOWS WILL BREAK NOW. I AM SURPRISED THE GLASS HAS NOT SHATTERED AND HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE THAT I WAS NOT ON THE FREEWAY DURING EITHER INCIDENT. IT MAKES A VERY LOUD SOUND WHEN IT BREAKS. SERVICE GUY AT FORD SUGGESTED I CALL FORD CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. SPOKE WITH REP AND SHE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO RECORD OF THIS HAPPENING TO ANYONE ELSE YET THE DISCUSSION BOARDS ON THE WEB ARE FULL OF 2004 FORD TRUCK OWNERS WITH THE SAME ISSUE. I HAVE OWNED FORDS FOR THE LAST 25 YEARS AND HAVE BEEN HAPPY WITH THE QUALITY. BUT SOMETHING IS OBVIOUSLY WRONG WITH THE DESIGN OR THE MATERIALS ON THE WINDOW MECHANISM. IT'S A $45,000 TRUCK, 84,000 MILES AND I TAKE PERFECT CARE OF IT.

WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO CRACK THE WINDOW FOR AIR CIRCULATION, I HEARD A LOUD BANG AND THE WINDOW FELL ALL THE WAY INTO THE DOOR CAUSING ME TO SWERVE AND NEARLY MISS A VEHICLE IN THE NEXT LANE. THE FAILURE ALSO SOAKED THE INTERIOR OF THE TRUCK AND MANY ITEMS IN THE FRONT SEAT. I HAD TO CONTINUE DRIVING IN THE RAIN FOR SEVERAL MILES TO A GAS STATION FOR A PLASTIC BAG BECAUSE THE DOOR PANEL HAD TO BE REMOVED TO GET THE WINDOW BACK UP. THE RT REAR WAS NEXT FOLLOWED BY THE LT REAR WINDOWS. EACH WINDOW FAILED WITH A LOUD BANK AND SLID INTO THE DOOR WHILE ATTEMPTING TO ROLL DOWN THE WINDOW. ALL 3 WINDOWS ARE BEING HELD IN THE UP POSITION BY WEDGING SCREW DRIVERS BETWEEN THE DOOR AND WINDOW. 3 WINDOWS IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS!

AS A RETIRED ENGINEER FROM ANOTHER MANUFACTURER AND ALSO HAVING WORKED FOR THE OTHER OF THE BIG THREE, I KNOW THAT WELDING DESTROYS THE RUST PREVENTABLE ON THE SHEET METAL.

BUBBLES APPEAR UNDER WHAT LOOKS LIKE GOOD SOLID PAINT AND THEN BREAKS THROUGH AND SHOWS RUSTED METAL.

I CANNOT AFFORD THIS ON A MONTHLY BASIS NOR SHOULD I OR ANYONE ELSE NEED TO PUT UP WITH THE OBVIOUS DEFECT WITH FORDS WINDOW REGULATORS.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  *TR",

AFTER THE FIRST FEW MONTHS I NOTICED A GRINDING SOUND UNDER THE TRUCK THAT SOUNDED LIKE A FEW BALL BEARINGS ROLLING AROUND QUICKLY IN A METAL BOWL.  IT WOULD LAST ABOUT 5-10 SECONDS AND THEN I WOULD NOT HEAR AGAIN FOR A FEW MONTHS.  AFTER ABOUT THE 5TH TIME THIS HAPPENED I TOOK  VEHICLE  TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP, AND THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM, SO NOTHING WAS DONE.  THE NEXT TIME THIS NOISE  WAS HEARD I QUICKLY TURNED ON THE 4X4 HIGH VIA THE SWITCH ON THE DASHBOARD  AND THE NOISE WENT AWAY IMMEDIATELY. I COULD DO THIS EVERY TIME AFTER.  THIS WAS TELLING ME IT WAS SOMEWHERE IN THE TRANSFER CASE.  SO, LAST WEEK AROUND 60000 MILES  THE TRANSMISSION STARTED GRINDING IN TRAFFIC, SLIPPING, AND GIVING ME A TRANSMISSION  FAIL INDICATION WHERE THE ODOMETER  WAS LOCATED , AND A FLASHING OVERDRIVE OFF.  THIS HAPPENED FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES  UNTIL I COULD GET OFF THE EXPRESSWAY, AND EXIT INTO A GAS STATION PARKING LOT.  I THOUGHT FOR SURE THE TRANSMISSION  WAS GOING TO BLOW OUT  AT ANY MOMENT.  I TURNED OFF THE TRUCK, WHICH RESET THE TRANSMISSION  FAIL ALARM, PUT THE TRUCK IN REVERSE, WHICH MADE A LOUD SLAMMING NOISE.  I THEN PUT IT IN DRIVE AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE HOME WITH ONLY GRINDING NOISE IN FIRST GEAR.  I WAITED 2 DAYS ,AND THEN DROVE THE TRUCK TO THE DEALERSHIP 40 MINUTES AWAY WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS .  AFTER A DAY IN THE S REPAIR SHOP THEY PULLED THE PAN AND IT HAD METAL SHAVINGS EVERYWHERE.  THEY CALLED AND TOLD ME THEY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE TO THE REPAIR SHOP.  THEY FOUND SOME BAD SEALS AND A VACUUM PUMP/SOLENOID IN THE TRANSFER CASE, THE TRANSMISSION  WAS GONE AND WAS COMPLETELY REPLACED.  ALL THE SOFTWARE HAS BEEN UPDATED, WHICH I HAVE HEARD CAN CAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE PROBLEMS. IT WOULD HAVE COST ME AROUND $6000 IF I DIDN'T  PURCHASE THE COMPLETE WARRANTY.*AK",

I HIT THE STAIRCASE AT A TREMENDOUS RATE OF SPEED YET THE AIRBAGS DIDN''T DEPLOY.    THE CAR THAT HIT ME WAS TOTALED AND THE DRIVER WENT TO THE HOSPITAL. MY DAUGHTER''S TRUCK WAS TOTALED AND I HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL WITH INJURIES THAT TURNED OUT TO BE BRUISES ALL OVER MY BODY, ESPECIALLY ON MY LEGS. THE STAIRCASE WAS DESTROYED AND A CAR NEARBY HAD DAMAGE. THE INSURANCE WAS NOT ADEQUATE TO COVER ALL THE DAMAGE. THE INSURANCE COMPANY SENT SOMEONE OUT TO DO AN ENGINEERING REPORT ON THE TRUCK BUT HE COULD NOT FIND THE CAUSE. THAT DIDN''T SURPRISE ME AS THERE WAS LITTLE LEFT TO INSPECT.    THIS WAS DEFINITELY A MECHANICAL FAILURE. I DID NOT HAVE MY FOOT ON THE GAS PEDDLE. I WAS TRYING TO STOP THE TRUCK WITH THE BRAKES AND STEERING TO AVOID PEOPLE AND OTHER OBSTACLES.    FORD NEEDS TO LOOK INTO THIS AS IT IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS FLAW OR DEFECT. I AM GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF MONEY TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE THAT THE INSURANCE DIDN''T PAY.",

WHEN THE TRUCK WAS AT 35000 THE DRIVER WINDOW FELL INTO THE DOOR, I LIVE IN THE HOTTEST CITY IN AZ.  THE DEALER WAS HAPPY TO FIX THE PROBLEM, BUT THE PARTS WERE ON BACK ORDER, BECAUSE THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR THIS YEAR TRUCK.  THAT IS WHAT THE DEALER TOLD ME!  THE SOLUTION MEAN WHILE, A PAIR OF VISEGRIPS ON THE WINDOW FRAME RAIL, THAT ACTUALLY WORK GREAT EVEN THOUGH I HAD TO DO IT MYSELF.  THEY DID FIX THE WINDOW UNDER WARRANTY, BUT A WEEK LATER THE PASSENGER WINDOW HIT THE FLOOR TOO.  LUCKILY STILL UNDER WARRANTY, BUT WHILE TAKING THE TRUCK IN FOR THE PASSENGER WINDOW THE BACKSLIDER QUIT WORKING SO THEY FIXED IT AS WELL. 3 DOWN 2 TO GO!  TWO WEEKS LATER THE DRIVER REAR WINDOW MAKES A POPPING SOUND AND WENT INTO THE DOOR.  #4 AND WOULD YOU GUESS 14 MILES OUT OF WARRANTY, $388 LATER WINDOW IS FINE.  ONE WEEK TO THE DAY DRIVING TO PHOENIX AZ. A SLIGHT BITE COOLER THEN WE ARE, THE PASSENGER REAR WINDOW POPPED AND SLOWLY WENT DOWN. AFTER AN HOUR IN A WAL-MART PARKING LOT I GOT THE WINDOW CLAMPED UP. THE DEALER TOLD ME TO WAIT FOR A RECALL AND I WILL BE PAID FOR THE TWO WINDOWS AT $388 A POP.  I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT IT IS A DESIGN CHANGE TO THE REGULATOR IN THE WINDOW.  A PLASTIC CLIP IS USED ON THE CABLE THAT PULLS THE WINDOW UP/DOWN.  MY OTHER QUESTION IS DO THEY REPLACE THE REGULATOR WITH THE SAME TYPE AND IF SO WHEN WILL IT BREAK AGAIN.  *NM",

THE POLE STRUCK THE PASSENGER-SIDE DOOR, EFFECTIVELY CAVING IT IN AND CAUSING THE INJURIES.        DAYS LATER I INSPECTED THE VEHICLE.

I WORKED W/REESE CUSTOMER SERVICE BY TRYING THEIR DIFFERENT SUGGESTIONS, TO NO AVAIL.  I HAPPEN TO ALSO WORK FOR A FORD DEALER SO I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY DURING A LUNCH BREAK TO RAISE MY TRUCK UP ON A LIFT TO BE SURE THAT ALL THE MOUNTING BOLTS WERE THERE AND THAT THEY WERE TIGHT.  WHAT I FOUND STARTLED ME.  THE 2\" RECEIVER TUBE ON THE HITCH HAD SPLIT ABOUT 1 1/2\" IN THE LOWER RIGHT CORNER, TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK.  IT WAS ABOUT 1/8\" AT IT'S WIDEST POINT.

HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE HAD BEEN SIMILAR OCCURRENCES THAT HE HAD WITNESSED,EVEN THOUGH WHEN I CALLED THE FORD ENGINEERS IN MICHIGAN,THEY CLAIMED TO HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THEM.  INCIDENTALLY,THE FORD ENGINEERS ALSO TOLD ME THAT THEY BELIEVED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS MOST LIKELY A FAULTY HITCH,AND THAT THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT EXCESSIVE TONGUE WAS THE PROBLEM.

ONLY THE BOTTOM AND THE SIDES WERE ACCESSIBLE AND AFTER ONLY A FEW MORE TRIPS,THE TOP OF THE RECEIVER TUBE WAS OPENING BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE REINFORCEMENTS WORKED.

WHEN THE REAR DOOR IS AJAR THE FRONT DOOR WILL LATCH TO THE REAR DOOR, WHICH SATISFIES THE DOOR AJAR SAFETY LIGHT, BUT THE FRONT AND REAR DOOR ARE NOT SAFELY LATCHED.  I AM A LARGE MAN SO MY SEAT IS AS FAR BACK AS IT COULD GO AND THE BACK IS SLIGHTLY RECLINED, WHEN I GET IN AND OUT OF THE VEHICLE MY SHOULDER HITS THE REAR DOOR HANDLE THAT PROTRUDES INTO THE DRIVERS SEAT AND AT TIMES WILL SLIGHTLY OPEN THE DOOR.  I WON'T REALIZE THAT I AM DRIVING WITH THE DOOR UNSAFELY LATCHED AND HAVE NO IDEA THAT THE DOOR IS AJAR UNTIL I HIT A BUMP LARGE ENOUGH TO RATTLE THE DOOR.  MY QUESTION IS, IS IT SAFE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE WITH THE FRONT AND REAR DOORS AJAR AND IN AN AHEAD ON COLLISION WILL THIS AREA BE COMPROMISED, THUS WOULD THE CRUMPLE ZONE BE AFFECTED DRASTICALLY AND WOULD THE STABILITY OF THE VEHICLE BE COMPROMISED? ALSO IS IT SAFE IN A SIDE COLLISION?  I FEEL THAT THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY.  I TOOK THE TRUCK IN FOR SERVICE AT FULLERTON FORD IN SOMERVILLE NJ THE SAID THAT FORD SAID THAT THIS IS NORMAL AND I CALLED FORD COMPANY THEY SAID THIS IS NORMAL AND THAT I HAD NO RECOURSE WITH THEM.  IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THIS WAS INHERENT TO THE F150 SUPER CAB I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THIS MODEL, I WAS TOLD THE F150 CREW CAB HAS THIS SAFETY DEVICE INSTALLED THUS THE SAFETY PROBLEM WAS ADDRESSED IN THIS MODEL BUT NOT THE SUPER CAB.

IT WAS NOT A CONSTANT THING WHEN WE WERE DRIVING THE TRUCK. HOWEVER AFTER A FEW OCCASIONS OVER A COUPLE MONTHS WE TOOK IT TO THE DEALER.WE TOOK IN ON FEB.1 2005. THE VEHICLE HAD 2600 MILES ON IT AT THIS TIME.THE DEALER CONCURRED WITH THE PROBLEM AND THE DEALER CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY FOR ASSISTANCE ON HOW TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.THE DEALER DID AS THEY WERE INSTRUCTED BY FORD AND DID CHECKS AND INSPECTIONS OF SEVERAL SYSTEMS. THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD IT RESOLVED.BUT A MONTH TO SIX WEEKS LATER IT BEGAN STALLING AGAIN.ONLY A COUPLE OF TIMES AT LOW SPEED.THEN SOME TIME PASTED IT DID IT AGAIN THEN A WEEK LATER IT SHUTTERED WHILE ENTERING TRAFFIC. THEN 3 DAYS LATER IT STALLED IN THE MIDDLE OF A THREE LANE EXPRESSWAY BLOCKING TRAFFIC FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR.IN THE PAST EVERYTIME IT STALLED IT WOULD RESTART. THIS TIME IT WOULD NOT CRANK OVER BUT IT HAD A HOT BATTERY.IT WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER THEY DIAGNOSED IT AS A BAD MIRCOPROCESSOR I BELIEVE. THIS WAS REPLACED ,IT DID NOT CURE THE PROBLEM.THE CURRENT MILEAGE ON THE VEHICLE IS 4700 MILES. MY SAFETY CONCERN IS THAT AS MANY TIMES AS THIS VEHICLE HAS STALLED I HAVE NOT BEEN HIT BY ANOTHER VEHICLE. BUT MY LUCK MAY RUN OUT. HAVE OTHERS HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS,HAVE THERE BEEN RECALLS IN THIS PROBLEM OR SERVICE BULLETINS. I EMAILED FORD AND IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THEY RECEIVED MY EMAIL BUT THEY DID NOT RESPOND FOR THE SECOND TIME.THE DEALER IS VERY UNDERSTANDING BUY IF FORD HAS DATA THAT WILL HELP THEY NEED TO CONVEY IT TO THE DEALER.I NEED A RESOLUTION AND AN ASSURANCE THAT THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED.ITS NO DIFFERENT FROM DRIVING A VEHICLE THAT THE STEERING MAY BREAK AT ANY TIME.WHEN IT STALLS I LOSES POWER BRAKES AND POWER STEERING PLUS THE DANGER OF APPROACHING TRAFFIC. *JS    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE A LEAK IN THE WINDSHIELD ANYWHERE, BUT THEN AGAIN, BASED ON ONE PERSON ON THE FORD TRUCK ENTHUSIASTS THREAD HAD THE PROBLEM FIXED AT A DEALER VIA A THIRD PARTY AUTO GLASS PERSON SEALING UP THE TOP OF THE WINDOW.

VERY ANNOYING, UNCOMFORTABLE TO DRIVE AND COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE FOR A BRAND NEW VEHICLE.  THE DEALERSHIP MISREPRESENTED THEMSELVES BY TELLING ME IT WAS A WHEEL BALANCE ISSUE.  NOW, FORD IS IN BREACH OF CONTRACT FOR NOT FIXING THE PROBLEM UNDER THE FACTORY WARRANTY.  I GAVE THEM A FAIR CHANCE TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND STAND BY THEIR WORD AND REPLACE THE VEHICLE WITH ONE THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE VIBRATION.  THEY DID NOT.  NOW I WANT THEM TO BUY THE VEHICLE BACK AND PAY ALL OF THE ASSOCIATED COSTS INVOLVED WITH DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE AND OWNERSHIP.*AK",

THE PURPOSE OF THIS LETTER IS TO ALERT YOU OF A POSSIBLE PROBLEM WITH HANKOOK TIRES.    I PURCHASED AND TOOK DELIVERY OF A 2004 F-150  VIN#[XXX] ON FEBRUARY 20, 2004. THIS VEHICLE CAME EQUIPPED WITH HANKOOK TIRES. YESTERDAY, APRIL, 31ST 2004 WHILE DRIVING THE RIGHT REAR TIRE SPLIT FROM THE RIM TO THE TREAD AFTER 5,000 MILES OF HIGHWAY DRIVING. I AM NOT AN EXPERT BUT I SEE NO SIDEWALL DAMAGE THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS FAILURE. I SUSPECT THIS IS SIMPLY A BADLY DEFECTIVE TIRE.    I HAVE STARTED THE PROCESS OF GETTING A NEW TIRE UNDER THE LIMITED WARRANTY OFFERED BY HANKOOK. I HAVE CONTACTED HANKOOKS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IN RANCHO CUCAMONGA, CALIFORNIA. I HAVE ALERTED MY LOCAL FORD DEALER, HERITAGE FORD IN LOVELAND, COLORADO BUT HANOOK HAS GIVEN ME A \u001cFORD HOTLINE NUMBER\u001d WHICH I WAS ADVISED TO PASS ON TO THE DEALER AS A FIRST STEP. I WILL DO THAT FIRST THING ON MONDAY MAY3RD.    IF FORD WOULD LIKE TO INSPECT THE TIRE PLEASE LET ME KNOW PROMPTLY.  I SUSPECT I WILL BE SENT TO A LOCAL HANKOOK TIRE DEALER FOR ADJUSTMENT AND THEY MOST LIKELY WILL KEEP THE DAMAGED TIRE.    REGARDS,    NO INJURY OR VEHICLE DAMAGE OCCURED. THE MANUFACTURER HAS REFUSED TO REPLACE THE TIRE SAYING THAT FAILURE INVOLVED A ROAD HAZARD. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT TO BE THE CASE. I HAVE THE TIRE AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO TURN IT OVER TO YOU FOR EXAMINATION.    [XXX].  *AK  *JS      INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",
