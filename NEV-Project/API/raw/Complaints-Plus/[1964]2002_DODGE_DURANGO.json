        "summary": "While pulling a travel trailer I got onto the freeway. As I have been pulling the trailer for a while now with this vehicle my comfort speed is around 45mph but will push up to 50mph maybe 55mph at the most. Anyways while entering the freeway I accelerated and as I got ready to merge I let my foot off the gas but the peddle stayed down and the vehicle continued to accelerate until around 80mph to 85mph when I finally got the peddle to release and stop acceleration. I quickly got off the freeway to calm myself as I was terrified I was going to crash. During this incident the first thing I did was tap the brakes lightly which did absolutely nothing and the car  kept accelerating next I grabbed the floor mat thinking that maybe it was obstructing the peddle, it was not. Then I quickly used my foot to wiggle under the peddle and pull up multiple times until it finally released and came up stopping acceleration and luckily to my relief I did not crash although I had come very close had there been any more traffic or if I had got going g any faster I may not have been so lucky. This only happened the one time where I got to dangerous speeds but since then the peddle has started to stick two other times but this times it was much easier to get the peddle to release and I wasn't towing a trailer. I read that this happened in another model in freezing temperatures fro. The same manufacturer but couldn't find anything to it without freezing temperatures. I think it is a manufacturer defect that maybe affects other 2002 Dodge Durango I dony know if pulling the trailer triggered this or not as I said it has happened twice since and that was without a trailer attached. Definitely scary and should be looked at.. I don't have the funds to take it to a shop so I haven't had it professionally looked at yet",

THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMPLAINT IS SO THAT OTHER DODGE DURANGO OWNERS AND THE NHTSA CAN SEE IF THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL AND FIND OUT IF ANY OTHER DRIVERS HAVE HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS.

I WENT TO A PARTS STORE TO HAVE THEM HOOK UP TO THE COMPUTER TO GET THE ERROR CODE--VACUUM LEAK AGAIN.  WHEN THE PARTS STORE GUY LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD TO GET THE RIGHT LENGTH OF HOSE TO GIVE ME(GOING TO CHANGE IT MYSELF AND NOT PAY TO HAVE IT FIXED), HE SAID IT HAD NOT EVEN BEEN REPLACED WITH VACUUM HOSE.  INSTEAD, ONE WAS REPLACED WITH FUEL LINE HOSE AND THE OTHER REPLACED WITH TRANMISSION HOSE.  THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM THAT I HAVE HAD AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER TO THEM.  IT ISN'T A SERIOUS PROBLEM, BUT IS STILL A PROBLEM.  IF THE HOSE IS DEGRADING THAT QUICKLY, IT MUST BE SUBMITTED TO HIGH TEMPERATURES WHICH COULD LEAD TO A BIG PROBLEM.  *NM",

YOUR GOVERNMENT BRANCH, THE DODGE MANUFACTURER AND OWNERS OF THIS TYPE VEHICLE ARE WELL AWARE THAT THIS IS A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT.
