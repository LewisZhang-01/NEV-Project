IT HAPPENED AS RECENTLY AS 2017 AND I AM BEGINNING TO BE AFRAID TO RIDE IN IT.  AT SPEEDS BETWEEN 40-70 MPH THE CAR BEGINS TO VIOLENTLY SHAKE FROM SIDE TO SIDE. IT GRADUALLY GETS WORSE.  REDUCING YOUR SPEED DOES HELP. IT APPEARS TO BEGIN BECAUSE OF A SMALL, UNEVEN PLACE IN THE HIGHWAY ROAD, BUT THEN DOESN'T STOP SHAKING BACK AND FORTH, SIDE TO SIDE.  IT HAS HAPPENED REPEATEDLY EVEN AFTER HAVING IT SUPPOSEDLY FIXED.  EACH TIME WE HAVE TAKEN IT TO BE REPAIRED THE SERVICE PERSONNEL ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS PROBLEM CALLLING IT A \"DEATH WOBBLE\" AND REPLACE THE STRUTS AND OTHER AFFECTED PARTS.  IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE. WE'VE DONE THIS 2-3 TIMES BUT AFTER A COUPLE YEARS IT HAPPENS AGAIN. CAN YOU PLEASE HELP OWNERS OF THE NISSAN PATHFINDER WITH THIS DEFECT?  IT'S EXTREMELY UNSAFE AND TERRIFIES BOTH DRIVER AND PASSENGERS.  PLEASE SEARCH ONLINE: 1998 NISSAN PATHFINDER DEATH WOBBLE AND YOU WILL READ HUNDREDS OF POSTS AND UTUBE VIDEOS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. PLEASE HELP US.",

THE FIRST INCIDENT OCCURRED ON MARCH 11,2003 (PLEASE SEE ODI NUMBER 10036981).IT IS MY OPINION THAT A VEHICLE MALFUNCTION CAUSED BOTH INCIDENTS.IT IS A FACT THAT REPAIRS ORDERED BY THE DEALER (BG FUEL INDUCTION SERVICE)  ON MARCH 12,2003 DID NOT ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. SECOND INCIDENT: ON AUG. 21,2003, AT APPROXIMATELY 8:00 AM, I DROVE THE PATHFINDER TO THE SECOND FLOOR OF MY SCHOOL PARKING GARAGE.THE PARKING SPACES ARE AT A RIGHT ANGLE TO THE BUILDING OUTSIDE WALL; THEREFORE, A DRIVER IS REQUIRED TO DESCRIBE A SMALL ARC TO PARK A VEHICLE WITHIN THE TWO BOUNDARY LINES PAINTED ON THE FLOOR.I USUALLY PARK AWAY FROM OTHER VEHICLES, IF POSSIBLE, TO AVOID OPENING-DOOR CONTACT WITH VEHICLES ALREADY PARKED. AS THE STEERING WHEEL IS BEING TURNED TO PARK IN A SPECIFIC SPOT, A VEHICLE USUALLY MOVES SLOWLY BECAUSE OF ITS OWN FORWARD MOTION WHEN IN DRIVE;THEREFORE, IT'S NORMAL TO KEEP A FOOT ON THE BRAKE PEDAL TO COME TO A FINAL STOP.A NARROW SIDEWALK SEPARATES THE PARKING AREA FROM THE BUILDING OUTSIDE WALL.I APPROACHED THE SIDEWALK SLOWLY TO AVOID HITTING THE CURB WITH THE TIRES.SUDDENLY, THE PATHFINDER LURCHED FORWARD, HITTING THE CURB AT A HIGH SPEED.I WAS NOT ABLE TO STOP THE VEHICLE EVEN THOUGH I PRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL FULLY.THE VEHICLE CLIMBED ON THE SIDEWALK AND HIT THE WALL.THE IMPACT ON THE WALL CAUSED BOTH FRONT AIR BAGS TO BE ACTIVATED, THE WINDSHIELD CRACKED ON THE PASSENGER SIDE,AND THE CAR ALARM WENT OFF AS THE FRONT FENDER HIT THE WALL. I RECEIVED CUTS AND BRUISES ON BOTH ARMS, PROBABLY CAUSED BY BY THE SEAT BELT AND THE AIR BAG.THE PATHFINDER SUFFERED $ 7,218.74 IN DAMAGES.BUILDING PROPERTY DAMAGE (STILL UNDETERMINED) WAS ALSO CAUSED.THE WALL ON EACH FLOOR OF THE PARKING GARAGE IS MADE OF PRE-STRESSED CONCRETE SLABS ABOUT 4 OR 5 FEET TALL AND REINFORCED WITH STRETCHED STEEL CABLES.THE CONCRETE SLAB CRACKED AND BENT SLIGHTLY OUTWARDS ALONG THE MIDDLE;FORTUNATELY, IT DID NOT COLLAPSE.*AK",

THE NEXT DAY, WE RECEIVED TELEPHONE CALL FROM THE SERVICE DEPT WHO INFORMED US THAT THE TRANSFER CASE WAS DAMAGED.  THE SERVICE REP TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS AN INTERNAL DEFECT ON THE PART AND THAT THE PROBLEM WAS VERY UNCOMMON.  THE TRANSFER CASE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOUR WHEEL DRIVE ON THE PATHFINDER - WHICH IS SOMETHING WE HAVE PROBABLY USED LESS THAN 10 TIMES IN THE 4 1/2 YEARS THAT WE HAVE DRIVEN THE CAR.  PARTS AND LABOR ON THIS REPAIR WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $2,500.  I ASKED FOR NISSAN'S CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER AND CONTACTED THEM IMMEDIATELY.  WE WERE TOLD THAT THE PART HAD TO BE SPECIALLY ORDERED AND WOULD  NOT BE FIXED FOR 4-5 DAYS.  ON THE 4TH DAY, WE WERE CONTACTED BY THE SERVICE DEPT TO INFORM US THAT THEY HAD REPLACED THE PART, BUT THAT THE TRANSFER CASE HAD APPARENTLY DAMAGED THE TRANSMISSION AND THAT HAD TO BE REPLACED.  THIS WOULD BE THE TOTAL OF REPAIRS TO  APPROX $5,000.  AGAIN, I CONTACTED THE NISSAN'S CUSTOMER SERVICE BECAUSE I HAD NOT GOTTEN A TELEPHONE CALL FROM MY ORIGINAL CALL.  WHEN WE FINALLY REACHED SOMEONE AT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT WE EXPLAINED THAT WE HAD GOTTEN ALL THE RECOMMENDED PREVENTATIVE MAINTENACE ON THE PATHFINDER.  THIS WAS ALSO THE 3RD NISSAN WE HAD PURCHASED AND UP UNTIL NOW HAD BEEN VERY SATISFIED WITH THEIR RELIABILITY.  GIVEN OUR PURCHASE AND MAINTENANCE HISTORY,WE WERE LED TO BELIEVE FROM THE SERVICE DEPT THAT NISSAN WOULD GIVE US A BREAK ON THE REPAIRS.  IN ADDITION, WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE DEFECT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DETECTED DURING OUR REGULAR PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE (WHICH TOTALS IN THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS) AND THAT WHAT WAS AN OTHERWISE WELL MAINTAINED TRANSMISSION WAS RUINED BY A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT.  NISSAN'S FINAL RESPONSE WAS THAT WE WERE OUT OF WARRANTY AND THEY WOULD DO NOTHING FOR US.  WHY WAS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT NOT RECALLED?  *NLM",

WE TRAVELED FOR QUITE A DISTANCE ON THE GRASSED AREA WHICH WAS LIGHTLY SNOW COVERED AND CONTINUED CLOSELY BY THE TREE LINE.  MY HUSBAND WAS A TRUCK DRIVER AND WAS ABLE TO KEEP US FROM HITTING THE TREES BUT WE SLID OVER A DIP IN THE TERRAIN THAT SENT OUR VEHICLE FLYING THROUGH THE AIR AND AFTER LANDING MY HUSBAND WAS ABLE TO BRING IT TO REST IN A DITCH AFTER HITTING A CEMENT CULVERT.  WE FOUND WE HAD A BLOWN TIRE IN THE REAR AND THE FRONT TIRE EXPLODED ON IMPACT WITH THE CULVERT.  THE FRONT RIGHT OF THE VEHICLE SUSTAINED DAMAGE.  ALL OF US WERE IN SEATBELTS.  OUR SON DID NOT GET HURT(HE WAS IN THE BACK SEAT AND I HAD MY BODY TURNED TRYING TO HOLD HIM DOWN.  THE IMPACT SENT MY RIGHT HAND SIDE FLYING INTO THE FRONT DASH AND DOOR.  I SUSTAINED CONSIDERABLE INJURY TO MY RIGHT HAND SHOULDER AND ARM AND WAS OUT OF WORK AND IN PHYSICAL THERAPY FOR MONTHS.  MY HUSBAND WAS ALSO THROWN AROUND CONSIDERABLY.  TO THIS DAY WE HAVE NO IDEA AND THE POLICE COULD NOT PINPOINT ANY REASON FOR THIS CRASH OTHER THAN A DEFECTIVE TIRE.  WE THOUGHT THE DESIGN IN THE PATHFINDER MIGHT BE FAULTY AND I DID REPORT THIS INCIDENT TO THE NHTSA IN FEB/MARCH OF THAT YEAR.  WE HAVE SINCE GOTTEN RID OF THE PATHFINDER AS OUR SON WAS TERRIFIED TO TRAVEL IN IT.  THE VEHICLE ITSELF HELD UP WELL IN THE CRASH AND WE CONSIDER OURSELVES LUCKY TO HAVE BEEN IN SUCH A WELL MADE VEHICLE.  WE HAVE SINCE PURCHASED A NEWER PATHFINDER AND HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS.  HOWEVER THE TIRES FROM THE PREVIOUS PATHFINDER ARE ON MY FATHER-IN-LAWS CHEVY TRUCK AND WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A DEFECT IN THE MANUFACTURE OF THE TIRE.  THIS RECENT RECALL HAS CAUSED US TO THINK ABOUT THAT ACCIDENT AND WE FIRMLY BELIEVE WE HAD DEFECTIVE TIRES.( DOT NUMBER:   TIRE SIZE: ATXP70 )",
