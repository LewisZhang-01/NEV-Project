THE OTHER THREE WHEELS ALSO HAD LOOSE WIRES THAT THE TECHNICIAN HAD TO SECURE, THOUGH THEY DIDN'T NEED TO BE MENDED.     THE PROBLEM WAS FIRST NOTICED WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION ON A CITY STREET. THE BRAKE CONTROL BOX WAS READING SHORT CIRCUIT AND EVENTUALLY WENT TO AN OVERLOADED CONDITION AND STOPPED APPLYING THE BRAKES ALTOGETHER.",
