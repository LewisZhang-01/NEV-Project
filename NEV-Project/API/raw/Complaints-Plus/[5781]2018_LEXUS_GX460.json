THE SERVICE PERSONNEL SAID THAT THIS IS NORMAL FOR THE CAR TO LEAN, AND I TOLD THEM THAT WHEN THE CAR IS IN MOTION YOU CAN EVEN TELL AND FEEL  THAT IT IS LEANING. THEY SAID THAT IT IS NORMAL, THIS IS PART OF THE KDSS SYSTEM AND THERE IS NOTHING TO BE WORRIED ABOUT. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE MY TWO KIDS GET TO RIDE THIS CAR, MY FAMILY. AND I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THIS IS  A SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH, AND FOR YEARS SINCE THE PREVIOUS MODEL OF GX 460 THEY SAID ITS NORMAL EVEN IF ITS NOT NORMAL.. THIS IS NOT A GOOD QUALITY CAR MADE FOR FAMILY. I WASTED MY HARD EARNED $56,000.  I BOUGHT THIS CAR BRAND NEW WITH $3000 DOWNPAYMENT.
