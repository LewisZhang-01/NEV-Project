        "summary": "TAKATA RECALL     I WAS A COURIER WITH THE POSTMATES PROGRAM FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS AND I WAS A NEW PARTICIPANT OF THE POSTMATES SCOOTER PROGRAM BACK IN MAY.     ON THE AFTERNOON OF SATURDAY, MAY 13TH -DUE TO HEAVY RAIN, STRONG WINDS, AND POOR ROAD CONDITIONS -I ENCOUNTERED A PROBLEM WITH THE SCOOTER WHILE CONDUCTING ROUTINE POSTMATES DELIVERIES, WHICH WOULDN'T ALLOW ME TO ACCELERATE PAST 15 - 17 MPH AFTER SHOWING A YELLOW EXCLAMATION POINT ICON ON THE TOP RIGHT CORNER OF THE TOUCH SCREEN. FURTHERMORE, I NOTICED THE SCOOTER BATTERY DRAINED MUCH FASTER THAN BEFORE AND THE TURNING SIGNALS FROZE IN PLACE. CONCERNED WITH MY SAFETY ON THE ROAD, I DETERMINED THAT THE SCOOTER WAS UNSAFE TO RIDE AND I WAS FORCED TO STOP IN ORDER TO PREVENT A TRAFFIC COLLISION WITH THE ONCOMING VEHICLES. ON SUNDAY, MAY 14TH, I RETURNED TO THE LOCATION OF THE SCOOTER IN MANHATTAN WITH THE TWO BATTERIES, WHICH I MADE SURE THEY WERE OPERATIONAL AND CHARGED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SCOOTER OWNER'S MANUAL. AFTER THAT, I PUT ON A FRESHLY CHARGED BATTERY AND OFF I WENT. THE SCOOTER OPERATED FINE UNTIL AROUND 10:30PM THAT NIGHT, WHILE EN ROUTE TO A DELIVERY DESTINATION.    UNFORTUNATELY, THE SCOOTER MALFUNCTIONED AGAIN WHEN I WENT OVER A ROUGH PIECE OF ROAD DEBRIS DURING THE HEAVY RAIN IN LOWER MANHATTAN. THIS TIME, THE SCOOTER WOULD NOT ACCELERATE OVER 15 MPH ALONGSIDE VERY FAST MOVING TRAFFIC. SINCE THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED WHILE ON A VERY BUSY STREET, I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER TO A NEARBY BIKE LANE ADJACENT TO THE ROAD TO AVOID A POTENTIAL TRAFFIC COLLISION WITH ONCOMING VEHICLES.     THIS WAS WHEN I WAS STOPPED BY A NYC PARKS ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WHO GAVE ME A $500 SUMMONS FOR UNLAWFULLY OPERATING A MOTORIZED SCOOTER ON THE BIKE PATH. I MENTIONED TO THE OFFICER THE NATURE OF THE INCIDENT AND THAT I FELT THE SCOOTER WAS UNABLE TO ACCELERATE IN A POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS 35 MPH STREET ZONE WITH HEAVY TRAFFIC.",
