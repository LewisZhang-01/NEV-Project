THE TIRES ARE TRAILER KING ST225/75R15 WITH A MAX WEIGHT RATING OF 2,540LBS EACH. THE TRAILER HAS FOUR (4) WITH A DUAL AXLE SETUP. THESE ARE FACTORY ISSUED TIRES.

I AM IN THE PROCESS OF REPLACING ALL THE TIRES ON THE TRAILER AS I CANNOT AFFORD A BLOW-OUT AND I THINK I'M ON THE PATH TO ONE WITH THESE TIRES.
