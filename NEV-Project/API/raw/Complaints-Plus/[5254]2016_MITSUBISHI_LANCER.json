Also while driving vehicle its rpms fluctuate causing a shudder and surge in power or acceleration. This is a very alarming problem as it puts mine and my kids safety as it hesitates to shift and while driving it loses power and then powers up by itself. We have taken to a transmission shop (HIgH TECH Transmission) and now a dealer (Mission Mitsubishi) and both have replicated problem and pulled code but dealer will not honor recall or repair it. There was a safety recall for 2016 lancers with a cvt8 (SR-16-006) that produces a code P084A as well which and that if both were present a replacement transmission should be approved. All information was pulled from Mitsubishi website, and I called them and spoke to Carla did not give a last name and she advised me that our lancer doesn\u2019t have a recall and I said well is it possible you\u2019ll missed some vehicles that have the same problem from the recalls you\u2019ll have already put out? And she got snappy and said to contact safer car.gov; so here I am, presenting facts to you'll that my 2016 lancer may and hopefully is part of a recall which in result to not being identified or checked out caused more damage as stated it would on the manufacturers website. And needs to be fixed due to not being identified in recall so preventive measures could have been taken. Please our vehicle is experiencing the problem as a recall Mitsubishi put out but failed to identify our lancer and now is experiencing hesitation in CVT trans, and shudder/surge in transmission.",

FOR THOSE FEW SECONDS THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO BUT PRESS THE GAS PEDAL HARDER WHEN THOUGH THE CAR IS NOT DOING ANYTHING. AFTER THOSE FEW SECONDS THE CAR TRANSMISSION KICKS IN AND YOU EVENTUALLY HAVE CONTROL IN ACCELERATION ONCE AGAIN.   TOOK TO THE DEALER TODAY. THEY SAID NO RECALLS ON THE VEHICLE. ONLINE I SEE A SIMILAR RECALL ON THE OUTLANDER TRANSMISSION BUT SERVICE TECH SAYS HE CHECKED AND NOTHING ON THE LANCER. THEY DROVE MY CAR AND OF COURSE IT DON'T HAPPEN. IT'S VERY RANDOM. IT USUALLY HAPPENS ONCE A WEEK. IT HAS PROB OCCURRED ABOUT 10 TIMES IF NOT MORE. THERE IS NO WAY TO EXPECT IT SO NOW I HAVE TO TAKE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN I'M ABOUT TO PULL OUT ON A BUSY ROAD WITH TRAFFIC COMING MY WAY.   HAS ANYONE ELSE HAD THIS ISSUE WITH THEIR LANCER?",

IT HAPPENS AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF DRIVING AND WHEN I'M COMING UP TO A STOP SIGN AND GOING TO ACCELERATE AGAIN AFTER DOING RESEARCH ONLINE AND TAKING IT TO MY DEALERSHIP THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY CANNOT FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM I FOUND A RECALL ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE FOR MY VEHICLE WITH MY VIN NUMBER INCLUDED IN THE RANGE OF IN NUMBERS EXPERIENCING THIS EXACT PROBLEM. I NEED HELP GETTING MY DEALERSHIP TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS BECAUSE IT IS NOT ON THEIR WEBSITE. I HAVE ALMOST BEEN REAR-ENDED MULTIPLE TIMES BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM AND I AM AFRAID FOR MY SAFETY",
