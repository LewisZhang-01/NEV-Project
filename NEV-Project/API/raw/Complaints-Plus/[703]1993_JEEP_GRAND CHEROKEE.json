I NOTICED A VIBRATION IN THE CAR AND CONFIRMED THAT A WELT HAD APPEARED IN THE TIRE JUST OF CENTERLINE.  I WAS ON MY WAY BACK FROM A BUSINESS TRIP WHICH WAS JUST 200 MILES FROM MY HOME AND THE TIRE DISINTEGRATED WHILE I WAS TRAVELING ON THE HIGHWAY.  I FEEL THAT THIS CONDITION HAS HAPPENED ENTIRELY TOO OFTEN AND IT IS WITH THE SAME TIRE BRAND AND TYPE.  I HAVE NOT BEEN TO THE TIRE DEALER YET, BUT I DID WANT TO REPORT THIS IN CASE THERE IS A PROBLEM AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE REPORTING IT ALSO.  THANKS FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.*AK",

MY SON WAS DRIVING AND I SUGGESTED HE GET IN THE OUTSIDE LANE AND SLOW DOWN TO SEE OF THE SMELL GOT WORSE OR WENT AWAY. ALL THE ENGINE GAUGES READ FINE. AS WE WERE TRYING TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO, THE CAR SUDDENLY TOOK A COUPLE OF HARD JERKS AND THERE WAS A LOUD BANG. THE ENGINE WAS STILL RUNNING, BUT THE CAR WAS COMING TO A QUICK STOP. WE WERE IN THE OUTSIDE LANE, BUT RIGHT AT THE I-695 EXIT SO THERE WERE 2 MORE EXIT LANES ON OUR RIGHT. WE COULDN'T GET TO THE SHOULDER. THE CAR CAME TO STOP QUICKLY; IT DIDN'T APPEAR TO WANT TO COAST EVEN WHEN I SUGGESTED MY SON MOVE THE TRANSMISSION LEVER TO NEUTRAL. ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE WAS A LOT OF SMOKE COMING OUT FROM UNDER THE REAR OF THE CAR. AT FIRST I HESITATED TO GET OUT OF THE CAR FOR FEAR OF BEING HIT BY OTHER TRAFFIC AND WE COULDN'T SEE TO  OUR REAR BECAUSE OF THE SMOKE. WHEN I REALIZED THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC COMING PAST US, I GOT OUT OF THE REAR SEAT AND LOOKED UNDER THE CAR; THERE WERE FLAMES. I YELLED AT MY WIFE AND SON TO GET OUT OF THE CAR AND WE ALL WENT ACROSS TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD. THE JEEP BURNED TOTALLY. . LATER IN SPEAKING TO THE FIRE CAPTAIN, HE TOLD US THAT THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL OF THE CAR HAD BEEN CHERRY RED. THEY HAD PUT 700 GALLONS ON THE CAR TO PUT OUT THE FIRE AND COOL OF THE DIFFERENTIAL. IT APPEARS THE DIFFERENTIAL HAD FAILED (I BELIEVE IT WAS THE INPUT BEARING WHERE THE DRIVE SHAFT CONNECTS), OBVIOUSLY GOTTEN VERY HOT, AND LOCKED UP CAUSING THE DRIVE SHAFT TO BREAK OFF AT THE DIFFERENTIAL (THAT END OF THE DRIVE SHAFT WAS RESTING ON THE GROUND). WHEN THE THINGS STARTED BREAKING, THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME RUPTURE OF A FUEL LINE OR THE FUEL TANK; THEN THERE WAS FIRE.*A",

WE WERE INFORMED BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT, THAT THE RUSTED ROTORS WERE NOT COVERED BY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY WE PURCHASED.  THAT WAS 4/98.  SEPTEMBER OF 2000 I DISCOVERED THE RECALL WHILE DOING SOME RESEARCH.   THIS TIME I CONTACTED BOBETTE THOMAS AT JIM MARSH SERVICE ABOUT THE RUSTED ROTARS.  SHE TOOK THE INFORMATION AND CALLED ME BACK LATER THAT DAY.   I WAS INFORMED THAT THE RECALL DID NOT AFFECT MY VEHICLE.  WE PURCHASED IT USED AND DO NOT KNOW WHERE IT ORIGINATED.  WE BELIEVE THE RUSTED ROTARS ARE A PRODUCT OF IMPROPER MANUFACTURING PROCESSES.  I AM REQUESTING THAT JEEP REPAIR OR REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE PARTS AND HONOR THE RECALL.                #2 SINCE PURCHASING THIS USED VEHICLE WE HAVE HAD REPEATED FUEL INJECTOR PROBLEMS.  WE HAVE TAKEN IT TO BE SERVICED FOR FUEL ODORS ON 8 DIFFERENT OCCASSIONS IN THE PAST 3 YEARS.  ON THREE OF THOSE OCCASSIONS WE WERE TOLD NOTHING WAS WRONG. YET THE SMELL CONTINUED.  THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE'S FUEL INJECTOR SYSTEM.  AGAIN MY VEHICLE IS EXPERIENCING INTERMITANT FUEL ODORS.  IT IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY AND WE A FAILURE RATE AS EXTENSIVE AS OURS HAS BEEN IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.  I BELIEVE HAD THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM  THAT IS CAUSING THIS REPEATED FAILURE, BEEN DIAGNOSED WHEN INITIALLY TAKEN TO THE DEALERSHIP OUR WARRANTY WOULD HAVE RESOLVED THE ISSUE.  I WOULD LIKE THIS PROBLEM ADDRESSED IN IT'S ENTIRETY.    #3 REAR HATCHBACK DOORLOCKS AND LATCH.  1-12-98 I REPORTED A LOCK PROBLEM AND THE CLOSURE PROBLEMS I HAD BEEN HAVING.

THE FIRST VISIT, THEY MADE REPLACMENTS TO PARTS THAT COGDILL FELT WERE NOT NECESSARY FROM THERE INVESTIGATION EARLIER.  I MADE THE SECOND TRIP.  THEY LOOKED AT IT FOR OVER 2 HOURS AND COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM.  I HAD TO HAVE MY VEHICLE FOR TRANSPORTATION.  I LEFT AND DECIDED TO RETURN BACK THE NEXT DAY.

THAT WAS REPLACED AT A COST OF 88.00, PLUS 60.00 FOR THE RENTAL CAR FOR TWO DAYS.  THE PARTS HAD TO BE SHIPPED IN FROM ATLANTA.  I DROVE THE JEEP AND SMELLED ODORS BUT WAS ADVISED THAT THAT WOULD OCCUR DUE TO THE MAINTAINCE THAT WAS PERFORMED.  AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS I BEGAN TO SMELL THE GASOLINE AGAIN.  I PUT UP WITH IT FOR A WEEK, AND DECIDED THAT I DID NOT WANT  MY VEHICLE TO CATCH ON FIRE AND CAUSE LOSS OF HOME AND POSSIBLY BODY LOSS AS WELL.  I RETURNED MY JEEP TO DELMAR HAYNES ON 1-12-00.  I ASKED THEM TO COLD START IT AGAIN AND SEE IF THEY COULD SEE THE TROUBLE.  GUT FEELING ON MY PART WAS THE FUEL INJECTORS WOULD ALL HAVE TO BE REPLACED.  BINGO!!

WHILE ATTEMPTING TO BRAKE,IN MY DRIVEWAY, THE CAR SHARPLY SWERVES TO THE LEFT.  BRAKES HAVE FAILED ENTIRELY WHILE IN 4-WHEEL DRIVE IN SNOW 2-3 INCHES DEEP @ 5-10 MPH. BRAKES HAVE LOCKED REPEATEDLY AFTER GOING THROUGH A CAR WASH.

ONCE,IN A SHOPPING CENTER PARKING LOT THIS CAUSED MY SON TO HIT HIS HEAD ON THE DASHBOARD WHILE HE WAS FASTENING HIS SEAT BELT. I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT I NEEDED TO LEARN TO DRIVE DIFFERENTLY WITH ABS, THAT IT WAS A USER PROBLEM, NOT A PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLE. DURING DRY MONTHS IN CALIFORNIA I HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKES. I DREAD THE RAINY SEASONS AND HAVE EVEN CONSIDERED SELLING MY HOUSE BECAUSE THE JEEP SERVICE MANAGER SAID THAT I WOULDN'T BE HAVING ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS IF I DIDN'T HAVE A \"STEEP DRIVEWAY.\"  MY KIDS HAVE BEEN WITH ME A FEW TIMES WHEN THE HORRIBLE NOISE, SKIDDING AND SHAKING HAVE OCCURRED AND THEY WERE SCARED TO DEATH. MY SON ATTEMPTED TO JUMP OUT OF THE CAR ONCE, IN THE DRIVEWAY, BECAUSE HE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO CRASH. I HAVE SAVED ALL OF MY SERVICE RECORDS FROM THE DEALER BUT A COUPLE OF TIMES THEY DID NOT ENTER MY BRAKE COMPLAINTS INTO THE COMPUTER, JUST THE NORMAL SERVICE I WAS HAVING DONE AT THE TIME.
