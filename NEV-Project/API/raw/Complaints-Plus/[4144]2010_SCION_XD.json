        "summary": "There is a repetitive problem with mold and AC leaks with the Scion xD. I\u2019m having breathing problems and I feel sick.  Geico and Toyota have discovered mold in my vehicle.  It is actually visible but I have no idea how long there has been a leak or how long I have been breathing in mold.  The AC line is under the carpet with no protective barrier which is an ideal environment for mold to grow. When I looked up a way to fix the issue several videos came up with many others who have the same issue which means it is not a maintenance issue it is a defect that has never been recalled. Toyota has serviced my vehicle for years and never brought up this issue.  I didn\u2019t notice a problem until there was a pool of water in my car and mold growing on my seats. When I brought it in to Toyota they  told me what the problem was instantly. They\u2019ve seen it plenty of times before.  When I looked online I see several owners of ScionxD made in different years with the same problem. How long has my car had this leak and how long have I been breathing in mold before it was visible to my eye? Seeing as there are so many Toyota Scion drivers/owners with this issue I am reporting it to NHTSA and calling Toyota Scion Corporate Headquarters. Corporate headquarters did nothing about the issue even after I expressed my concern for the children in danger of being exposed to mold who ride in these cars everyday. I am still breathing heavy and suffering from headaches. The Toyota dealership said it would cost $4400 to fix the entire issue. Why place a tube under a carpet without protection?  I wish I was informed of this earlier.",

WENT TO PASS AND ACCELERATED TO 50 MPH WHEN ENGINE BECAME ABNORMALLY LOUD AND FELT AS THOUGH SOMEONE HAD TAKEN OVER THE CAR AND IT WANTED TO RACE. RPMS WERE MAXED. I FLOORED BRAKES AND GOT VEHICLE TO SLOW TO 40MPH. PULLED BACK INTO MY LANE, BUT COULD NOT GET THE CAR TO GO ANY SLOWER. I FELT AS IF I WAS GOING TO HIT THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME. WITH TWO BIG TRUCKS BEHIND ME, I FEARED CAUSING AN ACCIDENT. I PULLED OFF ONTO THE GRAVEL ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND CONTINUED DRIVING. I COULD NOT STOP SO THREW IT INTO PARK AT 40 MPH. ENGINE MADE A HORRENDOUSLY LOUD NOISE AS IF IT WAS GOING TO BLOW UP. TURNED CAR OFF AND ON. MADE SAME AWFUL NOISE. TURNED CAR OFF, WAITED 10 MINS, TURNED BACK ON AND IT WAS FINE. TOOK IT TO THE TOYOTA TO BE SERVICED ON MON AND DESCRIBED ACCIDENT. I ASSUMED THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL, AND ASKED IF THERE WERE ANY RECALLS REGARDING THIS ISSUE. AFTER THAT I LEARNED OF THE UNINTENDED ACCLERATION (UA) ISSUE THAT TOYOTA DEALT WITH AND THE 1.2 BILLION DOLLAR SETTLEMENT FOR THE VICTIMS WHO HAD DIED OR WERE HARMED IN ACCIDENTS. MY CAR WAS MANUFACTURED AT THIS TIME AND MY ENGINE IS A TOYOTA COROLLA. I CALLED TOYOTA HEADQUARTERS AND WAS TREATED RUDELY AND SCOFFED AT . I CALLED MANAGER TO REPORT. SHE SET UP AN APPOINTMENT BACK AT THE SAME DEALERSHIP. 2-DAY INVESTIGATION DETERMINED IT WAS DUE TO MY AFTER-MARKET FLOOR MATS CAUSING THE PEDAL ENTRAPMENT. I HAD ACTUALLY TRIED TO REPLICATE THIS ISSUE IN MY DRIVEWAY PRIOR TO THE EXAM AND DID GET THE PEDAL TO STICK WITH MAT, BUT I COULD NOT GET THE RPMS TO ACCELERATE MUCH, NOTHING LIKE I HAD EXPERIENCED (10 RPM VS 3). I ALSO DID NOT FEEL A FLOOR MAT CATCH OR RELEASE DURING EVENT. IN MY SIMULATION I FELT  IT CATCH AND RELEASE. I ASKED TO SPEAK TO THE TECHNICIAN REGARDING THIS ISSUE.
