        "summary": "*Incomplete Recall Status* ***Defect in transfer case***  Complaint of Manufacturer Defect in 2005 Dodge Dakota Quad Cab 4x4 3.7l v6. While driving at a speed of 30mph on a smooth paved highway and selector switch turned to 2 wheel drive mode; out of nowhere, the transfer case tried to engage 4 High which resulted in SVC 4X4 warning lamp illumination and a loud grinding/stuttering sound from under carriage as well as halting me to 10 mph without any help from me. after pulling over on the roadside and putting truck in park and turning the engine off, i waited a couple of minutes and SVC 4X4 indicator and 4High dash light had gone. I restarted the truck only to find that the SVC 4X4 Warning lamp immediately returned and now the 4lo illuminated dash light is constantly showing and truck is still showing in 2 wheel drive with selector switch but 4x4 will not engage at all now. Took to a mechanic shop 1/2 mile down the road and had it read for any DTCs and inspected. Code came back as C1404. Transfer case still tries to engage as soon as truck door is opened and dome light comes on. SVC 4X4 warning indicator stays on the dash lit up and 4lo warning light flashes non stop. Manufacturers communication letter has been sent to dealerships for the proper installation steps of the transfer case on the model of my truck due to improper positioning. I have noticed no Recall but have found a Campaign ID listed for this issue. I've owned this truck for only DAYS now with the intention of presenting it to daughter for her 16th birthday next month and now there's a BIG concern here for safety and the fact that a recall hasn't been issued is crazy! ....it's completely absurd and should be escalated immediately until a consumer resolution is made. This truck is NOT safe at all with this defect by manufacturer transfer case!   I am demanding that this faulty part be investigated and taken considerable responsibility for just for the amount of time allowed to pass!!",

DUE TO EXCESSIVE RUST AND WEAR.  MY TRUCK HAS BARELY BEEN ON THE ROAD FOR ITS YEAR AND HAS HAD MINIMAL EXPOSURE TO ROAD CHEMICALS SUCH AS SALT ETC.  THESE COMPONENTS ROTTING AWAY TO THIS EXTENT WITH SUCH LOW MILEAGE REGARDLESS OF AGE INDICATES THE USE OF POOR QUALITY MATERIALS BEING USED DURING ASSEMBLY AND POSING A POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE TO CONSUMERS.

I HAVE NOTICED THAT LATELY MY SEAT HAD BEEN GETTING AWFUL \"HOT\" BUT NEVER THOUGH IT MIGHT BE BURNING. THEN, TUES JAN 22, I GOT OUT OF MY TRUCK AND NOTICED THE HOLE BURNT IN THE BOTTOM CUSHION. I HAVE SPENT THE PAST WEEK TALKING WITH THE DEALER AND CHRYSLER ABOUT IT SINCE IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE. CHRYSLER IS WILLING TO HELP ME OUT 50% COST. WHAT I AM FINDING OUT IS THAT THE DEALER ARTIFICIALLY INFLATES THE COSTS SO THAT IN REALITY, IT REALLY WON'T COST CHRYSLER A DIME.   OBVIOUSLY, THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SOME TIME. THE PROBLEM WITH THE NHTSA IS THAT THESE ISSUES ARE MINOR TO THEM IN THE BIG PICTURE OF THINGS PERCENTAGE WISE - SO THEY IGNORE IT. BUT TO THE CONSUMER, IT IS MAJOR. IF THE NHTSA WAS SMART OR REALLY ON TOP OF THINGS - THEY WOULD LOOK AT THE OVERALL NUMBERS OF THE CAR COMPANY AND THEY WOULD FIND THAT THE CHRYSLER CORP. HAS HAD TROUBLE WITH THEIR HEATED SEATS FOR OVER A DECADE. ALL THEIR BRANDS. RECALL ON JEEP GR CHEROKEE 2001-2004 ; SEBRING; TOWN & COUNTRY; DODGE/RAM TRUCKS. WHY DOES NHTSA NOT CARE ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS IN THESE CASES. THERE WAS A PARALYZED MAN THAT HAD HIS SEAT ACCIDENTALLY TURNED ON - HE ENDED UP WITH THIRD DEGREE BURNS ON HIS THIGH ABOUT THE SIZE OF A QUARTER. I WOULD SAY THAT THE NHTSA NEEDS TO DO SOME HOMEWORK ON CHRYSLER AND EXERCISE A RECALL ON ALL OF THESE HEATED SEAT ELEMENTS. HOW MANY PEOPLE NEED TO SUFFER? WHY IS EVERYTHING BASED ON NUMBERS?? DOES ANYONE IN THIS WORLD CARE ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS BEING HARMED??IN MY OPINION, YOU ARE FAILING TERRIBLY BY NOT GOING AFTER THE CHRYSLER CORP. FOR THEIR NEGLECT.

I INSPECTED THE SYSTEM SEVERAL TIMES AND CONCLUDED THAT 1 OR MORE OF THE BALL JOINTS WERE DRY AND NEEDED GREASE. THE BALL JOINTS HAD NO FITTINGS TO APPLY GREASE SO A NEEDLE VALVE WAS USED TO INJECT GREASE INTO THE BOOTS. THIS HELPED FOR A SHORT PERIOD BUT THE CREAKING CAME BACK A FEW MONTHS LATER.  I SENT THIS VEHICLE INTO THE REPAIR SHOP AND THEY SAID THE LOWER BALL JOINTS WERE DRY AND HAD EXCESS SIDE PLAY.

THEY UTILIZE A SINGLE SPRING BETWEEN THE REAR BRAKE SHOES WHICH CREATES VARYING DEGREES OF BRAKE SHUDDERING UPON APPLICATION. IN ADDITION MANY OF THESE TRUCKS ARE EQUIPPED WITH DEFECTIVE AXLES WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE SHUDDERING PROBLEM. IN LATE 2005, DODGE ISSUED A TSB TO THEIR DEALERS ON HOW TO CORRECT THESE PROBLEMS. THIS WAS SOON SUPERSEDED BY TSB 05-002-006. I PURCHASED A TRUCK WITH BOTH THE DEFECTIVE BRAKES AND DEFECTIVE AXLES IN AUGUST OF 2005. I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED OF EITHER TSB BY CHRYSLER CORPORATION. I NOW UNDERSTAND THAT SINCE MY VEHICLE IS OVER ONE YEAR OLD THAT I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR MUCH OF THE COST OF REPAIRING THESE FACTORY DEFECTS TO AN IMPORTANT SAFETY SYSTEM. DODGE ISSUED TWO TSB'S AND BEGAN INSTALLING A PROPERLY DESIGNED REAR BRAKE ASSEMBLY ON ALL NEW DAKOTAS BUILT AFTER JANUARY 2006. I BELIEVE THAT DODGE SHOULD ISSUE AN IMMEDIATE SAFETY RECALL FOR ALL AFFECTED 2005 AND EARLY 2006 DAKOTA TRUCKS AND REPAIR THEM FOR LITTLE OR NO COST TO THE OWNER.

MY CONCERN IS THIS THEY DON'T HAVE A KEY HOLE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. IT IS SAD TO SAY IT ISN'T A SAFE WORLD TODAY. I DID ASK DODGE WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I PARK MY TRUCK IN A PARKING LOT AND WHEN I GOT OUT OF A STORE THERE WAS A VAN PARK BESIDE MY TRUCK ON THE DRIVERS SIDE WITH A GUY IN THE VAN. HOW WOULD I GET INTO MY TRUCK? MY REMOTE DOESN'T WORK I DON'T HAVE A KEY HOLE ON THE OTHER SIDE. HE JUST TOLD ME IT WASN'T A SAFETY ISSUE. SO I JUST ASKED HIM DO YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO GET HURT FIRST? I DID HAD THE REMOTE SENSOR CHECK AND WAS TOLD THAT WAS FINE. I HAD ASK THEM THIS SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY ESPECIALLY CAUSE THE TRUCK HAS ONE KEY HOLE. I WANTED THEM TO COVER IT UNDER THE WARRANTY OR GIVE ME ANOTHER KEY HOLE. I FEEL ALL VEHICLES SHOULD HAVE THE TWO KEY HOLES. ALSO ONE TIME I HAD A CAR PARK SO CLOSE TO MY DRIVER DOOR THAT I HAD TO MANY SHOPPING BAGS THAT I COULDN'T GET IN MY TRUCK. WENT TO THE PASSENGER SIDE TO GET IN AND I FORGOT I COULDN'T I HAD TO PUT ALL MY BAGS DOWN TO GO AROUND TO UNLOCK MY DOOR. THEN WENT AROUND TO GET IN. ALSO WHAT HAPPENS IF THE KEY HOLE FREEZES? YOU CAN'T TRY THE OTHER SIDE. I DON 'T KNOW IF IT IS A LAW OR NOT BUT I NOTICE IN LARGE VEHICLES WHEN A SUV OR VANS BACK UP THEY HAVE THAT BEEPING NOISE. WHICH I THINK THAT IS A GREAT IDEA. (IT SHOULD BE A LAW IF IT ISN'T).

COMMON SENSE WOULD DICTATE THAT IMPROVED ENGINE SHOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO TOW MORE WEIGHT SINCE IT NOW HAS MORE HORSEPOWER AND MORE TORQUE.

TO ADDRESS THE VIBRATION PROBLEM  DODGE CAME OUT WITH A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (TSB), #05-004-05 REV. A, TO ADDRESS THE VIBRATION PROBLEM. BULLETIN COMPLIED WITH WHICH AMOUNT TO REFACING THE FRONT DISCS & REAR DRUMS,& REPLACEMENT OF THE REAR LININGS. AT TIME OF PICK UP THE BRAKE PEDAL  HAD TO BE PUMPED 2 OR MORE TIMES TO OBTAIN BRAKING ACTION. UPON RE-INSPECTION BY THE DEALER THEY FOUND THAT ONE OF THE AUTOMATIC ADJUSTER LOCK DOWN SPRING HAD BECOME LOOSE. RE-ATTACHED, IT SOLVED THE PUMPING OF THE BRAKE PEDAL GOING TO THE FLOOR.   HOWEVER, THE ONCE FIRM BRAKE PEDAL IS NOW TOO SOFT AND NO AMOUNT OF PUMPING WILL PROVIDE A FIRM FEEL.  THE DEALER TRIED TO CALL DODGE TECHNICAL SERVICES.   THEY ADVISED THAT COULD NOT FIND AN ANSWER OR REASON FOR THE PROBLEM.

BRIEF HISTORY; PRIOR TO THE 2005 INTRODUCTION OF THE REVISED/UPDATED 2005 DAKOTA THE PREVIOUS MODELS HAD 4 WHEEL DISC BRAKES THAT WERE NOT CAUSING ANY PROBLEMS. FOR 2005  DODGE CHANGED FROM THE 4 WHEEL DISCS TO FRONT DISCS & REAR DRUMS. I WILL BE MOVING FROM GEORGIA TO ILLINOIS IN THE NEAR FUTURE & HAVE ALREADY MADE SIX TRIPS TOWING A 5' X 8\" U-HAUL TRAILER AND HAVE EXPERIENCED MANY OCCASIONS THAT THE FACTORY INSTALLED BRAKES FADE EXCESSIVELY TO ALMOST NO BRAKES.  *NM",

THEY'VE HAD THEIR TRUCKS IN THE SHOP MULTIPLE TIMES FOR THE SAME PROBLEM WITH NO RESOLUTION. I UNDERSTAND THEIR FRUSTRATION. WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE THE SHUTTER WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES, IT IS FRIGHTENING. VEHICLES SHOULD NOT MAKE YOU FEEL UNSAFE, ESPECIALLY A NEW ONE. WHY CAN'T DODGE REMEDY THIS PROBLEM AND WHY IF THEY HAVE KNOWN OF THIS PROBLEM, WHY DID THEY NOT INFORM ME OF THIS WHEN I BOUGHT THIS TRUCK TWO MONTHS AGO? I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE AND ALL THE DEALER CAN DO IS LET ME KNOW WHEN DODGE HAS ISSUED A KIT TO FIX THE PROBLEM. SO MUCH FOR CUSTOMER CARE!  *NM",
