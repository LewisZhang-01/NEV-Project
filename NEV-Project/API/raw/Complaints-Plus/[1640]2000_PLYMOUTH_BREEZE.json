AT THAT POINT I YELL AT EVERYONE TO GET AWAY FROM MY CAR AND I CALL 911.  WE MOVE THE NEAREST VEHICLES AND EVERYONE GETS BACK TO THE HOUSE.  TWO OF MY FRIENDS TRY TO RUSH BACK OUT TO OPEN THE HOOD AGAIN AND THE RADIATOR EXPLODES.  AGAIN, I YELL THAT I HAVE INSURANCE ON THE CAR AND FOR EVERYONE TO GET THE HELL AWAY FROM IT.     WITHIN MINUTES, ROLLING FLAMES HAVE ENGULFED MY CAR, AND WITH NOTHING ELSE WE CAN DO BUT WAIT FOR THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, I ASK MY FRIEND ARON (WHO OWNS THE HOUSE THERE) TO GET HIS CAMERA.
