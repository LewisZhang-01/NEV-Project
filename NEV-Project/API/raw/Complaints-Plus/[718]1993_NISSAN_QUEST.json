        "summary": "I PURCHASED 4 YOKOHAMA AEGIS GS4 P215/70R-15 97S TIRES (SERIAL NO. CC608HN428) AT DISCOUNT TIRE IN MIDLAND, TX ON DECEMBER 18, 1998.  THE TIRES HAVE BEEN ROTATED EVERY 6,000-8,000 MILES AND HAVE BEEN PROPERLY INFLATED.  MOST OF THE DRIVING ON THESE TIRES HAS BEEN IN TEXAS AND OTHER SOUTHERN STATES.  IN AUGUST, 2000 THE TIRE MOUNTED ON THE LEFT REAR WHEEL SEPARATED AFTER 32,000 MILES.  ON JANUARY 4, 2001 THE TIRE MOUNTED ON THE LEFT FRONT DEVELOPED CRACKS FROM THE EDGE OF THE TREAD TO THE SIDEWALL (SEPARATED?) AND WOULD NOT HOLD PRESSURE AFTER 37,000 MILES.  ON JANUARY 10, 2001 THE TIRE MOUNTED ON THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL FAILED WHILE DRIVING AFTER 37,000 MILES.  THE INSIDE SIDEWALL WAS COMPLETELY DETERIORATED (SEPARATED?).  ALL THREE TIRES WERE REPLACED BY DISCOUNT TIRE UNDER THEIR WARRANTY WITH A COMPETING BRAND OF TIRE FOR $20-27/EACH.  IT SEEMS A 75% FAILURE RATE IS NOT VERY GOOD AND I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.*AK (DOT NUMBER: CC608HN428  TIRESIZE: P215/70R15)",
