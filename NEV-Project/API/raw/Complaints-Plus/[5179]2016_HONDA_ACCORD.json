WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR WAS THAT I BOUGHT IT AT A MAJOR WORLD DEALERSHIP IN LONG ISLAND CITY, WHICH THEY TOLD ME THAT THE CAR DID NOT HAVE AN ACCIDENT OR TOTAL LOSS REPORT, WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE A LIE AFTER A FEW MONTHS  WITH THE CAR.  I NOTICED THAT THE CAR HAS TOTAL DAMAGE.  HEY, IT EVEN HAS PART FROM ANOTHER VEHICLE.  I'VE TRIED TO GET HIM TO HELP ME, BUT HE SAYS IT DOESN'T HAVE TO DO WITH THE CAR ANYMORE.  THEY ALSO CHARGED ME A GUARANTEE OF 3,000 DOLLARS AND THEY DO NOT WANT TO COVER WHAT THE VEHICLE HAS IN CONCLUSION;  THE CAR HAS A DESTABILIZING REAR RUBBER, THE PART OF THE TRUNK ENTERS THE WATER, THE DOORS ON THE LEFT SIDE DO NOT BELONG TO THE SAME VIN NUMBER OF THE VEHICLE AND A NO NUMBER OF THING.

THERE IS A CHATTERING NOISE DURING CLUTCH ENGAGEMENT INTO FIRST GEAR FROM A STOP TO A ROLL. THIS IS DUE TO THE EXCESS RADIAL PLAY IN THE DUAL MASS FLYWHEEL'S ARC DAMPER SPRING MECHANISM. AFTER THOROUGH RESEARCH, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE SERVICE LIFE OF DUAL MASS FLYWHEELS, SPECIFICALLY THE ARC DAMPER SPRING MECHANISM, IS RATHER SHORT DUE TO THE DEFECTIVE NATURE OF THE DESIGN. THE CAR I DRIVE STARTED EXPERIENCING NOTICEABLE FAILURE WITH ONLY ABOUT 17,000 MILES ON THE ODOMETER. I AM AN EXCELLENT DRIVER, WITH YEARS OF MANUAL TRANSMISSION EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MANY CERTIFIED HONDA DEALERSHIPS ON LONG ISLAND, AND THEY ALL HEARD THE NOISES THE DUAL MASS FLYWHEEL WAS MAKING. HOWEVER, ALL CERTIFIED HONDA MECHANICS, DESPITE HAVING TEST DRIVEN THE VEHICLE, FAILED TO EVEN DIAGNOSE THE ISSUE AS ANY PROBLEM. OTHER MECHANICS WHO ARE NOT HONDA CERTIFIED AGREED WITH THE FACT THAT THE DUAL MASS FLYWHEEL HAS FAILED. DURING ALL PHASES OF DRIVING, THE DUAL MASS FLYWHEEL RATTLES REGARDLESS OF GEAR SELECTED (INCLUDING NEUTRAL) AND CLUTCH POSITION. EVER SINCE THE DUAL MASS FLYWHEEL FAILED (17,000 MILES), ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS REASONABLY WARM OUT (APPROX. 70 DEGREES F), RATTLING PERSISTS, AND THE CHATTERING I MENTIONED BEFORE PERSISTS. THE DUAL MASS FLYWHEEL CHATTERS EXCESSIVELY, AND IS ACCOMPANIED BY A VERY DELAYED ENGAGEMENT TIME FROM STOP TO A ROLL INTO FIRST GEAR. THE SYMPTOMS OF DUAL MASS FLYWHEEL FAILURE AND CLUTCH FAILURE MAY APPEAR SIMILAR, BUT THE WAYS OF DIAGNOSING THE FAILURES ARE DIFFERENT; THE CLUTCH SHOWS NO SIGNS OF FAILURE.

I WAS TRAVELING AT 60 MPH THROUGH THIS VERY DANGEROUS MOUNTAIN PASS WITH NO INTERIOR OR EXTERIOR LIGHTS IN THE DARK IN AN UNLIT RURAL AREA, CARS PASSING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED.  I PUT ON MY FLASHERS SO THAT APPROACHING CARS COULD DETECT MY PRESENCE AND NOT RUN OVER ME.

AT THE LAST SECOND, HE SWERVED INTO THE LEFT LANE.  TWO MORE CARS NEARLY RAN INTO ME SO I KNEW THE FLASHERS WERE NOT WORKING EITHER.  I HAD NO IDEA OF HOW FAST I WAS GOING BECAUSE I COULD NOT READ THE SPEEDOMETER.  TRIED TO ADJUST THE LIGHTS WITH NO SUCCESS. NO BRIGHT LIGHTS EITHER.  I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO EXIT AT A RURAL PLACE WITH A FIREWORKS STORE, BUT IT WAS CLOSED.  I TURNED OFF THE CAR; I WAS TERRIFIED.

SO THEY SAID THAT THE SOFTWARE IN THE COMPUTER NEEDED UPGRADE (STRANGE.. IT IS A BRAND NEW CAR. AND WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ONLY ONE CAR. IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE WITH OTHER CARS PRODUCED AT THE SAME TIME).    THIRD TIME - AS PER HONDA TECH, THEY REPLACED THE ACCELERATION KIT AS THEY THOUGHT THAT IS THE PROBLEM.     FOURTH TIME - NOW THEY THINK THE WIRING IS THE PROBLEM AND REPLACED THAT.    EVERY TIME, I DROVE THAT CAR TRUSTING THEM, I RISKED MY LIFE. I AVOIDED ACCIDENT 8 TIMES ON FREEWAY FROM BEING REAR ENDED. I DROVE INTO THE CENTRAL DITCH ON THE FREEWAY AND INJURED MY SHOULDER. I AM ON MEDICATION FOR THE PAST 1+ MONTH. I AM WORRIED THAT I DRIVE THIS CAR AND AM GOING TO DIE.",
