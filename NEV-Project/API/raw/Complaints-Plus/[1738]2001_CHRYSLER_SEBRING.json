THE INTERMITTENT PART OF THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN OCCURRING SINCE MY WIFE BOUGHT THE CAR NEW.     FAN BLOWER MOTOR WAS REPLACED TWICE, BLOWER RESISTOR BLOCK WAS REPLACED THREE TIMES.       IN TROUBLESHOOTING THE PROBLEM, I FOUND THAT THE CONTACTS OF THE POWER WIRE FROM THE BLOWER FAN TO THE BLOWER RESISTOR AT THE RESISTOR ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR DEVELOPED A HIGH RESISTANCE THUS CAUSING THE CONTACTS TO OVERHEAT.  THE CONTACTS OVERHEATED TO THE POINT OF MELTING BOTH SIDES THE CONNECTOR'S PLASTIC TOGETHER.  IN ORDER TO REPLACE THE RESISTOR, I HAD TO BREAK THE PLASTIC OF THE RESISTOR CONNECTOR IN ORDER TO REMOVE IT.  FURTHER EXAMINATION REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF A SMOKE TRAIL COMING FROM THE PIN 1 (POWER WIRE) SIDE OF THE CONNECTOR.  SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE, I THOUGHT I DETECTED THE ODOR  OF A BURNING ELECTRICAL COMPONENT.         IF THE CONTACT HAD NOT CHANGED, THUS LOWERING THE RESISTANCE, A FIRE WOULD DEFINITELY RESULT.  THE MELTED PLASTIC OF THE CONNECTOR ENDS LEADS ME TO SAY THAT A FIRE DID OCCUR.  THE RESISTANCE WAS HIGH ENOUGH TO MELT THE PLASTIC, BUT NOT BLOW THE 30 AMP FUSE.    3.  THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR BLOWER RESISTOR WAS CUT OFF.  SINCE THERE ARE NO REPLACEMENT CONNECTORS AVAILABLE, I USED INSULATED FEMALE \"SPADE\" QUICK DISCONNECT TERMINALS CRIMPED TO EACH WIRE TO CONNECT THE BLOWER RESISTOR.  A SMALL DAB OF RTV SILICON WAS APPLIED TO EACH TERMINAL TO HELP LOCK THEM IN PLACE.  BEFORE REINSTALLING A NEW BLOWER RESISTOR, I ENLARGED THE HOLE TO THE AIR DUCT WHERE THE RESISTOR MOUNTS INTO.  THE ORIGINAL HOLE CUT OUT FROM THE FACTORY WAS TOO SMALL FOR THE RESISTOR TO EASILY FIT INTO.  THIS I FEEL CONTRIBUTES TO THE PROBLEM.    I HAVE KEPT THE OLD PARTS AS EVIDENCE. *TR",

ENGINE LOCKED UP AND WOULD NOT START. ENGINE RUINED. CAR HAD TO BE TOWED FROM HWY. CAR RAN PERFECTLY BEFORE GOING ON THE HWY. I HAVE SERVICE RECORDS TO PROVE THE OIL WAS CHANGED WITH SYNTHETIC OIL EVERY 3,000 MILES. I HAVE A RECEIPT TO PROVE I TOPPED OFF THE COOLANT PRIOR TO THE ENGINE FAILURE. MY EXTENDED WARRANTY DENIED THE CLAIM ON MARCH 3. I FOUND THAT EXTENDED WARRANTIES EITHER REJECT THESE CLAIMS AUTOMATICALLY OR PAY THEM AND THEN CANCEL YOUR COVERAGE. AFTER DENIAL, I RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM AND FOUND THAT THIS CHRYSLER MODEL HAS HAD NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS DUE TO ENGINE AND COOLING DEFECTS, INCLUDING THE ENGINE ITSELF, THE WATER OUTLET/COOLANT ARM, AND HEAD GASKET. ENGINE FAILURE HAPPENS FREQUENTLY TO CONSUMERS DRIVING 60 MPH OR FASTER (HIGHWAY CONDITIONS). CONSUMERS REPORT THAT THIS PROBLEM OCCURS DESPITE PROPER MAINTENANCE OF THE CAR. THERE IS NO WARNING PRIOR TO ENGINE OVERHEATING AND FAILURE. YOU DON'T KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM UNTIL SMOKE STARTS. MY CAR SMOKED LONG BEFORE THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE SHOWED RED HOT. THE HAND WAS STILL IN THE MIDDLE WHEN SMOKE FIRST STARTED. LOCAL MECHANICS, SALVAGE YARDS, AND EVEN CHRYSLER MASTER TECHS CONFIRMED THESE PROBLEMS AND THAT YOU CANNOT FORESEE THEM. CHRYSLER SHOULD HAVE ISSUED A RECALL REGARDING THESE PROBLEMS BUT NEVER DID. THE ONLY ENGINE-RELATED RECALL ACTUALLY ISSUED WAS FOR THE HARNESS FOR THE CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR. OBVIOUSLY, CHRYSLER HAS TRIED TO AVOID SUCH COSTLY REPLACEMENTS. A NEW, REMANUFACTURED ENGINE (WITHOUT THE ORIGINAL DEFECTS) COSTS AROUND $6200 IN MY AREA. MY PROBLEM CAME FROM CHRYSLER DEFECTS. CHRYSLER SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO INSTALL A BRAND NEW, REMANUFACTURED ENGINE AND ALL OTHER DAMAGED PARTS AT NO CHARGE TO ME.

TWO DAYS AGO I HAD IT IN AGAIN FOR A CAM SHAFT SENSOR ANOTHER $200.00 AND THE MECHANIC WARNS ME NOT TO INVEST TOO MUCH MORE INTO THIS POS BECAUSE THE RATTLING AND THE LOW OIL PRESSURE ARE PROBABLY A SIGN THAT THE ENGINE IS GOING. \"IT COULD BE TWO MONTHS IT COULD BE TWO YEARS BUT IT'S GOING GO.\" HOW ABOUT TWO DAYS.

THEY EVEN WENT AS FAR AS TO SAY THAT EVEN IF IT IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT THEY CAN'T BE HELD RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  SO BASICALLY I AM JUST REPORTING TO YOU MY COMPLAINT.

I HAVE CALLED THE DEALERSHIP, AND HAVE HAD IT IN THERE FOR INSPECTION, BUT THEY CLAIMED THEY NEVER FOUND ANYTHING. THE DEALERSHIP ALSO NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT THE RECALLS. I NOTICED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS CAUSING ME TO SPEED WITHOUT CONTROL, SO I TURNED IT OFF AND NEVER USED IT AGAIN, THINKING I WOULD TAKE IT IN WHEN I WAS ABLE, DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE DEALERSHIP FLUCTUATED BACK AND FORTH WHETHER I HAD 3-YEAR/36K BUMPER-TO-BUMPER, OR 7-YEAR/70K POWERTRAIN, ALTHOUGH IT WAS WITH MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SALESMAN OFFERED BOTH OF THE WARRANTIES.  LAST WEEK, MY SON WAS ASKING ME ABOUT THE CRUISE CONTROL AND HE TURNED IT ON. HE EXPERIENCED THE LACK OF CONTROL WITH THE SPEED. I TOLD HIM TO TURN IT OFF AND NEVER USE IT, AND THAT I WAS GOING TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT ASAP. THE NEXT EVENING, MY SON WAS DRIVING THE CAR, AND HE EXPERIENCED LOST OF CONTROL WITH THE ACCELERATOR. IN A PANIC, HE TRIED TO PULL THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, BUT ENDED UP CRASHING INTO A GUARD RAIL. I HAVE PHOTOS TO PROVE THAT THERE WERE NO TIRE MARKS OF ANY KIND AT THE SCENE: THE POLICEMAN CLAIMED THAT THERE WERE 90FT OF TIRE MARKS, BUT THEY HAVE NO PROOF, AND THERE WERE PARENTS AT THE SCENE AT THAT MOMENT WHO ARE WILLING TO TESTIFY THAT THERE WERE NO MARKS AT ALL. THIS PROVES TO ME THAT THERE WAS FAILURE WITH THE ACCELERATION AND/OR BRAKES. THIS MORNING, I READ IN THE PAPER THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER SEBRING INVOLVED IN A CRASH IN THE MIDDLE OF A ST.

THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD BE HARD TO FIND UNTIL IT MESSED UP MORE OFTEN SO THEY COULD SEE THE PROBLEM.  I HAD NO MORE PROBLEMS UNTIL DEC. 5TH ON MY WAY HOME FROM WORK..I STARTED HEARING A CLANKING SOUND THAT SOUNDED LIKE I WAS HAVING A FLAT TIRE SO I PULLED OVER TO CHECK.  THE TIRES APPEARED TO BE FINE.  I WAS ONLY A MILE OR SO FROM HOME SO I DROVE ON HOME.  ONCE HOME, I INSPECTED THE UNDERSIDE OF THE CAR AND THE WHEELS BUT COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING DIFFERENT.  THE FOLLOWING MORNING, WHEN I LEFT HOME, THE CAR SEEMED OK.  ONCE I ARRIVED AT MY FIRST STOP SIGN WHICH IS AT THE BOTTOM OF A HILL, I APPLIED MY BRAKES AND AGAIN THEY WENT TO THE FLOOR.  THE SECOND TIME I APPLIED THEM, THEY CAUGHT AND I STOPPED.  I TURNED ONTO THE HIGHWAY AND TRAVELLED ABOUT 150 FEET AND THE FRONT (SEEMING) LOCKED UP SIMILAR TO THE WAY IT DOES WHEN YOU PLACE A CAR IN PARK AND CUT OFF THE KEY.  I WAS HEADED TO THE RIGHT ONTO THE SOFT SHOULDER OF THE ROAD AND WAS FIGHTING THE CAR BECAUSE I WAS HEADED FOR THE DITCH AND AN ELECTRICAL GENERATOR ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  THE STEERING OR BRAKES (?) BROKE LOOSE, SENDING ME INTO AN ONCOMING PICKUP, THE PICKUP HIT THE FRONT OF MY CAR, THEN THE TRUCK HIT A VAN WHICH WAS FOLLOWING ME.  MY AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY, MY STEERING LOCKED AND MY BRAKES FAILED, ALL WITHIN 1 1/2 MILES OF MY HOUSE.  CHRYSLER HAS SENT AN INVESTIGATOR TO LOOK AT THE CAR TODAY, BUT EVEN HE SAID THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIND A PROBLEM THAT ONLY HAPPENS PERIODICALLY.

I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND SAW THREE SALES PEOPLE AND THEY COULD NOT HELP ME AND TOLD ME TO COME BACK ON MONDAY.
