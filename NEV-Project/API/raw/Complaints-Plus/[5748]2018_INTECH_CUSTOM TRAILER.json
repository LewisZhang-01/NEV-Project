THE WELDS ON THE ALUMINUM TUBE CROSS MEMBERS AND POST THAT MOUNT DIRECTLY TO THE FRAME HAVE ALL CRACKED. THE SCREWS HOLDING THESE PARTS TOGETHER HAVE ALSO STRIPPED OUT WHICH HAS LEFT THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY LOOSE ON THE TOP OF THE TRAILER. I NOTICED THE ISSUE ONLY AFTER UNLOADING MY KAYAKS OFF THE RACK COMING BACK FROM MY LATEST TRIP. I BELIEVE IF LEFT UNNOTICED, THIS HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR FALLING OFF UNDER LOAD AND WHILE TRAVELING DOWN THE ROAD CAUSING A HAZARD TO OTHER DRIVERS. I HAVE CONTACTED THE MANUFACTURER ABOUT THE ISSUE AND HAD REQUESTED THE CALCULATIONS THAT PROVE THAT THIS ROOF RACK SYSTEM IS SAFE AND APPROVED BY AN ENGINEER. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY REPLY OTHER THAN QUOTE FOR A NEW CROSS MEMBER AT MY EXPENSE.*DT*DT*JB",
