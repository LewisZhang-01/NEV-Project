        "summary": "On February 15th 2022 I experienced to failure in my powertrain system regarding the transmission center cable. I had my vehicle in park in a public lot and it began to roll away towards oncoming traffic. Thankfully I noticed and was able to get back into my vehicle and apply the emergency break before anyone was hit or injured when I looked closer I realized my gear shifter was in park but the dashboard read that my car was still in drive. When I tried to move the shifter It was completely stick in place and I had to get my vehicle towed to a Ford dealership. I spent $256.59 to have the transmission shifter cable replaced. In doing research on the issue I have learned there have already multiple recalls for this exact issue on 2016 Ford Fusion but when speaking to the dealership and looking on this website I was informed that my specific vehicle was not included in this recall therefore the repairs would not be covered. Also in my research I learned many other Ford Fusions who were not included in the recall have experienced the same exact system failure and safety concern. The Ford dealership that did the repair said it was the same part failure that resulted in the recall of the other vehicles. No warning lights messages or other signs appeared prior to the failure or notified me that a failure had occurred.",

He pulled over to side of interstate which happened three times from his work to independent car repair service.  Blessed he was not hit sitting on side of interstate or that engine didn't lock up potentially causing loss of control.  Both of these issues would have put my son at risk of death or bodily injuries.  Both Independent Car Service and Ford Dealership confirmed failure caused by engine head gasket flange design flaw allowing coolant into cylinder head.  This resulted in having to have the engine replaced which Ford declined to cover.  Ford has recently changed this flawed head gasket flange design to prevent coolant from entering cylinders.  It's difficult for me to understand why Ford or NHTSA hasn't taken action on this issue that can potentially put lives at risk.  There are multiple years of Ford Vehicle platforms and engines that have this same faulty design.  I have multiple children driving and I will make sure not to put them in a vehicle that puts them in potential harm. Regards",

The next day, I was leaving the parking garage, about to drive onto a main road when my power steering went.   I got the car towed to the auto dealership and it turns out that there are three recalls out on my car. One of which has to do with the steering bolts becoming corroded and the steering gear detaching and the the power steering going as a result. Yet the dealership is saying that the bolts are not corded so it is an internal issue. My car only has 66k miles on it \u2026 for the power steering to go while you are driving is very scary. It seems like this is a common issue and Ford is avoiding the issue with the steering gear by blaming it on just the bolts to the steering gear.

Took it to Ford and was told it had high resistance in my negative terminal in the battery. (First attempt August 2021) I was charged $400 to get the corrosion clean and put a coat on the terminal for protection. A week later my engine didnt start again. Had this problem for several weeks,one day the engine would start the next it wouldnt. I called Ford and was told to bring it back. (Second attempt Oct 2021) Ford told me they diagnosed the car and didnt find any codes to lead to the problem. Kept telling me the engine was starting when they had it but when i went to pick it up it wouldnt for me.

Leaving from work Monday night engine didnt start had to get it towed again to Ford Tuesday morning. I have called Ford headquarters to file a complaint. Do not purchase a Fusion they are terrible cars and Ford theirselves cant even find out what the issue is with the vehicle.",

My car told me that the engine was overheating while I was driving down the highway. I pulled off the road, and found there was no coolant in the reservoir. I filled the coolant up and kept an eye on it while scheduling a repair appointment. Every time I would drive the car, it would stutter when accelerating, only when it was cold. Once it warmed up it was not an issue. Every time I would also have to refill the coolant. I took the vehicle in, and found out it was misfiring on cylinder 4, and the coolant was leaking into the engine. Since it is out of warranty, it is $3,000 out of pocket. My car could have started on fire, or started smoking from the engine and caused a major accident had this gone on for too long. The misfire of the cylinder did not cause any warning lights to go on in my car. It would throw a code for a little bit, then disappear, it was a soft code not a hard code.",

A check engine light came on and a test revealed that the #3 spark plug or ignition coil as bad. I had all spark plugs and ignition coils replaced. The light went off and three days later the check engine light came back on. We took it to Bob Tomes Ford 950 S Central Expy, McKinney, TX 75072.  A Service inspection revealed that engine coolant was leaking into the cylinders and could potentially cause engine over heating and possibly a fire. This has been a known problem and numerous Service Bulletins (TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN 1.5L EcoBoost - Low Coolant, White Exhaust Smoke And/Or Illuminated MIL - Built On Or Before 06-Apr-2019 19-2139) have been released on this issue, A compete engine replacement is the only repair option due to the original engine design since 2010 was a defective design which Ford actually recalled in the 1.6L engine but not the 1.5L. Ford Motor Company requires the consumer to bare the cost of repairs. My vehicle warranty was out by 2 months when this problem started at 82,000 miles.

Not to the point where it has caused the breaks to lock up, but i'm still not comfortable with that.

I have reported this problem to my Ford Service Center, Southworth Ford in Marion, IN, as early as March of this year & the latest report 10/4/21, but they say they can't find anything wrong right now, but for me to document every time it happens, even after i have tried to show them the videos of this problem stored on my phone. I also contacted the Auto Safety Center, & they were the ones who directed me to you. I wish that i knew how to share the videos that i have with you, but i have not learned how to do that as of yet.

The dipstick also had coolant on it when I checked the oil level. The car has been at the shop since January 23rd, 2021, they tested the head and it was fine. When I noticed it was a serious issue, coolant was blowing out the tail pipes in white clouds. I have a short video of this happening.",

Attempted to shift through gear selector and back to park but the shifter handle would not move out the park position.  The following recall (18S20) has been issued but according to Ford it does not apply to my vehicle.  The bushing that attaches the transmission shifter cable to the transmission may degrade over time and cause the bushing to detach from the transmission. The condition could allow the driver to move the shift lever to Park and remove the ignition key, while the transmission may not be in Park, with no warning message or audible chime. Based on the number of complaints on this sight the recall affects most if not all Ford Fusions.  Paid for repairs, but Ford will not reimburse cost.  By the way parts totaled $7.64 small price for Ford to pay to protect its customers and the public.",

I tried to put the car in drive and it automatically went back into Accessory mode and flashed the same error messages telling me to stop driving. The steering was locked and unable to steer.   Had it towed to the Ford dealer. They let it sit for 4 hours and then called to say they could see no issue as it started just fine. The next day they called and said they saw the issue 3 different times and saw communication errors in the car computer. They cleared the errors and let it sit over the weekend. They called several days later and said they had driven it 25 miles with no errors seen.   I do not trust this car as safe on the road. If I had been on the highway, I would have locked up the steering and lost all power. It's not safe to drive until Ford finds the cause. I filed a complaint with Ford headquarters and was given a case number with high priority. The regional service manager is being enlisted to figure this out. I've alerted the sales director that I won't be buying another Ford until we find the problem. I've alerted other dealer executives to get involved.",

Take it to the mechanic, where they figured out that this consistent issue is due to a head gasket leak, where coolant is going into the engine. From doing research, I have noticed that Ford Fusions with an eco boost engine have a poor engine manufacture and that this issue is prevalent in most eco boost engines. The new fix seems to be ranging from $1,200, and I have tried to diagnose this issue multiple times. This isn't easily distinguished by the engine warning, and can run the risk of drivers driving with lower amounts of engine coolant. If the engine overheats it can make the engine catch on fire. Although this did not happen to me yet, it has been months to diagnose this issue, only to find out that it is due to the engine model, and that leaving it untreated can cause serious damage to me and the engine.",

They told us today they couldn\u2019t fix what was wrong unless the problem happened while they\u2019re driving it. 2 times now I\u2019ve narrowly avoided an accident because of the cars electrical system dying while driving it. This car is unsafe to drive as this happens randomly. Ford has been less than helpful at resolving this issue since we\u2019ve bought the car. We\u2019ve got several warranties on this car and it seems to be all for nothing. We also have video and picture proof of these incidents. Ford refuses to look at them stating they need the vehicle to do it while they\u2019re driving it after the massive amounts of codes are cleared.",

I EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THE MODULE IS FAILED, AND THAT REGARDLESS, A MODULE FAILURE SHOULD NEVER RESULT IN A CONNECTOR BURNING AS ALL THIS CIRCUITRY SHOULD BE FUSE PROTECTED AGAINST OVERCURRENT WITHOUT BURNING. I TOLD THEM THAT I BELIEVED THE MODULE APPEARS TO BE FAILED ON THEIR DIAGNOSTICS SYSTEM  BECAUSE THE GROUND TO THE MODULE HAS MELTED AND HAS THUS BECOME DISCONNECTED.     I COMPLETED SOME INVESTIGATION AND THE FAILURE APPEARS TO BE RELATED TO INSUFFICIENT GROUNDING TO THE SCME MODULE (SEAT CLIMATE CONTROL MODULE) UNDER THE PASSENGER SEAT THAT RESULTS IN OVERCURRENT TO A GROUND PIN TO THE SCME, WHICH RESULTS IN THE CONNECTOR MELTING AND BECOMING DISCONNECTED FROM THE SCME.  I AM CONCERNED DUE TO FIRE RISK IN THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT AS WELL AS ANY IMPACT THIS FAILURE MAY HAVE ON THE SEAT AIRBAGS.

WHILE LUCKILY THE STEERING GOT VERY BAD ON SIDE STREETS, THIS COULD HAVE RESULTED IN SOME SERIOUS INJURY OR PROBLEMS IF IT HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY I FEEL.  THIS VEHICLE IS JUST ONLY 4 YEARS OLD AND I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING THAT THE STEERING MECHANISM SHOULD BE FAULTY ALREADY.  I UNFORTUNATELY DO NOT HAVE WARRANTY ON THIS PART OF THE VEHICLE SO I AM NOW LEFT WITH A $2500 BILL TO REPAIR A SEALED RACK AND PINION ASSEMBLY THAT DOESN'T (TO MY KNOWLEDGE) REQUIRE ANY MAINTENACE.  HOPEFULLY THERE ARE ENOUGH OF THIS ISSUES TO WARRANT AN INVESTIGATION AND POSSIBLE RECALL.  THANK YOU,",

IT DID HAVE A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON WHEN THESE ISSUES OCCURRED AND SO I TOOK IT TO A SHOP TO GET THE CODES CHECKED OUT AND IT DESCRIBED HAVING A MISFIRE ON CYLINDER TWO. THE SHOP RECOMMENDED ME TO TAKE IT TO THE FORD DEALER FOR A MORE THOROUGH INSPECTION.  I MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO VISIT THE SHOP A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER BUT IN BETWEEN THOSE DAYS I NOTICED THICK WHITE SMOKE COMING FROM THE EXHAUST. THE ROUGH IDLING STILL PERSISTED AND I TOOK IT IMMEDIATELY TO THE FORD DEALER. AFTER TALKING WITH THE STAFF ABOUT MY ISSUE, THEY RAN A DIAGNOSTICS TO FIND OUT COOLANT WAS LEAKING INTO THE CYLINDERS AND CAUSING THE ROUGH IDLE AND THE WHITE SMOKE. I DID GET THE ENGINE BLOCK REPLACED BUT WHAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THIS ISSUE CAN OCCUR AGAIN. ANOTHER THING I NOTICED WHEN THIS ISSUE OCCURRED WAS WHEN YOU TRIED TO ACCELERATE THE VEHICLE, IT WOULD ACCELERATE SECONDS AFTER YOU PUSHED ON THE PEDAL.

AFTER THE REPAIR, MY CAR SAT IN MY PARKING SPACE AT HOME THE WHOLE WEEKEND DUE TO COVID-19. ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, JUNE 1ST, MY CAR ENGINE EXPLODED ON I83 WHILE MY HUSBAND WAS USING MY CAR TO GO TO WORK. MY CAR WAS COMPLETELY ENGULFED IN FIRE AND TOTALED. FORTUNATELY, MY HUSBAND WAS ABLE TO QUICKLY GET MY CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AS THE CABIN STARTED TO FILL WITH SMOKE AND JUMP OUT. KOONS FORD TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD \"SHRINK WRAP\" MY CAR AT THE LOT THE POLICE HAD IT TOWED TO AND BRING IT BACK TO \"INVESTIGATE HOW THE FIRE STARTED.\" THEY LIED AND THEN TOLD MY INSURANCE COMPANY THAT THEY DID NOT CAUSE THE FIRE. IN ADDITION, WHILE I WAS THERE WAITING IN THEIR LOBBY, THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD \"GET ME A RENTAL\" IN THE MEANTIME WHILE THEY INVESTIGATE. NOT ONLY DID THEY LIE AND IMPLY I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR CAUSING THE FIRE, THEY TRIED TO STIFF ME FOR THE COST OF THE RENTAL. ONLY AFTER I PUSHED BACK, THEY FINALLY PAID THE RENTAL BILL. MY INSURANCE COMPANY HAS PAID FOR THE COST OF MY LOST CAR WHICH I NOW AM BEARING ADDITIONAL COSTS IN MY INSURANCE COVERAGE. MY CAR HAD ONLY BEEN SERVICED BY KOONS FORD AND WAS NOT EXPERIENCING ANY PROBLEMS PRIOR TO THEM WORKING ON THE RECALL. I HAVE BEEN WITHOUT A CAR GOING ON 2 MONTHS NOW AS I CANNOT AFFORD TO TAKE ON ANOTHER 4-6 YEARS OF CAR PAYMENTS AS I WAS CLOSING ON A NEW HOME AT THE SAME TIME THE FIRE HAPPENED. I REACHED OUT TO FMC AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD HAVE SOMEONE FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE CONTACT ME WHICH ENDED UP TO BE YET ANOTHER LIE.*DT  *TR",

THIS IS AN ISSUE WITH MANY FORD FUSIONS AND THEY ARE REFUSING TO REPLACE MY ENGINE WHEN THEY KNOW IT IS A FACTORY DESIGN DEFAULT. IT IS GOING TO COST ME ALMOST 7000 WHICH IS RIDICULOUS WHEN ITS A DEFAULT IN THE ENGINE.  *TR",

SOME TIMES THERE IS A STRONG SMELL OF GAS FROM INSIDE THE CAR TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE TO PUT THE WINDOWS DOWN. WE'VE TAKEN THE CAR TO 2 SEPARATE FORD SERVICES & NEITHER HAS BEEN ABLE TO REMEDY THE ISSUE. WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE SOUND IS COMING FROM OUR REAR BRAKES TO BEING TOLD THAT THERE WAS WATER IN THE SPARE TIRE COMPARTMENT. THE ISSUE HAS BEEN CONSTANT STILL SO THERE'S NO WAY COULD IT BE CAUSED BY THOSE. WE'VE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE ISSUE SEVERAL DIFFERENT TIMES AT THE 1ST LOCATION AND ONCE AT THE 2ND LOCATION, WE'VE WENT ON TEST DRIVES & ALL THE TECHNICIANS HAVE HEARD & FELT THE NOISE, BUT BOTH LOCATION SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO ABOUT IT & WHENEVER I'LL PICK THE CAR BACK UP THEY'LL SAY THAT THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO DUPLICATE THE ISSUES. OUR MILES HAS NOW BEEN GOING DOWN WAY FASTER THAN USUAL AS WELL & OUR AVERAGE MPG HAS BEEN DROPPING SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THIS FIRST STARTED TO OCCUR. WE ALSO HAVE BEEN NEEDING TO FILL UP THE TANK ABOUT 3-4 TIME A WEEK NOW COMPARED TO JUST ONCE BECAUSE THE GAS JUST HAS BEEN DROPPING SO FAST & INACCURATE READINGS ON THE MILES WE'VE DRIVEN. THE SWISHING AROUND CAN BE HEARD VERY LOUDLY & FELT MORE IN NIGHT TIME DRIVING & ESPECIALLY WHEN BRAKING IN TRAFFIC & APPROACHING A STOP LIGHT/SIGN. THERE ARE TIMES AFTER PARKING, SHUTTING OFF IGNITION & EXITING THE CAR THAT THERE'S SMELL OF GAS HEAVY TO THE REAR OF THE CAR & I'VE ALSO OBSERVED THE SMELL COMING FROM THE OPENINGS OF THE REAR WHEELS. I'M AFRAID IN THE EVENT OF A REAR/SIDE COLLISION THAT THE CHANCE OF AN EXPLOSION IS MUCH HIGHER. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN SINCE SEPTEMBER OF 2017 & ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS TOLD A FORD SERVICE PERSON ABOUT IT TO NO AVAIL. I'VE CALLED FORD TO COMPLAIN IN DEC & FEB & ONLY SAID TO TAKE ELSEWHERE.",

WE CALLED EMERGENCY ROAD SIDE SERVICES AT 5:20 PM AND WAS TOLD A TOW TRUCK WOULD BRING US ANOTHER CAR WITH AN ETA OF 8:27 PM. FOUR CALLS WERE MADE UP TO 10:41PM TO FIND OUT WHEN THE TRUCK WOULD ARRIVE. WE WERE CONSISTENTLY TOLD THERE WAS A DELAY DUE TO HOLIDAY TRAFFIC. THE NEXT MORNING AT 8:03 AM, ANOTHER CALL WAS MADE TO DETERMINE THE STATUS OF THE ISSUE. WE WERE TOLD THE FASTEST WAY TO GET A CAR WOULD BE TO GO TO THE LOCAL BUDGET RENTAL LOCATION BUT WHEN WE ARRIVED WE WERE TOLD THEY COULD NOT GIVE US A CAR BECAUSE THE COMPUTERS WERE DOWN. AFTER MULTIPLE ADDITIONAL CALLS , THE SERVICE PROMISED TO BRING A CAR THAT AFTERNOON. FINALLY, 21 HOURS AFTER THE INITIAL CALL, A REPLACEMENT CAR WAS DELIVERED AND THE FORD FUSION WITH THE DEFECTIVE CHILD SAFETY LOCK WAS RETURNED. THIS WAS NOT ONLY A SERIOUS HAZARD FOR MY FAMILY, WE LOST A DAY PLANNED WITH FAMILY FOR THE HOLIDAY. AS A FORMER BUSINESS TRAVELER OF 11 YEARS, THIS WAS THE WORST CAR RENTAL EXPERIENCE AND I WOULD LIKE A FULL REFUND FOR THE TIME, DISTRESS, AND FRUSTRATION THIS CAUSED MYSELF AND DAILY. I SHUDDER TO THINK OF WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED ON THAT HIGHWAY AND I SUGGEST YOU ADD A MORE THOROUGH SAFETY INSPECTION OF VEHICLES PRIOR TO RENTING THEM TO YOUR CUSTOMERS.  *TR",

I SAY THIS BECAUSE THERE IS NO CURRENT RECALL ON THIS ISSUE. ON 9/03/2016, I WAS DRIVING ON WEST GEORGIA RD IN SIMPONVILLE SC WHEN ALL IF A SUDDEN THE CAR JERKED. THEN A WRENCH AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. I CAR STARTED TO LOSE POWER. LUCKILY, NO CAR WAS TRAILING BEHIND US OR I'M SURE IT WOULD HAVE RAN INTO THE BACK OF US. I SAY THIS BECAUSE MY FOOT WAS ON THE GAS PEDAL SO A CAR BEHIND ME WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN TO SLOW DOWN TIL TOO LATE. I HAD JUST TAKEN MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP THE WEEK BEFOR FOR A SECOND TIME DUE TO CAR STALLING RIGHT AFTER A TAKE OFF FROM A STOP. EACH TIME TO BE TOLD NOTHING IS WRONG AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT BE TURNED OFF. EACH TIME SERVICE PERSON SAYS BRING IT BACK IF CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STARTS BLINKING OR HAS A RED DOT BECAUSE SOMETHING THEN IS WRONG.   AFTER THIS INCIDENT I MAKE A FORMAL COMPLAINT TO FORD. A MANAGER CALLS ME AND I RETURN HER CALL. SHE ASKS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND I TELL HER. I ALSO TELL HER FORD HAD AN ISSUE. IT'S DANGEROUS TO DRIVE A CAR THAT AT ANYTIME MAY LOSE ACCELERATION WHILE DRIVING AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. I PRAY THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN TO MY FAMILY. I BOUGHT THIS CAR AFTER RESEARCHING IT WAS JUST AS GOOD AS A TOYOTA OR HONDA. SHE SUGGESTS I TAKE IT TO A DIFFERENT DEALERSHIP WHICH I SAY I ALREADY HAVE PLANS TO. BUT SHE ALSO SAY TO HAVE A TECHNICIAN RIDE WITH ME TO GIVE POINTERS ON HOW TO DRIVE TO AVOID THE STALLS. MY EXPERIENCE WAS NOT A STALL. IT WAS A LIST OF POWER WHILE DRIVING A CAR I PURCHASED NEW LESS THAN A YEAR AGO. THE 2ND DEALERSHIP SAYS IT'S A THROTTLE BODY ISSUE. IT CAN BE REPAIRED BUT APPOINTMENT NOT TIL 21ST. PLUS NO LOANER CAR. I HAVE TO WORK TO LIVE AND PAR FOR THAT CAR. FORD NEEDS A RECALL BEFORE THERE'S A DEATH.",

SHOULD I ALREADY HAVE THAT HUGE OF A PROBLEM?  ANSWER NO!  IF SOMETHING TO THIS EFFECT HAPPENS AGAIN I MAY SEE WHAT THE TRADE IN PRICE ON A 2016 FORD FUSION IS!

I ASKED FOR A LOANER. THEY SAID NO. I CALLED FORD CORPORATE IF THEY COULD BE OF ASSISTANCE( THEY KNEW OF ISSUES WITH THIS MODEL) THEY CLAIMED TO NEED A DIAGNOSIS      I WENT HOME AND CALLED  GALPIN & FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE. THEY  AT AROUND 3:00PM I WAS ADVISED BY  GALPIN THAT THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN REPAIRED, IT WAS \"JUST AS THEY THOUGHT\"-  A THROTTLE ISSUE .THEY CLAIMED TO HAVE DONE AN EEC TEST WITH CODE P2112 AND  REPLACED THE THROTTLE BODY.  I ASKED WHAT OTHER  DIAGNOSTIC TESTS  WERE PERFORMED AND WAS SAD TP SEE ONLY A BASIC \"REPORT CARD\" -FLUID LEVELS AND TIRE /BRAKE WEAR -  WHEN DRIVING THE CAR HOME, IT WAS NOT PERFORMING  THE SAME- NOT FLUID - A STRONG FLOOR VIBRATION NEAR THE ACCELERATOR, AND DRIVING VERY ROUGH. I CALLED GALPIN TO COMPLAIN INTEND TO BRING THE VEHICLE BACK TO THEM OR TO ANOTHER AUTHORIZED FORD DEALERSHIP AFTER I SPEAK TO FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE. I NEED TO HAVE THE VEHICLE THOROUGHLY INSPECTED BECAUSE I AM NOT CONVINCED THEY DID A THOROUGH INSPECTION BUT ASSUMED  BECAUSE OF PRIOR THROTTLE PROBLEMS, THAT WAS THE ISSUE.

I WAS IN THE PASSING LANE AT 75 MPH, CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY A TRACTOR-TRAILER SEMI, AND WE WERE PASSING TWO OTHER TRACTOR-TRAILER SEMIS IN THE ADJACENT LANE. OTHER CARS WERE IN THE VICINITY. SUDDENLY I NOTICED THAT THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL HAD BECOME UNRESPONSIVE AND THE CAR WAS SLOWING DOWN. ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL THERE WAS A WARNING LIGHT IN THE SHAPE OF A WRENCH. MY VEHICLE WAS SLOWING DOWN RAPIDLY AND THE ADJACENT VEHICLES HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS HAPPENING. HORNS WERE BLOWING; LIGHTS WERE FLASHING; AND THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING I COULD DO EXCEPT TO TRY TO SAFELY GET OUT OF EVERYONE'S WAY. THANKFULLY, I WAS SUCCESSFUL AND I WAS ABLE TO MOVE MY CAR TO THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY. THE REASON FOR THIS REPORT IS THAT IF I AND THE SURROUNDING DRIVERS HAD BEEN LESS CAPABLE AND LESS ATTENTIVE IN THIS EVENT, THERE COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN A HUGE CRASH AND AT LEAST TWO FATALITIES, AND NO ONE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THE ACTUAL REASON FOR THE EVENT. THIS WAS AN EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS SITUATION.    I WAS EVENTUALLY ABLE TO NURSE THE CAR TO THE FORD DEALER IN HARRISON, OHIO (CRONIN FORD INC) WHERE THE CAR WAS LEFT FOR REPAIR. ENTERPRISE PROVIDED A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE TO US AND WE CONTINUED OUR TRIP. LATER IN THE TRIP, I STOPPED AGAIN AT CRONIN FORD TO LEARN WHAT PROBLEM HAD BEEN FOUND.

I WAS DRIVING A FEW WEEKS AFTER THAT OCCURRENCE IN THE CITY AND THE CAR MADE A REVING UP NOISE AND I THOUGHT WHO CAR IS THAT I CONTINUED TO DRIVE AND NOTICED IT WAS MY CAR MAKING THE NOISE AND THE SPEED WOULD NOT ACCELERATE SO I HAD TO QUICKLY HIT MY FLASHERS SO THE CARS BEHIND ME WOULD KNOW MY CAR HAD STALLED. I HAD TO TURN THE CAR OFF AND BACK ON TO GET IT TO MOVE. I CALLED THE DEALER AND BROUGHT IT IN THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE ISSUE OR PULL CODES TO FIND OUT WHY THE CAR WOULD NOT DRIVE THAT DAY.  THIS SAME SCENARIO HAS HAPPENED TO ME ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND ONCE TAKEN TO THE DEALER THEY CAN NOT ASSIST ME. I HAVE NOT MADE THE FIRST CAR PAYMENT AND THIS CAR ALREADY GIVING MY PROBLEMS. I RESEARCHED THE CAR AND NOTICED CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE FOR YEARS NOW AND FORD REFUSE TO RECALL WHAT SEEMS TO BE A THROTTLE ISSUE AND THE CAR STALLS OUT WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE. I HAVE A NEW CAR THAT I  AM SCARED TO DRIVE SINCE THERE IS NO WARNING LIGHTS OR SIGNALS WHEN THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN IT HAS ALREADY ON 5 DIFFERENT OCCASIONS AND NOONE SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO RESOLVE MY ISSUE WHICH IS VERY DISAPPOINTING. I PRAY NO ONE HAS TO DIE OR GET HURT BEFORE THIS ISSUE IS ADDRESSED.",
