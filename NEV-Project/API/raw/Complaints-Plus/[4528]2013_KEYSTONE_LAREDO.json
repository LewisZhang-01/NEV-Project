I AM VERY MAINTENANCE MINDED AND THE TIRES WERE WHAT APPEARED TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION AND THE TIRE PRESSURE WAS CORRECT. THE TIRE MANUFACTURER SAYS NO TIRES NO CLAIMS. THEY DO NOT WANT ANY RECORD. HOW MANY PEOPLE KEEP A HOT, HUGE BALL OF WIRE WHEN THEY FAIL. THE COMPANY KNEW ABOUT MY LOSS THREE DAYS AFTERWARDS AND MADE EVERYTHING MY PROBLEM.  THREE OUT OF FOUR TIRES SUGGEST A TIRE ISSUE AND THE COMPANY WILL NOT LISTEN. AFTER I COMPLAINED ENOUGH THEY SAID SEND IN THE GOOD TIRE AND THEY WILL LOOK AT IT. NO ONE EVEN INTERVIEWED ME TO SEE WHAT WENT ON. THEY DON'T WANT TO KNOW BECAUSE YOU GUYS MIGHT MAKE THEM PULL SOME TIRES. WHEN THESE TIRES BLOW AT 65 MPH THEY ARE DANGEROUS. ..UPDATED 10/27/15*BF",
