I ASKED WHAT PARTS REQUIRED INSPECTION AND SHE SAID MY SHOCKS .I TOLD HER THOSE DON'T ATTACH TO THE CONTRO[ ARM SHE THEN SAID THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO CHECK MY CONTROL ARMS AND CHECK THE VIN TO VERIFY I HAD NOT GONE TO A JUNK YARD AND REPLACED THEM MYSELF.

THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO INTERPRET  THIS CONVERSATION OTHER THAN, \"WE NEED TO INSPECT YOUR VEHICLE AND REPLACE PARTS AT YOUR EXPENSE TO MINIMIZE DAMAGE TO OUR BOTTOM LINE.\" I ASKED TO SPEAK TO HER SUPERVISOR AND  DEBBIE STATE SHE DID NOT HAVE ONE, NO ONE ABOVE HER.

I PURCHASED MY JEEP LIBERTY NEW AND I'VE BEEN VERY HAPPY WITH IT.  I USE MY VEHICLE TO GO TO WORK AND I WORK NIGHTS SO IT'S IMPERATIVE IT'S SAFE AND IN GOOD WORKING ORDER.  I'M VERY CONCERNED AND I'M CONTEMPLATING GETTING RID OF IT EVEN THOUGH I LOVE IT, BUT MY PERSONAL SAFETY IS #1.....UPDATED 10/20/15 *BF",

THIS MADE THE CAR ACCELERATE.  I COULD NOT STOP AT THE STOP SIGN AND THE CAR ACCELERATED INTO 50 MPH CROSS TRAFFIC.  I MADE A HARD RIGHT TURN TO BRING THE CAR NEXT TO THE CURB, ALLOWING ROOM FOR TRAFFIC TO GO BY.  AT THE SAME TIME, I PUT THE TRANSMISSION INTO NEUTRAL AND THAT ALLOWED THE CAR TO STOP.  I THEN PUT THE CAR INTO PARK AND REVVED THE ENGINE.  IT SEEMED TO RESPOND NORMALLY AT THAT POINT (ENGINE WOULD RETURN TO IDLE IMMEDIATELY AFTER TAKING MY FOOT OFF THE GAS).  AFTER SHIFTING BETWEEN PART TO DRIVE, THEN REVERSE, ETC. SEVERAL TIMES, IT STILL SEEMED TO WORK NORMALLY SO I CONTINUED TO WORK WITH NO FURTHER PROBLEMS.   IT SEEMED AS THOUGH WHILE COMING TO A STOP, THE TRANSMISSION DID NOT DOWN SHIFT OR DISENGAGE.  AS THE ENGINE RPMS WERE REDUCED BELOW IDLE DUE TO THE CAR SLOWING, THE COMPUTER CONTROL SYSTEM TRIED TO BRING THE ENGINE SPEED BACK UP, CAUSING IT TO ACCELERATE.

WHEN I PURCHASED IT I HAD IT EXAMINED BY A MECHANIC AND HAD ALL THE HOSES, BELTS, ETC. REPLACED.  I'VE HAD THE OIL CHANGED AT ABOUT 5,000 MILE INTERVALS.  I DRIVE WITH ONE FOOT ONLY, I DON'T USE SEPARATE FEET FOR THE GAS AND THE BRAKE.  THE FLOOR MAT WAS NOT MOVED BEFORE OR AFTER THIS INCIDENT, AND IS NOT CLOSE TO THE GAS PEDAL.

IT IS IN NORMAL CONDITION FOR A 10 YEAR OLD CAR DRIVEN YEAR AROUND IN UPSTATE NY.  I AM SURE THAT THEY HAVE NOT SEE AS MUCH RUST ON VEHICLES IN ARKANSAS SO I THINK THEY ARE ANTSY ABOUT ANY RUST AT ALL. OR, THEY ARE LOOKING FOR ANY EXCUSE NOT TO DO THE REPAIR.  THE AMOUNT OF RUST JUST SPEAKS TO THE ORIGINAL DESIGN/MANUFACTURING QUALITY IF ANYTHING.   IT BEEN OVER 2.5 YEARS SINCE THE RECALL WAS FIRST ANNOUNCED AND OVER A YEAR TO THE POINT THAT THEY HAD ENOUGH HITCHES.  HE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET IN FOR REPAIR THE LAST 6 MONTHS.  I'M SURE 3 YEARS AGO THERE WAS LESS RUST ON THE FRAME BUT IT HAS TAKEN THIS LONG TO GET IT IN. IS JEEP OFF THE HOOK BECAUSE OF RUST? SHOULDN'T JEEP BE REQUIRED TO FIX THE PROBLEM ON ALL VEHICLES THAT ARE STILL ON THE ROAD?  SHOULDN'T THEY HAVE ANOTHER FIX IN PLACE FOR JEEPS THAT CAN'T ACCEPT THE \"HITCH\" FIX?     IT APPEARS FROM WHAT I HAVE READ THAT JEEP PURPOSELY DELAYED THE RECALL SO THERE WERE FEWER VEHICLES LEFT ON THE ROAD AND NOW THEY GET TO MAKE THE CALL WHEN THERE IS TOO MUCH RUST. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FEEL THAT MY SON IS SAFE IF JEEP IS ALLOWED TO SAY \"PASS\" ON REPAIRING HIS VEHICLE.  WHO ALLOWED JEEP TO DECIDE IF A VEHICLE GETS THE FIX OR NOT.  WHY WAS JEEP ALLOWED TO HAVE A FIX THAT CAN'T WORK ON ALL VEHICLES STILL ON THE ROAD?

I PULLED INTO A SHOPPING CENTER ABOUT A 1/8 MILE AWAY, PARKED MY VEHICLE, AND GOT OUT TO INSPECT THE AREA I HEARD THE NOISE COME FROM. MY LOWER CONTROL ARM HAD ALMOST COMPLETELY SNAPPED. I DECIDED TO INSPECT THE DRIVER'S SIDE REAR LOWER CONTROL ARM, WHICH WAS CRACKING AS WELL.    I DECIDED TO LOOK UP ANY RECALLS ON MY MAKE, MODEL AND YEAR, AS I TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF MY VEHICLE AND FOUND THIS ODD. TURNS OUT THERE IS A RECALL FOR THE LOWER CONTROL ARMS, THE \"L27\" RECALL. I WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THIS BY CHRYSLER. I CONTACTED THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD BE TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP FOR INSPECTION; ALSO, IF I REQUESTED THAT MY VEHICLE BE TAKEN TO A DIFFERENT DEALERSHIP, THERE WOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL FEE.     IT WAS BROUGHT TO THE DEALERSHIP, AND IT WAS CONFIRMED TO BE THE RECALL. I ASKED IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER RECALLS, AND I WAS TOLD BY THE SALES REP THAT THERE IS ANOTHER RECALL, THIS ONE CONCERNING THE FUEL TANK, WHICH CHRYSLER WOULD INSTALL A FREE TRAILER HITCH FOR TO PROTECT IT FROM REAR END COLLISIONS. THE REP THEN INFORMS ME \"BUT WE DON'T HAVE THOSE PARTS, NO ONE REALLY HAS THEM, SO WE AREN'T DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW\". HITS ME FOR A $4,400 QUOTE FOR OTHER THINGS THEY FOUND WRONG.     I HAD MY CAR THERE FOR A WEEK, AND I HAD TO PAY FOR MY RENTAL CAR. I WAS TOLD BY CHRYSLER THAT IT IS UP TO THE DEALERSHIP TO OFFER HELP WITH THAT, WHICH THIS ONE DOESN'T. I TOLD THEM THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY $350 EXTRA TO COVER A RENTAL BECAUSE OF A RECALL THAT IS THEIR BRAND'S FAULT AND RESPONSIBILITY TO REPAIR. I AM LUCKY I WASN'T ON A HIGHWAY.

HAD I NOT BEEN ABLE TO EXIT THE VEHICLE OR HAD CHILDREN RESTRAINED IN THE BACK SEAT, THERE COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUS INJURIES OR POSSIBLY A FATALITY.

THE VEHICLE WAS LESS THAN 2 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME AND SERVICED REGULARLY. THE FINDING OF THE FIRE DEPT.'S INSPECTION WAS INCONCLUSIVE, BUT I WAS TOLD IN CONFIDENCE THAT IT SEEMED MORE THAN LIKELY IT WAS A FAULTY ISSUE WITH THE VEHICLE.

IT WAS FINE JUST THE NIGHT BEFORE WITH NO INDICATION OF A PROBLEM, BUT IN THE MORNING I TURNED THE KEY AND ALL I GOT WAS A CLICK AT THE RELAY; THE STARTER NEVER ENGAGED AND THE ENGINE WOULD NOT TURN OVER. AFTER MUCH DIAGNOSIS IT WAS DISCOVERED THE PROBLEM WAS DUE TO THE END BREAKING OFF OF A SMALL METAL CYLINDER WHICH ROTATES TO ENGAGE THE STARTER; THE CYLINDER IS LOCATED ON THE LEFT UNDERSIDE OF THE STEERING COLUMN. I WAS INFORMED BY THE MECHANIC THAT THE CYLINDER, NOR THE HOUSING CONTAINING THE CYLINDER, IS SOLD AS A SEPARATE PART... I WAS FORCED TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE STEERING COLUMN ASSEMBLY TO THE TUNE OF $300 (THE LABOR WAS ANOTHER $200, AND A NEW IGNITION CYLINDER AN ADDITIONAL $30), TO FIX THIS ONE SMALL PART THAT PROBABLY COST ABOUT $5 TO MAKE. IN MY RESEARCH ONLINE, I FOUND THAT THIS IS A COMMON, WELL-KNOWN PROBLEM WITH JEEPS, WITH MANY PEOPLE COMPLAINING ON FORUMS ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE. THE ONLY ACTION I KNEW TO TAKE WAS TO FILE A COMPLAINT HERE TO HOPEFULLY INITIATE A RECALL OF THIS PART SO THAT IT EITHER A) IS REPLACED WITH A PART MADE OF BETTER MATERIAL SO AS TO STOP SO MANY FROM BREAKING, AND B) STOPS LEAVING PEOPLE STRANDED WITH A NON-WORKING VEHICLE WITH NO WARNING WHATSOEVER.          *JS",

THE ARMS LOOKED LIKE THEY HAD BEEN SITTING IN A JUNK YARD FOR 20 YEARS OR SO, THEY WERE THAT BAD!  WE CALLED THE LOCAL JEEP DEALER TO ASK ABOUT A WARRANTY OR EVEN A RECALL BUT WERE INFORMED THERE WAS NEITHER.  SHE GAVE US A NUMBER TO CALL AT CHRYSLER WHICH WE DID IMMEDIATELY.  WE WERE TOLD THE SAME THING THERE BUT THEY GAVE US A CASE NUMBER.  I DID FIND AN ARTICLE ON THE INTERNET FROM SEPT. 20, 2011 THAT SAID THERE WERE AT LEAST 11 COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME PROBLEM AND THAT IT WAS BEING INVESTIGATED BY NHTSA.

I WAS DESCENDING A HILL AROUND SEVERAL SHARP TURNS AT A RATE OF SPEED APPROXIMATELY 30 MPH ON DRY BUMPY PAVEMENT.    WITHOUT WARNING I FELT A VIBRATION WHICH SEEMED TO ORIGINATE IN THE REAR OF MY 2005 JEEP LIBERTY. SEVERAL SECONDS LATER A HARD THUMP WAS FELT UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR BOARDS ACCOMPANIED BY A METAL SCRAPING NOISE.  I IMMEDIATELY BEGAN APPLYING THE BRAKES TO STOP THE CAR TO INVESTIGATE BUT BEFORE I COULD BRING THE VEHICLE TO A COMPLETE HALT THE REAR OF THE CAR BEGAN TO COME AROUND TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE SUV FROM THE RIGHT. ONCE I GOT THE CAR COMPLETELY STOPPED I PUT IT INTO PARK, APPLIED MY EMERGENCY BRAKE, TURNED ON MY HAZARD LIGHTS AND THEN GOT OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE SITUATION. AS I EXAMINED THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE I NOTICED THAT THE RIGHT REAR WHEEL WAS OUT OF ALIGNMENT ALMOST TOUCHING THE BACK OF THE WHEEL WELL. I THEN SHINED MY FLASHLIGHT UNDERNEATH OF THE CAR AND SAW THE FRONT END OF THE DRIVE SHAFT LYING ON THE STREET. I COASTED MY CAR INTO A NEARBY DRIVEWAY TO GET IT OFF OF THE STREET.    I HAD MY VEHICLE TOWED TO THE NEAREST JEEP DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR. DIAGNOSIS: RIGHT HAND REAR CONTROL ARM FAILURE DUE TO EXCESSIVE EROSION/RUSTING. I HAD THE FAILED PART REPLACED AND AS A PRECAUTION I HAD THE LEFT HAND CONTROL ARM REPLACED AS WELL. BOTH OLD PARTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION.

AT FIRST I JUST ASSUMED IT WAS RELATED TO A PARTICULAR PUMP, BUT HAVE FOUND THAT IT OVERFLOWS NO MATTER WHERE I PURCHASE GAS.    I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON LIBERTY OWNERS FORUMS AND TALKED TO OTHERS WHO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. SOME HAVE HAD THEIR TANKS REPLACED, WHICH SEEMS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.    I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS DANGER, ESPECIALLY WITH 3 YOUNG KIDS OF AGES 7,5,2 AND IF GOD FORGIVE SOMETHING HORRIBLE WOULD HAPPEN AND CERTAINLY AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE ESPECIALLY WHEN SUCH EFFORTS ARE MADE TO EVEN CONTROL VAPOR EMISSIONS ON MODERN VEHICLES.    THE FIRST TIME THE TANK OVERFLOWED MY WIFE RELATES IT TO ME AS BEING SCARED,SURPRISED AND SOAKED HER LEG AND SHOES. WHEN TRYING TO PUMP GAS IT JUST LITERATELY JUST NOT EASY IT TAKES ABOUT 10 MINUTES TO PUMP HALF A TANK MANUALLY. THE STOPPING THE PUMP TO AVOID SPILLING GAS IS NOT SUITABLE LONG TERM SOLUTION.    I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE, BUT AM MORE ANXIOUS ABOUT THE SAFETY ISSUE THIS CAUSES, ESPECIALLY FOR MY WIFE AND KIDS. IT'S BAD ENOUGH DRIVING AROUND WITH THE SMELL OF GAS AROUND THE JEEP, BUT I HATE TO THINK ABOUT OTHER WORSE SCENARIOS SUCH AS A FIRE OR HAVING GAS SPRAYED IN SOMEONES FACE.

THE SAME THING ALL OVER AGAIN AND THIS TIME THEY DON'T WANT TO COVER IT AND OF COURSE THEY STILL FIX IT WITH THE SAME DANGEROUS  PART. IT NOW COSTS 400-500$ TO FIX IT. THOUSANDS OF JEEP LIBERTY OWNERS HAVE DEALT WITH THIS PROBLEM OVER AND OVER. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW CHRYSLER/JEEP  CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS BLATANT SAFETY ISSUE.  *TT",

ON ALL OCCASIONS, THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO A CHRYSLER, DODGE, JEEP DEALERSHIP AND WAS INFORMED THAT THERE WAS NO ISSUE. AFTER THE INCIDENT ON MARCH 11TH THAT DROVE ME OFF THE ROAD AND IN TO A DITCH, I CONTACTED THE JEEP CORPORATE OFFICES. MY CASE WAS ESCALATED TO A SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS TEAM WHO DISPATCHED A FIELD ENGINEER FROM JEEP. THE ENGINEER ASSESSED THE JEEP ON THAT FRIDAY AND TOOK PHOTOS FOR CORPORATE. AFTER ~5 DAYS, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT AT JEEP CORPORATE WHO INFORMED ME THAT, INDEED, THE ISSUE THAT I HAVE BEEN ATTESTING FOR THE PAST FOUR MONTHS WAS A CRITICAL ISSUE AND DID INVOLVE BRAKE CALIPERS AND ROTORS THAT WERE FUSED TOGETHER AND COULD LEAD TO A \"FIRE AND POSSIBLY AND ACCIDENT\" AFTER A RUDE CONVERSATION WITH THE AGENT WHO INDICATED THAT I \"WAS PISSY\", THE LEGAL DEPARTMENT INDICATED THAT IN ORDER TO RECEIVE REPAIRS, I WOULD NEED TO REMOVE ANY LIABILITY FORM JEEP BY VERBALLY AUTHORIZING THE REPAIR. THEY WOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION REGARDING THE CASE. SINCE THEN, JEEP HAS HELD MY VEHICLE AND WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY UPDATES.

I'VE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH MY JEEP UP UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO, IT HAD BEEN PARKED FOR ABOUT A MONTH WHEN ONE DAY I NOTICED THAT THE REAR DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW WAS DOWN ABOUT 3-4\". I TURNED ON THE VEHICLE TO DISCOVER THAT THE REGULATOR APPEARED TO HAVE GONE OUT. THIS IS ESPECIALLY ODD CONSIDERING THE WINDOW'S BEEN USED MAYBE 3 TIMES SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS NEW. NOW, SINCE I REFUSE TO PAY $300 TO FIX SOMETHING THAT THE MANUFACTURER HAS ADMITTED TO BEING DEFECTIVE (I.E. THEIR FAULT), I'M STUCK DEALING WITH A VISUAL IMPAIRMENT AND SECURITY ISSUE THAT COULD LEAD TO ETHER AN ACCIDENT OR THE THEFT OF THE VEHICLE ITSELF. WHEN DRIVING, AS I OFTEN DO IN MY VEHICLE, ESPECIALLY ON THE INTERSTATE, I NEED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER AND QUICKLY DETERMINE AT TIMES WHETHER OR NOT IT IS SAFE FOR ME TO MOVE OVER. THE FACT THAT THE WINDOW FALLS AT THE SLIGHTEST BUMP, NOT ALL THE WAY DOWN, BUT JUST ENOUGH SO THAT THE TOP OF THE GLASS PRESENTS A VISUAL IMPAIRMENT THAT CAUSES ME TO HAVE TO UNNECESSARILY MANEUVER TO TRY AND SEE. THERE IS ALSO THE MATTER OF OCCUPANT EXPOSURE TO THE ELEMENTS AND THE FACT THAT SINCE THE WINDOW WILL FALL FOR NO APPARENT REASON ANY TIME, DAY OR NIGHT, IN USE OR NOT, THIS PRESENTS A WONDERFUL TARGET FOR WOULD-BE THIEVES AND BURGLARS. *TR",

I HAD TO CALL TRIPLE A TO GET THE CAR TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP - GRAVA JEEP DEALERSHIP -  AND THE NEXT DAY, THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THE DEALERSHIP CALLED AND SAID THAT IT WAS THE LOWER BALL JOINTS - WHICH WAS A SAFETY RECALL FOR THE JEEP LIBERTY '05, AND BECAUSE THE LOWER BALL JOINTS HAD SEPARATED, IT HAD CAUSED RIM DAMAGE TO THE CAR, MAKING IT UNSAFE TO DRIVE WITH - AS IT WOULD DAMAGE AND DEFLATE MY TIRE.

HE TOLD US THAT THE FRONT END COMPONENTS ARE ALL GOOD AND SOUND SO HE SUGGESTED WE HAVE A FRONT END ALIGNMENT DONE. HE ALSO ROTATED THE BAD TIRES TO THE BACK AND BACK TO FRONT. AFTER INVESTIGATING THE RECEIPTS FROM THE PAST RECALL WORK THERE WAS NO FRONT END ALIGNMENT DONE AFTER THE LOWER BALL JOINTS WERE INSTALLED AT BILL LUKE IN PHX,AZ.. WE JUST TOOK IT AS IF THAT WORK WAS DONE AND NEVER QUESTIONED THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT A FRONT END ALIGNMENT AND THEY NEVER SAID ANYTHING TO US ABOUT IT. WE HAVE CONTACTED BILL LUKE WITH NO RESOLVE TO THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM THEY CREATED ON OUR JEEP. WE NEED TO NOW REPLACE 4 TIRES AND GET A COMPUTERIZED FRONT END ALIGNMENT ( APPROX. $ 850 ) AT THE COST OF  THEIR NEGLIGENCE. WE NEED HELP TO RESOLVE THIS MATTER PROMPTLY. ANY TIME ANY FRONT END PARTS ARE REPLACED A FRONT END ALIGNMENT SHOULD BE DONE. AND TRYING TO EXPLAIN THAT TO THE DEALERSHIP IN PHX IS VERY HARD. PLEASE HELP US GET REIMBURSEMENT FOR THIS PROBLEM THAT DAIMLER CHRYSLER CREATED. THANK YOU.  *TR",

I HAD DESCRIBED TO MY SERVICE TECH THE CAR WAS MAKING A LOUD SCREECHING NOISE WHEN TURNING AND THAT THE CAR HAD PULLED TO THE RIGHT OFF AND ON (EVERY FEW DAYS) WHILE I WAS DRIVING. THE MECHANIC STATED THAT HE FOUND A \"NORMAL NOISE\" RELATED TO AN AIR VALVE IN THE POWER STEERING, AND THERE WERE NO REPAIRS MADE TO THE VEHICLE.  I WAS OPERATING THE JEEP LIBERTY ON SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 3RD. I HAD THE VEHICLE IN PARK AT A DRIVE-UP ATM. WHEN I SHIFTED THE CAR BACK INTO DRIVE, THE FRONT TIRES GRABBED, THE CAR KICKED FORWARD AND THE STEERING WHEEL PULLED TO THE RIGHT. THE JEEP RODE UP OVER A CONCRETE CURB AND STRUCK A CEMENT POLE, SHATTERING THE PASSENGER'S SIDE FRONT WINDOW, RIPPING OFF THE DOOR HANDLE, CAUSING A DENT AND PAINT DAMAGE TO THE PASSENGER'S SIDE OF THE VEHICLE.   BEYOND THIS PROBLEM, THE JEEP HAS BEEN SERVICED FOR A BROAD RANGE OF MECHANICAL PROBLEMS AT LEAST SEVEN OTHER TIMES SINCE THE PURCHASE DATE (OCTOBER 2004). THE FUEL SENDING UNIT HAS BEEN REPLACED TWICE, THE VEHICLE HAS HAD TWO RECALLS, AND FOUR MONTHS AFTER I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE THE SENSOR WIRES HAD \"RUBBED THROUGH COMPLETELY\" ON THE TRANSMISSION.  RIGHT NOW, THE VEHICLE IS AT A BODY SHOP FOR REPAIR AND INSPECTION. IT WILL THEN BE RETURNED TO BROWN DAUB FOR A THOROUGH DIAGNOSTIC CHECKUP OF THE POWER STEERING AND/OR STEERING COLUMN. BEYOND THE STEERING ISSUE, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE CAR HAS 'KICKED FORWARD' - NORMALLY THIS OCCURS AFTER STOPPING ON WET ROADS (AT TRAFFIC LIGHTS)  MY MAIN CONCERN, AGAIN, IS THE STEERING ISSUE THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THIS ACCIDENT.

WE PUT THE TRANSMISSION INTO 1ST GEAR MANUALLY AND IT SHIFTS OUT OF 1ST AND INTO SECOND GEAR WHILE GOING DOWN STEEP INCLINES.  THIS CREATES A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE FOR US SINCE WE LIVE ON A STEEP INCLINE AND DRIVE ON SNOW AND ICE.  THE TRANSMISSION WILL START OUT IN 1ST AND THEN AFTER REACHING ABOUT 1200 -1600 RPM IT WILL SHIFT AUTOMATICALLY INTO SECOND GEAR (WITHOUT MOVEMENT OF THE GEAR SHIFTER) AND THEN SHIFT BACK DOWN TO 1ST AFTER 3600 RPM.  I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER, BUT THEY CLAIM THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A HILL GEAR.  I HAVE WENT TO THE CHRYSLER WEB SITE AND FILED A COMPLAINT ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE AND TELLING THEM THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE, BUT THEY FAIL TO RESPOND COMPETENTLY.  THEY CONTINUALLY TELL ME TO GO BACK TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP THAT TOLD ME THAT JEEP DOESN'T HAVE A HILL GEAR.   I INSISTED THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND THAT THIS VEHICLE IS MADE FOR FOUR WHEELING UP AND DOWN STEEP INCLINES AND THE TRANSMISSION CAN NOT COME OUT OF THE GEAR THAT WILL LET YOU SAFELY NEGOTIATE THE TERRAIN.  THEY RESPONDED WITH THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT.  WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE LIFE OF MY WIFE AND I HERE, BUT THEY DON'T CARE OR UNDERSTAND.  I HAVE OWN 4X4 VEHICLES ALL MY LIFE AND NONE OF THEM HAVE ACTED LIKE THIS.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS RUN THEIR COMPUTER DIAGNOSTICS ON THE TRANSMISSION AND FAILED TO FIND ANYTHING WRONG, BUT THEY FAILED TO TEST DRIVE THE VEHICLE.
