IN 92,000 MILES I HAVE HAD EIGHT BELT FAILURES.  EACH TIME ALL POWER ASSIST ON BREAKS AND STEERING IS LOST AND BECOMES NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO STEER OR STOP.  ON MY LAST VISIT TO THE DEALER THEY ESTIMATED $800.00 TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM BUT WOULD NOT GUARANTEE IT WOULD BE A PERMANENT FIX.  IN 1995 OR 96 I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM FORD MOTOR COMPANY ADVISING ME TO BRING IT IN FOR A SERVICE BULLETIN RELATED TO THE SERPENTINE DRIVE BELT PROBLEM.  AT THE TIME MY COMPANY HAD ME WORKING ON THE EAST COAST, BY THE TIME I RETURNED HOME IT WAS ABOUT TEN DAYS PAST THE EXPERIATION DATE FOR THE SERVICE BULLETIN.  THE LOCAL DEALER REFUSED TO HONOR THE SERVICE BULLETIN AS DID FORD MOTOR COMPANY.  FORD HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM BUT REFUSES TO FIX IT.  MY FAMILY HAS BEEN VERY LUCKY IN AVOIDING AN ACCIDENT TO DATE BECAUSE OF LOSS OF STEERING AND BRAKE CONTROL EACH TIME THE DRIVE BELT BREAKS.  ANY ASSISTANCE YOU CAN PROVIDE WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED AS FORD APPEARS TO BE UNINTERESTED IN CORRECTING THIS KNOWN SAFETY CONTITION. *AK",

HE RECOMMENDED THAT AN UPDATED BEARING AND SEAL SHOULD BE INSTALLED, THE DRUM TURNED AND NEW BRAKES PUT IN.  OF COURSE HE RECOMMENDED HAVING BOTH SIDES DONE, WHICH I APPROVED.

I DIDN'T THINK MUCH ABOUT THIS UNTIL THE SERVICE.  WHEN I PICKED THE VEHICLE UP I ASKED MR. BUTLER IF THIS WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM TO FORD AND HE SAID YES.  A SERVICE BULLETIN HAD BEEN ISSUED.  HE SAID THAT HE HAD TO MAKE THE BEARING AND SEAL REPAIR ON A REGULAR BASIS.  I DON'T HAVE THE SERVICE BULLETIN NUMBER BUT THE NUMBER OF THE SERVICE KIT IS F4TZ-1177-C.
