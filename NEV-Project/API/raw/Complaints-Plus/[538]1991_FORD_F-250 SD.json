THE TIRE WAS NOT IN USE AT THE TIME OF THE SEPARATION OF THE TIRE LAYERS. I HAVE 2 OF THEM AND ARE THE ONES I USE FOR SUMMER TIME DRIVING. TREAD IS ABOUT 50%.   THE TIRE BURST FROM THE INSIDE OF THE TIRE RIPPING AWAY THE TREAD AND LEAVING THE CENTER OF THE TIRE EXPOSED WITH THE CORDS EXPOSED AND INNER LAYER OF TIRE EXPOSED. I DO STILL HAVE THE TIRE AND WILL KEEP FOR A SHORT TIME IN CASE IT IS NEEDED FOR INSPECTION.   I ALSO HAVE PICTURES OF THE TIRE.",
