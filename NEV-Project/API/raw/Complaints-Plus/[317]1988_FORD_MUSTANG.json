THE ORIGINAL SWITCH AS WELL AS THE REPLACEMENT SWITCH IS MADE OF PLASTIC AND A LIGHT DUTY WHITE METAL THAT ARE CRIMPED ON THE ENDS TO CLOSE THE SWITCH. I FOUND THAT THE OLD SWITCH AS WELL AS THE NEW FAULTY SWITCH, BECAME SEPARATED. THE END CRIMPS SLOWLY BEND OPEN AND THE TOP OF THE SWITCH PUSHES AWAY FROM THE BASE.

THE INCREASED GAP BETWEEN THE CONTACT PLATES CAUSES AN OVERHEATING OF THE SWITCH, PRIMARILY AT THE BATTERY CONNECTORS, MELTING THE SWITCH AND HARNESS ASSEMBLY.
