THIS JEEP IS ONLY 7 YEARS OLD AND IS ALREADY IN NEED OF IT'S THIRD TRANSMISSION. I HAVE RESEARCHED COMPLAINTS ON THIS VEHICLE AND TRANSMISSION FAILURE SEEMS TO BE COMMON IN THESE TYPE OF CARS.

VARIOUS MECHANICS SUGGESTED I ADDRESS THE PROBLEM WITH JEEP/CHRYSLER DIRECTLY AS THE TIPM BECOMING FAULTY ON A VEHICLE IS ALMOST UNHEARD OF.  THIS FUSE BOX CONTROLS ALMOST EVERYTHING ON THE CAR.  AFTER GOOGLING THE ISSUE TO GAIN MORE KNOWLEDGE, I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THE AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS REGARDING TIPM ISSUES AND CHRYSLER; INCLUDING A CURRENT LAWSUIT AGAINST CHRYSLER ADDRESSING THE ISSUE.      WHEN I BROUGHT THE PROBLEM TO MY JEEP DEALERSHIP, I WAS TOLD THEY COULD NOT HELP ME AS THE CAR WAS PURCHASED PRE-OWNED WITH NO EXTENDED WARRANTY.  I REACHED OUT TO CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS TOLD VIA EMAIL \"TIPMS DO GO OUT ON VEHICLES AND IT WOULD ONLY BE COVERED UNDER 3 YEARS/36,000 MILES ON WARRANTY.  I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ASSIST YOU AT THIS TIME.\"    SO, WHERE DO I GO FROM HERE?  MY VEHICLE NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND I'M STUCK WITH A $1200 ESTIMATE (TIPM PART $800 PLUS LABOR).  MY MECHANIC ORDERED THE PART AND CALLED ME TODAY TO SAY \"IT IS ON BACK ORDER AS THIS PART IS IN HIGH DEMAND\"    I CANNOT BELIEVE JEEP CHRYSLER IS FAILING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AMONG ITS FLEET OF CARS.  CLEARLY THIS PROBLEM IS NOT A CHEROKEE OR DURANGO PROBLEM, IT IS A CHRYSLER PROBLEM.  TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND ISSUE A RECALL!",

THE POOR DESIGN OF THE HEADREST DOES NOT PERMIT THIS INEXPENSIVE PART TO BE REPAIRED OR REPLACED WITHOUT REPLACING MANY MORE EXPENSIVE, ELECTRONIC PARTS  3. JEEP PATRIOTS WITH PROBLEM HEADRESTS ARE ALMOST CERTAINLY LESS SAFE, GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE BRAKES AND/OR AIRBAGS MAY FAIL TO WORK PROPERLY (DUE TO MALFUNCTIONING SENSORS INSIDE OF THE HEADREST; THEY MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY, AS A RESULT OF THE HEADREST NOT MAINTAINING A PROPER POSITION)  4.
