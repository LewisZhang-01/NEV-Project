It works for one day then  completely shut off again, I can not see what gear I am in , any alert that I need to see for warning and saftey completely off in the cluster  . . Shortly after the first issue I noticed 2 cracks on my dashboard ,on both driver and passenger side of the vehicle . I had not put a lot of thought into that as it didn\u2019t seem like a safety concern up until I\u2019ve read several post of others with same issue . ( I\u2019m guessing a fire should be expected anytime because of others stories I have read off here the cracks have lead to fires ) Another issue is I have to add  quart oil to my Tahoe atleast every 2 -3 weeks . I\u2019ve taken it to have that fixed and each time was told there is no leak . I get the works done each oil change and still have to add oil 2 weeks after a new air filter oil etc .. a major issue that could have been a major wreck was While driving down a highway  around 11 pm .. my car started flickering lights inside and outside of my tahoe  and it started making a loud click sound saying system is shutting down ,my steering wheel locked up and all power to vehicle completely shut down .period . No power to anything at all what so ever . The battery was  fairly new . Well We had it towed back to town for a mechanic to look at the next day \u2026 he replaced the alternator and checked everything . Said he couldn\u2019t see anythjng and told me I should sale it right away  He warned me of a lot of issues  he keeps seeing with Tahoe . Well now my driver door will not open at all I have to crawl through the passenger side door to get in and out of my car . With all these serious issues still going on I m very scared to be in my car , not getting my alerts and being trapped inside . Please someone point me in the right direction I have 5 kids this is not safe !",

DURING THE 14 YEARS THAT GM HAS TAKEN TO RESPOND TO THE SAFETY PROBLEM MY DASHBOARD WHICH IS MADE FROM PLASTIC HAS SEVERAL CRACKS IN IT. I SPOKE WITH THE LOCAL DEALER AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY WILL REPLACE THE AIRBAG INFLATOR AT NO CHARGE BUT WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DASHBOARD WHICH WILL BREAK UP AND COME OUT IN PIECES ONCE REMOVED DUE TO DETERIORATION AND CRACKS. THE COST FOR THE DASHBOARD PARTS IS EXPECTED TO EXCEED $1,100.00. I THEN CONTACTED THE CHEVROLET CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CENTER AT 800-630-2438 AND SPOKE TO JECC WHICH INFORMED ME THAT NO, GM WILL NOT REPLACE ANY OTHER PARTS OTHER THAN THE AIRBAG INFLATOR. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW GM COULD BE SO COMPLACENT IN DELAYING FOR 14 YEARS THE INSTALLATION OF THIS CRITICAL SAFETY PART WHICH HAS PUT MY PASSENGERS AT RISK OF BEING IMPALED BE METAL SHRAPNEL IF IN AN ACCIDENT. I ALSO DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY AFTER DELAYING THE INSTALLATION OF THIS PART FOR SO LONG THAT THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO REPLACE ALL THE NECESSARY PARTS TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT. I WILL BE DELAYING THE RECALL PROCEDURE DUE TO THE HIGH COST OF THE REPAIR AND IN THE MEANTIME TRYING NOT TO CARRY ANY PASSENGERS. MY FATHER GOT A RECALL ON HIS 2013 FORD EDGE A FEW YEARS AGO FOR THE SAME ISSUE AND THEY REPLACED THE ENTIRE DASHBOARD WITH NO QUESTIONS ASKED AND THE DASHBOARD WAS NOT EVEN CRACKED. IT WAS NOT EVEN AN ISSUE. I WOULD THANK YOU IF YOU COULD PASS THIS ON TO ANY HIGHER AUTHORITIES AT GM.  IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT THEY DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT OR THEIR CUSTOMERS SAFETY.",

IT HAS TO BUILD THE PRESSURE UP BEFORE IT'LL START. MANY MECHANICS TOLD ME THIS IS A DEFECT. KAT FRIDAY NIGHT I RAN AN ERRAND. PULLED IN THE DRIVEWAY EXITED THE VEHICLE HIT THE KEY FOB TO LOCK THE VEHICLE. I GO OUT THE NEXT MORNING AND I CAN SMELL BURNT WIRES. THE WINDOW/POWER LOCKS/MIRRORS MODULE ON DRIVERS SIDE DOOR CAUGHT ON FIRE. LUCKILY IT SHORTED OUT THE MODULE, BUT IT BURNT UP AND MELTED ONE OF THE CONNECTORS. THIS JUST HAPPENED SO I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO FIGURE THE CAUSE. BURNS 2 QUARTS OF OIL BETWEEN OIL CHANGES. GENERAL MOTORS THREW ME UNDER THE BUS IN 1988 ON A BRAND NEW PICK UP TRUCK WITH THE DEXCOOL ANTIFREEZE THAT ATE EVERY GASKET OUT OF THE ENGINE AND THEY REFUSED TO REPLACE IT I REPLACED IT AT MY COST WITH NO HELP FROM GENERAL MOTORS. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH THESE PEOPLE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THESE PROBLEMS THEY GOT TOP DOLLAR FOR THESE VEHICLES. ALL OF THESE OCCURRED WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS SITTING STILL.

AFTER THIS CONSTANT ISSUE WAS \"REPAIRED\"-FOR 6TH TIME, A FEW MONTHS LATER, I EXPERIENCED A DIFFERENT PROBLEM. AFTER WAITING AT A STOP LIGHT, THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT ACCELERATE-I HAD TO PUSH GAS ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR, BARELY REACHING 20MPH, THEN, THE CAR STARTED SHAKING & TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THE BRAKES WERE BARELY WORKING. THANKFULLY, I WAS NEAR A PARKING LOT & WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER. THIS TIME I THINK IT IS A BCM OR PCS ISSUE. IT SEEMS THE \"FLEX-FUEL\" 4WD 2007 TAHOES ARE HAVING MAJOR ISSUES. THIS SHOULD BE CONSTITUTE UNDER LEMON LAW. I AM TOO SCARED TO DRIVE NOW-THE CAR HAS BEEN SITTING IN MY DRIVEWAY FOR A LONG TIME, YET I HAVE TO PAY INSURANCE & REGISTRATION.

THE ONLY TROUBLE CODES IT SHOWS WHEN HOOKED TO A SCANNER ARE A P0300 (GENERIC MISFIRE DETECTED) P0301 (MISFIRE CYLINDER 1) AND 0443 (EVAP EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM VALVE CIRCUIT).  AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF RESEARCH ONLINE, IT IS BLATANTLY OBVIOUS THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING THE EXACT SAME ISSUES. IT APPEARS THERE IS NO DIRECT SUREFIRE RESOLUTION.

I HAVE REPLACED THE BRAKE LIGHT CONTROL SWITCH, ADDED A SECONDARY BACKUP BATTERY AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CABLES, REPLACE THE PLUGS, PLUG WIRES AND IGNITION COIL PACKS.

IF POSSIBLE, I THINK THE VERY  QUALITY OF THE PLASTIC DECREASED SINCE PROBLEMS AROSE ORIGINALLY. MY DASH IS NOW CRACKED WORSE THAN ALL OTHERS PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED BY CHEVY, ALLOWING ME TO SEE THE THICKNESS QUITE CLEARLY, AND IT APPEARS MUCH MUCH MUCH THINNER THAN THE ORIGINAL DASH. NO MATTER WHAT, THIS IS WRONG AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. NOT ONLY CAN THIS EFFECT MY AIRBAGS, BUT THE SHARP EDGES AND NATURE OF THE PLASTIC ALLOWS FOR IT TO BECOME DEADLY PROJECTILES.  A $40,000+ VEHICLE SHOULD NOT HAVE THESE ISSUE. NOR SHOULD A $5 VEHICLE FOR THAT MATTER. CHEVY IS JEOPARDIZING THE LIVES OF NUMEROUS CUSTOMERS ALL IN THE HOPES OF SAVING MONEY - NOT LIVES!! PLEASE SEND CHEVY AN UNMISSABLE MESSAGE AND FORCE A RECALL. THIS WILL ONLY WORSEN AND INCREASE WITH TIME. DUE TO THE EXTREMELY POPULAR PROBLEM, THERE IS NO WAY CHEVY WILL BE ABLE TO DENY KNOWLEDGE AFTER SOMEONE IS KILLED. A LIFE WILL BE LOST DUE TO THIS. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WHEN AND HOW MANY.

IN FACT GM DIDN'T EVEN INDICATE THEY HAVE STARTED YET. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE TO ME AS A CONSUMER. NOW I'M LEFT WITH A CAR I PURCHASED NEW FROM GM AND AM NOT ABLE TO USE THE VEHICLE FOR IT'S INTENDED PURPOSE. ONE HAS TO ASSUME THAT GM DID THEIR DUE DILIGENCE WHEN PURCHASING THE AIRBAGS AND NOW THAT A RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED BY THE MANUFACTURER THAT DECISION IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR GM.

AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE GREAT TRACK RECORD OF MY OTHER CHEVYS IS WHY I PLACED CONFIDENCE WHEN PURCHASING THIS, MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE MODEL!  I REACHED OUT, IN PERSON TO MY LOCAL CHEVY DEALER, AND WITH LEG PROPPED UP, TIRED AND HOT LOOK ON HIS FACE I WAS INFORMED IT WAS NOT THEIR PROBLEM, THE VEHICLE WAS OVER 5 YEARS OLD.  ASKING TO SPEAK TO THE SERVICE MANAGER SEEMED TO REALLY INCONVENIENCE THIS GUY, SO AFTER A CLOSED DOOR MEETING BETWEEN MR. TOO HAPPY TO BE HERE AND THE SERVICE MANAGER, I GOT A VERY \"REHEARSED\" SPILL ABOUT HOW THIS IS AN OLD VEHICLE AND UNLESS GMC TELLS THEM TO FIX IT, THEY AREN'T GOING TO FIX IT!  EVEN THOUGH HE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM.  (FYI I NEVER LOST MY COOL AND WAS HOPING THE CORDIAL, BUSINESS MANNER I PROJECTED WOULD HAVE BEEN RECIPROCATED.....WRONG!)  THIS \"OLD VEHICLE\" HAS BEEN HAND WASHED, GARAGE KEPT AND KID FREE SINCE IT'S ORIGINAL PURCHASE, AND MAINTAINED WELL ABOVE THE MANUFACTURED RECOMMENDATIONS I'M SURE. AFTER READING A 135 PAGE FORUM OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE AS I, I HAVE AN OVERWHELMING FEELING OF BEING LET DOWN BY THE BRAND THAT I HAVE PURCHASED SINCE MY FIRST CAR, A 1986 CHEVY SPECTRUM.I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD IF I OR A LOVED ONE IS EVER IN AN ACCIDENT AS THE DASHBOARD CRACKS INTO HUNDREDS OF PIECES OF FLYING SHRAPNEL!HOW CAN THIS NOT BE A SAFETY CONCERN?  WHY CAN'T THEY REPLACE IT WHEN THEY REPLACE THE PASSENGER AIR BAG COMPONENT THEY ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING INTO REPLACING? WE HAVE BEEN TROLLING OUR CHEVY DEALER FOR A NEW TRUCK FOR MY SON OR ARE WE?",

AFTER RESEARCH I FOUND THAT THIS IS DUE TO A DEFECT IN THE DASHBOARD. SINCE THE DASHBOARD HAS NEVER EXPERIENCED AN IMPACT, IT MUST BE DUE TO THE HEAT LIKE IN THE MANY OTHER CASES. HOWEVER, I LIVE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ON THE COAST SO IT IS NOT PARTICULARLY HOT HERE. IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT THESE SHARP PIECES COULD SEVERELY INJURE A PERSON OR EVENT PUNCTURE AN AIR BAG. IN THE COURSE OF REGULAR USE A PERSON COULD BE BADLY INJURED BY THESE SHARP PIECES OR THE JAGGED SHARP EDGES OF THE HOLES IN THE DASHBOARD. I HAVE CONTACTED GM/CHEVY AND THEY SAID THAT AS OF NOW THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO TO HELP ME WITH THE $1,000 REPAIR, BUT THEY WILL LOOK INTO IT. ALSO, IF THEY DO HELP ME THEY SAID IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED \"GOODWILL\" AND IN DECIDING WHETHER TO HELP ME THEY WILL CONSIDER MY LOYALTY AND ASKED IF I GET MY CAR REGULARLY SERVICED AT THEIR DEALERSHIPS. I CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THE REPAIR COST AND I AM AFRAID IF I GET IN ANY ACCIDENT THAT CAUSES THE AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY THAT THE DASHBOARD WILL FURTHER SHATTER INTO SHARP PIECES AND PUNCTURE THE AIRBAGS AND/OR INJURE MY CHILDREN AND I. I ALSO FEAR SOMEONE REACHING UP ON THE DASH AND INJURING THEMSELVES. I HAVE SEVERAL GM CARS WITH MAJOR DEFECTS THAT COULD BE SAFETY ISSUES COSTING THOUSANDS TO REPAIR. GM'S DENIAL OF THESE POTENTIAL SAFETY HAZARDS IS JUST AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. GM'S NEGLIGENCE IN DEALING WITH SAFETY HAZARDS HAS COST LOYAL CUSTOMERS THEIR LIVES RECENTLY.

SECOND ISSUE IS THAT THERE ARE 2 CRACKS ON THE DASHBOARD; ONE IN THE AREA OF THE PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG, AND THE OTHER ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE DRIVERS SIDE STEERING COLUMN. THESE BOTH OCCURRED ABOUT THE SAME TIME, AROUND 100,000 MILES. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A WIDESPREAD ISSUE. GM NEEDS TO BE REPLACING THESE DASHBOARDS ON THEIR DIME AND NOT EXPECTING THE CUSTOMER TO FOOT THE BILL FOR THIS DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. IT IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE. SHOULD THE AIRBAG SYSTEM HAVE TO DEPLOY, PIECES OF PLASTIC WOULD BECOME PROJECTILES THAT WOULD HARM ANYONE INSIDE THE VEHICLE. THE THIRD ISSUE I HAVE, THAT BEGAN TODAY AT 109,000 MILES, ARE INVOLVING THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. THE SPEEDOMETER DID NOT WORK, THE LIGHT THAT INDICATES WHICH GEAR YOU ARE IN DID NOT COME ON, AND THE SEAT BELT LIGHT AND AIR BAG LIGHT WERE ON EVEN THOUGH I WAS WEARING MY SEAT BELT.

WHICH IS WHY I AM CONTACTING YOU, IF THIS IS HAPPENING IN MANY CHEVY/GMC CARS W/STABILITRAC THIS IS SOOOO DANGEROUS.TO HAVE YOUR CAR SUDDENLY REDUCE POWER TO 10-15 MILES PER HOUR (WITH NO BRAKE LIGHTS OR WARNINGS TO PEOPLE BEHIND YOU) IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.  *TR",

THE VEHICLE COMES NOT A DROP OF OIL IF THE ACTIVE FUEL MANAGEMENT IS TURNED OFF. EVERY SINGLE VEHICLE FROM GM THAT I HAVE TESTED HAS HAD EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION DUE TO THE ACTIVE FUEL MANAGEMENT FEATURE. AFTER THAT FEATURE IS TURNED OFF, NO OIL IS CONSUMED. 1 QUART OF OIL IS BURNED IS AS LITTLE AS 300 MILES. THIS CAN CAUSE THE VEHICLE'S ENGINE TO SHUT OFF AT ANY RATE OF SPEED DUE TO THE OIL PRESSURE CAUSED BY NOT HAVING ENOUGH OIL IN THE ENGINE. GENERAL MOTORS HAS TRIED FIXING MY VEHICLE AND OTHERS BY REPLACING THE LIFTERS, CAMSHAFT, PISTONS, PISTON RINGS, ETC..THIS FIX HAS NOT WORKED AND MANY VEHICLES CONTINUE TO HAVE EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION. VEHICLES AFFECTED RANGE FROM YEAR 2007 AND UP (PRESENT).    MY VEHICLE ALSO HAS VARIOUS TRANSMISSION ISSUES WHICH CAUSES THE VEHICLE TO SHUT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF MY DRIVING AND GREATLY INCREASING THE RISK OF AN ACCIDENT. GENERAL MOTORS HAS HAD VARIOUS REPAIRS BUT HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL. THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR GM SUV'S WITH THE 4-SPEED TRANSMISSION.    THE OIL CONSUMPTION ISSUE IS WAY MORE SERIOUS THAN THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED MORE BY THE OIL CONSUMPTION PROBLEM.

AND SINCE THE VEHICLE IS 4 YEARS OLD, THERE IS NO REASON (OTHER THAN CRAPPY WORKMANSHIP AND CRAPPY MATERIALS AND CRAPPY ENGINEERING) TO HAVE NOT ONE BUT TWO CRACKS ON A $50,000 VEHICLE!  SO I'M GUESSING WHEN MY AIR BAG FAILS ON MY PASSENGER SIDE AND WHEN MY DAUGHTER GETS HURT IN A WRECK BECAUSE THE AIRBAG DOESN'T PROPERLY DEPLOY, THEN IT WILL BE A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE I WILL BE ALL OVER GENERAL MOTORS.  THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT.  CHECK THE INTERNET.  HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME CRACKS HAPPENING.  GM IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND IS CHOOSING TO DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.  PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE AND HELP US GET THIS PROBLEM RESOLVED. *TR",

IN THE PROCESS OF ALL THIS & BEING INDOORS & THE HEAD LIGHTS WERE ON (AGAIN ENGINE NOT RUNNING) THE BATTERY RAN DOWN & THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT START. HE HAD TO USE A JUMP BOX TO START THE CAR.    DURING THE RUNNING OF THE ENGINE EVERY IDIOT LIGHT CAME ON & STARTED ONE AT A TIME TO GO OUT. AFTER I LEFT I FOUND THAT THE ONLY THING THAT WAS CHANGED WAS THE ENGINE HOURS RE-SET TO ZERO. I LOOKED ON-LINE & FOUND THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL BLOGS CONCERNING THE SAME AS I HAVE DESCRIBED ABOVE WITH THE SAME RESULT. SO I CONTACTED GM VIA EMAIL ON THEIR WEB SITE TO TELL THEM THE ABOVE. THEY CALLED ME BACK & CLAIMED THEY NEVER HEARD OF SUCH. THEY SUGGESTED I TALK TO MY LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALER & FIND OUT WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE. I EXPLAINED ALL THE ABOVE TO EDWARDS CHEVROLET IN BIRMINGHAM, AL. THE SERVICE MANAGER ASK IF ANYTHING ELSE WAS GOING ON BESIDES THE ENGINE HOURS? I TOLD HIM NO. HE SAID I SHOULD NOT WORRY ABOUT IT.    THE NEXT DAY THE GM MAN CALLED ME BACK & I TOLD HIM WHAT THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID & HE SAID OK BUT I PROBABLY NEED AN ELECTRONIC CONTROL MODULE (ECM) & I SAID I AIN'T BUYING NOTHING AS NOTHING ELSE WAS GOING ON WITH THE CAR.

I WAS TOLD THAT IT IS A KNOWN PROBLEMS WITH GM MODEL, I.E., TAHOE YUKONS SUBURBUNS. THE INTERMEDIATE SHAFT THAT IS INSTALLED WEARS OUT, AND HAS TO BE REPLACED, IN MODELS DATING BACK TO 98 AT LEAST. HE STATES I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR REPAIR. I RESEARCHED AN FOUND THAT HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS AND FORUMS ABOUT THE VERY PROBLEM BUT THERE IS NO RECALL ABOUT. THEY HAVE BEEN USING THE SAME SHAFT FOR YEARS AND NOW HAVE IMPROVED PART THAT CONSUMERS HAVE TO PAY FOR OUT OF THEIR POCKETS. HOW CAN THEY KNOWLINGLY PLACE BAD PARTS IN VEHICLES AND NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REPAIRING. I WAS TOLD THAT UNLESS THEY HAD A NEW FOR THE INTERMEDIATE SHAFT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED EVERY 10K MILES.  *TR",

HE SAYS THAT WITH ONLY 10,000 MILES IT IS NOT NORMAL FOR THEM TO BE GROOVED, AND IS DEFINITELY A DEFECT WITH THE CALIPERS PROBABLY STICKING.  SHOWED THE DEALER AND THE SERVICE WRITER STATED IT WAS NORMAL, THAT CANNOT BE NORMAL. SO NOW THEY RESURFACED THE ROTOR AND THE BRAKES ARE STILL SQUEAKING. AFTER BRINGING MY VEHICLE HOME FROM THE DEALER FOR REPAIRS THE CAR LOCKED \"ITSELF\" I DID NOT LOCK IT, THE CAR KEYS WERE NOT EVEN IN MY HANDS ANYMORE THEY WERE HANGING ON THE KEY RACK.

SECOND MALFUNCTION/INCIDENT WAS. I  STARTED THE VEHICLE AND THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS CAME ON BY THEMSELVES AND I COULD NOT SHUT THEM OFF UNTIL I RESTARTED THE VEHICLE. THE THIRD INCIDENT WAS THE SAME AS THE SECOND...THIS TIME I WAS DRIVING ON THE FWY AND THE WIPERS AND WIPER FLUID CAME ON AGAIN, I COULD NOT SHUT THEM OFF UNTIL I EXITED THE FWY AND RESTARTED THE VEHICLE.  WE TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AUG 23, 2006 AND EXPLAINED ALL THE MALFUNCTIONS THAT HAD OCCURRED THUS FAR THEY COULD NOT FIND NOR DUPLICATE THE HEATED SEAT PROBLEM BUT THEY DID FIND THAT THE WINDSHIELD WIPER MODULE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, SO THEY ORDERED IT. FORWARD TO TODAY SEPT 8, 2006 I WAS AGAIN DRIVING ON THE FWY WHEN MY XM RADIO WENT OUT COMPLETELY I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A PROBLEM WITH THE SATELLITE SO AS SOON AS I EXITED THE FWY I RESTARTED THE VEHICLE BUT THIS TIME ALL OF THE INSTRUMENT PANEL, RADIO AND ONSTAR SERVICES WERE COMPLETELY DEAD! NO SERVICE AT ALL! I CALLED THE DEALER AND THEY WANT ME TO TAKE IT IN SO THAT THEY CAN CHECK IT OUT YET AGAIN, AND INSTALL THE WIPER MODULE WE WERE WAITING ON.  THIS IS JUST RIDICULOUS, BEING THAT WE DID NOT PAY CHUMP CHANGE FOR THIS TAHOE FOR THAT KIND OF MONEY IT SHOULD BE A VERY RELIABLE VEHICLE!  I AM NOT GOING TO BE HAVING TO TAKE A $50,000 VEHICLE TO THE SHOP EVERY OTHER MONTH FOR MALFUNCTIONS...WHAT A COMPLETE INCONVENIENCE THIS IS!!

THE REPAIRS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE COMPLETED BUT EACH TIME THE SUV STALLED ON THE INTERSTATE CAUSING A POSSIBLY FATAL INCIDENT FOR MY FAMILY AND OTHER MOTORIST.
