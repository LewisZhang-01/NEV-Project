        "summary": "I AM EMPLOYED BY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER AS A JOURNEYMAN EQUIPMENT MECHANIC. ASE CERRTIFIED, GM SENIOR MASTER TECH AND FORD SENIOR MASTER TECH. THE DEPTARTMENT RECENTLY PURCHASED A LARGE NUMBER OF AUTOCAR MEDIUM DUTY TRUCKS POWERED BY CUMMINS ISL-G ENGINES. THE ENGINES ARE COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS(CNG) FUELED, SPARK IGNITION, ENGINES AND FLY BY WIRE THROTTLE CONTROL. THROTTLE RESPONSE DOES NOT MIRROR THROTTLE INPUT FROM THE OPERATOR. UPON INITIAL THROTTLE APPLICATION THERE IS A DELAYED RESPONSE OF APPROXIMATELY 1.25 SECONDS AND THE THROTTLE CONTINUES TO BE \"LAZY.\" WHEN THE THROTTLE IS DEPRESSED COMPLETELY TO WIDE OPEN THE ENGINE RUNS UP TO GOVERNED SPEED BUT WHEN THE THROTTLE IS RELEASED THE ENGINE CONTINUES TO OPERATE AT WIDE OPEN THROTTLE FOR APPROX. 1-2 SECONDS.  WE EMPLOY PROFESSIONAL DRIVERS THAT CONSIDER THIS DRIVING CHARACTERISTIC UNNERVING. FURTHERMORE NO MECHANIC ON STAFF FEELS THESE CAN BE SAFELY OPERATED.   HOWEVER THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE ENGINE(CUMMINS) AND THE CHASSIS(AUTOCAR) BOTH ADMIT SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT AND THAT THEY HAVE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER CLIENTS BUT EACH CONTINUES TO BLAME THE OTHER STATING COMPONENT AND OR SOFTWARE ISSUES. I BELIEVE IT IS A THROTTLE INPUT SAMPLE RATE ISSUE BUT HAVE NO WAY TO ALTER THOSE SETTINGS.  I AM ON THE COMMITTEE OVERSEEING THIS SAFETY CONCERN AND WE HAVE YET TO MAKE ANY HEAD WAY AFTER NUMEROUS EMAILS AND PHONE CONVERSATIONS TO THE MANUFACTURERS.  I HAVE REVIEWED THE FEDERAL MOTOR CARRIER SAFETY ADMINISTRATION, STANDARD NUMBER 124. ACCELERATOR CONTROL SYSTEM BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ACCURATELY COVER THIS ISSUE. I ALSO NOTICED THAT STD IS LIKELY GOING THROUGH A REVISION BUT AGAIN THOSE REVISIONS DON'T SEEM TO APPLY TO OUR ISSUE.  HOPING YOUR OFFICE CAN ASSIST US IN THIS MATTER.
