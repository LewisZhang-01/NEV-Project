        "summary": "I AM THE OWNER OF A 2008 WINNEBAGO SIGHTSEER WITH A WORKHORSE W18 CHASSIS WHICH WAS PURCHASED NEW IN 2009. ON 4/11/12, I HAD AN ABS WARNING LIGHT ON THE DASHBOARD THAT DISPLAYED AN INDICATION TO \"CHECK ABS!\" AND TOOK IT TO CHILHOWEE RV ON 4/14/12. AFTER INSPECTION OF THE CHASSIS AND FRONT WHEELS, CHILHOWEE DETERMINED THAT THE ABS SENSOR ON THE DRIVER FRONT WHEEL HAD BURNED OUT DUE TO OVERHEATING OF THE WHEEL. THE FRONT BRAKES HAD EXCESSIVELY WORN PADS AND A SCORCHED ROTOR, CALIPERS WOULDN'T RELEASE, AND BRAKE LINE WAS NOT RELEASING FLUID CAUSED BY A COLLAPSED BRAKE LINE AND/OR CALIPER DEFECT.  THE REAR BRAKES WERE INSPECTED AND FOUND TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE.  MY WORKHORSE WARRANTY DOESN'T EXPIRE UNTIL 7/7/12.  CHILHOWEE RV SUBMITTED A WARRANTY CLAIM TO WORKHORSE AND PROVIDED ALL NECESSARY EXPLANATIONS AND PICTURES TO DOCUMENT THE CLAIM. WORKHORSE CLAIMS OFFICE DENIED THE CLAIM BECAUSE OF OPERATOR FAILURE -- \"SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE DROVE DOWN A HILL WITH THE FOOT ON THE BRAKE\"; AND \"IT IS A DRIVER/VEHICLE OPERATION FAILURE AND AS SUCH NOT A WORKHORSE WARRANTY REPAIR.\"  THE REPAIRS WERE FINALLY COMPLETED ON 5/30/12 WITH A TOTAL COST OF $4,490.03. PARTS CAN ONLY BE PURCHASED THROUGH WORKHORSE WHICH AMOUNTED TO $3,418.70. IN THE END, WORKHORSE TURNED A $3,418.70 DEBT INTO A $3,418.70 PROFIT. THERE ARE PROBABLY THOUSANDS OF W18 CHASSIS IN SERVICE WITH THIS POTENTIAL DEFECT. YOU DO THE MATH ON HOW MUCH MONEY WORKHORSE CAN MAKE BY DENYING CLAIMS AND SELLING REPLACEMENT PARTS WHILE PUTTING LIVES AT RISK. THERE HAVE BEEN 31 BRAKE RECALLS ISSUED BY WORKHORSE OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS FOR W20/21/22 CHASSIS WITH EXACTLY THE SAME BRAKE PROBLEMS. THE REPAIR INVOICE FROM CHILHOWEE RV, WORKHORSE REGISTRATION OF MY RV, WORKHORSE WARRANTY STATEMENT, ALL THE E-MAILS BETWEEN CHILHOWEE RV AND WORKHORSE, PICTURES OF THE DEFECTIVE PARTS AND THE DEFECTIVE PARTS THEMSELVES ARE AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST.  *TR",
