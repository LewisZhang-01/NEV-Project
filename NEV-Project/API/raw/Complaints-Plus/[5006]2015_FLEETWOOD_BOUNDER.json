I'VE ENCOUNTERED A PROBLEM WITH THE EMERGENCY EGRESS WINDOWS (2 OF 3) IN THE COACH, WHERE THE METAL CLOSING MECHANISM DETACHES FROM THE WINDOW GLASS. THE WINDOWS ARE MANUFACTURED BY HEHR AND INSTALLED ON NUMEROUS FLEETWOOD RV PRODUCTS.  ONCE DETACHED, THE WINDOW MUST BE TAPED SHUT TO PREVENT WATER INGRESS INTO THE COACH, ELIMINATING THE USE OF THE EGRESS WINDOW FOR ITS INTENDED EMERGENCY EXIT FUNCTION. THIS IS THE ONLY SOLUTION, PENDING SOME TYPE OF REPAIR.    I'VE MADE NUMEROUS CALLS TO VARIOUS AUTO GLASS INSTALLERS, FLEETWOOD (REV GROUP) AND AN HEHR DISTRIBUTOR WITH NONE BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE A WORKABLE, VIABLE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. I'VE ATTEMPTED TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM WITH SUGGESTIONS FROM RV INTERNET GROUPS, BUT SHORT OF THE ORIGINAL ADHESIVE (WHICH NO ONE CAN IDENTIFY) REPAIRS ARE TEMPORARY AT BEST.    I CONTEND THAT HEHR (WINDOW MANUFACTURER) AND FLEETWOOD REV GROUP HAVE PRODUCED A SUBSTANDARD RV EGRESS WINDOW THAT PLACES THE RV OWNERS IN JEOPARDY. I FURTHER SUGGEST THAT THIS ISSUE EXTENDS FAR BEYOND JUST FLEETWOOD PRODUCTS BUT LIKELY INCLUDES MANUFACTURERS ACROSS THE RV INDUSTRY THAT USE HEHR RV EGRESS WINDOWS.*DT*DT  CONSUMER STATED THE ENTIRE LATCH DETACHED FROM THE WINDOW. AT THAT POINT THE LATCH COULD BE COMPLETELY REMOVED. HAD I NOT DISCOVERED IT, THE ENTIRE LATCH MECHANISM COULD HAVE FALLEN OUT WHILE DRIVING. *JB *DT*DT*JB*DT *AS",
