UPDATED 06/21/10 *BF  THE CONSUMER STATED THE BACK GROUND OF THE GAUGES ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL WERE BLACK AND THE POINTERS AND NUMBERS WERE RED.  IN DULL LIGHT AND AT NIGHT, WITH THE PANEL LIGHTS ON, EVERYTHING WAS VISIBLE.  HOWEVER, AS DAY LIGHT BECAME BRIGHTER,  THE ABILITY TO READ THE INSTRUMENT PANEL BECAME DIFFICULT. THE CONSUMER STATED THE PROBLEM IS NOT ELECTRICAL, HOWEVER THIS IS THE CLOSEST COMPONENT WE HAVE TO DESCRIBE THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. I ALSO CHOSE STRUCTURE AS A COMPONENT AS WELL, AS IT MAY JUST BE A DESIGN ISSUE. UPDATED 06/24/10. *JB",
