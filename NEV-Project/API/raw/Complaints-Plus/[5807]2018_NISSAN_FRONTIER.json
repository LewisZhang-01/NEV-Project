THE PAPERWORK SAYS 'PLEASE CHECK AND ADVISE FOUND DTC FOR VENT VALVE P0448 SERVICE BULLETIN NTB15-079.' THEY SAID MY VEHICLE WAS OVER THE 35K GENERAL WARRANTY MILEAGE.  I DID ONE MINUTE OF RESEARCH ON THE WEB AND FOUND A TSB AND NISSAN WEBSITE FOR THE WARRANTY ENHANCEMENT (15YRS/150K). I CALLED THE DEALER BACK AND SAID WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE TSB, THE NISSAN WEBSITE AND THAT THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR 15 YEARS WITH MULTIPLE MODELS OF NISSAN VEHICLES? NOT MUCH OF A RESPONSE EXCEPT YOU CAN CALL NISSAN.  I CALLED NISSAN AND WAS ASSIGNED A CASE MANAGER. THEY EXPLAINED THAT THE WARRANTY ENHANCEMENT WAS VIN SPECIFIC AND DID NOT APPLY TO MY VEHICLE. HE SAID HE WOULD REVIEW THE CASE AND GET BACK TO ME IN 4 DAYS! HE CALLED BACK AND SAID THEY HAD DECIDED NOT TO HELP ME AT ALL WITH THE REPAIR. SO, HERE I AM WITH A 2018 VEHICLE AND NISSAN WANTS ME TO SPEND $1600 TO FIX THIS ISSUE THEY HAVE HAD FOR 15 YEARS.

IT IS BETTER IF YOU TURN OF THE OVERDRIVE DID IT STILL HAPPENS. I HAVE HAD IT BACK TO THE DEALER 3 TIMES.DEALER REPROGRAMMED THE TRANSMISSION, REPROGRAMMED THE THROTTLE BODY AND THEN REPLACED THE THROTTLE BODY.   WHEN I PULL OUT INTO TRAFFIC I DO NOT KNOW IF THE TRUCK IS GOING TO MOVE OR NOT. SOMETIME THERE IS ABOUT A SECOND DELAY UNTIL IT CATCHES AND THEN SOMETIMES IT CHIRPS THE TIRES.    I HAVE JUST OVER 1000 MILES ON THIS TRUCK AND DO NOT FEEL SAFE.   THIS IS MY FORTH NISSAN FRONTIER, I NEVER EXPERIENCED ANY FEAR IN DRIVING THE OTHER TRUCK. I BELIEVE IT AND ANY OTHERS WITH THIS PROBLEM SHOULD BE RECALLED OR THE TRUCKS REPLACED.   THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM SINCE I BOUGHT THE TRUCK.",
