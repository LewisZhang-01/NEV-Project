Truck ran fine, did have the Hemi Tick startin until December 20,2021 and the CEL came on. Personally had my husband, CAT Certified Diesel Mechanic run the codes. To witch P062A Circuit \"A\" Fuel Pump Range/Performance Code was given.   Truck was parked and dealership, Vance Dodge Miami, OK was called. Truck taken on December 28,2021. Told the tech before hand while our daughters Nitro was getting fixed when he got my truck to go through it and make sure no other issues. Once truck was there few days later they called telling me that I had 4 broken Exhaust Manifold Bolts, needed another new battery, and CEL was on due to Fuel Pressure Switch failure. Picked truck up Jan 6, 2022. Did not even get out of city limits when CEL back on. Drove it 15 miles home. Changed the battery with brand new one. CEL back on, called dealership, requested Manager. Told to bring back in the following Monday. Truck back @ dealership Jan 10, 2022 just picked back up Feb 2,2022 to witch CEL IS STILL ON. after a month they fixed a 200 dollar connector behind the driver wheel and it still has not fixed the frickin issue. Now it's still throwing P062A code. Dealership acted as if they was beyond annoyed by me & my truck. Will yet again call them Monday. And now my exhaust is rattling that they just had off. I have paid out of pocket for all these repairs and they are getting beyond expensive and I'm not the only one with these issues. My truck has had all work done when suggested if not before. As well as the original owner who I know. My truck is not abused or neglected. I don't put cheap parts on it either, had I had been able to find ARP Manifold Bolts it would have gotten them ..  This is getting beyond ridiculous.. Something needs to be done I spent way too much money for my truck to have all these issues. BTW, my truck is paid for I owe $0.00",

The truck was empty except for me, and a few tools.  I had the cruise control set at 60 mph and was going up a slight hill when then truck suddenly and violently popped out of gear.  At first, I thought someone had hit me from behind.  Fortunately, there was nobody close to me and I coasted to the side of the road and stopped.  After a few minutes trying to calm down and read the truck manual--I never turned the engine off-- I followed the instructions to shift back to P (Park) and then select a gear.    I did this and the bell ringing and flashing lights stopped.  So I shifted to drive and took off again.  This time I did not use the cruise control--just slowly got back up to speed.  Then BOOM!  Once again, around 60mph about 4 miles down the road, the truck popped out of gear a second time violently and suddenly with no warning. Once again, I coasted to a stop and just sat there halfway freaked out.   Finally, I turned the emergency blinkers on and crept into Huntsville at 30 mph.  The next day, Sunday, August 29, I started the truck to see what would happen, and the Check Engine light was no longer lit up.  I phoned the Wischnewsky Dodge dealership in Huntsville, TX, and the Service Manager Chris Lovelady said I could bring the truck in and he would read the codes at no charge.  On Friday, September 3, I met Service Manager Chris Lovelady at 11am and he downloaded the codes.  I took a picture of the three codes (file uploaded below).  He said the significant code of the three was P0984 Shift Solenoid 5 Control Circuit Range/Performance.  He stated that since the codes were 'Stored' and not 'Active', he could not work on the truck--he said I had to drive it some more.  If this incident had happened on the crowded freeway in Houston where I live, there most certainly would have been a wreck.",

I was told they are wear and tare parts, but they didn't say anything about it seeming loose . I went for inspection and I was told that I need a new front end axel assembly kit that is 3000$ and they took my inspection sticker for it saying it is unsafe to drive until fixed that it could lock up and cause a accident. This sounded just like what the guy told me at 75000 miles. I was told it was bad at the dealer I bought it from at the time of inspection and when I looked up online it said the milage it is good for 80000 to 100000 miles. There has been no warning and I did not notice a problem so I went to a mini mechanic he gave me a sticker but I am noticing the axel being bad now. I am scared to drive my vehicle and if this is the case that it goes bad every 80000 to 100000 miles shouldn't it be recalled? The mini mechanic told me dodge did not design the axel to be protected from dabre and to keep it in better condition to take it off and grease it every once in a while. Yes my truck is available for inspection upon request . Thank you would like a clear answer on this soon where I have a child that I don't want to have put in danger or those around me.",

AT LEAST I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING ODD ABOUT THE WAY IT DROVE. THE CARFAX REPORT SAID IT HAD FOUR RECALLS, ONE OF WHICH WAS A FLASH/REPROGRAM OF THE COMPUTER MODULE.  IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE I NOTICED, LIKE OTHER RAM 1500 OWNERS, THAT IT SEEMED TO LURCH FORWARD WHEN COMING TO A STOP.

ANOTHER PROBLEM I HAVE, IS THAT THE ENGINE SOUNDS AND FEELS LIKE IT IS STRUGGLING WHEN I AM CRUISING AT ABOUT 1,200-1,500 RPM'S, AS IF IT IS IN TOO HIGH A GEAR. WHEN I HIT THE ACCELERATOR TO PASS OR SPEED UP, IT HESITATES, DOWNSHIFTS AND EVENTUALLY ROARS TO LIFE.    THEY KEPT THE VEHICLE OVERNIGHT. THEY DROVE IT AROUND.

WHEN I GOT THERE, THE SERVICE ASSOCIATE TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD \"RESET THE ADAPTATIONS AND UPDATED THE TRANSMISSION SOFTWARE.\" THE 'ADAPTATIONS' IS APPARENTLY SOMETHING THAT THE COMPUTER DOES TO ADAPT TO THE DRIVER'S DRIVING HABITS. THEY SAID THAT THE VEHICLE WAS 'USED' TO THE DRIVING HABITS OF THE PREVIOUS OWNER, WHICH IS RIDICULOUS. I SPOKE WITH THE TRANSMISSION TECHNICIAN, WHO ALSO OWNS A RAM WITH THE 5.7L HEMI. HE TOLD ME THAT HIS DOES THE SAME THING, AND THAT \"THEY ALL DO IT.\" HE SAID TO CHECK BACK IN A FEW MONTHS TO SEE IF DODGE HAS DISCOVERED A FIX FOR IT.

AS IT OFTEN DOES IN THE CAROLINAS, IT BEGAN TO LIGHT RAIN SO I ATTEMPTED TO SLOW DOWN MY SPEED. AS I DEPRESSED THE BREAK, I LOST CONTROL OF MY TRUCK, POSSIBLY DUE TO THE BEGINNING OF WATER ACCUMULATION ON THE ROAD, BUT MY CRUISE CONTROL WOULD NOT COME OFF AND I COULD NOT STOP. I ENDED UP RUNNING OFF THE ROAD, SPINNING 3 TIMES AND FINALLY STOPPING BACKWARDS IN THE TREES SEPARATING 95 NORTH AND SOUTH. DUE TO MY VEHICLE BEING TOO FAR TO TOW, I HAD TO DRIVE IT 200 MILES BACK AND WHEN I TOOK IT TO GET FIXED WITH MY INSURANCE ADJUSTER, THEY PULLED MY BLACK BOX WHICH SHOWED THE CODES C0051-28, C006A-62 AND U0415-00. I WAS INFORMED MY VEHICLE HAD ABOUT 9 RECALLS SUCH AS 18V332000 SO I HAD TAKEN MY TRUCK TO THE DODGE DEALER IN NOVEMBER OF 2018 TO HAVE ALL OF THE RECALLS FIXED. I WAS TOLD BY THE MECHANIC WHO FIXED MY TRUCK AFTER MY ACCIDENT, THAT THE CODES WERE SHOWING AN ISSUE WITH MY CRUISE CONTROL WHICH MADE SENSE, SEEING HOW I COULD NOT TAKE IT OFF OR USE MY BREAKS TO SLOW DOWN AND ENDED UP HITTING THE TREE LINE STILL GOING 75MPH AND COSTING OVER $13,600. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE MANUFACTURER KNEW THAT THE ISSUES ARE STILL OCCURRING.",

AS I WAS NEARLY ABOUT TO COLLIDE WITH THE VEHICLES AT THE TRAFFIC LIGHT/INTERSECTION AND FRANTICALLY PUMPING THE BRAKE PEDDLE , I FINALLY GOT THE BRAKES TO ENGAGE.  WHEN I FINALLY  CAME TO A STOP  , I WAS HAPPY TO NOT HAVE BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT AND KEPT DRIVING THINKING WHATEVER HAPPENED HAD FIXED IT'S SELF ( SUNNY DAY , AND DRY PAVEMENT ) . THE NEXT DAY ON MY WAY HOME FOR WORK I HEARD A GRINDING NOISE  FROM THE PASSENGER REAR WHEEL , AND PULLED OVER TO CHECK IT OUT . I NOTICED THE ROTOR SCORED BADLY,  AND THE OUTER PAD MISSING THE FRICTION MATERIAL , SO I  PICKED UP A SET OF PADS AND WENT HOME TO PULL THE WHEEL OFF AND INSPECT . NOW , I HAVE BEEN  A MECHANIC OVER 20 YEARS AND DONE WELL OVER A THOUSAND BRAKE JOBS/SERVICES ON HUNDREDS OF MAKES/MODELS OF VEHICLES , AND HAVE NEVER SEEN THE OUTER BRAKE PADS WARE OUT FIRST  . THE TRUCK HAS ONLY 38,000 MILES ON IT AND THE FRONT BRAKES HAVE OVER 1/4\" OF PAD LEFT  , AND THE REARS HAVE ABOUT  THE SAME , AND A BRAKE CHANGE IS A LONG WAYS AWAY  , SO I WAS CURIOUS WHAT I'D FIND . I FOUND THE CALIPER TO BE IN GREAT CONDITION , GUIDE PINS / RACES TO ALL BE IN GREAT  SMOOTH WORKING ORDER , AND WHEN I PRESSED THE PISTON BACK IN NOTICED GOOD SMOOTH OPERATION,   ALL DUST BOOTS IN GOOD CONDITION , AND NO LEAKING BRAKE FLUID ANYWHERE . I DID HOWEVER FIND THE INNER PAD ABOUT 1/2 DELAMINATED ( FRICTION MATERIAL-TO-METAL BACK PLATE ) AND AN OUTER PAD WITH THE FRICTION MATERIAL COMPLETELY MISSING . I CLEANED UP ALL SURFACES , APPLIED PROPER GREASE , AND INSTALLED NEW PADS BECAUSE ROTOR WAS IN USEABLE CONDITION BECAUSE I CAUGHT THE PROBLEM QUICKLY . I AM CONCERNED THE OTHER PADS ON THE TRUCK MIGHT FAIL AS WELL CAUSING AN ACCIDENT , INJURY , OR FATALITY , AND WANTED TO REPORT",

THE WINDOW DIDN'T MOVE AND I RELEASED THE BUTTON. THEN, WHILE PARKED IN A PUBLIC PARKING LOT, THE WINDOW WENT HALF WAY DOWN ON ITS OWN. I FOUND IT THIS WAY WHEN I RETURNED TO THE TRUCK. IT WENT UP WITH THE BUTTON AND I BEGAN MY TRIP HOME. DURING THIS TRIP HOME, WHILE I WAS DRIVING AND I HAD NOT TOUCHED THE BUTTON, THE WINDOW FELL COMPLETELY INTO DOOR.   APPARENTLY  THE WINDOW HAD COME APART FROM THE PLASTIC CLIPS HOLDING IT TO THE UP/DOWN MECHANISM.  TODAY, JANUARY 9, 2020, ANOTHER COLD DAY, MY WIFE PRESSED THE BUTTON TO NUDGE THE PASSENGER WINDOW UP (IT WAS OPEN JUST A TAD) AND INSTEAD OF GOING UP, THE WINDOW DROPPED INTO THE HALF WAY POSITION. WE GOT IT UP WITH THE BUTTON AND IT'S NOW TAPED IN PLACE UNTIL THE GARAGE CAN GET TO IT. THIS WINDOW TOO APPEARS TO HAVE COME OFF THE LITTLE PLASTIC CLIPS HOLDING IT PLACE   TODAY, I ALSO GOOGLE'D THIS PROBLEM AND HAVE DISCOVERED IT'S A KNOWN PROBLEM ON 2016 RAM TRUCKS WITH PAGES OF POSTS IN MULTIPLE FORUMS BEGINNING IN 2017 OF OWNERS EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM WHEN ITS COLD. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN SEVERAL WEB ARTICLES DISCUSSING THE PROBLEM. SEVERAL OF THE POSTS INDICATE THAT FCA HAS HAD MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE.  THIS SEEMS TO BE A SAFETY ISSUE FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST, ITS NOT PARTICULARLY SAFE FOR PEOPLE TO BE DRIVING AROUND IN STORMS AND FREEZING WEATHER WITH WINDOWS THAT JUST DROP INTO THE DOOR AND WON'T COME BACK UP. SECOND, ITS NOT PARTICULARLY SAFE TO HAVE THE WINDOW IN YOUR VEHICLE OPEN ON ITS OWN WHEN THE VEHICLE IS PARKED.

SINCE MULTIPLE PEOPLE USE THEIR TRUCKS FOR TOWING PURPOSES, THIS GREATLY INCREASES THE EFFECT AND EVEN FURTHER DECREASES THE PERFORMANCE THAT IS RELIED UPON. THE AEM SOFTWARE UPDATE SPECIFICALLY STATES \"THE AEM IS NOT EXPECTED TO CHANGE ANY OF YOUR KEY VEHICLE ATTRIBUTES, SUCH AS AVERAGE FUEL ECONOMY, RELIABILITY, DURABILITY, VEHICLE PERFORMANCE, DRIVABILITY, ENGINE NOISE OR VIBRATION, OR OTHER DRIVING CHARACTERISTICS.\" THIS DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT REMEDY REQUIREMENTS. DUE TO THE FAILED INSTANT ACCELERATION AS WELL AS TAKING UP TO 3500 RPM BEFORE FORWARD MOVEMENT CAN BE ESTABLISHED IN SOME INSTANCES HAS LED ME TO FORMALLY CREATE AND RECORD A SAFETY CONCERN THAT REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION. FAILURE TO DO SO PUTS OWNERS OF 2014-2016 RAM 1500'S THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THE AEM UPDATE AT RISK, NOT ONLY TO OURSELVES BUT TO THE OTHER DRIVERS AROUND US. BEFORE THIS UPDATE WAS CONDUCTED THERE WERE NO ENGINE/TRANSMISSION/PROPULSION RELATED ISSUES WHATSOEVER. LASTLY AS ANOTHER EFFECT BUT LESS IMPORTANT IS THE OBVIOUS DECREASE IN AND LOSS IN MPG. PLEASE HOLD FCA ACCOUNTABLE AND HAVE THEM ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BEFORE LIVES ARE FATALLY AFFECTED.",

ON 9/17/2016 IT WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE A BAD TRANSMISSION AND I WAS TOLD THAT RAM WAS REPLACING WITH A BRAND NEW TRANSMISSION, HOWEVER THERE WAS NOT AN ETA FOR DELIVERY.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE LOCAL REP WOULD FOLLOW UP ON THE STATUS AND NO ONE HAS EVER HEARD BACK FROM HIM EITHER.  I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE CORPORATE CUSTOMER SERVICE CASE MANAGERS AND THEY CAN NOT EVEN GET AN ETA FOR THE PART.  THE TRUCK ALSO NEEDS (2) RECALLS CORRECTED AS WELL.  II ASKED ABOUT A LOANER AND WAS TOLD UNTIL THEY HAVE AN ETA ON THE PART THEY COULD NOT PROVIDE A LOANER.  SO I AM NOT FORCED TO DRIVE A TRUCK WITH A BAD TRANSMISSION.  ALSO I WANT TO MENTION THAT THE TRUCK IS BEING REPAIRED UNDER THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURE'S WARRANTY.  MY EXTENDED MOPAR WARRANTY HAS NOT EVEN KICKED IN YET.  SO BASICALLY I HAVE A TRUCK THAT THE COMPANY CAN NOT GET A MAJOR PART UNDER THE WARRANTY.  I CAN BARELY GET OUT OF 1ST GEAR AND WHEN IT DOES I SUFFER A VERY HARD JOLT WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS.  I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT RAM IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR  THIS.",

WHEN I'M DRIVING AT SPEED ON THE HIGHWAY AND I GO TO PASS,WHEN IT PRESS ON THE GAS PEDAL THERE IS A LONG HESITATION AND THEN IT BOGS DOWN THEN ACCELERATES. IT'S SCARY MY WIFE GETS NERVOUS WHEN SHE'S DRIVING. THE LONGER YOU DRIVE IT THE WORSE IT GETS. I HAVE 9,500 MILES ON IT. AFTER DRIVING IT ON THE HIGHWAY AND YOU EXIT TO THE STREETS THE GAS PEDAL HAS A LOT OF PLAY IN IT-ABOUT 1.5 INCHES FROM WHEN YOU PRESS ON THE PEDAL TO WHEN IT KICKS IN AND THEN THE RESPONSE IS A BIT JERKY.   I BROUGHT TO THE DEALERSHIP ON 9/26/2016 AND THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T REPLICATE THE ISSUE. I EXPLAINED THAT THEY NEEDED TO DRIVE THE TRUCK FOR A WHILE. WHEN THE TRUCK IS COLD IT'S OK, NO ISSUES.
