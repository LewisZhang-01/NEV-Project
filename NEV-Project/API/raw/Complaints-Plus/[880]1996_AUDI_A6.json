SHE STATED TO ME AFTER THE INCIDENT THAT SHE HAD TO PRESS BOTH FEET ON THE BRAKE PEDAL TO GET THE CAR TO STOP. FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT AND SHE WAS ABLE TO SAFELY PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  I TOOK HER CAR TO FRIEND'S HOUSE, DROPPED HER OFF AT SCHOOL AND TOOK HER VEHICLE TO SUNNY SIDE AUDI IN MIDDLEBURG OHIO. THEY FOUND THE SPEED CONTROL WAS MALFUNCTIONING. THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD BE BETWEEN $800 AND $1000 TO REPAIR. I PAID THEM $138.00 TO DISCONNECT THE CRUISE CONTROL AND WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY CONTINUING PROBLEMS WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL.      THE $138 ISN'T GOING TO BREAK ME BUT THEN AGAIN BREAKING ME IS WHY I AM WRITING THIS COMPLAINT. I HAVE GIVEN THIS INCIDENT A LOT OF THOUGHT; WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED, HOW LUCKY WE ARE THAT MY DAUGHTER DIDN'T PANIC AND THEN I REALIZED THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN LIKELY MANY MORE 1996 AUDI A6'S OUT THERE AND WHO KNOWS OTHER AUDI'S IN GENERAL WITH THE SAME CRUISE CONTROL SET UP THAT IS INSTALLED IN OUR CAR THAT HAVE OR WILL MALFUNCTION.     I AM HOPING THAT SOMEONE WILL LOOK INTO THIS INCIDENT. YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME TO INSPECT OUR VEHICLE. I WAS SURPRISED BY THE RESPONSE OF THE SUNNY SIDE AUDI SERVICE DEPARTMENT. THEY OFFERED US NO SUPPORT OR AVENUE FOR ASSISTANCE FOR REPAIR AND TREATED THIS INCIDENT LIKE ANY OTHER VEHICLE REPAIR.
