I was able to guide the Explorer to an open space in the hotel parking lot.  I was totally frustrated and terrified because if the failure had happened just two minutes earlier I would have likely crashed at highway speeds!    So I was stranded in a new town 2 hours away from home with no idea how I was going to get home or how to get my Explorer diagnosed.  I had the Explorer towed to a nearby dealership.  (Midland Ford in Midland Michigan) to get it diagnosed.  In the meantime I had to find away to get my kids and my wife back home 2 hours away before Monday morning (School & Work) without a car and on a Sunday.  I was able to to find a way home but we arrived very early Monday morning.  I am now facing a repair job of $2600.

Then, last week I was driving on the highway through a construction zone late at night when a large black plastic piece(the trim molding on the other side of the windshield) flew off the passenger side and a two foot piece of thick gooey rubber was flapping on my windshield. Fortunately, there were no cars behind me as it occurred, because it startled me and I swerved a little bit & had to quickly pull off the road and ended up have to pull off the flapping/dangling rubber piece because it would not be go back on and was slapping tar on my windshield and body of the vehicle. Ford has advised they want nearly $1,100 to fix the issue which I see from numerous other posts, and from 3 other Explorers I\u2019ve noticed this last week alone in my neighborhood with the same exact defect problem. This is obviously a well known issue as per the numerous posts here, the comments from the two Ford dealerships I\u2019ve been to and a Safelite Auto Glass Repair shop who advised they\u2019ve seen many of these same exact instances on Explorers.  It\u2019s unbelievable that the NHTSA hasn\u2019t required Ford to do a recall on these, and it\u2019s despicable that Ford hasn\u2019t proactively offered to replace or repair these for owners, - but instead seems to have no problem gouging consumers on repairs that they tell them they need to pay for themselves!",

Had to yank the steering wheel to get it to return to normal steering. Made a popping sound when yanked. Didn\u2019t happen again but in September 2020 started noticing a lot of popping when the wheel would turn left or right at slow speeds. Took car to Meineke. They diagnosed need for new front struts. These were replaced at a cost of $1000. Popping stopped until about November 2020. Noticed it again only intermittently when pulling out of driveway and turning steering wheel far left or right. Would hear a single pop sound. From then until June 2021 would notice this intermittently and had steering bind up again probably 2 more times. Very terrifying to have to yank hard to get steering wheel to turn correctly when driving in traffic. Steering did seem a little loose as well. After reading about the hundreds of complaints about rack and pinions going bad on 2014-2016 explorers and seeing that my car\u2019s symptoms were exactly the same I knew this had to be the issue. I took the car to Meineke and they wanted $3600 to replace the rack and pinion which was way too much. Ford dealer at Oxmoor replaced for $1988. The car had 103,000 miles when the problems started. It had a certified preowned warranty through 100,000 miles so of course this wasn\u2019t covered but a rack and pinion should not fail in a 6 year old car with barely over 100K miles. And having steering that doesn\u2019t work is extremely dangerous. Ford needs to step up and take responsibility for this failure and do a recall in ALL explorers that are having this issue and replace the rack and pinions and reimburse those that have had to pay out of pocket for it. My father worked for Ford and I\u2019ve been loyal to this brand but after spending over $3000 on a car in a matter of 6 months that is barely 6 yrs old, I\u2019m done with Ford.",

We took turns standing under the rack and pinion electric steering box, if you placed your hand on the bottom/base, you could feel the hard thump when the wheel was turned as described above.

WE ALMOST CRASHED INTO THE VEHICLE NEXT TO US ON I-94 GOING AT A VERY RAPID SPEED OF 70 MILES PER HOUR.  IMMEDIATELY MY HUSBAND BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN AND TRIED TO MOVE TO THE FURTHEST RIGHT LANE.  HE WAS HAVING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DIFFICULTY AS OUR CAR WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO STEER.  HE FINALLY MADE IT TO THE EXIT LANE.  AT THIS TIME WE NEEDED TO PULL OFF OF THE HWY AND GET A FRIEND TO TOW US HOME.   WE TOOK OUR VEHICLE INTO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE WE PURCHASED IT AND THEY TOLD US THAT THEY NEEDED TO RECALCULATE OUR COMPUTER AT THE  FEE OF $100.  WITHIN TWO WEEKS THE SAME PROBLEM BEGAN TO HAPPEN AGAIN. WE TOOK OUR EXPLORER BACK TO THE DEALER TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM.  WE WERE NOW TOLD THAT IT IS A RACK AND PINION PROBLEM AND IT COULD BE UPWARDS OF $2,000 TO REPAIR.   IT IS NOT COVERED IN OUR EXTENDED WARRANTY AND IT IS NOT COVERED BY THE UPCOMING RECALL THAT WE HAVE SCHEDULED TO REPAIR WHICH IRONICALLY IS A REAR SUSPENSION REPAIR WHICH IF NOT FIXED WILL CAUSE A PROBLEM WITH STEERING.  IN MY OPINION THIS PROBLEM WILL SERIOUSLY HARM OR EVEN KILL THE OWNER AND FAMILY OF A VEHICLE THAT THIS CAN HAPPEN TO AS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL YOUR VEHICLE WHEN THIS OCCURS.  I HOPE THAT THIS ISSUE WILL BE RESOLVED BY FORD AS THIS VEHICLE IS VERY POPULAR FOR FAMILIES DUE TO ITS SIZE AND THIS COULD BE A FATAL MISTAKE TO DRIVE THIS CAR IF THIS ISSUE HAPPENS.",

PUSHING DOWN ON THE ACCELERATOR HAD NO AFFECT AND THE CAR RAPIDLY DECELERATED. THE ENGINE WAS RUNNING VERY ROUGH WITH HEAVY VIBRATION. THIS WAS A TERRIFYING AND NEARLY FATAL EXPERIENCE AS FASTER MOVING TRAFFIC STARTED PASSING ME  ON BOTH SIDES AS I TRIED TO MOVE OFF THE HIGHWAY. I WAS ABLE TO MOVE THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY AND LIMPED OFF THE NEAREST EXIT. ONCE OFF THE EXIT I SHUT THE CAR OFF AND SAT FOR 20 MINUTES WHILE I RE-GAINED MY COMPOSURE AND CALLED MY HUSBAND. WHEN HE ARRIVED HE STARTED THE EXPLORER AND THE WRENCH LIGHT WAS CLEARED. MY HUSBAND DRIVE THE CAR HOME USING ONLY BACK ROADS WHILE I FOLLOWED IN HIS CAR. WE CALLED OUR LOCAL FORD DEALER AND SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT. WE STARTED RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE AND FOUND THIS TO BE A WELL KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE THROTTLE BODY ON FORD'S V6 ENGINES WHICH ARE USED ON MULTIPLE SUV'S, CROSSOVERS AND SEDANS. THE RESEARCH I'VE SEEN SHOWS THIS ISSUE HAS AFFECTED MORE THAN 10,000 OWNERS. HOWEVER, IT'S NOT CLEAR IF THE THROTTLE BODY IS FAULTY DUE TO A MANUFACTURING OR DESIGN DEFECT. IT'S ALSO NOT CLEAR IF REPLACING THE THROTTLE BODY IS A PERMANENT FIX. I'M TERRIFIED TO DRIVE THE CAR ON THE HIGHWAY AND SINCE THIS HAPPENED WE'VE ONLY USED IT FOR SHORTER TRIPS AROUND TOWN. THE FORD DEALER CHECKED THE CAR TODAY (10/08/18) BUT SINCE THE WRENCH LIGHT WAS CLEARED THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG. I PLEADED WITH THE SERVICE ADVISOR TO NO AVAIL. WE'VE BEEN A FORD FAMILY FOR MORE THAN 15 YEARS BUT THIS FAULT AND EVEN WORSE THE FORD SERVICE ADVISOR'S RESPONSE IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. THIS IS A SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS PROBLEM AND ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOMEONE AND THEIR FAMILY ARE KILLED. PLEASE INVESTIGATE AND FORCE FORD TO ISSUE A RECALL.",

THE FIRST MAJOR ISSUE IS  EXHAUST FUMES, GASES ENTERING INTO THE CABIN OF THE VEHICLE WHILE DRIVING AND UPON ACCELERATION. SECOND, 8/25/17, THIS VEHICLE LOST ALL OF ITS FUNCTIONS (BRAKES,STEERING) WHILE I WAS OPERATING THE VEHICLE ON A BUSY STREET WITH MY CHILDREN IN THE CAR. I HAVE MADE THE DECISION THIS VEHICLE IS UNSAFE TO OPERATE AND IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN. I HAVE STOPPED PUTTING MY CHILDREN IN THE CAR BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS MAKING US ILL AND I AM SCARED. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED HEADACHES, NAUSEA, LETHARGY, NOSE BLEEDS, STOMACH ISSUES FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME. WE HAVE BEEN ILL MORE OFTEN THAN NOT. I FEEL THIS VEHICLE IS SILENTLY AND SLOWLY HURTING US. I AM SO FRIGHTENED OF WHAT IT HAS DONE TO US LONG TERM. IT'S ON A DAILY BASIS THAT WE EXPERIENCE THE STRONG FOUL ODOR AND SMELLS OF EXHAUST FUMES AND GASES ENTERING INTO THE CABIN. I CANNOT SAY ENOUGH HOW BADLY IT SMELLS OF EXHAUST.  I DO NOT USE THE A/C OR HEATER BECAUSE I AM SO FEARFUL OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO MYSELF OR MY FAMILY WITH THE WINDOWS CLOSED. THIS IS ON A DAILY BASIS.  8/28/17, I CONTACTED FORD. I SPOKE WITH A REPRESENTATIVE IN CUSTOMER RELATIONS ABOUT EVERYTHING WE WERE EXPERIENCING WITH THE VEHICLE. THEN WAS TRANSFERRED TO A MANAGER WHO TOOK MY VIN# WHILE MAKING NOTATIONS. IN RETURN I WAS GIVEN A CLAIM # AND TOLD SHE COULD NOT PROVIDE ME WITH ANY INFORMATION ABOUT MY VEHICLE ONLY THAT THERE WAS AN INVESTIGATION BEING CONDUCTED AND, SHE WAS SORRY. TWO MONTHS LATER, I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE ANY INFORMATION FROM FORD. SADLY, I'VE HAD TO RESEARCH ON MY OWN AND FOUND ONLY A SERVICE BULLETIN, TSB 14-0130. AS A CONSUMER I AM RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS.

WHILE DRIVING THE 7 MILES FROM MY OFFICE TO THE PALM BAY FORD DEALERSHIP I OPENED THE SUNROOF IN HOPES THAT THE CAR WOULD COOL DOWN QUICKER.  IMMEDIATELY I BEGAN FEELING LIGHT HEADED.  MY HEAD BEGAN SPINNING AND I STARTED FEELING SICK TO MY STOMACH.  IN ONLY A FEW SHORT MINUTES I STARTED LOSING VISION IN MY RIGHT EYE.  I NEVER SMELLED ANYTHING THROUGH THE VENTILATION SYSTEM SO I OPENED THE WINDOW TO TRY AND GET MORE AIR THINKING IT WOULD HELP CALM ME.  IT MADE IT EVEN WORSE.  I WAS TERRIFIED - I COULDN'T SEE TO PULL OVER BUT WASN'T SURE IF I SHOULD KEEP DRIVING.  I COULD ONLY MAKE OUT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME - IT WAS RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC WITH BUMPER TO BUMPER CARS.  I THOUGHT IF I PULLED OVER IT WOULD TAKE LONGER FOR SOMEONE TO GET TO ME IN A PARKING LOT THAN IF I CONTINUED DRIVING - I WAS ABOUT 3 MILES FROM THE DEALERSHIP.  BY THE TIME I PULLED IN TO THE DEALERSHIP IT WAS ALL I COULD NOT TO THROW UP.    AFTER BEING AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR 30 MINUTES I STARTED FEELING BETTER.  WE SPOKE TO THE SERVICE REP, ROSE, AND SHE DOCUMENTED THE INCIDENT IN THE SERVICE RECORD.  WE TALKED ABOUT THE NEWS REPORTS REGARDING THE ISSUES PLAGUING THE EXPLORERS.  SHE CHECKED THE ONLINE SERVICE REPORTS FOR MY CAR AND SHE SAID IT SHOWED GREEN (NO RECALLS OR TSBS).  I WAS SHOCKED AND COULDN'T BELIEVE MY CAR HAD NOT BEEN NOTED AS NEEDING THE EXHAUST REPLACED AFTER ALL THE REPORTED ISSUES WITH THE 2015 EXPLORER.

WE TOOK THE CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP SHORTLY AFTER BUYING THE CAR AND IT SEEMED TO BE OK.  WHEN TAKING THE CAR ON VACATION IN AUG 2017 TO THE MOUNTAINS WE ONCE AGAIN BEGAN SMELLING THE EXHAUST FUMES AGAIN.

WE TOOK THE CAR TO A DIFFERENT DEALERSHIP WHO KEPT IT FOR A WEEK STATING THEY INSTALLED A COMPLETELY NEW EXHAUST SYSTEM FROM THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER TO THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE (AS DESCRIBED IN THE TSB).  ON THE WAY TO THE DEALERSHIP IN AUG 2017 I EXPERIENCED A PARTIAL BLACKOUT ON THE WAY TO THE DEALERSHIP.  IT WAS A VERY HOT DAY, I WAS DRIVING IN HEAVY CITY TRAFFIC GOING FROM LIGHT TO LIGHT, I HAD THE AIR BLASTING IN MY FACE, I OPENED THE SUN ROOF AND IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO FEEL AS I WAS BEING DRUGGED.

AFTER FORD DENYING THAT CARBON MONOXIDE IS NOT ENTERING THE CIVILIAN FORD EXPLORERS, WE PURCHASED A PYLE (PCMM05) LOW LEVEL CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTOR. IT REGISTERS CARBON MONOXIDE LEVELS STARTING AT O PPM. WE PUT THE DETECTOR IN OUR VEHICLE, STARTED IT AND DID NOT MOVE THE VEHICLE AND THE DETECTOR IMMEDIATELY JUMPED TO 5. AFTER THAT WE DROVE THE VEHICLE IN CITY TRAFFIC AND THE DETECTOR THEN JUMPED BACK AND FORTH FROM 10 TO 14 PPM. AFTER THAT WE GOT ON THE INTERSTATE AND DROVE 70 TO 75 AND THE DETECTOR RANGED FROM 23PPM TO 64PPM IN ONLY A 30 MINUTE PERIOD. WE SPENT A TOTAL OF ONLY 2 HOURS IN OUR SUV DOING THIS TESTING. AFTER THAT WE RETURNED HOME AND WERE SICK WITH HEADACHES, NAUSEA, VOMITTING, CHEST PAINS, AND JUST FEELING SICK FOR 6 DAYS. WE ARE  CURRENTLY NOT DRIVING THE VEHICLE BECAUSE OF ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE PROVEN WITH OUR OWN CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTOR. SO IF FORD THINKS THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH OUR VEHICLE, PLEASE BUY IT BACK AND PUT YOUR FAMILY IN. FORD YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO HARD WORKING PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVING TO PAY AND DRIVE THESE ROLLING GAS CHAMBERS. YOU NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND I KNOW WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT FEEL THIS WAY. DO ANY OF YOUR FORD EXECUTIVES DRIVE EXPLORES WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS? YOU SHOULD HAVE TO DRIVE THEM AND EXPERIENCE ALL OF THE SICKNESS! DO YOU NOT HAVE ANY REGARD FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS? QUIT LYING AND DENYING THETRUTH! AND STAY OFF THE TV GIVING FALSE STATEMENTS ABOUT CARBON MONOXIDE NOT BEING IN CIVILIAN FORD EXPLORERS! WE ALL KNOW THAT IS NOT TRUE! HOPEFULLY FORD WILL DO THE RIGHT THING WITH ALL OF THIS AND BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR INFERIOR PRODUCT.  QUIT WASTING TIME AND DO IT. SOMEONE DO SOMETHING, WE ARE PAYING FOR SOMETHING WE CAN'T EVEN USE OR BE SAFE IN.",

IMMEDIATELY AFTER PURCHASING THE VEHICLE WHEN I GOT ON THE HIGHWAY TO DRIVE HOME I SMELLED A BURNING SMELL AND THOUGHT IT MAY BE THE TYPICAL ENGINE BURNOFF SMELL THAT HAPPENS ON SOME NEW CARS.  AFTER THE BURNING SMELL CONTINUED FOR MANY MONTHS AFTER RAPID ACCELERATION OF THE CAR, I TOOK THE CAR TO THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.  MULTIPLE FIREMEN RODE WITH ME  IN THE CAR AND TESTED THE VEHICLE FOR CARBON MONOXIDE WITH THEIR DRAGER X-AM 2500.  THE DEVICE CAME BACK POSITIVE FOR CARBON MONOXIDE IN THE VEHICLE.  THE CARBON MONOXIDE LEVELS APPEAR AS SOON AS YOU ACCELERATE. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TESTED 3 MINUTES OF DRIVING BUT WITHIN 3 MINUTES THE LEVEL GOT TO 38 PPM.  I BOUGHT MY OWN  CO DETECTOR AFTER THAT AND HAVE SEEN LEVELS GET HIGHER INTO THE 50'S AFTER DRIVING 20 MINUTES AND MAKING MULTIPLE ACCELERATIONS. I DIDNT WANT TO CONTINUE THE TESTING FURTHER AS I WAS CONCERNED FOR MY HEALTH.  I HAVE BOTH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT FIRE INCIDENT REPORT STATING THAT CARBON MONOXIDE WAS BUILDING IN THE CAR, ALONG WITH A  SERVICE INVOICE FROM AL PACKER FORD STATING THAT A CARBON MONOXIDE TESTER SHOWS EVIDENCE OF EXHAUST FUMES IN THE VEHICLE.  I KEPT BRINGING THE CAR BACK TO FORD MULTIPLE TIMES COMPLAINING, I BROUGHT THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES IN THE VEHICLE WITH ME AND SHOWED THEM THE CO READINGS.  THEY STATED THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT DID NOT HAVE A CO METER.  EACH TIME THEY TRIED TO FIX THE PROBLEM WITH NO SUCCESS.  I STARTED THE LEMON LAW PROCESS BUT FORD MADE THE PROCESS SO DIFFICULT THAT WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR THE ENGINEER TO COME OUT TO SEE THE CAR I TRADED IT IN.

I WENT THROUGH THE SAME MOTIONS AGAIN BUT COULD NOT REPEAT THE CLUNK NOISE. DROVE THE VEHICLE APPROXIMATELY 20 MILES TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR INSPECTION. THEY REMOVED AND REPLACED THE STEERING GEAR WHICH IS THE ENTIRE RACK. I ASKED AN ADVISER IF THEY KNEW THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE AND OR IF THE NEW PART BEING INSTALLED IS THE SAME AS WHAT WAS REMOVED OR IF THERE WAS AN UPGRADED VERSION. THEY WERE UNABLE TO VERIFY ANY UPGRADES RELATING TO THE FAILURE WHICH HAS ME WORRIED SINCE MY WIFE ALSO DRIVES THE VEHICLE AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FAILURE WON'T OCCUR AGAIN. MY EXTENDED WARRANTY COVERED THE MAJORITY OF THE COSTS.I PAID A $100. DEDUCTIBLE. I AM REPORTING THIS BECAUSE I'M CONVINCED THAT IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT DUE TO OTHER YEAR AND MODEL FORDS DISPLAYING THE SAME PROBLEMS. I ALSO WANT IT DOCUMENTED IN CASE IT HAPPENS AGAIN.

AFTER THAT DID NOT WORK, SHE APPLIED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, WHICH DID NOT DO ANYTHING EITHER. FINALLY, SHE TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND PUT THE CAR IN PARK, WHICH DIDN'T DO ANYTHING EITHER.     SHE ENDED UP DOING A U-TURN IN REVERSE. MY OTHER TRUCK WAS PARKED TO THE RIGHT OF WHERE THE FORD EXPLORER WAS PARKED, SO ONCE THE FORD EXPLORER REACHED MY PARKED TRUCK AND COLLIDED WITH IT, THE FORD EXPLORER FINALLY STOPPED.

I MOVED IT AROUND, PUSHED, AND PULLED ON THE NOZZLE TO NO AVAIL.THE VEHICLE WAS OBVIOUSLY STATIONARY AT THIS TIME. AFTER ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AND WITH THE HELP OF OTHER PEOPLE I WAS UNABLE TO GET THE NOZZLE OUT OF MY VEHICLE. I TOLD THE GAS STATION ATTENDANT WHO WAS ABLE TO PUSH AND PULL THE NOZZLE ENOUGH TO GET IT DISLODGED FROM MY VEHICLE.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM AUTO NATION FRISCO, TEXAS. MY VEHICLE HAD LESS THAN FIVE THOUSAND MILES ON IT AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. THE DEALER REFUSED TO REPLACE THE CAPLESS FUEL SYSTEM COMPONENT SAYING IT WAS NOT BROKE IT WAS A GAS STATION ISSUE- FAULTY FUEL NOZZLE?? I SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MANAGER WHO REFUSED TO REPLACE THE COMPONENT. I WROTE A LETTER TO THE GM OF THE DEALERSHIP AS WELL AS THE VP OF CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR AUTO NATION EXPLAINING THE PROBLEM AND ASKING TO BE CONTACTED. AS OF THIS WRITING I HAVE HAD NO RESPONSE. I FILLED A COMPLAINT WITH FORD MOTOR CO. CASE# 7943196. ON 10-8-2015 I WAS ADVISED THAT THE CASE WAS CLOSED. I WAS NEVER ABLE TO TALK TO THEM SO I LEFT A VOICE MAIL AND SENT A E-MAIL ASKING TO BE CONTACTED. AS OF THIS WRITING I HAVE HAD NO RESPONSE.  I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER AFTER THE INCIDENT THAT THERE WAS A BULLETIN EXPLAINING WHAT NOZZLES TO AVOID. SEEMS LIKE GOOD INFORMATION TO HAVE PRIOR TO AN INCIDENT NOT AFTER!! I BELIEVE THIS TO BE A REAL PROBLEM AND DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE USING MY VEHICLE UNTIL THE COMPONENT IS REPLACED. HAVING TO PULL, PUSH, AND PRY TO GET A FUEL NOZZLE OUT OF YOUR VEHICLE SURE SEEMS LIKE A OBVIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. THE CAR DEALER AND FORD MOTOR CO. SAYS ITS NOT THEIR PROBLEM. THE GAS STATION ATTENDANT SAID IT WAS A FORD PROBLEM. CONSUMER STUCK IN THE MIDDLE!!",

THE SMELL WOULD OCCUR ESPECIALLY DURING A HARD ACCELERATION.  THE SMELL WAS NOTICEABLE WHILE THE A/C SYSTEM WAS ON \"VENT\" AND \"RECIRCULATE\" MODE.      ON 7/6/2015 I TOOK THE EXPLORER TO MY FORD DEALERSHIP AND THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPLAINT AND STATED THERE WAS A SERVICE BULLETIN 14-130 TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  THEIR DESCRIPTION ON THE FIX, WAS THAT A SPECIAL AIR-FILTER LOCATED INSIDE THE REAR BUMPER AREA NEEDED TO BE REPLACE.  THEY STATED THAT THE SMELL IS COMING FROM MY EVAP-CANISTER.  I LEFT THE EXPLORER THERE FOR THE REPAIR AND IT TOOK THEM ALMOST TWO DAYS.  THEY SAID, IT WAS AT LEAST A FULL DAYS LABOR TO FIX THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY HAD TO REMOVE THE WHOLE REAR BUMPER AND OTHER PARTS, ETC.    AFTER THE REPAIR WAS MADE, A WEEK LATER, I WAS ABLE TO TAKE THE EXPLORER ON THE FREEWAY AND STILL NOTICED THE ROTTEN EGG ODOR DURING ACCELERATION.

I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS 2015 EXPLORER HAS THE WORST DESIGN ON THE INSIDE THAT I'VE EVER SEEN.    THE OUTWARD VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER'S SEAT FOR THE FRONT AND REAR OF THIS VEHICLE IS SEVERELY COMPROMISED BY THE HUGE C PILLARS WHICH CREATE BLIND SPOTS WITHIN THE VEHICLE.    ALTHOUGH THIS MODEL HAS BLIS, I'VE ALMOST BEEN IN 2 COLLISIONS BECAUSE I CANNOT SEE MY RIGHT SIDE REAR OR LEFT SIDE REAR DUE TO THE FAULTY DESIGN OF THE INTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE. THE BLIS SYSTEM DID NOT WARN ME THAT THERE WAS A TRACTOR TRAILER APPROACHING ME ON THE LEFT SIDE. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT THE DEALER CANNOT REMEDY. THIS IS A FACTORY DESIGN FLAW THAT IS GOING TO GET SOMEONE SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED BECAUSE THE DRIVER CAN'T SEE WHAT'S COMING. THE BLIS IS USELESS.    NAVIGATING THROUGH TIGHT SPACES IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE YOU CANNOT SEE THE FRONT END TO JUDGE YOUR DISTANCE BETWEEN VEHICLES/OBJECTS AND THE WIDE FRONT PILLARS ALSO ADD TO THE FRUSTRATION OF TRYING TO SEE WHAT'S ON THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE.    THE BLOWER MOTOR FOR THE HEATING/AC SYSTEM JUST TURNS OFF AS WELL AS THE DASHBOARD CLUSTER LIGHTS AND THEN COMES BACK ON AFTER 10 - 15 SECONDS. THIS HAS OCCURRED A FEW TIMES.    THERE IS A BURNING SMELL INSIDE THE VEHICLE UPON START UP. NOT SURE IF IT'S EXHAUST GAS ENTERING THE VEHICLE OR IF IT'S SOMETHING IN THE HEATER/AC SYSTEM. (I WAS TOLD AT THE DEALERSHIP THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM AND WILL DISSIPATE AFTER A FEW THOUSAND MILES). NOT THE ANSWER THAT I WANTED TO HEAR.    I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE.
