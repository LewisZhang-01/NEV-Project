I had researched any recalls on the vehicle before I even looked at it. I found that there was one for an airbag problem. Long story short, I purchased the vehicle and the previous owner took it for the recall issue to be repaired before I picked it up.  About 2 weeks after I got it, I noticed that the dashboard was vibrating and that was not anything that was happening when I purchased it. I thought it might just be loose. I\u2019m only 5 feet tall so I could not see over the domed instrument panel when driving. It was only when my daughter drove it that she was the one who noticed the very large crack. It\u2019s cracked on both sides with the largest being on the driver\u2019s side. The crack covers the entire dashboard from the windshield to the dome over the instrument panel. I feel that this is a serious safety issue. I have recently discovered that there was a lawsuit against GM asking for these vehicles to be recalled for this problem. Apparently it happens quite a bit!! I called the dealership that repaired the airbag issue but of course they couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t help me. I  know these dashboards are expensive to replace..upwards of $2000. I wanted to file a complaint because as I said earlier, this is a safety concern for me. Can you help?",

PLENTY OF DATA SHOWS THAT THE DEFECT OF GM DASHBOARDS CRACKING IS WIDESPREAD, HOWEVER, GM FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR FAULT AND RECALL AFFECTED VEHICLES. I AM CONTACTING YOU AS A CONCERNED OWNER AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY AND THAT OF MY FAMILY. I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING TO GET THE PROBLEM FIXED BY GM OR THE GM DEALERSHIP THAT SOLD ME THE VEHICLE. HOWEVER, THEY ALL HAVE TURN A BLIND EYE TO THE ISSUE.   I HOPE THIS MESSAGE DOES NOT FALL IN DEAF EARS AND YOU CAN ASSIST ME IN SOLVING THIS HAZARDOUS SITUATION I AM IN DUE TO GM LACK OF CONCERN FOR SAFETY.",

IT IS OBVIOUS A DEFECT AFFECTING THOUSANDS OF VEHICLES AND IGNORING, PUTTING HUNDRES OF LIVES AT RISK TO SAVE GM'S BOTTOM LINE, IS UNACCEPTABLE. I HAVE EXHAUSTED COUNTLESS HOURS DEALING WITH GM'S CUSTOMER SERVICES REPS AND THEY ALL WORK OUT OF A UNIFIED SCRIPT AND REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM AND REPLACE THE PART. NOW I FIND MYSELF DRIVING A TIME BOMB WITH MY FAMILY IN IT. I AM BEGGING YOUR AGENCY TO LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE AGAIN AND TO NOT LOOK THE OTHER WAY.

THE, ISSUE, FOR THE ORO VALLEY POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED IN THE SUMMER OF 2015 AND INCLUDED VEHICLES IN OUR FLEET FROM 2012'S THROUGH 2015'S.  THIS SUMMER, MORE VEHICLES EXHIBITED THE ISSUES TO INCLUDE 2016'S INCLUDING ANOTHER AGENCY'S 2017 THAT BECAME AN ITEM OF DISCUSSION AT A GM CONFERENCE ON FLEET VEHICLES HELD UP IN PHOENIX.  GM SPENT APPROXIMATELY A YEAR AND A HALF TRYING TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM TO EVENTUALLY DETERMINE THAT THE FUEL PUMPS NEEDED TO BE REDESIGNED ALONG WITH A NEW HIGH PRESSURE FUEL LINE. WE HAVE HAD SOME VEHICLES RECEIVE  THE NEW PUMPS, BUT NOT ALL AS THE ISSUES WENT AWAY AS THE TEMPERATURES WENT BELOW 100.  AT THIS DATE WE ARE NOT SURE IF THE \"FIX\" IS LIMITED TO 2015'S AND 16'S AND ARE LEFT WITH POSSIBLE ISSUES WITH 2012-2014'S.  AT A GM CONFERENCE ON 6/29/17, IN DISCUSSION WITH THE REGIONAL FLEET SALES REP FOR GM, WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE WERE NO REDESIGNED FUEL PUMPS AND HIGH PRESSURES HOSES AVAILABLE IN THE U.S. AND NO TIME TABLE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF SAME.  IT WAS LEARNED AT THE GM CONFERENCE THAT NUMEROUS AGENCIES ARE EXPERIENCING THE ISSUES.  OUR DEPARTMENT HAS DOCUMENTATION THAT WOULD FAIRLY CLEARLY SHOW THAT THE ISSUES DESCRIBED ARE OCCURRING TO CIVILIAN CHEVROLET TAHOES ALSO. INDICATIONS ARE GM CONTINUES TO PUT OLD FUEL PUMPS ON VEHICLES PRODUCED AFTER THE REDESIGN.  THE POOR ACCELERATION AND STALLING IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONCERN FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT.
