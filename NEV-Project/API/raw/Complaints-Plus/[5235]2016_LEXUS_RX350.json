        "summary": "Around the middle of the month of January of 2022, I discovered that my 2016 Lexus RX350 has massive oil leak from timing chain cover. Thompson Lexus dealership confirmed this oil leak. This leak not just happened, but it has happened long ago at least 6 months prior to the time that I discovered based on old oil dirty debris deposits and paints popped out and rusted caused by prolong oil on the frame. The reason that did not detect the oil leak right away was that I have almost not used the car at all for the past two years due to Covid situation. Second, I have parked my car on my lawn, so that could not see oil drops. Third, I put my trust on Lexus and Toyota products, so I have not inspected for oil leak periodically. This oil leak has soaked many parts of the engine, frame, electrical connections, and possibly other moving parts such pulleys and belts. This can potentially create smoke or fire hazard and belt and pulley slippery which can lead to accidents. At the time of the oil leak, my car was under 54,000 miles and under 6 years, so it was still under powertrain warranty with is 6 years and 70,000 miles. I have contacted Lexus several times regarding this matter. I told them about location of the oil leak and when oil started leaking, my car was still under powertrain warranty but Lexus refused to pay for the timing cover repair. After doing research on RX350 from timing chain cover, I have found out that a lot of Lexus RX350 has developed oil leak from timing chain cover since year 2009 or 2010 model to 2016 year model. Some RX350 developed timing chain cover oil leak from a few thousand miles of first use to 38,000 miles. Lexus was aware of the problem, but completely ignored and failed address the problem and issue a recall.",

When I could find a safe place to pull over, I looked and discovered that my moonroof had shattered. Had the curtain under the moonroof had not been drawn, I would have been hit with the shattered glass, probably resulting in my loss of control over the vehicle at interstate speed, resulting in a serious accident or death. I returned immediately to my dealership, Hennessy Lexus in Duluth, Georgia. They contacted the Lexus regional manager, who denied Lexus' responsibility for the failure. I did, (and needed to) have the moonroof repaired by the dealership. I also contacted Lexus Corporate office by phone, and sent them by email a copy of photos of the broken moonroof and the invoice for the repair. They passed my inquiry down to the regional manager (again) who again denied Lexus responsibility for the failure. The failure occurred in fair weather on a highway with very little traffic, trees or overpasses, and there was no reason to believe that any outside forces caused the failure. I feel that this potentially dangerous failure is a result of poor manufacture or design.",

THE COBWEB EFFECT WAS 100%, AND EXTENDED TO EVERY SQUARE INCH OF THE GLASS, ALL THE WAY AROUND THE PERIMETER. I CALLED THE LEXUS DEALERSHIP NEAREST ME; AND I CALLED OUR INSURANCE PROVIDER TO START A CLAIM.  GIVEN I WAS SOME DISTANCE FROM HOME, IT WAS LATE FRIDAY, AND NO ONE COULD GET THE GLASS, I HAD A LOCAL AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR SHOP (THE LOCAL AREA CONTRACT FOR OUR INSURANCE COMPANY) COLLISION WRAP  THE ROOF SO I COULD DRIVE HOME, AVOID FLINGING GLASS ON TRAFFIC, AND BE PROTECTED IN CASE OF RAIN. MY HUSBAND NOTIFIED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE WE LEASED THE VEHICLE AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT (WE GO TOMORROW).  NO ONE FROM THE TWO DEALERSHIPS OR THE INSURANCE COMPANY MENTIONED THAT SUNROOFS ON LEXUS/TOYOTA HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO SPONTANEOUSLY \"POP\" SINCE 2010.  THE CAUSE OF THIS RISK MUST BE DEFECTIVE DESIGN AND/OR GLASS; THE SUNROOF MATERIALS BEING USED ARE EVIDENTLY UNABLE TO TAKE THE PRESSURE AND ABSORB THE SHOCK. THE ROOF'S MOST VULNERABLE PART IS EXPLODING AS A RESULT. 2016 MODEL; DRIVEN 6 MOS; >6000 MI.",

I ENTERED OUR GARAGE FOR THE PURPOSE OF BACKING THE LEXUS OUT OF THE GARAGE SO WE COULD LOAD NEWLY PURCHASED PATIO FURNITURE INTO THE GARAGE.  I ENTERED THE LEXUS, APPLIED THE BRAKE PEDDLE TO START THE AUTOMOBILE.  ONCE THE AUTO WAS STARTED, KEEPING MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE TO ALLOW MY SHIFTING, I MOVE THE SHIFT LEVER FROM PARK TO REVERSE AND TO MY SURPRISE, THE CAR BEGAN MOVING WITH NEVER REMOVING MY FOOT FROM THE BRAKE.  IT IS A VERY TIGHT SQUEEZE BACKING OUT OF OUR GARAGE SO WHEN THE CAR STARTED MOVING, I PRESSED MORE FIRMLY ON THE BRAKE TO SLOW THE PROGRESS AND THERE WAS NO RESPONSE.  I PRESSED ON THE BRAKE HARDER AND WHEN IT KEPT CONTINUING TO NOT RESPOND, I TRIED TO LOCATE THE EMERGENCY BRAKING SYSTEM BY PUSHING WITH MY LEFT FOOT ON THE FLOOR TRYING TO ENGAGE IT.  THE WHOLE INCIDENT LASTED ONLY A COUPLE OF SECONDS CAUSING THE COLLISION TO OCCUR.      THIS WAS REPORTED TO HARTFORD INSURANCE COMPANY AUTO CLAIM # PA0016731644 WHOSE ULTIMATE CONCLUSION WAS AS FOLLOWS: \"UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION WE DETERMINED....THE TOYOTA MOTOR COMPANY TO BE THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY.\"    MY LAST COMMUNICATION WITH TOYOTA MOTOR NORTH AMERICA WAS WITH CARLOS GARCIA IN THE LEGAL CLAIMS DEPARTMENT DATED FEBRUARY 10TH, 2017, COPY ATTACHED ALSO ATTACHED IS MY CORRESPONDENCE OF MAY 11, 2016    THE BOTTOM LINE IS TOYOTA HAS NOT CONDUCTED AN IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION OF A SIGNIFICANT FAILURE IN THE DESIGN/MANUFACTURE OF THEIR AUTOMOBILE.  THEY ARE TOTALLY RELYING ON HEARSAY EVIDENCE WHICH IS THIRD HAND AND FALSE, HOPING THIS WILL ALL GO AWAY.  I MADE MY AUTOMOBILE AVAILABLE TO THEM AS WELL AS MYSELF AND OTHERS WHO WITNESSED THE EVENT.  THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A INNOCENT CHILD THAT WAS DAMAGED, RATHER THAN ANOTHER VEHICLE.

THE SALESMAN SAID THAT THIS WAS A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR HIM IN A LEXUS VEHICLE WITH THIS FEATURE.  LEXUS HAD A TEAM INSPECT THE VEHICLE.  LEXUS SAID THAT THE LACK OF THE PASSING INDICATOR TO SEE ALL VEHICLES IN THE BLIND SPOT WAS NORMAL FOR THE 2016 LEXUS RX 350. I HAVE DRIVEN THE CAR FOR 8 MONTHS.  I FIRST NOTICED THE APPARENT MALFUNCTION DRIVING BACK TO PA FROM FL.  I BELIEVE THAT THE CAR PASSING INDICATOR SYSTEM USES RELATIVE DIFFERENCES OF SPEED BETWEEN MY CAR AND THE CAR BEING PASSED TO ACTIVATE THE FEATURE.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE INDICATOR LIGHT WILL NOT GO ON WHILE I PASS A CAR A  MUCH GREATER SPEED THAN THE CAR BEING PASSED.  I WOULD GUESS THE DIFFERENCE MAY BE 20 MPH OR SO.  HOWEVER, IF I PASS A CAR SLOWLY OR AT A LOW DIFFERENCE OF SPEED, THE CAR PASSING INDICATOR LIGHT FUNCTIONS AS ONE WOULD EXPECT.
