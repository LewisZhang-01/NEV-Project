I ASKED WHAT WAS THIS GOING TO COST AND WHO WOULD BE PAYING FOR THE WORK.  SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THE TOTAL WOULD BE IN THE $4500 RANGE, BUT HE WOULD CHECK WITH GM TO SEE IF THEY WOULD PAY PART OF THIS.  NEXT DAY SERVICE MANAGER SAID GM WOULD PAY FOR ALL EXCEPT A $500 \"WARRANTY DEDUCTIBLE\".

I TRAVELED ANOTHER 11 MILES TO PLAINVILLE, AND WHEN I ARRIVED THE  \"STABILIZER CONTROL LIGHT WENT OUT. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO  A MECHANIC THEM TO EVALUATE IT.  AFTER SEVERAL HOURS AND TWO DIAGNOSTIC TESTS ALL ELECTRICAL FUNCTION REFLECT NORMAL.  THE PROBLEM COULD NOT BE ISOLATED OR DUPLICATED.  I CONTACT GENERAL MOTORS YESTERDAY, TO REPORT THE SERIOUS SAFETY DEFECT AND HOW CRITICAL THIS IS AND I COULD HAVE BEEN INJURED OR KILLED AT THAT SPEED DRIVING IN THE DARK.  I ALSO ASKED THEM IF THEY HAVE HAD SIMILAR REPORTINGS OF THIS OCCURRENCE AND RECEIVED A MIXED RESPONSE.  THERE RESPONSE WAS BUREAUCRATIC, TAKE IT TO A CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP.  I SAID NO.  I AM NOT PAYING ANOTHER $150.00 TELL ME WE CANNOT FIND A PROBLEM.  I KEPT STRESSING THERE IS A PROBLEM \"VEHICLES SUDDENLY DO NOT JUST DROPPED OFF ALL ELECTRICAL POWER AND FUNCTION AND MAGICALLY JUST COME BACK ON\".    THIS IS NOT NORMAL FOR ANY VEHICLE TO HAPPEN.  I ALSO INFORMED THEM AS A COURTESY I WOULD SPEAK TO THEM (GENERAL MOTORS) FIRST BEFORE I CONTACT THIS AGENCY.  I ALSO TRIED TO EMPHASIZE TO THEM, PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE A DIRECT LINE OF COMMUNICATION TO THE CORPORATION TO REPORT SAFETY AND LIFE THREATENING ISSUES DIRECTLY.  THE NATURE OF THE RESPONSE IS BASICALLY WE DON'T DO ANYTHING UNLESS WE RECEIVE INFORMATION FROM GM SERVICE DEPARTMENTS.  *TR",
