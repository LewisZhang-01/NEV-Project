AT JUST OVER 130,000 MILES THE ENGINE BEGAN KNOCKING ON THE INTERSTATE AND PROGRESSIVELY GREW WORSE AS I WAS LOOKING FOR A EXIT, IT STARTED TO LOSE POWER AND I GOT IT TO THE SHOULDER BEFORE IT DIED. LATER THAT DAY I HAD A TOW TRUCK PULL IT UP TO A TRUSTED SHOP ABOUT 60 MILES AWAY. THE MECHANIC THERE SAID THAT IT DROPED A ROD AND THE CRANKSHAFT WAS SHOT. AFTER TALKING TO HIM, HE SAID THAT THIS IS A FAIRLY FREQUENT OCCURRENCE. I TOOK IT TO GET A SECOND OPINION FROM ANOTHER SHOP A FEW MILES AWAY AND HAD THE SAME CONVERSATION. BOTH MECHANICS AND A FEW FOURMS ON THE INTERNET SAID THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH THE 1998-2003 AND 2004 HERITAGE, THAT HAVE THE FORD 5.4 TRITON 2V ENGINE. AT THE MECHANIC THE THE TRUCK WAS DIAGNOSED AS NONREPAREABLE ENGINE AND WOULD HAVE TO BE SWAPED OUT FOR A DIFFRENT ONE. THE COST OF THIS WAS FOR A REBUILT ENGINE BY JASPER'S BECASUE A DONOR TRUCK ENGINE WOULD BE PRONE TO THE SAME FAILURE. THE COST TO REPLACE WOULD TOTAL OUT TO BE AROUND $6500 BETWEEN PARTS AND LABOR INCLUDING THE NEW ENGINE. BE WARY OF THE FORD 5.4 2V ENGINES, THERE ARE A FEW UNICORNS OUT THERE THAT WILL NEVER HAVE A PROBLEM, BUT MOST, EVEN IF THEY HAVE REGULAR MAINTENANCE LIKE MINE WILL BE PRONE TO THIS FATE.",

REGARDING THE 2011 RECALL FOR FAULTY GAS TANK STRAPS WAS RECEIVED THE WEEK OF OCTOBER 20TH 2014, ALTHOUGH I HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE FOR OVER A YEAR.  AN APPOINTMENT WAS MADE WITH BRONDES FORD IN MAUMEE, OHIO THE FOLLOWING WEEK.  THE VEHICLE, WHICH WAS HAVING NO ISSUES AT ALL, WAS LEFT WITH ~$900 IN DAMAGE.  THE FAULTY STRAPS HAD CORRODED THROUGH TO THE GAS TANK, AND SO WHEN THEY WERE REMOVED, LEFT HOLES IN THE GAS TANK. IN RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE, THIS CONSEQUENCE HAS BEEN RAMPANT AMONG THESE REPAIRS, YET NEITHER FORD NOR THEIR DEALERS' SERVICE DEPARTMENTS WILL COVER THE DAMAGE! SO A TRUCK THAT WAS IN PERFECT WORKING CONDITION WAS RENDERED USELESS. HOW CAN FORD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STRAPS BUT NOT THE RESULTING DAMAGE THEY CAUSE?  I GET THAT MY TRUCK IS OLD, BUT IF REPLACING THE STRAPS RUNS THE RISK OF CAUSING DAMAGE THE OWNER WILL BE LIABLE FOR, IT SHOULD BE CLEARLY OUTLINED! THE NOTION THAT ONLY THE FAULTY STRAPS ARE FORD'S LIABILITY IS NEGLIGENT. MY HOPE IS THIS ISSUE WILL BE READDRESSED WITH FORD AND THE OWNERS REIMBURSED FOR THE DAMAGES CAUSED BY FORD AND ITS AGENTS.

I LOOKED ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE AND SEE A LOT OF THESE ISSUES, BUT SINCE THE GREAT MOUNDS OF NHTSA SEEM TO BELIEVE NEARLY TOTAL BRAKE FAILURE IS NOT AN ISSUE, I JUST REPLACE THE PART OF THE LINE THAT IS LEAKING.  IT WILL VERY LIKELY FAIL AGAIN SOON, BUT I KNOW THAT IT THAT WAS A PROBLEM, THEN NHTSA WOULD DO ITS JOB AND PUSH A RECALL.  JUST ANOTHER CASE OF NHTSA DECIDING WHICH CONSUMERS SHOULD BE PROTECTED UNDER THE LAW AND WHICH ONES SHOULD HAVE THEIR LIVES PUT AT RISK.  I GOT A NOTE FROM [XXX] AT NHTSA CLAIMING THEY MIGHT CONDUCT A STUDY, BUT GIVEN THAT A 10 MONTH STUDY BY NHTSA WAS INSUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE THAT GASOLINE SPILLING OUT ONTO THE HIGHWAY MAY POSE A CONSUMER RISK, I'M BETTING THIS WILL GO NO WHERE.

I ASK FORD TO FIX THE LININGS AT NO CHARGE AND TAKE THE LINE FOR OBSERVATION. I WAS TOLD THAT SINCE THE TRUCK IS 10 YEARS OLD AND HAS 200,000MILES ON IT THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING. I STATED THAT FORD HAS NO PROBLEM REPAIRING THE GAS STRAPS OF A 10 YEAR OLD TRUCK. ANYWAY HAD MY TRUCK TOWED TO MY MECHANIC AND REPAIRED. THEY REPLACED THE FRONT LINES AND INTERMEDIATE BRAKE LINES DUE TO POOR CORROSION. I WAS TOLD MY PASSENGER SIDE LINE AND BOTH REAR LINES ARE IN GREAT SHAPE, NO RUST AND COATED. I TOLD FORD ABOUT THIS AND SAID I WANT A FORD REP TO INSPECT MY COATED BRAKE LINES. AND MY DEFECTED LINE WHICH I KEPT FOR PROOF. I ASK FORD WHY SOME LINE WERE COATED AND SOME WERE NOT. I WAS TOLD THAT FORD DOES NOT COAT THE LINES. WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM HERE AND COULD RESULT IN MANY DEATHS. IF THE OTHER LINES WERE COATED I WOULD HAVE NOT HAD THIS PROBLEM.

UPON CLOSER INVESTIGATION I DISCOVERED THAT THE DANGLING OBJECT WAS THE REMAINS OF THE FRONT FUEL TANK MOUNTING STRAP WHICH HAD FAILED DUE TO CORROSION.  THE FRONT OF THE FUEL TANK WAS DROOPING DOWN FOUR TO SIX INCHES FROM ITS NORMAL POSITION AND THE TANK WAS BEING HELD ONLY BY THE REAR STRAP.  EXAMINATION OF THE REAR STRAP REVEALED THAT IT WAS ALSO SEVERELY RUSTED.  THE FOLLOWING MORNING I PURCHASED NEW FRONT AND REAR FUEL TANK MOUNTING STRAPS FROM MY LOCAL FORD DEALER'S PARTS DEPARTMENT AND INSTALLED THEM MYSELF.  AS A RETIRED ENGINEER, I WAS DISAPPOINTED BY HOW FLIMSY THESE STRAPS ARE AND HOW THEIR CORROSION RESISTANCE IS OBVIOUSLY INADEQUATE TO PREVENT FAILURE.  THAT EVENING, SATURDAY, JULY 31, 2011, THERE WAS A REPORT ON A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION OF A HAZMAT TEAM RESPONSE TO AN INCIDENT NEAR GOOD HOPE ROAD AND US HIGHWAY 45 IN MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN IN WHICH THE FUEL TANK OF A FORD F150 PICKUP HAD FALLEN TO THE GROUND DUE TO FAILURE OF THE FUEL TANK STRAPS.  THAT LED ME TO THE DISCOVERY THAT NHTSA HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING CORROSION FAILURES OF FUEL TANK MOUNTING STRAPS ON F150S.  I BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT A VEHICLE SAFETY DEFECT IS PRESENT IN THE DESIGN OF THESE STRAPS, IN THAT THE DESIGN IS INSUFFICIENT TO PREVENT OR WITHSTAND CORROSION WHICH COULD REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO OCCUR DURING THE NORMALLY EXPECTED LIFETIME OF THE VEHICLE.  I STRONGLY URGE THAT A MANDATORY RECALL BE ISSUED AGAINST FORD F150 VEHICLES AND ANY OTHERS USING THESE OR SIMILARLY INADEQUATE FUEL TANK MOUNTING STRAPS.  *TR",

THE OWNER OF THE SHOP KNEW OF THIS PROBLEM WHEN I BROUGHT THE TRUCK IN AND STATED THAT THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS TRUCK AND THAT HE HAS DONE APPROXIMATELY 20 OF THEM IN THE PAST YEAR.  $1400.00 DOLLARS LATER MY TRUCK RIDES MUCH BETTER AND NOISE FREE.  I THOUGHT THAT I HAD SOMETHING GOING ON  THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE TRUCK, FOR IT WOULD BOUNCE TERRIBLY OVER BUMPS.  I THOUGHT MAYBE A BAD SHOCK.  TURNS OUT AFTER THIS REPAIR, THE PROBLEM IS GONE.  *TR",

I CALLED 911, POLICE AND FIRE (EQUIPPED TO STABILIZE THE FUEL SPILL) AND A TOW COMPANY WERE SENT TO ASSIST. A REPORT WAS MADE BY THE LOCAL POLICE. THE TRUCK WAS THEN TAKEN BY MY REQUEST TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP WHERE IT HAD BEEN PURCHASED NEW. NEXT DAY: THE DEALERSHIP QUOTED AN ASTRONOMICAL PRICE FOR REPLACEMENT OF DAMAGED PARTS & LABOR (1600-2000). AFTER RESEARCH HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO ANOTHER FACILITY FOR THE REPAIRS WHICH WERE COMPLETED THE SAME WEEK BY THAT THU. EVENING. I DO HAVE THE DEFECTIVE PARTS IN MY POSSESSION (FUEL TANK STRAPS).

THAT MORNING WHEN I STARTED IT UP, IT HAD A NOISE WHEN I TURNED THE WHEEL, WHEN I BROUGHT IT IN, THEY SAID THE GASKET ON MY POWER STEERING HAD GONE BAD, AND I NEEDED A COMPLETE REPLACEMENT OF MY POWER STEERING PUMP.  NOW IS WHEN THE REAL PROBLEM STARTS...  I HAD NOT EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM PRIOR TO THE DEALER VISIT.  ALL OF THE SUDDEN WHEN I DRIVE ON THE HIGHWAY, ANY ROUGH ROAD SENDS IT INTO UNCONTROLLABLE SHAKING, I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO LOSE COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE TRUCK, IT COULD EASILY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  I LOOKED FOR THIS PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET, AND FOUND THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR MANY FORD SD DRIVERS, AND AS OTHERS HAVE PUT IT, FORD WON'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL THE DEATHS OUT WAY THE RECALL COST.  IT IS UP TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU, TO KEEP US SAFE, AND MAKE THESE CAR COMPANIES FIX THEIR PROBLEM VEHICLES BEFORE THERE ARE TOO MANY DEATHS.  I AM SURE THERE HAS  TO OF BEEN AN ACCIDENT CAUSED BY THIS PROBLEM, VERY POSSIBLY 1 OR MORE DEATHS, I KNOW OF ONE PERSON WITH THIS PROBLEM  ON THE WEBSITE CAUSED A 3 CAR ACCIDENT.  I CALLED THE DEALER, THEY WANT TO COME TO MY HOME AND DRIVE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP, I SAID I WOULD HAVE IT TOWED IN, BUT THEY WANT TO DRIVE IT, WHICH MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE, SINCE I AM LIABLE FOR WHAT HAPPENS WITH MY TRUCK.

THIS IS FAR FROM BEING OVER, AND THE REPAIR COSTS ARE UNBELIEVABLE AND WE ARE NOT READY FOR AND WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE IT IS GOING TO BE REPAIRED. EVERYONE SEEMS TO THINK THAT IT MUST BE AN ORIGINAL MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT THERE IS NO OTHER ANSWER TO HAVE A HOLE IN AT LEAST ONE PISTON AND HAVE THAT LOSE METAL PIECE SOMEWHERE IN THE ENGINE MAYBE CAUSING MORE DAMAGE IF THE WHOLE ENGINE IS NOT CHANGED.

I HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED FORD NUMEROUS TIMES WITH NO RESOLUTION, WAS REFERRED BACK TO THE NHTSA BY THE CA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, AND REFERRED TO THE NHTSA BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.  SO, HERE I AM, BACK TO YOU, THE NHTSA.  FORD MOTOR COMPANY IS NOT COMPLYING WITH FEDERAL REGULATION AND NOBODY IS WILLING TO ENFORCE THE REGULATION, NOT EVEN THE NHTSA.  ANY SUGGESTIONS????? THANK YOU.  *TR",

LUCKILY, NO ONE ELSE HIT THE TIRE AND NO DAMAGE WAS DONE. HOWEVER, SEVERE VEHICLE DAMAGE, SERIOUS INJURY, OR EVEN DEATH COULD HAVE OCCURRED DUE TO THIS INCIDENT. UPON FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE MOUNT I FOUND THAT THE CABLE THAT SECURES THE TIRE WAS SNAPPED OFF. I  HAD THE VEHICLE FOR THE 42,000 MILES AND HAD  NOT ONCE USED THE SPARE. NOWHERE IN ANY VEHICLE MANUAL DOES IT SAY TO MAINTAIN OR REPLACE THE CABLE AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF MILES. THE CABLE IS EXPECTED TO LAST THE ENTIRE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE. THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE. I AM AFRAID TO FOLLOW BEHIND ANY FORD TRUCKS  BECAUSE AT ANY MOMENT ANOTHER OF THESE CABLES COULD SNAP. THIS IS NOT A WARRANTY ISSUE. FORD REFUSED TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM AS IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY. THE CABLE SIMPLY SHOULD NOT BREAK.  THE COST QUOTED BY FORD WAS ABOUT $200 TO FIX THIS. FORD NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OF THIS AT ITS  OWN EXPENSE.

I ONLY REMEMBER ASKING JENNIFER, \"WHAT  HAPPENED AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO US NOW.\"  A NEIGHBOR WAS DRIVING HOME THAT DAY AND SAID HE SAW FLAMES COMING OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD OF MY TRUCK WHICH WAS PARKED PARTIALLY UNDER THE CARPORT.  HE SAID THE TRUCK WAS THEN WITHIN SECONDS BURNING SO FIERCELY THAT IT BLEW UP LIKE A BOMB SENDING A FIRE BOMB INTO OUR HOME.   I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT WHEN HE SAID THAT MY TRUCK HAD CAUGHT FIRE AND DESTROYED OUR HOME.  WE LOST EVERYTHING.  I RUN A ROOFING COMPANY AND JENNIFER HANDLED ALL MY PAPERWORK -  THE OFFICE WAS SET UP AT HOME SO SHE COULD STAY HOME WITH OUR CHILDREN.  WE LOST OUR BUSINESS, HOME AND MEMORIES SUCH AS PICTURES OF OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILY.  I AM STILL TRYING TO RECOVER EMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY FROM OUR LOSS DUE TO FIRE.   FORD MOTOR CO. SENT A INVESTIGATOR TO INVESTIGATE THE FIRE AND OUR HOMEOWNERS INS. INVESTIGATOR ALSO WAS THERE THE DAY \"FORD FINALLY SENT SOMEONE TO INVESTIGATE THE FIRE\".

I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP, THEY HAD NO CLUE WHAT WAS WRONG BUT SAID TO BRING IT BACK.  AFTER WORK THAT EVENING WE RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP. WE WAITED AN HOUR WHILE THEY CHECKED EVERYTHING, COULDN'T FIND A PROBLEM. SUDDENLY THEY DECIDED TO MOVE THE TILT STEERING WHEEL AND LIGHTS WENT OFF AND ON. THEY KEPT THE VEHICLE OVERNIGHT AND REPAIRED A BROKEN HARNESS IN THE STEERING COLUMN. WHEN I ASKED HOW THIS HARNESS GOT BROKEN, THEY SAID IT'S COMMON IN RANGERS AND OCCASIONALLY IN F-150'S. I ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PART AND THEY COULDN'T FIND IT. THEY CHARGED ME $131.13 AND SAID IF I HAD ANY ISSUES WITH THIS TO CALL THE CUSTOMER CARE CENTER FOR FORD. THEY WERE OF NO HELP. I CALLED 3 OTHER FORD DEALERSHIPS AND ASKED IF THEY WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEM.  ONE HAD NEVER HEARD OF IT AND SUGGESTED I CALL THE MANAGER OF COMMUNITY FORD. ANOTHER HAD HEARD OF IT ,BUT NEVER SEEN IT,AND THE THIRD HAD SEEN IT ONCE.  I ASKED THE CUSTOMER CARE PEOPLE WHY THERE WASN'T A RECALL ON THIS, AND THEY SAID IT WASN'T A SAFETY ISSUE, ONLY FIRES WERE CONSIDER SAFETY ISSUES.   I'M SORRY I HAVE A MAJOR ISSUE WITH THIS. IF THEY ARE PRODUCING VEHICLES THAT CAN LOSE BREAK LIGHTS AND TURN SIGNALS WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD,THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE!!!!!I AM WRITING A LETTER TO FORD MOTOR COMPANY,A ND I WILL NOT CALL THE MANAGER OF COMMUNITY FORD,THEY'VE ALREADY LET ME KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO HELP.

IN ADDITION TO THE ENGINE/HOOD, ETC. DISAPPEARING IN THE FIRE, THE BATTERY BLEW UP AND THERE IS LEAD ALL OVER OUR HOUSE, YARD, AS WELL AS ANTI-FREEZE SOAKED INTO THE GRAVEL DRIVEWAY.  CERTAINLY AN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD TO OUR FAMILY WHICH INCLUDES THREE DOGS.  ALSO A PROBLEM FOR THE NEIGHBOR DOGS.   FORD MOTOR COMPANY WAS INFORMED AND ON 3-1-05 I WAS GIVEN THE OPTION OF LETTING MY INSURANCE HANDLE IT OR HAVING THE CAR TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP [ANOTHER EXPENSE] AND HAVING THEM EVALUATE IF IT IS A MECHANICAL DEFECT.  IF IT IS FORD WOULD GIVE ME TRADE-IN VALUE.  OBVIOUSLY I CANNOT REPLACE THE CAR FOR THE TRADE-IN VALUE.  FORD MOTOR COMPANY ACCEPTS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLEAN UP OF MY HOUSE AND DRIVEWAY.  *AK",

THIS FAILURE IS DUE TO A FAULTY MECHANICAL DESIGN OF THE 5.4L ALUMINUM HEADS THAT FORD PUTS ON IT'S 5.4L V8 TRUCKS. THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM ONLY ON LIGHTNINGS, IT IS INHERRENT TO ALL OF THE 5.4L HEADS. I AM A MEMBER OF SEVERAL MESSAGE BOARDS AND HAVE INCREASINGLY HEARD OF THIS PROBLEM WITH LIGHTNINGS AS WELL AS REGULAR F150'S. THE DESIGN OF THE HEAD IS FATALLY FLAWED. IT IS AN ALUMINUM HEAD, SO IT EXPANDS/CONTRACTS WITH HEAT, NOT TO MENTION THE SPARK PLUGS ARE STEEL THAT SCREW INTO THESE HEADS. THE BIGGEST FLAW ABOUT THEM IS THAT THEY ONLY HAVE3-4 THREADS TO HOLD IN THE SPARK PLUG(WHICH HAS 8-9 THREADS). THE SPARK PLUGS BASICALLY WORK THEIR WAY LOOSE AND EJECT FROM THE HOLE, RIPPING OUT THE REMAINING 2-3 THREADS, THUS CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO BE INOPERABLE AND RENDERING THE HEAD USELESS AND IN NEED OF REPLACEMENT. TO THIS DAY FORD REFUSES TO OFFICIALLY ADMIT THAT THIS PROBLEM EXISTS, EVEN THOUGH I COULD GO ONLINE AND FIND 50 INSTANCES OF THIS ISSUE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS. I PERSONALLY KNOW OF 4 OTHERS WITHIN 30 MILES OF ME THAT HAVE SUFFERED THIS SAME ISSUE. FORD DOES KNOW THE ISSUE EXISTS, BUT REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THEY HAVE COME OUT WITH A  REVISED HEAD THAT HAS THE MORE APPROPRIATE 8-9 THREADS. THEY CAME OUT WITH THIS IN LATE NOV '02. IT'S NICE THAT THE FUTURE 5.4L ENGINES WONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THIS ISSUE, HOWEVER THIS DOES LITTLE FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE ALREADY SHOT OUT A SPARK PLUG OR WILL IN THE NEAR FUTURE BECAUSE OF THIS FAULTY DESIGN. WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO MAKE THIS VERY WELL KNOWN ISSUE (AT LEAST INSIDE THE COMMUNITY) ABOUT THESE HEADS, BETTER KNOWN TO SOMEONE WHO COULD POSSIBLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WE WOULD LIKE FORD TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND  REPLACE THE FAULTY HEADS THAT HAVE SHOT OUT A PLUG AT THEIR EXPENSE UNDER WARRANTY.",
