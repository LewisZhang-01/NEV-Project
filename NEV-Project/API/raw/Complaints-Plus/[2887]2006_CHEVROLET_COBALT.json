Plus claimed it was throwing a code for a peddle that it needed. We just put a brand new peddle and brand new throttle body on it, it was idled to high, so reason for them getting it was to get the old ecm and new throttle sinked up to reduce the idle , at the time of it leaving me it started and ran just idle to high. Throwing no codes. They got it, claim it wouldn't start so did a diagnostic claimed it needed a new peddle. I said I'm coming to get it, they didn't tell me at any time I couldn't drive it home. I left there lot and pulled about 150 feet off the side of road because it wouldn't shift. Called them , botched did no good. Called same tow truck to tow it home. Got here it was idled normal but was throwing a different codes, I turned the car off it wouldn't stop running for about 3 to 4 minutes, then it died. I had it towed to different mechanic for the ignition to be replaced. He said it was throwing a couple codes still ignition not fixed yet, and it ran for about 15 minutes after shutting off the key. At no time here or at the new place did it throw a code for a defective peddle. So now it's be gone for 2 months , new ecm , new throttle body ,new peddle, idle is fixed and car runs but won't shift. Codes its throwing is now are just needing coil on #4 checked and throttle position sensor adjusted. So far that's it. 2 months later. Still not ready for pick up.",

I tried to turn the wheel more to the right but it was very hesitant and hard to do I ended up hitting the medium and it damaged the rear rim on that wheel and the tire afterwards just made a loud thumping noise it was a very scary situation. It was then I noticed it said power steering lit up on the dashboard nitro it back home and then the light on off and the steering was okay again which was very scary and strange it happened one more time when I was turning the corner and I almost hit someone because I could not turn the wheel like it normally turned it took a lot of effort this is a very scary situation as this is the only vehicle I have for transportation it's not normal do you have the steering just instantly either stop or is very hard to turn.

Sometimes when this happens, the steering wheel will become very difficult to move and it is almost impossible to turn. Sometimes the car will just buck when braking, sometimes the steering completely gives out. My car has even stalled and stopped running while driving - I am unsure if this is related to the problem. Any of these issues are extremely dangerous and could cause an accident. There is a recall on this vehicle for the power steering system, but Chevrolets own website claims my vehicle does NOT have any recalls (according to my VIN). I have never brought this car in for repair (for the recall) and to my knowledge, none of the previous owners have either. Upon researching, many others seem to have this problem as well with GM telling them their car does not have a recall. This has been going on for a long time, and no mechanic or anyone I bring it to can tell me what's wrong.",

ON 10/19/15 MY CAR WAS PARKED, WOULDN'T START AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON. THEN IT STARTED BUT DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH POWER TO MOVE/RUN. I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED - MILEAGE WAS 131,982 AT THE TIME.  BATTERY WAS GOOD. THE SHOP SAID IT HAD PO300 CODES - RANDOM MISFIRES. THEY FOUND CYLINDERS 2 AND 3 WERE NOT CONTRIBUTING POWER DUE TO A BAD IGNITION MODULE. SO THE IGNITION MODULE WAS REPLACED.  I ALSO HAD WORN SPARK PLUGS REPLACED, AS THE SHOP RECOMMENDED I DO SO. THE CAR STILL HAD MISFIRE CODES AND WOULD HESITATE WHEN RE-ACCELERATING AFTER STOPS, SO I PAID FOR A NEW FUEL FILTER AT THE REPAIR SHOP'S RECOMMENDATION.  THE HESITATION CONTINUED BUT I COULDN'T AFFORD FURTHER DIAGNOSTICS/REPAIRS. WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS OF REPAIR MY CAR LOST COMPLETE POWER WHILE I WAS DRIVING IN TRAFFIC. LUCKILY, OTHER DRIVERS HAD TIME/SPACE TO REACT, BUT IT COULD HAVE CAUSED A DEADLY ACCIDENT. DUE TO FINANCES, MY BROTHER CHECKED THE CAR FOR ME AND CLEANED THE THROTTLE BODY - THE ONLY ISSUE HE COULD DETECT. IT HAS RUN A BIT BETTER SINCE THEN, BUT STILL EXHIBITS HESITATION AFTER STOPS. I WORRY IT MAY LOSE COMPLETE POWER AGAIN BUT I CANT AFFORD INCURRING FURTHER EXPENSE WITH TRIAL AND ERROR REPAIRS. ESPECIALLY AFTER READING ONLINE OTHER COBALT OWNERS ARE HAVING THE SAME EXPERIENCE, AND HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET RESOLUTION DESPITE MULTIPLE EXPENSIVE TRIPS TO MECHANICS.  I FEEL CHEVROLET NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE THE ELECTRICAL/POWER LOSS ISSUES WITH COBALTS AND COVER NEEDED REPAIRS UNDER A RECALL SO COBALT OWNERS CAN DRIVE WITH PEACE OF MIND.

THE CAR WILL NOT CHANGE GEARS AND IS REALLY LOUD. THEY HAS US TO BRING IT BACK AND DID NOT AGAIN DO A DIAGNOSTIC TEST JUST SAY IN HIS OPINION THE AUTO NEEDS A NEW POWER STEERING MONITOR (POWER STEERING AFTER RECALL REPLACEMENT WENT OUT, DRIVES SLUGGISH LIKE IT IS GOING TO STOP IN TRAFFIC LIKE IT DID BEFORE THE RECALLS BUT WORSE. IT IS AS LOUD AS A 5TH WHEELER TRUCK, THEREFORE IT IS HARD TO HEARD EMERGENCY VEHICLES. NONE OF THESE SAFETY MATTER OR ISSUES WERE OCCURRING BEFORE THE RECALL PARTS WERE PUT ON. THE CAR WOULD STOP BUT WOULD START UP AND DRIVE HOWEVER IT HAD NONE OF THE PROBLEMS. THE AUTO WE ARE TOLD IF WE DRIVE LESS THAN 15 MPH WILL BE UNCONTROLLABLE. WE CANNOT CONTROL THE SPEED  NOW THEREFORE IT NOW DRIVES AT THE SLUGGISH GEAR. WE ARE SENIORS AND ARE AFRAID OF THE CAR. WE DID NOT KNOW THE DANGER OF RECALL BECAUSE THE CARDS ONLY STATED THE NAME OF THE PART. THE CAR AS I PREVIOUSLY STATED WOULD DRIVE BUT IN NO WAY HAS THESE PROBLEMS. THE STARTER PUT ON LAST YEAR IS AM EXAMPLE OF THE SAFETY ISSUES THAT ARE HIDDEN FROM US THEY REPLACED THE STARTER WE PAID FOR IT AND NEVER TOLD US IT WAS CAUSE BY A RECALL GAS LEAK UNTIL IT HAPPEN AGAIN IN AUG 2013.

I DON'T KNOW WHY AND I DON'T KNOW HOW. I JUST KNOW, THE CAR TURNS OFF. THIS HAS BEEN A DAILY BATTLE FOR ME. IT STARTED A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THE RECALL WAS RELEASED AND CONTINUES TO THIS DAY. I WAS DRIVING ACROSS AN INTERSECTION, THE LIGHT JUST TURNED GREEN, A FEW CARS IN FRONT OF ME. I PRESS THE GAS SLIGHTLY & MY CAR TURNS OFF. I WASN'T EVEN GOING 10 MPH. I WASN'T EVEN GOING MORE THAN 5! ANOTHER INCIDENT A FEW DAYS PRIOR, I WAS COMING TO ANOTHER INTERSECTION AND ANOTHER CAR IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WAS MAKING A LEFT SO HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION. THANKFULLY I WAS NOT GOING SO FAST THAT I COULD'VE STOPPED AND HE COULD'VE PASSED. JUST AS I WAS APPROACHING THE LINES TO CROSS INTO THE INTERSECTION, MY CAR TURNED OFF AGAIN. MY CAR IS CONSTANTLY TURNING OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC. THANKFULLY IT'S TRAFFIC SO IT'S GOING SLOW BUT IT HAS HAPPENED THAT MY CAR WILL JUST TURN OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF ME ACTUALLY DRIVING! THERE HAVE BEEN MANY TIMES THAT I AM TRYING TO MAKE A TURN AND MY CAR TURNS OFF. MID TURN! IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.DO YOU KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THAT IS? IT JUST REMINDS ME OF THOSE MOVIES WHERE THOSE SILLY PEOPLE GET STUCK ON TRAIN TRACKS. WHY WOULD YOU PARK OR STAY ON A TRAIN TRACK? OH, I KNOW, JUST OWN A CHEVROLET! IT'LL CONSTANTLY TURN OFF. THANKFULLY, I HAVE NOT GOTTEN STUCK ON A TRAIN TRACK BUT WHAT I HAVE ENCOUNTERED IS JUST AS DANGEROUS. I AM CONSTANTLY DRIVING AROUND WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND CHILDREN. MY CAR CONSTANTLY TURNING OFF, ESPECIALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET IS A GREAT HAZARD TO MYSELF AND MY PASSENGERS. I FEAR MY LIFE DRIVING THIS CAR. :(  *TR",

I HAVE CALLED SEVERAL TIMES FOR UPDATES, AND HAVE BEEN TOLD UP TO 800 PEOPLE WERE AHEAD OF ME FOR REPAIRS.    WHEN I REPORTED THIS INCIDENT TO GM VIA THE IGNITION SWITCH RECALL HOTLINE, THEY SUDDENLY FOUND THE PARTS NEEDED TO REPAIR MY CAR. THIS IS SUSPECT TO ME. THEY ARE ALSO CLAIMING THAT THIS INCIDENT WAS NOT IGNITION SWITCH RELATED, BUT THE FACT REMAINS THAT THIS WAS A NEAR-MISS INCIDENT WITH POTENTIAL CATASTROPHIC IMPLICATIONS THAT FITS ALL DESCRIPTIONS OF IGNITION SWITCH FAILURES. I HAVE FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS BY GM TO DRIVE WITH ONLY THE KEY IN THE IGNITION AND TO AVOID BUMPY ROADS, BUT THIS INCIDENTS HAS MADE ME FEEL EXTREMELY UNSAFE TO DRIVE THIS CAR.     GM IS NOT TREATING THIS DEFECT IN THE IGNITION SWITCH AS SERIOUSLY AS IT NEEDS TO, AS THE POSSIBILITY FOR SEVERE INJURY/LOSS OF LIGHT IS GREAT. THERE IS NO WARNING THAT POWER WILL BE LOST. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS CAR KNOWING THAT GM KNEW ABOUT THIS DEFECT FOR OVER A DECADE AND IS INSISTING THAT CARS WITH THE DEFECT ARE SAFE TO DRIVE.  *TR",

MY CAR MILEAGE IS NOT QUITE 170,000 MILEAGES, I BOUGHT THIS CAR BRAND NEW IN PENNSYLVANIA. THIS VEHICLE HAD THE MOTOR REPLACED FOR THE STEERING RECALL, AND THAT LASTED APPROXIMATELY 5,000 MILES AND THE STEERING DOES THE SAME THING, SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING IS BEING CRANKING WHEN TURNING THE CAR. THIS CAR HAS ALWAYS MADE A LOT OF NOISE IN THE FRONT END, ESPECIALLY THE PASSENGER FRONT END, SINCE IT WAS BOUGHT WITH NO MILES.  *TR",

WITNESSES TO HIS ACCIDENT REPORT THAT AFTER HE PASSED A CAMPER AT A NORMAL SPEED FOR THAT HIGHWAY AND BEGAN TO PULL BACK IN FRONT OF IT, HIS CAR ABRUPTLY VEERED OFF THE LANE AND ONTO THE RIGHT SHOULDER, WHERE HE LOST CONTROL.  THE CAR FISHTAILED, SKIDDED BACK ONTO THE HIGHWAY, AND ROLLED OVER SEVERAL TIMES.

ALL WHO SAW THE ACCIDENT WERE AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN HOW OR WHY IT OCCURRED.  MY HUSBAND WAS AN EXPERIENCED AND VERY CAREFUL DRIVER, IN GOOD HEALTH AND ALERT THAT MORNING.

SO, I BROUGHT IT IN TO HAVE PROBLEM FIXED  IT WAS THE LOWER TIE ARMS AND SOMETHING ELSE WENT BAD AND COST ME ALMOST $1000 TO FIX.

WHEN I CALLED BACK THE THIRD TIME THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TOLD ME I NEEDED TO BRING THE CAR IN AND HAVE THEM RESET IT FOR 300$. BEING AS THOUGHT I JUST SPENT 300$ ON THE BCM I DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY.  I BOUGHT THE COBALT BECAUSE IT WAS A CHEVY AND A SMALL RELIABLE CAR. I WAS ALSO A COLLEGE STUDENT SO THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.  SINCE THE RECALL FOR THE IGNITION SWITCH HAS COME OUT, I CALLED THE KOONS DEALERSHIP AND ASKED ABOUT A REFUND ON THE BCM BECAUSE THAT OBVIOUSLY WASN'T THE PROBLEM. THEY TOLD ME I WAS OUT OF LUCK AND THEY WEREN'T GOING TO HELP ME. NOW, I HAVE A DEATH TRAP, IM OUT THE MONEY FOR THE BCM, AND I DON'T HAVE MONEY FOR A NEW CAR. THANKS FOR STICKING IT TO YOUR CUSTOMERS GM! I WILL NEVER BY ANOTHER GM.  *TR",

WE ARE A MILITARY FAMILY AND SINCE WE BOUGHT THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE IN 2005, WE HAVE HAD TO MOVE FIVE TIMES DUE TO MILITARY ORDERS. ALL OF THOSE MOVES WERE ACROSS COUNTRY, FROM WEST COAST TO EAST COAST, BACK TO WEST COAST AND IN THE LAST MOVE FROM WEST COAST TO THE MIDWEST.

IN JANUARY OF 2013 MY GEAR SHIFT ASSEMBLY WENT OUT LUCKILY AFTER I WAS DONE DRIVING AND IN THE PROCESS OF PARKING WHICH RESULTED IN MY KEYS GETTING LOCKED IN THE IGNITION. A MONTH LATER MY SWITCH BOARD STOPPED WORKING IN MY STEERING WHEEL WHICH TURNS OFF MY SIGNALS WHEN I TURN AND MY KEYS STILL OCCASIONALLY GET LOCKED IN MY IGNITION. MY O2 SENSOR JUST WENT OUT, SHORTLY AFTER I GOT THE CAR I LEARNED ONE OF MY VALVE COVERS IS LEAKING OIL,  AND I JUST REPLACED MY IGNITION COIL PACK!

I AM A SINGLE MOM AND VALUE ME AND MY CHILD'S SAFETY BUT AT THIS TIME THE NO REPAIRS HAVE BEEN MADE DUE TO THE OBSCENE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN QUESTION TO REPAIR IT AND ONGOING FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS. I AM FILING THIS COMPLAINT BECAUSE I FEEL THIS PROBLEM CAN LEAD TO A MORE SERIOUS ISSUE AND MAY BE A PART OF A BIGGER ISSUE.   *TR",

THIS PROBLEM HAS CAUSED ME MAJOR DISTRESS AND COULD BE VERY UNSAFE IF THE CAR HAD EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM SOMEWHERE AWAY FROM HOME. I FOUND OUT HOW TO FIX IT BY READING ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET. MANY PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED THIS PROBLEM AND CHEVROLET HAS NOT LISTENED TO THE CONSUMERS BY ISSUING A RECALL AND REPAIRING THE PROBLEM.

THE NOTICE STATED ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS OF THE CONDITION WAS \"A NOTICEABLE FUEL ODOR WHILE THE VEHICLE IS BEING DRIVEN OR AFTER IT IS PARKED.\" IT STATED \"FUEL VAPORS, IN THE PRESENCE OF AN IGNITION SOURCE, COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE A VEHICLE FIRE.\" MY DAUGHTER, WIFE AND I HAD STARTED SMELLING GASOLINE EVERY TIME MY DAUGHTER PARKED IN THE GARAGE. MY DAUGHTER IS THE PRIMARY DRIVER AND SHE OFTEN HAS OUR 2 YR OLD GRANDSON IN THE CAR WITH HER. I DID AS THE LETTER INSTRUCTED AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH A CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP. I TOOK THE CAR TO JOHNNY LONDOFF CHEVROLET IN FLORISSANT, MO ON 9/11/13. AFTER SPENDING CLOSE TO 3 HOURS WAITING FOR THE CAR, I WENT HOME AND STILL SMELLED GASOLINE WHEN I PARKED IN THE GARAGE. I LOOKED AT THE INVOICE TO DETERMINE WHAT THEY'D DONE, AND IT SAID NO PROBLEM FOUND. WHEN I CALLED THE SERVICE CENTER, THE ADVISOR/TECHNICIAN STATED I \"THINK\" I SMELL GAS. IF THAT'S THE CASE, THERE ARE THREE OF US WHO \"THINK\" WE SMELL GAS. ALTHOUGH CHEVROLET SENT THE LETTER, APPARENTLY THEY DON'T WANT TO FIX THE PROBLEM. IF THIS HAPPENED TO ME, I CAN ONLY WONDER HOW MANY OTHER CUSTOMERS HAVE IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM AND WERE TOLD THERE WAS NO PROBLEM? I'M EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF MY DAUGHTER AND GRANDSON.  *TR",

A FEW HOURS LATER, DRIVER SIDE DOOR OPENS AFTER ANOTHER ATTEMPT FROM OUTSIDE. ONCE INSIDE THE VEHICLE, THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR WOULD NOT LATCH SHUT. VEHICLE COULD NOT BE DRIVEN UNTIL DOOR LATCHED SHUT NEARLY 45 MINUTES LATER.    INCIDENT #1 HAS HAPPENED ONLY ONCE. INCIDENT #2 HAS HAPPENED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS.

MY THING IS IF THEY ARE HAVING THIS MUCH  TROUBLE WITH THE POWER STEERING ON THIS CAR, WHICH THEY ARE, I SHOULD BE NO WHERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR MISTAKE THEY MADE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. INSTEAD I PAY OVER $8000 FOR A CAR I EXPECT TO LAST LONGER THAN 3 MONTHS WITHOUT PUMPING MONEY INTO IT LAST AND I HAVE TO REFIX A RECALL THAT DIDN'T WORK TO BEGIN WITH. SOME WHERE SOME HOW SOMEONE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE AND I DON'T FEEL THAT IT SHOULD BE ME.  *TR",

THE FIRST INVOLVED THE STEERING PROBLEM,WHICH WAS EVENTUALLY RECALLED, BUT NOT UNTIL I SPENT SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS, FOR WHICH I STILL HAVE NOT BEEN REIMBURSED.      ON JULY 21, 2011, WHICH HIT OVER 100 DEGREES INN CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA, I BEGAN SMELLING GASOLINE AFTER DRIVING THE VEHICLE.  I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE RELATED TO THE FACT THAT WE WERE UNDER AN OZONE ACTION ALERT, BUT WHEN THE PROBLEM DID NOT RESOLVE AND BECAME WORSE I CONTACTED THE DEALER.  LIKE MANY OTHER CHEVY COBALT, SATURN ION, AND PONTIAC GS OWNERS, I WAS TOLD THAT THE ODOR WAS COMING FROM A LEAKY FUEL PUMP.  DESPITE MY ATTEMPTS TO GET THE PROBLEM RESOLVED, I WAS TOLD THAT MY VEHICLE WAS NOT AMONG THE LIMITED VIN NUMBERS THAT QUALIFIED UNDER A VOLUNTARY RECALL CAMPAIGN #09V419000 NOR DID I LIVE IN ONE OF THE STATES THAT QUALIFIED.  MY DEALER TOLD ME THAT I MIGHT HAVE A CASE TO FILE FOR SPECIAL COVERAGE ADJUSTMENT #09275A. WHICH DID INCLUDE MY VIN,, BUT MY MILEAGE WAS TOO HIGH.  AS A RESULT, I HAD TO SPEND ANOTHER $496.27 TO TAKE CARE OF THE  PROBLEM MYSELF, AND THAT WAS WITH A COURTESY DISCOUNT FROM THE DEALER.    WHILE I FULLY UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT THAT EVEN GOOD PARTS WILL EVENTUALLY WEAR OUT, IT IS STILL NOT UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT A KNOWN FAILURE OF A PARTICULAR PART SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF.  IF OTHER DRIVERS RECEIVE THE BENEFITS OF HAVING A FAULTY PART REPLACED, ALL DRIVERS WHO EXPERIENCE THE PROBLEM SHOULD REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE AND WHAT THE VEHICLE'S MILEAGE IS WHEN THE FAILURE OCCURS.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN THAT PROBLEM CAN RESULT IN INJURY OR DEATH SUCH AS A FIRE THAT MIGHT OCCUR FROM LEAKING FUEL OR HAVING STEERING GO OUT WHILE DRIVING.  MY DEALER WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY FINE WITH ALLOWING ME TO DRIVE OFF THE SERVICE LOT WITHOUT THE FIX IF I WASN'T ABLE TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY.  I HAVE BEEN A CHEVY OWNER FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS, BUT THIS MAY BE MY LAST CHEVY PURCHASE.  *TR",

THE WARNING SYSTEM IS NOT RELIABLE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T ALWAYS GIVE WARNING OF THE FAILURE, AND SOMETIMES IT DINGS AND NO FAILURE OCCURS.  WHEN MALFUNCTIONING THE STEERING IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO USE.  A GREAT AMOUNT OF FORCE IS REQUIRED TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL. THE PROBLEM MAY OCCUR AT ANY TIME AND AT ANY SPEED.  THEN WHEN THE STEERING IS LOCKED IT OFTEN FREES UP SPONTANEOUSLY! THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS!!! THIS IS MY SECOND COMPLAINT.  WE PURCHASED OUR 2006 CHEVY COBALT NEW AND AT ABOUT 23K MILES WE BEGAN TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE POWER STEERING.  THE POWER STEERING ASSIST MOTOR HAS BEEN REPLACED SEVERAL TIMES AND THE COLUMN WAS ALSO REPLACED.  WE JUST HAD THE PSA MOTOR REPLACED THROUGH THE RECALL FOR THE SECOND TIME.  OUR PARTICULAR CAR WAS NOT EVEN LISTED IN THE RECALL BUT THE DEALERSHIP DID THE REPAIRS BECAUSE OF OUR LONGTERM ISSUE.  I BELIEVE THERE MUST BE SOME OTHER PART CAUSING THE PROBLEM (SPORADIC AND UNRELIABLE STEERING) BECAUSE THE PSA MOTOR HAS BEEN REPLACED SEVERAL TIMES BUT THE PROBLEM CONTINUES TO REOCCUR.  NOW OUR CAR HAS HIGH MILEAGE AND GM IS UNWILLING TO \"DO\" ANYTHING TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.  WE HAVE BEEN PAYING FOR THIS DEFECTIVE AND DANGEROUS CAR FOR 4 YEARS NOW AND THE PROBLEM HAS STILL NOT BEEN RESOLVED! I'M AFRAID THIS ISSUE WILL CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH, IT MUST BE FIXED!

I WAS TOLD THAT EVEN THOUGH THE CAR SAT FOR 2 MONTHS WITH A DEAD BATTERY THE COMPUTER DOES NOT LOOSE DATA. (G.M.) I KNOW OF SEVERAL COBALT OWNERS WHO HAVE HAD THE POWER ASSIST REPLACED ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION AND IT STILL WENT OUT.

REPAIRS WERE $760.  FUEL PUMP MODULE WAS REPLACED AFTER DIAGNOSTICS AND HAVING THE TANK DROPPED.  PART AVAILABLE.  EXACT DESCRIPTION OF PROBLEM FALLS UNDER THE NHTSA CAMPAIGN 09V419000 RECALL.  CAR IS NOT IN RECALL STATE, BUT ISSUE HAS BEEN INDICATED TO BE RELATED TO HIGH HEAT.  HEAT IN CURRENT STATE (WV) HAS BEEN 90+ DEGREES FOR MORE THAN 2 MONTHS.  DEALER DID NOT LOOK AT RECALL, ONLY AT THE VIS WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE MY CAR'S VIN, APPARENTLY.  THIS IS AN EXTREME SAFETY ISSUE, AND SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL 2006 CHEVY COBALTS WHO HAVE SIMILAR PARTS IN THEIR CAR.  THE STATE SPECIFIC RECALL HAS BEEN INDICATED IN NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABUNDANT ON THE INTERNET TO BE A FALSE, AS PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED NATIONWIDE.  GM CLAIMS THAT SAFETY IS THEIR NUMBER ONE CONCERN, BUT THEY DO NOT (ACCORDING TO THE REP I SPOKE WITH ) HAVE AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER THEY SHOULD EXPAND THIS RECALL INTO OTHER STATES.  THIS IS APPALLING AND NEEDS LOOKED INTO BY SOMEONE WHO HAS THE CONSUMER'S SAFETY IN THEIR BEST INTEREST. *TR",

I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE THEY COULD FIX IT UNDER THE WARRANTY BEFORE THE RECALL THAT THEY SAID THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT WENT INTO AFFECT. THEY TOLD ME TO GET A DIAGNOSTIC TEST WHICH COST 100 DOLLARS OUT OF MY POCKET WHICH I DID. STILL NO RESULT, NOW WE HAVE A RECALL 2 MONTHS AFTER THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD NOT FIX MY CAR. THE THING THAT TROUBLES ME NOW IS THAT THERE IS ANOTHER LIE BEING TOLD BECAUSE THE  DIAGNOSTIC TEST SAYS THAT THERE IS 2 THINGS THAT SHOULD BE FIXED NOT JUST ONE, THE CHEAPEST ONE,  THE RECALL IS ONLY GOING TO FIX THE MOTOR . THE COLUMN  IS ALSO SUPPOSE TO BE FIXED BECAUSE THE MOTOR WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM ALTOGETHER IT IS JUST A BANDAID SORT OF THING. THIS IS WHAT THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT GM REQUIRED BEFORE THE RECALL. THIS IS ABOUT A $1500 PROBLEM .WHY ARE THEY NOT GOING TO FIX ALL OF IT LIKE THEY SAID IT REQUIRED BEFORE RECALL. IT GOES OUT WHEN YOU GET TO 10 OR 15 MPH AND STAYS OUT UNTIL CAR IS SHUT OFF.  THEY ARE LYING ABOUT WHEN IT HAPPENS, IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME WHO ONLY DRIVES 10MPH IMPOSSIBLE!

THE REASON I AM FILING A COMPLAINT IS IN FEBRUARY I HAD A PROBLEM WITH AN INCREDIBLY STRONG GAS ODOR FILLING THE CABIN OF MY CAR AND SO I WENT TO THE DEALER I PURCHASED IT FROM AND THEY FOUND THAT THE FUEL PUMP MODULE NEEDED REPLACING.  THEY DID THE REPAIR WORK AND CHARGED ME A TOTAL OF $558.89 FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE PUMP.  I AM AWARE THAT THERE IS A RECALL FOR 2006 COBALTS FOR FAULTY FUEL PUMP MODULES (RECALL #09226).

THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT INFORMED ME THAT THERE HAS BEEN MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THE COBALTS STEERING AND THERE IS 1.3 MILLION CHEVY & PONTIAC CARS THAT HAVE A STEERING ISSUES BUT THERE IS NOTHING THEY COULD DO FOR ME BUT BUY A NEW ASSEMBLY AT $367.00 PLUS LABOR TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  GM MIGHT RECALL THE PROBLEM.  THE STEERING HAS LOCKED UP ON ME TODAY AFTER THE GM DEALER SAID IT WAS OK TO DRIVE.  THANK GOD I WAS NO GOING AT A LOW SPEED.  I HOPE THAT NOBODY GETS KILLED.  I HAVE PARKED THE CAR UNTIL I CAN HAVE A NEW ASSEMBLY INSTALLED BY THE REPAIR GARAGE.  THE ASSEMBLY IS A SPECIAL ORDER FROM A  GM DEALER.  THIS ALSO TAKES A TOLL ON THE TIRES AND FRONT END. *TR",

THEY REPLACED THE PLASTICE BOTTLE BUT THE CAR KEPT OVERHEATING.  OUT OF FRUSTRATION I TOOK MY CAR TO ANOTHER REPAIR SHOP.

IS THERE SOMETHING I CAN DO TO FIND OUT IF THERE IS A RECALL OR GOING TO BE ONE? I WOULD CERTAINLY THINK THAT THIS SHOULD BE CORRECTED BY GM BECAUSE ITS A FACTORY DEFAULT AND NOT WEAR AND TEAR. *TR",

I READ THAT OFTEN TIMES TURNING THE CAR OFF AND THEN BACK ON WILL \"RESET\" IT. I WENT OUT AND TRIED IT AND IT WORKED.

IT HAS BEEN A WEEK NOW SINCE I FIRST STARTED HAVING THE ISSUE AND IT HAS PROGRESSIVELY GOTTEN WORSE WITH EACH DAY OF DRIVING, GOING FROM LASTING 10 MINUTES BEFORE FAILURE, TO LASTING ONLY 15-30 SECONDS. AFTER THE 3RD DAY I FINALLY GAVE UP ON IT AND BEGAN DRIVING MY OLDER MUCH MORE RELIABLE, DEPENDABLE CHEVY CAVALIER. TODAY I AM TAKING THE COBALT TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIRS. I WAS QUOTED A PRICE BETWEEN $450-$600 TO REPAIR. I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH GM AS WELL. THE MECHANIC AT THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT THEY WERE WELL AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND HE SEES AT LEAST ONE IN PER MONTH WITH THE SAME ISSUE. THIS IS NOT VERY SAFE AND IS OBVIOUSLY A MAJOR ISSUE.

WHILE DRIVING THIS PAST FALL, MY HUSBAND HEARD DINGING SOUNDS, LOOKED DOWN, AND THE SCREEN SAID THE POWER STEERING FAILED.  SURE ENOUGH, THERE WAS NO POWER STEERING.  THE MANUAL SAYS TO SHUT OFF ENGINE, RESTART, AND ROCK THE STEERING WHEEL.  EVERY TIME WE RESTART, THE POWER STEERING COMES BACK ON, BUT ONLY FOR A VERY SHORT TIME.  AS SOON AS WE DRIVE 20 FEET, IT GOES OUT AGAIN.  THIS HAPPENS FOR US WHILE DRIVING AT ANY SPEED - COULD BE GOING 55 MILES AN HOUR DOWN THE ROAD, COULD BE WHILE GOING AROUND A TURN.   WE LIVE IN WEST VIRGINIA WITH MOUNTAINS AND SHARP TURNS, AND THIS POSES A SERIOUS DANGER.  IF WE LOSE POWER STEERING GOING AROUND A BIG TURN, WE'RE IN TROUBLE.  I'VE READ REPORTS OF POWER STEERING FAILING AT SLOW SPEEDS.  HOWEVER, THIS IS CERTAINLY NOT THE CASE FOR US.  IT WILL GO OUT AT ANY SPEED, AND THE MORE YOU RESTART THE ENGINE, THE MORE IT CONTINUES TO GO OUT.  WE TOOK THE CAR TO THE PLACE OF PURCHASE TO SEE HOW MUCH IT WOULD BE TO REPAIR, AND THEY TOLD US THAT THEY COULDN'T FIX IT THERE OR GUARANTEE IT IF THEY DID TRY TO FIX IT.  BUT THE COST COULD BE AS MUCH AS $1100 OR MORE.  WELL, I DON'T HAVE $1100 TO FIX THE NEWEST VEHICLE I OWN, IT'S VERY DANGEROUS THE WAY IT IS, AND SO THE CAR HAS BEEN SITTING FOR THE PAST 6 MONTHS.  I COULDN'T BE MORE TICKLED IF CHEVY HAD TO CORRECT THEIR MISTAKES AND FIX MY CAR FOR NO CHARGE.  IF WE HAD KNOWN THAT EVERYTHING IN THIS CAR IS ELECTRICAL AND HAD NO STEERING FLUID, WE WOULD NEVER HAVE PURCHASED OUR \"FIRST-EVER\" CHEVY TO BEGIN WITH.  NEXT TIME WE'LL STICK WITH FORD.

THE CAR DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A SECURITY SYSTEM.  WE TOOK IT TO THE GM DEALER WHO \"FIXED\" THE PROBLEM BY TEARING INTO THE STEERING COLUMN AND CLEANING ALL OF THE PLUGS.  IT WORKS FINE FOR A FEW MONTHS, THEN IT DID IT AGAIN.  THEY THEN DID THE SAME THING AND CLEANED THE PLUGS.  THE THIRD TIME WE TOOK IT BACK THEY REPLACED THE STEERING COLUMN AND IT WAS GOOD FOR ABOUT A YEAR.  IT BEGAN ACTING UP AGAIN AND WE TOOK IT BACK AND THEY CLEANED THE PLUGS AGAIN.  AFTER YEARS OF FRUSTRATION AND COMPLAINING, WE FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT CONTROLS IT.  WHEN YOU OPERATE THE TILT WHEEL IT WILL EITHER FIX OR HINDER THE PROBLEM WORSE OR BETTER THAN WHAT IT IS AT THE TIME.  I SAW THAT NHTSA IS LOOKING INTO THIS AND I WANTED TO FILE A COMPLAINT AS WELL AS EVERYONE ELSE TO LET THEM KNOW I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THE ELECTRONIC ASSIST STEERING.     THERE WAS A POINT WHERE YOU COULD BE GOING DOWN HIGHWAY AND GOING AROUND A TURN AND THE POWER STEERING WOULDN'T' BE WORKING, AND IT WOULD KICK IN AND OUT JERKING THE WHEEL.  MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR THE DRIVE TO KEEP THE VEHICLE IN ITS OWN LANE.  IN ADDITION TO BEING HARD TO PARK, THIS IS A HORRID SYSTEM.  I WILL NEVER BUY A COBALT AGAIN DUE TO THIS SAFETY ISSUE, IT ALMOST FORCED ME TO WRECK GOING DOWN THE HIGHWAY. *TR",

WHEN THE ASSIST WAS OFF, IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO MOVE THE STEERING WHEEL.  I HAVE OWNED THE CAR ALMOST 4 YEARS AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE NOTICED THE LOSS OF POWER ASSIST STEERING.

THIS PROBLEM COST ME $208.82. ON JAN 2009 THE HORN WAS REPLACED (IT HAD STOPPED WORKING 2 MONTHS PRIOR). THIS COST ME $58.85. THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS THE POWER STEERING. THE LIGHT CAME ON AROUND AUG OR SEPT OF 2009. THE STEERING WHEEL GETS HARD AND IT'S VERY HARD TO MANEUVER, SPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO TURN INTO A PARKING SPACE. I HAD THE CAR CHECKED BY TWO DIFFERENT MECHANIC SHOPS AND THEY BOTH SAID IT NEEDS THE POWER STEERING MODULE REPLACED. THIS PIECE COST AROUND $470. PLUS LABOR. THE FIRST MECHANIC CHECKED IT ON JAN 23, 2010 AND BOUGHT THE POWER STEERING MOTOR ($175.00)FROM THE CHEVY DEALER AND REPLACED IT. THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTED AND HE KEPT THE CAR FOR TWO DAYS TO CHECK IF MAYBE IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE. HE CONCLUDED IT WAS THE STEERING COLUMN THAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. HE RETURNED THE MOTOR AND NOW WAS TOLD THAT THEY (CHEVY) DID NOT SELL THE MOTOR BY ITSELF, THAT HE NEEDED TO BUY THE WHOLE MODULE, WHICH IS $470.00.  THE FIRST 2 MONTHS I WOULD TURN OFF THE CAR AND IT WOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN, BUT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF DEC 2009, EVEN WHEN I TURN OFF THE CAR AND THEN TURN IT ON AGAIN, THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKS UP AND IT STAYS THAT WAY THE WHOLE TIME YOU ARE DRIVING. IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY, EVERYTIME I TURN ON THE CAR. THIS IS A PAIN BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO MANEUVER THE CAR, BUT IT IS ALSO VERY DANGEROUS, BECAUSE IF I HAD TO MAKE A QUICK TURN, I COULDN'T DO SO, AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY END UP IN AN ACCIDENT. *TR",

THE GENTLEMEN INFORMED ME THE POWER STEERING HAD INDEED GONE OUT AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED BUT WASN'T COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. HE ALLOWED ME TO DRIVE BACK TO WHERE I'M STATIONED AT BECAUSE I'M NOT OLD ENOUGH TO RENT A CAR AND NEEDED TO REPORT OFF LEAVE. ON THE WAY BACK MY POWER STEERING WENT OFF AND THIS TIME AFTER I RESTARTED MY CAR IT WENT OUT AGAIN AFTER ABOUT 30 SECONDS. WHEN I RETURNED TO MY BASE I TOOK IT TO A LOCAL CHEVY DEALERSHIP AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE REPAIR WOULD COST BETWEEN $1000 TO $1200.

HAS SUED A SUPPLIER, SAYING IT HAS SPENT MORE THAN $30 MILLION FIXING PROBLEMS IN THE STEERING SYSTEMS OF THE CHEVROLET COBALT, ITS BEST-SELLING SMALL CAR, AND OTHER VEHICLES.    GM SAID CUSTOMERS HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT UNUSUAL RATTLES, \"CLUNKS\" AND OTHER NOISES. IT PINPOINTED THE FLAW TO \"EXCESSIVE GEAR BACKLASH,\" WHICH CAUSES PROBLEMS IN THE STEERING COLUMN UNDER CERTAIN DRIVING CONDITIONS.    THE LAWSUIT NAMES JTEKT NORTH AMERICA INC., BASED IN PLYMOUTH, MICH., AND AN AFFILIATED COMPANY, JTEKT AUTOMOTIVE VIRGINIA INC. OF DALEVILLE, VA.    GM SAID IT WANTS TO BE PAID FOR REPLACING THOUSANDS OF PARTS UNDER CUSTOMER WARRANTY CLAIMS ON THE COBALT, PURSUIT, G5, HHR AND OTHER CARS, STARTING WITH 2005 MODEL YEAR.    BY FALL, THE COST HAD EXCEEDED $30 MILLION, AND \"GM'S DAMAGES ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS ADDITIONAL WARRANTY CLAIMS ARE MADE,\" THE AUTOMAKER'S LAWSUIT SAID.    \"JTEKT CONTENDS THE COMPONENTS ALL MET THE SPECIFICATIONS AND TESTING REQUIREMENTS THAT GM GAVE IT,\" SAID BOB HADDAD, A LAWYER FOR THE SUPPLIER. \"THE ISSUES DO NOT AFFECT THE OPERATOR'S ABILITY TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE. THIS IS A NOISE ISSUE.\"    CHANGES WERE MADE AT GM'S REQUEST, AND JTEKT CONTINUES TO PROVIDE STEERING ASSEMBLIES, HADDAD SAID MONDAY.    THE STEERING SYSTEMS ARE IN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GM CARS. COURT PAPERS DO NOT INDICATE WHETHER THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THIS A SAFETY ISSUE. A GM SPOKESMAN, ALAN ADLER, HAD NO IMMEDIATE COMMENT.    THE LAWSUIT WAS FILED IN AUGUST IN MACOMB COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT, AMENDED THERE IN OCTOBER AND MOVED NOV. 17 TO FEDERAL COURT IN DETROIT. *TR",

DUE TO THE POOR ECONOMY WE CANNOT AFFORD TO FIX THE CAR, BUT YET WE PUT DOWN 3,000 ON THE VEHICLE AND WE CONTINUE TO BE STUCK WITH 350 CAR PAYMENTS EVERY MONTH FOR A VEHICLE WE CANNOT EVEN DRIVE. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS CAR, WE ARE EXTREMELY WORRIED ABOUT ANYONE THAT HAS ONE OF THESE CARS. THE CAR IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY WE ARE SPENDING ON IT. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE SITUATION AND WE ARE IN A HORRIBLE POSITION. *TR",

I CANT AFFORD ANOTHER CAR NOR CAN I AFFORD $1200 TO $2000 TO REPLACE THE WHOLE STEERING COLUMN.  RESEARCH ON THE NET INDICATES POSSIBLY 1000'S OF THESE CARS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  I CANT EVEN FANTOM MY WIFE DOING 65 MPH AND THIS HAPPENING TO HER.  THIS IS A RECURRING SAFETY HAZARD THAT COULD COST 100'S OF INNOCENT LIVES.  PLEASE FORCE GM TO RECTIFY THIS PROBLEM.  I'VE BEEN A GM OWNER FOR YEARS AND IF THEY TRULY WONT TO REMAIN IN BUSINESS THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT.

IT WORKS WHEN I CRANK THE CAR UP BUT AFTER ABOUT 1-2 MILES, THE POWER STEERING GOES OUT. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THAT IT NEEDED A STEERING COLUMN AND IT WOULD COST $1200.00 WHICH I COULD NOT AFFORD.  THEN LAST WEEK ON 08/02/2009, A LOT OF THINGS STOPPED WORKING. THE ODOMETER, CRUISE CONTROL, TEMP. GAUGE, AND SPEEDOMETER. AND THE CAR WOULD NOT CHANGE GEARS. SINCE IT STAYED IN A LOW GEAR I COULD ONLY DRIVE ABOUT 30 MPH TO TAKE IT TO THE SHOP. IT TURNED OUT THAT IT NEEDED A TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE AND IT COST $362. AFTER THAT EVERYTHING STARTED WORKING AGAIN EXCEPT THE POWER STEERING. I KNOW THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE AS THERE WERE OVER 500 COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE ISSUE ON THE ONE WEBSITE THAT I LOOKED AT AND THAT'S ONLY ONE WEBSITE (WWW.TOPIX.COM/FORUM/AUTOS/CHEVROLET-COBALT).

THIS WAS HAPPENING AS I WAS INCREASING MY SPEED CLOSE TO THE SPEED LIMIT OF 55 MILES AN HOUR. I ARRIVED TO MY DESTINATION WITH DIFFICULTY SINCE I HAVE NEVER DRIVEN A CAR WITHOUT POWER STEERING AND DRIVING IT TOOK A LOT OF EFFORT TO AVOID CRASHING IN THE PARKING LOT TRAFFIC.    AFTER I SHOPPED AT WAL-MART AND RETURNED TO MY CAR, I STARTED ENGINE AND RELIEVED THAT THE PROBLEM HAS DISAPPEARED. MUCH TO MY DISMAY, I WENT BACK TO ROUTE 40 UP TO 55 MILES AN HOUR AGAIN WITH THE POWER STEERING PROBLEM APPEARING AGAIN. BASED ON WHAT I'VE EXPERIENCED SO FAR, THE POWER STEERING SEEMS TO GET TURNED \"OFF\" DURING A LONG, STRAIGHT-AWAY DRIVE AT MORE THAN 50 MILES AN HOUR ON A HOT WEATHER. IT HAS HAPPENED TWICE TODAY AND I'M CONCERNED THAT IT MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AND AGAIN. THE DEFECT COULD ENDANGER MYSELF AND MY PASSENGERS IN THE EVENT THE POWER STEERING IS MUCH MORE NEEDED, ESPECIALLY IN LOW TRAFFIC SPEEDS. DURING LOW TRAFFIC SPEEDS, IT INCREASES THE RISK OF AN ACCIDENT DUE TO A MORE REQUIRED EFFORT TO STEER.    NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO IT YET AND I WILL BE CALLING MY CAR DEALERSHIP SOON TO SEE IF MY ZURICH VEHICLE CONTRACT COVERS THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING. SINCE GM'S WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED ALREADY, IT WILL NOT BE COVERED.  I HAVE SEARCHED THE WEB AND FOUND THAT COUNTLESS COBALT OWNERS ARE HAVING THE SIMILAR PROBLEMS, WHICH WORRIES ME. GENERAL MOTORS HASN'T STARTED A RECALL FOR THE DEFECT AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THE DEFECT CAN END UP BEING FATAL TO MANY OTHER COBALT OWNERS. I HOPE GENERAL MOTORS ISN'T BEING NEGLIGENT, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THEY ARE UNDER BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION.    I BOUGHT THE 2006 COBALT SS 4 MONTHS AGO USED AND I'VE ACCUMULATED 7000 MILES ON IT WITH AN ODOMETER READING OF ABOUT 67,400. IT WAS A GREAT CAR UNTIL I FIND OUT IT'S PRETTY UNSAFE WITH A RE-OCCURRING POWER STEERING PROBLEM. *TR",

I'M ONLY SAYING THIS BECAUSE I'M AFRAID THAT WHILE I'M GOING DOWN THE ROAD AND MYSELF OR A PASSENGER ACCIDENTALLY HITS THE STICK A LITTLE, THAT THE CAR WILL SWITCH INTO A DIFFERENT GEAR AND RUIN MY ENGINE OR CAUSE A WRECK.  *TR",

IN JULY 2008 I HAD MY FIRST PROBLEM WITH THE POWER STEERING. I WAS DRIVING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY AND THE POWER STEERING LIGHT CAME ON. THE CAR IMMEDIATELY STOPPED WORKING AFTER SHAKING FOR 2-3 SECONDS. I RE-STARTED THE ENGINE AND THE CAR MOVED BUT THE BRAKES WERE SHAKY AND IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS OUT OF GEAR. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER 2-3 DAYS LATER AND THEY REPLACED MY WHOLE STEERING COLUMN WITH A COST OF CLOSE TO $1000 AT THE TIME AS MY CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY. THE PROBLEM WENT AWAY FOR A FEW MONTHS BUT UNFORTUNATELY LAST NIGHT IT BEGAN AGAIN (DECEMBER 21). THE POWER STEERING LIGHT CAME ON AND THE VEHICLE STARTED SHAKING WHILE I WAS DRIVING AT 40 KM/H. I DID NOT LOSE CONTROL BUT IT MADE MY DRIVE REALLY DIFFICULT AS I WAS DRIVING ON ICY ROADS. SAME AS IN THE SUMMER THE BRAKES WERE SHAKY AND THE ENGINE WAS OUT OF GEAR AND ACCELERATING WAS HARD TO CONTROL. AFTER STOPPING AT A GAS STATION AND RE-STARTING THE ENGINE THE CAR WORKED FINE. I AM TAKING THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN, BUT I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW GM DOES NOT RECALL THIS CAR AS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE REPORT THE SAME PROBLEM. IT'S REALLY DANGEROUS TO HAVE THE POWER STEERING GO OFF RANDOMLY. AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THIS IS GOING TO COST NOW..

I BELIEVE A RECALL SHOULD BE DONE BECAUSE OF THE UNSAFE ISSUE WHILE DRIVING OR TURNING A VEHICLE AND LOSE CONTROL.  THIS PROBLEMS HAPPENS AT LEAST 3-4 TIMES A DAY AND SON JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO REPAIR. HE JUST JOINED THE ARMY IN SEPT. 4, 2008 AND IS GOING TO NEED HIS CAR IN VA. FOR HIS TRAINING. COULD YOU PLEASE PROVIDE A PUSH TO GM ON THIS ISSUE.. PLEASE!!  THANK YOU.. *TR",

A KNOCKING NOISE CAME FROM THE REAR OF THE CAR, IDLE SURGED,  AND CRUISE CONTROL FAILED TO DISENGAGE.    FAILURE & CONSEQUENCES: FIRE! COMPONENT THAT FAILED WAS A CANISTER/SENDING UNIT REAR OF THE GAS TANK WITH THE CONSEQUENCE OF A FIRE AND THE TOTAL LOSS OF MY 2006 CHEVROLET COBALT.

MY THOUGHTS WERE, WE'LL AT LEAST THEY CAN'T SAY THEY DON'T SMELL IT OR GIVE ME THE \"CAN'T DUPLICATE IT\" DECISION. I ONLY MADE IT HALFWAY WHEN MY CAR HAD A MAJOR ELECTRICAL/MECHANICAL FAILURE. I WAS ASSISTED BY CARS TRAVELING BEHIND ME AS ONE POINTED OUT MY CAR WAS ON FIRE AND THE CAR SHUT DOWN, ALL WITHOUT ANY WARNING LIGHTS! THE FIRE SEVERELY BURNED THE ENTIRE BACK HALF OF THE CAR.

I COULD NOT REMOVE THE KEY FROM THE IGNITION.  SINCE I HAD ANOTHER KEY, I TURNED THE MOTOR OFF AND LOCKED THE DOOR.  WHEN WE CAME BACK ABOUT AN HOUR LATER, I OPENED THE DOOR AND WAS ABLE TO REMOVE THE KEY.  THE DEALER STATES: \"THEY INSPECTED SHIFTER AND LOCK CYLINDER PER BULLETIN 06-07-30-004B AND WAS UNABLE TO VERIFY THE COMPLAINT...\"  THEN I STARTED THE CAR WITH MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND PUT IT IN REVERSE.  THE CAR LUNGED BACKWARDS, I PUT IT IN NEUTRAL AND THEN PARK, THEN PUT THE HAND BRAKE ON, BUT NOTHING WOULD STOP IT UNTIL IT HIT A TREE BRACE IN THE PARKING LOT.  THE DEALER STATED, \"UNABLE TO DUPLICATE BUT REPROGRAMMED THE PCM WITH UPDATED CALIBRATIONS J6354...\"  OF COURSE, THEY WOULD NOT REPAIR THE DAMAGE TO MY 7-DAY OLD CAR.  I AM LUCKY THERE WERE NO PEOPLE WALKING IN THE PARKING LOT AT THE TIME!!  I OBTAINED 3 APPRAISALS TO REPAIR THE DAMAGES, THE LOWEST BEING $790.91.  I BELIEVE GM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.  IT DEFINITELY WAS A SAFETY HAZARD AND I'M AFRAID IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.  THANK YOU.  *JB",

ON THE 25 OF OCTOBER WHILE DRIVING THE CAR THE TRANSMISSION STARTED TO GO OUT OF GEAR AND BACK IN CAUSING A JERKING MOTION AND WHEN I PULLED OVER THE MOTOR STOPPED. I HAD 675 MILES ON IT AT THAT TIME. YESTERDAY I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND THEY DROVE IT FOR A FEW MILES WITH NO PROBLEM. NO OTHER CHECK WAS MADE BY THE DEALER ON THE CAR.   *NM",
