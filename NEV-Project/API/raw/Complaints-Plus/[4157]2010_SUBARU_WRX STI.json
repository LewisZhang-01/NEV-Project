THIS AIR PUMP FAILED AND I LOOKED UP IF MY VEHICLE HAD THE RECALL DONE ON THIS SPECIFIC PART AND SUBARU SAID IT DID BUT IT FAILED AFTER BEING REPLACED IN 2016 AND THEY REFUSE TO FIX IT. I AM BELIEVING THAT IT IMPROPERLY FIXED CAUSING IT TO FAIL ONCE AGAIN. I ALSO SPOKE TO SUBARU OF AMERICA AND THEY ALSO REFUSED TO ASSIST IN THIS SITUATION. I AM IN DISBELIEF THAT THIS WAS THEIR RESPONSE AND I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE PUTTING MY LIFE IN DANGER WITH THIS PROBLEM DUE TO THE FACT THAT I HAVE TO DRIVE MY CAR TO WORK AND BACK AFTER GETTING CONFIRMATION THAT A FIRE CAN START IN THE ENGINE BAY DUE TO THIS PROBLEM. AFTER GETTING REFUSED BY THE DEALERSHIP I HAD TO TAKE IT TO A LOCAL MECHANIC TO MY KNOWLEDGE COULD NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CARS. I WOULD RATHER TAKE IT TO A PROFESSIONAL AT SUBARU WHICH THEY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR FIXING THIS ISSUE AND KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING.",
