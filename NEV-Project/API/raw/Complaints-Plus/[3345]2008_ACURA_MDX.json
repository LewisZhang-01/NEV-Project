BATTERY WAS REPLACED. VARIOUS INTERNAL COMPONENTS OF THE CAR STARTED TO FALL APART (SEAT BELTS, AIRBAGS, CAR LIGHTS, CAR KEY, WINDOW SENSORS, DOOR LOCKS, ALARM, NAVIGATION).

THEN HERE WE GO AGAIN, I AM ON THE FREEWAY WITH A BRAND NEW BATTERY INSTALLED BY ACURA WHEN EVERYTHING POWERS OFF YET AGAIN. CAR EVEN BRAKED ITSELF AND I SAW MY LIFE FLASH BEFORE MY EYES. I WAS ON THE FREEWAY GOING ABOUT 70 MPH WHEN THIS OCCURRED AND TRAFFIC FLOW WAS THICK. I TOOK MY CAR TO ACURA AND CURRENTLY THEY HAVE HAD IT FOR OVER A WEEK. THEY TELL ME IT IS MY BATTERY AGAIN WHICH THEY WILL REPLACE FOR FREE BUT THEY WANT TO KEEP FOR FURTHER TESTING. I WORK FROM HOME AND DRIVE MY CAR EXTENDED DISTANCES WHEN NEEDED AND I NEED RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION. THIS CAR IS PROVING UNRELIABLE. I AM NOT GETTING STRAIGHT ANSWERS FROM ANYONE AND IN 4 YEARS I HAVE REPLACED MY BATTERY 3 TIMES! I PARK IN THE GARAGE! THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN.

THE SERVICE ADVISOR AGREES THE ISSUE IS DEFINITELY THE HFL UNIT AND THE HFL UNIT WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED OR UNPLUGGED BUT HE WILL HAVE THE TECHNICIAN DIAGNOSE TO CONFIRM .

THE PROBLEM IS IN THE DESIGN OF THE ADS SYSTEM FOR THE MDX'S WAS POOR AND IT ALLOWED SALT AND MOISTURE INTO THE SENSOR CONTROL FOR THE STRUT THUS CAUSING CORROSION IN THE SENSOR AND STRUT.  EVENTUALLY THE STRUT FAILS.   WHEN WE CALLED ACURA AND I SPOKE WITH FRANK SWARTWOT IN ACURA CUSTOMER SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA, HE TOLD US THAT OUR VIN WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SERVICE REQUEST.  WE EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT WE LIVE IN SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH AND WE GET A LOT OF SNOW AND SALT IS USED ON THE ROADS WHEN THERE IS A SNOW STORM.  (WE DID HOST THE 2002 OLYMPIC GAMES AFTER ALL.)  WE ALSO TOLD HIM THAT THE ADS FAILURE LIGHT CAME ON IN JANUARY 2013 IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORST SNOW STORM OF THE YEAR. THIS SOUNDED LIKE THE PERFECT COMBINATION TO CAUSE THESE PROBLEMS.  ACURA TOLD US THEY WOULD NOT COVER US AND BASICALLY TOLD US THEY COULD COVER IT IF WE WERE VALUED CUSTOMERS.  SINCE WE HAD PURCHASED THE MDX USED AND DID NOT GO TO JODY WILKINSON FOR OUR REPAIRS, THEY WOULD NOT COVER IT.    WE ENDED UP REPLACING THE RIGHT FRONT STRUT AND THE SENSOR AND WHEN THE MECHANIC LOOKED AT THE SENSOR AND THE STRUT, IT WAS FULLY RUSTED AND CORRODED..  WE FULLY EXPECT THE OTHER SENSOR AND STRUT TO FAIL WITHIN THE YEAR AS THAT IS WHAT HAPPENS ACCORDING TO THE ACURA MECHANIC.  THE COST TO REPLACE EACH STRUT THROUGH THE ACURA DEALERSHIP IS $1250.    ACURA HAS SINCE REPLACED THE OLD SENSOR AND STRUTS USED ON THEIR CARS WITH A NEW DESIGN.  WE FEEL THAT IF ACURA HAD AT LEAST WARNED US THAT THIS COULD BE AN ISSUE, WE COULD HAVE REPLACED THE SENSOR (A $200 FIX) AND SAVED THE STRUT.

THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE I GOT THE CAR 2 YEARS AGO.  I HAVE RECENTLY BEEN TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THERE ARE MANY OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SAME PROBLEM AND IT IS A DESIGN FLAW THAT HAS BEEN CORRECTED IN NEWER MODELS.  AT PRESENT THE ONLY SOLUTION IS DRIVE SLOWER THRU PUDDLES SO THE CABLES THAT ARE EXPOSED UNDER THE CAR DO NOT GET WET AND THEREFORE THE POWER STEERING IS MOMENTARILY LOST.  I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A TURN THE LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED, AND IT WAS QUITE FRIGHTENING SINCE BASICALLY ONE IS LOSING STEERING CONTROL OF THE CAR.  MY 9 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS IN THE BACK SEAT.  THERE IS NO WARNING WHEN THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND ONE DOES NOT ALWAYS KNOW WHEN THE CAR HAS GONE THRU A PUDDLE.  FURTHERMORE, WATCHING FOR PUDDLES IS A DANGEROUS DISTRACTION IN A RAIN STORM.  I CALLED ACURA TODAY AS I LOST BATTERY POWER YESTERDAY AND HAD TO CALL ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND I SUSPECT THIS IS RELATED TO THE PROBLEM I HAD THE WEEK BEFORE.  THEY DENY ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE SITUATION EVEN THOUGH I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP, MIAMI ACURA, THAT THEY HAD NOTIFIED ACURA AND THAT ACURA FIXED THE PROBLEM IN NEWER MODELS BUT HAD NO SOLUTION FOR THOSE WHO WERE DRIVING THESE MODELS.  I ASKED THEM IF THEY WERE, LIKE TOYOTA, GOING TO WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE DIED BEFORE THEY WOULD ISSUE A RECALL.  I HOPE NHTSA WILL TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AND PURSUE AN INVESTIGATION IMMEDIATELY. *TR",

I WENT TO SEE ABOUT PURCHASING A NEW VEHICLE BUT FOUND WITH THE NEW HEAD RESTRAINT I CAN NOT SEE OUT THE WINDSHIELD OF THE VEHICLE, I CAN SEE THE HOOD  BUT THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE HEAD RESTRAINT PREVENTS MY HEAD FROM MOVING TO A POSITION TO SEE OUT THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE.  THE ONLY I COULD SEE OUT THE WINDSHIELD WITH THE SEAT POSITIONED WHERE I WANT IT WAS TO REMOVE THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE DESIGNED HEAD RESTRAINT, THIS IS A SAFETY PROBLEM CREATED BY THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE.  I THINK THE RESEARCH THEY DID IS FLAWED BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME PEOPLE ARE HIT IN THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE IS WHEN THEY ARE STOPPED AND WHAT I SEE WHEN PEOPLE ARE STOPPED IS THEY ARE LEANING OVER PLAYING WITH THE RADIO OR CELL PHONE, IN A POSITION WHERE THEIR HEAD IS NO WHERE NEAR THE HEAD RESTRAINT.  CONTRARY TO WHAT THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE FOR SAFETY THINKS PEOPLE DO NOT SIT-UP STRAIGHT WHEN THEY ARE DRIVING.  EITHER I WILL KEEP MY OLD CARS TILL I DIE, NOT HELPING THE ECONOMY, OR DRIVE A NEW ONE WITH THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE FOR SAFETY HEAD RESTRAINTS REMOVED AND LET THE AMBULANCE CHASER HANDLE IT IF I GET REAR ENDED.  MAY BE THEY CAN CO AFTER THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE FOR THEIR GREAT DESIGN.  *TR",

AFTER LOADING CARGO SPACE I WANTED TO CLOSE TAILGATE MANUALLY VERY SLOWLY TO ENSURE THAT CARGO WOULD NOT DAMAGE DOOR, OR DOOR DAMAGE CARGO. I GRASPED THE TAILGATE  DOOR ON LOWER EDGE AND BEGAN SLOWLY CLOSING TAILGATE DOOR TO MAKE SURE DOOR WOULD CLEAR ANY POSSIBLE OBSTRUCTIONS BEFORE ACTUALLY CLOSING DOOR SECURELY.    WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS DESIGN IS AS YOU GET CLOSE TO THE POINT WHERE THE DOOR IS ALMOST ALL THE WAY DOWN, AN AUTOMATIC SENSOR IS TRIPPED AND BEGINS TO AUTOMATICALLY CLOSE THE DOOR TO IT FULLY CLOSED POSITION.     I WAS NOT AWARE OF THIS AND AS A RESULT THE DOOR CRUSHED BY FINGERS.    THERE ARE NO PERMANENT DAMAGES. JUST A VERY PAINFUL EXPERIENCE.  *TR",
