ISSUES WITH THE BRAKES STARTED WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF OWNERSHIP AND HAVE STEADILY WORSENED SINCE.  THE COMPLAINT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO VARIOUS DEALERS AT LEAST TEN TIMES WITH NO TROUBLE FOUND.      ONE FAILURE MODE I HAVE OBSERVED RESULTED IN THREE VERY CLOSE CALLS WHERE THE BRAKE PEDAL IS FIRM, BUT THE VEHICLE DOES NOT SLOW.  PRESSING THE BRAKE HARDER DOES NOT INCREASE BRAKING EFFECTIVENESS.  IN ONE INSTANCE, I WAS FORCED TO DRIVE OFF THE ROAD TO AVOID (KILLING) A PEDESTRIAN.      A SECOND FAILURE MODE IS THE OPPOSITE; A SLIGHT AMOUNT OF PRESSURE APPLIED TO THE BRAKE PEDAL RESULTS IN THE FRONT BRAKES LOCKING.    A THIRD FAILURE MODE IS WHERE BRAKING RESULTS IN A VIOLENT SHIMMY, WHICH CAUSED ME TO LOSE CONTROL ON SNOWPACK AND SLIDE OFF THE ROAD.    NONE OF THESE FAILURE MODES HAS BEEN CONSISTENT, NOR HAVE THEY REPEATED AT THE DEALERSHIP.  I AM VERY CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY AND THAT OF THOSE AROUND ME.

ON DECEMBER 2, 2003, JOE TAYLOR FORD IN SENECA, PA , \"VERIFIED CONCERN FOUND REAR WHEEL CYLINDERS FROZE, SPRINGS RUSTED, DRUMS WARPED AND ADJUSTERS FROZEN REPLACED ALL COMPONENTS.\"  IN ADDITION THERE WAS BRAKE SHOE FAILURE.  STAFF AT THE DEALERSHIP NOTED THIS WAS TYPICAL OF 2002 RANGERS AND STATED WE WERE IN SERIOUS DANGER IN DRIVING THE TRUCK.  \"THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD AND ONE THAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING FREQUENTLY IN RANGERS AND F-150'S.\"  (PER STAFF)  IN ADDITION IT RELATES TO NHTSA ITEM 620159 AND 10002516.  THE PREMATURE FAILURE OF THE DRIVE SHAFTS (WHICH I HAVE HAD REPLACED FOR LOUD NOISES, IS PROBABLY BEING CAUSED BY REAR BRAKES THAT ARE CONSTANTLY ON.    I HAVE ALSO HAD THIS TRUCK BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP THREE TIMES FOR A SLIPPING TRANSMISSION.  THE RANGER BRAKE LINING WAS INSPECTED AND IT CAME OFF IN CHUNKS AND THE DRUMS WERE WARPED DUE TO HEAT.     THIS RANGER IS UNDER ITS ORIGINAL 36,000 MILE GUARANTEE AND I STILL HAD TO PAY FOR PART OF THE REPAIRS.  THIS TRUCK HAS A BRAKE SAFETY PROBLEM.  OUR TRUCK HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE WATER AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN GARAGE KEPT.  BRAKE CYLINDERS AND ADJUSTERS DO NOT FREEZE IN 19,000 MILES UNLESS THERE IS A SERIOUS QUALITY PROBLEM.  WE HAVE DEALER DOCUMENTATION TO SHOW WHAT WORK WAS PERFORMED AND THE $58.30 PAID FOR BRAKE SHOES ON THIS ONE YEAR OLD TRUCK.  WE TRIED TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE WITH THREE MANAGERS AND THEY ALL SAID THAT IS THE WAY IT IS.  I AM VERY CONCERNED FOR THE SAFETY OF OTHERS WITH DRIVE SHAFT PROBLEMS.  PLEASE HAVE THEIR REAR BRAKES INSPECTED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  THANK YOU.    *CB",

FORTUNATELY, MY DAUGHTER HAD ONLY MILD INJURIES AND WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE E.R. VIA AMBULANCE. IN ADDITION, THERE WERE NO OTHER VEHICLES INVOLVED WITH THE TRUCK OR THE FLYING WHEEL. WHEN I SAW THE CAR AT THE WRECKER YARD, I NOTED THE WHOLE WHEEL AND PART OF THE AXLE WERE MISSING. MY DAUGHTER'S BOYFRIEND FOUND THE TIRE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH THE AXLE AND PART OF THE BRAKE COMPONENTS STILL ATTACHED. HAS THERE BEEN ANY OTHER REPORTS OF A WHEEL BREAKING OFF OF A FORD RANGER? IN RETROSPECT, THIS TRUCK HAS ONLY 6000 MILES AND THERE HAS BEEN TWO BLOWN OUTS ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE REAR TIRE IN WHICH I HAD TO REPLACE THE TIRE WITHIN THE PAST TWO MONTHS.  THE TIRES ARE GOODYEAR.  COULD THIS BE RELATED AS WELL OR IS IT A DIFFERENCE PROBLEM?  *LA",

HAD TO HAVE A TIRE REPLACED WITH 1066 MILES ON THE VEHICLE BECAUSE SOME OF THE TREAD WAS BEGINNING TO COME OFF, VEHICLE WAS REALIGNED AT THE SAME TIME TO CURE A PULL TO THE RIGHT WHICH DID NOTHING STILL PULLS TO THE RIGHT. I HAVE TRIED TO GET IN CONTACT OF FORD MOTOR COMPANY TO GET THIS VEHICLE REPLACED UNDER A LEMON LAW TO NO AVAIL. I GET TOLD A STORY AND PUT OFF, THE DEALERSHIP I BOUGHT THIS THING FROM DOES THE SAME THING TRIES TO FIX IT TO NO AVAIL AND PUTS ME OFF. I PAID 15 THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THIS TRUCK AND NOW MAY LOSE MY JOB BECAUSE IT IS NOT DEPENDABLE! SOMETHING MUST BE DONE THIS IS NOT HOW TO TREAT A REPEAT CUSTOMER, THIS BEING MY 4TH FORD PRODUCT AND MY LAST.   *NLM",

SECOND FAILURE WAS ON 07/09/02 WITH APPROX. 3650 MILES, VEHICLE AGAIN WAS MAKING A TURN AT APPROX. 15 MPH. THIS FAILURE OCCURRED THE EVENING OF PICKING UP THE VEHICLE FROM JEROME DUNCAN FORD FOR SERVICE. HOWEVER, JEROME DUNCAN REFUSED TO ITEMIZE THIS PROBLEM ON THEIR REPAIR LIST BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WAS CURRENTLY RUNNING AND DID NOT STALL OUT IN THEIR POSSESSION. THIRD FAILURE OCCURED 08/11/02 WITH APPROX. 5700 MILES, VEHICLE WAS TRAVELING AT APPROX. 25-30 MPH ATTEMPTING TO TURN OR CURVE TO THE LEFT. EACH TIME THIS \"STALL OUT\" HAS OCCURRED THE ENGINE HAS BEEN WARM AND THE GAS TANK HAD 1/4 OR MORE OF GAS IN IT.  I PREVENTED THE FOURTH OCCURRENCE FROM HAPPENING WHEN STOPPED AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT AND GIVING THE ENGINE SOME GAS WHILE KEEPING ONE FOOT ON THE BRAKE. I HAVE TAKEN THIS VEHICLE IN FOR SERVICING FOR THIS PROBLEM 3 TIMES, HOWEVER, 2 OF THE TIMES JEROME DUNCAN FORD HAS REFUSED TO DOCUMENT IT, SAYING THE VEHICLE IS RUNNING AND APPEARS TO BE IN WORKING ORDER. ONLY ONCE HAS THIS VEHICLE BEEN DOCUMENTED WITH A FORD DEALER FOR ISSUES, RUSS MILNE FORD 24777 HALL RD. MACOMB MI 48042 (810) 948-7700. THE TECHNICIANS THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE FOR THE STALL OUTS. I WILL ONCE AGAIN TAKE MY VEHICLE IN AND HAVE THIS PROBLEM DOCUMENTED TO ENSURE MY CASE UNDER THE MICHIGAN LEMON LAW. BECAUSE THE VEHICLE \"STALLS OUT\" ALL POWER IS LOST, ENABLING ME TO STEER PROPERLY AND POSSIBLY ENDANGERING MYSELF AND OTHERS. ON THE SECOND OCCURRENCE I NARROWLY MISSED A HEAD ON COLLISION. I WOULD LIKE THIS MATTER INVESTIGATED AND WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU.*AK",

THE OTHER VEHICLE SPED UP; I SLOWED; HE SLOWED; OBVIOUSLY A GAME OF SOME KIND WAS BEING PLAYED THAT I WANTED NO PART OF, SO I TRIED TO GET AWAY AND WHEN I HIT 85MPH, MY VEHICLE CEASED TO ACCELERATE AND BEGAN ACTING LIKE IT WAS STARVED FOR GAS. I SPOKE TO MY DEALER AND FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND LEARNED THAT THE VEHICLE HAS A \"REV LIMITER\" WHICH IS APPARENTLY A GOVERNOR THAT STOPS ALL ACCELERATION AT 85MPH.  AS FAR AS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE, FORD IS THE ONLY VEHICLE MADE THAT HAS SUCH A LIMITER AND IT CANNOT BE REMOVED OR ALTERED. WHEN I ASKED FORD WHY, I WAS TOLD IT WAS FOR MY OWN GOOD SINCE SPEED LIMITS ARE MAXIMUM OF 70-75 MPH ACROSS AMERICA . I THEN ASKED WHY THE SPEEDOMETER WENT TO 120 MPH AND THEY SAID THE VEHICLE WAS DESIGNED FOR IT BUT FORD CHOSE TO NOT LET DRIVERS EXCEED 85. I ASKED WHY FORD FELT COMPELLED TO HOLD A DRIVER TO 85 WHEN EVERY OTHER MANUFACTURER DID NOT AND HOW SAFE WAS IT TO ALLOW ME TO GO ONLY 10MPH OVER THE MAXIMUM SPEED WHEN THAT ALSO MEANT I COULD GO 55MPH OVER IN AN AREA POSTED FOR 30MPH. SAME ANSWER--FOR MY OWN GOOD. ONE OF THE MANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS IS THAT IN RARE EMERGENCY OCCASIONS (SUCH AS PASSING AN 18 WHEELER AND SOMEONE AHEAD PULLING OUT FROM A SIDE ROAD COMING IN MY DIRECTION--THERE ARE PROBABLY BETTER EXAMPLES), I MAY BE PAST THE POINT OF BEING ABLE TO SLOW DOWN OR ANOTHER CAR MAY BE BEHIND ME, AND WE ALL GET KILLED BECAUSE FORD DECIDED THEIR CARS SHOULD GO SLOWER THAN EVERY COMPARABLE VEHICLE ON THE ROAD. I COULD UNDERSTAND ALL CARS TOPPING OFF AT 85, BUT NOT ONLY ONE--AND NOT ONE THAT HAS EVERY INDICATION IT WOULD GO FASTER IN AN EMERGENCY AND FORD NEVER TELLING YOU ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY UNTIL THE EMERGENCY OCCURS.

        "summary": "I RECENTLY PURCHASED A 2002 FORD RANGER.  ON MARCH 11, THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT STOP AS I WAS TURNING AROUND NEAR THE NEW PHILADELPHIA POST OFFICE AROUND MY LUNCHTIME.  I HAD MY FOOT TO THE FLOOR AND THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT STOP.  I ENDED UP HITTING THE CONCRETE RAMP AT THE TUSCARAWAS COUNTY EDUCATIONAL BUILDING.  THE TIRES CONTINUED TO SPIN EVEN THOUGH MY FOOT WAS TO THE FLOOR AND I WAS HITTING THE CONCRETE BARRIER!  THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAD EXPERIENCED THIS HOWEVER THE FIRST TIME I DID NOT HIT ANYTHING I JUST JUMPED THE CURB AT MY APARTMENT.  I THOUGHT THE FIRST TIME WAS MY ERROR BECAUSE I HADN'T BEEN USED TO DRIVING A TRUCK.  ALSO, AFTER THE FIRST TIME I WASHED MY TRUCK I NOTICED PAINT CHIPPING OFF OF THE FLARE... ONLY THE CLEAR COAT IS CHIPPING...  I HAVE TAKEN THE TRUCK TO FORD (HUMPHRIES) AND THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS BUT WERE UNABLE TO REPAIR THE DENTED BUMPER BECAUSE FORD ADVISED THEM THERE WERE NO RECALLS.  FORD HAS ALSO SENT ME A LETTER STATING IT IS AN INSURANCE MATTER.  MY GOAL IS THIS: I DO NOT FEEL I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING TO GET THE PROBLEMS FIXED.  I WANT THE DENTED BUMPER REPAIRED AND THE CHIPS IN THE FLARE REPAIRED.  I DO NOT HAVE $500 TO WAIT TO BE REIMBURSED ON EITHER.  WHAT CAN BE DONE TO HELP ME?   NLM",

REQUESTED FAILURE ANALYSIS OF FAILED PART TO DETERMINE ROOT CAUSE OF FAILURE, INFORMED THAT DEALERSHIPS DO NOT HAVE PERSONNEL TRAINED TO DO THIS. INFORMED DEALERSHIPS THAT I DO NOT FEEL VEHICLE IS SAFE AND WOULD LIKE THEM TO TAKE THE VEHICLE BACK DUE TO IT ONLY BEING 35 DAYS OLD AND 1700 MILES, TOLD THEM THAT I WOULD CONSIDER THE PURCHASE OF A DIFFERENT FORD VEHICLE. WAS INFORMED THAT FORD DOES NOT HAVE A BUY BACK PROGRAM AND ANY NEGOTIATION WOULD HAVE TO BE DONT WITH REGIONAL FORD REP. WAITED UNTIL 12/11 TO HER FROM REP AND SHE WAS IN A MEETING AND TOLD ME SHE WOULD CALL ME BACK.

CONTINUED TO CALL CUSTOMER RELATIONS LINE AND DEALERSHIP AND STILL DID NOT HEAR ANYTHING ON MY CONCERN. FINALLY HEARD FROM FORD REP ON 12/15 AND WAS OFFERED AND ESP 5 YRS 75K MILES, INFORMED REP THIS WAS UNACCEPTABLE DUE TO THE LENGTH OF MY TIME THAT WAS WASTED ON THIS ISSUE. REP INFORMED ME THAT THERE IS NOT A PROBLEM WITH THE FUEL LINE ON THE RANGER, I INFORMED REP THAT THERE ARE OTHER DOCUMENTED CASES OF THIS ON THE NHTSA WEB SITE. FORD REP BECAME DEFENSIVE AND ENDED UP HANGING UP ON ME. WHILE WAITING TO HEAR FROM THIS REP I REQUESTED A DSB APPLICATION AND IT TOOK THREE REQUESTS TO FINALLY GET ONE, THIS TOOK FROM 12/21 UNTIL 01/16 TO RECIEVE, NEVER RECIEVED A PHONE CALL FROM DEALERSHIP AFTER REQUESTING DSB APP AS INFORMED BY CUSTOMER LINE THAT I WOULD.
