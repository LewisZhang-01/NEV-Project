HONDA ISSUED A VOLUNTARY RECALL FOR 2002 CIVICS, WHICH DOES NOT DESCRIBE MY PROBLEM. HOWEVER, MY NEIGHBOR RECEIVED NHTSA RECALL 12V-136, WHICH DOES DESCRIBE MY PROBLEM. IT STATES, \"THERE IS A POTENTIAL FAILURE WITH THE WIRING OF THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS WHICH MAY CAUSE THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS TO FAIL...THE DEALER WILL REPLACE THE LOW BEAM TERMINAL AND IF NECESSARY THE COMBINATION LIGHTING SWITCH.\"     IN THE VOLUNTARY RECALL, HONDA WILL ONLY REPLACE THE COMBINATION LIGHTING SWITCH.  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE NHTSA FEELS THAT HONDA SHOULD REPLACE THE LOW BEAM TERMINAL IN THE CR-V MODELS, BUT FOR THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM IN OTHER MODELS, HONDA DOES NOT FEEL THEY SHOULD REPLACE THE LOW BEAM TERMINAL.      I BROUGHT MY CIVIC IN FOR THE VOLUNTARY RECALL. MY DRIVER SIDE LOW BEAM HAD ALREADY FAILED (JUST SHY OF TWO MONTHS OLD. THE PASSENGER SIDE IS LIKELY TO FAIL SOON.) AFTER THE WORK WAS COMPLETE, MY LOW BEAM STILL WAS NOT FUNCTIONAL. THE TECHNICIAN EXPLAINED THAT THE RECALL DOES NOT AUTHORIZE HIM TO REPLACE MY LIGHTBULB FREE-OF-CHARGE.      WHEN I CALLED AMERICA HONDA, I ASKED ABOUT RECEIVING A REPLACEMENT LIGHTBULB.  THE REPRESENTATIVE SAID THAT THE PROBLEM I WAS EXPERIENCING WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE RECALL COVERED. LATER, HE SAID THAT IF THE WORDING USED IN NHTSA'S RECALL 12V-136 WAS USED, I WOULDN'T EVEN BE ON THE PHONE WITH HIM.  HOWEVER, HE EXPLAINED THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR DIAGNOSIS SERVICES, AND IF THE LOW BEAM TERMINAL IS THE CAUSE, I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT MYSELF.  *TR",

HOWEVER, ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION, I KEPT ACCELERATING THE CAR UP THE INCLINE, BUT AT 60MPH THE CAR'S RPMS WERE INCREASING TO THE RED LINE ZONE MEANING THE CAR WAS NOT SHIFTING. SINCE MY CAR HAD NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE, I WAS CONFUSED AND ALSO I WAS CONCERNED THE RPMS WOULD INCREASE TOO MUCH SO I ATTEMPTED TO APPLY THE BRAKES TO SLOW THE SPEED OF THE CAR. THE BRAKES FELT AS IF THEY HAD LOCKED UP, WOULD NOT PRESS DOWN, AND BARELY SLOWED THE CAR TO 55MPH. I TOOK MY FOOT OFF OF THE BRAKE PEDAL AND WITHOUT MY FOOT PRESSING DOWN ON THE ACCELERATOR OR THE BRAKE PEDAL, THE CAR QUICKLY ACCELERATED ON IT'S OWN TO 70MPH AND THE RPMS WERE RED LINING. I QUICKLY APPLIED THE BRAKES AGAIN, WHICH WERE DOING LITTLE TO SLOW MY CAR. THE BRAKES WERE COMPETING WITH THE ACCELERATION AND MYSELF AND MY TWO PASSENGERS COULD SMELL THE BRAKES BURNING. I CHECKED THAT THE FLOOR MAT WAS OUT OF THE WAY AND IT WAS. I CHECKED THAT CRUISE CONTROL WASN'T TURNED ON AND IT WASN'T. I APPLIED THE BRAKES AS HARD AS I COULD AND WAS ABLE TO DECELERATE THE CAR TO 40MPH WITH THE RPMS STILL RED LINING. THEN I SHIFTED THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL, AND ALTHOUGH THE CARS RPMS WERE OUT OF CONTROL, THE SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL DECELERATED THE CAR TO ABOUT 10 MPH. I PULLED THE E-BRAKE AND SHUT OFF THE ENGINE. AT THIS TIME THE BRAKES WERE VISIBLY SMOKING. I CONTACTED THE HONDA DEALERSHIP WHO WAS INCREDIBLY RELUCTANT TO HELP. IN A MEETING WITH THE MANAGER, HE EVEN STATED, \"HOW DO WE KNOW YOUR FOOT WASN'T ON THE ACCELERATOR THE WHOLE TIME?\" I INSPECTED THE AIR CLEANER BOX COVER MYSELF AND SAW NO DAMAGE (DUE TO A RECALL I READ ABOUT ON THAT MAKE/MODEL). HONDA FOUND NOTHING WRONG, SAID THE CAR WAS \"OPERATING AS DESIGNED\" AND SENT ME HOME WITH A BILL.",

I JUST PURCHASED A USED 2002 HONDA CIVIC WITH JUST OVER 43,000 MILES. I DID NOTICE WHEN SHIFTING GEARS, THERE WAS A TINNY, BUZZING SOUND. I REPORTED IT TO THE DEALERSHIP (PURCHASED FROM A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP), AND SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT WITH THEM TO LOOK AT IT. DAYS BEFORE THAT APPOINTMENT, I WAS HEADING UP A STEEP AND NARROW GRAVEL ROAD TO WORK, AND THE GEARS STOPPED ENGAGING ALTOGETHER. I HAD TO PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND BACK DOWN THE HILL, HOPEFUL THAT A CAR WOULD NOT COME AROUND THE BLIND CORNER I WAS BACKING TOWARD. I HAD TO CALL MY BOSS TO COME AND RESCUE ME, AND A TOW TRUCK TO TAKE THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP. IN THE RESEARCH I'VE DONE SINCE, IT APPEARS HONDA WILL NOT ISSUE A RECALL BECAUSE IT'S NOT A \"SAFETY\" CONCERN. AND PERHAPS THE MANY OTHERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS SAME ISSUE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE, BUT I'D SAY IT'S A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THIS HAPPENS TO SOMEONE ON A BUSY HIGHWAY, AND THEY'RE NOT SO FORTUNATE.

THEY SAID IF IT WAS MY SEAT BELT THEY WOULD HELP ME, BUT THEY DO NOT FEEL AIR BAGS ARE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO FIX. THEY ALSO SAID THEY DON'T REALLY SAVE LIVES.

THE EMT'S, MEDICAL PERSONNEL IN THE ER, AND DOCTORS AT THE  BURN UNIT SAID THE BURNS WERE CAUSED BY CHEMICALS EMITTED FROM THE AIRBAGS.

I MUST PROTECT MY HANDS FROM THE SUN FOR AT LEAST A FULL YEAR AFTER THE ACCIDENT AND HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO SCRATCH MY HANDS AS THE SKIN IS STILL DELICATE.  THE HONDA OWNERS MANUAL AND AIRBAG BOOKLET FOR THE CAR BOTH SAY THAT THE POWDER THAT COMES OUT OF THE AIRBAG IS HARMLESS UNLESS YOU ALREADY HAVE RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS AND BREATH IN THE POWDER.  THEY SAY ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT THE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH CHEMICAL BURNS RESULTING FROM THIS POWDER, EVEN THOUGH, AS THE EMT'S AND DOCTORS INFORMED ME, THEY COMMONLY TREAT THESE BURNS.

IN THESE FORUMS MANY DRIVERS HAVE EXPERIENCED LOSS OF ENGINE FAILERE AND BRAKES IN SOME CASES. HONDA JUST PUT OUT A RECALL ON 1998-2000 FOR THE ENGINE IGNITION SWITCH SHORTING OUT CAUSING ENGINE FAILERE. I SUGGEST THEY INCREASE THAT RECALL TO 2002 POSSIBLY. ALSO I READ WHERE THE ELECTRICAL LOAD DETECTOR IS GETTING WET AND SHORTING OUT CAUSING THE SAME THING IN SOME CARS. IN ONE CASE I READ THAT THE VACUMM HOSE TO THE BRAKE BOOSTER MAY BE BAD.

I ASKED HIM IF I COULD DROP IT OFF AND THEY COULD TAKE IT FOR A TEST DRIVE TO SEE IF IT COMES BACK ON SO THEY CAN GET THE CODE OUT OF IT AND HE TOLD ME TO DRIVE IT AROUND AND I TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE I HAVE TO WORK, SO AGAIN I AM DRIVING WITH PARTIAL BRAKES. *JB",

I TOOK THE CAR IN, AND AGAIN, THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. I FINALLY INSISTED THE DEALERSHIP KEEP THE CAR FOR A FEW DAYS AND DRIVE IT. AS THEY WERE DRIVING IT OUT OF THEIR GARAGE, THE BRAKES TOTALLY FAILED. THEY REPLACED THE MASTER CYLINDER 2 TIMES.  THE BRAKES STILL GRABBED, SO HARD IN FACT, THAT BOTH MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE HAD DRINKS IN OUR HANDS WHILE DRIVING AND THE DRINKS SPILLED ON US.  THE DEALERSHIP DECIDED THE GRABBING WAS AN ERRATIC DOWNSHIFT OF THE TRANSMISSION.  HONDA SAID AND I QUOTE: THIS IS A NORMAL PROBLEM WITH THE HONDA 2002 CIVICS.  THE DEALERSHIP WOULD NOT FIX THE CAR SINCE IT WAS A NORMAL PROBLEM. I STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT A NORMAL PROBLEM IS!   DURING THIS TIME,  I BEGAN PURSING THE OKLAHOMA LEMON LAW.  I TRIED TO HAVE THE DEALERSHIP BUY MY CAR BACK AND THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T BECAUSE IT HAD SO MANY PROBLEMS AND THEY COULDN'T SELL IT AS A CERTIFIED USED HONDA. SO, I HAVE A NEW CAR THAT WAS A LEMON FROM THE DAY I BOUGHT IT AND THE DEALERSHIP NOR HONDA WILL BUY IT BACK!!!!!!!! HONDA DID GIVE ME THEIR 100,000 MILE WARRANTY FOR FREE.  TODAY, I TOOK THE CAR BACK IN TO THE DEALERSHIP AS THE BRAKES ARE GRABBING HARDER. TONDA L. AMES, APR   BARTLESVILLE PUBLIC SCHOOLS   COMMUNITY RELATIONS SUPERVISOR   1100 S.

THEY JUST IGNORED AND SAID ALL WAS FINE. (1) WEEK LATER I AM ONCE AGAIN AT THE DEALER BECAUSE IT IS STILL BLOWING HOT AIR. DEALER SAID THAT THE AC UNIT WAS NOT INSTALLED IN CIVICS AT FACTORY YET THEY WERE INSTALLED LATER AND ARE OBVIOUSLY CHEAPER AND THEY DON'T WORK VERY WELL. I ASKED HIM WHY THEY DON'T TELL PEOPLE THIS. HE STATED THEY DO-WHICH WE THE BUYERS KNOW THAT THEY WOULD NEVER TELL US THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE THERE TO,SELL CARS. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WILL TELL ME THIS TIME BUT IF IT IS STILL BLOWING HOT AIR ON AND OFF I AM GOING BACK TO THE DEALER AND ASK FOR MY MONEY BACK AND WILL TAKE AN ATTORNEY. THEY SHOULD NOT PUT IN CHEAP ITEMS AND RIP OFF PEOPLE. I LIVE IN AZ WHERE IT IS 116+ DEGREES. I DROVE THE ACCORD AND HAD NO PROBLEM AND THE DELALER STATED THEY HAD A BETTER AC IN THEM FROM FACTORY. I BELIEVE THAT I AM ENTITLED TO A UPGRADE CAR THAT WORKS AT NO ADDITIONAL COST. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO SIT AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT AND SWEAT OR TURN THE CORNER AND HAVE HOT AIR BLAST AT THEM. I WAS TOLD ALSO THAT THEY HAVE HAD MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE AC BUT OBVIOUSLY HAVE DONE NOTHING. I TOLD THEM I WAS GOING TO COMPLAIN TO CONSUMER AFFAIRS ETC AND WAS TOLD THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA.

ONE ONGOING PROBLEM IS A VIBRATION AT 55 MPH IN THE STEERING WHEEL, WHICH HONDA HAS ATTRIBUTED TO A WHEEL BALANCE PROBLEM AND TIRE PROBLEM. THE CAR HAS BEEN SERVICED 14 TIMES BY HONDA AND FIRESTONE (TIRE MANUFACTURER) AND MERCHANT TIRE (BALANCE). HONDA TRIED TO BALANCE THE WHEELS AND AFTER SEVERAL FAILED ATTEMPTS TOLD ME IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH FAULTY TIRES (OEM). HONDA TOLD ME THEY COULD DO NOTHING FURTHER ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND TOLD ME I HAD TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM ON MY OWN WITH THE TIRE MANUFACTURER DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE CAR WAS OBVIOUSLY STILL UNDER HONDA WARRANTY. NONE OF THE BALANCING SOLVED THE PROBLEM AND HONDA TOLD ME IT MUST BE DEFECTIVE (ORIGINAL) TIRES. FIRESTONE THEM REPLACED 3 TIRES UNDER WARRANTY AND THE PROBLEM STILL PERSISTED. THEY ATTEMPTED TO BALANCE THE WHEELS 2 MORE TIMES. I WENT BACK TO HONDA AND THEY BALANCED THE WHEELS AGAIN WITH NO SUCCESS AND THEY WOULD NOT INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM FURTHER.  THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER PROBLEMS.  ONE IS A PROBLEM WITH HISSING AND STATIC IN THE RADIO RECEPTION WHEN THE REAR WINDOW DEFOGGER IS ON (SINCE NEW). HONDA REPLACED THE RADIO AND DEFOGGER SWITCH BUT THE PROBLEM IS STILL THERE. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS A VISIBILITY PROBLEM IN THE REAR WINDOW (SINCE NEW). A HAZY STICKY FILM DEVELOPS ON THE REAR WINDOW. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO CLEAN WITH HOUSEHOLD GLASS CLEANER. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT THE ORIGINAL HONDA FLOOR MAT WORE RIGHT THROUGH WHEN THE CAR WAS NOT EVEN A YEAR OLD. I HAD TO PURCHASE A WHOLE SET FOR ABOUT $90.  THE DRIVERS SEAT UPHOLSTERY ALSO BEGAN TO WEAR PREMATURELY.  ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST YEAR IS A DAMP MOLDY MUSTY ODOR COMING FROM THE AIR CONDITIONER/HEATER VENTS. THE ODOR IS SOMETIMES STRONG AND WHEN I TURN ON THE AC OR HEATER IT MAKES ME COUGH AND FEEL ILL. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY OF THIS VEHICLE.",

I HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME GOING ABOUT 40MPH.  I DO NOT THINK THAT MY SEATBELT LOCKED.  MY AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY BUT MY PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG DID.  I HIT THE STEERING WHEEL VERY HARD!  I HAD TO BE TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL.  I HAVE SEVERE CHEST CONTUSIONS AND NECK AND BACK SPRAIN/STRAIN.  MY INSURANCE CO BELIEVES MY CAR MAY BE A TOTAL LOSS BUT MY AIRBAG DID NOT GO OFF???  AND BECAUSE IT DID NOT GO OFF, I WAS INJURED.  HONDA WAS CONTACTED THE NEXT DAY.  NINE DAYS LATER, THEY SENT AN ADJUSTER OUT TO INSPECT MY CAR (BUT NOT AN ENGINEER).  I HAVE BEEN TOLD THERE IS NO REASON TO SEND AN ENGINEER OUT  THE ADJUSTER SEEMED TO BE MORE CONCERNED WITH INVESTIGATING ME THAN WHY THE AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY IT IS THAT I DO NOT HAVE A FRONT END TO MY CAR ON THE DRIVERS SIDE AND MY AIRBAG DID NOT GO OFF, BUT THERE IS NO DAMAGE TO THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE AND THAT AIRBAG WENT OFF!!!  THE ADJUSTER THAT HONDA HIRED TO INVESTIGATE THE CLAIM IS DALE S THUMANN, CPCU FOR CSB GROUP.  HE SAID THAT IF I DO NOT GIVE HIM MY HEIGHT, WEIGHT, AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER THAT HONDA WILL JUST DENY MY CLAIM FOR LACK OF COOPERATION.  I AM NOT WHAT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED THE CAR IS!  HE WAS NOT WILLING TO EVEN TAKE THE STEERING WHEEL COVER OFF TO SEE IF THERE WAS EVEN AN AIRBAG IN THE DRIVER SIDE!  HE SAID HE WAS SURE THAT WAS AN AIRBAG IN THERE ... \"THEY MIGHT MISS ONE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.  THEY MAKE MISTAKES.  \" (BUT HE STILL DID NOT FEEL IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE HIM OR ANYONE ELSE CHECK TO SEE IF ONE WAS THERE OR NOT).    PLEASE HELP ME GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS!
