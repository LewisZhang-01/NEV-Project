IT NEARLY KILLED ME! THE CLOSEST DESCRIPTION I HAVE OF THE PROBLEM IS EXPLAINED ON THIS YOUTUBE VIDEO I FOUND HTTPS://YOUTU.BE/JVCRD2LXTI8",

WHEN ATTEMPTING TO DEPRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL THE ABS/BRAKES APPEARED TO MAKE GRINDING/METALLIC NOISES AND THE BRAKE PEDAL WOULD VIBRATE AND GO TO THE FLOOR. I THOUGHT THAT A BRAKE LINE OR FLUID ISSUE MAY HAVE OCCURRED, BUT WHEN I STOPPED THE VEHICLE AND TURNED OFF THE IGNITION I DID NOT SEE ANY VISUAL ISSUES. THEN UPON RESTARTING THE VEHICLE THE ISSUE WAS NO LONGER PRESENT. WHEN I RESEARCHED THIS ISSUE I FOUND HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT NISSAN BRAKES HAVING SIMILAR ISSUES AND FOUND A SERVICE BULLETIN NTB06-040.PDF REGARDING THE ISSUE. UPON USING A SCANTOOL TO READ THE VEHICLE CODES I WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT DTC C1179 WAS PRESENT AND THAT THIS ISSUE WAS RELATED TO THE SERVICE BULLETIN. THE SERVICE BULLETIN INDICATES A SOFTWARE UPDATE ADDRESSES THE ISSUE. I CONTACTED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND THEY INDICATED NISSAN WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ASSIST DUE TO THE AGE OF THE VEHICLE. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS I AM SEEING ONLINE (CLUBARMADA, NISSANHELP, ETC) REGAING THIS ISSUE AND FEEL THAT IF A SOFTWARE UPDATE IS NEEDED TO RESOLVE THAN THERE IS EITHER 1) A SOFTWARE BUG (WHICH NEEDS A RECALL) OR 2) A DEFECTIVE SENSOR (DELTA SENSOR) THAT THE SOFTWARE UPDATE CHOOSES TO IGNORE OR DIMINISH. EITHER WAY A RANDOM BRAKE MALFUNCTION THAT CAN \"FIX\" ITSELF UPON REBOOT (RESTARTING THE VEHICLE) SEEMS SUSPICIOUS AND SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED.",

SO, I REPLACED THE FILTER AND IT WOULD BE GOOD.  HOWEVER, AFTER SEVERAL WEEKS OF DRIVING IT WILL REPEAT THE SAME THING OF JUST SHUTTING OFF WHILE DRIVING.  RECENTLY, IT HAS BEEN SHUTTING DOWN MORE OFTEN.  SO, AFTER SOME LOOKING UNDERNEATH THE HOOD, I WENT BACK TO THE AIR FILTER HOUSING BOX AND DISCOVERED THAT THE AIR FILTER HOUSING BOX DOES NOT SEAL PROPERLY.  AS A RESULT OF THE AIR FILTER HOUSING NOT SEALING PROPERLY, AIR SEEPS IN THROWING OFF THE AIR TO GAS RATIO MIXTURE AND IT SHUTS DOWN THE ENGINE, TURNING OFF THE CAR IN THE MIDST OF DRIVING.  I REPORTED THIS TOO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND THEY SUPPOSEDLY CLEANED  THE AIR FILTER BOX AND SAID THAT SHOULD FIX IT.  HOWEVER, AFTER LEAVING THE DEALERSHIP, MY TRUCK LITERALLY SHUT OFF  ON ME WHILE DRIVING FIVE (5) TIMES.

THIS CAN EASILY BE CONFIRMED BY NISSAN'S THREE CHANGES THEY HAVE MADE TO THE FRONT BRAKES OF THESE VEHICLES EVEN THOUGH THE VEHICLES HAVE ESSENTIALLY REMAINED UNCHANGED FROM YEARS 2004 RIGHT UP THOUGH THE CURRENT MODEL YEAR 2015. THEY FIRST CHANGED THE ROTOR THICKNESS, THEN THE ROTOR DIAMETER (320MM TO 350MM) AND THE CALIPERS/TORQUE MEMBERS/BRAKE HOSES, THEN FINALLY THEY CHANGED THE INNER HUB DIAMETER OF THE ROTOR DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE HUB/BEARING SIZE (82MM TO 90MM).       NISSAN HAD ISSUED AT LEAST ONE TSB ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BUT THEY NEVER ISSUED A RECALL WHICH IS WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE. THE CORE ISSUE IS THAT THESE RATHER LARGE FULL SIZE SUV'S AND PICKUP TRUCKS WERE DESIGNED INITIALLY WITH FRONT BRAKES THAT WERE SEVERELY UNDERSIZED FOR THE WEIGHT/SIZE OF THE VEHICLE. THIS LED TO THE VEHICLES ROTORS EASILY OVERHEATING AND GLAZING THE BRAKE PADS WHICH THEN LED TO HOT SPOTTED, WARPED, OR OTHERWISE RUINED FRONT ROTORS AND PADS. ANOTHER SYMPTOM (THAT I BELIEVE IT CAUSED AND THE MOST DANGEROUS PART) IS THAT ESPECIALLY IN THE WARMER MONTHS THE OVERHEATING OF THE ROTORS WOULD CAUSE THE ANTI LOCK FRONT BRAKE SYSTEM SENSORS (LOCATED WITHIN THE FRONT WHEEL HUB) TO TRIGGER (FALSE POSITIVE) RANDOMLY AND YOU WOULD DANGEROUSLY LOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLES ABILITY TO BRAKE (AND STEER) SAFELY.

THE PROBLEM IS SAFETY RELATED, AND WARRANTS AN INVESTIGATION BY NISSAN, AND RECALL TO ENSURE SAFETY OF VEHICLE OCCUPANTS. THE VEHICLE IS A FULL SIZED SUV, WITH SEATING FOR 7-8 OCCUPANTS. THE PROBLEM I AM REFERRING TO TODAY RELATES TO THE REAR HATCH DOOR. THE REAR HATCH DOOR HANDLES (THERE ARE TWO) ARE SUPPOSED TO OPEN EITHER (1) THE REAR HATCH WINDOW, OR (2) THE REAR HATCH DOOR. FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS NOW I HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE DOOR LATCH NOT ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO OPEN THE DOOR (THE DOOR REMAINS LOCKED AND/OR THE HANDLE MECHANISM IS UNRESPONSIVE). THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE DOOR LOCKING MECHANISM THAT DOES NOT ALLOW THE DOOR TO OPEN. AFTER OPENING UP THE DOOR PANELING TO VIEW THE CONTENTS, THERE IS NOTHING BROKEN OR VISIBLY WRONG, JUST A FAULTY ENGINEERING DESIGN AND/OR COMPONENTS THAT SOMEHOW DO NOT \"MESH\" TO ENSURE PROPER OPERATION. A \"GOOGLE\" INTERNET SEARCH REVEALS THAT THIS PROBLEM IS COMMON WITH MANY ARMADA VEHICLES, AND OWNERS AND SERVICE SHOPS HAVE HAD DIFFICULTIES RECTIFYING THIS PROBLEM. MOST PEOPLE JUST ORDER NEW PARTS BLINDLY HOPING IT WILL FIX THE PROBLEM, AND IN MANY CASES IT HAS NOT.

AS THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT, NISSAN SHOULD RECALL THIS ITEM AND HAVE IT REPAIRED BY TRAINED PERSONNEL, NOT BLINDLY BY CUSTOMERS. I HAVE FURTHER READ THAT IN MANY CASES OWNERS RETURN TO THE DEALERSHIPS ANNUALLY TO HAVE THE ITEM LOOKED AT. AS THIS ISSUE IS OUTSTANDING, IT WARRANTS INVESTIGATION AND A RECALL.

I TOOK THE CAR TO DEALER & THEY STATED THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THE ROTORS WERE OUT OF ROUND. THEY REPLACED THE FRONT ROTORS & PADS, THEY ALSO TURNED THE REAR ROTORS & REPLACED THE REAR PADS. THIS WAS ON 9/7/05.      ON 4/21/07 WHILE DRIVING ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY, I ATTEMPTED TO APPLY MY BRAKES & THE BRAKES DID NOT WORK & THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT STOP. THE BRAKE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON THE DASH &  ON THE SAME DAY, WE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER & THEY RAN A DIAGNOSTIC CHECK ON THE VEHICLE & THEY FOUND THAT ONE OF THE CODES HAD AN ERROR. THE DEALER REPROGRAMMED THE COMPUTER SYSTEM TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.    ON 3/17/08, I WAS DRIVING & I ATTEMPTED TO APPLY MY BRAKES, WHEN THE BRAKES FAILED, THE EMERGENCY BRAKES DID NOT WORK & THE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN ON THE DASH. ONCE AGAIN I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER, I ADVISED THEM AT THE DEALER THAT THIS WAS THE THIRD TIME I HAD BEEN THERE FOR THE SAME ISSUE. THEY ADVISED THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO DO A DIAGNOSTIC TEST, IN WHICH I WOULD HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET SINCE THE VEHICLE IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY. THIS TIME THEY SAID THAT IT WAS AN INTERNAL FAILURE & THE BRAKE BOOSTER NEEDED TO BE REPLACED &  THAT THIS MAY NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. I WAS ADVISED BY THE TECHNICIAN AT THE DEALER THAT THE MANUFACTURER IS AWARE OF THE THIS PROBLEM. OF COURSE, THIS RESOLUTION WAS NOT OFFERED OR ADVISED IN MY PREVIOUS VISITS AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PAID UNDER THE WARRANTY. CONVENIENTLY, I WAS TOLD ABOUT THIS AFTER MY WARRANTY EXPIRED & AFTER PAYING $1,000.00 OUT OF MY POCKET TO FIX.

ALTHOUGH OBSERVED, THE WEEKEND TECHNICIAN FAILED TO PROPERLY RELAY THE SITUATION TO THE REGULAR TECHNICIAN RESULTING IN NO ACTION TAKEN.

I WILL EVEN GO OUT OF MY WAY TO TELL THEM IF I SEE THEM LOOKING AT THEM ON A LOT.  IF NISSAN ISN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO FIX THIS PROBLEM EVEN IF IT MEANS REPLACING THE BRAKE SYSTEM THEN WE AS CONSUMERS SHOULD WARN OTHERS BEFORE SOME ONE LOOSES THEIR LIFE.

MAKES YOU WONDER IF THEY WOULD DRIVE ONE OF THESE CARS. THE NUMBER OF FAILURES ARE FAR MORE THEN WHAT I LISTED.

ON SEPTEMBER 7, 2006 I WAS AT NISSAN AGAIN, AND WAS TOLD THAT NISSAN WOULD NO LONGER MAKE THESE REQUIRED REPAIRED REPAIRS. I WAS ALSO TOLD BY A MECHANIC THAT THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT THE BRAKES AND ROTORS PUT ON THE 2004 ARMADA ARE TOO SMALL FOR THE WEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE, AND THAT IS WHY THE PROBLEM EXISTS.  NISSAN MUST CORRECT THIS PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE IS INJURED OR KILLED AS A RESULT THIS SERIOUS MECHANICAL PROBLEM.   THE NEXT ISSUE IS WITH THE REAR SONAR SYSTEM. THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN IT RAINS THE REAR SONAR GOES OFF WHEN THE VEHICLE IS PLACED IN REVERSE.  I HAVE TAKEN THIS TO NISSAN FOR REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.  THE REPLACED THE SYSTEM ONCE, AND THE PROBLEM HAS RECURRED.  I WAS TOLD BY THE NISSAN SERVICE MANAGER THAT NISSAN IS WORKING TO FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE SYSTEM.  HOWEVER, I HAVE NOT SEEN A SERVICE BULLETIN OR RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM.   THE LAST PROBLEM IS THAT SINCE JUNE 17, 2006 NISSAN HAS REPLACED FOUR (4) RADIOS IN MY VEHICLE.

THE UPPER REAR HIGH MOUNT BRAKE LIGHT HOUSING, ACTUALLY A BODY PART OF THE VEHICLE,  CAME OFF DURING THE EXITING OF THE CAR WASH. THIS HAPPENED WHEN THE BLOWER BLEW THE WATER OFF THE ARMADA AND BLEW THIS HOUSING DOWN ONTO THE REAR WINDOW. UPON INSPECTION THE PLASTIC RIVETS THAT HOLD THE HOUSING IN PLACE HAD SHEERED OFF, AND THE WIND BLEW THE UNIT DOWN ONTO THE WINDOW. THE UNIT CAME DOWN WITH ENOUGH FORCE TO BREAK THE BACK WINDOW AND DID INFECT SCRATCH IT. THE ONLY THING PREVENTING THE UNIT FROM COMING COMPLETELY OFF AND BECOMING A PROJECTILE OBJECT WAS THE WIRING. IT APPEARS THAT THE AUTO MOBILE MAKER IS AWARE OF THIS, BUT DOES NOT WARN CONSUMERS, AND WILL NOT REPAIR THIS DESIGN FLAW WITH SUBSTANTIAL ANCHORS. IN A ROLL OVER THIS COULD COME OFF COMPLETELY AND BECOME A PROJECTILE OBJECT. ADDITIONALLY, UNTIL I AM ABLE TO GET THIS FIXED I AM RIDING AROUND WITHOUT BENEFIT OF A REAR BRAKE LIGHT AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW. I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY OTHERS, ARMADA NEWSGROUP,  THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THESE UNITS, AND THAT NISSAN REFUSES TO ACCEPT THE LIABILITY.

I HAD CONTACTED NISSAN MANUFACTURE CONCERN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. NISSAN ADDRESSED ALL VEHICLES ARE SUPPOSED TO SLIGHTLY VEER TO THE RIGHT WHEN YOUR HAND IS REMOVED FROM THE STEERING WHEEL.  THIS IS A SAFETY PRECAUTION THAT KEEPS VEHICLES FROM GOING INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC IN THE EVENT THE DRIVER FALLS ASLEEP, HAS A HEART ATTACK, STROKE, ETC. I HAD BEEN DRIVING FOR 10 YEARS AND NEVER HEAR ABOUT THIS BEFORE. I HAD DRIVE THE HONDA, TOYOTA, DODGE RAM, ACURA, MALIBU, CHEVY AND NEVER EXPERIENCED ANY VEERING OF THE STEERING WHEEL EITHER TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT. I HAVE BEEN ASKING A LOT OF PEOPLE ABOUT THIS EVERYONE SAID ALL THE VEHICLES HAVE TO GO STRAIGHT WHEN RUNNING ON A GOOD LEVELED ROAD. NISSAN DIDN'T PUT ANY KIND OF WRITING OR NOTE ON THE CONTRACT, VEHICLE SAFETY FEATURES OR VEHICLE DESCRIPTION TO LET THE CUSTOMERS KNOW THAT THE VEHICLE WILL VEER TO THE RIGHT DUE TO SAFETY PRECAUTION. ACCORDINGLY TO THE CONTRACT THE DEALER HAS TO LET THE CUSTOMERS ANY PROBLEM THAT THE VEHICLE HAS. I HAD NEVER BEEN TOLD THAT THIS VEHICLE WILL SLIGHTLY VEER TO THE RIGHT BY SALE REP, SALE MANAGER, AND SO ON. PLEASE HELP ME AND OTHER FOR OUR SAFETY. THANKS.  *AK",

THE SERVICE TECH TOLD US IT IS NORMAL NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE AND SAID THAT NISSAN MADE ALL VEHICLES LIKE THAT. WE DON'T THINK THIS IS RIGHT BECAUSE ALL VEHICLES HAVE TO RUN STRAIGHT NOT LEANING TO NEITHER RIGHT OR LEFT SIDE OF THE FLOATED ROAD AND SHOULD MOVING SMOOTHLY NOT SHAKING WHEN RUN ON THE ROUGH ROAD. THIS IS CONCERNED ME ABOUT MY FAMILY SAFETY. BROWN&BROWN NISSAN SALE MANAGERS WANTED US TO BRING THE CAR TO SERVICE TO GET FIX. SINCE THEIR SERVICE TECH SAID THE PROBLEMS ARE NORMAL AND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE WHEN THOSE SYMPTOMS ABOVE OCCURRED. WE DON'T THINK IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO BRING IT TO THE SERVICE AND LET THEM FIX IT. SO WE HAD REQUEST TO SWITCH FOR ANOTHER VEHICLE BUT THE DEALER GENERAL SALE MANAGERS DISPUTED AND IGNORED MY REQUEST AND DIDN'T CARE ABOUT CUSTOMER SATISFACTION NOR CUSTOMER'S SAFETY. BROWN&BROWN'S  HEAD MANAGER DON'T TALK TO US SINCE WE DON'T WANT TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO THE SERVICE EVEN THOUGH WE HAD CALL IN A LOT OF TIMES AND REQUEST TO TALK TO HIM OR LEFT HIM A MESSAGE ON HIS ANSWER MACHINE. NOW WE ARE STUCK WITH THE LEMON VEHICLE AND DON'T KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO NEXT TO PROTECT OUR CUSTOMER RIGHTS AND OUR FAMILY SAFETY.
