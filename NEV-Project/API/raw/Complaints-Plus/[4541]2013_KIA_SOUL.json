I took to Elite Auto in Feb2022 and they say engine recall on this as piston rings shot why oil blow-by. Was caused by a NHTSA Safety reacll #19V120000 with recall date 2019-02-21 so I took in on 9Mar22 as some outstanding recall items like software update and Catalytic check.  They said on 9Mar22 \"No Issues\" with Catalytic converter. less than 3 days later on 12Mar22 I broke down driving less than 60 miles to northwest side of Houston with code P0240 Catalytic inefficiency trying to get to my kids who were broke down from a flat tire near 290 and 610.  I towed to Clear lake area w/ AAA and on Monday 14th had towed over to Gay Family Kia. I was expecting to get a Catalytic converter replaced due to the NHTSA Safety recall as the damage caused to my 2013 Engine but after 2 weeks of waiting on 24MAR22 I was told by Roy that I would have to pay for the catalytic converter nearly $2k which should be covered under the Safety recall.  I also should be provided a new engine as existing is sucking oil due to piston ring damage.  At the moment, my Kia is in the Gay Family Service center and it seems any recall on my vehicle has been zeroed out of the national database even though any Catalytic converter upgrades have not been completed.   My trust in Kia products has been damaged. My trust in Gay Family Kia service center is also damaged as I was stuck without transportation for 2 weeks.  And though my vehicle has 139k miles why won't they change out the engine if there is piston ring damage that was caused by their faulty catalytic converter that they don't want to pay to change out even though the NHTSA 19V120000 safety recall clearly states is result of overheating Catalytic Converters.

They have told me that Fred Anderson Kia will not return their outreach calls, and they would refer my case # 14586235 to the district manager for a callback -- which has not happened. They tell me the DM\u2019s name and contact information are secret, so I can not call them.   Q1: The frame welds. I have covered some of the leaking areas with JD Weld, but the welds are unaltered and could be inspected by removing the JD Weld. I also took several pictures. The leak is still present.   Q2: The leak caused interior damage, including mold, and could damage electrical components due to moisture, rust, or fire.  Q3: Fred Anderson Kia of Raleigh verified the leak but could not correctly diagnose it. McConnell Auto Glass verified the leak.  Q4: Yes, Fred Anderson Kia of Raleigh on 6/7/21, 6/25/21 and 7/20/21  Q5: I noticed the wet carpet shortly after I purchased the car, but there is evidence of long-term damage.",

This is scary to think about not being warned that your car is out of oil and continuing to drive, when the engine could seize.   The real issue is that the car is consuming oil. I am going through a quart a week just to keep up. I drive 500-600 miles a week. Kia will tell you that adding oil in-between oil changes is normal. There is nothing normal about having to give it this much. The car is not smoking and the car is not leaking. I had it checked by my mechanic, and they replaced the PCV valve. They said this was a long shot, and the next step would be to replace the engine. The valve replacement did little to help the consumption of oil. I know there are other cars in Kia's offering that have leaked oil into the pistons, I am thinking this could be one of them.",

EARLIER THIS YEAR MY CAR BEGAN SHOWING THE SIGNS OF THE FURTHER DAMAGE NOTED IN THE RECALL DETAILS. IN APRIL 2020 MY CAR RANDOMLY STALLED WHEN IN MOTION ON A CITY STREET AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. I WAS ABLE TO COAST OFF THE ROAD AND EVENTUALLY START THE CAR AGAIN. THE PANDEMIC PREVENTED ME FROM HAVING IT SERVICED AT MY KIA DEALERSHIP OR ELSEWHERE. SINCE APRIL, THIS HAS OCCURRED FIVE TIMES, BOTH ON CITY STREETS AND THE HIGHWAY WHILE IN MOTION. THE HIGHWAY EVENT WAS FRIGHTENING AS I WAS IN HEAVY TRAFFIC TRAVELLING AT 60 MPH. MY LOCAL ONE STOP OIL CHANGE RE-OPENED AND I WAS ABLE TO GET AN OIL CHANGE MAY 5, 2020 AT 110,431, THEN AGAIN ON AUGUST 24, 2020 AT 114,121 MILES AT ONE STOP (RECEIPT ATTACHED). A WEEK LATER MY ENGINE OIL PRESSURE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON DESPITE THE RECENT OIL CHANGE. I ADDED OIL, BUT IN TWO WEEKS THE LEVEL IS AGAIN LOW AND I PUT IN 2 QUARTS. I TOOK IT TO THE KIA SERVICE CENTER SEPTEMBER 16, 2020 AT 115,179, AND THE OIL WAS AGAIN LOW AS SHOWN ON THE ATTACHED RECEIPT. KIA SERVICE WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE LOST OIL. ALTHOUGH MY CAR HAD THE REPAIR PERFORMED FOR THE RECALL, I'M AFRAID THE PISTON HAS BEEN DAMAGED, CAUSING THE ENGINE STALLS. MY OIL IS LEAKING OUT SOMEWHERE, SO I FEAR IT MAY BE THE BROKEN CONNECTING ROD THAT HAS PUNCTURED THE ENGINE BLOCK ALLOWING THE ENGINE OIL TO ESCAPE. THE KIA QUOTE FOR THE BRAKE, EXHAUST AND TIRE WORK WAS EXPENSIVE, SO I HAD A FRIEND'S EXPERT MECHANIC DO THE REPAIRS FOR LESS. HE WARNED ME THAT THE OIL WAS LEAKING OUT AND THE ENGINE MAY BLOW AND I'LL NEED A NEW ENGINE, AND STRONGLY SUGGESTED I SELL THE CAR BEFORE THAT OCCURS. I CANNOT, IN GOOD CONSCIENCE, SELL IT KNOWING THE RISK TO A NEW OWNER. I HOPE THIS EXPLANATION WILL LEAD TO KIA REPAIRING MY CAR PROPERLY.",

WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY HAD IT IN AND OUT IN 15-20 MINUTES AND THEY SAID ONLY HAD TO DO AN UPDATE. WHICH WAS IRRITATING, CONSIDERING I HAD ASKED THEM TO CHECK MY CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND THEY DIDN'T. BECAUSE PRIOR TO THAT A MECHANIC IN MY TOWN THOUGHT SOMETHING COULD HAVE BEEN WRONG WITH IT. WELL HERE I AM IN 2020, AND I WENT BACK TO THIS DEALERSHIP (THIS IS THE ONLY KIA IN MY AREA). LAST YEAR IN MAY THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THE MDPS COUPLING. THE LETTER ALSO STATED THAT THEY EXTENDED THE WARRANTY TO 100,000 MILES- I'M RIGHT AROUND 96,500 MILES SO I AM STILL COVERED.I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND ASKED TO GET IT FIXED SINCE I WAS EXPERIENCING NOISES IN MY STEERING WHEEL TURNING LEFT OR RIGHT/ AND WHEN VEHICLE IS STOPPED. THEY SAID YES, I SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE ADVISOR AND HE TOLD ME THAT I WOULD BE COVERED. SO I TOOK MY CAR UP THERE THURSDAY THE 28TH TO GET THIS SERVICED. ANOTHER WORKER TOLD ME IN PERSON MY COUPLING WASN'T THAT BAD, AND I COULD ALWAYS COME BACK IN THE FUTURE TO GET IT REPAIRED. HE THEN FURTHER TOLD ME THAT MY POWER-STEERING RACK WAS MAKING A LITTLE NOISE TOO, BUT THAT WOULDN'T NEED TO BE REPAIRED FOR ANOTHER 5-10 YEARS.THEN HE CHARGED ME $65 DOLLARS FOR A DIAGNOSTIC FEE, WHICH IS COMPLETELY WRONG. I CALLED KIA COOPERATE, SPOKE WITH NUMEROUS OF FOLKS. I WAS TOLD ON THURSDAY BY COOPERATE THAT THEY CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THEM MY COMPLAINT. BUT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. SO I CALLED COOPERATE BACK DEMANDING TO TALK TO MY CASE WORKER, [XXX] WHICH SHE HASN'T CALLED ME BACK. I FEEL LIKE THEY AREN'T TAKING ME SERIOUS. I'VE HAD TWO PAST RECALLS ON THIS VEHICLE, AND WASN'T HANDLED APPROPRIATELY. I ALSO SHOULDN'T OF BEEN CHARGED A DIAGNOSTIC FEE. I WANT A REFUND AS WELL.

I DO NOT KNOW HER SPEED BUT CAN SAY THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG AND BOTH FRONT AIRBAGS DEPLOYED,  THE SPEED LIMIT ON THE ROAD SHE WAS TRAVELING IS 40 MPH.    THE REASON FOR THIS REPORT IS THAT THE IMPACT CAUSED THE REAR VIEW MIRROR TO SNAP OFF AND BECOME AN AIRBORNE MENACE.  THE MIRROR GAVE ME A LARGE LUMP JUST ABOVE MY RIGHT EYE AND CAUSED A CONTUSION ON MY RIGHT CHEEK THAT AFTER BLEEDING PROFUSELY NEEDED FOUR STITCHES TO CLOSE.      I WAS LUCKY.  THE JAGGED EDGE THAT CUT MY CHEEK WAS ONLY A COUPLE INCHES FROM MY EYE AND POTENTIAL BLINDNESS.    THE MIRROR'S (MODEL ZTVHL3) PHYSICAL CONNECTION FAILED AT THE JUNCTURE OF THE BALL JOINT AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD AND THE METAL CONDUIT AT THE REAR OF THE MIRROR.     THE METAL WAS UNABLE TO WITHSTAND THE FORCE OF THE SIDE IMPACT AND TORQUED OUT OF SHAPE. THE WIRING ALONE WAS UNABLE TO HOLD THE MIRROR IN PLACE, AND THE MIRROR WENT AIRBORNE.",

WE ALWAYS COMPLETELY CLEAR SNOW FROM ALL GLASS SURFACES AND CHECK THE OPERATION OF THE WIPERS BEFORE DRIVING THE CAR.     WE BOUGHT AN EXPENSIVE TELESCOPING COMBINATION SCRAPER, BRUSH AND SQUEEGEE DESIGNED FOR CMVS TO CLEAR AS MUCH SNOW AS WE CAN REACH AND SEE FROM THE WHITE PAINTED ROOF OF THE CAR BEFORE DRIVING IT. AFTER THE INTERIOR OF THE CAR WARMS UP IT APPEARS TO LOOSEN THE BOND BETWEEN THE ROOF OF THE CAR AND ANY RESIDUAL OR NEWLY ACCUMULATED SNOW. NUMEROUS TIMES WHEN UNDER NORMAL BRAKING SNOW HAS SLID FORWARD OFF THE ROOF ON TO THE WINDSHIELD OBSCURING ALL FORWARD VISIBILITY AND INSTANTLY CREATING A SEVERE COLLISION SAFETY HAZARD.    FURTHERMORE, WHEN THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE ACTIVATED TO CLEAR THE SNOW THE WIPER MOTORS ARE TOO WEAK TO MOVE THE SNOW REQUIRING THE DRIVER TO BLINDLY BRAKE TO A STOP UNABLE TO SEE WELL ENOUGH EVEN TO STEER THE CAR OUT OF THE LANE OF TRAFFIC TO A SAFE PLACE TO STOP. THIS HAPPENED A FEW DAYS AGO AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT AT A BUSY INTERSECTION IN SLICK SNOWY ROAD CONDITIONS DURING EVENING RUSH HOUR. AFTER COMING TO A STOP WITHOUT HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF HER MY FIVE FOOT, TWO INCH TALL 68 YEAR OLD WIFE HAD TO GET OUT OF THE CAR IN DANGEROUS CONDITIONS AND MANUALLY REMOVE(FOR THE SECOND TIME) SNOW FROM THE WINDSHIELD WHILE BEING SUBJECTED TO HONKING HORNS AND ONE-FINGERED SALUTES FROM ILL-MANNERED MOTORISTS.
