        "summary": "On Sunday December 19, 2021, while driving home the warning light for the battery/alternator flashed on with an associated beep warning. An estimated 30 miles later all electrical and motor functions died while I was in heavy traffic. I was able to pull off onto a narrow shoulder up a steep hill and park. All functions quit, I could not come out of \"Park\", the emergency brake switch would not release, the emergency flashers did not function. Nothing responded. I called AAA Towing service to be taken to an Audi service repair shop.  The towing service had to use a jumper to provide electrical power to release the emergency brake and take the transmission out of \"park.\"  The repair service was the \"Sport Hous Reno\" where the alternator and the battery were replaced. Invoice # 4791, 12-21-2021, total $1,709.12.  I do not expect the battery to be covered since it is expendable. However, the alternator malfunction and this model of Audi completely dying placed me in a dangerous situation where I or my family could have been seriously injured.  This is not my first Audi, I did have a similar occurrence with another model and when the battery caused a malfunction the Audi computer went in \"Limp Mode\" and I was able to drive slowly to the dealership.  This was not the case, when the electrical system failed it did not go into \"Limp Mode,\" it completely \"Died\" placing me and my car in a dangerous position.",

THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD BEGIN THE RECALL WORK, BUT IT WAS A RECALL THAT INVOLVED THE 50000 MILE WARRANTY. I WAS NEARING 55000 MILES, BUT THEY WOULD DUE THE WORK UNDER WARRANTY. AT 2 PM, I WAS INFORMED THAT THERE WAS INTERNAL DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE AND THEY WOULD NEED TO KEEP THE VEHICLE FOR SEVERAL DAYS. THEY PROVIDED A RENTAL CAR UNTIL THEY COMPLETED THE WORK. MY COMPLAINT IS THAT I NEVER RECEIVED ANY NOTICE??? THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT THE ISSUE WITH THE CAMSHAFT PROBLEM WENT OUT IN JUNE 2011. THAT WAS ONE MONTH AFTER THE MAINE DEALER PERFORMED MY 35000 MILE MAINTENANCE!!!  THE POINT IS THAT THE LONGER I DROVE THE VEHICLE, THE WORSE THE PROBLEM PROGRESSED. THEY SAID THAT EVENTUALLY, I WOULD LOOSE THE ENGINE.  *TR",

ONE THE 2ND DAY WE OWNED THE CAR THE OIL LIGHT CAME ON AND WE HAD TO RETURN IT TO THE DEALER FOR MORE OIL.  OVER THE NEXT 2 YEARS THE CAR BURNED AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF OIL STARTING AT 1 QRT EVERY 2500 MILES AND DETERIORATING TO 1 QRT EVERY 800 MILES. ALL ALONG THE DEALER TOLD US THIS WAS \"NORMAL\".  IN MAY 2011, DEALER TOLD US THAT AUDI HAD INITIATED A TESTING PROGRAM AND IF THE CAR FAILED THEY WOULD DO SOMETHING.  IN JUNE 2011, THE CAR FAILED TEST AND THE DEALER KEPT THE CAR FOR 3+ WEEKS CONDUCTING MAJOR ENGINE SURGERY.  6000 MILES LATER WE TOOK THE CAR IN FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND THEY SAID THEY WANTED TO DO ROUTINE WARRANTY WORK.  IN THE COURSE OF THIS WORK, THEY DESTROYED THE TIMING CHAIN AND PISTONS OF THE CAR.  1 WEEK LATER THE TRANSMISSION FAILED.  IN TALKING TO AUDI TECHNICIANS AT OTHER DEALERS (OFF THE RECORD) THEY SAY THAT THE OIL PROBLEM IS A DESIGN PROBLEM AND THAT THE FIXES ARE SIMPLY BANDAIDS. APPEARS THAT THE 2012 MODEL HAS BEEN REDESIGNED TO FIX THE ENGINE FLAW.  THE NET EFFECT IS THAT THE CAR HAS VISITED THE AUDI DEALER ON AT LEAST A MONTHLY BASIS SINCE WE BOUGHT IT AND HAS SPEND MORE THAN 8 WEEKS IN MAJOR \"WARRANTY RELATED\" ENGINE REPAIRS.  TO TOP IT OFF, AUDI HAS COMPLIMENTED THIS \"WORST IN CLASS\" PRODUCT EXPERIENCE WITH A \"WORST IN CLASS\" CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE AS AUDI AMERICA 1-800 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY EITHER ROBOTIC OR RUDE IN TALKING WITH US ABOUT THIS ISSUE.  MOST RECENTLY, THEY MADE A LAME OFFER TO REIMBURSE US FOR TOWING EXPENSES AND EXTEND THE WARRANTY ON THIS DUBIOUS CAR FOR ANOTHER 12 MONTHS.  AMAZINGLY, THEY REFUSE TO PU T THE OFFER IN WRITING UNTIL AFTER ACCEPTANCE.  PRESUMABLY SO THAT THEY CAN AVOID LEGAL ISSUES.  PLEASE HELP.  I AM SURE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE SUFFERING THIS.  *TR",
