IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THE AIRBAGS HAVE DRIED OUT OR BECAME EFFECTED DUE TO THESE LARGE CRACKS AS WELL AS WHAT OTHER DAMAGE IT COULD BE CAUSING ELECTRONICALLY? AM I GOING TO END UP IN SOME HORRIFIC CAR ACCIDENT DUE TO AIRBAG RELEASE WHEN JUST DRIVING DOWN THE INTERSTATE AND THEN IT ALL BE MY FAULT FOR SWEVING OVER IN ANOTHER LANE AND CAUSE THE ACCIDENT! THEN IT WILL LOOK AS IF I WERE AT FAULT AND AIRBAGS DEPLOYED AS THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE, INSTEAD OPENED PREMATURELY DUE TO DEFECTIVE PARTS? OF COURSE THIS IS A HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION BUT I WOULD THINK TOTALLY PLAUSIBLE!!!

JULIAN REITERATED THAT MY ISSUE WAS NOT APPLICABLE TO THE RECALL AND SUGGESTED THAT I TAKE THE VEHICLE TO AN ACURA DEALERSHIP AT MY OWN EXPENSE. I INFORMED JULIAN THAT I WAS NOT PLEASED WITH HIS DECISION TO DISMISS MY INQUIRY AND I REQUESTED HIS CONTACT INFORMATION TO FILE A FORMAL COMPLAINT, WHICH HE REFUSED TO GIVE ME.    I AM REACHING OUT TODAY BECAUSE MY VEHICLE HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY NHTSA RECALL NUMBER: 04V-176 AND I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT ANYONE WOULD FIND ACCEPTABLE IN RESOLVING THIS ISSUE. I WOULD LIKE FOR MY VEHICLE TO BE REPAIRED BY ACURA AT NO EXPENSE TO ME AND FOR SOMEONE AT ACURA TO FOLLOW UP WITH ME BY THE END OF THIS WEEK WITH A RESOLUTION TO THIS MATTER.",

WENT TO TAKE THE CAR OUT TO THE STORE THE NEXT MORNING AND NOTICED A LARGE CRACK GOING FROM THE WINDSHIELD TOWARDS THE PASSENGER SEAT ACROSS THE AIR BAG.  THE NEXT DAY 2 MORE CRACKS APPEARED, AND THE NEXT DAY AN ADDITIONAL 2 CRACKS.    FOR A CAR THAT HAD BEEN BEYOND WELL KEPT AND PAMPERED, NOT TO MENTION A 'LUXURY' CAR, SHOULD NOT BE IN THIS STATE.  I HAVE FRIENDS WITH ACURAS AND HONDAS MUCH OLDER THAN MINE THAT HAVE SPENT THEIR ENTIRE LIVES SITTING OUTSIDE IN THE TEXAS HEAT AND HAVE NOT A SINGLE CRACK ON THE DASHBOARD, YET MINE WHICH HAS LIVED A \"SHELTERED\" LIFE HAS OVER 6 NOW.    AFTER MUCH RESEARCH ON THE WEB, I NOTICED I AM NOT THE ONLY OWNER WITH THIS ISSUE.  WHAT MAKES THIS MORE ANNOYING IS LOOKING AT PICTURES POSTED FROM OTHER OWNERS, THE PLACES WHERE THE CRACKS FORM AND GROW ARE ALMOST NEARLY IDENTICAL.    THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE FOR THIS BRAND OF VEHICLE AND THE FACT THAT A RECALL OR AN OFFER FORM ACURA TO REPLACE THIS DASHBOARDS HAS NOT BEEN MADE.  ONE OR TWO PEOPLE HAVING THE ISSUE CAN BE OVER LOOKED.  HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE IN THE SAME LOCATIONS IS A DEFECT.    ACURA SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. I BOUGHT THIS CAR BECAUSE OF THEIR REPUTATION.  NOW THEIR REPUTATION HAS NO MEANING TO ME.  IF I HADN'T PAID SO MUCH FOR THE CAR TO START WITH AND THE FACT THAT REPLACING IT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS FOR A CAR THAT FOR THE MOST PART IS STILL LIKE NEW WOULD BE INSANE.  *TR",

AS THE CRACK HAS EXPANDED WITHIN THE PAST WEEK, I HAVE FOUND THAT JUST ABOVE THE CENTER CONSOLE, THE AIRBAG HAS BEEN PUSHED TO THE SIDE, CAUSING THE AIRBAG TO BUBBLE UP IN THE CENTER.  I CALLED ACURA AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY GIVE DISCOUNTS ON THE PRODUCT BECAUSE IT SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN AND BECAUSE IT WASN'T MY FAULT, JUST A FAULTY PRODUCT THAT HAS BEEN DISCOVERED IN SEVERAL OTHER STATES. I TALKED TO THE DISTRICT MANAGER OF GUNN ACURA IN SA,TX ABOUT THE ISSUE AND WAS TOLD THAT SINCE I HAVEN'T USED ACURA'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE (PRETTY MUCH SAYING THAT I HAVEN'T GIVEN THEM ENOUGH MONEY), THEY WOULD GIVE ME ONLY A 15% DISCOUNT WHEN I WAS TOLD TO EXPECT AROUND 75%. MY CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY BUT I DON'T SEE HOW THAT WOULD MATTER IF IT WAS BOUND TO HAPPEN ANYWAY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS DEFECT ISN'T A RECALL. THE DISTRICT MANAGER TOLD ME THAT IF ANYTHING, THE AIRBAG WOULD COME OUT FASTER IF NEEDED SINCE THERE IS ALREADY A CRACK TO OPEN IT UP. BUT THAT MIGHT NOT BE A GOOD THING, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS PUSHED OUT OF THE WAY AND HOW THE AIRBAG DOESN'T COME OUT OF THE DASHBOARD.  WHEN I SPOKE TO THE DISTRICT MANAGER, THE FIRST THING I WAS TOLD WAS THAT THE OFFER IS STAYING THE SAME, NO MATTER WHAT. HE CHECKED HIS NOTES AND DECIDED A PRICE BEFORE EVEN CONSULTING ME OR ASKING QUESTIONS. HE WAS SET ON A RATE BEFORE HE EVEN SPOKE WITH ME. THE PRICE HASN'T CHANGED AND I AM EXPECTED TO PAY FOR A $2000 DASHBOARD WITH A 15% DISCOUNT. MY MAIN CONCERN IS THAT THE AIRBAG WILL DEPLOY ANY DAY NOW FOR NO REASON.

IN THE TWO AND A HALF YEARS SINCE THE PURCHASE, SIGNIFICANT CRACKS HAVE APPEARED ON THE DASHBOARD OF THIS CAR. THERE ARE SEVERAL CRACKS ON THE DASH IN FRONT OF THE DRIVING PANEL. THERE ARE ALSO TWO MAJOR CRACKS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE, EACH ONE RUNNING FROM THE WINDSHIELD ALL THE WAY TO THE GLOVE BOX. WHAT MAKES THIS WORRISOME IS THAT EACH CRACK RUNS ALONG THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG, WHICH IS WEAKENING THE INTEGRITY OF THAT AIRBAG. I AM CONCERNED THAT THESE CRACKS COULD CAUSE THE PASSENGER AIRBAG TO DEPLOY UNEXPECTEDLY, INJURING ANY PASSENGER IN THAT SEAT AND POSSIBLY EVEN CAUSING AN ACCIDENT. IT COULD ALSO CAUSE THE AIRBAG TO DEPLOY IMPROPERLY DURING AN ACCIDENT, AND EITHER FAIL TO PREVENT INJURY OR MAKE THE PASSENGER'S INJURIES WORSE.    THIS DEFECT IS OCCURRING IN THE 2004 AND 2005 MODELS, BUT ACURA IS TREATING IT AS A COSMETIC ISSUE RATHER THAN A SAFETY ONE, AND REFUSING TO COVER THE EXPENSE OF REPLACING THE DASH, WHICH COSTS ALMOST $2000 INCLUDING LABOR AND PARTS. OTHER 2004/2005 TL OWNERS WHO HAD THE DASH REPLACED WERE TOLD THAT THE NEW DASH WAS MADE WITH DIFFERENT MATERIALS AND WOULD NOT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.  THIS IS A DE FACTO ADMISSION THAT THESE DASHBOARDS WERE MADE WITH INADEQUATE MATERIALS. THIS IS INDEED A SAFETY ISSUE, AS IT INVOLVES THE AIRBAG. THESE CRACKS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY COMPROMISING THE SAFETY OF THIS CAR, AND ACURA NEEDS TO ISSUE A SAFETY RECALL RATHER THAN TREAT IT LIKE A COSMETIC ISSUE. *TR",

I SHUT THE CAR OFF, TURNED IT BACK ON AND IT WORKED FINE FOR ANOTHER TWO MILES BEFORE ACTING UP AGAIN. I TOOK THE CAR TO HARPER ACURA OF KNOXVILLE AND THEY SUGGESTED I GET A POWER FLUSH OF THE TRANSMISSION AND THAT WOULD MOST LIKELY SOLVE THE PROBLEM, SO I AGREED. LATER THAT DAY I PICKED UP THE CAR, (RICHARD, SERVICE MANAGER) SAID THEY FLUSHED THE SYSTEM, ADDED SOME TYPE OF GEL ADDITIVE TO LOCK IN WHATEVER WAS LOSE INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION AND THAT THE MORE I DROVE IT THE BETTER IT WILL BE. WELL I TOOK IT HOME, DROVE IT AROUND AND IT KEPT ACTING UP, I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF IT AND KEPT DRIVING PER RICHARDS SUGGESTION. CAR STILL SLIPS OUT OF SECOND GEAR GOING UP HILLS OR AT TRAFFIC LIGHT. I'M HAVING TO SHUT THE CAR OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC AND THEN RE-START AND DRIVE OFF, BUT I'M AFRAID IF I KEEP DRIVING LIKE THIS, TRANSMISSION WILL COMPLETELY FAIL.

THERE WAS NOTHING BUT THE REMAINS OF SIDEWALL ON THE RIM. THE POLICE OFFICER AND THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER SAID THEY'D NOT SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BUT THAT WE WERE CORRECT IN NOT STOPPING ON THE BRIDGE. UPON RESEARCH, WE FOUND THAT THIS COMPLAINT OF  A SUDDEN BLOW-OUT HAS COME UP SEVERAL TIMES WITH THIS PARTICULAR TIRE. I AM GLAD THAT IT DID NOT HAPPEN AT A HIGHER SPEED OR IN A SITUATION WHERE THE OUTCOME COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE. AS IT WAS, WE WERE JUST DELAYED ON OUR TRIP BY A FEW HOURS. FORTUNATELY, THE STORE WHERE WE PURCHASED THE TIRES A FEW WEEKS BEFORE (AT ALMOST  $900.00) REPLACED ALL FOUR TIRES WITH YOKOHAMA, THE BRAND THAT IS ORIGINAL TO OUR CAR. THE CAR IS DEALER MAINTAINED AND I AM CAREFUL TO CHECK AIRPRESSURE WHEN I FILL UP THE TANK. AT ANY RATE, THE SUDDEN DEFLATION WAS EXTRAORDINARY, AND AS NO OTHER VEHICLES SEEMED TO BE HAVING THE PROBLEM, I DOUBT THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE ROAD THAT CAUSED IT. THE TIRES ONLY HAD 2,000 MILES ON THEM, AND THEY HAD A 60,000 MILE WARRANTY. THIS WAS NOT A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE AND I WOULD HOPE THAT A RECALL IS FORTHCOMING BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT OR WORSE. *TR",

I WAS ABLE TO NAVIGATE/COAST THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER TOOK THE CAR TO NORTHEAST ACURA.  AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, THE CAR HAD 61,634 MILES ON IT.  I DIDN'T HEAR FROM NORTHEAST ACURA FOR OVER A WEEK.  THE SERVICE ADVISOR (STEPHEN WITTEK) VERIFIED THAT THE BALL JOINT HAD SNAPPED AND IT HAD CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE DRIVESHAFT.  AT THIS POINT I ASKED HIM IF IT WAS NORMAL TO ONLY REPLACE ONE BALL JOINT.  HE SAID, NORMALLY, YOU'RE RIGHT.  BUT THE LEFT SIDE BALL JOINT DIDN'T SHOW ANY WEAR AT ALL.  IN FACT, THE RIGHT BALL JOINT DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGN OF WEAR EITHER.  IT JUST BROKE - IT WASN'T ACTUALLY THE JOINT THAT FAILED BUT THE SUSPENSION ARM THAT HELD THE BALL PORTION OF THE JOINT.  THERE WAS NO SIGN OF DAMAGE.  IT JUST BROKE.  WE'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS.  NOTE THE QUOTATION MARKS.    I CALLED NORTHEAST ACURA AGAIN ON FRIDAY, JANUARY 18, 2008 AT APPROXIMATELY 3:00 P.M. TO CONFIRM THAT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE OPEN ON SATURDAY SO THAT I COULD PICK UP MY CAR.  I ASKED THE PERSON TO ENSURE THEY PUT THE BROKEN PARTS FROM THE REPAIR IN MY TRUNK.  SHE STATED THAT THEY HAD ALREADY DISPOSED OF THE BROKEN PARTS.  I FIND IT HIGHLY DOUBTFUL THAT THOSE PARTS WERE NOT RETRIEVABLE ONE DAY AFTER THE REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED.  IN MY SUBSEQUENT DEALINGS WITH ACURA OF NORTH AMERICA CUSTOMER SERVICE, THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP (KEVIN MCCARTHY) STATED THAT IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO REQUEST THAT THE PART BE RETAINED FOR INSPECTION OF MATERIAL FAILURE.  THEY OBVIOUSLY KNEW IT WAS MATERIAL FAILURE (SEE THE QUOTED PASSAGE ABOVE) AND FAILED TO RETAIN THE PART OR REPORT IT TO ACURA OF NORTH AMERICA.

I BELIEVE THAT BOTH ACURA AND BRIDGESTONE SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR REPLACING THIS TIRE ON ALL EXISTING VEHICLES. THIS TIRE EXHIBITS UNSAFE CHARACTERISTICS IN WET WEATHER, WITH NOTICEABLE DRIFT AND HYDROPLANING IN ANY AMOUNT OF STANDING WATER, EVEN AS LITTLE AS 1/16 INCH. IN HEAVY RAINS, EVEN WITH NO STANDING WATER PRESENT, THE TIRE SEEMS INCAPABLE OF DISPERSING WATER AS QUICKLY AS IT FALLS, AGAIN LEADING TO VEHICLE INSTABILITY. FROM A RIDE QUALITY POINT OF VIEW THE TIRE IS ALSO UNSATISFACTORY IN THAT IT FLAT SPOTS EVERY MORNING, ESPECIALLY IN COOL WEATHER BUT EVEN IN WARMER WEATHER AS WELL, LEADING TO VIBRATIONS IN THE INITIAL MILES OF ANY DRIVE. IT IS ALSO ESPECIALLY HARSH OVER ROADWAY EXPANSION JOINTS, AND IS SO LOUD ON CONCRETE PAVEMENTS THAT IT POSES A SAFETY HAZARD DUE TO DRIVER FATIGUE INDUCED BY THE CONTINUOUS NOISE. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE AN ISSUE REGARDING THE RATING AS AN \"ALL SEASON TIRE\" WITH MANY OWNERS REPORTING THAT THIS TIRE IS VIRTUALLY USELESS IN ANY KIND OF SNOW CONDITIONS.  *JB",

I ASSERT THAT THE CRACK WAS THE LIKELY RESULT OF A UNDETECTED DEFECT IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND/OR THE PARTICULAR MATERIALS USED, AND THAT IT WAS THE ACCENTUATION OF THE PRE-EXISTING CRACK ASSOCIATED WITH THE 'IMPACTS' OF NORMAL DRIVING THAT CAUSED  THE TIRE TO SUDDENLY FAIL.THE DEALER ASSERTS THAT THERE WAS OBSERVABLE DAMAGE TO THE RIM, BUT IS UNABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH DAMAGE RESULTED IN THE CRACK OR THAT THE DAMAGE WAS THE RESULT OF THE RIM HAVING BEEN WEAKENED BY THE CRACK PLUS THE IMPACT OF THE RIM WITH THE ROAD SURFACE WHEN THE TIRE DEFLATED.  MY UNREIMBURSED COST FOR A NEW RIM, TIRE, AND ALIGNMENT WAS $625. MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS AN EQUIPMENT PROBLEM, PERHAPS INHERENT TO THE USE OF ALLOY RIMS; THAT ACURA IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM (REPORTS FREQUENT SIMILAR OCCURRENCES) AND THAT THEY SIMPLY REFUSE TO HONOR CLAIMS FOR THIS TYPE OF EQUIPMENT FAILURE UNDER THE WARRANTY. AS A HIGHWAY SAFETY RESEARCHER I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS IS A POTENTIALLY SERIOUS CRASH RISK PROBLEM OVER AND ABOVE THE PROBLEM OF MANUFACTURER AND DEALER INTEGRITY IN HONORING WARRANTY CLAIMS.*AK",

IN HEAVY RAINS, EVEN WITH NO STANDING WATER PRESENT, THE TIRE SEEMS INCAPABLE OF DISPERSING WATER AS QUICKLY AS IT FALLS, AGAIN LEADING TO VEHICLE INSTABILITY. FROM A RIDE QUALITY POINT OF VIEW THE TIRE IS ALSO UNSATISFACTORY IN THAT IT FLAT SPOTS EVERY MORNING, ESPECIALLY IN COOL WEATHER BUT EVEN IN WARMER WEATHER AS WELL, LEADING TO VIBRATIONS IN THE INITIAL MILES OF ANY DRIVE. IT IS ALSO ESPECIALLY HARSH OVER ROADWAY EXPANSION JOINTS, AND IS SO LOUD ON CONCRETE PAVEMENTS THAT IT POSES A SAFETY HAZARD DUE TO DRIVER FATIGUE INDUCED BY THE CONTINUOUS NOISE.

AFTER JUST A SHORT TIME I HAVE FOUND THIS TIRE TO BE ENTIRELY UNSAFE AND UNSUITABLE TO THIS VEHICLE. I BELIEVE THAT BOTH ACURA AND BRIDGESTONE SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR REPLACING THIS TIRE ON ALL EXISTING VEHICLE. THIS TIRE EXHIBITS UNSAFE CHARACTERISTICS IN WET WEATHER, WITH NOTICEABLE DRIFT AND HYDROPLANING IN ANY AMOUNT OF STANDING WATER, EVEN AS LITTLE AS 1/16 INCH. IN HEAVY RAINS, EVEN WITH NO STANDING WATER PRESENT, THE TIRE SEEMS INCAPABLE OF DISPERSING WATER AS QUICKLY AS IT FALLS, AGAIN LEADING TO VEHICLE INSTABILITY. FROM A RIDE QUALITY POINT OF VIEW THE TIRE IS ALSO UNSATISFACTORY IN THAT IT FLAT SPOTS EVERY MORNING, ESPECIALLY IN COOL WEATHER BUT EVEN IN WARMER WEATHER AS WELL, LEADING TO VIBRATIONS IN THE INITIAL MILES OF ANY DRIVE. IT IS ALSO ESPECIALLY HARSH OVER ROADWAY EXPANSION JOINTS, AND IS SO LOUD ON CONCRETE PAVEMENTS THAT IT POSES A SAFETY HAZARD DUE TO DRIVER FATIGUE INDUCED BY THE CONTINUOUS NOISE. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE MAY BE AN ISSUE REGARDING THE RATING AS AN \"ALL SEASON TIRE\" WITH MANY OWNERS REPORTING THAT THIS TIRE IS VIRTUALLY USELESS IN ANY KIND OF SNOW OR ICE CONDITION.

THE ACURA DEALER WAS UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE VSA FAULT CODES ARE NOT STORED IN THE VEHICLE'S MEMORY AFTER THE CAR IS RESTARTED AND THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY RESETS.  THIS RESULTED IN HAVING TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE CAR UNTIL THE FAULT RE-OCCURED.  EVENTUALLY, WHEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN, I WAS ABLE TO TAKE THE CAR DIRECTLY TO DEALER AND THEY WERE ABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE CAR (BECAUSE WE LEFT IT RUNNING SO AS NOT TO CLEAR THE CODE).  THE PROBLEM WAS TRACED TO A YAW RATE SENSOR IN THE VSA SYSTEM.  ACURA SHOULD MAKE THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO DEALERS.   THIS POSES A SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND THERE IS NOTHING A DRIVER CAN DO TO PREDICT OR PREVENT WHEN THIS PROBLEM WILL OCCUR.
