        "summary": "I have a 2021 Chevy Traverse LT. The stereo touch screen keeps completely freezing. We've brought it to the dealer who told us it was working fine. Its frozen twice. Once we had to pull the fuse out to reset it for it to work. Vehicle has a rattle at startup and suspension squeaks. Captain seats almost seem loose, they rattle at times. The brakes are horrible, they squeak all the time. Pads are not worn, but it appears from my mechanical knowledge that the pads are slightly oversized to the rotor or not set on straight and they're rubbing the unmachined part of the rotor which could contribute to the brake issue. Dealers have claimed before its just ceramic rub, however; I have done tons of brake jobs and ALWAYS use ceramics. NEVER had a problem with that. Vehicles need a MAJOR recall for all these systems as they can all be a major safety concern. Brakes not set on right or pads to big can cause the pads to break off causing loss of braking power and an accident. Seats not tightened properly can cause death or serious injury to passengers in an accident. Failing suspension can cause loss of control of the vehicle and an accident, freezing touch screen can cause an accident if the driver is using the Nav system and it stops.",
