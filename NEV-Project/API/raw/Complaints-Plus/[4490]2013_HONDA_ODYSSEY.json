I was pulling into the first parking space close to the PE field, with a fully turned steering wheel, as in doing a U turn. Since I was going slow my right foot was lightly pressing the brake. My minivan was in the parking spot and I was creeping closer to the concrete parking stop with my right foot pressing more down on the brake so I can come to a complete stop. I was about to place the car in park when the engine revved, the car jerked, it accelerated sending me up and over the curb and into the grassy median in front of the parking space and into a tree. The coaches and one other person came running to assist me since I was in shock.  There was smoke coming out of the engine so I placed the minivan in park and shut the engine off.

I DID CALL AND RAISE A TICKET W/ HONDA OF AMERICA, LETTING THEM KNOW ALL THAT HAD OCCURRED AND OFFERED THEM THE VIDEO AS WELL, ALSO DISCUSSED WITH THE HONDA REP.
