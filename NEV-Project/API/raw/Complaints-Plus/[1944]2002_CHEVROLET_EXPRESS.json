I DON'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST TO HELP ME AS I HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF SO BAD NOW. CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME OR ADVISE ME WHERE I CAN HAVE THIS VEHICLE COMPLETELY CHECKED OUT. THE SERVICE TECH SAID IT WAS A MIRACLE THAT THE DRIVE SHAFT DID NOT FALL OUT ON THE TRIP MYSELF AND GRANDCHILDREN WERE ON. IT BROKE DOWN IN OHIO AND I LIVE IN OKLAHOMA SO OF COURSE IT SET ME BACK A LOT OF EXPENSE I COULD NOT AFFORD. I THOUGHT THE DEALERSHIP SHOULD STAND BEHIND THE 60 DAY WARRANTY SINCE I HAD TAKEN IT BACK TO THEM WITHIN THE WARRANTY TIME, BUT THEY HAVE GIVEN ME NOTHING BUT GRIEVE. I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HELP I CAN GET AS I AM AFRAID OF THE VAN NOW.  *JB",

MY WIFE WAS DRIVING TO WORK AND NEEDED TO ACCELERATE TO MERGE ONTO THE FREEWAY AND INSTANTLY THE TRANSMISSION BEGAN TO WHINE AND STOPPED OPERATING WHICH PLACED HER INTO THE PATH OF A LARGE TRUCK BEARING DOWN ON HER RATHER QUICKLY. THANKFULLY SHE WAS ABLE TO GLIDE OUT OF THE PATH OF THE TRUCK TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. WE HAD THE TAHOE TOWED BACK TO OUR DEALERSHIP AND WE DETERMINED THAT THE TRANSMISSION \"SUN SHELL\" HAD FAILED AND WOULD BE REPLACED. OUR DEALER ASSURED US THAT THIS WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM, BECAUSE THE NEW PARTS WERE DESIGNED TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE. OUR DEALER FURTHER STATED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN REPAIRING A LARGE NUMBER OF VEHICLES WITH THESE FAILURES.
