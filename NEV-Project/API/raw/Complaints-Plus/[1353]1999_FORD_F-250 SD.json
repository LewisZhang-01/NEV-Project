I JUST WAS LAID OFF FROM MY JOB BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMY, I NOW ONLY HAVE MY WIFE'S CAR FOR TRANSPORTATION, AND GET A BILL FOR 2700 BUCKS? THIS CAR HAS PUT MYSELF AND MY 10 YEAR OLD SON IN DANGER BECAUSE OF A KNOWN ENGINE PROBLEM WITH FORD TRUCKS! NOT ONLY THAT BUT I HAD TO REPLACE MY SONS BASEBALL GLOVE FROM TRYING TO SNUFF OUT THE FIRE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE ISN'T SOME KIND OF SAFETY RECALL ON THESE VEHICLES. I HOPE YOU GUYS CAN LOOK INTO THIS BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED OR BURNED TO DEATH! *TR",

I TOOK THE TRUCK TO A LOCAL GLASS REPAIR SHOP, BINSWANGER, IN FORT WORTH. THE REPAIR TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH FORD F250'S THAT HE HAS SEEN MANY TIMES AND THAT IT WAS MORE THAN JUST A LEAK. HE SAID THAT THE WINDSHIELD WAS NEVER SECURED PROPERLY FROM THE FACTORY AND MAY COME OFF THE TRUCK. THE TECHNICIAN EXPLAINED THAT THE ADHESIVE WAS BONDED TO THE WINDSHIELD AND THE PAINT BUT THAT THE PAINT CAME LOOSE FROM THE METAL AROUND THE WINDSHIELD. SO, IT APPEARS THAT I AM SIMPLY FORTUNATE THAT NOTHING CATASTROPHIC HAPPENED OVER THE LAST 9 YEARS WHILE I HAVE BEEN DRIVING THE TRUCK. I WOULD LIKE FORD TO FIX THE PROBLEM. *TR",

I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS PROBLEM,  AND THE CPS WAS THE KNOWN CAUSE. I HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE SINCE IT WAS NEW. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE FROM FORD, AND HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO LOCATE A RECALL ON THEIR POWER STROKE WEBSITE. ACCORDING TO THE MANY WEBSITES DEALING WITH THE POWER STROKE DIESEL, BOTH THE 7.3 AND THE 6.0 LTR MODELS, THIS PROBLEM WAS CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE MARKETPLACE. I AM REPORTING THIS BECAUSE THE PROBLEM WAS DANGEROUS AND ACCORDING TO FORD'S SAME POWER STROKE WEBSITE - WWW.POWERSTROKEDIESEL.COM \"SINCE 1994 OVER 2,000,000 POWER STROKE ' DIESEL EQUIPPED FORD TRUCKS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED '' AND AN ASTONISHING 98.5%* ARE STILL ON THE ROAD!\" AS OF TODAY'S DATE.  CAN  NHTSA TELL ME IF THIS PROBLEM HAS BEN IDENTIFIED PREVIOUSLY, AND WHETHER OR NOT RECALL RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE?*AK",
