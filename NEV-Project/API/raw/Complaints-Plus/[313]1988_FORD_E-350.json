        "summary": "I PURCHASED THIS 28' SHASTA CLASS C MOTORHOME FROM A PRIVATE PARTY. ALL RECEIPTS FROM WORK HISTORY WERE INCLUDED. UPON THE FIRST TIME OUT, TOWING MY 1200 LB BOAT TO LAKE MEAD ( NO SIGNIFICANT HILLS AS I LIVE IN LAS VEGAS ), THE MOTORHOME RAN BEAUTIFUL, EVEN UP TO THE POINT OF PARKING. I CAME OUT TWO DAYS LATER TO START IT WHEN I NOTICED THE BATTERY AS DRAINED. UPON LOOKING UNDER THE HOOD, I NOTICED IT HAD CAUGHT ON FIRE, BURNING 2 INJECTORS AND OTHER WIRING LOCATED IN THE SAME VICINITY. I REPLACED INJECTORS, RELAYS, FUEL PUMP, ALL HOSES, COIL, ETC... THE BEST GUESS IS THE DIVERTER FROM THERMACTOR MAY HAVE CAUSED, BUT REGARDLESS THIS WAS A FACTORY ISSUE. IT STILL DOESN'T RUN, GOING TO REPLACE ECM, INERTIA SW, ETC UNTIL IT DOES. JUST GRATEFUL IT DIDN'T BURN UP EVERYTHING.  *TR",
