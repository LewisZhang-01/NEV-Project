Prior to that, I had a mechanic look at it in case the oil change place made a mistake on their end and found they were not at fault. So after the Hyundai dealership told me there was 2 recalls that she can see from her end based on my VIN, 1 for the engine and the other for the trunk, we set up an appointment to try and repair the vehicle because at this point the vehicle was not drivable and we had to get it towed. We also had no prior knowledge that there was any recall due to the fact we bought the vehicle in May of 2020 from a dealership called Toyota of Lincoln Park. After bringing in paperwork to Hyundai in person for proof we have been maintaining the car and after waiting weeks for our car to be fixed, we are being told they cannot fix the engine due to the fact that the recall was from 2018 and the previous owners did nothing to resolve the issue. We were also told that the dealership that sold us the vehicle cannot look up recalls from other vehicles and only can do it with Toyota. The car had already almost failed on the expressway and could have caused an accident had we not pulled off to the exit. And we were fortunate enough to get it to our home. The engine wasn't locked up and we feel now it might be while in the hands of Hyundai. Hyundai has denied the claim to have it serviced due to it being a 2018 recall and all we want is the car running again.

The engine light is consistently illuminated, the oil light comes on within about a few weeks of having the oil changed with just local neighborhood driving and I have to have my oil changed every 4-6 weeks when even just driving no more than 20-30 miles a week, the mechanic who does my oil changes stated there is no oil leak but the oil stick keeps coming up BONE DRY which results in costly oil changes on a extremely regular basis. The engine has been and continues to do a very hard almost violent knocking that is so strong it can be seen from the outside of the vehicle and has affected the way i have to drive the car. The engine hesitates to take off and according to several mechanics who have looked at the vehicle it keeps misfiring because of oil pooling in the spark plugs that has been changed on a regular monthly basis now. There is a large amount of smoke that pours from the exhaust when accelerating. This vehicle is a hazard to drive and contacting Hyundai although this model and year is included in the engine recall, yields nothing but a pain as they have informed me, that my \u201cVin\u201d out of all of the other 2017 Hyundai Sonata\u2019s isn\u2019t included in the nationwide recall of my particular vehicle\u2026. Just my luck?

We pulled over into a dirt parking lot, noticed a puddle of oil underneath the car, and then lifted the hood to see oil sprayed all over the engine compartment. I had the vehicle towed to an independent mechanic where the vehicle was diagnosed with engine failure. The vehicle was then towed to a dealer where it remains in their possession as of today which in my opinion is too long to wait without a car, 6 months later from the incident. The manufacturer was notified of the failure June 16th and they informed me that the vehicle did not qualify for any recalls or warranty programs. The vehicle VIN later showed up on the recall campaign in September. Hyundai USA offered to replace the engine at no cost which I am thankful for that so far. However, after the engine replacement, I was told the car would not start, and will require a new battery module and hybrid battery, and that I must pay 40% of the parts and labor at $2776. I believe these parts suddenly failing are directly related to the engine failure incident, and should be part of the recall campaign. My car has yet to be repaired due to backordered parts. I've submitted rental car fee receipts of over $3500 to date without reimbursement because I'm told that it is their policy to only review rental receipts for reimbursement after the repair ticket is closed, with no possibility of interim reimbursement. The Hyundai case manager has told me there is nothing more that they can do, not willing to discuss with another department or Manager, no escalation path forward, and that all I can do is file this complaint with the NHTSA per the recall campaign notification.",

Because we are checking and replacing the missing oil at the early timeframes of 1000 miles instead of at 7500 miles, no one is in immediate danger (beyond my bank account).   The service center has been monitoring the issue for some time. They checked seals, gaskets, and replaced them to be sure they were not the issue. The oil levels still decrease.  Upon speaking to a Hyundai rep, he (the manufacturer) claims there is no issue but I should get a diagnostic check up at dealer. I am scheduling one this week. Issues with the local dealer is they charge too much, suggest repairs that are not necessary, and have extended service wait times of at least 3 hours even though I have an appointment.  There have been no warning lamps, messages, or actual failures. I am trying to prevent reaching that stage. I do know that my engine is the same one they recalled from earlier models. Those engines were having high oil consumption issues which help lead to more serious safety issues with time.

While this is occurring I experience dangerous and excessive lane travel. I hear a faint crack coming from the steering column at about the 6:00 position and then it feels like the steering wheel is loosening up again. It seems this problem is worsening and happening more frequent as time goes on. I have had the vehicle to the Hyundai dealership to be looked at and they stated that they could find nothing wrong. This occurs both on the highway and while driving around town at all speeds. I have searched the internet for recalls associated with this problem, but no recall, but a lot of complaints on line from other Hyundai vehicle owners experiencing this same issue.

THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, AND COULD BE DEADLY. IT'S UNACCEPTABLE THAT A RECALL HAS NOT BEEN ISSUED. I CALLED HYUNDAI CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND WAS ADVISED THAT SINCE THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY MY ONLY OPTION IS TO BRING IT TO THE DEALER AND PAY FOR AN INSPECTION AND REPAIRS MYSELF. THIS IS A MANUFACTURES SAFETY ISSUE, AND IT NEEDS A RECALL. I CALLED THE DEALER AND WAS ADVISED THAT I CAN BRING THE CAR IN AND PAY FOR AN INSPECTION, BUT THEY WOULD PROBABLY NEED TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. WHY HAS NOTHING BEEN DONE ABOUT THIS??

I NEVER BOTHERED TO CHECK THE OIL BECAUSE I HAD COMPLETE CONFIDENCE THAT THE OIL WAS TOPPED OFF AT EVERY OIL CHANGE. HOWEVER, I STARTED NOTICING THAT THE CAR FELT FORCED WHENEVER I TRIED TO ACCELERATE. I ALSO STARTED NOTICING A SUBTLE RATTLING NOISE COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD WHENEVER I WOULD TRY TO ACCELERATE. I HAD A MECHANIC CHECK MY CAR IN JANUARY 2021 WHEN HE CHECKED THE OIL LEVELS AND POINTED OUT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE DIPSTICK. WHAT IS EVEN STRANGER IS THAT NO DASHBOARD LIGHT HAD COME ON. I HAD DRIVEN THE CAR APPROXIMATELY 2,500 SINCE THE THE OIL CHANGE IN DECEMBER AND IT WAS ALREADY EMPTY. I CHECKED UNDER THE CAR WHERE I PARK BOTH AT HOME AND AT WORK AND THERE ARE NO OIL SPILLS ON THE GROUND. I'VE READ SEVERAL FORUMS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME ISSUE WITH OLDER MODELS OF THIS CAR AND THERE ARE RECALLS FOR THOSE MODELS.

FOR THE SECOND TIME IN 10 MONTHS, I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALER - THIS TIME THEY ARE REPLACING THE STEERING COLUMN AND THE POWER STEERING UNIT.  I THOUGHT THAT I HAD SIMPLY BOUGHT A \"LEMON\" - I HAD TO HAVE THE TRANSMISSION REPLACED LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR BUT AFTER LOOKING UP MY MAKE AND MODEL ON CARCOMPLAINTS.COM I REALIZED THAT MANY OTHER SONATAS BESIDES MINE HAVE LOST POWER STEERING, MANY OF THEM WHILE DRIVING (SOME AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS).  BESIDES BRAKES, STEERING IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST SAFETY ISSUE ON ANY CAR.  HYUNDAI HAS A REALLY GOOD WARRANTY AND I BOUGHT A MORE COMPREHENSIVE WARRANTY SO MY REPAIRS SHOULD NOT COST ME ANYTHING BUT THE FACT REMAINS, THIS MODEL SONATA HAS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY DEFECT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY HYUNDAI BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED, IF IT HAS NOT HAPPENED ALREADY.  I FEEL FORTUNATE THAT MY POWER STEERING NEVER WENT OUT WHILE I WAS DRIVING THE CAR LIKE MANY OTHERS DID.  *TR",

WHEN I REPORTED IT TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY SAID I MUST HAVE TAKEN IT THROUGH A CAR WASH. I HAVE HAD 3 SONATAS AND HAVE NEVER TAKEN ONE THROUGH A CAR WASH. WHEN I FIRST GOT TO THE DEALERSHIP THE RECEPTIONIST AT THE SERVICE DEPT. SAID THEY HAD BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THAT PART, BUT THE SERVICE MANAGER TRIED DENYING IT. I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO OTHER SONATA OWNERS AND SOME HAVE EXPERIENCE A SIMILAR PROBLEM.WHEN I REPORTED IT TO HYUNDAI THEY FAILED TO TAKE ACTION. THE PHOTOS WILL SHOW THAT THE VERY SMALL SCREWS IN THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENT THAT ATTACH TO THE PLASTIC SHARK FIN COVER HAVE VERY LITTLE PENETRATION INTO THE SHARK FIN COVER. INCIDENT HAPPENED ON MAY 9, 2019, REPORTED IT ON MAY 10.  I ENDED UP PAYING $353.03 FOR THE PART AND INSTALLATION. I AM SUGGESTING THAT THE WIND AT 75 MPH LIFTED THE PLASTIC COVER BECAUSE IT SOUNDED LIKE A RIPPING SOUND LIKE ONE SCREW AT A TIME. NOT ONLY DID IT CAUSE ME TO TAKE MY EYES OF THE ROAD, BUT THE PART FLYING BACK COULD HAVE POSED A SERIOUS SAFETY TO ANOTHER DRIVER DRIVING BEHIND ME.

WHEN I REPORTED THIS TO HYUNDAI THEY INVESTIGATED AND DETERMINED THAT THE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED PROPERLY AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT THE LOGO TO BE SHOT FROM THE STEERING WHEEL ALONG WITH THE AIRBAG.  HOWEVER, I ALSO OWN A 2011 HYUNDAI AND THE STEERING WHEEL DOES NOT HAVE A SEPARATE LOGO BUT AN IMPRINTED \"H\".  I DON'T THINK THAT WHEN AN AIRBAG DEPLOYS IT SHOULD SHOOT ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE AIRBAG.  THE LOGO HIT MY ARM BUT IF IT HIT MY EYE I WOULD HAVE LOST MY EYE.  IF IT HIT MY THROAT IT COULD HAVE COLLAPSED MY AIRWAY.   AIRBAGS ARE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT YOU AND NOT CAUSE INJURY.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I SHOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED THAT THIS PIECE WOULD BECOME A PROJECTILE IN AN ACCIDENT, OR WHY ITS ACCEPTABLE.",

FINALLY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM TO BE A MISSING CIRCLIP (\"C\" CLIP) THAT HOLDS THE CV AXLE IN THE TRANSMISSION CASE. WITHOUT IT, THE AXLE ITSELF WAS WORKING ITS WAY OUT OF THE TRANSMISSION CASE, AND VIBRATING BECAUSE OF ITS LOOSENESS. RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM AND FOUND THAT FULL SEPARATION OF THE AXLE FROM THE TRANSMISSION COULD RESULT IN UNCONTROLLED BEHAVIOR OF CAR, AND INEVITABLE ACCIDENT OR WORSE. THIS WAS A MANUFACTURING/ASSEMBLY ERROR, AND COULD BE A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM IN THE ASSEMBLY PROCESS. THE REPAIR WAS PERFORMED BY THE DEALERSHIP UNDER WARRANTY, BUT THIS COULD PRESENT A DANGEROUS RISK TO OTHER 2017 SONATA PURCHASERS, SO I WRITE THIS COMPLAINT AS BOTH A CIVIC RIGHT AND A RESPONSIBLE CITIZEN.  WHEN DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE WITH A HYUNDAI REPRESENTATIVE, I WAS TOLD IN BLUNT AND NO UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT THE PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED AND THERE WAS NO FURTHER ACTION OR DISCUSSION THAT WAS NECESSARY.

HOWEVER MY CAR HIT THE SPARE TIRE AND RACK ON THE BACK OF HER TRUNK, CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE HOOD OF MY CAR, THE GRILL AND LOWER BUMPER. WE DID NOT EXCHANGE INFORMATION, AS SHE DID NOT HAVE DAMAGE TO HER CAR, SO SHE LEFT THE SCENE. I DROVE THE CAR HOME (2 MILES FROM MY HOUSE) AND CALLED THE DEALERSHIP. THEY TOLD ME TO BRING THE CAR IN. I BROUGHT IT IN THE SAME DAY. RAYMOND, THE SERVICE AGENT CAME OUTSIDE TO SURVEY THE DAMAGE AND I TOLD HIM WHAT HAPPENED. HE WENT TO TALK TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AND LATER CAME OUT AND SAID THEY WILL TAKE THE CAR AND PUT IT ON THE MACHINE TO GET A DIAGNOSTIC READING TO SEE WHY THE CAR STALLED. THEY GAVE ME A LOANER CAR AND I LEFT. ON MONDAY, 9/19/17, I RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP AFTER I GOT OFF WORK AND WAS TOLD BY RAYMOND THAT THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG THUS FAR. HE SAID HE WANTED TO KEEP THE CAR ANOTHER DAY OR TWO TO TAKE IT FOR A DRIVE AND TRY TO SEE IF IT WOULD STALL AGAIN. I AGREED AND ASKED RAYMOND TO ALSO CHECK THE FUEL INJECTORS, FUEL PUMP, FUEL REGULATOR, AS MY FRIEND WHO IS A CAR MECHANIC SUGGESTED TO ME THAT THIS CAN CAUSE A CAR TO STALL ALSO.  HE SAID OKAY. ON TODAY, WEDNESDAY 9/21/17, RAYMOND CALLED ME AND SAID THEY TOOK THE CAR OUT FOR A DRIVE AND IT DID NOT STALL, NOR COULD THEY GET A READING THAT ANYTHING WAS WRONG WHEN THEY PUT IT ON THE MACHINE. HE SAID HE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE CAR WOULD STALL. I ASKED FOR A DIAGNOSTIC REPORT AND HE SAID HE COULD ONLY GIVE ME A COPY OF THE SERVICE TICKET. I AM AFRAID THAT THIS CAR COULD STALL AGAIN AND WHAT IF IT HAPPENS WHILE DRIVING -- IT COULD BE MUCH WORST DAMAGE AND BODILY HARM. PLEASE HELP!",

        "summary": "FIRST EXTENDED DRIVE OF NEW CAR, CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  TOOK IT TO DEALER FOR SERVICE, WAS TOLD I HAD \"BAD FUEL\" THAT THEY TESTED A SAMPLE AND FOUND E85 (ETHANOL) IN IT, WHICH IS NOT COVERED BY HYUNDAI NEW CAR WARRANTY FOR PLUG-IN HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES.  I PAID $828 TO HAVE FUEL DRAINED AND REPLACED, FUEL INJECTION CLEANING, AND DECARBONIZING AND THROTTLE BODY CLEANING.  CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WENT AWAY, BUT TURNED BACK ON A FEW DAYS LATER.  AGAIN TOOK IT TO DEALER BUT THEY WERE UNABLE TO GET IT TO TURN ON AFTER I LEFT IT, SO RETURNED THE CAR TO ME, NO CHARGE.  I HAD ONLY ADDED 87 OCTANE GASOLINE (PER OWNER'S MANUAL RECOMMENDATION) TO MY CAR 3 TIMES PRIOR TO THE FIRST CHECK ENGINE LIGHT EPISODE, AT STATIONS THAT DID NOT SELL E85.  DURING SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATION WITH HYUNDAI REP, WAS TOLD MAYBE WATER WAS IN GAS.  BUT ENGINE RAN FINE AND I DROVE 100 MILES AFTER LAST GAS FILLUP SO I SUSPECT THERE MAY BE A PROBLEM WITH THE EMISSIONS SENSOR THAT MANIFESTS AS CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WITH RANDOM (INACCURATE) DIAGNOSTIC CODE.  I GOT THIS CAR IN CHICAGO, BUT ILLINOIS IS NOT A LOW EMISSIONS VEHICLE STATE, SO THE PLUG-IN HYBRID IS NOT ALLOCATED TO HYUNDAI DEALERS IN ILLINOIS.  THE SONATA HYBRID, HOWEVER, IS SOLD HERE BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT SHARES THE SAME ENGINE/EMISSIONS SENSING SYSTEM AS MY PLUG-IN HYBRID ELECTRIC.  DEALER SERVICE DID CHECK FOR OBVIOUS THINGS:  GAS CAP, RESETTING THE ENGINE DIAGNOSTIC CHIP.  I UNDERSTAND THE 2016 MODEL PHEV IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS MY 2017 MODEL, IN CASE SIMILAR CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ISSUE HAPPENED WITH 2016 CARS.",

HALFWAY THROUGH THE TURN AT A FEW MILES AN HOUR MY ENGINE LIGHT AND TRACTION CONTROL LIGHTS CAME ON. AT THE SAME TIME THE ENGINE BEGAN TO REV TO ABOUT 4500 RPM. IT DIED DOWN QUICKLY. I THEN HAD NO RESPONSE FROM THE ACCELERATOR. LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AS I HAD JUST ENTERED A TOWN. I TURNED OFF THE CAR AND ATTEMPTED TO RESTART IT. IT WOULD NOT RESTART UNTIL ABOUT 15 MINUTES LATER. THE SHIFTER BECAME LOCKED IN THE PARKING POSITION AND EVEN AFTER USING THE SHIFT RELEASE BUTTON I WAS STILL UNABLE TO MOVE THE VEHICLE. LUCKILY AGAIN I HAD JUST ENTERED A TOWN BUT A FEW MILES BEFORE THAT I WAS ON COUNTRY ROADS WHERE THERE WAS NO CELL PHONE SIGNAL AT ALL. I WOULD HAVE BEEN OUT OF LUCK AS WELL AS THE PASSENGER WITH ME. AFTER AN HOUR AND A HALF OF WAITING THE TOW VEHICLE CAME AND WAS ABLE TO GET IT HOME AND THEN ONCE AGAIN TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP I HAD BOUGHT IT FROM. IT HAS NOW BEEN SITTING THERE FOR 5 DAYS AND HAVE BEEN TOLD REPEATEDLY NOW THAT NO ONE UNDERSTANDS WHAT IS WRONG AND HAVE HAD TO GET A SPECIALIST TO COME IN TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. THIS IS A CAR THAT I HAVE ONLY OWNED FOR 3 WEEKS AND BOUGHT OUTRIGHT WITH ONLY 44 MILES ON IT. IT NOW HAS MAYBE 350.  *TR",

IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP THE CAR DRIVING STRAIGHT. IT'S MORE APPARENT AT SPEEDS OVER 50MPH. AT 70MPH YOU MUST PAY 100% ATTENTION TO THE STEERING WHEEL AND CONTINUE TO WORK IT LIKE A MAD MAN; OTHERWISE YOU'LL END UP IN THE DITCH IN SECONDS.    IT'S A HIGH SEVERITY SAFETY DEFECT THAT NEEDS IMMEDIATE, NATIONWIDE RECALL. IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING SONATA 2017', LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES AND BUY SOMETHING ELSE. DO NOT RISK YOUR LIFE AND LIFE OF YOUR FAMILY IN THIS PIECE OF KOREAN GARBAGE.        YES, I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER ( GERALD HYUNDAI NORTH AURORA, ILLINOIS ).   IN SHORT, I HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE ISSUE I'M HAVING ON THE HIGHWAY, THE TECHNICIAN SAW IT AND FELT THE CAR PULLING, HE SAW THE CAR WANDER FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND HE SAW THAT I HAD TO CORRECT THE DIRECTION CAR IS DRIVING EVERY FEW SECONDS. LATER WE SWAPPED PLACES, HE DROVE THE CAR AND GAVE ME FEEDBACK     \" IT'S OK, THAT'S HOW SONATAS DRIVE. YOU EITHER LOVE IT OR HATE IT. TRY SPORT MODE, THE STEERING WHEEL IS STIFFER, I LIKE IT BETTER, THE CAR IS NOT PULLING THAT MUCH IN SPORT MODE\"    AFTER RETURNING TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT, I'VE WAS ( AS EXPECTED ) TOLD THAT THE ISSUE CANNOT BE DUPLICATED AND CAR IS OPERATING AS IT WAS DESIGNED. ---- BASICALLY GTFO MR. CUSTOMER! ----      IF YOU ARE SMART, JUST DISMISS THE IDEA OF BUYING HYUNDAI SONATA 2017 SE MODEL ( NOT SURE ABOUT SPORT OR LIMITED ).     OTHER THAN LIFE THREATING DEFECT WITH STEERING, I LOVE EVERYTHING ELSE IN THIS CAR. STILL, I'M TAKING A HUGE FINANCIAL HIT TO TRADE IT IN BEFORE I MAKE THE FIRST PAYMENT. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT AND MY LIFE AND HEALTH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN FEW GRAND. I DON'T WANT TO WASTE TIME TO KEEP PLAYING GAMES WITH DEALERSHIPS AND KEEP MYSELF STRESSED.",
