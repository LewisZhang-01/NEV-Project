The problem is on dozens of Toyota forums and I have also consulted with two different dealerships that have verified this. The 4 cylinder engines in the Tacoma have already been recalled for this issue but they are offering no reimbursement or recall on the 6 cylinder engines. The engine begins leaking oil early in it its life as mine has been. An engine should not fail at 20k 30k or 80k miles due to a factory defect. Toyota should be offering a fix for this issue as it will significantly cut the life of rhe engine. This can cause engine fire and various other safety issues in these trucks if enough engine oil leaks down into a hot engine.",

A few months after purchasing my Tacoma in 2016 Toyota (no accidents to date & 95% highway driving)  and one outside alignment shop had never been able to get the truck aligned properly so it would never keep its alignment more than 3-4 months; repeated visits to Toyota maintence for alignment over the years became as routine as an oil change, sometimes more frequently; the unaligned suspension constantly was causing unsafe handling and unintentional swerving. 2. Toyota missed, and maybe purposefully, identifying major engine, transfer case, and transmission leaks during regular and routine serivces (always serviced at Toyota dealerships) until my mileage exceeded 60,000 miles. Then when I asked the dealership to recheck a recent transfer case refresh because I saw leaks, I needed and got over $3,000 in repairs e.g. power steering pump, front and rear seals, differential gasket-- it was terrible. Toyota did give a good will reimbursment of $1,400. 3. Now ~6 months later and still under 80,000 miles, I just spent $4,100 for repairs on more engine leaks; Toyota will not tell me if my vehicle is safe to drive, tells me the truck is ourside its warranty period (as it was last year), and refuses any goodwill adjustment.

THERE ARE THREE ISSUES HERE: 1) A CLEAR DESIGN FLAW, 2) THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, IT COULD HAVE CAUSED A FIRE, AND 3)  IT LIKELY AFFECTS THE ENTIRE FLEET OF TACOMAS IN THIS YEAR RANGE.     MY BELIEF IS THAT THIS RISES TO THE LEVEL OF A RECALL AND HAVE TALKED TO BOTH THE DEALER AND CORPORATE ABOUT IT. TOYOTA HAS AGREED TO PAY HALF THE COST OF REPAIRS, AND I HAVE AGREED TO THIS, (ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO CLAIM TO HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS PROBLEM BEFORE).     TOYOTA CASE #: 2103011304",

AFTER THE SEAL WAS REPLACED THE DEALER SAID THAT, UPON FURTHER INSPECTION THEY FOUND MOLD, AND IT WAS THE WORST THEY HAD EVER SEEN. THEY TOOK EVERYTHING OUT OF THE CAB AND THEY HAVE TO SCRAPE ALL OF THE SOUND DEADENING MATERIAL OFF THE FLOORBOARD WHERE THE MOLD HAS CONCENTRATED. THEY WILL THEN HAVE TO HAVE AN OUTSIDE COMPANY COME IN AND TREAT THE VEHICLE FOR THE MOLD ISSUE. THEN THEY WILL HAVE TO ORDER REPLACEMENT PARTS AFFECTED. I WAS ADVISED THIS MORNING IT WILL BE ANOTHER 2-3 WEEKS BEFORE THE REPAIRS ARE COMPLETE. THANK GOD I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE WITH A CERTIFIED WARRANTY. OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE BEEN SCREWED.

THE DEALER IS AWARE THAT THIS MODEL TRUCK HAS BEEN RECALLED FOR REAR DIFFERENTIAL FAILURE AND MISFIRING AND STALLING.    WHILE DRIVING EAST ON FM1097 BETWEEN LAKE CONROE AND WILLIS, TX ON 2/06/18, I WAS REQUIRED TO MAKE A QUICK STOP.  A LOUD BUMP SOUND CAME FROM BENEATH THE TRUCK.  PRIOR TO THIS STOP, THE ENGINE HAD BEEN MISFIRING FROM-TIME-TO-TIME.  AFTER THE QUICK STOP AND THE BUMP SOUND CAME FROM BENEATH THE TRUCK, THE ENGINE STARTED MISFIRING AT A CONSTANT AND VIOLENT RATE FOR A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 1 MILE.  MY TRUCK HAS BEEN MAKING AN UNUSUAL BUMP SOUND WHICH OCCURS SHORTLY AFTER COMING TO A STOP SINCE I BOUGHT IT IN 2016.  THE TRUCK HAS ALSO BEEN MISFIRING FOR AS LONG AS I HAVE OWNED IT.  I AM AFRAID THAT THE BUMP MAY BE DUE TO LOOSE OR BROKEN MOTOR OR TRANSMISSION MOUNTS, LOOSE SUSPENSION BOLTS OR THE GAS TANK MAY BE SHIFTING.  THE MISFIRE MAY INDICATE THAT A FUEL LINE IS BEING RESTRICTED WHEN THE GAS TANK SHIFTS POSITION.  A PINCHED OR DEFORMED GAS LINE MAY BE STARVING THE FUEL PUMP AND CAUSING THE ENGINE TO MISFIRE.  SINCE THE BUMP SOUND IS DELAYED AND OCCURS AFTER COMING TO A STOP, IT SUGGEST TO ME THAT THE GAS TANK MAY BE THE CAUSE SINCE THE GASOLINE IN THE TANK IS IN MOTION AFTER THE TRUCK COMES TO A STOP. I NEED TOYOTA TO TAKE THIS DEFECTIVE TRUCK IN AND REPAIR IT FOR THIS AND ALL THE OTHER PROBLEMS I HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TO TOYOTA.  TOYOTA NEEDS TO PROVIDE ME WITH A LOANER TRUCK WHILE MY TRUCK IS BEING REPAIRED.  I HAVE LEFT MY TRUCK WITH TOYOTA 5 TIMES FOR THE MISFIRE AND TOYOTA HAS NOT EVERY PROVIDED ME WITH A LOANER VEHICLE.

THEY PERFORMED THE TOYOTA SPECIFIED RECALL BY CHECKING FOR LEAKS AND APPARENTLY FOUND NONE AND RE TIGHTENED THE FASTENERS. ON JUNE 27 I WAS CHECKING THE TACOMA PRIOR TO OUR LEAVING ON VACATION AND NOTICED SEEPAGE ON THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL IN 3 LOCATIONS. I EMAILED TOYOTA WITH MY CONCERN. I INFORMED THEM I WOULD BE TAKING MY TACOMA TO THE DEALER ON JUNE 28, 2017 TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT. I TOOK THE TACOMA ON JUNE 28, 2017 TO 2NDTOYOTA DEALER. I INFORMED THE SERVICE ADVISOR OF MY CONCERN WITH THE DIFFERENTIAL. THE MASTER TECH LOOKED AT IT. I FOLLOWED UP WITH TOYOTA CORPORATE BY PHONE INFORMED THEM OF MY CONCERNS AND WAS ADVISED TO SPEAK WITH THE SERVICE MGR. AND I DID. AFTER THE TECH HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE TACOMA I WAS ADVISED THAT I WOULD NEED TO HAVE THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL REPLACED. THE SERVICE MGR. TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD ORDER THE PARTS TO REPAIR MY TACOMA AND I COULD HAVE USE OF A TRUCK ON LOAN FROM THE DEALERSHIP UNTIL MY TACOMA COULD BE REPAIRED. I RETURNED FROM VACATION MY TRUCK WAS NOT REPAIRED WAS TOLD TOYOTA WAS HAVING SOME TYPE OF ISSUE BECAUSE 1ST DEALER HAD ALL READY PERFORMED THE RECALL. HOWEVER, THE TACOMA BEGIN LEAKING AND THE DIFFERENTIAL WAS MAKING A LOUD NOISE AFTER THE RECALL WAS PERFORMED INITIALLY. I AM CONFUSED AS IT STILL SHOULD BE A WARRANTY COVERED ISSUE EVEN IF ANOTHER DEALER HAD ALL READY DID A RECALL. THE SERVICE ADVISOR AGREED AND THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO GET THE TRUCK REPAIRED. IT IS MY CONTENTION THAT THE 1ST DEALER DID THE RECALL CORRECTLY AND THE DIFFERENTIAL FAILED BECAUSE OF SUBSTANDARD PARTS OR DESIGN AFTER THE FIRST RECALL WAS DONE. MY CONCERN IS THAT MY TACOMA IS POTENTIALLY A RISK OF CRASH AS NOTED IN THE OFFICIAL TOYOTA RECALL. MY VEHICLE HAS BEEN AT THE DEALER SINCE JUNE 28TH 2017 OR 15 DAYS AND COUNTING.",

THE FOLLOWING MORNING WHEN I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP TO RETRIEVE MY TRUCK I WAS TOLD THE TRUCKS REAR DIFF WAS LEAKING TERRIBLY AND WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE. I WAS TOLD THE FIX WOULD BE COMPLETE IN ONE TO TWO WEEKS AND WAS GIVEN A COROLLA AS A COMPARABLE LOANER VEHICLE. AFTER TWO WEEKS OF FALSE UPDATES FROM VARIOUS TECHS I EMAILED THE SERVICE MANAGER AND REQUESTED AN IMMEDIATE UPDATE ALONG WITH A TRULY COMPARABLE LOANER \"TRUCK\". I RECEIVED AN UPDATE OF \"PER TOYOTA THERE IS NO FIX AND NO TIME LINE AS TO WHEN A FIX WILL HAPPEN\". I WAS GIVEN A DODGE RAM RENTAL FROM ENTERPRISE AS AN UPGRADED LOANER VEHICLE. I HAVE CALLED THE NUMBER PROVIDED ON THE WEB-SITE 800.331.4331 AND THEY HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THERE IS STILL NO REPAIR AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHEN ONE WILL BE FORTHCOMING. I AM MAKING PAYMENTS AND PROVIDING INSURANCE ON A BRAND NEW VEHICLE I HAVE BARELY EVEN DRIVEN AND NOW RESIDES ON THE DEALER LOT.

THE DRIVER CANNOT CHANGE GEARS WITHOUT EXCESSIVE FORCE ON THE SHIFTER, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN DRIVING DYNAMICS WHILE THIS IS OCCURRING (E.G., LOSS OF VEHICLE SPEED, LOSS OF ENGINE REVS, LUGGING TRANSMISSION).  EXAMPLES INCLUDE DOWNSHIFTS FROM 5-6, 5-4, 4-3, AND 3-2 AS WELL AS UPSHIFTS THROUGH THOSE SAME GEARS. THIS PRESENTS A CRITICAL SAFETY CONCERN WHEN THE TRANSMISSION MALFUNCTIONS AND THE VEHICLE DOES NOT OPERATE AS INTENDED. IT PLACES THE DRIVER IN DANGEROUS AND POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING SITUATIONS, WHEREBY THE DRIVER IS TAKING ATTENTION AWAY FROM DRIVING IN ORDER TO APPLY SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON THE SHIFT LEVER IN ORDER TO GET THE TRANSMISSION UNSTUCK. MOREOVER, WHILE MANEUVERING THE VEHICLE THROUGH TRAFFIC OR INTERSECTIONS, THE DRIVER AND OTHERS ON THE ROAD BECOME VULNERABLE TO MAJOR ACCIDENTS CAUSED BY A MALFUNCTIONING TOYOTA TRANSMISSION AND THE INABILITY OF THE DRIVER TO SAFELY OPERATE THE VEHICLE.     I HAVE CONTACTED TOYOTA ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.  TOYOTA RELIED ON AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY DEALER TO PERFORM AN INADEQUATE INSPECTION OF A MALFUNCTIONING TRANSMISSION AND THEN PROCEEDED TO DENY ALL RESPONSIBILITY; EVEN GOING AS FAR AS TO MAKE THE ASSERTION THAT \"THE CUSTOMER CAN DRIVE THE VEHICLE AS NECESSARY\".  TOYOTA HAS DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO REVIEW OR INSPECT THE MALFUNCTIONING TRANSMISSION ONLY TO CONCLUDE IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE!",

'WHEN ACCELERATING FROM 1,000 THROUGH 3,000 RPMS, THE STEERING WHEEL AND GAS PEDAL EXHIBIT A RESONANT BUZZING VIBRATION.  THE VIBRATION IS POWERFUL AND WORST IN THE 2,100-2,500 RPM RANGE.

'WHEN TRAVELING FOR LONG DISTANCES ON THE HIGHWAY THROUGH HILLS OR MOUNTAINS, THE ENGINE OFTEN SETTLES IN THE 2,000-2,500 RANGE.
