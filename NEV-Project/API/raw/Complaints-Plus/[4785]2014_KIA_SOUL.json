        "summary": "A loud bang was heard while driving approx. 35 MPH on a clear day.  The vehicle lost all power, smoke started coming from the hood area and the cabin began to fill with smoke.  Driver pulled over, opened the hood and discovered the entire engine compartment in was engulfed in flames.  Passersby tried to extinguish the flame with fire extinguishers, but it kept reigniting.  The fire department arrived and put out the flames. This could have been life threatening if the driver did not get out of the vehicle. Amica Insurance's claims processors and an independent forensic investigator engaged by Amica Insurance have concluded the engine fire was the result of catastrophic engine failure.  The forensic investigator noticed an outward bump in the oil pan and indicated this was likely the result of a separation of crankshaft and or piston rod elements.  The investigator indicated he sees about 10 of these engine fires each month.  Kia's special unit that addresses their engine fire problem has been notified and are dragging their feet.  We have not heard anything from them after filing a claim on or about 3/22/2022. There were no warning signs prior to this catastrophic failure event.  Gauges and warning systems were all normal. The engine and the engine compartment are a complete loss.  Other damage occurred as the fire department worked to extinguish the fire.  The forensic investigator and Amica's claims processor have declared the car a total loss.",

The dealership made no mention of my bad engine noises on the service invoice or when he called me to come pick up the car that had \"passed\" the engine test and the ecu update. My faint engine noise is escalating greatly following the recall completion.  After speaking a second time with the service advisor at Kia, he did admit the noise was present and said it was not my fault but, no coverage was available for me. My car was already over the extended warrantee mileage cap back when I received the initial recall notice so it seems I was always to be out of any engine repair coverage by Kia. I have a nice car in which I have overspent effort and money maintaining the engine better than the manufactures recommendations and it is basically junk now due to the engine prematurely breaking down. It sits in the street and I am without my car and I am far from alone as a Kia Soul owner.  A car that is worth many thousands of dollars to me running is now worth only about $200. to the junk man. You can't find a good, affordable car to replace it with today.  My question is: Why would the 2.0 Kia Soul owners not have the same, unlimited mileage warrantee on their engines which the other Kia and Hyundia owner's engines have received for these defective engines?  I think it is criminal, literally stealing money from people by selling a defective item and not compensating the owners for that defect. this action also forces the customer to spend more money on another vehicle, way before the time it should be necessary to do so.   I could have easily put 50-75K more miles on this Kia Soul car if it were not for the bad engine.",

I was able to restart it, the knocking was very loud. I was a couple miles from home so I slowly drove it home stopping 3-4 times to allow it to cool. At home I checked the oil and all had drained out except what was still dripping out underneath. A mechanic friend added oil and started it, it still knocked loudly and he thought a rod and/or rod bearing were bad. I parked it not knowing what to do yet. A little over 2 months later I was notified of recall 20V750, SC200. This was during covid. Between end of Jan 2021 (when notified) and  Nov 2021, I had been quarantined 4 times and had lost my job so I couldn't afford to tow to the dealer. When I did, Nov 22,21 the dealer would not honor the recall because an update on the KSDS on the ECU was not done. The recall letter said they would do the update and repairs. I researched all letters from Kia to their dealers, other owners and NHTSA.  THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS or conditions regarding this. ALL information states the update will be done with recall repairs, there is no time limit given (other than an offer to recieve a free Visa with update that expired 11-15-21), and suggests to do it asap. Even letters to dealer had 2 Q&A letters, each had a question if there were any restrictions on owners, the answer is no on both letters. There are NO restrictions regarding the updated ECU, the warrenty, or condition of the car. Kia DOES give the dealers instructions for cars that are towed in, if stored, if they start, if they crank. Each of these INCLUDE updating the KSDS, again making the excuse I was given false. There was NO reason the update could not be done and my car repaired PER KIA'S instructions to dealers and recall owners.",

I first took it back to the Kia dealership in 2019 because of the check engine light and told them it was pulling a 420 code I knew that was a catalytic converter which had been recalled. After a few hours of having my car they told me that no repairs were needed so they marked the recall as complete. I had to continue to drive with a check engine light on for several months. I brought it back again because I needed it to be fixed in order to pass the state inspection for registration renewal . At that point they did put on a new catalytic converter. Ever since then it has been leaking or burning oil. I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s gone through so much oil but the oil light has stayed on more than it\u2019s turned off despite putting a quart in every couple of days . For the last month I\u2019ve been doing 2 quarts at a time. Two nights ago my engine light started flashing on the highway. My car was shaking violently. When I got to my destination my engine completely died and the car started rolling backwards in the street  as I went to put it in park. I have since towed my vehicle twice to different auto shops. Currently they\u2019re saying that it needs a new engine because of the oil problem and are quoting me $7800. I believe that this was part of the recall  and that I should\u2019ve received a new engine two years ago. Instead I have easily spent more than $1000 this year on oil alone. And I cannot afford an engine that is worth twice as much as the car itself. I am very lucky that I wasn\u2019t stranded on the interstate and even luckier that my car didn\u2019t catch on fire.

He was able to make it to a gas station where he checked all the fluids. He found there to be NO oil!! There was no indication light or warning! As a matter of fact, we had the oil changed about a month prior to the incident. We also had the car into the dealership for a recall about the knock sensor detection system, maybe 3 weeks before this happened. I'm very upset, Kia will not work with me because the car has a little over 100,000 miles. I just don't understand how the engine could have been bone dry with absolutely no indication of it. There were no oil puddles in the driveway, no smell of burning oil, and above all else NO warning lights!!! Nobody was hurt, but they absolutely could have been!",

In June 2020 at 108,151 miles a Kia dealer/servicer determined the catalytic converter was the issue and needed replacement. Kia refused to provide a new one, as it was just outside the 6 year/100,000 mile warranty. Now in September 2021 the car is having the same problems and a Kia dealer/servicer determined the catalytic converter needs to be replaced AGAIN. Kia refused to replace, as they only give a 1 year warranty on the new one they put in June 2020 (doesn\u2019t EPA require a 5 year warranty on new aftermarket catalytic converters?). Contacted Kia Consumer Affairs and have pending escalated claim for them to provide the catalytic converter this time. There is clearly something wrong with the engine that it is causing the catalytic converters to fail so soon.

I was told to call Kia corporate and Kia corporate office has advised me that there is nothing they can do to assist me. The associate at the Kia service center said I could drive the vehicle but after a while it would cause other damage to the engine. I questioned the service center manager about why would they tell me that the repair they made on the 14th fixed the issue. He informed me that they had no way of knowing what the issue was until the MIL light came on. I informed him that it is an issue that there was no warning lamp to advise of the first two parts I paid for that they said was the issue. Kia would not afford towing to service center.

I took it to a repair shop and was told it needed a valve replacement but it was only a matter of time before I would need to replace the engine. I did have the valve job done at great expense to me. However the engine light came on and despite having each of the problems fixed generated by the codes that came up, the engine light never went off. Now I understand there is an engine recall and the problems described are exactly what is wrong with my car e.g. engine light is on, check oil light flickering on, gasoline/fuel odor. I also had the catalytic converter replaced at my expense, only to find out there was a recall on that too. I need to have my engine replaced. This is a safety issue.

I promptly pulled over to the shoulder and shut off the vehicle. The vehicle was then towed to Rusty Wallace Kia of Knoxville. They had the car for three months before I received a phone call in September 2019.

Rusty Wallace Kia then replaced the engine without my written permission. They called to inform me of this about a month later. I did receive mail from Kia Consumer Affairs alerting me of the recall a few months later. I have since contacted Consumer Affairs and they let me know they would be contacting Rusty Wallace Kia of Knoxville to discuss getting the repair payed for so I can get my car back. I received an email just today (several months later) from the service manager, Allison Richard\u2019s, saying that I am responsible for the cost of the repairs. The recall paperwork in the mail states the engine will be replaced and the KDS software updated. As of today, Rusty Wallace Kia of Knoxville is refusing to release my car back to me (which is paid in full and I have the title in hand), and Allison also stated that consumer affairs said they wouldn\u2019t help.

We brought our car in on 2/24/21 for this important safety recall/product improvement campaign.  They performed the PI2002B ECU Update (sc200b logic update), inspected the engine for sc200ps bct and fuel line and oil pan inspection which all passed.  We expressed the check engine light was coming on when on the highway, the proposed fix was replacing Purge valve, spark plugs and air filter.  I replaced the air filter and purge valve myself and had my local mechanic replaced the spark plugs and one coil on 4/10/21.  Also note that the car has been consuming too much oil for the past year and started to get worse during this time - sometimes losing more than a quart a week and we just monitor the oil level and add when it is getting low and were hopeful that these repairs would help the oil consumption problem as well as the check engine light coming on.  After these fixes the car started having severe acceleration/loss of power issues while driving on the highway when reaching 65 mph and the check engine light would flash.  And then one time the check engine light started flashing and stayed on and I brought it to my local mechanic to diagnose.  He cleaned our fuel system to see if it improves our performance and while doing so confirmed that our car has a clogged catalytic converter and recommended that we bring the car back to the dealership for an oil consumption test to inquire further into our car issues and that the high oil consumption may have led to the clogged cat.  Before I brought the car back to the dealership I re-read the recall/safety campaign letters and realized that it appears what was happening was after the software update which updated the knock sensor detection system - the blinking check engine light was blinking and the",

I THEN, LET GO OF THE PEDAL AND TRIED TO PRESS IT AGAIN, EXCEPT THIS TIME, MY CAR ACCELERATED BUT THE CAR WAS SHAKING. MY ENGINE LIGHT WAS BLINKING AND THEN WHEN I GOT TO A POINT TO STOP, MY CAR SHUT OFF ON ME. IN BOTH SCENARIOS, I GOT MY OIL CHANGED RIGHT BEFORE THE ISSUES. IN JULY I DID THE OIL CHANGE AND THREE DAYS LATER MY CAR STALLED. IN AUGUST I GOT MY OIL CHANGED AND MY CAR STALLED TWO WEEKS LATER ON SEPT. 7TH. NOW MY ENTIRE ENGINE HAS TO BE REPLACED AND THAT COSTS OVER $8000! THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND I WILL NEVER BUY A KIA AGAIN. THEY WONT EVEN TELL ME HOW IT HAPPENED BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED.

IT LOOKS LIKE THE ONLY OPTION IS TO FORK OUT $8,000 OR TO THROW OUT THE CAR!

MY HUSBAND WHO WAS IN ANOTHER VEHICLE AHEAD OF US CHECKED EVERYTHING AND FOUND THE OIL WAS A LITTLE LOW BUT IT WASN'T TIME FOR AN OIL CHANGE IT HAD ONLY BEEN A LITTLE OVER 3000 MILES AND IT IS ALWAYS CHANGED BEFORE OR AT 5000 MILES. HE ADDED OIL BUT THE NOISE WAS STILL THERE. WE HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO OUR MECHANIC. THE MECHANIC DID AN INSPECTION AND HE HEARD THE NOISE COMING FROM CYLINDER #3 AND HE DID A COMPRESSION TEST AND IT LOST COMPRESSION. HIS DIAGNOSIS IS THAT THE ROD IN CYLINDER #3 HAS BROKE AND WE NEED A NEW MOTOR. AFTER GETTING A HOLD OF KIA THEY WANT US TO TAKE IT TO A KIA DEALER AND PAY TO HAVE IT DIAGNOSED BUT IT WILL COST US ALMOST $300 AND WE ALREADY PAID ONE CERTIFIED MECHANIC, FOR THAT WHICH WE DON'T HAVE. THE CAR WAS BOUGHT IN SEPTEMBER OF 2019 WITH A LITTLE OVER 90,000 MILES AND JUST HAD A LITTLE OVER 100,000 ON IT. THIS HAPPENED IN AUGUST OF 2020 AND THE VEHICLE IS JUST SITTING AS WE MAKE PAYMENTS ON SOMETHING WE CAN'T EVEN DRIVE. WE STILL OWE $7700 ON THE CAR AND A MOTOR WILL COST ALMOST THAT AMOUNT.

ONCE I PICKED UP MY CAR I CONTACTED THE KIA CORPORATE OFFICE AND SPOKE TO ANOTHER YOUNG LADY EXPLAINING TO HER THE SITUATION AND SHE WAS VERY RUDE UNPROFESSIONAL BECAUSE SHE TOLD ME THAT IT KIA ONLY MANUFACTURES THE CAR BUT THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHEN A PART SUCH AS A CATALYTIC CONVERTER MAY GO BAD IN A CAR AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO FOR ME. SHE THEN STATED THAT THE NEXT TIME I PURCHASE A CAR I SHOULD MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THE WARRANTY COVERAGE BEFORE I PURCHASE THE VEHICLE. NEEDLESS TO SAY MY CATALYTIC CONVERTER NEEDS REPAIRING. I ALSO HAD PROBLEMS WITH MY TIRES AND I EXPLAINED TO THE YOUNG LADY THIS AS WELL. I TOLD HER I JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DID NOT WANT TO HELP ME GET THESE SITUATIONS FIX BECAUSE MY CAR WAS FAIRLY NEW. WELL I DIDN'T GET HELP FROM HER. FAR AS MY TIRES AFTER GETTING THE CRANK SENSOR FIX I FOUND MYSELF BACK AT HOLLY KIA GETTING MY TIRES LOOKED AT BECAUSE THE AIR KEPT GOING OUT. ONE MORNING GOING TO WORK A YOUNG MAN STOPPED ME ON THE HIGHWAY TO TELL ME MY TIRE WAS FLAT I IMMEDIATELY BUT AIR IN THE TIRE AND WENT TO HOLLY KIA AND TOLD THE SAME PARTS SERVICE SUPERVISOR WHAT THE PROBLEM HE TOOK MY CAR IN AND HAD THE TECHNICIAN LOOK AT MY TIRES I ASKED HIM COULD HE HAVE THEM LOOK AT ALL THE TIRES BECAUSE I AM PUTTING AIR IN THE TIRES EVERY OTHER DAY. WELL IN JUNE MY SON HAD TO PURCHASE THAT SAME TIRE THAT THEY SAID WAS FIX AND TOLD ME ALL THE OTHER TIRES WERE GOOD. IN SEPTEMBER 2018 I HAD TO END UP PURCHASING THREE OTHER TIRES BECAUSE I WAS STILL EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH HAVING TO PUT AIR IN THE OTHER TIRES.

THE ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON WHEN IT WANTS TOO AND THEN THERE IS VERY LITTLE POWER IN 1, 2,AND 3RD GEARS THIS IS A MANUAL TRANS. I ALMOST GOT HIT  IN THE SIDE BECAUSE OF PULLING FROM A STOP SIGH AND WENT TO GO AND LOOKED DOWN LIGHT WAS ON AND CAR DID NOT WANT TO MOVE. ITS VERY HARD TO GET A STICK SHIFT CAR TO START OUT IN 4TH GEAR. KIA SAYS THEY WANT ME HAPPY BUT WILL NOT REPLACE THE CAR INSTEAD OFFERING FREE OIL CHANGES AND OTHER ITEMS BUT I WANT A SAFE CAR TO DRIVE NOT OTHER ITEMS.  *TR",

UPON INVESTIGATING WHY THIS HAPPENED I NOTICED THAT THE SEATBELT RETENTION WAS IMPROPERLY WORKING. AS YOU PULL IT OUT IT WILL NOT RETRACT BACK INTO THE SEAT AS DESIGNED. I WAS SCARED AND HYSTERICAL BECAUSE LORD FORBID IF THERE WAS A COLLISION MY CHILD COULD HAVE BEEN EJECTED FROM THE VEHICLE AND THROWN OUT THE FRONT WINDSHIELD. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP TO SEE IF COULD GET IT IN THE SHOP THAT DAY MARCH 31,2014 AND THEY WERE SO SWAMPED THEY MADE ME AN APPOINTMENT FOR TODAY APRIL 2, 2014. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED IN THE WAY THIS SITUATION WAS HANDLED ON TODAY THE SERVICE DEPT. PLAYED ME IN SAYING THAT IT WAS TANGLED WITHIN THE SEAT. THERE WAS NO SUCH THING THE SEATBELT MOVED FREELY LOCKED AT SOME POINTS AND DIDN'T LOCK AT SOME POINTS I HAVE VIDEO FOOTAGE TO SHOW JUST MINUTES BEFORE TAKING MY VEHICLE INTO THE DEALERSHIP RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE DEALERSHIP. THIS TYPE OF SAFETY ISSUE NEEDS TO BE RECTIFIED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE SOMEONE GETS SERIOUSLY HURT. ON THIS SPECIFIC DAY WAS THE ONLY TIME I USED THE MIDDLE SEATBELT. I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH AS TO HOW MUCH I'M A STICKLER FOR SAFETY AND ESPECIALLY  SEATBELT SAFETY THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED IN A BRAND NEW 2014 VEHICLE OFF THE SHOWROOM FLOOR. I BOUGHT THE CAR ON AROUND FEBRUARY 22, 2014 I HAVE BEEN SEEN IN EVERGREEN KIA 3 TIMES AS OF TODAY SINCE I'VE OWNED THE VEHICLE. PLEASE DON'T LET THIS COMPLAINT SLIP OR FALL INTO THE CRACKS .I WILL FOLLOW THROUGH ON ALL PAPER WORK FILED FOR THIS AND OTHER FUTURE SAFETY ISSUES WITH THE VEHICLE. I MAY BE CONTACTED AT ANY TIME OF DAY FOR ANY QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO THIS SAFETY ISSUE. THIS IS MAJOR BECAUSE SEATBELTS ARE MADE TO ENHANCE THE SAFETY OF A LIFE IF WORN  PROPERLY IN ANY VEHICLE. AS I RESEARCH KIA HAS HAD A RECALL ON THE SPORTAGE AND KIA SOUL FOR 2011 & 2012.  *TR",
