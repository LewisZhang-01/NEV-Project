Was also told that even if I were to get it inspected and checked for the problem that I would not be covered under the recall because they considered it \"wear and tear.\" the car is only at 110000 miles and has this extremely dangerous problem, but Nissan refuses to help fix their mistake.",

The vehicle was restarted, the contact was able to drive the vehicle however, the temperature gauge was fluctuating. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic who was diagnosed with radiator failure. The radiator was replaced. The contact stated several days the failure with the temperature gauge reoccurred. The vehicle was taken back to the independent mechanic where the failure was diagnosed as cooling sensor and ignition coil failure. The ignition coils and spark plugs were replaced however, the repair did not correct the failure. The contact stated that she then took the vehicle to Auto Zone where a diagnostic reader stated that the failure was the catalyst sensor needed replacement. The contact found NHTSA Campaign Number: 07V527000 (Engine and Engine Cooling) and contacted the local Nissan dealer to schedule an appointment. The manufacturer was not made aware of the failure.

THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS THE HANDLES ON CARS SHOULD NOT SNAP OFF AND PLASTIC HANDLES ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IN ALL CLIMATES.  2.  I HAVE HAD MY FRONT HEADLIGHTS CLEANED THREE TIMES AND THEY ALWAYS FOG UP WITHIN SEVERAL WEEKS OF CLEANING.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS SAID IT IS FAULTY DESIGN AND TO REPLACE THE HEADLAMPS IS CLOSE TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS WITH 1 YEAR GUARANTEE WHICH IS VERY COST PROHIBITIVE.  I HAVE SEEN CARS LESS THAN TWO YEARS OLD WITH OPAQUE HEAD LAMPS THIS IS UNACCETABLE AND DANGEROUS THAT LIGHTS CAN NOT PROJECT LIGHT APPROPRIATELY AND THIS IS ON MOST MODELS OF CARS.  IF YOU ARE IN RURAL AREAS AND THE LIGHTS DO NOT PROJECT LIGHT THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM.  I CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT METAL HANDLES AND DURABLE HEADLIGHT COVERS THAT DON'T FOG ARE NOT REQUIRED OF THESE COMPANIES.  UNTIL THE LAST 15-20 YEARS THIS WAS NEVER A PROBLEM BUT CAR MANUFACTURERS ARE OPTING FOR CHEAP MATERIALS THAT CAN HAVE LETHAL REPERCUSSIONS FOR CRUCIAL SAFETY ITEMS.  CAR HANDLES AND HEAD LAMPS AS FAR AS SAFETY ARE AS CRUCIAL AS PROPER AIRBAG FUNCTION.

WHY ELSE WOULD ANYONE DO THIS?  HE IS CLEARLY SICK AND HIS SICK DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR IS ESCALATING. EVERYDAY ILLEGALLY DANGEROUSLY REMOTELY HACKS MY VEHICLE MULTIPLE TIMES, DISABLED THE TRACTION.

A CLEAR & NORMAL SUMMER EVENING - NO SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS TO EVEN PROVOKE A CRAZY & SUDDEN INCIDENT LIKE THIS. LUCKILY -- I WAS NOT ON A HIGHWAY.

I CHECKED MY REAR VIEW MIRROR & MY ENTIRE CAR REAR WINDOW WAS BLOWN OUT WITH VERY LARGE HOLES & TINY SHATTERED GLASS PIECES STREWN ALL OVER INSIDE BACK SEAT AREA OF MY CAR. SOME SHATTERED GLASS EVEN BLEW OUT ALL WAY TO FRONT SECTION WHERE I WAS SEATED !! I IMMEDIATELY GOT OFF THE ROAD & PULLED OVER INTO NEARBY WALGREENS PARKING LOT & CALLED LOCAL POLICE. POLICEMAN CAME & EXAMINED MY CAR. HE DID NOT FEEL ANY FOUL PLAY WAS INVOLVED NOR ANY GUNSHOT NOR BASEBALL THROWN INTO MY REAR CAR WINDOW. I TOOK 24 PHOTOS ? SEE 5 UPLOADED. HE HELPED ME GATHER MOST OF BROKEN & SHATTERED GLASS INTO A PLASTIC BAG. WE NOTED A FEW PIECES HAD DARK BROWN BURN MARKS ON THEM. HE SAID MOST LIKELY IT INDICATED A \"SHORT\" OCCURRED IN REAR DEFROSTER ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. HE COULD NOT PREPARE POLICE REPORT BCUZ IT DID NOT INVOLVE ANY FOUL PLAY. NEXT DAY I CALLED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS (NCA). THEY ASKED ME TO EMAIL MY 24 PHOTOS TO NCA & ONLY AGREED TO PAY TO REPLACE REAR CAR WINDOW. I TOLD NCA IT WAS PROBABLY A SHORT IN REAR DEFROSTER ELECTRICAL SYSTEM ? A SERIOUS NISSAN SAFETY ISSUE & DEFECT. FOR ME ? A SCARY INCIDENT !!

THE UNRUSTED HALVES ARE PAINTED, HAVE NO \"SHINGLES\" AND NO RUST WHATSOEVER DESPITE BEING BUTTED RIGHT UP TO THE RUSTED HALVES.

FOR INSTANCE, I HAVE A 1.5 MILE RIDE TO THE TRAIN FOR MY COMMUTE TO WORK.  BY THE TIME I GET TO THE TRAIN, I'LL NEED TO USE MY INHALER AGAIN ALREADY.  MY CAR IS PAID OFF.  I HAD PLANNED TO KEEP THIS CAR AS LONG AS I POSSIBLY COULD SO I CAN PAY DOWN DEBT. ALSO, I HAD JUST THIS PAST WEEKEND SPENT AROUND $700 IN REPAIRS ON MY CAR.  I'VE TAKEN VERY GOOD CARE OF MY CAR (I.E., REGULAR OIL CHANGES, TIRE ROTATION, ETC.).  I JUST WANT NISSAN TO FIX THE PROBLEM SO I CAN KEEP MY CAR.  OTHER THAN THIS ISSUE, I LOVE MY CAR.  I'VE HAD VERY FEW MINOR PROBLEMS WITH IT OVER THE YEARS AND I'M OVERALL VERY HAPPY WITH IT, EXCEPT FOR THIS ISSUE.  I HOPE YOU CAN GET THEM TO HELP EVERYONE SIMILARLY SITUATED...UPDATED 09/03/15 *BF    UPDATED 11/06/2017*CN",

WHEN I DO GET IN AN ACCIDENT I WILL SUE NISSAN AND ANYBODY ELSE WHO KNEW ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS WITH THIS CAR AND SAT BACK AND DID NOTHING.",

CALLED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS 4-13-15 TO REPORT THE ISSUE AND REQUEST THEY REPAIR IT SINCE I REMEMBERED SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASING THE VEHICLE, I HAD RECEIVED A NOTICE REGARDING POSSIBLE CORROSION OF THE REAR SUB-FRAME [NOT SAME PART BUT STILL UNDERCARRIAGE RELATED AND PERHAPS MANUFACTURED BY THE SAME COMPANY].

CALLED CONSUMER AFFAIRS BACK [SAME DAY] AND CASE WAS ASSIGNED TO A REPRESENTATIVE.  REP CALLED 4-14-15 AND TOLD ME TO GET AN ESTIMATE [THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT PERFORM THIS TYPE OF REPAIR SO THEY COULD NOT GIVE AN ESTIMATE].

THAT IS WHEN HE DISCOVERED A HOLE AT LEAST 9 INCHES IN THE FLOOR. I ASKED THE PREVIOUS OWNER IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED THAT WOULD CAUSE THAT AND HE SAID SO IT WAS NEVER IN AN ACCIDENT AND THE DEALER WHO DID ALL THE MAINTENANCE WORK NEVER MENTIONED SEEING A RUST SPOT.  NOW THE HOLE IS HUGE AND IS GOING FAST.  WE HAVE TO USE THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD A NEW ONE.  NISSAN SAYS IT IS BECAUSE IT IS AN OLD CAR.  MY 1993 HONDA CIVIC (OVER 210,000 WISCONSIN MILES ON IT) AND MY HUSBAND'S 2002 NISSAN SENTRA SER ARE OLDER AND THEY DO NOT HAVE RUST UNDERNEATH.  WE HAVE TO DRIVE WITH A WINDOW OPEN BECAUSE THE EXHAUST SMELL AT A STOP SIGN OR WHEN THE WIND IS BLOWING AGAINST THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR.  WE HAVE 2 YOUNG KIDS THAT HAVE TO RIDE IN THIS CAR AS WE NO LONGER HAVE THE CIVIC AND THE SER IS SMALL.  WISH NISSAN WOULD OWN THEIR MISTAKE/DESIGN FLAW AND FIX THIS FOR EVERYONE.

UNDER FURTHER INSPECTION I NOTICED SEVERE RUSTING AND IT HAD ACTUALLY RUSTED COMPLETELY THROUGH THE FLOOR BOARD.  THE ONLY THING HOLDING MY FEET IN THE CAR WAS THE CARPET.  I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED NISSAN AND WAS TOLD OH WELL SO SAD NOT GONNA HELP ME BECAUSE THE CAR WAS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY.  I HAD PRETTY MUCH ALWAYS HAD THE CAR SERVICED REGULARLY AT  UFTRING NISSAN IN PEORIA ILLINOIS.   THIS WAS NEVER MENTIONED IN THE 4 YEARS PRIOR TO ME IN THE MANY TRIPS I MADE FOR ROUTINE OIL CHANGES AND SEVERAL STRUT REPAIRS ON THIS CAR.   YES I HAVE HAD STRUT ISSUES WITH THIS CAR FROM DAY ONE.  THEY HAVE BEEN REPLACED AT LEAST 6 TIMES SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR IN 2008.  ANYHOW, I TOOK THE CAR TO MY BODY GUY AND HE REPLACED. THE FLOORBOARD FOR 500 BUCKS AND SAID THE DRIVER SIDE IS HEADED IN THE SAME DIRECTION.  AT THIS TIME I KNOW OF NO ISSUES WITH RUSTING ON THE DRIVERS SIDE.  I PERSONALLY CHECK EVERY TIME THE CAR IS LIFTED.  HOWEVER IF IT IS RUSTING FROM THE INSIDE OUT IT IS MORE THAN POSSIBLE THAT BY THE TIME I COULD VISUALLY SEE DAMAGE IT WILL BE COMPLETELY THROUGH WITH CARPET BEING THE ONLY THING KEEPING ME INSIDE.  I ABSOLUTELY WANT NISSAN TO NOT ONLY PAY FOR THE FIRST REPLACEMENT BUT FIX THE PROBLEM SO I AM NOT PARANOID ABOUT THE SEAT FALLING THROUGH WHEN I AM DRIVING ON THE ROAD.

I EVENTUALLY MADE IT HOME WITH THE CAR GOING A VERY LOW SPEED AND THEN SPEED UP, BUT WHEN CAR TO A START THE ENGINE STALLS. THE VEHICLE WAS PUT ON A COMPUTER TO SEE WHAT THE DIAGNOSIS WERE AND IT WAS THE CAMSHAFT SENSORS AND CRANKSHAFT SENSOR COSTING $80 DOLLARS FOR TWO AND $70 FOR ANOTHER, HOWEVER THESE ITEMS HAS BEEN CHANGED ALONG WITH A TUNE UP AND THE CAR IS DOING THE SAME. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THE COMPUTER, I NOTICED THERE WERE RECALLS ON THE CRANKSHAFT SENSORS AND THE ECM. I CONTACTED NISSAN DEALER, AN APPOINTMENT WAS MADE AND I WAS TOLD THAT MY VIN NUMBER IS NOT SHOWING SO THE PROBLEM HAD TO BEEN DONE, BECAUSE I'M THE SECOND OWNER. IT'S FUNNY HOW THIS PROBLEM COMES ABOUT AFTER 4 1/2 YEARS OF HAVING THIS VEHICLE AND THE RECALL SUPPOSE TO HAVE BEEN TAKING CARE OF WITH THE FIRST OWNER. THIS IS AN INCONVENIENCE AND IT'S FRUSTRATING. THERE IS ALSO RUSTING OF THE FLOOR UNDER THE CAR, YOU CAN SEE THE FLOOR COMING DOWN FROM UNDER THE CAR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. THIS IS AN OUTRAGE AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE AT THE COST OF THE DEALERS AND NOT THE OWNERS. THIS IS DANGEROUS, YOU CAN BE DRIVING AT A SPEED AND THE CAR JUST STOP, WHICH CAN CAUSE A VERY BAD ACCIDENT.  *TR",

THE MOST RECENT OF WHICH IS THE \"GREY\" AREA OF THE ECM ISSUE IN COORDINATION WITH FAMOUS THE CAMSHAFT CRANKSHAFT FAULT P0355 & P0131.  I'M AN ENGINEER AND FULLY UNDERSTAND THE MECHANICS OF A VEHICLE. THIS SENSOR WAS A FAULTY DESIGN FROM THE BEGINNING IN WHICH OIL COULD ENTER INSIDE THE SENSOR, THEREFORE CAUSING A SHORT AND DISABLING THE ENTIRE VEHICLE WHILE IN MOTION.  THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME AND WAS A TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE.  TO FIX THE ISSUE CHEAPLY, NISSAN ISSUED A RECALL TO REPROGRAM THE ECM IN ORDER TO RECOGNIZE THE ?FAULTY? CRANKSHAFT SENSOR PART.  BUT IN ORDER TO SAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, NISSAN WOULD NOT INCLUDE THE WARRANTIED REPLACEMENT OF THE FAULTY CRANKSHAFT SENSOR DESIGN (MAGNET SENSOR).  INSTEAD, THE CONSUMER (MYSELF) WOULD HAVE TO PAY BETWEEN $300 & $450 TO HAVE THE SENSOR REPLACED WITH THE ?NEW & IMPROVED VERSION?.  NEW AND IMPROVED MEANS THE PROPERLY DESIGNED VERSION.  THE INITIAL DESIGN SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECALLED BUT IT WASN'T.  IT DOESN'T TAKE AN ENGINEER TO FIGURE THIS OUT BUT I AM ONE AND FULLY UNDERSTAND THE ?BIG PICTURE? OF THE RECALL AND LACK OF INCLUSION OF THE CRANKSHAFT SENSOR REPAIRS.  I AM REQUESTING NISSAN TO COVER THE FULL COST OF THE CAMSHAFT & CRANKSHAFT SENSOR & THE ASSOCIATED LABOR.    I WAS PUT IN HARM?S WAY DURING THE INITIAL RECALL ISSUE IN WHICH MY CAR SHUT OFF WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY.  THAT IS A BAD ENOUGH EXPERIENCE. I AM NOT WILLING TO ALSO PAY NISSAN $400 TO REPAIR THE FAULTY SENSOR WHICH WAS A LARGE PART OF WHY THIS OCCURRED IN THE FIRST PLACE.   *TR",

I UNDERSTAND CARS RUST, BUT THERE IS NO WAY THE RUST HAPPENED OVERNIGHT.  BASED ON THE EXTENT OF THE RUST, THE FLOOR PAN WAS MOST LIKELY SEVERELY RUSTED PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE RUST WARRANTY.  NISSAN SHOULD STAND BY THERE PRODUCT AND REPAIR THE DAMAGE THAT APPEARS TO BE WIDESPREAD AND MODEL SPECIFIC.  NISSAN SHOULD NOT ONLY FIX THOSE VEHICLES WHERE THE OWNERS HAVE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED BY A GOOD SAMARITAN CHANGING THE OIL.  I FEEL PENALIZED FOR NOT PERSONALLY CLIMBING UNDER MY CAR AND PERIODICALLY INSPECTING IT.  SUFFICE IT TO SAY, THERE IS ONLY CARPET SEPARATING THE PASSENGERS FEET AND THE PAVEMENT BELOW.  NOT A REASSURING FEELING.....  *TR",

THE RUST IS LOCATED IN THE SAME SPOT ON EACH SIDE BY THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER FLOOR MATS. ON A SHOP LIFT YOU CAN SEE THAT THE RUST INITIALLY FORMED ON EACH SIDE WHERE THE DRAIN HOLES WERE INSTALLED. AT NISSAN'S REQUEST, I TOOK MY CAR (BOUGHT NEW) TO THE NEAREST NISSAN FOR INSPECTION.  MY COMPLAINT WITH NISSAN CORPORATE WAS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON FLOOR PAN RUST AS IT IS A SAFETY CONCERN I.E THE SEAT CAN MALFUNCTION AND ALSO CARBON DIOXIDE COULD GET INSIDE THE CAR. I ALSO MENTIONED THAT I WAS AWARE ANY KIND OF RUST WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THAT THE REASON FOR THE RUST HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LIVING IN HIGH SALT STATE. AFTER EXTENSIVE RESEARCH, IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THIS HAS TO BE A DESIGN FLAW BY NISSAN AND THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ON MAINLY 2ND GEN. ALTIMAS HAVING THIS ADV. FLOOR PAN RUST IN THE EXACT SAME AREAS!! IF THE RUST WAS SPORADIC, THEN SALT WOULD MOST LIKELY BE A CAUSE, AND IF WET SNOWY SHOES  WAS THE PROBLEM THEN THERE WOULD BE RUST UNDER THE REAR FLOOR PANS. AS A RESULT, AS NOTED ON THE NISSAN FORUM WEBSITE, A MORE VALID CAUSE IS DESIGN FLAW, DRAIN HOLES WERE IMPROPERLY INSTALLED ALLOWING WATER TO CONGREGATE AND RUST TO FORM.  AFTER NISSAN INVESTIGATED MY FILE,THEY STATED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO TO HELP. NOT EVEN PARTIAL REIMBURSEMENT. I FIND THIS UNBELIEVABLE AND UNACCEPTABLE.THIS 2ND GENERATION ALTIMA FLOOR PAN RUST IS SO COMMON THAT EVEN MY NEIGHBOR'S 05 ALTIMA HAS THE SAME RUST SPOTS AS WELL. WHAT ALSO DISAPPOINTS ME IS THAT I HAVE HAD ALL OF MY OIL CHANGES DONE BY NISSAN AND RUST WAS NEVER MENTIONED ONCE.",

AS OF TODAY JULY 30. 2013 THE CAR ONCE AGAIN IS STALLING. FRIEND OF MIND TOLD ME BOUT THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT BOUT THE NISSANS TRANS. AS A WOMAN WHO DEPENDS ON HER CAR ALOT I CAN TELL YOU THAT OWNING THIS CAR HAS NOT BEEN PLEASANT AT ALL. I HAVE HAD IT STALL ON ME AT BUSY INTERSECTIONS, HIGHWAYS, AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NITE WHILE WORKING. NISSAN DOESN'T SEEM TO REALIZE THAT THEIR WAY OF DOING BUSINESS AND HIDING THE TRUTH BEHIND THEIR DEFECTIVE VEHICLES IS AND CONTINUES TO PUT PEOPLE LIVES IN JEOPARDY. ALL THEY CARE ABOUT IS THEIR PRODUCT BEING OUT ON THE STREET. IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SUCH A PRETTY CAR WAS A PIECE OF CRACK, I WOULD HAVE SPENT ALOT LESS THAN 20000 DOLLARS ON A NEW CAR THAT WAS SO CALLED GOOD QUALITY.  *TR",

I TRIED TO START THE ENGINE RIGHT AWAY. IT'S NOW HARD TO START UNLIKE BEFORE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE STARTING A CAR WITH A WEAK BATTERY ON IT BUT I KNOW MY BATTERY IS STILL GOOD THAT'S WHY I SUSPECTED SOMETHING WENT WRONG WITH THE ENGINE. FINALLY AFTER 3 SECONDS THE ENGINE STARTED BUT THE \"SERVICE ENGINE SOON\" LIGHT TURNED ON. WHEN I HIT THE GAS PEDAL, THE CAR DIDN'T ACCELERATE AS IT DID BEFORE THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED. THE FOLLOWING DAY I BROUGHT MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT IT. AFTER RUNNING SOME DIAGNOSTICS, THEY FOUND OUT THAT THE CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSORS AND CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. I ASK IF THERE WAS ANY RECALL ISSUE REGARDING THIS PROBLEM AND THEY SAID NONE. THE CALCULATED TOTAL COST WAS $631.00. AFTER FURTHER NEGOTIATION THE PRICE WENT DOWN TO $550.00. WHILE WAITING FOR THE SERVICE TO BE FINISHED I BROWSED THE NET AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE WERE ALSO THE SAME PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BY OTHER NISSAN ALTIMA OWNERS. I ASKED THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN IF THERE'S REALLY NO RECALL FOR THIS DESPITE OF MANY CONSUMER COMPLAINTS AND THEY EVEN PRINTED ME A RESULT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO CAMPAIGN FOR THIS ISSUE. I WENT HOME WONDERING WHY THERE IS NO \"RECALL\" MADE TO FIX THIS SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. WHAT IF I WAS DRIVING IN A HIGHWAY AT 70 MPH AND THE ENGINE SUDDENLY SHUT DOWN?   *TR",

I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS AND SEEN NUMEROUS ON-LINE BLOGS AND FORMAL COMPLAINTS FILED TO NHTSA ON THE SAME ISSUE FOR NISSAN OWNERS.  I DID PERSONALLY CONTACT NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND FILED A CLAIM WITH THEM ON THIS MATTER.  THEY VERY POLITELY TURNED ME DOWN ON ANY SUPPORT FOR THE STRUCTURAL ISSUE AND SAID THE CAR IS TOO OLD (7 YRS) AND NOT UNDER WARRANTY ANYMORE.

CLUTCH PEDAL FELL TO FLOOR AND REMAINED THERE, PREVENTING A DOWNSHIFT OR TO NEUTRAL. \"FLOATED\" THE TRANSMISSION INTO NEUTRAL AND PULLED PEDAL BACK UP WITH MY FOOT. WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR HOME BY LIFTING THE PEDAL AFTER EVERY SHIFT. REPLACEMENT OF THE CLUTCH MASTER AND SLAVE CYLINDERS, AND WELDING THE HOUSING OF THE CLUTCH PEDAL DUE TO (STRESS FRACTURES) RESOLVED THE ISSUE FOR ABOUT 11 MONTHS/15,000 MILES, WHEN THE ISSUE BEGAN AGAIN. AFTER A FEW MORE MONTHS THE ENTIRE CLUTCH SYSTEM; CLUTCH PLATE (NOT WORN OUT), CLUTCH COVER, FLYWHEEL ASSEMBLY, MASTER AND SLAVE CYLINDER, PEDAL ASSEMBLY AND RUBBER HYDRAULIC LINE WERE REPLACED. THE SYSTEM WAS THOROUGHLY FLUSHED AND BLED FOR TRAPPED AIR. ISSUE WAS RESOLVED UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO (6 MONTHS AFTER REPLACING THE SYSTEM) WHEN THE PROBLEM RESURFACED. BLEEDING OF THE SYSTEM WAS AGAIN PERFORMED WITH NO CHANGE: PEDAL WILL FALL TO THE FLOOR AND STAY THERE IF HELD FOR 1-2 SECONDS. IF THE PEDAL IS DEPRESSED ABOUT 1-2 INCHES AND HELP FOR A FEW SECONDS, IT WILL BEGIN TO PULL ITSELF TO THE FLOOR WITH NO ASSISTANCE FROM THE DRIVER AT ALL. I AM PLANNING TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM ONCE AGAIN.  *TR",

I TOOK IT TO THE MECHANIC WHO TOLD ME THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT. THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME SOO MANY TIMES NOW.  I WILL BE DRIVING AND THEIR WOULD BE NO PRESSURE IN THE CLUTCH, IT WOULD GO ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND ALL THE TIME  I'D HAVE TO USE MY FEET TO POP IT BACK UP.  ONE INCIDENT HAPPENED WHEN I WAS PARKED.  I TURNED MY CAR ON AND PUT MY FOOT ON CLUTCH, NO PRESSURE.  USUALLY I COULD PUT IT IN GEAR, DRIVE IT AROUND FOR 10 MINS (POPPING THE CLUTCH BACK UP) THE WHOLE TIME AND THE PRESSURE WOULD START TO COME BACK AFTER A COUPLE DRIVES AROUND THE BLOCK.  THIS TIME, I COULDN'T EVEN PUT THE CAR IN GEAR.  I WAS STUCK FOR ALMOST 30 MINS, TRYING TO PUMP THE CLUTCH, TURNING THE CAR ON AND OFF, DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE.  FINALLY I WAS ABLE TO PUT IT IN GEAR AND DROVE IT AROUND THE BLOCK AND THEN STRAIGHT TO THE MECHANIC.  WHO TOLD ME NOTHING. BASICALLY HE BLED SYSTEM, AND SO FORTH AND SO FORTH.  JUST YESTERDAY, THIS HAPPENED AGAIN WHILE DRIVING IN BUSY STREET IN MY CITY.  IT IS VERY, VERY DANGEROUS AND AS I BEGAN TO RESEARCH ONLINE, I NOTICED THAT OTHERS ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS.  I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY I'VE PUT INTO TRYING TO \"FIX\" THIS PROBLEM BUT THEIR SHOULD BE A RECALL FOR THIS VEHICLE.

I ASKED IF IT'''S NISSAN'''S POSITION THAT I WAS NEGLIGENT IN MAINTAINING MY VEHICLE. HOW ELSE WOULD YOU EXPLAIN A 6 YR LOW-MILEAGE CAR HAVING EXTENSIVE RUST ISSUES? WOULD THEY AT LEAST ADMIT TO PARTIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND HELP WITH THE COST OF REPAIRS? EVERYTHING ON MY CAR IS STILL LIKE NEW EXCEPT PREMATURE RUSTING THROUGH THE FLOORBOARDS ON BOTH THE DRIVER'S SIDE AND PASSENGER SIDE. I EXPLAINED I'VE DILIGENTLY MAINTAINED THIS VEHICLE WITH THE HOPES OF IT LASTING FOR YEARS BASED ON THE REPUTATION OF IMPORTED CARS. IT'S BEEN GARAGED DURING MOST INCLEMENT WEATHER. I EXPLAINED HOW SHOCKED I WAS WHEN I SAW ALL THE COMPLAINTS, FORUMS, AND BLOGS REGARDING THIS ISSUE. THERE SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM EITHER WITH THE MATERIAL (DURASTEEL) OR THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS OF ALL THE GEN 3 AND 4 ALTIMAS THAT ALLOWS WATER TO INFILTRATE BETWEEN THE METAL ON THE FLOORBOARDS CAUSING PREMATURE RUST THROUGH. THERE ARE PLASTIC PLUGS THAT BECOME DISLODGED OR ARE NOT INSTALLED CORRECTLY. NISSAN WILL NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT AND HELP WITH THE REPAIRS. NISSAN HAS BEEN REQUIRED TO EXTEND THE WARRANTY ON THE REAR SUBFRAME SO THEY ARE AWARE OF ISSUE WITH THE METALS THEY'RE USING. REGARDLESS, I WILL NEVER OWN ANOTHER NISSAN. PLEASE CHECK AND IF YOU'RE FACING THE SAME EXPENSIVE REPAIR, CALL NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS @ 800-647-7261 AND ASK TO FILE A COMPLAINT. THEY WILL BE SURPRISED AND SAY \"THIS IS THE FIRST WE'VE HEARD OF THIS.\"' DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WAITING FOR A REPLY. IMMEDIATELY FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AND NHTSA.

THIS SHOULDN'T HAPPEN TO A 5 NOW 6 YEAR OLD CAR.  TRY BEING IN 0 DEGREE WEATHER WITH THE AIR CONDITIONER BLOWING AT YOU AND BEING TOLD THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG. THIS HAS TO BE A DEFECT BECAUSE I HAVE HAD MANY 10-15 YEAR OLD CARS AND NEVER HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED TO THAT I CAN HAVE HEAT, AND NOW THAT MY A/C IS DISCONNECTED I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY DEFROSTER WORKING, BUT A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR NOT GETTING FROST BITE IN THE FRIGID TEMPS.  *TR",

        "summary": "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: I PURCHASED A 2005 NISSAN ALTIMA IN JULY 2009. RECENTLY, I HAD MY CAR INSPECTED AND A RUST PERFORATION WAS NOTICED ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE PASSENGER SIDE. IT IS THE SIZE OF A BASEBALL WHICH IS THROUGH THE FIRST LAYER OF METAL. I SPOKE WITH THE DEALER, WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE, AND THEY STATED THAT MY WARRANTY FOR PERFORATION WAS 5 YEARS AND HAS EXPIRED. I HAD PLANNED ON REPAIRING IT MYSELF; HOWEVER, UPON ONLINE RESEARCH I FOUND THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 2002-2006 ALTIMA MODELS. THE PERFORATION ON THESE CARS APPEARS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE FLOOR EXACTLY WHERE MINE IS. THE FLOOR IS DESIGNED WITH TWO PIECES OF SHEET METAL WITH A GAP IN BETWEEN WHICH, UNFORTUNATELY ALLOWS WATER TO BECOME TRAPPED. THIS IS A DESIGN ERROR WHICH CAUSES PREMATURE RUST TO FORM. I AM CONCERNED THAT IF I REPAIR THE RUST, IT WILL INEVITABLY RETURN.  I CONTACTED NISSAN CANADA AND WAS TOLD THE SAME STORY REGARDING MY EXPIRED PERFORATION WARRANTY. I EXPLAINED THE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ONLINE CONCERNING THIS MATTER AND WAS SURPRISED THAT THE SERVICE AGENT WAS UNAWARE OF THIS ISSUE. I UNDERSTAND THAT MY WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED; HOWEVER, IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE FLOOR OF THE CAR RUSTED PREMATURELY DUE TO A DESIGN FLAW. I TAKE PRIDE AND CARE OF MY VEHICLE AND I EXPECT NISSAN TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS FLAW AND ENACT A RECALL FOR THE FLOOR ON ALL 2002-2006 NISSAN ALTIMAS OR, AT A MINIMON PAY FOR THE REPAIRS ON MY VEHICLE.

I GOT BOTH THE SENSORS AND THE RECALL PERFORMED BY THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP. AFTER THE RECALL WAS PERFORMED, THE CAR WAS STILL NOT PERFORMING CORRECTLY, SO I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP, WHO DID THE RECALL PROGRAMMING AGAIN, AND THE CAR HAS BEEN RUNNING WELL EVER SINCE. MY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP FORCED ME TO HAVE EXTRA WORK DONE, EVEN THOUGH MY SENSORS WERE GOOD AND THE RECALL DOESN'T SPECIFY THAT SENSORS HAVE TO BE REPLACED BEFORE THE RECALL IS PERFORMED. *TR",

I HAVE A FAMILY AND KIDS THAT HAS TO GO EVERYDAY THINGS AND HAVING THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN A PAIN. I THINK NISSAN NEEDS TO TRY MORE TO CONTACT THERE CUSTOMER AND LET THEM KNOW. I KNOW I'VE HAD THE SAME ADDRESS AND WAS NEVER NOTICED! SO KNOW I TOOK IT TO NISSAN AND THERE TELLING ME I HAVE TO PAY 220$ FOR THE CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR?? IM LIKE WHAT.. THE ONLY THING THERE DOING IS REPROGRAMMING IT!! *TR",

NISSAN IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM BUT REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT (ACCORDING TO OTHER CONSUMERS THAT COMPLAINED TO NISSAN).  AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS FAILURE, THE CAR CAN STOP IN MOTION. SEVERAL OF THE CONSUMERS HAD THEIR CARS STOP ON THE HIGHWAY WHICH CAN BE FATAL. THE ONLY SYMPTOMS ARE JERKING AND SHAKING OF THE CAR FOLLOWED BY STALLING.     THE REPAIR COSTS AROUND $250, BUT IT IS NOT A GURANTEED FIX. MANY CONSUMERS HAD THEM HAPPEN NUMEROUS TIMES, AND HAD TO FIX THEM WITH THEIR OWN MONEY EVERY TIME.

UNDER WARRANTY, NISSAN REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION AND CLUTCH ASSEMBLY.

THE CLUTCH APPEARS TO FAIL AFTER AN HOUR OR SO OF DRIVING OR AFTER IT GETS WARM, WITH NO WARNING. THE DEALER DROVE IT FOR 7 MILE AND SAYS IT CAN'T DUPLICATE THE ISSUE..

THIS IS PROBLEMDANGEROUS, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE BEING STUCK IN TRAFFIC AND NOT BEING ABLE TO MOVE. AND NOT KNOWING WHEN YOU CAN RELY ON YOUR CAR, AND WHEN YOU CAN'T?

I WAS NEARLY HALFWAY THROUGH MY 12 HOUR ONE DAY RETURN TRIP. I GOT HUNG UP IN STOPPED TRAFFIC IN NY FOR ABOUT ONE HOUR FIFTEEN MINUTES. WE PULLED OFF THE HIGHWAY TO A REST STOP AND HAD DINNER FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES. I RETURNED TO THE CAR, SPENT ANOTHER FIVE MINUTES IN TRAFFIC AND WAS MOVING ALONG AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AGAIN. THE CAR WAS LOADED WITH 2 ADULTS AND 3 CHILDREN AND ABOUT 125 POUNDS OF VACATION STUFF. UPON APPROACHING A TOLL BOOTH ON THE NY \"EXPRESSWAY\" I DEPRESSED THE CLUTCH TO BEGIN DOWNSHIFTING AND DECELERATING FROM ROUGHLY 60 MPH. THE CLUTCH PEDAL FELL TO THE FLOOR. SINCE THIS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE I WAS NOT CAUGHT COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE. I PUT THE TRANSMISSION IN NEUTRAL AND BEGAN PUMPING THE CLUTCH AS THE CAR COASTED IN TOWARDS THE TOLL BOOTH. I WAS ABLE TO PUMP THE CLUTCH BECAUSE IT DID HAVE SOME SMALL DEGREE OF RETURN, BUT IT DID NOT REACH THE HEIGHT OF THE TYPICAL PICKUP POINT WHICH I ESTIMATE TO BE 6-8 INCHES OFF THE FLOORBOARD. PUMPING THE PEDAL HAD NO EFFECT. I PLACED MY FOOT UNDER THE PEDAL AND LIFTED IT ALL THE WAY UP. PRESSING AGAIN HAD THE SAME RESULT. VERY LITTLE FRICTION. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TOLL WAS DEAD STOPPED TRAFFIC. THERE WAS ENOUGH FRICTION IN THE PEDAL TO ENGAGE THE CLUTCH PLATES AND TO SHIFT BETWEEN GEARS. THE TRAFFIC SPEED INCREASED AND AFTER A FEW HUNDRED YARDS THE CLUTCH RECUPERATED ON ITS OWN.  I ALWAYS DOUBLE DECLUTCH AND HAVE NEVER HAD TO REPLACE CLUTCH PLATES IN MY CARS.

THIS HAS BEEN REPORTED OVER AND OVER IN THE NISSAN FORUM. UNFORTUNATELY, ONLY A FEW PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED TO NHTSA. I USED MY CAR ON A SUNDAY MORNING FOR A SHORT RUN TO THE GROCERY STORE (APPROXIMATELY 8 MILES ROUND TRIP). I LEFT THE CAR IN THE DIRECT SUNLIGHT ON MY BLACKTOP DRIVEWAY ALL DAY (ABOUT 85 DEGREE F). IN THE LATE AFTERNOON I STARTED MY CAR TO PUT IT IN THE GARAGE. BEFORE I TURNED THE IGNITION I DEPRESSED THE CLUTCH AND IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THAT THERE WAS NO PICKUP POINT. THE PEDAL WAS EASILY DEPRESSED TO THE FLOORBOARD AND THE TYPICAL RESISTANCE IN THE PEDAL THROW WAS NONEXISTENT. THE CAR WAS ALREADY IN GEAR AND WHEN I LET THE CLUTCH OUT THERE WAS BARELY ENOUGH RESISTANCE TO ENGAGE THE CLUTCH PLATES AND PULL THE CAR INTO THE GARAGE. THE PICKUP POINT WAS JUST A COUPLE OF INCHES OFF THE FLOORBOARD, WHEREAS THE USUAL PICKUP POINT IS ANYWHERE FROM 6-8 INCHES. I LEFT THE CAR IN THE GARAGE AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT ON MONDAY. WHEN I STARTED MY CAR ON TUESDAY TO BRING IT IN TO THE DEALERSHIP, THERE WAS NO ISSUE AT ALL. I PAID MY $46.50 TO GET THIS ON RECORD WITH THE DEALER.

ON A RECENT TRIP I NOTICED DIFFICULTY CRANKING AND SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT REMAINED ON.  I WAS 5 HOURS FROM MY HOME WITH MY FAMILY IN THE CAR.  IT WAS A WEEKEND, SO NO NISSAN DEALER WAS OPEN OR EVEN IN THE VICINITY OF MY LOCATION.  AFTER CROSSING ALL FINGERS AND NURSING THE CAR HOME, I IMMEDIATELY TOOK IT TO MY NORMAL DEALER ON MONDAY MORNING.  I WAS TOLD THE \"TECH FOUND A CODE FOR A FAILED CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR\".  THE SERVICE MANAGER CHECKED MY VIN FOR ANY BULLETINS OR RECALLS AND FOUND NONE.  I WAS CHARGED $230 TO REPLACE THE FAILED PART.  I CALLED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS ASKING FOR REIMBURSEMENT BASED ON THE FAILURE FREQUENCY RATE OF THIS SENSOR.  AFTER MANY PHONE CALLS AND VOICEMAILS I WAS TOLD THAT NISSAN WOULD NOT REIMBURSE THE CHARGES.  I ASKED IF THE FAILURE RATE OF THE SENSOR WAS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THEIR DECISION - THE ANSWER WAS NO.  I ASKED WHAT THE FAILURE RATE WAS FOR THE SENSOR - MY REP, THE REGIONAL SPECIALIST, DID NOT HAVE THAT INFORMATION.     BASED ON MY RESEARCH, IT APPEARS THERE IS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RATE OF FAILURE FOR THE CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR ALONG WITH SEVERAL REDESIGNS OF THE OEM PART.  NISSAN DOES NOT SEEM TO BE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROBLEM.  I AM DISAPPOINTED AS, UP UNTIL NOW, I HAD BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH THE VEHICLE AND WITH NISSAN OVERALL. *TR",

MOTORIST PULLED INTO THE PARKING LOT ADJACENT TO THE STUDENT CENTER, AND DROVE AROUND LOOKING FOR SUITABLE PARKING SPOT. AFTER ONE LAP AT CREEPING SPEED OF 5 MPH, MOTORIST FOUND AN UNOCCUPIED PARKING SPOT FACING THE WOODS. MOTORIST PULLED INTO AVAILABLE PARKING SPOT, NOSE FIRST, AND SLOWED DOWN. WHEN AFOREMENTIONED VEHICLE CAME TO A COMPLETE STILL STAND, MOTORIST THEN INTENDED TO SHIFT THE GEARSHIFT FROM THE 'D' INTO THE 'P' POSITION, GOING THROUGH 'N, R'. WITH RIGHT FOOT ON BREAK PEDAL, MOTORIST SHIFTED GEARSHIFT FORWARDS, WHEN THE GEARSHIFT SUDDENLY GOT STUCK IN THE 'N' POSITION. THE VEHICLE'S ENGINE, HOWEVER, UNEXPECTEDLY REVVED LOUDLY. THE VEHICLE SIMULTANEOUSLY ACCELERATED UNCONTROLLABLY FORWARDS, RUNNING OVER A 4-FOOT LONG, 8-INCH TALL CONCRETE STOPPER BLOCK, THEN GOING OVER THE 6-INCH HIGH SIDEWALK, AND INEVITABLY MOVING INTO THE WOODS, WHERE VEHICLE HIT A TREE AND FINALLY CAME TO A COMPLETE HALT, WITH GEARSHIFT STILL BEING IN 'N' POSITION. SHAKEN BY THIS STARTLING EXPERIENCE AND BY DRIVER'S AIRBAG, MOTORIST INSTANTANEOUSLY TURNED CAR'S ENGINE OFF BY TURNING THE IGNITION KEYS COUNTERCLOCKWISE. THE TRAUMATIZED AND BRUISED MOTORIST NOTICED SMOKE EMANATING FROM STEERING WHEEL, THUS DECIDED TO STEP OUT OF VEHICLE. AT 1ST GLANCE, THE COLLISION DAMAGED RIGHT FENDER, BOTTOM METAL FRAME, HOOD, RIGHT HEADLIGHT AS WELL AS BUMPER. WITNESSES ASSISTED MOTORIST IN ARRANGING TOW-TRUCK TO PICK-UP INCAPACITATED VEHICLE. IT APPEARS THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS ACCIDENT LIES IN MECHANICAL FAILURE: A DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION. IT'S UNSAFE TO DRIVE A VEHICLE WITH AN UNDEPENDABLE TRANSMISSION. LUCKILY, NO PEDESTRIANS WERE IN THE WAY OF THE UNCONTROLLABLE VEHICLE.

IN JUNE, MY CAR STALLED ON THE HIGHWAY. I TOWED IT HOME AND DISCOVERED VIA A CODE READER THAT THE CPS FAILED, AND BY GOOGLE & THE NHTSA WEB SITE THAT THIS WAS PART OF THE RECALL ID'D ABOVE.

POOR ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING DEFECTS LEAD TO ISSUES THAT CAN CAUSE THE SECONDARY TIMING CHAINS ON THESE VEHICLES TO FAIL.  THE PROBLEM DOES NOT BECOME APPARENT UNTIL AFTER THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED, I.E. AFTER 60,000 MILES OF SERVICE.  REPAIR REQUIRES THE ENGINE TO BE REMOVED FROM THE VEHICLE AND TORN DOWN TO REPLACE THESE PARTS.  PARTS INCLUDE THE SECONDARY TIMING CHAINS AND CHAIN TENSIONERS.  NISSAN IS REFUSING TO SUPPORT THEIR CUSTOMERS IN REGARD TO THESE REPAIRS.  COST TO PERFORM THE REPAIR WILL RUN BETWEEN $1800 AND $2200 PER QUOTATION BY MY DEALER.  TIMING CHAIN FAILURE WOULD LIKELY CAUSE CATASTROPHIC ENGINE DAMAGE.  SHOULD SUCH FAILURE OCCUR UNDER HIGHWAY CONDITIONS, SERIOUS ACCIDENTS WITH CONCOMITANT INJURIES WOULD LIKELY RESULT.  WHILE I HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT, I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT NISSAN IS TAKING NO ACTION TO ADDRESS THIS POTENTIALLY SERIOUS ISSUE AFFECTING A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THEIR FLEET FOR THESE MODEL YEARS.

THIS WHOLE PROCESS STARTED ON WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2009 WHEN THE NISSAN SERVICE DEPARTMENT FOUND THE ISSUE AND STATED THAT IT SHOULD BE FIXED TO THE AMOUNT OF $1,578.00 (+TAX).  THEY EVEN SENT A \"CPIA - GOODWILL RECOMMENDATION\" REQUEST TO WHICH NISSAN'S MESSAGE BACK WAS \"GOODWILL IS NOT RECOMMENDED\".  AT THAT TIME I EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT IT DID NOT MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME WHY A TIMING CHAIN THAT IS MEANT TO OUTLAST THE LIFE OF THE ENGINE WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED WHEN MY VEHICLE ONLY HAS 76,717 MILES ON IT.  I HAVE ALWAYS ENSURED IT IS WELL MAINTAINED AT THE INTERVALS RECOMMENDED AND I AM A VERY SAFE AND GOOD DRIVER AND KEEP MY VEHICLE IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION, IT IS NOT NEGLECTED IN ANYWAY.  THEY SUGGESTED THAT I PHONE THE NISSAN CUSTOMER CARE LINE TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING FURTHER THAT COULD BE DONE.  AFTER 6 PHONE CALLS WITH NISSAN CUSTOMER CARE THEY TOO DECIDED THAT THEY FELT IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND NOT THEIR PROBLEM.  SO I WENT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND RECEIVED A RECOMMENDATION TO SPEAK WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER.  I SENT HIM A VERY DETAILED EMAIL REQUESTING ASSISTANCE, HE STATED HE'D LOOK INTO MY CONCERNS.  UNFORTUNATELY, HE TOO RECEIVED THE SAME RESPONSE THAT NISSAN FEELS THEY ARE NOT OBLIGATED IN ANYWAY TO REPAIR THE TIMING CHAIN ON MY VEHICLE BECAUSE IT IS OUT OF THE WARRANTY PERIOD.  AT THIS TIME I PLAN TO PURSUE THIS FURTHER BY CONTACTING THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AND LEMON LAW TO SEE IF THEY CAN ASSIST IN ANYWAY.  I BELIEVE THAT IT IS RIDICULOUS FOR THE CONSUMER TO PAY THE COST OF REPLACING A PART THAT SHOULD BE REPLACED BY THE MANUFACTURER SINCE IT IS OBVIOUSLY A DEFECTIVE PART, SINCE IT'S DESIGNED TO OUT LIVE THE LIFE OF THE ENGINE, LAST I CHECKED 76,000+ MILES ON A NISSAN IS NOT THE LIFE OF THE ENGINE.

NOW ON THIS MONTH SEPTEMBER 16, 2008 I WENT TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND FIRST I DID NOT LIKE THE WAY THEY ATTENDED ME, SECOND THEY WANTED ME TO CHARGE ME 100 DOLLARS JUST TO CHECK IF IT WAS THE PROBLEM THAT SAID IN THE PAPER AND IF IT WAS. IT WAS GOING TO BE FREE OR OTHERWISE IF IT CAME WITH SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S WHEN THEY WERE GOING TO CHARGE ME WITH THAT AMOUNT. NOW MY COMPLAIN IS WHY AM I GOING TO PAY 100 . IF IT WAS NOT MY FAULT THAT IT WAS THE MANUFACTURE OF THE CAR. I DID NOT PAID 25 GRAND. FOR NOTHING. NOW I WOULD LIKE THAT PROBLEM TO BE FIX WITHOUT CHARGE BECAUSE IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT THE CAR, CAME OUT WITH A PROBLEM FROM THE COMPANY.

WHILE THERE, I WAS TOLD MY CAR WAS SUBJECT TO A RECALL, THE FIXING OF WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO PREVENT THAT VERY PROBLEM.       THE NEXT DAY, I WAS DRIVING MY CAR AND IT STALLED OUT (WITHOUT THE LIGHT COMING ON), AND I IMMEDIATELY CALLED CROWN'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT AGAIN. I WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WHEN THE RECALL DID NOT ADDRESS THE STALLING, AND IT WAS USUALLY THE CAM AND CRANKSHAFT POSITIONING SENSOR.  I ASKED WHY NISSAN USA DID NOT RECALL THE CAM AND CRANKSHAFT POSITIONING SENSOR, IF THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM. I WAS TOLD THEY HAD NO SAY IN THAT. SO I CALLED NISSAN USA, ALERTED THEM TO THE PROBLEM, AND ASKED THAT THEY OPEN UP A FILE FOR ME, AS I THOUGHT THEY SHOULD RECALL THE CAM SENSOR, IF IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE PROBLEM. AFTER SUBSEQUENT RESEARCH, I DISCOVERED THAT THE CAM /CRANK SHAFT POSITIONING SENSOR WAS RECALLED IN CERTAIN 2002-2003 ALTIMAS.       FINALLY, MY CAR KEPT STALLING UNTIL THE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN.  I TOOK IT TO A DIFFERENT NISSAN DEALERSHIP (DUE TO OTHER ISSUES WITH CROWN).  IT WAS THERE I WAS TOLD THAT THE CAM/CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  WHEN ASKED IF THIS WAS CUSTOMARY, I WAS TOLD THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH ALTIMAS LIKE MINE, FOR WHICH THE RECALL FAILED TO PREVENT THE PROBLEM. AGAIN, I ASKED WHY THIS CAM/CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR WAS NOT RECALLED.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM TO HAVE ON THE ROAD. I WAS TOLD TO TAKE IT UP WITH NISSAN USA.    I CALLED NISSAN USA AND REQUESTED A REFUND, AND ASKED THAT THEY RECALL THE PART. MY CASE WAS ASSIGNED TO A FIELD REP, WHO HAS NEVER CALLED ME. AFTER NO RESPONSE TO MY CALLS, I SENT A LETTER DEMANDING A REFUND AND A RECALL. NO RESPONSE. *TR",

OTHER TIMES THE CAR WOULD STALL COMPLETELY AT LOW SPEEDS, LOOSING POWER TO THE STEERING AND BRAKES PUTTING MYSELF IN A SITUATION HARMFUL TO THOSE STOPPED IN FRONT OF ME.

MY VEHICLE HAD 41,000 MILES ON IT WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THERE WAS NO RECALL YET FOR THE 2005 MODEL ALTHOUGH I EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEMS THE OTHER RECALLS IDENTIFIED.  THE SERVICE PERSONNEL CALLED ME AFTER MY CAR WAS LOOKED AT AND ADVISED THAT THE CAM SHAFT POSITION SENSOR AND THE CRANK SHAFT POSITION SENSOR HAD FAILED DUE TO EXPERIENCING HOT CONDITIONS & THE SOLDER HOLDING THEM IN PLACE MELTED (AGAIN CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUSLY ISSUED TSBS AND RECALLS).

THE RECALL FOR THE 2005 MODEL WAS ISSUED IN DECEMBER 2007 AND I AM TRYING TO GET A REFUND FOR HAVING TO PAY FOR REPAIRS THAT NISSAN IDENTIFIED AS SAFETY-RELATED.  THE RECALL LISTS REPROGRAMMING OF THE ECM, WHICH NEEDED TO BE COMPLETED, SINCE THE ECM WOULD LOOSE COMMUNICATION WITH THE TCM.  HOWEVER THE REASON FOR THE FAILURE IN COMMUNICATION STEMMED FROM THE FAILURE OF THE POSITION SENSORS.  I FEEL LET DOWN AND UPSET THAT NISSAN CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE THESE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR 2.5 LITER ENGINES IN YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO ISSUED RECALLS AND FAILED TO NOTIFY CURRENT OWNERS OF THE SAFETY-RELATED PROBLEMS.

IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU ARE REPLACING A LOT OF CLIPS, THEY ARE NOT DOING THE JOB. IF LOWER ENGINE COVER FALLS DOWN, IT COULD CAUSE A MAJOR ACCIDENT IF THE CAR IS GOING AT A HIGH SPEED.

I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH ON ALTIMA?S 2004 ^ AND FOUND THAT MANY HAVE BEEN HAVING ENGINE PROBLEMS AND HAVE THE SAME SYMPTOMS THAT I AM EXPERIENCING.  ?ON CERTAIN PASSENGER VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH A 2.5L ENGINE, A VARIATION IN TEMPERATURE OCCURS DUE TO THE UNIQUE LOCATION OF THE SENSOR IN THE ENGINE. UNDER CERTAIN DRIVING CONDITIONS, THESE VARIATIONS IN TEMPERATURE CAN BE LARGE ENOUGH TO CAUSE A BRIEF INTERRUPTION IN THE SIGNAL OUTPUT FROM THE SENSOR. IF THE INTERRUPTION IN THE SIGNAL FROM THE SENSOR IS SO BRIEF THAT THE ELECTRONIC CONTROL MODULE (ECM) LOGIC DOES NOT HAVE TIME TO DIAGNOSE THE CONDITION, THE ENGINE MAY STOP RUNNING WITHOUT WARNING WHILE THE VEHICLE IS DRIVEN AT A LOW SPEED INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH.?

NO ACCIDENTS ,AND WAS IN EXCELLENT TO GOOD CONDITION. WHILE DRIVING TO WORK I EXITED THE HIGHWAY AND APPROACHED A TRAFFIC LIGHT. AS I APPROACHED THE LIGHT, THE CAR BEGAN TO JERK AND STALLED. PRIOR TO THE STALL THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CAR AND NO WARNING LIGHTS TO SIGNAL A PROBLEM.  UPON STALLING THE OIL LIGHT CAME ON AND THEN QUICKLY SHUT OFF AGAIN. I TRIED TO START THE CAR. THE CAR STARTED RIGHT AWAY AND BEGAN THE SAME JERKING MOTION. AS I CAME TO THE NEXT LIGHT  I WAS ABLE TO TURN RIGHT AND PULL THE CAR OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD JUST AS THE CAR CAME TO A STALL A SECOND TIME. I CALLED NISSAN. WHILE ON THE PHONE, I NOTICED SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE HOOD OF MY VEHICLE. IN A MATTER OF SECONDS THE SMOKE BECAME DARKER. I REALIZED THAT THE CAR WAS ON FIRE. I EXITED THE VEHICLE. WHILE ON THE PHONE WITH THE 911 OPERATOR,FLAMES CAME OUT OF THE HOOD. OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST THREE AND ONE-HALF WEEKS I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH NISSAN REGARDING THE CAR FIRE AND WARRANTY. NISSAN TOOK TWO WEEKS TO SEND AN ENGINEER  TO LOOK AT THE CAR, AND IT HAS BEEN OVER A WEEK SINCE THE ENGINEER VISITED, AND I STILL HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD WHAT RECOURSE WAS AVAILABLE OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT I MAY HAVE TO GO TO ARBITRATION WITH NISSAN TO SEEK ANY DAMAGES. I HAVE SEEN NOTHING BUT A COMPLETE DISREGARD FOR PROFESSIONALISM AND SERVICE FROM A COMPANY WHICH TOUTED  ITSELF AS A SERVICE-ORIENTED ORGANIZATION. I HOPE THIS COMPLAINT DREW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE NEED FOR A SERIOUS INQUIRY INTO POTENTIAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2005 ALTIMA. CAR FIRES WHICH OCCUR IN NEW VEHICLES  WERE A DANGEROUS MATTER, AND I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT NISSAN HAS NOT DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE IN A MORE APPROPRIATE WAY. EVERYONE INVOLVED WAS FORTUNATE NO ONE WAS INJURED OR KILLED. *AK",

THIS CONCERN MAKES THE VEHICLE UNSAFE TO DRIVE BECAUSE YOU DO NOT HAVE A SENSE OF CONTROL WHEN DRIVING, IN ADDITION WHEN DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THE VIBRATION IN THE WHEEL MAKES YOUR HANDS AND ARMS FALL ASLEEP.  IT IS ALWAYS NECESSARY AFTER AN HOUR OR HOUR AND A HALF TO PULL OVER AND GIVE YOUR ARMS/ HANDS A REST.  THE DEALER ADDRESSED THIS CONCERN BY BALANCING THE WHEELS BY ROAD FORCE BALANCE (CORRECTED SPECS - 21LBS ROAD FORCE DOWN TO 7LBS) NO ALIGNMENT ISSUES WERE NOTICED. AFTER 3 TIPS TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE VIBRATIONS I HAD NOTICED A CLUNK IN THE FRONT END, IT ENDED UP BEING A STRUT THAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  WITH THE NEXT TRIP THE DEALERSHIP THE VIBRATION IN THE STEERING WAS NOW EVIDENT AT ALL SPEEDS, IT WAS STILL DRIFTING, AND A NEW \"HUM\" HAD DEVELOPED AT RANDOM TIMES WHILE DRIVING.  THE DEALER UNABLE TO VERIFY ANY OF MY CONCERNS SUGGESTED THAT I GO FOR A RIDE WITH THE SERVICE MANGER.  AFTER THAT RIDE HE SUGGESTED THAT I HAVE MY TIRES SWAPPED FOR NEW ONES OF ANOTHER BRAND.  ON MY NEXT TRIP TO THE DEALER THEY SWAPPED ALL 4 OF MY TIRES FOR ANOTHER BRAND NAME AND RE-ALIGNED THE FRONT SUSPENSION AND FRONT END.   THROUGHOUT THE WINTER THE CAR RAN OK OTHER THAN SOME ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS THAT WOULD KILL MY BATTERY AND THE REAR PILLAR AIRBAGS COMING OUT.  IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE SPRING THAT I WAS FORCED TO BRING MY CAR DOWN AGAIN FOR THE VIBRATION IN THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE CLUNK IN THE FRONT END.  THE DEALER COULD NOT VERIFY ANY CLUNK IN THE FRONT END BUT AGREED THAT THERE IS AGAIN A VIBRATION AND REMEDIED THE PROBLEM BY ADJUSTING THE STEERING RACK PRE-LOAD. INITIALLY THE VIBRATION WAS REDUCED, BUT WITHIN A MONTH IT WAS BACK. THE SERVICE MANAGER ADMITTED THAT ADJUSTING THE STEERING RACK PRE-LOAD WAS ONLY A \"TEMPORARY FIX\" A \"BANDAID FOR THE PROBLEM\". *JB",

I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER, NO ONE WAS HURT. CALLED NISSAN SAID TIRES WERE NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. SO I WENT TO AN OUTSIDE TIRE DEALER TO HAVE REPLACED, WAS TOLD RIM WAS BENT. AGAIN CALLED NISSAN WAS TOLD THAT WAS MY PROBLEM. SO I PURCHASED A NEW SET OF RIMS. JUST STARTED TO FACE THE FACT THAT I WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE SHAKING AND NOISE. ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO RETURNED TO THE DEALER BECAUSE ALONG WITH THE SHAKING AND NOISE NOW THERE IS A LOUD CLUNKING ON THE RIGHT PASSENGER SIDE. WAS TOLD TIRES NEED TO BE REPLACE, ALIGNMENT AND BALANCE. ALSO GET THIS RIGHT FRONT PASSENGER RIM BENT. AGAIN! SAID IT WAS THE ROADS. TOOK TO TIRE DEALER. RIM WAS BENT. HE DID HIS PART, TOOK IT BACK TO DEALER. THEY HAVE HAD MY CAR MORE TIMES IN THE LAST 2 MONTHS THEN I CARE TO REMIND MYSELF. BUT HAS BEEN NO FIX TO ANY OF MY ISSUES.

AS A TRANSMISSION REPAIR HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN DONE BY NISSAN, I WAS NOT SURE IF THESE TWO EVENTS WERE RELATED OR NOT. I TOLD THE SERVICE ADVISOR, RON ABRAHMSON (3193) THAT IT SOUNDED LIKE A DRIVER'S SIDE BEARING TO ME. INDEED, THAT WAS WHAT WAS FOUND TO BE THE PROBLEM AND IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REPAIRED. THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN, WHO DID THE REPAIR, NOTED THAT MY ALTIMA SHOULD HAVE AN ALIGNMENT DONE. RON CALLED ME AND I TOLD HIM TO GO AHEAD AND HAVE IT DONE WHILE IT WAS THERE.  WHEN I WENT IN TO PICK UP THE CAR, I WAS TOLD THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE WHEEL BEARING HAUPON HEADING OUT FOR HOME, I NOTICED THE GRINDING NOISE AND VIBRATION WERE IMMEDIATELY GONE BUT, THERE WAS STILL A VERY NOTICEABLE HUM OR DRONE WHILE DRIVING. I TURNED AROUND AND WENT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP.  I SPOKE WITH RON, TOLD HIM OF MY CONCERNS AND ASKED HIM TO TAKE A RIDE WITH ME.  WE DROVE SEVERAL MILES AND AT VARIOUS SPEEDS.  HIS CONCLUSION, THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE TIRES.  HE SAID THIS HAS BEEN A COMMON ISSUE/COMPLAINT FROM OTHER ALTIMA OWNERS WITH THIS BRAND OF TIRE AND SUGGESTED THAT MAYBE ROTATING THEM WOULD HELP.  I TOLD RON THAT I WOULD ROTATE THE TIRES AND SEE IF IT HELPED. ON, SATURDAY, JUNE 11TH, I DID JUST THAT.

THE TRUNK LID WOULD NOT STAY UP, WHEN PARKED ON MY DRIVEWAY. ABOUT A 15 DEGREE INCLINE. THE TRUNK LID HAS FALLEN ON ME SEVERAL TIMES BUT I WAS NOT CUT.    I CONTACTED THE COOPER SERVICE DEPT AND THEY ORDERED NEW TORSION BARS. AFTER THEY WERE INSTALLED IT APPEARED TO WORK.     ON 8/14/04 I WASHING VACUUMING OUT MY TRUNK.
