I WAS RIDING AT ABOUT 40 MPH WHEN THE TIRE POPPED.  THE CENTER OF THE TREAD SEPARATED CAUSING THE RAPID DEFLATION.  I HAD THE BIKE TOWED ON A FLAT BED TO EUROPEAN MOTORSPORTS INC. AND BOUGHT A NEW PIRELLI ROSSO 2 TIRE FOR $168.33.  THE FLAT BED TOW COST ME $110.  THE TIRE WAS A CONTI SPORT ATTACK SIZE 120/70ZR17 MOTORCYCLE TIRE.  I FOUND OUT ON APRIL 21, 2016 THAT CONTINENTAL HAS A RECALL ON THIS TIRE FOR RAPID DEFLATION BECAUSE OF TREAD SEPARATION - THE RECALL NOTICE FROM CONTI IS PSIB 14-06 DATED NOVEMBER 6, 2014. I CALLED CONTINENTAL AND TALKED TO JANET DECANDIA AT 973-471-8890 EMAIL = JANET.DECANDIA@CONTI-NA.COM.  JANET TOLD ME I HAD NO RECOURSE BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE THE TIRE CARCASS OR THE DOT SERIAL NUMBER.  I FOUND THE DOT SERIAL NUMBER FROM AN OLD PICTURE AND ON MAY 19, 2016 I SENT HER VIA EMAIL ALL REQUIRED INFORMATION PROVING BIKE YEAR, MODEL, VIN # AND PROOF OF CURRENT OWNERSHIP.  ON MAY 20, 2016 JANET SENT ME AN EMAIL TELLING ME \"I WENT THRU ALL YOUR DOCS AS WELL AS CHECKING THE BMW WEBSITE FOR THE OE FITMENT ON YOUR BIKE, AND ALSO THE LIST OF VIN'S WE RECEIVED FROM BMW THAT WERE EFFECTED BY THE RECALL.  YOUR BIKE DID NOT HAVE A RECALLED TIRE ON IT.  THE OE FITMENT ON YOUR BIKE WAS OUR 120/70ZR17 SPORT ATTACK \"C\", WHEREAS THE RECALLED TIRE DID NOT HAVE THE \"C\" DESIGNATION.  ALSO, THERE WERE NO MODEL YEAR 2009 1300S BIKES ON THE VIN LIST BMW PROVIDED TO US.\".    IF THE SPORT ATTACK \"C\" TIRE THAT POPPED WAS NOT A PART OF THE CONTI RECALL, IT SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE RECALL IMMEDIATELY.  IT IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED BECAUSE OF THAT TIRE'S FAULTY DESIGN OR MANUFACTURE.",

AS OF YET THIS HAS NOT CAUSED ME A SPECIFIC SAFETY ISSUE, BUT THE POTENTIAL IS CERTAINLY THERE. I ADDRESSED THE ISSUE WITH THE BMW DEALERSHIP I PURCHASED IT FROM, BOB'S BMW OR LAUREL, MARYLAND.
