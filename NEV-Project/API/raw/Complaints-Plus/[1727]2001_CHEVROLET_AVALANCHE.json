THE MOST RECENT OCCURRENCE WAS TURNING IN TRAFFIC CAUSING ME TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH THE VEHICLE NOT RUNNING.  SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO RESTART THE VEHICLE WORKED, BUT ONLY RESULTING IN THE VEHICLE STALLING AGAIN, OR RUNNING TILL THE VEHICLE WAS PUT IN DRIVE, WHICH AGAIN IT STALLED.  IT WAS SEVERAL MINUTES TILL I WAS ABLE TO KEEP THE VEHICLE RUNNING.  THE VEHICLE HAS ALWAYS RESTARTED RIGHT AWAY WITHOUT PROBLEM, UNTIL THIS LAST OCCURRENCE.  I HAVE NOT INFORMED THE DEALER AS OF YET, SO NO ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN REGARDING THIS.  *JB",
