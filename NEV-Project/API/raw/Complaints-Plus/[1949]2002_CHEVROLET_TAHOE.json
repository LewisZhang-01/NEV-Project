I THOUGHT IT WAS ODD THAT THE PARKING BRAKES NEED TO BE FIXED CONSIDERING I HAVE NEVER USED THEM BEFORE. THE DEALERSHIP FINISHED UP WITH THE CAR AND WHEN I GOT IT BACK, I BEGAN TO NOTICE SOME TUGGING GOING ON WHEN I WOULD BE DRIVING THROUGH TOWN OR ANYWHERE REALLY.

IT WAS THEN THAT I READ THE PARKING BRAKES FOR THIS MODEL WERE SOMEHOW RECEIVING SOME TYPE OF CONTACT THAT CAUSED THEM TO WEAR DOWN VERY RAPIDLY. I PROCEEDED TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE MANUAL ON HOW TO SET THE PARKING BRAKE, CONSIDERING I HAD NEVER USED IT, AND WHEN I FINISHED ALL THE STEPS REQUIRED, MY CAR PROCEEDED TO ROLL BACKWARDS DOWN THE VERY SLIGHT INCLINE. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND BROUGHT THE CAR BACK IN FOR THEM TO LOOK AT IT. TURNS OUT, I NEED NEW HUBS ALONG WITH A NEW SET OF PARKING BRAKE PADS AND A FEW OTHER THINGS IN ORDER FOR THE PROBLEM TO BE CORRECTED. IT ANGERS ME THAT GM HAS NOT ISSUED ANY SORT OF STATEMENT TO OWNERS INFORMING THEM ABOUT THE ISSUE. NOR HAVE THEY ISSUED ANY SORT OF RECALL ON THE MATTER.

WAS ADVISED BY THE INSPECTOR THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM IN THE TAHOE AND OTHER GM SUVS DUE TO A POOR DESIGN OF THE PARKING BRAKE SHOE ATTACHMENT.  SINCE THE PARKING BRAKE DID NOT FUNCTION AT ALL, IT INDICATED THAT BOTH PARKING BRAKE SHOES WERE NOT FUNCTIONING.       AS EXPLAINED BY THE INSPECTOR:  THE ATTACHMENT POINT FAILS EASILY ALLOWING THE PARKING BRAKE SHOE TO DROP DOWN AND COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE ROTOR, WHICH THEN RENDERS THE PARKING BRAKE USELESS.   IF NOT CAUGHT RELATIVELY SOON, THE PAD WILL BE WORN OFF FROM CONTACT WITH THE ROTOR AND THE UNDERLYING METAL OF THE SHOE CAN DAMAGE THE ROTOR.    BOTH PARKING BRAKE SHOES WERE DETACHED AND THE  MINIMUM COST WAS $120 IF THE SHOES ONLY NEEDED RE-ATTACHMENT, HOWEVER SINCE BOTH PADS WERE WORN FROM RUBBING THE ROTORS THE COST TO REPAIR WAS QUOTED AS $250.  A SECOND ESTIMATE WAS $300.  ACTUAL COST OF REPAIR WAS $234.43.  THE SECOND REPAIR SHOP THAT QUOTED $300, ALSO STATED THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH GM SUVS.    THE INSPECTOR TOLD US THAT GM IS AWARE OF THIS DEFECT, BUT HAS CHOSEN TO DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.

THEY REPLACED THE FILTER, PERFORMED A VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE TRANSMISSION AND REPLACED 4.5 QUARTS OF TRANSMISSION FLUID THAT WAS REMOVED FOR FILTER REPLACEMENT. I PICKED-UP MY SUV AND DROVE IT HOME. THERE WAS A SLIGHT DELAY IN SHIFTING, BUT THIS WAS ONLY NOTICEABLE INTERMITTENTLY.  THE NEXT DAY, I WAS LEAVING ON A FAMILY CAMPING TRIP AND MY TRANSMISSION WENT OUT APPROXIMATELY 1/4 OF A MILE FROM HOME. WE WERE MAKING A RIGHT TURN AND I HEARD A LOUD \"CLUNK\" WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY A SPINNING OR HIGH RPM WINDING SOUND. SINCE WE WERE ABOUT TO START DOWN A STEEP HILL, I TRIED TO TURN AROUND. AS I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING A Y-TURN, I PUT THE CAR INTO REVERSE. I HAD LOST MY REVERSE GEAR, SO I WAS UNABLE TO COMPLETE THE TURN. THIS LEFT MY CAR STRANDED IN THE LANE OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. FEARING FOR MY FAMILIES SAFETY,I PUT THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL AND PUSHED THE CAR FORWARD INTO A DRIVEWAY TO PREVENT BLOCKING THE LANE. I HAD MY TAHOE TOWED BACK TO THE CARL CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP.     THE TRANSMISSION TECH STATED THAT THE SUN SHELL GEAR HAD WORN OUT AND CAUSED THE TRANSMISSION TO FAIL. HE ALSO STATED THAT THERE WAS NO CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PREVIOUS DAY'S SERVICE AND THE TRANSMISSION FAILURE THE FOLLOWING DAY. THE SERVICE MANAGER STATED THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 4L60E TRANSMISSIONS THAT ARE STANDARD EQUIPMENT IN THE TAHOES. THE TRANSMISSION TECH ALSO STATED THAT THE CHEVROLET DISTRIBUTED A TECHNICAL BULLETIN WITHIN THE COMPANY ADVISING THE MECHANICS THAT THE SUN SHELL GEAR WAS FAULTY DUE TO A LACK OF PROPER HEAT TREATING. CHEVY HAS BEEN AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM SINCE THE YEAR 2000. I ASKED CHEVY CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND THEY OFFERED TO PAY 10% OF THE BILL. MY FAMILY WAS PUT AT RISK DUE TO THIS KNOWN PART DEFECT IN THE TRANSMISSION.  *JB",

THERE IS A BUMP IN THE ROAD APPROX. 30 FEET FROM THE STOP SIGN - ALMOST EVERY TIME I HIT THIS BUMP, WITH THE BRAKE ALREADY ENGAGED - THE BRAKE SYSTEM \"DISENGAGES\" WHEN I HIT THE BUMP AND I HAVE TO FRANTICALLY PUSH THE BRAKE AGAIN TO TRY TO STOP THE VEHICLE.  A FEW TIMES I HAVE ENDED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET BEFORE THE BRAKE ENGAGES.  IT IS ONLY PURE LUCK THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN HIT OR KILLED.  I KNOW NOW TO AVOID THIS STREET , BUT IT HAPPENS APPROX. 5 TO 10 TIMES A MONTH AT DIFFERENT TIMES, WEATHER CONDITIONS, ROAD SURFACES, ETC.  I AM UTTERLY PARANOID ABOUT THIS AND DRIVE VERY CAUTIOUSLY - IT IS ONLY FOR THAT REASON THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT.  IN MAY OF 2005 I FINALLY INSISTED ON REPLACING THE BRAKES AT MY OWN EXPENSE, YET THIS HASN'T SOLVED THE PROBLEM.  THE EMERGENCY BRAKE PROBLEM IS HORRIBLE.  THIS STARTED AS SOON AS THE BRAKES WERE REPLACED IN MAY 2005- IT STARTED STICKING ONCE IN A WHILE AND WORKED ITS WAY UP TO A FEW TIMES A DAY.  THE EMERGENCY BRAKE WAS REPLACED IN APRIL OF 2006 YET THIS SOLVED NOTHING, THE PROBLEM IS JUST AS BAD IF NOT WORSE NOW.

THERE WERE CARS COMING BEHIND ME, BUT THERE WAS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR A PROPER ACCELERATION TO CRUISING SPEED WITHOUT IN-CONVINCING THE OTHER DRIVERS.

LUCKILY THERE WAS ENOUGH SHOULDER AND ENOUGH TIME TO GET OUT OF TRAFFIC AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.

HOWEVER, AT 34,000 MILES (NOVEMBER OF 2004) THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT. MY WIFE WAS DRIVING TO WORK AND NEEDED TO ACCELERATE TO MERGE ONTO THE FREEWAY AND INSTANTLY THE TRANSMISSION BEGAN TO WHINE AND STOPPED OPERATING WHICH PLACED HER INTO THE PATH OF A LARGE TRUCK BEARING DOWN ON HER RATHER QUICKLY. THANKFULLY SHE WAS ABLE TO GLIDE OUT OF THE PATH OF THE TRUCK TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. WE HAD THE TAHOE TOWED BACK TO OUR DEALERSHIP AND WE DETERMINED THAT THE TRANSMISSION \"SUN SHELL\" HAD FAILED AND WOULD BE REPLACED. OUR DEALER ASSURED US THAT THIS WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM, BECAUSE THE NEW PARTS WERE DESIGNED TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE. OUR DEALER FURTHER STATED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN REPAIRING A LARGE NUMBER OF VEHICLES WITH THESE FAILURES.   OUR TAHOE WENT OFF OF IT'S NEW CAR WARRANTY ON MILEAGE NOT NUMBER OF MONTHS SOMETIME IN APRIL OF 2005 (36 MONTHS WOULD HAVE ENDED THIS AUGUST). JUST THIS PAST MONDAY (SEPTEMBER 19, 2005) MY WIFE WAS AGAIN ON HER WAY TO WORK WHEN AGAIN THE TRANSMISSION FAILED IN OUR 2002 TAHOE. THE MILEAGE WAS APPROX: 41,000 ( TOTAL PERIOD OF MILES AND THE LENGTH OF TIME FROM THE PREVIOUS FAILURE WAS APPROX: 7 MONTHS). THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE THE SAME, SHE WAS ACCELERATING TO MERGE ONTO THE FREEWAY AND AGAIN THE TRANSMISSION BEGAN TO WHINE AND SLIP. THIS TIME SHE WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE DRIVING TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND RELATIVE SAFETY. WE HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED BACK TO OUR DEALERSHIP AND AGAIN THE DEALER ADVISED THAT THE \"SUN SHELL\" HAD FAILED. I WENT TO PICK UP THE CAR ON FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 23, 2005 AND WHILE I WAS AT THE DEALERSHIP THE MECHANIC SHOWED ME THE DAMAGED PART AND A BENCH THAT CONTAINED SEVERAL DAMAGED \"SUN SHELL\". IT OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT TAKE MUCH EFFORT TO REALIZE THAT THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW WITH THIS PARTICULAR TRANSMISSION AND SPECIFICALLY THIS PART. *JB",

I WAS TOLD TO BRING THE TRUCK BACK MONDAY.  I EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT I HAD TO GET IT JUMP-STARTED TO GET HERE.

I WAS ASKED HOW MANY MILES WERE ON MY TRUCK, I TOLD THEM 53,000 I WAS TOLD BY MARK, THAT THE WARRANTY WAS OFF.    HE TOLD ME THAT THE BATTERY WAS ONLY COVERED WITH A 3 YEAR OR 36,000 MILES.  HE STATED THAT IF I HAD PURCHASED THE BATTERY MYSELF, HE COULD ADJUST, BUT SINCE IT CAME AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE, THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO.  I LEFT GOING TO AUTO ZONE AND HAD THE BATTERY TESTED, HE (THE SALESMAN), STATED THAT IT SHOWED THE BATTERY WAS GOOD.  THE  DOT ON TOP OF THE BATTERY WAS GREEN, BUT WHEN I WENT TO LEAVE, MY TRUCK WOULDN'T START. SO I PURCHASED A NEW  BATTERY AND  MY TRUCK STARTED RIGHT UP.

HE CARRIED IT TO YAZOO MOTORS AND HE WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD COST HIM $115.00 FOR THE BATTERY AND $35.00 TO INSTALL, THIS WAS DUE TO THE BATTERY BEING LOCATED UNDER THE BACK SEAT.  HIS BATTERY WAS ALSO A DELCO WITH A 6 YEAR WARRANTY.  NO LIGHT NEVER CAME ON HIS MESSAGE CENTER TO ADVISE HIM THAT THE BATTERY WAS GOING OUT.  MY QUESTION:  HAVE THERE BEEN ANY COMPLAINTS ON THE DELCO BATTERIES PUT IN TO THE 2002 GENERAL MOTORS PRODUCTS?

I TOOK THE TAHOE BACK TO BROWN AND BROWN THE NEXT DAY.  THEY FOUND THAT THE EMERGENCY BRAKE HAD BEEN STUCK ON THE BRAKES FOR MONTHS, AND FINALLY BURNED UP. THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED, UNDER WARRANTY, BUT WITH NO APOLOGIES FROM CHEVY.  UNFORTUNEATELY, I HAD ALREADY RECEIVED COMPENSATION FROM CHEVY FOR OTHER ISSUES RELATING TO THIS TAHOE.

IN ADDITION, THE FUEL GAUGE SENSOR AND THE AIR CONDITIONER COMPRESSOR  HAVE HAD TO BE REPLACED.  APPROXIMATELY 6 WEEKS AGO, WHILE ON VACATION, THE TAHOE DIED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. WE WERE 3 HOURS FROM HOME, SO WE HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP AND RENT AN AUTOMOBILE TO CONTINUE ON OUR TRIP. THE NEXT DAY WE HAD TO GO BACK TO THIS DEALERSHIP TO PICK UP THE TAHOE. WE WERE TOLD THAT THE FUEL PUMP CONNECTOR WIRES HAD WORKED LOOSE. LAST WEEKEND, WHILE DRIVING AT 55 MPH, IT DIED AGAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. WE HAD IT TOWED TO OUR LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND HAVE HAD TO REPLACE YET ANOTHER FUEL PUMP.  EVERY TIME THE FUEL PUMP WENT OUT, THE TAHOE WAS BEING DRIVEN IN TRAFFIC. TO HAVE A VEHICLE DIE SUDDENLY AT 55 MPH IN TRAFFIC IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION.  WE CONTACTED GM BACK IN MAY AFTER PUTTING OUR VEHICLE IN THE SHOP FOR A NEW AIR CONDITIONER COMPRESSOR. AFTER MANY LENGTHY DISCUSSIONS WITH A GM CUSTOMER REP, WE WERE GIVEN AN EXTENDED WARRANTY.   WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY, THE PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED. APPARENTLY THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH OUR VEHICLE AND/OR THE FUEL PUMPS THEMSELVES THAT ARE CAUSING THIS REPEATED FAILURE.  IT HAS BECOME A SAFETY ISSUE. NOW WE FEEL THAT WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GET RID OF OUR VEHICLE. HOWEVER, BY TRADING IT IN, ALL WE'RE DOING IS PASSING THE PROBLEM ON TO THE NEXT UNLUCKY SOUL. WE CAN'T, IN GOOD CONSCIENCE, SELL THE CAR TO SOMEONE WITHOUT TELLING THEM ALL THE PROBLEMS WE'VE EXPERIENCED. ONLY A FOOL WOULD BUY IT FROM US.

THE VEHICLES WERE INVOLVED IN DRIVER SIDE OFF SET IMPACTS THAT LEAD TO INTRUSION INTO THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. THE VEHICLES WERE A 2002 4X4 AVALANCHE, 2001 EXT.

I DID LOOK AT THE TAHOE ENGINE AND IT APPERED THAT THE BATTERY CABLE HAD BEEN SEVERED IN THE CRASH.

THE BURS WERE FALLING OFF OF THE VALVE BODY AND INTO THE TRANSMISSION FLUID CAUSING A BLOCKAGE WHICH CAUSED THE PROBLEM.  THEY REPLACED THE VALVE BODY.
