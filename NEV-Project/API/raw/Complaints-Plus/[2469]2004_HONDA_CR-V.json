IN APRIL 2014, THE SRS LIGHT WITH THE DTC 15-2 CODE CAME ON PERMANENTLY AND WOULD NOT CLEAR WITH MY CODE READER.  THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO THE HONDA DEALER ON 5/27/2014.  THE MILEAGE WAS 121,133.  THE HONDA TECH DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A FAILED PRINTED CIRCUIT IN THE DASHBOARD GAUGE CONTROL MODULE AFTER BEING UNABLE TO CLEAR THE SRS DIAGNOSTIC CODE.  A NEW GAUGE CONTROL MODULE WAS INSTALLED ON 6/16/2014.  I RETAINED THE OLD PART.  SO FAR THE SRS DASHBOARD LIGHT HAS NOT COME BACK ON PERMANENTLY AGAIN.  UPDATED 08/18/14",

MY CAR THEN WENT OUT OF CONTROL AND I TRIED MY BEST TO CONTROL IT. I DID MANAGE TO KEEP MY CAR FROM ROLLING. MY CAR WAS GOING BACK AND FORTH ON 2 WHEELS ON THE DRIVERS SIDE AND THE PASSENGERS SIDE. I WAS ALSO SPINNING AND FISHTAILING AND THE BACK END OF MY CR-V (PASSENGER SIDE) HIT THE BACK END OF THE DRIVER SIDE OF A SEDAN IN THE #3 OR #4 LANE.

I HIT THE CENTER DIVIDER HEAD ON AND WENT UP AND IT FELT LIKE I WAS GOING TO GO OVER IT ONTO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FREEWAY BUT MY CR-V CAME BACK DOWN RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE CENTER DIVIDER WITH THE SMASHED UP BUMPER FACING THE CENTER DIVIDER.

I BOUGHT THE CAR NEW IN 2004.  I HAD NO PROBLEM FOR A YEAR.  THEN SUDDENLY THE GAS OVERFLOWED ONE DAY WHEN FILLING THE TANK.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP IMMEDIATELY.  THEY COULDN'T REPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.      OVER THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS THE GAS OVERFLOWED SPORADICALLY, PROBABLY 3 OR 4 TIMES OVER FIVE YEARS.  I ALMOST ALWAYS USE MARATHON GAS.  I DON'T OVERFILL THE TANK.  WHEN THE PUMP CLICKS OFF, I TYPICALLY WAIT A SECOND, AND THEN REMOVE THE NOZZLE.  I WILL PUT THE NOZZLE BACK ON THE PUMP AND THEN TURN TO PUT THE GAS CAP ON, AND SPORADICALLY, I FIND THE GAS LITERALLY FOUNTAINING OUT OF THE TANK.    IN JUNE OR JULY 2009, IT HAPPENED AGAIN ON A VERY HOT DAY AND I WAS EXTREMELY CONCERNED.  I DROVE IMMEDIATELY TO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN AND THIS TIME THEY INFORMED ME THAT A VALVE, INTEGRAL TO THE GAS TANK, HAD GONE BAD AND THAT THE ENTIRE TANK WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED.  THAT WAS DONE.    ALL WAS FINE FOR THE NEXT 20 MONTHS.  BUT JUST LAST WEEK, THE SAME PROBLEM HAPPENED AGAIN.  I AM VERY, VERY CONCERNED ABOUT A POSSIBLE FIREBALL HAPPENING BECAUSE THE GASOLINE FOUNTAINS OUT OF THE TANK, RUNS DOWN THE SIDE OF THE CAR, HITTING THE TIRES AND BRAKES, AND THEN POOLS ONTO THE GROUND.  I'VE HAD PROBABLY A HALF LITER OF GASOLINE FOUNTAIN OUT LIKE THAT.    PLEASE LOOK AT THE OTHER COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE BEEN FILED.  THIS IS TRULY A SAFETY HAZARD.  I AM BEGINNING TO THINK IT WOULD BE SAFER FOR ME TO HAVE MY CHILD OUTSIDE OF THE CAR WHEN REFUELING THIS VEHICLE.  IT'S TRULY SCARY WHEN IT HAPPENS.    THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LOOKING INTO THIS PROBLEM.  I AM WAITING FOR HONDA'S RESOLUTION AND REPAIR NOW.  *TR",

TO ADD TO MY FRUSTRATION, THE CR-V WAS GIVEN A 60,000 MILE SERVICE IN THE AMOUNT OF $955.76 AT 56,050 MILES TO GUARD AGAINST SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENING. AT THE 60, 000 MILE SERVICE ALONG WITH ALL THE REGULAR SERVICE, THE COMPLETE COOLING SYSTEM WAS CLEANED AND FLUSHED WITH STATE OF THE ART EQUIPMENT REMOVING OLD CONTAMINATED COOLANT, REPLACING WITH NEW COOLANT, ADDING A WATER PUMP, LUBRICANT, CORROSION CONTROL AND A SYSTEM SEALER . AT 58,000 MILES THE  AIR COMPRESSOR BLOWING UP, I WAS 900 MILES FROM HOME TRANSPORTING TWO ELDERLY RELATIVES IN 110 DEGREE HEAT IN JULY IN OKLAHOMA.  BY THE TIME WE REACHED THE NEXT AVAILABLE CITY, WE WERE ALL WIND-BURNED FROM THE INTENSE HEAT  DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE WERE DRIVING WITH THE WINDOWS PARTIALLY DOWN AND AT A MUCH SLOWER SPEED.  IN THE END AND SINCE THE FLYING PARTS OF THE COMPRESSOR HAD GONE EVERYWHERE, I PARTED WITH $1,805.20 AT 58,154 MILES FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE AIR COMPRESSOR, CLUTCH, COIL, CONDENSER AND, OF COURSE, THE COST FOR EVACUATION AND RECHARGING OF THE A/C SYSTEM AGAIN.  THIS DOES SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM FOR HONDA SINCE WHOEVER IS SUPPLYING COMPRESSORS FOR THEIR AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM IS NOT MEETING SAFETY STANDARDS.  IT IS APPARENT FROM MY EXPERIENCE, THE COMPRESSOR BEARING(S) FROZEN CAUSING THE COMPRESSOR TO JAM AND THE HOUSING TO OVERHEAT AND BLOW APART.  THESE FLYING PARTS CAN GO ANYWHERE CAUSING MORE PROPERTY DAMAGE AND ADDITIONAL COST BEYOND JUST REPLACING THE COMPRESSOR ($542.78 PLUS LABOR); AND WHEN THESE COMPRESSOR PARTS ARE SPREAD ACROSS HEAVILY TRAVELED HIGHWAYS, THEY COULD CAUSE A TIRE BLOW-OUTS CONTRIBUTING TO A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  *TR",

WITHIN 2-3 MILES AT A SPEED OF 60 MPH, THE CAR HOOD SUDDENLY FLEW UP AND CRASHED INTO THE WINDSHIELD COMPLETELY OBSCURING MY VIEW.  BECAUSE IT WAS DAYLIGHT AND TRAFFIC WAS LIGHT, I WAS ABLE TO MOVE THE CAR OFF THE HIGHWAY WITHOUT INCIDENT.  A POLICE OFFICER STOPPED TO INQUIRE, BUT THERE WAS NO NEED TO FILE A REPORT.    3.  UNDRIVABLE, THE CRV WAS TOWED TO A BODY SHOP, WHERE THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE HOOD PROP ROD WAS INSERTED INTO THE HOOD LATCH, PREVENTING THE HOOD FROM LATCHING, THUS CAUSING THE ACCIDENT.  DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE INCLUDED THE HOOD, ROOF AND WINDSHIELD, ALL REPLACED BY THE BODY SHOP AT MY EXPENSE.      HERE ARE THE ISSUES:    A.  THE DESIGN OF THE 2004 CRV HOOD PROP ROD IS DEFECTIVE.  IT IS VERY EASY TO MISTAKENLY INSERT IT INTO THE HOOD LATCH, WHICH IS LOCATED LESS THAN AN INCH FROM THE ROD.  I TRIED THE SAME MANEUVER ON OUR 2004 HONDA ACCORD, BUT THE PROP ROD IS LOCATED FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE LATCH NOT TO TOUCH IT AT ALL.    B.  HONDA HAS MADE ITS REPUTATION AS A MANUFACTURER OF SAFE VEHICLES.  THAT IS WHY I OWN TWO.  HOWEVER, THE HONDA CRV DOES NOT HAVE A WARNING SYSTEM TO INDICATE IF THE HOOD IS UNLATCHED.  IN THIS CASE, THOUGH BOTH THE HOOD LATCH AND SAFETY CATCH WERE UNLATCHED, I WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF IT AND WAS PLACED IN A SITUATION THAT JEOPARDIZED MY LIFE.  THIS SITUATION COULD EASILY BE REMEDIED BY REDESIGNING THE ROD AND INSTALLING A WARNING LIGHT IN THE DASH SIMILAR TO THOSE INDICATING UNLATCHED TRUNKS AND DOORS.      *JB",

THE FIRST THING THAT CAME TO MIND WAS \"THIS POOR GUY'S CAR IS GOING TO CATCH ON FIRE\".   IMAGINE MY SURPRISE WHEN I DID A SEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT HONDA CRVS ARE BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE NHTSA FOR MYSTERIOUS FIRES.  TTP://MOTORTREND.COM/FEATURES/NEWS/112_NEWS18/.  THE REASON WHY HONDA SUVS CATCH ON FIRE IS BECAUSE OF INCREDIBLY HIGH EXHAUST GAS TEMPERATURES THAT CAUSE IN THE MANIFOLD COLLECTOR AND EXHAUST PIPE OF THE VEHICLE TO GLOW CHERRY RED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  SOMETHING IN THE ENGINE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM IS AMISS CAUSING EITHER INCREDIBLY LEAN MIXTURES THAT RAISE EXHAUST GAS TEMPERATURES, OR OVERLY RETARDED TIMING THAT IS LETTING EXCESS FUEL BURN IN EXHAUST SYSTEM INSTEAD OF THE ENGINE.   EITHER WAY, IT IS A DISASTEROUS PROBLEM BASED ON WHAT I SAW.
