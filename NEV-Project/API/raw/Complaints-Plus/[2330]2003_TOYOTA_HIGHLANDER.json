THE HIGHLANDER STARTED TO SLOW DOWN I THEN TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND THEN CAME TO A STOP.  I WAITED FOR A MINUTE AND STARTED THE CAR THE ENGINE RACED AT A HIGH RPMS AS IF MY FOOT WAS PUSHED ALL THE WAY DOWN ON THE ACCELERATOR, BUT MY FOOT WAS NOT ON THE GAS PEDAL.  I WAITED AGAIN A FEW MINUTES TO START THE HIGHLANDER , THE SAME HIGH RPMS HAPPENING AGAIN.  A FEW MINUTES LATER I TRIED AGAIN TO START THE HIGHLANDER AND THIS TIME THE HIGHLANDER IDLED NORMAL.

THIS WOULD INCLUDE:OIL CHANGES, NEW BRAKES, NEW TIRES, REPAIRS OF BELTS/FILTERS ETC, HOSES, TUNE UPS, GREAT GAS AND CAR WASHES/BODY CARE. MOST OF THIS HAS BEEN DONE BY THE DEALERSHIP HERE IN CULVER CITY CA. I'VE DEPENDED ON THEM TO TELL ME WHAT WAS GOOD/BAD ABOUT MY CAR AND TRUSTED THEM  IN DOING SO. I ALSO MADE SURE TO DO THE REPAIRS THEY SUGGESTED. SOMETIMES HOWEVER THEY SAID IT WAS FINE, BUT WOULD COME TO FIND OUT, I DID HAVE ISSUES. THIS MADE ME WONDER IF TOYOTA WAS TRUSTWORTHY/DOING THEIR JOBS RIGHT AND NOW I FEEL THE SAME LACK OF TRUST IN MY CARS PERFORMANCE /CURRENT STATE. I CAN SAY I HAVE ONLY PUT 50,000 MILES OR SO  ON MY CAR IN THE LAST 8 YEARS, AND I KNOW TOYOTAS CAN/SHOULD LAST UNTIL 250,000 OR SO, WITHOUT MAJOR ISSUES. HOWEVER SINCE 2015 I HAVE DEALT, WITH ONE THING AFTER THE NEXT WITH THE CAR. MOST RECENTLY THIS PAST WEEKEND WHERE MY ENGINE COMPLETELY BLEW. HOW COULD A ENGINE BLOW OUT ON SUCH A WELL MAINTAINED CAR? WELL AFTER REVIEWING OTHER COMPLAINTS ONLINE, IT SEEMS THIS YEAR AND MODEL HAS THIS PROBLEM OFTEN, ONCE THEY REACH AROUND 110,000 MARK OR SO. WHY? IT SEEMS TO BE A FAULTY ENGINE /SOMETHING THAT SHOULD DEFINITELY BE RECALLED. WE AS CONSUMERS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SPEND THOUSANDS ON A CAR, THOUSANDS TO KEEP IT IN GREAT CONDITION AND THEN THOUSANDS WHEN ARE ENGINES FAIL AND THIS HAS BEEN REPORTED. OTHER MAY SIMPLY THINK THERE IS NO HOPE AND DON'T BOTHER. BUT I AM BOTHERED, BECAUSE NOW I AM WITHOUT A CAR. I DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS FOR THIS REPAIR.

AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES, I RESTARTED THE CAR AND NOTICED THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE HAD RETURNED TO ITS NORMAL POSITION. I RE-ENTERED THE HIGHWAY AND WAS ONLY ABLE TO DRIVE FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES BEFORE I NOTICED THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE BEGIN TO RISE ONCE AGAIN. I EXITED THE HIGHWAY AND FOUND A CANADIAN TIRE STORE IN LONDON, ON, CANADA WHERE A MECHANIC LOOKED AT THE VEHICLE AND CONCLUDED THAT THERE WAS SOME SORT OF LEAK IN THE ENGINE. I WAS TOLD THAT IT COULD BE ONE OF TWO VERY UNCOMMON PROBLEMS THAT WOULD BOTH COST A GREAT AMOUNT OF MONEY TO FIX AND WOULD MOST LIKELY EXTEND MY FAMILY'S STAY IN CANADA. WE WERE TOLD THAT WE COULD STAY IN LONDON AND HAVE A MECHANIC BEGIN WORKING ON THE VEHICLE THE NEXT DAY OR CONTINUE ON TO HAMILTON BY STOPPING EVERY FEW MILES TO REFILL THE COOLANT, AS WE WERE ONLY ABOUT AN HOUR AWAY. WE DECIDED TO CONTINUE ON TO HAMILTON AND STOPPED AROUND 5 TIMES TO REFILL THE COOLANT LEVEL. UPON REACHING HAMILTON, ON, CANADA WE FOUND A LOCAL MECHANIC WHO TOOK A CLOSER LOOK AT THE VEHICLE AND ITS ENGINE. WE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO HIM ON FRIDAY, JULY 6, 2012 AND HE TOLD US THAT IT LOOKED LIKE AN INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET LEAK. ON SATURDAY, JULY 7, 2012 THE MECHANIC INFORMED US THAT THE LEAK WAS IN FACT COMING FROM ONE OF THE 4 CYLINDER HEADS AS THE BOLTS ON THE ENGINE WERE STRIPPED. OUR ONLY OPTION WAS TO COMPLETELY REPLACE THE ENGINE. THE MECHANIC WAS ABLE TO FIND A MATCHING ENGINE NEARBY AND COMPLETED THE REPLACEMENT BY TUESDAY, JULY 10, 2012.

SERVICE MANAGER SLIPPED UP BY SAYING THIS IS A DEFECT IN THE ENGINE BUT WHEN QUESTIONED FURTHER ABOUT THE PROBLEM HE STATED HE ONLY SEES IT \"ONCE IN A BLUE MOON\".  THIS SEEMS TO BE A CONTRADICTION TO ALL THE OTHER SIMILAR COMPLAINTS FOR THIS 4 CYLINDER ENGINE.  TOYOTA ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN MARCH 2, 2011 FOR THE HIGHLANDER, RAV4, CAMRY, AND SOLARA WHICH STATES: THERE MAY BE DAMAGED CYLINDER HEAD BOLTS.

I CALLED TOYOTA NATIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY GAVE ME THIS WEBSITE INFORMATION TO FILE A COMPLAINT (I HAVE A CLAIM NUMBER IF YOU NEED IT).

THE ONLY FIX PER DEALERSHIP DETERMINED TO BE A BRAND NEW SHORT ENGINE BLOCK AND ACCESSORY REPLACEMENT FOR $6,470.  DATE ON THIS IS AUGUST/2010.    HAVE ALL PAST SERVICE HISTORY OIL CHANGES/TRANSMISSION CHANGES, RADIATOR CHANGES, WATER PUMP SERVICE, ETC FROM 0 MILES TO CURRENT.    TOLD THAT THE SCREWS WERE NEVER SPRAYED AND SEALED CORRECTLY, THUS CORRODED INTO THE THREADS AND CAUSED FAILURE WITH BOTH ITEMS.

I TRIED TO GET THE LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP TO REPACE THE VISOR UNDER MY EXTENDED WARRANTY BUT WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS NOT COVERED BY IT. AFTER READING MANY POSTINGS ON THE WEB IT SEEMS THAT MANY TOYOTA HIGHLANDER OWNERS HAVE THIS SAME PROBLEM. MY VISOR HAS BUILT IN ELECTRICAL PARTS ON IT THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO CONTROL A GARAGE DOOR, HOUSE LIGHTS, ETC. IN WHICH TOYOTA SAY IS A \"HOME CENTER CONTROL\" - I HAVE NOT PUT ANYTHING ON THE VISOR TO MAKE IT ANY HEAVIER THAN HOW THE FACTORY PRODUCED IT. THE VISOR IS TOO HEAVY AND IT CAN NOT BE SUPPORTED BY THE METAL PART THAT CONNECTS IT TO THE ROOF OF THE CAR. THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP GAVE NO SOLUTION OTHER THAN TO REPLACE THE VISOR AT MY COST BUT I HAVE READ OTHER PEOPLES POSTS SAYING THAT THE ISSUE WILL ONLY HAPPEN AGAIN.  THEY INFORMED ME THE PART ALONE IS $800 WITHOUT INSTALLATION.  I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE VELCRO WOULD WORK SO I TRIED TO VELCRO THE VISOR TO THE ROOF OF MY CAR BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE VELCOR IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD THE VISOR TO THE ROOF AND DURING THE SUMMER THE GLUE MELTS AND DOESN'T ALLOW THE VELCRO TO STICK TO THE ROOF THUS I CAN NOT KEEP THE VISOR UP.  THIS ISSUE STARTED ABOUT 2007 AND PROGRESSIVELY GOT WORSE AND NOW THE VISOR WILL NOT STAY UP MORE THAN A COUPLE OF MINUTES - ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER.  FIRSTLY THE VISOR ITSELF IS DISTRACTION, SECONDLY ONCE IT'S DOWN IT BLOCKS A PORTION OF THE DRIVER'S VIEW, AND THIRDLY IT'S A DISTRACTION TO HAVE TO USE ONE HAND TO PUT THE VISOR BACK UP.  YOU CAN NOT EVEN TRY TO MOVE IT TO THE SIDE AS IT'S STILL TOO LOW TO SEE OUT THE DRIVER SIDE WINDOW AND ALSO THER ARE NO ACCESSIBLE SCREWS TO REMOVE THE VISOR MYSELF.

THEY TOLD HER THE ENGINE HAD A BLOWN HEAD GASKET. WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS BECAUSE THE CYLINDER HEAD BOLTS ARE STRIPPED ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE ENGINE. THIS IS WHAT CAUSED THE COOLANT LEAK IN THE FIRST PLACE. SERVCO TOLD US THAT THE SURE REPAIR (A WHOLE NEW ENGINE) WOULD EXCEED $20,000, AND THE LESS SURE REPAIR (TRYING TO FIX THE OLD ENGINE) WOULD COST $13,000. WE PICKED UP THE CAR THE NEXT DAY AND TOOK IT TO PRIAM'S AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE & REPAIR AT 2002 PAUOA ROAD. THEY DID A QUICK TEST AND SAID THAT THE HEAD GASKET WAS INDEED BLOWN, AND REFERRED US TO ROD'S AUTO SERVICE AT 972 KAWAIAHAO STREET BECAUSE PRIAM'S WAS NOT EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THAT MAGNITUDE OF REPAIR. ROD'S HAS ADVISED US THAT THE BEST SOLUTION IS REPLACING THE ENTIRE ENGINE WITH A REBUILT ENGINE FOR $5,000, BUT THIS HAS BECOME A COMMON PROBLEM WITH TOYOTA HIGHLANDERS AND LOCATING A REBUILT ENGINE ON THE MAINLAND WILL TAKE TIME. IN DOING SOME INTERNET RESEARCH, I'VE LEARNED THAT CAMRYS OF THE SAME VINTAGE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED SIMILAR PROBLEMS, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE TOYOTA IS REFUSING TO RECALL THE VEHICLES AND FIX THE DESIGN FLAW.
