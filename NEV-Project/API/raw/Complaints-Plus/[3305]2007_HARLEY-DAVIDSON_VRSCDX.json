THE VEHICLE IS LIQUID COOLED WITH A RADIATOR.  ON TWO OCCASIONS, THE BOLTS THAT SUPPORT THE RADIATOR HAVE FALLEN OUT, WHICH COULD BE POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS AND CAUSE THE ENGINE TO FAIL.  ALL OF THE FAILURES OCCURRED WITHIN ONE MONTH OF PURCHASING THE BRAND NEW VEHICLE.  THE DEALER COULD NOT FIND ANY FAILURE WITH THE FUEL GAUGE AND THE SPEEDOMETER.  AFTER NUMEROUS VISITS, THE DEALER WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE THE FAILURE WITH THE ENGINE AND THEY DECIDED TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE FUEL GAUGE.  THE VIN WAS UNKNOWN.
