THEY SET UP AN APPOINTMENT AND I ASSUMED FIXED THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THIS SPECIFIC LIGHT NEVER WENT ON AGAIN.  WE DID NOTICE AND REPORTED THAT AT TIMES THE BEEPING AND LIGHTING UP OF THE COLLISION WARNING SAFETY FEATURE DID NOT WORK PROPERLY.  THIS ACTUALLY RESULTING IN A SMALL SCRAP DIRECTLY BELOW THE SENSOR WHILE PARKING.  WE MADE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT BUT THEY COULD NOT FIND THE CAUSE.  I ASKED OUR SALESPERSON, CHRIS FAUST, IF THIS WOULD RESULT IN A CHARGE ON OUR LEASED VEHICLE AND HE SAID NO IT WAS AN EASY FIX.  WE WERE LEAVING FOR OUR ANNUAL SNOWBIRD TRIP TO FLORIDA IN A FEW DAYS AND THE LEASE WAS OVER SHORTLY AFTER WE RETURNED HOME SO I SAID IT WASN'T THAT NOTICEABLE.  WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE IT IN FOR REPAIR.  CHRIS SAID THAT IT WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM UPON INSPECTION AND IF QUESTIONED THEY WOULD REPAIR IT BEFORE.  I SAID FINE.  WHILE IN FLORIDA, CLOSE TO THE TIME FOR OUR TRIP HOME WE WERE ALMOST IN AN ACCIDENT WHEN A VEHICLE SUDDENLY STOPPED IN FRONT OF US WHILE PULLING OUT OF A SHOPPING CENTER UNTO A BUSY STREET.  NONE OF THE WARNING SYSTEMS OR AUTO BRAKING SYSTEMS WORKED AND THE RESULT WAS MISSING THE VEHICLE BY INCHES ALONG WITH SEVERELY JOLTING MY WIFE AND I.  IT DID RESULT IN A NECK INJURY TO ME WHICH I THOUGHT WAS MUSCULAR AND WOULD GO AWAY BUT IT DID NOT.  THE INJURY WAS TREATED AND IS STILL BEING TREATED. AFTER READING SOME OF THE SAFETY ISSUES WITH THE HYUNDAI GENESIS WE DECIDED NOT TO PURCHASE THE VEHICLE.

WE WERE UNABLE TO ADD THE REMOTE  PACKAGE DUE TO AN INTERNET SERVER PROBLEM. WE WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ENROLL IN THE REMOTE STARTING SERVICE UNTIL DEC 21.  ON THE MORNING OF 12/23 I LOGGED ON TO THE SMARTPHONE APP AND  PROCEEDED TO REMOTE START MY CAR FOR 2 MINUTES. MY CAR WAS PARKED  3 CAR DETACHED GARAGE WITH DOUBLE DOOR GARAGE DOOR OPENED. I STOOD AT BACKDOOR TO WATCH THE CAR START SUCCESSFULLY. I WALKED AWAY AND 5 MINUTES LATER I WHEN TO SEE THAT MY CAR WAS NO LONGER RUNNING. IT WAS NOT. I LEFT MY GARAGE DOOR OPENED.  I WAS IN MY OFFICE AND AT 1:10 PM MY NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR WHO CAN ALSO SEE MY GARAGE FROM BACK OF HER HOUSE TO TELL ME THE LIGHTS ON MY CAR HAVE BEEN ON FOR LONG TIME. SHE KNEW I BOUGHT A NEW CAR AND THOUGHT IT WAS STRANGE THAT MY LIGHTS WERE STILL ON. I INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM. I FOUND MY CAR WITH THE LIGHTS ON WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING.THE DASHBOARD DISPLAY SHOWED THAT I WAS LOW ON FUEL.   I  TURNED OFF CAR AND IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED HYUNDIA CUSTOMER CARE AND SPOKE TO A REPRESENTATIVE TO REPORT MY EXTREME CONCERN. BEFORE I PURCHASED I CALLED HYUNDIA TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS CAR HAD AN AUTOMATIC SHUT OFF PROGRAM SYSTEM. I SAW A 60 MIN REPORT ON PEOPLE WHO DIED AFTER FORGETTING TO TURN OFF CAR WITH KEY LESS STARTERS AND THEIR CARS DID NOT HAVE AN AUTOMATIC SHUT OFF PROGRAM.    THE HYINDIA CUSTOMER REP TOOK MY REPORT TOLD ME TO HAVE DEALER SERVICE CHECK SYSTEM AND ALSO TURNED ME OVER TO A BLINK REP WHO I REPORTED THE INCIDENCE TO WITH ALL THE DETAILS WHO GAVE ME THE CASE NUMBER OF BL000293583.
