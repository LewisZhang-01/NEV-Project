AT THAT POINT I SHOULD HAVE THE TRANSMISSION REPLACED.   AFTER EXTENSIVE RESEARCH I LOCATED TSBS FOR THIS VEHICLE AND FOUND ONE THAT ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE (TSB ATRATB351 DATED JAN 96).  THIS MONTH 1/2003 I RETURNED TO TOYOTA WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT AND THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY $150.00 TO PERFORM THIS TSB.  I TOLD THEM IF THEY HAD PERFORMED IT THE PREVIOUS YEAR WHEN I HAD THE HEAD GASKETS REPLACED IT WOULD NOT HAVE COST ME ANYTHING SINCE THE ENGINE WAS ALREADY APART FOR OTHER WORK.  THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID HE COULD NOT ADDRESS THE RECOMMENDATION AND FINDINGS OF THEIR WORK FROM A YEAR AGO.  I CALLED ANOTHER DEALER AND THEY SAID IT WOULD COST $71.00 FOR THE WORK TO BE PERFORMED.  AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED SINCE A TSB HAS BEEN ISSUED IT IS BASICALLY ADMITTING THAT THE VEHICLE HAS A PROBLEM AND PROVIDES THE DEALER/SERVICE DEPARTMENTS WITH THE FIX, SO WHY ARE THE SERVICE MANAGERS RELUCTANT TO PERFORM THE CORRECTION, BUT INSTEAD RECOMMEND AN TRANSMISSION CHANGE?",
