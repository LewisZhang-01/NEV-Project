        "summary": "At under 3000 miles car started sputtering sporadically  and stopped driving while in motion.  We were able to get the car home.  Tried to start the car back up and it violently surged.  Car had no idea what gear it was in.  Transmission service now light came on and car sent me an email stating to take it to the dealership.  Had car towed to dealer and used tow company they requested me to use..  Dealer says valve body flooded and replaced it.   Still not working correctly and dealer says transmission is being flooded.  Gm engineers not sure why.  Car has been at dealer over a month and have no clue when it can be fixed.  When you shifted from park to reverse car would lunge violently like you threw the transmission into park while the car was moving down the street.   Car is not safe to drive as it just started to have issues during regular use. Dealer has confirmed and recreated the problem.  I was told if valve body didn\u2019t fix it that gm would overnight a new transmission.  Now I\u2019m being told they want to continue to debug the issue and they have no clue on what the issue is or when it can be fixed.  I\u2019m out a vehicle I count on and am still paying for a car that I can\u2019t have use of.  Dealer is dodging my calls now.  Here is my open case with Chevrolet asking about lemon law protections since it may be another month before I get my car back.

Soon after that the car would lurch, buck on acceleration, and would only drive in even numbered gears.  I felt the car was extremely dangerous and unpredictable to drive in this state since the car was unpredictably bucking and lurching forward and not shifting smoothly as usual.  The dealer ran an OBDII poll and found five codes relating to transmission issues.  GM has admitted to me that my vehicle is one of several that have \"Assembly Debris\" in the TREMEC supplied DCT.  This \"Assembly Debris\" made the transmission filter completely black in appearance at 750 miles in addition to triggering the check engine light and dangerous driving behavior.",
