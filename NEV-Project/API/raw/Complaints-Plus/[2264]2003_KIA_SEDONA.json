ANYWHERE FROM HAVING TO REPLACE THE ALTERNATOR, WHICH I WILL SAY WAS A PAIN IN THE BUTT...TO MAJOR ISSUES WITH THE BRAKES.  FROM READING MANY DIFFERENT SITES THIS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON ISSUE!!!!!!!!!!!!  IT IS JUST SO FRUSTRATING THAT YOU PURCHASE A VAN BECAUSE THEY SAY IT IS GREAT THEN YOU GET THIS PIECE OF JUNK.  THE SAD THING IS MOST PEOPLE WHO OWN THESE ARE YOUNG COUPLES WITH CHILDREN AND CAN NOT AFFORD THE REPAIRS BUT HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM AND WE ARE STUCK WITH THESES TRASH BOXES BECAUSE WE HAVE CHILDREN AND CAN NOT AFFORD TO GO OUT AND TRADE IT IN, LOSE OUR BUTTS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT WORTH THE MONEY WE OWE ON THEM.  I CAN NOT AFFORD TO KEEP FIXING THIS HEAP OF JUNK BUT I AM STUCK WITH IT.  I HOPE THAT SOMETHING GETS DONE WITH THESE...THEY ARE WORTHLESS AND MY CHILDREN ARE PAYING FOR IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I HAVE NOT HAD A VEHICLE SO BAD IN MY LIFE...I AM TIRED OF REPLACING THE BRAKES, ROUTERS, AND NOW THE CALIPERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!*TR",
