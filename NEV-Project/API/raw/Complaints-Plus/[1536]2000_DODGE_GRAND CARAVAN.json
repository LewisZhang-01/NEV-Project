FOR THE WARRANTY TO COVER IT, IT WILL NEED TO FAIL WITHIN 5 YEARS OR 100,000 MILES. WELL WE ARE PAST THAT NOW AND IT HAS FAILED. WHAT TO DO? THE DEALER CAN FIX IT BUT IT COSTS ME $1200 TO $1400. FOR AN ONGOING PROBLEM THIS IS NOT FAIR AND REASONABLE. NOT TO MENTION, MORE THAN HALF OF THE COMPLAINTS ON THIS SITE ARE OF THIS EXACT ISSUE. AND IT RUNS THROUGH MANY YEARS. DO WE NEED TO WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE IS INJURED BEFORE THIS IS CORRECTED. DODGE IS AWARE THEY HAVE EVEN MADE UP A KIT TO ASSIST WITH THIS ISSUE. IS THERE A CLASS ACTION? THIS VAN WAS $33,000. NEW IN 2000 WHEN WE PURCHASED IT. THIS IS NOT FAIR OR REASONABLE. WHO NEEDS TO BE TALKED TO  GET THIS FIXED? IS THE SCOPE SO LARGE THAT THEY CAN NOT ALL BE FIXED?  DO I NEED TO JUNK THE VAN BECAUSE THE REPAIR IS MORE THAN IT'S STREET VALUE? *TR",

I HAD TO HAVE MY VEHICLE TOWED AND IT IS GOING TO COST APPROX. 500.00 TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE FOR THE 7TH TIME.   I HAVE FOUND THE ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM THAT 30+ FOLKS ON THIS SITE ALONE ARE HAVING.  #1 THE BELT IS SMOOTH ON ONE SIDE AND GROOVED ON THE OTHER SIDE SO WHEN OIL, RAIN ETC. TOUCHES THE BELT, IT SLIPS OFF.  WHAT I FOUND IT THAT THERE IS A DRAIN HOSE THAT SITS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BELT WHEN THE WATER FROM RAIN COMES THROUGH THE DRAIN FROM THE WINDSHIELD INTO THIS HOSE, AND DRIPS RIGHT ON TOP OF THE BELT CAUSING IT TO BE FAULTY.  THE HOSE HAS TO BE DIRECTED INTO A DIFFERENT PLACE .   I ALSO FOUND THAT G. AUTO MAKES A KIT THAT COMES WITH THE BELT, TENSIONER AND ALL ACCESSORIES TO FIX THE PROBLEM PERMANANTLY.  THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE HOSE AND THE TENSIONER IS GROOVED TO PROVIDE NO SLIPPAGE.  I HAVE SPOKEN TO 2 AUTO DEALERS THAT HAVE ADVISED ME THAT THEY HAVE HAD NUMEROUS PROBLEMS WITH THIS ISSUE INCLUDING A SHOP IN TENNESSEE THAT SAID THAT THEY HAVE WORKED ON 15 2000 DODGE GRAND CARAVANS IN THE LAST 2 MONTHS WITH AN AVERAGE OF 4-8 BELTS BEING LOST AND HAVING TO BE REPLACED FOR EACH VAN FROM 2000.  THERE IS NOWHERE TO COMPLAIN, SO YOU WOULD NOT BE AWARE OF THE SEVERITY OF THIS ISSUE WITH OUT CHECKING INVENTORIES.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY DODGE DEALERS THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT THE KITS AND THE PROBLEM AND I HAVE CONTACTED DODGE CORPORATION BUT AS YOU AND I KNOW, A RECALL WILL COST THEM MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  WHAT ABOUT THE LIVES THAT MAY HAVE OR MIGHT BE LOST WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING AND THE STEERING GOES OUT.  THIS SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.  THE ISSUE IS THAT FOLKS BOUGHT THESE CARS IN GOOD FAITH AND THEY HAVE PAID HUNDREDS AND MAYBE THOUSAND OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKETS THAT THEY SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAD TO IF THIS PROBLEM WAS TAKEN CARE OF IN THE BEGINNING.

HAD IT TOWED TO A REPAIR SHOP WHO REPLACED THE BELT TENSIONER AND BELT.  SECOND TIME, ABOUT A YEAR LATER, MY WIFE HIT WATER WHICH ALSO KNOCKED THE BELT OFF AND STRANDED HER AND MY 3 CHILDREN 15 MILES FROM HOME.  BROTHER IN LAW WAS ABLE TO COME AND SPENT AN HOUR OF GUT WRENCHING LABOR TO PUT THE BELT BACK ON.  THIRD TIME, A MONTH LATER IT CAME OFF AGAIN SHREDDING THE BELT AND LEAVING MY WIFE STRANDED BY HERSELF AFTER DROPPING MY KIDS OFF FOR SCHOOL. I HAD IT TOWED TO A REPUTABLE REPAIR SHOP WHO SAID IT NEEDED ANOTHER BELT TENSIONER AND ASSURED ME THE NAPA PRODUCT WOULD PERFORM BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE.  HE TRIED TO SEE IF A KIT WAS AVAILABLE FOR OUR LARGE 6 CYLINDER ENGINE BUT COULD NOT FIND ONE.  FOURTH TIME, ONE MONTH LATER AS MY WIFE WAS DRIVING 2 OF MY CHILDREN TO SCHOOL IN THE RAIN, THE BELT CAME OFF AGAIN BUT THIS TIME SHE DIDN'T HIT ANY WATER.  HAD IT TOWED BACK TO THE REPAIR SHOP.  THEY CHECKED ALL COMPONETS CONNECTED TO THE SERPENTINE BELT AND TRIED FOR 30 MINUTES TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM BY POURING WATER OVER THE BELT, ETC. WITH NO SUCCESS.  OWNER SAYS HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM EVEN THOUGH HE IS AWARE THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR DODGE VANS.  QUESTION:  IF THIS IS SUCH A WIDE SPREAD PROBLEM AS SHOWN BY ALL THE COMPLAINTS FOR THE SAME PROBLEM ON THIS WEBSITE WHY HAS THERE NOT BEEN A RECALL TO CORRECT WHATEVER IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM?    ANSWER:  BECAUSE IT WILL COST DODGE/ CHRYSLER TOO MUCH MONEY.  SOLUTION:  UNLESS YOU CAN ONLY DRIVE A DODGE VAN ON WARM SUNNY DAYS DON'T BOTHER BUYING A DODGE VAN.

I TOLD HIM, BY PHONE, TO ADD SOME COOLANT TO THE RADIATOR.  HE PURCHASED A CONTAINER BUT THE RADIATOR ONLY TOOK 1/2 OF THE CONTAINER.    AFTER A WHILE, THE RED LIGHT AND CRUISE LIGHT WENT OFF SO HE STARTED THE CAR TO DRIVE HOME WHICH WAS ABOUT 2 MILES AWAY.  AS HE ASCENDED A SLIGHT INCLINE, HE SAW SMOKE COMING OUT OF BOTH SIDES OF THE HOOD, MORE FROM THE DRIVER'S SIDE. HE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED THE CAR, TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND STEPPED OUT TO THE FRONT OF THE CAR.  HE OPENED THE HOOD AND SOMETHING IMMEDIATELY BURST INTO FLAME.  THE FLAME WAS ABOUT 5-10 FT HIGH.  HERMAN SAID IT LOOKED LIKE A HOUSE ON FIRE.  HE STEPPED BACK WHEN ANOTHER EXPLOSION ERUPTED.  POLICE AND FIREMEN CONVERGED ON T HE SCENE AND AFTER THINGS COOLED DOWN, AN INSPECTION WAS MADE.

CHRYSLER DOES NOT OFFER TO REPAIR IT FOR FREE.    I AM CURRENTLY OUT OF MY PRINTING CAREER AND AM HAVING DIFFICULTY FINDING WORK AGAIN, SO THE $250 PLUS TO HAVE THIS REPAIRED IS A HEAVY LOAD AT THIS TIME.

I KNOW THE NHTSA IS INVESTIGATING THIS, BUT WITH HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINS ALREADY FILED, HOW MUCH MORE INFORMATION DOES IT NEED TO ACT? I DONT KNOW THE PROCESS, BUT WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW? THIS IS A SAFTEY ISSUE, AND THIS IS OUR FAMILIY VEHICLE. PLUS, THE ANNUAL INSPECTION IS COMING UP IN LESS THAN 4 MONTHS, AND IT WILL NOT PASS WITHOUT THE HORN AND CRUISE AND AIRBAG BROKEN.

I HAVE BEEN WITH  OUT MY VAN ON A REGULAR BASIS, WITH OUT RESOLUTION. THE OWNER OF THE DEALERSHIP, [XXX], WAS IN THE VAN - IN HIS SHOP AND THE VAN DROPPED INTO NEUTRAL WHEN HE PUT IT INTO DRIVE. (NOT MOVING).  AFTER MANY VISITS OF WE CANNOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM, THE CHRYSLER CORP WAS CONTACTED BY DODGE.  A RETURN FAX TO THE PRIOR SERVICE MANAGER [XXX]  , TOLD THEM NOT TO DO ANYTHING UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS  DUPLICATED.  I HAVE TALKED TO [XXX] ASKING HIM TO REPLACE THIS VAN, OF COURSE HE CANNOT DO THAT. I HAVE EMAILED DODGE CORP ASKING THEM TO FIX OR REPLACE AS THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THEY REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION, WITHIN 2 WEEKS THE VAN WAS DOING THIS AGAIN. I CALLED AND WAS TOLD THEY WOULD GET BACK WITH ME. I HAD TO CALL THEM BACK. THE RESOLUTION THIS TIME WAS BRING IT IN WILL TAKE IT FOR A DRIVE.

I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP FIRST THING TUESDAY MORNING AND TOOK IT THE SHOP ON THURSDAY.  THEY REPAIRED A LEAK IN THE TRANSMISSION (WHICH WE HAD HAD REPAIRED PREVIOUSLY) AND REPLACED THE WATER PUMP.  TWO DAYS LATER WHILE OUT RUNNING ERRANDS THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN.  I HAD TO EXIT THE FREEWAY BECAUSE THE ENGINE WOULD NOT SHIFT GEARS AGAIN AND AT 50 MPH (IN A 60 MPH ZONE) THE ENGINE WAS AT 4 RPMS.  BEFORE I COULD GET HOME THE ENGINE QUIT IN THE MIDDLE OF A HIGHWAY INTERSECTION WITH TRAFFIC COMING AT ME FROM BEHIND AT 55 MPH.  I WAS ABLE TO GET IT STARTED  BUT IT LURCHED FOR ABOUT A QUARTER MILE OR SO AND I JUST DROVE NO MORE THAN 30 MPH FOR THE NEXT 5 MILES TO MY HOME.

MY HUSBAND TAKES CARE OF THE MAINTENANCE ON THIS VEHICLE AND FOLLOWED THE MANUFACTURER'S INSTRUCTIONS.  THERE WAS NEVER ANY INDICATION THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION PRIOR TO IT'S FAILURE.  THE TRANSMISSION SHOP HAS STATED THAT THE COOLER ON THE TRANSMISSION CAUSES A BACKFLOW OF FLIUD IN THE LINES FORCING THE TORQUE CONVERTER TO DROP METAL SHREDS INTO THE TRANSMISSION.  THEIR OPINION IS THAT THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY A CHRYSLER DESIGN FLAW.

I HAVE HAD SEVERAL PROBLEMS WITH THIS MINIVAN, INCLUDING A DASHBOARD MELTING OVER THE AIRBAG AND A BELT NEEDING TO BE REPLACED 2X ALREADY AND QUITE POSSIBLY A THIRD NOW.  CHRYSLER REFUSES TO STANS BEHIND THESE VANS BECAUSE THEY ARE OUT OF THE MILEAGE WARRANTY AND IT'S NOT RIGHT.

I BROUGHT THE TIRE TO NATIONAL TIRE AND BATTERY AND THE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THAT THE RIM WAS SLIGHTLY BENT AND THAT THIS CAUSED THE BLOW OUT. I AM EXPECTING TO PAY ABOUT $135 FOR THE REPAIR, BUT I HAVE TALKED WITH SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO KNOW TIRES FAIRLY WELL AND THEY SAID A SLIGHTLY BENT RIM SHOULD NOT HAVE CAUSED THIS PROBLEM. I AM MORE CONCERNED THAT THE OTHER 3 TIRES MAY BLOW AT ANY TIME AND THAT MY FAMILY COULD BE AT RISK.  I AM ASKING THE TECHNICIAN TO CHECK ALL THE TIRES FOR ANY DEFECTS AFTER EXPERIENCING THIS, HOPEFULLY IF THERE IS AN ISSUE THEY WILL NOT HIDE IT FROM ME SO THEY CAN MAKE A PROFIT.
