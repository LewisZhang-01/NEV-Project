WE COULD BARELY MAINTAIN SPEED ON INCLINES AND HAD TO STOP FOR LOW OIL PRESSURE MULTIPLE TIMES. WE COULD HAVE BEEN STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE WITH NO CELL RECEPTION. A PROBLEM I ANTICIPATED AND EXPRESSED TO FORD WHEN I RETURNED THE VEHICLE FOR THE SIXTH ATTEMPT. I WANT THE VEHICLE REPLACED WITH THE SAME VEHICLE THAT IS NOT DEFECTIVE.  THAT IS ALL. WHY IS THIS SUCH A CHALLENGE FOR FORD TO SOLVE? I HAVE LITERALLY INVESTED HUNDREDS OF HOURS ATTEMPTING TO NAVIGATE THIS NIGHTMARE. ATTACHED IS THE LETTER I SENT FORD IN SEP 2020.

THERE ARE 7 (NOW 8) COMPLAINTS ABOUT STRUTS/SUSPENSION FOR THE 2018 FORD EXPEDITION.  MORE DETAIL IS BELOW.     THE DEALER CALLED ME TODAY (SIX DAYS AFTER DROPPING IT OFF) AND SAYS ALL FOUR OF THE STRUT ASSEMBLIES NEED TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE THEY ARE LEAKING AND IT WILL COST ~$1700 PLUS TAX.  I SAID STRUTS ARE COVERED UNDER MY PREMIUM CARE EXTENDED WARRANTY (NOT TO MENTION I AM JUST PAST 36K MILES FOR NORMAL WARRANTY - SO IT COULD BE AN AFTER WARRANTY ITEM TOO AS I'VE NEVER REPLACED STRUTS ON ANY CAR). WHEN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WENT TO ENTER THE STRUT CODE INTO THE EXTENDED WARRANTY SYSTEM, STRUTS AREN'T AN OPTION CODE, BUT SHOCKS ARE.      THE PROBLEM IS SHOCKS AREN'T COVERED AND THEY CAN'T FIND A CODE TO GET THE STRUT ASSEMBLY COVERED. THE ONLY PARTS THAT FORD SELLS FOR THE SUSPENSION ARE LABELED SHOCK ABSORBERS, AND STRUTS ARE NOT A SOLD OPTION.  THE DEALER THINKS FORD SHOULD COVER AS THEY BELIEVE IT FALLS UNDER THE WARRANTY  .MY PREMIER CARE CONTRACT AND THE PREMIER CARE BROCHURE SAYS STRUTS ARE COVERED, AS WELL.  IT APPEARS FORD IS TRYING TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITY.      SO I HAVE AUTHORIZED THE REPAIR SO THE CAR IS DRIVEABLE (I AM GETTING BRAKES AND NORMAL MAINTENANCE DONE TOO).
