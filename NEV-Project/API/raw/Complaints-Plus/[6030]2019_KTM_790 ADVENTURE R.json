        "summary": "Hello,   I purchased this motorcycle new in July 2019.    It currently has 9,100 miles.    Since new it takes a minimum of 3-4 times to start and stay running at first start of the day.   After that it starts easy and on the first try.     Temperature at first start has been anywhere from upper 30's\u00b0 to upper 70's\u00b0.    Altitude from 500' - 4,500', basically starts the same in all instances.    It seems as if it's only running on one cylinder and then \"chuffs\" and dies. Repeat, repeat, repeat.   When it finally \"catches\" R.P.M. will rise up around 1,500ish R.P.M. and run smoothly.   On its first few attempts the engine will barely make it to 900-1,000 R.P.M. before dying.        Thank you for your assistance with this issue.",

ROTOR THICKNESS IS WEAR BUT WARPING IS NOT WEAR, ESPECIALLY ON A NEW BIKE. HAVING DONE MORE  RESEARCH ONLINE SINCE MY FIRST ATTEMPT TO GET ROTORS REPLACED LAST YEAR, I SEE IT HAS AFFECTED NUMEROUS OTHER OWNERS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE SUCCESSFULLY HAD ROTORS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY OTHERS NOT. I BROUGHT INTO DEALER AGAIN LAST MONTH TO SEE IF THEY WOULD REPLACE BUT AGAIN WAS REFUSED. NOT SURE WHY SOME DEALERS / OWNERS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL GETTING WARRANTY DONE BUT SEEM LIKE A KNOWN ISSUE TO KTM AND SHOULD BE RECALL. THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THE MATTER",
