WE HAVE HAD ALL REGULAR SERVICE AND REPAIRS DONE AT AN AUDI AUTHORIZED DEALER IN NORTH SCOTTSDALE, AZ AND BETWEEN 2005-2009, WHILE LIVING/WORKING FOR A SHORT-TERM IN SAN JOSE, CA.  WE PUT MINIMAL MILES ON THIS VEHICLE AS A SECOND AUTOMOBILE.  OUR CURRENT MILEAGE IS 82,000 MILES.    IN 2005, AT 53,813 MILES, WE HAD REGULAR SERVICE PERFORMED AT STEVENS CREEK AUDI, IN SAN JOSE, CA.  DURING THAT VISIT, WE STATED CONCERN OVER THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER PANEL'S WARNING OF A PROBLEM WITH OUR HEADLIGHTS, LOW BEAMS OR PARKING LIGHTS.  THE TECHNICIAN REPLACED THE RUNNING LIGHT BULBS BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER PANEL CONTINUED AND HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY WORSE WITH MORE FAILURES TO THIS DATE, SUCH AS THE GAS GAUGE DOES NOT OPERATE, THE DIGITAL READOUT IS DIFFICULT TO READ, ETC.    WHEN WE INVESTIGATED THE INSTRUMENT PANEL CONCERN WITH OUR TECHNICIAN RECENTLY IN SCOTTSDALE, WE LEARNED, BY LOOKING ONLINE, OF THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AND AUDI'S FREE REPAIR OFFER (SEE INFORMATION BELOW).  WE HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THIS IN 2008 ' OTHERWISE, WE WOULD HAVE HAD THE REPAIR DONE IN THE TIMEFRAME GIVEN.

THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE SUGGESTED THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS AN EXAMPLE OF ERRATIC ACTIVITY EXPECTED FROM A SHORT IN THE A/C CONTROL HEAD AND SAID I WOULD HAVE TO BEAR THE COST OF ANOTHER SERVICE CALL: $106.00 TO SHUT OFF THE HEAT OR SHUT DOWN THE ENTIRE CLIMATE CONTROL SYSTEM (AS I REQUESTED). I ARRANGED TO MEET WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER AND SERVICE FOREMAN THE FOLLOWING DAY.  CLIMATE CONTROL WAS CHECKED VIA THE SCAN TOOL AND HAD MULTIPLE FAULTS RECORDED FOR FLAP MOTORS. ATTEMPT TO SET BASIC SETTINGS OF MOTORS WAS UNSUCCESSFUL; ALL MOTORS RECORDED FAULTS. SERVICE FOREMAN CONCLUDED THAT THE CLIMATE CONTROL HEAD WAS FAULTY.  I CONSULTED WITH THE FOREMAN ON OPTIONS TO SHUT OFF HEAT TO THE CABIN AND AGREED TO HIS SUGGESTION TO REMOVE THE TEMP FLAP CONTROL MOTOR AND SET FLAP IN COOL POSITION. MOTOR AND ATTACHED PARTS HAVE BEEN STOWED BY OWNER FOR POSSIBLE REINSTALLATION AT A LATER DATE.  SERVICE MANAGER AND I MADE A GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT TO SPLIT THE COST OF THE ADDITIONAL REPAIR.
