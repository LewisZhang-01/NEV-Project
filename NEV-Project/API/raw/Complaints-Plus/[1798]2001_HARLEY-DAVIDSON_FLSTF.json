I FIRST NOTICED THE VIBRATION LAST YEAR. AFTER INSPECTING THE CAM SIDE / OIL PUMP ASSEMBLY, IT WAS OBVIOUS THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CRANKSHAFT WAS WAY OUT OF TOLERANCE. THE OIL PUMP WAS CHEWING THE FRONT HALF OF THE CAM PLATE. I REALIZE MY BIKE IS OLDER, BUT THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH TWIN CAM MOTORS.  I HAVE SPENT OVER $2,000.00 REBUILDING MY MOTOR. HARLEY DAVIDSON HAS REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT MY COST IN PARTS, I AM DOING THE WORK MYSELF. I STILL HAVE THE ORIGINAL CAM PLATE / OIL PUMP AND THE BAD CRANKSHAFT WHICH IS CERTAINLY AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION. BY THE WAY, I DO NOT RACE OR ABUSE MY MOTORCYCLE. *TR",
