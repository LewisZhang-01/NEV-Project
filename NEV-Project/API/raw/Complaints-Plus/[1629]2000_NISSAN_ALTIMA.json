I TOOK MY CAR TO MONRO MUFFLER WHERE THE VEHICLE WAS PLACED ON A LIFT AND THE UNDERSIDE INSPECTED.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SUBFRAME WAS SO BADLY CORRODED BY RUST THAT THE FRAME HAD PERFORATED AND BROKEN AWAY FROM THE SUSPENSION.  THERE ARE HOLES THROUGHOUT AS WELL AS BREAKAGE AND WEAKENING.  MONRO MUFFLER RECOMMENDED I CONTACT NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS WHICH I DID.  I EXPLAINED THE SITUATION TO NISSAN STATING THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE.  I WAS DIRECTED BY NISSAN TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO A NISSAN DEALER FOR A DIAGNOSIS WHICH I DID.   NISSAN OF DARTMOUTH, MA CONFIRMED MONRO MUFFLER'S DIAGNOSIS AND QUOTED A MINIMUM $2,300 TO REPAIR BOTH THE FRONT AND REAR SUBFRAMES.  BEVERLY BANSEK OF NISSAN CALLED ME BACK TO INFORM ME THAT NISSAN WOULD DO NOTHING FOR THE REPAIR.  I ASKED FOR A SUPERVISOR AND I WAS THEN CONTACTED BY THE REGIONAL SUPERVISOR OF NISSAN, VAUGHN FRANCIS WHO, AFTER REVIEWING MY CLAIM AGAIN, STATED THAT NISSAN WOULD DO NOTHING FOR ME AND THAT THE DISINTEGRATION OF THE SUBFRAMES WAS DUE TO A LACK OF OWNER MAINTENANCE RATHER THAN A DEFECT IN WORKMANSHIP.  VAUGHN FRANCIS THEN STATED THAT THERE WAS NO NEED FOR ME TO CALL NISSAN AGAIN AS I WOULD ONLY GET HIM AND THE ANSWER WOULD BE THE SAME AND THAT MY ONLY OPTION WAS TO CONTACT THE BBB AUTOLINE DISPUTE RESOLUTION DIVISION AT 1-800-955-5100 WHICH I HAVE DONE.  TWO NISSAN DEALERSHIPS STATE THERE IS NO OWNER MAINTENANCE RECOMMENDED ON THE SUBFRAMES OF NISSAN'S VEHICLES.  IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THE FAILURE OF THE SUBFRAMES IS DUE TO EXCESSIVE CORROSION OF THE SUBFRAME WHICH HAS LEAD TO PERFORATION POSSIBLY FROM THE INSIDE OUT AND BECAUSE THIS IS AN ISSUE OF WORKMANSHIP, NISSAN SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED FOR A POSSIBLE SAFETY RELATED DEFECT RESULTING FROM INADEQUATE MANUFACTURER'S CORROSIVE RESISTANT PROTECTION AND/OR SUBFRAME DESIGN.",

AROUND 89,000 MILES IT BEGAN TO SHAKE WHEN IDLING AND THE NOISE WAS WORSE. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WOULD COME ON INTERMITTENTLY. MY HUSBAND FOUND THE INFO ON THIS SITE, I PRINTED IT OUT AND TOOK IT TO CARMAX AND TOLD THEM TO FIX MY MANIFOLD INTAKE GASKET! THEY WOULDN'T REFUND MY $80 FROM THE FIRST VISIT, NOR WOULD THE PAY ME $80 FOR DIAGNOSING IT MYSELF. HA. OH WELL. THEY DID $600 WORTH OF REPAIRS, WHICH WAS MOSTLY COVERED BY MY EXTENDED WARRANTY (WHICH EXPIRES AT 92,500 MILES). THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE PROBLEM HAD ALSO CAUSED PREMATURE WEAR OF MY SPARK PLUGS, HOWEVER, AND THE WARRANTY WOULD NOT COVER THAT.   BASED ON MY ONLINE RESEARCH, IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS DUE TO HEAT AROUND THE CYLINDER 4 AREA FROM THE EGR PIPE WHICH BAKES THE GASKET INTO LEAKING AND THAT EVEN THOUGH I GOT IT FIXED THIS TIME, IT WILL LIKELY HAVE TO BE REPLACED AGAIN IN THE FUTURE.

NISSAN SHOULD FIX THIS UNDER AN EXTENDED WARRANTY BUT THEY REFUSED.  HERE ARE DETAILS OF THE ISSUE:  THERE IS AN ENGINEERING OR MATERIAL DEFECT ON THE KA24DE ENGINE IN REGARDS TO THE INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET. FROM READING THE POSTS OF DOZENS OF OWNERS IT APPEARS IT IS HAPPENING TO ENGINES MADE IN THE 00-01 TIME FRAME. IF THIS WERE JUST SOME RANDOM PROBLEM THEN YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE ABOUT THE SAME NUMBER OF POSTS ON P0304 AND GASKET LEAKS FOR ANY YEAR CAR. JUST ABOUT ALL THE POSTS CONCERN SPECIFICALLY 00-01. THE FIRST HAND EVIDENCE I HAD IS WHEN I TOOK OFF MY INTAKE MANIFOLD AND CHECKED THE CONDITION OF THE GASKET. THE SIDE WITH THE LEAK WAS AT CYLINDER 4. WHEN I TOOK OFF THE GASKET, THE MATERIAL AT THE CYLINDER 4 SIDE WAS WHAT I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE AS \"BAKED\". IT WAS HARD AND BRITTLE AND WOULD JUST CRACK OR SNAP VERY EASILY. THE CLOSER THE GASKET WAS TO THE NUMBER 1 CYLINDER IT REMAINED MORE PLIABLE. OBVIOUSLY THE GASKET SEEMS TO HOLD UP BETTER CLOSER TO CYLINDER 1 BECAUSE IT IS COOLER THERE - THAT IS WHERE THE PASSAGE FOR THE COOLANT IS. THIS PROBLEM CAUSES A P0304 CODE TO GET THROWN. THAT IS A MISFIRE AT CYLINDER 4. AGAIN, IF THIS WERE SOME RANDOM PROBLEM - COULDN'T WE REASONABLY EXPECT A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE CYLINDER MISFIRE CODE FROM P0301, 302, 303, AND 304? BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE. I DON'T THINK I HAVE SEEN ANY POSTS ON ANYTHING OTHER THAN P0304. THERE IS EXTRA HEAT AROUND CYLINDER 4 ABOVE WHAT THE GASKET MATERIAL IS RATED FOR - WHICH IS AN ENGINE DESIGN ISSUE.    2 CARS VERIFIED SO FAR HAPPEN TO BE CALIFORNIA EMISSION VEHICLES IT SEEMS PLAUSIBLE  THAT THE EXTRA HEAT IS RELATED TO THE EMISSION CONTROL DEVICES THESE CARS HAVE - SPECIFICALLY THE EXTRA CAT CONVERTER.  *JB",

THE FIRST, WITNESSED BY MY HUSBAND & SON, OCCURRED ON DECEMBER 26, 2003.  APPROACHING A RED LIGHT, I SLOWED TO A STOP WITH MY FOOT SQUARELY ON THE BRAKE.  THE ENGINE SUDDENLY RACED ALARMINGLY AND THE CAR TRIED TO LURCH THROUGH THE LIGHT.  I PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND THE ENGINE RACING INCREASED.  I TURNED THE CAR OFF.  THE HEAD MECHANIC AT OUR LOCAL DEALERSHIP HAD NO IDEAS.  AGAINST MY BETTER JUDGMENT, I TOOK THE CAR BACK.  THE NEXT WEEKEND, IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  I PULLED BACKWARDS OUT OF A PARKING SPOT, PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE, AND THE ENGINE SUDDENLY TOOK OFF.  THE RPMS REGISTERED WITHIN SECONDS UP TO 6500 RPMS.  PUT IN NEUTRAL, THE RPMS INCREASED TO 7000 RPMS.  I TURNED THE CAR OFF.  I TOLD OUR LOCAL NISSAN DEALERSHIP THAT I WOULD NOT DRIVE THE CAR UNTIL THIS DANGEROUS PROBLEM WAS DIAGNOSED AND FIXED.  ON THE NISSAN HOTLINE (1-800-NISSAN-1), THE CUSTOMER RELATIONS REPRESENTATIVES TOLD ME: (1) THEIR TECHNICAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH THIS PROBLEM (NISSAN LATER SAID THAT, ALTHOUGH THEY HAD RECEIVED CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS, THEY HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO REPLICATE THE PROBLEM IN A SHOP); AND (2) IF THE PROBLEM COULD NOT BE \"REPLICATED\" IN SHOP, THEN, IN EFFECT, \"THERE WAS NO PROBLEM\" AND NO REMEDY.  I WENT ONLINE AND FOUND THAT S.U.A. IS A MAJOR PROBLEM NATIONALLY.  I COULD NOT DRIVE THIS CAR, COULD NOT ALLOW A FAMILY MEMBER TO DRIVE THIS CAR, AND COULD NOT SELL THE CAR.  AFTER ALMOST SIX WEEKS WITHOUT MY CAR, I TRADED IT BACK TO THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP AT CONSIDERABLE LOSS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO TRY TO REPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND WOULD NOT RE-SELL THE VEHICLE TO AN UNINFORMED CONSUMER.   I HAVE 35 YEARS OF SOLID DRIVING EXPERIENCE.  THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF DRIVER ERROR HERE.

ONE DEALERSHIP EVEN REPLACED THE ENTIRE BRAKING SYTEM IN AUGUST 2001- IN DECEMBER 2001 - ANOTHER DEALERSHIP IS TELLING ME THAT THERE IS NO WAY THE BRAKING SYSTEM WAS REPLACED BECAUSE MY BRAKES WERE VERY WORN AND GLAZED/DUSTED OVER AGAIN OR THAT THERE IS SOME KIND OF PROBLEM CAUSING THE BRAKES TO WEAR AT AN AMAZINGLY FAST RATE!!!!!!!!!  I HAVE WRITTEN A 7 PAGE LETTER -SENT COPIES OF SERVICE BILLS - REQUESTED A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE -BEEN FRUSTRATED WITH SERVICE-WASTED MANY HOURS FROM WORK, AND HOME IN DEALING WITH DEALERSHIPS AND NISSAN NORTH AMERICA AND NEIGHTER WILL ADMIT THAT THEY EITHER CAN'T FIX THE PROBLEM OR THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT.  WE HAVE HAD THE RUN AROUND FOR 2.5 YEARS....THE PROBLEM GETS FIXED TEMPORARILY AND THEN COMES RIGHT BACK.  NISSAN NORTH AMERICA IS TELLING ME THAT I HAVE TO LET THEM TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT MY BRAKES AND GIVE THEM ANOTHER CHANCE TO FIX THIS ONGOING PROBLEM.  MY LAST VISIT FOR REPAIRS WAS AROUND MAY ? 2002 - THE BRAKES ARE ONCE AGAIN STARTING TO MAKE A DEEP, LOUD RUMBLE WHEN APPLYING BRAKES -SOUNDS TO BE IN THE REAR END OF THE CAR.  HOWEVER, THE NOISE IS NOT ALWAYS PRESENT WHEN USING THE BRAKES.- SOMETIMES IT HAPPENS MORE IN DAMP WEATHER.  ALSO, ONCE THE RUMBLE GETS REESTABLISHED...IT BECOME VERY LOUD, VERY OBVIOUS.
