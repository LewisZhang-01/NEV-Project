IT FELT AS IF IT WAS SLIPPING OR IT JUST WASN'T GETTING ANY POWER. MY OIL PRESSURE SENSOR HAD WENT OUT WITHOUT ME KNOWING AT THE TIME SO I THOUGHT THE PROBLEM HAD TO DEAL WITH MY OIL PUMP. I FINALLY TOOK IT BACK TO THE MECHANIC I USED BEFORE AND HE RAN A DIAGNOSTIC TEST ON MY TRUCK DUE TO HIM NOT FINDING ANY ISSUES BESIDES MY OIL PRESSURE SENSOR WAS DEFECTIVE. THE DIAGNOSTIC CAME BACK WITH MULTIPLE CODES AND 3 OF THEM HAD TO DEAL WITH THE TRANSMISSION. I DECIDED TO TAKE MY TRUCK TO MY BROTHER AND HAVE HIM LOOK AT IT FOR A SECOND OPINION.

I TOUCHED THE LINES AND THEY WERE FALLING APART AND FLAKING OFF METAL AT THE TOUCH. I CONTACTED CHEVROLET AND IT WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER. THEY QUOTED ME $1,100 TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM. MY TRUCK IS A 2006 I BOUGHT IT BRAND NEW IT HAS 59,500 MILES ON IT AND I PAID RIGHT AT $50,000 FOR MY TRUCK. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN IN LESS THAN 10 YEARS OF OWNERSHIP. THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE SINCE CHEVROLET USED INFERIOR AND CHEAP PRODUCTS IN THEIR TRUCKS. THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THIS. SOMEONE COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED THE OTHER DAY WHEN I WAS DRIVING. I REPLACED ALL OF THE ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS AND ONE CALIPER NOT 9 MONTHS AGO. I NEVER THOUGHT THAT MY METAL LINES WERE COMPROMISED UNTIL I HAD A FAILURE. I HAVE LOST ALOT OF FAITH IN GM DUE TO THIS ISSUE. I AM STILL WORKING WITH GM AND THE DEALER TO GET THE PROBLEM RESOLVED, BUT IT IS NOT LOOKING GOOD. I AM WONDERING HOW MANY OTHER VEHICLES ARE COMPROMISED. I WAS TALKING TO MY UNCLE THE OTHER DAY AND A GENTLEMAN OVERHEARD MY CONVERSATION. HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD A 2003 2500 CHEVROLET THE BRAKES ALSO FAILED ON. HE WAS TOWING A TRAILER AND TOATLED HIS TRUCK. I AM COMPLETELY OUT OF WARRANTY AS OF NEXT MONTH. GM SAYS TO KEEP MY BILL FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE LINES THAT I MAY GET PAID BACK.

I REMOVED THE FRONT WHEEL SPEED SENSORS, CLEANED THE CORROSION FROM THE MOUNTING PADS AND REASSEMBLED. BEFORE CLEANING THE SENSOR MOUNTING THE PROBLEM WOULD OCCUR 80-90% OF THE TIME BRAKES WERE APPLIED. AFTER CLEANING IT HAS NOT HAPPENED AGAIN. THERE IS A RECALL ON THIS VERY ISSUE ON EARLIER YEAR MODELS, CLEARLY THIS NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED TO MORE MODEL YEARS.

I LOOKED UNDER THE TRUCK, AND SAW THE FLUID LEAKING FROM A HEAVILY CORRODED BRAKE LINE. WHEN I GOT THE TRUCK HOME, I DID A MORE THOROUGH INSPECTION, AND DISCOVERED THAT ALL THE BRAKE LINES WERE HEAVILY CORRODED, AND WOULD NEED REPLACEMENT. I ORDERED AN AFTERMARKET, PRE-BENT STAINLESS LINE KIT. I TOOK THE TRUCK TO A LOCAL MECHANIC WHO WAS ABLE TO REPLACE THE LEAKING LINE, AND A FEW OTHERS, BUT WAS UNABLE TO REPLACE THE LINES GOING INTO THE ABS MODULE DUE TO THEIR LOCATION ON TOP OF THE FRAME, UNDER THE CAB. I AM ABLE TO DRIVE THE TRUCK NOW, BUT WILL NEED TO FIND ANOTHER MECHANIC WHO IS WILLING TO SEPARATE THE CAB FROM THE FRAME TO REPLACE THE REST OF THE LINES. I HAVE OWNED MANY VEHICLES OVER THE YEARS, AND NONE HAVE EVER HAD A CORRODED BRAKE LINE.

OCTOBER 2011 TOOK VEHICLE TO GM CERTIFIED SERVICE CENTER FOR THE CONTINUING ABS ISSUE.  CORROSION WAS A MAIN FACTOR IN CAUSING THE SPEED SENSORS TO FAIL.

IT TOOK SEVERAL MONTHS FOR IT TO GET CONSISTENT FOR ANYONE ELSE TO HEAR IT THEN IT BEGAN TO GET A LOT WORSE. I TOOK IT BY MY MECHANIC AND HE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS IN THE STEERING. HE SAID THAT THEY USE TO JUST LUBE THEM AGAIN BUT NOW YOU HAVE TO ORDER A KIT FROM THE  MANUFACTURE. HE KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS IMMEDIATELY AFTER DRIVING IT THROUGH THE PARKING LOT BECAUSE HE HAD THE VERY SAME PROBLEM ON HIS CHEVY TRUCK IN THE PAST AND HAD SEEN SEVERAL OTHERS SINCE THEN. HE INFORMED ME IT WAS SAFE TO DRIVE FOR NOW AND I HAVE YET TO GET IT FIXED. YOU CAN TELL IT IS A LUBRICATION PROBLEM BECAUSE IT IS NOT AS NOTICEABLE IN THE WINTER VS. THE SUMMER WHEN IT IS HOTTER AND THE LUBE FLOWS MORE FREELY. NOW I SEE THE SAME COMPLAINT ON HERE AND OTHER WEB SITES REGARDING THIS SAME PROBLEM AND THAT  IT WILL KEEP HAPPENING OVER AND OVER. THE KNOCKING HAS BECOME VERY LOUD WHEN I MAKE A TURN EITHER WAY NOW. IF THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL THEN WHY HAS IT NOT BEEN RECALLED? ESPECIALLY IF A OWNER HAS TO CONTINUALLY HAVE IT FIXED AFTER EVERY 10-20 THOUSAND MILES. I AM AFRAID THAT IF IT IS NOT FIXED SOON I MAY LOSE CONTROL OF THE STEERING. I HAVE ALSO NOTICED A LOT OF WEAR ON MY TIRES THAT SHOULD NOT BE THERE AFTER KEEPING IT CONTINUALLY MAINTAINED. MY TRUCK IS FIVE YEARS OLD BUT IT ONLY HAS AROUND 25,000 MILES ON IT.

IT IS VERY LIKELY, FROM WHAT I HAVE READ FROM OTHER OWNERS' REPORTS, THAT THE PROBLEM IS NOT EXCLUSIVE TO THE YEAR 2006. IT MAY WELL PERTAIN TO SEVERAL OTHER YEARS FOR THIS MODEL PRODUCED AROUND THE SAME TIME.    I PURCHASED A NEW CHEVROLET SILVERADO 1500 PICKUP IN SEPTEMBER OF 2006. ONLY A SHORT TIME AFTER THE 36,000 MILE WARRANTY ENDED I HAD TO REPLACE THE WHEEL BEARING ASSEMBLY ON THE PASSENGER'S SIDE. THE LICENSED MECHANIC REPLACED IT WITH A UNIVERSAL BEARING FOR A COST TO ME OF $250. THIS WAS A MUCH BETTER PRICE THAN OTHER ESTIMATES I RECEIVED.  THIS OCCURRED IN 2008.   AFTER ONLY 15 MONTHS, THIS SAME BEARING HAD TO BE REPLACED AGAIN AT ANOTHER EXPENSE OF $250.  THE MECHANIC DETERMINED IN BOTH INSTANCES THAT THE DAMAGE WAS CAUSED BY EXTENSIVE RUST ON THE HUBS OF THE ASSEMBLY DUE TO POOR DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM. THE AREA WHERE WE LIVE HAS AN ELEVATION OF 4200 FEET. WE LIVE ALONG THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS OF NORTHWESTERN NORTH CAROLINA, WHERE THE WINTERS ARE QUITE SEVERE WITH ICY ROADS AND THEREFORE NEEDING TO BE TREATED WITH SALT DURING MUCH OF THE WINTER MONTHS.  THIS RUST IS LEADING TO DAMAGE TO THE ABS SYSTEM OR BRAKE LINE AS THE SALT GETS INTO THE BEARING.  THIS THEN IS CAUSING AN UNSAFE CONDITION IN WHICH A MUCH LONGER STOPPING DISTANCE TAKES PLACE WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED. IN ADDITION, IT CAUSES A JERKING OR GRABBING MOTION RATHER THAN THE USUALLY SMOOTH MOVEMENT OF NORMAL ANTI-LOCKING BRAKING SYSTEMS.  TODAY, FOR THE THIRD TIME SINCE OWNING THE TRUCK, I HAVE AGAIN HAD TO REPLACE ONE OF THE WHEEL-BEARING ASSEMBLIES. THIS TIME IS WAS TO THE DRIVER'S SIDE ASSEMBLY WHICH MAKES A REPLACEMENT BEING NEEDED TWICE TO THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEEL AND ONCE TO THE DRIVER SIDE WHEEL.  *TR",

WITHIN  WEEKS, THE REPLACED LINE FAILED AND THE DEALER INFORMED US THAT MANY TRUCKS OF THE SAME DESIGN WERE FAILING FOR THE SAME PART. IT TOOK WEEKS TO GET A REPLACEMENT PART FOR GM. FEED BACK FROM OTHER GM DEALERS INDICATED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS WIDE  SPREAD. WHEN A REPLACEMENT PART WAS FINALLY PROVIDED, WE WERE INFORMED BY GM WESTERN REGION SERVICE THAT A DESIGN \"FIX\" HAD BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND THAT THE TRUCK WAS SAFE TO DRIVE. THREE WEEKS AGO, (45,000 MILES) MY TRUCK STARTED LEAKING TRANSMISSION FLUID AGAIN. AN INSPECTION BY THE DEALER REVEALED THAT NOT ONLY THE SAME LINE WAS LEAKING AGAIN BUT THAT TWO OTHER LINES OF THE SAME DESIGN  WERE ALSO LEAKING. THIS DEALER, E&L MOTORS IN KEMMERER HAD ALREADY SEEN MORE THAN A DOZEN TRUCKS IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM AND WAS FRUSTRATED BECAUSE REPLACEMENT LINES FROM GM WOULD START LEAKING WITHIN DAYS OF  INSTALLATION. WE WERE TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT THERE WAS A RUMOR THAT GM WOULD BE DOING A RECALL ON THIS PART. IN THE MEAN TIME, I AM NOT GETTING ANY DIRECT INFORMATION AND THE CORRECTIVE ACTION GM IS TELLING IT'S DEALERS IS TO HAVE THE  OWNER CHECK THE TRANSMISSION FLUID FREQUENTLY, A SPECIAL FLUID WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH ANYONE EXCEPT AN AUTHORIZED GM DEALER. RECENT CONTACTS WITH OTHER GM DEALERS HAVE EXPOSED THE SAME PROBLEM WITH \"DOZENS\" OF TRUCKS IN OUR AREA WHICH ARE ALSO WAITING FOR A RELIABLE REPLACEMENT PART.  I USE THIS TRUCK FOR WORK.

THE DESIGN OF THE CAB IS SUCH THAT THERE IS ONLY A  1.5 X 1.5 FT BOX THAT ONE CAN SEE OUT OF. THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS SO BIG AND MOUNTED SO LOW THAT IT BLOCKS MOST OF THE VISION TO THE RIGHT FRONT OF THE VEHICLE AND THE TOP OF THE CAB INHIBITS THE ABILITY TO SEE STOP LIGHTS WHEN STOPPED AT A STOP BAR, TO SEE THE LIGHT ONE MUST STOP A VEHICLE LENGTH SHORT OF THE LIGHT. STOPPING SHORT TO SEE THE LIGHT ISN'T A BIG ISSUE FOR THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK, ITS THE IDIOT WITH ROAD RAGE BEHIND THAT'S THE PROBLEM..I HAVE ASKED THE CHEVY CUSTOMER CARE CENTER TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AS WELL AS OTHER ISSUES WITH THE SUITABILITY OF THIS TRUCK FOR PERSONS TALLER THAN 5 FT BUT I THINK THEY HAVE JUST WRITTEN OFF THE COMPLAINT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THIS VEHICLE BE RECALLED DO TO THE SEVERELY LIMITED VISION OF THE DRIVER. FROM NHTSA WEB SITE.  *NM",

THIS IS STARTLING TO SAY THE LEAST.  IT HAS HAPPENED TO US GOING UP HILLS AND AROUND HILLY CURVES.  IF I DID NOT KEEP BOTH HANDS ON THE WHEEL I VERY WELL COULD HAVE LOST CONTROL AND CRASHED.
