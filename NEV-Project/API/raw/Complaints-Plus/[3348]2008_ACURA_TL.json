The VSA light, as well as the engine, oil, abs and battery lights all started flashing on the dash and the car turned off. The steering wheel locked up and I had to throw it in neutral, turning the key back and forth from the off position to the start position to get it to unlock right before I crashed into on coming traffick!

Oddly enough it seemed to appear literally overnight. I\u2019ve noticed the crack seems to expand when in cooler temperatures, however the crack appears to fuse back together  when the temperature is warmer and/or hot outside, which is concerning in itself. My vehicle has been stored in a garage since it\u2019s purchase and when not in use a sunshade is used to protect the dash when exposed outside. I am very concerned that there may be a bigger problem with the air bag system that may result in the air bags being inadvertently deployed resulting in an accident, injury or even greater death. Internet searches reveal this a common problem among individuals similarly situated with the same make and model, and Acura is apparently aware. My vehicle is regularly serviced and maintained at the Acura Dealership in Memphis. I have reached out to the dealership regarding this issue, however I have not heard back from them regarding a possible resolution. I believe this issue warrants some type of safety recall before someone or their loved ones become seriously injured.",

I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO ACURA AND THEY, AFTER TAKING PICTURES AND CONTACTING THEIR CORPORATE OFFICE ,ACURA TOLD ME I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE SEAT IN IT'S ENTIRETY AND HALF OF THE COST TO REPLACE THE DASHBOARD.  THEY SAID DASHBOARDS CRACK IN SOUTH FLORIDA AND THEY WOULD ONLY PAY FOR PART OF THE REPLACEMENT AND THE SEAT WAS OLD AND WAS NORMAL WEAR.  AGAIN, RARELY DID ANYONE RIDE WITH ME IN MY CAR. ADDITIONALLY, WHEN I TOOK THE CAR TO PEMBROKE PINES ACURA TO HAVE IT EXAMINED, THEY SAID THE CENTER CONSOLE COVER WAS ALSO BAD AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED--TOTALLY AT MY COST.  I HAVE LIVED IN SOUTH FLORIDA MY ENTIRE LIFE AND THE LAST CAR I OWNED THAT HAD A DASHBOARD CRACK WAS BACK IN THE 1970'S.
