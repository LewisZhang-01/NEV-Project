IT IS A LIMITED 4X4 MODEL WITH A 5.7L HEMI MULTI DISPLACEMENT ENGINE. UPON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WHEN REFUELING THE VEHICLE, SECONDS AFTER THE FUEL NOZZLE CLICKS OFF A GUSHING SHOULD IS HEARD AND IMMEDIATELY A SPRAY OF GASOLINE IS EJECTED FROM THE FILLER NECK. IT HAS BECOME TOO DANGEROUS TO FILL THE TANK AND I MUST RESORT TO PURCHASING A LESS THAN FULL TANK. NOT ONLY IS THIS ANNOYING BUT IT ALSO PRESENTS AN EXTREME FIRE AND EXPLOSION HAZARD DUE TO THE QUANTITY OF GASOLINE EJECTED. BOTH MYSELF AND SEVERAL GAS STATION ATTENDANTS HAVE BEEN SOAKED IN GASOLINE BY THIS DEFECT OF NOT SHUTTING OFF THE FILLER CHECK VALVE WHEN FULL.  I BELIEVE THE 2005-2006 MODELS OF THIS SAME VEHICLE WERE RECALLED FOR A SIMILAR PROBLEM WHICH REQUIRED REPLACING THE ENTIRE FUEL TANK AND FILLER PIPE AS AN ASSEMBLY.

ON 03/22/10 I CALLED KARI AGAIN AND REPORTED TO THEM THE DURANGO IS STILL STALLING/HESITATING/LUNGING.
