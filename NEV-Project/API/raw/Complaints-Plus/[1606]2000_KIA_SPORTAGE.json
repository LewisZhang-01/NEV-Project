THE PROBLEM PERSISTED AND WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR IN FOR IT'S NEXT OIL CHANGE I HAD IT CHECKED OUT. THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THE GAS TANK AND THE SHIELD WERE CORRODING. HE EXPLAINED TO ME THAT KIA HAS HAD THIS ON GOING PROBLEM FOR SOMETIME AND THAT THE TANK WITH IT'S PARTS WERE DEFECTIVE. THAT THERE WAS A RECALL AND TO CONTACT KIA. FIRST I WENT ONLINE TO RESEARCH TO SEE IF THERE WAS A RECALL AND THERE IS. I THEN CONTACTED KIA HEADQUARTERS AND WAS TOLD TO TAKE IT TO A KIA DEALERSHIP TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT.THAT THERE WAS A RECALL. I DID JUST THAT.. I BROUGHT IT TO LOMAN FORD KIA IN WOODBRIDGE NJ. HERE'S WHERE IT GETS CONFUSING. I LEFT MY KIA THERE AND LATER ON THAT DAY THEY CALLED ME. THEY TOLD ME THAT THE TANK AND SHIELD NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, BUT THAT IT WASN'T COVERED. BEING VERY CONFUSED I SAID THAT I SPOKE TO KIA AND I WAS TOLD OF THE RECALL PROBLEM. HE TOLD ME THAT I WAS NOT COVERED BY THE RECALL BECAUSE MY WARRANTY EXPIRED WHICH WAS 100,000 MILES OR TEN YEARS. I HAVE 173,000 MILES. HE SAID THAT THE RECALL IS ONLY ACKNOWLEDGED IF THE CAR IS IN WARRANTY. I TOLD HIM THATS A BUNCH OF CRAP. I SAID IT'S BEEN RECALLED BY THE DEALER AND THE DEALER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPLACEMENT FREE OF CHARGE REGARDLESS OF WARRANTY THATS THE PURPOSE OF A RECALL. HE AGAIN SAID IT'S NOT COVERED.

IT'S A SYSTEM THAT WORKS BY AIR PRESSURE TO ENGAGE THE 4X4.  THE DEFECT WITH THIS PART IS THAT AIR LEAKS OUT OF IT AND CAUSES THE 4X4 TO STOP WORKING.  KIA HAS MADE A NEW VERSION OF THIS PART (PART # QK082-33-020-EQ) THAT CORRECTS THE ISSUE BY DOUBLE SEALING THE AIR PRESSURE LEAK.  THEY ARE NOT HOWEVER WILLING TO MAKE THE REPAIRS FREE OF CHARGE, WHICH I THINK THEY SHOULD.      THE REASON WHY THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE IS BECAUSE THIS CAR HAS REAR WHEEL DRIVE AND WE LIVE IN UTAH WHERE IT SNOWS EVERY WINTER.  REAR WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLES IN SNOW-COVERED ROADS ARE USELESS AND CANNOT BE CONTROLLED.  WE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE FOR THE 4X4 FACTOR THAT MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN SNOWY WEATHER.  WE ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FACT THAT THE COMPANY IS NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY TO CORRECT THE ISSUE FREE OF CHARGE, ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS IS A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT AND A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE IN THIS KIND OF WEATHER.  I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THIS DEFECT WAS ALSO IN THE 98, 99, 00 AND 01 MODELS OF THIS CAR.  UNFORTUNATELY FOR ME I DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT THIS UNTIL AFTER THE PART BROKE.      CURRENTLY WE ARE NOT DRIVING THIS VEHICLE WHEN THE ROADS ARE COVERED WITH SNOW.  WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BUY THE $800.00 PART + LABOR FEES.

PUDDLES OF GAS WERE LATER SPOTTED UNDER MY VEHICLE, SO THE FOLLOWING MORNING (OCTOBER 24, 2005), I BROUGHT IT TO THE LOCAL KIA DEALER FOR INSPECTION.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE GAS TANK HAD \"ROTTED/RUSTED\" OUT (ADDITIONALLY, THE BOLTS FOR THE GAS TANK AND THE HOSE CONNECTING THE GAS TANK AND FILLER TUBE WERE RUSTED AND DISINTEGRATED, RESPECTIVELY, BEYOND REPAIR AND MUST BE REPLACED), CREATING A HOLE THROUGH WHICH GAS WAS ESCAPING.  THE VEHICLE WAS USED ONLY MINIMALLY IN WI PRIOR TO AUGUST 2000, AND ITS LOCATION SINCE THEN HAS BEEN CHAPEL HILL/DURHAM, NC (ALL REPAIR WORK AND OIL CHANGES HAVE BEEN DONE BY MILLENNIUM KIA IN DURHAM, NC, WHICH ALSO SUGGESTS WHERE THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN DRIVEN SINCE AUGUST 2000).  THUS, THE VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN EXPOSED TO SALT OR OTHER ELEMENTS WHICH MAY LEAD TO THIS TYPE OF DAMAGE.  IT CURRENTLY HAS FEWER THAN 55,000 MILES ON IT, WHICH FURTHER LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS NOT THE DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF OVER- OR MISUSE.  MY FATHER [XXX] AND OWNER OF THE VEHICLE, CONTACTED THE KIA CORPORATION AND SPOKE WITH TOM MORALES (800-333-4542, EXT: 45262) REGARDING THIS ISSUE, AND A CASE HAS BEEN OPENED WITH REGARD TO IT (CASE #[XXX]).  WE BELIEVE THIS DAMAGE IS NOT ONLY EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS, BUT ALSO PREMATURE AND THE RESULT OF A FAULTY PRODUCT.  KIA CLAIMS THEY CAN DO NOTHING TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE, BUT BECAUSE OF ITS SERIOUS POTENTIAL TO CAUSE INJURY, WE BELIEVE THE CASE MERITS FURTHER INVESTIGATION.  *NM UPDATED 07/18/2012 *JS    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",

THE ISSUE IS THAT SINCE I PURCHASED THIS CAR I HAVE HAD IN THEIR SERVICE SHOP AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR FOR SEVERAL PROBLEMS.  NOW IT IS BACK IN FOR THE THIRD TIME FOR TWO PROBLEMS THAT THEY CLAIM HAD BEEN FIXED TWO TIMES PRIOR.  I HAVE A STEERING WHEEL AIRBAG THAT KEEPS DISAPPEARING WHICH CAUSES A PROBLEM FOR ME WHEN I NEED TO HONK THE HORN AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT KEEPS COMING ON.  NOW THE 3 YEARS HAVE PASTED, NOT THE 36000 MILES BUT THEY WILL NOT FIX THESE PROBLEMS WITHOUT ME PAYING FOR IT UPFRONT BECAUSE THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED.      I JUST FEEL THAT THEY SHOULD HONOR THE 36000 NOT THE 3 YEAR IT IS NOT LIKE THIS IS A NEW PROBLEM.  I WOULD HAVE UNDERSTOOD IF I NEVER BROUGHT THE CAR IN BEFORE FOR THESE PROBLEMS BUT THIS IS SUPPOSEDLY A NEW CAR AND IT HAS ALREADY BEEN IN TWICE FOR THE SAME PROBLEMS.

THE 4 WHEEEL DRIVE WENT OUT. THEY SAID IT HAPPENS SINCE THERE IS NO DIRT SHIELD ON THE LINKAGE. THEY INSTALLED A RETROFIT KIT TO PROTECT AGAINST THIS BUT ONLY DO IT IF PEOPLE HAVE PROBLEMS. I THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO GET OUT OF HAVING A RECALL ON THIS ITEM. WITH OUR KIA THEY REPLACED THE ENTIRE BRAKE ASSEMBLEY AFTER ONLYU 3206 MI. WE HAD THE CAR IN 3X AFTER THAT FOR BRAKE SQUEEL WHICH WAS EXCESSIVE. THEY COULD NOT FIX IT. THEY REPLACED THE ROTORS AGAIN AT 10456 MILES. AT 12552 MILES THE 4 WHEEL DRIVE WENT OUT. AT 15882 MI THEY CHECKED AGAIN FOR BRAKE PULSATION AND BALANCED FRONT TIRE AND WHEEL ASSEM. SAID BRAKE AND ROTOR RUNOUT WELL WITHIN SPECS. AT 17488 HAD ROTORS REPLACED AGAIN. NOT EVEN 2K MILES AFTER THEY SAID EVERYTHING WAS WELL WITHIN SPECS. AT 20473 MILES BRAKE ROTOR WERE PULSING AGAIN. THEY WOULD NOT COVER UNDER WARRANTY. AFTER TALKING WITH KIA (CASE #K129955) THEY AGREED TO MACHINE THE ROTORS AGAIN USING THE ON CAR LATHE TO GET A BETTER FINISH. AT 20783 COMPLAINED ABOUT BRAKE PULSING AGAIN. AND AM GOING TO TAKE THE VEHICLE IN AGAIN TO FIND OUT WHAT IS GOING ON. I THINK THERE IS AN UNDERLING PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE THAT THEY CANNOT FIGURE OUT. AT 7571 MI, 13777MI, AND AGAIN AT 20783 MI, THE WHEEL BEARINGS WERE LOOSE. THIS IS NOT NORMAL WEAR JUST LIKE THE ROTORS.",
