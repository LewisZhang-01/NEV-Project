On 6/18, I dropped the vehicle off for the scheduled appointment.

The issue persisted and I returned the vehicle to the dealership on 7/1. After several attempts during the month of July 2021 by the dealership to fix the issue and it not being resolved, I finally contacted GMC Corporate to discuss the problems and options. I was assigned a case number and to customer service assistant Farris.  Unfortunately, GMC customer assistance was not very helpful with my claim and was not responsive. At one point, I asked to be referred to a supervisor but was never given that opportunity. Finally, on 8/26, I was advised that based on GMC's evaluation and review of my case, the vehicle would not be replaced or repurchased based on the history of the vehicle repairs. He did not explain to me in detail the basis of this decision. He stated that my options were to take the vehicle back to the Fremont dealership or take it to another a dealership (where I may be charged). I decided to take the vehicle to another dealership which was GMC, Modesto. The appointment was scheduled on 9/14 and the vehicle was returned to me on 9/15 after they could not diagnose or repair the vehicle. The service adviser explained that I would have to return to the dealership in Fremont. On 9/17, the vehicle was towed to that dealership. On 9/23 at 4:55 pm, service manager Dave called stating \"two fuel injectors they put in previously were replaced again and wanted permission for the shop foreman to drive it home.\"",

It has been to the dealer four times, transmission has been re-calibrated, the new and improved fluid flush and these problems still exist. The truck has just under 60K miles and has started downshifting on a regular basis causing the engine to rev. How long is that going to last before the engine blows or causes permanent damage?",

        "summary": "GM has known issues, which I'm sure the NHTSA is aware of.  This involves transmission in 2015-2019 model trucks, both GMC and Chevrolet, among other GM vehicles.  In my research there have been no less than 13 TSB's issues by GM trying to rectify these issues.  The latest TSB states that a new blend of transmission fluid is the fix.  In my instance the transmission started shifting hard with less than 30K miles.  Took to dealership and they reprogrammed the transmission control module.  Fixed the issue for a while but then started back after about 10K miles.  In Feb. 2020 with 60K miles a transmission temperature sensor failed on the transmission.  I took it in to replace sensor and as a result they had to change the fluid at which time they told me they replaced it with the new recommended fluid.  Now at 94K miles it has started producing the hard shuddering at certain speeds.  This is the main problem the fluid change is supposed to fix.  Well guess what.  It does fix it.  I'm now scheduled to take it back in on Monday 8-9-21 to have the torque converter replaced.  The company I work for has about 12 of these model GMC trucks and 7 of them have had to go back in to fix this same issue.  Some of them multiple times.  I'm out of warranty and these repairs are not cheap.  The biggest safety issue is the tranny could fail at any point going down the road and leave me with no drivetrain and potentially get hit.  In my 40 years of driving and owning 20 vehicles between me, my wife and 3 kids I have never had a tranny fail.  This is the first and GM has know about this issue for years.  They need to be made to fix these issues and replace all transmission that are having issues and repay me the money I've already paid and the money I'll have to pay next week.  This is ridiculous that NHTSA has not gotten involved enough to force GM to correct this.  You need to force the hand of GM to make this right.   You know of the problems, now get it fixed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
