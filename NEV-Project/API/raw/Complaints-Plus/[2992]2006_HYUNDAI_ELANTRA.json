THE REPLACEMENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FREE HOWEVER, I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS ONLY AND ADVISORY AND NOT A RECALL AND WAS MADE TO PAY $50 TO REPLACE THE $7.00 STOP LAMP SWITCH PART. I LATER WENT ONLINE AND DISCOVERED THAT INDEED IT WAS A RECALL AND THE DEALERSHIP HAD SCAMMED ME BY CHARGING LABOR TO REPLACE THE SWITCH. I BELIEVE THESE VEHICLES ARE A DANGER, ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE MAY ALSO BE ISSUES WITH CRUISE CONTROL BY STOP LAMP, AND I AM NOT CERTAIN WITH SEVERAL YEARS AND MILES DRIVING THAT THE REPLACEMENT PART IS STILL FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.

I CALLED MY DEALERSHIP AND THEY CONFIRMED THE RECALL, SAID BRING IT IN THE NEXT DAY AND THEY COULD REPLACE THE FAULTY EQUIPMENT.

I CALLED THE NUMBER AND WAS TOLD THAT ALTHOUGH CARS FROM 2005-2008 WERE ON THE RECALL LIST, MY VIN WASN'T ON THE LIST AND, THEREFORE, WOULD NOT BE COVERED. I MENTIONED HOW I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS THEY SHOULD LOOK A BIT DEEPER INTO THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY MORE CARS FROM THAT TIME PERIOD THAN JUST THOSE ON THAT CURRENT LIST OF AFFECTED CARS ACCORDING TO VIN WERE EXPERIENCING IDENTICAL PROBLEMS AND WERE MADE IN THAT TIME FRAME!

I ACCEPTED THE EXPLANATION AT THE TIME, BUT HAVING SAT IN MY OWN PASSENGER SEAT WHEN I WAS SLEEPY AND MY MOTHER DROVE, I AM DISTURBED THAT DESPITE BEING SEATED UPRIGHT WITH MY SEATBELT SECURELY FASTENED, THE LIGHT WOULD STILL NOT STAY OFF CONSISTENTLY.    I FOUND A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN FOR THIS ISSUE AND BROUGHT IT UP TO THE DEALER AGAIN AT MY LAST CAR SERVICING IN FEB 08, BUT WAS AGAIN TOLD THAT IT DID NOT HAPPEN AT THE SERVICE SHOP, SO IT COULD NOT BE FIXED. I UNDERSTAND THIS CONCEPT, BUT I AM GREATLY CONCERNED THAT MY VEHICLE IS NOT SAFE BECAUSE THE AIR BAGS MAY OR MAY NOT DEPLOY. THE TSB STATES THAT THIS MAY OCCUR WITH SMALLER STATURE ADULTS, BUT I HAVE NO CHILDREN OR VERY SMALL FRIENDS/FAMILY, AND I AM CERTAINLY AVERAGE SIZED AND THE LIGHT STILL GOES ON AND OFF.    MY CONCERNS ARE ONLY ASSUAGED BY THE FACT THAT I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP MECHANIC THAT IT IS JUST A LIGHT SENSOR AND THAT THE AIR BAGS WILL ALWAYS DEPLOY IF THE SEATBELT IS BUCKLED. I HOPE THAT THIS IS TRUE, BUT AFTER READING OTHER COMMENTS ON THIS SITE ABOUT AIR BAGS NOT DEPLOYING, MY ANXIETY ABOUT THE SAFETY OF MY VEHICLE HAS INCREASED. I PLAN TO WRITE A LETTER TO HYUNDAI REGARDING THIS MATTER BUT I AM NOT SURE IF MY CONCERNS WILL BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY, SO I AM HOPING THAT THIS ENTRY WILL HELP TO BRING MORE ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE.

PERSONALLY I HAD EXPERIENCED THIS A COUPLE OF TIMES PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT.  THE GAS PEDAL IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER  AND CLOSE TO BRAKE PEDAL AND IT APPEARS TO BE VERY EASY TO PUSH BOTH DOWN. I ALMOST DROVE INTO THE SIDE OF  AN ONCOMING CAR ENTERING THE ROAD. ON MY TOYOTA HIGHLANDER THE BRAKE PEDAL IS HIGHER THAN THE GAS PEDAL , MAYBE THE TRANSITION TO THIS OTHER PEDAL ARRANGEMENT IS PART OF THE ISSUE. *JB",
