THERE IS NOTHING MORE TO SAY THAN THAT SINCE IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST. WHEN I FINALLY GOT A GOOD LOOK AT MY BIKE - THE RIGHT HAND FORK FAILED OR BROKE NEAR THE BOTTOM. I BELIEVE THAT THIS FORK FAILURE IS WHAT CAUSED MY ACCIDENT.  AFTER READING AND SEARCHING MORE INFORMATION ON THE INTERNET I SEE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME IT HAS BEEN REPORTED. PLEASE REFER TO # PE09026 - WHICH IS THE EARLIER PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY NHTSA.    UPDATED 07/08/11  *BF  UPDATED 08/19/11*JB",
