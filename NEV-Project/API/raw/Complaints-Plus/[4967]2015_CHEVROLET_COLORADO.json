Power steering could have gone out at any time while I was driving and the weight of the vehicle could have caused a serious accident, depending on when and where it happened, seeing as how I could not budge the steering wheel. I contacted Chevrolet and was told my vehicle \"wasn't covered\" under the recall. They had no desire to assist me in any way. The mechanic I took the truck to is having trouble ordering the part because it is on nationwide backorder. I wonder why? If they can even fix it, it will cost me close to two thousand dollars at this point, for a safety issue that should be covered by Chevrolet.

I PULLED OVER TURNED MY VEHICLE OFF AND THE ALERTS CLEARED IMMEDIATELY.   ON THE SECOND OCCASION A WEEK LATER, I WAS PULLING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY AT A LOW RATE OF SPEED AND THE SAME LIGHTS ILLUMINATED AND POWER STEERING WAS LOST. I AGAIN SHUT THE CAR OFF HOWEVER THE FAILURES STAYED PRESENT AND REMAINED PRESENT UNTIL THE FOLLOWING DAY. I DROVE TO WORK WITH NO POWER STEERING WITH THE INTENTION OF TAKING IT TO THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP CLOSEST TO MY OFFICE.   WHILE AT WORK I RESEARCHED MY VIIN AND NOTICED GM ISSUED A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM ON MARCH 25TH, 3 DAYS AFTER MY FIRST FAILURE AND 3 DAYS PRIOR TO THE SECOND. I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY STATED NO REMEDY WAS AVAILABLE ON THE RECALL AND I NEEDED TO CONTACT GM TO OBTAIN APPROVAL TO HAVE THE WORK DONE AT THE DEALERSHIP UNDER RECALL WORK. I CONTACTED GM AND WAS TOLD ALTHOUGH THERE'S AN ACTIVE RECALL FOR MY VIIN, I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE MY VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP AND PAY FOR THE REPAIRS. IF GM IS AWARE OF A SAFETY ISSUE AND ISSUED A RECALL, WHY SHOULD I THE CONSUMER PAY FOR THE REPAIRS? I WAS TOLD A MANGER WOULD CONTACT ME FOR FURTHER RESOLUTION AND HAVE YET TO BE CONTACTED.   YESTERDAY, ONE DAY AFTER SPEAKING TO GM I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE TOTAL LOSS OF POWER STEERING FOR THE 3RD TIME AND IT HAS YET TO CLEAR ITSELF AND I'M EXPECTING THE INTERMITTENT PROBLEM IS NOW A PERMANENT ONE.

THE FOLLOWING MORNING I BROUGHT THE TRUCK INTO PREMIER CHEVY IN BUENA PARK AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS MOST LIKELY A FAULTY BATTERY. HE STATED THAT THE OTHER POSSIBILITY WAS THE STEERING GEARBOX BUT HE HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING WHICH WAS THE ISSUE SO HE SUGGESTED WE GET BOTH REPLACED. I DECIDED TO WAIT ON THOSE REPAIRS BECAUSE THE COST EXCEEDED $2K AND I DO NOT HAVE THOSE KINDS OF FUNDS. ON 1/18/20 MY WIFE WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY FROM FULLERTON CA TO SAN DIMAS CA. SHE WAS IN THE LEFT LANE WHEN THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT AGAIN WHEN THE SAME DASHBOARD WARNING APPEARED. SHE HAD TO PULL OVER TO THE LEFT SHOULDER ON THE HIGHWAY TO ATTEMPT TO RESTART THE TRUCK BECAUSE SHE HAD VERY LIMITED MOBILITY. ON HER DRIVE, SHE HAD TO PULL OVER AND ATTEMPT TO RESTART THE TRUCK ON THE LEFT SHOULDER 3 TIMES. 1/20/20 WE WENT TO HER FAMILY'S MECHANIC TO GET THEIR DIAGNOSIS FOR FEAR GM WAS GIVING US THE INCORRECT INFORMATION. HE STATED THAT THERE WAS A FAULTY PART #84498587. AFTER DOING RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT THIS SAME PART WAS RECALLED ON 1K 2015 CHEVY COLORADO TRUCKS. THAT SAME DAY WE WENT TO GLENDORA CHEVROLET WHERE THEY SAID OUR TRUCK WASN'T UNDER WARRANTY AND WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.

I STOPPED AT AN AUTO PARTS STORE TO PURCHASE  SOME FLUID  AND WHEN RESTARTED THE ENGINE, THE STEERING RETURNED TO NORMAL. THE FOLLOWING MORNING, I TOOK IN TO THE WEBB CHEVROLET IN PLAINFIELD WHERE THEY SAID THE POWER STEERING RACK WAS DEFECTIVE AND THE PART WOULD NOT ARRIVE   UNTIL APRIL 6TH OR 7TH. MY DAUGHTER PANICKED WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND SHE COULD HAVE EASILY RAN INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE IN THE OPPOSITE LANE OF TRAFFIC. THREE DAYS BEFORE I CAME TO ILLINOIS  TO VISIT MY DAUGHTER I PICKED IT UP  FROM MY LOCAL COLORADO  FOR  SEVERE ENGINE OIL LEAK REPAIR.  *TR",

RED LINE INDICATING POTENTIAL DANGEROUS OPERATING CONDITIONS START AT 6500 RPM. SO IN ESSENCE IN ORDER FOR AN OWNER TO ACHIEVE 305 HP THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE OPERATING THEIR TRUCK IN A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS MANNER. EVEN IN THE 2015 COLORADO OWNER?S MANUAL IT INDICATES THE DANGER OF OPERATING ABOVE THE REDLINE? ?DO NOT OPERATE THE ENGINE WITH THE RPM?S IN THE WARNING AREA.?    GM IS STATING THAT SOMEONE CAN ACHIEVE MAXIMUM HP ONLY BY OPERATING THE VEHICLE IN A DANGEROUS MANNER....REALLY?!
