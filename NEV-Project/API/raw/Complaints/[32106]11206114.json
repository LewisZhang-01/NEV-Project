        "summary": "AT APPROXIMATELY 46,000 MILES I WAS DRIVING ON A FREEWAY IN THE RAIN AND FELT THE STEERING WAS A LITTLE \"JERKY\"   I THOUGHT IT WAS THE WET ROAD CONDITION AND WIND.  A FEW MINUTES LATER AN ALERT POPPED UP ON THE DASHBOARD SAYING STEERING FAILURE AND TO PULL OFF ROAD SAFELY.  I WASN'T FAR FROM THE FORD DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR.  AFTER A DIAGNOSTIC WAS DONE, I WAS INFORMED THAT IS WAS THE RACK AND PINION.  THE DEALERSHIP QUOTED ME OVER 3,000.00 TO REPLACE.  AFTER CONSULTING WITH MY RETIRED MECHANIC BROTHER AND ANOTHER MECHANIC FRIEND, THEY SUGGESTED I CONTACT FORD.  IT TOOK OVER 3 WEEKS BUT FORD OFFERED TO TAKE ON PART OF THE COST.  I WAS OUT OF POCKET $855.00 FOR THE REPAIR, BUT WAS ALSO WITHOUT A CAR FOR 3 WEEKS.  I STILL FEEL THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE COVERED THE ENTIRE REPAIR.  I HOPE THIS POST WILL HELP GENERATE A RECALL, AS I'VE SEEN OTHERS WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE.  I'M UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IF A RECALL IS ISSUED, I WILL BE REIMBURSED FOR THE MONEY I PAID FOR THIS REPAIR.  EVERYONE I'VE SPOKEN TO WITH KNOWLEDGE OF CARS AND THEIR MECHANICS AGREE THAT THE RACK AND PINION SHOULD NOT GO OUT BEFORE AT LEAST 100,000. MILES.",
