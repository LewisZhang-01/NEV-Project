        "summary": "THE ACCELERATOR ON MY 1999 MERCURY VILLAGER STICKS IN THE \"UP\" POSITION.  THIS HAS CAUSED SEVERAL NEAR ACCIDENTS WHEN I'VE HAD TO STOMP THE ACCELERATOR TO UNSTICK IT.  THIS IS A PROBLEM WHEN STOPPED IN TRAFFIC BECAUSE IT COULD CAUSE YOU TO RAM INTO THE CAR IN FRONT OF YOU.  ALSO, I HAVE FOUND MYSELF \"STUCK\" IN THE MIDDLE OF INTERSECTIONS.  THE PROBLEM FIRST OCCURRED ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO AND WAS \"FIXED\" BY THE DEALER.  THE PROBLEM HAS NOW BECOME MUCH WORSE AND I WAS TOLD THAT THE THROTTLE BODY WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $420.00.  I SAW FROM THE CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS ON THIS WEBSITE THAT THIS IS A COMMON COMPLAINT FROM MERCURY VILLAGER OWNERS & NISSAN QUEST OWNERS (THE SAME VAN AS A VILLAGER).  I HAVE ASKED PEOPLE AT RANDOM THAT I'VE SEEN DRIVING VILLIAGERS AND MANY OF THEM SAY THEY HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS ISN'T BEING FIXED AS A RECALL SINCE IT IS CLEARLY A SAFETY HAZARD TO HAVE A STUCK ACCELERATOR, AND IT APPEARS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM FOR THE MERCURY VILLAGER & NISSAN QUEST.",
