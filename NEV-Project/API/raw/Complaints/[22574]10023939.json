I KNOW THIS BECAUSE TOYOTA HAS TOLD ME THIS PERSONALLY.  UNFORTUNATELY ONCE THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY, THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE PROBLEM, EVEN THOUGH ACCORDING TO THEIR SERVICE BULLETINS, THE CALIPERS ARE NOT ADEQUATE.  THIS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A FREAK THING SINCE SO MANY TUNDRA OWNERS HAVE EXPRESSED THE SAME PROBLEM, BUT IT SEEMS TOYOTA WILL NOT RECALL THEIR MISTAKE.  THE VIBRATION HAS BEEN THERE SINCE DAY 1.  UNFORTUNATELY, I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS A MAJOR PROBLEM UNTIL I STARTED GOING THROUGH BRAKE PADS AND THE ROTORS WERE GETTING WARPED.   *NLM",
