I USED DUCT TAPE TO CLOSE THE RESULTING GAP AND DROVE HOME TO COLORADO.  I CONTACTED THE MANUFACTURER OF THE MOTOR HOME, FLEETWOOD AND THEY RESPONDED WITH \" THIS CONCERN CAN OCCUR FROM TIME TO TIME ON MOTOR HOMES, DUE TO MANY FACTORS, SUCH AS ROAD CONDITIONS, WEATHER, WEAR & TEAR OF THE GASKET, ETC.\"    I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING.  THIS UNIT HAS ONLY 28000 MILES AND I BELIEVE THIS CONDITION TO BE DANGEROUS.  IF THE WINDSHIELD WERE TO COMPLETELY SEPARATE AND FALL OUT, IT WOULD EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE AN ACCIDENT WOULD NOT BE THE IMMEDIATE RESULT.   *NLM",
