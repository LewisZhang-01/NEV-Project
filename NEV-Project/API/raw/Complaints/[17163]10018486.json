I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE DOOR TRIM FLAPPING AT THE REAR EDGE OF THE PASSENGER DOOR AND SLIDING FORWARD GETTING CAUGHT CLIPPING THE FRONT FENDER WHILE OPENING THE DOOR.   I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WAS A RECALL REGARDING THIS PROBLEM AND  I CALLED CHRYSLER CORP. I WAS TOLD THAT THE RECALL COVERED VEHICLES MANUFACTURED UP TO AUGUST '98.  MY VEHICLE WAS MANUFACTURED ON OCTOBER '98.  I BELIEVE MY VEHICLE SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THIS RECALL DUE TO THE FACT THAT I'M EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM AND THAT MY CAR WAS PRODUCED SO CLOSE TO THE RECALL DEADLINE.  APPARENTLY THE DEFECT THAT WAS TO BE CORRECTED ON CARS PRODUCED AFTER AUGUST '98 WASN'T DONE ON MY VEHICLE.  *NLM",
