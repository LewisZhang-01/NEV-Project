THE FIRST VEHICLE IS A 1996 1500 SUBURBAN WITH 90,000 MILES. THE OTHER IS A 1998 K1500 PICKUP WITH 80,000 MILES. BOTH LEAKS OCCURRED AT THE REAR OF THE BOTTOM INTAKE MANIFOLD. THE MECHANIC PERFORMING THE REPAIR STATES THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH HIS SHOP PERFORMING APPROXIMATELY 5-6 A MONTH IN A TOWN OF ONLY 30,000. THE DEALER DENIES ANY GENERIC PROBLEM. INSPECTION OF THE GASKET IMPLIES A TEMPERATURE RELATED PROBLEM OF THE GASKET BODY THAT UNDERMINES THE SEAL RIDGE. *JB",
