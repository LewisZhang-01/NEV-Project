THE 99 BLAZER DEVELOPED AN OIL LEAK FROM THE OIL LINES AT 33,000 MILES, AND THE 2000 NOW HAS THE SAME OIL LINES LEAKING AT 41,000 MILES. I HAVE HEARD THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THESE VEHICLES, AND ENGINES HAVE BEEN RUINED DUE TO THE OIL LINES. I FEEL THAT GM SHOULD OFFER TO REPLACE THE OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE OIL LINES.",
