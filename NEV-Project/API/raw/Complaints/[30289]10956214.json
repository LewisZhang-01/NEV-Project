THEY TOLD ME THE FIRST TIME A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. THE ACCELERATION HAPPENS NOT IN A REGULAR BASIS BUT SPORADIC. THIS TIME IT HAPPENS WHEN I WAS GOING VERY SLOW AND THERE WERE CHILDREN PLAYING CLOSE TO MY HOME. I WAS VERY SLOW NO MORE 3 TO 5 MILES AND HOUR. I HAD TO HIT THE BREAKS VERY HARD TO STOP SINCE AS I WAS TURNING INTO THE DRIVEWAY THE CAR ACCELERATED ON ITS OWN.",
