        "summary": "THE INTAKE MANIFOLD CRACKED WHILE DRIVING AT ABOUT 65 MILES AN HOUR, WITH NO WARNING. I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE COOLANT LOSE UNTIL A/C STARTED BLOWING HOT AIR. AFTER WALKING 6 MILES TO A PHONE AND A 2 HOUR WAIT FOR A TOW TRUCK, I  WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR TO THE DEALER. WHEN I TOLD SERVICE REP WHAT HAPPENED,, HE SAID \"YOU GOT A CRACKED MANIFOLD.\" IF THIS HAS HAPPENED SO OFTEN THAT THE SERVICE REP CAN TELL YOU WHAT WENT WRONG WITH OUT RAISING THE HOOD, THEN THERE IS A PROBLEM!  FORD MOTOR COMPANY SHOULD BE MADE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM OR GIVE FREE REPLACEMENTS AND FREE LABOR EVERY TIME THIS HAPPENS. THE WEB SITE, \"MY AUTOSTATS.COM\" HAS 138 COMPLAINTS LISTED AT THIS TIME,ON THIS PROBLEM AND NO INVESTIGATIONS OR FINDINGS ARE LISTED.   THIS CAR IS TARGETED TOWARDS THE OLDER DRIVER AND NO ONE WOULD WANT THIS TO HAPPEN TO THEIR PARENTS OR EVEN GRAND PARENTS. *JB",
