WHEN START TO PUTTING GAS ON THE PEDAL THE VAN STUFFERS AND SKIPS GEARS UNTIL IT REACHES 3RD GEAR. THIS IS MAKING IT HARD TO DRIVE AND GAIN SPEED. IT ULTIMATELY NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AGAIN. BUT FORD WON'T REPLACE AGAIN FOR ANOTHER 2500$. IT'S A KNOWN ISSUE THAT THEY KNOW OF BUT WON'T REPLACE MORE THAN ONCE. I ALSO CAN'T TRADE IN MY VEHICLE BECAUSE IT'S WORTH 93% LESS THAN VALUE. THE CAR HAS OTHER KNOWN RECALLS THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.",
