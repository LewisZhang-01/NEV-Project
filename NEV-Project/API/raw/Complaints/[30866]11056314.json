FROM THAT MOMENT ON I HAD TO RAISE MYSELF UP TO BE ABLE TO LOOK OVER THE DASHBOARD. MY SIGHT IS DEFINITELY IMPAIRED AND MAKES DRIVING UNSAFE.   I ALSO FOUND THAT THIS IS A REAL HAZARD IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT. SINCE THE CHAIR IS NOW DETACHED.  THE ESTIMATE TO FIX THIS IS AROUND $1100. THIS IS DEFINITELY A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT AND DANGEROUS. I THINK THIS SHOULD BE UNDER A RECALL BECAUSE OF THE DANGER WHEN IN AN ACCIDENT.",
