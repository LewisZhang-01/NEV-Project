THE FORD DEALERSHIP NOTED ON THE INVOICE THAT THEY HAD CHECKED THE BATTERY AND CHARGE, AND ALL WAS \"OK.\" HOWEVER, WHEN I ASKED THEM WHY IT STALLED AS IT DID, I RECEIVED A SHORT ANSWER THAT THEY \"COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING\" THAT WOULD LEAD TO THAT. THE STALLING WAS NOT NOTED ON THE REPAIR INVOICE. I'M AFRAID OF THIS HAPPENING AGAIN, PARTICULARLY WHEN COMMUTING. THE FOCUS HAS 15,000 MILES ON IT.",
