WE HAVE COME TO FIND OUT THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM IN GENERAL MOTORS VEHICLES WITH THIS ENGINE.  THE ENGINE HAS BEEN IN USE SINCE AT LEAST 1996.  OTHERS HAVE TOLD ME THAT MECHANICS ARE SEEING THIS PROBLEM IN CARS ON A DAILY BASIS.  THE FLUIDS ARE LOST THOUGH THE INTAKE MANIFOLD AND DO NOT LEAVE A TELLTALE STAIN OR RESIDUE UNDER A PARKED CAR.  A REPAIR AT A CHEVROLET DEALER WAS QUOTED TO US AT $900.  WE WERE TOLD THERE WAS NO WARRANTY COVERAGE OR RECALL.  IS THIS PROBLEM BEING RESEARCHED?  IS THERE A RECALL IN THE WORKS?",
