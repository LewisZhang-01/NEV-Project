AFTER 26,000 MILES THE ENGINE DEVELOPED A KNOCKING NOISE.  I WAS INFORMED THE ROLLER BEARING ON THE TIMING CHANGE HAD FAILED.  AFTER PAYING MORE THAN $1,400 FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE ROLLER BEARING AND A NEW TIMING CHAIN, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE TIMING CHAIN PROBLEM HAD DAMAGED ONE OR MORE OF THE VALVES, WHICH REQUIRED THE ENGINE TO BE TORN DOWN AND A VALVE JOB TO BE REQUIRED FOR AN ADDITIONAL COST OF $900.00.  ALL OF THIS TO A CAR WITH ONLY 26,000 MILES.  2 WEEKS AFTER THE ENGINE REPAIRS WERE MADE THE TRANSMISSION STOPPED SHIFTING GEARS.*JB",
