AFTER RESEARCH I NOTICED THAT WAS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM HAPPENING TO MANY FORD FUSION.  WHILE THE 2011 AND 2012 FORD FUSION HAD A RECALL ON THIS ISSUE, THE 2010 MODEL IS NOT INCLUDED.  THE REPAIR IS ESTIMATED AT $1,972.99.   THE DEALER SEEMS AWARE THIS IS A DESIGN FAILURE OF THE 2010 FORD FUSION MAKING IT UNSAFE TO OPERATE AND A RECALL SHOULD BE MADE.  *TR",
