I NOTICED THAT THE WARRANTY ONLY COVERS BRAKE ROTORS UNTIL 12,000 MILES. GIVEN THE VOLUME OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING SIMILAR PROBLEMS, IT SEEMS TO ME THERE IS EITHER A DEFECT IN THE REPLACEMENT PARTS OR A DEFECT IN THE DESIGN ITSELF. SINCE BRAKES ARE NECESSARY FOR SAFE VEHICLE OPERATION, I BELIEVE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE.   I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE ADDRESSED EITHER THROUGH A RECALL OR A PROVEN REPLACEMENT PROCEDURE.   *NLM",
