ALSO, WHEN I THEN TRY TO ACCELERATE BY PUSHING THE GAS PEDAL, THE CAR SLOWS DOWN OR STALLS.  THE ONLY WAY TO CORRECT THE ISSUE IS TO STOP THE CAR, TURN IT OFF, AND RESTART IT.  THIS IS PARTICULARLY FREQUENT WHEN COMING OFF MN-100 AND GETTING ONTO I-394.  I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER TWICE.  THEY KEEP SAYING IT'S THE TIRES.  I HAVE PAID OVER $500 TO HAVE IT FIXED NOW AND THE CAR STILL MALFUNCTIONS.  IN ADDITION, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT HAS BEEN ON THE ENTIRE TIME.",
