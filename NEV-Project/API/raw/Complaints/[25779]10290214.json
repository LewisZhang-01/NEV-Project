I WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT WHEN MY JEEP WOULD NOT STOP WHEN I PUT ON BRAKES. I REARENDED SOMEONE. I HAD A MECHANIC CHECK THIS OUT BEFORE ACCIDENT AND COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG. I HAVE OWNED 3 JEEPS IN MY LIFE TIME AND NEVER HAD PROBLEMS. I HAVE A $3000 REPAIR TO MY CAR BECAUSE OF BRAKE FAILURE, PLUS THE AIRBAGS DID NOT COME OUT. I EXPECT SOMEONE TO CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY. *TR",
