OBSERVED SEVERE RUST-THROUGH OF FRAME ALONG FRAME WHERE SKID PLATE HAD BEEN BOLTED. ALSO TRANSMISSION SUPPORT FAILED. HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPLACED FAILED BRAKE LINES WHICH RUSTED THROUGH. I HAVE PARKED THE VEHICLE AS IT IS UNSAFE. I THINK I REALIZED IT TOO LATE, HOWEVER SOON ENOUGH TO HAVE PREVENTED A MAJOR ACCIDENT. WARNINGS NEED TO BE ISSUED IMMEDIATELY OF THESE AND OTHER DEFECTS WHICH HAVE BEEN NOTED BY JEEP OWNERS, ESPECIALLY FOR POTENTIAL BUYERS. THE FRAME APPARENTLY RUST FROM INSIDE OUT LEAVING LITTLE INDICATION OF SEVERITY.  *KB",
