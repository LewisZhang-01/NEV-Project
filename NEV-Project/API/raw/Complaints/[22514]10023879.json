AGAIN AT 20,000 IT DID THE SAME THING.  AFTER MUCH NEGOTIATING THEY FIXED IT AGAIN AND THIS TIME THEY REPLACED SOME KNOWN PROBLEM PARTS.  NOW AT 30,000 IT IS DOING THE SAME THING AND THEY ARE ADAMANT THAT THEY WILL NOT COVER THE WORK.  THEY HAVE GIVEN ME A # FOR THE HEAD TOYOTA OFFICE BUT I KNOW THIS WILL BE USELESS.  THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM A $40,000 VEHICLE.   *JB",
