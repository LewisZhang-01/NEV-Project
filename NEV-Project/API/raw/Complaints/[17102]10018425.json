IT IS NOISY, RUFF RUNNING, AND IT DOES NOT GET 21-27 MILES PER GALLON AS ADVERTISED!! 12 MILES PER GALLON IS MORE REALISTIC. BE WARNED! THIS VAN IS TERRIBLE. LOOK AT OTHER VANS DO NOT BUY OR LEASE THIS VEHICLE. THIS HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF CHRYSLER AND MAROONE DODGE AND THEY WILL DO NOTHING ABOUT IT. GO ELSEWHERE! THEY ARE NOT 5 STAR THEY SUCK!  *NLM",
