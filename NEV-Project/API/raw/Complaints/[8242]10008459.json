AND THEN I FOUND THAT IF I DON'T WARM THE CAR UP FOR ABOUT 1/2 HOUR TO 45 MINUTES IT WILL STOP AND WHILE WARMING THE CAR UP IT WILL STOP AT LEAST 3 TIMES IN THE PROCESS.  MY FRIEND ALSO HAS A 1999 CHRYSLER 300M AND HERS RECENTLY STARTED DOING THE SAME THING. I THINK THIS A VERY DANGEROUS THING THAT HAPPENS WHILE DRIVING. IT COULD POSSIBLY CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THESE PARTICULAR CARS AND CHRYSLER SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  *JB",
