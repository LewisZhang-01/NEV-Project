WHEN I WOKE UP THE CAR WAS UPSIDE DOWN AND I WAS LAYING ON THE ROOF ON MY STOMACH FACING FORWARD.  THE SEAT BELT CAME UNBUCKLED AND THE AIR BAG DID NOT DEPLOY.  IT APPEARS I WAS THROWN INTO THE EMPTY PASSENGER SEAT AS IT WAS BROKEN.  I AM UPSET THE BELT CAME UNBUCKLED.  THE CAR WAS A 1999 FORD CONTOUR SE.  I HAD NO BUCKLE PROBLEMS IN THE PAST.  *JB",
