THERE WAS A MAJOR DESIGN FLAW IN THOSE ENGINES AND FORD KNOWS IT. THEY DID AN EXTENDED 7 YEAR, 100,000 MILE WARANTEE ON IT AND BECAUSE OF MY LOW MILES (57,800) I DID NOT EXPERIENCE THE PROBLEM UNTIL NOW.  I AM 10 MONTHS PAST THE WARANTEE.  I FEEL THAT FORD SHOULD TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE ENGINES AND SHOULD HAVE RECALLED THEM ALL.  I HAVE GONE THROUGH MANY CHANNELS AND FORD WILL NOT HELP ME.  THE COST ESTIMATE FOR MY REPAIR WAS $4,500.00.  THIS IS NOW AN UNSAFE VEHICLE.",
