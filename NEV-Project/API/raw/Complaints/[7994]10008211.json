COULD NOT DRIVE DUE TO HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL AND CONCERN ABOUT CAUSING FURTHER DAMAGE.  SUBARU TOOK FOUR HOURS TO PICK UP CAR.  WHEN TAKEN TO DEALER FINALLY, WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS NOT A SUBARU PROBLEM AND THEY INDICATED I SHOULD BE CHARGED FOR A HALF HOUR LABOR AND WOULD NOT PAY FOR TOW. I WAS ALSO INFORMED THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE I WAS DRIVING ON DIRT ROADS (ISN'T THAT WHAT SUV'S ARE DESIGNED FOR?) I THINK THERE MUST BE A FLAW IN DESIGN OF FORESTER SUV.  SERVICE MANAGER INFORMED ME IT HAPPENS TO HIS WIFE FREQUENTLY, AND HE CORRECTS PROBLEM HIMSELF.  SEEMED TO BE SUGGESTING I  DO THE SAME WHICH SOUNDS UNREASONABLE FOR A CAR UNDER WARRANTY COVERAGE AND ONLY 11,000 MILES.  I RECEIVED VERY POOR SERVICE FROM SUBARU. HOW COULD I HAVE KNOWN BASED ON SYMPTOMS AND ADVISE OF DRIVER TO GO AHEAD WITH TOW THAT THIS WOULD NOT BE A SUBARU PROBLEM ,AND WHY DID THEY MAKE ME WAIT FOUR HOURS AND CHASE THEM BY TELEPHONE BEFORE THEY FINALLY PICKED UP CAR?*JB",
