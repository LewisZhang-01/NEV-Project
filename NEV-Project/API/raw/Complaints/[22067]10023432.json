WHEN THIS HAPPENS YOU HAVE NO POWER AND THIS COULD CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT OR DEATH BECAUSE OF THIS MAJOR FAILURE.  POLARIS IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM, HAS ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN, BUT DOES NOT CHECK THE MOTORCYCLES FOR THIS PROBLEM WHEN THE BIKE IS GETTING SERVICED.   I BELIEVE THERE IS APPROXIMATELY A 5% FAILURE RATE WHICH ON A MOTORCYCLE REDUCES YOUR ODDS SUBSTANTIALLY. THE NEW TRANSMISSION KITS HAVE CORRECTED THIS PROBLEM WITH FINER THREADS AND LOCKTITE TO HOLD THIS SPROCKET ON.  I BELIEVE THIS IS A SERIOUS FAILURE AND SHOULD BE CORRECTED BY POLARIS BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED ON THE ROAD WHEN THIS HAPPENS.   *NLM",
