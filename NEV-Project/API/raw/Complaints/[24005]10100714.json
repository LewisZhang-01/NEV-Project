        "summary": "1. DRIVING DURING A EARLY WINTER SNOW STORM IN NORTHERN IN. DRIVING AT CONSTANT SPEED ON INTERSTATE IN 4TH GEAR.  ALL OF A SUDDEN THE GLOW PLUG LIGHT CAME ON AND STARTED TO BLINK.  IT THEN BLINKED ON AND OFF FOR THE NEXT 2 HOURS TILL I ARRIVED AT MY DESTINATION  2. AFTER I GOT TO MY DESTINATION I LOOKED UP WHAT THE BLINKING GLOW PLUG LIGHT COULD MEAN ON THE INTERNET.  A VW CHAT PAGE SAID TO CHECK MY REAR TAIL LIGHTS.  I WENT OUT SIDE AND RESTARTED THE CAR, SAME LIGHT STARTED TO BLINK AND THE TAIL LIGHTS DID NOT WORK.  EMERGENCY FLASHERS WORKED AS WELL AS TURN SIGNALS BUT NO BRAKE LIGHTS.  WITH THE HEAVY SNOW FALL AND AT NIGHT  THIS COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A LARGE DISASTER IF A VEHICLE BEHIND ME HAD NOT SEEN THAT I WAS STOPPING.  3.  I TOOK THE CAR TO A VW DEALERSHIP TO BE FIXED AFTER I READ THAT THE BRAKE PEDAL SWITCH WAS UNDER RECALL FOR FAILURES.  THE DEALER INFORMED ME THAT MY MODEL VW WAS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE RECALL BUT THE BRAKE SENSOR WAS DEFECTIVE.  THEY REPLACED FOR $97.  NOW BRAKE LIGHTS WORK AGAIN.  IT SEEMS THAT MY AUTOMOBILE SHOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER THE RECALL SINCE I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM THAT OTHER VW JETTAS ARE GETTING FIXED FOR FREE UNDER A RECALL.*AK",
