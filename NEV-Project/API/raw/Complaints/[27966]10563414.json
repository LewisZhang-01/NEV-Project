I AM UNABLE TO SAFELY DRIVE THE VEHICLE, ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO READ SPEED, TEMPERATURE, FUEL LEVEL AND RPMS. HONDA WILL NOT HONOR REPAIRS UNDER WARRANTY AND THOUGH IT IS A COMMON KNOWN ISSUE, IT HAS NOT BEEN CLASSIFIED AS A SAFETY RECALL.    I FEEL THAT VEHICLES WITH THIS ISSUE ARE EXTREMELY UNSAFE AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE RECALLED.    THANK YOU.  *TR",
