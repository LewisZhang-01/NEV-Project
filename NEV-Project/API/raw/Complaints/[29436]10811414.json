ALSO SOMETIMES WHEN I TURN MY CAR ON AND TURN ON MY HEADLIGHTS, THEY WON'T TURN ON. BUT WHEN I PUT MY IN REVERSE AND DRIVE, THEY TURN ON. I GOT STOPPED FRIDAY NIGHT BECAUSE THE POLICE OFFICER SAID MY HEADLIGHTS WERE OUT AND WHEN I TESTED THEM OUT THEY WOULDN'T TURN ON WHILE I WAS SITTING STILL. I TOOK THEM TO GOODYEAR THE NEXT DAY AND TOLD WHAT WAS WRONG. THEY CHECKED THEM OUT AND SAID THAT NOTHING WAS WRONG AND EVERYTHING WAS WORKING RIGHT. HAZARDOUS NIGHT TIME DRIVING.",
