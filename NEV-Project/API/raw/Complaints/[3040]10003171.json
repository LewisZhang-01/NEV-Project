IT WHINES AND HAS A REAL LOUD WIND WHISTLE.  CAN YOU TELL ME IF YOU HAVE RECIEVED  ANY OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS YEAR AND MODEL VEHICLE?  I HAVE CONNECTED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED IT AND THEY SAID THAT IS NORMAL SOUNDS. I HAVE ALSO TAKEN IT TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP AND RECIEVED THE SAME RESPONSE. WE CAN'T BELIEVE THAT A COMPANY WOULD MAKE A CAR THAT HAS A BAD WIND NOISE COMING FROM THE TRANMISSION.IT HAS STARTED SLIPPING ON OCCASIONS AND WHEN WE COME TO A STOP IT SHIFTS HARD AND AGAIN THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT IS NORMAL.",
