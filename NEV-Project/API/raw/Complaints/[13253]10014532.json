ALL THREE (AS TOLD BY GOODYEAR) WERE CAUSED BY BENT RIMS.  TWO OF THE BENDS WERE VERY NOTICEABLE AND EACH OCCURRED WITH REGULAR DRIVING.  I FEEL LIKE I AM DRIVING ON A TIME BOMB. EVEN WITH MINOR BENDS, AIR RELEASES FROM THE TIRE.  I CHECK MY PRESSURE EVERY WEEK, BUT STILL TO NO AVAIL.  FROM OTHER COMPLAINTS I HAVE READ, THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM THAT MITSUBISHI APPEARS TO BE IGNORING.  *JB",
