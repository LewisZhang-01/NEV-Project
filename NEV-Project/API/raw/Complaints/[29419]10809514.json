WE WERE FORTUNATE IT HAPPENED IN OUR OWN ALLEY.  I'D STOPPED THE CAR TO UNLOAD GROCERIES AND WHEN I TRIED TO START IT AGAIN, IT ONLY LET ME OPEN AND LOCK THE DOORS. OTHERWISE, IT WAS FROZEN AND BLOCKING THE ALLEY TO ALL OUR NEIGHBORS.  WE'D BEEN ON A TRIP IN JANUARY 2015 THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS IF IT HAPPENED THEN.  (LESS THAN 36 HOURS AFTER THE LONG ROAD TRIP MY HUSBAND HAD A HEART ATTACK.  IF THIS FAILURE HAPPENED DURING THAT DRIVE, HE WOULDN'T BE ALIVE TODAY.)  WE HAD NO IDEA THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH OUR 2009 NISSAN UNTIL IT HAPPENED.  THIS CAR (AND TWO OTHER NISSAN VEHICLES) HAD BEEN TOTALLY RELIABLE.  NISSAN RESPONDED SAYING OUR WARRANTY EXPIRED IN FEB 2015 AND DIDN'T COVER THE ALMOST $1200 COST IN ANY WAY.  WE FEEL ROBBED AND ABANDONED BY NISSAN.  ONCE WE RESEARCHED THIS, WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THIS ISSUE HAS HAPPENED TO SO MANY 2009-10 OWNERS.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD BE A RECALL!  WE WERE LOOKING AT ANOTHER NISSAN AND ARE DOING BETTER RESEARCH INTO COMPETITORS BEFORE WE TAKE THAT STEP.",
