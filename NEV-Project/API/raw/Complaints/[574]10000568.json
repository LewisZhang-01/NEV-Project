AT THE DEALER SUGGESTED AND PUSHED THE GAS TO THE FLOOR AND TRIED AGAIN WITH NO LUCK.  I WAS TOLD BEFORE THAT THIS COULD BE A PROBLEM WITH THE AIR BEING COLD.  WHY WOULD THEY SELL A CAR WHERE IT SNOWS IF IT WON'T START.  MY WIFE IS EXPECTING A BABY IN 8 WEEKS AND WE NEED A RELIABLE CAR.  THE DEALER DOES NOT SEEM ANXIOUS TO HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  TODAY IS JAN. 6, 2003 AND I CANNOT REGISTER BELOW AS 2003 BECAUSE IT IS NOT OFFERED ON THE DROP DOWN BOX.  THEREFORE I AM REGISTERING AS 2002.",
