WE TOOK OUR VAN INTO THE FORD DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE AND WERE TOLD THAT THE TIE ROD ENDS WERE SHOT. THE REPAIRMAN (AT FORD) TOLD US THAT WE ARE LUCKY WE GOT IT IN FOR SERVICE WHEN WE DID. APPARENTLY THE TIE RODS COULD HAVE BROKEN AT ANY TIME WHILE DRIVING!     THE VAN IS WELL TAKEN CARE OF AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE TIE RODS WOULD BE IN SUCH BAD SHAPE. THIS SEEMS LIKE A MANUFACTURER CONCERN AND CERTAINLY A SAFETY CONCERN FOR ALL OF THOSE WHO TRANSPORT THEIR FAMILIES IN A WINDSTAR!    I'D LIKE TO SEE FORD COVER THE COST OF THIS REPAIR AND TELL ME WHY MY FAMILIES' SAFETY WAS PUT INTO JEOPARDY WHILE DRIVING SUCH A NEW VEHICLE.",
