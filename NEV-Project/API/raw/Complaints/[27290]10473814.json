THE VAN WAS TOWED TO TOMBALL DODGE. THE FIRE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE STARTED IN THE LEFT SIDE HEAD LIGHT, CAUSING SEVERE DAMAGE TO THE WIRING, HOOD, FENDER, BUMPER, MIRROR, INSULATION AND MUCH MORE. DODGE HAS NOT TAKEN ANY RESPONSIBILITY AND AFTER 4 MONTHS BEING REPAIRED AND AT A COST OF $12,763.50. I HAVE FOUR OTHER SPRINTERS IN MY FLEET, AND I AM VERY CONCERNED. I THINK WITH THE NUMEROUS ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS THAT SPRINTERS HAVE HAD, THIS WAS ONE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE TAKEN CARE OF.  *TR",
