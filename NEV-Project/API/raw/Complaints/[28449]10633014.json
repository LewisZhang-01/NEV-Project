WHEN I LOOKED UNDERNEATH THE TRUCK I COULD SEE THAT THE BRAKE LINES ARE VERY CORRODED AND ONE IS LEAKING.  IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WILL ALL NEED TO BE REPLACED AND THE TRUCK WILL PROBABLY NEED TO BE TOWED IN TO HAVE THIS DONE.  IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS WILL BE A VERY COSTLY FIX.  I BOUGHT THIS TRUCK NEW AND IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN GARAGED AND WELL TAKEN CARE OF.  *TR",
