        "summary": "WHEN I START MY VEHICLE, GAS GAUGE RISES TO ACTUAL GAS LEVEL.  AFTER 3-4 MINUTES OF DRIVING, GAS GAUGE DROPS TO EMPTY, AND REMAINS UNTIL TRUCK IS RESTARTED.  SOMETIMES THE GAUGE WILL RISE TO ONE-HALF TANK, AND STAY AS WELL.  ON ONE OCCASION, I WAS STRANDED ON THE INTERSTATE WITH MY 4 YEAR OLD SON AND MY WIFE. THE GAUGE WAS STUCK A  HALF TANK, BUT I WAS ACTUALLY OUT OF GAS.  4 HOURS LATER I WAS BACK HOME.  ON SOME LEVEL I THINK THAT CONSTITUTES A SAFETY HAZARD.  I CALLED MY LOCAL GM DEALERSHIP AND SAID IT WAS MOST LIKELY A FUEL-SENDING UNIT INSIDE THE TANK, AND IT WAS NOT COVERED BY MY POWER-TRAIN WARRANTY.  WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE BETWEEN $600-$900 TO REPLACE. RIDICULOUS!!!  I HAVE READ HUNDREDS OF SIMILAR ISSUES TO THE SAME MAKE AND MODEL OF MY TRAIL BLAZER.  IT IS TIME FOR GM TO ALLOW THESE TO BE REPLACED UNDER THE 100,000 MILE POWER TRAIN WARRANTY.  THIS MAY NOT QUALIFY AS A SAFETY RECALL, BUT SURELY A DEFECT THAT GM NEEDS TO ADDRESS!!! *TR",
