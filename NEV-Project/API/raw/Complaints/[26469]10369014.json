ALSO, THE HEAD GASKET IS BLOWN I WAS TOLD BY A GARAGE THAT IT WAS THE TYPE OF COOLANT THEY USED AND ALSO VERY COMMON ON THESE CARS. THESE ARE CLEARLY DEFECTS IN THEIR PRODUCT AND THEY SHOULD BE RECALLED. I HAVE BOUGHT AMERICAN CARS ALL MY LIFE BUT I,M DONE      WITH THEM ,THEY DON'T STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT. *TR",
