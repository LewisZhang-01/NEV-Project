        "summary": "THE BMW E46 (3 SERIES BMW) THAT WAS MADE FROM 1999 TO 2006.  IN SOME CASES DURING THESE YEARS THEY USED A LIGHTING MANUFACTURER \"ZKW\" FOR THEIR XENON HEADLIGHTS.  UNFORTUNATELY THESE LIGHTS HAVE A COMMON FAILURE ISSUE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A \"BURNT REFLECTOR\" ON THE INTERNET AND ON BMW FORUMS. THIS IS A NON-CONSUMER REPLACEABLE PART.  WHEN THIS PART FAILS IT CAUSES THE VEHICLE TO NOT HAVE EFFECTIVE HEADLIGHTS.  I PERSONALLY HAVE HAD TIMES WHERE MY FIELD OF VISION COULD NOT SEE ITEMS ON THE ROAD DUE TO THE DIM LIGHTS.  THE ONLY REMEDY APPEARS TO BE TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY TO THE TUNE OF HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS (WELL OVER A THOUSAND IF YOU DO BOTH SIDES).  IN MY OPINION BMW SHOULD CORRECT THIS ISSUE FOR THE CONSUMER.  HEADLIGHTS ARE AN IMPORTANT SAFETY ITEM.  TO HAVE A PART FAIL THAT IS NOT CONSUMER REPLACEABLE IS UNACCEPTABLE.    MANY PEOPLE HAVE THIS ISSUE BUT HAVE NO WAY TO REMEDY IT.  JUST GOOGLE IT OR CHECK E46FANATICS.COM.  YOU WILL SEE THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE THAT REALIZE THIS IS AN ISSUE.  *TR",
