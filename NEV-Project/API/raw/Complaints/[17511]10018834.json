THE ONCOMING VEHICLE SWERVED AND AVOIDED A HEAD ON COLLISION WITH ME.  ABOUT 20 SECONDS LATER DOWN THE ROAD THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES LOCKED AGAIN AS I TURNED INTO MY DEVELOPMENT AND AGAIN I SLID.  VEHICLE HAS BEEN SERVICED THROUGH ITS LIFE AND HAS A LITTLE OVER 52,000 MILES ON IT.  I COULD BE DEAD RIGHT NOW HAD I NOT BEEN A SLOWER HIGHWAY.  IT APPEARS THIS PROBLEM HAS EXISTED SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS PRODUCED AFTER READING ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS ON THIS SITE.  *JB",
