I HAD BEEN HEARING A KNOCKING  FROM THE FRONT OF THE CAR AND THE STEERING WAS LOOSE.  WHEN I TYRNED THE WHEEL LEFT OR RIGHT IT WOULD STICK AND I HAD LOUD POPPING FROM THE STEERING.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND IT WAS THE RACK AND PINION.  THAT WAS ON JANUARY 21, 2003.  IN THE SAME WEEK I NOTICED OIL LEAKING.  THE OIL LIGHT WAS BLINKING ON AND OFF.  THE DEALER SAID IT WAS LEAKING DUE TO THE OIL SWITCH.  TO FIX THE RACK AND OIL LEAK IT COST ME ANOTHER $1300.00.  I AM TRYING TO GET THE DODGE COMPANY TO FESS UP AND PAY FOR THE REPAIRS.  THE CAR HAS BEEN WELL MAINTANENCED AND ONLY 51,000 MILES.",
