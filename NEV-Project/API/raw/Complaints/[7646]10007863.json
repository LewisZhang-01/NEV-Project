AFTER DOING RESEARCH, I'VE FOUND OUT THAT THIS IS A COMMOM PROBLEM W/ THE GM VEHICLES AND THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD TO SPEND HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN REPAIRS TO HAVE THIS FIXED. IT CONVENIENTLY HAPPENS JUST AFTER THE WARRENTY PERIOD HAS EXPIRED. THIS IS CLEARLY UNFAIR TO THE CONSUMER AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY GM HAS NOT BEEN FORCED TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM.",
