ABOUT 7 MILES INTO MY 9 MILE DRIVE TO WORK MY CAR ACTED LIKE A BIG GUST OF WIND HAD JUST HIT THE FRONT.  I PULLED OVER TO CHECK OUT THE CAR.  I DISCOUVERED THAT THE 2 LEFT TIRES WERE LOW.  BY THE TIME I GOT TO WORK THE FRONT HAD GONE FLAT.  WHEN I CHANGE IT WITH THE SPARE I DISCOVERED THAT THE TREAD HAD SEPARATED FROM THE TIRE AT THE INNER SIDE WALL.  I THEN CRAWLED UNDER MY CAR TO EXAMINE THE OTHER LOW TIRE TO FIND IT HAD SEPARATED ALSO.  WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE TIRE STORE TO HAVE ALL 4 REPLACE ATLEAST ONE OF THE OTHER 2 WAS ALSO SHOWING SIGNS OF SEPARATION. I RETAINED THE TIRES FROM THE DEALER AND HAVE THEM AT MEY HOME IN AURORA.",
