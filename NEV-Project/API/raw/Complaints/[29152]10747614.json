THE CAR HYDROPLANED HITTING THE JERSEY BARRIER, SPINNING TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET HITTING THE GUARDRAIL, AND FURTHER SPINNING TO HIT THE JERSEY BARRIER AGAIN TOTALING THE CAR.      THIS IS NOT A COMPLAINT AS MUCH AS IT IS INFO FOR TAKING US OFF YOUR RECALL LIST.  WE NO LONGER OWN THE VIBE.  I DO WANT TO SAY, HOWEVER, HAD MY DAUGHTER NOT BEEN IN SUCH A WELL-BUILT VEHICLE, SHE WOULD PROBABLY NOT HAVE SURVIVED WITH JUST BRUISES WHERE THE SEATBELT HELD HER IN PLACE AND BRUISING TO HER RIGHT KNEE BECAUSE HER KNEE HIT THE  DASHBOARD AREA.  THE DRIVERS SIDE AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY, WHICH WE QUESTIONED WHY DUE TO THE SEVERITY OF THE ACCIDENT.  THAT BEING SAID, SHE WAS RATHER HAPPY IT DID NOT DEPLOY BECAUSE SHE FELT SHE WOULD HAVE HAD MORE PHYSICAL ISSUES HAD IT DEPLOYED (BURNS).  --- THANK YOU.  *TR",
