        "summary": "EXHAUST MANIFOLD BOLTS BREAKING OFF LEAVING STUDS IN THE HEADS (4)  MY LATE 2002 CHEVY Z71 DEVELOPED AN EXHAUST LEAK AND THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER STARTED BANGING AT IDLE OR AFTER PARKED. ENGINE HAS BLACK EXHAUST ON THE HEAD  WHERE WE FOUND THE MAIN LEAK. SO, CARBON MONOXIDE HAS BEEN COMING INTO THE CAB  AND THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT SEEMS HOTTER THAN NORMAL. WHEN CHECKING INTO THE ISSUE, I FOUND EVERY TRUCK IN OUR COMPANY FLEET HAS THIS SAME ISSUE AND OUR ASSOCIATES THAT HAVE PERSONAL TRUCKS DRIVING TO WORK CHECKED THEIRS AND THEY ALSO HAVE THE SAME ISSUE. FROM 1999 THRU 2008 YEARS. WHEN CONTACTING OUR LOCAL CHEVY DEALER, THEY ADVISED THEY HAD NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF ANY ISSUES LIKE THIS.  I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE. EVERY PERSON I MENTION THIS TO, CHECKS THEIR TRUCK AND HAS THE SAME ISSUES WITH THE BROKEN BOLTS. THERE IS DEFINITELY A PROBLEM WITH THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD CONTRACTING AND EXPANDING TOO MUCH- CHEAP STEEL ATTACHED TO ALUMINUM HEADS APPEAR ON ALL OF THE V-8 TRUCK ENGINES. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AS A SAFETY ISSUE WITH HEAT AND CARBON MONOXIDE AS WELL AS THE COSTS TO REPAIR.  *TR",
