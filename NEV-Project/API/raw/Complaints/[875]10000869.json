        "summary": "I OWN A 2001 FORD FOCUS ZX3. I HAVE PUT 17,100 MILES ON IT SINCE ITS PURCHASE IN MAY, 2001. AT THE LAST SERVICE, JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS OF 2002, THE FORD MECHANIC AT PRICE FORD IN MILLINGTON, TN. STATED THAT MY FRONT BRAKES & ROTORS WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED SOON.     THERE IS NO WAY ON EARTH THIS AMOUNT OF WEAR AND TEAR CAN OCCUR ON A CAR WITH ONLY 17,100 MILES! I HAVE OWNED 9 AUTOMOBILES IN MY LIFE AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF BRAKES WEARING OUT IN UNDER 20,000 MILES! THIS MUST BE A DEFECT, OR ENGINEERING MISTAKE WITH FORD'S BRAKES!    I INITIALLY THOUGHT THE MECHANIC WAS HIGH OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY THE BRAKES CAN BE WORN OUT, BUT I HAVE NEARLY WRECKED 3 TIMES SINCE THEN DUE SPECIFICALLY TO THE BRAKES HAVING NO AFFECT ON THE SPEED OF THE CAR. I'M LOOKING AT A MINIMUM OF $400 TO GET NEW ROTORS AND PADS AND LABOR TO INSTALL THE NEW PARTS. THIS IS CRAZY!    YOU NEED TO INVESTIGATE THIS TO SEE WHY ME AND MANY OTHERS ARE EXPERIENCING THESE ISSUES!",
