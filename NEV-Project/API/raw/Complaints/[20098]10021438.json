DID NOT USE CAR UNTIL TRANSPORT TO DEALERSHIP IN PORT JEFERSON, NY ON JUNE 11, 2003. I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE FUEL PUMP. LOOKING THROUGH PAST COMPLAINTS IT APPEARS THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH THIS MAKE, MODEL AND YEAR. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE MANUFACTURER INTENDS TO DO ABOUT THIS. I HOPE THAT THIS WILL NOT BE ANOTHER FORD PINTO SITUATION. *JB",
