WATER SPRAYED UP ON THE SERPENTINE BELT WHICH THREW THE BELT OFF OF THE IDLER PULLEY AND TENSIONER PULLEY.  BOTH TIMES WE WERE MAKING A RIGHT HAND TURN... WHICH MADE IT VERY DANGEROUS BECAUSE WE LOSS THE POWER STEERING.  THE FIRST TIME WAS WITH MY WIFE DRIVING...WHICH WOULD BE VERY HARD TO CONTROL FOR A LADY... THE SECOND TIME I WAS DRIVING, WHICH WAS BETTER... BUT STILL VERY DANGEROUS.  I AM PLANNING ON PURCHASING THE GOODYEAR REPLACEMENT KIT THAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED ON SEVERAL WEBSITES AND THIS WEBSITE.  DAIMLERCHRYSLER SHOULD BE RECALLING ALL THESE VANS AND REPLACING ALL THE PULLEYS WITH THESE SAFER KITS.  *TR",
