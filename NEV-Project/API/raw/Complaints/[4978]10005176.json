WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY, DUE TO LOSS OF ALL POWER, I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE CAR BEFORE IT ENTERED THE INTERSECTION ON A RED LIGHT.  I PUT IT IN PARK AND IT DID START UP AGAIN.    I CALLED THE WESTLAND FORD SERVICE DEPT.  THEY SAID THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THAT HAPPENING.  I ASKED IF THEY COULD PUT IT THROUGH A DIAGNOSTICS CHECK AND FIND OUT WHAT'S WRONG.  THEY SAID UNLESS IT'S HAPPENING WHEN THE CAR IS THERE THEY PROBABLY WOULDN'T FIND ANYTHING.   I CALLED THE FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY ALSO SAID THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THAT HAPPENING.  THEY AGREED THAT IT WOULD BE HARD TO DIAGNOSE THE CAUSE.  THEY SAID THEY WOULD SUBMIT MY COMPLAINT TO ENGINEERING...  SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR USED, IT'S NOT UNDER WARRANTY.  I FEEL THAT THEY SOLD THIS CAR TO ME KNOWING THAT IT HAD A PROBLEM.  DO I HAVE ANY RECOURSE?  HELP!",
