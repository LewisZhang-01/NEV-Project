WHEN THE TRUCK IS RUNNING ON THE REAR TANK, AND THE FRONT TANK IS FULL, THE REAR TANK PUMPS FUEL INTO THE ALREADY FULL FRONT TANK, CAUSING IT TO OVERFLOW OUT OF THE FUEL CAP AND SPILL DOWN THE SIDE OF THE TRUCK ONTO TO THE GROUND. THE FORD DEALER SAID THAT THE 1989 TO 1993 MODELS WERE COVERED BY A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM, BUT NOT THE 1995 MODELS. I CALLED FORD BUT THEY WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING. I BELIEVE THAT A RECALL SHOULD BE ORDERED ON THIS PROBLEM THIS COULD BE A REAL FIRE HAZARD.  *NLM",
