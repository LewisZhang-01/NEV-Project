        "summary": "I HAVE HAD TWO INCIDENTS WITH LOSS OF SPEED CONTROL WITHIN THE PAST WEEK ON A SUBARU I JUST BOUGHT. THE FIRST I WAS ACCELERATING FROM A STOPLIGHT WHEN I LOST RESPONSE FROM THE GAS PEDAL AND THE ENGINE WENT TO A LOW RPM WHICH ALLOWED ME TO JUST BARELY ROLL INTO A NEARBY PARKING LOT. WHEN THROTTLE CONTROL WAS LOST THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. AFTER TURNING THE CAR OFF AND LETTING IT SIT A MOMENT I TRIED TO TURN IT ON AGAIN, BUT IT WOULDN'T START. I TRIED A SECOND TIME AND IT STARTED, BUT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT REMAINED ON. THE NEXT TIME I STARTED THE CAR THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT HAD GONE OFF.    THE SECOND TIME WAS NEARLY IDENTICAL BUT DRIVING UP A STEEP HILL ON A HIGHWAY AROUND 65 MPH. AGAIN THROTTLE CONTROL WAS LOST AND ENGINE WENT TO LOW RPM SO I COULD BARELY PROGRESS UP THE HILL AT 20-30MPH TO FIND A PLACE TO PULL OFF, CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WENT ON IMMEDIATELY. BEFORE I TURNED THE CAR OFF THE ENGINE WAS IDLING ROUGH, ABOUT 2000 RPM. AGAIN IT TOOK TWO TRIES TO START BUT THEN I WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STILL ON. AFTER DRIVING IT TWO OR THREE TIMES THE NEXT DAY THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT HAD GONE OFF.     IN EITHER SITUATION I COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT IF I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO PULL OFF QUICKLY, ESPECIALLY IN A HIGH SPEED AREA AS THE VEHICLE COULD ONLY MAINTAIN A LOW SPEED DUE TO THE LOW ENGINE RPM (2K-3K). THERE IS NO WARNING BEFORE IT OCCURS. I BELIEVE THERE IS A FAULT IN THE THROTTLE BY WIRE SYSTEM.",
