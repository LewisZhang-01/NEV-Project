THE CAMSHAFTS (PER DEALER) ARE FAILING AND I FEAR THAT THEY WILL CAUSE DAMAGE TO MY PASSENGERS OR MYSELF.  THE DETROIT FREE PRESS HAS PUBLISHED A SERIES OF ARTICLES ON THE FAILURE OF CAMSHAFTS IN TAURUS SHO ENGINES SINCE 1996.    THE MANUFACTURER OF THE VEHICLE REFUSES TO ADMIT THEY HAVE A RECALL ISSUE EVEN THOUGH THEY BEGAN REPLACING CAMSHAFTS ON VEHICLES WITH AS LITTLE AS 30,000 MILES FOR THE FAILURE OF THE WELDS THAT ATTACH THE CAMSHAFT SPROCKETS TO THE CAMSHAFTS.  AFTER SPENDING NEARLY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON REPAIRS TO THE VEHICLE IT CAME BACK WITH A NOISE WHICH THE DEALER HAS IDENTIFIED AS CAMSHAFT FAILURE.  THE COSTS OF REPAIR WERE ESTIMATED AT BETWEEN TWO AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS.  THE MANUFACTURER HAS NO PLANS FOR A RECALL AND THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS NOT RETURNING MY CALLS.  WHAT COURSE OF ACTION CAN I PURSUE IN THIS MATTER? *JB",
