I HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE GAGE/SENDING UNIT FOR THE LAST (ALMOST) THREE YEARS.  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY MY JEEP IS NOT COVERED WHEN SO MANY MORE ARE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  MY GAGE SOMETIMES DOES NOT SHOW EMPTY WHEN IT IS AND SOMETIMES SHOWES EMPTY 100 MILES INTO THE FULL TANK.  I HAVE TALKED TO SEVAL OTHER JEEP OWNERS AND SOME OF THEM HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM.  YET, THE DEALERSHIPS SAY EVEN THOUGH SOME JEEPS ARE COVERED UNDER THE RECALL OTHERS ARE NOT.  CRAZY!",
