DURING A 75,000 MILE SERVICE, THE DEALER DISCOVERED THAT THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT WIRING HARNESS WAS DECOMPOSING AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  SHORTLY AFTERWARD THE \"CHECK ENGINE \" TROUBLE LIGHT BEGAN TO COME ON REPEATEDLY.  THE ENTIRE ENGINE WIRING HARNESS HAD TO BE REPLACED.  THE DEALERS SERVICE TECHNICIAN MADE A COMMENT ON MY  PAPERWORK THAT THE HARNESS HAD FRAYED THROUGH IN ONE AREA AND WAS SHORTING OUT IN A VALVE COVER.  THIS TYPE OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCT CONSTITUTES A CLASS 1 SAFETY ISSUE.   VIA THE INTERNET, I DISCOVERED THAT MANY OTHER OWNERS OF THIS TYPE CAR FROM 1994 TO 1996 HAVE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR DECOMPOSING WIRING HARNESSES.  THIS SITUATION SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY A GENERAL RECALL AND MERCEDES BENZ OF NORTH AMERICA SHOULD REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE WIRING HARNESSES.",
