        "summary": "I HAVE HAD THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS  WHERE WHEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE AND ATTEMPTING TO TURN INTO A CORNER THE CAR COMPLETELY SHUTS OFF AND LOSES ALL POWER AND ABILITY TO STEER. THE FIRST TWO OCCASIONS OCCURRED WHERE I COULD SIMPLY PLACE THE CAR IN PARK AND RESTART AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED. THE LAST OCCURRENCE 2/9/17 HAPPENED AS DESCRIBED ABOVE WAS TURNING INTO AN ALLEY GOING LESS THAN 20MPH WHEN CAR JUST SHUT OFF. I PLACED THE CAR IN PARK AND WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO RESTART, THE CAR TURNED ON BUT WHEN PUSHING THE GAS THE CAR WOULD BARELY ACCELERATE.  I HAD THE CAR TOWED AND THE WRECKER  TRIED TO DRIVE THE CAR ONTO THE TOW TRUCK BUT WAS UNABLE TO GET IT UP THE BED AS IT DIDNT HAVE ANY POWER TO DRIVE UP THE BED. I TOOK IT TO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP WHO RAN DIAGNOSTICS AND STATED THAT THERE WERE NO CODES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED. THEY STATED IT WAS RUNNING JUST FINE, AND COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE SAME ISSUE. THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY HAZZARD AS THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO NOTICE WHEN THE CAR WILL SHUT OFF AND LOSE POWER STEERING. THIS COULD EASILY BE A HUGE ACCIDENT IF OCCURS ON THE FREEWAY. I WOULD LIKE ANSWERS AS TO WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE CAR. I HAVE SEEN HUNDREDS OF OTHER NISSAN OWNERS WITH SIMILAR PROBLEMS (ALL REPORTING THAT NO DIAGNOSTIC CODES PROMPTED DURING DIAGNOSING).",
