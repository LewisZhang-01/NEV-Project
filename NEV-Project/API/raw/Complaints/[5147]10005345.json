        "summary": "THE TIMING CHAIN WAS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY ONCE AND I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE TWO ALTERNATORS DUE TO THIS. NOW, MY TIMING CHAIN IS GOING OUT AGAIN. THE CAR IS A 1995 SATURN SC2. TODAY IT ONLY HAS 66,000 MILES ON IT AND IS EIGHT YEARS OLD. I CHANGE THE OIL EVERY 3,000 MILES. BUT, I ALSO HAVE TO PUT OIL IN IT IN BETWEEN CHANGES. NOW, MY MOON ROOF WON'T CLOSE ALL THE WAY. IT WILL OPEN ALL THE WAY BUT IT WON;T CLOSE. ALSO, THE HEADLIGHT ON THE PASSENGERS SIDE WON'T GO UP AND DOWN PROPERLY.I HAD MY FRONT SEAT FIXED BECAUSE IT WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN WHEN A LITTLE PRESSURE WAS APPLIED WHEN DRIVING. I ALMOST HAD AN ACCIDENT DUE TO THIS AND IT SCARED ME  SO I TOOK IT IN TO THE SATURN DEALER TO HAVE IT FIXED. I TRIED TO ARGUE WITH THEM ABOUT IT NOT BEING MY FAULT THAT THAT HAPPENED. BUT THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN. NOW, 4 YEARS LATER IT IS RECALLED. IF I KNEW WHO TO COMPLAIN TO BEFORE I WOULD HAVE ADDED MY TWO CENTS IN. I DO HAVE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE SEATS RECLINING DEVICES TO BE REPAIRED. THANKS FOR LISTENING.      KATHY HOLLEY",
