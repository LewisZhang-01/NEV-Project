        "summary": "MY WIFE HAD BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT A STRONG ODOR OF FUEL THAT SHE COULD SMELL WHILE BOTH IN HER VEHICLE DRIVING, AS WELL AS, WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED AND SHE WAS OUTSIDE OF IT. I INVESTIGATED AND DETECTED A STRONG ODOR OF FUEL AS WELL. WE THEN HAD OUR MECHANIC INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM FURTHER AND HE DISCOVERED THAT THE TOP OF THE FUEL TANK WAS SEVERELY CORRODED, AS WELL AS, IN THE AREA OF THE TANK'S SEAM. THE MORE FUEL IN THE TANK, THE WORSE THE RELEASE OF FUEL VAPORS BECOMES, AS THE TANK ITSELF BECOMES SATURATED DUE TO THE SEVERE CORROSION. MY MECHANIC TRIED TO LOCATE A NEW FUEL TANK THROUGH A LOCAL DEALERSHIP BUT SOON DISCOVERED THAT THE FUEL TANK FOR THIS VEHICLE IS NOT AVAILABLE. THERE ARE NO AFTER MARKET, NEW OR SALVAGE TANKS AVAILABLE FOR THE 1997 LUMINA - NATIONWIDE. I FILED A REPORT WITH GENERAL MOTORS 1(800) NUMBER ON DECEMBER 23RD, 2002. THE DEALERSHIP ALSO OPENED A SPAC CASE THROUGH THEIR PARTS NETWORK. I HAVE FOLLOWED UP WITH GM'S 1 (800) NUMBER TWICE SINCE. THERE ARE NO FUEL TANKS AVAILABLE FOR THIS VEHICLE. I AM BEING TOLD THAT THERE MAY BE A TANK AVAILABLE IN LATE FEBRUARY OR MARCH BUT NO ONE CAN GIVE ME A DATE. ALL I'M BEING TOLD IS THAT EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE IS BEING DONE. MY LOG NUMBER WITH GM'S 1 (800) NUMBER IS 1-57851557. I HAVE NOW BEEN WITHOUT A VEHICLE (DUE TO SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS) FOR OVER FIVE WEEKS.  RESEARCHING EXISTING COMPLAINTS, THE FOLLOWING EXHIBIT THE SAME OR SIMILAR PROBLEM OR COULD BE SOMEHOW RELATED: 567617, 725489, 769287, 785477, 816599, 8013382, 8020645. TODAY, WITH NO FUEL TANKS AVAILABLE, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW MANY PROBLEMS HAVE GONE UNREPORTED.",
