        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING ALONG THE HIGHWAY AT ABOUT 50MPH, AND WHILE TOWING A TRAILER, THE FRONT DRIVER-SIDE GOODYEAR WRANGLER AT TIRE BLEW OUT.  IN DOING SO, IT ALSO BLEW OUT THE HOUSING, THE FRONT BUMPER, THE FRONT LIGHTS AND ASSORTED OTHER ITEMS.  THE BLOW OUT FORCED US FROM THE SLOW LANE OVER 3 LANES TO THE MEDIAN DIVIDER.  THANK GOD THAT THERE WERE NO OTHER CARS ON THE ROAD B/C DEATH AND DISASTER WOULD HAVE ENSUED.  WE WERE ABLE TO STOP THE VEHICLE WITHOUT LOSING THE TRAILER.  THE RADIALS WERE INFLATED PER MANUFACTURER SPECS, HAD BEEN ROTATED PER SPECS, AND HAD ABOUT 30,000 MILES ON THEM.  THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED ABOUT 2:30PM ALASKA TIME; THE TEMPERATURE WAS ABOUT 40 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.  THE VEHICLE IS NOT DRIVEABLE - IT WAS TOWED TO THE LOCAL DODGE BODY SHOP.  ESTIMATES TO REPAIR ARE SUBSTANTIAL!!!",
