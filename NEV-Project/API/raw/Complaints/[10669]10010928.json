BUT I PAID THE FORD DEALER SHIP $60.00 TO TELL ME WHY MY POWER WINDOW WOULD ONLY WORK PART OF THE TIME, AND THEY SAID IT WAS MY MOTOR WHICH THEY WANTED $353.00 FOR. SO I TOLD THEM  I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS SO I WENT HOME AND WORKED ON IT MYSELF AND FOUND OUT IT WAS ONLY STICKING AT THE TOP. I WENT BACK ON THE 24TH OF MARCH TO TRY TO GET MY MONEY BACK, BECAUSE TO ME THIS IS COMPLETE FRAUD ON THEIR PART. WELL, I TALKED WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER (MARK KISCH) AND HE WAS VERY RUDE, AND REFUSED TO RETURN MY MONEY.  HE EVEN LAUGHED WHEN I TOLD HIM I WAS GOING TO REPORT HIM. IT IS NOT MY PROBLEM THAT HE HAS  BAD PEOPLE WORKING THERE THAT DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR DOING. *JB",
