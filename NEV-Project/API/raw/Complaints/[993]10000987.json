ALSO, DRIVERS WHO DRIVE WITH THEIR DRIVING LIGHTS ON WHEN NOT NEEDED REALLY CAUSE PROBLEMS.  CAN'T IT BE REGULATED THAT DRIVING LIGHTS AUTOMATICALLY SHUT OFF WHEN APPROACHING ANOTHER VEHICLE.  HEADLIGHTS NOWDAYS ARE JUST TOO BRIGHT.  I HAVE ALMOST BEEN IN SEVERAL ACCIDENTS DUE TO BEING BLINDED BY THE BRIGHT HEADLIGHTS.",
