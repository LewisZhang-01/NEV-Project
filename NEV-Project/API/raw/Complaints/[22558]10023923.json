I INFORMED THE SERVICE DEPT OF THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE AND WAS TOLD THIS IS NORMAL.  ABOUT A MONTH LATER I BEGAN HEARING A SQUEALING SOUND WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKES, I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN AND I WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS NORMAL.  THE DEALER EVEN BEGAN TO READ ME AN ARTICLE/PUBLICATION SUGGESTING THAT THIS WAS BECAUSE THESE WERE HIGH PERFORMANCE BRAKES.  NEEDLESS TO SAY AFTER BACK AND FORTH WITH THIS DEALER AND INFINITI FOR OVER 4 MONTHS, TO NO AVAIL I LEFT THE ISSUE ALONE.  NOW 6 MONTHS LATER, I REQUIRE NEW FRONT BRAKES AT ONLY 19,000 MILES.   *NLM",
