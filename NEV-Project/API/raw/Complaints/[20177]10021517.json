        "summary": "MY SEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS EXITING OUR 2002 DODGE GRAND CARAVAN WHEN HER FOOT SLIPPED THROUGH THE SAFETY BELT STRAP.  THE STRAP WAS LOCATED NEXT TO THE SLIDING DOOR OF THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR.  THE STRAP WAS IN IT'S STORAGE POSITION, BUT WAS CLEARLY STILL IN THE WAY OF HER STEPPING PAST THE MIDDLE PASSENGER SEAT AS SHE EXITED FROM THE REAR SEAT OF THE VEHICLE.  SINCE THE STRAP \"LOOPED\" AROUND HER FOOT, SHE THEN TRIPPED AND TUMBLED OUT OF THE SLIDING DOOR SIDE OF THE VEHICLE.  I WITNESSED EVERYTHING--ANY TALLER: SHE WOULD HAVE STRUCK HER HEAD ON THE DOOR OF THE CAR.  SHE ACTUALLY FELL OUT THE SLIDING DOOR AREA AND SCRAPED HER ARMS PRETTY GOOD.  I WAS SURE SHE MUST HAVE BROKE BOTH ARMS THE WAY THAT SHE FELL.  BUT, WE WERE LUCKY THIS TIME.  THERE MUST BE A BETTER WAY TO MOUNT THOSE SAFETY STRAPS TO AVOID THIS TYPE OF THING.  WHEN THE PASSENGER IN THE MIDDLE SEAT IS STRAPPED IN, IT IS EVEN WORSE AS EACH PASSENGER PASSING TO THE REAR SEATS MUST WALK OVER OR UNDER THE STRAPS AS WELL.  IN THIS CASE, HOWEVER, SHE WAS THE ONLY PASSENGER AND THE \"RESTING\" STRAP STILL CAUGHT HER LEG AS SHE EXITED THE VEHICLE.  CLEARLY NOT SAFE IN MY OPINION.  JUST THOUGHT I'D PASS THIS ALONG.   *JB",
