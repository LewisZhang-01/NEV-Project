THE FIRST REPLACEMENT ACTUALLY MADE THE HORN MUCH WORSE.  THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.  BECAUSE MOTORCYCLES ARE HARDER TO SEE, I USE MY HORN TO WARN OTHER MOTORISTS OF MY PRESENCE.  WHEN MY HORN FAILS TO WORK, THIS CAN CREATE AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION, POSSIBLY RESULTING IN AN ACCIDENT, INJURIES, AND/OR DEATH.  *JB",
