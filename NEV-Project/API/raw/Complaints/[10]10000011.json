        "summary": "ON DEC 3, 2002 WHILE DRIVING  MY CHEVY TAHOE ON THE INTERSTATE,THE DRIVERS SEAT MALFUNCTIONED. THIS RESULTED IN THE SEAT MOVING AUTOMATICALLY AND UNCONTROLABLY  TO THE EXTREME FORWARD POSITION AND PINNING ME IN THE CAR. FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE OFF OF THE ROAD  SAFELY AND, AFTER TURNING THE VEHICLE OFF AND RESTARTING, THE SEAT STILL WOULD NOT RESPOND. I HAD EXTREME DIFFICULTY IN GETTING OUT OF THE VEHICLE - THIS IS QUITE SERIOUS. I THINK GM  OR  AGENCIES OTHER THAN GM SHOULD LOOK INTO THIS DEFECT BECAUSE OF THE OBVIOUS POTENTIAL FOR VERY SERIOUS INJURY. I SHUDDER TO THINK IF A PREGNANT WOMAN OR A VERY LARGE PERSON WERE BEHIND THE WHEEL WHEN THE SEAT MALFUNCTIONED AND COULD NOT FREE THEMSELVES FROM THE CRUSHING FORCE OF THE SEAT. I WAS LUCKY!!!  I CERTAINLY DO NOT WISH TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE WHILE NOT KNOWING WHAT TYPE OF UNEXPECTED DANGER I AM SUBJECTING MYSELF TO.",
