I T DOES NOT HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.  HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES WHERE THE VEHICLE WAS TRAVELLING AT HIGH SPEED AND THIS UNCOMMANDED IMPUT WAS ENOUGH TO INDUCE THE VEHICLE TO LURCH TO THE NEXT LANE.THIS SEVER ACTION ONLY HAPPENED ONCE,  HOWEVER AS THE VEHICLE AGES, THE SEVERITY SEEMS TO GET WORSE WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN. YJE VEHICLE HAS DONE THIS SINCE I PURCHASED IT NEW IN 1997.  I ALSO HAVE CONFIRMED THIS SAME THING WITH A FRIEND WHO OWNED A 1997 SABURBAN,  HE SOLD THE VEHICLE AS A RESULT OF THIS CONDITION.",
