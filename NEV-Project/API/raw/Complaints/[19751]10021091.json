WHILE TRAVELING AROUND 20-25 MPH, OCCASIONALLY THE TRANSMISSION IS UNABLE TO SHIFT TO 3RD GEAR. WHEN TRYING TO ACCELERATE, THE SLIPPAGE IS WITNESSED BY THE RPM'S RAPID CLIMB AT WHICH TIME I HAVE TO STEP ON THE BRAKE AND THEN TRY TO ACCELERATE AGAIN TO GET THE VEHICLE TO SHIFT.  THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING AND ESPECIALLY HAZARDOUS WHEN IN TRAFFIC ON A BUSY ROAD.  THE PROBLEM OCCURS AT LEAST ONCE PER WEEK,  BUT IS NOT REPRODUCABLE AT THE DEALERSHIP.*AK",
