PROBLEMS OCCUR IN CITY DRIVING CONDITIONS. RECENTLY, NOW AT 49100 MILES, 2ND GEAR ISN'T KICKING IN. DANGEROUS IN HEAVY TRAFFIC WHEN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC HAS  THE TENDENCY TO COME TO A STOP AND THEN GO BUT IF THE VEHICLE DOESN'T SHIFT TO SECOND GEAR. I NEED TO PULL OVER AND SHUT THE VEHICLE DOWN AND TURN IT BACK ON AND HOPE IT WILL TEMPORARY FIX. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT MY DEALERSHIP SAID I NEEDED AND OIL CHANGE (RECOMMENDED IS 60K FOR TRANSMISSION). I WENT AHEAD AND PAID FOR THIS SERVICE BUT THE PROBLEM STILL EXIST IN 2ND GEAR NOT SHIFTING IN. THE DEALER SERVICE ADVISOR SAID MY VEHICLE NEEDS TO RE-LEARN MY DRIVING CONDITIONS. I'M WEARY ABOUT THE ADVISORS EXPLANATION AND WILL FIND THAT AT 60K POWERTRAIN WARRANTY EXPIRATION. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WILL DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM AT MY COST. AS IT HAS OCCURRED WITH MY WINDOW MOTOR/REGULATOR. I REPORTED A DISTINCT NOISE WHEN OPERATING THE WINDOWS AT THE SAME MILEAGE NOTED ABOVE. NO PROBLEMS FOUND. TODAY MY VEHICLE IS IN THE SHOP FOR THE SAME PROBLEM BUT IT'S OUT OF WARRANTY AND I WILL BE RECEIVING A CALL WITH THE COST TO REPAIR IT.",
