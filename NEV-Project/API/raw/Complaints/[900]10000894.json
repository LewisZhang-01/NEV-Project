WE HAD TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO AVOID BEING CRUSHED BY ONCOMING TRAFFIC. THE DIAGNOSIS FROM THE DEALER WAS A FAILED IGNITION COIL PACK ON CYLINDER #3. THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH COIL PACKS ON AUDI/VW 1.8T ENGINES AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL TO PREVENT SERIOUS INJURIES. THIS FAILURE NEARLY CAUSED AN ACCIDENT AND WAS ONLY NARROWLY AVOIDED.",
