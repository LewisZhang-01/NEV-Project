ON 6/14/16 I TOOK MY CAR IN BECAUSE THE LIGHT WASNT GOING OFF. I WAS THEN INFORMED THAT IT WAS A SRS WARNING AND MY VEHICLE IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE. I WAS DISTRAUGHT TO FIND OUT THAT I HAD BEEN DRIVING AROUND ALL THIS TIME WITH MY SON AND OTHERS IN A DEFECTED CAR. BOMMARITO HONDA IN HAZELWOOD REFUSED TO FIX THE ISSUE BECAUSE MY WARRANTY EXPIRED MAY OF 2015. I COULDN'T AFFORD TO FIX IT MYSELF. SADLY THEY EVEN HAD A NOTE IN THE SYSTEM FORM FEBRUARY 2016 THAT THE SRS LIGHT WAS ON BUT NO ONE EVER INFORMED ME OF THE DANGER I WAS IN. SO I AM AGAIN DRIVING IN A UNSAFE VEHICLE BECAUSE HONDA AND THE SHOP MANAGER MATT FAIR DID NOT FEEL THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE.",
