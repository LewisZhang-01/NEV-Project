        "summary": "I WENT TO THE MIDAS AUTO SHOP LOCATED ON 8888 JAMACHA ROAD TO GET MY BRAKE SYSTEM BLED. WHEN I GOT THERE, THE MANAGER, NANCY, SAID THAT I NEEDED TO GET A THOROUGH BRAKE INSPECTION BEFORE GETTING ANYTHING DONE. I CONSENTED, AND SIGNED A CONSENT FORM. NOTE: PRIOR TO GOING TO THE AUTO SHOP, MY CAR WAS IN TOP RUNNING CONDITION, EXCEPT FOR THE BRAKE PROBLEM. AS SOON AS THE BRAKE INSPECTION WAS COMPLETED, NANCY TOLD ME THE OTHER \"PROBLEMS\" THAT MY CAR HAD TO GET FIXED IN ADDITION TO THE BRAKE SITUATION. IN ADDITION TO THAT SHE SAID THAT THE WHOLE BRAKE BLEEDING PROCEDURE AND THE REPLACEMENT OF A MASTER CYLINDER WOULD COST WAY MORE THAN I EXPECTED IT TO, SO I DECLINED TO GET MY CAR SERVICED BY THEM (MIDAS). I PAID THE $19.99 INSPECTION FEE AND LEFT THE AUTO SHOP.  ABOUT A MILE AWAY MY CAR STOPPED RUNNING. I TRIED TO RESTART IT, BUT IT WOULDN'T DO SO. I THEN OPENED THE HOOD TO CHECK WHAT COULD BE WRONG. I NOTICED A HOSE HANGING LOOSE BEHIND THE POWER STEERING COLUMN. IT HAD A CLEAN CUT ABOUT A HALF AN INCH LONG AT THE END. I ALSO SAW A CONNECTOR WITHOUT A HOSE CONNECTED TO IT. I KNEW THEN THAT SOMETHING WAS SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THE \"INSPECTION\" DONE AT MIDAS. THE HOSE THAT WAS CUT WAS IN GOOD CONDITION. IT WAS IN NO WAY DRY OR BRITTLE, AND COULD NOT HAVE FALLEN OFF ON ITS OWN. IT WAS A VACCUM HOSE CONNECTION THAT AIDED IN THE INTAKE OF AIR TO THE CARBUREATOR. WHEN IT WAS DISLOCATED FROM ITS JOINT CONNECTOR, NO AIR WENT THROUGH TO THE CARBUREATOR, THUS MAKING MY CAR STALL FOR LACK OF A GOOD AIR/FUEL MIX. I AM THOROUGHLY DISGUSTED WITH THIS INCIDENT AND I AM ACTIVELY SEEKING  LEGAL CONSULTATION ABOUT THIS MATTER.",
