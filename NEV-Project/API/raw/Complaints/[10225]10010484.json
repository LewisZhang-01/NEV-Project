EVERYTHING WORKED (LIGHTS, RADIO), BUT THE ENGINE WOULDN'T \"TURN OVER.\" COULDN'T START SATURDAY, TOW-TRUCK DRIVER COULDN'T START MONDAY. CALL FROM SERVICE CENTER TUESDAY, CAR STARTED WHEN TECH TRIED, PUT THROUGH DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, NOTHING FOUND WRONG. THREE WEEKS LATER, SAME THING HAPPENED. CAR STARTS AGAIN AT SERVICE CENTER. TECHNICIAN TELLS ME THE THEFT DETERRENT MODULE NEEDS REPLACING. CAR \"THINKS\" ITS BEING STOLEN, SO IT CUTS OFF THE FUEL PUMP. MOTION OF BEING PUT ON TOW TRUCK PROBABLY CAUSES SHORTAGE. COST $400+  (2)SIGNAL LIGHTS SOME TIMES STOP WORKING FOR SEVERAL HOURS.   *JB",
