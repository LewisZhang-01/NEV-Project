TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE NEITHER GM OR THE DEALERSHIPS KNOWS WHAT IS CAUSING THE VIBRATION.  IT IS WITH OUT A DOUBT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING.  I ALSO KNOW OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME SUV HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.  DOES IT DO DAMAGE TO MY SUV EVERY TIME IT HAPPENS?  MOST IMPORTANTLY IT HAPPENS AT HIGHWAY SPEED.  I DON'T WANT SOMETHING TO GO WRONG AT 54 MPH.  THANK YOU.  ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME.   *PLEASE NOTE I ENTERED TODAYS DATE BELOW BUT IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND HAS BEEN SINCE I BOUGHT THE SUV BRAND NEW.",
