        "summary": "WHEN I BROUGHT MY CAR TO RAMSEY VOLVO FOR SERVICE, VOLVO RECOMMENDED THE ANGLE GEAR RESEAL SERVICE BECAUSE THE ANGLE GEAR BOX IS LEAKING AS SHOWN IN THE ATTACHED PICTURE.  UPON FURTHER RESEARCH, I FOUND THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON ISSUE WITH ALL VOLVO XC90S, SO MUCH SO THAT IT CAN BE CLASSIFIED AS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT, AND QUALIFIES AS A RECALL IN MY OPINION.  THE ANGLE GEAR BOX IS AN UNDISTURBED PART AND IS SUPPOSED TO BE SEALED FOR THE LIFETIME OF THE CAR.  WHEN THE FLUID IN THE ANGLE GEAR BOX IS COMPLETELY LEAKED OUT, WHICH IS SOMETHING WITH NO INDICATION WHATSOEVER, THE CAR WOULD LOSE ALL WHEEL DRIVE ACCORDING TO VOLVO.  WHEN THAT HAPPENS IN A SLIPPERY SITUATION WITH ICE OR SNOW, THE CAR IS MOST LIKELY TO LOSE CONTROL AND WOULD LEAD TO A SERIOUS ACCIDENT WITH POTENTIAL LOSS OF LIVES.  I WOULD LIKE VOLVO TO VOLUNTARILY RECALL ALL VOLVO XC90S TO FIX ALL LEAKING ANGLE GEAR BOXES SO NO LIVES WOULD BE LOST.",
