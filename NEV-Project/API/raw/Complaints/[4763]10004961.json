        "summary": "I BOUGHT A NEW 2002 VOLKSWAGEN GOLF GTI  1.8T ON JUNE 22, 2002.  ON JANUARY 29, 2003 I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I HAD PURCHASED IT FOR THE #2 IGNITION COIL FAILURE.  AT THAT TIME, THE CAR ONLY HAD 10,600 MILES ON IT.  NOW, AS I DRIVE DOWN ROUTE 93 FROM NH TO MASS EACH DAY FOR WORK, I BRACE MYSELF FOR THE TIME THAT THE NEXT COIL FAILS.  EACH TIME THIS HAPPENS, THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE LOSS IN POWER, TO THE POINT THAT THE CAR CAN STALL.   THE CAR BEGINS TO \"BUCK\" AND STAGGER, AND AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, THIS BECOMES VERY DANGEROUS.  AS VOLKSWAGEN IS WELL AWARE, THIS IS AN EPIDEMIC PROBLEM WITH THE 1.8T ENGINES IN ALL OF THEIR CARS.  THEY REFUSE TO REPLACE ALL 4 COILS AT ONCE.  THEREFORE, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME THAT THIS HAPPENS AGAIN TO MY CAR, AS WELL AS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BUYERS THAT HAVE EITHER EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM ALREADY OR WILL BE.  THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL ON THESE PARTS, OR AT THE VERY LEAST, AN INVESTIGATION ON THE IGNITION COILS AND THE LOSS OF SAFETY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPARABLE LOSS OF POWER.  HOPEFULLY, THIS CAN BE DONE BEFORE SOMEONE GETS INJURED OR KILLED.",
