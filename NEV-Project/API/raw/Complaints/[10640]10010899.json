        "summary": "REAR TIRES BALD AT 20,000. I HAVE REPLACED 4 TIRES AND NEED TO REPLACE 2 MORE. I HAVE 42,000 MILES ON MY CAR. I HAVE ROTATED THE TIRES ALL ALONG, BUT THEY ALWAYS END UP WEARING QUICK IN THE REAR. FOR EXAMPLE ONE SET OF TIRES HAD GREAT TREAD WHEN THEY WERE ROTATED TO THE BACK WITH ABOUT 15,000, THEN AT 20,000 THEY WERE BALD!!! (LIKE SOMETHING IN THE REAR CHEWED THEM UP) CAR JUMPS SIDE TO SIDE WHEN HITTING MINOR BUMPS IN ROAD AND ON HIGHWAY, IT FEELS LIKE CAR DOESN'T HAVE GOOD CONTROL BECAUSE OF THIS. DEALERSHIP AND FORD REP. SAY TIRES ARE NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY OF COURSE AND CLAIM NOT TO FIND ANY OTHER PROBLEMS. THEY BLAME IT ON THE DRIVER STYLE. FUNNY THIS HAS NEVER EVER HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE, INCLUDING MY FIRST FOCUS LEMON I HAD FOR 25,000 MILES (THEY REPLACED MY FIRST FOCUS FOR US FOR FUEL PROBLEMS THEY COULDN'T FIX) I KICK MYSELF FOR AGREEING TO EXCHANGE FOR A NEW FOCUS. NEVERTHELESS, IT REALLY SEEMS LIKE AN ENGINEERING/DESIGN FLAW OR SOMETHING ELSE IN THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE THAT IS MAKING THESE TIRES WEAR SO FAST.  *JB",
