FROM A PARKED POSITION, I PUT THE VEHICLE IN REVERSE AND PROCEED TO BACK UP.  ONCE I HAVE COMPLETED BACKING OUT, I PUT THE VEHICLE IN DRIVE TO (ATTEMPT) GO FORWARD.  THE VEHICLE IS IN DRIVE, HOWEVER THE VEHICLE CONTINUES TO GO IN REVERSE (SEVERAL FEET).  I HAVE TRIED SHIFTING TO OVERDRIVE, NEUTRAL, AND PARK  HOWEVER THE VEHICLE STILL CONTINUES TO MOVE IN REVERSE.  I HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP 5 TIMES AND THE PROBLEM STILL HASN'T BEEN RESOLVED.  THIS IS A SEVERE HAZARD AS I HAVE ALMOST HAD SEVERAL ACCIDENTS, ASSUMING THE MY VEHICLE SHOULD BE MOVING FORWARD WHEN IN DRIVE.  THE SERVICE MANAGER DOES NOT WANT TO ADMIT THERE IS A PROBLEM, HE BLAMES IT ON ME NOT PUTTING MY BRAKE ALL THE WAY DOWN.  I ADVISED HIM THAT DESPITE THE POSITION ON MY BRAKE IF THE VEHICLE IS IN DRIVE IT SHOULD MOVE FORWARD OR IF IT IS IN PARK IT SHOULD NOT MOVE AT ALL.  THE VEHICLE EVENTUALLY MOVES FORWARD, BUT NOT UNTIL IT IS READY.  MY TRANSMISSION FLUID IS CLEAN AND FULL.   MY MILEAGE NOW IS APPROX 25471.  THE VEHICLE IS USED FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY.",
