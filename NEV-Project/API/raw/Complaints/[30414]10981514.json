I TOOK IT TO MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FOR YEARS AND HAVE DONE NOTHING AND WOULD DO NOTHING TO FIX IT.  THEY TOLD ME TO CALL FORD.  I CALLED FORD AND THEY TOLD ME TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WRITE A LETTER OF COMPLAINT TO FORD.  NOTHING IS RESOLVED.  IF THERE IS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ON THIS MATTER, PLEASE ADD MY NAME TO THE LIST OF CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE BEEN WRONGED.  I HAVE ALWAYS OWNED FORDS BUT WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER IF THEY DO NOT MAKE THIS RIGHT.",
