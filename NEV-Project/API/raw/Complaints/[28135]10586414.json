        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING MY 03 SIERRA, APPROACHING A STOPLIGHT AT A BUSY INTERSECTION WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKES.  THE TRUCK BEGAN TO SLOW AT FIRST BUT THEN THE PEDDLE IMMEDIATELY WENT COMPLETELY TO THE FLOOR.  I BEGAN TO PUMP IT BUT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE.  I WAS HEADING TOWARD THE INTERSECTION, THE LIGHT WAS RED, WITH BUSY CROSS TRAFFIC.  THE STREET I WAS ON IS NARROW AND STEEP AND I BEGAN TO PICK UP SPEED.  I SHIFTED THE TRANS INTO THE LOWEST GEAR AND STEPPED ON THE EMERGENCY BRAKE.  THE TRUCK FINALLY CAME TO A STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION, AS ONCOMING CARS LUCKILY AVOIDED HITTING ME.  WHEN I WENT TO MY MECHANIC TO ARRANGE TO HAVE THE TRUCK TOWED,  HE KNEW IMMEDIATELY WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.  HE TOLD ME, SIGHT UNSEEN, THAT THE BRAKE LINE UNDER THE DRIVER'S SIDE HAD RUPTURED.  LATER, UPON INSPECTION,  HE WAS CORRECT.  HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THAT YEAR.  HE REPLACED THE LINE AND I THOUGHT THAT HAD SOLVED THE PROBLEM; UNTIL TWO DAYS AGO.  AGAIN, I AM DRIVING DOWN A HILL AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED.  I WAS TOWING A VERY LARGE TRAILER THIS TIME AND THE EMERGENCY BRAKE HAD LITTLE AFFECT.  LUCKILY, THERE WAS LITTLE TRAFFIC AND I WAS ABLE TO RIDE IT OUT WITHOUT INCIDENT.  I HAVE SINCE DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH NOT ONLY THE 03 YEAR BUT 4 OR 5 YEARS PRIOR ALSO.  ANOTHER MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF LINES SHOULD BE REPLACED SINCE GM USED A UNCOATED STEEL WHICH BEGINS TO BE COMPROMISED WITHIN JUST A FEW YEARS WHERE SALT IS HEAVILY USED IN THIS AREA.    IT IS OBVIOUS THAT GM USED UNCOATED STEEL INSTEAD OF COATED OR STAINLESS TO SAVE A FEW DOLLARS.  HAD MY 17 YEAR OLD SON BEEN DRIVING,  THE OUTCOME COULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS.  THIS IS ONLY ONE OF MANY PROBLEMS I HAVE HAD WITH THIS TRUCK.  ANOTHER IS ERRONEOUS SPEEDOMETER READINGS.  I WILL ADDRESS THESE IN ANOTHER POST.  *TR",
