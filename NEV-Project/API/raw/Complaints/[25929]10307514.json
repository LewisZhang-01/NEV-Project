THIS HAPPENED UNDER NORMAL DAILY DRIVING TO WORK AND BACK.  IT COST ME $369.00 TO REPLACE THE CLUTCH PEDAL ASSEMBLY WITH A NEW ONE.  I DON'T THINK THAT THIS SHOULD HAPPEN UNDER NORMAL DRIVING CIRCUMSTANCES.  THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL ITEM BECAUSE IF I DID NOT TAKE IT INTO THE DEALER RIGHT AWAY, THE CRACK WOULD HAVE LED TO A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE.",
