NEITHER OF THE AIR BAGS IN MY VENTURE VAN WENT OFF. THE FRONT BUMPER, HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY, GRILL AND HOLD WERE ALL DAMAGED. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND POLICE DEPARTMENT WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I MAKE A COMPLAINT WITH YOU BECAUSE THEY STATED THAT BOTH AIR BAGS SHOULD HAVE WENT OFF. AS FAR AS I KNOW THERE IS NO SWITCH TO TURN EITHER AIR BAG OFF.",
