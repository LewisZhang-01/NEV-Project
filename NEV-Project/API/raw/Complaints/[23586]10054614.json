THEY ASSURED ME THEY WOULD REPAIR THE BRAKES AND CALL ME WHEN THE CAR WAS READY FOR SALE. AFTER THE REPAIR, I PURCHASED THE CAR, BUT THE BRAKES SOON FAILED AGAIN. I THEN DISCOVERED THAT THE BRAKE LINE REPAIR HAD BEEN MADE WITH COMPRESSION FITTINGS INSTEAD OF HIGH-PRESSURE INVERTED-FLARE HYDRAULIC FITTINGS. I SUSPECT THIS WAS UNLAWFUL. I CONTACTED GENERAL MOTORS, AND THE AGENT I TALKED TO DOESN'T SEEM TO COMPREHEND THAT THE USE OF COMPRESSION FITTINGS IN A BRAKE LINE IS UNLAWFUL, AND TRIVIALIZES MY CONCERNS SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR \"AS-IS\".*AK",
