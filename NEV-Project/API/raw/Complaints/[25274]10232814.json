STALLING OCCURS MOST OFTEN WHEN SLOWING TO A STOP BUT HAS HAPPENED ON THE FREEWAY AT SPEED. VEHICLE NOW HAS 85K MILES ON IT AND PROBLEM IS STILL OCCURRING. HAS BEEN TO DEALER SEVERAL TIMES BUT NO \"CODES\" ARE SET AND THEY CANNOT DUPLICATE PROBLEM (SOMETHING ABOUT MANUFACTURER WILL NOT \"ALLOW\" THEM TO PERFORM EXTENDED DRIVING TO DUPLICATE FAILURE CONDITIONS). ON A FEW OCCASIONS THE ENGINE HAS STALLED IN TRAFFIC SITUATIONS WHERE ACCIDENTS WERE NARROWLY AVOIDED. WE NO LONGER FEEL SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE AS IT IS JUST A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL A SERIOUS ACCIDENT WILL OCCUR DUE TO THIS STALLING.  *TR",
