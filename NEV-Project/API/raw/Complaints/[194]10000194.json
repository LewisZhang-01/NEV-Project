THE DRIVERS SEAT LEFT FRONT SEAT BOLT THAT HOLDS THE SEAT TO THE ANGLE IRON FRAME PULLED OUT OF OR THROUGH THE METAL OF THE SEAT.  THE CAR HAS NOT BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT AND THE AIR BAG HAS NEVER BEEN DEPLOYED SO THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY EXTREME FORCE ON THE SEAT OTHER THAN DRIVING.  I WEIGH 200 LBS. AND DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED TO BE EXCESSIVE.
