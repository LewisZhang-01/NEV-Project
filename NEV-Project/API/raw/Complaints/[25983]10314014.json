THE WHEELS WOULD NOT STOP UNTIL THE TRACTION CONTROL  IS TURNED OFF BY THE DRIVER.   THE CONDITION IS NOT DESCRIBED IN THE MANUAL OF THE CAR AND IT WAS JUST PURE LUCK THAT I AVOIDED AN ACCIDENT AFTER BEING IN SUCH A SITUATION.  ANYBODY DRIVING THIS CAR WITH ABS AND TRACTION CONTROL SHOULD KNOW THAT WHEELS WILL NOT COMPLETELY STOP UNDER ICY CONDITIONS, NO MATTER HOW THEY WILL HANDLE THE BRAKES.   CHEVROLET SHOULD WARN ABOUT THIS VERY DANGEROUS CONDITION IN THE MANUAL, (WHICH OTHERWISE HAS TENS OF USELESS REDUNDANT WARNINGS, BUT NOTHING ABOUT THE ABOVE MENTIONED SITUATION).   AN IMPORTANT DETAIL - THE ROAD WAS IN A SLOW DESCENDING SLOPE. CONSISTENT WITH THE ABS AND TRACTION CONTROL WORKING NOISES, THE SYSTEM SEEMED TO WORK CONTINUOUSLY - BUT THE FINAL RESULT WAS THE CAR ROLLING FREELY AND NOT COMING TO A STOP UNTIL TRACTION CONTROL BUTTON WAS TURNED OFF.  PLEASE CHECK CONDITION WITH MANUFACTURER AND HAVE A LABEL APPLIED ON THE DASHBOARD ABOUT THIS CONDITION - OR POST A WARNING IN THE MANUAL.[XXX]  *TR",
