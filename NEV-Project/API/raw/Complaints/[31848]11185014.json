IT TOOK 20-30 MINUTES TO GET THE KEY OUT. IT BEGAN TO HAPPEN MORE FREQUENTLY AND AS I RESEARCHED I FOUND THAT THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH HYUNDAI SONATA'S IN GENERAL. TO REMOVE THE KEY, A PERSON WOULD NEED TO PULL UP ON THE SHIFT LEVER, PUT SOMETHING IN THE SHIFT LOCK RELEASE (SUCH AS A PEN OR SMALL WRENCH) OR IF ALL ELSE FAILS DISCONNECT THE BATTERY. I WAS SENT BY THE DEALER TO A LOCKSMITH, BUT THEY SHARED IT WAS SOMETHING IN THE SHIFT LEVER ITSELF. I WAS RECOMMENDED TO PUT WD 40 IN THE IGNITION, BUT THAT DID NOT SOLVE THE ISSUE. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE, THEY NEED TO REPLACE THE SHIFT LEVER ASSEMBLY, TO WHICH I WAS TOLD IT WAS A COMMON PROBLEM AND THAT THEY HAD PERFORMED SEVERAL WITHIN THE LAST FEW WEEKS. AS OF NOW, MY CAR HAS BEEN REPAIRED.",
