APPLIED BREAK, IMMEDIATELY BRAKE PEDAL SUNK TO THE FLOOR, BREAK LIGHT ON DASH CAME ON, FRONT BREAKS BEGAN MAKING HARSH GRINDING SOUNDS (AS WHEN SLIP CONTROL ENACTS); HAD THERE BEEN CARS IN FRONT OF ME I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STOP W/OUT HITTING THEM.  EVEN WITH FOOT TO FLOOR VEHICLE DID NOT STOP, DOWN SHIFTED INTO 1ST GEAR, AND FINALLY VEHICLE SLOWED AND WAS ABLE TO STOP.  PULLED OVER AND TURNED OFF CAR; AFTER TURNING CAR BACK ON BRAKE LIGHT ON DASH HAD GONE AWAY AND BRAKES WERE ACTING NORMAL.   THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD AND SOMEONE MAY DIE FROM THIS. THE FRONT DISCS ON THIS VEHICLE ARE NO GOOD EVEN AFTER INFINITI/NISSAN HAS DONE THEIR  SO CALLED REPAIR AND CONTINUE TO PREMATURELY WARP.A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT NEEDS TO BE FORMED TO DEAL RESOLVE THIS MATTER INDEFINITELY.
