SLOWING DOWN AND MAKING A COMPLETE STOP. ACCELERATING TO MOVE ON BUT CAR IS NOT RESPONDING. RPM STAYS AT 600 EVEN THOUGH GAS PEDAL IS PRESSED DOWN. THIS CAN LAST 3 TO 6 SECONDS. FINALLY CAR STARTS MOVING. I WANTED TO PARK ON A FAIRLY STEEP STREET IN SAN FRANCISCO ON 10.06.2016. ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT I WAS TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE SIDE OF THE STREET. PUT CAR INTO REVERSE AND ATTEMPTED TO BACK UP. AGAIN THE ENGINE STAYED AT 600 RPM AND DID NOT MOVE AT ALL. SINCE I WAS FACING DOWNHILL THE CAR STARTED TO ROLL DOWNWARDS. ONLY MY QUICK REACTION I STEPPED ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AND PRESSED IT AS HARD AS I COULD. CAR CAME TO A STANDSTILL INCHES AWAY FROM ANOTHER CAR THAT WAS PARKED. THIS KIND OF PROBLEM IS BEEN ONGOING.",
