        "summary": "IN FULFILLMENT OF RECALL 02008-S, A GM DEALERSHIP CLAIMS THAT REPLACEMENT OF THE STARTER WIRING HARNESS WILL DESTROY THE TERMINAL ON THE SOLENOID, RESULTING IN THE REQUIRED REPLACEMENT OF BOTH THE SOLENOID AND STARTER MOTOR. BOTH PARTS ARE IN GOOD WORKING ORDER BUT GM WILL NOT COVER THE COST OF THIS DAMAGE, APPROX $260. IN SHORT, A RUSTY TERMINAL WILL PROBABLY BREAK WHEN REMOVED. FOR THIS, GM WANTS TO SELL A NEW STARTER WITH SOLENOID AT FULL PRICE. I HAVE CONFIRMED THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE DAMAGE WITH AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC. GM REFUSED ME DIRECTLY UPON APPEAL. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT RECALL, THOUGH RELATIVELY SIMPLE TO IMPLEMENT. THE CAR IS ONLY 7 YEARS OLD. GM SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO COVER THE FULL COST OF IMPLEMENTATION, WITHOUT PROFITING ON AN OTHERWISE UNNECESSARY REPLACEMENT OF EXPENSIVE COMPONENTS. GM COULD REPLACE JUST THE SOLENOID OR PERHAPS EVEN JUST THE TERMINAL. THE WIRE LEAD COULD BE PROPERLY SPLICED WITHOUT TERMINAL REMOVAL. THIS POSSIBILITY (OR PERHAPS PROBABILITY) WAS NOT MENTIONED IN THE RECALL NOTICE OR IN CONVERATIONS WITH THE DEALER PRIOR TO THE RECALL WORK. I AM ARRANGING TO HAVE THE SOLENOID ALONE REPLACED FOR APPROX. $140. I SUGGEST THAT GM BE ORDERED TO REIMBURSE CUSTOMERS FOR THIS AND OTHER COSTS REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT THE RECALL FULLY AND TO COVER THEM DIRECTLY FROM THIS POINT FORWARD. I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT GM HAS ALREADY INSTALLED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF NEW STARTERS AT OWNERS' EXPENSE.",
