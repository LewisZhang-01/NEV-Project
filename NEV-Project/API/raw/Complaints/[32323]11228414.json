THE FIRST TWO TIMES THEY RESET THE SENSOR AND IT WOULD STAY FIXED FOR 2 MONTHS. I JUST TOOK IT BACK THE 3RD TIME. THE DEALER SAID THE AIRBAG WOULD NOT DEPLOY IN AN ACCIDENT. SINCE IT WAS A SAFETY ISSUE NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY, I CHOSE FOR THEM TO FIX MY VEHICLE. THE OCS SENSOR AND CONTROL MODULE WAS FAULTY. IT COST ME $652.56 TO REPAIR IT. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY SINCE THIS WAS A SAFETY ISSUE. I WANT TO REPORT THIS ISSUE TO YOU SINCE IT WAS A SAFETY ISSUE. I DO NOT WANT ANYONE DYING IN A CAR ACCIDENT DUE TO THE AIRBAG NOT DEPLOYING.",
