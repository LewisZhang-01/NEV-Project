        "summary": "WHEN I AM IN STOP-AND-GO TRAFFIC AFTER 30-45  MINUTES OF TIME THE ENGINE IDLES VERY FAST.  I HAVE TO KEEP MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE VERY HARD TO KEEP VEHICLE STOPPED.  WHEN I TAKE MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE THE ENGINE RPM READS 1100 (IF THE PROBLEM IS NOT OCCURRING IT IS USUALLY 750 RPM IN IDLE OR WHEN STOPPED) WITHOUT PUTTING MY FOOT ON THE ACCELERATOR THE CARS DRIVES AT 30 MPH (ALMOST AS IF IT IN CRUISE CONTROL MODE EVEN THOUGH THE CRUISE CONTROL IS NOT ENGAGED)  WHEN THIS IS OCCURRING AND I COME TO A STOP AND PUT THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL OR PARK THE ENGINE RACES TO 3000 RPM AND SEEMS STUCK AT THAT LEVEL.  I  RECENTLY SERVICED THE VEHICLE INCLUDING THROTTLE BOX CLEANING BUT THE PROBLEM PERSISTS ON AN INTERMITTENT BASIS.  THE DEALER TELLS ME THAT THE \"COMPUTER\" DOES NOT SHOW A TROUBLE CODE.  THEY RECOMMEND THAT I BRING IT IN WHEN IT IS OCCURRING.  THE PROBLEM IS NOT COMPLETELY PREDICTABLE AND WHEN IT DOES OCCUR IT IS USUALLY IN THE 5:00-7:00 PM DRIVE TIME, THE DEALER IS CLOSED.  I HAVE ASKED THEN TO ALSO LOOK AT THE THROTTLE SENSOR WHICH THEY SAY THEY WILL.  I FEEL THAT THE SITUATION COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS AS THERE IS A SENSE THAT I AM NOT IN CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE'S SPEED WHEN THIS OCCURS.  THANK YOU.   *NLM",
