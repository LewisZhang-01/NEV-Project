        "summary": "VERLAND IS AN ICF/MR FACILITY IN SEWICKLEY PA.  WE USE OUR VEHICLES DAILY TO TRANSPORT OUR CLIENTS TO THEIR PROGRAMS, DR'S. APPTS, ETC.  WE PURCHASED A 2002 CHEVROLET VENTURE MINI VAN IN NOVEMBER 2001.  THE SAME VAN HAS HAD 3 INSTANCES WHERE THE WHEEL STUDS HAVE BROKEN AND THE FRONT TIRE HAS COME LOOSE.  OUR STAFF HAS NOTICED THE PROBLEM AND GOTTEN OFF OF THE ROAD BEFORE ANY ACCIDENT HAS HAPPENED.  WE HAVE CONTACTED CHEVROLET AS WELL AS THE SELLING DEALER AND THEY REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH THE VAN AND THEY HAVE PUT THE BLAME ON US.  THE LATEST FAILURE WAS ON 12/10/02 AND A TOW TRUCK WAS CALLED TO TOW THE VAN TO A CHEVROLET DEALER.  THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER COMMENTED THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN THIS PROBLEM OCCUR ON ANY VEHICLE, LET ALONE A NEW VAN, AND HE WAS AN IMPARTIAL OBSERVER TO THE PROBLEM.  I WAS INFORMED BY THIS CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP THAT THE PROBLEM WOULDN'T BE COVERED BY CHEVROLET AND THE COST WAS $401.32.  THIS VAN HAS 23,000 MILES AND SHOULD STILL BE COVERED UNDER THE \"BUMPER TO BUMPER\" WARRANTY.  I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ANYTHING EXCEPT TO HAVE THE VAN REPAIRED.  WE HAVE BEEN LUCKY THAT WE HAVE HAD NO INJURIES TO OUR STAFF OR CLIENTS AS WELL AS THE GENERAL PUBLIC YET.  ANY HELP YOU COULD PROVIDE WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.",
