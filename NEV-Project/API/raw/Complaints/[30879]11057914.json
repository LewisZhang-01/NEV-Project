        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING ON THE I89 NORTH IN CONCORD, NH WHEN THE CAR SUDDENLY STOPPED ACCELERATING AND THE RPMS WENT REALLY HIGH.  I HEARD A SPINNING NOISE - LIKE SOMETHING WAS SPINNING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED.  PRESSING THE GAS PEDDLE DIDN'T INCREASE THE CARS SPEED.  THEN I SHIFTED TO THE MANUAL MODE AND TRIED TO USE THE GEAR SHIFTING PADDLES TO SHIFT.  I WAS ABLE TO GET IT TO A GEAR TO GET ME TO THE NEXT EXIT EVEN THOUGH IT KEPT SHIFTING IN AND OUT OF GEAR WHILE I PROCEEDED SLOWLY OFF THE HIGHWAY.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON STEADY.    AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS THIS WAS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT PUT MYSELF AND EVERYONE AROUND ME AT RISK OF A MAJOR ACCIDENT.      ONCE I WAS OFF THE HIGHWAY AND SAFE, I PLUGGED IN MY DIAGNOSTICS TOOL I CARRY IN MY CAR (I TOOK A AUTO REPAIR CLASS A FEW YEARS BACK).  THE DIAGNOSIS CODES THE CARS COMPUTER PROVIDED ARE P0776 AND P0700 - INDICATING A MAJOR MALFUNCTION OF THE TRANSMISSION AND A SOLENOID PROBLEM.  I TOOK A PHOTO OF THE CODES.    I FOUND OUT TODAY THAT THERE IS AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THE SAME ISSUE ON THE 2009 CHEVY MALIBU'S.  THE EXTENDED THE WARRANTY FROM 5/100K TO 10/120K.  CLEARLY GM SHOULD DO THE SAME FOR THE 2010 MODELS AS WELL.  IT'S THE SAME 6 SPEED TRANSMISSION.",
