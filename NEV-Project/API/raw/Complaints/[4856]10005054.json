ONE PROBLEM IS A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT THAT KEEPS COMING ON.  IT HAS BEEN CHECKED OUT WITH THE DEALER, AND WHILE THEY TURN IT OFF, IT HAS COME ON TWICE MORE.  THE SECOND PROBLEM IS A VIBRATION THAT COMES FROM THE FRONT END FO THE CAR, AND IS FELT THROUGH THE STEERING WHEEL.  THIS OCCURS DURING DEACCELERATION AT SPEEDS OF 60 MPH OR HIGHER.  THIS HAS ALSO BEEN BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE DEALER WHICH SAYS THE PROBLEM IS DUE TO WARPED ROTORS.  I HAVE CHANGED THEM TWICE SINCE PURCHASING THE VEHICLE, AND THE CAR ONLY NOW HAS 37,000 MILES.  FINALLY THERE IS  A CONSTANT ROUGHNESS TO THE RIDE OF THE CAR AS IF THERE IS NO SUSPENSION SUPPORTING THE CAR.  ALSO THERE IS A CONSTANT CLICKING NOISE COMING FROM THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE.   COMPLAINTS AND REPAIRS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION AND DONE BY THE DEALER, BUT PROBLEMS STILL PERSIST.",
