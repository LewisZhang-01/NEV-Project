FIRST TIME I COMPLAINED ABOUT IT, SUBARU SAID THAT I WASN'T DRIVING IT PROPERLY.  3RD TIME I REPORTED IT (AT 15,000 MI), SUBARU ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROBLEM AND THEY ARE NOW GOING TO REPLACE THE CLUTCH. THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD NOT REPLACE IT WITH A HEAVIER DUTY CLUTCH SO THE PROBLEM MAY OCCUR AGAIN.     *JB",
