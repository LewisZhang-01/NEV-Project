I AM A HEART TRANSPLANT SURVIVOR OF 15 YRS AND DID NO NEED TO BE PUT THROUGH THIS KIND OF SCARE!  I DUG THROUGH SOME PAPERS AND FOUND AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THIS ISSUE THAT STATED NOT TO BRING IT IN UNTIL IT STARTED TO DO THIS.  OF COURSE THE TIME OF THE EXTENDED WARRANTY RAN OUT AND CHEVY WOULD NOT HONOR THE WARRANTY AND REPAIR THEIR MISTAKE!  I INHERITED THIS VEHICLE FROM MY MOTHER IN 2015 WITH 29,000 MILE ON IT!  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH RELEASING THIS VEHICLE TO THE PUBLIC WITH THIS ISSUE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAPPEN!  THEY SHOULD HAVE STEPPED UP AND REPAIRED THESE VEHICLES BEFORE THIS COULD HAPPEN.  THE CAUSE OF THIS MALFUNCTION WAS A CRACKED SPARK PLUG OF THE THIRD CYLINDER!  WILL NEVER BY A GM PRODUCT!  I WAS CONTACTED BY CHEVROLET AND BECAUSE IT HAD OVER 19,500 MILES THEY WOULD NOT REIMBURSE FOR REPAIRS! THEY REPLIED THT THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS SAFETY, HOW WHEN THEY CAN LET SOMETHING LIKE THIS OUT INTO THE PUBLIC.",
