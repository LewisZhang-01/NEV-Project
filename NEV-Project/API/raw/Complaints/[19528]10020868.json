THE BUTTON ,LOCATED IN THE TOP LEFT SIDE OF THE HANDLE,THAT HAS TO BE PRESSED WHILE APPLYING  BRAKE PEDAL WILL NOT GO ALL THE WAY IN.  SINCE THE DATE OF PURCHASED, EVERYDAY WHEN PUTTING GEAR FROM PARK TO DRIVE I HAD TO WAIT 30 MINUTES OR MORE BEFORE THE KNOB CAN BE PUSHED ALL THE WAY IN.  I THOUGHT THIS WAS NORMAL FOR AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION UNTIL TODAY (1 JUNE 03).  THE BUTTON WAS COMPLETELY PARALIZED.  MY CAR HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE NEAREST KIA SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  THEY ARE CLOSED ON SUNDAYS.  TOMORROW (MONDAY) I WILL REPORT THE PROBLEM TO KIA.  I THINK ALL 2001 KIA SEPHIA WITH AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION MUST BE RECALLED FOR THE MALFUNCTIONING THAT MY CAR HAD.  *AK",
