THE PUBLISHED DRY HITCH WEIGHT IS 736#; THE ACTUAL DRY HITCH WEIGHT IS APPROXIMATELY 1500#. THE PUBLISHED BOX LENGTH IS 28 FEET, THE ACTUAL BOX LENGTH IS 30 FEET.  THE NUMBER OF AXLES ON A 30 FOOT TRAILER IS PUBLISHED AS 3, MY TRAILER HAS 2.  I PURCHASED THE DUNES TRAILER ON THE BASIS OF THE PUBLISHED DATA, PARTICULARLY THE HITCH WEIGHT.  THE ACTUAL HITCH WEIGHT EXCEEDS THE LIMIT OF MY TOW VEHICLE (AS WELL AS MOST FACTORY EQUIPPED OTHERS) BY 500# OR 50%. I AM UNABLE TO USE THIS TRAILER (AND THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHERS OUT THERE) BECAUSE IT IS UNSAFE TO EXCEED THE LIMITATIONS OF THE TOW VEHICLE.  I BELIEVE THAT THIS TRAILER WAS MANUFACTURED INCORRECTLY. I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. THEY HAVE BEEN TOTALLY NON-RESPONSIVE. I WISH TO HAVE THE TRAILER REPAIRED OR REPLACED.  DUNES TRAILERS ARE MANUFACTURED BY:  CURTIS INDUSTRIES 351 SOUTH FRANK BLAND SAN BERNARDINO, CA 92408  909-382-4208.     *NLM      INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
