ON APRIL 2, THE FRONT ROTORS WERE REPLACED FOR THE SAME REASON, AND THE REAR ROTORS WERE AGAIN IDENTIFIED BY THE DEALER TECH WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. HOWEVER, THE MANUFACTURER WOULD ONLY REPLACE THE FRONT ROTORS. WITH 20000 MILES TOTAL ON THE CAR, MY FRONT BRAKE PADS HAVE 60% LEFT, MY REAR 30%. I SUSPECT A MALFUNCTION WITH THE BRAKE CALIPERS AND / OR BRAKE ROTOR DESIGN. *JB",
