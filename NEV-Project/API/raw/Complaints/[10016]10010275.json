        "summary": "IT IS AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM.  THE SPEEDOMETER GETS STUCK ON A NUMBER BUT THE CAR IS STILL GOING FASTER OR SLOWER THAN SHOWN ON THE DISPLAY.  IT STAYS STUCK FOR A FEW MINUTES WHEN IT HAPPENS.  I TRY  NOT ACCELERATE AND EVEN APPLY THE BRAKE, HOWEVER, THE NEEDLE REMAINS STUCK.  THEN IT EVENTUALLY GOES BACK TO NORMAL. IT JUST RECENTLY HAPPENED AGAIN, SO I WAS CHECKING TO SEE IF A RECALL WAS ISSUED FOR THIS PROBLEM.  IT WAS INVESTIGATED AS I SEE HERE, HOWEVER, IT WAS NOT RECALLED.  THIS IS A DEFECT.  I AM SURE, NOT POSITIVE THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR CARAVANS.  NOTE, AUTOMOBILE STILLS ACCELERATES AND SLOWS BUT THE ACTUAL SPEED IS NOT KNOWN BECAUSE THE NEEDLE IS STUCK.  *JB",
