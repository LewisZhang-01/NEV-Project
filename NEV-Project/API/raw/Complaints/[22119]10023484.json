        "summary": "WE BOUGHT A USED CHEVROLET CAVALIER FROM THE YEAR 2000 WITH AN EXTENDED WARRANTY (GM CERTIFIED) FOR 3 MONTHS OR 3,000 MILES.  SINCE THE BEGINNING THERE WERE 4 PROBLEMS NOT YET FIXED.  1 - THERE IS A POPPING NOISE UNDER THE BACK OF THE CAR. DEALER (KOONS CHEVROLET - WITHE MARSCH, MD) SAID HE COULDN'T DUPLICATE. AFTER BRINGING THE CAR FOR THE 3RD TIME, HE SAID THE BRAKES WERE DIRTY AND HE CLEANED THEM, BUT THIS NOISE IS STILL HERE, WHEN STARTING AT A RED TRAFFIC LIGHT FOR EXAMPLE, OR WHEN RIDING ON A ROUGH ROAD.  2 - THERE IS A GRINDING NOISE IN FRONT WHEN DRIVING. IT'S STOPPING WHEN PUSHING THE BRAKE PEDAL. IT'S LINKED WITH THE BRAKES FOR SURE. THE PADS ARE NEW AND THE DEALER SAID THE ROTOR MAKES HIS NOISE, BUT HE REFUSED TO CHANGE IT (WHEREAS IT'S UNDER WARRANTY). HE SAID IT'S NOT UNSAFE. BUT THIS NOISE IS COMING LOUDER AND I FEEL LIKE A LOSS OF CONTROL.  3 - THE ABS LIGHT COME ON EVERY SINGLE DAY WHILE DRIVING AND NOT BRAKING. THE 1ST TIME, THE DEALER CHANGED THE BULB. THE 2ND TIME PROBLEM WAS NOT SOLVE) HE CHANGED THE ALTERNATOR, BECAUSE MY CAR BROKE DOWN THE DAY BEFORE (NO MORE POWER AT ALL). HE SAID THE ALTERNATOR PUTTED A LOW VOLTAGE TO THE ABS CAUSING THE LIGHT TO TURN ON. THE PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVE. AND I NEED TO GO BACK TO THE DEALER.    ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS HAVE NOT BEEN SOLVED, AND THIS IS THE 5TH TIME I AM GOING TO THE DEALER. I THINK HE'S PLAYING WITH ME, SO THAT MY CAR WON'T BE UNDER WARRANTY ANY MORE, AND I WOULD PAY TO CHANGE STUFFS IN THE FUTURE.  PLEASE PROVIDE INFORMATION AND SUPPORT.    THANK YOU.    *NLM",
