I HIT A POTHOLE WITH MY PASSENGER SIDE FRONT TIRE AT ABOUT THE EXACT TIME I DEPRESSED BY BRAKE PEDAL.  THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT DOWN ALMOST TO FLOOR AND I HAD NO BRAKING WHATSOEVER.  I STOPPED BY REAR-ENDING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.  I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES AND HAD HAD THEM INSPECTED WITH THE 30,000-MILE SERVICE A COUPLE OF DAYS EARLIER.  SEEMS LIKE IT MAY HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH HITTING THE POTHOLE.",
