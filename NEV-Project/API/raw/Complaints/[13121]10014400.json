THIS HAS HAPPENED THREE TIMES ON THE PASSENGER SIDE AND ONCE ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE.  I COULD UNDERSTAND EVEN TWO EVENTS, ONCE ON EACH SIDE.  FOUR TIMES IS TOO MANY.  I USUALLY DRIVE ALONE, MOST OF THE TIME ONLY TO AND FROM WORK.  HOWEVER, HAVING HEADLIGHTS THAT ARE NOT DEPENDABLE IS NOT A COMFORT TO ME.  MY MECHANIC SAID THE SUPPLIER TOLD HIM HE HAD \"LOTS OF THIS PARTICULAR PART\".  THIS TELLS ME THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE, I JUST MAY BE THE ONLY ONE COMPLAINING.  HOWEVER, IF THIS WERE YOUR DAUGHTER WOULD YOU WANT HER DRIVING A CAR THAT HAS NO DEPENDABLE HEADLIGHTS. *JB",
