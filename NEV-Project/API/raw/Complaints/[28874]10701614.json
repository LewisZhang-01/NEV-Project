IT LUNGES, JOLTS, DOESN'T ENGAGE AND SOMETIMES THE TRANSMISSION SLAMS INTO GEAR SO HAD THAT IT FEELS LIKE I JUST GOT REAR ENDED WITH A BIG BANG! FORD DOES NOT TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM WITH THE 06' EXPLORER DESPITE HUNDREDS UPON HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS REGARDING IT AS A SAFETY ISSUE. IT IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE! I WAS ALMOST HIT BY ONCOMING TRAFFIC WHEN I TRIED TO CROSS AN INTERSECTION AN THE TRANSMISSION WOULDN'T ENGAGE. AT VARIOUS TIMES MY VEHICLE WOULDN'T ENGAGE WHEN I WAS STOPPED AT AN INTERSECTION OR WHEN IT DID ENGAGE IT WOULD JERK. ANOTHER TIME I SLOWED AT A YIELD AND WHEN I PRESSED THE GAS THE VEHICLE WOULDN'T MOVE BUT WHEN I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE GAS IT ACCELERATED VERY QUICKLY WITH  JERKING MOTION.  *TR",
