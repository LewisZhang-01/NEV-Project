THESE CRACKS ARE A SAFETY CONCERN TO ME AS I BELIEVE IN THE CASE OF AN ACCIDENT THE AIRBAG WILL DEPLOY THROUGH THE WEAKEST LINK, I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS COULD REDUCE THE RESISTANCE OF THE AIRBAG WHEN IT DEPLOYS, THEREFORE INCREASING THE FORCE WITH WHICH IT DEPLOYS INTO THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT. I PAID FOR A CAR THAT I COULD TRUST AND A COMPANY THAT I HAD FAITH IN. THIS SHOULD BE REPAIRED AS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT. THE DEALER WANTS $2000 TO REPLACE DASH.",
