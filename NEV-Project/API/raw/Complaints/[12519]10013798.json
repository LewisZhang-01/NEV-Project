        "summary": "I HAD MY VAN FOR 1 YEAR. RECENTLY,  THE INNER TIE ROD ON THE DRIVERS SIDE HAD TO BE REPLACED, BECAUSE IT WAS ALREADY WORN OUT WITH JUST 56,000 MILES ON IT. I HAD THIS DONE BECAUSE THE VANS STEERING HAD A LEAN TO IT.  IT WOULD FEEL LIKE THE LEFT TIRE WAS LEANING WHEN I WOULD GO THROUGH A TURN. AT NORMAL SPEEDS, I HAVE EVEN HAD THE VAN LURCH TO THE RIGHT ABOUT 3 FEET WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN ON A CURVE. I AM PUTTING IT BACK IN THE SHOP, BECAUSE MY MECHANIC CAN'T FIND THE PROBLEM. WE LOOKED TODAY(04-01-03) AND WHEN YOU TURN THE WHEEL, THE ENTIRE RACK WILL MOVE. IT MOVES BEFORE THE TIRES EVEN MOVE. A DEFINITE SAFETY ISSUE TO SAY THE LEAST. DEFINITELY NOT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM A $27,000 DOLLAR VAN WITH MOSTLY HIGHWAY MILES ON IT.  *JB",
