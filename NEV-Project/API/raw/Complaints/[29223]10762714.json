AS THROTTLE IS REAPPLIED SAME    ACTION IS REPEATED. SO FAR IT HAS ONLY OCCURRED AT SPEEDS< 35 MPH. SHOULD IT OCCUR IN SLIPPERY ROAD CONDITIONS IT MOST LIKELY RESULT IN LOSS OF CONTROL.IN RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET, IT SEEMS TO BE OR IS BECOMING A MORE COMMON OCCURENCE WHICH FCA IS NOT ADDRESSING. IF YOU READ THE OTHER COMPLAINT OF THE SAME PROBLEM IT DATES BACK A FEW YEARS, YET THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANYTHING DONE TO CORRECT IT. SOME COMPLAINANTS SAY THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO HAVE IT CORRECTED EVEN AT JEEP DEALERSHIPS, OTHERS REPORT IT'S SOMETHING CALLED THE CLOCK SPRING THAT IS CAUSING THE PROBLEM AND THE PARTS TO REPAIR IT AREN'T AVAILABLE. HAVING JUST RECENTLY HAD FCA'S GAS TANK SOLUTION CORRECTED, I HOPE A FIX FOR THIS WON'T TAKE AS LONG. I NEGLECTED TO SAY THIS WAS NOT A ONE-TIME EVENT IN AS MUCH AS IT HAPPENS NOW ON AN ALMOST DAILY BASIS. A LOCAL SHOP CHECKED FOR FAULT CODES BUT THERE WERE NONE IN MEMORY; I HAVE IT SCHEDULED FOR FURTHER TESTS 09/16/2015.",
