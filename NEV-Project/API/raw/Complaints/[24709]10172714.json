DEALERSHIP SAID THE DIESEL FUEL TRANSFER PUMP WENT BAD WHICH THEY SAID WAS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM. SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAID IT WAS A DESIGN FLAW AND HAVE TO PUT A KIT ON IT TO FIX THE PROBLEM (TOTALLY RELOCATE THE FUEL TRANSFER PUMP FROM THE ENGINE TO THE FUEL TANK). ALSO SAID IT WAS A POSSIBILITY THAT IT RUINED THE INJECTOR PUMP BECAUSE IT WAS NOT RECEIVING FUEL FROM THE TRANSFER PUMP.  THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM AND SERVICE DEPARTMENTS ADMIT IT AND IS WIDELY DOCUMENTED ON THE INTERNET, WHY HAS A RECALL NOT BEEN ISSUED.*JB",
