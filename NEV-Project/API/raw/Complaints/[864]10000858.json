AFTER LEAVING IT SIT FOR ABOUT A HOUR IT RESTARTED. I DID SOME CHECKING ON THE INTERNET AND READ ABOUT THE SAME THING HAPPENIG TO OTHER PEOPLE WITH LEAKING MANIFOLD GASKETS.I CALLED GM ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND THEY SAID THEY NEVER HEARD OF ANY PROBLEMS LIKE THIS. THE OLDSMOBILE GARAGE THAT TOLD ME WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS SAID THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME, THAT THE GASKETS ARE DEFECTIVE. MY CONCERN IS THAT IF THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN PEOPLE OR CARS NEAR ME WHEN THIS HAPPENED THIS COULD HAVE BEEN DEADLY. FOR GM TO SIT AND LIE TO ME THAT THERES NOTHING WRONG AND THEN I SEE PETITIONS WITH AROND 1350 PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET, SOMETHING HAD BETTER BE DONE.I THINK A RECALL SHOULD BE DONE.",
