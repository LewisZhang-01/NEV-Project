        "summary": "I DISCOVERED TWO GAPS IN THE REAR SEALS ON THE LIFT GATE OF MY 2000 GMC YUKON XL.  THE GAPS ARE AT THE BOTTOM CORNERS OF THE LIFT GATE (RIGHT AND LEFT SIDES) AND ARE APPROXIMATELY 1 TO 3 INCHES LONG AND ABOUT 1/16\" WIDE.  THESE GAPS WILL ALLOW EXHAUST GASSES TO COME INTO THE VEHICLE, OR WATER IN THE EVENT OF A HEAVY RAINSTORM. WE PLAN TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO THE NEAREST DEALER VERY SOON, AS WE HAVE 35,990 MILES ON IT AND WE WANT IT FIXED UNDER WARRANTY.  THE SEALS APPEAR TO BE INADEQUATE, I.E. INSUFFICIENT IN SIZE OR THICKNESS TO ADEQUATELY SEAL THE BOTTOM CORNERS OF THE LIFT GATE.  THIS PROBLEM WAS FOUND BY INSPECTION BY MYSELF, AS I WAS INSPECTING THE VEHICLE PRIOR TO ALLOWING THE WARRANTY TO EXPIRE.  FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABLE TO SEE LIGHT COMING THROUGH EACH CORNER, BEFORE ANYONE HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE GAP IN THE SEALS.",
