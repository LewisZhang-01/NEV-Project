I TOOK THE CAR IN TO A MECHANIC AND THEY HAD TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION FOR $2,500.  HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM WAS NOT FIXED.  IT IS STILL DOING THE SAME THING AND THE MECHANICS, AFTER 2 WEEKS, STILL CAN NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE.  THIS CAR ONLY HAD 45,000 MILES.  I WISH I HAD CHECKED THIS WEBSITE BEFORE I BOUGHT THE CAR AND SAW ALL THE TRANSMISSION COMPLAINTS.  I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER MAZDA.    *NLM",
