THEN I WAS COMING OUT OF WORK FROM WORKING A LONG NIGHT SHIFT AND WENT TO TURN MY CAR ON BUT IT WOULD NOT TURN ON. I HAVE READ UP ON THE THEFT SYSTEM LIGHT AND ACCORDING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THIS PROBLEM IS QUITE FREQUENT AND NOTHING IS BEING DONE ABOUT IT. I AM A SINGLE MOTHER OF 3 KIDS AND I NEED MY VEHICLE TO WORK. I READ THAT IT WILL HAPPEN A LOT AND THE GM PEOPLE KNOW OF THIS AND THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY SAY THERE'S NOT ENOUGH COMPLAINTS. I WANT THIS PROBLEM FIXED BUT I DON'T HAVE THE EXTRA MONEY TO DO IT SO IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF THIS PROBLEM WAS RECALLED SO MY CAR CAN BE FIXED FROM THIS ANNOYING ISSUE. I AM AFRAID THAT IF I GET IT TO START I'M GOING TO END UP SOMEWHERE STRANDED WITH MY KIDS. PLEASE I HOPE SOMETHING IS DONE ABOUT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I HAVE READ IT HAPPENS TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO OWN CHEVY MALIBUS FROM THE YEAR 1997-2005. I HOPE THIS HELPS TO GET THIS PROBLEM RESOLVED FOR ME AND EVERYONE ELSE WHO OWNS THIS VEHICLE.  *TR",
