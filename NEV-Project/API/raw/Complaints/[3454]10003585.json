I HAVE HAD 2 TIMING CHAINS REPLACED AND BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER AT LEAST 8 TIMES CONCERING THIS PROBLEM. THE MANAGER OF THE NISSAN REPAIR DEPARTMENT IN MISSOULA FINALLY TOULD ME THAT EVERY 1997 NISSAN PU THAT HE HAD EVER SEEN HAS THE SAME PROBLEM BUT HE DID NOT INFORM ME OF A RECALL OF THE TRUCK. HE TOULD ME THAT THE ENGINE DESIGN DOES NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT OIL PRESSURE TO THE TIMING CHAIN ASSEMBLY WHEN THE VEHICLE IS FIRST STARTED. THIS SEEMS TO LEAD TO ECCESSIVE WEAR TO THE TIMING CHAIN ASSEMBLY CAUSING PREMATURE FAILURE. MY TRUCK IS NOW OUT OF WARRANTY WITH 60000 MILES ON IT AND THE TIMING CHAIN RATTLE IS GETTING LOUDER AND LOUDER. HAS THERE BEEN A RECALL OF THIS VEHICLE?  THANKS  RICHARD HARRISON",
