IT IS EXACTLY AS EVERYONE ELSE HAS NOTED, THE JEEP FELT LIKE ALL 4 WHEELS WERE COMING OFF, THE JEEP SHOOK VOILENTLY, WAS EXTREMELY HARD TO HANDLE.  I SLOWED MY SPEED AND PULLED OFF THE ROAD.  THE CAR FELT LIKE IT WAS GOING TO COME APART.  THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM TO CHRYSLER AND TO THIS ORGANIZATION, WHY WON'T YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT?????  WITH ONLY 33K MILES, I NOW HAVE TO GET A NEW CAR BECAUSE I AM IN FEAR OF DRIVING THIS ONE.  IF THIS HAD HAPPENED IN THE MIDDLE LANE OF AN EXPRESSWAY....IT COULD HAVE BEEN TRAGIC AND DEADLY....IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE WAITING FOR? HOPE IT ISN'T ANYONE YOU KNOW WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN!",
