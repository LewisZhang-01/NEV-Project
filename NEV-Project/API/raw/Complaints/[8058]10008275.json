ENGINE PERFORMANCE WAS NOT EFFECTED  UNTIL AROUND 65,000 MILES, WHEN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STARTED COMING ON INTERMITTENTLY AND THE ENGINE WOULD DIE. I TOOK IT TO A KNOWLEDGEABLE AND HONEST MECHANIC WHO THROUGH THE COURSE OF TROUBLE SHOOTING THE NOISE DISCOVERED THE TIMING BELT WAS LOOSE AND HAD DAMAGED MANY INTERNAL ENGINE PARTS. HE SAYS THE CHAIN IS PULLING DOUBLE DUTY, WITH A GEAR ON THE INSIDE AS WELL AS THE OUTSIDE OF THE CHAIN.  THE INCREASED WEAR CAUSED IT TO STRETCH AND IT BEGAN SLAPPING/RUBBING AND DAMAGING OTHER PARTS. NAMELY VARIOUS SPOTS ON THE CASE AND THE WATER PUMP, WHICH WAS WORN NEARLY ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND SEEPING WATER AND COOLANT INTO THE ENGINE. HE SAYS THIS IS A SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW AND THAT HE HAS HEARD A LOT OF OTHER INTREPID'S ARE REQUIRING NEW ENGINES FOR THIS SAME REASON. I AM HOPING THAT SOMETHING CAN BE DONE TO FORCE CHRYSLER TO BUY NEW ENGINES FOR THOSE OF US WHO HAVE TAKEN CARE OF OUR CARS AND STILL HAVE TO SUFFER THIS GREAT COST. THESE MAY NOT BE THE ONLY PROBLEMS CAUSED BY THIS FLAW, BUT SO FAR I THINK IT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH TO WARRANT A COMPLAINT.",
