( 1ST TIME TO BE FILED ON ANOTHER COMPLAINT FORM )  I KNOW OF A NUMBER OF OTHER P 30 OWNERS WHO HAS EXPERIENCE AUTO PARK BRAKES PROBLEMS AND ARE VERY UNHAPPY WITH GENERAL MOTORS BECAUSE THEY DON\"T SEEM TO CARE ABOUT OUR SAFETY OR COST. HOPE YOU WILL REVIEW ALL COMPLAINTS AND CONSIDER OUR REQUEST. THANK YOU.",
