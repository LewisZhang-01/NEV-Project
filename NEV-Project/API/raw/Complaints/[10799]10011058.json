THE PROBLEM WAS, THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY IN THE ACCIDENT LIKE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO. THE TYPE OF VEHICLE WAS A 2001 MITSUBISHI GALANT ES. I WAS GOING APPROXIMATELY 45 MILES PER HOUR. THE SHUTTLE BUS THAT HIT ME PULLED OUT IN FRONT OF ME AND WE COLLIDED. I AM REALLY UPSET  BUT THANK GOD I HAD MY SEAT BELT ON. I TRIED CONTACTING THE MITSUBISHI COMPANY BUT THEY DECLINED TO SPEAK TO ME AND GAVE THE RUN AROUND. IF THERE IS ANYWAY I CAN GET HELP WITH THIS MATTER I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THANKS .
