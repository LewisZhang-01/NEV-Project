SINCE TAKING OWNERSHIP IT HAS BECOME EXTREMELY CLEAR TO ME THAT THE STEERING QUALITY OF THE VEHICLE IS EXTREMELY POOR.  THE TRUCK WANDERS ALL OVER THE ROAD AND REQUIRES AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF CORRECTIONS.  I HAVE HAD NEW TIRES PUT ON AND AN ALIGNMENT DONE.  THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS.  I HAVE LET OTHERS TEST DRIVE THE VEHICLE AND THEY ALL ASK WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE STEERING.",
