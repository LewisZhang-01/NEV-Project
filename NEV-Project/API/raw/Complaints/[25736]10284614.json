TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT COMES ON, POWER STEERING GOES OUT, TRANSMISSION SHIFTS HARD, CLICKING NOISE IN GEAR SHIFTER, GAUGES FOR SPEED AND RPMS BOUNCE AROUND, LIGHTS FOR E-BRAKE AND ABS FLASH, AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON. THIS CAN OCCUR AT ANY TIME. SOMETIMES IT IS AS SOON AS YOU START THE CAR. OTHER TIMES IT IS WHILE I AM DRIVING. CAN NOT PREDICT WHEN IT IS COMING. SURPRISINGLY I HAVE NOT GOT INJURED DRIVING. I HAVE LEARNED TO MUSCLE THE CAR WHEN THE STEERING GOES OUT. I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR BUT HAVE NO CHOICE SOMETIMES. IT IS THE ONLY CAR MY FAMILY FITS INTO. I FEEL I AM PUTTING US ALL AT RISK EVERY TIME WE GET IN IT. I HAVE TAKEN IT IN SEVERAL TIMES, THE FIRST COUPLE TIMES THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. I GOT IT TO THE DEALER WHEN THE PROBLEM WAS HAPPENING. THE ONLY THING THEY COULD FIND WAS TO REPLACE A RECALLED TRANSMISSION VALVE. IT DID NOTHING FOR THE PROBLEM. IT STILL HAPPENS WHEN EVER AND STOPS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME. YOU DO HAVE TO TURN THE CAR OFF. IT CAN TAKE ONE TIME OR SEVERAL TIMES TURNING THE CAR ON AND OFF. NO ONE CAN SEEM TO GIVE ME ANY ANSWERS. I REALLY FEEL THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE SOLVED. I BOUGHT THE CAR IN 2005. FIRST INCIDENT IN FALL OF 2007. REPLACED VALVE IN SPRING OF 2009. *TR",
