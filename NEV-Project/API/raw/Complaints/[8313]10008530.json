YOU  MUST FIRST UNLOCK THE REAR DOOR MANUALLY (FOR WITH THE POWER LOCKS), THEN OPEN THE DOOR WITH THE INSIDE DOOR HANDLE. I FEEL THAT THIS CONDITION IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IF THERE IS AN INSTANCE WHERE SOMEONE IS RIDING IN THE REAR SEAT AND THE PERSON MUST EXIT THE VEHICLE IN A HURRY, THEY MAY BECOME DISORIENTED AND FORGET TO FIRST UNLOCK THE REAR DOOR MANUALLY. THEY WILL GET PANICKY THEN UNTIL THEY REALIZE, IF THEY DO, WHAT IS HAPPENING. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN THE CASE OF OLDER CHILDREN WHO ARE OLD ENOUGH TO OPERATE A CAR DOOR BY THEMSELVES.**** DIMS 11 IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****769311.  *AK     *JB",
