        "summary": "AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS TURN ON IN DAYLIGHT - CAN'T SEE DASH.  IN THE MORNING AND EVENING WHEN THE SUN IS LOW AND IN YOUR EYES, I WEAR SUNGLASSES LIKE MOST DRIVERS.  THE AUTOMATIC LIGHTS COME ON AND DIM THE DASH MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE.  YOU CAN FIDDLE WITH THE DASH INTENSITY AND READ IT AGAIN, BUT IT IS ANNOYING TO DO THIS ALL THE TIME.  THE RADIO STAYS DIM AND IS UNADJUSTABLE BY THE DASH INTENSITY LIGHTS, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE.  YOU HAVE TO MOVE YOUR HEAD TO FUNNY ANGLES OR REMOVE YOUR SUNGLASSES TO SEE THE RADIO.  I FEEL FIDDLING WITH THE DASH LIGHTS AND/OR REMOVING YOUR SUNGLASSES TO OPERATE THE RADIO ARE DISTRACTIONS TO THE DRIVER AND INCREASE RISK OF ACCIDENT.  THE DASH LIGHTING ON THE VIBES IS CRITICAL AS IT IS BECAUSE THE DASH LIGHTS MUST STAY ON ALL THE TIME.  THIS IS BECAUSE THEY ARE IN A TUNNEL AND YOU CAN NOT SEE THEM, EVEN IN BRIGHT LIGHT, WITHOUT THE DASH LIGHTS ON.  COUPLE IN THE FACT THAT PONTIAC USES RED BACKLIGHTING FOR THE DASHBOARD AND THE DASH GAGES ARE ALREADY AT A SIGHT DISADVANTAGE.  THROW IN A TOUCHY LIGHT SENSOR THAT TURNS ON YOUR HEADLIGHTS (AND DIMS THE DASH) AND IT IS NOT A GOOD SITUATION.  THE SENSOR IS TOO SENSITIVE AND I NOTICED COMPLAINTS ON FORUMS SUCH AS GENVIBE.COM AND MATRIX-VIBE.NET THAT MAKE MENTION OF THE SAME PROBLEM.  SENSOR SHOULD BE DISACTIVATED OR REPLACED WITH LESS SENSITIVE TYPE.  I HAVE A 2000 PONTIAC  MONTANNA WITH AUTOMATIC LIGHTS AND IT WORKS FLAWLESS.  ONLY COMES ON AT DUSK.  NEVER COMES ON WITH A LOW SUN (DAWN, DUSK) SHINNING IN YOUR EYES.   PLEASE NOTE THAT MY LIGHT SENSOR IN MY VIBE IS IN THE UPPER LEFT CORNER OF DASH AND IT IS NOT BLOCKED IN ANY MANNER.  THIS LOCATION SEEMS STUPID FOR A LIGHT SENSOR ALSO, AS SHADOWS FROM THE A-PILLAR MAKE IT COME IN OF THE SUN IS BLOCKED FROM THE A-PILLAR.    KEITH NELSON",
