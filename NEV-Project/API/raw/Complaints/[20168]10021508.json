THE TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED.  THE SECOND TIME, I WAS DRIVING AND THE ENGINE STARTED MISSING, THEN JUST DIED.  NO STEERING, NOTHING.  IT WAS TOWED TO THE SHOP AGAIN TO HAVE THE TRANSMISSION RECHECKED.  GOT THE YUKON BACK AFTER A MONTH, DROVE IT HOME (ABOUT 90 MILES)...IT WAS FINE.  THEN THE SECOND DAY AFTER GETTING IT BACK, IT AGAIN STARTED JERKING, MISSING, AND THEN DIED.  I WAS ON A HILL IN TOWN WHEN IT STOPPED.  MY YUKON STARTED ROLLING  BACKWARDS, AND I HAD TO FORCE THE WHEEL TO SHARPLY STEER IT INTO A PARKING LOT.  I ALMOST HIT SEVERAL CARS THAT DIDN'T KNOW THE VEHICLE HAD LOST POWER.  IT HAS ONCE AGAIN BEEN TOWED TO THE SHOP.  WHAT IS CAUSING IT TO SUDDENLY MISS THEN DIE?  *JB",
