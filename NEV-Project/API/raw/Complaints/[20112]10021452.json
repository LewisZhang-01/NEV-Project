        "summary": "THE AIR BAG LIGHT COMES ON AND A BELL CHIMES WHILE DRIVING. AFTER A SHORT INTERVAL THE LIGHT WILL GO OFF ONLY TO COME BACK ON LATER. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT CHRYSLER IN MILFORD, PA SAID IT CAN NOT BE CHECKED OUT UNLESS IT REMAINS ON TO BE CHECKED FOR A COMPUTER READ OUT. THE SERVICE ATTENDANT INFORMED ME THAT THE AIR BAG WOULD NOT DISCHARGE WHEN THE LIGHT IS ON AND I SHOULD HOPE I AM NOT IN AN ACCIDENT DURING THIS MOMENT. THIS PUTS THE DRIVER AND THE PASSENGER AT RISK DURING THE TIME THE AIRBAG IS NOT WORKING. A CUSTOMER FOLLOWING ME HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND RECEIVED THE SAME ANSWER. THIS IS A SAFETY PROBLEM AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO INVESTIGATE AND FIND  A POSSIBLE SOLUTION. THANK YOU.   *JB",
