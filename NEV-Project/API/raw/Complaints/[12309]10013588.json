        "summary": "2001 ACURA CL, 32000 MILES,5 SPEED AUTO TRANS.  WHILE DRIVING IN HEAVY TRAFFIC AT 45 MPH, THE TRANSMISSION VIOLENTLY AND ERRATICALLY SHIFTED FROM 5TH SPEED INTO 1ST OR 2ND AND BACK INTO 5TH.  THIS UNEXPECTED SHIFTING CAUSED THE CAR TO RAPIDLY SLOW DOWN, THEN ACCELERATE. I TURNED OFF THE HIGHWAY ONTO A LESS CROWDED STREET AND CONTINUED DRIVING TOWARDS MY DESTINATION.  THE PROBLEM RECURRED 5 OR 6 TIMES IN THE NEXT 3 MILES.  PREVIOUSLY, THE ONLY INDICATION OF TRANSMISSION TROUBLE WAS EARLIER THAT DAY. THERE WAS SOME SLIPPAGE WHEN SHIFTING BETWEEN 2ND AND 3RD SPEED.  THE ACURA DEALER EXAMINED THE CAR AND TOLD ME I NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION.  ACURA INFORMED OWNERS BY LETTER THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH SOME TRANSMISSIONS AND EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON THEM, BUT I HAD NO IDEA OF WHAT TO EXPECT.  THIS WAS A FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE!  IT IS FORTUNATE THAT I HAD MY SEAT BELTS ON AS THE SUDDEN LURCHING WOULD HAVE THROWN ME AGAINST THE STEERING WHEEL WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE.  I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THESE CARS TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSIONS.  *JB",
