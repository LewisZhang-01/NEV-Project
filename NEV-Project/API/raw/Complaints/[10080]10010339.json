THE INCORRECTLY ROUTED HARNESS STRAPS ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO TIGHTEN AROUND THE CHILD.  BASED ON DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER MARATHON OWNERS, IT APPEARS THAT THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST FEW MONTHS AFTER THEY FIRST BEGAN SELLING THIS SEAT.  I HAVE TWO MARATHONS.  ONE MANUFACTURED IN AUGUST 2002 (WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT), AND ONE MANUFACTURED IN JANUARY 2003.  THE NEWER SEAT IS FINE AND CAN BE TIGHTENED EASILY.  THE AUGUST SEAT HAS THE FLAW AND I NO LONGER USE IT.  WHEN I CALLED BRITAX, THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE STRAP HAS BEEN THREADED TWO DIFFERENT WAYS, BUT SAID BOTH WAYS HAVE BEEN TESTED AND ARE SAFE.  IN REALITY, IT IS ONLY SAFE IF YOU ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL THE STRAPS TIGHT.  IT ALSO APPEARS TO ME THAT THE IMPROPERLY ROUTED STRAP RUBS ALONG A SHARP PLASTIC PART.  *JB",
