        "summary": "THIS PROBLEM OF THE ABS SYSTEM MALFUNCTIONING STARTED A LITTLE OVER  A YEAR AGO.  I HAVE ALREADY SPENT WELL OVER 800 DOLLARS ON BRAKE WORK AT SEVERAL DIFFERENT BRAKE SHOPS.  NOBODY KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS UNTIL I TOOK IT TO THE LAST PLACE.  THEY TOLD ME IT WAS 1300 DOLLAR PROBLEM.  I NEED TO REPLACE THE ABS BOX.  WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY ONE DAY IN PERFECTLY CLEAR WEATHER I WAS TO FORCE TO HIT MY BRAKES AND ENDED UP SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL AND ALMOST BEING STRUCK BY NUMEROUS CARS UNTIL I FINALLY COME TO A STOP FACING TRAFFIC.  THIS HAPPENED WHILE MY 15 MONTH OLD SON WAS IN THE CAR WITH ME.  I HAVE READ IN NUMEROUS DIFFERENT WEB SITES ALL THE COMPLAINTS OF THE ABS SYSTEM FAILING ON 94 CAVALIERS.  I THINK IF ANYTHING IS DECIDED TO BE RECALLED THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THEM.  NOT EVERYONE HAS THE MONEY TO JUST THROW AWAY ON HAVING THE PROBLEM FIXED. TS",
