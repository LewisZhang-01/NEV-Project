        "summary": "MY CAR WHICH WAS PURCHASED BRAND NEW IN JULY 2001 HAS BEEN TO THE REPAIR SHOP 13 TIMES. I PURCHASED A 2001 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA. THE ONGOING PROBLEM IS THAT THE CAR IS LOSING POWER WHILE ACCELERATING. VOLKSWAGEN DOESN'T WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEFECT OF THEIR OWN PRODUCT. I WAS TOLD TWO THINGS WHICH DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME. FIRST, I WAS TOLD MY ENGINE IS NOT APART OF THE RECALL FOR THOSE OTHER VW CARS THAT ARE LOSING POWER.  SECOND, A VW REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME IT WAS MY EXTRA CAR MATS THAT IS PROBABLY CAUSING THE PROBLEM. I THINK VOLKSWAGEN IS JUST IGNORING THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM. IF MY CAR SLOWS DOWN ON ME WHENEVER IT WANTS AND I DIE AS A RESULT OF THEIR DEFECT PRODUCT THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO RECOGNIZE, IT IS TRULY GOING TO BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM. THE CAR HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE ENGINE, AIRBAGS, MALFUNCTIONED SENSOR, CLOCK SPRING, HARNESS, AND NOW IT IS LOSING POWER. ALTHOUGH THIS CAR HAS HAD NUMEROUS PROBLEMS, THIS IS THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT I WOULD LIKE O BE RECTIFIED. VOLKSWAGEN SERVICE DEPARTMENT CHANGED THE COMPUTER AND TOLD ME THIS WILL DEFINITELY SOLVE THE PROBLEM. OBVIOUSLY IT DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. SINCE THE COMPUTER WAS CHANGED IN SEPT. 2002 THE CAR LOST POWER 3 TIMES SINCE THEN.*JB",
