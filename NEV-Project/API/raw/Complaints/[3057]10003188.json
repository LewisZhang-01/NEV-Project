        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 2002 AUDI A6 AS OUR \"FAMILY CAR.\" DURING THE PURCHASE PROCESS I INQUIRED ABOUT THE SAFETY REGULATIONS IN REGARDS TO THE SIDE AIRBAGS (REAR SEAT) AND CHILD SAFETY SEATS. I WAS TOLD THAT AS LONG AS THEY WERE POSTIONED PROPERLY THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER TO A CHILD IN A PROPERLY INSTALLED SEAT. NOT LONG AFTER RECIEVING THE VEHICLE, WE FOUND OUT THE \"FAMILY\" WAS IMMINENT. DURING MY RESEARCH INTO WHAT CHILD SAFETY SEAT TO PURCHASE, I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THAT THE DEALERSHIP PROVIDED ME WITH INACCURATE INFORMATION. I ALSO FOUND OUT THAT YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO PLACE A REAR-FACING CAR SEAT IN FRONT OF A FOLD DOWN ARM REST. THIS BASICALLY RULED OUT MY ENTIRE BACK SEAT!! I BEGAN TO WORK WITH AUDI TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I HAVE SPOKEN WITH THE GENERAL MANAGER, SERVICE MANAGER AND ANYONE WHO WOULD LISTEN. I REALIZED JUST HOW IGNORANT THEY ARE ON THE SUBJECT AND THAT I WAS SOLD THIS VEHICLE (WITH THE UPGRADES/AIRBAGS) UNDER FALSE PRETENSES AND INACCURATE INFO FROM THOSE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO KNOW THEIR CARS. I HAVE WORKED WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT AUTHORIZED TO CHECK THE INSTALLATION OF CAR SEATS AND WE HAVE FOUND A SOLUTION. BUT I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THE FACT I MUST \"FIND A SOLUTION\" TO A PROBLEM THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER OCCURED. OF COURSE AUDI WILL DO ANYTHING I AM WILLING TO PAY FOR, YET I DON'T FEEL I SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR THEIR INACCURATE INFORMATION. THEY WILL NOT DISABLE MY REAR AIRBAGS EITHER! WHAT COURSE OF ACTION DO YOU RECOMMEND? IS THERE A WAY TO HAVE THEM DISABLE MY AIRBAGS? IS THERE SOME WAY THAT I CAN MAKE AUDI TAKE RESPONSIBILTY FOR THE KNOWLEDGE, OR LACK THERE OF WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES?",
