        "summary": "ABOUT A YEAR BACK I HAD TRANSMISSION PROBLEM ON MY SABLE AT 70,000 MILES. IT WOULD MOVE IN REVERSE BUT NO FORWARD MOTION. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED AND THE TRANSMISSION WAS REBUILT AT COTTMAN TRANSMISSION AT THE COST OF OVER $2000 AND LOSS OF VEHICLE USE FOR A WEEK. A MONTH LATER, IT FAILED WITH EXACTLY SIMILAR SYMPTOMS. IT WAS TOWED TO THE SAME FACILITY AND REPAIRED UNDER WARRANTY IN FOUR DAYS. SIX MONTHS   LATER, AND EXACTLY A MONTH AFTER THE WARRANTY ON REPAIR WORK EXPIRED (74,000 MILES), THE TRANSMISSION STARTED TO VISIBLY DOWN SHIFT WHILE DRIVING (AT ALL SPEEDS). TOOK IT BACK TO REPAIR FACILITY - WAS TOLD IT'S INTERNAL TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS - ONCE AGAIN! I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. I CAN'T AFFORD TO WASTE 4,000 ON TRANSMISSION JOBS ON THIS CAR WHEN IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH THAT MUCH. I SCANNED THROUGH THE OTHER COMPLAINTS AND FOUND SOME OTHER INSTANCES WHEN THIS TRANSMISSION HAD GIVEN PROBLEMS TO OWNERS. JUST WONDERING HOW MANY DISSATISFIED OWNERS WOULD IT TAKE FOR FORD TO REALIZE THAT THERE IS A \"REAL\" PROBLEM WITH THEIR SABLE/MERCURY TRANSMISSIONS! I HAD TWO FORD TAURUS'S IN THE PAST, AND THIS IS THIRD FROM FORD FAMILY. I AM GOING TO STOP SPENDING MONEY ON FORD CARS IF THIS IS THE LEVEL OF QUALITY THAT I GET FOR MY MONEY.",
