APPARENTLY AFTER RESEARCH IT IS NOTED NISSAN IS AWARE OF THE ELECTRONIC STEERING LOCK PROBLEM. IF THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES WHY NOT RECALL THE PART INSTEAD OF LEAVING MOTORIST STRANDED. IF THE PART MALFUNCTIONS THERE IS NO WAY TO MOVE THE CAR. I'M NOT SURE WHERE IT IS OK TO CHARGE 1200 DOLLARS KNOWING YOUR PART IS DEFECTIVE. THIS PROBLEM HAS LEFT ME STRANDED 3 DIFFERENT TIMES.  *TR",
