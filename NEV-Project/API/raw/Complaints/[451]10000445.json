IT BEGAN TO JERK FORWARD AND I PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  WE HAD IT TOWED FROM THIS LOCATION AND WE WERE TOLD BY LONGMONT TOYOTA THAT WE NEEDED THE TRANSMISSION REPLACED.  I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE AFTER MAINTAINING THE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE AND NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAS GONE OUT AT 75000 MILES.  AT THIS TIME WE ARE CONTACTING TOYOTA FOR RESOLUTION.  I SEE THAT THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS VEHICLE AND WONDER WHY INFORMATION HAS NOT BEEN PROVIDED TO THE PUBLIC.  THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN FOR THOSE CONSUMERS WHO OWN THE 2000 TOYOTA SIENNA. TS",
