THE CAR STARTED TO OVERHEAT AND THERE WERE PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS.  AFTER TAKING IT IN I WAS TOLD THE THE INTAKE MANIFOLD NEED TO BE REPLACED AND IT WAS ON BACK ORDER.  THEY FINALLY REPLACED THE MANIFOLD AFTER TWO WEEKS.  BUT THE CAR HAS NOT PERFORMED THE SAME.  THE CAR STILL SLIGHTLY OVERHEATS AND THE DEALERSHIP MENTIONS THAT IT IS OKAY THAT THE CAR RUNS SLIGHTLY WARM.  AND AT TIME I SMELL THE COOLANT WHEN THE CAR IS RUNNING.  I FEEL THAT IF THE MANIFOLD WAS FIXED THEN THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR.  I ALSO FOUND OUT THAT ALOT OF OTHER GM VEHICLES ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THERE MANIFOLD.  I FEEL THAT AFTER THE WARNTEE IS OVER THAT THE CAR WILL HAVE PROBLEMS LATER.",
