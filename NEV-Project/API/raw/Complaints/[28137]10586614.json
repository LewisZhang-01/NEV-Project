YESTERDAY, MY CAR SUDDENLY STOPPED ACCELERATION AND MADE AN EXTREME JERK MULTIPLE TIMES ON THE FREEWAY- THIS COULD HAVE KILLED MYSELF, MY PASSENGERS AND ANYONE WHO MAY HAVE HIT ME. TODAY, I WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE MY VEHICLE HAS A SALVAGED TITLE, FORD WOULD NOT FIX THE THROTTLE BODY COMPONENT. I AM NOT COVERED FOR THEIR STUPID EXTENDED WARRANTY PROGRAM. FORD NEEDS A FULL RECALL FOR THE THROTTLE BODY, FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO ARE BEYOND WARRANTY COVERAGE. THEY ALREADY CONNED ME INTO AN UNNECESSARY $1400 REPAIR BEFORE, NOW I FEEL THAT I AM ONLY BEING CONNED AGAIN. OWN UP TO YOUR MISTAKES FORD! I'M TIRED OF HAVING MY SAFETY AT RISK BECAUSE OF YOU!  *TR",
