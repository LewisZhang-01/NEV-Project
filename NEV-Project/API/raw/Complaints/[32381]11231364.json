IF THE DRIVER ISN'T QUICK-REACTING WITH THE FOOT ALREADY ON THE BRAKE PEDAL, THE AUTO COULD MOVE QUICKLY AND CONTACT THE NEARBY AUTO OR STRUCTURE BEFORE THE BRAKE IS PRESSED STOPPING THE VEHICLE FROM LURCHING/SURGING FORWARD.  THERE IS A TSB ISSUED, BUT IT SHOULD BE A SAFETY RECALL DUE TO THE RISK OF CONTACTING ANOTHER NEARLY VEHICLE OR STRUCTURE. IT HAS STEADILY GROWN MORE FREQUENT OVER THE PAST YEAR.",
