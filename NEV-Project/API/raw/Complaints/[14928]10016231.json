AFTER A FEW TIMES OF THIS THE TRANSMISSION STARTED TO SLIP WHEN CHANGING GEARS.  I FIRST REPLACED THE FILTER AND FLUID AND NOTICED LARGE CHUNKS OF STEEL IN THE FILTER TRAY.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER, AND THEY SAID IT JUST NEED TO BE CLEANED.  IT CONTINUED, SO I THEN TOOK IT TO A TRANSMISSION SHOP AND FOUND THE PINION GEAR HAD BROKE AND THEREFORE CAUSED MY GEARS TO BE STRIPED.  COST TO ME WAS 2100.00 AND I WAS TOLD BY THE MECHANIC THEY HAVE ACTUALLY DONE TRANSMISSION WORK FOR MY CAR DEALER AND THIS WAS ONE OF SEVERAL OLDS. WITH LOW MILEAGE THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED TO. *JB",
