        "summary": "I OWN A 1999 CHEVY SIVLERADO.  ON 12/27/02 I STARTED MY VEHICLE AFTER LEAVING WORK AND NOTICED THAT THE ABS LIGHT WENT ON.  AFTER I GOT HOME AND SHUT THE TRUCK OFF THERE WAS A NOISE COMING FROM UNDER THE TRUCK (SOUNDED LIKE AN ELECTRIC MOTOR RUNNING).  I DROVE THE TRUCK OVER TO MY LOCAL CHEVY DEALERSHIP AND ONE OF THE TECH'S LISTENED TO THE TRUCK AND DIAGNOSED IT AS THE ABS MODULE.  I TOLD THE SERVICE MANAGER TO CALL ME WITH A QUOTE FOR REPAIR.  HE CALLED ABOUT AN HOUR LATER AND SAID THAT IT WAS THE ABS MODULE, AND IT WOULD COST AROUND $1000 TO REPAIR.  I DECLINED REPAIR AS I WAS TOLD THAT THE BRAKES WOULD FUNCTION FINE BY JUST PULLING THE ABS FUSE (THE ABS WOULDN'T WORK, BUT THE BRAKES WOULD WORK FINE).  TRYING TO NEGOTIATE WITH DEALER AND/OR GM ON REPAIR COST.  TRUCK HAS 60000 MILES, SO THEY ARE SAYING \"OUT OF WARRANTY\".  I SAID \"STAND BEHIND YOUR PRODUCT!\"  SAW THESE OTHER INSTANCES OF THE SAME PROBLEM ON THIS WEB SITE, SO I THOUGHT I WOULD ADD MINE.  LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE ABS ON THIS VEHICLE AND THEY ARE NOT TAKING CARE OF IT.",
