THEN SUDDENLY I COULD NOT TURN THE STEERING WHEEL EASILY, AND I REALIZED I WAS LOOSING CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. I MADE A DECISION TO MOVE OUT OF THE BUSY ROAD AND TURN INTO A SMALL STREET. THIS I DID, BUT ONLY WAS ABLE TO STOP THE CAR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET. AS THERE WERE NO CAR DRIVING ON THE STREET, I DID NOT CRASH MY CAR. AFTER THE CAR WAS STOPPED, I NOTICED THAT AN ADDITIONAL WARNING WAS ON: ELECTRIC POWERING STEERING SYSTEM WARNING LIGHT. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO TOYOTA DEALERSHIP.  *TR",
