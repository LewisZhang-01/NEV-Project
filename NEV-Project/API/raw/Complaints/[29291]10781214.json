DURING THE WEEKEND OF 25TH OF SEPTEMBER 2015 IT RAINED AND UPON TRYING TO TURN ON THE VEHICLE TO GO TO WORK ON MONDAY AS USUAL, THE MOTOR/ENGINE WAS HYDROLOCKED. WATER HAD SEEPED INTO THE CYLINDERS AND THE MOTOR  SUFFERED FAILURE AND BROKE RODS. I HAD INSTALLED THE NEWLY REDESIGNED COWL VENT GRILLE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO PREVENT THIS ,BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.  DODGE COMPANY IS VERY WELL AWARE OF THEIR BAD ENGINEERING BUT WON'T RECALL THE VEHICLES AND PROTECT THEIR CUSTOMERS.  I JUST LOST OVER 9000.00 DOLLARS IN INVESTMENT, INCLUDING TAXES FOR 700.00 + GETTING THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION,  INSPECTED,  TAGS, ETC. THE VEHICLE WASN'T IN MOTION WHEN THIS HAPPENED.  IT WAS PARKED. NOT EVEN THEIR REDESIGNED COWL VENT GRILLE PREVENTS HYDROLOCK, WATER FROM LEAKING INTO THE INTAKE MANIFOLD,  FROM HAPPENING.",
