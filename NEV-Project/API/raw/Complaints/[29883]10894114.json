        "summary": "I HAD A TIRE FAILURE WHILE MERGING ONTO THE INTERSTATE. THIS IS A TRAILER I BOUGHT USED, AND I REALIZE THAT I AM WAY OUT OF WARRANTY. MY ISSUE IS, THAT THIS UNIT HAS THE WRONG TIRE SIZE, LOAD RANGE, AND WHEEL SIZE. LOOKING AT THE DATE, I ASSUME THEY ARE ORIGINAL TIRES. THEY ARE ST205/75R15 LR C ON 15 X % INCH WHEELS. THE STICKER ON THE SIDE OF THE TRAILER SHOWS THEY SHOULD BE, ST225/75R15 LR D ON 15 X ^ INCH WHEELS. THE STICKER IS OLD AND QUITE FADED, BUT, I CAN READ ENOUGH TO DETERMINE WHAT SHOULD BE THERE. THE TRAILER HAS A GVW OF 10840, AND LR C TIRES DON'T ADD UP TO THAT. I AM IN COMMUNICATION WITH FOREST RIVER, BUT, DO NOT HAVE A SOLID ANSWER YET. IN READING SOME RV FORUMS, IT SEEMS THAT THIS MANUFACTURER HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM IN THE PAST. ( UNDER RATED TIRES ) I AM JUST TRYING TO MAKE THE TRAILER SAFE TO TOW, AND AM ASKING FOREST RIVER TO PROVIDE ME WITH ACCURATE DETAILS OF WHAT THIS UNIT SHOULD HAVE ON IT. I WAS LUCKY TO ONLY HAVE MINOR TRAILER DAMAGE, AND WAS IN A RELATIVELY SAFE POSITION TO CHANGE THE TIRE. I NOW KNOW THAT, DESPITE HOW A TIRE LOOKS, THERE IS A USABLE AGE FOR TRAILER TIRES. I HAVE ALSO REACHED OUT TO THE DEALER I PURCHASED FROM, BUT WITH NO RESPONSE. THANK YOU.  *TR",
