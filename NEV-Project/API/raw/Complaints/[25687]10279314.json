        "summary": "THE FRONT SEAT HEAD RESTS OF MY 2008 FORD EDGE HAS AN ANGLE THAT STRETCHES MY NECK FORWARD IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE ANGLE. I GET SEVERE NECK PAIN IF THE BACK OF MY SEAT IS UP TO SUPPORT MY LUMBAR REGION. IF I LOWER THE BACK TO KEEP THE HEAD REST FROM JUTTING MY NECK FORWARD, MY LUMBAR REGION IS NOT SUPPORTED AND I GET BACK PAIN. SO, QUITE OFTEN I END UP WITH THE SEAT FORWARD TO SUPPORT MY LOWER BACK AND I SIT AT AN ANGLE TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT WITH MY HEAD TO THE SIDE OF THE HEAD REST AND ARMS RESTING ON THE ARM RESTS. SO I DRIVE AT AN ANGLE IN THE SEAT WITH AN S IN MY BACK. THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR MY BACK OR POSTURE AND NOT SAFE BECAUSE I AM NOT FACING STRAIGHT FORWARD.      I HAVE CALLED THE FORD DEALER I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM AND THEY DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANY SOLUTIONS FOR THIS, BUT NOTED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS WITH THIS. IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT I CONTACT YOU AND REPORT THIS PROBLEM . I HAVE AND HOPE THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS. *TR",
