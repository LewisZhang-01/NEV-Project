I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH YOU AT THAT TIME. I HAD 2 QUESTIONS; 1- WERE THERE ANY OTHER REPORTS OF SUCH CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THIS TIRE? 2- ARE THESE TIRES SAFE? I RECEIVED NO RESPONSE FROM YOUR AGENCY! LAST WEEK ANOTHER ONE OF THESE TIRES (@28,500 MILES)FAILED(ONE SIDE WALL COMPLETELY CAME APART).SO, I GUESS THAT ANSWERS QUESTION#2. I'VE SURVIVED 2 OF THESE FAILURES NOW WHILE MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN LESS FORTUNATE AND FIRESTONE AND GM RAKE IN THE $. SO, NOW I'M FORCED TO PAY FOR ANOTHER SET OF TIRES OR RIDE OUT ANOTHER FAILURE OR 2. I'LL SPEND THE $ BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT THE SAFETY OF MYSELF AND MY PASSENGERS!!!!  *NLM",
