I HAVE THE BRAKE PADS FROM THE VEHICLE AND THE PADS FROM THE DRIVER'S SIDE LOOK LIKE NEW. I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH DAIMLER CHRYSLER OVER THE WARRANTY ON THE CALIPER AND CONTEMPORARY CHRYSLER DODGER SAID IT WAS \"NORMAL WEAR\" AND \"BRAKE DUST AND DIRT PARTICLES\" THAT CAUSE THE CALIPER TO STICK? I BELIEVE IT IS NOT NORMAL FOR ONE SIDE TO BE WORN DOWN TO THE MEDAL? THE RIGHT REAR CALIPER FROZE AND CAUSED THE SAME PROBLEM AT APPROXIMATELY. 20,316 MI. BUT THE SERVICE WAS PERFORMED AT A DIFFERENT DEALER. ALSO, CAUSING SHIMMY IN THE FRONT END. *JB",
