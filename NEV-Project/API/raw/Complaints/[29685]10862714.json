I HAVE TAKEN IT INTO THE SHOP 4 DIFFERENT TIMES AND NO ISSUE WITH THE FILTER OR DRAIN PLUG CAN BE FOUND. IT NOW LEAKS OIL PROFUSELY (15K) AND CONSTANTLY HAS A BURNING SMELL AFTER DRIVEN FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. MY SERVICE CENTER HAS NOTED THAT MY ENGINE HAS AN \"OIL FILTER ADAPTER\" WHICH APPEARS TO BE NEW FOR THIS MODEL YEAR AND THE LEAK APPEARS TO BE EMANATING FROM THAT AREA. AFTER READING VARIOUS ARTICLES ON DIFFERENT FORUMS, IT APPEARS THAT THE PART # IN QUESTION IS 68105583AA AND APPLIES ONLY TO 2014 3.6L CHRYSLER V6 ENGINES.",
