I PLACED THE CAR IN NEUTRAL (I WAS STILL ROLLING) AND WAS ABLE TO STOP THE VEHIUCLE AND RESTART THE ENGINE.   I TOOK THE CAR INTO A 5-STAR DEALERSHIP (WHERE IT WAS PURCHASED FROM) AND THEY KEPT THE VEHICLE FOR 2 DAYS.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT CONCLUSION WAS THAT THEY COULD FIND NO TROUBLE.  I HAVE SEEN SIMILAR FAILURES WITH THIS VEHICLE ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE, SO I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED CASE.",
