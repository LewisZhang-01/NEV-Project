        "summary": "I OWN A 2002 FORD EXPLORER XLS WITH 51,300 MILES.  ON 11/23/06 TWO LONG CRACKS DEVELOPED IN MY LIFT GATE PANEL JUST TO THE RIGHT OF THE FORD EMBLEM.  ONE CRACK EXTENDS THE FULL LENGTH OF THE PANEL.  THE OTHER EXTENDS FROM THE TOP OF THE PANEL AND EXTENDS TO THE TOP OF THE FORD EMBLEM.      THESE CRACKS DEVELOPED COMPLETELY WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE OR FORCE BEING APPLIED TO THE PANEL.  THE TRUCK WAS PARKED IN THE CARPORT.  I RESEARCHED MY DAMAGE AND FOUND OTHERS WITH THE SAME MODEL EXPLORER WITH THE SAME DAMAGE IN THE SAME LOCATION.  SEVERAL OF THEM ADVISED THAT FORD WOULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE OR REPAIR THE DAMAGE.  THE LOCATION OF THE DAMAGE POSES A REAL DANGER IF THE PANEL COMPLETELY SEPARATES.  IF SEPARATION OCCURS THE GLASS CAN POSSIBLY SHATTER CAUSING DEATH OR INJURY.  I AM CONVINCED THE DAMAGE IS CAUSED BY A STRUCTURAL DEFECT IN THE PANEL WHICH IS IN NO WAY MY RESPONSIBILITY TO REPAIR.    I AM REQUESTING THAT FORD MOTOR COMPANY REPAIR THE DAMAGE AND POSSIBLY ISSUE A RECALL ON THE PANEL FOR THE 2002 FORD EXPLORER.  I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU SOON TO DISCUSS THE DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE. *JB",
