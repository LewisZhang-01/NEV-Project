THEY CHARGED ME TO HAVE THE SYSTEM FLUSHED OUT BECAUSE THE ANTI-FREEZE WOULD CLOG THE HEATER COILS.  NO HEATER IN WINTER.  PREVIOUSLY THE VEHICLE WAS OVER HEATED AND DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE THERMOSTAT AND WATER PUMP PLUS SEALS AND HEAD GASKET DUE TO THE ENGINE RUNNING TOO HOT. THIS IS THE 4TH TIME I'M RETURNING IT AND NOW THEY WANT ME REPAIR OR REPLACE THE RADIATOR.  IT IS STILL RUNNING HOT.  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING FROM TALKING TO THE MECHANICS THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR VEHICLE OF THIS VINTAGE AND IT TOOK A COUPLE OF YEARS FOR GM TO CHANGE ANTI-FREEZE MANUFACTURERS.   DO I HAVE ANY RECOURSE?   *NLM",
