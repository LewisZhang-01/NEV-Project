THIS WILL HAPPEN WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION OR HALTED (AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT OR BEFORE PULLING INTO TRAFFIC). IN PARTICULAR I HAVE BEEN PULLING INTO TRAFFIC AND HAD THE CAR NOT MOVE FORWARD OR SLOWLY ROLL FORWARD. I HAVE ALSO BEEN AT TRAFFIC LIGHTS, AND WHEN I PRESS THE ACCELERATOR THE CAR WILL NOT MOVE. THERE ARE NO WARNING LIGHTS BEFORE THE CAR STALLS/JERKS. AFTER THE CAR IS DRIVEN AROUND FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THE STALLING AND JERKING DOES NOT OCCUR AGAIN.      I HAVE HAD THE CAR FOR A YEAR AND AT FIRST DID NOT NOTICE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE JERKING. HOWEVER, IT DID STALL SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE THIS COMPLAINT.",
