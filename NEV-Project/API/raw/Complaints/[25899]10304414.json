THE CAR HIT A POTHOLE/SHARP BUMP 5 FEET BEFORE THE STOP SIGN AND THE CAR JERKED FORWARD FRIGHTENINGLY WHILE THE BRAKE WAS DEPRESSED. THE BRAKE PEDAL LOST ITS BREAKING ABILITY FOR 1 OR 2 SECONDS, BUT BECAME OPERATIONAL AGAIN AFTER THAT. DURING THE 1 OR 2 SECONDS, I FELT I LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR. THIS DEFECT IS REPRODUCIBLE AND HAS OCCURRED 5 TIMES SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR 6 MONTHS AGO. THIS IS VERY SCARY AND I THINK WILL CAUSE AN ACCIDENT IF NOT FIXED. *TR",
