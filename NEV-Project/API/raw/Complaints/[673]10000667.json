LAST MAY WE TRADED IN OUR LITTLE '97 CAVALIER THAT WE HAD TAKEN ON NUMEROUS TRIPS AND PRETTY MUCH TROUBLE FREE THE FIVE YEARS WE OWNED HER.  THEN WE BOUGHT THE '02 TRAIL BLAZER.  HAVEN'T GONE ON TOO MANY TRIPS WITH HIM YET, BUT EXCEPT FOR ONE PERFORMANCE FLAW THAT WE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT IS CAUSING US CONCERN WE LIKE THE CAR SO FAR.  THE CONCERN COMES WHEN WE HAVE TO BRAKE SUDDENLY TO AVOID A HAZARD IN THE ROAD.  THE CAR TENDS TO BECOME SQUIRRELIE AND FEELS AS THOUGH IT IS GOING TO FLIP OVER.  RATHER FRIGHTENING WHEN YOU NEED TO REACT QUICKLY AND SUDDENLY ARE FACED WITH THIS UNSETTLING SITUATION.  IS THERE OTHERS WHO ARE EXPERIANCING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR TRAIL BLAZERS?",
