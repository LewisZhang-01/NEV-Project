THIS HAS CAUSED US TO ALMOST BE HIT SEVERAL TIMES IN THE SIDE AND IN THE REAR. MOST OF THE TIME WHEN THIS HAPPENS THE CAR WITH TIRE MARKS LIGHT ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL COMES ON AND FLASHES. THERE IS NO WAY TO PREDICT WHEN THIS SUDDEN LOSS OF THE ACCELERATOR WILL HAPPEN. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS. THIS HAPPENS AT LEAST ONCE ALMOST EVERY TIME WE DRIVE.    ALSO SOMETIMES WHEN YOU START THE CAR AND BEGIN TO GO YOU HEAR DINGING SOUNDS AND FEEL AND HEAR BUMPS AND GRINDING NOISES. 2 LIGHTS COME ON IN THE INSTRUMENT PANEL WHEN THIS HAPPENS. 1 READS VSC TRAC AND THE OTHER READS TRAC OFF. IF YOU STOP AND RESTART THE ENGINE IT WILL EVENTUALLY STOP DOING IT. SOMETIMES THIS IS AFTER 1 RESTART AND SOMETIMES IT HAS TAKEN 5 AND 6. ON DAY IT WOULD NOT STOP NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU RESTARTED AND WE HAD TO DRIVE WITH LIGHTS ON. THIS HAS HAPPENED ABOUT 10 DIFFERENT TIMES.",
