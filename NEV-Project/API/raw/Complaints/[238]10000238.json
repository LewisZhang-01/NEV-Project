THE BMW 7.4 ON THE RIGHT SIDE (FIRST LANE) MERGED INTO THE CENTER LANE AND MADE A SUDDEN BRAKE. OWNER OF THE NISSAN ALTIMA APPLIED A SUDDEN BRAKE BUT BECAUSE OF THE SHORT DISTANCE IN BETWEEN TWO CARS, THE ALTIMA HIT THE BMW ON THE REAR. BOTH CARS WERE TRAVELING AT APPROXIMATELY 40-45 MILES PER HOUR. BOTH THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER AIRBAGS WERE NOT DEPLOY. THE PASSENGER, WHO IS 8 MONTH PREAGNANT, REQUIRED TO BE HOSPITALIZED FOR TWO DAYS.  I WOULD LIKE TO NISSAN COMPANY TO CAREFULLY INVESTIGATE ON WHAT HAPPENED WHY THE AIRBAGS WERE NOT DEPLOYED DURING THE COLLISION.",
