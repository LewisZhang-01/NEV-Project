        "summary": "I OWN A 2002 HYUNDAI SANTA FE.  THIS PAST WEEK A ROCK (APPROXIMATELY THE SIZE OF A BASEBALL) FELL OFF OF AN ONCOMING TRUCK AND HIT MY FRONT WINDSHIELD ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  MY CONCERN IS THAT THE ROCK CAME COMPLETELY THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, HIT THE DASHBOARD, & LANDED ON THE PASSENGER SIDE FLOOR.  FORTUNATELY MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS SEATED IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT SAW IT COMING & IN A SPLIT SECOND WAS ABLE TO COVER HER FACE & LEAN TOWARDS THE DRIVER'S SIDE.  IF THAT ROCK HAD HIT HER IT WOULD HAVE VERY SERIOUSLY INJURED HER OR WORSE.  I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THE ROCK CAME COMPLETELY THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD & WONDER IF THEIR IS A DEFECT IN THE SANTA FE.  THE GLASS TECHNICIAN THAT  REPAIRED THE WINDSHIELD SAID THAT ROCK SHOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH & HE ALSO SAID THAT THE HE FIXES A GREAT NUMBER OF SANTA FE WINDSHIELD.  I REALLY THINK THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO.  I HAVE EMAILED HYUNDAI & THEY BASICALLY SAID THEY WOULD ENTER IT INTO THAT DATABASE.  THAT WILL NOT SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.  WE WERE VERY LUCKY IN THIS SITUATION, BUT THE NEXT PERSON MAY NOT BE.  I WILL ALSO BE CONTACTING THE DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE TO INFORM THEM.  THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO READ MY CONCERN.      *NLM",
