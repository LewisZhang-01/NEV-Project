        "summary": "I BOUGHT THIS CAR BRAND NEW OFF THE LOT ON 01/12/01 WITH 14 MILES ON IT.  04/14/02 I WAS DRIVING THE CAR WHEN THE \"SERVICE ENGINE SOON\" LIGHT CAME ON AND STALLED OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION.  WHEN THE CAR WAS ABLE TO BE STARTED AGAIN, BLUE SMOKE WAS COMING OUT THE BACK.  I PARKED THE CAR NEARBY AND LET IT SIT FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES, AND WHEN I TRIED TO START THE CAR AGAIN, IT WOULD NOT STAY RUNNING, AND THERE WAS MORE BLUE SMOKE COMING OUT OF IT.  I CALLED THE DODGE TOWING SERVICE, AND HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE ORIGINAL DEALER THAT I BOUGHT IT AT.  THEY \"FIXED\" THE PROBLEM AND TOLD ME I HAD DIRTY GAS PARTICLES.  I HAVE HAD THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COME ON 4 TIMES SINCE THAT, AND THE CAR STALLS WHEN IN IDLE WHILE THE LIGHT IS ON.  THE DATES ARE AS FOLLOWS 04/14/02, 06/24/02, 01/13/03, 04/07/03, AND 04/29/03.  THE DEALER HAS ON THIS LAST ATTEMPT TO FIX MY VEHICLE THAT THE \"FIX\" THEY HAVE APPLIED AGAIN IS NOT PERMANENT (SAID IT MAY WORK FOR ANOTHER 4 MONTHS) AND THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY ANSWER FOR WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO MAKE MY VEHICLE A SAFE CAR TO BE IN AGAIN.  THEY ARE ADMITTING TO ME THAT THIS IS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINE PROBLEM, AND THAT THEY HAVE OTHER CONSUMERS OUT THERE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM I AM.  IN THE MEANTIME, I HAD SENT A LETTER OF DEFECT NOTIFICATION TO THE MANUFACTURER, DATED 04/22/03.  THE LETTER WAS SENT CERTIFIED, AND RETURN RECEIPT.  I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM THE MANUFACTURER THE MORNING OF 04/28/03 CONFIRMING THAT THEY RECEIVED MY LETTER AND PAPERWORK REGARDING THE LEMON LAW.  AS OF TODAY, 05/06/03, THE MANUFACTURER IS TELLING MY DEALER SERVICE MANAGER THAT THEY WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO TRADE ME INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE, BUT THAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO BUY THE VEHICLE BACK, DESPITE THE LEMON LAW OF AZ 44-1261. I AM IN THE PROCESS OF CONTACTING THE AZ ATTORNEY GENERAL, AND FILING A COMPLAINT WITH THE CENTER FOR AUTO SAFETY.  THANK YOU.   *NLM",
