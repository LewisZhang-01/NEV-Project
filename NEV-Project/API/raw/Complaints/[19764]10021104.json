        "summary": "I AM HAVING PROBLEMS WITH MY 2001 LEXUS GS300, WITH IT WANTING TO \"PULL/FOLLOW/WANDER\" WHEN DRIVING ON CERTAIN ROADS. I HAVE ADDRESSED THIS CONCERN WITH LEXUS, BUT THEIR HELP WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. THEY TELL ME THAT THIS IS THE NATURE OF THE VEHICLE, EVEN WHEN ANOTHER LEXUS GS300 (2003) DOES NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM. I HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM SINCE THE DAY I PURCHASED MY LEXUS. WHEN I TOOK IT IN FOR THE 1000 MILE CHECK-UP- I BROUGHT UP THE CONCERN, BUT WHAT I GOT WAS \u001cTHAT THE STEERING LOOSENS, A LITTLE AS THE CAR AGES\u001d. WHEN I MENTIONED THIS TO ONE LEXUS DEALER- HE INDICATED THAT THAT WAS NOT TRUE AND THAT WAS AN UNACCEPTABLE ANSWER.    TODAY, I CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND IT HAS NOT BEEN AN ADDRESS BY LEXUS, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT THEY SAY IT\u0019S THE NATURE OF THE CAR. THIS CAR CURRENTLY HAS LEXUS OEM 17\u001d WHEELS FROM A LEXUS GS430- THE GS300 HAS 16\u001d WHEELS, BUT EVEN WITH THESE IT\u0019S A PROBLEM.    THANKS    DANNY ZAMORA.  *AK",
