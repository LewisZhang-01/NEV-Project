        "summary": "I OWN A 1999 FORD WINDSTAR VAN WITH APPROXIMATELY 50,000 MILES THAT IS USED FOR PLEASURE PURPOSES ONLY. TWO DAYS AGO THE POWER STEERING UNIT COMMENCED HOWLING WHENEVER THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TURNED. YESTERDAY I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE FORD DEALER IN ARCADIA. DURING THE DRIVE TO THE DEALER THE VEHICLE APPEARED TO STEER CORRECTLY. HOWEVER, WHEN THE SERVICE MAN AT THE DEALER TRIED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE INTO THE STALL HE SAID THAT THE STEERING HAD FROZEN AND WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO STEER. SUBSEQUENTLY THE DEALER, AFTER CHECKING THE POWER STEERING UNIT, DECIDED THAT THE PUMP IN THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM HAD FAILED CAUSING COMPONENT PIECES TO PASS THROUGH THE SYSTEM CAUSING THE STEERING FAILURE.THE DEALER SAID THE REPAIR WOULD REQUIRE REPLACING THE PUMP AND ALL COMPONENTS OF THE SYSTEM AT A COST OF MORE THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS. MY CONCERN IS THE STEERING COULD HAVE FAILED ON THE HIGHWAY CAUSING A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. IN ADDITION, FAILURE OF THE POWER STERRING UNIT AT SUCH LOW MILEAGE LEAVES THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS MIGHT BE A DEFECT IN OTHER CARS....THUS THE REPORT TO YOU. THE FORD DEALER'S TELEPHONE NUMBER IN ARCADIA IS 863 494 4848",
