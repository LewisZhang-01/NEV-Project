        "summary": "THERE IS A COMMON THREAD WITH GEARSHIFT SELECTOR BREAKAGE ON FORD EXPLORERS WHICH INDICATES THAT RECALL IS URGENTLY NEEDED. IN THE DRIVEWAY OF MY HOUSE, WITH CAR IN PARK, I TRIED TO SHIFT INTO REVERSE TO BACK OUT. THE GEARSHIFT SELECTOR ON THE STEERING COLUMN BROKE OFF AND JUST DANGLED. I REMOVED THE RUBBER COVER ON THE STEERING COLUMN TO HAVE A LOOK, AND I COULD SEE ROUGH METAL WHERE END OF GEARSHIFT SELECTOR ROD MEETS WITH JOINT INSIDE THE STEERING COLUMN, INDICATING THAT THE METAL SIMPLY BROKE THERE. CALLED SERVICE AT FORD DEALER IN HENDERSON NV, WAS TOLD THAT ENTIRE STEERING COLUMN NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AT PARTS + LABOR COST OF $1920. HAD I BEEN PARKED ON A HILLY STREET IN SAN FRANCISCO, E.G., A SERIOUS ACCIDENT MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED WITH THE CAR OUT OF CONTROL. RECALL IS URGENTLY NEEDED BEFORE PEOPLE ARE INJURED DUE TO THIS OBVIOUS DEFECT!!! *TR",
