THEN THE BRAKE LIGHTS BEGAN TO STICK I HAVE TO PULL UP ON THE PEDAL TO GET THEM TO GO OFF AND THE STEERING WHEEL  POPS WHEN GOING AROUND A CURVE.  NOW THE CAR SITS AT A REPAIR SHOP NEEDING A TRANSMISSION BECAUSE THE DRIVE AND REVERSE GEARS FAILED LEAVING ME WITH A BILL OF 800-2000 TO REPAIR IT. I BELIEVE IF THE MANUFACTURERS WOULD'VE DONE THEIR JOB RIGHT IN THE BEGINNING ALOT MORE PEOPLE WOULD BE PROUD TO OWN A DODGE!    *NLM",
