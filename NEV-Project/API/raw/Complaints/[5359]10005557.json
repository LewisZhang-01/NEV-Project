WHO SAID IT WAS AN INTERNAL PROBLEM THAT COULD ONLY BE FIXED BY FORD DEALERSHIP OR A MACHINE SHOP. IT WAS A HOLIDAY SO WE TOOK IT TO A MACHINE SHOP WHO VERIFIED HIS PREVIOUS ENCOUNTER WITH THE SAME MODEL ENGINE BEFORE THAT A ROD WAS BENT WHICH CRACKED THE PISTON, CAUSED FROM A \"DEFECT IN FORD'S INTAKE HEAD GASKET\", WHICH LEAKED WATER INTO THE ENGINE. HE ALSO STATED ONE MORE CRANK OR RUN A LITTLE LONGER THE PISTON WOULD HAVE SHATTERED AND GONE THROUGH THE CRANK SHAFT WHICH COULD HAVE ENDANGERED ANYONE IN IT'S RANGE (HWY, ETC.). THE ENGINE IS NOW BEING REPAIRED AND WHEN FORD WAS CONTACTED THEY DENIED ANY PROBLEM WITH THE GASKET AND ANY RESPONSIBILITY. THE MACHINE SHOP HAS A \"SERVICE NOTIFICATION\" THAT THE GASKET HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH ONE THAT WILL NOT LEAK. THIS IS A VERY COSTLY DEFECT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF FORD HAD SENT NOTICE TO OWNER'S. I FEEL FORD SHOULD OWN UP TO THEIR DEFECTIVE PART AND PAY FOR COSTS OWNER'S LIKE MYSELF HAVE ENCOUNTERED. I HAVE A NOTICE OF RECALL FOR A DIFFERENT GASKET LEAKING COOLANT WHICH WAS REPLACED BY THE FORD DEALERSHIP, #99B29.",
