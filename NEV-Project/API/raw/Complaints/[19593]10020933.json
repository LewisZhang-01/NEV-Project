IT HAS MADE ME SICK TO MY STOMACH AT TIMES AND MY WIFE AND KIDS CAN NOT STAND THE CONTINUOUS SMELL EITHER.  I AM VERY UPSET WITH THIS AND WOULD LIKE A REFUND OF MY PURCHASE PRICE.  TOYOTA SENT OUT A TSB REGARDING THE SMELL SAYING IT WAS THE GASOLINE (POOR) THAT PEOPLE USE.  WRONG!  I USE AMOCO AND TEXACO ONLY.  *AK",
