TWICE I HAVE TRIED TO FILL THE TANK, BUT THE GAS KEEPS TURNING OFF AT THE PUMP.  WHEN I RETURN HOME AND PARK THE CAR IN THE GARAGE, YOU CAN SMELL GAS AFTER AWHILE AND IT LINKERS FOR A FEW DAYS.  I WAS LOOKING FOR A RECALL NOTICE ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE I READ IN OTHER PLACES ON THE INTERNET SIMILAR ISSUES.  JUST CURIOUS IF YOU WERE NOTIFIED OF SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THE 2014 CORVETTE STINGRAY COUPE.",
