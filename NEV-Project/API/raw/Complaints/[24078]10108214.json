        "summary": "MY ROOM MATE WAS GIVING ME A RIDE TO THE AIRPORT IN MY 1994 FORD F-150.  WE GOT TWO BLOCKS, AND SMOKE STARTED COMING OUT OF THE HOOD.  WE PULLED OVER TO LOOK UNDER THE HOOD AND THE CRUISE SPEED CONTROL DEVICE WAS SMOKING.  THE SMOKE STOPPED WHEN THE ENGINE WAS TURNED OFF.  WE TURNED AROUND AND PARKED IT IN THE DRIVEWAY.  I LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD AGAIN, AND THERE WAS NO SMOKE.  I CALLED A FRIEND TO GIVE ME A RIDE IN HER CAR.  WHEN I ARRIVED IN KANSAS CITY, I CALLED MY ROOMMATE TO TELL HER I MADE IT OK.  SHE TOLD ME THAT 2 HOURS AFTER I LEFT, MY TRUCK CAUGHT ON FIRE WITH FLAMES ROARING OUT 5 FEET HIGH.  IT WAS JUST SITTING THERE PARKED IN THE DRIVEWAY! THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD TO COME AND PUT IT OUT.  MY TRUCK IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED EXCEPT FOR THE BED.    FOUR DAYS AFTER THE INCIDENT, I WAS WATCHING THE NEWS. THEY WERE DOING A REPORT ON HOW 800,000 FORD F-150'S WERE BEING RECALLED DUE TO A FAULTY CRUISE SPEED CONTROL.  MY INSURANCE WILL NOT COVER THE DAMAGE.  I LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK AND CANNOT GET A LOAN BECAUSE I FILED BANKRUPTCY A COUPLE YEARS AGO.  THAT TRUCK WAS PAID FOR.  MY JOB IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN.  I REALLY NEEDED THAT TRUCK.*AK",
