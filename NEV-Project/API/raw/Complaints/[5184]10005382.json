CALLED FORD MOTOR AND NONE OF THEIR SUGGESTIONS WORKED. HAD TO HAVE FOCUS TOWED TO LOCAL DEALER TO REPAIR AND REKEY IGNITION CYLINDER. TOTAL COST $260+ (WHICH IS LOW FROM WHAT I HEAR). TOW DRIVER MENTIONED SOMETHING VERY FISHY,\"I'VE TOWED MORE THAN 12 FOCUS'S AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM HAD THIS SAME IGNITION/KEY PROBLEM... ...FORD WONT RECALL UNTIL THIS IGNITION/KEY PROBLEM BECOMES A SAFETY ISSUE WHEN SOMEONE FREEZES ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BECAUSE THEY CANNOT START THEIR CAR.\" INTERESTING. FORD MUST BE REQUIRED TO RECAL FOR THIS PROBLEM. ITS A TRAP FOR DEALERS TO MAKE MONEY OFF THIS PROBLEM. PLEASE FOLLOW UP!",
