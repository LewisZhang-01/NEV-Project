TOOK REMAINING PARTS OF TIRE INTO FIRESTONE AND WAS TOLD BY A REPRESENTATIVE \"I CAN WARRANTY OUT THE DAMAGED TIRE AS A DEFECT, BUT CANNOT REPLACE OTHER THREE TIRES - THEY LOOK FINE\". I EXPLAINED THE OTHER TIRE WAS \"FINE\" UNTIL IT BLEW OUT ON THE HIGHWAY, I WAS SHOCKED THAT HE WAS WILLING TO WARRANTY THE DAMAGED TIRE AS A DEFECT, BUT WOULD NOT REPLACE THE OTHER TIRES OF THE SAME MAKE AND MODEL. I HAVE PICTURES OF THE DAMAGED TIRE AND COMPARED IT TO OTHER BLOW OUTS WHICH HAVE CAUSED FATAL ACCIDENTS AND FOUND MY TIRE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE OTHER BLOW OUTS. THE POLICE OFFICER WHO SHOWED UP TO THE ACCIDENT DID NOT TAKE A REPORT BUT DID SAY THAT EVEN AT HIGH SPEEDS OR LAYING A SPIKE STRIP DOWN WOULD NOT CAUSE A BLOW OUT LIKE THIS AND SUSPECTED A DEFECT.*JB",
