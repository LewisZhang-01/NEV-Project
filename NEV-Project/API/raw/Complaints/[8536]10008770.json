        "summary": "I HAVE HAD MY 2000 VENTURE IN FOR POWER SLIDING DOOR REPAIRS THREE TIMES. THE FIRST TWO TIMES THE DEALER ATTEMPTED TO FIX THE PROBLEM ACCORDING TO THE SAFETY RECALL BULLETIN. THE PROBLEM STILL PERSISTED, AND WAS FIXED WHEN THE DEALER INSTALLED  A NEW POWER SLIDING DOOR MOTOR AND CLUTCH ASSEMBLY. THIS STOPPED THE DOOR FROM INTERMITTENT BINDING, AND NOW  THE POWER SLIDING DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES CORRECTLY. THE DEALER REPLACED THE MOTOR, CLUTCH ASSEMBLY, ACTUATOR AND RETAINER. DAN KRUSE PONTIAC (THE DEALER) WAS VERY NICE, AND I WASN'T CHARGED FOR THIS SERVICE. TO WHOM THIS BILL WENT TO I DON'T KNOW. BUT, I HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THIS VAN. THE REASON I HAVE SUBMITTED THIS REPORT IS THAT THE SAFETY RECALL ON THE 2000 VENTURE VAN MAY NOT ENTIRELY FIX THIS PROBLEM. THE \"BINDING\" PROBLEM THAT EXISTED ON THE POWER SLIDING DOOR MAY HAVE WEAKENED THE POWER SLIDING DOOR MOTOR AND CLUTCH ASSEMBLY TO WHERE IT HAS TO BE REPAIRED. THE ORIGINAL SAFETY RECALL ON THE POWER SLIDING DOOR PROBLEM MAY NOT BE COMPLETE YET. THANKS.**** DIMS 11 IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****761006. *AK   *JB",
