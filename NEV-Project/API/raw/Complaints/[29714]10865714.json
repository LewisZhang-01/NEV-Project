        "summary": "I REPORTED DURING THE LAST OIL CHANGE THAT THE CAR WAS STALLING SPECIFICALLY WHEN TRYING TO ACCELERATE BETWEEN 10 MPH & 30 MPH. THE CAR STALLS, AND HAS EVEN COMPLETELY STOPPED FOR A FULL 60 SECONDS WHILE TRYING TO CHANGE LANES IN  TRAFFIC EVEN THOUGH THE GAS PEDAL WAS COMPLETED DEPRESSED. THIS ALMOST CAUSED ME TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT. THE TECH SAID IT WAS DUE TO THE ECON BUTTON AND THE ENGINE TRYING TO CONSERVE ENERGY. I WAS TOLD TO NOT USE THE ECON BUTTON (ALTHOUGH THIS IS SUPPOSE TO SAVE ME MONEY ON GAS AND FUEL EFFICIENCY AND PART OF THE ALLURE OF THE VEHICLE.) DESPITE THAT I HAVE HAD THE ECON BUTTON OFF AND THE CAR CONTINUES TO STALL AND NOT ACCELERATE PROPERLY. AGAIN THIS IS USUALLY BETWEEN 10 MPG TO 30 MPH. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM OR PART OF THE PISTOL PIN SNAP RING PROBLEM OR EVEN POSSIBLY A FUEL INJECTOR PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE GETTING WORSE AND OCCURRING MORE FREQUENTLY.  MY HUSBAND HAS THE SAME TYPE AND YEAR VEHICLE AND HIS DOES NOT BEHAVE THE SAME WAY. HIS ACCELERATION APPEARS TO BE FINE AND DOES NOT STALL AS MINE DOES. ALSO THE TIRE PRESSURE GAUGE HAS COME ON TWICE FOR NO APPARENT REASON. ONCE WAS 8-15-15 DURING A 4 HOUR ROAD TRIP WHICH OCCURRED AFTER WE ARRIVED. THE 2ND TIME WAS IMMEDIATELY AFTER I RETURNED HOME FROM MY LAST OIL CHANGE IN 4-2016. THIS IS THE (3RD) REPORTED PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE. PROBLEM (1) WAS THE STAINED HEADLINER (6/2015)WHICH WAS REPLACED AND HAS NOT HAD ANY FURTHER ISSUES (2) WAS THE CENTER CONSOLE PIN COMING LOOSE AND POPPING UP (4-2016) WHICH HAS CURRENTLY REMAINED INTACT AND NOW THE ACCELERATION IS GETTING WORSE. (CONTINUOUSLY).",
