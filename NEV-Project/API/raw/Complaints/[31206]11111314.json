I UNDERSTAND THAT A RECALL FOR THIS FAILURE WAS DENIED FOR GENERAL MOTORS TRUCKS UP TO THE 2003 MODEL YEAR BUT MY TRUCK IS A 2005 MODEL, AND BASED ON WHAT I HAVE LEARNED, THIS FAILURE CONTINUES WITH NEWER MODELS. THIS RECALL NEEDS TO BE RE-OPENED AND RE-INVESTIGATED BY PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS AND MECHANICS. I'VE WORKED ON MOTOR VEHICLES ALL MY ADULT LIFE, FOR A TIME AS A CERTIFIED NEW YORK STATE INSPECTOR EVEN, AND NEVER SAW A CORROSION RELATED BRAKE FAILURE OF THIS NATURE. MY TRUCK IS NOT A WORK TRUCK. THIS TYPE OF BRAKE FAILURE CAN, AND LIKELY HAS BEEN THE RESULT OF FATAL ACCIDENTS. THERE ARE NOW WELL OVER 3.5K COMPLAINTS AND HUNDREDS OF ACCIDENTS RELATING TO THIS SPECIFIC BRAKE FAILURE ON GM TRUCKS.",
