THE FLICKERING IS ENOUGH THAT OTHER VEHICLES THAT I AM FOLLOWING SLOW DOWN OR PULL OVER.  MY CAR LIGHTS WILL DIM WHEN ELECTRIC MOTORS ARE USED SUCH AS POWER WINDOWS OR THE ENGINE FAN COME ON, ALSO WHEN THE REAR WINDOW DEICER IS TURNED ON.  DEALER RESPONSE HAS BASICALLY BEEN THAT SATURN ACKNOWLEDGES THE CONDITION AS A NORMAL CONDITION OF THE CAR. INCIDENT NOT ONLY TIME",
