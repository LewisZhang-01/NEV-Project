ON BOTH OCCASIONS I WAS REACHING OVER TO GET SOMETHING FROM THE PASSENGER SEAT AND THE BUCKLE CAME UNDONE.  I THOUGHT I HAD NOT SECURED IT PROPERLY BECAUSE MY ARM HIT THE LOCK ON THE SEAT BELT.  NOW I FIND OUT TODAY THAT I MAY HAVE HIT THE BUCKLE BUT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE POPPED OPEN AS THERE IS A DEFECT IN THE SEAT BELT.  EVEN THOUGHT IT IS A 2000 MODEL I DO NOT HAVE THE GEN 4 TYPE OF BELTS IN THE FRONT.  THE VAN MUST HAVE BEEN MANUFACTURED IN THE LATE 1999.   *NLM",
