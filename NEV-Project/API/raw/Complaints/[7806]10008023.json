THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THE DEALERSHIP HAS INFORMED ME THAT THERE IS AN ABNORMALITY IN MY ENGINE WHICH WILL CAUSE THIS PROBLEM TO CONTINUE TO RE-OCCUR UNLESS I PAY $5000 TO HAVE A NEW ENGINE PUT IN.  FORD HAS RECALLED SIMILIAR VEHICLES DUE TO THE PROBLEMS WITH THE SAME ENGINES, HOWEVER OFFERS NO ASSISTANCE ON THEIR MUCH PRICIER EXPEDITION.  I GUESS THEY FIGURE WE CAN AFFORD THE REPAIRS.  THEY REFUSE TO DISCUSS MY PROBLEMS AND TELL ME THAT BLOWN HEAD GASKETS ARE CONSIDERED \"NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR\".  THE HEAD GASKET PROBLEM ASIDE, THIS CAR HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP OVER 30 TIMES FOR NON-ROUTINE MAINTENANCE ISSUES.  THE LEATHER SEATS HAD TO BE REPLACED, THE EXTERIOR MOLDING WENT BAD, THE EXHAUST SYSTEM WAS FAULTY, WIRING WAS FAULTY, MIRRORS AND WINDOWS WERE FAULTY, ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS WERE FAULTY, THE LIST GOES ON AND ON.",
