ON THE 16TH OF MARCH 2003 MY FAMILY AND I WERE IN A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT IN CORPUS CHRISTI TEXAS. WE WERE HEADING HOME TO NEW BRAUNFELS TEXAS WHEN I RAN INTO CONSTRUCTION AND THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC CAME TO A STOP AND A FULL SIZE VAN REAR ENDED MY MINIVAN AT ABOUT 30MPH.  IN THE CAR I HAD MY PREGNANT WIFE, MOTHER, DAD AND 2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. THE CAR WAS A 2002 DODGE CARAVAN AND MY DAUGHTER WAS STRAPPED INTO THE CAR SEAT AND EVERYONE ELSE WAS USING THEIR SEATBELTS. MY MOMS SEATBELT WHICH WAS LOCATED ON THE CENTER BENCH SEAT DIRECTLY BEHIND THE PASSENGER SEAT CAME UNDONE. IT HELD AT THE INITIAL IMPACT BUT GAVE WAY AFTER THAT. TWO THINGS THAT SAVED HER WERE MY ARM AND MY FATHER'S SEAT WHICH IS THE SECOND PROBLEM I HAVE SNAPPED BACK AND BROKE AND PINNED HER LEGS AND PREVENTED HER FROM FLYING THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. MY SEAT AND HER CENTER BENCH SEAT ALSO SNAPPED BACK AND INJURED MY DAUGHTER.    *NLM",
