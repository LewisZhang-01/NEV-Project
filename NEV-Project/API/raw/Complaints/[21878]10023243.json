        "summary": "THE RUBBER HOSE CONNECTING THE GAS LINE TAKE-UP TO THE GENERATOR LINE WAS INSTALLED WITH A SHARP \"U\" SHAPE.  THIS CAUSED THE HOSE TO BE STRESSED AND RESULTED IN CRACKS THAT SPLIT.   MY WIFE HAD MENTIONED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS THAT SHE SMELLED GASOLINE WHEN THE REAR BEDROOM WINDOW WAS OPEN.  I COULD NEVER FIND ANY GAS DRIPPING AND THOUGHT IT WAS POSSIBLY A VENT FOR THE GAS TANK.  FINALLY, THE GENERATOR FAILED TO START.  I THOUGHT THE FUEL PUMP HAD FAILED.  I REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP AND STILL HAD THE PROBLEM.  I TOOK THE MOTORHOME TO CAROLINA COACH & CAMPER AND FOUND OUT REAL PROBLEM WAS THE KINKED HOSE.  IT COST ME 50 GALLONS OF GAS AND SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS TO HAVE THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT DRAIN AND DROP THE GAS TANK TO REPLACE THE $2.00 HOSE.    I FEEL VERY FORTUNATE THAT THE GAS OR THE FUMES EMANATING FROM THE SPLIT HOSE DID NOT EXPLODE FROM CONTACTING SOMETHING HOT UNDER THE COACH.  THE MOTORHOME WAS ONLY THREE YEARS OLD AND THE GENERATOR HAD LESS THAN 100 HOURS ON IT WHEN I HAD THIS PROBLEM.  I FEEL FLEETWOOD USED AND IMPROPERLY INSTALLED AN INFERIOR GRADE OF GAS LINE HOSE.    FLEETWOOD SHOULD RECALL ALL BOUNDERS THAT WERE ASSEMBLED USING RUBBER HOSE TO CONNECT THE GAS LINE TO THE GENERATOR WITH AUTOMOTIVE TYPE FUEL LINES.  *JB",
