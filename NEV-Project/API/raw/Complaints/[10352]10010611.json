        "summary": "PURCHASED '99 FORD TAURUS FROM HERTZ DEALERSHIP IN JULY 2000.  AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WOULD CONSTANTLY COME ON WHEN IN THE OFF POSITION.  SOMETIMES OCCURS RIGHT AFTER SIGNAL HAS BEEN USED BUT NOT ALWAYS.  WILL OCCUR AT RANDOM.  WHEN TAKEN BACK TO HERTZ DEALERSHIP, MECHANIC INFORMED ME THAT IT IS A KNOWN FORD MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND MUST BE FIXED BY THEM.  WHEN I CONTACTED THE FORD DEALERSHIP, THEY STATED THEY WOULD ONLY FIX THE DEFECT WITHOUT CHARGE IF THE MILEAGE WAS UNDER 30,000.  AT THE TIME, MY MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 29,995.  CONSTANT ATTEMPTS TO HAVE PROBLEM RESOLVED BY FORD HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL.  FORD DEALERSHIP STATED THAT PROBLEM WITH THE WIRING WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ON FORD CARS BUT ONLY ON VANS AND TRUCKS.  REQUEST ANY ASSISTANCE IN RESOLVING THIS MATTER SINCE THE DEFECT IS A FORD FACTORY DEFECT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED TO FORD OWNERS BY FORD WITHOUT PENALTY.  SHOULD BE HANDLED WITHOUT COST TO LOYAL FORD OWNERS.   *NLM",
