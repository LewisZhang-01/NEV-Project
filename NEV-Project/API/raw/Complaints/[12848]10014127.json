I WAS TOLD  BY THE SERVICE MANGER NOT TO WORRY, USE A LITTLE CW SPREAD; 3 DAYS LATER, THE STEERING COLUMN AND IGNITION CAUGHT ON FIRE.  SATURN IS REFUSING TO HONOR SAFETY RECALL TSB # 97-C-02, DATED APR 97, TITLED, \"RECALL-IGNITION CYLINDER MALFUNCTION.\"  I UNDERSTAND THAT UNDER FEDERAL LAW A MANUFACTURER-INITIATED SAFETY RECALL IS EQUAL TO A NHTSA SAFETY RECALL AND MUST BE REMEDIED AT NO COST TO THE CONSUMER. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE IN THIS MATTER. ANTHONY A. SESSA    P. S.  I AM NOT SURE WHEN MY DECEASED FATHER PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE.   *NLM",
