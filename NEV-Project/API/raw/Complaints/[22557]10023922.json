        "summary": "I OWN A 1998 PONTIAC BONNEVILLE. THE MANIFOLD COVERS ARE MADE OF PLASTIC AND EVENTUALLY CRACK CAUSING ANTIFREEZE TO ENTER THE ENGINE CAUSING VAPOR LOCK. THE ENGINE SHUTS OFF LEAVING THE DRIVER WITH NO POWER STEERING OR START UP CAPABILITIES BECAUSE THE STARTER CONE ON THIS INCIDENT WAS BLOWN OFF DUE TO INTENSE PRESSURE. MY 17 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING AT THE TIME AND I'M THANKFUL THAT SHE WAS IN TOWN TRAVELING ONLY AROUND 25 MPH. I DREAD THE THOUGHT WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED ON THE EXPRESSWAY. I HAVE HEARD OF AND READ OF SEVERAL CASES THAT ARE EXACTLY LIKE THIS ONE. GENERAL MOTORS IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM YET REFUSES TO RECALL THIS MANIFOLD COVER PROBLEM. MY VEHICLE IS WELL MAINTAINED AND HAS ONLY 83000 MILES ON IT. THERE IS NO WAY THIS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. IT IS VERY COSTLY TO MYSELF AS A CONSUMER. IT RAN ME NEARLY $900 DOLLARS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. HOPEFULLY THERE ISN'T ANY LONG TERM DAMAGE (WHICH I UNDERSTAND THERE WILL BE) TO MY ENGINE FROM THIS PROBLEM.   *NLM",
