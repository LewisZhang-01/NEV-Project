THEY ARE NOW VIBRATING AGAIN (36,800 MILES) DUE TO WARPING.  I STILL HAVE THE ORIGINAL BRAKE PADS (ONLY 50% WORN). THE DEALERSHIP IS NOW SUGGESTING THAT THE ROTORS BE TURNED ($138)WHICH I FEEL IS ONLY A TEMPORARY FIX.  THEY SAY ITS 'NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR'.   I COMPLETELY DISAGREE.  I'M NOT TOWING ANYTHING NOR DO I LIVE IN A MOUNTAINOUS AREA WHERE LONG DOWN-HILL BRAKING COULD BE AN ISSUE.  THIS IS CLEARLY A DESIGN FLAW ON THE PART OF TOYOTA.  *JB",
