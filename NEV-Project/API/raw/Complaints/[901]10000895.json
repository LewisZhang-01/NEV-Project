IT'S SILVER AND SINCE THEN I'VE SEEN MANY OF THE SAME COLOR, HAVEING THIS PROBLEM: FORD AND CHEVY HAD A PAINT RECALL; WHY WON'T DODGE?  NOW THE TRUCK IS 80% PEELING, PERSONALLY I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE OF BAD PRIMER.  I HAVE TALKED TO FOUR DODGE DEALERSHIPS IN THE AREA, THEY ALL TOLD ME THEY HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT COLOR.  THEY SAID THEY CAN'T BELIEVE THE MANUFACTURE WON'T STAND  BEHIND THEIR WORK AND COMPENSATE THE OWNERS.",
