        "summary": "BRAKE ROTORS AND FRONT WHEEL ASSEMBLY FAILURE AT APPROXIMATELY 40,000 MILES. SEVERE FRONT END VIBRATION ON BRAKE APPLICATION. SIX VISITS TO TURN ROTORS, REPLACE REAR ROTORS AT 50,000 MILES, FINALLY REPLACE FRONT ROTORS AT 63,000 MILES THEN NEW BRAKE PADS AT 73,000. STILL NO CURE. FORD REFUSED INITIALLY TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS, SO I WAS TAKING VEHICLE TO LOCAL TIRE/BRAKE SHOP.  SCHAWB TIRE 1201 HILLTOP DR REDDING CA.96003...PH. 530 221-5314.... FINALLY TOOK PICKUP TO DEALER, FOUND FRONT HUB FAILURE, WORN OUT BALL JOINTS, WARPED ROTORS. COVERED UNDER EXTENDED WARRANTY. HOWEVER....7,000 MILES LATER, PROBLEM IS BACK!. AT TIME OF SERVICE BY CORNING FORD, I ASKED SERVICE MANAGER, STEVE LOWERY, WHAT WAS TO PREVENT THE BRAKES FROM FAILING AGAIN IN THIS MANNER.  HE SAID... NOTHING! SURE ENOUGH, HE WAS RIGHT! THIS STARTED IN 2001, ON THE WAY HOME FROM ALASKA..IN THE YUKON. TOOK IT TO SHOP AS SOON AS I GOT HOME. MY EXTENDED CNA SERVICE WARRANTY TERMINATES AT 100,000 MILES. SINCE I KEEP MY VEHICLES FOR 200,000 TO 300,000 MILES, I'M VERY CONCERNED AS TO THE POTENTIAL SAFETY PROBLEMS THAT THIS FAILURE COULD CAUSE, AND THE MONEY OUT OF MY POCKET TO KEEP THIS VEHICLE IN SAFE OPERATING CONDITION. I'M SUBMITTING THIS IN HARD COPY ALSO WITH CORRESPONDING BILLS BY WAY OF US MAIL . THANK YOU.    *NLM",
