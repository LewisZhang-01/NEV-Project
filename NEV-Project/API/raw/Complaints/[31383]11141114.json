ON OCTOBER 11TH 2018, MY ACADIA WAS RENDERED COMPLETELY DISABLED BY A WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY THE DEALERSHIP AS A \" DEAD BATTERY\"  I WAS ALMOST LOCKED IN THE VEHICLE BECAUSE THE ENTIRE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM FAILED AND THE ELECTRONIC LOCKS WOULD NOT OPERATE. THERE WAS NO PREVIOUS INDICATION, NOTIFICATION OR WARNING BY THE  VEHICLE AND MONITORING SERVICE OR OF AN IMPENDING BATTERY FAILURE    OBVIOUSLY, A 10 MONTH OLD BATTERY IN A NEW CAR SHOULD NOT BE COMPLETELY DRAINED AFTER ONLY 10 MONTHS OF OWNERSHIP ( LEADING ME TO BELIEVE THERE MAY BE MORE AT PLAY THAN JUST A BAD BATTERY). HAD THIS HAPPENED ANYWHERE ELSE BESIDES MY DRIVEWAY, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MAJOR ISSUE. THE VEHICLE WAS THEN TOWED TO THE NEAREST AUTHORIZED GMC REPAIR FACILITY.  THE DEALERSHIP RAN DIAGNOSTIC TESTS OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AND FOUND NOTHING WRONG, BUT THIS STILL LEAVES ME WITH DOUBTS ABOUT THE RELIABILITY OF THE VEHICLE AND INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.",
