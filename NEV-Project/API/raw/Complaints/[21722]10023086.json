        "summary": "I HAVE RUN OUT OF FUEL TWICE DESPITE THE FUEL GAGE SHOWING 1/4 FULL. FIRST TIME, AT ABOUT 15,000 MILES, THE CAR WAS TOWED BY ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE TO A SERVICE DEALER. THEY CLAIMED TO HAVE SPENT TWO HOURS OF DIAGNOSTICS AND COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG EXCEPT THAT THE CAR WOULDN'T START. THEY THEN PUT IN SOME FUEL AND THE CAR WORKED FINE. THEY SAID THEY NEVER CHECKED THE FUEL GAGE. THEY CHARGED ME $200 AS \"DIAGNOSTIC CHARGES\". THEY SAID THAT THE CHARGE WAS NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY AS THEY HAD NOT FOUND ANYTHING WRONG. THEY IMPLIED THAT MAYBE I HAD JUST MADE A MISTAKE BY NOT NOTICING THE FUEL GAGE WAS EMPTY (DESPITE SPENDING AN HOUR ON THE PHONE WITH GM ROADSIDE WAITING FOR THE TOW TRUCK TO ARRIVE - WE CHECKED ALL THE GAUGES). THEIR MECHANIC HAD NOT BOTHERED TO LOOK AT THE GAGE  WHILE STARTING TO WORK ON THE CAR. GM REFUSED TO REIMBURSE THE $200.   THE SECOND TIME THE FUEL GAGE WAS STILL ABOVE EMPTY BUT THE CAR WENT DEAD. WHEN I PUT IN 1.5 GALLONS, IT STILL DIDN'T START. WHEN I PUT IN AN ADDITIONAL 1.5 GALLONS, THE GAGE WENT UP AND THE CAR STARTED FINE.   I HAVE NOT HAD THIS PROBLEM FOR THE PAST 18 MONTHS - BUT I NOW FILL UP AS SOON AS IT REACHES ANYWHERE NEAR THE 1/4 MARK.   *NLM",
