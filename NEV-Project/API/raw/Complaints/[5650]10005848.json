THE SEATS ARE NOT ONLY VERY HEAVY, BUT THE REARWARD JERKING MOTION RECOMMENDED BY MY DEALER TO REMOVE THE SEAT OFTEN FAILS TO DISENGAGE THE SEAT, CAUSING BACK INJURY. MY DEALER TOLD ME THE SPECIFIC SEATS I HAVE ARE NOT BROKEN, BUT THEY AGREED THAT KIA'S DESIGN FOR REMOVAL IS FLAWED. ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF MY DEALER SERVICE CONSULTANT YVES FERNANDEZ (321-951-9595), I SPOKE WITH \"ELVINA\" AT KIA CUSTOMER SERVICE DIRECTLY (2/14/2003   800-333-4542). ELVINA REFUSED TO HELP ME IN ANY WAY. SPECIFICALLY, SHE ALSO REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY COMPLAINT IN WRITING. THESE SEATS ARE DANGEROUS AND SHOULD BE FIXED TO MAKE THEM SAFER  AND EASIER TO REMOVE. CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS?   *NLM",
