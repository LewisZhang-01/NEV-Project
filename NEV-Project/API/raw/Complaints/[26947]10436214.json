I RARELY CARRY PASSENGERS, SO IT IS NOT DUE TO MISUSE. MY WIFE WAS SITTING IN THE BACK SEAT AND COULD NOT GET OUT. ALSO, IT NOW APPEARS THE FRONT PASSENGER HANDLE IS BEGINNING TO DETERIORATE. I HAVE CONTACTED THE FORD DEALERSHIP AND FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY DENY RESPONSIBILITY AND SAY IT IS OUTSIDE WARRANTY.   I BELIEVE THIS PROBLEM COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS.  *TR",
