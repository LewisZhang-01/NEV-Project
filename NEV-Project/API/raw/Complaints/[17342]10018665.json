LUCKILY MY HUSBAND GOT THE VEHICLE UNDER CONTROL AND OFF OF THE ROAD, MY ENTIRE FAMILY COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. WE LEARNED THAT IT WAS A TORSION BAR AND THAT THIS IS A COMMON DESIGN PROBLEM AND THAT THE DESIGN WAS CHANGED IN 1997. THEREFORE WE HAD TO REPLACE BOTH SIDES AT A COST OF OVER 1,000 DOLLARS. IT IS STILL MAKING A NOISE AND I DON'T FEEL IT IS RELIABLE.   *NLM",
