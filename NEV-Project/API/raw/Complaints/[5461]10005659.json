THE FUEL MILEAGE IS NOWHERE NEAR THE ADVERTISED MILEAGE. THE DEALER WAS CONTACTED REGARDING NO BRAKE LIGHTS JUST AFTER PURCHASE. AFTER TWO TRIPS TO THE DEALER (AND THE SERVICE WRITER TELLING US THAT WE REMOVED THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER ADAPTER WRONG), THEY DISCOVERED THE WIRING HARNESS FOR THE BACKUP LIGHTS WAS CRUSHED BY THE SHIFTER IN REVERSE AND SHORTED THE LIGHTS. AFTER COMPLAINING ABOUT POOR STARTING AND SHUDDERING AFTER A COLD SOAK, THE DEALER REPLACED THE INJECTOR O-RINGS, WHICH SOLVED THE SHUDDER, BUT NOT THE MILEAGE. NOTHING HAS HELPED THE OIL USAGE, NOT EVEN THE TWO TRIPS TO THE DEALER TO REPLACE A BAFFLE IN THE VALVE COVER AND AN \"OIL CONSUMPTION\" TEST, WHICH WE PERFORMED. YES, IT USES OIL. I SHOULD'VE BOUGHT MY DAUGHTER A NISSAN, OR, LIKE I JUST BOUGHT MYSELF, A BRAND NEW FORD PICKUP. THIS WAS MY FIRST AND LAST DAIMLER-CHRYSLER PRODUCT...EVER!",
