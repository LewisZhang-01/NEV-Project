THESE TIRES WOULD NOT HAVE MADE THE TRIP TO CHARLESTON 80 MILES AWAY AT THE FIRESTONE DEALER.  WE DID NOT KEEP THE TIRES.  I AM ONLY OFFERING THIS INFO AS A COURTESY TO THE REST OF THE PLANET, WHO MAY HAVE THE SAME TIRES.  FORTUNATELY FOR MY SON AND HIS FAMILY, HE ARRIVED FOR NEW YEAR'S WITHOUT INCIDENT. I HAVE PHOTOS OF THE FAULTY TIRE.  ALL TIRES WERE REPLACED. THE TIRE WAS SPLIT ABOUT 12 INCHES AROUND WHERE THE TREAD INTERFACED WITH THE SIDEWALL AND WAS SEPARATING.  I DID COMMUNICATE WITH FIRESTONE CONSUMER AFFAIRS, BUT SINCE I DIDN'T TAKE IT BACK TO A FIRESTONE DEALER, THERE WAS NOT MUCH THEY COULD DO FOR ME. MY HUSBAND FOLLOWED HIM TO THE DR. TIRE IN THE EVENT THERE WAS A PROBLEM. WE COULD NOT HAVE DRIVEN THE 80 MILES TO THE FIRESTONE DEALER. TS",
