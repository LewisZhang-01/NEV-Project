IF IT HAD BROKEN THEN, MY HUSBAND AND TWO DAUGHTERS (13, 15) WOULD HAVE MOST CERTAINLY BEEN KILLED.  HOWEVER, GOD SPARED US BECAUSE WE WERE ONLY GOING 30 MPH ON A SIDE STREET WHEN THE AXLE FAILED.  WHEN I REPORTED IT, FORD TOLD ME THAT THE REAR AXLE RECALL ( I HAD PERFORMED IN 2012) WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED.  ALSO, ANY PRIVATE MECHANICS I APPROACHED SAID IT WAS A FORD RECALL AND WOULD NOT PERFORM THE REPAIR.  SO, AT 137,000 MILES WE JUNKED THE VEHICLE AT A JUNK YARD BECAUSE WE COULDN'T GET IT REPAIRED.",
