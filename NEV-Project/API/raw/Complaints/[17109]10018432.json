        "summary": "WE BROUGHT OUR SATURN INTO THE OAKLAND, CA DEALER FOR A TRANSMISSION DIAGNOSIS.  AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION HAS DEVELOPED SOME LEAKS AND CLUTCH / GEAR ASSEMBLY PROBLEMS.  INITIAL QUOTE FROM THE DEALER SERVICE MANAGER FOR REPAIR IS $2600.00+.  EXTENDED WARRANTY EXPIRED 12/31/02, AND THE CAR IS CURRENTLY AT THE 94,904 MILE MARK.  AT THE 91,328 MILEAGE MARK, THE DEALER PERFORMED AN \"87,000 MILE\" SERVICE, NOT A \"90,000 MILE\" SERVICE.  WHY DIDN'T THE SERVICE ADVISOR INFORM MY DAUGHTER THAT THE \"90,000 MILE\" SERVICE WAS DUE, WHICH INCLUDED A TRANSMISSION SERVICE?  FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS APPEARS TO BE A CASE OF THIS DEALERSHIP NOT TRAINING THEIR SERVICE ADVISORS PROPERLY TO ADVISE A CUSTOMER REGARDING ROUTINE MAINTENANCE.  THE CAR IS CURRENTLY AT THE 94,904 MILE MARK, AND IT SEEMS REASONABLE THAT IF THE DEALER HAD PERFORMED THE \"90,000 MILE\" SERVICE WHEN THE CAR WAS AT THE 91,328 MILEAGE MARK AND INSPECTED THE TRANSMISSION THESE PROBLEMS WOULD HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND REPAIRED WHILE THE CAR STILL UNDER WARRANTY.  SATURN HAS ISSUED AT LEAST ONE DOZEN SERVICE BULLETINS REGARDING MAINTENANCE OF THIS TRANSMISSION SEVERAL TARGETED TO THE SPECIFIC ISSUE OF TRANSMISSION LEAKS AND REPAIRS.  DOES THIS SATURN DEALER HAVE A PATTERN OF NOT INFORMING FEMALE CUSTOMERS ABOUT RECOMMENDED MAINTENANCE?  IS THIS AN ISSUE AT OTHER SATURN DEALERS? IS THIS A CASE OF GENDER BIAS SINCE THE MALE SERVICE ADVISOR DID NOT COMMUNICATE THE FACTORY RECOMMENDATIONS TO A FEMALE CUSTOMER?   MAINTENANCE WORK BY THE SATURN OAKLAND (CA)DEALER:FUEL PUMP REPLACED, WATER PUMP REPLACED, WINDOW MECHANISMS REPLACED, DRIVE BELT REPLACED, IDLER PULLEY REPLACED, MOTOR MOUNTS REPLACED, ALTERNATOR REPLACED, THE POWER STEERING PUMP REPLACED.  WE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY COULD HAVE INSPECTED/DIAGNOSED/REPAIRED ALL THESE ITEMS AND NOT HAVE INCLUDED THE TRANSMISSION MAINTENANCE AT KEY MILEAGE MILESTONES.  *NLM",
