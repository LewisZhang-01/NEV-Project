MAZDA IS UNRESPONSIVE AND NOT HONORING MY BUY BACK REQUEST.  THEY SAID THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN FIXED, BUT THEY SAID THEY FIXED IT PREVIOUSLY AND IT WASN'T SO I HAVE NO FAITH I AM NOT WILLING TO RISK MY LIFE AGAIN.  WHY HASN'T THERE BEEN A RECALL?  I HAVE SEEN DOZEN OF OTHERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  *JB",
