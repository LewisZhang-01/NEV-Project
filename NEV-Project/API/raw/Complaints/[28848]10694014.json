THE DEALERSHIP STATED THIS WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER A WARRANTY AND ONLY THE POWER STEERING PUMP HAS BEEN RECALLED IF STEERING FAILS WHILE OPERATING THE VEHICLE.  THERE SEEMS TO BE SEVERAL COMPLAINTS REGARDING THIS ISSUE WITH THE 2011 GMC ACADIA.  PLEASE CONSIDER TAKING THE TIME TO INVESTIGATE THESE PARTICULAR COMPLAINTS.  IT VERY ALARMING TO BE INFORMED THAT A RECURRING ISSUE WILL NOT BE RESOLVED UNLESS THE POWER STEERING FAILS WHILE OPERATING THE VEHICLE.  IT'S ALSO CONCERNING THAT SEVERAL CONSUMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME ISSUE WITH POWER STEERING FLUID LEAKAGE AND MALFUNCTIONING STEERING GEAR/RACK.  THIS IS A CONSISTENT COMPLAINT AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION.   *TR",
