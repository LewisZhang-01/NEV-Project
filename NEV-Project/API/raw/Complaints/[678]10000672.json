HE THEN SLAMMED INTO A LARGE ROCK IN THE SIDE OF AN EIGHT FOOT BANK. THE VEHICLE THEN FLIPPED ONTO ITS SIDE AND SLID ANOTHER 20-30 FEET. OUR VEHICLE IS A 2003 FORD F250 AND NOW HAS $20,000.00 WORTH OF DAMAGE. WE TRIED TO DISCUSS THIS MATTER WITH A FEW OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE FORD DEALERSHIP WE INITIALLY BOUGHT IT AT. SOMEONE IN SERVICE TOLD US SOMETHING DEFINATLY DIDN'T LOOK RIGHT WITH THE STEERING. THE OWNER OF THE DEALERSHIP THEN TOLD US WE WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME PROVING THAT ANYTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF THE EXTENSIVE DAMAGE THAT IS NOW DONE TO THE VEHICLE. WE ALSO TRIED DISCUSSING THIS MATTER WITH OUR INSURANCE COMPANY. OUR INSURANCE ADJUSTOR TOLD US THAT THEY MOST LIKELY WOULD NOT PURSUE THE MATTER BECAUSE \"NO ONE WAS CRITICALLY INJURED OR KILLED\" IN THE ACCIDENT. HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT HE DID NOT EVEN TAKE A LOOK UNDER THE TRUCK TO SEE IF ANYTHING LOOKED OUT OF THE ORDINARY. MY HUSBAND STRONGLY FEELS THAT THIS ACCIDENT WAS NOT HIS FAULT. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE ELSE TO TURN FOR HELP. PLEASE HELP US!!",
