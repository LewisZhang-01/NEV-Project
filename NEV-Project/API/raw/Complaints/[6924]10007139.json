BY NO OTHER CHOICE....THAT IF I GET ON THE INTERSTATE (CAUSING THE RPM'S TO GO UP) FOR A FEW MILES, AND THEN EXIT THE INTERSTATE THE VALVES STOP RATTLING. EVERYONE I TALK TO SAYS THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. I HAVE LOOKED FOR HONDA SUPPORT EVERYWHERE! DEALERS CAN'T EVEN HELP! NOW I THINK I AM JUST GOING TO JOIN A GROUP THAT'S PLANNING A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT! MAYBE MR. HONDA CAN FIX THE PROBLEM THEN! IF NOT I WILL USE THE MONEY FROM THE LAWSUIT TO BUY A CHEVY...OR DODGE!ANYTHING BUT ANOTHER HONDA!.   *JB    ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS***768317",
