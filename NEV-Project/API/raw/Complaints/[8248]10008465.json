ENGINE HAD TO BE SHUT OFF TO PREVENT FATAL DAMAGE DUE TO ENGINE OVER REVVING AFTER BEING PUT INTO NEUTRAL.  NEW PROBLEM WAS POSED AS POWER BRAKES WERE NOT FUNCTIONAL ONCE ENGINE WAS OFF. ABLE TO FINALLY GET VEHICLE TO A SAFE STOP DUE TO LIGHT TRAFFIC.  CONTACTED NEARBY DEALERSHIP AND THEY SUGGESTED HITTING THE PEDAL TO BREAK LOOSE.  AFTER SEVERAL TRIES VEHICLE RETURNED TO NORMAL.  DROVE VERY CAUTIOUSLY HOME.   *JB",
