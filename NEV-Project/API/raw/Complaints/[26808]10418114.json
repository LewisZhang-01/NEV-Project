THE THROTTLE STUCK AT WHAT SEEM TO BE A WIDE OPEN POSITION, I HAD PASSED THE CAR AND LET OFF THE GAS AND PRESSED THE BRAKE 3 TIMES BEFORE FOR THE TRUCK STOPPED ACCELERATING AND I HAD REACHED A SPEED OF 95 MPH BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO GET THE TRUCK BACK UNDER CONTROL. IT SEEMED LIKE THE THROTTLE WAS STUCK FOR AROUND 10 SECONDS, WHICH WAS A VERY SCARY 10 SECONDS. I JUST FINISHED READING A FEW FORUMS WHERE THE DEALERSHIP SAID IT WAS THE RUBBER FLOOR MATS THAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM. WELL I HAVE NOT PUT FLOOR MATS IN MY TRUCK SO THAT WAS DEFIANTLY NOT THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.  *TR",
