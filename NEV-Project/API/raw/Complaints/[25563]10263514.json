TOOK THE DOOR PANEL APART AND FOUND THE POWER WINDOW REGULATOR CABLE WAS MANGLED AND IT HAD BROKEN FREE FROM ONE OF THE WINDOW SLIDES. WHEN I TRIED TO FIND THE PARTS ONLINE I CAME ACROSS A FORUM ON COMPLAINTS.COM. APPARENTLY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM, WITH THE SAME LOUD POP OR BANG WHICH IS VERY STARTLING AND COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. SEVERAL OF THE PEOPLE WROTE THAT THEY HAVE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM  WITH MORE THAN ONE DOOR AND EVEN SEVERAL TIMES WITH EACH DOOR. LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP TOLD ME IT IS BECAUSE OF THE HEAT IN LAS VEGAS AND THEY KEEP LOTS OF THEM IN STOCK BECAUSE IT IS A VERY COMMON FAILURE. I THINK IT IS MORE THAN THE HEAT THOUGH BECAUSE PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ARE REPORTING THE SAME PROBLEM. *TR",
