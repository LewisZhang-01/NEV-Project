I TRIED TO GET TO A REPAIR SHOP AND WITHIN A FEW MORE MILES OF DRIVING ALL GEARS STOPPED WORKING STRANDING ME IN TRAFFIC.  MY 2004 CAR HAS APPROX 120,000 MILES AND IS 3 YEARS AND 7 MONTHS OLD.  AS ITS NOT UNDER WARRANTY I TOWED TO A TRANSMISSION SHOP WHO SAY THE TRANSMISSION IS SHOT AND NEEDS REPLACING FOR $1,500.00.  IT LOOKS LIKE NOW ON THIS SITE THAT THERE MAY BE A TROUBLE WITH THIS ACCORD AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION?  CAN I BE REIMBURSED FOR THIS EXPENSE?   *JB",
