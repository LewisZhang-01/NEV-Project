THE PART HAS BEEN ON BACK ORDER FOR 3 WEEKS AND I AM NOW BEING TOLD IT WILL BE 2+ MORE WEEKS BEFORE I WILL HEAR ANYTHING, ALONG WITH  ALL OTHER GM CUSTOMERS IN THE COUNTRY THAT ARE WAITING FOR THIS PART. I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY CADILLAC THERE IS NO SPECIFIC DATE ON ITS ARRIVAL. SHOULD THIS NOT BE A RECALL ITEM IF THE PART IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS LONG? I AM NOT SURE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR IT AS OF YET. I AM TRYING TO FIND OUT WITH LITTLE HELP FROM CADILLAC.",
