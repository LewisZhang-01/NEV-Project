I DID NOT LEAVE THEN ON BECAUSE THEY GO OFF AFTER I HIT THE ALARM BUT APPARENTLY THEY ARE COMING BACK ON BY THEMSELVES. I SEE OTHER PEOPLE HAS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HYUNDAI AT ALL HOW MANY COMPLAINTS DO THEY NEED TO REALIZE THAT THEY MADE A HUGE MISTAKE MANUFACTURING THESE VECHICLES. I WILL NEVER BY ANYTHING THING HYUNDAI MAKES AGAIN.",
