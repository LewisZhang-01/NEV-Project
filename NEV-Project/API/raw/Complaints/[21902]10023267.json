        "summary": "THIS IS A GENERAL COMMENT THAT I HOPE WILL BE GIVEN SOME CONSIDERATION.  MY CAR AND MANY OTHERS SUFFER FROM MAJOR HEADLIGHT DIMMING CAUSED BY LEAKAGE AND DISCOLORATION OF THE NEWER PLASTIC COVERED HEADLAMPS.  REPLACEMENT IS DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE, BUT THE ALTERNATIVE IS SEVERELY REDUCED VISIBILITY AT NIGHT.  AS I HAVE AGED, I FIND REDUCED LIGHTING TO BE A MAJOR ISSUE IN NIGHT TIME DRIVING.  THE OLDER \"SEALED BEAM\" HEADLIGHTS WERE EASILY REPLACED IF DAMAGED - NOT SO WITH THE MODULAR DESIGNS.  THE SOLUTION IS NOT SIMPLE, BUT SOME ACCOUNTABILITY BY THE MANUFACTURER OR FORCED REPLACEMENT AT NOMINAL COST TO THE CAR OWNER MAY BE POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS.  I'M SURE YOU HAVE MANY OTHER ISSUES TO INVESTIGATE, BUT BELIEVE ME, ANY OF YOUR \"OLDER\" EMPLOYEES DRIVING MID-90'S OR OLDER CARS WILL CONFIRM THE PROBLEM, AND SIMPLE MATH MAKES IT A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE.    *JB",
