SEVERAL DAYS AGO, WE COULD NOT MOVE THE CAR AFTER WE STOPPED AT A LIGHT.  WE FINALLY HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED AT OUR EXPENSE AND FOUND OUT THAT THE WHOLE TRANSMISSION HAD BEEN \"BLOWN.\" (ONLY AFTER 40,000 MILES.)  WE FELT THAT OUR SAFETY WAS AT STAKE, SINCE NO WARNING SIGNS WITHIN THE VAN, TOLD US THAT THE PROBLEM EXISTED AND WE WERE AT A MAJOR INTERSECTION, WHICH COULD HAVE RESULTED IN SOME SERIOUS INJURIES.",
