POWER REDUCED.\"  WHEN DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEED ON A UPGRADE TOWING A SMALL TRAILER, THIS MESSAGE APPEARED AND THE SPEED OF THE CRV IMMEDIATELY REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY 20 MPH, ALMOST CAUSING AN ACCIDENT. I SHUT THE VEHICLE OFF AND WAITED (VERY SHAKEN) FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES AND RESTARTED THE CAR AND IT ACTED NORMALLY. THE DEALER DOESN'T SEEM TO KNOW WHY THIS HAPPENED EVEN THOUGH I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED BY THE REDUCTION IN SPEED. (AND IT HAS HAPPENED TO OTHERS WITH CRVS WHO HAVE REPORTED THIS ONLINE.) THIS CAR MOSTLY DRIVEN IN CANADA.",
