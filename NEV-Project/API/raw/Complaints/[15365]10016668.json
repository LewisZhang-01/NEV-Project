        "summary": "I AM HAVING A ISSUE WITH GM ON THE CHILD COMFORT GUIDES, OR LACK OF, ON OUR 2003 TRAILBLAZER.  ON PAGE 1-27 OF THE OWNERS MANUAL IT SHOWS A COMFORT GUIDE THAT IS SUPPOSE TO BE LOCATED IN A POCKET ON THE SIDE OF THE SEAT.  I HAVE TALKED TO 3 DEALERS AND A REP AT MY-GM LINK.  THE DEALERS DID THE BEST THAT WAS POSSIBLE BUT I FEEL THAT THE INFORMATION THE REP AT MY-GM LINK PROVIDED WOULD CAUSE A SAFETY HAZARD.  APPARENTLY GM HAS A KIT THAT COULD BE INSTALLED BY ATTACHING A BRACKET WITH A TETHER AND A CLIP THAT HOOKS AROUND THE SEAT BELT TO PROVIDE THE FUNCTION OF THE COMFORT GUIDE.  IF THIS TETHER IS IN PLACE IT WOULD BLOCK EXIT FROM THE REAR SEATS BECAUSE IT CONNECTS TO THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE AND WOULD STRETCH ACROSS THE EXIT ONCE THE MIDDLE SEAT IS FOLDED DOWN, AND COULD POSSIBLY BE A TRIP HAZARD.  WE HAVE TWO YOUNG CHILDREN AND THE BELT GOES RIGHT ACROSS THEIR FACE AND CAUSES A PROBLEM WHEN THEY KEEP TRYING TO PLACE THE SHOULDER STRAP BEHIND THEIR BACK.  I FEEL THIS COMFORT GUIDE IS ESSENTIAL IN PROVIDING SAFETY FOR YOUNG AND SHORT PASSENGERS.  THE CASE NUMBER WITH GM IS 1-94348313.  I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HELP WITH THIS MATTER.   *JB",
