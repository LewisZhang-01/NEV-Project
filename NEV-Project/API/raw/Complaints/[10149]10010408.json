THE FLOOR MAT HAD COME LOOSE AND JAMMED THE ACCELERATOR. I HAD TO SHIFT TO AND KICK THE PEDAL LOOSE. VERY NEARLY CAUSED A MAJOR ACCIDENT. THIS FAULT WAS THE SUBJECT OF AN EARLIER RECALL, BUT THE SOLUTION BY NISSAN DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THE FLOOR MAT EASILY COMES OFF THE PUNY LITTLE PEG ON THE FLOOR.   *JB",
