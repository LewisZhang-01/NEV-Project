THIS HAPPENED AGAIN AS I WAS TAKING MY WIFE TO THE AIRPORT.   THE VEHICLE WILL BEGIN TO SHAKE VIOLANTLY WHEN I APPLY THE BRAKES AT AROUND 60 TO 65 MPH.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THAT THE ROTORS ARE WARPED, AND I SHOULD GET NEW BRAKES WITH NEW ROTORS.  I INFORMED THE INDIVIDUAL THAT THE VEHICLE HAD JUST HAD ITS YEARLY STATE INSPECTION DONE BY THEM IN MARCH OF 2012  THIS WAS EARLY AUGUST 2012 AND THE VEHICLE HAD ONLY BEEN DRIVEN LESS THEN 2000 MILES.   A CHECK ON THE INTERNET SHOWS THAT THE IMPLA IS PRONE TO WARPED BRAKE ROTORS.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFTEY ISSUE. *TR",
