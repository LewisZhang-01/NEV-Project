AS FAR AS I KNOW TOYOTA HAS A LARGE RECALL NOW ON RAV 4S AND LEXUS VEHICLES DUE TO EXCESSIVE FRAME RUST BUT THERE IS NO CURRENT RECALL ON 4 RUNNERS. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD MY CONCERN IN HOPES OF LEADING TO A RECALL ON 4 RUNNERS BUILT DURING SIMILAR TIME PERIOD. ACCORDING TO TOYOTA THEY SAY THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM THEY ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS. BUT THEY HAVE FAILED TO RECALL THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE DANGEROUS. WHEN THE FRAME BREAKS, THIS IS A DEADLY SITUATION WHILE DRIVING. TOYOTA OFFERED ME NO FORM OF REIMBURSEMENT WHEN I REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO THEIR CORPORATE OFFICE(TOYOTA CASE #[XXX]) FILED WITH TOYOTA OVER PHONE ON 9-25-14.      INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
