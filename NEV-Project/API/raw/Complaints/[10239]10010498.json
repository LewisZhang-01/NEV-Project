IT HAS BEEN THIS WAY SINCE THE DAY I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE, AND THE DEALER SAYS THIS IS \"NORMAL\".  THE TRUCK WILL WANDER ALL OVER THE LANE, AND WHEN I TRY TO CORRECT IT, GOES COMPLETELY THE OTHER WAY, AND THIS TO ME IS DANGEROUS.  THERE IS LOTS OF PLAY IN THE STEERING WHEEL, AND AGAIN THE DEALER TELLS ME THIS IS \"NORMAL\".   *NLM",
