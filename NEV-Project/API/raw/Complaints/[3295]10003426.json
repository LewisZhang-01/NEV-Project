        "summary": "CAR WAS RUNNING ROUGH, SMELLED BAD, AND WAS CONSIDERED UN-DRIVABLE BY MY DEALER. VW TOWED THE CAR IN. IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES, MY DEALER INFORMED ME THAT ONE COIL PACK HAD FAILED AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO ORDER THE PART. I ASKED IF THEY COULD JUST REPLACE ALL 6 OF THE COIL PACKS AS THERE SEEMS TO BE A HISTORY OF THEM FAILING. DEALER SAID VW WOULD NOT APPROVE SUCH A PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE ACTION. THEY ALSO TOLD ME THE PART WAS ON A NATIONAL BACKORDER AND THEY DID NOT KNOW WHEN THEY WOULD RECEIVE IT. I WAS PROVIDED $25/DAY FOR A RENTAL CAR. I'M NOT TOO UPSET WITH THE HANDLING OF THIS ONE INCIDENT, BUT I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT THERE ARE ARGUABLY 5 OTHER 'TIME BOMBS' IN MY CAR WAITING TO FAIL AND LEAVE ME STRANDED IN A MUCH LESS CONVIENENT MANNER THAN THIS FIRST FAILURE. WITH SUCH A HIGH NUMBER OF COIL PACK FAILURES IN VW'S LINE [BOTH THE 1.8TURBO AND THE VR6], I WISH VW WOULD ISSUE A RECALL ONCE THE PART SUPPLY IS AVAILABLE. THIS PROBLEM ALONG WITH A CHRONIC WARM-START STALLING ISSUES HAS RESULTED IN ME NOT BEING ABLE TO RECOMMEND VW TO MY PALS.",
