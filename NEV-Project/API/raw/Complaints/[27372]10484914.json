        "summary": "MY 17 YR OLD DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING OUR 2008 DODGE CALIBER WHEN ACCELERATION WAS LOST.  THE CAR STARTED SHAKING WHEN SHE TRIED TO GIVE IT FUEL AND THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE SYSTEM LIKE CAME ON.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, SHE WAS VERY SHAKEN BY THIS ORDEAL.  WE HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT WE PURCHASED THROUGH CARMAX, WITH A 300.00 DEDUCTIBLE, HOWEVER THE WARRANTY COMPANY WOULD ONLY PAY 144.00 DOLLARS OF THE 647.00 TOTAL BILL.  THE CAR HAS APPROX 70,000 MILES SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE THROTTLE SYSTEM WOULD BE DEFECTIVE.  ACCORDING TO THE REPAIR SHOP, THE NEEDLE INSIDE THE THROTTLE THAT FEEDS THE FUEL WAS DEFECTIVE. LUCKILY MY DAUGHTER WAS NOT ON THE MAIN HIGHWAY WHEN IT WENT OUT, OTHERWISE IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE SERIOUS.  I AM VOICING MY COMPLAINT ON THIS PART AND ALL BE WARE OF THE THROTTLE NEEDLE GOING BAD.  I WILL ALSO MAKE THIS A FORMAL COMPLAINT WITH DODGE AS WELL.  *TR",
