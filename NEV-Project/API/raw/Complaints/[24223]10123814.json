WHEN THE CAR IS STARTED AND THE CAR IS PLACED IN REVERSE, THE VEHICLE BEGINS TO BUCK VIOLENTLY. IF I WAS PARALLEL PARKED, I WOULD HAVE HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME AND IN BACK OF ME OR POSSIBLY A PERSON. I KNOW FOR SURE THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS SAME DANGEROUS PROBLEM AS I HAVE SEEN IT ON AUDI MESSAGE BOARDS. THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW. NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT TO DO SINCE THE SITUATION IS HARD TO REPEAT AT WILL.",
