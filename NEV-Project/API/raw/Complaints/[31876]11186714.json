JUST LIKE OTHERS HAVE REPORTED, IT COMES ON WHEN I'M DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY & JUST DIES, YOU CAN'T STEER THE CAR OR ANYTHING.  OR YOU GO TO ACCELERATE AND IT DIES & YOU ALMOST GET REAR-ENDED.  I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW MANY REPORTS ARE ON HERE SIMILAR TO MINE AND THERE HAS BEEN NO RECALL ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS ONE FOR THE 2016 PATRIOT.  WHAT WILL IT TAKE, SOMEONE DYING?  THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE WHEN YOUR CAR WILL JUST DIE WHILE DRIVING 65-70 MPH & YOU CAN'T STEER OR ANYTHING!",
