        "summary": "IN OCTOBER OF 2008 THE CAR STARTED JERKING REALLY HARD WHEN SHIFTING BETWEEN 1 AND 2ND GEARS. MAINLY WHEN I WAS SLOWING DOWN TO TAKE A TURN OR WHEN APPROACHING A LIGHT AND THEN TRIED TO ACCELERATE. DEALER SAID THAT I NEEDED TO REPLACE TRANSMISSION OR HAVE IT REBUILT. I HAD THE TRANSMISSION REBUILT IN JANUARY 2009 PROBLEM WAS GONE FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN BEGAN AGAIN ABOUT ONCE A WEEK. WITH TIME THE PROBLEM THE SHIFTING KEPT GETTING HARDER AND HARDER. FEBRUARY 2010 THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. NOW THE CAR WILL SOMETIMES JERK REALLY HARD AND MAKE A REALLY LOUD CLANKING NOISE WHEN SHIFTING. WHEN IT DOES THIS THE CAR ACTS LIKE IT DOES NOT WANT TO ACCELERATE. WHEN CAR IS DRIVEN FOR A FEW MINUTES, THEN TURNED OFF AND THEN TURNED ON AGAIN THEN THE NOISE IS GONE AND CAR ACCELERATES JUST FINE. PROBLEM OCCURS ABOUT EVERY OTHER DAY. WHEN TAKEN TO THE DEALER THEY SAID IT WAS THE SHIFT SOLENOID THAT'S RELATED TO THE TRANSMISSION. *TR",
