WHEN IT DOES FINALLY SHIFT INTO GEAR, IT IS VERY HARD AND JOLTING.  73,000 MILES ON THE CAR AND IT WAS PURCHASED NEW. I'M BEING TOLD BY THE FORD DEALERSHIP THAT THE TRANSMISSION WILL HAVE TO BE \"OVERHAULED\" AT A COST OF $1500-MINIMUM. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A HISTORY OF THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM WITH THE 2002 FORD EXPLORER. IS THE NHTSA LOOKING INTO IT?*JB",
