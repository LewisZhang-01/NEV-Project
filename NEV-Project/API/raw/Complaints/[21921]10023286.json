WHO IS/WAS THE APPROVING GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY FOR THESE NEWER/BRIGHTER HEADLIGHTS AND; IN THAT THESE HEADLIGHTS TEND TO, IN EFFECT, BLIND MANY DRIVERS, WHY ARE THEY STILL BEING USED??  THIS, OF COURSE DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE COSTS INVOLVED IN RE-STRIPING OR RE-MARKING MANY OF OUR ROADS.  THE OLDER HEADLIGHTS WORKED JUST FINE AND DID NOT RESULT IN THE BLINDING OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC UNLESS THE HIGH-BEAMS WERE ON.  HOW MANY HEADLIGHT-RELATED ACCIDENTS MUST THERE BE BEFORE THESE 'NEWER, BETTER' HEADLIGHTS ARE FINALLY REMOVED FROM THE MARKET AND OUTLAWED?  *NLM",
