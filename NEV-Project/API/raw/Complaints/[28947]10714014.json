AFTER LOOKING ONLINE IT SEEMS TO BE A COMMON ISSUE OF AN EXPOSED JOINT IN THE STEERING SHAFT RUSTING AND BINDING UP. JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE. EXTREMELY POOR DESIGN OF THIS PART.  I NO LONGER WILL TAKE MY FAMILY IN THIS TRUCK AND WILL BE LOOKING TO TRADE IN FOR A DIFFERENT VEHICLE. TOYOTA NEEDS TO ISSUE A RECALL TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM AND PROTECT ITS CUSTOMERS.  *TR",
