        "summary": "DRIVING ON 2 LANE HIGHWAY WITH MY 3 KIDS IN THE VAN.  THE BATTERY LIGHT COMES ON AND I HEAR A FEW BRIEF CLUNKS FROM ENGINE AREA.  THEN I REALIZE I HAVE NO POWER STEERING SO I STOP QUICKLY AT A SAFE SPOT.  I LOOK AT THE ENGINE AND SEE THE ACCESSORY BELT THAT DRIVES POWER STEERING PUMP, ALTERNATOR, AND A/C IS LOOSE.  I SEE THAT THE OUTER RING ON THE CRANKSHAFT PULLEY IS MISSING AND ONLY SEE RUBBER ON ITS OUTSIDE.  IT'S OVER 100 DEG.F OUTSIDE AND WE'RE 10 MILES FROM ANYTHING.  I CALL A FEW TOWING COMPANIES AND FIND ONE THAT CAN SHOW UP WITHIN AN HOUR.  WE WAIT AND ALSO GET A HOLD OF A FRIEND TO PICK US UP AFTER THE TOW TRUCK SHOWS UP.  THEY TOW IT TO OUR LOCAL HONDA DEALER.  THE DEALER REPLACES THE CRANKSHAFT PULLEY AND DRIVE BELT.  TOWING WAS $153.40 AND REPAIR AT DEALER WAS $349.56.  LOSING POWER STEERING ON NARROW TWO LANE HIGHWAY GOING 55 MPH IS UNSAFE AND THE CRANKSHAFT PULLEY SHOULD NOT FAIL EVEN AT 111K MILES.  I HAVE OWNED THE VAN SINCE NEW AND HAVE ALL PROPER MAINTENANCE DONE (PREVENTIVELY REPLACED ACCESSORY BELT BEFORE AND TIMING BELT AND WATER PUMP).  *KB",
