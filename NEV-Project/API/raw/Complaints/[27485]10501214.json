I HAD THE OIL CHANGED AND TRANSMISSION FLUSHED, AND IT SEEMED OK, ALTHOUGH IT WAS STILL DOING THE SHUDDERING.  YESTERDAY I NOTICED A STRANGE PUDDLE ON THE GARAGE FLOOR, SO I CHECKED IT OUT.  THERE IS A LEAK THAT IS CAUSING COOLANT TO LEAK INTO THE TRANSMISSION.  I BEGAN DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT THIS IS APPARENTLY A FAIRLY COMMON PROBLEM IN 2005-2010 NISSANS.  I NEVER RECEIVED ANY NOTICE OF THE WARRANTY EXTENSION.  WHEN I CALLED THE LOCAL NISSAN DEALER, THE SERVICE GUY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN I DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM, AND ESTIMATED THAT TO REPAIR WOULD BE $4000-5000.  *TR",
