I TOOK TO MY TOYOTA DEALER THEY CONFIRMED AND INSPECTED MY TRUCK. THEY TOLD ME IT WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE. I CALLED TOYOTA CUSTOMER CARE THEY TOLD ME MY VEHICLE WAS NOT COVERED AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY WOULD DO. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY WON'T COVER THIS FAILURE. IF THEY ARE ONLY BUILDING VEHICLES TO LAST 11 YEARS, THEY SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN. NOW MY SON HAS A TRUCK HE CAN'T DRIVE! GREAT FIRST CAR HUH? I THINK IT'S TOYOTA DOESN'T CARE CENTER. ANY HELP WOULD BE APPRECIATED. *JB",
