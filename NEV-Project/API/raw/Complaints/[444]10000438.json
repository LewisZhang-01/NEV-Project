THE PROBLEM WITH MY TRANSMISSION WAS THAT THE SPLINES OF THE FRONT PLANETARY STRIPPED BECAUSE THEY WERE MADE WITH A SOFTER METAL THAN THE UNDERDRIVE CLUTCH HUB.  I FEEL THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW THAT DAIMLER CHRYSLER SHOULD ADDRESS.  WHEN I CONTACTED DAIMLER CHRYSLER, I WAS TOLD THE PROBLEM WAS MY FAULT, BECAUSE I HAD NOT CHANGED THE TRANSMISSION FLUID AT THE RECOMMENDED SERVICE INTERVAL, AND I WAS 22,000 MILES OUTSIDE OF WARRANTY. HOWEVER, THERE IS NOT A TRANSMISSION FLUID I AM AWARE OF THAT WILL MAKE THOSE SPLINES STRONGER. TS",
