PADS, ROTORS, CALIPERS, AND BALL JOINTS HAVE ALL BEEN REPLACED - PADS AND ROTORS AS OFTEN AS EVERY 6000 TO 12000 MILES.  DEALERS AND INDEPENDENTS HAVE WORKED ON IT WITH THE SAME RESULT:  MORE FAILURES.  THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS FOR MALIBU'S JUST FROM THIS YEAR'S MODEL AND MANY MORE FOR OTHER YEARS.  NHTSA HAS NEVER INVESTIGATED EVEN THOUGH BRAKE FAILURE WOULD SEEM TO BE SIGNIFICANT.  MY TAX MONEY IS NOT WORKING HARD ENOUGH. *JB",
