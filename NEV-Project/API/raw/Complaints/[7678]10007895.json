IT IS NECESSARY TO IMMEDIATELY BRAKE, AS VISION IS 100% OBSTRUCTED.  THIS HAS HAPPENED ON 3 DIFFERENT DAYS.  TWICE IT WAS DURING  HEAVY RAIN, WHERE WATER WAS POOLING BY THE CURB, BUT WAS NOT YET  OVER THE CURB.  ONCE IT WAS DURING DRY WEATHER, BUT THERE WAS A DEEP  PUDDLE OF WATER IN A LOW SPOT IN THE ROAD.  IN ALL 3 SITUATIONS IT POSED A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY HAZARD, AS WE COULD NOT REACT TO TRAFFIC SITUATIONS AHEAD OF US AND HAD TO COME TO A STOP UNTIL THE WINDSHIELD DRAINED.  THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WERE OVERWHELMED BY THE AMOUNT OF WATER THROWN ON THE WINDSHIELD.",
