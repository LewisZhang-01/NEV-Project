THIS ALLOWS THE SEAT TO ROCK BACK (IN A ROCKING MOTION) WHEN PUSHING AGAINST THE SEAT BACK.  THIS HAPPENS WHEN GETTING IN THE CAR, CHANGING POSITIONS IN THE SEAT, AND EVEN UNDER HARD ACCELERATION.  THE DEALER REPLACED THE SEAT TRACK UNDER WARRANTY.  THAT DIDN'T SOLVE IT.  THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE AT THE DEALER TOLD ME THIS WAS NOT AN UNCOMMON  PROBLEM.  IT STARTED AS SOON AS WE GOT THE CAR (PURCHASED NEW) AND IT'S NEVER STOPPED.  *JB",
