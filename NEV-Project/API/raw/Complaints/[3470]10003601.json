        "summary": "ON JANUARY 19, RETURNING HOME FROM A FAMILY TRIP, THE THROTTLE ON OUR 1999 A6 STUCK OPEN AT 65MPH. I WAS TRAPPED IN THE LEFT LANE OF A 4 LANE HIGHWAY WITH NO SHOULDER TO PULL ONTO DUE TO HEAVY SNOW ACCUMULATION. I HAD STAND ON THE BRAKES AS HARD AS I COULD TO AVOID SMASHING INTO THE VEHICLES AHEAD OF ME THAT STARTED TO SLOW DOWN FOR AN UPCOMING SPEED ZONE. I OVERHEATED MY BRAKES ALMOST TO THE POINT OF FAILURE IN ORDER TO PULL INTO THE RIGHT LANE AND MAKE A QUICK EXIT WHERE I TURNED OFF THE KEY. MY BRAKES SMOKED AND SMELLED FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES IN ZERO TEMPERATURES. AFTER LETTING IT SIT FOR A WHILE I TRIED TO START IT AGAIN AND IT IMMEDIATELY REDLINED. WE WERE EVENTUALLY ABLE TO RESTART AND DRIVE THE CAR HOME AT A VERY SLOW AND CAUTIOUS PACE USING BACK ROADS. THIS WAS A TERRIFYING AND VERY DANGEROUS, LIFE THREATENING SITUATION FOR MY SELF AND MY FAMILY.   FOUR DAYS AFTER THE \"REPAIR\" AT JOHN HOLTZ AUDI THE THROTTLE AGAIN FROZE WHEN MY WIFE HAD TO SLOW FOR A STOPPING SCHOOL BUS. THE EXACT SAME SYMPTOMS OCCURED.   I AM A MEMBER OF THE AUDI QUATRO CLUB. THROUGH MY EXPOSURE TO MANY OTHER AUDI OWNERS I HAVE LEARNED THAT THIS PROBLEM IS FAIRLY COMMON IN VERY COLD WEATHER AND THE AUDI SOLUTION OF CLEANING THE THROTTLE BODY DOES NOT PREVENT THE PROBLEM FROM RECURRING. THE AUTHORIZED AUDI MECHANIC WHO WORKED ON MY CAR IN ROCHESTER USED TO WORK IN VERMONT. HE TOLD ME THAT THE PROBLEM WAS OFTEN SEEN THERE, BUT INFREQUENT IN ROCHESTER, NY. HE WAS RELCUCTANT TO DISCUSS THE SITUATION EXTENSIVELY, SAYING\" I HAVE TOO MANY YEARS IN.\" A FRIEND OF MINE IS AN AFTERMARKET AUDI SPECIALIST WHO HAS DOCUMENTED THIS PROBLEM REPEATEDLY. ART MAYHEW CAN BE REACHED AT 315 429 9902   THE AUDI CUSTOMER RELATIONS REFERRAL # IS 030031445",
