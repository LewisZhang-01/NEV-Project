IF YOU ARE TURNING TO THE RIGHT YOU CAN EASILY TURN THE VEHICLE, HOWEVER, LEFT HAND TURNS ARE IMPOSSIBLE.  THE DEALERSHIP MAKING THE REPAIR AGREED TO PAY 1/2 OF THE COST BECAUSE THEY AGREED THE PART WAS FAULTY AND NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED THE FIRST TIME LET ALONE TWICE.  GM, HOWEVER, REFUSED TO PAY FOR EITHER OF THE REPAIRS AND WOULD NOT STAND BEHIND THEIRS .  *NLM",
