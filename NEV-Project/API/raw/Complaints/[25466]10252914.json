THE VEHICLE CONTINUED TO STOP AND GO UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO CROSS 2 LANES OF TRAFFIC TO EXIT TO THE SHOULDER. VEHICLE WAS TURNED OFF AND RESTARTED AT WHICH TIME THE BAS ESP MALFUNCTION INDICATOR LAMP ILLUMINATED. SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE RESULTED IN THE SAME STOP AND GO ACTION. AFTER TURNING THE VEHICLE OFF AND ON SEVERAL TIMES THE STOP AND GO ACTION CEASED BUT THE VEHICLE FELT AS THOUGH IT WAS PULLING A HEAVY LOAD. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE HOME IN THIS CONDITION. THE NEXT DAY I STARTED THE VEHICLE AND NO MALFUNCTION CODES WERE DISPLAYED. I DROVE THE VEHICLE AROUND THE BLOCK WITHOUT INCIDENT. I THEN DROVE THE VEHICLE ON SOME ERRANDS AND, AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, THE STOP AND GO ACTION STARTED AGAIN AS I WAS ACCELERATING FROM A TRAFFIC SIGNAL ABOUT 600 YARDS FROM THE MERCEDES REPAIR SHOP. I LEFT THE VEHICLE WITH THE REPAIR SHOP AND HE CALLED A FEW HOURS LATER TO SAY IT NEEDED A YAW SENSOR. *TR",
