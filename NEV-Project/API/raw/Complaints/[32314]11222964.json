I TURNED MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS ON AND INITIALLY THEY WORKED FINE AND THEN SUDDENLY THEY STOPPED IN THE UPRIGHT POSITION. I HAD ZERO VISIBILITY AND HAD TO PULL OVER BENEATH AN OVERPASS UNTIL THE RAIN STOPPED.   NEEDLESS TO SAY, THIS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN AS THE RISK FOR ACCIDENT AND/OR INJURY THAT COULD COME ABOUT BECAUSE OF THIS IS HIGH.   WHEN DOING AN ONLINE SEARCH ABOUT THIS, I FOUND NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME SITUATION. THIS APPEARS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM AMONG EQUINOX VEHICLES. WHY HAS THIS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED? WHY SHOULD CONSUMERS HAVE TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT CLEARLY BEGAN AT THE FACTORY.",
