NOW WHEN WE ARE  DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT THE SPEED LIMIT OF 65 MPH, TRANSMISSION SLIPS BACK INTO 2ND GEAR AND MAKES A GRINDING NOISE. THE TACHOMETER GROWS UP AND DOWN. SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT EVEN GO OUT OF 2ND TO ACCELERATE. I DO NOT FEEL LIKE THIS IS A VERY \"SAFE\" VEHICLE TO HAVE ANYMORE. AND ALL THE DEALERSHIPS STATE THERE IS NO RECALL. HOWEVER MANY OF THE PEOPLE WE KNOW WITH THE SAME VEHICLE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. *AK",
