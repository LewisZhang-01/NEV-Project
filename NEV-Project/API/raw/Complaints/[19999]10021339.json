        "summary": "PULLING INTO DRIVEWAY, THE TRUCK SHUT OFF.  IT STARTED BACK, BUT SEEMED TO HESITATE WHEN TRYING TO ACCELERATE.  THE FOLLOWING DAY, THE TRUCK CONTINUED TO HESITATE.  I ADDED TRANSMISSION FLUID AND TOOK A \"TEST DRIVE\" IN THE DRIVEWAY TO SEE IF IT CONTINUED TO HESITATE.  IT DID NOT, BUT I NOTICED FLUID LEAKING OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE TRUCK (THE TRANSMISSION FLUID I HAD JUST PUT IN).  I HAD TO CALL A ROLL-BACK TO TOW IT TO A MECHANIC.  HE SAID IT TOOK HIM A DAY AND A HALF JUST TO REMOVE THE TRANSMISSION.  HE NOTICED METAL SHAVINGS IN THE TRANSMISSION FLUID.  HE WAS UNABLE TO REMOVE THE TORQUE CONVERTER AT ALL. IT WAS COMPLETELY STUCK.  THIS TRUCK HAS ONLY 50,100 MILES AT THE TIME OF THIS REPAIR.  WE HAD TO HAVE A NEW TRANSMISSION, AND TRANSMISSION COOLER, TOTALLING $3,061.19 IN REPAIRS.  I CALLED THE DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM, AND NO ONE RETURNED MY CALL.  I CALLED THE DAIMLERCHRYSLER CORP.  AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY WOULD DO.  *AK",
