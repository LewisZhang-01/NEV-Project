I HAVE CALLED BMW SEVERAL TIMES TO GET A STATUS AND THEY HAVE, ON EACH OCCASION, TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE NOT YET ABLE TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEMS.  IT IS NOW 10 MONTHS LATER.  IT SEEMS THAT THIS IS LONGER THAN ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT FOR ITEMS THAT DEMAND WRITTEN NOTIFICATION OF DEFECTS.  SO, I AM WRITING TO ASK YOU TO ASSIST IN GETTING THESE RECALL ITEMS ADDRESSED.    THANK YOU.",
