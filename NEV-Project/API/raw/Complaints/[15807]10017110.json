KNOW AT 60000 MILE IT SHAKES AGAIN PULLING LIKE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES ACTIVATED.  IT IS VERY SERIOUS SHAKING AND IF NOT PREPARED COULD AND PROBABLY HAS CAUSED ACCIDENTS.  TOOK JEEP IN FOR UNRELATED SERVICE AND THEY TOLD ME THAT JEEP HAS COME OUT WITH NEW ROTORS FOR THIS PROBLEM AND THAT IT WOULD COST ME $407.00 DOUBLE WHAT REGULAR ROTOR WOULD COST??  I WANT TO KNOW IF SOMEONE CAN HELP EXPLAIN WHY THEY ARE NOT BACKING THEIR PRODUCT IF THEY KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM?  THEY OBVIOUSLY KNOW THIS OTHER WISE WHY ARE THEY TRYING TO SELL ME ANOTHER PRODUCT TO FIX THEIR DEFECTIVE PRODUCT.  I HAVE HEARD AND READ MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT JEEPS AND THE BRAKE ROTOR PROBLEMS KNOW AFTER CHECKING THIS  OFFICE'S COMPLAINT FILES.  SOME ONE PLEASE POINT ME TO WHOM I SHOULD TALK TO.  I AM IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT FIELD AND HAVE NEVER HAD A VEHICLE SHAKE WHILE BRAKING LIKE THIS BEFORE IS JEEP NOT  BACKING IT'S VEHICLES??    *NLM",
