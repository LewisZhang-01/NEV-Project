I WILL HAVE MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND THE CAR WILL SURGE AS IF I AM PRESSING ON THE ACCELERATOR.  WHEN I AM DRIVING, IT SURGES AS IF I AM PRESSING THE GAS PEDAL UP AND DOWN, ALTHOUGH MY FOOT REMAINS STEADY.  I COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT I TOOK MY VEHICLE IN AND EACH TIME I HAVE AN OIL CHANGE.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THERE IS NOT A PROBLEM.  I THINK THAT THERE MUST BE MORE TO THE TOYOTA RECALL BECAUSE MY VEHICLE THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE RECALL APPEARS TO BE HAVING SIMILAR ISSUES.  I COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS LONG BEFORE THIS RECALL WAS ANNOUNCED. *TR",
