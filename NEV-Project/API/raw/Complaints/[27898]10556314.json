THE VISOR SPLIT OPEN AND A BUNCH OF LITTLE PLASTIC PIECES INSIDE WERE BROKEN. I TOOK IT TO THE MECHANIC AND THE PART COSTS $45 AND LUCKILY I'M NOT BEING CHARGED A SERVICE FEE. I WANTED TO REPORT THIS BECAUSE I HAVE READ A LOT ABOUT IT ONLINE AND IT'S NOT FAIR THAT THE MANUFACTURER USES SUCH CHEAP PARTS THAT WILL MELT OR BREAK.  *TR",
