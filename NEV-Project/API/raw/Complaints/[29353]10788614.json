THE CAR CONTINUED TO FUNCTION ON LITHIUM ION BATTERY WITH EPC AND BATTERY ICONS LIT,  UNTIL THE CHARGE WENT TO ZERO AND ALL ELECTRICAL FUNCTIONS INCLUDING GAUGES CEASED. THE CAR WAS DEAD BUT ROLLING. I HAD A QUARTER MILE WITH NO TRAFFIC IN FRONT OF ME TO STOP, LUCKILY I DID 15 FEET BEFORE A RED LIGHT AT AN INTERSECTION. AFTER MISSING TWO LIGHTS I WAS ABLE TO RESTART AND DRIVE WITH DIMINISHED PERFORMANCE (LITTLE POWER) TO MY DEALERSHIP THAT WAS 1 MILE AWAY. THIS IS NOT HOW MY SERVICE INVOICE WAS WRITTEN UP. IN WRITING THEY PUT \"STALLED AT LIGHT\". I AM ATTACHING AN EMAIL FROM THE SERVICE MANAGER STATING THAT NO PROBLEMS COULD BE FOUND.",
