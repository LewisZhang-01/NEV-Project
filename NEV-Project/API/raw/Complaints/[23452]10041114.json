THE DEALER FOUND THE FAILED AND MELTED PLUG TO VOLTAGE REGULATOR AND BURNT WIRING. FIRST, THE DEALER REPLACED AT THE COST OF $150.00.  THE PARTS WORKED FOR ABOUT 6 MOS/500 MILES.  SECOND, THE PREVIOUSLY MELTED PLUG WIRING COMPLETELY FRIED.  YAMAHA MADE A REPAIR KIT THAT DOES NOT FIT OR WORK PROPERLY, TABS ON CLIPS DO NOT HOLD IN HOUSING. SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO HAVE THE PART(S) RECALLED BY YAMAHA WITH NO SUCCESS.  YAMAHA SAID THAT THIS IS A WARRANTY ISSUE NOT A SAFETY ISSUE. THERE ARE 3 (THREE), TO MY KNOWLEDGE, IN MY TOWN THAT ARE EXPERIENCING THESE SAME ISSUES.  *LA",
