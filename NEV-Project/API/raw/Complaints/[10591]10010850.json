        "summary": "IN 2001 WE PURCHASED A NEW CHEVROLET MALIBU.  AFTER JUST 17,000 MILES WE WERE INFORMED IT WOULD NOT PASS A SAFETY INSPECTION BECAUSE THE BRAKES HAD WORN OUT.  GM REPLACED THE BRAKES FOR US.  13,000 MILES LATER THE SAME THING HAPPENED.  AFTER MUCH COMPLAINING AND LETTER WRITING, GM REPLACED THE BRAKES AGAIN.  I INSPECTED THE BRAKES IN BOTH INSTANCES AND NOTICED THAT ONLY THE INNER BRAKE PAD WAS WORN, THE OUTER PAD LOOKED BRAND NEW.    THE CALIPER IS CAST ALUMINUM AND IT BENDS WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED MUCH LIKE A CHEAP \"C\" CLAMP THAT YOU MIGHT FIND IN A DOLLAR STORE.  THERE ARE TWO MAJOR CONCERNS I HAVE ABOUT THIS CONDITION.  FIRST AND FOREMOST IS THE SAFETY OF THIS SYSTEM.  WITH THE CONSTANT FLEXING I AM CONCERNED THAT THE CALIPER MAY FRACTURE AT SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD.    IN ADDITION TO THE FLEXING, I BELIEVE THE INNER PAD IS OVERHEATING, SINCE IT IS DOING ALL OF THE WORK, AND THIS COULD CAUSE BRAKE FADE.   THE CALIPER ALSO APPEARS TO BIND ON THE GUIDE PINS WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED.  WHEN THE CASTING BENDS, IT CAUSES A MISALIGNMENT OF THE GUIDE PINS AND CONSEQUENTLY THE CALIPER THEN BINDS.  THE SECOND ISSUE I HAVE IS WITH THE LIFE OF THE BRAKES.  GM SAYS THE BRAKES SHOULD ONLY LAST BETWEEN 8,000 AND 12,000 MILES.  IF THE CALIPER DIDN'T FLEX AS MUCH AND THE PADS WERE WEARING EVENLY THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF THE BRAKES WOULD GO UP SIGNIFICANTLY.  IN EITHER CASE GM BLEW IT WITH THEIR CHOICE OF THESE CALIPERS ON THIS VEHICLE.  AT THE VERY WORST, THEY ARE PUTTING PEOPLE AT RISK.  I WONDER HOW MANY ACCIDENTS INVOLVING THESE VEHICLES COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE BRAKES, AND ARE PEOPLE EVEN LOOKING AT THE BRAKES AS A CAUSE?  AT BEST, GM IS SHAFTING THEIR CUSTOMERS. PEOPLE ARE PAYING NEEDLESSLY FOR SERVICE WORK THEY DON'T NEED.    THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR SERIOUS INJURY RESULTING FROM THIS.  IT ALSO SPEAKS TO GM'S INTEGRITY AND ETHICS, ALLOWING AN INFERIOR BRAKE SYSTEM TO BE USED ON ITS VEHICLES.   *NLM",
