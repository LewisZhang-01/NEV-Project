WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND LEARNED THE TRANSMISSION PIN HAD BROKEN.    WE WERE INFORMED THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM, MORE THAN 30 REMANUFACTURED TRANSMISSIONS ARE ON BACK ORDER.    THE COST OF THE REPARIS IS SIGNIFICANT AND WE CANNOT BE GUARANTEED WHEN THE PARTS WIL BECOME AVAILABLE.    I CALLED CHRYSLER/PLYMOUTH TO DETERMINE IF THERE WAS A RECALL AND THERE IS NOT. IN THEIR OPINION, IT IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE.    HOW DO WE, AS CONSUMERS, MAKE THIS ISSUE KNOWN TO ENSURE A RECALL NOTICE IS ISSUED AND THE PROPER REPAIRS ARE MADE? GOD FORBID THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED ON A BUSY HIGHWAY!",
