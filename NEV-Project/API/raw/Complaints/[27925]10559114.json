        "summary": "DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE THE CAR SUDDENLY STARTED LOSING SPEED AND IT WOULD NOT LET ME ACCELERATE. I WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT TO THE SHOULDER. ONCE I GOT TO THE SHOULDER THE CAR IDLED FOR A FEW SECONDS BEFORE THE ENGINE COMPLETELY SHUT OFF. I WAS ABLE TO START THE CAR AGAIN AND DRIVE ABOUT ANOTHER MILE AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED. WE WERE ABOUT 1 MILE FROM A GM CAR DEALERSHIP AND WE MANAGED TO GET THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP, BUT IT STALLED 3 TIMES ON THE WAY (ONCE ON A 2 LANE BRIDGE). THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY COULDN'T WORK ON CADILLACS, SO WE HAD IT TOWED TO A CADILLAC DEALERSHIP (THE CAR DIED AGAIN WHILE THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER WAS TRYING TO LOAD IT). THEY HAVE DRIVEN IT OVER 200 MILES AND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. THEY DID A COMPUTER UPDATE AND ARE RETURNING THE CAR TO ME AND SAID THAT THEY ARE NOT CONFIDENT THE UPDATE WILL FIX THE PROBLEM. IT DID NOT THROW ANY WARNING LIGHTS AND THE DEALER SAID THEY DIDN'T SEE ANY CODES. WE WERE DOING 70 DOWN THE INTERSTATE AND IF THERE HADN'T BEEN A PLACE TO PULL OVER, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN REAR ENDED BY AN 18 WHEELER. THIS IS  NOT A MANUAL TRANSMISSION (I'VE SEEN REPORTS OF MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS STALLING). THIS IS AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION.  *TR",
