        "summary": "WE HAD TO HAVE A NEW TRANSMISSION PUT INTO THE VEHICLE TOWARDS THE END OF OUR WARRANTY PERIOD.  AFTER THE NEW TRANSMISSION WAS PUT IN, WE STARTED HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS AGAIN.  THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IS THAT THE CAR IS SHUTTERING DURING ACCELERATION.  YOU CAN WATCH THE TACHOMETER AND SEE IT BOUNCE UP AND DOWN DURING THE SHUTTERING.  WE FILED UNDER LEMON LAW TO HAVE THE CAR BOUGHT BACK FROM US.  DURING THE ARBITRATION, THE CAR WOULD NOT SHUTTER.  THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM.   MANY TIMES WHILE THE CAR WAS IN TO GET SERVICED ON THIS COMPLAINT, THE TECHNICIANS WERE NOT ABLE TO DUPLICATE THE SHUTTERING.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE ARBITRATOR DID NOT SETTLE IN OUR FAVOR SINCE WE WERE NOT ABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  NOW, TWO YEARS LATER, THE PROBLEM IS BECOMING SEVERE AGAIN.  IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO?  THIS IS THE SECOND TIME SINCE WE PURCHASED THE CAR BRAND NEW THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAS GONE BAD ON US.  I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER COMPLAINT FILED WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  DURING THE TIME THAT THEY REPLACED OUR TRANSMISSION, THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD US THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER VEHICLES BEING SERVICED FOR THE SAME THING IN THIS REGION.  I FEEL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE CAR BOUGHT BACK FROM US UNDER THE LEMON LAW.  UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE NOW FACED WITH THE SAME PROBLEM AGAIN, EXCEPT IT'S NOT UNDER WARRANTY.    TS",
