I BOUGHT THIS CAR USED ABOUT 3 YRS AGO CONTACTED DODGE AND THEY TOLD ME THAT MINE IS NOT A PART OF THE 2 RECALLS THAT THEY HAVE WITH THE EXACT SAME ISSUE SO IT WAS NOT A SAFETY CONCERN TO THEM. WE HAD THE ORIGINAL  TANK REPLACED WITHIN A FEW MTHS AND HAD TO TAKE IT BACK IMMEDIATELY  FOR THE EXACT SAME ISSUE. AFTER THAT IT WORKED WELL FOR THE PAST 2.5 YRS AND NOW I'M HAVING THE EXACT SAME ISSUE WITH THE TANK AGAIN. I BOUGHT  THIS NEEDED A BIG VEHICLE FOR MY FAMILY. I DON'T THINK THAT I SHOULD BE HAVING TO REPLACE TANK ASSEMBLIES  EVERY FEW YRS FOR  AN ISSUE THAT THE COMPANY  KNOWS ABOUT.   *TR",
