WHEN APART, THE CAPTAINS CHAIR BEHIND THE DRIVER'S SEAT DOES NOT AN ARMREST BUT THE OTHER CAPTAIN CHAIR DOES.  I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A VAN THAT DID NOT HAVE AN ARMREST ON BOTH OUTSIDE SEATS.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN  IF YOU ARE IN A SPIN OUT AND NEED SOMETHING TO GRAB ONTO, THERE IS NOTHING THERE IN THAT SEAT.  IT IS AN AUTOMATIC REACTION TO GRAB WHERE THE ARMREST SHOULD BE.  ALSO, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT PLACING A CHILD SAFETY SEAT IN THAT CHAIR. IF THERE IS EVER A SIDE-IMPACT, I FEEL THAT THE ARM REST MIGHT JUST BE ENOUGH TO KEEP THE SEAT FROM SLIDING OFF DUE TO THE FORCE OF THE CRASH.   *NLM",
