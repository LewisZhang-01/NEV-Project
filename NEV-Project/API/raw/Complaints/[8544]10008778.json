I CALLED TWO MOTORCYCLE REPAIR SHOPS, AND BOTH PEOPLE I SPOKE WITH KNEW WHERE THE HOLE WAS, AND WHAT MODEL I HAVE JUST BY TELLING THEM THERE WAS A HOLE. THEY EACH TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE SEEN IT MANY TIMES ON MY MODEL AND THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THERE HASN'T BEEN A RECALL. ONE OF THE MECHANICS SAID I WAS LUCKY NOT TO BE RIDING AT THE TIME BECAUSE THE GAS WOULD HAVE IGNITED WHEN IT HIT THE ENGINE. I WAS TOLD THAT THIS TANK PROBLEM SEEMED TO BE A REGULAR PROBLEM WITH SUZUKI INTRUDERS AND HONDA REBELS, AND DOES NOT USUALLY HAPPEN TO OTHER BIKES.
