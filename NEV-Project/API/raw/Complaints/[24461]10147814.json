DECEMBER 2005 RIGHT WINDOW FELL DOWN WHILE DRIVING BECAUSE REGULATOR FAILURE. CAR HAS AIR CONDITIONING AND WINDOWS ARE NOT USED MUCH. REAR WINDOW SWITCHES ARE LOCKED OUT FROM DRIVERS CONTROL BECAUSE OF A CHILD IN BACK SEAT. REASON FOR NOT BEING USED MUCH. I ONLY HAVE FIXED THE DRIVERS WINDOW BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE AND NEED TO PAY TOLLS. I HAVE CONTACTED GM ABOUT COVERING THE PARTS AND I WILL PERFORM THE INSTALL. THEY REFUSED BECAUSE OF THE 100K MILES. THIS CAR IS A 2000 PONTIAC BONNEVILLE. *JB",
