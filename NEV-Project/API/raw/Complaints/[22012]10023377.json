        "summary": "THIS COMPLAINT IS FOR THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM FOR MY VEHICLE.  MY VEHICLE IS EQUIPPED WITH POWER DOOR LOCKS AND 4 OF THE 5 DOOR LOCKS FAILED TO OPERATE AUTOMATICALLY OVER A 3 WEEK TIME SPAN.  THE PART THAT FAILED IS CALLED AN ACTUATOR, WHICH MOVES THE DOOR LOCKS UP AND DOWN.  MY TOTAL BILL WAS $900 AND EACH PART COSTS $100.  THE LOCAL PARTS DEALERS AND AUTO DEALERS HAVE SAID THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW IN THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT AND THE NEW ACTUATORS ARE BEING SOLD AS FAST AS THEY ARRIVE.  I HAVE SPOKEN WITH GM RECENTLY AND SO FAR NO SERVICE BULLETINS HAVE BEEN FILED.  I BELIEVE THERE IS AN INHERENT SAFETY RISK WITH THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ONE POSTED.  PLEASE RESEARCH THIS AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.   *NLM",
