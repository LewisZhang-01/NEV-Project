        "summary": "I HAD TURNED INTO A SHOPPING CENTER NEAR MY HOME AND THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE TIRE BLEW OUT CAUSING ME TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE CAR AND HIT THE CURB. I WAS GOING ONLY ABOUT 10 TO 15 MPH AS YOU CAN'T GO TOO FAST INTO A TURN WITH A MANUAL CAR WITHOUT STALLING. I DIDN'T HIT ANYTHING AND CHECK THE AREA WHERE THE BLOWOUT OCCURRED AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE ROAD. THE TIRE BLOWOUT ALSO CAUSED OTHER DAMAGE TO MY CAR. I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP SINCE IS WAS A BRAND NEW CAR THAT I JUST PURCHASE APPROXIMATELY 3 MONTHS AGO AND THE CAR HAS LESS THAN 3500 MILES. I EXPLAINED TO THEM WHAT HAPPENED AND ASKED IF THEY COULD LOOK INTO THEIR BEING AN ISSUE WITH THE TIRE AND THEY REFUSED TO LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF A TIRE DEFECT. THEY TRIED TO BLAME ME FOR THE TIRE BLOW OUT CLAIMING THAT I HIT SOMETHING TO CAUSE THE BLOWOUT. NOW, I AM FINDING OUT THAT OTHER CARS MY MAKE, MODEL AND YEAR WERE RECALLED DUE TO A FAULTY TIRE. I AM FRUSTRATED AND NOT SURE HOW TO GET SOMEONE TO LOOK INTO THE TIRE ISSUE. I NOW HAVE AN UNEXPECTED EXPENSE FOR REPAIRS ON A NEW CAR. I DO NOT FEEL THAT I SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE OF  THE REPAIRS OR THE IMPACT TO MY INSURANCE BECAUSE THIS ISSUE IS BEING CONSIDERED AN \"AT FAULT\" ACCIDENT.  *TR",
