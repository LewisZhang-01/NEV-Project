        "summary": "I OWN A 2002 ACURA CL TYPE S.  SINCE PURCHASING THE CAR I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT TROUBLE WITH THE TRANSMISSION.  AFTER ONLY 12,000 MILES, MY TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED.  AFTER THE REPLACEMENT, THE TRANSMISSION STILL HAD PROBLEMS AND WAS SLIPPING BUT MY DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT THERE WERE NO ISSUES WITH IT WHEN I KNEW THAT THERE DEFINITELY WAS.  AFTER GOING THE WINTER WITH A SLIPPING TRANSMISSION, IT'S NOW SUMMER AND IT IS GETTING WORST EVERY DAY.  I TOOK THE CAR TO MY DEALERSHIP TODAY AND ONCE AGAIN I'M FACED WITH FIRST A TRANSMISSION FLUSH THEN ANOTHER REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION.  I FEEL ACURA, NOT THE DEALERSHIP, HAS SHOWN THAT A GREAT REPUTATION CAN BE DISSOLVED QUICKLY BY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, SLOW REACTION TO PROBLEMS, AND NOT FIXING A CLEAR PROBLEM.  ACURA HAS EXTENDED THE WARRANTIES TO 100K ON THEIR TRANSMISSIONS BUT THIS DOES ME NO GOOD.  THIS IS A BUSINESS CAR AND I DO NOT HAVE TIME FOR THE HEADACHE OF TAKING MY CAR IN CONSTANTLY FOR SERVICE.  I BOUGHT MY ACURA BECAUSE OF THEIR REPUTATION AND BECAUSE OF OWNING A GREAT HONDA AUTOMOBILE IN THE PAST.  I WILL NOW NEVER BUY ANOTHER HONDA/ACURA PRODUCT AND THEY HAVE LOST A GOOD CUSTOMER.    *NLM",
