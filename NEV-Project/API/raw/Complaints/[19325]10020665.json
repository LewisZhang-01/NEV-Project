        "summary": "SON WAS DRIVING 99 GMC SIERRA TRUCK ON I-20 IN ARLINGTON, TX MONDAY, MAY 26TH WHEN HE BRAKED TO SLOW AND THE FRONT DRIVER SEAT SUDDENLY LURCHED FORWARD THROWING HIM INTO THE STEERING WHEEL CAUSING HIM TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE TRUCK. HE REGAINED CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE BUT WAS ALMOST REAR ENDED BY VEHICLE. SON AND FIANCEE WERE UNHURT AND NO DAMAGE WAS DONE. WHEN THEY WERE ABLE TO PULL OVER AND INVESTIGATE, THE FRONT DRIVER SEAT WOULD NOT LOCK IN PLACE. IT WOULD MOVE FORWARD AND BACKWARD WITHOUT LOCKING INTO PLACE. SON HAD TO BRACE HIS FOOT AGAINST THE DASH TO HOLD SEAT IN PLACE IN ABLE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE HOME.     SERIOUS INJURY COULD HAVE BEEN THE RESULT IF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN LOST.   FEEL THIS IS A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT AND SERIOUS INJURY COULD RESULT IF THIS HAPPENED TO OTHERS OR MYSELF SINCE I DRIVE THE SAME IDENTICAL VEHICLE.",
