        "summary": "SUDDEN UNINTENDED ACCELERATION TESLA. I DROVE MY TESLA FROM WORK, DRIVING OVER 35MILES DURING RUSH HOUR OF THE BAY AREA. WHEN I ENTERED MY SUBDIVISION, I WAS DRIVING AT 10 MPH, PULLED INTO MY DRIVEWAY MADE 90 DEGREES TURN AT 5 MPH, APPLIED THE BRAKES. INSTEAD OF STOPPING, CAR SPED UP AT EXTREMELY HIGH ACCELERATION. IT DROVE THROUGH THE GARAGE DOOR, HIT MASERATI PARKED IN THE GARAGE, AND A MOTORCYCLE PARKED NEXT TO IT. THE MASERATI TRUNK WAS PUSHED IN APPROX 3 FEET, IT SLID SIDEWAYS, HIT THE PILLAR, SMASHING DRIVER DOOR AND WINDOW, SLID TO THE FRONT AND HIT THE MOTORBIKE PARKED NEXT TO IT. IT COMPLETELY SMASHED THE REAR TRUCK, FRONT AND SIDE OF THE MASERATI. IT SMASHED THE FRONT END OF THE MOTORCYCLE. THERE WERE FLUIDS FRONT TESLA, MASERATI, AND BIKE ALL OVER THE GARAGE. THE BATTERY IN MASERATI EXPLODED LEAKING ACID ALL OVER THE GARAGE. WE THOUGHT THE FUEL TANK IN MASERATI BROKE. WE HAD TO CALL 911, DOZENS OF PERSONNEL SHOWED UP INCLUDING SEVERAL FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS, AMBULANCE, HAZMAT AMONG OTHERS. THEY SPEND OVER THREE HOURS CONTROLLING THE SITUATION.  THEY HAD TO CUT THE GARAGE DOOR TO PULL OUT THE MASERATI AND TESLA. IT WAS TOWED TO A STORAGE FACILITY NEARBY. MASERATI WAS DECLARED A TOTAL LOSS. I WAS COMPLETELY SHAKEN AND HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP AT ALL FOR LAST THREE DAYS. WHAT IF MY KIDS HAD BEEN PLAYING IN THE DRIVEWAY OR IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH I FOUND THIS IS NOT A RANDOM INSTANCE. THERE ARE DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF SIMILAR INCIDENTS WHEREIN, WHEN A DRIVER MAKES A SHARP TURN INTO A DRIVEWAY OR GARAGE AND APPLIES THE BRAKE, RATHER THAN SLOWING DOWN CAR JUST DECIDES TO SPEED UP LIKE A BULLET AND GOES THROUGH THE WALLS OR WHATEVER COMES ITS WAY. I HAVE STOPPED DRIVING FOR FORESEEABLE FUTURE, I AM NOT GOING TO PUT MY STEP IN ANOTHER TESLA FOR MY SAFETY AND SAFETY OF OTHERS. STAY AWAY FROM THIS UNPROVEN TECHNOLOGY FOR YOUR/OTHERS",
