ON THE PREVIOUS TWO FAILURES, VW WOULD NOT REPLACE ALL FOUR COILS, BUT ONLY THOSE COILS THAT WERE THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.  AS A RESULT WORK TIME HAS BEEN LOST, AND IT HAS BEEN A GREAT INCONVENIENCE TO TAKE TIME OFF OF WORK, HAVE THE CAR TOWED, AND TRAVEL TO THE REPAIR FACILITY.  REQUEST VW BE REQUIRED TO INITIATE A RECALL TO FIX ALL PROBLEMS.  *NLM",
