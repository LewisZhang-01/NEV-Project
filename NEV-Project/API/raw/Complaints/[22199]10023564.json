TEMPERATURE GAUGE INDICATED NOT OVERHEATING, WATER WAS IN RADIATOR, OIL WAS AT THE FULL MARK ON THE OIL DIP STICK. NO FLUIDS LEAKED FROM THE ENGINE.  MY VEHICLE IS AT THE FORD DEALERSHIP IN OWATANNA, MN.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY A FORD DEALERSHIP TECHNICIAN THAT HE BELIEVES IT TO BE PIECES OF THE GASKET AROUND THE OIL PUMP THAT BLOCKED THE FLOW OF OIL TO THE ENGINE SEIZING THE VALVES IN THE ENGINE.  APPARENTLY IT HAPPENS FREQUENTLY TO HIS KNOWLEDGE.  ALSO , I KNOW OF ANOTHER FORD RANGER THAT EXPERIENCED UNEXPLAINED ENGINE FAILURE THIS PAST WEEK.  I HAVE MAINTAINED OIL CHANGES WITHIN THE MANUFACTURER'S RECOMMENDATION DURING THE TIME I HAVE OWNED THE RANGER.  THE VEHICLE HAS ONLY 69136 MILES ON THE ODOMETER.  AT THIS JUNCTURE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY SERVICE AND THE DEALERSHIP HAVE NOT RESOLVED METHOD OF REPLACING THE ENGINE.   *NLM",
