I HAD VEHICLE TOWED IN FOR REPAIR TO LOCAL DEALER, THEY REPLACED A SWITCH IN THE ABS SYSTEM THAT WAS CAUSING THE BRAKES TO STICK. AS OF TODAY THE CAR IS BACK AT THE DEALER WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. IN AUGUST OF 2002 THE SWITCH IN THE BRAKE PEDAL THAT ALLOWS YOU TO PUT THE CAR INTO GEAR HAD WENT OUT. THE DEALER REPLACED THE SWITCH AND WHEN I PICKED UP MY CAR THE BRAKES WERE GRABING AS I LEFT THE DEALER, I IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT IT BACK AND TOLD THEM IT WAS NOT RIGHT. A MECHANIC AND I ROAD TESTED THE CAR AND HE STOPPED AND PHYSICALLY PULLED UP ON THE BRAKE PEDAL TO MAKE THE BRAKES RELEASE. HE STATED THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG. THAT EVENING THE CAR DID THE SAME THING WHILE I WAS ON THE INTERSTAE AND CAUSED SUCH A DRAG ON THE WHEELS THAT YOU COULD NOT GO OVER 40MPH. I WAS ABLE TO PULL OFF AT AN EXIT AND PULLED ON THE BRAKE PEDAL TO MAKE IT RELEASE. THE NEXT DAY ON MY WAY TO WORK I HAD THE CAR IN CRUISE CONTROL AND WHEN I TAPPED THE BRAKE FOR CRUISE TO RELEASE, THE BRAKES LOCKED ON THE CAR AGAIN AND I HAD TO PULL UP ON THE BRAKE WITH MY FOOT TO TRY TO GET THEM TO TURN LOOSE. THE CRUISE DID NOT RELEASE, IT GOT STUCK, I HAD TO TURN IT OFF WITH THE SWITCH ON THE STEERING MECHANISIM. I TOLD THE DEALER THAT I WOULD NOT DRIVE THE VEHICLE BECAUSE I FELT THIS PROBLEM WAS DANGEROUS AND THEY HAD IT TOWED FOR SERVICE. THEY STATED THE SWITCH THEY HAD JUST REPLACED THE DAY BEFORE WAS FAULTY. I ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE BEARINGS AND ROTARS FOR POSSIBLE DAMAGE DUE TO THE BRAKES STICKING WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY. I FEEL ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS ARE RELATED TO EACH OTHER AND ONE MAY HAVE BEEN PRECLUDED THE OTHERS. AS I STATED PREVIOUSLY THE CAR IS BACK AT THE DEALER FOR THE SAME PROBLEM AND I JUST HAPPEN TO BE 2,000 MILES OUT OF WARRANTY. THE CAR HAS HAD A WARRANTY RECALL FOR A PART IN THE ABS SYSTEM WHICH WAS DONE AT THE DEALER. THIS HAS ALL HAPPENED AFTER THE RECALL.",
