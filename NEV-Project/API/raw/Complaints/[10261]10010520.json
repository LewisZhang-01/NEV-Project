        "summary": "2001 PONTIAC GRAND PRIX HAS LOST ALL LIGHTS -- INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR -- AT NIGHT ON HIGHWAYS.  THIS BEGAN IN FEBRUARY/MARCH 2002 AND HAS CONTINUED RANDOMLY SINCE FOR A TOTAL OF SEVEN DIFFERENT OCCURRENCES TO-DATE.  IT HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP ON FOUR OCCASIONS, WITH EQUIPMENT REPLACEMENT ON THREE OCCASIONS BUT NO RESOLUTION.  NOW WE ARE BEING TOLD THAT UNLESS THE PROBLEM IS DUPLICATED WHILE IN THE SHOP, PONTIAC CAN DO NOTHING.  CONSIDERING THE FACT IT ONLY HAPPENS AFTER THE SHOPS ARE CLOSED, GETTING THE VEHICLE THERE WHILE AN OCCURRENCE IS HAPPENING IS VERY  UNLIKELY.   *NLM  THE CONSUMER STATED WHILE STOPPED AT A LIGHT, ALL INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR LIGHTS WOULD GO OUT FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN FLASH IN A SEQUENCE OF FOUR TIMES, THEY WOULD GO OUT FOR A FEW SECONDS AND COME BACK ON FOR A FEW SECONDS, THE SCENARIO CONTINUED THROUGH THE EVENING.  THERE WAS ALSO A CLICKING SOUND COMING FROM THE DASH AREA, AS IF THERE WAS A SWITCH TRYING TO CONNECT. THE CONSUMER STATED SHE EXPERIENCED THE LIGHTS GOING OUT AND COMING BACK ON FOR A PERIOD OF 10 YEARS. THE REPAIR SHOP STATED A HEADLAMP LIGHTING CIRCUIT BREAKER LOCATED IN THE DASH ON THE RIGHT SIDE NEEDED REPLACED.  THE CONSUMER STATED THE PROBLEM HAS SINCE RESURFACED. UPDATED 04/01/13",
