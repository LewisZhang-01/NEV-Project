        "summary": "THE 1992 MERCURY COUGAR INVOLVED IN THE ACCIDENT BELONGED TO MY FATHER, BUT HAD BEEN LOANED TO ME. MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING IT AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. HE PASSED OUT, POSSIBLY FROM LOW BLOOD SUGAR AND RAN THE CAR OFF THE ROAD. IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT HE WAS GOING 50MPH, WHEN HE HIT A DIRT CULVERT THAT WAS ABOUT 5 FT HIGH. THE IMPACT CRUNCHED THE FRONT OF THE CAR AGAINST THE FIREWALL LIKE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO. THE  PROBLEM IS THAT THE METAL CROSS BARS IN THE TRUNK, BEHIND THE BACK SEAT SNAPPED, WHICH CAUSED EVERYTHING IN THE TRUNK TO FLY INTO THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT. LUCKILY NOBODY WAS KILLED IN THE ACCIDENT FROM THE FLYING DEBREE. THE FORCE OF THE CROSS BARS SNAPPING, KNOCKED THE BACKSEAT COMPLETELY OUT OF PLACE. IF A CHILD HAD BEEN IN THE CAR, THEY WOULD NOT HAVE STOOD A CHANCE OF SURVIVAL BECAUSE OF ALL THE ITEMS IN THE TRUNK SLAMMING INTO THE PASSENGER AREA.*AK",
