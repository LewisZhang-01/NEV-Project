WHEN I HAD THE OIL CHANGED THIS PAST WEEKEND, THE MECHANIC POINTED OUT TO ME THAT ONE OF THE TIRES WAS DEFECTIVE.  IT HAD, HE SAID A BROKEN INTERIOR BELT THAT HAD WEAKENED THE TIRE TO THE POINT THAT IT COULD HAVE BLOWN AT ANY TIME.  [THE TIRE HAD NO TREAD LEFT IN SPOTS AND ALSO HAD A BULGE.] I HAD THE TIRE REPLACED AND AM ALSO COMPLAINING TO FIRESTONE.  BUT I WANTED TO REGISTER WITH YOU THE FACT THAT AT LEAST ONE TYPE OF THIS TYPE HAD A DEFECT THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  THANK YOU.",
