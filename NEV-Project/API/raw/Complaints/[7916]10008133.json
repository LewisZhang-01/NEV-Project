IT WAS EXPLAINED FROM THE DEALER THAT THE RUST BUILD-UP ON THE ROTORS MAY BE CAUSING THE BRAKE TO LOCKUP CAUSING THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES TO FUNCTION.  THIS IS A VERY SCARY SITUATION WHEN PULLING UP TO A STOP WITH A CAR IN FRONT OF YOU AND THE CAR WILL LURCH FORWARD WITH YOUR FOOT PUSHING DOWN ON THE BRAKE PEDAL.*JB",
