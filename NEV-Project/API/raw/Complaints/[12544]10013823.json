SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY ($1,479 -60K CHECKUP FOR  BREAKS, THROTTLE, FUEL SENDER REPLACEMENT, ETC) ONLY TO HAVE TO BRING IT BACK A FEW WEEKS LATER BECAUSE IT STILL STALLED OUT.  THEY \"DISCOVERED\" THE FUEL SENSOR WIRE WAS CORRODED, HAD TO WAIT 2 WEEKS FOR PART TO COME IN (THEY DID PAY FOR A RENTAL). ONLY TO HAVE PROBLEM START UP AGAIN A FEW DAYS LATER.  THIS WAS THE 5TH TIME IN 8 MONTHS I HAD IT IN FOR THE SAME ISSUE.  I DID TELL THEM THAT IT DIDN'T OCCUR AS MUCH WHEN I PUT IN DRY GAS, THEY TOLD ME TO CONTINUE TO DO AND  THAT THEY COULDN'T HELP ME SINCE THEY WEREN'T AROUND WHEN IT OCCURRED.
