        "summary": "1998 DODGE INTREPID--RACK AND PINION FAILED/BROKE. I HAD PULLED UP TO THE CURB TO RETRIEVE THE MAIL AND AS I TURNED THE STEERING WHEEL TO THE RIGHT TO PULL AWAY, I FELT/HEARD A LOUD POP. THE STEERING WHEEL WAS NO LONGER CONNECTED TO THE RACK AND PINION AS THE R&P HAS FAILED/BROKEN. THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD FREELY TURN BUT THE WHEELS WERE NOT MOVING. I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALER WHO REPLACED THE RACK AND PINION STEERING AT A COST OF $650.00. FORTUNATELY, THE DEALER SPLIT THE COST WITH ME AS I HAD JUST BOUGHT THE CAR (USED) 30 DAYS PRIOR. I WAS STILL OUT $350.00. MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS, WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO MY FAMILY, SPECIFICALLY MY WIFE AND MY 2 YEAR OLD SON HAD THAT PART FAILED WHILE I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY OR IN HEAVY CITY TRAFFIC. IT COULD HAVE COST US OUR LIVES...I ALSO HAVE A SLIGHT SHIMMY IN THE STEERING WHEEL WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED. I'M GUESSING A WARPED ROTOR AS I RECALL READING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BEING AN INTREPID PROBLEM ALSO....I WARN ANY OF YOU WHO ARE HAVING STEERING PROBLEMS TO GET IT FIXED BEFORE YOU DRIVE IT....THE RACK AND PINION STEERING SYSTEM THAT WONT BE RECALLED COULD HAVE COST US OUR LIVES.",
