THIS AT 72,000 MILES, AND AFTER REPLACING ENTIRE ENGINE (UNDER EXTENDED WARRANTY) AT 59,000 MILES. THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN SERVICED PER THE OWNER'S MANUAL, SINCE BUYING NEW. THE ONLY SATISFACTION IS THAT FORD HAS LOST MONEY ON THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE OF ALL THE WARRANTY WORK DONE FOR THE FIRST SIX YEARS OF IT'S LIFE. HAVE HAD MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THE LAST 4 FORDS I HAVE OWNED, ALL AT LESS THAN 60,000 MILES. NO MORE FORDS IN MY FUTURE.    *JB",
