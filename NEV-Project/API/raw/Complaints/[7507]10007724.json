YET, CADILLAC REFUSES TO INITIATE A RECALL...THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE, BECAUSE OF THE RISK FOR ACCIDENT AND FATALITIES....WHEN THE ENGINE STALLS IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO QUICKLY STEER OR SAFELY STOP THE VEHICLE.    I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST FOR THE NHTSA TO REQUIRE CADILLAC TO RECALL EVERY VEHICLE WITH THIS PROBLEM.    I ALSO FEEL CADILLAC SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO DESIGN A BACKUP SYSTEM FOR FUTURE ENGINES THAT WOULD KEEP THE ENGINE RUINNING IF THE \"CRANK SENSOR\" WOULD FAIL.    LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR RESPONSE.",
