        "summary": "THIS IS SECOND INCIDENT OF SAME FAILURE; OF CAR STOPPING RUNNING WHILE DRIVING ON FREEWAY. ( ODI#10606705) THE LOCATION AND EASE OF TURNING THE CAR OFF WHILE IN MOTION IS VERY UNSAFE. I WAS GOING APPROXIMATELY 73 MPH WHEN I REACHED UP TO REDIRECT THE LEFT CENTER AIR VENT AWAY FROM ME. IN TURNING THE WHEEL FOR CONTROL OF AIR SPEED UNDOUBTEDLY MY KNUCKLE GRAZED THE ON/OFF STARTER BUTTON AND THE CAR ODOMETER TOOK AN IMMEDIATE DROP TO ZERO. AS I STATED BEFORE YOU CANNOT PUT THE CAR IN PARK OR NEUTRAL, STEP ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AND RESTART THE CAR AT INTERSTATE SPEED. I REENACTED THIS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AT SLOW SPEED AND THE SAME THING HAPPENS. THE ON/OFF BUTTON SHOULD NOT BE IN  A GROUP WITH ALL THE OTHER BUTTONS, IT SHOULD BE PLACED OFF TO THE SIDE AND SEPARATED FROM THEM BY A  SECTION OF DASHBOARD MATERIAL. THIS IS A VERY SHOCKING EXPERIENCE AND ONE THAT IS TOTALLY UNEXPECTED! I CAN SEE WHAT COULD OCCUR IF A PERSON WERE IN HEAVY TRAFFIC AND COULD NOT GET OUT OF THE WAY OF SEMI'S ETC. PLEASE LET BUICK KNOW ABOUT THIS DEFECT !!!!!  *TR",
