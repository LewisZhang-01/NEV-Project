        "summary": "I BOUGHT A USED 2005 SATURN RELAY 3 IN JANUARY 2010.  I HAVE 2 MAJOR ISSUES GOING ON: POWER SLIDING DOORS WILL NOT RECOGNIZE THAT THEY ARE CLOSED AND WILL CONTINUE TO DING AS IF I WAS DRIVING WITH THEM OPEN...ON A FEW OCCASIONS I HAVE HEARD THE POWER DOOR MOTOR START ON ITS OWN AS IF IT WAS TRYING TO OPEN THE DOORS WHILE I AM DRIVING!  SECOND ISSUE IS ABS/TRACTION CONTROL LIGHTS HAVE BEEN COMING ON SPORADICALLY SINCE I PURCHASED IT.  OF COURSE, NO ONE CAN FIND THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY CAN'T REPLICATE IT.  IT DOESN'T MATTER THE DRIVING CONDITIONS, DRIVING TIME, WEATHER OR ANYTHING ELSE.  BOTH HAVE HAPPENED AT VARIOUS SPEEDS.  CURRENTLY THE LIGHTS ARE STAYING ON MORE THAN OFF AND YESTERDAY WHILE DRIVING, THE WARNING LIGHTS WERE OFF UNTIL I STEPPED ON THE BRAKES, FELT AND HEARD A CLUNKING SOUND, THE BRAKE PETAL GAVE WAY SOME, AND THE SERVICE ABS/NO TRACTION CONTROL LIGHTS CAME BACK ON AGAIN.  THE CAR DID STOP.  TALKED TO THE USED CAR DEALERSHIP THAT SOLD IT TO ME AND I AM CURRENTLY MAKING ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE VEHICLE LOOKED AT.  IN RESEARCHING I HAVE FOUND NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THESE SAME ISSUES ON A NUMBER OF FORUMS. *TR",
