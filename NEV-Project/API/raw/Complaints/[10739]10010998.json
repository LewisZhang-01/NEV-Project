I HAD TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED AND 3 WEEKS LATER REC'D IT BACK ALONG W/ A BILL FOR $300.  THE FUEL PUMP WAS ON BACKORDER FOR 3 WEEKS AND I ALSO KNOW SOMEONE ELSE WHO OWNS AN XTERRA AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO HER JUST LAST WEEK.  TODAY, AFTER HAVING THE CAR BACK FOR LESS THAN A WEEK IT DIED AGAIN!!!  I THINK NISSAN NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS.  I HAVE SENT THEM, THE DEALERSHIP THAT FIXED IT AND THE DEALERSHIP THAT I BOUGHT IT FROM ALL E-MAILS OF WHICH HAVE BEEN IGNORED!!  I WILL SERIOUSLY CONSIDER NOT BUYING A NISSAN NEXT TIME I AM IN THE MARKET, WHICH MAY BE VERY SOON@@@",
