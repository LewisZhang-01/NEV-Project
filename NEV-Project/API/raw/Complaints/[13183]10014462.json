TO HAVE 40000 MILES ON A CAR AND HAVE VIRTUALLY NO WEAR ON THE FRONT DISC PADS GIVES ME CAUSE FOR CONCERN.  WHAT IS THE BRAKE DESIGN BASIS FOR THE 2000 JETTA?  IS THE OPERATION OF ONLY THE REAR BRAKES A SAFETY CONCERN?  CAN THE 2000 JETTA MEET THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION (NHTSA) STANDARDS FOR ALLOWABLE STOPPING DISTANCE WITH ONLY REAR DISC BRAKE OPERATION?  VW INTERNATIONAL RESPONDED BY PHONE CALL NOTING THAT THEY WERE NOT CONCERNED IF THE FRONT WHEEL BRAKES WERE NOT WORKING.  OUR FAMILY PURCHASED TWO 2000 JETTA'S AT THE SAME TIME.  THE SECOND JETTA  HAD THE REAR BRAKES REPLACED AT 30000 MILES AT DEALER COST.  THEY CALLED IT PREMATURE WEAR.  ALSO AT 40000 MILES THE SECOND JETTA FRONT BRAKES HAD TO BE REPLACED.  THE DEALER CALLED THIS NORMAL WEAR.   I'M NOT SURE WHAT IS CONSIDERED NORMAL BASED ON WHAT VW SAYS.  I DO KNOW I AM CONCERNED THAT THE FRONT BRAKES ARE NOT WORKING.   *NLM     INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
