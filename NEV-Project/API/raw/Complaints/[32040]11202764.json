I FOUND SOME WEBSITES SHOWING WHERE THESE MONITORS ARE AND HAVE FOUND THAT MINE ARE COVERED IN DIRT AND SEEM TO HAVE THE DRIED SALT \"WHITE\" CRUST ON THEM.  MY GUESS, JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE IS THAT THEY ARE CORRODED AND NEED REPLACING.  THIS SEEMS TO BE A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT NEEDS LOOKING INTO AS THIS CLEARLY IS A SAFETY CONCERN.",
