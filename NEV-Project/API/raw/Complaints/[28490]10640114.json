THE CAR WOULD STILL MOVE FORWARD (PERHAPS 5 MPH OR LESS), AND WE WERE ABLE GET THE FLASHERS ON AND TO PARK ON A SIDE ROAD.   THE SITUATION WAS VERY DIFFICULT AS WE HAD TO CROSS A LANE OF TRAFFIC AT LOW SPEED, WHERE TRAFFIC NORMALLY MOVES AT 40-50 MPH.  AFTER LOOKING IN THIS DATA BASE AND AT OTHER INTERNET SOURCES, THIS PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE RELATIVELY COMMON TO THE FORD EDGE, BUT WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A RECALL LETTER ABOUT IT.  *TR",
