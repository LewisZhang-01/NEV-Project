I KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS OF TRANSMISSION FAILURES WITH THESE ATVS BUT YAMAHA HAS DONE NOTHING.  I BELIEVE THAT THESE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS COULD RESULT IN PERSONAL INJURY IF THE TRANSMISSION LOCK UP AT HIGH SPEEDS.  MINE HOWEVER WAS AT A LOWER SPEED.  YAMAHA WON'T ADMIT THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THESE ATV'S BUT YET WHEN I GO TO ORDER THE PARTS I NEED TO FIX MY ATV ALL THE PARTS I NEED SEEM TO BE ON A BACKORDER. COULD THIS BE BECAUSE THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THIS PARTICUALR ATV TRYING TO BE FIXED?  THIS REALLY MADE ME ANGRY WITH YAMAHA MOTORS AND I WANTED TO VOICE MY OPINION AND CONCERN.   *JB",
