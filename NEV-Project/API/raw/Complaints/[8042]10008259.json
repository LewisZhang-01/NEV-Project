THE CARAVAN I OWN HAS ONLY 42,000 MILES ON IT.  I DO NOT EVEN OWN IT FOR 2 YEARS.  IT WAS A BUY BACK FROM THE DEALER.  THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 3 YEARS OF 36,000 MILES.  I WAS TOLD BY THE MECHANIC FROM THE DEALER I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM THAT THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.  NOW I AM FORCED TO PAY OVER $1100 FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION.  I WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAVE AGREED TO SPLIT THE BILL OF APPROXIMATELY $2200.  I FEEL I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING AS THIS SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED AND IS A DEFECT FROM THE  CHRYSLER MANUFACTURER.  I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE COMPLAINING.  THERE IS A WHOLE WEB SITE DEDICATED TO COMPLAINTS BY CONSUMERS WHICH I HAVE DOWN LOADED AND IS OVER 11 PAGES LONG.  *JB",
