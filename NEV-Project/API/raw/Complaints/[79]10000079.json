STILL RUNNING ON SECOND REPAIR JOB AS OF 12/12/2002.    AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION SHIFTED ROUGH (WHICH I WAS TOLD WAS \"STANDARD\" BEHAVIOR) FOR THE ENTIRE TIME I OWNED THE CAR.  THE TRANSMISSION DIED A YEAR AGO AND THE LOCAL MAZDA DEALERSHIP SAID THAT IT WOULD COST ME ABOUT $4000 TO REPLACE IT.  I WENT TO A PRIVATE TRANSMISSION SHOP INSTEAD AND CUT THAT COST IN HALF.  REPAIR JOB DIDN'T LAST VERY LONG, HOWEVER AND I WOUND UP GOING TO A DIFFERENT SHOP THE SECOND TIME.  STILL RUNNING FOR THE MOMENT.    I FULLY BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE EXPERIENCED SUCH PROBLEMS WITH MY CAR IN THE FIRST PLACE.  GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE REGARDING THE 626'S TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS, MY OPINION IS SHARED BY MANY.",
