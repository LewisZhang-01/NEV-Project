MY GARAGE. I ALSO NOTICED FUEL LEAKING UNDER THE VEHICLE AS WELL. THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT WAS RECALLED BY MERCEDES ONCE BEFORE. THEY FIXED IT BACK IN 2007 UNDER A RECALL WHEN IT WAS OWNED BY THE PREVIOUS OWNER. I HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE SINCE APRIL 2011 AND THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED AGAIN IN MY OWNERSHIP AROUND THE APPROXIMATE MONTH OF NOVEMBER 2011. I HAVE ALREADY TAKEN IT TO A SHOP AND HAVE PAID THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO HAVE THIS ISSUE ADDRESSED BUT ACCORDING TO MY MECHANIC THE FUEL SYSTEM IS FAILING IN MULTIPLE SPOTS. NOW THE VEHICLE SITS. PLEASE HELP ME GET MERCEDES TO FIX THIS VERY COSTLY AND POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING ISSUE RESOLVED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND INTEREST IN MY FAMILIES AND MY SAFETY. I SINCERELY APPRECIATE ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFER.  *TR",
