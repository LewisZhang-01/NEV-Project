THE ALTERNATOR WENT OUT. HOW CAN A 3 YEAR OLD CAR WITH 70000 MILES HAVE A BAD ALTERNATOR?? THAT'S UNHEARD OF. I HAVE A CAR WITH 140,000 MILES ON IT AND HAVE NEVER HAD TO REPLACE THE ALTERNATOR. THIS IS CLEARLY AN ISSUE! THE DODGE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAS EVEN SAID THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE AND THESE CARS ARE NOTORIOUS FOR THAT.   WAS ALSO HAVING ISSUES WITH THE HEADLIGHT GOING OUT. GOT IT FIXED AND LESS THAN A MONTH LATER IT WAS RECALLED.  *TR",
