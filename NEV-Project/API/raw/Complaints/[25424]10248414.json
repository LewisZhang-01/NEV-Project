I THINK THEY NEED TO     RECALL THIS PART AND FIX THE PROBLEM.  MITSUBISHI CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID THEY WILL NOT RECALL BECAUSE IT IS NOT A SAFETY CONCERN.  I THINK IT IS BECAUSE MOST OF THE CONTROLS BREAK OFF ON A/C AND THAT WOULD NOT BE FUN DRIVING IN A BLIZZARD WITH YOUR A/C ON IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER.  I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON FIGHTING FOR A RECALL OTHER CUSTOMERS ARE TO. *TR",
