I WANTED TO CHECK ON A SECOND OPINION JUST TO BE SAFE. WHEN DOING SO  I HAVE BEEN TO 3 DIFFERENT INDEPENDENT AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR SHOPS THAT SPECIALIZE IN HONDA'S. EACH STATES THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF REQUESTS FOR  CATALYTIC CONVERTERS OVER THE PAST 8-9 MONTHS FOR MY SAME MODEL. I FOUND THAT TO BE VERY DISTURBING. I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT THIS BE LOOKED FURTHER INTO. *JB",
