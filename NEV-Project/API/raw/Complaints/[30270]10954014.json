EVERY SINGLE TIME THIS HAPPENS, AS SOON AS I TURN OFF MY CAR (DOESN'T MATTER IF I KEEP DRIVING FOR A LONG WHILE OR STOP DRIVING SHORTLY AFTER IT HAPPENS), IT WON'T START AGAIN. IT'S COMPLETELY DEAD AND I HAVE TO HAVE IT JUMPED.  MY CAR HAS 94,000 MILES ON IT, AND IN THE PAST 8 YEARS, THE CAR HAS DIED/I'VE HAD TO HAVE IT JUMPED OVER 30 TIMES. I'M ON MY 5TH BATTERY! AFTER THE RECALL FOR THE ALTERNATOR GASKET VALVE CAP, I THOUGHT THESE PROBLEMS WOULD BE FIXED, BUT I'VE HAD EXACTLY THE SAME ELECTRICAL ISSUES/BATTERY CONSTANTLY DYING SINCE THEN! THAT RECALL LITERALLY DID NOTHING.  THIS IS VERY UNSAFE, AS THE CAR CAN JUST SUDDENLY LOSE POWER WHILE DRIVING, AND THEN IF YOU TURN THE CAR OFF, IT WON'T START UP AGAIN WITHOUT BEING JUMPED. HYUNDAI NEEDS TO FIX THIS ASAP. THERE ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS, AND IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE!!    I'LL IN THE PAST 8 YEARS, I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE MY BATTERY 5 TIMES IN MY VERACRUZ.",
