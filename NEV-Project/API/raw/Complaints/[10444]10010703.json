WHEN I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE ACCELERATOR THE VEHICLE KEPT ACCELERATING ON IT'S OWN EVEN WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL OFF AND MY FOOT OFF THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL.  I THEN TRIED TO APPLY THE BRAKES BUT SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS ACCELERATING THE EXPLORER JUST SHOOK. I ALSO DOUBLE CHECKED THE CRUISE CONTROL AND IT WAS IN FACT OFF AND TRIED TO PUMP THE GAS TO SEE IF THE PEDAL WAS STUCK BUT NEITHER WORKED.  WHEN THE VEHICLE REACHED APPROXIMATELY 85 MPH I ATTEMPTED TO SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL WHEN THE VEHICLE SKIDDED OUT OF CONTROL.  THE SKID MARK WAS ABOUT 350 FEET LONG AND THEN THE EXPLORER LEFT THE ROAD AND ROLLED A FEW TIMES UNTIL IT CAME TO A STOP ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE WITH THE ENGINE STILL ROARING.  THE ENGINE ONLY STOPPED WHEN PASSENGER TURNED OFF THE IGNITION KEY SINCE THE DRIVER WAS UNCONSCIOUS.          *JB",
