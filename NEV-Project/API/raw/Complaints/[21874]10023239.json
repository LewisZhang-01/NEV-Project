AUDI SAYS THIS IS NORMAL- WE HAVE HAD TWO EMERGENCIES ON THE FREEWAY WHERE WE ALMOST RAN OUT OF OIL. ALSO, IT IS VERY HARD TO READ THE OIL DIP STICK- IT IS ARTFUL NOT USEFUL. ROTORS (ALL) FAILED AT 14K MILES AND HAD TO BE REPLACED. WE ARE ADVISED WE ARE NOT ALONE. AUDI CORP ARROGANT AND WILL NOT RESPOND. THROWS EVERYTHING BACK TO DEALER. DEALER FIXED ROTOR PROBLEM AT NO COST. TRIED TO CHARGE  FOR OIL TEST REPAIR. BELIEVE THERE ARE DESIGN ISSUES IN BOTH INSTANCES. AUDI HAS LEARNED NOTHING FROM THEIR PAST PROBLEMS- THEY ARE THE MOST ARROGANT BUSINESS I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED.  *JB",
