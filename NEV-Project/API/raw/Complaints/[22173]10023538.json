        "summary": "WINDSHIELD WIPERS.  2000 CHEVROLET VENTURE VAN. THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS GET CAUGHT TOGETHER AND BREAK. THIS VAN USES THE CRISS CROSS PATTERN AND THE DRIVERS SIDE WIPER SLIPS OUT OF TIME AND CAUSES A COLLISION BETWEEN THE WIPER BLADES AND CAUSES THE PASSENGER SIDE WIPER TO BEND OR BREAK WHEN THE TWO WIPER BLADES MEET. REMOVING THE PASSENGER SIDE BLADE CAUSES THE DRIVERS SIDE BLADE TO OPERATE IN A CHANGING PATTERN, MOVING FROM AS LITTLE AS 5\" TO MOVING BEYOND THE DRIVERS SIDE WINDSHIELD EDGE WHERE IS GETS BOUND UP ON THE DOOR. WE HAVE HAD THE VAN FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS AND HAVE CHANGED THE WIPER BLADES ABOUT 6 OR 8 TIMES. FINALLY JUST DISCOVERED THAT THE PROBLEM IS IN THE WORKINGS OF THE WIPER MOTOR ARMS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNED WELL AND VERY CHEAP QUALITY CONNECTIONS. THEY BECOME LOOSE AND ALLOW THE BLADES TO SLIP FROM THE PROPER PATH AND COLLIDE WITH EACH OTHER. VERY DIFFICULT TO DRIVE WHEN YOU GET CAUGHT IN A RAIN STORM AT NIGHT WITH NO WIPERS TO SPEAK OFF WHEN YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE AND HAVE TO BE SOME WHERE.   *NLM",
