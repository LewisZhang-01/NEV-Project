I HAD FREON PUT BACK INTO IT, BUT AFTER A FEW DAYS, THE FREON WAS GONE.  THE MECHANIC PUT A DYE INTO THE SYSTEM TO SEE IF THERE WAS A LEAK, BUT HE COULDN'T SEE ANY PROBLEM.  MY CAR HAS ALWAYS OVERHEATED IN TRAFFIC.  OIL IS LEAKING FROM MY HEAD GASKETS.  NOW, IT IS HAVING TROUBLE STARTING PERIODICALLY.  I WAS IN CAMDEN WHEN IT WOULDN'T START. NOW I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE IT.  WHEN I START THE CAR, A CLICKING NOISE COMES FROM THE STARTER.  OH YEAH, I HAD THE STARTER \"FIXED\" A YEAR AGO BECAUSE OF THE RECALL.  THERE IS A NOISE COMING FROM MY ALTERNATOR.  I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS THE ALTERNATOR OR THE STARTER THAT'S KEEPING THE CAR FROM STARTING.  FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN IN MY CAR AND THE COMPLAINTS FROM OTHERS, THIS IS NOT A RELIABLE CAR. *JB",
