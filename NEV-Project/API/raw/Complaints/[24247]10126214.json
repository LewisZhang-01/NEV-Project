ON JUNE 21, 2005 CONSUMER DROVE TO STORE , WHEN CONSUMER WENT TO SHUT OFF VEHICLE THE IGNITION WOULD NOT MOVE. CONSUMER DROVE HOME AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO REMOVE KEY. CONSUMER DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE VEHICLE OUTSIDE OF STORE WITH ENGINE RUNNING. WHEN CONSUMER ARRIVED HOME HE PROCEEDED TO MOVE THE STEERING WHEEL BACK AND FORTH  VIOLENTLY UNTIL HE FINALLY GOT IGNITION TO SHUT OFF AND KEY TO DISLODGE. CONSUMER SPOKE TO DEALER, AND WAS TOLD THAT THIS SOMETIMES HAPPENED, BUT BECAUSE THE WARRANTY EXPIRED  IT WAS NOT DEALER'S RESPONSIBILITY. DEALER SAID THAT TWO CYLINDERS COULD SOMETIMES LOCK, CAUSING KEY TO BE STUCK. ALSO, DEALER  SAID THAT CONSUMER WOULD HAVE TO PAY $135  JUST FOR DEALER TO LOOK AT PROBLEM. IT CAN OCCUR AT ANYTIME. PROBLEM HAPPENED  FOR ABOUT A YEAR.*AK",
