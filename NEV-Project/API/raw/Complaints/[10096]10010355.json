I PUT THE FIRE OUR WITH SNOW FROM THE ROADSIDE. AS WE CONTINUED HOME THE RADIO WENT DEAD, THE BATTERY WENT TO LOW AND THE LIGHTS STARTED FLICKING ON AND OFF. AS A RESULT OF THE FIRE THE WINDSHIELD CRACKED, AND CONTINUED ALL THE WAY ACROSS FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER. I LUCKILY FOUND AN OPEN FORD DEALER THAT GAVE US A SMALL RENTAL AND REPAIRED THE TRUCK.  *JB",
