SUBARU HAS ISSUED A TSB # 09-36-03 DATED 4/01/03 ACKNOWLEDGING THE PROBLEM AND HAS A REPAIR KIT SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THIS PROBLEM SHOULD RESULT IN A RECALL BY SUBARU AND BE REPAIRED AT SUBARU'S EXPENSE. IT IS A POTENTIAL EXPLOSIVE/FIRE EVENT AND IS A FAULT IN THE ORIGINAL DESIGN. THE DEALERS WILL NOT FIX THIS PROBLEM WITHOUT CHARGING THE CUSTOMERS. THE REPAIR KIT IS ABOUT $60 BUT LABOR IS $700-800. ITS A SAFETY ISSUE  AND I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE IT LIKE IT IS.  *JB",
