AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, THERE IS A LOUD VIBRATION COMING FROM THE RIGHT REAR OF THE VEHICLE, AND THE SHIFTING BECOMES VERY ERRATIC AND THE O/D LIGHT FLICKERS.  I HAVE TALKED TO SEVERAL DEALERS.  TWO OF THEM HAVE STATED THAT THE VIBRATION IS BECAUSE OF THE ROAD SURFACE.  WHEN TRYING TO SHIFT INTO REVERSE, THERE IS A POPPING SOUND AND HESITATION BEFORE THE VEHICLE ACTUALLY MOVES.  *LA",
