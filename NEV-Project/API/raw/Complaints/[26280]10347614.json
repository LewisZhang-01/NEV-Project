ONCE POWER IS LOST, THE DOOR HANDLES WILL NOT OPERATE TO OPEN LOCKED DOORS AND THE ELECTRICAL WINDOWS WILL NOT WORK TRAPPING PASSENGERS INSIDE.  I DISCOVERED THIS WHEN A FUSE, #52 ON A 2006 325I, BLEW AND THE DOOR WOULD NOT OPEN.  LUCKILY ONE DOOR WAS UNLOCKED IN THE BACK AND MY DAUGHTER HAD TO CLIMB INTO THE BACK SEAT TO GET OUT.  ADVISE FROM DEALERSHIP WAS TO CARRY A DEVICE IN THE CAR THE BREAK OUT THE WINDOW IN CASE OF ACCIDENT. *TR",
