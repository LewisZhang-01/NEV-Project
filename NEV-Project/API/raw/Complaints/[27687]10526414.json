SHE WENT TO MERCEDES BENZ OF BEVERLY HILLS AND THEY WANT 160.00 TO DIAGNOSE AND THEN WOULD PUT HER IN A LOANER. THE ESTIMATE WAS AROUND 1700.00 TO FIX 1 AIR STRUT. I HAVE DONE MY RESEARCH AND THIS IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE AS THE SPEED SHE WAS TRAVELING AT. IM NOT SURE WHY MB HAS NOT ISSUED A SAFETY RECALL ON THESE FAULTY PARTS. DEFINITELY WOULD BE NICE IF THEY WOULD COVER THIS.  *TR",
