I MOVED INTO THE TURN LANE AND APPLIED BRAKES TO TURN A 90 DEGREE CORNER.  THE BRAKES FAILED.  I HAD TURNED THE WHEEL ANTICIPATING A NORMAL TURN HOWEVER THE CAR KEPT MOVING STRAIGHT AHEAD.  THE CAR JUMPED A CONCRETE ISLAND AND CAME TO REST.  I KNEW IMMEDIATELY THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE DRIVER SIDE ALTHOUGH THE DAMAGE WAS UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE.  IT HAD TO BE TOWED TO AN AUTO REPAIR FACILITY APPROX ONE HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE SCENE OF THE ACCIDENT.  POLICE CAME BUT NO CITATION WAS ISSUED. DAMAGE INCLUDES A BROKEN FRONT AXLE, DAMAGE TO SUSPENSION, WHEEL ETC. I CONTACTED NISSAN TO DETERMINE IF MY VEHICLE WAS INCLUDED IN THE FAULTY BRAKE FLUID RESERVOIR CAP RECALL.  NISSAN STATES IT IS NOT.  THE BRAKES FAILED AND THERE'S NO EXPLANATION.  *TR",
