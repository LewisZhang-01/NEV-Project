        "summary": "ON 2003-2004 BMW 3 SERIES E46 SEDANS WITH OEM ZKW MANUFACTURED XENON (HID) HEADLIGHTS, THE REFLECTIVE BOWL FOR THE HEADLIGHTS WILL BECOME DISCOLORED AND NON-REFLECTIVE AFTER NORMAL USE WITH OEM BULBS. OVER TIME, THE HEAT FROM THE OEM BULB WILL SCORCH THE REFLECTIVE BOWL AND DRAMATICALLY REDUCE LIGHT OUTPUT TO UNSAFE LEVELS FOR NIGHT TIME DRIVING. BMW HAS NOT NOTIFIED OWNERS OF THE DESIGN FLAW, AND NO REPLACEMENT PARTS ARE AVAILABLE OTHER THAN THE ENTIRE EXPENSIVE, NEW HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLIES THAT WILL SUFFER FROM THE SAME PROBLEM IN TIME.  THOUGH BMW REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AN ISSUE EXISTS, BMW CHANGED THE XENON HEADLIGHT REFLECTOR DESIGN FOR LATER MODEL YEARS TO A METAL REFLECTOR ASSEMBLY THAT DOES NOT DEGRADE WHEN EXPOSED TO THE NORMAL OPERATING TEMPERATURES OF THE OEM XENON BULBS. THESE NEWER DESIGNED HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLIES TO NOT SUFFER FROM ANY REDUCTION IN LIGHT OUTPUT WITH USE.  UPDATED IVOQ 07/26/11  *TR",
