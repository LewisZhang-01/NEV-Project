WE BOUGHT THE CAR NEW AND WITHIN THE FIRST 400 MILES EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM. IT WAS IN THE SHOP FROM 3/16 TO 3/21 THEY REPLACED THE MASTER CYLINDER AND CYLINDER ASSEMBLY. THEY FINISHED IT JUST IN TIME FOR MY HUSBAND'S PLANNED VACATION. THE VACATION INCLUDED DRIVING THE KIA OVER 2000 MILES. ON THE WAY BACK, STILL OVER 700 MILES FROM HOME AND JUST PRIOR TO TRAVELLING THROUGH THE SMOKEY'S, THE BRAKES HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. I'M TYPING THIS AS I FRET ABOUT WHETHER HE WILL MAKE IT HOME SAFELY. I CALLED THE SHOP HE IS SCHEDULED TO GO BACK IN ON MONDAY. I HOPE HE MAKES IT HOME SAFELY TO GET TO THAT APPOINTMENT AND THAT THEY CAN REALLY CORRECT THE PROBLEM.",
