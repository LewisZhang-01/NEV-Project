I HAVE SPENT LOTS OF MONEY AND 2 WEEKS WITHOUT MY CAR AS A RESULT OF THE INABILITY OF REPAIR PEOPLE TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE AFTER ONE WEEK AND FINALLY FINDING OUT THE PROBLEM, IT IS TAKING ANOTHER WEEK TO GET THE PARTS IN ILLINOIS. WHILE THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CAUSED AN INJURY IN THIS CASE. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN ON THE HIGHWAY AND CAUSE A HORRENDOUS MESS. I ALSO ASKED THE DEALER IF HE COULD JUST DISCONNECT IT AND WAS TOLD NO!!!      *JB",
