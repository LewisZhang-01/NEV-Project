A SPARK PLUG WAS REPLACED. 1 MONTH LATER CK ENGINE LIGHT ON AGAIN. NEW FUEL INJECTOR. 2 DAYS LATER CK ENGINE LIGHT AGAIN. NEEDED NEW MOTOR AT 3800 MILES. 1 WEEK LATER CAUGHT ON FIRE IN OUR GARAGE.  KIA REGIONAL MANAGEMENT CHRIS BUTLER SAID THEY WOULD REPAIR DAMAGES FROM FIRE BUT HAD NO CONCERN THAT OUR 6 MONTH OLD VAN WITH ONLY 3800 MILES ALREADY HAD THE MOTOR REPLACE AND CAUGHT ON FIRE. HIS ADVISE DON'T PARK IN THE GARAGE ANYMORE SO WE WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT BURNING DOWN OUR HOUSE. IRONIC THAT WE CHOOSE THIS VAN BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER AND SAFER FOR OUR KIDS.  NOW I FEAR OUR FAMILIES SAFETY EVERYDAY BECAUSE WE HAVE IT.   *AK",
