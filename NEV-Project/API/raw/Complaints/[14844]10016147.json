THE LAST TIME IT WAS ABSOLUTELY IRRITATING BECAUSE THE FUEL GAUGE STILL SHOWED A QUARTER TANK AVAILABLE AND DID NOT GIVE ANY INDICATION OR WARNING OF LOW FUEL. WORSE, THE CAR STOPPED AT THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD WITH NO WARNING WHAT SO EVER.  WORST, WHEN CONTACTING THE DEALER, THEY OFFERED TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE GAS TANK, BUT THEY DID NOT NOTIFY ME AT THAT TIME, THAT THERE IS A KNOWN PROBLEM. THEY DID NOT EVEN CONTACT ME AND INFORM ME THAT THERE IS A SAFETY RELATED PROBLEM AND A RECALL ON THAT VEHICLE!!!    PLEASE CONTACT VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL VOLKSWAGEN NEW PASSAT OWNERS GET INFORMED OF THE SAFETY RELATED RECALL!!!!  IF I WOULD NOT HAVE FOUND YOUR WEBSITE PER PURE INCIDENT, I WOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN OF THIS ACTUAL PROBLEM KNOWN TO VOLKSWAGEN.   *NLM",
