        "summary": "I WAS INVOLVED IN A FRONT AND MOSTLY SIDE COLLISION WHERE MY CAR WAS TOTALED.  A COUPLE OF DAYS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT MY AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON AND THEN WENT OFF.  I TOOK THE CAR (2001 FORD TAURUS SES) TO COWLES FORD IN WOODBRIDGE VA.  I WAS TOLD THE CAR WAS SAFE TO DRIVE AND THAT THE AIRBAGS WOULD DEPLOY PROPERLY IF I WERE INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT.  I MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THE CAR LOOKED AT ON 12/27/02.  THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED BEFORE THE APPOINTMENT AND ONLY ONE SIDE AIRBAG DEPLOYED BUT NOT ON THE SIDE I WAS ON.  I WAS DRIVING, WEARING MY SEATBELT THE SIDE AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY.  DURING THE ACCIDENT I WAS STILL THROWN INTO THE SIDE OF THE CAR EVEN THOUGHT MY SEATBELT WAS WORN.  I SUSTAINED SOME MINOR TO SERIOUS INJURIES AND AM CURRENTLY STILL BEING TREATED FOR THESE.  I HAVE CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY TO REPORT THE PROBLEM SO THAT THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN TO SOMEONE ELSE IN THE FUTURE.  THEY HAVE IGNORED MY PHONE CALLS AND HAVE FAILED TO RESPOND TO MY COMPLAINTS.  I DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY TO FIGHT THIS BUT AM LOOKING FOR ANY HELP FROM YOU IN MAKING SURE THAT THE CARS WE BUY FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SPEND WILL BE SAFE FOR OUR FAMILIES.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.   *NLM",
