AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS, I CANNOT SAFELY MAKE LEFT TURNS AS THE CAR WON'T ACCELERATE IMMEDIATELY AND PASSING IS NOT SAFELY DONE EITHER.  I DO NOT DRIVE IT NOW EXCEPT TO WORK, 2 MILES AWAY, AND LOCALLY.  THE REPAIR SHOP SAID I NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION AND THE COST WILL BE BETWEEN $2,500 TO $3,000.  I HAVE NOT HAD IT FIXED YET.  *TR",
