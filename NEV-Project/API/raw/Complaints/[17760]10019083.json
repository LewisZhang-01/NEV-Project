AT THAT POINT I THOUGHT I WOULD PASS OUT, OR DIE SOON, THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE COULD NOT GET ME OUT.  MY CAR WAS TOTALED, AND STILL UNDER WARRANTY. SUBARU HAS NOT RESPONDED, I AM WITHOUT A CAR. THIS HAS BEEN VERY STRESSFUL FOR ME AND MY FAMILY. WE TRUSTED THE NAME OF SUBARU AND WHAT IT STANDS FOR TILL NOW. AFTER OUR INSURANCE COMPANY SENT A FORENSIC MECHANIC TO INVESTIGATE, IT WAS DETERMINED NOT TO BE ARSON, AND TO BE THE FAULT OF THE MANUFACTURER. WE ALWAYS TOOK VERY GOOD CARE OF THIS CAR SO THIS HAPPENING WAS QUITE A SHOCK TO US AND OUR OTHER FRIENDS THAT OWN SUBARU'S. WE ALL ARE NOT SO PATIENTLY WAITING TO HEAR FROM SUBARU. I WOULD LIKE A NEW CAR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  *JB",
