        "summary": "WE OWN THE LX MODEL WITH THE MANUAL SLIDING DOORS. THE REAR PASSENGER DOOR SEALS HAVE BEEN REPLACED AT LEAST 4 TIMES ON BOTH REAR SLIDING DOORS. THEY STICK MOST OF THE TIME TO THE POINT WE HAVE BROKEN THE DOOR HANDLES OFF WHILE ATTEMPTING TO OPEN THE DOORS. THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE. THE DEALER HAS BEEN VERY WILLING TO REPLACE SEALS ON THE DOORS AT NO CHARGE,  BUT WE ARE CONCERNED THAT IF THERE WERE A NEED TO GET OUR CHILDREN OUT OF THE CAR IN A HURRY, THAT THE DOORS MIGHT NOT OPERATE AT ALL. THERE ARE TIMES I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OPEN THE DOORS AT ALL. THIS IS A FRUSTRATING PROBLEM - AS WELL AS A SAFETY ISSUE. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO FATHOM WHAT IT IS GOING TO COST ME TO HAVE THESE SEALS REPLACED AFTER THE WARRANTY IS UP. YET ONCE THE SEALS FAIL, THE DOORS DO NOT OPEN. WEB SITES LIKE EDMUNDS.COM HAVE SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF ANECDOTAL REPORTS OF ODYSSEY OWNERS WITH CONTINUING PROBLEMS WITH THESE DOORS. SOMEONE COULD EASILY BE TRAPPED IN ONE OF THESE CARS AFTER AN ACCIDENT. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS PROBLEM AND ENCOURAGE HONDA TO FIND A PERMANENT SOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE.  *PH    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**770820",
