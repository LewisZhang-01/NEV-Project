I HAVE ALMOST CAUSED MULTIPLE ACCIDENTS BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE. I COMPLAINED MULTIPLE TIMES TO THE DEALER BUT THEY CLAIMED NOTHING WAS WRONG. AS SOON AS I HIT THE 100,000 MILE MARK THEY ALL OF A SUDDEN HAVE A SOLUTION. THIS SHOULD BE FIXED BY THE DEALER BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF TIMES IT'S BEEN REPORTED. THERE IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING GOING ON WITH THE SWITCH. *TR",
