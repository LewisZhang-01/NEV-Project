        "summary": "I PURCHASED A COSCO SUMMIT BOOSTER CARSEAT ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF CONSUMER REPORTS AND I HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS REGARDING THE STRAPS USED TO SECURE THE CHILD. THE FABRIC IS SO THIN IT DOES NOT LIE FLY AND FOLDS IN HALF GOING THROUGH THE BUCKLE GUIDES. BEACUSE IT IS NOT THICK ENOUGH TO LIE FLAT, IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PULL THE TAB TO GET A TIGHT FIT. I FIND MY CHILD HAS A LOT OF MOVEMENT -- ENOUGH TO REACH DOWN AND PULL THE RELEASE BUTTON. I HAVE ALSO FOUND THAT, SINCE THE SAME FABRIC IS USED TO HOLD THE BUCKLE ASSEMBLY, IT ALSO DOES NOT LIE FLAT AND IT TWISTS AROUND. ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION I HAVE SECURED THE BUCKLE BACKWARDS, WITH THE RED RELEASE BUTTON FACING INTO MY CHILD'S CROTCH AREA. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO RELEASE WHEN THIS HAPPENS. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE STRAPS AND FEAR MANY CHILDREN ARE NOT BEING SECURED SAFELY. THERE SHOULD BE A HIGHER STANDARD USED FOR THIS STRAP FABRIC. MY BRITAX CARSEAT USES A MUCH HEAVIER FABRIC AND HAS NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM. I MUST NOT THAT I HAVE ONLY HAD THIS CARSEAT FOR 2 MONTHS, USED AS A BACK-UP AND ALREADY FEEL THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE DESIGN.  THANK YOU.",
