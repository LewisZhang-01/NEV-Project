THE CONTACT DEPRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL AND FOUND IT TO BE EXTREMELY STIFF.  THE BRAKES WERE INOPERATIVE AND HE EVENTUALLY WAS ABLE TO STOP THE VEHICLE BY DEPRESSING THE BRAKE PEDAL REPEATEDLY WITH GREAT FORCE.  ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THE ABS FAILURES (NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER 96V099000), THE DEALER WOULD NOT MAKE THE NECESSARY REPAIRS BECAUSE THE BRAKE LINE WAS RUSTED.  THE REPAIRS WOULD NOT BE EFFECTIVE UNLESS THE CONTACT PAID TO HAVE THE BRAKE LINE REPLACED AT THE ESTIMATED COST OF $700.  THE FAILURE AND CURRENT MILEAGES WERE 199,000.",
