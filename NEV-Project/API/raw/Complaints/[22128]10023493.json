THE CRUISE LIGHT WOULD NEVER COME ON, NOT EVEN WHEN YOU STARTED THE VEHICLE.  ANYWAY WE COULD GO ANYWHERE FROM 10 MILES TO 100 MILES AND THE CRUISE WOULD AUTOMATICALLY KICK OFF, JERKING THE CAR.  WE CALLED OUR DEALER IMMEDIATELY BUT HE COULD NOT HELP.  WHEN WE GOT BACK FROM VACATION WE TOOK IT UP THERE.  THEY SAID THAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.  ALSO IN THE MANUAL IT SAYS THAT THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FUSE FOR CRUISE: THERE IS NOT ONE.  THEY TEST DROVE ANOTHER ONE THAT WAS ON THEIR LOT AND THAT CRUISE LIGHT DIDN'T WORK EITHER.  I'M JUST WONDERING IS THERE A RECALL ON THIS OR HOW CAN SOMEONE FIX IT.   *NLM",
