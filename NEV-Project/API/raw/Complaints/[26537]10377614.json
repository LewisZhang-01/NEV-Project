IN DECEMBER 2010, ABOUT 3 YEARS AFTER GETTING A NEW TRANSMISSION FROM HONDA, THE NEW TRANSMISSION ALSO WENT BAD.  THE DEALER WILL NOT REPLACE IT FREE STATING THAT I AM OUT OF WARRANTY AT 113,000 MILES NOW AND THAT THE NEW TRANSMISSION THEY PUT DOES NOT COME WITH ANY WARRANTY!  THE DEALER QUOTED $5,285 FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION.  I FEEL THAT HONDA INSTALLED A LEMON TRANSMISSION IN MY VAN THE SECOND TIME AND SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT.",
