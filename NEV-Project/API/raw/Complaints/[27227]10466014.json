IT WOULD ALSO NOT STAY IN THE POSITION AGAINST THE WINDOW TO BLOCK THE SUN.  THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH HYUNDAI'S FOR A LONG TIME AND IN MY OPINION IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  I DID A SEARCH OF THE INTERNET AND IT IS A RECURRING PROBLEM FOR MANY YEARS.  APPARENTLY HYUNDAI IS UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO GET TO THE PROBLEM AND FIX THE SUN VISOR ISSUE.  THIS ISSUE CAUSES A VISIBILITY  PROBLEM AS THE VISOR KEEPS DROPPING INTO THE DRIVER'S FIELD OF VISION! *TR",
