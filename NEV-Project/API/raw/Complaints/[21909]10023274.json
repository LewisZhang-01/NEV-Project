I HAVE HAD SEVERAL PROBLEMS SINCE AND NOTHING CORRECTED.  DASH BOARD LIGHTS/COMPUTER DOES NOT WORK AT TIMES.  VERY LOUD WIND NOISE WHILE DRIVING.  NOW LOUD NOISE COMING FROM ENGINE AND DEALERSHIP CANNOT FIX 100%.  THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE EVER FELT THIS UNSAFE IN ANY VEHICLE.  MANUFACTURER GAVE AND EXTENSION ON THE REPLACED ENGINE BUT THAT DOES NOT MAKE ME FEEL SAFER.  I HAVE CONTACTED MANUFACTURER ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.  WHEN THEY DO NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT ALL THE PROBLEMS, YOU CANNOT COMPLAIN OR GO ANY FURTHER THAN CLERK WORKING ON YOUR CASE.  EVEN IF YOU MAIL IN A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE CLERK, YOUR COMPLAINT WILL ONLY GO AS FAR AS THAT CLERK ASSIGNED TO YOUR CASE.  *JB",
