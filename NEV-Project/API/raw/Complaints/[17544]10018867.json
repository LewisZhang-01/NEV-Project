COMPUTER DIAGNOSIS OF THE TROUBLE CODE READ \"CATALYST DETERIORATION.\"  I HAD THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER REPLACED, AND THE LIGHT CAME BACK ON THREE WEEKS LATER.  THIS TIME, THE TROUBLE CODE SAID THAT THERE WAS A BAD PRIMARY OXYGEN SENSOR.  THIS TOO, WAS REPLACED, AND I AM HOPING THAT THE LIGHT STAYS OFF.  *JB",
