THE NHTSA  INFO ADVISED  BRIDGESTONE WOULD REIMBURSE THE COST OF REPLACEMENT. AS AN INITIAL ACTION, I HAD REQUESTIED A TOTAL REIMBURSEMENT OF THE COST INVOLVED IN THE AMOUNT OF $531.77. THE SUBJECT TIRES WERE INSPECTED BY THEIR AUTHORIZED DEALER ON 2/14/03 AND FOUND TO HAVE CRACKS AS STATED ABOVE. BRIDGESTONES (CASE FILE 534305) RESPONDED WITH AN OFFER OF $100 COUPON ONLY BECAUSE THEY CLAIM THAT THE TIRES WERE MANUFACTURED IN 1994, TIRES WERE NOT ROTATED AT A DEALERSHIP BUT THEY WILL NOT CERTIFY THAT THE TIRE ARE SAFE TO USE. BECAUSE THE TIRES ARE SHOWING CRACKS AT SIMILAR AREAS ON ALL THE TIRES, I FEEL THAT THE CRACKS ARE DUE TO MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND BRIDGESTONE SHOULD AT LEAST REIMBURSE THE COST OF REPLACEMENT.  *JB",
