ACCORDING TO YOUR REPORTS, NHTSA ID #10109246 THE 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA HAD CVT DELAYED ENGAGEMENT WHEN SHIFTING INTO DRIVE OR REVERSE. (THERE WERE ALSO 19 OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THE POWERTRAIN.) I FEEL THAT I SHOULD BE COMPENSATED BY NISSAN FOR THIS. I CONTACTED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND THEY DID NOTHING FOR ME. I SPOKE TO A GIRL NAMED SUMMER WHO IN A MECHANICAL TONE SAID TO ME \"YOUR WARRANTY RAN OUT. THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO\" NOTHING I SAID MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO HER. SHE EVEN CONTACTED THE NISSAN DEALER HOWEVER SHE STILL DID NOT BUDGE AFTER HE TOLD HER ABOUT MY CASE. THIS IS A POOR REPRESENTATION OF NISSAN. THEY DON'T STAND BY THEIR PRODUCT. I WAS VERY UPSET. I'M A SINGLE MOTHER AND I HAVE TO BORROW $4000 AGAINST MY RETIREMENT ACCOUNT JUST TO PAY FOR THIS REPAIR. I FEEL THAT NISSAN SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR PRODUCT AND PAY FOR THEIR FAULTY TRANSMISSION.",
