ALSO, MY TRUNK WOULDN'T OPEN WHEN ONE WOULD USE THE TRUNK RELEASE BUTTON AT TIMES.  I ALSO HAD HIM CHECK MY DIMMING HEADLIGHTS, MY STEERING WHICH HAD A JERK IN IT WHEN I WENT AROUND CURVES, CLICKING SOUND IN ENGINE AND AN OVER ALL CHECK SINCE MY WARRANTY IS ABOUT TO RUN OUT IN 1,000 MILES.    TURN OUT-AFTER LEAVING THE DEALER MY AIR CONDITIONER WAS HUMMING LIKE A HELICOPTER, MY BRAKES WERE HORRIBLE AND GRINDING AND THE CAR FEELS LIKE IT HAS NO GET UP AND GO POWER.    I TOOK MY CAR TO BRAKE CHECK AFTER LEAVING BECAUSE WHEN THE DEALER DID THE OVERALL CHECK OF MY CAR THEY SAID I NEEDED A FRONT BRAKE JOB.  AND THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME OVER 200.00 DOLLARS.  THE DEALER TOLD ME IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER MY WARRANTY.  WELL BRAKE CHECK TOOK OFF ALL FOUR TIRES AND FOUND THAT MY PROBLEM WAS DUE TO LEFT AND RIGHT CALIPER PROBLEMS ON THE INBOARD SIDE AND LEFT REAR HARD WEAR PROBLEMS AND WEAR ON THE OUTBOARD SIDE.  THE CALIPER IS ENGAGING BUT NOT DISENGAGING AND CAUSED MY PADS TO WEAR OUT AND MY ROTORS ARE ATE UP.  THE PADS ARE NOT WORN EVENLY WHICH IS DEFINITELY A SIGN OF CALIPER PROBLEMS.  ALSO, THE DEALER UPON THE OVERALL INSPECTION OF MY CAR SAID THAT MY INTAKE GASKETS WERE RUINED AND LEAKING COOLANT.  THEY SAID THEY REPLACED THEM, HOWEVER I AM AFRAID THAT THERE IS FURTHER DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE THAT THEY ARE NOT TELLING ME, JUST LIKE MY BRAKES.  DUE TO THE FACT THAT STEVE AT LONE STAR TOLD ME THAT IT WAS CAUSED DUE TO LACK OF OILS CHANGES AND GIL SAID IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE GASKETS BEING IMPROPERLY SEATED FROM THE FACTORY OR JUST A DEFECT IN THE GASKET.  WELL IS THIS WHY MY CAR HAS NO GET UP ANYMORE?  MY CAR ALSO MADE A GRINDING SOUND WHEN HITTING BUMPS UNDER THE RIGHT FRONT FENDER AREA THAT NOTHING WAS DONE ABOUT AND MY HEADLIGHT PROBLEM THEY SAID WAS DUE TO A FAULTY BATTERY CABLE.    *NLM",
