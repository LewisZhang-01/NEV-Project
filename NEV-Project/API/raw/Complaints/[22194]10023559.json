I AM NOT SURE WHAT WAS CHANGE OTHER THAN THIS IS A DUAL ZONE SYSTEM BUT IS NOT FOR THE BETTER. I WOULD LIKE IF GMC WOULD CHANGE IT BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS IN 2002, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE SOUTHERN STATES. I AM A PROFESSIONAL AND WHEN I CLIMB INTO MY TRUCK ON A HOT DAY I SOAK A PERFECTLY GOOD SHIRT WAITING ON IT TO COOL DOWN IN THE CAB. THIS IS PATHETIC TO THINK THAT GMC'S SLOGAN IS \"PROFESSIONAL GRADE\" NOT AS FAR AS THE AC!    *NLM",
