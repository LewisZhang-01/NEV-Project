THAT TURNED INTO BLACK SMOKE COMING FROM THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE, UNDERNEATH/BEHIND THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT. FROM THAT SMOKE, A FIRE STARTED IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE, INSIDE THE VEHICLE. I PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE STREET, TURNED THE CAR OFF, GRABBED MY SON WHO WAS IN A CAR SEAT IN THE BACK AND GOT OUT OF THE CAR SAFELY. NOT A MINUTE AFTER WE GOT OUT OF THE CAR, THE ENTIRE CAR WAS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT DID AN INVESTIGATION AND CLASSIFIED IT AS UNDETERMINED, BUT MECHANICAL IN NATURE. WE BOUGHT OUR ACURA BRAND NEW FROM THE DEALER IN 2014 AND HAVE ONLY HAD IT SERVICED AT THE ACURA DEALER. WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY ISSUES WITH THE CAR, OTHER THAN REGULAR MAINTENANCE. I'M EXTREMELY CONCERNED THAT THE CAR WOULD BURST INTO FLAMES WHILE DRIVING.",
