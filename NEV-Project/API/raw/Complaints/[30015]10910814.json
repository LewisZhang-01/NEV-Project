        "summary": "NOTHING BUT TROUBLE SINCE I BOUGHT IT. PURCHASED JAN 2016. HAS REPLACED --- NAVIGATION, AMPLIFIER & FUEL  PUMP!!!  OWNED 2016 MDX FOR LESS THAN A WEEK- VEHICLE JOLTS FORWARD-GIVES ITSELF EXTRA GAS EVEN WHEN YOUR FOOT IS ON THE BRAKE! TRANSMISSION NOT SMOOTH.  BEEN IN FOR SERVICE OVER 40 DAYS NOW (TOTAL). HESITATES SOMETIMES- WAS STUCK AT 15 MPH FOR A FEW MINUTES. RADIO GOES UNRESPONSIVE- NO BUTTONS WORK GETS STUCK AT STATION/VOL CAN'T TURN OFF EITHER. NAVIGATION DIED- TURNED OFF, THEN FLICKERED(WAS REPLACED) . SPEAKERS WENT FLAT- AMPLIFIER DIED (WAS REPLACED). THE ENGINE IDLE FEATURE DOESN'T WORK RIGHT. IT DOESN'T KEEP MY SAMSUNG PHONE CHARGED. I'VE TRIED MULTIPLE CORDS INCLUDING THE ORIGINAL ONE THAT CAME WITH PHONE. ACURALINK DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK EITHER. I SENT A DESTINATION BUT IT DOESN'T SHOW UP FOR A FEW HOURS OR DAYS!  IT TWEETS NOW. THE WINDOW NOW SQUEAKS (NO, IT IS NOT TINTED OR ANYTHING).  IT MAKES A STRANGE DRIPPING NOISE WHEN YOU TURN IT OFF. IT EATS GAS! I FILL IT UP AND IT'S GONE IN A BLINK..NOT THE APPROPRIATE MILES.  IT BEEPS LOUDLY AND BLINKS THAT THERE IS AN OBJECT APPROACHING FOR NO REASON- NO ONE/THING THERE- NOTHING MOVING. IT HAS A MIND OF IT'S OWN.  I'VE BEEN A LOYAL HONDA/ACURA OWNER FOR OVER 18 YEARS AND THEY HAVE NOT HELPED. WHEN THEY REPLACED THE NAVI THEY SAID THEY'D GIVE ME $500 FOR MY TROUBLE- BUT DIDN'T ANYWAY. THEY SAY THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT-- BUT JUST MONDAY SAID IT NEEDS A NEW FUEL PUMP BUT IS \"SO NEW\" THEY DON'T HAVE ONE SO IT HAD TO BE ORDERED. DISGRACEFUL. I ASKED FOR IT TO BE REPLACED- WAS DENIED. ACURA CLIENT REP SAYS- \"AT THIS TIME THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO\"  I HAVE A SPINAL CONDITION AND THE JOLTING HURTS ME GREATLY. SOMEDAYS I CAN'T DRIVE MY BRAND NEW VEHICLE BC I CANT TAKE THE PAIN. THEY DON'T CARE. THEY DON'T STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT EITHER. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED IN VEHICLE AND COMPANY",
