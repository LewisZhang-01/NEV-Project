DEALER WILL REFINISH ROTORS AND INSTALL NEW FRONT BRAKE PADS FOR A TEMPORAIRY REPAIR.  I HAVE DRIVEN 9400 MILES TOTAL ON THIS VEHICLE WITH THREE SET OF FRONT BRAKES REPLACED.  HAVE NOT TOWED ANY TRAILER OR VEHICLE WITH IT TO CAUSE FAILURE.

THIS IS A SEVERE SAFETY ISSUE THAT CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT AND INJURY TO IT'S OCCUPANTS.
