        "summary": "LOCKS ON ALL FOUR PINCH AND IT HURTS.  AFTER THE FIRST TIME YOU CAN DEAL WITH IT.  AFTER THE FIFTH AND SIXTH TIME IT HURTS.  ALSO OTHER PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN IN THE VEHICLE AND HAVE BEEN PITCHED. OTHER FORD DRIVERS SAY THAT THEY ALSO HAVE GOTTEN PINCHED.  EVERYONE KNOWS THAT COFFEE IS HOT.  EVERYONE KNOWS THAT A HAND IN A DOOR WHEN THE DOOR IS CLOSING WILL HURT. IT IS NOT A KNOWN FACT THAT A LOCK WILL PINCH WHEN YOU PUT YOUR ARM UP TO REST AND ACCIDENTALLY LOCK THE DOOR WITH YOUR ARM OR THE AUTOMATIC DOOR LOCK KICKS IN.  I JUST HOPE SOMEONE WILL FIX THIS. I DON'T LIKE THIS ADDED FEATURE TO MY VAN.  I CARRY MY KIDS AND OTHER KIDS IN MY CAR.  PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.  THANKS.  *JB      *****DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****769330",
