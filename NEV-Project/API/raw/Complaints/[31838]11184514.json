THIS CAN CAUSE DASH WARNINGS BUT IF NOT CAN CAUSE THE VEHICLES BRAKES TO OVERHEAT WITHOUT DRIVERS KNOWLEDGE. THE UPGRADED PARTS ARE AVAILABLE FROM PORSCHE AS THE OLD VERSION SPINDLE AND BUSHES ARE FLAWED. I HAVE REPLACED THE PARTS,P99142328400 BEARING PIN / SPINDLE AND BUSHES P7PP721113A. THEY ARE SMALL IN COST BUT COULD PREVENT SERIOUS FAILURE OR INJURY / DEATH.. I LIVE IN UK AND BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO YOU",
