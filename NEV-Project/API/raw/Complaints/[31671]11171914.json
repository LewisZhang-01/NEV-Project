I PULLED OFF THE FREE AND FOUND NO OBJECTS IN THE SUNROOF WELL.  I WENT DIRECTLY TO THE DEALER WHO FELT ANROCK CAUSED THIS AND COULD NOT AND WOULD NOT HELP ME AND SAID HE'D NEVER HEARD OF THAT.  THEY DID NOT EVEN LOG MY VISIT TO THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  I CONTACTED CHRYSLER WHO SAID THEY WILL DO ANYTHING SINCE THE SERVICE TECH AT DEALER LOOKED AT AND SAW NO DEFECT TO THE FRAME.  FORTUNATELY, I HAD MY INTERIOR PORTION OF THE SUNROOF CLOSED AND MAINTAINED CONTROL OF MY VEHICLE.   THIS WAS NOT CAUSED BY ROAD DEBRI OR OTHER PRIOR INCIDENT AND JUST EXPLODED.  I AM REPORTING THIS AS OTHERS MAY BE REFUSED BY THE DEALER AS I WAS AND IT NOT BE INVESTIGATED OR IGNORED.",
