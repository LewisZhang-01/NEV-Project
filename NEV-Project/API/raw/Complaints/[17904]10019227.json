I HAVE RETURNED THE CAR SEVERAL TIMES ABOUT THE CAR WONDERING ALL OVER THE ROAD. THE DRIVER LITERALLY HAS TO FIGHT WITH THE STEERING WHEEL TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE. THE EMPLOYEES AT LEXUS OF MASSAPEQUA, DRIVE THE CAR AND SAY THEY FIND NOTHING WRONG. IF THE PROBLEM IS NOT IN THE FRONT END, THEN THE CAUSE OF THE DANGEROUS STEERING COULD BE THE TIRES. I AM NOT A TECHNICIAN AND DO NOT KNOW A LOT ABOUT MECHANICS. SO I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS CAUSING THE PROBLEM. HOWEVER, IT DOES NOT TAKE A MECHANIC TO RECOGNIZE A DANGEROUS DRIVING HAZARD. I DO FEEL THAT I AM IN DANGER WHEN DRIVING MY LEXUS.   *NLM",
