        "summary": "TRAVELING ON I-5 IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC 0- 60 MPH WHEN TRANSMISSION STARTED SHIFTING ROUGHLY. IT THEN SHIFTED TO NEUTRAL AND WOULD NOT RESPOND TO SHIFTER INPUTS. I WAS IN THE SECOND LANE FROM THE RIGHT DOING 10 OR 15 MPH. I WAS ABLE TO FORCE MY WAY INTO THE RIGHT LANE AND OFF TO THE SHOULDER. I PUT THE TRANSMISSION IN SPORT AND PADDLE SHIFTER MODE WITH NO RESPONSE FROM THE SHIFT SELECTOR. THINKING THIS IS A COMPUTER PROBLEM I REBOOTED BY SHUTTING CAR OFF AND RESTARTING. ALL FUNCTIONS RETURNED TO NORMAL.  TOOK TO DEALER WHERE I GOT VERY GOOD SERVICE BUT IT TURNS OUT THERE WAS A MERCEDES BULLETIN REGARDING THIS PROBLEM. IT REQUIRED A SOFTWARE UPDATE THAT HAS APPEARENTLY FIXED THE PROBLEM. WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WAS VERY MINOR WHEN COMPARED TO WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED LOSING POWER ON THE FREEWAY AND I BELIEVE THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL ON SUCH A SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM. COMPUTER FAULTS THAT WERE FOUND WERE P060600,P073000, P073200, P07300, P073400, P07350008",
