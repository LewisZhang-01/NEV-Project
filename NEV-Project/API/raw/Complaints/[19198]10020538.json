LAST MONTH I PURCHASED A 2003 TOWN AND COUNTRY MINIVAN AND NOW MY WIFE AND I ARE LOOSING SLEEP BECAUSE THE FRONT SEAT HAS GEN 4 BELTS BUT THE MIDDLE AND REAR SEATS STILL HAVE GEN 3 BELTS.  THIS IS WHERE OUR 3 CHILDREN SIT!  HOW CAN YOUR MOTTO BE \"PEOPLE SAVING PEOPLE\" WHEN YOU KNOW THIS INFORMATION BUT DON'T FORCE A CHANGE OR INFORM THE PUBLIC!  WHY WOULD CHRYSLER CHANGE THE FRONT SEATS BUT NOT ALL SEATS?  THAT'S WERE THE MOST VIOLENT REBOUND OCCURS DURING GOVERNMENT CRASH TESTS OCCUR AND THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD GET BY WITHOUT ANY SEAT BELT ANOMALIES IF THEY ONLY MODIFIED THE FRONT SEATS AND SAVED A FEW BUCKS.  YOU ARE NOT SAVING PEOPLE IF YOU DON'T FORCE A RECALL.  ONE LIFE LOST IS ONE TOO MANY.  WE HAVE CONVINCED OUR CHILDREN THE IMPORTANCE OF SEAT BELTS.  NOW THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF SEAT BELTS, THIS INFORMATION SCARES THE HELL OUT OF THEM TOO!  THE INCIDENT WAS THE LAST MONTH WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE BECAUSE YOU FAILED TO INFORM THE PUBLIC.  NOW I MUST UPSIDE DOWN FINANCE TO GET RID OF THE VEHICLE!   *NLM",
