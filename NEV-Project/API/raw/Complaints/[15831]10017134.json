        "summary": "APPROXIMATELY 20 OCCURRENCES OF ANTI-LOCK BRAKE FAILURE IN HARD BRAKING SITUATIONS, RESULTING IN ONE ACCIDENT IN 2002.  AS THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED, THEY WILL CUT OUT AND A HUMMING NOISE CAN BE HEARD FROM THE MOTOR/FRONT OF THE VEHICLE.  SOMETIMES THE BRAKING WILL KICK BACK ON AFTER A MOMENT OR TWO, OTHER TIMES THE BRAKE PEDAL MUST BE RELEASED AND REAPPLIED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE NORMAL BRAKING.  ON THE MAY 2, 2003 INCIDENT, I WAS ATTEMPTING TO STOP AT A RED LIGHT, TRAVELING 25 MPH, CLEAR AND SUNNY DAY, 52 DEGREES.  THE LIGHT CHANGED QUICKLY AND I BEGAN BRAKING.  AS I DEPRESSED THE BRAKE HARDER, THE BRAKES SEEMED TO GIVE OUT AND I HEARD THE HUMMING NOISE.  THE DURANGO SLOWED TO ABOUT 2-5 MPH BUT MAINTAINED THAT SPEED, EVEN WITH THE BRAKE PEDAL FULLY DEPRESSED.  AS I WAS ABOUT TO ROLL INTO THE INTERSECTION, I RELEASED THE BRAKES AND QUICKLY REAPPLIED THEM.  THE DURANGO SHOT FORWARD BRIEFLY, BUT THE BRAKES THEN KICKED IN NORMALLY AND I WAS ABLE TO STOP ALL FORWARD MOMENTUM.  MOST OF THE ABOVE INCIDENTS HAVE BEEN ON SUNNY DAYS, DRY CONDITIONS WITH AN AVERAGE AIR TEMP OF 60 DEGREES.  WE HAVE MENTIONED THIS TO THE DODGE DEALERSHIP THAT MAINTAINS OUR VEHICLE AND THE BRAKING SYSTEM WAS INSPECTED.  THEY STATED THAT THE BRAKES WERE OPERATING WITHIN SPECS AND THAT WITH ABS, THERE WILL BE A PAUSE AS THE ABS KICKS IN.  MY WIFE AND I HAVE BOTH HAD PRIOR VEHICLES WITH ABS AND HAVE NEVER HAD THIS SITUATION BEFORE.   *NLM",
