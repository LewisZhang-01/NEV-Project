CAN GET THEM TO WORK AFTER PLACING A ZIP STRAP AROUND MOTOR AND WIRES AND PULLING REAL TIGHT. THIS LOOKS LIKE AN IDENTICAL PROBLEM THAT A PREVIOUS RECALL WAS PERFORMED ON. I ALSO HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE WIPER MOTOR IN MY 91 CHEVROLETK 3 TIMES. SOMETIMES THEY WOULD WORK. SOMETIMES THEY WOULDN'T. THIS APPARENTLY IS A BIG PROBLEM WITH CHEVROLETR MOTORS AS MY FRIENDS ARE HAVING SIMILAR PROBLEMS AS WELL WITH VARIOUS CHEVY TRUCKS AND BLAZERS.*AK",
