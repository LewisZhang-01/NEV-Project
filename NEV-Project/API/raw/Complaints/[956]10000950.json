I HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS BUT KNEW I HAD TO HAVE IT FIXED BEFORE IT CAUSED A ACCIDENT FROM BRAKE LOCK UP DURING HARD BRAKING. I ULTIMATELY BOUGHT A CD VERSION OF A AUTO REPAIR MANUAL. POPULAR MECHANICS REPAIR SOFTWARE. STILL NO ANSWERS UNTIL I WENT TO THE TSB AND SAFETY RECALL PORTION. I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND MY PROBLEM IN THERE. IT WAS HOW THE WIRING WAS ROUTED IT AND WOULD RUB ON THE GAS LINE AND WEAR THE WIRES DOWN TO CAUSE A SHORT IN RESPECT CAUSE THE ABS SYSTEM TO SHUT DOWN AND NOT OPERATE. I ALSO FOUND A SAFETY RECALL NOTICE ON MINE. BELOW LIST THE RECALLS    BULLETINS FOR 1995 CHEVROLET BERETTA V6-3100 3.1L VIN M SFI    SAFETY RECALLS       TSB NUMBER   ISSUE DATE  TSB TITLE 95C03          SEP 94       RECALL - SUPPORT PANEL OMITTED FROM ROCKER PANEL     GENERAL RECALLS       TSB NUMBER   ISSUE DATE  TSB TITLE 95C08          OCT 94       CAMPAIGN - A/T DEFECTIVE 2ND CLUTCH REACTION PLATE    410103         SEP 94       CAMPAIGN - PRODUCT BULLETIN NUMBERING SYSTEM     I AM ALSO HAVING PROBLEMS INVOLVING THE ENGINE THAT INVOLVES THE SERVICE BULLETINS. I AM OUTRAGED BECAUSE OF 2 REASONS. I PAID A LOT OF HARD EARNED MONEY FOR A VEHICLE WITH THE FAITH THAT THE MANUFACTURER WOULD STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT.. WELL I CALLED THEM TO FIND OUT WHAT I COULD DO TO HAVE THESE PROBLEMS CORRECTED. THEY TOLD ME THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO..IT WAS MY PROBLEM. NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM ONE VERY UPSET CUSTOMER. I NEED TO KNOW WHO I CAN CONTACT ABOUT THIS AND WRITE TO. THIS IS NOT RIGHT. I NEVER GOT A RECALL NOTICE ON MY CAR ABOUT ANY OF THE INVOLVED PROBLEMS. SO NOW I FIND OUT MY CAR COULD BE A DEATH TRAP. FROM WHAT I HAVE READ ON THE INTERNET THE ROCKER PANEL INVOLVES SIDE IMPACTS AND COULD CAUSE SOMEONE SERIOUS INJURY FOR WHOEVER IS DRIVING THIS TYPE OF CAR. TS",
