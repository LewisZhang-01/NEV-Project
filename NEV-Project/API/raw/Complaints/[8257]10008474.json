        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING IN A SLOW RAIN, THE DRIVERS SIDE WIPER ARM CAME LOOSE AND FLEW ALL THE WAY PAST THE WINDSHIELD TO THE LEFT OF THE VEHICLE.  ALTHOUGH IT WAS STILL ATTACHED, IT WOULD NOT MOVE.  FORTUNATELY I WAS LESS THAT A MILE FROM HOME AND DROVE THE VEHICLE HOME.  MY HUSBAND GOT A WRENCH, REPOSITIONED THE WIPER ARM AND TIGHTENED IT DOWN.  I WAS ABLE TO THEN GO TO WORK.  I CONTACTED MY DEALER ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND HE TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE THAT HAPPEN QUITE OFTEN WITH THIS MODEL AND THAT I SHOULD CARRY A 13 MM WRENCH WITH ME SO IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN I COULD FIX IT LIKE MY HUSBAND HAD.  HE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE THE VEHICLE IN HIS SHOP OR WRITE A TICKET FOR IT.  THEY TOLD ME IT WAS CONSIDERED NORMAL BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE VEHICLES DID THIS.  MY CONCERN IS FOR SAFETY,  IF THIS HAD BEEN A HARD RAIN STORM AND I HAD BEEN GOING 60 OR 65 MPH WHEN THIS OCCURRED, IT COULD HAVE CAUSED A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT.  I BELIEVE THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO AS THE DEALER SAYS THAT THIS PROBLEM IF VERY COMMON FOR THIS MODEL. *JB",
