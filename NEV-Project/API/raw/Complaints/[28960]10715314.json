        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING AT ABOUT 50MPH AT NIGHT WHEN ALL ELECTRICAL CUT OFF INCLUDING MY HEADLIGHTS I WAS TRAVELING IN THE DARKNESS AT THAT SPEED HARDLY ABLE TO SEE THANKS TO A CAR BEHIND ME AND PULLED OFF THE ROAD. JEEP HAS BEEN STALLING WAY TOO MUCH AS WELL AS CRANKING FOR 3 SECONDS AND RUNNING AND THEN CUTTING OFF INSTANTLY THE ONLY WAY I CAN FIX THESE PROBLEMS IS UNHOOK BATTERY EVERY TIME AND WITHIN MAYBE MINUTES IT MAY OCCUR AGAIN.....THIS IS ALL DIRECTLY CONNECTED WITH THE P41 RECALL IGNITION SWITCH ISSUES ON THESE JEEPS THAT I WAS SENT NOTICE ALMOST A YEAR AGO. WHAT'S THE HOLD UP ON THESE PARTS!? LET'S GET MOVING....THIS IS MY ONLY VEHICLE AND I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE DRIVING OR FEEL RELIABLE ABOUT GETTING FROM POINT A TO B. I'VE SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON THIS VEHICLE SO FAR BECAUSE OF THESE TYPE ISSUES. HERE IS A LINK TO ONE OF THE PROBLEMS OCCURING WITH MY JEEP. PAY CLOSE ATTENTION, THIS COULD GET SOMEONE KILLED!
