THE NEW TIRES WERE PROPERLY INSTALLED AND BALANCED BY DISCOUNT TIRE, BUT MY VEHICLE STILLS TRACKS TO THE RIGHT. I CANNOT LET GO OF THE STEERING WHEEL FOR A SECOND WITHOUT IT WANTING TO CHANGE LANES WHEN I AM GOING STRAIGHT. I'VE TAKEN MY VEHICLE TO THE DEALER THREE TIMES ALREADY AND HAD THE SERVICE CAMPAIGN PERFORMED. THE CONDITION OF THE ROAD IS NOT THE ISSUE HERE, AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD TIME AND TIME AGAIN. I HAVE ALSO FOUND REPORTS OF THIS TRACKING ISSUE ONLINE. THE CAR IS STILL PULLING TO THE RIGHT 60 - 70 PERCENT OF THE TIME, AND IS A CONSTANT STRUGGLE TO CONTROL. THIS IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT WHEN I AM TRAVELING AT SPEEDS OF 45MPH, OR HIGHER. IF I HIT THE SLIGHTEST IMPERFECTION IN THE ROAD; THE CAR WILL BOUNCE ALL OVER THE PLACE. IT STILL SEEMS TO BE TRACKING PRIMARILY TO THE RIGHT, BUT THE TRACKING OF THIS CAR IS SO ERRATIC. I HAVE INCLUDED SEVERAL RELIABLE SOURCES BELOW, WHICH FURTHER EXPLAIN THE ISSUE I AM EXPERIENCING.  *TR",
