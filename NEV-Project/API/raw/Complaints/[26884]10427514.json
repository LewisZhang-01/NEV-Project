SOMETIMES TURNING THE CAR OFF AND RE-STARTING WILL RESOLVE THE PROBLEM, OTHER TIMES IT DOES NOT. REPORTED THE ISSUE TO THE DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND BEFORE I COULD FINISH THE SENTENCE THE TWO SERVICE WRITERS SAID THERE WAS NOT ISSUE WITH THE POWER STEERING PUMP!     WITHOUT THE POWER ASSIST THE STEERING IS VERY HEAVY. AS A STRONG, EXPERIENCED DRIVER I KNEW WHAT TO DO WHEN THE POWER ASSIST FAILED, BUT THIS WOULD BE VERY DANGEROUS FOR AN OLDER OR LESS PHYSICAL DRIVER SINCE THE ASSIST FAILURE IS SUDDEN AND WITHOUT WARNING. AS A DRIVER YOU GO FROM BEING ABLE TO CASUALLY STEER WITH MINIMAL INPUT TO INSTANTLY NEEDING TO FORCEFULLY TURN THE STEERING WHEEL TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE CAR!!!!     THE CAR CURRENTLY HAS 40,011 MILES AND CONTINUES TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM INTERMITTENTLY.   *TR",
