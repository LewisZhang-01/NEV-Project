WHEN THE ROTORS START DETERIORATING THE WHOLE CAR SHAKES, SHIMMIES AND IS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED.  THIS IS DANGEROUS AND SEEMS AN UNNECESSARY EXPENSE FOR THE PRICE OF THE VEHICLE.  ALL JEEP DEALERS WILL TELL YOU THEIR ROTORS ARE BAD, BUT I DON'T  SEE ANY CONSUMER HELP OR IMPROVEMENT PROVIDED BY THE DEALERS.  THEY AND CHRYSLER CORP. REFUSE TO PAY FOR THIS RECURRENT PROBLEM.   *NLM",
