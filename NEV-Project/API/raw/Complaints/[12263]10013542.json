MANAGED TO GET IT OVER IN A EMPTY TURNING LANE, TURNED EVERYTHING OFF, PUT IT BACK IN PARK AND IT STARTED RIGHT UP.  LUCKILY I WAS ONLY 2 MILES FROM THE DEALERSHIP.  BEFORE PURCHASING, SALESMAN ASSURED ME THAT THE \"STALLING\" PROBLEM THAT OCCURRED ON EARLIER MODELS WAS CORRECTED WITH THE 2003 MODEL.  APPARENTLY NOT.   I DRIVE IN HEAVY TRAFFIC TO AND FROM WORK - THIS HAPPENED GOING TO WORK, BEEN IN VEHICLE ABOUT 30 MINUTES.   *NLM",
