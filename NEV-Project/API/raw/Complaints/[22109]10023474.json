THAT IS WHEN THE \"BRAND NEW TRUCK DIED\" IT WAS DUE TO THE SAME REASONS SENSOR AND OTHER PROBLEM.  IT HAD BEEN IN THE MOSS DODGE DEALERSHIP SINCE JUNE 13, 2003 . TODAY IS JUNE 20, 2003 WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THEM SINCE TUESDAY. AS WE WHERE DRIVING ON THE 10 FWY THE TRUCK DIED COMPLETELY WITH THE TRAFFIC BEHIND US IN THE FAST LANE ON THE FREEWAY. I BELIEVE THAT THIS TRUCK IS NOT REPAIRABLE. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS TO MUCH WRONG WITH THIS TRUCKS SENSOR WHICH GIVE THE POWER TO DRIVE.  THIS TRUCK TO ME AND MY FAMILY IS CONSIDER DANGEROUS TO DRIVE FROM THE EXPERIENCE WE HAD ON JUNE 13, 2003. WE HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING BUT NOT EVEN THE GENERAL MANAGER HAS CALLED US BACK. WE EVEN ASKED FOR A CORP. OFFICE THEY SAID THEY DID NOT HAVE ONE. WHICH IS HARD TO BELIEVE.   *NLM",
