SEAT BELTS ARE TWISTED OR FAIL TO RETRACT. FRONT DOORS HAVE SHIFTED DOWNWARD. REAR POWER RECLINING SEAT IS STUCK IN DOWN POSITION.  WAS STRUCK ON FRONT PASSENGERS SIDE WHILE TRAVELING ABOUT 55MPH AIR BAG DID NOT DEPLOY.  RECENTLY HAD TO HAVE EGR VALVE REPLACED ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT MY 1995 VAN HAD 1996 PARTS.  COULD NOT FIND THIS PART IN ANY AUTO PARTS STORE IN TOWN SO I ENDED UP HAVING TO GO TO SALVAGE TO GET ONE FOR $50, IT WAS ALMOST $200.00 NEW AND EVEN AFTER WAITING A WEEK FOR THE PART THE AUTO PARTS STORE DID NOT GET ONE.  THE HINGES FOR MY VAN ARE $43 EACH AND I AM SURE OTHERS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE DEALERSHIP SAYS THIS SHOULD BE EXPECTED BECAUSE OF THE SNOW AND SALT IN OUR STATE.  IT JUST SEEMS CHEVROLET SHOULD HAVE REDESIGNED THESE HINGES.",
