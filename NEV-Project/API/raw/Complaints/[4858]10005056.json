I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO THE ORIGINAL DEALER IN CORYDON, INDIANA. THAT I HAVE PURCHASED 2 OTHER VEHICLES FROM.  THEY ARE TELLING ME THAT I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR EITHER ALL THE COST OF REPAIRS, OR THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET CHRYSLER TO PAY HALF. I THINK THIS EXTREMELY UNFAIR. I HAVE HAD REAR DIFFERENTIAL VEHICLES WITH WELL OVER 100,000 MILES THAT ARE STILL MOVING WITH NO DIFFERENTIAL FAILURES. WHEN IS SOMEONE GOING TO MAKE THESE CAR COMPANIES STAND BEHIND THERE PRODUCT. THANKS, FOR YOUR TIME. RLC.   *JB",
