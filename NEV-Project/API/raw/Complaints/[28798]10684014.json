        "summary": "2/17/2015 WAS THE SECOND EVENT. I WAS DRIVING APPROX- 65 MPH UP A MOUNTAIN WHEN MY ELECTRONIC DISPLAY PANEL SHOWED STABILITRACK/SERVICE TRACTION CONTROL/VEHICLE IN REDUCED POWER. AS THE POWER SUDDENLY REDUCED I LOST POWER STEERING CONTROL AND BRAKE FUNCTION. SINCE I WAS TRAVELING AT A UP HILL GRADE, I WAS BARELY ABLE TO JERK THE STEERING WHEEL ENOUGH TO ROLL ACROSS THE LANE OF TRAFFIC BESIDE ME TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. I WASN'T ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE ROAD COMPLETELY AND WAS ALMOST HIT BY A LOGGING TRUCK. AFTER REMOVING THE KEYS FROM THE IGNITION FOR A FEW MINUTES, I RESTARTED THE CAR WITHOUT ANY HESITATION. THE ENGINE LIGHT STILL REMAINS ON AT THIS TIME. I DID CONTACT ONSTAR AND HAVE THEM RUN A DIAGNOSTIC TEST WHICH REVEALED A PROBLEM WITH SUPPOSED FUEL SYSTEM. I HAVE NOT TAKEN IT TO A DEALERSHIP YET.  AFTER SO MANY COMPLAINTS ON VARIOUS SITES THAT I HAVE REVIEWED, LOOKS LIKE GM WOULD DO A RECALL AND INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE LOSES THEIR LIFE.   *TR",
