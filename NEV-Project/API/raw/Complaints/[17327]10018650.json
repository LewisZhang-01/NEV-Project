WE ENDED UP HAVING TO PUT IN TWO CONTAINERS OF TRANSMISSION FLUID EVERY 30 MINUTES. THE CARS BEHIND US HAD TRANSMISSION FLUID ALL OVER THEIR WINDSHIELDS.  I HAD THIS CAR FOR AROUND A YEAR AND A HALF AND HAVE ALREADY HAD THE TRANSMISSION FIXED ONCE, AND NOW IT'S DUE FOR ANOTHER FIX. I THINK THIS IS HORRIBLE WITH THE AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE AND TRANSMISSION. THERE NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING DONE ABOUT THIS.*JB",
