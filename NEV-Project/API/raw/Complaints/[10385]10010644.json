WHILE JUST OUT OF WARRANTY, AND OBVIOUSLY A DEFECT AS IT IS AFFECTING SO MANY VEHICLES, THE DEALER WILL NOT COVER ANY OF THE REPAIRS BECAUSE IT HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED BY GM.  WITH THE VAST NUMBER OF FAILURES OF THIS PART, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A DESIGN FLAW THAT NEEDS TO BE RECALLED.  THE WORST PART OF THIS DEFECT, IS THERE IS NO WARNING THAT IT WILL HAPPEN AND ONCE IT HAS LEAKED COOLANT INTO THE ENGINE, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THE FUTURE LIFE OF THE ENGINE HAS NOT BEEN COMPROMISED.  PLEASE ASSIST US IN FORCING GM TO OWN UP TO THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM.  *JB",
