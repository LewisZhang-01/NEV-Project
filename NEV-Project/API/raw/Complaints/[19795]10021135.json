I WAS A MECHANIC FOR 10 YEARS PRIOR TO GETTING OUT OF THE BUSINESS.  *AK    IN ALL MY YEARS OF FIXING CARS, I NEVER HAD TO REPLACE STEEL LINES ON THE RACK AND PINION UNIT.  ON MY REGAL, I HAD TO REPLACE THE LONGER OF THE TWO (NOT THE POWER STEERING HOSES, BUT THE STEEL LINES ON THE RACK ITSELF).  EVEN THE FOLKS AT THE DEALER COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT I HAD TO REPLACE THIS PARTICULAR LINE.  SINCE MY CAR IS OUT OF  WARRANTY, HAS THEIR BEEN ANY RECALL ON THIS LINE?  CAN I GET RE-IMBURSED FOR MY TROUBLES?    SINCERELY,  RICHARD ZIELENSKI  ATI2D1@ADELPHIA.NET  RICHARD.ZIELENSKI@ALCOA.COM  216-641-5090",
