        "summary": "MY 09 CORVETTE BASE MODEL LT1'S TAIL LIGHTS WENT OUT AFTER I REMOVED AND REINSTALLED THE FUSE BLOCK. I CHECKED ALL FUSES AND RELAYS AND THEY SHOW TO BE GOOD. BRAKE LIGHTS WORK AS SHOULD AS WELL AS TURN SIGNALS BUT ALL FIVE TAIL LIGHTS WILL NOT ILLUMINATE WHEN TURN ON. UPON FURTHER RESEARCH THIS SHOWS TO BECOMING A MORE COMMON PROBLEM AMONG EARLY C6 MODEL CORVETTES. TAILIGHTS WILL RANDOMLY GO OUT AND PROCESS TO BE A TAIL LIGHT HARNESS ISSUE. I HAVE TALKED TO A LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND THEY SHOW TO NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS OF SAFETY RECALLS ON FILE FOR THE ISSUE. I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE FOR THE DRIVERS AND FELLOW DRIVERS ON THE ROAD. THE DEALERSHIP ALSO DOES NOT KNOW THE ISSUE OR  SOLUTION TO THE ISSUE. I WANT TO AT LEAST NOTE THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO ADDRESSED FOR SAFETY CONCERNS AND LOOKED INTO FOR POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO THE ISSUE.",
