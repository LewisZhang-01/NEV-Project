        "summary": "I HAVE A 1998 VW BEETLE.  I BOUGHT THE BEETLE NEW.  THE HEADLIGHTS HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE THE CAR HAD 15,000 MILES. THE FIRST TIME I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT GET THE LIGHT TO REMAIN OUT, HOWEVER SINCE I HAD REPORTED IT THEY WOULD HONOR THE WARRANTY ON IT IF IT WENT OUT AGAIN. IT DID THE MONTH THE WARRANTY RAN OUT.  THEY REFUSED TO HONOR THE WARRANTY.  I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH VW AND THEY SAID SETTLED IT WITH THE DEALER.  AFTER GOING BACK AND FORTH I FINALLY PAID 80.00 TO GET IT REPAIRED.  TWO MONTHS AFTER THE FIRST HEADLIGHT WENT OUT THE OTHER HEADLIGHT QUIT COMPLETELY.  I TOOK IT BACK WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT. THEY TOLD ME THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE HEADLIGHTS AND VW WOULD ADDRESS THE PROBLEM LATER.  BEING STUBBORN, I HAVE NOT REPAIRED THE HEADLIGHT. THE CAR NOW HAS 52000 MILES ON IT. I THINK THEY SHOULD PAY ME FOR THE FIRST REPAIR AND ALSO REPAIR THE SECOND HEADLIGHT.  VW IS VERY AWARE OF THE ISSUE AS I HAVE SPOKEN WITH NUMEROUS OTHER OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM WHO OWN 98'S AND 99'S.   *JB",
