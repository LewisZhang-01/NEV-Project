WE NOTICED NOISE COMING FROM THE TRUCK AND WHEN THE DEALERSHIP TOOK THE TRUCK FOR ROAD INSPECTION THEY SAID IS THE TIRES. AND OF COURSE, THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE, THAT I HAVE TO GO WITH GOODYEAR CO. AND MAKE A CLAIM. WE USED THE TRUCK TO DRIVE TO AND FROM WORK ONLY! WE DO NOT TAKE THE TRUCK OFF ROAD OR EVEN TO OUR NEIGHBOR COUNTRY (MEXICO) BECAUSE OF ROAD CONDITIONS THERE.THE TIRES ARE WEARING UNEVENLY AND MAKE THIS TERRIBLE NOISE WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS ? WE TAKE THE TRUCK EVERY 3000 MILES FOR OIL CHANGE TO THE DEALERSHIP, THEY WILL RECOMMEND TIRE ROTATION AT 6000 MILES OR SO, WE DO AS THEY RECOMMEND, BUT NOW, NO ONE IS HELPING OUT!  HOW COME THEY DID NOT NOTICE THIS EARLY WEAR IN OUR TIRES?.  *TR",
