SOMETIMES THE VEHICLE WILL START THE FIRST TIME, AFTER THE CAR HAS FIRST BEEN STARTED, BUT MORE OFTEN IT WILL NOT.    VEHICLE TAKEN TO DEALER WHO COULD NOT FIND ANY ENGINE CODES BUT ADVISED ME THAT THE NEGATIVE BATTERY CABLE WAS LOOSE AND THEREFORE NOT COMMUNICATING TO THE COMPUTER PROPERLY.  VEHICLE DRIVEN FROM DEALERSHIP, STOPPED, AND THIRTY MINUTES LATER IN TRYING TO START, IT TOOK TWO CRANKS OF THE IGNITION.  WENT BACK TO DEALER WHO THEN ADVISED THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS HAPPENING IN OTHER CHEVROLET MODELS.  ADVISED THAT THEY WOULD CONTACT GM TO SEE OF A FIX AND ADVISE ME.  AFTER SEVERAL DAYS ON NO RESPONSE FROM THE DEALER, WENT BACK AND WAS TOLD THIS TIME THAT GM WOULD HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A FIX OR SOMETHING. BUT KEEP CHECKING WITH THEM. I CAN HARDLY WAIT TO GET MY QUESTIONAIRE ABOUT CUSTOMER SATISFACTION OF REPAIRS.",
