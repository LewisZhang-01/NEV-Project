I LOOKED DOWN AND OIL WAS ALL OVER MY ENGINE, MY SWINGARM, AND MY REAR TIRE.  I LUCKILY CAUGHT IT (THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME) BEFORE CRASHING.    PRELIMINARY TESTS REVEALED POOR COMPRESSION, AND MANY OTHER DUCATI 998 OWNERS HAVE REPORTED THIS PROBLEM, AND THE CAUSE WAS FOUND TO BE POOR COMPRESSION, RESULTING IN BLOWBY, CAUSING OIL TO SHOOT OUT OF THE ENGINE BREATHER VALVE.  BIKE IS NOW IN THE SHOP FOR FURTHER RESEARCH AND REPAIR.  I CANNOT REACH DUCATI NORTH AMERICA FOR ANY INFORMATION.    *NLM",
