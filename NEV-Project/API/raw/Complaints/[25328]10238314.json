        "summary": "WE PARK OUR CAR UNDER THE UNIT WE LIVE IN, THE CARPORT UNDER THE UNIT IS A CONCRETE SLAB ,WE PULLED UP UNDER THE UNIT TURN THE CAR OFF AND PROCEEDED UPSTAIRS AND HEARING A LOUD NOISE WE WENT BACK DOWN STAIRS AND THE CAR HAD ROLLED OFF THE CONCRETE SLAB DOWN TO THE CANAL WE LIVE ON AND OVER THE DOCK AND INTO THE WATER.  THE CAR WAS NOT ON NOR WERE THE KEYS LEFT IN THE CAR.  CONSEQUENCES THE VEHICLE WAS IN THE WATER FOR ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE WRECKING SERVICE WAS ABLE TO RETRIEVE IT OUT.  THE ADJUSTER TOLD ME THAT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE TOTAL BECAUSE OF THE ENGINE BEING IN THE WATER FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME. PRIOR TO THIS APPROXIMATELY 45 TO 60 DAYS MY EMERGENCY FLASHER STARTED COMING ON BY THEMSELVES AND WOULD GO OFF TEMPORARY FOR ABOUT 5 TO 10 MINUTES AFTER I TURN THEM OFF AGAIN, AGAIN,AGAIN,  I CALLED THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND TALKED TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND THE GENTLEMEN I TALKED TO NEVER HEARD OF THAT BEFORE AND ADVISE ME TO TAKE THE FUSE OUT AND IT SHOULD STOP.  I HAD TO TAKE THE FUSE OUT WHICH IN TURN  TOOK AWAY MY TURNING SIGNALS.  I TOOK THEM OUT FOR 24 HOURS IT DID NOT STOP.  I LEFT THE FUSE OUT FOR 72 HOURS AND IT STOP.      WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS IN THE WATER THE CAR WAS HALF ON THE DOCK AND HALF IN THE WATER WITH 1/3 OF THE HOOD COVER IN WATER THE STARTER TRIED TO TURN OVER, THE RADIO CAME ON, AND THE BRAKE LIGHTS OR BACK UP LIGHTS CAME ON.  THE WRECKER SERVICE TOLD ME THE CAR WAS IN GEAR AND IT SHOULD NOT HAVE ROLLED.  THE VEHICLE IS A 6 SPEED AND NOT AN AUTOMATIC.  I BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING CAUSE THE CAR TO JUMP ENOUGH TO ROLL OFF THE CONCRETE SLAB AND AT THAT POINT GRAVITY TOOK OVER.  THE CAR HAD BEEN TURNED OFF AND THE KEYS REMOVED.  *TR",
