I HAD ASKED THEM TO CHECK OUT THE SHAKING THAT I EXPERIENCED DURING BRAKING. THEY INFORMED ME ALL FOUR ROTORS ARE WARPED AND THE SURFACE COULD NOT BE CUT BECAUSE THEY WOULD BECOME TOO THIN.  AT THIS POINT THE DEALERSHIP WANTS ME TO SPEND $800.00 TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. BEING THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND FROM WHAT I HAVE READ ON THE INTERNET A WIDESPREAD ISSUE WITH THE ROTORS THAT IT SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY.*JB",
