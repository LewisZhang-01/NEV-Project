        "summary": "THERE CURRENTLY IS A RECALL ON CERTAIN 2011 KIA SPORTAGES WITH THE ENGINE BEARINGS PREMATURELY WEARING AND CAUSING THE ENGINE TO SEIZE.  I HAVE A 2011 SPORTAGE THAT IS SHOWING SIGNS OF THIS. TWICE, MY SPORTAGE HAS JUST SHUT DOWN WHILE MY SON WAS DRIVING IT.  LUCKILY,HE WAS ABLE TO COAST OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND WAIT FOR HELP.  THERE IS NO INDICATOR THAT THE ENGINE IS GOING TO SHUT OFF.  AFTER TAKING IT TO MY MECHANIC, AND HIM LOOKING INTO THE PROBLEM, HE TOLD ME THAT THIS LOOKS LIKE THE RECALL PROBLEM THAT KIA HAS ON THESE VEHICLES.  UNFORTUNATELY, AFTER LOOKING INTO THIS MYSELF, THE RECALL DOES NOT INCLUDE MY VIN NUMBER, SO, I WAS TOLD BY MY KIA SERVICE MANAGER THAT KIA MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING.  MY MECHANIC AND I ARE ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THE PROBLEM I AM HAVING WITH MY CAR IS WHY THERE IS A RECALL.  THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING AND HAVE NO IDEA WHEN THE ENGINE IS GOING TO SHUT OFF.  I HAVE 126,700 MILES ON MY CAR AND I KNOW THAT THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED.  THEREFORE, I AM LOOKING AT THE RECALL AND WONDERING IF THERE ARE MORE CARS OUT THERE THAT ARE JUST SHUTTING OFF ON THEM.  PLEASE ADVISE WHAT I CAN DO AND WHY ISN'T MY VIN NUMBER INCLUDED IN THIS RECALL IF IT IS ALSO SHOWING THE SAME SIGNS.",
