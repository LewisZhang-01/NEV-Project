THE TIRE DID CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO THE STORAGE COMPARTMENT DIRECTLY BEHIND THE TIRE. TWO EST. ONE WAS $2072, THE OTHER AT $2405.  I CALLED FIRESTONE CUSTOMER SERVICE. THEY GAVE ME A CLAIM NUMBER AND TOLD ME TO SEND THEM THE TIRE. FINALLY AFTER NINE MONTHS AND EIGHT PHONE CALLS ,I WAS TOLD THAT THE TIRE FAILED BECAUSE IT HAD HIT AN OBJECT OR POT HOLE ETC.  I SAY BC TO THAT! THEY REFUSED MY CLAIM FOR REPAIR, TIRE REPLACEMENT, AND UPS COST, TO SHIP TIRE TO THEM. TOTAL $2235.  BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE! THE COACH CAME NEW FROM THE FACTORY WITH SIX ON THE GROUND AND ONE AS A SPARE. I HAVE LOST ALL SEVEN OF THEM FROM SEPARATION IN 40,000 MILES OF DRIVING. STARTING 4-01 THRU 29-03. THE FIRST SIX CAUSED NO DAMAGE TO THE MH.  I WILL NEVER DEAL WITH OR OWN FIRESTONE TIRES AGAIN!    *NLM",
