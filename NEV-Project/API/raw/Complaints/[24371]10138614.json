WE GOT THE CAR HOME AT WHICH POINT MY HUSBAND JACKED UP THE CAR AND TOOK OFF THE TIRES.  HE FOUND THAT THE COIL SPRINGS WERE BROKEN ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CAR.  WE TOOK THE CAR TO OUR LOCAL SERVICE CENTER. IT COST ME 600.00 TO FIX THE SPRINGS, ALIGNMENT AND THE 2 TIRES THAT WORE UNEVENLY.  WE CALLED THE LOCAL FORD DEALER TO GET PRICING BUT THEY WERE A LOT MORE THAN OUR LOCAL SERVICE CENTER.  THIS IS NOT THE FIRST MAJOR PROBLEM I HAVE HAD WITH THE TAURUS.  *NM",
