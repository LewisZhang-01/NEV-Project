MY HORN UNEXPECTEDLY WILL NOT WORK, MY MONITOR STOPPED WORKING AND WAS REPLACED (OCT 2018) BUT NOW IT BLINKS OFF AND ON, AND I WOULD REPLACE MY EXTERIOR LIGHTS ALMOST EVERY 2-3 MONTHS. RECENTLY (NOV 2018) I WAS TOLD  MY BRAKE LIGHTS WERE OUT SO I WENT TO REPLACE THEM AT AUTOZONE AND WAS TOLD MY LIGHT CASES ARE MELTED AS WELL AS THE BULB HOLDER IS BURNT.   I HAVE ONLY HAD THIS CAR FOR 1 YEAR AND 10 MONTHS. SINCE PURCHASING THIS CAR I HAVE REPLACED MY CV JOINTS 4 TIMES, HAD A NEW MONITOR PUT IN THE CAR, NEW ENGINE AND OTHER RECALLS COMPLETED ON THIS CAR. I FEEL IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE MANUFACTURER COMPLETELY RECALL THIS MODEL YEAR FOR SAFETY REASONS.",
