TODAY THE TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM INDICATED A LOW TIRE. PASSENGER REAR TIRE WAS 23.5 POUNDS. AS I WAS PUTTING AIR IN THE TIRE, THE VALVE STEM LITERALLY SHEARED OFF CAUSING COMPLETE LOSS OF AIR AND A FLAT TIRE. I WENT TO THE DEALER AND THE TIRE PRESSURE SENSOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. OUT OF POCKET COST: $130.78.    UPON INSPECTION OF THE VALVE STEM, GALVANIC CORROSION CAN BE CLEARLY SEEN. PHOTO AVAILABLE ON REQUEST.  *TR",
