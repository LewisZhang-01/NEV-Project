I THOUGHT MAYBE I ACCIDENTALLY PUT IT IN NEUTRAL, BUT NO.  SO I PUT IT BACK INTO PARK, TURNED THE CAR OFF AND REMOVED THE KEY.  I TRIED AGAIN WITH THE SAME RESULT.  IT WOULD NOT GO INTO REVERSE.  DRIVE WORKED JUST FINE.  THERE WAS NO WARNING WHATSOEVER.  NO LIGHTS, SOUNDS, OR INDICATION THAT ANYTHING WAS WRONG.  I AM REALLY TICKED OFF.  I HAD TO GET PUSHED BACK AND THEN I COULD DRIVE OFF.  RECALL PLEASE. *TR",
