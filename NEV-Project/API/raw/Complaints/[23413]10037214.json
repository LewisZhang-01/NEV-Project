THE CAR JUMPED FORWARD IN PARK WHEN WE RESTARTED IT AND THEN IT WOULD NOT RESPOND WHETHER WE TRIED TO PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE OR REVERSE.  THIS IS A 2001 VEHICLE NOW IN NEED OF A REFABBED TRANSMISSION FOR A WHOPPING $2700!  THE DEALER NEVER OPENED  THE TRANSMISSION TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT WENT WRONG (THEY GUESS IT'S THE GEAR SET) AND THEY REFUSE TO LET US GET A 3RD PARTY TO EXAMINE IT.  THEY WILL CHARGE US A $700 NON-REFUNDABLE CORE FEE EVEN IF WE RETURN THE CORE TO THEM IN A TIMELY MANNER.  ALSO, THE TIME TABLE FOR THEM TO RETURN THE PART TO GM JUST WENT TO 24 HOURS.  ORIGINALLY THEY SAID IT USUALLY TAKES AROUND A WEEK FOR THEM TO SEND THE PART BACK!*AK",
