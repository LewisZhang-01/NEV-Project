        "summary": "THE FIRST MAJOR PROBLEM I HAD WITH THIS TRAILBLAZER I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AT 65 MPH WHEN FOR SOME REASON THE 4WD DECIDED TO SHIFT INTO 4 LOW ON ITS OWN. WELL, THIS RIPPED OUT THE CV JOINT HALF SHAFT ON ONE SIDE, DESTROYED THE TRANSFER CASE INTERNALS AND BROKE OFF THE AXLE HOUSING FROM THE ALUMINUM OIL PAN ON THE ENGINE. OK, I GOT THAT FIXED, ADDED A NEW SELECTOR SWITCH, THEN A FEW THOUSAND MILES LATER THE TRANSMISSION GOES OUT WHILE I'M ON THE INTERSTATE. IT WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED INSIDE. THE TRANSMISSION SHOP HAD TO FIND A NEW CORE BECAUSE MINE LOOKED LIKE A BOMB HAD WENT OFF INSIDE IT. SO , I'M THINKING IT COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE FIRST PROBLEM, MAYBE A DELAYED REACTION? OK, WE GET A REBUILT TRANSMISSION IN IT AND JUST OUT OF WARRANTY IT GOES OUT AGAIN. NO TOWING MIND YOU, JUST EASY HIGHWAY MILES WITH A MIND ON TRYING TO GET THE BEST FUEL MILEAGE POSSIBLE BY DRIVING LIKE THERE WAS AN EGG BETWEEN MY FOOT AND THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL. SO, I GO TO ANOTHER TRANSMISSION SHOP THIS TIME. MAYBE THE FIRST GUY DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB I'M THINKING. SO THE 2ND TRANSMISSION GUY TELLS ME THAT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR THE 4L60E TO GO OUT LIKE THAT, THEY'RE GARBAGE. SO HE PUTS ME IN A NEW TRANNY. WELL, SURE ENOUGH 6 MONTHS LATER IT LOST 3RD AND 4TH GEARS. THE LOCAL SHOP IS NOT TO BLAME, THESE TRANSMISSIONS ARE JUNK. MANY HAVE FLAWS IN THEM AND GM KNOWS IT. SO WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO? UNLESS I RECEIVE A RECALL NOTICE ON THE TRANSMISSION, THE TRAILBLAZER WILL KEEP ITS PLACE IN THE BACKYARD. UNTIL THE JUNK MAN COMES AROUND.  *TR",
