        "summary": "THE IGNITION  LOCK ON MY SATURN VUE HAS BEEN GIVING ME PROBLEMS OVER MULTIPLE OCCASIONS SINCE MAY OF THIS YEAR. IT LOCKS AND AT TIMES DOESN'T ALLOW THE KEY TO TURN THE CAR ON AND SOMETIMES ONCE ON, IT DOESN'T ALLOW IT TO SHUT OFF. I HAVE TAKEN IT INTO A CERTIFIED DEALER FOR REPAIR AND IT TOOK 3 TECH'S TO FIND THAT THE ONLY ISSUE THEY COULD FIND WAS A WIRING ISSUE UNDER THE CAR BUT STILL NOTHING WITH THE IGNITION LOCK AS IT WORKS ON AND OFF. I HAVE REPORTED THIS WITH SATURN ONCE ALREADY AND THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING TO REMEDY THE SITUATION. I HAVE BEEN STUCK AT RANDOM STORES AND LATE FOR WORK AND EVEN HAD TO RENT A VEHICLE TO TAKE OUR SON TO SEE THE SPECIALIST IN ANOTHER STATE. WE TOOK IT FOR A OIL CHANGE TODAY AND NEW BATTERY AND ONCE AGAIN THE TECH HAD A DIFFICULT TIME WITH TURNING THE KEY. HOWEVER SEEING AS IT WAS AT A WALMART OIL & LUBE EXPRESS, THEY WERE NOT EQUIPPED TO HANDLE THAT TYPE OF REPAIR. TODAY'S MILEAGE IS 132200. I AM HIGHLY RECOMMENDING AGAINST ANYONE I KNOW OF BUYING SATURNS AT THIS POINT. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS FAR LESS THAN DESIRABLE AND I WISH I HAD NEVER MADE THE PURCHASE MYSELF.   *TR",
