        "summary": "MY 2006 JETTA TDI HAS 69K MILES ON IT. I BRING IT TO THE DEALER FOR SERVICE ROUTINELY AND BABY THE CAR. IT SPENDS NEARLY NO TIME IN TRAFFIC AND HAS RUN WELL UNTIL LAST WEEK. LAST WEEK I HEARD A FUNNY SOUND COMING FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. I BROUGHT IT INTO THE DEALER. LONG STORY SHORT, THE FLYWHEEL HAD CRACKED AND IT WILL BE OVER $2K FOR THE FLYWHEEL. VW KNOWS ABOUT THIS BEING A FAULTY PART AND I'VE HEARD THEY'VE HAD A FULL RECALL IN OTHER COUNTRIES. I CALLED VW OF AMERICA AND THEY REFUSE TO PAY FOR IT BECAUSE THE CAR IS SLIGHTLY OUT OF WARRANTY.  IT IS BEING REPAIRED IN THE SHOP BECAUSE I CANNOT AFFORD TO BE WITHOUT A CAR. LUCKILY NO ONE WAS HURT, BECAUSE IF I HADN'T BROUGHT THE CAR IMMEDIATELY IN IT COULD HAVE STALLED THE CAR AT HIGH SPEEDS (FREEWAY) AND RUINED THE ENTIRE DRIVETRAIN, CAUSING AN ACCIDENT. AGAIN, VW KNEW THIS PART HAS BEEN FAULTY. THERE IS A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN ON IT. *TR",
