        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING AND IN MOTION, THE CAR SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY SHUTS OFF. IT HAPPENS AFTER SHIFTING OUT OF GEAR WHEN COMING TO A STOP. FOR EXAMPLE, I\u0019LL BE IN 3RD GEAR (OR ANY GEAR FOR THAT MATTER) AND I HAVE TO STOP AND THEREFORE I SHIFT OUT OF GEAR AND THE VEHICLE SHUTS OFF. DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT SHUTS OFF UNEXPECTEDLY, I FEEL THAT THIS PROBLEM IS VERY DANGEROUS. ONE TIME, THE VEHICLE TURNED OFF WHILE MAKING A LEFT TURN ALMOST CAUSING AN ACCIDENT DUE TO THE CAR TURNING OFF. THIS PROBLEM HAS HAPPENED APPROXIMATELY 4-6 TIMES. IT STARTED EARLY IN 2002 AND THE PROBLEM CONTINUES. IN 2003 THE PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED ABOUT 4 TIMES. I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO THE MAROONE HONDA DEALER (BECAUSE I HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY WITH THEM) TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT, THE TECHNICIANS SAY THEY CAN\u0019T FIGURE IT OUT AND THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS CAUSING THE PROBLEM. PLEASE ADVISE IF ANY OTHER OWNERS HAVE REPORTED SIMILAR PROBLEMS AND/OR IF A REMEDY IS KNOWN. YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER IS GREATLY APPRECIATED. THANK YOU.",
