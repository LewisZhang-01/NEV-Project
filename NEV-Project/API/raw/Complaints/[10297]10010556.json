GMC HAD ADDED A 25,000 MILE EXTRA COVERAGE ON THIS PART ABOVE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.  I FEEL THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THIS PART.  I HAVE CONTACTED CUSTOMER SERVICE--NO HELP.  I HAVE CONTACTED THE EXEC OFFICES OF GMC--NO HELP.  I CONTACTED THE BBB OF AUTOS WHO HAD HUMAN RESOURCES OF GMC CALL ME--NO HELP.  I AM HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING THAT NO ONE SEEMS TO THINK THAT 4 REPLACEMENTS ON A FUEL INJECTOR IS EXCESSIVE.  AM I SPINNING MY WHEELS?--PARDON THE PUN!   I HAVE DATA TO SUPPORT THESE CLAIMS OF SERVICE.  THEY WERE ALL DONE BY GM DEALERS AND GMC HAS A RECORD OF REPAIRS.  REFERENCE # 1-74841039.    I FELT THAT GM SHOULD REPLACE THE PART FOR FREE-- EVEN IF I HAVE TO PAY LABOR.  IS THERE A WAY TO FIND OUT THE HISTORY OF THIS PART AND IF IT HAS HAD AS MUCH TROUBLE FOR OTHER OWNERS OF DIESEL FUEL INJECTORS.   *NLM",
