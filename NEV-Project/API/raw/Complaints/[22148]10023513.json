THE FUEL LINE IS ROUTED BEHIND THE STARTER AND IT RUPTURED DO TO RUBBING ON THE CLAMP THAT IS SUPPOSED TO STOP IT FROM VIBRATION. IT COVERED EVERYTHING IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT WITH FUEL ALONG WITH THE STARTER. IF I HAD USED THE STARTER I AM SURE THE RESULTING FIRE WOULD HAVE DONE A HUGE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE. THIS IS A VERY STANDARD PRACTICE OF KENWORTH TO ROUTE THE FUEL LINES THIS WAY. I HAVE TALKED TO MANY MECHANIC'S THAT SAY THIS HAPPENS VERY FREQUENTLY.   *NLM",
