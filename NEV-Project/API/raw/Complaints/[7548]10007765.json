I LATER FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A ABS RECALL FOR THIS IDENTICAL PROBLEM, BUT I WAS NEVER INFORMED OF THE RECALL.  AFTER 4 WEEKS, I HAVE BEEN TOLD THE NISSAN WILL COVER THE REPAIR OF THE VEHICLE, BUT THAT IS ALL.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE I CAN OR SHOULD PURSUE FOR NEGLIGENCE ON BEHALF OF THE CORPORATION AND THE DEALER.  I WAS EXTREMELY FORTUNATE THAT MYSELF AND MY 2 YEAR OLD WERE NOT SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED IN THIS ACCIDENT, AND FEEL SOMEONE SHOULD BE HELD ACOUNTABLE.",
