AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM THAT ALL IMPALAS MAKE THIS NOISE AFTER SO MANY MILES.  THEY SAID THEY WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE STEERING SHAFT. THIS CAR HAS 50,000 MILES AND THEY TELL ME THEY STEERING SHAFT NEED TO BE REPLACED. THIS TELLS ME THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEIR PARTS AND THEY KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM AND THEY DO NOT WANT TO FIX IT. NOW STEERING SHAFTS SEEM TO ME TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE CAR AND THAT IF IT FAILS SOMEONE IS GOING TO GE HURT. SO DOES THIS MAKE IT A SAFETY PROBLEM?  *NM",
