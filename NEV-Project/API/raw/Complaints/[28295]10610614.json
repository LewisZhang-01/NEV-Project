        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 2008 E63 MERCEDES BENZ IN DECEMBER 2013. SINCE THE DATE OF PURCHASE I HAVE NOTICED A STRONG ODOR AND SMELL OF GASOLINE UPON FUELING THE AUTOMOBILE(BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE). THIS ODOR PROGRESSIVELY GOT STRONGER UNTIL I WAS UNABLE TO CLOSE MY GARAGE DUE TO THE FUMES AND THE FEAR FOR MY SAFETY. I TOOK THE CAR TO A MERCEDES BENZ DEALER (LUCKILY) TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT PRIOR TO A ROAD TRIP ON 7/2/2014 AND IT WAS DETERMINED THERE WAS A LEAK IN THE FUEL TANK AND SENDING UNIT (S). THE TECHNICIANS AT THE MERCEDES BENZ DEALERSHIP INDICATED TO ME THAT THE VEHICLE WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND OPERATE. I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IS COMMON TO MY PARTICULAR VEHICLE MAKE, MODEL AND YEAR (A RECALL OR CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT HAS BEEN DONE AGAINST MB FOR THIS PROBLEM). I HAD THE REPAIRS DONE AT MERCEDES BENZ BUT WAS CHARGED FOR THE REPAIRS. I  SEEK TO RECOVER THE REPAIR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENCE. PLEASE CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY AS I NEED GUIDANCE AND INFORMATION REGARDING THIS SITUATION.  *TR",
