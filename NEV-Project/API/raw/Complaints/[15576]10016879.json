        "summary": "WITHIN THE FIRST 5-1/2 MONTHS OF OWNING MY NEW VOLVO STATION WAGON, I HAD TO REPLACE 2 PIRELLI TIRES DUE TO SIDEWALL BUBBLING.  5 MONTHS LATER, WITH 12,000 MILES ON THE CAR, ONE OF THOSE BRAND NEW TIRES HAS TO BE REPLACED AGAIN DUE TO THE SAME ISSUE.      MY MAIN COMPLAINT IS THAT VOLVO RECOMMENDED THESE TIRES TO ME DESPITE THE FACT THAT I INDICATED THAT I LIVE IN REDDING, CT, PRIMARILY DRIVE ON BACK ROADS, AND THAT MY MAIN REASON FOR BUYING THE CAR WAS SAFETY.  THEY TOLD ME I WAS BETTER OFF WITH \"HIGH PERFORMANCE TIRES\".  I'VE CONTACTED VOLVO AND THEY REFUSED TO ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR DO ANYTHING TO HELP.  THEY TOLD ME THAT I MUST HAVE HIT A POTHOLE SO THE DAMAGE WAS MY FAULT BUT IN 18 YEARS OF DRIVING ON THE SAME ROADS THAT I'VE BEEN DRIVING MY VOLVO ON, I HAVE NEVER HAD TO REPLACE TIRES FOR ANY OTHER REASON THAN NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR.  AND SINCE THE PROBLEMS WITH ALL 3 TIRES OCCURRED AT SEPARATE TIMES, IT SEEMS APPARENT THAT THESE TIRES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THE LOCAL DRIVING CONDITIONS.    LUCKILY, THIS HAS NOT YET RESULTED IN AN ACCIDENT, BUT DUE TO THE FACT THAT I SPEND A LOT OF MY DRIVING TIME SHUTTLING MY SMALL CHILDREN AROUND, I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE THE CAR FOR FEAR THAT THE TIRES WILL BLOW OUT. I'D APPRECIATE ANY HELP YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SINCE I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY.",
