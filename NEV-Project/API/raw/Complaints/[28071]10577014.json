WE WERE ABLE TO GET A KEY FROM THE FOB AND UNLOCK THE DOORS,AND UNLATCH THE HOOD SO WE COULD OPEN THE HOOD. ALL THE WIRES, ALTERNATOR, FUSE BOX AND BATTERY WERE CHERRY RED. USING SOME CLIPPERS WE WERE ABLE TO CUT THE BATTERY CABLE AND EVERY THING STOPPED WE COOLED THINGS DOWN WITH SOME SNOW.ALL THIS ONLY 3 FT. FROM OUR HOUSE DODGE ESTIMATED ABOUT $1800.00 TO FIX WHAT COULD BE SEEN AND MOST LIKELY MORE WOULD SHOW UP LATER. THIS IS THE THIRD TIME WE HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE ELECTRICAL ON THIS CAR. MY WIFE AND I ARE BOTH DISABLED AND I NEED A VAN TO CARRY MY WHEEL CHAIR WHEN I GO TO THE DOCTOR,ETC.WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO FIX THE CAR AND STILL MAKE PAYMENTS  I HAVE CONTACTED DODGE AND OUR INSURANCE COMPANY, BUT THEY SAY IT IS OUR PROBLEM.
