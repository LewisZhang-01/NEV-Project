        "summary": "I OWN A 2001 XC 70 VOLVO WHICH I JUST BOUGHT WITH 133900 MILES LAST FRIDAY APRIL 26, 2013.  THE DEALER SHOWED ME THE MAINTENANCE RECORDS INCLUDING A 3 MONTH OLD CALIFORNIA SAFETY INSPECTION REPORT.   ON APRIL 27, 2013, I WAS DRIVING ON A DOWNHILL STRETCH WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE CAR ENGINE LOST POWER, KICKED LIKE IT WANTED TO JUMP AHEAD OF ME, ALL INDICATOR LIGHTS FLASHED, AND THE CAR STALLED AND SHUT DOWN RENDERING THE BRAKE AND STEERING SYSTEM INOPERABLE. I HAD NO MEANS TO CONTROL THE CAR AS IT ROLLED DOWN HILL. I ENGAGED THE REVERSE GEAR CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO STOP.   I CALLED DEALER RIGHT AWAY. HE TOLD ME TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO HIS MECHANIC THE FOLLOWING MONDAY ON 04/29/2013. THE MECHANIC INSPECTED THE VEHICLE AND TEST-DROVE IT AND COULD NOT FIND ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE. HE PERFORMED A DIAGNOSTIC COMPUTER TEST AND GOT AN ERROR MESSAGE INDICATING AN AIR INTAKE PROBLEM.  HE ASKED ME TO BRING THE VEHICLE THE FOLLOWING MORNING SO HE CAN TEST DRIVE IT MORE AND FIND OUT MORE.   WHILE DRIVING HOME, THE PROBLEM RECURRED AGAIN, THIS TIME IN THE MIDDLE OF A FREEWAY. IT WAS DANGEROUS...LUCKILY I WAS IN THE FAR RIGHT LANE, SO IMMEDIATELY I COASTED TO THE SIDE, WITH MY HAZARDS LIGHTS ON AND PULLED TO THE SIDE WHERE THE VEHICLE STOPPED ITSELF. IMAGINE DRIVING 80MPH ON A CALIFORNIA FREEWAY, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE VEHICLE LOSES POWER, THE ENGINES KICK JUMPS, AND WITHOUT YOUR INPUT, ATTEMPTS TO ENGAGE A HIGHER GEAR BUT THEN STALLS AND IMMEDIATELY SHUTS DOWN AND THE BRAKES AND THE STEERING WHEEL JAMS.. THAT IS NOT SAFETY.    AS I AWAIT FOR THE MECHANIC TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, I AM FILING THIS COMPLAINT BECAUSE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. A CAR THAT PASSES A SAFETY INSPECTION TEST SHOULD NOT BE ABRUPTLY SHUTTING DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC AND RENDER THE BRAKE SYSTEM AND STEERING WHEEL INOPERABLE.  *TR",
