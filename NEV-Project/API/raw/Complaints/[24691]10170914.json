        "summary": "THE AUTOMATIC SLIDING DOOR ON MY 2004 SIENNA HAS BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.  AT TIMES, WE CAN'T OPEN THE DOOR FROM THE OUTSIDE AND OTHER TIMES, WE CAN.  ALSO, WE RECENTLY CLOSED THE DOOR WITH THE AUTOMATIC BUTTON AND FOR NO APPARENT REASON, THE CABLE BROKE SO THAT WE NOW HAVE TO OPEN AND CLOSE THE DOOR MANUALLY.  ALSO, WE HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH THE ACCELERATION OF THE VEHICLE IF WE ARE GOING FROM A STOP POSITION OR A SLOW MOVING (LESS THAN 10 KM/H) POSITION.  THE VAN SEEMS TO SLOW DOWN BEFORE SHIFTING INTO GEAR.  THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WHEN DRIVING ESPECIALLY WITH CHILDREN IN THE VEHICLE.  MY WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED AND I'M LOOKING AT HAVING TO PAY FOR THIS ON MY OWN.  I AM DISSATISFIED WITH TOYOTA, I HAVE HAD THIS VEHICLE FOR ONLY 2 YEARS AND I HAVE HAD THREE RECALLS ALREADY.  THIS IS MY 2ND TOYOTA PRODUCT AND MY LAST.  *NM",
