THERE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS JUST LIKE THIS, I HAVE HAD IT LOOKED INTO AS MUCH AS I COULD, BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO HAVE MY MECHANIC PULL THE FUEL TANK TO DIAGNOSE FURTHER.  THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO AND FIXED.  NORMALLY MERCEDES IS EXCELLENT WHEN IT COMES TO SAFETY ISSUES, I'D THINK THEY'D TAKE THIS A BIT MORE SERIOUSLY.  THIS INVESTIGATION IS RELATED TO ACTION NUMBER PE12001.  *TR",
