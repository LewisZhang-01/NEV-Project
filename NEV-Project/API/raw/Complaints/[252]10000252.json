THE PLASTIC COVER IS POOR FITTING, ALLOWING THE SEATBELT PART TO BE INSERTED BETWEEN THE PLASTIC COVER AND THE MECHANISM, THEREBY NOT BEING FASTENED AT ALL, AND SOMETIMES WITHOUT REALIZING IT UNTIL IT COMES APART AS YOU DRIVE.  THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM WHICH REQUIRES VERY CAREFUL INSERTION OF SEAT BELT PART INTO MECHANISM, SOMETIMES IT TAKES SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO SECURE THE SEAT BELT.",
