HOWEVER I HAVE MADE SEVERAL TRIPS TO ACURA PREVIOUS WHEN MY TRANSMISSION WAS HAVING HARD TIME SHIFTING TO REVERSE AND ENGAGE TO REVERSE WITH LOUD METALLIC SOUND AND HARD THUMP.  DEALER TECH WERE HELPFUL AND TRIED TO CALL ACURA TECH LINE TO ASSIST ME IN RESOLVE THE MATTER, BUT THE TECH LINE CONTINUE TO DENY THE PROBLEM AND INSIST IT IS NORMAL FOR A TRANSMISSION TO ENGAGE HARD.  FINALLY WHEN THE TRANNY BLOWN AND I TOOK IT TO DEALER USING 2ND GEAR ON STREET. DEALER SAID THIS (A BLOWN TRANMISSION) IS THE EVIDENCE THEY NEED TO REPLACE IT. EVEN WITH A REFURBISHED ONE NOT A NEW ONE. ALSO I HAVE EXPERIENCED 2 TIMES ON FREEWAY WHERE THE TRANSMISSION DOWNSHIFT ON ITS OWN REDUCING THE VEHICLE SPEED DRAMATICALLY. LUCKILY THERE WERE NO VEHICLE BEHIMD ME",
