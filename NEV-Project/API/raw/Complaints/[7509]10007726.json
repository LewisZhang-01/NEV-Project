        "summary": "SINCE OCT '02, I HAVE HAD MY CAR IN AND OUT OF THE DEALERSHIP DUE TO THE RECALL FOR EMISSIONS. EACH TIME, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT HAS COME ON, I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND HAD THE PROBLEM FIXED. THE FIRST TIME, THE COMPUTER WENT BAD AND WAS REPLACED. THE SECOND TIME, THE O2 SENSOR WENT BAD AND THE CAR STALLED OUT ON A BUSY INTERSTATE IN NC WHERE CONSTRUCTION IS BEING DONE AND THERE ARE NO SHOULDERS TO PULL OFF ON.  I BELIEVE HONDA SHOULD REPLACE THE ENTIRE EMISSIONS SYSTEM COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY INSTEAD OF COSTING THEIR CONSUMERS TIME AND A LOT OF AGGRAVATION BY FIXING THE PROBLEMS ONE AT A TIME. THIS WILL ABSOLUTELY BE THE LAST HONDA I OWN DUE TO THIS ONE SITUATION. I'M SICK OF SPENDING TIME IN THE DEALERSHIP HAVING TO WAIT FOR THEM TO TELL ME WHAT THE CURRENT PROBLEM IS. A CAR THAT IS 6 YEARS OLD SHOULD NOT HAVE TO HAVE THE WHOLE EMISSIONS SYSTEM REPLACED IN THE FIRST PLACE.   THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND SOMEONE NEEDS TO FIX IT.",
