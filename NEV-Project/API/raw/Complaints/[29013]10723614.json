        "summary": "DURING 9/2009, I WAS INFORMED BY OTHER DRIVER'S OF MY HONDA ODYSSEY 2006 OF DIFFICULTY TURNING MY STEERING WHEEL AT LOW SPEEDS. I WONDERED ABOUT IT AND BEGAN TO NOTICE THAT I ALSO HAD DIFFICULTY TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL AT LOW SPEEDS ESPECIALLY WHILE ENTERING OR LEAVING A PARKING SPACE. IN 9/2011, I HAD THE STEERING EXAMINED AND WAS TOLD BY THE HONDA DEALERSHIP THAT THE POWER STEERING PUMP NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND IS INOPERABLE AT LOW SPEEDS. APPARENTLY, AMERICAN HONDA ISSUED A WARRANTY EXTENSION FOR THIS ISSUE OF WHICH I WAS NOT INFORMED. THIS WARRANTY EXTENDED THE TIME FRAME FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE POWER STEERING PUMP TO 100,000 MILES OR 7 YEARS. BY 2011, I HAD 160,602 MILES ON MY VEHICLE AND WAS CLOSER TO THE 100,000 MILE MARK BACK IN 2009. IN 2012, I WAS INFORMED BY ANOTHER CAR REPAIR SHOP OF THE WARRANTY EXTENSION WITH ENCOURAGEMENT TO CALL AMERICAN HONDA. I DID AND WAS TOLD THAT I DIDN'T QUALIFY, BUT COULD FIND DOCUMENT OF THE DIAGNOSIS AND CALL BACK. IN 2015, I FIND MY RECEIPT FROM HONDA DEALERSHIP FROM 9/2011 DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM. I CALL AMERICAN HONDA. THEIR REPRESENTATIVE IS POLITE, LISTENS TO MY STORY, PLACES ME ON HOLD THEN RETURNS TO THE LINE AND TELLS ME THAT THIS WILL STILL NOT BE COVERED. I HAVE BEEN \"NEGLIGENT\" SINCE NOT CONTACTING AMERICAN HONDA BACK AFTER MY FIRST CALL IN 2012 OR HAVING THE CAR REPAIRED FOR THIS ISSUE.  OBVIOUSLY, I WANT AMERICAN HONDA TO ASSIST SINCE THIS IS NOT AN INEXPENSIVE REPAIR. I UNDERSTAND THEIR STANCE AND WISH THEY WERE MORE RESPONSIVE TO LOYAL CUSTOMERS. I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED AN ACCIDENT DUE TO THE POWER STEERING PUMP NOT WORKING CORRECTLY, BUT HAVE WORRIED AT TIMES ESPECIALLY WHEN MAKING TURNS AND BACKING OUT OF SPACES. THROUGH THIS COMPLAINT, I AM HOPING THAT FURTHER INVESTIGATION MIGHT OCCUR WHICH WILL CAUSE THE REPLACEMENT OF THE POWER STEERING PUMP TO BECOME A RECALL VERSUS A WARRANTY EXTENSION.",
