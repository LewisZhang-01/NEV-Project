THERE IS NOW WAY TO SEE OR CHECK THIS FAILURE AND THE REPAIR IS TO REPLACE THE HUB AND BEARING ASSEMBLY. THIS REPAIR IS ANYWHERE BETWEEN 1200.00 TO 1600.00 DEPENDING ON THE DEALER DOING THE JOB. THIS IS A VERY  COMMON PROBLEM FOR THE F250 4X4 SINCE THERE WERE THREE IN THE SHOP AT THE SAME TIME AS MINE. THERE IS ONLY 47000 MILES ON MY TRUCK AND THIS WAS NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY SINCE THE FACTORY ENDED AT 36000 MILES.   *NLM",
