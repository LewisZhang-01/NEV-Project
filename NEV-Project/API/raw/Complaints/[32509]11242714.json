BEST WAY I CAN DESCRIBE THE ISSUES IS AS IF YOUR TIRES WERE OVER INFLATED AND THE SHOCK ABSORBERS WERE MISSING.   VEHICLE HAS 48,000 MILES AND HAS BEEN DOING THIS OCCASIONALLY  FOR APPROXIMATELY THE LAST 20,000 MILES.   THIS IS A 2ND VEHICLE AND GETS DRIVEN MOSTLY ON HIGHWAY.  WHEN GOOGLING WHETHER FORD F-250'S HAVE SHOCK ABSORBER ISSUES, I RAN INTO MANY REPORTS OF THIS WOBBLE ISSUE.",
