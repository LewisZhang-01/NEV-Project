AT 25000 MILES, WE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE BRAKES AGAIN, AND WERE TOLD THEY WERE FINE.  AT 36700 MILES, THE ROTORS ARE NOW WARPED AGAIN, AND I'M TOLD THAT WHILE CHRYLSER KNOWS THAT ITS A DEFECT, THEY WILL NOT COVER IT - AND THEY HAVE EVEN COME OUT WITH A FIX, THAT  COSTS $450, WHICH THEY WON'T COVER.  *JB",
