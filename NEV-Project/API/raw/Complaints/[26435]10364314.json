WHEN I ARRIVED THE SERVICE ADVISOR TOLD ME HE HAD BAD NEWS, MY FUEL PUMP HAD FAILED. THEY GAVE ME A LOANER CAR AND ASKED ME TO BRING IN MY LAST 4-5 FUEL RECEIPTS. I TOLD THEM I DON'T KEEP FUEL RECEIPTS. THEY SAID VW MAY NOT WARRANTY THE FAILURE OF THE FUEL PUMP WITHOUT THE FUEL RECEIPTS. I WAS TOLD ON 11/6/2010 THAT THEY HAD APPROVED THE WARRANTY REPAIR. MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS MAY HAPPEN AGAIN (THE FAILURE OF THE FUEL PUMP) AND COULD PUT ME IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THE REPAIR IS A NEW AND UPGRADED PART AND NOT THE SAME FAILING PART. *TR",
