HE HIT SEVERAL TREES AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY HAS CONSIDERED THE TRUCK \"NEFTR\".  WE CONTACTED DODGE CONCERNING THIS, THEY TOLD US THEY WOULD SEND A REPRESENTATIVE TO INSPECT THE TRUCK AND TELL US WHY THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.  HIS SEAT BELT ALSO DID NOT WORK PROPERLY.  WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH DODGE AGAIN AND THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF SENDING ANYONE TO LOOK AT OUR TRUCK.  WE ARE WONDERING IF THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER SUCH INCIDENTS CONCERNING AIRBAGS IN DODGES LARGER TRUCKS.  WE ALSO WOULD LIKE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE LEVEL OF UNCONCERN OF THE PEOPLE WORKING AT DODGE.   *JB",
