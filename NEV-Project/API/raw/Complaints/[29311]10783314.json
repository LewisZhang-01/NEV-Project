WE LEFT THE LUBE SHOP AND WAS DRIVING DOWN 1431 IN MARBLE FALLS WHEN A GENTLEMAN STOPPED US AND TOLD US THE TAHOE WAS ON FIRE. WE POPPED THE HOOD AND INDEED THERE WERE FLAMES IN THE LOWER PART OF THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. WE CALLED THE POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THEY CAME TO OUR CALL WITHIN 10 MINUTES. IN RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM I SAW THAT THERE IS A RECALL ON THE TUBES BUT MY ISSUE IS THAT WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED OF THE RECALL AND THE WAY THE RECALL IS WRITTEN DOES NOT CONSIDER FIRE FROM THE TRANSMISSION FLUID. THIS HAPPENED ON 10/13/2015.",
