FORD BOUGHT BACK MY FIRST ONE BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T FIX ONGOING ENGINE PROBLEMS THAT STARTED OFF AS A ROUGH IDLE PROBLEM.  THEY EVEN REPLACED THE ENGINE, AND SURPRISINGLY THAT MADE THINGS WORSE.  I HAVE HAD MY NEW VEHICLE SINCE THE END OF JULY AND HAVE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR ROUGH IDLE PROBLEMS RECENTLY.*JB",
