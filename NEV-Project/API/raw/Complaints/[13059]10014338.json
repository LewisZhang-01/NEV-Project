ON OUR FIRST TRIP OUT OF TOWN, ONE OF THE SIDEWALLS OF THE TIRES SIMPLY DISINTEGRATED...NO ROAD HAZARD, NOTHING...THE TIRE JUST FELL APART.  FORTUNATELY, IT WAS A REAR TIRE AND THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT.  NOW, I AM AFRAID OF THAT THESE TIRES ARE TOTALLY UNSAFE, AND WISH THE MANUFACTURER WOULD REFUND OUR MONEY, SO WE COULD GET A BETTER BRAND.  WE BOUGHT THEM AT OK TIRE, FARGO, ND.  *NLM",
