I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER BECAUSE I NOTICED THAT MY CAR WAS PULLING TO THE RIGHT. AFTER AN ALIGNMENT, THE CAR IS PULLING TO THE LEFT.  NOW THE DEALER IS TELLING ME THAT ITS MY TIRES, THAT I NEED TO REPLACE THE 2 FRONT TIRES BECAUSE OF WEAR.   THIS SEEMS OUT OF LINE TO ME BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER HAD TIRES WEAR TO THE POINT THAT THEY NEED TO BE REPLACE TO PUT MY CAR IN ALIGNMENT.  I BELIEVE THESE TIRES SHOULD WEAR (THEY GET NORMAL HIGHWAY AND NEIGHBORHOOD USE) FOR AT LEAST 45K-50K BEFORE NEEDING TO BE REPLACED.      WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE?*AK",
