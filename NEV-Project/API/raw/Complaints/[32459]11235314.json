I HAVE HAD CAR TO 2 DIFFERENT DEALERS AND BOTH SAY IT'S NORMAL-TRUST ME IT'S   NOT AT ALL SATISFACTORY. IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE I WILL HAVE AN ACCIDENT GOING INTO GARAGE. GOING UP SLIGHT INCLINE INTO GARAGE CAUSES CAR TO DOWNSHIFT AND ACCELERATE AND WITH LONG BRAKE TRAVEL RECEIPT FOR DISASTER. SAT IN 2019 MACAN TODAY AND BRAKE TRAVEL IS WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT VERY LITTLE TRAVEL.  IN CONCLUSION PORSCHE  KNEW THEY HAD A PROBLEM IN 2017 AS IT IS NOW FIXED.",
