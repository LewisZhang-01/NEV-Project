HAD I BEEN ON A HIGHWAY THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLY CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES AND I FEAR FOR THOSE DRIVERS WHO MAY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS IN THE FUTURE. CHRYSLER MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS BEYOND THE STATES THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY EXTENDED WARRANTIES TO ON VEHICLES WHO HAVE HAD THESE SAME ISSUES.  MY VEHICLE WAS SHIPPED TO NEVADA - ALSO A WARM WEATHER STATE, YET NOT PART OF THE EXTENDED WARRANTY? THIS MAKES ZERO SENSE.  FIX THE ISSUE CHRYSLER - SHAMEFUL BEHAVIOR, TRULY.  I AM CURRENTLY HAVING ESTIMATES DONE TO SEE WHAT THE REPAIRS WILL COST AND HEARING THAT THIS WILL BE IN THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR SOMETHING THAT IS A FAULTY BUILD.  THERE ARE LITERALLY DOZENS OF FORUMS WITH CHRYSLER DRIVERS TALKING ABOUT THIS VERY SAME, VERY SCARY ISSUE. COME ON CHRYSLER, BE ACCOUNTABLE.",
