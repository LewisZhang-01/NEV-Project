        "summary": "NEW 2007 TOYOTA PRIUS TOURING PACKAGE #6 - 11K MILES AT THIS TIME. CAR ALWAYS LEANS TO THE LEFT. STEERING TUGS TO THE LEFT, BUT DEALER SAYS ALIGNMENT IS FINE. DEALER SAID LEFT SIDE IS 1/2\" LOWER TO GROUND THAN RIGHT SIDE OF CAR. DEALER SAID THAT IS NORMAL AND ACCEPTABLE. I COMPLAINED THAT WHEN I TURN RIGHT, CAR SEEMS TO ROLL EXCESSIVELY AND FEELS UNSTABLE. WHEN I TURN LEFT, CAR & SUSPENSION FEEL FINE - MINIMAL LEAN OR BODY ROLL. PURCHASED CAR NEW IN JAN. 2007. HAD FRONT END ALIGNMENT WITHIN A MONTH OR TWO, WHICH IMPROVED PULLING TO THE LEFT. HOWEVER, HANDLING STILL FELT AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, SO I HAD DEALER CHECK ALIGNMENT AGAIN. DEALER SAID IT WAS WITHIN SPECS. DEALER ALSO ADVISED ME AT THAT TIME THAT THE LEFT SIDE OF CAR WAS 1/2\" LOWER THAN RIGHT SIDE. I'VE MADE SEVERAL RETURN VISITS TO TWO DIFFERENT DEALERS [POWAY TOYOTA AND BOB BRIDGE TOYOTA IN RENTON, WA]; BOTH DEALERS SAY ALIGNMENT IS OK. *TR",
