        "summary": "THE FAILURE OF THE CENTER PULLEY RESULTED IN THE ENGINE BELT COMING LOOSE. IT RESULTED IN ALL POWER MECHANISMS (POWER STEERING, POWER BRAKES FAILING). THE STEERING WAS VERY HARD TO TURN. THE BELT GOT RIPPED BY THE FAN WHILE IT WAS WORKING. THE FAN ALSO STOPPED WORKING AND ELEVATED THE ENGINE TEMPERATURE. NO VISIBLE INDICATION OF THIS ON THE DASH PANEL. WHEN I OPENED THE HOOD, THE METAL PULLEY WAS SITTING LOOSE AGAINST THE ENGINE BLOCK. IF THE PULLEY HAD FALLEN DOWN OR HIT THE FUEL LINE, IT COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. MERCEDES DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THEY HAVE SEEN THIS PROBLEM BEFORE AND IT HAPPENS IN HOT WEATHER. MERCEDES HAS FIXED THIS PROBLEM IN LATER MODELS BUT NOT LETTING OWNERS OF PREVIOUS MODELS KNOW ABOUT THIS POTENTIALLY SERIOUS PROBLEM.
