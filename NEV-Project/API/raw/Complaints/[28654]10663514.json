        "summary": "ON DECEMBER 10TH, I WENT TO PULL OFF AND WHILE I WAS IN DRIVE,  A WARNING CAME UP THAT SAID \"STEERING ASSIST FAILURE.\" AND MY STEERING LOCKED ON ME.  PRIOR TO THIS,  I HAVE MADE SEVERAL COMPLAINTS TO FORD,  INFORMING THEM THAT OVER THE LAST 6, MY CAR HAS GOTTEN INCREASINGLY LOUDER AND SHAKES TERRIBLY.  THEY'VE IGNORED MY CONCERNS AND DISMISSED ME MULTIPLE TIMES,  STATING THAT IF NOTHING IS FOUND ON THE COMPUTER,  THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING.  IN OCTOBER,  I REFUSED TO LEAVE THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT UNTIL SOMEONE CHECKED MY CONCERNS.  FINALLY,  A MECHANIC SAT IN MY CAR AND LISTENED TO THE LOUD RATTLING NOISE.  HE SAID \"THAT'S NOT NORMAL.\" UPON INSPECTION,  THE MECHANIC SAID THAT HE FOUND 2 LOOSE CLIPS THAT ATTACH TO MY FUEL LINE.  I WAS TOLD THAT MY ENTIRE FUEL LINE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED,  BUT THAT THE PART WAS ON BACK ORDER.  THEY SAID I NEEDED TO STILL DRIVE MY CAR DESPITE THE \"LOOSE CLIPS. \" I DON'T KNOW HOW ACCURATE THEIR DIAGNOSIS IS,  BUT THEY SAID MY PART WOULD FINALLY BE HERE ON NOVEMBER 17, 2014. WHEN I CALLED AGAIN YESTERDAY, THEY SAID IT WAS STILL ON BACK ORDER! FROM WHAT I'M READING ABOUT THIS STEERING WHEEL LOCK PROBLEM,  IT SOUNDS LIKE MY PRIOR CONCERNS CAN ALL BE RELATED.  FORD SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE A RECALL FOR MY STEERING WHEEL PROBLEM AND ASKED ME TO DRIVE MY CAR THERE! I INFORMED THEM THAT MY STEERING WHEEL LOCKED ON ME AND THAT I DID NOT FEEL SAFE! I'M FURIOUS AT THE WAY I HAVE BEEN TREATED AS A CUSTOMER AND I FEEL LIKE NO ONE CARES ABOUT MY SAFETY.    *TR",
