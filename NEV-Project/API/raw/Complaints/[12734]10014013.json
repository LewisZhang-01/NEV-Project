THEY HAVE BEEN REPLACED ABOUT 2,000 MILES AGO AND THE FRONT END IS VIBRATING AGAIN NOW.  THE CAR HAS 45,000 MILES ON IT BOUGHT AND EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR 60,000 MILES.  THE LEFT FRONT TIRE HAS LOCKED UP TWO TIMES WHILE DRIVING, CAUSING THE CAR TO SPIN ACROSS FOUR LANES, THE FIRST TIME AND DOING A 180 WHILE ON AN ON RAMP RIGHT AFTER LEAVING LONG PONTIAC OF CHATTANOOGA.  EVER TIME I TAKE THE CAR TO THEM THEY JUST TELL ME THAT THEY CAN NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND TELL ME IT IS OK.  *JB",
