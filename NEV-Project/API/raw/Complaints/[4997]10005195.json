I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE ALL THE DEFECTIVE COILS REPLACED BUT I HAVE READ NUMEROUS COMPLAINS THAT VOLKSWAGEN WILL NOT REPLACE THESE BECAUSE NOT ENOUGH PARTS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED.  I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO HAVE A CAR THAT IS ONLY ONE YEAR OLD TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY VOLKSWAGEN WOULDN'T DO A VOLUNTARY RECALL ON THESE AS THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE WIDESPREAD.  I AM HAPPY WITH THE SERVICE I RECEIVED (COLONICAL VOLKSWAGEN, WESTOBOROUGH MA) BUT DISAPPOINTED IN THE MANUFACTUER FOR NOT STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE AND NOTIFYING OWNERS BEFORE THEIR CAR LEAVES THEM STRANDED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.",
