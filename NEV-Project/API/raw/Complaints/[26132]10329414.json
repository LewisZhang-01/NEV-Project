        "summary": "I BOUGHT MY 2004 SATURN ION USED WITH LESS THAN 60,000 MILES ON IT, I HAD IT LESS THAN A YEAR WHEN ONE DAY IT WOULDN'T START, I THOUGHT IT WAS THE BATTERY OR THE ALTERNATOR, BUT NONE OF THAT FIXED THE PROBLEM.  THIS PROBLEM PROGRESSIVELY GOT WORSE AND STARTED HAPPENING VERY FREQUENTLY, MORE OFTEN WHEN IT GOT COLD OUT. AFTER ABOUT 10-15 MINUTES THE CAR WILL START, I HAVE HAD TO WAIT UP TO 45 MINUTES FOR THE CAR TO START SOMETIMES.  THIS PROBLEM HAS MADE ME LATE FOR WORK, LEFT MY CHILDREN WAITING FOR ME AND LEFT MYSELF AFTER WORK CLOSING A BAR ONE NIGHT AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING.  THE MORE I MENTIONED THIS PROBLEM TO PEOPLE THE MORE I FOUND OUT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM, IT HAS TO DO WITH THE SECURITY PASS LOCK SYSTEM AND IGNITION.  IF THIS IS SUCH A FREQUENT PROBLEM FOR SATURNS WHY HASN'T THERE BEEN A RECALL EVER TO HAD IT FIXED, AND WHY ARE DEALERSHIPS ALLOWED TO SELL USED SATURNS WITHOUT CORRECTING THE PROBLEM OR MAKING BUYERS AWARE OF THIS POTENTIAL PROBLEM, IT IS SIMPLY DISHONEST! *TR",
