THE IGNITION SWITCH NEEDS REPLACED UNDER RECALL P41 BUT NO PARTS ARE AVAILABLE FROM MANUFACTURER.  CAR IS DANGEROUS AND SHOULDN'T BE DRIVEN.  CHRYSLER HAS BEEN CONTACTED AND SAYS THEY ARE SORRY BUT PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE.  RECALL IS OVER 3 MONTHS AND NO ONE IS DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THE SAFETY ISSUE SO MANY OWNERS ARE FACING.  IT IS DANGEROUS.  NHTSA HAS NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON SAME ISSUE BUT NO ONE IS MAKING CHRYSLER FIX THE PROBLEM.  NO ONE IS GOVERNING THE RECALL.  ACCORDING TO NOLO: CONTACT THE NHTSA. IF YOU ARE STILL UNABLE TO GET RELIEF, CONTACT THE NHTSA. ALTHOUGH YOU CAN SKIP THE FIRST TWO STEPS AND CONTACT NHTSA IMMEDIATELY, IT IS USUALLY BETTER TO CONTACT THE SERVICE MANAGER AND MANUFACTURER FIRST -- SINCE MOST PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED AT THOSE LEVELS. YOU CAN CONTACT THE NHTSA BY TELEPHONE AT 888-327-4236 OR BY MAIL AT 1200 NEW JERSEY AVENUE, SE, WEST BUILDING, WASHINGTON, D.C. 20590. OR FILL OUT A FORM AT THE NHTSA'S INTERACTIVE WEBSITE AT WWW-ODI.NHTSA.DOT.GOV.  YET, NOTHING IS BEING DONE.  THERE IS NO REMEDY AND NO ONE IS MAKING CHRYSLER GIVE ANOTHER SOLUTION.  EXACTLY HOW LONG DOES THE MANUFACTURER HAVE TO COMPLY?  I THINK OVER 3 MONTHS IS PLENTY OF TIME.  *TR",
