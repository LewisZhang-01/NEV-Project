THEN IT STALLED AT THE STREET. RESTARTED THE CAR AND EVERYTHING SEEMED NORMAL UNTIL I PUT IT IN GEAR. AFTER ONLY A FEW FEET IT STALLED AGAIN. IT NOW STALLS IN ANY GEAR BESIDES PARK AND NEUTRAL. HAD TO PUSH THE CAR OFF THE ROAD AND HAVE IT TOWED. ANOTHER BAD CVT TRANSMISSION. NISSAN SHOULD BE ASHAMED. SELLING THESE CARS WITH MAJOR MECHANICAL FAILURE AND POOR WARRANTY. HAD TO EXTENDED WARRANTY ON PREVIOUS MODEL YEARS BECAUSE OF FAILURES. SHOULD BE A RECALL. THIS IS HAPPENING TO TO MANY PEOPLE. LAST NISSAN I WILL OWN.",
