WHEN I WOULD TAKE IT TO A DEALERSHIP THEY WOULD CONTACT FORD AND RELAY A MESSAGE THAT IT WAS WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS. ON 5/13/03 I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO ONE OF THE DEALERSHIPS TELLING THEM THAT I WAS GOING TO PURSUE GOING TO A LEMON LAW ATTORNEY. THAT SAME DAY THEY DISCOVERED THAT THE PISTON RINGS WERE LINED UP AND HAVE LOST COMPRESSION. THE TRUCK IS CURRENTLY IN THE DEALERSHIP HAVING THE WHOLE BLOCK AND HEADS REBUILT.  I AM ASHAMED THAT IT TOOK A THREAT TO FINALLY GET THEM TO FIX THE PROBLEM WITH THE 5.4.      *TT",
