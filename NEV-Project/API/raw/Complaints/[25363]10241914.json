        "summary": "I OWN A 2004 CADILLAC DEVILLE.  EVERY TIME I DRIVE THROUGH IN HEAVY RAIN OR THROUGH STANDING WATER IN THE ROAD, THE POWER STEERING MALFUNCTIONS.  I HAVE HAD SEVERAL NEAR-CRASHES BECAUSE I WAS UNABLE TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL QUICKLY.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS, I MUST UNEXPECTEDLY EXERT A LOT OF STRENGTH TO TURN THE WHEEL.  THIS PROBLEM IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY HAZARD.  I CONTACTED MY AUTHORIZED CADILLAC DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THE CAUSE FOR THE PROBLEM IS THE PECULIAR DESIGN OF THIS VEHICLE WHICH DIRECTS WATER FROM THE ROAD TO THE BELT WHICH DRIVES THE FAN, ALTERNATOR AND THE POWER STEERING PUMP.  WHEN THE BELT GETS SOAKED WITH WATER, IT SLIPS ON THE PULLEYS AND CEASES TO TURN THEM, CAUSING THE SYSTEMS CONNECTED TO THE BELT TO FAIL.  THE DEALER WAS NOT ABLE TO CORRECT THIS DESIGN DEFECT.  I REQUEST THAT THIS PARTICULAR MODEL BE RECALLED BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL FAILURE OF THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM.  *TR  UPDATED 05/06/09.*JB",
