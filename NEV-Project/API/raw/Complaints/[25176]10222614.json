ACCORDING TO THE POLICE REPORT HE WAS TRAVELING AT 45 MPH WHEN HE IMPACTED THE REAR OF ANOTHER CAR.    2. AS A RESULT OF THE IMPACT HE WAS THROWN FORWARD AND HIS HEAD STRUCK THE WINDSHIELD.  HE SUFFERED A MILD CONCUSSION AND CUTS AN BRUISES.  THE AUTOMOBILE HAS FACTORY INSTALLED AIR BAGS FOR BOTH THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER.  NEITHER AIR BAG DEPLOYED.    3. STATE FARM (THE INSURER) WROTE THE CAR OFF AS A TOTAL LOSS.  I SENT PHOTOS OF THE CAR TO KIA CORPORATE IN IRVIN, CA.  THEIR COMMENT WAS THAT THE AIRBAGS SHOULD NOT DEPLOY IN AND ACCIDENT OF THIS NATURE.  NO ONE LOOKED AT THE CAR TO DETERMINE WHAT FAILED IN THE SYSTEM.  *TR",
