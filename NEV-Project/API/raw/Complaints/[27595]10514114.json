UPON MY ARRIVAL I NOTICED A SCENT WHICH I BELIEVE WAS COMING FROM MY CAR THEN PROCEEDED TO PULL INTO THE PARKING LOT OF THE GYM, PARK THE CAR, TURN THE ENGINE OFF  AND OPEN THE HOOD OF THE CAR. AFTER DOING SO, I WAS SHOCKED TO DISCOVER THAT MY ENGINE WAS ON FIRE ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER COMPONENTS UNDER THE HOOD SUCH AS MY ELECTRICAL WIRING AND SPARK PLUGS. I HAD A SAFETY RECALL ACT (REPAIR)  PERFORMED ON MY CAR IN FEBRUARY 2013 BY A GM DEALERSHIP, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS COMPLETELY SAFE AND WOULD GIVE MY CAR LONGEVITY ACTUALLY DID THE OPPOSITE. I FILED A CASE WITH GM REGARDING THIS MATTER BUT HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE RUN-A-ROUND AS OF MAY 20,2013. I'M VERY UNHAPPY WITH THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE THUS FAR AND NEED ASSISTANCE IN ADDRESSING THIS DANGEROUS MATTER.  *TR",
