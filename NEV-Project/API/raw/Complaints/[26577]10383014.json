WHEN SHE NOTICED THAT THIS HAD HAPPENED SHE HIT THE BRAKES AND NOTHING HAPPENED. THE BRAKES SEEMED AS THOUGH THEY WERE NOT WORKING. NOT KNOWING WHAT ELSE TO TRY SHE THEN ATTEMPTED TO ENGAGE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE. IT DID NOT ENGAGE, IT KEPT GOING DOWN THEN JUST COMING RIGHT BACK UP. STILL NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO SHE SHIFTED DOWN TO LOW GEARS SLOWING HER DOWN. STILL OUT OF CONTROL SHE HIT A DITCH WHICH SHUT DOWN THE ENGINE FINALLY BRINGING THE CAR TO A STOP. I JUST THOUGHT THAT THIS SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF SOMEONE. SHE LUCKILY WAS NOT INJURED BUT COULD HAVE BEEN THOUGH. *TR",
