I THINK THIS IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY HAZARD BECAUSE IF I CAN'T ROLL UP THE WINDOW, THE CAR CAN BE EASILY STOLEN, VANDALIZED, OR BURGLARIZED.  NOT TO MENTION MY DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW ENTRAPPING ME INSIDE OF THE CAR IN CASE THE VEHICLE SUBMERGE INTO WATER.  I HAVE LOOKED INTO GETTING THE PROBLEM FIXED, & THE QUOTES I GOT WERE 400-500$ FOR EACH WINDOW.  MY WARRANTY HAS BEEN UP FOR A YEAR.  *JB",
