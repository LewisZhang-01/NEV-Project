        "summary": "I PURCHASED MY NEW CAR IN MAY OF 2011, MY FIRST YEAR I HAD NO PROBLEMS. MY SECOND YEAR I HAVE LOST BRAKES TOOK IT TO DEALER AND THEY REPLACED MY BRAKE SWITCH. AND NOW IT IS HAVING SHIFTING ISSUES. IT REVS HIGH WHEN REMOVED FROM PARK TO DRIVE WHEN YOU LEFT OFF THE BREAK IT JERKS HARD THROWING YOU BACK INTO THE SEAT. IT ALSO LOSES POWER. IF IM STOPPED AND TRY TO PULL OUT IT DOES NOT WANT TO GO. IT HESITATES THEN IT WILL TAKE OFF QUICKLY. THE HESITATION IS VERY UN SAFE. I HAVE BEEN ALMOST HIT BY AN ON COMING CAR DUE TO IT. LUCKILY IT TOOK OFF SO NO ACCIDENT THAT TIME. I DO NOT TRUST IT. I RECENTLY LOST POWER GOING UP HILL AROUND A TURN I WAS ACCELERATING BUT LOSING SPEED. I COMPLETELY LEFT OFF THE ACCELERATOR AND REAPPLIED IT WAS A SLOW RESPONSE BUT FINALLY TOOK OFF AND DROVE. IT IS NOT SHIFTING PROPERLY. I HAVE AN AUTOMATIC. IT JUST SEEMS HARD SHIFTING AND JERKY WHEN IT DOES SHIFT. THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE. SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET KILLED FROM THE SLUGGISH DELAY THESE VEHICLES ARE HAVING THEN GM WILL BE SUED. MINE SEEMS TO BE GETTING WORSE YESTERDAY 20 MAY 2013 WAS THE FIRST FOR LOSE OF POWER UP HILL. I HAVE NOT YET HAD MY BACK TO DEALER OVER THIS ISSUE BUT SINCE IT IS GETTING WORSE AND ACTING UP MORE OFTEN I WILL TAKING IT IN AND SEE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT IT.  *TR",
