        "summary": "BROUGHT MY TRUCK INTO THE FORD DEALERSHIP BECAUSE THE DOOR WAS NOT LATCHING CLOSED AT ALL.  THE TRUCK IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY AND HAS LESS THAN 20K MILES.  LATER THAT DAY THE DEALERSHIP CALLED AND TOLD ME THE TRUCK WAS FIXED AND READY TO BE PICKED UP.    LESS THAN 48 HOURS LATER THE LATCH AGAIN WOULD NOT WORK.  I DROVE THE TRUCK BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP WHILE HOLDING THE DOOR CLOSED WITH ONE HAND SO IT WOULDN'T FLY OPEN IN TRAFFIC.  THEY AGAIN SAID IT WOULD BE FIXED AND THEY TOLD ME I WAS GIVING THEM 'ATTITUDE' BECAUSE I WAS UPSET THAT IT DIDN'T GET FIXED THE FIRST TIME.  ONCE I GOT HOME I CALLED ANOTHER DEALERSHIP AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS ACTUALLY A RECALL FOR THIS EXACT ISSUE.  MY BIGGEST GRIPE IS THAT THE FIRST DEALERSHIP NEVER INFORMED ME OF A KNOWN SAFETY ISSUE WITH MY VEHICLE AFTER BRINGING IT IN TWO TIMES WITHIN A THREE DAY PERIOD.  I FOUND IT TO BE ALARMING THAT THEY WOULD SEND ME BACK OUT ON THE ROAD WITHOUT FIXING OR EVEN INFORMING ME ABOUT THIS POTENTIAL HAZARD RECALL.",
