ALSO MY SON WHO HAS JUST TURNED 1 YEAR OLD HAS PULLED OFF THE THIN LINING ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE PADDING THAT GOES AROUND HIS HEAD AND EATS THE STUFFING. I HAVE HAD TO COVER HIS CAR SEAT IN LAYERS OF BLANKETS AND I AM CONSTANTLY DISTRACTED WHILE DRIVING BECAUSE OF  TRYING TO KEEP THE BLANKETS ON HIS SEAT AND KEEP HIM FROM CHOKING ON THE INSIDE PADDING OF HIS CAR SEAT. *JB",
