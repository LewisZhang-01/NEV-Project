HAVE HAD OUR HONDA DEALER INSTALL THE NEW \"C\"  MARKED CONTROL ARMS AND ALIGNMENT DONE ALSO AT 13K.  HONDA REP LOOKED AT CAR TODAY WITH 21K SAID ALL IS OK AND IS TO HONDA SPECS.  THIS  IS NOT MY IDEA OF A CAR THAT IS MADE CORRECTLY OR IN ANYONE'S SPEC'S ANYWHERE IN THE REAL AUTOMOTIVE WORLD ! REALLY 3 SETS OF TIRES IN 21K MILES \"NORMAL\" THAT TAKES  ALOT OF IGNORANCE ON HONDA'S PART. A STRESSFUL WAITING GAME FOR THE TIRE'S TO BLOW OUT, HEAVEN KNOWS YOU WILL NOT HEAR TIRES GO WITH ALL THE NOISE FROM THEM.  JUST HOPE WERE ABLE TO CONTROL CAR AND NO ONE GETS HURT.  *TR",
