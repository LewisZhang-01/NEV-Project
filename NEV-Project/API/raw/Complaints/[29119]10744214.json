        "summary": "IN MAY 2015 MY 2011 FORD F150 3.5L ECOBOOST BEGAN MAKING A BUZZING NOISE IN THE FRONT LEFT FENDER WELL UNDER THE HOOD. FROM THAT TIME FORWARD THE TRUCK MAKES THE NOISE UPON START-UP. ONCE THE VEHICLE RUNS FOR A WHILE THE NOISE SEEMS TO FADE AWAY BUT RETURNS UPON RESTART. A TECHNICIAN TRIED TO DIAGNOSE THE NOISE AT A LOCAL REPAIR SHOP BUT TO NO AVAIL. THE NOISE HAS GOTTEN WORSE WHICH PROMPTED ME TO TAKE THE TRUCK BACK TO THE REPAIR SHOP TO DIAGNOSE AGAIN. THIS TIME I DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE MATTER AND NOTICED THAT THERE WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT THE VACUUM PUMP IN SOME OF THESE MODEL TRUCKS. UPON PICKING UP MY TRUCK THE TECHNICIAN INFORMED ME THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE VACUUM PUMP AND THAT I SHOULD TAKE MY TRUCK TO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THEM DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM AND THAT THE PART IS ONLY AVAILABLE THROUGH FORD AT THIS TIME. I MADE AND APPOINTMENT WITH THE FORD DEALERSHIP WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER ABOUT THE NOISE. HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEM AND SAID THAT 9/10 TIMES THE VACUUM PUMP IS THE PROBLEM. HE EXPLAINED THAT FORD HAD SWITCHED VENDORS FOR THE PART AND REDESIGNED THE PUMP IN NEWER MODELS AND ISSUED A (TSB) REGARDING THE PUMP. SINCE MY TRUCK WAS JUST OUTSIDE THE WARRANTY PERIOD HE SAID I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR, WHICH WAS QUOTED AT MORE THAN $900. THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT THE PART WAS ON BACK ORDER UNTIL MID AUGUST 2015 AND THAT I SHOULD SCHEDULE TO HAVE THE REPAIR COMPLETED THEN. I ASKED IF THERE WAS A SAFETY HAZARD ASSOCIATED WITH CONTINUED DRIVING AND HE SAID, \"NO, THE ONLY THING THAT COULD HAPPEN IS YOU COULD LOSE YOUR BRAKES OR POSSIBLY 4 WHEEL DRIVE, BUT YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE BRAKES ARE HEAVY IF ITS GOING OUT COMPLETELY.\" I FEEL THAT FORD SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE TO REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE PART THAT THEY ACKNOWLEDGE AS A PROBLEM AND HAVE REDESIGNED, AND WHICH CAN CAUSE BRAKE OR 4 WHEEL DRIVE FAILURE PUTTING MYSELF AND MY PASSENGERS AT RISK.",
