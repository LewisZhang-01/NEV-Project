I COULD NOT STEER MY CAR OFF THE DIVIDER, AND THE BRAKES WEREN'T WORKING AS WELL EITHER.  I IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT THE ENGINE STOPPED AND MY CAR POWERED OFF WITHOUT WARNING (THE CAR HAS A HISTORY OF FAILED WARNING LIGHTS OR WARNING LIGHTS GOING ON FOR NO REASON, HAVING THE INSTRUMENT PANEL REPLACED ONCE, BUT NOT SOLVING THE PROBLEM).  MY CAR ENDED UP SPINNING OUT ACROSS THE ROAD AND SLAMMING INTO A TREE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  IF THE TIMING WAS DIFFERENT BY A SPLIT-SECOND, I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY HIT THE TREE WITH THE DRIVER'S SIDE, OR SLAMMED HEAD-ON INTO A LIGHT POLE.  MY CAR WAS TOTALED AND I SPLIT MY HEAD OPEN AND HAD TO GET STITCHES.  I AM VERY LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.  I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH THIS CAR, AND ANOTHER ONE OF IT'S STUPID FAILURES ALMOST KILLED ME.  *JB",
