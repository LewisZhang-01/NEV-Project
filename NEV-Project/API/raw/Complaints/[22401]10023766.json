THERE IS A RECALL (# 03V159000) ON THE 1997 WIPER MOTORS......BUT NOT ON THE 1998 EVEN THOUGH THE DESIGN AND WIPER MOTOR ARE THE SAME. DURING A RECENT RAINSTORM THE WIPER MOTOR BECOME COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEED. THE MOTOR MAKES THE SAME \"BUZZING\" SOUND THAT GM TECHNICIANS REFER TO FOR OTHER GM VEHICLE YEARS. CLEARLY, THIS IS THE SAME ISSUE. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE RECALL RE-EVALUATED OR AT A MINIMUM INCLUDE THE 1998 MODELS.   *NLM",
