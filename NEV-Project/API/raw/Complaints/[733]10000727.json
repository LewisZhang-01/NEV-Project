A FEW YEARS LATER THE PAINT CRACKED AND BEGAN TO PEEL OFF ESPECIALLY AFTER A HARD RAIN.I TOOK THE CAR TO D&M CHRYSLER WHERE I BOUGHT IT AND THE SERVICE DEPT SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.  I THEN TOOK PICTURES OF THE CAR AND SENT A COMPLAINT TO CHRYSLER CORP. THEY CALLED ME AND SAID THEY SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE DEPT AT D&M AND WERE TOLD THAT THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY BRUSHING SNOW OFF OF THE CAR. THEY REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING.  THE CAR IS ALL RUSTED NOW AND TODAY I NOTICED THAT THE REAR WINDOW IS SEPERATED FROM THE ROOF AT THE TOP BECAUSE THE RUBBER WON'T STICK TO THE RUSTED ROOF. THERE IS ABOUT A 1/4\" GAP. I FEEL THIS HAS NOW BECOME A SAFETY ISSUE AS THE REAR WINDOW WILL MOST SURELY POP OUT IF I AM IN AN ACCIDENT. I UNDERSTAND FROM VARIOUS WEBSITES THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO OTHERS, RESULTING IN PASSENGERS BEING THROWN FROM THE CAR WHEN THE REAR WINDOW GAVE WAY.",
