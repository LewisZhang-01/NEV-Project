THE \"STONE MONTAIN GEORGIA\" DEALERSHIP CANNOT LOCATE THE PROBLEM BUT IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A DEAD SHORT IN THE SYSTEM.  THIS PROBLEM HAS CREATED A FIRE IN THE UPPER CENTER REAR BRAKE WARNING LIGHT AND HAS MELTED THE HOUSING THAT IN-CASES THE BULB.    THE BRAKE AND TAIL LIGHTS ARE CONSTANTLY BURNING OUT.  I HAVE CEASED USE OF THE REMOTE DOOR LOCK AS THE FLASHING OF THE LIGHTS SEAMED TO ONLY MAKE THE PROBLEM WORSE AND BLOW LIGHT BULBS MORE OFTEN.    NOT ONLY IS THE PROBLEM A FINACIAL ISSUE WITH ME BUT IT IS ALSO A SAFTY FACTOR ENVOLVED AND I THINK TOYOTA SHOULD TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM   ON THERE DIME!",
