ON 5/16/2018 I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD DURING RUSH HOUR IN THE LEFT LANE OF TRAFFIC WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE I GET A NOTIFICATION THAT SAYS \"ENGINE FAULT SERVICE NOW\". THEN THE ENGINE CUTS OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY ROAD. THE PERSON BEHIND ME ALMOST SMASHED INTO ME BUT SWERVED AT THE LAST SECOND AND CUT A CAR OFF IN THE LANE NEXT TO ME. I TRIED TO TURN THE CAR OFF AND THEN ON, BUT IT WOULDN'T START. IT WAS SOOO DANGEROUS TO BE STUCK ON THE ROAD NOT ABLE TO DO ANYTHING. I HAD TO CALL THE POLICE TO SET UP FLARES BEHIND ME. I HAVE BEEN READING BLOGS AND I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON THIS HAS HAPPENED TO.",
