SHIFTING TO NEUTRAL, TURNING OFF THE IGNITION AND THEN TURNING THE KEY TO START DID CAUSE A RE-START. THIS PROBLEM CAUSES THE \"SERVICE ENGINE SOON\" LIGHT ON THE DASH TO LIGHT, SO A CODE IS BEING GENERATED. FORD IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM, SINCE IT HAS ISSUED A NOTICE (NOT A RECALL) TO IT'S SERVICE DEPARTMENTS. THE REPAIR IS THE REPLACEMENT OF THE ALTERNATOR WIRING HARNESS ASSEMBLY AND REPROGRAMMING OF THE PROCESSOR. FORD HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL FOR THIS VERY UNSAFE PROBLEM, SO THE CHARGE FOR THE WORK IS $ 342.64.  *TR",
