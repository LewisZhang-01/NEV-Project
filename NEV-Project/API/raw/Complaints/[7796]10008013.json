HAD DEALERSHIP INSPECT AND THEY FOUND NO PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKES OR WITH THE MASTER BRAKE CYLINDER AND GAVE THE BRAKING SYSTEM A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH.  THE BRAKES HAVE FAILED ONCE MORE SINCE TAKING CAR TO DEALERSHIP (THIS IS ALL WITHIN A THREE WEEK PERIOD).  FORTUNALTY NO ACCIENT HAS OCCURED.  PER SERVICE DEPARTEMENT THE ONLY REMEDY IS TO LEAVE CAR AT DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THEM DRIVE ON A REGULAR BASIS TO SEE IF BRAKES FAIL AGAIN.",
