GOING ON A LOT OF FORUMS, I'VE BEEN GETTING MANY PEOPLE SAYING THIS HAPPENS TO THEIR VEHICLE. I WENT DOWN TO ASK ABOUT A PRICE FOR THE PART AND JOB AND I WAS TOLD 900 OR SO. I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS FARE TO MYSELF AND MANY OTHER INFINITI DRIVERS TO HAVE TO SPEND THAT MUCH ON AN ALREADY GREAT LUXURY VEHICLE. I BEEN STUCK 2 TIMES ON THE HIGHWAY AND ONE TIME WITH MY DAUGHTER. THIS WAS MY GIFT AFTER A ROUGH DEPLOYMENT AND I BELIEVE IF I SHOULD GET CHARGED IT SHOULD ONLY BE THE LABOR WORK FOR AN HOUR OR SO.  *TR",
