        "summary": "THE BLIND SIDE MONITOR, BSM, ON THE PASSENGER SIDE DOES NOT WORK! IT DOES NOT CONSISTENTLY DETECT LARGE SEMI-TRUCKS, LARGE PICKUP TRUCKS, SOME SUV VEHICLES AND RANDOM CARS. THE BSM ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE VEHICLE WORKS VERY WELL. I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP THAT THIS IS HAPPENING TO 2018 COROLLA'S AND ALSO THE HIGHLANDER.  THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS SINCE THE SYSTEM DOES NOT SHOW A LARGE VEHICLE IN YOUR BLINDSPOT AS ADVERTISED AND COULD LEAD TO A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.      I PRESENTED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF TOYOTA VIDEO FILES SUBSTANTIATING BY CONCERNS AND THE IMMEDIATELY CALLED FOR A TOYOTA CORPORATION FTS WHO REQUESTED MY VEHICLE FOR THEIR REVIEW.  THE SERVICE MANAGER STATED THAT THEY DID INDEED REPLICATE THE FAILURE MODE WITH THE TOYOTA CORPORATION REPRESENTATIVE BUT THE TOYOTA REPRESENTATIVE SAID THE SYSTEM IS WORKING AS DESIGNED!  SO TOYOTA HAS A BSM THAT WILL NOT SENSE A SEMI-TRUCK IN YOUR BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE BUT WILL ON THE DRIVE SIDE. I PERCEIVE THAT TO BE A PROTECT TOYOTA LIABILITY RESPONSE NOT A SAFETY ISSUE FOCUS.      I HAVE SEVERAL VIDEO FILES DOCUMENTING THE BSM NOT WORKING WHICH I WOULD BE WILLING TO SHARE.  THE FILES ARE MOV FORMAT AND NOT A FORMAT LISTED AS UPLOAD ABLE IN YOUR SYSTEM.      THE BSM MONITOR HAS NOT WORKED APPROPRIATELY SINCE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE MARCH 8, 2018.  THE DENIAL BY THE TOYOTA FTS WAS WEDNESDAY, JULY, 18, 2018.",
