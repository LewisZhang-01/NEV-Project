IT WOULD MAKE A SOUND OF HESITATION BEFORE STARTING FOR 3-5 SECONDS. WE HAD THE BATTERY REPLACED THIS PAST WINTER. WE TOOK THE CAR TO OUR LOCAL HONDA DEALER FOR A CHECK ON THE ELECTRICAL AND STARTING SYSTEMS. THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG. WE MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE CAR TO NOT START IN ORDER FOR HONDA TO FIND OUT WHAT IS WRONG.",
