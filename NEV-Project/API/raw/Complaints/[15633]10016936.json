PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE TO TAKE MY HUSBAND TO NASHVILLE, FOR HIS HEART TRANSPLANT VISITS, NEEDED A RELIABLE VEHICLE.  ON THE LAST TRIP THERE, 70 MPH, IN HARD RAIN, NO WINDSHIELD WIPERS, JUST QUIT ON THE EXPRESSWAY, IN HEAVY TRAFFIC.  GAS PEDAL ALSO STICKS, AND PUSHES WITH FORCE, WHEN IT RELEASES.  (WONDER WE HAVEN'T HIT SOMEONE).  BEING ON SOCIAL SECURITY,WE THOUGHT PAYING EXTRA, FOR AND EXTENDED WARRANTY WOULD PROTECT US.  (A WASTED $1800.00) THE PAYMENT TAKES ALMOST HALF OUR INCOME, WE CAN'T AFFORD TO FIX THE MANUFACTURERS MISTAKES.   BY LOOKING AT THE OTHER COMPLAINTS, WE'RE NOT THE FIRST WITH THE ABOVE PROBLEMS.  VERY UNHAPPY CONSUMER.  OUR FIRST PAYMENT ON THE BLAZER WAS 1-14-02, WE BEGAN HAVING THESE PROBLEMS 6 MONTHS LATER.         *TT",
