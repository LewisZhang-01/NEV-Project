I ALMOST HAD AN ACCIDENT WHEN COMING OUT OF A PARKING LOT ONTO A  4 LANE ROAD, I WAS TURNING LEFT.  THERE WAS PLENTY OF TIME TO MAKE IT BUT   THE TRANSMISSION FAILED TO ENGAGE. THE CAR ROLLED OUT ONTO THE ROAD BECAUSE I WAS ON A SMALL INCLINE AND NEARLY GOT HIT BY TRAFFIC AS THE ENGINE STRUGGLED TO ENGAGE.  HYUNDAI IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM BUT ACCORDING TO THEM THAT'S HOW THE CAR IS SUPPOSED TO WORK. IT IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS FLAW THAT THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF AN NO LONGER USE THIS SYSTEM IN 2019 TUCSON.  THEY KNOW IT'S A FLAW AND REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING TO ASSIST.",
