        "summary": "MY WIFE, THREE KIDS AND MYSELF WERE IN OUR 2006 FORD EXPEDITION LIMITED COMING DOWN A MOUNTAIN PASS IN LAKE TAHOE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE ENGINE STOPPED!  A CODE ON THE DASH READ \"FAIL SAFE ENGINE MODE\".  THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED AND THERE WAS NO POWER, NO ACCELERATION.  I WAS LUCKY TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  THE FOLLOWING DAY, I TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE CARSON CITY, NV FORD DEALER AND PAID FOR A DIAGNOSTIC. NOTES FROM DEALER:  ROAD TEST COULD NOT VERIFY.  PERFORMED EEC SELF TEST, HAS CODE P0104.  PERFORMED WIGGLE TEST AND PINPOINT TESTS.  PERFORMED RECORDER-MONITOR TEST ALL THE PIDS LOOKED GOOD.  REMOVED THE MAF SENSOR.  HAS DEBRIS ON THE MAF SENSOR WIRES.  RECOMMEND A NEW MAF SENSOR.\"  I PUT IN A NEW MAF SENSOR AND AIR FILTER.  IN DRIVING LESS THAN 3 MILES AFTER THIS WAS DONE, THE TRUCK DID THE SAME THING.  THE \"FAIL SAFE ENGINE MODE\" CAME ON, LOSS OF POWER AND ACCELERATION.  I HAD TO TURN THE TRUCK OFF COMPLETELY, REMOVE KEY AND RESTART.  THEN THE TRUCK DID NOT HOLD THE IDLE AND DIED.  AFTER A SECOND TIME, THE TRUCK RESTARTED.  I AM STILL DRIVING WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT OFF AND HAVE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT WITH THE FORD DEALER TOMORROW MORNING (6-24-10) TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON.  WE ARE SUPPOSED TO LEAVE TOMORROW AND DRIVE 1100 MILES  TO RETURN TO DENVER. *TR",
