AFTER REPAIR, ON 12-8-02, THE VEHICLE, WITH 2800 MILES, WOULD NOT START.  IT LEFT ME STRANDED AND HAD TO BE TOWED.    I AM TOLD THE VEHICLE REQUIRES A NEW \"INTAKE\" FOR REPAIR AND WAS \"PROBABLY\" THE CAUSE OF THE INITIAL PROBLEM.    THOUGH THE INCIDENTS ARE RATHER SIMPLE, I FIND IT REDICULOUS FOR A VEHICLE WHICH WAS MADE LESS THAN 6 MONTHS AGO.",
