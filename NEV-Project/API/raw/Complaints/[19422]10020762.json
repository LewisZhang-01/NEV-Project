        "summary": "MY FAMILY AND I HAD JUST DRIVEN ABOUT 50 MILES AND WERE GOING TO EAT DINNER, WHILE TURNING RIGHT OFF A STREET WE HEARD A LOUD POP AND THE LEFT FRONT CORNER OF THE VAN FELL. I ASSUMED WE HAD BLOWN A TIRE, BUT WHEN I GOT OUT TO LOOK, THE TIRE WAS STILL UP. AFTER JACKING UP THE VAN AND LOOKING AT THE BALL JOINTS, TIE RODS, ETC., I REALIZED THAT TORSION BAR HAD SNAPPED. FORTUNATELY THIS OCCURRED AT A LOW SPEED AND DID NOT CAUSE ME TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE VAN - 2 MINUTES EARLIER AND IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A DIFFERENT STORY. THE FIRST DEALER I CONTACTED TOLD ME THE PART WAS DISCONTINUED AND I SHOULD TRY A JUNKYARD TO GET THE PART I NEEDED. THE SECOND DEALER I CONTACTED TOLD ME THERE WAS A CONVERSION KIT I COULD BUY, BUT I HAD TO CONVERT BOTH SIDES, AND THE COST WAS \"AT LEAST\" $500. IF I HAD KNOWN I NEEDED ANOTHER $500 AND WAS RISKING THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY, I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE. HOW ABOUT SOME HELP GM?*AK",
