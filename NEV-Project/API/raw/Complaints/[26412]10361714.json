I PURCHASED A BRAND NEW VEHICLE SO I DID NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SAFETY OR REPAIRS.  THIS IS THE THIRD PILOT I HAVE HAD, AND THE SAFETY ISSUES ARE VERY CONCERNING.  AFTER THE RECALL ON THE 2004 PILOT TRANSMISSION, WHY HAVE THE SAME ISSUES COME UP AGAIN IN 2010?  MANY COMPLAINTS CAN EASILY BE FOUND REGARDING THE FAULTY TRANSMISSIONS AND WINDSHIELDS IN HONDA VEHICLES.  HOW IS IT LEGAL FOR A CAR MANUFACTURER TO CONTINUE ROLLING OUT VEHICLES WITH KNOWN SAFETY ISSUES?  AND THEY MARKET THESE VEHICLES TO FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN.  HOW ABOUT A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT AND SHUT DOWN THESE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES?  I WILL NEVER TRUST HONDA AGAIN, AFTER 15 YEARS OF LOYALTY AND TRUST THAT SAFETY SHOULD BE A CORE ISSUE. *TR",
