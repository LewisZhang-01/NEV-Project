SINCE THIS VEHICLE IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE ONE I HAD, PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC DIDN'T CONCERN ME THAT MUCH. WELL, IT DOES NOW. IT WENT JUST ENOUGH INTO THE INTERSECTION TO GET ME INTO A NEAR CRASH SITUATION. IT JUST TOTALLY BOGGED DOWN. THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR MAYBE? I HAVE TALKED TO FOUR PEOPLE WITH 2010 AND 2011 CRV'S AND THEY SAY THE SAME THING. I LOVE THIS CAR, BUT THIS HAS TO BE ADDRESSED. I HAVE HAD NO OTHER PROBLEMS EXCEPT FOR THIS. THIS IS A REAL DOWNER FOR ME IN RELATION TO THIS CAR. HELP US HONDA.  *TR",
