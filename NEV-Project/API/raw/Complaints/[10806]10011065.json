CAR HAS OCCASIONALLY DRIFTED LEFT, ALMOST CAUSING ACCIDENTS DUE TO PROBLEM.  CHRYSLER RELEASED AN INTERNAL BULLETIN ON THIS - NO 05-003-02 REV B ISSUED ON DEC 16,2002.  WELL WITHIN THE 3 YR, 36,000 MILE WARRANTY, THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT I USED REFUSED TO HONOR ANY OF THE WARRANTY PROVISIONS.  UPON FURTHER RESEARCH, I FOUND THAT THIS IS A KNOWN DEFECT, YET, NEITHER NHTSA HAS INITIATED AN INVESTIGATION INTO IT AND CHRYSLER HAS NOT SENT NOTICES OUT TO CUSTOMERS.  THE PROBLEM IS QUITE CLEAR - THE CALIPERS ARE EATING INTO THE ROTOR AND CAUSING EXCESSIVE WEAR AND TEAR (CONVENIENTLY CALLED \"WARPING\" BY CHRYSLER).   I SUPPOSE IT WILL TAKE A \"DEATH OR TWO\" BEFORE SOMETHING HAPPENS ON EITHER END.*JB",
