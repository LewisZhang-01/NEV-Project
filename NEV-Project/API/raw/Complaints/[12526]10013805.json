I REPLACED FRONT BRAKES AND INSTALLED NEW ROTORS AND PROBLEM WAS STILL THERE.  WENT BACK TO DEALERSHIP THEN THEY ADVISED ME THAT SINCE MY TIRES WERE NOT ALL THE SAME BRAND THAT WAS THE PROBLEM....NEW TIRES DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  CAR IS NOT KICKING ANY CODES OUT TO THE COMPUTER AND NO ABS LIGHT IS ON.  DEALER SPOKE TO GM TECH'S AND AT THAT POINT REPLACED BOTH FRONT ABS WIRING HARNESSES.  PROBLEM STILL EXISTS....BACK TO GM TECH'S AGAIN...RT REAR HUB WAS CHANGED THINKING IT WAS A BAD SENSOR BUT STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM.  THIS CAR HAS BEEN TO THE DEALER AT LEAST 10 TIMES NOW AND CHEVROLET WILL NOT DO A THING TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.  AT CHEVROLETS REQUEST I TOOK THE CAR TO A DIFFERENT DEALER, THE MECHANIC ACKNOWLEDGES THE PROBLEM EXISTS BUT CAN NOT FIGURE OUT WHAT IS CAUSING IT.  I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH CHEVROLET CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THE ARE RUNNING ME AROUND.*JB",
