        "summary": "I HAVE A 1999 DODGE AVENGER SPORT (2.5L AUTO). AT 48,000 MILES THE TORQUE CONVERTER FAILED ON MY AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION (INFAMOUS A604 TRANSMISSION). DODGE REFUSED A GOODWILL REPAIR, THE CAR IS JUST OUT OF WARRANTY, AND I FEEL THAT IT IS RIDICULOUS FOR A CAR THAT IS 3 YEARS OLD WITH BARELY ANY MILEAGE TO REQUIRE A TRANSMISSION REBUILD.   I HAVE SEEN MANY PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED FROM SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THEIR A604/41TE TRANSMISSION (LOOK TO BBS.ASOG.NET UNDER TRANSMISSION FORUM). I ALSO KNOW THIS TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN DEFECTIVE GOING BACK TO IT'S INTRODUCTION IN 1989. WHEN IS ENOUGH ENOUGH, AND WHEN WILL CHRYSLER BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?   NOT TO MENTION THAT I ALMOST DIED WHEN THE LIMP-HOME-MODE SWITCHED ON AS I WAS TRAVELING 70 MPH ON I-95 (THE CAR AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHED INTO SECOND GEAR FROM FOURTH, THE CAR BEHIND ME ALMOST CRASHED INTO THE REAR OF MY CAR, AND THIS CAUSED DAMAGE TO MY ENGINE). I DID NOT GET INTO AN ACCIDENT OR CAUSE ANY FATALITIES, BUT I CANNOT SEE HOW THIS TRANSMISSION OR LIMP-HOME-MODE IS SAFE. HOW CAN THEY SELL A TRANSMISSION THAT DIES UNDER 50,000 MILES? *JB",
