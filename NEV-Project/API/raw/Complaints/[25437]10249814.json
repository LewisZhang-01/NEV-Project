ALSO, WE WERE CHARGED $145 FOR NISSAN TO CHECK THE FLUID AND THEY TOLD US THAT THERE WAS BURNING.  I CALLED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND FILED A FORMAL COMPLAINT.  WE WERE TOLD THAT THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE W/04 MAXIMA OWNERS BECAUSE OF A \"DESIGN FLAW\" IN THE TRANNY.  THIS IS A SHAME BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL MAXIMA DRIVER SINCE I WAS 16.  NISSAN NEEDS TO ADMIT THEY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THESE TRANSMISSION AND A RECALL NEEDS TO BE DONE. *TR",
