JUST IN CASE I TOOK THE CAR TO MECHANIC BECAUSE 20 MINUTES LATER I STARTED TO NOTICED  AN ODOR, LIKE BURNED PLASTIC.  THIS MORNING THE MECHANIC CALLED ME AND ASKED ME TO STOP BY THE SHOP, HE SHOWED ME THE FUSE BOX AND  THE ELECTRICAL CABLES (HARNESS) THAT ARE CONNECTED TO THE BOX, 75% OR MORE ARE WITHOUT INSULATION (CRACKED OR THE INSULATION IS GONE).  ACCORDING TO HIM I WAS JUST LUCKY,  FORD DO NOT OFFER A COMPLETE ELECTRICAL HARNESS AS A PART, AND THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO SEARCH FOR ONE IN A JUNK YARD, BESIDES IS A COSTLY ELECTRICAL JOB REPLACING THE WIRES.  I AM GOING TO CONTACT FORD BECAUSE AS A CONSUMER I THINK THAT THERE IS A DEFECT WITH THE MENTIONED VEHICLE.*JB",
