        "summary": "3 INSTANCES IN THE LAST 2 WEEKS OF NEAR ACCIDENTS DUE TO SEVERE SHUDDERING/HESITATION. ALMOST T-BONED AT 3 DIFFERENT INTERSECTIONS. CAR WAS UNRESPONSIVE THEN SHUDDERED AND CONVULSED WITH NEAR MISSES. WAITED FOR NEARLY A MONTH TO GET AN APPOINTMENT TO CHECK THE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY. MULTIPLE CLUTCHES REPLACED WITH LONG BACK-ORDERS ON PARTS. CAR IS A HAZARD TO DRIVE. FORD IS NOW NOT OFFERING A WARRANTY OF ANY KIND FOR THE REPLACEMENT PARTS. I HAVE LODGED A COMPLAINT HERE IN THE PAST FOR THE SAME NEAR DEATH OR INJURY EXPERIENCES. I HAVE TRIED SINCE THE 1ST CLUTCH REPLACEMENT TO GET RELIEF FROM FORD CORP. THEY ARE UNCOOPERATIVE. DOES ANYONE EVEN READ THESE THINGS? FORD JUST POSTED HUGE PROFIT MARGINS. ARE THEY TOO POWERFUL FOR OUR GOV'T TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS LONG OCCURRING SAFETY HAZARD? WARRANTY RUNS OUT ON CAR AT 100,000. I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO GET RID OF THIS CAR, BUT I HAVE TOO MUCH INVESTED AND FORD REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THERE IS A PROBLEM. HOW CAN YOUR AGENCY NOT HAVE DONE AN INTERVENTION? IF YOU WANT SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT THE NUMEROUS NEAR MISSES AND THE CAT LIKE 9 LIVES I MUST POSSESS, PLEASE, FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME.",
