        "summary": "COMPLAINT TYPE INVOLVES A PAINT DEFECT.  I PURCHASED A NEW 2001 MITSUBISHI MIRAGE FROM PATRIOT FORD  - MITSUBISHI IN BECKLEY, WV.  I BOUGHT IT IN DECEMBER 2000.  THE FOURTH DAY I HAD THE CAR I BRUSHED SNOW OF THE HOOD AND PAINT CAME OFF WITH IT.  FOR THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS PAINT CAME OFF MOSTLY WHEN IT WAS WASHED.   THE DEALERSHIP OFFERED TO PAY FOR PAINTING ONLY PART OF THE CAR.  THIS WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE.  THE DEALERSHIP REFUSED TO PAY FOR A TOTAL PAINT JOB ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHY A BRAND NEW CAR SHOULD NEED ANY PART OF IT PAINTED BUT I COUNTINUED TO GET THE RUN AROUND FOR ANOTHER FOUR  MONTHS AT WHICH A LONG AWAITED MITSUBISHI REPRESENTED INSECTED THE CAR AND OFFERED TO PAY 30% OF A TOTAL PAINT JOB.  I REFUSED STILL NOT BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHY A NEW CAR WOULD NEED A PAINT JOB.  I TOOK IT TO AUTO BODY SHOPS IN THE AREA AND WAS TOLD A FEW TIMES IT WAS ROAD DEBRIE CAUSING THE PAINT TO FLAKE OFF.   THE SHOPS TOLD ME THEY WORKED WITH PATRIOT FORD.   I HAD A LAWYER FOR A PERIOD OF TIME WHO COULD  NOT MAKE ANY HEADWAY WITH THE MITUSUBISHI MANUFACTURER.  AFTER MUCH FRUSTRATION I FANALLY DROPPED THE MATTER BUT HAVE RECENTLY DECIDED TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT.  ANY HELP YOU CAN GIVE ME WITH THE MATTER WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.",
