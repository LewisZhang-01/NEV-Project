        "summary": "FUEL LINES RUSTED AND LEAKING. LEAK LOCATED ON DRIVERS SIDE JUST BEFORE REAR TIRE. UPON EXAMINATION IT APPEARS THAT THE TWO FUEL LINES ARE WRAPPED WITH INSULATION  OF SOME SORT DUE TO THE LINES PROXIMITY TO THE EXHAUST. THIS INSULATION HAS BEEN TRAPPING MOISTURE FOR YEARS CAUSING THE OXIDATION OF NON STAINLESS STEEL FUEL LINES. THIS DANGEROUS CONDITION WAS NOTICED WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS STOPPED. I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO A MECHANIC AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE LINES MUST BE REPLACED WHICH WILL COST APPROX 650 DOLLARS. THE MECHANIC INFORMED ME THAT HE IS FAMILIAR WITH THIS COMMON SAFETY HAZARD ATTACHED TO THIS MODEL.   I ALSO HAVE NOW READ OTHER COMPLAINTS REGARDING THIS DANGEROUS PROBLEM.   I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT THE NHTSA USE ITS CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE WITH THE MANUFACTURER OF THIS VEHICLE TO ENACT A SAFETY RECALL FOR THIS HAZARD ON THIS MODEL AND ALL VEHICLES THAT MAY HAVE THIS DEFECT. THIS SAFETY VIOLATION HAS BEEN REPORTED TO YOUR ORGANIZATION, TO CHEVROLET DEALERSHIPS AND TO GENERAL MOTORS' CHEVROLET DIVISION FOR YEARS AND THOSE NOTIFICATIONS HAVE ALL BEEN IGNORED. WILL IT TAKE MULTIPLE HORRENDOUS TRAGEDIES BEFORE SOMEBODY DOES THE RIGHT THING. DOES AN AMERICAN CAR COMPANY NEED ANOTHER FORD PINTO-LIKE (AKA \"PINTORCH\") NEGATIVE PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN ON ITS HANDS?I  I CANNOT FATHOM WHY A COMPANY THAT ISSUED A RECALL FOR A PLASTIC LATCH FOR A DASHBOARD DOOR AND HAS SCOFFED AT FOLKS FOR NOTIFYING THEM OF THIS VERY PREVENTABLE SAFETY HAZARD.",
