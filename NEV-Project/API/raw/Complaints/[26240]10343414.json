NOT LEAKING AT SEAL OR NORMAL CONNECTION POINT.  IS COMING THROUGH THE METAL ITSELF.  THEY SAID THE METAL HAS BECOME ' POROUS '.  LAST 4 RUNNER HAD 340,000 MILES ON IT AND NEVER HAD A DROP COME THROUGH THE METAL AND WAS USED EXTENSIVELY OFF ROAD.  THIS VEHICLE MINIMALLY.  THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A DEFECTIVE PART THROUGH SUBSTANDARD MANUFACTURING PROCESS OR INFERIOR METAL.  I AM GETTING NO HELP FROM DEALER IN FIXING THIS PROBLEM.  HAVE SEEN ALOT OF PEOPLE WITH SAME ISSUE ON LINE AND WAS REFERRED TO THIS SITE THROUGH A LINK.  *TR",
