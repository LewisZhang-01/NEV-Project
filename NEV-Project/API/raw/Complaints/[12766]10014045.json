        "summary": "IN BOTH MY 2001 SAAB 9-5 AND MY 1999 SAAB 9-3, UPON ENTERING THE VEHICLE WHEN I LOCK THE ELECTRONIC DOORS AND TURN THE IGNITION KEY IN QUICK SUCCESSION, THE DOOR LOCKS OPEN.  ALTHOUGH THIS PROBLEM WAS DEMONSTRATED TO THE SAAB DEALER, THEY COULD NOT REMEDY THE PROBLEM.  I BELIEVE THEIR HAS BEEN A CHRONIC PROBLEM OF ELECTRICAL CHARGE BUILD-UP IN THE IGNITION CONSOLE (WHERE THE DOOR LOCK SWITCH IS LOCATED), AND WHEN LOCKING THE DOORS AND STARTING THE IGNITION ARE PERFORMED IN QUICK SUCCESSION, IT CAUSES AN ELECTRICAL SHORT WHICH POPS OPEN THE LOCKS.  MY 1996 SAAB 900 HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM, BUT IN THAT CASE, AFTER LOWERING THE WINDOWS (SWITCHES ALSO IN IGNITION CONSOLE), THERE WAS AN ELECTRICAL CHARGE BUILD-UP WHICH PREVENTED RAISING THE WINDOWS FOR APPROXIMATELY 3-5 SECONDS. *JB",
