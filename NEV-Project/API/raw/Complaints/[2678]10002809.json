        "summary": "IGNITION COILS OF A 2002 VW JETTA 1.8T \"BURNED OUT\" ACCORDING TO THE DEALER. HE INFORMED ME THIS IS A KNOWN AND WIDESPREAD ISSUE. THIS CAUSES THE CAR TO BEHAVE IRRATICALLY, CAUSING MY VEHICLE TO LUNGE FORWARD WHILE IDLING AT A RED LIGHT, AND VIBRATE VIOLENTLY WHILE DRIVING AT 20 MPH ON MY RESIDENTIAL STREET.   AFTER DOING RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET TALKIGN TO THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER WHO TOWED THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP, AND INFORMATION FROM THE DEALERSHIP'S MECHANIC, I HAVE FOUND THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF OTHER OWNERS HAVE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM WITH THIS PART.    VW NORTH AMERICA WILL NOT ISSUE A RECALL VOLUNTARILLY, AND THIS COULD CAUSE A SERIOUS OR FATAL DRIVING CONDITION IF THIS HAPPENS WHEN TRAVELLING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND THE CAR BEGINS TO VIOLENTLY SHAKE AND VIBRATE AS IT DID WHEN I WAS DRIVING, AND I FEEL THAT IT WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION BY THE NHTSA TO SEE IF AN ACROSS THE BOARD RECALL IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT BOTH OWNERS OF THESE VEHILCLES, AS WELL AS THOSE WHO SHARE THE ROAD WITH US.    I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM THAT VOLDWAGEN CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF THESE COILS TO REPLACE IN THOSE OF US WHO NEED THEM, LET ALONE A RECALL DUE TO THE SHEER NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE BREAKING DOWN DUE TO THIS... THIS REALLY SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO BEFORE IT KILLS SOMEONE .",
