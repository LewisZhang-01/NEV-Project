LIGHTS WOULD TURN ON RADIO, ETC..  I WAS STRANDED AND HAD TO HAVE MY CAR TOWED THE NEXT DAY TO THE DEALERSHIP AND DISCOVERED THAT THE STEERING LOCK MECHANISM (PART NUMBER 48700-9N00B) HAD BROKE NOT ALLOWING THE STEERING WHEEL TO LOCK SO CAR WOULD START.  THE CAR ONLY HAS 34,545 MILES ON IT, HOWEVER, AGE OF CAR IS 3 YR 5 MONTH SO NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  AFTER EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET, IT HAS BEEN CONFIRMED THAT AN ALARMING NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS DUE TO THE SAME ISSUE WITH REPAIRS RUNNING $1,000 ON AVERAGE HAVE BEEN FOUND. I AND OTHERS FEEL THIS PART SHOULD BE RECALLED OR COVERED MY THE MANUFACTURER.  IT IS UNREASONABLE THAT HIS PARTICULAR PART WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACE AS MANY TIMES AS IT HAS. BY LEAVING CONSUMERS STRANDED AND UNABLE TO OPERATE THEIR CARS DUE TO A DEFECTIVE PART NOT ONLY BECOMES NUISANCE, BUT IN MY OPINION, A SAFETY HAZARD.  *TR",
