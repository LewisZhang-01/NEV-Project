LEXUS COULD/WOULD NOT REPLACE JUST THE SMALL METAL PIECE, AND THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY HAD TO BE REPLACED CAUSING A VERY COSTLY REPAIR; THIS OCCURED IN 2003. IN MAY OF 2004, THE DRIVER'S DOOR THEN FAILED, AND ALSO WOULD NOT OPEN FROM THE OUTSIDE, WOULD ONLY OPEN FROM THE INSIDE. THIS TIME THEY WERE ABLE TO CORRECT WITH A $7.00 PART AND A $120 LABOR COST TO REPLACE.*AK",
