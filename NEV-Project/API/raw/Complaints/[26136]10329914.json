ON-LINE COMPLAINTS INDICATE THIS IS A  COMMON PROBLEM RESULTING FROM DEFECTIVE CONTROL UNIT IN THIS AND OTHER TOYOTA VEHICLES OVER SEVERAL YEARS. THE CONTROL KNOW COMES LOOSE AND THEN THE WIRING BEHIND IT BREAKS FROM THE CIRCUIT BOARD RESULTING IN ERRATIC AIR TEMPERATURES. I ALSO HAVE CONCERN THAT THIS ELECTRICAL FAILURE COULD CAUSE OTHER ELECTRICAL SHORTS OR PROBLEMS. DEALER RECOMMENDS REPLACEMENT OF ENTIRE CONTROL UNIT AT PRICES RANGING FROM $500 TO $1500. ON-LINE CONSUMERS REPORT FIX ONLY REQUIRES RESOLDERING THE 3-WIRE CONTACTS AT A COST OF A FEW DOLLARS. IT IS OBVIOUS TOYOTA KNOWS ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THE RELATIVELY EASY FIX DOCUMENTED WITH PICTURES ON-LINE BUT CONTINUES TO DENY THAT IT IS THEIR PROBLEM. IT IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH SEVERAL YEARS AGO, BUT CHARGING OWNERS HUGE FEES FOR REPLACING A SIMPLE COMPONENT SEEMS TO BE WHAT TOYOTA FEELS IS THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION. *TR",
