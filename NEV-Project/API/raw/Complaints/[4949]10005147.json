ONLY TO SEE THAT THE FRONT DRIVER SIDE OF MY CAR IS NOW RESTING THE WHEEL WELL ON THE TIRE, THE TIRE ABOUT TO JUST FALL OVER, MY FRAME BY THE DOOR ALL CRUSHED BACK FROM THE TIRE, AND MY AXEL ON THE GROUND. HAD I BEEN ON THE HIGHWAY I COULD HAVE JUST KISSED MYSELF GOODBYE. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY MITSUBISHI NEVER INFORMED ME OF THIS. I LOOKED FOR THE PROBLEM ONLINE AND HERE'S WHAT I FOUND -  PROBLEM:~>WHEEL BEARINGS LEAKING OIL, CAN ROTATE CASING MORE THAN 3 INCHES, ACCORDING TO DEALER. WHOLE CASING COULD SEPARATE, CAUSING CRASH.",
