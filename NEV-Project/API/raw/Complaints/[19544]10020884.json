FINALLY, I ATTEMPTED TO START THE BIKE AND THE STARTER WOULD NOT ENGAGE, (JUST SPINNING UP).  I HAD TO HAVE THE BIKE TOWED ($75) TO THE DEALER WHO IS AWARE OF THE ISSUE.  WHEN I CALLED SUZUKI USA THEY REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE.  AFTER SOME RESEARCH I DISCOVERED THAT THE ISSUE IS DISCUSSED IN TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN 126 ISSUED BY SUZUKI.  THEY WILL UPGRADE THE STARTER GEAR PARTS ONLY WHEN FAILURE OCCURS.  I FEEL THEY SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL. *AK",
