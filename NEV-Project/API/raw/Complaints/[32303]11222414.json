IF I HAD NOT HAD THE SUN SHADE PULLED CLOSED, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN SHOWERED IN GLASS!  I HAD A TRUCK CAMPER ON THE TRUCK AT THE TIME, HOWEVER, I'VE DRIVEN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES WITH THIS CAMPER, SO IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT - AND THE GLASS OUGHT TO BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR THIS USAGE ANYWAY.    THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED, AND THE TYPE OF GLASS THAT IS USED SHOULD NOT ALLOW GLASS TO SHATTER INTO FLYING PIECES LIKE THAT!  THIS IS COSTING ME A BUNDLE OF MONEY TO REPAIR, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, HAD THE SUN SHADE NOT BEEN CLOSED, I COULD HAVE HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH 6+ TONS OF TRUCK AND CAMPER.",
