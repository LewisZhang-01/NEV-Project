THE DEALER HAD A UNIT IN STOCK WHICH HAD THIS OPTION AND I HAD ITS OPERATION DEMONSTRATED.  MUCH TO MY SURPISE, IT DID NOT HAVE AN AUTOMATIC REVERSE NOR SHUTOFF  FOR OBSTRUCTIONS.  THE SALESMAN WAS UNABLE TO ADDRESS MY CONCERNS OVER THIS DANGEROUS AND FLAWED DESIGN.  AS A PHYSICIAN AND FATHER OF A FOUR YEAR OLD CHILD, I FEEL AN OBLIGATION TO DRAFT THIS COMPLAINT IN AN ATTEMPT TO PREVENT A SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.  I WILL ALSO FORWARD THIS TO MERCEDES-BENZ AS WELL.  THANK YOU.",
