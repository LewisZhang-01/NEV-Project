THE NEW ROTORS HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO WARP, LESS THAN 2 MONTHS AFTER INSTALLATION. NOTE: BRAKE PADS SHOW NO UNUSUAL WEAR AND HAVEN'T BEEN REPLACED; THE PADS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE SACRIFICIAL PART, NOT THE ROTORS!!! ALL WORK HAS BEEN PERFORMED BY CLEAR LAKE DODGE AND ALLEN SAMUELS CHRYSLER, BOTH IN HOUSTON; AT NO TIME HAS EITHER PLACE MENTIONED ANY SYSTEMIC PROBLEM WITH DAKOTA BRAKE ROTORS.     *AK",
