THE MODELS AFFECTED ARE FROM THE 2014 AND 2015 MODEL YEARS FOR THE RAM 4500 AND 5500.  THIS BULKHEAD CONNECTOR IS LOCATED NEAR FRONT WHEEL SPLASH AND IT IS NOT PROPERLY PROTECTED.  WHEN WATER ENTER THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR, THE TCM CAN SHORT CIRCUIT AND AN INPUT SPEED SENSOR CAN SHORT CIRCUIT WITHOUT PRIOR WARNING TO THE DRIVER WHICH RENDERS THE TRUCK TO LOSE THE TRANSMISSION FUNCTIONALITY WHILE IN MOTION.  FCA WESTERN REGIONAL MANAGERS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED AND THE FCA FIX IS TO APPLY DIELECTRIC GREASE TO THE CONNECTOR, WHICH IS NOT A LONG-TERM SOLUTION. DIELECTRIC GREASE WILL WASHOUT IN TIME.  A PROPER SOLUTION INVOLVES A PROPER SPLASH SHIELD OR RELOCATING THE ENTIRE HARNESS AWAY FROM WHEEL SPLASH.",
