I HAD NEW FRONT STRUTS AND TIRES INSTALLED BY A NATIONAL TIRE DEALER AND LATER FOUND OUT FROM ONE OF THE TECH'S WITH EXPERIENCE WITH NISSAN THAT IT IS A COMMON FLAW ON THIS MODEL.  HE SAID THAT THE TRAILING ARMS/LINKS FAIL ON THE REAR SUSPENSION.  HE FURTHER SAID THAT UPDATED LINKS ARE AVAILABLE FROM NISSAN.  THERE  ALSO HAVE BEEN FACTORY BULLETINS ON THIS BUT I HAVE NOT RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE.  I BELIEVE THE CONDITION TO BE DANGEROUS ENOUGH TO WARRANT ONE.  THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENS IT COULD RESULT IN A LIFE THREATENING ACCIDENT.  I HAD MY WIFE AND TWO SMALL CHILDREN IN THE CAR THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED UNEXPECTEDLY.  I THINK ITS TERRIBLE THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE ISSUED A RECALL SINCE THEY WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM.  I THINK A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED AND THAT IT SHOULD BE REPAIRED AT NO COST TO CONSUMER SINCE IT INVOLVES A SAFETY ISSUE.   *NLM",
