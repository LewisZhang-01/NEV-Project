THE MECHANIC WHO REPLACED IT EXPLAINED THERE IS A DEFECTIVE VALVE IN THE TRANSMISSION FLUID LINE THAT STICKS WHEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY DENYING THE TRANSMISSION FLUID THEREBY BURNING IT UP.  CHRYSLER IS AWARE OF THIS DEFECT BUT REFUSES TO OWN UP TO THE DEFECT.  THEY REPLACED MY TRANSMISSION WITH ANOTHER DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION WHICH I WAS TOLD THE DAY AFTER INSTALLING THE NEW TRANSMISSION WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED AGAIN.  I CALLED CHRYSLER TO ASK WHAT THEY INTEND TO DO REGARDING NOT ONLY OWNING UP THE DEFECTIVE VALVE BUT ALSO WHAT THEY WERE WILLING TO DO FOR ME DUE TO THE INCONVENIENCE OF HAVING TO NOT HAVE MY VEHICLE FOR A WEEK UNTIL THEY CAN REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION AGAIN, AND WAS TOLD THEY WERE WILLING TO DO NOTHING ON EITHER ISSUE.",
