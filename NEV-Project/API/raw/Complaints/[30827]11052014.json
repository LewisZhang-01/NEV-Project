        "summary": "THE REAR PASSENGER WHEEL WELL IS COMPLETELY ROTTED AROUND THE CONNECTION FOR THE SHOCK ABSORBER.  NO BODY SHOP WILL REPAIR AS IT IS TOO COSTLY AND TOO MUCH OF A LIABILITY THEY CLAIM.  DRIVING ALONG AND SUDDENLY THE CAR GOT LOUD IN THE BACK.  SHOCK ABSORBER HAD COME THROUGH THE INTERIOR OF THE AUTOMOBILE. CAR HAS RUST ON BACK \"TRUNK\" DOOR AND A ON THE EDGE OF THE WHEEL WELL EXTERIOR ON THE SAME SIDE, BUT REMAINING PARTS OF THE CAR HAVE VERY LITTLE OR NO RUST.  BUT WHEN YOU LOOK INSIDE THE WHEEL WELL YOU SEE ALL THE RUST AROUND THE SHOCK ABSORBER. GOOGLE SEARCH SHOWS I AM NOT ALONE WITH THIS ISSUE - OTHERS REPORT SAME ISSUE WITH PASSENGER SIDE REAR AND PEOPLE ARE CONSIDERING SUEING FORD.  2001-2004 ESCAPES HAD A CORROSION RECALL ON THE FRONT SUSPENSION, BUT THERE IS NOTHING FOR YEARS 2005 AND NEWER.  THIS IS SHOULD BE LOOKED AT.",
