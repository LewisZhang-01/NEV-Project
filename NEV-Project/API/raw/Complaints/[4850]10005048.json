SINCE I NOTICED MY DOOR CRACKED I'VE BEN ON THE LOOK OUT FOR OTHER CRACKED DOORS. TO DATE AND AT RANDOM I HAVE FOUND 11 OUT OF 14 F-150'S WITH ONE OR BOTH DOORS CRACKED.SO FAR I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TELL 4 OUT OF THE 11 THAT THEIR DOOR WAS CRACKED AND NOT A ONE HAD A CLUE THEIR DOOD WAS CRACKED UNTIL I TOLD THEM. ON THE INTERNET I HAVE SEEN 100'S OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM. FROM WHAT I CAN TELL FORD HAD THIS PROBLEM IN 1997, 1998, 1999, AND 2000. WHAT DOES A PERSON HAVE TO DO TO HAVE SOME ONE REALIZE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THIS PROBLEM.FORD HAS A BIG PROBLEM AND SEEMS TO WANT TO DO NOTHING TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.",
