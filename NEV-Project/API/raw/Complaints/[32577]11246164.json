I PULLED OVER AND THE CAR WAS OVERHEATING.I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO SHOP TO FIND OUT THAT THERE WAS A CRACK IN MY ENGINE BLOCK. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES WITH THIS CAR. NO COOLANT LEAKS OR LOW COOLANT OBSERVED. JUST HAD OIL CHANGE THE WEEK BEFORE AND MECHANIC SAID THAT EVERYTHING LOOKED FINE. I HAVE MAINTAINED THE CAR REGULARLY. AFTER RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE I FOUND THAT HONDA HAS KNOW ABOUT THIS SINCE 2013. I NEVER RECEIVED A NOTICE OR WAS MADE AWARE OF THIS. I HAVE HAD THE CAR TO A HONDA DEALER FOR RECALL ON AIRBAGS AND SUN VISOR AND NO ONE EVER MENTIONED ANYTHING ABOUT A CRACK IN THE ENGINE BLOCK.  HONDA SAID THEY WILL NOT PAY FOR REPAIR BECAUSE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED. I WASN'T EVEN AWARE OF THIS WARRANTY AND HAVE NOT HAD ANY ISSUES WITH COOLANT LEAK OR OVERHEATING TO EVEN CAUSE CONCERN. THEY ARE PUTTING A REBUILD ENGINE IN AT MY EXPENSE OVER $3000. I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE. I NEED A CAR TO GET TO WORK.",
