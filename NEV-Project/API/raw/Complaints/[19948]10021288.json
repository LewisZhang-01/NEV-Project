HAD BEEN CHECKING AND ADDING COOLANT REGULARLY. PROBLEM HAD INCREASED AND HAD IT CHECKED AGAIN IN MARCH 2003 WHILE THE VAN WAS IN FOR A RECALL NOTICE. THIS TIME THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD COST $600.00 + TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THE VAN HAS STARTED HAVING SUDDEN SWINGS IN THERMOSTAT READINGS AND USING OVER A QUART OF COOLANT A WEEK. I HAVE READ OF OTHERS COMPLAINING ON THIS SITE OF THE SAME PROBLEM AND WORSE. I ALSO REVIEWED NUMEROUS SERVICE BULLETINS FROM PONTIAC REGARDING THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM. WHY WOULD GM NOT OFFER TO HELP CORRECT THIS PROBLEM IF THEY KNOW ABOUT IT?*AK",
