THIS PREVENTS ME FROM LOCKING MY CAR ANY WAY OTHER THAN MANUALLY PUSHING THE STICK LOCK. IT WILL NOT LOCK BY PRESSING THE KEY FOB OR PUSHING THE LOCK BUTTON INSIDE THE CAR. I HAD THE PASSENGER'S SIDE REPLACED. TODAY (7/3/2010) MY DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR ACTUATOR WENT OUT. AFTER SEARCHING ONLINE, I SEE THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 2003-2007 MODEL HONDA ACCORDS. IN ORDER TO REPLACE ONE DOOR ACTUATOR WITH THE DEALERSHIP IT IS OVER 200.00. I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THE OTHER OWNERS OF HONDAS WHO HAVE BEEN HAVING THIS PROBLEM, I FEEL IT'S SO FREQUENT,  THAT HONDA SHOULD BE ASSISTING THEIR CUSTOMERS WITH THIS ISSUE.  *TR",
