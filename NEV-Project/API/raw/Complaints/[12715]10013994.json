WE WERE TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT WE NEED TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE FRONT BRAKE SYSTEM @ LESS THAN 25,000.00 MILES, TO THE TUNE OF $500.00 ALL PAID BY ME.  WHEN I ASKED ABOUT THE WARRANTY I WAS TOLD  THE BRAKE WEAR WAS DUE TO MY DRIVING, BUT I HAVE SINCE FOUND OUT  THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM FROM OTHER OWNERS OF THE SAME CAR.  *JB",
