I HAVE HAD IT INTO THE DEALER SEVERAL TIMES, BUT THEY SAID THEY CANNOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG.  DURING THE SUMMER I GOT A NOTICE THAT ISUZU WOULD BE \"FIXING\" BRAKES ON VARIOUS CARS - IT WAS NOT A RECALL, BUT THEY WERE GOING TO BE DOING IT FOR SAFETY REASONS.  THE CARS WERE, I BELIEVE, 98 AND 99 AMIGOS AND RODEOS, OF WHICH MINE IS ONE.  I CALLED ISUZU AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD BE SENDING NOTICES OUT IN THE FALL.  IT IS NOW THE END OF FEBRUARY AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANOTHER WORD AND AM NOT ABLE TO GET ANY INFORMATION.  MY BRAKES JUST DON'T SEEM TO WORK PROPERLY AND I DON'T THINK THEY EVER HAVE.  IT IS LIKE IT TAKES LONGER TO STOP THAN IT SHOULD.*JB",
