I PULLED THE FUSE FROM THE HORN SO THAT IT DOESN'T HONK WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD OR BEING PARKED IN MY GARAGE OVERNIGHT.    RECENTLY I HAVE REPLACED THE ALTERNATOR AND BATTERY AND THE VEHICLE WILL NOT START IN THE MORNING AFTER SITTING ALL NIGHT LONG. I DRIVE THE VEHICLE TO WORK PARK IT AND WHEN I GET READY TO LEAVE THE OFFICE FOR THE DAY THE VEHICLE IS DEAD ONCE AGAIN. SOMETHING IS DRAINING THE BATTERY...WE HAVE NOTHING PLUGGED INTO ANY OUTLETS OR CIGARETTE LIGHTERS INSIDE THE VEHICLE. EVEN DOUBLE CHECKED THAT ALL INTERIOR LIGHTS ARE OFF.",
