FOR ANYONE DRIVING A NORMAL CAR, THESE LIGHTS CREATE MAJOR GLARE AND SAFETY PROBLEMS.  I SUGGEST BANNING THE HIGH INTENSITY HEADLIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY (THE REGULAR HALOGEN LIGHTS ARE A GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN LIGHT GENERATION AND NOT BLINDING OTHER DRIVERS) AND FORCING THE SUV MANUFACTURERS TO MOVE THE HEADLIGHTS LOWER ON THE FRONT OF SUV'S SO THAT THEY DO NOT BLIND ONCOMING OR PRECEDING DRIVERS.  THANK YOU!   *NLM",
