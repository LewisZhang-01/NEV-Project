MY CONCERN IS THIS SEEMS TO BE A VERY COMMON ISSUE WITH THE 1999 YEAR MODEL SILVERADO CHEVROLET PICKUPS.  THIS VALVE IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND I HOPE THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN BUT IF IT DOES I DON'T FEEL THIS IS FAIR TO THE OWNERS OF THESE VEHICLES.  I SEE THERE HAS BEEN 47 COMPLAINTS LOGGED TO DATE AND I KNOW OF AT LEAST ONE OTHER THAT HAS NOT LOGGED A COMPLAINT.  THE FIX IS EITHER REPLACE THE VALVE OR DISCONNECT THE SYSTEM SO THE ANTI LOCK SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK.  I FEEL WE ( THE PUBLIC ) PAY ENOUGH FOR THESE VEHICLES THAT WE ARE ENTITLED THE FEATURES WE PAY FOR.    *NLM",
