        "summary": "I BOUGHT A USED 2003 KIA SEDONA WITH 136000 MILES.  THE DAY AFTER PURCHASING THE VEHICLE, THE SRS INDICATOR LIGHT STARTED STAYING LIT ON THE DASH.  MY MECHANIC FOUND THAT THE CODE WAS B1513, WHICH INDICATED A PROBLEM WITH THE PASSENGER SEAT BELT BUCKLE (FEMALE END).  THEY ORDERED THAT PART NEW FROM KIA AND REPLACED IT (FOR A COST OF $238).  THE INDICATOR LIGHT DID NOT DISPLAY FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS WHEN IT WENT ON AGAIN.  THIS TIME, THE CODES WERE B1511 AND B1513, WHICH INDICATES PROBLEMS WITH BOTH THE DIVER AND PASSENGER BUCKLES.  MY MECHANIC BELIEVES IT IS A WIRING ISSUE, AND AT THIS POINT WE ARE NOT REPLACING THE SEATBELTS, BECAUSE I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING THAT IT WOULD REALLY RESOLVE THE ISSUE.  THE COST TO REPLACE THE SRS WIRING IS PROHIBITIVE (OVER $1000). I FEEL VERY UNSAFE IN THIS VEHICLE, AS NO ONE CAN SAY FOR SURE THAT MY AIRBAGS WILL STILL DEPLOY IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT.    IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE THE VEHICLE STILL DRIVES VERY WELL.  KIA SHOULD BE MORE PROACTIVE ABOUT REPLACING/REPAIRING FAULTY SRS COMPONENTS, EVEN IN OLDER VEHICLES.  *TR",
