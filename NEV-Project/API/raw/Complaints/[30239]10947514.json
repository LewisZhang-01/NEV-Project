CAR THEN STOPPED AND THERE WAS NO POWER AT ALL.  I PUT ON MY HAZARD LIGHTS AND TURNED THE CAR OFF WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND IT STARTED AND ONLY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT REMAINED ON.  I WAS FORTUNATE TO BE ALMOST AT  A RED  LIGHT WHEN THIS HAPPENED IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN SO THAT THERE WAS ONLY BLARING HORNS WHEN I COULDN'T MOVE THE CAR.   MY MECHANIC SAID I NEED TO BRING THE CAR IN WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE ON SO THAT HE CAN READ THE ERROR MESSAGES.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT DOESN'T GIVE HIM ENOUGH INFORMATION.   I HAVEN'T DRIVEN SINCE AS I'M AFRAID BUT WILL DRIVE LOCALLY AND BRING THE CAR TO THE MECHANIC AS SOON AS THOSE LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN.  IT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE BUT NOT WHEN I COULD BRING IT TO THE MECHANIC.  *TR",
