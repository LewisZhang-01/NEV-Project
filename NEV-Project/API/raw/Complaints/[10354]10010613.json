THERE IS A CIRCULAR DISK OF HARD PLASTIC WHICH HOLDS ON A SMALL BUNGEE WHICH IN TURN HOLDS A CHILD SEAT BELT ADJUSTER.  AS I WAS GETTING IN, MY ARM CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE PLASTIC DISK AND VERY NEATLY SLICED SEVERAL LAYERS OF MY SKIN OFF.  IT WASN'T AN ATYPICAL ENTRANCE TO A VEHICLE, IN OTHER WORDS, I WASN'T FOOLING AROUND OR BEING INCAUTIOUS IN ANY WAY.  I'VE NEVER COMPLAINED ABOUT ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE, BUT I DON'T WANT MORE PEOPLE TO GET ACCIDENTALLY CUT.  THAT HARD PLASTIC DISK IS AS SHARP AS A KNIFE!   *NLM",
