        "summary": "THE STEERING ON THIS CAR EXHIBITS \"PLAY\" AT THE CENTER POINT OF THE STEERING (CAR GOING STRAIGHT, NOT TURNING) AND HAS FROM THE FIRST DAY I OWNED IT.  IT FEELS AS IF IT HAS A WORN OUT STEERING BOX SIMILAR TO A HIGH-MILEAGE, OLD CAR WITH RECIRCULATION BALL TYPE STEERING BOX INSTEAD OF A RACK AND PINION.   THIS PLAY CAUSES THE CAR TO DRIFT TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT WHEN DRIVING STRAIGHT DOWN THE ROAD. THIS CONDITION IS EXAGGERATED IN RAIN OR SNOW/ICE CONDITIONS WHEN THE LACK OF STEERING INPUT AND \"FEEL\" CAUSES ONE TO OVER-COMPENSATE THINKING THE CAR IS SLIDING. IT IS VERY DISCONCERTING.    DESPITE MY MANY COMPLAINTS, THE DEALERS HAVE TOLD ME THIS PLAY IS \"NORMAL\" AND \"WITHIN SPECIFICATIONS\" AND REFUSED TO DISCUSS THE SUBJECT. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. I HAVE DRIVEN SIMILAR CARS, WITH MUCH HIGHER MILEAGE, AND THEIR STEERING HAS NO PLAY WHAT SO EVER!  ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN NO \"INCIDENT\" AS A RESULT OF THIS CONDITION (YET) IT IS INDEED A SAFETY HAZARD.   *JB",
