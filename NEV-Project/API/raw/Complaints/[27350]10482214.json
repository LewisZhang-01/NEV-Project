SO I TOOK IT AND HAD THE BRAKE PADS AND ROTORS REPLACED ON THE FRONT. WELL IT STILL WAS VIBRATING WHEN I WOULD APPLY THE BRAKES. SO I WAS TOLD THAT MAYBE THE CALIPERS WAS BAD. SO A COUPLE WEEKS LATER THEY PUT ON NEW PADS, ROTORS AND CALIPERS. WELL THE VIBRATION STOPPED. WELL AT LEAST FOR ABOUT 3 MONTHS AND THE VIBRATION WHEN I APPLY MY BRAKES CAME BACK. SO I TOOK IT BACK AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY ARE GOING TO PUT SOME DEALER PADS AND ROTORS ON AND THAT SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM. SO IM WAITING TO GET THOSE PUT ON AND SEE IF IT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE LIKE THEY SAY.  *TR",
