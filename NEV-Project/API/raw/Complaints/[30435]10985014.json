AFTER MOVING BACK INTO LANE, THE STEERING WHEEL STARTED SHAKING IN A VIOLENT MANNER.  I CONTINUED TO HOLD ON TO THE STEERING WHEEL WHICH WAS SHAKING LEFT AND RIGHT IN A VERY FORCEFUL MANNER.  THE SHAKING STOPPED AND I CONTINUED DRIVING.  THE TRAFFIC WAS LIGHT, ROAD CONDITIONS PERFECT AND MY DRIVING SPEED WAS 60 MPH.  THIS CAR ONLY HAS 1079 MILES AND I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS IN ANY OTHER CAR. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH DEALER ON 5 12 2017 AND HAVE CONTACTED HYUNDAI MOTOR COMPANY TO ADVISE THEM OF THIS VERY DANGEROUS EVENT.",
