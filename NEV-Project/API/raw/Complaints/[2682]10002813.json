IT USUALLY HAPPENS AT VERY SLOW SPEED, AND AT DANGEROUS TIMES, (E.G. STOPPING FOR A CROSS WALKER). THIS HAS HAPPENED OVER A DOZEN TIMES IN THE PAST FIVE YEAARS AND HAS COME CLOSE TO NEAR FATALIITY OCCURANCES. AUTO MECHANICS SAY ONLY REPLACEMENT OF THE CONTROL WILL WORK AND THEY ARE NOT SURE IF THE PROBLEM WILL NOT REOCCUR  DATE BELOW IS THE LAST OCCURANCE..",
