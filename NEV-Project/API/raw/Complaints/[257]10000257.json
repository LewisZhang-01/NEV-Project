        "summary": "MY 2003 HONDA ACCORD EXPERIENCED AN UNINTENDED ACCELERATION WHILE IN MOTION. I INCREASED SPEED FROM 40 MPH TO 50MPH TO PASS A SLOWER MOVING VEHICLE IN MY LANE AND EXPERIENCED A SURGE OF POWER THAT I COULD NOT CONTROL BY TAKING MY FOOT OFF THE GAS. I NEEDED TO BRAKE TO RESTRAIN THE VEHICLE. THE TACHOMETER WENT TO 6000 RPM AND STAYED STEADY THE ENTIRE TIME PUTTING THE VEHICLE IN NEUTRAL   AS I PREPARED TO KILL THE IGNITION RETURNED CONTROL AND THE VEHICLE RESUMED RESPONDING.  I HAVE RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER FOR INSPECTION AND AM GETTING A RESPONSE FROM THE DEALER THAT THEY HAVE FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. I AM A 47 Y/O MALE WITH 30 YEARS DRIVING EXPERIENCE AND AM QUITE SURE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES. CRUISE CONTROL WAS NOT ENGAGED AS I WAS IN MORNING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC  I HAVE OPENED A PROBLEM TICKET WITH HONDA N0112-17-00080.   THANK YOU",
