THE SUN VISOR CAME LOOSE AND HAD TO BE TIGHTENED AGAIN.  THE CD PLAYER HAD TO BE REPLACED.  A BACKLASH OF ELECTRICITY CAUSED A FUSE TO BE REPLACED.  THE CAR DIED ON A HIGHWAY AND TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE INTACT MANIFOLD LEAKED, IT WAS TIGHTENED UP AND ONE MONTH LATER THE SAME PROBLEM HAPPENED AGAIN.  THE DRIVERS SIDE SEAT BELT DID NOT DETRACT AUTOMATICALLY.   *TT",
