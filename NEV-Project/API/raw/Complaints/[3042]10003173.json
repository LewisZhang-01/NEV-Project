DEALER SAID MAYBE IT WAS THE COMPUTER CHIP. AFTER CHECKING IT WAS TOLD THE BOTTOM HOSE ON RADIATOR HAD A LEAK CAUSE BY LOOSE MOTOR MOUNT AND DOGBONE. THEY FIXED IT FOR $187.00 AND WANTED ANOTHER $700.00 TO FIX MOTOR MOUNT AND DB. I HAD CHECKED BY ANOTHER MECHANIC AND WAS TOLD NOTHING WRONG WITH MM OR DB. I FEEL I WAS TAKEN.
