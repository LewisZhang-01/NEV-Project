I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AT ABOUT 2400 MILES AND WAS HANDED A TECHNICAL BULLETIN THAT WAS DATED FROM 1999 (PROBLEM HAS BEEN KNOWN SINCE THEN) TELLING ME THAT GM IS WORKING ON A \"FIX\". THEY DID WANT TO LOOK AT THE TRUCK TO MAKE SURE NOTHING ELSE WAS WRONG. THERE IS NO \"FIX\", JUST AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE ENGINE ALONE EVEN THOUGH I ALREADY PAID FOR THE EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THE ENTIRE VEHICLE. YOU CANNOT GET THE WARRANTY AGREEMENT MAILED TO YOU TO LOOK IT OVER, THEY WILL ONLY SEND IT IF YOU AGREE TO ACCEPT IT OVER THE PHONE. BOUGHT THE TRUCK IN GOOD FAITH AND WAS SOLD A LEMON. MAYBE IF THEIR PROFITS WERE AFFECTED BY A RECALL THEY MIGHT THINK TWICE ABOUT STEALING AND LYING TO CONSUMERS.   *NLM",
