AFTER TAKING IT INTO THE VOLVO DEALERSHIP IT WAS ASSESSED THAT THE ABS/TRACS IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE OF A FAILURE OF THE ABS/TRACS CONTROL MODULE. AFTER SOME RESEARCH I FOUND A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE WHEN THEIR SAME MODEL CAR REACHED ANYWHERE BETWEEN 50 AND 100 THOUSAND MILES. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN AND VOLVO SHOULD RECALL AND REPLACE THE PART.  *JB",
