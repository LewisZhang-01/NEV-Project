THEIR DOOR HAD TO BE UNLOCKED MANUALLY FROM INSIDE THE VEHICLE. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE IF THE PASSENGER DOORS NEED TO BE OPENED QUICKLY FROM THE OUTSIDE. THE PROBLEM DISAPPEARED AFTER ABOUT ONE WEEK. THE PROBLEM STARTED AGAIN LATE LAST MONTH. THE TOYOTA DEALER DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS AN OPEN CIRCUIT IN THE JUNCTION BLOCK AND REPLACED THE BLOCK. THEY STATED THAT THE FULL COST OF THE REPAIR WAS OVER $1000, BUT ONLY CHARGED ME $120.",
