WHY DIDN'T THEY NOTIFY ME WHEN I WAS IN THE OFFICE THAT THERE WAS A RECALL NOTICE FOR MY FAULTY IGNITION SWITCH AND THAT WAS THE PROBLEM?  THEY TOLD ME NOTHING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH MY CAR, NEVER OFFERING THE INFORMATION ABOUT MY IGNITION SWITCH. I EVEN WENT OVER WITH THE HONDA SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT MY CAR KEPT STALLING OUT WHILE DRIVING. WHEN I WOULD SIT A STOP SIGH IT WOULD CUT OFF AS SOON AS I ATTEMPTED TO PULL OUT. I FEEL THESE PEOPLE WERE RUDE TO ME BECAUSE I AM A GIRL AND DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT CARS, BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME THE TRUTH NO MATTER WHAT GENDER. DOES HONDA NOT KNOW ABOUT THEIR RECALL NOTICES?  *PH    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**770818",
