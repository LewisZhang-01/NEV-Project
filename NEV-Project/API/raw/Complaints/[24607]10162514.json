NECESSARY TO ROLL DOWN WINDOWS TO REACH OUTSIDE FOR DOOR HANDLE OR HAVE FRONT SEAT PASSENGER GET OUT AND OPEN REAR DOOR. CHILD PROOF LOCKS CHECKED AND VERIFIED SELECTED TO NORMAL OPERATING POSITION. HAVE NEVER SELECTED CHILD LOCK OUT POSITION AS WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CHILDREN. HAVE BEEN TOLD MANY FORD EXPLORER OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED SAME PROBLEM. THIS IS POTENTIALLY A SERIOUS SITUATION IF REAR SET PASSENGERS ARE UNABLE OPEN THEIR DOORS WITHOUT THE AID OF OTHERS. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT WILL COST TO HAVE THIS REPAIRED AS I HAVEN'T BEEN TO A DEALER YET.    *JB",
