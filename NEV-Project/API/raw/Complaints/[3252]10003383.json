I HAVE BEEN TO THIS DEALERSHIP (SIR WALTER CHEVROLET - RALEIGH NC) SEVENTEEN TIMES.  THEY HAVE CHANGED SEVERAL MAJOR PARTS.( CRANK SHAFT SENSOR, 2 CATYLIC CONVERTERS, MODULES, AND OTHER PARTS.  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS NECESSARY TO GO TO THE A GMC MECHANIC 17 TIMES FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.  I AM AT MY WITS END, THE NEXT PLACE I AM GOING IS TO THE NEWSPAPER AND A LAWYER.",
