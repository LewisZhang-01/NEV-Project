        "summary": "MY DAUGHTER CAME HOME LAST NIGHT AND I WENT TO CHECK HER CAR THIS MORNING AND FOUND A FLAT TIRE ON THE LEFT REAR. PUMPED IT UP AND HEARD AIR LEAKING OUT, REMOVED IT AND FOUND THE COIL SPRING STICKING OUT HAD CUT THE TIRE DOWN AND PUNCTURED IT. I REPLACED THE COIL AND STRUT AS A UNIT FROM ADVANCE WITH A MONROE WHICH HAS A 5/8 COIL SPRING, THE ORIGINAL FROM FORD WAS 1/2\". FORD HAD A RECALL , CAMPAIGN # 04V3320000 FOR THE COIL SPRINGS ON THE FRONT , WHY NOT THE REAR AS WELL? ITS APPARENT THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE REAR AS YOU HAVE 60 COMPLAINTS BEFORE MINE. DOES IT TAKE A DEATH TO MAKE THEM FIX THE PROBLEM? OUR CAR ONLY HAS 42,211 MILES ON IT TODAY WHEN I REPLACED THE STRUT AND TIRE. WE PURCHASED THE CAR FROM AN INDIVIDUAL, AT THE FORD DEALERS LOT, AS IT HAD BEEN PARKED THERE AFTER BODY WORK HAD BEEN PERFORMED AND BEEN SETTING FOR OVER A YEAR , IT ONLY HAD 18,000 MILES ON IT  2 YEARS AGO. I HAVE THE OLD STRUT WITH BROKEN SPRING, IT HAS A SMALL CRACK THAT SHOWS SOME RUST IN THE EDGE, AND HAS A DUCTILE FRACTURE  CLEAN BREAK WITH NO RUST IN IT. I'M A CAT MECHANIC  WITH SOME TRAINING IN FAILURE ANALYSIS, BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO FIGURE THIS ONE OUT.  *TR",
