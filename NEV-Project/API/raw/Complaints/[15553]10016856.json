EVERYTIME THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED THE THEY MAKE A LOUD SCREECHING NOSIE AND SOUND LIKE TWO PIECES OF BARE METAL PRESSING AGAINST EACH OTHER.  BMW IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND HAS ISSUED A \"NOTICE\" TO THEIR DEALERS, HOWEVER, THEY HAVE NO PARTS TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM.  THEY CLAIM IT IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE HOWEVER THE BMW DEALER IN RALEIGH NC TOLD ME TO \"GET THE BIKE GOING 100 MPH AND LOCK IT DOWN\".  I WAS TOLD TO DO THIS ABOUT \"2-3 TIMES\" AND IT WOULD \"BURN THE GLAZE OFF THE BRAKES\".     I AM CONVINCED THAT THIS MOTORCYCLE IS NOT SAFE TO RIDE, HOWEVER, NEITHER THE DEALER NOR BMW CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL PROPERLY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.  THERE ARE MANY OTHERS OUT THERE LIKE ME AND IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL SOMEONE IS KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS CONDITION AND BMW'S LACK OF RESPONSE.",
