        "summary": "THIS VEHICLE HAS SOME SCARY AND SOMETIMES DANGEROUS TRANSMISSION ISSUES.  IT'S NOT LIKE A NORMAL AUTOMATIC WITH A TORQUE CONVERTER, SO SOME ROUGHNESS IS EXPECTED.  BUT, THIS CAR OFTEN GRINDS GEARS, SLIPS, GRABS AND LUNGES, AND ALSO ROLLS BACK ON INCLINES.  I HAVE NEARLY BEEN IN SEVERAL ACCIDENTS WHEN I HAVE TRIED TO ACCELERATE INTO AN INTERSECTION AND THE VEHICLE DOESN'T RESPOND TO THE ACCELERATOR BEING DEPRESSED COMPLETELY TO THE FLOOR.  IT SOMETIMES ACTS AS IF YOU ARE TRYING TO START FROM A STOP IN 3RD OR 4TH GEAR.  FORD MOTORS HAS CONTINUALLY SAID THESE PROBLEMS ARE NORMAL AND THE VEHICLE NEEDS SOME BREAK-IN TIME.  WELL, THIS VEHICLE NOW HAS OVER 6,000 MILES.  I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER.  IF I GET INTO AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF THIS, THERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS TO HANDLE WITH FORD.  I KNOW I'M NOT ALONE IN THESE PROBLEMS.  I HAVE BEEN ON FORUMS WITH MANY PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES. *TR",
