MAC JONES ABOUT THE CAR AND HE WAS VERY UNCOOPERATIVE AND RUDE.    I WAS LEAD TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS A GOOD CAR.  MR. BILLY QUARRELS, THE SALESMAN WHO SHOWED ME THE CAR, STATED TO ME, THAT THE CAR WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION, A FANTASTIC QUALITY AND GOOD GRADE.  WHEN IN FACT, THE CAR NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION.  THEY ADVERTISED GOODS AND  SERVICES WITH THE INTENT NOT TO SELL THEM AS ADVERTISED.     MR. QUARRELS MADE A FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENT ABOUT THE CAR, WHEN HE SAID, \"IT WAS IN GOOD CONDITION\", \"AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT\".      THE RESPONCE I RECEIVE FROM THE COMPANY IS SIMPLY, \"WE'RE A BIG POWERFUL DEALERSHIP, DO WHAT YOU CAN\".   SO, I'M WRITING TO YOU.        THANK YOU.",
