        "summary": "GOT THE SONATA IN 2006.  WAS DILIGENT WITH THE OIL CHANGING AND THE WORKS.  IT GOT TO 127K MILES SO WE TOOK IT IN FOR THE 120MI SERVICE AS WE INTEND TO HAVE THE CAR IN ITS GOOD CONDITION .. SEEMED OK.. AFTER DRIVING IT FOR 2 WEEKS MY WIFE RESUMED TO USE  IT TO GO TO WORK.  SHE SAID ABOUT IT NEEDING ANOTHER ALIGNMENT CHECK COZ IT WAS DRIVING FUNNY.  SAID WE'LL HAVE IT CHECK ON HER NEXT DAY OFF WORK.  MY WIFE DRIVES 39 MILES TO WORK ON FREEWAY (I-70; 670. US-315), IT IS NO LAUGHING MATTER WHEN SOMEONE IS DRIVING 65 MPH MERGING AND CHANGING LANES DURING RUSH HOUR AND START LOSING CONTROL OF THE CAR.   SHE WAS TRYING TO GET TO THE SHOULDER BUT SHE COULDN'T EVEN STEER IT AND ONE BIG CLUNK SOUND THE CAR STOPPED, THE FRONT RIGHT TEAR WAS OFF.  LUCKILY SHE WASN'T INJURED, BUT SHE WAS SO SHAKEN UP, SHE DIDN'T EVEN REACH THE SIDE ROAD, AND SHE COULD EASILY  B STRUCK BY OTHER CARS, POLICE HAD TO PUSH THE CAR OFF THE ROAD.  AS WITH THE OTHER COMPLAINTS HERE, MY MECHANIC SAID ITS THE SUBFRAME AND WE CONTACTED HYUNDAI AND WAS TOLD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO THEIR DEALERS WHILE THEY REVIEW THE INCIDENT.  IM SO SHOCKED ABOUT THE COMPLAINTS ON HERE, THIS SHOULD B PUT OUT AND NOT LET PEOPLE GO THROUGH THIS. I WAS THINKING WHAT IF SHE HAS OUR CHILD WITH HER LIKE SHE USUALLY DOES... *TR",
