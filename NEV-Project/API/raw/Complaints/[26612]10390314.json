I WENT TO GET BACK INTO MY VEHICLE AND HEARD SOMEONE SAY, \"SOMETHING IS HANGING UNDER YOUR TRUCK\". WHEN I GOT OUT AND LOOKED, I SAW THE GAS TANK LAYING ON THE GROUND. UPON INSPECTION, BOTH STRAPS HAD BROKEN AND THE FUEL LINES WERE THE ONLY THING HOLDING IT TO THE TRUCK.     THIS OCCURRED ONLY ONCE SO FAR. THE TRUCK IS A 2000 F150 WITH 150,000 MILES ON IT. I REPLACED THE TWO STRAPS AFTER PURCHASING THEM FROM A DEALER.     I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THAT A 24 GALLON TANK WAS HELD UP BY TWO SMALL METAL STRAPS ATTACHED TO THE FRAME BY A BOLT ON ONE SIDE, AND A TWIST LOCK (IF YOU CAN CALL IT THAT) ON THE OTHER.    I HOPE FORD HAS FOUND A BETTER WAY TO ATTACH THESE ON THEIR NEWER VEHICLES, ESPECIALLY 4-WHEEL DRIVE.  *TR",
