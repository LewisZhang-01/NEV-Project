        "summary": "THE VAN ENGINE SHUTS DOWN WHILE IN DRIVE. THIS HAS HAPPENED 4 TIMES WITH IN A WEEK. IT HAS SHUT DOWN COMPLETELY AT AN INTERSECTION. EVEN THE HAZARDS WOULD NOT COME ON TO SHOW OTHER DRIVERS THAT I WAS BROKE DOWN.  I RECEIVED A NOTICE LAST YEAR ABOUT A RECALL FOR THE IGNITION MODULE AND I WAS PUT AN A LONG WAIT LIST TO HAVE IT FIXED. ON JANUARY 3, 2016 I HAD THE RECALL TAKEN CARE OF AT SHERWOOD SERVICE IN SALISBURY, MD. I HAVE NEVER HAD THE ENGINE FAILURE HAPPEN BEFORE HAVING THE RECALL FIXED, AND NOW, IT IS HAPPENING. WHEN THE ENGINE SHUT DOWN THE LAST TIME, MY HUSBAND WHO WAS DRIVING HAD TO CALL THE POLICE TO DIRECT TRAFFIC AROUND THE VAN UNTIL THE TOW TRUCK GOT THERE SO HE WOULD NOT BE HIT! IT BLOCKED AN INTERSECTION FOR 30 MINUTES UNTIL THE VAN WAS TOWED AWAY, WHEN THE VAN GOT HOME ON THE TOW TRUCK, IT STARTED UP WITH NO PROBLEM. EVERY TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED, THE VAN HAS BEEN IN GEAR AND DRIVING WHEN IT COMPLETELY SHUTS DOWN AND  IT HAS EITHER GONE OVER A SMALL BUMP OR BEEN TURNING. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT I HAD AN APPOINTMENT WITH SHERWOOD CHRYSLER IN SALISBURY, MD TODAY(3/22/21) AND THEY SAID THAT THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH MY VAN AND TRIED SEND  MY HUSBAND HOME IN THE VAN WITHOUT FIXING THE PROBLEM! HE INSISTED THAT THEY DRIVE IT (WHICH THEY WOULD NOT DO TODAY) TO SEE IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN. THEY STILL HAVE MY VAN.",
