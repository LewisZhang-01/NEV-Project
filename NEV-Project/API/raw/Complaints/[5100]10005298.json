THE VEHICLE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY HIT BY A LARGE TRUCK.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES.  HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE CURB, THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT HAVE STOPPED.  AFTER HAVING THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE NEAREST CHEVY SERVICE FACILITY, THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS AN INHERENT BEHAVIOR WITH ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEMS.  I TEND TO AGREE WITH HIM AS MY 2000 CHEVY SILVERADO HAD DEMONSTRATED THE SAME BEHAVIOR.  THERE WERE NO APPARENT LEAKS IN THE SYSTEM AND THE MASTER CYCLINDER WAS FULL.  AFTER THE ACCIDENT, THE VEHICLE WAS STARTED AND THE BRAKE PEDAL CONTINUED TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS IN PARK.  THE SERVICE FACILITY WAS NOT ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE BEHAVIOR THE NEXT MORNING AND REFERRED ME TO GM CUSTOMER SERVICE WHERE A CASE HAS BEEN FILED.",
