MY POWER STEERING HAS GONE OUT MANY TIMES, SOME WHILE DRIVING AND SOME WHEN I FIRST GET INTO THE CAR AND START IT. NOT ONLY DOES THE POWER STEERING GO OUT BUT THE CAR ALSO JERKS BACK AND FORTH WHILE IN MOTION, THE POWER STEERING MESSAGE FLASHES AND DINGS, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AND CAR HAS EVEN SHUT OFF IN TRAFFIC A FEW TIMES. GETTING TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE WHEN THE POWER STEERING GOES OUT, I TOOK IT FOR INSPECTION AT PEP BOYS MANY TIMES AND EVEN RECEIVED MY MONEY BACK WHEN THE PROBLEMS WERE NEVER ABLE TO BE FIXED. *TR",
