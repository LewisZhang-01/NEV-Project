THE SECOND TIME, A NOTE WAS ON THE RECEIPT NOTING A SERVICE BULLETIN BUT NOT WHAT IT SAID. BOTH TIMES, PAPERWORKS SAYS BUSHINGS WERE REPLACED. NOT VERY HAPPY WITH THE IDEA OF OWNING A CAR THAT HAS DRIVER SEAT BUSHINGS REQUIRING REPLACEMENT EVERY 10,000 MILES AFTER THE WARRANTY RUNS OUT. I NOTICE THIS PROBLEM NOTED IN SERVICE BULLETIN 01057 OF THIS SITE.",
