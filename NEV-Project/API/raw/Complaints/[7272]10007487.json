I'VE HAD TO DRIVE HOME IN THE RAIN WITH VERY LITTLE VISIBILITY BECAUSE OF THIS. CHEVROLET DID A RECALL FOR THIS IN 1998 FOR A LIMITED NUMBER OF VIN'S. THERE ARE APPARENTLY MANY MORE PROBLEMS THAN JUST WHAT THEY RECALLED IN 1998. THE INTERNET HAS HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS FROM VARIOUS CHEVY TRUCK OWNERS IN RECENT YEARS. THIS IS CLEARLY A SAFETY ISSUE AND A FURTHER RECALL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BECAUSE OF THE ABRUPT WAY THE PROBLEM SHOWS UP. YOU DON'T KNOW YOU HAVE A PROBLEM UNTIL IT IS RAINING AND YOU TRY TO USE THE WIPERS AND THEY DON'T WORK.  *PH    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**768333",
