        "summary": "I HAVE A 1999 DODGE TRUCK WITH CUMMINS DIESEL.  I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT A INCIDENT THAT PROMPTED A CONCERN FOR MYSELF AND MY FAMILY.  AS I WAS ON VACATION WITH MY FAMILY, WE WERE TRAVELING TO ST. LOUIS FOR A WEEKEND RACE.  WHILE TRAVELING UP A LONG HILL, MY TRUCK BEGAN TO LOOSE POWER.  THIS GRADE WAS A TWO LANE HIGHWAY, THAT WAS MODERATELY CURVY.  FUEL PRESSURE WAS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY AS INDICATED BY MY ADDED GAUGE.  UPON ARRIVAL TO OUR DESTINATION, I REPLACED THE FACTORY LIFT PUMP (FUEL TRANSFER PUMP) AND IMMEDIATELY NOTICED A LARGE DIFFERENCE IN POWER.  HAD THE TRUCK ACTUALLY DIED DURING THIS INCIDENT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO RESTART, THUS LEAVING A TWO LANE HIGHWAY BLOCKED ON A HILL IN CURVES.  THIS CAUSED MAJOR CONCERN AS IT IS A HIGH TRAFFIC AREA AND MANY TRACTOR-TRAILERS USE THIS BUSY STRETCH OF HIGHWAY.  THE MAIN CAUSE OF FAILURE FOR THESE PUMPS IS AN INCORRECT APPLICATION AS DESCRIBED BY THE PUMP MANUFACTURER.  DIAMLER-CHRYSLER IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, BUT HAS CHOSEN NOT TO ADDRESS THE CONCERN.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME IN THIS MATTER.   *NLM",
