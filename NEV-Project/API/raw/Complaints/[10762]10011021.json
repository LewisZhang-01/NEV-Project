BOTH HEADLIGHT COVERS FELL OFF THE CAR WITHIN WEEKS OF EACH OTHER.  I BELIEVE THE PART - AND MORE SPECIFICALLY THE GLUE HOLDING THE COVER ON - IS DEFECTIVE.  I WOULD LLIKE MY $226.09 REIMBURSED FOR THE PARTS AND LABOR REQUIRED TO FIX THE CAR.  I COULD UNDERSTAND IF ONE COVER FELL OFF, I MIGHT THEN BE ABLE TO ATTRIBUTE THIS TO A DEFECT (1 IN 10,000 OR 1 IN 100,000), BUT FOR BOTH TO FALL OFF IN A MATTER OF WEEKS - THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.  AGAIN, THE CAR WAS NOT IN AN ACCIDENT, NO FORCE WAS APPLIED TO THE HEADLIGHTS - THE COVERS SIMPLY \"POPPED\" OFF THE CAR.",
