THE DEALER HAS SEEN THE ISSUE AND IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM WITH MY CAR AND WITH OTHERS IN THE AREA.  SATURN CORPORATE CLAIMS THIS TO BE NORMAL AND HAS NO INTENTIONS OF SEEKING A FIX.  I WILL CHECK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, I BELIEVE IT'S ILLEGAL TO DRIVE A CAR IN THIS CONDITION.  THIS IS NOT A MERE DIMMING OF THE LIGHTS, THEY GO OFF COMPLETELY FOR A SECOND AND THEN COME BACK ON.  THIS IS NOT NORMAL FOR ANY CAR AND HAPPENS WHEN I'M JUST DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD.  I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING WITH ANY OTHER ELECTRONICS IN THE CAR WHEN IT HAPPENS.  I'M HOPEFUL THAT A FIX WILL BE FOUND OR THEY TAKE THE CAR BACK.",
