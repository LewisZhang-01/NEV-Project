TOWED TO CHEVEROLET DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIRS. FUEL PUMP SENDING UNIT CONNECTION INSIDE THE TANK WAS BURNED OUT.

HE RETURNED THE DEFECTIVE SENDING UNIT TO ME AND I COULD PLAINLY SEE THE BURNED ELECTRICAL CONNECTION AT THE TOP OF THE UNIT.  UNDER THE RIGHT CONDITIONS AN EXPLOSION WOULD BE POSSIBLE IF SUFFICIENT OXYGEN WAS IN THE TANK. FUEL PUMP AND COMPONENT PARTS SHOULD LAST LONGER THAN 46,000 MILES.",
