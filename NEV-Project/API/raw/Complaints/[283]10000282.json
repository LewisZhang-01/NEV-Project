I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT DRIVERS WITH THEIR HIGH BEAMS ON, I'M REFERRING TO REGULAR HEADLIGHTS THAT ARE UNUSUALLY BRIGHT.  I WAS ALMOST IN AN ACCIDENT ON THE 405 FREEWAY LAST NIGHT BECAUSE A DRIVER BEHIND ME WITH BRIGHT HEADLIGHTS BLINDED ME AND I VEERED INTO THE NEXT LANE BECAUSE WE WERE ON A CURVE AND I COULDN'T SEE WELL ENOUGH TO STAY IN MY LANE.  I HAVE HEARD MANY OF MY FRIENDS COMPALIN ABOUT CARS WITH BRIGHT HEADLIGHTS ALMOST CAUSING ACCIDENTS FOR THEM BECAUSE THE LIGHT CAN BE BLINDING, SIMILAR TO A FLASH BULB ON A CAMERA GOING OFF IN YOUR FACE IN A DARK ROOM.   THESE BRIGHT LIGHTS SHOULD NOT BE LEGAL FOR REGULAR DRIVING USE, THEY SHOULD BE USED ONLY IN THE SAME CONDITIONS THAT HIGH BEAMS ARE USED.",
