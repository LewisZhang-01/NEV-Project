COMPLETE LOSS OF RADIO AND IDRIVE FUNCTIONALITY. MODULE IS LOCATED IN TRUNK UNDER THE SPARE TIRE. NOTIFIED BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, AND THEY JUST SAID THAT THE CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND NOTHING COULD BE DONE. I FEEL THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS DEFECT THAT COULD POSSIBLY START A FIRE. SEVERAL BMW ONLINE FORUMS HAVE DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE. OTHERS HAVE REMEDIED THE PROBLEM BY RELOCATING THE MODULE TO A HIGHER PLACE IN THE TRUNK. MOST OF WHO OWN THESE CARS DO NOT KNOW THAT THESE VEHICLES HAVE THIS VULNERABILITY. VEHICLE WAS MOVING IN THE EARLY MORNING WHEN THIS HAPPENED.",
