FIRST SAYING IT NEVER HAD ONE, THEN IT WAS MISSING, THEN IT DIDN'T COME IN THE KIT, I FILED A CASE WITH TOYOTA USA, CORPORATION # 1701033889 AS PER ALL SAFETY ITEMS WERE TO BE MAINTAINED OR REPLACED  !! BUT I WAS DENIED BY TOYOTA CORP. SO I WILL HAVE TO PICK UP MY TRUCK UNDER PROTEST AS TOYOTA OF BEDFORD IS THREATENING ME WITH CALLING THE LOANER CAR IN AS STOLEN IF I DON'T TODAY !  SAID SHIELD WAS \"RUSTY\" BUT MOST WAS ON THE TRUCK WHEN IT WENT IN THERE, AND IM ON SOCIAL SECURITY (SMALL CHECK) WHICH  OUR GREAT OBAMA CARE TAKES ALMOST FIVE EIGHTS OF & I REALLY CANT AFFORD THE $ 640.- THEY ARE ASKING JUST FOR THE PART ! I REALLY DON'T FEEL SAFE IN THE TRUCK WITHOUT THE SHIELD , SO IT WILL PROBABLY SIT TILL BETTER WEATHER & I CAN MAKE A SHIELD FOR IT..AND IT WILL BE STRONGER & LAST MUCH LONGER THAN THE PIECE OF \"RUSTY TIN, \" THAT THEY SAY FELL AWAY. SO AGAIN , IM PICKING IT UP UNDER PROTEST & WILL WRITE THAT ON THE BILLING STATEMENT TODAY 1/52017...
