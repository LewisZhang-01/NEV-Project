VEHICLE HAD NO MORE PROBLEM WITH FUEL GAUGE.  SEVERAL WEEKS LATER THE CHECK GAUGES AND THE OIL GAUGES DID SAME THING.  TOOK TO DEALER AND THEY STATED IT MAY BE OIL PUMP.  AFTER REMOVING OIL PAN, DEALER STATED TO MUCH SLUDGE IN PAN AND HAD EXTENDED WARRANTY SEND AN ADJUSTER TO CHECK OUT.  DEALER THEN TOOK ENGINE APART TO FIND THAT SLUDGE WAS THROUGH OUT THE ENGINE BUT NO DAMAGE TO BEARINGS OR VITAL PARTS.  WARRANTY COMPANY \"WESTERN DIVERSIFIED\" DECLINED REPAIR STATING THAT TO INFREQUENT OIL CHANGES.  WARRANTY STATED THAT EVEN WITH PROOF OF OIL CHANGES THAT THIS IS AN OIL BREAKDOWN PROBLEM AND NOT THEIR PROBLEM.  DEALER STATED NOW THAT IT WAS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND WANTED US TO PAY FOR A NEW ENGINE.  CONSUMER REFUSED AND FORTUNATELY GOT TO TRADE IN VEHICLE TOWARDS PURCHASE OF A NEW ONE.  ONLY AFTER REVIEWING NHTSA WEBSITE DID WE REALIZE THAT WE WERE IN A NO WIN SITUATION AND LUCKILY GOT OUT FROM UNDER THE VEHICLE.  THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT DODGE OBVIOUSLY KNOWS ABOUT, I AM WAITING FOR THIS COMPANY TO DO THE RIGHT THING.  WE HAVE SHOWN OUR COMMITMENT TO THE COMPANY BY BUYING SEVERAL VEHICLES THE LEAST THEY COULD DO IS PAY US THE SAME RESPECT!!!!!!!!",
