THEY WILL ENGAGE AFTER A FEW SECONDS OF APPLIED PRESSURE BUT BY THEN I AM ALREADY THROUGH THE INTERSECTION AND HAVE NEARLY BEEN HIT/HAVE HIT ANOTHER CAR DUE TO THIS. ALSO, I WAS INVOLVED IN AN AUTO ACCIDENT WHERE I HAD TO BRAKE HARD, BUT WHEN I DID THE TRUCK PULLED LEFT AND REAR-ENDED THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME. AT THE TIME I DIDN'T QUESTION THE BRAKES BUT NOW I HAVE HAD CONSTANT NOISES AND CLICKS FROM THE FRONT BRAKES AND CAN PUSH THE PEDAL TO THE FLOOR, AND WHEN I DO THERE IS A LOUD CLICK. I HAVE READ 11 SIMILAR COMPLAINTS AND WONDER IF THERE IS A MAJOR PROBLEM THE PUBLIC SHOULD KNOW ABOUT. IF THE BRAKES WERE A CAUSE OF MY ACCIDENT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.",
