        "summary": "I BEGAN MERGING ONTO I 820 WHEN MY VEHICLE (BY ITSELF) FLOORED THE ACCELERATOR. I TRIED PRESSING THE BRAKE (IT WOULDNT PRESS DOWN, IT WAS HARD AS A ROCK). I USED BOTH FEET TO NO AVAIL. AT 75-80 MPH I JAMMED IT INTO NEUTRAL. THE RPM'S WERE STILL AT MAX. BY THIS TIME IT HAD SLOWED (I WAS ON THE SHOULDER OF THE HIWAY) TO ABOUT 20 MPH, THEN JAMMED IT IN PARK. I LOOKED AT THE INSTRUMENT PANEL AND ALL THE INSTRUMENTS WERE ON 0. I HESITATED THEN GAVE THE CAR SOME GAS, IT WAS STILL RUNNING! I COULDNT EVEN HEAR THE ENGINE UNTIL I REVVED IT. I PROCEEDED TO TURN OFF THE IGNITION. THE CAR DID TURN OFF.       I NOTICED A 17 YR OLD BOY DYING BACK IN 2012 -13 FROM THE SAME ACT MY CAR DID. ITS BAD ENOUGH TO LOSE A CHILD BUT TO LOSE A CHILD BECAUSE OF A MALFUNCTION FROM A VEHICLE AND THE COMPANY STATING THEY WILL HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT FURTHER,  IS NOTHING SHORT OF TOTAL NEGLIGENCE AND REFUSAL TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONES ERROR AND WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OUR YOUTH? LOOK WHO'S RAISING THEM AND GIVING THEM EXCUSES.",
