        "summary": "UPON DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS OF 70-80 MPH, MY VAN LOST POWER SUDDENLY. I WAS UNABLE TO STEER BECAUSE THE ENGINE CUT OFF. IT WAS A RAPID SPEED DECREASE, I WATCHED THE TACHOMETER DROP IN SPEED. I WAS IN THE FAST LANE AND AT A DEAD STOP. A FEW MINUTES LATER I WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE VAN AND PULL TO THE LEFT SHOULDER OF THE FREEWAY. I TOOK IT TO A CHRYSLER DEALER AND THEY PULLED 2 CODES FROM THE VAN'S ONBOARD COMPUTER. HOWEVER, THEY TELL ME THAT THEY CANNOT PINPOINT THE PROBLEM WITHOUT IT OCCURRING AGAIN. THE SAME THING HAPPEN 3 YEARS AGO, AGAIN I WAS ON A ROAD TRIP TRAVELING 70-80 MPH IN HOT WEATHER AND THE VAN LOST POWER. UPON REACHING MY DESTINATION, I TOOK THE VAN TO A CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP, WHICH AT THAT TIME, COULD NOT PULL ANY CODES. AFTER LEAVING THE VAN FOR A WEEK, I DROVE IT BACK HOME. THE VAN STOPPED TWICE, HOME IS 400 MILES FROM MY DESTINATION. WHEN I ARRIVED HOME, I TOOK THE VAN TO A LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALER, AND THEY PULLED A CODE THAT INDICATED A MISFIRE IN CYLINDER #5. THEY CLEARED THE CODE (DON'T KNOW WHY...), AND THEY TRIED TO DUPLICATE THE CODE. THEY COULD NOT.... THE DEALER CHARGED ME $50 AND TOLD ME THAT SINCE THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE ERROR CODE THE CAR SHOULD BE FINE TO DRIVE AGAIN. NOW, IT HAPPENS AGAIN IN THE YEAR 2003... VERY CONCERNED.  *NLM",
