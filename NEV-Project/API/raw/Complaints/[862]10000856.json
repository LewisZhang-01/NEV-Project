THE 02 HAS HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE FRONT END PULLING AND SHACKING SINCE THE DAY RECEIVED THE TRUCK IT HAS BEEN IN FOR SERVICE 5 TIMES SINCE AUGUST 5TH 2002. IT ALSO HAS PROBLEMS WITH THE ENGINE IDLE ALLWAYS DROPPING BELOW 500 RPMS AND TRYING TO STALL ALONG WITH VERY HARD DOWNSHIFTING WHEN COMING TO A STOP. THE DEALERS ALLWAYS SAY UNABLE TO DUPLICATE PROBLEM EVEN THOUGH IT HAPPENS ON MY WAY HOME FROM THE DEALER IT IS VERY FRUSTARTING TO DROP OFF THE TRUCK FOR DAYS AT A TIME ONCE OR TWICE A MONTH AND THEN BE TOLD UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND GET IN THE TRUCK AND IT HAPPEN BUT THE DEALERS CLAIM THEY DONT FEEL THE PROBLEM OR CAN'T FIND THE PROBLEM. THE TSB'S FOR THE ENGINE IDLE HAVE BEEN PERFORMED AND ALL IT DID WAS MAKE IT NO STALL OUT COMPLETLY ONLY IDLE WAY DOWN AND ALSO MY GAS MILAGE AND THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE TO GO DOWN. I HAVE REQUESTED DODGE BUY THIS THING THEY CALL THE MAYOR BACK ON NOV 15TH 02 AND THEY HAVE NOT RESPONDED. WHAT CAN I DO NOW DAIMLER IS JUST IGNORING MY PROBLEMS WITH THIS TRUCK. I BUILT A ANTI DODGE WEBSITE TRYING TO GET THERE ATTENTION AS TO HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE HAVING THESE TROUBLE AS WELL AND I HAVE POSTED EMAILS AND STORIES FROM THEM ON THE WEB SITE.",
