        "summary": "MILEAGE 65,000  MY WIFE AND 3 TODDLERS DROVE TO A TIRE STORE MONDAY MORNING (MARCH 5, 2009) TO PURCHASED TWO NEW TIRES FOR THE BACK. THE MECHANICS DROVE THE CAR ONTO THE HYDRAULIC JACKS AND AS SOON AS THE CAR WAS BEING LIFTED UP, THEY NOTICED RIGHT AWAY THAT THE REAR AXLE OF THE CAR WAS SPLITTING IN HALF... SO THEY TELL MY WIFE WHAT HAPPENED AND SHE CALLS ME UP. WELL I'M ROUGHLY 30 MILES AWAY, SO I HAD TO TAKE SOME TIME OFF AND DROVE MY LITTLE CAR TO THE PLACE AND COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. THE REAR AXLE WAS BROKEN WITH  INCH REMAINING ON THE TOP PORTION BEFORE IT COMPLETELY BROKE IN HALF. UNBELIEVABLE! THE BREAK WAS ABOUT 2 FEET FROM THE DRIVER'S SIDE REAR TIRE. HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GET IT FIXED SINCE IT WAS ALREADY BROKEN AND UP IN THE AIR.     THE NEXT DAY I CALLED FORD MOTOR COMPANY UP AND WILL DO NOTHING ABOUT IT. THE MECHANIC EVEN TOLD ME AND MY WIFE THAT HE WENT THROUGH 4 REAR AXLES ROUGHLY THE SAME AS MY VAN! AFTER HEARING OTHERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS, FORD MOTOR COMPANY SHOULD TELL THE PUBLIC AND HAVE THERE VANS CHECKED BEFORE SOMEONE OR FAMILY GETS KILLED OR SERIOUSLY INJURED!!    THE LORD WAS WITH US ON THAT DAY. WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THIS? *TR",
