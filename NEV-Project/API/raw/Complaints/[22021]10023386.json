THE DEALERSHIP NOTIFIED ME THAT THE ENGINE IS NO GOOD.  NOT ONLY DID THE ENGINE GO BAD, BUT WE'VE BEEN PUTTING OIL IN THE ENGINE LIKE MAD.  I THINK WE'VE PURCHASED 6 QUARTS OF OIL IN THE 8 MONTH PERIOD AND THERE IS NO LEAK AND ISUZU STATES THIS IS \"NORMAL\".  ALSO AT JUST OVER 30000 MILES THE ABS LIGHT CAME ON.  THE INTAKE GASKET HAD TO BE REPLACED 1 MONTH AFTER PURCHASE AND THAT IN TURN CAUSED ONE OF THE VALVES (EGR I THINK) TO NEED REPLACED AS WELL.    *NLM",
