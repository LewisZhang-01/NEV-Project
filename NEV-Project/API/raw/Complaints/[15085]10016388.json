AT THE START OF THE DESCEND WHEN CAR GAINED SPEED I INTENDED TO UPSHIFT FROM 3RD TO 4TH BUT SHIFTED TO 2ND INSTEAD. I SPUN OUT OF CONTROL AND FOUND THE CAR FACING WHERE I CAME FROM. THE ENGINE DIED AND WILL NOT RE-START. CAR WAS TOWED TO DEALER AND CLAIMED ENGINE WAS OVER REVVED AND BEYOND REPAIR. ACURA REFUSED TO REPAIR UNDER WARRANTY. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THE SHIFTING MECHANISM AS IT IS VERY EASY TO MISTAKENLY SHIFT TO 2ND GEAR WHEN ACCELERATING OR DRIVING DOWNHILL. LUCKY NOBODY HURT.    *JB",
