        "summary": "I BOUGHT A VW NEW BEETLE IN FEB 2001. AFTER A YEAR AND HALF, THE CAR BEGAN TO START ROUGHLY AND SHAKY, AND WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT FLASHING AT THE SAME TIME.  THIS PHENOMENON HAPPENED MORE REQUENTLY AND WAS GETTING WORSE LATER. THE CAR LOST MOST OF IT POWER WHILE DRIVING. SO I DROVE TO VW/AUDI BERNADI DEALER IN NATICK, MA IN SEPTEMBER 2002 TO HAVE IT FIXED. IT WAS FOUND OUT IT WAS CAUSED BY AN IGNITION COIL FAILURE AND IT IS A KNOWN DEFECT. THEY REPLACED THE BAD COIL BUT LEFT THE OTHER THREE UNTOUCHED.     I AM VERY WORRIED ABOUT THIS. I DRIVE THROUGH HIGHWAY TO MY OFFICE EVERYDAY. I DON'T WANT TO STUCK IN THE HIGHTWAY IN THE COLD WIND WAITING FOR A TOWL TRUCK. MY WARRANTY IS GOING TO EXPIRE SOON, AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE VW DEALER WILL FIX THE POSSIBLE NEXT FAILURE OF IGNITION COIL FREE OF CHARGE. SEEING AN ARTICLE FROM BOSTON GLOBE, I KNOW THAT I AM NOT ALONE. HTTP://WWW.BOSTON.COM/DAILYGLOBE2/026/AUTO/NO_EASY_FIX_FOR_FAILING_IGNITION_COILS_IN_AUDIS_VWS+.SHTML  WOULD YOU PLEASE ORDER VW TO RECALL ALL THE DEFECTIVE IGNITION COILS?  THANKS A LOT FOR YOUR TIME.",
