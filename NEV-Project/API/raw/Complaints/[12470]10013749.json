LAST SUMMER I NOTICED THE DRIVERS SIDE LENS WAS LOOSE SO I GLUED IT BACK ON WITH EPOXY.(COST $3.00) RECENTLY I FOUND OUT THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE LENS HAD FALLEN OUT SOMETIME WHILE DRIVING.(BOTH FELL OUT WITHIN 6 MONTHS OF EACH OTHER) I WENT TO WASH THE VAN AND THE HALOGEN BULB EXPLODED AND FLAMED WHEN IT GOT WET. HAD I BEEN CLOSER TO THE VEHICLE I COULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY FLYING GLASS. IF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED DURING A RAIN STORM I WOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVING WITHOUT HEADLIGHTS. (THE DEALERSHIP CHARGED ME $165 TO REPLACE ONE ASSEMBLY). THE SEALANT WAS FAULTY ON THE LAST ASSEMBLY, I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THE NEW ONE.     *NLM",
