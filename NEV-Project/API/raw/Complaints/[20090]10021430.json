LOOKING ON THE INTERNET I FOUND THIS IS A DESIGN PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL OF TRUCK AND A RECALL IS IN ORDER. THE BRAKE CALIPERS ARE UNDERSIZED. IT FEELS LIKE THE ROTORS ARE WARPED BUT THIS IS NOT THE PROBLEM. PLEASE ADVISE ME ON WHAT OPTIONS I HAVE. I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS DESIGN FLAW HAS CAUSED COMPLETE FAILURES RESULTING IN CRASHES.*AK",
