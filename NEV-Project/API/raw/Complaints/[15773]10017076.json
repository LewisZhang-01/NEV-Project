        "summary": "I PURCHASED A NEW 2000 HYUNDAI SONATA GLS FROM SCHAUMBURG HYUNDAI (IL) IN NOVEMBER 2000, AND HAD EXISTING DAMAGE OR TRAFFIC CRASHES WITH THE VEHICLE UNTIL ON 10/07/2002, WHEN I WAS FORCED OFF THE ROADWAY BY A TRUCK AND STRUCK THE SIDE OF A ROCKY MOUNTAIN HEAD-ON. THE FORCE WAS ENOUGH TO BEND THE MIDDLE OF THE CAR'S FRAME AND TOTAL THE CAR. I WAS THRUST VIOLENTLY FORWARD AT IMPACT, AND SUFFERED MINOR NECK AND BACK INJURIES, AND HAD BEEN PROPERLY USING THE SEATBELT. HOWEVER, NONE OF THE CAR'S FRONT OR SIDE AIR BAGS DEFLATED AT TIME OF IMPACT. THIS CONCERNS ME GREATLY SINCE I AM A POLICE OFFICER AND AWARE OF PRODUCT DEFECTS, AND RECALLS WHICH EFFECT PUBLIC SAFETY. I BROUGHT THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE SCHAUMBURG HYUNDAI DEALER AND ALSO HYUNDAI MOTOR FINANCE, NEITHER OF WHICH RESPONDED FAVORABLY TO THIS CONCERN. I GUESS IT MUST ACTUALLY TAKE A DEATH TO GET THEIR PROPER ATTENTION! I CHECKED THE NHTSA WEBSITE AND REGRETABLLY LOCATED SIMILAR COMPLAINTS BY OTHER CONSUMERS.",
