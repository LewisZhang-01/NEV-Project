        "summary": "MY 2000 DODGE CARAVAN WITH ONLY 29,450 MILES DEVELOPED A SEVERE VIBRATION IN THE STEERING WHEEL ACCOMPANIED BY A DISCONCERTING NOISE WHEN BRAKING.  PRIOR TO THE VIBRATION DEVELOPING, I NOTICED THE BRAKING POWER HAD DIMINISHED.  UPON INVESTIGATION, I FOUND THE BRAKE FLUID WAS BELOW THE MINIMUM LEVEL AND HAD TO ADD FLUID. THIS IMPROVED THE BRAKE PEDAL PERFORMANCE BUT THE STOPPING POWER WAS STILL SUBPAR. ALSO, WHENEVER I WASH THE VEHICLE THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BLACK BRAKE DUST ON AND AROUND THE FRONT WHEELS WHICH RAISES ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS FOR ME.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER WHO FOUND THE FRONT BRAKE PADS WERE WORN OUT AND THE FRONT ROTORS WERE RUSTED, PITTED, AND SLIGHTLY WARPED. EVEN THOUGH THE CAR IS ONLY 2 1/2 YEARS OLD AND HAD ONLY 29,450 MILES, DAIMLER CHRYSLER REFUSED ANY WARRANTY CONSIDERATION ON THE BRAKES.  I HAD TO PAY NEARLY $300 FOR REPAIRS. WHEN I CALLED THE DAIMLER CHRYSLER CONSUMER HOTLINE, I WAS GIVEN THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS CONDITION WAS CONSIDERED \"NORMAL.\"   THE MINIVAN IS DRIVEN GENTLY WITH ABOUT 70% OF THE MILEAGE BEING IN-TOWN DRIVING AND ABOUT 30% HIGHWAY DRIVING.  ON PREVIOUS VEHICLES I HAVE OWNED, THE AVERAGE LIFE OF FRONT BRAKES HAS BEEN ABOUT 85,000 MILES.   NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY MY FAMILY IN THE VEHICLE IF THE BRAKES ARE DESIGNED WITH SUCH POOR DURABILITY.    *NLM",
