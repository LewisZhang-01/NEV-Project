        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING MY FOREST RIVER INC. REFLECTIONS MOTORCOACH AT NIGHT IN IDAHO, I LOST ALL OF MY DASH LIGHTS, SWITCHES ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF DASH QUIT AND THE HEADLIGHTS WENT OUT.  AT OTHER TIMES I HAVE LOST THE TAILLIGHTS,BRAKE LIGHTS.  THE HEAD LIGHTS WOULD NOT STAY ADJUSTED AND THIS WAS KNOWN BEFORE THE COACH LEFT THE PLANT BECAUSE OF A POOR DESIGN IN THE BRACKETS.  THE AIR BRAKES COULD ONLY BE DRAINED OF MOISTURE BY CRAWLING UNDER THE COACH AS THE CABLES ATTACHED TO THE VALVES WERE NEVER BROUGHT TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE COACH.  THE STEP COVER FAILED SO THE STEPS LEADING OUTSIDE THE COACH COULD NOT BE COVERED WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL PROBLEMS.  THESE STEPS WERE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE PASSENGER SEAT.  THE SLIDE OUT ROOM HYDRAULIC SYSTEM FAILED AND THE EMERGENCY PROCEDURES FOR RETRACTING THE ROOM WERE NOT PROPER REQUIRING THE COACH TO BE DRIVEN OVER 50 MILES WITH THE ROOM EXTENDED APPROXIMATELY 18 INCHES OUTSIDE THE COACH.  THIS COACH WAS DETERMINED TO BE A LEMON BY THE COURT IN OREGON.  THE DATE BELOW IS THE DAY THE PROBLEMS STARTED AND THIS COACH HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE SHOP ON A CONSISTENT BASIS SINCE THAT TIME FOR NUMEROUS OTHER FAILURES.   *NLM",
