        "summary": "I HAVE A 1999 DODGE INTREPID, 2.7 LITER ENGINE, 65000 MILES ON VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN PROPERLY MAINTAINED.  TIMING BELT BROKE ON VEHICLE AND IT WAS TOWED TO A CHRYSLER/DODGE DEALER FOR REPAIRS.  MECHANIC BEGAN TO DISASSEMBLE MOTOR AND FOUND A BLACK SLUDGE INSIDE ENGINE - SAID IT LOOKED AS IF THE MOTOR OIL HAD NEVER BEEN CHANGED.  THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN PROPERLY MAINTAINED.  I WAS THEN INFORMED THE MOTOR WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED.       I HAVE CONTACTED SEVERAL MECHANICS FOR REPAIR ESTIMATES - WHICH RANGE FROM $4500.00-$7000.00.  ONE PERSON I SPOKE WITH SAID THAT A \"JASPER\" REPLACEMENT MOTOR WAS AVAILABLE THAT HAS FIXED THE DESIGN PROBLEM WITH THE OIL.  I AM TRYING TO FIND INFORMATION REGARDING THIS MOTOR.  FROM THE WEBSITE I WAS REVIEWING, INTREPID.CLAN-510.ORG  THIS SLUDGE IS A PROBLEM NOT TYPICALLY ENCOUNTERED, BUT IT SEEMS TO BE MORE COMMON WITH THE INTREPID.        ANOTHER MOTOR REPLACEMENT BUSINESS, I CONTACTED, SAID THEY WERE GETTING REQUESTS FOR THE 2.7 LITER MOTOR EVERY DAY AND SAID REPAIRS WOULD BE $7000.00.       DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MOTOR?  CAN YOU PROVIDE ME WITH CONTACT INFORMATION? *JB",
