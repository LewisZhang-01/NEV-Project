EACH OF THESE TIRES EXHIBITS A CONTINUOUS FISSURE AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE TIRE WHERE THE TREAD MEETS THE SIDEWALL.  I REPLACED THESE TIRES IMMEDIATELY AND HAVE RETAINED THEM HERE AT MY HOME SO THAT I MAY BRING THEM TO THE NHTSA FACILITY HERE RETAINED THEM HERE AT MY HOME SO THAT I MAY BRING THEM TO THE NHTSA FACILITY HERE IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA.  I BELIEVE THESE TIRES WERE IN IMMEDIATE DANGER OF CATASTROPHIC FAILURE IN A FASHION SIMILAR TO THE RECALLED TIRES.  I WOULD LIKE THE NHTSA TO EXTEND THE RECALL O THE WILDERNESS AT TIRES TO INCLUDE ALL TIRES MANUFACTURED IN ALL PLANTS AND AM WILLING TO PROVIDE THE PROOF NEEDED TO JUSTIFY THIS RECALL.  PLEASE CONTACT ME AT MY HOME PHONE IMMEDIATELY. THANK YOU.  *AK  *SCC    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*734318",
