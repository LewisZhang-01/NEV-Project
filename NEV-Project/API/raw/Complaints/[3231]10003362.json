THE CAR IS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE AND HAS AN OIL CHANGE EVEY 3,000 MILES. I HAD JUST HAD AN OIL CHANGE APPROX 1,000 MILES BEFORE THIS HAPPENED. I CALLED DAIMERCHRYSLER AND ASKED THEM IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT THEY COULD ASSIST WITH ETC?  THEY ASKED IF THE DEALER HAD TORN DOWN THE ENGINE.  I TOLD THEM THAT I HAD A PRIVATE DIAGNOSIS AND THE DEALER HAD A TECH LISTEN TO IT AND SAID THEY WERE SURE A ROD HAD GONE BAD.  THEY SAAD TO HAVE THE DEALER TEAR IT DOWN ... THEY THEN TRIED TO BLAME ME FOR NOT GETTING THE OIL CHANGED ON A REGULAR BASIS.  I AGAIN TOLD THEM THAT IT HAD BEEN CHANGED EVERY 3,000 MILES AND THAT I OWN TWO OTHER CARS (95 SILLOUTTTE & 97 CUTLASS) THAT HAVE 130,000+ MILES ON THEM.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND PAID THEM 250.00 FOR A TEARDOWN.  THE DEALER (GENESEE VALLEY DODGE IN FLINT, MI) CALLED ME AND TERRY SCHEFKE (SERVICE MANAGER) CALLED TO SAY THAT IT HAD INDEED THROWN A ROD AND THAT I WOULD NEED A NEW SHORT BLOCK AT A COST OF $4.250.00.  I AGAIN CONTACTED DODGE BY PHONE AND EMAIL.  THEY SAID THAT IT WAS MY PROBLEM BECAUSE IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY (3/36).  I ASKED THEM IF AN ENGINE FAILURE WAS NORMAL AT 55K?  THE DEALER HAD HIS DISTRICT MANAGER LOOK AT THE CAR AND I WAS DENIED ANY ASSISTANCE OR COMPENSATION.   I FEEL THAT THE ENGINE FAILURE WAS NOT AT ALL MY FAULT,  I NEVER DID GET A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT OR ANY OTHER WARNING UNTI I EXITED THE EXPRESSWAY (I DO NOT SPEED AND HAVE NEVER HAD A SPEEDING TICKET IN 25 YEARS OF DRIVING)   TO MAKE MATTER WORSE I HAVE TO HAVE THE DEALER REAPIR THE ENGINE BECAUSE MY LEASE IS UP OMN 3/3/03.  I HAVE BEEN ONLINE RESEARCHING THE 2.7 DOHC ENGINE AND LOCATED YOU FROM WWW.INTREPIDCLAN-510.ORG.  THERE SEEMS TO BE AN ABUNDACE OF SIMULAR COMPLTE ENGINE FAILURES ON VAROIUS WEB SITES.  BASICALLY I AM LOOKING FOR ANYONE WHO COULD POSSIBLY HELP?",
