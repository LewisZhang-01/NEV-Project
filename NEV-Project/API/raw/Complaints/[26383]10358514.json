THE BRAKE LINES WERE RUSTED AND CORRODED ON THE OUTSIDE.  I WILL BE REPLACING THEM.   I HAVE ONLY 70,000 MILES ON IT.   I HAVE OWNED NUMEROUS VEHICLES AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME  I HAVE EXPERIENCED RUSTED BRAKE LINES.  ABOUT 5 MONTHS AGO I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM BUT ON A DIFFERENT BRAKE LINE ON THE REAR, THANK HEAVEN FOR SECONDARY BACKUP LINES. *TR",
