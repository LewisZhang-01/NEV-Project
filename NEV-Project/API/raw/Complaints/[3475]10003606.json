        "summary": "MY 1999 CHRYSLER CONCORDE WITH 46,000 MILES ON IT DEVELOPED SLUDGE IN THE ENGINE CAUSING THE TIMING CHAIN TO COME OFF ITS TRACK AND SUBSEQUENTLY DAMAGING  OTHER PARTS OF THE ENGINE.   THE DEALER SAYS THE ENGINE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $8,000.   WHEN I ASKED WHAT CAUSED THE SLUDGE, THE DEALER TOLD ME I DIDN'T HAVE THE OIL CHANGED ENOUGH.  WHEN I PRODUCED DOCUMENTS TO THE CONTRARY, THE DEALER TOLD ME THE OIL USED MUST HAVE BEEN BAD AND BROKE DOWN.   I FIND THIS HIGHLY UNLIKELY.   TO DATE, I HAVE NOT GOTTEN SATISFACTION FROM THE DEALER OR CHRYSLER.   I AM AWARE OF OTHERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  SEVERAL OF THESE PEOPLE WERE ALSO TOLD THE SAME THING BY THEIR DEALERS.  IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S A CANNED ROUTINE TO DEFLECT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PROBLEM ONTO SOMEONE ELSE.   I BELIEVE CHRYSLER IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND IS NOT STANDING BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT.  CAN ANYTHING BE DONE?",
