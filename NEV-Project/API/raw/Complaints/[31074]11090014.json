WELL, I HAD BOTH THE INFLATORS REPLACED IN 2016. SO NOW I GOT ANOTHER RECALL NOTICE THAT I HAVE TO HAVE BOTH THOSE INFLATORS REPLACED AGAIN. SO EVEN AFTER I HAD THOSE INFLATORS REPLACED TWO YEARS AGO, I NEED TO HAVE THEM REPLACED AGAIN. DID THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE INFLATORS WITH TWO MORE DEFECTIVE INFLATORS? HAVE I BEEN DRIVING AROUND, STILL, WITH INFLATORS THAT COULD KILL ME? NOBODY SEEMS TO HAVE AN ANSWER. ALSO, WHY WAS THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY ALLOWED TO REPLACE BAD INFLATORS WITH BAD INFLATORS? THE NEW RECALL FROM FORD TELLS ME THAT PARTS ARE AVAILABLE, YET, THEY HAVE NO PARTS.(I SAW MY DEALER YESTERDAY) SO NOW I AM STILL DRIVING AROUND IN A VEHICLE THAT COULD POSSIBLY KILL ME WITH A DEVICE THAT WAS MEANT TO SAVE ME. I DON'T HAVE THE CHOICE OF JUST PARKING MY TRUCK UNTIL FORD FEELS LIKE GETTING THE PARTS. AND LASTLY, SINCE FORD PUT BAD INFLATORS IN MY RANGER TWO YEARS AGO, HOW DO I KNOW THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DO THE SAME THING AGAIN ONCE T MY DEALER GETS THE PARTS? PLEASE, ANY HELP ON YOUR PART WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.",
