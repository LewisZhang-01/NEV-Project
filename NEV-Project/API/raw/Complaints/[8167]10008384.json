NO SOLUTION TOYOTA DID NOTHING. BRAKES MAKE GRINDING NOISE LIKE GRAVEL. ALSO THE VSC SYSTEM ENGAGES AND DOES NOT TAKE POWER FROM DRIVE TRAIN, RESULT IN VERY LOUD METAL SHEARING NOISES FROM UNDERCARRIAGE. TOYOTA IS SAYING THIS IS NORMAL. TOYOTA IS ADVISING THE AVG LIFE OF BRAKES ON THIS CAR IS APPROX 20000 MILES THERE IS A MAJOR DESIGN ERROR BETWEEN THE VCS AND THE ABS BRAKE SYSTEM RESULTING POOR BRAKE LIFE AND THIS CAN NOT BE A SAFE SITUATION WHEN VSC DOES NOT RELEASE POWER TO BRAKES WHEN IT ACTIVATES. VCS ALSO ACTIVATES AT DROP OF A HAT. GENERAL BRAKE DESIGN MUST HAVE MAJOR DESIGN FLAW IF AVG LIFE IS ONLY 20000 MILES.  *NLM",
