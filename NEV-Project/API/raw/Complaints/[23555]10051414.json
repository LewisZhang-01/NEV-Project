THE BRAKES CAME ON VERY HARD AND UNEXPECTEDLY. THE PROBLEM CONTINUED WHILE DRIVING HOME THROUGH RESIDENTIAL AREAS. I SHUT CAR OFF AT HOME THEN TOOK IT OUT AGAIN AND THE ABS ACTIVATED HARD AND UNEXPECTEDLY AT EVERY STOP.  I LET THE CAR SIT THE NEXT DAY, SUNDAY, AND TOOK IT IN TO DEALER MONDAY. ON THE WAY TO THE DEALER, THE BRAKES OPERATED NORMALLY. THEY COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM. I'VE HAD CARS WITH ABS FOR THE PAST 8 YEARS AND NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS BEFORE. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THIS HAPPENING AGAIN IN HEAVY TRAFFIC AND  CAUSING LOSS OF CONTROL.",
