        "summary": "THE INSTRUMENT PANEL CLUSTER (INCLUDING THE SPEEDOMETER AND TACHOMETER) ON MY 2004 CHEVROLET SILVERADO STICKS.  I FIRST NOTICED THE PROBLEM IN APRIL 2006 WHEN THE SPEEDOMETER STUCK.  I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE AND PASSING PEOPLE VERY EASILY, YET MY SPEEDOMETER SAID I WAS DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 35 MPH.  THE PROBLEM HAS PROGRESSED SINCE THAT TIME AND THE SPEEDOMETER WORKS ONLY INFREQUENTLY AT THIS TIME.  OVER THE PAST 21 MONTHS, I HAVE USED THE TACHOMETER TO DETERMINE MY APPROXIMATE SPEED, YET IT BEGAN STICKING IN JANUARY 2008.  I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM GM IN DECEMBER 2007 \"NOTIFYING\" ME OF THIS POTENTIAL DEFECT, AND EXTENDING THE WARRANTY ON THIS PART TO SEVEN YEARS OR 70,000 MILES.  I, HOWEVER, HAVE APPROXIMATELY 95,000 MILES ON MY VEHICLE AS OF JANUARY 7, 2008.  CHEVROLET AND GM APPEAR UNWILLING AT THIS TIME TO ISSUE A RECALL FOR THIS SIGNIFICANT SAFETY HAZARD, AND THEY APPEAR UNWILLING TO WORK WITH ME BECAUSE I APPARENTLY DRIVE TOO MUCH.  I WAS FORCED TO PURCHASE THE NEW INSTRUMENT PANEL AND PAY FOR THE COST OF THE PART AND LABOR IN SPITE OF GM'S ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE SAFETY HAZARD APPARENTLY COMMON TO 2004 SILVERADOS.  TO BE HONEST, THE INSTRUMENT PANEL (NOTABLY THE SPEEDOMETER) HAS FAILED MORE TIMES THAN I CARE TO COUNT.  *TR",
