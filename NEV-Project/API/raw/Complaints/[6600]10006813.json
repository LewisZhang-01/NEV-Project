I DROVE STRAIGHT HOME AND THE MILEAGE SHOWED 265 MILES, TWICE THE MILEAGE. ALSO, THE CAR SHAKES AND GRINDS WHEN STARTING.   THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. THAT WAS WHEN IT HAD LESS THAN 1000 MILES. FUEL LINES OR SOMETHING SMELLS HEAVY WITH GAS. MY CAR EATS GAS MORE THAN MY ASTRO VAN. THEY SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG. I HAVE PUT THREE COOLING SYSTEMS IN THIS CAR THEY SAID WAS WRONG. FUSES KEEP BURNING OUT. I HAVE REPLACED 65 BULBS, THEY SAID NOTHING IS WRONG. IT'S MUCH WORSE NOW. WHEN I TURN THE CAR THE STEERING STICKS THEN GOES INTO THE TURN, THEY SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG. THIS CAR HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT TROUBLE SINCE I BOUGHT IT.
