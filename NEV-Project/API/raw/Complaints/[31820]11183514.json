        "summary": "WE PURCHASED BRAND NEW A 2016 KIA SEDONA FROM THE DEALERSHIP. WITHIN THE 2 YEARS WE OWNED IT WE HAD TO TAKE IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP FOUR TIMES BECAUSE THE AIRBAG LIGHT WOULD COME ON AND STAY ON, OR WOULD FLICKER OFF AND ONE AS I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD. THEY FOUND IT TO BE AN ISSUE WITH THE PASSENGER AIRBAG.  THEY REPAIRED IT THE FIRST THREE TIMES AND THE LIGHT WOULD STAY OFF FOR A WHILE. THE FOURTH TIME WE TOOK IT IN THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO TRY REPLACING THE WHOLE SEAT TO SEE IF THAT HELPED. WE DECIDED THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO RISK IT HAPPENING AGAIN AS THE VAN WAS LESS THAN 2,000 MILES FROM BEING OUT OF WARRANTY.     SO, WE TRADED IT IN FOR A 2018 KIA SEDONA WHICH NOW, AT 1400 MILES, HAS THE SAME ISSUE! WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN IT IN TWICE TO THE HAVE ISSUE REPAIRED. WHAT ARE THE ODDS OF HAVING THE EXACT SAME ISSUE?",
