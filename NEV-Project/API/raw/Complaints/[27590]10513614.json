I HAVE A 2012 FORD ESCAPE AND THIS VERY SAME THING HAS OCCURRED TO ME 3 TIMES. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE DATES, BUT IT HAS BEEN WITHIN THE LAST YEAR, BECAUSE I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE JULY 2012. I TOOK THE CAR TO LOCAL DEALERSHIP, EXPLAINED MY CONCERN & WAS TOLD \"IT WAS A DEFECTIVE COMPUTER SOFTWARE PROBLEM, SOFTWARE REPLACED.\"  I HAVEN'T HAD ANYMORE MORE EPISODES OF \"STALLING WITH ACCELERATION\" BUT IT'S VERY EVIDENT SOMETHING IS NOT RIGHT DURING ACCELERATION. THE VEHICLE SEEMS TO DECELERATE OR SOMETIMES \"JERK\" WITH ACCELERATION. I'M CONCERNED NOW THAT YOU ARE ONLY INVESTIGATING THE F-150'S & SHOULD BROADEN THE SCOPE OF YOUR INVESTIGATION TO INCLUDE THE ESCAPES OR ANY VEHICLE WITH ECO-BOOST.  *TR",
