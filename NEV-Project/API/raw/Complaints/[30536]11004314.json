VEHICLE HAD BEEN RECALLED IN PAST FOR SIMILAR ISSUE (PERFORMED). TANK HAS 4 ROLLOVER VALVES, ONLY ONE (FRONT DRIVER) INCLUDED IN PRIOR RECALL. INITIAL QUOTED $3,300 TO REPLACE TANK. AUDI OFFERED TO PAY FOR REPLACEMENT TANK WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ~$600 (REPAIR ORDER ATTACHED).  REPAIR COMPLETED ON 2/23/2017, CAR PASSES STATE INSPECTION. AS YOU CAN SEE BY THE \"STAINING\" IN THE ATTACHED PHOTO, THE LEAK WAS SIGNIFICANT    DEALER THEN CALLS TO SAY THAT CAR NEEDS TO BE RETURNED TO PERFORM PRIOR RECALL ON THE NEWLY INSTALLED TANK.  RECALL TO BE PERFORMED ON ONLY THE ONE ROLLOVER VALVE (DRIVER FRONT) THAT CAN BE ACCESSED WITH OUT REMOVING FUEL TANK.  NOT THE VALVE THAT WAS LEAKING AND NECESSITATED THE REPLACEMENT.    I REQUESTED THAT AUDI PERFORM RECALL ON ALL 4 ROLLOVER VALVES AS THEY INSTALLED A KNOWINGLY DEFECTIVE PART AND THE RISK OF ANOTHER CRACK/LEAK EXISTS.  DEALER SAYS AUDI REFUSES.  I HAVE MADE SEVERAL CALLS TO BOTH DEALER AND AUDI WITH NO RESPONSE FROM AUDI BEYOND A CONVERSATION WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE.  CHECK ENGINE LIGHT BACK ON 5/08/2017. EMAILED DEALER ON 5/11/2017 (ATTACHED PDF) WITH MY REQUEST (AGAIN), AND HAVE RECEIVED NO CONTACT FROM AUDI.  RETURNING CAR TO DEALER FOR RECALL ON THE ONE ROLLOVER VALVE ON 7/12/17.   AUDI IS PUTTING THIS CAR BACK ON THE ROAD WITH THE STRONG POTENTIAL OF A FUEL LEAK.",
