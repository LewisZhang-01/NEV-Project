CHRYSLER ISSUED A WARRANTY EXTENSION IN 2010 FOR ALL 2004 AND 2005 PACIFICAS FOR THIS PROBLEM AND THEN RESCINDED IT STATING THAT IT WOULD ONLY FIX THOSE THAT FELL WITHIN A 6 WEEK BUILD DATE - FEB 23-MARCH 31, 2004- WHICH MINE DID NOT.  HOWEVER, IT HAS COVERED OTHERS - WHOM I KNOW PERSONALLY - AT 100% AFTER CONSTANT APPEALS AND LETTERS AND A STORY WHICH AIRED ON CHANNEL 5 CHICAGO NEWS ON JANUARY 24 AND APRIL 15, 2014.  I HAVE CONTACTED CHANNEL 7, 5 AND 9 AND WILL NOT STOP UNTIL THIS IS FIXED.  IT UPSETS ME THAT THIS IS NOT GETTING FIXED WHEN THERE IS AN OBVIOUS PROBLEM - ONE IN WHICH CHRSYLER TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR AND THEN DECIDED NOT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.  *TR",
