        "summary": "I WENT IN TO A HUGGINS HONDA, A LOCAL DEALER IN HURST, TX TO SERVICE A RECALLED BRAKE MASTER CYLINDER REPLACEMENT IN MY 2006 ODYSSEY EXL WITH 80,000 MILES, WHILE AT THE VAN WAS AT THE DEALERSHIP, THE SERVICE MANAGER CALLED ME TO NOTIFY ME THAT THEY NOTICED THAT TWO MOTOR MOUNTS ALSO NEED TO BE REPLACED.  THE FRONT AND SIDE MOTOR MOUNT CAN BE REPLACED FOR ABOUT $1220 AND $216 + TAX RESPECTIVELY. HE INDICATED THAT THIS IS VERY COMMON ON HONDA ODYSSEY VANS AND NOT PART OF A RECALL OR REGULAR MAINTENANCE.  I ASKED IF IT WAS \"VERY\" COMMON IN HONDA VANS AND NOT PART OF NORMAL MAINTENANCE, WHY IS IT NOT FIX FOR FREE SINCE IT SEEM UNCOMMON FOR MOTOR MOUNT TO GO BAD THAT EARLY IN THE VEHICLE'S LIFE?  HE INDICATED THAT HE DID NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO FIX IT FREE ON THE VEHICLE BUT WANTED TO LET ME KNOW THAT IT DOES NEED TO BE FIXED.    I DID A SEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT PRE-MATURE MOTOR MOUNT FAILURE IS A COMMON ISSUE WITH HONDA ODYSSEY VANS DATING BACK TO EARLY 2000 MODELS.  IF THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE, WHY DID HONDA NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUE WITH THE NEWER MODELS AND WHY NOT FIX THE ISSUE FOR ODYSSEY OWNERS?  I THINK THAT HONDA SHOULD FIX THE ISSUE WITH CURRENT OWNERS AND ADDRESS THE ISSUE WITH NEWER MODELS.  *TR",
