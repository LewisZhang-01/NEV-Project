I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO JEFFREY BUICK 30800 GRATIOT AVE ROSEVILLE, MICHIGAN 48066 ON 12/27/02 BECAUSE MY CAR WOULD NOT KEEP ANTIFREEZE IN THE RESERVOIR  (POSSIBLE COOLANT LEAK) AND THE DASHBOARD LOW COOLANT AND SERVICE ENGINE SOON (SES) LIGHT WAS ON. THE CAR WAS MISSING AND BACKFIRING DURING ENGINE START UP AND WAS ALMOST STALLING WHILE DRIVING. I TOOK THE CAR INTO THE SHOP AND TOLD THE SERVICE SALES ADVISOR KENNETH HOPE WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM. IT WAS DIAGNOSED AS A SPARK PLUG PROBLEM AND SECONDARY IGNITION WIRE. I APPROVE FOR THEM TO DO THE REPAIRS.  ON DECEMBER 30, 2002 I WAS BACK AT JEFFREY BUICK SERVICE FOR THE SAME PROBLEM, LOW COOLANT/SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT (SES) AND ANTIFREEZE RESERVOIR NOT KEEPING COOLANT. ON DECEMBER 31, 2002  SERVICE SALES ADVISOR JON PINGEL STATED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS DUE TO THE ENGINE BURNING COOLANT, AND THAT THE UPPER PLASTIC INTAKE MANIFOLD/INTAKE GASKET. R&R 3.8.K HAD TO BE REPLACED. I  CAME INTO THE SHOP AND ASKED HIM WHAT HAD CAUSED THE PROBLEM. HE STATED TO ME THAT THIS IS AN ON GOING PROBLEM, A MANUFACTURE DEFECTED WITH THE BUICK REGAL WERE THAT THE HOSE WILL MELT AND LET COOLANT INTO THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT, HE ALSO INDICATED THAT HE RECEIVES BETWEEN FIVE TO TEN BUICK REGALS A WEEK WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. I ASKED IF THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM AND HE STATED NO. HE THEN STATED THAT IF THE PROBLEM IS NOT REPAIRED IT COULD LEAD TO THE ENGINE LOCKING UP OR A POSSIBLE ENGINE FIRE. HE STATED THAT I COULD CONTACT THE GENERAL MOTORS CUSTOMER RELATIONS DEPARTMENT AND MAKE A COMPLAINT AND SEE IF THEY WOULD REIMBURSE ME THE COST OF THE REPAIR $771.81.   I CALLED THE GM CUSTOMER RELATIONS DEPARTMENT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE.  CONSUMERS OF THE BUICK REGAL MUST KNOW OF THE POSSIBLE DANGERS INVOLVED WITH THE ENGINE/COOLANT PROBLEM AND BE REIMBURSED FOR REPAIRS DONE. IF YOU CAN PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS BEFORE SOMEONE DIES LIKE IN THE FIRESTONE TIRES INCIDENT.   *NLM",
