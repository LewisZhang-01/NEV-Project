THE PREVIOUS OWNER ALSO STATED THAT SHE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR NOT STARTING IN THE MORNING AND HAVING TO WAIT ABOUT 15 MINUTES.   HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT STALLING, BUT HAVE ONLY HAD IT 2 MONTHS.  OCCASIONALLY WHILE AT A LIGHT OR IN PARK, I FEEL THE CAR JOLT SLIGHTLY AND THE RPM GAUGE MOVING, AND WHILE IN PARK PRESSED THE GAS TO SEE WHAT IT WOULD DO, AND WHILE MY FOOT WAS STEADY ON GAS, THE RPM WENT UP AND DOWN LIKE CRAZY.  MECHANIC FRIEND OF MINE LOOKED AT MOTOR BRIEFLY AND SAID I HAD A BAD SENSOR.  *TR",
