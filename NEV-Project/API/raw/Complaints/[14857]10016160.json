ALSO, HER SISTER'S FIRESTONE TIRE BLEW 1 YEAR LATER ON HER 1998 HONDA CIVIC WHILE DRIVING ON ANOTHER FLORIDA HIGHWAY.  THE PROBABILITIES OF SUCH INCIDENTS HAPPENING TO ONE FAMILY MUST BE HIGH UNLESS THERE IS A DEFECT IN THESE FIRESTONE TIRES.  LUCKILY NO ONE WAS INJURED BUT THAT IS PROBABLY BECAUSE THESE WERE NOT SUV'S.  DATE OF INCIDENT IS ESTIMATED SINCE IT WAS A MINOR INCIDENT AND NO ONE WAS INJURED BUT IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THESE FIRESTONE TIRES MAY NOT BE SAFE.  PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT THE MAKE OF THESE TIRES ARE UNKNOWN SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN DISCARDED A LONG TIME AGO.    *NLM",
