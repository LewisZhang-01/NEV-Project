I HAVE SPENT OVER $1000 TRYING TO REPAIR THE ABS SYSTEM (INCLUDING REPLACING THE WIRING HARNESS FOR WHAT GM CALL AN \"UPDATED WIRING HARNESS,\" REPLACING LEFT AND RIGHT WHEEL BARONS, AND REPLACING THE ABS RELAY). THE BRAKES CONSISTENTLY HAVE TROUBLE AND PULSE WHEN TRYING TO STOP THE VEHICLE. I AM ALSO EXPERIENCING CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE WITH THE COMPUTER SYSTEM IN THE CAR. THE ANTI THEFT LIGHT AND AIR BAG LIGHTS COME ON AND STAY ON, CREATING CODES IN THE COMPUTER, WITH NO VISIBLE REASONS FOR THE CODES. THE GAS PEDAL HAS ALSO BEEN REPAIRED TWICE AS IT HAS A TENDENCY TO STICK. THE LEFT REAR STRUT MOUNTS HAVE ALSO BROKEN AND HAVE HAD TO BE REPAIRED (QUITE COSTLY). I AM BECOMING INCREASINGLY CONCERNED FOR SAFETY WHILE DRIVING THIS CAR.  *NLM",
