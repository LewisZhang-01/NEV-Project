        "summary": "I WAS NOT TOLD BY ANYONE IN THE SERVICE  DEPT OF THE RADIATOR ASSEMBLY ISSUE WITH NISSAN 2005-2010 FRONTIER, PATHFINDER, AND XTERRA. I FOUND THIS INFORMATION BY SURFING NISSAN WEBSITE. I DID THIS BECAUSE I WAS BEING TOLD BY EVERY REPAIR SHOP IN THE SURROUNDING AREA OF BIRMINGHAM THAT NISSAN IS WELL AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND SHOULD DO A RECALL ON IT. I CALLED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS ON 1-10-2011 ABOUT THE INFORMATION THAT I DISCOVERED. I WAS TOLD THAT I NEEDED TO TAKE MY VEHICLE BACK TO THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP TO ACCESS THE REPAIRS A BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN OVER 30 DAYS SINCE I TOOK MY VEHICLE INTO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE. THEN, MY REQUEST WOULD BE REVIEWED BY CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO SEE IF NISSAN WOULD PAY FOR THE REPAIRS. I EXPLAINED TO THE REPRESENTATIVE THAT I DID NOT HAVE ANOTHER $100 TO HAVE THE SERVICE DEPT TO TELL ME THE SAME THING AGAIN. I GOT AN EMAIL 2 WEEKS AGO FROM NISSAN FOR A SURVEY AND NEVER HEARD ANYTHING BACK. I AM PAYING FOR A VEHICLE I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE SINCE NOVEMBER OF 2011. WHEN I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE IN 2008 I ALSO PURCHASED THE EXTENDED WARRANTY WITH NISSAN, WHICH NOW IS EXPIRED. I COULD NOT AFFORD TO PAY $5,695 FOR REPAIRS SO I WENT OUT AND FOUND A LICENSE TRANSMISSION SHOP THAT COULD DO IT AT A LESSER AMOUNT. THE TRANSMISSION SHOP TOLD ME THAT THEY ARE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME WITH NISSAN AND ORDERING PARTS FOR THE TRANSMISSION BECAUSE NISSAN CAN NOT PRODUCE THE PARTS FAST ENOUGH DUE TO THE HIGH DEMAND FOR REPAIRS FOR THIS ISSUE. EVEN THOUGH, I HAVE 114,700 MILES ON MY VEHICLE I AM ASKING NISSAN TO DO THE HONORABLE THING AND PAY FOR THE REPAIRS.  *TR",
