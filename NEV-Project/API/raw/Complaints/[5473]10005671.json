I WAS LUCKY THAT I WAS SITTING IN A PARKING LOT AND STARTED TO TURNED THE STEERING WHEEL, THERE WAS A SNAP AND I WAS UNABLE TO TURN THE WHEELS OF THE TRUCK A 97 FORD RANGER. I SENT AN EMAIL TO FOR ON JANUARY 28, 2003 ABOUT THIS ITEM AND THEY HAVE NOT RESPONDED, THE TRACKING ID IS KMM2029449C0KM CASE ID 688902. I AM NORMALLY OUT ON THE HIGHWAY TRAVELING AT OVER 65 MPH ON WEEKEND AND HAD THE BOLTS SNAPPED WHILE MOVING AT THIS SPEED I WOULD PROBABLY BE DEAD. IS THERE ANY RECORDS OF THIS PROBLEM REPORTED BY ANYONE THAT IS STILL ALIVE? THANKS FOR YOU HELP. JUST WANTED T O INFORM YOU OF THIS HAPPENING. I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING ON A VEHICLE. AS FAR AS I CAN DETERMINE THIS VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT. MOST OF THE 76,000 MILES HAS BEEN DRIVEN ON THE HIGHWAYS.  THANKS AGAIN.",
