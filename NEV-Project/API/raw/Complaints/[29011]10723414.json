        "summary": "HAVE NOTICED AFTER A HEAVY AND DRIVING RAIN THAT THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS ACTS UP. WE CALL IT CRAZY CAR! ALL THE DASH LIGHTS BLINK & FLASH, BELLS DING AND GAUGES FLUCTUATE WHILE THE VEHICLE IS AT REST AND ON THE MOVE.  WE SHUT THE ENGINE OFF, SIT FOR A MINUTE AND RESTART ONLY TO GET THE SAME THING.  THAT MAY HAPPEN FOR THE ENTIRE RIDE DURATION OR WE MAY GET NO DASH LIGHTS AT ALL. IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THERE IS A SHORT OR A MOISTURE THAT CREATES THIS HAPPENING BECAUSE AFTER A FEW DAYS OF GOOD SUNNY WEATHER WHERE THE WATER HAS EVAPORATED FROM THE ROADWAYS, OUR BELOVED RAINER COMES BACK TO NORMAL.  WE STILL EXPERIENCE THE DIMMING OF THE HEADLIGHTS AS WE ARE DRIVING AT NIGHT WHEN WE ARE CRUISING WITH NO GAS PEDAL APPLICATION AT AROUND THE 32 MPH MARKING WHICH IS RATHER ANNOYING AS OTHER DRIVERS FEEL AS IF WE ARE FLASHING THEM.  WE SEE A DOWN SURGE IN THE BATTERY GAUGE DROP FOR 14 VOLTS TO 11 VOLTS AND THEN COME BACK UP. SOMETIMES THIS CAN HAPPEN ONCE OR TWICE DURING A 10 MILE RIDE OR AS MANY AS 50! WE WONDER, WHEN, OH, WHEN WILL GM PAY ATTENTION TO THESE COMPLAINTS OR ARE WE JUST TALKING INTO THE WIND?",
