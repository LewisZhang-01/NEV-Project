ONE IS A RED BRAKE LIGHT , AND  THE OTHER IS AN  AMBER ABS LIGHT.  I TOOK VEHICLE  TO THE   CHEVROLET  DEALER.  THEY TOLD ME IT WAS THE BRAKE CONTROL MODULE WHICH NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $1000.00.  ONCE THE UNIT HEATS UP AND THE LIGHTS COME ON THE ABS NO LONGER WORKS, AND THE BRAKES BECOME  JERKY.  ALSO THE TWO LIGHTS BLIND YOU AT NIGHT WHEN  YOU DRIVE.    THE UNIT IS ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CAR  UNDER THE DRIVER'S SEAT NEXT TO THE EXHAUST PIPE.  I  TOLD THEM THEY NEEDED TO FIX IT, AND THEY REFUSED,   SAYING IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  I TOLD THEM THAT IT  WAS A DESIGN FLAW BECAUSE IT WAS PLACED NEXT TO THE  EXHAUST.    THE  INDIVIDUAL AT THE DEALER TOLD ME THIS WAS A  COMMON PROBLEM WITH GM TRUCKS AND VANS.  IT WAS  SAFETY  ISSUE AND GM  REFUSED  TO FIX IT.  *AK",
