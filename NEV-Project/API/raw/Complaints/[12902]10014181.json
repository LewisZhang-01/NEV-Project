AFTER THE FOURTH TIME OF BEING IN THE SHOP THE ONE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT I HAVE A BENT OR DENTED DRIVE SHAFT, EVEN THOUGH I HAVE ONLY HAD THE VEHICLE FOR SIX MONTHS. AND I HAVE NEVER HIT ANYTHING, TAKEN THE VEHICLE OFF ROAD OR RAN OVER ANYTHING TO DENT OR BEND THIS DRIVE SHAFT. THE DEALERSHIP NOTIFIED ME THIS WAS AN IMPACT PROBLEM AND THAT IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE DRIVE SHAFT AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY. $800. I JUST BOUGHT THE CAR SIX MONTHS. AGO AND I DON'T FEEL I SHOULD BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES THAT WERE NOT CAUSED BY MYSELF. MY DOORS ALSO LOCK BY THEMSELVES REPEATEDLY AND ALL FOUR DEALERS SAID THEY FIXED THE PROBLEM BUT THEY STILL LOCK BY THEMSELVES. THE ENGINE RUNS LIKE THE CAR IS ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS OLD. *JB",
