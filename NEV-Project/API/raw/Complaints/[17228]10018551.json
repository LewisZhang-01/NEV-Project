WE HAVE REGULARLY SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE DONE ON THE CAR, ALONG WITH SCHEDULED OIL CHANGES, CHECKING BELTS, HOSES, ETC.  WE ARE CONSTANTLY HAVING OUR BRAKES REPAIRED/REPLACED. LAST YEAR WE NEEDED TO HAVE A BRAKE BOOSTER REPLACED WHICH COST US OVER $700 AND TODAY WE WERE TOLD THAT OUR \"ENTIRE\" COOLING SYSTEM IS CORRODED...$1,900.  AT 59,000 MILES I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THIS SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED.   *NLM",
