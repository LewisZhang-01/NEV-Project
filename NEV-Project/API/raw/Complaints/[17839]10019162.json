THIS IS MY SECOND JEEP LIBERTY WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE FIRST WAS A 2002 JEEP LIBERTY SPORT (4X4) WITH A VIBRATION PROBLEM.  THE DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE FRONT AND REAR DRIVES SHAFTS ON THIS VEHICLE, WHICH DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  THIS VEHICLE WAS REPLACED BY CHRYSLER UNDER THE WISCONSIN LEMON LAW.  MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW WITH THE JEEP LIBERTY THAT CHRYSLER DOES NOT HAVE A FIX FOR.",
