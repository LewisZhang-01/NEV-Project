AFTER TROUBLESHOOTING & REPLACING THE RECOMMENDED FUSE, WE CONTINUED TO HAVE PROBLEMS. EACH TIME WE TURNED ON THE IGNITION ANOTHER BLOWN FUSE! WE THEN REMOVED THE GAS TANK & INSPECTED THE FUEL PUMP. WHAT WAS FOUND THE FIRST TIME, WAS ACCEPTABLE. BUT FINDING THE SAME PROBLEM ON ANOTHER 2 VANS HAS GOT US WORRIED. THE \"BLACK\" AND \"GRAY\" WIRE FUSED THEMSELVES TOGETHER WHILE INSIDE THE GAS TANK! COULD THIS BE A FIRE/EXPLOSION POTENTIAL? WHAT IF A HIGHER AMP FUSE WAS USED IN COMBINATION WITH A THE FUEL TANK THAT WAS LESS THAN FULL..*AK",
