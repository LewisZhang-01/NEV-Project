UPON INTERNET RESEARCH, I HAVE FOUND THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH GM TRUCK AND SUV MODELS IN THE YEARS 2003-2006.  TRAILBLAZER IS THE ONLY MODEL THAT GM HAS NOT COVERED IN A RECALL FOR THIS PART MALFUNCTION.  HOW CAN IT BE SAFE TO DRIVE AND NOT KNOW WHAT SPEED I AM TRAVELING AT?  I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT WITH CHEVROLET TOMORROW.  THEY WILL NOT FIX THE PROBLEM UNTIL THEIR TECHNICIAN CAN DIAGNOSIS IT...AND CHARGE ME AN EXTRA $99.00, EVEN THOUGH THE PROBLEM HAS ALL READY BEEN DIAGNOSED BY CERTIFIED, EXPERIENCED MECHANIC.  AT THE TIME THIS FIRST OCCURRED, THE SPEEDOMETER REGISTERED 115 MPH; MY HUSBAND ESTIMATES HE WAS DRIVING 25-30MPH.  *TR",
