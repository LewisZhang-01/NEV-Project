I AM A 4'11\" DRIVER, WHO DRIVES SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY AND HAVE ALMOST HIT SEVERAL PEDESTRIANS WHO WERE WALKING ACROSS THE STREET AS I WAS CROSSING THROUGH AN INTERSECTION DUE TO COMPLETE VISUAL OBSTRUCTION OF THEM DUE TO THE A-PILLARS ON BOTH THE DRIVER'S SIDE AND THE PASSENGER SIDE. IF I RAISE MYSELF UP USING A CUSHION ON THE SEAT AND SUBSEQUENTLY RAISE THE STEERING WHEEL UP TO ALLOW FOR MY LEGS TO PASS UNDER IT, THEN THE STEERING WHEEL OBSTRUCTS THE VIEW OF THE SPEEDOMETER. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE EITHER A MORE ADJUSTABLE SEAT OR A CHANGE IN POSITION OF THE A PILLAR TO ALLOW FOR BETTER VISION FOR A SHORT DRIVER IN THIS CAR. UNFORTUNATELY, I THINK I'LL HAVE TO SELL THIS CAR IN ORDER TO NOT RUN THE RISK OF HITTING A PEDESTRIAN. *TR",
