        "summary": "MY 2001 VW PASSAT GLS WAS HIT IN THE REAR BY A LARGE 89 CHEVY VAN.  THE SEAT THAT I WAS SITTING IN RECLINED ALMOST ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE BACK SEAT SO THAT I WAS LOOKING UP AT THE ROOF.  MY SEAT BELT CUT MY HEAD AND WRIST OF MY LEFT ARM AS I FELL BACK.  I KNOW IT WAS THE SEAT BELT BECAUSE THERE WAS SKIN ON THE SHOULDER PORTION OF IT.  AFTER THE ACCIDENT I LOOKED AT THE TOTALLED CAR AND NOTICED THAT THE SEAT HAD SHIFTED.  THE FRONT THIGH SUPPORT PORTION CAME UP, AND THE BACK SUPPORT WENT DOWN.  UPON CLOSE INSPECTION, I THINK THAT THE SEAT BRACKETS YIELDED IN THE COLLISION CHANGING THE OVERALL ORIENTATION OF THE SEAT.  I WAS NOT SERIOUSLY INJURED, AS FAR AS I KNOW I JUST HAD A CASE OF WHIPLASH.  HOWEVER, I AM STAYING IN TOUCH WITH MY DOCTOR SHOULD ANY ADDITIONAL BACK OR NECK PROBLEMS COME OUT OF THIS.  HOWEVER, I COULD HAVE BEEN EJECTED FROM THE SEAT OR THROW INTO THE BACK, NOT TO MENTION THE SERIOUS INJURIES THE SEAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED TO A PERSON SITTING IN BACK OF ME.  I CALLED VW AND THE REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS THAT THE SEAT IS DESIGNED TO GIVE IN A SEVERE REAR IMPACT.  I ASKED FOR A STATEMENT IN WRITING, AND THEY AGREED TO THIS BUT I HAVE YET TO SEE IT.  (IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE COMING) I HAVE THE DATE AND TIME OF THAT PHONE CONVERSATION.  I ALSO HAVE PICTURES OF THE CAR, THE SEAT,AND THE BRACKETS.  VW DOES NOT ADVERTISE ANY SPECIAL SEAT FEATURES LIKE VOLVO'S WHIPS PROTECTION, SO I AM WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THIS SEAT DESIGN.  A QUICK INTERNET SEARCH SHOWED THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE HAD SIMILAR EVENTS IN A REAR IMPACT.  CLUBB5.COM, AND AUDIWORLD.COM BOTH HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS IN THE FORUMS.  IF THIS IS A POOR SEAT DESIGN, I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD ALL BE FIXED.",
