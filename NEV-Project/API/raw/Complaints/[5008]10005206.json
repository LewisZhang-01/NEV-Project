        "summary": "FOR THE THIRD TIME, MY '95 FORD EXPLORER DURING NORMAL OPERATION HAS HAD THE THROTTLE STUCK OPEN AND ACCELERATE TO THE POINT WHERE THE TRUCK WILL NOT SLOW DOWN EVEN WHILE APPLYING THE BRAKES. EVEN WHEN THE CAR HAS BEEN PUT INTO THE NEUTRAL POSITION THE ENGINE CONTINUES TO REV. I HAVE TO THROW THE TRUCK INTO PARK AND TURN THE TRUCK OFF BEFORE THE ENGINE WILL SLOW DOWN. THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED A FEW YEARS AGO- I HAD A NEW TRANSMISSION PUT IN. THE SECOND TIME THIS OCCURRED MY MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS BUILD-UP WHICH CAUSED THE THROTTLE TO REMAIN OPEN. THIS IS THE THIRD TIME IN A YEAR AND A HALF AND I AM NOW PETRIFIED TO DRIVE MY ONCE BELOVED VEHICLE. I CAN'T POSSIBLY IMAGINE SELLING THIS CAR AND HAVING THIS HAPPEN TO ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. LUCKILY, THE SECOND TIME THIS HAPPENED A CO-WORKER WAS IN THE TRUCK AND I HAVE AN EYEWITNESS. PLEASE HELP ME!! I AM JUST A NORMAL HARD-WORKING PERON THAT IS TRYING TO GET THIS PROBLEM FIXED AND AM BECOMING MORE FRIGHTENED BY THE RESEARCH I AM FINDING ON THIS SUBJECT OF THE \"OPEN THROTTLE\".  THANKS  -DANI MENZEL",
