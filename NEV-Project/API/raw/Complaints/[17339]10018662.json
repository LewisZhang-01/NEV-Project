I CONTINUE GOING AND THEN THE CRUISE WILL TAKE OVER ON IT'S OWN AND START WORKING AND WHEN I STOP, IT STOPS.  I TAKE OFF AND THEN IT WILL KICK IN AND LOCK ON AND WORK AND OTHER TIMES, WHEN I WANT IT TO, IT WON'T WORK AT ALL.  WOULD THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SPRINGS AND SET UP WITH THE AIR BAG RECALL ON THE 1997 DODGE RAM PICK-UPS, WHICH I NEVER RECEIVED.  I DID GET THE RECALL FOR THE HOOD LATCH PROBLEM AND HAD THAT FIXED IMMEDIATELY.     I OWN A 1997 DODGE RAM 1500 PICK-UP TRUCK AND THE MILEAGE JUST TURNED 50,000, PLUS I HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON IT ALSO.   *NLM",
