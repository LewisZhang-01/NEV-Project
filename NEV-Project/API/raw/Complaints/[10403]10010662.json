THERE IS NO SPECIFIC PATTERN.  IT IS A RANDOM THING.  IT'S ALMOST LIKE THERE IS A SHORT IN THE WIRING OR SOMETHING.   THE INCIDENT DATE BELOW IS TODAY, BUT THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR MONTHS.  I HAVE BEEN CHECKING RECALLS RELIGIOUSLY TO SEE IF THIS WAS ONE OF THEM.    ALSO THERE IS RUST UNDER THE DRIVER'S SEAT.  THE CARFAX REPORT DID NOT SHOW ANY WATER DAMAGE TO THIS VEHICLE.  IT ALMOST APPEARS LIKE THIS PIECE DID NOT GET PAINTED.  *JB",
