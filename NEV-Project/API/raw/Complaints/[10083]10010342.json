HAVE TRIED TO GET INFORMATION FROM GMC ON HOW TO HAVE MY LOCAL GMC DEALERSHIP FIX THE PROBLEM. GMC RESPONSE WAS TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER AND THEY WILL FIGURE IT OUT. HOW LONG COULD THAT TAKE AT MY EXPENSE? ACCORDING TO WHAT I HAVE SEEN ON THE INTERNET THE 1995-96 YUKON'S WERE SUBJECT TO THIS PROBLEM. THEREFORE GMC SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL THEIR DEALER HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR HELP. THANK YOU.*JB",
