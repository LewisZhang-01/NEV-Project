        "summary": "AT AN OUTSIDE FUNCTION, LOADED MY 2 YEAR OLD IN THE BACK SEAT THEN PUT MY BAGS ON FRONT PASSENGER SIDE. SHUT THE DOOR ONLY TO FIND OUT IT IS NO LONGER LATCHING SO MY FRONT PASSENGER DOOR WILL NOT CLOSE AT ALL. IT WAS A SATURDAY JUST BEFORE NOON. CONTACTED 3 DEALERS ALL OF WHOM TOLD ME TO DRIVE MY CAR TO THEM BUT THEY WOULDN'T EVEN LOOK AT IT UNTIL MONDAY. NONE HAVE PART AVAILABLE AS THIS ISSUE IS ACTUALLY A RECALL. TOLD THEM IT WOULD BE UNSAFE TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE, LET ALONE WITH A TODDLER IN THE BACKSEAT. THEY ALL SAID THEY COULDN'T TOW IT UNLESS I PAID THE TOW BILL. ONE SUGGESTED I HOLD THE DOOR CLOSED WHILE DRIVING IT TO THEM. THE OTHER ADVISED I NEEDED TO FIND A PIECE OF ROPE TO TIE IT CLOSED. NO ONE KNOWS HOW LONG BEFORE IT IS ABLE TO BE REPAIRED. THEY'VE ALL SUGGESTED I DROP IT OFF UNTIL IT CAN BE REPAIRED BUT NONE CAN OFFER A RENTAL. THIS IS EXTREMELY UNACCEPTABLE. MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH WORK AND WE HAVE TWO SMALL CHILDREN. I ASKED WHAT I WOULD DO IN THE EVENT THAT IT RAINED BECAUSE THE INSIDE OF MY CAR WOULD GET WET. SO FOR NOW I'M STUCK AT HOME WITH A VEHICLE THAT IS USELESS WITH NO SOLUTION IN SITE. NOT TO MENTION THIS IS THE 4TH RECALL ON MY CAR!!! I WILL NEVER OWN ANOTHER FORD!!!!",
