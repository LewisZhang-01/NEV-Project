THE ENERGY GENERATED FROM THE ENGINE, WHILE PUMPING THE GAS PEDAL, IS NOT BEING  TRANSFERRED TO THE TRANSMISSION. EVENTUALLY THE VEHICLE ROLLS TO A COMPLETE STOP WITH THE ENGINE DEAD IN THE BUSY TRAFFIC, EFFECTIVELY PUTTING ME IN HARMS WAY. I TURNED THE IGNITION AND THE ENGINE STARTED, AFTER ABOUT A QUARTER MILE IT WILL STALL AND QUIT AGAIN. THIS PROCESS REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES AND EVENTUALLY THE VEHICLE QUIT FOR GOOD. IT WILL NOT START AGAIN. I HAD A WRECKER TOW THE VEHICLE TO THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP WHERE THE SERVICE AGENT TOLD ME,  APPROXIMATELY 24 HOURS LATER, THAT THE PROBLEM RESULTED FROM A CRACKED RADIATOR THAT LEAKED ANTIFREEZE INTO THE  TRANSMISSION AND SUBSEQUENTLY DAMAGING OR DESTROYING THE TRANSMISSION. THE AGENT TOLD ME THAT IT WILL COST SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS SINCE IT WILL ENTAIL INSTALLING NEW RADIATOR AND TRANSMISSION.   *TR",
