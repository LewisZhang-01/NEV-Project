        "summary": "FRONT TIRE \"FEATHERING.\" THERE IS A COMMON  FRONT END SUSPENSION PROBLEM WITH MANY OF THE FIRST YEAR NISSAN 350Z'S RELEASED THAT CAUSES THE FRONT TIRES TO WEAR UNEVENLY AND PREMATURELY FAIL. IT CAN FIRST BECOME NOTICEABLE AT SEVERAL THOUSAND MILES.  THE FRONT TIRES MAKE EXCESSIVE NOISE UNDER BRAKING AT SPEEDS BELOW 40 MPH.  I HAVE CONTACTED NISSAN NORTH AMERICA ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND HAD MY VEHICLE IN FOR SERVICE AT THE DEALERSHIP, BUT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, A FIX IS NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. I REPLACED THE  ORIGINAL TIRES AT 4000 MILES BECAUSE OF THE NOISE, THEN DISCOVERED AT A CHAT ROOM THAT MANY OTHER 350Z OWNERS WERE HAVING SIMILAR PROBLEMS. ONCE REMOVED, AN  INSPECTION SHOWED UNEVEN WEAR ON THE INSIDE EDGE OF THE TIRE THAT I WAS PREVIOUSLY UNAWARE OF.  NISSAN HAS AGREED TO REIMBURSE  THE COST OF ONE  REPLACEMENT SET OF  TIRES,  BUT MY CONCERN IS  THAT  THE VEHICLE WILL CONTINUE TO CAUSE PREMATURE TIRE WEAR PROBLEMS UNLESS FIXED. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, BUT AM CONVINCED THAT A MECHANICAL DEFECT EXISTS, NISSAN IS AWARE OF IT AND A MAJORITY OF EARLY ISSUE CARS ARE EFFECTED.  *JB",
