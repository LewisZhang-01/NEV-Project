A CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP STATED THE CAR SHOULD NOT BE DRIVEN  ON THE ROAD AT ALL!  MY ENGINE FAILED WHILE DRIVING 45 M.P.H., ALL POWER TO THE CAR DIED.  I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO SEVERAL CONCORDE OWNERS AND THIS IS A WELL KNOW PROBLEM WITH THESE. I STOP MAKING PAYMENT FOR THIS CAR AFTER THE ORIGINAL DEALERSHIP WHERE I BROUGHT IT FROM WOULD NOT FIX IT WHILE UNDER WARRANTY.  I FEAR FOR THE PERSON WHO HAS THIS CAR NOW, THEY COULD LOSE THEIR LIFE.*JB",
