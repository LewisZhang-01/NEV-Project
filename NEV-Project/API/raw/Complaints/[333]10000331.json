WE TOOK THE VEHICLE IN TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT AND THE SHOP SAID THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE. THEY SAID THAT WHEN THE ECT MODULE INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION GOES BAD, IT CAUSES THE WHOLE TRANSMISSION TO BURN OUT.  WE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALER TO GET A SECOND OPINION AND THEY TOO CONFIRMED THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAD GONE BAD, DUE TO THE MODULE GOING OUT. MY BOYFRIEND WORKS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE PARTS BUSINESS AND HE TALKED TO A FEW SHOPS ABOUT THIS VEHICLE AND THEY ALL SAID THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR THE CHRYSLER SEBRING. THE VEHICLE HAS ABOUT 112K MILES. WE WERE QUOTED 3K TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE AT THE  CHRYSLER DEALER. TS",
