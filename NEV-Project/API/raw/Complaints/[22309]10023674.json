WE HAVE FOUND THAT THERE ARE OVER 20 SUCH CASES IN OUR SMALL COMMUNITY ALONE. ALL ON 3800 MOTORS IN PONTIAC'S.  THIS IS A FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR REPAIR BILL THAT OCCURRED ONLY BECAUSE PONTIAC DECIDED TO USE PLASTIC IN THEIR PART WHICH IN TURN MELTED & CAUSED OUR MOTOR TO OVERHEAT.  I HOPE THAT PONTIAC WILL RECALL THESE PLENUMS & REIMBURSE US FOR THE COST OF REPAIRING & TOWING OUR CAR.  IF PONTIAC WOULD CALL THEIR DEALERS THEY WOULD FIND OUT JUST HOW MANY OF THESE PARTS HAVE MALFUNCTIONED.  *JB",
