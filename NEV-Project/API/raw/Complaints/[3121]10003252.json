ON AT LEAST THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, ONE OF THE SEAT BELTS SECURING MY DAUGHTERS' CAR SEATS IN HAS UNLATCHED WHILE I WAS DRIVING AND WAS I UNAWARE OF THIS UNTIL I STOPPED THE VEHICLE TO GET THEM OUT.  LUCKILY, NO INJURIES HAVE OCCURRED YET; HOWEVER, I CRINGE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT COULD OF OR WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I AM EVER IN AN ACCIDENT.  THE SEAT BELTS ARE GOING TO UNLATCH AND MY DAUGHTERS ARE GOING TO BE UNPROTECTED.  DODGE PROMOTES ITSELF AS BEING \"THE SAFEST MINIVAN\" AND A \"FAMILY MINIVAN\" WHICH IS WHY I CHOSE TO BUY THE DODGE CARAVAN. HOW UNTRUE THIS IS.  DODGE HAS A SERIOUS CRISIS WHICH MUST BE DEALT WITH IMMEDIATELY",
