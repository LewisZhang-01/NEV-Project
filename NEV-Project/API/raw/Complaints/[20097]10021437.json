WE HAVE TAKEN THE CAR IN FOR SERVICING NUMEROUS TIMES, BUT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THIS FIXED.  THE CAR HAS SEVERAL OTHER PROBLEMS SUCH AS:  KEYLESS ENTRY DOES NOT WORK, HEATED SEATS DO NOT WORK, AIR CONDITIONER DOES NOT WORK; HOWEVER, NONE OF THESE POSE A SAFETY PROBLEM LIKE THE STALLING.  THE ENGINE LIGHT REMAINS ON EVEN AFTER NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS BY THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM.  *JB",
