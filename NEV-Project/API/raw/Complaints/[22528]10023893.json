THIS CARS OIL HAS BEEN CHANGED RELIGIOUSLY, AND HAS NEVER HAD THE OIL LIGHT REGISTER A PROBLEM.  AFTER INVESTIGATING THE PROBLEM, JUST A BIT ON THE INTERNET, AS WELL WITH THE LOCAL DODGE DEALERS, I FOUND: IN JUST 2  SMALL DEALERSHIPS IN MY AREA, 17 AUTOS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND HAD TO EITHER DISCARD THE AUTO OR REPLACE THE ENGINE ($4900 APPROX.) THE INTERNET SHOWED NUMEROUS OTHER COMPLAINTS, INCLUDING ONE WHO WAS STARTING A CLASS-ACTION SUIT.  I HOPE YOUR AGENCY CAN HELP ME AND OTHER OWNERS WITH THIS SERIOUS CONSUMER PROBLEM.    THANKS.  *JB",
