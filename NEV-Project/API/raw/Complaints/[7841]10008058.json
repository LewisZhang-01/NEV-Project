WASHINGTON ST., INDIANAPOLIS, IN 46222 (317-636-8061) MODIFIY MY 1999 DODGE MINI VAN  WITH ZERO EFFORT STEERING & A PAC UNIT (POWER ASSIST HAND CONTROL). ALONG WITH THIS THERE WERE REMOTE SWITCHES INSTALLED FOR THE LIGHTS.WASHER, WIPER, & HORN. SINCE DRIVING IT AWAY FROM THEIR BUSINESS 10-16-02 THE BRAKES HAVE CONSTANTLY GRABBED AND THE STEERING WILL CATCH AS YOU APPLY THE BRAKES. THIS HAPPENS WHEN COMING TO A STOP LIGHT AND TRYING TO SLOW DOWN TURNING THE CORNER, OR IN A PARKING LOT WHEN TRYING TO PARK. THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN GOING DOWN HILL AND A CHILD WOULD RUN OUT IN FRONT OF ME THAT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WOULD LOCK UP, (YOU COULD NOT TURN THE STEERING WHEEL WHILE SWERVING TO MISS THE CHILD WHILE APPLYING THE BRAKES). THEY SAY THIS IS A NORMAL PHENOMENON. I SAY IT IS A DANGEROUS THING & SHOULD NOT BE ALOUD, AND AM ASKING FOR YOUR HELP IN STOPPING THIS PRODUCT FROM BEING PUT ON THE MARKET. I HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT BUT, ONLY BY THE GRACE OF GOD. I HAVE HAD THE VAN SETTING RUNNING AT AN IDLE SPEED WITHOUT BEING IN GEAR LOCK UP THE STEERING AND THE BRAKES. I HAD A BIG MAN WITH ME (OVER SIX FEET TALL) HE GOT OUT AND LOOKED & THE WHEELS WERE STRAIGHT (NOT TURNED ALL THE WAY EITHER WAY). HE WAS UNABLE TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL EITHER.*JB",
