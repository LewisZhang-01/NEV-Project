        "summary": "THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WENT ON AT ABOUT 82000 MILES FOR MY 1998 HONDA ACCORD LX, 4 CYLINDER.  AFTER REPLACING SPARK PLUG WIRES, SPARK PLUGS AND AIR FILTER, THE LIGHT WENT OFF FOR ABOUT A WEEK.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ILLUMINATED AGAIN.  THE COMPUTER CODE SAYS THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER.  HOWEVER, OTHERS ON THE FOLLOWING FORUM HAD THEIR CATALYTIC REPLACED, AND THE LIGHT RESUMED AFTER SOME PERIOD OF TIME:  THERE ARE SO MANY COMPLAINTS ON THIS FORUM OF THE SAME PROBLEM, THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE WHICH HONDA HAS FAILED TO ADDRESS.  THIS PROBLEM WILL PROBABLY SEVERELY REDUCE THE RESALE VALUE OF THE CAR, OR STOP ME FROM SELLING IT COMPLETELY.  *JB",
