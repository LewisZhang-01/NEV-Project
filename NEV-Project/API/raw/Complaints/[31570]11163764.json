        "summary": "VIOLENT SHAKE IN STEERING WHEEL AND THE BEGINNING OF LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. SPECIFICALLY AT HIGHWAY SPEED WHEN YOU DRIVE OVER A BUMP SUCH AS A BRIDGE EXPANSION JOINT, THE STEERING WHEEL WILL BEGIN SHAKING BACK AND FORTH VIOLENTLY. THIS RESONATES THROUGHOUT THE VEHICLE. IT CAN CONTINUE FOR IN EXCESS OF 15 SECONDS AND I NEED  TO REDUCE THE JEEP'S SPEED TO LESS THAN 40MPH, AT WHICH TIME THE SHAKING GENERALLY STOPS. SLOWING TO 40MPH IN HIGHWAY TRAFFIC IS DANGEROUS TO ME AND OTHERS ON THE HIGHWAY. IF IN A LOW TRACTION SITUATION (SUCH AS SNOW) THIS WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN TOTAL LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE JEEP. THIS HAS BEEN TO THE DEALER 3 TIMES FOR THIS PROBLEM. BECAUSE THE DEALER IS LOCATED IN A RURAL AREA THEY HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO DRIVE TO A HIGHWAY AND THEREFORE HAVE NOT REPLICATED THE PROBLEM. THE LAST TIME I WENT TO THE DEALER I SHOWED THE DEALERSHIP MANAGER A VIDEO OF THIS OCCURRING, AND HE WAS APPALLED AND SAID IT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN AND THAT I SHOULD CALL JEEP CUSTOMER CARE WHICH I DID. I HAVE CALLED ON DECEMBER 1,12,19,26 AND 27. THE CASE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED TO A CASE MANAGER, BUT THEY HAVE NOT CALLED ME. I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO ESCALATE TO A MANAGER, BUT I HAVE TOLD THEY ARE BUSY AND NOTHING THEY CAN DO,  JEEP HAS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE WITH MY CAR AND THEY HAVE TO DATE REFUSED TO EVEN CALL ME BACK ( I HAVE ALSO CONFIRMED MY PHONE NUMBERS EACH TIME I HAVE CALLED AND HAD THEM RECORDED IN THE CASE RECORD).",
