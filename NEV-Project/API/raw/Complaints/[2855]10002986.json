        "summary": "AFTER MEETING WITH DISTRICT PARTS AND SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGER STEVE CARLSON ON 9/23/02. I''VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT TOYOTA WILL NOT FIX THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE SMELL COMING FROM MY 2001 SEQUOIA.  FIRST OF ALL, I HAD TO CALL THE DEALERSHIP AT 10:30 IN MORNING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MANAGER WAS GOING TO BE THERE. SECOND IS THAT I GOT THE RUN AROUND ABOUT I SHOULD TRY A ''FOR FUN AND GIGGLES'' BY NOT RUNNING MY RECYCLING MODE WHEN DRIVING WITH THE A/C ON. THIRD IS THAT WHEN THE FRONT WINDOWS ARE OPEN I''M STILL GETTING THE WORST SMELL OF EXHAUST COMING FROM THE REAR. I UNDERSTAND HIS POINT ABOUT THE BALANCE OF AIR WITH OPENING AND CLOSING OF BAFFLES IN THE REAR AND FRONT OF THE VEHICLE. I WANT TO MAKE A NOTE THAT THE VENTING OF THIS VEHICLE WITHOUT THE RECYCLING ON IS THE WORST I''VE HAD IN ALL THE VEHICLES I''VE OWNED. THE IDEA OF ASKING ME TO USE THE FRONT VENTS INSTEAD OF RECYCLING IS A CATCH 22. WHERE IF I KEEP THE RECYCLING ON AND SMELL THE EXHAUST SMELL WITH IT''S 0% EMISSIONS IN MY VEHICLE COMPARED TO OPENING THE FRONT VENT AND SMELLING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME WITH WHO KNOWS WHAT. FOURTH, I HAVE TO GET ENOUGH PEOPLE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BEFORE TOYOTA WILL DO ANYTHING TO FIX THIS DESIGN FAULT",
