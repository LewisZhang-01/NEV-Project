I INFORMED THEM NOT TO I AM NOT DONE WITH THIS ISSUE WITH THEM... THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM OR DEFECT WITH MY GENERAL MOTORS PONTIAC GRAND AM SE 3.1L V6 ENGINE IN THIS VEHICLE. I HAVE HAD, 3 INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET FAILURES IN LESS THAN 40,000 MILES, THE FIRST OCCURRING AT APPROX 24,000 MILES THE SECOND AT APPROX 27,000 MILES AND NOW AGAIN AT 40,000 MILES BUT I HAVE SUSPECTED THE ANTI-FREEZE I HAVE BEEN SMELLING IN THE CAB WHEN I TURN THE HEATER BLOWER ON, IS SOMEHOW CONNECTED TO THIS LEAK. WHICH MEANS ITS BEEN LEAKING FOR SOME TIME JUST NOT BAD ENOUGH TO DRIP ONTO THE GROUND BRINGING MY ATTENTION TO IT. I AM ONLY ONE OF THOUSANDS OF VICTIMS THAT GENERAL MOTORS HAS RAPED FINANCIAL OVER THE YEARS. THE REPEATED FAILURES OF THE INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET STARTED LONG AGO AND DUE TO THE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS TO THE BBB AND GM YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO ALARM GENERAL MOTORS THAT THEY ARE HAVING A MAJOR ISSUE, AND THEY SHOULD OF BEGAN A RECALL OF THEIR VEHICLES LONG AGO. IN THE YEAR 2002 THEY COULDN'T SUPPLY ENOUGH INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKETS TO KEEP UP WITH THE GM VEHICLES THAT NEEDED REPAIR EITHER UNDER WARRANTY OR OUT OF WARRANTY. I HAVE HAD OTHER MAJOR NON-RELATED REPAIRS TO MY VEHICLE AS WELL, 19,693 MILES THE SWAY BAR BUSHINGS HAD TO BE REPLACED, ALTERNATOR WAS REPLACED, HEATER CORE REPLACED, THE RACK AND PINION STEERING ROD REPLACED. NOW MY CAR AND MANY THOUSANDS OF OTHER GM OWNERS VEHICLES ARE OUT OF WARRANTY AND GM WON'T STAND BEHIND THEIR OWN VEHICLES, EVEN THOUGH WORK WAS DONE REPEATEDLY UNDER WARRANTY ON MY VEHICLE. I AM CURRENTLY 3 YEARS OUT OF WARRANTY BUT ONLY 12,900 APPROX MILES SINCE THEY DID THE LAST REPAIR ON MY INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKETS. I BELIEVE A CLASS ACTION SUIT IS THE ONLY THING GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION WILL RESPOND TO.   *JB",
