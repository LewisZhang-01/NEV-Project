THE LETTER ALSO STATES.. DO NOT BRING YOUR VEHICLE TO THE DEALER UNLESS THIS OCCURS.  THE STATED IF THIS CONDITION OCCURS WITHIN SEVEN YEARS OR 100,000 MILES THEY WILL REPLACE THE CYLINDER HEAD FREE OF CHARGE.. MY CAR IS 8 YEARS OLD NOW AND HAS ONLY 79000 MILES ON IT.  NEITHER THE DEALER OR PONTIAC CORP. WILL REPAIR THIS FOR ME WITHOUT PAYING FOR ALL CHARGES WHICH ARE APPROX. $1200.00.. PONTIAC ADMITS THAT THIS ENGINE HAS A DEFECT.. BUT REFUSES TO HONOR THE 100,000 MILE LIMIT BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS 8 YEARS OLD.  IT IS MY OPINION THAT PONTIAC IS RESPONSIBLE TO FIX THIS VEHICLE AS IT IS A SAFETY HAZARD.. MY VEHICLE HAS THE KNOWN DEFECT.. THE ODOR FROM THE COOLANT IS EXTREMELY STRING AND IS A SAFETY CONCERN FOR ME AND MY FAMILY.  YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT LEAKS FROM THE HEAD AS THERE IS CORROSION AND THE ANTI-FREEZE PUDDLES UP ON TOP OF THE HEAD.  *JB    ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*****732124*****",
