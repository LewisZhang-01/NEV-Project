        "summary": "THE CROUCH STRAP ON OUR CHILD SAFETY SEAT (COSCO/DOREL ALPHA OMEGA, MODEL #02-531) CAME COMPLETELY DETACHED FROM SEAT WHILE MY CHILD WAS RESTRAINED IN SEAT ON A CAR RIDE.  WHEN MY HUSBAND WENT TO REMOVE MY CHILD FROM THE SEAT AT THE END OF THE CAR RIDE, HE FOUND THAT THE CROUCH STRAP WAS JUST LYING IN THE SEAT WITH HIM. MY SON HAD APPARENTLY SCOOTED DOWN IN THE SEAT AFTER THE STRAP CAME LOOSE AND THE HARD PLASTIC CLIP THAT ATTACHES THE TWO SHOULDER STRAPS TOGETHER AT THE CHEST (POSITIONING CLIP), WAS UP NEAR HIS NECK.  IF THE CAR RIDE HAD GONE ON MUCH LONGER, OR HE HAD WIGGLED ANY MORE, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN HANGING BY HIS NECK FROM THE CAR SEAT STRAPS.  NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT THE CAR SEAT HAD COMPLETELY FAILED AND IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT, HE WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED.  UPON FURTHER INSPECTION AND AFTER REMOVING THE CAR SEAT FROM THE CAR, WE REALIZED THAT THE BAR THAT HOLDS THE CROUCH STRAP ONTO THE BASE OF THE SEAT HAD COME LOOSE AND A SCREW WAS MISSING.  IT IS UNBELIEVABLE TO US THAT THIS VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY STRAP WAS ATTACHED BY TWO SCREWS THAT WERE NOT PERMANENTLY AFFIXED TO THE BASE!  WE HAVE YET TO FIND THE MISSING SCREW AND FEEL VERY LUCKY THAT OUR CHILD WASN'T HURT!  *NLM",
