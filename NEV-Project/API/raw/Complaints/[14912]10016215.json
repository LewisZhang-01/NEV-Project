THE VEHICLE DROPS SPEED WHILE DRIVING WITHOUT ANY INDICATIONS. VEHICLE STALLS IF THE AIR CONDITIONER IS TURNED ON WHEN THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE IS 75 DEGREES OR MORE. THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN GOING ON WITH THE CAR THREE WEEKS AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR MAY, 2002. AND TO DATE, APRIL 19, 2003, IT CONTINUES. THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN SERVICED NUMEROUS TIMES FOR THE DASH LIGHTS BLINKING WHICH ALSO CAUSED THE CAR TO STALL IN TRAFFIC WHEN TEMPERATURES ABOVE 75 DEGREES. DURING THE WINTER MONTHS THE CAR DID NOT HAVE STALLING PROBLEM, ONLY THE LIGHTS BLINKING. SINCE THE WEATHER IS GETTING WARMER, THE VEHICLE IS STALLING WITH THE ABOVE PROBLEMS AGAIN.    *JB",
