I DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY FRAME RECALL NOTICE BUT RECEIVED A SPARE TIRE LIFT PLATE RECALL (WHICH DOESN'T EXPIRE) DUE TO RUST AND SEVERE CORROSION. I WAS INFORMED BY DEALERSHIP MY TRUCK WAS UNSAFE TO EVEN PUT ON THE LIFT TO ADDRESS CURRENT RECALL, OF COURSE THEY LET ME DRIVE IT HOME WHICH IS A 35-40 MINUTE DRIVE FOR ME. I WAS FORCED TO SCRAP MY TRUCK WITH A PERFECTLY GOOD MOTOR BECAUSE HOW UNSAFE IT WAS AND THE EXPENSE TO FIX IT ON MY OWN. I DIDN'T REALIZE THE SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEM UNTIL I CRAWLED UNDER MY TRUCK AND WAS BESIDE MYSELF! I HAD HUGE HOLES IN THE FRAME, THE LEAF SPRINGS WERE SHOT, ALL THIS WAS UNDER THE \"UNDERCOATING\" THAT WAS DONE AT TIME OF PURCHASE TO PROTECT FRAME FROM RUST! I PAID EXTRA FOR THAT! EVEN MY SEAT MOUNTS ON THE INTERIOR BACK SEAT WERE RUSTED! I SUSPECT THE QUALITY OF METAL USED IS ON THE LOWER SIDE... I USED MY TRUCK AS A TRUCK, HAULED SMALL AMOUNTS OF MULCH, SOUL FOR MY GARDEN, IT MOVED ME 5X! I DIDN'T GO MUDDLING IN IT, PARK IT IN A POND, OR LIVE IN A FLOOD AREA. I JUST USED IT... HOW IS THERE AN EXPIRATION DATE FOR THE ONGOING PROBLEM THAT CAN ULTIMATELY JEAPARDIZE A PERSONS SAFETY AS WELL AS OTHERS ON THE ROAD?! PLEASE HOLD TOYOTA RESPONSIBLE...",
