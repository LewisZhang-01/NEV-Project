HIT SIDE CONCRETE BARRIER AT ABOUT 20-25 MPH, AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY, MY HUSBAND SMASHED THE WINDSHIELD WITH HIS HEAD AND GOT A CONCUSSION. ROAD WAS WET BUT HAD NO STANDING WATER, OUTSIDE TEMP MID TO UPPER 40'S. THIS APPEARS UNEXPLAINABLE BASED ON CONDITIONS- WE FEEL THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A MECHANICAL FAILURE, OTHERWISE SOMETHING WASN'T DESIGNED PROPERLY. NO CAR, ESPECIALLY WITH ANTI-LOCK BRAKES, SHOULD'VE REACTED THIS WAY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.  WE HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN THE VEHICLE AND PLAN TO GET RID OF IT IMMEDIATELY.  *JB    ****DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****769310",
