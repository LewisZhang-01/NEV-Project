I HAD A CRACKED FRAME ABOUT 2 FEET FORWARD OF WHERE FROM SUSPENSION FOR REAR TIRES MEET FRAME.  CRACKED FRAME COMPLETELY AND WHEN BED WAS REMOVED CAUSE TRUCK TO COLLAPSE AND BE IMMOVEABLE UNTIL FRAME WAS SIMPLY PATCHED TO BE MOVED. HAD TO JUNK TRUCK DUE TO CONDITION AND REPAIR COSTS WERE MORE THAN TRUCK WAS WORTH. VERY UPSET WITH 2000 FORD RANGER I PURCHASED.  SPENT ALOT OF MONEY AND DIDNT EVEN GET A YEAR OUT OF TRUCK.  NEVER USED TO TOW OR AS WORK TRUCK. NEVER MORE THAN 200 POUNDS IN BED AND STILL HAD FRAME PROBLEMS. SOME THING IS VERY WRONG WITH FORD RANGER FRAMES. WHEN WILL SOMETHING BE DONE .  I MAY NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER FORD VEHICLE DUE TO THIS UNFORTUNATE BUT ALL TOO COMMON FRAME FAILURE. *TR",
