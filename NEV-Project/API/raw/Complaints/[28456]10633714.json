        "summary": "WITHIN THE INITIAL 12K MILES OF OWNING THIS JX35, WE'VE EXPERIENCED A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THE JX35 PASSENGER AIR BAG INDICATOR LIGHT.  MY WIFE IS APPROX. 130 LBS. AND THE LIGHT COMES ON NUMEROUS TIMES INDICATING THAT THE AIRBAG WILL NOT FUNCTION DURING AN ACCIDENT.  THIS IS A SERIOUS AND SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE WHICH NISSAN HAS BEEN UNABLE TO FIX.  IT'S BEEN RECALLED TWICE AND HAS BEEN TO THE DEALERSHIP OVER FIVE (5) TIMES FOR THIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM.  IT IS CURRENTLY AT THE DEALERSHIP AND WE'VE TOLD THEM TO BUY BACK THE CAR.  WE HAVE FILED A FORMAL COMPLIANT WITH NISSAN CUSTOMER  AFFAIRS, COMPLAINT # 15766361, AND WILL AWAIT THEIR COMMENTS.  IF THAT FAILS, WE WILL ENACT THE TEXAS LEMON LAW TO HAVE THE CAR RETURNED.      JUST TODAY, THE SERVICE DIRECTOR SAID THEY WERE ABLE TO REPLICATE THE ISSUE WHEN ONE OF THEIR FEMALE SERVICE TECHNICIANS RODE IN THE PASSENGER FRONT SEAT, SITTING SIDEWAYS ON 1/2 OF THE SEAT.  THEN, THEY WENT ON TO SAY THE LIGHT DID IN FACT COME ON, CAME TO A RED LIGHT, WAITED SEVEN SECONDS AND THE LIGHT WENT OFF.  THEY SAID IF THIS HAPPENS, YOU SHOULD COME TO A COMPLETE STOP SO THAT IT RECALIBRATES ITSELF.  I ASKED IF THEY THOUGHT THIS WAS NORMAL.  THEY SAID, \"YES\".  I THEN ASKED, IF THE LIGHT IS ON, AND SOMEONE HITS THE FRONT END OF OUR CAR AND MY OCCUPANT SUFFERS DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY, DO I THEN GET MY \"SEVEN SECONDS\" BACK BEFORE THE CRASH TO RESET THE SEAT?  COMPLETE AND UTTER NONSENSE.  THESE DEALERS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS CAR.  THEY ARE PUTTING ALL OF US AT RISK WHO USE THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT.    THEY HAD THE AUDACITY TO ACCUSE MY WIFE OF NOT SITTING PROPERLY IN THE SEAT.  HOW SEXIST!  NO OTHER VEHICLE WE'VE OWNED OR RENTED HAS EVER DEMONSTRATED THIS ISSUE.  THIS CAR IS A LEMON AND NISSAN MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.  NHTSA TESTS THE CAR WITH AIRBAGS, OUR CAR DOESN'T HAVE THAT WORKS CORRECTLY AND THEY REFUSE TO FIX IT.   *TR",
