THE TRIP WAS 1,000 MILES ROUND TRIP AND IT USED 2 1/2 QUARTS OF OIL. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS NORMAL TO USE THAT MUCH OIL. AND THEY CHANGED THE OIL TO A DIFFERENT WEIGHT TO DO A TEST ON OIL CONSUMPTION. IT STILL USES OIL AND NOW THE MOTOR SMOKES WHEN YOU FIRST START IT UP. AND IF IT SITS FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS IT WILL KNOW LOUD WHEN YOU START IT. THE FOR D DEALER SAID THIS IS NORMAL.   *NLM",
