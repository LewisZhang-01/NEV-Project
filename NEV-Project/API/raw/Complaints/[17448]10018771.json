        "summary": "I PURCHASED A USED 1999 PLYMOUTH VOYAGER.  WHEN I TOOK IT TO A DEALER IN CARLSBAD, CA.  BOB BAKER, I ASKED ABOUT TWO PROBLEMS I HAVE WITH IT.  THE HORN DOESN'T HONK, AND THE AIR BAY LIGHT STAYS ON ALL THE TIME.  I WAS TOLD THEY'D BE FIXED FREE.  WHEN THEY CALLED REGARDING OTHER REPAIRS, THEY SAID THE ITEMS WOULDN'T BE FIXED FREE, THAT MY PARTICULAR 1999 PLYMOUTH VOYAGER WASN'T INCLUDED IN A RECALL.  I OBJECTED AND ALSO FOUND THE REPAIR COSTS EXPENSIVE FOR ME, AND I WAS TOLD TO GO AHEAD AND PAY TO HAVE IT FIXED, THAT \"THERE WILL BE A RECALL COMING UP AND WHEN IT DOES I CAN SHOW THE RECEIPTS AND GET A REFUND.\"  WHY ARE SOME 1999 INCLUDED AND OTHERS NOT, WHEN THEY HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS OTHERS ARE FIXED FOR UNDER RECALL?  ALSO THE LOW FUEL BELL RINGS AFTER YOU FILL THE TANK UNTIL THE TANK LEVEL GETS DOWN TO ABOUT 3/4 TANK. ( IT DOES RING WHEN THE FUEL IS LOW, TOO).  I WANT MY HORN FIXED, IT'S AN IMPORTANT SAFETY FEATURE.  ALSO THE LIGHT \"SERVICE ENGINE SOON\" CAME ON, AND I JUST HAD A TUNE UP, ETC.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN TO A REPAIR SHOP BECAUSE THE DEALERSHIP COSTS SO MUCH AND IT COST ME $58.00 TO FIND OUT THAT THE GAS CAP WASN'T SEALING PROPERLY.  THE NEW CAP I BOUGHT IS IMPRINTED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT IT HAVING TO BE PLACED ON PROPERLY.  THIS NEW CAP I BELIEVE IS IMPRINTED THIS WAY BECAUSE OF A PROBLEM THAT CAME UP.  I AM DISGUSTED AND \"BROKE\" AFTER HAVING TO PAY FOR SUCH A DIAGNOSIS AND THEN 15.65 FOR THE NEW CAP. *JB",
