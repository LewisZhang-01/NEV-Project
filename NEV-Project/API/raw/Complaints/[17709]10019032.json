THE JACK THAT CAME WITH THE CAR ARE \"SCISSOR-TYPE\" AND HAS ONLY BEEN USED TWICE.   SO, THE CAR WAS LIFTED ON ONE SIDE AND I PROCEEDED TO TAKE OFF THE FRONT TIRE. ALL OF THE SUDDEN, THE JACK GAVE WAY AND THE CAR CAME DOWN. LUCKILY THE FRONT TIRE WAS HALFWAY IN THE WHEEL-WELL, SO THE CAR JUST SETTLED ON THE TIRE WITH THE ROTOR PUSHING AGAINST THE INSIDE OF THE RIM (I NOTICED SCRATCHES INSIDE THE RIM AFTER I REMOVED THE TIRE).  WELL, I TOOK A CLOSER LOOK AT THE JACK AND SAW THAT THE BIG, LONG SCREW BROKE IN HALF. I JUST COULDN'T IMAGINE THAT THE JACK VOLVO GIVES OUT WITH THEIR CARS WOULD SIMPLY BREAK, ESPECIALLY IF EVERYTHING WAS DONE PROPERLY. THE CAR WAS EMPTY, SO WEIGHT COULDN'T BE AN ISSUE.   THERE WAS SOME LOWER BODY PANEL DAMAGE FROM THE JACK WHEN IT BROKE.  ALSO, MY FINGERS GOT BRUISED AND SCRATCHED UP A BIT FROM THE IMPACT OF THE CAR FALLING ON THE FRONT TIRE THAT I WAS REMOVING AT THE TIME.   *NLM",
