THE VW DEALER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THESE HAVE BEEN FAILING OFTEN BUT REFUSED TO REPLACE THE OTHER TWO COILS EVEN THOUGH THEY ADMITTED THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO FAIL THAN THE NEWER REPLACEMENT UNITS (OLD UNITS HAVE PART NUMBER H, NEW ARE J).  WE HAVE REPEATEDLY CONTACTED THE VOLKSWAGON NATIONAL CONSUMER CARE NUMBER AND THEY HAVE LIED TO US ABOUT CONTACTING OUR DEALER (OUR REPAIR WAS DELAYED BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY CALLED BUT DIDN'T).  WE ARE AFRAID TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE BECAUSE OF THE HIGH RISK OF GETTING STRANDED OR WORSE IN AN ACCIDENT.  (NOTE:  INCIDENT DATE IS JAN 2 2003 NOT 2002, BUT IT'S NOT AN AVAILABLE OPTION)",
