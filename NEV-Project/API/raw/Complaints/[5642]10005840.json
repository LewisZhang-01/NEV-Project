        "summary": "I AM THE OWNER OF A 2001 GMC (4-DOOR) EXTENDED CAB PICK UP (SHORT BED). THE TRUCK CAME EQUIPPED WITH GOODYEAR WRANGLER TIRES. THE DOT CODE FOR THE TIRES IS AS FOLLOWS: DOT M63D EKWR 4200 (TIRES 0715, 0801, 1131, 1132). THE TIRES HAVE APPROXIMATELY 18,500 MILES ON THEM. THEY HAVE BEEN REGULARLY SERVICED - AIR PRESSURE CHECKS AND ROTATION. THE SUBJECT TIRES HAVE VERY VERY POOR WET WEATHER TRACTION. I CONSIDERED THEM DANGEROUS SO THEY WERE REPLACED. IT SEEMS TO BE RATHER COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT THESE TIRES HAVE POOR WET TRACTION. I DRAW THIS CONCLUSION BY MY CONVERSATION WITH A GOODYEAR DEALER AND POSTINGS ON THE INTERNET AT TIRERACK.COM AND DISCOUNTTIRE.COM (WHERE PEOPLE COMMENT.) GM AND/OR GOODYEAR SHOULD CONSIDER HAVING BETTER WET WEATHER TRACTION FOR THE APPLICATION.",
