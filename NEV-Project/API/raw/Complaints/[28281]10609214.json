HE FOUND A U-SHAPED CHUNK OF METAL ON THE GROUND AFTER THE FRONT SUSPENSION COIL HAD CRACKED COMPLETELY CLEAN IN HALF. THE MECHANIC HAD TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE FRONT SUSPENSION SYSTEM AS IT APPEARED TO HAVE THE BEGINNINGS OF A CRACK IN THE COIL ON THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL. FORTUNATELY, IT DID NOT HAPPEN WHILE DRIVING AT ANY SPEED.  THE MECHANIC SAID HE WAS SURPRISED THAT THE DEALER HAD THE PARTS IN STOCK, MAKING ME THINK THIS MIGHT BE A COMMON PROBLEM. I REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO NISSAN AS WELL.   *TR",
