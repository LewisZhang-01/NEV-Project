THE FIRST ACCIDENT OCCURED IN NOVEMBER 2002 AND IN THAT ACCIDENT TWO OTHER AUTOS WERE INVOLVED.  IN BOTH ACCIDENTS THE BRAKES DID NOT ENGAGE EVEN THOUGH I STEPPED ON THE BRAKES HARD.  I TOLD THE DEALER (KOON'S FORD IN FALLS CHURCH, VA) ON BOTH OCCASIONS THAT THE BRAKES DID NOT ENGAGE PROPERLY.  THEY TOLD ME NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE BRAKES.   I FELT SO SCARED DRIVING MY WINDSTAR THAT I JUST TRADED IT IT AT A BIG LOSS (US$4,000 TRADE IN) FOR A NEW 2003 TOYOTA SEQUOA. I TOOK POSSESSION OF MY NEW AUTO TODAY 1/18/03).    THE BRAKES SIMPLY DID NOT ENGAGE ON THESE TWO OCCASIONS.  WHILE THEY WORKED FINE AT OTHER TIMES.  THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO.",
