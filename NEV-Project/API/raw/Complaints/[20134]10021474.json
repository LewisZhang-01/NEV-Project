WE HAVE ALWAYS FOLLOWED HONDA'S RECOMMENDED MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE, AND THUS TOOK THE CAR TO THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP. THEY HAVE SEEN THE CAR FOR THIS PROBLEM 3 TIMES, REPLACING THE SEALS AT LEAST ONCE. THEY NOW ADVISE US THAT BY DIAGNOSING THE SYMPTOMS (THEY CANNOT DISSEMBLE THE TRANSMISSION) THEY FEEL THE LEAKING IS DUE TO WORN DIFFERENTIAL BEARINGS AND THE ONLY SOLUTION IS A NEW TRANSMISSION. WE HAVE REPORTED TO HONDA NORTH AMERICAN WHO ADVISES THEY CAN DO NOTHING AS THIS IS A MAINTENANCE PROBLEM. IF SO, WHY WASN'T THIS CAUGHT DURING ONE OF THE MANY VISITS TO THE DEALERSHIP? WHEN THE PROBLEMS BEGAN, THIS CAR ONLY HAD 75,000 MILES ON IT. WITH THE LEAK, THERE HAS ALSO BEEN CLUNKING AND SLOPPING SHIFTING, ALMOST SINCE THE FIRST DAY WE OWNED THE CAR.   *JB",
