        "summary": "I PREVIOUSLY OWNED A 1998 EXPLORER THAT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM I AM HAVING WITH MY 2000 EXPLORER. FROM TALKING WITH THE FORD DEALER MECHANIC, THIS IS A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM THAT IS OCCURRING AFTER 30,000 MILES THAT IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION. THE PROBLEM IS UPON STARTUP OF THE VEHICLE, THE ENGINE WILL CRANK, AND WHEN THE IGNITION KEY IS RELEASED, THE ENGINE DIES IMMEDIATELY. THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP THE ENGINE RUNNING IS TO KEEP ONE FOOT ON THE GAS PEDAL DEPRESSED.  TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE ONE FOOT MUST BE ON THE GAS AND ONE ON THE BRAKE TO KEEP THE ENGINE FROM STALLING. THIS IS  PRESENTING A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION AND FORD IS QUITE AWARE OF IT,  BUT DOING NOTHING IN THE FORM OF A RECALL OR SAFETY BULLETIN TO CONSUMERS. FORTUNATELY MY 1998 FIRST FAILED UNDER WARRANTY, BUT MY 2000 HAPPENED AFTER MY 36,000 MILE WARRANTY. THE PROBLEM OCCURS INTERMITTENTLY BUT FREQUENT AT TIMES, AFTER DRIVING SEVERAL MILES, IT WOULD CORRECT ITSELF.   I THINK FORD NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AND DO ANY REPAIRS AT NO COST TO THE OWNER. *PH       *JB    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**766061",
