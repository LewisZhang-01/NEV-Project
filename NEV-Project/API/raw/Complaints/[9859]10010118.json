THE REASON FOR THE RECALL, THE THROTTLE CABLE PULL OUT, ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO ME AND NEARLY CAUSED AN ACCIDENT.  NHTSA# 94V035000  REFERRAL CARFAX.COM INFORMED ME OF THE RECALL WHEN I PAID FOR A HISTORY ON MY VEHICLE BEFORE SELLING IT.  THIS STILL HASN'T BEEN FIXED.  CAN I STILL ASK THE DEALER TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM?*JB",
