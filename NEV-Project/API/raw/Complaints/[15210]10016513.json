        "summary": "I HAVE A 96 626 THAT HAS 125,000 MILES.  I PURCHASED MY CAR IN 98 WITH 60,000 MILES.  IN MAY OF 2000 I HAD TO REPLACE THE OXYGEN SENSOR.  I HAVE ALSO HAD TO REPLACE THE LEFT FRONT AXEL AND THE RIGHT CV JOINT BOOT IN FEB. 2003.  NOW I HAVE REPLACE MY ENTIRE TRANSMISSION WHICH IS GOING TO COST AROUND 2300.  I HAD NO INDICATIONS THAT I  HAD TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS UNTIL IT JUST QUIT.  ON MY WAY TO WORK MY CAR JUST STOPPED MOVING ON THE INTERSTATE.  WHEN I PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR IT WOULDN'T PULL.  SO I GOT OFF THE ROAD SAFELY AND ATTEMPTED TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.  THE CAR WAS NOT MOVING FORWARD OR BACKWARDS.  I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO THE TRANSMISSION SHOP TO BE TOLD THE WONDERFUL NEWS.  I HAVE BEEN DOING RESEARCH AND I'M FINDING THIS CAR HAS LOTS OF PROBLEMS. I AM ALSO HAVING PROBLEMS WITH OIL LEAKING AND OCCASIONALLY THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL APPEARS TO BE HARD TO PRESS AS IF IT'S STUCK FOR A FEW MINUTES OR IT'S REAL TIGHT.   I WOULD NOT ADVISE ANYONE TO PURCHASE A MAZDA.  DON'T EVEN TAKE IT IF IT'S FREE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE CHEAPER TO PURCHASE A CAR.  I REALIZE MY CAR HAS 125,000 MILES BUT I HAD A NISSAN THAT I DROVE 180,000 MILES FOR BEFORE MAJOR PROBLEMS OCCURRED.  I'M FILING THIS COMPLAINT IN HOPES SOMETHING CAN BE DONE BECAUSE THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM.            *JB",
