THE PROBLEM MAKES TURNING TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT ON DARK OR POORLY LIGHT ROADS VERY DIFFICULT AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO SEE PEOPLE AND OBJECTS TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT ON ROADS AT NIGHT.  SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASING THE AUTO, I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER TO CHECK THE FRONT HEADLIGHTS.  THE DEALER SAID THE HEADLIGHTS WERE PROPERLY ALIGNED.  I THEN TOOK THE AUTO TO A SERVICE STATION THAT ALSO DOES VIRGINIA SAFETY INSPECTIONS TO CHECK ONLY THE HEADLIGHTS.  THE SERVICE STATION TECHNICIAN SAID THE HEADLIGHTS WERE PROPERLY ALIGNED.  THE HEADLIGHTS DID NOT AND DO NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LIGHT TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT OF THE AUTO!!!   *JB",
