SUMMER 2011 ACCELERATION POWER ISSUES/SHAKING. TOOK CAR TO DEALERSHIP (NORTH POINT NISSAN IN LITTLE ROCK). REPLACED RECALLED PART (RELAY SWITCH) BUT REFUSED TO EXAMINE POWER/SLIPPAGE/HEATING  ISSUES BECAUSE THE DIAGNOSTICS REPORTED I HAD A BAD BATTERY. DID NOT PLACE ONE OF THEIR BATTERIES INTO MY PATHFINDER TO FIND PROBLEM BUT SENT ME ON MY WAY TO GET A NEW BATTERY. ALSO TELLING ME THAT BAD BATTERIES CAUSE CARS TO DO CRAZY THINGS  AT O'REILLY'S AUTO STORE THEY TESTED MY NEW BATTERY AND IT TESTED FINE. UNBEKNOWNST TO ME ALL OF THE SIGNS MY CAR WAS EXHIBITING WERE THE TELL TELL SIGNS OF THE RADIATOR/TRANSMISSION DEFECT. I AM STILL UNSURE WHY THEY DID NOT PICK UP THE SYMPTOMS AND PROPERLY DIAGNOSE MY AUTOMOBILE. PROBLEMS PERSISTED... THE NEXT WINTER SAME ISSUE... MORE COOLANT. IN JUNE 2012 MY PATHFINDER WOULD NOT START...DIAGNOSED WITH TRANSMISSION RADIATOR ISSUE THAT THOUSANDS HAVE EXPERIENCED. NISSAN SENT A WARRANTY EXTENSION TO MOST OWNERS OF PATHFINDERS. MY PATHFINDER WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS EXTENSION ...???? FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY BELIEVED THIS DEFECT DID NOT APPLY TO CERTAIN BATCHES. HAD NISSAN SENT ME A WARRANTY EXTENSION I WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY TAKEN MY CAR TO BE REPAIRED. AS IT STANDS NOW MY PATHFINDER SITS WAITING.. PLEASE HOLD NISSAN ACCOUNTABLE.  *TR",
