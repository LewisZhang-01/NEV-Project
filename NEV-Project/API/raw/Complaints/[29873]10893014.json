IT HAD NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE AND I ONLY HAD THE CAR FOR LESS THAN A YEAR. I JUST THANK GOD NO ONE WAS HURT. I TOOK MY CAR TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THAT IT WAS NOT APART OF THE RECALL, BUT IN MY OPINION IF IT HAS BEEN A ISSUE FOR SEVERAL VEHICLE FIX ALL OF THEM. THEY SAID THE CAR WAS FINE BUT WHEN THE MECHANIC GOT IN MY CAR HE HAD A HARD TIME TURNING THE WHEEL.",
