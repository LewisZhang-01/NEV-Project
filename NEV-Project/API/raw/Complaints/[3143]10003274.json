I WAS TOLD THAT THE TWO COILS THAT FAILED WERE GOING TO BE REPLACED, BUT WITH THAT CAME A WARNING THAT I HAVE A TOTAL OF 6 COILS. WHEN I PICKED UP MY PARTIALY FIXED VAN I WAS TOLD \" HOPEFULLY WE CAN REPLACE ALL YOUR COILS BEFORE THIS HAPPENS TO YOU AGAIN.\" WHEN I CONTACTED VW DIRECTLY THEY INFORMED ME THAT THIS WAS A LARGE PROBLEM THEY WERE HAVING COMPANY WIDE & AT THIS TIME THEY WERE ONLY REPLACING THE FAILED FAULITY COILS. AT THE DEALERSHIP WHEN I ASKED IF THIS COULD CAUSE ENGINE DAMAGE I WAS TOLD \"IT COULD\".I WAS SOLD A NEW CAR WITHOUT THE KNOWLADGE OF SERIOUS FAULTY PROBLEMS THAT VW CLEARLY KNEW ABOUT. I WOULD LIKE MY NEW CAR TO NOT HAVE ANY KNOWN DEFECTS. ALL 6 COILS SHOULD BE REPLACE, FOR THE SAFTY OF MY CHILDREN, MY HUSBAND, & MYSELF.",
