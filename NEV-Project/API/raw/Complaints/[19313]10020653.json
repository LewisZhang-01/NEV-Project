WE HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH BRITAX CHILD SAFETY AND THEY HAVE TOLD US IT IS NOT A SAFETY CONCERN.  THEY TOLD US THAT THE SEAT WAS PUT IN TOO TIGHT AND THAT THE PREASURE CAUSED THE SPLIT.  EACH REPRESENTATIVE WE SPOKE WITH WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEM, LEADING US TO BELIEVE IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM.  WE WERE FORCED TO PURCHASE ANOTHER SEAT BECAUSE I CONSIDER IT A SAFETY ISSUE.  THE SEAT IS STILL UNDER WARENTY.      BRITAX ROUNDABOUT  MODEL# E900212",
