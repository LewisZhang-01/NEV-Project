THERE WAS PRETTY HEAVY RAINFALL, SO I MADE SURE TO STAY AROUND 25 MILES/HR.  AS I PASSED THE DEALERSHIP I HEARD A THUNDEROUS BOOM FROM THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY CAR.  I MADE IT BACK TO MY HOUSE (WHICH IS LESS THAN A MILE AWAY).  WHEN I GOT OUT OF MY CAR, I FOUND THE FRONT OF MY FRONT RIGHT RIM BENT, AND THE INSIDE OF THE RIM WAS MISSING AN 8 INCH CHUNK OF METAL NEAR THE SEAL.  I TOOK IT DOWN TO THE DEALERSHIP THE NEXT DAY ONLY TO HEAR THEM TELL ME THAT DAMAGE WAS NORMAL IN REGULAR ROAD CONDITIONS.  THE ONLY OPTION I WAS GIVEN WAS TO BUY A NEW RIM (AT ABOUT $350).  THIS WAS EVEN WITH THE EXTENDED 100,000 MILE WARRANTY ON THE VEHICLE.",
