THESE TIRES WERE 21 MONTHS OLD, WITH APPROXIMATELY 45,000 MILES ON THEM. THEY WERE ROTATED EVERY 3000 MILES, THE CAR WAS ALIGNED EVERY SIX MONTHS AND I CHECKED THE PRESSURE REGULARLY. I HAD  A TREAD SEPARATION WITH MY PREVIOUS COOPER  30X950R15. THE DEALER SAID MY LOAD WAS EXCESSIVE FOR THE TIRE SO I WEIGHED MY TRUCK AND HE RECOMMENDED THE 1050R15S. THE SUBURBAN DID A GREAT JOB OF CRADLING US AND FORTUNATELY WE DIDN'T HIT ANYTHING ON OUR TUMBLE AND SLIDE INTO THE MEDIAN.   *NLM",
