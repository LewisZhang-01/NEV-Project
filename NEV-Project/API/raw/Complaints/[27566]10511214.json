        "summary": "2013 FORD FIESTA BOUGHT 11/23/12. PROBLEMS WITHIN 4 DAYS; IT'S DEFINITELY A DEATH TRAP. TO REPAIR SHOP 11/27/12, 11/30/12, 12/12/12 & 03/27/13 FOR INTERMITTENT PROBLEMS. INITIALLY STARTED HEARING A BUZZING FROM RIGHT SIDE OF MOTOR & SMELLING SOMETHING HOT LIKE RUBBER BURNING. THE ORIGINAL PROBLEMS WERE JOINED WITH A GRINDING NOISE FROM THE TRANSMISSION AREA ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CAR (LOUDEST BETWEEN 32 & 42 MPH), IT BEGAN TO HESITATE, SHUTTER, STALL, LURCH, NOT MOVE FORWARD UNTIL HIGH RPMS REACHED & THEN IT SUDDENLY LUNGED FORWARD. DIFFICULTY PULLING STEEP HILLS/DRIVEWAYS & DOESN'T REVERSE AT TIMES. WE'VE NEARLY BEEN REAR-ENDED & BROADSIDED ON MORE THAN ONCE; I ALMOST REAR-ENDED SOMEONE ELSE. CRUISE CONTROL PROBLEM ON INTERSTATE COULD HAVE GOTTEN MY FAMILY KILLED; TAPPED BRAKES TO DISENGAGE CRUISE CONTROL AS I WAS BEING PASSED ON ONE SIDE & WAS APPROACHING A SLOW MOVING VEHICLE. I PULLED TO THE LEFT LANE & PROCEEDED PAST THE SLOWER VEHICLE BUILDING MY SPEED BACK UP TO 70; I PUSHED THE RESUME BUTTON & SUDDENLY THE CAR'S SPEED DROPPED DRASTICALLY & THEN JUMPED BACK UP CAUSING THE RPMS TO REV VERY HIGH BEFORE RETURNING TO NORMAL. THANKFULLY NO ONE WAS BEHIND ME; IF IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN THE OTHER LANE WE WOULD HAVE BEEN HIT BY A SEMI-TRUCK.  THE CAR CONTINUES TO DEVELOP MORE PROBLEMS EACH DAY. IN APRIL 2013, THE CAR WAS PARKED ON A LEVEL STORE LOT. MY SON HAD JUST ENTERED THE CAR & I WAS GETTING IN THE DRIVER'S SIDE. I HAD JUST GOT MY BUTT ON THE SEAT & MY RIGHT LEG IN THE CAR WHEN I HEAR A CLICKING NOISE, THEN THE CAR STARTED TO ROLL FORWARD; I IMMEDIATELY JERKED MY LEFT LEG IN & INSTINCTIVELY PRESSED THE BRAKE & REACHED FOR THE GEAR SHIFT THINKING I FORGOT IT IN GEAR BUT TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS IN PARK. NOW I ALWAYS PULL THE EMERGENCY BRAKE & AT HOME FOR ADDED SAFETY I PUT A BLOCK IN FRONT OF THE TIRE ALSO.  *TR",
