I KNOW MY AFFECT PART IS ENGINE, BUT MY HUSBAND & I CAR IS FALLING APART. WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO HAVE IT FIX. THE ENGINE IS THE LAST PROBLEM WE HAVE HAD SO FAR.IT STALL IF YOU GO TOO FAST AROUND 55. IT STALL ALL THE TIME.  MY HUSBAND STOP AT A RED LIGHT IT CUT OFF. I BELIEVE THE COMPANY SHOULD PAY FOR THE PROBLEMS. THEY HAD NO PROBLEM ASKING FOR A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM US. BOTH OF THE PROBLEMS I STATED ARE DANGEROUS. PLEASE HELP IN DOING SOMETHING.  *TR",
