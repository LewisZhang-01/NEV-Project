I UNDERSTAND THE SUDDEN DOWNSHIFTING HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO NOT BE A SAFETY HAZARD, BUT IN THIS CASE THE TRANSMISSION WOULD NOT ENGAGE ANY GEAR WHILE SHIFTING BETWEEN SECOND AND THIRD.    THE RESULTING SUDDEN LOSS OF DRIVE POWER ALMOST CAUSED THE CAR BEHIND ME TO HIT ME.   THE 2-3 SHIFT IS ALMOST ALWAYS UNDER HEAVY ACCELERATION AWAY FROM A DEAD STOP, TO DEEM THIS NOT A SAFETY HAZARD IS ABSURD.   IF I WERE NOT ABLE TO PULL TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD I WOULD HAVE BEEN HIT.    ACURA DEALERS HAVE DENIED KNOWLEDGE OF THIS ISSUE UNTIL THE TRANSMISSION ACTUALLY FAILS.   I TOLERATED 20,000 MILES OF ERRATIC SHIFTING BEFORE MINE DIED COMPLETELY.   I NOW HAVE 4,000 ON THE NEW TRANSMISSION AND IT HAS BEEN EXHIBITING THE SAME BEHAVIOR THE ORIGINAL DID, ALWAYS BETWEEN THE 2-3 SHIFT.",
