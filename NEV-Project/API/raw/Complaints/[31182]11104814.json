        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING ON A STATE RD WITH MY TODDLER WHEN UNEXPECTEDLY THE CAR BEGAN TO ABRUPTLY SLOW DOWN. I WAS ALMOST REAR ENDED BY ANOTHER CAR THAT SWERVED TO AVOID HITTING ME. THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON WITH A MESSAGE ENGINE POWER REDUCED, TRACTION CONTROL OFF, STABILITRACK NEEDS SERVICING. I WAS IN THE MIDDLE LANE AND WITH CARS FLYING BY IT WAS TERRYING TRYING TO PULL OFF SAFELY. THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT INCREASE IN SPEED WHEN I PRESS DOWN ON THE ACCELERATOR. AFTER PULLING OFF I IMMEDIATELY TURNED THE ENGINE OFF WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND TRIED TO START THE ENGINE AGAIN BUT RECEIVED THE SAME MESSAGES. WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN GEAR IT STRUGGLED TO MOVE. I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AGAIN AND THEN WAITED 10 MINUTES. UPON RESTARTING THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON BUT NO OTHER MESSAGES WERE DISPLAYED. I WAS ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE HOME AND TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP ON 3/30/17. WHEN I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS NO LONGER ON. THE SERVICE ADVISORS CALLED A FEW DAYS LATER AND STATED THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. THEY ONLY NOTED THAT THE ENGINE MOUNT NEEDED REPLACEMENT AND THIS COULD POSSIBLY HAVE CAUSED THE PROBLEM. MY VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY SO I PAID BELIEVING THIS WOULD SOLVE THE ISSUE. UNFORTUNATELY IT HAPPENED AGAIN DRIVING ON A CITY RD AND I WAS NEARLY STRUCK FROM BEHIND AGAIN AND STRUGGLED TO SAFELY GET OFF THE ROAD. THIS TIME MY HUSBAND AND 2 OTHER CHILDREN WERE IN THE VEHICLE. I WAS ABLE TO TAKE PICTURES OF THE SAME DASH NOTIFICATIONS AND AFTER GETTING IT STARTED I DROVE IT STRAIGHT TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP ON 3/17/18. I SHOWED THEM THE PICS AND WAS ADAMANT I WOULD NOT GET IN THE CAR AGAIN UNLESS IT WAS FIXED. THEY ASSURED ME IT WOULD BE FIXED THIS TIME. A FEW DAYS LATER THEY STATED THE FUEL PUMP FUEL LINES AND FUEL PRESSURE SENSOR HAD TO BE REPLACED. AFTER MY SECOND EXPERIENCE I FOUND SEVERAL SIMILAR COMPLAINTS. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RECALLED.",
