THIS HAS HAPPEN APPROXIMATELY (3) TIMES ON THE ROAD AND (3) TIMES PARKED. WHILE ON THE ROAD IT WILL BE ANOTHER DRIVER WHO WILL SIGNAL THAT IT IS AJAR OR IN ONE CASE IT WAS A GAS STATION ATTENDANT (STILL ATTENDANT SERVICE IN NEW JERSEY!). ONE TIME THE TRUNK WAS FOUND AJAR IN THE MORNING AT A MOTEL STOP (NOTHING TAKEN), AND A COUPLE OF TIMES IT WAS FOUND OPEN WHILE PARKED IN THE GARAGE.  ON THIS AUTOMOBILE, 2001 TOYOTA AVALON, THE TRUNK OPENER IS ON THE DASH AND IS ELECTRONIC WHILE THE GAS CAP OPENER IS ON THE FLOOR AND IS MECHANICAL SO THERE CAN BE NO MISTAKING THE TWO. BECAUSE THIS HAS HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES, I WILL LIST THE MOST RECENT DATE AS THE \"INCIDENT DATE\". THANK YOU.*JB",
