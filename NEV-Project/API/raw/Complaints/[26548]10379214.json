THIS HAPPENS ON AT ANY GAS STATION AND LEAVES GAS ALL DOWN THE SIDE OF THE JEEP AND ON THE GROUND.   I NOW ONLY GET GAS WHEN THE LIGHT COMES ON AND I CAN GUESS ON HOW MUCH GAS I NEED. AT FILL UP, I PUT THE PUMP TO AUTOMATIC SHUT OFF UNTIL I ESTIMATE I AM 2 GALLONS SHORT. I THEN FINISH OFF MANUALLY AT THE LOWEST FLOW RATE. THIS IS NOT A GUARANTEE TO WORK.",
