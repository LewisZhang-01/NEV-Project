        "summary": "DURING A SNOW EVENT ON JAN 3, 2015, MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS STOPPED WORKING ALL TOGETHER (IT WAS SNOWING AND ABOUT 36 DEGREES).  I COULD HEAR A CLICK COMING FROM BELOW THE FUSE BOX, BUT THEY WERE NOT WORKING SO I HAD NO VISIBILITY AND HAD TO PULL OVER.  I PULLED THE FUSE FROM THE BLOCK THINK MAYBE IT SOMEHOW BECAME LOOSE AND REPLACED (WITH THE SAME) AND THE WIPERS STARTED WORKING AGAIN.  I CONTINUED ON WITH MY DAY.  ON JAN. 6, DURING ANOTHER SNOW EVENT, THE SAME THING HAPPENED AS I PULLED OUT OF A 40 DEGREE GARAGE.  THIS TIME I COULD NOT GET THEM TO START WORKING SO I NEEDED TO HAVE IT TOWED TO A GARAGE.  THIS IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY, AND SO FAR THE EVALUATION HAS BEEN THAT THE WIPERS ARE NOW WORKING, BUT THERE IS A CODE DISPLAYED THAT THE WIPERS HAD A FAULT, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO REPLACE.  I SURE HOPE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN WHEN I'M ON A HIGHWAY GOING 65 MPH NEXT TO A TRUCK THROWING UP ROAD SALT ONTO MY WINDSHIELD.  *TR",
