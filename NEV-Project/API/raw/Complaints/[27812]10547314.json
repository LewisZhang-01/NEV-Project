        "summary": "THE OTHER DAY I SMELLED GAS IN MY GARAGE. THE SMELL IS BAD UNTIL THE FUEL LEVEL DROPS BELOW 1/2 TANK. I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAID THEY CANNOT FIND A LEAK. I MENTIONED IF THIS IS COVERED UNDER THE 80K MILE EMISSION WARRANTY AND THEY SAID IT WAS NOT. THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THE SOLUTION IS TO DROP THE TANKS BECAUSE THE ISSUE MAY LIE IN THE FUEL PUMP AND LEAKING TANKS ON THE TOP. I BELIEVE THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE REGARDING LEAKING FUEL TANKS AND THE CONSUMER SHOULD NOT PAY FOR A FAULTY ITEM BEING A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. I KNOW THIS WAS AN ISSUE ON THE C5 CORVETTE AND GM REPLACED THOSE TANKS FREE OF CHARGE. THE C6 FUEL CELL IS THE SAME AS THE C5 AND IT APPEARS LIKE ITS ALSO FAULTY AS WELL. PLEASE REVIEW ALL C6 CORVETTES (2005-2013) COMPLAINTS ON THIS SITE.  THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL OR A FIX BY GM TO COVER THE COSTS.  *TR",
