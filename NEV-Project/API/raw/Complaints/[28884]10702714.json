CONTACTED THE CLOSEST DEALER SHIP AS INSTRUCTED IN THE LETTER; WAS TOLD AT THAT TIME IT WOULD TAKE TWO WEEKS TO GET THE PARTS IN.    WHEN I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AFTER THE TWO WEEK WAIT, I WAS INFORMED THAT THE PARTS WHERE ON BACK ORDER AND I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT MY TURN.   CONTACTED AMERICAN HONDA OVER THIS AND WAS TOLD THAT PARTS COULD BE RE-ROUTED TO SOLVE MY PROBLEM.    WAS CONTACTED BY AMERICAN HONDA AND WAS TOLD PARTS WHERE ON BACK ORDER, AND THAT THEY SHOULD ONLY TAKE ANOTHER FEW WEEKS.     ITS NOW THE END OF MARCH, THE BEGINNING OF APRIL, AND I'M STILL WAITING FOR SAID PARTS THAT WHERE ONLY SUPPOSE TO TAKE 2 WEEKS TO RECEIVE.    EVERY TIME I CONTACT THE DEALERSHIP OR AMERICAN HONDA ALL I'M GETTING IS THE SAME OLD DANCE AROUND ABOUT PARTS, AND SEVERAL TIMES THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN RUDE TELLING ME TO JUST WAIT.
