        "summary": "OUR 2002 GMC ENVOY WAS PLAGUED WITH REPEATED ELECTRICAL TYPE PROBLEMS NEARLY FROM THE BEGINNING OF OWNERSHIP IN JULY 2001. THESE PROBLEMS INCLUDE LOCKING US OUT WHILE RUNNING, MIRRORS NOT HOLDING PROGRAMMING, CD PLAYER CHANGING TRACKS DURING PLAY, DRIVER SEAT MOVING FORWARD AND CD PLAYER COMING ON WHEN VEHICLE WAS OFF AND NO KEY IN IGNITION, CD PLAYER THAT WAS ON SHUT ITSELF OFF AND THE DRIVER DOOR UNLOCKED DURING DRIVING, \"EASY OUT\" FEATURE OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT MOVED IT FORWARD INSTEAD OF REARWARD AS PROGRAMMED, FAN AND TEMP. SETTINGS CHANGING, DASHBOARD GAUGES NOT WORKING OR ILLUMINATING WHILE DRIVING.  WE MADE REPEATED TRIPS TO A GMC DEALER WITHOUT REPAIR BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEMS.  AFTER 17 MONTHS OF OWNERSHIP WE WERE NOT HAPPY AND FRUSTRATED TO HAVE AN EXPENSIVE VEHICLE WITH SO MANY PROBLEMS SO EARLY ON.  OUR ONLY RECOURSE WAS TO USE THE ARBITRATION PROCESS WITH THE BBB AUTO LINE AND OUR STATE'S LEMON LAW.  THE ARBITRATOR'S DECISION REQUIRED GMC TO BUY THIS VEHICLE BACK.  WE ARE VERY DISSAPOINTED GMC DID NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT AND CONCERNED THAT THIS VEHICLE WILL BE RE-SOLD AS IS.",
