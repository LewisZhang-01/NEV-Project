        "summary": "I WAS HEADING HOME AND BARELY ON THE TURNPIKE, WHEN I HEARD A BIG BANG AND I COULD NOT SHIFT GEARS ANYMORE. I HAD SOME TROUBLE TO GET MY CAR THROUGH THE TRAFFIC FROM THE HIGH-SPEED LEFT LANE TO A SAFE SPOT AND CALLED THE TOWING SERVICE. I WAS ABOUT 140 MILES AWAY FROM HOME AND THE COST, AFTER THE ROADSIDE INSURANCE PAID ITS PART, WAS $400.     AS IT TURNS OUT, THE PRESSURE PLATE OF THE CLUTCH BROKE INTO 3 PIECES. I WAS VERY LUCKY, AND SO WERE THE DRIVERS AROUND ME, THAT THE PROBLEM HAPPENED AT LOW SPEED SINCE THE BROKEN PIECES COULD HAVE EASILY TURNED INTO MISSILES, NOT TO MENTION THE INABILITY TO CONTROL THE CAR IN HEAVY TRAFFIC. ALTHOUGH THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY,  SINCE THE MILEAGE IS STILL VERY LOW, I BELIEVE THAT THE DEFECT IS SO UNUSUAL AND THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF SUCH A FAILURE ARE SO DANGEROUS THAT MANUFACTURER DOES BEAR A CONTINUED RESPONSIBILITY.    ON 2/18/03 I INFORMED THE MANUFACTURER THAT I EXPECTED THEM TO CONFIRM REIMBURSING ME FULLY FOR THE $400 TOWING COST AND TO BEAR AT LEAST HALF OF THE COST OF $912 FOR REPLACING THE CLUTCH,  $456. I ALSO OFFERED TO SEND COPIES OF THE RECEIPTS. THE BROKEN PARTS CAN ALSO BE INSPECTED IF YOU WHISH AT MY RESIDENCE OR AT A CONVENIENTLY LOCATED PLACE OF YOUR CHOICE.    SINCE I DID NOT HEAR FROM THE MANUFACTURER SINCE THEY ACKNOWLEDGED ON 2/19/03 RECEIPT OF MY EMAIL AND PROMISED ACTION WITHIN 48 HRS., THEY DO NOT SEEM TO BE TAKING RESPONSIBILITY. THEREFORE, I WILL HAVE TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS PROBLEM, RATHER THAN BEING A FREAK EXCEPTION, IS RATHER A FREQUENT OCCURRENCE AND THEREFORE I FEEL THAT IT IS MY OBLIGATION TO GO PUBLIC WITH THE CASE, SO THAT AS MANY CONSUMERS AS POSSIBLE CAN BE PROTECTED FROM A SIMILAR DANGEROUS EVENT WHILE DRIVING A VOLKSWAGEN.*JB",
