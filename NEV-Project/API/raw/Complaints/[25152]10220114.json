I CHANGED FUSES WITH NO RELIEF.  HAD SEARCHED FOR MECHANIC OTHER THAN DEALER TO LOOK AT VEHICLE BUT NO MECHANIC WILL LOOK AT OR SERVICE BECAUSE THEY SAY THAT THERE IS ALWAYS A PROBLEM WITH THE AIR SUSPENSION ON NAVIGATORS AND I WOULD NOT FIND ANY MECHANIC WHO WOULD TOUCH IT.  TODAY MY VEHICLE IS SITTING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE BECAUSE OF THE AIR SUSPENSION PROBLEM.  I DON'T TRUST THE DEALER AS THEY ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO GET ME TO PURCHASE A NEW CAR FROM THEM AND WHEN I DON'T THEY OVERCHARGE ME FOR REPAIRS.  *TR",
