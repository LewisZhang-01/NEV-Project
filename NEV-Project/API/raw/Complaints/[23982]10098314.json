        "summary": "(1)OUR LOW COOLANT LIGHT ILLUMINATED SO WE TOPPED OFF ENGINE COOLANT. WE WERE TURNING AROUND A CURVE AT ABOUT 45MPH AND WHEN THE LOW COOLANT LIGHT CAME ON  AGAIN.  (2) FORTUNATELY WE WERE JUST FINISHED A RIGHT CURVE ON A SECLUDED ROAD OR WE WOULD HAVE VEERED INTO ONCOMMING TRAFFIC WHEN ALL POWER STEERING WAS LOST. WE REGAINED CONTROL WITHOUT POWER STEERING,LIGHTS OR BRAKES ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. UPON INVESTIGATION WE WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE FLUID DISCHARGED FROM THE RESERVOIR AND COVERED ENGINE BELTS,BRAKES AND TIRES ON PASSENGER SIDE THEREFORE MAKING THEM SLIPP. THIS IS WHAT CAUSED POWER STEERING,LIGHTS,BRAKES AND TRACTION LOSS.  IF THE DRIVER WAS OF LESS STRENGHT AND AWARENESS, THE CONDITIONS WERE WET OR TRAFFIC WAS HEAVIER THIS COULD HAVE POSSIBLY BEEN A DISTURBING ACCIDENT AND POSSIBLY FATAL. (3) IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE VEHICLES LOWER INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET LEAKED WHICH CAUSED THE OVERHEATING AND DISCHARGE OF FLUID. VEHICLE HAD LESS THAN 60,000 MILES. A FRIEND OF OURS HAS THE EXACT SAME VEHICLE AND RECENTLY REPAIRED THE SAME PROBLEM. *AK",
