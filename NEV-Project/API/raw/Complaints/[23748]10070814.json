        "summary": "AUGUST 2003 AIRBAG SENSOR LIGHT CAME ON. WE WERE TOLD THAT IFTHIS SENSOR CAME ON, THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE AIRBAG SYSTEM AND THAT NONE OF THE AIRBAGS WOULD DEPLOY. IN RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM, WE FOUND THAT 525,254 CHEVY TAHOE LS, YEAR 2000 WERE RECALLED FOR DEFECTIVE SENSORS(SENSING DIAGNOSTIC MODULE) AND/OR AIRBAG PROBLEMS.  DURING A ROUTINE OIL CHANGE A DIAGNOSTIC SCAN WAS RUN ON THE VEHICLE. WE WERE THEN TOLD TO BRING THE VEHICLE INTO A DEALER FOR POSSIBLE WARRANTY WORK. EISINGER MOTORS, 1000 WEST IDAHO, KALISPELL MT 406-755-5555 TOLD US THAT WE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR THE REPAIR COSTS.  SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS ON THE RECALL LIST (ACTUALLY THERE ARE 5 NHTSA RECALLS ON THE CHEVY 2000 TAHOE LS), ARE WE ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR REPAIR COSTS? NHTSA STATES THAT DEALERS WILL RECALIBRATE THE SDM ON THE AFFECTED VEHICLES ANDTHAT OWNERS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE THE FREE REMEDY SHOULD CONTACT CHEVROLET OR GMC. IF THE AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT SYSTEM IS NOT IMMEDIATELY ATTENDED TO, THE DRIVER AND OR PASSENGERS COULD RECEIVE SEVERE INJURIES.",
