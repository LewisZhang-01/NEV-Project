        "summary": "MULTIFUNCTION LIGHT SWITCH HAS FAILED AFTER 60,000 MILES OF VEHICLE OPERATION. SYMPTOMS OF FAILURE ARE: FOG LIGHTS ENGAGE INTERMITTENTLY WHEN SIGNALING RIGHT-HAND TURNS OR WHEN DRIVING OVER ROUGH SURFACE ROADS.     AN ELECTRICAL \"POPPING\" NOISE CAN BE HEARD ORIGINATING FROM THE HEADLIGHT SWITCH STALK WHERE THE FOG LIGHT SWITCH RESIDES. ASSEMBLY WAS REMOVED AND INSPECTED FOR ANY PHYSICAL DAMAGE OR LOOSE WIRING CONTACTS, BUT NO EXTERNAL DEFECTS COULD BE OBSERVED. VEHICLE DOES NOT EXPERIENCE ANY SORT OF ABNORMAL USE OR ABUSE.     I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A POSSIBLE FIRE HAZARD, AS NUMEROUS OTHER OWNERS HAVE COMPLAINED OF SWITCH FAILURE LEADING TO MELTED, BURNED WIRES AND CONNECTORS IN THE MULTIFUNCTION SWITCH WIRING HARNESS, AS WELL AS IN THE SWITCH ITSELF.    THIS PROBLEM IS IDENTICAL TO THAT PLAGUING MANY PT CRUISERS, WHICH USE THE SAME SWITCH ASSEMBLY AS THIS VEHICLE.    THE PROBLEM WILL MOST LIKELY REQUIRE REPLACEMENT OF THE MULTIFUNCTION SWITCH ASSEMBLY, BUT AS THE DESIGN SHOWS NO SIGNS OF UNDERGOING AN ENGINEERING REVISION SINCE INTRODUCTION, I BELIEVE THAT ANY REPLACEMENT PART WILL ULTIMATELY PRESENT THE SAME PROBLEM AFTER ONLY A MATTER OF TIME. *TR",
