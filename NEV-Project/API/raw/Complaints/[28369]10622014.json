        "summary": "THE FIRST TIME, I SUDDENLY LOST POWER STEERING BUT WAS LUCKILY IN A PRIVATE PARKING AREA AND WAS ABLE TO STOP IMMEDIATELY.  RESTARTING THE CAR SOLVED THE PROBLEM.  THE SECOND TIME, I WAS EXITING A HIGHWAY ONTO A MAIN ROAD THAT WAS STRAIGHT.  I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE UNTIL I WAS AT A RED LIGHT AND I RESTARTED THE CAR TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  THE THIRD TIME WAS SCARY.  I WAS ON A CURVY, BUSY ROAD WHEN ONCE AGAIN, I SUDDENLY LOST STEERING.  I COULDN'T STOP AND STRUGGLED TO MANEUVER THE CAR THROUGH A CURVE WHEN I LUCKILY CAME TO A RED LIGHT.  I ONCE AGAIN RESTARTED THE CAR TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  I IMMEDIATELY DROVE MY CAR TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP BECAUSE I DID NOT FEEL MY CAR WAS SAFE TO DRIVE.   THIS DEFECT COULD EASILY LEAD TO A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.    THE REPAIR COST ME $1980.80 AND UPON COMPLAINING TO BOTH THE DEALERSHIP AND FORD, I COULD NOT RECOUP ANY OF THIS COST WHICH IS DUE TO A DEFECT OF THE VEHICLE.  I WAS TOLD TO WAIT AND SAVE MY PAPERWORK IN CASE THERE IS A FUTURE RECALL.       HOWEVER, THIS IS A SERIOUS, DANGEROUS DEFECT.  WILL THEY WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE IS KILLED?   THE AVERAGE MILEAGE ON THESE CARS FOR THIS TO HAPPEN SEEMS TO BE ABOUT 36,000 MILES WHICH MANY 2012 DON'T HAVE YET.  I FEEL I SHOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR MY REPAIR AND I FEAR OTHERS MAY NOT BE A LUCKY AS I WAS.  PLEASE URGE FORD TO RECALL THIS DEFECT BEFORE THESE CARS ARE INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS WHICH MAY CAUSE BODILY INJURY OR DEATH.  *TR",
