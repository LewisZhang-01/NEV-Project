DEALER SAYS I AM A \"GOOD CUSTOMER\" AND WILL \"EXTEND\" WARRANTY TO COVER THIS FOR A $250 DEDUCTIBLE, OR THIS WOULD HAVE COST ME $2300.  I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT, BUT I BELIEVE CHRYSLER HAS A PROBLEM WITH THIS FAMILY OF TRANSMISSIONS.  I HAVE 36.5K MILES, THE 36 MONTHS PORTION WAS UP IN OCTOBER.  THERE ARE SEVERAL PERSONS AT WORK WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SAME TYPE SYMPTOMS RELATED TO TRANS.  THIS TRANS IS ALSO USED ON DAKOTAS, DURANGOS AND AT LEAST THE 1500 RAMS. THE DURANGO OWNERS CLUB WEBSITE HAS ALSO HAD SEVERAL POSTS JUST FOR DECEMBER RELATED TO TRANSMISISONS WITH VEHICLES STARTING IN \"98.  HOW MANY MORE ARE OUT THERE THAT CHRYSLER IS NOT ADMITTING TO?  DEALER DIDN'T OPEN TRANS, JUST ORDERED THE REBUILD KIT (LAST MONDAY).  AS OF THIS MORNING, 12-30-02, MY TRUCK WAS STILL NOT BEING WORKED ON, HAVE HAD PARTS SINCE 12-26-02.",
