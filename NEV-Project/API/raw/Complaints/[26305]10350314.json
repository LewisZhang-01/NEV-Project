THIS IS A RECURRENT PROBLEM WITH FORD FOCUS AND SPECIFICALLY 2003 FORD FOCUS.  THIS IS VERY SEVERE. IMAGE YOU'RE IN A HURRY TO START THE CAR, THE KEY COULD NOT TURN AND YOU ARE STUCK. SO WHY IS THERE IS NOTHING DONE ABOUT IT BY FORD? I JUST ASKED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME IT IS AROUND $450 TO REPLACE THE IGNITION. I DON'T THINK I SHOULD PAY THIS MONEY DUE TO FORD'S FAULT. *TR",
