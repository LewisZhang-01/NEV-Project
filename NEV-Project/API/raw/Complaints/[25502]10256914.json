THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING OFF AND ON FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS NOW. THEN TONIGHT, I GOT STRANDED AT THE SUPERMARKET AND WAS STUCK FOR HOURS WAITING FOR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE. THE DISPATCHER NOT ONLY SENT OUT THE WRONG PERSON TO ASSIST ME, BUT THE FIRST TOW TRUCK THAT CAME WASN'T PROPERLY TO TOW MY CAR DUE TO THE WAY I WAS PARKED SO I HAD TO WAIT FOR A SECOND TOW TRUCK (A THIRD PERSON). NOW MY CAR WON'T START AT ALL, THE WHEEL IS COMPLETELY LOCKED UP, AND THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT TO THE MECHANIC IS TO CALL A TOW TRUCK AGAIN. HOWEVER, UPON DOING A GOOGLE SEARCH,  I FOUND THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM. AND FRANKLY, THIS CAR IS MY FAMILY'S ONLY DECENT FORM OF TRANSPORTATION, SO WITHOUT IT WE'RE PRETTY MUCH STUCK. *TR",
