VIA EMAIL AND THEY LEFT A VOICE MAIL THAT PARTS HAVE NOT BEEN AVAILABLE. RECALL STATUS ALSO HAS BEEN STATING - \"REMEDY NOT YET AVAILABLE\". RECALL WAS MADE IN OCT 25, 2018 AND IT IS NEARING 6 MONTHS BUT NO SOLUTION OR REPAIR PROCESS HAS BEEN INITIATED. LETTER STATES POSSIBILITY OF INCREASED RISK OF FIRE COULD OCCUR IF ENGINE INTAKE MANIFOLD HAS SMALL HOLES DUE TO FAILURE OF EGR.     KINDLY PLEASE HELP WITH THIS UNTIMELY AND UNREASONABLE TIME PERIOD OF REPAIR LINGERING WITHOUT ANY SAFETY FOR THE DRIVER OF THIS CAR. CURRENTLY NO PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED BUT FEELING OF DRIVING ON BORROWED LUCK AND TIME IS NOT A SAFE ONE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.",
