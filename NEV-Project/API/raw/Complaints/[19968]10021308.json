ONCE STOPPED, I AGAIN TRIED TO PUT THE WINDOW UP WHEN THERE WAS A CRACKING SOUND AND THE WHOLE WINDOW JUST FELL INTO THE DOOR.  WHEN I CALLED THE DEALER THE SECRETARY WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM AND WAS EVEN ABLE TO TELL ME THAT THE ORIGINAL CLIPS TO HOLD THE WINDOW WERE PLASTIC AND THEY REPLACE THEM WITH METAL ONES.  IF THIS PROBLEM IS THAT COMMON THAT THE SECRETARY KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND WHAT THE REMEDY IS, VOLKSWAGEN NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM.   *JB",
