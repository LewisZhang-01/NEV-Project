I HAD IT IN THE SHOP SEVERAL TIMES WHILE IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY, IT WOULD WORK, AND THEY WOULD GIVE IT BACK TO ME.  I KNOW GMC HAS RECALLED SOME OF THEIR BAD WIPER MOTORS AND WHY DON'T THEY RECALL ALL OF THEM.  IT HAS BEEN VERY DANGEROUS DRIVING IN BAD WEATHER AND THEY EITHER WON'T COME ON OR GO OFF WHEN THEY SHOULDN'T.  PUT ME ON A LIST WITH THE OTHER CUSTOMERS WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT.*AK",
