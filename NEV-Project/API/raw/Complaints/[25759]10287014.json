        "summary": "I BROUGHT MY 2000 TOYOTA TUNDRA IN TO BE SERVICED AT MY TOYOTA DEALERSHIP.  IT WAS DETERMINED THEN TO BE UNSAFE TO DRIVE.  THE DEALERSHIP DETERMINED THAT THE FRAME IS RUSTED OUT AND THE LEAF SPRING HAS PENETRATED THE TRUCK BED.  THIS TRUCK HAS REGULARLY BEEN MAINTAINED AT THE DEALERSHIP WHERE IT WAS PURCHASED.  ADDITIONAL RUST PROOFING WAS PURCHASED AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE.  OTHER THAN THE RUSTING FRAME, THE VEHICLE WORKS VERY WELL.  NOW IT CANNOT BE DRIVEN AND THERE IS NO SUGGESTION THAT IT CAN BE FIXED.  I AM AWARE THAT TOYOTA HAS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE TACOMA MODEL AND THAT TOYOTA HAS REIMBURSED TACOMA OWNERS ONE AND ONE HALF TIMES THE BLUE BOOK VALUE.  I AM ALSO AWARE THAT TOYOTA ACKNOWLEDGES THE PROBLEM WITH THE TUNDRA.  UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ARE UNRESPONSIVE TO ME.  I AM CURRENTLY RENTING A VEHICLE IN ORDER TO GET TO WORK AS I AWAIT THE NEXT STEP IN THIS PROCESS.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS TOLD ME TO LEAVE THE VEHICLE WITH THEM AS IT IS UNSAFE AND UNFIT TO DRIVE.  THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME INEQUITY IN THIS SITUATION.  I HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED TO REPORT THIS TO YOU. *TR",
