FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THIS IS A WORLDWIDE MAJOR FAILURE MODE WITH VW/AUDI ONLY REPLACING THE FAILED COIL PACK, THE OTHER COIL PACKS WILL FAIL IN TIME.  SOME OWNERS HAVE HAD UP TO 5 COIL PACKS FAIL AT VARIOUS TIMES LEAVING THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES STRANDED  IN UNDESIRABLE CONDITIONS AND PLACES.  MANY PEOPLE DON'T CARRY CELL PHONES ENHANCING THE PROBLEMS.  A TOTAL RECALL IS MANDATORY IN THIS CASE, IT'S NOT GOING TO GET BETTER! TS",
