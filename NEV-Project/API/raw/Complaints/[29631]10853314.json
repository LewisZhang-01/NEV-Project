        "summary": "THE CAR WAS STARTING FINE NO WARNINGS AT ALL THAT ANYTHING WAS WRONG.  WENT TO OUR PLACE OF WORSHIP AND WHEN WE CAME OUT IT WOULD NOT START.  HAD TWO LIGHTS ON DASH ONE WAS THE INTELLIGENT KEY LIGHT THE OTHER WAS THE RED CAR FLASHING WITH KEY IN THE MIDDLE.  HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED AND FORTUNATELY, WE HAD AAA.  MECHANIC HAS DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM TO BE THE ESCL.  WE WERE FORTUNATE THAT WE WERE IN A SAFE PLACE AND THAT WE HAD A AAA MEMBERSHIP TO GET THE CAR TOWED.  IF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST A WEEK EARLIER WHEN WE WERE OUT TOWN, IT COULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE COSTLY AND UNSAFE.  EVEN THOUGH ALL THESE CASES ARE NOT WHEN THE CAR IS IN MOTION IT IS TRULY DEPENDENT ON WHERE IT IS LEAVING THEM STRANDED AND TIME OF YEAR, WHICH COULD BE VERY UNSAFE FOR A FAMILY. TOTAL CHARGE WILL BE APX. $900.00.  DEFINITELY LOOKS LIKE AN ISSUE WITH MANY 2009 NISSAN ALTIMAS.  THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL ITEM AND WE SHOULD BE REIMBURSED, AS IT APPEARS THIS IS A MALFUNCTIONING PART THAT NISSAN IS AWARE OF, ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY EXTENDED THE WARRANTY, WHICH HAS EXPIRED AND NOW ALL OF US WHO HAVE HAD IT GO OUT PAST THE DATE ARE STUCK WITH THE BILL.  MY CAR HAS 71,000 MILES ON IT.  NOT A HIGH MILEAGE CAR AND I AM SURE MANY WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM.",
