THE FOLLOWING DAY THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE PROBLEMS WITH HESITATION BECAME WORSE AND THE CAR WOULD NOT GO OVER 50 MILES PER HOUR ON THE HIGHWAY AND WOULD ALMOST STALL WHEN I CAME TO A STOP. TOOK CAR IN FOR SERVICE AND THEY STATED THAT THERE WAS A FAILINING IGNITION COIL IN CYLINDER #3 WHICH WAS REPLACED. ON 11/28 THE CAR STARTING DOING THE SAME THING. I HAD TO TAKE IT TO A DIFFERENT DEALERSHIP THAT WAS CLOSER TO MY WORK BECAUSE THE CAR WOULD NOT ACCELERATE ON THE HIGHWAY AND I FELT VERY UNSAFE. AT THIS TIME THE CAR HAS 53440 MILES ON IT. RIGHT OUT OF WARRANTY! I CALLED BOTH DEALERSHIPS AND COME TO FIND OUT THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL BMW. I WAS CHARGED $681.06 FOR A KNOWN ISSUE AND THIS BEING THE 2ND TIME MY CAR HAS HAD THIS ISSUE. THIS TIME THE FAILURE WAS IN CYLIDERS 2 AND 6! AND WAS TOLD TO PAY TO REPLACE ALL AS THEY WILL CONTINUE TO FAIL! I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP BMW OF TOWSON AND NEVER RECEIVED A RETURN CALL. I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CHARGED FOR THIS SERVICE AS BMW OF CATONSVILLE WOULD HAVE DONE THE REPLACEMENT FOR FREE AS THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THIS CAR. I COULDNT DRIVE ALL THE WAY TO BMW OF CATONSVILLE BECAUSE MY CAR WOULD NOW ACCELERATE ON THE HIGHWAY. I AM CONTINUING TO LOOK FOR A REFUND OF $681.06 AS I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CHARGED FOR SOMETHING THAT BMW SHOULD HAVE RECALLED.  *TR",
