        "summary": "ON DECEMBER 19, 2002 AT 3:30 PM, WITH THE ENGINE WARMED UP AND THE TRANSMISSION INDICATING NORMAL TEMPERATURE, AFTER HAVING DRIVEN FOR 1 HOUR-PROBLEM FREE, I WAS COMING TO A STOP SIGN IN MY FORD F-250 DIESEL CREW CAB TRUCK AT THE INTERSECTION OF PLUMAS AND MOANA LANE, IN RENO, NEVADA. AS I TRIED TO SLOW DOWN, IT BECAME VERY CLEAR THAT THE ENGINE WAS STILL ENGAGED TO THE TRANSMISSION BECAUSE AS I SLOWED, THE DIESEL ENGINE BEGAN TO LUG DOWN AND JOLT THE TRUCK VIOLENTLY. THE ENGINE WAS ACCELERATING, BUT MY FOOT WAS OFF THE ACCELERATOR AND ON THE BRAKE. TO STOP THIS DANGEROUS SITUATION, I SLIPPED THE TRANSMISSION INDICATOR INTO N FOR NEUTRAL AND THAT STOPPED THE ACCELERATION THEREBY PREVENTING A FRONT-END COLLISION AND AFTER A FEW MOMENTS THE ENGINE STOPPED RACING.  AFTER A MINUTE OF IDLING, THE TRUCK WAS PLACED BACK IN D FOR DRIVE, AND THE TRUCK DROVE NORMALLY.     I TOOK THE FORD F-250 TRUCK TO JONES-WEST FORD OF RENO, NEVADA TO HAVE THE PROBLEM LOOKED AT. THEY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS THE ELECTRIC GAS PEDAL, BUT BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM, THE SERVICE MANAGER, A BUD, REFUSED TO HAVE THE ELECTRIC GAS-PEDAL REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY. I LATER LEARNED FROM MY SERVICE ADVISOR AT FORD THAT THIS WAS DONE DESPITE HAVING RECEIVED LIKE CONSUMER COMPLAINTS FROM FORD F-250 SERIES TRUCK OWNERS CONCERNING THE ELECTRIC GAS-PEDALS. TS",
