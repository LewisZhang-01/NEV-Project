        "summary": "SINCE THE VEHICLE PURCHASE, THE TRANSMISSION HAS PERFORMED ERRATICALLY, AND HAS DEGRADED OVER TIME.  THERE ARE THREE MAIN ISSUES, FIRST THE VEHICLE TENDS TO FUNCTION LIKE IT DROPS INTO NEUTRAL DURING LIGHT ACCELERATION.  SECONDLY, AND MORE OF A CONCERN,  THE VEHICLE CREEPS MANY FEET WHEN PLACED INTO 'PARK', WITH THE ENGINE OFF AND THE KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION, WHEN PARKED ON A GRADE.  FINALLY, IT TAKES UPWARDS OF 30 SECONDS WHEN SHIFTING FROM 'PARK' TO ANY GEAR FOR THE TRANSMISSION TO ENGAGE.  WHEN IT DOES FINALLY ENGAGE, IT GIVES THE FEELING OF 'SLAMMING' INTO GEAR.  THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN ON THE ROAD SINCE 5/01, AND HAS BEEN BROUGHT BACK TO THE DEALER MANY TIMES FOR THESE COMPLAINTS.  THE DEALER INDICATED THAT THIS BEHAVIOR IS NORMAL.  THE CONCERN IS THAT THERE IS A STRONG POTENTIAL FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE AND PERSONAL INJURY SHOULD THIS VEHICLE CREEP DOWNWARD.",
