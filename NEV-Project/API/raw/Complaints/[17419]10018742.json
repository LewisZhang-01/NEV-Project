ACCORDING TO FORD,  SOMETHING IN THE ALTERNATOR SYSTEM FAILED CAUSING THE ALTERNATOR TO CONTINUOUSLY CHARGE THE BATTERY UNTIL THE WIRING OVERHEATED, SHORTED OUT, SPARKING A FIRE.  THERE WAS NO NOTIFICATION OF A PROBLEM PRIOR TO THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT FIRE.  AFTER CONTACTING FORD'S CONSUMER COMPLAINT SYSTEM, FORD DECLINED TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM TO MY SATISFACTION.  THEY BASICALLY WASHED THEIR HANDS OF THE ISSUE STATING IT WAS NOT A FORD DESIGN PROBLEM AND THAT I COULD NOT ELEVATE THE PROBLEM TO ANY OTHER LEVEL WITHIN FORD.   *JB",
