AFTER A FEW MILES OF THIS, I CAME UPON A REST AREA AND PULLED OFF THERE.  AS SOON AS I STOPPED THE CAR, THE ENGINE STARTED SMOKING, AND MAKING A GURGLING, SIZZLING NOISE.  I HAD TO CALL AAA TO TOW ME BACK HOME, WHICH WAS 3 HOURS AWAY.  AFTER GOING BACK TO TAMPA, HAD MY CAR DROPPED OFF AT AAMCO TRANSMISSIONS.  I WAS ADVISED THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAD TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE IT WAS COMPLETELY BURNED UP INSIDE.  SO I HAD THEM REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION.  I SPENT ALOT OF MONEY BETWEEN THE TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT, TOWING, AND ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION WHILE MY CAR WAS BEING REPAIRED.    *NLM",
