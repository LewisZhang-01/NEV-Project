AS OF MARCH 25TH 2003, ONE YEAR, TWO DEALERS, 29,000 MISERABLE MILES AND SOME FIVE REPAIR ATTEMPTS LATER I STILL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. THERE IS DEFIENTLY A PROBLEM WITH THE 3.31 FORD REAR END. I HAVE RECENTLY DRIVEN ANOTHER NEW 2003 FORD TRUCK WITH 3.31 REAR END, VEHICLE ALSO HAD NOISE. THEN DROVE ANOTHER NEW PICK UP WITH THE 3.55 REAR END WHICH WAS TOTALLY QUIET. IN THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR I HAVE FILED NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS WITH DEALERS AND DIRECTLY WITH FORD. ONE WEEK AFTER PURCHASE, WHEN THE FIRST ATTEMPT TO FIX THE TRUCK FAILED, I ATTEMPTED TOGET THE DEALER TO TAKE THE TRUCK BACK BUT THEY SAID THAT WAS NOT AN OPTION. THIS VEHICLE IS SUPPOSE TO BA A TOP OF THE LINE FORD PICKUP RETAILING FOR OVER $30,000.00 WITH A 36,000 MILE BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY. FORD EITHER CAN'T OR WON'T FIX IT. THEY HAVE JUST OFFERED ME A BUY BACK ON THE TRUCK WHICH IF ACCEPTED WOULD COST ME AS FOLLOWS   THE OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE AT THE TIME THE TRUCK WAS PUCHASED.  $1,875.00 CASH DOWN PAYMENT    6,162.10 EQUITY OF TRADE IN       874.52 SALES TAX  A TOTAL OF $8,911.62 . IN ADDITION TO THE COST OF INSTALLATION OF PERSONAL EQUIPMENT WHICH TOTALS ABOUT $400.00. THIS IS NOT EVEN CONSIDERING PAYMENTS ON THE TRUCK FOR 12 MONTHS. NOW FORD HAS OFFERED TO BUY THE TRUCK BACK IF I PAY THEM OVER $5,000.00 ADDITIIONAL DOLLARS FOR THE MILEAGE ON THE VEHICLE. THIS WOULD MAKE MY TOTAL COST OVER 13,900.00 FOR OWNING A DEFECTIVE FORD PICK UP FOR 12 MONTHS. IN ESSENCE THERE IS NO WARRANTY. IT SHOULD BE FORD'S RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX THE DEFECT IN THE VEHICLE. IF THEY COULD NOT FIX IT THEY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN ME ANOTHER TRUCK LONG AGO. IT IS THEIR FAULT THAT IT HAS TAKEN A YEAR TO GET TO THIS POINT. I TRAVEL IN MY JOB AND HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO DRIVE THE MILES ON THE TRUCK. THEY CERTAINLY WERE NOT PLEASANT ONES.",
