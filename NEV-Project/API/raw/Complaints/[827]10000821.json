        "summary": "VOLVO CROSS COUNTRY'S FROM 1998 AND POSSIBLY OTHER MODEL YEARS ARE TURNING UP WITH MALFUNCTIONING CENTRAL CONTROL UNITS FOR THEIR ABS .  IT IS HARD TO GET INFORMATION FROM THE DEALERSHIP REGARDING THIS PROBLEM, BUT IT IS CLEAR THE MALFUNCTION IS WIDESPREAD IN THIS MODEL AND THAT IT ADVERSELY AFFECTS THE CAR'S BRAKING AND ABS.   REPLACEMENT OF THE PART COSTS MORE THAN $500, WHICH MAY PREVENT MANY VOLVO OWNERS FROM QUICKLY ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM, WHICH ACCORDING TO INDEPENDENT MECHANICS, POSES A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY THREAT.  I KNOW FIRST-HAND  THE MALFUNCTION CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN MY CROSS COUNTRY'S HANDLING AND BRAKING.   BECAUSE THIS APPEARS TO BE A PRODUCT DEFECT THAT AFFECTS THE CAR'S SAFETY, I SINCERELY HOPE REGULATORS WILL ENCOURAGE VOLVO TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND ISSUE A RECALL.  THANK YOU.  *JB",
