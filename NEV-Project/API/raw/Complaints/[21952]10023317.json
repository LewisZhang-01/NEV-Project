AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME, THEY WILL WORK AGAIN.  HAVE TAKEN THE FUSE OUT AND REINSTALLED IT IN CASE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOOSE.  SEEMED TO WORK FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS WITHOUT A PROBLEM, THEN SUDDENLY STOPPED WORKING AGAIN.  THERE IS NO LOGICAL SEQUENCE OF EVENTS WHEN THIS HAPPENS.  GM DEALERSHIP PUT IT ON THE COMPUTER BUT COULD NOT DETECT ANYTHING.  THEY INDICATED THAT THE SIGNALS WOULD HAVE TO BE 'NOT WORKING' WHEN I BROUGHT IT IN FOR THEM TO TELL WHAT WAS HAPPENING. THIS IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION, ESPECIALLY DURING HIGHWAY DRIVING.   *NLM",
