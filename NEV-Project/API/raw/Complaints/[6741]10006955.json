        "summary": "THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE DESIGN OF THE FUEL TANK/VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEM.  I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT WHEN THE FUEL TANK IS FULL FUEL SPLASHES INTO THE VAPOR RECOVERY CANISTER AND CAUSES THE CAR TO STALL.  THERE IS NO FIX FOR THE PROBLEM.  FORD ENGINEERS HAVE BEEN CONTACTED AND ARE WORKING ON THE PROBLEM.  I WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE 60-90 DAYS FOR A SOLUTION.  IN THE MEANTIME I WAS TOLD TO KEEP THE TANK 3/4 FULL OR LESS.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT I WAS NOT TOLD OF THIS DESIGN PROBLEM WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.  IF IT IS A DESIGN PROBLEM THEN EVERY SPORT TRAC SHOULD BE EFFECTED.  IT IS A SAFETY PROBLEM BECAUSE THE 4 TIMES THE VEHICLE STALLED ON ME THREE OF THEM WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A TURN.  ALL OF A SUDDEN I HAD NO POWER STEERING OR BRAKES.  EVEN FOR MYSELF , A LARGE MALE, I HAD TROUBLE COMPLETING THE TURN.  I SHUDDER TO THINK BOUT WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF MY 105 POUND DAUGHTER HAD BEEN DRIVING THE CAR AND IT HAD STALLED DURING A TURN.  IF THIS IS A DESIGN PROBLEM, THEN PEOPLE NEED TO BE WARNED WHEN THEY PURCHASE THE VEHICLE.  NOT FILLING THE GAS TANK COMPLETELY DOES  WORK, NO STALLS OCCUR.  THANK YOU.
