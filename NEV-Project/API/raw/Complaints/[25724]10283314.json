THIS IS SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD. I WENT TO THE TOYOTA DEALER TOYOTA OF MCDONOUGH (GA) AND THEY SAID IT WOULD COST $750 TO REPLACE ONE HEADLIGHT AND THE COMPUTER? THAT OPERATES IT. I CAN'T  PAY THAT AMOUNT TO FIX ONE DEFECTIVE HEADLIGHT. MY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THIS IS A NATIONWIDE PROBLEM WITH THE 2007 TOYOTA PRIUS AND IT IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY PROBLEM FOR THE OWNER. TOYOTA IS AWARE OF THIS DEFECT BUT AS FAR AS I CAN TELL HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALLED TO FIX IT. WHAT IS THE CONSUMER TO DO? THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS! HELP *TR",
