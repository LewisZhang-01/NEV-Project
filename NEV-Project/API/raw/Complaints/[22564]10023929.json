        "summary": "WAS BACKING OUT OF GARAGE WHEN I HEARD A LOUD SNAPPING NOISE AND THE DRIVER SIDE OF VAN WENT DOWN LIKE A TIRE HAD BLOWN.  GOT OUT AND DISCOVERED THAT TIRES WERE OK, BUT FRONT END WAS SAGGING DOWN WITH HARDLY ANY ROOM IN WHEEL WELLS FOR TIRES TO TURN.  CALLED TOW TRUCK AND HAD THEM TOW TO DEALERSHIP FOR INVESTIGATION OF PROBLEM.  THEY TOLD ME THAT BOTH TORSION BARS HAD BROKEN AND THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF ~$700.  I CONSIDER MYSELF REAL LUCKY BECAUSE I HAD JUST RETURNED FROM A TRIP OF OVER 900 MILES, PULLING A BOAT.  IF THE BARS WOULD HAVE BROKEN WHILE TRAVELING ON INTERSTATE AT 65 - 70 MPH THERE IS NO TELLING WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED AS FAR AS A ACCIDENT IS CONCERNED.  I BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A SAFETY HAZARD AND THE COST SHOULD BE PAID BY THE MANUFACTURE.  THANKS.    *NLM",
