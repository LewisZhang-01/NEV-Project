HAD A HECK OF A TIME MAKING IT HOME SAFELY. IMMEDIATELY TOOK TAHOE TO DEALER, WHERE AFTER MIS-DIAGNOSIS OF PROBLEM, WAS FINALLY RESOLVED WITH REPLACEMENT OF $400 WIPER MOTOR.  I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A RECALL OF 97 MODELS AND THIS WAS MANUFACTURED IN APRIL OF 1998. COULD THERE BE A LINK? CHEVROLET/GM HAS STATED IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS, THEY WILL NOT FIX THIS UNDER A SAFETY ISSUE, AND I AM ON MY OWN. NOT ONLY IS THIS THE 1ST VEHICLE I'VE EVER HAD A WIPER MOTOR GO BAD, BUT THAT COUPLED WITH THE RECALLS OF THE PRIOR YEAR'S ??? THAT'S MY COMPLAINT.   *NLM",
