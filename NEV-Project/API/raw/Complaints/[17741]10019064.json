WE HAVE REPLACED THE EGR VALVE TWICE IN A YEAR, THE WATER PUMP, THE THERMOSTAT, THE RADIATOR, THE RADIATOR CAP, AND IT STILL OVER HEATS TO THE POINT THAT THE CAR SHUTS DOWN AND THE HOT LIGHT COMES ON IN THE CAR.  I AM AT MY WITS END AND I HAVE PAID SO MUCH MONEY TO GET THIS FIGURED OUT AND NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW WHY.  I HAVE HAD IT TESTED FOR A HEAD GASKET LEAK AND IT SHOWS NOTHING.  THERE IS AIR GETTING INTO THE SYSTEM FROM SOMEWHERE BECAUSE IT CAN BE BLED OFF.  I REALLY LIKE THE WAY THIS CAR DRIVES AND I DO NOT WANT TO GET RID OF IT.  I JUST WANT IT TO BE FIXED AND I HAVE HAD 7 DIFFERENT MECHANICS TO WORK ON IT AND THEY ARE STUMPED!   *JB",
