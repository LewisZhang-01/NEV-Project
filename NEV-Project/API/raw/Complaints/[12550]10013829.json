        "summary": "I RECENTLY BOUGHT A 1998 FORD TAURUS WITH 49,000 MILES ON IT.  IT HAS AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM WITH THE INTERIOR LIGHTS.  AFTER I GET IN THE CAR AND DRIVE OFF, THE VEHICLE SOMETIMES THINKS THAT MY DRIVERS DOOR IS STILL OPEN.  THE DOOR IS AJAR LIGHT ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL REMAINS LIT AND THE INTERIOR LIGHTS STAY ON FOR SOME TIME.  I CAN MANUALLY TURN OFF THE DOME LIGHT BUT THE UNDER-DASH LIGHTS STAY ON.  I DON'T NOTICE IT DURING THE DAY BUT IT IS SOMEWHAT DISTRACTING AT NIGHT.  THE DOOR-OPEN DETECTOR IS NO LONGER A BUTTON BUT IS INSTEAD SOME SORT OF ELECTRONIC SENSOR BUILT INTO THE HINGE-SPRING MECHAMISM FOR THE DOOR.  IT WILL ALSO NOT ALLOW ME TO LOCK THE DRIVERS DOOR.  I HIT THE AUTOMATIC LOCKS BUTTON AND ALL FOUR DOORS LOCK THEN THE DRIVERS DOOR UNLOCKS ALL BY ITSELF.  I'VE HAD THE VEHICLE FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND THIS HAS HAPPENED TWICE NOW.  IT IS THE INTERIOR UNDER-DASH LIGHTS ON AT NIGHT THAT IS DISTRACTING.   *NLM",
