THE CAR STUTTERS BEFORE TAKING OFF THIS HAS CAUSED MY WIFE TO ALMOST GET INTO NUMEROUS ACCIDENTS.  WE HAVE TAKEN IT DOWN TO THE DEALERSHIP NUMEROUS TIMES, THE FIRST TIME THEY SAID IT WAS A CLOGGED VALVE AND THEY WOULD ORDER IT AND CALL ME BACK WHEN IT WAS IN STOCK.  WHEN I CALLED THEM 2 MONTHS LATER THEY SAID WE CAN SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT THE PART SHOULD BE IN STOCK, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT PART IT WAS EXACTLY SINCE IT WAS NOT LISTED ON THE WORK ORDER.  WHEN I TOOK IT BACK THEY SAID THERE WAS A SERVICE BULLETIN THAT STATED WHEN THE BRAKE IS DEPRESSED AND RELEASED THE CAR WILL HESITATE BEFORE GOING BECAUSE THE CAR STILL THINKS THE BRAKE IS ON, BUT THEY COULD NOT REPRODUCE THIS OR ANY OTHER PROBLEM ON OUR CAR.   WE HAVE ALSO HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS, AFTER TAKING THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP 5 TIMES THEY FINALLY \"CHECKED\" THE CONTROLS AND FOUND SOMETHING WRONG.   *NLM",
