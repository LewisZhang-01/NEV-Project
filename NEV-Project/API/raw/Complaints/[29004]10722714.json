IT'S ONLY ONCE, IT DOES NOT KNOCK CONTINUOUSLY.  IT STARTED MAKING THIS NOISE AFTER OIL CHANGE IN JANUARY EVERY SO OFTEN BUT IT HAS GOTTEN TO BE EVERY TIME I PUSH ON GAS AND LET GO NOW.  I WAS TOLD I NEED A TRANSMISSION FLUSH WHEN I GOT THE OIL CHANGED JUST RECENTLY IN APRIL.  COULD THIS BE THE WHAT IS CAUSING THE KNOCK NOISE?  I READ REVIEWS ON FLUSHES AND SOME SAY TO GET IT DONE , OTHERS SAY IT HAS DAMAGED THEIR CARS TRANSMISSION.",
