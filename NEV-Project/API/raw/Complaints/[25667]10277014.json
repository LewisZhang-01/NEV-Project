SHE INSERTED THESE PIECES INTO HER MOUTH AND ALMOST CHOKED.  GRACO DOES NOT ATTACH THE FABRIC TO THE EDGE OF THE CAR SEAT.  IT WAS VERY DISTRACTING FOR ME, THE DRIVER, TO KEEP WATCHING TO MAKE SURE THAT MY DAUGHTER WASN'T PULLING OFF THE FOAM (OR CHOKING ON IT) WHILE I WAS DRIVING.  I REPLACED THE SEAT WITH ANOTHER BRAND. *TR",
