        "summary": "WHILE MAKING A RIGHT HAND TURN, MY ESCAPE SEEMED TO LOSE POWER AND WAS VERYT HARD TO MAKE THE TURN.  GOT OUT OF THE TURN AND IT SEEMED FINE BUT THE  POWER STEERING ASSIST FAULT SHOWED UP ON THE DASH. THE NEXT TURN I MADE, IT DID IT AGAIN!    I GOOGLED IT AND IT SHOWED THERE WAS RECALLS FOR THIS EXACT SAME FAULT.  EDMUNDS REPORT 5-29-14 STATED FORD RECALLS 1.1 MILLION VEHICLES FOR POWER STEERING PROBLEMS, INCLUDING 2008-'11 FORD ESCAPE, 2011-13' FORD EXPLORER.   I TOOK MY 2009 FORD ESCAPE TO THE FORD DEALER TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT IT.  THEY RAN MY VIN NUMBER AND COMES UP AS NO RECALL!  THEY EXPLAIN TO ME THAT THEY HAVE RAN INTO THIS PROBLEM BEFORE.  THAT SOME OF THE RECALLS DON'T APPLY TO ALL VEHICLES LISTED IN RECALLS.  I TOLD THE DEALER HOW COULD THIS BE?  THEY OFFERED ME TO CALL FORD DIRECTLY AT 1-800-392-3673...I WILL CALL THIS NUMBER ONCE DONE WITH THIS VEHICLE SAFETY COMPLAINT.  IT'S A VERY GOOD THING I WAS TAKING  MY DAUGHTERS CAR TODAY TO GO AND PUT GAS IN IT WHEN THIS HAPPENED.  IF SHE WAS DRIVING IT, I'M NOT SURE SHE WOULD OF BEEN ABLE TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL WHEN THIS WENT OUT ON ME.  NO TELLING WHAT COULD OF HAPPENED AND THANK GOD SHE WASN'T DRIVING!",
