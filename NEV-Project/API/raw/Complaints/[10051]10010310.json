UPON INVESTIGATION, I DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF THE BOLT STUDS THAT HOLDS THE MASTER CYLINDER TO THE POWER BRAKE BOOSTER WAS BROKEN OFF AND MISSING. THE MASTER CYLINDER WAS PUSHED OUT OF THE BOOSTER TO ABOUT A 30 DEGEREE ANGLE. THE REMAINING STUD WAS STILL IN PLACE BUT BENT BADLY TO ONE SIDE. IF THERE HAD BEEN A PANIC STOP REQUIRED, I FEEL THAT THE MASTER CYLINDER COULD HAVE SEPARATED FROM THE BOOSTER, WITH THE EFFECT OF HAVING NO BRAKING EFFECTIVENESS. THIS COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT OR FATALITY.*JB",
