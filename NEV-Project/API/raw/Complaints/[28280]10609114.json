        "summary": "I HAVE A 2006 CHRYSLER PT CRUISER LIMITED TURBO WITH ONLY 31,262 MILES ON IT THAT STARTED OUT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO BY THE SEAT-BELT LIGHT COMING ON FIRST FOLLOWED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BY ALL OF THE SURROUNDING WARNING LIGHTS COMING ON AND THE GAUGES ALL DROPPING TO NOTHING. IT REPEATED THIS SEVERAL TIMES AN THEN STOPPED AND WENT BACK TO NORMAL. SINCE THEN THIS HAS HAPPENED ONCE OUT OF APPROXIMATELY EVERY THREE TIMES DRIVING IT, DOING THE SAME THING DESCRIBED ABOVE. TODAY ALL THAT CHANGED, NOT ONLY DID THE LIGHTS AND GAUGES GO CRAZY, THE ENGINE DIED REPEATEDLY AS WELL, ALL THIS HAPPENED IN 40 MPH TRAFFIC. IT SCARED ME TO DEATH, I HAD NO CONTROL AND WITH IT HAPPENING AS FAST AS IT WAS I HAD NO WAY OF WARNING THE CARS BEHIND OR BESIDE ME. JUST AS I HAVE SEEN BY OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME ISSUE OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND WITH THE 2006 MODEL THE POST ARE ALL THE SAME ISSUE, ALL HAPPENING IN THE SAME SEQUENCE, ALL TAKING THEIR CARS TO MECHANICS OF ALL TYPES, DEALERSHIP AND INDEPENDENT AND \"NOT ONE MECHANIC HAS FOUND A SOLUTION OR EVEN AN IDEA OF WHY THIS IS HAPPENING\". MY WIFE AND I ARE LIKE MOST I HAVE SEEN AND CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP TAKING IT IN TO BE TOLD THEY CAN'T FIND THE PROBLEM AND DEFINITELY AREN'T IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO PURCHASE ANOTHER VEHICLE. WILL BEG CHRYSLER TO HELP US ALL OUT. PLEASE FIGURE OUT WHAT IS CAUSING THIS BEFORE SOMEONE IS HURT OR EVEN KILLED. VERY FRUSTRATED TO SAY THE LEAST.............      *JS",
