REPAIR SHOP OTHER THAN THE DEALER SUGGESTED SWITCHING BRANDS OF TIRES BECAUSE AFTER THEY ALIGNED THE FRONT END THEY ROTATED THE TIRES TO TRY TO ISOLATE THE VIBRATION PROBLEM ONLY TO FIND THAT THE ROTATION NULLIFIED THE ALIGNMENT.  HARD FOR ME TO BELIEVE THAT WITH ALL THE VILLAGERS MANUFACTURED I'M THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM.",
