THE MOTOR STILL WORKS FIN THOUGH.  MY CONCERN IS OF MY CHILDREN'S SAFETY.  THE DOOR WILL NOT LATCH SECURELY NOW, AND/OR OPEN COMPLETELY.  WE HAVE SHUT THE AUTO DOOR OFF, BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.  THE DOOR GETS STUCK IN OPEN POSITION AND IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  WE HAVE SET THE CHILD LOCK AS WELL.  WE WILL NOT BE USING THAT DOOR AT ALL, IN CASE IT TRAPS ONE OF THE ARMS/LEGS OF OUR PASSENGERS.  TOYOTA IS REQUESTING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO FIX IT...  *TR",
