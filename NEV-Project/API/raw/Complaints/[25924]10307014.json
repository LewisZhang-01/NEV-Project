THE BRAKES COMPLETELY GIVE OUT AND YOU CONTINUE TO ROLL FORWARD WITHOUT STOPPING. ONLY WAY TO MAKE IT GO AWHILE WHEN IT OCCURS IS TO LET YOUR FOOT OFF THE BRAKE AND RE-APPLY. BUT YOU ARE AT RISK AT REAR ENDING SOMEONE SINCE THE VEHICLE STOPS MANY FEET FARTHER THEN YOUR SUPOSSED TO.    THIS ALSO HAPPENED ON MY 2007 TOYOTA TACOMA (WHICH I SOLD) IM ASSUMING IT HAD THE SAME BRAKING SYSTEM AS MY CURRENT TOYOTA. I BELIEVE THE ANTI LOCK BRAKE IS DEFECTIVE.  *CN",
