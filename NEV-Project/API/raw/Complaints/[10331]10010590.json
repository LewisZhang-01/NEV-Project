        "summary": "THE SEAT BELTS DO NOT RETRACT.  IT TAKES OVER 10 MINUTES FOR THEM TO RETRACT ONCE YOU UNFASTEN THEM.  MY SEAT BELTS WERE REPLACED WHILE UNDER WARRANTY AND THE PROBLEM WAS STILL NOT CORRECTED. I WAS TOLD \"THAT IS HOW THEY WORK\".   I AM NOW HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THEM LOCKING WHILE DRIVING.  THE LOCKING IS NOT TRIGGERED BY ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE FOUND IT JUST WON'T MOVE WHEN YOU TRY TO.  YOU CAN'T MOVE UNLESS YOU UNDO THE SEAT BELT WAIT FOR IT TO RETRACT AND THEN REFASTEN IT.  WHEN YOU UNFASTEN IT THERE IS A CLICKING NOISE AS IT RETRACTS.  THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH THEM WANTING TO HANG UP WHEN YOU PULL ON IT TO PUT IT ON.  THIS PROBLEM HAS EXISTED SINCE JUST A FEW MONTHS AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR.  IT CONTINUED TO GET WORSE.  AFTER NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS THEY REPLACED ALL THE SEAT BELTS IN THE CAR.  THE SITUATION IMPROVED SLIGHTLY BUT THEN STARTED GETTING WORSE AGAIN.  FROM THAT POINT ON THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE.   *NLM",
