I WORKED IT THROUGH MY INSURANCE AND THE WINDSHIELD WAS REPLACED BY A THIRD-PARTY INSTALLER WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE LOCAL SUBARU DEALERSHIP. AT THE TIME, I HAD ONLY 2K MILES ON THE VEHICLE.    IN MAY (05/09/2019), A SMALL ROCK HIT THE REPLACEMENT WINDSHIELD AND THERE IS NOW A LARGE CRACK. THE WINDSHIELD WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE HAD LESS THAN 5K MILES ON IT.     I'VE HAD TWO (2) BROKEN WINDSHIELDS BEFORE I HAVE EVEN HAD MY FIRST OIL CHANGE.    MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE WAS A 2007 SUBARU OUTBACK. I DROVE IT FOR 12 YEARS AND 235K MILES AND NEVER HAD A CRACKED WINDSHIELD EVEN THOUGH IT HAD BEEN HIT BY COUNTLESS ROCKS AND HAD NUMEROUS CHIPS.    TWO WINDSHIELDS IN THREE MONTHS SUGGESTS THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE MODERN GLASS THAT IS DESIGNED TO WORK WITH THE SUBARU EYESIGHT SYSTEM.    I WROTE AND ASKED SUBARU TO REPLACE THE SECOND WINDSHIELD AS A WARRANTY ITEM BUT THEY DECLINED.    BOTH INCIDENTS OCCURED WHILE DRIVING ON PAVED HIGHWAYS.",
