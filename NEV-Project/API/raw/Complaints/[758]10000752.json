        "summary": "ON FRIDAY, DECEMBER 27TH, 2002, MY SON ZACHARY, AGE 17, WAS DRIVING OUR 1999 FORD TAURUS.      (VIN # 1FAFP53U7XA255465) ON A TWO WAY STREET, SPEED LIMIT 35 MPH, WHEN HE NOTICED A BURNING SMELL AND SMOKE COMING FROM THE LEFT FRONT TIRE AREA.    HE MAINTAINED CONTROL AND IMMEDIATELY PULLED OFF ONTO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.     THE TIRE WAS SHREDDED - HE CALLED ME AND I ARRANGED FOR A TOW TO A LOCAL GARAGE.    THEY (MURRAY'S) FOUND THAT THE LEFT FRONT COIL SPRING HAD BROKEN, PUNCTURING THE TIRE AND WRECKING THE SHOCK TOWER UPPER BEARING.    MY SON DID NOT RUN OVER ANYTHING; THE COIL SPRING HAD SIMPLY BROKEN.    THE CAR HAS 75K MILES ON IT.    THE LOCAL GARAGE (MURRAY'S) TOLD US THE VERY NEXT DAY ANOTHER 1999 FORD TAURUS.   CAME IN WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM (RON MURRAY INC. (585) 334-5382).    MY FATHER -IN-LAW CONTACTED SOME FRIENDS WHO WORK AT LOCAL FORD DEALERS AND THEY WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM SPRINGS IN THE 1999 MODELS; IN FACT THE SPRINGS WERE CHANGED FOR THE NEXT MODEL YEAR.    HOWEVER, THERE IS CURRENTLY NO OFFICIAL RECALL FROM FORD.    I DID RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON THIS SAME EXACT PROBLEM -  ALL 1999 FORD TAURUS'S.     - PLEASE USE THE FOLLOWING LINK TO OBTAIN THE REPORTS:  HTTP://WWW.NHTSA.DOT.GOV/CARS/PROBLEMS    THE REPAIR BILL WAS $322.32 AND WE WERE WITHOUT USE OF THE VEHICLE FOR A WEEK WAITING ON PARTS.     IF MY SON HAD BEEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY - WELL, I HATE TO THINK OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED SHREDDING A FRONT TIRE AT 65 MPH.    PETER TICHACEK  (585) 265-5688",
