        "summary": "MY 2003 HONDA CIVIC HYBRID HAS A FAULTY SEAT BELT. THE BELT LOCKS UP AS THE PASSENGER TRIES TO BRING IT FORWARD. THIS CONDITION ALSO OCCURRED IN MY OTHER 4 HONDA CARS. THE SEAT BELTS ALSO TEND TO RATCHET UP AFTER BEING CONNECTED AND CAUSE DISCOMFORT TO THE PASSENGER AS THEY BECOME EXCESSIVELY TIGHT. THE DEALER CLAIMS THAT (1) THE RATCHETING OF THE SEAT BELTS IS ASSOCIATED WITH CHILD SAFETY PROTECTION AND (2) THE RATCHETING SHOULD ONLY OCCUR WHEN THE BELT IS EXTENDED FAR OUT FOR ATTACHING TO A CHILD SAFETY SEAT. I HAVE DUPLICATED THE PROBLEM IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SERVICE MGR. THE DEALER ALLEGES TO HAVE REPLACED THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT BELT; HOWEVER THE PROBLEM CONTINUES. I HAVE HAD OTHER EXPERIENCES WITH AMERICAN HONDA ALLEGEDLY REPLACING A PART (REFERENCE COMPLAINT # 10008215, IGNITION SWITCH RECALL) ONLY TO FIND THAT HONDA\u0019S STATEMENTS AND CLAIMS ARE HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE. I NOW ASK MYSELF WHETHER HONDA MIGHT BE ENGAGING IN DECEPTIVE AND FRAUDULENT PRACTICES TO PROTECT ITS PROFIT LINE IN DISREGARD OF THE SAFETY OF ITS CUSTOMERS. HONDA HAS FAILED TO RESPOND TO MY CONCERNS ABOUT THE ADVERTISED FUEL ECONOMY OF THE HYBRID. AFTER MEETING WITH A CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE, ERIC CATHERINE, FROM AMERICAN HONDA ON 3/24/03, THE REPRESENTATIVE MADE CERTAIN COMMITMENTS TO ADDRESS MY CONCERNS AND PROMISED TO GET BACK WITH ME IN \u001cA COUPLES OF DAYS.\u001d ONE OF THE COMMITMENTS WAS TO PERFORM A \u001cFUEL CONSUMPTION TEST\u001d ON MY HYBRID. AS OF 6/12/03, NEITHER THE REPRESENTATIVE NOR ANYONE FROM AMERICAN HONDA HAS LIVED UP TO THEIR COMMITMENTS. ACCORDING TO THE FUEL ECONOMY GUIDE POSTED ON THE VEHICLE, THE HYBRID IS SUPPOSED TO GET 48 MPG/CITY AND 47 MPG/HIGHWAY. EVEN THE FINE PRINT STATES THAT THE ACTUAL MILEAGE SHOULD RANGE BETWEEN 40 \u001356 IN THE CITY AND 39-55 ON THE HIGHWAY. I HAVE BEEN TRACKING/DOCUMENTING MY ACTUAL MPG. MY MPG HAS NEVER EXCEEDED 35. SINCE FUEL ECONOMY IS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR PURCHASING THE HYBRID, POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS SHOULD BE EXTREMELY SKEPTICAL OF THE CLAIMS.   *JB",
