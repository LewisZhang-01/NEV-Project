I KNEW THAT THIS WAS CAUSED BY WARPED ROTORS SO I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP.  THEY INFORMED ME THAT BRAKES/ROTORS ARE NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR ITEMS.  SINCE THE DEALERSHIP DID NOTHING, I HAD TO PAY TO REPLACE THE ROTORS AS I DIDN'T THINK TURNING THEM WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM AS THE CAR HAD ONLY 15,000 MILES ON IT.  TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.  A FOREIGN CAR WOULD NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND THEY DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE FIXED THE PROBLEM WHILE THE CAR WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.  IF THIS GETS FORWARDED TO JEEP, I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE LOST A LOYAL CUSTOMER FOREVER.  I ALSO LIKE TO TELL EVERYONE I MEET ABOUT HOW I HAVE EXPERIENCED SUCH POOR SERVICE FROM AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS.  *JB",
