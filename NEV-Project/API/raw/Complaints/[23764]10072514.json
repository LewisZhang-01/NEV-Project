        "summary": "MY 1996 ISUZU RODEO LS SUFFERED APPROXIMATELY 30 DRIPS PER MINUTE LEAK ON TOP OF MY V6 ENGINE, POSING A POTENTIAL EXPLOSION HAZARD. THE LEAK WAS NOT FOUND FOR OVER TWO MONTHS BECAUSE THE ODOR WAS ONLY PRESENT WHILE THE TRUCK WAS RUNNING.  FUEL WAS BURNING OFF THE ENGINE AND POSSIBLY IGNITED TWICE WHEN MY WIFE NOTICED SMOKE AND A STRONG UNIDENTIFYABLE ODOR.  IT WAS NOT UNTIL MAY 2 THAT I STARTED THE TRUCK ON MY DRIVEWAY, THEN POPPED THE HOOD THEN I SAW THE FUEL LEAKING ONTO THE ENGINE.  THE TRUCK HAD BEEN PLACED IN THE SHOP TO REPAIR OIL LEAKS JUST THE PREVIOUS WEEK, SO THE REPAIR WAS THOUGHT TO BE COMPLETE. THE FUEL LEAK WAS ATTRIBUTED TO A FAILED FUEL PRESSURE REGULATOR WHOSE HOUSING RUPTURED CAUSING THE FUEL LEAK.  THE PART IS AVAILABLE.  ROSENTHAL ISUZU ORDERED A NEW FUEL PRESSURE REGULATOR AND REPLACED THE DEFECTIVE ONE.",
