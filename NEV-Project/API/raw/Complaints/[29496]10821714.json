TOOK IT IN FOR AN OIL CHANGE & WHEN IT WAS PUT UP ON THE RACK, THE MECHANIC SAW THAT THE BRAKE LINES WERE RUSTED OUT.  I WAS SHOCKED SINCE IT HAS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED AND WAS EVEN MORE SO WHEN TOLD IT WOULD BE ANYWHERE FROM $900-$1,700 TO REPLACE THE LINES.  HE SAID THE LINES COULD FAIL WITHOUT ANY PRIOR WARNING WHILE DRIVING.  RESEARCHING, I FOUND THIS IS AN ISSUE GM HAS BEEN AWARE OF, HOWEVER INSTEAD OF THEIR ADDRESSING THE MANUFACTURING PROBLEM, THEY PUT THE RESPONSIBILITY ONTO THE OWNERS.   LIKE MYSELF, I'M SURE OTHERS ARE DRIVING TOTALLY UNAWARE OF THE BRAKE LINE FAILURE ISSUE SINCE THERE HAS BEEN NO RECALL.",
