THE VIN NUMBER IS [XXX] I PURCHASED A 2014 NISSAN VERSA FROM MAITA NISSAN IN SACRAMENTO (NOW CALLED SACRAMENTO NISSAN) AND I'M JUST NOT SATISFIED. THIS CAR DOES NOT AT ALL SOUND LIKE A NEW CAR. I DROVE IT OFF THE LOT WITH 9 MILES ON IT, BUT IMMEDIATELY NOTICED HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR THE TRANSMISSION TO SMOOTHLY GET INTO GEAR. IT'S LOUD AND ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE IT'S COMPLETELY BROKEN. WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE I HEAR A LOUD CLUNKING SOUND WHETHER IT'S ON A FLAT SURFACE OR IN THE DRIVEWAY. I'VE DISCUSSED HEARING THIS SOUND BEFORE 4 DIFFERENT TIMES AND ALSO WENT TO THE NISSAN SERVICE DEPARTMENT 4 TIMES. I'M BEING TOLD NOTHING IS WRONG. I DIDN'T PURCHASE A \"BRAND NEW\" CAR TO HAVE ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS. I CALLED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND ADVISED THEM ABOUT THE ISSUES AND REQUESTED A BUY BACK. AFTER WAITING 3 WEEKS FOR AN ANSWER, THEY ADVISED ME ON 4/9/15 THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ACCOMMODATE MY REQUEST.      I FEEL THIS CAR HAS AN UNSAFE TRANSMISSION AND BRAKING SYSTEM.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
