IT ALMOST FELT LIKE THE CAR WOULDN'T STOP.  I'M TAKING THE CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP THIS EVENING FOR THIS AND OTHER ISSUES, HOWEVER, THE SERVICE MANAGER SEEMED AS IF HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS PROBLEM BEFORE.  IT'S ANNOYING TO THINK THAT THE SERVICE MANAGER WOULD NOT BE AWARE OF IT SINCE IT HAS BEEN SO COMMON.*AK",
