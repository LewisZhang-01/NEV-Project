THE FRONT LEFT TIRE WAS POINTING OUT AND THE STEERING WHEEL WAS OFF CENTER.  I TOOK IT TO THE GARAGE AND THE MAIN CROSS MEMBER RUSTED THROUGH AND BROKE.  I CONTACTED JEEP AND THEY SAID THAT THERE WAS AN EXTENDED 10 YEAR WARRANTY ON THIS PARTS DUE TO THE SAME ISSUES.  HOWEVER, THE 10 YEAR WARRANTY RAN OUT IN JULY 2016.  IF THEY KNOW THAT THERE ARE ISSUES AND ALREADY EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR 10 YEARS; WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT RIGHT ON ALL THE VEHICLES.",
