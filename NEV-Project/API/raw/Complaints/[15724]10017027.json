        "summary": "THIS IS A GENERAL CONCERN RATHER THAN AN ACUTE PROBLEM WITH A SPECIFIC VEHICLE. I HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO JUST TURNED ONE SO I HAVE BECOME VERY AWARE OF CHILD SAFETY SEAT ISSUES.  RECENTLY I SAW AN INFANT IN A PASSING CAR SEATED IN A \"CONVERTIBLE\" TYPE CAR SEAT. THE CHILD WAS ASLEEP AND ITS HEAD WAS DANGLING FORWARDS IN A WAY THAT PROMISED MAJOR C-SPINE INJURY IF THE CAR WERE TO CRASH. THE PROBLEM WAS THE SEAT WAS NOT INSTALLED PROPERLY- IT WAS ANGLED SO FAR UPRIGHT THAT THE CHILD'S TORSO WAS NEARLY VERTICAL.  I KNOW THAT INCORRECT INSTALLATION IS A COMMON PROBLEM, BUT IN THIS SITUATION IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO INSTALL THE SEAT CORRECTLY. THE PROBLEM IS  THE BACK OF THE CHILD-SEAT IS SO HIGH THAT IT HITS THE CAR'S FRONT SEATS. THE CAR IN THIS CASE WAS AN ECONOMY COMPACT CAR, BUT EVEN IN MY OWN MID SIZE CAR I CANNOT INSTALL MY DAUGHTER'S SEAT CORRECTLY FOR REAR-FACING USE ANYWHERE EXCEPT THE CENTER POSITION IN THE REAR SEAT. (SO THAT THE BACK OF HER SEAT IS BETWEEN THE FRONT SEATS) THIS HAS BEEN MANAGEABLE, BUT WOULD HAVE BEEN A REAL PROBLEM IF I HAD TWO CHILDREN.  THE REAL PROBLEM HERE IS THE CHILD SAFETY SEATS. LOOKING AT WHAT'S AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET, THERE ARE REAR-FACING CARRIER/SEATS FOR NEWBORNS AND THERE ARE \"CONVERTIBLE\" SEATS FOR NEWBORN THROUGH AS MUCH AS 40 LBS, MADE TO MOUNT FORWARDS OR BACKWARDS. IN THE INTEREST OF MAKING THE SEATS ADAPT TO MUCH BIGGER AND OLDER KIDS, THEY HAVE MADE THEM SO BIG THAT THEY DON'T FIT WELL FOR BACKWARDS-FACING USE IN THE MAJORITY OF CARS.      ONCE YOUR CHILD OUT GROWS THE CARRIER-STYLE NEWBORN SEAT, THEY HIT A TRANSITION PERIOD WHERE THEY STILL HAVE TO RIDE REAR-FACING BUT HAVE TO USE A SEAT THAT IS MADE FOR BIGGER KIDS. THIS IS A DANGEROUS TIME, AND IMPACTS MOST ON LOWER INCOME FAMILIES SINCE THEY WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE SMALLER CARS.    *JB",
