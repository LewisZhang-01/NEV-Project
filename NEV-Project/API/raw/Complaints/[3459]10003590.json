SINCE I BOUGHT MY 2000 FOCUS ZTS (WITH LESS THAN 45,000 MILES ON IT) IT HAS HAD ALL THE RECALL SERVICES DONE (SIX, IF I RECALL CORRECTLY) AND TWO WINDSHIELDS REPLACED TOO (DUE TO EDGE CRACKS DEVELOPING).  THIS WEEK A SERIOUS NEW PROBLEM SURFACED: A WIRE SHEARED OFF WITHIN A CONNECTOR THAT GOES TO THE IGNITION COIL, PART OF THE MAIN ENGINE HARNESS.  I WAS TRAVELING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE ENGINE SIMPLY DIED.    IF THIS HAPPENED IN TRAFFIC OR ON THE HIGHWAY, A SERIOUS ACCIDENT WOULD HAVE RESULTED.  LUCKILY, I WAS ON A QUIET STREET.    THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT FORD SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE AND CORRECT AT NO CHARGE TO THE OWNER.    TO MAKE THE MATTER WORSE, THE DEALER TELLS ME THAT THE CONNECTOR THAT FAILED IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM FORD AS A REPLACEMENT PART -- THE WHOLE MAIN ENGINE HARNESS HAS TO BE REPLACED, WITH MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS OF LABOR REQUIRED, PLUS THE COST OF THE HARNESS.  IT WILL END UP COSTING CLOSE TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS.  IF THE CONNECTOR WERE AVAILABLE IT WOULD COST UNDER THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO REPAIR.",
