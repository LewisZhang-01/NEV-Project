WAS NOT CALLED IN FOR RECALL OF KEYS UNTIL, 12/05/14.  HEATER STOPPED WORKING BY 50%, ELECTRIC DOOR LOCK STOPPED WORKING APPROX SAME TIME.  BRAKES NOT WORKING AS WELL, SAME TIME FRAME.   EVERYTHING WAS CHECKED OUT IN FEB; THIS YEAR, ALTHOUGH STARTED NOTICING STEERING PROBLEMS AUGUST, SEPTEMBER., 2014.  I THOUGHT IT WAS A SLOW LEAK IN THE TIRE CAUSING THE STEERING PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH NOW BELIEVE IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM, STEERING COLUMN AREA.   WE WERE CHARGED FOR THE REPAIR, EVEN THOUGH IT FALLS UNDER THE RECALL COMPLAINTS.  WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS GOING TO BE A $100 OR $150.00 JOB, AS I OK'D  THEM TO USE THE MULTI-POINT INSPECTION MACHINE AND CHECK ANTI FREEZE LEVEL, COSTS US $688.15.  THE FIRST ESTIMATE WAS OVER $4,000, UNBELIEVABLE, IN WHICH THE AGENT SAID \" THEY HAD TO PAY THE MECHANIC FOR HIS LABOR\".   $533.76 FOR LABOR, $131.50 FOR A PART WHICH IS A RECALL.   SERVICE STABILITY CONTROL SYSTEM .   I WILL BE GOING BACK TO TALK WITH GMC MANAGER.  *TR",
