        "summary": "WHEN I FILLED MY CAR UP IT WOULD SUDDENLY SHOW IT WAS EMPTY & A CHECK ENGINE ICON SHOWED UP & YELLOW LOW ON GAS WARNING LIGHT STARTED DINGING LAST FALL 2010. WHEN I DROVE APPROX 25 TO 30 MILES IT WOULD REGISTER GAS NORMALLY & ENGINE LIGHT WOULD GO AWAY. I FILL UP EVERY 2- 3 WEEKS NORMALLY. THEN THIS PAST FEBRUARY IT WENT HAYWIRE & WHEN I FILL UP IT GOES TO THE EMPTY SIDE, ENGINE ICON SHOWS UP & LOW ON GAS LIGHT DINGS & IT NEVER REGISTERS CORRECTLY AT ALL, THE GAS HAND IS ALL OVER AND I HAVE BEEN HAVING TO USE THE MILEAGE GAUGE TO EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH I MIGHT HAVE. IT LOW GAS WARNING WILL STAR DINGING & I AM DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD OR INTERSTATE FOR NO REASON & STARTLE ME. IT HAS CAUSED ME TO SUDDENLY JERK THE STEERING WHEEL BECAUSE I AM STARTLED & THAT IS DANGEROUS IN ITSELF. OUR FAMILY HAS BEEN OWNED GM CARS FROM THE MID 1990'S ON AND THIS HAS CAUSED A VERY UNSAFE FEELING FOR ME. I HAVE CHILDREN & GRANDCHILDREN WITH ME AND I FEEL VERY UNSAFE FOR THE 1ST TIME IN THIS VEHICLE I AM SO NERVOUS JUST DRIVING TO WORK & BACK & MY EYES ARE CONSTANTLY MONITORING THE PANEL WHEN I NEED TO KEEP FOCUSED ON MY DRIVE. I AM SO CONCERNED THAT SINCE THE GAS GAGES ARE SO WRONG WHAT WOULD JUST KEEP IT FROM \"SENSING\" THERE IS NO GAS AND SUDDENLY STOP! I WOULD HATE FOR IT TO TAKE A DEATH TO PUSH THIS PROBLEM TO BE A RECALL. I AM ALSO A CONSUMERS REPORT PANELIST AND THIS WILL BE ON THEIR REPORT THIS YEAR FOR SURE. I HAVE DEALT WITH THE NOISE ISSUES AS YOU DRIVE & SMALL THINGS THAT HAPPEN AS TIME GOES ON, BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY AN ISSUE FOR RECALL. I NEED A SAFE VEHICLE AND TO TRADE IS NOT THE ANSWER YET AS I WOULD NOT BE HONEST IN SOMETHING ELSE BUYING THIS CAR AND MAYBE LOSING THEIR LIFE PLEASE I BEG LISTEN TO THE NOTICES YOU HAVE RECEIVED CONCERNING THIS, THESE ARE REAL AS I HAVE SENSED MYSELF IN THEIR CONCERNS & COMPLAINTS.",
