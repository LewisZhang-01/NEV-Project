I RESEARCHED AND LEARNED THAT THERE ARE KNOWN DEFECTS WITH THE FACTORY INSTALLED COIL PACKS LEADING TO CRACKS AND WATER PENETRATION AFTER 10K MILES. I HAD 10300 MILES ON THE VEHICLE. I ASKED VW OF AMERICA TO REPLACE ALL 4 IGNITION COIL PACKS WITH NEW, DEFECT FREE PARTS AND VW REFUSED. MEANWHILE THE VEHICLE IS STILL AT THE DEALER (1 WEEK AND COUNTING) AWAITING A REPLACEMENT FOR THE FAILED PART. I AM WORRIED ABOUT DRIVING THE CAR WITH THE DEFECTIVE COILS AND PUTTING MYSELF, MY WIFE, AND TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS AT RISK. IF VW DOES NOT RECTIFY THE PROBLEM WITH 4 REPLACEMENTS I WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO ENGAGE THE MASSACHUSETTS LEMON LAW.",
