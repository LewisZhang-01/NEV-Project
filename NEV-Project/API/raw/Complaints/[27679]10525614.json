        "summary": "THE BRAKE LIGHT CAME ON AND WITH NO WARNING THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS A DIGITAL TYPE GRINDING NOISE WITH  ALMOST NO USE OF BRAKES.  DROVE THE VEHICLE TO THE NEAR DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED BY NISSAN TO REPROGRAM A VDC UNIT.  WE WERE TOLD THAT IF THE PROBLEM RETURNS WE ARE TO NEED TO REPLACE A BRAKE BOOSTER $818.  SO LAST WEEK PROBLEM HAPPENED AGAIN WITHOUT WARNING THIS TIME WITH MY 3YR OLD DAUGHTER IN THE CAR AND I WAS LUCKY THAT IT DID NOT RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT.  $818 IS A FINANCIAL HARDSHIP FOR AN OBVIOUS HUGE SAFETY ISSUE WITH NISSAN.  MY UNDERSTANDING OF OTHERS IN THE SAME SITUATION IS THAT THE BRAKE BOOSTER IS NOT THE PROBLEM BUT THAT THE PROBLEM LIES IN THE ABS BUT NISSAN HAS NO INTEREST IN THE SAFETY OF THEIR VEHICLES OR THE PEOPLE DRIVING THEM.   THE VEHICLE IS PARKED AS I AM TOO AFRAID TO DRIVE IT NEEDING TO DRIVE UP AND DOWN A MOUNTAIN.  I WAS FLOORED TO HEAR THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH NISSAN ARMADA OWNERS AND NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE FOR A RECALL OF THIS ISSUE.  I DON'T WANT SOMEONE TO LOSE THEIR LIFE IN ORDER FOR NISSAN TO FIX THEIR PROBLEM.  PLEASE HELP!  *TR",
