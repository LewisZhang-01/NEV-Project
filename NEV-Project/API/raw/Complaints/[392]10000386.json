        "summary": "ON DECEMBER 13, 2002, AT 5:00 PM, IN A SNOWSTORM IN RENO, NEVADA, FORD F-250 DIESEL CREW CAB WAS STOPPED AT A RED LIGHT; TEMPERATURE WAS 35 DEGREES, TRUCK WAS IDLING NORMALLY; THE ENGINE WAS WARMED UP AND THE TRANSMISSION INDICATED NORMAL TEMPERATURE. UPON RECEIVING A GREEN LIGHT, I ATTEMPTED TO ACCELERATE BUT THE DIESEL ENGINE WOULD NOT RESPOND TO COMMANDS FROM THE ACCELERATOR-PEDAL. AFTER REPEATED, PUMPING THE ACCELERATOR I WAS ABLE TO GET SOME ACCELERATION FROM THE ENGINE TO CLEAR THE INTERSECTION; 20 SECONDS LATER, THE ACCELERATOR RESPONDED NORMALLY. I TOOK IT TO THE FORD DEALER BUT BECAUSE THE INTERMITTENT FAILURE COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED, THE FORD DEALERSHIP WOULD NOT REPLACE THE ELECTRIC GAS-PEDAL DESPITE HAVING CHANGED 5 IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS IN SIMILAR F250 TRUCKS. MILEAGE OF TRUCK 11,700 MILES. TOTAL TIME SINCE PURCHASED 7 MONTHS.",
