REC'D ANOTHER LETTER FROM TOYOTA STATING SAME PROBLEM.  CALLED NEWARK TOYOTA ABOUT STATUS OF PART ORDERED.  STILL ON WAITING LIST.  NO EXPLANATION WHY THIS IS TAKING SO LONG.  CALLED CORPORATE.  APPARENTLY PARTS ARE BACKORDERED AND NOTHING BEING SENT TO DEALERSHIP.  APPARENTLY THEY ARE STILL USING THE SAME MANUFACTURER FOR THE MODULE THAT SUPPLIED ALL THE FAULTY VEHICLES.  WHY!!!  IT SEEMS THAT THEY REALLY ARE NOT TAKING THIS VERY SERIOUSLY.  WHY AREN'T WE OFFERED LOANER OR RENTAL CARS AS IN THE CASE OF HONDA WHO HAS THE SAME PROBLEM?  HOW MANY LIVES ARE EXPENDABLE BEFORE SOMETHING IS DONE TO REMEDY THE SITUATION.  I SEE THAT THERE ARE OVER SEVEN MILLION REPAIRS SO FAR.  WHEN WILL MY CAR BE FIXED?",
