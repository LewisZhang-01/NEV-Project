        "summary": "LATCH STRAPS ON THE BRITAX MARATHON CHILD SAFETY SEAT ARE NOT LONG ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME TO INSTALL THE SEAT REAR FACING IN MY 2003 CHEVY TRAIL BLAZER.  EXTREME FORCE MUST BE USED IN ORDER FOR THE LATCH CONNECTORS TO REACH THE LATCH ANCHORS FOR FORWARD FACING INSTALLATION.  BRITAX HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM AND THEY HAVE CHANGED THE LENGTH OF THE STRAPS ON NEWLY MANUFACTURED SEATS.  HOWEVER, THEY WILL NOT PROVIDE ANY HELP TO THOSE WITH EARLIER MANUFACTURED SEATS.  ACCORDING TO THE LATCH LAW EFFECTIVE 9/02, ALL CHILD SAFETY SEATS MUST BE LATCH COMPLIANT.  IN MY OPINION, THE TWO BRITAX MARATHON SEATS THAT I OWN ARE IN VIOLATION OF THIS LAW BECAUSE LATCH INSTALLATION IS IMPOSSIBLE DUE TO THE LENGTH OF THE STRAPS ON THE LATCH CONNECTORS. *JB",
