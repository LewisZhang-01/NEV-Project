        "summary": "I BACKED UP TO THE LAUNDRY TO WASH CLOTHES AND PROCEEDED TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND GET OUT TO GET CLOTHES OUT OF THE BACK. I PUSHED THE BRAKE AND THOUGHT I HAD PUT THE CAR IN PARK BECAUSE THE KEY CAME OUT. WHEN I STARTED TO STEP OUT OF THE VAN TO GET MY CLOTHES OUT OF THE BACK AND MY FOOT CAME OFF THE BRAKE, THE CAR WAS STILL RUNNING AND BACKED INTO A BLOCK WALL. THE WALL WAS DESTROYED, BUT NO ONE WAS HURT. THE BACK DOOR OF THE VAN IS CRUSHED. AFTER A CLOSE EXAMINATION OF THE IGNITION LOCK I FOUND THAT THE KEY WILL COME OUT IN ANY POSITION, INCLUDING RUNNING. I HAD THOUGHT THE KEY WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO COME OUT EXCEPT IN THE OFF POSITION. IS THIS CORRECT? I ATTEMPTED TO FIND OUT IF IT WAS IN THE GM RECALL FROM MY LOCAL GM DEALER AND THEY CLAIMED IGNORANCE OF ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING. INCLUDING EVEN WHAT CONSTITUTES A DEFECTIVE SWITCH AND WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO AND NOT DO. IT'S LIKE PULLING TEETH TRYING TO GET THEM TO SAY ANYTHING. THEY SAY THE FACTORY SENDS THEM A LIST AFFECTED CARS AND THEY WILL NOT TOUCH ANYTHING ELSE NO MATTER WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE SMELL OF GASOLINE IS STRONG AT TIMES BUT A CURSORY EXAMINATION BY A MECHANIC DOESN'T SHOW ANYTHING. AFTER VIEWING THE RECALLS CONCERNING GAS LEAKS I AM WORRIED. CAN YOU TELL ME BY THE VIN HOW MANY OF THE RECALLS SHOWN ON YOUR PAGE THIS VEHICLE HAS HAD AND WHAT IT HAS MISSED BEFORE IT BURNS ME TO DEATH?   *TR",
