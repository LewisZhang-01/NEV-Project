AS SOON AS I DID THE ENGINE QUIT.  AFTER HAVING IT TOWED TO THE CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP, I WAS TOLD THAT THE ENGINE IS FULL OF \"SLUDGE\" AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.  COST OF NEW ENGINE IS APPROXIMATELY $8,500 WHICH IS MORE THAN THE WHOLESALE VALUE OF THE CAR.  SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 2.7 ENGINE ON THE DODGE INTREPID'S.
