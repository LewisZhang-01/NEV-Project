WITHIN THE WEEK NOTICED WATER IN THE OIL AND WENT TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO A SERVICE STATION.  WHEN I STARTED THE TRUCK THERE WAS A LOUD KNOCKING, PROVING TO BE A DAMAGED ROD.  LATER RESEARCH SHOWED THAT THIS IS COMMON IN THE 4.2 LITER V-6 ENGINE DUE TO FAULTY GASKET.  FORD RAN A \"CAMPAIGN,\" BUT I NEVER RECEIVED ANY NOTIFICATION AS TO THE PROBLEM. *JB",
