TIRES ARE ROTATED AND BALANCED REGULARLY IN WHICH I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT A LACK OF THIS TYPE OF MAINTENANCE CAUSES THIS PROBLEM.  SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I AM HAVING THE PROBLEMS WITH MY TIRES.  I CONTACTED GOODYEAR ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND I WAS INSTRUCTED TO TAKE MY CAR TO A GOODYEAR DEALER IN WHICH I DID AND THEY CHECKED THE ALIGNMENT, THE ROTATION RECORDS, AND THE BALANCING AND ALL THOSE THINGS CHECKED OUT.  THEY STILL REFUSED TO REPLACE THE TIRES AND REFUSED TO CONTACT GOODYEAR ABOUT THE RESULTS IN WHICH I HAD AND INTERNET EMAIL FROM CHEEDA MOORE INSTRUCTING THEM TO CALL HER DIRECTLY IF THEY COULD NOT HELP ME AND THEY DID NOT.*JB",
