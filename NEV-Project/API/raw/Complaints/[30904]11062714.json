I PULLED INTO A SPACE ON THE EDGE OF THE LOT AND CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP. MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE, I WAS ABOUT TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK WHEN THE ENGINE LOUDLY AND SUDDENLY REVVED AND THE CAR SURGED FORWARD UP ONTO A CONCRETE CURB AND RAMMED INTO A 4 FT HIGH CONCRETE RETAINING WALL.  THE FORCE OF THE IMPACT TORE THE WALL APART FROM THE ROOF - MY CAR WAS STILL ACCELERATING, WHEELS SPINNING.  THE BROKE WALL STOPPED BY CAR FROM COMPLETELY GOING OVER AND I WAS ABLE TO TURN THE ENGINE OFF AND GET OUT.  THERE WERE WITNESSES WHO CAN VERIFY THAT I WAS AT A COMPLETE STOP, BRAKE LIGHTS ON AND IT ALL HAPPENED IN A FEW SECONDS.  IT WAS SO SHOCKING THAT I WILL NEVER DRIVE A BMW AGAIN.",
