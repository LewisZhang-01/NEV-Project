ACCORDING TO THE DEALER, THIS PART IS ON AN INDEFINITE NATIONAL BACK ORDER.  THUS, EVEN NOW, I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHEN THE PART WILL ARRIVE AND WHEN I WILL BE ABLE TO USE MY CAR AGAIN.  THE DEALER HAS ALSO TOLD ME THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CARS IN THE LOT WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  I AM NOT ALONE.  GIVEN THAT THIS PART IS DEFECTIVE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT VOLVO SHOULD BE RUNNING A NATIONAL RECALL ON THIS PART.  I SUSPECT THE REASON THAT THEY ARE NOT, IS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE PART AND ARE NOT SURE WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT.  THIS IS NO EXCUSE.  FROM AN IRATE VOLVO OWNER (ONE OF MANY RIGHT NOW) WHO BOUGHT THIS CAR TO DRIVE AS OPPOSED TO SIT IN THE DEALERS LOT.  *JB",
