THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER AND THEY WANTED TO INSTALL A KIT THAT WILL \"WAKE UP THE MOTOR\" TO MAKE THE SEAT GO FORWARD AND BACK AND THAT THIS WAS THE RECOMMENDED FIX.   *TT   NISSAN'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT INFORMED THE CONSUMER THAT THERE ARE FOUR MOTORS THAT CONTROL THE DRIVER'S SEAT.  ONLY THE MOTOR THAT CONTROLS THE FORWARD AND BACKWARD MOVEMENT FALLS ASLEEP.  THIS PROBLEM WOULD HAPPEN FREQUENTLY ON LOWER MILEAGE VEHICLE'S THAT ARE STILL UNDER WARRANTY.   *SC *JB",
