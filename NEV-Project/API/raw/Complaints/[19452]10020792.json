ALOS TOLD TO BE CAREFUL DRIVNG ON WET PAVEMENT AS THE BRAKING WOULD NOT BE AS SAFE W/O THE ABS SYTEM WORKING.  CONTACTED CHEVY AND NEGOTIATED THE REPLACEMENT OF THE ABS MODULE, HOWEVER UPON AGREEING TO PAY FOR 1/2 THE COST THE CHEVY FOLKS RAISE THE INITIAL $500 DEALER QUOTE TO $899 WHICH WOULD NOT INCLUDE THE LABOR.  AS THE SAFETY IS LESS WHEN ON WET PAYMENT I AM L;OOKING FOR A RECALL OF THIS ABS SYSTEM.  THE CHEVY MECHAINC SAY IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM WIHT THE USSUAL COURSE OF ACTION BEING TO PULL THE FUSE AND RUN WITH THE BRAKE WARNING LIGHT ON.  AS I HAVE LEASED THIS VEHICLE I HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD BY THE LEASING COMPANY I WILL HAVE TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM BEFORE IT IS ACCEPTED BACK WHEN THE LEASE EXPIRES.  I HAVE COPIIES OF ALL THE COREESPONDANCE WITH THE CHEVY FOLKS ITF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM.",
