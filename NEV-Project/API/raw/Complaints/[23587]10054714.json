I SUSTAINED MULTIPLE INJURIES INCLUDING A WHIPLASH INJURY AS WELL AS INJURIES OF MY BACK AND LEFT SHOULDER THAT I BELIEVE WERE EXACERBATED BY THE SEAT BACK ASSUMING A FAIRLY RECLINED POSITION.  I ALSO FEAR THAT IF EITHER OF MY CHILDREN HAD BEEN SITTING BEHIND THE DRIVERS SEAT (ESPECIALLY IN A REAR-FACING INFANT SEAT) THEY COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED AS A RESULT OF THIS FAILURE OF THE SEAT BACK. THE VOLVO DEALER/REPAIR SHOP HAS IMPLIED THAT MY WEIGHT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS FAILURE. I WEIGHED ABOUT 218-222 POUNDS AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.   *LA",
