THE SOUND ONLY EXISTED WHEN I PUT THE VEHICLE TO REVERSE.  HOWEVER, NEAR THE 20,000 MILES POINT, THE SOUND HAS BECOME LOUDER AND EXIST EVEN WHEN DRIVING FORWARD AND BRAKING.  I HAVE REPORTED THIS PROBLEM TO THREE DIFFERENT TOYOTA DEALERSHIPS AND THEY ARE UNABLE TO REPAIR IT.      THE PROBLEM OCCURS WHEN I NEED TO STOP THE VEHICLE AND PUSH ON THE BRAKE PEDAL.  THERE WOULD BE A LOUD GRINDING NOISE AND SOMETIMES THE BRAKE PEDAL WOULD ALSO VIBRATE.  THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIPS HAVE CHANGED MY BRAKE PADS AND PERFORMED SEVERAL INSPECTIONS.  HOWEVER, IT DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  NOW THEY ARE REFUSING TO DO ANYTHING AND CLAIMS THAT THE PROBLEM IS NORMAL (AT NEARLY 60,000 MILES).  I FEEL THAT THERE IS SOMETHING REALLY WRONG AND UNSAFE ABOUT THE SITUATION.  WHAT IF THE BRAKES FAIL AT ANY MOMENT?  WHAT STEPS SHOULD I TAKE?  EVEN TOYOTA CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE SERVICE IS TELLING ME THAT THE DEALER DIAGNOSTIC SAYS IT IS A NORMAL CONDITION.   *TR",
