I CALLED THE PONTIAC DEALER AND WAS TOLD \"YES, WE HAVE THEM IN STOCK, THEY FALL OFF ALL THE TIME\".  THE BARGAIN PRICE WAS $70, WHICH I HAVE REPLACED WITH PLASTIC FOR NOW BECAUSE OF BUDGET PURPOSES, ONLY TO HAVE THE LEFT SIDE FALL OFF 2 MONTHS LATER.  SHOULDN'T THIS BE A RECALL IF IT \"HAPPENS ALL THE TIME\"??",
