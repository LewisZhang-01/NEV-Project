NEAR THE END OF MY 45 MINUTE MORNING COMMUTE, AS I WAS SLOWING TO GO THROUGH A TRAFFIC LIGHT, MY VEHICLE STALLED AND I LOST POWER STEERING AND BRAKING ABILITIES.  LUCKILY, I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION AND THEN RESTARTED THE CAR AND WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.  THIS WAS THE 2ND TIME THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED - THE FIRST WAS SHORTLY AFTER I FIRST PURCHASED THE CAR (IN EARLY 2002).  I TOOK IT TO MY DEALER AND EXPLAINED THE ISSUE.  UPON INVESTIGATION, THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM.  I AM NOT SURE IF THIS IS RELATED, BUT I HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED NUMEROUS 'FALSE' WARNING LIGHTS THAT THE DEALER HAS BEEN UNABLE TO REPRODUCE.",
