        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING THE CAR ON THE EXPRESSWAY OR ANYWHERE FOR THAT MATTER THE CAR ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AND THE \"OVER DRIVE OFF\" LIGHT BEGINS TO BLINK AND MY OVERDRIVE TURN OFF.  I USUALLY HAVE TO PULL OVER TO THE SHOULDER OR AT A RED LIGHT AND TURN THE CAR OFF AND BACK ON TO FIX IT.  THIS IS VERY UNSAFE AND ANNOYING BECAUSE IT HAPPENS ALMOST EVERYDAY.  I HAVE TO DO THIS DURING RUSH HOUR ON I-294 IN CHICAGO.  I AM RELUCTANT TO TAKE IT TO MAZDA REPAIR BECAUSE THEY CHARGE $100 JUST TO TAKE THE CAR IN THE SHOP AND THEY TRY TO FIND LITTLE WAYS TO SLAP ON A BIGGER BILL.  I HAD THEM CHANGE MY TRANSMISSION FLUID AND A WEEK LATER IT LEAKED AND THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS A HOLE IN THE TRANSMISSION.  APPARENTLY IT WAS NOT THERE BEFORE THE TRANSMISSION FLUID CHANGE AND THEY DID NOT NOTICE IT DURING.  SO I HAD THEM JUST REFILL IT AND I ADDED SEALANT FROM AUTO ZONE.  I CHECKED  MY TRANSMISSION FLUID WEEKLY AND ITS JUST FINE.  ENGINE LIGHT COMES AND GOES AT WILL.  THERE SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH THE COMPUTER CHIP OR SOMETHING WHICH IS MAZDA'S FAULT AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY TO REPLACE OR FIX.  EVERYTHING ON THE CAR IS STOCKED AND I MAINTAIN THE CAR BETTER THAN MAZDA SUGGESTS.  I CHECK ALL FLUIDS, OIL CHANGE EVERY 2000 MILES, ETC...  I KNOW THAT  MANY PEOPLE (THOUSANDS OF THEM) THAT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH THE ENGINE LIGHTS AND THE \"OVER DRIVE OFF\" LIGHT BLINKING.  *JB",
