THE DEALER ASKED FOR ONE MORE CHANCE TO FIX THE VEHICLE -- THEY FAILED AND NOW ARE SAYING I MUST BRING THE CAR IN TO \"PROVE\" THE PROBLEM.  THE PROBLEM OCCURS ABOUT 70% OF THE TIME THOUGH SO MAY NOT DISPLAY SUCH A PROBLEM WHEN AND IF I DO BRING IT IN AGAIN.  VW SHOULD BE PROFESSIONAL AND DEAL WITH THIS HUGE NATIONAL PROBLEM BETTER -- THEY EXPECT CONSUMERS TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD SPEND WEEKS AND LOANER CARS TO FIX A PROBLEM THEY NEVER HAVE REALLY EXPERIENCED.  YOUR CONSUMER IS NOT STUPID VW!  THOUSANDS OF OWNERS WILL NOT BACK DOWN OR HO AWAY. I INTEND TO FILE A LEMON LAW COMPLAINT.   *NLM",
