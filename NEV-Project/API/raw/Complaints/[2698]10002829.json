        "summary": "FOLLOWING A ROUTINE OIL CHANGE SERVICE BY A SEARS AUTO CENTER MY TRANSMISSION BEGAN TO MALFUNCTION. I CHECKED THE FLUID LEVEL AND FOUND IT OVER-FILLED BY OVER A PINT. I PULLED THE EXCESS OUT TO GET IT TO THE PROPER LEVEL. WHEN IT CONTINUED TO GET WORSE I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER. THEY FOUND PARTICLES IN THE PAN AND SAID THE TRANSMISSION HAD TO BE REPLACED. TS    IN TALKING TO THE SEARS AUTO CENTER ABOUT THE ISSUE, IT WAS REVEALED THEY DO NOT EVEN CARRY THE PROPER ATF (ATF+3 OR +4) FOR CHRYSLER TRANSMISSIONS. OBVIOUSLY, WHEN THEY \"TOPPED IT OFF\" THEY USED DEXRON/MERCON.    CURIOUS IF SEARS AUTO CENTERS GENERALLY DID THE SAME, I CHECKED WITH ANOTHER CENTER AND FOUND THE SAME PROCEDURE (I.E. USING THE WRONG FLUID) TO BE IN PLACE, ALTHOUGH THEIR SERVICE MANUAL SPECS TELL THEM TO USE ONLY ATF +3 IN THAT CHRYSLER TRANSMISSION.    IT APPEARS THIS MAY BE A LARGER PROBLEM THAN LOCAL AND COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE POOR RECORD OF CHRYSLER TRANSMISSIONS IN RECENT YEARS. IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THIS HAS NOT SURFACED (OR MADE PUBLIC) BY EITHER SEARS OR CHRYSLER.",
