THIS HAS BEEN OCCURRING FOR THE PAST 15,000 MILES.  FORD WAS UNABLE TO FIX THIS PROBLEM, BUT TALKING WITH OTHERS WHO TOOK SAFETY MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS FOUND THE FUEL PUMPS NOT KEEPING ADEQUATE FUEL FLOW TO THE ENGINE.  MY CAR IS AT THE DEALERSHIP NOW WITH SPECIFIC DIRECTION TO REPLACE THIS AT MY COST.  WHEN A CAR VIOLENTLY STALLS ON THE HIGHWAY AROUND A CORNER, IT'S NOT SAFE. PLEASE RECOMMEND TO FORD TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE IS INJURED.        *JB",
