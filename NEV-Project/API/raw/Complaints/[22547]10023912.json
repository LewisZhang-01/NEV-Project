THIS IS ACTUALLY THE SECOND TIME THIS HAS OCCURRED IN THIS VEHICLE, WITH THE FIRST INCIDENT IN JULY OF 2001 (3 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR). IT WAS REPLACED THEN BY THE DEALERSHIP, AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A ONE-TIME OCCURRENCE, HOWEVER THE SAME PROBLEM HAS SURFACED AGAIN ON JUNE 7TH OF THIS YEAR, AGAIN NEEDING TO HAVE THE SEAT BE REPLACED. THIS NOT ONLY MAKES IT HIGHLY PAINFUL TO DRIVE, IT LEAVES ME WITH BACK PAIN FOR HOURS AFTERWARDS BECAUSE THE RESULT IS SITTING ON STEEL BARS.  *JB",
