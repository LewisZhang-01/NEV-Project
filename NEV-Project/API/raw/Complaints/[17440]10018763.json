I WAS HAVING TERRIBLE OVER HEATING PROBLEMS, SUDDENLY WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY ONE DAY AND I  STOPPED AND OPENED THE RADIATOR IT LOOKED LIKE BLACK SLUDGE. AFTER TAKING IT TO BE FIXED I FIND IT IS THE COOLANT THAT CHEVY INSTALLS CALLED DEXCOOL AND IT IS CAUSING ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS FOR MOST CHEVY CONSUMERS. WHAT CAN WE DO? I HAVE TO HAVE A NEW ENGINE AFTER THEY EMPTIED OUT 1/2 GALLON OF THE SLUDGE FROM MY VEHICLE.
