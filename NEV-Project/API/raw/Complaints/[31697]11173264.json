NOTICED MUCH WORSE WITH NEW TIRES THAT GRIP WELL. HAVE HAD IT INSPECTED BY A PROFESSIONAL WHO SAYS ALL VITAL PARTS LOOK OKAY. 4 WHEEL ALIGNMENT DID NOT REMEDY. I SEE REFERENCES TO A DESIGN ISSUE WITH THE UPPER CONTROL MEMBERS THAT MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH A CORRECT CAMBER SETTING. I DON'T TRUST MUCH ON THE INTERNET THOUGH, AND WOULD LIKE NHTSA GUIDANCE OR FURTHER INFORMATION. THANKS FOR ANY HELP YOU CAN PROVIDE, I APPRECIATE IT.",
