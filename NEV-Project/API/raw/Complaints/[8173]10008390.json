SO I TOOK IT TO A CARE PLACE AND THE HOOKED IT TO THE COMPUTER IT SAID A BAD PASSENGER REAR SENSOR.  $200  LATER THE PROBLEM WASN'T FIXED.  NOW THEY SAY IT IS THE MAIN MODULAR SENSOR OH THAT'S $700.  WELL THE BAD THING IS I KNOW OF 2 OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.  THIS CAR IS SUPPOSE TO BE A SAFE VEHICLE.  BUT I'M NOT IMPRESSED AND WOULD NEVER BUY ONE AGAIN.  I THINK WITH THIS MANY COMPLAINTS THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL.   *NLM",
