DIAGNOSED AS A FAILED INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET, COST TO REPAIR APPROX $900.00.  ON DISASSEMBLY, DEALER CONTACTED ME WITH INFORMATION THAT THE ENGINE INTERNALS WERE SO BADLY FOULED (SLUDGE AND DEPOSITS) THAT THE HYDRAULIC LIFTERS REQUIRED REPLACEMENT.  I ASKED WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS SITUATION, SINCE THE VAN HAS ALWAYS GOTTEN REGULAR OIL CHANGES EVERY 3000 MILES, WITH NEW FILTER AND CORRECT OIL, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO DIFFERENTLY TO AVOID THIS SAME PROBLEM AGAIN.  NO INFORMATION OR ADVICE WAS OFFERED ON WHY THE GASKET FAILED, OR WHY THE ENGINE WAS SO BADLY FOULED.",
