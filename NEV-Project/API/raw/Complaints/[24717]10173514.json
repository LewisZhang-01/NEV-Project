FOUND THE PLASTIC RETAINER HOLDING THE MAIN FUEL LINE CRACKED AND ALLOWED THE FUEL LINE TO COME LOOSE SPRAYING GAS OVER THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR. THEY WILL PUT ANOTHER PLASTIC RETAINER ON THE LINE BUT HOW LONG WILL THAT LAST? CONSIDER THIS A MAJOR DEFECT AND COULD LEAD TO VEHICLE FIRES WHICH COULD BE DEADLY. I WAS LUCKY BUT SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT NOT BE. I DO NOT LIKE THE FIX. A BETTER FORM OF LINE CLAMPING SHOULD BE USED. I NOTIFIED GM AND THERE IS NO RECALLS AT THIS TIME. THEY TOOK THE INFORMATION AND PUT IT ON FILE. I WOULD LIKE TO BE COMPENSATED FOR TOWING AND THE LOST FUEL. GM WILL NOT DO THIS. NOTE:THE CAR IS AT KNEBEL AUTO IN HIGHLAND ILL NOT THE DEALER BECAUSE IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY. *JB",
