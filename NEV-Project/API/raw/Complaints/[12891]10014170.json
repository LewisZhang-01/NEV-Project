MY INSURANCE COMPANY INSISTS THAT IT WILL ONLY PAY FOR AFTER MARKET PARTS, NOT OEM PARTS.  FURTHER, THEY TELL ME THE AFTER MARKET PARTS CARRY NO CERTIFICATION THAT THEY ARE EQUAL TO THE OEM PARTS.  I WOULD NOT FEEL SAFE USING PARTS THAT ARE SAFETY RELATED THAT CANNOT BE CERTIFIED TO BE OF THE SAME KIND AND TYPE AS ORIGINALLY INSTALLED.  DOES NHTSA HAVE A POSITION OF THE USE OF NON-OEM SAFETY PARTS IN THE REPAIR OF AN AUTOMOBILE?  *JB",
