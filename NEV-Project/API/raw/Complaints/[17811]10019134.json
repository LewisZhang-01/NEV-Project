THIS IS A VERY COSTLY REPAIR (LABOR IS 675.00) I CALLED FORD TO COMPLAIN AND WAS TOLD NO RECALLS AND NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS. I FOUND OUT TODAY THAT THERE  HAS BEEN PROBLEMS WITH THE HEATER CORE AND A TSB HAD BEEN RELEASED ABOUT IT. I THINK FORD SHOULD HAVE TO REFUND ME THE MONEY I HAVE SPENT ON HAVING IT FIXED AND HAVE IT FIXED ACCORDING TO THE TSB ALSO! I HAVE HAD LOTS OF PROBLEMS WITH MY CAR SINCE I BOUGHT IT AND ALL OF THEM SEEM TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF TSB OUT ABOUT THEM, WHY IS FORD NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR FIXING THESE KNOWN PROBLEMS??    *NLM    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
