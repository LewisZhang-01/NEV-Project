        "summary": "ENGINE STALLS ON 1.8L 5 SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSION.  SINCE PURCHASING IN NOV 2006 THE ENGINE HAS STALLED OVER 20 TIMES IN VARIOUS SITUATIONS.  THE COMMON FACTOR IS WHEN COMING TO AN IDOL THE RPM'S WILL DROP TO APPROXIMATELY 500 THEN COME BACK UP TO IDOL AT ABOUT 800-1000.  IT USUALLY STALLS WHEN IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC BUT HAS STALLED IN UNSAFE CONDITIONS AT LEAST 5 TIMES.  WHEN PUSHING IN THE CLUTCH TO DOWNSHIFT WHILE MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN ACROSS TRAFFIC LANES IT HAS STALLED.  THIS CAUSED ME TO LOOSE POWER STEERING AND FORCED ME TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE STEERING WHEEL, RESTART THE CAR AND SHIFT INTO THE APPROPRIATE GEAR WHILE BROADSIDE TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER TWICE AND MOST RECENTLY TOLD THAT DODGE SAYS IT'S THE WAY THE ELECTRONICS FOR SHIFTING ARE CONNECTED OR SOMETHING OF THAT SORT.  THE ENGINE LIGHT HAS COME ON TWICE BEFORE AND WENT OUT THE FOLLOWING DAY.  THE DEALERSHIP STATED IT HAD STORED A STALL CODE.  THE ENGINE LIGHT IS BACK ON TODAY.  *JB",
