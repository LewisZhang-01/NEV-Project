WHEN WE PICKED IT UP WE DROVE IT FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 MILES AND STOPPED BECAUSE IT WAS SO HOT, WE CALLED THE DEALER AND TOLD THEM ABOUT IT BEING HOT. THEY ACTED AS IF IT WAS NORMAL. WE TOOK THE BIKE IN FOR THE RECALL THAT BRP HAD REQUESTED. THEY DID THE RECALL BUT THE HEAT ISSUE REMAINED. I ASKED THE DEALER TO CALL BRP AND SEE IF SOMETHING COULD BE DONE ABOUT THE HEAT. WE WERE TOLD THAT BRP SAID IT WAS ONLY A HEAT ISSUE IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.  WE CHANGED DEALERSHIP FOR MAINTENANCE, THEY CONTACTED BRP AND I WAS GIVEN A CLAIM NUMBER. THEY INSTRUCTED THE DEALERSHIP TO WRAP THE EXHAUST AND TO PUT HEAT SHIELDS ON EACH SIDE OF THE BIKE. NO MORE WILL BE DONE FOR THE HEAT ISSUE TO MY SPYDER. A MECHANIC PUT A GUN TO THE BIKE AFTER I GOT OFF, HE LIFTED THE SEAT AND THE HEAT REGISTERED 174 DEGREES AND YOU CAN HEAR THE GAS BUBBLING IN THE TANK. I DON'T WANT MY BIKE TO CATCH ON FIRE. BUT IT GETS SO HOT IT'S SCARY.  *TR",
