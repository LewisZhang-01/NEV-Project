THIS IS A PART THAT YOU CAN'T WEAR & TEAR, YET IT DOESN'T HAVE A LIFETIME WARRANTY AND IT COSTS $570 (THAT I CAN'T AFFORD) TO REPLACE. IF THE UNIT ISN'T REPLACED, THE AIRBAGS AND SEATBELTS MIGHT NOT WORK PROPERLY. THE RESEARCH THAT I'VE DONE INDICATED THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH MOST HONDAS (CIVICS, ACCORDS, CR-VS, THE ODYSSEY...) AND YET HONDA HAS DONE NOTHING TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM AND DON'T OFFER EXTENDED/LIFETIME WARRANTIES. *TR",
