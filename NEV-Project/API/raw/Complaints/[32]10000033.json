OTHER MANUFACTURERS DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM. I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE X5 SUV IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST VEHICLE MADE TO DRIVE IN FRONT OF AT NIGHT. I HAVE HAD TO PULL OVER TO AVOID BEING BLINDED.THIS PROBLEM HAS OCCURED IN THE THREE DIFFERENT VEHCILES THAT I DRIVE, SO HEIGHT OF MY VEHICLE IS NOT A CONTRIBUTING FACOR. I FEEL THAT THESE LIGHTS ARE DANGEROUS AND SHOULD BE REDESIGNED",
