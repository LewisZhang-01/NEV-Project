THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME, THE LIGHT COMES ON THAT SHOWS THAT MY FRONT PASSENGER AIRBAG IS NOT ON AND ALSO THAT THE PASSENGER IS NOT  BUCKLED, WHETHER THEY ARE BUCKLED, OR THERE ISN'T A PASSENGER IN THAT SEAT AT ALL.  WHETHER I AM STATIONARY OR DRIVING/MOVING AT ANY SPEED, THOSE WARNING LIGHTS ARE ON, AND WILL INTERMITTENTLY GO OFF FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME, THEN THEY COME BACK ON AGAIN. I AM IN A CARPOOL SO I FREQUENTLY AM THE DRIVER AND I HAVE SOMEONE IN THAT FRONT PASSENGER SEAT. I AM CONCERNED THAT IF IN AN ACCIDENT, THE AIRBAG WILL NOT DEPLOY CAUSING INJURIES IN THE CASE OF AN ACCIDENT. NEWER MODELS OF THE SAME CAR HAVE THIS SEAT SENSOR ON RECALL, SO THE 2006 SHOULD ALSO BE RECALLED.",
