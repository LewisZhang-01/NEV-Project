WHEN I TURNED THE CAR OFF, I LIFTED THE HOOD THINKING THERE WOULD BE A PROBLEM IN THERE.  I COULD HERE WHAT SOUNDED LIKE SOMETHING BOILING.  THEN I WALKED AROUND THE CAR UNTILL I GOT TO THE GAS TANK.  THATS WHERE I COULD REALLY SMELL THE GAS.  I LOOKED UNDER THE CAR AND THERE WAS GAS DRIPPING FROM THE GAS TANK.  MY CAR ONLY HAS 24000 MILES ON IT, AND ONLY A MONTH OUT OF WARRANTY. SO I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A LOCAL GARAGE THINKING THAT MAYBE IT WAS JUST A CRACK IN THE FUEL LINE.  WHAT WAS FOUND OUT IS MY CAR  HAS A PLASTIC GAS TANK AND HAS BROKEN AT THE SEAMS.  THE BOILING NOISE I HEARD WAS THE GAS SPITTING ON THE EXHAUST.  THE MECHANIC SAID I WAS LUCKY THAT THE CAR DID NOT CATCH ON FIRE.  SO I CALLED FORD TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD DO SINCE IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE GAS TANK WAS FAULTY.  THEY SAID THEY WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING UNTILL I GOT THE CAR TO MY FORD SERVICE STATION.  I WILL HAVE TO CALL THEM AND SEE WHAT THEY WILL HAVE TO SAY.  I HOPE I DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR FORDS MISTAKE.  HOW CAN THEY EXPECT A PLASTIC GAS TANK TO LAST, WHEN MINE HAS BUSTED AT ONLY 24000 MILES.",
