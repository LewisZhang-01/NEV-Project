I WAS ABLE TO BRING IT BACK UP BY FOLDING THE EXTERIOR PASSENGER SEAT TO PROVIDE SOME SORT OF SUPPORT. WHEN I ARRIVED HOME I TRIED INSPECTING WHAT THE ISSUE WAS AND SAW A LARGE FRACTURE RIGHT NEXT TO THE RECLINING MECHANISM. THIS IS POTENTIALLY A HAZARD THAT CAN ONE DAY CAUSE A SEVERE ACCIDENT. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN DRIVING SLOW BUT IF I WERE TO BE IN THE FREEWAY THEN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS. THIS LARGE FRACTURE SEEMS TO DERIVE FROM A POORLY DESIGNED SEAT THAT WEAK METAL OF SOME SORT.   *TR",
