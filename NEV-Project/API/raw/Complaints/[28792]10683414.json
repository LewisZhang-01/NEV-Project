        "summary": "2007 CHEVY UPLANDER CV AXLE SPLINES NOT LONG ENOUGH TO FIT ALL THE WAY INTO HUB SPLINES CAUSE SHUDDERING AND HESITATION FROM CV AXLE OFF BALANCE WOBBLE. FREQUENT CLICKING FROM CHANGING GEAR TO GEAR WHILE VEHICLE STILL IS A RESULT OF THE CV AXLE SPINNING INSIDE THE HUB (PRESS BRAKE AND GAS) THE REMEDY FOR THIS PROBLEM OF SHUDDERING AND STALLING WHEN AT A GO FROM A STOP OR CLICKING WHILE TRANSITIONING TO SLOWING DOWN IS TO REPLACE THE CV AXLE WITH ONE THAT HAS A LONGER SHAFT WITH SPLINES THAT ACTUALLY EXTEND THROUGH THE HUB SO THAT THE HUB NUT THREADS DO NOT ENTER THE HUB BEARING AND THE CV AXLE SPLINES RUN ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE HUB (INSTEAD OF PARTIALLY/LESS THAN HALFWAY). THE WOBBLING ON TAKE OFF IS FROM THE AXLE NOT GRIPPING INSIDE THE HUB, SORT OF LIKE A DRADLE, AS THE HUB DOES NOT COMPLETELY GRIP THE AXLE SHAFT THE CENTRIPETAL FORCE GOES OFF BALANCE. AS SHOWN IN THE VIDEO LINK BELOW YOU WILL SEE THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF THE ERRORS CONCERNING THIS ISSUE. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ONE WOULD PLACE A ROD THROUGH THE CENTER OF A WASHER AND WHIRLED IT AROUND LIKE A JUMP ROPE . OFF BALANCE AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED IT WILL RIP THROUGH AS SHOWN BELOW.
