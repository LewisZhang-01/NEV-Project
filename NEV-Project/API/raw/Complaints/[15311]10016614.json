IN EACH OCCURRENCE THE BRAKE PEDAL STRONGLY RESISTS FOOT PRESSURE, BRAKING ACTION IS MINIMAL-TO-NONEXISTENT, AND THE ABS UNIT EMITS A GROANING/GRINDING SOUND FROM VICINITY OF THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  IN THESE SITUATIONS THERE IS A HIGH RISK OF COLLISION WITH STATIONARY VEHICLES AHEAD IN TRAFFIC.  AS GREATER PRESSURE IS APPLIED TO THE BRAKE PEDAL IN AN ATTEMPT TO STOP THE VEHICLE, IN SOME INSTANCES THE FAULTY ABS ACTION ABRUPTLY ENDS - CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO JERK TO A SUDDEN STOP.  THIS BEHAVIOR RISKS CAUSING A COLLISION BY CLOSELY FOLLOWING VEHICLES.  AFTER EACH OF THESE MALFUNCTIONS, THE ABS LIGHT ON THE CONSOLE APPEARS AND THERE ARE NO FURTHER MALFUNCTIONS DURING THAT PARTICULAR TRIP. DRIVER HAS REMOVED THE ABS FUSE TO PREVENT THE PROBLEM FROM RE- OCCURRING.   *NLM",
