THE PROBLEM IS BACK, I BELIEVE THIS THIS IS THE THIRD TRIP BACK SINCE THE LAST CLUTCH WAS PUT IN. FORD KEEPS SAYING IT'S NOT BACK ENOUGH TO REPLACE, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PAPER WORK IT SAYS THEY READJUSTED THE CLUTCH, EACH TIME. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE MILEAGE IN AND OUT OF THE SHOP IT'S THE SAME. HOW CAN THEY SAY THE PROBLEM NOT THERE. IF THEY DON'T DRIVE IT? IT'S TO THE POINT NOW THAT YOU DON'T DARE TRY TO PASS OR GO BY ANOTHER CAR BECAUSE IT HESITATES SO BAD AND THE TEC METER WILL JUMP TO 5/5 1/2 BEFORE IT DROPS DOWN AND SHIFTS GEARS. IT'S LIKE DRIVING A CAR WITH A STANDARD TRANSMISSION AND THE CLUTCH ISN'T OUT FAR ENOUGH.",
