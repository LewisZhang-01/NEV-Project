        "summary": "I HAVE A 1994 LINCOLN TOWN CAR WHICH HAS BEEN ALWAYS SERVICED AT GALPIN LINCOLN MERCURY DEALER.  EVERY TWO YEARS AFTER 1998, THE BLEND DOOR MOTOR HAD TO BE REPLACED.  THE FIRST REPLACEMENT THE VEHICLE WAS STILL UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. (01/02/98) THE SECOND TIME, 12/18/00, $389.54. AGAIN 12/02, THE PROBLEM BEGAN AGAIN.  I WENT BACK TO GALPIN AND REPORTED IT AND I WAS TOLD THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE AND IT WAS VERY STRANGE THAT IT HAPPENS EVERY TWO YEARS.  I WAS REFERRED TO DETRIOT CUSTOMER SERVICE.  THEY TOO STATED NOTHING COULD BE DONE.  I CALLED GALPLIN CUSTOMER SERVICE AND LEFT A MESSAGE ON THE VOICE MAIL OF THE CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER.  HE NEVER RETURNED MY CALL.  IF THIS PROBLEM HAPPENS EVERY TWO YEARS, I FEEL THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM THAT LINCOLN MANUFACTURES DO NOT WANT TO ADMIT.  I DID NOT HAVE THE REPAIR COMPLETED THIS TIME BECAUSE THE BILL SHOULD FALL ON THE DEALER.",
