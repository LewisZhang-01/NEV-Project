        "summary": "I HAD A 2007 GMC SIERRA. THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF THIS VEHICLE I'VE ASK WHY THE 5.3L MOTOR BURNS A QUART OF OIL OR MORE DURING OIL CHANGES. CONSTANTLY ASK MULTIPLE DEALERS TO INSPECT AND THEY CONTINUED TO STATE THAT'S JUST THIS ENGINE AND WOULD NEVER MARK PAPERWORK TO CHECK. ALWAYS STATED IT WILL BURN A LITTLE OIL IN BETWEEN OIL CHANGES. I CONTINUED TO BELIEVE THIS AS OTHER OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE TYPE TOLD ME SAME INFORMATION. ON OR AROUND FEB 7, 2014 ENGINE DROPPED CYLINDERS AND LOST MOST POWER TO VEHICLE WHILE ON INTERSTATE. I'M CONCERNED AS IT LOST POWER AND DRAMATICALLY SLOWED BUT ALSO THAT I'VE HAD A FAULTY PRODUCT SINCE BUYING AND NO RECALL WAS ISSUED. I MAINTENANCED THIS VEHICLE PROPERLY. AFTER TELLING ME THE COST TO REPLACE THE 2 CYLINDERS OR ENGINE I HAD A DECISION TO MAKE. THIS ENGINE SHOULD BE RECALLED AS IT HAS MAJOR PROBLEMS. UNFORTUNATELY GM DIDN'T RECALL THE ENGINE AND FIX IT PROPERLY WITHIN MY WARRANTY TIMEFRAME. I EVEN BOUGHT EXTENDED WARRANTY. NOW I'VE HAD TO BUY NEW TRUCK WHICH I WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT IF ENGINE WAS STILL RUNNING IN 2007 GMC TRUCK. THESE \"ECO\" ENGINES NEED TO BE REVIEWED.   *TR",
