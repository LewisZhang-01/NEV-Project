AFTER TAKING IT TO A DEALER THE CAR WAS FOUND TO BE SENDING IMPROPER SIGNALS TO THE ENGINE THAT SHUT OFF THE FUEL PUMP AND WOULDN'T ALLOW THE CAR TO START.       IT SEEMED THAT SWITCHING THE KEY OUT TO THE SECOND KEY THAT CAME WITH THE CAR IT WAS FIXED BUT ON 02/25 THE SAME ISSUES STARTED AGAIN AND THE CAR WILL START AND RUN FINE ONCE IT DECIDES TO TURN ON.      AFTER SEEING THE RECALL INFORMATION FROM GM I BELIEVE THE ISSUE WE HAVE IS THE PRECURSOR TO THEY IGNITION ISSUE WITH THE OTHER 2003-2007 MODELS OF SATURNS.  *TR",
