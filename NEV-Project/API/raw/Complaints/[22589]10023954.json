IT LURCHES AND JERKS AND SLIPS GEARS. THE MITSUBISHI SERVICE DEPT. TRIED TO TELL ME NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH IT--WHEN I TOOK THE TECHNICIAN FOR A RIDE WE GOT TEN FEET AND IT JERKED AND CLICKED INTO GEAR--THEY SAY THE TRANSMISSION BODY VALVE IS FAILING--ORDERED THE PART--TOLD ME IT WAS SAFE TO DRIVE THE CAR UNTIL IT IS FIXED EVEN THOUGH IT IS GETTING WORSE EVERYDAY, AND I AM LEARY OF DRIVING IT ON THE FREEWAY. IT IS UNDER WARRANTY, BUT I FEEL EITHER THIS IS A DEFECT OR I GOT A LEMON. MORE TO COME AFTER THE REPAIR.   *NLM",
