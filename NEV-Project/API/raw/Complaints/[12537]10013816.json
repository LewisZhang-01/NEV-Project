THE PREVIOUS MONDAY I HAD MY OIL CHANGED AT THE LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALER AND THOUGHT THAT MAYBE SOMETHING MAY BE WRONG WITH THE FILTER. ON MONDAY THE 31ST OF MAR I TALKED TO THE SERVICE MGR AND HE TOLD ME TO BRING IT IN. HE LOOKED UNDER THE HOOD AND UNDER THE ENGINE AND FOUND THAT IT WAS A POWER STEERING LEAK NOT AN OIL LEAK. HE STATED THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 300M. I STATED THAT THIS SEEMS TO BE MFG'ING PROBLEM. HE STATED IT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO ALL OF THEM SO THAT IS WHY IT WAS NOT A RECALL OR SERVICE BULLETIN. I DISAGREE WITH HIS STATEMENT. I HAD EXTENDED WARRANTY TO THEY FIXED IT AND IT COST ME $100.00 DEDUCTIBLE. I FEEL THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE PAID FOR. ACCORDING TO THIS DEALER THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH THE 300M AND IT SHOULD BE IDENTIFIED AS A RECALL OR AT LEAST A SERVICE BULLETIN.  *NLM",
