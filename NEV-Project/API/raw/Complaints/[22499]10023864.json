MY CAR HAS BEEN TO DEALERSHIP AND TO REPAIR CENTERS AND ALL COMPANIES SAY THEY THERE IS NOTHING WRONG.  THE SOLUTION EACH TIME WAS JUST TO REPLACE THE SENSOR, HOWEVER, EVEN DRIVING OUT OF DEALERSHIP  THE ABS LIGHT WENT  ON.  I HAVE READ IN THE PAST SIMILAR INSTANCES WITH ABS PROBLEMS, IS THERE EVER GOING TO BE A RECALL, OR IS IT GOING TO TAKE A SERIOUS LAWSUIT/ACCIDENT  BEFORE THE PROBLEM GETS FIXED?  I ALSO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE RIGHT PASSENGER SEAT HANDLE BREAKING, AND IT IS STILL BROKEN.  *JB",
