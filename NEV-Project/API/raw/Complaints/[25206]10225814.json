THEY SAID THAT A \"PRISTINE\" PEBBLE HAD DESTROYED THE CONDENSER, AND THAT IT WAS NOT A MECHANICAL ERROR SO IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY. I BELIEVE THAT THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS REPORTED OF SIMILAR OCCURRENCES PROVES THAT IT IS A MECHANICAL ERROR DUE TO POOR ENGINEERING.   OF THE PLACEMENT OF THE AC CONDENSER. THERE ARE HUGE OPENINGS BENEATH THE FRONT BUMPER THAT LET ROAD DEBRIS & ROCKS IN WITHOUT ANY PROTECTION. THE AC CONDENSER IS \"RIGHT THERE\" WITH A SCREEN OR ANYTHING TO PROTECT IT. BESIDES THE AC NOT WORKING AND HONDA OWNERS HAVING TO SHELL OUT 700-800 TO GET THE CONDENSER REPLACED, THE INITIAL IMPACT BY A ROCK TO THE CONDENSER EMPTIES THE FREON OUT INTO THE ATMOSPHERE!  *TR",
