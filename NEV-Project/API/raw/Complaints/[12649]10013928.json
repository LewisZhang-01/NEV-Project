AFTER SITTING IN A RAIN OR SNOW STORM, THE LOWER HALF OF THE TRUNK LINING, FROM THE TOP OF THE SPARE TIRE DOWN, GETS SOAKED WITH WATER, WITH NO OBVIOUS INDICATION AS TO WHERE IT'S COMING INTO THE SPARE TIRE AREA. THE  COVER OVER THE SPARE TIRE DOESN'T GET WET. AFTER PARTIALLY REMOVING THE TRUNK LINING, FOUND SOME WATER ON TOP OF TRUNK NEAR THE BACK SEAT, BUT CAN'T BE SURE THAT IS THE PROBLEM, OR EVEN WHERE IT WOULD COME FROM TO GET ON THERE AND NO WHERE ELSE.",
