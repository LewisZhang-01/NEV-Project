        "summary": "I HAVE A 2004 FORD FOCUS.  I PARKED MY VEHICLE AT CHURCH ON SUNDAY AND WHEN I CAME OUT - I PUT MY KEY IN THE IGNITION TO START MY CAR AND IT WAS LOCKED UP.  NO MATTER WHAT I TRIED I COULDN'T TURN THE KEY OR START MY CAR.  I CALLED MY BROTHER-IN-LAW TO COME HELP ME.  HE TRIED TO AND NOTHING WORKED.  HE HAD THE SUGGESTION TO LOOK ON THE INTERNET - TO LOOK UP FORD FOCUS AND KEY WON'T TURN ON GOOGLE.  I DID JUST THAT - AND THERE WERE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS OF THIS HAPPENING TO PEOPLE THAT HAD FORD FOCUS'S.  A SUGGESTION ON THERE - WAS TO GET A SMALL HAMMER OR THE END OF A SCREW DRIVER AND WHILE YOU PUT THE KEY IN THE IGNITION - PUSH IT REAL HARD AND HIT THE KEY WITH A HAMMER.  IT WORKED!  MY KEY MOVED TO THE START POSITION AND I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE MY CAR HOME.  THE WEBSITE THAT TOLD US TO TRY THAT SAID - IT WOULD WORK TO GET THE CAR TO WHERE YOU WANTED IT TO GO - BUT THAT YOU WOULD NEED A NEW PART FOR THE IGNITION AND IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WOULD COST QUITE A LOT.  I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR THIS - SO I JUST LEAVE MY KEY IN THE IGNITION AT ALL TIMES - AND USE MY SPARE KEY TO UNLOCK THE CAR.  I FEEL THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL FOR THIS - AS MANY, MANY PEOPLE ONLINE HAVE COMPLAINED - IT SAID FORD FOCUS FROM YEARS 200-2004 (MINE IS A 2004).  A PERSON CAN BECOME STRANDED AS THIS CAN HAPPEN TO SOMEONE ANYWHERE THEY PARK THEIR CAR.  THIS WAS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY - HOWEVER, MY WARRANTY HAS LONG PASSED.  SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS - SINCE EVERYONE IS HAVING PROBLEMS - I BELIEVE IT DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE RECALLED.  THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP ON THIS MATTER.  TRICIA WALTER",
