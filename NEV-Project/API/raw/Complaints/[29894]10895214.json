I TOOK IT TO MY MECHANIC WHO STATED THAT THE SUB-FRAME WAS CRACKED AND FORD HAD A RECALL IN PLACE.  I HAD IT TOWED TO THE NEAREST FORD DEALERSHIP WHO STATED THAT IT WOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE RECALL.  INSTEAD, THEY PUT A CROSS-BAR ON THE CRACKED SUB FRAME BECAUSE THEY DETERMINED IT WAS \"NOT BROKEN\" ONLY \"CRACKED\".  THE SUB FRAME HAD \"RUSTED AND CORRODED\" DUE TO FORD'S OWN ADMITTANCE OF \"FAULTY PARTS\".  I ASKED IF THE VEHICLE WAS SAFE AND THEY STATED \"NO\".  I ASKED IF THE VEHICLE WOULD PASS INSPECTION AND AGAIN THEY STATED \"NO\".  I ASKED IF THIS WAS A \"BANDAID\" THAT THEY PUT ON TO MAKE THEMSELVES FEEL BETTER ABOUT THE FACT THAT ANYONE OPERATING THE VEHICLE COULD LOSE TOTAL CONTROL.  I ASKED TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER, WHO TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO.  HE DID STATE HE WOULD MAKES SOME CALLS AND CALLED ME A DAY OR TWO LATER TO SAY, THAT HIS MANAGER SAID IF I WANTED THE VEHICLE FIXED, I COULD PAY $1,200 FOR THE PART AND AN ADDITIONAL $600-$800 IN LABOR TO FIX THE VEHICLE, OR I COULD TRADE IT IN.  I AM BEYOND FRUSTRATED THAT FORD WILL NOT BACK UP THEIR PRODUCT.  THE VEHICLE HAS LESS THAN 65,000 MILES ON IT!",
