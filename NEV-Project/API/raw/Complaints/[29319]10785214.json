THIS ONE HAS RESULTED IN A VERY SERIOUS CRASH.    2015 TESLA 70D IS FOR SALE AT SALVAGE COMPANY IAAI.  HTTPS://WWW.IAAI.COM/VEHICLES/VEHICLEDETAILS.ASPX?ITEMID=20460578&ROWNUMBER=2&LOADRECENT=TRUE    IT HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN A MAJOR NOSE-TAIL CRASH.  THE BACK WHEEL IS SKEWED OVER IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE OTHER DAMAGED CARS THAT I HAVE REPORTED TO YOU.  THERE IS ZERO DAMAGE IN THAT AREA OF THE CAR AND NO REASON FOR THE WHEEL TO BE SKEWED LIKE THAT.  AN INVESTIGATOR THAT WAS  UNAWARE OF THE STRING OF SIMILAR EVENTS MAY HAVE OVERLOOKED THE SKEWED WHEEL AND ASSUMED IT WAS JUST ANOTHER TAIL-ENDER ACCIDENT.  A POSSIBLE SCENARIO IS THAT THE WHEEL SKEWED SIDEWAY AND  CAUSED A SUDDEN STOP WITHOUT BRAKE LIGHTS COMING ON.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY CASES OF SUSPENSION FAILURE WHICH POINTS TO A DESIGN WEAKNESS.",
