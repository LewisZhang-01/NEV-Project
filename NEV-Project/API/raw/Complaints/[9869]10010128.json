IN THE PAST NINE MONTHS THE SEATBELT FROM THE FIRST SEAT IN THE SECOND ROW HAS GOTTEN STUCK IN THE SLIDING DOOR, CAUSING THE DOOR TO BE JAMMED SHUT. MY CONCERN IS IT COULD BE CLOTHING OR FINGERS OR TOES NEXT TIME. IN ORDER TO GET THE DOOR OPEN IT HAD TO BE TAKEN TO A REPAIR SHOP AND PRIED OUT. THIS SLIDING DOOR IS SUPPOSE TO STOP AND REOPEN WHEN AN OBJECT IS IN ITS PATH. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS MATTER AS I HAVE FIVE SMALL CHILDREN AND I CARPOOL WITH MORE. THANK YOU.    *NLM",
