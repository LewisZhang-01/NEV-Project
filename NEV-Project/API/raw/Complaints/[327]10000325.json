        "summary": "THE TAIL LIGHTS (STOP LIGHTS) ON MY 1995 TOYOTA COROLLA FAIL CONSTANTLY AND INTERMITTENTLY.  WHEN I REPLACE THE BULB(S), THE PROBLEM IS BACK WITHIN WEEKS.  SOMETIMES THEY START WORKING AGAIN BY THEMSELVES.  I HAVE GIVEN UP TRYING TO KEEP ALL FOUR LIGHT BULBS FUNCTIONING.  SOMETIMES WHEN I PRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL, THE LIGHTS ON THE DASHBOARD FLICKER.  MANY OTHER COROLLAS OF THE SAME YEAR HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.  MOST OF THE 95 COROLLAS I SEE ON THE ROAD HAVE AT LEAST ONE NON-FUNCTIONING BULB.  WHEN I SEE A 95 COROLLA ON THE ROAD, I WATCH IT AND WAIT FOR THE BRAKE LIGHTS TO COME ON - ALMOST ALWAYS AT LEAST ONE BULB IS NON-FUNCTIONING.  I HAVE TWO ENGINEERING DEGREES AND I CAN NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  I ASKED THE TOYOTA DEALER TO CHECK FOR RECALLS FOR THIS PROBLEM DURING MY LAST SERVICE, AND THEY IGNORED MY QUESTION.  FROM WHAT I CAN TELL, THE HEAT FROM THE BULB CAUSES A HIGH RESISTANCE BETWEEN THE BULB AND THE SOCKET.  THAT IS WHY I CAN TAKE THE BULB OUT, AND PUT THE SAME BULB BACK IN AND IT STARTS WORKING AGAIN.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN.  ONCE A CAR PULLED ALONG SIDE OF ME AND TOLD ME THAT ALL FOUR BULBS WERE NOT FUNCTIONING, AND THAT ONLY THE REAR WINDOW LIGHT WAS OPERATING.  I AM CONCERNED THAT SOMEDAY EITHER MYSELF OR SOMEONE ELSE IN A 95 COROLLA MAY GET INTO A REAR-END COLLISION.",
