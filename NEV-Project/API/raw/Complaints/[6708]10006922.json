THE CALIPER SLIDES WERE ORIGINALLY REPLACED BY THE DEALERSHIP AND IT SEEMED TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM. APPROX. 1 YEAR LATER THE SAME THING STARTED. THE CALIPER SLIDES WERE THEN GREASED AND THIS SEEMED TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM UNTIL APPROX. 1 MORE YEAR LATER. THE CALIPER SLIDES WERE STICKING AGAIN, MAKING CLUNKING NOISES WHEN YOU BRAKE.  I WAS TOLD THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT REQUIRE REGULAR MAINTENANCE. I WANT TO KNOW WHY THIS IS STILL HAPPENING TO THE CALIPER SLIDES AND WHY THERE IS NOT A RECALL ON THIS IF THE PROBLEM CANNOT BE CORRECTED. *PH  *JB    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**749080",
