PROBABLY A $1.00 PART.  BUT THE LOCAL DEALER SAYS THAT THEY CANNOT PROVIDE THE CLIP OR THE BELT.  AM I SUPPOSED TO THROW AWAY A CAR THAT IS OTHERWISE PERFECT??    IS NOT THE MANUFACURER REQUIRED TO PROVIDE AVAILABILITY OF REPLACEMENT SAFETY PARTS?  THERE ARE MILLIONS OF THESE GM CARS STILL ON THE ROAD.",
