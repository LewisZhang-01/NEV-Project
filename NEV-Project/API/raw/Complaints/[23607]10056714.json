WAS ADVISED THAT IF I DID NOT HAVE REPAIR MADE AT FORD DEALERSHIP THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY FOR THEIR ENGINEERS TO DOCUMENT AND INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM.  ALSO AWARE THE ESCAMBIA COUNTY, FL SHERIFF'S DEPT. HAS TO REPLACE THIS SAME PART ON A REGULAR BASIS.  AFTER REVIEWING THE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS I FIND THAT A RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR POLICE AND TAXI VEHICLES BUT NOT PASSENGER VEHICLES.  THE COST OF THIS PART WITH A DISCOUNT WAS $501. THE REPLACEMENT MANIFOLD HAS A METAL WATER PASSAGE TO PREVENT FURTHER CRACKS.  FORD MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS AND FORCED TO REPAIR, REPLACE OR REFUND THIS DEFECTIVE MAJOR ENGINE PART.*AK",
