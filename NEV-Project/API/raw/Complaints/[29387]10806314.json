        "summary": "THIS PROBLEM BEGAN OCCURRING AT AROUND 60,000 MILES.  WHEN EITHER STATIONARY OR IN MOTION, THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WOULD EITHER NOT COME ON AT ALL OR WOULD JERKILY (IS THAT A WORD?) MAKE THEIR WAY ABOUT HALFWAY UP THE WINDSHIELD AND THEN FREEZE. THEN AT SOME RANDOM TIME, THEY WOULD EITHER JERK THEIR WAY BACK TO THE PARKED POSITION OR CONTINUE JERKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THE WHOLE SWEEP AND THEN BACK TO THE PARKED POSITION, USUALLY STOPPING ONCE OR MORE TIMES ON THE WAY.    THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE ACCORDING TO POSTS FOUND ON THE GENESISOWNERS.COM SITE.  (HTTP://WWW.GENESISOWNERS.COM/HYUNDAI-GENESIS-FORUM/SHOWTHREAD.PHP?T=8567 ). IF YOU READ THE POSTS, ONE MAN ALMOST HAD A HEAD ON COLLISION WITH A GASOLINE TRUCK WHEN HIS WIPERS DECIDED TO QUIT IN THE MIDDLE OF A RAINSTORM.    MY LOCAL DEALER INSISTS HYUNDAI DOES NOT CONSIDER THIS A SAFETY ISSUE WHICH TO ME IS MINDBOGGLING. WITH A POTENTIALLY RECORD BREAKING EL NINO NOW ON THE WAY, PERHAPS IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOMEONE GETTING KILLED BEFORE HYUNDAI FINALLY SAYS, \"GEE, WE GUESS IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE AFTER ALL.\"    IF THIS DEFECT IS NEWS TO DOT, I CAN SEE NO REASON NOT TO INSIST ON A RECALL.  IF, HOWEVER, DOT IS AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND HAS DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT, SHAME ON THEM.    SINCE HYUNDAI EXPECTED ME TO PAY $1,000 TO MOST LIKELY REINSTALL THE SAME FAULTY MOTOR AND LINKAGE, I GOT RID OF THE CAR. THE MOTOR COSTS $462 BY ITSELF.",
