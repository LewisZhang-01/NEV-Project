THE MOST RECENT, DRIVING DOWN THE EXPRESSWAY 60 MPH THE CAR SHUT OFF.  PUT IN NEUTRAL AND STARTED THE CAR BACK UP.  WHEN CAR STARTED BACK UP THERE WAS A LOUD TICKING NOISE IN THE FRONT.  THEN THE CAR SHUT OFF 3 MORE TIME AND ON THE FOURTH STALL WOULD NOT START BACK UP.  WHEN TOWED TO REPAIR SHOP HE INDICATED THE ENGINE WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED (OIL JUST CHANGED AND FULL).  WHEN CALLING AROND FOR NEW ENGINE ALL DEALERS INDICATED THOUGHS ENGINES ARE VERY HARD TO FIND BECAUSE EVERYONE IS LOOKING FOR THEM BECAUSE A BLOWN ENGINE IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH INTREPIDS.  I HOPE THERE ARE MORE COMPLAINTS REPORTED SO THIS PROBLEM IS RESOLVED.  I KNOW OF 3 INTREPID IN MY AREA THAT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.",
