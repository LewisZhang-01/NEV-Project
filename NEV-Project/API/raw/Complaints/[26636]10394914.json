THE LOCAL GM DEALER, ON THE INCIDENT DATE IN THIS FORM, TOLD ME THE CAUSE WAS OIL DRIPPING ON THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD AND THAT IT WAS A FIRE HAZARD.  UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, I FOUND AN EXISTING NHTSA ACTION NUMBER (EA07008) FOR THE EXACT PROBLEM I AM HAVING FOR THE EXACT 3800 SERIES II V6 L67 GM ENGINE.  THERE WERE 2 RECALLS FOR CARS WITH THIS ENGINE, BUT MY PONTIAC MODEL WAS NOT INCLUDED (EVEN THOUGH IT HAS THE EXACT SAME ENGINE).  THE NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECALLS ARE 08V118000 & 09V116000.  I ESCALATED THIS PROBLEM WITHIN GM AND THEY TOLD ME TO TAKE THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE GM DEALER FOR ANOTHER INSPECTION.  THE GM DEALER VERIFIED THAT MY ENGINE IS THE SAME AS THE RECALLED ENGINE AND THAT I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.  GM REFUSED TO FIX THE PROBLEM BECAUSE MY VEHICLE'S VIN WASN'T SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED IN THE RECALLS.  I STRONGLY BELIEVE MY VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE EARLIER RECALLS AND NOW SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR A NEW RECALL TO ELIMINATE THIS SAFETY HAZARD.",
