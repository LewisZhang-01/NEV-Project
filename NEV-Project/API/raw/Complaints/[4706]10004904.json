THE BODY AND ALL OTHER PARTS ARE IN GREAT SHAPE.  I SERVICE THIS CAR RELIGIOUSLY.  I SEE ON YOUR SITE A FAIR AMOUNT OF OTHERS WHO HAVE THE SAME COMPLAINT.  I LOVE THE CAR SO MUCH, I ALMOST WANTED TO PAY FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION AND KEEP DRIVING IT UNTIL I READ ON YOUR SITE THAT NISSAN IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING ABOUT A RECALL.  WILL MOST LIKELY PURCHASE ANOTHER VEHICLE.  THANKS",
