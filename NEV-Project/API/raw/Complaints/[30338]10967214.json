I DON'T OVER FILL, I JUST STOP FILLING WHEN THE PUMP CLICKS OFF. I HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL SO AS NOT TO GET INTO AN ACCIDENT. IF THIS HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY WHERE I LIVE, I COULD BE KILLED. I READ ABOUT THE PROBLEM ON A JEEP FORUM AND FOUND ABOUT THIS WEBSITE SO I THOUGHT I WOULD FILE A COMPLAINT DUE TO THE DANGEROUS CONDITION.",
