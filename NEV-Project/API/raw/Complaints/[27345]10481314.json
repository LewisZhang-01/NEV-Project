THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS WHEN DRIVING ON AN INTERSTATE AT SPEEDS OF 65MPH AND THEN THE WARNING LIGHTS COME ON AND MY CAR  JUST SLOWS DOWN TO ABOUT 20 MPH IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC.   THE TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND HAVE A RECALL ON THEIR 2005 TOYOTA SEQUOIA VEHICLES.   THEY DID DO A RECALL ON THE TOYOTA SEQUOIAS FOR THE 2008 - 2010 MODELS WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM. I HAVE READ THAT MANY OTHER OWNERS OF 2005 TOYOTA SEQUOIAS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.   I HAD TO HAVE MY CAR TOWED TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THAT IT WOULD COST AROUND 3,200 TO FIX.     I FEEL THAT THE TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION NEEDS TO DO A RECALL AND FIX THIS FAULTY SYSTEM ON THEIR TOYOTA SEQUOIAS.     TOTALLY FRUSTRATED AND PLAN ON TELLING EVERYONE I SEE DRIVING A SEQUOIA ABOUT THE PROBLEM I HAVE HAD AND TELL THEM THEY NEED TO CONSIDER GETTING RID OF THEIR VEHICLE.   *TR",
