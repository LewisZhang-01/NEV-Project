SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS WITH ENGAGING 2ND GEAR, THE TRANSMISSION SLIPS AND MAKES A RATTLING NOISE, ALSO WHEN I AM DRIVING, THE TIRES GET CAUGHT IN A GROOVE ON THE FREEWAY, THE FRONT WHEELS WILL FOLLOW THE GROOVE WHILE I AM HOLDING THE STEERING WHEEL STRAIGHT. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE RACK AND PINION, OR A DEFECT IN THE STEERING ASSEMBLY/LINKAGE. I HAVE BROUGHT THE CAR IN TO 3 LOCAL DEALERSHIPS HERE IN LAS VEGAS AND ALL OF THEM CLAIM THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR, AFTER LOOKING AT IT, I NOTICED ON YOUR WEBSITE -THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSMISSIONS/SUSPENSIONS OF THESE SPECIFIC CARS. PLEASE NOTE THAT THE CAR IS STILL UNDER THE MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY. IS THERE SOMETHING YOU COULD DO TO HELP US GET THIS PROBLEM CORRECTED?  *JB",
