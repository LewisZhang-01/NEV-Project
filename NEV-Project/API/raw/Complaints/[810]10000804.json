        "summary": "THEIR ARE TO MANY PROBLEMS AND TRIPS TO THE DEALERSHIP TO LIST!!! I EXPERIENCED FOUR RECALLS AT ONCE ON JULY 25TH, 2002. THE TECHNICIANS ARE OBVIOUSLY INCOMPENTENT OR HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO FIX THIS VEHICLE CORRECTLY IN THE FIRST PLACE. I CALLED THE GM CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER GIVEN RUN AROUND. I SUFFERED A CATROSTROFIC ENGINE FAILURE AS A RESULT OF LOW COOLANT IN MY ENGINE WHEN FAILURES OCCURRED. LETTERS FROM GM STATE VEHICLES CAN SUFFER ENGINE DAMAGED OR ENGINE FAILURE AND THAT THEY WILL COVER THE LOSSES AND AT NO COST TO ME.  I HAVE TO PAY FOR THE COST, TOTAL $1,700.71  FOR THE ENGINE COOLER TO BE REPLACED!! GM REFUSES TO COVER THE ENGINE COOLER DAMAGE!!  CAR STILL IS NOT RUNNING RIGHT AND ENGINE SOUNDS HORRIBLE. THE SERVICE MANAGER GETS ON THE PHONE AND STARTS YELLING AT ME BECAUSE I HAVE A FILED A LOCAL LAWSUIT AGAINST THE DEALERSHIP AND GM. HE TOLD ME HE REFUSES TO HONOR MY WARRANTYS BOTH FROM THE RECALL WORK PERFORMED AND THE REPAIRS I HAD TO PAY FOR 12 MONTH/12,000 MILES WARRANTY. I HAVE NO COOPERATION FROM THE DEALERSHIP OR GM AND I'M STUCK WITH A LEMON NO ONE WANTS BECAUSE THE VALUE IS SO LOW COMPARED TO WHAT I PAID FOR THE CAR AND THE KNOWN PROBLEMS (LEMON) FOR THIS MAKE AND MODEL.  THE BBB REFUSES TO HELP. THIS AGENCY IS EVERYONE'S LAST HOPE THAT OWNS A CATERA BECAUSE GM TREATS US LIKE DIRT AND REFUSES TO COVER THE ENGINE DAMAGES  AND RELATED DAMAGES THAT OCCUR WHEN THESE FAILURES THAT THEY ACKNOWLEDGE FINALLY. PLEASE HELP US AS CONSUMERS AND INFORCE A MANDATORY RECALL ON THIS ENTIRE VEHICLE. WE ARE ALL PAYING FOR CARS THAT HAVE LITTLE TO NO VALUE WITH LOANS THAT WE ARE UNABLE TO GET OUT OF BECAUSE THE TRADE IN VALUE IS SO POOR. IT'S NOT RIGHT AND IS ABSOLOUTELY UN AMERICAN!!!!! I WISH SOME ATTORNEYS WOULD FILE A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST GM TO MAKE THEM DO JUST THAT OR HELP US GET OUT OF THESE LEMONS.  PLEASE HELP US.",
