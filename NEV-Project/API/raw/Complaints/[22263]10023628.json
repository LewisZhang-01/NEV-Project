WHEN SHE TIGHTENED THE HARNESS, THE HARNESS RETRACTOR SYSTEM BROKE COMPLETELY OFF OF THE SEAT.  SHE WAS NOT USING EXCESSIVE FORCE.  A PLASTIC SCREW IS ALL THAT WAS HOLDING THIS ELEMENT ONTO THE SHELL OF THE SEAT.  THE SCREW WAS STRIPPED AND THE ENTIRE ELEMENT CAME OFF IN HER HANDS, RENDERING THE SEAT USELESS.  SHE REPLACED MY SEAT WITH A CONVERTIBLE SEAT ON-SITE SO I COULD SAFELY TRANSPORT MY DAUGHTER HOME.  HAD THIS OCCURRED IN A CRASH, MY DAUGHTER WOULD HAVE VERY LIKELY BEEN EJECTED FROM HER SEAT AND SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED.  THE SENIOR TECHNICIAN ON DUTY AT THE SITE CHECKED MY SEAT AND AGREED THAT THIS FAILURE WAS DUE TO A PROBLEM WITH THE SEAT, NOT EXCESSIVE FORCE.  THEY ENCOURAGED ME TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH NHTSA.  I WILL ALSO FOLLOW UP WITH EVENFLO AS A RESULT OF THIS FAILURE.  *JB",
