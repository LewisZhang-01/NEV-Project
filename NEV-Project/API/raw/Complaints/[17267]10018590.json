        "summary": "I HAVE A 2003 2500 DODGE RAM DIESEL WITH 15,000 MILES ON IT.   I HAVE JUST BEGUN EXPERIENCING TRANSMISSION TROUBLES.  AS I'M DRIVING 80 MPH DOWN THE FREEWAY THE TRUCK WILL ALL OF A SUDDEN (ON ITS OWN) SLIP DOWN INTO 2ND GEAR (NOT 3RD, BUT 2ND) WHILE GOING 80.  THE ENGINE IS RED-LINING AND ABOUT TO BLOW.  I CHECK THE DASH AND THE COLUMN AND ALL SAY IT IS STILL IN D(RIVE) WHEN IN FACT IT'S IN 2ND.  IT HAS ALSO HAPPENED THAT WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY THE TRUCK JUST SHIFTS INTO NEUTRAL ALL BY ITSELF AND THE DASH AND COLUMN SAY IT IS STILL IN D(RIVE); REVS ARE HIGH BUT NO ENGAGEMENT (WHILE IN THE FAST LANE AND QUICKLY DROPPING TO ZERO IN SPEED.)  THE ONLY OTHER WEIRD THING THAT'S HAPPENED IS WHILE MERGING ONTO THE FREEWAY AND TRYING TO PICK UP SPEED THE TRUCK WOULD NOT SHIFT TO THE NEXT GEAR AND STARTED TO RED-LINE.  I QUICKLY LOOK DOWN TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAD NOT SOMEHOW ACCIDENTALLY PUT IT IN 2ND GEAR.  NOPE, IT WAS IN D(RIVE), JUST NOT MOVING ON TO THE NEXT GEAR AND WELL INTO 3,800 REVS STUCK IN WHATEVER GEAR IT WAS.     THE DEALER IS DEALING WITH IT NOW, BUT ARE SWEARING UP, DOWN AND BACKWARDS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS TRANSMISSION AS IT IS THE BEST ON THE MARKET AND THE MOST RELIABLE.  I HAD EVEN INQUIRED INTO THE INFAMOUS DODGE TRANSMISSION TROUBLES BEFORE BUYING THE TRUCK AND THEY SAID THAT THEY HAD ADDRESSED AND FIXED THE PROBLEM.  BUT NOW SEEING THAT THEY CAN'T REPRODUCE THE EXACT ISSUE WHILE THE TRUCK IS IN THE SHOP (IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN, JUST ABOUT ONCE EVERY 3-4 WEEKS WITH DAILY DRIVING) THEY CAN'T ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.  WHAT THE . . .???   *NLM",
