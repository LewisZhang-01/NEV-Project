THIS FAULT MAY LEAD TO FIRES AND WE WERE TOLD TO CONTACT ANY FACILITY IMMEDIATELY TO SCHEDULE A REPAIR THAT WOULD TAKE LESS THAN 30 MINUTES.    AT LEAST 5 TIMES ACROSS MULTIPLE DAYS AND THROUGH MULTIPLE TECHNOLOGIES, WE CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AT 4960 NORTH, FL-7, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 (COCOUNUT CREEK HYUNDAI) WHERE WE ORIGINALLY PURCHASED THE CAR. THEY REFUSED TO RESPOND TO US AND SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT. NEVERTHELESS, WE STILL VISITED PHYSICALLY IN PERSON ON 3/16. AFTER KEEPING OUR CAR FOR NEARLY 8 HOURS THEY CLAIMED NO TECHNICIAN WAS AVAILABLE TO REPAIR OUR CAR THAT DAY! THEY NEVER AGREED TO SCHEDULE THE LEGALLY REQUIRED REPAIRS AS WE REQUESTED MANY TIMES IN ADVANCE AND EVEN HELD OUR CAR HOSTAGE AND REFUSED TO REPAIR IT! THEY HAVE VIOLATED THE LAW AND PUT OUR LIVES AT RISK. THEY MUST BE PUNISHED AND WE MUST BE COMPENSATED FOR THIS BARBARIC TREATMENT AT THE HANDS OF HYUNDAI. OUR CAR IS STILL AT RISK OF EXPLOSION AND HYUNDAI REFUSES TO FIX IT.",
