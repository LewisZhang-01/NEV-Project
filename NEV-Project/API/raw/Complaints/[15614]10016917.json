I TOOK THE SUV TO A VERY WELL RESPECTED WINDSHIELD REPAIR SHOP AND AFTER THEIR EXAM GAVE ME 2  POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THIS FAILURE. #1 REASON INSUFFICIENT STRENGTH OF THE GLASS. IT IS VERY THIN FOR A WINDSHIELD (FORD WINDSHIELD RECALL) UNABLE TO HANDLE THE STRESS OF NORMAL AND EXPECTED ROAD SURFACE CONDITIONS. #2 IMPROPER INSTALLATION . THIS WINDSHIELD WAS NOT STRUCK WITH ANY OBJECT.   *NLM",
