JUST THIS MORNING, I WAS TRYING DESPERATELY TO TRY TO MAKE THE STRAPS TIGHTER, AND MY HAND GAVE WAY AND I SLUGGED MY DAUGHTER IN THE CHEEK VERY HARD.  THE STRAPS TWIST IN 3 SPOTS:  IN THE SHOULDER PAD, IN THE MIDDLE CLIP, AND AGAIN, IN THE PUZZLE LOCK SYSTEM THAT LOCKS INTO THE SEAT.  I'VE CONTACTED COSCO, AND ALL THEY WILL DO IS REPLACE THE STRAPS.  ONLY TO HAPPEN AGAIN, I'M SURE.  IT'S FUNNY THEY REPLACE THE STRAPS, WHEN IT'S THE STRAPS THAT ARE THE PROBLEM!  I WANT THEM TO TAKE THIS CAR SEAT BACK AND GIVE ME A REFUND!!",
