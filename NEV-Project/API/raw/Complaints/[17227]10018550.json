LEFT FRONT ATTACHMENT RAIL NUT  WORKED IT'S WAY THROUGH THE RAILING CAUSING FRONT LEFT PART OF SEAT TO DISLODGE ITSELF FROM SEAT TRACK,  WHICH ALLOWED SEAT TO FALL BACK AND TO THE RIGHT.  NUTS WHICH ATTACH SEAT TO TRACK ARE SMALLER THAN BOLT HOLES CAUSING NUTS TO WORK THROUGH BOLT HOLES RESULTING IN SEAT TRACK AND SEAT BASE FAILURE. I EXPLAINED TO DEALER THAT THIS WAS NOT NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR.  DEALER DID NOT REIMBURSE ME FOR THE COST OF A NEW BASE, WHICH COST $350.00.  THE NEW BASE INCLUDED LARGER ATTACHMENT NUTS WITH A NOTE STATING DO NOT USE OLD ATTACHMENT NUTS.  THE NOTE AND LARGER ATTACHMENT NUTS REINFORCES THE FACT THAT THE MANUFACTURER KNEW THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THESE ATTACHMENT BOLTS, BUT REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT OR REIMBURSE CONSUMERS FOR THEIR EXPENSES RELATED TO THIS PROBLEM.    *NLM",
