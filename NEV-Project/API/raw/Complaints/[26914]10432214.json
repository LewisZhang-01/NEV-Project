SECOND, ON ANOTHER OCCASION, I WAS SITTING AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT AND WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO PULL OFF, THE VEHICLE STARTED DRIVING VERY SLOW AND ROUGH. I PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD; TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND WAITED FOR A FEW SECONDS. WHEN I STARTED THE VEHICLE AGAIN AND ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE AWAY, THE VEHICLE DROVE PROPERLY.  MERCEDES DEALERSHIP IS AWARE OF THESE ISSUES, AND ALSO MANY OF PEOPLE I KNOW WHO HAVE MERCEDES WITH SAME TRANSMISSION TYPE - VALVE BODY/ELECTRIC PLATE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED IN AUTO TRANSMISSION.  *TR",
