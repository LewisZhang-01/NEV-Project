THE KEY INSIDE THE REMOTE IS NOT CORRECT FOR THE VEHICLE IN QUESTION, AS CONFIRMED BY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER. THE DEFECT SUBSTANTIALLY IMPAIRS THE NORMAL OPERATION OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE, CREATES A SUBSTANTIAL RISK, AND PLACES OUR HEALTH AND WELFARE IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY. PROVIDED THE DEALERSHIP WITH REASONABLE OPPORTUNITIES TO REPAIR THE DEFECT(S). HOWEVER, THIS GOOD FAITH EFFORT WAS TO NO AVAIL.  DEALER HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF FAILURE, BUT REFUSES TO CORRECT. I REASONABLY BELIEVE OUR SAFETY IS COMPROMISED WITHOUT APPROPRIATE CORRECTION. DEALERSHIP FAILED TO MEET MY REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS UNDER THE LAW.",
