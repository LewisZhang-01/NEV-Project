AT TIMES THIS LEAD TO DANGEROUS SITUATIONS. DEALER SAID THERE WAS NO PROBLEM. THE ACCELERATOR MODULE WAS REPLACED ( NOT AT DEALER) AND THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS FOR A TIME, NOW THE SAME LAG HAS BEGUN TO OCCUR AT RANDOM TIMES, ESPECIALLY AFTER SLOWING TO LESS THAN 20 MILES PER HOUR.    NOTE:-- THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR ONE OF TWO DRIVERS OF THE CAR.  APPARENTLY THE POSITION OF THE DRIVER'S FOOT ON THE ACCELERATOR MAKES THE DIFFERENCE.      NEVER HAS THIS DRIVER HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM IN MORE THAN 50 YEARS OF DRIVING ALL TYPES OF VEHICLES  ( THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM, NOT A SINGLE OR ISOLATED EVENT.)",
