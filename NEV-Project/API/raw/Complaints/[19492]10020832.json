THE DEALERSHIP COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.  PLEASE NOTE THIS MOTORHOME WAS IN FOR REPAIR AT A FREIGHTLINER FACILITY ON OR ABOUT 9/12/02 WHERE BOLTS WERE CUT OFF THE FRAME.  THIS MOTORHOME HAS ALSO HAD A CONSTANT NOISE ON THE CHASSIS BECAUSE OF THE SHIFTING FIREWALL AND CHASSIS FLOOR.  DAMON THE MANUFACTURER FINALLY REPAIRED IT BY WELDING THE FIREWALL AND FLOOR TUBING TOGETHER.   THERE WAS ALSO A PROBLEM WITH A BREAK IN A CHARGING WIRE.  TO REPAIR THEY INSTALLED AN OVERLAY WIRE.  TO THIS DATE THEY ARE STILL UNABLE TO FIND WHERE THE BREAK IS.  WE FEAR THERE MAY BE A SCREW THROUGH THE WIRING HARNESS THAT MAY CAUSE ADDITIONAL ON ROAD PROBLEMS.  THIS MOTORHOME HAS BEEN AT THE DEALERSHIP SINCE 11/2/02.     *TT",
