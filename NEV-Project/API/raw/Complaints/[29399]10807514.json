WE  HAVE  HAD  SAFETY  ISSUES  WITH  THIS  TRUCK  EVER  SINCE  PURCHASING  IT  AS  A  USED  VEHICLE  FROM  RAMEY'S  IN  BECKLEY,  WV.       THERE  ARE  AT  PRESENT  THREE  (3)  RECALLS  ON  THIS  VEHICLE,  OF  WHICH  N49  APPEARS  TO  BE  THE  MOST  LIFE-THREATENING,  WHICH  WE  WERE  NEVER  NOTIFIED  ABOUT,  NOR  WERE  WE  EVER  NOTIFIED  ABOUT  THE  BUYBACK  ON  THIS  TRUCK.  WE  ACCIDENTALLY  FOUND  OUT.  WE  WERE  NEVER  NOTIFIED  OF  ANYTHING  CONCERNING  THESE  PROBLEMS,  PROBABLY  BECAUSE  WE  PURCHASED  IT  USED.       THE  PROBLEM  WITH  THE  TIE  ROD,  WHICH  COULD  CAUSE  LOSS  OF  CONTROL  AND  A  POSSIBLE  CRASH  IS  NOT  THE  ONLY  LIFE-THREATENING  RECALL.   THE  RECALL  WITH  THE  FUEL  HEATER  COULD  POSSIBLY  CAUSE  A  FIRE.  WE  HAVE,  ON  SEVERAL  OCCASIONS,  NOTICED  SMOKE  COMING  OUT  FROM  UNDER  THE  HOOD  WHILE  REFUELING  THE  TRUCK,  AS  WELL  AS  A  NOTICEABLE  SHAKING  AND  VIBRATING  IN  THE  FRONT  OF  THE  TRUCK WHILE  IN  OPERATION.       FCA  US,  LLC  IS  ATTEMPTING  TO  CIRCUMVENT  THE  \"CONSENT  ORDER\"  AGREED  TO BY  THEM  WITH  NHTSA.  THEY  HAVE  AGREED  TO  REPURCHASE  THESE  DEFECTIVE  VEHICLES  FOR  THE  PURCHASE  PRICE  PAID  BY  THE  \"ORIGINAL\"  PURCHASER,  MINUS  A  REASONABLE  AMOUNT  FOR  DEPRECIATION,  PLUS  10%!  IT  APPEARS  THAT  FCA  IS  MAKING  THEIR  OWN  RULES  TO  REPURCHASE  BY  \"LOW-BALLING\"  THE  REPURCHASE  PRICE!  WHAT  THEY  ARE  ATTEMPTING  TO  DO  IS  CALLED  FRAUD!  IT  WOULD  APPEAR  THAT  NHTSA  IS  ALLOWING  IT!  SHOULD  A   CRASH  OR  FIRE  HAPPEN  WHILE  FCA  DRAGS  ITS  FEET  ON  THE  REPURCHASE  OF  THIS  TRUCK,  SOMEONE  WILL  BE  HELD  ACCOUNTABLE  BY  LAW!",
