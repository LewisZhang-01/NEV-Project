THE FUEL SENDING UNIT WILL GO OUT SEND AN EML CODE AND THE FUEL GAUGE WILL DROP DOWN TO EMPTY EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A FULL TANK. DODGE WANTS TO CHARGE ME $1000 TO REPLACE THIS, SINCE I AM  OUTSIDE OF THE OEM WARRANTY. THIS HAS HAPPENED ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS TO ME.  IT HAPPENED TO MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER WHILE THEY WERE DRIVING MY TRUCK AND HAD TO STOP AND TOP OFF THE GAS TANK OTHERWISE THE TRUCK COULD HAVE SHUT DOWN. IT HAD 3/4 TANK OF GAS IN IT. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD BECOME A RECALL.",
