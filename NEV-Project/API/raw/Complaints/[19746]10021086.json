REPAIR SHOP CALLED CHRYSLER COMPANY AND THEY SAID TO REPLACE IT. OUR EXTENDED WARRANTY COMPANY WANTS ME TO AUTHORIZE REPAIRS AND WILL DECIDE WHAT PERCENTAGE THEY WILL PAY FOR IT. BUT THE POLICY WE HAVE STATES ENGINE REPAIRS AND REPLACEMENT., ACCORDING TO THEIR BOOKLET. THE COST TO REPLACE IT, $8,300.00!  THAT IS MORE THAN WHAT WE PAID FOR THE CAR.
