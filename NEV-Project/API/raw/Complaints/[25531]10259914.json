AND PULLS THE VEHICLE TO THE LEFT. THIS HAPPENS BETWEEN 40-55 MPH  I ALMOST CRASHED ON THE ON RAMP OF THE 405 FREEWAY BECAUSE THE BIKE WOULD SIMPLY NOT TURN TO THE RIGHT AND I HAD TO FIGHT WITH IT TO GET IT TO TURN. I STOPPED 2.5 FEET BEFORE CRASHING IN TO THE WALL. I KNOW OF 3 PEOPLE THAT HAVE ALREADY CRASHED AND BRP (THE MANUFACTURER WILL NOT REPLY TO US)  THERE WAS A LADY THAT LOST HER LIFE DUE TO A LOW SPEED CRASH, BUT WE HAVE NO WAY OF ASKING HER WHAT HAPPENED AND NOW EVERYONE IS WORRIED IT IS BECAUSE OF THIS. HERE IS A LINK TO A FEW POSTS ABOUT PEOPLE EXPERIENCING THIS HTTP://WWW.SPYDERTALK.COM/FORUMS/INDEX.PHP?SHOWTOPIC=9212 AND ONE PERSON WHO HAD TO BE HOSPITALIZED DUE TO THIS. *TR",
