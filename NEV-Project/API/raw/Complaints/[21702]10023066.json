        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE PA TURNPIKE GOING 60 MPH IN MY 2002 FORD FOCUS. I HAD JUST PASSED A COP AND HAVE WITNESSES THAT I WAS NOT SPEEDING OR DRIVING ERRATICALLY. IT WAS 8:30 IN THE MORNING AND MY CAR SUDDENLY LOST ALL POWER. MY RPM'S DROPPED AND I WAS LOOSING MY SPEED. (THIS HAPPENED ONE MONTH PRIOR AND I TOOK IT TO FORD. THEY REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP AND TWO OTHER PARTS ON WARRANTY) I HAD TO GET TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER, WHICH HAD A WALL RIGHT AFTER IT, BECAUSE I WAS IN THE LEFT LANE WHERE THERE WAS A WALL DIRECTLY TO MY LEFT. IN TRYING TO CROSS THE CAR LOST TRACTION ON THE ROAD AND SHOT ME HEAD FIRST INTO THE WALL. HEAD FIRST AT 55 MPH AND MY AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. THE CAR HAS BEEN DEEMED A TOTAL LOSS AND FOR THE PAST TEN DAYS I HAVE BEEN IN UNBELIEVABLE PAIN, TO THE ER 3 TIMES. NOW I HAVE PHYSICAL THERAPY FOR ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING IS BETTER. I AM A 19 YEAR OLD FEMALE AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYBODY ELSE HURT IN THIS SORT OF ACCIDENT. I HAVE AN ATTORNEY AND I SUGGEST ANYONE WITH A FOCUS HAVE ONE ON HAND. I WANT EVERYONE TO READ THIS BEFORE THEY BUY ONE! MY NEXT STEP IS TO CONTACT MAGAZINES AND TELEVISION SHOWS. I HAD A GUARDIAN ANGEL WITH ME, SOMEONE MAY NOT BE SO LUCKY!    *NLM",
