I RETURNED THE TRAILER AND GOT ANOTHER.  THE SECOND TRAILER HAD A BEARING GO OUT ON THE FREEWAY IN PIXLEY, CA.  MY CALL TO THE UHAUL 1-800 NUMBER WAS MET WITH DISDAIN.  THE CSR'S HAD NO IDEA HOW TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.  I WAS TOLD TO DRIVE THE TRAILER OVER 30 MILES TO THE NEAREST HOTEL TO AWAIT A REPAIR PERSON THE NEXT DAY.  I'M SURPRISED THE TRAILER DID NOT CATCH ON FIRE.  UHAUL RESPONDED TO MY COMPLAINT BY FAILING TO RESPOND.  I EMAILED THEIR WEB SITE.  THE REFERRED ME TO THE LOCAL HALTOM CITY MANAGER AND HE NEVER RETURNED MY CALL.  I DO NOT BELIEVE UHAUL RENTALS ARE SAFE ON THE HIGHWAY.  I ALSO DO NOT BELIEVE THEY ARE ENFORCING ANY TYPE OF SAFETY PROGRAM FOR THE THOUSANDS OF RENTAL VEHICLES THEY PLACE ON OUR HIGHWAYS.     *NLM",
