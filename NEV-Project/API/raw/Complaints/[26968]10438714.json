THE FRAME IS UNSAFE AND A FAILURE COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH. THE MOST SEVERE LOCATION OF THE ROT IN JUST IN FRONT OF THE REAR LEAF SPRINGS ON THE INSIDE OF THE FRAME. TOOK IT FOR INSPECTION AND IT FAILED AS IT WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE.  NOW HAVE TO TAKE IT TO A WELDER TO SEE IF IT CAN EVEN BE REPAIRED.  THINKING OF FILING A CLAIM WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NY STATE.  THE THING IS IT PASSED INSPECTION AT THE SMALL CAR BUSINESS I BOUGHT IT FROM( D AND D AUTOSALES IN BINGHAMTON NY-DON'T GO THERE!!!!!!) AND THERE IS NO WAY IT ROTTED LIKE THIS IN LESS THAN A YR SO I'M THINKING THEY PASSED IT JUST TO GET THE SALE. HAVEN'T CONTACTED TOYOTA BUT THEY MOST LIKELY WONT DO A THING FOR ME.  *TR",
