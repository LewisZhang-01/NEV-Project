I HAVE HAD THREE MASS AIR SENSORS REPLACED, TWO OF WHICH WERE COVERED UNDER MY EXTENDED WARRENTY AT APPROXIMATELY 37,000 MILES, THIS LAST ONE WAS NOT.  VW REFUSED TO ASSIST WITH THE REPAIR.  ALSO, A DEALER PREVIOUSLY TOLD ME  BACK IN AUGUST 2002 THAT I NEEDED $700.00 WORTH OF GLOW PLUG SENSORS AND GLOW PLUGS.  I HAD THEM REPLACE THE SENSOR FOR $400.00.  THEY DID NOT HAVE THE GLOW PLUGS IN STOCK.  INCIDENTLY MY CAR STARTED EVERY TIME THIS WINTER IN THE FREEZING COLD. IT TURNS OUT THAT THEY WERE NOT BAD AFTER ALL AND THAT I NEEDED A GLOW PLUG HARNESS FOR $118.00., WHICH I FOUND OUT LAST WEEK WHEN IT BROKE DOWN ON ME AGAIN.   IF I HAD REPLACED THE PLUGS I WOULD HAVE WASTED ANOTHER $300.00. LAST WEEK MY CAR DISPLAYED THE SAME SYMPTOMS AS IT DID WHEN MY MASS AIR SENSOR FAILED THE FIRST TWO TIMES.  I TOOK IT TO THE FIRST DEALER THAT I COULD GET IN TO AND THEY TOLD ME NEEDED TO CLEAN MY INTAKE MAINFOLD, REPLACE THE FUEL FILTER, AIR FILTER, GLOW PLUG HARNESS AND MASS AIR SENSOR FOR $1200.00.  I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TO VW HAS TO REPLACE GREATER THAN 50% OF THEIR MASS AIR SENSORS.  WHY ARE THEY NOT RECALLED.  I DRIVE 100 MILES TO WORK EACH WAY AND THIS CAR HAS BEEN AN EXPENSIVE LET DOWN.   I HAVE NO FAITH IN THE VW COMPANY AND ONCE THEY GET YOUR MONEY THEY DO NOT SEEM TO CARE AT ALL.  THE CAR IS UNSAFE.  I WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE THEM UNTIL I GET SOME RESOLUTION.",
