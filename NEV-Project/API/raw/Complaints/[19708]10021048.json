ONCE THE CAR IS INCLINED FORWARD OR FLAT, THE LIGHT TURNS OFF WITHIN A FEW SECONDS AND WITHIN 1-3 MINUTES THE GAGE MOVES BACK UP.  THE GAGE IS ALSO SLOW TO RESPOND TO FILLING, AND IN GENERAL NOT EXTREMELY ACCURATE.  I CALLED THE LOCAL DEALER/SERVICE PEOPLE, SAID THE GAGE IS ACTING ODD, HOW MUCH WORK IS INVOLVED WITH TROUBLESHOOTING THE EXACT PROBLEM.  THEY SAID, WE KNOW WHAT IT IS, IT IS THE SENDING UNIT THAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. (REQUIRING FUEL TANK & PUMP REMOVAL, ETC...) IF THIS PROBLEM IS SO PREVALENT THAT THE SERVICE DESK PERSONNEL KNOW IMMEDIATELY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AN EXTREMELY COMMON FAILURE AND A DEFECTIVE PART.   *NLM",
