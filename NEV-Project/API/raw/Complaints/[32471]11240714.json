IT WILL RESTART AFTER ABOUT 30 SECONDS.  AFTER IT HAS BEEN DRIVEN ABOUT 25-40 MILES IT STOPS HAPPENING.  WE HAVE PAID FOR TOTAL VEHICLE INSPECTIONS, WE HAVE  ALSO PAID $1300 TO HAVE EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM A CERTIFIED CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP CAN FIND FIXED.  THIS DID NOT HELP THE PROBLEM AT ALL AND THE DEALERSHIP SAYS THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH THE SUV.   THIS IS THE CAR OUR SON DRIVES AND WE ARE VERY CONCERNED.  WE ARE NOT IN A FINANCIAL POSITION TO REPLACE THE VEHICLE AND HAVE NOW EMPTIED OUR SAVINGS TO HAVE THE VEHICLE COMPLETELY SERVICED, INSPECTED AND REPAIRED.",
