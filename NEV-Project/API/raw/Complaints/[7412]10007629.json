IT WORKED FINE IN HOT OR WARM WEATHER, BUT DOES NOT WORK WHEN IT IS VERY  COLD.  THAT FEATURE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME, AND FEEL THAT THEY ARE MISLEADING CUSTOMERS WHEN THEY SAY IT HAS RECYCLE AIR, BUT DON'T THEN TELL YOU THAT IT DOESN'T WORK WHEN THE WEATHER IS COLD.  IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO ABOUT THIS.  I'M STUCK BUYING THIS CAR FOR 6 MORE YEARS.  I PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE, HAD I KNOWN THE RECYCLE AIR DID NOT WORK ALL THE TIME.  I PREVIOUSLY HAD A HONDA AND A MITSUBISHI THAT WORKED JUST FINE IN ANY KIND OF WEATHER.  I SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT, \"IT DOES NOT WORK WHEN IT IS COLD!\"",
