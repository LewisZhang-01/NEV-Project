I WAS ASSURED THAT THE PROBLEM WOULD BE CORRECTED. TO DATE IT HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED.I GAVE UP ON WILKENS BUICK (ON THE 2ND RETURN OF VEHICLE) WHEN THEY TOLD ME THAT I WOULD NOT BE GIVEN A RENTAL BUT WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IT MYSELF. AGIAN THIS WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM TO THEM, THEY ARE THE ONE'S THAT MADE ME AWARE OF IT. CAR STALLS EVEYTIME THAT YOU ARE COMING TO A STOP AND ON OCCASION GOING DOWN A HILL AND JUST LETTING UP ON GAS PEDAL. THIS IS A VERY HEAVY VEHICLE AND AT THIS POINT EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO BE ON THE HIGHWAY, DUE TO INABILITY TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE STEERING WHEN THE ENGINE DIES.I CURRENTLY HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE AT 3 DIFFERENT REPAIR FACILITIES SINCE 12/13/2002, AND AGAIN TO DATE THE PROBLEM STILL PRESIST.",
