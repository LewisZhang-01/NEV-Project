        "summary": "1999 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE LAREDO, 6CYL.  MILEAGE 78000.  DURING REFUELING, FUEL WOULD NOT ENTER GAS TANK.  AFTER HAVING ONE DEALER LOOK AND STATE IT NEEDED GAS FILLER TUBE WHICH WOULD HAVE TO BE ORDERED.  I MANAGE TO GET GAS IN CAR AND GET HOME FROM 200 MILES AWAY.  THE NEXT TIME I DROVE VEHICLE I NOTICE GAS LEAKING UNDER THE VEHICLE.  TOOK TO LOCAL DLR, THEY HAD TO REPLACE FUEL LINE TO GAS TANK AND FILLER TUBE.  THIS WAS A $470.00 REPAIR.  THIS IS THE 2ND TIME I HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE FUEL TANK SYSTEM ON THIS JEEP.  THIS IS A VARY SERIOUS SITUATION DUE TO FUMES GETTING INTO THE PASSENGER AREA AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A FIRE FROM LEAKING FUEL RUNNING UNDERNEATH THE CAR.  TWO OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THIS CAR IS THE TRANSFER CASE LEAKS DUE TO A BAD O-RING(THIS IS A 10 CENT PART THAT COST $500.00 TO REPLACE BECAUSE THE TRANSFER CASE HAS TO BE TAKEN APART), FRONT WHEEL BEARING GOING BAD @ 78000 MILES, REPLACEMENT COST $400.00.
