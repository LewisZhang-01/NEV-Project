        "summary": "EVER SINCE I PURCHASED THE MOTORCYCLE, A 2004 HONDA REBEL, THERE WERE A FEW PROBLEMS WITH THE SHIFTING CHARACTERISTICS.  FIRST, WHILE DOWNSHIFTING, EXCESS FORCE WAS SOMETIMES REQUIRED TO SHIFT TO THE NEXT LOWER GEAR. SECOND, AFTER PULLING IN THE CLUTCH LEVER, THE MOTORCYLE SEEMED TO WANT TO CREEP FOWARD.  THIRD, DIFFUCULTY SHIFTING TO NEUTRAL WHILE STOPPED.    EVERY ONE I ASKED SAID THAT THIS WAS NORMAL FOR THIS PARTICULAR BIKE.  NOW, I FIND THIS HARD TO BELIEVE.  IT HAS BEEN JUST SLIGHTLY OVER ONE YEAR AND ABOUT 8000 MILES SINCE I PURCHASED THIS MOTORCYCLE, AND THE CLUTCH STARTED TO SHOW SIGNS OF SLIPPING.  I DID NOT HAVE THE TIME OR THE MONEY TO HAVE THE DEALER REPLACE THE CLUTCH, NOW THAT THE MOTORCYLE HAS SUPASSED THE ONE YEAR WARRANTY.  AFTER REPLACING THE CLUTCH WITH GENUINE HONDA PARTS, THE CLUTCH SHIFTS SMOOTHER THAN IT EVER DID.  THE OLD PARTS WERE DISCARDER, SINCE I DID NOT WANT OILY, USELESS PARTS IN MY HOME.    THIS FAILURE CAN NOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE LACK OF MAINTAINANCE, BECAUSE THE MOTORCYCLE HAS BEEN PROFESSIONALY, PER MAINTAINANCE CONTRACT WITH SELLING DEALER.",
