AT RANDOM, AND WHEN MAKING A LEFT ONTO A BUSY STREET, ACCELERATING FROM A STOP LIGHT,  THERE IS A HESITATION AND A VERY QUICK SHUT DOWN WHEN ACCELERATING. IT RE-ENGAGES JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT A POTENTIAL CRASH.  I TALKED TO THE HYUNDAI MECHANIC ABOUT THIS.  THEY TEST DROVE IT, BUT SINCE THE PROBLEM IS RANDOM, IT WOULD MAKE SENSE THAT THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO DETECT IT DURING THE TEST DRIVE. THE PROBLEM ISN'T MAJOR FOR NOW BUT ALL IT TAKES IS ONE EVENT TO MAKE IT SO.  I WAS RELIEVED TO SEE OTHER COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME PROBLEM ON THIS WEBSITE.   *TR",
