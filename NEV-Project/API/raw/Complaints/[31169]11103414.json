WITHIN FIVE MONTHS OF OWNING THE VEHICLE, THE CONTACT TOOK IT TO MORE THAN ONE DEALER BECAUSE THE VEHICLE JERKED AND MADE AN ABNORMAL NOISE. INTEGRITY CHEVROLET OF CHATTANOOGA (2110 CHAPMAN RD, CHATTANOOGA, TN, 423-535-9455) AND MOUNTAIN VIEW CHEVROLET (310 E 20TH ST, CHATTANOOGA, TN, 423-266-0181) WERE CONTACTED AND THE TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF OWNING THE VEHICLE; HOWEVER, THE TRANSMISSION CONTINUED TO MAKE AN ABNORMAL NOISE. THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. IN ADDITION, THE BRAKE PEDAL TRAVELED TO THE FLOORBOARD WITHOUT WARNING. WHEN IT RELEASED, THE BRAKE PEDAL SEIZED AND CAUSED THE CONTACT TO DRIVE THROUGH A RED LIGHT, WHICH ALMOST CAUSED A CRASH. THE CONTACT HAD TO APPLY EXTREME FORCE TO THE BRAKE PEDAL TO STOP THE VEHICLE. A PASSERBY ALERTED THE CONTACT THAT THE BRAKE LIGHTS FAILED TO ILLUMINATE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED AND OPENED A CASE. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED AND THE FAILURES CONTINUED. THE CONTACT WAS WAITING FOR A RESPONSE FROM THE MANUFACTURER. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS NOT AVAILABLE.",
