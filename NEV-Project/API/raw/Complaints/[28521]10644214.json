        "summary": "I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE IN 2012 AND THE STEERING COLUMN HAS ALWAYS MADE A WEIRD NOISE.  IN SEPTEMBER OF 2014 WHILE DRIVING WITH MY 1 AND 2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTERS IN THE VEHICLE THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT ALTOGETHER.  I GOT THE POWER STEERING PUMP REPLACED THE FOLLOWING DAY.  HOWEVER, THIS WAS JUST A SHORT, TEMPORARY FIX (ABOUT A WEEK).  THE STEERING COLUMN MAKES EVEN A LOUDER AND GREATER NOISE BUT THE POWER STEERING COMES AND GOES.  IT IS VERY STIFF ALL OF THE TIME.  MAKES DRIVING A REAL CHORE, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LIVE WAY OUT OF TIME ON CURVY BACK ROADS.  IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE AN ACCIDENT OCCURS BECAUSE THE STEERING WILL BE FINE FOR A MINUTE THEN YOU GO TO TURN AND IT VANISHES AND YOU HAVE TO PULL ON THE STEERING WHEEL TO GET IT TO TURN.  THIS IS NOT SAFE FOR MYSELF, FAMILY, OR OTHERS ON THE ROAD.  I SEE MANY OTHERS HAVE HAD SIMILAR ISSUES.  I DO NOT LIKE THE FACT THAT I HAVE TO WORRY EVERY TIME I GET BEHIND THE WHEEL BY MYSELF OR WITH MY CHILDREN IN THE CAR IF I AM GOING TO MAKE IT SOMEWHERE SAFELY.  PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS ISSUE.  *TR",
