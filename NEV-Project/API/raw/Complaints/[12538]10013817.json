SYMPTOMS ARE GETTING PROGRESSIVELY WORSE.    ADVISED BY DEALER THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH THE CIVIC......MAY TAKE UPWARDS OF THREE WEEKS TO GET PARTS......MAY EVENTUALLY TURN INTO A RECALL.......MEANWHILE, CONTRARY TO ANYONE WITH ANY TYPE OF COMMON SENSE, HONDA EXPECTS US TO KEEP DRIVING THE CAR.  I ASKED IF THEY WOULD RECOMMEND ANYONE IGNORING THE SYMPTOMS,...THEY SAID NO!.  BUT STILL EXPECT ME TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE.  TYPICAL ATTITUDE THAT NOTHING WILL BE DONE UNTIL SOMEONE GETS KILLED!   *NLM",
