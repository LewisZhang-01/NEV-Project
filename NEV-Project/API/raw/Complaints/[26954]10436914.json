WE WERE FORTUNATE THAT SEVERAL DRIVERS IN THE ONCOMING LANE WERE CONCERNED AND CONSCIENTIOUS AND FLASHED THEIR HIGH BEAMS TO SIGNAL THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG. DEDUCTIVELY, I RULED OUT MY LIGHTS BEING OFF BECAUSE THE SWITCH WAS ON. THAT WAS UNTIL THE TRAFFIC LIGHT TURNED RED AND I SAW NO REFLECTION ON THE BACK OF THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME! I FLIPPED THE SWITCH OFF THEN BACK ON AGAIN TO SEE IF IT WAS A BAD CONNECTION IN THE SWITCH OR PERHAPS IT WAS BETWEEN POSITIONS AND WOULD POSSIBLY WORK IF I REPOSITIONED IT. NO GOOD! UGH, THE LIGHT WENT GREEN! I NERVOUSLY PULLED AT THE BRIGHT LIGHT SELECTOR TO SEE IF THEY WORKED! JUST IN TIME TO BARELY MISS THE SUV THAT OBVIOUSLY DID NOT SEE US!!! I DID NOT LET IT GO UNTIL WE WERE SAFE AT HOME!!! PHEW!!! I GUESS NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO CHANGE MY PANTS!  *TR",
