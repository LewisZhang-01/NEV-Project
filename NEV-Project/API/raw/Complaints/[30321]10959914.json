THE SAFETY'S PROBLEM IN THIS CAR IS:  THAT YOU CAN REMOVE THE KEY FROM THE IGNITION WHILE THE CAR'S ENGINE IS STILL RUNNING, REMOVE THE KEYS FROM THE IGNITION WHEN THE GEAR IN OTHER THAN PARK GEAR, OR ENGINE SHUTS OFF AND VEHICLE NOT IN PARK. MY WIFE WAS INJURED YESTERDAY BECAUSE THE CAR WAS NOT IN PARK AND THE VEHICLE SQUEEZED HER BETWEEN AN OPEN DOOR AND A POLE OUTSIDE.   THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE IN THIS CAR THE ENGINE SHUTS OFF AND SHE WAS ABLE TO REMOVE THE KEY FROM IGNITION WHILE THE CAR IN NEUTRAL... THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY  ISSUE WHEN THE KEY CAN BE REMOVED WHILE THE ENGINE IS STILL RUNNING OR IN ANY OTHER GEAR  OTHER THAN THE PARK STATUS.....  THIS IS ALL HAPPENED IN A PARKING LOT. STATIONARY AND RIGHT AFTER SHE PARKED THE CAR .",
