WENT TO CHECK TRANSMISSION FLUID AND FOUND THAT THE DIPSTICK IS LOCKED INTO PLACE.  DID SOME QUICK RESEARCH TO FIND OUT HOW TO CHECK FLUID LEVEL AND THEN FOUND OUT ABOUT ISSUE WITH NISSAN PATHFINDERS RADIATORS HAVING A PROBLEM WITH LEAKING COOLANT INTO THE TRANSMISSION COOLING SYSTEM.  CHECKED RADIATOR AND FOUND FROTHING FOAM ON THE INSIDE OF THE PRESSURE CAP INDICATING THAT THE RADIATOR HAD FAILED.  CONTACTED DEALERSHIP AND ASKED THEM WHY THE SECTION OF THE INSPECTION FOR THE COOLING SYSTEM AND TRANSMISSION SYSTEM WERE CHECKED AS \"OK\".  DID NOT RECEIVE AN ANSWER.  ALSO, WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED BY NISSAN ABOUT THE ISSUE WITH RADIATOR IN OUR NISSAN.  THE VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY PARKED SINCE THE DEALERSHIP SAID IT WOULD COST UP TO $3000 DOLLARS IN REPAIRS UNDER THE AGREEMENT REACHED.    I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS WAS NOT A RECALL.  THIS SITUATION COULD OF CAUSED A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THE TRANSMISSION AT SPEED WHILE DRIVING OR CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THE ENGINE BECAUSE OF LACK OF COOLING CAUSING THE ENGINE TO SEIZE UP AT SPEED WHILE DRIVING.",
