        "summary": "THIS IS A LOW-MILEAGE HYUNDAI AWD SANTA FE LIMITED WITH 19\" ALLOW RIMS.  AT ABOUT 11,500 MILES I NOTICED GREASE ON THE INSIDE OF THE FRONT-LEFT WHEEL.  IT WAS THICK AND GREEN IN COLOR, THE GREASE USED TO LUBRICATE THE AXLE JOINT.  THE CENTRIFUGAL FORCE FROM THE AXLE SPRAYED THE GREASE ALONG THE INSIDE OF THE WHEEL.  I CHECKED THE CV BOOT AND AXLE AND IT APPEARED THE GREASE WAS LEAKING FROM THE SEAL BETWEEN THE BOOT AND THE AXLE HUB.  THERE WAS A VERY SLIGHT LEAKAGE COMING FROM THE RIGHT WHEEL AXLE AS WELL.  THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN WITH A VEHICLE ONLY A YEAR OLD.  I TOOK IT TO THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP AND THEY CONFIRMED THE LEAKAGE ON BOTH WHEELS AND ORDERED TWO AXLE SEAL KITS, WHICH WILL INCLUDE REPLACEMENT OF THE JOINT.  THERE WAS NO CHARGE FOR THE INSPECTION AND THERE WILL BE NO CHARGE FOR THE REPAIR.  IF THIS WENT UNNOTICED IT COULD CAUSE AN AXLE TO OVERHEAT AND FAIL.  AT HIGH SPEEDS THIS COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.",
