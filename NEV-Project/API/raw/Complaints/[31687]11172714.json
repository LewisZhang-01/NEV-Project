WHEN ON THE HIGHWAY GOING OVER 55MPH AND THE JEEP GOES OVER A BUMP THE STEERING WHEEL BEGINS TO SHAKE AND VIBRATE AND DOES THIS UNTIL YOU SLOW DOWN TO BELOW 30MPH WHICH IS VERY SCARY AND UNSAFE ON THE HIGHWAY.  THE DAMPER HAS BEEN REPLACED 3 TIMES BUT ITS STILL DOING THE SAME THING.  I HAVE VIDEO FROM MY JEEP BUT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF VIDEOS ON THE INTERNET OF OTHER KEEPS THAT HAVE THE SAME ISSUE.",
