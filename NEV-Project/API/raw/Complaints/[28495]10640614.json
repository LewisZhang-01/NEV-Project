ONE THERE THE CAR LIGHTS CAME ON THE CHECK ENGINE, RED BOLT LIGHTS AND THE OIL LIGHT. AFTER A FEW MINUTES I STARTED CAR AND IT STALLED THEN STARTED BUT WAS A ROCKY START. I SHUT IT OFF AND RESTARTED. THE CAR WORKED FINE. THEN 3 MONTHS LATER THE CAR DID THE SAME TIME. THIS WHEN I PLACED IT IN THE SHOP THEY SAID IT WAS THE TRANSMISSION. SO $1400 DOLLARS LATER AND 5 DAYS I PICKED UP MY CAR AND 3 MILES AWAY FROM SHOP THE CAR DID THE SAME THING AGAIN. I TOOK IT BACK THEY DID A TEST THE CODES WHERE COMING BACK AS A WEIRD CODES. THEY DID NOT HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER SO THEY DID A THROTTLE CLEAN. CAR WORKED FINE. NEXT 3 MONTHS.
