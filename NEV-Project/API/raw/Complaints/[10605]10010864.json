I HAVE ALSO HEARD MANY SIMILAR COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE IN CAR CLUBS AND INTERNET MESSAGE BOARDS.  PEOPLE REFER TO THE STOCK ROTORS AS JUNK BECAUSE THEY WARP SO OFTEN WHICH LEADS ME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE CAR MANUFACTURE DID NOT PUT ADEQUATELY DESIGNED ROTORS ON THE VEHICLES.  PEOPLE WITH THIS ISSUE SAY TO BUY NON-OEM ROTORS BECAUSE THEY WILL WARP AGAIN AND SIMPLY HAVING THE ROTORS TURNED DOES NOT HELP AS THEY WARP AGAIN. I HAVE ACTUALLY HAD MY ROTORS TURNED AND NEW BRAKES (INSTALLED BY DEALERSHIP WITH OEM PARTS) PUT ON THE CAR AND I HAVE THE WARPING ISSUE.  MECHANICS THAT I KNOW ALSO AGREE THAT THE BRAKES/ROTORS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY DESIGNED FOR THESE VEHICLES.    *NLM",
