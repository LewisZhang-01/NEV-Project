        "summary": "THIS IS A COMPLAINT FOR A 2005 LOTUS ELISE OIL LINE FAILURE.  I PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TWO OIL LINE FAILURES TOGETHER BUT IN RETROSPECT SHOULD HAVE REPORTED THEM INDIVIDUALLY AS THEY OCCURRED AT SEPARATE TIMES.  THE FIRST OIL LINE FAILURE OCCURRED ON 3/29/2010.  I CAME OUT TO MY CAR IN THE PARKING LOT AND THERE WAS A LARGE PUDDLE OF OIL UNDER IT.  I DID NOT EVER SEE A DROP OF OIL FROM THE CAR PREVIOUSLY.  I PAID 1,066 TO GET THE DRIVER SIDE OIL LINE REPAIRED.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE OIL LINE SHOULD BE FIXED BUT I WAS NOT TOLD THAT IF IT FAILED WHILE DRIVING THAT I COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE CONTROL OF THE CAR.  THE PASSENGER SIDE OIL LINE DID INDEED FAIL 4 MONTHS LATER BUT THIS TIME WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY GOING 55 MPH.  THE ENTIRE OIL CAPACITY OF THE ENGINE SPRAYED ONTO THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT AND REAR TIRES AS WELL AS THE WINDSHIELD. NOT ONLY WAS IT LIKE DRIVING ON A SHEET OF ICE, I COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING.  LUCKILY THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE LANE NEXT TO ME AS I SLID INTO IT.  I WAS ABLE TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE CAR AND PULL OVER.  BY THE TIME I PULLED OVER THE ENGINE WAS RUINED REQUIRING ME TO PAY APPROXIMATELY 8,000 FOR A NEW ENGINE AND NEW OIL LINES.  I HAVE PICTURES OF THE CAR SHOWING THE ENTIRE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR COVERED IN OIL.   UPDATED 08-29/11 *BF     *KB  UPDATED 05/03/12",
