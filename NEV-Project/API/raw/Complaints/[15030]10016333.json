        "summary": "I HAVE JUST TRADED MY 2001 HONDA ACCORD LX MANUAL TRANSMISSION VIN#[XXX] BECAUSE OF A SEVERE IDLING PROBLEM.  THE CAR HAD ONLY 12,000 MILES AND HAD  ALL THE ROUTINE MAINTENANCE PERFORMED AS RECOMMENDED BY HONDA.  IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.  I HAVE OWNED A HONDA FOR OVER 20 YEARS AND HAVE DRIVEN A STICK SHIFT FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS.  I AM VERY WELL AWARE OF THE PLACEMENT OF THE PEDALS.  ALSO, THE FLOOR MAT WAS ATTACHED TO ITS PIN NEAR THE FRONT OF THE SEAT SO IT DID NOT IMPEDE MY USE OF THE PEDALS.  I HAD THE IDLE GO ABSOLUTELY NUTS, ALMOST RED LINE, AFTER HAVING PARKED THE CAR FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN RESTARTING THE CAR.  THIS HAPPENED 3 TIMES OVER ABOUT 6 MONTHS.  THE FIRST TWO TIMES, THE CAR LURCHED FORWARD.  LUCKILY, NO ONE OR ANY PROPERTY WAS DAMAGED.  I HAD BOTH CROWN HONDA OF CHAPEL HILL, NC AND FLOW HONDA OF WINSTON-SALEM, NC CHECK THE CAR OUT.  IN FACT, FLOW HAD THE CAR 3 WEEKS AFTER THE 3RD INCIDENT.  NEITHER DEALER SAID THEY FOUND A PROBLEM WITH THE CAR.    I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE THIS CAR ALTHOUGH I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY DRIVING THE CAR.  MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS CAR WILL BE SOLD TO SOMEONE WHO WILL NOT BE TOLD OF THE PROBLEM I HAVE EXPERIENCED.  I FEEL THIS CAR IS DANGEROUS AND SOMEONE MAY HAVE AN ACCIDENT.  I HAVE ALSO CONTACTED HONDA CORPORATE.  I HOPE YOU WILL LOOK INTO THIS PROBLEM.  I HAVE RESEARCHED THE INTERNET TO FIND IF ANYONE ELSE HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM.  I HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL.  HONDA SAYS THEY HAVE NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM.  I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS AN EASY OR HARD FIX.  I DO BELIEVE THIS CAR HAS A MAJOR PROBLEM.  THANK YOU.   *NLM      INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
