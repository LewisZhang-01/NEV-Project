I WAS AMAZED TO FIND THESE LINES TOTALLY UNPROTECTED AND VULNERABLE TO ROAD HAZARD DAMAGE.  DUE TO THEIR PROXIMITY TO THE EXHAUST I'M CONCERNED WITH A RUPTURE AND FIRE.  I HAVE PICTURES AVAILABLE TO SHOW THE LOCATION OF THESE LINES BUT AM UNABLE TO ATTACH THEM TO THIS TYPE OF FILE.  THIS IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN!",
