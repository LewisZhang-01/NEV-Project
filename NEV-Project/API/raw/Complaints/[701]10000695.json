        "summary": "AN ACCIDENT OCCURED IN MY 2002 AUDI A4 WITH THE NEW-FOR-2002 CVT TRANSMISSION (CONTINUOUSLY VARIABLE TRANSMISSION) RESULTING FROM A CONDITION THAT I BELIEVE IS DEFECTIVE RELATING TO THE FUNCTION OF THE TRANSMISSION.  AFTER DEPRESSING THE ACCELERATOR FROM A DEAD STOP, THERE IS A LONG LAG BETWEEN BEFORE THE VEHICLE BEGINS TO MOVE.  AS A RESULT, IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE QUICKLY IN TRAFFIC, ONE MUST PRESS THE ACCELERATOR ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR IN ADVANCE.  THIS CAN CAUSE SERIOUS PROBLEMS IF ONE MUST QUICKLY STOP, RIGHT AFTER STARTING.  IN THIS CASE, MY FIANCE ACCIDENTALLY HIT THE REAR OF THE CAR IN FRONT OF HER AT A LIGHT WHEN THEY QUICKLY STOPPED JUST AFTER STARTING.",
