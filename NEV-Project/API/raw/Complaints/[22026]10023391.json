I CONSULTED THE DEALER ABOUT IT, BUT THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME TO PAINT THE CAR, SINCE THE WARRANTY WAS EXPIRED.  PRIOR TO THIS, I HAD IT LOOKED AT BY ANOTHER PARTY WHO SAID THAT FORD SHOULD PAINT IT AT NO CHARGE TO ME BECAUSE THE PAINT AND PRIMER WERE BOTH DEFECTIVE, THUS CAUSING THE PAINT TO COME OFF.  I CALLED FORD MOTOR COMPANY, BUT THEY WOULDN'T HELP.  THE OWNER'S MANUAL SAYS THE METAL HAS TO BE \"PERFORATED\" BEFORE FORD WOULD COVER THE PAINT.  I FEEL THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE PAINTED THE VEHICLE WHEN THE PROBLEM WAS FIRST REPORTED.  EVEN IF THEY JUST PAINTED THE ROOF AND NOT THE WHOLE VEHICLE, I WOULD HAVE BEEN SATISFIED WITH THAT.
