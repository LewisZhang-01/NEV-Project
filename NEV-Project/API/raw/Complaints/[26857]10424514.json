        "summary": "WHILE DECENDING A MOUNTIAN PASS IN COLORADO WITH THE VEHICLE IN 4WD-LOW RANGE AND THE SHIFT SELECTOR IN THE SPORT MODE THE TRANSMISSION WOULD UP-SHIFT AT ABOUT 3200 RPM CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO GAIN SPEED VERY QUICKLY AND REQUIRING THE CONSTANT APPLICATION OF BRAKES WHICH CAUSES THE BRAKES TO OVER HEAT. THE OWNERS MANUAL CLEARLY STATES THAT THIS IS AN APPROVED USE OF THE VEHICLE AND THAT THE TRANSMISSION SHOULD NOT SHIFT UNTIL THE RED-ZONE (APPROX 6000 RPM). I CONTACTED KIA CUSTOMER SERVICE IN NOVEMBER OF 2009 AND HAVE HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH KIA'S CUSTOMER SERVICE AND MR RICHARD PULRIDIA WHITH KIA SERVICE HAS EVALUATED THE VEHICLE AND FILED A REPORT WITH KIA ENGINEERING IN MAY 2011. I TALKED TO MR PULRIDA THIS WEEK AND HE HAS NOT RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION TO DATE AND HAS NO IDEA WHEN OR IF ANY ACTION WILL BE TAKEN TO CORRECT THIS UNSAFE CONDITION. I BELIEVE THIS OPERATION IS UNSAVE BECAUSE IT CAUSES QUICK ACCELLERATION TO UNSAFE SPEEDS WHIN IN A STEEP DECENT.  *TR",
