        "summary": "WE HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE AUTOMATIC SLIDING DOORS ON OUR MINIVAN SINCE THE ORIGINAL DATE OF PURCHASE.  WHEN USING THE REMOTE OR INTERIOR BUTTONS TO CLOSE DOORS, THEY FREQUENTLY MALFUNCTION.  WHEN TRYING TO CLOSE THE DOORS, SOMETIMES THERE IS JUST A CLICKING NOISE AND THE DOOR DOES NOT CLOSE AT ALL.  OTHER TIMES, THE DOOR CLOSES AND THEN IMMEDIATELY POPS RIGHT BACK OPEN.  OFTEN WHEN TRYING TO CLOSE THE DOORS MANUALLY, THE DOORS FAIL TO LATCH.  OTHER TIMES, THE DOORS GET STUCK IN AN OPEN POSITION AND WE ARE UNABLE TO CLOSE THEM, EITHER MANUALLY OR ELECTRONICALLY.  WE HAVE TAKEN THE VAN TO THE DEALERSHIP ON TWO DIFFERENT OCCASIONS AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM, OR THEY SIMPLY STATE THAT THERE IS NOT A PROBLEM.  THIS PAST SUMMER THE \"MOTOR\" WHICH OPERATES THE DOOR CLOSING SYSTEM WAS REPLACED.  THE MOST RECENT EVENT OCCURED ON 2/3/03.  THIS TIME THE SLIDING DOOR CAME OPEN WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION.  WE IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THEY ONCE AGAIN CLAIMED THAT THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS VEHICLE DEFECT THAT COULD RESULT IN INJURY OR DEATH.",
