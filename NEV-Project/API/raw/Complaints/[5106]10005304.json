IN A BAD RAIN STORM THIS MORNING, AND NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME MY WIPERS JUST STOPPED. I ALMOST WRECKED AND HAD TO PULL OVER TO THE LEFT SIDE OF A FOUR LANE HIGHWAY  BECAUSE I COULDN'T SEE UNTIL THEY JUST STARTED UP AGAIN. I WAS VERY LATE FOR WORK. I NEVER KNOW WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO STOP. MY SISTER HAS THE SAME MODEL , MAKE AND YEAR CAR. HER WIPERS HAD BEEN STOPPING ON HER FOR TWO YEARS OFF AND ON. HERS FINALLY JUST QUIT COMPLETELY. EVEN AFTER ALL THE TIMES OF TAKING IT IN TO BE FIXED. ONE OF MY WORK ASSOCIATES HAS THE SAME TROUBLE WITH HIS GMC VAN.",
