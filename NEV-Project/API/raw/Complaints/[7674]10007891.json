HOWEVER, IT WAS NOT NOTICED UNTIL AFTER I HAD BEEN IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHEREAS THE 4WD WAS NEEDED SUCH AS SNOW AND ICE.  ONE ONCE OCCASION I NARROWLY AVOIDED AN ACCIDENT AND BECAME STUCK.  I HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE SUBMITTED FOR REPAIRS AT THE DEALERSHIP AND SUBSEQUENTLY INFORMED THE REPAIRS WERE REQUIRED DUE TO A MALFUNCTIONED VACUUM LINE.  THE REPAIRS WERE REQUIRED THREE TIMES BEFORE I FINALLY RETURNED THE VEHICLE AND DEMANDED A MORE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THE PROBLEM.  I WAS THEN INFORMED PARTS WOULD NEED TO BE ORDERED FOR CORRECTION OF THE DEFICIENCY.  I HAVE STILL NOT RECEIVED THE VEHICLE BACK FROM REPAIRS.",
