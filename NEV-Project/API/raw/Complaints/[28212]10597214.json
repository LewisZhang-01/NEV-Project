        "summary": "VEHICLE PURCHASED FROM LARRY H. MILLER CAR SALES, ON FEBRUARY 2ND,2014.  A NEW JEEP COMPASS 2014.  THE THIRD DAY AFTER PURCHASE I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN TO REPORT PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE.  1: A LOUD NOISE IN THE REAR BRAKES. 2:  REAR WINDOWS IN THE VEHICLE WENT DOWN BY THEMSELVES WHEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE. 3:  FRONT PASSENGER DOOR COULD NOT BE UNLOCKED  WITH THE KEY.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN THREE TIMES FOR THESE REPAIRS. THE ONLY THING THAT WAS REPAIRED WAS THE FRONT PASSENGER DOOR LOCK. THE WINDOWS GOING DOWN WERE NEVER EVEN LOOKED AT, THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  THE LOUD NOISE IN THE REAR BRAKES WAS CHECKED BY THE TECHNICIANS, THREE TIMES AND THEIR ANSWER FOR THE PROBLEM WAS THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE BRAKES AND THAT WAS JUST A CHARACTERISTIC OF THAT MODEL (JEEP COMPASS).  I ASKED TO BE PUT IN A DIFFERENT VEHICLE, BECAUSE I AM AND WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE STABILITY OF THE VEHICLE. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE SERVICE I RECEIVED AND IN THE VEHICLE THAT WAS SOLD TO ME.  THE NOISE IN THE REAR BRAKES IS OF GREAT CONCERN TO ME, AS FAR AS THE DEPENDABILITY AND SAFETY. I DO NOT WANT TO KEEP THIS VEHICLE.  I BELIEVE IT IS A LEMON.  *TR",
