THE DRIVER HAD BEEN FOLLOWING US FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE MILE AND HIS TRUCK WAS COVERED WITH DIESEL FUEL FROM OUR NEW FORD F250.  APPARENTLY THE FUEL SYSTEM HAD STARTED LEAKING.

WE PULLED INTO THE PARKING LOT AND NOTED THE REAR AND UNDERSIDE OF THE TRUCK WERE COATED WITH DIESEL FUEL.  FUEL CONTINUED TO LEAK UNTIL WE SHUT OFF THE ENGINE.  APPARENTLY THE FUEL SYSTEM WAS DAMAGED OR DEFECTIVE.  WE HAVE HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO CAPE FEAR FORD IN WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA.*JB",
