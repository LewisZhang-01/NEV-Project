NOW THIS TRANSMISSION HAS FAILED WITH ONLY 40,000 ON IT. SAME PROBLEM AS BEFORE, RUST ON DIPSTICK AND FLUID BURNED.  WHEN I CONTACTED GENERAL MOTORS THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. I'M ASKING FOR HELP. I'VE READ SEVERAL OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT RUST ON DIPSTICK AND IN TRANSMISSION. I'M AFRAID TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON THIS THINKING IT MIGHT HAPPEN AGAIN. PLEAS LOOK INTO THIS. THANK YOU.   *NLM",
