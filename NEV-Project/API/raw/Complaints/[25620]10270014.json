        "summary": "MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING UP I-85 AND OUR ACCORD JUST STOPPED ACCELERATING AND THE TRANSMISSION WENT TO 6000 RPM+ BUT THE CAR WOULD NOT GO ANY WHERE, TRAFFIC WAS SPEEDING UP BEHIND HIM AND HE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. HE GOT THE CAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND SAT THERE FOR IT TO COOL DOWN SOME. NO LIGHTS WERE ON STATING THAT THERE WAS ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR. HE WAITED AWHILE AND STARTED THE CAR BACK UP AND IT ONLY MADE IT FOR ABOUT 15 MORE MILES BEFORE THE TRANSMISSION STARTED NOT WORKING AGAIN. THIS TIME THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. THERE WAS NO OTHER WARNING OR NO PROBLEMS BEFORE THIS TO ANY INDICATION THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING WRONG WITH THE TRANSMISSION. I PURCHASED THE HONDA NEW IN 2004, THINKING THAT HONDA WAS A GREAT CAR (SINCE MY DAD IS AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC AND TOLD ME THAT I COULD NOT GO WRONG WITH A HONDA), NOT KNOWING THAT ONLY AFTER 4 1/2 YEARS LATER I WOULD BE FACED WITH A BAD TRANSMISSION AND MY HUSBAND ALMOST BEING RUN DOWN ON THE INTERSTATE BECAUSE THE CAR WOULD JUST STOP WORKING! I AM WAITING FOR HONDA TO CONTACT ME BACK ABOUT THE REPAIRS, BUT HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY WILL PROBABLY NOT HELP WITH ANY COSTS OR RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE 2003 TRANSMISSIONS IN THEIR VEHICLES. I HAVE READ NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE MAKERS EARLY 2000 TRANSMISSIONS AND THE SAME PROBLEM IS REPORTED OVER AND OVER AGAIN.I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANYTHING FROM HONDA STATING THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSIONS.  MY HUSBAND AND I TRANSPORT OUR 2 SMALL CHILDREN IN THIS VEHICLE AS WELL, AND WE THOUGHT THAT WE WERE IN A VERY SAFE VEHICLE, UNTIL THIS INCIDENT TODAY.   PLEASE DO NOT LET SOMEONE BE KILLED BEFORE ANYTHING IS DONE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. THANK YOU! *TR",
