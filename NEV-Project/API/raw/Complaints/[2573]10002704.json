FIRST ONE FAILED, DEALER REPLACED BUT INFORMED US ONE FAILED COIL WOULD BE REPLACED, NOT ALL 4 EVEN THOUGH VW KNOWS THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THIS TYPE OF COIL. THEY WILL NOT ISSUE A RECALL, BUT BECAUSE SO MANY ARE FAILING, THERE IS A BACKORDER ON THE PARTS. DUE TO THE HIGH DEMMAND, THEY WILL ONLY REPLACE FAILED COILS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH COILS TO DUE THE RIGHT THING, REPLACE THEM ALL. THEIR RESPONSE IS TO HAVE THE CUSTOMER TURN OFF THE CAR, CALL ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE, AND WAIT FOR A TOW. 18 MILES AFTER THE FIRST FAILURE, A SECOND FAILURE OCCURRED. WE CALLED ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE, AND WERE INFORMED IT IS USUALLY A 90 MINUTE WAIT. WE LIVE IN MASSACHUSETTS, IT IS WINTER, AND THE CAR IS USED TO TRANSPORT AN 8 WEEK OLD AND A 3 YEAR OLD. VW WANTS THEM TO WAIT WITHOUT HEAT UNTIL A TOW ARRIVES. I CONTACTED VW CUSTOMER CARE AND WAS GIVEN THE COMPANY LINE. THEY FAIL TO SEE THE DANGER IN HAVING TWO CHILDREN WAITING IN BELOW-FREEZING TEMPS FOR A TOW. THIS INCIDENT HAS SO CHANGED HOW I VIEW VW AND HAS BASICALLY RENDERED A VEHICLE THAT IS LESS THAN 1 YEAR OLD USELESS. WE ARE AFRAID TO DRIVE IT, EXPECTING ANOTHER ENGINE FAILURE.",
