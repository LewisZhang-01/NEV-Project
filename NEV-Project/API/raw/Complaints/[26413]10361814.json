THE VEHICLE STARTED ACTING ERRATICALLY, SLIPPING IN AND OUT OF GEAR INTERMITTENTLY. IT WASN'T SAFE TO DRIVE ANYMORE, IE STRANDED AT STOP LIGHTS OR AFTER SLOWING FOR TRAFFIC IT HAD NO ACCELERATION. IT BECAME CLEAR AT THIS POINT THAT THE PROBLEM WASN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE DIAGNOSED AT A REPAIR FACILITY, WITHOUT REPLACING PARTS NEEDLESSLY AND THEN TEST DRIVING THE VEHICLE UNTIL IT WORKED AGAIN . I STARTED CHECKING ON LINE AND FOUND MANY OF THESE VEHICLES EXHIBITING THE SAME BEHAVIOR AND TRACED THE PROBLEM TO A DEFECTIVE ENCODER MOTOR WHICH FIXED THE PROBLEM  I FEEL THE WAY THE VEHICLE ACTED WITH THIS PROBLEM IS A VERY UNSAFE CONDITION AND SHOULD HAVE A FAIL SAFE BUILT INTO IT TO AT LEAST PREVENT COMPLETE LOSS OF ACCELERATION. AT THE VERY LEAST OWNERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN WARNED OF THIS POSSIBLE SITUATION SINCE THERE ARE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS OUT ON THIS CONDITION. *TR",
