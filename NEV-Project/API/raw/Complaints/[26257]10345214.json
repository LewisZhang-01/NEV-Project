THIS HAS HAPPENED TWICE IN ONE WEEK.  I KNOW THAT GM HAS RECALLED THE SAME THING IN THE CHEVY COBALTS.  AND THE COBALT ALSO HAD THE ISSUE WITH THE FUEL PUMP CRACKING THAT THE 2006 SATURN ION 3 HAD.  I THINK THAT THERE IS A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TWO AND THAT THE ELECTRIC POWER STEERING SHOULD ALL BE RECALLED IN THE SATURNS. *TR",
