        "summary": "REFER TO TSB# SB9601L005 /  NHTSA#  049410    THIS PAST SUMMER I CHANGED THE SPARK PLUGS AGAIN.  WHEN I PULLED THE OLD PLUGS, 4 HAD OIL SITTING ON THE TOP SIDE OF THE PLUGS AND THE PLUG BOOTS WERE COVERED WITH OIL.   2 WEEKS AGO, MY TROOPER STARTED BAD EVERYDAY, AND MOST OF THE TIME MY \"CHECK TRANS\" LIGHT WAS COMING ON, SO I HAD TO RESTART, AND MANY TIMES WHILE DRIVING FROM A STOP, THE \"CHECK TRANS\" LIGHT WOULD COME ON AGAIN, THUS DEFAULTING MY TRANSMISSION INTO 3RD GEAR, (PRETTY DANGEROUS WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO GET THROUGH AN INTERSECTION FAST IN ORDER NOT TO GET INTO AN ACCIDENT, OR PULLING INTO TRAFFIC).  LAST WEEK I PULLED THE PLUG WIRES AGAIN (OIL POOLED AGAIN).  I PULLED ALL THE PLUGS, WIPED THEM CLEAN AS WELL AS THE WIRES AND ALSO CLEANED THE PLUG TUBES AS WELL.  TROOPER RAN GREAT THEN.    I CALLED 2 ISUZU DEALERS TO ASK ABOUT THE TSB WHERE IT REFERS TO OIL IN THE SPARK PLUG WELLS, BOTH DEALERS SAID A NEW WIRE KIT HAD TO BE INSTALLED TO SEAL THE OIL LEAK (FOR AN OIL LEAK?)  I WENT AND BOUGHT A NEW \"UPDATED\" SET FOR $64.00.    FROM WHAT I'M TOLD, THE NEW WIRE SET HAS A WIDER DIAMETER TO SEAL INSIDE THE TUBES BETTER.  SATURDAY I INSTALLED THE NEW WIRES, AS WELL AS NEW SPARK PLUGS AGAIN THERE WAS OIL AGAIN ACCUMULATED WITHIN 1 DAY OF LIGHT DRIVING.   YESTERDAY I PULLED THE WIRES FROM THE TUBES THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN POOLING THE OIL. NOT ONE DROP WAS FOUND- THE NEW WIRES WORK!   WHY DIDN'T ISUZU PAY FOR THE NEW WIRES AND INSTALL THEM ON A RECALL INSTEAD OF A TSB WHERE IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY FOR THEIR MISTAKE?     WITH ALL THE OIL POOLED INSIDE 4 SPARK PLUG WELLS AND ALL OVER THE WIRES, IT GIVES THE COIL A PATH OTHER THAN THE SPARK PLUG (TO THE ENGINE, WHICH IS CHASSIS GROUND)- WHICH HAPPENS TO BE WHERE ALL ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS ARE CONNECTED IN THE VEHICLE THUS CAUSING MAJOR PROBLEMS WHEN A SHORT CIRCUIT OCCURS.  MY TROOPER IS RUNNING GREAT NOW, WITH NO APPARENT ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS IN SIGHT, AND NO OIL POOL ON THE PLUGS. TS",
