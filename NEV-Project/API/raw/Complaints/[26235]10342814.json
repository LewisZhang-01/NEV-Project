I COULD BARELY TURN THE STEERING WHEEL AND FOUR LANES OF TRAFFIC WERE DIRECTED OFF AN EXIT BECAUSE OF AN ACCIDENT CLOSING THE HIGHWAY..THIS WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT WITH NO POWER STEERING.  I GOT OFF THE HIGHWAY AND TURNED OFF MY CAR, PREPARING TO CALL A TOW TRUCK. WHEN I STARTED THE CAR AGAIN THE STEERING WORKED.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND AM NOT SURE WHAT TO DO.  I COMMUTE AN HOUR TO WORK EVERYDAY. I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR.  *TR",
