ACCORDING TO THE DEALER THIS MEANS THE RESTRAINT SYSTEM WILL NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH.  THE ALERT LIGHT THAT WARNS OF TROUBLE IN THE AIR BAG SYSTEM SEEMS TO REVERT TO NORMAL AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS, BUT  WHEN THE DEALER USES THE PROPER TEST EQUIPMENT IT CAN BE DETERMINED THE UNIT HAS FAILED.  IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT MANY VENTURES ARE BEING USED WITH FAILED PRETENSIONERS AND THEIR OWNERS ARE UNAWARE OF THE ISSUE SINCE ALL INDICATIONS FROM THE ALERT LIGHT IS THAT THE AIR BAG SYSTEM IS FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.  THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THIS ISSUE HAS HAPPENED ON MY VEHICLE IN LESS THAN FIVE YEARS AND CHEVROLET CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE IS REFUSING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE.",
