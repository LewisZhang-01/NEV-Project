WHEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND GOING OVER UNEVEN PAVEMENT, AN UNCONTROLLABLE DEATH WOBBLE OCCURS AND THE WHOLE FRONT END SHAKES VIOLENTLY (CAUSING THE TIRES TO SKIP ON THE PAVEMENT SURFACE-LOOSING TRACTION) AND THIS \"RHYTHM\"  CANNOT BE CONTROLLED UNTIL THE SPEED IS BROUGHT BELOW 25 MILES AN HOUR.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS IN A CURVE IN THE ROAD.  IT WOULD BE EASY TO LOOSE CONTROL AND CRASH INTO SOMETHING/SOMEONE!  EVERYTHING ON MY TRUCK IS FACTORY STOCK.  THE TIRES ARE GOOD AND I HAVE MADE NO MODIFICATIONS TO THE SUSPENSION.  THE DEALER ACKNOWLEDGES THE PROBLEM AND WANTS ME TO REPLACE GOOD PARTS AT MY EXPENSE WHICH DOES NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  THIS SEEMS LIKE A DEFINITE DESIGN FLAW.  THERE ARE MANY AFTERMARKET PARTS AVAILABLE THAT CLAIM TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  I DO NOT WANT TO PUT THEM ON BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GIVE FORD A REASON TO BLAME THE PROBLEM ON THE AFTERMARKET PARTS.  THIS SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING TO MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND LOOKS LIKE A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE!",
