AT NEXT OIL CHANGE, FOUND OIL TO BE MILKY-BROWN AND REEK OF COOLANT.  DEALER SERVICE CONFIRMED INTAKE GASKET LEAK AND REPAIRED AT COST OF $700 INCLUDING FOULED OXYGEN SENSOR.  PONTIAC \"CUSTOMER SERVICE\" WAS NO HELP AND WAS SOMEWHAT EVASIVE WHEN I ASKED IF SHE HAD BEEN INVOLVED WITH ANY OTHER INTAKE GASKET PROBLEMS.  WHEN I ASKED WHY GM WOULD REDESIGN THE GASKET, CHANGE COOLANT MANUFACTURERS, AND HAVE A NATIONWIDE SHORTAGE OF THE NEW GASKETS, SHE SAID SHE WAS NOT AWARE OF THESE ISSUES AND I SHOULD QUESTION MY INFORMATION AS IT WAS NOT FROM GM.  HER FINAL ADVISE, \"SAVE YOUR RECEIPT, YOU NEVER KNOW.\"  I AM SO CONSOLED.  THERE MUST BE PRESSURE APPLIED TO FORCE GM TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.    *NLM",
