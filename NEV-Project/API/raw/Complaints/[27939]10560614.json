I HAVE READ NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND FEEL THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL ON THIS COMPONENT.  I DON'T THINK THAT THIS PART SHOULD FAIL AFTER BEING ONLY A FEW YEARS OLD AND 65000 MILES AND BEING DRIVEN UNDER NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS.  IN MY OPINION THIS COMPONENT COULD POSSIBLY RESULT IN AN ENGINE FALLING OUT OF IT'S SEAT AND POSSIBLY CAUSE A CRASH.  *TR",
