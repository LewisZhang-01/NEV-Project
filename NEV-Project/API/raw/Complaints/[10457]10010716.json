UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, MY MECHANIC FOUND THE CONNECTION TO WHICH THE \"BULB\" WAS PLUGGED HAD MELTED SOME WHAT.  HE SUGGESTED THAT I RETURN TO THE DEALER TO ASK IF THERE WERE ANY RECALLS ON THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM, WHICH I INTEND TO DO TOMORROW.  2) BRAKE PEDAL:  RECENTLY I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO HAVE NEW BRAKE PADS INSTALLED.  PART OF THE PROBLEM (FOR ME) WAS THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS TOO SOFT AND TOO LOW (THE BRAKES WERE BAD ALSO).  THE REPAIRS WERE MADE BY AN EXTREMELY REPUTABLE MECHANIC.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE BRAKE PEDAL IS STILL TOO SOFT AND TOO LOW.            *JB",
