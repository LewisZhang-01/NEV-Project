I WENT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME THAT IT COULD BE THAT, BUT ALSO OFFERED AN IMPLAUSABLE EXPLANATION FOR A SCENARIO WERE SEPARATION FROM THE GLASS MIGHT HAVE OCCURRED. THEY REFUSE TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION OR EVEN INVESTIGATE IT. THE ALTERNATE SCENARIO WAS OFFERED BY A REGIONAL DEALER MANUFACTURER WHO HAS NEVER SEEN MY CAR AND WHO REFUSED TO INSPECT IT PERSONALLY WHEN I REQUESTED IT.*AK",
