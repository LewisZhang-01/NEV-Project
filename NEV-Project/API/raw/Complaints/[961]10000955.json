I FILE A COMPLAINT WITH GMC BECAUSE THE AIR BAG DID NOT ACTIVATE NOR DID THE SEAT BELT HOLD ME. THEY CHECKED THE DATA ON COMPUTER CHIP AND MY SPEED WAS ABOUT 15MPH. LATER A RECALL WAS ISSUE ON POSSIBLE PROBLEM WITH AIR BAG ACTIVATION. THEY SAID MY TRUCK DID NOT SHOW AN ERROR CODE TO SHOW IT MADE THE AIR BAG NOT ACTIVATE. I GOT THE RECALL TAKEN CARE OF THOUGH. IS THERE ANY LEGAL RECOURSE ON THIS? I JUST WANTED MEDICAL BILLS PAID. TS",
