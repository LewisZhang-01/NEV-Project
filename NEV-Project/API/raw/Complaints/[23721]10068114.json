NOW, JUST A MONTH LATER, MY WIFE TELLS ME THE INTREPID HAS STARTED MAKING A LOUD RATTLLING NOISE.  I WENT TO GO CHECK IT OUT AND COULDN'T GET THE CAR TO START.  I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A SERVICE STATION AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE ENGINE IS PROBABLY TOTALLED AND WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED.  I HAVEN'T HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALER YET AS I REALLY DON'T WANT TO SPEND ANOTHER $200 GETTING THE CAR TOWED THERE AND HAVING A DIAGNOSTIC TO FIND OUT WHAT I ALREADY KNOW.  DAIMLER CHRYSLER REALLY NEEDS TO DO RIGHT BY THEIR CARS.  I SPOKE WITH THEM AND THEY SAID I'D HAVE TO PROVIDE PROOF THAT I'VE BEEN HAVING THE OIL CHANGED EVERY 3000 MILES.  EVEN THEN, THEY SAID I'D HAVE TO PROVE THAT THE SERVICE STATION WAS REPUTABLE AND USED HIGH QUALITY OIL.  BASICALLY THEY SAID I WAS SCREWED.  THANKS DODGE.   *LA",
