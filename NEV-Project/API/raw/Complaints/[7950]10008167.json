        "summary": "THIS IS ABOUT A POTENTIAL SAFETY HAZARD AND A COUPLE OF NEAR ACCIDENTS.     I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT MY NEW MPV EXCEPT FOR THE INCREDIBLY POORLY DESIGNED STEERING COLUMN MOUNTED SHIFTER. IT IS UNNECESSARILY LONG AND INTERFERES WITH ACCESS TO AND VIEW OF THE CLIMATE AND AUDIO CONTROLS. I HAVE KNOCKED IT OUT OF GEAR MORE THAN ONCE (INCLUDING ONCE WHEN I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE STEEP DOWNHILL GRADE OF THE I-5 GRAPEVINE) REACHING TO TURN ON OR OFF THE RADIO, AND I HOPPED A SHOULDER ONCE ON THE FREEWAY WHEN TRYING TO LOOK AROUND IT TO FIND THE A/C BUTTON. MY HUSBAND ALSO KNOCKED THE SHIFTER INTO NEUTRAL WHEN REACHING TO TURN THE RADIO ON. THE PROBLEM IS THE BRACE ON MY RIGHT WRIST, WHICH I WEAR WHEN DRIVING DUE TO A RECENTLY BROKEN/SEVERELY SPRAINED WRIST . *JB    I ASKED THE DEALER'S SERVICE MANAGER IF THEY COULD REPLACE, SHORTEN OR BEND THE HANDLE AND HE REFUSED. (MY HUSBAND WOULD EVEN TRY TO BEND THE HANDLE, BUT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT DAMAGING THE SHIFTER AND/OR VOIDING THE WARRANTY)    I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR ACCIDENTS POSED BY THIS POORLY THOUGHT OUT LEVER (THE ONLY BAD DESIGN ON THIS WONDERFUL VAN). I HOPE THAT YOU CAN CONVINCE MAZDA TO CORRECT IT.",
