        "summary": "I PURCHASED A HYUNDAI SONATA LIMITED 2.0 TURBO AND TOOK DELIVERY ON MAY 27, 2011. DURING THE FOLLOWING WEEKEND, I NOTICED IT HAS A DISCERNIBLE PULLING-LEFT STEERING DEFECT AT ALL TIMES, WHICH BECOMES DRAMATICALLY MORE NOTICEABLE, AND DANGEROUS, AT SPEEDS ABOVE 50 MPH. I RETURNED THE CAR TO THE DEALER TO CORRECT THIS DEFECT ON JUNE 6, 2011 WITHOUT SUCCESS. A SECOND ATTEMPT BY THE DEALER TO CORRECT THIS DEFECT DURING THE WEEK OF JUNE 17-24, 2011 WAS ALSO UNSUCCESSFUL.  I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALER A THIRD TIME ON FRIDAY, JULY 8, 2011 AT THE REQUEST OF THE SERVICE MANAGER. HE DROVE THE CAR AND PRONOUNCED THAT THE DEALER HAD MADE ALL THE FACTORY ADJUSTMENTS IT CAN MAKE, THE CAR NOW MEETS ALL FACTORY SPECS, THIS MODEL HAS ?SENSITIVE? STEERING AND OUR CAR WILL NOT DRIVE DIFFERENTLY.  I CONTACTED HYUNDAI CONSUMER AFFAIRS AT 800-633-5151 ON MONDAY, JULY 18, 2011. I SPOKE WITH AN EMPLOYEE WHO ASSIGNED ME CASE # 4472765 AND ADVISED I WOULD BE CONTACTED BY A SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE.  THE REPRESENTATIVE CALLED, CONFIRMED ALL FACTS OF THE DEFECT AND SAID THE DEALER WILL CONTACT YOU FOR FURTHER ACTION. I RECEIVED NO CONTACT FROM THE DEALER OR THE SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE.  THE SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE REFUSED TO RETURN OUR CALLS ON 8/8/2011 AND 8/15/2011, SO I CONTACTED HYUNDAI CONSUMER AFFAIRS (AGAIN) AT 800-633-5151 ON WED, AUG 17, 2011. I SPOKE WITH AN EMPLOYEE ABOUT CASE # 4472765.  HE ADVISED THAT AS OF AUGUST 15, 2011, HYUNDAI HAD ISSUED A SONATA SERVICE CAMPAIGN (RECALL) # 927, AND I SHOULD CONTACT THE DEALER FOR AN APPOINTMENT TO REPAIR THE STEERING PROBLEM.  I CALLED THE DEALER AND WAS CONNECTED TO A SERVICE ADVISER, WHO LOOKED FOR SERVICE CAMPAIGN #927.  IT WAS NOT IN HER SYSTEM YET FOR OUR VEHICLE VIN#, BUT SHE FOUND INFORMATION IN HER SYSTEM THAT DESCRIBED 927.  SHE SAID SHE WOULD CHECK HER SYSTEM DAILY FOR UPDATES AND CALL ME WHEN IT WAS AVAILABLE.  8/29/2011: I'VE RECEIVED NO RECALL LETTER FROM HYUNDAI AND THE DEALER REFUSES TO ACT UNTIL HYUNDAI AUTHORIZES ACTION.  *TR",
