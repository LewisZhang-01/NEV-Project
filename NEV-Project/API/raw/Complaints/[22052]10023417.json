        "summary": "THE DODGE 2500 AND 3500 PICKUPS EQUIPPED WITH THE CUMMINS 24 VALVE DIESEL HAS A DEFECTIVE FUEL PUMP THAT CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE WITHOUT NOTICE. THE TRUCKS INVOLVED ARE '98.5 THROUGH '02 MODELS. THESE PUMPS LAST AS SHORT AS 30,000 MILES. DODGE KNOWS OF THIS PROBLEM AND HAS REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT. THIS CAN CAUSE A LOSS OF POWER UN-EXPECTEDLY AND CREATE SAFETY ISSUES. IT ALSO LEADS TO A MUCH MORE CONSUMER COSTLY FIX IN THAT IF IT ISN'T REPLACED IN TIME, THE INJECTION PUMP WILL FAIL DUE TO LACK OF FUEL FLOW. THE EXCESS FUEL FLOW THAT THE LIFT PUMP NORMALLY SUPPLIES IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COOLING AND LUBRICATING THE FUEL INJECTION PUMP. THE REPLACEMENT OF THE INJECTION PUMP CAN RUN $3,000. I HAD TO REPLACE MINE AT 40,000 MI AS DODGE WON'T REPLACE IT UNTIL IT FAILS OR HAS SO LOW OF PRESSURE. AS STATED ABOVE, LETTING THE LIFT PUMP COMPLETELY FAIL OR GET INTO THE LOW PRESSURE RANGE THAT DODGE WILL REPLACE IT, THE DAMAGE HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE TO THE INJECTION PUMP OR THE TRUCK WILL FAIL TO RUN OR QUIT UNEXPECTEDLY.   THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP YOU CAN GIVE US. SINCERELY [XXX].   *NLM    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
