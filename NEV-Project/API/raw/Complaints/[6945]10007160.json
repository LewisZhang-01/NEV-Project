I THEN QUICKLY REACTED AND PRESSED THE CLUTCH LEVER IN AND COASTED AND PULLED OVER TO THE SHOULDER. SINCE THAT INCIDENT THE BIKE DOESN'T SHIFT THE SAME AND THE CLUTCH WOULD ENGAGE WITH THE LEVER ALMOST ALL THE WAY OUT WHICH PRIOR TO THAT THE CLUTCH ENGAGE SOONER THEN THAT. I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE RIDING THE BIKE. I WILL BE CONTACTING KAWASAKI MANUFACTURER AND THE SHOP WHERE I PURCHASED THE BIKE.
