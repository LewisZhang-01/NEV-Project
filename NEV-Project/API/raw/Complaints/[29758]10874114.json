I DID SOME RESEARCH AND SAW THAT MULTIPLE PEOPLE WITH HONDA ACCORDS AND HONDA CIVICS HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM AND HONDA WAS NO HELP WITH FIXING THE ISSUE OR KNOWING WHAT IS WRONG. THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL AND SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS IF AN ACCIDENT HAPPENS BECAUSE THE AIRBAG WONT WORK. ALSO, THIS CREATES MOLD IN THE CAR AND WONT BE EASY FOR THE OWNER TO SELL THE CAR. PLEASE MAKE THIS A RECALL ON THE CARS. I HAVE A 2011 ACCORD COUPE V6. THEY WILL SAY MY CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY. I PURCHASED IT BRAND NEW AND WITHIN THE LAST YEAR THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON AND I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ANYTHING UNTIL I REALIZED IT WAS COMING THROUGH MY CAR WHEN IT RAINED OUTSIDE. PLEASE HELP!",
