        "summary": "I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH MY 97 JETTA SINCE I PURCHASED IT IN 1999.  IT BEGAN WITH THE TRANSMISSION IN 2000 WHEN THE CAR HAD ONLY 35,000 MILES.  THE DEALER IN NAPA REBUILT MY TRANSMISSION. EVER SINCE THEN, MY GEARS HAVE SEEMED UNUSUALLY STIFF AND TIGHT. ONLY 3 MONTHS LATER,  MY IGNITION FAILED AND THE DEALER IN NAPA REPLACED THAT. THIS PAST SUMMER (2002) I BEGAN HAVING PROBLEMS WITH ONE OF MY AUTOMATIC WINDOWS.  IT WAS GETTING STUCK AND LATER FELL INTO THE DOOR WHILE I WAS DRIVING.  I WAS ABLE TO RAISE IT WITH MUCH DIFFICULTY.  WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH TWO OF THE OTHER WINDOWS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND THEY REPLACE 3 OF THE 4 REGULATORS/LIFTS.  THIS COST ME QUITE A BIT OF MONEY AS THE WARRANTY ON THE CAR IS GONE.  OVER THIS CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY I BEGAN HAVING PROBLEMS WITH MY CLUTCH/GEAR BOX/ TRANSMISSION AGAIN.  I AM TAKING MY CAR TO THE DEALER TOMORROW FOR A DIAGNOSTIC CHECK (12/30/02).  NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN MY VW JETTA.  THIS IS THE FIRST CAR THAT I HAVE PURCHASED AND HOPED IT WOULD BE A GREAT STARTER.  I WILL NEVER BUY A VW AGAIN.   SCC    ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****770794",
