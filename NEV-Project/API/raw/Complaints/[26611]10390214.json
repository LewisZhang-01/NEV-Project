YOU CAN NOW LEAN BACK AND FRONT OF SEAT LIFTS UP.  VERY DANGEROUS.  IF THERE WAS A CRASH, YOU COULD EASILY END UP IN THE BACK SEAT OF THE CAR.  I HAVE LOOKED AND FOUND MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SITUATION WITH THE JEEPS, 1 SITE HAD OVER 2600 COMPLAINTS IN A 2 YEAR PERIOD.  I TOOK OFF THE SIDE OF THE SEAT AND ADDED 2 NYLON STRAPS TO HOLD SEAT DOWN TO RAIL.  I HAVE READ MANY PLACES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THIS WELDED BACK TOGETHER AND IT BREAKS AGAIN. METAL  IS VERY THIN, NOT BUILT TO TAKE STRAIN OF ANY KIND.  *TR",
