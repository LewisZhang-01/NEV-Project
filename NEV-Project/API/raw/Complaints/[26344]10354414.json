WHEN IT IS IN TEST MODE, I TEMPORARILY LOOSE CONTROL OF MY BRAKES AND STEERING!!!!! IT SEEMS MORE FREQUENT IN THAT IT HAS DONE IT TWICE IN THE PAST MONTH, TODAY BEING ONE OF THE TIMES. I ACTUALLY REAR ENDED SOMEONE TODAY BECAUSE MY BRAKES DID NOT WORK!!!!!! I THINK THE SYSTEM IS A GOOD IDEA BUT THE SELF TESTING CAUSING LOSS OF CONTROL IS DANGEROUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOW I HAVE A TICKET, A RECORD, 2 VEHICLES TO REPAIR AND PROBABLY AN INCREASE IN INSURANCE! GREAT VAN BUT THIS PART SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *TR",
