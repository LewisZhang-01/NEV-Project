I TOOK IT TO THE LOCAL DEALER AND LEARNED THE DRIVE SHAFT CENTER BEARING IS SHOT.  DEALER TOLD ME THE CAR SHOULD NOT BE DRIVEN AS THE DRIVE SHAFT COULD FALL AT ANY TIME CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO FLIP OR ROLL OVER.  IF THAT IS NOT BAD ENOUGH HE ALSO TOLD ME THE PART IS UNAVAILABLE AND IS ON NATIONAL BACK ORDER. WE'VE BEEN WAITING OVER A WEEK NOW AND THE DEALER IS SAYING HE DOESN'T SEE ANY CHANCE OF HAVING THE PART IN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO! I SEE ANOTHER SIMILAR COMPLAINT HERE AND ACCORDING TO THE SALES PERSON WHO SOLD THE CAR, THE PART HAS BEEN REDESIGNED BY GM DUE TO NUMEROUS PROBLEMS WITH IT. CLEARLY THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER TO DETERMINE IF GM IS  WORKING TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH AN APPROPRIATE SENSE OF URGENCY. *TR",
