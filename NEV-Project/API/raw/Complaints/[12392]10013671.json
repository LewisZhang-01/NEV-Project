CAR HAS BEEN TOWED IN SEVERAL TIMES AND DEALERSHIP CAN FIND NOTHING WRONG IT.  DEALERSHIP HAS REPLACED ALTERNATOR, TRANSMISSION, FUEL HOSES, SENSOR, COMPUTER, ETC. AND CAR STILL STALLS.  THIS WEEK IT HAD TO BE TOWED FROM MY GARAGE TO THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT START.  DEALERSHIP AGAIN COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH CAR. I LOVE THE CAR, BUT AM TERRIFIED TO DRIVE IT AS WHEN IT STALLS EVERYTHING LOCKS UP AND I HAVE HAD A COUPLE NEAR MISS ACCIDENTS TRYING TO GET OFF THE ROAD.  I HAVE AN INFANT AND THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.  *NLM",
