UPON RESEARCH I DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THE SATURN SKY AND PONTIAC SOLSTICE.  IT AFFECTS MULTIPLE YEARS AND GM HAS KNOWN ABOUT IT SINCE IT STARTED HAPPENING.  YET UPON REVIEW THERE HAS NOT BEEN A RECALL ISSUED FOR THIS PROBLEM.  THIS IS CLEARLY A SAFETY ISSUE IN REGARDS TO THE SAFETY OF THE PASSENGER IN A TWO SEAT CAR.  GM IS NOW ISSUING RECALLS FOR ALMOST EVERYTHING AND I HAVE READ MULTIPLE REPORTS TO YOUR ORGANIZATION IN REGARDS TO THE AIRBAG SENSOR PROBLEM, BUT GM DOES NOTHING.  WHEN IS THIS ISSUE GOING TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY?  I WISH I HAD THE STATISTICS ON HOW MANY HAVE BEEN INJURED OR KILLED DUE TO THIS FAILED SENSOR SO I COULD INCLUDE THAT.  *TR",
