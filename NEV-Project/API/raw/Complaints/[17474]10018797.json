THERE WERE NO HOLES OR BUMPS IN THE ROAD AND THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE GOOD.  APPROXIMATELY 7-10 MINUTES PREVIOUS TO THIS, WHILE ON THE FREEWAY, THE INSIDE LIGHT TURNED ON AND OFF, THE DOOR LOCKS WERE GOING UP AND DOWN AND THE CONTROL PANEL WENT BERSERK. IT STOPPED AS SUDDENLY AS IT STARTED. THIS HAD HAPPENED ONE TIME BEFORE AND THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  *NLM",
