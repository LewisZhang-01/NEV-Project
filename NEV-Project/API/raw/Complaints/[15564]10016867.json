HAVE TAKEN IT TO NUMEROUS CHRYSLER DEALERS WHO IN EACH INSTANCE STATE THAT THEY CANNOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. WE HAVE LOST AT A MINIMUM TWENTY DAYS OF TIME THAT THE CAR WAS IN THE SHOP FOR THIS COMPLAINT. THE MOST RECENT WAS VISIT (4/30-5/1/03) AND WERE TOLD THE PROBLEM WAS REPAIRED. NOT SO. THE FIRST TIME THE CAR WAS DRIVEN ON 5/1/03 THE LIGHT AGAIN CAME ON.  MY CONCERN IS WITH THE DEALER'S ADVISORY THAT THE AIR BAG IS NOT FUNCTIONING WHEN THE LIGHT IS ON AND THIS COULD RESULT IN A CATASTROPHIC INCIDENT.  THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN INSPECTED FOR THIS PROBLEM REPEATEDLY AT VERGER CHRYSLER IN COOS BAY, OREGON AND FISHER CHRYSLER IN YUMA, ARIZONA.",
