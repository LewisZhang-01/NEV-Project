I TOOK IT INTO THE INVER GROVE FORD, MN AND THE DIAGNOSIS WAS BROKEN WHEEL SENSOR AND HAD TO REPLACE THE ECU.  THAT COST US $1600.00.  THEN ON 12/8/02, THE 2 LIGHTS CAME ON AGAIN.  I CALLED FORD VERY UPSET AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE IS ONLY A 12 MONTH/12,000 MILES WARRANTY ON THE PART.  AFTER ANOTHER DIAGNOSTIC TEST, IT WAS DETERMINED THE ECU AGAIN WENT OUT.  FORD OFFERED TO PAY $500.00 OF THE $1147.00 ESTIMATE, BUT IT INFURIATES ME THAT AUTOMOBILE COMPANIES CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS TYPE OF \"HIGHWAY ROBBERY\" AND ONLY WARRANTY SUCH AN EXPENSIVE PIECE FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.  IT IS NOW A SAFETY ISSUE, BECAUSE MY ANTI-LOCK BRAKES DO NOT WORK!  WHAT AM I TO DO?",
