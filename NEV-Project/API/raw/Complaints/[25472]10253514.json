I HAVE TALKED TO SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. I WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE A RECALL SINCE IT IS FUEL RELATED AND A SERIOUS RISK. THE FUEL LEAKS FROM A RUBBER HOSE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ENGINE THAT CONNECTS TWO HARD GAS LINES. I TRIED TIGHTENING THE CLAMPS AND IT DID NOT HAVE MUCH AFFECT. THE HOUSE HAS NO HOLES OR TEARS IN IT. NEITHER DO THE HARD GAS LINES. SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT CANT HOLD THE PRESSURE OR WHAT? I NOTICED IT AFTER DRIVING FOR A FEW MILES. I STOPPED FOR A MINUTE AND GOT A STRONG GAS SMELL. THERE WAS GAS IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT WHEN I CHECKED IT WHEN I GOT HOME. I DROVE A TOTAL OF TEN MILES MAYBE. *TR",
