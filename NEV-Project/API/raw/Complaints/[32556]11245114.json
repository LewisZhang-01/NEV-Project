I NOW HAVE TO PUMP THE BRAKES TO GET THEM TO WORK. I GOT MY BRAKES FLUSHED AND THEY WENT BACK TO NORMAL. ABOUT A MONTH LATER THE SAME THING HAPPENED WHEN I HAD TO BRAKE HARD DUE TO ABRUPT STOP ON THE INTERSTATE. IT TOOK ABOUT A WEEK TO GET THEM BACK TO NORMAL. THIS IS NOT SAFE AND SHOULD NOT HAPPEN WITH NEW BRAKES AND ROTORS.",
