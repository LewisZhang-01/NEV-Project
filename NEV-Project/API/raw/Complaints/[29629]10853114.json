IT NEVER HAPPENS WITH MY WIFE WHO IS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THIS VEHICLE.  THIS BEGAN SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASE AND WAS MENTIONED TO OUR L/M DEALER (BEFORE THEY WENT OUT OF BUSINESS).  I JUST MADE THE CORRELATION WITH THE SPEED CONTROL LAST WEEKEND.  IN FACT, I CAN DUPLICATE THE ISSUE NOW.  THE SHUTOFF OCCURS DURING DECELERATION WHEN SPEED CONTROL IS ENGAGED AROUND 35 MPH.  SINCE MY WIFE ONLY USES SPEED CONTROL ON THE INTERSTATE, IT HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO HER.",
