ON SUNDAY APRIL 13 I WAS TRAVELING DOWN I-4 FROM TAMPA TO WINTER HAVEN FLORIDA AT APPROXIMATELY 70 MPH WHEN THE TRUCK STARTED SHAKING VIOLENTLY.  I PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THE RIGHT REAR TIRE HAD SEPARATED AND A LARGE PIECE OF THE TIRE HAD COME OFF.  I PUT ON THE SPARE AND DROVE HOME, CONTINENTAL TOLD ME TO GO TO TIRE KINGDOM WHICH WOULD NOT HELP ME.  I JUST ASK THAT WE HAVE SAFE TIRES ON OUR VEHICLES AND THIS TIRE COMPANY SEEMS TO DO EVERYTHING BUT TAKE THE BLAME FOR THE PROBLEM.*JB",
