        "summary": "1998 FORD TAURUS WOULD OCCASIONALLY NOT MOVE FROM A COMPLETE STOP.  THIS HAPPENED FOUR TIMES BETWEEN NOVEMBER 2002 AND THE PRESENT.  AFTER THE FOURTH TIME (MAY 2, 2003), THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP.  THEY STATED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $2800.  THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN INDEPENDENT TRANSMISSION SHOP FOR A SECOND OPINION.  THEY FOUND METAL SHAVINGS IN THE PAN AND BURNT MERCON V.  TOTAL COST FOR REBUILDING THE TRANSMISSION WAS $1400-$1800.  THIS IS A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE SINCE THE SHOP HAS TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGE INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION.  THE VEHICLE WAS NOT USED FOR TRAILER TOWING OR RACING.  ENGINE IS THE DURATEC V6 AND THE TOTAL MILEAGE IS 64077.  THIS IS TO ME A SERIOUS CONCERN SINCE A VEHICLE SHOULD LAST AT LEAST 100,000 MILES WITHOUT A MAJOR FAILURE AS WHAT HAS HAPPENED.  EVERY TIME THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT MOVE FROM A COMPLETE STOP WAS AT A CONGESTED INTERSECTION, AND ONE OF THE TIMES THIS OCCURRED WAS ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY WHERE THE MAXIMUM SPEED LIMIT IS 65 MPH.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN.   *NLM",
