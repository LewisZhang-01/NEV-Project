        "summary": "I PURCHASED MY 2000 ACURA INTEGRA NEW IN JAN 2000.  APPROX 2 WEEKS AGO, WITH NO WARNING, IT STOPPED CHANGING GEARS.  I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT I'M LUCKY I WAS NOT ON THE FREEWAY.  I HAD IT TOWED TO AN AUTO REPAIR SHOP LAST FRIDAY.  2 DAYS AGO THEY CALLED TO INFORM ME A BOLT HAD COME OFF INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION AND IT WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED.  THE TRANSMISSION NOT THE BOLT!!!  IT WOULD COST $2550.00 AND WOULD NOT BE READY UNTIL NEXT WEEK.  I INFORMED THEM I WANTED A DETAILED REPORT ON EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND ALL DAMAGED PARTS.  I HAVE HIGH MILEAGE ON MY AUTO (82,000) AND IT IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY.  I DON'T THINK IT IS REASONABLE FOR A BOLT TO FALL OFF AND DESTROY A RELATIVELY NEW TRANSMISSION.  THIS IS MY 2ND INTEGRA ... I PURCHASED MY 1ST NEW INTEGRA IN 1992 AND HAD IT 9 YEARS WITH 186,000 MI BEFORE I SOLD IT.  THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAD THE ENTIRE TIME I OWNED IT WAS REPLACING THE RADIATOR.  THIS IS THE REASON I PURCHASED THE 2ND ONE.  THERE MUST BE SOMETHING I CAN DO ABOUT THIS!!!  ANY SUGGESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.   *NLM",
