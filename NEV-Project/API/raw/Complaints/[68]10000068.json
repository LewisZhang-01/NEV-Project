I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR FOR ABOUT 5 MILES HOME.  THE CAR WAS PARKED IN THE GARAGE TO WAIT FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANY INSPECTOR TO COME FOR CLAIM INSPECTION.  HOWEVER AFTER ABOUT 3 FULL DAYS, THE CAR IGNITED ITSELF AND BURNED THE WHOLE CAR.  OF COURSE, I AM FORTUNATE THAT I WAS NOT IN THE CAR WHEN THE FIRE STARTED BUT IT IS QUITE UNRELIABLE FOR THE CAR TO JUST IGNITE BY ITSELF.  SHOULDN'T THERE SOME KIND OF SAFTY FEATURE FOR A SLIGHTLY CRASHED CAR TO BE SAFE FROM CATCHING A FIRE OR THIS SAFTY FEATURE SIMPLY MALFUNCTIONED???",
