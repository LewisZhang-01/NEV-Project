TRAVELING SOUTH ON EBENEZER ROAD, I ENGAGED THE CRUISE  CONTROL SETTING IT AT 45 MPH.  APPROACHING NORTH SHORE IN THE RIGHT  LANE, I SAW 4-6 CARS WAITING AT THE LIGHT.  I TAP THE BRAKE TO DISENGAGE THE CRUISE CONTROL AND IMMEDIATELY FELT THE VAN ACCELERATION.  I TURNED INTO THE LEFT LANE TO MISS THE CARS IN THE RIGHT LANE.  I REPOSITION MY FOOT BY LIFTING IT UP THINKING THAT I HAD PRESS BOTH THE ACCELERATOR AND BRAKE, AND PRESS IT BACK ON THE BRAKE.  THE VAN WAS STILL ACCELERATING AND I THOUGHT TO MYSELF WHY WAS IT STILL ACCELERATING?  BY THAT TIME, I WAS IN THE INTERSECTION AND HAD NO CONTROL.  I HIT A POLE AND GUARD RAIL ON THE FAR SIDE OF NORTH SHORE.  I DID NOT HIT ANY OTHER VEHICLE.  ALL OF THIS TOOK AROUND 10 SECONDS.  THE VAN WAS TOTALED!    ARE THERE OTHERS REPORTED WITH THIS PROBLEM WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL?  *TR",
