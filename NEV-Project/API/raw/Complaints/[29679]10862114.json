        "summary": "THE PROBLEM INITIALLY BEGAN BECAUSE I HAD TO BRAKE HARD TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT ON THE FREEWAY AND THE BRAKES FAILED. AFTER RESTARTING THE VEHICLE THE BRAKES WENT BACK TO NORMAL. A WEEK LATER AS I WAS DRIVING DOWN A STREET, I BRAKED NORMALLY TO PULL IN TO A BUSINESS PARKING LOT AND THE BRAKES FAILED ALMOST COMPLETELY. THE PEDAL WENT DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND WOULD NOT STOP THE VEHICLE IN A SAFE DISTANCE. ALSO, THEY HAD A SPONGY FEEL. THEY WOULD NOT PROPERLY GRIP UNTIL I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND THEN ON AGAIN. HAD THERE BEEN ANOTHER VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME I WOULD HAVE HIT THEM, OR IF THIS HAPPENED ON A LOCAL FREEWAY HERE IN HOUSTON, TX IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY FATAL. AFTER RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM, I LEARNED THAT MANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS HAVE HAD THE SAME EXACT ISSUE. THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE A FAULTY ABS MODULATOR.",
