I WAS TOLD THE STRUTS AND CV JOINTS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. FINE...IT WAS STILL UNDER MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY. AFTER A FEW MONTHS, ANOTHER SOUND FROM UNDERNEATH THE FRONT END. THIS TIME I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE STEERING COLUMN ASSEMBLY. THEY REPLACED THAT AGAIN UNDER WARRANTY. THEN ONE YEAR LATER I RETURNED DUE TO MORE NOISES COMING FROM THE FRONT END. THIS TIME...NO WARRANTY. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM IN THE STEERING BUT THEY WOULD COVER IT SINCE IT WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THESE CARS. ALSO THEY TOLD ME A TIE ROD END WAS ABOUT TO SNAP SO THEY REPLACED IT. I HAD TO PAY. NOW, ONLY A FEW MONTHS AFTER THAT, THE NOISE IN THE STEERING IS BACK AGAIN. WILL THIS EVER END?????  *TR",
