        "summary": "PURCHASED 2008 AUDI A4 NEW FROM DEALERSHIP IN OCTOBER 2007. TWO MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE, NOTICE OIL CONSUMPTION PROBLEM AT 1QT EVERY 1,000 MILES.  DEALERSHIP SAYS THIS IS NORMAL BUT MY MECHANIC SAID IT IS NOT.  WITH THE HELP OF A PRO-BONO ATTORNEY, CONTACTED AUDI AND DEMANDED REPAIR AT 12,000 MILES.  AUDI REPLACED RINGS AND CAR WAS FINE FOR 24,000 MILES.  AT 36,000 MILES, LOW OIL LIGHT CAME ON - 1 QT LOW AGAIN.  HAD OIL CHANGED BY MY MECHANIC AND TWO DAYS LATER A NEW PROBLEM - LOW OIL PRESSURE LIGHT COMES ON.  HAD CAR TOWED TO DEALERSHIP AND THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH CAR (NO CODES, DRIVES FINE).  I DEMAND THROUGH AUDI AN OIL PRESSURE TEST.  TEST CAME BACK NORMAL.  THEY TOLD ME TO DRIVE THE CAR AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.  THE LOW OIL PRESSURE LIGHT IS STILL COMING ON EVERY 20 MINUTES OF DRIVING.  THE CAR GOES BACK IN THE SHOP AGAIN THIS WEEK.  CAR IS OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE AND I AM CONCERNED ABOUT MAJOR ENGINE DAMAGE. *TR",
