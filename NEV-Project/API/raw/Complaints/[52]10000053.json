I TOOK THE CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY RAN A DIAGNOSTIC TEST ON THE CAR AND IT INDICATE THAT THE \" DIAGNOSTIC TEST DTL FOR THE TORQUE CONVERTOR CLUTCH CIRCUIT FAILURE INTFRMAL, RECOMMEND O/H TRANSMISSION.\"  I WAS ADVISED OF THE PROBLEM.  MY ISSUE IS THAT THE CAR IS A 2000 MODEL AND HAS 44,500 MILES ON IT AND THE CAR HAS A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM ALREADY.  THERE IS NO NOISE OR FEELING OF THE ACCELERATION OR CHANGE OF GEAR PROBLEMS.  WHY HAVE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS THIS EARLY IN THE CAR LIFE.",
