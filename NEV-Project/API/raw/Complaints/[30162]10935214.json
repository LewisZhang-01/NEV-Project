I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE ENGINE MAKING NOISE DUE TO BALANCE SHAFT CHAIN SPECIAL COVERAGE RECALL 12313 WHERE BACK THEN THEY INCLUDED IN THE RECALL THE BALANCE SHAFT CHAIN, TENSIONER, AND ALSO THE ENGINE MOUNT HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP, THEN TO SAY THIS BULLETIN HAS BEEN REVISED TO REMOVE SPECIAL COVERAGE ADJUSTMENT FOR THE FUEL PUMP THAT IS NOW INCLUDED IN VOLUNTARY EMISSIONS RECALL 43180. UPDATES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE PART INFORMATION, SERVICE PROCEDURE, AND WARRANTY TRANSACTION INFORMATION SECTIONS. PLEASE DISCARD ALL COPIES OF BULLETIN 12313B. CAME THE REVISED 12313B AND NOW AS OF SEPTEMBER 2016  REVISED AGAIN TO 12313C.   WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 43180 IT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE 2011 BUICK LACROSSE WITH THE SAME ENGINE RPO LAF. I'VE CALLED GM VARIOUS TIMES AND SPOKE EVEN TO THE GM DEALER, MY CAR WAS EVEN AT THE DEALER SITTING THERE FOR WEEKS TO ONLY SAY IT'S NOT COVERED THAT I HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT TO GET RECALLED. MY VEHICLE HAS THE SAME EXACT SYMPTOMS, THE OIL SMELLS LIKE GAS, AND I CAN'T SHUT OFF THE VEHICLE, IT STAYS RUNNING AND THE ONLY WAY TO SHUT IT OFF IS PUTTING IT ON DRIVE THEN SHUTTING IT OFF.  ALL THIS DUE TO ON SOME 2010-2011 MODEL YEAR BUICK LACROSSE, CHEVROLET EQUINOX, AND GMC TERRAIN; AND 2011 MODEL YEAR BUICK REGAL VEHICLES, EQUIPPED WITH A 2.4L ENGINE (LAF), THE CHROME LAYER ON THE BALANCE CHAIN PINS MAY WEAR, ALLOWING THE CHAIN TO STRETCH. THIS WOULD CAUSE AN ENGINE NOISE, AND IF LEFT UNTREATED, COULD CAUSE THE CHAIN TO BREAK, LEADING TO ENGINE DAMAGE.  THIS IS CAUSING THE ENGINE TO NOT RUN RIGHT AND A HARD TIME TO ACCELERATE  GM CASE #  8-2573359821",
