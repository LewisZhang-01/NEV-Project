I'VE GOTTEN RAIN DAMAGE BECAUSE MY WINDOWS AND ROOF ENDED UP OPEN DURING A MAJOR RAINSTORM.  THE \"VENTING' FEATURE OF THE CAR APPARENTLY WAS ACTIVATED WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE.  I HAVE SINCE LEARNED (IN DISCOVERING SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ONLINE) THAT THIS IS A KNOWN AND COMMON PROBLEM.  IT REPRESENTS A DEFECT IN THE DESIGN OF THE REMOTE KEY FOB.  MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO DISABLE THIS.  THIS OCCURRED BOTH TIMES WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONERY, SOMETIME AFTER EXITING THE VEHICLE.",
