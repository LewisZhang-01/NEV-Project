APPROXIMATELY A PINT OF GASOLINE COMES SQUIRTING OUT, DOUSING THE HANDLE, SIDE OF THE VEHICLE AND LEAVING A PUDDLE OF GASOLINE ON THE GROUND.  THE ONLY WAY FOR THIS TO NOT HAPPEN IS TO PREVENT FILLING THE CAR GAS TANK.  I.E. ONE CANNOT LET THE GAS OVERFLOW MECHANISM DETERMINE WHEN IT IS FULL.  A RECALL WAS ALREADY MADE FOR THE 2005 DURANGO UNDER RECALL ID# 05V034000.  MY USED 2006 VEHICLE HAS THE SAME PROBLEM.       *JS",
