THE CHRYSLER CORP  ASSISTED ON THE REPAIRS 2  HOWEVER WE NOW HAVE A 3RD VEHICLE THAT HAS 71543 MILES ON IT AND THE CHRYSLER CORP IS REFUSING TO OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE IN THE REPAIR.  IF THIS WAS ONLY ON 1 OF THEM I WOULD UNDERSTAND BUT THIS IS A PERSISTENT PROBLEM.   THERE WERE ENOUGH PROBLEMS THAT AMERICAN LAFRANCE AMBULANCE CONVERSION STOPPED MAKING THEM INTO  AMBULANCES  DUE TO THE PROBLEMS. *JB",
