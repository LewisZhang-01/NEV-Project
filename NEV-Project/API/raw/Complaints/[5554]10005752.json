TROUBLE STARTED AT APPROXIMATELY 18,000 MILES AND WAS NOT SOMEWHAT RESOLVED FOR NEARLY 10,000 MILES.    WHILE TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND STRIKING A BUMP WITH THE DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT WHEEL, THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE WOULD SHAKE VIOLENTLY AND START TO LEAVE THE LANE OF TRAVEL.  THE SHAKING AND SHUTTERING OF THE FRONT END GAVE A FEELING LIKE THE LEFT FRONT TIRE WAS EITHER BOUNCING DOWN THE ROAD OR WOBBELING.    THIS WAS REPORTED SEVERAL TIMES TO THE DEALER AND A CONTOL ARM AND STEERING ARM WAS REPLACED AT DIFFERENT ATTEMPTS TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  DURING THIS TIME FRAME, I EXPIERENCED EXCESSIVE WEAR ON THE TIRES.      A FRONT END ALIGNMENT HAS SEEMED TO REDUCE THE PROBLEM, BUT IT WOULD SEEM THAT IF THIS WAS THE SYMPTOM OF THE NEED FOR ALIGNMENT, THEN THE SERVICE CENTER WOULD HAVE KNOW THIS.",
