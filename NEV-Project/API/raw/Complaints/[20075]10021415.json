DRIVING ALONG AT 45 TO 50 MILES AN HOUR AND TRANSMISSION LOSES 2ND AND THROWS/SNAPS PASSENGERS FORWARD.  VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN OFF ROAD, ALL MILES ARE HIGHWAY.  VEHICLE HAS NOT PULLED ANYTHING. FORD SAID THEY COULD NOT REPAIR ONLY REPLACE TRANSMISSION WITH A REBUILT TRANSMISSION FOR $3100. I HAD A LOCAL TRANSMISSION REPAIR SHOP MAKE REPAIRS FOR $2200.  THEY WERE  TOLD BY FORD WHEN ORDERING PARTS THAT THE ONE-WAY CLUTCH THAT FAILED WAS A NEW DESIGN IN 1998. PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE SINCE FORD HAD SINCE GONE BACK TO PRE 1998 DESIGN. THIS IS CLEARLY A \"LATENT DEFECT\" THAT FORD IS/HAS BEEN AWARD OF. I AM ASKING FORD TO STAND FOR THE COST OF REPAIRS OR WILL REFER TO COUNSEL TO FILE A DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICE CLAIM AGAINST THEM.*AK",
