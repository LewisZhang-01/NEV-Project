HONDA AND THE DEALER HAVE FIXED IT 4 TIMES FOR FREE BUT NOW REFUSE TO FIX IT SAYING THAT SINCE THE VEHICLE IS OVER 100,000 MIKES, THEY NEED TO DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE.    I BELIEVE THIS TO BE A SAFETY HAZARD SINCE I DO NOT HAVE THE 3RD BRAKE LIGHT AND THIS COMES FLYING OFF WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY STRIKING OTHER CARS. *TR",
