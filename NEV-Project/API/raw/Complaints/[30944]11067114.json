        "summary": "WHEN THE CAR ENCOUNTERS A HILL AND NEEDS TO DOWNSHIFT, EITHER TO CLIMB OR TO HOLD BACK THE SPEED WHEN IT DESCENDS, THE CRUISE CONTROL REMEMBERS THE DOWNSHIFT AND WILL NOT RETURN TO HIGH GEAR UNTIL  A) IT IS MANUALLY OVERRIDDEN, BUT WILL STILL DOWNSHIFT UP TO 2 GEARS, WHEN THE LEVER IS PLACED BACK TO AUTOMATIC    OR, B) WHEN THE CRUISE CONTROL IS TURNED OFF.  THE CRUISE CONTROL ALSO BELATEDLY REACTS TO LOSS OF SPEED CONTROL AND OVERCORRECTS WITH TOO MUCH POWER, RESULTING IN A CRUDE RIDE, AS WELL.  THE WORKLOAD IS INCREASED DEALING WITH GETTING THE CAR TO ATTAIN TOP GEAR ON FLAT ROADS, AND IS CREATING UNSAFE CONDITIONS, IN MY OPINION.  I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO GET THIS ATTENDED TO AT THE DEALERSHIP, AND THEY CONTINUE TO NOT FIX THE ISSUE, AS WELL AS INFORM ME I SHOULDN'T BE USING CRUISE CONTROL ON HILLS.  MY 2014 KIA OPTIMA DID NOT EXHIBIT THESE ISSUES, NOR ANY OTHER OF MY CARS WHICH HAD CRUISE CONTROL.  THERE IS A PROBLEM AND THESE PEOPLE WILL NOT FIX IT.    THE CONSUMER STATED THE HEAT DOES ENTER THE FOOT WELL AREA. *JS",
