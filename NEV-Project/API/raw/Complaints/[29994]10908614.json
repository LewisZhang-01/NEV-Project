        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING ON SEPTEMBER 219TH, 2016, THE AIRBAG INDICATOR LIGHT STARTED FLASHING FOR UNDER A MINUTE, AND THEN THE ENTIRE DASHBOARD CLUSTER PANEL WENT OUT.  THE TACHOMETER, SPEEDOMETER, GAS GAUGE, DRIVER SAFETY INFORMATION, LIGHTING AND BREAKS , GEAR MODE, SEAT BELT INDICATOR, ENGINE TEMPERATURE GAUGE ALL WENT BLANK AS THE CAR WAS DRIVING STRAIGHT DOWN A STREET APPROXIMATELY 45 MILES AN HOUR.  I PULLED THE CAR OFF OF THE ROAD TO A SAFE PLACE.  SHUT IT DOWN, AND STARTED IT AGAIN NORMALLY.  THE ENTIRE INSTRUMENT PANEL HAS YET TO COME BACK ON.  I WAS ABLE TO GET THE SUV HOME, AND CALLED SOME LOCAL DEALERSHIPS TO GET IT IN TO SERVICE.  WHILE WAITING FOR A CALL BACK, I WAS ABLE TO RESEARCH, AND FOUND THAT THE VEHICLE IS UNDER TWO RECALLS, 16V-244 FOR OCCS SYSTEM, AND 16V-380 FOR STOP LAMP SWITCH..    I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR TO ROYAL NISSAN IN BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA (225) 924-0400 ON THE 20TH OF SEPTEMBER, 2016.  I INFORMED THEM OF THE RECALLS, AND THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD LOOK INTO THE MATER.  ON THE SEPTEMBER 21TH,  SERVICE ADVISOR  (KENNEY) CALLED ME AND SAID THAT THEY DID NOT YET KNOW HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM, BUT THE CAR WAS THREE YEARS OLD, AND OUT OF WARRANTY AND I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS MYSELF BECAUSE THEY WERE PROBABLY NOT RELATED TO THE RECALLS.  THAT IS WHERE IT STANDS.AS OF SEPTEMBER 21ST, 2016.  I DO NOT THINK THAT I AM BEING UNREASONABLE WHEN I THINK THAT THERE IS A CONNECTION TO THE FLASHING INDICATOR LIGHTS, AND THE DASHBOARD GOING OUT AT THE SAME TIME.",
