        "summary": "ON 02/02/03, I NOTICED A LARGE PIECE OF MY HOOD WAS EXPOSED DUE TO PEELING PAINT.  (THE GRAY METAL OF THE CAR'S STRUCTURE IS EXPOSED)  THE CAR IS A 1996 BUICK REGAL PURCHASED IN 12/99.  I AM CONCERNED THAT THE AREAS SURROUNDING THE PEELING PAINT WILL CONTINUE TO PEEL AWAY RESULTING IN NO WHITE PAINT ON THE HOOD.  UPON RESEARCHING HOW TO REPAIR THIS, I CAME UPON INFORMATION THAT GM HAD/IS HAVING A CONCEALED, LATENT MANUFACTURING DEFECT. (THE PHOTOS I VIEWED SHOWED THAT I AM HEADING TO BECOMING ANOTHER VICTIM TO GM'S PAINT PROBLEMS) I CONTACTED BUICK CORPORATION AND WAS TOLD THAT THE WARRANTY FOR THE REPAIRS HAD EXPIRED.  I BROUGHT TO THEIR ATTENTION THE DISCOVERY RULE AND THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO KNOW OF GM'S LATENT DPAINT DEFECT UNTIL THE PAINT LITERALLY STARTED PEELING OFF OF MY VEHICLE.  AND I STILL WAS NOT AWARE OF A PROBLEM UNTIL I CONDUCTED A SEARCH ENGINE ON THE INTERNET.  APPARENTLY A STORY WAS DONE BY DATELINE NBC IN 11/97 ABOUT THE ISSUE.  (ONCE AGAIN, MY CAR WAS PURCHASE 12/99)  THE REPRESENTATIVE REPEATED THAT THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED AND ENDED THE CONVERSATION.  I AM ANGRY BECAUSE I AM ABOUT TO MAKE MY FINAL CAR PAYMENT AND THIS ISSUE WAS NEVER BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION.  DO I HAVE ANY RECOURSE?",
