        "summary": "SAGGING OF REAR SUSPENSION.  THE FIRST TIME I NOTICED THIS PROBLEM WAS WHEN I TOOK THE FAMILY ON A SKI TRIP 2 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE.  ANYTIME AFTER THAT  I GO ON A TRIP, WITH 200 LBS WORTH OF WEIGHT FOR THE THREE REAR PASSENGERS AND THREE SUITCASES THAT BARELY WEIGHT ANOTHER 200 LBS.  THIS SO CALLED FAMILY CAR WHICH I PURCHASED FOR SAFE TRAVELING WITH MY FAMILY AND WHICH IS ADVERTISED AS A SAFE FAMILY CAR IS A MISNOMER.  REASON:  THE REAR SUSPENSION IMMEDIATELY SAGS LOW WITH THE WEIGHT I MENTIONED.  I'VE TAKEN IT TO TWO DEALERS THREE TIMES AND THE SERVICE ADVISORS STATES THE REAR SUSPENSION IS NORMAL.  I'VE DRIVEN AND OWNED MANY CARS BEFORE AND I NEVER HAD  SUCH A PROBLEM (ALTHOUGH I HAD SEEN THAT PROBLEM IN THE OLD K CARS WITH CHRYSLER.)   POINT: IN AN EMERGENCY MANEUVER I BELIEVE IT WOULD BECOME A DANGEROUS SITUATION WITH THIS CONDITION .  THE CAR DRIVES UNSTABLE,  TAKES BUMPS REALLY BAD,  AND IN SLIGHT HIGHWAY TURNS OVER 45 MPH, THE CAR IS HARD TO CONTROL; ALL DUE TO THIS EXTRA WEIGHT.  PLEASE ADVISE ME.          *TT",
