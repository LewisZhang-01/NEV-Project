        "summary": "NO ACCIDENTS YET, MY ABS LIGHT AND BRAKE LIGHT COME ON WITHIN THE FIRST MILE EVERYDAY I USE MY WINDSTAR AND THE ABS ACTIVATES AND OFTEN MY 2001 FORD WINDSTAR HAS AN UGLY NOISE AND THE BRAKE PEDAL PULSATES AND THE CAR DOES NOT WANT TO STOP, JUST LIKE IT WOULD IN AN ANTI-SKID SITUATION. I HAVE REPLACED FRONT BRAKES, ROTORS, CALIPERS, RF WHEEL SENSOR (PURCHASE ABS CODE READER AND STILL GET RF SENSOR CODES). RECENTLY I TOOK MY WINDSTAR TO FORD AND REPLACED THE BRAKE-CRUISE CONTROL RECALL. I QUESTIONED MY DEALER ABOUT THE ABS AND THEY HAVE NO CLUE ALMOST LIKE I NEEDED TO LEAVE IT AND THEY WOULD CHECK IT OUT AND TRY TO LOCATE THE CAUSE. I DO NOT WANT ANYONE TO START REPLACING PARTS THAT I HAVE REPLACED ESPECIALLY THE ONES I REPLACE MORE THEN ONCE. I HEAR ALOT OF TALK ABOUT A CONTROL MODULE BEING BAD SO I THINK IF THAT IS THE REMEDY IT SHOULD BE REPLACED AT NO CHARGE BY FORD AND I WON'T DEMAND THEY REIMBURSE TO ME THE MONEY I HAVE ALREADY SPENT TO REMEDY THIS PROBLEM. I LIKE THIS VEHICLE BUT WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS ABS PROBLEM FIXED OR DISABLE THE ABS. ALSO, ANOTHER OPTION FOR FORD IN MY CASE WOULD BE TO DISABLE THE ABS SO I DON'T GET THAT ANTI-SKID IN MY BRAKES ON A DRY DAY AND ALL WHEELS ARE ROLLING. ITS PRETTY UNNERVING WHEN YOUR CAR IS NOT IN A SKID CONDITION THE ABS TAKES OVER AND YOU ARE PANICKING TO GET THIS CAR TO STOP. I UNDERSTAND THIS ABS IS AN OPTION AND SINCE I DID NOT BUY THE CAR NEW I WOULD STRONGLY CONSIDER JUST DISABLING THE ABS SYSTEM BRAKES SO THEY WOULD WORK LIKE THE OLD FASHION BRAKES THAT SKIDDED IF YOU APPLIED ENOUGH PRESSURE... *TR",
