WHEN ONLY ONE HEADLIGHT GOES OUT, TURNING THE HEADLIGHT SWITCH OFF THEN BACK ON WILL RE-IGNITE THE HEADLIGHT.  WHEN BOTH HEADLIGHTS GO OUT, THEY WILL NOT COME BACK ON BY TURNING THE SWITCH OFF AND ON.  IT TAKES 4 OR 5 ATTEMPTS AT SWITCHING OFF/ON BEFORE THEY COME BACK ON.  I MUST DRIVE AT NIGHT TIME, AND THIS PROBLEM CAUSES ME TO BE PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS SUDDENLY WHILE DRIVING (A VERY DANGEROUS AND FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE).    THE DEALER DID NOT KNOW THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM, BUT WAS VERY WILLING TO SELL ME 2 HEADLIGHT BULBS FOR $790.00 AND IF THAT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM, COME BACK AND BUY 2 CONTROL UNITS FOR $950.00.    *TR",
