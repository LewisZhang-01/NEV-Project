ABOUT 1 WEEK LATER (AROUND MAY 5) AT A STOP LIGHT A LARGE ALLEN TYPE BOLT FELL AND ROLLED TO MY FEET. THIS BOLT WAS TO MY LAP SEAT BELT WHICH I WAS NOW HOLDING IN MY HAND! THE BOLT WAS NEVER TIGHTENED PROPERLY AND I HAD BEEN DRIVING LIKE THIS FOR AROUND 1 WEEK ASSUMING MY SEAT BELT WOULD WORK WHEN NEEDED. BMW OF PEORIA WAS INFORMED OF THIS THE SAME DAY, IT WAS FIXED BY THE NEXT DAY. I WROTE TO BMW-USA ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THE RESPONSE WAS VERY LOW KEY. MOSTLY THAT THEY APOLOGIZE  FOR THE INCONVENIENCE AND TO TALK WITH MY SERVICE MANAGER TO GET THIS ISSUE FIXED. I DON'T THINK THEY EVEN READ THE LETTER WHICH MENTIONED REMINDING BMW SERVICE OF PROPER WORK. JUST WRITING IN HOPES THAT NO ONE ELSE RUNS INTO THIS LIFE THREATENING SITUATION.   *NLM",
