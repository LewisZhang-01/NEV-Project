AFTER REACHING ABOUT 10 MPH THE CAR STALLED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET. FORTUNATELY, DUE TO THE TIME OF DAY THERE WAS NOT MUCH TRAFFIC AND I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY COAST TO THE SIDE OF THE STREET. I REPORTED THE ISSUE TO MY LOCAL VW DEALER AND INQUIRED IF THE ISSUE WAS RELATED TO VW SERVICE BULLETIN \"??FROZEN CHARGE AIR COOLER\"?? DATED 9/6/2011. DURING A SUBSEQUENT VISIT FOR AN UNRELATED REPAIR THE DEALER TECHNICIAN EXPERIENCED THE SAME ISSUES. THE TECHNICIAN DETERMINED THAT THE SERVICE BULLETIN WAS APPLICABLE AND ATTEMPTED TO ORDER THE REPAIR KIT. THE SERVICE ADVISOR INFORMED ME THAT VW AGREED THAT I WAS EXPERIENCING THE SYMPTOMS RELATED TO THE SERVICE BULLETIN, BUT THE RECOMMENDED REPAIR HAS PROVEN INEFFECTIVE AND THEY WOULD NOT INSTALL THE KIT. I WAS INFORMED THAT VW HAS, AS YET, NO PERMANANT SOLUTION AND THAT THE TEMPORARY SOLUTION IS TO ALLOW THE \"??CHARGE AIR COOLER\"?? TO THAW AND DRY OUT ANY REMAINING WATER. I HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT THE SITUATION IS LIKELY REOCCUR. IF THIS ISSUE HAPPENS IN HEAVY TRAFFIC I WOULD BE LIKELY BE UNABLE TO MOVE OUT OF DANGER SAFELY.  *TR",
