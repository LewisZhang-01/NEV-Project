SHE FELT NO RESISTANCE TO THE STEERING WHEEL AS SHE TRIED TO STOP THE SWERVING.  AT NO TIME DID SHE APPLY THE BRAKES.  WITNESSES SAID IT APPEARED SHE HAD A FLAT TIRE.  EVENTUALLY, THE VEHICLE ENTERED THE GRASS MEDIAN AND ROLLED 2.5 OR 3.5 TIMES COMING TO REST ON THE ROOF FACING ON-COMING TRAFFIC.  THE COMPLETE REAR END(TIRES AND DIFFERENTIAL) SEPARATED AND ENDED UP APPROX. 75 FEET FROM THE VEHICLE.  THE RIGHT FRONT AXLE OR CV JOINT WAS BROKEN.  NEITHER HER PASSENGER OR HER AIR BAGS DEPLOYED.  THE DRIVER'S SEAT BELT WAS BROKEN AT THE END OF THE MOTION OF THE ROLLING.  BOTH OCCUPANTS WERE BRUISED AND CUT.  WE BELIEVE THE AXLE FAILED AND CAUSED THIS POTENTIALLY FATAL ACCIDENT.  THIS VEHICLE HAD APPROX. 3000 MILES ON IT.  AT 1800 MILES THE ENGINE HAD THROWN A ROD AND THE ENGINE WAS REPLACED COMPLETELY.  THE JEEP LIBERTY IS STRUCTURALLY UNSOUND AND OF POOR DESIGN PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF THE REAR SUSPENSION.   DAIMLER-CHYSLER HAS LOWERED THE SUSPENSION IN OBVIOUS RESPONSE TO ROLL OVER INCIDENTS.*JB..*AK",
