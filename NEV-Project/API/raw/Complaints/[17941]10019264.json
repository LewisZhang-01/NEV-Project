THE CRASH TOTALLY PUSHED THE FRONT END OF THE CAR UP TOWARDS THE WINDSHIELD.  NEITHER AIR BAG CAME OUT AND I HAD MY SEAT BELT ON.  I CAN'T REMEMBER THE WRECK OR WHAT CAUSE ME TO LOSE CONTROL OF MY CAR.  FIGHT FOR LIFE HAD TO FLY ME OUT AND MY JAW WAS COMPLETELY SHATTERED. I ALSO HAD NO BRUISING OR INJURIES FROM MY SEAT BELT. I DON'T BELIEVE MY SEAT BELT RESTRAINED ME EITHER.  *NLM",
