        "summary": "MY CAR GIVES OFF A STRONG GAS/FUEL SMELL, WHICH IS NOT COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD, BUT CAN BE SMELLED BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CAR.  IT HAS ABOUT 74,000 MILES ON IT, AND IS LESS THAN 8 YEARS OLD.  I NOTICED THE SMELL NOW FOR MANY MONTHS, WHICH CONTINUES TO GET STRONGER.  I SAW THAT THERE IS A RECALL FOR THE CARS IN ARIZONA AND NEVADA, BUT I LIVE IN FLORIDA, WHERE IT CAN GET PRETTY HOT AS WELL.  I BELIEVE THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE FUEL PUMP.  THIS PROBLEM MUST BE HAPPENING QUITE OFTEN WITH OTHER VOLVO S60S.  THE PROBLEM MAY STEM FROM A POORLY DESIGNED PLASTIC PUMP HOUSING.  I TOOK THE CAR IN FOR THE VOLVO ETM WARRANTY PROGRAM ON 08/15/07 THINKING THAT THE FUEL SMELL WOULD BE CORRECTED WHEN THEY FIXED THE EMISSION SYSTEM PROBLEM.  THE DEALER'S RECEIPT INDICATES THEY PERFORMED A FUEL INDUCTION SERVICE BECAUSE OF THROTLE BODY DIRT, BUT THE FUEL SMELL HAS ONLY GOTTEN WORSE.  I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO SPEND $$$ TO HAVE IT REPAIRED, WHEN IT IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT.  WHAT CAN I DO?*CN",
