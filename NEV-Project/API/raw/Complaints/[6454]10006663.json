        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING TO WORK ON HIGHWAY 302 WHEN SUDDENLY THE SPEEDOMETER NEEDLE MOVED TO ZERO, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, THEN THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTED TO FIRST GEAR LOCKING THE WHEELS ALMOST CAUSING A WRECK, ALL OF THIS HAPPENED WITHIN TWO TO THREE SECONDS NOT MUCH TIME TO SLOW DOWN.  DODGE/CHRYSLER WOULDN'T COVER THE COST SINCE I BOUGHT A PROGRAM CAR AS IS NO WARRANTY, BUT BEFORE I PURCHASED IT, THEY DID A BUMPER TO BUMPER CHECK AND STATED EVERYTHING CHECKED OUT, THE VERY NEXT DAY AFTER I PURCHASED THE CAR, THE REAR POWER WINDOWS FAILED, A YEAR LATER I HAD A FLAT AND THE COMPACT SPARE THEY PUT IN THE TRUNK WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR DIDN'T MATCH THE BOLT PATTERN,  ON 12/26/02 THE PIN IN THE DIFFERENTIAL OF THE TRANSAXLE CAME LOOSE AND DESTROYED THE TRANSMISSION AND WILL COST $2,600.00 TO REPLACE.  CHRYSLER SURELY OUT DID THEMSELVES WITH THIS LEMON AND LUCKILY FOR ME I AVOIDED TWO MAJOR ACCIDENTS, AND 15  TRANSMISSION SHOPS STATED THIS IS THE MOST COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS MAKE.  I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE NOT MADE CHRYSLER RECALL THE DEFECTIVE SPEED SENSOR AND DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION WHICH CAN CAUSE A DEVASTATING WRECK WITHOUT WARNING.
