I DRIVE LOCALLY, AROUND TOWN, DON'T EVEN DRIVE/GO OUT SOMETIMES 1 OR 2 DAYS WKLY; I DON'T KNOW HOW/WHY THE EXCESSIVE MILEAGE IS DISPLAYED.  PERHAPS FOR EVERY MILE DRIVEN, SEVERAL MORE ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTER?  THE DEALER CHECKED ON THEIR COMPUTER SYSTEM, AND SUPPOSEDLY THE  THEIR SYSTEMS MATCH .  SINCE JAN. 2016, I FIGURED TO HAVE DRIVEN, APPROX. 1000 MILES.  I AM CONCERNED FURTHERMORE, BECAUSE I PURCHASED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THIS CAR, AND I DON'T WANT INACCURATE MILEAGE TO VOID THE WARRANTY'S  STIPULATION.  IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER OCCURANCES, WITH OTHER OWNER'S OF THIS CAR TYPE, PLEASE REPORT IT AND HAVE YOUR MECHANIC CHECK IT OUT.",
