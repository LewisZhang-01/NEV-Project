THE CAR TRAVELED APPROX 40 FEET BACKING INTO A DITCH WHICH AT THAT TIME IT STOPPED POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF THE SUDDEN ABRUPT DITCH. I HER FATHER WAS WATCHING AND ASKED \"WHAT DID YOU DO\" SHE STATED \"NOTHING IT JUST TOOK OFF\"  THIS WAS A YEAR BEFORE I HEARD OF THE TOYOTA PROBLEMS SO I JUST SHRUGGED IT OFF AS A WEIRD INCIDENT.
