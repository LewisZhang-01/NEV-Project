I HAD TO IMMEDIATELY MOVE TO THE RIGHT MOST SHOULDER ON THE INTERSTATE (WHICH I WAS ABLE TO AS CAR WAS STILL ON WITH ENGINE RUNNING). ONCE, I MOVED TO THE SHOULDER, I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND RESTARTED THE CAR WITH CHECK ENGINE LIGHT. IT WOULD TURN ON FINE BUT WOULDN'T MOVE AND IMMEDIATELY IT THROWS UP THE ERROR. I HAVE ATTACHED THE PICS FOR REFERENCE. SINCE CAR DIDN'T TURN OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF HIGHWAY, I WAS SAFELY ABLE TO MOVE IT TO THE CURB. I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF CAR HAD SHUT OFF. I HAD IT TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALER AND THERE ARE WORKING ON IT. I JUST HAD A 45000 MILES FACTORY SERVICING WITH SAME DEALERSHIP WHERE THE CAR GOT TOWED TO AND THEY CHECKED ON ALL THE GREEN BOXES. WITHIN A WEEK, I HAD THIS ISSUE. THIS IS WHAT TROUBLING ME.",
