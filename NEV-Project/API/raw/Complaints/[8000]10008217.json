THEY LASTED APPROXIMATELY THREE MONTHS BEFORE HAVING TO HAVE THEM DONE AGAIN.  MY LAST VISIT COST ME $500 AND I EXPECT NOTHING LESS FROM THE DEALER THIS TIME.  THE HARMONIC PERIOD SEEMS TO BE MOST PRONOUNCED WHEN BRAKING AT 50 MPH WITH THE SEVERITY DECREASING AT A STANDARD BELL CURVE ABOVE AND BELOW THAT SPEED.   I AM CONCERNED OF MY SAFETY WHEN HAVING TO BRAKE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS FROM LOSS OF CONTROL OR FAILURE.  BASED ON THE COMPLAINTS I HAVE VIEWED, I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF A CLASS-ACTION SUIT WITH A REDESIGN OR BUY-BACK REMEDY.*JB",
