THE 5TH TRANSMISSION LASTED ONLY 3 WEEKS! THIS CAR IS PAID FOR AND I WANTED TO KEEP IT FOREVER. BUT, APPARENTLY, I WILL BE FORCED TO SELL IT(FOR NEXT TO NOTHING) BEFORE 100K MILES SINCE ACURA WILL ONLY REPLACE THEIR BAD TRANNY WITH A BADDER ONE FOR UP TO 100K MILES. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE. TWICE I HAVE HAD NEAR MISSES WHILE TRYING TO GET TO A SAFE PLACE AFTER THE TRANSMISSION TOTALLY LOCKED UP ON ME. CAN'T ANYONE DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?!?! HOW IS IT LEGAL, OR ETHICAL (EVEN THOUGH ETHICS SEEMS TO BE A THING OF THE PAST IN BUSINESS ANYMORE) TO CONTINUALLY PUT PEOPLE, AND THEIR FAMILIES, BACK ON THE STREET KNOWING THESE CARS ARE STILL UNSAFE. I AM SORRY, BUT I USED TO BELIEVE ACURA/HONDA WAS ABOVE THAT. OBVIOUSLY, I WAS WRONG. *AK",
