THE PISTONS THAT HOLD THE HOOD UP, GAVE WAY CAUSING THIS ACCIDENT. TO DATE I HAVE DIFFICULTY USING MY LEFT HAND CORRECTLY. I SPOKE WITH MANY ATTORNEYS AND THEY SAID SINCE THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY SIMILAR CASES TO MINE, NONE WOULD PURSUE IT. I CALLED FORD AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD MAKE A NOTE OF THE INCIDENT. FORD MANUFACTURED A DEFECT, HARMED ME AND EVERYONE JUST WANTS TO ROUND FILE THE CASE. WOULD YOUR GROUP LIKE TO SEE PICTURES OF MY CRUSHED FINGER? IT HAPPENED, AND FORD IS RESPONSIBLE. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?     GARRY MELOTT.   *JB",
