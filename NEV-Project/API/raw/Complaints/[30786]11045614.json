THE CAR DOES NOT RECOGNIZE WHEN I AM (OR NOT) PUSHING ON THE GAS PEDAL- SOMETIMES WHEN I LIGHTLY PUSH THE PEDAL, THE ENGINE REVS, OTHER TIMES THE CAR WON'T MOVE AT ALL. THIS HAS PUT ME (AND OTHER DRIVERS ON THE ROAD) IN A VERY DANGEROUS POSITION TO BE IN, THAT I CAN'T CONTROL MY CAR. I HAVE READ MANY THINGS ONLINE THAT THERE HAS BEEN THIS ISSUE WITH MANY OTHER FORD/LINCOLN CARS, FROM 2011-2015. WHEN CALLING MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP, THEY SAID THEY WILL NOT FIX THIS ISSUE FREE OF CHARGE, EVEN THOUGH FORD HAD A \"CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM\". I WAS TOLD MY CAR IS NOT IN THOSE THAT HAD THAT ISSUE.",
