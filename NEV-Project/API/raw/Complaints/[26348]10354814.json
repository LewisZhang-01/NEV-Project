        "summary": "WE OWN A 2005 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE. WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS 2 YEARS OLD AND AT 35,000 MILES THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON INDICATING THE TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE. THIS WAS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY. MY HUSBAND WAS KIND OF CONCERNED THAT THEY HAD THE PART IN STOCK FOR A TWO YEAR OLD VEHICLE BUT WE HAD IT FIXED AND WENT ON. NOW IT IS THREE YEARS LATER AT 89,000 MILES AND THE SAME PART NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. THEY WANT US TO PAY 750 TO HAVE IT REPLACED. WE FILED A CASE WITH CHRYSLER AND THEY WANT US TO HAVE IT DIAGNOSED FOR 89.00 AT THEIR DEALER AND THEN THEY WILL DISCUSS WHETHER THEY WILL HELP PAY FOR IT OR NOT. THERE ARE MANY OTHER PEOPLE ON THE WEB THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUES. OUR CAR WILL LIGHT UP ALL THE GEARS WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND WILL NOT SHIFT PROPERLY DUE TO THE ENGINE NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT GEAR WE ARE IN. I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO WORRY THAT THEY FIXED IT AND HELPED US THIS TIME BUT IN 2-3 YEARS WE HAVE TO DO THIS ALL OVER AGAIN FOR THE SAME PART. THE GENTLEMAN MY HUSBAND FIRST TALKED TO AT THE DEALER WE CONSULTED BEFORE TALKING WITH CHRYSLER STATED THAT HE HAS ALSO REPLACED THIS SAME PIECE IN HIS CHRYSLER 300 TWICE. I HAVE ALSO SEEN ON THE CAR FORUMS THAT THE JEEP COMMANDER IS DOING THE SAME THING AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS OUT THERE ABOUT THE 05 JEEP CHEROKEE. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY CHRYSLER CONTINUES TO PUT THIS PART THAT IS OBVIOUSLY NOT WORKING IN THEIR VEHICLES. THIS IS CAUSING ISSUES FOR THE CARS AND I AM NOT CONVINCED I WANT ANOTHER CHRYSLER PRODUCT. THE GEAR SHIFT SHOULD NOT BE HAVING PARTS REPLACED. I HAVE BEEN AROUND MANY VEHICLES AND NEVER HAD THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY A RECALL OR SOMETHING HASN'T BEEN DONE ON THIS PARTICULAR PART. WHY WOULD THEY NOT FIND A NEW WAY TO DO THIS TYPE OF GEAR SHIFT THAT DOESN'T FALL APART IN TWO YEARS OF DRIVING. THIS IS A FAMILY VEHICLE. THIS IS NOT A RACE CAR OR EVEN A 4WD. I JUST WANT TO GET HELP IN CASE OTHERS ARE STILL DEALING WITH THIS.  *TR",
