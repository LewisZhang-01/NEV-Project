THEY WOULD HAVE GLADLY SOLD ME A NEW TRUCK. SORRY, NO CAN DO. I TOOK THE TRUCK TO A WELD SHOP AND HAD THE FRAME PATCHED WITH NEW STEEL. PROBLEM FIXED. I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE MECHANIC'S AFTER LEARNING THAT HE CAN'T INSPECT IT BECAUSE OF THE SEVERELY RUSTED FRAME! IT JUST RUSTED AROUND THE PATCHES. JUNK PRICE IS WAY LOW BUT WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE?",
