HE THEN CHECKED OUT THE GAS CAP IF SECURE. AFTER AWHILE, THE LIGHT WENT OFF. I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT WAS THE GAS CAP BECAUSE I'M VERY CAREFUL ABOUT LOOSE GAS CAPS. ANYWAY, AFTER 2 DAYS OF DRIVING, THE LIGHT CAME OUT AGAIN. BEFOREHAND, HE SUGGESTED TO HAVE THE GAS CAP REPLACED IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN. SO I CHANGED IT & HAVE BEEN DRIVING AROUND FOR ALMOST 3 WEEKS NOW BUT THE LIGHT IS STILL THERE. SOMEBODY SAID THAT IT MIGHT TAKE  A COUPLE OF GAS TANK REFILLS BEFORE THE GAS CAP GET \"CROSS-THREADED\" OR SEALED TIGHT. I ALREADY HAD 2 REFILLS & THE LIGHT'S STILL THERE. THE VAN'S RUNNING WELL & AM EXPERIENCING NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER. I JUST WANT TO HAVE THAT LIGHT TURNED OFF.",
