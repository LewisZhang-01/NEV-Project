THE NEXT MORNING I ENTERED MY GARAGE AND SMELLED A STRONG ODOR OF GASOLINE. I COULD SEE GAS UNDERNEATH MY CAR BY THE REAR DRIVERS SIDE WHEEL AND THE ODOR OF GASOLINE WAS SO STRONG MY EYES WERE WATERING AND I COULDN'T BREATH WELL. I OPENED THE GARAGE DOOR AND MOVED THE CAR OUTSIDE(PUSHED IT OUTSIDE TO AVOID AN EXPLOSION).   THE ODOR OF GASOLINE IS VERY STRONG BY THE DRIVER'S SIDE REAR COMPARTMENT. I KEEP THE FUEL TANK AT HALF FULL OR LESS TO MINIMIZE THE GASOLINE VAPOROUS SMELL. I BOUGHT THE CAR IN CHICAGO AND DROVE IT HOME TO WASHINGTON STATE.  *TR",
