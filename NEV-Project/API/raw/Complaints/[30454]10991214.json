FIRST TIME ONE TIRE WAS FOUND TO BE OUT OF SPEC THEN 2ND TIME, ALL FOUR ARE IN 'SPEC'.  I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS A TIRE/WHEEL PROBLEM AS THE VIBRATION VARIES ON SMOOTH HIGHWAY - AT TIMES IT IS VERY SMOOTH THEN IT WILL START VIBRATING/BOUNCING.  VERY UNNERVING DRIVING AT THESE SPEEDS WITH A VIBRATION THAT FEELS LIKE A LOOSE WHEEL OR OTHER DRIVETRAIN PART.  MY SON HAD A 2015 MODEL HE BOUGHT NEW AND HE FINALLY SOLD IT DISCLOSING THE ISSUE (STILL UNDER WARRANTY) RATHER THAN CONTINUING TO WASTE TIME WITH GM.  PROBLEM HAS EXISTED SINCE I BOUGHT THE TRUCK NEW OCT. 2016.  2016 GMC SIERRA 2500HD DENALI 20\" FACTORY WHEELS.",
