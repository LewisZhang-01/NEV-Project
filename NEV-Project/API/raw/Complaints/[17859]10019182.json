THE EXPLANATION IS THAT WHEN APPLYING BRAKES ON A BUMPY ROAD SURFACE OR WHEN ONE SIDE OF THE ROAD IS MORE SLIPPERY THAN THE OTHER, YOU MAY ENCOUNTER EXTENDED STOPPING DISTANCES. THIS COULD LEAD TO A CRASH.    IN MY CASE, THIS LED TO A MINOR CRASH WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE WHICH RESULTED IN MINOR DAMAGE TO THE FRONT BUMPER OF MY ISUZU RODEO VEHICLE. I RECEIVED THIS CAMPAIGN NOTICE AFTER THE INCIDENT. WHEN I CONTACTED ISUZU TO REQUEST REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE DAMAGE I RECEIVED I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE HELD LIABLE SINCE THIS IS ONLY AN \"SAFETY IMPROVEMENT CAMPAIGN\" AND NOT A SAFETY RECALL. THIS SEEMS CONTRADICTORY TO WHAT IS IMPLIED AND I WOULD LIKE TO FILE A COMPLAINT AGAINST ISUZU IN THEIR HANDLING OF THIS MATTER AND TO DOCUMENT THAT THIS IS A POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS DEFECT.",
