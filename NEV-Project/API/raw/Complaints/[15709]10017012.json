SHORTLY AFTER THE CAR WAS PURCHASED, I BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE MECHANICAL DIFFICULTIES. FIRST, THE AIRBAG LIGHT ON THE CAR BEGAN TO BLINK. SECOND, THE AIR-CONDITIONING LIGHT BEGAN TO FLASH AND INTERRUPTED THE FUNCTION OF THE AIR CONDITIONING. IMMEDIATELY, I TOOK THE CAR TO THE TOYOTA DEALER. EACH TIME, THE TOYOTA MECHANICS CLAIMED TO HAVE CORRECTED THE PROBLEM AND EACH TIME THE PROBLEM RETURNED WITHIN 24 HOURS. THE CAR WAS TAKEN FIFTEEN SEPARATE OCCASIONS. THE WARRANTY ON THE CAR HAS SINCE EXPIRED AND THE PROBLEMS WERE NEVER CORRECTED.  *JB",
