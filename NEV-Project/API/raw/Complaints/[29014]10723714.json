ON JUNE 3RD 2015, AFTER DRIVING TO MY JOB TO PICK UP TOOLS TO HEAD TO THE AIRPORT I PARK THE CAR, CAME BACK TO A CAR THAT WOULD NOT START, THE CAR RECOGNIZES THE KEY BUT LOCKS ME OUT FROM STARTING THE CAR.  THE CAR HAD RANDOM WON'T START, I BROUGHT THIS UP TO THE NISSAN DEALERS ABOUT ONGOING ISSUES WITH OTHER OWNERS OF THE SAME CAR.  NOW MY CAR DOES NOT START AND I AM HEARING THAT THIS IS A GOING ISSUE WITH THE STEERING WHEEL LOCK/INTELLIGENT KEY.  I AM UNABLE TO MOVE THE CAR AND WILL HAVE TO TOW IT TO THE DEALER THAT DENIED ISSUES WITH THE INELLIGENT KEY SYSTEM LOCKING OWNERS FROM STARTING THEIR CARS.  I WANT TO BRING THIS UP SO THAT WAY WE SPEAK OUT SINCE THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVING ISSUES BUT NOT ENOUGH POST IT SO THAT A RECALL CAN BE MADE FOR NISSAN TO FIX THIS FOR OWNERS AFFECTED.",
