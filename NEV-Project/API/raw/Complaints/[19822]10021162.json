        "summary": "IN APRIL, 2000 MY 1995 TOYOTA 4-RUNNER NEEDED A NEW BLOCK.  WE WERE STILL UNDER WARRANTY AND HAD TOYOTA OF GARDEN GROVE DO THE WORK NECESSARY.   TOTAL CHARGES WERE 5300.  INSURANCE PICKED UP MOST OF THIS.  THEN IN MAY OF 2003, THE SAME THING HAPPENED-ONLY THIS TIME WE WERE NOT UNDER WARRANTY.  WITH RENTAL CARS AND REPAIRS, OUR TOTAL IS UP TO 3200.  WE WERE TOLD BY THE 2ND MECHANICS THAT THE FIRST MECHANICS WHO CLAIMED TO PUT IN ALL NEW ENGINE AND PARTS THAT THIS WAS NOT SO.  THIS SEEMS ABSURB FOR A VEHICLE THAT HAS ONLY 93,000 MILES ON IT TO NEED 2 ENGINES IN A 3 YEAR PERIOD.  WE WERE COMPLETELY LIED TO BY TOYOTA OF GARDEN GROVE-THUS CAUSING US ALOT OF MONEY IN REPAIRS THIS TIME AROUND. I AM NOT A NEGLIGENT CAR OWNER-I MAINTAIN MY CAR BECAUSE I AM AWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES IF YOU LET THINGS GO.  MY FATHER HAS WORKED AS A SERVICE MANAGER MY WHOLE LIFE SO I AM AWARE OF MAINTAINING A CAR.  *AK",
