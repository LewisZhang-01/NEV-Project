EVEN AFTER PRESSING THE GAS PEDAL TO THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE EXTENT, IT COULDN'T PICK UP A SPEED ABOVE 20-25 MPH. THIS COULD HAVE TURNED INTO A SERIOUS ACCIDENT AS I COULD HAVE BEEN REAR-ENDED BY OTHER CARS. I DROVE THE CAR TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP OF THE MANUFACTURER FOR SERVICING BUT THEY COULDN'T PROVIDE ANY SERVICE FACILITY AS THEY HAD A BUSY SCHEDULE AND GAVE ME AN APPOINTMENT FOR MONDAY (8/13/2012). THEN I CALLED AAA ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND THEY TOWED IT TO THEIR NEAREST CERTIFIED SERVICE CENTER, WHO DETECTED THAT THERE WAS PROBLEM WITH THE THROTTLE BODY WHICH IS AN ELECTRONIC PART FOR THIS TYPE OF CAR. REQUEST YOUR HELP TO GET MY CAR THOROUGHLY INSPECTED AND GET IT REPAIRED / REPLACED / MONEY REFUND BY THE MANUFACTURER.  *TR",
