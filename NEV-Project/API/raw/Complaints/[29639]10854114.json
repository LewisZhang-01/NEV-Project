        "summary": "THE TRUCK HAS HAD THIS ISSUE SINCE I'VE PURCHASED THE TRUCK BUT CAN NEVER DUPLICATE THE ISSUE WHILE AT THE DEALERSHIP. THE 1ST TIME THE ENGINE WOULD CRANK BUT WOULD NOT FIRE. THE SECOND TIME, I WAS DRIVING AND THE TRUCK JUST STOPPED. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH SOME PASSING BY MOTORIST HELPED TO PUSH IT OUT OF THE INTERSECTION. 3RD TIME, THE TRUCK WAS PARKED AND DID NOT START. AFTER TROUBLESHOOTING THE ISSUE, THE FUEL PUMP RELAY FUSE BURNED OUT. NORMALLY FUSES JUST POP, THIS ONE JUST BURNED OUT TO WHERE I COULD NOT TAKE OUT THE FUSE. TOOK THE TRUCK TO WAS BOUGHT AT AND AFTER A FEW HOURS, THE PROBLEM WAS LOCATED. THE SHOP FOREMAN STATED THAT THEY HAVE HAD ALOT OF TRUCKS GO IN WITH THE SAME ISSUE. ONLY REASON I MAKING A COMPLAINT IS DUE TO THAT COMMENT. IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE WHEN I WAS DRIVING AND TRUCK SHUTS OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION. WHAT IF MY SONS WERE WITH ME? HOPE THIS GETS RESOLVED AND A RECALLED IS MADE BEFORE SOMETHING WORSE HAPPENS TO SOMEONE ELSE. THANK YOU.  *TR",
