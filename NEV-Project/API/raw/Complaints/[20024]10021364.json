FORD HAS NOTIFIED USERS OF THE POSSIBILITY OF RIMS DEVELOPING CRACKS AND TIRES LOSING AIR. I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH FORD AND WITH FORD DEALERSHIPS IN OUR AREA REGARDING THE REPLACEMENT OF RIMS. FORD HAS NOTIFIED US THAT IF THE RIM DOES NOT SHOW A CRACK THEY WILL NOT REPLACE IT. WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO TEST THE RIM WITH A PENETRANT AND DEVELOPER, MAGNAFLUX AND ACTUAL X-RAYS. WE FEEL THAT FORD IS IGNORING A POTENTIAL SERIOUS SAFETY INCIDENT AND BRUSHING THIS OFF \"UNTIL NEW RIMS COME OFF PRODUCTION\". IF A FLEET STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT RIMS BE REPLACED BECAUSE THEY SEE WHAT THEY FEEL IS A DEFICIENCY FORD SHOULD HONOR THAT REQUEST. WHAT SURPRISES AND DISMAYS US IS THE ATTITUDE THEY HAVE AND THEIR FAILURE TO ISSUE A RECALL.*AK",
