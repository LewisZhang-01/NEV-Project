TOOK VEHICLE TO JEEP DEALER AND WAS TOLD THERE IS A PRODUCT PROBLEM WITH FRONT ROTORS, CALIPERS AND PADS AND THAT MANUFACTURER HAS ISSUED AN UPGRADE KIT.  DEALER SAID HE SEES THIS ON MANY, MANY GRAND CHEROKEES.  I HAD JUST HAD MY PADS REPLACED 14,000 BEFORE THIS INCIDENT.  JEEP DEALER COULD NOT WORK ON MY VEHICLE FOR A WEEK SO I HAD TO HAVE NEW ROTORS AND PADS PUT ON BY ANOTHER REPAIR FACILITY.   CALLED CHRYSLER-JEEP CONSUMER HOTLINE.  ASKED IF THEY WERE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND IF THEY KNEW ABOUT THE NHSTA SUMMARY BULLETIN NUMBER.  I WAS TOLD IF I PERSISTED IN SEEKING AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION I WOULD BE DISCONNECTED.  I ASKED AGAIN AND WAS DISCONNECTED.  WHAT KIND OF STONE WALLING IS HAPPENING HERE?  PLEASE CHECK INTO THIS INCIDENT.  I HAVE READ OF OTHER WHERE ROTOR HAD BROKEN OFF AND CAUSED WHEEL TO LOCK UP. TS",
