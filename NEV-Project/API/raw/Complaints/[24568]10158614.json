IT DOES NOT MATTER WHETHER I STOMP ON THE BRAKE OR BRAKE WITH INCREASING PRESSURE,THE ANTILOCK WILL NOT ENGAGE NOR WILL THE TIRES LOCK UP. I REPLACED ALL 4 ROTORS AND PADS (NON OE @ 62,500 MILES). THE LACK OF BRAKING WAS STILL PRESENT. NEXT I REPLACED THE MASTER CYLINDER WHICH HAS NOT SOLVED THE PROBLEM. I JUST HAD THE DEALER LOOK AT THE SYSTEM, THEY NOTED THE REAR PADS WERE WORN (AFTER 8,000 MILES). THE DEALERSHIP ALSO SAID THE NON OE PADS WERE PROBABLY THE CAUSE OF THE LACK OF BRAKING. MY CONCERN WAS THE FACT THAT THE LACK OF BRAKING STARTED WHEN THE OE PADS WERE STILL ON THE TRUCK.  *NM",
