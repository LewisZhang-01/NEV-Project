REPORTED TO FORD, THEY HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT. DEALER PERSON SAID THEY HAVE REPLACED SEVERAL OF THESE AND THIS IS IN A SMALL RURAL TOWN. TANK WAS BACK ORDERED FOR A MONTH. I WOULD THINK THAT A HOLE IN A GASOLINE TANK WOULD BE HAZARDOUS, AND GIVEN THE STATEMENT OF SEEING SEVERAL OF THESE IN ONE DEALERSHIP PLUS THE BACKORDER SITUATION INDICATES THIS IS A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM.",
