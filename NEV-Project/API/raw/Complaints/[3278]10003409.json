TOOK IT TO THE DEALER, THE DEALER'S MECHANIC SAID HE HAS REPLACED A VALVE ON THE TRANSMISSION OF FOUR 2000 BLAZERS SO FAR THIS YEAR.  I WILL MAKE NUMBER FIVE - QUOTED COST OF $850.  SERVICE CENTER WILL NOT COVER UNDER WARRANTY.  READ SEVERAL REPORTS ABOUT TRANSMISSION ISSUES SIMILAR TO MINE ON 2000 BLAZERS AND S-10S.  WHY NO RECALL?  IF THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM, WHY AM I NOT COVERRED UNDER EXTENDED WARRANTY?!!",
