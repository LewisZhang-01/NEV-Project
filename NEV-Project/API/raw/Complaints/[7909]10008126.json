HIGH AND LOW LIGHT UP ON DASH BOARD AND WHEN PUT IN DRIVE, IT MAKES THE THUMP AS THOUGH IT IS IN 4 WHEEL DRIVE. WE THOUGHT ALL ALONG IT WAS WORKING UNTIL WE GOT HUNG UP 2 WEEKS AGO IN A DRIVE WAY AND THE FRONT WHEELS WOULD NOT MOVE. I THINK IT WAS BROKE BEFORE THE 36000 MILE WARRANTY EXPIRED. BUT FORD WILL NOT CONSIDER FIXING IT WITHOUT US PAYING FOR IT.  *JB",
