WHEN I REMOVED THE TIRE I DISCOVERED THE INNER SIDEWALL OF MY GOODYEAR EAGLE GT II (P215/60R16) HAD A SLASH/SPLIT AND THE RUBBER ON THE SIDEWALL WAS PEELING AWAY FROM THE REINFORCING FABRIC INSIDE THE TIRES.  ON MAY 30, 2003, I HAD AN IDENTICAL FAILURE ON THE FRONT RIGHT TIRE, WHILE TRAVELING ON THE SAME ROAD, UNDER THE SAME WEATHER CONDITIONS, AT THE SAME TIME OF DAY, AFTER DRIVING THE SAME DISTANCE (ABOUT 10-12  MILES FROM HOME).  ALL FOUR TIRES ON THE CAR WERE PURCHASED FROM A GOODYEAR DEALERSHIP  ON NOVEMBER 25, 2000, AND HAVE APPROXIMATELY 40,000 MILES OF WEAR.  INFLATION PRESSURE WAS ROUTINELY CHECKED AND THE TIRES WERE ROTATED EVERY 5,000 TO 7,000 MILES.  AS A PRECAUTION I AM REPLACING THE REMAINING TWO TIRES.   *JB",
