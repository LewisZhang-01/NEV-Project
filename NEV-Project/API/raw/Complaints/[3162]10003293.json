I WAS TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 65 MILES PER HOUR WHEN THE TRANSMISSION DOWNSHIFTED FROM 5TH TO 2ND GEAR.  FORTUNATELY, NO ONE PLOWED INTO THE BACK OF ME, AND THE CAR WAS STILL DRIVABLE AFTER THIS OCCURRED.  THE CAR IS NOW AT THE DEALER, WAITING FOR IT'S TRANSMISSION TO BE REPLACED.  I PURCHASED THE CAR IN DECEMBER 2001 AND AT DROP-OFF AT THE DEALER, THE CAR ONLY HAS 7998 MILES ON IT.    I DON'T CARE IF I HAVE A 7YR/100K WARRANTY EXTENSION ON THE TRANSMISSION, THIS TYPE OF FAILURE IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND SOMETHING THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE ACURA.  I AM CONCERNED ABOUT NOT ONLY MY SAFETY, BUT ALSO THE SAFETY OF MY WIFE.",
