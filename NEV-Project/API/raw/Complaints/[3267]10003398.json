MASTER CYLINDER HAS BEEN REPLACED MORE THAN ONCE, BRAKES HAVE BEEN BLED, ABS PUMP HAS BEEN REPLACED, AND WE ARE NOW LEAKING FLUID AND READY TO HAVE IT SERVICED AGAIN. THIS IS A FAMILY VEHICLE THAT I DON'T ALWAYS FEEL SAFE DRIVING MY TWO SMALL CHILDREN IN. WE ONLY HAVE 17,800 MILES ON THE VAN, I WONDER IF WE DROVE IT MORE OFTEN IF WE WOULD BE IN THE SHOP EVEN MORE FREQUENTLY.THREE TIMES I HAVE GONE TO PULL OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY AND HAVE ALMOST ENDED UP IN THE NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE STREETS YARD. THE DEALERSHIP WHERE THE VAN WAS PURCHASED HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING TO ACCOMODATE US AND WON'T EVEN GIVE US A GOOD DEAL ON A TRADE-IN SO THAT WE CAN GET RID OF IT.",
