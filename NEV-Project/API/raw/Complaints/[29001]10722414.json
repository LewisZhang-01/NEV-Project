THE OPEN WRENCH SIGN CAME UP ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL, INDICATING POWERTRAIN PROBLEM.  LUCK FOR US, A DEPUTY CAME ALONG, AND ASK TO HELP, HE SAID TRY TO RESTART IT, WE HAD SIT FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES, THE OPEN WRENCH LIGHT WAS GONE, AND THE CAR WE COULD DRIVE ON HOME, TOOK TO THE PLAZA LINCOLN DEALER THE NEXT DAY, AND THEY RAN THE COMPUTER TEST AND THE PINPOINT TEST AND COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING, BUT I HAVE FOUND ON THE INTERNET, THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM! I GUESS WE HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE KILLED BEFORE ANYONE WILL DO A RECALL ON THIS PROBLEM, SAD MONEY IS MORE IMPORTANT THEN PEOPLE'S LIVES.  *TR",
