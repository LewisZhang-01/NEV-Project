I HAVE HAD MULTIPLE (2) TRANSMISSION FAILURES THAT DID NOT RESULT IN ANY COLLISIONS OR INJURIES.  HOWEVER, I FEEL LUCKY THAT NO SUCH INCIDENTS OCCURED AS THE CAR DID DECELERATE RAPIDLY, WITHOUT WARNING WHILE TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  THE CAR ALSO DID NOT ACCELERATE AS IT SHOULD WHEN PULLING OUT INTO BUSY INTERSECTIONS.  DRIVING DURING THESE EPISODES OF TRANSMISSION FAILURE WAS QUITE FRIGHTENING.       THE TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED AT ABOUT 8500 MILES AND ABOUT 26000 MILES.",
