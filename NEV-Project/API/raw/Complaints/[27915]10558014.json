TESTED THE BULB AND IT WAS GOOD.  OPENED THE FUSE BOX UNDER THE HOOD AND NOTICED THE 30 AMP FUSE (TOP LEFT CORNER OF BOX) WAS BURNED/MELTED.  ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE AND WAS UNABLE TO REMOVE.  IN ADDITION THE CORRESPONDING 15 AMP FUSE WAS BURNED OUT BUT NOT MELTED.  CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS INFORMED THAT MY PARTICULAR VEHICLE WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE NHTSA INVESTIGATION FOR FAULTY FUSE BOX.  RESEARCHED FURTHER AND DISCOVERED THAT TIGUAN MODELS FROM 09-12 WERE UNDER INVESTIGATION.  IN ADDITION TO THE FRONT  HEADLIGHT I ALSO REPLACED THE RIGHT REAR LIGHT WHICH WAS ALSO OUT.  I DID NOT TEST THE EXISTING BULB ON THIS LIGHT.  JUST REPLACED.  I WOULD LIKE FOR THIS TO SERVICE A FORMAL COMPLAINT TO THE NHTSA REGARDING WHAT APPEARS TO ME AS AN UNSAFE CONDITION IN THE FUSE BOX.    *TR",
