        "summary": "HAVE 2009 TOYOTA TACOMA TRD SPORT PCKG. TRUCK THAT I BOUGHT IN FEBRUARY. WHEN SLOWING DOWN TO TURN ONTO ANOTHER STREET, ONCE I TURN AND PRESS THE GAS PEDAL TO ACCELERATE, THE ENGINE REVS AND THE TRANSMISSION TAKES ABOUT 2-3 SECONDS TO SHIFT GEARS. HAPPENS 5-6 TIMES A WEEK, WHETHER ENGINE IS COLD OR HOT. SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD, AS THIS HAS HAPPENED WHEN MAKING A U-TURN IN TRAFFIC WITH CARS APPROACHING. TWO DIFFERENT TOYOTA MECHANICS TOLD ME THE TRANNY IS COMPUTER OPERATED AND NEEDS TO LEARN MY DRIVING HABITS. TOLD ME IT WILL TAKE AT LEAST 5,000 MILES FOR THE COMPUTER TO LEARN MY DRIVING HABITS AND FOR TRANSMISSION TO ADJUST. I HAVE OVER 3700 MILES NOW AND TRANNY STILL SEEMS WEIRD. STILL SLIPPING WHEN SLOWING DOWN AND THEN ACCELERATING ONTO ANOTHER STREET. ALSO, TRUCK FEELS LIKE THE TRANSMISSION TIGHTENS UP WHEN SLOWING DOWN FROM 30MPH TO 20MPH (IT DOES NOT SEEM TO COAST FREELY, ALMOST LIKE THE BREAKS ARE BEING SLIGHTLY APPLIED). CAN FEEL THE DOWNSHIFTING, EVEN THOUGH IT IS AN AUTOMATIC. MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THE COMPUTER DRIVEN TRANNY SLOWS THE TRUCK DOWN UNDER 30 MPH AS THAT IS PART OF THE BRAKING SYSTEM. WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF OF THE GAS, THE COMPUTER PREPARES TO BRAKE AND THUS THE TRANNY PREPARES FOR A STOP HE SAID. MECHANIC ALSO TOLD ME THE CAMRY'S HAD AN ISSUE WITH THEIR TRANSMISSIONS AND TOYOTA HAD TO REPROGRAM THE COMPUTERS. TOYOTA DEALERSHIP RAN A COMPUTER \"COLD START\" TEST AND SAID EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL. HAVE FILED A COMPLAINT WITH NATIONAL TOYOTA HOTLINE. NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET ABOUT THIS SAME ISSUE. *TR",
