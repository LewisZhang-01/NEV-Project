        "summary": "I CURRENTLY HAVE 4 AFTER MARKET WHEELS ON MY 1989 HONDA CIVIC DX HATCHBACK MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY ALT (WWW.ALTWHEELS.COM).    ON FRIDAY, DECEMBER 28, 2002, I HAD A TIRE BLOW OUT ON THE FREEWAY. I WAS DRIVING AT 55MPH. WHEN I BROUGHT MY CAR TO THE AUTHORIZED SERVICE STATION, I WAS ADVISED THAT THE WHEELS HAD A NUMBER OF LARGE CRACKS ON THEM AND WERE DEFECTIVE, THUS, CAUSING MY TIRE TO BLOW OUT.    AS A RESULT OF THESE DEFECTIVE WHEELS, I NOW HAVE A BLOWN OUT TIRE, A BROKEN FRONT AXLE, AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS DAMAGE. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.    IN A PHONE CONVERSATION ON DECEMBER 31, 2002, I REQUESTED THAT THE MANUFACTURER REPLACE ALL 4 WHEELS WITH ANOTHER MODEL WHEEL SIMILAR IN STYLE, APPEARANCE, AND PRICE. THE MANUFACTURER DECLINED.    THESE WHEELS ARE UNSAFE AND NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED, IF NOT RECALLED, PROMPTLY. TS",
