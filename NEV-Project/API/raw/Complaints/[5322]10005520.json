IT MAY GROW WITH YOUR CHILD BUT IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT KEEP YOUR CHILD SAFE.  DUE TO THE CONSTANT TWISTING, YOU CANNOT SECURE YOUR CHILD TIGHTLY IN THE SEAT.  DOES THE PUBLIC HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL A CHILD IS SERIOUSLY INJURED BEFORE RECALLING THIS PRODUCT?  AT THE VERY LEAST COSCO SHOULD PROVIDE A HEAVIER STRAP.  THOUGH I HAVE ENTERED THE DATE I WROTE THIS COMPLAINT AS THE INCIDENT DATE, THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN ONE FOR MY FAMILY FOR A YEAR NOW.",
