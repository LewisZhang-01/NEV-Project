THE PLASTIC CLIPS ON THE SIDE OF THE LIGHT ASSEMBLY THAT ATTACHES TO THE SMALL METAL CLIP AND SCREW BREAKS OFF ALLOWING THE LIGHT ASSEMBLY TO FALL OUT OF THE TRUCK BED AND HANG BY THE REAR LIGHT WIRING HARNESS.  WHILE DRIVING THE TRUCK IT STRIKES A POTHOLE OR ROUGH PLACE IN THE ROAD THE PLASTIC CLIPS BREAK AND THE TAIL LIGHT ASSEMBLY FALLS OUT OF THE TRUCK.  I HAVE SEEN SEVERAL TRUCKS WITH THE REAR LIGHT ASSEMBLY TAPED UP TO SECURE THE LIGHTS. THIS IS VERY EXPENSIVE TO REPLACE THIS LIGHT ASSEMBLY.   *TR",
