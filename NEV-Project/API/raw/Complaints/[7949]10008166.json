        "summary": "MY COMPLAINT CONCERNS NHTSA'S APPARENT FOCUS ON SUVS, WHEN THERE IS A MUCH GREATER DANGER ON THE HIGHWAYS. 18 WHEEL TRUCKS.  IN GOOD WEATHER, TRACTOR TRAILER ACCIDENTS OCCUR WEEKLY NEAR LITTLE ROCK, FREQUENTLY KILLING PEOPLE AND ALWAYS BLOCKING THE INTERSTATE FOR LONG PERIODS.  IN BAD WEATHER, AS WE EXPERIENCED THIS WEEK, THESE TRUCKS CONTINUE OPERATING ON SLIPPERY ROADS WITH COMPLETE DISREGARD FOR CARS OR THE PEOPLE INSIDE.  JACK-KNIFED TRUCKS BLOCKED TRAFFIC FOR OVER 6 HOURS IN FREEZING TEMPERATURES IN A SINGLE INCIDENT ON I-30 SOUTH OF LITTLE ROCK YESTERDAY.  I ASK NHTSA TO FORCE MORE ATTENTION ON THIS MATTER... TO DEVELOP REASONABLE SPEED LIMITS THAT LOWER IN RAINY WEATHER, AND PERHAPS STOP TRUCK TRAFFIC WHEN SNOW OR ICE IS ON THE HIGHWAY.  PERHAPS THERE SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT TO KEEP THESE VEHICLES IN THE RIGHT LANE ONLY... AND PERHAPS NHTSA CAN FIND A WAY TO USE REVENUE FROM LARGE TRUCKS TO FINANCE A SEPARATE LANE... BUILT TO HANDLE THE GREATER WEIGHT ON NEW INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS.  I REALIZE THIS MAY NOT BE SO GREAT A PROBLEM IN ALL LOCATIONS, BUT LITTLE ROCK IS WHERE INTERSTATES 40 AND 30 MEET.  [XXX] NEAR ALL TRUCKS IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE US MUST TRAVEL THROUGH THESE HIGHWAYS.  THANKS FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.*JB    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
