ALSO I'D POINT OUT I KNOW A FEW PEOPLE WITH SAME PROBLEM AND THEY WILL DOCUMENT THEIR COMPLAINTS AS WELL.CAR TURNS ON AND ONLY MOVES IN REVERSE, ONCE YOU TRY TO PLACE IT IN DRIVE IT SHUTS OFF. DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION. THIS HAPPENED TO US WHILE WE WERE COMING OUT OF THE HIGHWAY AND GOING TO A RED LIGHT STOP. WHILE WE CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP THE CAR SHOOK REAL HARD AS IF WE HIT SOMETHING AND SHUT OFF. WE TURNED ON CAR WITHOUT A PROBLEM BUT AS SOON AS WE PLACED IT IN DRIVE THE SAME THING HAPPENED A BIG HIT IN ENGINE AND IT SHUT OFF. ALSO AIBAG LIGHTS ARE ON WHICH IVE HEARD MEANS THAT THEY ARE FAULTY",
