AT FIRST IT WOULD TAKE ONE OR TOW TRIES THEN IT WAS TAKING UP TO 5 MINUTES. WHEN I TOOK IT IN FOR SERVICE I WAS TOLD THE CAR WOULD NOT CODE AND THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM, THEREFORE THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO, BUT TO HAVE IT TOWED BACK IN IF IT DID IT AGAIN.   IT WAS FINE FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS AND NOW IT IS DOING IT AGAIN. THIS WEEKEND I WAS STRANDED FOR 30-40 MINUTES BEFORE MY CAR WOULD START AGAIN AND I COULDN'T HAVE IT TOWED BECAUSE I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.  I CALLED DEALERSHIP TO INFORM THEM THAT IT WAS HAPPENING AGAIN AND I WAS TOLD THAT IF THEY CAN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT THEY CAN DO! SPOKE TO A DEALERSHIP IN ORLANDO AND WAS TOLD THAT IT IS PROBABLY THE FUEL SENSOR. LOCAL DEALERSHIP REFUSES TO ACCEPT THIS AS THE PROBLEM.*AK",
