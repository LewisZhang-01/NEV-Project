THEY STATED THE PROBLEM IS AIR LEAKING AROUND THE 2 RIMS AND THAT SEALS ARE BREAKING, POSSIBLY DUE TO WHEEL CORROSION.  THE PROBLEM IS WORSENING.   THIS IS THE 2ND SET OF WHEELS.  MITSUBISHI REPLACED ALL 4 WHEELS ONCE BEFORE FOR THE SAME PROBLEM--AT THAT TIME, AIR LEAKED OUT OF ALL 4 TIRES.  MITSUBISHI STATES THEY WILL NOT REPLACE THIS SET OF WHEELS DUE TO VEHICLE AGE AND PROBABLY NO INVESTIGATION  ALTHOUGH AT LEAST 9 CONSUMER COMPLAINTS ON NHTSA WEBSITE ARE LOGGED ON THE SAME MAKE/MODEL.  NOT SURE WHY ANYONE SHOULD EXPECT IT'S ACCEPTABLE TO NEED A 3RD SET OF RIMS FOR A 6-YEAR-OLD CAR.  COINCIDENCE?",
