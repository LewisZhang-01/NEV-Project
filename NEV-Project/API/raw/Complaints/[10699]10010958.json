STARTED AS AN ENGINE KNOCK (LIFTER NOISE) WHILE ACCELERATING UPHILL.  UNABLE TO DETERMINE CAUSE OR REPAIR.  USED MOBILE 1 OIL FOR 2 YEARS, ELIMINATED NOISE.  IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR AFTER REPLACEMENT OF INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET, SEVERE LOSS OF OIL PRESSURE AND ENGINE NOISE BEGAN.  IMMEDIATELY STOPPED ENGINE AND TOOK TO A REPAIR FACILITY WHERE I WAS TOLD ENGINE NEEDED TO BE REBUILT.  I NEVER THOUGHT A 350 5.7 LITER CHEVY ENGINE WOULD LAST ONLY 102,000 MILES.  MY MECHANIC KNOWS OF THREE OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  I NEVER MISSED AN OIL CHANGE IN 10 YEARS AND HAVE DOCUMENTATION TO PROVE IT.  HAS ANYONE HEARD OF SIMILAR PROBLEMS?  ARE THERE ANY RECALLS?       *JB",
