MY JEEP (WITH 37,000 MILES ON IT) STARTED TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY.  THE STEERING WHEEL WAS ALMOST UNCONTROLLABLE AND THE TIRES WERE LOSING CONTACT WITH THE ROAD.  I HAD TO PULL OVER AND STOP ON THE HIGHWAY TO REGAIN CONTROL OF MY VEHICLE.  THIS IS WHAT I NOW HAVE COME TO KNOW AS THE JEEP \"DEATH WOBBLE\" .  I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO WORK WITH MY DEALER, BUT APPARENTLY EVERYONE WHO OWNS A JEEP KNOWS ABOUT THE PROBLEM - EXCEPT JEEP.  THIS DEATH WOBBLE HAS HAPPENED ABOUT SIX TIMES IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS. *TR",
