THEY REPLACED THE ROTOR ASSEMBLY, BUT NEVER LOCATED THE CAUSE OF THE STEERING ISSUE.  THIS ISSUE HAS CONTINUED TO THIS DAY.  LAST WEEK I MET ANOTHER CHEVY SILVERADO OWNER WHO HAD EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM AND HAD RECEIVED A RECALL ON THIS ISSUE. I'VE NEVER BEEN NOTIFIED NOR HAVE I SEEN THE BULLETIN ON THIS SITE (HE RECOMMENDED THIS SITE TO OBTAIN THE DATA).  HIS VEHICLE WAS THE SAME MAKE & MODEL, BUT ONE YEAR OLDER (MINE IS A 2004).  THIS 'CLUNKING' NOISE/FEEL IS CONSISTENT WHEN TURNING CORNERS IN EITHER DIRECTION.  IT EFFECTS THE PERFORMANCE FEEL OF THE VEHICLE. AND LEAVES US WONDERING IF THE STEERING BOX IS ABOUT TO FALL APART AT ANY MOMENT.  PLEASE ADVISE IF RECALL HAS IN FACT BEEN ISSUED FOR THIS MAKE & MODEL YEAR.  *TR",
