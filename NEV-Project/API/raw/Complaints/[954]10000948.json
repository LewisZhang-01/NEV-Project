THE BACK WINDOW IS PLEXY GLASS, ALSO NONE OF THE HOSE ARE HOOKED UP UNDER THE HOOD. THIS MAKES IT RUN REAL RICH AND THE OIL LEAKS SO BAD THAT EVERY WEEK I HAVE TO PUT IN 2 QUARTS OF OIL. THERE WAS ALSO A GAS LEAK THAT WAS SMALL AND GOT WORSE AS TIME WENT ON. I TRIED TO FIX THE GAS LEAK BUT I CAN'T FIND A USED ONE ANY WHERE. AS FOR FIXING THE REST OF THE STUFF I STILL OWE MONEY ON THE BRONCO WHICH I HAVE NOT PAID BECAUSE ITS NOT STREET LEGAL I HAD TO BUY A DIFFERENT CAR JUST TO GET BACK AND FORTH TO WORK BECAUSE I WAS AFRED I WOULD BE IN A CRASH BECAUSE OF NO BRAKE LIGHTS.TS",
