AGAIN ON 11/29/02 IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  THE SAME COMPONENTS (SENDING UNITS) WERE REPLACED FOR THE SECOND TIME.  I AM A MEMBER OF CORVETTEFORUM.COM AND SEE THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN ON GOING SINCE 1997 WHEN THE C-5 CORVETTE WAS INTRODUCED.  IT IS STILL HAPPENING ON THE 2003 MODELS WITH ONE OWNER HAVING IT OCCUR AT 800 MILES ON A 2003 MODEL.  CAN'T GET CHEVROLET TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM SO IT WON'T COME BACK.  CHEVROLET  DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE A FIX FOR THE PROBLEM AFTER 7 YEARS OF BUILDING THE C-5!  I NEED SOME HELP IN GETTING THIS ISSUE RESOLVED BEFORE MY WARRANTY EXPIRES IN APRIL 2003. TS",
