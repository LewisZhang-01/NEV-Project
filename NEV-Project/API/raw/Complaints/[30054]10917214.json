THEY ARE CAUSING SERIOUS GROOVES ON THE OUTER 2 CAM BEARINGS THAT HAVE THE LARGER RELEASE HOLES. MY MOTOR FAILED DUE TO THIS. I WAS DRIVING, CAR STOPPED RUNNING, I THOUGHT MY TIMING SLIPPED. I PULLED THE MOTOR APART AND MY CAM WAS SEIZED UP AFTER LOOKING INTO IT FURTHER. I ORDER A NEW MOTOR SAME YEAR, MAKE, MODEL, THINKING IT WAS JUST MY MOTOR. I PULLED THE NEW MOTOR APART AND I FOUND THE SAME ISSUE! THE CAM WAS GETTING SCORED DUE TO THE OIL RELEASE HOLE NOT BEING SMOOTH. I ALSO REALIZED THAT ON THE SIDE THAT WAS NOT GETTING DAMAGED IT HAD AN OIL SYLPH, AND WHICH THE SIDE THAT WAS GETTING DAMAGED DID NOT.  *TR",
