TWO WEEKS AGO, AS MY FATHER WAS REPLACING THE REAR BREAK PADS, HE NOTICED THE LINKAGE CONNECTING THE REAR SWAY BAR TO THE LEFT REAR WHEEL ASSEMBLY WAS BROKEN AT THE WELD POINTS.  THIS BROKEN LINKAGE HAD CAUSED THE INSIDE BREAK PAD TO WEAR AT MUCH GREATER RATE THAN THE OUTSIDE PAD. MY UNCLE IS ALSO AN OWNER OF A 2001 HONDA ACCORD V6 SEDAN AND UPON HEARING OF THE BROKEN SWAY BAR IN MY FATHER??S CAR, HE INSPECTED THE REAR SWAY BAR IN HIS ACCORD AND FOUND THAT THE SAME LINKAGES WERE BROKEN ON BOTH SIDES.  HIS BROKEN LINKAGES ALSO CAUSED THE SAME PATTERN OF UNEVEN BRAKE WEAR IN HIS CAR.    *NLM",
