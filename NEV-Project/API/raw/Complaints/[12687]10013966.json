BOTH MYSELF AND MY PASSENGER WERE TRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL AND RECEIVED CHEST INJURIES AND NECK INJURIES. THE SENSOR FOR THE AIRBAGS IS COMPLETELY EXPOSED AND CRUSHED WHERE THE FRONT END OF THE CAR USED TO BE. I DID CALL HONDA EXPECTING THEM TO BE AT LEAST INTERESTED BUT THEY WERE LESS THAN INTERESTED. I CALLED BACK AND ASKED TO SPEAK TO A SUPERVISOR BUT THEY REFUSED TO LET ME DO SO. THEY DID SAY THE AIRBAGS ONLY DEPLOY DURING A \"SEVERE\" IMPACT. I POINTED OUT TO THE GUY THAT THE OWNER'S BOOK SAYS \"MODERATE TO SEVERE\".  HE JUST SAID \"REALLY?\". I TRUSTED HONDA LIKE MOST CONSUMERS DO. I DON'T ANYMORE.  *JB",
