THE VEHICLE BOGS DOWN, RELEASING THE THROTTLE OR PUSHING IN THE CLUTCH PEDAL AND THE VEHICLE IDLE IS NORMAL. IF THE THROTTLE IS PUSHED DOWN AND THE RPMS RISE, THE PROBLEM GOES AWAY.  WHEN THIS OCCURS THE VEHICLE CAN BOG DOWN AND THEN STRAIGHTEN OUT THE SPEED WILL RESUME TO WHERE IT SHOULD BE.  THIS IS AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM WITH NO RHYME OR REASON ASSOCIATED WITH IT.  I HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE IN THE SHOP SEVERAL TIMES AND HAVE ASKED COUNTLESS NUMBER OF PEOPLE.  INTERNET SEARCH HAD SHOWN THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM AND NO ONE HAS AN ANSWER AS TO THE CAUSE OR THE RELIEF.  THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING AS LONG AS I HAVE OWNED THE CAR AND I NOTICED IT THE FIRST TIME I DROVE IT.  I BOUGHT IS USED AND IT HAD NO WARRANTY.  VEHICLE NEEDED EXHAUST MANIFOLD AND TIRES WHEN I BOUGHT IT.  NOTHING ELSE WAS MENTIONED.  I FEEL THIS IS A HAZARD, AS IT IS UNPREDICTABLE AND IT HAS OCCURRED IN PARKING LOTS, AS WELL AS ON THE OPEN ROAD.  I HAVE READ OTHER PEOPLE HAVING THIS PROBLEM AND IT SEEMS TO BE ONLY WITH THE HONDA 1.6 LITER SOHC VTEC  16Y8 ENGINE.  THIS IS THE ENGINE THAT I HAVE IN MY CIVIC EX.  *NLM",
