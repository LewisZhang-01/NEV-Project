        "summary": "WE OWN AN EDDIE BAUER COSCO CARSEAT (MODEL #22-750-MET) MANUFACTURED 8/10/02 AT LOCATION \"AO2C.\"  ONE OF TWO SCREWS THAT SECURES THE LOOPED BUCKLE STRAP TO THE UNDERNEATH SIDE OF THE PLASTIC SEAT CAME OUT, ALLOWING THE BAR TO SWIVEL ON THE INTACT SCREW AND COMPLETELY RELEASING THE LOOPED BUCKLE STRAP.  THE STRAP HOLDS THE BUCKLE THAT ATTACHES TO THE LATCH AND SECURES THE CHILD IN PLACE.  BECAUSE OF THE BUCKLE STRAP COMING LOOSE, THE CHILD WAS NOT RESTRAINED.  THE SCREW MUST HAVE OUT WHILE WE WERE DRIVING, AFTER WE HAD SECURED OUR CHILD.  THE BUCKLE STRAP I AM DESCRIBING CAN BE SEEN IN PICTURE 14C ON PAGE 14 OF THE INSTRUCTION BOOKLET # 4358-3056.      WE HAVE ADDITIONAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE CAR SEAT'S DESIGN, INCLUDING HOW EASILY THE BELTS TWIST WHERE THEY GO OVER THE SHOULDER AND ALSO WHERE THEY GO THROUGH THE SLOTS IN THE TOP AND BOTTOM LATCH PLATES.  THIS PROBLEM HAS MADE IT DIFFICULT TO TIGHTEN THE STRAPS ADEQUATELY PRIOR TO THE CAR SEAT FAILURE DESCRIBED ABOVE.    INCIDENT DATE WAS 1/5/03, BUT THE SITE DOES NOT PERMIT THE NEW YEAR.",
