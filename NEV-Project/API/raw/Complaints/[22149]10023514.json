THE DEALER, GALEANA KIA, SAYS THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR, JUST BRAKE DUST.  THEY'VE TRIED TO FIX IT, BUT THE PROBLEM COMES BACK. KIA GAVE ME 500 DOLLARS (CUSTOMER SATISFACTION MONEY) AND THEY SAID THEY'D FIX THE PROBLEM.  I TOOK THE MONEY, BUT THE PROBLEM CONTINUES. DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  BOUGHT CAR WITH 18 MILES ON IT... AND STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS RIGHT AWAY.  CAR NOW HAS 20 THOUSAND MILES.    *NLM",
