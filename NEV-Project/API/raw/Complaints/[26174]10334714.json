THIS FAILURE IS NOT DUE TO AN ACCIDENT WITH THE TRUCK NOR HAS THE BRAKE LINE BEEN CRUSHED DUE TO RUNNING OVER A LARGE OBSTRUCTION.  THE BRAKE  LINE IS LOCATED ABOVE THE VEHICLE FRAME RAIL.  NO ACCIDENT OCCURRED DUE TO THIS FAILURE AS IT HAPPENED WHILE EXITING MY DRIVEWAY. I MANAGED TO STOP THE TRUCK USING MY EMERGENCY BRAKE. I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A CURRENT INVESTIGATION CONCERNING THIS PROBLEM ON CHEVY AND GM TRUCKS AND SUVS.  I WENT TO MY LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALERS SERVICE DEPARTMENT BUT WAS INFORMED THAT AS THERE IS NO RECALL THE EXPENSE WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY GM. *TR",
