MILEAGE AT TIME OF NHTSA COMPLAINT - 1550.    PROBLEM:  DOOR \"RATTLE\" UNDER ANY DRIVING CONDITION.  THE \"RATTLING\" WAS FIRST THOUGHT TO BE THE PANELING.  TEFLON TAPE WAS PLACED BETWEEN THE METAL PART AND THE PLASTIC PANELING.  THIS PROCEDURE STOPPED THE PANELING FROM MAKING ANY NOISE.    BUT THE PROBLEM CONTINUED.  THE NOISE \"RATTLING\" IS COMING FROM THE UPPER FRAME OF THE DOOR.  MEANING THE DOOR IS NOT CLOSING OR MEETING THE ROOF/PILLAR SECTION OF THE ROOF.  WATER PASSED THROUGH THE DOOR.  THE OTHER DAY WE HAD RAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS, AND WATER WAS COMING IN WHILE THE CAR WAS DRIVEN.    THE DEALERSHIP HAS TRIED SEVERAL APPROACHES INCLUDING THE ONE MENTIONED ABOVE.  ALSO, VW TECH SUPPORT HAS BEEN CONTATED AND SUGGESTED TO REPLACE THE DOOR STRIKERS.  DOOR STRIKERS (ALL 4) HAVE BEEN REPLACED AND NO IMPROVEMENT.  DEALERSHIP IS WAITING FOR \"VW ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT TO GET BACK FROM THE HOLIDAYS\" TO SEE WHAT STEPS TO BE TAKEN.     I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AS THE DOOR ARE NOT CLOSING PROPERLY.  IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT WILL THE DOOR HOLD IN PLACE?  WHAT HAPPENS IF I INSTALL A ROOF RACK AND PLACE A LOAD IN THE ROOF?  IS THE ROOF GOING TO GIVE IN SINCE IT IS MISSING THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FROM THE DOORS?    MY MAIN CONCERN IS IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT ARE THE DOOR GOING TO HOLD IN PLACE OR ARE THEY GOING TO FLY OF SINCE THE VIBRATION \"OPENING AND CLOSING\" THE DOORS? TS",
