THE DEALERSHIP CHARGED ME $40.00 TO LOOK AT THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS AND TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD NOT HONOR THE RECALL BECAUSE ANOTHER PERSON HAD TAKEN THE CAR IN BEFORE ME AND HAD ALREADY FIXED THE RECALL.        IF A RECALL IS PLACED ON A ITEM AND THE DEALERSHIP FIXES THE ITEM WITH ANOTHER FAULTY ITEM SHOULDN'T THEY BE RESPONSIBLE TO FIX THE PROBLEM UNTIL THEY GET IT RIGHT? SHOULD THE OWNER OF THE VEHICLE CONTINUE TO PAY TO FIX THE PROBLEM OVER AND OVER WITH A FAULTY ITEM THAT COULD ENABLE HIM TO DRIVE HIS VEHICLE IN A SAFE MANNER? I HOPE THIS IS NOT THE CASE.
