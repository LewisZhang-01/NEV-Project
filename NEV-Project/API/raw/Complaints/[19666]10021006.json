I WAS IN THE LANE INSIDE THE FAST LANE, BUT MOVING AT THE SAME SPEED AS TRAFFIC. I WAS ABLE TO NAVIGATE TO THE SHOULDER AND CHANGE THE TIRE. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE TIRE EXPLODED AND WRAPPED ITSELF AROUND THE AXLE, THE RIM WAS DESTROYED. I HAVE ORDERED ANOTHER RIM FROM A RE-MANUFACTURER.  I'VE E-MAILED FIRESTONE WITH THE INCIDENT INFORMATION, BUT HAVE RECEIVED NO RESPONSE.   *NLM",
