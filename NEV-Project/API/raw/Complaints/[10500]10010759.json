MINE HAS A 6.0 LITER V-8, BUT I KNOW SEVERAL PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT ENGINES AND MODEL YEARS WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. THE PEDAL STICKS SO HARD THAT IT TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT TO MAKE IT RELEASE RESULTING IN LARGE BURST OF SPEED AND LOSS OF CONTROL. THE DEALERS REFUSE TO CORRECT EXCEPT UNDER WARRANTY WHICH I NO LONGER HAVE. THE FACTORY KNOWS THERE IS A PROBLEM AND DEALERS ACKNOWLEDGE AS WELL BUT WILL NOT CORRECT WITHOUT BEING PAID. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM. WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL NEAR MISSES.   *NLM",
