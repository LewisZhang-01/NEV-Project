AFTER THE SERVICE A MONTH AGO, I STILL HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  TOOK IT BACK TWICE AND WAS TOLD EVERYTHING CHECKED OUT FINE.  THE SECOND TIME I SAID I WAS NOT PICKING UP THE CAR UNTIL IT WAS FIXED.  THAT'S WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL BEARING AND THE IDLER PULLEY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  IT WAS COVERED BY WARANTY.  BUT I AM STILL HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE FRONT END - A SLIGHT WOBBLE AROUND 65 TO 70 MPH.",
