VW IN CHARLESTON, SC, HAS HAD CAR DOZEN PLUS TIMES, AND NEVER FOUND PROBLEM.  MECHANIC CHECKED FUEL SYSTEM, ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, CODES PRESENTED, WENT THROUGH TECHNICAL MANUALS.  ALSO MANY ELECTRICAL PARTS, I.E., DISTRIBUTOR, FUEL PUMP, MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR, ECG, ETC., WERE REPLACED.  CAR HAS BEEN TOTALLY UNRELIABLE SINCE THAT POINT.  YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT'S GOING TO DIE OUT.  HAPPENED TO US ON I-95; 18-WHEELER HAD TO SWERVE TO PREVENT ACCIDENT.  CAR NOW SITTING IN DRIVEWAY.  FROM WHAT I CAN FIND ON THE INTERNET, MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM.   *NM",
