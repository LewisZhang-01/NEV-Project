THE DEALER HAS TRIED MANY THINGS TO MAKE THIS REPAIR WHEN UNDER WARRANTY SUCH AS REPLACING THE DRAIN BOLT, NEW OIL FILTERS, AND REPLACEMENT OF THE OIL LEVEL SENSOR TO NO AVAIL.  NOW THAT THE WARRANTY IS OFF, THEY INFORM ME THAT THE OIL IS LEAKING FROM THE \"HALF CASE\" AND WILL REQUIRE THAT THE ENGINE BE PULLED AT A COST OF BETWEEN $1800 AND $2000.  I AM TOLD THAT CADILLAC IS HAVING TO MAKE THIS REPAIR TO MOST NORTHSTAR ENGINES AT ABOUT 50,000 MILES. MINE HAS 65,000.   *NLM",
