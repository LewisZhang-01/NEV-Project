THULE'S INSTRUCTIONS WERE TO CONTACT THEM AT A TOLL-FREE PHONE NUMBER FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON OBTAINING A REPAIR KIT TO ELIMINATE THE HAZARD.  THULE ALSO PROVIDED A WEB SITE FOR OBTAINING INFORMATION.  I PHONED THE TOLL-FREE NUMBER, LISTENED TO A LENGTHY RECORDED MASSAGE, THEN PRESSED \"1\" AS INSTRUCTED.  MY PHONE CONNECT THEN WENT INTO LIMBO WITH NO RESPONSE FROM THULE.  I HAVE TRIED THE CALL SEVERAL TIMES WITH THE SAME RESULT.  I ALSO CHECKED THE THULE WEB SITE, BUT I FIND THE LINKS TO INFORMATION ON HOW TO PROCEED TO BE INOPERATIVE.  CLEARLY THULE IS NOT PROPERLY HANDLING THIS RECALL BECAUSE I AM UNABLE TO MAKE ANY MEANINGFUL CONTACT TO OBTAIN THE NEEDED REPAIR KIT.*JB",
