AT THIS POINT A DRIVER PULLED UP ALONG SIDE THE CAR AND YELLED \"YOUR CAR IS ON FIRE\".  THE DRIVER OF THE MYSTIQUE THEN PULLED TO THE SHOULDER AND THE CAR WAS ENGULFED IN FLAMES ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  I IMMEDIATELY EXITED THE CAR WHILE HEARING A WOMAN SCREAM \"IT'S GOING TO EXPLODE\".  I SUFFERED 2ND DEGREE BURNS ON MY FACE,RIGHT EAR, RIGHT ARM, RIGHT LEG AND ISOLATED 3RD DEGREE ON MY RIGHT KNUCKLES.  I ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT AN ATTORNEY BUT HE EVENTUALLY QUIT THE CASE.  I DON'T THINK THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY MEDICAL BILLS FROM THIS FIRE.  THE DRIVER WAS UNHURT BUT HIS CAR WAS BURNT TO A HUNK OF BLACK METAL.   *NLM",
