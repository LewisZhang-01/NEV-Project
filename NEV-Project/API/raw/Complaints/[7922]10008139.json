DURING VARIOUS TIRE ROTATIONS AT A QUALIFIED SERVICE CENTER, SIX STUDS HAVE BROKEN (TWICE AT THE DEALER).  I'M REALLY WORRIED THAT AT SOME POINT A WHEEL MAY COME OFF WHILE I'M DRIVING.    SECOND, THE DRIVERS POWER ADJUST SEAT ROCKS BACK AND FORTH DURING BRAKING & ACCELERATION.  THIS IS ANNOYING AND I'M AFRAID THAT EVENTUALLY, IT'S GOING TO BREAK ALL THE WAY LOOSE.*JB",
