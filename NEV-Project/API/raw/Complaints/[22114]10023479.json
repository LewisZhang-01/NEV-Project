I TOOK MY COMPLAINT TO THE TOYOTA DEALER, AND THEY SAID THAT THE TIRES WERE \"PERFORMANCE\" TIRES AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS HELP ME GET A DISCOUNT ON ANOTHER SET OF TIRES. THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, AS THIS TYPE OF (FAMILY) CAR SHOULD NOT HAVE COME EQUIPPED WITH A DANGEROUS TIRE. I COMPLAINED TO THE BRIDGESTONE DEALER AS WELL, AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THESE WERE VERY HARD TIRES, AND ARE THE TYPE  THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE PUT ON A CORVETTE, OR SIMILAR SPORTS CAR. I WAS FORCED TO REPLACE THE TIRES AT MY EXPENSE, WITH ONLY 21,000 MILES ON THEM. THE CAR WOULD NOT STOP IN THE SNOW, AND WOULD SLIP AT TAKEOFF IN THE RAIN AS WELL. THESE TIRES SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN PUT ON THIS CAR. I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT TOYOTA WOULD PUT THIS TYPE OF TIRE ON A CAMRY.    *NLM",
