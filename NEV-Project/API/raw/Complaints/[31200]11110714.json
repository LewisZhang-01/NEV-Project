        "summary": "I PURCHASED MY 2018 TIGUAN ON JUNE 26TH, 2018. ON JUNE 27TH, AS I WAS DRIVING ON THE EXPRESSWAY I HEARD A LOUD RATTLING NOISE COMING FROM THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR . THE MORE I DROVE THE LOUDER IT WAS . I DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT WAS COMING FROM. I WAS HEADED TO THE DEALERSHIP ANYWAY BECAUSE MY CAR WAS MISSING 3 ITEMS FROM THE TRUCK. THE PAINT PROTECTOR WASN'T DONE PROPERLY AND THE INSIDE OF THE CAR WASN'T CLEAN. I SPOKE WITH MY SALES PERSON ONCE I ARRIVED AND WE WENT TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT TO GET THE CAR RE-DETAILED INSIDE AND OUT ALONG WITH THEM CHECKING OUT THE NOISE I WAS HEARING. THURSDAY JUNE 29, 10 AM, I ARRIVED AND CHECKED MY VEHICLE IN. I WAS TOLD IT WOULD TAKE A COUPLE OF HOURS TO COMPLETE EVERYTHING. IT TOOK 5 HOURS AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE SHIFT PLATE UNDER THE PASSENGER SEAT WAS LOOSE AND IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT 3 TO 4 DAYS FOR THE PART TO ARRIVE. I RECEIVED A CALL ON JULY 5TH, STATING THE PART CAME IN AND I WAS SCHEDULED TO COME BACK IN ON SATURDAY JULY 9TH AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE A TECHNICIAN RIDE WITH ME , SINCE I WAS HEARING THE NOISE FROM THE SEAT BELT PANEL ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CAR. WHEN I ARRIVED, THE TECHNICIAN RODE WITH ME TO HEAR THE NOISE AND HE AGREED THAT IT WAS COMING FROM THE SEAT BELT PANEL. TECHNICIAN DROVE 2 OTHER DEMO CARS SINCE MY CAR WAS DRIVEN BY THE OWNER. FAST-FORWARD, I WAS TOLD THE DEMO CARS SOUNDED THE SAME WAY AND THAT HE TOOK THE SEAT BELT PANEL OFF, REARRANGED SOMETHING , DROVE THE CAR AND DIDN'T HEAR THE NOISE. THE SERVICE PERSON EXPLAINED THAT IF I STILL HEARD THE NOISE THAT IT WAS NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE AND I HAD TO DEAL WITH THE NOISE. SINCE MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS WITH ME , I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO GO BACK AND FORTH, I SAID OK AND REPORTED THIS ISSUE TO VOLKSWAGEN.",
