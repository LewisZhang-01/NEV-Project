THANKFULLY I WAS PULLING INTO MY PARKING SPACE AT WORK AND WAS NOT DRIVING ON A ROAD OR TRAVELING AT A HIGHER RATE OF SPEED.  I HAVE THE OLD PART AND WAS TOLD BY THE MECHANIC WHO IS FIXING THE VEHICLE TO REPORT THE INCIDENT AS IN THEIR OPINION IT IS A MECHANICAL DEFECT THAT MAY HAVE HAD DEADLY CONSEQUENCE.  MY VEHICLE IS A 1998 FORD F150 AND HAS APPROX 99,000 MILES ON IT.  ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE IS OLDER, IT CERTAINLY IS NOT THE OLDEST VEHICLE ON THE ROAD AND I HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED IT AND HAVE NEVER USED THE VEHICLE FOR ANY OFF ROAD OR HARD USE.  *TR",
