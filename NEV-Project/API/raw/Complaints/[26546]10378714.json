        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 2011 MALIBU FROM CHAMPION CHEVROLET IN AUSTIN, TX IN NOVEMBER 2010. THE CAR WAS DELIVERED TO ME WITH A KNOWN DEFECTIVE EBCM (ELECTRONIC BRAKE CONTROL MODULE). THEY HAD THE PART ON ORDER AND DIDN'T TELL ME. I FOUND OUT A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER WHEN I HAD A TRACTION CONTROL FAILURE INDICATION AND WAS INFORMED THAT IT WOULD CONTINUE TO FAIL UNTIL THE MODULE WAS REPLACED. THE MODULE WAS REPLACED AND STILL HAD A TRACTION CONTROL/ABS FAILURE. LATER I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALER. THE CONNECTOR ON THE EBCM HAD A PUSHED PIN FROM THE MODULE REPLACEMENT. THE CAR WAS KEPT THERE A WEEK LOOKING FOR THE TRACTION CONTROL/ABS FAILURE AND A HYDRAULIC PRESSURE CONTROL MODULE WAS REPLACED. THIS LEFT THE BRAKES FEELING SOFT/MUSHY..MORE TRAVEL.  TRIED TO GET A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE BUT DEALER WOULDN'T HELP ME UNLESS I WAS WILLING TO TAKE A $6000 LOST ON THE MONTH OLD MALIBU. COMPLAINED TO GM BUT ALL THEY SAID WAS THAT THE DEALER FIXED THE CAR. OFFERED SOME OIL CHANGES. IN JANUARY DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE HIT ON THIS MALIBU AND BECAUSE OF CURRENT INCENTIVES TRADED IT FOR ANOTHER MALIBU.  *TR",
