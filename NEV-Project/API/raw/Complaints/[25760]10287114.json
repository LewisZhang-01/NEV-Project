ABOUT A MONTH AGO, WE STARTED EXPERIENCING TRANSMISSION TROUBLE - VERY SLUGGISH SHIFTING, AND SLIPPAGE BETWEEN 2ND AND 3RD GEARS, AND HEAVY SHAKING/VIBRATION OF THE CAR (UNTIL THEN IT HAS BEEN A FANTASTIC VEHICLE).  I GOOGLED IT AND FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS UNDER A RECALL.  HOWEVER, WHEN I CALLED THE LOCAL ACURA DEALER, WE WERE TOLD WE WERE BEYOND THE 7 YR WINDOW, EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE LESS THAN THE 100K LIMIT ON THE WARRANTY. *TR",
