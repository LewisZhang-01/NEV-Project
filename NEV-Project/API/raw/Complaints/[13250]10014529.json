THEY FINALLY AUTHORIZED THE DEALERSHIP TO DROP THE TRANSMISSION PAN AND THEY FOUND METAL SHARDS IN IT FROM THE TRANSMISSION.  I  HAD THE MOLDING AROUND THE REAR WINDOW REPLACE, BOTH ELECTRIC MIRRORS FIXED BECAUSE THEY GET \"STUCK.\"  THE IGNITION HAS BEEN REPLACED THREE TIMES SINCE I GOT THE CAR, TWICE IN THE LAST 4 WEEKS.  THE KEY WILL NOT TURN IN THE IGNITION AND THE STEERING WHEEL IS NOT LOCKED.  THIS REALLY AFFECTS THE USAGE OF THE CAR.  I AM WAITING TO GET STRANDED SOMEWHERE BECAUSE THE CAR WON'T START.  I HAVE SPOKEN TO A PONTIAC REP SEVERAL TIMES, BEEN LIED TO AND BRUSHED ASIDE.   *JB",
