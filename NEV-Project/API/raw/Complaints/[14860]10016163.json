WHEN I PARKED THE CAR AT HOME, I NOTICED THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE WAS VISIBLY SAGGING.  I TOOK IT TO MY MECHANIC AND HE SAID THE TORSION BAR HAD BROKE.  HE ALSO SAID THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM IN THIS YEAR OF VEHICLE.  I CALLED GENERAL MOTORS TO SEE IF THERE WAS A RECALL CAMPAIGN AND THERE IS NOT.   I HAVE TO BUY TWO NEW TORSION BARS BECAUSE THERE IS AN UPDATE TO THE VERSION.  THE REPAIRS ARE $700.00.   *NLM",
