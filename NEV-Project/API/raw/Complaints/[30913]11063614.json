        "summary": "ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2016, I LEASED A NEW 2016 BUICK ENVISION, SOLELY TO GET UPDATED SAFETY TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS NOT ON MY 6-YEAR OLD BUICK REGAL.  I HAD SEEN THE ENVISION AT CAR SHOWS, HAD PICKED UP SALES LITERATURE THERE AND AT LOCAL DEALERSHIP, PLUS RECEIVED ONLINE INFORMATION.  THIS VEHICLE WAS ADVERTISED AS HAVING FRONT END COLLISION ALERT WITH AUTOMATIC BRAKING. IN APRIL 2017, I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM BUICK/GM THAT MY VEHICLE DOESN'T HAVE THE AUTO BRAKING AND THERE HAD BEEN AN ERROR IN THEIR SALES PRODUCTS.  I IMMEDIATELY WROTE TO THEM.  A COUPLE MONTHS LATER I RECEIVED A CALL OFFERING ME 1 YEAR OF ONSTAR, 1 YEAR EXTENSION OF WARRANTY, OR $1500 ACCESSORIES CERTIFICATE.  I EXPLAINED THAT I DON'T USE ONSTAR, THE EXISTING WARRANTY RUNS THE LENGTH OF MY LEASE, AND THAT THERE IS NO NEED FOR $1500 ACCESSORIES ON A FULLY-LOADED $48000 CAR.  SO I WROTE ANOTHER LETTER, TO WHICH THERE WAS NO RESPONSE UNTIL I FILED A CLAIM WITH THE OHIO ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.  AGAIN I WAS OFFERED THE SAME 3 SELECTIONS FOR MY \"INCONVENIENCE\".  THIS ISN'T AN INCONVENIENCE.  IT COULD BE A LIFE AND DEATH SITUATION.  THE FRONT END BRAKING WAS THE MAIN REASON FOR PURCHASING THIS VEHICLE.  IT SEEMS FALSE ADVERTISING REQUIRES MORE THAN A LETTER.",
