THE SERVICE TECH SAID IMMEDIATELY THAT IT WAS BAD WIRING IN THE ABS MOTOR CAUSING IT TO RUN AT ALL TIMES.  THIS WAS A REPAIR THAT NEEDED TO BE COMPLETED IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE THE MOTOR WAS RUNNING OFF OF MY BATTERY.  THE DEALER SAID THAT HE HAS SEEN A FEW OF THESE VEHICLES WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  I PROCEEDED WITH THE REPAIR AND SPENT ABOUT 900.00.  THIS IS NOT A RECALL, AT LEAST I AM NOT AWARE OF IT, AND SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED.  *JB",
