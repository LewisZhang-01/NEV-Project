AT 7 AM THE FOLLOWING MORNING I CALLED HIGHWOOD AUTO WHICH IS VERY CLOSE TO ME AND SOMEONE CAME AND TOWED THE CAR TO THE SHOP.  THEY LATER CALLED TO SAY IT WAS A TRANSMISSION LEAK AND I SHOULD CALL SATURN.  UPON OF EXPLAINING MY SITUATION TO SATURN OF PARAMUS THEY TOLD ME MY WARRANTY WAS EXPIRED AND SUGGESTED I TRADE IN THE CAR FOR A NEW ONE.  I LIVE IN AN AREA WHERE I NEED A CAR AT ALL TIMES AND SO I TOLD HIGHWOOD AUTO TO INVESTIGATE THE LEAK FURTHER.  THEY TOOK THE CAR APART AND FOUND THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAS A HOLE.  I CALLED SATURN CORPORATION AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THAT WAS UNUSUAL AND THAT THEY COULD ASSIST ME, BUT ONLY IF A SATURN TECHNICIAN LOOKS AT THE CAR.  SATURN OF PARAMUS SAID THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE THE CAR TAKEN TO THEM INTACT.  THIS WAS NOT POSSIBLE, SO I WENT AHEAD AND INSTRUCTED HIGHWOOD AUTO TO FIX MY CAR, AS I LIVE IN AN AREA WHERE I NEED ONE.",
