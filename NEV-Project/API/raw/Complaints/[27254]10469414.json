MINE IS LIKE MANY OTHERS FIRST THE BRAKE SYSTEM LOCKED UP AND COST $300 TO REPAIR AND NOW THE CARE WILL NOT START OR STARTS WHEN IT WANTS TO. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND THEY NOW SAY IT IS THE KEY SWITCH (ELECTRICAL) AND WILL NOW BE A $400 BILL OUT OF MY POCKET. NO COVERAGE WARRANTY IS UP, PURCHASED USED AND WAS NOT TOLD THAT THEIR WAS A RECALL ON THE CARE WHEN WE PURCHASED IT.    DODGE KNOWS THIS CAR HAS PROBLEMS BUT LIKE NORMAL THEY WILL NOT RECALL THE CAR AND FIX THEIR PROBLEMS, THEY WILL HOWEVER ALLOW THE CARE TO BE ON THE ROAD AND SERVICE THEM OVER AND OVER BECAUSE IT MAKES THEM MONEY. THE CLAIMS OF DODGE IS FALSE, THIS CAR IS NOT A QUALITY CAR AND MANY OWNERS HAVE REPORTED THE MANY PROBLEMS.  *TR",
