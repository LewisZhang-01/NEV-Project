I THEN LOST ALL POWER STEERING IN MY VEHICLE.  THIS MADE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO STEER AND OPERATE SAFELY.  LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE OFF THE HIGHWAY SAFELY. THE NEXT DAY, I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MY DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THE POWER STEERING TORQUE SENSOR NEEDS REPLACED.  I DID RESEARCH AND DISCOVERED THAT A SIMILAR RECALL WAS ISSUED FOR THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING ON 2009 MALIBU'S , BUT MY VIN WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  I AM UNCLEAR AS TO WHY.  I CONTACTED GM/CHEVROLET AND WAS TOLD I AM NOT COVERED AND AM NOW HOLDING A BILL FOR ALMOST $600.  I WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT MY VEHICLE WAS NOT COVERED.  ADDITIONALLY, I WAS NOT EVEN AWARE THAT MY VEHICLE DID NOT HAVE HYDRAULIC POWER STEERING.    *TR",
