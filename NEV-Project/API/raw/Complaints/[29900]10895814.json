THE LETTER STATED WE NEEDED TO CONTACT OUR CHRYSLER DEALER AND SCHEDULE A APPOINTMENT AS TO BE SURE THEY HAD THE PARTS TO FIX IT. WE CALLED AUGUST 10 AND WERE TOLD TO HAVE JEEP ON THERE LOT AT 9 A.M. ON AUGUST 13 AND THEY WOULD HAVE THE PARTS THERE TO FIX IT. THIS WAS CUMBERLAND CHRYSLER, COOKEVILLE TENNESSEE. WE ARRIVED ON TIME AND DROPPED IT OFF AND WERE TOLD IT WOULD TAKE ABOUT 3 HOURS TO FIX. AT 11:10 SOMEONE FROM THE DEALERSHIP CALLED AND TOLD US THEY DID'NT HAVE THE PARTS! MY WIFE AND I GOT UP EARLY ON A SATURDAY MORNING TO HAVE THE JEEP ON THERE LOT BY 9 AND THIS IS WHAT WE GET! ALSO WHY CALL AND MAKE AN APPOINTMENT IF THE DEALERSHIP IS NOT GOING TO KEEP IT.  THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO START ON IT AT 9 A.M. AND DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO START UNTIL 11:10! JUST WANTED TO GIVE CHRYSLER A HEADS UP ABOUT THIS DEALERSHIP AND TO INFORM THEM TO NOT PAY THEM FOR FIXING THIS VEHICLE! JUST IN CASE THEY SUMMIT A CLAIM BECAUSE THEY DID NOT DO ANYTHING. AGAIN THE DEALERSHIP WAS CUMBERLAND CHRYSLER, COOKEVILLE TENNESSEE. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.",
