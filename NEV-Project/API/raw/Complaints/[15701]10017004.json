WHILE DRIVING ON THE EXPRESSWAY MAY 4, 2003 (AT 55 MPH), TRANSMISSION FAILED, CAUSING A VERY VIOLENT FORWARD JERK.   AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH, I FOUND THAT THIS SEEMS TO BE A SOMEWHAT FREQUENT OCCURRENCE IN THIS MODEL.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS SITUATION BEFORE SOMEONE GETS SEVERELY INJURED.  THIS OCCURRED 2 DAYS AFTER HAVING THE RECALLED REPAIR DONE TO THE RACK & PINION STEERING.  *JB",
