DUE TO MOISTURE IN THE COIL, THE CAR WAS BARELY RUNNING -- IT BACK FIRED, AND WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET IT ROLLING UP A HILL, ALMOST CAUSING ME TO ROLL INTO A CAR BEHIND ME AT A STOP SIGN. I WAS ABLE TO GET IT REPLACED UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY, BUT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY THE RECALL ON ALL THE OTHER COILS -- THERE ARE NUMEROUS REPORTS OF 2000 MODELS WITH THE VR6 ENGINE HAVING THE SAME COIL FAILURE.  *JB",
