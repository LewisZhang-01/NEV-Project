NOW THE PROBLEM HAS ESCALATED TO THE POINT OF PARTS OF MY DASH BOARD IS ACTUALLY FALLING OUT. IT IS CRACKED OVER THE ENTIRE DASH BOARD AND IS STARTING TO SPREAD FUTHER. I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS PROBLEM ISN'T GOING TO STOP UNTIL MY DASH BOARD IS FALLING IN MY LAP. THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS, A 2000 MODEL VEHICLE THAT I PAID OVER $20,000 FOR SHOULD NOT BE HAVING THIS PROBLEM IN ONLY 3 YEARS! SOMEONE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PROBLEM AND IT SHOULDN'T BE ME!   *AK",
