I PURCHASED IT USED SEPT. 2002.  I CURRENTLY HAVE 46201 MILES ON THE CAR AND BY LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION ON YOU WEBSITE SEE THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY INDIVIDUAL TO HAVE THESE PROBLEMS.  MY REAR DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW IS NOT WORKING.  IT WORKED WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR, BUT NOW IT DOESN'T EVEN GO DOWN.  I AM HAVING IT REPLACED, BUT AM NOT HAPPY THAT A CAR ONLY 3 YEARS OF AGE HAS SUCH A PROBLEM.  I HAVE ALREADY DONE MY RESEARCH AND HAVE REALIZED THAT I HAVE PURCHASED A CAR WITH NUMEROUS PROBLEMS.  ALSO, THE FRONT PASSENGER DOOR LOCK MECHANISM (ACTUATOR) ALSO HAS TO BE REPLACED.  IT IS CURRENTLY MAKING A VERY LOUD PITCHED NOISE WHEN ACTIVATING THE LOCKING FEATURE.  THE UNLOCK DOESN'T MAKE THE NOISE.  I WOULD APPRECIATE A RESPONSE ABOUT THIS INFORMATION.  I WILL ALSO BE CONTACTING THE NHTSA ABOUT THESE ISSUES SO THEY ARE AWARE OF THEM.  WHEN AT THE DEALER TODAY, 4/8/2003, THE SERVICE PERSON SAID THAT THE DOOR LOCK MECHANISM HAS BEEN A CONSISTENT PROBLEM.  I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT I WILL BE PURCHASING OR PERSUADING AN INDIVIDUAL TO PURCHASE A CHRYSLER PRODUCT.  SINCERELY, [XXX].     *NLM    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
