        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING MY 1992 FORD RANGER XLT PICK-UP TRUCK THE DRIVERS SEAT MECHANISM WITHOUT WARNING OR ANY ACTION TO INITIATE THE FAILURE EMITTED A NOISE AND SUDDENLY FAILED.  MY TORSO IMMEDIATELY FELL BACKWARDS AS THE DRIVERS SEAT RECLINED COMPLETELY.  FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE AND AVOID ANY ACCIDENT, COLLISION OR INJURY SAVE FOR A BIT OF A STRAIN ON MY ABDOMINAL MUSCLES WHICH WAS NOT SERIOUS.  THE SEAT WILL NOT RETURN AND STAY IN THE UPRIGHT POSITION NOR WILL IT LATCH DOWN SECURELY (TO PREVENT FROM SLIDING FORWARDS AND BACKWARDS).  THE FAILURE HAS RENDERED THE VEHICLE UNUSABLE WITHOUT REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF THE DRIVERS SEAT.  I AM CONCERNED THAT SHOULD THE FAILURE HAVE OCCURRED AT ANY OTHER TIME I MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE AND SERIOUS INJURY OR DAMAGE COULD HAVE OCCURRED.  IF THIS EVENT CAN HAPPEN IN OTHER SUCH VEHICLES OWNERS SHOULD BE WARNED TO INSPECT THIS MECHANISM FOR WEAR OR WHATEVER CAUSED IT TO FAIL.  ALSO I AM RELUCTANT TO HAVE IT REPAIRED BY REPLACING IT WITH A USED SEAT SINCE A USED PART MAY BE JUST AS UNRELIABLE.  I UNDERSTAND THAT NEW PARTS ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE FROM FORD IN ORDER TO REPLACE THE INOPERATIVE DRIVERS SEAT. *JB",
