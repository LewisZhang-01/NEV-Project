        "summary": "I HAVE A 1998 CHEVY MALIBU WITH 60,000 MILES. THE PROBLEM STARTED AT ABOUT 50,000 MILES. BOTH FRONT LOWER CONTROL ARMS STARTED TO RATTLE OVER CRACKS AND BUMPS AROUND JULY 2001. IT HAS STEADILY BECOME WORSE AND IS TO THE POINT I CAN HEAR A LOUD CLUNK EVEN OVER EXPANSION JOINTS OR WHEN IT SHIFTS GEARS DURING ACCELERATION. I HAVE HEARD FROM SEVERAL OTHER OWNERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM, SOME WITH FEWER MILES. IN ALL CASES CHEVROLET REFUSES TO TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY AND SAYS WE HAVE TO REPLACE WITH NEWLY DESIGNED CONTROL ARMS AT OUR OWN COST. I AM GOING TO REPLACE THEM FOR FEAR THAT THE BOLTS ARE GOING TO BREAK FROM THE EXCESSIVE MOVEMENT ALLOWED BY THE INFERIOR BUSHINGS USED IN THE ORIGINAL PART, BUT I THINK GM'S DECISION TO NOT RECALL THIS OBVIOUS SAFETY HAZARD SHOULD BE QUESTIONED. THEY HAVE ADMITTED THERE WAS A DESIGN FLAW BY PRODUCING A REDISIGNED PART, WHY SHOULD THEY NOT RECALL IT?",
