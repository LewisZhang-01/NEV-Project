        "summary": "OUR '98 FORD WINDSTAR (3.8L) HAS JUST EXPERIENCED A MAJOR TRANSMISSION PROBLEM; IT DRIVES ALONG JUST FINE ON THE HIGHWAY AT 65 M.P.H. AND THEN BANG -- THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTS FROM OVER DRIVE INTO SECOND (OR FIRST!) GEAR.  THIS SENDS THE ENGINE FROM A CASUAL 1,500 R.P.M. TO A DANGEROUS 5,500 R.P.M., AND MAKES FOR SCARY AND DANGEROUS HIGHWAY DRIVING.  FORD (KACHEL FORD IN SHILLINGTON, PA) SAYS THAT THE VALVE BODY OR POSSIBLY THE ENTIRE TRANSMISSION HAS GONE BAD, BUT I HAVE UNCOVERED LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS VERY SAME, AND POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING PROBLEM WITH THE FORD AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION BEING USED IN THE WINDSTAR.  SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS IMMEDIATELY.  CONTACT ME AT ONCE IF YOU WOULD LIKE FULL COOPERATION -- I AM WILLING.    *NLM",
