I HAVE NOT REPLACED IT AS OF YET. I CALLED FORD ON 11-24-05 AFTER HEARING ABOUT A RECALL TO SEE IF IT WAS COVERED YET AND IT'S NOT. FORD CUSTOMER HOTLINE TOLD ME THAT I WOULD HAVE TO COVER THE COST OF THE PARTS AND REPAIR BECAUSE THE FRONT COILS ARE THE ONLY ONES COVERED BY THE RECALL. I ASKED, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FRONT COILS AND THE BACK? SHE COULDN'T ANSWER IT. I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY WHEN THIS HAPPENED I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY DIDN'T HIT ANY BUMPS OR ANYTHING. IT JUST BROKE! THANK GOD I MADE IT HOME WITHOUT AN ACCIDENT.*JB",
