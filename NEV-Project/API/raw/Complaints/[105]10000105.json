WIPERS WILL SOMETIMES ACTIVATE ON THEIR OWN. INTERMITTENT WIPERS WILL SOMETIMES BEGIN TO CYCLE AND CONTINUE CYCLING EVEN AFTER THE SWITCH HAS BEEN TURNED TO THE \"OFF\" POSITION IN DESPERATION.  WE LIVE IN THE PACIFIC NW AND HAVE TO DRIVE IN RAIN CONSTANTLY.  NOT HAVING RELIABLE WINDSHIELD WIPERS IS EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS.  WE HAVE HAD THE CAR TO A DEALER TWICE AND HAD THE SWITCH REPLACED TWICE WITHIN ONE YEAR.  PER THE DEALER, THE SWITCH WAS DEFECTIVE BOTH TIMES.  WHILE DRIVING HOME FROM THE DEALER AFTER HAVING THE SWITCH REPLACED THE SECOND TIME, THE PROBLEM OCCURRED AGAIN BUT BY THE TIME WE TURNED AROUND AND GOT BACK TO THE DEALER, IT WAS WORKING FINE SO THE DEALER COULD NOT DIAGNOSE ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS.",
