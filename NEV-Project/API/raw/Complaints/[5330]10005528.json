I WAS DRIVING HOME AND THE ABS LIGHT CAME ON, AND I NOTICED A HUMMING NOISE, EVEN AFTER THE IGNITION WAS TURNED OFF. I HAD TO REMOVE THE 60 AMP FUSE FROM THE FUSE CENTER TO TURN OFF THE ABS MODULE. MY MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THE REPAIR COST IS APPROXIMATELY $1000. I CAN'T AFFORD THE REPAIR COST AND NOW I AM DRIVING WITHOUT ABS. THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE SILVERADOS AND GM IS NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT. MY MECHANIC SAID THAT WHEN HE CALLED THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM TO THEM THEY IMMEDIATELY TOLD HIM IT WAS THE MODULE.  THEY SAID THAT THEY KEEP NO LESS THAN 3 IN STOCK AT ANYTIME BECAUSE THEY GO OUT SO OFTEN. IF THIS IS THE CASE WHY HASN'T GM LOOKED INTO IT.  WHEN YOU PAY $30,000 FOR A VEHICLE YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SPEND ANOTHER $1,000 FOR ONE PART TO KEEP IT ON THE ROAD.DL",
