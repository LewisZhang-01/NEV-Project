        "summary": "THE BRAKE LINES THAT RUN BETWEEN THE MASTER CYLINDER AND PROPORTIONING VALVE ARE ROUTED PAST THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD HEAT SHIELD RETAINING CLAMP. THE RETAINING CLAMP HAS A BOLT THAT PROTRUDES UP AT ABOUT A 75 DEGREE ANGLE FROM HORIZONTAL. THE BRAKE LINES WERE ROUTED PAST THIS BOLT AND SO CLOSE THAT THEY WERE RUBBING UP AGAINST IT. OVER A PERIOD OF TIME(14,050 MILES) THIS CONTACT CAUSED BRAKE FAILURE DUE TO A HOLE WORN IN THE BRAKE LINE TUBING FROM CONSTANT FRICTION. THERE HAS BEEN NO REPAIRS OR MODIFICATIONS OF FACTORY INSTALLED EQUIPMENT OF THE BRAKING SYSTEM OR ANY OTHER SYSTEM ON THIS VEHICLE. FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NOT A ACCIDENT CAUSED BY THIS INCIDENT. I BELIEVE THIS COULD BE A POTENTIAL SAFETY RECALL ISSUE ON THIS VEHICLE.     *JB",
