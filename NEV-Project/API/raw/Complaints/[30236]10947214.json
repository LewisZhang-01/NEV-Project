SO FAR AS I CAN TELL IT DOES THIS WHEN SHIFTING FROM 1ST TO 2ND. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM SO THEY COULD NOT FIX IT. HAPPENS IN MOTION ON CITY STREET OR IN PARKING LOTS. I HAVE STANDARD TRANSMISSION SO WHEN IT HAPPENS I CAN LEAVE CLUTCH IN, TURN OFF ENGINE AND RESTART. PROBLEMS STARTED AT ABOUT 3,400 MILES. STILL DOING IT.",
