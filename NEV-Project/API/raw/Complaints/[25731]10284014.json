ALSO THE PASSENGER AIR BAG LIGHT ON THE MIDDLE OF THE DASHBOARD FLASHES OFF AND ON.  ONLY HAPPENS MAYBE 20% OF THE TIME.  HAVE HAD IT TO THE DEALER TWICE, THE CODES THAT COME UP THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE SO CAN'T DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. WHEN I DO TAKE IT IN MOST OF THE TIMES THE LIGHTS DON'T COME ON SO THEY ASK WHETS THE PROBLEM?  I DON'T KNOW IF THE CAR IS SAFE TO DRIVE OR NOT. *TR",
