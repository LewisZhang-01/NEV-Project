THE TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED WITH 54,202 MILES ON IT, WHICH STARTED GIVING US PROBLEMS AT ABOUT 53,000 MILES.  THE DEALERSHIP REPLACED BOTH IDLER ARMS AT 25,680 MILES.  HAD SEAT BELT CHIME FIXED (RECALL), DRIVER SEAT FEELS LOOSE WHEN STOPPING DEALERSHIP CLAIMS TO HAVE TIGHTENED IT, STILL FEELS LOOSE.  THE VAN HAS ALWAYS IDLED ROUGH TOOK IT IN 3 TIMES FOR THAT AND CAN'T SEEM TO FIX THAT.  SLIDING DOOR RATTLE THEY TRIED TO FIX THAT ALSO STILL RATTLES.  THE GAS PEDAL STICKS WHEN I TAKE OFF OR WHEN I GO IN REVERSE WHICH MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE OFF SMOOTHLY.  I HAD AN ASTRO AND A SAFARI IN THE PAST AND NEVER HAD AS MANY PROBLEMS AS I HAD WITH THIS ONE.  *JB",
