THIS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES DURING THE SAME DRIVE.  THE DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE MEC PUMP.  ABOUT ONE YEAR LATER THE SAME ISSUE BEGAN OCCURRING MULTIPLES TIMES PER DAY UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO GET IT TO A DEALERSHIP.  THEY REPLACED THE THROTTLE BODY, THE ISSUE OCCURRED AGAIN.  THEY REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION, THE ISSUE OCCURRED AGAIN. IT IS NOW AT THE FORD DEALERSHIP GETTING DIAGNOSED YET AGAIN.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND MUST BE RESOLVED.  *TR",
