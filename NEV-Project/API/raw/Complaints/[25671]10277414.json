I JUST PUT A FULL TANK IN 2 DAYS AGO AND IT IS STILL READING PAST FULL. ON OCCASION IT WILL GO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO EMPTY, AND THEN BACK UP TO FULL AND THEN BACK DOWN AGAIN. THIS IS ALL WHEN EITHER RUNNING OR DRIVING WHEN THIS ALL HAPPENS. THIS IS VERY IRRITATING TO ME, CONSIDERING THIS IS OUR ONLY VEHICLE RIGHT NOW. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS PROBLEM IS VERY POPULAR IN THE 05-06, BUT NOW I AM HAVING PROBLEMS IN MY 07 AND I HAVE 47,000 MILES ON MINE. I THINK CHEVY SHOULD RECALL THIS. IT'S RIDICULOUS! *TR",
