THE CAR IS A TOTAL LOSS, AS WELL AS THE JACKET MY HUSBAND WAS (FORTUNATELY) WEARING WHEN THE FLAMES CAME SHOOTING OUT FROM THE ENGINE AREA INTO THE DRIVER'S SEAT.  A FRIEND OF MINE SUGGESTED THAT I CHECK IF OTHERS  HAD THIS PROBLEM, AND I CAME ACROSS THIS SITE.  IT LOOKS LIKE OTHERS HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM, IF THE NHTSA CAMPAIGN 97V019000  IS AN INDICATION OF SUCH.  AS FAR AS I KNOW, WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED THAT SOME FORD TEMPOS WERE POTENTIAL FIRE TRAPS. MY HUSBAND COULD HAVE BEEN SEVERELY BURNED, BUT FORTUNATELY, HIS JACKET TOOK THE BRUNT OF THE FLAMES.   *JB",
