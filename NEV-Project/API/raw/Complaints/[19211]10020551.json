OUR GAS GAUGE WOULD FROM FULL TO EMPTY.  ALL GAUGES ON THE DASH WOULD GO CRAZY. OUR BATTERY LIGHT HAD COME ON A FEW MILES BEFORE THIS OCCURRED.  WE LOST ALL POWER AND OUR TRUCK DECELERATED QUICKLY ON THE INTERSTATE.  WE FOUND A PARTS STORE AND PUT ON A NEW ALTERNATOR AND BATTERY THINKING THAT WOULD DO THE JOB.  AS WE CONTINUED OUR TRIP, THE GAUGES BEGAN TO DO THE SAME THING WITHIN TEN MILES OF CHANGING ALTERNATOR AND BATTERY.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE IS A FLAW IN 1999 FORD F150'S.  WE CHECKED ALL FUSES AND HAVE NO IDEA WHY THIS OCCURRED. THE TRUCK CANNOT BE DRIVEN BECAUSE IT WILL SHUT OFF WHILE DRIVING.       *TT",
