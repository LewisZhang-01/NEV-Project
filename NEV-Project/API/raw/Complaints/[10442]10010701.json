THE PASSENGER AIR BAG CAME OUT AT AN ANGLE SO AS TO HIT MY HUSBAND,(WHO WAS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT) IN THE GROIN AREA. THE AIR BAG RUPTURED HIS RIGHT TESTICLE AND HE HAD TO HAVE SURGERY. THIS HAS CAUSED US TO OWE SOME EXTENSIVE MEDICAL BILLS AT THIS POINT. WE HAD INSURANCE, BUT IT WILL NOT PAY ALL OF THE BILLS. I FEEL THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MEDICAL BILLS FOR THIS TYPE OF ACCIDENT,SINCE IT WAS CAUSED BY THE AIR BAG NOT DEPLOYING AS IT SHOULD HAVE.   *JB",
