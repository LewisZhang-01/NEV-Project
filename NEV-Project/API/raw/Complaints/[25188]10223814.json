WHILE THIS PROBLEM IS SPORADIC, IT HAS OCCURRED MANY TIMES SINCE WE BOUGHT THE CAR. IT NOW HAPPENS WHEN THE ENGINE IS WARM AND THE CAR IS BEING DRIVEN ON THE HIGHWAY, CAUSING A DANGEROUS SITUATION. THE DEALER AT FIRST TOLD US MANY TIMES TO IGNORE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT WOULD GO AWAY WHEN THE CAR WARMED UP; THEY FAILED TO FIND THE DEFECT AT FIRST. NOW, AFTER FINDING THE CYLINDER MISFIRE PROBLEM THEY NOW CLAIM THE DEFECT ISN'T COVERED BY WARRANTY. THE INCIDENT DATE BELOW IS THE MOST RECENT ONE; THE PROBLEM BEGAN EARLY IN 2005 SOON AFTER THE CAR WAS BOUGHT.  *TR",
