        "summary": "THE CAM BEARINGS OF MY 2000 FXDWG [DYNA WIDE GLIDE]  DESTROYED THEMSELVES IN KANSAS CITY AND THE BIKE WAS REPAIRED AT HARLEY DAVIDSONS EXPENSE  DUE TO POOR ENGINE DESIGN AND A LETTER THAT WAS SENT TO ME TELLING ME OF THE PROBLEM. IT IS NOW BROKEN AGAIN WITH AN $1,800 BILL. THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED A FATAL CRASH AND I FEEL THEY SHOULD PUT  A NEW ENGINE IN MY BIKE AND ALL OF THE OTHERS OUT THERE THAT HAVE NEEDED THE CAM BEARINGS REPAIRED. LITTLE DO THEY KNOW WHAT IS COMING THEIR WAY WITH THEIR ENGINES.  FIXING THE CAM BEARINGS IS ONLY PART OF THE PROBLEM. THE BRAKEING OF THE CAM BEARINGS CAUSE ALL OF THE METAL SHAVINGS TO DAMAGE THE ENGINE. HARLEY SAYS THAT SINCE THE BIKE HAS 9,000 MI. ON IT SINCE THE REBUILD THAT IT IS NOT THEIR FAULT. DOES THAT MEAN ALL HARLEYS ARE DESIGNED TO ONLY LAST 30,000 MI.? THEY ARE JUST ANOTHER ENRON, SCREWING THEIR CUSTOMERS FOR THEIR POOR MANUFACTURING AND PROFIT. NOT FIXING THEIR MISTAKES ONLY MAKES THEIR CUSTOMERS FOOT THE BILL AND NOT THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY. PLEASE  PUT OUT A RECALL ON ALL OF THE LATE 1999 AND EARLY 2000 MODELS OF HARLEY'S THAT WERE EFFECTED  BY CAM BEARING FAILURE. THERE IS NOT A REASON IN THE WORLD FOR NOT HAVING A RECALL WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE COST OF THEIR BIKES.",
