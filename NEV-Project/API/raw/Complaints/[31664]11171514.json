MY TRUCK SEEMS TO DO IT PRIMARY ON BRIDGES, EVEN ONES THAT BARELY HAVE A TRANSITION AND SEEM SMOOTH.  FORD RECENTLY UPDATED SOME PARTS AT LESS THAN 30K MILES.  TODAY, I WENT OVER THREE BRIDGES IN A ROW AT 70 MPH AND EACH BRIDGE MADE THE FRONT END SHAKE VIOLENTLY.  THE THIRD BRIDGE WAS IN A CONSTRUCTION ZONE AND A TRACTOR TRAILER NEARLY HIT ME.  YOU MUST SLOW TO 30 MPH TO MAKE IT STOP.  THIS IS AN EXTREME SAFETY HAZARD, YOU CAN'T ALWAYS SLOW TO 30 MPH IN 70 MPH TRAFFIC.  THIS IS A WIDELY KNOWN PROBLEM AND THE NHTSA NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.",
