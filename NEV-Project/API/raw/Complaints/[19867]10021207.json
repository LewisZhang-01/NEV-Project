I BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE ADHESIVE OR THE PROCESS THAT WAS USED TO BOND THE FIBER GLASS SIDES OF MY MOTOR HOME. I WAS TOLD BY THE WINNEBAGO FACTORY REP. THAT IT WAS MY FAULT THAT DELAMINATION WAS TAKING PLACE BECAUSE I DID NOT TAKE THE MOTOR HOME IN EVERY 6 MOS. TO THEIR FACILITY TO HAVE GASKETS AND SEALS INSPECTED OR RESEALED. I MAINTAIN THAT I HAVE DONE THE INSPECTIONS MYSELF AND ALL GASKETS AND SEALS ARE IN EXCELLENT SHAPE.  I SEE NO WATER  DAMAGE.   *JB",
