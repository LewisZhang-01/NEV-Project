        "summary": "DEAR SIR:  TO WHO IT MAY CONCERN.  I HAVE A 1998 PLYMOUTH CARAVAN VAN (THEY CALL IT A TRUCK) WITH A 3.3 LITER ENGINE.  WITH ABOUT 54,000 MILES ON IT .  LAST WEEK I MADE A SHORT TRIP TO LOWES ABOUT 3 MILES FROM HOME. WHEN I RETURNED HOME I PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY AND WENT INTO MY GARAGE. AFTER ABOUT 2 MIN I SAW FIRE DRIPPING FROM MY ENGINE, I GOT MY FIRE EXT. AND USED IT UNDER THE CAR. THEN I OPENED THE HOOD AND PUT OUT THE REST OF THE FIRE.  I THEN DISCONNECTED BOTH BATTERY TERMINALS AND CALLED THE WRECKER TO TOW MY CAR TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR (AUTOWEST DODGE IN ROSEVILLE AUTO MALL--- ROSEVILLE CA) .  I FOLLOWED THE WRECKER TO AUTOWEST AND TOLD THE DEALER TO REPAIR MY CAR.  THEY CALLED &  THE NEXT DAY I PICKED UP MY CAR .  THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A SHORT IN MY STARTER AND THEY HAD PUT IN A NEW STARTER AND REPAIRED THE BURNED UP WIRING HARNESS. MY CAR SEEMS TO BE WORKING OK NOW.  MY EXTENDED WARRANTY COVERED ALL BUT $50.00 .   I AM WRITING THIS REPORT BECAUSE WHAT IF---I HAD DRIVEN INTO THE GARAGE CLOSED THE DOOR AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE ? IT WOULD HAVE BURNED DOWN THE HOUSE OR WORSE.  I ASKED THE DEALER IF THEY HAD ANY OTHER CASES OF THIS AND HE SAID NO. I DO NOT TRUST AUTO DEALERS TO TELL THE TRUTH. SO I WILL LET YOU GUYS TAKE IT FROM HERE. *JB",
