I CANT HANDLE THE THOUGHT OF KEEPING A TRUCK THAT COST SO MUCH IN REPAIRS. AND NOW THE DEALER TELLS ME I NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION. THIS IS ONE WEEK AFTER I SPENT OVER 500 REPLACING THE SPARK PLUGS, FUEL FILTER, AND GETTING THE FUEL INJECTORS CLEANED. I HAVE ONLY 58,000 MILES ON THE THING AND WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT THE PLUGS DON'T NEED TO BE TOUCHED FOR 100,000 MILES. WELL IT WAS MISSING AND THAT WAS THE PROBLEM. THE TRUCK SLAMS INTO GEAR BETWEEN 1 AND 2, AND NOW THE PROBLEM IS MY TRANSMISSION IS BAD. AT 58,000 MILES? AND I'VE NEVER EVEN TOWED ANYTHING. JUST REGULAR WEAR AND TEAR? I THINK THESE TRUCKS MUST BE LEMONS. AFTER I GET THE TRANSMISSION FIXED, I'LL HAVE SPENT $5,600 IN A TWO YEAR SPAN. I HAVE TO SELL IT BECAUSE THE REPAIRS ARE MORE THAN THE PAYMENT. I GUESS THAT'S WHY IT WAS SOLD TO ME WHEN IT WAS ONLY TWO YEARS. OLD.    *NLM",
