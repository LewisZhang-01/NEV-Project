ONE OF HIS SELLING POINTS WAS A NEW HEAD GASKET HAD BEEN INSTALLED. WELL IT'S BEEN JUST OVER THE 3 MONTH, 3000 MILES AND THE HEAD GASKET BLEW, SPILLING OIL ALL OVER THE HIGHWAY. I WENT TO THE WEB, AND TO MY HORROR THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ALOT OF PEOPLE. THE ROADS ARE BEING MADE HAZARDOUS WITH SLIPPERY OIL AND PEOPLE ARE GETTING RIPPED OFF BY A BADLY DESIGNED ENGINE. CHRYSLER SHOULD RECALL THEM.  I KNOW YOU ARE WELL AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND HOPE YOUR AGENCY CAN MAKE CHRYSLER RECALL THIS ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.  *JB",
