CONCERNS FOR SAFETY AND BEING STRANDED CONTINUE.  I WILL MAKE NOTE THAT I AM A 68 YEAR OLD SENIOR CITIZEN WITH MULTIPLE DISABILITIES.  I CONTACTED THE DEALER, PARKWAY FORD OF WINSTON SALEM, NC AND SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT TO DETERMINE THE PROBLEM.  AFTER THEY RAN A DIAGNOSTIC PROGRAM, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CLUTCH NEEDED TO BE REPLACED A THIRD TIME.  THEY NEVER DID ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF THE TRANSMISSION SLIPPING OUT OF GEAR.  THEY SAID THIS WAS NORMAL AND THE WAY THE CAR WAS DESIGNED.  I NOTED THAT COASTING IS NOT SAFE, IT IS ALSO ILLEGAL.  THE CLUTCH WAS REPLACED AND ADJUSTMENTS  MADE.  AT THIS TIME I WAS REPRESENTED BY STERN LAW OF NOVI, MICHIGAN IN A MASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST FORD MOTOR COMPANY REGARDING THIS VEHICLE. WE NOTE THAT THIS CLUTCH REPLACEMENT WAS FIVE MONTHS SINCE THE LAST REPLACEMENT",
