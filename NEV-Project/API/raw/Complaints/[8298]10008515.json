LATE LAST YEAR, I HAD TO HAVE THE KEY LOCK CYLINDER AND SECURITY CHIP IN THE IGNITION/KEY SYSTEM REPLACED TO THE TUNE OF SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS (PROBLEM WITH FIDELITY WARRANTY SERVICE) AND NOW THE KEY CYLINDER WHICH WAS REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN REPLACED WAS APPARENTLY NOT REPLACED. NOW I CAN'T START MY CAR WITH THE KEY. THE KEY WILL NOT TURN, LIKE PUTTING YOUR CAR KEY IN ANOTHER CAR. IT WOULDN'T TURN THE LOCK.  I HAVE NOTICED SEVERAL TIMES WHEN I COULDN'T TURN THE CAR OFF ALL THE WAY BUT THE KEY WOULD COME OUT. I HAVE ALSO FOUND THE SAME PROBLEM IN OTHER GM CARS THAT I USE PROFESSIONALLY. THE CAR KEY COMES OUT FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN THE CAR IS RUNNING, OR WHEN THE CAR ISN'T TURNED ALL THE WAY OFF.... IT'S NOT A CONSTANT PROBLEM BUT IT IS A PROBLEM.  *JB",
