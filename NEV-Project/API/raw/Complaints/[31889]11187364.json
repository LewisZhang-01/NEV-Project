AFTER A YEAR OR SO THE SRS LIGHT CAME ON INTERMITTENTLY BUT WAS MOSTLY OFF. STARTING THIS WEEK (3/15/2019) THE SRS LIGHT HAS STAYED ON AND WON'T GO OFF. BASED ON WHAT I HAVE READ, THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR AZERA OWNERS. I BELIEVE A SECOND RECALL IS NECESSARY SINCE THE FIRST ONE DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM FOR VERY LONG.",
