        "summary": "WE ARE IN A DISUPUTE WITH DIALMERCHRYSLER REGARDING A ENGINE REPAIR WITH OUR 1999 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE LAREDO.  ON DEC. 23, 2002 WE BROKE DOWN ON THE HIGHWAY BECAUSE A ROCKER ARM SPRING BROKE CAUSING A ROD TO BREAK THROUGH THE VALVE COVER AND DROP DOWN INTO THE ENGINE CAUSING $1600 IN DAMAGE.  THE JEEP HAS 43,000 MILES ON IT AND IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY.  WE PURCHASED THE JEEP IN FEB. 2002 AND SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE REPLACED THE ROTORS, A LEAKING SEALS AND NOW THE ENGINE PROBLEM.  WHEN WE APPROACHED CHRYSLER ABOUT POSSIBLE ASSISTANCE WITH THE REPAIR BILL, WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE WAS NO PREVIOUS HISTORY OF ENGING PROBLEMS AND WE DID NOT PURCHASE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY SO THEY WOULD NOT HELP US.  OUR POINT IS THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DOUBTFUL THAT THE ENGINE WOULD HAVE HAD THIS KIND OF PROBLEM (NOR SHOULD IT HAVE THIS PROBLEM) WITH SUCH LOW MILES.  ALSO, WE WERE NEVER OFFERED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY AT TIME OF PURCHASE.  WHEN WE DISCUSSED THIS WITH THE SALESMAN HE STATED THAT COST WAS AN ISSUE WHEN BUYING THE JEEP SO HE DIDN'T WANT THE PRICE TO BE ANY HIGHER.  ISN'T COST ALWAYS THE ISSUE WHEN BUYING A NEW CAR AND SHOULDN'T WE HAVE BEEN OFFERED A CHANCE TO PURCHASE THE WARRANTY?  WE FEEL THAT A $6 SPRING SHOULDN'T CAUSE $1600 TO AN ENGINE ANYHOW.  IS THERE ANY WAY YOU COULD BE OF HELP TO US?",
