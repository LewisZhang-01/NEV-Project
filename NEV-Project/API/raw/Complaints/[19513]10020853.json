TOOK VEHICLE TO TOYOTA WHO REFUSED TO FIX IT UNDER WARRANTY, BECAUSE THEY SAID IT WAS CONSUMER'S FAULT THAT IT HAPPENED.  THEY SAID THAT FUEL GOT INTO THE CHARCOAL CANISTER, WHICH THEY CLAIMED TO BE EVIDENCE THAT CONSUMER TOPPED OFF AT THE GAS PUMP.  I TOLD THEM THAT I NEVER TOPPED OFF (FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS AS WELL AS VEHICLE PROTECTION), AND THEY SAID IT ALSO COULD HAVE BEEN BECAUSE THE CAR SAT AT AN ANGLE IN THE DRIVE WAY BUT THAT THEY STILL WOULDN'T FIX IT.     *TT",
