UPON INVESTIGATION ON THE INTERNET, I FOUND THAT THIS IS A COMMON AILMENT FOR FORD FOCUSES, AND IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION AT NHTSA AS A FAULTY PART. I WISH TO ADD MY COMPLAINT TO THE DATA ACCUMULATING ON THIS SUBJECT, IN HOPES THAT FORD DOES A RECALL FOR THIS MECHANICAL FLAW.  MY DEALERSHIP SIMPLY TOLD ME THAT THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THE 'FUEL PUMP WENT BAD' AND NEEDED REPLACING.   *NLM",
