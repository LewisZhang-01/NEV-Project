ONCE THERE, THE DEALER STATES THERE IS NO CODE STORED IN THE COMPUTER AND THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.  ONCE THE CAR IS RESTARTED, THE LIGHT IS OFF, BUT COMES ON AGAIN A FEW DAYS LATER.  THIS HAS HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES.  I AM WORRIED OF AN AIR BAG FAILURE DUE TO THIS INDICATOR LIGHT, BUT THE DEALER CAN'T HELP BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF STORED CODES.   *NLM",
