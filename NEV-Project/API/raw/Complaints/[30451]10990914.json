        "summary": "WHEN CLOSING REAR POWER LIFT GATE, A STROLLER FELL PARTLY OUT OF THE TRUNK. I INSTINCTIVELY GRABBED IT, AND THE GATE HIT THE BACK OF MY HEAD AND STARTED TO SLAM ME INTO THE CAR BEFORE I COULD PULL MY HEAD OUT. THE DOOR DID NOT STOP CLOSING. ACCORDING TO THE SUBARU INSTRUCTION MANUAL, THE REAR GATE CAN CAUSE SERIOUS PERSONAL INJURY BY ENTRAPMENT. THE DOOR DID NOT STOP WHEN ENCOUNTERING RESISTANCE (MY HEAD). THE DEALER SAYS THAT I CANNOT CHANGE THIS TO A MANUAL CONTROL REAR HATCH WITHOUT DESTROYING THE STRUTS THAT HOLD THE DOOR UP. I CAN CLOSE IT MANUALLY AS LONG AS I REMEMBER TO TAKE THE HEIGHT CONTROL OFF WITH A BUTTON ON THE FRONT DASH EVERY TIME I USE THE CAR OUTSIDE THE GARAGE. WHEN HEIGHT CONTROL IS ON, WHICH IS THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE REAR DOOR BEFORE IT OPENS FULLY AND THEREFORE MUST BE USED IN OUR GARAGE, YOU CANNOT CLOSE IT MANUALLY. SINCE IT CLOSES SLOWLY (8 SECONDS -- LONG FOR CLOSING A DOOR), YOU HAVE TO BE VERY AWARE OF CHILDREN'S MOVEMENTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN RAPID, AND SUPPRESS YOUR OWN REACTIONS IF SOMETHING STARTS TO FALL OUT. THE DOOR SHOULD STOP READILY IF IT ENCOUNTERS AN OBJECT EVEN AS SMALL AS A FINGER OR ELSE IT SHOULD BE MANUAL AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO STOP IT AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS WHEN OPENING IT MANUALLY.",
