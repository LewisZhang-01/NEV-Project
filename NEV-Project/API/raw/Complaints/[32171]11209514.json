        "summary": "FIRST SIGN OF AN ISSUE WAS THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ILLUMINATING IN OCTOBER OF 2018. SHORTLY AFTER THE ENGINE RANDOMLY STARTED LOSING POWER AND SHUTTING DOWN COMPLETELY AT RANDOM INTERVALS. IT COULD EITHER BE WHILE DRIVING OR SITTING AT A STOP LIGHT. I GO TO ACCELERATE AND NOTICE THE ENGINE HAS SHUT OFF.     THE CAR WILL FREQUENTLY BEHAVE AS IF IT HAS REDUCED POWER WHEN PUSHING THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL. THE RPMS OF THE CAR WILL ALSO RANDOMLY FLUCTUATE AS THE CAR IS STRUGGLING TO GET ENOUGH FUEL TO KEEP IT RUNNING WHICH ALSO BRINGS A VERY ROUGH IDLE. THE RPMS DO NOT CLIMB AS QUICKLY AND THE ENGINE HAS A LOW RUMBLE TO IT SOUNDING LIKE IT IS STRUGGLING. THIS IS ALSO ACCOMPANIED BY WHAT SOUNDS LIKE BACKFIRES COMING FROM THE EXHAUST.    WHEN REFUELING AND PUTTING THE GAS PUMP INTO THE CAR THERE IS A LARGE HIGH PRESSURE RELEASE FROM THE GAS TANK. UPON TRYING TO RESTART THE CAR THE STARTER MOTOR HAS TO SPIN FOR AN EXTRA 5 SECONDS OR SO UNTIL THE ENGINE TURNS ON. WHEN IT DOES TURN ON IT SPUTTERS AND STRUGGLES TO GET TO A STABLE IDLE RPM.",
