        "summary": "TPMS. TIRE PRESSURE SENSORS ARE REQUIRED ON ALL NEW VEHICLES NOW TO \"HELP AID IN SAFETY?\" PROBLEM IS LIKE ON MY 2005 CHRYSLER TOWN & COUNTRY, THE SENSORS ARE MADE WITH A WATCH BATTERY AS THE SENSOR POWER SOURCE. THIS IS FINE IF THE CONSUMER CAN REPLACE THESE WATCH BATTERIES OR HAVE THE WATCH BATTERIES REPLACED WHEN THEY ARE DEAD, BUT, \"BUT\" CHRYSLER HAS MADE THE SENSORS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE SENSOR IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED BY TRYING TO CHANGE THE BATTERIES. ONE MUST REPLACE THE ENTIRE SENSOR WHEN THE WATCH BATTERIES ARE DEAD. THE COST FOR REPLACING (4) SENSORS EVERY (3) TO(4) YEARS IS EXTREMELY OVERPRICED. SO TO CONCLUDE MY COMPLAINT, THE INTENT OF SAFETY IS NOT WHAT IS GOING ON HERE WITH THE CAR MANUFACTURERS, BUT A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR PROFIT. SEE, WHAT THIS HAS NOW CAUSED IS THAT SINCE THE COST IS SO HIGH TO REPLACE THE SENSORS WHEN THE CONSUMER SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHANGE A SMALL BATTERY FOR POCKET CHANGE, THE CONSUMER WILL JUST LET THE WARNING LIGHT SHINE AND NOT REPLACE THE EXPENSIVE SENSORS WHEN A WATCH BATTERY IS DEAD. THAT'S WHAT I AM DOING. I CAN'T BE ALONE. SAFETY? ONLY FOR THE 1ST 3 YEARS OR SO....AFTER THAT? SAME AS IT USE TO BE WITH NO SENSORS. *TR",
