NOW THE VEHICLE SPEWS OUT BLUE SMOKE WHEN STARTING UP OR ACCELERATING.  THE OIL IS ALSO SLUDGEY.  WE TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AFTER HEARING THAT THE BLUE SMOKE PROBLEM IS A RECALL ISSUE, BUT THE DEALER WANTS PROOF OF ALL OIL CHANGES, EVEN THOUGH I CHANGE THE OIL AND FILTER MYSELF.  A FRIEND AROUND THE CORNER HAS THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH THE FAULTY DOORS.    *NLM",
