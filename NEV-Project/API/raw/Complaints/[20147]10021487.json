I HEARD A \"POP\", PULLED FORWARD ABOUT 10 TO 15 FEET WHEN I STARTED TO SMELL SOMETHING BURNING. I LOOKED DOWN AT THE GAUGES AND EVERYTHING LOOKED OFF. WHEN I LOOKED BACK UP I SAW BLACK SMOKE COMING OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD. I PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND TURNED OFF THE ENGINE. I THEN TURNED TO MY DAUGHTER AND TOLD HER TO GET OUT OF THE CAR AND GET AWAY FROM IT. BY THAT TIME FLAMES WERE COMING OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD. WE BOTH GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND CALLED 911. BY THE TIME THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED THE FIRE HAD GOTTEN IN SIDE THE CAR AND CRACKED ALL THE WINDOWS. THE FIREMAN SMASHED THE DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW TO GET TO THE HOOD RELEASE BUT THE CABLE HAD ALREADY BEEN BURNED AND THE RELEASE DID NOT WORK. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD TO PRY THE HOOD OF THE CAR OFF.
