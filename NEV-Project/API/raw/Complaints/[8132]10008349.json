I WAS ABLE TO KEEP THE CAR UNDER CONTROL AND MOVE IT OFF ROAD TO A SAFE SPOT.  I HAD RESEARCHED TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS WITH MY CAR SO I REALIZED THE SYMPTOMS IMMEDIATELY BUT HAD LESS THAN A DAY'S NOTICE BEFORE IT HAPPENED.  OTHERS HAVE REPORTED EVEN LESS NOTICE WITH THEIR CARS ON THE HIGHWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED DROPPING FROM 5TH TO 2ND GEAR JERKING THEM FORWARD AND CAUSING THE CAR TO SWERVE.*JB",
