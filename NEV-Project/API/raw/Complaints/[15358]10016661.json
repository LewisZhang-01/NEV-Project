THE GAS PEDAL OFTEN GETS HUNG UP WHICH LEAVES ME TAPPING IT MY FOOT TO GET IT TO GO, SO THAT I DO NOT HAVE AN ACCIDENT. THE WHOLE CAR RIDES VERY ROUGHLY. IT ALSO HANGS UP IN PASSING GEAR ALMOST EVERY TIME. AND ALSO HOW DO I FIND OUT WHERE TO CHECK TO SEE IF ALL THE RECALLS WERE TAKEN CARE OF. BE CAREFUL FOR WHAT U BUY.   *NLM",
