I, TOO, DO NOT DRIVE THE CAR FOR LONG DISTANCES FOR FEAR OF GETTING STRANDED HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM HOME.    I, TOO, HAVE GOTTEN NO SUPPORT FROM VW.    I, TOO, ONLY GET THE BAD COILS REPLACED BY THE DEALER.  THEY ARE UNWILLING TO REPLACE ONES THAT HAVEN'T DIED YET.    I, TOO, AM EMBARRASSED TO SAY THAT I HAVE A CAR THAT HAS 11,000 MILES ON IT AND CAN'T BE DRIVEN FOR FEAR OF BEING STRANDED.    TO OTHER FELLOW PASSAT OWNERS WITH THIS PROBLEM, PLEASE DON'T THINK THAT IT ONLY HAPPENS IN COLD WEATHER.  MY FIRST ONE DIED IN AUGUST (THE SECOND ONE DIED IN OCTOBER).      IS NHTSA PLANNING TO INTERCEDE?",
