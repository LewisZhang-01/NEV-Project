DEALERSHIP SUPPOSEDLY REPLACED ABS MODULE ONCE FOR FREE THEN CHARGED ME TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS TO REPLACE IT AGAIN. REPLACED PADS, SHOES, CALIPERS ETC. BRAKES STILL DO THIS, HAVE CAME CLOSE TO HITTING THINGS IN FRONT OF ME DUE TO THIS. FROM READING OTHER ARTICLES ON THE NET I AM TOLD BY UNHOOKING THE ABS IT WILL STOP DOING THIS BUT THEN I WILL HAVE NO ABS. WHATS THE POINT IN HAVING A NEW TRUCK WHEN THE REAR END WILL LOCK UP JUST LIKE IT DOES IN MY 1982 FORD TRUCK WITH NO ABS.",
