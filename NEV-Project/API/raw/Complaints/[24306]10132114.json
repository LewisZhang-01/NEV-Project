SECOND,@ 65K I HAD TO REPLACE THE FRONT LEFT WHEEL HUB ASSEMBLY AS TALKED ABOUT IN ONE OF THE OTHER COMPLAINTS I READ. THIRD, @ 95K MY TRANSFER CASE DEVELOPED A LEAK AND I LOST ALL THE FLUID. A CHEVROLET MECHANIC SHOWED ME A TRANSFER CASE THAT HAD GONE BAD DUE TO THE SAME PROBLEM AND HAD BEEN USED IN 4WD W/OUT FLUID IN IT. ANOTHER CHEVROLET MECHANIC TOLD ME HE HAD SEEN SEVERAL OF THESE AND THAT \"JB WELD IS YOUR FRIEND\". SO I PATCHED THE HOLE, AND 10K LATER IT DEVELOPED A SECOND LEAK IN A SIMILAR LOCATION AND ALSO ABOUT THIS SAME TIME AN ELECTRICAL PART (ABOUT $550) WENT OUT FOR MY 4WD. NOW AT 130K IT HAS DEVELOPED A THIRD LEAK! ALSO STARTING @ APPROXIMATELY 50K, MY REAR DIFFERENTIAL HAS LOCKED UP ON ME SEVERAL TIMES AND I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE 4 CABLES ON MY TAILGATE. AFTER BEING A CHEVY MAN ALL MY LIFE I THINK I WILL LOOK AT TOYOTA.  *NM",
