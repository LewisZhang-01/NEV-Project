NOTICED THAT MANY OTHER OWNERS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH IN 96'S.  MY CAR HAS 70,000 MILES ON IT, AND FROM WHAT I'VE LEARNED, A HEAD GASKET SHOULD LAST ABOUT 10 YEARS OF 100,000 MILES.  I WOULD LIKE CHEVY TO GET INVOLVED AND PAY FOR THIS, SINCE IT OBVIOUSLY SEEMS TO BE SUCH A PROBLEM WITH CAVALIERS.",
