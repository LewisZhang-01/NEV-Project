I HAVE TAKEN IT TO MY CHEVROLET DEALER FOUR TIMES AND THE PROBLEM IS NOT RESOLVED.  THE DEALER REPLACED ALL FOUR TIRES, MATCH BALANCED THE TIRES THREE TIMES, AND TURNED THE BRAKE ROTORS.  THE SERVICE MANAGER INFORMED ME THAT THE VIBRATION IS DUE TO THE NEW SUSPENSION DESIGN.  I FOUND A GM BULLETIN, #PI1354C, THAT OUTLINES A SPECIFIC PROCEDURE TO DIAGNOSE THE ISSUE.  HOWEVER, THE DEALER DID NOT FOLLOW IT.",
