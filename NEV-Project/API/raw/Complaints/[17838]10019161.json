I NOW HAVE 74,000 MILES ON IT AND HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THE POWER STEERING PUMP AND COMPLETE POWER STEERING RACK NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AT THE COST OF $1200.00.  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY I SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.  I HAVE REVIEWED THE NTSB WEBSITE AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME PROBLEM.  WHY IS THERE NOT A RECALL?  I TRIED TO GET THE DEALERSHIP TO COVER SOME OF THE COSTS AND ALL THEY OFFERED WAS A FREE RENTAL.  MAYBE I SHOULD WRITE OPRAH, SEEMS EVERYONE LISTENS TO HER AND SEE IF SHE CAN MAKE IT PUBLIC!",
