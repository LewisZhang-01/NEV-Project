LAST 11-03-02 MY HUSBAND ENRIQUE LIM PURCHASED A BRAND NEW CIVIC HONDA SI . GRACE HONDA HAD PRE-INSTALLED AFTER MARKET  WHEELS AND TIRES. THIS MODIFICATION WAS NOT APPROVED BY THE MANUFACTURER HONDA. 02-06-03 I BROUGHT BACK MY BRAND NEW VEHICLE TO GRACE HONDA COMPLAINING THAT MY TWO FRONT TIRES HAVE SEVERAL BUBBLES ON THE WALL OF THE TIRE. I INFORMED GRACE HONDA THAT THESE AFTER MARKET TIRES AND WHEELS MIS-MATCH ODD SIZED RIM AND TIRES WILL CAUSE POTENTIAL TIRE EXPLOSIONS, SERIOUS INJURIES OR DEATH. 02-07-03 SALES MGR. ROMAN TIOSECO AND BOBBY QUEMA REFUSED TO REPLACE THESE FAULTY POOR QUALITY PRODUCTS. THEY STATED THAT THESE WHEELS AND TIRES WERE NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY . GRACE HONDA SAID THAT THESE WHEELS AND TIRES WERE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGED CAUSED BY ROAD HAZARDS, POT HOLES AND UNEVEN STREET PAVEMENT. I REQUESTED GRACE HONDA TO REPLACE THESE AFTER MARKET WHEELS AND TIRES AND INSTALL THE ORIGINAL HONDA EQUIPMENT BUT THEY REFUSED TO RESOLVE THESE SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUES. GRACE HONDA MODIFIED THE VEHICLE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT TO MISLEAD CONSUMER THAT THEY REPLACED THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT AND CONVINCED ME THAT THEY INSTALLED A BETTER QUALITY TIRES WHICH I PAYED ADDITIONAL $ 1,595.00. GRACE HONDA DID NOT DISCLOSE THAT THESE WHEELS AND TIRES WERE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE CAUSED BY ROAD HAZARDS, POT HOLES AND UNEVEN PAVEMENT.GRACE HONDA WERE ENGAGED IN VERY UNFAIR BUSINESS PRATICES, GROSS RECKLESS NEGLIGENCE AND HAVING NO REGARDS FOR SAFETY. MY VEHICLE IS ONLY THREE MONTHS OLD BUT THE VEHICLE HAS BECOME A ULTIMATE LEMON  BECAUSE THEY MODIFIED THE WHEELS AND TIRES AND INSTALLED POOR QUALITY PRODUTS. THESE WHEELS AND TIRES WILL EXPLODE ANYTIME AND WILL CAUSE SERIOUS INJURIES AND DEATHS. GRACE HONDA INFORMED ME LAST 02-28-03 THAT THEY WILL NOT REPLACE THE WHEELS AND TIRES. *JB",
