UPON INSPECTION I FOUND THAT THE PUMP HAD ALREADY BEEN REPLACED ONCE BY THE PREVIOUS OWNER WHO PURCHASED THE TRUCK NEW.  I THEN BEGAN RESEARCH ON THE PART AND FOUND NUMEROUS OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR TRUCKS AND HAD TO PAY FOR REPAIRS IN EXCESS OF $750.00.  I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT GM CHANGED THE DESIGN OF THE CONTROL MODULE DUE TO AN EXTREMELY HIGH FAILURE RATE, HOWEVER, THEY LEAVE IT UP THE CONSUMER TO PURCHASE THE UPDATED PART ONCE THE ORIGINAL STOPS WORKING.  *JB",
