        "summary": "THE TROTTLE STUCK ON MY 1996 CHRYSLER SEABRING.  I WAS PASSING A VEHICLE AND WHEN II WENT TO BRAKE AND GET IN FRONT OF HIM I COULDN'T STOP.  THE ENGINE WAS REVING AT 8000 RPMS.  AND I WAS HOLDING THE BRAKES AS HARD AS I COULD AND I WAS GOING ABOUT MAYBE 60 MPH.  I DID GET THE CAR TO COME TO A STOP, AFTER HAVING TO TURN 2 CORNERS VERY FAST AND GOING THROUGH AN INTERSECTION.  I HAD PUT IT BACK AND FORTH FORM NURTAL & REVERSE AND WHEN THE CAR WAS SLOW ENOUGH I PUT IT IN PARK AND TURNED THE KEY OFF.  I CAME CLOSE TO USING A WALL, OR A HOUSE UNDER CONSTRUCTION FOR A WAY TO STOP.  I WAS EXTREAMY SCARRED AND LUCKY THAT NO ONE WAS HURT AND AT THE TIME, NO ONE HAD BEEN GOING THROUGH THE INTERSECTION.   TODAY WE CALLED CHRYSLER AND THEY WILL FIX THE PROBLEM, BUT WE NEED TO GET THE CAR THERE.    IT IS UNSAFE TO EVEN START THE  ENGINE RIGHT NOW.  WE LOOKED ON LINE AND FOUND NHTSA CAMPAIGN  # 02V186000.",
