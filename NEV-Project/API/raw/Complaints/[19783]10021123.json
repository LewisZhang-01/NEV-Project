        "summary": "THE FOG LAMP LENSES ON MY 1993 CHRYSLER TOWN & COUNTRY MINIVAN KEEP FALLING OFF. THERE IS AN ENGINEERING DESIGN DEFECT IN THAT THE LENS ARE GLUED IN AND NOT HELD IN BY SCREWS.  AT ABOUT THE 8-10 YEAR TIME PERIOD, THE GLUE DETERIORATES AND THE LENS FALL OFF WHILE DRIVING.  THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM IN ALL 1993 AND 1994 CHRYSLER TOWN AND COUNTRY MINIVANS.  THE LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP WANTS $106 PLUS LABOR TO REPLACE A SINGLE LENS. I HAVE CALLED AND WRITTEN TO CHRYSLER COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, BUT THEY INSIST THAT SINCE THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY, THEY CAN DO NOTHING TO HELP. I BELIEVE THIS TO BE A SAFETY ISSUE AND REQUEST YOUR ASSISTANCE IN GETTING CHRYSLER TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.*AK",
