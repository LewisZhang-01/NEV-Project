INCLUDING NO HORN, BOTH HEADLIGHTS WENT OUT WITH IN 4 DAYS OF EACH OTHER, THE ENGINE HAS ERRATIC SHIFT POINTS ESPECIALLY WHEN COLD.  THE PROBLEM IS VW SAYS NOT TO LET THE ENGINE WARM UP BUT MY ENGINE OIL HEATER IS BROKEN.  TAKES ABOUT 10 MINUTES AT FREEWAY SPEED TO WARM UP.  AND THE SUPPOSED ABS ARE NOT REALLY ABS BRAKES WHEN EMERGENCY BRAKING FROM 75 MPH. AND MANY LITTLE INTERIOR MECHANICAL ISSUES.*JB",
