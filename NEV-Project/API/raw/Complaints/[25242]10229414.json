APPARENTLY IT IS COMMON FOR THE ABC PRESSURE HOSES TO LEAK AT THE JOINTS, AS THE RUBBER THAT MAKES UP THE JOINT IS DISSOLVED BY THE HYDRAULIC FLUID. THIS PRESENTS NOT ONLY A DANGER BECAUSE OF POOR HANDLING, BUT THE HYDRAULIC FLUID DRIPS ON THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER CAUSING A FIRE HAZARD AND AIR POLLUTION. THE CAR HAD APPROXIMATELY 65,000 MILES. SOME S CLASS CARS HAVE BEEN RECALLED FOR THIS, BUT MY VIN NUMBER WAS NOT AMONG THE RECALLED VEHICLES. THE ENGINE HAD TO BE REMOVED TO REPLACE THIS HOSE AT A COST OF $2,900.  *TR",
