ON THE DATE IN QUESTION, I WENT TO PUT THE CAR INTO GEAR, AND THE GEAR SHIFT SHEARED OFF IN MY HAND.  WHEREAS NO ONE WAS INJURED IN THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT, I DO BELIEVE THAT HAD THE CAR BEEN IN MOTION IT COULD HAVE CAUSED SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH. ONE DOES NOT EXPECT IN A 2-1/2 YEAR OLD CAR FOR THE GEAR SHIFT TO COME OFF. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. TS",
