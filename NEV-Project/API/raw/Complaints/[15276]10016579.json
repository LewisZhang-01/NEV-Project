IT HAS LESS THAN 3500 MILES, AND THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSMISSION ALREADY, THE BRAKES MAKE A SLIGHT NOISE, AND THE BATTERY STARTED CORRODING, TOO.  WHEN I CALLED DAIMLER-CHRYSLER, THEY WOULD NOT GIVE ME SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT MY VEHICLE.  I AM QUESTIONING WHETHER MY VEHICLE IS REALLY NEW...  I PAID WAY TOO MUCH FOR IT TO BE ACTING THIS WAY - AGAIN UNDER 3500 MILES!    *NLM",
