FOR THIS LATEST TRANSMISSION WHEN DRIVING IN CONGESTED TRAFFIC AREAS WHERE THE TRANSMISSION DOES NOT ALWAYS GO TO THE NEXT GEAR, IT WILL \"LAG\" AND FALL BACK TO THE LOWER GEAR AS IF THE BRAKE WAS BEING APPLIED VERY HARD.  TOOK THE CAR TO THE SERVICE CENTER AND WAS TOLD BY THE MECHANIC THAT THE  \"TRANSMISSION IS SHIFTING THROUGH ALL OF ITS POINTS NORMALLY\". I INDICATED TO THEM THIS IS NOT THE REASON WHEN I CAME TO THEM.  THEY IGNORED MY REASONS FOR COMING TO THEM AND THEY THEN PROCEEDED TO CLAIM THAT ITS NORMAL FOR THE TRANSMISSION TO \"HANG\" AND FALL BACK DUE TO \"THE COMPUTER GETTING CONFUSED AS TO WHAT GEAR TO GO TO\".  AS A RESULT ITS NORMAL FOR THE TRANSMISSION TO \"LAG\" OR \"HANG\".  I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM WITH THE OTHER TWO TRANSMISSIONS I HAD....SO, THIS IS ANYTHING BUT NORMAL !!!  *JB",
