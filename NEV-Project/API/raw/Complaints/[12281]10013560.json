        "summary": "THE DEALER RECOMMENDED THE FRONT BRAKE ROTORS, PADS, AND CALIPERS ON MY 1999 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $400.  THIS IS DUE TO A SERVICE BULLETIN ISSUED BY CHRYSLER IN EARLY 2002.  ALTHOUGH CHRYSLER RECOMMENDS THIS KIT FOR 1999 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEES, IT WILL ONLY COVER THE COST OF THIS CHANGE FOR VEHICLES CURRENTLY UNDER WARRANTY.  THE DEALER TOLD ME THE ORIGINAL CALIPER DESIGN WAS A TWO PISTON ARRANGEMENT THAT APPLIED UNEVEN PRESSURE TO THE ROTOR THROUGH THE BRAKE PADS RESULTING IN UNEVEN WEAR ON THE ROTORS.  THE NEW CALIPER IS A FOUR PISTON DESIGN THAT APPLIES PRESSURE IN A MORE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED FASHION.  AN INADEQUATE DESIGN OF THE FRONT BRAKE CALIPER THAT RESULTS IN UNEVEN WEAR IS A SAFETY ISSUE THE COST OF WHICH SHOULD BE COVERED BY CHRYSLER FOR ALL VEHICLES CONTAINING THIS PROBLEM.  I WAS ADVISED BY CHRYLSER THAT IF A RECALL IS ISSUED IN THE FUTURE I WOULD BE REIMBURSED.   *NLM",
