THE DEALER SAID TO CHANGE GAS AND IT WOULD PROBABLY WEAR OFF, BUT IT HASN'T AND I HAVE BEEN READING ON THE INTERNET THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS, SO I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.  ALSO, WHEN I AM STOPPED, SOMETIMES THE COROLLA WILL SURGE FORWARD.  I READ WHERE SOMEONE ELSE IS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM ABOUT THIS, TOO.  I AM READY TO TRADE THIS CAR BECAUSE I DIDN'T BUY A BRAND NEW CAR TO SMELL THIS CONTINUALLY.  IT IS VERY DISTURBING AND MAY BE UNSAFE SMELLING THE EMISSIONS FROM THIS.   *JB",
