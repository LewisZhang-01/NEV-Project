I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WERE ALL OUT OF PARTS, BUT I WOULD BE PLACED ON A WAITLIST TO HAVE THE AIRBAG INFLATOR REPLACED. I RECEIVED THIS MAILING CLOSE TO A YEAR AGO, AND STILL, NO ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN TO REMEDY THE SITUATION. IF THIS RECALL WERE NOT SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS SAFETY, I WOULD NOT BE HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THE DELAY, BUT THIS HAS TO DO WITH PASSENGER SAFETY, AND I AM EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED THAT THERE STILL ARE NOT ENOUGH PARTS TO HAVE THIS RECALL FIXED.",
