I  HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED .  I GOT ON LINE TO RESEARCH ABOUT THIS LOCKING MECHANISM  AND HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH MILLIONS OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS TO THIS VERY ISSUE  THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH MILLIONS OF COMPLAINTS BEING FILED AGAINST NISSAN FOR THIS SITUATION.  APPARENTLY THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL ON THIS INTERNAL  STEERING WHEEL LOCK MECHANISM HOWEVER NISSAN HAS PASSED THE COST OF THE FAULTY COMPONENT ONTO THE UNEXPECTED CONSUMER. THIS COST ME $1000.00 . SHAME ON YOU NISSAN. THANK GOD I WAS NOT IN MOTION.  *TR",
