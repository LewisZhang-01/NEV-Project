I DISCOVERED THE VEHICLE RUNNING, DOORS LOCKED AND IGNITION IN THE OFF POSITION. TO TURN OFF THE ENGINEI INSERTED THE KEY, TURNED IT TO THE ON POSITION AND THEN OFF. THIS OCCURRED ONCE IN MY GARAGE, CAUSING CARBON MONOXIDE EXHAUST TO ENTER THE LIVING QUARTERS. IT HAPPENED A SECOND TIME WHILE PARKED AWAY FROM HOME, WITH THE KEYS REMOVED. THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY, BECAUSE IT WAS PLACED IN PARK WHEN THE ENGINE WAS TURNED OFF.",
