DEALER SAYS BRAKES ARE SMALL FOR THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE, THEY OVERHEAT EASILY AND THEY HAVE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM CUSTOMERS.  RETURNED VEHICLE 3 DAYS AFTER PURCHASING IT AND REQUEST ATTENTION.  AFTER SEVERAL TRIPS AND COMMUNICATIOS TO THE DEALER AND TOYOTA, I WAS TOLD THE BRAKES DON'T WORK WELL, BUT THAT IS HOW THEY WERE DESIGNED.  I WAS TOLD I WOULD HAVE TO LEARN TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE AS THE BRAKES ARE DIFFERENT THAN OTHER VEHICLES.  THE VEHICLE IS VERY DANGEROUS TO DRIVE ON THE FREEWAY AND IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ON DOWNHILLS.IT IS SO DANGEROUS THAT WE AVOID DRIVING THE VEHICLE UNLESS NECESSARY.  IF WE ARE TAKING THE FAMILY ON TRIP THROUGH HILLS OR THE MOUNTAINS WE RENT ANOTHER VEHICLE AS I VALUE THE LIFE OF MY FAMILY.*AK",
