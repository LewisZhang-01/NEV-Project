FOUND IT TO BE THE FUEL PULSATION DAMPENER, A COMMONLY FAILING COMPONENT IN THE FUEL SYSTEM, BEING A LITTLE PLASTIC CAP THAT HOLDS BACK THE FUEL FROM LEAKING DIRECTLY ON THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD. I KNOW OF NUMEROUS FIRES CAUSED BY THIS OFTEN RESULTING IN A FULL ENGINE VEHICLE BURN OUT. I HAVE REPLACED THE SYSTEM WITH STRAIGHT FUEL LINES WHICH, BAD FOR THE ENGINE IS THE PRICE I WILL PAY TO KEEP FROM HAVING A ENGINE FIRE. I ALSO NOW FEEL FORCED TO KEEP A FIRE EXTINGUISHER IN THE CAR IN EASY REACH AT ALL TIMES.  *JB",
