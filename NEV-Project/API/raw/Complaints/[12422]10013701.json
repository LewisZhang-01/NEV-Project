I TOOK THE CAR TO THE NEAREST DEALER, NISSANWORLD OF SPRINGFIELD, NJ.  WHILE THERE I MET OTHER 6 OTHER MAXIMA OWNERS WHO HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE IN OTHER PARTS OF NJ.  THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD US THAT 48 OTHER MAXIMAS IN HILLSIDE, NJ HAD THEIR HID HEADLIGHTS STOLEN.  NISSAN OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.  SOME OWNERS HAD THEIR HID HEADLIGHTS STOLEN MORE THAN ONCE.  THEY HAVE SINCE BEEN REPLACED BUT AT ADDITIONAL INSURANCE COST.   *NLM",
