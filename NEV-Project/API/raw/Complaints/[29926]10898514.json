        "summary": "MY CAR HAS TRANSMISSION ISSUES. IT SHUDDERS AND HESITATES WHEN TRYING TO GO INTO GEAR.IT HAS BEEN TO SERVICE WELL OVER 6 TIMES IN 2 YEARS. I AM TOLD THAT THIS IS THE DESIGN OF THE CAR AND I NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS 6-SPEED AUTOMATIC SHIFTS INTERNALLY DIFFERENT. WHEN ON THE OPEN ROAD AND IT IS IN GEAR IT FUNCTIONS OK. IN TOWN GOING FROM STOP LIGHT TO STOP LIGHT IS WHEN THE ISSUE OCCURS. IT HESITATES IN ACCELERATION AND SHUDDERS. IT HAS FAILED ME EXITING ONTO A MAJOR FREEWAY BY NOT KICKING INTO THE PROPER GEAR. I NO LONGER TRY TO MERGE ONTO A FREEWAY IN THIS CAR. THERE IS NOT A DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THIS CAR IS A SAFETY ISSUE. THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS JUST LIKE MINE ABOUT THIS CAR. I HAVE TRIED AND TRIED TO TELL FORD CORPORATION AND THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP ABOUT THESE ISSUES. I HAVE WRITTEN A LETTER STATING MY CONCERN FOR MY SAFETY IN THIS CAR. I HAVE GONE TO THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS AND MADE MANY ATTEMPTS AT GETTING THEM TO LISTEN TO ME REGARDING THESE TRANSMISSION ISSUES. I HAVE LEFT THERE SO OFFENDED BY THEM ACTING LIKE THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS CAR WHEN I KNOW THEY KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM. THEY PUT IN BACK ON ME THE DRIVER THAT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DRIVE THE CAR. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR 38 YEARS MOST HAVE BEEN 5 SPEEDS, I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY HOW A CAR IS SUPPOSE TO DRIVE AND FOR THEM TO INSINUATE OTHERWISE IS INSULTING TO ME. AGAIN THIS CAR IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND MORE SO THAN EVER NOW, BECAUSE THE SAFETY LATCHES HAVE MALFUNCTIONED ON THE PASSENGER REAR AND FRONT DOORS. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE AT ALL DRIVING THIS CAR BUT I HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS AS FORD LOW-BALLED ME ON A TRADE IN BECAUSE THEY ARE AWARE OF THESE ISSUES.",
