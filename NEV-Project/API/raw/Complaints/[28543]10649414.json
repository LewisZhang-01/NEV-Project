        "summary": "I HAVE HAD MY VEHICLE IN ON THREE SEPERATE OCCASIONS FOR THE PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG SENSOR COMING ON WHILE A PERSON OVER 100# IS SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.  THE SENSOR LIGHT SAYS THAT THE AIR BAG IS OFF WHILE A PERSON IS SITTING IN THE SEAT.  THEY HAVE RESET THE SENSOR SEVERAL TIMES AND IT IS STILL NOT FIXED.  I AM CONCERNED THAT IF I GET IN AN ACCIDENT MY PASSENGER (USUALLY MY DAUGHTER) WILL NOT BE SAFE BECAUSE THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THE AIR BAG WILL NOT DEPLOY.  I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE ADVISOR THAT IF I WAS THAT WORRIED OR CONCERNED THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE ANYONE SIT IN THAT SEAT AND JUST HAVE THEM RIDE IN THE MIDDLE ROW OR THE BACK ROW.  WHO WOULD SPEND $28,000.00 ON A VEHICLE AND NOT HAVE IT SAFE??  I WAS APPALLED WHEN THE SERVICE ADVISOR TOLD ME THIS.  THIS WILL BE MY LAST NISSAN I EVER PURCHASE.  I ASKED THEM TO REPLACE THE SENSORS AND WAS TOLD THAT NISSAN WOULD NOT AUTHORIZE THIS REPAIR BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHY THE SENSOR IS NOT WORKING.  THE COMPUTER DOES NOT REGISTER FAULT CODES.  I HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL PICTURES WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE SITTING IN THE SEAT WHILE THE SENSOR LIGHT IS ON INDICATING THE AIR BAG IS OFF.  *TR",
