DEALER (LUCAS CHEVROLET) REFUSED TO REPAIR UNDER WARRANTY AND TO GIVE SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WATER GOT INTO SEALED UNIT. WE PAID TO HAVE THE FLUID CHANGED AND DEALER ASSURED THAT THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO REAR END DIFFERENTIAL.    SECOND COMPLAINT WAS THAT THERE WAS A WHINING NOISE COMING FROM THE REAR END AT APPROXIMATELY 20,000 MILES. THE NOISE OCCURED BETWEEN 50 & 70 MPH AND WOULD QUIT WHEN THE GAS PEDAL WAS LET OFF. A DIFFERENT DEALER (JIM REED CHEVROLET) \"REBUILT\" THE REAR END DIFFERENTIAL. NOTE: DEALER WAS VERY HELPFUL IN FIXING PROBLEM.    THE NEXT COMPLAINT WAS THAT AT APPROXIMATELY 23,000 MILES, AFTER THE REAR END DIFFERENTIAL FLUID WAS CHANGED, THE WHINING NOISE CAME BACK. THE DRIVING CONDITIONS WERE THE SAME AS THE SECOND COMPLAINT. THE DEALER (JIM REED CHEVROLET) AGAIN \"REBUILT\" THE REAR END DIFFERENTIAL.    ON THE WAY HOME FROM THE DEALER (JIM REED CHEVROLET) THE REAR END IS STILL WHINING.",
