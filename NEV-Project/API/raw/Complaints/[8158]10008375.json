        "summary": "WE HAVE A 93 HONDA ACCORD EX.  RECENTLY THE LOCKING MECHANISM IN THE DRIVER'S FRONT DOOR STOPPED WORKING.  APPARENTLY A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM AND SPENT HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS FOR THE REPAIR.  THE CAR WAS NOT IN AN ACCIDENT NOR HAS IT EVER SUSTAINED ANY DAMAGE TO THAT DOOR.  NOW YOU CANNOT OPEN THE DRIVER'S DOOR FROM THE INSIDE OR THE OUTSIDE.  THIS IS A SEVERE SAFETY HAZARD.  UNTIL THIS HAPPENED, WE HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPENING TO ANY VEHICLE REGARDLESS OF ITS AGE.  I DO THINK THAT IT IS A DEFECT IN THE LOCKING MECHANISM.  THE DETAILS ON HOW IT STOPPED WORKING FOLLOWS - ONE SNOWY DAY WE OPENED THE DOOR TO GET IN.  NO PROBLEM.  WE THEN PROCEEDED TO START THE CAR AND OPENED THE DOOR ONCE AGAIN TO SCRAPE THE EXTERIOR WINDOWS.  THE DOOR WAS SHUT PROPERLY (NOT SLAMMED).  AFTER SCRAPING THE WINDOWS, WE WENT TO OPEN THE DRIVER'S DOOR AND IT WOULD NOT WORK.  PLEASE TAKE WHATEVER STEPS TO MAKE THIS A RECALL RETROACTIVE BACK FOR THOSE WHO ALREADY PAID TO HAVE IT FIXED.  *NLM",
