        "summary": "MODEL: TOYOTA SIENNA VAN - XLE  YEAR: 1999   MILEAGE : 60600   OTHER OWNERS: THERE ARE MANY OWNERS WHO HAVE THIS ISSUE AS REPORTED IN WWW.CARTRACKERS.COM AND WWW.EDMUNDS.COM - FORUMS.  PROBLEM REPORTED: THE SIENNA TRANSMISSION IS DEFINATELY A PROBLEM IN OUR CASE AS MENTIONED BY TOYOTA DEALER AND MANY OTHER OWNERS AT OR NEAR 60K MILES. THIS IS UNCALLED FOR OF A TOYOTA FOR WHICH WE PAY A PREMIUM. I DODNOT SEE ANY RECALLS AND DEALERSHIP CHARGES MAXIMUM AMOUNT FOR LABOU - IN OUR CASE UPTO $3200.  DETAILS : WE CURRENTLY HAVE A 1999 (5/1999) SIENNA VAN XLE WITH 60600 MILES. THE VAN HAS BEEN PROBLEM FREE UNTIL 2 WEEKS AGO ON THE HIGHWAY THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. THE DEALERSHIP'S INITIAL THE DIAGNOSIS INDICATED CELLULOID FAILURE, THEN WE WERE TOLD TORQUE FAILURE AND THEN YESTERDAY THE TRANSMISSION ITSELF. AND WE WERE CHARGED AT EACH - EVEN THOUGH DEALERSHIP PROBABLY KNEW IT IS TRANSMISSION THAT REQUIRES REPLACEMENT. THIS WAS SHOCKING AS  IT IS JUST 600 MILES OVER THE WARRANTY.FURTHER RESEARCH OF THIS PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET AND VARIOUS FORUMS   AS WELL AS CARTRACKERS.COM IT APPEARS THAT THERE ARE MANY OWNERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED IDENTICAL PROBLEMS AT OR NEAR 60K MILES SOME EVEN EARLIER. I HAD BEEN MAINTAINING THE VAN THRU THE SAME DEALERSHIP (E.G. 15K,30K SERVICE ETC.) AND I DONOT TOW BOATS ETC. SO THERE IS NO ABUSE AS CLAIMED OCCASIONALLY. I THINK THERE IS A REAL ISSUE HERE WITH THE TRANSMISSION.     HOW COME SO MANY HAVE THE IDENTICAL ISSUES AT OR NEAR 60K MILES. THRU THE FORUMS I GATHERED THAT FEW CASES WERE REPORTED AT NHTSA SITE AS SO MANY CANNOT BE WRONG. THUS I WOULD LIKE JOIN THOSE - WHO HAD SIMILAR ISSUES. THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD TAKE THE CHARGE FOR THE ENTIRE COST OF REPLACING THIS OR SHOULD RECALL ALL THE VANS. WE ARE DISAPPOINTED  IN THE PREMATURE FAILURE OF THE TRANSMISSION AS WE BELIEVE THIS TRANSMISSION PROBLEM IS EITHER A MANUFACTURING OR DESIGN DEFECT.",
