I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS PROBLEM AND KNOW THAT GM HAS ISSUED A RECALL ON OTHER MODELS BUT NOT MINE.  PLEASE SEE BELOW:  GM, THE WORLD'S LARGEST AUTO MAKER, SAID IT HAD 15 REPORTS OF CRASHES AS A RESULT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE POWER STEERING, INCLUDING THREE INJURIES BUT NO FATALITIES.  THE LOWER PINION BEARING IN THE POWER STEERING GEAR COULD SEPARATE, GM SAID. MOST REPORTS INDICATED THAT DRIVERS EXPERIENCED AN INTERMITTENT LOSS OF POWER STEERING WHEN TURNING LEFT, USUALLY AT LOW SPEEDS.  SOME DRIVERS COULD EXPERIENCE HIGHER RESISTANCE WHEN TURNING LEFT, FOLLOWED BY AN UNINTENDED POWER ASSIST TO THE RIGHT, GM SAID.        *JB",
