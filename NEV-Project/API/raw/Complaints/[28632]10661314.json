MY CHIROPRACTOR GOT MY BACK SOMEWHAT REPAIRED, BUT MY KNEE ENDED UP HAVING A MENISCUS TEAR THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN REPAIRED.  HYUNDAI IS WILLING TO REPLACE WHAT MY INSURANCE COMPANY PAID OUT FOR MEDICAL CARE AND TO FIX MY CAR.  I WILL BE HAVING MEDICAL ISSUES FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE THANKS TO THIS AIR BAG INCIDENT. I BELIEVE HYUNDAI SHOULD PAY FOR ALL FUTURE MEDICAL ISSUES RESULTING FROM THIS INCIDENT BUT .... THEY INVESTIGATED AND ARE SAYING THAT THE \"COMPUTER SHOWS AN IMPACT SEVERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE THE DEPLOYMENT\" SO THEY ARE WILLING TO REPLACE THE SEAT AND REIMBURSE ONLY THE INSURANCE COMPANY. THEY SAY FUTURE MEDICAL ISSUES ARE MY RESPONSIBILITY. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE THIS WAY.  THEIR PRODUCT CAUSED IT, THEY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE!  *TR",
