I CONTACTED INFINITI AND WAS TOLD THEY NEED TO RESET IT AND WILL COST $800.00 AND MY EXTENDED WARRANTY DID NOT COVER IT AND WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL LIST. THE IPDM ECM RELAY SWITCH CAUSES MY INSTRUMENT CLUSTER GAUGE TO GO IN AND OUT, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON, MY TRUCK JERKS TRYING TO SWITCH GEARS, IT WILL SOMETIMES START UP AFTER SEVERAL TRIES, IT CAUSES THE RPM'S TO READ OVER 7 WHEN I'M ONLY DRIVING 60 MPH. IT SHOULD READ BETWEEN 2 AND 3 RPM'S. I'M CONSTANTLY SWITCHING THE ECM RELAY PLUGS TO START MY TRUCK. THE AIR BAG AND IPDM ECM RELAY WAS NOT COVERED UNDER MY EXTENDED WARRANTY WHEN I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE I PURCHASED IT 4YEARS AGO.",
