TO CHECK FOR POTENTIAL CRACKS IN THE FRAME WELDS, WE RIPPED UP THE FLOOR UP FRONT UNDER THE BED, AND REMOVED THE ALUMINUM UNDER THE HANGOVER TO EXPOSE THE FRAME.  WE FOUND MANY OF THE SCREWS HOLDING THE ALUMINUM ONTO THE FRAME UNDERNEATH HAD RIPPED THROUGH THE ALUMINUM FROM THE FLEXING, AND SOME OF THE ALUMINUM STARTED SEPARATING AT THE JOINTS.  INSIDE, THERE ARE MARKS ON THE WALL ABOUT TWO INCHES HIGH FROM THE PLYWOOD SCRAPING THE WALL AS THE FRAME FLEXES UP AND DOWN.  I KNOW OTHERS WHO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM, AND THINK THE MANUFACTURER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS WIDESPREAD DEFECT.  *TR",
