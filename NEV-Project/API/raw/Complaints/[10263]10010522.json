OIL DRIPS ONTO EXHAUST CAUSING CAUSING MODERATE TO SEVERE SMELL OF BURNING OIL INSIDE AND AROUND VEHICLE.  DEALER MECHANICS WERE ABLE TO LOCATE PROBLEM BY INSERTING SPECIAL DYE IN THE OIL AND CHECKING WITH A BLACKLIGHT, AND STATE HEADS NEED TO BE REPLACED. DEALER DENIES DEFECT AND SUGGESTS THIS AS A NORMAL WEAR ITEM, BUT THERE ARE NO MOVING PARTS.  I AM WORRIED ABOUT COMPLETE FAILURE OF THE SEALS RESULTING IN OIL/OIL PRESSURE LOSS, EXTENSIVE ENGINE DAMAGE AND/OR FIRE.   *NLM",
