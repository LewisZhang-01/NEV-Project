THE TIRES HAD A 50,000 MILE WARRANTY.  WE HAVE HAD THE CAR FULLY MAINTAINED SINCE THE PURCHASE OF THE CAR AND THE TIRES, AND WERE TOLD BY PROFESSIONALS THAT THEY FELT THE TIRES WERE A MANUFACTURER DEFECT.  THEY ALSO TOLD US WE SHOULD REPLACE THE TIRES IMMEDIATELY OR WE COULD BE PUTTING OURSELVES AND OUR CHILD IN DANGER.  WE WENT TO SEARS AND THEY REFUSED TO HELP US AND SIMPLY WANTED US TO BUY A WHOLE NEW SET OF TIRES, EVEN AFTER I SHOWED THEM EVERY RECEIPT I HAD ON THE MAINTENANCE TO PROVE THIS DID NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE OF NEGLECT ON OUR PART.",
