THIS WEEKEND, APRIL 2, 2005, WE WERE HAVING A SAFETY SEAT CHECKPOINT IN CORAL SPRINGS.  WE PURCHASED 36 BOOSTER SEATS (WITH INTERNAL HARNESS SYSTEMS) FROM EVENFLO TO HAVE IN CASE WE NEEDED TO REPLACE A SEAT (WE ALSO PURCHASED 84 CONVERTIBLE SEATS - BUT THEY ARE FINE).   I NEED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DEFECT WITH THE BOOSTER SEATS THAT WE PURCHASED.    HERE IS THE PROBLEM:  IF YOU TAKE THE HARNESS STRAP AND MOVE IT TO THE TOP SLOT (ON THE LEFT SIDE) THERE IS NO PLASTIC \"TOOTH\" TO SNAP THE METAL BAR BACK INTO.  BASICALLY, THERE IS NO WAY TO SECURE THE HARNESS STRAP BEHIND THE SEAT.  IF THE PARENT OR CHILD MOVES THE HARNESS WHILE WEARING THE STRAPS, IT WILL COME OUT OF THE HOLDER IN THE BACK.  *AK   *JB",
