THE CAR CAN BE FULL OF GAS AND IT WILL SHOW IT IS ON EMPTY. WHEN WE FIRST GOT THE CAR THE AIR BAG SIGNS WOULD COME ON AND WE TOOK IT BACK TO GM DEALER AND THEY COULD NEVER FIND ANY PROBLEM. ALSO THE SEAT BELT LIGHT COMES ON AND YOUR HAVE YOUR SEAT BELT ON. THIS CAR HAS ALSO HAS JUST BEEN AT THE DEALERS FOR REPAIR FOR THE ELECTRICAL POWER STEERING PROBLEMS, VERY SCARY. IT CONCERNS ME ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THIS CAR DYING ON YOU IF YOU ARE ON THE HIGHWAY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON WITH  THIS CAR ARE STRANGE AND THINGS LIKE THE FUEL GAUGE, POWER STEERING YOU WOULD THINK  YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH. I THINK THAT THERE IS A RECALL ON THE FUEL PUMP AND I WAS JUST WONDERING IF IT HAD ANY THING TO DO WITH THE FUEL GAUGE NOT WORKING. THEY SURE DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THEY USED TO.   *TR",
