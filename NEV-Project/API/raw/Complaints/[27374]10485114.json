I PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR HARDER AND THE VEHICLE LURCHED INTO GEAR, AND COMMENCED UP THE HILL FROM MY HOUSE - THE CAR THEN APPEARED TO GO INTO NEUTRAL ON ITS OWN, THUS NO PROPULSION, THEN ON ITS OWN SLIPPED BACK INTO GEAR.  AS I MADE MY WAY ONTO THE MAIN ROAD, I PROCEEDED CAUTIOUSLY UNSURE IF THE CAR WOULD STALL OUT OR IF I WOULD EVEN MAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP.  I DID MAKE IT, BUT ALONG THE WAY THE CAR SLIPPED IN AND OUT OF GEAR INDISCRIMINATELY SEVERAL TIMES, LEAVING ME WITHOUT POWER FOR SEVERAL SECONDS AT A TIME.  WHAT IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN ON THE HIGHWAY AT 65 MPH?    I DROVE IN THE BREAKDOWN LANE WITH MY FLASHERS ON TO AVOID BEING HIT FROM BEHIND.  MY DEALERSHIP ARUNDEL FORD HAS HAD THE CAR IN THE SHOP SINCE THAT DAY, AND HAS AGREED TO REPLACE THE CLUTCHES, BUT TELLS ME THE PARTS ARE NOT GOING TO BE AVAILABLE UNTIL DECEMBER 11 AT THE EARLIEST.  THIS IS COMPLETELY UNSATISFACTORY.  I HAVE VERY LITTLE FAITH THAT THE CAR WILL EVER BE SAFE TO DRIVE.  *TR",
