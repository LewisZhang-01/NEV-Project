I CALLED MOTOR IMPORTS IN HONOLULU, HAWAII AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY WOULD NOT COVER THE DEFECTIVE PART.  ABOUT ONE YEAR EARLIER, THE HANDLE FOR THE LATCH TAILGATE SNAPPED.  I HAD TO GO TO A REPAIR SHOP TO REPLACE BOTH THESE PARTS BECAUSE THE DEALER REFUSED TO REPLACE FOR FREE.  I AM SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY.  THE TAILGATE MAY BE THE ONLY ESCAPE ROUTE FOR REAR PASSENGERS AND THERE IS NO INTERIOR LATCH TO OPEN THE TAILGATE.  IF THE REAR EXTERIOR LATCH BREAKS OFF, THERE IS NO WAY TO OPEN THE TAILGATE.  WHEN MY DRIVER INTERIOR DOOR HANDLE SNAPPED, I REALIZE HOW DANGEROUS THIS VEHICLE CAN BE IN AN ACCIDENT ESPECIALLY WHERE EXITING THE VEHICLE IS IMPORTANT SUCH AS A FIRE OR IN THE WATER.",
