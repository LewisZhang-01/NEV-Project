TWO WEEKS AFTER MY WARRANTY WAS OVER, PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG WENT OFF, BRUISING MY 250 LB MALE FRIEND.  DRIVER'S SIDE AIR BAG DID NOT DEPLOY.  THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT INVOLVED, I WAS JUST DRIVING INTO A DRIVEWAY.  BOTH SEAT BELTS DO NOT WORK.  CALLED MY CASE MANAGER AND HE SAID I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IT MYSELF.  I AM DISABLED FEMALE AND DRIVING WITHOUT SEAT BELTS THAT COULD RESULT IN A HEFTY FINE.  PLEASE ADVISE.  THANK YOU.  *TR",
