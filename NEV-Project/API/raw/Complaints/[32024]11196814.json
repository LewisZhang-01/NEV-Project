WATER RUNS INSIDE THE VEHICLE, HAS IMPACTED THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS IN THE ROOF TOP AND IS A HAZARD TO DRIVER AND PASSENGERS SINCE WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN DAY TO DAY. THIS WAS CLEARLY A POOR DESIGN CHOICE AND JEEP SHOULD REPAIR AND REPLACE EVERY SINGLE CLOTH ROOFTOP THAT HAS BEEN COMPROMISED. THE COST IS PROHIBITIVE AND WILL LIKELY FAIL AGAIN DUE TO THE DESIGN.",
