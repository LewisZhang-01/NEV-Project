HAD TO AVOID ACCIDENTS MANY TIMES WHEN CRUISING TO STOP AND HITTING EITHER A DIP,SMALL OR LARGE POTHOLE,SLIGHT IMPERFECTION IN ROAD SERVICE WILL CAUSE ABS TO ENGAGE (BRAKE PETAL DOPS AND ABS STARTS) ESPECIALLY ON DOWNHILL BREAKING. I WILL INCLUDE 1 INCIDENT DATE BECAUSE THAT IS ALL YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO DO ON THE FORM. PROBLEM IS REPEATABLE AND HAPPENS OFTEN (2-3 TIMES A WEEK) I KNOW THIS IS NOT JUST MY CAR OR A PROBLEM RELATED TO ONLY MY CAR IT IS ALREADY KNOWN, SUBARU KNOWS OF PROBLEM. YET DOES NOT OFFER A SAFE SOLUTION. I ACTUALLY FOUND THIS OUT THE HARD WAY 2 MONTHS AFTER GETTING MY NEW CAR THE RS MODEL.NO INJURIES LUCKILY.  FROM WHAT I HEAR FROM SUBARU CLUBS THIS HAPPENS WITH OTHER MODEL YEARS AS WELL. SUBARU OF AMERICA HAS BEEN VERY STUBBORN TO CORRECT THIS ISSUE.    *NLM",
