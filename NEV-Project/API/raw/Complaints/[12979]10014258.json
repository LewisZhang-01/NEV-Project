I HAVE SEARCHED THE NET AND I HAVE FOUND THE HEAD GASKET LEAK PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL IS SHARED BY OTHER NUMEROUS OWNERS AS WELL. IT IS APPARENT THAT FORD NEEDS TO RECALL THE 1996 WINDSTAR GASKET LEAK AS THEY DID ON THEIR 1995 MODEL. FORD HAS IMPLIED THE GASKET HAS BEEN REPAIRED ON THE 1996 MODEL. MY VAN IS A TESTAMENT  THE DEFECT ON THE HEAD GASKET HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD MY COMPLAINT TO YOUR LIST AND HOPEFULLY FORCE FORD TO EXTEND THE RECALL TO THE 1996 MODEL AS WELL.    *JB",
