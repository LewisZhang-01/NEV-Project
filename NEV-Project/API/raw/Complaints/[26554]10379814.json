AT 40,000 MILES IT FULLY FAILED, IN THE FULLY DOWN POSITION IT BLOCKS A TALL PERSONS FIELD OF VISION.  I RESORTED TO SEWING VELCRO TO TO THE VISOR AND CEILING TO HOLD THE VISOR IN PLACE.  NOW AT 60,000 MILES THE PASSENGER VISOR IS STARTING TO DROOP, AND NOT RETURN TO THE FULL UPRIGHT POSITION.  THE PASSENGER VISOR IS USED A FRACTION OF THE AMOUNT OF THE DRIVER VISOR; THEREFORE IS EXPERIENCING THE PROBLEM LATER.  IT APPEARS THAT INFERIOR SPRINGS HAVE BEEN USED.  ONLINE FORMUMS INDICATE THIS PROBLEM GOING BACK TO 2006 MODELS.  *LN",
