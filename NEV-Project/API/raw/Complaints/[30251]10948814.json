        "summary": "I HAVE A 2015 JEEP CHEROKEE LATITUDE, 6 CYL.  EVER SINCE I DROVE IT OFF THE LOT, IF AT A COMPLETE STOP AND ACCELERATE TO ENTER TRAFFIC THERE IS A NOTICEABLE LONG PAUSE WHEN I GUN IT.  MANY TIMES I HAVE HAD TO PULL TO THE SIDE TO AVOID GETTING HIT.  ALSO WHEN ACCELERATING ON THE EXPRESSWAY WHEN HITTING THE GAS, THE VEHICLE PAUSES BEFORE ACCELERATING.  THIS ALSO HAS CAUSED NEAR COLLISIONS WITH OTHER VEHICLES DUE TO THE LONG PAUSE BEFORE FINALLY  ACCELERATING.  I HAVE TOLD THE DEALER ABOUT THE PROBLEM EVERYTIME I GO THERE FOR AN OIL CHANGE.  THEY HAVE UPDATED THE COMPUTER SYSTEM MANY TIMES WITH NO RESULTS ON FIXING THE PROBLEM,  THEY TELL ME THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS ISSUE.  THE 9-SPEED TRANSMISSION HAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS I AM TOLD, AND THEY STILL HAVE YET TO FIND A REAL SOLUTION.  SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET KILLED THINKING THEY CAN PULL OUT IN FRONT OF TRAFFIC ONLY TO FIND THE VEHICLE HAS A LONG HESITATION BEFORE ACCELERATING.  I WAS PLANNING ON GIVING THIS CAR TO MY SON, BUT THERE IS NO WAY I WOULD LET HIM DRIVE THIS VEHICLE WITH THE ABOVE MENTIONED ISSUE.  THE DEALER HAS TOO LONG IGNORED, OR ARE IGNORANT OF THIS POTENTIAL LIFE THREATENING ISSUE WITH ACCELERATION PROBLEMS.  OTHER THAN THAT ISSUE THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN DECENT.  *TR",
