        "summary": "ABOUT 8 MONTHS AGO I PURCHASED A 2000 FORD FOCUS. THIS PAST WEEKEND MY STEERING WHEEL LOCKED UP. I COULDN'T EVEN GET THE KEY ALL THE WAY INTO THE IGNITION. I TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO START THE CAR TO NO AVAIL. I WENT ONLINE TO FIND OUT IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER TECHNIQUES I COULD TRY AND CAME ACROSS SEVERAL WEBSITES WITH DISGRUNTLED CONSUMERS WHO ARE ALSO OWNERS OF THE FORD FOCUS. THEY ALL ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM. I'VE BEEN TOLD BY BOTH THE DEALERSHIP AND LOCKSMITH THAT THE PROBLEM IS THE TUMBLERS AND A FAILED CYLINDER DUE TO FORD. APPARENTLY FORD USED A SUBSTANDARD MANUFACTURED CYLINDER WHICH RAPIDLY DETERIORATES WITH USE AND EVENTUALLY FRACTURES THUS LOCKING THE WHEEL. I WAS TOLD AT THE DEALERSHIP THAT THE REPAIR WOULD BE CLOSE TO $400 SO I OPTED INSTEAD TO HAVE A LOCKSMITH COME OUT. THAT COST ME $60. I'M TOLD THOUGH THAT IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE IT HAPPENS AGAIN AND EVEN A NEW CYLINDER WILL NOT PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN BECAUSE THE PART ITSELF IS DEFECTIVE. APPARENTLY FORD IS WELL AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM BUT WILL NOT DO A RECALL WHICH I FIND ABSURD. THIS IS NOT ONLY AN ANNOYING SITUATION BUT ALSO A DANGEROUS ONE. I'VE HAD OTHER FORD OWNERS TELL ME THAT THEY'VE HAD THIS PROBLEM HAPPEN TO THEM WHILE DRIVING, AT STOP LIGHTS, IN A PARKING LOT ETC. THAT IS DANGEROUS AND SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT IT. I AM WRITING A PERSONAL LETTER TO FORD...AND I PLAN TO TAKE THIS AS FAR AS I POSSIBLY CAN LEGALLY.    THANK YOU.  AMY KENNEDY  WINSTON SALEM, NC     *JB",
