WE HAVE A 2001 TOYOTA TUNDRA WITH ONLY 120,000+MILES ON IT THAT NOW HAS A RUSTED OUT WHOLE THE SIZE OF MY FIST IN ITS FRAME. I DO NOT HAVE A PHOTO TO ATTACH, BUT CAN GET ONE IF NEED BE. WE'VE TALKED TO THE DEALER AND TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE, THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE LOOKED UP THE VIN AND SAID IT WASN'T PART OF THE RECALL. WHY? IOWA IS A COLD WEATHER STATE! THIS TRUCK CAME THRU PRINCETON IN. HOW COME TOYOTA GETS TO DECIDE WHAT STATES THE RECALL APPLIES TO? ACCORDING TO THE TUNDRA RECALL BLOG, HTTPS://WWW.TUNDRAS.COM/THREADS/2000-TUNDRA-FRAME-REPLACEMENT.7215/, THEY ARE STILL FIXING TRUCKS IN NEW YORK AS OF 2018. DOESN'T IOWA COUNT? HOW MANY OTHER TRUCKS ARE OUT THERE ON OUR HIGHWAYS WITH THE SAME ISSUE?  *JS *TT    'PARTS OF THIS DOCUMENT HAVE BEEN REDACTED TO PROTECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).'*JB",
