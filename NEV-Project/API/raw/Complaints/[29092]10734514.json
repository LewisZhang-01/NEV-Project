        "summary": "I HAVE HAD THIS 2007 PACIFICA SINCE 2009, BOUGHT IT WITH 12,000 MILES ON IT. IT NOW HAS 109,000 MILES. IN THE PAST YEAR THE CAR HAS STALLED INTERMITTENTLY WHEN SLOWING DOWN AT STOPS, TOOK IT IN, NO PROBLEM FOUND. IT HAS ALSO HAD LIGHT SMOKE COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD INTERMITTENTLY SINCE I BOUGHT IT, HAD IT LOOKED AT SEVERAL TIMES, NO PROBLEM FOUND. THIS WEEK I WAS DRIVING THE CAR AT @30ISH MPH WHEN IT STALLED ON A BUSY ROAD, BUT WAS LUCKILY ABLE TO TURN OFF THE ROAD WITH NO POWER STEERING SAFELY. IT HAS BEEN AT THE DEALERS FOR 3 DAYS AND NO PROBLEM FOUND AT THIS POINT. I HAVE CHILDREN AND NO LONGER FEEL SAFE DRIVING THEM IN THIS VEHICLE. IF THER IS \"NO PROBLEM\" TO FIX, THAT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM, BECAUSE A CAR STALLING WAITING TO BE HIT AND SOMEONE INJURED, IS A PROBLEM!!! I HAVE CALLED CORPORATE AND AWAITING TO SPEAK WITH A CASE MANAGER ABOUT THIS ISSUE, BUT FROM WHAT I HAVE READ ONLINE, IF THE DEALERSHIP CANNOT MIMIC THE ISSUE, THEN CORPORATE WILL LIKELY SAY THERE IS NO PROBLEM. I CANNOT JUST WAIT TO SEE IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN, AND NEXT TIME ON THE HIGHWAY AS I HAVE READ IN OTHER CASES, WHEN SOMEONE COULD BE HURT! ALSO CONCERNED WITH THE \"NO PROBLEM\" WHEN IT SMOKES UNDER THE HOOD, AS I HAVE READ A COUPLE OF INCIDENTS WHERE THE CAR CAUGHT FIRE. HAVE A RENTAL CAR NOW...HOPE CORPORATE DOESN'T BLOW ME OFF!",
