        "summary": "I PURCHASED MY 2014 FIAT 500L IN MARCH 2019 WITH ONLY 54,000 MILES ON IT. A COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER, I WAS ALMOST HIT BY ONCOMING TRAFFIC WHILE ATTEMPTING TO CROSS TRAFFIC AT AN INTERSECTION WHEN THE TRANSMISSION FAILED TO ENGAGE FIRST OR SECOND GEAR. AS I FRANTICALLY PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR TO GET THE CAR TO ACCELERATE, THE ENGINE REVVED TO APPROXIMATELY 5000 - 6000 RPMS UNTIL THE TRANSMISSION FINALLY ENGAGED A GEAR AND I WAS ABLE TO GET OUT OF HARMS WAY.  THERE WERE AT LEAST TWO MORE VERY CLOSE, ALMOST ACCIDENTS, JUST LIKE THE ONE DESCRIBED ABOVE; AS WELL AS OTHER INCIDENTS THAT HAPPENED SUCH AS CHANGING LANES IN A TRAFFIC JAM AND NOT BEING ABLE TO ACCELERATE, ETC. APPROXIMATELY FIVE MONTHS LATER (LAST WEEK), WHILE SITTING IN A TRAFFIC JAM FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES, I BEGAN SMELLING A BURNING SMELL. SHORTLY AFTER, WHILE INCHING FORWARD, THE CAR JUMPED; ALMOST FELT LIKE I HAD BEEN HIT FROM BEHIND. THIS HAPPENED TWICE. ABOUT FIVE - TEN MINUTES LATER, A MESSAGE DISPLAYED SAYING TO PLACE THE CAR IN NEUTRAL THEN BACK INTO DRIVE OR REVERSE. I DID THIS AND THEN ALARMS STARTED DINGING AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER, WHEN TRAFFIC FINALLY STARTED TO MOVE, THE TRANSMISSION WOULD ONLY GO INTO 2ND, 4TH, AND 6TH GEARS. WHEN I TRIED TO USE THE MANUAL SHIFT MODE, IT SAID GEAR NOT AVAILABLE. I MANAGED TO GET MY CAR HOME AND TO THE DEALERSHIP THE NEXT MORNING WHERE THEY DIAGNOSED THE TCM AS BAD (CODE P1CB1). IT COST ME $1,221.51 TO FIX!  THERE WAS A COMPLETED GEAR SHIFT MODULE RECALL (NHTSA # 14V-103) IN MARCH 2014 AND A COMPLETED REPROGRAM POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE RECALL (NHTSA # 17V-192) IN MARCH 2017. FIAT HAS FAILED MISERABLY TO FIX THIS TRANSMISSION ISSUE AND THERE'S STILL REPEATED PROBLEMS AND COMPLAINTS. THEY DID NOTHING FOR ME WHEN I CONTACTED THEM! IT IS A SAFTEY ISSUE! DOES SOMEONE HAVE TO DIE BEFORE THIS IS RECALLED? BECAUSE I COULD HAVE!",
