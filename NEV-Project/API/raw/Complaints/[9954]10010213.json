SLIGHT DEFORMATION TO THE BUMPER, A SMALL DENT AND BROKEN TURN SIGNAL LENS ON RIGHT FENDER.  SHE WAS WEARING THE SEAT BELT AND SHOULDER STRAP, YET SUSTAINED A BROKEN NOSE AND BROKEN CHEEK BONE FROM HITTING THE STEERING WHEEL.  NO AIRBAGS DEPLOYED.  THE SHOULDER STRAP DID NOT PREVENT FORWARD MOTION.  WHERE CAN I GET THIS VEHICLE EXAMINED AND WHAT INFORMATION DO YOU HAVE REGARDING THESE SPECIFIC DEVICES?  THANK YOU, VERY MUCH. *JB",
