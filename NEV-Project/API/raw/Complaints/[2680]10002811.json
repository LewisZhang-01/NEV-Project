        "summary": "HAVE HAD VEHICLE IN FOR BRAKE SERVICE 9X IN 2 YRS. ONLY 20 K MILES ON CAR.(2000 KIA SPORTAGE). 13 TIMES TOTAL FOR SERVICE . REPLACED ROTORS 3X AND NOW HAVE PROBLEMS AGAIN. THE DEALERSHIP YORK CHRYSLER KIA HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. THE FRONT WHEEL BEARINGS WERE LOOSE 3X. THEY TOLD US THEY NEVER SEEN THIS HAPPEN BEFORE. BUT IT HAPPENED 3X TO US. THE 4 WHEEEL DRIVE WENT OUT. THEY SAID IT HAPPENS SINCE THERE IS NO DIRT SHIELD ON THE LINKAGE. THEY INSTALLED A RETROFIT KIT TO PROTECT AGAINST THIS BUT ONLY DO IT IF PEOPLE HAVE PROBLEMS. I THINK THEY ARE TRYING TO GET OUT OF HAVING A RECALL ON THIS ITEM. WITH OUR KIA THEY REPLACED THE ENTIRE BRAKE ASSEMBLEY AFTER ONLYU 3206 MI. WE HAD THE CAR IN 3X AFTER THAT FOR BRAKE SQUEEL WHICH WAS EXCESSIVE. THEY COULD NOT FIX IT. THEY REPLACED THE ROTORS AGAIN AT 10456 MILES. AT 12552 MILES THE 4 WHEEL DRIVE WENT OUT. AT 15882 MI THEY CHECKED AGAIN FOR BRAKE PULSATION AND BALANCED FRONT TIRE AND WHEEL ASSEM. SAID BRAKE AND ROTOR RUNOUT WELL WITHIN SPECS. AT 17488 HAD ROTORS REPLACED AGAIN. NOT EVEN 2K MILES AFTER THEY SAID EVERYTHING WAS WELL WITHIN SPECS. AT 20473 MILES BRAKE ROTOR WERE PULSING AGAIN. THEY WOULD NOT COVER UNDER WARRANTY. AFTER TALKING WITH KIA (CASE #K129955) THEY AGREED TO MACHINE THE ROTORS AGAIN USING THE ON CAR LATHE TO GET A BETTER FINISH. AT 20783 COMPLAINED ABOUT BRAKE PULSING AGAIN. AND AM GOING TO TAKE THE VEHICLE IN AGAIN TO FIND OUT WHAT IS GOING ON. I THINK THERE IS AN UNDERLING PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE THAT THEY CANNOT FIGURE OUT. AT 7571 MI, 13777MI, AND AGAIN AT 20783 MI, THE WHEEL BEARINGS WERE LOOSE. THIS IS NOT NORMAL WEAR JUST LIKE THE ROTORS.",
