        "summary": "ON SEPTEMBER 30TH, I TOOK MY JETTA IN TO VALENTI VOLKSWAGEN TO HAVE A NEW AND UPDATED ECU INSTALLED.  THE UNIT WAS IN STOCK, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM RICK IN PARTS AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO COME IN THAT DAY TO HAVE IT PUT IT.   WHEN I ARRIVED, I WAS TOLD BY THE TECHNICIAN THE ECU IN MY CAR HAD TO BE SENT TO VOLKSWAGEN TO BE REPROGRAMMED AND THAT I HAD TO GET A RENTAL CAR WHILE THE ECU WAS OUT.  I GOT A CALL FROM SERVICE ON OCTOBER 12TH LETTING ME KNOW MY CAR WAS READY TO BE PICKED UP. WHEN I ARRIVED, I WAS TOLD MY ECU WAS STILL AT VOLKSWAGEN BEING REPROGRAMMED. THE SERVICE MANAGER WAS ABLE TO GET A NEW AND UPDATED ECU IN THE MEAN TIME. I DON''T KNOW WHY THEY JUST DIDN''T INSTALL THE ECU THEY HAD IN STOCK ON SEPTEMBER 30TH. I HAD TO PAY A TOTAL OF 119.88 TO ENTERPRISE FOR THE RENTAL VEHICLE. I''VE CALLED IN TO VOLKSWAGEN CARE NUMEROUS TIMES REGARDING THIS COMPLAINT AND NOTHING WAS RESOLVED. I TOLD THE REPS I SPOKE TO I WANTED AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY MY CAR WAS NOT REPAIRED ON THE 30TH WHEN I BROUGHT IT IN. IT TOOK ALMOST TWO WEEKS TO FIX IT AND I HAD TO PAY FOR THE RENTAL CAR, WHICH WAS UNNECESSARY. A COPY OF THIS HAS BEEN SENT TO J.D. POWER AND ASSOCIATES FOR THEIR REVIEW.  SINCERELY,  ROBERT TAYLOR",
