THEY ARE LOADED WITH GAS, PROPANE TANKS, GIVE LITTLE OR NO DRIVING INSTRUCTIONS AND DO NOT HAVE TO SUBMIT TO STATE SAFETY INSPECTIONS!  I HAVE A DETAILED CASE OF RENTING A DEFECTIVE AND DANGEROUS VEHICLE AND GETTING ABUSED BY THE RENTAL COMPANY (THE LARGEST ONE IN THE US).  I EVENTUALLY FILED ARBITRATION WITH THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION AS REQUIRED PER THEIR RENTAL CONTRACT.  THEY IGNORED THE AAA FORCING THE AAA TO SIMPLY CLOSE THE CASE AS THEY HAVE NO MORE AUTHORITY THAN TO DENY THE USE OF THEIR NAME IN FUTURE CONTRACTS.  THEY REGISTER THEIR TRUCKS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH HAPPENS TO HAVE A VERY LOOSE LAW REQUIRING THAT THE VEHICLE ONLY PASS ONE INSPECTION WHEN FIRST PUT ON THE ROAD.  THEN THEY FLOAT THESE VEHICLES ALL OVER THE US AND NEVER HAVE TO GET AN INSPECTION AGAIN!  HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE RENT THEM, ABUSE THEM AND THEY NEVER EVEN HAVE TO GET THEIR BRAKES CHECKED!  THIS SHOULD BE ILLEGAL.  I HAVE ALLL OF THE DETIALS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST.  PLEASE WARN DRIVERS THAT IF THEY SEE A BIG RV COMMING UP IN THEIR REAR VIEW MIRROR, GET OUT OF ITS WAY!",
