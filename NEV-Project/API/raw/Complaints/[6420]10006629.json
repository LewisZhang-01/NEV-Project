        "summary": "WHEN WE BOUGHT THE VAN IN APRIL OF 2001 THE TRANSAXLE WOULD NOT SHIFT INTO REVERSE WHEN COLD.  THE VEHICLE HAS APPARENTLY BEEN WARMED UP BEFORE WE TEST DROVE IT.  THE TRANSMISSION FILTER AND FLUID WERE REPLACED AND THE TRANSMISSION WAS FINE UNTIL THE NEXT COLD SEASON .  THE FLUID AND FILTER WERE REPLACED AND THE TRANSMISSION WAS FINE UNTIL THE NEXT COLD SEASON.  THE FLUID AND FILTER WERE REPLACED AGAIN BUT IT DID NOT HELP.  THE TRANSMISSION STARTED OUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR'S COLD SEASON JUST NOT GOING INTO REVERSE WHILE COLD, THEN IT QUICKLY PROGRESSED TO NO FIRST GEAR OR REVERSE WHILE COLD.  DURING THE TIME WHEN IT HAD NO FIRST OR REVERSE THE TRANSMISSION WOULD GO INTO LIMP MODE. (CHRYSLER A-604 ULTRADRIVE) DURING THIS TIME THE TRANSMISSION ONLY FUNCTIONS IN SECOND GEAR (WHILE THE GEAR SELECTOR IS IN OVERDRIVE).  THE TRANSMISSION REPAIR SHOP ACTED VERY SURPRISED THAT OUR TRANSMISSION LASTED 135K MILES! UNFORTUNATELY OUR WARRANTY COMPANY IS NOT AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS TRANSMISSION OR JUST DOESN'T WANT TO LOSE MONEY BECAUSE OF IT, BUT THEY ONLY PAID FOR THE INSTALLATION OF A USED TRANSMISSION WITH 80K MILES.  I USE THE ULTIMATE WARRANTY COMPANY (1-800-576-5113).   *JB    ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*****770786",
