        "summary": "I RENTED A U-HAUL FROM A U-HAUL VENDOR BEST VALUE INN IN NEPTUNE, NJ ON DECEMBER 24TH. WHEN I RENTED THE TRUCK THERE APPEARED TO BE NO PROBLEMS. ON THE MORNING ON DECEMBER 26TH AFTER THE TRUCK WAS LOADED I WAS LEAVING MY HOME IN WALL, NJ TO DRIVE TO FORT LAUDERDALE, FL FOR COLLEGE. WHEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN SOMETHING AT HOME I TURNED AROUND. I NOTICED THAT THE TRUCK SEEMED TO BE MAKING AN ODD NOISE WHEN I TURNED BUT ASSUMED THAT IT WAS CAUSED BY THE WEIGHT IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. I ARRIVED HOME AND NOTICED THAT THE SKIRT OF THE TRUCK WAS PUSHED UP AGAINST THE TIRE. I CONTACTED U-HAUL AND THEY SENT OUT A REPAIR SERVICE THEY CONTRACTED WITH. THE REPAIR SERVICE SAID THAT AN AXLE WAS BROKEN ON THE TRUCK WHICH WOULD HAVE CAUSE THE TRUCK TO CRASH ESPECIALLY IF I HAD NOT BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE FORGOTTEN SOMETHING AT HOME. AFTER HOURS LATER WE FINALLY GOT A NEW TRUCK WHICH SET UP BACK RESORTING IN HAVING TO SPEND ADDITIONAL MONEY ON A HOTEL AS WELL AS GAS SINCE WE HAD ALREADY PUT GAS IN THE FIRST TRUCK. I AM GOING AWAY TO COLLEGE AND NOT ONLY DO I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MY SAFETY BUT NOW MORE ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS I CAN NOT AFFORD. AFTER WEEKS ON BEING SENT BACK AND FORTH WITH U-HAUL TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE I AM FINALLY CONTACTED BY THERE MARKETING PRESIDENT PAUL KELLY. PAUL TELLS ME THAT IT WAS MY FAULT, THAT I CAUSED THE DAMAGE AND THAT HE WILL NOT DO ANYTHING TO COMPENSATE ME AND WOULD NOT CONDUCT A FURTHER INVESTIGATION OR RELEASE ANY INFORMATION TO ME EVEN REGARDING AN INVESTIGATION. ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS GET TO FLORIDA, SAFE, WITH NO PROBLEMS, AND ATTEND MY FIRST WEEK OF SCHOOL NOT ACCUSED WHEN I WAS NOT AT FAULT AND HAD TO SPEND ADDITIONAL EXPENSES NOT TO RELATED TO THE COST OF MY TRIP. U-HAUL ADMITTED BLAME IN THE BEGINNING AND IT SHOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS COMPANY TO UPHOLD THERE CONTACTS AS WELL AS PUBLIC SAFETY STANDARDS WHICH THEY CHOOSE TO DISREGARD. THERE OWN MECHANIC STATED HIMSELF THAT IT WAS CAUSED BY A LOOSE BOLT WITH DOCUMENTATION! *TR",
