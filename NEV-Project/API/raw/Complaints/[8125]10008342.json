WE TURNED THE CAR OFF AT THIS POINT, BUT IT CONTINUED TO RISE,  FINALLY AFTER ABOUT 10 MINUTES OF TRYING TO RELEASE THE WINDOW MY WIFE WAS IN SUCH PAIN THAT I WAS FORCED TO BEND THE WINDOW AND IT SHATTERED RELEASING HER ARM. SHE WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHERE SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A BAD SPRAIN. I THANK GOD THAT I WAS THERE TO HELP AND THAT MY SEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS NOT THERE AT THE TIME AS SHE ALWAYS SITS IN HER CAR SEAT IN THE REAR SEAT. THANK YOU. *JB",
