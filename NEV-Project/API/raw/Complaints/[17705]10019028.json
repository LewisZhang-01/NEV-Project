NUMEROUS POSTS ON INTERNET FORUMS, INCLUDING THE MANUFACTURER SPONSORED MINI OWNER'S SITE REVEAL AN INCREASING NUMBER OF WINDSHIELDS DEVELOPING APPARENT STRESS FRACTURES. MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND THAT OF OTHERS IS THAT THE WINDSHIELD OF THE MINI HAS A PROPENSITY TO CRACK UNDER NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS. DEALERS OFTEN DENY WARRANTY CLAIMS, POINTING TO THE SMALLEST OF IMPERFECTIONS AS \"IMPACT SITES\" AND PASSING REPLACEMENT COSTS ON TO OWNER'S COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE. THIS, DESPITE NO HISTORY OF SPECIFIC IMPACTS WITH ANY OBJECTS WHILE DRIVING.  AGAIN IN MY PARTICULAR CASE, THE FRACTURE APPEARED OVERNIGHT WHILE THE CAR WAS GARAGED.   *NLM",
