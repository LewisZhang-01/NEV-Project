        "summary": "I BOUGHT MY 2008 FORD FUSION SEL (V-6) FROM THE LOCAL FORD DEALER IN 2009 - THE CAR SPENT THE FIRST YEAR OF ITS LIFE AS A RENTAL CAR. I JUST WATCHED A FEATURE ON CNN ABOUT FORD FUSIONS BRAKES FAILING ON OCCASION. SEVERAL TIMES SINCE I'VE OWNED MY FUSION, THE BRAKES HAVE FAILED WHEN PULLING HEAD-ON INTO A PARKING SPOT - NEVER HAS THIS HAPPENED DURING A ROUTINE STRAIGHT-ON STOP. WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE ENGINE ALSO REVS UP, MAKING STOPPING EVEN MORE DIFFICULT. THE CAR LURCHES 2 TO 3 FEET BEFORE COMING TO A STOP. I HAVE ATTRIBUTED (GUESSED) THE PROBLEM TO BE THE BRAKE PEDAL GOING DOWN TOO FAR CAUSING MY OVERLAPPING SHOE TO CONTACT THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL (THE TWO PEDALS ARE VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER). I'M 75 YEARS OLD AND HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR 64 YEARS AND I HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED A PROBLEM LIKE THIS WITH ANY VEHICLE; I'VE BECOME VERY APPREHENSIVE WHEN DRIVING MY FUSION BECAUSE OF THIS RANDOM PROBLEM. MY FUSION IS ALSO UNDER A TAKATA AIR BAG RECALL - I RECEIVED A LETTER SEVERAL MONTHS AGO FROM FORD, BUT HAVE HEARD NOTHING SINCE.  *TR",
