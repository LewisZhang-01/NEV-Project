THIS VEHICLE CURRENTLY HAS 37,000 MILES ON IT.   GM WILL NOT FIX BECAUSE THEY SAY THE WARRANTY IS UP.   I FEEL THIS IS A DEFECT AND SHOULD BE RECALLED.  I HAVE READ  THAT THE SYSTEMS ON THE NEWER VEHICLES HAVE BEEN IMPROVED BECAUSE THE ONE I HAVE IS SUBSTANDARD FOR THE VEHICLES.  THE COST TO REPAIR THIS SYSTEM IS CONSIDERABLE, WHEN I QUESTIONED THE DEALER THEY COULD NOT GIVE ME AN ACCURATE SUM BECAUSE AS THEY GOT FURTHER INTO FIXING IT THERE IS NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW MUCH IT WILL COST UNTIL IT WAS DONE.  WHO IS TO SAY IT WOULD WORK PROPERLY WHEN THEY FINISHED AND I WOULD HAVE SPENT WELL OVER A THOUSAND DOLLARS. *JB",
