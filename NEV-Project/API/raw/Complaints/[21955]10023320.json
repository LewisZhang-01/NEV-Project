        "summary": "COMPLAIN I OWN A 1996 TOYOTA CAMRY THAT RECENTLY EXPERIENCED AN ENGINE DAMAGE DUE TO THE BUILD-UP OF OIL SLUDGE BEFORE 80,000 MILES. MY CAR HAS THE SAME 2.2L 4 CYLINDER ENGINE AS THEIR CAMRY 1997-2001 MODELS, WHICH TOYOTA AGREED TO COVER THE COST OF REPAIRING THOSE ENGINES. HOWEVER, DESPITE THE FACT THAT MY CAR HAS THE SAME ENGINE AND IT WAS PRODUCED TWO MONTHS PRIOR TO THAT TIME FRAME, BECAUSE IT IS IN A 1996 MODEL, TOYOTA HAS REFUSED TO COVER THE COST OF REPAIRING IT. THERE IS NO DISPUTING THAT THE FAILURE OF THOUSANDS OF THESE ENGINES AS A RESULT OF A BUILD-UP OF OIL SLUDGE CAN BE ATTRIBUTABLE ONLY TO THE FACT THAT THESE ENGINES ARE DEFECTIVE. AS SUCH, IT IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS THAT TOYOTA SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE REPAIR OF SOME OF THESE DEFECTIVE ENGINES AND NOT OTHERS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. PETER XU.   *NLM",
