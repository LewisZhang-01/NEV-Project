        "summary": "SINCE WE DROVE THIS CAR OFF THE LOT, IT HAS BEEN PLAGUED WITH ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS.  AS SOON AS OUR WARRANTY RAN OUT, THE TRANSMISSION FAILED AT 44,400.  TWO ADULTS AND 4 CHILDREN WERE ON OUR WAY TO A 4TH OF JULY CELEBRATION WHEN THE TRANSMISSION STALLED AT AN INTERSECTION.  LUCKY FOR US ALL TRAFFIC WAS STOPPED AND NO MAJOR ACCIDENT OCCURRED.  WE TOOK IT TO OUR DEALER AND ASKED FOR ASSISTANCE SINCE THERE WAS A TSB OUT ON THE TRANSMISSION IN FORD WINDSTAR'S.  WE WERE DENIED ASSISTANCE.  OUR PROBLEM WAS THE ALUMINUM PISTON THAT WERE REPORTED IN THE TSB. IN MAY 2001, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND WE TOOK IT TO A FORD DEALER.  THEY REPLACED THE IRMC VALUE. COST $1000.  RECENTLY, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN AND SMOKE WAS COMING OUT OF THE TAIL PIPE.  WE TOOK IT TO CROSSROADS FORD, THE DEALER WE BOUGHT THE CAR FROM. THEY ONCE AGAIN DENIED TO HELP US WITH THE COST.  WE TOWED THE VAN TO A QUALITY FORD IN DURHAM, NC.  THEY HAVE CONTACTED FORD TO SEE IF THEY WILL ASSIST US WITH THE COST.  THE ESTIMATED COST IS $3500-$4000. *JB    ****DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER ARTEMIS****761964",
