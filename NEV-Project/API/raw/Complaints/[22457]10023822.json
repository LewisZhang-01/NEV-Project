ONCE I PULLED INTO OUR HOTEL I NOTICE A RATTLING COMING FROM THE LEFT FRONT HUB CAP.  WHEN I PULLED THE HUBCAP OFF THREE OF THE LUG NUT SUDS WERE SHEARED OFF.  FORD FIXED THE PROBLEM BUT COULD NOT TELL ME WHY THIS HAPPENED.  THIER THEORY IS THAT THE TIRE WAS NOT PROPERLY PUT BACK ON.  THE ONLY TIME THE TIRE WAS OFF WAS IN JULY OF 2002.  MY FEELING IS THAT IF THE WHEEL WAS NOT PUT ON PROPERLY IT WOULD NOT TAKE A YEAR TO NOTICE.  I MAY BE WRONG BUT I WANT TO BRING THIS TO YOUR ATTENTION IN CASE THERE ANY OTHER INSTANCES OF THIS HAPPENING.  THANK YOU.  *AK",
