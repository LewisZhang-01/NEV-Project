        "summary": "DATE IS APPROXIMATE.  1994 FORD AEROSTAR REAR ENDED AT STOP LIGHT HARD ENOUGH TO BREAK 7X19 CABLE HOLDING SPARE TIRE, AND SEND VEHICLE INTO CAR IN FRONT OF IT WITH ENOUGH FORCE TO BREAK RADIATOR AND AC RADIATOR.  AIR BAG DID NOT DEPLOY.  APPROXIMATLY 3 MONTHS AFTER BACK FROM REPAIRS, THE AIRBAG LIGHT STARTED BLINKING OCCASIONLY.  THIS CONTINUED GETTING WORSE UNTIL IT BLINKED CONSTANTLY, ALSO THE HORN WAS INTERMITTENTALY OPERATIONAL.      I CHECKED YOUR \"SEARCH COMPLAINTS\" SECTION AND SEE SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM EVEN WITHOUT THE ACCIDENT.  I HAD THE VEHICLE REPAIRED AND IT WAS THE CLOCK SPRING AS SEVERAL PEOPLE STATE IN THE COMPLAINTS SECTION.  IN FACT THIS MUST BE COMMON DUE TO WHEN I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP THAT DID THE ORIGINAL REPAIRS THEY DIDN'T EVEN LISTEN TO ALL THE INFORMATION ON THE PROBLEM AND SAID \"IT SOUNDS LIKE THE CLOCK SPRING AND TAKES ABOUT 2 HOURS TO REPAIR.\"  THEN QUOTED A PRICE, ONLY MISSING THE PRICE QUOTE BY THE AMOUNT OF TAX ADDED TO THE BILL!    PLEASE RESEARCH THIS, IF NOTHING ELSE LOOK AT YOUR OWN SYSTEM UNDER AIRBAGS, HORN, AND SPEED CONTROLS!  DOESN'T TAKE A BEAN COUNTER TO SEE THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THIS \"SAFETY\" SYSTEM!!!!!!!*JB",
