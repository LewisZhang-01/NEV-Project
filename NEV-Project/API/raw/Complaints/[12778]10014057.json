        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING ON I75 FROM NAPLES, FL TO FT. LAUDERDALE, FL,  THE DRIVER SIDE LEFT FRONT TIRE BLEW AT 70 MPH.  THE TREAD THAT MEETS THE PAVEMENT SEPARATED FROM THE SIDEWALL.  THIS TIRE IS A KUHMO 195/70 R14 90H MODEL 722 ORIGINAL FACTORY TIRE ON MY 1999 HYUNDAI SONATA WITH ONLY 25,000 MILES ON THE TIRES.  BEFORE ANY ROAD TRIP, I CHECK TIRE PRESSURE FOR SAFETY PURPOSES.  MY CAR BODY HIT THE PAVEMENT A FEW TIMES BEFORE COMING TO A STOP RESULTING IN LEFT FRONT FENDER DAMAGE.  THIS FENDER WILL COST AROUND $700 TO REPLACE.  I FEEL VERY UNSAFE WITH THESE TIRES AND THE COST TO REPLACE ALL 4 TIRES IS AROUND $300.  THIS WAS A VERY DANGEROUS AND FRIGHTENING SITUATION, NOT ONLY FOR ME BUT ALSO FOR THE OTHER VEHICLES PASSING ME ON THE HIGHWAY AS THE CAR WAS VIBRATING VIOLENTLY AS THE TIRE BLEW.  IT WAS ALL I COULD DO TO HOLD ON TO THE STEERING WHEEL AND KEEP THE CAR IN MY LANE AS THE CAR CAME TO A STOP.  I SENT AN EMAIL TO KUHMO VIA THEIR WEBSITE AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED A REPLY.  *JB",
