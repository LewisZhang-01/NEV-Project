        "summary": "I HAVE HAD MULTIPLE UNPLANNED SERVICE VISITS. MY NISSAN FRONTIER SC IS 18 MONTHS OLD. THE GAS TANK NEEDED TO BE REPLACED DUE TO IMPROPER INTERNAL GEOMETRY. THIS CAUSED FUEL TO GUSH OUT OF THE TANK AFTER FILLING...CERTAINLY A SAFETY HAZARD. THE FUEL LEVEL INDICATION INSTRUMENT SHOWED INCORRECT FUEL LEVEL AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY  A SAFETY ISSUE, BUT IS STILL AN ISSUE, NONETHELESS. AN ABS SENSOR FAILED, WHICH RENDERED THE TRUCKS ABS SYSTEM INOPERABLE...ALSO A CRUCIAL SAFETY ISSUE. I HAVE HAD TWO FRONT END ALLIGNMENTS AND HAVE ALREADY REPLACED ALL FOUR TIRES ON THE TRUCK AFTER ONLY 33,000 MILES. THIS COULD ALSO POTENTIALLY LEAD TO UNSAFE TRAVEL. LAST, BUT NOT LEAST, THE PASSENGER SIDE POWER WINDOW MECHANISM FAILED. ALL OF THESE CONDITIONS WERE REMEDIED BY THE DEALER. BUT, AFTER BEING NOTIFIED OF ALL OF THESE ISSUES WITH ONE OF THEIR NEW VEHICLES, NISSAN HAS ONLY RESPONDED WITH A GENERIC, \"SORRY.\"",
