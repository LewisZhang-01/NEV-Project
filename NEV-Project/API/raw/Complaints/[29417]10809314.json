THIS ISSUE OCCURRED LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER PURCHASE (297 MILES ON THE ODOMETER AT THE TIME THAT THE ISSUE OCCURRED).  SPECIFIC ISSUE: WHEN THE TRANSFER CASE WAS SET TO \"AUTO\" IT AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHED TO THE \"4WDLO\" SETTING, WHICH CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO LOCK-UP SPECIFICALLY WHEN TURNING OR IN REVERSE GEAR.  I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THE TRANSFER CASE CONTROL MODULE SOFTWARE NEEDED TO BE UPDATED / REFLASHED AND THAT THE ENCODER MOTOR /  ACTUATOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  THE DEALER CONTACTED GM AND WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE ENCODER MOTOR / ACTUATOR WAS ON NATIONAL BACKORDER.  THE DEALER RECEIVED AND INSTALLED THE PART ON 12/8/15 (25 DAYS AFTER THE ISSUE OCCURRED).  I FORMALLY SUBMITTED A COMPLAINT TO GM ON 11/20/15 (REF # 8-1674527570) SO THEY ARE AWARE OF THE ISSUE.",
