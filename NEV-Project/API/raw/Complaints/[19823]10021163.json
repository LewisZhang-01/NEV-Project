I HAD THEM INSPECTED AND FOUND THAT THE PIVOT BOLT (RECLINER BOLT) ON BOTH SIDES WERE BROKE OFF.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAYS THEY HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE AND THAT THIS WAS VERY UNUSUAL.  I LOOKED UNDER YOUR WEBSITE AND FOUND THAT AN INVESTIGATION IS OPEN AS OF 5/21/03 REGARDING SIMILAR SITUATIONS.  IF IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FOR ME BEING CONCERNED ABOUT US FALLING TO THE BACKSEAT SOMEDAY DUE TO THEIR LOOSENESS, A SEVERE INJURY COULD MAYBE HAVE OCCURRED JUST LIKE ONES FILED IN THE COMPLAINTS YOU HAVE ON FILE..  I GOT THE SITUATION REPAIRED (COSTING ME $77.13).  THE SERVIE DEPARTMENT EVEN GAVE ME THE BOLTS TO SHOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  I FEEL THIS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED ALSO AND MAYBE I SHOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR REPAIRING THIS BEFORE A SEVER INJURY DID OCCUR.  *AK",
