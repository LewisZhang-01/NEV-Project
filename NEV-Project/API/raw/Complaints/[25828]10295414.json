        "summary": "I WENT TO MY CAR ON A COLD MORNING AND FOUND A CRACK WHICH WAS NOT THERE WHEN I PARKED THE CAR THE NIGHT BEFORE.  IT WAS A LINEAR CRACK ABOUT 6 INCHES LONG EXTENDING STRAIGHT FROM THE MIDDLE BOTTOM OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD.  NO EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING STRIKING THE WINDSHIELD OR CAR.  NO DEBRIS.  NO OBVIOUS CHIP.  I DROVE TO DEALER THE NEXT AND THEY TRIED TO TELL ME THERE WAS A \"CHIP\", WHICH WAS SMALLER THAN A PINHEAD WHICH THEY FELT INDICATED THAT IT WAS AN IMPACT FRACTURE.  WHEN PRESSED ON WHY IT WASN'T A THERMAL OR STRESS FRACTURE, THE SERVICE MANAGER EVEN ONCE SAID \"YES, IT'S A THERMAL FRACTURE, BUT IT WAS CAUSED BY AN IMPACT.  THE AREA WHERE THE \"CHIP\" WAS  ABOVE THE ORIGINAL EXTENT OF THE ORIGINAL CRACK AND WAS IN A REGION OF SPREAD WHICH DEVELOPED LATER, AFTER DRIVING THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THAT CAN HAPPEN, WITH THE CRACK STARTING AT A POINT SEPARATE FROM THE IMPACT SITE.  THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CRACK IS ABOUT 18 INCHES CURRENTLY.  THE SERVICE MANAGER, GENERAL MANAGER, AND REGIONAL SERVICE MANAGER ALL CLAIM THAT THIS IS A IMPACT FRACTURE AND REFUSE TO COVER IT UNDER THE WARRANTY.  THE SERVICE MANAGER AVOIDS PHONES CALLS.  THE GENERAL MANAGER REFUSES TO GIVE ME A WRITTEN ATTESTATION THAT THIS IS AN IMPACT FRACTURE AND REFUSES TO DEAL WITH ME.  THE REGIONAL SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE CANNOT BE CONTACTED AND DOES NOT DEAL WITH CONSUMERS.  THE HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE SAID THAT I COULD TAKE IT TO A DIFFERENT DEALER, BUT WARNED THAT THEY PROBABLY ANSWER TO THE SAME DISTRICT SERVICE MANAGER. *TR",
