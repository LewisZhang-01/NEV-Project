WE JUST STARTED USING IT IN AUGUST 2002 BECAUSE OUR CHILD OUTGREW THE OTHER EVENFLO CARRIER TYPE SEAT.  WHEN VERY COLD OUTSIDE, THE BUCKLE IS HARD TO UNLATCH TO REMOVE MY CHILD.  WE HAVE TO HOLD THE RED RELEASE BUTTON WHILE PULLING UP HARD ON THE BAR. EVENFLO WAS NOTIFIED OF THIS AND SAID THERE IS NOTHING THEY COULD DO BECAUSE THE 1 YEAR WARRANTY IS UP.  SHE SUGGESTED THAT WE BLOW IT OUT WITH A AIR HOSE.  I HAVE CLEANED THIS OUT WITH THE VACUUM BEFORE.  IT USUALLY ONLY STICKS WHEN IT IS VERY COLD.  MY CHILD DOES NOT EAT WHILE IN THE CAR SO FOOD/DRINK IS NOT THE PROBLEM.  I THINK THIS COULD POSE A DANGEROUS PROBLEM IF ANY ACCIDENT OR EMERGENCY WOULD OCCUR. *JB",
