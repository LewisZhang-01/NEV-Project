        "summary": "ON 04-26-2003 MY FAMILY AND I  WERE LEAVING THE DETROIT METRO AIRPORT PARKING GARAGE.  WE HAD JUST LEFT OUR PARKING SPOT WHEN WE PASSED OVER WHAT I ASSUMED WAS A SPEED BUMP GOING APPROXIMATELY 5 MPH HEADING TOWARD THE TICKET BOOTH WHICH WAS JUST AHEAD.  AS WE PASSED THIS SPEED BUMP OUR AIR BAGS SPONTANEOUSLY DEPLOYED FOR NO APPARENT REASON.  THERE IS NO DAMAGE TO OUR VEHICLE THAT WOULD JUSTIFY THE AIR BAGS GOING OFF AS THEY DID.  WE HAVE INFORMED OUR DEALERSHIP OF THIS PROBLEM, AS WE FEEL THAT THE AIR BAGS ARE FAULTY, AND THEY ALSO AGREED AT THAT TIME THAT THERE WAS NO CAUSE FOR THE AIR BAGS TO DEPLOY.  I SPOKE TO THE SERVICE MANAGER, [XXX] AT THE M-59 DODGE DEALER WHO SAID THAT WE WOULD BE CONTACTED AND THE MATTER INVESTIGATED.  I SPOKE TO A [XXX]. , WITH THE CHRYSLER INVESTIGATIONS DEPT WHO STATED TO ME THAT THEY DETERMINED THAT THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYED FROM IMPACT WITH A SPEED BUMP AND NO FURTHER ASSISTANCE WOULD BE FORTHCOMING.  WE FEEL THAT THIS SHOULD BE LOOKED AT AS A POSSIBLE PROBLEM IN THE AIR BAG SYSTEM AND AT THE LEAST HAVE THE CAR FIXED, AS OUR DASH BOARD IS ALL TORE APART AT THIS TIME, MAKING THE CAR VIRTUALLY UNDRIVABLE.  WE HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS  ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AS THIS COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN A WORSE SITUATION IF WE HAD BEEN DRIVING HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND PASSED A BUMP OR HIT A POT HOLE AND THESE BAGS HAD DEPLOYED,CAUSING LOSS OF CONTROL AND A POSSIBLE  ACCIDENT/FATALITY. THE VEHICLE INVOLVED IS A 1997 DODGE GRAND CARAVAN, VIN # [XXX].    *NLM    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
