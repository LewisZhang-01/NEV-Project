        "summary": "THE CRUISE CONTROL SELECTOR ON THE 2001 MAZDA PROTEGE IS A SHORT STALK ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE STEERING WHEEL. ONCE THE CRUISE CONTROL IS ENABLED BY PRESSING A BUTTON IN THE END OF THE STALK, THE CRUISE SPEED IS SELECTED BY MOVING THE STALK DOWN. IF CRUISE IS INTERRUPTED, AS BY STEPPING ON THE BRAKE PEDAL, THE PRE-SET SPEED CAN BE RESUMED BY MOVING THE STALK UP.    SINCE THE STALK CHANGES LOCATION WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE STEERING WHEEL, IT IS VERY EASY TO INADVERTENTLY OPERATE THE STALK. I HAVE HIT IT WHEN ATTEMPTING TO OPERATE THE WINDSHIELD WIPER/WASHER (ANOTHER STALK ON THE RIGHT SIDE) AND WHILE TURNING A CORNER.    THE HAZARD IS THAT THE ENABLED CRUISE CONTROL IS NOT DISABLED IF THE VEHICLE DROPS BELOW A CERTAIN SPEED, STOPS, OR EVEN WHEN THE IGNITION IS TURNED OFF. IT REMAINS ENABLED UNTIL INTENTIONALLY TURNED OFF. A DRIVER, UNAWARE THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS ENABLED, COULD ACCIDENTALLY MOVE THE STALK UP TO RESUME, AND THE VEHICLE WOULD ACCELERATE TO THE LAST PRE-SET SPEED. EVEN THOUGH A TAP OF THE BRAKE PEDAL WOULD INTERRUPT THE ACCELERATION, BY THE TIME THE DRIVER REALIZED IT AND REACTED, A LOT OF DAMAGE COULD BE DONE. A DRIVER COULD ALSO ACCIDENTALLY MOVE THE STALK DOWN AND UNKNOWINGLY SET THE CURRENT SPEED AS THE CRUISE SPEED. IF THE DRIVER LIFTED HIS/HER FOOT FROM THE GAS PEDAL, THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT DECELERATE AS EXPECTED BUT WOULD CONTINUE AT THE SET SPEED.",
