ROAD CONDITIONS WERE WET AND SNOWY THE WHOLE TRIP. I DON'T THINK I EVER EXCEED 60 MPH. I CHECKED ALL TIRES FOR PROPER INFLATION BEFORE LEAVING MY HOME FOR NEW JERSEY. THE TIRES ARE 60,000 MILE TIRES AND HAD ABOUT 43000 AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE.    THE TIRE IS A BRIDGESTONE DUELER H/T 689 - THIS IS NOT SHOWN IN YOUR SELECTION LIST. I HAD TO SELECT THE CLOSEST NAME BUT THE REAL NAME IS THE ONE WRITTEN HERE. *TR",
