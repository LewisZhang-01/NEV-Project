PAINT IS STARTING TO CHIP ALONG THE FRONT EDGE OF BOTH   PASSENGER DOORS.)  I  LIVE IN WI & BOUGHT VEHICLE NEW ON DECEMBER 11, 2003.  SO THAT MEANS THERE IS SNOW ON THE GROUND UNTIL, AT LEAST EARLY, APRIL.   SO OUT OF THE FIVE MONTHS THAT I HAVE BEEN MAKING PAYMENTS ON THIS EXPENSIVE VEHICLE...THREE OF THEM HAVE BEEN DURING THE WINTER WHEN THERE AREN'T A LOT OF STONES, PEBBLES, ROCKS, ETC.  I REALIZE THERE COULD BE SOME PAINT CHIPPING...BUT MY GOODNESS!!!  I HAD  TRADED-IN MY 1996 MAXIMA FOR THIS UPGRADED MODEL!!!  MY 1996 DIDN'T HAVE PAINT CHIPS THAT WERE CHIPPED TO THE METAL OF THE VEHICLE!!!    *NLM",
