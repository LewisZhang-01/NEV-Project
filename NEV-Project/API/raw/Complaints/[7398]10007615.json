        "summary": "I AM THE NOT SOO HAPPY OWNER OF A 2000 CHRYSLER SEBRING JXI CONVERTIBLE.  THE LATEST PROBLEM WITH THIS POOR EXCUSE FOR  RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION IS THAT NOW NONE OF THE 3 KEYS THAT CAME WITH THE CAR ARE ABLE TO TURN THE LOCK CYLINDER EVEN WHEN ALL OTHER PREREQUISITES ARE ENABLED. AAA SENT OUT A LOCKSMITH WHO PROVIDED ME WITH A NEW KEY WHICH MUST BE USED IN CONJUCTION WITH THE ORIGAINAL COMPUTER CHIP KEYS, BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS HAS NOT RESOLVED THE PROBLEM. THE LOCKSMITH INDICATED TO ME  THAT HE IS CALLED OUT FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM FOR MANY CHRYSLER MODELS AND ADVISED ME TO CHECK FOR A MFG RECALL, WHICH I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS ONE FOR THIS PROBLEM.  HE ALSO INDICATED THAT THE PROBLEM IS BECAUSE OF A DEFECT IN THE LOCK CYLINDER.  I  HOPE THIS HELPS YOU IN YOUR EFFORTS.   THANK YOU.",
