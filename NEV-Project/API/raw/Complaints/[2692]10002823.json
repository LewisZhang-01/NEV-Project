BROUGHT THE VAN IN TO HAVE THEM FIND OUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING, THEY PUT DYE IN THE OIL TO TRACK AN OIL LEAK WHICH WAS LEAKING ON THE EXHAUST DIRECTLY BEHIND THE ENGINE. RETURNED A WEEK LATER TO FIND OUT THEY BELIEVED IT WAS THE TIMING COVER AND ORDERED PARTS TO REPLACE THE GASKET. RETURNED A WEEK LATER AND LEFT VAN TO BE REPAIRED. TWO DAYS LATER WE PICKED THE VAN UP AND DROVE HOME. THE NEXT DAY THE SMELL WAS BACK. CALLED THE DEALERSHIP BACK AND HAD TO SCHEDULE ANOTHER APOINTMENT (A WEEK LATER) WHICH THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT FIND ANY LEAK. THERE IS FLUID (POSSIBLY TRANSMISSION FLUID ) LEAKING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ENGINE. I HAVE ANOTHER APOINTMENT SCHEDULED TO RETURN FOR OTHER ISSUES SUCH AS THE DASH LIGHTS FLICKERING ON AND OFF WHEN VEHICLE IS COLD, AND A THUMPING NOISE IN THE FRONT OF VEHICLE. THIS VAN ONLY HAS 14000 MILES ON IT AND I DO NOT NEED IT TO CATCH ON FIRE...",
