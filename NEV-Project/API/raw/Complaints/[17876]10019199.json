I HAVE HAD SEVERAL CLOSE CALLS WITH OTHER CARS AND OBSTACLES BECAUSE THE STEERING SEEMS TO HAVE A MIND OF IT'S OWN AT TIMES AND WILL SWERVE AND WANDER IN DIFFERENT WAYS BASED ON ROAD CONDITION, IF I'M BRAKING OR ACCELERATING. I TOOK IT INTO THE DEALER FOR DIAGNOSTICS AND THEY TOLD ME THAT MY STEERING BOX AND TRACK BAR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED TO THE TUNE OF $1400. THIS IS ON A $30K+ TRUCK WITH 40K MILES ON IT! I HAVE CONTACTED CHRYSLER AND COMPLANED ABOUT THIS CONDITION AND THEY WON'T REVIEW IT UNTIL I HAVE IT BACK AT THE DEALER FOR ANOTHER INSPECTION THEN THEY WILL DECIDE IF THEY WILL OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE OR NOT. BASED ON RESEARCH ON THE WEB THIS IS A FREQUENT PROBLEM WITH THE DODGE TRUCKS.",
