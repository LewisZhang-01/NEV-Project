        "summary": "SUBJECT: REAR WINDOW \"EXPLODED\".  I CLOSED THE TAILGATE, NOT THE WINDOW, AND BY THE TIME I WAS 2-3 STEPS AWAY, THE WINDOW \"EXPLODED\". THE CAR WAS PARKED FOR ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE OPENED AND I CLOSED THE TAILGATE DOOR, THEN THE WINDOW CHATTERED INTO PIECES THAT FLEW IN ALL DIRECTIONS. I ONLY OPENED AND CLOSED THE DOOR, I DID NOT OPERATE OR TOUCH THE WINDOW BUT IT CHATTERED. IT WAS THE FIRST AND ONLY DOOR I HAD OPENED WHEN IT HAPPENED. GLASS FLEW IN ALL DIRECTIONS IN LITTLE PIECES LIKE 8 FEET AWAY ON THE OUTSIDE AND LIKE 3 FEET ON THE INSIDE. THE SOCK ABSORBERS ARE STICKING OUT OF THE WINDOW AND ARE TOO HARD TO RETRACT AND CAN'T BE PUT BACK INSIDE THE CAR. THE REAR WIPER ASEMBLY IS HANGING AND THE HEATER ELEMENTS ARE DANGLING TOO. THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE WAS AROUND THE 40'S AT AROUND 10:40 PM. NOTHING COULD'VE TOUCHED THE GLASS AT THE TIME OF CLOSING DOOR SINCE I ONLY HAD A CHARCOAL BAG LAYING FLAT ON THE CARGO AREA WITH A SMALL BOX OF ALUMINUM FOIL, A SMALL TOOLBOX (LIKE 4\" X 8\" X 12\"), ALSO LAYING FLAT ON THE CARGO AREA FLOOR, AND A SMALL BLANKET.  *TR",
