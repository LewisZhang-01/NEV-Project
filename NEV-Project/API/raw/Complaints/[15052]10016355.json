TOOK IT TO THE DEALER 3 TIMES, FIRST TIME THEY REPLACED THE HOSES, SECOND TIME REPLACED THE STEERING COLUMN, AND THE THIRD TIME THEY STATED THIS WAS A PROBLEM WITH A PIECE OF METAL IN THE COLUMN THAT VIBRATES DUE TO A SMALL GAP WITHIN THE STEERING COLUMN.  I WAS TOLD THIS WOULD BE A FEW MONTHS, HOWEVER, 6 MONTHS HAVE NOW PASSED AND I STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM.  ONE SIDE NOTE, IT SEEMS TO DO IT LESS IN COLDER WEATHER!   *NLM",
