        "summary": "THE BRAKE PEDAL IS SEVERAL INCHES HIGHER THAN THE GAS PETAL IN THIS VEHICLE. IT SLOWS DOWN REACTION TIME WHEN REACTING TO AN EMERGENCY SITUATION. I WAS BACKING INTO A PARKING SPACE. A VEHICLE WENT AROUND ME. I NOTICED THE VEHICLE, BUT WHEN I TRIED TO QUICKLY MOVE MY FOOT TO THE BRAKE MY FOOT GOT HUNG UP ON THE BRAKE PEDAL. THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT WITH NO INJURIES. THE ACCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF I WAS ABLE TO HIT THE BRAKES. AFTER THE ACCIDENT I SAT IN THE PARKING LOT TO ANALYZE AND CORRECT MY MUSCLE MEMORY AND PRACTICE MOVING MY FOOT QUICKLY FROM GAS TO PEDAL. I REALIZED IT TOOK MUCH EFFORT, CONCENTRATION  AND QUITE A STRETCH TO GET GET MY FOOT TO THE PEDAL QUICKLY. THE PEDALS SHOULD BE EVEN, OR VERY CLOSE TO EVEN. I DON'T KNOW WHY SOMEONE WOULD THINK THIS IS BETTER, BUT IF IT'S A PREFERENCE THERE SHOULD BE AN ADJUSTMENT. EVEN SHOULD BE THE FACTORY DEFAULT. IT'S COMMON SENSE YOU CAN MOVE MORE QUICKLY STRAIT ACROSS THAN UP AND OVER. THE UNADJUSTIBLE FACTORY POSITION IS OK FOR STANDARD TRAFFIC SITUATIONS, BUT WHEN IN AN UNEXPECTED ENERGENCY SITUATION IT SLOWS DOWN YOUR REACTION TIME CONSIDERABLY.  MAZDA SAYS IT'S NORMAN AND ALL NEW CARS ARE THIS WAY. I SAID THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT CORRECT OR ANY LESS OF A SAFETY CONCERN. WHY MAKE A CHANGE THAT SLOWS DOWN REACTION TIME?  *TR",
