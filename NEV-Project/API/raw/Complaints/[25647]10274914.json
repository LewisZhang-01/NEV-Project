        "summary": "PURCHASED 2007 SATURN AURA IN JULY OF 2008. IMMEDIATELY HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKES AND STEERING WHEEL. THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS INCLUDED; THE CAR NOT STARTING UP TWICE IN THE DEAD OF WINTER RESULTING IN IT BEING TOWED ONCE AND JUMPED ONCE, THE BRAKES SQUEAK UNBELIEVABLY LOUD AND THE STEERING WHEEL SHAKES, THE ENGINE STALLS WHEN APPLYING MORE PRESSURE ON THE GAS PEDAL, THE MOTOR IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT BLEW OUT, THE ALARM REMOTE WILL LOCK THE DOORS WHEN IT FEELS LIKE IT, WHEN PUT IN THE PARKING GEAR THE CAR CONTINUED TO ROLL FORWARD WHEN MY FOOT WAS RELEASED OFF OF THE BRAKE PEDAL RESULTING IN THE CAR BEING TOWED, WHEN PUT IN PARK ON A SLIGHT DECLINE THE CAR WOULD NOT REVERSE BUT ONLY ROLLED FORWARD. THIS RESULTED IN THE CAR BEING TOWED AGAIN. EACH TIME THE CAR WAS TOWED I WAS GIVEN A RENTAL AND HAD TO PAY FOR THE GAS WHICH WAS AN EXTRA EXPENSE I SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH. THE POWER OUTLET FOR CELL PHONE CHARGERS DID NOT WORK SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR. WHEN THE CAR WAS TOWED BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT START UP, THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT THEY \"COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE STALLING.\" THIS WAS THE RESULT EACH TIME. HOWEVER, A SHIFTER CABLE WAS REPLACED, BUT DID NOT HELP AS THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED WITH THE CAR NOT GOING INTO REVERSE. ALSO WHEN THE CAR WAS TOWED BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT REVERSE OR PARK, THEY SAID \"COULD NOT DUPLICATE.\" *TR",
