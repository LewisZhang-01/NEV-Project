THE LUNGE WAS SO POWERFUL THAT I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. TOOK IN FOR SERVICE 5/29. THEY REPROGRAMMED THE TCM MODULE.      WOBBLE CAME BACK & BY JUNE 8TH IT WAS WOBBLING & HESITATING (ONCE IT HAPPENED IN AN INTERSECTION). I CALLED SERVICE DEPT ON JUNE 9TH. TOOK IT IN ON JUN 10TH TO HAVE ONE OF THEIR GUYS TAKE IT FOR A SPIN. WHILE WAITING, THEY TOLD ME JEEPS DO \"CERTAIN THINGS OTHER CARS DON'T\". I TOLD THEM I SEARCHED THE INTERNET & APPARENTLY THERE IS A KNOW PROBLEM & BROUGHT A PRINTOUT OF SOME OF THE OTHER CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS. THEY SAID \"CAN'T GO BY THAT\"... I RODE WITH THEIR TECH & HE SAID HE NEVER FELT ANYTHING LIKE THAT. HE GOT HIS SERVICE MANAGER SO THEY GO TAKE IT FOR A RIDE TOGETHER. THEY REPLACED THE AXLES (6/12) BUT SAID THE WOBBLE IS STILL THERE. THEY'D CONTACTED CHRYSLER VIA EMAIL & WAS TOLD NOT TO DUMP ANYMORE PARTS IN THE VEHICLE. THEY KNOW WHAT THE ISSUE IS (BUT THEY WOULDN'T TELL THE DEALER) & A TCB WAS COMING OUT IN AUG. THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE UNTIL THEN. THEY SAID (IN THEIR EMAIL) THE CAR WAS SAFE TO DRIVE.  REALLY?    TOOK CAR BACK ON 7/3.  WORK WAS DONE THE SAME DAY, THEY REPROGRAMMED THE TCM AGAIN. ON THE WAY HOME I STOPPED TO GET GAS & WHEN LEAVING THE GAS STATION THE CAR LUNGED ME INTO THE ROAD! BY 7/7 THE WOBBLE WAS MORE INTENSE. BY 7/8 CAR WAS SLOW TO ACCELERATE FROM A STOP, COULD BARELY KEEP UP WITH TRAFFIC. CALLED CASE MANAGER ON 7/9 SAID WHATEVER THEY DID MADE IT WORSE. HIS SOLUTION WAS TO TAKE BACK IN FOR SERVICE BECAUSE I CAN'T DRIVE A CAR LIKE THAT! HE CALLED TO MAKE APPOINTMENT AND THE EARLIEST THEY HAD WAS 7/20 (11 DAYS LATER).     THESE CARS ARE UNSAFE & SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET HURT! PLEASE DO SOMETHING!",
