        "summary": "GOOD MORNING,  I AM WRITING TO YOU TO LET YOU KNOW ABOUT MY DISSATISFACTION WITH HYUNDAI MOTORS.  I HAVE CONTACTED HYUNDAI MANY TIMES SEEKING SATISFACTORY RESOLUTION TO MY COMPLAINT ON MY 2001 SANTA FE. THE SANTA FE WAS SOLD TO ME ADVERTISING 181 HORSEPOWER. THIS HOWEVER, IS NOT TRUE, AND I AM STILL WAITING TO HEAR FROM THEM.  I HAVE OFFERED HYUNDAI MANY SOLUTIONS THAT I CONSIDER SATISFACTORY TO MYSELF, AND AT THE SAME TIME MAINTAINING MY RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM.  I AM VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY HYUNDAI IS HANDLING THE VALID COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE WHO, IN GOOD FAITH, PURCHASED A VEHICLE THAT IS NOT WHAT IT WAS ADVERTISED TO BE. I AM VERY UPSET WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS MATTER IS BEING IGNORED.   HYUNDAI DID HOWEVER, SET THEIR OWN DEADLINE OF SEPT 2003 FOR CLOSURE TO ALL AFFECTED BY THIS FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. THIS LEADS ME TO WONDER IF THEY ARE PURPOSELY DRAGGING THEIR FEET TO FORCE OWNERS OF THESE AFFECTED VEHICLES IN TO RESOLUTION THAT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE BE ACCEPTABLE.   THE VEHICLE IS NOT WHAT I PAID FOR AND THE LACK OF CONCERN FROM HYUNDAI IS VERY UNSETTLING TO ME. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ALMOST 10 PERCENT LESS HP THAN ADVERTISED. THE AFFECT IT COULD HAVE ON THE SAFETY AND OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE VEHICLE IS SCARY. THE VEHICLE HAS A CERTAIN TOWING CAPACITY AND TORQUE. THIS ALSO HAS TO BE AFFECTED BY THIS. YOUR ASSISTANCE IS GREATLY APPRECIATED.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION.   HAVE A GREAT DAY.   SINCERELY,   STEVE COOPER       26MAY03   *TT",
