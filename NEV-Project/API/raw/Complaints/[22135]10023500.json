I HAVE REPLACED ROTORS AND/OR BRAKES PADS AT LEAST EVERY 3000 TO 5000 MILES SINCE THEN BECAUSE I JUST DID NOT HAVE THE TIME TO PLAY THE DEALERS GAMES.  IT GETS SO BAD THAT I HAVE TO PUMP THE BRAKES EVERY TIME AND THE FRONT END OF THE CAR VIBRATES LIKE IT IS FALLING APART ESPECIALLY GOING DOWN HILL, HAVE TO START PUMPING THE BRAKES AT THE TOP OF THE HILL IN ORDER TO STOP SAFELY.  AND TO TOP THAT OFF, I CALLED TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO TAKE MY CAR IN AGAIN LAST SUMMER AND THE DEALERSHIP HAS GONE OUT OF BUSINESS.  THIS HAS GONE ON WASTING MY MONEY FOR OVER THREE AND A HALF YEARS, IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR I HAD AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF MY BRAKES, I DID NOT HAVE AMPLE TIME TO APPLY THE BRAKES WHEN ANOTHER DRIVER PULLED OUT IN FRONT OF ME, THANKFULLY NO ONE WAS HURT, I HAD THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF DAMAGE.  MY QUESTION IS WHY DOES THIS GO ON, WHY HAS MITSUBISHI NOT RECALLED THESE CARS TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM OR ARE THEY NOT ABLE TO CORRECT IT?  DO THEY NOT HAVE THE PROPER KNOWLEDGE TO LOCATE AND CORRECT THE PROBLEM? DOES SOMEONE HAVE TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED BEFORE SOMEONE AT MITSUBISHI GIVES A [XXX] ABOUT THE POOR CONSTRUCTION AND POSSIBLE INADEQUATE PARTS USED IN THE BRAKING SYSTEM OF THESE CARS??  FROM WHAT I AM ABLE TO FIND OUT THESE PROBLEM STILL EXIST EVEN ON THE BRAND NEW GALANT'S, WHAT IS THE DEAL??    *NLM    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
