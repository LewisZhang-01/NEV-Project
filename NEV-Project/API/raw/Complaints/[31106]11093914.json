FIRST TIME I'M DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT 65 MPH, AND ENGINE ON CAR COMPLETELY SHUTS DOWN, DRIVING WHEEL LOCKS OR POWER STEERING GETS LOST AND BRAKE PEDAL STOPS WORKING GETS VERY STIFF AND ALL THIS HAPPENED ON A STATE HIGHWAY. ALL THAT CAN BE DONE IS LET THE CAR COME TO A COMPLETE STOP IN ITS OWN ALL WHILE USING ALL MY FORCE TO TRY MY BEST TO STEER CAR AWAY FROM TRAFFIC, BECAUSE IT LOCKS AND THAT TIME I COULD BARELY MAKE IT TURN SLIGHTLY DUE TO THE STIFFNESS. AFTER THAT, THE CAR'S ENGINE WONT START BUT LIGHTS AND RADIO WORK. AFTER CONSTANTLY TURNING IT IN AND OFF ENGINE FINALLY STARTS UP AFTER APPROXIMATELY AN HOUR, BUT WHEN PLACED ON DRIVE ONLY MOVES VERY SLOW EVEN WHEN STEPPING ON GAS IT WILL MOVE AT ABOUT 1 MPH. I TURN IT OFF AND ON SEVERAL TIME AND THEN WHEN I FINALLY STEP ON THE GAS IT JERKS ME FORWARD FINALLY WHEN ON DRIVE....",
