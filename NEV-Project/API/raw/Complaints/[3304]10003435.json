        "summary": "STEERING WANDER ON 2001 2500 SERIES DODGE QUADCAB PICKUP. DUE MOSTLY TO FAULTY TRACK BAR.AND FRONT END ALIGNMENT SPECS ARE TO WIDE A RANGE AND IT CAN BE IN SPEC BUT STILL WANDER ALL OVER ROAD. YOU CAN DRIVE DOWN THE ROAD AND FOR NO REASON AT ALL THE TRUCK WANDERS INTO THE OTHER LANE. YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY COUNTER STEER BACK AND FORTH TO KEEP TRUCK ON THE ROAD. IT IS DANGEROUS NUMEROUS TIMES IVE ENDED UP IN DIFFERENT LANES AND OFF ONTO THE BURM OF TH ROAD. THE DEALER FORRER DODGE TOLD ME THAT THEIR REPLACING TRACK BARS ALL THE TIME AND HAVE EVEN REPLACED TRACK BARS ON TRUCKS THAT THEY HAD JUST RECEIVED IN FROM FACTORY.    THEIRS EVEN A CUSTOM COMPANY THAT MAKES A CUSTOM TRACK BAR BECAUSE THE DODGE ONE IS DEFECTIVE.AND THEIRS OTHER COMPANIES THAT REBUILD THE DODGE ONES TO BE STRONGER SO YOU CAN ELIMINATE THE WANDER. YOU KNOW THEIRS A PROBLEM WHEN THEIRS COMPANIES THAT MAKE STRONGER TRACK BARS AND THATS THE ONLY THING THEY MAKE.      PLEASE RECALL IT IS A BIG PROBLEM NOT ONLY ON THE 2001 BUT MANY OTHER YEARS TOO!    THEIRS EVEN A COUPLE WEB SITES LIKE WWW.DODGETRUCKSTEERINGPROBLEMS.COM     AND WWW.DODGESUCKS.COM AND WWW.DODGERAM.ORG",
