        "summary": "I OWN A 99 FORD RANGER THAT HAS A PROBLEM OF EXCESSIVE OUTERWEAR ON THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE. I'VE REPLACED THE TIRE TWICE AND TRIED TO HAVE THE VEHICLE ALIGNED BY BIG O TIRE IN VALLEJO, CA.  I WAS TOLD THAT EVERY OTHER FORD REQUIRES AN AFTER MARKET CAMBER KIT INSTALLATION IN ORDER TO PERFORM A FRONT-END ALIGNMENT.  I VISITED WILSON-CORNELIUS FORD IN VALLEJO, WHO CONFIRMED THAT IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM.  I CALLED FORD'S CUSTOMER SERVICE WHO WAS NO HELP, BECAUSE THE THREE YEAR MANUFACTURER WARRANTEE HAS EXPIRED.  ADDITIONAL, FORD REFUSES TO LOOK AT THE VEHICLE AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE.  I CONTENT THAT THIS IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT AND SHOULD BE REPAIRED AT FORD'S EXPENSE.  ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, I WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE A CAMBER KIT (PART # FMC F5TZ3B236A), WHICH ARE MERELY TWO IDENTICAL SPECIALLY DESIGNED BOLTS THAT COST $41.98/EACH.  THIS JUST DOES NOT SEEM RIGHT, NOR SHOULD ONE EXPECT TO INCUR COSTS TO MAKE A VEHICLE ADHERE TO A MANUFACTURER SPECIFICATION.  PLEASE HELP.  THANK YOU.",
