THE NEXT DAY NOVEMBER 10, 2018 AT 12:15 PM  WHILE DRIVING ON HWY 485 IN CHARLOTTE NC AND BEFORE I COULD TAKE IT TO THE DEALER FOR A CHECK; THE CLUTCH BRAKE EXPLODED LIKE A GRENADE, SENDING SCHRAPNAL THROUGH THE TRANSMISSION.  WE WERE LUCKY IT DIDN'T COME THROUGH THE CAB OR MY FAMILY WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.  THE TRAFFIC WAS VERY HEAVY DUE TO THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND, WE WERE ALSO LUCKY THAT WE DIDN'T GET INTO AN ACCIDENT.  I HAVE DRIVEN STANDARD TRANSMISSIONS ALL MY LIFE AND THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED.  TO SAY THE VERY LEAST I AM UPSET THIS VEHICLE SHOULD BE UNDER WARRANTEE DUE TO THE LOW MILEAGE AND SINCE I BOUGHT IT ON JAN 29, 2016,  IT IS UNDER 3 YEARS.  HOWEVER, I AM LOOKING AT A $3500 BILL TO REPAIR OR REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION.  THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE, THE CLUTCH BRAKE SHOULD NEVER EXPLODE LIKE THAT.  CHRYSLER IS SELLING WEAK MANUFACTURED PARTS TO THE PUBLIC.  THIS SHOULD BE RECALLED AND CHECKED OR REPLACED WITH A BETTER CLUTCH BRAKE BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED.",
