I HAD TO GO OUT AND FOUND OUT THE TIRES HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO TRACTION ON SNOW.  THESE TIRES ARE DANGEROUS FOR WINTER CONDITIONS.  I LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE SEVERAL TIMES.  ON THE WAY HOME, I WAS GOING APPROXIMATELY 15MPH WHEN ALL FOUR TIRES LOSS TRACTION DUE TO A 15 TO 20 MPH WIND AND ENDED UP IN A DITCH.  THE NEXT DAY I REPLACED THE TIRES WITH KELLY EXPLORER TIRES AND HAD NO TROUBLE NEGOTIATING THE SNOW.  THESE TIRES NEED TO BE PULLED FROM THE MARKET OR A WARNING GIVEN TO CONSUMERS.  THEY ALSO LOSE TRACTION ON WET ROADS EASILY. AS STATED, THEY ARE ADVERTISED AS  \" TIRES DELIVER ALL-SEASON TRACTION \". *TR",
