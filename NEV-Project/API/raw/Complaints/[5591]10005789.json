VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA HAS INFORMED ME THAT RATHER THAN REPLACE ALL 4 COILS, I MUST WAIT UNTIL EACH COIL BURNS OUT BEFORE THEY WILL REPLACE IT. I HAVE A LETTER FROM THEM AS WELL STATING THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT CAN NOT DO ANYTHING MORE ABOUT IT DUE TO A LACK OF COILS IN STOCK. I GUESS THE LETTER IS A WAY TO SHUT THE CUSTOMERS UP. APPARENTLY THIS IS HAPPENING TO OVER 500,000 PEOPLE LAST I HEARD. I WANT THIS COMPLAINT LOGGED AND A PERSONAL NOTE ADDED AND DIRECTED TO VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA (IF POSSIBLE), \"I WILL NOT RENEW MY LEASE ON THIS LEMON AND I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER VOLKSWAGEN AGAIN.\" THE COIL ISSUE IS JUST ONE OF THE ISSUES I'M HAVING WITH THIS VEHICLE. THE DATE BELOW IS THE LAST TIME I WENT IN FOR COIL REPLACEMENT AND GOT TO WORK LATE.",
