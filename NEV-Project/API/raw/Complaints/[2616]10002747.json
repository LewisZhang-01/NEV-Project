IT HAS INDIVIDUAL IGNITION COLIS FOR EACH CYLINDER.  THEY ARE FAILING AT AN ALARMING RATE.  SO FAR IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS TWO HAVE FAILED AND I EXPECT THE REMAINING ONES TO FAIL AT ANY TIME.  THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR THIS CAR.  FAILURE MEANS A TOW AND POSSIBLY BEING BEING STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.  VW IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM HOWEVER REFUSES TO REPLACE ANY COIL UNTIL FAILURE.  I BELIEVE THIS IS AN IRRESPONSIBLE POLICY.  THE CARS SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO RECALL AND REPLACEMENT.  THE ONLY REASONS THEY ARE NOT DOING THIS THAT I CAN IMAGINE ARE THAT EITHER THE STRAIN ON THEIR LOGISTICS IS TOO GREAT OR THEY HAVE NOT SOLVED THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM AND ARE REPLACING THE COILS WITH COMPONENTS THAT WILL ALSO FAIL IN A SHORT TIME.",
