I SPOKE TO A FORD SERVICE ADVISOR AND WAS TOLD IT WOULD COST ME OVER $600.00 TO REPAIR AND THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ONLY FOR CERTAIN STATES. THIS DOES NOT SEEM FAIR TO OTHER FORD OWNERS TO HAVE TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT FORD HAS A DEFAULT ON AND SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH IN A LOT OF THESE VEHICLES. I CAN NOT AFFORD THIS REPAIR AND I'M SURE MOST PEOPLE CAN NOT AFFORD. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS.  *TR  *JS",
