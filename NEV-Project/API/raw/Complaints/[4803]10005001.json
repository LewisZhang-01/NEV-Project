SIMPLE INTERNET RESEARCH (INCLUDING THIS WEBISTE) HAS SHOWN A PATTERN OF FAILURE FOR THESE PARTS ON THIS VEHICLE.  GM CUSTOMER SERVICE ACKNOWLDGED PROBLEM BUT WOULD NOT PAY ANY OF THE $1,200 REPAIR BILL SINCE THE VEHICLE HAS 80,000 MILES ON IT.  THIS IS A HUGE OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSE FOR A PART WITH A HISTORY OF PROBLEMS.  I PERSONALLY KNOW TWO OTHER 1998 VENTURE OWNERS WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME REPAIR.",
