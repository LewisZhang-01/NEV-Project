LIST OF REPAIRS: TIMING BELT, HEAD LIGHTS, STEERING, CAMSHAFT, OIL LEAK, STRUTS, BRAKES AND THIS IS WHAT I CAN RECALL MOSTLY.THIS VEHICLE HAS HAD MULTIPLE SERVICES ESPECIALLY FOR SERVICE STABILITY TRACK THAT NEVER GETS REPAIRED, THEY CAN'T FIND THE PROBLEM. ALSO SERVICE AIR BAG KEEPS COMING ON BUT DEALERSHIP CANNOT DO ANYTHING WHILE THE LIGHT IS NOT ON. VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THIS VEHICLE. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED SO MANY REPAIRS AND SERVICES WITH ANY OTHER VEHICLE AS I HAVE THE ACADIA. I OWNED A GALANT CAR BEFORE THE ACADIA FOR 5 YEARS AND ONLY HAD TO DO ONE REPAIR IN THOSE 5 YEARS I OWNED IT. I REGRET PURCHASING THIS VEHICLE! I AM A SINGLE MOTHER OF TWO AND I NEED A DEPENDABLE VEHICLE NOT ONE THAT IS MALFUNCTIONED!   *TR",
