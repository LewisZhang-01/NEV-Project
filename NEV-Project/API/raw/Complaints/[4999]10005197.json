I BORUGHT IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP ON 2/3 AND THEY STATED IT WAS A COIL. THEY REFUSED TO REPLACE ALL 4 COILS, ONLY THE FAULTY ONE,  AND I WAS TOLD THAT ONLY IF THIS POWER FAILURE OCCURS AGAIN AND IT IS DUE TO ANOTHER COIL...THEN THEY WOULD REPLACE ALL FOUR. I AM QUESTIONING THE RELIABILITY OF MY CAR, SINCE IT APPEARS THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN WIDE SPREAD THROGHOUT THE US. I FEEL VERY UNSAFE IN MY YEAR AND HALF OLD BEETLE THAT WAS BOUGHT BECAUSE OF THE HIGH RELIABILITY RATING AT THE TIME.",
