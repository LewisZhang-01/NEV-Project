        "summary": "I WAS RECENTLY NOTIFIED THAT MY 2002 NISSAN ALTIMA IS IN NEED OF A NEW ENGINE.  IT HAS 72K MILES ON IT.  THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER WAS ALREADY REPLACED BY THE DEALERSHIP.  IT HAS HAD AN OIL CONSUMPTION PROBLEM THAT HAS OF LATE BECOME QUITE A CAUSE FOR CONCERN.  (I NOW CHECK MY OIL EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS.)  I FEAR THAT IF I KEEP DRIVING IT, I WILL RUIN ANOTHER CATALYTIC CONVERTER.  UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE NO OTHER TRANSPORTATION AND I CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE SELL IT TO ANOTHER PARTY.  NOR CAN I AFFORD THE REPLACE THE ENGINE.    THIS WAS THE FIRST NEW CAR THAT I EVER BOUGHT OFF THE LOT.  I HAVE KEPT EXCELLENT SERVICE RECORDS AND HAVE MAINTAINED THE VEHICLE VERY WELL AND HAVE HAD ALL OF THE RECOMMENDED RECALLS DONE.  I FEEL THAT I HAVE BEEN DUPED.  THE DEALERSHIP ACTS AS IF I HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG BUT I HAVE FOUND THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS EXPERIENCED THIS VERY SAME PROBLEM.     PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR LIST OF DISSATISFIED CUSTOMERS!   I WOULD WELCOME YOUR INPUT AS WHAT MY NEXT COURSE OF ACTION MIGHT BE IN THE PURSUIT OF A JUST RESOLUTION.  I WOULD ALSO BE INTERESTED HEARING ABOUT ANY CLASS ACTION LAW SUITS THAT MAY EXIST AS A RESULT OF NISSAN'S NEGLIGENCE IN THIS MATTER.  *NM",
