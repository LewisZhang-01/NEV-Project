MFG CLAIMING NEEDING ENGINE REPLACEMENT DUE TO SLUDGE BUILD-UP FROM POOR MAINTENANCE, HOWEVER, MAINTENANCE HAS BEEN KEPT BEYOND RECOMMENDATION AND IS DOCUMENTED.  I HAVE HAD THIS VEHICLE IN THE SHOP SINCE PURCHASED USED 3 YEARS AGO, ALL WITH OIL ISSUES AND ONLY NOW IS THE ISSUE W/ SLUDGE MENTIONED.  AFTER CHECKING COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET I HAVE FOUND THOUSANDS OF OTHER COMPLAINTS SIMILAR TO THIS ONE WHERE PEOPLE WERE TOLD THEY NEED AN ENGINE REPLACEMENT DUE TO SLUDGE.  MULTIPLE CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS SEEM TO BE PENDING ON THIS AS WELL.  I HAVE TALKED WITH MANY MECHANICS WHO ADVISE THAT MOST DODGE RAM TRUCKS THEY SEE HAVE THIS EXACT SAME PROBLEM BECAUSE THE ENGINE'S COMPRESSION IS SET TO HIGH AND IT CAUSES THE OIL TO SLUDGE UP.  MAINTENANCE HAS BEEN KEPT, OIL CHANGES EVERY 1500 MILES.  LESS THAN 10K MILES PUT ON THE VEHICLE SINCE PURCHASED WITH EXTENDED WARRANTY (WHICH WILL NOT COVER THIS.) .  *NLM",
