WHEN IT FLICKERS, AN INDICATOR WARNING LIGHT ACTIVATES ON THE DASHBOARD. THIS SEEMS TO BE A WIRING PROBLEM. BOTH HEADLIGHTS WERE CHANGED AND BRAND NEW WHEN THE CAR WAS PURCHASED. TWO YEARS LATER, THIS FLICKERING BEGAN. THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE FLICKERING OF THE HEADLIGHT IS TO COMPLETELY TURN OFF THE HEADLIGHTS FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN TURN THEM BACK ON. EVERYTHING IS FINE AFTER THAT. PLEASE RECALL THIS ISSUE. I HAVE READ MANY POSTS ONLINE WITH OTHER AUDI A4 OWNERS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR VEHICLES.",
