ON MAY 05, 2017 WHILE DRIVING FROM WALMART TO MY COLLEGE CAMPUS, I HEARD LOUD KNOCKING SOUND COMING FROM THE ENGINE. I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER THE SIDE AND HAD THE CAR TOWED TO MY APARTMENT BUILDING. THE FOLLOWING FRIDAY ON MAY 12, 2017, I HAD THE CAR TOWED FROM DALLAS TO OUR MECHANIC SHOP IN FORT WORTH. THE MECHANIC CALLED AND TOLD ME THAT THE ENGINE HAS CEASED. THE COST TO REPLACE THE ENGINE INCLUDING THE LABOR IS $3300. I WAS HAVING THE OIL CHANGED EVERY 3000 MILES AND I WAS ALSO ADDING OIL EVERY 2 WEEKS. THIS EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION HAS RESULTED IN A TOTAL ENGINE LOSS.",
