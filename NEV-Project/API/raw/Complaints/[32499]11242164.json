IT DOES NOT MATTER IF YOU'RE MOVING ON THE FREEWAY OR PARKED, IT IS VERY INTERMITTENT AND ONLY HAPPENED THREE TIMES IN THE LAST 6 TO 8 WEEKS. TWO DIFFERENT MECHANICS SAID ERROR IT'S CODE P1682 IS THE FAULT BUT IT WILL NOT DUPLICATE THE SYMPTOMS.  I CONTACTED CHEVY CORPORATE AND THEY KNOWLEDGE OTHER VEHICLES THIS YEAR HAVE A RECALL BUT CLAIM MICE VIN NUMBER IS NOT AFFECTED AND WILL DO NOTHING. HEY FUEL VEHICLE IS IN SAFE AND DO NOT WANT MY FAMILY IN IT UNTIL I AM CERTAIN IT WILL NOT SUDDENLY SHUT OFF WHILE THEY ARE IN MOTION.",
