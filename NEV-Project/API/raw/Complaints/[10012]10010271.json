IT WAS TOWED TO A SHOP WHERE THEY WERE ADVISED THE PART WAS ON A NATIONAL BACK ORDER.  IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE 2 WEEKS, IF NOT LONGER TO GET THE PART IN.  BECAUSE MY TRUCK WAS NOT AT A NISSAN DEALERSHIP, NISSAN CHARGED THE AUTO SHOP AN EXTRA 10% TO GET THE PART AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  I CONTACTED NISSAN CORPORATE, AND THEY SAID IT WOULD TAKE 3 TO 4 DAYS FOR THEM TO AUTHORIZE THE REIMBURSEMENT OF A RENTAL CAR. *JB",
