THIS WAS DONE 06/19/02 ALTHOUGH NO REDUNDANT CHECK VALVES WERE INSTALLED.  THE RECALL REPAIR HAS FAILED AND FUEL IS BACKWASHING FROM THE AFT TANK TO THE MIDSHIP TANK, CAUSING IT TO OVERFLOW.  THE LOCAL FORD DEALER(COASTAL FORD) STATES IT IS NO LONGER RESPONSIBLE, AND I CANNOT GET FORD MOTOR COMPANY TO CONTACT ME.  THIS IS DANGEROUS AND THIS HAS HAPPENED SUBSEQUENTLY TO OTHERS. PLEASE HELP!",
