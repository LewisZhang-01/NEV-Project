        "summary": "FOLLOW UP TO PREVIOUS COMPLAINT.  HONDA AMERICA SAYS ROTTEN EGG SMELL FROM 2003 ACCORD IS HYDROGEN SULFIDE.  HONDA IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP. READ ME A PREPARED STATEMENT THAT THE 2003 ACCORDS HAVE A PROBLEM IN RELEASING HYDROGEN SULFIDE DUE TO DESIGN, IT IS NOT THE GASOLINE.  NO TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS HAS BEEN RELEASED.  THERE IS NO FIX.  HONDA CLAIMS THE PROBLEM SHOULD GO AWAY OR DISSIPATE SOMETIME BETWEEN 3000-5000 MILES.  I HAVE 3950 MILES AND THE SMELL IS AWFUL.  HONDA WILL DO NOTHING TO HELP.  ACCORDING TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL (CDC), HYDROGEN SULFIDE IS A BROAD-SPECTRUM POISON!    BREATHING HIGH LEVELS OF HYDROGEN SULFIDE CAN CAUSE DEATH WITHIN JUST A FEW BREATHS! EXPOSURE TO LOWER CONCENTRATIONS CAN RESULT IN EYE IRRITATION, A SORE THROAT, COUGH, SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND FLUID IN THE LUNGS.  I HAVE BEEN SHOWING SOME OF THESE SYMPTOMS.  WHY HAS NHTSA DONE NOTHING ON THIS ISSUE?  THE PROBLEM MUST BE WIDE-SPREAD AS HONDA HAS A PREPARED STATEMENT FOR ITS REPS TO READ OVER THE PHONE.  I WILL ATTEMPT A LEMON LAW CLAIM AND/OR CIVIL ACTION FOR DAMAGES DUE TO INJURIES FROM EXPOSURE TO THE HYDROGEN SULFIDE.  (INCIDENT DATE DOES NOT APPLY AS THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN CONSTANT). *JB",
