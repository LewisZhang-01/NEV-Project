I CALLED GMC CUSTOMER SERVICE TO GET THE PROBLEM DOCUMENTED AN TO SEE WHAT THEY THINK OF IT.  THEY INFORMED ME TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND GIVE MY SERVICE REQUEST NUMBER (1-64044981) AND HAVE THEM DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. THE DEALERSHIP HAD ME PICK THE VEHICLE UP AND THEY TOLD ME THE SHOP FOREMAN LISTENED TO MY NOISE ALONG WITH TWO OTHER VEHICLES OF THE SAME MAKE, MODEL, AND YEAR AND ALL MADE THE SAME NOISE.  I CALLED GMC BACK TO LET THEM KNOW THE PROBLEM WAS NOT DIAGNOSED AND GOT THE VOICEMAIL BOX OF THE REPRESENITIVE SO I LEFT A MESSAGE TO PLEASE CALL ME BACK. I HAVE NOT RECIEVED A CALL BACK SO I CALLED AND TALKED TO TWO OTHER REPRESENITIVES AND THEY WILL NOT HELP ME THEY JUST LEFT MESSAGES FOR THE ORIGINAL REPRESENATIVE THAT I TALKED TO. I GUESS THAT GMC DOES NOT WANT  TO TALK TO ME ABOUT MY COMPLAINT.",
