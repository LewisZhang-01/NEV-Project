WHEN MY VEHICLE HIT 800 MILES THE LOCKS STARTED LOCKING AND UNLOCKING ALL THE TIME, WHETHER THE KEY WAS IN THE IGNITION OR NOT.  IT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO THE TOPOR DODGE 2 TIMES AND THE PROBLEM WAS UNABLE TO BE FIXED.  IT IS NOW BACK IN FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.  ONLY NOW THEY JUST KEEP UNLOCKING ALL THE TIME.  I HAVE TO LEAVE IT AT TOPOR TIL THE PROBLEM IS FIXED BECAUSE THE DOORS WON'T STAY LOCKED AND IS A SAFETY HAZARD.  I WORK IN SPRINGFIELD MASSACHUSETTS AND IT IS UNSAFE TO TAKE MY OWN DURANGO TO WORK.  IT HAS BEEN AT THE DEALERSHIP SINCE JUNE 3,2003 AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG I WILL BE WITHOUT MY BRAND NEW DURANGO.  THIS IS A SAFETY DEFECT THAT I KNOW LONGER WANT TO DEAL WITH.  MY DURANGO NOW HAS 4200 MILES ON IT AND THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS.*AK",
