I WAS TOLD THE ROTORS HAD TO BE TURNED WHEN I BROUGHT IT IN THE FIRST TIME (19,000 MILES).  I JUST BROUGHT THE CAR BACK IN TODAY FOR THE SAME PROBLEM AND WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT CHRYSLER CAME OUT WITH A SERVICE BULLETIN ON THE ROTORS, BUT WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED AT MY EXPENSE.  THIS IS BS.  I'M A MECHANIC IN THE AIR FORCE AND THIS IS A BIG TIME SAFETY ISSUE.  IF LEFT UNCORRECTED THIS MAY EVENTUALLY CAUSE BREAK FAILURE. TS",
