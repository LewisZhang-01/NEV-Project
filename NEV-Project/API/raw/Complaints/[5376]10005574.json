I BELIEVE THE AD IS CRIMINALLY IRRESPONSIBLE, GIVEN THE HIGH COST IN LIVES, INJURIES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE THAT OCCURS EVERY YEAR WHEN VEHICLES DRIVEN AT HIGH SPEED IN FOG COLLIDE WITH OTHER VEHICLES.  I HAVE REQUESTED CADILLAC TO IMMEDATELY WITHDRAW THIS AD AND IN THE FUTURE MAKE SOME MINIMAL EFFORT TO APPEAL TO RESPONSIBLE DRIVING BEHAVIOR.  WHAT ACTION CAN I EXPECT YOUR AGENCY TO TAKE?
