FUEL INTEGRITY -  ERRATIC FUEL READING - SHOWS 1/4 TANK - WHEN IN REALITY THERE IS NO GAS.  I HAVE RAN OUT OF GAS APPROXIMATELY 7 TIMES - SEVERAL TIMES LATE AT NIGHT.  NO CRUISE CONTROL - GM WOULD NOT REPAIR.  BRAKES PADS/ROTORS - HAVE REPLACED 3 TIMES.  MY LOCAL DEALER ROTOLO CHEVROLET AND GM CUSTOMER SERVICE WOULD DO NOTHING.   IT WAS EXPENSIVE.  PREMATURE TIRE WEAR - TWO SETS OF TIRES.  CARS RUNS HOT - WOULD NEVER GO ON A TRIP - BECAUSE IT WOULD GET TOO NEAR OVERHEATING.  I WAS AFRAID OF GETTING STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT.  ENGINE TICKING NOISE - LOCAL DEALER SAID THIS WAS NORMAL.   NOW, I FIND NONE OF THESE THINGS WERE NORMAL AND MANY, MANY MORE CAR OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME TYPE OF PROBLEMS.  ALSO, I HAD A BATTERY THAT EXPLODED WHILE CAR WAS UNDER WARRANTY.  IT WAS MY PROBLEM.  DEALERSHIP WOULD NOT REPLACE BATTERY.  I FINALLY HAD ENOUGH AND TURNED THIS AUTOMOBILE BACK TO GMAC.  IS IT GOING TO TAKE PEOPLE GETTING KILLED TO MAKE GM RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ISSUES WITH THE 2000 MALIBU.  ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS WERE REPORTED TO THE DEALER, BUT SINCE NOTHING COULD BE DUPLICATED, EVEN THOUGH GM WAS AWARE OF THESE ISSUES, THEY WOULD DO NOTHING.  AFTER THE CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, THE DEALERSHIP WAS MORE THAN WILLING TO CORRECT THESE ISSUES.  THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS THE DECEPTION.....GM IS AWARE OF THESE ISSUES AND HAVE BEEN FOR SOME TIME.  SOMEONE NEEDS TO HOLD THEN ACCOUNTABLE.  *JB",
