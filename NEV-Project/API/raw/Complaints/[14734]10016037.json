WHILE THE CONSUMER WAS DRIVING ABOUT 60 MPH THE SAFETY FEATURE ACTIVATED AND THE VEHICLE SPEED WAS REDUCED.  THE DRIVER WAS FORCED TO PULL OVER AND THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TOT HE DEALER.  I WAS LATER DETERMINED THAT A FAULTY ESP CONTROL MODULE SENT A FALSE WARNING TO THE SYSTEM THAT  MADE THE VEHICLE REDUCE SPEED.  THE CONSUMER FEELS THIS FEATURE WAS DESIGNED POORLY AND THAT IT SHOULD BE DESIGNED SO IT COULD BE MANUALLY OVERRIDDEN (MERCEDES BENZ S430 2002).    *MR   *SCC   *NLM",
