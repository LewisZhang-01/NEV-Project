THE MECHANIC NOTIFIED ME THAT THE HEADGASKET WAS LEAKING AT THE 4TH CYLANDER AND ADVISED ME TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER.  THE DEALER CHARGED ME $300.00 AND STATED IN WRITING THAT NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE HEAD GASKET.  ON JANUARY 19, MY CAR STOPPED RUNNING AND I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO THE DEALER.  THE NEXT DAY I WAS NOTIFIED THAT IT WAS MY HEADGASKET AND THEY OVERLOOKED THE LEAK AT THE EXACT LOCATION I TOLD THEM BASED ON MY MECHANICS ADVISE.  NOW THEY WANT AN ADDITIONAL $1200.00 TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  MY MECHANIC ADVISED ME THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR THIS VEHICLE AND TO FILE A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE DEALER.  MY CONCERN IS NOW THE ENGINE MAY HAVE BEEN DAMAGED BY THE LACK OF PROPER ATTENTION BY THE DEALER.",
