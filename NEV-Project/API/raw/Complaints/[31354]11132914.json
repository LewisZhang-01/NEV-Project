THIS OCCURRED SEVERAL TIMES WHILE I WAS BEHIND THE VEHICLE.  ON SOME OCCASIONS MY CHILD(REN) WAS WITH ME AND WAS ALMOST HIT AS WELL.  SINCE I AM TALLER I WAS HIT AND WAS ABLE TO SAVE MY CHILD FROM INJURY.  I WAS HIT SEVERAL TIMES ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS EITHER I THE HEAD OR IN THE BACK, DEPENDING ON MY POSITION AT THE TIME.  I ENSURED THAT I DID NOT HAVE THE KEY FOB IN MY POCKET TO ACCIDENTLY ACTIVATE THE CLOSURE, AND I ENSURE THAT I DID NOT ACCIDENTLY ACTIVATE THE CLOSURE SENSOR UNDERNEATH THE REAR BUMPER AREA.  UPON INVESTIGATION THE DEALER DETERMINE THE CAUSE TO BE A LIFT GATE MODULE DEFECT, AS WELL AS SENSOR AND LIFT GATE CALIBRATION.",
