COULD HAVE CAUSED A FATALITY IN ANOTHER VEHICLE IF IT OCCURED AT HIGH SPEED.  A TIRE SHOP WAS THE LAST TO REPLACE THE SPARE. THEY SAY THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE. I HAVE ALWAYS TIGHTENED IT FULLY IN THE PAST. I ASSUME THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN A BIT LOOSE AND WORE THROUGH THE CABLE OVER TIME AS IT RUBBED ON THE WHEEL.",
