IT OCCURED AT A SPEED OF 30 MPH FORCING ME TO TAKE EVASIVE DRIVING ACTION.  UPON FURTHER RESEARCH, I FOUND OUT THAT THIS FAILURE IS OCCURING ON A VERY LARGE SCALE WITH DOZENS AND DOZENS OF 1.8T ENGINES (BOTH VW AND AUDI) HAVING THIS PROBLEM.  VW/AUDI HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL FOR THESE PARTS AND IS ONLY REPLACING THE FAILED PART.  THERE ARE COIL PACKS IN EACH 1.8T.  VW/AUDI IS NOT ACTING ON THIS PROBLEM LEAVING THOUSANDS OF 1.8T OWNERS WITH DEFECTIVE PARTS IN THEIR CARS.  WHEN A COIL PACK FAILS IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION.",
