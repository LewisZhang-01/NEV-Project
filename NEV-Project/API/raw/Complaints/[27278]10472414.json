THE OCS MISS CLASSIFIES THE ADULT IN THE FRONT SEAT AND THE AIR BAG LIGHT STAYS ON WHICH TURNS THE FRONT AND THE SIDE AIR BAG OFF. KIA HAS A RECALL CAMPAIGN FOR CERTAIN SORENTOS TO BE REPROGRAMMED. HOWEVER WHEN I TOOK MY CAR TO THE KIA DEALER I WAS TOLD THAT MY VIN NUMBER WAS NOT IN THE RECALL EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. THEY TOLD ME THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPROGRAMMING MY SELF. THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME BECAUSE MY SORENTO WAS MANUFACTURED WITHIN THE RECALL DATES AND HAS THE SAME PROBLEM. I FEEL THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN AND SHOULD ME PAID FOR MY KIA MOTORS.  *TR",
