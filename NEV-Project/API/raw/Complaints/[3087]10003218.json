ON 12/16/02, ANOTHER COIL PACK FAILED AND I DIDN'T GET THE CAR BACK UNTIL 12/30/02.  ON 1/8/03, A THIRD COIL PACK FAILED, AND I DIDN'T GET THE CAR BACK UNTIL 1/20/03.  IN EACH CASE, THE CAR DROPPED DEAD WITHIN 2 MILES OF A DEALERSHIP.  AT THIS POINT, I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE CAR BEYOND THE 5 MILES IT TAKES ME TO GET TO WORK.  I'VE SPOKEN WITH VW NORTH AMERICA ABOUT REPLACING THE FOURTH (AND FINAL) COIL PACK, BUT THEY ARE UNWILLING TO DO SO UNTIL IT, TOO, FAILS.  THE CAR IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY, BUT THAT WILL EXPIRE IN ANOTHER 1000 MILES.",
