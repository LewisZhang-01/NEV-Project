THE BEEPING NOISE INDICATING THE DOOR IS OPENED CONTINUES TO MAKE NOISE. THE DOORS NO LONGER LOCK. THIS CONDITION CONTINUED EVEN WHEN THE CAR IS RUNNING. THE DEALER SAID TO JUST REMOVE THE INTERIOR BULBS OR JUST PULL THE FUSE. WHEN THE DEALER PULLED THE  FUSED THE BRAKE LIGHTS NO LONGER WORKED AND THE CAR COULD NO LONGER GO OUT OF PARK BUT THE INTERIOR  LIGHTS WENT OUT. THE DEALER SAID I MUST START THE CAR WITH GEAR SHIFT  HALF WAY BETWEEN PARK AND NEUTRAL.  THE DEALER SAID THIS IS A VERY UNIQUE PROBLEM AND IS CAUSED BY SOMETHING THAT I DID. I STATED THAT'S  ABSURD. THE FORD DEALER MECHANIC THEN SAID IT MUST BE ONE OF SENSORS PROBABLY THE DRIVERS DOOR.  NOW  I SEE THERE ARE OTHERS THAT HAVE  THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS PROBLEM.   *JB",
