        "summary": "I HAVE A ONE-YEAR-OLD HONDA S2000.  I BROUGHT MY CAR TO A DEALER FOR A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND FACTORY RECALL OF SPARK PLUGS.  THE REPLACEMENT WAS PERFORMED AND I RECEIVED MY CAR BACK.  THE NEXT DAY THE LIGHT WAS BACK ON.  I RETURNED TO THE DEALER.  I WAS INFORMED THERE NOW WAS 80% LOSS OF COMPRESSION IN ONE OF THE CYLINDERS.  I WAS INFORMED THAT I CREATED THIS PROBLEM AND THE WARRANTY WILL NOT COVER THE REPAIR.  I ASKED THE COST AND WAS TOLD I DON'T KNOW.  PROBABLY $10,000.00 DOLLARS.  I ASKED HOW THAT WAS DETERMINED AND WAS TOLD WE DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT.  I COMPLAINED AND WAS INFORMED THAT A DISTRICT SERVICE MANAGER DETERMINED OVER THE PHONE THAT I CAUSED THE PROBLEM.  I ASKED IF A RENTAL WOULD BE PROVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH MY EXTENDED WARRANTY.  I WAS TOLD NO THIS IS YOUR FAULT.  I CONTACTED AMERICAN HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE (800) 999-1009.  I SPOKE WITH MIKE BOGAN AT EXT 118142.  HE INFORMED ME, HE WOULD GET THE ANSWERS.  I WAITED TWO DAYS WITH NO RESPONSE.  I GOT A VOICE MAIL SAYING THAT THE DEALER DETERMINED IT WAS MY FAULT AND HONDA WOULD NOT COVER THE REPAIR OR RENTAL.    I COMPLAINED THEN ABOUT THE LANGUAGE USED BY TECH # 702 AT CLINTON HONDA.  HE INFORMED ME THAT HE DOES NOT LIKE DOCTORS AND SINCE HIS WIFE LOST  A LAWSUIT BY A DOCTOR THAT HE WOULDN'T AUTHORIZE ANY REPAIRS FOR MY CAR SINCE I AM A DOCTOR.   *JB",
