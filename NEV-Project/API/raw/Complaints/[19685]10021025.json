MEANWHILE, WENT TO NISSAN WEBSITE AND FOUND THE EXACT CAUSE. I THEN CALLED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND WAS INFORMED MY CAR SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECALLED. I THEN CALLED DEALER'S SVC MGR, WHO SAID HE WASN'T SURE. I TOLD HIM I SPOKE WITH THEIR CONSUMER DEPT AND THEY CONFIRMED THE CAR HAD A RECALL PROBLEM.  HE CALLED BACK 2 HRS LATER AND SAID MY CAR WAS FIXED.  I ASKED ABOUT THE $65 TOWING REFUND. HE SAID TO CALL NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS. ALL OWNERS OF 2001 NISSAN SHOULD IMMEDIATELY BE NOTIFIED OF THIS DANGER.   *NLM",
