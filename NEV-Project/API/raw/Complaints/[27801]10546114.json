I HAD THEM REPLACED WITH THE CRANKCASE POSITION SENSOR.  AFTER REPLACEMENT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN AND REMAINS.  I HAD THE VEHICLE CHECKED AGAIN AND WAS TOLD THAT THE \"TIMING CHAIN WAS STRETCHED AND WOULD NEED REPLACEMENT.  MY MECHANIC SUGGESTED THAT I GET RID OF THE CAR BECAUSE OF THE COST OF REPAIR.  THIS OCCURRED JUST AFTER MY POWERTRAIN WARRANTY WAS UP.  IS THERE ANY RECOURSE WITH GENERAL MOTORS REGARDING THE REPAIR COSTS OF MY VEHICLE.  IT APPEARS TO ME THAT GM HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FOR SOMETIME EVEN THOUGH MY VEHICLE DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS UNTIL LAST MONTH.  THANK YOU FOR ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GIVE ME.
