THE RECALL RELATES TO FAULTY WIPER MOTOR CIRCUIT BOARDS THAT LEAD TO INTERMITTENT OPERATION OF WIPER BLADES.  I OWN A 1998 CHEVY S-10 AND HAVE EXPERIENCED NUMEROUS FAILURES OF THE WIPER BLADES DURING RAIN STORMS.  THE MOST SEVERE INCIDENT HAPPENED DURING HEAVY RAINS ON JUNE 4, WHEN I LOST THE USE OF MY WIPERS FOR 20 MINUTES.  I HAVE DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM TO MECHANICS WHO INFORMED ME OF THE RECALL AND INDICATED THAT IT IS MOST LIKELY THE SAME PROBLEM AS THAT OF THE RECALL.  THE RECALL SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO MODEL YEAR 1998 AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  *JB",
