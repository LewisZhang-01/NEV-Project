AT THIS POINT THE PEDAL WAS VERY HARD. WHICH IF THE VACUUM BOOSTER FAILED IT SHOULD HAVE LEFT ME WITH HYDRAULIC MANUAL BRAKES, AND IT DID NOT. I HAD TO STOP THE TRUCK WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE AFTER ROLLING THROUGH A RED LIGHT AT ABOUT 30 TO 40 MPH. I REPLACED THE VACUUM BOOSTER AND IT FIXED THE PROBLEM. CHEVY CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT. WAS CALLED AND A CASE WAS OPENED #C06749958. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE LIKE IT FAILED, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A LOSS OF LIFE ISSUE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS OF BRAKE PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE AND AT THIS POINT NOTHING BEING DONE ABOUT IT. *TS  ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12-12-02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS***761073",
