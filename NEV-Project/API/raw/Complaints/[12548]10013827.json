        "summary": "ON, MARCH 21, 2003 I PURCHASED A NEW 2003 FORD F-150 XLT. WE WERE DRIVING BACK HOME FROM THE DEALERSHIP AT 65 MPH  WHEN WE STARTED DOWN A SMALL HILL, THE TRUCKS FRONT END STARTED SHAKING AND VIBRATING PRETTY BAD, AND DIDN'T STOP SHAKING AND VIBRATING UNTIL I CAME TO A STOP. I PULLED ONTO A SIDE STREET AND STOPPED. I LOOKED FOR A PROBLEM AND COULD SEE NOTHING WRONG. PUT THE TRUCK IN DRIVE AND CONTINUED MY WAY HOME, THE PROBLEM HAD NOW STOPPED.  ON APRIL 1, 2003 I WAS DRIVING ON THE EAST-WEST EXPRESSWAY IN ORLANDO, AT ABOUT 65 MPH WHEN I STARTED DOWN ANOTHER SMALL HILL, THE TRUCK STARTED SHAKING/VIBRATING VIOLENTLY, I PRESSED ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AND IT ONLY MADE IT WORSE. I HAD TO WRESTLE FOR CONTROL OF THE TRUCK UNTIL I GOT IT TO THE SHOULDER. AGAIN THE SHAKING/VIBRATING DIDN'T STOP UNTIL THE TRUCK CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP.. I'M VERY LUCKY THE ROAD WASN'T WET, I'D HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR SURE.  PUT THE TRUCK BACK IN DRIVE AND THE PROBLEM WAS GONE AGAIN. MY TRUCK IS NOW AT ROLLING HILLS FORD SERVICE DEPT. IN CLERMONT FLORIDA. DEALER JUST CALLED ME BACK SAYING THEY CANNOT DUPLICATE PROBLEM. WHICH MEANS THEY DIDN'T EVEN LOOK FOR THE PROBLEM. I REALLY DON'T WANT TO RISK SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH UNTIL FORD CAN FIND THE PROBLEM. PLEASE HELP.   *NLM",
