I GOT CURIOUS, TRIED STARTING THE CAR, IT STARTED BACK UP.  I THEN DROVE TO THE DEALERSHIP, THE TECHNICIAN SAID NO ERROR CODE AND THEREFORE NO PROBLEM WITH THE CAR.  TODAY (SUNDAY), MY CAR STALLED AGAIN, THIS TIME I WAS DRIVING 20 MPH, THE CAR STARTED BACK UP.  WHAT IS CAUSING THIS? I HAVE SMALL CHILDREN RIDING WITH ME! PLEASE GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THIS!    *NLM",
