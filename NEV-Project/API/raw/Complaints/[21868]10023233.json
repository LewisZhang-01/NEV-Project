I REPLACE IT EACH TIME, WHILE COMING TO WORK THIS MORNING, I HIT A BUMP IN THE ROAD, AND THEN HEARD AN AWFUL NOISE.  I PULLED OVER, OPENED THE HOOD TO SEE SPARKS FLYING EVERYWHERE.  I IMMEDIATELY SHUT THE TRUCK OFF TO INVESTIGATE AND FOUND THAT THE CABLE HAD COME OUT OF ITS PLACE YET AGAIN & FALLEN INTO THE FAN.  I WAS LUCKY I SHUT IT OFF WHEN I DID, THERE WAS ONLY A FEW \"THREADS\" OF COPPER HOLDING IT TOGETHER.  HAD IT CUT COMPLETELY IN TWO, THERE MOST LIKELY WOULD HAVE BEEN A FIRE.  *JB",
