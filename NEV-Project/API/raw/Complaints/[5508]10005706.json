        "summary": "AT 32,000 MILES LOUD GRATING NOISE FROM RIGHT BRAKE AREA AFTER BRAKING HARD OR BRAKING INTO RIGHT TURN. DEALERSHIP DETERMINED I NEEDED NEW BRAKES. REPLACED BRAKE PADS AND MACHINED ROTORS. THIS DIDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM. 2ND DIAGNOSIS WAS AN INTERNAL LEAK IN POWER STEERING SYSTEM. THIS APPEARED TO HAVE FIXED PROBLEM. A FEW DAYS LATER I NOTICED A KNOCKING NOISE WHEN BRAKING. INFORMED DEALERSHIP BUT THE NOISE STOPPED DUE TO COLD WEATHER. THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT BACK IF NOISE RESUMED. IT DID WHEN WEATHER GOT WARMER AND BRAKE PADS WERE ADJUSTED (35,000 MILES). RIGHT AWAY I NOTICED THE BRAKES DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT. CAR SLOWED DOWN WHEN BRAKES WERE APPLIED BUT I HAD TO REALLY PRESS THE PEDAL DOWN TO GET IT TO STOP. ABOUT 1 WEEK LATER I HEARD KNOCKING AGAIN WHEN BRAKES WERE APPLIED LIGHTLY. THERE WAS ALSO A CREEKING NOISE FROM THE BRAKE PEDAL AND A SIGNIFICANT PULL TO THE RIGHT. KNOCKING NOISE GOT WORSE, BECAME A THUMPING NOISE. TOOK BACK TO DEALERSHIP. HAD TO MAKE APPOINTMENT. (THEY DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO LISTEN TO THE NOISE!). THE DAY BEFORE MY APPOINTMENT NOISE GOT SO BAD I THOUGHT MY BRAKES WERE GOING TO FALL OFF. I TOOK IT TO AN INDEPENDANT MECHANIC AND HE DIAGNOSED THAT THE RIGHT ROTOR WAS WARPED (EXCESSIVE RUNOUT). TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP ARMED WITH A PRINTOUT OF DIAGNOSIS FROM MECHANIC. ROTOR MACHINED AGAIN (36,000 MILES). I ASKED THE SERVICE REP WHAT COULD CAUSE THE ROTOR TO WARP AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T KNOW, IT COULD BE HOW I WAS DRIVING THE CAR! WHILE IT WAS IN THE SHOP I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT BRAKE PROBLEMS ARE VERY COMMON IN THIS MODEL AND YEAR AND THAT THE DEALERSHIPS ARE QUITE AWARE OF THIS. BRAKES STILL DON'T STOP THE CAR PROPERLY AND ARE NOW MAKING A SLIGHT GRATING NOISE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE IS NO INVESTIGATION OR RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM. SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED, IF THEY HAVEN'T ALREADY. I'VE HEARD THE GOVERNMENT CAN FORCE A RECALL IF THERE ARE ENOUGH COMPLAINTS. WHY HASN'T THIS BEEN DONE? PLEASE ADVISE",
