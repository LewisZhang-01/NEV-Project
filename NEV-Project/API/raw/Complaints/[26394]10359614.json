CREEPS BACK DOWN INSTANTLY AND CANNOT SEE OUT OF WINDSHIELD EVEN WITH VISOR PUSHED ALL THE WAY TOWARDS WINDSHIELD.  OFFERS NO USE, AND WHEN TRYING TO USE IT OBSTRUCTS VIEW AND IS VERY DANGEROUS.  IF VISORS ARE REQUIRED, THEN THIS ONE IS A FAILURE.  HAVE NOTED OTHERS ON THE HONDA CRV OWNERS CLUB FORUM WITH SAME PROBLEM.  HAVE ASKED THAT THEY ALSO FILE WITH NHTSA.  TO BE CLEAR, WHEN STORED AWAY IN NORMAL POSITION IT STAYS IN PLACE, WHEN TRYING TO PULL IT DOWN AND PUSH TOWARDS WINDSHIELD WHEN SUN IS IN FACE, IT PUSHES TO WINDSHIELD THEN INSTANTLY FLOPS BACK DOWN TO POSITION WHERE IT OBSCURES THE VIEW OUT THE WINDSHIELD.  REPLACEMENTS WORK FINE FOR SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.  THEY HAVE WARRANTIED 3 TIMES, AND I HAVE HAD TO BUY TWICE AS IT WAS JUST OVER 1 YEAR BEFORE I TOOK IT IN.  I HAVE AND OLD PART THAT WAS REPLACED WHEN I HAD TO PURCHASE OUT OF WARRANTY.  THE KEPT THE OTHER PARTS, BUT HAVE NO EXPLANATION FOR FIX. *TR",
