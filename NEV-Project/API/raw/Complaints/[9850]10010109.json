MY POWER TRAIN DIFFERENTIAL PIN WENT THROUGH THE CASING RENDERING MY TRANSMISSION USELESS, IT HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE SHOP.  THE REPAIR BILL IS $2500 FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION.  THE TRANSMISSION REPAIR SHOP SAID THIS IS VERY COMMON ON THESE VANS.  A SEARCH ON THE WEB REVEALED THEY USUALLY BLOW OUT BETWEEN 60,000-70,000 MILES.  THIS IS A MAJOR FLAW IN THE TRANSMISSION.  A PHONE CALL TO CHRYSLER  WAS USELESS.8JB",
