        "summary": "I'VE BEEN HAVING MULTIPLE PROBLEMS WITH MY 1998 PONTIAC SUNFIRE GT.  LAST MONTH I HAD A FUEL INJECTOR AND WATER HOSE GO BAD AND NEED REPLACED.  THE SUCTION HOSE PUMP FOR THE AC WAS LEAKING AND HAD TO BE REPLACED WITHIN THE PAST 3 WEEKS.  IN THE SAME TIME PERIOD, THE COMPRESSOR STARTED LEAKING.  I'VE HAD 2 DIFFERENT COMPRESSORS PUT IN, AND BOTH HAVE LEAKED STILL.  THE 3RD COMPRESSOR IS BEING INSTALLED TODAY, SO WE'LL SEE WHETHER IT LEAKS TOO.  A COMPRESSOR SHOULD REALLY LAST LONGER THAN 5 YEARS, AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE 3 COMPRESSORS IN A WEEK TRYING TO FIND ONE THAT DOESN'T LEAK.  THERE'S ALSO A CRACK IN THE WELDING THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED OR IT WILL START LEAKING.  ONE OF THE FAN PARTS WENT BAD, SO NOW LEVEL 1 ON THE FAN ADJUSTMENT DOESN'T WORK.   THIS SEEMS LIKE ALOT OF PROBLEMS IN A SHORT TIMEFRAME, ESPECIALLY WITH 3 PROBLEMS BEING FOR THE AIR CONDITIONING.  I'VE CONTACTED THE PONTIAC CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT, AND THEY CONTACTED A DEALERSHIP WHO SAID THAT PROBLEMS SHOULD BE EXPECTED AFTER 5 YEARS.  GUESS I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BUILD A BETTER CAR.   SO FAR, I'M OUT $1900 AND HAVEN'T HAD THE FAN OR THE WELDING CRACK FIXED YET.  I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HELP THAT COULD BE OFFERED.  *AK",
