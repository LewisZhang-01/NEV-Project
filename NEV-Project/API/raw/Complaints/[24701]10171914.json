THUS I CAN NOT CALL ON STAR OR HEAR THE CHIMES FROM THE REAR PARKING SENSOR.  THIS ISSUE IS NOT A REPEATABLE EVENT.  I HAVE NOT FOUND A WAY TO DUPLICATE THE EVENT.  I HAVE DETERMINED THAT IF I SHUT OFF THE CAR AND OPEN THE DOOR AND WAIT AT LEAST ONE MINUTE, THE SOUND WILL RESET AND WORK FINE.  EVERY 3 MONTHS WHEN I TAKE THE CAR BACK FOR OIL CHANGE I IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM, BUT SINCE IT CAN NOT BE DUPLICATED THE DEALER WILL NOT INVESTIGATE OR ATTEMPT TO REPAIR.  THE CONCERN IS THE NON-FUNCTIONING OF ON-STAR AND REAR PARKING SENSORS.  THIS ARE SAFETY FEATURES THAT CAN NOT BE USED IF REQUIRED IN AN EMERGENCY AND THE SOUND IS NOT WORKING.  *NM",
