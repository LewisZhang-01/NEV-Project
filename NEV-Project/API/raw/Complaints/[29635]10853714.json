AT FIRST, I WAS ABLE TO  RESET MY POWER STEERING BY TURNING THE CAR OFF AND BACK ON. NOW , I HAVE COMPLETELY LOST MY POWER STEERING. NOW THE POWER WILL GO OFF AND STAY OFF WHILE DRIVING. FORD MOTOR HAS RECALLED THE 2011 FORD FUSIONS WITH THE 3.5 L ENGINE BUT INSIST THE 2.5 L DO NOT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. I THINK THEY ARE WRONG AND SHOULD HAVE TO FIXED MY CAR FOR SAFETY REASONS. TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, MY FORD DEALERSHIP CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT MY CAR UNTIL ONE WEEK WHICH ONLY FORCES DRIVERS TO DRIVE CARS THAT ARE UNSAFE.",
