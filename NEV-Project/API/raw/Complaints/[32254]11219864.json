THIS IS 3,923 MILES OUTSIDE OF THE EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR A KNOWN TRANSMISSION ISSUE. THE QUOTE I WAS GIVEN TO REPLACE IS $8,900 (MORE THAN THE VALUE OF THE CAR). I NOTIFIED SUBARU CUSTOMER SERVICE TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE. THE SAID THEY WOULD ONLY PAY $3,500 AND I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REST. THIS SEEMS RIDICULOUS CONSIDERING THERE IS A KNOWN ISSUE. I HAVE A SMALL CHILD AND I AM TERRIFIED TO DRIVE IN THE CAR WITH HIM NOW.",
