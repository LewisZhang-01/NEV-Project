NOT ONLY CAN THE HEADLIGHTS OR BRAKE LIGHT SENSOR SWITCHES GO BAD AND JUST STOP WORKING, THEY OVERHEAT, DRAIN THE BATTERY, OVERWORK THE ALTERNATOR, WHICH THEN NEEDS TO BE REPLACED, THE FALL DISPLAYS EVERY GEAR ALL AT ONCE EVEN WHILE IN DRIVE AND DISPLAYING A SPEED THE VEHICLE IS TRAVELING. THE DOOR HANDLES BRAKE OFF, SO YOU CAN NOT ESCAPE THE DEATH TRAP.  THEY HAVE BLOWN HEAD GASKET, MANY SMALL OIL LEAKS, TIRE PRESSURE GAGE PROBLEMS, TIRES/WHEELS WON'T ALIGN, THIS BALDS THE TIRE LOP SIDED SO TIRE BLOW OUTS OCCUR MORE FREQUENTLY. HALF THE TONE IT WON'T EVEN GO, NOW OR WON'T START AT ALL. MANY MORE ISSUES WITH THIS VEHICLE, BUYER BEWARE, DO NOT BUY THESE CARS!  *TR",
