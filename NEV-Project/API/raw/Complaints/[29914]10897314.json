        "summary": "HAD TO MAKE A SUDDEN STOP WHEN A PEDESTRIAN WALKED OUT IN FRONT OF THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. MY BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR AND I REAR ENDED THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.  UPON ON INVESTIGATION IT WAS FOUND THAT ONE OF THE FRONT BRAKE LINES RUPTURED DUE TO THE HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE EMERGENCY STOP AND THE RUSTED BRAKE LINE. I HAVE OWNED THIS TRUCK SINCE NEW AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO RECALLS OR COMMUNICATIONS THAT THE BRAKE LINES WILL PREMATURELY CORRODE AND FAIL.  BRAKE LINES ARE NOT A NORMAL SERVICEABLE PART.  APPARENTLY, THIS IS TYPICAL OF THIS YEAR VEHICLE FROM GM.  PLEASE RECALL OR NOTIFY THE PUBLIC BECAUSE THIS IS A TIME BOMB WAITING TO KILL PEOPLE.  BRAKES ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR EMPHASIS ON AIR BAGS.  THE BRAKE LINES DIDN'T LAST AS LONG AS THE ENGINE, TRANSMISSION, BALL JOINTS, SHOCKS, ETC WHICH ARE ALL SERVICEABLE ITEMS AND EXPECTED TO BE REPLACED.  PLEASE STEP UP TO YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND GET THE VEHICLE OWNERS NOTIFIED AND GET THE VEHICLES OFF THE ROAD UNTIL THE BRAKE LINES ARE REPLACED.  MY 1941 CHEVROLET PICKUP HAS ORIGINAL BRAKE LINES IN BETTER CONDITION THAN MY 2005 CHEVROLET PICKUP.  PLEASE RECALL THESE VEHICLES.",
