WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION, AND AT RANDOM TIMES EVERY DAY, THE ENTIRE INSTRUMENT PANEL CLUSTER WILL GO DARK. BY DARK I MEAN ALL ILLUMINATED FEATURE ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL ARE INVISIBLE. THE CAR DOES NOT STALL, AND IT CAN STILL BE OPERATED, BUT I CAN NOT SEE MY SPEED, RPMS, OR ANY OPERATIONAL DATA, THEREBY CREATING A SAFETY HAZARD, ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT. THIS HAS HAPPENED INTERMITTENTLY SINCE I PURCHASED THE CAR.",
