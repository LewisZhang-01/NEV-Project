THE CAR IS STILL NOT REPAIRED AND I AM VERY FRUSTRATED.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN I START MY CAR, IT SHAKES REALLY BAD I WOULD HAVE TO WARM IT UP FOR 5 MINUTES.  SOMETIMES THE CAR DIES WHILE I AM DRIVING.  I WROTE A COMPLAINT LETTER TO THE RUSTY WALLACE BECAUSE I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE THERE AND THE SERVICE MANAGER (DAN TURK) SEEMS TO BE AVOIDING MY PHONE CALLS.  I NEED HELP!!  I WOULD LIKE TO ATTACH MY LETTER OF COMPLAINT (THAT I SENT TO THE DEALER) IF I COULD. THANK YOU.   *JB",
