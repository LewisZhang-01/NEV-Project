THIS CAUSES THE BRAKE PEDAL TO PULSE AND THE STEERING WHEEL TO ROTATE A FEW DEGREES LEFT AND RIGHT DURING BRAKING.  JEEP'S WARRANTY SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDES BRAKE ROTORS AFTER 12,000 MILES, LEADING ME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY ARE AWARE THAT THERE IS A DESIGN OR MATERIAL PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKE ROTORS.  ROTORS SHOULD LAST LONGER THAN THE BRAKE PADS.  *NLM",
