MY OIL CHANGE SERVICE SAID SATURN ENGINES WERE NOTORIOUS FOR BAD RINGS.  I TOOK TO SATURN DEALERSHIP.  THEY WANTED SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A NEW ENGINE.  I REPLACED ENGINE WITH A SATURN ENGINE WITH 23,000 MILES.  AFTER ANOTHER 40,000 MILES THE REPLACEMENT ENGINE EXHIBITED THE EXACT SAME BEHAVIOR.  I NOW NEED TO PURCHASE A THIRD ENGINE.",
