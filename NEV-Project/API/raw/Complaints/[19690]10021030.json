SO I E-MAILED THE MAIN OFFICE AND WAS TOLD IT WAS TOO OLD FOR THEM TO REPAIR. THIS IS NOT  WEAR AND TEAR PAINT DOES NOT JUST CHIP OFF A CAR GET DULL MAYBE BUT NOT CHIP OFF CAR. I WAS TOLD BY ONE OF THE CAR PAINTERS FROM CENTRAL CHEVROLET DEALER IN FREMONT CA THAT THEY  MIXED THE PAINT WITH THE PRIMER TO TAKE A SHORT CUT.  HE HAD SEEN MANY OF THESE AND WAS NOT ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I THINK THAT THIS SHOULD BE RECALLED PAINT SHOULD NOT CHIP OF THE CAR THIS IS NOT WEAR AND TEAR!!!!!!!!   *NLM",
