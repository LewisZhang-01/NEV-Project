IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING NEW TIRES, MY MECHANIC NOTICED ANOTHER WHEEL HAD A HOLE. I  HAVE TO PURCHASE 4 NEW WHEELS, AND NEW 4 TIRES FOR MY LIBERTY AT 37000. TIRES WERE CONSTANTLY NEEDING AIR, AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK. CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO PULL, AND CAUSED EXCESSIVE TIRE WEAR.  YES I STILL HAVE THE SECOND WHEEL WITH THE HOLE IN IT. I GUESS I'LL FIND OUT IF THE OTHER TWO WHEELS HAVE HOLES WHEN MY NEW WHEELS COME IN.  VERY DISCOURAGED!",
