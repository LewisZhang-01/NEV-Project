THE STEERING & BRAKES ARE COMPROMISED WHEN THE ENGINE STALLS.  TO RESTART THE ENGINE, THE HEADLIGHTS GO DARK FOR A MOMENT...THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER.  DECELERATING FROM AN EXPRESSWAY TO A SURFACE STREET, ON A CURVED EXIT RAMP , AT NIGHT MAKES FOR AN OUT OF CONTROL SITUATION WHERE THE DRIVER CAN NOT SEE BECAUSE OF ENGINE FAILURE!  I'VE REPLACED THE THROTTLE POSITION CENSOR [TPS] WITH NO IMPROVEMENT.  THE DEALER OFFERS REPLACEMENT OF PARTS $1500, AND NO GUARANTEE OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM.  THE VEHICLE IS USELESS TO ME FORE IT IS A HAZARD TO BE ON THE ROAD...FOR ME AND ANYONE ELSE DRIVING NEAR ME. *TR",
