        "summary": "THE BRAKES ON MY 2007 NISSAN XTERRA WOULD NOT FULLY ACTIVATE AND ALMOST CAUSED ME TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT. I WAS ENTERING I-95 SOUTHBOUND AND TRAFFIC WAS STOPPED ON THE RAMP FROM LEM TURNER ROAD. I WAS TRAVELING AT APPROXIMATELY 25 MPH WHEN THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT STOP. THERE WAS A LIGHT RAIN AND I HAD RECENTLY DRIVEN THROUGH STANDING WATER WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY ONE INCH DEEP. THE VEHICLE TRAVELED APPROXIMATELY EIGHT CAR LENGTHS, DURING WHICH TIME I HAD THE BRAKE PEDAL FULLY DEPRESSED, BEFORE COMING TO A STOP WITHIN A FEW FEET OF A STOPPED CAR. I DID NOT DEPRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL FULLY UNTIL I FOUND THAT THE BRAKES WERE NOT WORKING IN A NORMAL MANNER. I EXITED THE INTERSTATE, AND ATTEMPTED TO DUPLICATE THE SYMPTOMS IN A VACANT PARKING LOT AT ROOSEVELT MALL, BUT WAS UNABLE. AFTER CONTINUING HOME, THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN AS I ATTEMPTED TO STOP TO ENTER RAMP ONTO 20TH ST EXPRESSWAY FROM MAIN STREET. THIS VEHICLE ONLY HAS 5800 MILES ON IT. I HAVE A CLEAN MOTOR VEHICLE RECORD AND AM CONSIDERED A SAFE DRIVER BY THE STATE OF FLORIDA. THIS VERY WELL COULD HAVE ENDED MUCH DIFFERENTLY HAD I NOT BEEN DRIVING DEFENSIVELY. I AM GOING TO CONTACT THE DEALERSHIP IN THE MORNING, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 06, 2007 IN ORDER TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM ADDRESSED.  *JB",
