        "summary": "WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL PROBLEMS WITH THE VAN, THE TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN OVERHAULED, THE ALTERNATOR REPLACED, THE BATTERY REPLACED, SERVICE BULLETINS REPAIRED AND AT THE PRESENT TIME THE VAN IS STILL NOT REPAIRED.  WE ARE WAITING FOR THE RESULTS OF ARBITRATION.  THE VAN RUNS VERY ROUGH AND SEEMS TO WANT TO IDLE OR STALL OUT.  THIS I AM AFRAID WILL GET WORSE BECAUSE THE DEALERSHIP SAYS THAT IT IS NORMAL ENGINE SOUNDS.  I TRAVEL OUT OF TOWN ALOT A FEAR THAT THE ENGINE IS GOING TO STALL AND I WILL BE REAR ENDED OR WORSE.  I HAVE (2) YOUNG CHILDREN AND FEAR THAT THE VAN WILL EVENTUALLY STALL OUT AND WE GET IN AN ACCIDENT OR I AM LEFT STRANDED SIDE THE ROAD.  I WILL FORWARD COPIES OF ALL INVOICES AND REPAIRS.  AT THIS POINT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS SUGGESTED THAT WE MAY WISH TO TALK WITH A LAWYER ABOUT THE LEMON LAW.  DAIMLER CHRYSLER STATES THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD ENOUGH PROBLEMS WITH THE VAN FOR IT TO BE CONSIDERED UNDER THE NC LEMON LAW.  DAIMLER HAS NOT ONCE COME DOWN TO LOOK AT THE VAN, YET THEY HAVE TOLD US ON TWO DIFFERENT OCCASIONS THAT SOMEONE WOULD BE AT THE DEALERSHIP. THE VAN IS ONLY 1 1/2 YEARS OLD WITH A LITTLE OVER 25,000 MILES ON IT IN WHICH THE DEALERSHIP PUT ROUGHLY 800 MILES ON TRYING TO MAKE REPAIRS AND I STILL HAVE THREE PROBLEMS THAT ARE STILL NOT REPAIRED.  THEY ARE THE STALLING AND IDLING OF THE VAN, JERKING OCCASIONALLY WHEN YOU SLOW DOWN, AND A WHINING NOISE IN THE STEERING. TS",
