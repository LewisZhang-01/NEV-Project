I HAD IT TOWED TO A LOCAL REPAIR SHOP WHO BELIEVES THAT THE \"WRIST PIN\" MAY HAVE FAILED AND THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT FOR SURE IS TO TEAR IT DOWN. THEY DON'T RECOMMEND REPAIRING DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF WORK AND OTHER POTENTIAL ENGINE PROBLEMS BUT TO REPLACE THE WHOLE ENGINE. COST $2000 - $3000.   I CALLED CHRYSLER AND RECEIVED A FILE NUMBER. THEY WILL NOT COMMIT TO ANYTHING UNTIL A AUTHORIZE CHRYSLER REPAIR SHOP DIAGNOSIS THE PROBLEM AND OF COURSE I WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THE DIAGNOSIS.  THE VEHICLE IS ONLY 8 YEARS OLD AND ONLY HAS 55,000 MILES ON IT. I WOULD THINK AN ENGINE HAS A LONGER LIFE THAN THAT! *JB",
