THE CAR IS NOW AT 96K AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON INDICATING A P1870 CODE WHICH TRIGGERS THE LIGHT AND IS CAUSED BY A WORN TCC APPLY VALVE ON THE 4T60E GM TRANSMISSIONS.  HAVE HEARD FROM SEVERAL OTHER INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS ON THEIR 1997 4T60E TRANSMISSIONS.  THIS ITEM SHOULD BE RECALLED SINCE IT IS ONLY THE CONTROL VALVE BODY WITHIN THE TRANSMISSION THAT NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED WITH A REVISED TCC REGULATOR AND ISOLATOR VALVES ALONG WITH THE TORQUE CONVERTER CLUTCH.  A RECALL NEEDS TO BE ON THE 97 PONTIAC GRAND AM CARS AND ALL CARS WITH 4T60E TRANSMISSIONS WHICH WILL RESULT IN OTHER PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VALVES AND TORQUE CONVERTER. TS",
