        "summary": "EVER SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED, THE DRIVERS SEAT EMITTED A CLICKING SOUND AND A SLIGHT FEELING OF MOVEMENT IN THE SEAT WHEN THE CAR LUNGES FORWARD OR IS STOPPED.  WE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE ISSUE SEVERAL TIMES.  THIS IS DOCUMENTED ON MY BILLS WITH MILEAGE READING 19K AND 35K MILES.  THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSE OF THE SOUND AND MOVEMENT.  FINALLY, WHEN THE CAR HAD 40K MILES ON IT (AFTER THE WARRANTY PERIOD) THE ISSUE WAS IDENTIFIED.  A FACTORY REP WAS ON HAND THAT DAY AT THE DEALERSHIP AND IDENTIFIED THAT THERE WAS PLAY IN THE SEAT TRACK.  I ASKED THAT THIS BE COVERED AND FIXED UNDER VW'S GOODWILL PROGRAM AND APPEALED THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE LIFE OF THE CAR (DURING THE WARRANTY).  I WAS DENIED THIS CLAIM AS THE REP SAID THAT THE SEAT DID NOT POSE ANY SAFETY THREATS AND THIS RESULTED FROM NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR.  I FELT THAT THIS WAS NOT A FARE DETERMINATION OF THIS CASE SO I APPEALED TWICE TO VW (CASE # 60127133).  THEY STATED TWICE THAT THEY HAD TO STAND BY THE DETERMINATION OF THE REP ON HAND THAT DAY AND WOULD NOT FIX THE ISSUE (COST = OVER $800).  I HAVE BEEN ADVISED BY CONSUMERS UNION TO CONTACT YOU AS THEY STATED THAT ANY PLAY IN THE SEAT TRACK IS IN FACT A SAFETY ISSUE... *JB  *NM",
