THIS VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED 02/01/03 AND HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP SEVEN TIMES FOR A TOTAL OUT-OF-SERVICE TIME OF OVER A MONTH.  THE ENTIRE REAR END WAS REPLACED BUT THE VEHICLE STILL LEAKS OIL.  THE ACCELERATION PROBLEMS ARE POSING VERY DANGEROUS DRIVING CONDITIONS FOR ME, AS POWER LACKS SEVERELY BETWEEN 2000-4000 RPM.  THE FRONT END CLICKS, GRINDS, CLUNKS, AND SQUEAKS DURING DRIVING.  ON MOST OCCASIONS WHILE IN THE SHOP, THE SERVICE DEPARTMENTS DOCUMENTED THAT THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE MY CONCERNS EVEN AFTER THEY VERBALLY CONFIRMED MY COMPLAINTS DURING TEST DRIVES WITH ME.  ON SOME OCCASIONS, THEN ATTEMPTED TO MAKE REPAIRS WITHOUT DOCUMENTING IT TO AVOID \"LEMON LAW\" STATUS.  THIS VEHICLE IS UNSAFE, UNRELIABLE, AND HAZARDOUS TO DRIVE.  MLG   *NLM",
