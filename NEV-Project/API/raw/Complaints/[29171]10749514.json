AT FIRST IT WAS JUST A SMALL SPOT AT THE BACK OF THE ROOF AND NOW IT IS MANIFESTING TO ALL OVER THE ROOF.  I RECEIVED A RECALL FOR 2007 CIVICS FOR PAINT PEELING AND I BROUGHT MY VEHICLE TO MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP WHERE I WAS TOLD THAT MY VIN NUMBER WAS NOT COVERED.  I FEEL AS HONDA IS MOST ASSUREDLY BEING DECEITFUL WITH THEIR CUSTOMERBASE AND CERTAINLY NOT TAKING CARE OF THEM AS THEY SHOULD.  I FELT SAFE AND CONFIDENT PURCHASING A HONDA JUST KNOWING THEY WOULD STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT AND KNEW I WOULD NOT HAVE ISSUES IN THE END.  SILLY ME.",
