        "summary": "2006 HHR HAD BEEN RUNNING ROUGHLY AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT HAD BEEN COMING ON (INTERMITTENTLY AT FIRST). WAS TOLD TO MAKE SURE GAS CAP WAS SECURELY SEATED, ADD SOME GASOLINE TREATMENT, USE HIGHER GRADE GASOLINE - ALL OF WHICH HELPED SOME FOR A SHORT WHILE. AFTER 3 WEEKS OF INTERMITTENT EPISODES, FINALLY TOOK IT TO A GM DEALERSHIP WHERE THE CODE INDICATED THAT THE #1 CYLINDER IGNITION COIL NEEDED REPLACING, MECHANIC ALSO RECOMMENDED REPLACING ALL SPARK PLUGS AND DOING AN INJECTION FLUSH. HAD THE #1 CYLINDER COIL REPLACED AND REPLACED ALL SPARK PLUGS. ABOUT 1 MONTH AFTER WORK WAS DONE, CAR RESUMED RUNNING ROUGH WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMING BACK ON. TOOK CAR BACK TO SAME GM DEALERSHIP, THIS TIME THEY TOLD ME THAT I COULDN'T DRIVE THE CAR ANYMORE UNTIL ALL SIX FUEL INJECTORS WERE REPLACED. FOUND COPY OF GM(?) BULLETIN #08-06-04-001 DESCRIBING PROBLEM AND HOW  TO CORRECT IT. WE  HAVE THE DEFECTIVE INJECTORS. ALL THIS WORK COST US A TOTAL OF $922, LOSS OF USE OF THE VEHICLE FOR 4 DAYS, AND 4 TRIPS TO THE DEALERSHIP (APPROX. 25 MILES EACH TRIP). SENT EMAIL TO CHEVROLET EXPLAINING PROBLEMS AND ASKING FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF $922, HAVE RECEIVED NO RESPONSE TO DATE.   *TR",
