VAN ENGINE WAS MAKING KNOCKING NOISE. VAN WAS SENT TO DEALER. DEALER DETERMINED THAT VEHICLE HAD LARGE VOLUME OF WATER IN INTAKE SYSTEM AND SAID IT WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. CONSUMER APPEALED TO FORD MOTOR CO. FORD SENT FIELD ENGINEER WHO AGREED WITH FINDINGS; ADDING THAT THE VEHICLE IS DESIGNED TO INGEST A SMALL AMOUNT OF WATER, BUT NOT THAT VOLUME OF WATER, THEREFORE IT WAS CONSUMERS FAULT. CONSUMER SAYS THAT IF THAT VOLUME OF WATER CAN ENTER THE VEHICLES INTAKE SYSTEM UNDER NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS THEN THERE MUST BE A DESIGN FLAW OR DEFECTIVE PART. NOWHERE IN OWNERS MANUAL DOES IT SAY NOT TO OPERATE VEHICLE ON RAINY DAYS, AND THE DEALER SAYS THERE IS NO SIGN THAT THE VEHICLE WAS SUBMERGED OR DRIVEN THROUGH DEEP WATER. CONSUMER CHECKED OTHER E350'S (EARLIER MODEL YEARS) IN FLEET AND FOUND EVIDENCE OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF WATER IN THE INTAKE SYSTEM LEADING THE CONSUMER TO BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM MAY BE A DEFECT WITH THE 2002 MODEL YEAR OR A DESIGN FLAW.   *NLM",
