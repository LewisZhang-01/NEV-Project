SINCE THE FIRST DAY WE HAD THE VEHICLE THERE HAS BEEN A CLEARANCE PROBLEM - WHEN GOING UP OR DOWN A NORMAL GARAGE OR DRIVEWAY INCLINE AT THE SLOWEST  SPEED (EVEN BELOW 5 MPH), THE CAR BOTTOMS OUT.  WE HAVE ADVISED BOTH PAUL CONTE AND THE GM CHEVY DIVISION OF THIS IMMEDIATELY AND REPEATEDLY. THEIR RESPONSE WAS, THE VEHICLE HAD A DESIGN FLAW.  WE DO NOT FEEL CHEVROLET'S DESIGN FLAW SHOULD BE THE CONSUMER'S ISSUE. THIS COULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE.     *JB",
