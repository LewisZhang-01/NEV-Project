WHEN I LIMPED IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP IMMEDIATELY AFTER THIS OCCURRED I WAS TOLD IT NEEDED TO BE TESTED TO SEE IF THE PROBLEM WAS INTERNAL TO THE TRANSMISSION OR NOT.  UNFORTUNATELY, PER THEIR TEST, IT WAS AND NOW THEY WANT $3200 TO REPLACE IT WITH A  NEW ONE.    MY UNDERSTANDING FROM DOING RESEARCH (UNFORTUNATELY WELL AFTER I BOUGHT THIS CAR) IS THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM COMMON TO MAZDA , ESPECIALLY THE 626'S    I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THIS PROBLEM IS AS PREVALENT AS IT APPEARS TO BE WHY THERE HAS NOT BEEN A RECALL AS THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE RELATED TO THE MAZDA TRANSMISSION DESIGN.*JB",
