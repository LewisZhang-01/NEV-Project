        "summary": "VEHICLE IS ONLY 8 YEARS OLD. I CONSTANTLY HAVE THIS PROBLEM. THE FIRST TIME I HAD THIS PROBLEM I SLID WHILE TRYING TO HOLD BRAKES, THERE WAS ALSO A LOT OF WEIRD SOUNDS AND THE REAR END DID NOT FEEL STURDY. I TOOK IT TO MY MECHANIC AND HE FOUND METAL BRACKET WELDED TO THE REAR AXLE THAT HOLDS THE UPPER CONTROL ARMS HAD COMPLETELY FAILED! THE NORMAL TORQUE FROM THE REAR AXLE WAS BROKEN BOTH BRACKETS HOLDING THE UPPER CONTROL ARM TO THE CARS FRAME. ALL THAT IS HOLDING THE REAR AXLE IN PLACE IS THE LOWER CONTROL ARMS AND THE SWAY BARS. THERE ARE NO WEEP HOLES TO ALLOW WATER TO DRAIN OUT OF THE BRACKET WELDMENT, CAUSING WATER TO FILL THE CUP-LIKE CONDITION CREATED. THIS CONDITION HAS (AN WILL) CAUSE PREMATURE FAILURE OF ALL KIA SORENTO REAR AXLE/UPPER CONTROL ARM CONNECTIONS. WHILE DRIVING THE REAR AXLE COULD BECOME DETACHED FROM THE VEHICLE DUE TO EXCESSIVE STRESS PLACED ON THE REMAINING PARTS. REGULAR DRIVING COULD CAUSE A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE, AND RENDER THE VEHICLE UNCONTROLLABLE, WITH THE LIKELIHOOD OF MASSIVE INJURY AND POSSIBLY DEATH AS A RESULT!!! HE ALSO SAID THAT IT CANNOT BE REPAIRED. THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR ME BECAUSE I STILL HAVE A CAR NOTE TO PAY. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS CONDITION!!! THESE CARS NEED TO BE RECALLED NOW BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED!!!  *KB",
