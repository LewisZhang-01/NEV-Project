        "summary": "I HAVE HAD VERY FEW PROBLEMS WITH MY TRUCK, IN FACT I AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT.  THE ONLY PROBLEMS I HAVE HAD WAS THE SEAT LEVER BREAKING (FIXED NOW WITH VICE-GRIPS), AND THE CRUISE CONTROL.  THE RESUME SPEED \"R/A\"  BUTTON ON THE WAND WAS PRESSED TO RETURN TO THE SPEED OF 55 MPH, UPON DOING SO, VEHICLE REVVED PAST THE RED-LINE MARK AND ACCELERATED UNCONTROLLABLY, RESULT WAS MY GETTING ARRESTED AND GOING TO COURT OVER IT.  TOOK TO REPAIR SHOP AND THEY SAID THAT IT WAS A PROBLEM IN THE WAND, WHICH FIGURES BECAUSE MY GIRLFRIEND AT THE TIME HAD HIT THE WAND AND MESSED BROKE IT AND I FIXED IT WITH ONE I GOT OFF A TOTALED SONOMA.  TRUCK IS A GREAT TRUCK AND I FIND MOST OF THE PROBLEMS PEOPLE HAVE WITH THESE TRUCKS IS THEY DON'T TAKE CARE OF THEM, EVERY PROBLEM THAT I HAD  SEEN POSTED ABOUT THEM WAS THE IDIOT DRIVER'S FAULT FOR POOR MAINTENANCE.  I MAINTAIN MY TRUCK PROPERLY (AS THE BOOK SAYS TO AND A LITTLE BETTER) AND I'VE HAD NO PROBLEMS, THEN AGAIN I DO DOG MY TRUCK OUT, MUD-BOG, ROCK-CLIMB IN IT, AND RACE IT AT THE TRACK...AND NO PROBLEMS.  TRUCK HAS 110,589 MILES ON IT AND ITS AS GOOD AS NEW, MINUS THE SEAT LEVERS AND CRUISE CONTROL.   *JB",
