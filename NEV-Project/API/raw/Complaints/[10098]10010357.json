        "summary": "I OWN A 1999 CHRYSLER CONCORD (PURCHASED NEW) AND WAS TOLD THAT MY ENGINE WAS \"SHOT\".  TO REPLACE IT WILL COST $5,000.  THIS INCLUDED $3,800 FOR THE REBUILT ENGINE AND $1,200 FOR LABOR.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!!  IT HAS 78,000 MILES ON IT AND I HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN IT IN FOR SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE.  FOR A CAR THAT COST OVER $22,000 TO NEED THIS KIND OF REPAIR AT THESE FEW MILES IS UNACCEPTABLE TO ME. PERHAPS I AM NAIVE.   I WONDER HOW MANY PROBLEMS WITH THE ENGINE OTHERS HAVE ENCOUNTERED, BUT HAVEN'T OFFICIALLY REPORTED.  MANY I AM SURE.  I AM WORKING FULL-TIME AS WELL AS PART-TIME TO SAVE MONEY FOR A DOWN PAYMENT TO PURCHASE A HOUSE THIS YEAR.  THANKS TO MY  ENGINE BEING \"SHOT\" - MY HUSBAND AND I WILL HAVE TO FORGO OUR DREAM OF OWNING A HOME ANYTIME SOON.  HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET PAST THIS AND THE INTEREST RATES WILL STAY LOW ENOUGH FOR OUR TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER TO HAVE CHRISTMAS IN HER OWN HOME IN 2004!!!*JB",
