        "summary": "ON THE 1997 FORD ESCORT THE AIRBAG CONTROL MODULE IS INSTALLED DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH THE HEATER CORE.  ON MY CAR THE HEATER CORE DEVELOPED A LEAK AND ANTIFREEZE FLOWED OVER THE AIRBAG CONTROL MODULE AND THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR ASSOCIATED WITH IT.  THIS RESULTED IN BURNT INSULATION ON THE WIRING FOR THE AIRBAG CONTROL AND BLOWING THE ASSOCIATED FUSE.  IT CAME VERY CLOSE TO CAUSING A FIRE.   THE MAIN PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT YOU DO NOT GET INDICATIONS OF AN ANTIFREEZE LEAK UNTIL IT IS TO LATE AND THE AIR BAG SYSTEM IS NO LONGER USABLE.*JB",
