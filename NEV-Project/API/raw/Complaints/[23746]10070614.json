FORD SHOULD HAVE SOME LIABILITY REGARDLESS IF THIS WAS PURCHASED USED OR NOT SINCE IT IS SO LOW MILEAGE AND THE YEAR MAKE OF IT AND IT IS UNDER THE MANUFACTURERS WARRANTY. TRANSMISSION SLIPPING AND NOT STAYING IN GEAR.  RETURNED TO DEALER AND THEY REPLACED A SENSOR SAYING THERE WAS 'NO RESPONSE' FROM THE  SENSOR AND IT WAS RULED AS 'BAD'.  AGAIN IN JULY THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED BECAUSE IT WAS STILL SLIPPING, SMELLED OF BURNING RUBBER...TRANSMISSION WAS THEN REBUILT BY THE DEALER AS IT HAD A LOT OF ISSUES ONCE THEY OPENED UP THE TRANS.  NOW HERE LESS THAN 4 WEEKS AFTER THAT LAST REPAIR WHICH WAS THE SECOND IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS. TRANSMISSION IS SLIPPING AND NOT CHANGING GEARS PROPERLY. TOOK THIS VEHICLE ON A LONGER DURATION TRIP THAN USUAL ALONG WITH HIGH FREEWAY SPEEDS. ONCE THE VEHICLE GETS NEAR 70 MPH THE TRANS STICKS AND THE VEHICLE LOSES ACCELERATION. THE TRANS TROUBLE I AM HAVING WITH THIS EXPEDITION IS RIDICULOUS.",
