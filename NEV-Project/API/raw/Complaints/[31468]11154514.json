THE LIGHT OUTPUT IS EXTREMELY LOW EVEN AFTER REPLACING THE BULBS WITH SYLVANIA ZXE BULBS AND THEN, AFTER THESE WERE INEFFECTIVE, LED REPLACEMENTS.  DRIVING THIS VEHICLE IN LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS IS COMPLETELY UNSAFE UNLESS THE HIGH BEAMS ARE USED, WHICH THEN CAUSES ISSUES TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS SIMILAR OCCURRENCES READILY FINDABLE THROUGH INTERNET SEARCHES.  IT APPEARS THAT GM SHOULD DETERMINE AND PROVIDE A LONG TERM SOLUTION TO THIS SAFETY ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN A NOTICEABLE ISSUE WITH OUR VEHICLE FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS.",
