I LOOKED AT THE DIPSTICK AND THERE WAS LESS THAN 1/16TH OF AN INCH OF OIL. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER. THEY FOUND THE TIMING BELT WAS STRIPPED. THEY ALSO FOUND THAT TWO OF THE VALVES WERE BENT. ALL THESE WERE REPLACED BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT MORE DAMAGE HAS OCCURED TO THE ENGINE BY DRIVING WITHOUT OIL.",
