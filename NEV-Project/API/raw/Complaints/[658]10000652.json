THERE ARE NUMEROUS PROBLEMS COMPLAINTS OF AIRBAGS NOT GOING OFF IN FRONTAL COLLISIONS, BUT A SIDE IMPACT AT 5 MPH CAUSED THE AIRBAG TO GO OFF, WHICH IN TURN ALSO TWISTED THE DASH BOARD AND BROKE THE FRONT WINDSHIELD. THE ACTUAL CRASH ITSELF CAUSED LESS THEN $500 OF DAMAGE, IT IS THE AIRBAG, WINDSHIELD, AND DASH BOARD THAT CAUSED ALL OF THE DAMAGE.",
