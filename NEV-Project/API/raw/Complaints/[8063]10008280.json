I THEN TOOK IT BACK TO FORD BECAUSE THE BRAKES WERE STILL DOING THE SAME THING, ONCE AGAIN THEY MACHINED THE ROTORS DOWN TO THE LOWEST THICKNESS, THE BRAKES CONTINUED TO MAKE NOISE AND THE PEDAL IS NOW SLOPPY. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE IS NO TSB REPORT ON THIS PROBLEM, BUT YET I FIND ON THE INTERNET. THE BULLTIN # IS 15910 AND #15249. I HAVE REPORTED THIS TO FORD AND WAS TOLD THAT WHAT EVER THE DEALER HAD TO SAY WAS THE WAY IT WAS, BECAUSE THEY WERE A BLUE OVAL DEALER. *JB",
