        "summary": "COLD MORNING STARTS, ENG: 7.3DIESEL.  PROBLEM STARTED AROUND DEC. 31,2001.  ON FIRST START ENG. IS SLOW TO START, WHEN IT DOES START IT GOES FROM 300RPM TO 1200RPM ABOUT THREE TIMES AND THEN SETTLES DOWN ON 800RPM'S AND RUNS OK. THE VEH. HAS BEEN IN APPROX.  4 OR 5 TIMES FOR THIS PROBLEM. THE DEALER  SHOWS THE VEH, HAS BEEN IN TWICE FOR THIS PROBLEM. I HAVE  TALKED  WITH  OTHER FORD TRUCK OWNERS  WITH A 7,3 DIESEL  ENG. AND NO ONE HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM. THE DEALER TELLS ME THAT THIS IS NORMAL FOR THE 7.3DI IN COLD WEATHER. QUESTION: IF THIS IS NORMAL WHY DID IT TAKE ALMOST A YEAR FOR THIS TO START.  OTHER PROBLEMS: 1. AARM REMAN INJ PKG #8 CYL REPLACED. 2. WARPED ROTORS (FRONT), WARPED PADS HEAT CRACKED, CALIPERS REPLACED. 3. 50 MILES ON TRUCK, TRUCK PULLED TO THE RIGHT ALL THE TIME,  TOOK INTO DEALER 4 TIMES, (CARSON CITY), DEALER IN FALLON CAME TO MY HOUSE TOOK THE VEH. TO FALLON & FIXED PULLING PROBLEM. 4. POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE (PCM) REPLACED. 5. EGR PRESSURE FEEDBACK-PFE/EXHAUST BACK PRESSURE -EBP-REPLACED. 6. DEALER INSTALLED FUEL HEATER KIT , SOP TOP WATER FUEL HEATER. ( ALL OF THIS & THIS DIESEL STILL GOES FROM 300RPM TO 1200RPM).  I TALKED TO A DIESEL SHOP IN RENO, NV. AND HE  SAID THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS DIESEL.  I HATE TO  THINK WHAT THIS IS DOING TO THE INTERNAL PARTS OF THIS ENG. I WOULD THINK THAT THE BEARINGS AT 300RPM ARE GETTING VERY LITTLE OIL PRESSURE. ( HOW EVER THE DEALER SAID THIS IS NORMAL AND THAT I SHOULD PLUG IN THE ENG. HEATER. QUESTION: HOW DO YOU PLUG IN WHEN YOU ARE ON VACATION OR OUT FISHING WHICH I DO ALOT.",
