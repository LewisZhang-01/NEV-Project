        "summary": "THE 2007 HYUNDAI SONATA GLS  4 CYLINDER 2.4 L, AT 39 225 MILES, THE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT STAYED ON. I TOOK  IT TO THE CIRCLE HYUNDAI DEALER IN SHREWSBURY NJ TO CHECK IT OUT.  THE MECHANIC LOOKED AT THE CAR AND I WAS INFORMED THAT THE SEAT BELT PRE TENSIONER NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND THAT IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER  WARRANTY. THE COST TO ME OUT OF POCKET WOULD BE $ 450.00  I DID NOT HAVE THE REPAIR COMPLETED.  I HAVE READ MANY, CLOSE TO 100 COMPLAINTS ON JUST THIS SAME ISSUE, ON JUST THIS SAME VEHICLE MODEL AND  MAKE  BEING REPORTED ON THIS NHTSA WEBSITE.   IT IS OVERDUE FOR A RECALL OF THIS PROBLEM ON THE  2007 HYUNDAI SONATA.  THE OWNERS OF THIS MAKE AND MODEL ARE A RISK OF INJURY TO THEIR PERSONS SHOULD  THEY BE INVOLVED IN A CAR CRASH AND THE AIRBAG NOT RESPONDING AND PROTECTING THE OCCUPANTS..  I HAVE ALSO READ THAT OTHER OWNERS OF THIS YEAR, MAKE AND MODEL HAVE HAD MANY OF THE SAME MECHANICAL   PROBLEMS AND POSTED THEM HERE ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE AND HAVE PAID OUT OF THEIR POCKETS TO REPAIR THEIR VEHICLES.  REPAIRS SUCH AS REAR DISC BRAKES THAT ARE STAYING ONTO THE REAR ROTORS, CALIPER NOT RELEASING AND WEARING OUT THE DISC PADS AND ROTORS PREMATURELY, ALSO  THE DRIVER AND  PASSENGER SUN VISORS THAT DROP DOWN AND BLOCK YOUR LINE OF SIGHT, AND NEARLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  LOYAL OWNERS OF THESE HYUNDAI  VEHICLES SHOULD BE REIMBURSED FOR THE REPAIR COSTS TO THEM TO KEEP THE CARS SAFE.  ACTION SHOULD BE  TAKEN TO START A RECALL OF THESE MANY MANUFACTURING DEFECTS THAT CAN HARM OR INJURY TO THE OCCUPANTS  OF THESE VEHICLES. *TR",
