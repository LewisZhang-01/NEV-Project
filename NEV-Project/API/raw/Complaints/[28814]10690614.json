HAD THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP PUT IT ON THE MACHINE SAID IT WAS SOMETHING WITH EMISSIONS THAT WOULD RUN AROUND 2K TO REPAIR AT THE LEXUS DEALERSHIP.  VEHICLE RUNS PERFECT.  LIGHTS WILL GO OFF AT RANDOM TIMES BUT THEN COME BACK ON.  THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS AND THE VEHICLE IS STILL RUNNING GREAT.  OTHER OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM ACCORDING TO MY GOOGLE INQUIRIES.  I ALSO HAVE HAD MY ENTIRE DASHBOARD CRACK WHICH I UNDERSTAND LEXUS WILL BE FIXING AT NO COST TO THE CONSUMER.   *JS",
