OF TALLADEGA ALABAMA. DAYS LATER THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN, COLUMN LOCKING WHILE IN MOTION, EVEN THOUGH GM SAID THE RECALL WOULD PREVENT THIS DANGEROUS MALFUNCTION FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. FURTHERMORE IN THE PROCESS OF PERFORMING THE RECALL SERVICE, COLONIAL CHEVROLET-BUICK, INC. DAMAGED AND REPLACED THE CAR'S RADIATOR. UPON FURTHER INSPECTION I FOUND THAT THE RADIATOR WAS NOT REINSTALLED PROPERLY AND ITS HOUSING IS BROKEN. I AM UNAWARE OF WHAT POSSIBLE DANGERS MAY BE PRESENT DUE TO THE IMPROPERLY POSITIONED RADIATOR, AND HAVE DISCONTINUED USE OF THE VEHICLE PENDING FURTHER INVESTIGATION IN THIS MATTER AND THE COLUMN LOCKING AGAIN. FOLLOWING SERVICE, THE CAR WAS DRIVEN TO A TIRE SHOP AT COLONIAL'S RECOMMENDATION AND THEN STRAIGHT HOME. THE CAR HAS NOT LEFT THE HOUSE SINCE AS THE SECOND INSTANCE OF THE COLUMN LOCKING AT SPEED OCCURED ON MY HOME'S DRIVEWAY.*AK",
