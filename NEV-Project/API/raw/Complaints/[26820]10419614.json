        "summary": "I HAVE A 2007 FORD 500 THAT STARTED SURGING FORWARD AND BACKWARD.  I TOOK THE CAR AND MY EXTENDED WARRANTY TO A FORD DEALERSHIP ONLY TO LEARN THAT THE DEALER THAT I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM HAD BACK-DATED MY WARRANTY TO THE TIME THE CAR WAS PUT IN SERVICE.  (I HAD PURCHASED THE CAR AS A \"PROGRAM\" CAR.)  MY WARRANTY HAD RUN OUT ACCORDING TO THEM 6 DAYS BEFORE I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP.  I WROTE A LETTER TO FORD AND THEY REFUSED TO HONOR IT EVEN THOUGH I THOUGHT I HAD PURCHASED A 5 YEAR, 100,000 MILE WARRANTY.  THE CAR IS STILL SURGING FORWARD AND BACKWARD AND FORD REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING.  I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER FORD PRODUCT.  I HAVE OWNED LINCOLNS AND FORDS ALL OF MY LIFE AND I WILL NEVER GET ANOTHER ONE.  I CANNOT BELIEVE FORD REFUSES TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS.  THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SAFETY HAZARD THAT FORD NEEDS TO REPAIR.  SEEING ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE SENT IN, FORD KNOWS THAT THEY ARE IN THE WRONG AND STILL THEY DO NOTHING.  *KB",
