        "summary": "I PURCHASED 4 GOODYEAR ASSURANCE TOURING TIRES (P225/60R17 98T) FROM SAM'S CLUB IN MAY, 2011.  THEY'VE BEEN REGULARLY INSPECTED, BALANCED AND ROTATED AS PART OF SAM'S CLUB TIRE WARRANTIES.  ON JANUARY 28, 2011, WE HAPPENED TO PARK THE VAN JUST RIGHT SO THAT THE TIRES WERE TURNED SHARPLY TO THE LEFT.  AT THAT TIME IT WAS VISIBLY NOTICEABLE THAT THERE WAS A HUGE PIECE OF RUBBER MISSING (ABOUT 3-4 INCHES LONG AND 3 INCHES WIDE) FROM THE SIDEWALL AND METAL WAS EXPOSED. WE TOOK THE VAN TO SAM'S WHERE THEY FIRST TRIED TO SAY IT WAS DUE TO ALIGNMENT ISSUES (THE VAN HAD RECENTLY HAD THE ALIGNMENT FIXED), BUT WHEN IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT IT WAS NOT WORN COMPLETELY AROUND AND ONLY ON ONE SPOT, THEY REPLACED THE TIRE.  WE THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT. ABOUT 2 MONTHS LATER, I WOKE UP TO DRIVE THE KIDS TO SCHOOL AND TIRE #2 WAS FLAT.  BROUGHT IT IN TO SAM'S, THEY FOUND A NAIL OR SOMETHING IN IT, AND PLUGGED IT. BUT WHEN THEY TESTED IT LATER, IT WASN'T HOLDING AIR. THE SIDEWALL HAD A CRACK IN IT, NOT REPLACEABLE. CHANGED TIRE #2. APRIL 30, TRY TO LEAVE TO PICK UP KIDS FROM SCHOOL, TIRE #3 IS FLAT (HAD JUST DRIVEN ON IT THAT MORNING). TAKE IT TO SAM'S, HUGE CRACK IN THE SIDEWALL. AT THIS POINT, ITS NOT REALLY FUNNY ANYMORE. WONDERING WHAT KIND OF RECALL THIS TIRE MAY BE UNDER BECAUSE ITS NOT AVAILABLE AT THE STORE ANYMORE. JUNE 24, THE VAN WAS SHAKING AS WE WERE DRIVING, PULLED OVER, AND SURE ENOUGH, HUGE GASH OF EXPOSED METAL ON THE INSIDE SIDEWALL. FOUR TIRES IN LESS THAN 6 MONTHS, RUINED. TIRES RATED FOR 70,000 MILES AND WITH LESS THAN 25,000 MILES ON THEM. ALL HOLES, CRACKS, OR EXPOSED METAL ARE ON THE INSIDE SIDEWALL WHERE THE TIRE HAD STARTED TO BULGE. THANKFULLY, WE CAUGHT IT JUST IN TIME OR WE COULD HAVE BEEN IN A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT! SO DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS TIRE HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED AND THAT I'VE STILL HAD TO PAY FOR THE REPLACEMENT TIRES!!  *TR",
