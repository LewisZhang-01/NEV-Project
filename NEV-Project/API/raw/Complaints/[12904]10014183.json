THEREBY CAUSING THE STARTER TO FAIL AND ANTIFREEZE TO GET INTO THE ENGINE.  PONTIAC KNEW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND CORRECTED IT ON THE YEAR 2000 MODEL.  HOWEVER, THEY DID NOT DO A RECALL AND LEFT US POOR SAPS TO HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS OURSELVES.  SINCE MY CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY, THEY HAVE SAID THAT IT IS MY OWN PROBLEM.  I AM OUT OF POCKET $1,046.96 PLUS $40 TOWING FEE FOR A PROBLEM THEY KNEW ABOUT AND DIDN'T RECALL.  I WISH TO BE REIMBURSED.*JB",
