NORMALLY IT RETRACTS TO REAR POSITION AFTER DOOR CLOSES.  I TOOK MY CAR TO LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP AFTER THEY SAID OVER THE PHONE THAT SEAT BELT REPAIR WAS COVERED FOR LIFETIME OF VEHICLE.  THE DEALERSHIP HAD THE CAR FOR TWO DAYS THEN SAID I NEEDED A SEAT BELT CONTROL UNIT, NOT COVERED BY LIFETIME WARRANTY.  DEALER DID NOT FIX MALFUNCTIONING SEAT BELT.  I CALLED HONDA USA IN TORRENCE, CA.(1-800-999-1009), THEY ALSO SAID SEAT BELT CONTROL UNIT WAS NOT WARRANTED.  I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO OTHER THAN FIX PROBLEM AT MY OWN EXPENSE.  IS HONDA'S ASSUMPTION CORRECT IN STATING SEAT BELT CONTROL UNIT IS NOT PART OF THE SEAT BELT, THUS NOT COVERED UNDER LIFETIME WARRANTY? *TR",
