I NOTICED ABOUT A MONTH AGO MY CAR STARTED STALLING FOR A MOMENT WHEN I WOULD TRY TO ACCELERATE ON THE FREEWAY. AND NOW IT HAS RANDOMLY STARTED STALLING WHEN STOPPED AT A RED LIGHT. WHEN THIS HAPPENS I HAVE TO TURN THE CAR OFF AND TRY TO TURN IT BACK ON (USUALLY TAKES A COUPLE TIMES). THERE IS NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT THAT EVER COMES ON WHEN THIS HAPPENS. I LIVE ABOUT 33 MILES AWAY FROM MY WORK SO I DRIVE QUITE A BIT AND IT'S GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING IT. THERE IS NO CHECK LIGHT ENGINE ON EVER SO I CAN'T TAKE IT INTO A REPAIR SHOP.",
