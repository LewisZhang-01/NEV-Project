THE TIRES FAILED WITHIN 300 MILES OF EACH OTHER.  I CONTACTED FIRESTONE AND THEY SAID THE MOTOR HOME WAS OVERLOADED AND WE NEEDED TO HAVE THE MOTOR HOME WEIGHED.  THE SECOND TIRE FAILED WHEN THE MOTOR HOME WAS EMPTY.  IT WAS BEING TAKEN TO A DEALER FOR REPAIR.  THE FIRESTONE DEALER WILL NOT WARRANTY THE TIRES.  THEY GIVE THE TIRE FAILURE WAS DUE TO IMPROPER ALIGNMENT.  WE TOOK THE TIRES TO SEVERAL  INDEPENDENT DEALERS AND THEY ALL SAID IT WAS A MANUFACTURE PROBLEM NOT A MAINTENANCE OR OVERLOAD PROBLEM.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, WE WILL NOT BUY FIRESTONE TIRES.    *NLM",
