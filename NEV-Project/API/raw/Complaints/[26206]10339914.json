I WAS STUCK IN TRAFFIC AND NEAR MY MAZDA DEALER WHEN  THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT. UNABLE TO TURN STEERING WHEEL AT IDLE, BUT ABLE TO STEER AS THE CAR SPEEDS UP--BUT HAD TO PUT MUCH EFFORT INTO IT. I BOUGHT THE CAR BRAND NEW. I WAS UNAWARE OF ANY RECALLS FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM. CAR IS STILL IN THE SHOP FOR PART REPLACEMENT. DESPITE PART REPLACEMENT, I'M SURE THERE WILL BE MORE STEERING PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE. THIS IS MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.  *TR",
