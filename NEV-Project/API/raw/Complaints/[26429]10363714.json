RECALL 03V327 DID NOT APPLY TO MY VIN, AND A SPECIAL PROGRAM CHEVY IMPLEMENTED, DESCRIBED IN NHTSA ACTION # RQ04005 APPLIED TO MY CAR BUT EXPIRED IN FEBRUARY 2010.  UNDER THIS PROGRAM, GM REPLACED FAILED SWITCHES FOR FREE.  THEY REFUSE TO DO THIS FOR ME NOW, AS THE PROGRAM HAS EXPIRED.  THE RECALL DOESN'T EXPIRE, BUT THE PROGRAM DOES.  AS THIS ACKNOWLEDGED DEFECT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ISSUE OF THE RECALL, WHY IS THERE AN ALLOWED EXPIRATION FOR THE REMEDY??!  THIS MAKES NO SENSE, AND IS ADVERSE TO PUBLIC SAFETY!
