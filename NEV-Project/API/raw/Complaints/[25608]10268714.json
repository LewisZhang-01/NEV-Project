WHEN I HAD MY CAR IN FOR STATE INSPECTION IN MARCH 2008, THE DEALER(SATURN OF SYRACUSE) TOLD ME THE  PART WOULD BE REPLACED AS THEY HAD SEEN OTHER AURA'S WITH THE SAME PROBLEM AND THEY WERE ORDERING PARTS. WHEN I CHECKED BACK WITH THE DEALERSHIP, THEY SAID THAT GENERAL MOTORS DECIDED NOT TO PAY FOR A REPLACEMENT PART. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ALSO A PROBLEM ON OTHER GM CARS. *TR",
