        "summary": "ON JUNE 28, OUR 1999 HONDA ODYSSEY LX LOST ALL ELECTRICAL POWER AND ENGINE POWER WHILE TRAVELING ON I-94 E BOUND BETWEEN BATTLE CREEK MI AND THE EXIT TO I-69.  THE EMERGENCY FLASHERS WOULD NOT ACTIVATE.  WE WERE ABLE TO COAST TO A STOP ON THE SHOULDER, THEN AFTER PLACING THE CAR IN PARK AND SWITCHING OFF THE IGNITION, I WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE CAR.  IT RAN FINE FOR THE NEXT TWO HOURS, BUT THE SAME THING HAPPENED WHILE TRAVELING SOUTH ON I-75 NORTH OF DAYTON, OH.  THIS TIME, I NOTICED THE GAUGES CAME BACK ON AND WAS ABLE TO RESUME THE CRUISE CONTROL AND PROCEED WITH OUT STOPPING.  IN GOT CASE, TRAFFIC WAS NOT SO HEAVY AS TO BE A DANGER, AND LUCKILY WE WERE NOT IN THE PASSING LANE.  THE SAME FAILURE OCCURRED JUST BEFORE WE MADE IT ONTO OUR STREET, BUT FOR A SHORTER TIME AND WE CONTINUED HOME.  THE NEXT NIGHT, WHILE RETURNING HOME ON LOCAL STREETS, GOING ABOUT 35MPH, THIS FAILURE OCCURRED AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME, WE HAD THE HEADLIGHT ON (IT WAS ABOUT 9:15PM), AND WE LOST ALL LIGHTING (INTERIOR GAUGES AND EXTERIOR).    ON JUNE 30, THE DEALER WAS ABLE TO LOCATE THE PROBLEM - FAILED IGNITION SWITCH ELECTRICAL CONTACTS.      THE DEALER CLAIMS THIS CAR HAD BEEN SERVICED FOR THIS PROBLEM PREVIOUSLY AS A RESULT OF A RECALL.  I CHECKED YOUR ONLINE NOTICES:  MAY 16, 2002 NHTSA: 02V120000.  ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IGNITION SWITCH.      THIS RECALL NEEDS TO BE RE-ISSUED FOR THIS SAFETY RELATED PROBLEM.  WE WOULD HAVE HAD SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN BAD WEATHER; LOSS OF WINDSHIELD WIPERS AS WELL AS LIGHTING AND BRAKE LIGHTS.  AND AT NIGHT, IT COULD HAVE BEEN VERY BAD ON THE HIGHWAY.
