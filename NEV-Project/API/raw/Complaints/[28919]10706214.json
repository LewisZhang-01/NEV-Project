NOW WE ARE TOLD THAT THE CRADLE/SUBFRAME THAT HOLDS THE ENGINE IN IS RUSTED THROUGH CAUSING OUR VEHICLE PROBLEMS WHEN TURNING RIGHT. IT'S READY TO BREAK AND CAUSE MANY PROBLEMS IF WE CONTINUE DRIVING IT!!! I'VE FOUND MANY COMPLAINTS WITH BOTH OF THESE ISSUES ONLINE THAT PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED TO THE COMPANY. WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE TO GET A RECALL? A DEATH AS RESULT OF AN ACCIDENT CAUSED FROM DRIVING THE CAR. I HAVE KIDS...ITS UNSAFE AND COSTLY... WHAT A JUNK CAR CHRYSLER :(  *TR",
