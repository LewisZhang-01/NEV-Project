THE CAR IS VERY HARD TO DRIVE BECAUSE THE DASHBOARD IS WARPED AND IS SO HIGH UP IT IS HARD TO SEE OVER.  FORD IS A PIECE OF JUNK COMPANY AND WILL NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.  I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER FORD VEHICLE AGAIN.  THEY ARE A TERRIBLE COMPANY AND WILL NOT DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS OF THEIR CARS.  GEE,,,,I WONDER WHY THEY STOPPED MAKING THE CONTOUR?????  *JB",
