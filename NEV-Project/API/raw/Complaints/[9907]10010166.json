ON CHECKING WITH DEALER, THE ESTIMATED REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT OF WATER PUMP MAY COST AROUND $750. THIS IS AN UNUSUALLY HIGH COST FOR WATER PUMP REPLACEMENT. WITH THE CAR BEING A 96 MODEL HAVING ONLY A MILEAGE OF ABOUT 50 K, THIS KIND OF WATER PUMP FAILURE IS PROBABLY UNSEEN ON MOST OTHER CAR MODELS. THEREFORE, IT IS SUGGESTED TO THE MANUFACTURER TO INVESTIGATE INTO POSSIBLE DESIGN DEFECTS OF THE WATER PUMP.    *NLM",
