        "summary": "2004 FORD F-150 4.6L V8 REGULAR PICKUP TRUCK, 39,000 MILES ON ODOMETER - DRIVING 50 MPH AND THE TRUCK STARTS VIBRATING HORRIBLY LIKE DRIVING OVER A WASHBOARD ROAD.  NOTHING WILL CAUSE THE VIBRATION TO STOP, EVEN THROWING THE VEHICLE INTO NEUTRAL.  MUST STOP COMPLETELY, AND SOMETIMES PUT THE TRANSMISSION INTO REVERSE FOR A MOMENT, THEN PUT IT BACK INTO FORWARD DRIVE, TO MAKE THE PROBLEM GO AWAY.  THIS HAPPENS PERIODICALLY, ABOUT ONCE EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS.  SEARCH ON GOOGLE REVEALS HUNDREDS OF OTHERS COMPLAINING OF THE EXACT SAME THING WITH THEIR 2004 F-150 TRUCKS.  MOST CLAIM IT IS AN EXPENSIVE DIFFERENTIAL PROBLEM, AND CAUSED BY SOME TOOLING ERROR AT THE MANUFACTURING PLANT.  FORD HAS NOT INITIATED A RECALL, AND THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE AND DANGEROUS PROBLEM.  THE PROBLEM JUST HAPPENED AGAIN TODAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 2010, AND I NOW HAVE 43,000 MILES ON MY TRUCK.  IT'S USED FOR GETTING GROCERIES.  NO HEAVY USE, EVER.  ALSO, THE DOZENS OF COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER 2004 FORD F-150 OWNERS SAID THEIR TRUCKS ONLY HAD 35,000 TO 45,000 MILES ON THEM WHEN THE PROBLEM SURFACED. *TR",
