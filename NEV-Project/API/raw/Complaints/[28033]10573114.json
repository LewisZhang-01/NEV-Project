THE ENGINE LIGHT HAD COME ON.  THEY TOOK IT FOR A TEST DRIVE BUT DIDN'T MAKE IT VERY FAR BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T WORK FOR THEM EITHER.  THEY HAD TO PUSH THE CAR.  I BOUGHT THIS CAR IN 2009 WHEN IT WAS ONLY A YEAR OLD.  THEY TOLD ME THE TRANSMISSION WAS GONE.  I TRIED TO DRIVE IT HOME BUT ONLY GOT A FEW MILES WHEN I HAD TO PULL OVER AND HAVE IT TOWED.  THIS WAS AND IS VERY TROUBLING WITH ALL THE GM RECALLS.  THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM.  I STILL HAVE ANOTHER YEAR ON THE CAR AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIX IT.  I NEED HELP WITH THIS.  *TR",
