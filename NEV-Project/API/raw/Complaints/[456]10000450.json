I WAS TOLD IT WOULD COST ME 1100 DOLLARS TO FIX AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT THIS BEING THE SECOND REPAIR IN SUCH A SHORT TIME.    CUSTOMER CARE SAID ALL THEY COULD DO WAS OFFER A DISCOUNT ON A BRAND NEW VEHICLE. I THOUGHT THAT WAS LAUGHABLE. WILL THE REST OF THE PROBLEMS I'VE HAD I WILL NEVER TOUCH A GM PRODUCT AGAIN. 3 REPAIRS FIXED UNDER WARRANTY ARE NOW DOING THE SAME THING AGAIN AND NEED REPAIR. TS",
