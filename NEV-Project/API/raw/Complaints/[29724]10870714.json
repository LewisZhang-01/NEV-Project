        "summary": "LEFT FRONT HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY APPEARS FOGGED OVER ON THE INSIDE OF THE LENS.  DEALER INDICATES THAT THE DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHT (DRL) IN THIS ASSEMBLY HAS OVERHEATED.  THE INCREASED TEMPS CAUSED THE PLASTIC LENS TO APPEAR CLOUDY AND OR FOGGED OVER.  THE HIGHER TEMP HAS CHANGED THE SHAPE OF THE REFLECTOR OF THE DRL SOCKET TOO, CAUSING THE LEFT DRL TO APPEAR SIGNIFICANTLY DIMMER THAN THE OTHER SIDE DRL, ACCORDING TO THE DEALER.  WHEN DRIVING, THE FOGGED HEADLIGHT LENS DIMINISHES THE AMOUNT OF LIGHT EMITTED OUT OF THE FRONT OF THE CAR AND THE DIMINISHED BRIGHTNESS OF THE DRL IS OBVIOUS .  THIS CONDITION WAS NOTICED AFTER PURCHASE IN LATE 2014 BUT SEEMS TO HAVE INCREASED OVER TIME.  LAST WEEK IT OCCURRED TO ME TO ASK, DURING SCHEDULED DEALER SERVICE, ABOUT GETTING THE LENS CLEARED, THE DEALER POINTED OUT THE DEFECT IN THE OVERHEATED AND MISSHAPEN LENS ASSEMBLY IN THE DRL.  THE VEHICLE IS USED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO COMMUTE VIA INTERSTATE HIGHWAY BETWEEN HOME AND WORK.",
