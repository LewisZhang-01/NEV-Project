MY DAUGHTER'S CARSEAT WAS FOUND UNLATCHED ONE DAY.  MY HUSBAND AND I ALWAYS MAKE SURE THE CARSEAT IS IN CORRECTLY AND WE COULD ONLY GUESS THAT THE CARSEAT BECAME UNBELTED AFTER THE VAN WAS BEING VACUUMED OUT AT THE CARWASH.  THE EMPLOYEES AT THE CARWASH MUST HAVE BUMPED THE LATCH WITHOUT KNOWING AND THE BELT WAS RELEASED.  IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH OF A BUMP TO THE LATCH FOR IT TO RELEASE THE BELT.  BELTS SHOULD NOT RELEASE THAT EASILY.   *NLM",
