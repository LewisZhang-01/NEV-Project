GM HAS HAD A NATIONWIDE BACKORDER ON THE GASKED INVOLVED INDICATING REDESIGN DUE TO POOR INITIAL DESIGN. I HAD TO WAIT 4 MONTHS FOR THE GASKET TO BE DELIVERED AND THERE WERE 2 OTHER VENTURES IN THE REPAIR FACILITY UNABLE TO BE REPAIRED OR DRIVEN DUE TO THE BACKORDER.   MY COST FOR REPAIR WAS $538.  OTHERS HAVE HAD TO PAY OVER $4,000 DUE TO ENGINE FAILURE.  THIS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED AND GM MADE TO CONDUCT A NATIONWIDE RECALL/REIMBURSEMENT OF SAID REPAIR COSTS.  IF YOU DESIRE I WILL PROVIDE MY REPAIR INVOICE.  DUE TO THE PART FAILURE AND WAITING ON GASKET DELIVERY AND REPAIR, I MAY HAVE HIDDEN ENGINE DAMAGE THAT MAY SURFACE AT A LATER TIME.*JB",
