DEALER CLAIMS THAT IT IS FROM THE WINTER BLEND OF GAS, BUT MY OLD CAR NEVER HAD THIS SMELL AND NO ONE I KNOW THAT HAS A CAR HAS THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE SMELL IS SO BAD THAT PEOPLE GETTING OUT OF BACK DOORS WILL PLUG THEIR NOSES AND I MUST KEEP HEAT/AIR ON RECIRCULATE AND KEEP WINDOWS SHUT BECAUSE WHEN I STOP AT A LIGHT ETC..., THE SMELL GETS INTO THE CABIN.  IF DEALER CONTINUES TO \"NOT FIND A PROBLEM\" I WILL CONSIDER LEMON LAW LAWSUIT.",
