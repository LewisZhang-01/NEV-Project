        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING MY CAR FROM BURDINES HIALEAH PARKING LOT, THE STEERING WHEEL STARTED SMOKING AND I PULLED INTO THE FIRST PARKING SPOT THAT I SAW. I TURNED THE CAR OFF, BUT THE SMOKE CONTINUED TO INCREASE AND  FINALLY THE STEERING WHEEL CAUGHT ON FIRE. THE SECURITY GUARD IN THE PARKING LOT USED A FIRE EXTINGUISHER TO KILL THE FIRE AND THE HIALEAH FIRE DEPART. WAS ALSO CALLED AND CAME IN.   WHEN I CALLED MY MECHANIC REGARDING THIS ISSUE, HE TOLD ME  IT WAS WEIRD, BECAUSE HE NEVER HEARD OF A STEERING WHEEL CATCHING FIRE. I HAD THE CAR TOWED AT THE MECHANIC. ONCE I CAME HOME, I CHECKED THE INTERNET AND FOUND THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THE IGNITION. I CALLED FORD THE NEXT DAY AND REPORTED WHAT HAPPENED, THEY AGREED THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON MY VEHICLE. THEY TOLD ME NOT TO HAVE THE CAR FIXED UNTIL THEY TOOK A LOOK AT IT AND INVESTIGATE. IN THE MEANTIME, I HAD TO BORROW A CAR BECAUSE FORD REFUSED TO LEND ME A CAR TO GO TO WORK. IT TOOK THEM APPROXIMATELY 1 WEEK TO GET BACK TO ME AND THEY CALLED ME TO TELL ME THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE TO HAVE THE CAR FIX AS THEY HAD SENT VIA MAIL SOME RECALL NOTICES. I TOLD THEM THAT I NEVER RECEIVED THESE NOTICES AND THAT I MOVED TO FLORIDA 3 YEARS AGO AND NEVER GOT ANYTHING FROM THEM. I FURTHER EMPHASIZED THAT IF I DID GET THE NOTICE I WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY TAKEN MY CAR TO A FORD DEALER SINCE IT WOULD NOT HAVE COST ME A DIME. THEIR REPRESENTATIVE COULD NOT CARE LESS. SHE TOLD ME THAT FAR AS FORD IS CONCERNED THAT THE FIRE WAS MY FAULT AND THAT THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE AND WOULD NOT HELP/ASSIST WITH THE EXPENSIVE OF REPAIRING THE CAR. IN ANTICIPATION THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND AN AGENCY THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP ME RECUPERATE MY LOSSES, I RETAINED IN THE TRUNK OF THE CAR ALL THE  BURNED PARTS INCLUDING THE STEERING WHEEL IN OF THE OF CHANCE THAT I MAY FIND SOME HELP.   *JB",
