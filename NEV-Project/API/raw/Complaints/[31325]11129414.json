IF THE CAR HAS NOT BEEN USED FOR MORE THAN 30 MINS, MOSTLY LIKELY IT WILL TAKE 30 SECONDS FOR THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IMAGE TO SHOW UP ON THE SCREEN, RENDERING THE REAR VIEW CAMERA MOSTLY USELESS. WE HAVE MANY KIDS IN OUR AREA, THIS IS NOT SAFE. I CHECKED THE INTERNET, THERE ARE TONS OF COMPLAINS FROM OTHER DRIVERS ABOUT THIS RADIO FOR THIS ISSUE. VW IS DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT.     THIS RADIO NEEDS A FIRMWARE UPDATE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.",
