FROM THE START, I HAD PROBLEMS TIGHTENING THE STRAPS AROUND HIM, DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE IS NOT A SQUIRMER.  IT HAS BEEN VERY FRUSTRATING, AS I WAS PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THEY WERE NEVER TIGHT ENOUGH FOR PROPER PROTECTION.  I GOT THE SEAT SAFETY CHECKED AT THE AAA AT THE END OF FEB, AND THE ONLY \"MARK DOWN\" IN THE TESTING OF OUR INSTALLATION, WAS THAT THE STRAPS WERE NOT TIGHT ENOUGH FOR PROTECTION.  BUT, THE SAFETY CHECKER HERSELF WAS UNABLE TO GET THEM PROPERLY TIGHTENED.  I HAVE SEEN ON AN INTERNET CHAT BOARD THAT OTHERS ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM, SO I FEEL MORE CONFIDENT THAT THIS WASN'T JUST USER MISTAKE.  *JB",
