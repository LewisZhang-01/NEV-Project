I HAD A MORE AGGRESSIVE TIRSE PUT ON IN THE SPRING THINKING THIS WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM, IT DIDN'T. JEEP SAYS IT IS NORMAL FOR  THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE TO SLIDE WITHOUT ANTI LOCK BRAKES. THERE IS NO CONTROL WHEN YOUR HEADING FOR A TREE. WHEN I BOUGHT THIS JEEP, I WAS NOT MADE AWARE THAT IT WOULD SLIDE BECAUSE IT DIDNT HAVE ANTI LOCK BRAKES. WHY DID I PAY EXTRA FOR A LIMITED LIBERTY WITHOUT ANTILOCK BRAKES? MY DAUGHTERS AND MY SAFTEY ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN A CD AND CASSETTE PLAYER. UPGRADING  FROM A FRONT WHEEL DRIVE TO A 4 WHEEL DRIVE LIMITED LIBERTY IS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  *JB",
