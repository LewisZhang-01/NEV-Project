TOOK INTO DEALERSHIP AND MECHANIC WAS ABLE TO STICK HIS FINGERS THROUGH THE \"K\" FRAME AND NOTICED 3 GIANT HOLES IN THE FRAME FROM CORRODED METAL. UPON INVESTIGATION IT WAS NOTED THAT ON 5-19-14 THAT THE 2007 JEEP PATRIOT WAS RECALLED FOR THE EXACT SAME THING (23-012-14) DUE TO CORROSION OF THE K FRAME WHICH ENDED UP EXTENDING THE WARRANTY INDEFINITE. I CONTACTED CHRYSLER AND EXPLAINED MY FRUSTRATION WITH THE SITUATION AND ASKED THAT SINCE THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THE SAME EXACT SITUATION FOR THE 07 IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THEY COULD DO FOR ME. THEY PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO BECAUSE MY YEAR WAS NOT RECALLED EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THE SAME ISSUE. DUE TO THIS I WILL HAVE TO BUY A NEW VEHICLE ON SHORT NOTICE DUE TO THE SAFETY OF DRIVING MY FAMILY IN AN UNSAFE VEHICLE I BOUGHT BRAND NEW 6 YEARS AGO. I FEEL THAT CHRYSLER SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SOMETHING THEY DOCUMENTED AS A PROBLEM EVEN THOUGHT IT \"ONLY AFFECTED\" VEHICLES 2 YEARS PRIOR TO MINE INSTEAD OF JUST IGNORING THE CUSTOMER'S CONCERNS AND WORRIES. DUE TO THIS I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER CHRYSLER VEHICLE FOR THE WAY THE TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS.  *TR",
