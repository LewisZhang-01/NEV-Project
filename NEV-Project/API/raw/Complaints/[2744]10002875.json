I STUCK A PIECE OF WOOD SHIM BETWEEN THE PLUG-IN AND HOUSING AND THIS KEEPS THE IT FROM SHORTING OUT.   I WAS TOLD BY A LOCAL MECHANIC THAT THIS PROBLEM IS VERY VERY COMMON WITH THESE TRUCKS AND THAT IT IS A SHORT INSIDE THE LITTLE BOX WHERE THE PLUG PLUGS INTO.  I WAS DRIVING HOME PULLING A LARGE TRAILOR IN THE RAIN WHEN THE WIPERS JUST STOPPED WORKING AND ALMOST CRASHED INTO THE FREEWAY RAILING AND HAD TO STOP ON THE FREEWAY NEAR SEATTLE!  I DON'T FEEL I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR A DEFEC IN THE WIRING, WHEN MY OLD 1976 CHEVY TRUCK NEVER HAD A PROBLEM LIKE THAT!",
