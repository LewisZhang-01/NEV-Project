FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED  THE LEAK APPEARS TO BE COMING FROM NEAR THE TOP OF THE TANK.  I CAN'T SEE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK BECAUSE OF THE FRAME.  I CONTACTED DAIMLER-CHRYSLER AND THEY WERE NO HELP SINCE THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  SINCE THE LEAK IS NEAR THE EXHAUST PIPING, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF FIRE.  THE TRUCK HAD NEVER BEEN DRIVEN OFF-ROAD, ONLY ON STREETS AND HIGHWAYS.  I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT NEXT WEEK WITH A REPAIR FACILITY TO EXAMINE THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK.   *JB",
