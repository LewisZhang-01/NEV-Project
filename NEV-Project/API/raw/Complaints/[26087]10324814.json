        "summary": "I OWN A 2001 GMC SIERRA 1500 PICKUP TRUCK.  DURING EARLY MARCH OF THIS YEAR, MY BRAKES FAILED DUE TO RUST AND CORROSION ON THE BRAKE LINES.  TWO OF THE STEEL BRAKE LINES UNDER THE TRUCK WERE SO CORRODED WITH RUST THAT THE BRAKE FLUID RUPTURED THE LINES WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKES, AND POURED OUT ON THE GROUND. MY BRAKED PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR.  I HAD ZERO BRAKES WITHOUT WARNING.  IT WAS ONLY BY SHEER LUCK THAT I WAS TRAVELING VERY SLOWLY WHEN THIS OCCURRED, AND I WAS ABLE TO STOP USING THE EMERGENCY BRAKES.  I WAS IN THE TOWN OF RENOVO, AND COULD HAVE KILLED SOMEONE DUE TO THIS MISHAP.  WE LIVE ON A MOUNTAIN, AND TOW A TRAILER WITH HORSES.  THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A COMPLETE DISASTER UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES.  THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING THAT THE BRAKES WOULD SOON COMPLETELY FAIL.      IT COST OVER ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REPLACE ALL OF THE BRAKE LINES ON OUR TRUCK.  I HAVE THE RECEIPT.  *TR",
