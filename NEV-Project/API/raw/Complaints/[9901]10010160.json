        "summary": "I OWN A 1996 DODGE RAM 1500 WITH THE 5.2 LITER ENGINE.  THE ENGINE OIL LIGHT WOULD FLICKER WHEN STOPPED AT A STOP SIGN IN DRIVE.  I TOOK IT TO THE DODGE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THAT THE ENGINE WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED DUE TO THE WEAR.  I HAVE USED MOBILE 1 SYNTHETIC OIL SINCE THE BREAKIN OIL AND NEVER LET THE OIL IN THE VEHICLE OVER 4,000 MILES.  EACH TIME THE OIL FILTER WAS ALSO CHANGED.  THE VEHICLE HAS 106,000 MILES ON IT AND THE ENGINE REPLACEMENT IS COSTING ME $4.700.  I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THE 5.2 LITER ENGINE DOES NOT HANDLE SYNTHETIC OIL WELL.  THE OIL DOES NOT RETURN TO THE OIL PAN FAST ENOUGH TO KEEP THE BOTTOM OF THE ENGINE LUBRICATED.  I FIND THIS HARD TO BELIEVE BUT I'VE NEVER WORE OUT AN ENGINE BEFORE.  MY QUESTION IS HOW CAN AN ENGINE WEAR OUT WHEN IT WAS TAKEN SUCH GOOD CARE OF?  I'VE HAD SEVERAL OTHER FAILURES OF THIS VEHICLE DEALING WITH U-JOINTS, STEERING SHAFT, FAILED FUEL PUMP, AND AN UNSTABLE SUSPENSION REQUIRING A $500 PISTON ASSEMBLY TO REPAIR BUT THE REPAIR DID NOTHING TO HELP.  *NLM",
