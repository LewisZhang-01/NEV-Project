        "summary": "FUEL LIFT PUMP LOSES PRESSURE OVER TIME CAUSING INTEGRATED CIRCUIT IN FUEL SYSTEM TO FAIL TO FUNCTION. DRIVER OF VEHICLE RECEIVES A WARNING LIGHT ON DASH,; THE ENGINE COMPUTER SOMETIMES DE-RATES THE ENGINE AND SOMETIMES SHUTS OFF THE ENGINE.   THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ONE PARTICULAR BUS THAT SHUT OFF WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD ON A ROUTE. BUS TAKEN TO AUTHORIZED DEALERSHIP. IF THE DEALERSHIP CAN RESET THE CODE AND IT DOESN'T FAULT, THE VEHICLE IS RETURNED TO US CLAIMING NO PROBLEMS EXIST. THE  BUS THEN DIES OUT AGAIN. LIFT PUMP MALFUNCTION ALSO DAMAGES INJECTOR PUMP. SHORTLY AFTER HAVING THE LIFT PUMP REPLACED, THE BUS IS DOWN AGAIN FOR AN INJECTOR PUMP.  AT LEAST 3 OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE ALSO REPORTED SIMILAR TYPE INCIDENTS. WE HAVE A TOTAL OF 36 UNITS POWERED BY THE CUMMINS ISB225 ENGINE. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS WILL CONTINUE OVER TIME AND THAT THE MANUFACTURER IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, BUT SELDOM DOES IT GET ADDRESSED WITH THE FIRST TRIP TO THE AUTHORIZED DEALER. BUSES THAT DON'T HAVE EXTENDED WARRANTY COVERAGE WILL BEGIN TO SEE MORE EXPENSIVE BILLS FOR REPAIR. *JB",
