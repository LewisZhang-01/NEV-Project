HOWEVER, I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE RECALL NOTICE UNTIL AFTER I MADE A LONG TRIP WITH MY SISTER FROM ATLANTA, GA TO MELBOURNE, FL IN MID JUNE 2016. FORTUNATELY MY SISTER AND I WERE NOT IN AN ACCIDENT DURING THAT TRIP, BUT IF I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THE RECALL BEFOREHAND, I WOULD NOT HAVE USED THE CAR FOR THE TRIP. LEXUS NEEDS TO DO A BETTER JOB OF NOTIFYING THEIR CUSTOMERS OF SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT COULD RESULT IN MAJOR INJURY OR DEATH. I AM ANGRY THAT MY HUSBAND AND I CANNOT MAKE FULL USE OF THIS CAR AND THAT LEXUS IS NOT FIXING THIS PROBLEM...THEY TOLD US TO WAIT ANOTHER 6 MONTHS. WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO CONTINUE MAKING CAR PAYMENTS ON A VEHICLE THAT IS DEFECTIVE AND DANGEROUS. SHAME ON THE CAR MANUFACTURERS LEXUS (TOYOTA) AND MANY OTHERS WHO KNEW THAT TAKATA AIR BAGS WERE DEFECTIVE AND YET STILL INSTALLED THEM IN THEIR CARS IN THE NAME OF SAVING DOLLARS. DISGUSTING!",
