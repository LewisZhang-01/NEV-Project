        "summary": "I WAS MAKING A SLOW 90 DEGREE TURN TO THE RIGHT ONTO A DRIVEWAY  WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY 12\" LOWER THAN THE ROAD I WAS ON. AS MY RIGHT WHEEL DROPPED OFF ONTO THE DRIVEWAY, WE HEARD A SHARP CRACKING NOISE. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, I NOTICED THAT THE STEERING WAS STIFF WHEN TURNING TO THE RIGHT.  IT WAS THE NEXT DAY , SUNDAY WHEN AS I TURNED TO THE RIGHT, WE LOST ALL OUR POWER STEERING FLUID WITH A  GUSH AS THE POWER STEERING PUMP BLEW ITS FRONT MAIN SEAL DUE TO OVER PRESSURING FROM THE BROKEN RACK AND PINION. THE RACK AND PINION MAIN SHAFT WAS COMPLETELY SEVERED, IT ACTUALLY TORE OFF ITS WELDED BRACKET ON ONE SIDE AND THE HYDRAULIC CYLINDER WHICH WAS A COMPONET OF THE SYSTEM, BOUND UP AND BLEW OUT BOTH SEALS. THE MECHANIC INDICATED THAT THIS LEAD TO THE OVER PRESSURE OF THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM WHICH RESULTED IN THE PUMP BLOWING ITS MAIN SEAL. HE ALSO SAID HE FELT THE DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM )IE NOT HAVING BOTH SIDES OF THE RACK AND PINION IN HARD MOUNTS) WAS AT LEAST A  PARTIAL CAUSE. ADDITIONALLY, THE MECHANIC INDICATED THAT THE RE-BUILDER TO WHOM THIS WAS TO BE SENT HAD SEEN ABOUT 10 OTHERS LIKE THIS PREVIOUSLY. HAD A TOTAL COST OF REPAIR WAS ALMOST $1,000.00. *JB    ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*****734343",
