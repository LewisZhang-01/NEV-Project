I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO TWO DIFFERENT DEALERS FOR SERVICE. ON ONE OCCASION IT WAS FOUND THAT THE VEHICLE HAD VERY LITTLE OIL. THIS WAS ONLY ONE WEEK AFTER AN OIL CHANGE WAS PERFORMED. NO OIL LEAK WAS FOUND. IN SUBSEQUENT WEEKS THE GAUGES STARTING DROPPING TO ZERO AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WOULD COME ON. TOOK TO ANOTHER DEALER AND SEVERAL PARTS WERE REPLACED INCLUDING THE WATER PUMP, THERMOSTAT, ETC. I AM STILL NOT CONVINCED THAT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN SOLVED, ESPECIALLY AFTER READING THE COMPLAINTS ON THIS WEBSITE. I WOULD LIKE THIS TO BE RESOLVED PRIOR TO MY ENGINE BLOWING LIKE MANY OF THE OTHERS THAT I'VE SEEN ON THIS COMPLAINT DATABASE.   *NLM",
