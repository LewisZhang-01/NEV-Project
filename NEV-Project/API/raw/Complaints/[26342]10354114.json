        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING MY 2006 DODGE RAM 3500 5.9 CUMMINS TURBO DIESEL PICKUP AT APPROXIMATELY 60 M. P.H. WHEN I STARTED SMELLING DIESEL FUEL FUMES.  I LOOKED IN MY OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS AND COULD SEE WHAT APPEARED TO BE A MIST SPRAYING BEHIND THE VEHICLE.  I BEGAN TO LOOK FOR A SAFE PLACE TO PULL OFF THE ROAD AS I WAS PULLING A TRAILER BEHIND ME.  JUST BEFORE I PULLED OFF THE ROAD, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.   WHEN I STOPPED, I COULD SEE A MIST COMING FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  I OPENED THE HOOD AND NOTICED THERE WAS DIESEL FUEL SPRAYED UNDER THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND ALSO UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE.  THERE WAS FUEL DRIPPING FROM UNDERNEATH THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT WHERE IT SPRAYED HEAVILY.  UPON LOOKING FURTHER, I NOTICED THERE WAS A BROKEN FUEL LINE THAT CAUSED RAW FUEL TO BE SPRAYED IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT INCLUDING DIRECTLY ONTO THE ENGINE AND UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE ONTO THE EXHAUST SYSTEM.  IT APPEARS THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM AND IS USUALLY THE #4 FUEL LINE.  I FEEL THIS IS A FIRE HAZARD AND COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS TO THE DRIVER AND/OR PASSENGERS AND OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. *TR",
