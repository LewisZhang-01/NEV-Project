        "summary": "I HAVE A  SAFETY CONCERN WITH MY 2001 TOYOTA CAMRY PURCHASED THROUGH IRA TOYOTA IN DANVERS MASS.  THE TIRES PULLED TO RHE LEFT AND  SQUEALED GOING AROUND CORNERS.  I KEPT CHECKING TIRE PRESSURE TO SEE IF THAT WAS THE CAUSE, NO.   IN OCTOBER I TOOK THE CAR IN TO HAVE THE TIRES ROTATED AT DUBE TOYOTA IN DOVER, NH. THE CAR HAD A LITTLE OVER 19,000 MILES ON IT.  I WAS ASKED INTO THE SERVICE AREA TO LOOK AT THE TIRES BECAUSE THEY WERE VERY WORN. THE FRONT TIRES WERE VERY WORN ON BOTH THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE EDGES, THE  CORDING WAS VISIBLE.  THE REAR TIRES WERE WORN EVENLY. STARTED THE COMPLAINT PROCESS WITH IRA TOYOTA. THE SERVICE MANAGER AT BILL DUBE TALKED WITH THE DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVE ABOUT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IN REPLACING THE TIRES. I REPLACED THE FRONT TIRES  IMMEDIATELY. HAD ALIGNMENT CHECKED. CALLED TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SPOKE WITH CHRISTINA WOODS WHO INITIATED MY CLAIM/COMPLAINT  I CALLED AGAIN AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND SPOKE TO ANOTHER PERSON, WAS TOLD TO SEND IN ALL MY WORK ORDERS/PAID RECEIPTS AND THEY WOULD REIMBURSE US FOR FOUR NEW TIRES AND THE WHEEL ALIGNMENT.  I HAD THE REAR TIRES REPLACED.  DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVE SAID  HE COULD REIMBURSE US FOR TWO TIRES.  WHEN HE WAS INFORMED THAT TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID THEY WOULD PAY FOR ALL FOUR HE APPARENTLY BECAME LIVID, CALLED TOYOTA TO COMPLAIN BECAUSE THEY HAD USURPED HIS AUTHORITY. NEITHER PARTY WILL NOW REIMBURSE US FOR ANY TIRES.    MY CONCERN AT THIS TIME IS THE SAFETY ISSUE.  DURING MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH TOYOTA AND THE DEALER THEY TOLD ME THAT THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE WITH CAMRYS.  THE TIRES ARE MANUFACTURED WITH VERY SOFT SIDEWALLS (REASON FOR THE SQUEALING) TO IMPROVE RIDE.  THE SIDEWALLS COLLAPSE ON CORNERS CAUSING EXCESSIVE WEAR, ESPECIALLY ON THE EDGES.  IF THEY ARE NOW USING INFERIOR TIRES WHERE ELSE HAVE THEY CUT CORNERS OR USED INFERIOR MATERIAL THAT MIGHT WELL AFFECT THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE. TRYING TO WARN EVERYONE I CAN ABOUT THE POTENTIAL SAFETY PROBLEMS.",
