I HAVE CALLED DEALERSHIPS TO GET THIS PROBLEM REPAIRED BUT HAVE JUST BEEN LAUGHED AT AND BEEN TOLD THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM DUE TO WEAR AND TEAR.  I DON'T BELIEVE THIS TO BE SO, BECAUSE I HAVE PURCHASED TOYOTA VEHICLES IN THE PAST AND HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH POOR CRAFTSMANSHIP  BEFORE.  THIS INCIDENT MAY DETER ME FROM BUYING ANOTHER TOYOTA VEHICLE IN THE FUTURE.  CURRENTLY, I AM IN THE MARKET FOR ANOTHER VEHICLE.",
