        "summary": "I HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE FOR FOURTEEN MONTHS.  AS I WAS PARKING IN FRONT OM APARTMENT, MY RIGHT FRONT TIRE BUMPED THE CURVE AND TRIGGERED MY AIR BAGS, WHICH IN TURN EXPLODED AND CAUSED $3,000 IN DAMAGE.  THE FORD CERTIFIED DEALER IN MY AREA WAS UNABLE TO FIND A REASON FOR THE AIRBAGS TO GO OFF.  AND WHEN I CALLED FORD THE LADY ON THE PHONE TOLD ME THAT SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING.  SHE SAID SHE HAD HEARD OF PEOPLE COMPLAINING THAT THE AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY WHEN THEY FELT IT SHOULD, BUT NOT THE AIRBAG DEPLOYING FROM A <1MPH IMPACT OF A TIRE INTO A CURB.  FORD INSISTED THEY COULD NOT HELP ME.  THIS HAS REALLY BEEN HARD ON ME CONSIDERING MY INSURANCE COMPANY WAS HESITANT TO COVER THE INCIDENT BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THEM NO COLLISION OCCURED FOR THE AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY.  HOWEVER, MY INSURANCE COMPANY FINALLY ACCEPTED CLAIM.  ALTHOUGH IN RETURN MY RATES HAVE WENT UP AND I HAD TO TAKE A LOAN OF $500 TO COVER THE DEDUCTIBLE.  EVERYONE I HAVE TALKED TO HAS BEEN RESISTANT TO HELP ME.  IS THERE ANYTHING YOU OR I CAN DO TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE WITH FORD?  THIS INCIDENT I MUST NOTE IS NOT THE ONLY MAJOR ISSUE WITH THIS VEHICLE.  IT IS A 1999 FORD TAURUS 92,000 MILES.",
