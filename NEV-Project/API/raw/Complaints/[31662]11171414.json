ABOUT 2 HRS INTO THE TRIP, SOMEONE CUT IN FRONT OF ME , AND I ATTEMPTED TO SOUND THE HORN, HOWEVER IT APPEARED IT HAD FROZEN UP, AND BARELY WORKED. ALONG WITH A HORRIBLE EXHAUST VIBRATION DURING THE LAST 3 HOURS OF MY 6 HOUR TRIP.  IT APPEARS THAT HONDA ISN'T READY FOR WINTER AS THRY CLAIM WITH THEIR CRV AD AT THIER WINTER TESTING FACITLY.... THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE NOT HAVING A WARNING DEVICE DURING A SNOW STORM, ALONG WITH THE ACCUMULATION OF SNOW STICKING UNDER THE VEHICLE CAUSING A TERRIBLE EXHAUST NOISE.",
