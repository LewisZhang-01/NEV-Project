SINCE MY VAN CONTAINS YOUR DEFECTIVE GEN 3 SEATBELTS, WHAT GOOD IS IT GOING TO DO IF THE CAR SEAT IS INSTALLED PROPERLY?  CAN YOU GUARANTEE, IN WRITING, YOUR SEATBELT WILL NOT OPEN AND MY GRANDSON OR OTHER REAR SEAT PASSENGERS WILL NOT BE INJURED OR KILLED?  LUCKILY, THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY INCIDENTS.  DOES THE PUBLIC HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THERE ARE \"ENOUGH\" DEATHS FOR YOU TO TAKE CARE OF THIS PROBLEM?",
