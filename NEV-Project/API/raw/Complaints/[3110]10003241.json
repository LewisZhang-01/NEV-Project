THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION BEGAN UPSHIFTING AND DOWNSHIFTING BY ITSELF, CAUSING THE ENGINE TO REDLINE AND NEARLY STRANDING OUR VEHICLE IN THE LANE WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC. THE TRANSMISSION THEN LOCKED THE WHEELS, RENDERING THE CAR IMMOBILE. THIS OCCURRED ON 01/20/03.  ONE MONTH PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT I REPORTED TO VW THAT I WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH MY TRANSMISSION NOT SHIFTING INTO REVERSE FROM PARK-THIS OCCURRED TWICE ON THE SAME DAY. ON 12/19/03 VW INSPECTED MY TRANSMISSION.  A WRITTEN REPORT FROM VW SERVICE WAS GIVEN TO ME THEY FOUND NO PROBLEMS.  CURRENTLY VW IS REPLACING MY TRANSMISSION, THEYRE NOT ADMITTING THE POSSIBILITY OF ENGINE DAMAGE. THE SERVICE MANAGER CAREL TOLD ME,1/21/03,THAT THEY HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING IF THE NEW REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION MIGHT FAIL LIKE THE FIRST. MY CONCERN IS THAT I MIGHT NOT BE AS LUCKY NEXT TIME. I COULD BE REAR ENDED OR HIT HEAD-ON IF MY WHEELS LOCK UP AGAIN SPONTANEOUSLY.",
