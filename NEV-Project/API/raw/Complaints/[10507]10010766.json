THIS JOB COST ME $777.00 TO HAVE CORRECTED. I HAD OWNED THE VAN FOR LESS THAN ONE YEAR WHEN THESE PROBLEMS OCCURRED. THE VAN HAD 55,133 MILES ON IT AT THE TIME.  THE FUNNY THING IS A FEW DAYS AFTER I PURCHASED MY VAN MY MOM PURCHASED ONE ALSO.  ABOUT 2 MONTHS AFTER SHE HAD HERS THE SAME PROBLEM HAPPENED AND SHE HAD TO HAVE HER INTAKE GASKET REPLACED ALSO.  APPARENTLY THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THESE GASKETS AND GM SHOULD REPLACE THEM.  OR AT LEAST REIMBURSE US FOR THIS MONEY WE HAD TO FORK OUT FOR A PROBLEM THAT IS APPARENTLY A LITTLE MORE THAN A COINCIDENCE.   *NLM",
