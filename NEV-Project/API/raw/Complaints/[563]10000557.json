EVERY TIME CAR IS PUT INTO DRIVE, IT DEFAULTS TO 'OVERDRIVE' MODE - WHICH MEANS IT IS FREE WHEELING WHENEVER DRIVER'S FOOT COMES OFF THE ACCELERATOR.  NO ENGINE BRAKING!!  TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE GAS AND THE CAR ROLLS FREELY.  THIS IS GROSSLY UNSAFE, PARTICULARLY IN TOWN DRIVING.  TO GET ENGINE BRAKING, DRIVER MUST PUSH A BUTTON.  THE DEFAULT SHOULD BE THE OTHER WAY AROUND:  CAR SHOULD BE DESIGNED SO IT AUTOMATICALLY PROVIDES REGULAR, SAFER ENGINE BRAKING MODE, AND THE DRIVER SHOULD HAVE TO PUSH A BUTTON TO GET INTO LESS SAFE, ECONOMY OVERDRIVE MODE.  A COMPUTER CHIP RECALL WOULD PROBABLY CORRECT THIS.    PLEASE INVESTIGATE!!!!!!!!",
