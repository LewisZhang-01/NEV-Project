SINCE THE PURCHASE THERE HAS BEEN A POPPING AND RATCHETING SOUND COMING FROM THE REAR END.  THE DIFFERENTIAL UNIT WAS IMPROPERLY OPERATING.  TRIED FOR 22,000 MILES TO GET THE DEALER TO REPLACE THE DIFFERENTIAL UNIT BUT WAS TOLD SEVERAL TIMES THAT THE UNIT WAS FINE AND THE NOISE WAS TO BE EXPECTED.  WHEN THE TRUCK REACHED 40,000 MILE THE DIFFERENTIAL BECAME COMPLETELY INOPERABLE. JUST OVER 27,000 MILES LATER THE DIFFERENTIAL EXPLODED DESTROYING THE ENTIRE INTERNAL AXLE ASSEMBLY.  THE DEALER STILL REFUSES TO HELP.  THE DEALER REFUSED TO FIX THE PROBLEM FOR THE ORIGNAL OWNER AND IS STILL REFUSING TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE CONTACTED CHEVROLET CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY ARE TRYING TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM.  I REALLY DID NOT APPRECIATE THE WAY THE DEALER HAS TREATED ME THIS ENTIRE TIME.  THEY TREATED ME LIKE I WAS SOME DUM PUNK KID THAT JUST WALKED IN OFF THE STREET.  I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TREATED THIS WAY NOR SHOULD I OR ANYONE ELSE HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THIS KIND OF SERVICE.",
