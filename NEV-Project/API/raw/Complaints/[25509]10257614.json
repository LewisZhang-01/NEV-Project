THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHILE DRIVING THAT I GET VERY DIZZY. AFTER RESEARCHING I FOUND THERE A QUITE A FEW COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS VERY PROBLEM. IT SEEMS ALONG WITH THE SULFUR DIOXIDE THERE IS CARBON MONOXIDE INSIDE THE CABIN, REGARDLESS IF THE WINDOWS ARE UP OR DOWN. TOYOTA'S RESPONSE IS THAT THIS IS DUE TO BAD GAS. I LIKE MY 4RUNNER BUT THERE IS NO WAY I CAN DRIVE IT KNOWING THAT NOT ONLY ME, BUT MY SON ALSO ARE BEING POISONED. TOYOTA MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND FIX THIS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE SOMEONE GETS SERIOUSLY HURT!!!! *TR",
