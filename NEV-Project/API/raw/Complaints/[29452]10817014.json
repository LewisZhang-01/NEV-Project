A BIG EFFORT FROM AN ADULT CAN OPEN AND CLOSE, BUT NOT POSSIBLE FROM ANY OF  OUR SIX CHILDREN RIDING IN THE BACK. THE DRIVER SLIDING DOOR IS BLOCKED BY A REAR FACING BABY SEAT, SO THERE IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN.   THIS ISSUE STARTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY. THERE WERE NO ISSUES PRIOR TO THIS.   *JS",
