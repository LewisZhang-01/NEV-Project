I HAD IT TOWED TO A REPAIR SHOP AND CALLED CHRYSLER WHO INFORMED ME THE WARRANTY EXPIRED, BUT WITH A FAIRY NEW CAR, I FEEL THE ENGINE SHOULD NOT HAVE WENT. THE ONLY WAY THEY WILL TALK TO ME ABOUT IT IS IF I TAKE IT TO A DEALERSHIP AT MY EXPENSE AND HAVE IT LOOKED AT. THIS IS AT A COST OF $500.00 AND THEY TOLD ME CHRYSLER MOST LIKELY WILL NOT PAY AND THAT I WOULD BE OUT THE MONEY AND HAVE A BASKET FULL OF PARTS. I FEEL THE COMPANY SHOULD STAND BY THEIR PRODUCTS AND TAKE SOME CONSIDERATION OF THE CUSTOMER. AS I STATED TO THEM :THEY HAVE MY $22,000.00 AND I HAVE NO WORKING CAR TO SHOW FOR IT.  THIS CAR STOPPED AT A BUSY INTERSECTION PUTTING MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS DRIVING IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY.   *NLM",
