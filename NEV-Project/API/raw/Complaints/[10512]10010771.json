I QUESTIONED THE FORD DEALER WHO MADE THE REPAIRS AS TO HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN. THEY STATED THAT THEY HAD NEVER SEEN THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM BEFORE. SINCE THEN I WITNESSED ANOTHER FORD VEHICLE ENCOUNTER THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. DUE TO LARGE AMOUNT OF EXPLORERS, EXPEDITIONS AND F150'S ON THE ROAD TODAY, THIS WAS VERY CONCERNING TO ME. FORTUNATELY IN BOTH CASES WE WERE TRAVELING AT A VERY LOW RATE OF SPEED AND WAS ABLE TO COME TO A STOP WITHOUT INCIDENT. I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE NEW AND NEVER HAD WORK DONE ON THE STEERING PREVIOUS TO THIS PROBLEM.    *NLM",
