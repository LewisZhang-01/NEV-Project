        "summary": "I CURRENTLY OWN TWO DODGE STRATUS' A 1997 AND 1999. MY 1997 STRATUS BEGAN OVER HEATING IN JANUARY AND I HAD SEVERAL ITEMS REPLACED TO INCLUDE THE THERMOSTAT, AND RADIATOR. THE VEHICLE CONTINUED TO OVER HEAT UNTIL IT FINALLY BLEW THE HEAD GASKET TO THE TUNE OF 700.00 DOLLARS OR MORE (CURRENTLY IN THE SHOP). MY 1999 STRATUS HAS NOW BEGAN TO OVER HEAT ON A REGULAR BASIS. I HAVE HAD THE COOLANT SYSTEM FLUSHED AND THE THERMOSTAT REPLACED, BUT IT CONTINUES TO OVER HEAT. MY MECHANIC HAS EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THE HEAD GASKET IS A COMMON PROBLEM AND HAS SUGGESTED THAT I HAVE MY 1999 STRATUS HEAD GASKET REPLACED WITH A SIMILAR COST OF 700.00 DOLLARS. I MIGHT BELIEVE THAT IF ONLY ONE VEHICLE HAD THIS PROBLEM, IT WAS NOT A MANUFACTURING PROBLEM, BUT NOW A SECOND VEHICLE HAS THE SAME PROBLEM AND ITS NOT EVEN THE SAME YEAR VEHICLE SO THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD DO A RECALL.*JB",
