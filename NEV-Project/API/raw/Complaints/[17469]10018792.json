        "summary": "I HAVE OWNED A VW PASSAT V6 4MOTION SINCE MARCH OF 2002.  THERE HAVE BEEN MANY MINOR DEFECTS INCLUDING ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS AND PAINT.  THE ONE DEFECT OF IMPORTANCE IS A THROTTLE DELAY.  WHEN DEPRESSING THE ACCELERATOR, THERE IS A DELAY IN RESPONSE, ESPECIALLY WHILE MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN. THIS PROBLEM HAS DEVELOPED OVER TIME AND WORSENED AND NOW THE STEERING ALSO WHINES WHEN MAKING LEFT TURNS.  IT FEELS LIKE THE PEDAL IS HARD TO PUSH, BUT THEN THE CAR SUDDENLY ACCELERATES..  AT \"MID RANGE,\" THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH THE THROTTLE.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS ATTEMPTED TO REMEDY THE THROTTLE PROBLEM.  THERE WAS SOME IMPROVEMENT AFTER REPLACING THE THROTTLE BODY ASSEMBLY IN 1/03, BUT THE PROBLEM HAS WORSENED AGAIN. DURING A TEST DRIVE IN 4/03 THE SERVICE MANAGER ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROBLEM, STATING THAT IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.  LAST WORD FROM THE DEALERSHIP WAS THE PASSAT NATURALLY HAS A THROTTLE DELAY- IN OTHER WORDS THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  4/03, I SENT PAPERWORK INITIATING A LEMON LAW BUY BACK.   *NLM",
