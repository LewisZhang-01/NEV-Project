        "summary": "PONTIAC GRAND AM 2000 STALLS OUT WHILE DRIVING WITHOUT ANY WARNING, I DON'T EVEN DRIVE THE CAR ON MAJOR HIGHWAYS ANYMORE, ONLY DRIVE ON THE BACK ROADS. THE LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED I WAS LUCKY BUT THIS HAS HAPPENED TOO MANY TIMES, 5 IN ALL AND I AM AFRAID THE NEXT TIME I WON'T BE SO LUCKY AND I WILL HURT NOT ONLY MYSELF BUT ANYONE WHO HAPPENS TO BE BEHIND ME WHEN IT CUTS OUT AT 60 OR 65 MILES AN HOUR. IT WAS ALSO HARD TO START THE CAR AT TIMES AND THE WEATHER HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT, AND IT DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER, HOT, COLD , MUGGY, RAINY, COLD OR DAMP THE COOLANT LIGHT HAD BEEN COMING ON INTERMITTENTLY AND 3 DAYS AFTER I HAD IT IN FOR SERVICE THE CAR STALLED OUT AGAIN AND THE COOLANT LIGHT CAME ON AND STAYED ON, I WAS IN A PARKING LOT SO I WAS SAFE. MY HUSBAND CAME AND FOUND RED GOOEY STUFF IN THE COOLANT RESERVOIR TANK. TOOK BACK IN FOR REPAIRS AND THEY SUPPOSEDLY FIXED A LEAK AND CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS ONE, PUT THE SAME RED STUFF RIGHT BACK IN, DEX-COOL, SO THE PROBLEM IS NOT FIXED. I ALSO FEEL THEY SHOULD HAVE FLUSHED THE SYSTEM SINCE I AM SURE IT WENT ALL THROUGH THE SYSTEM, BUT I  AM JUST A WOMAN AND WHAT COULD I KNOW?? THE SERVICE DEPT. ALSO REWORDED EVERY REPAIR I ASKED THEM TO DO, SUCH AS IF I SAID TIRES WERE WEARING UNEVENLY, THEY WORDED IT, CUSTOMER STATES TIRES LOSING PSI. I HAVE ALL OF MY REPAIR ORDERS AND THE LAST ONE I MADE A COPY OF SINCE I SENT IT TO PONTIAC, I HAVE PROOF THIS TIME IN WRITING OF MY WORDING.  THIS GRAND AM HAS 19,967 MILES ON IT AND IS 3 YEARS OLD, THIS TELLS YOU JUST HOW OFTEN IT IS DRIVEN.  IT IS TOO DANGEROUS TO DRIVE ANY WHERE BUT ON BACK STREETS. *JB",
