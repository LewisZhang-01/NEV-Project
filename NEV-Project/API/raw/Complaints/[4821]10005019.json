WHEN WE TOOK OFF THE FUEL PUMP, WHICH IS LOCATED INSIDE THE GAS TANK, THE WIRES HAD SHORTED OUT AND WERE BURNED.  THIS SEEMS DANGEROUS AND I FEEL IT COULD HAVE STARTED A FIRE OR CAUSED AN EXPLOSION.  I CHECKED OTHER COMPLAINTS AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE THIS HAS HAPPENED TO.  PLEASE MAKE THE MANUFACTURER CHECK THIS PART AND MAKE SURE IT IS SAFE AND THAT THIS WILL NOT RESULT IN A FIRE FOR SOMEONE ELSE!!",
