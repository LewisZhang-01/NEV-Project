I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER AND THE FRONT ROTORS AND PADS WERE REPLACED UNDER THE WARRANTY.  AT 27,000 MILES (NOV. 2002) THE PROBLEM RETURNED . THIS TIME THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED.  THE DEALER SAID THEY WOULD PROVIDE THE PARTS AT NO CHARGE BUT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE LABOR TO REPLACE THE ROTORS.  THE DEALER ASSURED ME THAT THIS WOULD BE THE LONG TERM SOLUTION TO THE BRAKE/SHUDDER PROBLEM.  YESTERDAY, SEVEN MONTHS AND 5,000 MILES LATER IT TOOK THE CAR BACK IN FOR THE SAME BRAKING PROBLEM. THIS TIME, I HAVE TO PAY FOR THE LABOR TO HAVE THE CALIPERS REPLACED AND WARPED ROTORS.   I AM FINDING THAT THIS BRAKE PROBLEM WITH JEEP GRAND CHEROKEES IS NOT ISOLATED TO MY CAR.  THE DEALER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THERE ARE \"PROBLEMS\" WITH THE BRAKES FOR THIS YEAR AND MODEL.  CHRYSLER/JEEP SHOULD BE FORCED TO RECALL THE 1999 GRAND CHEROKEES AND PERMANENTLY FIX THIS FLAWED BRAKING SYSTEM.  *JB",
