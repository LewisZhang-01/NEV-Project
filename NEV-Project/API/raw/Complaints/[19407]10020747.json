        "summary": "THE ABS CONTROL MODULE ON THE 1999 CHEVROLET SILVERADO HAS BEEN GOING BAD PREMATURELY.  A GREAT NUMBER OF THESE TRUCKS ARE HAVING THIS UNIT'S MOTOR RUN CONTINUOSLY, CAUSING THE OWNERS TO REMOVE THE ABS 60 AMP FUSE TO STOP THE LOUD HUMMING SOUND FROM UNDER THE DRIVER'S SEAT. THESE MODULES ARE GOING OUT JUST AFTER THE 36,000 MILE WARRANTY EXPIRES.THE COST TO REPLACE THIS UNIT IS EXTREMELY HIGH. MANY OWNERS REFUSE TO SPEND THIS MUCH MONEY ON A PART THAT SHOULD LAST MUCH LONGER THAN THAT, CAUSING THEM TO KEEP THE FUSE OUT. BY DOING THIS, IT MAKES THE BRAKE WARNING LIGHTS TO STAY ON ALL THE TIME. IF ANOTHER PROBLEM IN THE BRAKE SYSTEM WOULD DEVELOP, THE DRIVER WOULD HAVE NO PRIOR WARNING SOMETHING IS WRONG. THAT MAY BE A REAL SERIOUS HAZARD IN THE YEARS TO COME. NO WARNING-NO BRAKES!  GM HAS KNOWN THE PROBLEM EXISTS, AND SINCE IMPROVED THE LATER MODEL SILVERADOS. AT LEAST THEY COULD RE-WIRE A NEW BRAKE LIGHT FOR THOSE WHO CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE THE ABS FEATURE ON THEIR VEHICLE. MUST HAVE AN HYDRAULIC BRAKE WARNING OF SOME KIND TO AVOID SERIOUS ACCIDENTS! APPROX. COST OF REPAIR IS CLOSE TO $1,000. TOO MUCH FOR THE AVERAGE WORKING CLASS AMERICAN! SHOULD BE RECALLED BY GMC BEFORE THE ACCIDENTS START PILING UP.*AK",
