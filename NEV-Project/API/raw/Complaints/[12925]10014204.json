SPOKE WITH PONTIAC DEALER IN GAINESVILLE GA.  ACCORDING TO PARTS/SERVICE DEPARTMENT THERE ARE NO TECH BULLETINS RELEASED FROM GM.  WANTED TO KNOW IF THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER COMPLAINTS RE: 1995 PONTIAC BONNEVILLE'S 3800 V6'S.  ACCORDING TO INDEPENDENT GARAGE THE INTAKE GASKET AND HEAD GASKETS FAILURES.  THE CAR ALSO HAS A WATER LEAK INTO THE PASSENGER CABIN AND TRUNK AS WELL, APPEARS TO LEAKED SINCE IT WAS MANUFACTURED.  I OWNED AN OLDSMOBILE WITH A SIMILAR PROBLEM IN 1992 AND THE FACTORY DIDN'T SEAL THE COWL AREA PROPERLY WHEN THE CAR WAS ASSEMBLED. THANKS FOR YOUR INPUT! *JB",
