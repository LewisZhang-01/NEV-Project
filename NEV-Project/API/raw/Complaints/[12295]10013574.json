I DEALT WITH GM FOR ABOUT A MONTH AND THEY FINALLY TURNED ME DOWN FOR HELP BECAUSE I TOOK IT TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHO CHECKED IT OUT AND SAID THE TRANSMISSION GASKET WAS LEAKING, SO THEY REPLACED THAT AND WHEN IT STILL LEAKED THEY SAID IT WAS THE SENSOR TO THE THERMOSTAT AND BY THAT TIME IT WAS TOO LATE.  WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE CHEVY DEALER FOR A DIAGNOSTIC, THEY SAID IT WAS SHOT.  I HAVE KNOWN OF QUITE A FEW PEOPLE THAT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH GM CARS.  NOW, SINCE I HAVE BEEN WITHOUT A CAR FOR A MONTH, I AM GOING TO GET A USED MOTOR PUT IN IT.  THIS IS THE ONLY CAR I HAVE.",
