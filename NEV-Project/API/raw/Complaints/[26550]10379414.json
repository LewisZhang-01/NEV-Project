MY ENGINEER HUSBAND, WHO SPENT YEARS IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY, WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO DRIVE THE CAR AS, 'THE CAR IS GOING TO BREAK IN HALF WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD.'  I HAD IT TOWED TO OUR LOCAL REPAIR SHOP AND THEY VERIFIED THE SAME.  I CALLED THE FORD RECALL DEPARTMENT IN DETROIT AFTER SEEING THE WINDSTAR RECALL ON THE LOCAL NEWS.  FORD TOLD ME TO HAVE IT FIXED AND SAVE THE SLIP IN CASE A FEW YEARS FROM NOW IT WAS PART OF A RECALL I MIGHT BE ABLE TO BE REIMBURSED.  THIS REPAIR IS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.  I AM ON CHEMO WITH A CO-PAY OF $3102.98 AND FIFTEEN DOSES TO GO.  I CAN EITHER NOT LIVE AND BUY A CAR OR LIVE AND NOT HAVE A CAR.  AFTER EXPLAINING THIS TO THE FORD REP I WAS TOLD TO CONTACT YOU.  THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS CORROSION PROBLEM AND I DO NOT FEEL I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR WHAT IS ALREADY A RECALL ISSUE.  THE FORD CASE NUMBER IS [XXX].
