        "summary": "MY WIFE PURCHASED HER 2014 HYUNDAI TUCSON BRAND NEW AND WE HAVE MAINTAINED REGULAR OIL CHANGES AND KEPT UP WITH MAINTENANCE SCHEDULES. HER TUCSON IS AT 115K MILES AND IS BURNING A LOT OF OIL WITH NO LEAK AND NO ADDITIONAL WHITE SMOKE FROM THE TAIL PIPE. ITS BURNING ABOUT 2.5 TO 3 QUARTS OF OIL EVERY 1500 MILES (CONSERVATIVELY). I HAVE TRIED HIGH MILEAGE OILS AND THICKER WEIGHTS TO REDUCE THE BURNING. I HAVE TRIED LUCAS HEAVY DUTY OIL STABILIZER. NOTHING SEEMS TO KEEP THIS VEHICLE FROM CHUGGING DOWN OIL. MY CONCERN IS THAT MOST OF THE OTHER COMPLAINTS WERE DUE TO THE ENGINE SEIZING DUE TO LACK OF OIL. DO WE KNOW WHY THESE ENGINES ARE BURNING SO MUCH PR HOW WE CAN CHANGE THAT? MY HOPE FOR THIS COMPLAINT IS TO HELP OTHERS BEFORE THEY BURN UP THEIR ENGINES NOT REALIZING HOW FAST THEIR ENGINE IS BURNING OIL.",
