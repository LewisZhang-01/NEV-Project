        "summary": "OUR DODGE STRATUS HAD 38,000 MILES ON IT WHEN THE SWITCH CONTROLLING THE WIPER BLADES/WASHER SYSTEM FAILED WHILE DRIVING. THE WIPERS AND WASHER RAN CONTINUOUSLY. THE WIPERS WERE STOPPED ONLY BY PULLING THE 30 AMP FUSE UNDER THE HOOD. THE PUMP SUPPLYING WASHER FLUID TO THE WINDSHIELD COULD NOT BE STOPPED AT ALL EVEN AFTER IT RAN OUT OF FLUID. WHILE THE FAILURE DID NOT CAUSE AN ACCIDENT OR INJURIES, THE FAILURE COULD HAVE LED TO ONE WITH A LESS EXPERIENCED DRIVER. THE COST OF THE REPAIR AND THE SWITCH WAS $290.00. NEITHER DAIMLER/CHRYSLER NOR THE SELLING DEALERSHIP WOULD COVER THE COST OF ANY PART OF THE REPAIR EVEN THOUGH THE CAR WAS JUST 2000 MILES AND ONE MONTH BEYOND WARRANTY AND CLEARLY OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF A DEFECT. I AM REPORTING THIS INCIDENT IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OTHER OWNERS EXPERIENCE A SIMILAR PROBLEM.  *JB",
