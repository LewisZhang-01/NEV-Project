BRAKES SOMETIMES FEEL SPONGY AND TO THE FLOOR AND OTHER TIMES HARD LIKE A BRICK WITH VERY LITTLE GIVE AND THE CAR IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO STOP AND IMPOSSIBLE TO BRAKE QUICKLY.  THERE IS A HISSING SOUND PRESENT WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL IS DEPRESSED.  MOST CHALLENGING IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC OR COMING OFF OF HIGH SPEEDS GOING DOWNHILL. TERRIFYING TO DRIVE ESPECIALLY WITH MY CHILDREN IN THE CAR.",
