LUCKILY I WAS ON SAND, BECAUSE IF I WAS ON  HARD DIRT OR EVEN ASPHALT I COULD HAVE PROBABLY WENT OVER THE HANDLEBARS AND PROBABLY BROKEN SOMETHING.  I AM 6' 1\" 230 LBS. I CAN NOT AFFORD TO BE OUT OF WORK FOR SOMETHING THAT YAMAHA KNOWS ABOUT BECAUSE THEY CHANGED THE TRANSMISSION FOR THE 2002 YAMAHA RAPTORS. I KNOW OF SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE ALL WITH 2001 RAPTORS AND THEIR TRANSMISSION ALSO HAVE LOCKED UP ON THEM. I FEEL LIKE THAT YAMAHA SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED OR SERIOUSLY INJURED IF SOMEONE HAS NOT ALREADY.   *JB",
