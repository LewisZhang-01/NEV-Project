THE DOOR HANDLES INSIDE THE CAR WOULD NOT OPEN THE DOOR EITHER.  LUCKILY I REMEMBERED THAT IF I HELD DOWN ON ONE OF THE BUTTONS ON THE REMOTE CONTROL THE WINDOWS WOULD OPEN.  I THEN HAD TO CLIMB OUT OF THE WINDOW. THE TEMPERATURE INSIDE THE CAR WAS MORE THAN 100 DEGREES.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM.  IF I HAD NOT HAD THE REMOTE, I WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAPPED INSIDE THE CAR!  *TR",
