I TAPPED THE PEDDLE A COUPLE TIMES THINKING IT WAS CAUGHT ON THE FLOOR MATT (NOT).IT BACK OFF AND THEN IT DID IT BRIEFLY AGAIN BEFORE CORRECTING ITSELF. THIS WAS ALL IN A 10 SEC. TIME PERIOD.....  THE SECOND TIME IT HAPPENED I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY. I STEPPED DOWN TO PASS A CAR AND THE PEDDLE MOVED TO THE FLOOR AND STAYED THERE FOR ABOUT 15 SECONDS, RELEASED AND WENT TO THE FLOOR AGAIN FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS.  I HAD MY FOOT ON THE BREAK TRYING NOT TO HIT OTHER CARS AHEAD OF ME. EVERYTIME I LIFT MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE WE WENT FASTER. THEN IT CORRECTED ITSELF AGAIN.  I PULLED OFF THE  ROAD THE SECOND TIME AND CHECKED TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS NOTHING ON THE FLOOR BOARD THAT MIGHT HAVE INTERFERED WITH THE PEDDLE BUT THERE WAS NOTHING. I WAS NOT USING THE CRUISE CONTROL IN EITHER OCCURRENCE.  THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT BUT COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN. I DID HAVE A PASSENGER IN THE CAR.",
