        "summary": "I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE USED IN APRIL 2017, BUT A FEW MONTHS AFTER I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE  I STARTED HAVING A LIGHT ON IN THE DASH SAYING \"SERVICE AIR BAG\". I'VE TRIED IGNORING IT & HOPING THAT THERE WOULD EVENTUALLY BE A RECALL BECAUSE THE VEHICLE NO LONGER HAD A WARRANTY, BUT WE ARE ABOUT TO TAKE IT IN TO GET IT SERVICED. AFTER SEARCHING THE INTERNET I AM FINDING THAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE WITH ACADIAS HAVE HAD THIS SAME ISSUE & HAVE HAD TO TAKE THEIR VEHICLE & PAY TO GET IT SERVICED. I'VE ALSO READ WHERE THERE WERE SOME ACCIDENTS WHERE THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. I HAVE RESEARCHED ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT MANY GMC MODELS WERE RECALLED FOR THE SAME ISSUE, BUT IT WAS FOR YEAR MODELS PREVIOUS TO MINE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE YEAR BEFORE MINE). I HAVE A FRIEND WHO HAS THE CHEVROLET TRAVERSE (WHICH IS THE EXACT SAME VEHICLE AS MINE, JUST WITH THE CHEVROLET NAME) & SHE HAD THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM THAT I'M HAVING. IS THIS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE? PLEASE RESEARCH THIS. IT IS NOT COINCIDENCE THAT SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM! THIS LIGHT COMES ON AT ALL TIMES AS SOON AS YOU TURN ON THE CAR. I HAVE READ WHERE SOME HAVE HAD FAULTY WIRING UNDER THE SEAT THAT HAD TO BE RE-SOLDERED.",
