I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE USED WITH 17000 MILES SO CAN NOT TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES IT HAS HAPPENED PREVIOUSLY. IT IS NO WONDER I GOT A USED VEHICLE WITH SO LOW OF MILES. I HAVE LOST ALL FAITH IN DRIVING THIS TRUCK FOR ANY KIND OF DISTANCE. I HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY UNABLE TO MOVE STRANDED ON THE ROAD. ON ANOTHER OCCASION I HAD TO DRIVE FIFTY MILES TOWING A TRAILOR WITH VICE GRIPS CRIMPING MY BRAKE LINE AFTER I BROKE THE  CALIPER FREE AND GUESS WHAT THEY ARE LOCKED UP AGAIN.THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM AND VERY DANGEROUS",
