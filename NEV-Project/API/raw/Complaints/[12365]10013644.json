        "summary": "I RECENTLY TOOK DELIVERY OF A NEW INFINITY FX45. IT NOW HAS ABOUT 600 MILES ON IT.  THE HEADLIGHTS ARE AIMED TOO LOW TO ILLUMINATE THE ROAD AHEAD.  VISIBILITY IS SEVERELY LIMITED TO ABOUT 2+ CAR LENGTHS AHEAD.  I CANNOT MAINTAIN MINIMAL SPEED ON AN UNLIT HIGHWAY, OR WHEN OTHER CARS ARE NOT TRAVELING WITH ME.  THE DEALER STATES THAT THE HEADLIGHTS ARE \"WITHIN FACTOR SPEC\" AND WILL DO NOTHING TO ASSIST. HE WILL NOT CHECK IT AT NIGHT; NOR WILL HE CHECK MY CAR AGAINST OTHERS IN THE SHOP OR ON THE DEALERSHIP FLOOR. THE DEALER ADDS THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ADJUST THESE LIGHTS AS THERE IS NO ADJUSTMENT CAPABILITY BUILT INTO THE HEADLIGHT MODULE. THE DEALER, PEPE INFINITY, WHITE PLAINS, NY 10601, WILL NO LONGER DISCUSS THE PROBLEM WITH ME; NOR HAS ANYONE CONTACTED ME TO ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE.   IF I CANNOT DRIVE THE CAR AFTER DARK, I WANT TO GET ANOTHER CAR OR HAVE THE PROBLEM FIXED.  INFINITY USA SAYS EXACTLY THE SAME THING.  THEIR POSITION IS THAT IF INFINITY RELEASED THE CAR, IT MUST MEET ALL FEDERAL SPECIFICATIONS, AND WILL DO NOTHING MORE.  THEY DID AGREE TO LET ME VISIT ANOTHER INFINITY DEALER TO  \"INDEPENDENTLY\" CHECK THE HEADLIGHTS, BUT IT WILL PROBABLY BE AT MY OWN EXPENSE.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE CAR IS VIRTUALLY UNDRIVEABLE AT NIGHT UNLESS DRIVEN IN A LIGHTED AREA AND AT LOW SPEEDS.   *NLM",
