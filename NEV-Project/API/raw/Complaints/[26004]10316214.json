THIS HAS ALSO BEEN DESCRIBED AS \"GHOST-WALKING\" WHERE IT FEELS LIKE THE AWD SYSTEM IN THE REAR IS OVER COMPENSATING, LEADING TO THE VEHICLE BEING UNCONTROLLABLE. THE BEHAVIOR SEEMS TO HAPPEN IN THE 30-40MPH RANGE. ALTHOUGH, I PREFER NOT TO DRIVE ANY FASTER THAN THE ROAD CONDITIONS ALLOW, IT CAN BE VERY FRIGHTENING WHEN OTHER 2WD CARS AND TRUCKS ARE PASSING YOU GOING 20MPH FASTER AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO EVEN KEEP THE CAR ON THE ROAD OR IN A STRAIGHT LINE. *TR",
