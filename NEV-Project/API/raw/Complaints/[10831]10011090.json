        "summary": "YEAR 2000 - MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE GT WITH 17\" WHEEL OPTION - FACTORY EQUIPPED 17\" WHEEL/TIRE OPTION. DENTS REPEATEDLY WHEN CONTACT IS MADE WITH A MODERATE OR LARGER SIZE ROAD DEFECT. DENTED WHEELS LEAK AIR AND CAUSE CONSIDERABLE VIBRATION AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS DUE TO OUT OF BALANCE SITUATION DENTS CAUSE. A WHEEL SUDDENLY LOST ALL PRESSURE AND THE TIRE BECAME UNSEATED FROM THE RIM. FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE CAR BECAUSE THE INCIDENT HAPPENED AT A RELATIVELY LOW SPEED. THE RIM STRUCK THE GROUND DIRECTLY AND WAS DAMAGED WHERE TIRE CONTACTS WHEEL. I HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF CARS IDENTICAL TO MINE AND ALL OF THEM HAVE HAD AT LEAST ONE DENTED WHEEL (17\" WHEEL OPTION). ALL DENTS OCCUR WHERE THE WHEEL MEETS THE RIM ON THE OUTER FACING SIDE OF THE RIM. THE INNER RIM DOES NOT BEND, LEADING ME TO BELIEVE THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW. RIMS DENT AT RECOMMENDED TIRE PRESSURES. I HAVE ALREADY REPLACED 2 WHEELS AT MY OWN EXPENSE, AND THE REPLACEMENTS NOW HAVE MULTIPLE DENTS. I HAVE NOT ROTATED THE TIRES BECAUSE THE FRONT WHEELS ONLY DENT (I SUSPECT BECAUSE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THE VEHICLE'S WEIGHT IS BORNE BY THE FRONT WHEELS). IF I ROTATE THE WHEELS, ALL 4 WHEELS WILL SOON BE DENTED EXACERBATING THE PROBLEM.      *JB",
