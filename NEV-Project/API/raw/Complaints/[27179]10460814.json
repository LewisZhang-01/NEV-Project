        "summary": "VEHICLE SUDDENLY LOST POWER (DID NOT STALL) WHILE DRIVING 70 MPH ON INTERSTATE I40 IN A CONSTRUCTION ZONE (NO ACCESS TO MEDIAN BECAUSE OF CONCRETE CONSTRUCTION BARRIERS).  ENGINE POWER DID NOT ALLOW ME TO DRIVE OVER 35 MPH.  DASH BOARD INDICATOR STARTED FLASHING RED (ETC INDICATOR: ELECTRONIC THROTTLE CONTROL). SEVERAL TRACTOR TRAILERS HAD TO BRAKE HARD TO AVOID RUNNING INTO THE REAR OF MY VEHICLE.    ENGINE IS 3.0L MERCEDES DIESEL.  PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE A FAILED SWIRL MOTOR DUE TO EXCESSIVE OIL BLOW BY FROM A DEFECTIVE INTAKE TUBE WITH AN ORANGE GASKET.  THIS MERCEDES DIESEL ENGINE WAS USED IN JEEP GR CHEROKEE IN 2007 & 2008.  THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM WAS IDENTIFIED IN NHTSA ITEM #1006202 REGARDING MERCEDES VEHICLES BUT NEVER TO JEEP.      THIS SITUATION OF LOSS OF POWER WHILE HIGHWAY DRIVING COULD OF BEEN TRAGIC.  THIS JEEP 2007 & 2008 PROBLEM IS WELL DOCUMENTED IN VARIOUS JEEP FORUMS ON THE INTERNET. WHY IS NHTSA NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT???  *TR",
