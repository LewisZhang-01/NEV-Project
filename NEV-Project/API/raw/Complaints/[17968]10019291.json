THEY STOP WORKING ON ALMOST EVERY OCCASION THAT THEY ARE REQUIRED FOR VISIBILITY AND OFTEN WILL NOT STOP WHEN TURNED OFF AND ADDITIONALLY THE SPEED AT WHICH THEY WILL OPERATE IS ALSO UNRELIABLE. I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THE WIPERS TO RESUME OPERATION WHEN I HAVE TAPPED ON THE CIRCUIT BOARD COVER BUT THEY USUALLY STOP AGAIN BEFORE I REACH MY DESTINATION AND OFTEN BEFORE I GET BACK OUT ON THE ROAD. FROM THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT I HAVE READ OF AND PERSONALLY HEARD ABOUT  CONCERNING THIS MODEL YEAR (AND ALSO OTHER MODEL YEARS) WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM I FEEL THAT IT IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT A RECALL HAS NOT BEEN ISSUED TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM THAT APPEARS TO BE KNOWN BY THE MANUFACTURER AND EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED SO BY THE MANUFACTURER IN THE PREVIOUS MODEL YEAR. SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES WILL ARISE WHEN THESE FAULTY WIPER SYSTEMS FAIL A THE MOST CRITICAL OF TIMES, IF IT HASN'T ALREADY.  *NLM",
