        "summary": "WE PURCHASED THIS CAR IN JULY 2002 FROM CLASSIC CHEVROLET IN OWASSO, OK.  WE ALSO PURCHASED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY.  IN DECEMBER THE CAR WAS HIT FROM THE REAR BY A HIT AND RUN DRIVER.  IN JANUARY THE ENGINE BEGAN TO KNOCK.  I CALLED THE WARRANTY PLACE AND GOT PERMISSION TO TAKE IT TO A MECHANIC, HE SAID IT WAS THE INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET, REPLACED IT WHEN IT STILL KNOCKED HE SAID IT WOULD TAKE AWHILE FOR ALL THE WATER TO GET OUT OF THE ENGINE.  WE TOOK IT BACK, AND GOT A RUN AROUND FOR 4 WEEKS, FINALLY CALLED THE WARRANTY PLACE TOLD THEM HE WASN'T GETTING IT FIXED AND REQUESTED PERMISSION TO TAKE IT TO A DIFFERENT SHOP.  GRANTED THEN WHEN THEY FOUND OUT IT NEEDED A NEW ENGINE THEY REFUSED TO PAY FOR IT, SAID THEY WOULD ONLY CONTRIBUTE A SUM OF MONEY TOWARD FIXING IT.  I CALLED GMAC BECAUSE THEY FINANCED THE WARRANTY, ONE PERSON TOLD ME THAT GM SHOULD HONOR THE WARRANTY AND SO I HAVE A CALL IN TO A DEALER IN PITTSBURGH, KS.  WE NO LONGER HAVE A GM DEALER IN OUR TOWN.  MY POINT IS THAT SOMEONE NEEDS TO MAKE THIS RIGHT AND PUT A NEW ENGINE IN MY CAR AT NO MORE EXPENSE TO ME.  WHEN I TALK TO GM I WILL BE LETTING THEM KNOW THAT I FOUND YOUR SITE AND CHECKED IT OUT, AND LODGED A COMPLAINT.   I AM UNSURE OF THE EXACT DATE OF THE INCIDENT AND SINCE IT IS 4:15AM AM UNABLE TO CALL AND GET IT.   *NLM",
