IT JUST SAID SERVICE VEHICLE ON THE MESSAGE CENTER SCREEN. I DRIVE 120 MILES PER DAY SOMETIMES AND I HAVE DONE ONLINE RESEARCH AND HAVE FOUND HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS CAR. IT NOT ONLY HAPPENS WITH THIS YEAR AND MAKE BUT WITH OTHER MAKES TOO! THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND DANGEROUS. THE WEATHER WHERE I LIVE GETS DOWN TO 30 BELOW ZERO SOMETIMES AND I CANNOT AFFORD TO NOT BE ABLE TO START MY CAR. I AM A FULL-TIME STUDENT WITH 3 CHILDREN AND A HUSBAND THAT WORKS OUT OF TOWN. I CANNOT AFFORD THE NUMEROUS CAR REPAIRS THAT PEOPLE ARE REPORTING THAT THEY HAD TO HAVE DONE ON THIS TYPE OF CAR. WHY HASN'T THEIR BEEN A RECALL?!!! *TR",
