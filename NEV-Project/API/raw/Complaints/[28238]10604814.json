VEHICLE BROUGHT IN, DEALER STATED THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS.  THE PROBLEM IS VERY INTERMITTENT, THAT IS TO SAY IT DOESN'T DO IT ALL THE TIME BUT THIS HAS LEFT ME IN A DANGEROUS SPOT WHILE CHANGING LANES OR PULLING OUT ONTO A STREET FROM A STOPPED POSITION; I CAN FLOOR THE GAS PEDAL AND IT SLUGGISHLY ACCELERATES.  THE RPM OFTEN RACES WHEN TRYING TO ACCELERATE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AFTER HAVING TO SLOW DOWN FOR TRAFFIC ISSUES.    THIS CAR DOES NOT GET CLOSE TO THE QUOTED FUEL MILEAGE THAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO FOR AN LT; MY SOLE REASON FOR PURCHASING THIS CAR.  *TR",
