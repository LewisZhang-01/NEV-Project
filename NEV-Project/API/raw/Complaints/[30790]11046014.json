IT HAS THE FOLLOWING MESSAGES IN THE DASHBOARD.  1- 'EPS FAILURE. STEERING WHEEL IS HARDER TO TURN'. 2- 'THE ENGINE HAS STOPPED. PLEASE PUT THE SHIFT LEVER TO P'. 3- 'TRAC OFF' 4- 'BRAKE OVERRIDE SYSTEM FAILURE'. MY CAR HAD SAME ISSUE BACK AUG 2017 BUT  THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP CLAIMED THAT THEY DIDN'T SEE SUCH ISSUE AND THE CAR STARTED NORMAL. I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF DIAGNOSTICS THEY PERFORMED BECAUSE I AM HAVING THE SAME ISSUE WHICH HAS SIMILAR SYMPTOM AS THE  RECALL ISSUE (NHTSA CAMPAIGN # 15V14000) FOR TOYOTA HIGHLANDER 2015  MODELS. IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS SECURITY FAULT BECAUSE MY CAR WAS IDOL WHILE I WAS DRIVING AND THE STEERING WHEEL JAMMED. ON BOTH OCCASION THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY.",
