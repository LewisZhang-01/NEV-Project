THE CAR COMPANY ( NOT THE DEALER) HAS BEEN RUDE, NON-RESPONSIVE, AND EVASIVE. THEY HAVE EVEN REFUSED TO CALL ME BACK, REFUSED TO TELL ME (TODAY IS ONE MONTH SINCE THE ACCIDENT) IF THEY TESTED MY AIR BAG, HAVE NEVER ASKED OR EVER ALLOWED ME TO SHARE DETAILS OF THE ACCIDENT, AND HAVE NEVER ALLOWED ME TO SHARE DETAILS OF MY INJURY. THEY HAVE BEEN RUDE ON THE PHONE REPEATEDLY AND SEEM TO SHOW NO INTEREST AT ALL IN SEEING THAT MY FAMILY RIDES IN A SAFE CAR. THEY HAVE BEEN SIX PREVIOUS MECHANICAL PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR THAT THEY REFUSE TO TALK ABOUT EVEN THOUGH FOUR OF THESE INVOLVE A 'SILENT\" RECALL THAT DEALER MECHANICS WERE AWARE OF, BUT I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO KNOW ABOUT. I DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE TO EVER EXPERIENCE THIS FLIPPANT RUDE ATTITUDE FROM AN AUTO COMPANY.  *NLM",
