MANUALLY CHANGING THE GEARSHIFT DOES NOT OVERRIDE THE FAILURE.  THE ONBOARD COMPUTER DOES NOT LOG THE FAILURE.  IT DOES CAPTURE THE MANUAL SHIFTING EVENT.  THE ONLY WAY TO CORRECT THE PROBELM IS TO TURN OFF THE VAN AND START IT BACK UP.  THIS COULD CORRECT IT FOR SEVERAL DAYS OR IT MAY RECUR WITHING MINUTES.  TOTALLY RANDOM.  OCCURS AT ANY TIME, NIGHT OR DAY.  IT OFTEN OCCURS DURING ACCELLERATIONS FOLLOWING TURNS.  THIS SITUATION IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY WHEN ACCELLERATING ONTO THE FREEWAY DURING RUSHHOUR TRAFFIC.  WE HAVE TO PULLOFF INTO THE EMERGENCY LANE, SHUT OFF THE VAN, RESTART IT UP, AND MERGE BACK INTO HIGH SPEED TRAFFIC.  IT IS EXTERMRLY FRIGHTENING FOR MY WIFE ESPECIALLY WHILE TRANSPORTING MY TWO YOUNG BOYS.  THE CHRYSLER REPAIR SHOP COULD NOT GET IT TO FAIL AND THUS NOTHING WAS DONE.  AAMCO LOOKED AT THE TRANSMISSION AND INDICATED THE TRANSMISSION AND FLUIDS WERE FINE.  THEY ALSO COULD NOT GET THE TRANSMISSION TO FAIL.",
