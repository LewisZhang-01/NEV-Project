DEALER SAYS VW IS AWARE OF ISSUE, BUT THEY WILL ONLY REPAIR THE COIL THAT'S BROKEN.THIS IS COSTING THEM MORE MONEY IN THE LONG RUN AS THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE RENTALS TO USERS, AND WILL BE LIABLE SHOULD A COIL FAILURE CAUSE AN ACCIDENT OR EVEN DEATH. HAVE TRIED TO ADDRESS WITH VW BUT IT'S BEEN DISMISSED (THEIR CASE NUMBER 30003124). THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS NHTSA SUPPORT. ANOTHER CONCERN IS THAT MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE DEFFECTIVE AND THE LOCAL DEALER HAS HAD THEM ON BACKORDER FOR OVER A MONTH. APPARENTLY THERE IS A NATIONWIDE SHORTAGE AND THERE ARE NO OTHER REPLACEMENTS FOR THE PASSAT BLADES. THE DEALER ASKED THAT I COME SO THEY COULD REPLACE IT WITH THOSE OFF A NEW CAR.",
