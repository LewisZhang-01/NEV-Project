THE LEFT REAR WHEEL BEARINGS HAD TO BE REPLACED TWICE BEFORE 35K MILES AND THE RIGHT REAR WHEEL BEARING JUST FAILED AT 50K MILES.  CLEARLY SUBARU HAS A DESIGN AND/OR MANUFACTURING PROBLEM WITH THE 1999 SUBARU REAR WHEEL BEARINGS. I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE BUT HAVING A WHEEL BEARING FAIL COMPLETELY AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS WOULD SEEM LIKE A BAD THING.[I FOUND OUT ABOUT YOUR SITE ON CARTALK.COM].   NLM",
