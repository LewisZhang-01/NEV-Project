I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT IT IS MY REGULATOR THAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. I ALSO FOUND A BROKEN CLIP JUST SITTING INSIDE MY DOOR. YOU CAN'T BUY JUST A REGULATOR OR CLIPS SO I WILL NEED TO BUY THOSE PARTS PLUS THE MOTOR WHICH WILL COST AT LEAST $280. MY ROTORS ALSO NEEDED TO BE SHAVED DOWN BECAUSE THEY WERE WARPED AND MY BRAKES NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND NOW, ONLY 5 MONTHS LATER, THEY NEED TO BE TOTALLY REPLACED BECAUSE THEY ARE WARPED AGAIN AND MY BRAKES WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED AS WELL. THIS IS THE WORST CAR I'VE EVER OWNED! MY FIRST AND LAST EXPERIENCE I WILL EVER HAVE WITH GM!! I REALIZE THINGS HAPPEN TO CARS, BUT I WOULD EXPECT OLDSMOBILE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THESE RE-OCCURRING PROBLEMS AND BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO FIX THEM.   *NLM",
