A COUPLE MONTHS LATER MY CAR STARTED TO MAKE NOISE SO I TOOK IT BACK WHERE I GOT IT FIXED AT AND WAS ADVISED I NEED A NEW ENGINE.  I CONTACTED GMAC AND THEY DIDN'T RESPOND UNTIL DECEMBER 24, 2002 AND TOLD ME THEY WOULDN'T PAY FOR THE ENGINE SINCE I DIDN'T GET MY CAR REPAIRED AT A GMAC DEALERSHIP.  I TOLD THEM WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE CHEVROLET DEALER THEY SAID I COULDN'T GET MY CAR IN UNTIL THE FOLLOWING WEEK AND I COULDN'T WAIT THAT LONG BECAUSE I NEEDED MY VEHICLE SO I TOOK IT TO ANOTHER SHOP.  HAD I BEEN TOLD WHEN I FIRST CALLED GMAC I WOULD HAVE TRIED TO TAKE IT TO ANOTHER CHEVROLET SHOP.  I AM PAYING FOR A CAR THAT I CAN'T EVEN DRIVE AND THE VEHICLE IS ONLY 3 YEARS OLD.  PLEASE ADVISE AS TO WHAT I CAN DO TO HAVE THIS MATTER RESOLVED.",
