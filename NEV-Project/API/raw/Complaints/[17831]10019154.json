THE DEALER REPLACED THE COMPUTER.\"ADDITIONAL DATA: 1ST EVENT, 2 WEEKS AFTER DELIVERY, MAY 2002. RANDOM OPENING OF THE STEPS WHILE DRIVING IN RENO ON STREET, STEP OUT LIGHT CAME ON AND I HEARD STEP MOVE, I SWERVED JUST IN TIME AVOIDED HITTING RENO POLICEMAN STANDING AT SIDEWALK EDGE. AS PASTED THE STEP MOVED BACK IN.  HE WAS SAVED. (LUCKILY)  MY WIFE WITNESSED THE EVENT. I SPENT TIME ON COUNTRY COACH\u0019S HELP LINE ASKING WHAT TO DO TO FIX IT. I WAS TOLD, \u001cADJUST THE SWITCH AT THE BACK OF THE STEP ASSEMBLY\u001d. SUPPORT FELT THIS WAS EASY FIX SO I DID IT.  OTHER I TOOK THE SPOTLIGHT, THE COACH ENDED UP AT THE FACTORY;  THE FAC TORY WAS ASKED TO VERIFY  MY FIX.  THEY REPORTED VERBALLY THAT ALL THE SETTINGS WHERE VERIFIED.  NO PROBLEMS FOUND. EVENTS CONTINUED TO RANDOMLY, LONG INTERVALS 1000 TO 5000 MILES. FINALLY EVENTS SEEMED TO STOP.  COACH LEFT IN DECEMBER 02 AT COUNTRY COACH FOR SERVICE, HAD NOT HAD ANY REPEATS FOR A LONG TIME.

THE STEPS RANDOMLY MOVED IN AND OUT. AFTER SOME CLOSE CALLS DURING THE CHRISTMAS 02 HOLIDAY, CONTACTED COUNTRY COACH. TOLD TAKE COACH INTO SERVICE LOCALLY, LOCAL SERVICE COMPANY THE STEP WAS UNCONTROLLABLY OPENING AND CLOSING ON ITS OWN.  THE SHOP PERSONNEL SAW IT FIRST HAND. AFTER EMAILS REQUESTING COUNTRY COACH ASSUME LIABILITY AND ASSURE ME THAT THE COACH WAS SAFE. I PICKED IT UP AND TRYED TO USE THE COACH. THE FIX THAT THE DEALER INSTALLED AT MY INSISTENCE WAS A REPLACEMENT COMPUTER.  THIS COULD BE A LIFE-THREATENING EVENT FOR BOTH CARS AND PEDESTRIANS NEAR THE COACH STAIRS. CANNOT TELL IF THIS WAS FIXED OR IF THE ISSUE IS STILL PRESENT. THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED BEFORE THE SUMMER RV SEASON TO PREVENT DEATH OR INJURY.",
