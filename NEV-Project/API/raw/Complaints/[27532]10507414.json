ON THEIR REPORT THEY STATED \"THE VEHICLE'S OPERATING AS DESIGNED.\"  SINCE I BOUGHT THIS CAR IT'S BEEN PERFORMING PROGRESSIVELY WORSE.  EVERY TIME I DRIVE THE CAR IT SEEMS TO LOSE POWER.  THE RIDE IS CHOPPY, BURDENED, AND LABORED.  THE ENTIRE CAR SEEMS TO BE STRUGGLING WITH ITSELF.  I GET INTO THE CAR FEELING FINE PHYSICALLY, AND THEN I FEEL ILL AND SICK AFTER A WHILE.  THERE'S FOUL ODORS COMING FROM MY CAR, DEFINITELY FROM THE EXTERIOR AND POSSIBLY FROM THE INSIDE.  THE DEALERSHIP CHECKED FOR EXHAUST LEAKS AND DIDN'T FIND ANY, BUT I'M SMELLING THINGS IN THE CAR NO ONE SHOULD BE SMELLING.  IT EVEN SEEMS LIKE THE CAR WOBBLES AND SHIMMIES AS IT TRAVELS DOWN THE ROAD.  *TR",
