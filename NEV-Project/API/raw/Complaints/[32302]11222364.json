I RECENTLY PURCHASED A 2017 V12S VANTAGE (VIN ENTERED PREVIOUSLY) - BRAND NEW A FEW MONTHS AGO - BOTH REAR TAIL LIGHTS HAVE CONDENSATION.  THE ISSUE IS THAT ANY WATER IN THE TAIL LIGHTS EVENTUALLY DESTROYS THE LED CIRCUIT BOARDS AND THEN THERE ARE NO TAIL LIGHTS.  THE ONLY VANTAGE I'VE OWNED THAT DID NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM WAS A 2007.  THIS IS A WELL KNOWN PROBLEM, AND A SAFETY PROBLEM AS WELL AS WHEN NOT UNDER WARRANTY AN EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE FIX.  IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL A LONG TIME AGO.  PICTURES ARE FROM MY CURRENT CAR.  I DID NOT EVEN HAVE THE CAR A WEEK, BEFORE THE ISSUE STARTED UP.
