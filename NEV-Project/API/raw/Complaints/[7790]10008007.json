        "summary": "I WAS CONSTANTLY HAVING PROBLEMS STOPPING ON ICE/SNOW.  IT SEEMED THAT NO MATTER HOW I BRAKED MY ABS SYSTEM WOULD ACTIVATE AND THE VEHICLE WOULD ROLL THROUGH STOP LIGHTS AND STOP SIGNS.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS THE BRAND OF TIRES THAT CAME WITH THE TRIBUTE, SO PURCHASE A NEW SET OF GOODYEAR SNOW AND MUD TIRES AFTER ONLY 12,000 AT A COST OF $300.  BUT THE PROBLEM PERSISTED THE NEXT WINTER.  THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED TO FINALLY TAKE IT TO MY MECHANIC AND WAS TOLD THAT THE MASTER CYLINDER CAP WAS CRACKED AND THAT MY REAR BRAKES WERE NOT BEING USED HARDLY AT ALL.  NEARLY ALL OF THE BRAKING FORCE ON MY VEHICLE WAS BEING DONE BY THE FRONT BRAKES.  THIS WOULD EXPLAIN WHY I WAS HAVING SUCH DIFFICULTIES STOPPING ON ICE AND SNOW.  TO NO SURPRISE, MY FRONT BRAKES HAD TO BE REPLACED AT ONLY 26,000 MILES AND IT COST ME $130.  I DID GET THE MASTER CYLINDER CAP REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY, BUT YOU MIGHT WANT TO WATCH THIS IN THE FUTURE.  I HOPE YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS COULD CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT, ESPECIALLY IF THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH THE MANUFACTURING OF THE VEHICLE.",
