THE DOUBLE BUCKLE SYSTEM ON THE COSCO TOURIVA CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE SEAT WEBBING.  I CHANGED TO A DIFFERENT SEAT WITH A DIFFERENT BUCKLE SYSTEM.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE POINTS ON THE TOP PIECE THAT GOES INTO THE BUCKLE CAN EASILY GET CAUGHT IN THE SEAT HARNESS WEBBING IN THE TRANSFERRING IN OR OUT OF THE CHILD TO/FROM THE SEAT.  THE WEBBING THEN GETS PULLED AND STRETCHED.  I HAVE NOTICED THAT IT HAS HAPPENED ON OTHER TOURIVA'S I HAVE CHECKED.  THE OCCURRENCE CAN BE DETECTED BY STRETCHED OR MISSHAPEN AREAS IN THE HARNESS WEBBING.  I PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE DETECTED IT IF IT HADN'T HAPPENED TO MY OWN CHILD'S SEAT.   I CAN NOT IMAGINE THIS DOESN'T DAMAGE THE HARNESS WEBBING.   *NLM",
