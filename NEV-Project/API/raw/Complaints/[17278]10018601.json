THIS LEFT THE BOLT STILL ANCHORED TO THE SLIDER FOR THE SEAT ADJUSTER.  THE SEATS ROCK BACK AND FORTH. NOT ONLY IS THIS A SAFETY ISSUE, BUT IT MAKE THE SEAT EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE. I DON'T HAVE EXACT DATES AS TO WHEN THIS HAPPENED. THE DATE ON THE FORM IS WRONG AND ONLY SHOWS BECAUSE IT WAS A REQUIRED FIELD. *JB",
