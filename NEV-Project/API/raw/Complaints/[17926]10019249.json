        "summary": "VIBRATION WHEN APPLYING BRAKES.  WARPED ROTORS AT ONLY 27,000 MILES WHEN USED ONLY FOR COMMUTING TO AND FROM WORK, MAINLY HIGHWAY MILES. WAS TOLD THAT MANY THINGS COULD CAUSE PREMATURE WEARING AND OR WARPING OF THE ROTORS SUCH AS HEAVY TOWING AND HIGH TEMP'S. NONE OF WHICH THE TRUCK HAS ENDURED.  I DO NOT/HAVE NOT TOWED ANYTHING AND FURTHERMORE THE WARPING HAPPENED IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER SO, HIGH HEAT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE EITHER.  I'VE DONE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ONLINE AND REALIZE NOW THAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH THIS MODEL AND YEAR.  DODGE WILL NOT ASSIST WITH RESOLVING THE ISSUE AS THEY WILL ONLY WARRANTY ROTORS UP TO 12,000 MILES.  THE OTHER CASES I'VE READ ABOUT SEEM TO HAPPEN AT OR WITHIN 10,000 MILES. THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT DODGE NEEDS TO ADDRESS AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OF. NOT ONLY THE BRAKE ISSUE BUT I AM ALSO EXPERIENCING SIMILAR PROBLEMS AS OTHERS WITH THE UPPER BALL JOINTS.  MINE HAVE ALREADY HAD TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE THEY WERE SO LOOSE THAT YOU COULD MOVE THEM WITH YOUR HAND. DODGE SHOULD BE HELP ACCOUNTABLE FOR THESE ISSUES!!!!  *NLM",
