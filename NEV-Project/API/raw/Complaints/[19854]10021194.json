I IMMEDIATELY OPENED THE FUSE PANEL AND ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE THE MAIN FUSE. THE UPPER MAIN BUSS THAT CONTROLS THE POWER SEAT MOTORS, POWER DOORS, AND ANTI-THEFT SYSTEM WAS SO HOT THAT I COULD NOT TOUCH IT WITHOUT BURNING MY FINGERS. I HAD TO USE A PEN KNIFE TO REMOVE IT. NO OTHER FUSES WERE AFFECTED. FOLLOWING REMOVAL OF THE FUSE MY TURN SIGNALS, EMERGENCY FLASHERS, AND REAR STOP LIGHTS ARE ALL INOPERATIVE. THESE ELEMENTS ARE ON A SEPARATE CIRCUIT FROM THE MAIN BUSS I REMOVED. I BELIEVE THAT HAD I NOT GOTTEN THE FUSE REMOVED WHEN I DID THE ELECTRICAL SHORT WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A SERIOUS FIRE.   *JB",
