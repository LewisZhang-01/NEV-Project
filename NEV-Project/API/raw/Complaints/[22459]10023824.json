THE DEALER INFORMED ME THAT THE PARKING BRAKE WAS NOT OPERATING PROPERLY (WOULD NOT HOLD THE VEHICLE).  SINCE IT IS A WEAR ITEM IT WASN'T COVERED BY THE WARRANTY.  I HAVE OWNED SEVERAL GM VEHICLES AS WELL AS MANY OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS AND I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE PARKING BRAKE WEARING OUT, LET ALONE PRIOR TO 30K MILES.    THE ORIGINAL DEALER GAVE US AN ESTIMATE OF $800 TO FIX THE PARKING BRAKE. AT THIS TIME WE ARE WAITING A RESPONSE FROM GM'S CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT.*AK",
