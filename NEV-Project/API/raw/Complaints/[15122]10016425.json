NOW HAVE 18,400 MILES. - PISTON SLAP IS LOUDER AND MORE PERSISTENT.  GM HAS ACKNOWLEDGED PROBLEM, ISSUED SERVICE REQUEST #, BUT NO SERVICE AND NO RESPONSE.  VERY DISAPPOINTED IN GM CUSTOMER SERVICE AND PRODUCT.  GM SHOULD REMEDY HUGE ENGINEERING MISTAKE AND FIX THESE ENGINES OR BUY VEHICLES BACK!    *JB",
