MANY OTHERS HAVE REPORTED THIS PROBLEM, WITH MULTIPLE LATCH REPLACEMENTS HAVING NOT SOLVED IT.  IT IS A DESIGN DEFECT.  IF ONE WERE IN A COLLISION AND THE DOORS WERE JAMMED, PEOPLE COULD NOT BE REMOVED THROUGH THE HATCH.  IF ONE HAD A FLAT TIRE BESIDE THE ROAD, THE SPARE COULD NOT BE ACCESSED.  IF MEDICATION WERE NEEDED, IT COULD NOT BE RETRIEVED PROMPTLY.   THE DATE MENTIONED BELOW IS ONLY ONE OF THE MANY TIMES THIS HAS HAPPENED WHEN WE HAVE VISITED COLD WEATHER AREAS.  IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY WHEN THE TEMPERATURE IS BELOW FREEZING.",
