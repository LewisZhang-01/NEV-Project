WE TOOK THE CAR IN TO HAVE HIM LOOK AT THE PROBLEM AND HE TOLD US WE HAD A \"PULLED\" HEAD GASKET.  HE SAID HE COULD NOT DO THAT TYPE OF WORK AND REFERRED US TO ANOTHER MECHANIC WHO PRESSURE TESTED AND RAN OTHER DIAGNOSTICS BEFORE HOISTING THE CAR ON THE RACKS.  UPON INSPECTION HE SAW COOLANT DRIPPING FROM THE INTAKE MANIFOLD AND PROCEEDED TO REMOVE AND INSPECT THAT PART OF THE ENGINE.  EVENTUALLY, THE HEAD AND OTHER PARTS TO REVEAL THE LOOSE BOLTS WITH STRIPPED THREADS.    WE BELIEVE THIS IS A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT AND FEEL SOME COMPENSATION AND RESTITUTION MUST BE LEVIED.  UPON FURTHER RESEARCH FROM DIFFERENT FORUMS WE HAVE DOCUMENTED PAGES OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS FROM ACROSS THE NATION.  PLEASE MAKE OUR CONCERNS HEARD.  WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO CAR TO DRIVE AND $ 0 MONEY TO PURCHASE ANOTHER VEHICLE.   *TR",
