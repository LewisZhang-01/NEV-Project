CONSEQUENTLY IT WOULDN'T OPEN AND HAD TO BE TAKEN BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP. CHRISLER REPAIRED THE REAR ENTRY MECHANISM BUT THEN THE DEALERSHIP, IN ITS HASTY REPAIR, STRIPPED OUT ALL OF THE SCREWS THAT HOLD THE REAR LIFTGATE MOLDING IN PLACE SO THEY ALL FELL OUT. FEARING MORE DAMAGE WOULD BE CAUSED BY THE DEALERSHIP IN ANOTHER REPAIR I REPLACED THE SCREWS WITH LARGER SHEET METAL SCREWS WHICH LOOK DUMB.",
