        "summary": "THE DASHBOARD ON MY 2003 DODGE RAM 1500 HAS MULTIPLE CRACKS IN IT. THE MOST CONCERNING CRACK IS LOCATED ABOVE THE PASSENGER AIRBAG. ALSO THE ASSIST HANDLE ON THE DRIVER SIDE HAS BEEN REPLACED AND HAS BROKEN AGAIN. THE PART IS EXPENSIVE AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY TO REPLACE THIS FAULTY PIECE AGAIN. CONSEQUENTLY, I HAVE HAD TO DISCONTINUE THE USE OF THE ASSIST HANDLE. I AM ONLY 5'2\" AND IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO MANEUVER IN AND OUT OF THE VEHICLE SAFELY WITHOUT THE GRAB HANDLE. THE CRACKS BEGAN IN 2008 AND HAVE BEEN MULTIPLYING SINCE THEN. I WILL BE DRIVING DOWN THE STREET AND HEAR A CRACK AND THERE IS ANOTHER CRACK IN THE DASH. THE VENT AREAS HAVE ALL FALLEN THROUGH INTO THE HEATING/COOLING COMPARTMENTS CAUSING RATTLING. *TR",
