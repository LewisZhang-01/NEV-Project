        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE FREEWAY AT 70 MPH WHEN MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ILLUMINATED AND I IMMEDIATELY LOST SPEED CONTROL. MY SPEED BEGAN A QUICK DECENT TO 25 MPH. THE CAR WOULD NOT PICK UP AT ALL. I MADE IT TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TURNED OFF THE CAR. I CALLED MY HUSBAND, HE ASKED A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS AND HAD ME RESTART THE CAR. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS STILL ON, BUT THE CAR ACCELERATED NORMALLY SO I HEADED TOWARD HOME. IT HAPPENED AGAIN. I PULLED OVER, WAITED AND RESTARTED THE CAR. MY HUSBAND HAD ME GO TO THE AUTO PARTS STORE TO HAVE THE CODE READ. I HAVE ATTACHED PICTURES OF THE PRINTOUTS THAT INCLUDE THE CODES AND DEFINITIONS.  I LOOKED UP THE ISSUE AND SEE ACROSS CAR REPAIR FORUMS THAT THIS IS A WIDESPREAD ISSUE WITH KIA VEHICLES. IT'S TIME FOR NHTSA TO FORCE A RECALL. CORPORATIONS WOULD RATHER PAY A WRONGFUL DEATH/INJURY FINE THAN VOLUNTARILY MAKE WIDESPREAD REPAIRS TO MECHANISMS THEY KNOW ARE FAULTY. PROTECT OUR INTERESTS; THE SAFETY OF DRIVERS, OUR LOVED ONES, THE ROADS AND OUR LIVELIHOODS- IF I CAN'T GET TO WORK RELIABLY, I WON'T HAVE A JOB. WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY FOR EXPENSIVE REPAIRS WHEN THE PRODUCT IS FAULTY ACROSS THE BOARD.  FORCE A RECALL.",
