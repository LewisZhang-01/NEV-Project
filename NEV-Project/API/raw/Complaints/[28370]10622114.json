MY WIFE RECEIVED MINOR BURNS TO HER LEG AS A RESULT OF THE HEAT EMITTING FROM THE PLASTIC SIDE PANELS.  WE HAVE RETURNED IT TO THE DEALER AND THEY  INSTALLED SOME ALUMINUM FOIL ON DOUBLE SIDED TAPE TO TRY TO CUT DOWN THE HEAT.  THIS HAD LITTLE EFFECT.  THE DEALER CONTACTED BRP AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND WHAT OTHERS HAD DONE TO MITIGATE IT AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE.  THE BIKE IS BACK IN THE SHOP AND I'VE EMAILED BRP CUSTOMER CARE TO SEE WHAT THEY INTEND TO DO ABOUT IT.   *TR",
