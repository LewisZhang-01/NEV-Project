        "summary": "MY 2007 FLHTC HARLEY DAVIDSON HAS BEEN A LEMON SINCE I BOUGHT IT IN 2007. THE BIKE ALWAYS RUNS HOT DUE TO THE FACT THERE IS NO OIL PRESSURE AT TIMES. THE CPK UNIT WENT OUT AND LEAKED OIL EVERYWHERE AFTER ONE MONTH. THE FRONT PART OF THIS UNIT, WHICH WAS INSIDE THE MOTOR, WAS DAMAGED. THE DEALERSHIP SAID SOMETHING HAD TO HAVE HIT IT. INSTEAD OF TEARING DOWN THE MOTOR TO FIND OUT WHAT HIT IT THEY JUST REPLACED IT. OIL PRESSURE CONSTANTLY DROPS AFTER RIDING FOR AWHILE. THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT WAS NORMAL. NOW THE BIKE HAS NO OIL PRESSURE AND IS LEAKING OIL FROM SOMEWHERE. IT IS BACK AT THE DEALERSHIP BEING WORKED ON AGAIN. I DO NOT TRUST THIS BIKE TO GO ANYWHERE FAR FROM HOME. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH EITHER THE OIL PUMP OR THE WAY OIL IS CIRCULATED. YOU HAVE TO LOOK WHILE RIDING TO SEE IF OIL IS LEAKING FROM SOMEWHERE. IF THE MOTOR LOCKS UP FROM LACK OF OIL THE BIKE WILL BE PAST DANGEROUS. OIL PUMP ALIGNMENT HAS BEEN MENTIONED ON WEB SITES AS THE PROBLEM. HARLEY WILL NOT STAND BEHIND FIXING THIS BIKE CORRECTLY. THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL.  *TR",
