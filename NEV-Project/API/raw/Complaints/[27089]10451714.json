THIS REALLY IS A SAFETY ISSUE FOR SEVERAL REASONS. WHEN THE FIRST ONE FAILED IT WAS THE DRIVERS FRONT DOOR, IT FAILED IN AN UNLOCKED POSITION. THATS GREAT, WE COULD STILL OPEN THE DOOR. BUT SO COULD A CARJACKER! WE DROVE THIS WAY FOR A MONTH BEFORE WE FOUND THAT THE DRIVERS DOOR DIDN'T LOCK.  NOW WE ARE HAVING A SIMILAR PROBLEM, BUT NOW IT IS THE PASSANGER REAR DOOR. IT IS INTERMITTENT IN IT'S OCCURANCE BUT IT IS CONSISTENTLY IN THE LOCKED POSITION, I AM GOING TO REPLACE THIS NOW SINCE WE KNOW ABOUT IT, BUT IF WE HAVE AN ACCIDENT AND ONE HAS FAILED IN THE LOCKED POSITION AND WE DONT KNOW ABOUT IT. WE WILL BE UNABLE TO GET OUR CHILDREN OUT IN A TIMELY MANNER. I REALLY THINK THIS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED.  *TR",
