FINALLY, AFTER NUMEROUS ALIGNMENTS AND TIRE REPLACEMENTS A FRIEND MECHANIC NOTICED BEARINGS WHICH CAUSED NOISE FROM ORIGINAL PURCHASE DATE. CLICKING NOISE AT LOW SPEEDS AND TURNS TURNED INTO LOUD GRIND, WHICH IS WHEN PERSONAL MECHANIC FOUND PROBLEM. ONE DEALERSHIP SAID THE PROBLEM WAS FRONT SHOCKS. REPLACED THEM BUT DID NOT SOLVE PROBLEM. DEALERSHIPS ARE AVOIDING PROBLEM HOPING WARRANTIES RUN OUT. I EQUATE CAR DEALERSHIPS/SERVICE DEPARTMENTS WITH CARNIVAL WORKERS. THIS IS THEIR CASH COW!!!!!",
