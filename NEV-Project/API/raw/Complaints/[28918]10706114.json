        "summary": "MY VEHICLE WAS EXHIBITING A BURNT RUBBER SMELL FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  I OPENED THE HOOD AND SAW LIKE SMOKE COMING FROM THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE OF THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO THE DEALER FOR SERVICE AND NOTED THIS INCIDENT ON THE WORK ORDER.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN LATER INFORMED ME THAT THE TRANSFER CASE WAS LEAKING FLUID AND WAS BLOWING ONTO THE EXHAUST PIPE AND UNDER CARRIAGE.  THEY SAID THAT IS WHAT CAUSED THE BURNT RUBBER SMELL, NOT A DRIVE BELT.  THE WARRANTY FOR THIS COMPONENT EXPIRED AT 60,000 MILES.  I WAS CHARGED APPROX. $1700 FOR THIS REPAIR BEFORE DISCOUNTS.  I ASKED THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN IF THIS IS A COMMON REPAIR, HE SAID, \"YES, WE DO A LOT OF THESE.\"  I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS REPAIR TO THE POINT THAT IT APPEARS TO BE A RELIABILITY ISSUE.  USING THE FMEA APPROACH - SEVERITY IS HIGH TO THE FACT THAT  WITHOUT GEAR FLUID THE TRANSFER CASE WILL CEASE AND CAUSE CATASTROPHIC FAILURE.  THIS TYPE OF FAILURE IS NOT DETECTABLE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF NORMAL USER MAINTENANCE.  THE FLUID CAN ONLY BE CHECKED BY A MECHANIC FROM THE UNDERSIDE OF THE VEHICLE AND NOT FROM THE TOP OF THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT (I.E. DIPSTICK).  OCCURRENCE OR FREQUENCY APPEARS TO BE COMMON PER THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN'S COMMENTS.      I AM REQUESTING THAT THE NHTSA INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE.  I SUSPECT OTHER CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THIS KNOW DEFECT (BAD SEAL).",
