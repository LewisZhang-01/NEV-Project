HOWEVER, I DON'T FEEL \"SAFE\" IN THE CAR AND FEEL THE PART IS FAULTY AND SHOULD BE RECALLED BY MANUFACTURER. BRAKES HAVE SINCE HESITATED ON TWO OCCASIONS WHILE STOPPING. THERE WERE NO BRAKES FOR A SPLIT SECOND AND THEN THE BRAKES SLOWLY (2-3 SECONDS) REGAINED POWER AND CONTROL OF THE CAR. NUMEROUS OTHER OWNERS HAVE ENCOUNTERED THE SAME PROBLEM AS THE DEALER (SUPERIOR VOLVO) STATED THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR THIS MODEL. *JB",
