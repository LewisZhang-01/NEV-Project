ON DECEMBER 16, 2002, MY GTI WITH ONLY 5200 MILES STARTED RUMBLING AND SHAKING VIOLENTLY WHILE BEING DRIVEN IN A COLD MORNING. THE ''CHECK ENGINE'' LIGHT BEGAN FLASHING, AND THE CAR LOST POWER AND WAS UNABLE TO ACCELERATE.  I RESEARCHED AND I FOUND COUNTLESS VW AND AUDI OWNERS WHO HAD EXPERIENCED THE SAME FAILURES ON THEIR VEHICLES WITH THE 1.8T ENGINE ON MORE THAN ONE IGNITION COIL.   THE CAR SAT IN THE DEALERS' LOT FOR MORE THAN TWO WEEKS WAITING FOR AN IGNITION COIL THAT WAS ON NATIONAL BACKORDER.",
