THE DEALER FOUND NO INITIAL PROBLEMS.  2/5/2003--RECEIVED NOTICE IN THE MAIL FROM AUDI CONCERNING THE POSSIBILITY OF BAD COIL PACKS ON 2002 A4'S.  2/7/2003--THE CAR STALLED ON US AT NIGHT, IN THE RAIN, IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY INTERSECTION.  IT TOOK ME AT LEAST A MINUTE TO GET IT RESTARTED--THAT MAY NOT SOUND LIKE MUCH, BUT YOU SHOULD TRY TURNING OFF YOUR CAR IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION AND WAIT 60 SECONDS BEFORE RESTARTING & TAKING OFF.  SEE HOW MAY PEOPLE START HONKING AND/OR ALMOST HIT YOU BEFORE YOU MOVE....  2/8-2/11/03--THE DEALER CHECKS THE CAR OVER.  THEY SAY THE COIL PACKS ARE FINE, BUT THE MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR WAS BAD, SO THEY REPLACED IT.  I DON'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE FIXED THE PROBLEM, SINCE THE CAR STILL IDLES ROUGH, AND STILL HAS TROUBLE STARTING.  LUCKILY, IT HASN'T DIED ON US AGAIN (YET).   *NLM",
