THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A BEAUTIFUL CAR, SO FUN TO DRIVE WITH THE TOP DOWN BUT THE DINGS AND DENTS ARE EVERYWHERE!  LOOKS LIKE A WASHBOARD!  ALSO, SEVERAL PROBLEMS WITH ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.   CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON ALL THE TIME AND THE DEALER SAYS THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH IT!  TRY TELLING THAT TO THE PERSON YOU'RE SELLING THE CAR TOO!  ALSO, FOR SUCH AN EXPENSIVE CAR, YOU'D THINK THEY'D MAKE THE CONVERTABLE TOP TO LAST LONGER. IN BOTH OF THE SEBRINGS I OWNED THE CLOTH TOP HAD TO BE REPLACED WITHIN THE FIRST 3 YEARS!",
