        "summary": "I HAVE A 1997 BUICK CENTURY WITH WINDSHIELD WIPER PROBLEMS.  BY WAY OF HISTORY, I HAVE HAD TO TAKE THIS VEHICLE TO THE SHOP TWICE (AND I BELIEVE POSSIBLY A THIRD TIME) BECAUSE THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WOULD NOT FUNCTION.  EACH TIME, THE PROBLEM RELATED TO SOME FITTING THAT HAD TO BE RETIGHTENED (I WAS NEVER SHOWN THE PRECISE PART BY THE REPAIR PERSONNEL).  NOW, ALTHOUGH THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WILL WORK PROPERLY IN THE RAIN, WHEN THEY ARE TURNED OFF, THEY GO TO THE UPRIGHT POSITION, OBSCURING THE WINDSHIELD.  I HAVE LEARNED TODAY, FROM THE NHTSA WEBSITE AND SIMILAR SOURCES, THAT THESE PROBLEMS ARE WELL KNOWN TO BUICK.  UPON REFLECTION, AND WITH 20-20 HINDSIGHT, I BELIEVE IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT THIS PROBLEM IS CAUSED BY THE EXCESSIVE TORQUE GENERATED BY THE  WIPER MOTOR AT ITS HIGHEST SETTING (WHEN SET AT THE TOP SETTING, THE WIPERS GENERATE SO MUCH FORCE, THEY CAUSE THE ENTIRE VEHICLE TO SHAKE).  *NLM",
