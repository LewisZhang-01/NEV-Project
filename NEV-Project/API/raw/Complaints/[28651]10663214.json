AFTER SEVERAL CALLS AND DAYS OF TRYING TO SET AN APPOINTMENT, I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL SAYING THAT I WILL BE CONTACTED FOR AN APPOINTMENT SOON. THIS WAS OVER 2 WEEKS AGO.  I LIVE IN MIAMI, WHERE THE CHANCES OF THE  AIRBAG MALFUNCTIONING IS GREATER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE STATES. I DRIVE IN FEAR EACH DAY THAT MY AIRBAG WILL GO OFF, KILLING ME AND MY FAMILY.  IT SEEMS THAT THESE DEALERSHIPS AND HONDA ONLY CARE ABOUT CAR SALES, BUT DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS, WHEN THEIR PRODUCT HAS DEFECTS.  *TR",
