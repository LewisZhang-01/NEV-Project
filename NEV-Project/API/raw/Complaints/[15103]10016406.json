I CALLED EVERY HONDA DEALER IN SAN DIEGO AND WAS TOLD THIS IS NORMAL. AFTER THEY FIRST DENIED HAVING ANYONE ELSE COMPLAIN OF THIS. FINALLY A SERVICE ADVISOR ADMITTED THEY ARE TRYING TO FIX THE NON-EXISTING PROBLEM.  I HAVE OWNED MANY HONDA'S AND NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM. THE SOLUTION AT THIS TIME IS TO HAVE THE BRAKE CALIPERS LUBED FOR THE SHORT TERM BUT THE NOISE WILL COME BACK. HONDA IS APPARENTLY TRYING TO REDESIGN THE SPRINGS ON THE CALIPERS SO UNTIL THEN  HAPPY CLUNKING.",
