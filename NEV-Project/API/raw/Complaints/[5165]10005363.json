REVVED CAR TO TRY TO 'CLEAR' SYSTEM.  PROBLEM CONTINUED, AT WORST WHEN IDLING.  AFTER A FEW MINUTES, ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, SO I TURNED OFF THE CAR AND CALLED FORD DEALER.  WRECKER DRIVER CAME OUT, REVVED CAR A FEW MORE TIMES (APPROX. 3000 RPM) SMALL BACKFIRE OUT OF MUFFLER EACH TIME.  PROBLEM SEEMED TO GO AWAY.  WRECKER DRIVER BLAMED 'BAFFLES' IN MUFFLER?  DROVE CAR ANOTHER 200 MILES HOME.  THREE DAYS LATER, AFTER DRIVING A BIT, PARKED FOR SHORT TIME THEN RESTARTED CAR, SAME PROBLEM REOCCURRED.",
