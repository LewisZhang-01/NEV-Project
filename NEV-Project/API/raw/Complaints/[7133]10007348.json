        "summary": "POWER STEERING PUMP WAS LEAKING VERY BADLY. WE TOOK IT TO THE BYERS CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP AT 390 EAST BROAD STREET, (614) 228-5111 WE COULD SEE THAT A BOLT/NUT HAD RUBBED A HOLE THROUGH THE POWER STEERING LINE. THE DEALER MECHANIC TOLD US AFTER CHECKING IT THAT WE MUST HAVE RUN OVER SOMETHING BECAUSE THERE WAS A HOLE IN THE LINE AND PROCEEDED TO LET US KNOW THAT THE  REPLACEMENT PART IS ON BACK-ORDER FOR UP TO 6 MONTHS. THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED OBVIOUSLY BY LOOKING AT THE PART FROM THE NUT/BOLT RUBBING AGAINST THE LINE. THE DEALER DID NOT OFFER TO PATCH IT UP OR ANY ASSISTANCE. WHEN CALLING AROUND TO SEVERAL OTHER DODGE DEALERS, I INFORMED THAT THIS PARTICULAR PART HAS BEEN RENAMED AND NUMBERED DUE TO A PROBLEM IN PREVIOUS MODELS AND IS ON BACKORDER NATIONWIDE BUT IT WAS NEVER RECALLED. THE NEW PART NUMBER IS 05101846AA. WE NOW HAVE A LEAKING POWER STEERING PUMP AND NO ANSWERS OR ASSISTANCE FROM THE DEALERSHIP. WE HAVE A WARRANTY BUT IT SUPPOSEDLY IT IS NOT COVERED. WE WOULD APPRECIATE ANY AND ALL ASSISTANCE YOU CAN PROVIDE. THANK YOU.    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**767681",
