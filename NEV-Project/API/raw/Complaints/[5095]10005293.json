THE CAR DOES NOT RESPOND PROPERLY WHEN TRAVELING AT LOW SPEEDS AND ARE REQUIRED TO MOVE THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL TO MAKE SLIGHT SPEED ADJUSTMENTS. THIS IS THE SAME PROBLEM DESCRIBED FOR 1996 HONDA CIVIC. I HAVE IT ON MY 1997 CIVIC. HONDA WILL NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM ON MY 1997 CIVIC. I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFTEY HAZARD. IF THE THROTTLE CABLE STICKING PROBLEM BECOMES WORSE, IT COULD CAUSE THE THROTTLE TO STICK WIDE OPEN.",
