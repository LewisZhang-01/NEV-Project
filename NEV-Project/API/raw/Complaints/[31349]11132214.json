THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC IN THE LANE I WAS CROSSING OVER FOR THE TURN HAD TO BRAKE SUDDENLY BECAUSE MY CAR DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE INTERSECTION FAST ENOUGH. I WAS TOLD THAT MY TURBO BOOST WAS BAD. I HAVE A 2012 ECO BOOST MODEL AND IT WAS CLASSIFIED AS 'UNDER BOOST' WHICH WASN'T ALLOWING MY CAR TO ACCELERATE PROPERLY AND WOULD EVENTUALLY GIVE OUT COMPLETELY NOT ALLOWING ME TO ACCELERATE AT ALL.",
