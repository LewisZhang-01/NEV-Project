AT TIMES MY CAR WILL DRIVE AT A NORMAL SPEED AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WILL BE ON .ITS VERY STRANGE.    I'VE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT IT NEEDED A NEW CATALYTIC CONVERTER. IT WAS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY. ONE WEEK LATER THE SAME SYMPTOMS AND ANOTHER OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE OF OVER $1,000.00 AND ANOTHER PART. THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS MONTHS LATER. EACH TIME WITH A DIFFERENT DIAGNOSIS BY THE DEALER.  MY MECHANIC DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENED WITH HIS METER AND IT READ ELECTRONIC THROTTLE BODY. I TOLD THIS TO THE DEALER MONTHS AGO AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AGO.  *TR",
