        "summary": "I PURCHASED MY 2012 CHEVY CRUZE BACK IN AUGUST 2012 AT THE CHEVY DEALER IN MONTEBELLO WITH \"0\" MILES. TWO WEEKS AFTER I PURCHASED THE CAR IT BEGAN TO GIVE ME PROBLEMS.  IT BEGAN TO MAKE THIS VERY LOUD NOISE LIKE IF I WAS DRIVING A TRAILER. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AN I WAS TOLD IT WAS NORMAL WHICH IS BS BECAUSE I'VE NEVER HEARD A SMALL CAR THAT MAKES NOISE LIKE THAT. I WASN'T ALLOWED TO GET REFUNDED I WAS JUST GIVEN A BUNCH OF BS.   A MONTH LATER IT KEPT DOING THE SAME THING BUT THIS TIME THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM THE HOOD, TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND NOTHING. 3RD TIME I FILED A COMPLAINT AND SAID I WAS GOING TO FILE A LAWSUIT AND THE TOOK MY CAR IN AN APPARENTLY THEY HAD TO CHANGE MY RADIATOR, FAN, BRAKES ALONG WITH THE DISK. EVEN AFTER ALL THIS MY CAR CONTINUED DOING THE SAME THING BUT NOW IT TURNS OFF!! I TRIED TO TURN ON MY CAR THIS SATURDAY AND IT JUST WOULDN'T START. IT SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THEFT, I DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY AND THEN IT GAVE A MESSAGE ABOUT CHECK POWER STEERING! THIS WILL BE MY 5TH TIME TAKING IT IN!   I THINK I HAVE GOTTEN RIPPED OFF!! I REGRET PURCHASING THIS VEHICLE!! NOW IM STUCK WITH A JACKED UP CAR AND A VERY HIGH CAR PAYMENT THAT IS NOT EVEN WORTH PAYING FOR. AND TO TOP IT OFF THE DEALER I PURCHASED IT FROM IS NO HELP!! THEY SEEM TO GET UPSET EVERY TIME YOU TAKE THE CAR AND TELL THEM THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT. IM A MOTHER OF 3 AND MY BIGGEST FEAR IS SOMETHING HAPPENING TO MY CHILDREN BECAUSE OF THIS. I PURCHASE THIS CAR BECAUSE I NEEDED SOMETHING RELIABLE SINCE IM ALWAYS ON THE ROAD. ONE THING FOR SURE, IF ANY OF MY CHILDREN GET HURT BECAUSE OF THIS I WILL FILE A LAWSUIT BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE RECEIVING MANY COMPLAINTS AND YOU ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT.!!  *TR",
