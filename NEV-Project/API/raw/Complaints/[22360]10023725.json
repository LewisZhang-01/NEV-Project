THIS WAS ONLY DONE AT MY INSISTENCE.  NISSAN'S PUBLISHED (SEE THEIR TSB) APPROACH IS TO DISMOUNT TIRES AND ROTATE SIDE TO SIDE.  NOW AT ~6,000 MILES AND NEW TIRES ARE CUPPING.  VEHICLE ALSO SUFFERS FROM A SEVERE PURPOSING (BOUNCE) PROBLEM THAT PARTICULARLY MANIFESTS ITSELF ON CONCRETE ROADWAYS.  AT HIGHWAY SPEED IT IS SO SEVERE THAT THE CAR FEELS AS THOUGH IT IS BECOMING AIRBORNE.  NISSAN HAS NOT, OF YET, ADDRESSED EITHER OF THESE PROBLEMS WITH A PERMANENT FIX.  *JB",
