WE GET SEVERE WHEEL HOP AND WHEN WE STOP THE VEHICLE, THEN RESTART IT THERE IS A VERY LOUD CLUNKING SOUND. AFTER THAT THE VEHICLE PREFORMS NORMALLY. THE PROBLEM ALSO GOES AWAY IF THE VEHICLE IS TURNED OFF. THE VEHICLE GOES INTO 4 WHEEL AUTO, 4 WHEEL LOW AND 2 WHEEL HIGH NORMALLY AT ALL OTHER TIMES. AGAIN, THE PROBLEM ONLY HAPPENS WHEN THE ANTILOCK BRAKES ARE ACTIVATED AT LOW SPEEDS (NO PROBLEM FROM HIGH SPEED STOPS) AND IT HAS HAPPENED TWICE IN THE PAST 5 MINTHS.",
