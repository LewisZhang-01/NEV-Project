THE REAR BRAKES HAVE SHOWN ONLY MODERATE WEAR I FEEL THAT THIS INDICATES A SEVERE IMBALANCE IN THE BRAKING BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR BRAKES. ALSO, THE FRONT ROTORS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED DO TO SEVERE RUST. THIS CAUSED THE ROTORS TO DELAMINATE. THIS APPEARS TO BE A QUALITY ISSUE WITH THE ROTORS.*JB",
