        "summary": "ACCORDING TO THE MECHANIC WORKING ON MY 1999 DODGE INTREPID, THE POWER BRAKE BOOSTER IS DEFECTIVE.  CURRENTLY, WHEN THE CAR SITS IN TEMPATURES BELOW 32 DEGREES FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS, THERE IS ALMOST COMPLETE LOSS OF BRAKE PRESSURE DUE TO AIR BEING ALLOWED INTO THE SYSTEM BECAUSE OF A HAIRLINE CRACK IN THE UNIT.  WHEN THE CAR HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO WARM UP (15-20 MINUTES) AND/OR THE TEMPATURE IS ABOVE 32 DEGREES, THE BRAKE PRESSURE IS FINE AS NO AIR IS BEING ALLOWED INTO THE SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE EXPANSION OF A SEAL IN THE UNIT.   WHEN THE MECHANIC CALLED HIS AUTO-PARTS DEALER FOR A PART, HE WAS TOLD IT WAS ONLY AVAILABLE FROM DODGE DIRECTLY.  WHEN HE CALLED DODGE, HE WAS TOLD THE PART WAS ON NATIONAL BACKORDER AND COULD NOT EVEN BE GIVEN AN ESTIMATED DATE OF WHEN THE PART WOULD BECOME AVAILABLE.   IF THERE IS THIS BIG OF A DEMAND FOR THE PART, OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM.  I NOTICED ONLINE THAT THERE WAS A RECALL OF 2000 AND 2001 NEONS FOR BRAKE BOOSTER PROBLEMS, WHY NOT FOR THE OTHER DODGE CARS?",
