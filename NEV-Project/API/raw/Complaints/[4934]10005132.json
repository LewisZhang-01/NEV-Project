ON ONE OCCASION, THE CAR ACCELERATED BY ITSELF.  ON ANOTHER, THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO RUN AFTER THE KEY WAS REMOVED FROM THE CAR.  ON ANOTHER, THE CAR REPROGRAMMED THE KEYS AND WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO START THE CAR.  ON TWO OCCASIONS THE CAR'S ENGINE STOPPED WHILE PUTTING THE CAR INTO REVERSE.  AUDI IN MIAMI, FL AND IN ALEXANDRIA, VA HAVE FAILED TO FIND THE CAUSE OF THESE PROBLEMS AND HAVE \"NEVER HEARD\" OF SUCH COMPLAINTS.  DESPITE THESE PROBLEMS, AUDI CONSUMER RELATIONS REFUSES TO REPLACE THE CAR AND THEREFORE, I AM FORCED TO FILE UNDER FLORIDA LEMON LAW.  THIS IS A DISGRACE ON BEHALF OF AUDI AND BECAUSE OF THESE PROBLEMS AND AUDI ON THE CORPORATE LEVEL, I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER AUDI NOR RECOMMEND IT TO ANYBODY ELSE.  *JB",
