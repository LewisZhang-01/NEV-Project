THE CAR HAS BEEN IN THIS CONDITION SINCE FEBRUARY 2002, WHEN IT BEGAN RUNNING HOT.  THE CHRYSLER DEALER SAID THAT IT NEEDED AN ENGINE AND ALSO COOLING FAN COMPONENTS.  THIS CAR IS LESS THAN FIVE YEARS OLD AND LESS THEN 65,000 MILES, THERE IS NO REASON THAT A WELL MADE CAR SHOULD NEED AN ENGINE AT THIS POINT.  FROM JUST THE COMPLAINTS ON NHTSA'S SITE OF OTHER CONSUMER COMPLAINTS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM, THE ENGINE SHOULD BE RECALLED, AND FIXED BY CHRYSLER.     *TT",
