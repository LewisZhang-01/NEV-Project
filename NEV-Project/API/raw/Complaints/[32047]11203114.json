I ALSO HAD A FEW INSTANCES WHERE THE VEHICLE WOULD RANDOMLY NOT GO OVER 40 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY (POSSIBLY THE VEHICLE IS GOING INTO SOME KIND OF FAIL SAFE MODE) AND WOULD REV HEAVILY. I REACHED OUT TO NISSAN AND THEY ADVISED IT SOUNDS LIKE A CVT TRANSMISSION PROBLEM, WHICH IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH A LOT OF THE NISSAN VEHICLES. HOWEVER, THEY HAVE NOT CREATED A RECALL FOR THE 2013 NISSAN SENTRA AND ADVISED THEY DO NOT PLAN TO DO SO. *DT    *JS*JB",
