DEALERSHIP REPLACES WINDOW ASSEMBLY AND SAYS THEY \"GOODWILL\" IT TO ME WITH NO CHARGE - EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CHARGED IN THE FIRST PLACE.  DEALERSHIP DOES NOT HAVE PART IN STOCK AND I HAVE TO DRIVE WITH A TRASHBAG TAPED WHERE MY WINDOW SHOULD BE IN RAINY WEATHER DURING MY 30-MILE (ONE-WAY) ALL HIGHWAY COMMUTE TO AND FROM WORK.  THE ONLY WINDOW I EVER OPERATE NOW IS MY DRIVER SIDE WINDOW AND ONLY AS NECESSARY.  VERY COSTLY AND DANGEROUS WINDOW SITUATION.",
