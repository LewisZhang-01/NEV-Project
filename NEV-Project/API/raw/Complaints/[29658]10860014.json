MY CAR WILL NOT PASS INSPECTION BECAUSE THIS CAR IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE. MY HUSBAND CONTACTED CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WE WERE INFORMED THAT THIS YEAR IS NOT RECALLED SO BASICALLY THERE'S NOTHING THEY'RE WILLING TO DO. IF  THE 2007 WAS RECALLED AND THE WARRANTY WAS EXTENDED FOR THE SAME PROBLEM, WHY IS MY 2009 CROSS MEMBER RUSTED OUT? BECAUSE THE SAME PARTS WERE USED AND DEALERSHIPS NEVER WARNED CUSTOMERS THAT THIS WAS A HUGE AND EXPENSIVE PROBLEM ON THESE VEHICLES. WHAT HAPPENED TO SATISFIED CUSTOMERS???  I'M LIVID ABOUT THIS. 8 MONTHS AGO BEFORE MY VEHICLE HAD 50X MILES ON IT, THE TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED. AND THIS CAR ISN'T A PIECE OF CRAP RIGHT? MADE IN CHINA??  I CAN'T BELIEVE THE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT CHRYSLER UTILIZES. SO ARE THEY WAITING FOR A CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENT THAT KILLS SOMEBODY BEFORE THEY ARE WILING TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. WE WERE TOLD WHEN WE CALLED THAT \"THERE'S NOT ENOUGH COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE THAT WOULD WARRANT A RECALL.\"  REALLY????  SO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE IS I'M GOING TO CONTACT MY ATTORNEY AND CONTACT THE LOCAL NEWS. I AM DEFINITELY NOT THE 1ST PERSON WITH THIS SAME ISSUE AND SAFETY DEFECT. CHRYSLER WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND FIX YOUR PROBLEM WITH THESE VEHICLES BEFORE THEY TAKE THE LIFE OF INNOCENT PEOPLE??? I'M DISGUSTED BEYOND BELIEF!! CAN YOU TELL???",
