        "summary": "TRAVELING ON THE HIGHWAY AT 55 MILES PER HOUR AND THE ENTIRE ENGINE STALLED AND CUT OFF. I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A LOCAL SHOP WHERE THEY TOLD ME THAT 3 OUT OF THE 6 COILS BASICALLY WERE NOT WORKING AND THE PCM/COMPUTER WAS COMPLETELY SHOT, THEY WANTED OVER $1600 AT DEALERSHIP TO FIX THIS. FORD HAD APPARENTLY DISTRIBUTED A BULLETIN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM TO THE DEALERSHIPS BUT NOT THEIR CUSTOMERS - WHO THIS PROBLEM AFFECTS THE MOST. I WAS LUCKY THAT I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND NOT HIT ANYONE OR GET KILLED. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MANY PEOPLE THIS HAS AFFECTED BECAUSE IT IS ALL OVER THE INTERNET. THE REPAIR ENDED UP COSTING WELL OVER $1000 BECAUSE OF THE SPARK PLUGS THAT FORD KNEW WERE FAULTY YEARS AGO. A SIMPLE CHANGING OF THE SPARK PLUGS INSTEAD OF SIX COILS. I SEE NO DIFFERENCE IN GM HAVING TO RECALL VEHICLES THAT SHUT OFF ON THE HIGHWAY AND FORD HAVING TO RECALL THESE VEHICLES FOR BASICALLY THE SAME REASON AND REIMBURSE THEIR CUSTOMERS, OUR CARS ARE SHUTTING OFF TOO.  *TR",
