        "summary": "ON JUNE 22, 2002 I WAS DIRVING MY CAR TO WV.  HALF WAY THERE THE TRANSMISSION 'POPPED' OUT OF 5TH GEAR.  I PULLED OFF AT THE NEXT EXIT IN SEARCH OF ASSISTANCE WHERE I FOUND THE TRANSMISSION WOULD NOT REMAIN IN 3RD GEAR EITHER.   IN THIS SMALL TOWN I WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANYONE WHO COULD/WOULD LOOK AT MY CAR SO I PROCEEDED TO CHARLESTON WHERE MY DAD AND A COUSIN WHO COULD LOOK AT MY CAR WERE.  IT WAS FOUND THAT MY TRANSMISSION HAD NO FLUID IN IT - SO THIS WAS REPLACED WITH FLUID AS CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL AS POSSIBLE SO WE COULD GET BACK TO RICHMOND.  ALL 360 MILES I HAD TO DRIVE HOLDING MY GEAR SHIFT INTO 5TH GEAR OR 3RD GEAR WHEN NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE IT HOME.      THE DEALERSHIP WAS WONDERFUL!  THEY SAID MY CLUTCH CABLE WAS BROKEN AND I HAD SEVERAL OIL LEAKS!  THEY REPAIRED EVERYTHING AND IT WAS ALL COVERED UNDER THE POWER TRAIN WARRENTY.  THANK YOU FOR THAT WARRENTY!  MY CAR ONLY HAD A LITTLE OVER 40,000 MILES AT THE TIME.",
