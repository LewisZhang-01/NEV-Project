THIS KIND OF SCENARIO HAPPENED TWICE BEFORE ( ON LOCAL STREETS WHILE DRIVING AROUND 20 MILES PER HOUR). I FELT THAT THIS CAR'S BRAKE SYSTEM WAS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE OTHER CARS I OWNED BEFORE. SHOULDN'T THE ANTI-BRAKE SYSTEM HELP THE CAR STAY STRAIGHT ON THE ROAD? ON 09-20-2002, IT WAS RAINING,  I DROVE THIS CAR ON THE HIGHWAY AT THE SPEED AROUND 50 MILES PER HOUR, ON THE FIRST LEFT LANE. AFTER I APPLIED THE BRAKE IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE SPEED FURTHER, MY CAR WENT TO THE RIGHT SIDE, AND THEN LEFT SIDE, AND THEN CRASHED TO THE MIDDLE CONCRETE.  *PH  *JB    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**768012",
