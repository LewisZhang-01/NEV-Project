MY CAR DOES NOT HAVE A MATCHING VIN SO THE DEALER SAYS I AM NOT COVERED.  IF IT WERE A DEFECTIVE PART I COULD UNDERSTAND THEM BEING ABLE TO CLASSIFY MY CAR AS HAVING PASSED.  HOWEVER, SINCE THIS WAS A PROCEDURE, I DO NOT THINK THAT WITH THE # OF COMPLAINTS SIMILAR TO MINE THAT THEY HAVE COVERED ALL THE CARS THEY SHOULD HAVE.  IS MITSUBISHI NOT NOTORIOUS FOR LETTING THE VOLUME OF COMPLAINTS ESCALATE TO UNREASONABLE AMOUNTS PRIOR TO ACTING??  *JB",
