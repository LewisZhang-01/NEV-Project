        "summary": "I HAVE AN 05 MINI COOPER S AND THE POWER STEERING PUMP IS DEFECTIVE ALONG WITH 80,000+ OTHERS. I AM ROUGHLY AROUND 90,000 MILES AND THE PUMP HAS JUST RECENTLY STARED GOING OUT DUE TO WHAT THE DEALERSHIP CALLED A \"DEFECTIVE LEAK ON THE ACTUALLY BODY OF THE PUMP\". I ASKED THEM WHAT I SHOULD DO AND THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME $1100 TO \"FIX IT\" BUT SAID THAT IT COULD GO OUT AND FAIL AT ANYTIME WHILE I AM DRIVING. THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE BECAUSE MY WIFE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE CAR IF IT COULD GO OUT AT ANYTIME? THEY ALSO SAID THAT THIS WAS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM IN 04/05 MINI COOPERS. I REALLY WISH SOMEBODY WOULD MAKE THEM RECALL THIS POTENTIAL LIFE THREATENING PROBLEM WITHOUT CHARGING US $1100 FOR THEIR MISTAKE IN DESIGNING/INSTALLING THE POWER STEERING PUMPS???   *TR",
