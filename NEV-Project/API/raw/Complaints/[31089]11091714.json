THEY EXTENDED THE WARRANTY COVERAGE ON THE TRANSMISSION BUT ONLY FOR \"SPECIFICALLY TERMED\" ISSUES. MY CLUTCH AND SEALS HAVE BEEN REPLACED TWICE, THE TCM HAS BEEN REPROGRAMMED 3 TIMES AND NOW THEY NOW TELL ME I NEED TO REPLACE THE \"J AND K\" FORKS, SNAP RING AND T/O BEARING IN THE TRANSMISSION. BUT, THEY TELL ME NONE OF THIS IS COVERED. THEY OPENED UP AND SERVICED A \"SEALED\" TRANSMISSION AT LEAST TWICE ALREADY AND THE CAR IS DOING THE SAME THING THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM, SHUDDERING, JERKING AND NO POWER BUT NOW I HAVE TO PAY. JUST GETTING IT TO THE DEALERSHIP I WAS ALMOST IN 2 ACCIDENTS BECAUSE OF THIS CARS ERRATIC ACCELERATION DRIVING BEHAVIOR.",
