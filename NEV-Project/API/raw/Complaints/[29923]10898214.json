I HAVE DONE MY RESEARCH, AND HAVE FOUND THAT A MANUFACTURER MUST REPAIR, REPLACE, OR SUPPLY A NEW VEHICLE TO THE OWNER WHEN A RECALL IS MANDATED.  I HAVE TAKEN MY VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR EACH RECALL, AND WHAT THEY DO IS INSPECT THE VEHICLE, AND IN MOST CASES, TELL ME MY CAR DOESN'T APPLY TO THE RECALL AS THEY FIND NOTHING WRONG.  I AM DISTURBED BY THIS BECAUSE AGAIN, EVERYTHING I HAVE READ, EVERYONE I HAVE TALKED TO, ETC ... TELLS ME THAT THE DEALER MUST DO SOMETHING IN ORDER FOR THE RECALL TO BE CONSIDERED COMPLETE.  I AM DRIVING AROUND IN A VEHICLE WITH THINGS WRONG WITH IT, TRANSPORTING A TODDLER, AND AM STUCK WITH FINDING RESOLUTION ON MY OWN.  HOW IS THIS FAIR TO THE CONSUMER?  THE MANUFACTURER HAS ALL OF ITS MONEY, AS MY CAR IS PAID OFF, AND MY CAR ISN'T WORTH ANYTHING FOR TRADE OR RESELL DUE TO NEGLIGENCE.  IF I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE BY FILING A COMPLAINT, AND POSSIBLY SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE, I AM WILLING TO TRY EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING IN MY POWER TO DO SO.",
