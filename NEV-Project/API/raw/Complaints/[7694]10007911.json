THE COST OF REPAIRING THIS IS BETWEEN $120.00 AND $140.00. THIS IS HAZARDOUS BECAUSE THE WIPERS STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDSHIELD AND OBSTRUCTS THE DRIVER' VISION. I HAVE CONTACTED PONTIAC NUMEROUS TIMES CONCERNING THIS PROBLEM BUT TO NO AVAIL. MANY OTHER OWNERS OF THIS STYLE OF AUTOMOBILE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.",
