THIS EVEN HAPPENED WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON AN ICY ROAD.  THE DEALER SAID THAT THIS IS NORMAL.  ALL THE VEHICLE'S LOCKS WOULD LOCK AND UNLOCK BY THEMSELVES, SOMETIMES LOCKING MY KEYS IN IT BEFORE I CAN GET THEM OUT.  THREE MONTHS AFTER THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED IT WAS RETURNED TO THE DEALER BECAUSE THE HEATER AND AIR DID NOT WORK PROPERLY.  A FIRE BURNED THE DRIVER'S DOOR, SEAT, FLOOR RUGS AND WINDOW.  THE FIREMAN SAID IT WAS AN ELECTRICAL FIRE, WHICH STARTED IN THE DRIVER'S DOOR BY THE WIRES.  THE FIRE HAPPENED ON THE WEEKEND THEREFORE THE DEALER IS NOT AWARE OF THE FIRE YET.  I PLAN TO GO TO THE DEALER ON MONDAY TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE.  THE VEHICLE CANNOT BE DRIVEN AND THE SMELL INSIDE THE VEHICLE IS OVERWHELMING.  EVERYTHING ON DRIVERS SIDE IS BURNED.  I WILL ASK FOR A NEW REPLACEMENT VEHICLE.   *NM",
