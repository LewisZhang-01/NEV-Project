        "summary": "THERE IS EXCESSIVE ENGINE NOISE, THAT THE DEALERSHIP HAS SAID IS ENGINE LIFTERS. ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP  GM HAS DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS AN OIL PUMP ISSUE. THEY SAY THAT SUFFICIENT OIL IS NOT PUMPED TO THE ENGINE, SO THERE IS A LACK OF LUBRICATION. THE RESULT IS A TYPICAL \"LIFTER STICKING\" NOISE. THE DEALER SAYS THAT GM HAS NOT ISSUED ANY SORT OF A RECALL YET! IN FACT THEY SAY THERE IS NOT AN ADVERSE EFFECT OR DAMAGED BEING CAUSED TO THE ENGINE. I FIND THIS HARD TO BELIEVE AS PROPER LUBRICATION IS CRUCIAL TO MOTOR LONGEVITY. I BELIEVE THIS IS A RECALL ISSUE, AND THE LONG GM WAITS TO DIAGNOSE AND RECALL THIS PROBLEM, DAMAGE TO THIS VEHICLE WILL ONLY WORSEN. IF ALL ALLOWED TO GO LONG ENOUGH, I WOULD THINK GM WOULD BE LOOKING AT HAVING TO REPLACE MOTOR BLOCKS, RATHER THAN INSTALLING AN OIL PUMP THAT CAN HANDLE THE TASK OF GETTING OIL TO THE CRANK CASE. *TS    *NLM  ****DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12-12-02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS****761983",
