ON NOV. 5, 2001 THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, THE DASH DISPLAYED EMISSION WORKSHOP.THE SYSMPTOMS WERE A JOLTING WHEN PLACING THE CAR INTO ANY GEAR AND THE CAR LOSING POWER FOR SEVERAL SECONDS WHILE DRIVING.I TOOK IT IN AND FOUND OUT THE \"ENGINE CONTROL MODULE\" NEEDED REPLACMENT &  THE \"MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR\"   NEEDED TO BE REPLACED  AND IT WAS FIXED AT NO CHARGE. THEN, ON DEC. 23, 2002 I HAD THE SAME SYMPTOMS AND TOOK IT IN AND HAD TOPAY $161.00 TO REPLACE THE \"VACCUM LINE TO MANIFOLD\". NOW YESTERDAY APRIL 28,2003 I HAD THE SAME SYMPTOMS AND FOUND OUT THE \"MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR\" NEEDS TO BE REPLACED  FOR THE SEONCD TIME AND THE DEALER WILL ONLY PAY 50% AND THEY WILL STAND BEHIND THEIR DECISION BECAUSE THEY FEEL IT'S MORE THEN FAIR. THE DEALER HAS TOLD ME THAT IT IS VERY RARE FOR THIS PROBLEM TO HAPPEN. WELL IT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED 3 TIMES IN THE 3 YEARS I HAVE OWNED IT AND THEY ARE UNABLE TO GIVE ME AN ANSWER TO WHY THIS HAPPENS.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW MAY COMPLAINTS YOU HAVE RECEIVED ON CASE NUMBER:748685. I FEEL LIKE I PURCHASED A LEMON AND WILL BE DEALING WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM OVER AND OVER. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE OR RECOMMEND A VOLKSWAGEN TO ANYONE.",
