        "summary": "I OWN A 2002 SPORT TRAC, AT ABOUT 46000 MILES MI TRANSMISSION STARTED TO MISS SHIFTS FROM 2ND TO 3RD GEAR, IT TOOK ABOUT 3 TO 4 SECONDS FOR THE TRANSMISSION TO GET INTO THE NEXT GEAR, SO I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER WHERE I USUALLY HAVE THE TRUCK SERVICED THINKING THAT IT JUST NEEDED A FLUID CHECK DUE TO THE FACT THEY PERFORMED A TRANSMISSION FLUID CHANGE AT ABOUT 30000. WHEN I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER I WAS ADVISED THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAD A PROBLEM ON THE FLUID LINES AND THE TRANSMISSION HAD TO BE TAKEN OUT TO BE REBUILT, SO I ASKED WHY WAS THIS HAPPENING AND THEY STATED THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE GASKETS BEEN WORN OUT INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION.  BUT THEY COULDN'T SPECIFY IF THIS WAS A FACTORY PROBLEM OR A OWNER ABUSE PROBLEM, SO WHEN I ASKED IF THERE WAS A TRANSMISSION RECALL BY THE MANUFACTURER (FORD) ON THIS TYPE OF TRUCKS THE ANSWER WAS NO. THEN I WAS ADVISED THAT MY TRUCK WAS OUT OF FACTORY WARRANTY WHICH IS 3 YEARS OR 36000 MILES AND IF I WANTED TO HAVE THE JOB DONE IT HAD TO BE SELF FINANCED, SO I ASKED FOR AN ESTIMATE WHICH WAS ABOUT 18 HOURS LABOR @ $100 P/H AND $500 IN PARTS TOTALING $2300 AND FINALLY AFTER CALLING FORD AND COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS  $30000 TRUCK HAVING A FAULTY TRANSMISSION AND GETTING A \"YOUR TRUCK IS OUT OF WARRANTY, AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER TRUCKS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM\" I FINALLY PAID THE REPAIRS OUT OF MY POCKET WHICH I PERSONALLY THINK SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING ON A ALMOST BRAND NEW TRUCK.  *JB",
