        "summary": "SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON ALWAYS I TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO TAKE INTO THE DEALER AND THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING BAD THE LIGHT REMAINED.  ON DECEMBER 2005 THE CAR STARTED RUNNING WRONG WAS TURNING OFF SOME TIMES IN THE STREET AND FINALLY WAS BROKEN I HAD TO PAY TOW AND EVERYTHING TO FIX IT AND THE ENGINE FAILED. THE MECHANIC ASSUMED THAT THE CAR HAD OVERHEATED BUT I DIDN'T THINK SO.  BECAUSE THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN USED JUST TO DO SHORT RUNS CLOSE TO MY HOUSE AND THE TEMPERATURE NEEDLE NEVER WENT UP AND IT WAS WORKING PROPERLY.  ANY WAY I HAD TO PAY  TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND THE DEALER SAID THAT EVERYTHING WAS WORKING PROPERLY, THE SENSOR WAS OK BUT TEN DAYS AFTER THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME BACK THE CAR IS STILL THERE.  I DON'T DRIVE THE CAR MUCH BECAUSE I'M REALLY SCARED THAT SOMETHING MAY HAPPEN.  WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR IT HAD JUST 69530 MILES AND SINCE THEN I HAVE JUST DROVE LIKE 1500 MILES AT THE MOST.  *JB",
