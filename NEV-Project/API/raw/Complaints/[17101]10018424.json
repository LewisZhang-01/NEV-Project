WHILE PULLING INTO TRAFFIC FROM A STOP, I RAN INTO A POTHOLE (THE SIZE OF A MODERATE SPEED BUMP), WHICH IN TURN DEPLOYED THE PASSENGER CURTAIN AND SIDE AIRBAGS IN THE JETTA.  I WAS NOT GOING MORE THAN 5 - 10 MPH, AND THERE IS NO DAMAGE TO THE CAR OR THE TIRES ASIDE FROM THAT PRODUCED BY THE AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT.  (THE DEALERSHIP TRIED TO SAY THAT A BUBBLE, WHICH HAD DEVELOPED ON THE SIDEWALL OF ONE OF THE TIRES, SOME TIME AGO, WAS A RESULT OF THE IMPACT.  I INFORMED THEM THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE REASONS I HAD SCHEDULED A SERVICE APPT. FOR THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, A WEEK PRIOR TO THE ENTIRE AIRBAG INCIDENT) I CONTACTED THE NEAREST DEALER, WHO IN TURN STATED THEY WOULD CONTACT THE REGIONAL MANAGER.  THEIR RESPONSE TO THIS WAS THAT \"SINCE THE SENSOR INDICATED AN IMPACT, THERE WOULD BE NO ASSISTANCE FROM VW IN THE REPAIR OF THE DAMAGE CAUSED\", AND THAT I SHOULD CONTACT MY INSURANCE COMPANY. I THEN CONTACTED THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE HOTLINE, AND WAS GIVEN THE SAME ANSWER.      *NLM",
