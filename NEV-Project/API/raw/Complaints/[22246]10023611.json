THE BELT IS FED FROM THE ROOF OF THE CAR THOUGH A LOOP ATTACHED ON THE HEAD RESTRAINT, WHEN MINIMAL PRESSURE IS PUT ON THE BELT IT TWIST'S THE HEAD RESTRAINT TO A BREAKING/ BENDING POSITION AND ALLOWS WAY TOO MUCH SLACK IN THE BELT.  MY CONCERN IS THAT IN EVEN A MODERATE FRONTAL COLLISION WITH NO AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT THE HEAD RESTRAINT WOULD BREAK AND CAUSE THE PERSON OCCUPYING THAT SEAT TO STRIKE THE INTERIOR.  OR IN A FRONTAL COLLISION WITH AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT THE PERSON NOT BEING PROPERLY RESTRAINED WITH POSSIBLE AIRBAG INJURY.  *JB",
