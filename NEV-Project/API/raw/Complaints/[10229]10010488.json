REGARDLESS, HAVING THE DRIVER'S SEAT SO POORLY ATTACHED IS SURELY A SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS SERIOUS ATTENTION. I HAVE READ OTHER COMPLAINTS AND I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THE APPARENT LACK OF ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. HOW MANY PEOPLE MUST COMPLAIN OF THE SAME FAILURE OF A SAFETY DEVICE BEFORE THE MANUFACTURER IS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DEFECT. WE CANNOT ALL BE MAKING THIS UP. IT'S NOT LIKE THE ELECTRIC WINDOW OR RADIO QUIT WORKING. DOES SOMEONE HAVE TO GET KILLED?!   *JB",
