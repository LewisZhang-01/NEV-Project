I OWN A 2000 JEEP CHEROKEE LIMITED AND HAD TO REPLACE THE ROTORS AND PADS ON IT TWICE BEFORE 25,000 MILES.  THE BRAKES PULSATE AND WHEN SITTING AT A STREET LIGHT WITH THE BRAKE DEPRESSED, IT FEELS AS IF SOMEONE HAS HIT ME IN THE REAR END.  THE VEHICLE MOVES WHILE THE BRAKE IS DEPRESSED.  I HAVE READ ALL OVER THE INTERNET REGARDING THESE SAME ISSUES AND DAIMLER-CHRYSLER DOESN'T WANT TO ADMIT THERE IS DEFECTIVE EQUIPMENT ON THEIR JEEPS. *JB",
