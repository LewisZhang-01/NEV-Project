        "summary": "THIS VEHICLE CONTAINS 4 IGNITION COILS, ONE OF WHICH FAILED.  THIS PART WHICH IS INSTALLED ON MANY 2002 AND 2003 VW'S IS PRONE TO SUDDEN FAILURE AND VW OWNERS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING MULTIPLE AND COMMON FAILURES OF THEIR IGNITION COILS.  VW HAS REDESIGNED THE PART BUT IS ONLY REPLACING FAILED PARTS AT THIS TIME.  WHEN THIS PART FAILS IT CAUSES THE ENGINE TO STALL OR MISFIRE BADLY AND MAKES THE CAR UNDRIVEABLE. THIS IS CERTAINLY A SAFETY ISSUE IF THE PROBLEM OCCURS ON A HIGHWAY, CAUSING THE CAR TO STALL, OR STRANDING A MOTORIST IN A DANGEROUS LOCATION.  I BELIEVE THAT VW SHOULD REPLACE ALL THE DEFECTIVE IGNITION COILS WITH THE REDESIGNED REPLACEMENT PART.  THANKS.
