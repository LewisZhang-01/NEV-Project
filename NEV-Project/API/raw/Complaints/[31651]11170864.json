IT TOOK MORE THAN 10 MINUTES TO RESTART AND IT TOOK 3-4 TIMES OF PUTTING ON THE BRAKE AND PUSHING THE START BUTTON BEFORE THE SYSTEM WOULD RE-INITIATE.     THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME THE CAR HAD DONE THIS AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM AND TO RE-START.     I TOOK IT TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP IN UPLAND, CA AND THEY DID A SYSTEM/CHARGING CIRCUITS-CHARGE-TEST AND NOTHING CAME FROM THE TEST.   THE CAR IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY BUT SINCE THEY DID NOT FIND ANYTHING IT COST ME $ 95.",
