THE MECHANIC SAID THAT CHRYSLER DID NOT HAVE ANY RECALLS ON IT AND THEY DO NOT SELL THE PLUG BY ITSELF.  THE MECHANIC SAID THAT I WOULD HAVE TO BUY A NEW FUEL PUMP.  YOU SEE THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE FUEL PUMP ITSELF HAS A DRAIN PLUG AND THAT DETERIORATED AND FUEL BEGAN TO LEAK.  I THINK THIS NEEDS FURTHER INVESTIGATING.  I WAS LUCKY THAT I CAUGHT IT ON TIME.  THINK OF THOSE FAMILIES WHO WILL NOT BE SO LUCKY. I STILL HAVE THE SAME FUEL PUMP.  WE JUST INSTALLED A PLUG ON IT.",
