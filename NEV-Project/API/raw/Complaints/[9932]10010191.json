AFTER TIRE REPLACED TOOK TO DODGE DEALER FOR FRONT END ALIGNMENT.  DEALER REFUSED BECAUSE THEY SAID FRONT BALL JOINTS NEEDED REPLACED COSTING $900.  WHEN ASKED IF THIS WAS UNUSUAL DEALER SAID NO AND THAT BALL JOINTS COULD WEAR OUT IN 10,000 MILES.  I CALLED DAIMLER CHRYSLER TO COMPLAIN AND THEY REFUSED MY REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE SAYING NO PROBLEMS OF THIS TYPE HAVE BEEN REPORTED.  THE TRUCK WAS NEVER DRIVEN OFF ROAD, NEVER INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT, ONLY DRIVEN TO WORK AND HOME WITHIN 40 MILES OF MY HOME.  TRUCK WAS NEVER ABUSED AND I FEEL THE BALL JOINTS (AND TIRES) SHOULD NOT HAVE WORN OUT IN THIS SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME.  I AM AN ENGINEER AND BELIEVE THERE IS A DESIGN OR MANUFACTURING PROBLEM THAT LED TO THIS PREMATURE FAILURE.  I HAVE CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE TRUCK WITHOUT REPLACING THE BALL JOINTS YET SINCE NO ONE HAS TOLD ME THERE IS ANY SAFETY REASON NOT TO.  THE TRUCK DRIVES FINE, STRAIGHT, AND EASY.     *NLM",
