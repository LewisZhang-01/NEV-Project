        "summary": "ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2013, WHILE SITTING IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, I TRIED TO UNLOCK THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT DOOR LOCK BY PRESSING THE UNLOCK BUTTON TO ALLOW MY PASSENGER TO GET INTO THE CAR. ALL CAR DOOR LOCKS OPENED EXCEPT THE RIGHT FRONT PASSENGER.  SO I PRESSED THE BUTTON AGAIN AND ALL THE DOORS LOCKED.  WAITED AND HIT THE UNLOCK BUTTON AND ALL THE DOORS UNLOCKED EXCEPT FOR THE RIGHT FRONT PASSENGER DOOR.  I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE IN THE CAR AND WENT AROUND TO THE RIGHT FRONT PASSENGER DOOR AND INSERTED THE KEY DIRECTLY IN THE DOOR LOCK.  IT STILL WOULD NOT OPEN UNTIL I INSERTED THE KEY AND PULLED THE DOOR HANDLE AT THE SAME TIME.  SO VERY RELUCTANTLY MY PASSENGER GOT INTO THE FRONT SEAT.  HE TRIED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR ONCE INSIDE BY USING THE HANDLE AND WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.  THIS IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE.  THE NEXT DAY I CALLED THE DEALER WHERE I HAD PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT TO ANALYZE THE PROBLEM.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE INTO THE DEALERSHIP ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2013 AND WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH WHAT I LEARNED.  THE DOOR LOCK ACTUATOR WAS BAD AND A SPECIAL PART WOULD HAVE TO BE ORDERED.  THE TOTAL COST OF REPAIR FOR THIS DEFECTIVE PART WOULD COST ME $346.13 + TAX.  THE SERVICE MANAGER DID OFFER ME A 10% DISCOUNT. AT THAT TIME I DECLINED THE REPAIR BECAUSE OF THE COST.   I AM VERY NERVOUS NOW ABOUT EVEN DRIVING THE CAR BECAUSE I WORRY THAT THE DRIVER'S SIDE LOCK ACTUATOR MAY ONE DAY TRAP ME IN THE VEHICLE AS WELL.  MY CAR IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY.   BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS SAFETY DEFECT, I DON'T FEEL THAT IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO BEAR THE FULL COST OF REPAIR. SO I'M BRINGING THIS TO YOUR ATTENTION.    *TR",
