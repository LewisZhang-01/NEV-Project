PVC CANNOT AND HAS NOT TOLERATED THE HEAT AND VIBRATION DEVELOPED WITHIN THIS VEHICLE'S ENGINE COMPARTMENT. IT, THE PVC INSULATION, HAS BECOME SO BRITTLE IT IS LITERALLY CHIPPING  APART AT EVERY VITAL SENSOR AND/OR DEVICE- INCLUDING FUEL DELIVERY COMPONENTS! THIS HAS ME EXTREMELY CONCERNED SINCE I'M STARTING TO GET CHECK ENGINE SIGNALS TO THE DASH DISPLAY NOW. I CALLED MERCEDES' 800 NUMBER AND THEY ARE ACTING IGNORANT ABOUT THIS ISSUE SINCE I'M NOT THE ORIGINAL OWNER.  *JB",
