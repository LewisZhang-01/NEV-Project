THE SEATS CAN MOVE BACK AND FORTH A FEW INCHES, WITHOUT DEPRESSING ON THE LEVEL TO MOVE THE SEATS BACK AND FORTH.  THE AUTOMOBILE DEALERSHIP DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM TO BE THE TRACK AND IT REQUIRED REPLACEMENT.  THE AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURER AND DEALER CONTENDS THIS IS A REPAIR ITEM AND DOES NOT BELIEVE IT TO BE DEFECT IN THE SEATS OR A SAFETY PROBLEM SHOULD AN ACCIDENT OCCUR.  THE FACT THAT BOTH SEATS NOW DO THIS AND IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAPPEN UNDER NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR WOULD INDICATE OTHERWISE.  THE AUTOMOBILE HAS ONLY 42,000 MILES AND IS LESS THAN 4 YEARS OLD.    SECOND FAILURE: THE OUTER TRIM OF THE DASHBOARD HOUSING OF THE  PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG HAS COME LOOSE.  WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS DEFECT MAY DISRUPT OR ALTER THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE AIRBAG SHOULD A COLLISION OCCUR.  DEALERSHIP AND AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURE CONTENDS  THIS SITUATION WOULD NOT CAUSE THE AIRBAG TO MALFUNCTION AND THEREFORE NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  THEY WOULD NOT SUPPLY INFORMATION OR DATA TO SUPPORT THEIR ASSESSMENT.   *JB",
