AFTER READING ARTICLES INDICATING THAT AUDI WILL REPLACE ALL COILS, WHETHER THEY ARE BROKEN OR NOT, I ASKED THE DEALERSHIP TO REPLACE ALL COILS. THEY INSISTED THAT THEY WILL ONLY REPLACE THOSE THAT ARE DEFECTIVE, NOT ALL AS REPORTED IN SEVERAL ARTICLES (E.G., MOTORTREND).     I TOLD THE DEALERSHIP THAT I WILL BE DRIVING FROM MA TO CA THIS WEEKEND. I TOLD THEM THAT I DO NOT WANT TO BE HALF WAY ACCROSS THE COUNTRY AND HAVE ANOTHER COIL BREAK. I WANT ALL COILS REPLACED, BUT THE DEALERSHIP REFUSES.",
