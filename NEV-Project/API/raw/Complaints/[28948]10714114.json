        "summary": "ON THE NIGHT DEC 24,2014, I HAD PICKED UP MY RENTAL CAR(1013 MAZDA 2 SILVER SEDAN) FROM DOLLAR RENTAL CAR AT BWI AIRPORT. ABOUT 30 MINUTES AFTER I DROVE OFF THE LOT, ABOUT 5 MILES AWAY FROM THE PICKUP GARAGE, I NOTICED THE LOW TIRE PRESSURE  WARNING LIGHT WAS ON. BEFORE I HAD A CHANCE TO TURN AROUND AND RETURN THE CAR, THE FRONT DRIVERS SIDE TIRE BLEW OUT. THE TREAD WAS SEPARATED. THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY NEGLIGENCE ON PART OF THE RENTAL CAR COMPANY. WHOEVER DID THE MAINTENANCE AND SAFETY CHECK NEVER SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED THE VEHICLE TO BE DRIVEN OFF THE LOT. NO WHERE IN THE RENTAL CONTRACT DOES IT STATE THAT THE RENTER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPERATIONAL & MECHANICAL MAINTENANCE OF THE VEHICLE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF REFUELING THE VEHICLE. THE CONTRACT ALSO DOESN'T STATE THAT THE RENTER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY NEGLIGENT OR IMPROPER MAINTENANCE PERFORMED BY THE OWNER/RENTAL CAR COMPANY. I WAS FORTUNATE I DIDN'T HAVE AN ACCIDENT. BECAUSE DOLLAR/THRIFTY RENTAL CAR REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE/RECTIFY  THIS PROBLEM OR TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS NEGLIGENCE, THIS PROBLEM WILL EVENTUALLY HAPPEN TO ANOTHER CUSTOMER.   *TR",
