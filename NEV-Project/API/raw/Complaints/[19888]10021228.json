THE PANEL GOT CAUGHT IN A REAR TIRE, CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO TEMPORARILY LOSE CONTROL, THEN THIS PIECE OF PANEL THAT IS ABOUT 3' SQUARE BLASTED INTO THE WINDSHIELD OF THE CAR BEHIND.  THIS PANEL IS REMOVED FOR OIL CHANGES, ENGINE REPAIR AND FLUID FILLS.  THE MECHANIC SAID THIS HAPPENS WITH ALL THE BEETLES, BUT THE PANEL HAD TO BE REPLACED.  I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE ASPECT OF ROAD DEBRIS AND THE LOSS OF CONTROL WHILE DRIVING 70 MPH.  *JB",
