        "summary": "ON JUNE 1ST, 2003 I HAD THE REAR GLASS HATCH OF MY 2002 FORD EXPLORER OPEN BRIEFLY TO REMOVE GROCERIES.  MY DAUGHTER WAS IN REAR 3RD SEAT.  I STEPPED BACK FROM VEHICLE TO ASSIST DAUGHTER IN GETTING OUT AND GLASS IN REAR HATCH EXPLODED (WITHOUT BEING TOUCHED OR MOVED).  I WAS HIT BY GLASS SHARDS AND IF I HAD NOT JUST STEPPED BACK, THE 4 X 6 METAL ATTACHMENT WOULD HAVE HIT ME IN THE HEAD AS IT IS ATTACHED TO THE VEHICLE ONLY BY THE GLASS AND DEFROST CABLES.  MY DAUGHTER WAS SHAKEN BUT FORTUNATELY NOT HIT BY THE EXPLODING GLASS.  A NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE STREET HEARD THE EXPLOSION AND THOUGHT IT WAS A GUN SHOT.  GLASS SHARDS/PIECES WERE STREWN THROUGHOUT OUR 3 CAR GARAGE, SOME LANDING ON THE TOP OF OUR OTHER VEHICLE PARKED NEXT THE  EXPLORER.  THE LOCAL DEALER TOLD US IT WAS A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT BUT AS THERE WAS NOT A RECALL ON THIS PARTICULAR AREA, THEY WOULD NOT BE 100% RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COST OF REPLACEMENT AS WE WERE 2,000 MILES OUT OF OUR WARRANTY.  FORD COMPANY IN DEERBORNE, MI THREATENED TO REVOKE ANY ASSISTANCE AS WE \"DID NOT SEEM APPRECIATIVE\" OF THE 80% THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP OFFERED.  WE STRONGLY FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE  (NOT A WARRANTY ISSUE) THAT FORD SHOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR.  THIS TYPE OF GLASS  EXPLOSION COULD SERIOUSLY INJURE OR KILL SOMEONE.  *NLM  PE04045.PCO",
