THE MECHANIC PULLED THE FUSE WHICH SHUT THE MOTOR DOWN. HE INDICATED THEY HAVE HAD SEVERAL VEHICLES WITH THE SAME PROBLEM BUT CHEVROLET WOULDN'T AUTHORIZE THE REPAIR WHEN OUT OF WARRANTY. HE SAID THE PART ITSELF WOULD COST $800. SEEMS TO ME ANY PROBLEM WITH A BRAKE COMPONENT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A HAZARD AND A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED ON THESE VEHICLES.   *NLM",
