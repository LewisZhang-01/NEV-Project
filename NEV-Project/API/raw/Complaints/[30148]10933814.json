BILL BROWN FORD IN LIVONIA MI DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A FAILING CATALYTIC CONVERTER. THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE FOCUS, BUT FORD HASN'T DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I'VE RESEARCHED THE ISSUE ON LINE AND THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER. I ALSO HAVE A FRIEND WHO IS A MECHANIC AT A FORD DEALERSHIP AND HE SAID FORD IS QUITE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM. TWO YEARS AGO I WAS ALMOST REAR ENDED WHEN THE CAR SUDDENLY WENT OUT OF GEAR AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND FLASHED A WARNING. FORD REPLACED THE TCU. THE CAR IS NOW HESITATING AGAIN ALONG WITH SHUTTERING WHEN ACCELERATING.",
