CAR ACCELERATED, JUMPED A CURB, OVER A 6 FOOT WIDE GRASS SEPARATION AND TOTALED A PARKED CAR IN FRONT OF THE PARKING SPACE. CAR WAS SERVICED THAT VERY DAY FOR IT'S 5,000 MILE CHECK.  FIRST TIME WE DROVE THE CAR AFTER BEING SERVICED.  HAD OUR CAR REPAIRED FOR FRONT END DAMAGE. CONTACTED LEXUS ON THEIR HOT LINE, REPORTED THE INCIDENT, WAS INSTRUCTED TO WRITE THEM WITH ALL THE DETAILS.  HAVE NOT HEARD ONE THING FROM LEXUS CORPORATE SINCE WE SENT THE LETTER ON 12/30/09    NO ONE HAS CHECKED THE CAR.  CONTACTED THE DEALER IN PEORIA ILLINOIS.  THEY WOULD NOT RETURN OUR CALLS.  CONFRONTED THEM ABOUT THE PROBLEM ON SATURDAY.  THEY WOULD TAKE THE CAR BACK IN A TRADE.  WOULD REQUIRE ME TO TAKE ANOTHER LEASE, ADDED A YEAR ONTO THE LEASE PLUS INCREASED MY MONTHLY PAYMENT BY $80.  THIS WAS NEVER AN OFFER TO CHECK THE VEHICLE.  CAR IS BASICALLY PARKED IN THE GARAGE BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID TO DRIVE IT. IT WAS NOT THE FLOOR MATS.  THERE IS NO WAY THAT WAS A PROBLEM. *TR  UPDATED 05/24/10",
