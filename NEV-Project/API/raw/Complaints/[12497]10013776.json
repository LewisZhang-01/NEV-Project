        "summary": "I NOTICED AN ODD NOISE WHICH SOUNDED LIKE SOMETHING ROLLING AROUND IN THE BACK OF THE CAR, BUT NOTHING WAS.  AT TIME OF STATE INSPECTION, I ALERTED THE INSPECTORS.  THEY FELT SOMETHING BUMPING FROM WITHIN THE GAS TANK.  I DISASSEMBLED THE FLOOR COVERINGS AND INSPECTION PORTS FOR FUEL PUMP AND GAUGE SENDER.  I REMOVED THE GAUGE SENDER AND LOOKED INTO THE TANK AND OBSERVED A PLASTIC BOWL-LIKE OBJECT SURROUNDING THE FUEL PUMP.  I ROCKED THE CAR AND THIS BOWL WOULD SLOSH AGAINST THE PUMP.  THIS OBJECT APPEARS TO BE A BAFFLE TO REDUCE SLOSHING AROUND THE PUMP.  IT WOULD SEEM THAT IT WAS INTENDED TO BE GLUED IN PLACE, BUT HAS BROKEN LOOSE.  I SUPPOSE THAT THIS WOULD EVENTUALLY DAMAGE PUMP OR TANK.  A NEW TANK WILL COST CLOSE TO $400 WHICH I WILL NOW ORDER.  ADDITIONAL PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT FAILURE OF ANTI-LOCK BRAKE/TRACS SYSTEM MODULE.*JB",
