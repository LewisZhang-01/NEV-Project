        "summary": "WITH ONLY 21,000 MILES MY 2005 PT CRUISER CONVERTIBLE BASE MODEL EXPERIENCED A FAILURE OF THE MANUAL CLUTCH ASSEMBLY. I HAD DRIVEN ABOUT 100 MILES OF OPEN HIGHWAY AND WAS ENTERING A MORE URBAN SETTING WITH FREQUENT STOPS AND STARTS DUE TO TRAFFIC LIGHTS. AFTER ABOUT THE 5TH OR 6TH LIGHT MY GEAR SHIFT LEVER WOULD MOVE BUT THE CAR WOULD NOT GO INTO ANY GEAR. LUCKILY I HAD ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND WAS ABLE TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP IN SAVANNAH GA. IT TOOK 3 DAYS TO COMPLETE THE REPAIRS BECAUSE THE ENTIRE CLUTCH ASSEMBLY AND HOUSING HAD TO BE REPLACED. ALTHOUGH A MANUAL CLUTCH IS CLASSED AS A \"CONSUMABLE\" PART CHRYSLER AGREED TO SHARING HALF THE REPLACEMENT COST FOR THE PARTS DUE TO A MECHANICAL FAILURE. I DROVE MY FIRST PT CRUISER ( AN EARLY PRODUCTION 2001 MODEL ) OVER 86,000 MILES AND NEVER HAD A CLUTCH PROBLEM. I AM NOW 18,000 MILES INTO THE LIFE OF THE REPLACEMENT CLUTCH WITH NO SIGNS OF ANY PROBLEMS. *JB",
