I ONLY HAD THE CAR A SHORT TIME BEFORE FOR SOME REASON ON THE WAY HOME FROM WORK ONE DAY THE CAR MADE SOME FUNNY NOISES AND OF COURSE IT BENT A ROD.  I CALLED A COUPLE OF FRIENDS AND ONE OWNS HIS OWN PERFORMANCE SHOP AND SAID IT HAPPENS VERY OFTEN WITH MY 4.6L DOHC ENGINE.  I NOTICED THAT SOMETIMES THE CAR WOULD ONLY REV UPTO ABOUT 4,000 RPM SOMETIMES BUT YET THE RPM RED LINE IS 7,000RPM BUT SINCE I DON'T USE IT TO RACE I DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT.  WELL I AM NOT TOO HAPPY ABOUT THIS AND FORD SAID THAT IT WOULD COST ME $3,500 TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.  IF IT IS HAPPENING SO MUCH WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY UP TO FIX SOMETHING THAT THEY PUT WEAK PARTS IN.",
