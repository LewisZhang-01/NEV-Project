CALLED THE HONDA DEALERSHIP, GARDENA HONDA, WHERE I BOUGHT THE CAR AND GET IT SERVICED. THEY SAID THEY WOULD ORDER THE PART AND CALL ME WHEN IT ARRIVED. ON AUGUST 20TH AND AUGUST 27,  I CALLED TO SEE IF PART WAS IN, AND DEALERSHIP CLAIMED IT WAS STILL ON ORDER AND THAT THEY WOULD CALL ME WHEN IT CAME IN. I NEVER RECEIVED A CALL BACK.  ON NOV 2, I CALLED AGAIN TO THE GARDENA HONDA DEALERSHIP. I SPOKE WITH KIM, WHO CLAIMED THERE WAS NO RECORD OF MY CAR BEING SERVICED THERE ( I HAVE BROUGHT IT 3-4 TIMES A YEAR SINCE PURCHASED IN 2010!) OR THE RECALLED PART BEING ORDERED. I ASKED TO SPEAK WITH THE MANAGER. SHE TOOK MY NAME AND PHONE NUMBER, BUT NEVER RECEIVED A CALL BACK.     I AM CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY AND THAT OF MY PASSENGERS DUE TO THE DEFECTIVE AIR BAGS I WILL TAKE LEGAL ACTION FOR ANY INJURIES RESULTING FROM THE DEFECT, WHICH I HAVE TRIED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS TO REPAIR.",
