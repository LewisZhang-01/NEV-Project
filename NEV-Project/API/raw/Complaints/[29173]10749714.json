        "summary": "I WAS WAITING IN NEUTRAL AT A RED LIGHT WHEN I NOTICED THAT THE CLUTCH PEDAL HAD SUNK ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND WOULD NOT RETURN TO THE ENGAGED POSITION. BECAUSE OF THIS, I COULDN'T GET THE CAR INTO GEAR AND ENDED UP HAVING TO PUSH THE CAR OUT OF THE INTERSECTION ONTO THE SIDEWALK WHERE I THEN RECEIVED A TICKET FOR ILLEGALLY PARKING EVEN THOUGH THE VEHICLE WAS COMPLETELY UNDRIVEABLE. LATER THAT WEEK, I REMOVED THE TRANSMISSION TO DISCOVER THAT THE CONCENTRIC SLAVE CYLINDER (CSC) HAD DISINTEGRATED AND ALL THAT WAS LEFT WAS A FEW BITS OF RUBBER AND PLASTIC COVERED IN CLUTCH FLUID. I'VE SINCE REPLACED THE PART WITH A METAL REPLACEMENT THAT HAS PERFORMED FLAWLESSLY SINCE.     INCIDENCES OF CSC FAILURE ARE NOTED EXTENSIVELY ON ENTHUSIAST FORUMS, AND NISSAN HAS IN MOST CASES REFUSED TO REPAIR THE DEFECT UNDER WARRANTY. THIS COULD BE A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN IF THIS FAILED WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS MOVING.
