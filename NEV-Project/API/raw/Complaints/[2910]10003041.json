MY A/C MADE A HIGH PITCH SQUEAL AND AFTER AT LEAST FIVE TIMES OF TRYING TO REPAIR THE EXISTING A/C CLUTCH, A NEW ONE WAS FINALLY PUT ON.  MY FRONT END SUSPENSION HAS BEEN FIXED.  MY MIDLIFT GATE CRACKED IN NOVEMBER AND A NEW ONE WAS PUT ON.  I HAVE HAD DAILY PROBLEMS WITH THE DRIVER'S SIDE SEAT NOT FULLY GOING INTO POSITION WHEN I START MY TRUCK AND THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN FIXED AS THE SERVICE DEPT. THAT I DEAL WITH NEVERS SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE PROBLEM.  FUNNY HOW IT DOES IT EVERY DAY FOR ME, THOUGH.  MY BLINKERS WILL SOMETIMES STICK AND STAY ON WITHOUT BLINKING--THIS ALSO HAS NOT BEEN FIXED.  AT THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY,2003, ON THE WAY HOME FROM A TRIP, MY HUSBAND AND I NOTICED THAT EVERY TIME WE SLOWED THE TRUCK DOWN, THERE WAS A BLAST OF AIR FROM THE UPPER VENTS IN THE VEHICLE.  THIS HAPPENED NO MATTER WHAT SETTING WE HAD IT IN (IE. DEFROST OR FLOOR VENTS).  THIS PAST THURSDAY, JAN.16, THE SUSPENSION WAS REPAIRED AND SUPPOSEDLY THE HEATING SYSTEM WAS AS WELL.  NOW THE AIR DOESN'T SEEM TO LEAK OUT THE TOP VENTS, BUT CONTINUOSLY COMES OUT OF THE FLOOR VENT, NO MATTER WHAT SETTING THE HEAT IS ON.  I HAVE A RENTAL VEHICLE ONCE AGAIN, WHILE THEY KEEP THE VEHICLE OVERNIGHT TONIGHT TO SEE IF THEY CAN HOPEFULLY FIX THIS PROBLEM.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, WE ARE CURRENTLY CHECKING INTO THE LEMON LAW FOR OUR STATE!!!",
