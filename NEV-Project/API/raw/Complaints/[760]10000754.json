SERVICE DEPARTMENT STATED THAT THIS WAS DUE TO A BAD BATCH OF MANIFOLD GASKETS AND THAT GMC WAS NOW GETTING GASKETS FROM ANOTHER SUPPLIER.  THIS APPEARS TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM WITHIN GM PRODUCTS; HOWEVER, NO RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED; NOR WAS THERE ANY OFFER OF A DISCOUNT OR REFUND FROM THE DEALER FOR THIS APPARENT DEFECT.  THIS COULD BE CONSIDERED A SAFETY PROBLEM AS THE ENGINE COULD GET WATER IN IT AND FREEZE UP.  IF THIS HAPPENS DURING THE WINTER, ON A BACKROAD IN MINNESOTA WHEN THE TEMPERATURE MAY BE WELL BELOW ZERO, SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES COULD FOLLOW.  I SEE A PENDING LAW SUIT COMING.",
