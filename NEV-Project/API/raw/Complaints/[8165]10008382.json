ALTHOUGH I DID NOT COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE COOLANT I FEEL THERE IS A STRONG POSSIBILITY FOR THIS TO HAPPEN WHILE WORKING ON THE ENGINE DUE TO POOR DESIGN/CONSTRUCTION OF THE REFERENCED CONNECTOR. IF YOU CAN SEND ME AN E-MAIL ADDRESS THAN I CAN ATTACH A JPEG PICTURE I WILL BE HAPPY TO SEND A PICTURE AND A DRAWING THAT DEPICTS THE FAILURE.  *NLM",
