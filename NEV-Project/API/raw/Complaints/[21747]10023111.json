STOPPED AND FOUND ANTI FREEZE SPRAYING OUT OF EXHAUST MANIFOLD.  HAD IT TOWED TO A MECHANIC THAT ADVISED ME THAT  FORD HAD UPDATED PLASTIC MANIFOLD PART WITH AN ALUMINUM PART BUT DID NOT DO A RECALL. $1,000 DOLLARS LATER I WAS BACK ON THE ROAD.  WE ARE FORD PEOPLE AND VERY DISAPPOINTED IN FORD FOR NOT RECALLING THIS ITEM. I HAD MY WHOLE FAMILY WITH ME AND 3 HOURS FROM HOME, HAD TO PAY FOR ANOTHER NIGHT OF LODGING AND FOOD ON TOP OF THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE BEING STRESSFUL I AM OUT $1,000 DOLLARS. WE ARE GOING TO  WRITE TO FORD AND BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU.  AFTER THAT WE WILL GO TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT.    *NLM",
