        "summary": "APPARENTLY JEEP WRANGLERS ARE KNOWN FOR THIS PROBLEM, YET THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A RECALL.  FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW MY DASH CLUSTER HAS BEEN MALFUNCTIONING.  THE RPM GUAGE AND SPEEDOMETER BOTH DROP TO ZERO, THE AIRBAG AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS COME ON, AND THE DIGITAL ODOMETER LOSES ITS READOUT AND INSTEAD SAYS \"NO BUS\".  IT HAPPENS SPORADICALLY, NOT CONTINUOUSLY.  I TOOK IT TO AN INDEPENDENT AUTO SHOP WHICH WAS ABLE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM, BUT IT BEGAN AGAIN AFTER A COUPLE MONTHS.  I JUST TOOK IT TO MY LOCAL JEEP DEALER FOR THIS PROBLEM, AS WELL AS OTHER ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS.  (MY JEEP WOULDN'T START FOR THE LAST 3 DAYS.)  THEY FOUND A WIRE THAT WAS CORRODED AND REPLACED OR REPAIRED IT.  MY JEEP RUNS AGAIN, BUT ON THE WAY HOME FROM THE DEALERSHIP THE DASH CLUSTER WENT HAYWIRE AGAIN.  EVERYONE I HAVE SPOKEN TO IN THE AUTO SHOPS IS AWARE THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH JEEPS, INCLUDING MY JEEP DEALER, BUT NOBODY HAS TAKEN STEPS TO REMEDY THIS PROBLEM.  TO DATE, I HAVE SPENT NEARLY $1,300.00 TO FIX THE DASH CLUSTER AND OTHER ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS (PROBABLY ALL RELATED) AND MY CAR ONLY HAS 43,000 MILES ON IT.  CONVENIENTLY, MY MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY EXPIRED AT 36,000 MILES.  THIS BEGAN AT AROUND 38,000 MILES.   *NLM",
