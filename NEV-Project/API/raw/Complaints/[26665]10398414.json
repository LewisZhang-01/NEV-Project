(14 GALLONS OF GAS HAD BEEN PUMPED)  THE GAGE JUMPED UP AND DOWN FOR TWO DAYS AND THEN SHOWED ALMOST FULL.  THIS HAS HAPPENED WITH EVERY FILL UP EVERY WEEK SINCE THEN.  I NEVER  HAVE A CORRECT READING ON THE GAGE.  THERE WAS NO WARNING OR ODDITIES LEADING UP TO GAGE NOT WORKING CORRECTLY.  I FILL MY TANK EVERY WEEK REGARDLESS OF HOW MUCH GAS I HAVE IN THE VEHICLE.  I SEE NOW I HAVE BEEN DOING THE BEST THING FOR MY SAFETY SINCE THE ENVOY IS BEING INVESTIGATED FOR THE SAME ISSUE.  *TR",
