WE CAN FEEL THE ENGINE IS HAVING TROUBLE GOING FORWRD EVRY TIME I PUNCH IN THE GAS PEDAL. MY PASSANGER AND I CAN FEEL THE ACCELERATION BIT CHOCKING. SO, I BROUGHT IT SOME MECHANICS & THEY SAYS POSSIBLE TIME CHAIN PROBLEM. THEY DIAGNOSE THE CAR AND HERE SOME OF THE CODE CAME OUT. P0011, P0014, P0016, P0018, P0021. AT FIRST, THEY THOUGHT OF CHANGING THE CAMSHAFT SENSORS AND CRANKSHAFT SENSORS MAYBE IT WOULD RESOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT IT DIDN'T. THEY SUGGEST TO CALL THE CADILLAC DEALER POSSIBLE FOR RECALLS. I DRIVE MY CAR DAILY TO WORK, FROM MERCED TO LATHROP, THAT'S ABOUT 120 MILES BACK AND FORT.
