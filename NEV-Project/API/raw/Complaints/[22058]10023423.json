ALL OF A SUDDEN THE ENGINE RACES ON ITS OWN AND THE CAR LUNGES FORWARD. SEVERAL VISITS TO THE DEALER AND ROAD TESTS HAVE COME UP WITH NOTHING. THE DEALER HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PINPOINT THE PROBLEM. I STILL HAVE THE CAR WHICH I DRIVE VERY CAUTIOUSLY. IT REMINDS ME OF MY DIRT RACE BIKE THAT HAS AN EXPLODING POWER-BAND.  DON'T TAILGATE WITH THIS PROBLEM OR YOU WILL KISS SOMEONE'S BUMPER.   *NLM",
