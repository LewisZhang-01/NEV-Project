I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IT IS PROBABLY ON IT'S WAY OUT SEEING AS CHRYSLER KNOWS NOT HOW TO MAKE A WORKING PRODUCT.  IT IS VERY DANGEROUS FOR ME TO TRY TO PULL OUT ONTO A ROAD WHEN I AM NOT SURE WHETHER OR NOT I AM GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO.  WHEN I DO AND IT DOESN'T MOVE, I THEN HAVE TO HURRY UP AND GUN IT SO AS NOT TO GET HIT FROM ONCOMING TRAFFIC. THE CAR THEN JERKS INTO GEAR AFTER REVING UP TO AROUND 50 IF I TAKE IT THAT FAR. I USUALLY DON'T BECAUSE THEN ENGINE SOUNDS LIKE IT IS SCREAMING.  SHIFTING IS A PROBLEM.  IT IS WELL KNOWN TO MOST CHRYSLER OWNERS THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THEIR TRANSMISSIONS, YET CHRYSLER DOES NOTHING TO UPGRADE OR FIX THE DEFECTS.  HAD I KNOWN THIS INFORMATION BEFORE I HAD BOUGHT THE CAR, I WOULD'VE BOUGHT A DIFFERENT MAKE VEHICLE.",
