LUCKILY FOR ME, IT DIDN'T RESULT IN ANY DEATH, INJURY OR DESTRUCTION OF THE PROPERTY BUT STILL THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THE ULTRA PERFORMANCE TIRE TO FAIL IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME (UNDER 6000 MILES.) AFTER FURTHER INSPECTION I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT ONE MORE TIRE DEVELOPED SIDEWALL CRACK AND WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED.   *JB",
