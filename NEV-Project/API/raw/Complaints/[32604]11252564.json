MECHANICAL SAID THERE WAS AN OIL LEAK ABOVE THE ALTERNATOR. FRIED THE ALTERNATOR.   YESTERDAY, WIFE WAS DRIVING, BROKE DOWN ON HIGHWAY. I LOOKED AT THE ENGINE BLOCK AND THERE IS OIL LEAKING FROM THE VALVE PAN GASKET DOWN INTO THE ALTERNATOR AGAIN. HYUNDAI  SAYS MY MODEL OF 2008 VERACRUZ WASNT AFFECTED BY THE STANDING RECALL THAT IS ACTIVE RIGHT NOW. BUT I THINK MY CAR HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS PROBLEM WITH  FAULTY VALVE PAN GASKETS. VEHICLE LOST POWER WHILE IN MOTION,  ALL DUMMY LIGHTS CAME ON. ENGINE SHUT OFF AND WOULD NOT ALLOW IS TO GET IT IN PARK. MECHANICS CHECKED THE BATTERY. BATTERY TESTED PERFECT. SAID IT HAD LOW VOLTAGE AND WASNT BEING CHARGED BY THE SYSTEM",
