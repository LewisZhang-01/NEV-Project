I RENTED A U-HAUL IN EDWARDSVILLE, IL (CONTRACT #12899) ON SATURDAY, MARCH 13.  THE VEHICLE DID NOT START AFTER IT WAS LOADED, AND DURING THE DRIVE TO OUR DESTINATION, THE VEHICLE STALLED 25-30 TIMES (25 MILE DRIVE).  THE CUSTOMER SERVICE ROAD ASSISTANCE WAS NO USE; AND FURTHERMORE, THE FIRST VEHICLE THEY HAD FOR US, ALSO WOULD NOT START.  BASICALLY, WHEN WE DROVE THE VEHICLE, EVERY MILE, A \"SERVICE ENGINE SOON\" LIGHT WOULD COME ON, AND THE VEHICLE WOULD SHUT DOWN AND COAST.  THERE NEEDS TO BE A MORE THOROUGH INSPECTION OF EACH U-HAUL VEHICLE AND THE PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE ON EACH VEHICLE TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE SAFE FOR HIGHWAY AND ROAD CONSUMPTION.  *NM",
