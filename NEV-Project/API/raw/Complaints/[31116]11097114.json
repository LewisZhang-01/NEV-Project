        "summary": "TAKATA RECALL: I WAS DRIVING ON I-5 NORTH FREEWAY AT THE SPEED OF 65 MILES/HR. SUDDENLY,  ABOUT 1 MILE FROM ALTON EXIT,  THE \"CHECKING POWER STEERING SYSTEM\" LIGHT WAS ON, AND I COULD BARELY TURN THE WHEEL. IT WAS SUPER DANGEROUS. I EXITED  FREEWAY TRYING TO PARK IN THE NEAREST PARKING LOT. BUT I COULD NOT PARK PROPERLY INTO THE PARKING SPACE BECAUSE THE WHEEL WAS TOO HEAVY TO TURN. THIS WAS ON THE WAY TO MY JOB INTERVIEW. THIS INCIDENT CAUSED BIG TROUBLE ON MY JOB INTERVIEW. I HAD TO RESCHEDULE IT WITH THE COMPANY.  MY CAR ONLY HAS 55,000 MILAGE AND I ALWAYS KEEP VERY GOOD MAINTENANCE ON THE CAR.  SUCH BIG ISSUE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN ON THE VIECLE WITH SUCH LOW MILAGE. ACURA DEALER CHARGED ME $1800 TO REPLACE THE COMPUTER PART THAT CONTROLS THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM.  IT IS LOT OF MONEY, NOT MENTION THE TERRIBLE SAFETY HAZARD IT CAUSED. EVEN NEW PART HAS BEEN INSTALLED, I AM STILL WORRY SIMILAR ISSUE WILL HAPPEN IN FUTURE. I SAW LOTS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE ON THE SAME MODEL. ACURA SHOULD DEFINITELY RECALL THIS.",
