        "summary": "I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEADLIGHTS GOING OUT ON MY 1998 CADELLAC DEVELLE. THE PASSENGER SIDE LENS BLEW OFF THE CAR AND WENT FLYING.  THE HEADLIGHT WENT OUT. I STOPED TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPEN - SAW NO LENS ON THE ONE SIDE. CHECKED THE OTHER SIDE AND THE LENS WAS READY TO FALL OFF.  I HAD NOT LIGHTS ON ONE SIDE AND IF I HAD NOT WIRED THE OTHER LENS IN PLACE IT WOULD HAVE BLEW OFF AND I WOULD HAVE HAD NO HEADLIGHTS. CONTACED THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THEY ARE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM BUT SUGGESTED I CONTACT THE 800#.  THEY REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE PROBLEM STATING IT WAS OUT OF WARRENTY.  RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM I AM FINDING THEIR HAS BEEN SEVERAL COMPLANTS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. I BELEIVE AN INVESTIGATION IS IN ORDER.  THIS IS VERY UNSAFE FOR THE DRIVE AND A PROJECTILE COULD DO A GREAT DEAL OF HARM TO A PERSON BEING STRUCK BUT THE FLYING LENS.  THE SAD PART IS YOU CAN NOT EVEN BUY A LENS. TH E DEALER WILL ONLY SELL YOU A COMPLETE ASSEMBLY AT $240.  HOW WOULD ONE KNOW IF THE NEW ASM WILL NOT DO THE SAME?",
