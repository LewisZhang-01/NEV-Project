        "summary": "MY 2012 FORD FOCUS WITH DUAL CLUTCH, DPS-6 TRANSMISSION HAS ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS UNCLUTCHED THE TRANSMISSION WHILE ATTEMPTING TO ACCELERATE FROM A STOP TO MAKE A LEFT TURN ACROSS A BUSY ROAD.  THE UNEXPECTED LACK OF ACCELERATION DUE TO THE TRANSMISSION FAILING TO TRANSMIT POWER TO THE WHEELS HAS NEARLY CAUSED MY WIFE AND I TO BE HIT BY ONCOMING TRAFFIC DESPITE STARTING THE TURN WITH ADEQUATE ROOM TO CROSS TRAFFIC AND ACCELERATE.  THANKFULLY, ADEQUATE SPACE AND REACTION BY ONCOMING DRIVERS HAS PREVENTED A WRECK.  FORD HAS, ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, FLASHED THE COMPUTER AND REPLACED PARTS AND DID EXTEND THE WARRANTY ON THE TRANSMISSION SLIGHTLY.  HOWEVER, THE TRANSMISSION IS SLIGHTLY NOW OUT OF WARRANTY AND CONTINUES TO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH FAILING TO ACCELERATE AND THEN VIOLENTLY SLAMMING INTO GEAR.  FORD HAS REFUSED TO COVER FURTHER REPAIR OF THE DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION DESPITE CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THE CONTINUED DEFECTIVENESS OF THE TRANSMISSION.",
