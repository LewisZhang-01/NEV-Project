        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING HOME GOING STRAIGHT ON A CITY STREET DOING ABOUT 40MPH WHEN MY STEERING WHEEL LOCKED UP  POWER STEERING ASSIST FAULT MESSAGE CAME UP ON MY INSTRUMENT PANEL.  I LEFT OF THE GAS AND MUSCLED THE STEERING WHEEL TO GET TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  OTHER THAN A COUPLE HONKS FROM PEOPLE BEHIND ME THERE WAS NO HARM.  I LOOKED INTO THE PROBLEM AND NOTICED THE RECALL, BUT WHEN I CAME TO YOUR SITE TO CHECK FOR AN OPEN RECALL FOR THE PROBLEM MY VEHICLE DID NOT HAVE AN OPEN RECALL SO THE PRIOR OWNER MUST HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE SERVICED.  MY QUESTION IS IF THE SAME PART FAILS AGAIN DOES FORD HAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR IS IT COMPLETELY MY RESPONSIBILITY?  ALSO, HOW DO I CHECK TO SEE WHEN AND WHERE THE RECALL WAS PERFORMED?",
