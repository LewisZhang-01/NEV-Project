THEY TOLD ME THAT THE AIRBAG MODULE WAS DEFECTIVE AND WAS IN NEED OF REPLACEMENT AT A SIGNIFICANT COST. I ASKED THEM IF THE MANUFACTURER COVERED THIS SINCE AN AIRBAG MODULE WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAD MOVING PARTS NOR WAS IT A PART THAT AN OWNER HAS ACCESS TO. THEY TOLD ME ONLY IF THERE WAS A RECALL ON THAT PART. THEY SAID THAT THERE WERE NO CURRENT RECALLS ON THAT PART BUT I COULD FILE A COMPLAINT WITH NHTSA.",
