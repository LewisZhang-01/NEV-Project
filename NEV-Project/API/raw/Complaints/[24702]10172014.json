LIKE MANY THE O/D LIGHT STARTED FLASHING AND NOW THE ESTIMATE IS AROUND $3000 FOR THE DEALER TO INSTALL A TRANSMISSION.  ONLY HAVE 76,000 MILES.  FORD KNOWS ABOUT THE PROBLEM AS THEY HAVE VARIOUS TECH BULLETINS.  THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO AVOID THE COST OF A RECALL.  THIS IS THE SECOND FORD I HAD FAIL AROUND THIS MILEAGE WITH TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS.  THE DEALER COULD CARE LESS I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD SAY THIS BUT I WILL NEVER BUY A FORD AGAIN!  THEY NEED TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT HERE, DO A SEARCH ONLINE AND YOU WONT BELIEVE HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME ISSUE!  *NM",
