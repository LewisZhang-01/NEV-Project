I THOUGHT I MAY HAVE SET OFF THE CRUISE CONTROL ON THE STEERING WHEEL, SO I PUSHED THE OFF BUTTON.  THE CAR CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE, SO I HIT THE BRAKES, HOPING THAT WOULD TURN OFF THE CRUISE.  THE BRAKES ON THE CAR WERE STIFF AND THE PEDAL WOULD NOT GO DOWN.  THE BRAKES WERE NOT WORKING AT ALL.   I DOWN SHIFTED TO SLOW THE CAR DOWN , THE CAR JUMPED A LITTLE AND SLOWED DOWN A LITTLE.  I DOWN SHIFTED AGAIN AND THE CAR SLOWED DOWN EVEN MORE.  I CONTINUED TO MOVE FORWARD AT APPROX. 40 MILES PER HOUR AND WAS UNABLE TO STOP.  I FINALLY SHIFTED INTO REVERSE, THE CAR JUMPED A FEW TIMES, THE WHEELS SPUN BACKWARDS THUS MAKING THE CAR GO BACKWARDS.  I THEN TURNED THE WHEEL TO THE LEFT WHICH DIRECTED THE CAR INTO THE MEDIAN OF THE EXPRESSWAY.  AS I CRASHED INTO THE MEDIAN BACKWARDS THE CAR STOPPED, BUT THE WHEELS CONTINUED TO SPIN, AND SMOKE WAS COMING FROM THE TIRES.  I THEN TURNED OFF THE IGNITION.   *NLM",
