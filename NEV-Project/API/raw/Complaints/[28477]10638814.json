WHILE DRIVING, THE TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT WILL COME ON THE DIC AND THEN SERVICE STABILITRACK AND THE CAR WOULD DIE DOWN FOR A BRIEF SECOND AND THE RADIO WILL CUT OFF. I MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO A DEALER AND THEY SAID TO DRIVE WITH THE TRACTION CONTROL OFF UNTIL IT GETS IN. NOW IT IS DOING THE SAME THING WITH THE TRACTION CONTROL OFF. IT IS ALSO DOING THIS IN REVERSE! THIS CAR IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY WITH GM, BUT I'M AFRAID THAT I WILL HAVE THE SAME LUCK AS OTHERS ON HERE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS AND NOTHING WILL GET FIXED. I'M ALSO AFRAID THAT THIS WILL OCCUR AT AN EVEN GREATER RATE AND LONGER WHILE DRIVING CAUSING AN ACCIDENT! SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO FIX THIS PROBLEM IN THIS MODEL!  *TR",
