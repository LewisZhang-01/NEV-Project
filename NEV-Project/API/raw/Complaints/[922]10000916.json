        "summary": "I RECENTLY PURCHASED A 4 CYLINDER, 2000 HONDA ACCORD, LX WITH 35000 MILES ON IT.  THE NEXT DAY, I NOTICED THAT THE GAS PEDAL WAS NOT RESPONDING TO SLIGHT FOOT PRESSURE WHEN THE CAR WAS FIRST USED IN THE MORNING.  IT SEEMED TO BE STICKING AND THEN SUDDENLY RESPOND TO FOOT PRESSURE. BECAUSE OF THIS CONDITION, THE CAR WOULD SUDDENLY LURCH FORWARD WHEN PRESSING ON THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER WHO TOLD ME IT WAS AN INHERENT PROBLEM WITH THE 2000 ACCORD AND TOLD ME THERE WAS NO REMEDY OR RECALL FOR THE PROBLEM.  THEY DIDN'T TELL ME THAT WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR.  I THEN TOOK THE CAR TO A LOCAL AUTO SERVICE BUSINESS WHOM I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH FOR OVER 15 YEARS.  THEY TOLD ME THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY A BUILD-UP OF CARBON ON THE ACCELLERATOR LINKAGE- ESPECIALLY IN THE 2000 HONDA.  I HAD HIM CLEAN THE DEPOSIT ($60 PLUS $4.50 FOR CARBON SOLVENT) WHICH IMMEDIATELY REMEDIED THE STICKING.  HE TOLD ME THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE EVERY 10K MILES OR WHEVER IT BECOMES STICKY AGAIN.  I REALLY BELIEVE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND HONDA SHOULD COME UP WITH A CORRECTION AND RECALL OF ALL 2000 ACCORDS THAT MAY BE AFFECTED.  DO I HAVE ANY RECOURSE WITH HONDA?  HAVE YOU RECEIVED ANY OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS?  ANY SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE APPRECIATED.  THANK YOU.",
