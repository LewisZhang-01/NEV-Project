PULLED SO HARD THAT IT FELT LIKE SOMEONE HAD GRABBED THE STEERING WHEEL AND YANKED IT. ANYTIME YOU BRAKE HARD IT PROGRESSIVELY PULLS HARDER TO THE LEFT THE MORE YOU APPLY THE BRAKES. ALSO POWER-STEERING WILL DISAPPEAR AT SLOW SPEEDS MAKING IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN INTO PARKING LOTS.  DEALER  HAD VEHICLE FOR OVER 4 WEEKS. THE FORD HOT LINE HAD THE DEALER REPLACE THE FRONT SPRINGS, TIE ROD ENDS, STEERING BOX, POWER STEERING PUMP, CHECK ALIGNMENT,TRY DIFFERENT ALIGNMENT SPECS, BALANCE & ROTATE TIRES, SWAPPED CALIPERS FROM SIDE TO SIDE, PUT NEW CALIPERS AND PADS ON. DEALER DROVE TWO OTHER EXCURSION'S  ONE NEW ONE & ANOTHER CUSTOMER'S AND THEY BOTH DID THE SAME THING. FORD HOT LINE HAS ADMITTED TO DEALERSHIP THEY KNOW OF PROBLEM BUT DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO TRY.  *JB",
