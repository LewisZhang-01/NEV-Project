THIS WAS CAUSED BY PINCHING BETWEEN THE ANTI-SWAY BAR ASSEMBLY AND THE FRAME.  THE WIRING WAS ROUTED IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO CAUSE THIS PROBLEM.  HAD I NOT NOTICED THIS, AND FURTHER FRAYING OF WIRES OCCURRED, THE SAFETY BREAK-AWAY BRAKING SYSTEM WOULD FAIL.  THERE HAS THANKFULLY BEEN NO ACCIDENT, BUT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY, DEALER AND FACTORY ASSUME NO LIABILITY, THOUGH THE WIRING WAS PLACED IN THIS POSITION BEFORE I PURCHASED THE NEW TRAILER.  THE WIRING WAS ALSO PAINTED TO MATCH THE FRAMEWORK, THUS WAS LESS NOTICEABLE. *NM",
