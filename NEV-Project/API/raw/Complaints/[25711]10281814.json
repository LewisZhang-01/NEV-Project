I HAVE A 100,000 MILE OR 5 YEAR WARRANTY AND SATURN IS SAYING IT'S NOT COVERED UNDER MY WARRANTY BECAUSE THE POWER STEERING IS ELECTRIC.  NOW I'VE THAT'S A COMMON PROBLEM WITH SATURN.  AND I'M SORRY BUT IT'S VERY DANGEROUS DRIVING WITHOUT POWER STEERING.  SO DOES THIS MEAN EVERY 3 YEARS I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PAY 700 HUNDRED DOLLARS TO HAVE IT FIXED.  THE POWER STEERING CUTS IN AND OUT AND SOMETIMES WHILE I'M TURNING.  I COULD GET SLAMMED BY ANOTHER CAR BECAUSE ALL THE SUDDEN MY CAR LOSES IT'S POWER STEERING. *TR",
