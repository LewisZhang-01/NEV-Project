I HAD NOT HAD ANY INDICATION OF A PROBLEM UP UNTIL THAT DAY. I WENT TO THE DEALER WHO SAID IS WAS SOME FUEL SENSOR THAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED THAT WOULD BE 400.00 TO FIX (WHICH I PRICED I A DIFFERENT REPAIR SHOP AND IT WAS ~ 30 DOLLARS CHEAPER). I DECLINED TO GET IT FIXED RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE THE MONEY. A FEW DAYS LATER, THE SERVICE ENGINE SOON LIGHT WENT OFF AND THE GAUGE WAS WORKING AGAIN, BUT THEN THE LIGHT CAME BACK ON AGAIN AFTER I FILLED MY CAR UP AGAIN. I HOPE THAT THIS PART WILL GET RECALLED SINCE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH THIS PART IN THEIR VEHICLE. MY CAR HAS A LITTLE UNDER 70,000 MILES ON IT.  *TR",
