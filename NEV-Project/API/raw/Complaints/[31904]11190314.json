THE BRAKES EITHER NEED TO BE MATCHED WITH EXTREME FORCE OR THE BRAKES WILL SLAM BY BARELY TOUCHING THE BRAKE PEDAL.  TOYOTA ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE AND OFFERED A WARRANTY EXTENSION TO OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE. I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AFTER THE EXTENSION WAS OFFERED AND HAVEN'T HAD ISSUES UNTIL RECENTLY. I AM CONCERNED FOR NOT ONLY MY SAFETY BUT THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY.  I HAVE BEEN A TOYOTA FAN FOR ALL OF MY ADULT LIFE. HOWEVER, AFTER DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE AND BEING QUOTED $2000 TO FIX IT, I WOULD OFFER ADVICE TO ANYBODY OR NOT TO BUY A TOYOTA OR AT LEAST NOT A TOYOTA HYBRID. BUYER AND DRIVER BEWARE!",
