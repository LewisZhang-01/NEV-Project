        "summary": "2000 TUNDRA WAS PURCHASED AT 47,000 MILES.  WITHIN 1000 MILES, A SEVERE VIBRATION DEVELOPED WHENEVER THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED AT SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF 40 MILES PER HOUR.  AS THE VIBRATION INCREASED, I NOTICED A FAIRLY SEVERE INCREASE IN BRAKING DISTANCE AS WELL.  AFTER A NEAR COLLISION, I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN FOR SERVICE.  THE DEALER ALERTED ME THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH BRAKES ON THE TUNDRA, HOWEVER THEY SIMPLY RESURFACED THE ROTORS AND INFORMED ME THAT THE PADS WERE AT 75%.  WITHIN 1000 MILES, I AGAIN DEVELOPED THE SAME PROBLEM.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN AGAIN AND AGAIN THE DEALER ACKNOWLEDGED THE PROBLEM, BUT SIMPLY RESURFACED THE ROTORS AND INSTALLED NEW PADS AT MY EXPENSE.  THE SERVICE MANAGER ATTEMPTED TO HAVE TOYOTA PAY TO PERFORM THE WORK WHICH WAS LISTED IN SERVICE BULLETINS # BR00302, BR00402, HOWEVER, TOYOTA REFUSED CITING THAT MY TRUCK HAD IN EXCESS OF 36,000 MILES.  THE BILL FOR THIS WORK WAS QUOTED AS $1700.   IT IS NOW 1000 MILES SINCE MY MOST RECENT SERVICE, AND AGAIN THE VIOLENT SHAKING AND INCREASED STOPPING DISTANCE HAS RETURNED.",
