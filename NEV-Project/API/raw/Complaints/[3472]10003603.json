        "summary": "2003 NISSAN ALTIMA WITH 3,539 MILES ON JAN 17TH MY WIFE DROVE IT OUT FOR THE GROCERY SHOPPING. WHEN SHE CAME BACK SHE PARKED THE CAR ON THE DRIVE WAY IN 'P' WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING AS SHE WAS TO GO OUT AFTER UNLOADING THE SHOPPING BAGS FROM THE TRUNK. SHE GOT OFF FROM THE CAR AND OPENED THE TRUNK AND UNLOADED THE SHOPPING BAGS AND TOOK THEM TO THE KITCHEN THROUGH THE GARAGE. SHE TOOK FEW BAGS EACH TIME TO THE KITCHEN SO SHE TRAVELED FEW TIMES FROM THE CAR TO THE KITCHEN. THEN SHE WALKED TO THE MAILBOX AND THEN TOOK THE LAST BAG FROM THE TRUNK AND AFTER CLOSING THE TRUNK WALKED TO THE KITCHEN. SOON LATER SHE OPENED THE KITCHEN DOOR AND WALKED INTO THE GARAGE WHEN SHE NOTICED THAT THE CAR WAS COMING TOWARD HER. IT HAPPENED SO FAST AND AS SHE LOOKED AT THE CAR SHE GOT PARALISED AND THE CAR BUMPED INTO THE WATER HEATER BASE AND STOPPED WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING AND IN 'P'. MY WIFE DIDN'T GET HURT BY 1/16\" OR SO... MY DAUGHTER RAN TO THE CAR TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED AND VERIFIED IF THE CAR WAS IN 'P' OR NOT. IT WAS IN 'P' AND THE INDICATOR LIGHT ON THE PANEL SHOWING 'P' TOO!! I TOOK SOME PICTURES OF IT SINCE THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO AT THAT MOMENT. MY WIFE WAS IN SHOCK. SO I STAYED WITH HER THAT EVENING AND RIGHT NEXT DAY EARLY MORNING TOOK THE CAR TO THE NISSAN DEALER AND REPORTED THE PROBLEM. THE SERVICE DEPT CHECKED IT OUT AND SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR AND TOLD ME AND TO MY WIFE AND MY DAUGHTER THAT WE HAVE TO USE OUR INSURANCE TO FIX THE DAMAGES CAUSED TO THE CAR AND THE HOUSE BY THE MALFUNCTION OF THE CAR.  NO FURTHER ACTION WAS TAKEN BY THE NISSAN DEALER REGARDING THIS ISSUE ALTHOUGH I REQUESTED TO CONTACT NISSAN USA CORP TO REPORT THE PROBLEM.",
