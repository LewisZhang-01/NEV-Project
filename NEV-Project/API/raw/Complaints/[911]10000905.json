SHOULD THIS FAILURE OCCUR AS A RESULT OF A CRASH, THE OCCUPANTS OF THE BACKSEATS CANNOT EXIT THE VEHICLE WITHOUT HAVING TO CRAWL OVER THE FRONT SEATS (WHICH MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE, BASED ON THE SEVERITY OF THE CRASH...).  IN MY CASE, THE TWO, SEPARATE FAILURES WERE NOT THE RESULT OF ACCIDENTS, BUT BOTH REAR DOOR MECHANISMS DID FAIL (AT DIFFERENT OCCASIONS...), WHICH RESULTED IN LOSS OF ABILITY TO USE THE BACK SEATS FOR OCCUPANT USAGE IN THE METHOD DESIGNED/INTENDED.  ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP'S SERVICE CENTER (SUPERSTITION SPRINGS TOYOTA, MESA, AZ), THE ELECTRICAL SOLONOID THAT CONTROLS THE LOCK MECHANISM CAN FAIL, CAUSING THE LOSS OF OPERABILITY (AT A COST OF $300 TO REPLACE), AND REQUIRES REPLACEMENT OF THE ENTIRE LOCK/LATCH MECHANISM. THE SAME MECHANISM IS ALSO USED ON THE FRONT DOORS, AS WELL.",
