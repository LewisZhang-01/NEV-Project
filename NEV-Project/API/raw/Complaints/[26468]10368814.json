THE ENTIRE JEEP STARTED SHAKING VIOLENTLY AS IF THE WHEELS WERE COMING OFF. I HAD TO APPLY THE BRAKES, TURN ON EMERGENCY FLASHERS AND SLOWED DOWN TO ABOUT 25 MPH. THE WRANGLER EVENED OUT AFTER SLOWING DOWN TO 25MPH ON I-95.  THE STEERING WHEEL, BEING ALMOST UNCONTROLLABLE, COULD HAVE CAUSED LIVES LOST.  PLEASE DON'T WAIT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE NOW.  THIS IS A STOCK JEEP. THANK YOU.",
