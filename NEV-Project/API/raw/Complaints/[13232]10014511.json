THE CAR HAS BEEN AT THE DEALER 6 TIMES AND JUST NOW SUBARU IS ADMITTING TO HAVING OTHER CARS WITH THIS ISSUE. ALL 2003 6 CYLINDER ENGINES. I WAS TOLD AFTER THE 4TH TIME AT THE DEALER THAT THEY CANNOT FIX IT, END OF STORY. THEN AFTER FILING A COMPLAINT WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE THEY ARE WORKING ON IT AGAIN. THEY ARE NOW STARTING TO REPLACE STUFF AND WANT TO PUT A BLACK BOX IN.  THIS CAR SHUTS OFF ONLY AT A STAND STILL SO FAR BUT THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS. SUBARU ADMITS TO HAVING MORE CARS LIKE THIS AND THEY ONLY COULD FIX HALF OF THEM.   *JB",
