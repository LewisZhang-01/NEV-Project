THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME TYPE OF SHORTAGE IN THE LINE BECAUSE I HAVE PURCHASED MORE BULBS THAN I WOULD LIKE TO REMEMBER.  I HAVE ALSO RECEIVED ONE CITATION AS WELL AS TWO WARNINGS IN REFERENCE TO THE BROKEN TAIL LIGHT. RECENTLY I SAW THAT THE MORE NEWER MODELS OF THE CAVALIER HAVE BEEN RECALLED TO FIX THE TAIL LIGHT BUT NOT THE LATER ONES. HOPEFULLY THIS COMPLAINT WILL HELP TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEMS THAT I HAVE BEEN HAVING.*AK",
