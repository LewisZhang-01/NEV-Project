WHEN PULLING OUT FROM A STOP THE CAR WILL NOT TAKE THE GAS UNTIL THE GAS PEDAL IS DOWN TO ABOUT HALF THROTTLE AT WHICH TIME IT WILL LUNGE AND I MUST LET OFF THE GAS PEDAL ONLY TO REPEAT THE PROCESS UNTIL THE SPEED REACHES ABOUT 30 MPH. VERY DANGEROUS. THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL, 2005-2014 FORD MUSTANG. I HAVE THREE OF THESE AND THEY ALL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AND THE PREVIOUS OWNERS SAY THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN THERE SINCE THE MILEAGE WAS PRETTY LOW. HOW MANY MUST DIE OR BE INJURED BEFORE SOMEONE FORCES A RECALL FOR REPAIRS ON THESE VEHICLES?",
