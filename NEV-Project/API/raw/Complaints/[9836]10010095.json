WHEN I DRIVE INTO MY PARENTS DRIVE WAY MY PARENTS TELL ME THAT THEY KNOW I AM THERE BECAUSE OF THE RADIO INTERFERENCE ON THE TV SCREEN. I KNOW A LOT ABOUT ELECTRICITY AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS CAUSED BY NOISE AND OR SHORTS, BAD CONNECTIONS WHAT HAVE YOU. I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE CAR HAS RESISTOR PLUGS. WE HAVE ALSO REPLACED THE COMPUTER ONCE AND NOW THIS RECALL THING! WE ALSO HAD TO REPLACE THE REAR SPRINGS.  WHEN ITS REALLY COLD OUT AND GO TO START THE CAR THE STARTER DOES NOT DISENGAGE AND GRINDS ON THE FLY WHEEL. IT TAKES FOREVER FOR IT TO WARM UP AND IT DOES NOT RARELY EVER WARM UP WHEN ITS IDLING YOU HAVE TO DRIVE IT TO GET ANY HEAT. BUT OVERALL ITS ONLY LEFT MY WIFE STRANDED ONCE. THAT'S BETTER THAN OUR LAST VEHICLE!! BUT NOW I WONDER IF THIS CAR IS A TICKING TIME BOMB WAITING TO HAPPEN. FORD MAY NOT BE MY NEXT CHOICE OF VEHICLE IN THE FUTURE THAT IS IF IT DOESN'T KILL ME FIRST! *JB",
