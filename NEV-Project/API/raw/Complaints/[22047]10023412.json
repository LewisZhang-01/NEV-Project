AFTER SOME RAIN STORMS I HAD NOTICED THAT THE TRUNK WAS LEAKING A LOT AND THERE WAS A LOT OF WATER GATHERED IN THE SPARE TIRE COMPARTMENT AND THE MAT AND CARPET WERE STARTING TO SMELL.  I TOOK IT INTO ACADEMY NISSAN AND THEY GAVE ME A BIG STORY WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE COVERED... IN THE END IT WAS COVERED BUT IT TOOK 4 DAYS TO GET MY CAR BACK AND ALL THEY DID WAS BEND THE TRUNK , NOW IT HITS THE BUMPER WHEN IT CLOSES AND IS NOT PARALLEL TO THE GROUND MAKING IT LOOK UNCENTERED.  I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THEIR WORKMANSHIP OR THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I PLAN ON DEALING WITH HIGHER MANAGEMENT UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED.    *NLM",
