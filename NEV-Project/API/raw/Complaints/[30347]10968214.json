TOTAL LOSS OF STEERING! IT HAPPENED WHILE IN REVERSE, DRIVING FORWARD AND UPON STARTING. IN MY DRIVEWAY, AND IN CITY STREETS AND WHILE TURNING. I WAS NOT GOING FAST AND WAS WATCHING FOR IT. WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO THOSE WHO AREN'T WATCHING FOR IT?  APPARENTLY IT IS A MANUFACTURING ISSUE AS TONS OF OTHER OWNERS ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE. THIS IS MY CHILDS CAR (WHICH I WILL NOT LET HER DRIVE) AND I FIND IT TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT FORD HAS NOT RECALLED THIS HUGE SAFETY ISSUE!",
