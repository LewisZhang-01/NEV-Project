        "summary": "MY DAUGHTER WAS RETURNING HOME FROM COLLEGE AND LOST CONTROL OF HER VEHICLE ON I-85 IN SOUTH CAROLINA, CROSSED THE MEDIAN AND CRASHED INTO TWO TRACTOR TRAILERS AND DIED AT THE SCENE. SOUTH CAROLINA HIGHWAY PATROL INVESTIGATED THE ACCIDENT AND DETERMINED SHE WAS TRAVELING IN EXCESS OF 90 MPH AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT. THIS IS NOT A SPEED MY DAUGHTER WOULD TRAVEL AT. WITNESSES ALSO SAID SHE WAS PASSING PEOPLE ON THE EMERGENCY LANE ON THE RIGHT SIDE WHILE TRAVELING AT A HIGH SPEED, WHICH IS SOMETHING SHE WOULD NOT DO EITHER. I BELIEVE THE CAR WAS ACCELERATING AND SHE COULD NOT STOP IT AND WAS DRIVING ON THE SHOULDER TO AVOID HITTING ANYONE WITH HER OUT OF CONTROL CAR. THE EMERGENCY LANE ENDED AND SHE HAD TO RE-ENTER THE TRAVEL LANE BUT LOST CONTROL AND CROSSED THE MEDIAN. MY DAUGHTER HAS BEEN DRIVING FOR TWO YEARS AND HAS THOUSANDS OF MILES OF EXPERIENCE AND WOULD NOT DRIVE IN THIS MANNER, UNLESS SHE COULD NOT CONTROL THE VEHICLE. SHE COMPLETED DRIVERS EDUCATION AND HAS HAD NO MOVING VIOLATIONS OF ANY KIND SINCE SHE HAS BEEN DRIVING.  *TR",
