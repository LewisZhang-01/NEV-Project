THEY STATED THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON ERRORS AND WHEN WE CHECKED THE EVENFLO GUIDE, WE FOUND THE CONFLICTING INSTRUCTIONS. SINCE WE HAD USED THE CHECKLIST TO COMPLETE OUR INSTALLATION, WE HAD THE HARNESS STRAPS ADJUSTED TO SHOULDER HEIGHT RATHER THAT IN THE TOP POSITION.   WE HAVE CORRECTED THE HARNESS POSITION, BUT ARE CONCERNED THAT OTHER PARENTS MAY HAVE MADE THE SAME MISTAKE BASED ON THE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED IN THE EVENFLO GUIDE.*JB",
