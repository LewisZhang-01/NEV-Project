I WAS JUST A FEW MINUTES FROM MY HOME SO I DECIDED TO KEEP DRIVING THE CAR TILL I GOT THERE.  THE TRANNY WOULD JERK THE CAR INTO SECOND GEAR AND THEN SLIP INTO THIRD.  AT ONE POINT I WAS GOING ABOUT 50 MPH AND THE CAR SHIFTED UNEXPECTEDLY INTO SECOND GEAR.  I FELT A BIG JOLT BUT WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL.  THE SHIFT LASTED ABOUT 4 SECONDS WHEN SUDDENLY THE TRANNY UPSHIFTED TO THIRD GEAR.  THIS MADE ME THINK WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPEN IF THIS HAD OCCUR IN THE HIGHWAY WHEN THE AVERAGE SPEED IS ABOUT 65MPH.  THE CAR DID GIVE ME ADVANCE WARNING THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS FAILING BUT I NEVER THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD DOWNSHIFT LIKE THAT.  I REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE TRANNY MAY SOMEDAY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT THAT RESULTS IN INJURY OR DEATH.  MY ACURA CL HAS ONLY 21,400 MILES.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP.",
