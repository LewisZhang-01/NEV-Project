LESS THAN 60 DAYS LATER, THE OIL COOLER LINE FELL APART AND ALL OIL DRAINED FROM THE ENGINE IN 30-60 SECONDS, CAUSING COMPLETE ENGINE FAILURE.  THE VEHICLE SEIZED UP IN TRAFIC IN A DANGEROUS AREA AND THERE WAS NOT TIME TO DRIVE TO A SAFE AREA TO INSPECT THE VEHICLE.  THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHO TOLD US THAT THIS WAS A FACTORY DEFECT AND SUGGESTED THAT WE CONTACT THE DEALER AS THE ENGINE MUST BE REPLACED.  THE DEALER CONTACTED CHEVROLET WHO HAS DECLINED ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND KNOWLEDGE OF THIS PROBLEM, YET THERE ARE NUMEROUS CONSUMER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE OIL HOSE.  DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED LESS THAN 60 DAYS BEFORE, WE NOW ARE FACING A REPAIR BILL THAT IS HALF THE COST OF THE VEHICLE AND THE DEALER'S RESPONSE WAS \"TOO BAD.\"",
