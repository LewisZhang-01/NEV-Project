THE DEALER INFORMED US THAT THIS WAS PIRELLI AND WE MUST CONTACT THEM. I DID AND WAS TOLD TO SEE A AUTHORIZED PIRELLI DEALER. BROUGHT THE CAR IN WAITED AND THEN TOLD ME THEY WILL ONLY TAKE 20%OFF. WHILE  I WAITED FOR TIRE DEALER TO RETURN MY CALL BUBBLES FORMED IN THE TIRES. THIS CAN'T BE SAFE . VOLVO PRIDES THEMSELVES ON SAFE CARS. HOW SAFE CAN THEY BE WITH BAD TIRES. PIRELLI  AND VOLVO BETTER WATCH OUT. REMEMBER FORD AND FIRESTONE. THEY ARE ONLY A FEW MILES BEHIND. NO FATALITIES YET!!!*JB",
