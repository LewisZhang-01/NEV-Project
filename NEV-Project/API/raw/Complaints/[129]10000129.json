THIS HAPPENED BEFORE WHILE I WAS DRVING AROUND TOWN AND THE SERVICE DEALER DECLARED THE PROBLEM FIXED EACH TIME I REPORTED IT.  WHEN I TOOK THE CAR IN THIS TIME AROUND THE DEALER IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY SAID IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING TO OTHERS.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION AND OWNERS OF THESE CARS SHOULD BE NOTIFIED IMMEDIATELY.  I NARROWLY ESCAPED A COLLISION WHILE TRAVELLING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED.  I HAVE NOTIFIED MERCEDES BENZ WHO ARE CLAIMING THAT NHTSA DOES NOT DEEM THIS TO BE A PROBLEM.",
