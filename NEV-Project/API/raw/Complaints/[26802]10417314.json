THERE WERE THREE INCIDENTS ON 7/25/2011 THAT THE CAR ACCELERATED WHILE I HAD MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE. IN EACH INCIDENT I WAS STOPPED AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT WITH MY RIGHT FOOT ON THE BRAKE PEDAL. WHILE MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE, THE ENGINE SPEED UP AND I HAD TO APPLY EXTREME PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE TO PREVENT THE CAR FROM MOVING FORWARD. IN ONE INCIDENT I COULD ONLY STOP THE CAR FROM MOVING FORWARD BY SHIFTING INTO NEUTRAL AND WATCHING THE TACHOMETER RED LINE. THE CAR OPERATED NORMALLY AFTER THE LIGHT TURNED TO GREEN AND I WAS ABLE TO THROUGH THE CAR INTO DRIVE AND PRESS DOWN ON THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL. I REPORTED IT TO HERTZ, BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY DID ANYTHING.",
