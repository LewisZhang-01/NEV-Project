WITHIN 20K MILES THE ROTORS WERE SEVERELY WARPED, HOT SPOTTED AND HAD SMALL CRACKS IN SEVERAL PLACES ON BOTH SIDES OF EACH ROTOR. WHEN THEY WERE TURNED,  \"SOFT\" SPOTS WERE REVEALED IN THE METAL AND BOTH ROTORS - EVEN WHEN TURNED DOWN ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE MINIMUM THICKNESS. THEY WERE DEEMED UNSALVAGEABLE AND I HAD TO GET ANOTHER NEW SET LESS THAN A YEAR AFTER RECALL REPLACEMENTS WERE INSTALLED.      THE INCIDENT DATE IS APPROXIMATE. I WILL NEED TO FIND THE RECEIPTS TO KNOW THE EXACT DATES.  TS",
