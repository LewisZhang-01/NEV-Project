        "summary": "LAST MAY, I HAVE PURCHASED A 2014 MDX( TECH+ADVANCED) AT ACURA DEALERSHIP IN VALENCIA,CA. ITS CURRENT MILEAGE CLOCKS AT 7200 MILES. SO FAR, I HAVE VISITED THE DEALERSHIP FOR MAINTENANCE REQUEST FOR OVER 10 OCCASIONS.I HAVE RECENTLY NOTICED THE A/C INDICATOR RANDOMLY BLINK .AND NOW AFTER DRIVING 6,500 MILES MY ENGINE STARTED MAKING THIS CRICKETING SOUND INSIDE. BUT, THE SERVICE MANAGER I SPOKE TO STILL SAYS IT'S NORMAL.HE SAID ALL 2014, 2015 MDX ARE LIKE THAT. BUT I CAN'T HELP TO EXPRESS MY CONCERN OVER THIS. IT THIS WAS NORMAL, THE SOUND SHOULD'VE BEEN AROUND SINCE I FIRST PURCHASED THE CAR INSTEAD OF AFTER 6,500 MILES OF DRIVING. AT THIS MOMENT THE SOUND HAS BEEN GROWING AS WELL. ANYWAY I HAVE LEFT MY CAR AFTER RECEIVING A CALL FROM THE VALENCIA DEALERSHIP TO FIX THE ISSUES OF MY VEHICLE ON OCT.21  I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THE FOLLOWING TO BE RESOLVED:  FIRST, THE AIR CONDITIONING WILL BE FULLY REPLACED THE A/C UNIT FOR THE A/C MONITOR LIGHT THAT HAS BEEN ONE.   SECOND, IN-DEPTH CHECKUP FOR THE CRICKETING SOUND FROM MY ENGINE.  HOWEVER, ON NOV 4 AFTER RECEIVING BACK MY MDX, I NOTICED THE A/C MONITOR BACK ON AND AGAIN, AND THE CRICKETING SOUND CAME BACK.  I WENT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP IN SEARCH OF ANSWERS ON EXACTLY WHAT THEY HAVE FIXED', AND THEIR RESPONSE WAS THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO REPLACE THE A/C AND THE ENGINE SOUND IS NORMAL.  I ALSO CONTACTED HONDA CORPORATE OFFICE ON THE  NOV 12TH AND I WAS INFORMED THAT THE A/C WAS IN FACT NOT REPLACED AND REARRANGED THE PLACEMENT OF THE ENGINE TO MINIMIZE THE CRICKETING SOUND.   OUR FAMILY FEEL VERY CHEATED WITH THESE RESPONSES WHEN I WAS PROMISED THAT THE A/C WILL BE FIXED, AND ENGINE SOUND WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH VARIOUS WAYS LIKE WATER PUMP REPLACEMENT.  WHAT UPSETS ME MOST IS THAT THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT MAKE ACTUAL EFFORT TO AT LEAST TRY TO RESOLVE THEIR CUSTOMER'S CONCERNS.  *TR",
