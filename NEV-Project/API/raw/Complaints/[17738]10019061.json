THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE --THE CAR CAN DIE AT ANY MOMENT, AT ANY SPEED, UNDER ANY CONDITIONS-- BUT APPARENTLY THE AGENCY DOES NOT CARE.  I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR ANY DISTANCE GREATER THAN 20 MILES FOR FEAR OF BEING STRANDED FOR HOURS (I LIVE IN A RURAL AREA).  VW HAS BEEN UNRESPONSIVE, ESSENTIALLY TELLING CONSUMERS THAT THEY MUST WAIT UNTIL A FAILURE OCCURS BEFORE A FIX WILL BE OFFERED.  THIS PLACES MANY AT RISK NEEDLESSLY.  I WOULD APPRECIATE A FOLLOW-UP AS TO WHY THERE IS NO ACTION BEING TAKEN.  *JB",
