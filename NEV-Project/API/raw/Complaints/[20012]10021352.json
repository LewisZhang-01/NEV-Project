REALIZED BRAKES WERE NOT ENGAGING AS I WAS QUICKLY APPROACHING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME, THEN REALIZED OIL LIGHT AND ENGINE LIGHT WERE ON AND NO RESPONSE TO INCREASED GAS PEDAL PRESSURE ON RPM GAUGE TO TRY TO MOVE CAR OUT OF LANE. LUCKILY HAPPENED TO BE IN FAR LEFT LANE AND HAD JUST ENOUGH ROOM TO COAST OVER TO SHOULDER AND APPLY PARKING BRAKE TO STOP. REMOVED KEYS, REINSERTED AND CAR STARTED RIGHT UP. THIS IS THE FIRST OCCURRENCE - HOWEVER I PERUSE THE NHTSA SIGHT OCCASIONALLY AND REMEMBERED READING  ABOUT THIS SITUATION FROM A FEW YEARS AGO. I HAVE NOT CONTACTED THE DEALER YET - WANTED TO REVIEW THIS SIGHT FIRST TO SEE IF ANY ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN YET - APPARENTLY NOT. THANK GOD A GUARDIAN ANGEL WAS ON MY SHOULDER THIS MORNING.*AK",
