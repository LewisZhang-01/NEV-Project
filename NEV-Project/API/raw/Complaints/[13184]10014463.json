        "summary": "APPROXIMATELY 3-4 WEEKS AGO I WAS DRIVING MY 2000 FORD F150 PICKUP ON I96 DURING RUSH HOUR IN LANSING, MI.  THERE WAS A SUDDEN THUNDERSTORM WITH HAIL.  I TURNED MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS ON THE FASTEST SPEED AND AFTER APPROXIMATELY 2- 3 MINUTES THE PASSENGER SIDE WIPER GOT OUT OF SYNC AND JAMMED UNDER THE DRIVER SIDE WIPER CAUSING BOTH OF THEM TO STOP WORKING.  TRAFFIC WAS GOING FAIRLY FAST AND I LOST WHAT VISIBILITY I DID HAVE.  FORTUNATELY I WAS GOING BY AN EXIT AND COULD QUICKLY GET OFF THE EXPRESSWAY TO WAIT OUT THE STORM.  WHEN I GOT HOME FROM WORK I TOOK THE COVER OFF THE PASSENGER WIPER AND HAD TO TIGHTEN THE NUT THAT HOLDS IT ON.  THEY HAVE WORKED FINE SINCE THEN BUT I WOULD NOT WANT TO HAVE THIS SAME THING HAPPEN TO SOMEONE ELSE IF THEY ARE ON AN EXPRESSWAY DURING A THUNDERSTORM.  (PS:  THE INCIDENT DATE I BUT ON THE FORM IS APPROXIMATE.  I DIDN'T THINK OF REPORTING THIS UNTIL I HEARD AN NHTSA COMMERCIAL TODAY SAYING TO REPORT SAFETY INCIDENTS.).   *NLM",
