YOU THEN HAVE TO PUT THE VEHICLE BACK INTO NEUTRAL AND THEN INTO DRIVE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THE VEHICLE. TOOK TO THE DEALER NUMEROUS TIMES AND THEY SAID IT WAS \"NORMAL\". THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AS IF WE ARE BACKING UP ONTO A ROAD OR ANYWHERE BY THAT MEANS AND WE HAVE TO SPEND THE EXTRA TIME PUTTING THE VEHICLE BACK INTO NEUTRAL AND THEN INTO DRIVE IT WASTE VALUABLE TIME. THIS ISSUE DOES NOT OCCUR ALL THE TIME, BUT APPROX 70% OF THE TIME. WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. *TR",
