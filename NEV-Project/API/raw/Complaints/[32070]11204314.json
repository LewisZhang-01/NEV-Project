THIS HAPPENED TO ME 2 TIMES ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY SURROUNDED BY TRUCKS ENDANGERING MY FAMILY AS I COULD NOT CLIMB ABOVE 20MPH AND HAD TO SCRAMBLE TO GET OVER AND NOT BE A HAZARD.   WHILE THE DEALER INITIALLY COULDN'T FIND THE PROBLEM- CHEVY MECHANICS TOLD THEM TO CHECK FOR A SPECIFIC TRIPPED FUSE- THAT RUINS THE WHOLE BOX.  THE PROBLEM IS SO PREVALENT- THE PART IS INDEFINITELY ON BACK ORDER.   THIS IS A POTENTIALLY DEADLY SITUATION.",
