THERE IS A KNOWN DEFECT WITH THE IGNITION COILS   IN 2001 AND 2002 AUDI'S AND VW WITH A 1.8 LITER TURBO ENGINE.  VW REPLACED   THE ONE FAILING COIL BUT REFUSES TO REPLACE, UNDER WARRANTY, THE REMAIN 3   COILS THAT COULD FAIL AT ANY MOMENT.  MY CAR HAS BEEN SERVICED IN THE PAST   FOR SPORADIC MIS-FIRES WHICH MAYBE DUE TO THE REMAINING DEFECTIVE COILS.   WITH HALF A MILLION VEHICLES ON THE ROAD THIS IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.    THE SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER CAN BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS WHILE DRIVING (IE. WHEN   MAKING A LEFT TURN).  VW REFUSES TO COMMIT TO REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE COILS UNTIL   THEY FAIL.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE AND HAVE VW PERFORM A RECALL BEFORE SOMEONE IS   SERIOUSLY INJURED.",
