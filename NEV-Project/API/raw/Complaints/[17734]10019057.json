        "summary": "AUTO LOAD LEVELING SUSPENSION FAILED JUNE 2002. DEALER FOUND WIRING PROBLEM THAT CAUSED SHORT AND CAUSED SENSOR TO FAIL. WHEN SYSTEM FAILS, SYSTEM DROPS REAR OF CAR DOWN ON AXLE WITH NO SUSPENSION. VEHICLE IS VERY UNSAFE TO DRIVE ESPECIALLY OVER ROUGH ROAD AND WHEN CORNERING. I COMPLAINED TO THE DEALER AND FORD THAT THIS WAS A MAJOR PROBLEM AND WOULD BE ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS IF TOWING A TRAILER WHEN THIS HAPPENED.  IN MAY OF 2003 SYSTEM FAILED WHILE TOWING A FAIRLY HEAVY TRAILER. TRAILER TONGUE HIT THE PAVEMENT. VEHICLE WAS VERY UNSTABLE TO DRIVE AND GET SAFELY OFF THE ROAD. THIS TIME THE PROBLEM WAS A RELAY THAT FAILED.  VEHICLES WITH THIS LOAD LEVELING SYSTEM NEED TO BE RECALLED AND MODIFIED TO FREEZE THE SYSTEM IN IT'S CURRENT STATE WHEN A FAILURE IS DETECTED AND NOT TO LET OUT ALL OF THE AIR IN THE SUSPENSION. THERE NEEDS TO BE A WAY TO DISABLE THE SYSTEM AND MANUALLY ADD OR REMOVE AIR FROM THE AIR SHOCKS IN THIS SITUATION. I PREFER TO REMOVE THE \"AUTOMATIC\" CONTROL FROM THIS SYSTEM AND CONTROL IT MANUALLY. *JB",
