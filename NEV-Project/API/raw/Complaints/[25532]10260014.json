I TOOK IT TO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP WHERE THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE SEAT FRAME WAS BROKEN AND THAT THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED TO THE TUNE OF 1030.00. WHEN I GOOGLED THIS INFO I REALIZED THAT MURANO OWNERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WERE HAVING THIS PROBLEM. SOME OF THEM HAD THE PROBLEM FIXED ONLY TO HAVE IT HAPPEN AGAIN. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A DESIGN DEFECT THAT NISSAN NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR. DO WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THIS PROBLEM STARTS CAUSING ACCIDENTS AND DEATHS? *TR",
