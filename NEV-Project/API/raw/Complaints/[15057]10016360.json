THEY REPLACED THE PCV VALVE, BUT SAID IT WILL STILL BURN 1 QUART PER 2000 - 3000 MILES.  THIS IS ABSURD FOR A NEW ENGINE.  WHAT EFFECT WILL THIS HAVE ON ENGINE LONGEVITY? CATALYTIC CONVERTER?  AIR POLLUTION?  I DON'T REMEMBER THIS FEATURE IN THE ADVERTISING OR SALES PITCH. WHAT IS NHTSA DOING ABOUT THIS KNOWN DEFECT?   *NLM",
