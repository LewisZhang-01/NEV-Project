LIKE OTHERS MANY TURN SIGNALS FAILED, I HAVE HAD WATER LEAKS, THE DOME LIGHT FELL OUT OF ITS CASING AND WAS DANGLING BY ITS WIRES.  IN MAY OF 2003 THE COMPUTER AND ITS WIRING WERE REPLACED (AT ONLY 31000) AFTER AN INCIDENT OF VERY RUFF SHIFTING.  A SEPARATE CONSISTANT  PROBLEM THAT REMAINS UNSOLVED IS THE CAR'S OCCASIONAL EPISODES OF NOT WANTING TO START.  DURING THESE EPISODES IT SOUNDS AS IF THE STARTER WILL CRACK, BUT IT JUST WILL NOT START.  THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT STARTED AT THESE TIMES IS TO TAP THE GAS PEDAL!  IT HAS BEEN TAKEN TO TWO DEALERSHIPS FOR THIS PROBLEM.  THEY HAVE REPLACED A FUEL INTAKE VALVE AND PUT NEW PROGRAMMING IN THE COMPUTER.  NOTHING THEY EVER DO SOLVES THIS PROBLEM AND USUALLY THEY TELL ME THAT THEY CAN NOT RECREATE THE PROBLEM AND THEREFORE CAN NOT FIX IT.  EVEN AFTER HAVING A NEW COMPUTER THE PROBLEM STILL OCCURS.*AK",
