I'VE HAD THREE STEERING SENSORS AND ONE POWER STEERING BOX REPLACED AND IT IS STILL CLUNKING.  I HAVE HAD ALL FOUR ROTORS CUT, ALL FOUR ROTORS REPLACED AND TWO COMPLETE SETS OF BRAKES PUT ON THE CAR AND I HAD MY CAR INSPECTED TODAY AND I WAS TOLD I NEED ANOTHER SET OF NEW BRAKES.  ALL IN LESS THAN 30,000 MILES.  IF YOU LOOK AT THE SERVICE RECORD ON THIS CAR I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS FROM THE DAY I BOUGHT THE CAR. TS",
