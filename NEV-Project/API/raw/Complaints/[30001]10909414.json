I COASTED TO THE SHOULDER WITH NO POWER.  I CALLED THE FCA RECALL ASSISTANCE CENTER AND THEY SUGGESTED I GET A DIAGNOSTIC DONE.  IF THE PROBLEM IS DUE TO THE S55 TRANSAXLE WIRE HARNESS RECALL, THEN THEY SAID I WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR A LOANER VEHICLE UNTIL THE RECALL PART WAS MADE FOR MY JEEP.  I CALLED MY LOCAL JEEP DEALER AND SET UP AN APPOINTMENT TO GET THE DIAGNOSTIC DONE.  2 DAYS AFTER MY LOSS OF POWER, I GOT A MESSAGE ON MY DASH THAT SAID \"SERVICE 4WD.\"  I'M DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT MY SAFETY, AND THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY IN THIS JEEP.",
