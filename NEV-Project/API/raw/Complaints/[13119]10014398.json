        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 4-DOOR SATURN SL 2002 THIS PAST SUMMER. THE CARS DESIGN IS INCORRECT. WHEN I SIT IN THE SEAT WITH BOTH OF MY HANDS ON THE STEERING WHEEL AND DRIVE, I HAVE TO TURN MY BODY FROM THE WAIST DOWN TO THE LEFT IN ORDER TO PRESS ON THE GAS OR BRAKE. I HAVE NO ROOM ON THE RIGHT SIDE NEXT TO THE GAS PEDAL DUE TO THE CENTER CONSOLE PANEL, IT FORCES ME TO SIT WITH MY WAIST TURNED TO THE LEFT. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION AND I HAVE HAD CONTINUAL BACK PAIN, WHICH BEGAN TWO MONTHS AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR. I HAVE BEEN SEEING A CHIROPRACTOR FOR THE PAST 4 MONTHS.   I SPOKE TO THE DEALER WHOM I PURCHASED THE CAR FROM, AND WAS GIVEN A LETTER STATING THE SEAT WAS POSITIONED CORRECTLY AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.   I BELIEVE I WILL HAVE LONG TERM BACK PAIN IF I CONTINUE TO DRIVE THIS CAR. AS IT IS A NEW CAR AND I WOULD LOOSE $8000 OR $9000 IF I WERE TO SELL IT IMMEDIATELY, I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO DO SO. *JB",
