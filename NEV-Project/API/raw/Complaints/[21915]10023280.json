THIS IS DUE TO THE VALVE BODY ON THE TRANSMISSION WEARING EXCESSIVELY, ALLOWING AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FLUID TO FLOW AROUND A POPPET BEFORE ENGAGING.     SATURN IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND SO ARE THE TRANSMISSION REPAIR PLACES.  SATURN REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM THOUGH THEY HAVE ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN FOR THE PROBLEM AND AT ABOUT $1000 PER REPAIR PER VEHICLE SATURN HAS A VESTED INTEREST IN NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THE PROBLEM.  *NLM",
