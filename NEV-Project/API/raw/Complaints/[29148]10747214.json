I CALLED A TOW TRUCK. TOWED TO LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALER.   AFTER 20 DAYS IN SHOP, THEY REPLACED STEERING COMPUTER, RACK AND PINION STEERING TOO.  I AM APPALLED THAT A NEW (EXPENSIVE) 2015 GENESIS WITH VERY LOW MILEAGE, HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM.  I AM NOW VERY HESITANT ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE HYUNDAI BRAND.  I HOPE NO ONE ELSE HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM, BECAUSE IT IS A REAL HEADACHE!!!",
