        "summary": "1999 DODGE RAM 1500 QUAD CAB TRUCK  - WHEN A BUMP OR ROUGH PATCH IN THE ROAD IS HIT, THE FRONT END BEGINS TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY. WHEEL HOP OCCURS AND THE VEHICLE MUST BE PULLED OFF THE ROAD AND STOPPED COMPLETELY BEFORE THE STEERING RETURNS TO NORMAL - HAPPENS ALMOST EVERYTIME ON THE SAME BUMPS OR PATCHES ON THE SAME ROADS. THE PROBLEM IS SO BAD THE TRUCK IS BASICALLY UNDRIVABLE AND IS A VERY DANGEROUS CONCERN - ONLY 74,000 MILES ON THE TRUCK AND HAVE REPLACED MOST ALL THE FRONTEND PARTS AS WELL AS BRAKE ROTORS, ETC. STILL OCCURS. SEEMS DAIMLER CHRYSLER HAS KNOWN OF THIS ISSUE FOR SOME TIME, BUT HAS DONE NOTHING TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. I AM AWARE OF SERVERAL WRECKS DUE TO THIS ISSUE AND THERE IS EVEN A WEBSITE THAT ADDRESS THE ISSUES APPARENTLY MANY PPL ARE HAVING - HTTP://WWW.DODGETRUCKSTEERINGPROBLEMS.COM/  CHRYSLER HAS DONE NOTHING TO OFFER ASSISTANCE AND THE DEALER REFUSES TO RESOLVE THE ISSUES WITHOUT HAVINGTO PAY THEM ALLOT OF MONEY AND STILL IT DOES NOT GET RESOLVED.",
