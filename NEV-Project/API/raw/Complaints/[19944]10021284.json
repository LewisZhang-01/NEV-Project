        "summary": "SOME GM PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MY 2001 GMC YUKON, DO NOT COME WITH A DOOR AJAR WARNING SYSTEM.  GM HAS WRITTEN, INDICATING THAT THERE IS A \"STANDARD\" DOOR AJAR WARNING SYSTEM WHEN THERE IS NOT.  GM HAS MADE AN APPARENT MISREPRESENTATION, FOOLING CUSTOMERS INTO BELIEVING THAT THE COURTESY DOME LIGHT SYSTEM (WHICH TURNS ON WHEN THE DOOR IS OPEN) IS A DOOR AJAR WARNING SYSTEM.   I HAVE SEEN OTHER  INTERNET COMPLAINTS REGARDING THIS SYSTEM IN GM PRODUCTS.  IT POSES A GRAVE DANGER TO OCCUPANTS.  IS THERE LEGISLATION REGARDING A DOOR AJAR WARNING SYSTEM AND CAN ANYTHING BE DONE ABOUT GM?  BELOW ARE EXAMPLES OF WHAT  CAN OR HAS OCCURRED. A DRIVER ENTERS A YUKON ALONG WITH THREE PASSENGERS.  THE DOME  LIGHT WILL TURN ON NO MATTER WHAT AT THIS JUNCTURE BECAUSE THE DOORS WERE  OPENED, SO THERE WOULD NOT BE CAUSE FOR ALARM AS DOORS CLOSE.  ONE OF THE  THREE PASSENGERS DOES NOT CLOSE HIS/HER DOOR COMPLETELY.  THE DRIVER PUTS  THE KEY IN THE IGNITION AND STARTS THE VEHICLE.  THE LIGHT TURNS OFF.  NO DOOR AJAR WARNING.  ANOTHER EXAMPLE:  I OPENED A REAR PASSENGER DOOR OF MY YUKON AND THE DRIVER'S DOOR.  THE DOME LIGHT TURNED ON, BECAUSE IT IS APPARENTLY A STANDARD FEATURE FOR THE LIGHT TO COME ON WHEN A DOOR IS OPENED FOR PEOPLE TO GET IN AND OUT.  I THEN PUSHED THE PASSENGER DOOR TOWARDS IT'S HOUSING JUST ENOUGH FOR METAL TO TOUCH METAL (OR THE APPARENT SENSOR), BUT STILL \"OPEN\" IN THAT, WITHOUT ENGAGING THE DOOR OPENING MECHANISM, I COULD STILL PULL IT OPEN.  I THEN ENTERED THE VEHICLE  THROUGH THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR AND CLOSED IT (ONLY THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR).  I PUT THE KEY IN THE IGNITION AND THE DOME LIGHT TURNED OF. ANYONE COULD  HAVE PUSHED OR PULLED THE PASSENGER DOOR OPEN.  EXAMPLE: I BEGAN BACKING OUT OF MY HOUSE ONE DAY WHEN ONE OF THE DOORS BEGAN TO OPEN.  NO DOOR AJAR LIGHT WAS ON.  HAD THIS OCCURRED ON THE OPEN ROAD, A SERIOUS ACCIDENT COULD HAVE RESULTED.  THE DOORS ON THIS SUV ARE ALREADY HEAVY, AND IT IS VERY EASY TO HAVE A DOOR AJAR.*AK",
