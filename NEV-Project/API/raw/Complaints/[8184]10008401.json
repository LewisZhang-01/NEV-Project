UPON INSPECTION, IT WAS REVEALED THAT JEEP HAS RE-DESIGNED THE MECHANISM BY REPLACING A FAILURE PRONE PLASTIC COMPONENT WITH A METAL COMPONENT. HOWEVER, NO RECALL OR NOTICE WAS GIVEN TO OWNERS OF VEHICLES WITH THE FAILURE PRONE PARTS, AND JEEP ALSO CHARGES FOR THE RE-DESIGNED REPLACEMENT ASSEMBLY. I BELIEVE THIS COMPONENT IS ESPECIALLY LIKELY TO FAIL DURING AN ACCIDENT, ESPECIALLY A ROLLOVER TYPE OF ACCIDENT, WHERE THE WINDOW ASSEMBLY WOULD BE SUBJECTED TO A SUDDEN DOWNWARD FORCE. I HAVE DIGITAL PICTURES OF THE OLD AND REVISED COMPONENTS AND CAN EMAIL THEM IF DESIRED. I ALSO HAVE RETAINED A FAILED ORIGINAL COMPONENT. I KNOW THAT THIS IS A COMMON FAILURE ON JEEP CHEROKEES.   *NLM",
