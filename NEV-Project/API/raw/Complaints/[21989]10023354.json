BOTH COBRA'S HAVE AND HAD PROBLEMS WITH STALLING, WHICH CAUSES A NEAR COMPLETE LOSS OF BRAKING POWER (THE BRAKES MUST HAVE THE ENGINE RUNNING IN ORDER FOR THEM TO WORK, UNLIKE SOME VEHICLES), WHICH IS POTENTIALLY EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS TO MY SAFETY, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER VEHICLE, PEDESTRIAN, CHILDREN, OR ANIMAL NEAR ME.  IT HAPPENS ON DECELERATION AT LOW SPEEDS DRIVING AROUND TOWN.  THERE IS A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF DOCUMENTS GOING ON THAT SHOWS NEARLY 40% OR MORE OF 2003 COBRA OWNERS ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES.  FORD HAS UPDATED THE PCM 2 TIMES ALREADY FOR THE 2003 MODEL YEAR, AND THE PROBLEMS STILL EXIST!  HERE IS A LINK TO A SITE WITH MANY OWNERS REPORTING THE PROBLEMS:    HTTP://WWW.SVTPERFORMANCE.COM/FORUMS/SHOWTHREAD.PHP?S=&THREADID=25697.   *NLM",
