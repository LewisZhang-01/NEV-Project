THIS WILL CAUSE ENGINE NOISE, POOR PERFORMANCE, AND OR STALLS WITH NO ENGINE RESTART.  HOWEVER, THEY WILL ONLY REPAIR AFTER THE VEHICLE IS DAMAGED.    I HAVE 2 CHILDREN AND DO NOT THINK IT IS SAFE TO BE DRIVING A VEHICLE THAT COULD STALL AT ANY TIME OR PROVIDE \"POOR PERFORMANCE\".  I HAVE EXPERIENCED MANY PROBLEMS WITH THE 2002 TRAILBLAZER - RANGING FROM THE VEHICLE STOPPING AS I'M GOING 55 MPH, THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT STAYING ON, I'VE RECEIVED 2 RECALL NOTICES AND THEN THIS SPECIAL POLICY NOTICE.  I THINK THE ENGINE SHOULD BE REPLACED FOR THE SAFETY OF THE DRIVER AND OTHER DRIVERS ON THE ROAD.  *JB",
