THEY SAID IT TAKES ABOUT A MONTH OR TWO TO RECEIVE THE PART AND IT HAS BEEN MUCH LONGER THAN THAT AND THEY STILL AREN'T ABLE TO COMPLETE THE RECALL ON MY VEHICLE. MY AIRBAG LIGHT HAS RECENTLY COME ON AND I SAW THAT THERE IS ALSO A RECALL FOR A CLOCK SPRING. I GOT MY CAR CHECKED BY A MECHANIC AND WAS TOLD I WOULD NEED A CLOCK SPRING REPLACEMENT. I NOTIFIED VOLKSWAGEN OF THIS AND WAS TOLD MY CAR WAS NOT APART OF THE RECALL BUT HOW CAN THAT BE WHEN THE EFFECTED MODELS ARE VOLKSWAGEN CC 2011-2014. THEY ARE REFUSING TO MAKE REPAIRS ON MY VEHICLE. I AM 8 MONTHS PREGNANT AND FEEL VERY UNSAFE ON MY COMMUTE TO AND FROM WORK. MY LOCAL DEALER IS UNRELIABLE AS THEY ARE NEVER ABLE TO COMPLETE REPAIRS.  WHEN THE AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON, I WAS TURNING INTO A RESTAURANT AND HEARD A CLICKING SOUND AND THE LIGHT CAME ON. MY HORN NO LONGER WORKS NOR DO THE BUTTONS ON MY STEERING WHEEL.",
