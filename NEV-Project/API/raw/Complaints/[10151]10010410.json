        "summary": "WHEN CAR IS SLOWING TO MAKE A TURN, THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS COME ON.  THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT STAYS ON. WHEN A DIAGNOSTIC TEST WAS PERFORMED, THE CODE WHICH CAME UP INDICATED A PROBLEM  DID NOT EXIST.  IT WAS DETERMINED A  SHORT CAUSED THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS AND ENGINE LIGHT TO STAY ON.  WHEN THE COMPUTER WAS RESET, THE LIGHT CAME BACK ON IN A MATTER OF MINUTES.  I DO NOT THINK THIS PROBLEM IS DUE TO AGE OF THE CAR.  MANY OF MY FRIENDS WHO HAVE THESE SAME AUTOS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.  TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM WILL REQUIRE AN EXTENSIVE SEARCH OF THE ELECTRICAL WIRING AND IS PERFORMED ON AN HOURLY RATE.  THIS COULD WELL COST HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO TRACK DOWN THE PROBLEM.  I AM UNABLE TO SELL MY VEHICLE DUE TO THE PROBLEM WITHOUT SPENDING A LARGE SUM OF MONEY TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  THIS PROBLEM BEGAN SEVERAL YEARS AGO, BUT WAS ONLY SPORADIC.  IT DID NOT OCCUR ENOUGH TO WARRANT A SEARCH.  IN THE PAST YEAR IT HAS BECOME ROUTINE.  WHAT CAN PLYMOUTH CORPORATION DO TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM WITHOUT THE EXPENSE BEING THAT OF THE OWNER.  THE MECHANIC AT THE SHOP ALSO INDICATED THAT HE WAS COMPLETELY FAMILIAR WITH THIS PROBLEM OCCURRING IN MOST VANS OF THIS AGE.  PLEASE ADVISE WHAT THE NEXT STEP SHOULD BE.  *JB",
