PREVIOUSLY I ATTEMPTED TO CRANK THE 1996 BONNEVILLE AND IT MADE A LOUD NOISE LIKE A SHOTGUN BEING FIRED.  MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND ASKED WHAT MADE THAT SOUND.  TODAY I WAS INFORMED THAT THE CAR HAD A CRACKED PLENUM,INTAKE AND IT WAS GOING TO COST OVER $600 TO REPAIR IT.  THE CAR IS AT EASLEY PONTIAC IN EASLEY, SC.  I ASKED THEM WASN'T THIS A TYPICAL PROBLEM WITH THE 3.8L V-6 ENGINE AND THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID YES.  I ASKED HIM ABOUT ANY RECALLS AND HE SAID NO.  I THEN WENT TO THE INTERNET AND CHECKED YOUR WEB PAGE AND FOUND THERE WAS A RECALL, AS REFERENCED ABOVE.  I THEN CALLED GM  PONTIAC SERVICE AND SPOKE WITH MS. TONYA BRISTLE AND INQUIRED ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC RECALL.  SHE CALLED THE DEALERSHIP WHILE I STAYED ON THE TELEPHONE.  SHE CAME BACK AND STATED THAT GM WOULD NOT COVER THIS REPAIR BECAUSE THERE WERE NO RECALLS FOR THE 1996 BONNEVILLE.  SHE ALSO SAID THEY WOULD NOT COVER IT THE REPAIRS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE MAINTENANCE RECORDS ON THE CAR AND IT WAS ALMOST 7 YEARS OLD.  I DO NOT AGREE WITH GM AND THINK THEY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIRS DUE TO THE HISTORY OF THE SAME PROBLEM WITH NEARLY ALL OF THEIR 3.8L V-6 ENGINES.  ALSO, A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO I CARRIED THE SAME CAR TO THE SAME DEALERSHIP BECAUSE THE CAR WOULD CUT OFF GOING DOWN THE INTERSTATE FOR NO APPARENT REASON.  I CALLED PONTIAC SERVICE AND ASKED THEM ABOUT THIS.  NEITHER ONE OF THEM HAD A CLUE WHY THIS WAS HAPPENING.  THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID HE WOULD REPLACE THE FUEL PUMP BUT HE WOULD NOT GUARANTEE THE CAR WOULD NOT CUT OFF AGAIN.  I WONDER IF THESE TWO INCIDENTS ARE RELATED.   *NLM",
