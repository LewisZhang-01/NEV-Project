DEALER WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROBLEM.  VEHICLE HAS BEEN SERVICED AT THIS DEALER FOR ABOUT 3 YEARS AND NO MENTION WAS EVER MADE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS PROBLEM EVEN THOUGH IT IS QUITE APPARENT THAT THIS IS A LATENT DEFECT AT LEAST UNTIL THE 1997 YEAR.  FACTORY CAMPAIGNS WERE IN PLACE THROUGH 95 AND PROBLEM WAS REDUCED ON 96 VEHICLES BUT STILL EXISTED.*JB",
