I WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PASSENGER SEAT BELT LOCKING UP BUT THOUGHT I WAS JUST DOING IT WRONG.  AFTER READING OTHER COMPLAINTS I NOTICED THAT IT IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE.  I HAVE HAD THE TRAIL BLAZER IN THE SHOP FOR THE NOISE UNDER THE FRONT WHEN YOU HIT A BUMP.  THEY CAN'T SEEM TO FIND THE CAUSE OF THE NOISE.  THE BACK GATE WOULD POP OPEN JUST DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD.  DEALER ADJUSTED THE LATCHING HOOK.  HAS NOT DONE IT SINCE.  NOW AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH I HAVE FOUND THAT THERE ARE 8 RECALLS ON THIS VEHICLE AND I HAVE JUST RECEIVED 2 NOTICES.  THIS IS A BIT UNNERVING.   *JB",
