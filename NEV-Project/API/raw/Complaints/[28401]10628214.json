THIS MORNING THE SLIP INDICATOR LIGHTS STAYED ON WITH THE GRINDING NOISE SEEMS LIKE A FEW SECONDS LONGER THAN YESTERDAY .  I WAS ABOUT TO PULL OFF OF THE ROAD WHEN THE OTHER TWO LIGHTS CAME ON AND THE CAR DROVE NORMAL WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE ON .  WHEN YOU TURN THE ENGINE OFF AND RESTART THE LIGHTS GO OFF.  HOWEVER THE ERROR OCCURS ON A DAILY BASIS NOW .  THE ROADS I TRAVEL ARE MAINLY HIGHWAY AND HAVE BEEN DRY .  I HAVE NOTICED THAT THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS FOR THE SAME ISSUE AND THAT TOYOTA DID ISSUE A RECALL FOR THE 2003 MODEL YEAR ..  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS ISSUE AND NEEDS CORRECTION .  ONE WOULD THINK THAT THE RECALL SHOULD EXTEND TO ALL YEARS .    *TR",
