I GOT UNDER THE VEHICLE TO TRY AND CHANGE THE LINE AND FOUND ALL THE LINES ARE SEVERELY RUSTED AS IS THE FUEL LINES. YES MY TRUCK IS OLD AND I LIVE IN THE RUST BELT OF N.Y BUT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE EITHER N.Y STOP USING SALT OR THE VEHICLES NEED TO BE BUILT WITH LINES THAT DON'T RUST OUT. THIS ISSUE I THINK IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT WOULD BE EASILY FIXED BY EITHER NO MORE SALT OR BETTER LINE IN THE VEHICLES THAT DON'T RUST THROUGH. *TR",
