THE HANDLE WAS IN HER HAND.  YESTERDAY THE REAR DRIVER DOOR HANDLE FELL OFF WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO OPEN THE DOOR.  THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS IN THAT WITHOUT THE HANDLE YOU CANNOT OPEN THE DOORS FROM THE OUTSIDE, AND AS SUCH EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REACH THE REAR PASSENGER IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.  WE HAVE CANALS NEXT TO THE ROAD IN SOUTH FLORIDA.  THUS I AM REPORTING THIS.  TWO DIFFERENT DOOR HANDLES IN TWO WEEKS.  VERY DANGEROUS.",
