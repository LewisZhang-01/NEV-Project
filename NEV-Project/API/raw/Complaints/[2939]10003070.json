        "summary": "OUR SON WAS DRIVING HIS 2001 FORD FOCUS ON A SMALL BACK ROAD NEAR A SHOPPING CENTER.  HE WAS DRIVING APPROMIMATELY 20 MPH THRU A SLIGHT CURVE APPROACHING A STOP SIGN.  AS HE WAS APPROACHING THE STOP SIGN, HE LIGHTLY APPLIED HIS BRAKES AND TURNED THE STEERING WHEEL TO NEGOTIATE THE SLIGHT CURVE IN THE ROAD, BUT HIS STEERING HAD FAILED - UNABLE TO NEGOTIATE THE CURVE  HIS CAR VEERED INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC LANE THEN BACK TO HIT THE CURB.  THE IMPACT ACTIVATED THE AIR BAGS, SHATTERED THE WINDSHIELD AND THE WHEEL WAS COMPLETELY BROKEN OFF.   IT APPEARS THAT THE CONTROL ARM HAD A COMPLETELY CLEAN BREAK - USUALLY NOT SEEN IN AN ACCIDENT.  THIS WAS REPORTED TO ME BY SEVERAL FORD EMPLOYEES AS A \"VERY SUSPICIOUS BREAK\" AS WELL AS THE TOW DRIVER FROM THE FORD ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE.  OUR SON ALSO REPORTED TWO DAYS PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT THAT HE FELT A \"SEVERE VIBRATION IN THE FRONT RIGHT END \" OF THE 2001 FORD FOCUS. HE PULLED OVER TO CHECK THE CAR- BUT COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING WRONG - CONTINUED AND THE VIBRATION HAD CEASED. WE ARE THANKFUL THAT THIS DID NOT HAPPEN ON THE HIGHWAY AS HE USUALLY TRAVELS ON A DAILY BASIS.",
