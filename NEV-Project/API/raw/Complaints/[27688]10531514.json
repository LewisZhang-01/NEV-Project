        "summary": "MY '02 TOYOTA CAMRY XLE HAS 115,530 MILES ON THE ODOMETER AND I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE ALL FOUR TIRES FOUR TIMES OVER THIS PERIOD (DETAILS BELOW).  AT THIS POINT, FIRESTONE BELIEVES THE PROBLEM LIES WITH THE ENGINEERING OF THE CAR SOMEHOW BECAUSE THEIR MAINTENANCE LOG SUPPORTS THE FACT THAT I HAVE GIVEN THESE TIRES THE PROPER CARE (REGULAR ALIGNMENT CHECKS, TIRE BALANCE/ROTATION EVERY 4K MILES, AND MAINTAINING PROPER AIR PRESSURE) AND THEY ARE NO LONGER WILLING TO HONOR TIRE WARRANTIES FOR THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE EACH TIME THE TIRES ARE REPLACED, THEY ARE UNDER THE WARRANTY.  THEY CLAIM THAT THE PROBABILITY OF THE PROBLEM LYING WITH THE TIRES IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE, GIVEN THIS TIRE HISTORY.  HERE ARE THE DETAILS OF DATES, ODOMETER READINGS, AND TIRE DETAILS EACH TIME THEY WERE REPLACED:     FIRST SET REPLACED 10/3/04 WITH 26,712 MILES ON ODOMETER (WITH FIRESTONE 106879 AFFINITY LH30 P215/60R16 TLBL PS).       SECOND SET REPLACED 9/1/06 WITH 49,619 MILES ON ODOMETER (WITH BRIDGESTONE 109355 TURANZA LS-T W/UNI-T AW BL P215/60R16 94T 80,000 WARRANTY).       THIRD SET REPLACED WITH 91,000 MILES ON ODOMETER (MISPLACED PAPERWORK ON DETAILS, BUT CAN PROVIDE FROM FIRESTONE DATABASE IF NEEDED).       FOURTH SET REPLACED 7/23/13 WITH 115,530 ON ODOMETER (WITH BRIDGESTONE 147127 TURANZA W.SERENITY PLUS BL 215/60R16 95V 75,000 WARRANTY).  *TR",
