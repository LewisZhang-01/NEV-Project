        "summary": "ON THE NIGHT OF MAY 13, 2003 A FEW HOURS AFTER PARKING THE CAR (1996 VOLVO 850) IN THE GARAGE THE SMELL OF GAS BECAME SO STRONG IT WAS OVERWHELMING.  INSPECTION OF THE CAR AND FLOOR OF THE GARAGE REVEALED GAS LEAKING IN A FAST STEADY DRIP FROM THE FUEL TANK.   THE LEAKED GAS HAD FORMED A SMALL PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR.   ON THE MORNING OF MAY 14, I ARRANGED TO TAKE THE CAR IN FOR SERVICE  WHERE IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THE FUEL TANK WAS INDEED LEAKING FROM THE SEAM.  THE CAR HAS NOT BEEN REPAIRED BECAUSE THE FUEL TANK WAS IS ON BACK ORDER AND IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE UNTIL JUNE 1, 2001.  THE CAR IS NOT DRIVABLE BECAUSE OF THE LEAKING FUEL.  I BELIEVE THIS LEAK IS THE RESULT OF A DEFECT IN THE ORIGINAL FUEL TANK AS THERE IS NO APPARENT DAMAGE TO THE TANK.   *NLM",
