TOOK IT THE THE MECHANIC SHOP AND THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG. DROVE IT HOME AND IT DID IT ONE TIME AGAIN. CONTINUED DRIVING IT FOR ABOUT 300 MILES BEFORE IT HAPPENED AGAIN LAST NIGHT. THIS TIME THE BRAKE FAILED AT 4 STOPS IN A ROW. THEN IT ENGAGED AGAIN AND WAS FINE THE REST OF THE 20 MILES HOME. THE DEALER MECHANIC SAID IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE ABS BUT IT WILL BE EXPENSIVE TO DIAGNOSE AND REPAIR BECAUSE IT ONLY HAPPENS INTERMITANTLY. I HAVE READ NUMEROUS OTHER COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER FUSION OWNERS FORUMS FOR THE SAME PROBLEM . ONE PERSON SAID IT COST $2000 TO FIX. FORD ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN AND SET UP A CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM BUT ONLY FOR HYBRIDS. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM. I WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE STOP SIGN AND COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IF THE OTHER PERSON HADN'T SLAMMED ON THEIR BRAKES.  *TR",
