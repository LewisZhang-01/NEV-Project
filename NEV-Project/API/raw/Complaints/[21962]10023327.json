SHORTLY AFTER USING THE SEAT FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE HARNESS TWISTS COMPLETELY AROUND MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PROPERLY SECURE MY CHILD. EVEN AFTER YOU UNTWISTED IT, IT STILL HAS A TENDENCY TO COME LOOSE. UNLESS THE HARNESS IS TIGHTENED TO THE POINT OF MAKING MY CHILD EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE, IT COMES LOOSE. COSCO SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS DESIGN FLAW. I OWN ANOTHER COSCO SEAT, PURCHASED 3 MONTHS LATER, AND THE HARNESS IS COMPLETELY REDESIGNED. I HAVE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS ONE. THEY SHOULD REPLACE THIS HARNESS JUST AS AN AUTO MANUFACTURER IS REQUIRED TO REPLACE DEFECTIVE SAFETY PARTS AS A SAFETY CAMPAIGN.   *NLM",
