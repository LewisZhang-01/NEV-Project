IN A SLOW HARD TURN ON REVERSE, THE WHEELS SEEM TO BIND UP WITH AN UNCONTROLLED LOCK INTO FOUR WHEEL DRIVE.  WITH MY RESEARCH INTO THIS PROBLEM, I DISCOVERED MANY OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. 72 PAGES OF THE SAME COMPLAINT !!  SOME EVEN TELL THE OF CAR SHIFTING INTO 4 WHEEL DRIVE ON THE HIGHWAY SLOWING THE CAR INTO DANGEROUSLY SLOW SPEED .  I TRACED COMPLAINTS BACK TO 2004 , ALL DEAL WITH THE TRANSFER CASE SHIFT MOTOR OR THE WIRING CONTROLLING IT. ALSO RELATED TO THE A/C CONNECTION, OR THE AWD, 4 HIGH AND 4 LOW LOCK SWITCH.  I EXPERIENCED THE SHIFT INTO FOUR WHEEL DRIVE IN SLOW SPEED TURNING AND BACKING BUT TO HAVE IT SHIFT INTO 4 LO LOCK DURING DRIVING HAS ME AFRAID TO DRIVE IT AT ALL.  OVER 350 COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME PROBLEM, WITH ONLY ONE WEB SITE SOUNDS LIKE A MAJOR DESIGN PROBLEM THAT DODGE HAS NOT ADDRESSED AT ALL.  FYI I BOUGHT THIS CAR USED AT KOCH 33 DEALER AND THEY DID NOT DISCLOSE THE PROBLEM IN ADVANCED.  THANKS RICH",
