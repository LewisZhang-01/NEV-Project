IMMEDIATELY, ENGINE PICKED UP AND STARTED MOVING FORWARD EVEN THOUGH BREAKS ARE COMPLETELY PRESSED. I HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO STOP THE CAR REAR ENDING. SO, I RELEASED AND RE-APPLIED BREAKS. VEHICLE REACHED COMPLETE STOP AND AGAIN STARTED ACCELERATING FORWARD. I REPEATED THE PROCESS BUT THE THIRD TIME IT HIT THE CAR INFRONT OF ME.     THE CAR IS EQUIPPED WITH :  AUTO START/STOP ENGINE (WHICH STOPS THE ENGINE WHEN THE CAR IS AT COMPLETE REST).  AUTO HOLD (WHICH ALLOWS THE DRIVER TO TAKE THE FOOT OFF OF THE BREAK)    BOTH THE FUNCTIONALITY ARE TURNED ON WHEN THE INCIDENT HAPPENED, BUT I DIDNT TAKE OFF MY FOOT FROM THE BREAK PEDAL.      ALSO, AC WAS RUNNING. I FOUND ANOTHER DRIVER COMPLAINING THE SAME ONLINE.  HTTP://WWW.BIMMERFEST.COM/FORUMS/ARCHIVE/INDEX.PHP/T-766433.HTML",
