SEVERAL MECHANICS HAVE STATED THAT THIS HAS BEEN A MOST COMMON OCCURRENCE AMONG THE CHRSYLER/DODGE MINI-VANS OF 1996.  CHRYSLER WILL NOT EXTEND GOOD WILL OR ASSISTANCE EVEN THOUGH THE FAULT LIES WITH THEM IN ITS POOR DESIGN THAT WAS SOON AFTER REVAMPED.  WHAT IS REALLY DISTRESSING IS THAT CHRYSLER RAISED THE COST OF THE STRUT MOUNTS RECENTLY, WHICH ARE DEALER PARTS ONLY, BY ABOUT 84% AS THEY REALIZE MORE AND MORE CONSUMERS NEED TO MAKE THIS EXPENSIVE REPAIR.  *AK",
