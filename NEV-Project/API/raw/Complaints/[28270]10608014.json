        "summary": "I IN OCTOBER OF 2013 I PURCHASED A CHRYSLER 300 NEW FROM CENTRAL CHRYSLER IN RAYNHAM MA. IT HAS A 36000 MILE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY AS WELL AS A 15000 MILE NO HASSLE WARRANTY. MY TRANSMISSION BEGAN TO SHIFT HARSHLY (AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION) IN FEBRUARY OF 2014, AND I RECEIVED SERVICE IN APRIL OF 2014. I WAS TOLD THE TRANSMISSION REQUIRED A PART THAT WAS NOT YET MANUFACTURED BY CHRYSLER, BUT THAT I WOULD HAVE THE PART IN LATE MAY OR EARLY JUNE. NOT ONLY HAVE I NOT RECEIVED THE PART, I WAS TOLD BY CHRYSLER CORPORATE THAT THE PART IS NOT EVEN IN DEVELOPMENT. THE DEALER WILL DO NOTHING EXCEPT REVALUE THE CAR AT A SIGNIFICANT LOSS TO ME FINANCIALLY AND THAT IS PREDATORY AND INAPPROPRIATE. I HAVE INVOLVED THE ATTORNEY GENERALS OFFICE TO INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE AS WELL AS THE CHRYSLER CORPORATION. THE DEALERSHIP REFUSES TO REVISIT THE TRANSMISSION ISSUE CURRENTLY. I AM DRIVING AND PAYING FOR A CAR THAT IS \"OPERATING AS DESIGNED\" WHICH IS A DESIGN FLAW WITH NO FIX OFFERED, IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE WARRANTY. I HAVE BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO 2 ADDITIONAL DEALERSHIPS WITH NO FIXES OR REPAIRS POSSIBLE AS OF YET. THIS IS A BADLY DESIGNED CAR WITH EXTREMELY POOR SERVICE FROM BOTH CORPORATE AND DEALERSHIP LEVELS.   *TR",
