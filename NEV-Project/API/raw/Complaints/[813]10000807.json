ALSO, THE NUMBER OF FAILURES SECTION...ONCE FAILURE OCCURRED, IT CONTINUED)  WENT TO MECHANIC TO FIND PROBLEM.  THERE WAS ANOTHER 1996 VAN THERE WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM (QUITE COINCIDENTAL, WHICH PROMPTED THIS COMPLAINT).  MECHANIC SAID THE HEIGHT SENSOR VALVE NEEDED REPLACEMENT, COULD ONLY BE DONE BY DEALER DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS A DEALER PART ONLY AND THAT THE GAS TANK NEEDED REMOVAL.  THE REASON I AM PROCEEDING WITH THIS COMPLAINT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT I HAD LITTLE TO NO WARNING THAT BRAKE FAILURE WAS IMMINENT.  DURING ONE TRIP (APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES TOTAL), BRAKES BEGAN TO FEEL \"SPONGY\", THEN BRAKE LIGHT CAME ON, THEN TOTAL BRAKE FAILURE.  FORTUNATELY, WE WERE ON NEIGHBORHOOD ROADS WITHOUT OUR THREE CHILDREN IN THE VEHICLE.  VAN WAS INSPECTED IN SEPTEMBER, NO INDICATION PROBLEM EXISTED.  *JB",
