        "summary": "MY 2009 CAMRY DASHBOARD IS MELTING. THE LEATHER CONSOLE BETWEEN SEATS HAS CRACKED.THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM KEEPS SHORTING OUT. ALL CIGARETTE LIGHTERS/CHARGER LOCATIONS HAVE SHORTED OUT INCLUDING THE AUX. A WEEK AFTER BUYING MY CAR THE SAFETY FEATURE TO LOCK PLACE MAT IN PLACE BROKE. NEARLY CAUSING A CAR WRECK AS THE PLACE MAT LODGED IN BETWEEN THE GAS AND BRAKE. THE RADIO, LOCATION WHERE SPEEDOMETER, CLOCK, AND SERVICE LIGHTS LOCATIONS ARE FOGGED UP AND GETTING WORSE DAILY. WHEN I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT THE DASHBOARD I WAS TOLD,\"IT WAS MY FAULT. PROBABLY CAUSED BY A CLEANING PRODUCT.\"  WHICH I KNEW WAS ENTIRELY NOT TRUE. CIGARETTE LIGHTER COVERS HAVE DRY ROT AND BROKEN, PLASTIC/LEATHER HAS DRY ROT UNDER ALL 4 WINDOWS LEAVING SCRATCH LOOKING MARKS, DRY ROT PAINT BY STICK SHIFT IS PEELING. HEADLIGHTS FOG UP EASILY WITH WATER IN THEM. I WAS IN A CAR WRECK A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.WHEN I WAS GOING ABOUT 10 MPH AND A VEHICLE RAN THE RED LIGHT HITTING THE RIGHT SIDE OF VEHICLES FRONT AREA. THEY WERE GOING AT LEAST 45 MPH. NO AIRBAG DEPLOYED. UNDERNEATH FRONT OF CAR IS A PLASTIC PIECE THAT KEEPS FALLING DOWN. SOME DAYS I AM UNABLE TO TAKE CAR OUT OF PARK UNLESS I TURN THE WHEEL,\"HARD\". I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANYTHING VIA MAIL ABOUT ANY RECALLS ON MY VEHICLE. I STILL LIVE AT THE SAME ADDRESS! TOOK CAR TO DEALER AGAIN ABOUT FRONT PASSENGER WINDOW AND DRIVER SIDE WINDOW NOT BEING ABLE TO ROLL DOWN OR UP WINDOWS. I HAD TO PAY QUITE A BIT OF MONEY TO HAVE FIXED. PASSENGER WINDOW SWITCH IS BROKEN AND STILL IS  JUST LIKE DRIVERS SIDE WAS. WAS TOLD\" IT WAS MOST LIKELY BECAUSE SOMEONE TRIED TO BREAK INTO MY CAR.\" WHICH I KNEW WAS NOT THE CASE. I AM VERY DISGUSTED AND CONSIDERING FILING A LAWSUIT AGAINST TOYOTA. I BOUGHT A LEMON CAR! I KEEP MY OIL CHANGES UP TO DATE, FLUIDS, FILTERS, ETC.I HAVE NEVER FELT SO DISAPPOINTED IN A VEHICLE PURCHASE IN MY LIFE. I'D LIKE A FULL REFUND.  *TR",
