OCCURRED AT LOW SPEED SO IT WAS NOT DANGEROUS AS IF IT HAPPENED AT SPEED.  THAT WAS THE FIRST FAILURE.  RECENTLY I FOUND IT WAS CRACKED DURING SERVICE OF THE WATER PUMP.  INSTALLED THE 3RD ADJUSTER AT THAT POINT.  RECENTLY I FOUND AFTERMARKET PARTS TO PREVENT FUTURE FAILURES AS THIS IS ACTUALLY A VERY COMMON PROBLEM ON THESE MOTORCYCLES AS THE GET HIGH IN MILES.      AT THIS POINT I HAVE HAD 2 FAILURES OF A PART THAT IS A VERY WELL KNOWN ABOUT.  JUST LOOK AT \"KNOWN ISSUES\" HERE HTTP://WWW.BIGCEE.COM/KLR650FAQ.HTML#INTAKE. *JB",
