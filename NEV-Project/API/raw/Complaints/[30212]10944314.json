I HAVE CALLED DODGE HEADQUARTERS AND TIME AND AGAIN BEEN REFERRED TO MY LOCAL DEALER. THE DEALER SAYS THEY WILL CALL ME WHEN THEY GET THE PARTS. I HAVE NEVER HEARD FROM THE DEALER ON THIS SUBJECT. I BELIEVE THIS STARTED BACK IN 2014/2015 BUT IT'S HARD TO TELL SINCE NONE OF THE NOTICES ARE DATED. WHEN CAN I EXPECT TO GET THIS POSSIBLY EXPLOSIVE PART REPLACED?",
