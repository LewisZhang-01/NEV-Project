TO OPEN THE DOOR, YOU MUST KNOW TO BE HOLDING ON THE HANDLE AND PULL IT IN THE SPLIT SECOND AFTER YOU ACTIVATE THE UN-LOCK BUTTON. THIS COULD BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IN A SITUATION WHERE THE PASSENGER HAD TO GET OUT OF THE CAR IMMEDIATELY AS IN CASE OF A FIRE, SUBMERGING IN WATER OR AFTER A WRECK. I AM FRIGHTENED TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN ONE OF THESE CASES AND A CHILD OR UNSUSPECTING ADULT WERE IN THE VEHICLE AND COULD NOT GET OUT. OF COURSE, THERE ARE MANY OTHER SCENARIOS WHERE THE PASSENGER WOULD HAVE TO GET OUT IN A HURRY AND THIS DEFECTIVE LOCKING MECHANISM WOULD PREVENT THEIR ESCAPE.  *TR",
