I ACCIDENTALLY TOUCHED THE RED BUTTON ON THE LOWER SEAT BELT STRAP, AND THE SEAT BELT RELEASED. THIS I FEEL IS A DEFECT THAT CHRYSLER SHOULD FIX. WHY WOULD THEY HAVE THIS BUTTON SO HIGH, THAT A SIMPLE TOUCH RELEASES THE SEAT BELT. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS HAS RESULTED IN ANYONE GETTING HURT, BUT I CAN SEE THE POTENTIAL. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A ROLL OVER, WHERE THE OCCUPANT WAS REACHING TO GRAB ON ANYTHING TO STABLE THEMSELVES, AND THEY TOUCHED THE RED BUTTON.  *JB",
