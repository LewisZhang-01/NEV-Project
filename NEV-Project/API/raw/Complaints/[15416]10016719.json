THE BATTERY BLEW UP, BUT WAS REPLACED AS WAS THE AC TURNING OFF AND ON BY ITSELF.  THE ONE ISSUE THAT IS VERY CONCERNING TO ME, IS ONE FAMILIAR TO YOU.  MY CAR CUTS OFF AT ANYTIME WHILE DRIVING.  IT HAS DONE THIS TO ME ON 2 SEPARATE OCCASIONS.  NASHVILLE HAS 3 INTERSTATES RUNNING THROUGH IT AND I WAS ON THEM BOTH TIMES THIS HAPPENED.  IT WAS VERY SCARY AND DANGEROUS. IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THE SHOPS THAT I HAVE TAKEN IT TO CANNOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  THE MECHANICS AT THEN SHOPS TOLD ME THAT MALIBU'S ARE BY FAR SOME OF THE MOST TROUBLESOME CARS ON THE ROAD TODAY.  SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE KILLED.  YOU LOSE CONTROL AND HAVE NO STEERING ABILITY, WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  I CAN SEE FROM OTHERS THAT THEIR PROBLEMS ARE BEING IGNORED AS WELL.  WHEN WILL GM ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM.  DON'T THEY WATCH THE NEWS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE FIRESTONE RECALL, OR THE TOBACCO COMPANIES THAT KEPT SECRETS?  IT IS TIME FOR SOMEONE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR PRODUCT.   *NLM",
