THERE WAS A RECALL AT ONE TIME ON THIS PROBLEM BUT WAS CHECKED BY A FORD DEALER AND NOTHING WAS FOUND TO BE WRONG.  APPROXIMATELY 6 MONTHS LATER IT HAD TO BE REPLACED.  BECAUSE THE RECALL HAD EXPIRED  FORD WOULD NOT REPLACE IT FOR FREE AND SO I HAD TO HAVE IT REPLACED AT MY COST OF $600.00.  2.  AIR BAGS AND SEAT BELT RESTRAINTS.  MY WIFE HAD A WRECK IN THE SAME VEHICLE AND THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY OR DID THE SEAT BELTS LOCK UP LIKE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO.  I TRIED TO GET FORD TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THAT WOULD HAPPEN AND THEY SAID THE INSURANCE COMPANY WOULD HAVE TO HANDLE IT.  THE PROBLEM WAS STILL NOT SOLVED.  ALSO THE ABS DID NOT WORK.   *NLM",
