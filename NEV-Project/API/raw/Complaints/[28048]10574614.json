I STARTED WATCHING THE OIL CONSUMPTION, WHICH HAS GOTTEN WORSE. I NOW ADD ABOUT 1.5 QUARTS EVERY 1000 MILES. IT EMITS NO BLUE SMOKE FROM THE EXHAUST AND HAS NO OIL LEAKS. IT'S GETTING WORSE. AFTER OWNING A VERY RELIABLE 2005 CIVIC, THIS CAR HAS BEEN A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT. MY HONDA DEALER WON'T EVEN RETURN MY CALL (I'VE CALLED THEM 18 TIMES) AND WHEN I GO IN PERSON, THEY TELL ME THEY WILL HAVE TO CONSULT WITH THE MANUFACTURER'S SPECIALIST, WHO ONLY STOPS IN THE DEALERSHIP EVERY 2 WEEKS. I'VE GOING IN PERSON TO ASK ABOUT THIS 4 TIMES. HONDA HAS OFFERED A HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE THUS FAR.  *TR",
