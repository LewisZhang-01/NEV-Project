THE CAR WASN'T UNDER WARRENTY AND THE COST FOR REPAIRS RAN UP TO 1300.00 WHICH IS OUTRAGIOUS.  I FEEL THAT IF FORD HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS DEFECT THAT FORD SHOULD HAVE RECALLED THIS DEFECT LONG BEFORE SO MANY HAVE NEEDED REPAIRS.  I REGRET THAT THIS IS THE LAST FORD I WILL EVER OWN, WHICH IS DIRECTLY DUE TO THE INEPT CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT FORD IS NOW KNOWN FOR.",
