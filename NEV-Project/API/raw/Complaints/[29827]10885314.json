WHEN I HAD TWO MECHANICS LOOK AT IT AND THEY STATED THAT MY BATTERY IS BEING DRAINED DUE TO MY SEAT FUNCTION NOT WORKING PROPERLY. AFTER NOT USING MY BATTERY FOR HOURS IT DIES. I KEEP HAVING TO JUMP IT. MY BATTERY HAS BEEN REPLACED LESS THAN A MONTH AGO SO I KNOW THE BATTERY IS NOT AN ISSUE. MY DISPLAY SCREEN GIVES ME A FEW DIFFERENT MALFUNCTIONS AND THAN ONE MOMENT IT DISPLAYS NO MALFUNCTIONS. AFTER CHARGING MY CAR AND THAN LEAVING IT A STRANGE CHURPING SOUND GOES OFF IN MY CAR CAUSING MY BATTERY TO DIE AGAIN. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN MY CAR HAS DIED IN AT NIGHT IN STRANGE AREAS AND I HAVE TO ALONE AND UNSAFELY JUMP MY CAR AND SIT UNTIL MY JUMPER PROVIDES MY BATTERY WITH ENOUGH JUICE TO START MY CAR. WHEN I AM DRIVING MY FUNCTIONS STOP WORKING BECAUSE MY BATTERY ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH TO POWER THE EVERYTHING. THIS HAS HAPPENED ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS.",
