        "summary": "THE REAR WINDOW OF MY 2002 CHEVROLET TRAILBLAZER POPS OPEN WHILE DRIVING, EVEN WHEN IT IS LOCKED.  ITS BEEN INTO THE DEALER (3 DIFFERENT ONES)  7 TIMES AND CHEVROLET HAS TOLD ME THAT SINCE THEY CAN'T REPLICATE THE PROBLEM, THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.  THE WINDOW POPS OPEN SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK.  WE DO DRIVE ON A DIRT ROAD, BUT ITS NOTHING UNUSUALLY ROUGH.  MY WIFE HAS STARTED HAVING MIGRAINE HEADACHES, AND THEY STARTED A FEW WEEKS AFTER WE BOUGHT THIS CAR.  WE HAVE THE OPINION OF SEVERAL DOCTORS THAT SAY THESE HEADACHES COULD BE CAUSED BY THE EXHAUST THAT FILLS THE CAR WHEN THE WINDOW POPS OPEN.  I'VE ASKED THE DEALER IF THEY COULD MAKE THE WINDOW SO IT DOESN'T OPEN AT ALL, BUT SINCE ITS A LEASE, THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING TO THE CAR THAT WOULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE CAR.  I ALSO BELIEVE THIS TO BE A PROBLEM BECAUSE OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN WHEN I'M DRIVING DOWN THE INTERSTATE AND THE WINDOW POPS OPEN (WHICH HAPPENS VERY OFTEN) AND SOMETHING FLIES OUT THE WINDOW AND CAUSES ANOTHER CAR TO WRECK AND POSSIBLY KILLS SOMEONE.  ANOTHER PROBLEM I HAVE IS THAT SOMETIMES THE WINDOW UNLATCHES, AND WE DON'T REALIZE IT.  IF I PARK MY VEHICLE SOMEWHERE AND SOMEONE STEALS THE CONTENTS OF THE CAR, OR THE CAR ITSELF.  AFTER DISCUSSING THESE ISSUES WITH THE CHEVROLET CUSTOMER SERVICE REP (DAN) THEY SAID THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF THESE CASES.  THIS FAILURE HAPPENS ABOUT EVERY THREE DAYS AND STARTED ABOUT A WEEK AFTER WE BOUGHT IT (AROUND 7/5/2002).  WE'VE HAD 3 OTHER NEW LEASED VEHICLES (1998 DODGE RAM, 2000 PONTIAC GRAND AM, AND A 2001 DODGE RAM) SINCE MOVING INTO OUR CURRENT HOUSE AND HAVE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE ROADS WE DRIVE ON, OR HOW WE DRIVE THEM.  I FEAR FOR MY SAFETY AS WELL AS THE SAFETY OF OTHERS WHILE DRIVING THIS CAR, HOWEVER I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE SINCE I CAN'T AFFORD TO TERMINATE THE LEASE AND BUY ANOTHER CAR.....PLEASE HELP.  *NLM",
