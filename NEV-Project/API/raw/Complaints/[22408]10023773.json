I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE DEALER ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS AND THEY STATED THIS IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY THEREFORE IF THEY LOOK IT WILL COST ME. THE DEALER STATED I DROVE WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, WHICH CAUSED THE BRAKE TO GO OUT, WHICH IS UNTRUE. I WENT TO A PERSONAL MECHANIC WHO STATED THAT THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED AND IT SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY. AFTER SPEAKING WITH OTHER GMC / CHEVROLET OWNERS THEY ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUES WITH THE E BRAKE GOING OUT, ALL HAVE HAD THE SAME RESPONSE FROM THE DEALERS..     *NLM",
