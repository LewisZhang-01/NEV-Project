        "summary": "I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF A 2007 SATURN AURA XR THAT WAS PURCHASED IN AUGUST 2007.  ALMOST IMMEDIATELY I HAD TO BRING THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER IN SEPT 2007 TO INVESTIGATE \"SERVICE AIR BAG\" AND \"ESC\" WARNING LIGHTS.  ADDITIONALLY, I BEGAN NOTICING THAT MY BRAKE LIGHTS WERE MALFUNCTIONING.  THEY WOULD BE ON WHILE I WAS DRIVING AND THEN WOULD GO OFF WHEN THE PEDAL WAS DEPRESSED.  THIS MADE FOR VERY UNSETTLING DRIVING.  I HAD TO BRING THE CAR BACK TO SATURN TWICE IN 2007 TO \"FIX\" THE PROBLEM BUT I HAS STARTED AGAIN.  I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE CHEVY DEALER THAT NOW PROVIDES SERVICE FOR SATURN CUSTOMERS ON JUNE 22, 2010 TO ADDRESS THE BRAKE LIGHTS.  THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR TWO DAYS AND SUPPOSEDLY \"FIXED\" IT.  WELL THE PROBLEM STILL PERSISTS.  YOU CAN REMOTE START THE CAR AND THE BRAKE LIGHTS ARE ON.  YOU CAN TURN THE CAR ON NORMALLY,, DEPRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL AND THE BRAKE LIGHTS ILLUMINATE BUT FAIL TO GO OFF.  THE CENTER BRAKE LIGHT DOESN'T APPEAR TO WANT TO WORK CORRECTLY EITHER.  THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING.  DOES ANYONE KNOW THE CORRECT SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM?  PS-MY MILEAGE IS 18,000 MILES. *TR",
