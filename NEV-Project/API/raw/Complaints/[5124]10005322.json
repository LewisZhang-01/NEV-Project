I HAVE HAD THE DEALER REPLACE THE HEADLINER BECAUSE THEY \"CLAIMED\" IT WAS THE WRONG ONE FOR THE TRUCK. SINCE IT WAS REPLACED AND PLUGS REPLACED NUMEROUS TIMES, THEY DECIDED THAT IT WASN'T CRITICAL ENOUGH TO WARRANT NEW DESIGN OR REPAIR. MY HEADLINER HAS DROPPED DOWN AND REMAINS SO TODAY. THEIR FIX IS TO WRAP FELT AROUND THE PLUGS AND \"RAM THEM BACK IN\" AS THE SERVICE WRITER EXPLAINED TO ME. THIS IS UNEXCEPTABLE TO ME AND I HAVE TRIED TO GET THEM TO FIX IT ANOTHER WAY TO NO AVAIL.",
