IT APPEARS THAT THE FRONT RIGHT FENDER PANEL HAS SLID BACK TOWARDS THE DOOR APPROX. 1/2 INCH AND THAT IS WHAT'S BLOCKING THE DOOR. UPON FURTHER INSPECTION THE HINGE IS SLIGHTLY BENT. DEALER IS TRYING TO SAY THAT THE DOOR WAS SPRUNG. WITNESSES THAT I HAVE INCLUDING 2 POLICE OFFICERS CAN STATE THAT THIS DID NOT HAPPEN. THEY CAN STATE THAT THE DOOR OPENED FINE THE FIRST 2 TIMES AND THEN NOT AT ALL LATER. BODY SHOP MECHANIC SLID SOMETHING INSIDE THE DOOR HINGE AND POPPED IT OPEN RESULTING IN THE PAINT ON THE HINGE TO BE SCRAPED OFF. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A WARRANTY ISSUE BUT THE DEALER REFUSES TO FIX IT WITHOUT PAYMENT. I FEEL SINCE THIS DID NOT HAPPEN BY CAUSE OR FAULT OF ME NOR WAS THIS VEHICLE HIT ON THE DRIVER SIDE, THAT IT IS A DEFECT AND NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED. *TS   *JB  ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12-12-02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS***762999",
