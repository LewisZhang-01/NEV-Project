I THEN HAD BOTH REAR CALIPERS REPLACED ALONG WITH PADS AND ROTORS.  ONLY 3 MONTHS LATER THE RIGHT REAR BRAKE BEGAN GRINDING AGAIN.  THE RIGHT REAR CALIPER WAS AGAIN REPLACED ALONG WITH ROTORS AND PADS.  MY MECHANIC REPORTED THAT A PROPORTIONING VALVE HAD A GREAT DEAL OF RUST AND WAS NOT PERMITTING BRAKE FLUID TO THE RIGHT REAR BRAKE.  THIS VALVE HAS LINES TO ALL 4 BRAKES AND HE IS UNCERTAIN IF ALL LINES MUST BE REPLACED WHEN THE VALVE IS REPLACED.",
