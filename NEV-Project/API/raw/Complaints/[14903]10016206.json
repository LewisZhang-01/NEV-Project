        "summary": "I HAVE A 2000 FORD FOCUS ZTS AUTOMOBILE WITH APPROXIMATELY 10000 MILES.  I JUST HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE ELECTRIC LOCK SYSTEM.  THE ELECTRIC LOCK DOOR ACTUATOR IN THE RIGHT REAR DOOR FAILED.  THE ENTIRE LOCKING SYSTEM STOPPED WORKING AND THE RIGHT FORWARD AND LEFT REAR DOORS BOTH LOCKED CLOSED.  THE DOORS WERE NOT ABLE TO BE OPENED MANUALLY FROM THE INSIDE OR OUTSIDE.  THIS BOTHERS ME BECAUSE I FEEL A POSSIBLE ENTRAPMENT SITUATION COULD RESULT IF THIS OCCURS AS A RESULT OF A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT OR WATER SUBMERGED.  MY FAILURE OCCURRED AS I WAS LOADING THE CAR FOR MY TRIP HOME FROM WORK.  I MAY HAVE HAD THE RIGHT REAR AND LEFT FRONT DOORS OPEN AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE, WHICH MAY EXPLAIN WHY THEY WERE NOT AFFECTED.  NORMALLY, THE DOORS WILL OPEN FROM THE INSIDE EVEN IF LOCKED.  THIS FAILURE OVERRIDES THAT SAFETY FEATURE.    *JB",
