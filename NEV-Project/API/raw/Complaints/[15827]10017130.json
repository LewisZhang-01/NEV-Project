A FEW MINUTES LATER THE CAR WAS IN AN INFERNO. I SPOKE TO FORD AND THEY INITIALLY DENIED ANY RECALLS ON THE VEHICLE BUT I FOUND A COUPLE ON MY OWN THROUGH YOUR WEB SITE. ONCE THAT WAS MADE KNOWN TO FORD THEY SIMPLY STATED THAT I WAS SENT LETTERS TO HAVE THE REPAIRS MADE SO THEY HAVE NO LIABILITY. THIS IS WRONG I'M SURE. MY WIFE AND TWO SMALL CHILDREN COULD HAVE BURNED TO DEATH! WHAT RECOURSE DO I HAVE IN THIS CASE?   *NLM",
