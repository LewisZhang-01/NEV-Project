ALSO, ONE DEALER SAID THAT MY MOTOR MOUNTS WERE BROKEN, AND A DIFFERENT DEALER SAID NOTHING ABOUT THE MOTOR MOUNTS.  I TAKE THE CAR IN FOR IT'S INSPECTIONS, AND HAVE NOT BEEN IN ANY KIND OF AN ACCIDENT.  BECAUSE MY WARRENTY IS EXPIRED, I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF IT ALL OUT OF POCKET.  THIS IS THE WORST CAR I HAVE EVER BOUGHT!",
