I HAD TAKEN MY VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP 5 TIMES BEFORE THEY CORRECTLY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A FUEL TANK VAPOR LEAK.  THE ONLY WAY TO FIX THIS IS TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE FUEL TANK.  MY VEHICLE HAS BEEN IN THE THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT FOR THE PAST 3 WEEKS AND THE FUEL TANK IS ON NATIONAL BACKORDER.  I HAVE BEEN READING ABOUT THIS BEING A PROBLEM ON THE TRAILBLAZER EXT. ON MANY WEBSITES AND BLOGS.  IT SEEMS THAT THIS WOULD BE OF A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN.  *TR",
