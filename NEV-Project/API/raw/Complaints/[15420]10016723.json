I HAVE FOUND THAT IF THEY ARE NOT WORKING THAT I CAN GET THEM WORKING AGAIN BY ACTIVATING THE 4-WAY FLASHERS.  SOMETIMES IT TAKES PRESSING THE 4-WAY FLASHER BUTTON NUMEROUS TIMES TO GET THE 4-WAY FLASHERS WORKING BUT THEN THE TURN SIGNALS WILL WORK AGAIN.  I BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM IS IN THE FLASHER UNIT.  THIS SEEMS TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY ISSUE.   *NLM",
