        "summary": "THERE ARE TWO PROBLEMS WHICH ARE OCCURRING ALL THE TIME:  1.  THE VAN SMELLS OF GAS EVERY ONCE IN WHILE.  THERE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF RECALLS REGARDING THIS MATTER AND THEY HAVE BEEN PERFORMED ON THE VAN.  STILL THE FUEL SMELL IS THERE.  HAVE WRITTEN TO CHRYSLER, THEY ONLY HAVE ONE ANSWER FOR THIS: YOU HAVE EXCEEDED THE MILEAGE REQUIREMENT FOR WARRANTY.  I THINK THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND CHRYSLER SHOULD TAKE CARE OF IT.  WHY DO THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOMEBODY TO GET HURT BEFORE THEY WILL PAY UP?  PLEASE HELP.  2.  WINDSHIELD WIPERS:  THESE HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE I BOUGHT THE VAN.  THEY COME ON INTERMITTENTLY.  SOMETIMES THEY COME ON WHEN I AM USING TURN SIGNAL, TURNING ON RADIO, OR JUST DRIVING.  THEN THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE VARIOUS SPEEDS STOP WORKING, AND THE WIPERS ONLY WORK AT HIGH SPEEDS.  WARRANTY WORK WAS PERFORMED A FEW TIMES DURING WARRANTY PERIOD.  SINCE THEN, LAST FALL THE WIPERS STOPPED WORKING COMPLETELY.  TOOK IT TO THE DEALER, THEY CHANGED THE BODY MODULE UNIT AND IT COST ME $650 TO FIX IT.  IT WORKED FINE FOR A MONTH BUT SINCE THEN THE WIPERS ARE DOING THE SAME THINGS AS MENTIONED EARLIER, EXCEPT THEY HAVEN'T DIED YET.  ONCE AGAIN CHRYSLER GIVES ME A STANDARD RESPONSE.  THEY KNOW WIPERS ARE A PROBLEM, AND THEY WON'T FIX THEM.*JB",
