WHEN I TRIED TO REPLACE THE BULB, I SOON LEARNED THAT THE BRAKE LIGHT IS LED AND A SEALED UNIT, MAKING IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO REPAIR. THE REPLACEMENT UNIT IS ASTRONOMICALLY EXPENSIVE, PRICES BETWEEN $150-$350 USED.  IF THE UNIT HAD A REPLACEABLE BULB, THEN I WOULDN'T EVEN BE WRITING THIS. I UNDERSTAND THAT NOTHING WILL MOST LIKELY BE DONE ABOUT THIS, BUT IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.   *TR",
