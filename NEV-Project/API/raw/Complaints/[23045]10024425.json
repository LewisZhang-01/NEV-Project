TIRE #1 12,000 MILES, #2 13,000 MILES, #3 14,500 MILES. I WENT FOR VALVE STEM RECALL ABOUT 14-17 MONTHS PRIOR TO ALL TIRE FAILURES AT SAYVILLE FORD.    I HAVE ALL DOCUMENTATION, BILLS FOR ROAD SERVICE REPAIRS, ETC. THEY TOLD ME THE \"ZIPPER FAILURE\" ON THE SIDEWALL IS DUE TO \"UNINFLATED TIRES NOT THE FAULTY VALVE STEMS THAT FAILED\".    THE LAST BLOWOUT IS STILL ON THE RIM WHICH I WILL CHANGE SOON BEING IT IS THE SPARE TIRE. ONE TIRE WAS THROWN OUT (DISCARDED) BY ERROR.     I WOULD LIKE TO BE REIMBURSED FOR THE THREE TIRES THAT I KEPT FOR EVIDENCE, NEW VALVE STEMS (DIFFERENT TYPE) AND ROAD SERVICE. *TS",
