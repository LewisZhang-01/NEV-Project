'  THIS CODE CAME UP OVER A YEAR AGO AND THE DEALER CLEARED THE CODE. NOW IT'S BACK AFTER BEING ON AND OFF FOR OVER 6MONTHS. THIS TIME IT'S CONSTANT AND THE DEALER TODAY SAID THAT THE SENSOR PAD UNDER THE SEAT / SENSOR HAS TO BE REPLACED. THE COAST IS $1400. THIS IS NOT RIGHT AND FAIR. IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT MY PASSENGER WILL NOT BE PROTECTED. 1000S ONLINE COMPLAIN OF THE SAME ISSUE AND BMW ISN'T DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT.",
