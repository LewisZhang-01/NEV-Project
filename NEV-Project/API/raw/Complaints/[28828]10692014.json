I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO LEAVE THE VEHICLE BECAUSE IT WAS NEEDED AND MADE OUR WAY AROUND THE ISSUE. I WOULD LIKE TO SELL THE VAN BUT NOW I AM TOLD IT WILL BE ALMOST 2000 TO FIX BECAUSE IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY?? MAKES NO SENSE AS WHEN I INITIALLY CALLED, THEY STATED IT WOULD BE NO CHARGE AND NEVER MENTIONED ANYTHING ABOUT TIME OR MILEAGE. I BEG TO DIFFER ON THIS ISSUE AS WHEN I MADE THE INITIAL CALL IT WAS COVERED. SO SHOULDN'T IT STILL BE?   *TR",
