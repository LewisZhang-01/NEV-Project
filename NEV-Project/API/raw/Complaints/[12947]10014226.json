THE NEW PLENUM CHAMBER NOW CONTAINS A NYLON DOOR IN STEAD OF PLASTIC. THIS LOOKS LIKE FORD KNOWS THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE OLD STYLE DOORS BUT WILL NOT GIVE ANY ASSISTANCE ON REPAIRS. THE COST OF REPAIR IS STEEP! I WAS QUOTED $108.00 FOR THE PLENUM CHAMBER AND $598.00 TO INSTALL IT. FROM WHAT I HAVE LEARNED THE PROBLEM IS NOT ISOLATED TO ME, IN FACT THE DEALER I PHONED HAD JUST SOLD A REPLACEMENT PLENUM THE PREVIOUS DAY AND WAS WAITING FOR ONE TO ARRIVE TO FILL THERE STOCK. WHEN A DEALER STOCKS A PART THERE USUALLY IS A LARGE DEMAND FOR IT!    *NLM",
