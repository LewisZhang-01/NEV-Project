(847) 991 9000 BECAUSE THE CAR WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY UNTIL MAY 31, 2005. THEY HAVE HAD IT ALL NOW THEY TELL ME THEY WILL NOT COVER IT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY SAID SOMETHING BROKE IN THE ENGINE THAT'S WHY IT STOPPED RUNNING. I THINK THEY SHOULD FIX IT BUT THEY KEEP SAYING THEY WILL NOT. WHY DO THEY PUT A WARRANTY ON A CAR IF THEY ARE NOT GOING TO STAND BEHIND IT. I NEED YOU HELP TO GET IT FIXED. THANK YOU.   *PH    *NLM    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**768325",
