        "summary": "ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS MY 2001 CHEVROLET BLAZER HAS NEARLY CAUSED ME TO HAVE A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT.  TWICE WHILE JUST DRIVING ALONG AT A NORMAL RATE, THE MOTOR SPED UP TO PROBABLY 70 OR 80 MPH CREATING A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION.  IT WAS VERY LUCKY THAT THERE WAS NOTHING IN FRONT OF ME.  THIS HAS BEEN  AN ONGOING DEFECT WITH THIS VEHICLE.    THE SERVICE MANAGER STATES THAT THIS A VERY DANGEROUS DEFECT IN MY CAR.  I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE IT AS EACH TIME THEY SAY IT IS REPAIRED, IT HAS HAPPENED ONCE AGAIN.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION WHICH COULD EASILY LEAD TO A DREADFUL ACCIDENT AND LOSS OF LIFE.  IT IS MY OPINION THAT GENERAL MOTORS SHOULD OFFER ME A NEW VEHICLE IN PLACE OF THE VERY DANGEROUS ONE I NOW OWN.  I COULD NOT,  IN GOOD FAITH, CONSIDER SELLING IT KNOWING HOW DANGEROUS IT IS.  FORTUNATELY THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN ACCIDENT WITH IT, BUT I FEEL THAT IT COULD EASILY HAPPEN.  ON ALL THREE OCCASIONS, MY DEALER, BUZZ CHEW, SOUTHAMPTON, NY HAS BEEN APPRISED OF THIS DEFECT AND ATTEMPTED TO FIX IT, BUT IT IS ONLY A TEMPORARY FIX.  IT IS ALSO A KNOW FACT THAT OTHER VEHICLES OF THE SAME MAKE HAVE HAD THE SAME ONGOING DEFECT.  *JB",
