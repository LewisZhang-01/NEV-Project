        "summary": "I STARTED TO FEEL A LITTLE SLIP IN THE TRANSMISSION WHEN TAKING OFF FROM A STOP SIGN OR BACKING OUT OF MY DRIVE WAY. I CALLED AND SET UP AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE HONDA DEALER. THEY COULD NOT GET ME IN FOR THREE DAYS SO I TOOK IT TO MIDAS IT. THE MAN TOLD ME I HAD SOME VERY BAD TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS AND COULD NOT TOUCH IT. HE SAID IT WAS LEAKING FLUID OUT THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TRANSMISSION AND ALL HE COULD DO WOULD BE TO FILL IT UP WITH THE SPECIAL FLUID THAT HONDA USES. SO $80.00 BUCKS LATER I GOT SOME FLUID IN IT AND THEN CALLED THE LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP TO ASK WHY MY 2000 ACCORD THAT I PAID $25,000.00 HAD A BAD TRANSMISSION AFTER ONLY 72,000 MILES. I WAS TOLD THAT ,WELL THERE HAS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH THE 2000 ACCORD AUTO TRANSMISSIONS. I AM BEING TOLD TO BRING IT INTO THE SHOP TO BE LOOKED AT FOR A FEE OF $72.00 AN HOUR AND THEY WOULD TRY TO DETECT THE PROBLEM. AND I AM BEING TOLD THAT SUPPOSEDLY THAT HONDA HAD EXTENDED THE WARRANTY TO 72 MONTHS OR 100,000 MILES. I CAN ONLY HOPE TO GOD THAT THIS IS TRUE. OR I AM GOING TO HAVE TO PAY AT LEAST $3,500.00 FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION.  WHY WAS I NOT TOLD ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE, OR THE TIME OF ALL THE DIFFERENT MAINTENANCE SCHEDULES I HAD DONE? I HAD RAN MY HONDA CIVIC UP TO 240,000 MILES WITH NO TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS BEFORE I PURCHASED THIS 2000 ACCORD AND I WAS GOING TO BUY A NEW 2003 ACCORD  NEXT MONTH. ALTHOUGH NOW I HAVE LOST ALL CONFIDENCE IN THE CAR THAT I HAD THOUGHT WAS THE VERY BEST ON THE MARKET! IS THIS GOING TO BE UNDER A WARRANTY?.  *JB",
