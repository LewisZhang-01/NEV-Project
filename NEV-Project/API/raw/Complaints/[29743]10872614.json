IN THE 2004 HONDA ACCORD, THE AC, RADIO, & CLOCK SHARE THE SAME DISPLAY. IT WAS RAINING THE OTHER NIGHT WHILE I WAS DRIVING AND MY WINDOWS FOGGED UP. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND THE DEFROST BUTTON AT NIGHT SINCE ALL THE DISPLAY LIGHTS STOP WORKING. THIS IS A BIG SAFETY ISSUE AND HOPEFULLY HONDA WILL STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND FIX THIS ISSUE TO ENSURE THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE SAFE WHILE DRIVING THEIR VEHICLES.",
