MY FIRST STALL HAPPENED DURING THE FIRST MONTH THAT I OWNED IT.  I WAS 4 MONTHS PREGNANT.  THE 2ND STALL HAPPENED WHILE MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING IT.  I NOW FEEL LIKE MY CAR THAT ONLY HAS 8,000 MILES ON IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE.  WHEN I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE FIRST STALL, THEY TOLD ME THAT IT HAD THE WRONG SENSOR ON IT AND REPLACED IT.  THE SECOND STALL THE DEALERSHIP COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT AND ACTED LIKE THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS.  WHAT IS FORD GOING TO DO TO FIX THE PROBLEM?        *JB",
