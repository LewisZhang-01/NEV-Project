SIX MONTHS INTO OWNING THE CAR, MY WIFE TOOK IT IN FOR A CHIP UPGRADE AND THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. WELL, A MONTH AGO, IT HAPPENED AGAIN. MY WIFE HAD THE VEHICLE SCANNED AND IT CAME UP WITH NOTHING. AGAIN, THIS MORNING, THE VEHICLE STALLED.   IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT A TWO YEAR OLD CAR SHOULD HAVE THESE PROBLEMS, AND NO ONE CAN SOLVE IT!  I AM FRUSTRATED, AND COULD USE SOME GUIDANCE ON WHERE TO GO WITH MY PROBLEM.  MY WIFE DRIVES IT DAILY FOR WORK, AND I FEAR THAT IT WILL KILL OUT WHEN SHE IS DOING 65 ON THE INTERSTATE. HELP PLEASE.  *JB",
