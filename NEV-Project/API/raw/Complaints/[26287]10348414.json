I WAS DRIVING AT A LOW SPEED AT THE TIME FORTUNATELY.  IT ENDED UP BEING THAT THE REAR AXEL BROKE.  THE MECHANIC  INDICATED IT APPEARED TO HAVE RUSTED FROM THE INSIDE OUT.  THANKFULLY THIS HAPPENED 2 DAYS AFTER A RETURN FROM VACATION AT WHICH TIME WE WERE TRAVELING 70+ MPH ON THE WEST VIRGINIA TURNPIKE. *TR",
