        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING ON 2 LANE ROAD (PUDDLES OF WATER, A LITTLE HILLY) BOTH THE 4 WD LOW AND 4 WD HIGH INDICATOR LIGHTS FLASH TOGETHER THREE TIMES FOR A SECOND OR TWO AT TWO SEPARATE TIMES.  SHORTLY AFTER, THE FRONT END DIPPED DOWN AND THE BACK END CAME FORWARD AND I ALMOST LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.  ALMOST HAD A HEAD ON COLLISION AND TOOK A BIT OF MANEUVERING TO GET THE TRUCK STRAIGHT DUE TO THE WET AREAS OF THE ROAD.  I CALLED FORD THAT NIGHT AND THEY AGREED THAT IF THE 4 WD \"KICKED\" IN IT WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE LOSS OF CONTROL.  TOOK IT TO THE TOWSON FORD THE FOLLOWING MORNING.  THEY DID A TEST DRIVE AND CHECK FOR CODES - NOTHING SHOWED UP.  THIS HAS NOT OCCURRED SINCE - BUT I AM STILL HESITANT BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY ISSUE.  NOT SURE WHAT TO DO NOW.   *NLM",
