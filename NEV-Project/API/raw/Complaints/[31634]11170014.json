THE BRAKE PEDAL BECAME VERY STIFF AND WOULD NOT STOP.  WHILE THIS DID NOT CAUSE ANY ACCIDENTS, IT WAS A NEAR MISS ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.  I TOOK IT TO THE CHEVROLET DEALER WHERE THEY SAID THE BRAKE \"VACUUM PUMP HAS FAILED\".  THEY STATED IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND WOULD COST $700.89.  THE PUMP WAS REPLACED  ON 11/28/2018, WITH NO OCCURANCES OF THIS ISSUE SINCE.  THE TRUCK HAD 59,108 MILES ON IT AT THE TIME OF VACUUM PUMP REPLACEMENT.  THE FIRST BRAKE ISSUE WAS AROUND 50,000 MILES AND HAPPENED ABOUT 8-10 TIMES BETWEEN JUNE AND NOVEMBER 2018.",
