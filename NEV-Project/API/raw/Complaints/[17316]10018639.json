AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, THE TRUCK WOULD SWAY RIGHT TO LEFT SO SEVERELY AND SUDDENLY THAT I FELT LIKE I WOULD LOSE CONTROL.  WHEN I SLOWED DOWN THE SWAYING WOULD STOP. THIS SWAYING WAS ESPECIALLY DISCONCERTING DURING WET ROAD CONDITIONS.  WHEN I CONTACTED MY LOCAL NISSAN DEALER, THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS PROBLEM.  I REPLACED THE FRONT STRUTS AND REAR SHOCKS WITHOUT ANY IMPROVEMENT.  THEN I HAD THE FRAME ADJUSTED, WITHOUT IMPROVEMENT. BETWEEN MY LOCAL REPAIR SHOP SEARCHING TECHNICAL BULLETINS AND MY SEARCH OF CONSUMER SITES THEY FOUND MY REAR CONTROL ARM AND UPPER AND LOWER BUSHINGS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $570.  OVERALL, I HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH MY PATHFINDER, BUT NISSAN NEEDS TO BE AWARE OF THIS SAFETY ISSUE AND ALSO NOTIFY OTHER PATHFINDER OWNERS.         *JB",
