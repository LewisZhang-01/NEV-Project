        "summary": "I OWN A 2003 YAMAHA 1100 V-STAR (XVS1100A) MOTORCYCLE.  CURRENTLY THIS BIKE HAS LESS THAN 875 MILES ON THE ODOMETER.  I PURCHASED IT IN EARLY SEP 02, IN MID-NOV 02, I WINTERIZED AND STORED IT.    YAMAHA DENIES ANY KNOWLEDGE OF A HISTORY OF THIS PROBLEM.    RECENTLY I HAVE BEEN READING MANY OWNER'S HORROR STORIES OF \"TWISTED STARTER BOLTS\".   HERE IS THE LINK TO THE INFORMATION ON THIS SUBJECT:  HTTP://PEOPLE.DELPHIFORUMS.COM/DADBENNY    DURING VISUAL INSPECTION TONIGHT (6 JAN 03) MY MOTORCYCLE DISPLAYS THE EARLY ONSET OF THE TWISTED STARTER BOLT PROBLEM.  IT'S SLIGHT AT THIS TIME, BUT DEFINITELY NOTICEABLE.    (THE INCIDENT DATE LISTED BELOW WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO ENTER 2003 FOR THE YEAR, THE NEAREST YEAR IT WOULD ACCEPT WAS 2002)    THROUGH MOST OF THE 1990S UP TO THE PRESENT, HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF THESE YAMAHA XVS1100S HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM WITH THE STARTER SYSTEM.  AGAIN, HERE IS A LINK TO LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF CASES:  HTTP://FORUMS.DELPHIFORUMS.COM/STAR_RIDERS/MESSAGES?MSG=35260.159    THE PROBLEM BEGINS WITH THE EXTERIOR BOLTS TWISTING AND CULMINATES IN A TOTAL INTERIOR FAILURE OF THE STARTER.    ONCE OUTSIDE OF THE LIMITED 12-MONTH WARRANTY, YAMAHA REFUSES TO PROVIDE REPAIRS AT NO COST TO THE CONSUMER, DESPITE THIS OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE PART.     AVERAGE COST TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM IS $1500 PER OCCURANCE.    EVEN IN CASES WHERE THE PROBLEM WAS FIRST REPORTED AND REPAIRED DURING THE FACTORY WARRANTY PERIOD, YAMAHA MOTOR CORPORATION HAS REFUSED TO PROVIDE REPAIR FOR ADDITIONAL LIKE FAILURES AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRATION.    THE DESIGN ON THIS PART IS OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE.  YAMAHA MOTOR CORPORATION SHOULD BE HELD LIABLE FOR FAULTY EQUIPMENT DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND MORE THAN ANYTHING, CONTINUED USE.    YAMAHA SHOULD BE FORCED TO RE-DESIGN THE STARTER SYSTEM AS WELL AS PROVIDE FREE REPLACEMENT TO ALL OWNERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM.",
