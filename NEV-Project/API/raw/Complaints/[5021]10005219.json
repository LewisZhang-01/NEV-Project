        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING MY 2001 MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE EQUIPPED WITH 17 INCH ALLOY WHEELS, GOING ABOUT 30 MILES PER HOUR, WHEN I HEARD A LOUD BANG FROM THE RIGHT FRONT AREA.  IT WAS AFTER DARK AND THE CAR SEEMED TO HANDLE OKAY SO I PROCEEDED ON BUT AFTER A SHORT DISTANCE I HEARD A SIMILAR BANG.  I PULLED OVER AND FOUND THAT THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL RIM WAS GREATLY DEFORMED AND THE TIRE KNOCKED OFF THE BEAD.  I CHANGED THE TIRE AND PROCEEDED HOME WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.  I INSPECTED THE ROAD THE FOLLOWING DAY IN ANOTHER VEHICLE AND DROVE OVER THE SAME ROUGH SPOTS AND BARELY NOTICED THEM.  THERE WERE NO SIGNIFIGANT POT HOLES IN THE ROAD.  I BELIEVE THAT A WHEEL THAT WILL FAIL SO EASILY IS A HAZARD.  IF I HAD BEEN TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND STRUCK A HOLE IN THE ROAD I BELIEVE THE TIRE WOULD HAVE GONE FLAT IMMEDIATELY AND CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST.",
