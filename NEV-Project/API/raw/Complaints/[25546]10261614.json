THEY SAID I\"N 6 YEARS I AM ONLY THE 2ND PERSON TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM\" AND \"THAT IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY\".  THEY WOULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE A MANUFACTURER DEFECT OR PROBLEM.  I AM JUST WRITING HERE TO GET THIS INFORMATION ON RECORD, BECAUSE IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON PROBLEM AND THAT THIS IS VERY TYPICAL WITH FORD VEHICLES.  THANK YOU *TR",
