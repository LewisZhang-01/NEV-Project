        "summary": "I STARTED MY TRUCK UP AND HEARD A VIBRATING NOISE AND THE ABS LIGHT CAME ON.  WHEN I SHUT OFF MY TRUCK THE NOISE CONTINUED.  I UNHOOKED THE BATTERY CABLE UNTIL I DETERMINED THE PROBLEM WAS THE ELECTO-HYDRAULIC CONTROL UNIT.  I PULLED THE FUSE AND CHECKED WITH MY DEALER.  THE SERVICE MANAGER ADVISED ME THAT BOTH PARTS OF THE UNIT (BPMV AND EBCM) USUALLY NEED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF APPROX. 1600.00 FOR PARTS ALONE.  THIS TRUCK HAS ONLY 42,000 MILES ON IT.  I ALSO CHANGED THE BRAKE FLUID AT 30,000 MILES  IN ORDER TO AVOID THIS PROBLEM.  I CONSIDER THE REPLACEMENT COST FOR THESE PARTS TO BE OUTRAGEOUS. THE FUSE CAN BE LEFT OUT AND THE VEHICLE CAN BE DRIVEN WITHOUT THE ANTI-LOCK FEATURE WORKING.  I CONSIDER THIS A SAFETY DEFECT BECAUSE VERY FEW PEOPLE WILL PAY THIS PRICE TO HAVE THE ANTI-LOCKING FEATURE RESTORED.  IN ADDITION, THE ABS AND BRAKE WARNING LIGHT COME ON AND CANNOT BE CLEARED WHEN DRIVEN WITH THE FUSE PULLED.  THIS CAN CAUSE A DRIVER TO MISS OTHER PROBLEMS THAT WOULD BE INDICATED BY THE BRAKE WARNING LIGHT.      *TT",
