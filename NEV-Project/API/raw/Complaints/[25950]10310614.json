TWO WERE IN THE SAME AREA WHERE I WAS SLOWING TO TURN INTO A BUSINESS AND WHILE BRAKING I HIT SEVERAL SMALL POT HOLES IN THE ROAD.  AS SOON AS I HIT THE POTHOLES I HAD A SUDDEN BRIEF ACCELERATION WHERE MY BRAKES DID NOT SEEM TO WORK.  IN A SHORT TIME THE BRAKES SEEM TO TAKE HOLD.  SINCE THERE HAS BEEN THE RECALL AND ISSUES WITH ACCELERATING WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL MY CAR HAS BEEN PARKED.  I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THE VEHICLE LOOKED AT ON THURSDAY, BUT I HAVE NOT RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE.  *TR",
