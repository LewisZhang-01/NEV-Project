IN ORDER TO NOT MAKE MY CAR STALL - I WOULD JUST GIVE IT A LOT OF EXTRA GAS TO ENSURE THAT IT WOULDN'T STALL.       THE PROBLEM OCCURS REGULARLY - ALMOST EVERY TIME I DRIVE (ABOUT 1 TIME A WEEK).  THE PROBLEM ONLY OCCURS WHEN STARTING AND STOPPING AND SHIFTING IN THE LOW GEARS.      AFTER THIS PROBLEM STARTED IN FEB OF 2010 - I TOOK THE CAR TO A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP.  THEY HOOKED THE CAR UP TO A COMPUTER AND SAID IT WAS FINE.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY ALSO TOOK THE CAR ON A DRIVE TO SEE IF IT WOULD DO IT THEN, AND THEY CLAIMED IT DIDN'T.  SO NOTHING WAS DONE AT THE THAT TIME.  WHEN I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP, THE CAR CONTINUED TO SHIFT HARSHLY. *TR",
