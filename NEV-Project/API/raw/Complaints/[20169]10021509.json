        "summary": "I WAS TRAVELING BY AUTO THROUGH WICHITA, KS, LAST FRIDAY ON I-135, ENROUTE HOME TO DALLAS.  A CEMENT WALL WAS ON MY LEFT (CONSTRUCTION), A SEMI-TRUCK  WAS ON MY RIGHT/FRONT/REAR.  I WAS TRAVELING WITH TRAFFIC AT APPROX. 65 MPH  WHEN A LARGE FIRE EXTINGUISHER APPEARED IN THE ROAD.  I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO HIT IT, WHICH EXPLODED MY LEFT FRONT TIRE, THROWING THE EXTINGUISHER UNDER MY CAR.  I WAS ABLE TO GET ABOUT 100 YDS FURTHER TO PULL OFF, MAINTAINING CONTROL OF MY VEHICLE.  THE 3 STATE TROOPERS THAT CAME BY A FEW MINUTES LATER WERE ABLE TO REMOVE THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER FROM THE ROAD.  THEY SAID THAT SINCE THE REQUIREMENT FOR SEMI'S TO CARRY A FIRE EXTINGUISHER WENT INTO  EFFECT, THEY WERE ALWAYS HAVING TO PICK UP FIRE EXTINGUISHERS LOST BY THE TRUCKS.  I CAN SEE THE NEED FOR CARRYING FIRE EXTINGUISHERS, BUT IT CONCERNS ME THAT THEY AREN'T SECURED BETTER.  HAD THE EXTINGUISHER BEEN AIRBORNE, IT WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD AND PROBABLY KILLED ME AND SOMEONE IN THE NEXT TRAFFIC LANE.  *JB",
