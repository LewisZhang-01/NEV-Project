THIS CONDITION ONLY HAPPENS IN OVER DRIVE WHILE COASTING OR BRAKING. THIS DIMMING COULD BE MISUNDERSTOOD BY OTHER DRIVERS AS FLASHING AND COULD CAUSE A DISTRACTION. IT ALSO COULD LEAD TO A PREOCCUPATION AS TO WHY AS THIS GUY KEEPS FLASHING ME. DURING BRAKING IN TRAFFIC CONDITION THIS COULD CAUSE A DISTRACTION FOR THE CAR AHEAD BEING FLASHED CAUSING HIM TO LOOK IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR INSTEAD OF A HEAD.  AS FOR THE ALL THESE LIGHTS DIMMING IN ABOUT ONE-SECOND INTERVALS THIS CAUSES ME TO BECOME DISTRACTED AS WELL. I HAVE CONTACTED SATURN AND THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND NO REPAIR CAN BE MADE AT THIS TIME.      *JB",
