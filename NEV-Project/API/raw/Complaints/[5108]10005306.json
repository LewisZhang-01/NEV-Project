DEALER AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT MY CORVETTE DIDN'T FALL WITHIN CERTAIN VIN NUMBERS FOR THAT RECALL FOR THAT VERY SAME PROBLEM  AND THAT IT SHOULDN'T HAVE THAT PROBLEM. WELL, IT DOES HAVE THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS PROBLEM, BUT GM WONT FIX THEIR FAULTY DESIGN/PARTS AND WANT TO CHARGE ME $500 MINIMUM TO FIX! SO I HAD THE CAR TOWED HOME, ATE THE $100 FLAT BED TOW BILL, AND CALLED OTHER GM DEALERS-ALL DENY THE PROBLEM ON MY PARTICULAR CAR. CAN ANYBODY HELP ME? IF I WERE BACKING ONTO A BUSY ROAD, IT COULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS. MY CAR IS A 1997 C5 CORVETTE VIN# [XXX]   W/APPROX ONLY 30,000 MILES.
