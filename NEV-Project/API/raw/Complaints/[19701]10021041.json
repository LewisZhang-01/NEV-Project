MY CAR FELT FOR A FEW DAYS THAT IT DID NOT ACCELERATE WHEN I PRESSED ON THE PEDAL.  I TOOK IT IN YESTERDAY TO HAVE THE OIL CHANGED AND SEE WHAT THE MATTER WAS.  NOTHING WAS FOUND WRONG WITH THE CAR BY THE MECHANIC.  WELL, TODAY I FOUND OUT WHAT THE MATTER WAS. AS I WAS DRIVING ON MY WAY TO MY SON'S DAYCARE THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL CAME OFF THE FLOOR.  I HAD NO PEDAL.  I PULLED TO THE SIDE AND INDEED THE CABLE AND PEDAL WERE LAYING ON THE FLOOR.  I MANAGED TO GET TO THE MECHANIC BY TRYING THE CAR TO MOVE. THE MECHANIC SAID THAT THE CABLE SNAPPED AND THAT IT HAD TO BE REPLACED.  *NLM",
