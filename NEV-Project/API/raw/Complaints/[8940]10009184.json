BOTH TIMES THE CAR WAS ACCELERATING ONTO AN INTERSTATE & THE DRIVER WAS ABLE TO PULL OFF ONTO THE SHOULDER. THIS COULD HAVE RESULTED IN FATALITIES IF IT HAPPENED WHILE PASSING ON A 2 LANE ROAD. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY FORD JUST DIDN'T GLUE THE PART TOGETHER INSTEAD OF USING PRESSURE TO KEEP THE CLIP ON SINCE OBVIOUSLY THE CLIP FALLS OFF. *TS  ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12-12-02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS***761509",
