TODAY (5/4/03) SHE SLAMMED THE REAR DOOR (CARGO \"TRUNK\" HATCH) AND AS IT SLAMMED, A SPACE WAS BRIEFLY CREATED BETWEEN THE REAR WINDOW AND THE WINDOW FRAME. THEN THE WINDOW WAS TIGHT IN ITS FRAME AGAIN. I THINK IT DOES THAT TO LET SOME OF THE AIR PRESSURE ESCAPE AS YOU SLAM THE DOOR. HER HAND WAS NEAR ENOUGH TO THE WINDOW,  WHEN THIS HAPPENED, HER RIGHT PINKIE FINGER WENT INTO THAT SPACE AND WAS CRUSHED.  SHE IS CURRENTLY IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM HAVING X-RAYS PERFORMED, AND HAVING THE END OF HER FINGER (HOPEFULLY) SEWN BACK ON. *JB",
