        "summary": "I OWN A 2001 VW BEETLE. BOUGHT RIGHT OFF THE SHOW ROOM FLOOR. PAID A PRETTY PRICE FOR IT TOO. MY CAR WAS RUNNING GREAT UNTIL JANUARY OF 2003, LESS THAN TWO YEARS AFTER I BOUGHT IT. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND I NOTICED THE CAR WAS SHAKING AND CUTTING OUT REALLY BAD. I BARELY MADE IT HOME THAT NIGHT. I TOOK IT IN TO BE REPAIRED IN MAY OF 2003, COSTING ME A HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL. IT WASN'T 6 DAYS LATER IT DID IT AGAIN, SAME THING. SO I CALLED THE DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT IT. THEY TOLD ME IT WAS GOING TO COST ANOTHER HUNDRED DOLLARS TO FIX IT. WASN'T HAPPENING. I GOT A HOLD OF THE MAIN MAN IN CHARGE OF SERVICE, TOLD HIM MY PROBLEM AND HE WAVED THE FEE. WHEN I GOT UP THERE THE NEXT WEEK, THEY TOLD ME IT COULD BE 1-250 DIFFERENT THINGS WRONG WHEN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS FLASHING. OK, I AM STARTING TO DO SOME MATH HERE. 250 POSSIBLE THINGS WRONG X $100= $25,000!!!!!!! I COULD BUY A HOUSE FOR THAT MUCH MONEY. AND THE CAR ISN'T WORTH ANYWHERE NEAR THAT MUCH NOW. IT'S LIKE I WOULD BE PAYING FOR IT ALL OVER AGAIN AND WHO'S TO SAY THE PROBLEM WOULD EVEN GET FIXED? IT COULD JUST KEEP GOING IN CIRCLES. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALL OF YOU, BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY. I AM MAKING CLOSE TO $500 PAYMENTS A MONTH ON THIS CAR WITH THREE YEARS STILL LEFT TO GO ON IT. YOU WOULD THINK A CAR COSTING THAT MUCH AND ALL THE HYPE THEY PUSHED ON IT THAT IT WOULD RUN BETTER THAN WHAT IT DOES AND WOULD HAVE LASTED LONGER THAN IT DID. TO ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE THINKING ABOUT BUYING A VW BEETLE, TAKE IT  FROM AN OWNER, DON'T!!!!!*JB",
