I DID NOT BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY AND MY 3 YEAR/36,000 MILE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED BY 6000 MILES.  I HAD A REMOTE CAR STARTER INSTALLED BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD THE REMOTE STARTER MORE THAN LIKELY DID NOT CAUSE THE STARTER TO FAIL.  A BRAND NEW, OR 2 YEAR OLD CAR'S STARTER SHOULD NOT HAVE FAILED SO SOON.  IS THERE ANY WAY TO GET REIMBURSED FOR MY REPAIR AND BRAND NEW STARTER'S COST OF $405.00 BY EITHER THE DEALER OF THE VEHICLE OR THE MANUFACTURER OR INSTALLER OF THE REMOTE CAR STARTER?  *JB",
