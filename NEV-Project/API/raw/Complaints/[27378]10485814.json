AFTER FOUR SEPARATE BRAKE FAILURES AND SUBSEQUENT DELIVERIES OF THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP, THE PROBLEM WAS DIAGNOSED AS A FAULTY VALVE IN THE BRAKE ACTUATOR. SYMPTOMS: ACCUMULATOR PUMP RUNNING EVERY 10 TO 15 SECONDS WHEN IT SHOULD RUN ONLY OCCASIONALLY. DEALERSHIP STATES THAT DIAGNOSTICS REVEALED THAT NO BRAKING WAS AVAILABLE TO THE REAR WHEELS AT POINT OF FAILURE. THE ACTUATOR WAS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY AT 55,218 MILES. TWO WEEKS SUBSEQUENT TO THE WARRANTY REPAIR, A FIFTH BRAKING FAILURE OCCURRED (OCTOBER 30, 2012). THIS TIME WITH A WARNING TONE (NOT HEARD ON PREVIOUS FAILURES). THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN. DEALERSHIP STATES THE NEW ACTUATOR HAD FAILED DUE TO A FAULTY VOLTAGE REGULATOR. THE ACTUATOR WAS REPLACED AGAIN UNDER WARRANTY. 23 DAYS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE LAST FAILURE AND THE BRAKES ARE WORKING NORMALLY. IT SEEMS THAT THE BRAKE ACTUATOR (THE SQUARE ALUMINUM MODULE UNDER THE HOOD ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE WITH MANY HYDRAULIC LINES COMING OUT OF IT) IS A WEAK COMPONENT IN THE TOYOTA 2007 CAMRY HV.  *TR",
