LAST WEEK DURING A HEAVY RAIN THEY STOPPED IN MID CYCLE. I PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND ,AS I SLOWED DOWN THEY BEGAN TO WORK. THEY DID NOT STOP AGAIN BUT THEY DID HESITATE 3 OR 4 TIMES OVER THE NEXT 15 MINUTES.  I WAS TOLD BY LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALER THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE 1997 TAHOE FOR FAILURE OF THE WINDSHIELD WIPER MODULE.   MY TAHOE WAS AN EARLY 98 PRODUCTION.  DO I  HAVE A WINDSHIELD WIPER MODULE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECALLED?    *NLM",
