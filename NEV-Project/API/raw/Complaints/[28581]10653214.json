THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THE CLUTCH HAD TO BE REPLACED, A COMMON ISSUE WITH THE FORD FIESTA. AFTER THE CLUTCH WAS REPLACED, THE GRINDING SOUND REMAINED. EVEN WITH A NEW CLUTCH, THE CAR MAKES ME NERVOUS. NEEDLESS TO SAY, DISSATISFIED WITH THIS SERVICE DEPARTMENT, I DESCRIBED THE GRINDING SOUND TO A SERVICE MANAGER AT ANOTHER DEALERSHIP. HE TOLD ME THE GRINDING IS NORMAL AND THAT THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE. SO I STARTED READING AROUND AND LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF FIESTA OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME THING. AND WE ARE BEING TOLD THE SAME THING: IT'S NORMAL, FIXING THE CLUTCH WON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM, REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION WON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM. IT'S AS IF FORD IS TRYING TO RUN OUT THE CLOCK ON THE 60,000 MILE FULL WARRANTY. AT THIS TIME, I WANT TO TAKE MY FIESTA TO SOMEONE BUT DON'T HAVE ANY RECOURSE SINCE FORD DEALERSHIPS ARE BEING TOLD TO TELL FIESTA OWNERS THAT \"IT'S NORMAL, THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE.\"  *TR",
