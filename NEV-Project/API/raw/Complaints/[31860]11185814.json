I HAD TO USE A HEAT GUN TO THAW THE LATCH SO THE DOOR WOULD PROPERLY LATCH SHUT.  LUCKILY ON THE OTHER 5 OCCASIONS WHERE THE LATCH WAS FROZEN, I WAS AT HOME AND WAS ABLE TO USE A HEAT GUN TO THAW THE LATCH ENOUGH SO THAT THE DOOR WOULD CLOSE PROPERLY.  I HAVE ONLY EXPERIENCED THIS ISSUE WITH MY DRIVER DOOR.  AS OF TODAY, 3/11/2019, MY TRUCK IS AT VAN HORN FORD OF OCONOMOWOC (WISCONSIN) HAVING SAFETY RECALL 18N03 PERFORMED.",
