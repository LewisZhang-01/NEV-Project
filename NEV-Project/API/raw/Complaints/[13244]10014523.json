I HAVE HAD TO PULL OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WHEN THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE ONCE THE CURVE IS PASSED, I DO NOT IMMEDIATELY GET FUEL BACK TO THE ENGINE.  I HAVE AVOIDED SEVERAL ACCIDENTS BECAUSE OF THIS.  THIS HAS BEEN A RECURRING ISSUE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS, BUT IT'S GETTING WORSE.  IT ORIGINALLY STARTED WITH A 1/4 TANK OR LESS.  NOW IT'S A 1/2 TANK OR LESS.  IT'S STARTING TO WORRY ME.  THIS HAPPENS AT NORMAL DRIVING SPEEDS AND IS MUCH WORSE WHEN TRYING TO ACCELERATE INTO TRAFFIC FROM AN OFF-RAMP. *JB",
