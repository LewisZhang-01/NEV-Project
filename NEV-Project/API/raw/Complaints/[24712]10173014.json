        "summary": "DT*: THE CONTACT STATED WHILE DRIVING 30 MPH ON NORMAL ROAD CONDITIONS, THERE WAS A LOUD POPPING SOUND FROM THE FRONT LEFT SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD. THE SOUND ALSO OCCURRED WHEN DRIVING ON ROUGH ROADS.  THE SALES/SERVICE DEALER WAS NOTIFIED AND THE VEHICLE WAS INSPECTED. WHEN THE CONTACT DROVE THE VEHICLE AGAIN, THE PROBLEM CONTINUED, SO THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO THE SALES/SERVICE DEALER. THE SALES/SERVICE DEALER REFUSED TO PROVIDE A REFUND, REPLACE THE VEHICLE OR TO REPLACE THE SEAL TO THE WINDSHIELD. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED.  *NM  THE CONSUMER FOUND A SERVICE BULLETIN REGARDING  IMPROPERLY SEALED WINDSHIELDS (MOLDING PROBLEMS) THAT CAUSE POPPING/RATTLING NOISE.  THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER BUT THEY CLAIMED THEY COULD NOT HEAR THE NOISE.  *NM  THE FUSE BOX UNDER THE HOOD NEAR THE DASHBOARD AND IN THE INTERIOR OF THE CAR WERE TIGHTENED BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOSE. THIS AFFECTED THE DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS. THE LEFT FRONT STRUT AND THE FIREWALL WERE TOO CLOSE AND WERE RUBBING TOGETHER. THE GASKETS WERE SHRINKING AROUND THE WINDSHIELD WHICH WERE CAUSING THE WINDSHIELD VIBRATING PROBLEMS. THE WINDSHIELD SPRAYER WAS CLOGGED. THE EXHAUST HEAT SHIELDS WERE LOOSE. THE FRONT DOOR WINDOW CHANNELS WERE LUBRICATED AND FINALLY REPLACED BECAUSE OF THE EXCESSIVE RATTLING NOISE. THE DOOR JAMBS WERE IRREGULAR WHICH ADDED TO THE WINDOW RATTLING PROBLEM.  UPDATED 01/10/08 . *JB",
