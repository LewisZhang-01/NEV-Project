WHEN I PRESSED THE BRAKES THEY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN AND THE CAR DID NOT SLOW DOWN AT ALL. I ALMOST LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR, BECAUSE WHILE I WAS TURNING THE CAR JERKED BACK AND THEN FORWARD REALLY HARD. THE SECOND TIME IT HAPPENED WAS AT A STOP SIGN. I ALMOST HIT THE CAR GOING STRAIGHT BECAUSE THE CAR WOULDN'T STOP AND THE BRAKES WOULD JUST GO ALL THE WAY DOWN. THIS PROBLEM HAPPENED 2 TIMES IN A ROW.",
