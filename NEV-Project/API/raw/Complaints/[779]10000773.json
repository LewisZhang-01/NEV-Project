        "summary": "I LOST THE POWER STEERING ON MY 1999 FORD TAURUS STATION WAGON.  WHEN IT STOPPED WORKING, I HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME TURNING AROUND CORNERS.  I HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME MAKING A LEFT TURN INTO MY DRIVEWAY.  I THEN BECAME AFRAID TO DRIVE IT AS I DID NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH TO MAKE A TURN.  I HAD TO HAVE A MALE FRIEND WHO IS FAR STRONGER THAN ME, DRIVE THE CAR TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIRS.  MY CAR ONLY HAS 41,000 MILES ON IT.  THIS IS NOT A PART THAT SHOULD WEAR OUT.  I WAS ADVISED BY THE DEALER THAT THE RACK AND PINION SEALS HAD LEAKED AND THAT THE WHOLE RACK AND PINION STEERING HAD TO BE REPLACED FOR A TOTAL BILL OF $734.51.  I FEEL THAT THIS PART ITSELF IS DEFECTIVE AND IT ALSO COULD BE QUITE DANGEROUS WHEN A DRIVER IS NOT ABLE TO NEGOTIATE A TURN AS EXPECTED.    I WOULD APPRECIATE ALL YOU COULD DO TO INVESTIGATE THE POWER STEERING EQUIPMENT USED ON THE 1999 FORD TAURUS. THE INCIDENT DATE IS JAN. 2, 2003 BUT YOUR COMPUTER  SYSTEM ONLY GOES TO 2002.",
