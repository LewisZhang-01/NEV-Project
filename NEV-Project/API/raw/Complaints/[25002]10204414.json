IN MARCH 2006 I STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS WHERE THE CAR WHEN ATTEMPTED TO START WOULD TAKE A FEW SECONDS EXTRA AND THEN START, THEN 6 MONTHS LATER I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE STREET AND THE CAR JUST CUT OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION. THE CAR RESTARTED ABOUT 10 MINUTES LATER. THEN IN NOVEMBER THIS STARTED HAPPENING MORE AN MORE FREQUENTLY. ONE NIGHT IN DECEMBER THE CAR CUT OFF AND WOULD NOT RESTART AT ALL. I WAS ABLE TO PULL OF THE ROAD. I WAITED AN HOUR AND STILL THE CAR WOULD NOT START. I CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY AND THE CAR WOULD NOT START. I GOT THE CAR TOWED TO A MECHANIC WHO SAID THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS THE FUEL PUMP SO I REPLACED THAT AND THE CAR WORKED FOR 2 DAYS AND THEN THE SAME PROBLEM AGAIN. HE THEN TESTED THE CAR AND SAW THERE WAS NO POWER GOING TO THE FUEL PUMP. I HAD HIM DO A TEMPORARY FIX AND RUN A LINE FROM THE BATTERY TO THE FUEL PUMP SO THE CAR WOULD STILL START. THEN EVERYTHING ELSE SLOWLY STARTED TO FAIL. THE AIR BAG LIGHT WOULD COME ON INTERMITTENTLY AND NOW STAYS ON. ONE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHT WENT OUT AND THEN THE OTHER FOLLOWED BY MY HIGH BEAM TOTALLY. MY FRONT LEFT TURN SIGNAL WENT THEN THE REAR RIGHT FOLLOWED BY THE FRONT RIGHT. MY HORN NO LONGER WORKS. I DON'T KNOW IF MY AIRBAGS WOULD DEPLOY IF I WAS IN AN ACCIDENT. THE WINDSHIELD WIPER RECENTLY STOPPED WORKING AS WELL.  *JB",
