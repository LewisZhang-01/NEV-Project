DOES NOT MATTER WHAT   SETTING THE MODE DOOR IS IN. VEHICLE NO LONGER BLOWS HOT AIR WHEN HEAT IS ON THEREFORE THE DEFROSTER WILL NOT BLOW HOT AIR AS WELL. THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD! IF WINDOWS ARE FOGGED OR ICED DURING INCLEMENT WEATHER YOU CAN NOT SEE AND COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT RESULTING IN FATALITIES. I FOUND OVER 500 COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET. PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE WITH A PLASTIC TEMPERATURE DOOR VALVE (TEMPERATURE BLEND DOOR) THAT IS BROKEN.THE COST IS OVER 1,000 AND I AM BEING TOLD GM WILL NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. I HAVE TWO SMALL CHILDREN AND WE ARE FREEZING IN MY CAR THAT I BOUGHT TO BE A \"FAMILY\" VEHICLE. THIS IS JUST ONE MORE PROBLEM TO THE LIST OF THINGS I HAVE ALREADY HAD FIXED IN THIS CAR SINCE I BOUGHT IT.   *TR",
