ABOUT 10 SECONDS LATER OUR REAR PASSENGER TIRE EXPLODED CAUSING OUR VEHICLE TO JERK TO THE RIGHT AND WEAVE BACK AND FORTH.  WE WERE ABLE TO PULL OFF OF THE ROAD AND WHEN INSPECTING THE TIRE, BLACK SMOKE WAS ROLLING FROM THE TIRE AND THE TIRE WAS IN SHREDS.  THE WALL OF THE TIRE COMPLETELY EXPLODED.  THE TIRES WERE PUCHASED ABOUT 1 YEAR AGO.  THEY ARE HANKOOK DYNAPRO A7-M P245/65R17 TIRES.  THEY ARE NOT ON THE RECALL LIST, BUT SHOULD BE.  WE ARE NOW SCARED TO DRIVE THE CAR FOR FEAR ONE OF THE THREE OTHER HANKOOK TIRES WILL EXPLODE.  WE ARE THANKFUL THAT WE WERE NOT INVOLVED IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT AS OUR GRANDSON WAS IN HIS CARSEAT IN THE BACKSEAT OF THE PASSENGER SIDE.  *TR",
