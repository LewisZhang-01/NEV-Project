I PULLED INTO A PARKING LOT, SHUT OFF THE ENGINE AND RESTARTED IT AND THE LIGHT WENT OUT. I DROVE IT TO AN AUTO SHOP AND THEY COULD NOT DETECT A MALFUNCTION CODE. TODAY, NOV 5, 2014 WHEN LEAVING MY NEIGHBORHOOD, THE SAME LOSS OF SPEED OCCURRED IN 2ND GEAR AND THE WRENCH AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. I DROVE BACK TO THE LOCAL AUTO SHOP AND THEY DETERMINED THE THROTTLE BODY WAS DEFECTIVE. THE SOLENOID WAS BAD. FORTUNATELY, MY INCIDENTS HAPPENED AT A LOW SPEED. THIS COULD BE CATASTROPHIC AT HIGH SPEED, RUNNING THE RISK OF A HIGH-SPEED, REAR-END COLLISION.  *TR",
