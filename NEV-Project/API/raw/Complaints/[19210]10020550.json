CHEVROLET REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE A PROBLEM WITH THE SUNROOF. THE GUY THAT OWNS THE PLACE WHERE I AM HAVING IT REPAIRED SAYS HE HAS REPLACED HUNDREDS OF THEM ON THE MONTE CARLO. CHEVROLET USED A PLASTIC TRACK INSTEAD OF A METAL TRACK AND THAT IS WHY THEY BREAK.  IT IS A MINIMUM OF A $1300 CHARGE TO REPLACE THIS SUNROOF.  CHEVROLET COULD HAVE USED AN ALUMINUM TRACK AND HAVE AVOIDED THIS FINANCIAL DRAIN ON THE CONSUMER.          *TT",
