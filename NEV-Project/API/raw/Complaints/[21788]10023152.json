        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 97 MAZDA MILLENNIA IN 8/97 WITH 29K MILES.  TODAY IT IS AT 77K MILES AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND FOUND THAT THE FUEL TANK HAS STARTED IMPLODING DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF SUCTION IN THE TANK.  THE SUCTION HAS ALSO CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE FUEL LEVEL SENSORS.  THE QUOTED REPAIR PRICE WAS $1,800.  THE SERVICE REP INFORMED ME THAT MAZDA IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND HAS ISSUED AN ADVISORY TO MECHANICS TO NOT ONLY CHECK THE FUEL GAUGE BUT ALSO THE FUEL TANK.  THIS IS NOT CURRENTLY A RECALL ITEM OR A DEFECT BUT SHOULD BE.  I HAVE DONE RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND SEVERAL CASES OF OTHER MILLENNIA OWNERS WITH SAME MODEL YEAR EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE REPAIRS SHOULD BE AT MAZDA'S EXPENSE SINCE THE SUCTION IN THE TANK IS TOO HIGH OR THE FUEL TANK ITSELF IS NOT STRUCTURALLY CAPABLE OF HANDLING THE PRESSURE.  PLEASE ISSUE A RECALL/DEFECT NOTICE SO THAT THIS ISSUE CAN BE FIXED.  *NLM",
