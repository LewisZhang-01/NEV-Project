I CONTACTED THE DEALER AND HE REFUSED TO HONOR THE SIX YEAR WARRANTY ON THE BATTERY BECAUSE MY VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY DUE TO MILEAGE. I CONTACTED AN AC DELCO SERVICE CENTER AND THEY REFUSED TO HONOR THE SIX YEAR WARRANTY ON THE BASIS THAT WHEN THE WARRANTY ON THE TRUCK EXPIRED, SO DID THEIR SIX YEAR WARRANTY THAT IS NO GOOD. THAT IS NOT FAIR TO THE CONSUMER. I HOPE YOU CAN HELP AS I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE WITH AC DELCO BATTERY.  *PH  *JB    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**768029",
