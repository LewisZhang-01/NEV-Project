I CHECKED MY TRUCK AND 3 STRANDS OF THE CABLE HAD SEPARATED, AND IT LOOKED LIKE THE CABLE WAS NEARLY AT THE HALF WAY POINT. I CHECKED WITH THE LOCAL DEALER, AND WAS TOLD THAT I COULD PURCHASE A NEW ONE FOR APPROXIMATELY $50.00. THIS NEW HOIST CABLE ASSEMBLY IS A NEW DESIGN, AND SHOULD NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM. WHAT MAKES ME MAD IS THAT WE ARE NOT BEING NOTIFIED ABOUT THIS POTENTIAL PROBLEM. WHEN I CHECKED MY OWNERS MANUAL, IT SHOWS THE NEW IMPROVED HOIST ASSEMBLY. NO ACCIDENT OCCURRED, BUT IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE IT WOULD HAVE OCCURRED.   *NLM",
