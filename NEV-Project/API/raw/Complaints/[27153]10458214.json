THE SYMPTOMS WOULD MYSTERIOUSLY GO AWAY WHEN THE CAR WAS AT THE DEALER OR IN THE SHOP. WITH 149K, WHILE DRIVING AT 65MPH  THE TRANSMISSION  ABRUPTLY DOWNSHIFTED INTO SECOND GEAR CAUSING THE SPEED TO BE QUICKLY REDUCED WITHOUT THE BREAKS BEING APPLIED, CREATING AN UNSAFE AND INOPERABLE VEHICLE.  THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THAT IT HAPPENS WITHOUT WARNING. YOU ARE DRIVING NORMALLY, THEN OUT OF NOWHERE YOUR CAR'S TRANSMISSION DOWNSHIFTS TO A LOW GEAR.  *TR",
