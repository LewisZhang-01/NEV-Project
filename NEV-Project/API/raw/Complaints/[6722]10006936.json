        "summary": "VEHICLE HAS A SLIGHT VIBRATION AT 65 MPH THAT INCREASES IN SEVERITY AS SPEED INCREASES. AT 85 MPH IT HAS A VERY PRONOUNCED VIBRATION THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED DANGEROUS. VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO DEALER FOUR TIMES. THE DEALER ESSENTIALLY TOLD CUSTOMER THAT FORD WOULD NOT WARRANTY A VEHICLE OVER THE LEGAL SPEED LIMIT. THIS WAS THE FINAL ANSWER AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO CONVINCE THE CUSTOMER OF OTHER CAUSES, MOST OF WHICH WERE ESSENTIALLY RIDICULOUS. (THE CUSTOMER WAS IN THE AUTO REPAIR BUSINESS FOR 17 YEARS.) THE CUSTOMER TOOK THE TECHNICIAN FOR A TEST DRIVE TO DEMONSTRATE THE SEVERE VIBRATION. THE TECHNICIAN PROPOSED THE POSSIBILITY OF A DEFECTIVE REAR DRIVE LINE. THE TECHNICIAN'S SUPERVISOR THEN DROVE THE VEHICLE HIMSELF THEN STATED THE VEHICLE DEFINITELY HAD A PRONOUNCED VIBRATION, BUT FORD WOULD NOT WARRANTY THE PROBLEM. SINCE THE VIBRATION WAS DISCOVERED WHILE PASSING AN OBVIOUSLY INTOXICATED DRIVER (FOR SAFETY REASONS), THE CUSTOMER DEFINITELY CONSIDERS THIS A SAFETY HAZARD. AFTER VIEWING SEVERAL OTHER COMPLAINTS AT THE NHTSA SITE, IT IS ALL TO OBVIOUS THAT THIS ANSWER/REFUSAL IS BECOMING A VERY COMMON PRACTICE AMONG FORD DEALERS.    *PH    *NLM    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**769763",
