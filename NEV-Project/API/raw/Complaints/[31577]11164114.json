DURING SEVERAL OF THESE DANGEROUS BREAKING EVENTS NO VEHICLES OR OBJECTS WERE IN FRONT OF ME. I HAVE ALMOST BEEN RARE ENDED BECAUSE OF THE BREAKING. I HAVE NOTICED THAT EVEN S SHADOW FROM A TREE CAN TRIGGER THE SENSOR TO MAKE THE BREAKING SYSTEM TURN ON MAKING THE CAR COME TO A SUDDEN STOP. THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN THIS FEATURE COMPLETELY OFF. WHEN YOU TURN IT OFF IT RESETS ONCE YOU TURN THE IGNITION TO START THE CAR AGAIN. THIS RECALL NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW BEFORE SOMEONE GETS INJURED OR KILLED.",
