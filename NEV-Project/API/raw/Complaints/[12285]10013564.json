        "summary": "RIDING MY 2001 HARLEY-DAVIDSON 1200S (SPORTSTER 1200 SPORT) HOME FROM WORK AND THE BRAKES LOCKED UP.  WEATHER CONDITIONS: MIST/LIGHT RAIN.  THE BIKE HAD JUST HAD ITS 10K SERVICE DONE A FEW WEEKS PRIOR AT LOCAL H-D DEALERSHIP AND THEY ALSO PUT ON NEW TIRES FRONT & REAR.  THE BIKE SHOOK VIOLENTLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE AND I  ENDED UP LAYING IT DOWN.  MY R KNEE WAS SCRAPED UP AND MY L HAND SWOLLEN AND L ANKLE BRUISED.  VERY LUCKY AS I WAS WEARING LEATHER JACKET AND BOOTS.  NO BROKEN BONES.  INS CO (PROGRESSIVE) SUGGESTED A DIFFERENT SHOP (NOT DEALER) THAT THEY USE.  THE SHOP IS STILL WAITING ON HANDLEBARS FROM H-D.  OTHER PARTS FINALLY CAME IN.  THE REPAIR SHOP SAID THAT BOTH THE FRONT AND REAR BRAKES WERE LOCKED UP AND THE L FRONT ROTOR WAS WARPED.  AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, I'M NOT VERY HAPPY THAT THIS HAPPENED JUST AFTER SERVICING.  I'VE BEEN WITHOUT TRANSPORTATION FOR OVER A MONTH NOW.  DON'T KNOW WHY H-D CAN'T SUPPLY HANDLEBARS ANY QUICKER FOR A 2 YEAR OLD BIKE.  NOTE:  A SNAP-ON TOOL DEALER FRIEND IN COLORADO HAS A CLIENT THAT ALSO HAS A 2001 SPORTSTER (NOT THE SPORT MODEL) THAT THE BRAKES LOCKED UP ON DRY PAVEMENT.  HE DID NOT CRASH, BUT HAS HAD OTHER BRAKE PROBLEMS AS IN NOT STOPPING VERY QUICKLY, ETC.  ANOTHER NOTE:  (RE: PERSONS COMPLAINT ON OIL LEAKS, LEAK AROUND AIR CLEANER) I GOT THE BIKE WHEN IT HAD 5 K MILES ON IT.  BOUGHT IT IN AZ AND RODE TO HOUSTON, TX.  THE BIKE STARTED LEAKING AROUND THE ROCKER BOXES AND LOCAL TX DEALER SAID IT WAS A \"COMMON PROBLEM\" ON SPORTSTERS.  DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN ON THIS, BUT WHATEVER THEY DID TO IT FIXED IT.  (NO COST TO ME AS I HAD A 1 YEAR EXTENDED WARRANTY).  MY BIKE HAS THE SCREAMIN' EAGLE CARB KIT AND I ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH OIL LEAKING ON THE AIR CLEANER.  OCCASIONAL OIL DRIPPING ONTO THE EXHAUST ALSO.  I DON'T HAVE VIN # OR PURCHASE DATE WITH ME AT THE MOMENT, BUT CAN GET IT FOR YOU.     *NLM",
