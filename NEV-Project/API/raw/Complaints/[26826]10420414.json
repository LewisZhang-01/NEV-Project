THIS CAUSED ALL OF THE OIL TO QUICKLY LEAVE THE ENGINE AND COAT THE RIGHT REAR TIRE. I WAS LUCKY I WAS DRIVING STRAIGHT ON A HIGHWAY AT THE TIME AND WAS ABLE TO SAFELY PULL OVER. HAD THIS HAPPENED ON A CORNER, WITH TRACTION LOST ON THE REAR TIRE THE RESULTS COULD HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT.",
