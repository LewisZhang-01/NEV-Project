THE FUEL GAUGE WAS SHOWING I HAD 1/4 OF A TANK LEFT AS THE CAR SHUTDOWN RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BUSY HIGHWAY NO WARNING LIGHTS AT 3AM , VERY CLOSE CALL ON A ACCIDENT ALMOST COST ME MY LIFE AND THE COP WHO WAS HELPING ME. WE COULD NOT PUSH MY SUV OFF TO THE SIDE. SO I TOOK THE SUV TO CAMPBELLNELSON NISSAN OF EDMONDS, I WAS TOLD THERE'S NO RECALL ON MY SUV VIN SPECIFIC. I WAS TOLD THERE'S A RECALL 2005-2009 BUT ON NOT ON MY VIN #. THEY CALLED ME AND SAID THE FUEL SENDING UNIT WAS BAD AND WAS NOT READING IT SHOWS 1/4 OF A TANK BUT IT WAS OUT OF GAS. SO WAY IS MY 2005 NISSAN ARMADA NOT ON THE RECALL LIST WHAT'S IT GOING TO TAKE SOMEONE TO GET KILLED!
