THIS VEHICLE HAS HAD THREE FAILUERS OF THE WATER PUMP AT A COST TO REPAIRE OF $500.00 EACH TIME TO REPAIRE. I HAVE ALSO HAD THE FRONT SUSPENSION FAIL, WHICH COST $1185.00 TO REPAIRE. THIS VEHICLE IS NOT DRIVEN HARD, MILEAGE WILL SHOW MAYBE 10,000 MILES PER YEAR. I FEEL BY THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ON YOUR SYSTEM THAT THE MANUFACTURE HAS HAD MORE THAN NORMAL NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FOR BOTH THESE PROBLEMS. I THINK A RECALL IS CALLED FOR, AND SOME SORT OF REMIBRUSMENT FOR THE COST OF REPAIRES MADE. ALL MY REPAIRES WHERE DONE BY A GOODYEAR FACILITY OR DEALERSHIP.",
