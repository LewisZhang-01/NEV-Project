OUR '97 GRAND MARQUIS INTAKE MANIFOLD CRACKED, WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY AND WE (FORTUNATELY) HAD JUST RETURNED FROM A BACK ROADS AREA.  WE HAD TO GET TOWED TO A FORD DEALERSHIP WHERE FOR $700 THEY REPLACED THE 'COMPOSITE' PLASTIC MANIFOLD.      I ALSO HAVE A 2001 G.MARQUIS, IF IT'S COVERED BY THE RUMORED FORTH COMING RECALL.            *JB",
