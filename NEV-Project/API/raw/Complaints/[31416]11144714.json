CALLED HONDA - CREATED A CASE AND TOOK CAR TO DEALER FOR A CHECKUP.  THEY DID A COMPLIMENTARY OIL CHANGE,  SAID THE DISPSTICK SMELLED LIKE EXHAUST AND TOLD ME THERE SHOULD BE A FIX IN NOVEMBER PER HONDA.  JUST READ ABOUT THE PROPOSED FIX AND FOUND THAT THEY ARE ONLY DOING THIS IN COLD WEATHER STATES.   I HAVE HGAD MY CAR FOR 9 MONTHS AND HAVE LESS THAN 5000 MILES ON IT.  I ONLY USE IT FOR SHORT TRIPS WHICH IS WHY I BELIEVE I MAY HAVE THIS ISSUE.  CALLED HONDA AGAIN TODAY TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO ABOUT  PEOPLE WITH THIS ISSUE IN TEXAS AND WAS TOLD THAT IT IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.   THINKING THEY NEED A PUSH TO DO THE RIGHT THING HERE (PERHAPS AN OFFICIAL RECALL)?",
