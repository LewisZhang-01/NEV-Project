IT SEEMS THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH VW.  I'M PICKING MY CAR UP TOMORROW AFTER THE REPLACEMENT OF THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION VALVE BODY.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED WITH SO MANY COMPLAINTS INCLUDING A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT THE VW AGREED TO EXTEND THE WARRANTY TO REPLACE THE VALVE BODY.  HOWEVER, I WAS TOLD BY MY DEALER THAT MY VIN WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE EXTENDED WARRANTY AND IT WOULD COST $1800 TO REPLACE.  THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM WITH THIS COMPONENT AND VW NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THESE REPAIRS.",
