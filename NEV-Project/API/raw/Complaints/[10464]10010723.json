THE ONLY TEMPORARY FIX IS TO TURN THE ENGINE OFF AND RESTART THE VEHICLE.  MY SPOUSE WAS NEARLY REAR ENDED BY A HAY TRUCK WHILE TRYING TO GET ONTO THE HIGHWAY.  THE VEHICLE HAS HAD THREE COMPUTER PROGRAM UPDATES - NONE OF WHICH HAS FIXED THE PROBLEM.  FORD HAS NOW TOLD THE FLEET SERVICE DEPARTMENT THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FIX IT.  FORD DOES NOT HAVE AN \"UPDATE\" TO FIX THIS PROBLEM AND TOLD THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO RETURN THE VEHICLE TO US TO DRIVE UNTIL THEY COME UP WITH A SOLUTION.  *NLM",
