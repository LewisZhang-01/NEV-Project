IF ONCOMING TRAFFIC, COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUS INJURIES OR FATALITY.  DUE TO THE STRONG AND VARIABLE [HARD TO PREDICT OR CONTROL] BRAKING ACTION OF THE HYBRID'S CHARGING SYSTEM, THIS CAR SHOULD HAVE A SKID SENSOR ACTIVATING SOME KIND OF TRACTION CONTROL, INCLUDING INTERRUPTION OF THE CHARGING FUNCTION AS SOON AS A SKID IS DETECTED.  I THINK THIS SHOULD BE ORDERED TO BE RETROFITTED TO ALL THE HYBRIDS.  *JB",
