UPON EXTENSIVE ONLINE RESEARCH THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH THE CARAVAN FROM 1998 THROUGH 2004 WITH RECALLS.  WHEN LOOKING ONLINE I'VE READ MANY COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE STILL HAVING THIS PROBLEM WITH THE 2005.  IT SEEMS THAT THIS PROBLEM IS STILL NOT FIXED.  I HOPE THAT YOU WILL LOOK INTO THIS.  I'M NOW SCARED TO DRIVE MY VEHICLE, AFRAID THAT IT WILL DIE GOING DOWN THE HIGHWAY CAUSING AN ACCIDENT OR CATCH FIRE.  *TR",
