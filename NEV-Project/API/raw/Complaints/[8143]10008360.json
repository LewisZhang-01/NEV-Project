THERE IS A SEPARATION AROUND THE ENTIRE INTERIOR SIDEWALL, THE SHOP DOING THE WORK (A TIRE DEALER) TIPPED ME OFF BY SAYING. I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD REPLACE THE FIRESTONE, WHICH WERE GENERALLY OKAY, WITH A TIRE KNOWN TO HAVE PROBLEMS.  A LITTLE WEB RESEARCH YIELDED THE FOLLOWING REPORT:    HTTP://WWW.STRATEGICSAFETY.COM/LIBRARY/SI004.HTM    MY 17 YEAR OLD SON DRIVES THIS CAR.  I'M SHOCKED AND LOOKING FOR RE-COURSE.  HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE FIRESTONE TIRES WERE REPLACED BY A TIRE KNOWN TO HAVE THE EXACT SAME ISSUES?  *JB    I NEED SOME RECOURSE HERE!",
