THE VEHICLES ENGINE SHUTOFF WHILE I WAS DRIVING WITH MY 4 YEAR OLD SON IN THE CAR, THANKFULLY AT A SLOW SPEED IN A SHOPPING PLAZA PARKING LOT. THE DASH LIGHTS WORK, BUT THE ENGINE WILL NOT START. I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A SHOP WHO FOUND THE STARTER HAD BEEN FRIED AND REPLACED IT THINKING IT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM, BUT THE NEW STARTER WAS FRIED AS WELL AND UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION THEY REALIZED THE ENGINE HAS COMPLETELY SEIZED. KIA WHILE HAVING RECALLS FOR THE SAME ISSUE ON OTHER KIA OPTIMA VEHICLES WILL NOT REPLACE MY ENGINE, LEAVING ME WITH A FINANCIAL MESS. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED AN INVOICE FROM THE SHOP AS OF YET DUE TO THE VEHICLE NOT BEING DRIVABLE AND MY ATTEMPTS TO FIND A WAY TO FUND THE REPAIRS, BUT WILL RETAIN THE INVOICE ONCE RECEIVED.",
