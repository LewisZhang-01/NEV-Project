        "summary": "MY DAUGHTER AND I WERE DRIVING ALONG A BUSY STREET WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO SLOW DOWN BECAUSE THE TRAFFIC AHEAD STARTED SLOWING DOWN FOR A RED LIGHT AND MY CAR DIDN'T RESPOND TO MY BRAKING.  I WAS DRIVING BEHIND A BUS AND MY CAR KEPT ACCELERATING TOWARDS THE BUS.  I THREW THE CAR IN PARK - STRIPPING THE GEARS - AND THE CAR KEPT GOING.  BY SOME LARGE MIRACLE, THERE WAS A GAP IN THE TRAFFIC COMING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION, SO I TURNED INTO THOSE LANES AND TRAVELED FOR A FEW FEET BEFORE I CAME UPON A ONE WAY STREET - NOT IN MY FAVOR - IT'S ANOTHER MIRACLE NO ONE WAS COMING UP THAT STREET, SO I TURNED INTO THE ONE WAY HOPING TO FIND SOME WAY TO STOP THE CAR.  THE TWISTS AND TURNS TOOK AWAY SOME OF THE MOMENTUM AND WHEN I HAD GONE ABOUT 1/3 OF THE WAY DOWN THE ONE WAY STREET, I YANKED UP THE EMERGENCY BRAKE AND THE CAR FINALLY STOPPED.  THE CAR WAS TOWED INTO THE DEALERSHIP ON TUESDAY, MAY 6, 2003 AND THEY CALLED ME ON WEDNESDAY, MAY 7TH, TO SAY THAT THEY RAN ALL SORTS OF CHECKS AND FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE BRAKES.  THE FACT THAT THE BRAKES ARE NOW WORKING DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE BRAKES ARE GOOD.  MY DAUGHTER AND I CAN TESTIFY TO THAT FACT BECAUSE WE WERE THE ONES WHO FACED THAT NEAR DEATH SITUATION AND I REFUSE TO TAKE A CHANCE WITH OUR LIVES.  THERE IS A DEFECT IN THE BRAKES AND I WOULD HATE TO START SEEING REPORTS OF FATALITIES CAUSED BY THIS BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY DID NOT DO EXTENSIVE ENOUGH TESTS TO FIND AND FIX THE PROBLEM.  THE DEALER IS BASICALLY SAYING THAT SINCE THEY CAN'T FIND A PROBLEM, I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT THE TAKE THE CAR BACK.  I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT DRIVE THAT CAR THE WAY IT IS BECAUSE I CONSTANTLY VISUALIZE THE OUTCOME HAD I BEEN TRAVELING ON A HIGHWAY GOING 50 OR 60 MILES AN HOUR.  AS IT IS, WE ARE VERY LUCKY AND THANKFUL THAT EVERYTHING WORKED IN OUR FAVOR AND WE DID NOT CRASH.  I DON'T WANT TO BECOME A STATISTIC AT WHICH TIME THEY WILL BREAK THEIR NECKS TO FIND AND FIX THE PROBLEM....TOO LATE.  *NLM",
