DEALER DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM TO BE BAD UPPER AND LOWER BALL JOINTS AND BAD DRAG LINK. I DO NOT TOW OR PLOW WITH THIS VEHICLE  HAVE HAD IT SERVICED  AT DEALERSHIPS FOR MOST OF ITS SERVICE LIFE DON'T THINK THAT THE TRUCK SHOULD HAVE BAD BALL JOINT  THIS YOUNG IN ITS SERVICE LIFE. THE WANDER MAKES THE TRUCK TRICKY TO DRIVE IN WINTER CONDITIONS WHEN YOU HAVE TO STAY IN THE TIRE TRACKS ON SNOW COVERED ROADS . YOU CANT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD FOR A SECOND  THE TRUCK STARTS TO WANDER NOT THAT YOUR SUPPOSED TO TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD. AS FOR THE BRAKE PULSATION HAD THE ROTORS TURNED @ 34000 MILES BECAUSE OF THE SAME PROBLEM IT CAME   BACK AT ABOUT 38000 MILES ON A LONG TRIP NOW  NO TOWING AND NO UNUSUAL  HARD BRAKING. THE PULSATION  MAKES THE TRUCK  HARD  TO STEER DURING MODERATE BRAKING EVENTS.       *JB",
