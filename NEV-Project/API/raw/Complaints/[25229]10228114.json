TIRE DEALERSHIP REPLACED TIRE AT AROUND 6000 MILES,  WHEN GOING IN TO HONDA DEALERSHIP FOR MAINTENANCE (ROTATION TIRES, OIL CHANGE) THE SHOP FOREMAN INFORMED ME THAT THE TIRE WAS BAD BECAUSE MY CAR WAS NOW PULLING.  WHEN STATING PULLING, IT WAS A MAJOR PULL, NOT SLIGHT PULL.  I TOOK CAR BACK TO TIRE DEALERSHIP AND THEY REFUSED TO EVEN DRIVE MY CAR, SAID IT WAS NORMAL TO HAVE IT PULL.  TOOK CAR TO ANOTHER TIRE DEALERSHIP AND THEY REPLACED TIRE.  UPON GOING TO DEALERSHIP AGAIN FOR MAINTENANCE, THE NEW TIRE WAS ROTATED TO FRONT OF CAR AGAIN AND IT WAS PULLING AGAIN.  SHOP FOREMAN INSIST IT IS THE TIRE.  I BRING CAR BACK TO TIRE DEALERSHIP AT WHICH TIME HE REALIZES THAT THE TIRE IS NOT THE RIGHT TIRE.  ORDERS THE CORRECT TIRE AND INSTALLED IT AND THE CAR STILL PULLS.  NOW THIS IS NOT REPEAT NOT A SLIGHT PULL, BUT A MAJOR PULL.  IF I DO NOT HOLD THE STEERING WHEEL TO THE RIGHT I WOULD BE IN THE DITCH OR OTHER LANE UPON TAKING OFF.  THE PULL IS REALLY A HARD PULL.  I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR BACK TO DEALERSHIP, BECAUSE TIRE DEALERSHIP SAYS ITS THE CAR, CAR DEALERSHIP SAYS ITS THE TIRE?  CAN SOMEONE HELP?  PLEASE  *TR",
