THERE WERE LESS THAN 60,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE AT THAT TIME - NOW THERE ARE 140,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE WITH A REBUILT (GM WARRANTY) TRANSMISSION.  I ALSO HAD A 1997 BUICK (GM CAR) THAT HAD WARRANTY WORK TO REPLACE/REPAIR THE TRANSMISSION (TWICE) AND A COMPLETE FAILURE OF THE TRANSMISSION THAT REQUIRED REPLACEMENT OF THE TRANSMISSION (WHICH WAS LESS THAN 200 MILES OUTSIDE THE WARRANTY BUT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY).  MY GRANDMOTHER ALSO HAD A 1997 BUICK WHERE THE TRANSMISSION FAILED WITH LESS THAN 40,000 MILES (BUT OUTSIDE THE 3 YEAR WARRANTY PERIOD).  I WOULD THINK IT UNLIKELY THAT SO MANY 1997 CARS WOULD EXHIBIT TRANSMISSION FAILURES WITH LOW MILEAGE UNLESS THERE WAS A SPECIFIC MANUFACTURING PROBLEM WITH 1997 GM TRANSMISSIONS.   *NLM",
