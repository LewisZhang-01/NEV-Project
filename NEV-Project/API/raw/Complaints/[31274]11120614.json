AIRBAG LIGHT WAS TRIGGERED (STAYS FLASHING AFTER VEHICLE HAS BEEN STARTED STATIONARY & IN MOTION) & CODE B1032 CAME UP AT NISSAN DEALER. I WAS INFORMED THAT MY VIN WASN'T INCLUDED IN RECALL, DESPITE IT BEING SAME TRIGGER, YEAR, MAKE & MODEL RECALLED. I REQUESTED INFO ON HOW CLOSE IN MANUFACTURING TO THE RECALLED VEHICLES MINE IS & WAS INFORMED THAT INFO ISN'T KNOWN. THAT INFO IS TRACKED SOMEWHERE & THAT'S HOW RECALLS ARE ISSUED. TO GET THIS REPAIRED WOULD COST ME OVER $2.500 (PER ESTIMATE ON RECORD). HOW DO I GET THIS INVESTIGATED SO MINE CAN BE INCLUDED AS IT IS THE SAME YEAR, MAKE, MODEL & ISSUE INVOLVED IN RECALL?",
