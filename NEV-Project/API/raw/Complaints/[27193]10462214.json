        "summary": "WE WERE DRIVING UP I-95 FROM FL TO VA WHEN THE CAR SUDDENLY GAVE A LOUD WARNING TONE AND DISPLAYED THE MESSAGE STOP SAFELY NOW.  THE CAR LOST ALL POWER AS WE QUICKLY TRIED TO CROSS SEVERAL LANES OF TRAFFIC TO REACH THE SHOULDER.  UPON EXAMINATION OF THE CAR WE STARTED IT UP AGAIN WITH NO CONSEQUENCE AND CONTINUED ON OUR TRIP.  ABOUT 30 MINUTES LATER IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  AFTER READING THE OWNER'S MANUAL I DISCOVERED THE WARNING MESSAGE INVOLVED A COMPONENT OF THE HYBRID SYSTEM. I DECIDED TO TRY SHUTTING OFF THE ECON SWITCH (WHICH ACTIVATES BATTERY) AND ALL AC/ ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS.  THIS WORKED BEAUTIFULLY FOR 100+ MILES UNTIL AT NIGHTFALL THE HEADLIGHTS KICKED ON AND OUR TROUBLES RETURNED.  SINCE IT WAS SUNDAY NIGHT WE DECIDED TO STAY OVERNIGHT WHERE WE WERE AND GET IT CHECKED BY THE NEAREST FORD IN THE MORNING. THE DIAGNOSTICS ($95) REVEALED IT WAS THE MOTOR ELECTRONIC COOLING PUMP AT FAULT WHICH THIS DEALER DID NOT CARRY.  WE CAUTIOUSLY CONTINUED USING THE NO ELECTRICAL METHOD AND WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY REACH OUR DESTINATION 400MILES AWAY WITH NO MORE INCIDENTS, WHERE WE THEN TOOK IT TO OUR HOME DEALER FOR REPAIR.  A VERY DANGEROUS CONDITION WHICH UPON RESEARCH I'M LEARNING IS HAPPENING TO MANY OTHER ESCAPE HYBRID OWNERS.      *JS",
