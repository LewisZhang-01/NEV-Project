THIS WAS A BRAKE LAMP MALFUNCTION WHICH COULD ALSO AFFECT THE ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL AND TRACTION CONTROL (DISABLING THEM).  ALSO POSSIBLE PROBLEMS WERE BRAKE LIGHTS COMING ON WHEN ACCELERATING AND GOING OFF WHEN BRAKING.  THIS ALSO AFFECTS THE CRUISE CONTROL AND THE SHIFTER.  HAD THE RECALL WORK DONE TODAY, OCTOBER 3, 2014.  BY THE TIME I GOT HOME, BRAKE LIGHTS WERE CONTINUOUSLY ON, CRUISE CONTROL DID NOT WORK, AND TRACTION CONTROL AND ESC WERE DISABLED.   THIS AFTER GM'S RECALL.  *TR",
