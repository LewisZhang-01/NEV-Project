CHEVROLET SERVICER JOKED THAT WHEN THEY SEE ONE COME IN THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO LOOK AT THE VEHICLE TO DIAGNOSE IT BECAUSE IT IS SO COMMON.  HE EVEN STATED THAT WITH THE COST OF THE REPAIR THAT IT APPEARS THAT CHEVROLET DISCOVERED A WAY TO INCREASE NEW VEHICLE SALES.  THEN HE SAID MAYBE I SHOULD TALK TO A SALESMAN WHILE THEY MAKE THE REPAIR.  THIS IS DANGEROUS AND CERTAINLY IS NO JOKING MATTER.  RESEARCHED AND IT IS VERY OBVIOUS THAT THIS IS NOT JUST AN OCCASIONAL PROBLEM.  CONSIDERING A VEHICLE COSTS $30K & THE DANGER I THINK CHEVROLET SHOULD DO A RECALL.*AK",
