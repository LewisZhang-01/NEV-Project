IN FACT, THAT PREVIOUS GENERATION NISSANS WERE ACTUALLY RECALLED FOR A SIMILAR ISSUE.  UNFORTUNATELY, NO RECALL HAS BEEN PLACED ON THE PART FOR THE 2ND GEN YET, AND SO NISSAN CUSTOMERS ARE BEING FORCED TO HAVE THE DEALER MAKE THE REPAIR TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT $600 SEEMS OUTRAGEOUS......... THEY SHOULD RECALL IT. *TR",
