        "summary": "THE THROTTLE IN MY 2007 RAV4 V6 LIMITED HAS STUCK OPEN THREE TIMES IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS.  IT HAPPENS AFTER I \"FLOOR\" THE ACCELERATOR.  THE FIRST TIME OCCURRED IN MY GARAGE AS I WAS TRYING TO START THE ENGINE.  I HAD TO TURN IT OFF.  THE SECOND TIME WAS A WEEK LATER AS I WAS PASSING A TRUCK GOING UP A HILL ON A 3 LANE HIGHWAY.  I PUT ON THE BRAKES AND TRIED TO GET THE TRANSMISSION INTO NEUTRAL AS I TRIED TO GET TO CROSS TWO LANES OF TRAFFIC TO GET TO THE SHOULDER.  I WAS SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT GETTING INTO AN ACCIDENT, BUT IT WAS SCARY.  I TOOK THE CAR TO A DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT THE THROTTLE BODY HAD A LEAK, SO THEY REPLACED THE SEAL.  I DID NOT EXPERIENCE THE PROBLEM AGAIN FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS UNTIL IT HAPPENED AGAIN TWO DAYS AGO.  I WAS ACCELERATING TO MERGE WITH TRAFFIC ON A FREEWAY.  I APPLIED THE BRAKES AND THE THROTTLE STOPPED STICKING AND QUICKLY RETURNED TO NORMAL OPERATION. *TR",
