I HAVE MADE REPORTS TO THE COMPANY EACH TIME A NEW CHIP HAS OCCURRED (THE CHIPS AND HUNKS ARE DOWN TO THE BARE METAL)  THE COMPANY HAD A REP COME IN TO LOOK AT MY CAR AND THEY CONTINUE TO KEEP SAYING IT IS ROAD DAMGE WHEN IN FACT IT IS NOT.  THEY HAVE OFFERED NO HELP, OPTIONS OR SOLUTIONS TO MY PROBLEM.  ALL I WANT THE CAR TO BE ANALYZED TO SEE WHAT IS CAUSING THE PAINT TO COME OFF.  IT COULD BE BAD PAINT, OR THAT THE CARS METAL WAS NOT PREPPED AND TREATED PROPERLY BEFORE PAINTING OR IT COULD EVEN BE THE PRIMER ITSELF.  I JUST WANT A SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM, THIS IS THE FIRST NEW CAR I HAVE PURCHASED AND IT WAS AN EXPENSIVE CAR.  I HAVE OWNED MUCH OLDER CARS IN THE PAST WHERE I HAVE NEVER HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE PAINT ON THEM.",
