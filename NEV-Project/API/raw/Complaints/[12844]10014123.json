WE CANNOT LOCATE A LEAK - HAVE CHANGED THE FUEL FILTER, DISTRIBUTOR CAP & OXYGEN SENSOR BUT WHEN IT RAINS OR IS HUMID THE CARS STALLS UNTIL IT GETS WARM (AFTER RUNNING FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES).  THIS HAPPENS WHEN YOU PRESS THE GAS PEDAL EVEN SLIGHTLY.  NO ONE CAN LOCATE THE PROBLEM - SOMEONE I WORK WITH HAD ONE THAT DID THE SAME THING UNTIL THEY SOLD IT.  YOU CAN PAD THE PEDAL AND SOMETIMES GET PAST THE POINT OF STALLING.   *NLM",
