THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WAS THE COOLING PIPE WAS RUBBING AGAINST THE POWER STEERING LINE (ACCORDING TO THE SERVICE ADVISOR) AND THE COOLING PIPE WORE OUT.  I ASKED IF IT WAS A DESIGN FLAW.  HE REPLIED THAT HE NEVER SAW THIS BEFORE, BUT THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING BETWEEN THE COOLING PIPE AND THE POWER STEERING LINE TO PREVENT THE RUBBING.  THIS FIX IS $410 FOR PARTS AND LABOR AND IS NOT COVER UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY SINCE IT IS A PIPE THAT BROKE.    I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW BY TOYOTA.  *NLM",
