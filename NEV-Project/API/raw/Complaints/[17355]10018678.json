TOYOTA HAS BEEN AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND HAS REDESIGNED BRAKES FOR THE VEHICLE AND RELEASED SEVERAL SERVICE BULLETINS ON THE MATTER.  BUT NOW I AN 4 MONTHS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THEY ARE CHARGING 1500 DOLLARS  FOR A REPAIR THAT SHOULD BE A RECALL.  THE VIBRATION IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED.  A VEHICLE THIS NEW SHOULD NOT HAVE ROUTINE BRAKE PROBLEMS EVERY 30,000 MILES.  THE ARE QUITE A FEW UNHAPPY TUNDRA OWNERS SHOWING UP ON THE NET.  *NLM",
