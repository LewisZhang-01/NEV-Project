        "summary": "I PUT A PRODUCT CALLED TIREFLYS ON THE VALVE STEM OF MY 1999 HARLEY DAVIDSON ELECTRA GLIDE CLASSIC.  THESE CADGETS GIVE OFF LIGHT AS THE WHEEL SPINS.  AFTER 15 MINUTES OF RIDING ON I 75 I DEVELOPED TWO FLAT TIRES AT THE SAME TIME.  IT SEEMS THAT THE TIREFLYS REMOVE THE STEM FROM THE TIRE.  I CRASHED MY BIKE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE INTERSTATE- LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO HOLD THE BIKE UP UNTIL IT WAS ONLY GOING ABOUT 5 TO 10 MPH. THE BIKE SUSTAINED $7500.00 IN DAMAGE.  I WAS OK, LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO PLANT THE ACCIDENT ENOUGH TO MINIMIZE THE DAMAGE TO ME.  I CANT BELIEVE THAT A $20.00 PRODUCT CAN WREAK SO MUCH HAVOC!    ROSSITER'S HARLEY DAVIDSON DEALER IN SARASOTA STOPPED SELLING THEM MORE THAN A YEAR AGO. THEY TOO HAD PROBLEMS WITH THEM AS CUSTOMERS APPEARED WITH FLAT TIRES SOON AFTER HAVING THEM PLACED ON THE BIKE.   *NLM",
