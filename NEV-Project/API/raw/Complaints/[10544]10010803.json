        "summary": "I TOOK MY CAR TO HAVE THE OIL CHANGED AND IN THE PROCESS THE OIL DIPSTICK HANDLE BROKE.  WHEN I NOTIFIED NISSAN, I WAS INFORMED BY A SERVICE TECHNICIAN THAT THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE WITH NISSANS.    WE TRIED TO RETRIEVE THE OIL DIPSTICK BUT TO NO AVAIL.  SO I CALLED NISSAN AND SPOKE WITH A SERVICE TECHNICIAN AND HE INFORMED ME, THE OIL PAN WOULD HAVE TO BE DROPPED AND  \"ONLY\" A NISSAN SERVICE TECHNICIAN COULD PERFORM THE JOB.  THE NISSAN SERVICE TECHNICIAN INFORMED ME THAT  IT WOULD COST $200.00 TO REPAIR.    THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN ALSO INFORMED ME DURING OUR CONSERVATION, T THEY WERE DROPPING THE OIL PAN ON SEVERAL NISSAN'S WITH THE SAME PROBLEM , A BROKEN OIL DIPSTICK.   I THINK IT IS UNFAIR FOR THE CONSUMER TO PAY $200.00 TO HAVE AN OIL DIPSTICK REMOVED WHEN THE MATERIAL OR PART IS SUBSTANDARD INITIALLY.    BASICALLY WHAT NISSAN IS SAYING IS, WHEN I GET AN OIL CHANGE THERE IS A \"GREAT\" POSSIBILITY THE OIL DIPSTICK WILL BREAK.  *JB",
