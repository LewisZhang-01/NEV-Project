IT IS A RADIAL SPOKED WHEEL AND THERE WAS NOT ONE SPOKE CONNECTED BETWEEN THE HUB AND THE RIM.  THEY ALL CAME OUT WHILE I WAS RIDING.  I THOUGHT I WAS EXPERIENCING A FLAT TIRE AS THE REAR OF THE BIKE BEGAN TO WOBBLE, I STARTED TO SLOW DOWN AND THE REAR OF THE MOTORCYCLE JUST DROPPED DOWN ON THE PAVEMENT DUE TO ALL THE SPOKES COMING OUT OF THE HUB AND RIM.  I DO HAVE PICTURES OF THE WHEEL THAT FELL APART.   *JB",
