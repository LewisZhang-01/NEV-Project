        "summary": "ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, THE VEHICLE HAS STALLED AT SPEED.  FOUR OUT THE FIVE TIMES IT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR, IT STARTED BACK ON ITS OWN.  ONE OF THE STALLS REQUIRED STOPPING AND RESTARTING THE VEHICLE.  EACH STALL HAS OCCURRED RANDOMLY, TWICE WITH CRUISE CONTROL ON, ONCE WHILE ACCELERATING, ONCE WHILE BRAKING AND ONCE WHILE DRIVING STEADY WITHOUT CRUISE.  TWO TIMES IT STALLED ON THE HIGHWAY AT SPEEDS BETWEEN 65 TO 75 MPH, TWO OF THE TIMES IT STALLED ON AN ON OR OFF RAMP TO THE HIGHWAY BETWEEN 35 TO 45 MPH, AND ONCE IN A PARKING LOT AT ABOUT 15 MPH.  EACH TIME IT HAS STALLED, THE ENGINE SHUTS OFF, ALL ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT SHUTS OFF COMPLETELY (RADIO, A/C, LIGHTS)  AND THE GAUGES DROP TO ZERO LIKE THE VEHICLE IS OFF.  ALL BUT ONE OF THESE TIME, THE VEHICLE THEN STARTS RIGHT BACK UP WITHIN ABOUT 1 TO 3 SECONDS, THE GAUGES RETURN TO NORMAL, RADIO TURNS BACK ON, ETC.  EACH TIME THE VEHICLE STALLED LIKE THIS, THE TRANSMISSION WAS FULLY IN GEAR (NO CLUTCH BEING USED AT THE TIME).  I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE IN THREE TIMES FOR REPAIR.  THE FIRST TIMES WERE SUPPOSEDLY TO UPDATE THE VEHICLES COMPUTER SYSTEM.  THE THIRD TIME, I DON'T KNOW IF ANYTHING WAS DONE OR NOT, BUT DEALER TOLD ME THAT NEITHER THEY, NOR CHRYSLER CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT AND WILL NOT FIX IT AT THIS TIME.  OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS VERY MUCH A SAFETY CONCERN AND HOPE FOR THIS TO BE RESOLVED SOON.   *TR",
