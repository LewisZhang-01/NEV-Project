        "summary": "I HAD PURCHASED 2002 VW PASSATT IN JUNE 2002 (4 CYLINDER). DURING THE PAST 6 MONTH I HAD TO CHANGE ALL FOUR COILS WHICH MEANS MY CAR WAS OUT FOR REPAIRS EVERY 6 WEEKS DURING THE 6 MONTH TIME SPAN. APPEARANTLY VOLKSWAGEN PASSATTS ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR BAD COILS. ABOUT 90% OF CARS HAVE THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM! THERE SHOULD BE A TOTAL RECALL!! THE DEALRSHIPS ARE SENDING CUSTOMERS BACK ON TO THE ROAD WITH A POTENTIALLY SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS PROBLEMS. I HAVE A CHILD AND I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE IN THE CAR WITH MY CHILD IN IT. I'M AFRAID TO LEAVE TOWN, TO DRIVE ON A HIGHWAY OR AT NIGHT. THE CAR IS MECHANICALLY UNRELIABLE. I HAVE PURCHASED A PRODUCT THAT I CAN'T USE WITHOUT RISK. CUSTOMERS ARE NOT INFORMED ABOUT THE COIL PROBLEM WHEN THEY PURCHASE THESE VEHICLES. PEOPLE ARE BEING SCAMMED! AND VW MANUFACTURERS ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THE PROBLEM! A 6 MO OLD CAR SHOULD NOT BE IN A REPAIR SHOP EVERY 6 WEEKS FOR THE SAME PROBLEM!I DON'T FEEL SAFE IN THIS CAR! PASSATT IS A TIME BOMB!",
