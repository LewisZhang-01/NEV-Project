I HAVE GONE THROUGH 4 BATTERIES IN A YEAR, HAVE REPLACE THE ALTERNATOR AND I STILL HAVE PROBLEMS.  NOT ONE SHOP, ALONG WITH A DEALER, CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THIS CAR WILL NOT RUN PROPERLY.  THE DEALER WHO SOLD ME THE CAR TOLD ME IT WAS TOO LATE FOR HIM TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  I ALSO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AS EVERYONE ELSE WITH THE SEAT BELT, DRIVERS SIDE.  IT NO LONGER CONNECTS TOGETHER.  DEALER WHO SOLD ME CAR STATED THE CAR WAS A 6 CYLINDER AS DOES MY TITLE, FOUND OUT RECENTLY THAT CAR IS ONLY 4 CYLINDER.  *NLM",
