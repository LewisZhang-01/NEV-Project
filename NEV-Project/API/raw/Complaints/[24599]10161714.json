IT IS COMPLETELY UNRELIABLE, AND I HAVE TO RESET THE TRIP METER EACH TIME I FILL THE VEHICLE UP WITH GAS. I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A FLUKE UNTIL MY WIFE HEARD A WORK COLLEAGUE ON THE TELEPHONE WITH ISUZU COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE WITH HER RODEO AS WELL (DIFFERENT MODEL YEAR).  NOW I SEE IN REVIEWING THIS WEBSITE, THAT THIS IS MORE THAN A COINCIDENCE.  IN ADDITION, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS CONSTANTLY ON AND OFF ON THE VEHICLE.  I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS DUE TO THE ISSUE WITH THE GAS GAGE AS WELL.  ACCORDING TO MY MECHANIC, IT COSTS ABOUT $500 TO REPAIR THIS PR PROBLEM AS THE LABOR INVOLVED IS QUITE EXTENSIVE.  *NM",
