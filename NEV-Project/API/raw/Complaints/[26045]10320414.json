        "summary": "WE BOUGHT A USED 2002 TOYOTA TUNDRA ON 6-16-2005 THAT HAD 45,134 MILES ON IT. IT NOW HAS 109,000 MILES ON IT . WHEN WE FIRST BOUGHT THE TRUCK FROM THE DEALERSHIP, THE BRAKES WERE REPLACED BEFORE WE TOOK IT HOME BECAUSE WE NOTICED A VIBRATION. SINCE THEN, WE HAVE REPLACED THE BRAKES, PADS, ETC. TWICE. WE NOW HAVE TO HAVE THE VEHICLE SERVICE AGAIN BECAUSE WHILE DRIVING THE TRUCK SHAKES VIOLENTLY AT AROUND 40 MPH AND BRAKING LITERALLY SHAKES THE ENTIRE TRUCK. IT SEEMS HIGHLY UNREASONABLE TO HAVE TO REPLACE THE BRAKING SYSTEM 4 TIMES IN THREE YEARS OF OWNERSHIP. I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS DEFECT IN THE BRAKING SYSTEM IN THE 2002 TOYOTA TUNDRA THAT COULD LEAD TO ACCIDENTS CAUSING INJURY OR DEATH. WHEN WILL TOYOTA RECALL THESE VEHICLES DUE TO MANUFACTURING DEFECTS IN THEIR BRAKING SYSTEM? I AM STARTING THE INCIDENT DATE AS OF THE DATE OF PURCHASE SINCE THAT IS WHEN WE FIRST HAD THE BRAKES REPLACED. I NOW HAVE TO PAY MORE MONEY TO HAVE THE ENTIRE TRUCK BRAKING SYSTEM CORRECTED AGAIN SO THAT WE DO NOT END UP IN HARMS WAY. TOYOTA NEEDS TO STEP UP AND REVIEW ALL THE COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE BEEN FILED ABOUT THIS COMPLAIN. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE BRAKING SYSTEM IN THIS VEHICLE. *TR",
