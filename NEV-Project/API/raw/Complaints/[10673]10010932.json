IT NOW HAS 37,000 MILES ON IT AND DURING THOSE 37,000 MILES I HAVE HAD TO HAVE THE ROTORS TURNED TWICE AND HAVE THE BRAKES PADS REPLACED THREE TIME SINCE JUNE OF 2001.  I AM NOT A HARD DRIVER NOR DO I DRIVE RECKLESSLY.  IN MY OPINION, THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR A BRAND NEW CAR.  I ALSO KNOW SOMEONE WHO OWNS A 2001 MONTERO SPORT ES WHO HAS ALSO HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS.  WONDERING IF THERE WAS ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE.  OR IF THIS IS NORMAL FOR A MITSUBISHI PRODUCT BECAUSE IF IT IS, I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.  *JB",
