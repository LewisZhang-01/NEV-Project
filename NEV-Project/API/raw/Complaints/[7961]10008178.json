I HAD A VERY DISTURBING EXPERIENCE  THIS PAST SATURDAY EVENING,  FEBRUARY 15, 2003.  MY WIFE AND  MYSELF WENT OUT FOR DINNER AND THE  RIGHT FRONT TIRE WENT FLAT.  IT WAS  ONLY 15 DEGREES OUT AND I DECIDED  TO CHANGE THE TIRE MYSELF.  I  LOOSENED THE LUG NUTS, THEN USING  THE FACTORY JACK, RAISED THE CAR,  TOOK OFF THE FLAT TIRE, INSTALLED  THE SPARE, AND HAND TIGHTENED ALL  THE LUGS NUTS.  I THEN WENT TO  LOWER THE JACK AND AS I STARTED  TURNING THE BOLT TO LOWER THE CAR,  THE JACK BROKE AND THE CAR FELL.  LUCKILY I WAS NOT UNDER THE TIRE OR  ANY OTHER PART OF THE CAR.  WHEN I  PULLED THE JACK OUT FROM UNDER THE  CAR, THE SIDES OF THE JACK TORE.  IT APPEARS THAT THE JACK WAS MADE  OUT OF MATERIAL ABOUT TWICE THE  THICKNESS OF SHEET METAL.  THE JACK  WAS NOT ROBUST ENOUGH TO HANDLE A  4000 LB. CAR.  I WAS PARKED ON A  LEVEL PARKING LOT WHEN I  CHANGED THE TIRE.  *JB",
