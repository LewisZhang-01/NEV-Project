I REPORTED THIS AS A SAFETY ISSUE TO MY LOCAL NISSAN DEALER AND NATIONAL NISSAN AND THEY FAIL TO CONSIDER IT A SAFETY ISSUE - THEY WANT ME TO PAY $300 TO REPLACE THE VISOR.  THE VISOR IS VERY LARGE, AND WHEN THE VISOR DROPS STRAIGHT DOWN, IT CAN COMPLETELY OBSCURE VISION OUT THE WINDSHIELD.  I AM AFRAID TO CONTINUE DRIVING THIS CAR. *TR",
