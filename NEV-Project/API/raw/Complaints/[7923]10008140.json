THE DEALER DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A FAILED INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET.  THE FAILED GASKET RUINED THE HYDRAULIC LIFTERS AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.  THE TOTAL BILL WAS $1500.   THE VAN HAD REGULAR MAINTENANCE  (OIL, FILTERS, ANITFREEZE CHECKED) EVERY 3000 MILES.  THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH GM VEHICLES AND DEXCOOL SYSTEMS.  THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE HAD THE ENGINE FAILED WHILE DRIVING.*JB",
