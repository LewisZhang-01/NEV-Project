        "summary": "OWN 2002 CHEVY MALIBU. THE SECURITY INTERLOCK KICKS IN FREQUENTLY. I HAVE TO WAIT 10 MINUTES WHILE THE CAR RESETS, ONLY THEN MAY I START THE CAR. (KINDA SIMILAR TO THE FUEL PUMP SHUTTING OFF IF A REAR END BUMP OCCURS-SAFETY). STRANGELY TOO, I HEAR AN ELECTRICAL SIZZLING SOUND JUST OVER AND BEHIND THE RADIO. THIS IS AFFECTING MY TURN SIGNALS FROM WORKING. I HIT THE SAFETY FLASHER BUTTON AND THE SIZZLING NOISE STOPS, AND THE TURN SIGNALS MAY OR MAY NOT OPERATE. SOMEHOW THE RADIO, THE SECURITY SYSTEM, AND THE TURN SIGNALS ARE \"WIRED\" TOGETHER, AND THE CAR THINKS SOMEONE IS STEALING MY RADIO, CAUSING THE SECURITY INTERLOCK TO KICK IN. THAT'S WHEN I HAVE TO TURN THE KEY TO ON, THAN WAIT 10 MINUTES FOR THE SECURITY SYSTEM TO RESET. ONLY AFTER 10 MINUTES MAY I RESTART THE CAR (THIS IS IN THE OWNERS MANUAL). THIS HAPPENS FREQUENTLY. I THINK THERE MAY BE A LINK IN HERE SOMEWHERE THE MY CAR BATTERY IS DRAINING WHILE THE CAR SITS. SOMETHING RELATING TO MY RADIO(SO IT DOESN'T GET STOLEN), AND SECURITY SYSTEM ARE CAUSING THE \"NO START\" INTERLOCK TO KICK IN. *TR",
