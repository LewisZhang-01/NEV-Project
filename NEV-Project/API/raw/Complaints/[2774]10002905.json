        "summary": "MY 2003 SAAB 9-3 WITH 900 MILES HAS BEEN BACK TO THE DEALER TO BE SERVICED ON 3 SEPARATE OCCASIONS FOR COMPUTER MALFUNCTIONS. I HAVE LEASED THIS CAR FOR ABOUT A MONTH. THE DEALER HAS ATTEMPTED REPAIRS BUT HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL. THE COMPUTER PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN A HAZARD WHILE DRIVING THE CAR AND HAVE ALSO BEEN A NUISANCE. THE LOCKING SYSTEM ON THE CAR HAS FAILED TO WORK ON MORE THAN 3 OCCASIONS LEAVING THE CAR UN-LOCKABLE AND IT HAS TRIGGERED THE ALARM SYSTEM ON MANY OCCASIONS. THE DOME LIGHT WILL LIGHT AND STAY ON WHEN I AM DRIVING MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO DRIVE AT NIGHT. THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER COMPUTER MALFUNCTIONS THAT I CAN DISCUSS IN DETAIL IF NEEDED.   THE COMPUTER PROBLEMS MAKE THIS CAR UNPREDICTABLE AND IN MY OPINION DANGEROUS TO DRIVE.",
