THE TIRE WAS ONE OF 4 PURCHASED 9/11/2002, AND HAD ABOUT 10000 MILES ON IT. THE TIRE IS A GOODYEAR INTEGRITY 205/65R15.  THE TIRE TREAD WITH ROAD SURFACE CASING INTACT ENTIRELY SEPARATED FROM THE SIDE WALLS. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF PRIOR DAMAGE SUCH AS NAILS OR CUTS. THE OTHER THREE TIRES WERE EXAMINED BY THE DEALER AND WERE FOUND TO BE PROPERLY INFLATED. THE DEALER REPLACED THE TIRE AT NO CHARGE. MY CONCERN IS WHETHER THESE TIRES ARE SAFE OR NOT. THE DEALER KEPT THE TIRE. PLEASE ADVISE. WE HAVE A HIGH SPEED BLOW OUT WITH NO APPARENT  EXPLANATION. IS THERE A PAST HISTORY?  *JB",
