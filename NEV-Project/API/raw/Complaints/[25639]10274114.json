THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO ANOTHER REPAIR SHOP AND THE MECHANIC NOTICED THAT THE ENGINE WAS ABOUT TO FALL OUT OF THE VEHICLE.  THE FRAME THAT HOLDS THE ENGINE WAS RUSTED OUT.  THE MECHANIC REPLACED THE FRAME AND THE VEHICLE CURRENTLY OPERATES NORMALLY.  THE CONTACT READ IN CONSUMER REPORT THAT THERE WERE RECALLS FOR THE FRAME ON OTHER BUICK MODELS, BUT NOT FOR THE PARK AVENUE.  HE FEELS THAT THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIRS BECAUSE THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.  THE CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 93,530 AND FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 90,669.",
