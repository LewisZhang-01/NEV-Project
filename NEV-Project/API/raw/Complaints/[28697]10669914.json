I HAVE DONE NUMEROUS SEARCHES ON THE INTERNET AND I AM SEEING THIS SAME COMPLAINT OVER AND OVER. I AM VERY CURIOUS WITH IT HAPPENING SO MUCH WHY THIS HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED AND GMC TAKEN CARE OF THIS PROBLEM. I AM EXTREMELY WORRIED ABOUT SAFETY AND THE HIGH COST OF REPAIRING THIS MYSELF, BUT I KNOW IT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF. I'VE OWNED GMC VEHICLES FOREVER AND HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY, UP UNTIL THIS POINT. I THINK THE COMPANY NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, AND QUICKLY.   *TR",
