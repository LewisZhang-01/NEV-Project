I  TOOK IT IN TO FORD TO GET IT REPAIRED IN WHICH I HAVE TO PAY $87.24. THEY SAID THAT THE MILEAGE  HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT.I LOOKED UP SOME RECALLS  ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT THERE IS A RECALL ON THE NAVIGATORS AND THE EXPEDITIONS ON THE 1997-2000 MODELS AND ALSO ON THE 2000 MOUNTAINEERS . WHICH INCLUDES FORD EXPLOYERS F-150,ECT. I FEEL THAT THERE IN NO DIFFERENCE IN THE SEATBELTS ON THESE VEHICLES. SAFETY COMES FIRST. INFACT THE DAY IT HAPPENED I CALLED FORD ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. AND THEY GAVE ME AN APPOINTMENT ONE WEEK LATER. IN WHICH I THINK THAT A SEATBELT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND THEY SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME THAT DAY. PLEASE HELP ME.",
