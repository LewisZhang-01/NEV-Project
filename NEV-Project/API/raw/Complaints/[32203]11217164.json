THE WARRANTY ON THE CAR SHOULD BE A RECALL BECAUSE THE SUBFRAME IS SO RUSTED THAT IT'S DANGEROUS AND TOO UNSAFE TO DRIVE ANYWHERE. IN ADDITION TO THE CAR BEING A SAFETY HAZARD, THE SUBFRAME IS VERY EXPENSIVE TO FIX THANKS TO THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO REMOVE THE SUBFRAME. WITH THE SUBFRAME GONE BAD, THE RUSTED OUT SUBFRAME ALSO DAMAGES ATTACHED PARTS OF THE CAR. THE STRUTS IN THE REAR AND FRONT HAVE GONE BAD DUE TO THE SUBFRAME'S EROSION.",
