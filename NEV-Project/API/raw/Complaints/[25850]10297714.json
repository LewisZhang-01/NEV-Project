NOW WITH APPROX 9800-10,000 MILES A FUEL LEAK HAS DEVELOPED WHEN FUELING THE CAR UP. AT APPROX +1/2-3/4 TANK FUEL SPILLS OUT UNDER THE CAR ON THE DRIVERS SIDE. THIS YEAR SAW AN INSTALLATION OF A NEW  STAINLESS FUEL CROSSOVER LINE BETWEEN THE TANKS. THEY HAVE BEEN NOTORIOUS FOR LEAKAGE ALONG WITH THE DRIVER'S SIDE TANK IN THE AREA WHERE THE CROSSOVER LINE COUPLES TO THE TANK. ALONG WITH WHAT I CONSIDER A MAJOR SAFETY RISK DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF FIRE, (THE EXHAUST AND FUEL TANK ARE IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY) THIS ALSO MUST BE AN EPA/EMISSION VIOLATION FROM ESCAPING FUMES, VAPORS AND FUEL. THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN PAINSTAKINGLY MAINTAINED AND IS IN AS NEW CONDITION (10,000 MILES) THIS IS A DEFECT FROM GM AND DUE TO THE INHERENT POSSIBILITY OF LOSS OF LIFE AND/OR PROPERTY DAMAGE SHOULD BE RECALLED OR AT LEAST REPAIRED BY AN AUTHORIZED GM DEALERSHIP. THIS VEHICLE DOES HAVE A 80,000 MILE EMISSION WARRANTY UNDER WHICH THIS FALLS. *TR",
