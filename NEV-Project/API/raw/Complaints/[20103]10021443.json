THE TAIL GATE POPPED OPEN AND THE RETAINING CABLE ON THE PASSENGER OF THE TAIL GATE BROKE AS A RESULT OF THE TAIL GATE FALLING OPEN. THE TAIL GATE THEN CAME OUT OF ITS RETAINING SOCKET , ON THE PASSENGER SIDE, AND FELL TO THE GROUND. I WAS IN A ROAD CONSTRUCTION ZONE, WITH NO PLACE TO PULL OVER. AFTER ABOUT AN EIGHTH OF A MILE I WAS ABLE TO PULL TO THE SHOULDER. THE TAIL GATE WAS SERIOUSLY DAMAGED. MY COMPLAINT IS ABOUT THE FAILURE OF THE LATCH AND THE FAILURE OF THE RETAINING CABLE.  *JB",
