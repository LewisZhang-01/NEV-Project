I CONSTANTLY DRIVE WITH MY BRIGHT LIGHTS ON AND I STILL CANT EVEN SEE THE LINES ON THE ROAD.  TRY DRIVING WITH YOUR HEADLIGHTS OFF AND THATS HOW THE MARK VIII'S ARE.  THIS IS A BIG SAFTEY ISSUE TOO WHICH FORD SHOULD HAVE RECALLED THIS A LONG TIME AGO.  ITS SICK HOW THEY DONT WANT TO RECALL IT BECAUSE OF THE MONEY ISSUE, BUT IT CAN AND WILL SAVE LIFES.  PLEASE WRITE ME A EMAIL BACK SHOWING THE STATUS OF THIS DEBATE TO EXCURSION7227@AOL.COM",
