        "summary": "I WAS TAKING THE SOUTH I-75 EXIT RAMP TO EAST M-59 AND EXPERIENCED A STALL OUT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RAMP - WHERE YOU MERGE WITH TRAFFIC GOING 65 MPH.  THIS IS A WIDE, SWEEPING RIGHT HAND TURN. I DRIVE THE ROUTE OFTEN, AND HAD EXPERIENCED HESITITATION ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS, BUT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THE CAR STALLED.  THE TANK WAS 1/4 FULL.  AFTER ROLLING TO A STOP UNDER THE I-75 OVERPASS BRIDGE, I PLACED THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND IT STARTED.  I PROCEEDED WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENCE - COUNTING MY BLESSINGS I HAD NOT BEEN REAR-ENDED.    I TOOK THE CAR TO MY REGULAR MECHANIC, AND HE REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE TANK.  HE SHOWED ME HOW THE FILTER WAS DESIGNED AND BECAME EASILY CLOGGED.  HE ALSO SAID THAT FORD HAD OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THIS SITUATION, BUT THERE WAS NO RECALL.    I BELIEVE THIS TO BE A DESIGN DEFECT THAT MUST BE CORRECTED, OR I WILL BE RELACING THE FUEL PUMP IN ANOTHER 30K OR SO MILES.  IT'S NOT ONLY THE $300, BUT THE THOUGHT OF BEING REAR-ENDED THAT SHOULD CONCERN FORD MOTOR COMPANY, AS WELL AS THE AUTHORITIES.",
