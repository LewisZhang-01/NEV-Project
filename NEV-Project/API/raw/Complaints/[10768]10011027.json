        "summary": "THE LOW-BACK BUCKET SEATS IN THE 2001 DODGE GRAND CARAVAN ARE VERY HIGH AND TILTED (HIGHER AT THE KNEES THAN AT THE SPINE) TO THE POINT THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR AN AVERAGE-HEIGHT WOMAN TO REACH THE ACCELERATOR WITHOUT MOVING THE SEAT ALL THE WAY FORWARD.  (AT WHICH POINT THE STEERING WHEEL IS ALMOST TOUCHING THE BODY, THE ELBOWS ARE PRESSED INTO THE SEAT BACK, AND THE KNEES HIT THE STEERING COLUMN WHEN BRAKING).  WHEN THE SEAT IS AT A COMFORATABLE DISTANCE FROM THE STEERING WHEEL, I CANNOT REST MY HEEL ON THE FLOOR, BUT HAVE TO DRIVE WITH MY TOES ONLY.  THE HIGH-BACK BUCKET SEATS I TESTED DID NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM.  THEY WERE LOWER IN THE FRONT (PERHAPS OVERALL).  THE SEAT IS SO HIGH THAT I (AT 5'3\") MUST DUCK MY HEAD IN ORDER TO ENTER THE VEHICLE WITHOUT HITTING IT ON THE DOOR FRAME.",
