IF THE VEHICLE IS DRIVEN MOSTLY ON EXPRESSWAYS, THE OIL CONSUMPTION IS GREATER THAN IF DRIVEN PRIMARILY ON SURFACE STREETS.    I FIRST BROUGHT THIS PROBLEM TO THE ATTENTION OF THE DAIMLERCHRYSLER (DC) DEALERSHIP AT 9,770 MILES, THOUGH I HAD NOTICED IT EARLIER.  AT 9770 MILES, I TOLD THE DEALER THAT THE CAR HAD CONSUMED 1 QUART OF OIL IN 1,000 MILES.   ON A SUBSEQUENT TRIP TO THE DEALER, THE VEHICLE CONSUMED 1 QUART IN JUST 616 MILES.    UNDER WARRANTY AND OVER SEVERAL SERVICE VISITS, THE DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE PC VALVE TWICE AND REPLACED ONE VALVE STEM AND 3 VALVES, ALL VALLVE SEALS, MACHINED THE HEADS AND REPLACED THE WARPED EXHAUST MANIFOLDS.  THE LAST TIME THE VEHICLE WAS IN FOR THIS PROBLEM, THE DEALER HAD IT 15 DAYS.   THE VEHICLE STILL BURNS OIL AT THE SAME RATES AS BEFORE.   DEALER WANTS TO REPLACE THE SHORT BLOCK.  DC HAS OFFERRED TO REPURCHASE VEHICLE BUT WE CANNOT AGREE ON THE PRICE.   I AM SUING UNDR CALIFORNIA'S LEMON LAW",
