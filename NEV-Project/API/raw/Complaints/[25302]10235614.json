WHEN THE DEALER WAS CONTACTED THEY STATED IT WAS PROBABLY WARPED ROTORS AND THEY PROBABLY NEED TURNED.  THIS WILL BE THE SECOND TIME THOSE ROTORS WILL BE TURNED.  THIS IS ALWAYS THE MANUFACTURERS CURE FOR THIS PROBLEM.  IT'S JUST A DELAY UNTIL THE VEHICLE RUNS OUT OF WARRANTY IN ANOTHER 5,000 MILES.  I'VE HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH WARPED ROTORS ON VARIOUS VEHICLES BEFORE AND MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN THAT IT NEVER FIXES THE PROBLEM.  BECAUSE THIS IS A KNOWN ON GOING PROBLEM WHICH OCCURS ON ALL MAKES AND MODELS OF VEHICLES AND ALSO BECAUSE IT HAPPENS TO ONE OF THE VEHICLES MOST CRITICAL SYSTEMS, THE PRACTICE OF TURNING ROTORS TO SOLVE ROTOR WARPING OR ROTOR SHUDDER PROBLEMS SHOULD BE BANNED FOR ALL VEHICLES.  *TR",
