        "summary": "I HAVE A 2005 HYUNDAI ACCENT.  THE TWO FRONT DOOR LATCHES HAVE AN ISSUE WHEN THE WEATHER GETS COLD.  AT AROUND 20 DEGREES OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE THE MECHANISMS JAM/STICK OPEN WHEN THE DOORS ARE OPEN.  IT REQUIRES EITHER UTILIZING A HAIR DRYER OR WARMING THE CAR UP WHILE HOLDING THE DOOR CLOSED TO GET THEM FREED UP, THIS TAKES FROM 15 TO 20 MINUTES.  AS THIS DOES NOT NORMALLY OCCUR AT TEMPERATURES GREATER THAN ABOUT 20 DEGREES I DISAGREE WITH THE MANUFACTURES AND DEALERSHIPS EXPLANATION THAT IT IS DUE TO WATER INTRUSION.  I BELIEVE IT IS RELATED TO THE EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION OF METALS AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE AND THE TOLERANCES OF THE PARTS.  I LIVE IN UPSTATE NEW YORK WHERE MY WIFE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND WE HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OVER THE LAST TWO WINTERS, AND AM FORCED TO LOOK FORWARD TO YET ANOTHER COLD WEATHER SEASON AND THE MOST LIKELY RECURRENCE OF THE ISSUE.  I BELIEVE THESE LATCHES ARE A SAFETY FEATURE OF THE VEHICLE AND IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THEY FAIL IN A VEHICLE DURING AN ACCIDENT.  I HAVE SPOKEN TO OTHER ACCENT OWNERS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED SIMILAR ISSUES WITH EITHER THE FRONT OR REAR LATCHES.   THE MANUFACTURER IS AWARE OF MY COMPLAINT AS IS THE DEALERSHIP I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM.  NEITHER IS WILLING TO REPLACE THE PARTS.  *TR",
