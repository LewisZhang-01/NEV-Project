I STOPPED BY THE LOCAL SATURN GARAGE TO SEE WHAT TYPE OF REPAIR IS RECOMMEND FOR THIS PROBLEM.  THEY ARE QUITE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM WITH NO WARRANTY REPLACEMENT.  THEIR SUGGESTION, IF I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEND THE BUNDLE OF MONEY TO HAVE THE IGNITION SWITCH REPLACED WAS TO CARRY BIC LIGHTER TO WARM THE KEY.  THE SERVICE WRITER SAID THAT SATURN ENGINEERING SPECED THE WRONG TEMPERATURE GREASE TO LUBE THE SWITCH.  NOW, I THE CUSTOMER, HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE ANOTHER GM GENERATED ENGINEERING DESIGN PROBLEM.  THIS IS A VERY ANNOYING PROBLEM BECAUSE I CAN NOT RELY ON AN OTHERWISE PERFECTLY GOOD RUNNING CAR AND CAN'T COUNT ON IT FOR AN EMERGENCY. *TR",
