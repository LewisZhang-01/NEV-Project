        "summary": "AS I WAS MERGING INTO TRAFFIC ON A VERY BUSY HIGHWAY MY 2000 NISSAN XTERRA'S ENGINE CUT OUT.  LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO ROLL OFF THE ROAD INTO A GAS STATION WITHOUT CAUSING AN ACCIDENT.  THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT RESTART AND SEEMED AS THOUGH IT WAS OUT OF GAS EVEN THOUGH THE TANK WAS  FULL.    THE PART THAT FAILED IS THE FUEL SENDING UNIT (NISSAN PART # 25060-4S415) WHICH HAS WIRING THAT CORRODES.  WHEN THE SENDING UNIT FAILS THE FUEL PUMP IS TURNED OFF, WHICH IN TURN SHUTS THE ENGINE OFF.      THE FAILURE OF THE FUEL SENDING UNIT IS VERY SERIOUS.  THE VEHICLE'S ENGINE CAN SHUT OFF AT ANY MOMENT CAUSING OBVIOUS SAFETY CONCERNS.    I HAVE READ ABOUT A HANDFUL OF XTERRA OWNERS ON THE INTERNET THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM.  IF THERE ARE 10 OR SO PEOPLE WRITING ABOUT IT ON THE INTERNET, I'M SURE THERE ARE MANY MORE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM THAT ARE NOT ON THE INTERNET.  WHEN I PURCHASED THE FUEL SENDING UNIT AT MY LOCAL NISSAN DEALER, THE PARTS PERSON TOLD ME THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM AND THAT HE SELLS QUITE A FEW OF THEM.    I CONTACTED NISSAN AND THEY WERE EXTREMELY UNHELPFUL, AND WOULD NOT ADMIT THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM.  NISSAN MUST ISSUE A RECALL AS THIS PROBLEM MAY HARM OR KILL PEOPLE.
