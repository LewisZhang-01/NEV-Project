I JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT YOUR WEBSITE SO I DECIDED TO FILE A COMPLAINT. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE MERCEDES BENZ DEALER AND THEY DIAGNOSED IT AND SAID THE REAR MAIN SEAL NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. I PAID OVER $1100.00 FOR THIS REPAIR AND TOOK THE CAR BACK 3 TIMES WITHIN A WEEK AND A HALF BECAUSE THE OIL LEAK CONTINUED ONLY TO FIND OUT THE OIL COOLER IS WHAT IS LEAKING AND NOT THE REAR MAIN SEAL.  *TR",
