I TOOK IT TO A REPAIR FACILITY AND THERE IS A TEK TIP, FROM TOLEDO TRANS-KIT, WHICH ILLUSTRATES THE PROBLEM.  \"TRANSMISSION HAS GOOD REVERSE UNTIL THE UNIT REACHES FULL OPERATING TEMPERATURE. PRIMARILY AFTER SUBSTAINED HIGHWAY SPEEDS, THE CAUSE HAS BEEN TRACED TO THE USE OF SHORT LIP SEALS ON THE DIRECT DRUM PISTON CAUSING THE DIRECT CLUTCH NOT TO APPLY WHEN REVERSE IS SELECTED.  THIS IS FOR THE THM 4L80-E/4L80-EHD TRANSMISSION BUILT BY CHEVROLET.  I WROTE TO WINNEBAGO AND THEY REFERRED ME TO CHEVROLET.  CHEVROLET SAID THE WARRANTY WAS NOT VALID ANYMORE AND THEY DID NOT OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE ((JIM SLAIN-25 MARCH 2003).",
