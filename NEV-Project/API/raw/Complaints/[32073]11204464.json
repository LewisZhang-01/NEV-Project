WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE, IT WOULD NOT MOVE EVEN THOUGH THE ENGINE WAS STILL RUNNING.  I FOUND THAT THE FRONT WHEELS WERE BOTH POINTED INWARDS (PIGEON-TOED) A SEVERE AMOUNT.  A FLAT-BED TRUCK WAS CALLED TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE FORD DEALER FOR REPAIRS.  THE REPORT FROM THE FORD DEALER IS THAT AN OUTER TIE-ROD END HAD BROKEN COMPLETELY THROUGH IN WHAT WOULD BE CHARACTERIZED AS A BRITTLE FRACTURE.  ACCORDING TO THE DEALER, THERE WAS A BRIGHT CLEAN BREAK NOT TYPICAL OF A FATIGUE FAILURE OR A DUCTILE FAILURE.",
