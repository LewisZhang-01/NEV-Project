THE VEHICLE AHEAD IN THE LANE TO MY LEFT SLOWED FOR A CAR IN FRONT WAITING TO MAKE A LEFT TURN, THEN SUDDENLY VEERED INTO MY LANE.  I HIT THE BRAKES AS HARD AS I COULD, BUT FOR THE FIRST 2-3 SECONDS, MY CAR DIDN'T SLOW DOWN.  IT ALSO DIDN'T MAKE ANY SOUNDS I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED FROM URGENT BRAKING - NO SCREECHING TIRES, ETC.  I CONTINUED TO PUSH THE BRAKE PEDAL HARD.  AFTER 2-3 SECONDS, THE BRAKES FINALLY GRABBED AND MY CAR PULLED TO THE RIGHT.  I CONSIDERED MYSELF LUCKY THAT I HAD ENOUGH ROOM TO AVOID HITTING THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME.",
