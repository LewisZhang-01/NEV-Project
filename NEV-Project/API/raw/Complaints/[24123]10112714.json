ISSUE BEGAN IN THE STANDARD WARRANTY WITH ONLY 33,817 MILES, BUT AFTER MULTIPLE TESTDRIVES AND JUST NORMAL DRIVING, THIS ISSUE HAS CARRIED OVER ONTO THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.  THE INITIAL DAY I TOOK MY CAR IN FOR THIS ISSUE WAS 10/8/2004, LAST TIME IT WAS IN FOR THIS SAME ISSUE WAS 3/4/2005 AND STILL NOT RESOLVED.  THE SERVICE ADVISORS FLAT OUT SAY, \"HONESTLY, WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS CAUSING THIS AND HAVE NO IDEA ON HOW TO FIX IT.\"  SO, I CONTINUE DRIVING THIS CAR THAT DOES AND CAN STALL OUT GOING 60-70 MPH ON THE FREEWAY.  I AM CURRENTLY 7 MONTHS PREGNANT AND HAVE STRESSED AND WORRIED ABOUT THIS ISSUE FOR MAJORITY OF MY PREGNANCY.*AK",
