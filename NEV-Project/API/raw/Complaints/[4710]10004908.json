I FOUND OUT THIS HAS BEEN AN ON GOING PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE AND NISSAN ISN'T TELLING ANYONE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WHEN PURCHASING THIS VEHICLE THA THE WAY THE LIGHTS ARE CONNECTED THEY ARE EASILY STOLEN AND WILL BE AN ON GOING PROBLEM AS LONG AS YOU OWN THIS VEHICLE.  NISSAN WILL RETRO FIT NEW LIGHTS AT THE OWNER'S EXPENSE ABOUT $300.00, WHY SHOULD THE OWNER HAVE TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT NISSAN HAS CREATED BY CONNECTING THE HEAD LIGHTS IN THIS MANNER??",
