I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION WHEN THE ENGINE CUT OUT, AND A COUPLE OF PEOPLE HAD TO MAKE SOME PRETTY SEVERE EMERGENCY MANEUVERS TO AVOID ACCIDENTS DUE TO MY ALMOST-STALLED CAR.  I COULDN'T GET ANY POWER OUT OF IT WITH THE GAS PEDAL.  WHEN I COASTED OFF INTO SOMEONE'S DRIVEWAY, THE CAR BARELY STAYED RUNNING.  IT SHOOK AND MISSED LIKE IT DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH AIR.  THERE WAS A YELLOW WRENCH ICON ON, BUT NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT.  I SHUT DOWN AND REFIRED, AND IT RAN PERFECTLY.  I TOOK IT TO THE LOCAL DEALER, AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NO STORED DATA TO ANALYZE, AND THAT IT DIDN'T DO IT TO THEM ON THE TEST DRIVE.  THEY SAID THERE WASN'T A PROBLEM.  2 MINUTES OF GOOGLING SHOWS A HUGE PROBLEM WITH THE THROTTLE BODIES ON THESE CARS.  WE NEED A RECALL!!  WHAT IF PEOPLE HADN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION WHEN MY CAR FAILED IN THE INTERSECTION?  THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A BIG CRASH.  *TR",
