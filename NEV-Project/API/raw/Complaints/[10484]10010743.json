WHEN I CALLED THE CHRYSLER EAGLE SERVICE CENTER,THEY HAVE TOLD ME THAT THIS RECALL DOESN'T APPLY TO MY CAR,I EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT THE ABS INDICATOR LIGHT HAS BEEN ON FOR A WHILE,WHICH MEANS THAT'S THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH IT.  THEY REPLIED BY SAYING THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE RECALL.  I AM FILING THIS COMPLAINT TO FIND OUT IF THIS RECALL SHOULD HAS BEEN DONE ON MY CAR OR NOT.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT ARE MY OPTIONS IN RESOLVING THIS PROBLEM,THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.  *NLM",
