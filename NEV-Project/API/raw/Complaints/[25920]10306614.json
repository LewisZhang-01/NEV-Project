DIAGNOSIS BY MY MECHANIC, LATER CONFIRMED BY THE INFINITI DEALER, WAS THE FAILURE OF THE PASSENGER SIDE MOOG REAR SUSPENSION MOUNT.   MY MESSAGE TO NISSAN AT THE TIME READ AS FOLLOWS: \"I AM UNPLEASANTLY SURPRISED THAT A BUSHING IN THE REAR SUSPENSION OF MY I30 NEEDS REPLACEMENT, AND THAT THE COMPLETE REAR END MUST BE REPLACED. IT IS GOING TO COST ME $800 TO REPLACE A $40 BUSHING THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER FAILED IN A CAR DRIVEN OVER EXCELLENT ROADS FOR ONLY 87,000 MILES.\"  NISSAN/INFINITI DID NOT AGREE THAT IT WAS UNREASONABLE TO CHARGE CLOSE TO $1,000 FOR  THE REPLACEMENT OF A $40 BUSHING AND REFUSED TO OFFER ANY ACCOMMODATION.  THE CAR NOW HAS 107,000 AND THE PROBLEM PERSISTS. *TR",
