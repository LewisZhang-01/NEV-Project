ONE OF THE RECALS WAS THE REAR SUSPENSION WHERE MY CAR LOST CONTROL AND I VEERED OFF THE ROAD....LUCKILY NOONE WAS HURT. THE REASON WHY I AM WRITING THIS COMPLAINT IS BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A INVESTIGATION ON THE FOCUS FOR VARIOUS PROBLEMS. I WANTED TO ADD TO THE INVESTIGATION BY SAYING THAT I JUST SPENT 340 BUCKS ON MY IGNITION SWITCH BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T TURN WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS A COMMON PROBLEM AND I ALSO HAD PROBLEMS WITH MY CAR STALLING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE THRUWAY. I ALMOST CRASHED INTO AN EIGHTEEN WHEELER! I HAVE HAD THE FUEL PUMP REPLACED AND MY CAR STILL IDOLS VERY ROUGH AND OCCASIONALY STALLS OUT WHEN I AM STOPPED.  FORD SHOULD BE EMBARRASED BY THIS AND SHOULD TAKE ALL FOCUS'S OFF THE ROAD!  I READ THAT THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF FORD FOCUS' WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM BUT NO RECAL WAS ISSUED",
