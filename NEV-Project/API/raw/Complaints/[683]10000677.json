        "summary": "A PART ON THE AIR BAG IN STEERING WHEEL, WHICH I BELIEVE IS CALLED THE \"CLOCK SPRING\", HAS BEEN RECALLED ON THE 1998 DODGE RAM 3500, AS WELL AS, THE 2001. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I OWNED BOTH OF THESE VEHICLES AN DHAD THE RECALLS PERFORMED WHILE I OWNED THEM. I HAVE A 1999 DODGE RAM 3500 AS WELL AND IT IS MAKING THE SAME NOISE THAT THE OTHER TWO DID, BEFORE RECALLS WERE PERFORMED, YET THERE IS NO SUCH RECALL. I HAVE ALSO OBSERVED SOME OTHER PROBLEMS WHICH I FEEL ARE RELATED THAT WILL MOST LIKELY CAUSE A CRASH IN THE FUTURE. THE CRUISE CONTROL SPEEDS UP AFTER IT IS SET EVERY TIME GOING DOWN A HILL OR WHEN THERE IS LITTLE OR NO RESISTANCE AGAINST THE TRUCK. THE TURN SIGNAL ALSO BLINKS OCCASIONALLY (WHETHER CRUISE IS SET OR NOT). THE ABOVE RECALLS ON THE 1998 AND 2001 TRUCKS ARE NO LONGER LISTED HERE IN YOUR DATA, ALTHOUGH THEY WERE AT ONE TIME. I FEEL THE 1999 SHOULD BE A RECALL, SINCE THE OTHERS MADE THE SAME NOISE BEFORE THEY WERE REPAIRED. THE NOISE IN REFERENCE IS A SPRING BEING TWISTED OR STRETCHED SOUND. AHEM, \"CLOCK SPRING\".",
