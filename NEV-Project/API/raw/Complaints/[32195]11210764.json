I HAVE HAD MY POWER STEERING CEASE TO FUNCTION, AND BECOME EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE AT SPEED. LUCKILY I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY, AND ABLE TO SAFELY MANEUVER THE VEHICLE TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY. I SHUT THE VEHICLE OFF AND TURNED IT ON TO SEE IF THE POWER STEERING WOULD RETURN. ON AVERAGE IT TAKES ABOUT 5 CYCLES FOR IT TO RETURN TO NORMAL. IN THE LAST 6 MONTHS, I'VE HAD MY STEERING CEASE FUNCTIONING ABOUT 5 TIMES. THE FIRST TWO TIMES DIDN'T CONCERN ME AS MUCH BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS RANDOM. ONLY UNTIL MY STEERING DIED 3 TIMES IN THE SPAN OF 2 HOURS ON 20MAY19, DID I SUSPECT THIS WAS A SERIOUS ISSUE. APPARENTLY GM SENT OUT A TSB ON 2014-2016MY CHEVROLET SS MODELS, BUT MY 2017MY WAS NOT INCLUDED YET MY VEHICLE IS HAVING THE SAME EXACT FAILURE ACCORDING TO THE TSB FOR THE OTHER MY. I'VE HAD THE STEERING FAIL WHILE DRIVING STRAIGHT ON THE HIGHWAY AND DURING TURNING MANEUVERS DURING CITY DRIVING. DURING STEERING FAILURE, THE DIC DISPLAY WILL CAUTION, \"SERVICE POWER STEERING, DRIVE WITH CARE\".",
