        "summary": "WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR EVERYTHING WAS OK. THEN WITHIN A 6 MONTHS THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT... TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC BECAUSE THE CAR WASN'T COVERED UNDER WARRANTY ANYMORE. THE MECHANIC SAID IT WAS NOT ONLY THE POWER STEERING BUT ALSO THE WHOLE STEERING FRONT END. THEY SAID THE POWER STEERING PUMP GOING OUT WAS THE RESULT OF THE REST OF THE RACK GOING OUT, SINCE IT'S ALL HYDRAULIC. WELL I GOT IT FIXED FOR 600.00 AND LOW AND BEHOLD 6 MONTHS LATER THE SAME THING WENT OUT AGAIN. I WENT THROUGH THIS SITE AND FOUND SEVERAL PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT RELATIVELY THE SAME ISSUE. SINCE MANUFACTURERS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR PRODUCT.. .THAT IS UNLESS SOMEONE DIES, THEN I'M ASSUMING NOTHING CAN BE DONE... BUT TO KEEP SHELLING OUT $$$$$. AND THE SADDEST PART IS... I'M STILL PAYING ON THE CAR.  *NLM",
