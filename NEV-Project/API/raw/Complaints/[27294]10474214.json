I PARKED IN DEPARTMENT STORE PARKING LOT AND CAME OUT AFTER SHOPPING FOR ABOUT 45 MINUTES AND NOTICED A BURNING SMELL COMING FROM PT CRUISER. OPENED THE DRIVERS DOOR AND ODOR BECAME MORE APPARENT. NOTICED SMOKE ROLLING OUT OF STEERING COLUMN. ALSO NOTICED FOG LAMP INDICATOR ON DASHBOARD WAS ON. HOWEVER, ALL LIGHTS AND SWITCHES WERE OFF. I HAD TO PULL OUT SEVERAL FUSES UNTIL I FOUND THE ONE RELATED TO THE FOG LAMPS. THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO QUICKLY POWER OFF THE FOG LAMPS AND STOP THE SMOLDERING. THIS IS A POTENTIAL FIRE HAZARD! *TR",
