I CAN NOT LOOK AT THESE LIGHTS, IF I DO I AM TEMPORARILY BLINDED AND HAVE RESIDUAL VISION DISTURBANCES FOR SEVERAL HOURS FOLLOWING.  IT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LOOK AT A WELDING ARC (ALTHOUGH LESS SEVERE).  THEREFORE, NOW WHEN I SEE THESE HEADLIGHTS IN THE DISTANCE, I HAVE TO EITHER SHUT MY EYES OR HOLD MY HAND UP IN FRONT OF MY FACE TO SHIELD MY EYES FROM THE LIGHT.  PLEASE OUTLAW THESE LIGHTS, THEY ARE A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD.  FORTUNATELY VERY FEW CARS ARE USING THESE LIGHTS AT PRESENT, BUT IF THEY PROLIFERATE, THE HAZARD WILL BE EXTREME. THANK YOU.  *JB",
