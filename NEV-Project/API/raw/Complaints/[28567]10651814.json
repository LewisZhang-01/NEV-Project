YOUR ORGANIZATION'S BOILER PLATE RESPONSES THAT I HAVE RECEIVED ARE UNACCEPTABLE.  I EXPECT THIS ISSUE TO BE FULLY ADDRESSED AND MY AFFECTED AIR BAGS TO BE REPLACED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF THE VEHICLE FIRST REGISTERED IN CA, A HOT AND HUMID STATE.  THROUGHOUT THE LAST 10 YEARS, MY CAR HAS BEEN DRIVEN AND GARAGED IN MANY STATES ACROSS THE NATION THAT ARE HOT AND/OR HUMID, INCLUDING NEW YORK AND NEVADA.  MY CAR IS  IN VERY GOOD CONDITION, AIR BAGS NOT WITHSTANDING, AND I EXPECT TO OPERATE IT FOR MANY MORE YEARS.  HOWEVER, I WILL NOT CONTINUALLY DRIVE A CAR WITH DEFECTIVE AND LETHAL AIR BAGS.  IT HAS BEEN WIDELY KNOWN THAT TAKATA HAS BEEN AWARE OF THEIR AIR BAG DEFECTS SINCE 2001.  CONTINUED DENIAL BY MAZDAUSA TO ADD MY VEHICLE TO ITS CURRENT AIR BAG RECALL CAMPAIGN IS VERY TROUBLESOME.  AIR BAG EQUIPMENT ARE DESIGNED TO SAVE LIVES, NOT END OR MAIM THEM.  I FEET THERE SHOULD BE NO DISCRIMINATION OF VEHICLES IN MAZDA'S PERCEIVED GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF ITS AIR BAG RECALL.  ALL AFFECTED VEHICLES ON THE LIST AS PROVIDED BY THE NHTSA WEBSITE, AT ALL GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS, MUST BE INCLUDED IMMEDIATELY.  THIS CONCERN HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE NHTSA.  I EXPECT IMMEDIATE ACTION ON YOUR PART TO CORRECT THIS BLATANTLY INCOMPLETE RECALL CAMPAIGN.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION.   *TR",
