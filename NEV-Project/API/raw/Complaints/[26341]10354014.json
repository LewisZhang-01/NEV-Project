        "summary": "2010 JETTA TDI STALLS WHEN STARTING OUT.  MOSTLY OCCURS IN 1ST GEAR AND SOMETIMES 2ND GEAR IF SLOWING DOWN (TO TAKE A TURN FOR EXAMPLE).  IT SEEMS AS IF IT NEEDS TO BE GIVEN AN EXTRA SURGE OF FUEL BY DEPRESSING THE GAS PEDAL MORE THAN USUAL IN ORDER TO GET PAST THIS POINT.  I HAVE BEEN DRIVING A MANUAL FOR 15 YEARS - 4 OF THEM JETTAS - AND HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED THIS KIND OF 'PLAY' IN THE CLUTCH.  THIS MAKES FOR AN INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS SITUATION WHEN PULLING OUT ONTO A HIGHWAY WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC. EVEN KNOWING THE POTENTIAL FOR STALLING AND COMPENSATING, I STILL STALL AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK.  I'M NOT SURE IF VW HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THIS AS A SERIOUS PROBLEM YET, BUT I WOULD HOPE IT IS INVESTIGATED AND THAT A FIX IS MADE KNOWN ASAP. *TR",
