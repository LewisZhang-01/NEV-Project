FORD IS WELL AWARE THAT THE TAURUS, 1997 YEAR ONLY, HAS A FAULTY CAM SENSOR, WHOSE MAGNET FALLS DOWN OFF THE CAP AND INTO THE CAM SYNCHRONIZER DESTROYING IT. WHEN MY MECHANIC CALLED FORD W/ THE COMPUTER CODE THAT CAME OFF MY CAR, HE WAS TOLD BY FORD THAT THE 1997'S HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE CAM.    FORD TOLD HIM THAT, BUT WHEN I CALLED THE CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CENTER TODAY IN DETROIT, THEY COULD NOT ACCESS THIS INFORMATION! THEY SAID SINCE I HAD NOT USED A DEALERSHIP I WAS OUT OF LUCK W/ ANY KIND OF REIMBURSEMENT.   SO FORD IS WELL AWARE THAT THEY INSTALLED A FAULTY PART IN THE '97'S. I HAVE THE BROKEN PART IN MY POSSESSION. I DO NOT USE THE  LOCAL DEALERSHIP, S & C FORD, BECAUSE THEY NEVER GET ANYTHING RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. THEY ARE LIKE WORKING WITH LAUREL AND HARDY, SWEET BUT INEPT. I GOT TO KNOW THEM DURING MY WARRANTY PERIOD FOR THIS VEHICLE.   THIS REPAIR WAS DONE BY MY AUTOMOBILE CLUB RECOMMENDED MECHANIC, ALLIED ENGINE & AUTO REPAIR, SAN FRANCISCO, LAST EVENING BETWEEN 5 P.M. AND 6:30 P.M., IE. AFTER MY WORKING HOURS & I WAS ABLE TO PICK UP THE CAR ON THE WAY TO WORK THIS A.M. - A SERVICE NOT AVAILABLE FROM THE DEALER.    TOTAL OUT OF POCKET: CAM SENSOR $55, CAM SYNCHRONIZER $124, LABOR 98 = $277  I SEEK REIMBURSEMENT FOR THIS AMOUNT FROM FORD.",
