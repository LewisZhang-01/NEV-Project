WE HAVE REPLACED THE BULBS WITH STRONG NEW BULBS FROM SYLVANIA (GOLD SERIES) HOWEVER THERE IS NO IMPROVEMENT. WE HAVE BEEN TO CADILLAC DEALERSHIP, THEY WANT TO CHARGE 1,900 DOLLARS TO REPLACE BOTH FAULTY HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLIES WITH THE SAME FAULTY HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY AND CHARGE US FOR IT. KEEP IN MIND THIS IS A BARELY 4 YR OLD CADILLAC THAT YOU CANT EVEN DRIVE AT NIGHT FOR FEAR OF SAFETY. MY CELLPHONE IS BRIGHTER THAT THE HEADLIGHTS, WE HAVE DONE THE COMPARISON. WE HAVE SINCE LEARNED OF PENDING LAWSUITS OVER THE SAME ISSUE, ACCIDENTS, ETC,...IT IS AS MUCH OF A SAFETY HAZARD AS I CAN THINK OF.  A 4 YR OLD CADILLAC THAT YOU CANT DRIVE AT NIGHT DUE TO THE FAULTY, WELL DOCUMENTED DESIGN FLAWS IN THE LIGHT. RIDICULOUS. THE SRX WITHOUT QUESTION A DANGER TO DRIVE AT DUSK, DARK, OR RAIN.",
