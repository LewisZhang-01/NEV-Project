        "summary": "MY COMPLAINT IS ABOUT MY 1995 FORD WINDSTAR VAN WITH THE 3.8 LT V-6 ENGINE.  I BOUGHT MY VAN NEW ON 9/12/95 AND HAVE TAKEN CARE TO KEEP IT IN GOOD SHAPE.  IT HAD RECENTLY, IN LATER PART OF MARCH, BEGAN TO RUN ROUGHLY.  I TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC ON APRIL 1, 2003.  THE MECHANIC INFORMED ME THAT THE HEAD GASKETS HAS BLOWN OUT.  MY VAN ONLY  HAS 55,900 MILES ON IT!  FORD HAD EXTENDED THE WARRANTY TO COVER ONLY THE HEAD GASKETS FOR 100K MILES OR SEVEN YEARS WHICHEVER CAME FIRST.  EVEN THOUGH MY WARRANTY, ACCORDING TO FORD, RAN OUT IN SEPT. 02, I STILL FEEL THAT 56K MILES IS TOO LOW TO SUFFER THIS KIND OF MAJOR REPAIR.  WHEN I CONTACTED FORD, THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.  I FEEL I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR A DEFECTIVE DESIGN BY FORD.  THE MECHANIC SAID THE REPAIR WOULD BE BETWEEN $1000 AND $2000 DOLLARS DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE.  IT COULD EVEN BE HIGHER IF THE DAMAGE IS EXTENSIVE.    *NLM",
