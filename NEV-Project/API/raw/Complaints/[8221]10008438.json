THE DEALER WILL NOT REPLACE ALL THE IGNITION COILS, AND ACCORDING TO VW  ALL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME DEFECTIVE, LEAVING A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION FOR ALL DRIVERS, NOT JUST THE OWNERS OF VW'S . I DO NOT WANT TO DRIVE MY CAR, I AM SO SCARED THAT THE NEXT TIME I WILL NOT BE SO LUCKY.  PLEASE HELP ALL DRIVERS AND ADVISE VW TO FIX ALL IGNITION COILS BEFORE FATALITIES OCCUR.  *JB",
