WHEN I CALLED THE SHOP TO GET AN APPOINTMENT I WAS TOLD THAT THAT WAS A PART THAT HAD BEEN RECALLED BUT ACCORDING TO MY VIN #, MY TRUCK WAS NOT INCLUDED. I HAD TO PAY 594.19, FOR A REPLACEMENT PARTS AND SERVICE. THE PART IS CALLED A MULTIFUNCTION SWITCH, AND THE MECHANIC SAID THAT IT SHORTED OUT. NOW I HAVE DRIVEN LOTS OF CARS AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS SWITCH GOING OUT. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT IF IT SHORTED OUT THAT THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET MY PART REPLACED EVEN IF MY VIN# DIDN'T MATCH. BASICALLY IF CHEVROLET MADE A BAD PART IT SHOULD REPLACE ALL OF THEM, NOT JUST PICK AND CHOSE SO THAT THEY CAN SAVE MONEY.",
