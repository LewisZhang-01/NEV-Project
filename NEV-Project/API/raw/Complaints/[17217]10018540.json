I PARK MY CAR IN THE DRIVEWAY AT NIGHT AND THE NEXT MORNING, THE ROTORS CAN BE COVERED IN RUST.  THIS CAUSES A LARGE AMOUNT OF NOISE WHEN BRAKING.  THE DEALER HAS TURNED THE ROTORS MULTIPLE TIMES.  THEY EVEN REPLACED THE ROTORS ONCE.  UNFORTUNATELY, THEY REPLACE THE ROTORS WITH THE SAME DEFECTIVE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT AND THEY CONTINUE TO RUST.  I HAVE DONE PLENTY OF RESEARCH AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM PONTIAC GRAND AM OWNERS, BUT GM CLAIMS THAT THERE IS NO PROBLEM.   *NLM",
