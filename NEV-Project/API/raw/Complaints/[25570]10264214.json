        "summary": "I HAVE A 2006 MAZDA 5 THAT HAS AN ENGINEERING FAULT IN THE SUSPENSION/STEERING SYSTEM. THIS DEFECT LEADS TO INTENSE UNEVEN WEAR IN TIRES,WHICH LEADS TO A HAZARDOUS SITUATION ON THE ROAD. THE DEALERS MASK THE PROBLEMS BY OVERINFLATING THE TIRES (EVEN MORE DANGEROUS) AND MAZDA NORTH AMERICA REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM.   THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE FROM UK CANADA AND USA THAT I'VE COMMUNICATED WITH AND THEY HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCES WITH THEIR MAZDA 5.   THE ORIGINAL TOYO TIRES FAILED IN THE FIRST YEAR, A SECOND SET OF TIRES PROVIDED BY MAZDA FAILED AFTER THE FIRST 20000 MILES AND EVEN THE MOST EXPENSIVE HIGH PERFORMANCE TIRES FROM GOODYEAR CAN NOT PROVIDE MORE THAN 2 YEARS OR 20000 MILES OF USAGE. I HAVE GONE TO MULTIPLE DEALERS AND SHOPS, THEY ALL SAY THE ALIGNMENT AND BALANCE ARE OK BUT NO ONE CAN IMPROVE THE TIRE SAFETY SITUATION.   I USE THIS CAR TO DRIVE TO WORK AND BACK EVERY DAY AND TO TRANSPORT MY CHILDREN TO SCHOOL AND THEIR ACTIVITIES, ABOUT 12000 MILES / YEAR AND I AM AFRAID THAT SOMETHING BAD MIGHT HAPPEN.     I DO NOT USE THE CAR FOR COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES AND I AM NOT AN AGGRESSIVE DRIVER.    THE CONSTANT REPLACEMENT OF TIRES AND THE EXPENSE INCURRED DID NOT PUT ME IN A SAFER POSITION. ONLY ADDRESSING THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEMS CAN MAKE THIS VEHICLE SAFER FOR ME, MY KIDS AND EVERYONE ELSE ON THE ROAD.     I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND DILIGENCE IN SOLVING THIS PROBLEM! *TR",
