UPON INSPECTION OF THE SUSPENSION THE BOLT CONNECTING THE WHEEL HUB TO THE UPPER PART OF THE MCPHERSON STRUT WAS MISSING. THIS ALLOWED THE STRUT TO FLEX SIDEWAYS WHICH CAUSED THE BOTTOM BRACKET OF THE STRUT CRACK AND FAIL. THIS ALLOWED THE ENTIRE CAR TO FALL ONTO THE FRONT DRIVERS SIDE TIRE. THE PASSENGERS SIDE FRONT SUSPENSION WAS ALSO INSPECTED AND THE SAME BOLT WAS FOUND TO BE APPROXIMATELY 2/3 LOOSENED. BOTH FRONT STRUTS HAD TO BE REPLACED. FORTUNATELY WHEN THIS HAPPENED TO MY DAUGHTER SHE WAS ONLY DOING APPROXIMATELY 25 MPH AS SHE HAD JUST MADE A TURN.  *NM",
