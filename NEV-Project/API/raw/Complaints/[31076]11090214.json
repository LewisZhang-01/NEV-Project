TRIED TO PRESS IT IN AGAIN AND IT WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND STAYED. HAD TO PULL OVER AND POP CAR OUT OF 5TH GEAR AND COULD NO LONGER MOVE AGAIN. HAVING CAR TOWED IN AND FORD WILL LOOK AT CAR FOR THE SECOND TIME. THIS WAS VERY DANGEROUS AGAIN BECAUSE CARS WERE BEHIND ME TAILGATING AND I COULD HAVE BEEN HIT WHEN PULLING OVER WITHOUT ANY POWER TO MOVE OUT OF THE WAY. PLEASE PLEASE CHECK INTO THIS ASAP. COUNTLESS OTHER FOCUS RS OWNERS HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE!",
