        "summary": "ON 23 JAN 14 I TOOK MY VEHICLE (2009 DODGE RAM 1500) TO THE DEALERSHIP (SAN ANTONIO DODGE_CHRYSLER_JEEP_RAM), BECAUSE IT WAS MAKING A LOUD KNOCKING AND POPPING NOISE UNDER THE DASH WHENEVER THE KEY WAS TURNED OFF. THE DEALERSHIP DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS \"MODE DOOR ACTUATORS DEFROST BLEND AND RECIRCULATION BROKEN\" AND MADE THE REPAIR BY REMOVING AND REPLACING THE ACTUATORS. ON 6 FEB 15  I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE THE HVAC CONTROL HEAD MODULE WAS UNRESPONSIVE; AIR WOULD BLOW ONLY FROM THE LOWER FLOOR VENTS, NOTHING FROM THE MID-LEVEL OR DEFROST VENTS. THE DEALERSHIP STATES THAT IT WOULD BE 3 TO 4 DAYS AND COST $100.00 FOR THEM TO LOOK AT IT. . I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO FIRESTONE; THEY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM, PRINTED OUT THE RECALLS AND SERVICE BULLETINS PERTAINING TO THE PROBLEM AND CHARGED ME $44.05 FOR THEIR TROUBLE. THIS WAS THE FIRST I HAD HEARD OF THE \"CUSTOMER SATISFACTION NOTIFICATION K17 AND THE SAFETY RECALL J12?. I CALLED CHRYSLER AND TOLD THEM THAT THE ISSUE I WAS HAVING IS THE SAME AS THOSE ADDRESSED IN THE NOTIFICATION AND RECALL. THEY REPLIED THAT I?D HAVE TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THAT DETERMINATION TO BE MADE.ON 9 FEB 15 I TOOK MY VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY MADE THE REPAIR WHICH WAS TO ?REPLACE A/C CONTROL PANEL AND PROGRAM PANEL AND ACTUATORS TO WORK PROPERLY?. THIS IS THE EXACT REPAIR CALLED FOR IN THE J12 SAFETY RECALL; THEY JUST CHANGED THE NAME FROM HVAC CONTROL HEAD MODULE TO A/C CONTROL PANEL.AFTER THE REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED AND PAID FOR, I SUBMITTED A CLAIM TO CHRYSLER FOR REIMBURSEMENT REFERENCING BOTH THE? K17 NOTIFICATION? AND THE ?J12 RECALL?. THEY DENIED THE CLAIM STATING THAT THE RECALLS HAD ALREADY BEEN PERFORMED SOMETIME IN 2010 AT A COST OF $22.00 AND $47.00 DURING SOME OTHER ROUTINE SERVICE.  THE SERVICE REPAIR COST ON THE TWO OCCASIONS I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO THE DEALER WAS $585.00 AND $444.10.     *TR",
