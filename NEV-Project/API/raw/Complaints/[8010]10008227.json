THE FIRST SERVICE CENTER THAT I TOOK THE CAR TO STATED THAT THE CAR HAD 1 QUART OF OIL, AND COULD BURN 1 QUART OF OIL PER 1,000 MILES WHEN NEW (NOWHERE WAS THIS NOTED IN OWNER'S MANUAL, WHICH RECOMMENDS OIL CHANGES EVERY 5,000 MILES).  OIL CHANGE WAS PERFORMED, WHICH DID NOT REMEDY THE SITUATION.  THE NEXT DEALER THAT THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO IDENTIFIED THAT THE #8 BEARING WAS WORN, WHICH REQUIRED THE ENGINE TO BE REPLACED.  FORD WOULD NOT HONOR THEIR WARRANTY, NOR WOULD THE DEALER OR THE CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER IN MICHIGAN ANSWER ANY OF THE OWNER'S QUESTIONS, EXCEPT THAT THEY WOULD NOT COVER THE ENGINE.  OWNER WAS LEFT PURCHASING A NEW ENGINE ON THEIR OWN.*JB",
