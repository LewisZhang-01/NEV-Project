I AM ALSO HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSMISSION IT HAS BEEN SLIPPING.  THE INTAKE GASKET NEEDS TO REPLACED BECAUSE ANTIFREEZE IS LEAKING OUT AND ONE OF THE LIFTERS IS KNOCKING.  MOST OF THESE PROBLEMS STARTED AT ABOUT 30,000 MILES AND GRADUALLY THERE WAS JUST ONE PROBLEM AFTER ANOTHER.  I TOOK IT IN TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE TRANMISSION AT ABOUT 32,000 MILES AND SINCE THE DEALERSHIP COULDN'T GET IT TO SLIP THEY WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  THE BRAKES STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS AT 40,000 MILES.  I CALLED GM TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE CAR AND GM TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO BECAUSE IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  IF IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY THEY WOULD REPLACED THE ROTORS BECAUSE THE ROTORS WERE TO THIN WHEN THE CAR WAS MANUFACTURED.  I WONDER WHY NO RECALL WAS SENT OUT ON THIS.  THE BRAKES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF A CAR.  THE BATTERY, RADIO AND FAN WERE REPLACED AT ABOUT 30,000 ALSO.  THEN THE FAN WAS REPLACED AGAIN AT ABOUT 70,000.  THE INTAKE STARTED GIVING ME PROBLEMS THAT ABOUT 90,000.  THE SECOND BATTERY WAS INSTALLED AT ABOUT 95,000.  THE LIFTER STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS AT ABOUT 110,000.  THE TRANSMISSION HAS SLIPPED EVER SINCE I GOT THE CAR.",
