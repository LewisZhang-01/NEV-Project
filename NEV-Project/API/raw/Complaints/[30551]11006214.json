IT IS A DOCUMENTED PROBLEM AMONG OWNERS ONLINE IN GROUP DISCUSSIONS.  IN ADDITION, THE SUSPENSION IS FAULTY IN THAT AN UNEXPLAINABLE \"CRACKING\" AND SLICKING NOISE HAS BEEN DULY DOCUMENTED AMONG OWNERS IN THE FRONT TIRES.  SEVERAL HAVE REPORTED THIS WITH AN EFFECTIVE WARRANTY BUT OTHERS HAVE THE ISSUE POST-WARRANTY EXPIRATION.  THIS SHOULD MANDATE A RECALL AS IT PRESENTS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD FOR THE DRIVER AND ALL OTHERS ON THE ROAD.  THE CRACKING NOISES CAN BE HEARD WHEN THE VEHICLE ISTARTS MOVING  FROM A STAND STILL POSITION.  OWNERS OF THE ODYSSEY HAVE ALSO REPORTED THIS PROBLEM ON ONLINE FORUMS.",
