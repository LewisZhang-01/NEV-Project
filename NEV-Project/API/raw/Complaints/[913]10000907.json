A 71 MM HOLE EXISTS IN FLANGE BETWEEN THE 2 EACH 13 MM HOLES FOR THE 10 MM BOLTS.  ONLY 6 MM OF FLANGE STEEL EXISTS BETWEEN 13 MM HOLES AND 71 MM HOLE.  CAB SEPARATED BY TEARING 10 MM BOLT NUTS THROUGH THE 13 MM HOLES AT THE 6 MM DIMENSION.  IT HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE IN AIRCRAFT STRUCTUREAL REPAIR THAT THE MINIMUM DIMENSION FOR HOLE SPACING IS 3 HOLE DIAMETERS (I.E., HOLE SPACING SHOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY 30 MM INSTEAD OF 6 MM).",
