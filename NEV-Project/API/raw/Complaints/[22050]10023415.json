STARTING AND IDLING PROBLEMS LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF EXCESS CARBON BUILD-UP IN THE VALVES AND THE FAILURE OF THE COMBINATION VALVE. THIS VALVE COST ME ABOUT $400 TO REPLACE. VW SAYS THE FUEL INJECTORS SHOULD BE REPLACED BECAUSE THEY ARE A CERTAIN COLOR (OF MANUFACTURE), IMPLYING THEY ARE DEFECTIVE. REPLACING THEM WILL COST ME ABOUT $600, OR ABOUT $1000 FOR EVERYTHING.   *NLM",
