BY THE TIME WE GOT TO A SAFE PLACE TO PULL OVER, THE GAS TANK HAD A LARGE HOLE IN IT FROM SCRAPING ON THE ROAD & 20+ GALLONS OF GASOLINE WAS RUNNING OUT BENEATH OUR VEHICLE.  WE WERE EXTREMELY LUCKY THERE WAS NO FIRE.  WE HAD TO PAY $240 FOR A FLATBED TO GET THE VEHICLE BACK HOME & ANOTHER $500 TO PUT ON A NEW GAS TANK & NEW STRAPS. NOT TO MENTION THE $65 IN GAS THAT POURED OUT ON THE ROAD.  I THINK A WARNING FROM FORD WOULD HAVE SAVED US FROM WHAT EASILY COULD HAVE ENDED IN DISASTER.",
