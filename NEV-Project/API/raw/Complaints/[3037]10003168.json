        "summary": "THE CAR FIRST DEVELOPED A MISS IN THE ENGINE, THEN AS I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AT 55-65 MILES PER HOUR THE CAR WOULD SUDDENLY LOSE POWER. THIS WAS VERY DANGEROUS AND NEARLY CAUSE SEVERLY ACCIDENTS. I WOULD PULL OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND WAIT FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES AND THEN THE CAR WOULD START AGAIN. I TOOK IT TO ONE MECHANIC AND HE REPLACED THE PLUGS, WIRES, AND IGNITION COIL. THE NEXT DAY THE CAR BROKE DOWN AGAIN. I TOOK IT TO ANOTHER MECHANIC THEYDID A DECARBON TREATMENT ON ENGINE. I GOT THE CAR BACK AND IT BROKE DOWN THE NEXT DAY.  I TOOK IT TO ANOTHER MECHANIC HE REPACED A FUEL FILTER. WHEN I DROVE IT HOME IT BROKE DOWN AGAIN. THE NEXT DAY I TOOK IT BACK TO THE SAME MECHANIC, AT THAT POINT HE DROVE THE CAR FOR A FEW DAYS UNTIL IT BROKE DOWN ON HIM WITH THE COMPUTER HOOK TO IT. HE THEN REPLACED PART NO. 22683260 MODULE 3.107 137 AND PART NO. 22626099 RING 3.112 G31 CHECK FOR RECALL OF FUEL TANK FITTING AND DID NOT REPLACE. I LEFT THE PARKING LOT OF THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND NOTICED THAT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON. I TURNED AROUND AND TOOK IT BACK TO THE SAME MECHANIC HE HOOK UP THE COMPUTER SAID HE DID NOT KNOW WHY THE LIGHT WAS ON AND PUT GAS TREATMENT IN THE TANK AND TOLD ME TO DRIVE IT HOME AND ONCE I HAD RUN OUT THIS TANK OF GAS UNHOOK THE BATTERY AND HOOK IT BACK UP AGAIN AND THE LIGHT SHOULD GO OFF. II DID THIS AND THE LIGHT CAME RIGHT BACK ON. AT THIS POINT I HAVE A CAR WITH 50,000 MILES ON IT WHICH I OWE A LOT OF MONEY ON AND CAN NOT TAKE IT OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY FOR FEAR IT WILL BREAK DOWN LEAVE ME STRANDED OR GET IN AN ACCIDENT, OR CATCH ON FIRE.  I HAVE WRITTEN A LETTER TO GM THREE WEEKS AGO WITH NO RESPONSE. IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS I HAVE SPENT OVER 1,500 DOLLARS IN REPAIRS AND THE MECHANICS ARE TELLING ME NOW THE NEXT STEP IS TO TEAR DOWN THE ENGINE AND REPLACE THE PISTONS. WHAT CAN A PERSON DO IN THIS CASE WHERE DO I TURN FOR HELP?????????",
