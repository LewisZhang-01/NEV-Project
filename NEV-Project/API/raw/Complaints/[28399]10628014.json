        "summary": "THE ELECTRICAL POWER WIRES ON THE OEM-INSTALLED FUEL PUMP, LOCATED INSIDE THE VEHICLE'S FUEL TANK, WERE INSTALLED SO THAT THEY CROSSED OVER EACH OTHER ON THEIR WAY FROM THE CONNECTOR OUTSIDE THE TANK TO THE FUEL PUMP INSIDE. ON THREE SIMILAR VEHICLES THAT WE OWN THESE CROSSING SOLID CORE FUEL PUMP WIRES CAME CLOSE ENOUGH TO EACH OTHER SO AS TO TOUCH. ON THIS VEHICLE, HOWEVER, THE WIRES NOT ONLY CROSSED BUT THEY TOUCHED AND THE WIRES WERE RIGID ENOUGH THAT OVER THE YEARS THEY RUBBED AND WORE AWAY THE INSULATION ON BOTH THE RED AND THE BLACK ELECTRICAL WIRES. THIS APPARENTLY ALLOWED THE 12 VOLTS DC POWER TO CROSS FROM ONE WIRE TO THE OTHER, RANDOMLY BYPASSING THE FUEL PUMP AND SERIOUSLY AFFECTING HOW THE VEHICLE'S ENGINE WOULD RUN. WHILE THE OPERATIONAL IMPACT OF THIS PROBLEM WAS A NUISANCE, MORE DISTURBING IS THE POTENTIAL THIS INSTALLATION TECHNIQUE HAS FOR BECOMING A LIFE-THREATENING SITUATION SINCE A SPARK IS THUS POSSIBLE AND SINCE THE WIRES ARE INSIDE A FUEL-VAPOR AREA, INSTEAD OF A LIQUID-FILLED AREA, ANYTIME THE VEHICLE HAS LESS THAN ABOUT HALF A TANK OF GASOLINE.  *TR",
