IT SEEMS TO FIRST OCCUR DURING RAINY WEATHER, BUT PERSISTS EVEN AFTERWARDS. I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM SOMETIME IN 2001 AT 16,800 MILES AND THE DEALER HAD REPLACED THE HAZARD/TURN LIGHTS RELAY/UNIT OR SOME SUCH DEVICE NEAR THE DASHBOARD AND IT HAD WORKED ALRIGHT TILL ABOUT A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED. MY CAR IS NOW AT 40,000 MILES (PAST THE FULL WARRANTY) WHEN I CALLED OLDSMOBILE CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD NO INFORMATION ABOUT SUCH A PROBLEM AND REFUSED TO COMMENT ON WHETHER IT MAY BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY UNLESS I HAD IT CHECKED BY AN OLDSMOBILE DEALER (MY LOCAL DEALER CHARGES $100/HOUR FOR \"DIAGNOSTIC CHARGES\" WHETHER OR NOT THEY FIND ANY PROBLEM AND I DID NOT WANT TO GO TO THEM WITH AN INTERMITTENT COMPLAINT THAT IS PROBABLY NOT UNDER WARRANTY). I NOW NOTICE ON YOUR WEBSITE THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD IDENTICAL PROBLEMS WITH THE HAZARD SWITCH IN CHEVROLET'S AND OLDSMOBILE'S.   *NLM",
