IF MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECTLY I HAD THEM REPLACED A SECOND TIME FOR THE SAME ISSUE. SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN CONTACTED BY TOYOTA REGARDING A RECALL ON THE 09 TACOMA LEAF SPRINGS. RESEARCHING THE INTERNET I FOUND THAT TOYOTA HAD ANNOUNCED IN NOVEMBER OF 2014 THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM, THAT THEY WOULD BE SEEKING A SOLUTION AND NOTIFYING OWNERS. HERE IT IS AUGUST 2015 AND THEY STILL HAVE NOT FOUND A SOLUTION FOR THIS VERY SIMPLE PROBLEM AND I AM IN THE SAME BOAT AS I WAS MONTHS AGO. EACH TIME I CONTACT TOYOTA I AM TOLD THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON A SOLUTION ALMOST A YEAR LATER.",
