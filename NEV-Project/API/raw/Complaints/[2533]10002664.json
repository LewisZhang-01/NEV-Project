OUR TWO CHILDREN, THEN AGES 4 AND 3, WERE ALSO IN THE VEHICLE THE FIRST INCIDENT WAS WHEN I WAS BACKING INTO A PARKING SPACE AT MY DAUGHTERS DANCE STUDIO, THE DANCE WORKS ON ROUTE 125 IN BRADFORD, MASSACHUSETTS, MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE AND THE VEHICLE PROCEEDED TO ACCELERATE ON ITS OWN AND IT CRASHED INTO THE BUILDING BEHIND THE VEHICLE.  NO DAMAGE WAS DONE TO THE VEHICLE AT THIS POINT.    ON THE SAME DAY, THIS OCCURRED AGAIN AS I WAS COMING OFF OF ROUTE 93 AT EXIT 3 IN SALEM, NH. AGAIN, IN THE VEHICLE WERE MYSELF AND OUR TWO CHILDREN.  AT THIS TIME, I WAS COMPLETELY STOPPED AT THE END OF THE RAMP, MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE, AND  THE VEHICLE ACCELERATED ON ITS OWN AGAIN AND CRASHED INTO THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME.  BOTH VEHICLES SUSTAINED DAMAGE DUE TO THIS INCIDENT.  I SUBSEQUENTLY HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED BY AAA TO ROCKINGHAM HONDA IN SALEM, NH.  THE REPORT FROM ROCKINGHAM HONDA STATED THE VEHICLE HAD 5 ACCELERATOR PEDAL POSITION SENSOR CODES STORED.  THE SENSOR WAS REPLACED AND ADJUSTED.  THE POTENTIOMETER CIRCUIT BOARD OF WAS CONTAMINATED WITH GREASE, WHICH THE REPORT STATED WAS THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE VEHICLE ACCELERATING.  THESE INCIDENCES PLACED ME, MY CHILDREN AND THOSE IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THE VEHICLE IN GREAT DANGER.",
