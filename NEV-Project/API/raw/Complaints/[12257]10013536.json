        "summary": "DRIVER SEAT OF 1992 CHEVROLET LUMINA APV MINIVAN HAS BROKEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEAT. IN ITS ORIGINAL CONDITION, SEAT HAD AN \"ADJUSTABLE WHEEL\" ON THE RIGHT REAR SIDE OF THE SEAT FOR ADJUSTING THE BACK OF THE SEAT FORWARD AND BACKWARD.  AFTER THE SEAT BROKE, I INQUIRED AT SEVERAL CHEVROLET DEALERSHIPS IN THE AREA AND THEY ALL STATED THAT THE SEAT IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE THROUGH THE MANUFACTURER.  I CONTACTED SEVERAL JUNK YARDS IN THE AREA BEFORE I FOUND ANOTHER SEAT.  THE SEAT WAS PUT IN AND IT HAS LASTED ABOUT 6 MONTHS AND THE SAME THING HAS HAPPENED TO THIS ONE.  WHEN I INQUIRED AGAIN AT SEVERAL JUNK YARDS, I WAS TOLD BY SEVERAL OF THEM THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH BOTH FRONT SEATS, WITH THESE \"ADJUSTABLE WHEELS\", ON THE CHEVROLET LUMINA APV, PONTIAC TRANSPORT AND THE OLDSMOBILE SILHOUETTE.  IS THERE SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE FOR THESE SEATS?  I DON'T NEED THE SEAT TO ADJUST...IT CAN BE PERMANENTLY FIXED IN PLACE.  RIGHT NOW, I'M DRIVING AROUND WITH THIS SEAT BACK LAYING IN THE SEAT DIRECTLY BEHIND THE DRIVERS SEAT.  I ALSO BELIEVE THAT HAVING THE SEAT BACK LIKE THAT WHILE I'M TRANSPORTING OTHER PASSENGERS (WITH NO AVAILABLE SEATS LEFT) IS A SAFETY HAZARD FOR THE PASSENGER IN THE SEAT DIRECTLY BEHIND ME.  PLEASE ADVISE...SOON!!   THANKING YOU IN ADVANCE...JOHN HALLMAN.    *NLM",
