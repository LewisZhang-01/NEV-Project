IN MY OPINION, THE VOLTAGE REGULATOR IS NOT REACTING QUICKLY ENOUGH TO RANDOM POWER SURGES (LIKE THE COOLING FAN KICKING ON) AND THEREFORE EVERYTHING DIMS FOR A MOMENT.  THIS IS VERY ANNOYING AND UNSAFE.  I NOTICE IT WHEN IT IS DARK OUTSIDE, ESPECIALLY ON COUNTRY ROADS (NO STREET LIGHTS).  TWO DIFFERENT DEALERS HAVE TRIED TO CONVINCE ME THAT THIS IS NORMAL - BULL! I KNOW A SYSTEM DESIGN PROBLEM WHEN I SEE ONE. I HAVE HAD MOTORISTS ACCUSE ME OF FLASHING MY LIGHTS AT THEM. WHAT'S UP HONESTLY SATURN??!!  WHY CAN'T ANYONE ADMIT THAT THEY DON'T KNOW?  *NLM",
