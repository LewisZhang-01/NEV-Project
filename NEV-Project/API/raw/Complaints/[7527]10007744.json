THERE IS NO REASON FOR ME TO HAVE THESE ISSUES WITH A CAR THAT HAS BARELY BEEN DRIVEN. I CALLED CHRYSLER AND TOLD THEM OF THE ISSUE. I WAS TOLD THAT SINCE IT WAS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO FOR ME AND THAT IT WAS MY PROBLEM. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A DEFECT ON CHRYSLER'S PART. I'VE SPOKEN WITH OTHERS WITH THE SAME DEFECT.",
