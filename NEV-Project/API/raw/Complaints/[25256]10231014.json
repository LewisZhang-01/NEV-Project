EARLY THIS YEAR, THE CAR WOULD FAIL TO START AT ALL WHEN I WENT TO CRANK IT. I'VE HAD IT IN THE SERVICE SHOPS AT TWO DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS, AND THEY'VE BOTH TOLD ME THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG. I WAS STRANDED AGAIN TODAY, BUT THE CAR FINALLY STARTED AFTER I WAITED FOR THE TOW TRUCK FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR. BOTH TIMES THE CAR WAS IN THE SHOP, THE FOLKS WORKING ON IT RAN EVERY TEST THEY NEW OF AND TRIED TO REPEAT THE PROBLEM BUT COULDN'T.  *TR",
