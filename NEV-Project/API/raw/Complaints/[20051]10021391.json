THE OTHER PADS ARE WEARING NORMALLY.  THE TRUCK ALSO HAS A SEVERE BRAKE PULL TO THE RIGHT. THE PULL IS WORSE WHEN HOT.  THE CAR IS UNDRIVEABLE AT THIS TIME.  THE CAR WILL SWITH LANES WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED.  AS AN ASE CERTIFIED AUTO TECHNICIAN I BELIEVE THE CAUSE IS THE USE OF PHENOLIC CALIPER PISTONS.   PHENOLIC PISTONS ARE KNOWN TO CAUSE BRAKE PULLS, LOCKED UP BRAKES AND UNEVEN PAD WEAR.*AK",
