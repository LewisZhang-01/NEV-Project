        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY RETURNING TO WORK FROM MY LUNCH. I HEAR THE THREE WARNING CHIMES AND LOOK AT THE DASH. THE WARNING READS \"POWER STEERING\". I SLOW DOWN TO MAKE MY TURN IN A QUARTER MILE AND REALIZED THAT I NO LONGER HAD THE POWER STEERING. I KNEW I WAS ON THE RECALL LIST FOR THE IGNITION AND WAS STILL WAITING FOR THE PART AT MY LOCAL DEALER. I FOUND ONLINE THE BULLETIN 14115. DATED MARCH 31, 2014, THAT REFERRED TO REPLACING THE POWER STEERING MOTOR IN CARS INCLUDING MY 2010 CHEVROLET COBALT. WHEN I RESTARTED MY CAR, THE STEERING WORKED FOR A FEW BLOCKS THEN WENT OUT AGAIN. MY FATHER TOOK MY CAR TO THE LOCAL DEALER BECAUSE I HAD TO WORK. I HAD PRINTED OUT THE BULLETIN FOR HIM TO TAKE. THE DEALER HAD NOT HEARD OF IT. HE CALLED DETROIT AND SPOKE TO A MAN NAMED AL AT GM HEADQUARTERS. HE DID NOT HAVE THAT BULLETIN EITHER. THE DEALER WENT AHEAD AND FIXED THE IGNITION RECALL PART, BUT COULD NOT GET THE POWER STEERING ISSUE TO HAPPEN. I DROVE IT LESS THAN ONE DAY AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN. I DROVE IMMEDIATELY BACK TO THE DEALER. THEY TOLD ME I NEEDED TO REPLACE THE MOTOR AND POSSIBLY THE STEERING COLUMN. OUT OF POCKET, I PAID FOR THE MOTOR REPLACEMENT. I WAS TOLD IF THEY EVER RECEIVE THE BULLETIN, THEY WOULD REIMBURSE ME. I CHECKED ONLINE FOR THE RECALL ON MY VIN AND IT IS NOT ON THERE. SO IS IT A CURRENT RECALL OR NOT? AND WHY IS GM NOT NOTIFYING PEOPLE ABOUT THIS ISSUE.  *TR",
