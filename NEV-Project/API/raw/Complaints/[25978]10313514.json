        "summary": "I WAS COMING OUT OF A BANK DRIVE-THROUGH WHEN SUDDENLY THE 2007 CAMRY-HYBRID, WITH APPROXIMATELY 34,000 MILES RAN, DID NOT STOP AT THE EXIT TO THE PRINCIPAL STREET, THANKFULLY NO CAR WAS COMING FROM THAT STREET. IT STARTED TO RUN ALSO WITH DIFFICULTY, AND THE VSC SYSTEM APPEARED ON THE SCREEN. I WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEAREST DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT IT WAS PROGRAMMING ISSUE, THEY RE-PROGRAM IT AND THAT WAS IT. THEY COULDN'T EXPLAIN WHY IT DEPROGRAMMED. ELEVEN MONTHS AFTER THAT EVENT, IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  SUDDENLY, THE CAR WOULDN'T STOP WHEN I HIT THE BRAKES, I GOT REALLY NERVOUS AND CALLED A TOWING COMPANY TO GET IT TO THE DEALER. I WAS AT LOW SPEED AND I COULD MANAGE TO STOP. THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR TWO WEEKS AND COULDN'T FIND THE PROBLEM OF WHY THE PROGRAMMING SCRAMBLE LIKE THAT, THEY JUST REPROGRAM IT AND THAT'S ALL FOR THEM. IN THE MEANTIME, I'M SCARED TO DEATH OF GOING TO THE HIGHWAY WITH THAT CAR, SPECIALLY WHEN I THINK IT CAN COMBINE WITH THE ACCELERATOR PROBLEM.  SO FAR TOYOTA HAVE NOT OFFERED ME A SOLUTION AND I'M AFRAID TO USE MY CAR FOR THE SAFETY OF MY KIDS.  PLEASE HELP BY INVESTIGATING THE SOFTWARE ON CAMRY'S AS WELL. *TR",
