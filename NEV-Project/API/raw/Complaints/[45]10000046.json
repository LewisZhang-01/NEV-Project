        "summary": "THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS FAILED WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS ON THE ROAD DURING A SNOWSTORM.  IT APPEARS THAT THE LINKAGE FROM THE DRIVER SIDE WIPER TO THE PASSENGER SIDE WIPER MAY HAVE FAILED.  THE FAILURE OCCURRED BECAUSE SNOW BEING WIPED ON THE DOWNWARD CYCLE OF THE WIPER IS PUSHED INTO AN AREA WHERE THE WIPER ARM IS DESIGNED TO FIT, CAUSING AN OBSTRUCTION TO THE MOVEMENT OF THE WIPER ARM.  HAD THIS FAILURE OCCURRED DUE TO THE DRIVER NEGLECTING TO REMOVE BUILT-UP SNOW FROM THE AREA PRIOR TO PLACING THE VEHICLE INTO SERVICE, I WOULD NOT COMPLAIN.  HOWEVER, THIS FAILURE OCCURRED DUE TO SNOW THAT BUILT UP WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS IN SERVICE ON THE ROAD.    IN ORDER TO PREVENT THIS FROM RECURRING WHILE OPERATING THE VEHICLE IN SIMILAR CONDITIONS, THE OPERATOR WILL HAVE TO PERIODICALLY STOP THE VEHICLE TO REMOVE THE SNOW BUILD-UP IN THE AREA OF IMPINGEMENT BETWEEN THE WIPER ARM AND THE FARING IT FITS INTO.  THIS ACTION REPRESENTS SOME RISK TO THE OPERATOR IF DONE ON THE ROADSIDE.  NOT TAKING THIS RISK HOWEVER CAUSES THE OPERATOR TO RISK DAMAGE TO HIS VEHICLE AS WELL AS LOOSING THE USE OF THE WIPERS.",
