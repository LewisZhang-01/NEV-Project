        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE IN TAMPA, FL (SPEED LIMIT 70 MPH) AND THE TRAFFIC WAS FAIRLY HEAVY.  THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY DECELERATED (THE GAS PEDAL WAS UNRESPONSIVE) FROM 70 MPH TO 0 MPH.  THIS FORCED ME TO MAKE AN EMERGENCY CHANGE OF TWO LANES TO GET TO A PLACE I COULD PULL OFF SAFELY.  I COASTED TO A SHOULDER SOME DISTANCE UP THE ROAD AS THERE WERE CONCRETE BARRIERS THAT IMMEDIATELY BORDERED THIS STRETCH OF HIGHWAY WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED.  MULTIPLE CARS HAD TO SLAM ON BRAKES AND MAKE LAST-MINUTE LANE CHANGES TO AVOID COLLIDING WITH OTHER VEHICLES NOW FORCED TO DO A FRACTION OF THE SPEED LIMIT.  VERY SCARY.  ONCE STOPPED THE SUV IDLED HEAVILY AROUND 1000RPM AND THEN CUT OFF. I CALLED A MECHANIC WHO STATED TO TRY THE CAR AGAIN AND IT STARTED FINE BUT WITH CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON.  WAS ABLE TO DRIVE TO MECHANIC WITH THIS INCIDENT HAPPENING ONLY ONE MORE TIME (THIS TIME I STAYED NEXT TO EMERGENCY LANE WITH MY HAZARDS ON) AND HE STATED IT WAS CODE P2112 WHICH ON LOOKING UP, IS AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH MULTIPLE FORD ESCAPES 2009-2012 MODELS.  THIS WAS VERY DANGEROUS AND WHEN LOOKING UP INFO, IT SHOWS THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION WITH THE NHTSA AS OF LAST YEAR BUT NO INFO SINCE.  THIS IS HAPPENING FREQUENTLY, MY SPOUSE AND I WERE SO VERY LUCKY THAT NOTHING HAPPENED TO US.  I AM NOW TAKING THE VEHICLE TO FORD WHO STATES IT IS, OF COURSE, NOT UNDER WARRANTY.  HOW IS THIS NOT A RECALL WHEN YOU CAN FIND MANY MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SAME THING HAPPENING ALL OVER THE INTERNET. ALSO, I SAW SOME REVIEWS WHERE DRIVERS HAVE HAD THIS REPLACED MORE THAN ONCE!  SCARY HAPPENINGS.  PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS SITUATION AND ENSURE FORD MAKES THIS RIGHT. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT DRIVING IT AND SCARED TO PUT MY CHILD IN THE VEHICLE KNOWING THAT WHEN IT IS FIXED, THAT ACCORDING TO REPORTS, IT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN.  *TR",
