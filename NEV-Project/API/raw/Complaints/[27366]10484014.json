        "summary": "MULTIPLE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING FOR ABOUT 10 MONTHS NOW ON THIS VEHICLE WHICH RELATES TO ITS SAFETY. I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE IN FALL 2011 FROM SAINT CLAIR FORD DEALERSHIP IN MICHIGAN. IN JAN OF 2012, I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM WORK VIA TELEGRAPH NORTH AROUND 50MPH AND NEAR MAPLE ROAD THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY SAID -THERE IS A THEFT, BRING VEHICLE TO STOP SAFELY IN THE MIDDLE OF 50MPH TRAFFIC(THIS ROAD IS VERY BUSY)! IT WAS SO SCARY. I WAS ABLE TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO THE SHOULDER FINALLY. I RESTARTED THE VEHICLE AND AFTER ABOUT 2 MORE TRIES IT STARTED DRIVING AGAIN AND THEN FEW DAYS LATER IT HAPPENED AGAIN. I BROUGHT THE CAR IN TO THE DEALER AT VILLAGE FORD AND THEY REPLACED SOME COOLANT PUMP ($600) AND SAID IT SHOULD BE OK NOW. AFTER COUPLE DAYS, THIS STARTED AGAIN. AFTER FEW WEEKS I TOOK THE CAR TO ANOTHER FORD DEALERS(SUBURBAN FORD WATERFORD) AND THEY REPLACED ANOTHER COOLING PARTS ($700) BUT THE PROBLEM CAME BACK AFTER A MONTH AGAIN. RECENTLY FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS, I AM GETTING THESE SERIOUS PROBLEMS SOMETIMES TOGETHER AND SOMETIMES BY THEMSELVES AT LEAST 2-3 TIMES A DAY -\"THEFT\" AND BRINGS VEHICLE TO STOP WHILE DRIVING, LF TIRE AND BRINGS VEHICLE TO STOP WHILE DRIVING, SERVICE SOON, SERVICE 4X4, WRENCH LIGHT, ABS LIGHT, BRAKE LIGHT, ETC. BUT THE ERROR CODES GO AWAY WHEN I RESTART AND THEN SOMETHING NEW COMES AFTER DRIVING 5 TO 6 MILES. WHEN I HAD TIME TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER, THEY SAID THERE ARE NO ERROR CODES TO READ. ALL THE ERROR CODES GET DELETED AFTER I TURN THE VEHICLE OFF. THIS TIME I GOT SERVICE SOON LIGHT AND SERVICE 4X4 LIGHT AND BRAKES FAILED EARLIER FOR A WHILE AND I SHOWED IT TO THE DEALER WITHOUT TURNING THE VEHICLE OFF. WE WILL SEE IF THERE ARE ANY RESOLUTIONS. THIS IS A VERY UNSAFE VEHICLE.  *TR",
