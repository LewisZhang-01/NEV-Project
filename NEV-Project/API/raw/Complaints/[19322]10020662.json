POWER STEERING PRESSURE HOSE INSTALLED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE EDGE OF THE BRACKET THAT ATTACHES THE STEERING DAMPENER TO THE STEERING CONTROL ARM RUBBED THE HOSE CAUSING IT TO SUDDENLY RUPTURE RESULTING IN LOSS OF POWER STEERING AND HYDRA BOOST TO BRAKING SYSTEM. FORTUNATELY IT HAPPENED AS I BACKED THE MOTORHOME OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY RATHER THAN ON THE INTERSTATE OR A MOUNTAIN ROAD. IF THERE ARE OTHERS OUT THERE INSTALLED IN THIS MANNER THEN FORD MAY HAVE A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM BREWING. IF THIS HAD HAPPENED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS IT COULD HAVE BEEN A DISASTER. I FEEL THAT RUNNING POWERSTEERING AND BRAKE BOOST OFF THE SAME HYDRAULIC PUMP IS DANGEROUS. A HOSE , BELT OR PUMP FAILURE CAN RESULT IN LOSS OF STEERING CONTROL AND BRAKES AT THE SAME TIME.
