THE VAN ROLLED DOWN A DRIVEWAY AND MY SON HAD HIS HEAD OUT THE WINDOW AND HE HIT A TREE AND WAS KILLED. GRANTED I AM PARTIALLY AT FAULT FOR LEAVING CHILDREN UNATTENDED FOR LESS THAN 2 MINUTES BUT THE VAN SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GO OUT OF GEAR WITH OUT STEPPING ON THE BREAK. THIS IS NOT A FAMILY SAFE VEHICLE. I KNOW FOR A FACT I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON THAT HAS RAN INSIDE BECAUSE THEY FORGOT SOMETHING AND THE CHILDREN WERE LEFT IN THE VEHICLE.   I JUST WANT DODGE TO BE MADE TO PUT THE SAFETY DEVICE ON THEIR VEHICLES SO NO OTHER CHILDREN ARE NOT HURT OR KILLED.   THE 2003 DODGE NEON ARE ALSO THE SAME WAY. INSERT THE KEY ONLY AND THE CAR WILL SHIFT THRU ALL THE GEARS  THANKS  JILL",
