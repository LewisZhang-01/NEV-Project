AFTER 3 TRIPS TO THE DEALER, I LEARNED TODAY THAT THE GOODYEAR TIRES WERE DEFECTIVE.  I WAS TOLD TO IMMEDIATELY GET NEW TIRES.  THE GOODYEAR DEALER WAS UNRESPONSIVE TO MY NEED. IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT HE DID NOT WANT TO DEAL WITH DEFECTIVE TIRES.  I WENT IMMEDIATELY TO A MICHELIN (SP) DEALER AND PURCHASED 4 NEW TIRES.  THE MICHELIN FOLKS COULD INSERT A CAR KEY FULLY INSIDE SPLITS THAT WERE IN MY TIRES.  I FOUND NEWS REPORTS OF ABC INVESTIGATING GOODYEAR BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT GETTING TO THE PUBLIC, EITHER THROUGH THE MEDIA OR DEALERS.  NO INCIDENT BUT ONLY BECAUSE I TOOK THE TRUCK IN FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND AGAIN COMPLAINED ABOUT DIFFICULTY KEEPING THE TRUCK ON THE ROAD.  THIS COMPLAINT IS SENT IN HOPES THAT AN INVESTIGATION WILL START.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE TIRES WERE FROM A \"BAD BATCH\". HOW MANY TIRES ARE IN A BATCH AND WHERE ARE THE OTHER TIRES?      PLEASE RESPOND AND LET ME KNOW THE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO TAKE.  I WAS MOST FORTUNATE BECAUSE I DRIVE 70 MPH ON INTERSTATE-10 DAILY.  THE OIL CHANGE MAY HAVE PREVENTED AN ACCIDENT AND PERHAPS MY LIFE.    RESPECTFULLY, PATRICIA HUNTER",
