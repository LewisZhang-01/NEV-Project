THE DEALER HAS TESTED THE VEHICLE AND DETERMINED THAT THE ABS PUMP IS FAILED AND COVERED BY A FEDERAL RECALL 96V099000.  THE CAR WAS REPAIRED IN THE 90'S DURING THE RECALL, BUT IT'S FAILED AGAIN.  CHRYSLER HAS GUARANTEED THAT THE RECALL WILL BE HONORED REGARDLESS OF WHEN (FOREVER BASICALLY) OR WHO OWNS THE CAR.  THE DEALER HAS HAD MY CAR NOW 3 MONTHS STILL WAITING ON PARTS.   PLEASE HELP STEP IN AND MAKE CHRYSLER HONOR THE RECALL AND FIX MY CAR.",
