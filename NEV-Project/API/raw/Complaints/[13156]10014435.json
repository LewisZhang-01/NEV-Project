RUSH HOUR, (PRIMARILY LARGE TRUCKS BARRELING DOWN THE HIGHWAY), THE HOOD OF MY CAR POPPED OPEN, SHATTERING MY WINDSHIELD, DENTING AND CAUSING THE HOOD TO HAVE TO BE REPLACED, DENTING THE ROOF, AND CAUSING THE REAR VIEW MIRROR TO FALL OFF.  WITH THE GRACE OF GOD,  I WAS ABLE TO  SAFELY MANEUVER THE VEHICLE OFF THE HIGHWAY.  THE MINOR INJURIES I SUSTAINED WERE TO MY UPPER BACK AND LEFT SIDE OF MY NECK.  THESE INJURIES ARE NOT DISABLING, BUT PAINFUL AND ANNOYING.  I DID NOT SEEK MEDICAL ASSISTANCE THE DAY OF THE ACCIDENT BECAUSE I WAS MORE SHAKEN UP AND IN SHOCK THAT THIS HAPPENED.  *JB",
