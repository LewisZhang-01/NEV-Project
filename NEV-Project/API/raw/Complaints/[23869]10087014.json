THE FAILURE CAUSES THE ABS PUMP TO RUN CONTINUOUSLY AND RENDERS THE ABS SYSTEM INOPERABLE, AND THE TRUCK UNDRIVEABLE.  THE TEMPORARY SOLUTION IS TO REMOVE THE 60 AMP ABS FUSE TO MAKE THE PUMP STOP RUNNING.  MY LOCAL CHEVY DEALER SAYS THE REPAIR WILL COST $1,200.  BASED ON THE NUMBER OF OTHER FAILURES WITH THIS SAME PART, I FEEL THAT THIS IS A DEFECT FROM THE MANUFACTURE AND SHOULD BE RECALLED/REPAIRED BY THEM.  *JB",
