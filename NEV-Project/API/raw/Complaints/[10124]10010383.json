        "summary": "THE FRONT BRAKE LINES FAILED UPON FRONTAL IMPACT. I AM A POLICE OFFICER/ACCIDENT INVESTIGATOR AND I INVESTIGATED AN ACCIDENT INVOLVING A 2002 MITSUBISHI MONTERO SPORT. THE DRIVER OF THE MONTERO IMPACTED THE REAR OF A VEHICLE AHEAD OF HER. THE IMPACT DAMAGED THE LEFT FRONT OF THE MONTERO ENOUGH TO DEPLOY THE AIR BAGS, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE WHEEL FROM ROLLING. THE IMPACT ALSO CAUSED THE LEFT FRONT BRAKE LINE TO BREAK. THE LINE BROKE AT THE POINT WHERE THE FLEXIBLE RUBBER PART OF THE LINE CONNECTS TO THE METAL FITTING THAT IS ATTACHED TO THE INNER FENDER WELL. AFTER THE IMPACT, THE BRAKES WOULD NOT ALLOW THE DRIVER TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO A STOP AND THE VEHICLE THEN WENT OUT OF CONTROL AND IMPACTED A UTILITY POLE. THE SECOND IMPACT WAS ON THE RIGHT FRONT OF THE MONTERO AND IN A SIMILAR MANNER THE RIGHT FRONT BRAKE LINE BROKE. I AM STILL INVESTIGATING, BUT IT APPEARS THE BRAKE LINES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DAMAGED IF THE ATTACHMENT POINT OF THE BRAKE LINE WAS ON THE VEHICLE FRAME AND NOT ON THE INNER FENDER WELL. IT SEEMS WHEN THE FENDER WELL WAS BENT IN THE COLLISION THAT IS WHAT PUT STRESS ON THE RUBBER LINE AND CAUSED IT TO TEAR AWAY LEAVING THE VEHICLE WITHOUT BRAKING AND PREVENTING THE DRIVER FROM BRINGING IT SAFELY TO REST.*JB",
