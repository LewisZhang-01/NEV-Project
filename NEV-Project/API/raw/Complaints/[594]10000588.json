        "summary": "AT 30,000 MILES I HAD TO REPLACE MY TRANSMISSION ON MY NEW CAR DUE TO THE PLASTIC PARTS THAT THEY ARE MADE OUT OF.  I HAD EXTENDED WARRANTY SO THEY CHARGED ME $100.00....  I ALSO HAD TO REPLACE THE STEERING COLUMN DUE TO THE CAR NOT ME CAUSING THE PROBLEM.  I PAID $100.00 THEN ALSO.  I DON'T THINK I SHOULD HAVE PAID A PENNY EITHER TIME.  THESE ARE THE CAR'S PROBLEM'S AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECALLED.  THEY NEVER TOLD ME OF A RECALL.  NOT EVEN THE FORD I BOUGHT IT FROM WOULD TELL ME OF ANY RECALL'S.  BY LAW THEY SHOULD NOTIFY ME, AND TELL ME IF I ASK.   I WAS IN A WRECK ONCE IN THIS CAR AND I FLOORED THE CAR TO AVOID A HEAD ON COLLISION.  THE FRONT WHEEL DRIVE PULLED ME FORWARD AND ONCE I WAS HIT THE ENGINE DIED AND I WAS IN A TAIL SPIN.  THE ONLY THING THAT SAVE US FROM BEING CRUSHED BY THIS TRUCK, WAS ME PULLING UP OUT OF THE WAY BY MY SPEED.  BUT THE ENGINE BEING SHUT OFF COULD HAVE KILLED US.  IF YOUR ENGINE GET'S CUT OFF YOU CAN'T PULL YOUR SELF AWAY FROM THE OTHER CAR'S.  THAT IS A DEADLY MISTAKE CUTTING OFF THE FUEL.",
