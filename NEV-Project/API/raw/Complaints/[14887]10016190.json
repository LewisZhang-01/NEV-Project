THIS ALSO CAUSED THE AXLE TO PULL AWAY COMPLETELY.  I GOT THE CAR FIXED, AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT THE LEFT SIDE LET GO TODAY, AGAIN JUST AS SHE GOT OFF THE INTERSTATE ON HER WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL.  A YEAR AGO OR SO WE HAD THEM CHECKED BECAUSE OF THE RECALL AND THEY SAID THEY WERE OK.  I THINK THEY WERE DEFECTIVE FROM THE START.  BALL JOINTS SHOULD NOT HAVE A TRAUMATIC FAILURE LIKE THIS WITH NO WARNING OR SIGN OF WEAR.  THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WHICH NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF IMMEDIATELY BEFORE SOME ONE GETS HURT.  I ALSO FEEL THAT THE MANUFACTURE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MY COSTS WHICH HAVE NOW TOTALED ABOUT $800.  PLEASE HELP ME IN THIS MATTER AND LET ME KNOW WHO ELSE I SHOULD BE TALKING TO.  I AM NOT GOING TO LET THIS ONE SLIDE BY.   *JB",
