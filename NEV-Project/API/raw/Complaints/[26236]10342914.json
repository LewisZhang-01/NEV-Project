THE RPMS DROPPED TO AROUND 1500, PRESSING THE GAS PEDAL DID NOTHING TO INCREASE THE RPMS.   I HAD TO PULL OVER OUT OF TRAFFIC.  THIS HAPPENED SEVERAL MORE TIMES BEFORE I COULD GET IT TO A JEEP DEALERSHIP IN JULY 2009.   JEEP REPLACED ALL THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS TO INCLUDE THE MAIN COMPUTER AT THE TIME.  THEY SAID THAT THEY FOUND A SENSOR THAT WAS BAD.  THE REPAIRS LASTED FOR ABOUT 10 MONTH AND THEN IT DID IT AGAIN IN MAY OF 2010.   JEEP HAD THE VEHICLE FOR 7 WEEKS TRYING BEFORE THEY GOT IT REPAIRED THE FIRST TIME.  THE LAST TIME IT TOOK 2 WEEKS TO REPAIR IT. *TR",
