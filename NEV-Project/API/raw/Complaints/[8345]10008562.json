I WAS ASSURED BY THE DEALER THAT THIS VEHICLE DID NOT HAVE A RECALL ON THE TRANSMISSION AND THAT THE CAR WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. I STARTED EXPERIENCING SLIPPAGE AND \"CLANKING\" WITHIN 6 MONTHS. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER THREE TIMES COMPLAINING ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION. I WAS ASSURED THAT NO PROBLEM COULD BE FOUND. LESS THAN 6 MONTHS AFTER LAST THE INSPECTION, THE TRANSMISSION FAILED COMPLETELY. AFTER SOME ADDITIONAL RESEARCH I FOUND THIS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL SINCE INCEPTION/INTRODUCTION. I AM INVESTIGATING THE POSSIBILITY OF A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. IT APPEARS SUBARU HAS IGNORED THIS PROBLEM, AND DEALERS CONTINUE TO SELL THESE MODELS, MISREPRESENTING THE POTENTIAL FOR EXTENSIVE AND VERY EXPENSIVE REPAIRS. SUBARU AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS DEFECT.------- DIMS 11 IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS-----769750.  *AK",
