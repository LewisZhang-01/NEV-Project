I REACHED AROUND TO FEEL MY COAT WAS EXTREMELY HOT, SO I GRABBED A FROZEN BOTTLE OF WATER FROM MY LUNCH BAG AND PLACED IT BETWEEN ME AND MY SEAT. NOT THINKING THAT MY SEAT WAS CATCHING FIRE. WHEN I PULLED INTO A PARKING LOT I NOTICED A HOLE IN MY SEAT COVER. I PULLED SEAT COVER OFF AND SAW THE SCORCH MARKS ON MY SEAT. ALSO A BURN MARK ON BACK OF COAT. WHEN I GOT HOME I CHECKED MY BACK AND HAD A SMALL BURN MARK.",
