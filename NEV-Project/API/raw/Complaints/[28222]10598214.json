THE LIGHTS WILL STAY ON FINALLY CAUSING A COMPLETE DRAIN ON OUR BATTERY LAST NIGHT DURING THE NIGHT.  THIS IS A BIG SAFETY CONCERN AS THE DOORS DO NOT LOCK SOMETIME UNTIL SEVERAL MILES DOWN THE ROAD.  WE COULD ALSO BE LEFT STRANDED SOMEWHERE AS WE NEVER KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.  WE GO TO BED ALL LIGHTS ARE OFF AND SOMETIME DURING THE NIGHT THEY COME ON.  WE HAVE TRIED SEVERAL SUGGESTIONS REGARDING ENGINE LUBRICANT ON THE PLUNGER, BUT IT IS A TEMP FIX AT BEST.  THIS IS A SAFETY PROBLEM.  I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT FIXED BY FORD.  CLEARLY IF YOU DO RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH THE FORD EDGES FOR SEVERAL YEARS.",
