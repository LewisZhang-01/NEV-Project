FIRST PROBLEM, AFTER DRIVING ABOUT 30 MILES AND THEN SHUTTING THE ENGINE OFF AND THEN TURNING ON THE ALARM. AFTER ABOUT TEN MINUTES I WOULD DISABLE THE ALARM AND START THE CAR. THE CAR WILL NOT START IT DOESN'T EVEN TURNOVER. THIS HAS HAPPENED TWICE ONCE WHEN MY WIFE WAS DRIVING IT AND WHEN I WAS DRIVING IT. LUCKILY IT HAPPENED TO START FOR MY WIFE AFTER SEVERAL TRIES. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS DEFECT? BY THE WAY, I HAD TO GET THE CAR TOWED TO DEALER AND IT IS STILL THERE.",
