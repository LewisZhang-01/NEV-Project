BASICALLY, THE ABS WOULD ENGAGE, THEN DISENGAGE, AND BEFORE THEY WOULD RE-ENGAGE, THE CAR ROLLED.  IT WAS A NOTICEABLE AMOUNT OF TIME, AND A NOTICEABLE ROLL BEFORE THE ABS RE-ENGAGED.  IT SEEMED LIKE IT TOOK A SECOND.  SINCE THE CAR ROLLED AND WOULDN'T STOP, WE NEEDED TO SWERVE TO MISS TRAFFIC.  TOOK IT TO A DODGE DEALER, AND THEY SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG.  EVEN TEST DROVE IT WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER, POINTED OUT THE ROLL, BUT HE ONLY GAVE ME EXCUSES.  I GUESS IF THE ABS LIGHT DOESN'T COME ON, THEY DON'T THINK ANYTHING IS WRONG.  *JB",
