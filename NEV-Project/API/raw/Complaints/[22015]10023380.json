THE FRONT END PULSATED SO HARD AS THE STEERING WHEEL SHOOK THAT I CONSIDERED IT EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.  I TOOK IT IN AND HAD THE ROTORS TURNED, HOWEVER OVER THE NEXT 8,000 MILES, THE PROBLEM RETURNED AND IS WORSE THAN EVER.  THE VEHICLE IS JUST THREE YEARS OLD AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY NEW ROTORS ARE NEEDED SO SOON ON A VEHICLE THAT IS SUPPOSE TO BE SO TOUGH.  I'M EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.  DODGE SHOULD HAVE CORRECTED THIS PROBLEM.   *NLM",
