        "summary": "1) CAR STALLS AT RANDOM WITHOUT WARNING AND NO APPARENT CAUSE. I'VE HAD THE CAR STALL AT LOW SPEEDS AFTER TURNING (ABLE TO RESTART) BUT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AN INCIDENT OCCURRING 7/9/2017 WHEN I LOST ALL ACCELERATION ON THE INTERSTATE AT 65MPH WHILE TOWING A 3500LB TRAILER. THE TACHOMETER AND SPEEDODOMETER DROPPED IMMEDIATELY TO ZERO. TOTAL SHUTDOWN. CONCURRENTLY ALL THE ELECTRONICS SHUTDOWN, INCLUDING POWER BRAKES. THANKFULLY I WAS ON A FLAT STRETCH OF ROAD AND WAS ABLE TO DRIFT INTO THE BREAKDOWN LANE. THE CAR WOULD NOT RESTART; NO ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE HAZARD LIGHTS AND EMERGENCY BRAKE WERE FUNCTIONING. CAR HAD TO BE TOWED.     3) CRUISE CONTROL FAILS TO MAINTAIN CAR SPEED ON MODERATE DOWNGRADES...RPM'S WILL SHOOT TO 5000, THEN CAR WILL \"TAKE OFF\" INCREASING SPEED BY AS MUCH AS 15 MPH MORE THAN CONTROL IS SET FOR.     MY COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN VERIFIED/REPLICATED BY A JEEP CHRYSLER SERVICE CENTER BUT THEY HAVE STATED THEY CAN'T FIX THE CAR BECAUSE THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS CAUSING THE ISSUE.",
