        "summary": "THIS IS REGARDING A 2007 DODGE CHARGER SRT-8.  THE VEHICLE WAS FUNCTIONING NORMALLY WHEN I WAS SUDDENLY UNABLE TO ACCELERATE IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC.  THE TRACTION CONTROL AND ELECTRONIC THROTTLE CONTROL (ETC) WARNING LIGHTS ILLUMINATED AND THE VEHICLE BEGAN \"SPUTTERING\" AS I TRIED TO ACCELERATE.  I EXITED AT THE NEXT AVAILABLE OFF-RAMP AND CAME TO A STOP AT WHICH POINT THE ENGINE SHUT OFF AND I WAS UNABLE TO START IT AGAIN.  I HAD IT TOWED TO THE NEAREST CHRYSLER/DODGE DEALERSHIP/SERVICE CENTER AND AFTER ABOUT A WEEK I WAS INFORMED THAT THE #2 CYLINDER HAD 0 PSI COMPRESSION.  THEY SAID THEY HAD TO OPEN THE ENGINE TO GET FURTHER INFORMATION AS TO WHY IT HAD NO COMPRESSION.  AFTER OPENING THE ENGINE, THEY FOUND THAT THE VALVE SEAT FOR THE #2 CYLINDER WAS WARN AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.  GIVEN THAT THIS VEHICLE ONLY HAS 70K MILES ON IT, I BELIEVE THIS FAILURE IS PREMATURE.  THERE WERE ABSOLUTELY NO SIGNS OF DEGRADATION IN VEHICLE PERFORMANCE LEADING UP TO THIS INCIDENT.  I USE THIS VEHICLE TO COMMUTE TO WORK ABOUT 35 MILES EACH WAY, EVERYDAY.  I TAKE VERY GOOD CARE OF THE VEHICLE AND SERVICE IT REGULARLY IF NOT EARLIER THAN THE RECOMMENDED MILEAGE/TIME.  *TR",
