        "summary": "MY SON WAS IN HIS HIGH BACK BOOSTER SEAT WHEN THIS HAPPENED. HE WAS IN THE REAR DRIVERS SIDE SITTING WITH HIS SEAT BELT ON. WE CAME HOME AFTER GROCERIES AND I ASKED HIM TO GET INSIDE THE HOUSE WHILE I WAS UNLOADING THE CAR. HE HEARD HIM CRYING, SO I WENT TO HIM TO FIND OUT THAT HE WAS LOCKED IN HIS SEAT BELT AND THE SEAT BELT WAS LOCKED. LUCKILY THE SEAT BELT WAS NEAR HIS WAIST NOT NECK. I CALLED MY HUSBAND AND TRYING TO UNLOCK THE SEAT BELT AND TRIED TO GET HIM OUT. COULD NOT DO ANYTHING, LIFTED HIM A BIT AND REMOVED HIS CARSEAT, THINKING IT WOULD LOOSEN UP, EVEN THAT RETRACTED BACK. AFTER 1 HOUR OF STRUGGLE, WE FINALLY HAD TO CUT THE SEAT BELT WITH A SCISSORS. HIS WAIST WAS TWISTED IN THE BELTS AND HE HAD BRUISES ON HIS WAIST. SO SAD THAT THIS LOCKING TECHNOLOGY WORKS SO BADLY. THIS HAS CAUSED SO MUCH PAID TO ALL OF US SEEING HIM CRY AND GOT STUCK.  *TR",
