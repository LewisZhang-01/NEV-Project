WE SHUT THE VEHICLE OFF AND TURNED IT BACK ON AND IT WORKED. IT WOULD WORK OFF AND ON FOR AWHILE BUT AS OF THE LAST FEW DAYS THERE IS NO POWER STEERING AT ALL. I CALLED GM. THEY ARE SAYING OUR VIN IS NOT INCLUDED.  THIS IS A BUNCH OF CRAP.  THE 2007 G6'S WERE ADDED FOR THIS PROBLEM JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO. I SEE THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS AND GM NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING BEFORE THERE ARE MORE CRASHES OR DEATHS FROM THIS ISSUE. IT IS VERY UNSAFE TO DRIVE. THEY GM DEALERSHIP GAVE ME AN ESTIMATE OF $600 TO FIX THIS. WE DO NOT HAVE THIS KIND OF MONEY TO SPEND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS SOMETHING THAT GM SHOULD HAVE BEEN PAYING FOR ALL ALONG. I AM BEYOND DONE WITH GM IF THEY DON'T RECTIFY THE SITUATION.    *TR",
