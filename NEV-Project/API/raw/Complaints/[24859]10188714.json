IT ALSO CREATES AN AREA OF DARKNESS THAT DOESN'T LIGHT UP STOP SIGNS OR INTERSECTIONS ALONG THESE ROADS .  I FEEL THIS SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE CORRECTED!! I DRIVE ALONG THESE ROADWAYS WHILE IT IS DARK TWICE A DAY 4 TIMES A WEEK ON MY WAY TO AND FROM WORK.  I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IF MY ENTIRE LINE OF VISION WAS LIT UP.  THANKFULLY I HAVE THE USE OF THE HIGH BEAMS THAT DO NOT HAVE THIS DARK BAR. *TR",
