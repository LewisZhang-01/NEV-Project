LAST FRIDAY WHILE TRAVELING TO WORK A TRUCK PULLING A UTILITY TRAILER SUDDENLY STOPPED IN FRONT OF ME AND I HAD TO HIT MY BRAKES, WHEN I DID THEY WENT DIRECTLY TO THE FLOOR AND SINCE I WASN'T REAL CLOSE I FINALLY DID STOP ABOUT 2 INCHES FROM THE UTILITY TRAILER. WHEN THIS HAPPENS AND I PUT MY BRAKES ON I PUSH THE BRAKE PEDAL DOWN AND HOLD IT. BUT THERE ARE NO BRAKES, IT TRIES TO BRAKE BUT THE PEDAL JUST KEEPS ON GOING TO THE FLOOR.I NOTICED AFTERWARD  THAT THE BRAKES SEEM TO READUST THEMSELVES.
