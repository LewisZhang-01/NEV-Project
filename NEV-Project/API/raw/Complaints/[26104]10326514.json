THIS IS THE SAME CONDITIONS AS NHTSA 05V379000 OR GM 05068 WHICH STARTED IN 2005. THE TRUCK WAS LOOKED AT THEN WHEN THERE WAS NO PROBLEMS BUT WHEN THE PROBLEM IS HAPPENING NOW GM SAYS THAT IT IS ONLY A ONE TIME RECALL. THE DEALER LOOKED AT THE TRUCK AND SAID THE HUB WAS WORN AND NEEDED REPLACED FOR $500 PER SIDE. WHEN I QUESTIONED THE SERVICE REP IF THE BEARING WAS WORN HE SAID NO. I THEN ASKED WHAT WAS WORN SINCE THE HUB IS THE BEARING. HE SAID I DID NOT HAVE TO HAVE IT REPAIRED IF I DID NOT WANT TO. I EXPLAINED THAT I WANTED THE RECALL WORK DONE WHICH WAS CLEANING THE RUST FROM THE SENSOR. I ALSO STATED THAT THERE ARE MAGNETS ON THE HUB THAT PASS THE SENSOR CREATING AN ELECTRICAL IMPULSE SO IF THE BEARING WAS NOT WORN ARE THE MAGNETS WORN? HE SAID THE HUB WAS BAD AND NEEDED REPLACED. I DECLINED THE WORK. I COMPLAINED TO GM AND THEY SAID THAT I WAS TOLD IT WAS A BAD SENSOR AND DECLINED THE WORK OR FURTHER DIAGNOSIS. THAT WAS A LIE. I THEN DID THE  RECALL PROCEDURE OF REMOVING THE SENSOR AND CLEANING THE RUST AWAY. THERE IS ALSO NO BEARING PLAY SO THE HUB IS NOT WORN. THE BRAKES NOW WORK FINE. SO A COUPLE OF THINGS HERE. IF THERE IS A SAFETY RECALL AND IT COMES BACK AS THIS DID SHOULD THEY HAVE DONE THIS WORK. SECOND THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT JOE BALL GMC IS RUNNING A SCAM AND MAKING MONEY ON PEOPLE THAT DO NOT KNOW BETTER. *TR",
