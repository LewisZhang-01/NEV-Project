THE SELLER HAD REPLACED THE FILLER HOSE, AND HAD SAID THE PREVIOUS OWNER HAD REPLACED THE GAS TANK, SO HE SAID THERE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY ISSUES.  I HAVE TWO GRANDCHILDREN THAT NEED TO BE ABLE TO RIDE SAFELY IN THIS CAR, AND I REFUSE TO DRIVE IT WITH THIS LEAK ON THERE.  FROM THE OTHER REPORTS THAT I AM READING, THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE, ALONG WITH THE RUSTED FRAME ON THE CAR.  KIA SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO SELL CARS WITHOUT FIXING THESE OTHER MAJOR ISSUES.",
