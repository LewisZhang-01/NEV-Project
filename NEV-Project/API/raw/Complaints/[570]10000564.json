INDICATES THAT THIS IS A MORE WIDESPREAD PROBLEM THAN AUDI IS ADMITTING.  WHEN COIL FAILS, CAR BECOMES UNSAFE AND UNDRIVABLE; ENGINE BARELY HAS ANY POWER.  HUGE SAFETY ISSUE FOR DRIVER AND OTHER CARS ON THE ROAD SHOULD THE COIL FAIL WHILE CAR IS IN USE.  AUDI IS NOT PROACTIVELY REPLACING ALL IGNITION COILS WHEN A VEHICLE PRESENTS WITH ONE FAILED COIL.  AUDI WOULD NOT PROVIDE PRICE QUOTE TO ME FOR REPLACING REMAINING COILS IN THE VEHICLE AT MY EXPENSE (ALSO, THEY HAVE NO AVAILABLE PARTS TO DO THIS, ADVISING THAT THEY ONLY HAVE SUPPLY TO REPLACE FAILED COILS).  I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS CAR IS SAFE TO DRIVE UNTIL ALL COILS ARE REPLACED.  PLEASE DEMAND THAT AUDI RESEARCH THIS PROBLEM AND INITIATE A RECALL TO REPAIR ALL IMPACTED VEHICLES.  DEALER ADVISES THAT THEY ARE SEEING INCREASE IN NUMBER OF VEHICLES PRESENTING WITH FAILED COILS.",
