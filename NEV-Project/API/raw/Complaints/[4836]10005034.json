        "summary": "EXACT DATE OF INITIAL INCIDENT NOT KNOWN.  MY CENTER CONSOLE WAS IN USE WHILE HIGHWAY DRIVING BEHIND A COMMERCIAL VEHICLE IN THE FAR RIGHT HAND LANE.  DEBRIS FELL ONTO THE ROAD AND IN AN EFFORT TO AVOID IT, I SWERVED TO THE LEFT.  THIS ACTION PLACED MORE OF MY WEIGHT ON THE CONSULE AND IT COLLAPSED.  WHEN IT DID SO, I FELL TO THE RIGHT AWAY FROM THE STEERING WHEEL AND PLACED ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON THE GAS PEDEL NEARLY SENDING MYSELF INTO THE MEDIAN AND POSSIBLY FLIPPING OVER.  I DID MANAGE TO COMPENSATE AND AVOIDED AN ACCIDENT BUT WAS VERY SHACKENED AND HAD TO PULLOVER TO COMPOSE MYSELF.  SINCE THEN THE CONSULE HAS BEEN REPLACED 3 TIMES.  THE PARTS DEPARTMENT HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS SHOULD BE LOOKED AT BY NISSAN AND THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT ADVISED ME I USE THE CENTER CONSOLE INCORRECTLY AND NO PRESURE OR WEIGHT WAS MENT TO BE PLACED ON THIS COMPONENT.      IN MY 30 YEARS DRIVING I HAVE DRIVEN MANY CARS WITH CONSOLS AND HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED THIS PROBLEM.  I AM OF AVERAGE HEIGHT AND WEIGHT AND DO NOT BELIEVE THAT I HAVE CAUSED THIS PROBLEM AND THAT A CONSOLE SHOULD STAND UP TO AVERAGE USE.",
