MY VEHICLE WHICH FOR SOME REASON IS NOT PART OF THE RECALL HAS HAD THIS EXACT FAILURE FOR OVER 1 YEAR, AS HAVE MANY OTHER NISSAN OWNERS.  THE PROBLEM CREATES A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONCERN WHEN YOU ARE UNABLE TO RECEIVE AN ACCURATE READING ON THE FUEL LEVEL.  AND NOW IT WILL NOT PASS A STATE EMISSIONS TEST, BECAUSE OF THE SES LIGHT.  I HAVE TRIED TO DEAL WITH NISSAN AND EVERY TIME I DISCUSS THE ISSUE WITH THEM THEY EXPLAIN THAT IT IS NOT PART OF THE RECALL.  I AM GOING FORTH WITH A COMPLAINT THROUGH NISSAN AND A COMPLAINT THROUGH THE NHTSA TO HELP PROTECT OTHERS. *TR",
