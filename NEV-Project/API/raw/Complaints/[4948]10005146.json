WHEN I WAS DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY TO WORK, THE CAR STARTED SHUDDERING VIOLENTLY AND THEN THE MALFUNCTION INDICATOR LAMP CAME ON. I WAS AMOST RUN DOWN BY A TRUCK BEHIND ME, AS THE CAR BEGAN TO LOSE POWER QUICKLY. VW REFUSED TO REVEAL ANY INFORMATION AND THE DEALER TOOK THREE DAYS TO ATTEND TO THE CAR AND REFUSED TO PROVIDE A LOANER CAR. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN OK IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES, EXCEPT THAT THE PROBLEM WAS DUE TO A FAULTY IGNITION COIL AND I FELT EXTREMELY CHEATED TO FIND OUT THAT VW AND THEIR DEALERS WERE AWARE OF THESE PROBLEMS IN 1.8T MODELS ALL ALONG, BUT HAVE REFUSED TO RECALL THESE CARS OR PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE TO THEIR CONSUMERS.   VW WILL NOT REPLACE ALL THE IGNITION COILS, JUST THE ONES THAT FAILED. NOW I AM VERY WORRIED THAT I WILL BE RUN OVER THE NEXT TIME ANOTHER IGNITION COIL HAPPENS TO FAIL WHILE I AM DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY. SHOULDNT VW BE MADE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR FAULTS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR TRYING TO DECIEVE THEIR CUSTOMERS?",
