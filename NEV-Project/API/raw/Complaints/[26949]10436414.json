THERE ARE LARGE CRACKS STARTING FROM WHERE THE DASH MEETS THE WINDSHIELD AND EXTENDING OUT TO THE END OF THE DASH. THERE ARE TRIANGULAR HOLES WHERE THE DASH HAS FALLEN THROUGH. THERE ARE ROUGHLY 8 LARGE CRACKS, EACH HAVING ROUGHLY 3 OR 4 SMALLER CRACKS RADIATING PERPENDICULAR TO THE MAIN CRACKS. THE CRACKS ARE VERY SHARP, AND CAN CAUSE THE POTENTIAL FOR HARM. WHEN THE A/C IS TURNED ON, THERE HAS BEEN PIECES OF SMALL PLASTIC THROWN OUT OF THE DUCT. THIS IS A MAJOR HAZARD, ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING. ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH THE CRACKS AND HOLES IS THAT THERE IS NOW A CHANGE IN CONTRAST UPON REFLECTION FROM THE WINDSHIELD, WHICH IS VERY DISTRACTING. INSTEAD OF HAVING A CONSTANT TAN COLOR BEING REFLECTED, THERE IS TAN WITH BLACK INTERRUPTIONS.  *TR",
