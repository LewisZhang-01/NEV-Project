        "summary": "WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS STOPPED AT SEVERAL STOP LIGHTS AND IN A PARKING LOT WITH THE BRAKES APPLIED, THE VEHICLE LUNGED FORWARD AND WOULD NOT STOP UNTIL I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION SWITCH. IT ALMOST CAUSED 3 COLLISIONS. THE VEHICLE WAS THEN TOWED TO THE DEALER (COURTESY ISUZU) WHERE WE BOUGHT IT. YOU CAN CALL ME AT 813-843-8238 (CELL) OR 813-654-7134 (HOME) OR CALL FRANK BROZNIK - SERVICE MGR. AT COURTESEY ISUZU 9204 ADAMO DR TAMPA FL. 33619. (813)626-4200. FRANK THINKS WATER HAS GOTTEN INTO THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKE ELECTRICAL BOARD AND CAUSED THIS PROBLEM. THIS CAR HAS NEVER BEEN SUBJECTED TO FLOOD OR OTHER EXTREME EXPOSURE TO WATER. IF THERE IS WATER IN THIS CIRCUIT, THE CIRCUIT WAS NOT PROTECTED ADEQUATELY. THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKE WARNING LIGHT NEVER SHOWED A PROBLEM AND ACCORDING TO FRANK, THE COMPUTER DIAGNOSTICS SHOWED NO DEFECT CODES. FRANK EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM WHEN HE TEST DROVE THIS VEHICLE. ISUZU IS TRYING TO BLAME GLAZING OF THE BRAKE PADS AND / OR DISCS. FRANK AGREES WITH ME THAT THE PROBLEM IS A SEVERE SAFETY ISSUE. *JB",
