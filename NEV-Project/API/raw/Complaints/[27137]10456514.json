THIS HAPPENED ON 2/27/12, 2/29/12 , 3/15/12, 3/25/12, AND 4/23/12.  EVEN WHEN SLOWING DOWN TOWARDS THE END OF THE FILL UP, IT STILL SPILLS OVER, JUST LESS SEVERE.   I TOOK IT INTO THE DEALER. THEY PERFORMED A FUEL SYSTEM SOFTWARE UPGRADE ON 4/06/12, BUT THAT DID NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM. THIS IS A HUGE NUISANCE (NOT TO MENTION SAFETY/FIRE HAZARD) AND FROM WHAT LITTLE RESEARCH I'VE DONE, DOES NOT SOUND LIKE AN ISOLATED PROBLEM.  *TR",
