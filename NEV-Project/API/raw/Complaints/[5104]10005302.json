        "summary": "MY COMPLAINT IS ACTUALLY WITH NISSAN OF AMERICA. I JUST PURCHASED A NEW 350Z AND HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE DRIVER SEAT SHIFTING AND KNOCKING. THE DEALEARSHIP AGREED THERE SEEMED TO BE A PROBLEM AND REPLACED THE DRIVER SEAT TRACK BUT THE SAME THING STILL HAPPENS. THEY SAID TO CONTACT NISSAN USA WHICH I DID. NISSAN USA SAID THEY WOULD GET RIGHT BACK TO ME AND STILL HAVE NOT. IT'S BEEN OVER 6 WEEKS NOW AND THEY HAVEN'T BOTHERED TO RETURN ANY OF MY CALLS OR EMAIL. MY FILE NUMBER AT NISSAN USA CONSUMER AFFAIRS IS 4001914.    THE DEALERSHIP HAS ALSO FILED A CASE WITH THEIR TECH LINE AND THE INCIDENT NUMBER IS 556922.  THE PERSON THAT HANDLED THE CALL IS TIMOTHY AND HIS EMPLOYEE NUMBER IS 3662.  IN A NUT SHELL I WOULD SAY MY COMPLAINT IS ABOUT NISSANS INABILITY TO FIX THE PROBLEM WITH THE DRIVER SEAT.  I FEEL IT IS UNSAFE AND VERY ANNOYING (IT SHIFTS AROUND AND IS NOT SOLID).  THEY IN FACT DID TRY TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE BUT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL.  NOW NISSAN USA IS SAYING THAT IT IS BY DESIGN THE WAY IT IS.    I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HELP YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE IN THIS MATTER.THANKS, GORDON MCELROY",
