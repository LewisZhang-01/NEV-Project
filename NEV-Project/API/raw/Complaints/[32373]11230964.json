IN CRUISE CONTROL, SOMETIMES IT WON'T DECELERATE (ALTHOUGH IT RESPONDS TO BRAKING). THE TRANSMISSION IS NOW DEAD AND MUST BE REPLACED DESPITE THE CAR HAVING ONLY ~85K MILES. IT WAS SERVICED BY FORD UNDER THE POWER TRAIN RECALL A COUPLE YEARS AGO. I DON'T EXPECT ACTION ON THIS. I'M JUST FRUSTRATED TO HAVE TO SPEND $2K ON A 2013 CAR. I REFUSE TO LET FORD WORK ON MY CAR BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEVER FIXED IT. I TRUST MY MECHANIC MORE.",
