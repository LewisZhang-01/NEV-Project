I WAS IN THE FAST LANE AND HAD TO DANGEROUSLY VEER THE VEHICLE TO THE SHOULDER. THE CAR HAD DONE ONLY 50,000 MILES. THE ENGINE BREAKDOWN WAS CAUSED BY SLUDGE AND EXCESSIVE ENGINE WEAR AND TEAR THAT DEVELOPED IN THE CAR WHEN IT HAD DONE JUST 36,000 MILES. THIS WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION BY SUBURBAN TOYOTA OF TROY, MI. I HAVE BEEN REGULAR WITH OIL CHANGE AND PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE AND HAVE RECEIPTS TO PROVE THAT. I FINALLY PAID $4500 FOR FULL ENGINE REPLACEMENT AND SENT THE RECEIPTS AND MAINTENANCE RECORDS TO TOYOTA. TOYOTA HAS REFUSED TO REIMBURSE THIS AMOUNT.  *NLM",
