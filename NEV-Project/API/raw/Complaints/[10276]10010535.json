ABOUT 3 MONTHS LATER I WAS TURNING INTO A GAS STATION AND THE VEHICLES BALL JOINT FELL OFF. IM NOT SURE OF THE DATE OF INCIDENT SOP I ENTERED A GENERIC DATE.    I SOLD THE VEHICLE OVER A YEAR AGO BUT I FORGOT TO SUBMIT THIS INVESTIGATION TO YOUR DEPT. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS BECAUSE THERE MECHANICS DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND THE \"INVESTIGATIONS SPECIALIST\" DID NOT EVEN LOOK AT THE CAR BECAUSE IT WAS NOT CONVENIENT FOR HIM HE STATED.     I COULD OF DIED IF THIS HAPPENED AT AN INTERSECTION WHERE I WAS CROSSING I COULD OF KILLED SOMEONE OR MYSELF.  OR IF I WAS TRAVELING FASTER THAN 10-15 MPH IT COULD OF BEEN MUCH MORE SERIOUS THAN WHAT IT WAS. PROPERTY DAMAGED WAS  OCCURRED ONLY ON MY CAR. THE CRASH WAS NOT WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE BUT ME SLIDING INTO A CURB.   ANOTHER DEALER FIXED THE DAMAGE FREE OF CHARGE BUT I HAD TO FIGHT CHRYSLER TO PAY FOR MY BROKEN FOG LIGHT.    *NLM",
