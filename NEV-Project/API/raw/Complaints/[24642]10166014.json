THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CLOSE CALLS WHEN VEHICLES HAVE HAD TO MOVE AROUND MINE TO AVOID A COLLISION.  THE VEHICLE HALTS AT 10-30 MPH WHEN IT'S SHIFTING AND CONTINUALLY PLACES MY FAMILY IN HARMS WAY.  THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT THIS IS COMMON WITH THE NEW AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE.  MY WIFE WAS ALMOST REAR ENDED WHEN THE VEHICLE STOPPED ACCELERATING FOR APPROXIMATELY 5-10 SECONDS!  *NM",
