        "summary": "I RECENTLY HAD A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH MY 2000 DODGE DURRANGO.  I WAS TRAVELING SOUTH BOUND AT A RATE OF ABOUT 55-60 MPH.  MY CAR SUDDENLY BEGAN TO SHUDDER AND BECAME HARD TO CONTROL.  THE NEXT THING I NEW I HEARD THE LEFT FRONT TIRE BUST AND I WAS ABOUT 2 FEET FROM HITTING A NORTH BOUND CAR.  THE CAR HEADING NORTH BOUND PULLED ALL THE WAY OVER TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE ROAD AND I WAS ABLE TO PULL MY CAR TO MY RIGHT.  AFTER HAVING MY CAR TOWED AND CHECKED BY A MECHANIC I FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS NO PIN HOLDING THE WHEELBEARING IN PLACE.  THIS CAUSED MY WHEELBEARING TO COME OFF MY CAR, THE TIRE TO BURST, THE RIM TO CRACK IN 1/2 AND THE BRAKE LINE TO BE CUT.  THE MECHANIC THAT IS FIXING MY VEHICLE SAYS THAT THIS IS CLEARLY A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT, WHICH NEARLY KILLED ME.  I CALLED DODGE TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM, TO PREVENT THIS SAME TRAGEDY FROM HAPPENING TO ANYONE ELSE.  THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM DODGE TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO SINCE MY CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND IF I WANTED TO BE SURE MY CARE WAS \"SAFE\" I COULD PAY A DODGE MECHANIC TO DO A SAFETY CHECK ON MY VEHICLE.  I HAVE CONTACTED MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND THEY SUGGEST THAT I CONTACT YOUR AGENCY TO REPORT THE PROBLEM.  I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT THIS BEFORE LIVES ARE LOST.  THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.",
