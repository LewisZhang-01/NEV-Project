I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP TO BE FIXED.  WHILE THE CAR WAS IN THE SHOP I RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM AND FOUND THAT MANY FORD ESCAPE OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM.  FORD HAS KNOWN ABOUT THE PROBLEM SINCE 2000, BUT TOOK 18 MONTHS TO FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE ON BOARD COMPUTER.  FORD HAS NOT RECALLED NOR DO THEY COVER THIS REPAIR UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.    *JB",
