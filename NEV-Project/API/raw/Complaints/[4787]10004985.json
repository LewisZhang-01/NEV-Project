I TOOK IT IN TO THE DEALER AND THEY REPAIRED IT. 30,000 MILES LATER( MOSTLY HIGHWAY MILES) THIRD GEAR STARTED MAKING THE SAME SOUND AGAIN.THE DEALER SAID IT WOULD COST ME 900 DOLLARS TO FIX IT SINCE IT WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY ANYMORE.  I CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT THE TRANSMISSION, AND ONLY THIRD GEAR IN A MANUAL FIVE SPEED IS ONLY GOOD FOR 30,000 MILES, MOST OF WHICH IS ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN THIRD GEAR IS NOT USED MUCH.I BELIEVE THAT IS A DEFECT WITH THE CAR ITSELF.",
