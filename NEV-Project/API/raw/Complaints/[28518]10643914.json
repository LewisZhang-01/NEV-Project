I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE GM DEALERSHIP.  I WAS CALLED WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS AND TOLD THAT THE BRAKE LINES HAD BURST AND HAD CORRUPTED ALL OF THE ROTORS AND THE COST WOULD BE OVER $3K TO REPAIR/REPLACE. NOTE: THE ROTORS WERE REPLACED SEP 2013 AND HAD LESS THAN 1K MILEAGE.  I CALLED GM CORPORATE TO ASK FOR RELIEF ON 10/6/14 AND WAS TOLD I WOULD RECEIVE A CALL WITHIN 24 HOURS BY A SENIOR ADVISOR. AFTER NOT HEARING BACK, I CALLED ON 10/10/14 AND WAS TOLD THAT THE VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING. I CITIED ALL THE CASES ON LINE ABOUT FAULTY BRAKE LINES AND NHTSA EA11001 AND THE LADY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY ISSUES. SHE STATED IT WOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DEALERSHIP AND NOT GM. SHE STATED SHE WOULD CALL THE DEALERSHIP THE SAME DAY AND TURN IT OVER TO THEM. THERE WAS NOTHING GM WOULD DO TO ASSIST SINCE IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  PLEASE HELP. WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE INVESTIGATION?   *TR",
