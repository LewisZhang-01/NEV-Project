        "summary": "IT WAS 6:30 IN THE MORNING AND I WAS PULLING INTO MY GYM'S PARKING LOT.  AS I ATTEMPTED TO BRAKE, THE CAR CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE.  I KEPT PUMPING ON THE BRAKE ONLY TO HAVE THE CAR MAKE A GRINDING SOUND AS IT CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE (AS IF IT WERE RESISTING MY ATTEMPTS TO STOP IT).  EVENTUALLY, AND THANKFULLY BEFORE IT HIT THE BUILDING, THE CAR STALLED TO A STOP.  THE CAR ACTUALLY ASCENDED 3 WOODEN PORCH STEPS AND HIT INTO A WOODEN PORCH COLUMN BEFORE STOPPING.      IT WAS A VERY EARLY SATURDAY MORNING.  HAD I PULLED INTO THIS DRIVEWAY MID MORNING, ON THIS SATURDAY (A TIME WHEN THIS GYM IS ESPECIALLY ACTIVE), I COULD VERY WELL HAVE KILLED SOMEBODY.      ON THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT, THE CAR WAS TOWED TO MERCEDES BENZ OF GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT.  AT THE TIME, I WAS GIVEN A LOANER CAR TO DRIVE (AT NO EXPENSE TO ME).  I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT A CASE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED TO INVESTIGATE THE INCIDENT.      AFTER A WEEK'S TIME, I CONTACTED MERCEDES BENZ (800-367-6372  X6302 JUSTIN) IN AN EFFORT TO ASCERTAIN THE STATUS OF THIS INVESTIGATION.  I COULD NOT GET A DIRECT ANSWER OF ANY KIND FROM THE GENTLEMAN THAT I SPOKE TO.  MERCEDES BENZ'S LACK OF COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN VERY DISTURBING GIVEN THE SEVERITY OF THIS SITUATION.    THIS IS A LEASED CAR WHICH I HAVE HAD FOR A LITTLE OVER 1 YEAR.  WITHOUT ANY KIND OF EXPLANATION FROM MB AS TO WHY THIS HAPPENED, I DON'T THINK I WOULD STEP INTO THIS CAR IF AND WHEN IT WAS REPAIRED.      I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY INTERVENTION YOUR DEPARTMENT IS PREPARED TO PUT FORTH ON MY BEHALF HERE    THANK YOU. *TR",
