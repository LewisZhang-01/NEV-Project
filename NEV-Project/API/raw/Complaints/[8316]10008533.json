POWER MOTOR SOUNDS AS IF IT IS STILL WORKING, THEREFORE SUSPECT THE MECHANICAL CLIPS HOLDING THE WINDOW TO THE POWER MOTOR MUST HAVE FAILED. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT WINDOW CLIPS HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM FOR THIS MAKE AND MODEL.  IN FACT, ON NOVEMBER 5, 2002 VW.COM WEBSITE WAS SHOWING A PRESS RELEASE EXPLAINING  THAT WINDOW CLIPS WERE FAILING, AND VW WOULD BE SENDING LETTERS OUT TO 1999-2002 VW OWNERS  ABOUT REPAIRING/REPLACING THE WINDOW CLIPS WITH REDESIGNED CLIPS (NOTE: THIS IS NOT A PART RECALL, BUT ONLY A LETTER TO OWNERS). IN ADDITION, MY FRONT RIGHT WINDOW OCCASIONALLY DOES NOT POWER ITSELF FROM OPEN TO FULLY CLOSED (IT STOPS HALF WAY). ASSUME THIS IS WELL KNOWN \"POWER WINDOW VOLTAGE REGULATOR\" PROBLEM THAT VW IS CURRENTLY COVERING  THE REPAIRS FOR (BUT I CAN NEVER GET THE FAILURE TO REPEAT ITSELF WHEN I BRING IT INTO THE DEALERS SO THEY WONT AGREE TO TELL VW IT IS BROKEN UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY WITNESS THE FAILURE). ****DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****769315.  *AK          *JB",
