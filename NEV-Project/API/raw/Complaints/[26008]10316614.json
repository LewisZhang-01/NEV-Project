CAR HAD ALLEGEDLY HAD ELECTRIC REPAIR TO ABS FOR THE PRIUS, HOWEVER; WILL TAKE TO ANOTHER DEALER TO CONFIRM.    I REALIZE THERE ARE PRIVACY CONCERNS AS AN OWNER, AND I'M NOT LOOKING TO PUT EMPHASIS ON MYSELF, HOWEVER; AFTER SUPPOSED REPAIRS TO THE BRAKE SYSTEM I AM WORRIED THAT THE ELECTRONIC UPDATE TO THE PRIUS 2010 WAS NOT SUFFICIENT.    THE SLIGHT 'JOLT' THAT I FELT MADE ME THINK INITIALLY I WAS BUMPED IN THE BACK OF MY CAR.  THANKS AGAIN FOR INVESTIGATING THIS. *TR",
