        "summary": "WE PURCHASED THIS CAR IN OCTOBER 2017. WE BROUGHT THE CAR IN THREE TIMES IN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS AS THE CAR WOULD NOT ACCELERATE WHEN MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN. IT WOULD SHUTTER AND FEEL LIKE IT WAS GOING TO STALL LEAVING ME IN ONCOMING TRAFFIC FROM THE OPPOSITE LANE. IT WOULD ALSO HAPPEN WHEN BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPOT. THE CAR WOULD SUDDENLY JOLT FORWARD WHEN THE GAS PEDAL WAS PRESSED MULTIPLE TIMES. THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO RECREATE THE PROBLEM AS IT COMES AND GOES ALL THE TIME AND HAPPENS WITHOUT WARNING. THE CAR FUNCTIONS HORRIBLY IN TRAFFIC HESITATING AND THEN JOLTING FORWARD BEING A SAFETY HAZARD WHEN ROLLING. LAST WEEK MY CAR COMPLETELY SHUT OFF WHILE I WAS DRIVING IT WITH MY CHILDREN IN THE CAR. I HAD TO COAST TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND PUT IT IN PARK. IT MADE A LOUD CLUNKING NOISE. I TURNING THE CAR OFF AND THEN BACK ON. I WAS THEN ABLE TO DRIVE IT HOME. THE DEALERSHIP SAYS IT IISNT THROWING ANY CODES OR INDICATING ANY PROBLEMS. THEY REPORT THAT MY COMPUTER IS UP TO DATE. THIS CAR IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND I AM TERRIFIED TO DRIVE IT. HYUNDAI WON'T BUY IT BACK SAYING THAT I JUST NEED TO LEARN 'HOW TO DRIVE MY CAR.' THEY OFFERED ME TWO MONTHS PAYMENTS. I WILL NOT PUT MY FAMILY BACK IN THIS CAR AND THEY WANT ME TO TAKE THIS CAR BACK. THIS CAR SHOULD BE RECALLED AND TAKEN OFF THE ROAD!",
