THE CAR SUDDENLY TOOK OFF AND BEFORE I KNEW, I HAD CRASHED INTO THE SIDE OF THE GARAGE AND WENT THROUGH IT. THE CAR SMASHED INTO GARDENING TOOLS, SNOW SHOVELS, LAWN MOWER, LEAF BLOWER, TRASH CANS, AND FLOWERING POTS. IT CAME TO A STOP PARTLY BY THE COAT CLOSET WALL THAT PROTRUDES INTO THE GARAGE AND PARTLY BY ALL THE STUFF THAT GOT CAUGHT UNDER THE CAR. THE GARAGE DOOR RAILING WAS DAMAGED AND THE DOOR WAS HANGING A FEW INCHES ABOVE MY CAR. I HEARD THINGS FALLING ABOVE ME. I THOUGHT THAT THE ROOF WOULD COLLAPSE. I REALIZED THAT THE CAR WAS STILL REVVING AND I SHUT IT. I SAT FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN I OPENED THE DOOR AND RAN OUT INTO THE HOUSE. THE CAR, THE GARAGE, AND GARAGE CONTENTS WERE DAMAGED. THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.    I THINK IT WAS CAUSED BY UNINTENDED ACCELERATION. I WAS DRIVING AT ABOUT 5 MPH IN THE DRIVEWAY AND I HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS. IT APPEARED THAT THE CAR JUST FLEW AND I HAD NO CONTROL OVER IT.  *TR",
