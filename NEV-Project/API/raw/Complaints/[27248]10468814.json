THE DASH ON THE PASSENGER SIDE ABOVE THE AIRBAG HAS BEEN CRACKING FOR SOMETIME NOW  AND WHAT ONCE STARTED AS A SMALL CRACK, IS NOW A SPIDERWEB OF CRACKS THAT EXTENDS OVER THE ENTIRE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE DASH. WHEN SEARCHING ON THE INTERNET FOR A USED DASH I CAME ACROSS THE FOLLOWING THREAD: HTTP://WWW.AUTOMOTIVEFORUMS.COM/T959673-DISCUSS2004_SIENNA_CRACKED_DASHBOARD.HTML AND DISCOVERED THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT, THAT IT HAS, IN FACT, OCCURRED IN MANY 04 SIENNA'S. I, ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD DUE TO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE ALREADY CRACKED DASH IF THE AIRBAG WERE TO DEPLOY. I HAVE CALLED TOYOTA AND REGISTERED A COMPLAINT AND WAS ASSIGNED CASE #: 1207232487. I HAVE ALSO EMAILED TOYOTA WITH A COMPLAINT AS WELL. BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS, I BELIEVE TOYOTA SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL. I NEED A NEW DASH, AND BECAUSE IT'S OBVIOUSLY A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT.  *TR",
