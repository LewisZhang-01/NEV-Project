        "summary": "I OWN A 2000 TOYOTA TUNDRA. I BOUGHT THE TRUCK USED FROM AN OWNER IN BURLINGTON VERMONT ON 10/4/07. THE TRUCK IS GARAGED IN CONCORD NH. I TOOK THE TRUCK FOR AN ANNUAL INSPECTION AS REQUIRED BY NH ON 3/31/10. I WAS INFORMED THAT THE VEHICLE WOULD BE UNINSPECTABLE NEXT YEAR. THE ASE CERTIFIED MECHANIC SUGGESTED THAT I HAVE A FRAME INSPECTION PERFORMED BY TOYOTA DUE TO THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF RUST ON THE FRAME AND CROSS MEMBERS. I TOOK THE TUNDRA TO THE LOCAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP FOR THE INSPECTION. I WAS TOLD THAT THE TUNDRA HAD FRAME DAMAGE (RUST THROUGH HOLES) AND WAS ADVISED NOT TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE. I WAS SUPPLIED WITH A RENTAL VEHICLE AND THE TOYOTA CUSTOMER REPORTING PHONE NUMBER. I FILED A CLAIM WITH TOYOTA ON 4/1/10. TOYOTA CALLED ME 4/5/10 AND SAID THAT THEY WILL SEND A REPRESENTATIVE TO INSPECT THE VEHICLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. I AM WAITING FOR A DETERMINATION FROM TOYOTA ON WHAT, IF ANY ACTION THEY WILL TAKE. THE BODY, BED AND ENGINE OF THIS VEHICLE IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION WITH 132K MILES.  *TR",
