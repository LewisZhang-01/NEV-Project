UNDER NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS, THE REAR VIEW MIRROR VIBRATES TO THE POINT OF DISTORTING THE VISION / VIEW FROM THE MIRROR.  THIS HAPPENS WHEN DRIVING AT LOW SPEEDS ON PAVED CITY STREETS AND AT HIGHER SPEEDS ON PAVED HIGHWAYS. THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO CROP UP  MOSTLY WHEN IT IS HOT OUTSIDE, BUT THE VEHICLE IS IN FLORIDA WHERE HIGH OUTSIDE TEMPS ARE COMMON AND OFTEN YEAR ROUND.       OTHER HONDA RIDGELINE OWNERS HAVE REPORTED THIS ISSUE VIA ONLINE CHAT GROUPS / FORUMS.      I HAVE REPORTED THE ISSUE TO HONDA USA BUT NEVER GOT A RESPONSE OR CALL BACK.    AT THE LEAST, THIS IS AN ANNOYANCE THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY HONDA.  AT WORST, IT PRESENTS A SERIOUS VISIBILITY / SAFETY ISSUE.",
