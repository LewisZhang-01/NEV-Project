DOORS COULD BE OPEN FROM THE OUTSIDE (BY ROLLING THE WINDOW DOWN AND OPENING IT USING THE OUTSIDE DOOR HANDLE). THE DRIVER'S DOOR LOCK IS CURRENTLY BROKEN - IF THE DRIVER IS INSIDE WITHOUT KEYS (KEYS ARE NECESSARY TO TURN ON POWER SO THE DOOR WINDOW CAN BE ROLLED DOWN), HE MUST THEN CLIMB OVER THE CENTER CONSOLE TO EXIT THROUGH THE PASSENGER DOOR. AS MENTIONED, THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR LOCK IS CURRENTLY NON-OPENABLE FROM THE INSIDE, BUT ALL OTHER DOORS HAVE HAD THE SAME DEFECT. THERE IS A NEOPRENE DOOR LOCK PART THAT BREAKS AFTER 100,000 MILES OR SO (I WOULD GUESS), WHICH CAUSES THIS PROBLEM.    *NLM",
