WHEN STOPPED AT A STOP LIGHT, OR STOP SIGN, THE CAR WANTS TO KEEP MOVING, EVEN THOUGH HEAVY BRAKE PRESSURE IS BEING APPLIED. WHEN I AM AT A STOP LIGHT AND THE LIGHT TURNS GREEN TO MOVE FORWARD, THE CAR HESITATES TO MOVE, CAUSING THE VEHICLES BEHIND ME TO BLOW THEIR HORN! THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO!! THIS CAR IS GOING TO CAUSE MYSELF OR OTHER OWNERS AN ACCIDENT WITH NO DOUBT IN MY MIND! THE HESITATION TO TAKE OFF WHEN I'M WANTING TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC, SCARES ME TO  DEATH!!! SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE AN INNOCENT LIFE OR LIVES ARE LOST!!!  *TR",
