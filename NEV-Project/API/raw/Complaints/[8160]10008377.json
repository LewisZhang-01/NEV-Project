I SCHEDULED FOR THE RECALL SERVICE (RACK & PINION/BEARINGS) TO BE REPLACED ON MY VEHICLE.  AFTER MY CAR HAD BEEN AT THE DEALER ALL DAY, I WAS TOLD LATE THAT AFTERNOON THAT THE RECALL PART NEEDED TO SERVICE MY VEHICLE WOULD NOT BE IN FOR 1 TO 2 WEEKS (CLOSER TO 2 WEEKS).  I WAS ALSO TOLD AT THAT TIME THAT IT WAS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, DUE TO DANGER REASONS THAT I DID NOT OPERATE THIS VEHICLE, BECAUSE MY VEHICLE WAS SEVERELY DAMAGED IN THE RECALL AREA.  THEY EVEN SAID, THAT MOST OF THE BEARING BALLS WERE GONE OR DAMAGED.  I WAS THEN TOLD THAT THEY DID NOT EVEN KNOW IF THEY COULD RELEASE MY VEHICLE BACK TO ME IN THIS CONDITION.   AND ALTHOUGH THIS IS MY ONLY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION, THE PONTIAC DEALER TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE NOT OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE A LOANER OR RENTAL VEHICLE TO ME.    THIS IS INSANE. THIS SHOULD BE AGAINST THE LAW.  THEY SENT OUT RECALL NOTICES THAT STATED THAT WE HAVE CARS SERVICED BY THE DEALER ASAP, BUT THEY WON'T FULLY STAND BY THERE PRODUCT ENOUGH TO MAKE THE CUSTOMER SAFE AND SATISFIED.  I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN NOR MYSELF TO BE ENDANGERED DUE TO THE FAULT THEY THESE CARS ARE NOT SAFE.  *NLM",
