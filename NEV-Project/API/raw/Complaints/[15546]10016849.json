THE DEALER WAS ABLE TO HAVE THIS OCCUR ON A TEST RIDE, THEY HAD NO ANSWER TO WHY THIS HAPPENS.   THEY ADDED A DEVICE THAT I HAVE TO PUSH WHEN THIS OCCURS SO I CAN CAPTURE A PICTURE OF THE CARS COMPUTER IS DOING WHILE THIS OCCURS.   I HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF OTHER 03 COBRA OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  FORD NEEDS TO HAVE A TSB ON THIS SOON THIS CAR HAS BEEN IN PRODUCTION OVER A YEAR.  THIS CAUSES A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION, LOSING POWER BRAKES AND STEERING.",
