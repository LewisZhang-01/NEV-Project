THIS OIL LEAK IS BECAUSE THE DEALER THAT REPLACED MY ENGINE DIDN'T INSTALL IT CORRECTLY. THEY PUT ONE OF THE SUSPECTED BAD PARTS BACK IN WITH TWO NEW SEALS AROUND IT, I DON'T THINK THAT IS RIGHT. I BOUGHT A NEW TRUCK, I SHOULD GET NEW REPLACEMENT PARTS WHEN IT BREAKS DOWN. DEALERS NAME IS LARRY MILLER DODGE 623-815-2250. MY TRUCK ONLY HAS 2400 MILES ON IT. I HAVE ONLY OWNED IT FOR TWO AND A HALF MONTHS, NO ONE WILL RETURN MY CALLS FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE TRUCK. IT HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP FOR OVER 30 DAYS.   *JB",
