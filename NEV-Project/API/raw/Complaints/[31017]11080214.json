THE NEXT MESSAGE IS, \"TRACTION CONTROL OFF\". IT IS THEN FOLLOWING BY, \"ENGINE POWER IS REDUCED\" AND MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON.  THE VEHICLE THEN DECELERATES TO 10-20 MPH.  THIS HAS OCCURRED TO ME TWICE WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY TRAVELLING IN EXCESS OF 60 MPH.(NOT WHILE ACCELERATING).   THIS HAS OCCURRED WHILE ACCELERATING FROM 0 MPH, 30+ MPH, 60+ PMH AND DECELERATING FROM 60+MPH, 30+MPH AND FROM 0 TO 30 MPH.  IT HAS OCCURRED WHILE TURNING A CORNER, DRIVING IN A STRAIGHT LINE.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID TO BRING THE VEHICLE IN AFTER AN INCIDENT WITHOUT TURNING OFF THE VEHICLE.  I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE WITHOUT EVER HAVING TO STOP AND TURN OFF THE VEHICLE.  THE POWER STEERING IS ALMOST NON-EXISTENT AFTER REDUCED ENGINE POWER OCCURS.  IT FEELS LIKE IT IS RUNNING ON THREE OF THE SIX CYLINDERS AND HAS ALMOST CAUSED ME TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT.  I ALMOST HIT A SCHOOL BUS ONCE.  THE VEHICLE IS AT THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN FOR IT'S SECOND WEEK OF DIAGNOSTICS.",
