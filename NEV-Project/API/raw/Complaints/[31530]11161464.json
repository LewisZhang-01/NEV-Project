I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER ONTO THE SHOULDER BEFORE THE STEERING LOCKED UP.  I HAD NO IDEA WHAT HAD JUST HAPPENED.  AFTER AWHILE I DISCOVERED THE CAR WOULD RESTART AND DROVE THE REMAINING 20 MILES HOME WITH NO PROBLEM.  IT WASN'T UNTIL I CALLED THE DEALER THE NEXT DAY AND LOOKED ONLINE THAT I REALIZED WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I'M SHORT , 5'1' AND HAD THE STEERING COLUMN AT THE LOWEST POSITION AND THE SEAT FORWARD.  I'VE MOVED THE COLUMN TO THE NEXT SETTING HIGHER AND BELIEVE THIS PROBLEM IS NOW UNLIKELY TO RECUR.  THE LOWEST COLUMN POSITION SHOULD BE ELIMINATED .  DANGEROUS!!",
