MY SIGNIFICANT OTHER CAME HOME FROM WORK ON 9/27/18 AND CHANGED PADS, LUBED CALIPER SLIDERS, AND VERIFIED PROPER CALIPER OPERATION. SPENT 9/26/18 TALKING WITH THE DEALER AND CHECKING RECALLS. ALL THESE REPAIRS WERE SUGGESTED BY THE LOCAL DEALER, BY THEM OF COURSE. UPON TEST DRIVE AFTER NEW PADS WERE INSTALLED, THE SAME ISSUE HAPPENED. DRIVING FORWARD THE BRAKES OPERATE AS THEY SHOULD OR AT LEAST FEEL NORMAL.",
