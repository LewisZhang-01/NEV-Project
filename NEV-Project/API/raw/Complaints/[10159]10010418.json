I AM AFRAID THESE PARTS WILL RUST THROUGH AND CAUSE LOSS OF STEERING.  IF THE TIE RODS RUST THROUGH, YOU WILL HAVE NO STEERING.  IF THE SPINDLE RUSTS THROUGH, YOU WILL LOSE A WHEEL.  EITHER OF THESE SCENARIOS CAN KILL.  THE INSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR SEEMS TO BE SMALLER THAN NORMAL.  IT DOES NOT PROVIDE FULL COVERAGE OF A REAR VIEW.  DOES THIS MIRROR MEET LEGAL REQUIREMENTS?  THE REAR SEAT HAS NO HEAD RESTRAINTS.  I THOUGHT TRUCKS WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE REAR SEAT HEAD RESTRAINTS AFTER MODEL YEAR 1990.  AM I WRONG ON THIS?  *JB",
