        "summary": "OUR FORD FUSION ENGINE SUDDENLY STARTED DYING IN TRAFFIC. WHEN STOPPING AT A LIGHT OR STOP SIGN IN TRAFFIC, THE IDLE WOULD DROP BELOW 5000 RPMS, THEN SUDDENLY THE ENGINE WOULD DIE. AFTER PLACING THE VEHICLE IN PARK, WE WOULD HAVE TO RESTART THE ENGINE. USUALLY WOULD DIE AFTER SITTING STILL AFTER ABOUT 10 SECONDS. SOMETIMES THE VEHICLE WOULDN'T START BACKUP RIGHT AWAY, SO WE WERE STUCK ON THE ROAD UNTIL IT FINALLY DECIDED TO START. NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT OR WRENCH WOULD DISPLAY. WE TOOK IT IN TO FORD DEALER AND THEY DETERMINED THE THROTTLE BODY WAS DEFECTIVE. APPARENTLY THIS IS AN ISSUE WITH MOST FORD FUSIONS, AS WELL AS OTHER MODELS THAT USE THE SAME THROTTLE BODY. THE VEHICLE HAS 80,000 MILES ON IT. REPAIR COSTS WERE OVER $1000. WHEN IS FORD GOING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE FOR THE FUSIONS THAT WERE MADE BEFORE 2009?  THANKS,  [XXX]  'INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).' *BF",
