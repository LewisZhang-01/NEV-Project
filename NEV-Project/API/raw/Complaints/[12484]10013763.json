IF IT HAPPENS WHILE TRYING TO PULL INTO TRAFFIC  A SERIOUS ACCIDENT COULD RESULT. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TO FIX THE PROBLEM BUT  THE REAL CONCERN IS TO HAVE A COMPUTER ABLE TO CONTROL THE ENGINE SPEED IS DANGEROUS. AT ANY TIME IT COULD REDUCE ENGINE POWER WITHOUT THE DRIVER  HAVING ANY CONTROL.*JB",
