IF YOU TRY TO FUEL THE CAR AT ANY SPEED OF THE GAS PUMP, GASOLINE SPITS BACK AT TREMENDOUS PRESSURE. IT COVERS THE CAR, THE FUELING PERSON AND FORD IS NOT LETTING THIS SECRET OUT TO THE PUBLIC. I TALKED TO TWO MECHANICS AT THE DEALERSHIP MY CAR IS IN (THE CAR HAS BEEN THERE FOR A MONTH, THIS TIME) AND THEY SAID IT'S A FACTORY DEFECT CAUSED BY TWO CANISTERS THAT ARE TO KEEP RAIN AND FEUL OUT. THIS IS A DANGEROUS CONDITION!!!!!!!!!!! I'VE SEEN PEOPLE WITH CIGARETTES IN THEIR HAND WHILE REFUELING. IF THIS HAPPENS TO THEM THEY ARE GOING TO DIE BECAUSE OF THE AMOUT OF FUEL THAT SPITS BACK. I'VE FILED FOR THE LEMON LAW BECAUSE I DON'T WANT A CAR THAT DOES THIS BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ADDRESSING THE ISSUE ONLY REPLACING THE SAME PART.*JB",
