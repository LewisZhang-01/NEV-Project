AS OF TODAY MY VEHICLE IS IN THE SHOP;I WAS DOING 35-40 MPH WHEN VEHICLE JUST UN EXPECTEDLY SHUT OFF. I WAS STRANDED ON A MAJOR ROAD WHICH CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT TRAFFIC DELAY. I HAVE AN OIL LEAK FROM THE HOSE LEADING TO MY OIL FILTER AND THE VEHICLE PULL TO THE RIGHT SHARPLY IF I RELEASE THE STEERING WHEEL. THE VEHICLE MAKES A POPPING SOUND WHEN TURNING. THESE PROBLEMS ARE HARD TO FIND JUST AN ISOLATED INCIDENT WHEN SO MANY CONSUMERS ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS.   *NLM",
