        "summary": "ON MARCH 10, 2006 MY FIANCE WAS ON HER WAY HOME FROM WORK. SHE HAD JUST STARTED MOVING WHEN A STOP LIGHT TURNED GREEN. ABOUT 150 FEET DOWN THE ROAD FROM THE STOP LIGHT THE TRAFFIC CAME TO A STOP BECAUSE OF A TRAFFIC JAM. WHEN MY FIANCE APPLIED THE BRAKES THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND THE CAR HAD NO BRAKES WHAT-SO-EVER. SHE REAR-ENDED A FORD ESCORT THAT WAS IN FRONT OF HER. WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES TO THE FACT THAT 15 MINUTES AFTER THE ACCIDENT, THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS STILL ON THE FLOOR. WHEN THE POLICE ARRIVED, THE OFFICER WOULDN'T EVEN PUSH THE CAR OFF OF THE ROAD WHEN WE TOLD HIM THAT IT HAD NO BRAKES. WE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL A TOW TRUCK MOVED THE CAR FROM THE ROAD SURFACE. I AM NOW FACING AN INSURANCE CLAIM FORM MY CAR AND THE OTHER CAR DUE TO A FAILURE IN THE BRAKE SYSTEM. THE CAR IS BEING TOWED TO THE BODY SHOP ON MARCH 13, 2006 WHERE I AM GOING TO TELL THEM ABOUT THE BRAKES. ONCE THE CAR IS REPAIRED I WILL THEM TAKE IT TO THE CHRYSLER DEALER AND HAVE THEM DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO THE BRAKES TO SEE WHY THE FAILURE HAPPENED. MY CAR IS A 2004 CHRYSLER 300M PLATINUM SERIES. *JB",
