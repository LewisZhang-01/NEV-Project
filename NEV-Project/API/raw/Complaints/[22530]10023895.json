        "summary": "AFTER 25000 MILES, THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD SHAKE VIOLENTLY WHEN BRAKING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER. THE DEALER FOUND THAT THE ROTORS WERE WARPED. THE DEALER ASKED IF I DID A LOT OF STOP AND GO DRIVING. I EXPLAINED THAT I DRIVE 4 MILES TO THE FREEWAY, 75 MILES ON THE FREEWAY AT 4:30AM, BARELY ANY TRAFFIC, AND THEN 2 MILES TO THE BUILDING IN WHICH I WORK. SO NO, I DO NOT DRIVE IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC.  THE DEALER DID NOT WANT TO COVER THE ROTORS UNDER THE 3/36 WARRANTY, HE SAID THAT THE BRAKES WERE NOT COVERED. I EXPLAINED THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT BRAKE PADS WERE NOT COVERED, BUT THAT THE BRAKE ROTORS ARE NOT A CONSUMABLE ITEMS. AFTER 3 DAYS OF ARGUING WITH THE DEALER, THEY FINALLY REPLACED THE ROTORS UNDER WARRANTY.  25000 MILES LATER, I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. THEY ARE REPLACING THESE ROTORS FOR FREE.  SOMEONE SHOULD LOOK THE ROTORS ON THE 2002 FORD RANGER XLT EXTENDED CAB 4 DR.  *JB",
