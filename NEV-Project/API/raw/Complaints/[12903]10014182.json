MY DAUGHTER WAS IN THE SECOND ROW OF THE MINIVAN WITH THE RIGHT-SIDE CAPTAINS CHAIR MOVED OVER TO CONFIGURE THE ROW INTO A BENCH.  THE SEAT BELT, HOWEVER WAS STILL ATTACHED OVER BY THE DOOR WITH NO OTHER ATTACHMENT AVAILABLE, SO THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN THE SEAT AND WHERE THE SEAT BELT IS ATTACHED.  MY DAUGHTER WAS PROPERLY BUCKLED IN, AND SHE IS 105 LBS. AND ALMOST 5 FEET TALL.  HOWEVER, WHEN WE WERE HIT FROM THE SIDE, SHE SLID RIGHT OFF THE SEAT AND ONTO THE FLOOR BETWEEN THE SEAT AND THE DOOR WITH THE BUCKLE STILL AROUND HER.  IN ADDITION, MY SEAT BELT (DRIVER'S) FAILED TO RESTRAIN ME.  IT PULLED ALL THE WAY OUT. *JB",
