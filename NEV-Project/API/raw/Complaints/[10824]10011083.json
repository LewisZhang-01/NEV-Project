WHEN MY INFANT IS IN THE SEAT, HE IS BENT IN HALF, HIS FOREHEAD IS TOUCHING HIS SHINS, AND ANYWAY THAT I MOVE IT, IS NO BETTER.  WHAT WERE TO HAPPEN IF WE WERE IN AN ACCIDENT?  HIS HEAD WOULD SNAP, THERE IS NOTHING HOLDING IT IN PLACE AND HE CAN NOT, BECAUSE HE IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO YET.  THERE IS NO SUPPORT AND THE SEAT IS NOT SAFE.  I REFUSE TO USE THIS CAR SEAT, AND IN ITS PLACE I HAD TO BUY A BETTER ONE, AND SPEND A LOT OF MONEY.  THESE CAR SEATS SHOULD ALL BE RECALLED, AND UNTIL A BETTER ONE IS MADE I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER GRACO PRODUCT AGAIN.  ALSO, THE CAR SEAT DOES NOT SIT IN THE SEAT BELT CORRECTLY EITHER, I TOOK A TURN AT ABOUT 3 MPH AND THE WHOLE SEAT TIPPED OVER WITH MY INFANT IN IT.  THANK THE GOOD LORD THAT HE WAS NOT INJURED.  *JB",
