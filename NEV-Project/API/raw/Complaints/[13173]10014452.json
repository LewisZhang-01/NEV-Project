IT OCCURS AT NO CERTAIN TIME OR CIRCUMSTANCE, JUST EVERYDAY AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER.  THE SMELL GIVES ME HEADACHES AND FORCES ME TO ROLL MY WINDOW DOWN WHETHER ITS COLD, HOT, OR RAINY OUTSIDE JUST TO PROVIDE ME WITH SOME RELIEF.  THE DEALERSHIP, HENDRICK ACURA IN CHARLOTTE, NC HAS REPLACED MY CATALYTIC CONVERTER TWICE.  BOTH TIMES THEY ASSURED ME I WOULDN'T SMELL ANYTHING AGAIN.  HOWEVER, THEY WERE WRONG.  ACURA'S CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE TELL ME ITS JUST A NORMAL BY-PRODUCT OF THE ENGINE AND THAT THERE'S NOTHING TO FIX THE PROBLEM.   *NLM",
