DEALERSHIP WAS ABLE TO FINISH MY SENTENCE WHEN FIRST ATTEMPTING TO DESCRIBE THE PROBLEM & VOLUNTEERED TO REPLACE THE DRIVESHAFT, WHICH DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  SERVICE TECHS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT REPLACING THE DRIVESHAFT DOESNT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. RETURNED TRUCK AGAIN, DEALERSHIP KEPT TRUCK FOR 10 DAYS WITHOUT ONE WORD, DID NOTHING AND THEN SAID THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. SENT LETTER TO MANUFACTURER WHO IS PUSHING ARBITRATION THRU NCDS.   BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS, I HAVE NO FAITH THE LEXUS WILL ACCEPT REPONSIBILITY FOR THIS DEFECT FOR WHICH THEY ARE FULLY AWARE OF. *AK",
