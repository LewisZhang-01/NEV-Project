BASED ON RESEARCH CONDUCTED, AND SIMILAR ISSUES FOUND DURING THE RESEARCH, ALL SIGNS POINT TO THE TOTALLY INTEGRATED POWER MODULE.  THIS IS COMPLETELY UNSAFE AND I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS PART ISN'T WEATHER PROOF WHEN IT CONTROLS SO MANY VITAL PARTS OF THE VEHICLE.  WITH ALL THE ISSUES I'M ALSO SHOCKED TO KNOW THERE HASN'T BEEN A RECALL ON THIS PRODUCT.  THIS SAME STYLE PRODUCT IS USED IN MULTIPLE DODGE VEHICLES AND OTHER CHRYSLER / JEEP VEHICLES.  THOSE VEHICLES ALSO EXHIBIT THE SAME ISSUE.",
