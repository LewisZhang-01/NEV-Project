THE MALIBU HAS ELECTRONIC STEERING SO THERE IS NO WARNING WHEN THE STEERING IS ABOUT TO FAIL LIKE WITH A NORMAL POWER STEERING PUMP. I CHECKED SOME CONNECTIONS AND THOUGHT I HAD IT FIXED BECAUSE IT WORKED WHEN I STARTED THE CAR AGAIN. A FEW WEEKS LATER I WAS IN THE CITY AND THE STEERING QUIT WORKING AGAIN IF I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD A GOOD HOLD ON THE STEERING WHEEL WHEN I WAS TURNING I COULD HAVE EASILY RAN INTO SOMEONE OR EVEN WORSE HIT A PEDESTRIAN! THIS PROBLEM IS WELL DOCUMENTED IN MALIBU'S OF THIS AGE AND A COMMON PROBLEM. IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THIS CAUSES A DEATH IF IT HASN'T ALREADY!  *TR",
