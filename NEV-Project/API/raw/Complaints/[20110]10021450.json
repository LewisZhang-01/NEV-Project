        "summary": "THE DISTANCE IN WHICH VEHICLE NEEDS TO STOP IS LONGER THAN OTHER SIMILAR VEHICLES.  IT IS MOST NOTICEABLE IN MODERATE TO HARD BRAKING.  WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED, THE PEDAL FEEL IS AVERAGE BUT THE BRAKES DO NOT SEEM TO GRAB AND STOP THE VEHICLE AS IT SHOULD.  I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS CLOSE ACCIDENTS DUE TO POOR BRAKING.  THE BRAKES DO NOT LOCK-UP ON THE VEHICLE, NOT EVEN TO THE POINT WHERE ABS WILL NEED TO RELEASE THE REAR WHEELS.  I HAVE COMPLETELY REPLACED ALL BRAKE COMPONENTS AND HAS NOT IMPROVED AT ALL!!  AS WELL AS SPEND HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON DIAGNOSTICS WORK WITH NO ANSWER AS TO THE CAUSE (BUT THE DEALER DOES KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM)!!  THIS IS NOT THE FAULT OF THE DEALER, THEY HAVE BEEN FAIR, BUT HAVE RUN OUT OF PLACES TO LOOK.  THEY HAVE CALLED CHRYSLER STAR HOTLINE, ETC. BUT STILL NO RESOLVE.  IF ANYONE HAS A FIX FOR THIS OR A COURSE OF ACTION TO TAKE, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!  I LOVE THE TRUCK, BUT IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO DRIVE.   *JB",
