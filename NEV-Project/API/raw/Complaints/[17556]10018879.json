PROBLEM 1-- MY JEEP ONLY HAS 44000 MILES ON IT NOW AND MY BRAKE ROTORS ARE WARPED.  PROBLEM 2--THIS MAY SOUND FUNNY BUT ITS TRUE. THE 1998 JEEP GRAND I HAVE HAS ITS SPARE TIRE INSIDE COMPARTMENT ABOVE FUEL TANK. THIS PAST WINTER I TRIED TO REMOVE MY SPARE AND FOUND THAT DUE TO CONDENSATION IT WAS FROZEN TO THE COMPARTMENT.  ALTHOUGH I DID NOT NEED IT AT THAT TIME I THOUGHT THAT WAS STRANGE. WELL IT JUST SO HAPPENS I HAD TO USE MY SPARE TIRE ON 5/16/03, WHEN I REMOVED THE SPARE FROM THE COMPARTMENT THERE WAS ABOUT 1 GALLON OF WATER SITTING AROUND THE SPARE.  I HAVE NO LEAKS AND WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF IT IS A DESIGN DEFECT OR WHAT CAN I DO TO GET RID OF THE CONDENSATION BUILD UP.  *JB",
