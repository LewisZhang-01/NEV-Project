        "summary": "DEPARTED EUREKA, CA AT 1600 IN HEAVY RAIN ON FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 20, 2013.  EUREKA TO REDDING CA ON HIGHWAY 299.  RAIN WAS HEAVY FOR ABOUT 100 MILES NORTHBOUND ON HIGHWAY 299.  AT ABOUT THE 100 MILE MARK, I ATTEMPTED TO PASS ANOTHER VEHICLE (SUDDEN ACCELERATION) WHEN THE ENGINE BEGAN TO RAPIDLY LOSE POWER AND THE TRUCK STARTED TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY AND SHUDDER.  THE ENGINE LIGHT ON THE DASH BEGAN TO FLASH.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A FLAT TIRE.  BECAUSE I WAS IN \"THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE\" I CONTINUED ON TOWARDS WEAVERVILLE.  I WAS CLIMBING A STEEP HILL, SLOWLY AND THE TRUCK CONTINUED TO SHAKE AND SHUDDER FOR ABOUT 6 MILES UNTIL I GOT TO THE TOP OF OREGON HILL (SUMMIT).  WHEN I REACHED THE TOP, I PUT THE TRUCK IN NEUTRAL AND CAREFULLY COASTED DOWN THE HILL.  WITHIN 2 MILES (OF COASTING AND THE ROAD IS DRY NOW) THE FLASHING ENGINE LIGHT WENT OFF AND THE TRUCK APPEARED TO RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATION.  AFTER THIS, I CONTINUED MY TRAVEL TO RENO, NEVADA AND HAD NO FURTHER PROBLEMS.  THE TRUCK IS RUNNING FINE RIGHT NOW.  *JS",
