I WAS ON THE ROAD GOING ABOUT 35 MILES PER HOUR AND THE CAR WANTED TO SHIFT INTO THIRD GEAR, BUT THE TRANSMISSION FAILED RESULTING IN MY RPMS TO REDLINE. THE CAR STARTED BUCKLING VIOLENTLY; LUCKLY I WASN'T GOING VERY FAST, BUT I DID SWERVE INTO THE OTHER LANE PARTLY DUE TO THE BUCKLING OF THE CAR. I WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT HOME ALBEIT VERY SLOW AND ONLY IN THIRD GEAR WITH MY HAZZARDS ON. HAD THE CAR TOWED THE NEXT DAY TO THE DEALER (RICK CASE ACURA) AND THEY ARE CURRENTLY REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION. I WILL BE SELLING THIS CAR BECAUSE I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE. IMAGINE IF THIS HAD HAPPENED WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY.",
