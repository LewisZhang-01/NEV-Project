UPON CLOSER INSPECTION I DISCOVERED THAT IN AT LEAST ONE LOCATION THERE IS HOLES IN THE FRAME WERE IT HAS ROTTED THROUGH. I HAVE ALSO INSPECTED THE INTERIOR OF THE FRAME MEMBERS AND HAVE DISCOVERED LARGE AMOUNTS OF RUSTED METAL THAT HAS FALLEN OF THE INSIDE OF THE FRAME. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE FRAME OF THIS 6 YEAR OLD VEHICLE WITH 71,000 MILES ON IT IS ROTTING FROM THE INSIDE AND THE OUTSIDE. I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS IS INDEED A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  *TR",
