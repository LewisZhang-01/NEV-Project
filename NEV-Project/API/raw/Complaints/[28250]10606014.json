THERE WAS JUST ABOUT $10,000 WORTH OF DAMAGE TO MY CAR. AFTER WAITING A MONTH AND A HALF, TRAVELING 18 HOURS & SPENDING AN EXTRA $200 FOR TRAVEL TO GO GET MY CAR I FINALLY GOT IT BACK.     ALSO, MY CAR DOES NOT IDLE LIKE IT SHOULD. IT WILL ALSO GO DEAD WHEN I COME TO A STOP. IT DOESN'T HAPPEN ALL THE TIME BUT IT WILL HAPPEN IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC AND I WILL BE STUCK THERE FOR A FEW MINUTES.   *TR",
