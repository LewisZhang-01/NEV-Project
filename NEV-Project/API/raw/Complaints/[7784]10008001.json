HE CLEANED IT UP AND AGIN THE NEXT DAY, A FEW MORE DROPS.  HE CHECKED THE HOSE CLAMPS AND HOSE CONDITIONS, THEY WERE FINE.  HE CHECKED THE RESERVOIR WHERE YOU PUT IN DEXCOOL, IT WAS DRY.  HE FILLED THE RESERVIOR AND DROVE THE CAR IMMEDIATELY TO OUR LOCAL MECHANIC SO WE WOULD NOT DO ANY ENGINE DAMAGE.  AFTER 2 DAYS AND $800, THE CAR HAS BEEN FIXED.  NOW I NOTICE WHEN SEARCHING THE WEB, THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF REPORTS VERY SIMILAR TO MINE.  UNFORTUNATELY, I ALSO NOTICED MANY WHERE THERE WERE FIRES OR ACCIDENTS.  GM HAS TO FIX THIS AND AT LEAST PARTIALLY REIMBURSE THOSE LIKE ME WHO HAVE HAD TO PAY MAJOR REPAIR BILLS.",
