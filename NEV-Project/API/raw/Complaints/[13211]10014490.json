THE IGNITION WOULD NOT TURN AND THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD NOT TURN EVEN THOUGH SHE TRIED WITH ALL HER STRENGTH. SHE REQUESTED ANOTHER PARENT (MALE) TO HELP. HE TURNED THE STEERING WHEEL WITH FORCE AND THE IGNITION TURNED. HE SAID HE WAS SURPRISED BECAUSE HER WHEELS WERE NOT TURNED. HE SAID THIS NORMALLY HAPPENS IF THE WHEELS ARE IN THE TURNED POSITION WHEN PARKING, BUT THEY WERE NOT. GOOD THING THE TEMPERATURE WAS NOT 40 BELOW ZERO AS THEY CAN BE HERE. IS THIS A KNOWN PROBLEM ? IS THERE A FIX ?  *NLM",
