        "summary": "A LITTLE OVER A MONTH AGO THE LEFT REAR TOE LINK BROKE WHILE DRIVING. THIS CAUSED THE CAR TO LOSE CONTROL AND GO INTO A SIDEWAYS SLIDE, BREAKING THE WHEEL HUB IN THE PROCESS. SMOOTH ROAD GOING ABOUT 50 MPH IN GOOD CONDITIONS. WE GOT THE CAR FIXED AND HAD TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS SINCE THE CAR IS NO LONGER UNDER FACTORY WARRANTY.  AFTER THE FORD DEALER IN MCHENRY IL HAD IT FOR OVER A WEEK, WE GOT THE CAR BACK, DROVE IT FOR A FEW DAYS AND SUDDENLY WE HAD A CRACKED EXHAUST FLEX PIPE. WE HAD TO PAY SEVERAL HUNDRED MORE TO GET THAT REPAIRED. AGAIN, DRIVEN ON SMOOTH ROADS IN THE SUMMER, NOTHING THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED THIS SO SUDDENLY.  GOT THE CAR BACK AGAIN AFTER SEVERAL MORE DAYS IN THE SHOP.. DROVE IT FOR A COUPLE MORE DAYS AND THE LEFT REAR TOE LINK BROKE.. AGAIN... DEALER THIS TIME INSTALLED THE \"RECALL KIT\" ON BOTH SIDES.  LUCKILY, THIS TIME IT WAS AT SLOW SPEEDS COMING INTO A PARKING LOT . HAD THE CAR TOWED BACK TO THE DEALER.  AGAIN..  WE HAVE HAD THE CAR BACK FOR ABOUT 3 DAYS NOW, AND THE LEFT TOE LINK HAS COME LOOSE..  AGAIN.. THE CAR WILL BE TOWED BACK TO THE DEALER TOMORROW BECAUSE IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE. IT WAS DRIVEN 3 TIMES AT LOW SPEEDS AROUND TOWN SINCE WE GOT IT BACK.     MY WIFE IS NOW AFRAID TO DRIVE THE CAR OUT OF FEAR OF IT BREAKING AGAIN.    THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE IF THE RECALL PART DOESN'T WORK. WHEN THIS PART FAILS, THIS CAR HAS A SEVERE LOSS OF CONTROL AND CAN VERY EASILY RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT.   FORD NEEDS TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED.",
