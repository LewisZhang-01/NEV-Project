THIS PROBLEM ONLY SEEMS TO OCCUR WHEN I AM GOING DOWNHILL (LIKE LOVELAND PASS).  THE SHUTTERING DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE SPEED OF DECELERATION. ONCE IT STARTS IT SEEM TO BE THERE UNTIL THE BRAKES HAVE PLENTY OF COOLING TIME.  I HAD IT INTO THE DEALER AND THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT OR GET IT TO DO IT.  HOWEVER LAST TIME I WAS IN FOR OTHER REPAIRS, THE SERVICE MANAGER MENTIONED THAT 2000-2003 TUNDRA'S HAD A SERVICE BULLETIN FOR A SIMILAR PROBLEM BUT THERE WAS NOT ONE FOR THE TACOMA.  I TRIED TO LOOK UP INFORMATION TO SEE IF THE BRAKING SYSTEMS CONSISTED OF THE SAME COMPONENTS, BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. *JB",
