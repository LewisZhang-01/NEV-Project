I WAS IN 4TH GEAR AT THE TIME.  I TRIED TO SWITCH GEARS AND WAS UNABLE TO PUT IT INTO ANY GEAR AND WAS STUCK COASTING IN NEUTRAL.  I STOPPED THE CAR AND WAS AGAIN UNABLE TO PUT THE CAR INTO ANY GEAR WHILE THE ENGINE WAS ON.  I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE, PUT THE CAR INTO SECOND GEAR AND RESTARTED IT  AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE TO SAFETY IN 2ND GEAR  TO A GAS STATION A MILE DOWN THE STREET BEFORE THE CAR GAVE A PUFF OF BLACK SMOKE FROM THE TAILPIPE AND WOULD NO LONGER DRIVE.  THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND I WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS A WEAR ITEM - AND THAT MY CLUTCH WAS BURNED UP.  THIS WAS NOT A WARN OUT/BURNED OUT CLUTCH BUT I COULD NOT PROVE IT.  1200.00 WORTH OF REPAIRS FOR SOMETHING THAT I AM POSITIVE WAS NOT MY FAULT.  *TR",
