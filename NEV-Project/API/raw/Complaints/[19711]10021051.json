CAR CONSUMES OIL AT A RAPID RATE OF 2 QUARTS PER 1200 MILES. TRIED AN INFORMAL RESOLUTION AND NISSAN REJECTED. DEALER AGREES THE CAR SHOULD BE BOUGHT BACK. SYMPTOMS THAT I HAVE, LEAD TO POSSIBLE ENGINE FIRE AND IS BEING ADDRESSED WITH A RECALL. I WAS SENT HOME IN A VEHICLE THAT WAS UNSAFE AND THEY DID NOT WANT TO FIX THIS LAST TIME AND WERE DENYING THE CAR HAD ANY PROBLEM. I FOUGHT A LONG HARD BATTLE JUST TO GET IT FIXED.   *NLM",
