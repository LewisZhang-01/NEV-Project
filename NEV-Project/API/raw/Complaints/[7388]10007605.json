I HAVE REPLACED 2 POWER STEERING PUMPS, AND A POWER STEERING RACK WITHIN THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF OWNING THE VEHICLE.  WITH THE POWER STEERING PUMP GOING OUT, AN ACCIDENT COULD HAVE BEEN CAUSED.  I KNOW SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE THAT THE PUMP HAD WENT OUT ON THEM, AND ALSO HAD IT REPLACED.  I CONTACTED PONTIAC, AND THEY WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  THEY SAID SINCE MY VEHICLE WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY, THAT THEY WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING.  THE FIRST REPAIR WAS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY, THE SECOND WAS NOT.  THE RACK WAS ALSO NOT UNDER WARRANTY.",
