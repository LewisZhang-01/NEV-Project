        "summary": "WE BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER AROUND WITH ABOUT 10,000 MILES ON MAY 2018 STATING WE SMELLED EXHAUST FUMES INSIDE THE VEHICLE.  THEY PUT SOME TYPE OF RUBBER PLUGS IN THE LIFT GATE REAR HATCH.   THIS DIDN'T CURE THE PROBLEM.  BROUGHT THE VEHICLE BACK ON AUGUST 21, 2018 WITH 13,800 MILES AND TOLD THEM WHEN WE TRIED TO ENTER A FREEWAY WHILE ACCELERATING INTO TRAFFIC  WITH THE A/C ON THERE IS A VERY PROFOUND ODOR OF EXHAUST FUMES INSIDE THE VEHICLE.  THEY STATED THERE WAS A TSB ISSUED FOR THIS VEHICLE BACK IN 2016 FOR THIS ISSUE.  BUT UNFORTUNATELY EVEN THOUGH THE CAR ONLY HAS 13,800 MILES ON IT NOW, IT IS OVER THE 3 YEAR WARRANTY PERIOD AND THE EXTENDED WARRANTY WE PURCHASED FROM THEM FOR 50,000 OR FIVE YEARS WON'T COVER IT EITHER. DEALER WANTS TO CHARGE US 1,100 FOR THE REPAIRS. WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED EARLIER IF WE WERE TOLD BACK IN 2016 THERE WAS A TSB FOR THIS PROBLEM  WHILE IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.  THIS CAR MAY BE FIVE YEARS OLD BUT IT ONLY HAD 10,000 MILES WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT IN THE FIRST TIME.  CAR IS JUST ABOUT BRAND NEW AND THEY WANT US TO PAY FOR REPAIRS ON A NEW VEHICLE THAT HAS A DEFECTIVE EXHAUST SYSTEM.",
