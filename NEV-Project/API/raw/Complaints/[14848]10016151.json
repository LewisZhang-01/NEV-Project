AFTER PLACING IT ON THEIR COMPUTER, I WAS TOLD THE VEHICLES' CAM SENSOR NEEDED REPLACED.  I ALSO HAD THE MECHANIC CHANGE THE SPARK PLUGS.  BOTH OF WHICH HAD TO BE ORDERED THROUGH THE DEALER.  $200 DOLLARS LATER, I PICKED THE VEHICLE UP AND DROVE APPROX. 5 MILES BEFORE THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN.  I TOOK IT BACK TO THE GARAGE WHO ADVISED ME THAT I SHOULD HAVE THE DEALERSHIP LOOK INTO IT.  ONCE AT THE DEALERSHIP, I WAS TOLD I NEED A CRANK SENSOR.  ANOTHER $200 DOLLARS LATER, MY WIFE PICKED THE VEHICLE UP, DROVE IT NO MORE THAN 2 BLOCKS FROM THE DEALERSHIP WHERE IT STALLED ON HER AND MY TWO CHILDREN IN THE MIDDLE OF US 52 IN OHIO.  NOW, AFTER NOT HAVING MY VEHICLE FOR ALMOST A MONTH, I AM TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THE TIMING CHAIN MIGHT NEED REPLACED WHICH WILL EASILY COST $300 LABOR FOR 6HR OF WORK, AND AT LEAST $200 FOR THE NEW TIMING CHAIN.  IN LESS THAN A MONTH I WILL HAVE SPENT AT LEAST $900 ON A PROBLEM YET TO BE ACTUALLY VERIFIED AS THE PROBLEM NEEDING FIXED.   *NLM",
