        "summary": "ON JUNE 26, 2003, MY WIFE CALLED ME STATING SHE COULD NOT GET OUR 2000 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE TO LOCK INTO PARK. THE SHIFTER WOULD GO INTO PARK, AS WELL AS THE TRANSMISSION, BUT THE SHIFTER BUTTON WAS IN A BIND (ACTUALLY THE RUBBER PIECE ON THE SHIFTER BUTTON HAD COME OFF AND LODGED IN BETWEEN THE SHIFTER STALK AND THE BUTTON). THIS IN EFFECT HELD THE BUTTON IN, NOT LOCKING THE SHIFTER INTO PARK. I FEEL THE ONLY REASON SHE KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG WAS THE FACT THAT SHE COULD NOT REMOVE THE KEYS FROM THE IGNITION. I SIMPLY TOLD HER TO PUT THE TRANSMISSION IN NEUTRAL AND ENGAGE THE PARKING BRAKE, BUT HAD SHE EXITED THE CAR WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING, THE SHIFTER WOULD HAVE VERY EASILY MOVED INTO ANY DRIVE GEAR WHICH COULD RESULT IN 1) VEHICLE DAMAGE, AND 2) GRAVE BODILY INJURY. WE LOVE THE JEEP, BUT FEEL THIS ISSUE IS HIGHLY UNSAFE.*AK",
