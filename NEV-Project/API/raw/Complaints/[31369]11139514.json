IT'S SO BAD THAT THE MECHANIC ISN'T SURE HE CAN ACTUALLY FIX IT. I FOUND OUT THAT THIS IS SO COMMON THAT CHRYSLER EXTENDED WARRANTIES FOR EVERYONE, BUT DIDN'T OFFER A RECALL. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THEY ONLY OFFERED THIS FOR A SET TIME OF 120 MONTHS. YOU WOULD THINK THEY WOULD HAVE NOTIFIED PEOPLE OF THIS SO THEY COULD HAVE IT REPAIRED. INSTEAD, THOSE OF US WHO HAPPEN TO HAVE AN INCIDENT AFTER THE TIME FRAME ARE NOW OUT OF LUCK AND OUT OF A LOT OF MONEY TO (HOPEFULLY) REPAIR THE PROBLEM. DISAPPOINTING TO SAY THE VERY LEAST.",
