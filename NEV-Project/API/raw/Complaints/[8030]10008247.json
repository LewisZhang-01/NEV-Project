ABOUT 1/2 YEAR LATER THE SAME THING HAPPENED. HAD IT TOWED TO AUTO SHOP, THEY COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM AND TOLD ME TO CALL THEM IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN. THEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN LATE 2002 AND I TOOK THE CAR TO ANOTHER AUTO SHOP. THEY COULD NOT EXPLAIN THE REASON EITHER - EVERYTHING SEEMED FINE AND AFTER A WHILE IT STARTED AGAIN AND WAS RUNNING NORMALLY. IT HAPPENED AGAIN LATE JANUARY 2003 AND THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE LATTER AUTO SHOP. THEY REPLACED FUEL PUMP AND TOLD ME EVERYTHING SHOULD BE FINE. LATE FEBRUARY 2003 THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. THE CAR IS AT THE AUTO SHOP - THEY ARE TRYING TO LOCATE THE PROBLEM. ON AND OFF IT WILL START. ALL CHECK DATES - EVERY 5000 MILES - HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED AND THE CAR HAS BEEN WELL TAKEN CARE OF AT ALL TIMES. NOW, I AM AFRAID OF DRIVING IT - BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT IS HAPPENING AGAIN. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, THAT AT SUCH LOW MILEAGE I HAVE TO FACE THIS PROBLEM. *JB",
