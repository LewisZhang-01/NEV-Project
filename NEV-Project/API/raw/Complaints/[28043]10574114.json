TOOK IT TO THE NEXT DEALER TWO DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND IT SEEMED TO BE FIXED. NOW IT'S DOING T AGAIN, 6K MILES LATER. AND NOW IT TENDS TO ROLL BACK ON EVEN SLIGHT HILLS. TODAY I WAS AT A RED LIGHT WITH TRAFFIC BEHIND ME. I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE ANTICIPATING THE LIGHT TO CHANGE. IT ROLLED BACK ABOUT 3-4 WHEN I THEN REAPPLIED THE BRAKES. I WAS LITERALLY A COUPLE INCHES FROM HITTING SOMEONE BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T STAY STILL EVEN IN DRIVE. SO I PRESSED THE GAS BEFORE I LET GO OF THE BRAKE TO ENSURE I WOULDN'T ROLL BACK MORE. WHEN I LET OFF THE BRAKE, THERE WAS A POP AND THE CAR JUMPED. NOT SAFE AND I'M NOW TRYING TO FIND OUT IF ANY LAWS WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO BUY IT BACK.  *TR",
