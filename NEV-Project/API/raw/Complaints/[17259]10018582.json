THE RSX IS VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO ROAD DEBRIS DAMAGING THE CONDENSER AND RADIATOR RENDERING THE CAR INOPERATIVE, DUE TO OVERHEATING AND RAPID LOSS OF RADIATOR FLUID. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  ACURA CONSIDERS THIS AN \"ACT OF GOD\" AND DOES NOT COVER THIS DAMAGE. MY SENSE IS THAT THIS IS VERY FAULTY MANUFACTURING. THE SERVICE MANAGERS RELATED TO ME THAT THERE HAS BEEN A \"NUMBER\" OF REPAIRS IN RECENT PAST, AND NOT JUST WITH THIS MODEL.  THE NHTSA IS REQUESTED TO FULLY EXPLORE THIS PROBLEM WITH ACURA.   *NLM",
