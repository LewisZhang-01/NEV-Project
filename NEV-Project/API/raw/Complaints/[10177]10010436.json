FORD SERVICE HAS REPEATEDLY (8 TIMES IN 2 YEARS) WORKED ON THE ISSUE ON MY TRUCK AS WELL AS OTHER OWNERS TRUCKS WITH WHOM I AM ACQUAINTED. THIS ENGINE FAILURE OCCURS APPROXIMATELY ONCE EVERY 10 MILES, AND IS VERY DANGEROUS WHEN TRYING TO ENTER A FREEWAY OR PASS ON A FM ROAD. I BELIEVE FORD DAMAGED THE ENGINE CONTROL UNIT WHEN THEY INSTALLED THEIR FORD AUTHORIZED POWER CHIP. THEY SEEM TO KEEP REPLACING LESS COSTLY COMPONENTS AND GIVING ME THE TRUCK BACK. I FEEL THEY ARE WAITING FOR MY TRUCK TO GET OUT OF THE WARRANTY PERIOD BEFORE THE REAL STORY IS TOLD. THAT WAY, I WILL BE OUT THE MONEY FOR WHAT EVER IS REALLY WRONG WITH THIS VEHICLES. OTHERS THAT I HAVE TALKED TO HAVE THE SAME ISSUE. PERHAPS ITS THE DEALERSHIP COVERING UP, BUT I WOULD NOT PUT IT PAST FORD TO BE BEHIND THIS.  *JB",
