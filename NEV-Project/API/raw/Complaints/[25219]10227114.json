        "summary": "2004 KIA SORENTO  LEAK IN A/C COOLANT BOTTLE.   MY CAR WAS IN FOR A PRESSURE TEST THREE WEEKS BEFORE THIS AND IT PAST JUST FINE WITHOUT ANY LEAKS OR CRACKS.  ON THE FREEWAY, OVER HEATS, PULL OVER, ALL THE FLUID LEAKS OUT, ENGINE IS DEAD AND MUST BE REPLACED.  JUST HIT 61,000 MILES.  KIA DOES NOT OFFER 100,000 MILE COVERAGE UNLESS YOU ARE THE ORIGINAL OWNER.   I AM THE SECOND OWNER AND HAVE HAD THE CAR THREE MONTHS.  $5000. LATER I HAVE MY CAR BACK.  KIA WILL NOT HONOR TO DO THE WORK BECAUSE THEY SAY IT WAS A LONG TERM LEAK.  WELL, BEFORE I PURCHASED THE CAR, KIA DID ALL THE MAINTENANCE ON THIS CAR FOR FOUR YEARS..... IF IT WAS A LONG TERM LEAK, SHOULDN'T THEY HAVE CAUGHT IT?  THEY SAY NO.  I ALSO PURCHASED AN EXTENDED 80,000/3 YEAR WARRANTY WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR, THEY ALSO DECLINED MY CAR COVERAGE BECAUSE THEY COVER NOTHING DUE TO ANY OVERHEATING.   THIS IS REALLY JUST A COMPLETE JOKE.  I DID NOTHING WRONG.  KIA SERVICED THE CAR FOR FOUR YEARS.  I HAD THE CAR IN THREE WEEKS BEFORE IT BLEW UP AND IT WAS TESTED AND FILLED WITH FLUIDS.  WHY DOES THIS NOT MAKE ANY SENSE???   *TR",
