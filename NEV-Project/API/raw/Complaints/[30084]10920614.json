I WILL BE GOING THE POSTED SPEED AND FOR NO APPARENT REASON, MY CAR WILL START TO DE-ACCELERATING ON ITS OWN.  AFTER READING SEVERAL COMPLAINTS I AM FINDING OUT THAT THIS IS DUE TO THE CVT TRANSMISSION IN THIS PARTICULAR MODEL.  THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD TO ANYONE WHO IS DRIVING THIS CAR.  ALSO, I HAVE NOTICED A LOUD NOISE WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN GEAR, WHICH I AM READING IS A SIGN THAT THE TRANSMISSION IS GOING OUT.  I PURCHASED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THIS VEHICLE BUT NONE OF THE REPAIRS THAT I HAVE LISTED ARE COVERED.  THIS CAR IS A PIECE OF JUNK AND I WILL NOT GET ANYTHING FOR IT UPON TRADE-IN.  I AM STUCK WITH THIS CAR, AND HAVE PUT OVER $3,000 IN THIS CAR ALREADY OVER THE LAST 6 MONTHS.  *TR",
