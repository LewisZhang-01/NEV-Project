AFTER THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER, THEY FIRST COMPLETED THE RECALL #01065 TO REPROGRAM THE TRANSFER CASE. WHEN THEY ROAD TESTED THE CAR THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE EARLIER COMPLAINT OF GRINDING METAL. THE SERVICE ADVISOR INDICATED THAT THE RECALL PROBABLY CORRECTED THE PROBLEM. MY QUESTION IS, WHAT DID ALL THAT METAL GRINDING NOISE DO TO THE LONGEVITY OF THE TRANSFER CASE, AND WHAT IF IT FAILS AFTER THE 3 YEAR, 36 MONTH WARRANTY?",
