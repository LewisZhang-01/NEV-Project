THE CRUISE CONTROL IMMEDIATELY DISENGAGES AND THE CAR SLOWS DOWN. THIS IS DANGEROUS WHEN GOING UP HILL AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. THERE ARE NO CODES STORED IN THE COMPUTER. THE ALARM SHOULD NOT FLAG WITHOUT STORING A CODE. SEARCHING THE INTERNET SHOWS THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH THE FIESTA FOR MANY YEARS. DEALERS HAVE MADE THE SAME REPAIRS SEVERAL TIMES ON THE SAME VEHICLE WITH THE ERRORS REOCCURRING. THE PRIMARY CONCERN IS THE ERROR FLAGGING WITHOUT A CODE PRESENT. FORD NEEDS TO FIX THIS POOR DESIGN. IN MY CASE THE CAUSE OF THE ERROR IS LIKELY A POOR CONNECTION UNDER THE HOOD. THAT ALONE IS A PROBLEM BUT IF THE SYSTEM LOGGED THE ERROR AT LEAST IT WOULD BE EASY TO FIND. MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD THEIR CARS REPAIRED THINKING THEY WERE OK ONLY TO HAVE IT HAPPEN AGAIN. ITS SCARY DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN THE CAR SUDDENLY LOSES POWER.",
