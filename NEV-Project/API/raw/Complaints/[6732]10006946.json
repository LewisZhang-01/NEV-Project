        "summary": "THE LEFT FRONT EXCITOR RING OF THE ABS SYSTEM FAILED.  DUE TO A CRACK IN THE RING, WHICH ALLOWED THE RING TO SLIDE INWARD ON THE AXLE DISENGAGING FROM THE SENSOR.  MY WIFE CAME TO THE END OF OUR DRIVEWAY AND ATTEMPTED TO STOP.  THE ANTILOCK SYSTEM PREVENTED THE BRAKES FROM ENGAGING PROPERLY.  THE ABS LIGHT CAME ON AND I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO METRO FORD IN RAYNHAM, MASS.  THEY SAID THE RING IS MADE RIGHT ON THE AXLE AND CAN NOT BE REPLACED BY ITSELF.  AND REPLACED THE AXLE WITH RING.  THAT INFO PROVED TO BE A LIE AS OTHER FORD DEALERS I LATER CALLED SAID THEY REPLACE JUST THE RING ALL THE TIME.  I HAVE 25 YEARS OF PROF. MECHANIC EXPERIENCE AND I INSPECTED AND REMOVED THE AXLE TO SEE IF IT SHOWED ANY WEAR.  *NLM   *NLM    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*755180",
