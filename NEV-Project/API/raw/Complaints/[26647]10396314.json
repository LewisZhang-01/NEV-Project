APPARENTLY, MINIS PRODUCED THREE MONTHS AFTER THIS VEHICLE ARE INCLUDED IN A RECALL OR \"EXTENDED WARRANTY\" BY THE MANUFACTURER FOR AIRBAG SENSOR LIGHTS, BUT NOT THIS SPECIFIC VEHICLE. BASED ON DISCUSSIONS WITH DEALER SERVICE, IT COULD BE A VERY COSTLY REPAIR, ESTIMATED AT $1200. IT SEEMS VERY STRANGE THAT VEHICLES MANUFACTURED SO CLOSE TO THE COVERED TIME PERIOD ARE ALSO HAVING ISSUES. PERHAPS MINI NEEDS TO CONSIDER EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF THE AIRBAG SENSOR EXTENDED WARRANTY.",
