MY 2004 BEETLE CONVERTIBLE 6-SPEED AUTOMATIC TURBO BEGAN SHIFTING GEARS ROUGHLY, JERKING AND SLIPPING ON UPSHIFTING AND DOWNSHIFTING A FEW MONTHS AGO AT 52K MILES. ONLY AFTER WARMING UP. SOUND FAMILIAR? YES, MY TRANSMISSION IS GOING OUT AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED FOR $6000, ACCORDING TO THE DEALER AND A PRIVATE AUTO TRANS SHOP. I'M THE ORIGINAL OWNER AND THE CAR HAS ALWAYS BEEN SERVICED ON TIME BY THE SAME DEALER. NEVER ABUSED. SINCE MANY PEOPLE ARE REPORTING THESE EXACT SAME SYMPTOMS, AND SINCE IT MIGHT LEAD TO AN ABRUPT GEAR FAILURE WHILE DRIVING, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE NHTSA INVESTIGATE. WEB SEARCHES REVEAL THE PROBLEM TO BE ACROSS MODEL YEARS. WEAR & TEAR? NO, I LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN IN NO.CAL. AND DRIVE MOSTLY FREEWAY MILES IN LIGHT TRAFFIC WITH FEW GEAR CHANGES. PLEASE INVESTIGATE. *TR",
