AT THE DODGE DEALER THEY TOLD ME MY FUEL LIFT PUMP WAS BAD (COST $255.00) THEY REPLACED IT THEN CALLED ME 3 DAYS LATER AND SAID MY FUEL INJECTION PUMP WAS BAD (COST $1700.00).  WHEN THE FUEL LIFT PUMP GOES OUT IT CAUSES THE FUEL INJECTION PUMP TO GO OUT BECAUSE IT RUNS DRY OF FUEL WHICH CAUSES IT TO GO BAD.  SO WHY DON'T  DODGE CUMMINS PUT A RELAY IN THERE THAT SHUTS DOWN THE FUEL SYSTEM WHEN THE FUEL LIFT PUMPS STOPS WORKING.  SO INSTEAD OF A $450 BILL NOW I HAVE $2400  BILL INSTEAD.  *JB",
