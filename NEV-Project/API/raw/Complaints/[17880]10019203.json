I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG.  A FEW MONTHS LATER I NOTICED THAT FLOOR PADDING ON THE BACK SEAT AREA (BOTH SIDES) STARTED BULGING.  THE DEALERSHIP INDICATED THAT IS NORMAL FOR ALL 2001 JETTAS.  I HAVE SEVERAL FRIENDS WHO DRIVES VW AND THEY NEVER HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR FLOOR PADDINGS.  A FEW MONTHS LATER, THE WINDOW ON THE DRIVER SIDE BROKE.  ALL IN ALL MY DRIVER SIDE AND PASSENGER SIDE WINDOWS HAVE MALFUNCTIONED 5 TIMES.   IN  ADDITION TO ALL THESE PROBLEMS, THE TEMP GAUGE ALSO MALFUNCTIONED.  THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE WOULD MOVE FROM EXTREMENME HEAT TEMP TOCOLD TEM AND VICE VERSA.  WHAT UPSET ME IS THAT THERE ARE TWO CURRENT RECALLS FOR 2001 JETTAS AND I HAVENT HEARD FROM VW.  I WASN'T EVEN INFORMED ABOUT THE WINDOW REGULATOR PROBLEM.",
