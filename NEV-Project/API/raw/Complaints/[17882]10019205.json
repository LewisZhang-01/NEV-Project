        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 2001 MALIBU LS USED BACK IN FEB 2002.  I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH THE BREAKS MAKING A GROUNDING NOISE WHEN I COME TO SLOW STOPS.  AS TIME GOES BY IT SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING MORE AND MORE OFTERN.  AT FIRST IT WAS ONLY WHEN I WOULD BE IN DRIVE THRU LINES WAITING OR THE BRAKE NOISE WOULD COME AND THEN GO AWAY FOR AWHILE.  THE NOISE IS LIKE A GROUNDING OR METAL RUBBING NOISE.  WHEN YOU PRESS ON THE BRAKES IT SOUND LIKE THE BRAKES ARE GOING TO SNAP OFF. I HAVE BROUGHT THIS CAR INTO TWO DIFFERENCE REPAIR SHOPS AND THEY ALL STATED THAT THIS PROBLEM IS DUE TO HOW CHEVY MADE THE BRAKES.  THEY TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT THEY NOW USE METAL ON THE BRAKES AND WHEN THE BRAKES GET HOT THEY MAKE THIS NOISE.  I CAN TURN THE CAR ON AND USUALLY WITHIN 15 MINUTES THE BRAKES START MAKING THE NOISE.  I HAD THE BRAKES OILED, BRAKES PADS REPAIRED AND NOTHING TAKES THE NOISE AWAY.  FROM WHAT I AM TOLD AND FROM WHAT I HAVE READ FROM OTHER PEOPLES COMPLAINTS IS THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM AND IF YOU GET THE BRAKES REPLACED EVENTUALLY IT WILL START AGAIN.  MANY PEOPLE HAVE WONDERED WHY NO RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED.  LIKE SOMEONE ELSE STATED WHAT DOES IT TAKE FOR A RECALL TO BE ISSUED.  A DEATH OR INJURY DUE TO THE BRAKES.  I AM LUCKY COMPARED TO WHAT OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THE BRAKES FAIL.  I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MORE I CAN TAKE OF HEARING THE NOISE.  I CONTACTED THE CHEVY CUSTOMER SERVICE VIA EMAIL AND ALL THEY TOLD ME WAS TO TAKE IT TO A DEALER AND HAVE IT LOOKED AT. SINCE THEY CAN'T INSPECT THE CAR THEY HAVE TO RELY ON THE DEALERS.  NOT ONCE DID THEY EVER ADMIT TO ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKES.  I PAID ALOT FOR THIS CAR AND I SHOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH BRAKE PROBLEMS.  I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER MANY TIMES BUT THEY WERE NOT HELPFULL.  I WON'T GO BACK ANYMORE TO THE DEALER BECAUSE I HAVE SPOKEN TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT CARS FROM THERE AND THEY HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS.  I JUST WANT THIS BRAKE ISSUE TO BE RESOLVED.",
