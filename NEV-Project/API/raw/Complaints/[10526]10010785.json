DEALER \"LOOSENED AND RE-TORQUED LEAF SPRING MOUNTING BOLTS\". NOISE WENT AWAY. ABOUT 7 MONTHS LATER,  THE NOISE RETURNED AND HAS WORSENED (NOW I AM OFF WARRANTY). TOOK IT TO A DIFFERENT DEALER, WHO SAID THAT THE ORIGINAL DEALER SHOULD HAVE REPLACED NOT JUST TIGHTENED LEAF SPRINGS DUE TO EXISTING SERVICE BULLETIN. ALSO, NEW DEALER CHARGED ME TO TEST DRIVE/DIAGNOSIS MY CAR. NOW THEY SAY \"SWAY BAR BUSHINGS\" NEED TO BE REPLACED. THEY HAVE ORDERED PARTS, BUT AT MY EXPENSE. I AM ONLY A FEW WEEKS OFF OF WARRANTY...THE NOISE IS MUCH WORSE, HAPPENS FRONT/BACK, STOP/GO, UP/DOWN-HILL, GOING OVER BUMPS. *JB",
