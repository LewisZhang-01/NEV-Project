BROUGHT IT IN TO THE CERTIFIED DEALERSHIP AND WAS EXPECTED TO PAY $1200 TO REPLACE THE POWER STEERING PUMP AND RACK. THISWAS ABSURD, THE CARS' WARRANT YWAS  36000 MILES, MY CAR IS AT 39,000 MILES. THIS WAS UNFAIR, AND AFTER RESEARCHING OTHER CONSUMERS WITH THE 2.7 LITRE ENGINE EXPIERENCED THE SAME PROBLEM, THIS SHOULD BE RECALLED. INSTANCES OF THIS PROBLEM HAVE EVEN RESULTED IN DEATH. I'M VERY UPSET.*AK",
