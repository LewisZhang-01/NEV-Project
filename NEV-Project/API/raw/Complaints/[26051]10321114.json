EVERY TIME MY 2005 DODGE DURANGO IS REFUELED, THE GASOLINE BACKWASHES OUT OF THE FILLER TUBE.  A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUEL GUSHES OUT OF THE FILLER TUBE REQUIRING THAT I DODGE THE FOUNTAIN OF FUEL.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  MY RESEARCH REVEALED THAT A RECALL HAD BEEN PLACED ON THIS MODEL FOR THE SAME SYMPTOMS, BUT DODGE CLAIMS THAT MY VIN ISN'T WASN'T INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  THEY SUGGESTED I TAKE IT TO A LOCAL DEALER FOR A DIAGNOSTIC, WHICH COST $70.  THE DIAGNOSIS IS THAT THE CHARCOAL EVAP CANISTER IS FILLED WITH \"LIQUID\" CAUSED BY OVERFILLING THE TANK AND DODGE REFUSES TO COVER THE REPAIR.  I CONTEND THAT THE EVAP ISSUE IS CAUSED BY THE VERY PROBLEM OF THE FUEL BACKWASH.  MY VISIT TO DODGEFORUM.COM REVEALED THAT THE FUEL OVERFLOW IS A COMMON PROBLEM.  GIVEN THE EXISTING RECALL, IT'S OBVIOUS THIS IS A SAFETY PROBLEM THAT DODGE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO CORRECT. *TR",
