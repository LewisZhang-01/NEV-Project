AS SHE APPLIED THE BRAKE, THE CAR VEERED WILDLY, SPINNING A FULL 360 DEGREES. TO GAIN CONTROL MY WIFE NEXT TRIED LIGHT ACCELERATION AND WAS ABLE WITH THAT AND BRUTE FORCE TO PULL THE CAR ONTO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. THE DEALER, AFTER EXAMINING THE VEHICLE, TOLD US THAT A NUT HAD COME OFF THE BOLT HOLDING THE RIGHT FRONT STRUT. WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW A NUT WOULD SUDDENLY  LOOSEN LIKE THIS AFTER 60,000 MILES AND 10 YEARS. THE REPAIR WAS TO REPLACE BOTH STRUTS AND OTHER DAMAGED COMPONENTS. WE ARE VERY MUCH RELIEVED THAT THIS FAILURE DID NOT HAVE CATASTROPHIC RESULTS, BUT ARE CONCERNED THAT SUCH A FAILURE COULD OCCUR.",
