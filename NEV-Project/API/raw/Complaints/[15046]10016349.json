        "summary": "I HAVE 5 ELECTRA IRONMAN TRAILER TIRES MADE BY HERCULES TIRES ON MY 35FT RV.  I HAVE SUFFERED 3 CATASTROPHIC BLOWOUTS - ONE ON EACH OF THE LONG TRIPS I HAVE TAKEN.  EACH FAILURE HAS OCCURRED IN THE SAME MANNER - THE SOUND OF A CANNON FOLLOWED BY INSTANT FLAT.  THE RESULT BEING A 8 INCH HOLE BLOWN CLEAN THROUGH THE STEEL BELTS AND TREAD OF THE TIRE.  I CALLED HERCULES TIRES TODAY, AND THEY REFERRED ME TO THEIR CANADIAN DIVISION, THE FORMER MAKE OF THEIR TIRES.  THEY REFUSED TO COVER ANY PORTION OF THE THREE FAILURES I'VE HAD TO DATE, AND THE TWO REMAINING TIRES, ONE OF WHICH LOOKS LIKE THE TREAD IS BEGINNING TO SEPARATE.  I ALSO,STILL HAVE THE CARCASS FROM THE THIRD BLOWOUT FOR INSPECTION.  THEY COMMENT WAS - THE WARRANTY PERIOD HAS EXPIRED, WITH NO CONCERN FOR SAFETY, THE POTENTIAL OF A DEFECT IN THE TIRES OR ANYTHING ELSE.  AS I AM SURE I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE STILL UTILIZING THESE TIRES, I CRINGE AT THE THOUGHT OF A LOADED RV, PULLED BY AN UNDERRATED VEHICLE, HAVING THESE TYPES OF UNCONTROLLED BLOWOUTS.  I HAVE HAD THREE SUCH OCCURRENCES - MAY OF 2001, MARCH OF 2002, AND DECEMBER OF 2002.   *NLM",
