ANY SIGNS MY WIFE FELT WERE ATTRIBUTED TO TRACTION CONTROL ENGAGEMENT DUE TO INCLEMENT WEATHER.  THE VEHICLE FAILED WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, OBVIOUSLY A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION.  ACURA HAS REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION, BUT THE REPLACEMENT IS BEGINNING TO FAIL ALSO.  THE FIRST SIGNS WERE TRANSMISSION SLIPPAGE WHEN ATTEMPTING TO CROSS A BUSY HIGHWAY, AGAIN A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION.  ONLY REPORTING THIS DUE TO OBVIOUS NATURE OF ISSUE AND THE FACT NO RECALLS HAVE YET BEEN ISSUED...FIXING THIS PROBLEM ON AN OCCURENCE BASIS IS NOT SUFFICIENT.  EVEN BARRING DIRECT ACCIDENTS DUE TO LOSS OF CONTROL, IT IS STILL A POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE TO HAVE YOUR VEHICLE LOSE VELOCITY ON A BUSY HIGHWAY OR INTERSECTION.*JB",
