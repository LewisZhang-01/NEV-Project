CAR WOULD BE FINE FOR A MONTH AND THEN CHATTER WOULD RETURN. PARTICULARLY OCCURS WHEN COLD AND TRYING TO ENGAGE IN FIRST GEAR. TOLD AT 44,000 MILES THAT  THE CLUTCH WAS WORN AND NEEDED REPLACING. WHEN I COMPLAINED ABOUT THE CHATTER THEY NEVER RESOLVED, THEY KEPT SAYING THAT WAS NORMAL AND THE EARLY WEAR MUST BE DUE TO MY DRIVING. REPLACED THE CLUTCH AND ONCE AGAIN, A FEW MONTHS LATER CHATTER RETURNED. ANOTHER DEALER TOLD ME THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE REPLACED THE FLYWHEEL AS WELL SINCE 99% OF CLUTCH CHATTER IS CAUSED BY THE FLYWHEEL SURFACE. TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE ORIGINAL DEALER WHO AGAIN SAID THE CHATTER WAS NORMAL AND WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THE CAR STILL JERKS WHEN I SHIFT INTO FIRST WHEN IT IS COLD, MAKING IT VERY UNSAFE FOR ME AND MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER TO DRIVE.  *JB      ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*****764329",
