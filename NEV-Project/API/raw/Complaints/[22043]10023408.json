I WAS ABLE TO TURN OFF THE KEY AND PULL OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY. I NOTICED THAT THE FLOOR MAT KEEPS TWISTING WHERE THIS WILL BE A RECURRING PROBLEM. THESE ARE THE FACTORY FLOOR MATS. I CHECKED TO SEE IF THERE WAS A RECALL, WHICH THERE WAS, BUT THE MANUFACTURER STATES THAT MY CAR WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE RECALL. I EXPLAINED THAT WHAT HAPPENED TO ME IS THE REASON FOR THE RECALL, BUT THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD NOT REPLACE THE MATS WITHOUT CHARGING ME. I COMPLAINED DIRECTLY TO NISSAN THROUGH THEIR WEB SITE, AND OTHER THAN A CONFIRMATION NOTICE THEY HAVE FAILED TO RESPOND TO MY COMPLAINT. I'M SURE THAT THIS CONDITION WILL CAUSE ACCIDENTS, BUT NISSAN DOES NOT SEEM TO CARE. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, I COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT GETTING NEW FLOORMATS, MINE ARE IN PERFECT CONDITION, BUT ARE DANGEROUS.    *NLM",
