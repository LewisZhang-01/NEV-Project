ALTHOUGH THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONDITION, THEY SAY IT IS THE FAULT OF THE GASOLINE. I HAVE TRIED MANY DIFFERENT BRANDS AND MY NEIGHBORS CARS DO NOT EXHIBIT THIS SMELL. SULFUR DIOXIDE IS ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS TO PEOPLE WITH RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS SUCH AS MY DAUGHTER WHO HAS ASTHMA. HER CONDITION HAS BECOME WORSE THIS WINTER BECAUSE (WE THINK) OF HER CONTACT WITH THIS CAR. TOYOTA HAS SAID THAT THE CONDITION IS NOT COVERED IN THEIR WARRANTY AND THEY REFUSE TO FIX IT.    *NLM",
