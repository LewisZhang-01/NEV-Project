        "summary": "WE PURCHASED 2  NEW SUZUKI'S XL7 2002 WITH BRIDGESTONE DUELER HT687 P235/60/R16. STARTED VIBRATING ALMOST FROM THE START. TERRIBLE PULSING WHEN USING THE BRAKE. HAD TIRES FORCED ROAD BALANCED 3 TIMES. NO CHANGE. 4 WERE REPLACED ON ONE CAR AND ONE ON THE OTHER. PROBLEM STILL EXISTED. WE WERE TOLD BY FIRESTONE DEALER THAT IT WAS NOT THE TIRES. HE SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE CAR, SUCH AS BRAKES OR SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE FRONT END. WE HAD AN INDEPENDENT DEALER CHECK ALL THE ABOVE AND COULD ONLY FIND A PROBLEM WITH THE TIRES. AFTER FEELING LOST, I WROTE FIRESTONE WITH THE COMPLAINT AND FINALLY WAS CONTACTED BY THEM. FIRESTONE/BRIDGESTONE FINALLY AGREED TO REPLACE ALL 10 TIRES A YEAR LATER WITH WHAT EVER TIRE WE CHOOSE. THEY AGREED TO PAY $80.00 PLUS MOUNTING AND BALANCING TOWARD THE 10 TIRES WE WANTED AFTER SOME ARGUING. THE DUELER 687 EMITTED A LOUD BUMPING WHEN DRIVING AND VIBRATION WHEN BRAKES WERE APPLIED. WHEN TIRES THE WERE REMOVED, WE NOTICED CUPPING ON SOME. ALSO NOTICED TIRES WERE NOT ALIKE, SOME WERE STEEL PLUS POLYESTER OTHERS WERE STEEL PLUS POLYESTER PLUS NYLON. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE TIRES AT ALL. WE WERE TOLD BY THE CAR DEALER, THAT THESE TIRES WERE DESIGNED FOR THIS SUV.*JB",
