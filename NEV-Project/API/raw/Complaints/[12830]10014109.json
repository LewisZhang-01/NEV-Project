        "summary": "I HAVE A 2002 GRAND CARAVAN WITH DUAL SLIDING DOORS.  SOMETIMES, THE DOORS DO NOT DETECT AN OBSTRUCTION AND ATTEMPT TO CLOSE ANYWAY.  YESTERDAY, MY 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER RECEIVED MINOR BRUISING TO HER WAIST AFTER CLIMBING OUT OF THE VAN WHILE THE DOOR WAS IN MOTION.  THE DOOR DID NOT RETRACT UNTIL I FORCIBLY PUSHED THE DOOR AFTER SEEING HER IN DISTRESS.  IT DID NOT RETRACT AFTER SENSING HER TORSO IN THE PATH.  SHE WAS OK BUT RECEIVED A BRUISE ON EACH SIDE OF HER WAIST (DOOR AND VAN BODY CONTACT).  I HAD TO USE UNNECESSARY FORCE TO FORCE THE DOOR OPEN AND DOING SO DISENGAGED THE AUTOMATIC CLOSING MECHANISM WHICH REQUIRED A MANUAL CLOSING AFTERWARDS.  THIS HAS HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES BUT HAS NEVER RESULTED IN AN INJURY UNTIL NOW.  THE DEALER SAYS THAT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RESISTANCE IS REQUIRED FOR THE AUTOREVERSAL TO ACTIVATE.  EVIDENTLY IT REQUIRES MORE FORCE THAN MY CHILD'S BODY.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.  *NLM",
