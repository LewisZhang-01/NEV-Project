        "summary": "THE BLOWER ON THE AIR CONDITIONER WAS NOT WORKING.  IN ADDITION I WENT IN TWICE TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT THE HEATING UNIT OR CLIMATE CONTROL.  THE THIRD TIME THEY REPLACED IT, BUT IT STILL TURNS OFF AND SETS TO ZERO.  NOW THE HEAT WILL COME ON WHEREAS IT DIDN'T BEFORE.    I RECENTLY (LAST WEEK FEB. 16) DOWN SHIFTED IN TRAFFIC BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT AHEAD.  I DOWN SHIFTED FOR FIVE TO FOUR TO THREE AND THE CAR TURNED OFF AND I DRIFTED TO THE SIDE.  I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALER AND THEY LOOKED AT IT LATER THE FOLLOWING WEEK.  I HAD TO CALL THE SALES DEPARTMENT TO GET SOMEONE FROM SERVICE TO CALL ME (MY SALESMAN HAS SINCE QUIT).  WHEN THE CALL WAS RETURNED, THE MANAGER OF SALES TODD ALUDED TO THE FACT THAT THIS REPAIR WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  HE SAID THAT THE PROBLEM WAS DIAGNOSED AS NON-MECHANICAL (IMPLYING IT WAS DRIVER ERROR OR NEGLANCE) AND SAAB USA WOULD NOT HOLD TO THE WARRANTY.  THE CAR WAS PURCHASED ON APRIL 12, 2002 AND HAS LESS THAT 25K MILES; I HAVE DRIVEN FOR OVER 23 YEARS AND HAD SEVERAL MANUAL CARS AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO DOWNSHIFT TO SLOW THE CAR IN ANY SITUATION.  I BELIEVE I HAVE A LEMON.  THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES WITH THE CAR SUCH AS THE TCS AND BRAKING SYSTEM IN RAIN AND SNOW, YET THE DEALERSHIP TELLS ME THE NOISE AND LOCKING THAT IS FELT UNDER MY FEET IS NORMAL.",
