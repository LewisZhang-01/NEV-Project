IN THE SAME WEEK, THE REAR DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR DID THE SAME THING. I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER/SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT \"THESE PLASTICS JUST DON'T HOLD UP WELL IN THIS SUN.\" I WAS ALSO TOLD IT WOULD COST $150 TO REPAIR THEM [AS OF JANUARY 2003 IT WOULD NOW COST $200 TO REPAIR THEM] AND THAT SINCE THE CAR WAS IN ITS FOURTH YEAR, THE WARRANTY WAS NO LONGER IN EFFECT. I AND MY WIFE HAVE BOTH BEEN CUT SEVERAL TIMES TRYING TO GET INTO THE VEHICLE. TOYOTA'S RESPONSE IS STILL \"THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY FOR 36 MONTHS.\"",
