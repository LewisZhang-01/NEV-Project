I LIVED THE LAST TWO YEARS IN ALASKA AND WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT IN SEATTLE THE SALT FROM THE ROADS CREATED EARLY CORROSION ON THE BRAKE PADS AND DISC.  THE OUTBACK IS DESIGNED FOR MORE RUGGED DRIVING AND FOR GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS WITH HARSHER WINTERS.  SOMETHING ABOUT THE DESIGN OF THE BRAKES CAUSES THE SALT AND DIRT FROM WINTER ROADS TO CHANNEL UP THROUGH THE BRAKE SYSTEM AND CAUSE EXCESSIVE WEAR AND TEAR.  I JUST PAID FOR A COMPLETE BRAKE REPLACEMENT AS THE FRONT PADS WERE NO LONGER ENGAGING CORRECTLY AND THE BRAKES ARE VERY WORN DUE TO THE SALT.*JB",
