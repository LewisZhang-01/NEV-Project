THIS MODULE HAS RESULTED IN PROBLEMS BEING REPORTED IN MY CAR THAT THE BRAKES, SELF RESTRAINT SYSTEM, TELEPHONE SYSTEM, AND TIRE PRESSURE HAVE FAILED.  I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING IF THE THE SAFTY SYSTEMS ARE OPERATIONAL OR NOT.  AT THIS POINT I AM DRIVING A CAR THAT SAYS MY SRS SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING.  I HAVE BEEN IN THE MERCEDES SHOP NO LESS THAN 4 TIMES TO HAVE THE PROBLEM REPAIRED.  IT SIMPLY RE-OCCURS AFTER EACH REPAIR.    FROM RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET, THIS APPEARS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM.",
