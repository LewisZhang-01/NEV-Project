I WAS UNABLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE FOR APPROX. 5 SECONDS.  SINCE I HAD BEGUN THE TURN BUT WAS UNABLE TO FINISH THE TURN, THE VEHICLE WENT INTO THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC LANE.  IF THERE HAD BEEN A CAR IN THE ONCOMING LANE, I WOULD HAVE HIT IT.  AFTER APPROX. 5 SECONDS, THE STEERING WHEEL UNLOCKED AND I WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE THE TURN AND GET THE VEHICLE BACK INTO THE PROPER LANE.  TOOK VEHICLE INTO DEALER; DEALER INFORMED ME OF A MANUFACTURER SAFETY BULLETIN FOR LOSS OF POWER STEERING. DEALER RE-PROGRAMMED POWER STEERING, TEST DROVE AND INFORMED ME THAT IT HAD BEEN REPAIRED.  WHEN I PICKED UP VEHICLE FROM DEALER, I WAS BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPACE, LOST COMPLETE POWER STEERING; UNABLE TO GET VEHICLE BACK INTO PARKING SPOT.  CURRENTLY VEHICLE IS AT DEALER.  THIS VEHICLE HAS APPROX. 8K MILES.  THIS IS THE 2ND MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN.  THE FIRST OCCURRED APPROX. 1 MONTH AGO.  VEHICLE WAS MAKING LOUD KNOCKING NOISE.  DEALER INFORMED ME THE FLY WHEEL WAS DAMAGED.  GM TOLD DEALER TO REPLACE THE TORQUE CONVERTER.  I FEEL UNSAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE.",
