AS IT LOST POWER, FIRST MY OIL LIGHT STARTED BLINKING AND THEN MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND STARTED BLINKING ALSO.    I WAS ABLE TO TURN IT AROUND AND DRIVE APPROX. 100 FT INTO THE DELTA TOWN HALL PARKING LOT WHERE I DISCOVERED MY ENGINE WAS SMOKING AND I HAD LOST NUMEROUS FLUIDS OUT OF THE ENGINE.  I THEN CALLED A LOCAL WRECKER AND THEY TOWED IT TO THEIR SHOP.  A&L AUTO IN IRON RIVER, WI.  THEY STATED AFTER LOOKING AT IT THAT SOMETHING MADE A LARGE HOLE IN THE SIDE OF THE ENGINE AND MOST LIKELY THE ENGINE WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED.  I THEN REQUESTED THEY TOW IT TO THE KIA DEALERSHIP IN DULUTH, MN WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.",
