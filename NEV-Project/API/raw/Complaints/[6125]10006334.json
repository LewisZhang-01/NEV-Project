HARLEY DAVIDSON HAS SINCE REPLACED THE DEFECTIVE BEARINGS WITH A STRONGER ONE, HOWEVER, THE REFUSE TO RECALL MOTORS WITH THE BAD BEARINGS IN THEM UNLESS THE CUSTOMER PAYS FOR THE FIX. IF THE BEARINGS FAIL WHILE THE MOTORCYCLE IS RUNNING, THE REAR WHEEL COULD LOCK UP AND CAUSE SEVERE INJURY AND OR DEATH TO THE RIDER, PASSENGER, AND OTHER MOTORISTS. MY BIKE HAS THAT WEAK BEARINGS IN IT, AND I WISH FOR A FACTORY RECALL TO REPLACE THEM. AK*   *JB **** DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****723494.",
