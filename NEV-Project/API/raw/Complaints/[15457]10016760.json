I CALLED A FEW HYUNDAI DEALERSHIPS TO SET UP AN APPOINTMENT TO GET MY CAR FIXED.  MOST OF THEM WERE NICE UNTIL I MENTIONED THE FACT THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS A RECALL ITEM.  THEN OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T GET ME AN APPOINTMENT FOR A FEW WEEKS OR I HAD TO SUPPLY THEM WITH ALL MY INFORMATION OVER THE PHONE.  I DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE GIVING A STRANGER SUCH INFORMATION SO I CHOSE NOT TO.  ONCE THE CAR WAS AT THE CLOSEST LOCATION FROM MY HOUSE, THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS NOT A RECALL ITEM BASED ON THE VIN NUMBER.  PERSONALLY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ELSE A FRONT LOWER CONTROL ARM CAN JUST RUST OUT AND BREAK.  SO NOW WHAT DO I DO.  DO I JUST SIT BACK AND PAY ALOT OF MONEY TO GET IT FIXED OR DO I PERSUE FINDING A WAY TO GET MY VIN NUMBER ON THE LIST OF RECALLS?",
