WELL, IT'S ALREADY AT 36,000 AND IT IS ALREADY GRINDING AND SQEAKING ALL THE TIME, EVEN WHEN IT'S NOT RAINING.  I TOOK IT IN TO A PROFESSIONAL BRAKE SPECIALIST AND THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ALMOST $ 500 TO REPLACE THE ROTARS, BRAKE PADS AND SHOES.  THEY SAID IT VERY UNUSUAL FOR A CAR WITH LOW MILES TO HAVE THE ROTARS REPLACED.   I WAS NOT ABOUT TO DISH OUT THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY TO REPLACE THEM WHEN THEY SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER MY EXTENDED WARRANTY.",
