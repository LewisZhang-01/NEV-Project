I CALLED 2 DEALERS AND THE CHEVROLET CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE LINE AND ALL OF THEM DENIED THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON MY CAR.  I LOOKED ONLINE AND FOUND A GM DOCUMENT THAT STATED THE VEHICLES THAT WERE COVERED IN THE RECALL AND MINE FIT RIGHT INTO THE RANGE OF VIN NUMBERS LISTED.  AFTER CALLING THEM AGAIN, THEY SAID THEY HAD FOUND THE LIST THAT I HAD, BUT SINCE MY CAR WAS NOT LISTED IN THE VISC THAT THEY WOULD NOT REPAIR MY VEHICLE.    *NLM",
