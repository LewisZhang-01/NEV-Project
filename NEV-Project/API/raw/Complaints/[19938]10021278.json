        "summary": "I OWN A 1995 MITSIBUSHI MONTERO SR. ABOUT A WEEK AGO I NOTICED AN OIL LEAK FROM THE BACK OF THE CAR. I TOOK MY CAR TO THE MECHANIC AND HE CHECK IT OUT AND TOLD ME THAT THE REAR TRANSAXLE WAS CRACKED ON THE LEFT SIDE (DRIVER SIDE) WHERE IT WAS WELDED TOGETHER FROM THE MANUFACTURER AND DIFFERENTIAL OIL WAS LEAKING THROUGH THERE. I DROVE THE CAR BACK HOME ABOUT A MILE TO FIND OUT THAT IT COMPLETELY BROKE LOOSE AROUND THE WELD AND THE WHEEL WAS SLANTED ON A SIDE ALMOST TO COME OUT. IT'S HOLDING ON NOW BY ONLY THE OTHER PARTS OF THE REAR SUSPENSION.  IT'S  A GOOD THING I WAS NOT ON A HIGHWAY, SO ANYWAY I WENT TO MY LOCAL MITSUBISHI DEALER AND EXPLAINED THE SITUATION AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THE CAR IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY AND THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT IT. I TOLD THEM THIS IS NOT SOMETHING NORMAL AND I THINK IT'S A MANUFACTURER DEFECT BECAUSE A WELD IS NOT SUPPOSE TO BRAKE NO MATTER WHAT BECAUSE MY CAR WAS NEVER HIT UNDERNEATH THERE ISN'T ANY DAMAGE AROUND IT.  MY MECHANIC SAID THE SAME THING THAT ALL HIS LIFE HE NEVER SAW SOMETHING LIKE THIS. SO I CALLED MITSUBISHI CUSTOMER SERVICE AND I EXPLAINED THEM THE PROBLEM AND TOLD ME THE SAME AS THE DEALER. IT'S NOT UNDER WARRANTY AND THEY DON'T CARE  NOW I'M WITHOUT A CAR WHICH I DEPEND ON A LOT AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO AND I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO FIX THE PROBLEM AS MY MECHANIC TOLD ME IT WOULD COST A LOT.  SO I'M ASKING YOU PLEASE LOOK IN THE SITUATION BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A SAFETY RELATED PROBLEM AND THE PEOPLE AT MITSUBISHI TRY TO AVOID IT  I CAN TAKE DIGITAL PICTURES IF NEEDED TO BE SEEN OR CAN ARRANGE FOR SOMEBODY TO TAKE A LOOK AT MY CAR BECAUSE I CAN'T USE IT THE WAY IT IS  MY CAR HAS ONLY 90,000 ON IT AND IT WAS TAKEN CARE OF ALL THE TIME AND I DON'T THINK THAT THIS SHOULD HAVE HAPPEN  THANK YOU.  *AK",
