THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTS BETWEEN 2-3 AND 3-4 ARE ROUGH AND IT JERKS INTO GEAR.  THE FIRST TIME INTO THE DEALER, THEY \"VERIFIED\" MY CONCERN AND DID ABOUT $1,000 IN REPAIRS.  IT WAS OK FOR ABOUT 3 WEEKS AND STARTED AGAIN.  IT HAS GRADUALLY GOTTEN WORSE, AND THE DEALER CLAIMS THEY CAN NOT FIND A PROBLEM.  THEY HAVE UPDATED AND REPROGRAMMED THE SYSTEM MANY TIMES, AND NOTHING HELPS.  I AM NOW ON MY THIRD TRIP TO THE DEALER FOR THIS.  WITH ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS AND FORD'S SERVICE BULLETINS THAT LIST THE EXACT PROBLEMS I AM HAVING, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY FORD IS NOT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THIS!!  *JB",
