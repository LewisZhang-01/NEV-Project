I WAS ALSO ADVISED THAT THIS WAS NOT COVERED BY THE \"BUMPER-TO-BUMPER\" 36,000 MILE WARRANTY.  RATHER, THE WARRANTY PERIOD FOR BRAKE ROTORS IS 12,000 MILES.     I PAID FOR THE REPLACEMENT BUT NOTE THAT I HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM ON A 1999 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE AT WELL OVER 12,000 MILES AND THE ROTORS WERE REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY.    IT APPEARS THAT CHRYSLER KNOWS THAT IT HAS A PROBLEM WITH PREMATURE WEAR ON DISC BRAKE ROTORS, BUT HAS CHOSEN TO ADDRESS IT BY LIMITING THE WARRANTY RATHER THAN FIXING THE PROBLEM.",
