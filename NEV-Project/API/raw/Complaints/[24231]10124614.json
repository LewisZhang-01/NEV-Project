        "summary": "THE CONDITION I WILL DESCRIBE HAS EXISTED WITH THIS VEHICLE SINCE WE BOUGHT IT. I HAVE THE WORK ORDERS FROM THE TWO DEALERS I HAVE WORKED WITH TO RESOLVE THE PROBEM. EACH TIME IT HAS COST ABOUT $250.00 TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEND THESE $$$ AGAIN.  WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN I PRESS THE ACCELERATOR THE CAR DOES NOT RESPOND. IT COUGHS, HESITATES AND VERY SLOWLY ACCELERATES. IN TRAFFIC, THIS HAS ALMOST CAUSED SEVERAL ACCIDENTS. IT TAKES ABOUT SEVEN TO TEN SECONDS TO FINALLY REACH TRAFFIC SPEED. FORTUNATELY, WE HAVE ESCAPED ANY COLLISION-- SO FAR, BUT WE HAVE COME VERY CLOSE SEVERAL TIMES. THE CAR WAS GOOD FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND SUDDENLY, THIS PAST WEEK IT STARTED HESITAING AGAIN. THE CAR HAS ABOUT 55,000 MILES, BUT, AS I SAID, THIS CONDITION HAS BEEN WITH THE CAR SINCE IT WAS NEW. I KNOW WHAT THE DEALERS WILL SAY-\"WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT\", WHICH WILL COST A MINIMUM OF $100.00. THEY WILL KEEP THE CAR A FEW DAYS SAYING THEY CAN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. WELL, THE PROBLEM IS THERE, WHETHER THEY FIND IT OR NOT. THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING AND VERY UNSAFE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE HASN'T BEEN A RECALL OR PROBLEM CALLED TO YOUR ATTENTION ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. CONTACT CHRYSLER, PLEASE, AND SEE WHAT THEY SAY. I REFUSE TO GO TO A DEALER-- THIS TIME--WITHOUT SOME DIRECTION FROM YOU.",
