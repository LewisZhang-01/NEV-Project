NO SERIOUS DAMAGE TO TRUCK. I HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO THE LOCAL FORD DEALER FOR REPAIR. I WAS AWARE OF A RECALL FOR THE 2000-2001 F-150'S WITH THIS PROBLEM. THE DEALER WAS VERY PROFESSIONAL, HOWEVER FORD ALSO HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE 1997 MODELS AND SHOULD BE RECALLED . IF THIS FIRE HAD NOT BEEN NOTICED BY ONE OF MY CO-WORKERS I MIGHT HAVE LOSTED THE TRUCK. THIS COSTED ME AROUND $170 WITH TOWING AND I FEEL FORD IS AWARE THEY HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE AND SHOULD  DO THE RIGHT THING FOR SAFETY AND AT FORDS EXPENSE.",
