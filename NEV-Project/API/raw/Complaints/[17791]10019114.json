THERE WERE ALSO NUMEROUS OTHER AREAS OF NOTABLE SEPARATION THAT APPEARED TO BE A RESULT OF THE RUBBER MATERIAL BEING TOO DRY PERHAPS. I CALLED FORD AND THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO ABOUT IT AND REFERRED ME TO THIS SITE.  BEFORE FAILURE OCCURRED WITH MY FAMILY IN THE VEHICLE, I INSTALLED ALL FOUR NEW TIRES, MODEL MICHELIN LTX M/S THAT I PURCHASED FROM COSCO. THIS IS A 2001 FORD EXCURSION WITH APPROX 30,000 MILES ON IT AT THE TIME. UNFORTUNATES, I WASN'T REALLY THINKING AT THE TIME AND DID NOT HAVE THE TECHNICIANS AT COSCO SAVE THE OLD TIRES FOR ME.  *NLM",
