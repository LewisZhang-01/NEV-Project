        "summary": "MY 1993 GEO STORM HAS BEEN STALLING LATELY. IT IS TOTALLY SPORADIC AND DOES IT WHEN I AM PULLING OUT, WHEN IT IS IDLING, AND WHEN I AM ON A FREEWAY GOING ALONG AT A CONSTANT SPEED. THIS HAS PUT ME IN A VERY SERIOUS SITUATION A NUMBER OF TIMES AND HAS SEVERELY SHAKEN ME.  IT WILL STALL IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION, AND LUCKILY ALL 6 TIMES THIS HAPPENED NO ONE WAS COMING EITHER WAY. I NO LONGER DRIVE MY CAR, AND I AM AFRAID TO SELL IT DUE TO THE FACT THIS WILL HAPPEN TO SOMEONE ELSE. I HAD CHECKED EVERYTHING I COULD THINK OF UNTIL I READ A ARTICLE ABOUT THE ELECTRONIC CONTROL MODULE BEING BAD IN 89-93 GEO STORMS, ISUZU IMPULSES, AND ASUNA SUNFIRES. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A MAJOR RECALL PUT FORTH TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. THANK YOU.*JB",
