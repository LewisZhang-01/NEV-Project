THE ENGINE TURNS OFF BUT THE DOOR LOCKS DON'T FUNCTION AND THE RADIO AND OTHER STUFF STAYS ON.  IT CAN RUN YOUR BATTERY DOWN WHICH IS UNSAFE,  IT HAPPENS WHEN THE CAR IS IN PARK AND YOU PUSH THE POWER BUTTON TO SHUT IT DOWN.  THEY SAID I HAD TO AGREE TO $150 FOR DIAGNOSE.  THEY SAID THE SHIFTER HAS TO BE REPLACED FOR $600.  THEY LET THE AIR OUT OF MY TIRES.  I HAD THEM AT 34. THEY WROTE 34 BUT THE LIGHT CAME ON TO INDICATE LOW TIRE PRESSURE. THREE TIRES HAD 30 PSI AND ONE HAD 34 PSI.",
