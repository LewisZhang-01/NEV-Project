        "summary": "96 FORD EXPLORER: CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON TWO WEEKS AGO, ONE WEEK LATER, BATTERY STALLED AND REQUIRED A JUMP, THE POWER LEVELS READ NORMAL.  I CHECKED THE POWER DISTRIBUTION BOX AND THE FUSES DID NOT MATCH OWNER'S MANUAL.   TWO PARTS SHOPS ADVISED THIS COULD TRIGGER FIRE, OR A DEVICE TO MALFUNCTION. PER FORD OWNER'S MANUAL, AIRBAG & ATBS IMPACTED. I REPLACED THE FUSES TO MATCH THE OWNER'S MANUAL. TODAY, I TOOK THE CAR TO A PRIVATE SHOP, THAT WORKED ON THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM EARLIER. THE OWNER PULLED AN ALL DATA SCHEMA, WHICH IS QUITE DIFFERENT. HOW DO I KNOW WHICH ELECTRICAL SCHEMA IS CORRECT - THE  OWNER'S MANUAL,  THE OTHER SHOPS REFERRED TO, OR ALL DATA? IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE, 60A VS 30A FUSES, DIFFERENT BLANK RELAYS, ETC.  IF THE FORD MANUAL IS CORRECT, AND I FOLLOW THE ALL DATA SCHEMA, IT COULD TRIGGER FIRE OR MALFUNCTION. VICE VERSA, WOULD BE BAD ALSO. EITHER WAY, CONSUMERS SHOULD BE ALERTED? EITHER TO  INCORRECT ELECTRICS IN THE FORD MANUAL, OR TO AN INCORRECT ALL DATA SCHEMA USED BY MECHANICS?  (I HAVE ASKED FORD, ALSO, FOR A REPLY.)   ALSO - THIS IS THE SECOND TIME IN 6 MONTHS I HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, BUT NO OTHER SYMPTOMS. THE FIRST TIME, THE MECHANIC REPLACED THE CAM SENSOR, AND IT EVENTUALLY WENT OFF. HE STATED THIS WARNING LIGHT WAS INSIGNIFICANT, AND REFERRED ONLY TO EMISSIONS STANDARDS. (NO VISIBLE EMISSIONS). I NOTE THAT - PER THE OWNERS MANUAL AGAIN - THIS WARNING LIGHT CAN ALSO BE TRIGGERED BY A MONITORING, GPS, OR ALARM DEVICE BEING INSTALLED IN THE VEHICLE. IF I CAN FIND NO OTHER CAUSE, HOW WOULD I CHECK FOR THIS, AND DO YOU HAVE OTHER RECORDS OF THIS BEING THE CAUSE?   THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ALSO AN ISSUE, LAST SPRING. IN APRIL 02, THE FORD DEALER IN ORLANDO REPLACED THE IDLE AIR CONTROL, AND THE VALVE ASSEMBLY-THRO. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ALSO AN ISSUE SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASE; DEALER REPLACED SENSOR ASSEMBLY-EGR, THERMOSTAT ASSEMBLY. IS THERE AN ASSOCIATED  RECALL, OR DOES THIS FIT OTHER PATTERN? THANKS!     *JB",
