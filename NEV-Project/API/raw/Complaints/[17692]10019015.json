        "summary": "ERRATIC ENGINE PERFORMANCE ALMOST CAUSING NUMEROUS ACCIDENTS.    WHILE ATTEMPTING TO HOLD A CONSTANT SPEED AND THROTTLE POSITION, THE BIKE WILL LOSE POWER (AS IF THE GAS WAS SHUTOFF). OPENING THE THROTTLE WILL PRODUCE MORE POWER, CAUSING THE BIKE TO SURGE FORWARD.  AFTER DECELERATION IN GEAR USING COMPRESSION BRAKING THERE IS NO THROTTLE RESPONSE, WITH THE INITIAL TURNING OF THE THROTTLE, FOR ACCELERATION. TURNING THE THROTTLE OPEN FURTHER RESULTS IN A BURST OF POWER NOT PROPORTIONAL TO THE TWIST OF THE THROTTLE.  WHEN ACCELERATING SLOWLY FROM A STOP, THE THROTTLE RESPONSE IS WEAK UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 3500 RPMS. AT APPROXIMATELY 3500 RPMS THE BIKE POWER WILL INCREASE AS IF THE THROTTLE WAS OPENED A LOT MORE.  WHILE RIDING AT A LOW SPEED (APPROXIMATELY 15-20 MPH) THE BIKE WILL BUCK (NOT LUG) IN 2ND GEAR. GOING DOWN TO 1ST GEAR CAUSES THE BIKE TO ACCELERATE THE DECELERATE. THE ONLY WAY TO GET AROUND THIS IS TO LUG THE BIKE IN 3RD GEAR.  *NLM",
