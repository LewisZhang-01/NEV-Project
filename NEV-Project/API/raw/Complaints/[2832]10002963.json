        "summary": "I HAVE A 2000 HONDA CIVIC EX.  FROM THE FIRST DAY OF OWNERSHIP, THE CAR'S ANTISKID BRAKES SOMETIMES KICK IN WHEN NOT NEEDED.  FOR EXAMPLE, RIDING OVER BUMPS SUCH AS A RAILROAD SOMETIMES SETS THE ANTISKID OFF AND IT CONTINUES FOR SOME TIME AFTER THE RAILROAD HAS PASSED, THUS UNNECESSARILY INCREASING STOPPING DISTANCE.  SOMETIMES JUST ON PLAIN ROAD IT DOES THE SAME.  IT SEEMS TO OCCUR MORE IN COLD WEATHER.  WE HAVE A 2000 ACCORD AND IT DOESN'T ACT THIS WAY.  I HAVE DRIVEN MANY OTHER HONDA'S AND NONE EVER ACTED THIS WAY.  I AM AFRAID THIS MAJOR SAFETY DEFECT MAY SOMEDAY LEAD TO A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  I HAVE COMPLAINED LONG AND HARD TO HONDA CORPORATION, BUT THEY INSIST THE DESCRIBED PROBLEM IS IMPOSSIBLE TO OCCUR.  THEY MAINTAIN THAT THE BRAKES ARE A 'BLACK BOX', AND EITHER WORK PERFECT OR NOT, ALL THE TIME.  THEY HAVE LOOKED AT THE CAR, AND SAID SINCE THEY CLAIM THEY CANNOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND SINCE IT CAN'T POSSIBLY OCCUR ANYWAY IN THEIR OPINION, I AM OUT OF LUCK.  SURELY MY HONDA IS NOT THE ONLY CAR THIS EVER OCCURRED IN.  IT IS ALMOST LIKE SOMETHING IS LOOSE, LIKE A SENSOR OR A RIGHT FRONT SUSPENSION COMPONENT(S). PLEASE HELP BEFORE HONDA CORPORATION KILLS SOMEONE.  I HAVE TOLD HONDA THAT I PERSONALLY HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY ACCIDENT.  THANKS.  J RICKY SIMMONS",
