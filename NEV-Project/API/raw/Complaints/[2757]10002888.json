THE DEALERSHIP IS UNWILLING TO ASSIST ME WITH THE REPAIRS, WHICH COST $2,700.00.  I HEARD A HUMMING NOISE AND FIVE MINUTES LATER, MY VAN STARTING SLIPPING GEARS AND LEFT ME AND MY FAMILY STRANDED.  THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A MAJOR DEFECT IN THE TRANSMISSIONS OF DODGE - IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT A TRANSMISSION WOULD FAIL WITH SUCH LOW MILEAGE ON IT.  I HAVE BEEN READING THE OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THIS WEBSITE AND THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A MAJOR FLAW WITH THE DODGE PRODUCTS AND THEIR TRANMISSION.  THEY NEED TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PROBLEM AND OFFER ASSISTANCE TO US CONSUMERS - AFTER ALL, IF IT WEREN'T FOR US BUYING THIS PIECE OF TRASH, DODGE AND ITS EMPLOYEES WOULD BE OUT OF BUSINESS.  I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER DODGE VEHICLE.",
