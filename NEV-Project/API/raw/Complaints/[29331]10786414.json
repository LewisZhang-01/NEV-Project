        "summary": "ON 10/18/2015, WHILE FLAT TOWING MY 2014 JEEP CHEROKEE AT APPROXIMATELY 60 MPH ON I-5 NEAR SAN CLEMENTE, CA BEHIND OUR RV, WE SUDDENLY EXPERIENCED A VIOLENT SIDE TO SIDE SWERVING SENSATION.  WHILE WORKING TO CONTROL THE RV, I VIEWED VIA THE REAR CAMERA, THE CHEROKEE ROCKING SIDE TO SIDE, VIOLENTLY SHAKING THE RV.  THE 2014 JEEP CHEROKEE IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO BE FLAT TOWED BEHIND THE RV, AND WAS CONNECTED TO THE RV WITH A BLUE-OX TOWING SYSTEM.  I HAD PREVIOUSLY TOWED THE JEEP CHEROKEE APPROXIMATELY 14,000 MILES PRIOR TO THIS EVENT WITH NO PROBLEMS.  THE VIOLENT SWAYING CONTINUED THROUGH THE BRAKING PROCESS, AND DID NOT CEASE UNTIL THE VEHICLE CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP.  AFTER STOPPING ON I-5, A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION DID NOT IDENTIFY AN OBVIOUS CAUSE SUCH AS A FLAT/SOFT TIRE ON THE RV OR JEEP, LOOSE OR DAMAGED TOW BAR. I SLOWLY EXITED THE INTERSTATE AND PARKED IN A SAFE LOCATION FOR A CLOSER INSPECTION.  TURNING THE JEEP'S IGNITION TO \"ON\" WITHOUT STARTING, I NOTICED MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND ELECTRONIC STABILITYCONTROL LIGHT WERE ILLUMINATED.  AFTER CHECKING VARIOUS RV FORUMS, I DISCOVERED THAT OTHERS WITH 2014 JEEP CHEROKEES HAD EXPERIENCED THE SAME ISSUE WHICH SEEMS TO RESOLVE ITSELF AFTER STOPPING THE VEHICLE.  I CONTINUED ON MY JOURNEY WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS AND  THE WARNING LIGHTS ON MY DASH RESET WITHIN A DAY OR SO.  IT APPEARS TO BE A UNIQUE PROBLEM TO 2014 JEEP CHEROKEES ACCORDING TO VARIOUS RV FORUMS.  MY 2014 JEEP CHEROKEE IS EQUIPPED WITH THE ACTIVE DRIVE II TRANSMISSION SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR FLAT TOWING BEHIND MY RV.",
