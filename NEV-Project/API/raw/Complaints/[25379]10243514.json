SINCE 99% OF THE TIME WE ALL USE THE BUTTON TO LOCK AND UNLOCK DOORS, USING THE MANUAL LOCKING LEVER IS UNFAMILIAR. AND THE MURANO'S DESIGN IS SUCH THAT IT'S NOT EASY TO COMPREHEND IF IT'S NOT YOUR CAR, FOR INSTANCE A RENTAL CAR. I CAN EASILY UNDERSTAND HOW SOME PEOPLE WOULD BE CONFUSED HOW UNLOCK A DOOR USING THE MANUAL LEVEL IN AN EMERGENCY WHEN THEY VIRTUALLY HAVE NO EXPERIENCE WITH IT. IN EMERGENCIES EVERY SECOND COUNTS. THE LOCKING/UNLOCKING SOLENOID MALFUNCTIONING IS CLEARLY A HIGH RISK IN EMERGENCY SCENARIOS. SOME PEOPLE WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE $1600 TO HAVE ALL THE SOLENOIDS REPLACED (AS QUOTED BY DEALERS) WILL FORGO GETTING THEM FIXED, PUTTING THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AT RISK WITH THE ABOVE MISHAP EXAMPLES. THIS SHOULDN'T BE, NISSAN SHOULD RECALL THEM. *TR",
