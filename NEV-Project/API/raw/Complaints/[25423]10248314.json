CAR HAS BEEN SITTING IN DRIVE WAY FOR 2 MONTHS BECAUSE WE CAN NOT AFFORD TO DISH OUT $600 RIGHT NOW. I CALLED GM AND THEY SAID WE PAY FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC THEY MAY BE ABLE TO HELP WITH REPAIR. I KNOW IT IS A LONG SHOT BUT WORTH A TRY. IF THEY DO NOT PAY FOR REPAIR IT WILL BE ANOTHER 2 MONTHS BEFORE WE CAN GET OUR CAR BACK BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE TO PAY A LITTLE OUT OF EACH PAYCHECK. THERE GOES CHRISTMAS. *TR",
