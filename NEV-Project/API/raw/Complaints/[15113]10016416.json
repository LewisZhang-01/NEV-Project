        "summary": "I HAVE A FORD TARUS 2000, WITH 41,000 MILES, MY WIFE WENT TO DRIVE THE CAR AND BEFORE SHE STARTED THE CAR -THE CAR WAS STATIONARY- THERE WAS AN EXPLOSIVE SOUND IN THE FRONT DUE TO THE LEFT FRONT TIRE BLOWING OUT. I RAISED THE CAR WITH A JACK AND FOUND THE COIL SPRING HAD BROKEN APART AND WAS EMBEDDED IN THE TIRE. HAD SOMEONE BEEN DRIVING THE CAR AT 70 MPH IT IS QUITE LIKELY THE CAR WOULD HAVE ROLLED OVER.  IF A SPRING FAILURE DOES HAPPEN WHILE THE CAR IS AT DRIVING VELOCITY AND CAUSES THE CAR TO WRECK IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, THE BROKEN SPRING WILL BE SEEN AS A RESULT OF THE CRASH AND NOT AS THE CAUSE OF THE CRASH.  THE FORD PEOPLE TOLD ME THERE IS NO RECALL AND THAT THEY ARE ALLOWED 1% FAILURE RATE BEFORE A RECALL IS INITIATED. THE SPRING IS VERY CRITICAL TO STEERING AND TO ALLOW 10,000 FAILURES, A POSSIBLE 10,000 FATALITIES PER MILLION IS UNACCEPTABLE.    *JB",
