WHEN I AM IN NEUTRAL OR IN GEAR WITH THE CLUTCH ALL THE WAY IN, AND ALSO WHEN I AM JUST DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD,  ENGINE WILL REV FOR NO REASON.  I NOTICE THAT MY ENGINE IS REVVING HIGHER THAN USUAL.  WHEN I STOP IT WILL GO FROM 1000 RPMS TO 3000 RPMS AND WILL STAY THAT WAY UNTIL I CUT OFF, AND WILL SOMETIMES JUST DROP BACK DOWN TO 1000 ALL WHILE I AM JUST SITTING THERE.  I HAVE GONE TO THE SATURN DEALER A FEW TIMES AND TO 2 OTHER GARAGES IN MY AREAS.  THE HAVE SAID THAT THEY HAVE CHECKED EVERYTHING AND COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG AND FOR ME JUST TO CUT OFF THE ENGINE IF IT REVS TO HIGH.  THAT IS THE ONLY ADVISE THAT I WAS GIVEN.  I EMAILED THE SATURN HEADQUARTERS AND THEY ADVISED ME TO DO THE SAME THING.  I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE NORMAL ACTIVITY OF A CAR. I AM CURRENTLY A COLLEGE STUDENT WORKING PART TIME AND I CAN NOT TAKE A CHANCE THAT THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH MY CAR OR THAT THE CAR DIES ALL TOGETHER.  *AK",
