        "summary": "ON MAY 12, 2003 AT 3:30PM, I WAS ABOUT TO DRIVE ONTO INTERSTATE 5 TOWARD ROSEVILLE WHEN THREE OUT OF FOUR BOLTS, THAT ATTACH THE DRIVER\u0019S SEAT INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE VEHICLE, CAME UNBOLTED.  THE DRIVER\u0019S SEAT FELL BACK INTO THE BACK SEAT PASSENGER AREA. I WAS DRIVING BY MYSELF AND WAS UNABLE TO REACH THE STEERING WHEEL OR THE GAS AND BREAK PETALS. I WAS SOMEHOW ABLE TO STOP THE VEHICLE AND GET TO SAFETY. THE VEHICLE WAS IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT TO LASHER VW. JOHN YOUNG AND STAFF STATED SEVERAL TIMES THAT THEY CONSIDER THIS NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR FOR A VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE DRIVER SIDE SEAT. I CONTACTED VW THE CORPORATION AND WAS TOLD ALSO BY A VW ADVOCATE THAT THIS IS NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR FOR THIS VEHICLE.  LASHER VW DID NOT REPLACE THE BOLTS. I AM NOT SURE HOW SAFE THE VEHICLE IS TO DRIVE CURRENTLY. ALL VW REPRESENTATIVES THAT I WAS IN CONTACT WITH DID NOT CONSIDERED THE DRIVER SIDE SEAT BEING UNBOLTED A SERIOUS OR HAZARDOUS PROBLEM. I COULD HAVE KILLED SEVERAL PEOPLE AS WELL AS MYSELF HAD I MADE IT ONTO THE INTERSTATE. THIS IS A TRUE AND VALID CONCERN AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE ADDRESSED AS SUCH BY YOUR REGULATORY AGENCY.  *NLM",
