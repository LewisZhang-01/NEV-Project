        "summary": "I NOTICED THAT MY PASSENGER AIRBAG OFF INDICATOR LIGHT WAS ILLUMINATED WHEN I WAS SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. IT WOULD HAPPEN INTERMITTENTLY. NISSAN ISSUED A RECALL FOR THE AIRBAG AND I TOOK THE CAR IN TO HAVE IT SERVICED AND ASSUMED IT WAS A RELATED ISSUE. AFTER THE RECALL WAS COMPLETED, THE SAME ISSUE OF THE LIGHT OCCURRED INTERMITTENTLY. I RETURNED THE CAR TO NISSAN WHO REPLACED THE ENTIRE AIRBAG MODULE. AFTER THAT, I STILL NOTICED THE LIGHT WOULD INTERMITTENTLY BE ON WHILE THERE WAS A PASSENGER IN THE SEAT. SPECIFICALLY, MYSELF OR MY DAUGHTER. BOTH OF US ARE 110-120 LB ADULTS. I AGAIN RETURNED THE CAR TO NISSAN WHO ADMITTED THAT THERE IS NO DEFINITE WEIGHT THAT WILL ACTIVATE THE AIRBAG AND THE 110-120 RANGE IS INDETERMINATE.  THE SUGGESTION WAS THAT I PULL OVER AND RESTART THE CAR TO RESET THE SYSTEM TO RECOGNIZE A PASSENGER IN THE SEAT.  I AM UNABLE TO ESTABLISH ANY PATTERN OF WHAT CAUSES IT TO HAPPEN. IT SEEMS VERY RANDOM. OCCASIONALLY WHEN AT A STOP LIGHT, THE CAR WILL RECALCULATE AND ACTIVATE THE AIRBAG.  I WOULD ESTIMATE 40% OF THE TIME A PASSENGER IS IN THE SEAT, THE LIGHT ILLUMINATES TO INDICATE THE AIRBAG IS OFF. I FEEL THIS IS A FAULTY AND DANGEROUS DESIGN. NO ONE DISCLOSED WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR I MAY NOT HAVE AIRBAG PROTECTION.  INITIALLY I WAS TOLD THE WEIGHT SETTING WAS ANYTHING GREATER THAN 70LBS WOULD ACTIVATE THE AIRBAG WHICH IS REASONABLE TO PROTECT SMALLER INFANT PASSENGERS THAT SHOULDN'T BE IN THE FRONT SEAT TO BEGIN WITH. BUT ADULTS AND TEENS OVER 70LBS SHOULD HAVE RELIABLE AND CONSISTENT AIRBAG PROTECTION.  I DO HAVE VIDEOS OF MYSELF IN THE PASSENGER SEAT WITH THE AIRBAG LIGHT WHILE WE ARE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY IF NEEDED. I AM DISAPPOINTED AND SHOCKED NISSAN DOES NOT FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN.",
