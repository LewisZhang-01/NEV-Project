VEHICLE LURCHED \"LIKE IT HAD HIT A BOX\" WHILE ACCELERATING FROM A STOP SIGN.  VEHICLE WAS IMMEDIATELY STOPPED TO CHECK FOR ANY DEBRIS; NONE FOUND.  UPON RE-ENTERING VEHICLE, IT COULD NOT BE DRIVEN FORWARD IN \"DRIVE.\"  VEHICLE COULD ONLY BE DRIVEN IN \"REVERSE\" GEAR.  VEHICLE TOWED TO FORD DEALERSHIP AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT ENTIRE TRANSMISSION NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.    PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE WAS PERFORMED ON THE TRANSMISSION BY SAME FORD DEALERSHIP IN NOVEMBER 2002.    TWO OF OUR IN-LAWS ALSO OWN 1999 FORD WINDSTARS, ONE OF WHOM IS NOW ON IT'S THIRD TRANSMISSION, AND THE OTHER IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING OCCASIONAL \"SLIPPING\" OF THE TRANSMISSION DURING ACCELERATION.   *NLM",
