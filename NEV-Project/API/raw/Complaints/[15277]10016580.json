THE BRAKE ROTORS FOR THE 1999 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE LAREDO ARE NO GOOD AND WARP WITHIN 3 TO 6,000 MILES. THE OPERATORS AS WELL AS OTHER DRIVERS ARE PUT IN DANGER WHEN THE VEHICLE GOES OUT OF CONTROL AS THE WHEEL IS PULLED FROM YOUR HANDS AND SWERVES AS THE STEERING WHEEL VIBRATES. THE DEALERS DO NOT OFFER ANY PERMANENT REPAIRS AND CHARGE THE CUSTOMER TO TURN THE ROTORS AGAIN AND AGAIN.  WITH EACH EPISODE OTHERS ARE PUT IN DANGER, AGAIN AND AGAIN.  I GUESS SOMEDAY WE'LL HAVE TO REPLACE THE NHTSA WITH A JAPANESE GROUP TOO, BECAUSE YOU ARE ABOUT AS EFFECTIVE AS THE AMERICAN AUTO MFGRS IN CAUSING AN IMPROVEMENT.     *NLM",
