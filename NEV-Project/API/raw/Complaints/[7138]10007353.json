FOR WHATEVER REASON, THERE IS A DEFECT IN THE THRUST WASHERS THAT CAUSE THERE TO BE AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF PLAY IN THE CRANKSHAFT. THIS CAUSES WHAT HAD BEEN TERMED THE \"CRANKSHAFT WALK\". AMONG OTHER SYMPTOMS, COMMON AND WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CAR WAS THAT THE 5 SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSION STARTED TO LOCK UP ON ME WHERE I COULD NOT EVEN GET THE CAR IN GEAR. THE MOVEMENT IN THE CRANKSHAFT CAUSED THE CRANKSHAFT POSITIONING SENSOR TO GO OUT, AND WHEN IT DID, I  WAS DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AT 65 MPH AND THE CAR SHUT OFF ON ME CAUSING ME TO LOSE MY POWER BRAKES AND STEERING. I DID NOT GET INTO AN ACCIDENT, BUT I COULD HAVE. I HAD THE THRUST WASHER REPLACED AND NOW HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. I AM NOT ALONE. THE FOLLOWING IS A WEBSITE THAT CONTAINS POST AFTER POST OF THE SAME PROBLEM.    PH   *NLM    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**767675",
