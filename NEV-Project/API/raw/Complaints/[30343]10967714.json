WHEN CALLING CHRYSLER TO ASK WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT THIS. WE WERE TOLD TO 1, NOT DRIVE THE VEHICLE OR 2 NOT TO LET ANYONE SIT IN THE PASSENGER SIDE. THAT METAL SHRAPNEL COULD SERIOUSLY INJURE OR KILL SOMEONE IF WE WERE IN AN ACCIDENT. SERIOUSLY!!!! WE HAVE CONTACTED CHRYSLER SEVERAL TIMES ASKING WHY THEY ARE NOT FIXING THIS OR RECALLING THE VEHICLE BEFORE SERIOUS INJURIES OCCUR. THE BEST THEY COULD DO WAS GIVE US A CODE TO PURCHASE A NEW VEHICLE AT COST BUT GUESS WHAT. THERE IS NO DEALERSHIP THAT WILL TAKE MY CURRENT VEHICLE WITH A RECALL THAT CAN NOT BE FIXED AND RESALE IT. SO PRETTY MUCH I AM STUCK IN A LOAN WITH A VEHICLE THAT COULD INJURE OR KILL MYSELF, KIDS, HUSBAND, ETC. THIS SHOULD BE ILLEGAL FOR CHRYSLER TO DO!!",
