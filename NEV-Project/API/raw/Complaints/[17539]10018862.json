IN DECEMBER OF 2002 SOMEONE TOLD US THAT THE GASKETS WERE NOTED FOR LEAKING.  MY HUSBAND REPLACED IT, AND GAVE IT AN OIL CHANGE IN FEB. IT WAS THICK AND DARK ORANGE IN COLOR. IT STARTED KNOCKING WHEN YOU ACCELERATED. SO ONCE AGAIN MY HUSBAND HAS IT TORN APART AND FOUND THE CRANK SHAFT IS COMING APART DUE TO THE ANTIFREEZE LEAKING INTO THE ENGINE. NOW I AM PAYING ON A DEAD HORSE. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GET IT REPAIRED. IT WOULD BE NICE IF GM WOULD RECALL THIS. *JB",
