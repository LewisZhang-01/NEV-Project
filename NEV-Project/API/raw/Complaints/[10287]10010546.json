I HAD TO LET MY VEHICLE SIT FOR NINE MONTHS NOT BEING ABLE TO DRIVE IT AND YET STILL MAKING PAYMENTS ON IT BEFORE I COULD AFFORD TO REPLACE TO THE MOTOR. SO 3 WEEKS AGO I HAD THE MOTOR REPLACED AND NOW MY TRANSMISSION HAS GONE AGAIN. SUPPOSEDLY IT WAS REPLACED WITH A FACTORY REBUILT TRANSMISSION THE FIRST TIME AROUND. THIS SERIOUSLY UPSETS ME THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAS GONE AGAIN. I STILL OWE 2 AND 1/2 YEARS OF PAYMENTS ON THIS VEHICLE AND I AM BACK TO I CANNOT DRIVE IT AGAIN BECAUSE I CANNOT AFFORD TO GET IT FIXED. I WAS TOLD OF SOME FACTORY PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSIONS AND I WONDERED IF THIS COULD BE THE REASON THAT MY VEHICLE IS OUT OF COMMISSION AGAIN. FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THIS USED VEHICLE IS COSTING ME I WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF TO BUY A NEW ONE. THE VEHICLE IS A 1998 DODGE CARAVAN.     *NLM",
