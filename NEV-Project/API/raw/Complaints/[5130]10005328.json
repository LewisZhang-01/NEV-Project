VW HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THEY HAVE A COIL PROBLEM BUT HAS REFUSED TO REPLACE THE REMAINING COIL STATING THAT THEY WILL NOT REPLACE IT UNTIL IT FAILS.  WITH THE HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT THIS COIL WILL FAIL JUST LIKE THE OTHERS WHICH WERE INSTALLED AT THE SAME TIME, VW'S ATTITUDE SHOWS A COMPLETE LACK OF REGARD FOR THEIR CUSTOMER'S SAFETY.  FORTUNATELY, UP TO NOW THE FAILURES HAVE ONLY COST ME TIME AND FRUSTRATION.  UNTIL VW CAN DO THE RIGHT THING, I FEEL LIKE I'M DRIVING A TICKING TIME BOMB.",
