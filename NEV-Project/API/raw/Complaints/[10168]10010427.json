THE PROBLEM TURNED OUT TO BE RELATED TO THE TIMING BELT. APPARENTLY THE TIMING BELT TENSIONER FAILED, CAUSING THE TIMING BELT TO GO INTO THE ENGINE AND DAMAGE CYLINDER HEADS. MY LOCAL MECHANIC HAS INFORMED ME THE MANUFACTURER HAS ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN THAT RECOMMENDS REPLACING THE PART. I HAD THE PART INSPECTED AT 55,000 MILES BY MY LOCAL DEALER AND WAS NOT TOLD OF THE PROBLEM OR ADVISED TO REPLACE THE PART. AT 66,000 MILES, THE PART FAILED, CAUSING THE ENGINE FAILURE DURING HIGHWAY DRIVING. THE MANUFACTURER IS REFUSING TO COVER THE COST OF REPAIR, STATING THAT THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY AS I AM NOT THE ORIGINAL OWNER.   *JB",
