        "summary": "2001 GRAND VITARA XL-7 4WD, FUEL LINE FEED (PIPE) TO THROTTLE BODY HAD CRACK CAUSEING GAS TO LEAK ONTO ENGINE. FUEL PIPE IS LOCATED ON REAR OF THROTTLE BODY, LEFT SIDE (LOOKING FROM FRONT), TOWARDS FIREWALL. GAS LINE HAS \"BANJO\" FITTING WITH BANJO BOLT HOLDING LINE ONTO THROTTLE BODY. GAS LEAKS ONTO FITTING AND DROPS ONTO ENGINE. STRONG SMELL OF GAS IN CAB OF VEHICLE DURING WARM-UP AND AT IDLE. ONCE IN MOTION SMELL IS NOT AS STRONG IF AT ALL. SMELL IS REALLY BAD DURING SUMMER (WARMER) DAYS. REPLACEMENT OF THIS FUEL PIPE APPEARS TO HAVE CURED THE PROBLEM. PROBLEM FIRST NOTICED AROUND JULY 2002. FIRST VISITS TO DEALERSHIP PRODUCED NO RESULTS WITH THEIR EFFORT TO LOCATE SOURCE OF SMELL. SEVERAL ATTEMPTS MADE AT TIGHTING GAS BYPASS LINES, EVAPORATOR LINES, VACUUM LINES, ETC. ALL UP FRONT, ON THE ENGINE. I FOUND LEAK BY SEARCHING FOR STRONGEST LOCATION OF SMELL, AT IDLE, ENGINE WARM, IN PARKING LOT. ONCE FOUND, SAW DROPS OF GASOLINE COMING FROM FUEL PIPE. NOTIFIED DEALERSHIP AND PROBLEM WAS FIXED BY REPLACEMENT OF FUEL PIPE WITHIN TWO DAYS.",
