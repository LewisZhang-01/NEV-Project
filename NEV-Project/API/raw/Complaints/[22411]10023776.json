        "summary": "I DRIVE A 2002 PONTIAC GRAND PRIX GT.  THIS CAR COMES EQUIPPED WITH A PASS-THROUGH FROM THE BACK SEAT TO THE TRUNK.  IT LOCKS FROM THE INSIDE.  WHEN YOU STOP HARD, TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT, OR BECAUSE OF TRAFFIC, ITEMS FROM THE TRUNK COME CRASHING INTO THE CABIN OF THE CAR.  THE PASS-THROUGH LOCK IS STILL IN THE \"LOCKED\" POSITION AND ITEMS FROM THE TRUNK END UP BEING PROJECTED INTO THE BACK SEAT, AND I FEAR, IF THE STOP IS HARD ENOUGH, THAT THE ITEMS IN THE TRUNK MIGHT ACTUALLY END UP IN THE FRONT SEAT, EITHER HITTING THE DRIVER, OR HITTING THE GEAR SHIFT KNOB.  THIS CAN BE A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION BECAUSE I ALMOST HAD A WRECK WHEN IT HAPPENED BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.  IF REAR-ENDED OR BRAKING HARD, THIS HAPPENS, ITEMS IN THE TRUNK CAN DO SERIOUS DAMAGE TO THE DRIVER OR PASSENGER, OR COULD ACTUALLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT WHEN THE PASS-THROUGH FAILS.  THE LOCK IS MADE OF CHEAP METAL THAT BENDS AND IT LOCKS INTO A CHEAP PLASTIC GROOVE.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THEY ARE ALL MADE THE SAME WAY AND NOTHING CAN BE DONE.  I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS PROBLEM COULD CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE TO AN OCCUPANT OF THE CAR, OR COULD EVEN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT IF IT WERE TO  HAPPEN (IT SCARED ME TO DEATH WHEN IT HAPPENED BECAUSE IT MADE A LOUD CRASHING SOUND).  I CARRY A BOWLING BALL IN MY TRUNK.  THE LAST THING I NEED IS A 16 POUND BOWLING BALL TO COME CRASHING INTO THE CABIN OF THE CAR.  PONTIAC (GM) NEEDS TO RE-ENGINEER THIS AND MAKE IT SAFER FOR DRIVERS.    *NLM",
