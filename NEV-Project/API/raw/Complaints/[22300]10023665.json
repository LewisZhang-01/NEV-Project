LESS THAN 3000 MILES ON ALL TIRES.  CARLISLE BRAND TIRES CONTINUE TO BLOW OUT, REPLACEMENT TIRES WORK OK SO FAR.  AIR PRESSURE CHECKED EACH TRIP, TIRES KEPT OUT OF DIRECT SUNLIGHT AND TRAILER NOT OVERWEIGHT.  CALLED TRAILER DEALER AND THEY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TIRE, ALTHOUGH THEY SELL IT WITH THIS TIRE.  VERY UNHAPPY AND CONCERNED FOR FAMILY SAFETY.  BUYING 5 NEW TIRES OF ANOTHER BRAND TODAY.  *JB",
