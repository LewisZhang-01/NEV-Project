THE FIRST TIME THERE WAS EXTENSIVE DAMAGE.  THE AIR BAG AND PCM MODULES WERE DAMAGED BY THE HEATER CORE LEAK.  THERE ALSO WAS A FIRE FROM THE PCM AND AIR BAG MODULE.  THIS DAMAGE COST $1500.  THE DEALER WILL NOT FIX THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY BY 3 MONTHS.  I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT THERE ARE MANY CARS THAT ARE EXPIERENCING THIS PROBLEM.",
