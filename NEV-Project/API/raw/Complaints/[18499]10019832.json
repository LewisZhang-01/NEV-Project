TRIED TO TAKE IT OUT OF GEAR RESULTING IN THE ENGINE JUST REVVING UP. PUT IT BACK INTO GEAR AND IT CONTINUED RACING AND ACCELERATING. THE ONLY WAY WAS TO HIT THE BRAKE AND SLOW DOWN TO THE CURB ON A PRETTY BUSY HIGHWAY. THIS WAS A DANGEROUS SITUATION. TOOK IT INTO THE BMW DEALERSHIP WHO WANTED A LOAD OF MONEY TO INVESTIGATE. HAVE NOT USED CRUISE SINCE THEN. I THINK THERE IS A MANUFACTURER FLAW AND SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED BY BMW. ONCE AGAIN, THIS CAN BE AND WAS VERY DANGEROUS. I FORGOT THE INCIDENT AND TRIED IT AGAIN THAT RESULTED IN EXACTLY THE SAME FAILURE.  *CB",
