I WAS DRIVING HOME, THE ABS LIGHT CAME ON, AND I NOTICED A HUMMING NOISE, EVEN AFTER THE IGNITION WAS TURNED OFF. I HAD TO REMOVE THE 60 AMP FUSE FROM THE FUSE CENTER TO TURN OFF THE ABS MODULE. I AM TOLD THAT THE REPAIR COST IS APPROXIMATELY $1000.  I CAN'T AFFORD THE REPAIR COST AND NOW I AM DRIVING WITHOUT ABS. THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE SILVERADOS AND GM WILL NOT DO ANYTHING. THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS THROUGH OUT THE WEB.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE INVOLVING THE BRAKING SYSTEM. TS",
