MY REAR GLASS BROKE OFF OF THE LIFTGATE GLASS HINGE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE. IT ONLY REMAINED ATTACHED BY THE DRIVER SIDE HINGE. IT APPEARS THAT CORROSION/RUST OCCURRED BECAUSE IT WAS NOT SEALED OR WATER GOT IN SOMEHOW. I AM VERY THANKFUL THIS DID NOT HAPPEN WHILE DRIVING BECAUSE IF IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN FROM BOTH, IT WOULD CERTAINLY DETACH AND BREAK ON THE ROADWAY.",
