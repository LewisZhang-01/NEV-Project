IT HAPPENED WITHOUT WARNING, I WAS DRIVING WHEN I NOTICED A LOUD RUMBLE AND VIBRATION UNDER MY FEET WHEN TURNING THE WHEEL SLIGHTLY,  I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO MY MECHANIC AN WAS SURPRISED WHEN HE PUT IT ON THE RACK AND BOTH WHEELS ROCKED BACK AND FORTH!! THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT HAD THEY LET GO WHILE TRAVELING 50MPH. JUST WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM? MY HUSBAND CALLED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE WE LEASED IT TO SEE IF THEY HAD ANY COMPLAINTS AND THEY REALLY DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE. WE JUST FEEL AT 56,000 HIGHWAY MILES THESE SHOULD HAVE PLENTLY OF LIFE IN THEM YET.",
