        "summary": "IN NOVEMBER 2002, I DISCOVERED A PROBLEM WITH MY AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION IN MY 2001 HONDA ACCORD. SUBSEQUENT TO THIS DATE I  HAD THREE TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENTS, ALL UNSUCCESSFUL. TWO OF MY TRANSMISSIONS DID NOT LAST LONGER THAN A WEEK BEFORE THEY WERE DIAGNOSED WITH TRANSMISSION FAILURE. HONDA IS UNWILLING TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM AND HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO REACH. THE SERVICE STAFF CONTINUALLY TRIES TO TELL ME THAT THE PROBLEM IS \"IN MY HEAD\", YET THEY CONTINUE TO REPLACE MY TRANSMISSION UNIT ON EACH VISIT. IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOUR 2001/2002 MODEL PLEASE FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE BBB AUTO LINE, THE BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR, OR THE NEW MOTOR VEHICLE BOARD, THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THAT HONDA WILL BECOME RESPONSIVE TO THIS PROBLEM.   ALTHOUGH THEY EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON ALL TRANSMISSION TO 100,000 MILES, THIS ONLY COVERS 100,000 MILES ON THE ODOMETER NOT ON THE LIFE OF THE NEW TRANSMISSION. HOW CAN I MAKE HONDA ACCOUNTABLE FOR MY UNSAFE VEHICLE? THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIVE IN ANY WAY! *JB",
