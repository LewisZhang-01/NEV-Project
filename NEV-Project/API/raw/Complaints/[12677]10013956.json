HYUNDAI SAYS THIS IS WHAT THEY PROVIDE NOW IF YOU WANT A NEW MIRROR...MY OTHER SIDE MIRROR IS A CLEAR MIRROR AND THIS WORKS FINE.  HYUNDAI TOLD ME THEY DO NOT HAVE CLEAR MIRRORS ANYMORE.  I HAVE FOUND, IN THE 2 DAYS I HAVE HAD THE NEW TINTED MIRROR THAT THE VIEW IS HARDER TO SEE BECAUSE EVERYTHING LOOKS AS THOUGH I WAS WEARING SUNGLASSES AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY HARD ON A GREY OR RAINY DAY.  THIS CANNOT BE A SAFE ACCESSORY... AND WHAT OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE GOOD VISION?  THE DARKENED  MIRROR IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY DISASTER.  I AM GOING TO WRITE TO CEO HYUNDAI FINBARR O'NEIL TODAY IN THE CALIFORNIA HYUNDAI AMERICA OFFICE.  CAN YOU GUYS HELP ME OUT HERE??  ALSO WOULD LIKE THEM TO SEARCH THEIR WAREHOUSES FOR A CLEAR MIRROR.",
