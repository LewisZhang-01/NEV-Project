THE BREAK ISSUES EXPERIENCED HAVE BEEN BRAKE LIGHTS TURNING ON, BRAKES SHUDDERING, THE TRUCK NOT BRAKING PROPERLY, BRAKES NOT WORKING UNTIL THE PEDAL WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY PRESSED.  RECENTLY THE TRUCK FAILED TO STOP RESULTING IN A REAR END COLLISION.  THE DEALER HAS REPLACED/RESURFACED ROTORS, BRAKE PADS AND REPLACED SENSORS DURING THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF.  HOWEVER, I CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE ISSUE AFTER ISSUE REGARDING THE BRAKES.  I HAVE HAD OTHER DEFECTS AS WELL, BUT THE BRAKE ISSUES HAVE BEEN THE PRIMARY ISSUE.  *NM",
