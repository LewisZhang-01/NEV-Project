THE PROBLEM IS VERY  TO BE INTERNAL TO THE SHIFTER ASSEMBLY. THERE IS A PINK PLASTIC ARM WHERE THE IGNITION INTERLOCK CABLE ATTACHES IN THE SHIFTER. THIS ARM IS SPRING LOADED AND CAN EVENTUALLY BREAK. WHEN IT DOES THEN YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO MOVE THE SHIFTER FROM PARK BECAUSE THE SHIFTER DOESN'T KNOW THE KEY IS TURNED ON. THE DEALERSHIP WANT TO CHARGE TO KEEP REPLACING IT WHICH MIND YOU IS NOT COVER UNDER WARRENTY. I HAVE TALKED TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM ALSO.  *TR",
