I WAS MADE AWARE OF THE RECALL VIA THE LOCAL NEWS STATION AND WAS DIRECTED TO THE NHTSA WEBSITE, WHERE I LOOKED UP THE VIN ON MY CAR AND CONFIRMED THE RECALL. I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP MECHANIC AND WAS INFORMED I WOULD RECEIVE A CALL BACK WITH IF THEY HAD THE PART AND WHEN IT COULD BE REPLACED. 4 DAYS LATER (TODAY) I GET THE CALL AND WAS TOLD THAT THE PARTS ARE ON BACK ORDER. THIS UPSET ME BECAUSE IT IS A SERIOUS REPLACEMENT. I DRIVE 500 MILES TO WORK ON THE INTERSTATE A WEEK! THIS IS A BRAND NEW CAR, ONLY 6 MONTHS OLD, WITH A $450 A MONTH PRICE TAG (THE WHOLE PRIORITY FOR LIFE). I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE THE CAR WAS BROUGHT AND WAS TOLD THAT CARS GET RECALLS ALL THE TIME AND THAT THIS WASN'T A BIG DEAL. THOUGH THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO UNTIL THEY COULD GET THE PARTS. THIS IS A SERIOUS HIGHWAY RISK AND AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE, FROM A MANUFACTURER THAT CLAIMS TO ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK!!!!!!! I COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF WITH A USED VEHICLE. I'M GUESSING THE MANUFACTURER IS OK WITH UNSAFE VEHICLES BEING OUT ON THE ROADWAY. IF THESE SPRINGS BREAK AND I GET IN AN ACCIDENT, YOU CAN BE SURE THAT I WILL CONTACT A LAWYER.",
