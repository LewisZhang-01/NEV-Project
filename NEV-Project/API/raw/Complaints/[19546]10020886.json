THIS MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO DRIVE WHEN IT REALLY RAINS OR EVEN NIGHT TIME RAINY WEATHER. OVER THE PAST YEAR OR SO, NOW IT EVEN DOES IT WHEN IT SNOWED OUT. THIS HAS HAPPENED WELL OVER 10 TIMES IN THE PAST 4 YEARS THAT I HAVE OWNED THIS VEHICLE. I HAVE TAKEN IT IN TO SEVERAL CHEVY DEALERSHIPS AND THEY ALL SAY THE SAME THING \"NOTHING SEEMS TO BE WRONG HERE. JUST KEEP AN EYE ON IT AND LET US KNOW IF WE CAN HELP YOU WITH ANYTHING ELSE...\" I FEEL THAT THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT MY CAR, SEEING THAT I AM FEMALE. I GET THIS IMPRESSION BECAUSE THEY ONLY TOOK ABOUT 5 MINUTES TO LOOK AT IT AND CAME TO THAT CONCLUSION. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO, SEEING NOW THAT MY CAR IS WAY OUT OF WARRANTY.  *AK",
