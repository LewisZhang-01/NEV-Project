        "summary": "I HAVE A 2006 BMW 330I E90, THE VIN# IS [XXX]. MY PCV VALVE HAS FAILED AND ABSOLUTELY MELTED THROUGH. THE PLASTIC HOUSING IS ENTIRELY MELTED, AND THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR AND WIRES ARE MELTED THROUGH. LUCKILY I LIVE IN COLORADO AND IT IS VERY COLD HERE IN FEBRUARY AND THE CAR DID NOT CATCH ON FIRE.     I STARTED DOING RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET ON THE PART AND FOUND BMW RECALL 17V-683. I FOUND THE ATTACHED RECALL DOCUMENT AND HIGHLIGHTED THE RELEVANT SECTION IN GREEN, WHERE ON PAGE 11 ( OR PAGE 1 OF THE FAQ SECTION) IT SAYS THE RECALL IS FOR E90 MODELS PRODUCED STARTING IN JULY 2006; MY CAR WAS PRODUCED JUNE 13, 2006. I CALLED BMW CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER AND WAS TOLD THAT MY CAR WAS NOT IN THE RECALL AND IT WAS A COINCIDENCE THAT THE EXACT SAME PART MELTED, AS WHAT WAS BEING RECALLED FOR CARS BUILT ONLY TWO WEEKS LATER. I DON'T THINK SO. HOW CAN BMW SAY THAT BECAUSE MY CAR WAS BUILT TWO WEEKS PRIOR THAT THEY KNOW FOR A FACT, THAT A GOOD PCV VALVE WAS INSTALLED IN MY CAR? WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE BAD PCV VALVES ARE MELTING. AND I CAN CERTAINLY PROVE THAT MINE HAS MELTED.     SO, A RESPONSIBLE COMPANY WOULD SEE THIS AS A SAFETY CONCERN AND NOT A COINCIDENCE. I GUESS WE WILL SEE HOW BMW HANDLES BUT SINCE THEY NOW HAVE DOCUMENTED PROOF THAT THIS ISSUE AFFECTED A VEHICLE BUILT PRIOR TO JULY, I URGE THEM TO CHANGE THE RECALL DATE FROM JULY 2006 TO JUNE 2006. BESIDE ME WANTING MY CAR REPAIRS COVERED, THERE COULD BE OTHER 2006 VEHICLES BUILT MID-JUNE THAT WILL HAVE THIS ISSUE AND SEEING THE AMOUNT OF MELTING THIS DID TO MY CAR, IT COULD CAUSE A FIRE IN THE VEHICLE AND CAUSE HARM TO INNOCENT PEOPLE. I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE THE CAR TO A BMW DEALERSHIP FOR THEM TO CONFIRM THE FAILED/MELTED PCV VALVE. I JUST WANT MY CAR FIXED AND THE RECALL DATE CHANGE TO JUNE 2006 FROM JULY 2006, SO THAT OTHERS ARE MADE AWARE OF THE DANGER.
