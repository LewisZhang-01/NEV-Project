THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE DEALER MANY TIMES AND THEY HAVE MADE THE SITUATION BETTER BY WRAPPING FOAM AROUND THE HEATERBOX AND AIRCONDITIONING DUCTWORK BUT YOUR LEGS STILL GET VERY COLD ON COLD DAYS WHILLE SETTING ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  THEY'VE JUST TOLD ME THAT THERE IS NOTHING ELSE THEY CAN DO UNLESS GM SENDS THEM A REDESIGNED/IMPROVED PART THAT CORRECTS THE PROBLEM.  I FIND IT UNACCEPTABLE THAT A $30,000 TRUCK CANNOT PROVIDE A COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR ITS OWNERS WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY ON A COLD NIGHT AND IT SEEMS THAT GM MAY NOT BE WILLING TO DO ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THIS.  WHILE DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE WITH THE DEALER SERVICE TECH. HE MENTIONED THAT MANY OF THE SILVERADOS, TAHOES AND YUKONS HAVE THIS SAME PROBLEM AND ALL THE DEALER CAN DO IS WRAP THE HEATER AND DUCTWORK WITH THE FOAM AS THEY'VE ALREADY DONE TO MINE UNTIL GM DECIDES TO ACTUALLY FIX THE PROBLEM.",
