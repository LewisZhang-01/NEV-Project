THE VEHICLE WOULD SHIFT IN AND OUT OF 2WD AND 4WD ON IT'S OWN AND ON OCCASION IT WOULD LOCK THE WHEELS ALSO.  PROBLEM MOSTLY OCCURED WHEN MAKING TURNS.  STATED PROBLEM TO DEALER (10/18/02) - DEALER REPLACED 4WD SELECTOR SWITCH (REASON: INTERNALLY SHORTED).  HAD PROBLEM AGAIN IN MONTH OF FEB. '03. BROUGHT VEHICLE BACK TO THE SAME DEALER AND EXPLAINED PROBLEM AGAIN (02/21/03).  DEALER REPLACED 4WD SELECTOR SWITCH AGAIN. REASON WHY I'M FILING THIS COMPLAINT IS BECAUSE I FEEL THIS VEHICLE IS NOT SAFE. I ALSO REALIZED THAT I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE EXPERIENCING THESE SAME PROBLEMS. MY HOPE IS THAT GMC WILL TAKE NOTICE AND CORRECT THIS PROBLEM QUICKLY.",
