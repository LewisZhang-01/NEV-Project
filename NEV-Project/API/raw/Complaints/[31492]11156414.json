A SENSOR IS BEING TRIGGERED REFERRED TO AS A \"CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR\".  WAS TOLD THAT THIS SENSOR NEEDED BE REPLACED AS WELL AS THE WIRING HARNESS THAT GOES TO THE SENSOR.  JEEP IS DOING NOTHING ABOUT THIS SEROUS SAFETY ISSUE AND IS PLACING THE LABOR AND COST OF REPAIR ON ME THE \"CONSUMER\".  THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME HISTORY OF THIS HAPPENING WITH OTHER VARIOUS YEARS OF THIS SAME VEHICLE AND THEY NEED TO DO A RECALL FOR ALL VEHICLES.  MY VEHICLE WAS BEING DIAGNOSED FOR 10 HOURS AND STILL WASN'T REPAIRED BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PARTS TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  THIS ALSO HAPPENS WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IDLE AND RANDOMLY WON'T START ON OCCASION.  THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON NOW FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AND AFFECTS THE RPMS, WHICH BOUNCE FROM AROUND 4,000 TO 2,000 AND THE OVERALL FUEL CONSUMPTION.  I HAVE BEEN GETTING HORRIBLE FUEL MILEAGE BECAUSE OF THIS.  IT ALSO HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE FACTORY INSTALLED AUTO-START, WHICH WON'T WORK BECAUSE OF THESE NON-FUNCTIONING SENSORS.",
