I HAVE EVEN BEEN PULLED OVER BY THE POLICE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CAR DOWNSHIFTS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS CAUSING THE CAR TO IMMEDIATELY SLOW DOWN.  FINALLY MY DEALER HAS AGREED TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION WITH A \"REBUILT\" ONE.  SINCE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE,  I BELIEVE THAT ACURA SHOULD TAKE THIS MUCH MORE SERIOUSLY.",
