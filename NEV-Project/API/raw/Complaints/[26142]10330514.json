        "summary": "AT APPROXIMATELY  8K MILES THE DEALER REPLACED THE ROTORS AND CALIPERS PER THEIR SERVICE BULLETIN WHICH SEEMED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. SINCE THEN, PERIODICALLY WHILE DRIVING, THE BRAKE LIGHT WILL ILLUMINATE WHEN BRAKES ARE APPLIED AND THE ABS SYSTEM ACTIVATES AND THE BRAKES BEGIN TO GROAN, ARE SPONGY, HAVE LESS THAN 10% BRAKING POWER. THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME 5 TIMES OVER 90K MILES. ALTHOUGH I DID NOT MAKE THE CONNECTION AT THE TIME, I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS THE CAUSE OF A REAR END COLLISION THAT I WAS INVOLVED IN  2008 WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO BRAKE THE CAR ON THE FREEWAY BUT FELT THAT THE CAR TOOK MUCH TOO LONG TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP WHEN I QUICKLY SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES.THE VEHICLE CONTINUES THESE SYMPTOMS UNTIL THE IGNITION IS TURNED OFF. WHEN RESTARTED, THE PROBLEM IS RESOLVED. IT HAS MOSTLY ONLY OCCURRED TO ME WHILE DRIVING AWAY FROM A PARKING SPOT BUT YESTERDAY IT OCCURRED WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AT SPEED EXCEEDING 50 MPH. I WAS ONLY ABLE TO STOP THE VEHICLE BY DOWNSHIFTING MY AUTOMATIC TO 1ST GEAR WHILE ATTEMPTING TO ACTIVATE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE. I WAS FORTUNATE THAT I WAS ON A LEVEL FREEWAY AND NOT GOING DOWN A STEEP INCLINE. AFTER I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY PULL OVER, THE IGNITION WAS TURNED OFF AND THE CAR WAS RESTARTED WITH NO BRAKE PROBLEMS. TODAY I TOOK THE CAR INTO THE INFINITI DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT IT WAS A 'COMMON PROBLEM' BUT NOT A RECALL AND THAT THEY WOULD TRY TO REPROGRAM THE COMPUTER. REPROGRAMMING DID NOT WORK AND THEY SAID I WOULD NEED A NEW ABS BOOSTER PUMP AT A COST TO ME OF $925. I LOOKED UP THE PROBLEM ON CONSUMER WEBSITES AND FOUND THAT THE PROBLEM IS FAIRLY COMMON WITH BOTH THE 2004 NISSAN TITAN AND ARMADA AND THE INFINITI QX56. IT SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH THE C1179 CODE. WHAT I DISCOVERED IS THAT ANY CONSUMERS STILL HAD THE PROBLEM EVEN AFTER THEY REPROGRAMMED THE COMPUTER AND REPLACED THE ABS BOOSTER PUMP. A SERVICE BULLETIN REPAIR EXISTS FOR THE 2004 NISSAN TITAN (NHTSA ITEM NUMBER: 10020026). THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN. *TR",
