I UNDERSTAND THAT ALL 4.6 ENGINES IN CROWN VICTORIA'S, MERCURY'S, LINCOLN'S, AND FORD TRUCKS HAD THIS PART ON WHICH MANY FAILED.  FORD MOTOR CO. SO MUCH AS ADMITTED THAT THIS PART WAS UNACCEPTABLE, BECAUSE THE PLASTIC PART WAS REPLACED WITH A METAL ONE.  HOWEVER THEY DECLINE TO DO ANYTHING IF THE CAR IS BEYOND WARRANTY.  I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAD A HIDDEN WARRANTY FOR POLICE CARS AND TAXIS WITH NO MILEAGE RESTRICTIONS.  HELP !!!!!!!     *NLM",
