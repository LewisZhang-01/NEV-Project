        "summary": "ON MAY 25 I WAS TRAVELING ON US 71 APROX. 6 MILES SOUTH ON NEOSHO,MO WHEN I HAD A TIRE BLOWOUT ON MY 2006 28.5' FIFTH WHEEL CAMPER. BY THE TIME I GOT PULLED TO THE SHOULDER THE TIRE TREAD HAD CAME APART AND DONE OVER $1200.00 DAMAGE TO THE SIDE OF THE TRAILER. I PUT SPARE ON AND DROVE TO THE TOWN OF NEOSHO'S WAL-MART AND PURCHASED A NEW GOODYEAR CLASS D TRAILER TIRE AND HAD IT PUT ON GROUND AND THEY DISPOSED OF THE SHREDDED ONE. MY INS. AGENT WHEN LOOKING AT MY CLAIM  SAID THAT HE THOUGHT THE TIRE IN FRONT OF THE NEW TIRE WAS BAD ALSO, SO I TOOK THE CAMPER TO THE TIRE SHOP WHERE HE SAID THAT ALL WERE SEPARATED AND ONE WAS READY TO BLOW. HE SAID HE COULD GET THAT BRAND BUT DIDN'T RECOMMEND THEM AS THEY WASN'T GOOD TIRES BUT CHEAP AND SAID THEIR WASN'T ANY PLACE TO GET THEM WARRANETED SO I BOUGHT 3 MORE GOODYEARS TO MATCH. THESE TIRES CANT HAVE OVER 3000 MILES ON THEM. I KEPT THE TIRES IN CASE THEY NEED TO BE CHECKED. ALSO THE BRAND IS NANKANG SIZE ST225/75R15 DOT # WEHH239440402 (X2) AND THE OTHER ENDS WITH 03 AND OF COURSE THE ONE LEFT AT WAL-MART THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE #'S. I THINK THESE TIRE SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED ON THE ROAD AS LIVES COULD BE LOST WITH THESE CHEAP TIRE. THE MANUFACTURE OF THE 5TH WHEEL IS KZ DURANGO SER#  & IS A 2006 MODEL. IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE IT WOULD BE APPRECIATED. *TR",
