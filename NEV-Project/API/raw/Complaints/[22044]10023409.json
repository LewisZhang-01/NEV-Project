BOTH CORRODED WITH THE SAME PATTERN AND ONLY AT THE ABOVE MENTIONED LOCATION.  INDICATIVE OF MATERIAL INCOMPATIBILITY - FAILURE TO ENGINEER THE PART PROPERLY.  RUSTED PART FAILED COMPLETELY AND WITHOUT WARNING.  COULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT IF THE VEHICLE WAS MOVING FAST AND NEEDED TO BRAKE HARD.  THE GAS TANK HAD TO BE REMOVED TO REPLACE THE FAULTY BRAKE LINES.  THEY WERE, THEREFORE, VERY EXPENSIVE TO REPLACE.   *NLM",
