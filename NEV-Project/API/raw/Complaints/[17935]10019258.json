        "summary": "IN APRIL OF 2002 I PURCHASED A USED 1999 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE FROM A LOCAL DEALER BECAUSE IT HAD ONLY 14000 MILES ON IT.  I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE BRAKE ROTORS AND  PADS DUE TO VIBRATION 2 TIMES.  AT 46000 MILES I PUT NEW TIRES ON THIS TO QUIET A NOISE PROBLEM.  NOW AT 65000 MILES THE NOISE IS EXTREME COMING FROM DRIVE TRAIN.  I WAS TOLD TODAY THERE IS A DEFECT IN THE RING/PINION GEAR ASSEMBLIES USED ON THE 99/00 MODEL YEAR JEEPS. BUT THERE HAS YET TO BE A RECALL REGARDING THIS CONDITION. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE DURABILITY OF THE PRODUCT, AS IT SHOULD HAVE LASTED FAR LONGER THAN 65000 MILES, ESPECIALLY FOR THE AMOUNT PAID FOR IT!  HOPEFULLY CHRYSLER WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR POOR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN QUALITY.  BUT I DOUBT IT. THE ROARING AND HOWLING NOISE IS SO LOUD THAT YOU CAN NOT HEAR OTHERS TALKING AT ROAD SPEED, AND I AM GREATLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE, BUT DUE TO THE GREAT COST OF IT, I CANNOT TRADE IT OR AFFORD TO REPAIR IT BECAUSE I AM ON DISABILITY!!!!!!!!!!   *NLM",
