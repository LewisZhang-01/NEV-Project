CHECK-OIL LIGHT HAD BEEN INTERMITTENTLY ON FOR 2-3 MILES PRIOR, BUT OIL WAS CHECKED AND IT WAS ACTUALLY OVERFULL. 803 MILES PRIOR, VW SERVICE DEPT HAD SERVICED CAR FOR CHECK-ENGINE LIGHT, AND REPLACED TURBO RECIRCULATION VALVE AND HOSE. OIL HAS BEEN CHANGED EVERY 3000 MILES SINCE CAR WAS PURCHASED USED, WITH 30,000 MILES, IN FEB. '04. VW SERVICE DEPARTMENT CLAIMS FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY ENGINE BECOMING OIL-STARVED DUE TO SLUDGE IN OIL TAKE-UP TUBE. SLUDGE CAUSED BY NOT USING SYNTHETIC OIL, ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT REQUIRED. CAM GEAR WAS DAMAGED, LEAVING METAL PIECES THROUGHOUT ENGINE. ENTIRE ENGINE, TURBO AND CATALYTIC CONVERTER HAD TO BE REPLACED.  VW DENIES ANY RESPONSIBILITY. PARTS MAY STILL BE W/MECHANIC, I CERTAINLY DO NOT HAVE FACILITIES OR DESIRE TO STORE AN ENTIRE RUINED ENGINE. *NM",
