I HAVE DOCUMENTATION EVIDENCING THE DATE OF THE SERVICE, WHICH WAS AFTER THE RECALL WAS IN EFFECT.  I CAN PROVIDE THE DOCUMENTATION UPON REQUEST.  IN MAY 2016, I SPECIFICALLY ASKED THE HONDA SERVICE CENTER ABOUT WHETHER MY CAR WAS SUBJECT TO THIS RECALL, SINCE MY HUSBAND'S ACURA MDX HAD THIS RECALL.  THE SERVICE CENTER SAID NO, BUT THAT THEY HAD THE PARTS SINCE THE ACURA RECALL WAS IN EFFECT.  TWO MONTHS LATER I RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF THE RECALL, WHICH WAS IN EFFECT A FEW DAYS BEFORE I WENT TO HONDA IN MAY 2016.  I IMMEDIATELY CALLED HONDA TO REQUEST A SERVICE APPOINTMENT FOR THE RECALL AND TO OBTAIN A LOANER CAR.  THE HONDA PILOT IS MY FAMILY'S MAIN FORM OF TRANSPORTATION AND WE NEED ALL OF THE SEATS TO BE OPERATIONAL.  I WAS TOLD BY HONDA THAT SOMEONE WOULD GET BACK TO ME WITHIN TWO WEEKS REGARDING THE LOANER, AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE TO ORDER THE REPLACEMENT PART FOR THE RECALL UNTIL FALL 2016.  I WAS FURTHER TOLD THAT I SHOULD CALL IN FALL 2016 TO ORDER THE REPLACEMENT PART.  IT HAS BEEN OVER THREE WEEKS SINCE I FIRST CALLED HONDA TO REQUEST THE LOANER CAR.  I HAVE MADE FOLLOW UP CALLS TO HONDA WITH NO RESPONSE.  I FEEL UNSAFE IN MY CAR, AND YET HONDA HAS BEEN UNRESPONSIVE TO THIS SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN.",
