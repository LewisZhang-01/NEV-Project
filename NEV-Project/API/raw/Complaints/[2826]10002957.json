SHOP OWNER TOLD ME OF 4 OTHER NEONS HE HAS HAD TO SERVICE FOR THE SAME BLOWN HEAD GASKET AND THAT NEON OWNERS ARE LUCKY IF THEIR CAR HITS 40,000 MILES WITHOUT THIS PROBLEM. I KNOW 2 OTHER PEOPLE WITH NEONS AND THEY HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM ALSO. I WAS TOLD THIS WOULD COST ME 550.00 TO FIX. IT IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING FIXED RIGHT NOW, BUT I FEEL A RECALL NEEDS TO BE DONE TO SOLVE THIS.",
