I DID ALL THE MAINTENANCE THAT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE DONE WHEN THEY WERE DUE. AFTER ALL THE CARE I TOOK, MY CAR'S TRANSMISSION WENT OUT ON DEC. 31, 2002 WITH ONLY 66,000 MILES ON THE CAR. THEY SAID IT WOULD BE $2200 TO REPLACE A TRANSMISSION. I FEEL THE CAR SHOULD HAVE LASTED LONGER THAN 66,000 MILES. SHOULD THERE BE A RECALL ON THESE CARS? I ALSO FEEL THE MANUFACTURE SHOULD BE LIABLE.",
