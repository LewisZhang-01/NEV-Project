MY WIFE WITH A FULLY LOADED CAR WITH KIDS ON BOARD WAS THANKFULLY ABLE TO SLOWLY MUSCLE THE CAR ON TO THE SHOULDER. SHE THEN POWERED THE CAR OFF AND THEN RESTARTED IT WHICH SEEMED TO FIX THE PROBLEM. LUCKILY THIS INCIDENT DID NOT HAPPEN ON CURVY ROAD OR THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MAJOR ACCIDENT.    FORD, PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM. WOULD HATE TO SEE SOMEONE GET HURT AND THE EXPLORER NAME DAMAGED ALL OVER AGAIN DUE TO ANOTHER VERY SERIOUS ISSUE.  *TR",
