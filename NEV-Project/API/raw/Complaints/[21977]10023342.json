ABOUT 50% OF THE TIME WHEN THE ANTI-LOCK BREAKS ENGAGE, THE BREAK PEDDLE GOES ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND THE VEHICLE WILL CONTINUE TO ROLL.  WE HAVE HAD THIS OCCUR SEVERAL TIMES.  WE HAVE HAD TO AVOID OTHER VEHICLES TO PREVENT AN ACCIDENT AS WELL AS HAVE ROLLED THROUGH A FEW RED LIGHTS.  EACH TIME THE DEALER DOES NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE.  THE REPLACED AND ADJUSTED THE REAR BREAKS ONCE WHICH DID SEEM TO HELP HAVING THE ANTI LOCK BREAKS ENGAGE SO EASILY.  TODAY IT HAPPENED AGAIN AND WE HAD TO SWERVE ONTO THE CURB TO AVOID REAR ENDING A VEHICLE WHICH RESULTED IN A BROKEN RIM ON THE VEHICLE.   *NLM",
