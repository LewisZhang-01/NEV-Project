WHEN DRIVING ESPECIALLY ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN I APPLY MY BRAKES THE SHAKING AND PULSATION MAKES ME THINK I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STOP. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET I FIND THAT MANY SEDONA OWNERS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS. I TOOK IT IN TO MY LOCAL KIA DEALER TODAY(7/28/2009) AND THEY TOLD ME THAT YES MANY HAVE THIS PROBLEM BUT IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS COVERED WITH MY WARRANTY. I HAVE TO HAVE THEM REPLACED OR TURNED AT A COST TO ME OF SOME $400. WHY WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS ISSUE WHY HAS NO ONE ISSUED A RECALL TO FIND OUT WHY THIS IS HAPPENING. I AM JUST AS FRUSTRATED AS THE OTHER OWNERS TRYING TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. I GUESS IT IS GOING TO TAKE A FEW PEOPLE GETTING HURT OR KILLED BEFORE THIS ISSUE CAN BE RESOLVED. *TR",
