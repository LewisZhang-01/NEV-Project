        "summary": "MY DAUGHTER WAS PLACING ITEMS IN THE BACK OF OUR 2005 TOYOTA SIENNA XLE WHEN THE POWER REAR LIFTGATE SUDDENLY CAME DOWN WITH GREAT FORCE AND STRUCK HER ON THE ARM/SHOULDER.  IT WAS WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY THAT MY DAUGHTER WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM UNDER THE DOOR.  THE LIFTGATE OPERATED ON ITS OWN.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY RISK.  MY DAUGHTER WAS ABLE TO FORCE HER WAY FREE, WITH BRUISES, BUT A SMALLER PERSON COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED.  I WILL TALK TO TOYOTA CUSTOMER CARE TO REPORT THIS INCIDENT, BUT IN MY OPINION THIS IS A DANGEROUS VEHICLE. I CHECKED THE LIFTGATE WHEN I ARRIVED HOME AND IT IS STILL OPERATING ERRATICALLY.  UNTIL THIS IS RESOLVED, WE HAVE TURNED OFF THE POWER TO THE REAR LIFTGATE AND ARE OPERATING IT MANUALLY.    *JB",
