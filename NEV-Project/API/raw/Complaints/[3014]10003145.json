NOW THE CAR HAS BEEN AT THE SHOP FOR TWO WEEKS AND DODGE STATES THE PARTS ARE NOT IN PRODUCTION AND UNAVAILABLE UNTIL A LATER UNKNOWN DATE. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE PART IS BEING REMANUFACTURED TO ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM, BUT THE NEW PART HASN'T BEEN PRODUCED YET. THERE IS NOT A DATE SET FOR WHEN THE PART WILL BE AVAILABLE. DODGE OBVIOUSLY KNEW THE PART WAS DEFECTIVE OR THEY WOULD NOT HAVE IMPROVED IT FOR REPLACEMENT. WHY WAS MY SAFETY PUT AT RISK FOR A PART THEY KNEW WAS A PROBLEM?",
