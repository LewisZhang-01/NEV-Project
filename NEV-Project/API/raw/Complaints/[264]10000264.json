I TOOK MY CAR TO MY MECHANIC TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH MY HEATER THEY TOLD ME BEFORE THEY DID ANYTHING TO CONTACT FORD BECAUSE THERE WAS A RECALL ON MY CAR FOR THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM.  I CONTACTED FORD AND THEY FIRST TOLD MY THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL.  AFTER I PRESENTED THEM WITH THE RECALL NUMBERS THEY THEN INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS A SUCH RECALL, BUT THAT MY CAR WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER THE RECALL.  ON YOUR WEB-SITE THERE IS A SECTION ON THE RECALL ON THE SAME YEAR MAKE AND MODEL AS MY CAR.  IT NOTES THAT 342,962 MERCURY COUGARS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN REFUSE TO PROVIDE MY WITH THE RECALL ALSO.",
