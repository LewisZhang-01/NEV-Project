I STOPPED THE CAR, PLACED IT IN PARK, TURNED OFF THE ENGINE & YELLED AT MY CHILDREN TO JUMP OUT OF THE CAR. A GENTLEMAN, DRIVING BEHIND ME STOPPED, LOOKED AT THE CAR & CALLED 911. HE THEN PROCEEDED TO START THE CAR BACK UP & DRIVE IT TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  AFTER THE POLICE CAME, CHECKED THE ROAD & FILLED OUT THE REPORT, I THEN TURNED THE CAR AROUND & DROVE IT BACK TO MY GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE & PARKED IT.  THE NEXT DAY, I DROVE IT TO MY AUNT'S HOUSE & PARKED IT IN HER DRIVEWAY UNTIL MONDAY WHEN IT WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP ( WHERE IT IS STILL LOCATED ) THERE WAS NO CAR IN FRONT OF ME WHEN THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED, & THERE IS NO DAMAGE TO THE BODY OF THE CAR.   *NLM",
