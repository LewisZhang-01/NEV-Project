        "summary": "I HAVE OWED THE VEHICLE FOR 53 DAYS AND HAVE TO HAVE IT TOWED 4 TIMES AND REPLACE FUEL PUMP TWICE, THE BATTERY ONCE. LUCKILY THE PUMP CONKED OUT WHILE PARKED, AND NOT AT AN INTERSECTION. MY WIFE IS PREGNANT WITH OUR THIRD CHILD, AND THE VAN HAS STRANDED HER 4 TIMES. I HAD THE DEALERSHIP RUN A CHECK ON THE PAST REPAIR HISTORY OF THE VAN AND HEY! THE PUMP WAS REPLACED  (BY THE PREVIOUS OWNER) ON 7/6/01 AND AGAIN ON 8/04/01. WITH THE ADDITION OF MY TWO PUMPS, THAT BRINGS THE TOTAL TO 4, OBVIOUSLY. THE VAN HAS 38000 MILES AND FOUR FUEL PUMPS, I THINK THAT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. I HAVE WRITTEN A LETTER TO CHEVROLET, OF COURSE DON'T EXPECT A FAVORABLE RESPONSE. ANOTHER FACTOR OF COMPLETE IRRITATION IS THE PLACEMENT OF THE BATTERY. IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR AN AVERAGE JOE LIKE MYSELF TO ACCESS THE BATTERY TO REPLACE IT. I HAD TO PAY $200 FOR PARTS AND LABOR FOR A BATTERY, WHICH I COULD REPLACE MYSELF IF THE THING WASN'T DESIGNED (SEEMINGLY) TO PREVENT OWNER MAINTENANCE. I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND THIS VEHICLE TO ANYONE. WHEN IT RUNS IT'S NICE, BUT UNLESS YOU WANT TO RUN THE RISK OF HAVING IT TOWED ONCE EVERY 13 DAYS AND PAYING $520 IN REPAIRS AND TOWS WHILE ONLY OWING THE CAR FOR LESS THAN TWO MONTHS, PURCHASE SOMETHING ELSE.
