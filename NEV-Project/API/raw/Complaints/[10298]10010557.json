DURING ONE SNOW STORM WE DROVE DIRECTLY TO THE DEALER, THEY CHANGED THE WIPER BUT WITHIN 10 MINUTES THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED. WE WERE TOLD THE FIRST TIME TO USE ONLY SATURN WIPERS, BUT THEY DON'T MAKE A \"WINTER\" WIPER?? THE SECOND TIME THE TECH. TOLD US TO TRY AND FIND SOME AFTER MARKET WINTER WIPERS. AFTER RUNNING AROUND FOR 3 DAYS TO \"AUTO PARTS\" STORES ALL OVER THE CITY WE FINALLY FOUND A PAIR THAT WOULD FIT. IT HAS HELPED...BUT SATURN HAS NOT!!!     *NLM",
