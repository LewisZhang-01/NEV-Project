I PULL OVER THE SHOULDER AND WAITED AND STARTED THE VEHICLE I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE AFTER SOME TIME. THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE FOR ALL THE JETTAS VOLKSWAGEN KNOWS ABOUT THIS AND THEY EXTENDED THE WARRANTY FOR SOMETIME. THIS PROBLEM WITH TRANSMISSION VALVE BODY HAPPENS AFTER CERTAIN MILES. I AM OUT OF THIS COVERAGE AND THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND I WOULD REQUEST THAT THERE SHOULD BE A SAFETY RECALL SO THAT THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN WITH ANY ONE ELSE. PLEASE TAKE ACTION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  *TR",
