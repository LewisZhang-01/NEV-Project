(I LIVE IN MN, AND HAVE NOTICED THIS PROBLEM IS WORSE WHEN THE TEMP IS BELOW ZERO.)     I HAVE HAD 2 MINOR ACCIDENTS ALREADY BECAUSE OUT OF THE BLUE MY VEHICLE TAKES OFF AS THOUGH IT IS GOING 70 MILES AN HOUR. THE BRAKES DO NOT SEEM TO WORK WHEN THIS IS OCCURRING.    IN ORDER TO STOP THIS FROM OCCURRING, I NEED TO QUICKLY SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL, WHICH CAUSES THE ENGINE TO REV UP TO 4500 RPM. I HAVE TRIED RESTARTING THE ENGINE MULTIPLE TIMES, AND KICKING DOWN THE GAS PEDAL, AND EACH TIME THE RPM REMAINS HIGH.    WHEN I AM TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, AND THIS BEGINS TO OCCUR, THE ENGINE REVS TO 3000 RPM, AND DRIVES ITSELF AT 65-70 MPH (ACTS ALMOST AS IF THE CRUISE IS SET).    I HAVE BEEN STRANDED TWICE NOW, AND HAVE FOUND THAT ONCE THE VEHICLE SITS FOR 10 MINUTES OR SO, IT SEEMS TO BE OK.",
