WHILE GOING 30MPH WITH THE 3RD GEAR, IF YOU ACCELERATE SO THAT THE SECOND GEAR KICKS IN, IN KICKS IN VERY SHARPLY, CREATING AN UNBEARING JERK THAT IS VERY OBSTRUSIVE INSIDE THE CABIN.  HONDA SHOULD PLACE A RECALL ON THIS MODEL.  DEALER WAS WILLING TO REPLACE IT BUT I'M NOT SURE IF NEW TRANSMISSION WILL BE BETTER THAN THE OLD ONE.",
