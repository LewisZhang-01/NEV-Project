THE PASSENGER DOOR BEGAN TO OPEN ABOUT 3 MOS. AGO WITH THE SOUND LIKE THAT OF A COKE CAN BEING FOLDED MIDWAY ON THE CYLINDER,  THEN BEING FOLDED BACK & FORTH.  UPON INSPECTION,  I NOTED A SMALL CRACK ON THE SHEET METAL THAT THE HINGE IS BOLTED TO.  TODAY THE CRACK EXTENDS ABOVE & BELOW THE TOP & BOTTOM OF THE HINGE APPROX 1/2 INCH.  THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR STARTED MAKING THE \"COKE-CAN\" SOUND ROUGHLY A WEEK AGO;  AND HAS A CRACK SLIGHTLY LONGER THAN THE HINGE IS HIGH.  AFTER READING REPORTS OF PEOPLE HAVING THEIR HINGES DISCONNECT FROM THEIR CARAVANS DUE TO WHAT I REGARD AS AN APPARENT FATIGUE FAILURE,  I AM CONCERNED.",
