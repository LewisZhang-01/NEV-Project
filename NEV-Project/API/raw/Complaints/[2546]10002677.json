        "summary": "SPARK PLUGS!!  I HAVE A 98 LINCOLN NAVIGATOR, I JUST HAD A 60,000 MILE SERVICE COMPLETED ON IT 3,000 MILES AGO.  THE TRUCK WAS SPUTTERING AND STALLING OUT IN TRAFFIC, THE LINCOLN DEALERSHIP ASSURED ME IT WAS A HOSE EGR/PCV, I CAN'T REALLY RECALL WHICH.  THEY REPLACED THE HOSE ALONG WITH THE SERVICE.  I DEPLOY TO KOREA IN SEP 02', AND I GET A CALL FROM MY WIFE THE TRUCK IS DOING THE SAME THING.  SO SHE TAKES IT TO A DIFFERENT LINCOLN DEALERSHIP, THEY INFORM HER THAT A SPARK PLUG IS RUSTED AND FROZEN IN THE HEAD ASSY.  THEY ALSO INFORM HER THAT THE UPPER HALF IS BROKEN OFF, AND THE LOWER HALF IS STILL IN THE HEAD.  I CALL TO ASK IS THIS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT ON ONE THE REGULAR SERVICES, AND HE SAID \"MAYBE\".  THAT IS ALL HE WOULD SAY , HE SAID HE COULD NOT COMMENT ON WHAT ANOTHER DEALERSHIP SHOULD HAVE DONE.  SO I'M GETTING NOWHERE, BUT OUT OF $14-$1,500.  MY COMPLAINT IS THAT HOW IS SOMETHING LIKE THIS SUPPOSE TO CAUGHT IF NO ONE EVER CHECKS UNDER THE SPARK PLUG COVERS EVEN FOR CONDITION AND SECURITY.  I HAD THIS TRUCK CHECKED BEFORE I LEFT SO I WOULD FEEL GOOD THAT MY WIFE AND KIDS WRE IN A RELIABL/SAFE VEHICLE, WHEN IN FACT THAT TRUCK COULD OF STALLED OUT WHEN SHE WAS PASSING OR EVEN CAUGHT ON FIRE OR SOMETHING.  THAT IS MY COMPLAINT.",
