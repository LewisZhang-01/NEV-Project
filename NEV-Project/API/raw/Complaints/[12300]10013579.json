        "summary": "MY COMPLAINT IS THE NEW FRONT WHEEL BEARING HUBS. THESE UNITS ARE USED ON MY 1999 CHEVY TRUCK. THE BEARING HUB ASSEMBLY IS A PRELUBED UNIT. I WAS ON THE HIGH-WAY RUNNING AT ABOUT 70 MPH. I STARTED TO HEAR A HI PITCH NOISE FROM THE FRONT END OF MY TRUCK. I STOPPED TO CHECK THIS OUT. I RETURNED HOME VERY SLOW. MY INVESTIGATION TURNED UP,THAT THE WHEEL BEARING WAS BAD. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE G.M. REDESIGN THIS UNIT SO THAT IT CAN BE LUBED. I ALSO FEEL THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. THERE WAS NO WARNING. I ALSO FEEL THAT MAYBE THE TYPE OF LUBE USED SHOULD ALSO BE CHANGED. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING CHEVY CARS OR TRUCKS FOR THE PASS THIRTY YEARS. I MUST STRESS THAT THE ITEM IN QUESTION IS ON THE FRONT END, IF A PERSON WERE TO LOSE CONTROL ,THAT PERSON WILL HARM OTHERS.  *JB",
