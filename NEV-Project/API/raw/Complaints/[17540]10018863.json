BOTH TIMES THE WINDOWS WERE FIXED, HOWEVER, THEY WERE RELUCTANT TO FIX THE PROBLEM AS IF IT HAD BEEN MY FAULT. I HAVE A SMALL CHILD AND I DON'T THINK HE APPRECIATES ASPHYXIATION FROM SO MUCH WIND IN HIS FACE ON THE LONG DRIVES TO THE DEALER TO BE REPLACED.  THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE PROBLEMS ON THIS CAR, THE CLUTCH GETS STUCK (REPAIRED TWICE), THE SUNROOF TRIM BROKE OFF AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, THE ENGINE MAKES A RATTLING NOISE WHEN SHIFTING (FIXED TWICE), STEREO SYSTEM SWALLOWED MY CD (TWICE BEFORE NEW SYSTEM INSTALLED), AND AIR CONDITIONING RELEASES AN AWFUL MOLDY SMELL WHEN TURNED ON WHICH DEALER REFUSES TO ATTEMPT TO FIX.  BOUGHT CAR IN VALENCIA VOLKSWAGEN IN VALENCIA, CA.  SOLUTION SIMPLE, TRADED IN MY 1YR OLD CAR FOR A BETTER CAR, ONE THAT WORKS!  *JB",
