        "summary": "MY WIFE WAS INVOLVED IN A FATAL ACCIDENT ON JULY 2, 2006.  SHE WAS A PROMISING MICRO-BIOLOGIST WHOM WORKED ON CURES FOR OVARIAN CANCER. SHE WAS RAN OFF A ROAD BY ANOTHER DRIVER AND SENT INTO A LINE OF TREES IN OUR BUICK RENDEZVOUS (2002 CX).  THE DRIVER-SIDE HEADLIGHT MADE DIRECT CONTACT WITH ONE TREE AND THE FORCE OPENED THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR ALLOWING IT TO BE \"RIPPED\"  OFF THE HINGES.  THEREBY, EXPOSING HER TO THE NATURAL ELEMENTS AND MAKING HER VULNERABLE TO STRIKE A SECOND TREE THAT BROKE EVERY BONE IN HER FACE AND KILLED HER.  I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE WHEN THE 2002 RENDEZVOUS WAS TESTED, IT RECEIVED 3 TO 4 STARS AND THE CONSISTENT PROBLEM THAT AROSE, BASED UPON THE ARTICLE THAT I READ, THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR OPENS DURING AN OFFSET FRONTAL ACCIDENT. WE WERE NEVER SENT ANY INFORMATION WHERE BUICK WAS LOOKING INTO THIS DEFECT AND IT ONLY HAD A RECALL ON THE REAR HATCH THAT WE HAD TO HAVE FIXED IN 2003.   IF THIS PROBLEM WOULD HAVE POSSIBLY BEEN CORRECTED OR AT LEAST ADDRESSED, I SINCERELY BELIEVE THE OUTCOME OF THE ACCIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE FOR ME.    *NM",
