DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS CONFIRMING THIS.  I CALLED DODGE AND THEY DENY HAVING ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROBLEM.  WHEN I TOLD THEM ABOUT THE COMPLAINTS ON THIS AND OTHER SITES HE AGAIN DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF IT.  I WAS TOLD THAT IT'S MY PROBLEM NOT THEIRS.  AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE THERE IS NO WAY I WILL EVER BUY A CHRYSLER PRODUCT AGAIN AND I DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD.*AK",
