HAD I NOT OPENED IT UP AND REMOVED THE VALVE COVER ALONG WITH THE COIL PACK ITSELF, THE CAR WOULD HAVE WENT UP IN FLAMES. I FEEL SORRY FOR THOSE WHO DONT KNOW MUCH ABOUT CARS. THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH VW COIL PACKS. VW CLAIMS THAT IF THEY GO BAD YOU CAN STILL DRIVE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP. I DONT BELIEVE THIS TO BE A SAFE IDEA.",
