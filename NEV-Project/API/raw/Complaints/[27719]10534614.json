        "summary": "I OWN A 2001 MERCEDES-BENZ CLK430.  I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING INTERMITTENT SPORADIC FAILURE OF THE ABS, BAS, ESP SYSTEMS WHEN I APPLY THE BRAKE. ON OCCASIONS THE GAS PEDAL STICKS AND THE CAR SPEEDS UP TO DANGEROUS SPEED.  THE CAR HAS TO BE PUT IN NEUTRAL AND ONCE STOP AND RESTART, IT WOULD RUN NORMAL AGAIN, AND THE CAR SHOWS \"NO MALFUNCTION\".    RECENTLY ON JULY OF 2013, WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AND THE CAR SPED UP ON IT OWN AND ALMOST WENT OUT OF CONTROL.  WHEN I APPLY THE BRAKE ABS/BAS/ESP REPORTED AS FAILED, BUT THE CAR DID STOP WHEN I PUT IN NEUTRAL AND APPLY THE BRAKE.  I TOOK TO MERCEDES-BENZ AND THEY SAID THEY DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEM. I TOLD THEM I WANT THEM TO RUN THE \"COMPUTER DIAGNOSIS\" AND I WANT THEM TO GIVE ME THE REPORT. BELOW ARE A FEW OF THE SAFETY SYSTEM FAILURES THAT ARE ON THE REPORT:    ETC - ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION CONTROL  CODE 120 THE FRONT RIGHT WHEEL SPEED OF THE TRACTION SYSTEM IS SPORADICALLY IMPLAUSIBLE  CODE 121 THE FRONT LEFT WHEEL SPEED OF THE TRACTION SYSTEM IS SPORADICALLY IMPLAUSIBLE    ME2-SFI - MOTOR ELECTRONICS 2.8  CODE P20DD-001 B37 (ACCELERATOR PEDAL SENSOR) :  SIGNAL 1 / SHORT CIRCUIT TO POSSITIVE / POTENTIONMETER ABOVE MAXIMUM VALUE (P0123)    ESP - ELECTRONIC STABILITY PROGRAM  CODE C1504-009 THE SYSTEM IS SWITCHED OFF.  CODE C1100-001 L6/1 (LEFT FRONT SPEED SENSOR)  CODE C1101-001 L6/2 (RIGHT FRONT SPEED SENSOR)    EZS - ELECTRONIC IGNITION SWITCH  CODE B1156-005 THE CONTROL UNIT HAS SHORT CIRCUIT TO GROUND OR OPEN CIRCUIT.    TELE AID [USA] - TELEMATIC SYSTEM  CODE N1100 NO SIGNAL IS RECEIVED FROM THE RIGHT-SIDE SPEED SENSORS.  CODE N1101 NO SIGNAL IS RECEIVED FROM THE LEFT-SIDE SPEED SENSORS.    I SEARCHED ON GOOGLE AND FOUND MANY OWNERS REPORTED PROBLEMS WITH THEIR ABS/BAS/ESP SYSTEMS WITH CLK430 ON WWW.MBWORLD.ORG    I BELIEVE THESE ARE MANUFACTURING DEFECTS AND MERCEDES SHOULD RECALL THE CLK430 AND FIX THE ISSUES.  *TR",
