I SEE THAT THE 2004 MODEL HAS A RECALL, AND MINE WAS MANUFACTURED IN LATE 2004, BUT IS NOT ON THE RECALL VIN LIST. I DID NOT REALIZE THAT THIS MAY MEAN THE AIRBAG IS NOT FUNCTIONING AT ALL, BUT RATHER THOUGHT IT WAS JUST AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM. THE 2005 MODEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS RECALL. THIS LOOKS LIKE A LONG STANDING PROBLEM WITH PREVIOUS YEARS MODELS AND OBVIOUSLY HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED IN THE 2005 MODEL.",
