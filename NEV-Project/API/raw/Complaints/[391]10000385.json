IT IS VERY , VERY DANGEROUS,  AND I INFORMED THE CLOSEST DEALER TO MY LOCATION, BAY RIDGE KIA WHEN  I BROUGHT THE CAR IN FOR CORRECTION OF RECALL ITEMS, BUT THE BELT WAS NOT ON THE LIST.  I AM INFORMING DOT IN THE HOPE OF PREVENTING ANYONE FROM BEING INJURED BY THIS DEFECT.  I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER AND AT MY EXPENSE IMMEDIATELY ORDERED A NEW LATCH SECTION  OF THE BELT, PART NO. 0K2AB-57-680-96. OF COURSE I ASKED, IF  THAT PART  HAD BEEN MODIFIED? THE ANSWER WAS, NO SURPRISE, YES.   I ALSO HAD SENT  A LETTER TO KIA SERVICE HEADQUARTERS IN SAN DIEGO , CALIFORNIA . DO NOT HESITATE TO RECALL THIS ITEM, AS THE BELT SEEMS LOCKED, BUT IT ISN'T.*EA04007*",
