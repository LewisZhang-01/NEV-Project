THE MECHANIC NOTICED A GAPING, RUSTED HOLE IN THE SUBFRAME AND WAS VERY CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY IN DRIVING THE VEHICLE ANY FURTHER. HE INDICATED THAT THIS AMOUNT OF DETERIORATION AND RUST WOULD TAKE WELL OVER A YEAR TO OCCUR. I'VE ONLY OWNED THE VEHICLE FOR 9 MONTHS AND MY LIMITED WARRANTY WAS ONLY GOOD FOR 6 MONTHS. IT WAS ALSO NOTED THAT THE CONTROL ARMS WERE BRAND NEW AS THEY STILL HAD THE TAGS ATTACHED. THESE WERE INSTALLED PRIOR TO MY PURCHASE OF THE VEHICLE. I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY WERE VERY UNWILLING TO HELP. I'VE FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AS WELL AS CONTACTED AN ATTORNEY TO ASSIST ME IN HAVING THE DEALERSHIP REPAIR MY VEHICLE AS IT WAS SOLD IN AN UNSAFE CONDITION AND NOT FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE.  *TR",
