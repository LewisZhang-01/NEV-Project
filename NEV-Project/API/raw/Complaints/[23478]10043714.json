THE VEHICLE SHUTS OFF WHILE YOU ARE DRIVING.*AK  THIS WEEK ALONE I WAS ALMOST HIT THREE TIMES. I WAS ON MY WAY TO WORK  TODAY AND WAS TURNING ONTO THE FREEWAY AND WAS ALMOST SLAMMED INTO. I  HAVE BEEN CALLING TELLING THEM THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE.    THE CAR HAS BEEN TAKEN IN MANY TIMES THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW THINGS DONE  OR THERE WAS NOTHING FOUND. EVERY SINGLE TIME WE GET THE CAR BACK EITHER  IMMEDIATELY OR SOON THEREAFTER THE VEHICLE STARTS TO STALL WHILE  DRIVING.    WE SPOKE WITH THE CORPORATE OFFICE THEY TOOK DOWN THE INFORMATION HAD US  BRING THE CAR IN AND THEN KEPT IT FOR A SIX DAYS. WHEN WE GOT THE CAR  BACK WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THE CAR BEGAN TO SHUT OFF AGAIN.    WE ARE IN A LEASE AGREEMENT AND AT THE END OF THE YEAR 2004 WE CAN TRY  TRADE IT IN. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT A CAR THAT IS GOING TO  CAUSE MY DEATH IS HORRIBLE.    I CALLED IN TO SHOWCASE HONDA AND SPOKE TO JAIME WHO ONLY WANTED US TO  BRING THE CAR BACK. THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THAT IS IT WILL BE SENT BACK  AGAIN WITH THE SAME LIFE THREATENING ISSUES. I AM AT MY WITS END. I  DON'T KNOW WHERE I CAN GET HELP ON THIS MATTER.    DAWNN L. HUMPHREY",
