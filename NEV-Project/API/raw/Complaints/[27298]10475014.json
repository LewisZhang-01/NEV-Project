UPON INVESTIGATION IN THE DODGE FORUMS, THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS HAPPENING ON A REGULAR BASIS DUE TO THE HEATER HOSES BEING DIRECTLY ABOVE THE EXHAUST COLLECTOR AND IS CAUSING THE RUBBER TO FAIL AND THUS CAUSING COOLANT LEAKS.  BEST CASE IS IT SMELLS WHEN THE COOLANT IS LEAKING ON THE EXHAUST, WORST CASE IS PEOPLE ARE GETTING STRANDED DUE TO OVERHEATING.  DODGE CLAIMS THIS IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  *TR",
