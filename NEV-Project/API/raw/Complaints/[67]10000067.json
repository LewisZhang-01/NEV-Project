I HAD THE BIKE SOLD TO ANOTHER BUYER AND HE RAN A CAR FAX ON THE VIN # . THE INFORMATION SHOWS A 10000 MILE MISREAD ON THE BIKE. I RESEARCHED THE BIKE AND ALSO FOUND OUT IT WAS PROFESSIONALLY RACED ALL YEAR IN 1999 WITHOUT ANY GAGES ON IT. THE DEALER WHICH I PURCHASED THE BIKE FROM TOLD  ME AND ALSO SIGNED AN ACCUALL ODOMETER DISCLOSER THAT THE BIKE HAS 2000 MILES ON IT I HAVE CONTACTED THE DEALER ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND I AM GETTING THE RUN AROUND. I PURCHASED THE BIKE IN GOOD FAITH THAT ALL THE IFORMATION ON THE CONTRACT WAS CORRECT, I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT IT IS NOT. I WOULD HAVE NEVER PURCHASED A RACE BIKE BECAUSE OF THE WEAR AND TEAR ON THEM. PLEASE HELP.  GLEN BUTLER",
