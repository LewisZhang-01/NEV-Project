        "summary": "THE HEATER CONNECTOR ON THE FUEL FILTER HOUSING HAS DEVELOPED A SIGNIFICANT FUEL LEAK. THIS ISSUE CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO STOP RUNNING AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT IN HEAVY TRAFFIC. I HAD TO CALL FOR A TOW. THE TOW TRUCK GUY HOPPED INTO THE VEHICLE AND TURNED THE KEY TO PUT IN NEUTRAL SO THAT HE COULD LOAD THE VEHICLE. HE LEFT THE KEY ON AND WITHIN A MINUTE SMOKE WAS ROLLING OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD. I THOUGHT THE THING WAS GOING TO CATCH ON FIRE. I HAD NO FIRE EXTINGUISHER (WHY WOULD YOU NEED ONE FOR A NEW VEHICLE?). I JUMPED IN THE VEHICLE, TURNED OFF THE KEY, POPPED THE HOOD, AND PULLED THE HEATER PLUG OFF (WHICH WAS WHERE ALL THE SMOKE WAS COMING FROM). OBVIOUSLY, FUEL LEAKING ON ELECTRICAL CONNECTORS (ESPECIALLY AN ELECTRICAL FUEL HEATER COMPONENT), DOESN'T MAKE FOR A SAFE MIX. THIS ISSUE HAS ALREADY BEEN REPORTED TO THE NHTSA AND HAS ALSO BEEN REPORTED ON VARIOUS JEEP FORUMS. THIS ISSUE IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY THE MANUFACTURER.  *JB",
