        "summary": "VEHICLE IS SLOW WHEN SHIFTING IN LOW GEARS; PULLING AWAY FROM STOP LIGHTS/SIGNS FEELS AS IF THE CAR IS NOT IN DRIVE AND GOING TO STALL. THIS COULD RESULT IN BEING REAR ENDED SINCE SO MANY DRIVERS SPEED AWAY WHEN LIGHT TURNS GREEN. IT SEEMS LIKE IT STUTTERS DURING SHIFTING. HAVING IT IN ECO-MODE HIGHLIGHTS THE ISSUE FURTHER. THE DOWN SHIFTING AT HIGHER SPEEDS FEELS LIKE A STICK SHIFT CAR, NOT NORMAL OR COMFORTABLE. EVEN ON THE HIGHWAY ACCELERATION IS OFTEN NOT VERY RESPONSIVE DURING ENTRANCE AND PASSING. THE GAS PEDAL IS VERY TOUCHY, NO WAY TO PULL AWAY SLOWLY, JUST TAKES OFF; THIS MIGHT BE PART OF THE ISSUE, CONFUSING THE SENSORS DURING SHIFTING. I CONTACTED MY SALES PERSON WHO SAID HE'D HAVE A SERVICE TECH CONTACT ME, NO CALLS YET. I WISH I HAD CHECKED THIS SITE AND EDMUNDS BEFORE BUYING, AS I WOULD HAVE CHOSE A DIFFERENT MANUFACTURER. THIS IS MY 4TH JEEP GR CHEROKEE, UNFORTUNATELY THE LEAST DESIRABLE, MY '09 HAD ZERO ISSUES AND ORIGINAL BRAKES AT TRADE IN WITH OVER 105,000 MILES; '14 IS LIKELY MY LAST.   *TR",
