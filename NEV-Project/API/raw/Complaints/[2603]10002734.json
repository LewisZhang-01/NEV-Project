IF THE INCLINCE IS STEEP ENOUGH, I ACTUALLY HAVE TO PUT MY LEFT FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND INCREASE THE ENGINE SPEED TO AROUND 900 RPM TO PREVENT THE CAR FROM ROLLING BACKWARDS WHEN MY FOOT IS TAKEN OFF THE BRAKE. THE DEALER TELLS ME THEY HAVE RECEIVED A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS, BUT THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS DESIGNED.",
