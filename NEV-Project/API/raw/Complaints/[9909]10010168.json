        "summary": "1.) ROUGH IDLE, AND OIL LIGHT INTERMITTENTLY COMES ON WHEN IDLING AND ONLY GOES OFF WHEN ACCELERATING, BUT OFTEN STALLS OUT, AND DOESN'T WANT TO RE-START.  (HAD OIL CHANGED TWICE TO GET EXCESS GAS OUT OF IT FROM TRYING TO START IT.)  HAD TO TOW CAR THREE TIMES.  PAID $1,000 TO TRY TO GET IT FIXED, BUT ON THE WAY HOME IT DID THE SAME THING.    2.)  COOLING FAN QUIT WORKING AND CAR OVERHEATED AND I PAID TO HAVE THE RADIATOR REPLACED, AS PETCOCK WAS LEAKING.  MECHANIC DIDN'T NOTICE THAT FAN WASN'T WORKING, SO IT OVERHEATED ON THE WAY HOME WITH A NEW RADIATOR.  I FIGURED THAT OUT.  ONCE THE FAN WAS REPLACED WITH A WORKING FAN, NO MORE OVERHEATING.    AFTER-MARKET RADIATOR WAS BIGGER THAN THE ORIGINAL, CAUSING THE AT FLUID LINE TO GET SAWED OFF BY THE PULLEY 3 TIMES, BEFORE SOMEONE JUST PLUGGED THE LINE AND INSTALLED A SEPARATE AT FLUID \"MINI RADIATOR TYPE\" COOLER.    3.)  TRANSMISSION DRAGS; CAR HAS JUST OVER 70,000 MILES ON IT. HAS REPEATABLE PROBLEM WHEN STARTING OUT AND SHIFTING FROM FIRST TO SECOND GEAR, USUALLY JERKING FORWARD WHEN IT SHIFTS.  PUTTING CAR INTO DRIVE AFTER STARTING IT USUALLY ENDS UP IN THE CAR STALLING, AND THE IDLE IS DIFFERENT WHEN IT'S IN GEAR THAN WHEN IN PARK OR NEUTRAL.  4.)  I RECEIVED A NOTICE ABOUT A CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT REGARDING A DEFECTIVE TFI MODULE, BUT EVERY MECHANIC I SPOKE WITH SAID THAT WASN'T THE PROBLEM, BUT THE NOTICE SAID THAT A BAD TFI MODULE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY ALWAYS MAKE THE CAR STALL WHEN IT'S GOING BAD, JUST SOMETIMES. STALLED IN RUSH HOUR ONCE.   5.)  THE DRIVER SIDE AUTOMATIC SEATBELT QUIT WORKING, WHICH CAUSED THE PLASTIC GUIDE FOR THE BELT TO BREAK, AND WHEN I WENT TO FORD TO TRY TO GET THE PART, THEY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE IT WAS, AND SAID THAT THEY WEREN'T PLANNING TO HAVE THE PARTS AVAILABLE AFTER 2002 ANYWAY.  OFTEN, I ABOUT GOT STRANGLED, AS DID OTHERS WHO RODE IN MY TEMPO, WHEN WE OPENED THE DOOR TO GET OUT OF THE CAR.      6.)FROM THE CAR OVERHEATING, THE FINISH ON THE HOOD IS PEELING AND CRACKING.    *NLM",
