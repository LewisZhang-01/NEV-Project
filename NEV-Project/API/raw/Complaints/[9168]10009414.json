        "summary": "1ST TIME SEAT BROKE WAS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. 2ND WAS ON ME, MILEAGE OVER 60000. THE BRACKET THAT HOLDS THE SEAT IS LIKE 4 THIN WASHERS, 1ST TIME 2 BRAKE, DEALER REPLACED. LESS THAN 6 MONTHS LATER, THEY ALL BROKE. I HAD TO WIRE THE SEAT IN PLACE TO STOP FROM COMING COMPLETELY OFF. CAN'T USE THE 6 WAY POWER AT ALL, FOR FEAR OF SOMETHING ELSE COMING OFF OR BRAKING. I WOULD GUESS THAT THERE OTHER FULL SIZE VANS OUT THERE THAT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. THE DEALER MIGHT SAY ITS ON THE CONVERSION COMPANY, BUT IT WASN'T IN MY CASE. THANK YOU.   *TS    *NLM    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12-12-02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**770174",
