THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED, I WAS ON THE INTERSTATE GOING TO WORK. THE CAR STUTTERED, ACTING LIKE IT WASN'T GETTING ANY GAS AND WANTED TO STALL. I WAS AFRAID I WAS GOING TO GET HIT FROM BEHIND. THE CAR WOULD ONLY GO ABOUT 30-40 MILES AN HOUR. WILSON FORD SAID THEY REPLACED A MAP SENSOR. I DROVE THE CAR FOR ABOUT A WEEK. THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED . WILSON'S  TOLD ME THE SENSOR WAS BAD. THE SAME PROBLEM AGAIN. THEY THEN SAID THEY HAD TO RESET THE COMPUTER AND FIX A FRACTURED WIRE. MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING THE CAR LAST THURSDAY. MY GRANDSON WAS A PASSENGER. THIS PROBLEM AGAIN OCCURRED. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. I HAVE COMPLAINED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND ALSO FORD COMPANY WITHOUT ANY SATISFACTION. THIS PROBLEM OCCURS WHEN THE CAR IS IN MOTION. I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE NHTSA ON SEPT 28 VIA TELEPHONE. I SPOKE WITH AMY AROUND 7PM. I GAVE HER ALL MY INFO. WE WERE CUT OFF BY HER LINE. I'M NOT SURE ALL INFO WAS RECORDED. I HAVE ALSO CONTACTED THE WV STATE ATTORNEYS OFFICE. MY CAR IS STILL AT WILSON FORD. I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THEM.",
