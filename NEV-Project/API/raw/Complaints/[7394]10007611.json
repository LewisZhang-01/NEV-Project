THIS NOTICE WAS FOR VEHICLES WITH 70,000 MILES OR LESS (FREE REPAIR). OUR VEHICLE HAS 75,000+ MILES AND YESTERDAY OUR AIR BAG LIGHT IS STAYING ON... I DO NOT THINK THAT IT IS RESPONSIBILE FOR DIAMLER CHRYSLER TO SET MILAGE LIMITS FOR REPAIRS. WE HAVE A LARGE FAMILY AND US OUR VAN ALOT... DIAMLER CHRYSLER SHOULD NOT BE ALOUD TO SET MILAGE LIMITS. BECAUSE OF THIS DECISION, I WILL NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER DIAMLER CHRYSLER PRODUCT.    THANK YOU.",
