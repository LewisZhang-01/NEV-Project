NISSAN ISSUED LETTER IN 2013  STATING THAT DUE TO A MANUFACTURING IRREGULARITY THE ESCL MAY MALFUNCTION. THEIR SOLUTION WAS TO EXTEND WARRANTY TO 6 YEARS / UNLIMITED MILES. MY CAR HAS APPROX 61,000 MILES, BUT PAST THEIR TIME LIMIT. NISSAN DENIED ANY RESPONSIBILITY AND DEALER CHARGED  $678.14 FOR THE PART WHICH IS READILY AVAILABLE FOR UNDER $400. TOTAL COST FOR REPAIR WAS $991.37, PLUS MY TOWING CHARGE OF $37. DEALER SERVICE DEPT HAD QUOTED A PRICE OF HIGH $800 TO $900. WHY WAS VEHICLE NOT RECALLED AND REPAIRED WHEN NISSAN KNEW THAT THE PART COULD FAIL WITHOUT ANY WARNING? I WAS FORTUNATE THAT VEHICLE WAS NOT DISABLED IN A MORE DANGEROUS AREA. WE HAD TWO VISITS FROM AAA BEFORE WE DISCOVERED THE LIKELY PROBLEM THROUGH THE INTERNET.",
