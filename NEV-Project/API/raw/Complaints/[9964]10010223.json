COMBUSTION GASES WERE IN THE COOLING SYSTEM, AS WAS OIL RESIDUE.  OIL ALSO FOUND IN THE TOP PART OF THE ENGINE IN THE INTAKE MANIFOLD.  IT IS SUSPECTED THAT COOLANT AND MAYBE WATER HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE CYLINDERS.  DON'T KNOW YET WHAT DAMAGE IS DONE INTERNALLY TO THE ENGINE.  LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP INDICATED THAT IT WAS A $2000 CHARGE TO REPAIR.  ENGINE NOT UNDER THE WARRANTY PROGRAM ISSUED BY FORD FOR THE 1995 WINDSTARS EVEN THOUGH IT'S THE SAME 3.8L ENGINE.  FORD CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE LOGGED MY CALL BUT SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT TREATING THIS ISSUE AS A WARRANTY ITEM AND THAT I WAS ON MY OWN TO FIX IT.  *JB",
