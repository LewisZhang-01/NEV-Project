        "summary": "MY 2001 DODGE DURANGO HAS HAD A POPPING NOISE ON THE FRONT END FOR SOME TIME. I RECENTLY HAD TIME TO DISASSEMBLE THE FRONT END AND FOUND THAT MY UPPER BALL JOINTS WERE EXCESSIVELY WORN. I RESEARCHED THE INTERNET TO SEE IF DODGE HAD A RECALL. I ALSO E-MAILED DODGE AND THEY RESPONDED THAT IT IS UNDER INVESTIGATION. UPPER BALL JOINTS, IF ENGINEERED CORRECTLY, SHOULD LAST OVER 100,000 MILES. THE POPPING NOISE HAS BEEN ACTIVE SINCE ~ 50,000 MILES AND I CURRENTLY HAVE 89,000 MILES. I CALLED A LOCAL DODGE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND THEY QUOTED ME $390.00 TO REPAIR ONE UPPER BALL JOINT, WHICH WILL REQUIRE AN ALIGNMENT AS WELL. UPPER BALL JOINTS COST ~ $45.00 AT ANY PARTS DEALER AND ALIGNMENTS ~ $60.00. I DO NOT THINK THAT DODGE SHOULD CHARGE CONSUMERS FOR THEIR FAULTY ENGINEERING. A RECALL SHOULD BE IN EFFECT, BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT OR KILLED CAUSED BY A FAULTY ENGINEERED BALL JOINT.*AK",
