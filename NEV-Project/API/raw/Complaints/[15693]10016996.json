STARTED NOTICING PROBLEMS SHORTLY THEREAFTER, DECIDED TO REPORT IT AFTER THE MOST CURRENT INCIDENT AND UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS AT FIXING).  - WHEN TRYING TO START THE CAR, IT WILL START THEN DIE IMMEDIATELY, I HAVE ALMOST BEEN STRANDED A FEW TIMES. I HAD TO KEEP TRYING TO RESTART THE CAR UNTIL THE ENGINE FINALLY STAYED RUNNING (THIS HAS OCCURRED AT LEAST 7 TIMES FROM MARCH 1, 2003 AND IS GETTING PROGRESSIVELY WORSE). COULD THIS POTENTIALLY CAUSE THE ENGINE TO DIE WHILE DRIVING?   - THE SEAT BELT WARNING BUZZER HAS NEVER FUNCTIONED DURING MY OWNERSHIP.   - THE DOOR BUZZER HAS NEVER FUNCTIONED DURING MY OWNERSHIP, NOT IF THE LIGHTS ARE LEFT ON OR IF THE KEYS ARE STILL IN THE IGNITION. *JB",
