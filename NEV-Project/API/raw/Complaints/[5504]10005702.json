A DETERIORATION IN PERFORMANCE WAS NOTED, ALONG WITH A SMELL OF GASOLINE FROM BEHIND THE VEHICLE AS IF IT WERE RUNNING RICH.  THE VEHICLE ALSO BACKFIRES ON DECELLERATION.  WHILE MY VEHICLE CONTINUES TO BE USABLE, OTHER OWNERS HAVE REPORTED A NEED FOR COMPLETE ENGINE REBUILDING TO FIX CAM TIMING INACCURACIES, SCUFFED CYLINDER BORES FROM INCORRECTLY SEATING RINGS (CAUSING OIL BURNING AND CARBON FOULING OF THE COMBUSTION CHAMGER).   SOME OWNERS HAVE REPORTED THE LOSS OF USE OF THE VEHICLE DUE TO SPARK PLUG FAILURE.  I HAVE WRITTEN LETTERS TO THE MANUFACTURER WHO RESPONDED BY PHONE AND DETERMINED THAT MY VEHICLE IS \"NORMAL\".  THIS, WITHOUT VIEWING THE VEHICLE OR HAVING IT LOOKED AT BY AN AUTHORIZED DEALER.  I FEEL IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE VEHICLE FAILS TO OPERATE WHICH I BELIEVE POSES A DANGER TO MY SAFETY IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN IN HIGH SPEED TRAFFIC.",
