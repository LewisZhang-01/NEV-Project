        "summary": "THE HEADLIGHTS ON OUR 1996 CARAVAN ARE THE TYPE WITH A CLEAR PLASTIC OR GLASS COVER OVER THE BULBS.  OVER TIME, THE CLEAR COVERING HAS BECOME VERY CLOUDY TO THE POINT THAT THE HEADLIGHTS DO NOT ILLUMINATE WELL ENOUGH TO SAFELY SEE AT NIGHT.  THE LIGHTS ARE NOT DAMAGED, THE LENSES ARE JUST NOT AT ALL CLEAR ANYMORE.   I THOUGHT THE PROBLEM MIGHT BE THE HEADLIGHT ADJUSTMENT BUT OUR LOCAL DODGE DEALER TELLS US THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE CLOUDY LENS.  THEY SAY THE ONLY REPAIR OPTION IS TO REPLACE THE LIGHT ASSEMBLIES.  OUR VEHICLE WARRANTY IS LONG SINCE EXPIRED BUT I DO NOT SEE THIS ISSUE AS ONE OF WARRANTY BUT RATHER SAFETY.  ANY REASONABLE PERSON SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPECT THE HEADLIGHTS ON A VEHICLE TO ILLUMINATE A SAFE PATH AS LONG AS THE VEHICLE IS CONTINUED IN SERVICE.  I'VE CONTACTED CHRYSLER CORPORATION AND THEY SAY IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND DISAGREE WITH MY SAFETY COMPLAINT.*AK",
