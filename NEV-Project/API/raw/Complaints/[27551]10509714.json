THE FIRST OCCURRENCE WAS SEVERAL YEARS AGO ON THE PASSENGER SIDE, AFTER WHICH, THE VISOR WOULD NOT STAY UP AND WOULD FALL IN THE VISION OF THE PASSENGER.  JUST THIS MONTH, HOWEVER, THE SAME THING HAPPENED ON THE DRIVERS SIDE.  THIS IS VERY HAZARDOUS, ESPECIALLY IF IT WERE TO HAPPEN WHILE TRAVELING ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY. THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE WITH THE ASSEMBLY OF THE VISORS, WHICH CRACK AT THE ELBOW WHICH IS USED TO MOVE THE VISOR AROUND AS NEEDED. AFTER THIS HAPPENS THE VISOR THEN WILL NOT STAY UP WHEN RETURNED TO THE ORIGINAL POSITION.  *TR",
