ABOUT 3 YEARS AGO THE FUEL PUMP WAS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY BY HUBLER CHEVROLET ON US31 IN GREENWOOD. I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS WAS THE SAME PROBLEM THEN. THE BILL SAYS THEY REPLACED THE PUMP AT THAT TIME. THIS TIME THE TRUCK WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY SO I WAS GOING TO REPLACE THE FUEL PUMP MYSELF. WHEN I PULLED THE PUMP FROM THE TANK I FOUND THE BURNT WIRES.   I BENCH TESTED THE PUMP AND IT STILL WORKED. ALSO THE WIRES FOR FUEL GAUGE WERE MELTED. THE FUEL GAUGE HAD BEEN WORKING OFF AND ON FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS. I WAS WAITING FOR WARMER WEATHER TO PULL THE FUEL TANK AND FIX IT WHEN THIS HAPPENED. AS HOT AS IT HAD TO GET TO MELT THE WAY IT DID, MY FAMILY AND I ARE FORTUNATE THAT THE FUEL TANK DID NOT EXPLODE.   *JB",
