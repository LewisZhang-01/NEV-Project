        "summary": "100 MILES WEST OF PHOENIX AND TRAVELING AT 65 MPH, I SUDDENLY LOST ALL STEERING ASSIST. IF I HAD BEEN ON A CURVE, I WOULD HAVE GONE OFF THE ROAD OR INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC. 29,000 LBS OF MOTORHOME CAN BE HANDLED WITHOUT POWER STEERING IF YOU HAVE PLENTY OF MUSCLE AND ARE READY FOR IT. I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THE RADIATOR COOLING FANS WERE INOPERATIVE.  COACH NET HAD ME TOWED TO A SHOP IN PHOENIX WHERE IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE HYDRAULIC PUMP SPLINES THAT ENGAGE THE POWER TAKE-OFF WERE DISINTEGRATED. I CALLED GILLIG AND THEY SAID THAT A FEW OF THEIR CHASSIS HAD BEEN THE VICTIM OF A COMPLACENT EMPLOYEE WHO FAILED TO APPLY SPLINE GREASE AT THE TIME OF ASSEMBLY. THEY WERE NICE ENOUGH TO SEND A NEW POWER TAKE-OFF AND HYDRAULIC PUMP AT NO CHARGE [ABOUT $500 WORTH]. IT COST ME ABOUT $500 LABOR. IT WORRIES ME ABOUT HOW MANY MORE VEHICLES WITH GILLIG CHASSIS THAT HAVE THE SAME SITUATION ARE OUT THERE WITH THE POTENTIAL OF SUDDENLY BECOMING AN OUT OF CONTROL ROLLING MISSILE. MINE IS A 1997 MODEL AND HAD 32,000 MILES ON IT WHEN IT HAPPENED. YOU GILLIG CHASSIS OWNERS OUT THERE MIGHT WANT HAVE THIS CHECKED OUT. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME AT: PASHIR@THEGATEWAY.NET                        PAUL LANGTON                        '97 CC INTRIGUE",
