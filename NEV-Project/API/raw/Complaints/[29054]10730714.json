WHEN YOU ARE AT A STOP OR MAKING A LOW SPEED TURN THE GAS PEDAL DOESN'T ENGAGE IN ORDER FOR THE CAR TO MOVE.  THIS COULD BE DANGEROUS IN THAT YOU MAY BE IN HARMS WAY WITH NO WAY OF GETTING OUT OF THE SITUATION.  I DID TAKE MY VEHICLE INTO THE DEALER AFTER I FIRST EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM BUT THEY HAVE NO RECALLS OR FIXES FOR THE PROBLEM.   UPDATED 09/09/15*LJ.....UPDATED 09/11/15 *BF  THE CONSUMER STATED WITHIN THE LAST FEW DAYS, THE VEHICLE STALLED AGAIN AT A STOP LIGHT.
