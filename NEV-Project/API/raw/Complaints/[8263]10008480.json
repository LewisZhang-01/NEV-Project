SO I WENT OUT TO THE XTERRA AND IT WOULD NOT START. I HAD TO CALL A CAB TO GO GET HIM.  WE NOTIFIED OUR DEALERSHIP, THEY SAID MOST LIKELY THE FUEL PUMP SENDING UNIT GONE BAD. THAT THEY HAVE SIX XTERRA'S IN THEIR LOT THAT HAVE BEEN THERE FOR 2 WEEKS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  PARTS ARE ON NATIONAL BACK ORDER, AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA AS TO WHEN PARTS CAN BE EXPECTED.  WE NOW HAVE TO HAVE OUR VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALER, AT OUR EXPENSE BECAUSE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY WE PAID $1,200 FOR JUST RAN OUT 2 WKS AGO !!!  THEY DO NOT KNOW WHEN THEY CAN HAVE THE VEHICLE FIXED BECAUSE PARTS ARE ON BACK ORDER.    THIS PROBLEM IS A SAFETY RELATED ISSUE AND SHOULD DEFINITELY BE RECALLED.*JB",
