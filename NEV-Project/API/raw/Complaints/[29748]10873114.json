        "summary": "THE REAR AXLE ON OUR 2003 FORD WINDSTAR CRACKED WHILE MY DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING IT. THANK GOODNESS IT DID NOT RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT AND SHE WAS ABLE TO PULL INTO A NEARBY LOT. WE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE NEW AND IT HAS BEEN RUSTING FROM THE INSIDE OUT AND NOW THE AXLE. WE DID HAVE THE RECALL \"BRACKETS\" PLACED ON THE VEHICLE, HOWEVER, IT APPEARS THEY DID NOT WORK! FORD NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OF THIS ISSUE WITH ITS CUSTOMERS AND NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND A VEHICLE PURCHASE IS A DIFFICULT EXPENSE FOR MOST INDIVIDUALS. NOT ONLY DO MOST OF US EXPECT THE VEHICLE TO LAST, BUT WE DO NOT EXPECT TO BE IN DANGER BECAUSE OF NEGLIGENCE AND COST-CUTTING MEASURES THAT SAVE THEM MONEY, WHILE SCREWING THE CONSUMER FINANCIALLY. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE AND I CAN ONLY HOPE FOR THE SAKE OF ALL THE CONSUMERS THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS NEGLIGENCE, THERE IS SERIOUS CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO THE LITIGATION OF THIS ISSUE ON BEHALF OF HARD-WORKING PEOPLE.",
