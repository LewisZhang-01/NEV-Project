THE VEHICLE ACCELERATED SUDDENLY TWO MORE TIMES BEFORE THE CONTACT WAS ABLE TO TAKE VEHICLE  TO THE DEALERSHIP. IT OCCURRED WHILE AT A COMPLETE STOP. AGAIN THE BRAKES WOULD NOT HOLD AND THE VEHICLE WAS PLACED INTO NEUTRAL TO GET IT TO STOP. THE VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY AT THE DEALER FOR DIAGNOSTIC TESTING, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETED AT THIS TIME. *AK  UPDATED 12/27/2005 - WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS STARTED COLD IT WOULD NOT STAY ON AND IDLED ERRATICALLY.  THE DEALER INFORMED THE CONSUMER THAT THE ACCELERATION PROBLEM AND IDLE PROBLEM WERE DUE TO A FAULTY THROTTLE SENSOR.  THE DEALER REPLACED THE THROTTLE VALVE ASSEMBLY BUT THAT DID NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM.*NM",
