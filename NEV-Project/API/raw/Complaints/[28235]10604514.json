        "summary": "WHILE STOPPED AT A RED TRAFFIC LIGHT, I PRESSED THE PHONE HANGUP BUTTON (BLUETOOTH CONNECTION) ON THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE ENGINE IMMEDIATELY SHUT OFF. I PUT THE CAR IN PARK, FOOT ON THE BRAKE, PRESSED THE START BUTTON ON THE DASH - ENGINE DID NOT START.  TRY #4 IT STARTED. MEANWHILE THE TRAFFIC LIGHT HAD GONE THROUGH A FULL CYCLE, THEN RED AND LATE ON THE 2ND GREEN I WAS ABLE TO MOVE THE CAR.  CONSIDERABLE HONKING FROM CARS BEHIND ME DURING THE EVENT, BUT FORTUNATELY NO ACCIDENTS OR INJURIES DURING THIS STALL.  ON JUNE 17, 2014 I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO KEYES LEXUS MAINTENANCE IN VAN NUYS, CA, MY DEALERSHIP AND THE MAINTENANCE SERVICE I ALWAYS USE.  THEY COULD NOT FIND ANY DEFECTS IN THE SHOP OR DURING A LONGRANGE DRIVE, BUT THE DRIVER DID NOT USE THE BLUETOOTH. LEXUS SAID NO SYSTEMIC DEFECTS HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE BLUETOOTH, OR OTHER PROBLEMS WITH ENGINE STALLS, AND MY GOOGLE SEARCH CONFIRMED THAT.    I TURNED THE LEASED VEHICLE IN AT KEYES LEXUS, AND THEY MADE AN EXCELLENT DEAL FOR ME TO LEASE A NEW 2015 RX450H.    I AM NOT COMPLAINING ABOUT ANY OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WORKED WITH ME, AND I AM A LONG TIME CUSTOMER AT KEYES LEXUS WHICH PROVIDES OUTSTANDING SERVICE AND COURTESY. HOWEVER, I AM UNCONVINCED THAT THE VEHICLE IS SAFE.  *TR",
