THE LATCH MECHANISM ITSELF CAN BE PUSHED CLOSED WITH YOUR FINGER WHEN THE DOOR IS OPEN HOWEVER IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY STAY CLOSED. A SPRING FORCES IT BACK OPEN.    THE LATCH FAILED IN THE PARKING LOT. WHEN I GOT IN TO COME HOME FROM WORK, THE DOOR WOULD NOT LATCH CLOSED. I THOUGHT MAYBE THE SEAT BELT OR SOME OTHER OBJECT GOT CAUGHT IN IT HOWEVER THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. IN ORDER TO DRIVE HOME, I HAD TO HOLD THE DOOR CLOSED AS BEST AS I COULD WITH ONE HAND WHILE ATTEMPTING TO STEER AND OPERATE TURN SIGNALS WHICH IS EXTRAORDINARILY UNSAFE AND DISTRACTING.",
