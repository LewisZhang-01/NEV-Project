YOU CAN TURN THE IGNITION OFF AND BACK ON AND SOMETIMES THE BRAKE LIGHT GOES OFF AND EVERYTHING IS FINE AND SOMETIMES IT IS NOT.  THERE SEEMS TO BE NO RHYME OR REASON. SOME DAYS IT NEVER COMES ON AND SOME DAYS IT NEVER GOES OFF. AFTER RESEARCHING ONLINE IT APPEARS THAT IT IS AN ISSUE WITH THE COMPUTER MODULE AND A SOFTWARE UPDATE IS NEEDED.  PLEASE FIX THIS. THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED IT WAS VERY SCARY! I WAS DRIVING WITH MY 3 KIDS AND THOUGHT THAT MY BRAKES HAD WENT OUT COMPLETELY. IT WAS MONTHS BEFORE IT HAPPENED AGAIN BUT NOW IT SEEMS TO BE AN EVERY DAY OCCURENCE.",
