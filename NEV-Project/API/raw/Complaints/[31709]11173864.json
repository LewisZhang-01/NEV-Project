        "summary": "I HAVE A TOYOTA RAV4 2008 WITH A 4 CYLINDER ENGINE. TOYOTA HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS ENGINE HAS AN OIL CONSUMPTION PROBLEM AND HAD A WARRANTY RECALL. I NEVER RECEIVED ANY NOTICE. I ALWAYS HAVE THE OIL CHANGED FROM THE DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT THE CAR. THEY NEVER MENTIONED THIS RECALL UNTIL IT HAD EXPIRED BY SIX WEEKS. I NOTICED THAT IT WAS LOSING OIL SO I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND TOLD THEM ABOUT IT. THEY INSPECTED THE CAR AND TOLD ME THEIR WAS NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF OIL LEAKING OUT AND THEN TOLD ME ABOUT ABOUT THE RECALL. THEY SAID I COULD SPEND 2500.00 DOLLARS TO GET IT REPAIRED. MY QUESTION IS IF TOYOTA MANUFACTURED A DEFECTIVE ENGINE THAT LOSES OIL (MOST LIKELY BURNING IT) THEN WHY IS THIS A TIMED EVENT? IF I HAVE THIS VEHICLE WITH THIS ENGINE THEN THEY SHOULD CORRECT THE RECALLED ISSUE AT NO CHARGE TO ME LIKE EVERYONE ELSE THAT HAD THIS SAFETY ISSUE. THE DEALER KNEW I OWNED THIS CAR THAT WAS HAVING THIS ISSUE AND NEVER MENTIONED IT. WHO IS GOING TO REPAIR THIS RECALLED PROBLEM? THANKS.",
