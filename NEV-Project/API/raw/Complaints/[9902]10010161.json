THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT ON THE CAR, THEY PUT AN NEW TRANSMISSION IN. NOW FOR THE SECOND TIME \"MARCH 2003\" THE TRANSMISSION IS ACTING UP AGAIN, AFTER SHIFTING INTO SECOND GEAR IT WILL NOT GO INTO THIRD GEAR CAUSING THE CAR TO JERK AND REDLINE.  SINCE I HAVE BROUGHT MY CAR I HAVE COME INTO CONTACT WITH ALOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS OUT OF THIS CAR. IF MAZDA KNOWS THAT THESE CARS ARE HAVING THESE KINDS OF PROBLEM WHY ARE THEY STILL SELLING THEM. I'M AFRAID TO PUT MY DAUGHTER IN THIS CAR BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. AND I AM GETTING NO HELP FROM THE PLACE WHERE I BROUGHT THE CAR EXCEPT WE'LL PUT A NEW ONE IN. WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS? WHEN SOMEONE GETS HURT AR KILLED? PEOPLE PLEASE DO RESEARCH ON ALL THE CARS THAT YOU PURCHASE.   *NLM",
