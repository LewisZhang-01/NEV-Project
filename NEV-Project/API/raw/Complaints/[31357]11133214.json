FROM WHAT I'VE READ AND UNDERSTAND THIS IS A ONGOING ISSUE WITH THE ABS MODULES ON THESE BIKES. INSTEAD OF ISSUING A RECALL HARLEY HAS OPTED TO REPLACE BRAKE FLUID AT NO CHARGE AND RECOMMEND CHANGING FLUID EVERY TWO YEARS AFTER. THIS SEEMS TO BE A ENGINEERING PROBLEM AND NOT A FLUID PROBLEM. THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER VEHICLES WITH ABS AND DOT 4 FLUID THAT ARE NOT HAVING THIS ISSUE. I HAD ROAD THE BIKE TWO WEEKS BEFORE AND HAD NO PROBLEMS. IT SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS VERY QUICKLY WITH NO WARNING. THIS COULD BE DEADLY ON THE ROAD!",
