        "summary": "THIS IS THE 3RD TIME THE BRAKES HAVE FAILED SINCE I PURCHASED THE USED 2004 ARMADA ABOUT 1.5YRS AGO.  THE ARMADA WHEN PURCHASED HAD APPROXIMATELY 123,000 MILES ON IT.  NOT LONG AFTER I PURCHASED WHILE DRIVING AT 50MPH THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT SOFT THE BRAKES WERE AT APPROXIMATELY 5% AND THERE WAS AN ELECTRICAL GRINDING NOISE.  AFTER TURNING THE VEHICLE OFF AND ON AGAIN THE PROBLEM WENT AWAY. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO NISSAN AND WAS TOLD THAT THE ROTORS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE THEY WERE SO THIN THE BRAKE PADS WERE HAVING TROUBLE GRIPPING THEM AND THAT WAS CONFUSING THE ABS WHICH IS WHAT I WAS HEARING.  I WAS ALSO TOLD THE BRAKE SOFTWARE NEEDED TO BE UPDATED AT ADDITIONAL COST.  I PAID FOR EVERYTHING TO BE DONE ONLY TO HAVE THE PROBLEM AGAIN A COUPLE MONTHS LATER WHILE DRIVING SLOWLY ON A GRAVEL SURFACE. I CONTACTED THE DEALER AGAIN AND WAS TOLD JUST TO TURN THE VEHICLE ON AND OFF AGAIN AND IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN TO BRING IT IN.  WHILE DRIVING THROUGH A SHOPPING CENTER PARKING LOT IT HAPPENED AGAIN. BRAKES GO OUT, PEDDLE GOES SOFT AND ELECTRICAL NOISE.  I TOOK THE ARMADA TO THE DEALER AGAIN AND WAS TOLD THIS TIME THE BRAKE FLUID NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  I ASKED WHY WASN'T THAT DONE WHEN ALL THE OTHER WORK WAS PERFORMED ONLY A FEW THOUSAND MILES EARLIER.  THEY SAID IT WAS NOT PART OF THE WORK TO REPLACE THE BRAKES.  I PAID TO HAVE THE BRAKE FLUID REPLACED. RECALLS HAVE BEEN DONE ON 2004 ARMADAS FOR BRAKE ISSUES IN THE PAST, DURING MY LAST VISIT TO NISSAN I WAS TOLD THE MODULE THAT CONTROLS ALL THE BRAKING SYSTEM IN MY VEHICLE COULD BE BAD WHICH MAY NEED TO BE REPLACED.  I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL MY BRAKES FAIL AGAIN BEFORE THEY SUPPOSEDLY WILL KNOW.  NISSAN KNOWS THERE ARE PROBLEMS STILL WITH THE 2004 ARMADA BRAKING SYSTEM AND SHOULD BE MADE TO RECALL THEM ALL TO FIX THEM.  *TR",
