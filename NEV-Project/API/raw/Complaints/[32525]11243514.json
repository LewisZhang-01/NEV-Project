WHEN I ACCELERATE THE VEHICLE THE ENGINE OCCASIONALLY STOPS ACCELERATING AND GOES INTO A FAILURE MODE WHERE I CANNOT ACCELERATE. A FEW WARNINGS SHOW UP ON THE DASHBOARD RELATED TO HILL START ASSIST AND BEING DISABLED AND TO SERVICE ADVANCE TRACK. TURNING THE CAR OFF AND BACK ON RESOLVES THE PROBLEM, BUT THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AS I'M USUALLY ACCELERATING TO GET ONTO A HIGHWAY WHERE IT'S NOT SAFE TO HAVE MY VEHICLE STOP. FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF THE RECALL MY VEHICLE SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN 16B32 (MANUFACTURED BETWEEN 8/31/15 TO 4/27/16 IN KANSAS CITY), BUT FORD TELLS ME MY VIN IS NOT LISTED AS AFFECTED. THIS PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED TWICE NOW AND IT IS UNPREDICTABLE IN WHEN IT WILL OCCUR. A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH OF \"HILL START ASSIST FAILURE\" SHOWS A LARGE NUMBER OF OTHER FORD OWNERS WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM.",
