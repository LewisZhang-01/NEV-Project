THE NOISE GETS QUIETER WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED, BUT RETURNS AS SOON AS YOU LET UP ON THE BRAKES.  I'VE HAD THE NOISE CHECKED OUT AND WAS TOLD THAT THE BRAKE VACUUM BOOSTER WAS LEAKING.  THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING TO A 2001 FORD ESCAPE WITH LESS THAN 51,000 MILES ON IT.      THE INTERESTING THING IS, MY MOTHER HAS A 2001 MAZDA TRIBUTE, AND SHE JUST HAD THIS EXACT PROBLEM WITH HER CAR.  HER MILEAGE, TOO, IS AROUND 50,000.  WE FIND IT ODD THAT THE VEHICLES ARE MADE BY THE SAME MANUFACTURER AND BOTH HAVE RELATIVELY LOW MILEAGE FOR THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM.     HAVE OTHER DRIVERS HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THESE VEHICLES?",
