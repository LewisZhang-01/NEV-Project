        "summary": "THIS VEHICLE GAVE ME PROBLEMS FROM THE BEGINNING. TO BEGIN, IT BEGAN BREAKING ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD GOING ABOUT 45-50 MPH. THIS CONTINUED TO HAPPEN AND MY TOYOTA DEALER TOLD ME THAT I WAS A LIAR. I CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE CAR, UNKNOWING WHEN IT WOULD STOP ME IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC AGAIN. IT THEN HAD ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE DASHBOARD AND RADIO WOULD GO BLACK WHILE I WAS DRIVING; MY AIR CONDITIONER WOULD STOP AS WELL. ALSO, I WAS DRIVING ON AN INTERSTATE ALONE WITH MY CRUISE CONTROL ON AND IT KEPT BREAKING ME AND TELLING ME THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER CAR IN FRONT OF ME. THIS CONTINUED FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES OF CONSTANT DRIVING (PICTURE BELOW). THE LAST THING THAT HAPPENED TO ME IN THIS CAR WAS THAT THE LANE ASSIST WOULD PULL ME OUT OF MY LANE AND INTO ANOTHER WHEN TRYING TO CORRECT BETWEEN LINES. THIS HAPPENED A FEW TIMES AND TOYOTA WOULD DO NOTHING ABOUT IT. MY MOTHER WAS DRIVING MY CAR ONE DAY ABOUT 75 MPH ON AN INTERSTATE AND IT PULLED HER OFF THE ROAD TO THE LEFT. THIS CAR GAVE ME NOTHING BUT TROUBLE SINCE PURCHASING IT BRAND NEW. MY CAR STARTED THIS TROUBLE WITHIN 5 MONTHS OF ME OWNING THE VEHICLE AND TOYOTA PROVIDED NO ASSISTANCE. I WAS VERY UPSET AND DISAPPOINTED THAT I CHOSE THIS CAR ABOVE OTHERS. I HOPE TOYOTA WILL DO THEIR JOB AND FIX THESE PROBLEMS SO ANOTHER CAMRY DRIVER MAY NOT EXPERIENCE WHAT I, UNFORTUNATELY, HAD TO.",
