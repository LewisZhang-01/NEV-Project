ALONG WITH THE POPPING, THERE IS A VIBRATION IN THE STEERING WHEEL DURING THE TURN TO THE LEFT.  THE VIBRATION HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN PRESENT SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS BOUGHT AT 100 MILES.  THE POPPING BEGAN SOON AFTER. THE VIBRATION WAS REPORTED TO THE DEALER BEFORE 36,000 MILE AND I WAS TOLD IT WAS NOTHING TO BE CONCERNED WITH.  AFTER THE 36,000 MILE WARRANTY, THE POPPING BEGAN TO OCCUR MORE FREQUENTLY AND WITH GREATER VOLUME AND THE VIBRATION CONTINUED. THE 96/98 CAVALIERS ARE RECALLED FOR STEERING CONCERNS THAT SOUND SIMILAR TO THE PROBLEMS MY 2000 IS HAVING, YET I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY SPECIFIC VEHICLE DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR THE RECALL.   *NLM",
