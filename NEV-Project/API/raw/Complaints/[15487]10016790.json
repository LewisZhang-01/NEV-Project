        "summary": "I HAVE A JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE LIMITED YEAR 2003.  IT HAS THE GEN-3 SEAT BELTS IN THE BACK SEAT.  THESE SEAT BELTS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO RELEASE IN CRASHES.  I TESTED THE SEAT BELT OUT AND IT RELEASES WITH A SIMPLE TOUCH OF THE ELBOW.  I CONTACTED  DAIMLER CHRYSLER AND EXPLAINED THAT THE SAFEST PLACE FOR CHILDREN IS IN THE BACK SEAT BUT IT IS USELESS IF THE SEAT BELTS RELEASE UPON IMPACT.  MY 6 MONTH IS SAFER IN THE FRONT SEAT WITH SEAT BELTS THAT WORK PROPERLY.  DAIMLER CHRYSLER EXPLAINED TO ME THAT IF THE SEAT BELTS ARE USED PROPERLY THEY ARE SAFE.  ISN'T THERE ONLY 1 WAY TO USE A SEAT BELT?  I EXPLAINED TO DAIMLER CHRYSLER THAT I SAW A CRASH TEST WITH A DUMMY AND THE SEAT BELT RELEASED UPON IMPACT.  DID THE DUMMY DO SOMETHING WRONG???  WHY DO PEOPLE HAVE TO LOSE THEIR LIVES OR BE SEVERELY INJURED BEFORE A MANUFACTURER IS WILLING TO ADMIT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM OR TRY TO CORRECT IT?  I AM CONTACTING YOU BECAUSE I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL FROM DAIMLER CHRYSLER SO THEY STOP PUTTING THESE DANGEROUS SEAT BELTS IN THE VEHICLES THEY MANUFACTURE.  I WOULD NEED A SEAT BELT THAT WORKS PROPERLY.  PLEASE ADVISE.  THANK YOU, [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
