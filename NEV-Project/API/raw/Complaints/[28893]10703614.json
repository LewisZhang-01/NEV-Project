WILL NOT PROVIDE LOANER AND I DO NOT HAVE ANY OPTIONS FOR WORK TRANSPORTATION WITHOUT IT FOR 3 DAYS.  SO I'M FORCED TO CONTINUE DRIVING IT WITHOUT GETTING THE PARTS FIXED ANYTIME SOON.  ALL 3 RECALLS ITEMS CAN BE DONE IN 1 DAY BASED ON APPROXIMATIONS BUT CHEVY CAN'T GUARANTEE IT WILL BE DONE IN 2 DAYS AND THEY REFUSED TO SETUP AN APPOINTMENT TIME TO BRING IN TO SCHEDULE TASKS ACCORDINGLY.  GROSS NEGLIGENCE BY GM TO GIVE NO PRIORITY FOR CARS THEY SOLD BUT CUSTOMERS THEY CAN'T PROFIT OFF OF.   FILING THIS COMPLAINT INCASE I GET INJURED OR KILLED DUE TO RECALL PARTS AS I WILL WANT THEM TO BE HELD LIABLE.  THANKS.   *TR",
