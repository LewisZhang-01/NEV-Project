FOR EXAMPLE; RPMS WOULD GO FROM 0-3 AND BACK, FUEL WOULD GO FROM E-F AND EVERYWHERE IN BETWEEN, SPEED WOULD FLUCUATE FROM 40-110 ETC.  THIS WOULD ALL HAPPEN AT ONCE WITH ALL THE PANELS.  TOOK TO DEALER AND COULD NOT FIND PROBLEM AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING DID NOT REVEAL THAT THERE EVER WAS A PROBLEM.  FIVE DAYS LATER SAME EXACT PROBLEM EXCEPT NOW THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE WAS ALSO AFFECTED.  STOPPED AT ANOTHER DEALERSHIP AND THEY ALSO COULD NOT DETECT THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM ALTHOUGH THEY COULD SEE THAT THE DISPLAYS WERE STILL NOT WORKING CORRECTLY.  AFTER A CALL TO ENGINEERS THE ONLY THING THEY COULD THINK OF WAS THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER PANEL WAS DEFECTIVE.",
