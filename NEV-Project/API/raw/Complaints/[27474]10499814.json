THE PROBLEM IS ESPECIALLY BAD WHEN THE HEADLIGHTS ARE SET TO \"AUTO.\" AUDI IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE, BUT DOES NOT YET HAVE A RELIABLE FIX FOR THIS ISSUE, AND THEY HAVE NOT VOLUNTARILY ISSUED A RECALL. MY LEFT HEADLIGHT WILL GO OUT IN BOTH DRY AND WET WEATHER. I'M PRETTY SURE IT IS A WIRING/DESIGN DEFECT. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS AND DISTRACTING WHEN MY LEFT HEADLIGHT DIPS WITHOUT WARNING. MY AUDI OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THIS ISSUE. PLEASE PUSH AUDI TO ISSUE A RECALL.  *TR",
