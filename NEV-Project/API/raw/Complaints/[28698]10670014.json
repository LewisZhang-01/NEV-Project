HOWEVER, THE SPYDER'S GAS TANK AND GASOLINE FUEL CONTINUES TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY HOT DURING & AFTER RIDING THE SPYDER.  IN ADDITION AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, SIGNIFICANT FUEL VAPOR FUMES CONTINUE TO BE PRESENT AFTER OPERATING THE SPYDER.    I'M MOST CONCERNED THE HOT GAS TANK, HOT GASOLINE FUEL, AND HEATED FUEL VAPOR FUMES ARE UNSAFE OR DANGEROUS AND COULD CAUSE AN EXPLOSION, FIRE, AND INJURIES TO LIFE AND PROPERTY.  I HAVE ALSO REPORTED THIS CONCERN COMPLAINT TO BRP / CAN-AM AND REQUESTED RESOLUTION BUT HAVE NOT YET HEARD BACK FROM THEM. --- \"WHAT CAN BRP DO ABOUT OVER-HEATED GAS AND DANGEROUS FUEL FUMES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR 2013 SPYDER?\"  *TR",
