FEB 2009 WITH 26000 MILES ON THE CAR THE MOTOR/TRANSMISSION MOUNT BRACKET TORE APART WHILE DRIVING. AXLES, AND ALOT OF OTHER PARTS, DAMAGED.  NEEDLES TO SAY THANK GOD I WAS ONLY DOING 5MPH WHEN INCIDENT OCCURRED.  CAR WAS REPAIRED AT MAZDA DEALER, AND BEFORE I PICKED UP VEHICLE AFTER SUPPOSEDLY BEING FIXED, MOTOR/TRANSMISSION MOUNT FAILED AGAIN WHILE THE MAZDA TECH WAS DRIVING VEHICLE.  MAZDA HAS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THESE CARS THAT THEY DO NOT SEEM TO WANT TO ADDRESS PROPERLY.  THEY REALLY NEED TO FIX THIS PROBLEM NOW BEFORE SOMEONE GETS INJURED SERIOUSLY.  NOT AN ACCEPTABLE PROBLEM ON ANY CAR. *TR",
