I TOOK IT IN AND THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS AND DIAGNOSTICS WEREN'T REPORTING ANY PROBLEMS. THEY RELEASED VEHICLE THAT NEXT DAY AND IT STALLED ON ME IN LOT. THEY STATED THEY COULD NOT GET THE VEHICLE TO STALL YET IT HAPPENED WITHIN FIVE MIN OF ME PICKING IT UP. I THEN TOOK IT BACK THEY KEPT IT FOR THE WEEKEND. RELEASED IT BACK TO ME AFTER I WAS TOLD IT HAD STALLED ONCE BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. I CONTACTED G.M CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEN THE DEALERSHIP WHEN I GOT THE REPORT STATED IT HESITATED AND WHEN I ASKED WHY THEY PUT THAT DOWN AND NOT THAT IT HAD STALLED LIKE THE KATHY HAD TOLD ME ON 3 DIFFERENT OCCASIONS IT HAD DONE, THEY REFUSED TO ANSWER ME. THE CAR STILL STALLS IN TRAFFIC AND THEY REFUSE TO FIX IT. I WILL NO LONGER TAKE IT HERE. I JUST WANT MY CAR TO BE SAFE WHERE I WON'T GET HIT DOING UTURNS INTO TRAFFIC LIKE I ALMOST HAVE BEEN WITH MY BABY THE DAY I PICKED UP VEHICLE. I HAVE TO PUT IT IN PARK TO START IT OVER AGAIN. I CAN'T DO THAT ON THIS BUSY HWY I LIVE ON WITH TRAFFIC COMING AT ME AS FAST AS IT DOES IN THIS CITY. *TR",
