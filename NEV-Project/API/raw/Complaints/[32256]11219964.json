WAIT A MONTH AND PICK UP CAR.  TURNS OUT ONLY WIRING HARNESS WAS REPLACED.  ANOTHER FEW WEEKS AND I GO TO GET ON ANOTHER HIGHWAY IN FAST LANE AND IT HAPPENS AGAIN - LIMP MODE.  TOLD ENGINE NOT REPLACED, NOW IT WILL BE AND WITHOUT THE CAR AGAIN AND ENGINE BACK ORDERED.  DO NOT QUALIFY FOR LEMON LAW - 2 YEARS AND UNDER 11,000 MILES.  HOW DOES SHUTTING DOWN THE ENGINE TO SAVE THE ENGINE BE OF HIGHER CONCERN THAN THE PASSENGERS IN THE VEHICLE????  NOT HAPPY AND NOT MUCH I CAN DO SINCE LEASE.  IF AND WHEN I GET IT BACK ITS BEING TRADED - I REFUSE TO SIT IN IT AGAIN.",
