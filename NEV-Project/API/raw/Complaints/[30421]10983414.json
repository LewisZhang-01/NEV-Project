FOR INSTANCE IF MERGING ONTO THE HIGHWAY THE TRANSMISSION WILL HESITATE AND THE TRUCK WILL BE UNRESPONSIVE TO GAS PEDAL INPUT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SOMETIMES UP TO 12 SECS. THIS HESITATION CAUSES A SAFETY CONCERN WHEN ATTEMPTING TO MERGE INTO TRAFFIC. GM ACKNOWLEDGES THESE CONCERNS BUT STATES THAT IT IS OPERATING AS DESIGNED BUT ARE WORKING ON SOFTWARE UPDATES TO IMPROVE TRANSMISSION PERFORMANCE. THIS HAS BEEN A CONSTANT ISSUE SINCE I PURCHASED THE TRUCK.",
