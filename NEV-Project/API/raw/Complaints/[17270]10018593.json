        "summary": "AFTER 23,000 MILES THE BRAKE LIGHT BEGAN COMING ON ONLY WHEN TAKING OFF QUICKLY FROM A STOP. BRAKES DID NOT SQUEAL AND THERE WAS NO OTHER SIGN THERE COULD BE A PROBLEM EXCEPT FOR THE INTERMITTENT LIGHT COMING ON. I WENT TO THE DEALER TO GET MY OIL CHANGED AND HAD THEM CHECK THE LIGHT WHILE I WAS THERE. THEY TOLD ME THE BRAKE PADS WERE SLIGHTLY WORN, BUT THE ROTORS WERE DOWN TO 30% THICKNESS AND MUST BE REPLACED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THIS CAR IS ONLY A LITTLE OVER A YEAR OLD WITH ONLY 23,000 MILES ON IT! PLUS IT'S A MANUAL TRANSMISSION AND I DOWN SHIFT A LOT TO SLOW THE CAR INSTEAD OF BRAKING. OTHER THAN THAT OCCASIONAL LIGHT, THERE WAS NO INDICATION WHATSOEVER THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES. I NEVER IMAGINED THE ROTORS WOULD WEAR OUT THAT QUICKLY, THEREFORE I MIGHT HAVE JUST IGNORED THE INTERMITTENT LIGHT. THIS IS A SAFETY AND DESIGN ISSUE I THINK CHRYLSER NEEDS TO LOOK INTO.  *JB",
