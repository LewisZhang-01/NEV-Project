I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE IN VIRGINIA AND NEEDED A MARYLAND INSPECTION.  UPON THE INSPECTION, THE MECHANIC NOTICED A LEAK AROUND THE ENGINE.  HE DID NOT INVESTIGATE THE ISSUE, SINCE IT IS NOT AN INSPECTION ITEM.  I AM AFRAID THAT WITH ALL THE OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE RIGHT SIDE HEAD GASKET, THAT THIS IS IN FACT THE PROBLEM.  WILL MY LIMITED POWER TRAIN WARRANTY THAT THE DEALERSHIP GAVE ME COVER THIS COST.  I THINK IT IS A COMPLETE SHAME THAT FORD HAS KNOWLEDGE OF THIS RECURRING PROBLEM BUT DOES NOT OFFER A SOLUTION.  IF THERE ARE ANY PROGRAMS THAT FORD IS OFFERING, I WOULD LIKE TO HERE ABOUT THEM. *JB",
