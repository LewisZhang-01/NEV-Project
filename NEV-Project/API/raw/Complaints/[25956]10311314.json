THIS IS A RANDOM EVENT THAT OCCURS WHEN FIRST APPLYING THE BRAKE. I'VE REPORTED IT SEVERAL TIMES TO MY DEALER AND THE REPLY IS \"TOYOTA SAYS THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES.\" THE LAST TIME WAS TWO WEEKS AGO. SINCE TOYOTA HAS A FIX FOR THE PRIUS I HOPE YOU'LL WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO ADDRESS THE HIGHLANDER HYBRID PROBLEM. BY THE WAY, I AM AN ENGINEER AND RECOGNIZE A PROBLEM WHEN I EXPERIENCE IT. *TR",
