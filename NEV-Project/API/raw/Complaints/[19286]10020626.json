VIN [XXX]  IN A HEAVY RAIN WHEN SUDDENLY THE WIPERS CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT 55 MPH CAUSING A NEAR ZERO VISIBILITY CONDITION. I'VE CHECKED NHTSA FOR COMPLAINTS AND FIND MANY REPORTS FOR THIS SITUATION. MY MECHANIC CALLED A GM DEALER AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS A RECALL TO REPLACE A DEFECTIVE CIRCUIT BOARD. I CONTACTED A GM DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THE RECALL EXTENDED ONLY OUT TO 1997 VEHICLES. MY COMPLAINT IS SIMILAR TO ONE SUBMITTED TO THIS FORUM UNDER ODI ID NUMBER 10016222. THIS IS MOST DEFINITELY A SAFETY HAZARD THAT GM SHOULD BE FORCED TO ADDRESS AND REMEDY WITHOUT LIMITATION AND REIMBURSE THOSE WHO HAVE CORRECTED THE PROBLEM WITH OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
