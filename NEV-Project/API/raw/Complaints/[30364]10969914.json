SO I HAD JUST PICKED UP A SECOND PASSENGER AT A PARKING LOT AND WAS DRIVING AT AROUND 20-25 MPH AND I HAD TO TURN TO GET OUT OF THE PARKING LOT. AS I TRIED TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED ON ME AND GOT A MESSAGE ON MY DASH TO CHECK POWER STEERING. SO I HAD TO BRAKE IMMEDIATELY AND LET THE PASSENGERS KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. I WAS BLOCKING TRAFFIC INTO THE PARKING LOT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. AFTER TURNING THE CAR OFF AND BACK ON AND FORCING THE STEERING WHEEL, I WAS ABLE TO UNLOCK THE WHEEL BUT I WAS STILL VERY HAD TO TURN. TOWED  THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THEY HAD TO REPLACE THE ELECTRIC STEERING SYSTEM ON THE CAR WHICH WAS OVER $1400 OUT OF POCKET. LUCKY I WASN'T DRIVING AT HIGHER SPEEDS IN THE FREEWAY OTHER WISE I DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD OF HAPPENED.",
