THE SERVICE TECH CALLED NISSAN AND ORDERED THE PART FUEL PUMP, WHICH WAS ON BACK ORDER.  NISSAN SAID THEY HAD A NUMBER OF FAILURES BUT NOT RECALLED THE PUMP.  NISSAN ALSO SAID TO REPLACE THE FILTER AND REGULATOR.  THE COST WAS OVER $500.  THIS FAILURE COULD HAVE CAUSED A MAJOR ACCIDENT SINCE FUEL PUMP FAILURE SHUTS THE VEHICLE OFF.",
