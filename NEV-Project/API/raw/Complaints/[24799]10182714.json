I APPLIED A SUDDEN PRESSURE TO THE BRAKES TO SLOW DOWN ALSO; HOWEVER, THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT SOFT AND THEN IT SEEMED LIKE THE BRAKES LOCKED, BUT DID NOT SLOW DOWN.  THE CAR MADE A SUDDEN JOLT TO THE RIGHT BRINGING ME INTO THE ON COMING TRAFFIC IN THE NEXT LANE. THIS RESULTED IN A COLLISION WITH ANOTHER CAR. RESULTING IN A TOTAL LOSS TO THE COBALT.  THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY EVENTHOUGH THE FRONT END OF THE CAR WAS DESTROYED.  *NM",
