THE NEW EMERGENCY BRAKE DESIGN DOES NOT USE THE NORMAL REAR BRAKE PADS..IT HAS ITS OWN SEPERATE BRAKE PAD INSIDE THE WHEEL WELL.  THIS \"EMERGENCY\" PAD BURNS OUT REGARDLESS OF USE.  A CHEVROLET MECHANIC AND DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THIS IS A FAULTY SYSTEM AND THAT I WILL NEED TO RETURN EVERY 15-20 K MILES TO HAVE APPROXIMATELY $130 OF WORK DONE TO ADJUST IT...EVEN IF I DIDN'T USE IT.  THIS IS A HORRIBLE DESIGN AND I WISH CHEVROLET WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR BAD ENGINEERING AND FAULTY SYSTEM.",
