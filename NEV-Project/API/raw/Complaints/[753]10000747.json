I CALLED ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A COMMON PROBLEM, IN FACT, THEY TOLD ME WHAT KIND OF CAR I HAD BEFORE I TOLD THEM,  AND THEY SAID THEY NO LONGER COME OUT ON THAT DEFECT.  THEY SAID THERE ARE A LOT OF PROBLEM WITH THESE MODELS AND THEY HAD MANY CALLS ON THE FORD FOCUS  . I AM JUST OUT OF WARRANTY PERIOD WHICH IS 36000.  I DON'T FEEL THIS IS MY FAULT.  I FEEL IT IS A DEFECT WITH THE PRODUCT.  I HAVE HAD SEVERAL OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH FORD REFUSES TO OWN UP TO, AND I FEEL THE PUBLIC IS BEING SHAMMED WITH THEIR CLAIMS THAT THIS IS THE #1 CAR THEY SELL.   THE STEERING WHEEL IS LOCKED AND I AM STUCK WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO MOVE MY CAR.  HOW COULD I EXPECT THIS TO HAPPEN, I FEEL THIS IS A FORD PROBLEM, I DON'T FEEL THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY  (NOTE:  THIS HAPPENED JAN 6, 2003, BUT YOUR SITE ONLY GOES TO 2002, THEREFORE, I HAD TO USE DEC 31, OTHERWISE I COULD NOT CONTINUE).",
