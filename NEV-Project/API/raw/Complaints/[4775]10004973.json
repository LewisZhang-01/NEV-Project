THE SECOND TIME (WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF FIXING THE FIRST PROBLEM) IT WAS THE MASS AIR METER.  THE THIRD TIME, IT CAME ON 5 HOURS AFTER I WAS REAR-ENDED JANUARY 6TH BUT THE DEALER SAID IT WAS NOT RELATED TO THE ACCIDENT.  THEY SAID IT WAS THE OXYGEN SENSOR.  THE SERVICEMAN I SPOKE WITH AT THE DEALERSHIP SAID HE HAS NOTICED THAT THIS MODEL SEEMS SENSITIVE, CAUSING THE CHECK-ENGINE LIGHT TO COME ON SO FREQUENTLY.  I'M FRUSTRATED THAT NONE OF THIS IS UNDER WARRANTY AND WITH THE FREQUENCY OF THESE OCCURRENCES.",
