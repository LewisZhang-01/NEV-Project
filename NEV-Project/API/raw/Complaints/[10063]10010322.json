        "summary": "MY COMPLIANT IS THAT I WAS BACKING MY CAR UP AND THE FRONT BRAKES LOCKED UP SPECIFICALLY THE RIGHT FRONT.  THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE. YOU COULD SMELL BURNING AND SEE SMOKE FROM THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL.  I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO MY MECHANIC. AFTER EXTENSIVE WORK ON THE CAR WE FOUND OUT THAT THE BRAKE CALIPER PISTON WOULD NOT RETRACT INTO THE CALIPER,  AFTER THE MECHANIC REASSEMBLED THE CAR, HE FOUND OUT THE RIGHT CALIPER WOULD NOT BLEED OUT, AFTER EXTENSIVE TESTING THE CONCLUSION WAS REACHED NO FLUID WOULD COME OUT OF THE PORT ON THE HYDRAULIC CONTROL UNIT TO THAT WHEEL. REPLACEMENT OF THE HCU AND MODULE ASSEMBLY WAS NECESSARY.  MY CAR WAS TOWED TO THE MECHANICS ON 2-06-2003 AND WAS FINALLY FINISHED ON 2-20-2003. THE DELAY IN GETTING THE CAR FINISHED WAS BECAUSE IT WAS THE CONTOUR SVT MODEL 1998, CHANGES IN THE BRAKE PARTS HAD BEEN MADE AND WERE NOT EASY TO OBTAIN. THE FORD DEALER DID NOT HAVE THE PARTS NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE JOB THEY HAD TO BE ORDERED. I HAVE ALL THE PARTS THAT WERE PULLED OFF THE CAR. ALSO LETTER FROM MY MECHANIC. *JB",
