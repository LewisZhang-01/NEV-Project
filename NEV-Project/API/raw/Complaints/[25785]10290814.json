HOWEVER THE CRUISE WOULD NOT READJUST AT THE TOP OF THE INCLINE AND CONTINUED TO GAIN SPEED.  MY HUSBAND TRIED TO BRAKE, TO NO AVAIL, JUST INCREASES IN SPEED(ACT. SPEED UNKNOWN).FINALLY, A BREAK IN TRAFFIC, SHIFTED TO NEUTRAL AND GUIDED THE CAR TO AN EXIT. TURNED OFF CAR, TURNED BACK ON AND ENGINE STILL RACING, FINALLY ON NEXT TRY WENT TO NORMAL. I HAVE NOT USED THE CRUISE SINCE. BUT HEARING OF OTHER TOYOTAS WITH SUA, I'M WONDERING IF THIS IS THE SAME EVEN THOUGH COROLLAS ARE NOT MENTIONED.  WITHOUT A BREAK IN TRAFFIC, I'M CONVINCED THERE COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES TO THIS INCIDENT. CONTACTED TOYOTA AND THEY CHECKED THE CAR WITH NO CONCLUSION TO THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT. THE MAT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE A CAUSE OF THE EVENT. WE ASSUMED THAT IT WAS THE CRUISE CONTROL BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE USED IT . THE CRUISE HAD BEEN ENGAGED FOR AT LEAST 50 MILES BEFORE THE EVENT. THIS WAS A TERRIFYING EVENT FOR MY HUSBAND WHO IS NORMALLY VERY CALM  AND MYSELF. *TR",
