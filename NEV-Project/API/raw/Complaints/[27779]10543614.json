NO ANTILOCKING SHOULD OCCUR LESS THEN 10MPH - THIS IS VERY UNSAFE DUE TO THE FACT THAT BRAKING AT UNDER 10MPH FREQUENTLY INVOLVES BARRIERS IN FRONT OF THE CAR WHERE EVERY INCH OF STOPPING DISTANCE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.    ABS IS FOR WHEN TIRES BREAK STATIC FRICTION ON THE ROAD, AND, I ASSURE YOU THAT NO FRICTION IS BEING BROKEN - THIS IS A SERIOUS FLAW!  *TR",
