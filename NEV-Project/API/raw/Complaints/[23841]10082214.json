        "summary": "PURCHASED 1998 DODGE INTREPID 2.7 IN YEAR 2001 AND ENGINE SHUT DOWN IN SUMMER OF 2002. KEPT UP WITH OIL CHANGES AND HAD OIL IN IT WHEN IT SHUT DOWN. REPLACED ENGINE IN MAY 2002 FOR $4,100. THIS YEAR JUNE 2004 THE ENGINE STARTED KNOCKING REAL LOUD WITH NO WARNING IN THE MIDDLE OF 95 IN VIRGINIA AND SHUTDOWN. HAD TO HAVE THE CAR PUSHED OFF 95 AND HAD POLICE ASSISTANCE TO HAVE  THE CAR TOWED ALL THE WAY BACK TO MARYLAND AND WAS TOLD I NEEDED A NEW ENGINE FOR THE 2ND TIME.... ESTIMATED COST $6.300 PURCHASING ENGINE THROUGH JASPER WHO HAS STATED THE ENGINE HAS OIL LINE ISSUES AND WATER PUMP ISSUES. THEY HAVE REVAMPED AND REDESIGNED (SO THEY SAY TO MAKE IT A BETTER ENGINE) BUT THE COST TO HAVE A 2ND ENGINE IS JUST CRAZY AND I REFUSE TO FIX IT AGAIN.... SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS ENGINE PROBLEM...... IT IS UNFAIR TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRUSTED TO PURCHASE A CAR FROM CHRYSLER/DODGE AND THEN TO HAVE OUR LIVES TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. HOW MAY COMPLAINTS DOES THERE NEED TO BE BEFORE THIS ENGINE IS RECALLED. MYSELF AND OTHERS DO TO RESEARCH ON ANOTHER SITE WWW.AUTOSAFETY.ORG HAVE COMPLAINED AND HAVE BEEN TREATED UNFAIRLY AND HAVE LOST LOTS OF MONEY AND MOST OF US STILL OWE A BALANCE FOR THE CAR ITSELF... PLEASE SOMEONE HEAR US AND HELP!!!!  I HAVE CALLED CHRYSLER AND THE DEALERSHIP WHERE THE CAR WAS PURCHASED AND THEY REFUSE TO HELP...... **(INFORMATION GIVEN FOR MILEAGE WAS 96000 AFTER PURCHASE THEN ON SECOND ENGINE THAT WAS INSTALLED WAS SAID TO HAVE ONLY 12000 MILES AND ONLY PUT 29000 ON IT UNTIL JUNE 18TH, 2004.)****  THANK YOU,  TERRY AMATO.    *JB",
