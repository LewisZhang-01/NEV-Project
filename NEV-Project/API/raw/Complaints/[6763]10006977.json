        "summary": "SOME HISTORY OF THE PROBLEM WE'RE HAVING...ON MARCH 24,2002 WHEN WE WERE RESPONDING TO AN EMERGENCY CALL WE DROVE OVER A SMALL WATER WAY IN THE STREET OF OUR TOWN. A LOUD NOISE WAS HEARD AND THE AMBULANCE LEANED TO THE RIGHT SIDE. AT THIS POINT TWO OF THE U POINTS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF OUR AMBULANCE FAILED CAUSING A TIRE TO BLOW OUT AND MADE A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE AMBULANCE. NEEDLESS TO SAY OUR AMBULANCE WASN'T IN RUNNING CONDITION. I CALLED THE DEALER THEY TOLD ME WHERE TO TAKE IT AND HOW TO HAVE IT TRANSPORTED. NOW OUR AMBULANCE IS A 2000 FORD TRUCK. WHEN WE ORDERED THE AMBULANCE WE ADDED ON A VELVET RIDE SUSPENSION FOR ADDED COMFORT FOR OUR PATIENTS WE TRANSPORT. REMEMBER WE LIVE IN MINNESOTA WHERE THE ROADS ARE VERY ROUGH FOR A GREATER PART OF A YEAR. THE ADDED COAT OF THIS WAS $3800., BUT WE FELT IT WAS WORTH IT. HERE IS WHERE THE PROBLEM BEGINS. BF GOODRICH ADDED THE SUSPENSION, SINCE THEN SOLD IT TO A LORD COMPANY. THESE PEOPLE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PROBLEMS. AS A MATTER OF FACT, ONE TIME WHEN I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH A MIKE FOSTER, HE WAS WHISTLING. ANYWAY THE FORD DEALERSHIP TOLD US THE U BOLTS WERE MADE OF POOR GRADE STEEL WHICH CAUSED THEM TO BREAK. I SINCE THEN  RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM THE DEALER IN OHIO WITH MANY PROBLEMS.   *PH       *JB    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**763294",
