A MECHANIC DIAGNOSED THE ISSUE AS THE FAILURE OF THE FRONT BUSHING ON THE LOWER CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLY ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE VEHICLE.  THIS ISSUE IS ADDRESSED IN SUBARU SERVICE BULLETIN NUMBER 05-63-18R DATED 06/20/18 AND REVISED ON 07/10/18.  IT EFFECTS 2014 TO 2018 MODEL YEAR FORESTERS AND THE 2015 MODEL YEAR FOR THE CROSSTREK HYBRID MODEL.  NEW BUSHINGS WERE RECENTLY INCORPORATED INTO PRODUCTION.  SUBARU WILL NOT MAKE THE REPAIR BECAUSE I HAVE OVER 36000 MILES ON MY VEHICLE (ACTUALLY MILEAGE IS JUST OVER 56K).  MY VEHICLE IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE IN THIS CONDITION.  I NEED TWO HANDS ON THE WHEEL TO CONTROL IT.  THE ISSUE STARTED ONE WEEK AGO AND IS GETTING WORSE EACH DAY, BUT SUBARU IS NOT TAKING ANY RESPONSIBILITY.  I AM AFRAID THAT IF IT CONTINUES TO WORSEN IT COULD RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT WITH THE VEHICLE.",
