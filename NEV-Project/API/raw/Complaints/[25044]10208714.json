THIS HAS NOW HAPPENED A TOTAL OF 8 TIMES.  ONE TIME I WAS IN A PLACE TO SEE HOW FAR IT WOULD GO.  FROM A SPEED OF 65, THE TRANSMISSION SUDDENLY DOWNSHIFTED AND THE CAR ACCELERATED TO 90 MILES PER HOUR.  IT DISCONNECTED WHEN I HIT THE BRAKE.  ON TWO OTHER OCCASIONS, WHILE DRIVING ON THIS TRIP, AFTER DISCONNECTING THE CRUISE CONTROL BY APPLYING THE BRAKE, THE CRUISE CONTROL SUDDENLY RECONNECTED WITH OUT ANY INPUT FROM ME.  I FEEL THAT THESE TYPE UNCOMMANDED INPUTS ARE DANGEROUS AND ASK FOR AN INVESTIGATION TO SEE IF THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH GM VEHICLES.  *TR",
