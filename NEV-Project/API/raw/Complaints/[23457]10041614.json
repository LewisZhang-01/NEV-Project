ACCORDING TO DOCUMENTATION IN VARIOUS ENGINE REFERENCE BOOKS FAILURE OF THE VALVE COULD CAUSE ERRATIC ENGINE SURGES AND POTENTIAL OTHER RELATED PROBLEMS TO INCLUDE FAILURE OF THE POWER PLANT.  THERE ARE APPARENTLY NO REPLACEMENT PARTS AVAILABLE FOR THE 4.0L V-6 WHICH IS A COMMON ENGINE IN THE RANGER AND EXPLORER MODELS. THE VEHICLE CURRENTLY HAS 42000 HIGHWAY MILES AND RECEIVES REGULAR MAINTENANCE.  I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE LOW LIFE OF THIS PART UNDER NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR AND CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS THE SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THAT THE PART FAILURE COULD CAUSE.  *LA",
