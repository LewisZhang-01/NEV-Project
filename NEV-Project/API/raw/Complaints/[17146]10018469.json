BRAKES WERE CHECKED OUT AT A LOCAL BRAKE SHOP AND RECOMMENDED REPLACEMENT OF THE REAR BRAKES.  AT THAT TIME THE CAR ONLY HAD 15,000 MILES ON IT.  IT NOW HAS 29,000 MILES ON IT AND THE NOISE IS EVEN LOUDER.  I CONTACTED THE DEALER AND THEY SAID IF THERE ISN'T ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE BRAKES I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE BRAKE CHECK AND THE REPLACEMENT OF THE REAR BRAKES.  BRAKES DON'T NORMALLY GO BAD THAT FAST UNLESS SOMETHING IS WRONG!!  *JB",
