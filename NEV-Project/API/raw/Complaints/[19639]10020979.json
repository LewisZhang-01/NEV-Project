        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING MY 2001 XTERRA ON INTERSTATE 495 WHEN THE CAR ABRUPTLY LOST POWER AND STALLED WHILE TRAVELING 65 MPH.  AFTER REPEATED ATTEMPTS TO START THE CAR, IT STARTED AFTER 20 MINUTES.  I LET THE CAR RUN FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES BEFORE REENTERING THE HIGHWAY.  ABOUT TWO MILES DOWN THE ROAD THE CAR SUDDENLY LOST POWER, STALLED AND WOULD NOT RESTART.  I HAD THE CAR TOWED AND A BAD FUEL PUMP/FUEL SENDING UNIT WAS DIAGNOSED.  THE FUEL INJECTORS WERE DRY, AS IF THE CAR HAD RUN OUT OF GAS, BUT I HAD THREE QUARTERS OF A TANK.  IT IS WELL DOCUMENTED ON THE INTERNET ON NISSAN OWNER'S SITES THAT THE NISSAN FRONTIER AND XTERRAS EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS WITH THE FUEL PUMP SENDING UNITS.  THE RESULT OF SUCH FAILURES IS NO GAS DELIVERY TO THE ENGINE, AS IF THE VEHICLE HAS RUN OUT OF GAS.  THE FAILURE COMES WITHOUT WARNING AND DOES NOT SEEM TO BE RELATED TO MODEL YEAR.  IT IS APPARENT THAT SUCH FAILURES IN A GAS DELIVERY SYSTEM IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD.  I BELIEVE NISSAN IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR THERE WAS A NATIONAL BACKORDER FOR THIS PART.  *NLM",
