THE FAILURE IS WHERE THE QUICK-CONNECT FUEL LINE CONNECTOR SCREWS INTO THE FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY. THE ASSEMBLY IS PLASTIC AND HAS VERTICAL CRACKS. THE DEALER WANTS OVER $700 TO FIX THIS. I HAVE TEMPORARILY FIXED IT WITH YELLOW THREAD TAPE, BUT AM CONCERNED IT WILL LEAK AGAIN. I KNOW SEVERAL OTHER WITH BMW MOTORCYCLE OWNERS WITH THIS DANGEROUS PROBLEM.
