THIS PROBLEM JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN WHEN THE CAR IS COLD, BUT ALSO HAPPENS WHILE HIGHWAY DRIVING & CHANGING SPEEDS. IT OFTEN TAKES TOO LONG FOR MY VEHICLE TO CHANGE GEARS. I HAVE REPORTED THIS PROBLEM TO THE SERVICE DEPT. AT TWO DIFFERENT SUBARU DEALERSHIPS. THEY CLAIM THEY CHECKED MY TRANSMISSION & FOUND NO PROBLEMS. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE I AM CONCERNED ABOUT. I FEAR MY TRANSMISSION MAY FAIL AT A CRUCIAL TIME. *TR",
