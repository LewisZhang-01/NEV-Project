UNFORTUNATELY, THE INITIAL PROBLEMS OCCURRED BEYOND THE LEMON CAR LIMIT IN OUR STATE AND CONTINUE TODAY.  IN SEPTEMBER 2017  I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO A CHEVY DEALER AFTER NOTICING SIGNIFICANT EXHAUST FUMES IN THE CABIN PARTICULARLY WHILE STATIONARY DURING START UP. IT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A CRACKED MANIFOLD.  THE MANIFOLD HAD ALREADY BEEN REPLACED IN JANUARY OF 2016 AS PART OF AN ENGINE REBUILD AT GM'S EXPENSE.  THIS WOULD THEREFORE BE THE THIRD MANIFOLD IN THIS VEHICLE IN ONLY SIX YEARS. BOTH THE DEALER AND I FILED WITH GM CUSTOMER CARE TO REQUEST COVERAGE FOR THE MANIFOLD REPLACEMENT. I HAVE NOT YET HEARD BACK BUT REMAIN HOPEFUL THAT GM WILL ONCE AGAIN STEP UP AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY.",
