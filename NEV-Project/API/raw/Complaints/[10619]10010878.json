FUEL GAUGE IS INACCURATE AND JUMPS AROUND WHEN TRUCK IS NOT IN A MOVING GEAR.  I AM VERY UPSET ABOUT THE LAST TWO, BECAUSE CHEVY SAYS THE TRUCK IS WORKING WITHIN \"NORMAL CHEVY PARAMETER\".  I HAVE ASKED MANY MECHANICS AND THEY SAY EITHER ONE SHOULD BE HAPPENING.  THE DATE BELOW IS AN APPROXIMATE TIME THE LAST TWO STARTED.  I ALSO HAVE HAD IT IN TWICE FOR BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS.  *JB",
