THE DEALER ADVISES THAT GM HAS NO \"FIX\" FOR THIS DANGEROUS PROBLEM AND, INSTEAD, HAS HAD ME REMOVE THE FUSE TO THE \"ON-THE-FLY\" 4 WHEEL DRIVE. THIS LEAVES ME WITH A 2 WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLE ONLY. THE PROBLEM IS CONSTANT ONCE IT STARTS. AT 35 TO 45 MPH, CONTROL IS DIFFICULT WHEN YOU ARE SURPRISED BY THIS DRASTIC SHIFT TO LOW RANGE 4X4. MY BROTHER AND I BOUGHT TWO IDENTICLE VEHICLES IN DECEMBER 2002 AND HIS IS DOING THE SAME THING.  GM AND THE DEALER HAVE BEEN OF ABSOLUTELY NO ASSISTANCE AT ALL. THE PROBLEM CONTINUES AND HAS VERY SERIOUS POTENTIAL.",
