        "summary": "FAILURE OCCURS BELOW 15MPH WHILE DOING A NORMAL STOP ON BOTH WET AND DRY ROAD (WITH NO CONTAMINANTS ON THE ROAD TO AFFECT BRAKING).   THIS HAS HAPPENED EIGHT TIMES IN THE 8500 MILES I HAVE DRIVEN THE VEHICLE, WITH THE EIGHTH TIME RESULTING IN AN ACCIDENT.   EVENT COURSE IS THAT I AM COMING TO A NORMAL STOP, AND WHILE MY FOOT IS ON THE BRAKE I PUSH SLIGHTLY MORE ON THE PEDAL IN AN INSTANCE WHERE A LITTLE MORE BRAKE IS NEEDED TO STOP BEFORE WHERE I HAD ORIGINALLY PLANNED.   IMMEDIATELY THE ABS KICKS IN (I CAN HEAR A WHIRRING SOUND BUT THE BRAKES PEDAL DOES NOT FLUCTUATE), AND I LOOSE ABOUT 50% OF THE BRAKING POWER RIGHT WHEN I NEED MORE TO STOP SOONER.  OBVIOUSLY THE VEHICLE KEEPS MOVING FORWARD PAST WHERE I NEED IT TO STOP.   THIS VEHICLE IS OWNED BY SEATTLE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND IS A MAINTENANCE VEHICLE.  THE MAINTENANCE SHOP AND DEALER CLAIM THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE, AND I HAVE REFUSED TO DRIVE IT.  REAR WHEEL BEARING SEALS HAVE BEEN REPLACED.   I HAVE BEEN DRIVING OVER 40 YEARS AND HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS TYPE OF RESPONSE FROM ANY OTHER VEHICLE I HAVE DRIVEN. / PLEASE NOTE ON YOUR WEB PAGE, I COULD NOT MAKE A SELECTION FOR ANYTHING BUT A 'PASSENGER VEHICLE'.   THIS IS A VAN.",
