        "summary": "I TOOK POSSESSION OF A BRAND-NEW HYUNDAI SANTA FE (2003 - 25 MILES ON ODOMETER) ON FRIDAY, JUNE 20, 2003.  SATURDAY, JUNE 21,2003 I TOOK THE CAR OUT FOR A DRIVE.  DRIVING AT 35 MILES MPH THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTED (BY IT SELF) OUT OF \"DRIVE (D\") INTO ...? (NEUTRAL, I'M GUESSING BY THE REVVING OF THE ENGINE).  THE CAR ROLLED SLOWLY DUE TO ITS OWN FORWARD MOMENTUM, HOWEVER, PRESSING ON ACCELERATOR SUCCEEDING IN ONLY REVVING UP THE ENGINE - \"DRIVE\" REFUSED TO ENGAGE.  SEVERAL ATTEMPTS WERE FUTILE.  I SHUT THE CAR DOWN (AFTER LIMPING TO THE SIDE OF A 6-LANE ROAD IN TRAFFIC!).  WAITED A FEW MOMENTS (PERHAPS A MINUTE OR TWO) AND RESTARTED THE CAR.  THE TRANSMISSION ONCE MORE WOULD NOT ENGAGE INTO DRIVE.  I SHUT THE CAR DOWN AGAIN AND WAITED A LITTLE LONGER (PERHAPS TWO -THREE MINUTES) AND STARTED IT AGAIN.  THIS TIME THE TRANSMISSION ENGAGED AND I DROVE IT HOME - VERY CAREFULLY!  I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP (KEYES HYUNDAI IN VAN NUYS) AND HAD THE CAR FLATBED TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP.  I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE.  I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL MONDAY, JUNE 23 AT 7:30A.M. (PST) FOR THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO OPEN.  MEANTIME - I HAVE A BRAND NEW CAR THAT HAS SPENT ONE DAY IN MY PHYSICAL POSSESSION AND WILL HAVE SPENT OVER 72 HOURS SITTING IN THE DEALERSHIPS SERVICE BAY!    *NLM",
