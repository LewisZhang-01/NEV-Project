        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 2006 PONTIAC G6 IN SEPT 05, IN DEC 05 I WENT TO GO TO WORK ON A MONDAY AND THE BATTERY WAS DEAD. I HAD NOT USED THE CAR THE DAY BEFORE. MY SON JUMPSTARTED IT AND I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER THE NEXT DAY. THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT. TWO WEEKS LATER IT HAPPENED AGAIN AND I HAD THE CAR TOWED. THE DEALER SAID THAT THE BATTERY COULDN'T HOLD A CHARGE AND THEY REPLACED MY BATTERY. IN FEB 06, THE CAR BATTERY WAS DEAD AGAIN, I HAD IT TOWED AGAIN. THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG AND TOLD ME THAT I DON'T DRIVE THE CAR ENOUGH TO RECHARGE THE BATTERY. I DRIVE MY CAR BETWEEN 17 TO 20 MILES A DAY. THEY RECHARGED THE BATTERY AND TWO WEEKS LATER IT WAS DEAD AGAIN. THE DEALER TALKED WITH GM TECH SUPPORT WHO ALSO AGREED WITH THE DEALER THAT I DON'T DRIVE MY CAR ENOUGH. THEY ALSO CHECKED THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AND THE PARASITIC DRAW AND THEY ALL ARE FINE. ONCE AGAIN THEY RECHARGED MY BATTERY. ONE MONTH LATER IN MARCH THE BATTERY WAS DEAD AGAIN. THE DEALER FOLLOWED THE SAME PROCEDURE AS BEFORE AND TOLD ME THAT GM TECH SUPPORT SAYS THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY CAR AND NO FURTHER TESTS WILL BE DONE. THEY AGREED TO LET ME COME IN AND HAVE THE BATTERY TESTED EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE. APPROX TWO WEEKS LATER THE BATTERY WAS TESTED AND IT WAS FAILING SO THEY REPLACED MY BATTERY AGAIN.  I CONTINUED TO HAVE MY BATTERY TESTED UNTIL THE END OF APRIL. I DIDN'T HAVE ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH IT UNTIL JULY 06 WHEN THE BATTERY WAS DEAD AGAIN. I HAD IT JUMPSTARTED AND BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALERSHIP THE NEXT DAY. THEY CHECKED THE BATTERY AND  THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AGAIN AND FOUND NOTHING. ALL WAS WELL UNTIL NOV 06 WHEN THE BATTERY WAS DEAD AGAIN. I HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALER AND AGAIN THEY RECHARGED THE BATTERY AND CHECKED THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM. THE DEALER ONLY KEEPS THE CAR OVERNIGHT AND HAS NOT TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE CAR.  THE CAR STARTS NORMALLY WITH NO PROBLEM AND THEN THE NEXT DAY THE BATTERY IS COMPLETELY DEAD.  *NM",
