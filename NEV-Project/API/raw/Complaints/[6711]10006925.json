I HAVE CONTACTED OLDSMOBILE CUSTOMER SERVICE, THE DEALER AND GM CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS. THEY ALL SAY THERE IS NO CONTINUING DEFECT, BUT THEY REPLACED THE ROTORS BEFORE AND WILL DO IT ONE LAST TIME AT NO CHARGE. NOT ONLY IS IT FRUSTRATING TO HAVE TO KEEP RETURNING TO THE DEALER TO REPAIR THE SAME PROBLEM. BUT IT IS ALSO A SAFETY ISSUE.  THE ROTORS ARE WARPING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED, 70 MPH WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED HARSHLY. THE STEERING WHEEL SHAKES SO HARD IT CAUSES YOU TO LOOSE GRIP OF IT. I KNOW OF TWO TSB'S WRITTEN ON THIS PROBLEM, #00-05-23-002 AND #00-22-002. I ALSO WENT TO THE ALERO WEB SITE AND THERE ARE 58 ENTRIES FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE SAYING THEY HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. *PH *JB    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**748277",
