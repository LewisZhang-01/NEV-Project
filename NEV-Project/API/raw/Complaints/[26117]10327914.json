IT HAS SINCE BEEN DETERMINED THAT MY RADIATOR IS LEAKING WHERE THE PLASTIC AND METAL PARTS ARE \"SEALED\" TOGETHER.  UNFORTUNATELY I WAS OUT OF MY 36K BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY & THIS PART IS NOT COVERED UNDER FORD'S POWERTRAIN WARRANTY.  I CONTINUE TO DRIVE MY VEHICLE BUT CHECK THE RADIATOR COOLANT LEVEL WEEKLY.  THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT AN IDENTICAL RADIATOR WILL NOT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.  THEREFORE, WE ARE HESITANT TO PAY THE $800 THE DEALERSHIP ASKED FOR TO FIX.      ALSO, THE BACK DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR SOMETIMES WILL NOT OPEN.  IT APPEARS TO LOCK & UNLOCK BUT THE DOOR DOESN'T CATCH THE HOOK TO RELEASE & OPEN. *TR",
