MOST PRONOUNCED IN CRUISE CONTROL BETWEEN 20-50 MPH WITH A/C OFF.   REPAIR EFFORT:  AFTER (4) REPAIR CYCLES WITHIN LOCAL DEALER'S SHOP, THE LAST WITH FORD FIELD ENGINEERING PRESENT, HAVE IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM TO BE ISOLATED TO THE \"EXHAUST GAS RECYCLING VALVE\". SINCE THE \"FFE\" ENGINE IS DESIGN TO WORK WITH BOTH ETHANOL AND STANDARD GASOLINE, IT IS BELIEVED THE OPENING AND CLOSING CYCLE OF THE EGR VALVE IS INCORRECT FOR USE WITH STANDARD GASOLINE.  THE FOURTH AND FINAL REPAIR REPORT STATES EGR IS THE CAUSE OF THE AUTO PERFORMANCE PROBLEM. THE OWNER FIRMLY BELIEVES THIS EGR PROBLEM IS ALSO THE CAUSE OF PERIODIC MOTION FELT WITHIN THE CAR, WHICH MAY CAUSE FEELINGS OF \"NAUSEA\" POSSIBLY DUE TO \"MOTION SICKNESS\" TO THE DRIVER AND ANY OCCUPANTS IN THE CAR.  DEALER MECHANICS AND THE SERVICE MANAGER HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN REPEATING THE PERFORMANCE PROBLEM DURING TEST DRIVES AND CAN STOP PROBLEM BY DISCONNECTING OF PORTION OF ERG SYSTEM.  FORD FIELD ENGINEERING FINAL DECISION ON REPAIR: \"NO REPAIR NECESSARY, THIS EFFECT IS NORMAL FOR THIS TYPE OF ENGINE\".  AUTO OWNER IS NOW USING \"DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BOARD\" WITHIN FORD MOTOR COMPANY TO RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM.   OWNER BELIEVES THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM FALLS UNDER \"DEFECTIVE PRODUCT\" STATUTE.  *JB",
