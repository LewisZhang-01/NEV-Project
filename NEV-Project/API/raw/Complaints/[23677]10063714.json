ENGINE ALSO EXHIBITS UNEVEN/ODD ACCELERATION BEHAVIOR, OFTEN LAGGING NOTICEABLY AT SPEED.  I'VE HAD THE CAR AT THE DEALER TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM ON 4 OCCASIONS IN THE PAST YEAR (19K MILES) WITH ZERO RESOLUTION.  BECAUSE THE CAR ISN'T THROWING AN ERROR CODES, I GUESS THAT I HAVE TO JUST \"LIVE WITH IT\".  NOT ACCEPTABLE.  THIS CAN BE A DANGEROUS ISSUE, ESPECIALLY WHEN COASTING TO A STOP.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE BMW FINALLY STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.  I JUST SHOULDN'T HAVE TO LIVE WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS, IN THIS DAY IN AGE, AND WITH A MASS-PRODUCED CAR.  *AK",
