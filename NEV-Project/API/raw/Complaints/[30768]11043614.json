        "summary": "THE 2005 MAZDA TRIBUTE S (3.0L V6), ALSO KNOWN AS THE 2005 FORD ESCAPE (SAME PARTS, ASSEMBLY LINE, PCM, ETC) HAS A KNOWN ISSUE THAT CAN BE TRACKED THROUGH MANY, MANY TSBS. MAZDA/FORD USED THE INCORRECT AND FAULTY SPARK PLUGS IN THEIR 2005 TRIBUTES AND ESCAPES. THESE PLUGS GENERATE TOO MUCH RF NOISE AND THEIR FAULTY COIL-ON-PLUG DESIGNED IGNITION SYSTEM DOES NOT PROVIDE ANYWHERE NEAR ENOUGH SUPPRESSION FOR THE EXCESSIVE RF NOISE. THESE ISSUES COMBINES CAUSE THE PCM TO LITERALLY FRY OUT AND BURN AND CRACK THE IGNITION COILS AT THE SAME TIME. DUE TO MAZDA AND FORD'S TOTAL LACK OF SAFETY CONCERN OR ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE, THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF TRIBUTES AND ESCAPES HAVE ENGINE MISFIRING ISSUES (ROUGH IDLES, ENGINE KNOCKS, EVENTUAL COIL FAILURE) THAT GO UNDIAGNOSED AND CAUSES UNBURNED FUEL TO PUSH THROUGH THE TOP CATALYTIC CONVERTERS WHICH IN TURN DAMAGES THEM AS WELL. AGAIN, THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE, SEEN IN MANY TSBS THAT MAZDA AND FORD WILL NOT ADDRESS. RESULTS ASIDE FROM EXTREME DAMAGE TO THE MOST CORE COMPONENTS OF THE VEHICLE INCLUDE ENGINE MISFIRING AND CAR SHUTTING DOWN COMPLETELY MID-DRIVE (WE'RE TALKING 65MPH ON THE HIGHWAY). THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM THAT THEY WILL NOT ADDRESS AND IS SEEN IN MOST IF NOT ALL 2005 TRIBUTES AND ESCAPES, TYPICALLY AROUND THE 90K MILE MARK. NHTSA NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS AS THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY MATTER. MY 2005 MAZDA TRIBUTE HAS BURNED THROUGH 6 IGNITION COILS AND SPARK PLUGS, DIED WHILE I WAS DRIVING SEVERAL TIMES, MISFIRES FREQUENTLY AND AT RANDOM AND FINALLY THE ISSUE HAS FRIED MY PCM, WHICH IN TURN TOOK OUT ALL 6 IGNITION COILS AT THE SAME TIME. THANKFULLY, I WAS PARKED WHEN THIS ISSUE OCCURRED THIS TIME.",
