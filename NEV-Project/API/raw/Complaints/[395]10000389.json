        "summary": "AFTER HAVING SEVERAL INSTANCES OF THE FAILURE OF THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL OF MY 2002 FORD F250 CREW CAB DIESEL PICKUP TRUCK, I ASKED THE LOCAL FORD DEALER (JONES-WEST FORD OF RENO, NEVADA) TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEMS. THE DIAGNOSIS WAS THAT ON THE DIESEL F250, THERE IS AN ELECTRIC GAS-PEDAL VS. ONE THAT IS DIRECTLY CONNECTED VIA CONTROL LINKAGE; ON MY FORD F250 THE ELECTRIC GAS-PEDAL WAS EXPERIENCING AN INTERMITTENT FAILURE. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE DEALER??S SERVICE MANAGER COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM (OR ADMIT THAT HE DID), THE DEALER REFUSED TO COVER THE PART UNDER WARRANTY; A $ 100 PART FOR A $ 45,000, 6-MONTH OLD VEHICLE. FURTHER, BECAUSE THE TRUCK WOULD NOT GENERATE A COMPUTER CODE SHOWING THE EXACT FAILURE MODE, THE FORD DEALERSHIP WAS INCAPABLE OF DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM, AS THEIR TECHNICIANS ARE ONLY COMPUTER-READERS, YET THEY WERE AWARE THAT THE PROBLEM EXISTED BY THE DISCLOSURE THAT THEY HAD SERVICED 5 PREVIOUS F-250 TRUCKS WITH THE EXACT PROBLEM WITH THE ELECTRIC ACCELERATOR-PEDAL WITHIN THE LAST FEW MONTHS.   THE TRUCK OWNER PAID THE $ 162.89 TO THE JONES-WEST FORD DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THE NEWER VERSION OF THE GAS PEDAL INSTALLED AFTER THE JONES-WEST SERVICE MANAGER (BUD) REFUSED TO HONOR THE FORD WARRANTY FOR THE 11,700 MILE-OLD VEHICLE.  APPARENTLY A LACK OF INTEGRITY STILL AFFECTS THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY NOT LONG AFTER THE FORD EXPLORER/FIRESTONE TIRE PROBLEM, WHICH LED TO 100 DEATHS.  TS",
