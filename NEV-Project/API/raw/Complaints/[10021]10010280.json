MY VEHICLE IS OVER 36000 MILES SO IS NO LONGER COVERED BY WARRANTY, HOWEVER, THE CAR WAS REGULARLY MAINTAINED AND THE ENGINE ALWAYS HAD OIL.  THE ENGINE SHUT OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY WITH NO WARNING.    I BELIEVE THIS VEHICLE IS DEFECTIVE AND DANGEROUS.  I CONTACTED FORD AND THEY WERE UNWILLING TO HELP.  I AM STUCK WITH A $6000 BILL TO REPLACE THE ENGINE.*JB",
