SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE LAST FOUR YEARS (AT LEAST 5 DISTINCT TIMES I RECALL), THE ABS SEEMED TO FAIL.  ALL THE INCIDENTS OCCURRED WHEN I WAS ATTEMPTING TO STOP RAPIDLY ON A ROUGH/BUMPY ROAD.  THE SYMPTOMS ARE THE SAME EACH TIME:  AFTER STARTING TO BRAKE NORMALLY, THE BRAKE PEDAL DROPS A BIT AND THERE IS A GRINDING NOISE FOR A FEW MOMENTS (A SECOND OR TWO AT MOST) ALONG WITH SOME SIGNIFICANT RESISTANCE TO THE PRESSURE OF MY FOOT ON THE PEDAL, THEN THE RESISTANCE AND THE GRINDING DISAPPEAR, AND I LOSE THE POWER BRAKES.   IF I LIFT MY FOOT OFF THE PEDAL AND PRESS DOWN AGAIN, THE POWER BRAKES ARE RESTORED.   THE LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED (APRIL 6), I NEARLY REAR-ENDED SOMEONE AT A STOP LIGHT.  I HAVE COMPLAINED OF THIS PROBLEM TO MULTIPLE DEALER MECHANICS, BUT THEY HAVE ALL STATED THAT THIS IS THE NORMAL WAY FOR ABS TO WORK.  AFTER THE LAST INCIDENT, I REMOVED THE ABS FUSE.          *JB",
