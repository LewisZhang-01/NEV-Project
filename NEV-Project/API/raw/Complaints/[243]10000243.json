        "summary": "DEAR SIRS, I OWN A 2000 CHEVY TAHOE, THAT I BOUGHT NEW. OCACIONALLY THE ENGINE ( 5.3 L), WOULD STALL WITHOUT WARNING. USUALLY WHEN BRAKING BUT JUST BEFORE A COMPLETE STOP.IT ALWAYS HAPPENED WHEN THE ENGINE WAS AT OPERATING TEMP.I ALSO NOTICED THAT THE ENGINE, AT  IDLE, WOULD DIP DOWN TO 200- 300 RPM'S, WITH THE A/C OR DEFROSTER ON, AND THE ENGINE WOULD STUMBLE AND SHAKE THE VEHICLE. IF I TAP THE GAS PEDDLE A LITTLE, IT PRODUCES THE SAME RESULTS.I TOOK THE TRUCK TO HARBOR CHEVERLET, MICHIGAN CITY ON 2-25-02  FOR SERVICE AFTER IT HAD STALLED ON ME 8-10 TIMES SINCE NEW,AND THEY REPROGRAMMED THE PCM PER TSB #00-07-30-006, AND SENT ME ON MY WAY WITH 33092 MILES ON THE TRUCK. I RETURNED TO THE DEALER AGAIN ON 4-12-02 ,SAME COMPLAINT. THEY SAID NO PROBLEM FOUND AT THIS TIME. IT IS NOW 12-18-02 AND IN THE LAST MONTH IT HAS STALLED AROUND 15-20 DURING IDLE CONDITIONS.THERE ARE NO OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE ENGINE OTHER THAN AT IDLE. I AM TAKING IT BACK TO THE DEALER ON SATUDAY WITH 49000 MILES ON, AND OUT OF WARRANTY TO SEE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT FIXING IT. DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FOR THIS VEHICLE AND PROBLEM, AND COULD YOU E-MAIL THAT TO ME? THANK YOU.",
