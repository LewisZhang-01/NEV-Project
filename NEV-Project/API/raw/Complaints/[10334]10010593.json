THE MECHANIC SAID THAT THIS IS A KNOW ISSUE RELATED TO THE DEX COOL COOLANT.  HE ALSO SAID THAT THERE IS A TSB THAT INSTRUCTS THE MECHANIC TO FLUSH AND REPLACE THE FLUID.  MY COMPLAINT IS WITH THE OEM FOR NOT INFORMING ME OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE COOLANT.  IF I WOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE PROBLEM, THEN I WOULD HAVE HAD THE SERVICE PERFORMED BEFORE DAMAGING MY COOLANT SYSTEM.  THE DAMAGE COST ME ABOUT $2000 IN REPAIRS TO REPLACE THE RADIATOR, WATER PUMP AND SENSORS.   *NLM",
