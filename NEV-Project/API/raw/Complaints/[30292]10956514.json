TOLD ME THAT THE POWER STEERING BOX WAS SHOT AND HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME AS THE LIQUID WAS EMPTY.  KNOWING THE VEHICLE'S HISTORY I SAID OH REALLY, MY PARENTS HAD THE VEHICLE IN HERE YEARS AGO RE: THE WHINING WHEN THEY TURN THE STEERING WHEEL AND THEY  HAD SAID THAT WAS NORMAL.  THAT WAS BACK IN 2012.  NOW I HAVE TO PAY $1600 TO GET IT FIXED.  HOW CONVENIENT NOW THAT IT IS OUT OF THE WARRANTY PERIOD AS IT IS A 10 HOUR JOB.  WHEN I ASKED THE DEALER IF THEY HAVE HEARD OF SUCH COMPLAINTS RE: THE STEERING THEY SAID NO.  THEN I TOLD HIM ABOUT MY FRIEND WHO OWNS A CHEVY TRAVERESE AND THEY HAD THEIR POWER STEERING BOX REPLACED TWO YEARS AGO.  THEY SERVICE PERSON JUST ACTED LIKE OH WELL.",
