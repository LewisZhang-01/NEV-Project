        "summary": "I BOUGHT A 2000 TOYOTA COROLLA VE IN AUGUST 2001 WITH 33,000 MILES ON IT.  THE CAR HAS BEEN SERVICED REGULARLY, OIL CHANGES ETC.  ON MAY 27, 2003, THE VEHICLE STOPPED ON THE INTERSTATE AFTER MAKING A TERRIBLE NOISE IN THE ENGIN.  THE TOYOTA DEALER NOW SAYS THE ENGINE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE OF LACK OF LUBRICATION.  THE VEHICLE HAD AN OIL CHANGE TWO WEEKS BEFORE AND THERE WAS NO OIL IN THE CAR TWO WEEKS LATER.  THE ENGINE HAS BEEN USING EXCESSIVE OIL.  WE HAVE HAD TO ADD OIL REGULARLY.  THE DEALER NOW WANTS $2500 TO REPLACE THE ENGINE IN A CAR THAT IS THREE YEARS OLD.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS.  I FOUND ONE OTHER COMPLAINT ON YOUR WEBSITE OF EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION IN A 2000 COROLLA, BUT I AM SURE THERE ARE MANY MORE TOYOTA ENGINES OUT THERE WAITING TO BLOW UP.",
