I GOT IT TO A LOCAL SERVICE STATION AND THEY RAN A COMPUTER DIAGNOSTIC AND SAID IT WAS A MISFIRE IN THE #4 CYLINDER. THE SPARKPLUG WAS SMASHED. NOTHING WAS FOUND IN THE CYLINDER  SO THE SPARKPLUG WAS REPLACED AND TEMPORARILY FIXED THE PROBLEM. TWO WEEKS LATER THE SAME SHUDDER PROBLEM AND AGAIN THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. THIS TIME THE #1 CYLINDER WAS THE PROBLEM AND AGAIN WITH THE SAME SMASHED SPARKPLUG. MY MECHANIC THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY ODD OCCURRENCE AND CHECKED AND FOUND THE RECALL #3005C. MY LOCAL MAZDA DEALER THEN SAID MY VIN# DID NOT FALL WITHIN THE RANGE OF THE RECALL AND YET THERE SEEMS TO BE MANY PEOPLE WITH THIS PROBLEM. IT LOOKS LIKE MAZDA IS TRYING TO AVOID THIS PROBLEM.  *TR",
