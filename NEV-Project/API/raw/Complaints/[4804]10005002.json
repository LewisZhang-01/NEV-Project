NO REPAIR MADE.  NOW WITH 80,000 MILES ON VEHICLE, WE HAVE TAKEN IT IN AGAIN AND SHOWN THE DEALER A \"TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN\" FROM NHTSA.COM SHOWING CERTAIN 1998 VIN #'S NEED NEW FUEL TANKS.  DEALER TOLD ME MY VEHICLE DIDN'T APPLY.  TWO WEEKS LATER I RETURNED AND DROVE VEHICLE W/SERVICE MANAGER.  HE FINALLY AGREED THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH MY TANK AND WILL FIX/REPLACE. IF YOU HAVE THIS PROBLEM, SEE THE SECTION ON THIS WEB SITE THAT SHOWS TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS, PRINT MY COMPLAINT ALSO, AND TAKE THESE TO YOUR DEALER TO GET YOUR \"THUD\" FIXED.",
