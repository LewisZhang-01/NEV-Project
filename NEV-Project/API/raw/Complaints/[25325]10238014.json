THIRD FAILURE CAUSED ACCIDENT AND DAMAGE TO THE TRUCK.  FORD IS NOT RESPONSIVE TO MY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.  THE TRUCK IS DANGEROUS AND SHOULD NOT BE ON THE ROAD. WE KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER ABS FAILURES IN THE FORD PRODUCT LINE.  THE FORD FACTORY SHOULD STEP UP TO THIS PROBLEM AND SO FAR THEY HAVE NOT DONE SO.  THE DEALER WE GOT IT FROM WILL ONLY GET US INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE IF WE SPEND A LOT OF ADDITIONAL MONEY.  THAT IS NOT RIGHT EITHER.  WE NEED HELP. *TR",
