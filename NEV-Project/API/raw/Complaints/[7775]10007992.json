I WAS VERY SHOCKED SINCE CAR HAS NEVER BEEN USED TO HAUL ANYTHING MORE THAN GROCERIES. I WAS TOLD BY THE MECHANIC THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM AND THEY CHECK FOR IT. I REPORTED THIS TO FORD MOTORS AND WAS FOR THE MOST PART TOLD \"SORRY BUT NOT OUR PROBLEM\". IT APPEARS FROM THE VARIOUS DEALERS AND FORD MOTORS THAT THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM THAT THEY PLAN TO DO NOTHING ABOUT UNLESS FORCED TO BY PEOPLE BEING KILLED OR INJURED. IF THEY CANNOT OWN UP TO POOR WORKMANSHIP, THEN I WILL BE BUYING MY VEHICLES ELSEWHERE.",
