LAST NIGHT AFTER THE DEALERSHIP PUT A NEW  SET OF TIRES ON  FROM  A NEW  CAR, TO PROVE TO ME THAT IT WAS THE  TIRES. I AM NOT HAPPY! ALSO, THE  INFORMED ME  THAT  I WOULD  NEED  NEW  BRAKES...OKAY, THAT  IS POSSIBLE. HOWEVER, THEY  ALSO TOLD ME THAT I WOULD NEED NEW  ROTORS. NOTHING THAT THEY COULD BE  TURNED...JUST THAT I NEED NEW ONES.  WHEN I STILL HAVE BRAKE PADS. HOW CAN THAT BE? ARE THEY MADE OF SOFT METAL THAT THEY DON'T LAST? THAT FORD COUNTS THAT AS A WEARING PROBLEM, SO THE COST IS ON ME?",
