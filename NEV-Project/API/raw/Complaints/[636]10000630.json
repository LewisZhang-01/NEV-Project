HAD THE CAR NOT BEEN ON A SIDE STREET (AS OPPOSED TO AN EXPRESSWAY), IT COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  I'VE CONTACTED SEVERAL PONTIACE DEALERS AND GM/PONTIAC AND WAS TOLD THEY NO NOTHING OF A RECALL AND THAT I SHOULD PAY TO HAVE IT FIXED AND THEY MIGHT REIMBURSE ME IF THEY FIND OUT ABOUT A RECALL AND IF IT MEETS THEIR SPECS.  EVEN AFTER I GAVE THEM THE NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID THEY STILL SAID THEY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THIS.  HOW COULD THEY NOT???  I HEARD ABOUT IT MONTHS AGO ON THE NEWS.",
