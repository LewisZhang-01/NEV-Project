        "summary": "IN APRIL '02, WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEED, THE 2500 VAN BEGAN TO MAKE A LOUD NOISE IN THE FRONT WHEELS.  THERE WAS ALSO A LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE AND THEN A LOSS OF BRAKING ABILITY.  IT WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER WHERE HE FOUND THE WHEEL WAS COMING OFF BECAUSE THE WHEEL BEARINGS WERE DISINTEGRATED AND NO GREASE WAS THERE.  SOME PARTS OF BRAKING SYSTEM WERE ALSO DAMAGED AND IN NEED OF REPAIR.  AT OUR INSISTENCE, THE OTHER SIDE WAS CHECKED WHICH ALSO NEEDED NEW BEARINGS.  THE WHEEL BEARINGS WERE INSPECTED AND GREASED ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURES SCHEDULE IN AUG. '02.  IN JAN. OF '03, A NOISE AND GRINDING WAS HEARD IN THE FRONT END.  IT WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER WHO ONCE AGAIN REPLACED THE LEFT FRONT BEARINGS.  AT THAT TIME I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT THEY WERE SEEING THIS PROBLEM IN A LOT OF THE 2500 VANS AND THAT CHRYSLER WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND \"WORKING ON IT\".  IN MAR. OF '03, THE SAME NOISE AND GRINDING SOUND WAS HEARD, AND TAKEN TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR.  ONCE AGAIN IT WAS THE WHEEL BEARINGS.  HOWEVER, THEY ARE REFUSING TO COVER THE REPAIR UNDER THE WARRANTY THIS TIME AS THEY SAY THE CAR WAS NOT MAINTAINED ACCORDING TO THE SCHEDULE.  THE WARRANTY COMPANY SAYS THE WHEEL BEARINGS MUST BE SERVICES EVERY 9,000 MILES WHILE THE OWNERS MANUAL SAYS EVERY 15,000 MILES ON ONE SCHEDULE AND DOESN'T EVEN MENTION THEM ON THE OTHER SCHEDULE.  FIRST, I AM CONCERNED FOR THE SAFETY OF MYSELF AND MY FAMILY AS IT A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY FACTOR THAT YOUR WHEEL CAN FALL OFF WHEN THE BEARINGS FAIL.  I AM ALSO CONCERNED BECAUSE I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER  THEY WERE SEEING MANY VANS WITH THIS PROBLEM AND NOW THE WARRANTY COMPANY IS REFUSING TO PAY FOR REPAIRS BY SHIFTING THE BLAME TO THE CONSUMER.  PERHAPS THEY SHOULD INVESTIGATE THE REASON FOR THE MULTIPLE FAILURES RATHER THAN ATTEMPTING  NOT TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR. *JB",
