DEALER PICKED UP HALF THE COST.  CAR HAD ONLY 40,000 MILES.  I CALLED CADILLAC CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ALL THEY SAID THEY COULD DO WAS TO CONTACT THE DEALER WHICH I HAD ALREADY WORKED WITH.  DEALER FEELS THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THE HEADLIGHTS BECAUSE 'WE REPLACE A LOT OF THESE ON '97 & 98' DEVILLES, GRAND AM'S, AND OTHER SIMILAR PRODUCTS.  THESE ARE SEALED UNITS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SEALED UNIT THAT SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY (ORIGINAL OR EXTENDED).  IT'S CONSIDERED TRIM WHICH IS NOT RIGHT.  WHAT MAKES A SEALED HEADLAMP ANY LESS IMPORTANT THAN ANY OTHER SEALED UNIT ON THE CAR?  CERTAINLY ITS LOCATION SHOULD NOT.  IT'S JUST PLAIN A DEFECT IN MANUFACTURING AND CADILLAC SHOULD FACE IT AND MAKE IT RIGHT.*JB",
