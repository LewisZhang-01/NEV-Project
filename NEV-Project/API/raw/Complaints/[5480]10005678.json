        "summary": "WE HAVE BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS WITH OUR ABS SINCE WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE. AT TIMES THE ABS WOULD SUDDENLY ENGAGE WHEN IT WASN'T WARRANTED (I.E., IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER ON A DRY ROAD, SLOWLY APPROACHING A STOP). THEN SUDDENLY, BACKING OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY THE ABS LIGHT CAME ON, ALONG WITH THE BUZZING NOISE. THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE NOISE WAS TO PULL OUT THE FUSE TO THE ABS SYSTEM. UPON RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET, I'VE NOTICED THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM AMONG OTHER 1999 CHEVY SILVERADO OWNERS. SOMETHING IS OBVIOUSLY WRONG WITH THE ABS SYSTEM IN THESE MODELS. GENERAL MOTORS WON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  THE UNIT COSTS $1000 TO FIX, WHICH BY THE TIME THE DEFECT USUALLY SHOWS UP, WARRANTIES DON'T COVER. MY GUESS IS THAT BY THE TIME SOMEONE TAKES THIS PROBLEM SERIOUSLY ENOUGH TO TAKE A LOOK INTO THIS AND REALIZES THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE ABS SYSTEM IN THE 1999 CHEVY SILVERADO, THAT SOMEONE WILL HAVE GOTTEN HURT OR EVEN WORSE...A DEATH WILL OCCUR BECAUSE OF IT.",
