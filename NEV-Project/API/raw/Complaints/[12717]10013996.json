THE DEALER TELLS ME THE VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE A RESERVE, BUT A 7 GALLON RESERVE DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. I PREVIOUSLY OWNED A 1999 F-250 WITH THE SAME SPECS AND WHEN THE FUEL GAUGE READ EMPTY IT WOULD TAKE UP TO 29 GALLONS, I HAD THE 2002 VEHICLE AT THE DEALER 3 TIMES FOR THIS PROBLEM, THEY ALSO TELL ME THE GAUGE IS WORKING PROPERLY.  *JB",
