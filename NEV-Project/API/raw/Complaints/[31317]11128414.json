AFTER PARKING THE VEHICLE IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE FRONT RIGHT TIRE HAD COMPLETELY DEFLATED.  BUT HE TPMS DID NOT SHOW ANY ABNORMALITY EVER DURING THE DRIVE.  THE TIRE WAS DAMAGED TO AN EXTENT THAT IT HAD TO BE REPLACED.  THANKFULLY THIS HAPPENED AT A LOW SPEED AND IT APPEARS THAT THE TPMS SENSORS (ON WHICH THERE WAS AN EARLIER RECALL) IS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY.",
