IT JUST WONT SHIFT INTO FIRST GEAR YOU CAN BE THERE FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES TRYING TO PUT IT IN FIRST GEAR, AND THIS CAUSES A TRAFFIC JAM BEHIND ME. I'M NOT SURE IF ITS THE GEAR BOX OR THE CLUTCH, BUT ITS VERY FRUSTRATING.  THIS IS A 2001 TRUCK AND I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE HAVING A PROBLEM YET.  MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER 2001 DODGE DAKOTA WITH THE SAME PROBLEM LIKE THIS.   *NLM",
