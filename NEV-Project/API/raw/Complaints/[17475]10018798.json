AT THE TIME, THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS BACKLOG AND WE WERE TOLD TO WAIT; THAT THE PROBLEM WOULDN'T AFFECT US UNTIL THE TIRES WERE 3 OR MORE YEARS OLD. AFTER WAITING FOR 2 YEARS, WE TRIED AGAIN TO GET THE TIRES REPLACED, BUT WERE INFORMED THAT FORD WOULD NOT HELP US IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER--WE HAD MISSED THEIR DEADLINE (WHICH WAS NEVER MENTIONED IN THE ORIGINAL MATERIALS AND WHICH IS NOT MENTIONED IN ANY WEB-SITE OR NHTSA ANNOUNCEMENT WE COULD FIND). DURING A RECENT TRIP FROM ATLANTA TO FLORIDA, WE WERE FLAGGED TO PULL OVER BY ANOTHER MOTORIST WHO NOTICED THAT OUR LEFT-REAR TIRE WAS SMOKING. WE WERE ABLE TO PULL OFF IN TIME TO REPLACE IT WITH THE SPARE WITHOUT ROLLING THE VEHICLE OR OTHERWISE ENDING UP DEAD. NOW WE ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW TO GET THE REMAINING TIRES REPLACED. PLEASE HELP.  *NLM",
