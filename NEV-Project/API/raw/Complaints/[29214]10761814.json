        "summary": "WHEN DRIVING OUT OF A HOSPITAL PARKING STRUCTURE, WHEN COMING TO THE EXIT ON THE LOWEST LEVEL YOU MUST MAKE A SHARP RIGHT TURN INTO THE EXIT BOOTH LANE. WHEN TURNING RIGHT, IT WAS AS IF A \"TOOTH\" INSIDE THE STEERING GEAR BROKE OFF CAUSING A COLLISION WITH THE RAIL WHILE EXITING THE PARKING STRUCTURE. NOW THE STEERING HAS AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF PLAY AND WHILE IN THE CENTER OF THE (STEERING PLAY) IT IS AS IT BINDS OR STICKS AT TIMES WHERE THE \"TOOTH\" USED TO BE ON THE STEERING GEAR. IT HAS BECOME QUITE DANGEROUS TO DRIVE, ESPECIALLY AT HIGH SPEEDS OR ON THE INTERSTATE AS THE VEHICLE TENDS TO WANDER NOW AND FOLLOW THE CRACKS IN THE ROAD. I HAVE OWNED DODGE RAM PICKUPS FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS SINCE I BOUGHT MY FIRST BRAND NEW RAM PICKUP AND LET ME TELL YOU, THEY HAVE ALL HAD ISSUES WITH LOOSE STEERING BOXES, EVEN THE NEW ONE. BUT WHEN THEY BREAK, THAT IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT PEOPLE CANNOT SEE COMING WITH A NORMAL INSPECTION AS ON THE OUTSIDE, WEAR IS UNDETECTABLE. I HAVE BEEN AN ASE CERTIFIED TECHNICIAN THE BETTER PART OF MY ADULT LIFE AND THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I AM SURE CHRYSLER HAS INVESTIGATED THIS ISSUE ALREADY AND FOUND THAT IT WOULD JUST COST TOO MUCH TO RECALL ALL THESE VEHICLES TO REPAIR THEM BUT THE LEAST THEY COULD DO IS SELL A PART PRICED AT COST TO SHARE THE BURDEN WITH THE CONSUMER. IT MAY SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE",
