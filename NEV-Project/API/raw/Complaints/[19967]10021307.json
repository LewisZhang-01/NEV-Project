        "summary": "2000 FORD FOCUS FUEL PUMP PROBLEMS. I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT FORD NEEDS TO RECALL. THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVING TO PAY RIDICULOUS AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO FIX THIS IS STUPID. I KNOW THAT FORD IS A BETTER COMPANY THAN THIS AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY NEED TO SHOW THEIR TRUE COLORS AND STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND RECALL THIS PART ON THE FOCUSES. IT'S ALSO A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AS WELL. THE CAR WILL JUST DIE WHEN YOU ROUND A CORNER. I DON'T THINK THAT'S EXACTLY SAFE.  I CAN'T SEE PAYING ALMOST 500.00 TO HAVE SOMETHING REPLACED THAT'S HAPPENING ON SO MANY CARS. I COULD SEE PAYING THAT MONEY IF IT WAS A SCARCE PROBLEM, BUT IT'S NOT. EVERY FOCUS OWNER THAT I KNOW HAS HAD TO REPLACE THE FUEL PUMP AT LEAST ONCE. SOME HAVE HAD TO DO IT 2 OR 3 TIMES. THIS NEEDS TO BE A RECALL AND FORD KNOWS IT.  *JB",
