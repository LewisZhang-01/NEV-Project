SINCE THIS OCCURRENCE THIS SITUATION HAS HAPPENED INTERMITTENTLY FOR THE PAST YEAR. I HAVE BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO THE FORD DEALER AND 2 DIFFERENT MECHANICS, ALL OF WHOM HAVE CHANGED MANY DIFFERENT ITEMS RANGING FROM A TUNE UP TO A NEW COIL AND MULTIPLE CAM SHAFT SENSORS. ALL 3 HAVE PERFORMED MANY DIAGNOSTICS BUT TO DATE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO LOCATE THE PROBLEM WHICH STILL EXISTS BUT WITH MORE REGULARITY. I AM NO LONGER ABLE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE DUE TO ITS PERFORMANCE AND I AM SCARED TO PUT MY WIFE AND CHILDREN IN THE VEHICLE. WHEN I DID DO SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET I CAME ACROSS HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF THE VERY SAME COMPLAINTS, SOMEONE HAS TO FORCE FORD TO ADDRESS THIS SAFETY ISSUE. MINI VANS ARE MOST COMMONLY USED FOR TRANSPORTING OUR MOST PRECIOUS PASSENGERS, CHILDREN. WILL IT TAKE A CAR FULL OF CHILDREN DYING FOR FORD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS PROBLEM EXISTS AND THAT THEY NEED TO DO THE RIGHT THING.  *TR",
