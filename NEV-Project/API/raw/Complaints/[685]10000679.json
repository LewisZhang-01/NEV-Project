        "summary": "TRANSMISSION FAILURE - WHEN PLACED INTO DRIVE THE GEARS FAILED TO ENGAGE (ESPECIALLY WHEN COLD).  THIS VAN IS 2+YEARS OLD WITH ~62,000 MILES.  FIXED AT SMITH BROTHERS IN OLD SAYBROOK, CT AND REQUIRED NEW PART DUE TO THE FAILURE OF THE CLUTCH HUB IMPUT WHICH BROKE DOWN SENDING METAL PARTS THROUGHOUT THE TRANSMISSION. (VERY EXPENSIVE FOR A CAR THIS NEW!). I CAUGHT THIS PROBLEM EARLY ENOUGH TO AVOID THE POTENTIAL DISASTER OF A HIGH SPEED FAILURE.  IN ADDITION, THIS VEHICLE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN IT'S FRONT END ALIGNMENT.  SINCE PURCHASE THE FRONT END HAS BEEN ALIGNED TWICE.  ON 12/20/00 THE FRONT 2 TIRES HAD TO BE REPLACED ANT THE FRONT END ALIGNED (NATIONAL TIRE, NIANTIC CT). THIS PAST SUMMER (I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT DATE HANDY) THE FRONT END HAD TO BE REALIGNED AGAIN AND I WAS TOLD THAT THE DRIVER SIDE WAS WAY OUT (AUTO SERVICE OF OLD SAYBROOK, 4 JADE COURT, OLD SAYBROOK, CT). THIS ISSUE HAS CAUSED EXCESSIVE TIRE WEAR BUT DANGER WAS MINIMIZED DUE TO REGULAR INSPECTION.",
