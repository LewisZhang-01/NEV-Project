TRUCK WILL BOTTOM OUT ON SLIGHT BUMPS, AND BOUNCE UP AND DOWN AS IF YOU WERE IN A BOAT, THE SUSPENSION PARTS ARE INFERIOR COMPARED TO THE WEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE. CONDITION IS VERY UNSAFE AND COULD CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL IN CERTAIN DRIVING SITUATIONS. BOUNCE = LOSS OF TREAD CONTACT TO PAVEMENT = LOSS OF CONTROL. ALL TIRES/POINTS OF SUPENSION (SPRINGS/SHOCKS) HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS VEHICLE TO ANYONE OTHER THAN A PIRATE, AS THEY ARE USED TO THE HEAVING AND YAWING OF A SHIP.-----------CATALITIC CONVERTER / ENGINE ~ CATALITIC CONVERTER WAS GLOWING RED ONE DAY (WITH THE USUAL CHECK ENGINE LIGHT) JIFFYLUBE EMPLOYEE IN THE PIT POINTED THIS PROBLEM OUT TO ME, LAUGHING AND SAYING IT WAS RIGHT NEXT TO THE GAS LINE, WHICH COULD CAUSE A FIRE. DEALER REPLACED CAT AND NOW THE TRUCH HESITATES/SPUTTERS IN FIRST GEAR AND EVEN MORE SO IN SECOND GEAR.----------------SEATBELT~ON PASSENDER SIDE BINDS UP WITHOUT PROVOCATION, LIMITING MOVEMENT OF PASSENGER FROM THE SHOLDER, DEALER SAID IT WAS NORMAL BUT IT IS NOT LIKE THE DRIVERS SIDE SEATBELT TENSION THAT BINDS WHEN THERE IS ACTUALY A STRONGER FORCE OPPOSING IT.",
