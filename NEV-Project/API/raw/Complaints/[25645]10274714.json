THE PLASTIC PART ON THE BUCKLES THAT MAKES THE BELT STAY TIGHT FOR A CAR SEAT HAS CRACKED ON ONE AND TOTALLY BROKEN OFF ON THE OTHER.  I DO NOT FEEL SAFE PUTTING MY CHILD IN THE SEAT DUE TO THE BELT NOT TIGHTENING.  THE DEALER ASSURED ME THAT THE BELT IS STILL SAFE FOR A CHILD THAT IS NOT IN A CARSEAT, BUT I DO NOT FEEL IT IS SAFE.  I HAVE NOT GOTTEN IT FIXED YET DUE TO FUNDS BEING AVAILABLE WE JUST USE THE OTHER SEATS.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS.  THEY SHOULD RECALL VEHICLES THAT DO NOT HAVE SAFETY BELTS THAT HOLD UP TO DAILY USE. *TR",
