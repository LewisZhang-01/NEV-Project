I DROVE TO MY DEALERSHIP AND THEY GAVE ME A NEW TIRE, AND SAID ALL OF THESE TRUCKS CAME WITH A 16 INCH SPARE. I NOW HAVE 30,000 MILES AND NOW NEED ALL NEW TIRES. I USUALLY GET NEW TIRES ABOUT EVERY 60,000 MILES. I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP TO ASK WHY MY TIRES WERE WEARING SO BAD AND THEY WERE NOT WILLING TO HELP OR DISCUSS THIS ISSUE.*JB",
