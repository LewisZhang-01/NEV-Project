BOTH THE RADIO AND BLUE TOOTH CAPABILITIES WERE DISABLED. RESTARTING THE CAR WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO UPDATE THE SYNC/RADIO, BUT HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL. AS PER THE FORD SYNC WEB SITE, I USED WELL ABOVE THE MINIMUMS STORAGE (2GB) AND HAD A PROPERLY FORMATTED USB DEVICE, BUT THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE THE DEVICE FOR AN UPDATE. YESTERDAY THE RADIO COMPLETELY STOPPED WORKING AND WOULD CONTINUE TO HISS AND CRACK, EVEN WITH THE CAR TURNED OFF AND KEYS OUT OF THE IGNITION. I HAVE TRIED TO RESET THE RADIO, BUT IT IS STILL NOT FUNCTIONING AND HAVE NO BLUE TOOTH CAPABILITY.",
