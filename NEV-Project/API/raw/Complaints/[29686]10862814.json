NOW BOTH ARE MALFUNCTIONING CAUSING INTERIOR LIGHTS TO STAY ON AND CHIME TO TELL ME TO PUT VEHICLE IN PARK AT ANY TIME. THIS ALSO CAUSES THE DOORS TO AUTOMATICALLY STAY UNLOCKED WHILE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION (CLEARLY A SAFETY ISSUE). I HAVE CONTACTED THE DEALER WITH A LIST OF HOW OFTEN THIS HAPPENS AS SEEN HERE ONLINE BUT THEY SAY THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS ISSUE BUT WILL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO CHARGE ME $109.00 PER HOUR TO DIAGNOSE THE ISSUE.",
