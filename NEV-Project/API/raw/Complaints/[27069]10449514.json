        "summary": "DURING BRAKING FROM 35MPH TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN MY BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR. THE TRUCK DID NOT SLOW DOWN ENOUGH TO MAKE THE TURN, I DROVE DOWN A BLOCK TO THE NEXT INTERSECTION AND USED MY PARKING BRAKE TO COMPLETE MY STOP. I PARKED THE TRUCK AND IMMEDIATELY NOTICED FLUID FROM THE BRAKE LINE LEAKING OUT ON GROUND IN THE AREA JUST BELOW WHERE THE DRIVERS FEET ARE. THE LINE IS A RIGID STEEL LINE IN A GROUP WITH 3 OTHERS THAT RUN FROM THE ABS CONTROL UNIT FORWARD AND ALL OF THESE STEEL LINES ARE SEVERELY CORRODED PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OUTSIDE OF THE FRAME WHERE THE LINE HAS RUPTURED. MY TRUCK IS A CHEVROLET 1500 Z71 WITH 126,000 MILES AND HAS BEEN WELL MAINTAINED SINCE I HAVE OWNED IT. I FEEL THAT THIS ISSUE IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND HAVE FOUND THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHERS WITH RUSTED AND RUPTURED BRAKES ON THEIR CHEVY TRUCKS. OTHER PEOPLE WERE NOT AS FORTUNATE AS ME BECAUSE MY SON AND I MADE IT HOME AND WE WERE UNHARMED. I FEEL THAT IT IS IMPERATIVE EVERYONE WHO OWNS A CHEVY TRUCK OF SIMILAR MODEL YEAR BE ALERTED AND WARNED OF THIS POTENTIALLY DEADLY AND DANGEROUS BRAKE PROBLEM.  *TR",
