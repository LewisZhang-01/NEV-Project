I APPROACHED THE DEALERSHIP IN SUMMER 2000 ABOUT GOING TO ARBITRATION RE: HAVING VEHICLE REPLACED, AND THEY REFUSED TO PROVIDE THE AREA REPRESENTATIVELY NAME AND NUMBER.  I GOT IT ANYWAY AND FILED A COMPLAINT.  DEALER PROMISED TO RECTIFY ALL ISSUES, AND REPAIRED SEVERAL PROBLEMS, WHICH HAVE ALL RECURRED (AND WORSE) SINCE THE WARRANTY EXPIRED.  PROBLEMS HAVE INCLUDED ELECTRICAL, FUSE MALFUNCTIONS (WINDOWS, LOCKS, CD PLAYER, SUNROOF), AIR CONDITIONER LEAKAGE, ENGINE STALLING, ENGINE OVERHEATING, TRUNK LEAKING, ETC.   NOW ENGINE HAS COMPLETELY FROZEN.  I HAVE TAKEN GOOD CARE OF THIS CAR, WITH REGULAR MAINTENANCE AND WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER GM PRODUCT AGAIN. *JB",
