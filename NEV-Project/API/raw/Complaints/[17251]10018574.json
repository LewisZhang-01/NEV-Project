I DON'T FEEL THAT THE GASKET SHOULD HAVE FAILED SO SOON. THE SERVICE DEPT. AT OLDS TELLS ME THAT THEIR ARE GASKET PROBLEMS WITH 3.1L AS WELL AS 3.8L, WHICH IS WHAT I HAVE.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THIS SAME ISSUE, AND WHAT IS BEING DONE, OR IS MY PROBLEM NORMAL. PLEASE RESPOND ASAP.
