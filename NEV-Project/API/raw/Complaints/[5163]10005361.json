DOOR CAN BE CLOSED WITH FINGER PRESSURE AGAINST THE DOOR. ON A SLIGHT DECLINE, DOOR WILL UNLATCH FROM ITS LOCKED OPEN POSITION AND SLAM SHUT. I HAVE TO HAVE SOMEONE HOLD IT OPEN DURING ENTRY AND EXITING ON A DRIVEWAY WITH A SLIGHT DECLINE. THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE DESIGN HAS CHANGED AND IT DOES NOT LOCK LIKE THE OLDER ASTRO'S. SOMEONE NOT AWARE OF THIS WILL HAVE A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY AND IT COULD SLAM SHUT ON SOMEONE ENTERING OR EXITING THE VEHICLE. THIS IS DEFINITELY A SAFTEY ISSUE. SOMEONE MUST LOOK INTO THIS AND GET GM TO CREATE A SB TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.   WHAT IS THE MAXIMUM ANGLE OR PRESSURE REQUIRED FOR THE DOOR TO STAY LOCKED IN THE OPEN POSITION?",
