        "summary": "I HAVE TWO INTERMITTENT ISSUES WITH MY 2001 FORD EXPEDITION EDDIE BAUER.  1.  ON 4 OCCASIONS THE VEHICLE HAS SURGED FORWARD.  THIS HAS HAPPENED TWICE AT 5 MPH, 50 MPH, AND 15 MPH.  THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS NOT ON.  AT THE SLOWER SPEEDS I WAS EITHER SLOWING DOWN OR COASTING AND THE RMP RAPIDLY INCREASED FOR ABOUT 2 SECONDS AND THEN SLOWED DOWN.(FROM 1100 RPMS UP TO 2200 RPMS)  AT THE HIGHER SPEED, IT FELT LIKE SOMEONE RAN INTO THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE.  IT TOOK OFF FOR A SIMILAR TIME AND THEN RETURNED TO THE PRIOR RPMS.  I TOOK IT TO A BLUE OVAL CERTIFIED DEALER AND WAS TOLD NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH VEHICLE.  2.  EITHER WHILE STOPPING OR ACCELERATING, THE RADIO VOLUME WILL TURN ITSELF WAY UP FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS.  IT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF YOU.  THIS HAPPENS ABOUT ONCE A MONTH.  THE FIRST ISSUE IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AS I NARROWLY MISSED REAR-ENDING A VEHICLE ONE TIME AND A MAILBOX ANOTHER.  THE SECOND ISSUE IS MORE OF A NUISANCE THAN A SAFETY ISSUE.  BOTH APPEAR TO BE ELECTRICAL/COMPUTER ISSUES.*JB",
