        "summary": "THE PROBLEM :  UNDER INFLATED TIRES CAUSE TIRE FAILURE, ACCIDENTS, INJURIES, DEATHS, AND INCREASES BOTH TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND AIR POLLUTION  (AS A RESULT OF ACCIDENTS AND TRAFFIC TIE-UPS)   ELEMENTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROBLEM :   TIRES MANUFACTURERS PRINT INFLATION INSTRUCTIONS ON THE SIDEWALL OF THE TIRE THAT ARE WAY TOO SMALL FOR AN AGING POPULATION TO FIND OR READ.   TRUST ME. I'M OVER 40 AND I HAVE ONE HECK OF A TIME FINDING THE RIGHT TIRE INFLATION (PSI) RATING.  I'D REALLY LIKE TO OPERATE MY CAR SAFELY. BUT,  DARN IT - IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO FIND THE CORRECT PRESSURE ON THE TIRES FOR PROPER INFLATION. YES SIR, I'M AWARE THE SAME DATA MAY BE ON THE CAR DOOR. BUT, I'M A BELIEVER THAT STUFF CAN SOMETIMES GET SCREWED UP AND I'D RATHER FOLLOW THE GUIDELINES FOR THE TIRES THAT REALLY ARE ON MY CAR.  THE SOLUTION: REQUIRE TIRE MANUFACTURERS TO PRINT TIRE INFLATION INFORMATION  PROMINENTLY  ON THE TIRE IN LETTERS OF A SIZE  (FONT)  BIG ENOUGH TO READ  (WITHOUT TAKING OFF YOUR GLASSES OR GOING TO LOOK FOR READING GLASSES.)   ADVANTAGES:  THIS WOULD SAVE LIVES, REDUCE INJURIES, REDUCE PROPERTY DAMAGE ACCIDENTS, REDUCE HIGHWAY CONGESTION (DUE TO ACCIDENTS & VEHICLE BREAKDOWNS) . ALL OF THE PRECEDING WOULD ALSO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION, AND THEREFORE CREATE A MORE HEALTHY  AND LESS STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL OF US.  COST:  NOW, THE IDEA WOULD SAVE MILLIONS - IF NOT BILLIONS PER YEAR. (JUST CONSIDER THE COST OF TRAFFIC CONGESTION ALONE WITH ACCIDENTS.) YET, IT SHOULDN'T COST A DIME TO IMPLEMENT OVER TIME.  (WE REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR A MILLION DOLLAR STUDY TO TELL  US THAT WHICH SEEMS PRETTY  INTUITIVE.)   WHAT DO YOU THINK  MR. SECRETARY?   WOULD YOU OR ONE OF YOUR STAFFERS LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS SUGGESTION?  I AM  EARNEST IN FORWARDING IT BECAUSE I REALLY THINK IT WOULD HELP OUR NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM .  THANK YOU  FOR TAKING TIME TO READ MY LETTER AND CONSIDER THIS MATTER.    RESPECTFULLY,    RICH WEIRICH.*JB",
