THE HEADLIGHTS ON MY 1997 PONTIAC GRAND PRIX HAVE MOISTURE THAT FORMS ON THE INSIDE OF THE HEADLIGHT MAKING THE ENTIRE INSIDE OF THE HEADLIGHT TURN BLACK. MAKES IT VERY HARD TO SEE AT NIGHT! THE ONLY SOLUTION I SEE IS AN EXPENSIVE REPLACEMENT OF THE ENTIRE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY WITH NO GUARANTEE THAT IT WILL NOT DO IT AGAIN. THIS IS A LOW MILE CAR (LESS THAN 30,000 MILES) AND SPENDS NIGHTS INSIDE THE GARAGE! THIS STARTED WHEN THE CAR WAS PROBABLY ONLY A YEAR & A HALF OLD ON THE ONE LENS BUT NOW BOTH ARE THAT WAY.  *JB",
