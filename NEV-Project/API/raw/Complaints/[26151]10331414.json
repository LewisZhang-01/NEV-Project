        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING MY DAD'S 2006 CHEVROLET EQUINOX, IT SUDDENLY STARTED VIBRATING RATHER BADLY AT ABOUT 45-50 MPH. I CHECKED THE VEHICLE OUT, AND FOUND THAT THE CARRIER BEARING HAD RUSTED APART, AND BASICALLY WAS DOING NOTHING. THE VEHICLE ONLY HAD 23,750 MILES ON IT, BUT IS OUT OF WARRANTY DUE TO AGE. TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE WAS ALMOST $500. I HAVE READ DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SAME PROBLEM FROM CONSUMERS THAT FEEL THE SAME AS I DO. GENERAL MOTORS KNOWS THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM CONCERNING THIS AND THEY WILL DO NOTHING TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEM. THEY PUT A DEFECTIVE POORLY MADE PART ON THIS VEHICLE AND IT NEEDS TO BE COVERED UNDER A RECALL. A FAILURE OF THIS BEARING AT 70 MPH PROBABLY WOULD HAVE CAUSED A DRIVE SHAFT FAILURE {SEPARATION}, WHICH COULD LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT. I SINCERELY HOPE THAT GM CAN BE MADE ACCOUNTABLE IN THIS INSTANCE, BECAUSE THEY ARE RIPPING THE PUBLIC OFF WITH THEIR INFERIOR CRAFTSMANSHIP. *TR",
