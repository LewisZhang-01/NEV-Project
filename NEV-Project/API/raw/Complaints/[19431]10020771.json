        "summary": "REGARDING THE NEW BODY STYLE DODGE 1500 RAM PICKUP. MY TRUCK IS LESS THAN A YEAR OLD AND ABOUT 15000 MILES. IT HAS A STEERING PROBLEM. GENERALLY, IT PULLS TO THE RIGHT, DANGEROUSLY! THE SECOND DAY OF MY OWNERSHIP, WENT TO THE DEALER AND THEY ALIGNED IT. TOLD ME IF I STILL HAD A PROBLEM, IT WAS A TIRE PROBLEM. THE ALIGNMENT DID NOT HELP. I HAD THE TIRES ROTATED AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND THIS DID NOT HELP. THE STEERING PROBLEM IS WORSE NOW. IF I TRAVEL OVER A BUMP OR A SEAM IN THE ROAD, THE VEHICLE WILL VERE TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT OR BOTH DIRECTIONS IN AN UNCONTROLABLE AND VIOLENT MANNER. I MUST COME TO A COMPLETE STOP TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. YES, IT IS VERY SCARY. SO MUCH SO, THAT I AGAIN RETURNED TO THE DEALER, THEY ALIGNED IT AGAIN. THE PROBLEM SEEMS WORSE NOW. I WAS TOLD, IF THE ALIGNMENT DID NOT HELP TO BRING IT BACK AND THEY WOULD ORDER/INSTAL A NEW RACK. I DID SO AND WAS PUT OFF. TODAY, 5-30-03 I RETURNED TO THE DEALER TO ASK ABOUT THE FIX FOR MY STEERING PROBLEM. I AGAIN WAS PUT OFF AND I ASKED TO CALL CHRYSLER. I DID, THE NICE AND EFFICIENT LADY NEW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT WITH THE STEERING PROBLEM. I ASKED IF THERE WERE ALOT OF COMPLAINTS LIKE MINE AND WITHOUT SAYING \"YES\", SHE INDICATED THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS. WHILE ON HOLD WITH HER, SHE CALLED MY DEALER. I LATER CALLED THE DEALER AS INSTRUCTED. THE SERVICE ADVISOR I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH FOR THREE WEEKS SAID \"THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING, CHRYSLER IS AWARE AND HAS RE-DESIGNED PARTS FOR THE FIX, HOWEVER THEY ARE NOT YET AVAILABLE.\"  I AM TO TAKE MY TRUCK IN ON MONDAY, 6-2-03  FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS SO THEY CAN \"LOOK AT IT AGAIN.\"  SAD TO SAY, BUT I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE MY NEW DODGE TRUCK. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT WILL VERE VIOLENTLY OUT OF CONTROL. WHAT DOES A CONSUMER DO? HOW LONG BEFORE PARTS ARE AVAILABLE? HOW MANY PEOPLE MUST DIE OR THEIR LIVES CHANGED FOREVER BEFORE THE PROBLEM IS ADDRESSED ON A LARGE SCALE?*AK",
