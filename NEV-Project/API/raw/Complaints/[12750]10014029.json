THE CAR COASTED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, AND RESISTED ALL ATTEMPTS TO BE RESTARTED.  THE TOW TRUCK TOOK THE 2000 XTERRA TO THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP.  THE DEALER SAID THE INTERNAL FUEL SENDING UNIT, LOCATED IN THE GAS TANK, WAS CORRODED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  LUCKILY NO ONE GOT HURT.  THE  VEHICLE ONLY HAS 65,412 MILES ON IT AND IS UNDER WARRANTY.  OUR DEDUCTIBLE WAS $50 PLUS $3 TAX.  IT IS DISTURBING TO SEE HOW MANY OTHERS HAVE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM, BUT THERE HAS BEEN NO RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM.   THE NHTSA SHOWS MANY COMPLAINTS FOR THIS SIMILAR PROBLEM.  IT APPEARS THAT A RECALL WOULD BE JUSTIFIED!  I WOULD BE SADDENED TO HEAR THAT SOMEONE DIED DUE TO THIS ISSUE.  *JB",
