THEY TOLD ME (IN SO MANY WORDS) THAT IT IS MY PROBLEM NOT THEIRS. OBVIOUSLY, THEY HAVE MY MONEY NOW AND ARE NO LONGER CONCERNED WITH MY RETURNING AS A CUSTOMER.    SO THIS IS HOW THE \"NEW DODGE\" IS IMPROVING THE COMPANY??? IF THEY DO NOT STEP-UP TO THE PLATE AND DO THE HONORABLE THING, SHAME ON THEM. THEIR REPUTATION WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD THUS THEY WILL CERTAINLY PAY FOR THEIR SHAMEFUL METHODS IN THE END.    REGARDS,  JOSH  *TR",
