IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE THE CAR IS RUNNING ON DAY LIGHTS ONLY, EVEN THOUGH THE LOW BEAMS ARE ON. IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND NEEDS TO BE REMEDIED ASAP. I HAVE HAD THE BULBS TESTED AND THE MECHANIC SAYS THEY ARE FINE. IT IS JUST THE WAY THEY ARE PLACED IN THE VEHICLE. I AM TERRIFIED TO DRIVE AT NIGHT, BUT THIS IS MY ONLY VEHICLE AND I DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO REPLACE IT RIGHT NOW.",
