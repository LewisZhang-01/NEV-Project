ACCORDING TO INTERNET THERE OVER 400,000 COMPLAINTS. CALLED TOYOTA AND WAS TOLD THERE IS A TECHNICAL BULLETIN ON THE PROBLEM AND IT REQUIRES REPLACING STEERING SHAFT. I ALSO READ ON THE INTERNET THAT VEHICLES WHO REPLACED THE INTERMEDIATE STEERING SHAFT OFTEN HAVE TO REPLACE IT AGAIN. THIS SEEMS TO ME THAT TOYOTA CAN NOT FIX THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM AND NOW IT BECOMES THE OWNERS RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP ON CHANGING AN INTRICATE PART TO DRIVING THEIR VEHICLES. WHY WITH SO MANY FAILURES HASN'T YOUR AGENCY WARNED THE PUBLIC OR IS NHTSA SAYING THERE IS NO ISSUE OR SAFETY CONCERN. PLEASE INFORM ME THAT THIS ISSUE IS NOT A PROBLEM AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT AND I DON'T HAVE TO SPEND $800.00 TO FIX IT.",
