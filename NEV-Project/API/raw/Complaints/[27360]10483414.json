THE L01 RECALL WAS PERFORMED AT DODGE DEALERSHIP IN DAYTONA AUTO MALL, DAYTONA BEACH FLORIDA WHERE THE VEHICLE WAS ORIGINALLY PURCHASED. ACCORDING TO THE PROCEDURE TO REPLACE THE ORC, THE ELECTRONIC STABILITY DYNAMIC SENSOR (ESP) HAD TO BE REMOVED AND RE-INSTALLED AS PART OF THE REPLACEMENT FOR THE ORC. VEHICLE WAS PICKED UP AND DRIVEN HOME THAT DAY. THE NEXT DAY THE VEHICLE WAS STARTED AND THE ESP, BAKE ASSIST SENSOR (BAS), AND TRACTION CONTROL SENSOR LIGHTS APPEARED ON THE DASH. RETURNED VEHICLE TO DODGE DEALER TO VERIFY THAT THIS WAS NOT CAUSED BY THE RECALL PROCEDURE. DODGE DEALER CHECKED ABS CODES AND SAID THE STEERING ANGLE CONTROL /CLOCK SPRING SENSOR WAS DEFECTIVE, AND WOULD COST $500 PLUS TO FIX. ALL THESE COMPONENTS ARE CONNECTED TO THE ABS SYSTEM. I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE THAT ONE DAY AFTER THE L01 RECALL WAS DONE, THAT ANOTHER COMPONENT OF THE ABS SYSTEM FAILED.  *TR",
