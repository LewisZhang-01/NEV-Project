THE BRAKES COULD NOT CONTROL IT.  THE FIRST TIME I PUT IT IN NEUTRAL AND THE ENGINE REVERTED TO IDLE SPEED AND I WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE NORMALLY.  A FEW MILES LATER IT DID IT AGAIN AS I WAS COMING TO A STOP IN HEAVY TRAFFIC.  THIS TIME WHEN I PUT IT IN NEUTRAL THE ENGINE RACED AT FULL SPEED AS IF IT WAS BEING FLOORED.  I HAD TO TURN OFF THE KEY.  WHEN I RESTARTED THE ENGINE IT RAN FINE FOR A FEW MILES UNTIL I WAS EXITING THE HIGHWAY.  AGAIN WHEN I SLOWED TO A STOP THE ENGINE RACED AT FULL REVS.  GOING INTO NEUTRAL DID NOT HELP.  TURNING OFF THE KEY FIXED IT.  AT THE END OF THE DAY AFTER WORK THE VEHICLE BEHAVED NORMALLY.   THIS JEEP HAS DONE THIS 3 TIMES IN THE PAST, IN JANUARY 2009, FEB 2012 AND OCTOBER 2014.  *TR",
