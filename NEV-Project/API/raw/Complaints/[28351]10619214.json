        "summary": "MY 2011 F150 IS EQUIPPED WITH THE ECOBOOST ENGINE AND HAS HAD PROBLEMS SINCE NEW.  DURING LONG DRIVES WHEN IT IS WET OUT THE TRUCK LOSES POWER, STUMBLES AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON.  ON ONE OCCASION I WAS MAKING A PASS AND THE PROBLEM OCCURRED, CREATING A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION DUE TO EXTREME LOSS OF POWER.  AFTER A MINUTE OR SO IT SEEMS TO RE-SET BUT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STAYS ON AND FUEL ECONOMY IS POOR.  I HAVE HAD MY TRUCK BACK TO FORD AT LEAST 4 TIMES FOR THIS ISSUE AND EVERY TIME I GET A DIFFERENT STORY.  I THINK THIS ISSUE EFFECTS A LOT MORE F150'S THAN REPORTED SINCE THE VEHICLE NEEDS TO BE DRIVEN A LONG TIME IN WET CONDITIONS AND THEN THE PROBLEM WILL OCCUR UNDER HARD ACCELERATION.   FORDS HAS TOLD ME MANY SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM FROM A BAD COIL, CATALYTIC CONVERTER, INTERCOOLER, AIR COOLER ECT. ECT.  I GET A DIFFERENT STORY EVERY TIME I TAKE IT BACK.  MY BIG PROBLEM IS MY TRUCK NOW HAS 47000 MILES ON IT AND OUT OF WARRANTY.   *TR",
