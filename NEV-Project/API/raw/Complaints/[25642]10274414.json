        "summary": "AFTER ARRIVING HOME, I PULLED INTO GARAGE AND NOTICED AN ODOR OF BURNING OIL.  UPON EXITING THE CAR, I SAW A TRAIL OF OIL FROM THE BACK OF THE CAR UP MY DRIVEWAY, EXTENDING UP TO THE STREET. LOOKING UNDER THE CAR, I NOTICED OIL DRIPPING FROM THE ENGINE AREA. I FOUND THAT I LOST ALL ENGINE OIL WITHOUT ANY WARNING LIGHTS OR SOUNDS ADVISING ME OF THE PROBLEM. FORTUNATELY THE LOSS OF OIL ONLY OCCURRED IN MY DRIVEWAY AND GARAGE AREA.  MY CAR HAD TO BE TOWED TO DEALER. THEY INSTALLED SEVERAL GASKETS, A TIMING CHAIN COVER, A FIPG OIL PAN, A BELT (V-RIBBED), NON-CHLOR BRAKE C, A REPLACEABLE ELEME, ANOTHER GASKET, A PIPE SUB-ASSY, 0I. SINCE OIL WAS SPRAYED IN ENGINE AREA, THEY HAD TO WASH ENGINE OFF.  UPON RESEARCHING THIS OIL LOSS PROBLEM, I FIND MANY OTHER 2006 TOYOTA AVALONS HAVE EXPERIENCED EXACTLY THE SAME THING.  IF I HAD BEEN DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE, I AM SURE MY ENGINE WOULD HAVE QUIT ON ME WITH NO WARNING AND COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A BAD ACCIDENT NOT TO MENTION THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ENGINE ITSELF. *TR",
