VW (AND AUDI) WILL ONLY REPLACE COILS WHEN THEY INDIVIDUALLY BURN OUT. VW/AUDI SHOULD RECALL AND REPLACE ALL COILS EITHER AT THE TIME OF BURN OUT OR BEFORE IT BECOMES AN ISSUE. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM SUGGEST THAT THE COILS ARE EITHER DEFECTIVE OR THE DESIGN OF THE VEHICLE IS FAULTY. THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS EVEN IF THE VEHICLES WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED. TS",
