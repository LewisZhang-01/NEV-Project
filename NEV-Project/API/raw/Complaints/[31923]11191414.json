IT WOULD STILL ALLOW ME TO TURN LEFT. AFTER COMING TO A STOP AND PARKING THE TRUCK, THE ISSUES RESOLVED ITSELF.     THE SECOND OCCURRENCE HAPPENED AS I WAS TAKING A LEFT TURN. I HAD COMPLETED THE LEFT TURN, AND AS THE WHEEL WAS RETURNING TO THE CENTER(TURNING BACK TO THE RIGHT), THE WHEEL LOCKED.  I WAS FORCED INTO THE NEXT LANE AND ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT. I HAD TO USE A LOT OF STRENGTH, AND I EVENTUALLY FORCED IT. WHEN IT BROKE FREE, IT MADE A LOUD POP SOUND.     THE DEALERSHIP COULD NOT FIND THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE TRUCK.",
