AS OF MARCH 5, 2003 FRONT END AND STEERING IS WORSE THAN WHEN IT WENT IN.  VERY LOOSE FEELING, FREQUENT STEERING WHEEL CORRECTION NEEDED.  VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION ESPECIALLY ON SNOW COVERED ROADS.  VERY UNSAFE FEELING.  DEALER WAS ASKED TO CHECK WORK THAT WAS PERFORMED ON NOVEMBER 0F 2002, ON JANUARY 30, 2003.  THEY DID NOT LOOK INTO THE SITUATION.    ALSO WOULD LIKE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE RADIATOR NEEDING TO BE REPLACED ALONG WITH CRANK SHAFT SEAL, LOWER PAN GASKET, AND FRONT SEAL.  THIS WAS WITH MILEAGE OF 38,105.  THESE ITEMS SHOULD NOT FAIL WITH THIS LOW MILEAGE AND AGE!!!!  OBVIOUSLY A DEFECT IN MANUFACTURING, AND CHRYSLER WILL NOT ADMIT TO ANY FAULT OF THEIR PRODUCT.  I HAVE RECORDS AND PROOF OF DAMAGED ITEMS IF NEEDED.  I AKSED CHRYSLER TO PAY FOR PARTS ONLY, BUT THEY REFUSED TO DO SO.  THEY ALSO REFUSED TO INVESTIGATE THE SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS FRONT END ISSUE.*JB",
