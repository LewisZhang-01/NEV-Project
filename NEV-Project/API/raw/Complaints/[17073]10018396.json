THIS COMPONENT IS NOT NORMALLY INSPECTED OR REPLACED IN THE ORDINARY SCHEDULE OF MANUFACTURER'S RECOMMENDED CARE.  MY WEB RESEARCH SHOWS QUITE A FEW REPORTS OF THIS SAME FAILURE, INDICATING INADEQUATE DESIGN OR FAULTY COMPONENTS.  AVERAGE MILES TO FAILURE SEEM TO BE AROUND 50,000.  INCREASINGLY, THESE CASES WILL BE SHOWING UP GIVEN THE AGE AND TYPICAL MILEAGE OF THESE CARS.  ANYONE WHO IGNORES THE SOUND LEVEL INCREASE IS LIABLE TO EXPERIENCE A COMPLETE FAILURE ON THE ROAD WITH DEFINITE SAFETY IMPLICATIONS.  NO ONE SEEMS TO BE COMPILING STATISTICS ON THIS DEFECT, EXCEPT PERHAPS SUBARU.  THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT SUBARU AMERICA IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM'S FREQUENCY (A TSB ON IMPROVED REPLACEMENT METHOD), BUT THEY HAVE NOT REGULARLY AGREED TO COVER REPAIR COSTS OR ALERTED OWNERS OF THE PROBLEM'S EXISTENCE.  IN MY CASE, REPAIR IS SCHEDULED SIX DAYS FROM NOW.  MY COMPLAINT CALL TO SUBARU AMERICA RESULTED IN A PROMISE TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER AND CALL ME BACK WITH A RESPONSE ON WHAT ACTION THE COMPANY WOULD TAKE.  IT IS NOW 2+ DAYS AWAITING RESPONSE.    FORESTER (AND PERHAPS IMPRESA) OWNERS SHOULD BE ALERTED TO WHAT IS A VERY STEALTHY FLAW.  THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD BE SUPPLYING GOOD INFORMATION AND ADVICE, AS WELL AS SUPPORTING THEIR PRODUCT.  *JB",
