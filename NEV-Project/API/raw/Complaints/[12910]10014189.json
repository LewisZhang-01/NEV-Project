WHEN THE TRUCK IS STOPPED AT A LIGHT ON A HILL YOU CANNOT PREVENT EXCESSIVE ROLL-BACK OR STALL BECAUSE OF THE DELAY.  IF THE TRUCK IS IN A NOISY ENVIRONMENT THE PROBLEM IS EVEN WORSE BECAUSE YOU CAN NOT TELL WHAT THE ENGINE WILL DO, OR IS DOING UNLESS YOU STARE AT THE TACHOMETER.  YOU CAN NOT PREDICT ENGINE RESPONSE FROM THE THROTTLE POSITION WHEN STARTING OUT FROM A DEAD STOP ON A GRADE.  I HAVE OWNED 3 CARS, 2 TURCKS, BACKHOE AND FARM TRACTOR WITH A STANDARD SHIFT TRANSMISSION AND HAVE A VALID STATE OF OHIO CDL LICENSE.*JB",
