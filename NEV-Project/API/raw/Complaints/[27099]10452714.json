I ENDED UP COASTING INTO GAS STATION WHERE I CALLED AAA AS I WAS AFRAID TO CONTINUE HOME.  IT HAS HAPPENED 7 TIMES SINCE THEN.  THE LAST TIME I WAS ENTERING THE FREEWAY.  I WENT TO DEALER, THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.  ITS OBVIOUS THAT THEY DID.  MANY 2005 CHRYSLER 300C OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM.  CHRYSLER IS NOT STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE AND FIXING THIS WELL KNOWN PROBLEM.  DOES SOMEONE HAVE TO DIE BEFORE THE PROBLEM IS ADDRESSED.  THEY ARE TELLING PEOPLE ALL KINDS OF THINGS INCLUDING CHARGING FOR REPLACING THE GAS TANK. THIS IS DEFINITELY A DEFECT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.  I CANT BELIEVE THEY ARE GETTING AWAY WITH THIS AFTER CHARGING OVER 40K FOR THIS CAR.  *TR",
