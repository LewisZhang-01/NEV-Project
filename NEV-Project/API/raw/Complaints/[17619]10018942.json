THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY EVEN THOUGH I WAS TRAVELING 65 MPH WHEN THE CRASH ACCORDED.  CHRYSLER WAS CONTACTED AND TOOK NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE AIRBAGS.  THEY STATED THE THRESHOLD FOR THE SENSORS WERE NOT MET AND IF THEY HAD, I COULD HAVE BEEN HURT WORSE. THEY SAID AIRBAGS DEPLOY AT 200 MPH AND CAN CAUSE INJURIES WORSE THAN THE CRASH. *JB",
