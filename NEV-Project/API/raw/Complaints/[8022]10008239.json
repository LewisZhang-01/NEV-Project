I WAS CONCERNED SO I DROVE IT AND IMMEDIATELY I HEARD A GRINDING NOISE AND FELT A VIBRATION WHILE APPLYING THE BRAKES. I TOOK IT TO A LOCAL FIRESTONE TIRE AND THEY FELT THE VIBRATION AND HEARD THE GRINDING NOISE BUT THE BRAKE PADS LOOKED GOOD SO THEY ADVISED ME TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER, AS IT WAS PROBABLY A WARRANTY ISSUE.      I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND THEY CHARGED ME $37.00 TO TELL ME THAT THE ROTORS WERE WARPED AND IT'S NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY. I WAS ADVISED VW IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM.  (WHY CHARGE ME $37.00 FOR A PROBLEM THAT (THEY KNOW) THEY HAVE?).    HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN ON A BRAND NEW CAR THAT DOESN'T EVEN NEED IT'S FIRST SET OF BRAKE PADS?   I AM STILL NOT SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF THE BRAKING PROBLEM. THE ROTORS WERE JUST DISCOVERED BECAUSE I WAS COMPLAINING OF A BRAKING PROBLEM. *JB    SECONDLY,WHILE DRIVING, THE CAR JERKS BACK AND FORTH AND SOMETIMES JOLTS.  I AM CONCERNED AS TO WHAT THIS COULD BE. THE DEALER HAS NO IDEA. *JB    I PAID $27,000 FOR THIS CAR TO INSURE MY CHILD'S SAFETY. I AM NOW WONDERING JUST HOW SAFE IT IS.*JB",
