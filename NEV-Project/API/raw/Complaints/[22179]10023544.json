ACCORDING TO LOCAL POLICE, HEADLIGHTS CAN BE STOLEN IN ONE MINUTE OR LESS. NISSAN HAS TURNED A DEAF EAR TO COMPLAINTS OTHER THAN \"THEFT DETERRENT KIT\" WHICH WILL NOT PREVENT WOULD-BE THIEF FROM DAMAGING VEHICLE IN ATTEMPT TO STEAL LIGHTS. I BELIEVE NISSAN HAS RESPONSIBILITY TO CORRECT THIS AWFUL SITUATION.   *NLM",
