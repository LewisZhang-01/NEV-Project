THE CAR COMPANIES APPARENTLY KNOW ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE HAVE INSTALLED A SMALL COVER UNDER THE STEERING COLUMN TO REMOVE AND PUSH A BUTTON TO RELEASE THE KEY SO IT CAN BE TURNED AND REMOVED.  MANY PEOPLE LIKE US HAVE PAID OVER $500 AND STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM. LOOKS LIKE THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL TO FIX THIS. SOME FOLK COULDN'T EVEN SHUT THE ENGINE OFF AND HAD TO DISCONNECT THE BATTERY. THAT' RIDICULOUS. I'M SURE I SPEAK FOR HUNDREDS AND MAYBE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT WISH SOMEONE WOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK AT WHAT IS ON THE INTERNET CONCERNING THIS. NOT EVERYONE HAS A COMPUTER AND ACCESS TO THIS   INFORMATION. THANK YOU. *TR",
