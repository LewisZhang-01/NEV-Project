THAT SIDE GETS SNOW PACKED DOWN IN THERE AND THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT ,OUT IS IF YOU RAISE THE HOOD.  THAT'S HARD TO DO IN A SNOW STORM. HAD TO REPLACE THIS WIPER TRANSMISSION COSTING $256.60.  PLUS NOW I HAVE TO RETURN TO GARAGE TO GET BLADES REALIGNED TO WORK CORRECTLY.  THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A GUARD OR SOMETHING TO STOP THIS SNOW BUILD UP. THE  WIPERS STOPPED BOTH TIMES IN A MAJOR SNOW STORM, WHICH WAS SCARY AND DANGEROUS. I FEEL THIS CAR IS ONLY FOUR YEARS OLD AND SHOULDN'T  HAVE  NEEDED  THIS PART REPLACED. I WAS LUCKY THAT I  WAS ABLE TO GET HOME WITHOUT THIS CAUSING AN ACCIDENT.",
