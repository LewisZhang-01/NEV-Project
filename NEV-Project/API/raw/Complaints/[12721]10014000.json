IT HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE DEALERSHIP DURING THIS PERIOD AND THE PROBLEM COULD BE REPLICATED AT THE DEALERSHIP ON OCCASION.  AS OF NOW THERE IS NO CURE AND WORK CONTINUES.  IT'S BELIEVED TO BE ELECTRICAL IN NATURE.  TO THIS POINT, THE WIRING FROM THE KEY-SWITCH TO THE COMPUTER HAS BEEN BYPASSED, THE ON-BOARD COMPUTER HAS BEEN REPLACED, THE IGNITION MODULE HAS BEEN REPLACED.  THE PROBLEM PERSISTS, WITH A POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS OUT COME. *JB",
