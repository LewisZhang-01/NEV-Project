FINALLY I WAS ABLE TO PULL ON OUT, BUT NOT BEFORE A CAR WAS RIGHT UPON ME.  I TOOK IT TO A DEALER AND TSB EXISTED ON A VALVE IN THE TRANSMISSION.  I BELIEVE THIS TSB SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO A RECALL, BECAUSE I ALMOST GOT HIT WHEN I PULLED OUT BECAUSE THE CAR MORE OR LESS STALLED WHILE I WAS ENTERING THE STREET.  IF YOU SEE THAT YOU HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM TO PULL OUT INTO TRAFFIC, ONE DOES NOT EXPECT THE CAR TO SUDDENLY CREEP OR STALL.  THIS PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY PROBLEM-I EXPERIENCED IT FIRST HAND.    *NLM",
