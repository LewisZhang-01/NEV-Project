        "summary": "I PURCHASE MY 97 BLAZER IN DEC 2000 WITH 35000 MILES FROM A LOCAL DEALER, I BELIEVE IT WAS A PREVIOUS LEASE VEHICLE.  WITHIN ONE YEAR I HAD TO REPLACE BALL JOINTS BUT WAS TOLD THAT I DID NOT QUALIFY FOR A RECALL.  IN FEB OF 2003 I LOST MY HEAT AND SPENT CLOSE TO 2000 DOLLARS REPLACING FIRST THE WATER PUMP, THEN THE RADIATOR.  AFTER THAT DIDN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM, THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT THE SYSTEM NEEDED TO BE FLUSHED WITH A SPECIAL MACHINE THAT WOULD COST ANOTHER 400 DOLLARS.  THE SYSTEM HAD TO BE FLUSHED TWICE TO GET MARGINAL HEAT.  ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP, THE NEXT MOVE IS TO REPLACE THE HEATER CORE.  NOW THE WIPERS STOP WORKING AND ONLY RESTART BY FLIPPING THE SWITCH BACK AND FORTH.  NOT REAL GOOD ON THE HIGHWAY IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC.  I RECENTLY HAD THE ALTERNATOR REPLACED AND THE DEALERSHIP STATED THAT THE SERPENTINE BELT WAS OLD AND CRACKED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  IT ACTUALLY HAD LESS THAN 5000 MILES ON IT AS THEY REPLACED IT IN FEBRUARY WHEN THE WATER PUMP WAS DONE, THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.  THE COMBINATION OF LOUSY SERVICE FROM 2 DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS, A VEHICLE THAT HAS HAD NOTHING BUT ONGOING  PROBLEMS WILL BE ENOUGH TO STOP ME FROM BUYING ANOTHER GM PRODUCT AGAIN.    *NLM",
