        "summary": "97 FORD RANGER 4WD ~79K MILES, MY WIFE WAS DRIVING HOME FREOM WORK ON  BACK ROAD DOING 30 MPH. SHE THOUGHT SHE RAN OVER SOMETHING AND THE TRUCK IMMEDIATELY DIED. NO ENGINE, POWER STEERING OR ANYTHING.  *AK  WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE CRAK SHAFT BROKE OFF AT THE ENGINE BLOCK. A WHOLE ENGINE REPLACEMENT WAS NEEDED.  INSPECTING WHERE THE SHAFT BROKE OFF IT IS OBVIOUS TO ME, THE MECHANIC AND OTHERS THAT PART WAS DEFECTIVE IN THE MANUFACTURE PROCES. ABOUT 40% OF THE RING OF THE SHAFT LOOKS FINE (SOLID STEEL). THE REMAINDER OF THE RING IS ALL POUROUS. IT LOOKS LIKE A BAD FORGE PROCESS.  ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO DAMAGE OR INJURY OR WORSE, I DO BELIEVE THIS DEFECT PRESENTED A DANGEROUS SAFTEY ISSUE. IF THIS HAD HAPPENED ON THE HYWAY THE CONCEQUENCES COULD HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC.  THE DEFECT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT IN SOME QUALITY CONTROL PORCESS. I HAVE CONTACTED FORD ABOUT REIMBURSMENT FOR THE ENGINE REPLACEMENT BUT THEY WILL NOT CONSIDER IT.  I HAVE THE PART THAT BROKE OFF AND CAN SUPPLY YOU WITH DIGITAL PHOTOS IF THAT WOULD HELP.   THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REGISTER THIS COMPLAINT.",
