THIS IS VERY CONCERNING, GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS CAR WAS BOUGHT IN DEC 2002 AND ONLY HAS 2000 MILES, AND WHEN THE PROBLEM OCCURS THE CAR LOSES POWER AND MUST BE TOWED TO A DEALERSHIP.  NOTE LOSING POWER ON THE HIGHWAY, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COLDEST WINTER IN NEW ENGLAND IS NOT A PLEASENT THOUGHT!!",
