THE MAZDA SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AND FOR ME TO CALL BACK IN \"ANOTHER MONTH.\" THE SERVICE MANAGER DOES NOT ANSWER CALLS AND HE DOES NOT RETURN CALLS WHEN I LEAVE A PHONE MESSAGE. I COMPLAINED TO MAZDA AND THEY WERE EQUALLY NOT HELPFUL. I LIVE IN ZONE A AND AM UNABLE TO USE MY VEHICLE AS I NEED TO USE IT (PASSENGERS CANNOT RIDE ON PASSENGER SIDE FRONT). I HAVE ASKED TO BE NOTIFIED WHEN THE PARTS ARE IN STOCK AND I WAS TOLD THAT I HAVE TO CONTINUE TO CALL BACK--THEY WILL NOT NOTIFY ME WHEN THE PARTS BECOME AVAILABLE.    I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO TALK WITH A MAZDA CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER--I GET PLACED ON HOLD AND SOMEONE NEVER ANSWERS.     I NEED TO HAVE THIS REMEDIED. THE LENGTH OF TIME IS RIDICULOUS, AS OTHER MANUFACTURERS ARE COMPLETING THE REPAIRS.",
