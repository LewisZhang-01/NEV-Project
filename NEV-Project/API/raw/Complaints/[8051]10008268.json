I CALL A DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE AND THEY SAID NO RECALL ON THIS YEAR BUT ON THE 1995,  I TOLD THEM THAT MY CAR WAS MADE OCT. 1995. I DIDN'T HAVE WORK DONE AT THE DEALER SINCE I COULDN'T GET TIME OFF FROM WORK. SO I USED A SHOP NEAR MY JOB. THE VAN IS MAKING THE SAME NOISE AGAIN THAT IT MAKES BEFORE THE BELT FAILS, A CHRIPPING AND SQUEAL",
