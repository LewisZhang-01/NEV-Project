THIS IS A RECURRING PROBLEM EXPERIENCED BY MANY USERS OF THIS VEHICLE (SEE COMMENTS AT WWW.CROSSFIREFORUM.ORG; SEARCHFOR \"IGNITION, LOCK, CYLINDER\") AND APPEARS EVEN IN VEHICLES WITH VERY LOW MILEAGE. DEALER ADVICE IS TO REPLACE THE \"IGNITION LOCK CYLINDER\" WHICH IS A VERY EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION. SOME REPORT THAT THE NEW PART ALSO FAILS WITHIN A RELATIVELY SHORT TIME. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A DEFECTIVE COMPONENT THAT SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH A RELIABLE ONE. I WAS STUCK IN A PARKING LOT AT 112F (SOUTHWEST US LOCATION) FOR 1/2 HOUR TRYING TO GET THE IGNITION MECHANISM TO TURN.  THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE DUE TO A STEERING WHEEL LOCKING PIN THAT BECOMES JAMMED. IF THIS HAPPENS WHILE VEHICLE IS BEING DRIVEN, THEN IT COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. *TR",
