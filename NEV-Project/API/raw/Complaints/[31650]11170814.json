MY CAR WAS DIAGNOSED BY LEXUS DEALER AS HAVING CARBON BUILD UP IN ENGINE (TEMPORARY REPAIR WILL COST $600 TO CLEAN ENGINE. PERMANENT REPAIR THAT WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE TO HAPPEN $15,000).  LEXUS DID OFFER A CSP ON THIS ISSUE AND EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THIS ISSUE BUT YOU COULD NOT GO TO THE DEALER AND HAVE IT DIAGNOSED UNTIL THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT DID NOT COME ON UNTIL IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  AFTER MANY PHONE CALLS AND CONTINUOUS COMPLAINING LEXUS WOULD NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT. I FINALLY HAD TO FILE A COMPLAINT THRU THE WARRANTY DEPT AT THE MANU PLANT.  LEXUS FINALLY CALLED ME BACK AND SAID THEY WOULD PAY THE $600 TO CLEAN THE ENGINE, SHE DID TELL ME THAT THE ONLY REASON THEY WERE EVEN TALKING TO ME WAS BECAUSE I WORK AT THE PLANT. I HAD THE ENGINE CLEANED OCT 2017.  THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THIS CARBON BUILD UP WILL RETURN AND I WILL EVENTUALLY NEED AN ENGINE REPLACEMENT.",
