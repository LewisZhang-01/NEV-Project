        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING HOME, FRIENDS WHO WERE FOLLOWING ME PASSED ME THEN CALLEDTO LET ME KNOW THAT MY CAR'S RIGHT FRONT LIGHT AND LEFT REAR LIGHT  WAS NOT WORKING.  FOR THE LAST WEEK OR SO PEOPLE COMING TOWARDS ME BLINKED THEIR LIGHTS .. I HAVE REGULAR CHECKUPS AT THE TOYOTA PLACE, SO I IGNORED IT.  LOOKING BACK ON IT, THEY WERE PROBABLY TRYING TO TELL ME ABOUT THE HEADLIGHT.   I TOOK MY 2008 PRIUS TO THE TOYOTA DEALER TO REPLACE THE BULBS.  THE REPAIR REPRESENTATIVE SAID THAT THE FRONT LIGHTS WERE WORKING BUT THE LEFT REAR LIGHT WASN'T .  WHEN I TOLD HIM BOTH LIGHTS WERE DEFINITELY  NOT WORKING THE PREVIOUS NIGHT, HE SAID IF I WANTED, THEY COULD REPLACE THE  REAR LIGHT WITH A BULB, BUT THE RIGHT HEADLIGHT WAS MORE DIFFICULT DUE TO REMOVING THE BUMPER AND CHANGING THE LIGHT ASSEMBLY (NOT JUST A BULB!).  THIS WOULD COST ME ABOUT  $300. I THOUGHT THAT A BULB REPLACEMENT WOULD DO IT BUT NOT SO, THIS CAR HAS BLUE LIGHTS THAT REQUIRE BUMPER REMOVAL TO EVEN GET TO THE LIGHT.  SINCE THE LIGHT WAS WORKING AT THAT TIME AND $300 IS A LOT FOR A RETIRED SINGLE WOMAN , I TOLD HIM I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT.    NOT KNOWING IF THE LIGHT WILL WORK OR NOT, I QUIT DRIVING AFTER DARK.  HOWEVER, UNEXPECTED RAIN STORMS FORCED ME TO TURN THE LIGHTS ON A COUPLE DAYS AGO.  IT WORKED.  HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM IS I AM NOT SURE IF THEY WILL COME ON OR NOT.  MAYBE THE LEFT HEADLIGHT IS DOING THE SAME THING: GOING OFF AND ON WHEN I HAVE NO INDICATION THAT THIS IS HAPPENING.     I BOUGHT THE PRIUS  TO SAVE MONEY ON GAS AND CALLED IT MY \"LAST\" CAR AND HAVE TAKEN CARE OF IT AS PRESCRIBED.  NOW I DON'T FEEL SAFE TO DRIVE IT AT NIGHT OR WHEN IT RAINS.  *TR",
