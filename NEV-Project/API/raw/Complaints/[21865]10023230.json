PER VEHICLE MANUAL, WHEN THESE TWO LIGHTS ARE ON IT MEANS THAT THE AIR BAG SYSTEM MAY NOT BE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.  THE AIR BAGS MAY GO OFF WHEN THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO OR THEY MAY NOT TRIGGER WHEN THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO.  THE MANUAL SAYS THE CAR SHOULD NOT BE DRIVEN AND SHOULD BE TAKEN TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR IMMEDIATELY.  I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO THE DEALER SEVERAL TIMES, THEY TOLD ME THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG, BUT WHEN I ASKED THEM IF THEY COULD ASSURE ME THE AIR BAGS WOULD WORK PROPERLY OR NOT, THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT SAY THAT EITHER. THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM FOR AT LEAST THE LAST 10 TO 12 MONTHS.  *JB",
