        "summary": "I RECENTLY PURCHASED A 2007 DODGE DURANGO HAD IT BROUGHT UP ON 12/1/2010. THE TANK WAS EMPTY SO I WENT TO THE LOCAL GAS STATION TO FILL UP. LET IT SHUT OFF BY ITSELF WHEN FULL AND THERE WAS GAS SPILLING OUT OF THE TANK AFTER IT SHUT OFF. I ASSUMED IT WAS THE PUMP. SO FEW DAYS LATER HAD TO FILL AGAIN IT DID IT AGAIN DIFFERENT GAS STATION. THERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH THIS TANK AND A REALLY BIG SAFETY CONCERN FOR FIRE OR IF YOU DON'T CLEAN THE GAS OFF THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE NEAR THE TANK RIGHT AWAY. I AM A MOTHER OF 2 SMALL CHILDREN AND THIS TERRIFIES ME. MY CAR HAS LESS THEN 36,000 MILES AND NOT EVEN A TRUE 3 YEARS OLD THIS SHOULD STILL BE CONSIDERED A FACTORY WARRANTY ISSUE OR DO THE RIGHT THING AND PUT AS A RECALL. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GOOGLE THIS AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS TO THOUSANDS WITH THE SAME ISSUE. HTTP://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=FS5U63CN-II HERE IS A YOUTUBE VIDEO OF THE ISSUE MINE DOES AS HIS DOES ALSO. I JUST GOT THIS VEHICLE AND NOT EVEN DRIVEN MORE THAN 23 DAYS AND THE FUEL TANK IS MESSED UP, AND NOW THE GAS CAP LIGHT IS COMING ON AND WONT GO OFF, AND THE MALFUNCTION LIGHT ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL IS NOW COMING ON. I BELIEVE ITS ALL FROM THIS FUEL TANK ISSUE. I CANT AFFORD AN EXPENSE LIKE THIS. NO ONE COULD PREDICT AN ISSUE LIKE THIS.",
