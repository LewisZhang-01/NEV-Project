BY SOME SORT OF MIRACLE OUR DRIVER, GOING 55 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY, MANAGE TO KEEP CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.  THANKFULLY ALL THE CHILDREN ARE SAFE,BUT I AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED THAT I WAS UNAWARE OF OTHER COMPLAINTS REGARDING THESE TIRES.  I WOULD HAVE NEVER LET THE CHILDREN RIDE IN THE VAN WITH THOSE TIRES IF I KNEW THE PROBLEMS WITH THEM.  THERE WAS SOME DAMAGE TO THE DRIVE SHAFT DUE TO THE BLOWOUT, BUT THE VEHICLE IS STILL IN THE REPAIR, SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THE DAMAGE OCCURRED.   *NLM",
