I OWN A 2001 VW JETTA WOLFSBERG T1.8.  PURCHASED: 8/23/01.  CURRENT MILEAGE: 17,200.  WARRANTY: UNTIL 8/23/03.    ON 3/1/03, THE 2ND ENGINE MALFUNCTION OCCURRED.  ONE IGNITION COIL MALFUNCTIONED & THE CAR WAS TOWED TO VW.  WHEN A NEW COIL BECAME AVAILABLE, CAR WAS REPAIRED ON 3/11/03.     VW ALLOWANCE FOR RENTAL CARS IS $25/DAY.  I COULDN'T FIND A RENTAL AT THIS PRICE.  BVW HAS ARRANGEMENTS W/ ECR (OPEN M-F) NEXT DOOR ON RT. 130 -- VW CUSTOMERS CAN GET A CAR FOR $25/DAY.  THOUGHT I HAD INSURANCE THROUGH MY CREDIT CARD, SO I TURNED DOWN LOSS DAMAGE WAIVER ($13/DAY).  ECR FOUND DAMAGE ON CAR.  I AM UNCERTAIN HOW OR WHEN DAMAGE OCCURRED.  I TOLD THEM I WOULD CALL MY CREDIT CARD COMPANY, AND WAS TOLD THEY WOULDN'T COVER ME -- I DIDN'T PAY FOR THE RENTAL.  WHY WASN'T THIS MADE CLEAR AT THE TIME OF RENTAL BY BVW OR ECR?  I CONTACTED VW TO ASK THEM WHY THEY DON'T NOTIFY THEIR CUSTOMERS OF THIS PITFALL, AND THEY SAID THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO -- VW CUSTOMER CARE # 30127362.   I HAVE $500 DEDUCTIBLE ON MY INSURANCE, COST OF DAMAGES TO RENTAL $548.90, INCLUDES LOSS OF USE.  I WILL PAY ECR IN GOOD FAITH.  ONLY ONE COIL (OF 4) REPLACED 3/11/03.  ANOTHER ONE WILL LIKELY MALFUNCTION, LEAVING ME STRANDED AT ANY TIME. BECAUSE I HAD INSUFFICIENT INSURANCE, I PAID $548.90 THIS TIME.  WHAT WILL I PAY NEXT TIME?    WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS IN DEALING WITH VOLKSWAGEN?  IF PARTS WERE READILY AVAILABLE ON MY CAR, WHICH IS UNDER WARRANTY, I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO WAIT TEN DAYS FOR CAR REPAIRS.  ALL FOUR IGNITION COILS SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED AT ONE TIME FOR MY SAFETY.  RIGHT NOW I HAVE A NEW CAR THAT IS UNRELIABLE.  *JB",
