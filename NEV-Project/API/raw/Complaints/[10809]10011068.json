CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER AND THEY  REPLACED THE IGNITION COIL. HAPPENED AGAIN ON 10/31/02, CAR WAS AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR ALMOST 1 MONTH WAITING FOR ANOTHER IGNITION COIL. DEALER  PROVIDED RENTAL CAR AND COMPLAINT WAS FILED WITH V.W. THEY PAID MY CAR PAYMENT FOR MONTH OF 11/02. MANY PEOPLE HAVING SAME PROBLEM. DEALER'S LOT WAS FULL OF CARS WAITING FOR THIS PART. I TOOK THEIR LAST RENTAL CAR, LUCKY FOR ME, SINCE I GOT AN IMPALA SS INSTEAD OF A 2 DOOR CAVALIER. THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ISSUED ON THESE IGNITION COILS. THERE ARE MANY LEMON LAW CASES FILED AGAINST VW.  ALSO VERY POOR GAS MILEAGE AND ACCELERATION. VERY DANGEROUS LEFT HAND TURNS WHEN THE CAR JUST SITS THERE AND YOU'RE HITTING THE GAS!!!*JB",
