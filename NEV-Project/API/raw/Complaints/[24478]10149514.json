VW ISSUED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THAT ENGINE PROVIDED THE CONSUMER CAN PRODUCE OIL CHANGE RECEIPTS SHOWING THE CAR WAS MAINTAINED ACCORDING TO THE OWNERS MANUAL.  I SENT THEM THE PROPER RECEIPTS SHOWING MY CAR WAS MAINTAINED PROPERLY AND THEY STILL DENIED ME. MY CAR ONLY HAS ABOUT 43,000 MILES ON IT AND I JUST BOUGHT IT 10 MONTHS AGO. *JB",
