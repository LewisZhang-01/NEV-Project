WITH POWER STEERING COMPLAINT, THE VIBRATION AND GRUMBLING IN THE STEERING AT SLOW SPEEDS WAS A CAUSE OF CONCERN. AFTER THE STEERING RACK WAS REPLACED, AND LONGER STEERING HOSES PLACED ON THE VEHICLE, THE VIBRATION CONTINUED IN THE STEERING, ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT SUBDUED. THE STEERING PUMP FLOW CONTROL VALVE WAS WORN. WHEN THE FLUID REACHED OPERATING TEMPERATURES, THE VIBRATION INCREASED AND BECAME MORE NOTICEABLE WHEN DRIVING FOR SEVERAL HOURS. THE STEERING FELT NON-RESPONSIVE GOING INTO TURNS AT SLOW SPEEDS. I ENDED UP PAYING FOR THE STEERING PUMP REPLACEMENT, SINCE THE DEALERSHIP DIDN'T CONSIDER MY COMPLAINT A FAULT WITH THE PUMP, ALTHOUGH THE STEERING IS 100% BETTER WITH THE UNIT REPLACED.---*DT. ------DIMS 11 IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS-------769523. *AK",
