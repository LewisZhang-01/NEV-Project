        "summary": "THE WRENCH LIGHT CAME ON AND STAYED ON STEADY AND THE CAR SUDDENLY LOST ALL ENGINE POWER. HEADLIGHTS STAYED STILL ON AND HAZARD LIGHTS WORKED. I TRIED STARTING THE CAR BUT PRESSING THE GAS PEDAL PRODUCED NO MOVEMENT OF THE CAR NOR ANY INCREASE IN ENGINE SOUND.    AFTER TRYING TO START IT SEVERAL TIMES, IT SEEMED LIKE IT STARTED BUT NOT A NORMAL START. THE ENGINE APPEARED TO BE VERY ROUGH BUT AGAIN, NO FAST ENGINE SOUND. IT KIND OF LIMPED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WHICH WAS ON A VERY SLIGHT INCLINE. NO PRESSING OF THE GAS PEDAL PRODUCED ANY SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT OF THE CAR. THE CAR WAS VIOLENTLY SHAKING AS IT LIMPED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AT MAYBE 2 MILES PER HOUR.    ONCE I GOT IT TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD OUT OF TRAFFIC, I DID TURN IT OFF. I GAVE IT ABOUT 30 SECONDS AND IT STARTED NORMALLY. NO MORE WRENCH LIGHT. IT SEEMED TO WORK FINE AFTER THAT. I DROVE HOME ? ABOUT 90 MILES WITH NO FURTHER PROBLEMS.    I REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO OUR LOCAL FORD DEALER. THE DEALER HAS BEEN SUPPORTIVE. FORD MOTOR COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN SUPPORTIVE. WHEN I CALLED THE FORD DEALER EXPLAINING THE SYMPTOMS, THE SERVICE COORDINATOR?S FIRST QUESTION WAS, ?IS IT A FUSION?? HE ALREADY KNEW IT WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH FUSIONS.    HE SAID THAT I AM NOT GOING TO LIKE WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. HE SAID THAT FORD WILL NOT ALLOW HIM TO DO THE 30-MINUTE REPAIR UNLESS A CODE IS AVAILABLE IN THE OBD UNIT. I BROUGHT IT IN AND NO CODE WAS FOUND. THEY TRIED FOR TWO DAYS TO GET IT TO CODE. THE SERVICE MANAGER PLEADED WITH FORD?S UPPER LEVEL TO ALLOW THE REPAIR BUT THEY WERE INFLEXIBLE. THEIR RESPONSE ? ?NO CODE, NO REPAIR.?    FORD?S CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP CENTER WAS USELESS! THEY OFFERED NO HELP.    THE LOCAL DEALER HAD SIX CARS THE WEEK AFTER MY CAR DIED WITH THE EXACT SAME ISSUE AS MINE. I WAS PLACED BACK ON THE ROAD WITH FORD KNOWING I WOULD AGAIN BE STRANDED. IT HAPPENED AGAIN 4 WEEKS LATER.  *TR",
