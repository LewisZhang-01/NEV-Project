TO CINCINNATI, OH. I NOTICED A VIBRATION AND PULLED OVER TWICE TO CHECK IT OUT AND FOUND NOTHING.  AT ABOUT 100 MILES I HAD A CATASTROPHIC TIRE FAILURE, THE ENTIRE TREAD HAD SEPARATED AND DAMAGED THE TRUCK AND THE TRAILER I WAS HAULING.  I CONTACTED FIRESTONE, THEY SENT ME A CLAIM FORM TO WHICH I COMPLETED AND SENT BACK WITH THE TIRE. THEIR REPLY WAS THAT THE TIRE HAD BEEN RUN UNDERINFLATED. THIS HAD NEVER BEEN THE CASE.  PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR MORE INFO AND THE TIRE DAMAGE PHOTOS.  JOHN SPIRA.   *JB    *****DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*****770829",
