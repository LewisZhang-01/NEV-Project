TOWED TO DEALER NEXT MORNING AND THEY CALLED TO SAY LUCKY IT IS UNDER WARRANTY ( I HAVE 64000 MILES , WARRANTY IS 70 K ) AND IT NEEDS A NEW INVERTER. I HAVE NOT SEEN BILL BUT HERE IT IS $ 7 TO $ 9000 YIKES ! THIS IS A PROBLEM AS IT SHAKES MY FAITH IN LEXUS BOUGHT FROM USA TO BRING TO CANADA AND RELIED ON TOYOTA - LEXUS BRAND --- THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING AND FROM WHAT I CAN SEE THE TOYOTA LEXUS HYBRID SYSTEM NEEDS A LONGER WARRANTY !!!!   I BELIEVE IT IS A FAULTY CURRENT INVERTER MADE OF PLASTIC, THEY REPLACE WITH NEWER METAL ONE.  *TR",
