IT HAPPEND 3 TIMES WHEN I STOPPED MY VIHICLE AT RED TRAFFIC LIGHT AND 2 TIMES WHEN BREAKING TO SLOW DOWN, DRIVING DOWNHILL BEFORE A CURVE. THIS 2 TIMES HAVE SCARED ME SO MUCH THAT I AM AFFRAID TO USE THIS CAR AGAIN. I DRIVE CARS FOR 28 YEARS AND NOTHING LIKE THAT HAS HAPPEND TO ME IN MY LIFE. ENGINE STOPS WORKING, ALL LIGHTS GO OUT AND THERE IS NO CONTROL OVER THE CAR WHATSOEVER. I AM HAPPY NO ONE GOT HURT IN THOSE INCIDENTS. THIS CAR HAS ONLY 16K MILES ON IT AND HAS BEEN IN SERVICE NUMEROUS TIMES ALREADY, INCLUDING POWER STEERING LEAK - 2 TIMES REPAIRED. I DO NOT THINK DRIVING THIS CAR IS SAFE AND FOR THAT REASON I CANNOT USE IT ANYMORE.",
