DRAINING MY BATTERY TOO. ALSO A CLICKING SOUND WHEN NOTHING ON. I GOOGLED IT AND WAS SHOCKED TO FIND HUNDREDS OF OTHERS COMPLAINTS. I CALLED CRYSLER THEY SAID TO MAKE A COMPLAINT HERE AND IF ENOUGH COMPLAINTS A RECALL WILL BE ISSUED. I SURE HOPE NO ONE GETS HURT OR DIES WAITING FOR THE MANUFACTURER TO CORRECT THE ELECTRICAL PROBLEM THEY CLEARLY KNOW ABOUT BUT WILL NOT ADDRESS UNLESS THEY ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO. WHAT A SHAME CONSUMERS PAY GOOD MONEY FOR SUCH POOR SERVICE. I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE STAYED WITH A GMC!",
