ALL AT ONCE, THE CAR WOULD ACCELERATE FORWARD REALLY FAST BUT STOP WHEN I PUSH HARD ON THE BREAK PEDAL.  I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE MY FOOT WAS SLIPPING FROM THE BREAK AND ONTO THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WITHOUT ME NOTICING IT, HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT PUBLICITY ABOUT THE GAS PEDAL PROBLEMS WITH TOYOTAS, I AM THINKING THAT MAYBE MY FOOT WAS NOT SLIPPING AND THIS PIECE OF INFORMATION MAY HELP IN THE FAULT ISOLATION PROCESS.  IT DOESN'T HAPPEN ALL THE TIME, I WOULD SAY ABOUT ONCE EVERY FEW MONTHS.  MY REACTION ON THE BREAK PEDAL IS FAST AND IT DOES STOP THE CAR.  *TW",
