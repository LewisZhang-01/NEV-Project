        "summary": "MY 1996 MAZDA 626 TRANSMISSION BURNED UP APPROXIMATELY 100 MILES INTO A ROAD TRIP TO HOUSTON. THE TRANSMISSION HAD BEEN REBUILT IN DEC 2001 AND ONLY HAD 11,000 MILES PUT ON SINCE THE REPAIR. I BROUGHT THE CAR TO A MECHANIC IN HOUSTON WHO SAID THE TRANSMISSION WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED, AT AROUND $2200. I CALLED MY DEALER IN AUSTIN AND WAS TOLD TO BRING THE CAR BACK TO THEM AND IF THE TRANSMISSION WAS FAILING WE WOULD CONTACT MAZDA AND MAYBE THEY WOULD WORK WITH ME ON THE COST. I HAD THE CAR TOWED BACK TO AUSTIN AND LEFT IT AT THE DEALER.  THE NEXT MORNING THE SERVICE WRITER CALLS TO TELL ME ALL MY TRANSMISSION NEEDED WAS A \"COOLER\" INSTALLED AND I WOULD BE GOOD TO GO. ALTHOUGH I FELT THIS COULD NOT BE ANYTHING BUT A BAND-AID, I PAID FOR THE REPAIR AND WENT ON MY WAY. I DECIDED TO DO SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND COUNTLESS STORIES SIMILAR TO MINE ON THE INTERNET. MAZDA WAS AWARE OF THIS TRANSMISSION PROBLEM WHEN THE TRANSMISSION WAS REBUILT AND SHOULD HAVE OFFERED ME THE COOLER THEN. I DID COMPLAIN TO THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE DEALER AND HE REIMBURSED ME FOR THE COOLER. MY PURPOSE IN FILING THIS COMPLAINT IS JUST TO GET THE WORD OUT THERE ABOUT THESE CRUMMY TRANSMISSIONS. I USED TO BELIEVE MAZDAS WERE RELIABLE, SAFE CARS BUT MY CONFIDENCE HAS BEEN SHAKEN. I PLAN TO SELL THE CAR AND BUY ANOTHER KIND OF VEHICLE JUST FOR PEACE OF MIND.*JB",
