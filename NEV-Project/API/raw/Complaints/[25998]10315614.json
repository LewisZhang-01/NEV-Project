        "summary": "THE THROTTLE ON MY 2006 FORD VAN BEGAN STICKING AT APPROX. 55,000 MILES. THIS IS NOT A PEDAL ISSUE, IT WAS THE THROTTLE BUTTERFLY ITSELF THAT WAS STICKING.  THE PROBLEM RESULTED IN EXTENDED STOPPING DISTANCE AND FINALLY FORCED ME TO RUN A RED LIGHT, BUT DID NOT CAUSE AN ACCIDENT (FOR ME)  IT WOULD ALSO CAUSE THE VAN TO REV UP VERY HIGH WHEN FIRST STARTED, EVEN WHEN NO GAS HAD BEEN APPLIED. YOU ALSO HAD TO HOLD YOUR FOOT VERY FIRMLY ON THE BRAKE AT A STOP, OR THE VEHICLE WOULD ACCELERATE TO APPROX. 40 MPH.   I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER REPEATEDLY (CITY FORD IN CARTERSVILLE GA) AND ARGUED WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER ALL THE WAY UP TO THE OWNER OF THE   DEALERSHIP, AND THEY REFUSED TO FIX IT BECAUSE THEY CONSIDERED IT NORMAL WEAR. A STICKING THROTTLE, PARTICULARLY ON A VEHICLE WHICH USES ELECTRONIC THROTTLE CONTROL, VS A CABLE SHOULD NEVER BE \"NORMAL\".   I ARGUED THE ISSUE REPEATEDLY WITH THE DEALER AND ALSO WITH THE FORD ZONE MANAGER, BUT FINALLY, FOR THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY, I WAS FORCED TO PURCHASE A REPLACEMENT THROTTLE ASSEMBLY AND SWAP IT OUT AT MY OWN COST ($150). *TR",
