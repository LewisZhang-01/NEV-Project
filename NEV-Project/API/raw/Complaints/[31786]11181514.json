WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO BACK OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY I AM UNABLE TO TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL.  I PULL BACK INTO THE DRIVEWAY SO THAT IM NOT BLOCKING THE ROAD.  I CUT THE CAR OFF WAIT A MINUTE AND RESTART AND IT STARTS WORKING AGAIN.  I SAW THAT THERE'S A RECALL FOR THE POWERSTEERING.  I CONTACTED THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP SETUP AN APPOINTMENT.  TOOK THE CAR IN & TOLD ME THEY COULD NOT FIX IT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T SHOW THE CODE DURING THE DIAGNOSTIC.  THEY THEN TOLD ME THAT NEXT TIME IT HAPPENED TO NOT SHUT OFF THE CAR AND BRING IT IN OR TAKE A PICTURE.  I DON'T KNOW HOW I CAN BRING IT IF I CAN'T DRIVE IT AND A TOW TRUCK ISN'T GOING TO PUT A RUNNING CAR ON THE BACK OF THEIR TRUCK.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND IF I COME TO YOU WITH A PROBLEM THAT FALLS INTO A RECALL WHY NOT JUST GO AHEAD & REPLACE IT?  I DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE CAR WITH MY KIDS DRIVING AND THIS HAPPENS & I CRASH.  LORD FORBIDS IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ANY OF US NOR ANYONE ELSE WHEN THIS HAPPENS.",
