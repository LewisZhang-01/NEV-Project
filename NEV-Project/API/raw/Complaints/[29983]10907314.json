TOOK TO DEALER AND THEY SAID AIRBAG AND CLOCK SPRING ARE BAD BECAUSE THE WIRING INSIDE THE AIRBAG AND CLOCK SPRING ARE BAD AND I NEED TO PAY TO REPLACE OTHERWISE MY AIRBAG WILL NOT DEPLOY IF NEEDED. I ASKED THEM ABOUT RECALL 08V248000  (LAND ROVER IS RECALLING OVER 37,000 LR3 AND RANGE ROVER SPORT VEHICLES. THE RELATIVE MOTION BETWEEN THE STEERING WHEEL HUB AND/OR STEERING COLUMN COWL WITH THE CLOCKSPRING, WHICH CONTAINS AIR BAG CIRCUITRY, COULD CAUSE A FRACTURE IN THE DRIVER-SIDE AIR BAG WIRING CONNECTION.)  AND THEY SAID NOPE NOT COVERED. I BELIEVE THIS RECALL SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN EVALUATING MY AIRBAG.",
