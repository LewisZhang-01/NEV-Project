THEY HAVE JUST FALLEN OFF.  I HAVE CO-WORKERS WHO ALSO OWN THE SAME VEHICLE, SAME YEAR THOUGH SOME ARE NEWER MODELS THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  I ALSO SEE MANY VEHICLES ON THE ROAD WITH NO COVERS OR BURNED OUT BULBS.  2) ALSO MY FOG LIGHTS HAVE BEEN REPLACED TWICE THIS YEAR THEY BOTH HAVE BURNED OUT ON TWO OCCASIONS.  3) I ALSO NEVER RECEIVED ANY RECALL LETTERS ABOUT MY VEHICLE THERE ARE TWO RECALLS AS OF TODAY.  I ONLY HEARD OF THESE RECALLS THROUGH CO-WORKERS.  4) WHEN I START MY VEHICLE IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY LOCK.  IT WOULD NORMALLY UNLOCK WHEN YOU START IT AND THEN LOCK WHEN YOU SWITCH GEARS TO REVERSE OR DRIVE. SOME DAYS IT WILL WORK PROPERLY AND OTHERS IT WILL NOT. 5) MY LIGHT FOR MY SEAT BELT FLICKERS ON AND OFF.  I ALWAYS WHERE MY SEAT BELT.  I ASSUME THAT THE LIGHT WOULD GO OFF WHEN I BUCKLE MY BELT, BUT IT DOESN'T.*JB",
