AFTER TRYING TO ACCELERATE MORE, THE VEHICLE DID NOT MOVE AT ALL. WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALERSHIP THERE WERE NO WARNING LIGHTS SUCH AS A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AT ALL WHICH MADE ME BELIEVE THERE WAS NOTHING SERIOUS WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE. WHEN IT WAS INSPECTED BY NISSAN TECHNICIANS,  THEY SAID THE TRANSMISSION WAS COMPLETELY BAD AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE IF THE TRANSMISSION IS FAULTY AND THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT SOMETHING WRONG CAUSE ME SERIOUS POTENTIAL DANGER AS I WAS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FREEWAY, UNABLE TO MOVE. BECAUSE THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION, THIS MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FIX THE ISSUE EARLY ON SO THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED.",
