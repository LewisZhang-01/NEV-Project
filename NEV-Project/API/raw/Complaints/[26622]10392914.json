WHEN I WENT TO GET NEW BLADES, THE PARTS MANAGER EXPLAINED THAT THE DRIVER SIDE 26\" BLADES ARE NOT SOLD SEPARATELY FROM THE ARM, AND I WOULD HAVE TO PURCHASE A WHOLE NEW ARM W/BLADE, ALTHOUGH DISTRIBUTORS DO OFFER THE RIGHT SIZED BLADE REPLACEMENT BLADE FOR THE PASSENGER SIDE. THIS VEHICLE IS NOT EVEN TWO YEARS OLD, WHY ARE THE RUBBER BLADES RIPPING OFF THE ARM?  LUCKILY THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR ACCIDENTS AS THE RESULT OF THIS PROBLEM.  *TR",
