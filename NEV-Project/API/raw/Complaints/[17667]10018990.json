DEALER DIAGNOSED AS A \"CRACKED FUEL SENDING UNIT\".  APPARENTLY THIS ALLOWS FUEL TO BE SPEWED OUT OF THE TANK WHEN PARKED.  DEALER INDICATED THAT IT WASN'T COVERED BY WARRANTY DUE TO MILEAGE.  CO-WORKER DISCUSSED ALMOST IDENTICAL PROBLEM WITH HIS YUKON XL (EXCEPT HIS SPEWED MORE FUEL INTO HIS GARAGE AND NEED TO BE CLEANED-UP BY HAZMAT TEAM).  THIS APPEARS TO BE MORE THAN A RANDOM OCCURRENCE OF A PROBLEM THAT HAS SIGNIFICANT SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS.  I BELIEVE FURTHER INVESTIGATION (BY THE NHTSA AND GENERAL MOTORS) IS WARRANTED.   *NLM",
