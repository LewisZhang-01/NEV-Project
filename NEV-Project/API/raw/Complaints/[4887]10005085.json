AFTER CONTACTING SEVERAL TRANSMISSION SHOPS I WAS TOLD THIS IS A PROBLEM AFFECTING ALL NISSAN TRANSMISSIONS UP TO YR 98. THAT IS WHEN NISSAN FIXED THE PROBLEM BY MAKING THE COOLING TUBES LARGER DIAMETER. THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD A RECALL ON THIS BUT DID NOT. THE REVERSE GEAR IS THE FIRST ONE TO BURN OUT. IF YOU CAN GET 125K ON ANY OF THESE TRANSMISSIONS YOU ARE VERY LUCKY. THE TRANSMISSION SHOPS SAY TO MAKE IT OVER 150K IS A MIRACLE. I MADE IT TO 189K.  MAKE NISSAN RECALL THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!              TS",
