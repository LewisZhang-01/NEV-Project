        "summary": "DURING 2018 AND EARLIER, MY 2012 EQUINOX WHICH WAS PURCHASED BRAND NEW 07/25/2012 HAS BEEN BURNING/USING WAY MORE OIL THAN NORMAL.  THE OIL CHECK LIGHT AND/OR CHECK ENGINE LIGHT DOES NOT COME ON.  THERE IS A RATTLING NOISE FROM THE ENGINE, WHICH MY HUSBAND THINKS IT COULD BE THE PISTONS AND/OR VALVES.  THERE IS NO LEAKAGE ON THE CARPORT OR SEALS. I HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN MY VEHICLE TO BE SERVICED AT THE BURIEN CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP.  I HAVE MENTION NUMEROUS TIMES ABOUT THE OIL SITUATION AND THE SERVICING REP. ALWAYS SAID, JUST MAKE SURE TO MONITOR IT.  I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ALWAYS ADDING MORE THAN THE NORMAL AMOUNT OF OIL AND NOT ACTUALLY FIXING THE INTERNAL RATTLING NOISE (ROOT CAUSE).  AFTER RESEARCHING THIS TYPE OF SITUATION FOR MY VEHICLE TYPE, I FOUND IT FALLS EXACTLY IN LINE WITH 'EXCESSIVE ENGINE OIL CONSUMPTION' SITUATION.  SAME AUDIBLE RATTLE OR KNOCK FROM THE ENGINE CAN BE HEARD.  I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THIS AND HAVE A SCHEDULED DIAGNOSTIC TEST SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW.  I SHOULD DEMAND THE DEALER TO SERVICE PERFORM AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST FOR FREE AND IF MY VEHICLE DOES NOT PASS, HAVE THE DEALER FIX THE PISTONS AND/OR VALVES BILLED TO GM.  MY ASK IS'WOULD  NHTSA HAVE ANY DOCUMENTATION AND/OR LINKS TO ASSIST IN FOLLOWING UP?",
