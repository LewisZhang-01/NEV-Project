I HAVE OWNED IT SINCE IT WAS NEW.  OF COURSE THE WARRANTY IS UP SO I AM STUCK WITH THE BILL.  I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING ONLINE AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  THESE PROBLEMS SEEM TO BE VERY COMMON AMONG 96-98 OWNERS.  CALLING GM DOES NOTHING.  PLEASE FORCE THEM TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.  *JB",
