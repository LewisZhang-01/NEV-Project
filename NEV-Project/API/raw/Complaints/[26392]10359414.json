VEHICLE HAS BEEN DOING THIS FOR AT LEAST 1 YEAR .IT IS VERY SCAREY AND UNSAFE FOR MY TEENAGE DRIVER WHO IS JUST LEARNING TO DRIVE. I HAVE ALSO REPLACED THE BRAKES PADS AND ROTORS TWICE ALREADY. THE BRAKES WEAR OUT VERY QUICKLY AROUND 15,000 MILES. LAST I REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION AT 100,000. I BOUGHT A USED 2007 TRANSMISSION TO SAVE SOME MONEY. NOW I AM BEING TOLD THAT MY TRANSMISSION IS BAD AGAIN. IT IS ONCE AGAIN SLIPPING AND I HAVE ONLY DRIVEN 15,000 SINCE THE TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED WITH ONE OD ONLY 56,000 MILES. *TR",
