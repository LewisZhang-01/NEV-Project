        "summary": "THE XENON HEADLIGHTS OF MY 2006 AUDI A4 QUATTRO HAS THIS ANNOYING -- AND  DANGEROUS -- PROBLEM:  1. THE LEFT OR RIGHT HEADLIGHTS FLICKER (THE LEFT ONE WAS RECENTLY FIXED)  2. AFTER FLICKERING THE HEADLIGHT WILL SHUT OFF  3. THE MESSAGE \"LEFT DIPPED HEADLIGHT\" OR \"RIGHT DIPPED HEADLIGHT\" APPEARS  4. THE MESSAGE IS CHANGED TO A SIGN INDICATING THAT THE LIGHTBULB HAS  FAILED.    IF I TURN THE LIGHT CONTROL SWITCH TO OFF (NOTE: WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DRIVING AT NIGHT  HERE) AND TURN IT BACK ON AGAIN, THE LIGHT WILL BECOME NORMAL AGAIN,  FOR ABOUT A FEW MINUTES AND THEN THE CYCLE REPEATS ITSELF.    THE PROBLEM OCCURS MORE IN COLDER TEMPERATURES.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS REPLACED ONE OF THESE VERY EXPENSIVE BULBS, BUT WILL NOT REPLACE THE ONE THAT IS CURRENTLY CAUSING PROBLEMS.  THE CAR IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.      THIS ISSUE IS A KNOWN ISSUE AS MANY PEOPLE DISCUSS THE PROBLEM OVER THE INTERNET.  IN FACT, AUDI OF NORTH AMERICA IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AS WELL BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN SOME SORT OF REDESIGN OF THE BULB AND A TSB HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR CARS THAT ARE LESS THAN 1 YEAR OLD AND HAS LESS THAN 12000 MILES ON IT. I WOULD THINK THEY WOULD WANT TO RECALL THESE CARS ON THEIR OWN BECAUSE IT IS NOT SAFE TO HAVE TO TURN YOUR LIGHTS OFF AND ON WHILE DRIVING IN THE DARK. *TR",
