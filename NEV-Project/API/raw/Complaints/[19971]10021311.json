        "summary": "THE DRIVER'S SEAT POSITION IS CONTROLLED BY MOTORS, CONTROLLED BY 3 CONTROLS ON THE SIDE OF THE SEAT.  THE MOTORS MOVE AT RANDOM, BOTH WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION AND WHILE IT'S PARKED (NO KEY, NO PERSON IN VEHICLE).  THE FIRST OCCURRENCES INVOLVED THE SEAT BACK MOVING BACK AND FORTH.  THIS WAS AN INCONVENIENCE.  THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE INTERMITTENT PROBLEM AND CHOSE NOT TO DO ANYTHING TO RESOLVE IT.  THE PROBLEM HAS INCREASED IN SEVERITY AND NOW THE SEAT ITSELF MOVES BACK WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION.  I AM 5' TALL - IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH MOVEMENT FOR MY FEET TO COME OFF THE PEDALS.  I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN WHILE I AM DRIVING AND WILL CAUSE AN ACCIDENT, AND BELIEVE THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.  I AM ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE DEALER WILL NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM IF THEY CANNOT DUPLICATE IT, LEAVING ME AT RISK. THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT AND PERSISTENT - THERE IS NO SINGLE DATE ON WHICH IT OCCURS/OCCURRED.  THE LUMBAR SUPPORT ALSO APPEARS TO BE MOVING, WHICH MEANS ALL THREE MOTORS/CONTROLS ARE MOVING ON THEIR OWN.  *JB",
