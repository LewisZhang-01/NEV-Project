THERE IS NO ABS LIGHT THAT GOES ON, BUT I CAN FEEL AND HERE THE ABS ACTIVATING. THIS IS CAUSING A GREATER STOPPING DISTANCE THAT IS HARD TO ESTIMATE. THIS HAS CAUSED ME TO COME VERY CLOSE TO HITTING OTHER VEHICLES, AND PEOPLE. THIS PROBLEM STARTED ROUGHLY IN NOVEMBER, AND CONTINUES EVERYTIME THE TRUCK IS USED. I CANNOT GIVE AN ACCURATE NUMBER OF TIMES THIS HAS HAPPENED, BUT IT WOULD BE MORE THAN 50 TIMES. PLEASE HELP ME. THE DEALER TELLS ME THERE IS A RECALL FOR THESE TRUCKS, BUT WHEN I CALL CHEVY, THEY TELL ME MY TRUCK IS NOT INCLUDED. THIS TRUCK WAS JUST PURCHASED FROM A DEALER THAT TOOK IT IN AS A TRADE. THE PREVIOUS OWNER LIVED IN MICHIGAN WITH THIS TRUCK UNTIL TRADING IT IN HERE IN WISCONSIN (ALSO IN THE SALT BELT).  I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THIS SAFETY PROBLEM ADDRESSED BY GM.  *JB UPDATED 07/17/2012 *JS    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",
