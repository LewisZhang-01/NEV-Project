        "summary": "WE MAY BE HAVING TWO SEPARATE  PROBLEMS  WITH THE  2005 GRAND CARAVAN.  THE ISSUE OF PRIMARY CONCERN  WAS THAT THE VEHICLE OCCASIONALLY, AND FOR NO APPARENT REASON , DIED WHILE   BEING  DRIVEN.  SINCE WE OWNED THE VEHICLE THIS HAPPENED ON FOUR DIFFERENT OCCASIONS.  WHEN THE VEHICLE DIED  WE LOST THE ABILITY TO STEER OR STOP.   ON ALL OCCASIONS WE HAVE BEEN GOING AT SPEEDS OF LESS THAN 35 MPH. ON THE LAST OCCASION WHILE  MAKING A RIGHT TURN ON A RED LIGHT THE VEHICLE DIED 1/4 OF THE WAY INTO THE TURN.  HAD THE STEERING WHEEL NOT BEEN TURNED PRIOR TO THE VEHICLE STALLING WE WOULD HAVE BEEN GOING STRAIGHT INTO THE CROSSING TRAFFIC WITH NO WAY OF STOPPING OR TURNING AWAY.  I AM A MOTHER OF 4 CHILDREN AND WAS IN THE VEHICLE ALONE AT THE TIME.  LUCKILY NONE OF MY CHILDREN WERE WITH ME,  AND THE VEHICLES AROUND ME WERE PAYING ATTENTION. I STARTED THE VEHICLE, AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE HOME WITHOUT HAVING THE PROBLEM AGAIN.  ON THE OTHER OCCASIONS THE PROBLEM PERSISTED UNTIL MY HUSBAND WAS ABLE TO GET UP TO SPEEDS GREATER THAN 35 MPH. WE  TOOK THE VEHICLE TO OUR LOCAL DODGE DEALER TWICE FOR THIS PROBLEM,  AND THEY COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM EITHER TIME.  NO REPAIRS WERE  BEEN MADE TO THE VEHICLE IN THIS REGARD.  THE ABOVE SOUNDED  VERY SIMILAR TO THE NHTSA  ACTION # PE05027.  OUR SECOND ISSUE MAY OR MAY NOT BE RELATED TO THE ABOVE AND WE CONSIDERED IT A NUISANCE.  WE INCLUDED THIS INFORMATION WITH THE THOUGHT THAT IT COULD BE A SYMPTOM OF ABOVE THAT OTHERS WERE EXPERIENCING. THE SAME FAILURE. THE VEHICLE WILL NOT START SPORADICALLY.    WHEN WE TRIED  TO START IT ALL OF THE NEEDLE GAUGES ON THE DASHBOARD WILL SHOOT TO THE RIGHT,  AND THEN DROP BACK DOWN TO THE LEFT,  AND BOUNCE AROUND ON THE LEFT QUARTER OF THE GAUGE.    WE ATTEMPT TO JUMP START THE VEHICLE AND AFTER SEVERAL TRIES  IT WILL START UP.  THERE DID  NOT SEEM TO BE A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TWO  PROBLEMS ,  BEYOND THEY BOTH APPEARED  TO BE ELECTRICAL. *AK",
