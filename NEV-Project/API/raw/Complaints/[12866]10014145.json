MY ABS BRAKE LIGHT IS GOING ON AND OFF AND I AM HAVING SOME TROUBLE STOPPING.  MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS COMING ON AND WHEN SITTING STILL THE CAR ACTS AS THOUGH IT IS GOING TO CUT OFF.  IT IS RUNNING REALLY HARD WHEN I COME TO A STOP.  I BELIEVE THAT THESE HAVE TO DO WITH THE RECALL.  ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT I AM HAVING IS MY GAS GAUGE IS NOT REGISTERING HOW MUCH GAS IS IN THE CAR AND THE GAS LIGHT STAYS ON CONSTANTLY.  I KNOW THAT IT IS FULL BECAUSE THE GAS PUMP STOPS.   *NLM",
