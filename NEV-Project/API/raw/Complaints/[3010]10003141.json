I WAS ALMOST IN AN ACCIDENT AS A RESULT OF THIS BOTH TIMES. THE DEALERSHIP HAS REPAIRED MY VEHICLE BOTH TIMES AT NO COST, BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT IF THIS CAUSES ME TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT AND KILL SOMEONE, MYSELF INCLUDED, WHO THEN WILL BE RESPONSIBLE?  IN MY OPINION THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE DEFECT RENDERS THE TRUCK UNSTOPPABLE. THE FIRST OCCURANCE, THE TRUCK ONLY HAD 1200 MILES ON IT.  THE SECOND ONE WAS JUST RECENTLY AT 20,900 MILES.  I'VE ONLY HAD THE TRUCK APPROXIMATELY TWENTY MONTHS. THAT IS RIDICULOUS.",
