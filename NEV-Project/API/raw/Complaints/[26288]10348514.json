THE UNIT INSTALLED IN MY VEHICLE HAS BEEN REPLACED BY ANOTHER UNIT BY FORD. FORD HAS NOT RECALLED THIS DEVICE. MANY OWNERS HAVE REPORTED AND HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THESE DEVICES BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH LOCKS NOT WORKING (OPEN AND CLOSE), HEADLIGHTS NOT WORKING OR TURNING OFF WHILE DRIVING, FALSE SAFETY INDICATIONS BEING DISPLAYED, ETC. I AM NOW EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM AND HAVE TO REPLACE THIS MODULE TO STOP THESE SAME ISSUES IN MY VEHICLE. IT IS A THERMAL PROBLEM AND ONLY OCCURS WHENEVER THE VEHICLE IS WARMED DURING THE DAY IN THE HEAT. IT BEGINS TO WORK PROPERLY AFTER THE AIR CONDITIONER COOLS THE CAB DOWN OR AT NIGHT WHEN THE TEMPERATURES ARE COOLER. THE ORIGINAL PART # IS 2C7T-15K602-AJ, THE REPLACEMENT PART # IS 4C7Z-15604-AC. *TR",
