        "summary": "WHILE MY FAMILY WAS DRIVING IN THE CAR, WITH TWO CHILDREN IN CAR SEATS IN THE BACK SEAT, THE TWO YEAR OLD STARTED CRYING AND TOLD US THE BABY'S CAR SEAT WAS BROKEN.  WE LOOKED BACK AND THE CAR SEAT WAS SIDEWAYS- THE SEAT BUCKLE THAT HELD IT IN PLACE HAD COMPLETELY GIVEN OUT!  WE WERE DRIVING AND I HAD TO LEAN BACK FROM THE FRONT SEAT AND RIGHT THE BABY SEAT WHILE WE PULLED OVER AND MANAGED TO REBUCKLE THE BABY'S SEAT INTO THE MIDDLE.  THE SEATS DO NOT ACTUALLY FIT THAT WAY FOR EVERYDAY USE AND OUR CAR HAS BEEN UNUSABLE TO US EVER SINCE BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO CHILDREN IN CAR SEATS AND NO OTHER WAY TO ARRANGE THEM IN THE CAR.  WE CALLED ABOUT A PART TO REPLACE THAT SEAT BUCKLE AND WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS NOT AVAILABLE ANY MORE.  I THINK THAT THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN- TO HAVE A SEAT BUCKLE GIVE OUT - WHILE DRIVING - WITH A BABY IN IT!  WE HAVE TRADED CARS WITH OUR PARENTS IN THE MEANTIME AND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND THE PART TO FIX IT.  (THIS IS THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE BUCKLE.)  *TR",
