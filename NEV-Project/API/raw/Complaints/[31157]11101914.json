        "summary": "WHILE THE TRUCK WAS IN MOTION TRAVELING ABOUT 70MPH DOWN THE INTERSTATE, MY PASSENGER WINDOW FELL HALFWAY INTO THE DOOR. THIS CAUSED ME TO SWERVE AND ALMOST HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE. IT WAS 20 DEGREES OUTSIDE AROUND 430 AM AND THE TRUCK AND BEEN WARMED UP SUFFICIENTLY AND THE HEATER WAS ON.  HOWEVER I WAS STILL TOLD IT HAPPENED BECAUSE IT WAS COLD OUTSIDE AND THE \"CLIPS\" THAT HOLD THE WINDOW HAD BROKEN. I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO ROLL DOWN THE WINDOW. IT CONSTANTLY KEPT FALLING DOWN BY ITSELF AND I HAD TO HOLD THE POWER BUTTON UP TO KEEP IT FROM DOING SO, WHILE DRIVING IN THE MORNING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC. ONCE I GOT TO WORK AND PARKED MY TRUCK IN A UNSECURED PARKING GARAGE, THE WINDOW WAS UP THIS WAS AT ABOUT 630 AM CST. UPON RETURNING TO MY PARKED/STATIONARY TRUCK AT A BREAK AROUND 9 AM CST, THE WINDOW HAD DROPPED HALFWAY DOWN AND THE SAME THROUGHOUT THE DAY. I WENT TO THE DEALER AT ONCE, AND WAS TOLD THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM, AND ITS NOT COVERED BECAUSE OF MY MILEAGE. SO I HAD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR IT, FOR A VEHICLE THAT IS NOT EVEN 2 YEARS OLD, AND ALMOST CAUSED ME TO HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE. NOT TO MENTION THAT IT WOULD NOT STAY UP AND THE TRUCK WAS NOT ATTENDED TO IN A UNSECURE GARAGE IN THE NOT SO NICE PART OF THE CITY. NOW THE BACK DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW IS DOING THE SAME THING, AND ITS NO WHERE NEAR COLD (CONSTANTLY ABOVE 60 DEGREES EVEN AT NIGHT). THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR ALL VEHICLES THAT ARE MADE BY DODGE THAT HAVE THIS WORTHLESS AND CHEAPLY MADE WINDOW MECHANISMS.",
