I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH MY BRAKES WHICH THEY CAN'T SEEM TO FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE HAD MY STARTER REPLACED TWICE.  I HAVE HAD DEFECTS IN SEVERAL SENSORS, WHICH IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY THAT I HAD TO PAY A GOOD AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THEM TO REPAIR.   MY FAN HAS EVEN BLOWN OUT.  THERE IS A BURNING SMELL WHENEVER I TURN ON MY HEATER THAT NONE OF THE DEALERS CAN'T SEEM TO SMELL.  I ALSO HAD TO PURCHASE A NEW RADIATOR.  WHEN MY COMPUTER WENT OUT MY CAR WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY BUT THEY MADE ME PAY FOR THE REPAIRS, PARTS, AND LABOR OUT OF MY POCKET.  THIS IS NOT ALL. THE LIST GOES ON AND ON.  I HAVE COMPLAINED TO THE DEALERSHIP, FORD MOTOR CO. AND EVEN HAD SOMEONE FROM FORD TO INVESTIGATE ALL OF THE PROBLEMS I'VE HAD WITH MY VEHICLE.  THEY HAVE BEEN RUDE TO ME ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE REPAIRS OF MY VEHICLE.  SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THE PURCHASE OF A MERCURY COUGAR TO ANYONE.",
