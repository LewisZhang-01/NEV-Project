        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING ALONG IN A MAJOR CITY, COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA, WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN MY WHEELS STOPPED TURNING AS I WAS ATTEMPTING TO MAKE A TURN.  I CALLED 911 AND ASSISTANCE WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED.  I WAS DRIVING A 1999 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE LAREDO.  I HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED ANY PROBLEMS SIMILAR TO THIS ONE PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT.  ONCE THE TOW TRUCK AND A VEHICLE MECHANIC ARRIVED IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE STEERING SHAFT WAS DEFECTIVE.  I WAS TOLD THAT THIS PROBLEM COULD HAVE STEMMED FROM A FACTORY DEFECT.  I WOULD LIKE FOR AN INVESTIGATION TO TAKE PLACE REGARDING THE AFOREMENTIONED TYPE OF VEHICLE TO SEE IF THIS INDEED WAS A FACTORY DEFECT.  I HAVE A TOWING AND VEHICLE MECHANIC BILL THAT I HAD TO PAY  REGARDING THIS INCIDENT THAT I THINK SHOULD BE COVERED BY THE VEHICLE MANUFACTURER IF THIS PROVES TO BE A PROBLEM CREATED BY THEM.  THIS COULD HAVE VERY WELL BEEN A FATAL ACCIDENT FOR ME AS WELL AS FOR MY 3, 13, AND 18 YEAR OLD PASSENGERS HAD THIS OCCURRED WHILE I WAS DRIVING ALONG THE INTERSTATE OR AT ANY RATE OF SPEED HIGHER THAN THE SPEED OF ABOUT THE ESTIMATED 15 MPH OR SO WHEN ATTEMPTING TO MAKE THE TURN. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU REGARDING THIS MATTER.*AK",
