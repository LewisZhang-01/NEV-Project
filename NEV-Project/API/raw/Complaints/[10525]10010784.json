I BROUGHT THIS TO THEIR ATTENTION AGAIN IN JUNE OF 2002. 48,743. NO PROBLEM FOUND. IN JAN. 2003 I BROUGHT THIS TO THEIR ATTENTION AGAIN. THEY HAD TO REPLACE THE TIE RODS.  I WAS TOLD AT THIS POINT DUE TO THE MILEAGE ON MY CAR I HAD TO PAY FOR REPAIRS. IN DOING  FURTHER RESEARCH, I DISCOVERED  THE 1999 AUDI A6 HAD A RECALL FOR  TIE RODS. I FEEL THIS MATTER OF THE TIE RODS FOR THE 2000 A6 AUDI SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO. *JB",
