        "summary": "I HAVE HAD 3 OR THE 4 SPRINGS ON MY 2002 FORD TAURUS. BREAK.    BOTH BACK ONES AND THE FRONT DRIVERS SIDE.   THE BACK ONES WERE DISCOVERED, TO BE BROKEN, BY THE DEALER.  I TOOK IT IN BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE THE BACK WAS SCRAPING THE GROUND AT TIMES.   THE OTHER DAY I NOTICED THAT THE TIRE ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE IN THE FRONT WAS FLAT.  AS I WAS TRYING TO BLOW THE TIRE UP, IT WAS DEFLATING JUST AS FAST.  THE SPRING WAS BROKEN AND WAS STUCK IN THE TIRE.  THANK GOD, IT BROKE IN THE DRIVEWAY. THE LAST TIME WE HAD THE CAR ON THE ROAD WE WERE ON THE FREEWAY GOING 65 MILES PER HOUR.  I CALLED FORD AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO AS THERE WAS NO EXTENDED WARRANTY OR RECALL ON THE 2002 TAURUS SPRINGS.  IT SEEMS THAT SOME OF THE SPRINGS WERE COVERED ON THE TAURUS FROM 1999 THROUGH 2001.  WHEN I WENT TO THE GOODYEAR DEALER TO GET A NEW TIRE, THEY TOLD ME THAT THE TAURUS WAS FAMOUS FOR THAT PROBLEM.  I WAS TOLD THAT FORD SIMPLY PUT A SHIELD ON THE 2002 TO KEEP THE SPRING FROM PUNCTURING THE TIRE.  WE COULD FIND NO SHIELD.  IF THE TAURUS HAS AN INHERENT SAFETY PROBLEM THEY ARE AWARE OF, THEY SHOULD HAVE TO FIX IT FREE OF CHARGE.  MY FAMILY HAS HAD FORDS SINCE 1936.  WE HAVE HAD AT LEAST 15 NEW FORDS SINCE THEN.  TO BE HONEST, SINCE I, MYSELF,  SAW THE SPRING STICKING IN THE TIRE, I AM ALMOST FEARFUL TO RIDE IN MY TAURUS.  IF IT IS A PROBLEM, WILL IT HAPPEN AGAIN WHEN I AM DRIVING THE CAR AT HIGHER SPEEDS?    SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.  IT COULD HAPPEN IN ANY BRAND CAR BUT IF THE FORD IS KNOWN FOR THAT PROBLEM AND NOTHING IS DONE THEN SHAME ON THEM.   *TR",
