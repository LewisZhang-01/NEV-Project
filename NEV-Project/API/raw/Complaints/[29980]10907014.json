BMW CLAIMS THAT MY VEHICLE HAD A LIMITED WARRANTY EXTENSION FOR 10 YEARS FROM BUILD DATE, BUT I DID NOT RECEIVE ANY SUCH NOTIFICATION ALTHOUGH I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER AND ALSO LIVED AT THE SAME ADDRESS.  BMW WILL NOT APPROVE A WARRANTY REPAIR AS THEY SAID THE 10 YEAR PERIOD EXPIRED IN 2015.  THE FAILURE OF THIS SENSOR COULD CAUSE THE AIR BAGS TO NOT DEPLOY IN THE EVENT OF A FRONT END CRASH.",
