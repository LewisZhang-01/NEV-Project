        "summary": "SAFETY COMPLAINT INVOLVING A STUCK ACCELERATOR ON A 97 FORD EXPLORER.  THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON A COUNTY ROAD, WHILE TRAVELING A 50 MPH, WHEN A ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO SLOW DOWN THE VEHICLE AS IT APPROACHED AN INTERSECTION.  AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO APPLY BRAKES FAILED, I WAS ABLE TO MANEUVER THE VEHICLE TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER AND STOP IT BY SWITCHING OFF THE ENGINE.  SEARCHING TO FIND THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM, I REACHED FOR THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL, WHICH WAS LOOSE AND SUBSEQUENTLY DANGLED IN MY HAND.    THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO NORTH COUNTY FORD, VISTA CA., WHERE IT WAS REVEALED THAT\"BROKEN ACCELERATOR BRACKET WELDS\" WERE THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM.  THE CAR WAS THEN REPAIRED AT A COST OF $132.89.  ON MONDAY MAY 12 AND AGAIN ON TUESDAY MAY 13, I CALLED FORD MOTOR CO. CONSUMER SERVICE (800) 392-3673, TO REPORT WHAT I BELIEVE IS A SAFETY DEFECT IN THE VEHICLE AND TO REQUEST A REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE REPAIR.  I WAS TOLD BY THE FORD REPRESENTATIVES THAT THE \"INCIDENT\" WOULD BE REPORTED TO THEIR ENGINEERING  DIVISION, BUT SINCE THERE WERE NOT ANY RECALLS ON CASES SUCH AS THIS, THEY WOULD NOT COVER THE COST OF REPAIR.  I CERTAINLY TAKE EXCEPTIONAL TO THEIR FINDING AND EXPRESSED MY DISAGREEMENT.  THEREFORE, I REQUEST YOUR AGENCY TO LOOK INTO THIS INCIDENT AS I FEEL THERE IS A POTENTIAL HAZARD TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND TO HELP DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT I AM DUE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE COST OF THE REPAIR OF THIS DEFECT. *JB",
