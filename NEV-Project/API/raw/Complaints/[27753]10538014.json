SOMETIMES ITS LIGHT SHUTTERING/JERKING, OTHER TIMES ITS VIOLENT SHUTTERING AND JERKING TO THE POINT WHERE IT JERKS SO BAD THE CAR SHUTS OFF.  WE HAVE BEEN TO THE DEALER AND THEY KEEP TELLING US ITS A \"GREEN CLUTCH\" AND JUST KEEP DRIVING IT TO GET IT BROKEN IN.  WE DO NOT SEE AN IMPROVEMENT OVER AFTER A WEEK OF DAILY DRIVING.    WE HAVE VISITED MANY SITES AND REALIZE THERE ARE ALOT OF PEOPLE WHO PURCHASED A 2012,2013 FORD FOCUS HAVING THIS SAME PROBLEM.  *TT",
