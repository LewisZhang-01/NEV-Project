I DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT AS I BELIEVED THAT IT WAS LIKELY THAT MY AIR BAG STILL WORKED, BUT I WAS CERTAINLY WRONG ABOUT THAT.  MY CRUISE CONTROL WAS AND STILL IS OPERATING ERRATICALLY.  YESTERDAY I DISCOVERED THAT THE HORN DID NOT WORK.  I ALSO WAS TOLD THAT ALL THREE PROBLEMS WERE LIKELY CAUSED BY A BROKEN OR DAMAGED CLOCK SPRING.  I BELIEVE THAT CHRYSLER SHOULD DEFINITELY B E REQUIRED TO ISSUE A RECALL REGARDING THESE SERIOUS SAFETY DEFECTS (THE AIR BAG AND THE HORN ARE SAFETY EQUIPMENT) AND REPAIR IT COMPLETELY FOR THE OWNERS AT NO CHARGE.   *NLM    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*763081",
