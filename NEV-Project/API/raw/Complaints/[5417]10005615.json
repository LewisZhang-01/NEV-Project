MY DEALER SAYS THEY CAN PERFORM A TREATMENT FOR APPROX. $100.00 THAT WILL CORRECT BUT NEEDS TO BE DONE EVERY 20000 MILES. MY  VEHICLE IS STILL UNDER NEW CAR WARRANTY BUT THEY SAID THIS SERVICE IS NOT COVERED. I HAVE SEVERAL FRIEND EXPERIENCING SAME PROBLEM. I FEEL THIS IS A DEFECT IN THE NEW GENERAL MOTORS ENGINE.
