DEALER 1 TOOK THE CAR FOR A DAY AN REPORTED THAT PARTS WOULD HAVE TO BE ORDERED. THEY WOULD CALL WHEN PARTS ARRIVED.  AFTER SEVERAL FRUITLESS ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE IF PARTS HAD ARRIVED, CAR WAS TAKEN TO DEALER 2 WHOSE SERVICE MANAGER IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED THE SYMPTOMS AND REPLACED THE POWER STEERING HOSES AND VALVES.  ON THE SECOND VISIT, NOTHING WAS CORRECTED AS DEALER 2 CHECKED THE STEERING WHEEL AREA VALVES AND BEARINGS.  DEALER 2 SAID THAT JEEP ENGINEERS ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND EXPECT TO HAVE A FIX IN A MONTH OR TWO.  FIRST PURCHASED IN JUNE  2002 AND NOTICED WITHIN ONE WEEK.  NOISE CONTINUES TO BE PRESENT.  IS THERE A STEERING AND CONTROL ISSUE LOOMING ON THE HORIZON?.  *JB",
