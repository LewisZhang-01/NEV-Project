        "summary": "BMW HAS HAD A RASH OF ENGINE FAILURES ON THEIR NEW E46 M3'S.  THESE FAILURES USUALLY (IM MY CASE AND MANY OTHERS) HAS RESULTED IN THE ENGINE ACTUALLY BLOWING UP.  THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS FAILURES THAT COULD HAPPEN.  OIL DUMPS ALL OVER THE ROAD, THINGS LOCK UP AND YOU COULD EASILY LOSE CONTROL.  FORTUNATELY FOR ME, I WAS ABLE TO GET OFF THE ROAD AND NO ONE ELSE WAS INVOLVED.  BMW HAS BEEN REPLACING THESE MOTORS UNDER WARRANTY, BUT WILL NOT DISCLOSE THE REASON FOR THE FAILURES OR WHAT HAS BEEN FIXED TO INSURE IT DOES NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.  I HAVE SENT REQUEST TO BMW ASKING FOR AND OFFICIAL RESPONSE TO MY PARTICULAR FAILURE AND WHAT HAS BEEN DONE TO FIX IT ON THE REPLACEMENT MOTOR.  I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY RESPONSE FROM BMW AS OF TODAY.  I HAVE RECEIVED E-MAILS FROM OTHER CONCERNED M3 OWNERS STATING THAT REPLACEMENT MOTORS HAVE BEEN KNOW TO FAIL ALSO.  I CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE ANOTHER ENGINE BLOW.  I MIGHT NOT BE SO LUCKY THE NEXT TIME.  WHAT WORRIES ME MOST IS THAT BMW SEEMS TO BE IGNORING THE PROBLEM.  EVENTUALLY SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET HURT OR KILLED.    *TS    *NLM      **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*768014",
