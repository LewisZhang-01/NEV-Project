THEY HAVE NO FIX AND DO NOT INTEND TO PURSUE ONE.  ALTHOUGH REAR BRAKE IS ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE STOPPING POWER IN A STRAIGHT LINE STOP, IT IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT IN A TURN SUCH AS AN EMERGENCY MANEUVER.  I HOPE THAT THE REQUIREMENT FOR A REAR BRAKE ON A MOTORCYCLE INCLUDES THAT IT FUNCTIONS TO A MINIMAL LEVEL, ABLE TO STOP OR LOCK-UP THE REAR TIRE AT SPEEDS ABOVE 25 MPH.  *SCC    ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****746249",
