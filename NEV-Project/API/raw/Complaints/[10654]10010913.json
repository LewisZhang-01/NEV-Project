WAS FINE FOR ABOUT 30 MILES AND THE CHECK GAUGE LIGHT COMES ON AGAIN AND OIL PRESSURE DROPS TO ZERO. THIS TIME WHEN IT HAPPENED THE ENGINE WAS RAPPING/TICKING LOUDLY. RESEARCHED ON WHAT THE PROBLEM COULD BE AND FOUND MANY PEOPLE WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM AND DODGE WILL NOT DO A THING ABOUT IT.  MOST HAVE LOST THERE ENGINES. MY VEHICLE HAS ONLY 65,000 MILES. WE SHOULD NOT BE EXPERIENCING THIS SORT OF ISSUE.",
