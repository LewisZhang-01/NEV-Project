I TOOK MY TRUCK TO A CHEVY DEALER FOR THE SAFETY INSPECTION AND THEY SAID IT WAS UNSAFE AS THE UPPER RIGHT BALL JOINT WAS IN HORRIBLE SHAPE. I HAD HEARD SOME VERY LOUD POPPING WHEN I TURNED THE WHEEL AND SOMETIMES AFTER TURNING, BUT NEVER GAVE IT MUCH THOUGHT. I TOOK THE TRUCK TO A DODGE DEALER FOR THE SAME INSPECTION BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE CHEVY DEALER MAY HAVE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SOME MONEY ON ME. THE DODGE DEALER REPLACED A FEW BULBS AND SAID IT WAS ROAD READY, \"SAFE.\"  THE OTHER DAY MY STEERING FELT SOMEWHAT BOUND WHEN I WAS DRIVING SO I PULLED OVER TO LOOK AND I WAS ASTONISHED TO SEE THAT THE CHEVY DEALER WAS RIGHT. SO IS DODGE WILLING TO LET SOMEONE DIE AFTER A STATE MANDATED SAFETY INSPECTION TO SAVE A FEW DOLLARS?  *LA",
