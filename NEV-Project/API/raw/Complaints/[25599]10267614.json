AFTER PULLING TO THE SIDE OF THE INTERSTATE, WE SHUT OFF THE ENGINE.  AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES, WE STARTED THE ENGINE AGAIN, FOUND WE HAD POWER, BUT THE CHECK ENGINE WAS STILL ON.  WE DROVE ANOTHER 100 MILES TO OUT DESTINATION.  AFTER SEVERAL HOURS, WE STARTED THE TRUCK AGAIN AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS NOT ON ANYMORE.  WE HAD A COMPUTER CHECK RAN AND THE CODE P1121 CAME UP AND WE WERE TOLD IT WOULD REQUIRE AN ACCELERATOR PEDAL POSITION SENSOR.   WE CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE TRUCK FOR 58 DAYS WITH NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT SHOWING.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN, BUT WENT OFF AGAIN. *TR",
