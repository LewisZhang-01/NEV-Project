WHEN I TOOK THE CAR IN FOR THE FIRST OIL CHANGE, I WAS INFORMED THE HEAD GASKET WAS LEAKING AND IT WAS RECOMMENDED I TAKE IT BACK TO THE DEALER FOR REPLACEMENT. HOWEVER, THE DEALER TOLD ME THE WARRANTY WAS GOOD FOR 3 YEARS OR 36,000 MILES AND THEIR ONLY OFFER WAS TO REPLACE IT FOR $630. I DECLINED, PREFERRING TO TAKE IT TO SOMEONE I TRUST. I HAVE SINCE LEARNED OF AT LEAST TWO OTHER PLYMOUTH/DODGE OWNERS THAT  HAD THEIR HEAD GASKETS REPLACED AT LESS THAN 60,000 MILES. DAIMLER CHRYSLER NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN A MANNER OTHER THAN CHARGING THE OWNER TO REPLACE A DEFECTIVE PART.   *JB",
