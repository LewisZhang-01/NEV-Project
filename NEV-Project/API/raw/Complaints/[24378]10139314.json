        "summary": "*****ATTENTION*****  *****SCION XB SEAT BELTS VERY DANGEROUS FOR LITTLE KIDS*********    REAR DRIVER SIDE SEAT BELTS LOCKING TO THE POINT OF EXTREME PAIN AND SUFFOCATION. THE BELT MECHANISM ONCE LOCKED IT CONTINUES TO RACHET BACKWARD  TO ITS LOCKING STATE SO THAT IF ONE LEANS BACK ON THE SEAT YOU BECOME GLUED TO IT. THE SEAT BELT WILL NOT GIVE IN FORWARD WHICH MAKES  DIFFICULT TO REACH THE UNLATCH BUTTON. THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN!.    MY SON (7 YRS OLD) FELL ASLEEP WHILE ON THE FREEWAY ONLY TO WAKE UP WITH  HIS SEAT BELT LOCKED, I SUGGESTED TO LEAN BACKWARD ON THE SEAT TO GIVE IT SOME SLACK AND THEN TO PULL FORWARD, TO MY SURPRISED THE SEAT BELT BECAME TIGHTER. ONCE I PULLED OVER IT HAD BECOME SO TIGHT AROUND MY SON'S CHEST THAT IT WAS CAUSING HIM PAIN AND DIFFICULTY BREATHING. I IMMEDIATELY ATTEMPTED TO UNLATCH IT BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH THE BUTTON DOWN.  THE ONLY OPTION WAS TO REMOVE THE REAR SIDE PANEL (BEHIND THE BACK SEAT)  AND REMOVE THE ENTIRE LOCKING MECHANISM FROM THE CAR FRAME. IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS SINCE THE INCIDENT AND THE BELT IS STILL LOCKED.     THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS!!! AND IF IT WERE TO HAPPEN IN A FENDER BENDER, FIRE OR AN ACCIDENT COULD POSSIBLY CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY IF NOT DEATH... I'M VERY CONCERNED WILL GET RID OFF THIS CAR..... I WILL BE FILING A COMPLAINT TO THE MANUFACTURER.   *NM",
