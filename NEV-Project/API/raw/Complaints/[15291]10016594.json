I ASLO NOTICED THAT WHEN I AM DRIVING THE VEHICLE I CAN FEEL EVERY VIBRATION AND BUMP IN THEROAD WHILE HOLDING THE STEERING WHEEL AND THROUGH THE GAS PEDAL. I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO THE DEALER IN DECEMBER 2001 AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. THEY TOOK IT OUT FOR A TEST DRIVE BUT DID NOT EXCEED 40 MILES AN HOUR. I HAVE BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALER AT LEAST TWO MORE TIMES AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT. IN DECEMBER 2002 I TOOK THE CAR TO THE SAME DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THE CAR WAS OUT OF ALIGNMENT I HAD THE ALIGNMENT DONE AND THE CAR IS NO BETTER.",
