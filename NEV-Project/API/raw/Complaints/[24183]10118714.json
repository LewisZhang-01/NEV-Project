HAD I NOT NOTICED THIS WHEN CHECKING THE OIL, THE STRUT COULD HAVE BUSTED THROUGH THE TOWER. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO TWO BODY SHOPS, BOTH OF WHICH TOLD ME THAT THEY REPLACE A LOT OF THESE. THIS IS A STRUCTURAL PART OF THE VAN, NOT A FENDER OR A DOOR. THE ESTIMATE FOR REPAIRS IS OVER $1200. IN OCTOBER OF 2002, THERE WAS A SERVICE BULLETIN ISSUED REGARDING STRUT TOWER CORROSION.*AK",
