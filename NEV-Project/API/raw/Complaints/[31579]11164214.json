THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE WHY THIS OCCURRED. THEN, AGAIN ON DECEMBER 30TH THIS OCCURRED AGAIN AT HIGHWAY SPEED, ALMOST CAUSING A COLLISION. IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED THE DEALER AGAIN AND THE DEALER WAS CONCERNED OVER SAFETY ISSUE AND OFFERED A RENTAL VEHICLE WHILE INSPECTING THE VEHICLE. ON THE WAY TO THE DEALER THIS MORNING, THE POWER STEERING TURN OFF AND AGAIN THE MESSAGE CENTER DISPLAYED IN RED \" POWER STEERING UNAVAILABLE SERVICE REQUIRED\".. THIS WAS DISPLAYED ON THE PRIOR OCCASIONS....  WHILE DRIVING SLOWLY TO THE DEALER THIS LOSS OF STEERING OCCURRED ANOTHER 3 TIMES INTERMITTENTLY WITH ANOTHER WARNING \"SERVICE AIR SUSPENSION IMMEDITALEY\"....  KEEP IN MIND THAT WHEN THE POWER STEERING LEAVES WITH ELECTRONIC STEERING VERY LITTLE CONTROL REMAINS. SINCE THIS HAS BEEN REPORTED TO THE DEALERS AND ALSO TO NHTSA NUMEROUS TIMES FROM VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS SINCE AUGUST 2018 I AM SURPRISED THAT A RECALL HAS NOT BEEN ISSUED AND OR A REMEDY THROUGH THE DEALERS.",
