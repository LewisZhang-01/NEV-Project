        "summary": "VEHICLE WAS STARTED AND TRANSMISSION PLACED IN DRIVE, THEN DRIVEN ONTO A CITY STREET ACCOMPANIED BY AN UNUSUAL WHINING NOISE, LURCHING, AND IMPAIRED ACCELERATION.  VEHICLE WAS LIMPED INTO A PARKING LOT, PLACED IN PARK AND SHUT OFF AGAIN, AFTER WHICH IT WOULD NO LONGER CRANK.  VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO DEALERSHIP WHERE INITIALLY THE STARTER WAS REPLACED.  AFTER STARTING THE VEHICLE, THE TECHNICIAN REPORTED SPARKS AND A STRONG BURNING SMELL FROM THE ALTERNATOR, WHICH HE DECLARED UNSAFE TO DRIVE.  THE ALTERNATOR WAS THEN REPLACED, AFTER WHICH THE POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE OR PCM WAS ALSO FOUND TO HAVE FAILED AND WAS REPLACED.    THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS UNCLEAR, BUT THE SAFETY CONCERN STEMS FROM THE SHORTING ALTERNATOR MAKING THE VEHICLE UNSAFE TO DRIVE.  IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT HAD THE DRIVER BEEN UNABLE TO IMMEDIATELY PULL OVER, THE VEHICLE COULD HAVE CAUGHT FIRE AND/OR COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN IN TRAFFIC.    AS OTHER, SIMILAR VEHICLES FROM THIS MANUFACTURER HAVE BEEN RECALLED FOR WEAK ALTERNATOR DIODES FAILING CATASTROPHICALLY (P60 / NHTSA 14V-634), IT SEEMS REASONABLE TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THIS HAZARD EXISTS IN THIS AND OTHER SIMILAR VEHICLES ALSO.",
