I HAVE FOUND THAT TOYOTA KNEW ABOUT THIS DEFECT IN 2006 AND WILL NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. I THINK THAT TOYOTA SHOULD GIVE A 100% REFUND TO EVERYONE WHO BOUGHT THIS CAR BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT THIS DEFECT MIGHT KILL PEOPLE AND THEY DID NOTHING. SO I HAVE THIS CAR AND I AM AFRAID TO LET ANYONE DRIVE IT BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE SPEED. I HOPE THAT THIS CAN BE TAKEN CARE OF SOON BECAUSE WE NEED A CAR TO DRIVE THAT IS SAFE. *TR",
