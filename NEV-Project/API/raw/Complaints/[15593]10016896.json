THE SERVICE MAN INFORMED ME THAT THIS SITUATION NEEDED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE IF IT WAS NOT FIXED THERE WAS A CHANCE THAT A FIRE WOULD START BECAUSE OF THIS MALFUNCTION AND COULD CAUSE A FIRE THAT WOULD TAKE OUT THE ENTIRE WIRING SYSTEM OF MY VEHICLE.   FORD EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THEY DID NOT CONSIDER THIS A \"HAZARD\" IT WAS SOMETHING THEY CONSIDERED A \"MAINTENANCE ISSUE.\"  I HAVE 42,000 MILES ON MY VEHICLE.  I HAVE OWNED 2 EXPLORERS PREVIOUS TO THIS AND ONE OF MY OTHER EXPLORERS EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM AS WELL.    *NLM",
