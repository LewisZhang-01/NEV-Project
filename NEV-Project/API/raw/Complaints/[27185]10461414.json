THE IDRIVE STATED THERE WAS A MALFUNCTION IN THE PASS AIR BAG. I TOOK MY CAR TO THE NEAREST DEALER THE NEXT MORNING AFTER FINDING THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING/ COMMON ISSUE WITH THE 5 SERIES. BUT WHAT I DON'T GET IS WHY IS MY VEHICLES VIN NOT INCLUDED?? IT'S OBVIOUS THIS IS A DEFECT WITH THE PRODUCTION OF THESE VEHICLES SO WHY SHOULD MYSELF OR ANY OTHER OWNER BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS EXPENSIVE REPAIR? WHY ARE THERE ONLY CERTAIN VEHICLES INCLUDED? THEN I FIND OUT THAT IF I'M IN A CRASH, MY PASSENGER WILL NOT BE PROTECTED!! THIS IS NOT FAIR TO OWNERS AND BMW SHOULD BE HELD FULLY RESPONSIBLE. ANOTHER THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THAT I HAVE A RECALL ON THE BATTERY CABLES AND THAT'S COVERED! I READ ONLINE THAT CERTAIN VEHICLES DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCTION DATE (THRU 11/2005) ARE COVERED UNDER THE AIRBAG RECALL. WELL MY BMW WAS MANUFACTURED IN 11/2004! AGAIN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY MY VIN ISN'T COVERED. NOT FAIR!! PLEASE HELP.....  *TR",
