HAVE DISCOVERED THROUGH INTERNET WEB SITES THAT IT IS NOT JUST MY VEHICLE, BUT THOUSANDS HAVE THE EXACT PROBLEM.  DISCUSSED WITH THE LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT GM IS AWARE OF THE POOR/FAULTY DESIGN BUT WILL NOT ADDRESS THE PROBLEM UNLESS, OF COURSE, I WANT TO PAY TO HAVE IT FIXED.  DO NOT FEEL I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR MISTAKE.  THIS IS A SEVERE SAFETY PROBLEM BY IT NOT BEING ABLE TO HOLD THE VEHICLE.  FEEL NHTSA SHOULD FORCE GM TO INSPECT AND FIX ANY THAT HAVE A PROBLEM BEFORE THEY END UP GETTING SUED BECAUSE SOMEONE'S CHILD GOT RUN OVER BY A ROLLING VEHICLE.  SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR DEATHS OR INJURIES TO OCCUR BEFORE SOMETHING IS DONE ABOUT IT!*JB",
