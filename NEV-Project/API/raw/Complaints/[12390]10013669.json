I HAD TO PULL THE 60 AMP FUSE TO KEEP FROM RUNNING THE BATTERY DOWN.  I LOOKED AT THIS SITE AND NOTICE SEVERAL OTHER 1999 SILVERADO OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE PROSPECT OF SHELLING OUT $1000 TO FIX A VEHICLE WITH LESS THAN 50,000 MILES WILL DEFINITELY MAKE ME RECONSIDER MY LOYALTY TO GM PRODUCTS.   *NLM",
