THIS STOPPED THE PROBLEM FOR A SHORT TIME AND HAS PERSISTED SINCE.  I HAVE TRIED TIGHTENING THE BELT, USING BELT DRESSING, AND LUBRICATION THE PULLEY.  MOST TIMES THE SOUND STOPS, ONLY TO RETURN.  IT OCCURS MOSTLY WHEN IT RAINS OR HEAVY MOISTURE IS IN THE AIR.  THE DATE OF FIRST INCIDENT IS INACCURATE, I AM NOT SURE OF THE FIRST OCCURRENCE AT THIS TIME.          *JB",
