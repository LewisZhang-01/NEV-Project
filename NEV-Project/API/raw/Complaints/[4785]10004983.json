        "summary": "MY DAUGHTER PURCHASED A USED 1999 FORD ESCORT FROM COOPER FORD, CAMDEN N.Y., FIRST 9 MONTHS WITH CAR OKAY BUT AS SOON AS COLD WEATHER SET IN SHE STARTED HAVING FUEL PUMP FAILURES. THIS FAILURE CAUSES SUDDEN SHUT DOWN OF VEHICLE, TOTAL LOSS OF POWER. THE FIRST OCASSION WAS WINTER OF 2001-2002, PROBLEM RE-OCCURRED 12-27-02 AND 1-28-03. DEALER INSISTED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS FUEL RELATED THAT THESE FUEL PUMPS WERE SENSITIVE TO ADDITIVES IN FUEL. I BELIEVE THERE IS AN UNDERLYING PROBLEM THAT IS BEING  OVERLOOKED OR TROUBLSHOOTING BY TECHNICIANS IS INADEQUATE. IF FUEL WAS SOURCE OF PROBLEM EVERY OTHER VEHICLE IN THIS AREA WOULD BE AFFECTED ALSO AND I AM UNAWARE OF ANY MASS EXODUS OF FORDS INTO THE DEALERS FOR NEW FUEL PUMPS. THE POSSIBILITY FOR A SERIOUS ACCIDENT EXISTS AS LONG AS THIS PROBLEM REMAINS UNRESOLVED, THE SUDDEN AND COMPLETE SHUTDOWN OF A VEHICLE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS OR WHEN PULLING INTO BUSY TRAFFIC ETC. COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS OR FATAL CONSEQUENCES. IN CONVERSATIONS WITH FORD MOTORS CUSTOMER SERVICE I WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAD NO RECORD OF THIS TYPE PROBLEM WITH OTHER VEHICLES OF THIS TYPE. TECHNICIANS AT DEALER HAVE BEEN COMMUNICATING WITH FACTORY REGARDING THIS PROBLEM AND ALL THE ENGINEERS COULD COME UP WITH IS A \"FUEL PROBLEM\" .APPARENTLY LITTLE OR NO FAILURE ANALYSIS IS TAKING PLACE AS TO WHY ONE PARTICULAR VEHICLE WOULD NEED 3 FUEL PUMPS IN APPROX. 13 MONTHS AND ONLY IN THE WINTER TIME. ANY ASSISTANCE IN THIS MATTER WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES MY DAUGHTER HAS TO DRIVE A \"TIMEBOMB\" THAT WE IN GOOD CONSCIENCE CAN'T SELL WITH THIS DEFECT. THANK YOU. I HOPE I NEVER HAVE TO FILL OUT THE LOWER PORTION OF THIS PAGE!",
