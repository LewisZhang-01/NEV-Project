I FOUND AN ISOLATED STREET AND TESTED IT AGAIN AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN. THE GEAR HANDLE DOES NOT PROPERLY LOCK INTO EACH POSITION AS IT SHOULD. THE SAFETY BUTTON ON THE GEAR LEVER DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY SORT OF PROTECTION. I DID NOT WANT TO DAMAGE MY CAR BY TESTING TO SEE IF I COULD SHIFT FROM DRIVE INTO REVERSE USING THIS NEWLY-FOUND PROBLEM. I'LL LEAVE THAT ONE TO THE AUTOMOTIVE PROFESSIONALS. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS PROBLEM AND DETERMINE IF THIS IS AN ISOLATED CASE OR A VEHICLE DESIGN FLAW. THANKS FOR YOUR HELP!   *NLM",
