        "summary": "ON SATURDAY, 3/6/10 MY THIRD WINDOW REGULATOR WENT OUT ON MY FORD F150 XLT QUAD   CAB. I PURCHASED THE TRUCK IN AUGUST OF 2008 AND I HAVE REPLACED 2 REGULATORS SO FAR. THIS SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE WITH THIS TRUCK, THERE ARE MANY OF THE SAME COMPLAINTS THAT I HAVE FOUND ON THE INTERNET. I CONTACTED WITTMEIER FORD WHEN THE FIRST ONE WENT OUT AND WAS TOLD THAT THE WINDOW REGULATOR WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY. THE SECOND WINDOW REGULATOR WENT OUT IN NOVEMBER 2009 AND I HAD IT FIXED THEN. THIS IS NOW THE THIRD REGULATOR THAT WENT OUT, I WENT TO WITTMEIER FORD TODAY AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE COVERING THIS WINDOW EITHER. PLEASE REVIEW THIS WEBSITE FOR OTHER COMPLAINTS.
