        "summary": "I HAVE A 2001 HONDA CIVIC HX WITH THE CVT TRANSMISSION. AT 14,533 MILES THE TRANSMISSION STARTED TO SLIP WHILE ON THE FREEWAY. IT WOULD LOOSE POWER AND THE REVOLUTIONS WOULD GO WAY UP, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE \"D\" LIGHT ON THE SHIFT INDICATOR STARTED TO FLASH. WHEN I TOOK IT IN TO THE DEALER THEY DID A \"3 TIME FLUSH OF THE TRANSMISSION PER BULLETIN\" AND SENT ME ON MY WAY.  WELL AT APPROXIMATELY 15,000 MILES IT STARTED TO MALFUNCTION AGAIN, SAME SIGNS AND SYMPTONS AS THE FIRST TIME. THE DEALERS SOLUTION WAS TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION. THIS PROCESS TOOK ABOUT A MONTH DURING WICH TIME I WAS PROVIDED A RENTAL CAR.  THERE IS MORE, ON 01/17/03 THE CAR IS NOW AT 40,000 MILES AND EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSMISSION. THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER ON 01/18/03 AND I AM WAITING FOR THEIR DIAGNOSIS.  THANKFULLY I WAS ABLE TO EXIT THE FREEWAY SAFELY ALL 3 TIMES WITHOUT HAVING CAUSED ANY ACCIDENTS.",
