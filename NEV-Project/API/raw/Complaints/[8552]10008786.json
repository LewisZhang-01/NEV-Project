I FOUND IN THE MANUAL THAT THEY ARE ONLY SUPPOSE TO DEPLOY UPON MODERATE TO SEVERE IMPACT. I ALONG WITH 3 OTHER BODY SHOPS AND MY INSURANCE, STATE FARM, FELT THAT THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYED FAULTY AND NEVER SHOULD HAVE GONE OFF. THERE WAS NO OTHER DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE, DEMONSTRATING HOW LIGHTLY THE SIGN WAS HIT. THIS WAS AN EXPENSIVE DEFECT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT, IN CASE IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO SOMEONE ELSE. *TS    ****DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS****760765",
