EACH TIME WAS UNDER A DIFFERENT SET OF ENVIRONMENTS INCLUDING AT NIGHT, A CLOUDY DAY, RAIN, AND SUNNY. IT SEEMS TO FAIL WITHIN 10 MINS OF THE FIRST TIME THE ADAPTIVE CRUISE IS SET. THE GREEN LIGHT THAT INDICATES THE SYSTEM IS WORKING GOES OFF AND TURNS TO ORANGE. I'VE CONTACTED THE DEALER FOR REPAIR BUT ONLINE SEARCHING SHOWS BOTH DEALERS AND HONDA DO NOT HAVE A FIX.",
