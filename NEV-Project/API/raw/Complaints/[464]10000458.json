PICKED UP CAR, WORKED FINE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS THEN SAME PROBLEM HAPPEND AGAIN. CALLED DEALER FOR A TOW. BECAUSE AT THE TIME I WAS TO DRIVE TO DEALER THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT MAKING CAR INOPERABLE. DEALER SAID THE CLAMP THAT CONNECTS TO THE POWER STEERING HOSE CAME LOOSE CAUSING THE POWER STEERING FLUID TO LEAK OUT.  THAT PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE FIXED. MY DEALER ADDRESSED MY ORIGINAL PROBLEM BY THINKING THAT MY KEYS TO THE CAR WERE  TRIGGERING SOME KIND OF ANTITHEFT DEVICE IN THE CARS COMPUTER TO KEEP IT FROM STARTING, THEY GAVE ME TWO NEW KEYS, WORKED FINE FOR ABOUT 30 MILES WHEN THIS TIME WHILE ACTUALLY DRIVING THE CAR WENT COMPLETELY DEAD, I WAS GLAD TO BE IN A TURN LANE AT THE TIME. THE TWO PREVIOUS TIMES IT TOOK ABOUT AN HOUR FOR THE CAR TO RESTART THIS THIRD TIME IT TOOK ONLY ABOUT TEN MINUTES. THE DEALER STILL REMAINS BAFFLED.",
