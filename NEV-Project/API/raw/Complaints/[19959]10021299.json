PROBLEM HAS PERSISTED NOW FOR AT LEAST 50,000 MILES , BUT I JUST LEARNED THAT YOU SHOULD BE NOTIFIED SO THAT FORD CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR POOR QUALITY AND NON SUPPORT.  AS I WAS ADVISED THAT REPAIR WOULD BE ABOUT 600.00.  AS I HAVE A TACH, I SIMPLY USE THIS TO DETERMINE MY SPEED.  I WAS NOT ABOUT TO SPEND THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY ON WHAT I CONSIDER A DESIGN FLAW.*AK",
