THE DEALER TELLS ME THE 36 MONTH WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED.  I SAY WARRANTY OR NOT AT 27,000 MILES THE TRANSMISSION SHOULD NOT BE SLIPPING--UNLESS THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH IT WHEN IT WAS INSTALLED.  I REFUSE TO PAY $2000+ FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION AND AM SEEKING ARBITRATION AGAINST THE DEALER.  I AM ASTONISHED TO SEE ALL OF THE OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE 626 TRANSMSSION I READ ON \"THE COMPLAINT STATION\" WEBSITE.  FROM WHAT I READ ON THIS SITE, THE PROBLEM IS THE FORD TRANSMISSION.  SOMETHING MUST BE DONE CONCERING THIS PROBLEM.  A RECALL IS IN ORDER.  THANK YOU.",
