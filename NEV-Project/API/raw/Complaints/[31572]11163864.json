MY 2017 MODEL OPENED TO AT LEAST 76 INCHES WHICH IS MORE REASONABLE. I CONSIDER THIS A SAFETY ISSUE, AS THIS IS A FLAW IN THE DESIGN OF THE VEHICLE. THE MODEL THAT HAS A POWER LIFT GATE OPENS TO AROUND 76 INCHES.. A FULL 7 INCHES HIGHER THAN THE MANUAL ONE.. THE DEALERSHIP NEVER POINTED OUT THIS PROBLEM TO ME SEEING THAT I AM 74 INCHES TALL.",
