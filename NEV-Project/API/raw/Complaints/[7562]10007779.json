THE DEALERSHIP HAS NOT BEEN NOTIFIED AS OF YET.  I CANT AFFORD TO TAKE IT IN.  I ALOS WANTED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE FACT THAT I HAVE HAD TO HAVE THE ENGINE DECARBED 3-5 TIMES.  DEALER STATES THAT IT IS CONSIDERED NORMAL BY CHRYSLER THAT THE ENGINE HAS SEVERE CARBON BUILD UP AND THAT IT MAY SOME DAY CAUSE MY HEADS TO CRACK.  I DONT FEEL THAT IS RIGHT AND I SHOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE IF IT DOES HAPPEN.  GENERAL MOTORS OFFERS THEIR CUSTOMERS COMPONENT COVERAGE LETTERS WHEN THEY HAVE A CONCERN LIKE THIS WITH THE ENGINE TO SHOW THIER CUSTOMERS THAT THEY STAMP BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT.  I THINK THAT CHRYSLER NEEDS SOMETHING LIKE THIS.",
