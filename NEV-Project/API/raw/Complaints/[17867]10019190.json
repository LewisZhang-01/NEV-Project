I'VE BEEN AROUND CARS FOR QUITE AWHILE AND I KNEW RIGHT AWAY IT WAS A SMELL GIVEN OFF FROM A CATALYTIC CONVERTOR.  WE TOOK THE CAR IN WITHIN A MONTH OR SO OF THE PURCHASE TO HAVE IT CHECKED.  THEY WERE UNABLE TO FIND ANY PROBLEM AND COULD NOT RECREATE THE PROBLEM.  THE PRIMARY THE SMELL WOULD OCCUR WAS WHEN ENTERING THE HIGHWAY OR ACCELERATING FROM STOPLIGHT TO STOPLIGHT.  THE CAR NOW HAW ALMOST 11K MILES ON IT AND THE PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE.  IT IS ALSO NOT GETTING THE SAME MILEAGE THAT OUR PREVIOUS 2000 ACCORD V6 GOT.  THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANYTHING WRONG IN THIS AREA AS WELL.  THIS WILL BE OUR LAST HONDA SINCE THE PROBLEMS ARE OCCURRING WITH NO OBVIOUS SOLUTION AVAILABLE.",
