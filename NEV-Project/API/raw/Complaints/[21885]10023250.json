ATTEMPT TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE BY MOVING THE STEERING WHEEL RESULTED IN THE SUV GOING OUT OF CONTROL. WHILE STILL ON THE ROAD, ANY ATTEMPT TO STEER THE VEHICLE CAUSED IT GO IN AN UNEXPECTED DIRECTION.   FINALLY, THE VEHICLE ROLLED OVER AND LANDED BACK ON THE WHEEL IN A DITCH BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. DRIVER SUSTAINED HEAD INJURIES AND TWO CHILDREN IN CAR SEATS, AGES 1 AND 4, ESCAPED UNHURT IN THE BACK SEAT.  THE CAR SUSTAINED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE ALL AROUND ESPECIALLY ON THE DRIVER SIDE. THE WINDSHIELD, FRONT SIDE WINDOWS, FRONT DOORS  AND FRONT ROOF APPEAR TO HAVE SUSTAINED THE GREATEST IMPACT.    THE FACT THAT THE VEHICLE WENT OUT OF CONTROL SO EASILY SEEMS TO POINT TO A MECHANICAL FAILURE. IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO INVESTIGATE THIS ISSUE TO PREVENT ANY FUTURE ROLL-OVERS BY ANYONE USING THIS VEHICLE.  *JB",
