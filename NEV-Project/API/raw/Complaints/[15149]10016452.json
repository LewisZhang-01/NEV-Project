        "summary": "I HAVE A 2002 MERCURY COUGAR C2 THAT I PURCHASED MARCH OF 2002 AND I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS SINCE THE DAY I BOUGHT IT. WITHIN ONE YEAR OF MY PURCHASE I HAVE HAD ALL FOUR TIRES GO FLAT AND ADDITONAL FLATS ON TOP OF THOSE. MY FUEL PUMP ALSO WENT OUT ON ME APRIL 18TH WITH ONLY 18,000 MILES ON MY CAR. I HAVE ASKED TURNPIKE FORD, WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE, ON OCCASION TO COME AND GET MY CAR FOR ME TO FIX THE TIRE AFTER I HAD ALREADY PUT THE DOUGHNUT ON BUT THEY HAVE REFUSED TO DO SO AND TOLD ME THAT I WOULD HAVE TO CALL ROADSIDE SERVICE. I WOULD UNDERSTAND IF I WERE FAR FROM THE CAR LOT BUT MY WORKPLACE IS ONLY A FEW MILES AWAY. I CALLED ON ONE OCCASION TRING TO GET A NUMBER TO CALL MERCURY/FORD TO COMPLAIN TO THEM BUT THE SALES REP TOLD ME THAT SHE DOES NOT HAVE THAT NUMBER THAT I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK FOR IT MYSELF. I HAVE ALSO CALLED THE OWNERS OF THE LOT TO TALK TO THEM BUT I CAN NOT GET THEM TO RESPOND TO MY PHONE CALLS. I WAS JUST UPSET  ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR BUT NOW I AM ALSO UPSET ABOUT THE SERVICE THAT I AM RECEIVING OR IN MY CASE NOT RECEIVING. THANK YOU FOR YOU ATTENTION IN THIS MATTER.",
