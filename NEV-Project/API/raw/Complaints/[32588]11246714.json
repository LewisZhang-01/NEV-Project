I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR MULTIPLE TIMES TO MY LOCAL NISSAN DEALER. 1ST TIME, THEY REPLACED A FAULTY VALVE BODY, 2ND TIME THEY REPROGRAMMED THE SOFTWARE, 3RD TIME THEY DID A VIBRATION SOFTWARE UPDATE. STILL SHUDDERS IN LOWER GEARS, STILL HAS A VIBRATION WHILE IDLE, BUT THEY CLAIM THAT THEIR TECHNICIANS \"CAN'T FEEL IT\" OR THAT THEY \"CAN'T GET THE CAR TO DUPLICATE\". RIDICULOUS. THEY KNOW THE TRANSMISSION IS FAULTY AND THEY DON'T WANT TO FOOT THE BILL.",
