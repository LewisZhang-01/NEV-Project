THE MANUFACTURER HAS REPLACED THESE TIRES UNDER WARRANTY. THIS LAST TIME  I MENTIONED THE TIRES GIVING ALOT OF ROAD NOISE, THE SERVICE MANAGER STATED THAT SINCE THE PREVIOUS REPLACEMENT OF TIRES ON MY VEHICLE SATURN HAS COME OUT WITH A \"SHIM\" KIT FOR THE REAR END .  WHEN MENTIONING THIS TO A FRIEND WHO WORKS IN AUTO MANUFACTURING SHE STATED THAT THIS WOULD BE A  SAFETY ISSUE . TO MY KNOWLEDGE SATURN IS NOT RECALLING THESE VEHICLES NOR IS THEIR CURRENTLY A \"CAMPAIGN\" ON THIS ISSUE . THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE OF MICHIGAN IS WORKING ON THIS CASE WITH ME UNDER THE LEMON LAW OF MICHIGAN BUT I CAN NOT LET THE SILENCE  CONTINUE IF THIS IS ALSO A SAFETY ISSUE. THE TIRES ARE FIRESTONE AFFINITY.   *NLM",
