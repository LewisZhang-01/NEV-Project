I WAS WONDERING IF I CAN STILL GET THE RECALL, AND GET NEW TIRES. THESE TIRES ARE NOT SAFE, AND I ENCOUNTER A BUMPY RIDE. THE VEHICLE I BOUGHT IS A JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE, AND THE CAR WAS A THEFT RECOVERY, SO THE FIRESTONE TIRES WERE ON THE CAR, SO NO RECALL COULD OF BEEN DONE. THE TIRES MAY STILL BE DANGEROUS, AND I WAS WONDERING WHAT TO DO TO GET NEW ONES. THANKS, I WOULD BE THANKFUL TO HEAR BACK FROM YOU.       *JB",
