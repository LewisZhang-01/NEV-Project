I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A MECHANIC WHO REPLACED THE BRAKES AND MASTER CYLINDER HOWEVER THAT DID NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM OF NO BRAKE PEDAL. I THEN TOOK THE VEHICLE TO FORD WHERE THEY ADVISED THAT THEY HAVE SEEN A RASH OF THIS PROBLEM, AND ADVISED THAT IT IS MOST LIKELY THE ABS CONTROL MODULE. THE VEHICLE IS AT THE FORD DEALERSHIP AS I TYPE. THIS IS THE SECOND ISSUE WITH THIS VEHICLE, THE FIRST WAS A BRAKE BOOSTER FAILURE THAT MADE THE BRAKE PEDAL VERY HARD TO PUSH.",
