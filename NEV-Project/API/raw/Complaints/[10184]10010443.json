        "summary": "OCTOBER 2002 I PURCHASED A NEW BMW X5 - SHORTLY THERE AFTER I STARTED TO EXPERIENCE INTERMITTENT ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS - HEADLIGHTS WOULD NOT SHUT OFF WITHOUT RE-STARTING THE CAR, INTERIOR LIGHTS WOULD NOT TURN OFF, THE FLASHERS WOULD COME ON, THE REAR LATCH WOULD DISCONNECT, THE KEYLESS ENTRY INTO THE CAR WOULD NOT WORK, BATTERY WAS BEING DRAINED AND ULTIMATELY THE BATTER WOULDN'T EVEN HOLD A CHARGE.  AFTER 3-4 MONTHS OF EXPERIENCING THESE INTERMITTENT PROBLEMS, I INSISTED THE DEALER TAKE THE CAR BACK AND LET ME  PURCHASE A 2003 BMW X5.  I RECEIVED THE NEWEST BMW X5 ON FEBRUARY 26, 2003 AND ON MARCH 10, 2003, I STARTED EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS AGAIN!  THIS TIME, WHEN THE IGNITION WAS TURNED ON, THE FLASHERS CAME ON AND THE INTERIOR LIGHTS WOULD NOT SHUT OFF WITHOUT ME OPENING THE DOOR AND CLOSING IT AGAIN - I HAD TO MANUALLY SHUT OFF THE FLASHERS.   MINUTES LATER AFTER DRIVING THE CAR, I SHUT OFF THE IGNITION, GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND USED THE KEYLESS ENTRY SYSTEM TO LOCK THE CAR AND ARM THE ALARM.  I WASN'T ABLE TO LOCK THE CAR DOORS BUT THE ALARM WAS ACTIVATED.  I HAD TO TURN THE ALARM OFF AND OPEN THE DOOR AND CLOSE IT AGAIN.  THEN I WAS ABLE TO LOCK IT.  THE CAR HAS BEEN AT THE DEALER SINCE AND THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM. *JB",
