        "summary": "ON OR ABOUT 4/21/05 I WAS DRIVING MY 2001 FORD F-150 TAKING MY SON AND NEPHEW TO SCHOOL. AS I MADE A RIGHT TURN AT THE SCHOOL MY ENGINE STALLED. I LOST ALL STERING CONTROL AND HAD JUST ENOUGH BRAKE POWER TO SLOW THE VEHICLE. I PUT THE TRUCK IN NEUTRAL AND STARTED THE TRUCK. I TOOK IT TO MY LOCAL FORD DEALER AND THEY REPLACED THE AIR INTAKE CONTROL VALVE. ABOUT 2 WEEKS LATER AT THE EXACT SAME SPOT AND TIME THE ENGINE AGAIN STALLED ON ME. AGAIN, I LOST ALL STERING AND HAD JUST ENOUGH BRAKES TO SLOW SO I COULD PUT THE TRUCK IN NEUTRAL AND START THE ENGINE. MY FORD DEALER IS TELLING ME THEY CAN NOT FIND THE PROBLEM WITH IT AND STATED I COULD PICK THE TRUCK UP AND DRIVE IT IF I WANTED TO. NOT WANTING TO HAVE MYSELF OR MY FAMILY KILLED IN A CAR CRASH I TOLD THEM NO AND THAT THEY NEEDED TO FIX THE TRUCK. THEY AGREED TO TRY AND FIX THE TRUCK. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HELP ME WITH THIS NEXT ISSUE BUT IF YOU CAN I WOULD APPRECIATE IT. WHILE THEY TRY TO FIND THE PROBLEM WITH MY TRUCK THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO KEEP MY TRUCK FOR 30 DAYS AND I WOULD HAVE TO RENT A CAR. AT $20 PER DAY FOR 30 DAYS THAT WOULD COST ME $600. I CAN NOT AFFORD THIS AS FORD REFUSES TO LEND ME A CAR. THANK YOU. ROBERT R. HERNANDEZ",
