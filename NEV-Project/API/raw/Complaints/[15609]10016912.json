THE TRUCK FORCED ME INTO THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME SO HARD THAT I CRUMBLED THE TRUNK OF THAT VEHICLE. IN ALL 5 VEHICLES RECEIVED DAMAGE. MY VEHICLE WAS TOTALED. MY SEAT BROKE AND MY AIRBAGS INCLUDING A KNEE AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY. I RECEIVED WHIPLASH TO THE NECK AND DAMAGE TO MY RIGHT LEG. I FEEL THAT HAD MY AIRBAGS DEPLOYED I WOULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED THE DAMAGE TO MY LEG. ALSO I BELIEVE HAD MY SEAT BACK SUPPORT STAYED UPRIGHT I WOULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED THE INJURIES AS BAD.   *NLM",
