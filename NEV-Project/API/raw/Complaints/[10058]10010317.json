        "summary": "I PURCHASED MY 2003 FORD EXPEDITION BACK IN SEPTEMBER 2002. IN LESS THAN A MONTH THE AUTOMATIC ADJUSTING SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ON THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER STARTED MALFUNCTIONING. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR BUT TO NO AVAIL. I WAS INFORMED THAT IT WOULD BE MARCH 2003 BEFORE A REPLACEMENT PART OR FIX COULD BE MADE. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING AROUND WITH THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS HAZARD, NOT KNOWING IF MY MIRRORS WILL TAKE IT UPON ITSELF TO START ADJUSTING WITHOUT WARNING BECAUSE OF A DEFECT THAT THE DEALERS REPAIR SHOP OR FORD CAN NOT EXPLAIN. I WAS PROMISED THAT THIS PROBLEM WOULD BE FIXED IN MARCH 2003. I WAS CALLED BY  PALMETTO FORD HERE IN CHARLESTON SC. ON FEBRUARY 28, 2003  AND INFORMED THAT THERE WAS PARTS IN TO FIX MY MIRRORS. UPON DROPPING MY VEHICLE OFF FOR REPAIR I WAS CALLED ABOUT MID-DAY AND ADVISED THAT THE WHOLE DRIVERS SIDE MIRRORS NEEDED REPLACING AND THAT IT WOULD BE BEST TO LEAVE THE CAR OVER NIGHT SO THAT THEY COULD EXPEDITE THE PROCESS WHEN THE MIRROR CAME IN.  AFTER PICKING MY VEHICLE UP AFTER THE REPAIRS WERE MADE I HAD TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE REPAIR FACILITY WITH THE SAME PROBLEM OF THE MIRRORS GOING HAY WIRE. I REALLY FEEL THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AT A HIGHER LEVEL. AT THIS POINT I BELIEVE THAT I AM GETTING THE RUN AROUND. TOO MANY MONTHS HAVE GONE BY WITHOUT A SOLUTION TO THIS ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN. I AM REAL CONCERNED ABOUT THE OVERALL SAFETY OF MY FAMILY WHILE DRIVING A VEHICLE THAT COULD LEAVE YOU IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION WHEN YOU THINK YOUR SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE IN ONE POSITION WHILE DRIVING AND THEN WHEN YOU GO TO LOOK TO CHANGE LANES ABRUPTLY ETC. THEY ARE  TOTALLY OUT OF ALIGNMENT POINTING UP TO THE SKY.   PLEASE CONTACT ME ON THIS MATTER.*JB",
