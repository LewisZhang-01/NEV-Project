WITH IN 2 WEEKS, SRS LIGHT CAME BACK ON STAYED ON AGAIN. I BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE HONDA DEALER AND WAS TOLD THE SRS CONTROL UNIT WAS DEFECTIVE AND IT COSTS $825.50 AT OWNER'S EXPENSE. IT WASN'T SIMPLY FAIR AND I AM NOT HAPPY TO PAY FOR THIS. IT IS NOTHING THAT I DID WRONG, SIMPLY ONE OF THEIR SAFETY FEATURES WAS DEFECTIVE. SINCE THERE WAS ANOTHER CASE EXIST ON THIS. IT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED AND MAY NEED TO RECALL THIS. IF THE SRS SYSTEM BECOME DEFECTIVE, IT IS VERY DANGEROUS AND HONDA SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIR.    *NLM",
