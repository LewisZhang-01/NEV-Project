TRUCK HAS BEEN TO THE DEALER 3 TIMES AND DODGE SAYS THIS IS THE WAY THEY ALL ARE. AT 4272 MILES THE FRONT TIRES SHOW SIGNIFICANT FEATHERING, AND IS STALLING OUT WHEN DRIVING AROUND CORNERS IN LOW GEAR  MODE (@ INTERSECTIONS AND PARKING SPACES). DODGE SAYS THAT THE FRONT AND REAR AXLES ARE NOT LIMITED SLIP BUT POSITIVE TRACTION AND RECOMMENDS THAT I PUSH IN THE CLUTCH TO KEEP FROM STALLING. THEY WANT ME TO DOUBLE-CLUTCH TO GET THROUGH AN INTERSECTION WHEN I MAKE LEFT HAND TURNS? I FEEL THAT THIS IS A DESIGN ERROR WITH SAFETY IMPLICATIONS.  *NLM",
