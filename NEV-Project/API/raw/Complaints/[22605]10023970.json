INSIDE RIGHT REAR DUAL ON OUR 31 ' 97 WINNEBAGO VIBRATED FOR ABOUT 3 SECONDS AT HIGHWAY SPEED AND THEN A LOUD NOISE (TREAD CAME OFF AND I COULD SEE TRAFFIC BEHIND ME AVOIDING THE TREAD). THE TIRE STILL HAD AIR IN IT, BUT ALL TREAD HAD COME OFF. MY WIFE AND I ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED THIS EXPERIENCE COULD HAPPEN AGAIN WITH MUCH WORST CONSEQUENCES. THE TREAD RIPPED A VOLLEY BALL SIZE HOLE IN THE WHEEL WELL JUST UNDER THE HOT WATER HEATER.   *NLM",
