        "summary": "I OWN A 2002 GMC ENVOY SLT.  MY PROBLEM IS WITH THE REAR GLASS IN THE LIFTGATE.  IN THE EIGHT MONTHS OR SO THAT I HAVE OWNED THIS VEHICLE THE REAR GLASS KEEPS POPPING OPEN WHEN I HIT BUMPS.  I DO NOT OPEN THE REAR GLASS OR THE LIFTGATE VERY OFTEN RIGHT NOW BUT I PROBABLY WILL ONCE MY CHILD GETS HERE IN MARCH.  THAT IS HOW I KNOW ITS NOT FROM FAILING TO CLOSE THE GLASS PROPERLY.  THIS HAPPEND AT LEAST 20 TIMES SINCE I HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND ASKED THEM TO LOOK AT IT AND THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG BUT THERE MUST BE SOME SORT OF DESIGN FLAW THAT ALLOWS THIS THING TO JUST POP OPEN WHEN YOU HIT A SMALL BUMP (ITS NOT JUST LARGE BUMPS OR POTHOLES THAT CAUSE IT TO OPEN).  I WOULD REALLY LIKE GMC TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT OR SOMETHING FALLS OUT OF THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE AND INJURES SOMEONE.",
