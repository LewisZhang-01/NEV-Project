THIS IS GOING TO COST NEARLY $1,000.00 AND IS ABSOLUTELY NOT A ROUTINE ISSUE IN A VEHICLE THIS NEW AND LIGHTLY DRIVEN. AFTER RESEARCHING THE MATTER FURTHER ON THE WWW IT IS OBVIOUSLY THAT STEERING ISSUES ARE A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM IN DODGE INTREPIDS AND THEY POSE SERIOUS SAFETY RISKS. I IMPLORE YOU TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS! DO NOT WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE GETS KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT BEFORE YOU DO. FOR MORE INFORMATION VISIT: HTTP://INTREPID.CLAN-510.ORG/ACCIDENT.HTM",
