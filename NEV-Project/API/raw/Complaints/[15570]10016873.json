        "summary": "I HAVE A 1995 FORD F150 WITH DUEL FUEL TANKS. I DROVE HOME FROM WORK AND FOUND MY TRUCK FLOWING FUEL OUT OF THE FRONT TANK FILLER AFTER THE TRUCK WAS SHUT OFF. I RESEARCHED QUICKLY ON LINE AND FOUND THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHER PEOPLE WITH 94-95 TRUCKS THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. THEN I CHECKED YOUR INTERNET SITE. THE FOLLOWING ARE RECALL NUMBERS FOR THE SAME PROBLEM...EXCEPT THEY ARE FOR THE YEARS OF 1990-1993. 01I0080000 , 93V125000 , 00V424000 .  I WENT TO MY LOCAL FORD DEALER THAT I BOUGHT THE TRUCK FROM IN SEPTEMBER OF 2002. THEY SAID NOTHING COULD BE DONE BY THEM BECAUSE THERE IS NO RECALL FOR MY TRUCK.  I WOULD LIKE SOME ANSWERS...THIS IS THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM THAT THEY ADMITTED TO IN THE EARLIER VEHICHLES! FORD NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS PROBLEM. THE SERVICE WRITER AT THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THEY HAD SEEN THIS BEFORE IN THIS YEAR VEHICLE.     I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY FORD CAN GET AWAY WITH SUCH AN OBVIOUS SAFTY ISSUE. SHOULD I FILL BOTH FUEL TANKS AND PARK MY TRUCK IN FRONT OF THIER SHOWROOM DOOR?   PLEASE HELP ME RECTIFIY THIS SITUATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.   GREG HANSON",
