ALTHOUGH I FILED A COMPLAINT LAST YEAR, GM HAS DECIDED THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE NUMEROUS INCIDENTS REGARDING THE CHEAP PARTS THEY USED IN THESE VEHICLES, THEY WOULD NOT ISSUE A RECALL.  IN FACT, THERE WAS A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE 2 WEEKS AGO THAT STATED THERE WOULD BE NO RECALL BECAUSE MOST OF THESE ACCIDENTS WERE IN NORTHERN STATES WHERE SALT IS USED ON THE ROADS IN WINTER. HOWEVER,  NOW THEY HAVE ISSUED A VERY LIMITED RECALL FOR CADILLAC CTSS FOR THE EXACT YEARS THAT OUR GMC SUFFERED SAME KIND OF BRAKE FAILURE.  THE COST TO REPLACE THESE FAULTY PARTS IS ESTIMATED AT $2000 PER VEHICLE. BUT THE DANGER TO LIFE AND PROPERTY IS MUCH GREATER.  DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THERE CAN BE SUCH A LIMITED RECALL WHEN MORE THAN THIS ONE MODEL IS AFFECTED. AND YES, I MITIGATED MY DAMAGES BY HAVING BRAKES REPAIRED. BUT FEEL THAT I WAS CHEATED, NOW THAT RESTRICTED RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED.  *TR",
