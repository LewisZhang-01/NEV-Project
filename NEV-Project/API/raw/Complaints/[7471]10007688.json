        "summary": "ON FEB 16 MY WIFE LOST THE POWER STEARING ON OUR 2002 DODGE GRAND CARRIVAN [MINNI-VAN]    ON 17 FEB 03 I CALLED THE GARAGE THAT SOLD US THE VAN AND DISCRIBED THE PROBLEM. THEY { SERVICE MANG.] TOLD ME ON THE PHONE THAT I PROBLEY HAD A BROKEN POWER STEARING HOSE.   I HAD THE VAN TOWED TO THE GARAGE AND THEY MADE MORE STATEMENTS OF A LARGE NUMBER OF THESE HOSES BRAKEING IN THE COLD WEATHER. IT HAS BEEN EXTREAMLY COLD IN MAINE THE PAST WEEK OR SO -20 TO -30 DEGREES.    THE SERVICE MANAGER STATED THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL ON THIS. I CAN NOT BELIVE THAT CHREYSLER HAS NOT PUT OUT A RECALL ON THIS. NUMBER ONE THIS IS A SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER STEARING WITCH COULD PUT ME IN DANGER OF HAVEING A ACCIDENT. HOW ABOUT THE 97 POUND WEEKLN WHO COULD NOT CONTROL A MINI VAN WITH ON PWOERSTEARING!!   THERE IS ALSO A DANGER OF FIRE IF THE POWER STEARING FLUID IS IN CONTACT WITH THE EXHAUST.   AS FAR AS I KNOW THE REPALCEMENT HOSE IS OF THE SAME MATAREAL AS THE OLD HOSE AND IS JUST A LITTLE LONGER.   WILL SOME ONE FROM YOUR OFFICE BE IN CONTACT WITH ME ? I WOULS LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE GREAT WHITE FARTHER IN WASHINGTON IS DOING TO PROTECT ME FROM THE MONEY HUNGRY CORPS. THAT PRAY ON MY TRUST.   THANK YOU",
