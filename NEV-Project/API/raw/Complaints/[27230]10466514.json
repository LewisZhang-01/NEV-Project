I PICKED UP THE CAR AND DROVE APPROX 20 MINS WHEN I NOTICED THE STEERING WHEEL WAS NOT ALIGNED. CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND HAD TO BRING IT BACK IN BECAUSE THEY FORGOT TO ALIGN THE WHEELS. STARTED OFF ON MY DRIVE BACK HOME, STOPPED FOR GAS AND ON THE WAY OUT THE DRIVEWAY (10 MPH), I HEARD A GRINDING/SQUEAKING NOISE. GOT MY CAR HOME AND FOUND THAT IT WAS LEAKING POWER STEERING FLUID FROM A CLAMP. I KEPT PS FLUID IN THE CAR. TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP IN APPROX. NOVEMBER AND THEY TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED TO HAVE A NEW PS PUMP AND RACK/PINIONS RESEALED, THE COST OF APPROX $1800.00, OF WHICH I CANNOT AFFORD. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING THE CAR, JUST KEEPING PS FLUID IN IT, BUT IT LEAKS OUT. I HAVE NO POWER STEERING. I HAVE HAD THE RECALL CLAMP REPLACE TWICE, ONCE IN 2003 AND THEN IN 2007.  *TR",
