        "summary": "THE HALOGEN HEADLAMPS ON THE 2018 EXPEDITION ARE COMPLETELY INADEQUATE FOR A 2018 VEHICLE. THEY ARE DIM, AND THEY ARE ANGLED DOWN WITH A LOW CUTOFF.     I BROUGHT MY VEHICLE TO THE DEALER AND THEY ADJUSTED THE LIGHTS AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE, WHICH DID NOT ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.     FORD OFFERS AN OPTIONAL LED HEADLAMP SYSTEM WHICH APPEARS SIGNIFICANTLY BRIGHTER AND SAFER, BUT AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THESE ON THE DEALER LOTS. IT'S WILDLY IRRESPONSIBLE TO SELL A BRAND NEW VEHICLE FOR $65000 + THAT HAS HEADLIGHTS FROM THE  1990S. THEY ALSO CLAIM THAT THIS SYSTEM CAN NOT BE RETROFITTED TO THE HALOGEN HEADLAMP MODELS.     DRIVING AT NIGHT ON A ROAD WITHOUT STREET LIGHTS IS UNSAFE. YOU CAN'T SEE ROAD SIGNS, ONCOMING TRAFFIC, PEDESTRIANS ON THE ROAD, ETC. VISIBILITY IS LIMITED TO A VERY SHORT DISTANCE.     THERE ARE MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS ON THIS NHTSA SITE ABOUT THE INADEQUATE LIGHTING, WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO GET FORD TO REPLACE THE HALOGEN LIGHTS WITH THE LED LIGHTS?",
