        "summary": "ON THE MORNING OF SUNDAY, MAY 4TH, 2003, I MADE A SHARP RIGHT HAND TURN AND INADVERTENTLY DROVE OVER THE CURB WITH MY PASSENGER SIDE FRONT WHEEL.  I IMMEDIATELY HEARD A LOUD NOISE AND THE TWO DRIVER'S SIDE AIRBAGS WENT OFF.  I SUFFERED ONLY BRUISES FROM THE IMPACT OF THE AIRBAGS.  THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO MY INSURANCE COMPANY ON MONDAY, MAY 5TH.  ON TUESDAY, MAY 6TH, I CALLED THE DEALER TO GET MY CAR IN FOR WORK.  AS OF TODAY, FRIDAY, MAY 9TH, I STILL HAVE NOT HEARD BACK FROM THE DEALER, WHO NEEDED TO ORDER THE PARTS.  WHEN I'M ABLE TO SCHEDULE THE APPOINTMENT TO TAKE MY CAR IN, MY INSURANCE COMPANY ASKED TO HAVE THEM CHECK TO SEE IF THERE WAS A JOLT TO THE FLOOR PAN OR SUSPENSION THAT MIGHT HAVE CAUSED THE AIRBAGS TO GO OFF.  THERE IS NO VISUAL DAMAGE TO THE WHEEL, AND THE CAR IS DRIVABLE.  (I'VE BEEN DRIVING IT TO AND FROM WORK THIS WEEK).  I DON'T BELIEVE THE AIRBAGS SHOULD HAVE WENT OFF IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION.  I'M NOW VERY AFRAID TO DRIVE IT WITH THE FEAR OF HITTING A SPEED BUMP OR A POT HOLE!!!!  IF THERE HAD BEEN A LOT OF TRAFFIC AT THAT TIME OF THE MORNING, A VERY BAD ACCIDENT COULD HAVE RESULTED.  *JB",
