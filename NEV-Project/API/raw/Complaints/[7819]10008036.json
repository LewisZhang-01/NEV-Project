THE DIAGNOSTIC AT THE DEALERS CANNOT LOCATE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE ENGINE LIGHT DOES NOT COME ON.  PLUS THEY CHARGE ME 50 DOLLERS FOR DIAGNOSTIC HOOKUP FEES SINCE THEY CANNOT LOCATE THE PROBLEM.  THIS APPARENTLY IS COMMON PRACTICE AMONG MANY DEALERSHIPS AND IS REFFERED TO AS DOUBLE DIPPING SINCE THE MANUFACTURER PAYS THE DEALERSHIP EVERY TIME I BRING THE CAR IN.  THE DEALERSHIP AND MANUFACTERER ACCEPT NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CAR HOWEVER AFTER FIGHTING ON THE PHONE WITH THEM FOR WEEKS I HAVE A SUSPISION THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.",
