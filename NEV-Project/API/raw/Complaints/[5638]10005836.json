IN TWO INCIDENTS INVOLVING THE SAME CONDITIONS:     1) TRUCK , WHEN CRUISE CONTROL ENGAGED, SUDDENLY ACCELLERATED TO SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF 90 MPH, ON ICY AND SNOWY INTERSTATE (JANUARY 2003), BETWEEN NASHIVILLE AND CINCINNATI, OHIO.    2) TRUCK , WHEN CRUISE CONTROL ENGAGED, SUDDENLY ACCELLERATED TO EXCES OF 90 MPH, ON DRY INTERSTATE (71) BETWEEN CINCINNATI, OHIO AND COLUMBUS OHIO.    IN BOTH OCCURRENCES, TRUCK TOTALLY NON-RESPONSIVE TO BRAKING ATTEMPTS, TO THE EXTENT THAT DRIVERS STOOD ON THE BRAKES TO ATTEMPT DISENGAGEMENT OF CRUISE CONTROL. ALL OTHER ATTEMPTS AT TURNING OFF ALSO INEFFECTIVE (SWITCHES NON-RESPONSIVE AS WELL). BRAKES HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY DAMAGED.    DRIVERS BOTH MAINTAIN THAT ACCELLERATION HAPPENED WITHOUT WARNING AND ONLY DISENGAGEMENT OF THE TRANSMISSION (NEUTRAL) CEASED ACCELLERATION. THE RPM OF THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO MAINTAIN 4,000+ RPM AND ONLY COULD THE ENGINE BE DISENGAGED WHEN VEHICLE WAS STEERED INTO SOFT GROUND TO BE SLOWED.    THIS PROBLEM IS REPETITIVE AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AS IS, BUT EGREGIOUS WHEN MIXED WITH ICY/SNOWY CONDITIONS.     FORD DELAERSHIP NON-RESPONSIVE TO GREATER ISSUE; ATTEMPTING TO SHIF LIABILITY ON DRIVERS AND EXPECTING REPAIRS TO BE SHOULDERED BY DRIVERS/OWNERS.     DRIVERS MAINTAIN GOOD DRIVING RECORDS AND NOW BELIEVE THIS PROBLEM TO BE LIFE-THREATENING. DRIVERS HAVE ALSO NOTED MULTIPLE OTHER CONSUMERS WITH SAME EXACT PROBLEM AND ARE AWARE OF RECALLS INVOLVING THIS SAME TYPE OF PROBLEM IN OTHER FORD PRODUCTS.",
