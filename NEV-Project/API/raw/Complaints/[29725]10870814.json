THE ROADWAY IS FLAT AND STRAIGHT THE 4+ LANES ARE 150 YARD APART, NO OVERPASSES.  THERE WERE NO OTHER CARS OR TRUCKS WITHIN 100 YARDS OR MORE. AND A VERY LOUD NOISE, LIKE A GUN SHOT \" BLEW OUT\" THE REAR GLASS ( THE FRONT CAN MOVE, THE REAR CANNOT ) IN THE SUNROOF.  I ONLY HAVE ABOUT 8000 MILE ON THE SUV.  FORD DOES NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM AND KEEPS SAYING IT MUST HAVE BEEN A ROCK.  I CAN'T PROVE THEY ARE WRONG AND THEY CAN'T PROVE THAT I AM CORRECT.  SO MY INSURANCE PAYS, WHICH MEANS WE ALL LOSE.",
