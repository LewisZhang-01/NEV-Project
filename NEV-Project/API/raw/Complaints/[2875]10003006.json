THIS ISSUE WOULD COME AND GO - NOTHING WAS EVER DONE ABOUT IT.   WHY?  B/C BY THE TIME I COULD GET AN APPOINTMENT FOR MY CAR THE POPPING  WOULD STOP.  WE NEVER DID GET IT WHERE THE MECHANIC COULD FIND THE PROBLEM.   THIS WOULD  OCCUR ON AN IRREGULAR INTRAVALS - AND WOULD LAST MAYBE A DAY - MAYBE UP TO 3 DAYS AND THEN QUIT.  WAS ABLE TO GET IT TO THE DEALERSHIP THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED AND THE SERVICE GUY AND A MECHANIC HEARD IT - BUT THEY COULD DO NOTHING ABOUT IT THAT DAY - GAVE ME AN APPOINTMENT TO RETURN FOR THEM TO LOOK AT IT MORE COMPLETELY  - BY THEN IT HAD QUIT AND THEY STILL LOOKED IT OVER - COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING THAT LOOKED OUT OF THE ORDINARY.",
