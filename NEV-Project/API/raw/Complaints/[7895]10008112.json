IT'S RUNNING NOW, BUT FOR HOW LONG BEFORE IT GOES BACK IN THE SHOP IS ANYBODY'S GUESS. I ASKED ONE OF THE SERVICE ADVISORS IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER SPORT TRACS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM, HE SAID NO. IF THAT WAS THE CASE, WHY WAS THE PART HE NEEDED TO FIX MY TRUCK ON NATIONAL BACKORDER? THIS NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT TO EVERYONES ATTENTION THAT HAS A SPORT TRAC. GAS SPITTING OUT IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED IN TO BEFORE SOMEONE IS SERIOUSLY HURT OR KILLED! *JB",
