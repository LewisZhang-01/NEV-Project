MY VAN IS A WHEELCHAIR VAN AND THE SLIDING DOOR IS MY ONLY MEANS OF EXIT. I HAD A WHEELCHAIR VAN MECHANIC TAKE THE WHOLE LOCKING MECHANISM APART AND HE DISCOVERED THERE WAS A FLAW IN THE DESIGN OF THE DOOR ACTUATOR. HE MADE A MODIFICATION AND IT WORKED. THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM IN ALL YEAR MODELS OF THE CHRYSLER TOWN & COUNTRY VANS. IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION, THERE IS NO WAY OF OPENING THE DOOR. THE MANUAL LOCK STICKS IN THE LOCKED POSITION AND WILL NOT RELEASE, EVEN UNDER FORCE. CHRYSLER IS WELL AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM. CHRYSLER COULD AT LEAST ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND MAKE A RETROFIT PART FOR THESE DOORS. *TR",
