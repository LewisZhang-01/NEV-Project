LOOKED AT FORUM AND FOUND THAT MANY 2003/2004 MERCEDES BENZ SL CLASS HAS THE SAME PROBLEM WITH DEFECTIVE GAS TANK BAFFLE.  WHENEVER I BRAKE OR ACCELERATE, I HEAR THE KNOCKING NOISE, WHICH ALSO KNOCKS TWO OR THREE TIMES EVERYTIME I BRAKE OR ACCELERATE.  IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING IS HANGING FROM A STRING OR FLOATING AND THEN BECAUSE OF INERTIA IT KNOCKS AGAINST THE SIDE OF A CONTAINER.  THE HAZARD THAT I FEAR IS THAT THE FLOATING MATERIAL IN THE GAS TANK KNOCKS AGAINST THE TANK AND CREATE A SPARK THAT CAN IGNITE THE TANK CAUSING A FIRE.  THE KNOCKING NOISE HAPPENS EVERYTIME THE CAR JERKS FROM BRAKING OR ACCELERATING.  *TR",
