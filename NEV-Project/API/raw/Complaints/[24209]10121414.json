ON MAY 17, 2005 I DROVE THIS CAR ON HIGHWAY AT SPEED APPROXIMATELY 55 MILES/HOURS AND SUDDENLY LOSTED CONTROL. I REDUCED SPEED, BUT COULD NOT CONTROL CAR AND IT PULLED OFF THE ROAD AND STOPPED. THE LEFT REAR TIRE BECAME FLAT.  I CONTACTED GOODYEAR (CLAIM #766745). IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOOODYEAR, NOTHING WRONG WITH TIRE. IT JUST LOSTED SEAL. THEY REFUSED TO REPLACE TIRE. GOODYEAR AUTHORIZED REPAIR FACILITY DIXIELAND (776 SOUTH BLAFF STREET, ST. GEORGE, UT 84770) RESEALED TIRE. TIRE SIZE IS 185-65-R15 AND IT IS NOT IN YOUR LIST.",
