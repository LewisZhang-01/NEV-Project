        "summary": "WHEN MY VEHICLE HAD LESS THAN 200 MILES ON IT THE CHECK FOUR WHEEL DRIVE LIGHT CAME ON. WHE HAD ONLY HAD THE CAR FOR LESS THAN A WEEK. I ASKED THE DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT AS LONG AS IT WAS RUNNING FINE THE WOULD PUT IT ON THE COMPUTER AT MY 3,000 MILE CHECKUP. A FEW WEEKS LATER I STARTED HEARING A RUBBING NOISE. I BROUGHT IT IN AND THEY TOOK IT FOR A TEST DRIVE. THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD SWICHED IT FROM 2 WD TO 4WD HIGH AND THE NOISE WAS GONE. IT WAS NOT. THE NEXT DAY I SWITCHED IT INTO AWD AND THERE WAS NO NOISE. THAT AFTERNOON THE FRONT WHEELS LOCKED UP ON ME WHEN I WAS GOING ABOUT 30 MPH. WE HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP. THEY TOLD US THAT THE FRONT DIFFERENTAL WAS LITTERALY FALLING APART AND HAVE NOW SAID THEY ARE GOING TO REPLACE THE TRANSFER CASE. THE MILAGE ON OUR ENVOY IS 1263. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I AM NOT HAPPY. I PURCHASED A NEW VEHICLE SO I WOULD NOT HAVE PROBLEMS. I HAVE ONLY HAD IT FOR A MONTH. *AK",
