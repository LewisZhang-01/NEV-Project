I PULLED INTO THE GARAGE, TURNED THE VAN OFF, AND MY EIGHT YEAR OLD GRANDSON PUSHED THE BUTTON TO OPEN THE AUTOMATIC DOOR AS HE SAT IN THE FRONT SEAT.  NOT KNOWING THAT MY TWO YEAR OLD GRANDAUGHTER HAD GOTTEN OUT OF HER CHILD SEAT AND WAS BETWEEN THE SEAT AND THE DOOR, THE DOOR OPENED AND SHE FELL INTO THE TRACK.  I CAUGHT THE DOOR AS IT PINNED HER BY THE WAIST IN THE TRACK, BUT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO MOVE.  IT TOOK ALL MY STRENGTH TO KEEP IT FROM CRUSHING HER.  PLEASE, FOR THE SAFETY OF OTHER CHILDREN, MAKE THIS DOOR STOP MOVING IF SOMETHING OR SOMEONE HITS THIS TRACK!  SHE IS OK, BUT BRUISED AND SORE.  I AM AWARE THAT THERE IS AN OVERRIDE SWITCH TO STOP THE DOOR, BUT IN A PANICK IT DIDN'T COME TO MIND.*JB",
