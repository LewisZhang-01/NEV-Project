I HAVE CHECKED WITH OTHER OWNERS ON MESSAGE BOARDS, WHO HAVE THE EXACT SAME COMPLAINT. THIS WAS A HIGH TICKET AUTOMOBILE AND I BELIEVE THE INNER REFLECTORS HAVE BURNED OUT OVER A SHORT TIME. IT IS A SAFETY HAZARD AS THE LIGHT DOES NOT DISPERSE. I AM ASKING ALONG WITH MANY OTHER OWNERS TO TRY AND PUT PRESSURE ON FORD TO RECALL ALL THESE SUBSTANDARD HEADLIGHTS FOR MARK V111 LINCOLNS AROUND 1994 TO 1996.
