        "summary": "ON DECEMBER 27, 2002 I EXPERIENCED POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SAFETY ISSUE WITH MY HONDA ACCORD LX V4 2002.  ON A EXIT OUT OF A SHOPPING CENTER I REGULARLY GO TO (TERRA NOVA SHOPPING CENTER ON EAST H IN CHULA VISTA, CALIFORNIA) THE CAR IN DRIVE STARTED TO ROLL BACK AFTER THE BRAKE WAS RELEASED AS TRAFFIC STARTED TO MOVE FORWARD.  IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE VEHICLE FROM CONTINUING TO REVERSE IN FREE FALL AND STRIKE ANOTHER CAR IN THE REAR IT WAS NECESSARY TO SLAM THE ACCELERATOR DOWN TO REGAIN FORWARD MOTION.  AFTER I GOT HOME I CALLED MY DEALER (TIPTON HONDA IN EL CAJON, CALIFORNIA) AND ONE OF THE TECHNICIANS INFORMED ME THAT A SLIGHT ROLLBACK WAS NORMAL IN SMALL CARS BECAUSE OF THEIR TRANSMISSIONS.  I THEN CALLED A FRIEND OF MINE WHO HAS A DEGREE IN AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEERING AND HE TOLD ME THAT ROLLBACK IS NOT NORMAL ON ANY CAR; THERE IS A BRAKE THAT IS SUPPOSE TO ACTIVATE IN THE TRANSMISSION TO PREVENT THIS WHEN THEN THE CAR IS STOPPED.    I THEN BEGAN TO CONTACT OTHER LOCAL HONDA DEALERS,  BALL HONDA IN NATIONAL CITY, CONNECTED ME TO A TECHNICIAN WHO SAID THAT IN ORDER TO MEET THE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS ON EMISSIONS (VTEC ULEV) IN CALIFORNIA THE TIMING HAD TO BE ALTERED WHICH DOES RESULT IN SOME ROLLBACK.     THE NEXT WEEK I TALKED TO LATEEFAH FROM HONDA (CASE NO. 12002-12-300-1175) AND SHE OTHER CUSTOMERS HAD REPORTED THIS AND HONDA WAS AWARE OF IT BUT THE ENGINE WAS DESIGNED TO MEET SPECS AND THEY WOULD NEVER SELL AN UNSAFE CAR.  SHE STATED A SERVICE BULLETIN HAD BEEN ISSUED AND SAID THAT THE DEALER SHOULD BE HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT IT  SHE STATED THAT ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS MOVE YOUR FOOT FROM THE BRAKE TO THE ACCELERATOR.  AFTER I TALKED TO HONDA I TRIED THE CAR ON MY UNCLE'S DRIVEWAY AND WE FOUND THAT IT ROLLED BACK WHICH HIS CAR DOES NOT AND THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE IT WOULD STOP EXCEPT WHEN IT LEVELED OUT.  AS NEITHER HONDA NOR THE DEALER WILL DO ANYTHING TO FIX THE PROBLEM I FIND MYSELF UNABLE TO SAFELY DRIVE THE CAR ANYWHERE WITH A STEEP INCLINE.",
