I LOST POWER STEERING AND BRAKES.  AS THE VEHICLE ROLLED, I WAS ABLE TO GET IT OVER TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD OUT OF TRAFFIC .  I ATTEMPTED TO START IT A COUPLE OF TIMES BEFORE NOTICING THAT GAS WAS COMING OUT FROM UNDERNEATH THE DRIVERS AREA AND WAS POURING ONTO THE GROUND.  I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A LOCAL MECHANIC WHO ADVISED THAT THE GAS LINE BECAME DISCONNECTED.     I HAD JUST LEFT MY SON IN SURGERY AND WAS TO COME BACK TO PICK HIM AND MY WIFE UP.  THIS INCIDENT COULD HAVE BECOME VERY BAD AND KILLED MYSELF AND POSSIBLY MY FAMILY HAD THEY BEEN IN THE VEHICLE.  THIS NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED AND ACTION TAKEN.  IN THE PAST I ALONG WITH MY WIFE HAVE REPORTED VEHICLE PROBLEMS TO THE DEALER WITH THEM TAKING LITTLE TO NO ACTION.  PLEASE HELP   ALSO THE STEERING APPEARS TO BE BECOMING A PROBLEM.       *JB",
