I HAVE TO QUICKLY SLAM ON MY BRAKES TO AVOID HITTING SOMETHING.  I FEAR AT SOME POINT IT MAY BE A PERSON.  THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A WHILE BUT I WAS NEVER ABLE TO REPRODUCE IT FOR A MECHANIC.  I HAVE MADE A CONNECTION TO HOT WEATHER AND THE CAR'S AIR CONDITIONING BEING ON.  I FEAR THIS IS NOT SAFE.",
