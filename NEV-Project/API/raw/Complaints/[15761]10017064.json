ALL SERVICE WAS PERFORMED  BY CHEVROLET DEALERS. AFTER EACH SERVICE I HAVE NOTICED A \"GRINDING\" NOISE, FAINT, AT FIRST BUT WORSENS GRADUALLY UNTIL REPLACEMENT. LAST DEALER (SIMMS CHEVROLET ORTONVILLE MICHIGAN) STRONGLY SUGGESTED I CALL GM (WHICH I HAVE ON THE LAST TWO OCCASIONS) BUT THEY CLAIM IT IS NORMAL. I LEASED THE VEHICLE FOR MY WIFE TO DRIVE TO  WORK, BUT SHE WILL NO LONGER DRIVE IT AS SHE IS AFRAID OF A TOTAL FAILURE. *JB",
