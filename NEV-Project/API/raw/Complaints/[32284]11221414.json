FOUND ALSO THAT THE TRANSMISSION QUICK CONNECT WAS LEAKING AND LOST ALL TRANSMISSION FLUID AND NO WARNING LIGHTS TO LET ME KNOW THAT ALL THE FLUID WAS MISSING.

WELL, A DAY LATER STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM OF UPSHIFTING AND DOWNSHIFT AT 3RD TO FOURTH. ALL THE FLUID WAS MISSING AGAIN NO WARNING LIGHTS. I REPLACE LINES AND FUILD AND THE UPSHIFT AND DOWN SHIFT IS GONE BUT NOW HAVE GRINDING OF THE THRID AND FOURTH GEAR.",
