SHE LET IT ROLLED, PULLED OVER AND PARKED ON THE SIDE OF THE STREET. WE DISCOVERED THAT THE MAIN PULLEY BROKE LOOSE AND THE DRIVE BELTS CAME OFF THE ROLLERS DUE TO A BROKEN (SHEARED OFF) BOLT THAT ATTACHED THE PULLEY TO THE CRANKSHAFT. THE CAR HAS ONLY 61K MILES ON IT AND I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TOTALLY PREMATURE. THE BALL HONDA SERVICE REP TOLD US THAT HONDA MOTORS CO. WILL NOT COVER FOR THE REPAIR SINCE THE WARRANTY EXPIRED, BUT THIS IS TOTALLY PREMATURE I THOUGHT, AND MAYBE IT WAS CAUSED BY INFERIOR MATERIAL (BOLT) AND/OR BY POOR QUALITY WORKMANSHIP (OVER-TORQUE'D). THE CAR HAS HAD REGULAR MAINTENANCE SERVICE BY HONDA DEALER AND HAS NO PREVIOUS ENGINE WORK DONE EXCEPT FOR THE MFR RECOMMENDED REGULARLY-SCHEDULED SERVICES.     INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
