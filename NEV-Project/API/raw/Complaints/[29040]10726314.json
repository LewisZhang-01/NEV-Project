        "summary": "I BOUGHT MY FORD FOCUS AS A FORD CERTIFIED CAR ON 04/06/2015. CAR IS USED, HAD APPROXIMATELY 22,000 MILES ON IT.  ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF MAY I STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR SHUTTERING WHEN I WOULD ACCELERATE.   IT BECAME WORSE AND TOOK IT INTO DEALER FOR SERVICE.  THE SERVICE PERSON THAT IT IS THE CLUTCH. HE SAID THAT IT WOULD TAKE 2-3 MONTHS TO GET THE PART AS THE CLUTCH IS ON BACK ORDER DUE TO SO MANY CARS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.  I ASKED WHY I WAS NOT TOLD ABOUT THIS DEFECT WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR. WHY DIDN'T DEALER FIX IT BEFORE SELLING IT.  THE PROBLEM HAS ESCALATED AND I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE AROUND WITH MY GRANDCHILDREN.  I AM ALSO SCARED AS THE SHUTTERING IS AMPLIFIED GOING UP HILL AND WHEN ACCELERATING. I COMPLAINED TO FORD MOTOR BUT THEY HAVE NOT GOTTEN BACK TO ME.  I FEEL THAT I WAS SOLD THE CAR UNDER FALSE CIRCUMSTANCES. IF I HAD KNOWN OF THIS PROBLEM I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT SOMETHING ELSE.  I AM 71, THIS PROBABLY MY LAST CAR AND I CANNOT EVEN ENJOY IT AS AFRAID OF CRASH.  THIS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT.  THERE ARE SO MANY CLUTCHES THAT NEED TO BE REPLACED; WHY NO RECALL??  THE DEALERSHIP HAS NOT FIXED IT AND SAYS THE CAR IS SAFE.  I DO NOT AGREE. THEY SAID THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO UNTIL PART IS IN.",
