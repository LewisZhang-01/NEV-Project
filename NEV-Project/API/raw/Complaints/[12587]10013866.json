IT HAS BEEN LEAKING FOR SOME TIME AND IS NOT NOTICEABLE UNTIL THE WATER STARTS SEEPING FROM UNDER THE CARPET ONCE THE PADDING IS SOAKED. WITH THE HEATER ON, ALL OF THE GLASS BECOMES FOGGED WHICH WILL IMPAIR VISIBILITY UNLESS YOU PUT THE WINDOWS DOWN.  THE PADDING AND CARPET HAS ALSO CAUSED A VERY BAD MILDEW SMELL. DEALERSHIP REFUSES TO REPAIR AND STATES GM WILL ONLY COVER LESS THAN 36,000 MI.  ITS MOST LIKELY THE CRACK OCCURRED BEFORE 36K WITH SO MUCH WATER UNDER THE CARPET BUT NOW AT 57,000 ITS JUST NOTICED. GM MUST BE AWARE THIS IS A MANUFACTURE DEFECT, BUT LIKE MYSELF THERE HOPING MOST CONSUMERS WITH THIS TYPE OF VEHICLE WON'T NOTICE THE PROBLEM UNTIL AFTER THE 36K MI .   *NLM",
