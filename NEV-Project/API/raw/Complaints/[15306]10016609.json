AN ELECTRICAL FIRE OCCURRED IN THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR WHILE PARKED AT WORK,  CONSISTENT WITH NHTSA 03V093000. THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON A US NAVY BASE AND THE NAVY FIRE CHIEF INVESTIGATED THE FIRE. HIS REPORT RULED THE FIRES ORIGIN ELECTRICAL IN THE DRIVERS DOOR. IT'S BEEN SEVERAL YEARS AND I'M NOT SURE OF THE DATE, BUT I CAN CHECK WITH MY INSURANCE COMPANY WHO PAID A $10,000 CLAIM.  NHTSA 03V093000 SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE 1999 MODELS OF THE \"OLD\" BODY STYLE.   I'M WONDERING WHY MY COMPLAINT IS NO LONGER IN YOUR DATABASE.  PLEASE FEE FREE TO CONTACT ME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS NEEDED.       *NLM",
