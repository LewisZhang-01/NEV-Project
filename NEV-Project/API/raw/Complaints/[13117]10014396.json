THIS WAS EVIDENT BECAUSE THE VEHICLE ACCELERATION WAS REDUCED, THERE WAS A SMELL OF HOT BRAKES, THE VEHICLE DID NOT ROLL WHEN ON A HILL WITH THE BRAKES RELEASED, THERE WAS A VIBRATION IN THE STEERING WHEEL, AND THERE WAS REDUCED FREE PLAY IN THE BRAKE PEDAL.  I PULLED OVER AND CHECKED THE FRONT BRAKES, THE RIGHT ONE WAS VERY HOT.  I TAPPED ON THE CALIPER WITH A HITCH PIN THAT WAS AVAILABLE, AFTER WHICH THE VEHICLE WAS DRIVABLE.  I DROVE THE VEHICLE APPROXIMATELY 130 MILES TWO DAYS LATER WITH NO PROBLEMS BUT I DID NOT RUN INTO HEAVY BRAKE USAGE AT THAT TIME.  *JB",
