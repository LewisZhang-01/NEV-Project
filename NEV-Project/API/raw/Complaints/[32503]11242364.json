        "summary": "VEHICLE FAILED TO START, CRANKED CONTINUOUSLY BUT NO FUEL. OUR FLEX HAS A NORMAL ASPIRATED ENGINE. VEHICLES WITH THE ECOBOOST OR TURBO ENGINE HAVE A RECALL ON THE FUEL PUMP ELECTRIC MODULE. I REPLACED THE PART MYSELF AND THE FLEX STARTED IMMEDIATELY. FORTUNATELY, THE VEHICLE FAILED IN THE DRIVEWAY AND NOT DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD FULL OF CHILDREN. THIS COMPONENT SHOULD BE RECALLED ON EITHER ENGINE OPTION ON THE FLEX. THERE ARE NUMEROUS STORIES OF THIS COMPONENT FAILING ON EITHER ENGINE MODEL. IT IS A $50 FIX AND I WOULD URGE ALL FLEX OWNERS TO REPLACE THIS COMPONENT YOURSELVES IF FORD WILL NOT REPLACE IT FOR YOU. FOR LESS THAN A TANK OF FUEL, YOU CAN REPLACE THIS COMPONENT YOURSELF AND AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING STRANDED WITH A VEHICLE THAT STALLS OUT AND WILL NOT RESTART OR SIMPLY FAILS TO START. HAD I BEEN AWARE OF THIS, I WOULD HAVE DONE THIS ASAP. YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHERE THIS FAILURE WILL OCCUR, I.E. ON THE HIGHWAY LATE AT NIGHT. THIS COMPONENT NEEDS TO BE RECALLED REGARDLESS OF THE ENGINE. THE REPLACEMENT PART IS THE SAME FOR BOTH ENGINES.",
