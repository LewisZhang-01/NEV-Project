        "summary": "RIGHT SIDE MIRROR AUTOMATICALLY ADJUSTS WHEN CAR IS IN REVERSE, HOWEVER WHEN YOU GO BACK IN FIRST THE MIRROR DOES NOT RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL SPOT. AUDI HAS SAID THAT THIS IS A SOFTWARE PROBLEM. IT HAS BEEN SEVERAL MONTHS NOW AND THEY HAVE NOT FIXED THE ISSUE.  IT IS A DANGEROUS ISSUE BECAUSE EVERYTIME YOU NEED THAT MIRROR IT IS POINTED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION (USUALLY INTO THE SKY). IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS AND GENERAL DRIVING, THE MIRROR IS NEVER IN THE CORRECT SPOT. I HAVE HAD SOME VERY CLOSE CALLS BECAUSE IN ORDER TO SEE IN THAT VEHICLE YOU NEED THAT RIGHT SIDE MIRROR. I RECENTLY HAD TO SLAM ON THE BRAKES AT 65MPH ON THE FREEWAY BECAUSE A GUY CUT ME OFF, I COULD HAVE EASILY MOVED INTO THE OTHER LANE BUT BECAUSE THE MIRROR WAS POINTED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION, THIS WAS NOT AN OPTION. WHEN I SLAMMED THE BRAKES THE BUY BEHIND ME SLAMMED HIS AND SLIDE RIGHT BY ME NARROWLY BASHING MY BACK BUMPER.  THE WHOLE THING COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THE MIRROR WORKED.  THERE ARE OTHERS WITH THE SAME CAR THAT HAVE THE SAME COMPLAINT.  AUDI AGAIN HAS SAID IT IS A SOFTWARE ISSUE HOWEVER THEY HAVE NOT FIXED IT.  IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION AND AN ACCIDENT(S) IS WAITING TO HAPPEN. THANKS",
