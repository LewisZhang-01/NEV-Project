        "summary": "I AM HAVING A PROBLEM WITH MY 2002 MINI COOPER, IT IS EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSMISSION AND IT HAS BEEN IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT IN THREE SEPARATE OCCASION TOTALLYING 54 DAYS, THE LAST TIME THAT IT WAS IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT IT WAS 40 DAYS. THEY FINALLY SAID THE PROBLEM WAS CORRECTED, BUT IT TOOK THEM THAT LONG TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS WRONG.   I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND TOLD THEM THAT I WANTED TO BE COMPENSATED ONLY FOR THE DAYS THE CAR WAS AT THEIR SHOP, ALSO I INFORMED THEM THAT IF THE MINI HAS TO BE TAKEN TO THE SHOP AGAIN, THAT WILL FORCE ME TO ENFORCE THE LEMON LAW.  MELISSA STEFFY, THE GENERAL MANAGER, SAID FOR ME TO SEND HER THE LETTER AND SHE WIL SEE WHAT SHE CAN DO, BUT THAT IT WAS UNLIKELY THAT THEY WOULD COMPENSATE FOR ANYTHING.  I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR BECAUSE I PURCHASED THE CAR TO USE IT, NOT FOR THEM TO HAVE IT IN THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT.    I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD ASSIST ME WITH THIS MATTER.     THANKS LEYDA RAMOS FOR EDID BATISTA : LRMIA@AOL.COM",
