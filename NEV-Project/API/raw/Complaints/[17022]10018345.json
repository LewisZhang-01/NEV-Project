ONE YEAR LATER AND UNDER 30,000 MILES THE NEW ENGINE HAS BLOWN A HEAD GASKET AND FORD REFUSES TO HONOR IT STATING THAT A SMALL PIN HOLE IN ONE OF THE HEATER HOSES CAUSED THE BLOCK TO DRAIN OF FLUID AND BLOWING THE HEAD GASKET.    I INSPECTED THE ENGINE SHORTLY AFTER IT OCCURRED AND THE RADIATOR AND RESERVE TANKS WERE BOTH FULL.  I TOLD THIS TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE DEALER AND I WAS TOLD I MUST BE MISTAKEN THE ENGINE WAS EMPTY.  I AM AN AIRCRAFT MECHANIC AND KNOW WHEN AN ENGINE IS OUT OF WATER OR NOT BUT I AM RUNNING INTO A BRICK WALL.  I HAVE CONTACTED THE FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND AM NOT HAVING ANY LUCK WITH THAT EITHER.  *JB    WHAT RECOURSE IF ANY DO I HAVE?",
