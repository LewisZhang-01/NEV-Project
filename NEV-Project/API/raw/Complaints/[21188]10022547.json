THE MANUFACTURER INSTRUCTED THE CONSUMER TO GO TO THE DEALER WHERE THEY CHECKED THE ALIGNMENT AND FOUND THAT IT WAS OFF BY 3 1/2 INCHES OUT OF LINE.  (NEMAR HAD THE FRAME CUT BETWEEN THE FRONT REAR WHEEL TO SHORTEN THE FRAME FOR A 34' RV)  WHEN THEY WELDED IT BACK TO THE RIGHT SIDE, IT WAS 3/4 INCHES LONGER THAN THE LEFT SIDE.  THE DEALER STATED THAT IT COULD NOT BE FIXED.  (THE MANUFACTURER COULDN'T FIX EITHER)  THE MANUFACTURER REFERRED THE CONSUMER TO A DEALER WHERE THEY REPLACED 2 REAR SPRINGS.  THE MANUFACTURER TACKED A 38 INCH PLATE WITH A HOLE FOR A SPRING CENTER BOLT.  THE RIGHT REAR AXLE HAS PULLED FORWARD 3/4 INCH AND CORRECTED THE TRACKING.  THE CONSUMER WAS CONCERNED  THE PLATE MAY BREAK LOOSE FROM THE SPRING PERCH AND CAUSE THE AXLE TO MOVE FORWARD AND BACKWARD.  *SCC   *JB",
