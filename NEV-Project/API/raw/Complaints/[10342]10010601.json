GM AND DEALERSHIP KEEP MAKING EXCUSES OF THE PROBLEM AND THE ODOR.  I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE IN OVER 7 TIMES IN 3 YEARS FOR THE ODOR AND LEAKING FUEL.  THIS HAS TAKEN ME AWAY FROM WORK AND NUMEROUS HOURS IN SCHEDULING FOR REPAIRS.  I AM CONSTANTLY WORRIED ABOUT MY SAFETY IN THIS VEHICLE.  I AM CURRENTLY IN A LAW SUIT WITH GM.   *NLM",
