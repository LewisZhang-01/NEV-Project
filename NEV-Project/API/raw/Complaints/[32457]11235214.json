        "summary": "IN JANUARY 2019, MY JEEP BEGAN JERKING DURING ACCELERATION.  THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT NOTIFIED ME THAT THE ENGINE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  DURING REMOVAL OF THE ENGINE, THE ALTERNATOR WAS DAMAGED AND HAD TO BE REPLACED AS WELL.  TWO MONTHS LATER I RECEIVED MY VEHICLE BACK AND 10 MILES LATER THE SAME JERK OCCURRED.  AFTER IMMEDIATELY RETURNING TO THE DEALERSHIP AND A RIDE ALONG WITH THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN, THE TECHNICIAN INFORMED ME THAT THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO BE THE TRANSMISSION.  THIS REPAIR TOOK ANOTHER TWO WEEKS.  AT WHICH TIME THE FCC REPRESENTATIVE INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE THEY COULD DO.  THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN EVEN MENTIONED THAT THE VEHICLE SHOULD BE RECALLED AND HAS HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS.  NOW, THREE MONTHS LATER, THE SHIFTER LIGHT HAS COME ON UPON CRANKING THE VEHICLE.  WHICH IS ALSO TRANSMISSION RELATED.  WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS VEHICLE IS NOT SAFE FOR CONSUMERS?",
