THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT WORK MOST OF THE TIME, OCCASIONALLY WORK INTERMITTENTLY, AND  THE FEW TIMES THEY DO WORK, WILL STOP IN MID-CYCLE BLOCKING VIEW THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.   GMC HAS RECALLED ALL JIMMYS FROM 1993-1997 WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. HOWEVER, THEY HAVE NOT INCLUDED THE 1998 IN THE SAME RECALL. I CHECKED THE CERTIFICATE ON MY DOOR - MY CAR WAS MANUFACTURED IN 02/1998.  THIS PROBLEM IS CREATING A SAFETY CONCERN FOR MY DAUGHTER AND I WHILE IN THE CAR. I LIVE IN FLORIDA WHERE IT RAINS DAILY DURING THE SUMMER.   I CALLED GMC ON 5/12/03 TO CHECK INTO THE RECALL ON THE 1993-1997 JIMMY'S. I SPOKE TO TWO CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES. THE SECOND ONE, [XXX], NOTED MY CONCERN, BUT STATED \"YOUR VEHICLE IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS RECALL\"  I REPLIED \"WELL, WHO DO I CALL WHEN THIS ISSUE CAUSES A CAR ACCIDENT WITH ME & MY DAUGHTER?\" HER RESPONSE WAS \"CALL GMC CUSTOMER SERVICE\"  - SHE WAS VERY RUDE AND DID NOT HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM.   THIS PROBLEM OCCURS ALMOST EVERY TIME IT RAINS. IT ALSO OCCURS WHEN I ATTEMPT TO USE THE WINDSHIELD WASHER FLUID - THE FLUID WILL SPRAY BUT THE WIPERS WILL NOT COME ON.  *JB    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
