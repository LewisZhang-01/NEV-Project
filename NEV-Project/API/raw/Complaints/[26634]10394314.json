IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY WITH THE NEED TO GET OUT OF THE CAR FAST YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO EXIT. THE ONLY FIX IS REPLACING THE ENTIRE DOOR PANEL WITH IS OVER $500. BUT THE PROBLEM WOULD NOT BE FIXED SINCE IT WOULD JUST BE PUTTING THE EXACT DOOR PANEL BACK ON. 3 OF MY DOOR PANELS ARE EITHER BROKEN OR CRACKED. I'VE FOUND WEBSITE WHERE LOTS OF PEOPLE WITH THIS SAME YEAR MODEL HAVE THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. MY JEEP HAS NOT BEEN MISTREATED. THE PLASTIC BEHIND THE HANDLE BROKE IN TO MANY PIECES WHEN I JUST WENT TO OPEN THE DOOR.  *TR",
