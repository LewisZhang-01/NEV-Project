        "summary": "2007 JEEP COMMANDER.  SIX MONTHS AFTER THE PURCHASE OF A NEW JEEP COMMANDER THE JEEP STARTED LOSING POWER AND STALLING.  IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT SPEED THE JEEP WAS GOING.  IT HAS STALLED AND LOST POWER AND ALL ELECTRONICS PULLING INTO TRAFFIC AND CRUISING DOWN THE INTERSTATE.  THE JEEP WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE THE JUNCTION BOX WAS REPLACED.  NUMEROUS TESTS WERE COMPLETED BUT NO DEFINITIVE REASON WAS FOUND FOR THE STALLING.  I WAS TOLD THE JEEP WAS FIXED.  THE JEEP HAS SINCE STALLED 3 MORE TIMES, ONE TIME WITH WHEN MY WIFE WAS DRIVING AND MY DAUGHTERS AGES 4 AND 7 WERE ONBOARD.  THIS TIME, THEY WERE NEARLY HIT BY A TRACTOR TRAILER PULLING OUT OF THE LOCAL GROCERY STORE.  THE JEEP HAD TO BE TOWED BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE IT SITS RIGHT NOW.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT SEEMS TO THINK IT'S THE IGNITION SWITCH BUT I  KNOW BETTER.  I'M SEEKING A LEASE BUY OUT BY CHRYSLER AND PLAN TO SUE IF THEY DO NOT TAKE THE JEEP BACK.  THIS JEEP IS GOING TO KILL SOMEONE AND I WILL NOT LET IT BE MY WIFE OR CHILDREN.  *TR",
