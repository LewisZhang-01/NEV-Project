THEY SAY IT IS BECAUSE IT HAS THE BODY OF A VAN BUT THE BRAKING SYSTEM IS DESIGNED FOR THAT OF A MIDSIZE CAR. AND BECAUSE IT IS FRONT WHEEL DRIVE ALL THE WEIGHT AND FORCE RESTS ON THE BRAKING SYSTEM.     I FIND THIS APPALLING!! I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS MANY PROBLEMS WITH ANY OTHER VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE FIRST TIME I HAD TO HAVE THIS WORK DONE, THE VAN WAS ONLY ABOUT 8 MONTHS OLD AND THE \"BRAKE WORK\" DID NOT FALL UNDER WARRANTY.  THE RIGHT ROTOR WAS REPLACED AS WELL AS THE CALIBERS.     THE LAST TIME I HAD IT DONE THE MECHANIC KEPT SAYING, \"YOUR CALIBERS ARE STICKING AND THEY AFFECT THE ROTOR AND HAD TO REPLACE THE ONE ON THE LEFT SIDE.\"",
