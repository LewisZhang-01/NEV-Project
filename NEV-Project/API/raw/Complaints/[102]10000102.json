        "summary": "MY VEHICLE IS A 1997 VOLVO 850R, I'M THE SECOND OWNER OF THE VEHICLE. THE VOLVO IS A SOILD CAR BUT THE 850 SERIES HAVE A DEFECT WITH THE ABS/TRACS MODULE, THIS SETS A CODE ON YOUR OBDII AND IT CLEARS WHEN YOU RESTART THE CAR. THE ISSUE AT HAND IS THAT IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE THE CONTROL MODULE SEES A FAULT AND DEACTIVATES THE ABS/TRACS CONTROL MODULE AND YOU NO LONGER HAVE AN ABS ON THE VEHICLE AND IT'S VERY DANGEROUS IF IT'S RAINING, SNOWING OR A SUDDEN STOP ON THE FREEWAY. THE WHEELS WILL LOCK GIVING YOU A GREATER CHANCE TO CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. SO FAR I'VE BEEN LUCKY, I SPOKE TO THE VOLVO DEALER DIRECTLY TO SEE IF THEY CAN CHANGE THIS UNIT UNDER THE VOLVO VIP WARRANTY AND I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS NOT COVERED AND THE NEW UNIT COST AROUND $600.00 WITHOUT LABOR.  I FEEL THAT VOLVO SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IN CHANGING THIS ABS/TRACS CONTROL MODULE, LOT'S OF VOLVO 850'S AND S70 OWNERS HAVE CHANGED THIS PART WITH VEHICLES IN THE 40,000 TO 60,000 MILE RANGE. THE CAUSE IT'S A HAIR LINE FRACTURE ON THE CIRCUIT BOARD THAT SETS THE FAULT, TOO ME THAT SOUNDS LIKE A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT AND BAD QA CONTROL.  I HOPE THAT THIS COMPLANIT WILL NOT JUST GET PUSHED ASIDE AND HOLD VOLVO LIABLE FOR THIS SINCE IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE.  THE REASON WHY I BOUGHT A VOLVO IS BEACUSE SAFETY IS THEIR #1 PRODUCT.",
