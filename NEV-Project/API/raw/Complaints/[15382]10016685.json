        "summary": "IN JULY 1998 I HAD AN ELECTRICAL FIRE WHILE ON THE INTERSTATE.  THE SMOKE WAS SO INTENSE I HAD TO ROLL DOWN THE WINDOW AND HOLD MY HEAD OUT IN ORDER TO SEE THE ROAD AND STOP THE VEHICLE. THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED A CRASH.  I LOST THE USE OF MY DRIVER SIDE ELECTRICAL SEAT MOTORS AND THE AUTOMATIC DOOR LOCKS. HAMPTON ROADS BATTERY IN HAMPTON VIRGINIA (AUTO ELECTRICAL SHOP) DIAGNOSED THE CAUSE.  CAUSE: THE DRIVER SEATS HAS A SPRING SUPPORT SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWS THE SEAT TO TRAVEL UP AND DOWN. APPARENTLY WHEN A PERSON IS SITTING IN THE DRIVER SEAT THIS SEAT TRAVEL TOUCHES THIS WIRE.  AFTER THREE YEARS OF DRIVING THIS CONTACT ERODED THE WIRE PROTECTION COVERING CAUSING AN ELECTRICAL SHORT.  THE TRUCK ELECTRICAL SYSTEM HAS AUTOMATIC RESETTING CIRCUIT BREAKERS.  EACH TIME THE SEAT CAUSED A SHORT, THE CIRCUIT WOULD HEAT UP AND SHORT AND THEN RESET.  THIS PROCESS CONTINUES UNTIL THE ELECTRICAL WIRING GOT SO HOT IS CAUSED A FIRE IN THE WIRING HARNESS UNDER THE DASH.  IF YOU WANT MORE DETAIL PLEASE FILL FREE TO.    *JB",
