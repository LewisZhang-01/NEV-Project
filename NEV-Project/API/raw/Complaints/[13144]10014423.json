I COMPLAINED OF A BLUE SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE TAIL PIPE, BUT THE OWNER OF THE STORE TOLD ME IT WAS NORMAL FOR BMW'S.   THE TAILLIGHT BROKE ON THE BIKE AND WERE REPLACED BY BMW, BUT I WAS TOLD BY THE OWNER THAT I COULD NOT CLAIM ANY OTHER PROBLEMS ON THE MOTORCYCLE.  BMW HAS OFFERED TO PAY FOR HALF OF THE LABOR COST TO REPAIR THE BIKE, BUT NOT THE FULL COST. THE CURRENT NEW OWNER OF THE SHOP SAID THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF UNDER WARRANTY BY THE OLD OWNER. *JB",
