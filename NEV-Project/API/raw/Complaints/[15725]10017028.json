        "summary": "THE SRS LIGHT ON OUR 1997 HONDA EX-V6 MODEL WILL NOT GO OFF.  WE COMPLAINED TO THE DEALER, WILLEY HONDA, (WHERE THE AUTOMOBILE WAS PURCHASED NEW AND ALL SERVICE WORK HAS BEEN DONE) AND THEY SIMPLY TURNED THE LIGHT OFF SAYING THERE MUST BE A \"SHORT\" IN THE LIGHT. THE FIRST COMPLAINT WAS BEFORE THE WARRANTY WAS UP ON THE VEHICLE.  SEVERAL TIMES SINCE WHEN IT HAS COME BACK ON - THEY WOULD TURN IT OFF.  NOW THEY ARE TELLING US IT MUST BE THE COMPUTER SYSTEM AND THEY WANT US TO PAY $750.+ TO HAVE IT REPAIRED PROPERLY AS THE AIR BAGS MIGHT NOT BE WORKING RIGHT!  WE FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND THEY SHOULD HAVE TAKEN CARE OF THE PROBLEM THE FIRST TIME INSTEAD OF \"GUESSING\". THIS SHOULD NOT BE OUR PROBLEM NO MATTER HOW MANY MILES ARE ON THE CAR!  WE ARE, NOW, AFRAID TO DRIVE IT IN CASE THEY INFLATE WHEN THEY \"SHOULDN'T\" OR WHEN THEY \"SHOULD\". I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE HONDA AND THEY SAID THE WARRANTY WAS UP AND I WOULD NEED TO PAY.  I JUST HEARD ABOUT YOUR AGENCY OR I WOULD HAVE CONTACTED YOU WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENED!  THANKS SO MUCH FOR WHATEVER YOU CAN DO FOR ME! THERE ISN'T REALLY AN \"INCIDENT DATE\" BUT THE PROGRAM WOULDN'T LET ME GO ON WITHOUT A \"DATE\".  I PUT THE DATE THE \"NEWS OF THE COST\" WAS GIVEN TO ME AT WILLEY HONDA! *JB",
