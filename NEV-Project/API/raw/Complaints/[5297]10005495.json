MY MECHANIC DICUSSED MY PROBLEM WITH OTHER MECHANICS AND THE TOLD HIM THAT THE 2.7 LIT ENGINE IN THE INTREPID HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS FOR MOST INTREPID OWNERS.  MY CAR WAS FULL OF OIL AND I ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE SERVICE SCHUEDULE.  RIGHT NOW I AM REBUILDING THE ENGINE THAT HAS A BAD BEARING, HAS A CRACKED CAM SHAFT AND ALSO THREW A PISTON.  THE REBUILDER HAS NO EXPLINATION AS TO WHAT WENT WRONG BUT THAT HE WORKS ON THESE ENGINES MORE THAN HE SHOULD BECAUSE THEY ARE SO NEW.  BY THE WAY MY CAR HAS 80,000 MILES ON IT AND DID'NT MAKE A SOUND UNTIL THIS HAPENED.",
