        "summary": "THREE OUT OF FOUR IGNITION COILS IN MY 2002 VW PASSAT HAVE FAILED.  VW STATES THAT THIS IS NOT A MAJOR PROBLEM.  I BELIEVE IT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM BECAUSE WHEN THE FIRST TWO WENT I WAS DRIVING THE CAR ON ROUTE 128 AND HAD TO GET OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO STOP BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME DECREASE IN POWER.  WE WAITED TWO WEEKS TO GET THE CAR BACK AND THE THIRD COIL WENT LESS THAN 48 HOURS LATER.  I NOW HAVE ONE MORE COIL TO GO BAD AND I FIND THAT I NO LONGER DRIVE MY VW BECAUSE OF THAT.  I FEAR THAT MY 60 MILE A DAY COMMUTE INTO WORK WILL FIND ME ON THE SIDE OF THE MASS TURNPIKE INSTEAD OF DRIVING ON IT.  THERE SEEMS TO BE QUITE THE NUMBER OF VW & AUDI MOTOR VEHCILE THAT ARE HAVING THIS PROBLEM BUT VW DEEMS IT NOT TO BE OF IMPORTANCE FOR THE THE PEACE OF MIND OF THEIR CAR OWNERS.  I WILL NOW NEED TO WAIT FOR THIS COIL TO FAIL BEFORE VW WILL FINALLY REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE COIL STILL RESIDING IN MY CAR.",
