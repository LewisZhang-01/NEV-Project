I SPOKE TO SERVICE ADVISOR AT AIRPARK CHRYSLER/JEEP THAT SAID HE HAD NEVER HEARD/SEEN THAT BEFORE AND THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO TO HELP ME.I HAVE RESEARCHED ON THE INTERNET FOR RECALLS AND IT APPEARS THAT JEEP IS NOT WILLING TO RECALL THIS MAJOR VEHICLE SAFETY ISSUE WITH HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME DEFECTIVE PLASTIC DOOR HANDLES.  *TR",
