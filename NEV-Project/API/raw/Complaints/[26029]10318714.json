IT IS VERY UNSAFE ON THE HIGHWAY AS IT DOES NOT GET UP TO OR MAINTAIN SPEEDS. FILED A COMPLAINT WITH TOYOTA WITH NO RESPONSE. TOYOTA SAID THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WITH IT WHEN I TOOK IT IN TO GET LOOKED AT, BUT IT WAS SLIPPING THE WHOLE DRIVE HOME AND SINCE THEN. I BELIEVE THERE IS A DEFINITE PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT BELIEVES THIS, HOW MANY PEOPLE MUST COMPLAIN OR DOES SOMEONE HAVE TO DIE FOR THEM TO TAKE SOME ACTION? *TR",
