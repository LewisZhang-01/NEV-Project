I INFORMED THE PEOPLE I WAS WITH THAT I WAS GOING TO DRIVE TO THE MAIN ROAD. BEFORE I GOT THERE, ABOUT 50 FEET, THE WHOLE VEHICLE WAS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE FLAMES WENT OVER THE TOP OF THE JEEP. LUCKILY THE FLAMES DIED DOWN BRIEFLY ENOUGH FOR ME TO JUMP OUT . I LOST EVERYTHING IN THE JEEP AND THE JEEP ITSELF. UPON CONTACTING JEEP, THEY SAID IT WASN'T THEIR FAULT RATHER IT WAS MY FAULT. CLEARLY SOMETHING MALFUNCTIONED AND I ALMOST LOST MY LIFE.   *TR",
