        "summary": "THERE IS A SAFETY RECALL ON MY 1997 FORD F150, 98V161000, RELATING TO FRACTURED LEAF SPRING. ACCORDING TO FORD, THIS SAFETY RECALL WAS APPLIED TO MY VEHICLE IN 2001.  I HEARD A NOISE FROM THE BACK OF MY TRUCK WHEN STARTING FROM A STOPPED POSITION, AND BEGAN LOOKING AROUND. I SEE THAT THE CENTER LEAF SPRING ON THE REAR OF MY TRUCK IS BROKEN, EXACTLY THE PROBLEM THAT IS DESCRIBED IN THE SAFETY RECALL 98V161000 (98S18 PER FORD).  I CONTACTED THE LOCAL FORD DEALER. THEY SHOW NO OUTSTANDING CAMPAIGNS AGAINST MY VIN. AFTER ABOUT 5 ATTEMPTS TO GET SOMEONE AT FORD TO EXPLAIN THIS RECALL TO ME, I FINALLY GOT IN TOUCH WITH FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND SPOKE WITH A REPRESENTATIVE NAMED TISHA.  SHE INFORMED ME THAT THIS RECALL HAD BEEN APPLIED TO MY VEHICLE BY LEIGH FORD, AND THAT FORD WILL NOT COVER THIS REPAIR.  I HAVE TWO COMPLAINTS.  1. SAFETY CONCERN. THE LEAF SPRING IS BROKEN, AND MAY CONTACT THE FUEL TANK AND CAUSE A LEAK AS DESCRIBED.  FORD DID NOT SEEM CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. WAS THIS RECALL APPLIED CORRECTLY? WAS THE FRACTURE THERE TO BEGIN WITH, AND JUST OVERLOOKED? I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS SAFE TO EVEN DRIVE THIS UNTIL THIS IS REPAIRED.  2. THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM AND FORD SHOULD PAY TO HAVE THIS SAFETY ISSUE REPAIRED CORRECTLY AND IMMEDIATELY.     *NLM",
