PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE TORQUE CONVERTER PRESSURE IS NOT ENOUGH TO ENGAGE THE HIGHER GEAR. FORD DEALER RECOMMENDED TRANSMISSION FLUID CHANGE TO FIX THE PROBLEM , BUT IT STILL EXISTS. I ASKED ANOTHER REPAIR DEALERSHIP WHAT IT COULD BE ,THEY RECOMMEND CHANGING THE TORQUE CONVERTER,THE FLUID CHANGE WILL NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM. THEY NEED TO GO BACK ON THE DAY IT WAS STILL COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND REPLACE THE TORQUE CONVERTER UNDER WARRANTY.    *JB",
