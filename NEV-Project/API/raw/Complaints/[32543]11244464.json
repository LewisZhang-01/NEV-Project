        "summary": "THE VEHICLE WILL NOT START SOMETIMES (THE STARTER CRANKS BUT WON'T START) BUT THEN STARTS A FEW MINUTES LATER AND YOU HAVE NO CLUE WHY, AND SOMETIMES THE LIGHTS COME ON WHILE PARKED AT THE HOUSE AND THEN TURN OFF.  OTHER TIMES THE VEHICLE CRANKS UP BUT WILL NOT START AND AFTER RELEASING THE BUTTON IT KEEPS CRANKING UP FOR ABOUT 20 SECONDS?  SOUNDS LIKE SOME PROBLEM WITH THE FIRMWARE FOR THE TOTALLY INTEGRATED POWER MODULE (TIPM) WHICH IS THE GATEWAY OR DISTRIBUTION BOX FOR NEARLY THE ENTIRE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IN LATE-MODEL CHRYSLER PRODUCTS.  BECAUSE OF THE INTERMITTENT NATURE (I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING THIS OVER MORE THAN 6 MONTHS AND IT WILL NOT REPEAT AT MY MECHANICS LOCATION) IT IS VERY HARD TO DIAGNOSE TOTALLY.  THE ENGINE SEEMS TO BE STARTING TO RUN A LITTLE ROUGHER THAN IT USED TO ALSO.  I HAVE OVER 125,000 MILES WITH THE VEHICLE AND IT HAS ALWAYS WORKED GREAT UNTIL THIS INTERMITTENT PROBLEM STARTED.  I ALSO WAKE UP MY NEIGHBORS AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE NIGHT WHEN THE HORN STARTS GOING OFF AT RANDOM TIMES.  THIS ONE PROBLEM HAS BEEN OCCURRING SINCE THE CAR HAD ABOUT 20,000 MILES AND I ATTRIBUTED IT TO THE KEY FOB BUT I AM NOT SO SURE.  I HAVE TALKED TO CHRYSLER WHO KEEPS TELLING ME THAT THERE IS NO RECALL SO IF I GO IN I HAVE TO PAY TO GET IT FIXED WHILE I THINK IT IS AN ENGINEERING DESIGN PROBLEM THAT SHOULD BE FIXED AT NO COST.  THE DATE BELOW REFLECTS THE LATEST INSTANCE BUT IT HAS HAPPENED A LOT DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS.",
