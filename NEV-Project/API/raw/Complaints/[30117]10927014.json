WE DROVE HOME; THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO DEALERSHIP,  & THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE BODY WAS REPAIRED. ON 11-15-16 THE SAME THING HAPPENED, BUT THIS TIME WE WERE IN DALLAS ON HIGHWAY 289 IN AN INTERIOR LANE AT 55 MPH. WE SLOWED TO 2 MPH, BUT REACHED A PARKING LOT. FORD DEALER THEN REPLACED THE THROTTLE BODY AND MOTOR ASSEMBLY.  FORD KNOWS OF THE THROTTLE ISSUE, AND ONLY REPLACES IT AFTER THE SECOND MALFUNCTION. THIS POLICY PUTS ALL EDGE DRIVERS AT RISK AND SHOULD BE CHANGED TO REPLACE THEM IMMEDIATELY.",
