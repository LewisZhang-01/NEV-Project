AFTER REVIEWING YOUR WEBSITE COMPLAINTS, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT NHTSA IS THINKING, I'M GUESSING THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN KILLED YET, THEREFORE THE DELAY IN CALLING A RECALL.  FROM WHAT I'VE READ, I CAN LOOK FORWARD TO DOING THIS AGAIN IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE.  ONLY HAVE 75,000 MILES, ORIGINAL OWNER AND THOUGHT I WAS DRIVING ONE OF THE SAFEST VEHICLES ON THE ROAD.  SILLY ME",
