        "summary": "REF.: 2002 FORD ESCAPE   ON JULY 22 THE CAR WAS IN THE DRIVEWAY, NOT RUNNING, MY SON WAS WASHING IT. IT STARTED BILLOWING SMOKE FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT WITHOUT CAUSE. HE LIFTED THE HOOD, WATERED DOWN THE AREA THAT WAS BURNING. IT STARTED AND WE PUT IT IN THE GARAGE. THE NEXT MORNING MY WIFE ENTERED OUR GARAGE, AT ABOUT 7:00 AM, THE GARAGE WAS ENGULFED IN SMOKE WITH A SMELL OF BURNT RUBBER. I DROVE THE FORD OUT ON TO THE DRIVE WAY. NOW IT MALFUNCTIONED, THE ABS AND ENGINE CHECK LIGHT WERE ON.   I SEARCHED THE INTERNET. WHEN I TYPED IN 'SMOKE COMING FOR THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT OF A 2002 FORD ESCAPE' IT SENT ME TO A NHTSA WEBSITE WHERE LISTED WERE MANY 2002 FORD ESCAPES THAT HAD FOR NO REASON CAUGHT FIRE. THE PROBLEM STATED WAS THE ABS BRAKE SYSTEM WITH RECALLS ON THIS YEAR, MAKE AND MODEL OF FORD. I CONTACTED THE DEALER AND WAS INFORMED THAT FORD ESCAPES HAD NO PROBLEMS AND NOT ON A RECALL LIST. I LATER CALLED THEM BACK AND GAVE THEM A RECALL NUMBER. I WAS ADVISED THAT HIS WAS NOT ONE OF THE VEHICLES COVERED BY THAT RECALL. I CALLED MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND THEY SUGGESTED A DIAGNOSIS BY LOCAL FORD DEALER TO DETERMINE PROBLEM. I HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALER AND IT WAS THE ABS BRAKE SYSTEM.  MY WIFE IS NOW AFRAID OF IT, BECAUSE IT IS DANGEROUS AND AFRAID IT WILL BURST INTO FLAMES.  I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM FORD MOTOR COMPANY OFFICE OF THE GENERAL COUNSEL CLAIMS DEPARTMENT P.O BOX 70, DEARBORN, MICHIGAN 48121-0070 WHERE I AN DIRECTED TO PERFORM A FULL COMPLETE INVESTIGATION FOR THEM WITH PICTURES OF THE ENTIRE VEHICLE, DAMAGED PARTS, COPY OF PINK SLIP, REGISTRATION, COMPLETE ACCOUNT OF INCIDENT, REPAIR RECEIPTS OR ESTIMATES AND LETTER OF DENIAL OF THE INSURANCE COMPANY CLAIM. IF THE INSURANCE COMPANY SETTLES THE CLAIM THEY WILL NOT COVER THE VEHICLE. I HAVE 90 DAYS TO RESPOND BEFORE THEY CLOSE THE CASE.   MY INSURANCE COMPANY STATES THEY WILL ONLY REPAIR WHAT BURNT AND NOT GET MY VEHICLE TO FUNCTION AS IT DID PRIOR TO IT CATCHING FIRE. *TR",
