EMISSIONS CENTER NOTED CHRYSLER SERVICE BULLETIN 18-10-00 AND SUGGESTED DEALER SERVICE FOR \"RE-FLASHING\" AT OWNER EXPENSE.  I HAD ATTEMPTED TO BE PROACTIVE BEFORE TESTING UPON HEARING OF OTHER COMPLAINTS ON SAME ISSUE BY CONTACTING CHRYSLER AND ALEXANDER DODGE (DEALER).  CHRYSLER INITIALLY DENIED KNOWLEDGE OF ANY EMISSIONS PROBLEMS.  AFTER THE DEALER CONFIRMED A PROBLEM AND STATED THERE IS ONLY A 50/50 CHANCE THE VAN WILL PASS EMISSIONS AND AFTER I OBTAINED THE SERVICE BULLETIN #, ONLY THEN DID CHRYSLER SAY THERE WAS AN ISSUE BUT THEY REFUSED TO TELL ME ABOUT IT UNLESS I PROVIDED THEM WITH A VISA OR MASTERCARD NUMBER.  I AM AMAZED THAT CHRYSLER IS NOT STANDING BY THEIR PRODUCT OR CUSTOMERS.  THEY WANT ME TO PAY THEM SO THEY CAN TELL ME ABOUT THEIR PROBLEM WITH THEIR VEHICLE AND THEN THEY WANT ME TO PAY THEM TO FIX THEIR PROBLEM.  IF CHRYSLER KNOWS THERE IS A PROBLEM, THE DEALER KNOWS THERE IS A PROBLEM, AND CUSTOMERS CANNOT GET EMISSIONS TESTING OR RENEW VEHICLE TAGS, THEN WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT CHRYSLER NOT ASSISTING THE CONSUMER?*AK",
