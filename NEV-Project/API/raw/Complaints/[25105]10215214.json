WHEN I CAME OUT OF THE STORE TO GO HOME, THE IGNITION WOULD NOT TURN.  IT WAS FROZEN SO THE KEY COULD NOT MOVE IT AT ALL.  AS A RESULT, I WAS STUCK AT A STORE. I CALLED RELATIVES AND WE ARRANGED FOR A TOW TRUCK TO TAKE IT TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP.  THE IGNITION CYLINDER WAS REPLACED AND WE WERE BILLED $339.00 FOR THE REPAIR.        I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS TYPE OF FAILURE ON ANY VEHICLE YET IT IS SUPPOSEDLY A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE FORD FOCUS.  *TR",
