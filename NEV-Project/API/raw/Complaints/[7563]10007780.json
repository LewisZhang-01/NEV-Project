STEERING WHEEL WOULD \"CATCH\" AND MAKE THUMPING NOISES AS WE TURNED RIGHT OR LEFT SHARP TURNS (SLOWLY).  BRAKES ARE GOING TO CAUSE AN ACCIDENT SOONER OR LATER AS THE PEDAL GOES COMPLETELY TO THE FLOOR AND THUMPS LOUDLY BUT DOES NOT SLOW THE VEHICLE WHEN YOU TRY TO MAKE A MODERATELY SUDDEN STOP.  WE HAD OUR TRUCK IN FOR SERVICE AFTER OWNING IT FOR 3 WEEKS AND THE IDIOTS AT SPITZER CHEVROLET TRIED TO TELL US IT WAS THE TRAILER HITCH MAKING ALL THE NOISE.....WHAT A JOKE",
