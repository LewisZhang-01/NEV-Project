I WAS ABLE TO MANEUVER THE VEHICLE OFF THE ROAD JUST BEFORE THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED UP & THE VEHICLE WENT DEAD.  HAD IT TOWED INTO DEALERSHIP, WAS TOLD THE TRANSMISSION HAD FAILED & WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED.  ISSUES CAUSED FROM FAULTY RADIATOR  DRAINAGE INTO TRANSMISSION FLUID.  I HAVE READ OF COUNTLESS OTHER REPORTS OF THIS SAME ISSUE.  THIS YEAR VEHICLE SHOULD BE RECALLED BY DEALERSHIP TO CORRECT THIS RECURRING PROBLEM.  IT WONT BE LONG BEFORE SOMEONE LOSES CONTROL OF THEIR VEHICLE DUE TO FAILED TRANSMISSION & HITS ANOTHER VEHICLE OR KILLS SOMEONE!  *TR",
