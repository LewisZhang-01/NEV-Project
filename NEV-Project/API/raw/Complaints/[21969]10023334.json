THIS WILL CAUSE ENGINE NOISE, POOR PERFORMANCE AND/OR STALLS WITH NO ENGINE RE-START.  THIS IS NOT A RECALL.  DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE HAS THE CONDITION AS DESCRIBED ABOVE\".  I FEEL THAT THIS IS IRRESPONSIBLE BY CHEVROLET AND THE ACTION THEY ARE TAKING IS ALSO IRRESPONSIBLE.  THEY ARE COVERING THE VEHICLE FOR 7 YEARS OR 100,000 MILES.  PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AND MAKE CHEVROLET CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  IF THEY KNOW THEY ARE PUTTING A FAULTY PRODUCT ON THE MARKET THEY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.
