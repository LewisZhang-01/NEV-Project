AS REPORTED BY NUMEROUS OTHERS ON THIS WEB SITE, TOYOTA DOES NOT COVER THE COST TO REPAIR THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE THEY HAVE FIXED THE PROBLEM ON LATER MODEL 1995 3.0L V6. BECAUSE VEHICLE WAS MANUFACTURED IN NOVEMBER 1995 IT IS NOT COVERED. THE DEFECT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THOSE MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO NOVEMBER, AND THOSE ARE COVERED. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FOR THE LATER MODEL 1995 4 RUNNERS INDICATE THE DEFECT WAS NOT CORRECTED.*JB",
