I WAS TOLD THAT THE AIR BAG SENSOR HAD DAMAGED DUE TO A SPILL ON THE CONSOLE BOX AREA WHERE THE SENSOR IS LOCATED.  I THEN LOOKED INTO THIS FURTHER BY GOING ON LINE TO NHTSA AND WAS INFORMED OF A RECALL ON MY 1994 GEO PRISM VIN#1Y1SK5364RZ0763 FOR THE SAME SENSOR.   IT ALSO LISTED HOW THE DAMAGED WOULD BE CAUSED WORD BY WORD TO WHAT I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER WAS THE PROBLEM WITH MY CAR.   THE RECALL LISTED CAMPAIGN #96V107000; I THEN CONTACTED CHEVROLET IN ORDER TO GET MORE INFORMATION.  I WAS TOLD BY A REPRESENTATIVE, THAT MY CAR VIN# DID NOT COME UNDER THE RECALL CAMPAIGN.  I FIND IT VERY ODD THAT THIS WOULD BE THE CASE.   SINCE WHAT DEALER DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM WITH MY CAR SENSOR TO MATCHING WORD TO WORD WITH THE SUMMARY LISTED IN NHTSA RECALL NOTICE SUMMARY.   I HAVE 3 SMALL CHILDREN AND WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR ASSISTANCE IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS SITUATION.    SINCERELY,    NORA",
