I TOOK OUT A LOAN AGAINST MY 401K TO PURCHASE THE INTREPID BECAUSE MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE WAS GETTING A LOT OF MILES ON IT AND I NEEDED A RELIABLE VEHICLE TO GET ME TO WORK. WELL NOW THE ENGINE APPEARS TO BE LOCKED UP AND I DON'T EVEN HAVE THE MONEY TO GET IT CHECKED OUT AT THE DEALER. NOW I AM BACK TO MY OLD RELIABLE 1992 PONTIAC GRAND AM WITH OVER 205,000 MILES ON IT. THIS DODGE MOTOR SHOULD OF LASTED TO AT LEAST 150,000 MILES. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED. I THOUGHT THEY HAD IMPROVED THERE PRODUCTS SINCE THE 80'S. BOY WAS I WRONG.*AK",
