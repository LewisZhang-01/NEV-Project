THEY DID SERVICE TO CLEAN DUST. EVEN AFTER THAT, THE SOUND DID NOT GO. THEY MENTIONED THIS IS NORMAL FOR ALL SEINNA'S. THEY SAID THE SOUND COMING WHEN METAL PADS HITS METAL RINGS, DRUM. I BELIEVE THE SOUND IS DUE TO DESIGN FAULT OR FAULT MATERIALS. I BOUGHT A BRAND NEW VEHICLE AND ONLY 20000 MILES ON IT. THEY REFUSED TO REPLACE ANY PARTS. THEY SAID THERE IS NO PROBLEM AND EVERY THING NORMAL. I AM DISAPPOINTED IN BUYING A BRAND NEW SEINNA XLE (HIGHER MODEL) AND PAID AROUND $30000. PLEASE HELP ME RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. I CALLED TOYATA CUSTOMER SERVICE. NO HELP FROM THEM. THEY HAVE 100 REASONS TO COVER UP ANY COMPLAINT.     *JB",
