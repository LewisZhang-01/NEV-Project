ONCE THE BRAKES 'GRAB' STOPPING IS NOT A PROBLEM; I'VE LEARNED TO BRAKE EARLY. THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE REDUCED IF YOU TRY TO FREQUENTLY TOUCH THE BRAKES, I'M ASSUMING THIS CLEARS WATER BUILD-UP FROM THE ROTORS/PADS. IS THIS A PROBLEM WITH THE OPEN DESIGN OF THE ALLOY WHEELS OR IS THE DISC/ROTOR GUARD THAT SITS BEHIND THE WHEEL BECOMING FILLED WITH WATER? FYI, I HAVE A 2000 PASSAT 4MOTION GLX WAGON.",
