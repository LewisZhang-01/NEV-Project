IT HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES LAST WINTER AND AGAIN DURING THIS LAST COLD SPELL IN JANUARY. WE WERE LUCKY TO BE ABLE TO GET THE CAR OFF THE ROAD AND STOPPED. DOWNSHIFTING AND HEAVY BRAKING ALMOST DIDN'T GET IT STOPPED. THE CAR WENT TO THE SHOP AGAIN FOR A BANDAID FIX BUT I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT SOMETIMES THIS PARTICULAR CAR JUST DOES THAT. I WAS CHARGED $130.00 FOR THEM TO CLEAN THE THROTTLE BODY AND TOLD THAT I SHOULD REMOVE THE AIR FILTER AND CLEAN THE HOUSING MYSELF OCCASIONALLY. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. *JB",
