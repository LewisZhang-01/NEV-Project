        "summary": "I HAD JUST FILLED THE GAS TANK AND WHEN I MADE A TURN THE ENGINE DIED WHILE I WAS TURNING. I PUT THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL AND ATTEMPTED TO START THE CAR A FEW TIMES AND IT FINALLY STARTED. WHEN THE ENGINE FAILED THE POWER STEERING WAS DISABLED AND IT MADE ME ALMOST HIT ANOTHER CAR WHO HAD TO ADJUST HIS ROUTE SO I WOULD NOT HAVE A COLLISION WITH HIM. THERE IS A STRONG ODOR OF GAS AS WELL. I HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM BEFORE AFTER FILLING THE GAS TANK WITH THE MOTOR DYING AT A STOP LIGHT. THE CHECK OIL LIGHT COMES ON BUT NOT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT. THE MOTOR ONLY FAILS WHEN I FILL THE GAS TANK MORE THAN 3/4 FULL.    I HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE CAR CUTTING OFF AFTER FILLING THE TANK COMPLETELY FOR SEVERAL YEARS. TO AVOID THIS DANGEROUS SCENARIO I HAVE HAD TO ESTIMATE THE GAS REMAINING TO ADJUST FILLING TO ABOUT 3/4 OF A TANK. I UNDERSTAND AFTER READING DODGE BLOGS THAT THERE IS A VERY EXPENSIVE FIX FOR THIS BY REPLACING THE GAS TANK. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE IN A POSITION TO ONLY FILL MY TANK 3/4 FULL TO AVOID A POSSIBLE ACCIDENT. THIS IS CLEARLY A DEFECT THAT THE MANUFACTURE IS AWARE OF AFTER READING THE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS.   *TR",
