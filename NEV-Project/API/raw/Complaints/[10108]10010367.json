AFTER A WHILE, SOMETIME IN MARCH OF 2003 THE PROBLEM REAPPEARED AND COOLANT IS LEAKING INTO OIL AGAIN.  IT ALSO SEEMED THAT SOMEBODY REPLACED THE OIL COOLER EVEN BEFORE I BOUGHT THE CAR.  I HAD TO PAY A FORTUNE TO REPAIR IT THE FIRST TIME AND NOW IT'S IN THE SHOP AGAIN AND I WILL SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN THIS TIME.  I AM TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH CADILLAC, I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CADILLAC OR POSSIBLY EVEN GM AFTER ALL THE PROBLEMS I HAD WITH THIS CAR. THIS WAS MY FIRST DISAPPOINTMENT WITH AMERICAN NAME CAR.*JB",
