WHEN DECELERATING AFTER DRIVING FOR A LITTLE WHILE, AND SPEED REACHED 10 MPH (WHILE DECELERATING) THE CAR VIBRATES VIOLENTLY, THEN SHUTS OFF. WHEN I RESTART THE ENGINE IT RUNS NOISILY WHILE STILL IN PARK, THEN SHUTS OFF AGAIN WHEN PUT IN GEAR.  I HAVE TO WAIT A MINUTE OR TWO BEFORE I START THE CAR AND PUT IT IN GEAR AND IT RUNS, UNTIL I DECELERATE AGAIN AND THE CYCLE STARTS OVER.    I HAVE HAD MY HEAD GASKET REPAIRED/REPLACE BY JAY PONTIAC IN COLUMBUS GEORGIA AT MY EXPENSE BECAUSE I RECEIVE THE RECALL NOTICE ON THE HEAD GASKET LEAK SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE RECALL CAMPAIGN WAS OVER. I HAVE HAD MY ALTERNATOR REPAIRED/REPLACED, TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS, ETC.  THE DEALER NEVER SEES ANY PROBLEMS WHEN HE DIAGNOSES MY CAR ON HIS COMPUTER & EVERYTIME HE SUGGESTS WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND I GO BROKE PAYING TO GET IT FIXED, THE PROBLEM REMAINS.  I AM VERY FED UP WITH PONTIAC & GM & THEIR DEALERS/SERVICE PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO KNOW NOTHING OF THEIR PRODUCTS' FAILURE.  I NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WITH MY CAR SO I CAN GET IT FIXED.  I AM ALSO SEEKING TO PURCHASE A NEW VEHICLE AND FROM THE HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE I'VE BEEN HAVING WITH PONTIAC & GM I AM STAYING AWAY FROM THEIR PRODUCTS AND ADVISING EVERYONE I KNOW TO STAY AWAY FROM THEM.  I AM AT THE POINT WHERE THE ONLY AUTOMOBILE PRODUCT I AM INTERESTED IN IS FOREIGN MADE.  I UNDERSTAND YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND A PRODUCT HAVING PROBLEMS EVEN THE MANUFACTURER CAN'T FIGURE OUT.    *JB",
