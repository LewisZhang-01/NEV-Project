THE DRIVER INDICATED THE SMOKE BEGAN COMING FROM THE SEAM WHERE THE COWL AND HOOD MEET, OFFSET RIGHT OF THE CENTER OF THE TRUCK. THE DRIVER SAID THE SMOKE QUICKLY TURNED TO FIRE WHICH HE WAS UNABLE TO CONTROL AND MINUTES LATER AUTHORITIES ARRIVED TO EXTINGUISH THE FLAMES. MY COMPANY WAS ASKED TO PERFORM AN INSPECTION OF THE TRUCK FOLLOWING THE FIRE AND FOUND EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT THE FIRE ORIGINATED FROM THE COWL OPENING FOR THE HVAC SYSTEM. THE VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY BEING HELD IN SECURE STORAGE AND WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST AN INSPECTION TO SEE IF THE EVENT MAY BE RELATED TO AN ON-GOING INVESTIGATION BY YOUR OFFICE INTO SIMILAR CLAIMS REGARDING THIS MODEL TRUCK.   *TR",
