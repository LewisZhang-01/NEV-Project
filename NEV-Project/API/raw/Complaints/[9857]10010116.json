I WAS TOLD MY FIRST TIME OF CONTACTING THE MANUFACTURER (BEFORE I MADE A CLAIM) THAT THE SENSORS WERE IN THE FRONT OF THE CAR AND THE AIR BAGS SHOULD NOT HAVE DEPLOYED. AFTER I FILED A CLAIM ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY LOST ALL TIES WITH ME EVER TALKING WITH THAT SPECIALIST BUT ALL MY OTHER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE MANUFACTURER WERE RECORDED. AFTER ARGUING WITH THEM FOR MONTHS I DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND FILE A CLAIM THROUGH MY INSURANCE COMPANY. DOING THAT I HAD TO WAIT 3 WEEKS BEFORE MY AIR BAGS WOULD COME IN BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY. A GENTLEMAN AT MY OFFICE HIS SON ALSO WAS DRIVING DOWN THE RODE WENT OVER A STEEL PLATE AND THE SAME AIR BAGS WENT OFF. THEY AGAIN TOLD HIM 3-4 WEEKS FOR THE AIR BAG. THE AIR BAGS WENT OFF DUE TO A SCRATCH UNDER THE DOOR.*JB",
