THE CONTACT TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER, BUT NO FAILURES WERE FOUND.  IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEAVING THE DEALER, THE CONTACT NOTICED THAT THE FRONT WHEELS WERE UNSTABLE.  HE RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER A WEEK LATER AND A DIAGNOSTIC TEST INDICATED THAT THERE WAS AN ALIGNMENT FAILURE.  THE MECHANIC STATED THAT THE FAILURE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPAIRED ON THE VEHICLE.  IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEAVING THE DEALER THE SECOND TIME, HE NOTICED THAT THE VEHICLE WOULD STOP ABRUPTLY WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS DEPRESSED.  THIS WAS A PERSISTENT FAILURE.  HE CURRENTLY MUST AVOID CRASHING INTO OTHER VEHICLES AS A RESULT OF THE BRAKE FAILURE.  HE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER AGAIN AND THEY ADVISED THE CONTACT TO GO TO THE ORIGINAL DEALER TO RECEIVE ANY REPAIRS.  THE CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 12,000 AND FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 8,000.
