VIBRATES OFTEN AT LOW SPEEDS (30 MPH), AS THOUGH IT'S IN TOO HIGH OF A GEAR FOR THE TERRAIN.  CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON INTERMITTENTLY, USUALLY FOR SEVERAL DAYS THEN GOES OFF FOR A FEW DAYS BEFORE COMING BACK ON AGAIN.  I'VE GOTTEN TWO ESTIMATES FOR THE REPAIR, BOTH IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF $2,500 FOR A REBUILD OF MY TRANSMISSION OR INSTALLATION OF A RE-MANUFACTURED TRANSMISSION.  RECENTLY HAD TO HAVE COOLANT SENSOR AND FUEL PRESSURE REGULATOR REPLACED AS A RESULT OF REGULARLY OCCURRING CHECK ENGINE LIGHT.   *NLM",
