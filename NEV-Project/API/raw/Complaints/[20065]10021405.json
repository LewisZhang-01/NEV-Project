I DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY AND THEN BROUGHT IT TO A DEALER THE NEXT MORNING. THEY STATED THERE WAS A FAILURE IN THE SHIFT INTERLOCK SOLENOIV AND THE INGNITION LOCK CYLINDER ALSO NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. MY CAR HAS 33,000 MILES AND HAS MAINTANANCE REGULARLY(OIL CHANGE,ETC...). THE DEALER WANTS TO CHARGE $520 TO FIX A FAILED PART. THEY ALSO STATED IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN. ANY INFORMATION ON THIS WOULD BE WONDERFUL. THANK YOU.*AK",
