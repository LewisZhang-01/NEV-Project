THE DEALSHIP PERFORMED THE MAJORITY OF THE  OIL CHANGES FOR WHICH THERE WERE RECORDS (THE LAST WAS JUST 2000 MI PRIOR TO FAILURE) THERE WERE A FEW THAT WERE PERFORMED BY ME FOR WHICH I COULDN'T PRODUCE THE RECEIPTS OF THE OIL AND FILTER PURCHASE.  HENCE, NO SATISFACTION WAS PROVIDED BY EITHER THE DEALERSHIP OR CHRYSLER.  AFTER RESEARCHING THE INCIDENT FURTHER, I HAVE FOUND THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST A COUPLE HUNDRED OTHERS WITH SIMILAR STORIES.  OBVIOUSLY THESE ENGINES RUN EXCESSIVELY HOT UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, THUS PRODUCING SLUDGE THAT BUILDS UP OVER TIME (COLLECTING IN THE OIL PAN AND OBSTRUCTING THE PICKUP FILTER IN MY CASE) THAT IS NOT REMOVED BY ROUTINE OIL CHANGES.  THIS SMACKS OF DESIGN FLAWS TO ME.",
