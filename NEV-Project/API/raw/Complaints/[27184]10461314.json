I NOTICE 2 WEEKS BEFORE WHEN I WANTED ACCELERATE IT WOULDN'T GO ANY FASTER THEN 30MPH AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS IT WOULD SPEED. MY CONCERN IS THAT THERE WAS NOT ANY INDICATION THAT ANYTHING WAS WRONG UNTIL THE LAST INCIDENT WHERE IT JUST STOPPED. I HAD A FEW PEOPLE CHECKED AND THEY BELIEVE IT IS THE TRANSMISSION. I WENT ONLINE TO CHECK AND SEE IF ANYONE ELSE HAD EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEMS AND IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A RECALL YET. MERCEDES BENZ SUPPOSE TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR IT'S MANUFACTURED MISTAKES.  *TR",
