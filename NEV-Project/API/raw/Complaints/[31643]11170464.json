THE CAR ALSO STARTED MAKING KNOCKING SOUNDS WHEN TURNING THE WHEEL IN BOTH DIRECTIONS WHILE AT STOP OR MOVING SLOWLY. WE ARE CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR AN INSPECTION AT THE DEALERSHIP. THE SECOND MAJOR ISSUE IS THE TIRE PRESSURE MONITOR. THE TIRE PRESSURE THAT IT DISPLAYS DOES NOT MATCH THE ACTUAL ONE MEASURED WITH SEVERAL EXTERNAL INSTRUMENTS (CONSTANTLY 2 PSI LOWER ON ALL FOUR WHEELS). ADDITIONALLY, THE MONITOR SOMETIMES SWITCHES THE FRONT TIRE PRESSURE WITH THE REAR ONES, I.E. THE MONITOR DISPLAYS THE FRONT TIRE PRESSURE AS IF IT IS THE REAR TIRE PRESSURE. VERY CONFUSING!",
