THIS HAS HAPPENED REPEATEDLY STARTING WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS OF BUYING THE CAR.  THIS IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING WHEN DRIVING ON AN EXPRESSWAY RAMP. THUS I HAVE BEEN AVOIDING DRIVING ON THE EXPRESSWAY. ALSO, THE BRAKES WORK ABNORMALLY. THERE WAS EXCESSIVE VIBRATION, JERKINESS, AND BRAKE SENSITIVITY.   I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER WITHIN 5 DAYS OF PURCHASE AND SUBSEQUENTLY RETURNED IT 4 MORE TIMES. THEY ONLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE ROTORS WERE WARPED AND RESURFACED THEM. OTHERWISE, THEY DENY THERE IS ANY OTHER PROBLEM. THEY BLAMED THE ACCELERATION PROBLEM ON THE A/C BEING TURNED ON. HOWEVER, THE PROBLEM PERSISTS REGARDLESS TO WHETHER THE ACCESSORIES ARE TURNED ON OR OFF OR HOW HIGH THEY ARE TURNED ON.   *NLM",
