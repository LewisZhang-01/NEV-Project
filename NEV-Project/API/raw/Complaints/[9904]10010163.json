MY DAUGHTER'S SIENNA, VIN [XXX], WHICH IS A YEAR YOUNGER HAS THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM, SO DOES ONE OF HER FRIEND'S SIENNA. I DON'T HAVE THAT VEHICLE'S VIN BUT I COULD GET IT. TOYOTA CLAIMS : NO SAFETY ISSUE, DEFECTS ARE COINCIDENTAL. RIGHT!!! THEIR INVESTIGATORS SHOULD TAKE PROBABILITY 101 AT THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE. TO TOP IT ALL, THE REPAIR COSTS $750. WHAT AN INSULT!   BEFORE I FORGET; MY SIENNA HAD TWO WHEEL MOUNTING STUDS SHEAR OFF. I TORQUE THE NUTS MYSELF WITH A TORQUE WRENCH SET AT 85 LB/FT. I SUPPOSE THIS IS NOT A SAFETY DEFECT EITHER SINCE THERE ARE FIVE STUDS HOLDING THE WHEEL.  SINCE THE IMPORTER IS NOT CONCERNED, PERHAPS THEY WILL BE WHEN YOU ADD THIS INFORMATION TO YOUR DATABASE.   *NLM    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
