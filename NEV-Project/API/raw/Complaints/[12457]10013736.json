I HAVE HAD MECHANICS DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM AND THEY SAY TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION. I CALLED BMW THEY WILL NOT COVER THIS DESIGN PROBLEM TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION. THEIR WAS A SERVICE BULLETINS ISSUED IN 1999 AFTER THE WARRANTY HAD RUN OUT.(PERFECT TIMING). I THINK THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL CONSIDERING THE DANGER OF THIS ON THE OPEN ROAD.   *NLM",
