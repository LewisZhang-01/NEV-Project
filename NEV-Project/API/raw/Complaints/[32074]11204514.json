        "summary": "WHILE ON A HIGHWAY RUNNING AT 75 MPH MY \"ESC OFF\" LIGHT CAME ON AS WELL AS MY \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT AT THE SAME TIME. AS SOON AS THESE LIGHTS TURN ON I CAN NO LONGER ACCELERATE AND MY VEHICLE SLOWLY COMES TO A STOP.     DURING THIS TIME, EVERYTHING ELSE INCLUDING BRAKES, SIGNAL LIGHTS, RADIO AND ALL OTHER FEATURES SEEM TO BE FUNCTIONAL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ACCELERATION PEDAL WHICH DOES NOTHING. WHEN THE VEHICLE COMES TO A STOP AND I PUT IT INTO PARK, THE ENGINE SEEMS  TO HICCUP A LITTLE BIT AS IT SITS UNTIL I TURN THE VEHICLE COMPLETELY OFF AND RESTART IT. AFTER DOING SO, THE VEHICLE ACTS COMPLETELY NORMAL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT BEING ON.     THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY. IT HAPPENS ON CITY STREETS AND HIGHWAYS AND IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A MECHANICAL ISSUE. THIS IS POTENTIALLY VERY DANGEROUS SO THAT IS WHY I AM FILING A FORMAL COMPLAINT. I HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHERS ON HERE THAT HAVE FILED THIS EXACT COMPLAINT AND THIS NEEDS TO BE RECALLED.",
