SOME TIMES THE ENGINE WILL STOP ONLY FOR A MOMENT (LESS THAN 1 SECOND)  THEN COME RIGHT BACK ON. WHEN IT QUITS FOR MORE THAN A SECOND, THE IGNITION SWITCH MUST BE TURNED OFF THEN THE CAR CAN BE RESTARTED. THIS HAS HAPPENED PROBABLY MORE THAN 100 TIMES OVER THE LAST 4 YEARS. I HAVE TAKEN THE AUTO TO A DEALER AND INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOP, SPENT SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS AND HAVE YET TO BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM. ITS VERY UNSETTLING TO BE TRAVELLING AT 65 MPH AND THE ENGINE STOPS!*AK",
