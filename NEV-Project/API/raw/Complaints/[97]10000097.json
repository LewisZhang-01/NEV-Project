        "summary": "FAULTY IGNITION COMPONENT PRIMARILY USED IN ALL MAKES AND MODELS OF VEHICLES MANUFACTURED BY FORD FROM 1986-2000+. CAN CAUSE FIRE, HAS BEEN LISTED AS A RECALL BUT ONLY FOR SPECIFIC VIN NUMBERS. SAME COMPONENT, SAME MANUFACTURER, SAME INSTALLATION, SAME PROBLEMS FOR ALL VEHICLES MAY, HAVE OR CAN ARISE IT IS NOT VEHICLE SPECIFIC BUT COMPONENT SPECIFIC. IF SAME COMPONENTS WERE USED ON ALL VEHICLES MANUFACTURED DURING THIS TIME, THEN ALL VEHICLES MANUFACTURED ARE AT RISK OF HAVING THE SAME MALFUNCTION. THE COMPONENT CAN NOT DETERMINE WHICH VEHICLE SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT HAVE FIRE OR SAFETY ISSUES.  IT DOESN'T TAKE A ROCKET SCIENTIST TO FIGURE THIS OUT. NOR SHOULD IT TAKE EVEN ONE TRAGEDY TO MAKE THIS A PRIORITY FOR REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT. I DON'T THINK ANYONE SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT OPERATING A VEHICLE THAT HAS THE POSIBILITY OF BECOMING A FIRE HAZARD. FAULTY COMPONENT NOT FAULTY VEHICLE. OH AND FAULTY MANUFACTURER AS THEY CAN'T SEE THE OBVIOUS BUT CAN ONLY SEE THE TYPES OF VEHICLES REPORTED TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM AS THE ONLY ONES TO RECALL. YES THAT IS HOW THEY DETERMINE THE VEHICLES TO RECALL, THE ONES THAT WERE REPORTED. OH AND LETS NOT LEAVE OUT SHALL WE THE ONES THAT WEREN'T REPORTED BECAUSE NO ONE WAS THE WISER OR NOT WELL VERSED IN THE REPORTING/OR FILING OF COMPLAINTS A NUMBER IM SURE WE ALL KNOW WOULD BE ASTRONOMICAL. FORD F250'S MANUFACTURED DURING THIS TIME ALL HAD SAME ELECTRICAL SYSTEM COMPONENT INSTALLED AND SAME MANUFACTURER. OTHER VEHICLES BY FORD USED THIS SAME COMPONENT, LOTS OF DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE REGARDING THIS ITEM AND THE DEVESTATION AND TRAGEDY CAUSED BY ITS MALFUNCTION. I REFUSE TO BE ONE OF THESE TRAGEDIES IN ORDER TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM CORRECTED. OTHER RECALLS FOUND FOR FORD F250'S MANUFACTURED IN 1989:   FUEL TANK ASSEMBLY ATTACHMENTS  FUEL TANK AUXILLARY  POWER TRAIN: TRANSMISSION:AUTOMATIC:INDICATOR:LEVER:GEAR  FUEL TANK: AUXILLARY SELECTOR AND SWITCH  BRAKES: HYDRAULIC: SHOE AND DRUM SYSTEM: LININGS",
