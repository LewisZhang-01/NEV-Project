I PULLED OVER, GOT OUT AND TRIED TO FIX THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS AND THEY WOULD COME ON AND STOP AGAIN.  IT DID THIS 4-5 TIMES AND THEN THEY WOULDN'T COME ON AT ALL.  I HAD TO DRIVE ALL THE WAY HOME, ANOTHER 45 MINUTES, IN THE POURING RAIN ON THE INTERSTATE WITH NO WINDSHIELD WIPERS.  I HAVE A LETTER HERE FROM THE CHEVROLET MOTORS DIVISION CENTRAL OFFICE SAYING THAT CERTAIN VEHICLES MAY HAVE A WINDSHIELD WIPER MOTOR THAT FAILS DUE TO CRACKED SOLDER JOINTS ON THE CONTROLLER CIRCUIT BOARD.  THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT IS WRONG WITH MY TRUCK BUT MY TRUCK IS NOT LISTED ON THIS LETTER.  I CALLED MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.  THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND OBVIOUSLY ITS A PROBLEM THAT IS OCCURRING IN A LOT OF GM/CHEVROLET VEHICLES.  WHY ISN'T MY TRUCK LISTED ON THIS LETTER?  THIS COULD HAVE BEEN RESULTED IN A TRAGEDY YESTERDAY AND SINCE I KNOW THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING PROBLEM, I BELIEVE MY TRUCK AND PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED ALSO.    *NLM",
