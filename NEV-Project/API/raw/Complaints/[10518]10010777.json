IT WOULD NO LONGER RESPOND TO ANY GEAR CHANGE AND IN FACT, IT SOUNDED AND SMELLED TERRIBLE!  I WAS COMPLETELY STRANDED FOR SEVERAL HOURS ON A DARK WINDY ROAD UNTIL I COULD OBTAIN HELP.  UPON INVESTIGATION ON THE INTERNET I SAW THAT THIS IS UNFORTUNATELY A COMMONLY KNOWN PROBLEM FOR DODGE OWNERS.  I HAVE NEVER TOWED ANYTHING WITH MY CAR AND  HAD ALL ROUTINE MAINTENANCE COMPLETED.  THE TRANSMISSION REPAIR SHOP SAID THEY SEE THIS ALL THE TIME WITH CHRYSLER PRODUCTS.  DANGEROUS!!  *JB",
