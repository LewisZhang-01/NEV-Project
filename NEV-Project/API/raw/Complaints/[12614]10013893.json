I AM THINKING OF HAVING A REG. SHOP CHECK THE OIL LEVEL AS WELL AS THE DEALER, BECAUSE WHAT I AM READING IS NOT WHAT THE SERVICE DEPT IS WRITING ON THEIR REPORT. ONE OF THE SEVICE TECHS TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BUT CHEVY ISN'T GOING TO ADMIT THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE OF POSSIBLE LEGAL ACTION. HOW LONG DO I HAVE TO CONTINUE THIS TESTING BEFORE SOMETHING IS DECIDED?",
