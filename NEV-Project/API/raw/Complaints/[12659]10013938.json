VEHICLE HAD 23020 MILES AND IS A GLS WITH ALL WHEEL DRIVE, DATE OF MANUFACTURE WAS 13 JAN 01.  NO INJURIES, NO PROPERTY DAMAGE.  DEALER REPLACED CRUISE CONTROL CABLE AND STATED THAT THE CAUSE WAS THAT THE CABLE WAS MISROUTED.  ACCORDING TO DEALER THE CABLE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ROUTED THROUGH A METAL CLIP AT RIGHT REAR OF SURGE TANK/INTAKE MANIFOLD.  THIS CLIP IS ADJACENT TO THE CLIP USED TO SECURE THE GAS PEDAL CABLE.  THE REPLACEMENT CABLE APPEARS TO BE SHORTER THAN THE ORIGINAL CABLE AS IT IS NOT LONG ENOUGH TO BE PLACED IN THE METAL CLIP.  THE REPLACEMENT CABLE USED WAS PART #96430-26110 AND HAS A YELLOW LABEL WITH \"TO2\" ON IT.",
