THE PART BROKE, HUNG DOWN IN MY LINE OF DRIVING VISION AND WOULD NOT LOCK BACK IN PLACE.  BOTH HAVE NOW BROKEN AND I HAD TO REMOVE THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE SAFELY.  I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND USED PARTS FOR JUST UNDER 100 DOLLARS OR I WOULD HAVE TO PAY 130-150 FOR NEW VISORS.  I KNOW THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH MANY 2007 TOYOTA CAMRY OWNERS.  IT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT  A SERIOUS FLAW IN THE DESIGN OF THESE VISORS.  *TR",
