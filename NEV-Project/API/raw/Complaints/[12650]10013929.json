I TOOK MY VEHICLE IN TO HAVE THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP LOOK IT OVER, AS WELL AS CHECK TO SEE IF ANY OF THE RECALLS ON THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN TAKEN CARE OF, AS IT WAS A PROGRAM CAR.  I WAS ASSURED THAT NONE OF THE NUMEROUS RECALLS ON THE 2002 BUICK CENTURY APPLIED TO MY CARE.  I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT MY BEING SHOCKED WHEN I EXIT THE VEHICLE AFTER DRIVING IT.  THIS CONCERNS ME A GREAT DEAL, AS I HAVE READ ABOUT PEOPLE FUELING THEIR VEHICLES WHO CAUSE CUMBUSTION WHEN THE STATIC ELECTRICITY IS DISCHARGED.",
