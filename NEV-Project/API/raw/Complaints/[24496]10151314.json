IT IS ALWAYS A HASSLE GETTING THE KEY TO TURN. MY WIFE WAS TRYING TO LEAVE WORK ONE DAY AND THE KEY WOULDN'T TURN. I WENT TO HELP AND THE KEY NEVER DID TURN. I NOW HAVE TO REPLACE THE TUMBLERS INSIDE THE IGNITION. IT SEEMS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM AND EVEN AFTER REPLACING THE IGNITION ONCE IT ONLY LAST A YEAR UNTIL THEY HAVE TO REPLACE IT AGAIN. IT COSTS ABOUT $300 TO REPLACE. WE ENDED UP HAVING TO TOW HER CAR TO MY HOUSE WHERE I THEN HAD TO SPEND THE MONEY TO FIX IT. I DON'T THINK I SHOULD HAVE TO DO THIS IF EVERYONE IS HAVING THIS SAME PROBLEM. *JB",
