WHEN THE TRUCK IS JACKED UP OFF THE GROUND AND PUT IN GEAR THE REAR BRAKES WILL FAIL TO HOLD THE WHEELS STOPPED ONCE THE ENGINE REACHES APPROXIMATELY 1000 RPM. THEY SHOULD HOLD THE WHEELS UP TO 2600 RPM. THIS CAUSES UNSAFE BRAKING, EXCESS WEAR AND WARPING OF THE FRONT ROTORS. I AM AWARE OF OTHER R/T OWNERS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM AND AT LEAST ONE HAS HAD THEIR TRUCK BOUGHT BACK BY DODGE RATHER THAN DEAL WITH FIXING THE PROBLEM. MY LOCAL DEALER REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING.",
