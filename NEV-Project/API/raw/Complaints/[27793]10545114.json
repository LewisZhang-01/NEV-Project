I SAW ABOUT A MONTH AGO ON MY LOCAL NEWS OF CONSUMERS WHO ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES (THROTTLE BODY,CAR LOSES POWER WITHOUT NOTICE,ETC.) I EMAILED FORD TO ASK ABOUT REPAIR OR EVEN GOING HALF ON THE REPAIR FOR MY VEHICLE AS MY HOUSEHOLD IS UNABLE TO AFFORD IT DUE TO LOSS OF INCOME/JOB. I WAS TOLD THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO OR WILL OFFER HOWEVER, \"CERTAIN\" PEOPLE ARE GETTING THEIR REPAIRS TAKEN CARE OF. FOR IT TO MAKE THE NEWS THIS ISSUE IS A BIG DEAL. I BROUGHT IT TO FORDS ATTENTION TO LET THEM KNOW THAT ITS SIMPLY NOT THE NEWER MODEL CARS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING THIS MINE, AS WELL AS A FRIENDS FORD (2008) HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.   *JS",
