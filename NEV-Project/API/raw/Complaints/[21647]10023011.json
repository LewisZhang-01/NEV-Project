TOOK VEHICLE TO A VW DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT I NEEDED TO HAVE BOTH UPPER CONTROL ARMS REPLACED ON THE LEFT FRONT OF MY PASSAT.  I CALLED VWOA AND THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO HELP PAY FOR IT B/C IT IS CONSIDERED A WEAR ITEM.  A 99 PASSAT W/ LESS THAN 50K MILES!  AND THEY CONSIDER THAT WEAR?!?  FROM WHAT I HAVE RESEARCHED, I AM FAR FROM THE ONLY PERSON THAT THIS IS HAPPENING TO.  NOW I HAVE TO DISH OUT $500 EASY TO GET IT FIXED.  BUY ANOTHER VW?  NOT ON YOUR LIFE.  VW HAS BEEN HEARING THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SITUATION FOR YEARS NOW AND STILL WILL NOT HELP.  I WOULD HATE TO SEE SOMETHING TRAGIC TO SOMEONE JUST FOR THEM TO FESS UP.   *NLM",
