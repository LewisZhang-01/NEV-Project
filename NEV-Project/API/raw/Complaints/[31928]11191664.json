        "summary": "3-2-19 I BROUGHT CAR TO BMW IN FT PERCE, FL FOR 4 RECALLS WHICH THEY DID. THERE WAS A PASSENGER AIR BAG LIGHT ON AFTERWARDS WHICH THEY SAID THEY WOULD NOT FIX UNDER RECALL. I HAD A LICENSED ASC MECHANIC SCAN THE CAR AND IT CAME UP OC3 SEAT MAT FAULT.  I LOOKED UP THIS AND THERE WAS A CAMPAIGN APRIL 2009 WHICH SPECIFICALLY STATES ON THE 1ST PAGE UNDER SITUATION THAT AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT ISSUE IS EXTENDED 10 YEARS WITHOUT MILEAGE LIMIT.  I CALLED BMW HEADQUARTERS 3-25-19 AND FILED A REPORT, THEY TOLD ME MY VIN# WASN'T RECALLED BUT I SAID IT IS FOR THE PASSENGER SEAT MAT THAT WAS RECALLED APRIL 2009 AND THIS SHOULD BE COVERED IF IT IS THE SAME PROBLEM. THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD ESCALATE IT. TODAY, 3-26-19, I RECEIVED A CALL FROM ANOTHER BMW REP AND THEY SAID THEY WERE WORKING ON IT BUT THEY WOULD PROBABLY NOT COVER IT DUE TO THE AGE OF THE CAR AND MILEAGE. I TOLD THEM, \"NO,, YOUR APRIL 2009 RECALL SAYS IT WAS EXTENDED 10 YEARS WITHOUT MILEAGE LIMIT, SO IT SHOULD BE COVERED\". THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND IF OTHER SAME MAKE,MODEL, YEAR WERE RECALLED FOR THE SAME PROBLEM I AM HAVING THEN THEY NEED TO FIX MY CAR AT THEIR COST.  I NEED YOUR HELP IN GETTING THIS CAR RESOLVED AS I JUST RECENTLY BOUGHT IT.",
