I HAVE FOUND THAT FOREST RIVER HAS INSTALLED COKER BRAND PASSENGER TIRES 225R/15. THERE IS LESS THAN ONE INCH OF CLEARANCE BETWEEN THE TOP OF THE TIRES AND THE WHEEL WELL. THIS IS CAUSING RUBBING OF TIRES TO THE WHEEL WELLS. THE LEAF SPRINGS ARE NOT ADEQUATE FOR THE WEIGHT THE TRAILER. THESE SPRINGS ARE SHOWING SIGNS OF FLATTENING. ALSO THE TIRES WEIGHT RATING IS MUCH LESS THAN THE 3750# GVW. THANK YOU FOR LOOKING INTO THIS MATTER.     *TR",
