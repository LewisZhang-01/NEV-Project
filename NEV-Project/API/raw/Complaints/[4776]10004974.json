        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING UP AN INCLINE WHEN MY 2000 WINDSTAR VAN MADE A VERY LOUD NOISE AND SUDDENLY STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET. I TURNED THE VAN OFF FOR A MINUTE OR SO THEN RE-STARTED THE VEHICLE AND ATTEMPTED TO PROCEED FORWARD BUT THE VAN STARTED GOING IN REVERSE INSTEAD. I HAD TO HAVE THAT WINDSTAR WITH APPRXIMATELY 43,000 MILES TOWED HOME BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT GO FORWARD. I HAVE CONTACTED FORD MOTOR CO. CUSTOMER SERVICE TO NO AVAIL. ALL THEY COULD TELL ME WAS THAT THE VAN HAS MORE THAN 36,000 MILES SO THEY WE'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXPENSE OF REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION. THE VAN IS AT A FORD DEALER AT THIS VERY MOMENT. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE COST TO REPLCE THE TRANSMISSION WILL EXCEED $2000.00 . I NOW KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE FORD WINDSTAR 2000 TRANSMISSIONS PLEASE HAVE SOMETHING DONE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BEFORE SOME ONE DIES.",
