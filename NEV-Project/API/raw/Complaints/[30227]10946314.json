I REACHED DOWN AND THE SEAT WAS SO HOT THAT IT BURNT MY HAND FROM THE BRIEF CONTACT. I PULLED OVER TO FIND THAT THE HEATED SEAT ELEMENT HAD BURNT A HOLE IN THE LEATHER SEAT AS WELL AS BURNT A HOLE IN MY WOOL COAT. IRONICALLY, THIS OCCURRED IN MY LAST BMW AS WELL, A 2004 3-SERIES, JUST TO A LESSER EXTENT. I DID NOT RECEIVE BURNS FROM THAT INCIDENT, IT JUST MELTED THE LEFT SIDE OF MY SEAT.  *TR",
