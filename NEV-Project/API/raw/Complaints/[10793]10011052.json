WHEN I APPLY THE BRAKES I GET A PRETTY BAD VIBRATION IN THE PEDAL AND THE VEHICLE DOES NOT STOP VERY WELL.   I SPOKE WITH CHRYSLER AND THEY INFORMED ME THE ROTORS AND BRAKES WERE CONSIDERED WEAR PARTS AND WERE NOT COVERED BY THE WARRANTY.  I HAVE DONE SOME INVESTIGATING AND FOUND THIS APPEARS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM.  I WOULD LIKE TO FILE A COMPLAINT SO THAT MAYBE CHRYSLER WILL TRY TO RECTIFY THIS PROBLEM.  *JB",
