        "summary": "THE ENGINE OF THE BMW 2001 M3 HAD SERIOUS ENGINE FAILURES.  THE REQUEST FROM THE BMW DEALERSHIP ON EXPLAINATION WAS REJECTED, NOR WAS THERE ANY EXPLAINATION FROM THE CONSUMER RELATIONS OF BMW NA.  THE FAILURE WAS CONVERED UNDER WARRANTY BUT I WAS TOLD MY VEHICLE WAS THE ONLY ABNORMAL CAR IN THOUSANDS THAT WERE SOLD.  FROM MY RESEARCH THERE WERE MORE THAN 100 DOCUMENTED CASES OF THE NEW E46 M3 ENGINE HAVING PROBLEMS RANGING FROM CRANKSHAFT FAILURE TO FULL ENGINE DETONATION AND OIL SPILLAGE.  BMW SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO COMPENSATE OWNERS OF A $60K CAR IN THE DECREASE IN VALUE OF THE CAR AND ALSO HAVE EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR ONGOING PROBLEMS (THERE ARE COMPLAINTS THAT NEW \"REPLACED\" ENGINES ALSO EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEMS).  THERE IS A VERY HIGH CHANCE A DEADLY ACCIDENT COULD OCCUR IF I DID NOT NOTICE THE PROBLEM EARLY, RANGING FROM OIL SPILLS TO FIRE.  BMW IS NEGLECTING THE OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE BY NOT NOTIFYING THEM WHEN FIRST SIGNS OF PROBLEMS OCCUR.  IRONICALLY BMW DOES KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE REPLACED ALL THE PARTS IN THE NEW ENGINE WHILE KEEPING QUIET TO CURRENT CONSUMERS, ALSO MECHANICS HAVE BEEN TOLD TO REPLACE PARTS WHILE WORKING IN THE AREA OF THE ENGINE W/O TELLING CONSUMERS.  MECHANICS AT THE BMW DEALERSHIP HAS HAD MY VEHICLE FOR OVER A MONTH, WITH NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF PROGRESS.",
