I HAVE A 5 WEEK OLD DAUGHTER AND I HAD PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE IN FEBRUARY AFTER A CAR ACCIDENT THAT TOTALED MY MITSUBISHI GALANT. PART OF THE REASON I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE IS BECAUSE I WAS TOLD BY SEVERAL PEOPLE THAT IT WAS A VERY SAFE VEHICLE TO HAVE AND AT THIS POINT N TIME I DON'T FEEL IT IS SAFE FOR MY BABY. THE THOUGHT OF BEING INVOLVED IN ANOTHER ACCIDENT IS SCARY ENOUGH LET ALONE THE THOUGHT OF BEING IN ONE AND KNOWING THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE SAFETY BELT I RELY ON TO KEEP HER CAR SEAT IN PLACE COULD COME UNDONE UPON IMPACT. THE POINT OF TELLING YOU ALL THIS IS SO YOU MIGHT PASS IT ON TO CHRYSLER CORP AND STRONGLY URGE THEM TO RECALL THE SAFETY BELTS, REPLACING OUR EXISTING ONES WITH THE SAFEST ONES AVAILABLE. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND HOPE THAT ACTION WILL BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.    *NLM",
