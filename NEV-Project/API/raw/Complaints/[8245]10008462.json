IT WAS UNDRIVABLE.  DEALER INSTALLED POWER STEERING LINE AND POWER STEERING COOLER.  SINCE THEN, FLUID HAS LEAKED TWICE AGAIN.  DEALER HAS REPLACED ANOTHER HOSE, AND SPRING CLAMPS.  THEN HEARD \"WHIRRING' NOISE.  HAD TO RETURN TO DEALER A LAST TIME TO PURGE AIR OUT OF SYSTEM THAT WAS NOT DONE CORRECTLY DURING REPAIRS.  SO FAR, NO MORE LEAKS, BUT I AM NOT CERTAIN IT IS FIXED FOR GOOD.  CURRENTLY WE ARE IN ARBITRATION THROUGH THE NCDS BECAUSE OF THIS AND OTHER REPAIRS REPEATEDLY PERFORMED.*JB",
