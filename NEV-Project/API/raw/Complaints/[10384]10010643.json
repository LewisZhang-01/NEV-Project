THIS CAUSES THE COMPRESSOR TO TURN ON AND OFF, EVENTUALLY CAUSING PREMATURE COMPRESSOR FAILURE. MY BRAKES WERE SQUEAKING SO I WENT TO JUST BRAKES TO GET THEM CHANGED AND IT COST 636.00. I HAD TO HAVE A FOUR WHEEL FRICTION RELINE, DISC PADS RF AND LF, BRAKE SHOES RELINED RR AND LR, ROTORS WERE NEW (COULD NOT CUT) MACHINE RF LF, DRUM MACHINE RR LR, WHEEL CYLINDERS NEW RR LR, BLEED, FLUSH, FILL AND ADJUST BRAKE SYSTEM, ETC. I WENT TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAID \"BECAUSE I DID NOT BRING THE VEHICLE TO THEM, TO GET SERVICED THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO ABOUT IT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT LOOK AT THE MATERIAL.\" EVEN THOUGH I HAD THE MATERIAL FOR THEM TO LOOK AT. SO I GUESS I HAVE TO EAT THE $700.00 JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR DEFECTIVE MATERIAL.   *JB",
