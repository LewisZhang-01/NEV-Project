        "summary": "WHEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, MY JEEP INSTANTLY TURNED OFF WITH NO INDICATION THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG; NO INDICATION OF LIGHTS OR WARNING ISSUES PRESENTED JUST A LOSS OF COMPLETE POWER. BRAKES WERE HARD TO PUSH AND THE POWER STEERING WAS LOST AS WELL MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL WHILE THE CAR SLOWED DOWN FROM GOING 50 MPH. I WAS LUCKILY IN THE FAR RIGHT LANE WHEN IT HAPPENED MAKING IT EASIER TO PULL OFF TO SAFETY FOR MYSELF AND FOR EVERYONE ELSE BEHIND ME. ONCE STOPPED, I TURNED THE CAR BACK ON AND ALL IT DID WAS MAKE A SPUTTERING LIKE NOISE, BUT NEVER TURNED ON. I WAITED 5 MINUTES AND TRIED TO START IT AGAIN AND THE CAR TURNED ON THIS TIME, BUT ROUGHLY 30 SECONDS LATER IT JUST TURNED OFF AGAIN WITH NO WARNING. I FOUND A RECALL ON THE CRANKSHAFT SENSOR WHICH CAUSES THE ENGINE TO STALL, BUT WHEN ENTERING MY VIN IT SHOWS THAT THERE IS NO RECALL ON MY CAR'S VIN. THIS RECALL NEEDS TO BE OPENED UP FOR OTHER VIN'S. THE RECALL WITH CHRYSLER IS S89. THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE!",
