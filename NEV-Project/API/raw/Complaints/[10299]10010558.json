        "summary": "I AM HAVING MULTIPLE PROBLEMS WITH MY 6 MONTH OLD TRUCK. A STRANGE OIL LOSS THAT WAS LOOSING 1-2 QUARTS OF OIL A WEEK, NOW FIXED FOR THE MOMENT. THE CLUTCH DISENGAGES IF ANY PRESSURE IS APPLIED TO THE CLUTCH PEDAL AND WILL NOT ENGAGE UNTIL THE PEDAL IS FULLY RELEASED, DEALER CLAIMS ITS NORMAL. VARIOUS ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS WITH THIS HEAP, INCLUDING FAILING SENSORS, INTERIOR LIGHT COMING ON WHEN IT WANTS TO, AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON OCCASIONALLY. THIS TRUCK HAS STARTING PROBLEMS SOMETIMES, YOU HAVE TO CRANK THE ENGINE FOR A LONG TIME(UP TO 30 SECONDS SOMETIMES) BEFORE IT WILL START. HAD TO HAVE A TIRE REPLACED WITH 1066 MILES ON THE VEHICLE BECAUSE SOME OF THE TREAD WAS BEGINNING TO COME OFF, VEHICLE WAS REALIGNED AT THE SAME TIME TO CURE A PULL TO THE RIGHT WHICH DID NOTHING STILL PULLS TO THE RIGHT. I HAVE TRIED TO GET IN CONTACT OF FORD MOTOR COMPANY TO GET THIS VEHICLE REPLACED UNDER A LEMON LAW TO NO AVAIL. I GET TOLD A STORY AND PUT OFF, THE DEALERSHIP I BOUGHT THIS THING FROM DOES THE SAME THING TRIES TO FIX IT TO NO AVAIL AND PUTS ME OFF. I PAID 15 THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THIS TRUCK AND NOW MAY LOSE MY JOB BECAUSE IT IS NOT DEPENDABLE! SOMETHING MUST BE DONE THIS IS NOT HOW TO TREAT A REPEAT CUSTOMER, THIS BEING MY 4TH FORD PRODUCT AND MY LAST.   *NLM",
