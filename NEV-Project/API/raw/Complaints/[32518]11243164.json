ON MY WAY TO DETROIT MY TEMP GAUGE REACHES MAX, THUS ILLUMINATING A RED TEMP WARNING. I QUICKLY FOUND A PAY-TO-PARK LOT NEAR MY DESTINATION. WHILE ALLOWING TIME FOR THE ENGINE TO COOL DOWN,  I GOOGLED MY ENGINE LIGHT AND OVERHEATING ISSUE. RETURNING TO MY VEHICLE I WAS ABLE TO QUICKLY DIAGNOSE A WELL KNOWN ISSUE INVOLVING A WOBBLY COOLING FAN AND A BLOWN 50A FUSE. FORTUNATELY THE NIGHT COOLED AND I WAS ABLE TO RETURN HOME WITHOUT AC NOR THE AID OF AN OPERATING COOLING FAN. MY STORIES SIMILAR TO COUNTLESS OTHERS. I'VE SEEN ONE VIDEO CLAIMING A RECALL FIX POSTED LAST MONTH. IT APPEARS A SHIELD HAS BEEN ADDED...I BELIEVE THAT'LL DEFINITELY FIX THE POORLY ENGINEERED ISSUE INVOLVING THE PROXIMITY OF THE FAN TO THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD.",
