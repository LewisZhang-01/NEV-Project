        "summary": "COOLING SYSTEM LEAKAGE-THE BLACK PLASTIC COVER ON THE INTAKE MANIFOLD LEAKS COOLANT/WATER. IT LEAKS WHEN THE WEATHER IS COLD, IT DOES THIS WHEN EVER PARKED AND THE CAR IS ALLOWED TO SIT AND GET COLD. THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE IT IS LEAKING AROUND THE BASE OF THE PLASTIC COVER WHERE IT SEALS AGAINST THE ALUMINUM INTAKE MANIFOLD. IT HAS DONE THIS EVERY WINTER FOR THE PAST FOUR WINTERS. IT IS GETTING WORSE, AND FROM THE COMPLAINTS I HAVE READ IT IS COMMON TO THE 3.8 L ENGINE. IT DOES NOT LEAK AT ALL IN THE SUMMER OR FALL, ONLY IN THE WINTER BELOW 35 DEGREE'S. WHAT IS THE REAL PROBLEM AND IS THERE A SOLID FIX FOR THIS, OR ARE ALL REPAIRS JUST TEMPORARY UNTIL THE NEW GASKETS START LEAKING AGAIN? IS THERE ANY TYPE OF RECOURSE OR RECALL? THE COLDER IT GETS, THE BIGGER THE LEAK AND THE PUDDLE UNDER THE CAR. IT ALSO STINKS WHEN YOU DRIVE IT WHILE THE COOLANT COOKS ON THE MOTOR.  *JB",
