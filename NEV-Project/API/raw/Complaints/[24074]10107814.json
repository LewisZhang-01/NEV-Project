SO, I LEFT MY CAR AT THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THAT A REGIONAL MANAGER WOULD HAVE TO APPROVE MY REPAIR BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY WAS CAUSING MY PROBLEM.  I PICKED UP MY CAR 5 DAYS LATER WITH NO REPAIRS BEING MADE AND THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTING.  MY LAST CONVERSATION WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER, I WAS TOLD THAT THE REGIONAL MANAGER STILL HAS YET TO RESPOND TO MY PROBLEM.  SO NOW I AM STUCK WITH A MANUAL TRANSMISSION CAR THAT I CANNOT USE THE EMERGENCY BREAK FOR WHEN I NEED IT BECAUSE OF THE WINTER WEATHER.  *NM",
