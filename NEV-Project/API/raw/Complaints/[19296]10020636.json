        "summary": "I HAVE HAD TO REPAIR MY BRAKES DUE TO WARPED ROTORS 3 TIMES AND AM CURRENTLY IN NEED OF A 4TH BRAKE REPAIR DUE TO THE SAME PROBLEM. MY VEHICLE ONLY HAD 14,844 MILES WHEN IT WAS REPAIRED THE 1ST TIME. I INQUIRED AT THE TIME WHY I WOULD NEED A BRAKE REPAIR AT SUCH LOW MILEAGE. THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID, \"YOU HAVE A 4WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLE AND THEY WEAR OUT THE BRAKES EASILY, THE BRAKES ARE NOT MADE HEAVY ENOUGH FOR THE EXTRA WEIGHT WHEN STOPPING.\" I REPLIED THAT THIS SOUNDED LIKE AN ERROR IN THE DESIGN AND I WOULD EXPECT FOR THE DEALERSHIP TO PICK UP THE CHARGES. HE AGREED AND THE WARRANTY COVERED THE EXPENSE THE 1ST TIME, BUT WHEN THE 2ND AND 3RD TIME CAME AROUND THEY WOULD NOT PAY FOR THE REPAIRS. THE 2ND BRAKE JOB WAS NEEDED AT 30,219MILES.  I TRIED A DIFFERENT DEALERSHIP SERVICE SHOP FOR REPAIRS, BUT THE EXPENSE WAS OUT OF MY POCK THERE ALSO.  I HAD AN EXTENDED WARRANTY OF 50.000 MILES, BUT THEY WOULD NOT PAY.  THE 3RD BRAKE JOB WAS NEEDED AT 39,758 MILES FOR THE SAME REASON AND I PAID FOR THAT EXPENSE TOO. I AM NOW IN NEED OF A 4TH BRAKE REPAIR AT 65,403 MILES. FROM MY UNDERSTANDING I SHOULD ONLY NEED BRAKE SERVICE OF THIS KIND EVERY 30,000 MILES OR MORE. THE BRAKES PULSATE AND SHAKE WHEN I TRY TO STOP, CAUSING THE STEERING WHEEL TO WOBBLE VERY HARD. I AM CURRENTLY WAITING TO SAVE THE MONEY TO FIX THEM FOR THIS 4TH TIME, BUT AM VERY UPSET AT HAVING TO PAY FOR AND DRIVE WITH AN OBVIOUS DESIGN FLAW IN THE JEEP'S BRAKE SYSTEM.",
