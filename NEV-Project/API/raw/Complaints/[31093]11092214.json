        "summary": "I HAD FOR YOKOHAMA AVID ASCEND  BLU EARTH  TIRES INSTALLED AT MY LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP ON  5/21/2016.  COST WAS NEARLY $1000 INSTALLED!!  VEHICLE MILEAGE AT INSTALLATION WAS 171,500 MILES. THIS VEHICLE HAS BECOME A SECONDARY VEHICLE AND RARELY GETS USED.   THE VEHICLE CURRENTLY HAS 175,700 MILES (5/1/2018).  OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS, ALL FOUR TIRES HAVE HAD  INTERNAL BELT SEPARATION.  ALL FOUR TIRES HAD THE SAME MANUFACTURING DATE OF 85D4015  STAMPED ON THEM. I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE ALL FOUR TIRES DUE TO THIS VERY DANGEROUS AND POSSIBLY DEADLY CONDITION.  DISCOUNT TIRE CALLED YOKOHAMA TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION. YOKOHAMA DECLINED TO REPLACE TIRES FREE OF CHARGE EVEN THOUGH THESE TIRES WERE FAIRLY NEW WITH 80% TREAD REMAINING. THEY AGREED TO COVER 60% OF THE  COST TO REPLACE THE FOUR TIRES.  I PAID ROUGHLY $300 TO REPLACE THE FOUR TIRES. YOKOHAMA IS MANUFACTURING DEFECFTIVE TIRES AND GETTING AWAY WITH IT  BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE NOTHING TO ALTER THEIR  DEFECTIVE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ARE POSSIBLY KILLING PEOPLE IN THE PROCESS.",
