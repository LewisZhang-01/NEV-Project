TAKING IT TO DEALER ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, BUT IT NEVER HAPPENS FOR THEM AND IT NEVER THROWS A MALFUNCTION CODE. WORKS FINE DURING NORMAL OPERATION. ONE OTHER PROBLEM, WHEN THIS ISSUE ARISES IS THAT I CANNOT RESTART THE CAR WITHOUT GETTING OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND TAKING THE KEY FOB OUT OF RANGE FOR AT LEAST 30+ SECONDS. ONCE THE ELECTRONICS RESET, I CAN ONCE AGAIN START THE VEHICLE. AS YOU CAN VISUALIZE, THIS IS SOMETIMES A DANGEROUS SITUATION OUT ON A BUST ROAD OR STREET.",
