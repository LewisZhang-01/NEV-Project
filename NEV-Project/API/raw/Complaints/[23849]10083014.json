I SCHEDULED TO HAVE HONDA ACCESSORIES INSTALLED BY THE HONDA DEALERSHIP ON JULY 15TH-16TH, AND PICKED UP MY VEHICLE ON JULY 17TH.*AK    UPON PICKING UP THE VEHICLE (369 MILES ON ODOMETER) THE DRIVER'S SIDE SEATBELT WOULD NOT RETRACT.  THE SEATBELT WAS COMPLETELY PULLED OUT AND STILL WOULD NOT RETRACT.  IT TOOK THE DEALERSHIP SEVERAL HOURS, BUT THEY MANAGED TO REPLACE THE DRIVER'S SIDE SEATBELT WHICH HAD FAILED.      THE REPLACEMENT UNIT RETRACTS VERY SLOWLY AND HAS TO BE MANUALLY MANEUVERED INTO PLACE.  WILL NEED TO SCHEDULE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT AGAIN.    IN ADDITION TO THIS MAJOR SAFETY INCIDENT, THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE GAUGE HAS MALFUNCTIONED AND NO LONGER READS THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE.",
