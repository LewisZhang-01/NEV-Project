EACH OF THESE VEHICLES HAS EXPERIENCED THE FAILURE OF THE UNDER DASH ABS ELECTRONIC MODULES WHEN THE VEHICLES REACHED APPROXIMATELY 85,000 MILES OR SO.  WE CONTACTED GMC TO PLACE A COMPLIANT.  THE REPAIR CHARGES FOR THIS PROBLEM HAVE RANGED FROM $800 TO $1050 EACH. GMC  REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM OR TO REIMBURSE FOR ANY REPAIR COSTS FOR THEIR OBVIOUS DEFECTIVE PARTS. FAILURE OF THE ABS MODULE STILL ALLOWS FOR USE OF THE BRAKES BUT FAILURE OF THE ABS SYSTEM WHICH COULD RESULT IN ACCIDENTS. *JB",
