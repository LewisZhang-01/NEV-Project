ON ONE OCCASION THIS HAPPENED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD; FORTUNATELY IT WAS A QUIET STREET AND I WAS ABLE TO COAST TO THE SIDE OF THE STREET. IF THIS HAD HAPPENED ON A BUSY STREET IT COULD HAVE CAUSED INJURY OR DEATH.  SEVERAL MECHANICS DID DIFFERENT KINDS OF REPAIRS, BUT THE PROBLEM KEPT RECURRING.  WE ARE NOW GETTING THE THROTTLE BODY REPLACED AND HOPE THIS IS THE FINAL REPAIR THAT REMOVES THE PROBLEM.   NUMEROUS OTHER FORD FIVE HUNDRED OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS (PER INTERNET RESEARCH).  FORD NEEDS TO RECALL THE FIVE HUNDRED AND REPLACE THE THROTTLE BODY TO PREVENT INJURY OR DEATH.  *TR",
