        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING ACROSS COUNTRY IN MY 2000 XTERRA LAST SUMMER(2002), THE SPEEDOMETER AND ALL GAUGES ON DASH STOPPED WORKING. I WENT TO A NISSAN DEALER IN COLORADO AND THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO UNLESS IT STAYED STUCK. THE PROBLEM WAS THAT EVERY TIME I TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE AND TURNED IT BACK ON, IT WOULD WORK AGAIN.  FINALLY, A YEAR AND A HALF LATER WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON AN EXTREMELY BUSY ROAD, THE ENGINE SHUT OFF WHILE I WAS IN THE FAST LANE GOING 70 MPH. NOT ONLY DID I HAVE TO GLIDE ACROSS 3 LANES TO A SHOULDER, THERE WAS LITTLE SHOULDER TO PARK ON BECAUSE WE HAD A PREVIOUS SNOW STORM THE ROAD WAS NOT AS WIDE AS USUAL.  I HAD TO BE TOWED TO NISSAN AND WAIT 2 WEEKS FOR A FUEL SENDING UNIT BECAUSE THEY WERE ON NATIONAL BACK ORDER.  WHILE PERIODICALLY SPEAKING TO THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE AT DIFFERENT POINTS WITHIN THIS TWO WEEKS, HE WAS CONSTANTLY UPDATING ME ON HOW MANY MORE XTERRA'S WERE BEING TOWED IN WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  I AM APPALLED THAT NISSAN HAS NOT MADE AN EFFORT TO RECALL THIS PART OR TO INFORM THEIR CUSTOMERS OF THIS DANGER. THE ENGINE SHUTTING OFF WHILE DRIVING ON A BUSY FREEWAY IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION AND SOME ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN.*JB",
