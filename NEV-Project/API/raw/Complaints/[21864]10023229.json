        "summary": "IN LATE MAY OF 2003, THE DRIVER'S SEAT OF MY NISSAN PATHFINDER STOPPED WORKING AS FAR AS THE AUTOMATIC SEAT ADJUSTMENTS. I WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO MOVE THE SEAT FORWARD OR REVERSE USING THE SEAT'S AUTOMATIC SWITCH. THUS BEING STUCK IN A POSITION NOT EXACTLY THE WAY I WOULD NEED TO DRIVE. I CAN NOT MOVE THIS SEAT TO A PROPER AND SAFE AREA SO THAT I CAN OPERATE THE VEHICLE AS PRESCRIBED IN THE OWNER'S MANUAL. AS WITH ANY VEHICLE, THE SEAT SHOULD BE POSITIONED RELATIVE TO THE DRIVER'S ABILITY. I HAVE TO DRIVE CLOSER TO THE STEERING WHEEL THAT I WOULD LIKE. AS WELL AS MY GIRLFRIEND IS UNABLE TO DRIVE IT BECAUSE OF THE FACT IT WILL NOT MOVE FORWARD SO SHE CAN REACH THE PEDALS. SO IF I WAS TO BE HURT, SHE WOULD NOT HAVE A WAY TO GO. THIS IS COVERED IN THE NISSAN SERVICE BULLETIN NTB00095. THIS VEHICLE IS ONLY 2 YEARS OLD.  IT IS A 2001 NISSAN PATHFINDER. THE MOTOR FOR THIS SEAT SHOULD NOT BE MALFUNCTIONING THIS EARLY IN A VEHICLE'S LIFE. I TOOK THE SAID VEHICLE TO THE SHEEHY NISSAN DEALERSHIP WHICH IS LOCATED IN MANASSAS, VIRGINIA. THEY INDICATED THAT THIS WAS NOT A RECALL NOR A WARRANTY PART. I HAVE THE GOLD WARRANTY WHICH [XXX] NEARS COVERS EVERYTHING ELSE. ALSO IT COVERS A DRIVER'S SEAT ASSEMBLY BUT NOT THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OR AS I WAS INFORMED THIS KIT. I HAVE CONTACTED THE NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS OFFICE AND COMPLAINED AS WELL THAT THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND IF FOR SOME REASON I AM DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND THE SEAT MOVES TO THE VERY FRONT POSITION, I AM UNABLE TO OPERATE THE VEHICLE AND COULD CAUSE MORE DAMAGE TO MYSELF, THE VEHICLE AS WELL AS ANOTHER OBSTACLE OR VEHICLE.  WE HAVE HAD A 97 FORD THUNDERBIRD WITH A SERVICE BULLETIN AGAINST AND THE FORD DEALERSHIP AND FORD MOTOR COMPANY WAS GLAD TO CORRECT WITHOUT COST TO US. THIS WAS NOT A WARRANTY PART. THE VEHICLE AT THAT TIME WAS 6 YEARS OLD. I AM ASSUMING THAT NISSAN CORPORATION DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS AND SAFETY AS THIS WAS INDICATED THAT NISSAN WOULD NOT FIX AT THEIR COST. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.   *JB    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
