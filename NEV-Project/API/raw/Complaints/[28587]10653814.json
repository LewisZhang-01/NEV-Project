I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY DEALERSHIP, JERRY'S MITSUBISHI, IN PARKVILLE MD 21234 AND THEN THEY CANCELLED THE APPOINTMENT STATING THEY DO NOT HAVE THE PARTS AND HAVE NO DATE WHEN THEY ARE TO ARRIVE. I TRIED CALLING MITSUBISHI CUSTOMER RELATIONS 888-648-7820 AND THEIR AUTOMATED SYSTEM DOESN'T ALLOW NOR CAN I EVER SPEAK TO A CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE. I HAVE ALSO TRIED TO CONTACT NHTSA AT 1-888-327-4236 AND AGAIN HAVE NO WAY OF SPEAKING WITH A REPRESENTATIVE.    SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE ONLY AVENUE OF APPROACH IS TO SUBMIT THIS COMPLAINT WHICH IS NOT ONLY FOR THE RECALL BUT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE INABILITY TO CONTACT ANYONE LIVE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE DEALERSHIP. I SINCERELY HOPE THIS GETS ATTENTION.  *TR",
