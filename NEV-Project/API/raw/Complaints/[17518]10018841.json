I CONTACTED THE DEALER SEVERAL TIMES TO FIX THE PROBLEM, THEY AGREED TO REPLACE THE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS, STILL SMELLED AFTER I PICKED IT UP. CALLED THEIR 800# AND THEY SAID THE SMELL WILL DISAPPEAR AFTER ABOUT 7,000-8,000 MILES OF DRIVING. THIS WAS AT 5,000 MILES I CURRENTLY HAVE 11,000 AND THE SMELL IS NOT DISAPPEARING. THIS IS SUCH A POTENT SMELL THAT IT GIVES ME A HEADACHE AND I ALSO GET DIZZY FROM THESE TOXIC FUMES. THIS IS NOT THE TYPE OF PROBLEMS I SHOULD BE HAVING FOR SPENDING ALMOST $30,000 FOR A BRAND NEW CAR. ANY HELP OR ADVISE WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.  *JB",
