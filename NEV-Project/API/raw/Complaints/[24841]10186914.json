SO I SHUT THE CAR OFF TURNED IT BACK AND  STILL SAME NOISE WHEN I WENT TO BACK UP.  THIS IS A 2002 WITH UNDER 60,000 MILES AND HAS TRANSMISSION TROUBLE.  SAME AS THAT OTHER COMPLAINTS I'VE READ ON HERE.  BOOK SAYS TRANSMISSION SERVICE WHEN 100,000 MILES AND I DON'T BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE SO MANY PROBLEMS WITH A VEHICLE WITH LOW MILES AND AS MANY COMPLAINTS AS THERE HAS BEEN GM SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT AND THINK ABOUT A RECALL.  I RUN A DAYCARE AND SOMETIMES HAVE 5 KIDS IN THE CAR EXPLAIN THAT TO THE PARENTS IF THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HURT.  IT TIME FOR GM TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  *JB",
