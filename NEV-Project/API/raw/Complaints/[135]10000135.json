NOT ONLY DOES THE MOON ROOF LEAK THE FRONT WINDSHIELD HAS HAD A RATTLE IN IT EVER SINCE WE GOT IT. WE HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP 3 TIMES TO GET THE PROBLEMS FIXED AND EACH TIME IT COMES BACK THE MOON ROOF SEEMS TO LEAK EVEN WORSE. THE RATTLE IS STILL IN THE WINDSHIELD ALSO. WE HAVE BEEN TOLD NOW THAT WE SHOULD EXPECT THE MOON ROOF TO LEAK GOING THROUGH A HIGH PRESSURE CAR WASHES. THIS IS WHAT THE DEALERSHIP HAS TOLD US SINCE THEY CAN'T SEEM TO FIX THE PROBLEMS. THIS IS NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED WHEN WE PURCHACED THIS VEHICLE. THE PROBLEMS ARE STILL BEING ADDRESSED AND THE DEALERSHIP IS STILL TRYING TO FIX THE PROBLEMS.",
