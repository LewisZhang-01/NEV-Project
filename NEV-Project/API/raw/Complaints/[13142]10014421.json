THE SHIFT INDICATOR STOPPED BLINKING BUT THE CAR WOULD SHIFT VERY HARD. I TOOK IT TO HONDA AND THEY WARRANTED THE TRANSMISSION BECAUSE THE CAR ONLY HAD 65000  MILES THEY ALSO GAVE ME A RENTAL. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN FIXED OR WILL I HAVE THIS PROBLEM AGAIN AT 120000 MILES? *JB",
