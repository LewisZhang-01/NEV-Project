FOR THE CAMPAIGN WE WERE REFERRING TO, THEY TOLD US THE PART WOULD HAVE TO BE ORDERED WHICH WOULD TAKE 3 WEEKS. WE SUBSEQUENTLY CALLED ANOTHER DEALER WHO TOLD US THEY COULD DO THE TEMPORARY REPAIR THE NEXT DAY. IT APPEARS TO ME THAT CHAPMAN FORD WAS TRYING TO AVOID DOING THE TEMPORARY REPAIR. THE VEHICLE IS OVER 30K MILES AND ACCORDING TO THE RECALL SHOULD NOT BE DRIVEN UNTIL THE TEMPORARY REPAIR IS DONE, HENCE THE URGENT NEED FOR THE TEMP REPAIR TO BE DONE TIMELY.",
