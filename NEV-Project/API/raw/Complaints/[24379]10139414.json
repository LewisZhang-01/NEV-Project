THERE IS ABOUNCE AND  VIBRATION IN THE STEERING COLUMN WHILE DRIVING UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT IT BECAME  WORSE WHILE TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL LEFT OR RIGHT.  SOMETIMES THERE WAS A GRINDING NOISE COMING FROM THE STEERING COLUMN WHILE TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL.  THIS HAPPENED EVERY TIME THE CONTACT DROVE THE VEHICLE.  THERE WAS A REMEDY KIT AVAILABLE FROM CHEVROLET THAT IWASCOVERED UNDER WARRANTY OR THE CONTACT WOULD HAVE TO COVER THE EXPENSE.  WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY THIS KIT WAS INSTALLED IN APPROXIMATELY A YEAR AGO, BUT THE VEHICLE WAS  EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS AGAIN.  THE NEW RECOMMENDATION FROM CHEVROLET WAS TO REPLACE THE INTERMEDIATE STEERING SHAFT.  THE SERVICE DEALER SAID THE VEHICLE IWASOUT OF WARRANTY, AND THAT THERE WAS NO RECALL. THE CONTACT WOULD HAVE TO COVER THE COST OF THE REPAIR.  THE MANUFACTURER STATED THAT THEY WERE AWARE THERE WAS A PROBLEM, BUT IF THERE WAS NO RECALL AND THE VEHICLE IS NO LONGER U WAS NDER WARRANTY THERE WAS NOTHING THAT CCOULD  BE DONE, EXCEPT FOR THE CONTACT TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS.*AK",
