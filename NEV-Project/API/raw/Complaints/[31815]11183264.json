        "summary": "IT WAS NOTED SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASING THE VEHICLE THAT THE CAR WILL SHIFT REALLY HARD WHEN DOWNSHIFTING FROM 2ND TO 1ST.  THE HARD SHIFT WILL SOMETIMES CAUSE A JERKING MOTION IN THE CAR.  THIS PROBLEM CONTINUES TODAY.  I HAVE TAKEN THE CARE MANY TIMES TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THEY HAVE TOLD ME EACH TIME THAT EITHER A SOFTWARE UPDATED WAS NEEDED OR THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE ISSUE.  PLEASE NOTE THE ISSUE IS NOT EVERY TIME.  THE PROBLEM DOES COME AND GO.  LAST FRIDAY, 2/15, THE CAR WOULD NOT GO INTO REVERSE.  I WOULD PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE AND IT WAS AS IF I WERE STILL IN PARK.  AFTER A FEW TRIES, I RESTARTED THE CAR AND IT WENT INTO REVERSE WITH NO PROBLEM.  THE NEXT DAY SATURDAY 2/16, AFTER I PLACED THE CAR IN PARK, I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE AND THE CAR LUNGED FORWARD AS IF IT WERE STILL IN GEAR.  I AGAIN RESTARTED THE CAR, THIS TIME A FEW TIMES, JUST TO SEE IF THE CAR WOULD DO IT AGAIN.  IT DID NOT.  YESTERDAY, THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE AND WAS TAKEN IN FOR SERVICE, A NOISE WOULD COME FROM THE SHIFTER KNOB AREA EACH TIME THE BRAKE WAS PRESSED.  THE KNOW HAS BEEN REPLACED ONCE BEFORE BY BOB BAKER DEALERSHIP.  ON TOP OF THESE ISSUE, THE ELECTRONICS HAVE GONE OUT ON THE DASHBOARD WHERE THE CLIMATE CONTROL, RADIO, ETC ARE LOCATED.  I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TO TRY AND GET THIS ISSUES ADDRESS AT BOB BAKER DEALERSHIP.  I HAVE 20 PAGES OF SERVICE HISTORY ON THIS CAR, MOST OF IT ARE REGARDING THE VERY HARD DOWNSHIFTING.BELOW I WILL MARK THE DATE THE MOST RECENT ISSUE HAPPENED WITH THE CAR.  *TR",
