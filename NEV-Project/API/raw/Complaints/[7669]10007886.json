        "summary": "ON AUGUST 25F 2002 MY FIANCE' WAS DRIVING MY 2001 HYUNDAI TIBURON WHICH I HAD PURCHASED NEW IN FEBRUARY OF 2002.  HE WAS CUT OFF BY A PERSON DRIVING A CHEVY BLAZER.  THE ENTIRE FRONT END OF THE TIBURON STRUCK THE TRUCK IN THE REAR PASSENGER'S SIDE DOOR.  MY FIANCE' WAS DRIVING APPROXIMATLY 30-35 MILES AN HOUR AT IMPACT.  THE TIBURON INCURRED JUST UNDER $6000 IN DAMAGES INCLUDING REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION BECAUSE THE FORCE OF THE IMPACT CRACKED THE TRANSMISSION CASE.  I AM FILING THIS COMPLAINT BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT, THE AIRBAGS IN THE TIBURON NEVER INFLATED.  THE IMPACT WAS STRONG ENOUGH THAT MY FIANCE SUSTAINED INJURY TO HIS FOREHEAD AND CHEST WHEN THEY STRUCK THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE WINDSHIELD.  I FEEL THAT HIS INJURIES WOULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED BY THE AIRBAG DEPLOYING.  I CONTACTED HYUNDAI ASKING THEM TO DO AN INVESTIGATION AND WAS REFUSED TWICE.",
