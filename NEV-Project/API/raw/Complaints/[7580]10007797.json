NOT ONLY ARE MECHANICS REFUSING TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM (BECAUSE OF THE TYPE OF ENGINE), THEY ARE SAYING I WILL PROBABLY NEED A NEW ENGINE (UPWARDS OF $3500 IN COST).  SEVERAL MECHANICS EXPRESSED THAT THEY HAVE SEEN SEVERAL PEOPLE WITH THIS PROBLEM WHO HAVE THE 6 CYLINDER, 2.7 LITER ENGINE ON THIS YEAR, MAKE AND MODEL OF CAR.  BASICALLY, I WAS TOLD THAT WORKING ON THIS PROBLEM WITH THIS TYPE OF CAR IS A BIG HEADACHE, AND \"THEY WON'T TOUCH IT\".  WHY HASN'T THIS PROBLEM BEEN RECALLED?",
