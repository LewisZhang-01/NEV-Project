EVENTUALLY MY BRAKES RE PRESSURIZE BUT THIS TAKES TIME, THIS LAST EVENT TOOK 2.5 WEEKS FOR MY BRAKES TO \"COME BACK\". THIS IS ALSO NO THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED. I ALMOST HIT A GIRL CROSSING THE STREET, MY ABS KICKED IN, THEN MY BRAKES FAILED AND I HAD TO FLOOR THE BRAKE PEDAL TO STOP, I NEARLY HIT THE GIRL. THANKFULLY I REALIZED WHAT HAPPENED AND KNEW TO FLOOR MY BRAKE PEDAL.    FIRST INCIDENT: I WAS BRAKING TO A STOP AND MY TIRE HIT A RAISED MANHOLE COVER IN THE ROAD, WASN'T REAL HARD BUT ENOUGH THAT MY BRAKES \"FAILED\" AND I SKIDDED INTO THE INTERSECTION, THANKFULLY NO ONE WAS MOVING YET. MY BRAKES RECOVERED A COUPLE DAYS LATER.    SECOND INCIDENT: THE YOUNG GIRL I ALMOST HIT, I MENTIONED THIS IN THE ABOVE PARAGRAPH. HEADING TO WORK, DOING ABOUT 30, I SPACED OUT FOR A MIN, GIRL STARTS TO CROSS, I SLAM ON THE BRAKES.(YES, I KNOW, IT WAS BAD ALL AROUND). THE ABS KICKS IN, I START TO SLOW, THEN I LOSE 99% OF MY BRAKES AND I HAVE TO FLOOR MY PEDAL TO STOP FROM HITTING HER. I CAME WITHIN 5 FEET OF THE GIRL.    THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER INSTANCES BUT I DON'T REMEMBER SPECIFICS. ALTHOUGH, THE TWO EVENTS ABOVE, THE FIRST ONE WAS ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO, THE SECOND WAS 2 WEEKS AGO.",
