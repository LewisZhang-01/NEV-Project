I HAVE HAD IT TOWED 2 TIMES TO THE DEALER AND OF COURSE ONCE THEY GET THE VEHICLE THERE IT STARTS. THEY THEN TELL ME THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT THEY CAN DO FOR ME. I CALLED CHRYSLER AND THEY SAID THEY WERE UNAWARE OF THE PROBLEM WHICH SEEMS SO FUNNY TO ME CAUSE EVERY WHERE I READ IT IS SOMETHING ABOUT THE VEHICLE INTERMITTENTLY NOT STARTING. THIS IS MY FIRST AND LAST CHRYSLER PRODUCT I WILL EVER OWN. HOW MANY COMPLAINTS DO YOU NEED BEFORE THEY ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING?   *JS",
