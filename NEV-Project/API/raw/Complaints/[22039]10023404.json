FINALLY AN ACCIDENT IN NOV 2002.AFTER 7 MONTHS THE REPAIRS COMPLETE BUT I HAD TO PAY FOR NEW HUBS EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A BRAKE ISSUE.AFTER RESEARCH I FIND THAT THE HUBS MAY BE MADE IMPROPERLY. THE WRECK WAS CAUSED BY A MISALIGNED TONE RING OR ABS SENSOR.I BELIEVE THE HUBS ARE A PART OF THIS BUT THE DEALER DENIES IT.MY INSURANCE COVERED MOST OF THE REPAIRS WEAVER AUTO REPAIRED MANY HOSES AND THE ENGINE OIL COOLANT LINESAND ON THE 18TH OF JUNE 2003,FIRST DAY DRIVING THE TRUCK AFTER THE REPAIRS MY ENGINE ACTED LIKE IT BLEW. NOW THEY CLAIM THAT IT MAY HAVE SPUN 2 BEARINGS.( I LEARNED THIS CAN BE CAUSED BY OIL/RADIATOR DAMAGE) ( I DROVE THE TRUCK 80 MILES TOTAL AFTER THE REPAIRS.)I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE DEALER AS WELL AS GMC SINCE THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE OF THE TRUCK IN 1998 WHEN I HAD TO REPLACE THE FIRST SET OF BRAKES PREMATURELY,THEY DENIED ANY PROBLEMS. A WHILE DOWN THE ROAD I LEARNED OF A RECALL ON THIS YEAR AND MODEL TRUCK DUE TO THE ABS SYSTEM. I CONTACTED THEM AND WAS TOLD MY TRUCK WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL. THIS TRUCK DOES HAVE A BRAKE PROBLEM I HAVE COMPLAINED AND TAKENM IT IN TO BE CHECKED CONSTANTLY.  FINANCIALLY DRAINED, I AM AT MY WITS END.   *NLM",
