BRAKING CAUSES A SAFETY HAZARD, CAR AND STEERING WHEEL SHAKES VIOLENTLY.  HAD ROTORS TURNED AT LEAST FOUR TIMES AND NEW PADS.  DAIMLER-CHRYSLER IS AWARE THEY HAVE PUT INFERIOR BRAKES ON THEIR VEHICLES BUT REFUSE TO ADMIT IT.   PRESSURE NEEDS TO BE PUT ON THIS COMPANY.  I AM PURCHASING A WHOLE NEW SET OF RAYBESTOS ROTORS AND PADS AS I AM SICK OF THIS PROBLEM.  I HAVE READ NUMEROUS MAYBE HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE BRAKES, YET DAIMLER-CHRYSLER REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THERE IS A PROBLEM.    *NLM",
