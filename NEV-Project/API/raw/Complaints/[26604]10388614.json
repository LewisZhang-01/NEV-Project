        "summary": "THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN DRIVEN ONLY ABOUT 26,000 MILES. I BOUGHT IT BRAND NEW FROM MANHATTAN JAGUAR DEALERSHIP IN BETHESDA MD. AND IS STILL UNDER AN EXTENDED WARRANTY. OVER THE LAST 7 YEARS THAT I HAVE OWNED THIS CAR I HAVE HAD 3 INCIDENTS OF SUDDEN ACCELERATION. THE FIRST HAPPENED ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO AS I CAME TO A RED TRAFFIC LIGHT. I APPLIED THE BRAKE AND THE VEHICLE SLOWED DOWN. BUT THEN THE ENGINE SUDDENLY MADE A ROARING SOUND AND THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO ACCELERATE. AS I WAS PUSHING THE BRAKE I ALSO PUSHED THE GEAR TO THE \"P\" AND THE VEHICLE STOPPED ABOUT 6 FEET BEYOND THE STOPPING LINE. THE SECOND TIME I WAS ACTUALLY STOPPED TO MAKE A TURN AND AGAIN SUDDENLY THE ENGINE MADE A ROARING SOUND AND THE VEHICLE BEGAN A SUDDEN ACCELERATION.. MY WIFE WAS SITTING NEXT TO ME AND AGAIN I APPLIED THE BRAKE AND IMMEDIATELY PUSH THE GEAR TO \"P\". BOTH OF INCIDENTS WERE REPORTED TO THE DEALER TO NO AVAIL. THE LAST INCIDENT HAPPENED ON JANUARY 13, 2011 AS I WAS STOPPED 5-6 FEET FROM THE CAR AHEAD OF ME IN A BUSY TRAFFIC. AGAIN ALL THE SUDDEN IT WAS A ROARING SOUND AND THE VEHICLE BEGAN THE SUDDEN ACCELERATION DESPITE MY PUSHING ON THE BRAKE. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN ME AND THE FRONT CAR WAS TOO SHORT; SO BEFORE I COULD STOPPED THE CAR, I HIT THE REAR END OF THE VEHICLE STOPPED AHEAD OF ME. MY INSURANCE PAID $725 TO FIX THE DAMAGES TO THE REAR BUMPER OF THAT CAR. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AGAIN AND THEY  KEPT IT FOR THREE DAYS CLAIMING THAT SINCE THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE ACCELERATION THEY COULD NOT DO ANYTHING FOR ME. I ALSO DROVE THE CAR WITH ONE OF THE DEALERS STAFF. THE PURPOSE I GUESS WAS FOR ME TO REPLICATE THE ACCELERATION AS IF THE PREVIOUS CASES WERE DONE ON PURPOSE. THIS CAR ALSO HAD A  PROBLEM WITH THE SIDE MIRRORS. THEY WOULD MOVE AS I WAS DRIVING. AFTER SOME 10 TIMES COMPLAINT, FINALLY THEY SAID A GADGET UNDER THE DRIVER'S SEAT WAS THE CULPRIT AND FINALLY TOOK CARE OF",
