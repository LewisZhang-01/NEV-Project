I TRIED TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD QUICKLY BUT I HAD NO ENGINE POWER. I COASTED TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD AND CALLED MY HUSBAND TO PICK ME UP. I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO MY MECHANIC AND HE ADVISED US THAT THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FLUID HAD CONTAMINATED THE ANTI-FREEZE AND VICE VERSA AND THAT I'D NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION AND RADIATOR INSTALLED FOR $5500.00. HE ALSO ADDED THAT NISSAN HAD JUST LOST A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT TO REPAIR THE VEHICLES AFFECTED BUT THE CATCH IS THAT YOUR VEHICLE CAN NOT HAVE OVER 100,000 MILES ON IT. FROM MY RESEARCH IN THE FORUMS, THE ISSUE DOES NOT ARISE UNTIL THE VEHICLE MILEAGE EXCEEDS 100,000, SO WE'RE BASICALLY SCREWED FOR REPAIRS ON OUR NISSANS WITH 100,001 MILES OR MORE. I'M DOUBLE SCREWED AS I HAVE 2 2006 NISSAN'S.  MY OTHER VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY INOPERABLE DUE TO ATF CONTAMINATION.",
