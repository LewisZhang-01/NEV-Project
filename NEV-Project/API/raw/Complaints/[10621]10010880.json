        "summary": "I WAS THE OWNER OF A 1999 DODGE INTREPID, THAT WAS COMPLETELY WRECKED AT 36,000 MILES AFTER EXPERIENCING SUDDEN LOSS OF STEERING CONTROL PRIOR TO THE WRECK, MY DEALER ASSURED ME OVER AND OVER THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE ALTHOUGH I WAS VERY CONCERNED AND PRETENDED TO KNOW NOTHING ABOUT STEERING PROBLEMS WITH THESE VEHICLES. PRIOR TO THE TOTAL VEHICLE LOSS, THE ENGINE BLEW UP WITH A ROD KNOCK AT ABOUT 33,000 MILES AND HAD TO BE REPLACED, THE TRANSMISSION HAD TO BE OVERHAULED AFTER IT FAILED, THE INPUT AND OUTPUT SPEED SENSORS BOTH FAILED AND MUCH MORE. THIS IS JUST 1 OF 2 DEFECTIVE DAIMLER CHRYSLER VEHICLES I HAVE OWNED AND DAIMLER CHRYSLER ACCEPTS NO RESPONSIBILITY. MANY OF THESE VEHICLES ARE DEFECTIVE AND DO NOT HOLD UP REASONABLY. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS WITH A 15 YEAR OLD VEHICLE WITH OVER 220,000 MILES ON IT.    I WOULD LIKE TO INFORM CONSUMERS THAT MY WEBSITE AGAINST CHRYSLER FOR ONGOING PREMATURE DODGE, CHRYSLER ENGINE, STEERING, TRANSMISSION FAILURES AND MORE IS NOW WWW.DAIMLERCHRYSLERVEHICLEPROBLEMS.COM. WE HAVE REFERRED MANY TO THE NHTSA AND WE HOPE THAT THE NHTSA WILL POST THIS TO REFER OTHERS TO OUR SITE WHO HAVE NOT YET SEEN OUR SITE. AT THIS WEBSITE YOU WILL SEE ACCIDENT PICTURES AND COMPLAINTS FROM CONSUMERS AFTER SUDDEN LOSS OF STEERING CONTROL. WE ALSO HAVE PICTURES OF THE COMMON CHRYSLER ENGINE INTERNAL OIL SLUDGE BUILDUP AND DAMAGE FROM TIMING CHAINS THAT HAVE BROKE THROUGH THESE ENGINES AFTER TENSIONER FAILURES. WE ALSO HAVE MANY PREMATURE TRANSMISSION FAILURE COMPLAINTS. IF YOU  HAVE EVIDENCE OF THESE PROBLEMS, PICTURES OR A COMPLAINT TO BE POSTED PLEASE ALSO VISIT WWW.DAIMLERCHRYSLERVEHICLEPROBLEMS.COM AND FIND OUT WHAT DAIMLERCHRYSLER DOES NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW.    *JB",
