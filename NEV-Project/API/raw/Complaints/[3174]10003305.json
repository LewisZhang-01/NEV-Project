RESEARCH ON THE VWVORTEX.COM WEBSITE REVEALED THERE IS A LARGE HISTORY OF PROBLEMS WITH THESE COIL PACKS WHICH CAN FAIL AT ANY TIME RENDERING THE VEHICLE UNDRIVEABLE.  THERE IS CURRENTLY A SHORTAGE OF THIS PART (PART # 06B-905-115-J COIL) DUE TO THE VOLUME OF VEHICLES THAT HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM.  VWVORTEX IS RECOMMENDING OWNERS CONTACT NHTSA TO FACILITATE A RECALL OF COIL PACKS AS VW IS UNWILLING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AT THIS TIME.  IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE THEY CAN FAIL WHILE DRIVING RESULTING IN LOSS OF CONTROL OF  THE VEHICLE.",
