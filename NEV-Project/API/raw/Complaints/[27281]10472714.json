THE VISOR JUST FLOPS DOWN, IMPAIRING VISION WHILE DRIVING; THE VISOR HAD TO BE TAKEN DOWN, THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN ON A CAR WITH ONLY 48,000 MILES. THIS HAPPENED ABOUT AUGUST 23, 2012. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, AND SHOULD BE REPLACED BY TOYOTA FOR FREE, NOT $200+ DOLLARS. I WILL NOT PAY THE DEALER FEE, SO THE PROBLEM STILL HAS NOT BEEN FIXED.  *TR",
