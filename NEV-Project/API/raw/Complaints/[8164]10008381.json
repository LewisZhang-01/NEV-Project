(I THINK HE CALLED IT \"PISTON SLAM\") HAVE HEARD OF OTHERS WITH SAME 3.1 ENGINE DYING ANYWHERE BETWEEN 60 AND 80 THOUSAND MILES. WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY $500 FOR THEM TO LOOK AT IT, AND THEN ANOTHER $3500 FOR A NEW ENGINE?  YES, THE CAR WENT OUT OF WARRANTY IN DEC. BUT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A PRE-EXISTING PROBLEM THAT SHOULD BE UNDER RECALL.   *NLM",
