THE DEALER SAID IN BOTH INSTANCES THAT THIS WAS THE RESULT OF A BAD IGNITION COIL. THE IGNITION COIL WAS REPLACED EACH TIME. THE ISSUE IS NOW PRESENTING ITSELF A THIRD TIME, BUT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT HAS NOT COME ON. I BELIEVE THIS VEHICLE MAY HAVE BEEN MISSED IN THE RECENT RECALL FOR THE ENGINE ISSUES.",
