IN SPRING 2008, FUEL PUMP REPLACED DUE TO CAR (A) GETTING POOR GAS MILEAGE (B) TAKING 2-3 CRANKS TO START (C) FEELING LIKE NO POWER WAS GETTING TO THE PEDAL.  STARTED HAVING ISSUES AGAIN FEBRUARY 2009.  WENT ON A TRIP MARCH 2009 FOR TWO WEEKS.  WHEN I RETURNED, THE CAR TOOK 5 MINUTES TO START WITH A FULL TANK OF GAS AFTER CRANKING AT LEAST 5 OR 6 TIMES.  TAKING TO THE DEALER NEXT WEEK.  TODAY, STARTED FINE, BUT NO POWER BEHIND PEDAL AND POOR MILEAGE.  SHOULD HAVE KEPT MY BEAT UP TRUCK, WHICH WAS JUST AS RELIABLE. *TR",
