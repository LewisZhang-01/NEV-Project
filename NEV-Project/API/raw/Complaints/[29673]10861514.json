        "summary": "I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE (15V-793) FROM FORD IN JANUARY 2016 ABOUT THE CANISTER PURGE VALVE, VAPOR CANISTER, GAS TANK, AND POWER CONTROL MODULE ON MY 2010 MERCURY MILAN.  I TOOK IT TO THE FORD DEALER AND THEY DID AN ELECTRONIC TEST AND SAID IT WAS OK.  ONE MONTH LATER THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE CODE SAID THE PROBLEM WAS THE PRIOR RECALLED CANISTER PURGE VALVE.  TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER AND THEY DID THEIR ELECTRONIC TEST AGAIN AND SAID IT WAS THE GAS TANK FILL TUBE VALVE.  FOUR DAYS LATER THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN AND THE CODES AGAIN SAID IT WAS THE CANISTER PURGE VALVE.  THIS TIME THE DEALER DID AS I ASKED THEM AND MECHANICALLY CHECKED THE VALVE, AND DISCOVERED THAT IT AND THE VAPOR CANISTER HAD FAILED.  HOWEVER, FORD WILL NOT COVER THE REPAIR.  IS THIS ALLOWED?  I WILL MAIL A LETTER WITH MORE DETAIL.  AFTER RESEARCHING THE ISSUE, THIS PARTICULAR VALVE COMMONLY FAILED BY STICKING OPEN OR CLOSED AND THE ONLY WAY TO DETECT IT, WAS TO DO A MECHANICAL TEST BY TAKING THE HOSES OFF AND CHECKING FOR PRESSURE OR VACUUM. THE DEALER DID NOT PERFORM THE TEST PROPERLY. UPDATED 05/31/16.*JB",
