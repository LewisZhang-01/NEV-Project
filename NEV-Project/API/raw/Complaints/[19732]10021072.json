I HAD MY OIL CHANGED & THE TIRES ROTATED LAST WEEK & WHILE THEY WERE UNDER THE CAR I HAD THEM TO LOOK AT THE REAR SUSPENSION, THEY SAID IT NEEDED A NEW KNUCKLE ASSEMBLY & THE DEALER KNEW BETTER THAN REPLACE REAR STRUTS WITH THIS TYPE OF NOISE.  IT SEEMS THAT NOURSE CADILLAC IN DELAWARE RAN UP A BIG TAB & BILLED IT TO CADILLAC (WARRANTY) AND AS SOON AS THEY MADE THEIR MONEY THEY WANTED NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH THE CAR SO NOW I AM STUCK.  A CAR OF THIS MAGNITUDE & PRICE SHOULD NOT HAVE REAR COMPONENTS WEARING LIKE THIS, I ONLY HAVE 77,000 MILES ON THE CAR & I DO NOT DRIVE IT HARD....WHAT DO I DO?*AK",
