DEALER KEEPS TELLING ME THERE IS NO PROBLEM/CANNOT DUPLICATE, 4 INCIDENTS, THIS IS VERY FREIGHTING. ESPECIALLY IN HEAVY TRAFFIC & CANNOT GET OFF THE ROAD FAST. BRAKES WEAR BETWEEN 16000 AND 18000 MILES WITH NORMAL DRIVING. THE MOTOR BELT HAD TO BE REPLACED AT 22000 MILES. THIS NEVER HAPPENED SO SOON WITH ANY VEHICLE I HAVE EVER OWNED. REPAIRS AND SERVICES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE, MANY SAFETY RECALLS AND PRODUCT WARNINGS THAT TAKE TIME TO REPAIR. THE DEALER HAS A PROBLEM MAKING SURE THE PARTS ARE AVAILABLE WHEN I MAKE AN APPOINTMENT. THE WHEEL BEARINGS HAVE BEEN REPLACED SEVERAL TIMES AND SOUND LIKE THEY MAY BE GOING BAD AGAIN! I DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE. WHAT IF SOMETHING FAILS WHILE MYSELF OR MY FAMILY ARE IN THIS VEHICLE. THIS VEHICLE HAS DEPRECIATED AT SUCH A DRASTIC RATE, THAT I WOULD BE WISE TO TRADE IT FOR ANOTHER VEHICLE. I FEEL IT IS IN DIRECT RELATION  TO ALL THE SAFETY ISSUES WITH THIS VEHICLE. *PH    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**763169",
