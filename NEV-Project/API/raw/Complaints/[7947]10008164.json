        "summary": "MY FINGER WAS PARTIALLY AMUPUTATED - SURGERY REQUIRED.  I HAD BEEN STANDING OUTSIDE OF MY PARKED CAR WHEN THE DOOR CLOSED ON MY FINGER. WHEN THE CAR WAS BROUGHT INTO THE DEALERSHIP REPAIR FOLLOWING THE INJURY BECASUE SEVERAL FRIENDS SAID THE CAR DOOR WAS NOT CLOSING PROPERLY, THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT MY INNER CAR DOOR MOLDING HAD TO BE REPLACED ON THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE DOORS.  FROM THE BEGINNING OF MY LEASE OF THE C-240, 2002 AUTO THERE WERE AT LEAST THREE  OTHER INCIDENTS WHEN THE CAR DOORS NEEDED REPAIR.  ONCE AT MY HOME BECAUSE  THE DOORS WOULD NOT OPEN AND TWICE AT THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE OF THE DOOR PROBLEM.  AFTER MY SURGERY, I APPROACHED THE DEALERSHIP AND MERCEDES USA TELLING THEM  THAT I WANTED RECALL INFORMATION AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE ELSE  WAS IN HARM'S WAY - BUT THEY HAVE BASICALLY BEEN MEAN SPIRITED AND RUDE.  THEY HAVE NOT FIXED MY CAR AND HAVE NOT BEEN COOPERATIVE IN ALLOWING ME TO GET INFORMATION.  I WAS ASKED TO COME TO THE DEALERSHIP AND MEET WITH THE OPERATIONS AND PARTS REGIONAL MANAGER,ERIC ERDENLANDER, FROM PARISIPANY, NJ.  HE WAS INSULTING, RUDE AND COMPLETELY UNWILLING TO DISCUSS THE MATTER IN A DIGNIFIED MANNER.   I WAS LATER CALLED BY THE  SHOWROOM OWNER OF CONTEMPORARY MOTOR CARS OF LITTLE SILVER, NEW JERSEY,SCOTT COLEMAN, WHO APOLOGIZED.  I AM GOING TO OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY EVERYDAY FOR THE LAST FOUR WEEKS.  I HAVE HAD A PIN IN MY FINGER AND MICROSURGERY INCLUDING A SEVERE CRUSH INJURY.  I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY I AM NOT GETTING SOME FORM OF COOPERATION FROM MERCEDES BENZ USA.   ARE THEY TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING? OR DO THEY SIMPLY NOT CARE?  ALL OF THEIR ADS CLAIM THEY ARE CUSTOMER RELATIONS SAAVY.  I HAVE YET TO SEE MY INCIDENT BEING HANDLED WITH ANY OUNCE OF  CREDIBILTY.  I WOULD APPRECIATE THE FACTS GOING ON RECORD AND SOMEONE TAKING INTEREST IN THE PROBLEMS WITH THE DOORS FROM THE BEGINNING OF MY LEASE UNTIL THE TIME I NEARLY LOST MY FINGER IN THIS SEVERE CRUSH INJURY.  *JB",
