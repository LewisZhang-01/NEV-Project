THE CAR STILL HAD POWER AND WAS ON, BUT THERE WAS NO THROTTLE WHEN I PUSHED THE GAS. THE ENGINE LIGHT AND A LITTLE WRENCH CAME ON. I PUT IT IN PARK, TURNED IT OFF, RESTARTED IT, AND IT STILL HAD NO ENGINE THROTTLE TO IT. BUT THE CAR HAD A SMALL AMOUNT OF POWER, LIKE I WAS COASTING ALONG, SO THAT I COULD GET THROUGH THE STOP LIGHT AND MAKE IT TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. EVERY TIME I TRIED THE GAS PEDAL THOUGH, THERE WAS NO RESPONSE; IT WENT TO THE FLOOR. I WAS AT THE LIGHT BY MY NEIGHBORHOOD, RIGHT BY THE TRAIN TRACKS. THANK GOD I HAD ENOUGH POWER TO GET THROUGH THAT!  *TR",
