THE CARPETING WAS REPLACED DURING  THE SECOND REPAIR BECAUSE OF MILDEW SMELL. THE CAR IS NOW LEAKING AGAIN FOR THE FORTH TIME AND THE CARPETING IS SATURATED UNDER THE FRONT SEATS. IT'S BEEN LEAKING SINCE I FIRST BOUGHT IT BRAND NEW. I WANTED TO RETURN THE CAR THE FIRST TIME BUT THE DEALERSHIP WOULDN'T TAKE IT BACK, SAYING THEY COULD REPAIR IT. THERE WAS A SERVICE BULLETIN OUT ON THIS MODEL BECAUSE OF LEAKING PROBLEMS. THREE TRIES AND IT'S STILL NOT FIXED.  *JB",
