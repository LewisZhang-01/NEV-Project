        "summary": "I OWN A FORD F150 TRUCK BOPOUGHT NEW IN MARCH OF 1997.  I RECENTLY EXPERIENCED A LOW TIRE AND THE SERVICE PERSON SAID THAT THE WHEEL WAS LEAKING AIR AND SHOWED ME THE PROBLEM.  THE AREA AROUND THE VALVE STEM WAS VERY RUSTY AND WAS LEAKING AIR THROUGH THE STEEL MATERIAL OF THE WHEEL.  I'VE NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN TO ANY OF THE MANY VEHICLES OWNED BY ME IN THE PAST.  A QUESTION TO THE LOCAL DEALER INDICATED NO RECALLS OR SERVICE BULLETINS FROM FORD REGARDING THIS MATTER.  I CONSIDER THIS TO SOME DEGREE A SAFETY ISSUE SINCE LOW TIRE PRESSURE CONTRIBUTES TO THE POSSIBILITY OF ACCIDENTS.  I HAVE THREE OTHER WHEELS THAT MAY WELL BE AFFECTED.  I HAVE YET TO CONTACT THE COMPANY DUE TO THE NATURE OF BUSINESS DURING THE HOLIDAYS.  I WILL APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS PROBLEM AND PERHAPS INVESTIGATING WHETHER IT IS WIDESPREAD OF NOT.  THANKS MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.",
