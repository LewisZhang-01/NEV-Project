THE METAL OF THE FRAME, AS IT WAS DESIGNED AND MANUFACTURED, FAILED FROM METAL FATIGUE.  WHEN IT DID, THERE WAS NOTHING HOLDING THE FRONT OF THE SEAT TO THE FLOOR BOARD.  I FLEW INTO THE BACK SEAT, MY HANDS WERE RIPPED FROM THE WHEEL, AND I COULD NO LONGER REACH THE PEDALS.  I STRUGGLED TO MANEUVER MYSELF BACK INTO A POSITION WHERE I COULD REGAIN CONTROL OF MY CAR.  THANKFULLY, IT WAS VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING, AND THERE WERE NO OTHER VEHICLES OR PEDESTRIANS LOCATED CLOSE TO MY CAR.  AS OF THIS POINT, NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO FIX THE CAR.*JB",
