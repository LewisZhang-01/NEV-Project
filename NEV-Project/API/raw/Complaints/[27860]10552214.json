SINCE THE UPDATE, MY VEHICLE MAKES A LOUD NOISE WHEN TURNING THE ENGINE OFF AND THEN A THUMP SOUND. WAS TOLD THAT THE NOISE IS COMING FROM THE AIR INJECTION PUMPS THAT WERE AFFECTED FROM THE DOE UPDATE. TOYOTA WILL NOT GIVE ME ANY DOCUMENTATION ON THE RECALL FOR MY VEHICLE THAT AFFECTS THE EMISSION CONTROL EJECTOR TO FAIL AND THE VEHICLE GOING INTO FAIL SAFE MODE. TOYOTA REPRESENTATIVES ARE TELLING ME THAT THE NOISE IS NORMAL AND IS SUPPOSE TO BE THERE. THIS NOISE WAS NOT PRESENT BEFORE THE UPDATE AND I DO NOT FEEL THAT THE VEHICLE IS SAFE WHEN IT IS EXTREMELY SECRETIVE ABOUT THE RECALL OR THE UPDATE THAT IS BEING PERFORMED ON THE VEHICLE DUE TO THE RECALL. MY VEHICLE MAKES NOISES THAT DO NOT SOUND RIGHT. I DID NOT PURCHASE THE CAR MAKING ALL OF THIS NOISE AND I WANT THE VEHICLE TO PERFORM AND FUNCTION AS IT DID WHEN I PURCHASED IT.  *TR",
