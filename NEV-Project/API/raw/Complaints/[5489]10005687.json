        "summary": "CHANGED ENGINE OIL AS DIRECTED BY TOYOTA DEALER ON MY NEW 2000 TOYOTA AVALON (EVERY 3,000 MILES).  WHITE SMOKE STARTED COMING FROM EXHAUST IN LATE 2001.  TOOK IT IN TO TOYOTA SERVICE DEPT.  WAS ACCUSED OF NOT KEEPING UP  ROUTINE MAINTENANCE (OIL CHANGES) ON THE VEHICLE, AS SLUDGE HAD BUILT UP UNDER VALVE COVER AND IN ENGINE.  WAS TOTALLY LIVID AT THIS UNTRUE ACCUSATION.  WAS TOLD I NEEDED $4,000 TO REPAIR.  I HAD TO TRADE THE VEHICLE IN ON A NEW TOYOTA VEHICLE -- STARTING AT $4,000 IN THE RED.  FOR EXAMPLE, NEW VEHICLE WAS APPROXIMATELY $26,000.  TO THAT TOYOTA ADDED THE $4,000 TO IT.  I NOW OWE $30,000 ON A VEHICLE WORTH MUCH MUCH LESS.  I'M ENRAGED AND WANT A $4,000 CREDIT BACK TO MY BALANCE ON MY NEW VEHICLE AFTER LEARNING OF THE OBVIOUS RELEVATION THAT TOYOTA IS TO BLAME FOR A FAULTY ENGINE PROBLEM ON MANY OF ITS VEHICLES.  I WORK FOR A LAW FIRM AND WILL STOP AT NOTHING SHORT OF THIS OUTCOME.  THANK YOU.",
