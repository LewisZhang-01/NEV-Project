I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIRS, THEY HAD THE CAR FOR APPROX. 1.5 WEEKS, THEY SAY THAT THEY COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE ISSUE. I TOLD THEM THAT THE ROADS IN THE CITY WERE STRAIGHT, YOU WOULDN'T FEEL IT THERE. THAT YOU NEEDED TO DRIVE IT ON A WINDY COUNTRY ROAD. THEY DIDN'T DO SO. THEY WOULDN'T EVEN TAKE THE SEAT OUT AND INVESTIGATE IT. I PICKED UP MY CAR AND AS SOON AS I GOT HOME TO MY AREA (COUNTRY, WITH WINDING ROADS), THE SEAT IS DOING IT AGAIN. IT IS A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING.",
