THIS VEHICLE CANNOT GO THROUGH ANOTHER WINTER.    MANY COMPLAINTS ON LINE ABOUT THIS SAME ISSUE WITH HANKOOK TIRES ON FORD EXPLORERS.   HANKOOK OR FORD NEED TO STEP UP BEFORE MAJOR PROBLEMS OCCCUR.   SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE REPLACING TIRES THAT ARE RATED FOR 50,000 MILES WHEN THEY ARE UNDER 20,000.   HAVE MAINTAINED THIS VEHICLE REGULARLY WITH CORRECT TIRE PRESSURE AND TIRE ROTATIONS.
