        "summary": "THE NEW HID HEADLIGHTS IN APPROACHING VEHICLES ON 2 LANE HIGHWAYS HAVE CAUSED ME TO BE UNABLE TO SEE TEMPORARILY.  EVEN WITH MORE THAN 25 YEARS DRIVING EXPERIENCE, LOOKING AWAY DOES NOT SEEM TO HELP.  I HAVE SPOKEN TO MY OPTOMETRIST, BUT HE SAYS THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO TO HELP.   EVERYONE I HAVE SPOKEN TO AGREES THAT THEY HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING WHEN THE APPROACHING VEHICLE HAS HID LIGHTS.  IT APPEARS THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE TO ME AND NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE NHTSA.  THERE SEEMS TO BE MORE AND MORE VEHICLES WITH HID LIGHTS.  HID LIGHTS SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED FOR HIGHWAY USE.  THANK YOU.    *NLM",
