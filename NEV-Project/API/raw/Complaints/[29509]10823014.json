IT HAPPENS MOSTLY IN TRAFFIC AT LOWER SPEEDS, AND NOT IT IS HAVING PROBLEMS IN HIGHER SPEEDS. I HAVE ALMOST HIT A FEW PEOPLE BECAUSE IT WILL SUDDENLY JERK FORWARD WHEN IT SHIFTS VIOLENTLY. NOTHING FORD OR OTHER MECHANICS HAVE DONE TO FIX IT HAVE HELPED, AND CARMAX JUST LAUGHS AND SENDS ME AWAY WHEN I GO BACK TO THEM. THIS CAR HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM EVERYDAY SINCE I GOT IT.",
