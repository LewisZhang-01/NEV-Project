TURNED IT BACK ON AND IT RANNED FINE. NOT MORE THAN 5 MINUTES ITS WAS BACK NO ACCELERATION. SO THANK GOD I WAS ABLE TO USE THE FORCE FROM THE HILL TO CRUISE ON HOME ON THE BACK ROADS. THE CAR IS ONLY 3 YEARS OLD AT 79,000 MILES. SO NO WARRANTY!!! IT HAS TO BE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP! NEW VEHICLE SHOULD NOT BE HAVING PROBLEMS LIKE THIS!!!!",
