I HAVE NOT NOTICED THEM BECOMING UNCLIPPED AT THE SAME TIME.  IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME THAT THIS MAYBE A PROBLEM UNTIL I SAW THE NEWS REPORT ON WPVI-CHANNEL 6 IN PHILADELPHIA, PA.  I AM NOT SURE OF THE EXACT INCIDENT DATES.  I DO RECALL AT LEAST TWO INCIDENTS WHEN TAKING MY CHILDREN OUT OF THE CAR, I NOTICED THAT THE ONE OF THE SEATS HAD BECOME DISCONNECTED.  I THOUGHT IT WAS UNUSUAL, BUT NEVER REPORTED THE INCIDENT.   *NLM",
