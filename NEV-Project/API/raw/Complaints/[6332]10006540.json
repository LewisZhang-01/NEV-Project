THE WRECKER PERSON AND THE STATE TROOPER BOTH SEEMED TO THINK AIR BAGS ON RANGERS DID NOT DEPLOY EASILY. I CONTACTED FORD WITH THE IDEA OF PROVIDING USEFUL DATA ABOUT THEIR VEHICLE. I AM NOT SUING FORD OR THE LIKES JUST TRYING  TO REPORT WHAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM. FORD HAS RESPONDED BY INFORMING ME THAT MY INSURANCE CARRIER CAN SUBROGATE FORD IF THEY FEEL FORD HAS RESPONSIBILITY. MY CONCERN IS THAT SOMEONE INVESTIGATE THOSE AIR BAGS ON FORD RANGERS ARE DEPLOYING IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER. THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED AND APPARENTLY FORD DOES NOT PLAN TO DO IT.
