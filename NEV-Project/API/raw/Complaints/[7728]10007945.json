        "summary": "I PURCHASED OUR 2002 DODGE GRAND CARAVAN ON 4-1-2002 AND IT WAS IN THE SHOP THE FIRST TIME FOR THE POWER STEERING COOLER AND HOSES LEAKING ON 4-25-2002.  THE DEALER FIXED IT AND IT WAS LEAKING AGAIN ON 4-29-2002, THEN 4-30-2002, THEN 5-2-2002.  THE WEATHER GOT WARMER SO IT DIDN'T SEEM TO LEAK.  THEN IT STARTED GETTING COLD AGAIN IN THE FALL AND IT STARTED LEAKING AGAIN.  SEEMS WHEN THE TEMP DROPS BELOW 21 DEGREES, IT LEAKS.  CHRYSLER SENT A FACTORY ENGINEER TO THE DEALERSHIP TO INVESTIGATE WHY IT COULDN'T BE FIXED.  HE STATED THAT CHRYSLER IS HAVING EXTREME DIFFICULTY WITH THE POWER STEERING COOLERS AND HOSES LEAKING IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY (COLDER CLIMATES.)  HE ALSO STATED THAT IT CAN NOT BE FIXED.  THIS IS A DANGEROUS PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE IF I LOSE CONTROL OF MY VEHICLE BECAUSE OF LOSS OF FLUID IN THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM, I COULD END UP IN ON-COMING TRAFFIC AND CAUSE A HORRIFIC ACCIDENT POSSSIBLY RESULTING IN DEATH.  AFTER MONTHS OF THEM TRYING TO FIX IT, I FINALLY SAID ENOUGH.  I CALLED THE FACTORY AFTER TRYING TO TALK TO THE GENERAL MANAGER OF THE DEALERSHIP, WHO WOULD NOT COOPERATE, AND ASK THEM TO BUY IT BACK.  I WAS OFFERED A NEW ONE BUT REFUSED BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY ARE HAVING TROUBLE WITH ALL OF THEM.  AND I DON'T WANT TO MOVE SOUTH TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.  I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL ON THESE VEHICLES BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY ISSUE.  CURRENTLY, WE ARE IN THE BUY BACK MODE AND HOPE THAT SOMEONE ELSE DOESN'T END UP WITH THIS VAN BECAUSE THE STATE OF WYOMING REFUSES TO BRAND THE TITLE WITH A REMARK THAT IT HAS BEEN A LEMON BUY BACK.  THE TRANSMISSION COOLER LINES ON THE RADIATOR ALSO LEAKED DUE TO COLD WEATHER.  THE TAIL LIGHTS WERE FALLING OFF AND A PART WAS MISSING FROM ASSEMBLY AT THE FACTORY.",
