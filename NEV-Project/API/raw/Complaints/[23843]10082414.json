AFTER TYPING IN \"JEEP CHEROKEE FRONT END VIBRATION\" ON INTERNET SEARCH DID I FIND THAT THIS PROBLEM IS PRESENT IN ALL CHEROKEES.  IT SEEMS THAT THE PROBLEM STEMS FROM THE BRAKE CALIPERS WARPING THE ROTORS EVERY 8-10 THOUSAND MILES.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  THIS VIBRATION MOVES THE STEERING SIDE TO SIDE VIOLENTLY.  *JB",
