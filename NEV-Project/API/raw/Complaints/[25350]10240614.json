USUALLY THIS OCCURS WHEN COMING TO A STOP, BUT NOT ALWAYS.  MAYBE THIS IS THE REASON THE PREVIOUS OWNER SOLD THE CAR.  WE CALLED THE LOCAL DEALER AND WERE TOLD IT WAS A PROBLEM THEY HAVEN'T FOUND A SOLUTION TO YET, AND THE DEALER AT THREE OTHER AZERA OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE DEALER SAID THERE IS A VOLTAGE DROP IN THE CHARGING SYSTEM, AND IT IS MORE NOTICEABLE AT NIGHT WHEN THE HEADLIGHTS ARE ON. I HAVE NOTICED THE VOLTAGE DROP DURING THE DAY ALSO BY SEEING THE SPEEDOMETER LIGHTS DIM. THIS IS SO ANNOYING, AND IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  COULD EVEN BECOME A PROBLEM OF ROAD RAGE IF MY HEADLIGHTS FLASH ON AND OFF AT AN IRATE DRIVER IN FRONT OF ME.   I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE IS NO SOLUTION! *TR",
