FROM MY RESEARCH, DAIMLERCHRYSLER HAS KNOWN ABOUT THE PREMATURE TRANSMISSION FAILURE FOR OVER 15 YEARS BUT HAVE REFUSED TO REMEDY THE SITUATION WHILE CONTINUING TO INSTALL THE SAME TRANSMISSIONS IN ALL DODGE, CHRYSLER AND PLYMOUTH VANS.  IN 1992, CHRYSLER RENAMED THE A604 ULTRADRIVE AS THE 41TE TRANSMISSION TO ESCAPE BAD PUBLICITY!  WHY IS THE GOVERNMENT LETTING THIS CONTINUE?  DO WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SOMEONE GETS KILLED?  *AK",
