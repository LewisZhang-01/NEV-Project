THE BEAM PATTERN IS GREATLY INFERIOR TO WHAT A BIKE OF THIS STYLE SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH. CORNERING ON DARK ROADS AT ANY SPEED ABOVE 30 MPH IS SCARY AND NOTHING SHORT OF TURNING INTO A BLACK HOLE. IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL THIS DESIGN INJURES OR KILLS SOMEONE. TRIUMPH NEEDS TO RECALL THIS HEADLAMP REFLECTOR AND REPLACE IT WITH A SAFE ALTERNATIVE. MANY OTHER MOTORCYCLES OF THIS CLASS DO NOT SUFFER THIS DEFICIT AND IT NEEDS REMEDIED. *TR",
