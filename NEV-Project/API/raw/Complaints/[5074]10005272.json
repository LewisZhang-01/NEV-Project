TURNED OUT TO BE THE AIR BAG COIL - WHICH HAD AN EXPOSED CIRCUIT. NOTICED MANY TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS OF THIS NATURE ABOUT THE CLICKING IN THE STEERING WHEEL. DO NOT KNOW IF AIR BAG WAS INVOLVED WITH THE TECHINICAL SERVICE BULLETINS OR OTHER COMPLAINTS. COULD HAVE BEEN A VERY SERIOUS INCEDENT IF THIS OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE. SO HAPPENS THAT IT OCCURRED WHILE PULLING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE AT A CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP AFTER JUST HAVING THE ABS SYSTEM REPAIRED.",
