HAD VEHICLE DIAGNOSED AND WAS TOLD THAT FUEL WAS LEAKING ON TOP OF THE FUEL TANK. UPON RESEARCH I FOUND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL RECALLS AND MANY COMPLAINTS FOR THIS EXACT PROBLEM,  BUT RECALLS ARE ONLY IN CERTAIN STATES. I'M SORRY CHEVROLET DOESN'T TAKE THE SAFETY OF IT'S CUSTOMERS SERIOUSLY AS I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE DRIVING MY YOUNG CHILDREN IN THIS CAR. CHEVROLET PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW BEING IN A DIFFERENT STATE CHANGES THE FACT THAT YOU MADE A CAR WITH YET ANOTHER DEFECTIVE PART YET YOU WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THE VEHICLES THAT YOU PUT IT IN???  *TR",
