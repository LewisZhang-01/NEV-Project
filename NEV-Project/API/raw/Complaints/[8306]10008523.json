        "summary": "I JUST HAD THE DRIVER SIDE PASSENGER DOOR MALFUNCTION IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE DOOR COULD NOR BE OPENED MANUALLY, WITH THE REMOTE OR WITH THE POWER BUTTON IN THE CAR.  THIS IS AN OBVIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM.  GOOD THING I DID NOT HAVE AN ACCIDENT WHERE THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE VAN WAS DAMAGED OR OBSCURED.  GOD FORBID A FIRE.  AND GUESS WHAT, THE 36000 MILE WARRANTY JUST RAN OUT.  AS DID $500 OF MY MONEY.  ANOTHER PROBLEM IS WITH THE POWER DOORS AND POWER TRUNK (HATCH).  THEY WILL NOT CLOSE PROPERLY.  THESE OPENINGS WILL ATTEMPT TO CLOSE, BUT RIGHT BEFORE THEY COMPLETE THE ACTION, THEY REVERSE TO A FULLY OPEN POSITION.  THE DEALER CANNOT SEEM TO FIX THE PROBLEM, EVEN AFTER MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  THEY HAVE HAD MAY VANS IN THEIR SHOP FOR AT LEAST 12 DAYS N THE PAST TWO YEARS TRYING TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.  I WILL GIVE THE DEALER SOME CREDIT, AFTER THE LAST VISIT I HAVE NOT HAD THIS PROBLEM.  IT ONLY TOOK THE 6-7 VISITS TO GET IT RIGHT.  I WONDER IF MY CURRENT PROBLEM HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS LAST VISIT?   *NLM    *DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*769303. *AK",
