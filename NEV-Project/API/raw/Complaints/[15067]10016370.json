        "summary": "I HAVE NOTICED A SLOW AIR LEAK ON ONE OF MY TIRES INSTALLED ON MY 2001 F150 SUPERCREW.  A LEAK TEST IN A TUBE OF WATER FOUND THE LEAK WAS DUE TO A SMALL HOLE IN THE SIDEWALL APPROXIMATELY 1 INCH FROM THE RIM.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT ALL TIRES HAVE SPORADIC CRACKING AND MINOR BUBBLING ON THE SIDEWALL ON BOTH SIDES OF ALL TIRES.  THE TIRES ARE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO BE DRY-ROTTED.  ALL TIRES ARE GOODYEAR WRANGLER RT/S P255/70R16.  TIRES WERE MANUFACTURED 3/01 WHICH COINCIDES WITH THE MFR DATE OF MY VEHICLE.  THE LOCAL GOODYEAR DEALER WILL PRO-RATE THE COST OF THE REMAINING TREAD TOWARDS THE PURCHASE OF A NEW SET OF TIRES.  FORTUNATELY, I CHECK THE TIRES ON ALL MY VEHICLES AT LEAST WEEKLY AND HAVE PREVENTED A POSSIBLE FATALITY BEFORE IT HAS HAPPENED.  THESE TIRE DEFINITELY APPEAR TO HAVE A SERIOUS MATERIAL DEFECT THAT WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION.               *JB",
