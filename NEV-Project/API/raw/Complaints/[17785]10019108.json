I TOOK MY CAR IN FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE  5/15/03 AND  TOLD THEM ABOUT THE PROBLEM AGAIN.  THEY CALLED ME AND SAID THERE IS A PROBLEM IN THE STEERING. THEY SAID THE STEERING SHAFT COLUMN DID NOT HAVE ANY GREASE LEFT AND  THAT  IT WAS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE.  THE COST WAS $189.00 TO HAVE IT FIXED.  SO I HAD IT FIXED.  THEY SAID IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY.   *NLM",
