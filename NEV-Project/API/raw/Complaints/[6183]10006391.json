THEY DID FIX THIS THEN I REPORTED THAT THE KEYLESS ENTRY REMOTE DID NOT WORK .  I WENT THERE ON THREE OCCASIONS FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 HOURS TOTAL TO HAVE THIS FIXED, THEY DID FIX AND NOW IT DOES NOT WORK AGAIN.  I AM ALSO HEARING A WATER SWISHING SOUND WHEN I START THE CAR AND WHEN DRIVING MOSTLY IN CENTER OF CAR, BUT CAN BE HEARD IN ALL AREA INCLUDING WHEN I STEP ON AND OFF THE BRAKE.  I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND SAW THREE SALES PEOPLE AND THEY COULD NOT HELP ME AND TOLD ME TO COME BACK ON MONDAY.  THEY WERE VERY RUDE AND WOULD NOT EVEN OFFER A SUGGESTION ABOUT THE PROBLEM I WAS HAVING.  THIS IS A BRAND NEW CAR AND COSTING MORE THAN 23,000 DOLLARS, SHOULD I HAVE ALL THESE PROBLEMS ALREADY.     *JB      ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****741071",
