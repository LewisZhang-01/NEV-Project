        "summary": "BRAKES HAVE A FADING BRAKE PEDAL, NISSAN SAYS THIS IS OK/NORMAL. I SAY THIS IS DANGEROUS. THE BRAKES WORK FINE UNLESS YOU ARE IN A PANIC SITUATION. WHEN YOU PRESS ON THE PEDAL  TO MAKE A QUICK STOP IF NECESSARY ON THE HIGHWAY THE PEDAL TRAVELS 4\" TO 5\". YOU LOSE SECONDS IN A \"NEED TO STOP NOW\" SITUATION. NOT ONLY DOES THIS MAKE THE DRIVER TRY TO PUMP THE BRAKES BUT THE TRAVEL IS SO LONG AS TO EXTEND YOUR LEG COMPLETELY AND STILL NEED TO COMPRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL MORE. DIDN'T REALIZE THIS PROBLEM EXISTED UNTIL THE OTHER DAY WHEN I NEEDED TO PANIC STOP. ALMOST LOST CONTROL TRYING TO COMPENSATE FOR THE PEDAL TRAVEL. ALSO WHEN BACKING MY BOAT INTO THE LAKE - CONSTANT PRESSURE MAKES THE PEDAL TRAVEL DOWN. THE BRAKES HOLD BUT I HAVE TO COMPENSATE FOR THIS \"MUSHY\" PEDAL. I HAVE RECENTLY REPLACED THE BRAKES, CALIPERS AND MASTER CYLINDER TO NO AVAIL. I GUESS I COULD REPLACE ALL THE BRAKE COMPONENTS BUT ACCORDING TO MY RESEARCH IT WON'T HELP. AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE NEWER VEHICLES OF NISSAN (NOT JUST TITAN) HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. HOW THEY GET AWAY WITH THIS I DON'T KNOW. ITS A PROBLEM YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT UNLESS YOU'VE DRIVEN THESE VEHICLES AWHILE..I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE HAVING THIS PROBLEM AND BEING \"DEAD ENDED\" BY NISSAN. I'M 63, HAVE WORKED ON CARS MY WHOLE LIFE, I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS AS NO DOUBT MANY HAVE BEEN INJURED OR KILLED BY THIS PROBLEM. I CANT SELL THE VEHICLE TO ANYONE ELSE KNOWING THERE'S NO SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. PS - FORD, CHRYSLER AND CHEVY DO NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM. THE ONLY SOLUTION IT SEEMS IS TO MODIFY/REPLACE THE WHOLE BRAKE SYSTEM -- EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT - WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS. PLEASE HELP.",
