THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE WHEN PRESSING THE PEDAL OR IN REVERSE. THIS HAS CAUSED A SAFETY HAZARD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY WHEN THE CAR SUDDENLY LOST ITS POWER TO MOVE AS IF IT'S IN COMA. TWO MECHANIC SHOPS SAID THE CVT TRANSMISSION SYSTEM NEEDS REPLACEMENT. COSTS 3500$. CANNOT AFFORD IT OF COURSE AND THE CAR ITSELF NOW IS NOT WORTH THIS AMOUNT.",
