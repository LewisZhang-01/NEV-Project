I HAD TO MANUALLY TURN THE WHEEL.  WITH MY TWO CHILDREN IN THE BACK I ALMOST WENT INTO A DITCH.  I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND TOOK IT IN FOR THEM TO LOOK AT.  THEY TOLD ME THAT THE POWER STEERING GEAR ASSEMBLY WAS LEAKING AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  THEY FOUND THAT WHEN THE VES VALVE WAS COMMANDED SHUT, THE VALVE WOULD NOT RE-OPEN.  THE RACK WAS ALSO LEAKING ON THE LEFT SIDE. THEY REPLACED THE GEAR ASSEMBLY, SET TOE AND FLUSHED THE SYSTEM.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN AND SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO FOR A RECALL.  *TR",
