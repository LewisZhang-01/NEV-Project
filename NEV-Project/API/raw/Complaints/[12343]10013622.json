THE DEALER SAID THE TIRES WERE CHOPPY AND HAD UNEVEN WERE.  THEY ALSO STATED IT WAS A KNOW DEFECT.  THEY REPLACED TWO TIRES UNDER WARRANTY.  WELL I NOW HAVE 30000 MILES ON THE CAR AND I AM GOING TO REQUEST MY 5TH, YES FIFTH, SET OF TIRES TO BE REPLACED.  ONLY THIS TIME  AM I GOING TO REQUEST ANY TIRE AS LONG AS IT IS NOT THE FIRESTONE AFFINITY HP P205 65 R15.  THIS IS MY FIRST GM CAR AND I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.  IF GM KNOWS THE TIRES ARE DEFECTIVE, WHY DO THEY CONTINUE TO REPLACE THEM WITH THE SAME DEFECTIVE TIRE?  *JB",
