I HAD SOMEONE ELSE LOOK AT IT, AND WE DISCOVERED THAT THE SUBFRAME THAT HOLDS THE LOWER A-ARM WAS BROKEN, AND THE A-ARM HANGING BY ONLY ONE END.    THE MODELS 350SL-450SL CURRENTLY HAVE A RECALL, AND SO MUST 380SL BECAUSE IT SHARES THE SAME SUBFRAME DEFECT AS THE OTHERS.    NOT ONLY IS THIS A COSTLY REPAIR, BUT IT IS AN DANGEROUS ONE, AS IF THE SAME THING HAPPENED WHILE THE CAR WAS MOVING I WOULD MIGHT HAVE LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED.
