THE BLACK PLASTIC UNDER THE CONTACTS ON THE LARGER LIGHT HOUSING ASSEMBLY HAVE MELTED AND DROPPED AWAY LOWER THAN THE CONTACTS ON THE LIGHT ASSEMBLY SOCKET CAN REACH, THEREFORE CONTINUITY IS BROKEN AND NEITHER LIGHT WILL WORK.  PLASTIC UNDER THE CONTACTS IS NOW DETERIORATING AND CRACKING DUE TO THE HEAT OF THE BULB OR TOO MUCH CURRENT DRAW.  THIS LAMP IS ALSO THE NIGHTTIME RUNNING LAMP SO IT WILL BE ON CONSTANTLY DURING THE EVENING HOURS.    IT CONCERNS ME THAT THE PLASTIC AROUND THIS LAMP IS DEFECTIVE AND CANT TAKE THE HEAT TO THE POINT THAT L/R BRAKE LIGHT SYSTEM FAILS.  OTHER BULBS AND SOCKETS IN USE IN THIS ASSY. DON'T APPEAR TO BE AFFECTED.  IS THERE A FIRE HAZARD?  *TR",
