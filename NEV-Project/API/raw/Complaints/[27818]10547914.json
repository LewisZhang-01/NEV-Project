RESTARTED THE CAR ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON AS WELL AS THE MAINTENANCE LIGHT, AFTER CHECKING FOR CODES 2110 WAS PRESENT, CYLINDER 3 HAD MISFIRED. DROVE THE CAR HOME IT WAS FINE. DROVE THE CAR FOR A WEEK WITH 2 MORE OF THE SAME INCIDENTS (INCREASED ACCELERATION WITH OUT PUSHING THE PEDAL) WHILE DRIVING. ON 10/14/13 WHILE AT A STOP LIGHT THE CAR INCREASED THE THROTTLE ON ITS OWN TO 6K RPMS AND UPON RELEASE OF THE BRAKE MY TIRES BROKE LOOSE AND BEGAN TO SQUEAL AGAIN I WAS ABLE TO CONTROL THE CAR BY SHIFTING IN TO NEUTRAL AND THE RPMS SETTLED AT 600, I SHIFTED BACK INTO DRIVE AND IT HAS BEEN FINE FOR 2 DAYS. AFTER LITTLE RESEARCH IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE (GOOGLE SEARCH) THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE BODY IS MALFUNCTIONING AT RANDOM MILEAGE RANGES AND WITHOUT WARNING IN BOTH THE MERCURY MILAN AND FORD FUSION. I AM HIGHLY CONCERNED THAT A REPLACEMENT PART WOULD NOT EVEN FIX THE VEHICLE. ITS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE AND PEOPLE NEED TO BE WARNED, MIGHT BE LIKE TOYOTA INCIDENT.  *TR",
