        "summary": "MARCH 17TH, 2010: WIFE CALLS ME AT WORK AND SAYS SHE WAS BRINGING MY DAUGHTER HOME FROM SCHOOL AND THE EXPLORER 2002 TRANSMISSION STARTED SLIPPING AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE O/D LIGHT WAS FLASHING.  SHE WAS ABLE TO DRIVE IT HOME UNTIL I COULD LOOK AT IT.  I DROVE IT LATER THAT EVENING AND DETERMINED THAT IT WAS SLIPPING BETWEEN 2ND AND 3RD HEAR AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON.  ON MARCH 19TH...I DROVE TO AUTOPARTS STORE AND HAD THEM READ CODE FROM COMPUTER: P0745.  I DID ALOT OF RESEARCH AND IT APPEARS THAT THE INTERMEDIATE BAND MAY HAVE BROKEN AND TRANSMISSION NEEDS REPAIRED/REPLACED ($1500-$3000???)    I WILL BE CONTACTING FORD ON MONDAY MARCH 22ND, 2010 TO TAKE IT INTO SHOP AND HAVE THEM DETERMINE WHAT THEY THINK IS WRONG.  SEEMS TO BE A VERY COMMON ISSUE...  IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CAR TRANSMISSION SLIPS DURING ACCELERATION AND STARTS TO SLOW POSSIBLY CAUSING SOMEONE TO HIT VEHICLE FROM BEHIND.  SOMETIMES IT KICKS IT IN ABRUPTLY...JERKING DURING THE GEAR SWITCHING...DANGEROUS!!! *TR",
