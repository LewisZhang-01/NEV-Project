THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CHROME WHEELS WAS FINALLY RESOLVED WHEN CHRYSLER REPLACED THE FRONT TWO CHROME WHEELS AT 24,000 MILES BECAUSE THEY WERE BOTH OUT-OF-ROUND SINCE NEW, CREATING THE WOBBLE IN THE STEERING, UNEVEN STEERING, VIBRATION AND TIRE WEAR.  I AM STILL AWAITING REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE TWO NEW PRO-RATED (BY GOODYEAR) EAGLE GT TIRES ON THE FRONT, AS WELL AS AWAITING WORD ABOUT A PROMISE TO REEPLACE THE TWO REAR EAGLE GT TIRES AS WELL. ANYONE WITH THE SAME WHEEL AND/OR TIRE PROBLEMS CAN WRITE TO ME AND I WILL ADVISE YOU AS TO WHAT TO DO....JOHNGUBBIO@AOL.COM",
