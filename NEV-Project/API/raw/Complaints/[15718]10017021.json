AT 12,000-14,000 MILES, THE FRONT BRAKES WOULD VIBRATE AND GRIND VERY BADLY.  THE VSC ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT DUE TO IT WOULD ACTIVATE FOR NO REASON AND I WAS UNABLE TO ACCELERATE INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  THE DEALER NEW ABOUT THE BRAKE PROBLEM AND REPLACED THE FRONT ROTORS AND PADS.  FRONT BRAKES WORKED GREAT AFTER REPLACING THE PARTS.  CURRENTLY I AM AT 30,000 MILES, THE SAME BRAKE PROBLEM AGAIN.  I TOOK THE TRUCK TO A MECHANIC JUST FOR AN INSPECTION AND THE PADS LOOK NEW AND THE ROTORS NOW HAVE GOUGES IN THEM.  THE BRAKES SQUEAL VERY LOUD AND THE METAL GRINDING VIBRATION IS BACK AGAIN.  MY SISTER HAS THE SAME EXACT MODEL AND YEAR, HER BRAKES ARE DOING THE EXACT SAME THING. *JB",
