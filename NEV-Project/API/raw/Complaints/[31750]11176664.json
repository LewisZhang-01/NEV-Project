I FOUND OUT THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO MANY 4TH GENERATION 4RUNNER OWNERS BUT TOYOTA WON'T RECALL OR EXTEND THE WARRANTY FOR THIS ISSUE ANY LONGER. NOW I HAVE TO EITHER NEVER USE MY REAR DEFROSTER AGAIN WHILE LIVING IN COLORADO OR RISK IT SHATTERING AGAIN AND HURTING PASSENGERS IN MY CAR. I WOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT THE VEHICLE IF I HAD KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH A DANGEROUS ISSUE.",
