COOLANT WAS LEAKING OUT AND THERE WERE PIECES OF BLACK PLASTIC ALL OVER THE GROUND. WHEN I LIFTED THE HOOD, I FOUND THAT ONLY HALF MY FAN WAS ATTACHED.  THE OTHER HALF APPARENTLY BROKE OFF AND BLEW THREW MY RADIATOR.  I HAD TO REPLACE THE FAN, MOTOR, RADIATOR, THE FAN SHROUD AND COOLANT.   THE GARAGE SAID THEY HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.  THIS WAS AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR WITH NO WARNING SIGNS.  THE CAR IS PAMPERED AND MAINTAINED WELL.  *JB",
