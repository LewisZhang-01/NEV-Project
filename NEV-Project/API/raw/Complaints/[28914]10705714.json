        "summary": "TOOK MY VEHICLE IN FOR SERVICE TO BRENENGEN CHRYSLER FORD DEALERSHIP LOCATED IN TOMAH, WI. THE SERVICE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PERFORMED WAS A SAFETY RECALL, OIL CHANGE, AND TIRE ROTATION. SAFETY RECALL FOR MY VEHICLE IS THE TRANSAXLE'S INTERNAL PARK ROD FOR 2015 CHRYSLER 200'S, RECALL NOTICE R08/ NHTSA 15V-090 THAT I FOUND ON MOPAROWNERCONNECT.COM.  I LEFT MY VEHICLE AT THE DEALERSHIP AT 8:00AM. I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL AT 8:50AM, SAYING MY VEHICLE IS READY FOR PICK UP. I STATED THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO PICK UP MY VEHICLE UP AT 4:30PM. WHEN I PICKED MY VEHICLE UP I FIND OUT THAT THE SAFETY RECALL FOR MY VEHICLE WAS NOT DONE AND THE OIL LIFE MONITOR WAS NOT RESET. I CHECKED MY OIL TO SEE IF IT WAS CHANGED, IT DID NOT HAVE THE CLEAR BROWNISH COLOR THAT I WOULD EXPECT AFTER AN OIL CHANGE. THE OIL WAS NOT DARK BUT AGAIN NOT CLEAR, ESPECIALLY FOR A VEHICLE THAT HAS LESS THAN 6000 MILES.  I WAS TOLD TO LEAVE MY VEHICLE FOR 30 MINUTES AND THEY WOULD DO THE RECALL. I CAME BACK AFTER AN HOUR AND WAS TOLD THEY COULD NOT PERFORM THE SAFETY RECALL BECAUSE IT WAS A 2 HOUR JOB. I MADE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT FOR THE FOLLOWING WEEK FOR THE SAFETY RECALL.  I DROPPED MY VEHICLE OFF THE NIGHT BEFORE MY APPOINTMENT WITH SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT 5:00PM. I RECEIVED A VOICE MESSAGE THE NEXT DAY AT 2:30PM SAYING MY CAR IS READY FOR PICK UP. I ARRIVE AT 4:45PM TO PICK UP MY VEHICLE; AGAIN THE SAFETY RECALL WAS NOT PERFORMED. THE REASON THIS TIME IS THAT \"CHRYSLER SENT THE WRONG PARTS FOR THE SAFETY RECALL.\" IRONICALLY ENOUGH, WHEN I GET HOME, I FIND A SAFETY RECALL NOTICE IN THE MAIL. THE NOTICE SAYS THAT THE SAFETY RECALL WILL TAKE 8 HOURS AND TO MAKE THE APPOINTMENT AFTER MAY 1.   I UNDERSTAND THAT THINGS HAPPEN, I BEEN THERE, ON THE DEALERSHIP SIDE AND IN EVERY DAY LIFE. WHAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IS WHY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT COULD NOT AT LEAST DO SOME RESEARCH ON THE SAFETY RECALL.  *TR",
