TOOK IT TO THE DEALER, THEY DID NOT FIND ANYTHING, SO I PICKED UP THAT SAME AFTERNOON, NEXT MORNING SAME PROBLEM. I TOOK THE CAR BACK ON JAN 19, LEFT IT OVER NIGHT AND THEY FOUND IT TOOK A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO GO INTO GEAR, THEREFORE, THEY DECIDED TO LOOK AT THE TRANSMISSION, THE CAR HAS BEEN AT THE DEALER SINCE 1/20 THRU 2/7, AFTER SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS THEY HAVE TOLD ME IT IS THE HEATING CORE DRIPPING ON TOP OF THE COMPUTER DAMAGING THE SENSORS, TODAY 2/8 THE CAR WOULD NOT GO INTO GEAR AT ALL.  I HAVE HAD GREASE WITH THE SEAT BELTS, THEY HAD TO BE CHANGED AT 3600 MILES, THE TIRES (EAGLE) HAD TO BE REPLACED AT 18,000MIES, THE BRAKES STARTING ACTING UP AT 6000 MILES, THE STEERING STARTED VIBRATING AT 12,000 MILES.  BOTTOM LINE THIS CAR IS A MESS, SUCKS AND MITSUBISHI DOES NOT WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF THOSE PROBLEMS, THIS IS A BIG LEMON!*AK",
