        "summary": "MY VEHICLE HAS BEEN REGULARLY SERVICED AND MAINTAINED AS SUGGESTED BY ACURA.  HOWEVER, I AM CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING GREAT DIFFICULTY WITH MY 2001 ACURA CL TYPE S BECAUSE THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM IS MALFUNCTIONING.  THE TRANSMISSION WILL ABRUPTLY SHIFT INTO HIGHER GEARS WHILE THE VEHICLE IS TRAVELING AT LOW SPEEDS.  THE CAR HAS LOST POWER WHEN ASCENDING STEEP HILLS AND PRESENTS GREAT DANGER TO OTHER VEHICLES BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO PULL-OVER OR STOP.  ALTHOUGH ACURA WARRANTY COVERS THIS PROBLEM AND APPLIES TO VEHICLES IN THE US VIRGIN ISLANDS, THEY HAVE NOT EXPEDITIOUSLY DEALT WITH THE PROBLEM.  ALREADY, AFTER ONE MONTH, ACURA HAS NOT SENT THE NECESSARY PARTS TO THE DEALER OR MADE ACCOMODATIONS SO THAT I WOULD NOT BE DRIVING AN UNSAFE VEHICLE.  AFTER NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO INFORM ACURA AND THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT, I HAVE RECEIVED VERY LITTLE ASSISTANCE.  I HOPE THIS COMPLAINT WILL HELP BUILD THE RECORD SHOWING THAT ACURA IS MANUFACTURING A FAULTY, UNSAFE PRODUCT AND IS FAILING TO ADEQUATELY REMEDY THE PROBLEM.",
