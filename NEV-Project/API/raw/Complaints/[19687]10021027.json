ON 6/4/03, AT 9:48 A.M., I CONTACTED BRALEY & GRAHAM PONTIAC, IN MY HOMETOWN OF SACRAMENTO, CA, AT 916-481-2200 AND SPOKE TO BRIAN AT EXT. 4248.  BRIAN CHECKED MY VIN AND TOLD ME, \"THERE IS NO RECALL OR OPEN CAMPAIGN ON YOUR CAR\".  I THEN CONTACTED PONTIAC AT 800-762-2737 AND SPOKE TO SEAN ARMSTRONG, (GM REQUEST NO. 1-105820909) WHO, AT FIRST, COULD FIND NO RECALL AT ALL.  WHEN I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD THE NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER AND THEN THE GM RECALL NO (02049), HE PUT ME ON HOLD THEN CAME BACK AND SAID THAT HE HAD, IN FACT FOUND THE RECALL, BUT IT DID NOT INCLUDE MY VIN.  I EXPLAINED THAT MY PROBLEM WAS EXACTLY THE PROBLEM LISTED AND HE SAID IT WAS NOT COVERED.  HE SUGGESTED I TAKE THE CAR INTO A DEALER AND HAVE THEM CHECK IT, (AT MY OWN EXPENSE), AND POSSIBLY IT COULD BE USED TO EXTEND THE RANGE OF VINS COVERED.  I REQUESTED THAT GM PROVIDE A FREE INSPECTION TO DETERMINE THE FACT, RATHER THAN TAKING IT IN AT MY EXPENSE (AND AT MY PERIL, AS I HAVE ALREADY HAD AN EXPERIENCE WITH THE LOCAL DEALER THAT CONVINCES ME THAT THEY ARE NOT COMPLETELY HONEST !).  HE SAID THAT WAS NOT POSSIBLE.  I THEN TRIED TO CALL NHTSA AUTO SAFETY HOTLINE AT 888-327-4236 TO REQUEST FURTHER ASSISTANCE IN GETTING THIS SAFETY ISSUE RESOLVED.  I GOT A RECORDED MESSAGE THAT \"DUE TO AN UNEXPECTED EMERGENCY...(THEY WERE NOT AVAILABLE TO ANSWER MY CALL)\"  I LEFT A RATHER FRUSTRATED MESSAGE WITH MY PHONE NUMBER AND NAME, AND THEN IMMEDIATELY TURNED ON MY T.V. TO SEE WHAT UNEXPECTED EMERGENCY HAD SHUT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DOWN.  I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THE INDICTMENT OF MARTHA STEWART MAY BE OF INTEREST TO MANY, BUT (SINCE IT IS THE ONLY LEAD NEWS STORY I CAN FIND) I HAVE DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING HOW THAT COULD BE THE SOURCE OF SHUTTING DOWN THE NHTSA SAFETY HOTLINE.   *NLM",
