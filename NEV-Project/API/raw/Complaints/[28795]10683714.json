IF THIS HAD HAPPENED A FEW MINUTES LATER WOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE AT APPROXIMATELY 65 MPH. THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT MOVE WHEN PUSHED, SO MOST LIKELY AT THAT SPEED IT WOULD HAVE FLIPPED OVER CARRYING A MOTHER AND CHILD.  JEEP HAD RECALLS FOR THIS PROBLEM THROUGH 2005. THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS ON THIS EXACT ISSUE ON THE 2007. JEEP REFUSED TO ASSIST IN ANY WAY.  THE MANAGER STATED THAT IT WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY.   PARTS NEEDED FOR REPAIR: CONTROL ARM, BALL JOINT AND WHEEL WHICH WAS CRACKED WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. 1231.00.  JEEP NEEDS TO STEP UP AND COVER/REIMBURSE FOR SAFETY ISSUES THAT ARE KNOWN ISSUES ON THEIR VEHICLES. NO GOOD FAITH FOR SAFETY FROM JEEP. RECALL THESE PARTS BEFORE PEOPLE GET KILLED.  *TR",
