PROBLEM DIAGNOSED AS DEFECTIVE SENSOR WIRING HARNESS.  COMPUTER DOWNLOAD REPAIR INFORMATION INDICATES THAT THE PROBLEM WAS DETECTED IN SEPTEMBER, 1990 WITH AN INFORMATION BULLETIN CIRCULATED BY CHRYSLER CONCERNING THE ISSUE.  MY QUESTION IS WHY THIS WASN'T MADE SUBJECT TO RECALL SINCE IT INVOLVES A SAFETY MATTER.  WITHOUT A SPEEDOMETER OPERATING, THERE IS NO WAY OF KNOWING ONE'S EXACT SPEED?  I HAVE TRIED TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM BY REPLACING THE WIRING HARNESS WHICH, IT APPEARS, IS UNAVAILABLE.  I JUST SENT AN E-MAIL TO DAIMLER-CHRYSLER ASKING FOR THEIR HELP SINCE I HAVE NO OTHER WAY TO TURN EXCEPT FOR YOU, DOT.  I WOULD AT LEAST LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU.     THANK YOU.",
