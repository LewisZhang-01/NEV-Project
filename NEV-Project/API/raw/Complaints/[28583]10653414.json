THIS MORNING WHILE COMPLETELY STOPPED IN THE DRIVE THRU OF THE BANK AT THE WINDOW, REACHING INTO THE OPEN DRAWER FOR A DEPOSIT SLIP, MY BMW ACCELERATED WIDE OPEN ON ITS OWN. I DISTINCTLY LOOKED DOWN AND MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE. THE CAR WAS MOVING EXTREMELY FAST AND THE ENGINE WAS REVVING AS IF THE GAS WAS PRESSED EVEN THOUGH MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE. THE DRIVE THRU OPENED UP INTO A LONG PARKING LOT. I WAS ABLE TO PULL UP THE PARKING BRAKE TO STOP THE CAR. IT WAS SO SCARY AND I WAS AT THE POINT TO MAKE A DECISION TO GET INTO TRAFFIC, IF I COULD MAKE THE TURN OR TO HIT A RETIREMENT BUILDING. ONCE THE CAR STOPPED, I PUT IT IN PARK AND TURNED IT OFF. I CHECKED TO ENSURE THERE WAS NOT ANYTHING ON THE GAS PEDAL AND THERE WAS NOT. THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE AND I AM SO THANKFUL TO GOD, HE ALLOWED ME TO STOP THIS CAR. THIS HAS TO BE SOME TYPE OF DEFECT.   *TR",
