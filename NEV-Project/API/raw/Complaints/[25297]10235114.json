ONE ON THE FRONT, WHICH WAS COVERED UNDER RECALL AND BOTH BACK SPRINGS.  FRONT SPRING WAS COVERED IN RECALL, BUT FROM WHAT I'VE FOUND ONLINE JUST AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE REAR SPRINGS.      CHARGED OVER $600 IN REPAIR TO GET 2 NEW REAR SPRINGS INSTALLED, BUT STILL HAVE RATTLING PROBLEMS AFTERWARDS.     CAR IS DRIVEN EXTREMELY LIGHTLY AND THE FINAL BREAKAGE HAPPENED WHILE BACKING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY AT APX 5MPH. *TR",
