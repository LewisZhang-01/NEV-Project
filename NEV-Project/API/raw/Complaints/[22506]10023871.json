VISITED DEALER 3 TIMES TO FIX A WINDSHIELD WASHER LEAK INTO TAILGATE, FILLING LIGHT FIXTURES AND SEEPING INTO REAR OF CAR.  I HAVE HAD MY FAN MOTOR REPLACED AND MY REAR DOOR LATCHES ARE NOT WORKING CORRECTLY.  ALL OF MANY RECALLS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED, WE EVEN RECEIVED 4 NEW TIRES DUE TO TREAD WEARING.  IT TOOK MANY TRIALS TO GET A CORRECT ALIGNMENT.  MY STEREO OFTEN WILL CUT OUT FOR NO REASON.  I AM NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY AND FEAR THAT THIS MOST RECENT SUSPENSION REPAIR WILL BE COSTLY WHILE I STILL MAKE MONTHLY PAYMENTS ON MY VEHICLE.  CAN YOU HELP?  *JB",
