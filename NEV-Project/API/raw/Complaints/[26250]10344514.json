        "summary": "HELLO, WE HAVE A 2003 MERCURY GRAND MARQUIS THAT HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE HEAD LIGHTS SHUTTING OFF AT RANDOM TIMES. NOTHING GAVE WARNING TO THIS PROBLEM HAPPENING, WE BOUGHT THE CAR USED, AND WAS JUST FINE FOR A YEAR, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN ONE DAY THE HEADLIGHTS JUST GO OUT. THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED WAS ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO(3-1-10). NOW EVERYTIME IT IS DRIVEN WITH THE HEADLIGHTS ON, IT IS GUARANTEED TO HAPPEN AT LEAST ONCE AND SOMETIMES UP TO 5 TIMES JUST IN 3 MILES OF DRIVING ON MY WIFE'S WAY HOME FROM WORK. THE ONLY WAY TO GET THE LIGHTS BACK ON AFTER THEY GO OUT IS TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, SHUT THE CAR OFF, LET SIT FOR A FEW MIN, THEN START AND THEY WORK AGAIN FOR A BIT. THIS IS OVERALL VERY DANGEROUS AND SURPRISING THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT OR RECEIVED A TICKET YET!     I AM A ACTIVE MEMBER ON A CROWN VICTORIA FORUM, AND WITH LITTLE SEARCHING ON THAT SITE OR GOOGLE YOU WILL SEE TONS OF REPORTS OF THIS BEING A VERY COMMON PROBLEM ON THE 2003-2005 CROWN VICTORIA, GRAND MARQUIS, AND MERCURY MARAUDER. WITH THE HELP OF OTHER MEMBERS ON THAT FORUM IT WAS FOUND TO BE A FAULTY LCM(LIGHTING CONTROL MODULE) WHICH HAS A PROBLEM WITH OVERHEATING LIGHTING RELAYS. THE ONLY WAY TO REMEDY THIS PROBLEM IS TO PURCHASE A NEW LCM FOR ANYWHERE BETWEEN $250 AND $600 WITH NO GUARANTEE HOW LONG THAT PART WILL LAST. I ACTUALLY PURCHASED A NEW ONE TODAY. VERY EXPENSIVE FIX JUST FOR THE USE OF HEADLIGHTS, BUT I VALUE MY FAMILIES SAFETY MORE. I WILL BE KEEPING MY OLD LCM TO POSSIBLY HAVE IT REPAIRED FOR WHEN MY NEW PART FAILS AGAIN. THANKS SO MUCH. *TR",
