        "summary": "THE PARKING BRAKE IS A MECHANICALLY OPERATED DRUM AND SHOE BRAKE INDEPENDENT OF THE HYDRAULIC CALIPER.  THE DESIGN IS DEFECTIVE IN THAT THE SHOE ASSEMBLY IS HELD IN PLACE ONLY BY FRICTION OF THE ACTUATOR SURFACE AND A CLIP.  UNDER VIBRATION, THE SHOE FALLS AND RIDES ON THE DRUM WEARING IN TO THE DRUM.  ON MY VEHICLE, THE TOP OF THE SHOE BRAKE SURFACE WAS NOT WORN BUT THE BOTTOM WAS DOWN TO THE METAL AND THE DRUM HAD WORN 0.100 INTO THE RADIUS.  AS A RESULT, THERE WAS NO PARKING BRAKE.  THE LOCAL CHEVROLET DEALER SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT GM WAS WORKING FOR A FIX IN THE 2003 MODELS AND THAT THEY REPLACED MANY DRUMS AND SHOE ASSEMBLIES AT AN ESTIMATED COST TO THE OWNER (OR NEW VEHICLE WARRANTY) OF $1000.  DISCUSSION WITH A LOCAL TX STATED INSPECTION STATION INDICATED THAT THEY REJECT MANY 2000 AND NEWER GM VEHICLES DUE TO PARKING BRAKE FAILURES.   *JB      ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****762856",
