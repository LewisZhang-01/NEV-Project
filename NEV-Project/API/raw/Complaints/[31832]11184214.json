WILL TURN ON. WHEN THE CAR COMES TO A STOP, THE OIL LIGHT ALSO TURNS ON AND THE ENGINE SHUTS OFF, ESSENTIALLY PUTTING THE CAR IN NEUTRAL. THE DASH INSTRUCTS TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK. THE CAR STARTS AGAIN AFTER PUSHING THE IGNITION TO TURN OFF THE CAR AND TURNING IT BACK ON AGAIN, BUT WILL HAVE THE SAME THING HAPPEN THE NEXT TIME THE BRAKES ARE PRESSED AND THE CAR SLOWS DOWN. IT HAS TURNED OFF TWICE WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION, GOING SLOWLY. AFTER THREE FIRST INSTANCES OF THIS PROBLEM, THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER WHERE THEY FOUND A \"FATAL ERROR OF THE ECM\" AND THE MAIN COMPUTER IN THE CAR WAS CHANGED AND THE GROUNDS WERE TESTED. THE SECOND INSTANCE OF THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED ON THE SAME DAY THE VEHICLE WAS PICKED UP FROM REPAIRS. THE CAR HAD ~200 MILES WHEN THE PROBLEM FIRST OCCURRED AND HAS LESS THAN 250 CURRENTLY. IN SUMMARY, THE CAR HAS TURNED OFF, MAKING IT UNABLE TO ACCELERATE, WHILE IN TRAFFIC ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. THERE WERE ISSUES WITH APPLE CARPLAY GLITCHING JUST BEFORE EACH INSTANCE OCCURRED. THE INSTANCES WERE EXACTLY ONE WEEK APART.",
