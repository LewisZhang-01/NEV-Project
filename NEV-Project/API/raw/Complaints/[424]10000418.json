        "summary": "I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS PROBLEMS OUT OF MY TRANSMISSION ON MY 1997 MAZDA 626 V4 AUTOMATIC. I HAVE TAKEN MY CAR TO A TRANSMISSION MECHANIC SHOP 3 TIMES NOW AND ONE OF THE TIMES IT HAD TO BE TOWED, AND THEY CANNOT FIND WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. THE OVERDRIVE LIGHT WOULD COME ON AND CONSTANTLY FLASH AND THE CAR WOULD START SHIFTING HARD AND SOMETIMES WOULD NOT WANT TO SHIFT INTO PASSING GEAR AT ALL. BUT ONCE IT SETS FOR A FEW HOURS AND COOLS DOWN, THE OVERDRIVE LIGHT DOESN'T COME ON ANYMORE AND THE MECHANIC SHOP TELLS ME THAT THE CAR HAS RESET IT'S SELF AND THEY CANNOT DETECT THE DEFECT CODE BY THEIR COMPUTER DIAGNOSTICS. IT SEEMS LIKE THE OVERDRIVE LIGHT ONLY COMES ON WHEN YOU HAVE HAD THE CAR ON THE ROAD FOR A WHILE, AND IT GETS HEATED UP. I HAVE READ SEVERAL OTHER TRANSMISSION COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER MAZDA 626 OWNERS OFF THE INTERNET AND IN MY LOCAL RESIDENCE AREA. I'AM REQUESTING THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING DONE ABOUT THESE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS BY MAZDA. MAZDA NEEDS TO HAVE A RECALL ON THE MAZDA 626 V4 CARS, BY REQUESTING PEOPLE TO GO TO THEIR LOCAL MAZDA DEALERSHIP AND HAVE THEIR CAR CHECKED FOR THESE TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS. AND IF A PROBLEM IS DETECTED ON THE TRANSMISSION BY THE MAZDA SERVICE DEPARTMENT, THEN MAZDA SHOULD BE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CHARGES. I WOULD LIKE FOR MAZDA TO CONTACT ME ABOUT MY COMPLAINT.  THANK YOU.",
