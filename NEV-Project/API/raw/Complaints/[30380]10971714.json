THANKFULLY WE WERE ABLE TO GET OFF THE ROAD AS IT WAS ON CA 99 , A PRETTY BUSY ROAD.  AFTER A RESTART IT SEEMED FINE, UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN WE WERE DRIVING HOME TO SOUTH LAKE TAHOE.  THE TRANSMISSION WENT INTO LIMP MODE AND WOULD NOT GO OVER 3000RPM, PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS AS WE WERE DRIVING UP A MOUNTAIN ROAD AT NIGHT .  SINCE THEN WE HAVE DRIVEN IT VERY LITTLE, BUT IT JOLTS REGULARLY WHILE DRIVING.  THIS IS THE SECOND TIME WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SUCH SYMPTOMS AND THE SECOND TRANSMISSION IN THIS VEHICLE.  THE ORIGINAL TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED AT 69273 MILES, VEHICLE NOW HAS129000.",
