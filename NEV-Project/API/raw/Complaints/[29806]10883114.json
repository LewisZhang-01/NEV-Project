        "summary": "2014 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE WAS IN PARK, I SHIFTED IT INTO DRIVE, THE VEHICLE MOVED ABOUT 1 FOOT, AND JERKED ITSELF BACK INTO PARK.  I TRIED EVERY OTHER GEAR AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED.  AFTER ABOUT 15 MINUTES I TRIED IT AGAIN AND IT WORKED FINE.  WHEN THE TOW COMPANY CAME TO PICK IT UP, IT STARTED JERKING ITSELF BACK INTO THE PARK POSITION AGAIN, FROM EVERY GEAR ACCORDING TO THE TOW COMPANY, A FLAT BED TRAILER WAS USED TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE A REGULAR TOW TRUCK COULD NOT MOVE IT.  DEALERSHIP HAS INDICATED TO ME THAT THEY HAVE FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT (JULY 6, 2016), FOR ME TO GO PICK IT UP.  I DID NOTIFY THE MANUFACTURER, AND I AWAIT A RESPONSE.  ALL OF THIS OCCURRED AFTER THE S27 UPDATE WAS PERFORMED ON THE VEHICLE.  VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION EVEN MORE SO THAN THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY TRIED TO FIX.  MILEAGE 32333.  THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY IN A FLAT LEVELED PARKING LOT.",
