DURING THE TURN THE POWER STEERING LOCKED UP AND THE BREAKS DID NOT WORK, THE DASH LIGHTS CAME ON AND I FINALLY FIGURED OUT THAT THE ENGINE HAD STALLED.  I COASTED DOWN THE DOWNHILL SLOPE AND FINALLY RESTARTED THE ESCAPE AFTER PUTTING IT IN NEUTRAL.  LUCKILY, THERE WAS LIGHT TRAFFIC BUT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN VERY DANGEROUS.  WHEN I CALLED MARSHALL FORD EAST IN CLEVELAND, OHIO THEY SAID THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS PROBLEM AND SINCE IT HAD NOT HAPPENED AGAIN IT WAS NOT FURTHER INVESTIGATED.",
