ROTORS AND PADS HAVE BEEN REPLACED 4 TIMES WITH THE CALIPERS REPLACED THE LAST TIME PER TSB #0500302 DTD 5/02.  THEY HAVE NOW FAILED AGAIN EVEN WITH THE NEW CALIPERS.  THE DEALER HAS BEEN GREAT, HOWEVER THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW WITH CHRYSLER/JEEP THAT NEEDS A RECALL AND A PERMANENT FIX.  IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE AS WELL AS A TIME ISSUE TO HAVE IT FIXED EVERY 8,000 MILES!  CHRYSLER REFUSES TO PROVIDE AN EXTEDNED WARRANTY OR ANY LASTING SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. I THINK A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT WOULD BE IN ORDER.",
