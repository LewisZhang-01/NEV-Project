THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY ACCELERATED FORWARD AT HIGH SPEED THROUGH THE YARD FENCE, SHE IMMEDIATELY HIT THE BRAKE, HOWEVER THE CAR CONTINUED TO TRAVEL AN  ADDITIONAL 34 FEET AND FINALLY CAME TO STOP AFTER HITTING A LARGE CHERRY TREE.   GRASS AND DRIVEWAY MARKINGS VALIDATE HER ATTEMPT TO BRAKE THE VEHICLE AND THE FACT THAT THE ACCELERATION CONTINUED EVEN AFTER BRAKING. AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. INJURIES TO MY WIFE APPEAR TO BE MINIMAL, HOWEVER, THERE WAS EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE JEEP CHEROKEE AND $1400 IN PROPERTY DAMAGE.  *NLM",
