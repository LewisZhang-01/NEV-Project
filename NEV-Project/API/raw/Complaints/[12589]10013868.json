THE FIX IS REPLACING THE REGULATOR, AT A VERY HIGH COST. THIS PROBLEM SHOULD BE PERMANENTLY FIXED, AS IT IS A HAZARD TO BE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY IN A STORM AT 65 MILES AN HOUR, AND HAVE ALL THE WINDOWS START OPENING. THIS WILL GO ON, EVERY MINUTE OR SO. SHOULD BE FIXED, PRIOR TO PEOPLE GETTING INTO ACCIDENTS.   *NLM",
