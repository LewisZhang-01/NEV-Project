SINCE WE LIVE IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA AND EXPERIENCE WINTERY WEATHER WE HAVE FOUND THAT THESE TIRES ARE VERY DANGEROUS ON WINTER ROADS.  WE ARE SURE THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS UNLESS DIFFERENT TIRES HAVE BEEN PURCHASED THAT PERFORM BETTER IN THESE CONDITIONS.  WE HAVE NEVER OWNED A VEHICLE THAT THE FIRST THING WE HAD TO DO WAS PURCHASE NEW TIRES IN ORDER TO DRIVE IN WINTER WEATHER.  THE ADDED EXPENSE IN TOTALLY RIDICULOUS CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE CAR!  WE EXPRESSED OUR CONCERN TO THE DEALERSHIP TO NO AVAIL....I AM SURPRISED THERE IS NOT A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT REGARDING THIS MATTER.  UNFORTUNATELY, THIS WILL BE OUR LAST PURCHASE OF AN ELANTRA.",
