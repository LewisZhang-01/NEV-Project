        "summary": "IT STARTED BACK IN APRIL. MY CAR WOULDN'T GO INTO REVERSE. IT STARTED FLASHING THE R ON THE DASH THEN NEXT TO THE GEAR SHIFT. I TOOK IT INTO THE SHOP. IT THEN STARTED NOT GOING INTO REVERSE OR DRIVE. NOT ONLY WOULD THE LIGHTS FLASH AT ME BUT IT WOULD SAY PLACE VEHICLE INTO NEUTRAL THEN DRIVE OR REVERSE. IT ENDED UP TOWED ONCE BECAUSE T WOULDN'T GO ANYWHERE. THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT POPPED UP. IT SAID ALL MY GEARS WERE NOT FOUND. IT HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE SHOP 7 TIMES FOR THIS SAME REASON. IT WON'T REVERSE AND/OR WON'T GO INTO DRIVE. THE GEAR SHIFT ALSO POPPED INTO PARK GOING DOWN THE INTERSTATE. MOST RECENTLY I HAD A COLLISION WHERE IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE IN REVERSE AND ENDED UP GOING FORWARD AND HITTING A PARKED VEHICLE. MY VEHICLE IS STILL NOT FIXED AND I OWE MONEY ON IT. MY BRAKES HAVEN'T BEEN WORKING CORRECTLY AND I KNOW THEY ARE STILL GOOD BECAUSE MY MECHANIC DAD AND BOYFRIEND HAVE CHECKED THEM. THE CRUISE WILL GO OFF RANDOMLY AND THE TOUCH SCREEN GOES WHITE, BLACK AND BACK ON. THERE IS AN OPEN RECALL WITH NO REMEDY. I DO NOT FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE CAUSE. ALSO, I AM HAVING PROBLEMS GETTING THE IGNITION TO RELEASE MY KEY. DODGE HIRED AN INVESTIGATOR. IT TOOK MY CAR BEING HIT BEFORE THEY DECIDED TO TAKE ACTION. I FEEL LIKE I'M DRIVING A DEATH TRAP THAT I CAN'T GET OUT OF AND USUALLY HAVE ONE TO 3 KIDS IN MY CAR. I'D RATHER NOT HAVE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT BECAUSE THIS CAR IS A PIECE OF (XXX).",
