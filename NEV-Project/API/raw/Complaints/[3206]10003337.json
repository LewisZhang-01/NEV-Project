        "summary": "MY FAMILY OWENS 2 DODGE AVENGERS A 1995 AND A 1998, THE PROBLEM IS THE HEAD LIGHTS THEY ARE DISCOLORING FROM THE INSIDE AND DODGE HAS NOT PROVIDED ANY WAY TO STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING ITS A DEFECT IN THE PLASTIC HEADLITE COVER. THIS SITUATION CAUSES A HAZZARD WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT. I TALKED TO DODGE ABOUT IT AND THE DEALER SUGGESTED I PURCHASE NEW HEADLIGHT COVERS FOR A TOTAL OF $386.00 EACH AND THEY ADMIT THE NEW COVERS WILL DISCOLOR AFTER A PROLONGED OUTSIDE EXPOSURE. I PERSONALLY THINK THIS IS AN ATTEMP TO GOUGE THE PUBLIC AND I AM HOPING YOU ALL CAN HELP. I WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY $50.00 TO 100.00 FOR A SET OF NEW HEAD LIGHTS BUT OVER $700.00 IS WAY OUT OF LINE.  THANK YOU",
