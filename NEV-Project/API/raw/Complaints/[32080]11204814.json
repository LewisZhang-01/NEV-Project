        "summary": "ON THE NIGHT OF MARCH 2, 2019 I WAS DRIVING AT ABOUT 50 MPH ON A STATE HIGHWAY WHEN I SUDDENLY, WITHOUT WARNING, LOST PROPULSION.  A NOTE CAME ON ON THE DASH INDICATING THAT I NEEDED TO PULL OVER AND PUT THE CAR INTO PARK.  HAPPILY THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC SO THAT I WAS ABLE TO DO SO WITHOUT AN ACCIDENT.  I WAS UNABLE TO RESTART THE CAR AND PUT IT INTO DRIVE AFTER THAT, SO I CALLED A TOW TRUCK.  IT WAS VERY COLD WAITING FOR THE TOW TRUCK AS THE CAR HAD NO HEAT.  THE CAR REPORTED APPROXIMATELY 50% BATTERY CAPACITY THE ENTIRE TIME.  A SUDDEN UNEXPECTED LOSS OF PROPULSION IS A DANGEROUS EVENT.  THE CAR HAD ONLY 11,000 MILES ON IT.  AFTER SITTING FOR SOME TIME, THE CAR HAS 'FIXED' ITSELF.  HOWEVER, THIS WILL PROBABLY HAPPEN AGAIN.  I HAVE BROUGHT IT TO A CERTIFIED CHEVROLET SERVICE CENTER AND CALLED CHEVROLET TO REPORT THE ISSUE.  BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT, THEY ARE UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.",
