I HAVE HAD MY HUSBAND DISASSEMBLE THE CAR SEAT MANY TIMES TO FIX THEM ESPECIALLY AFTER I TRIED TO TIGHTEN THE STRAPS AND AS I WAS PULLING AS HARD AS I COULD, MY HAND ACCIDENTALLY SLIPPED AND WHACKED MY POOR 1 1/2 YR OLD IN THE FACE...... THIS SITUATION SHOULD BE RECTIFIED BEFORE A CHILD IS HURT THE STRAPS ARE TWISTED AND CUT INTO THEIR SKIN AND CAN SLIP OFF THEIR SHOULDER IN AN ACCIDENT.  I WILL NEVER BUY COSCO AGAIN.  THEY DO NOT MAKE A QUALITY PRODUCT AND EDDIE BAUER IS AN IDIOT FOR ENDORSING THEIR SEAT.*JB",
