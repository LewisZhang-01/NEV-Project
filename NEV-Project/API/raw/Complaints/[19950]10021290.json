        "summary": "THREE TIMES IN FIVE DAYS, MY 2000 HYUNDAI WAS IN THE SHOP - TWO OF THESE TIMES IT HAD TO BE TOWED WHILE I WAITED ALONE ON THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY.  FIRST I WAS TOLD THAT THE THERMOSTAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND THAT THE CAR WAS OKAY.  I TOOK IT BACK THE DAY FOLLOWING AND EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS NOT IDLING CORRECTLY.  I RECEIVED IT BACK THE FOLLOWING DAY AND WITHIN 10 MILES OF DRIVING WAS HAVING SURGES IN THE ENGINE AND THE RPM'S WOULD RACE INTO THE RED.  I PULLED OVER AND THE DEALER TOLD ME TO SLOWLY DRIVE THE CAR BACK.  I TRIED, BUT NEVER MADE IT.  THE CLOSER I GOT, THE WORSE THE CAR BUCKED AND THE RPM'S RACED.  I FINALLY TOOK MY FOOT OFF OF THE BRAKE AS I DECIDED WHETHER TO CONTINUE ON OR PULL OVER, BUT BEFORE I COULD DECIDE, MY CAR BEGAN ACCELERATING ON IT'S OWN.  I QUICKLY GOT THE CAR OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE EXPRESSWAY AND INTO THE GRASS.  THE RPM'S STILL ERRATIC AND THE CAR IDLED AT 2.5-3 RPM'S.  THIS CAR IS A DEATH TRAP AND IS NOT SAFE.  DEALERSHIP STILL CAN NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT.*AK",
