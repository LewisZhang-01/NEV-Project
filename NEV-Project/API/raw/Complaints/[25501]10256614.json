        "summary": "MY 2002 MPV SUFFERED A COMPLETE TRANSMISSION FAILURE AT ABOUT 75K MILES, STALLING OUT IN MORNING TRAFFIC AND NEEDING TO BE PUSHED FROM THE ROAD.  THE TRANSMISSION OCCASIONALLY KICKED WHEN SHIFTING SINCE THE CAR WAS NEW.  I CALLED MAZDA, WHICH REFUSED TO PAY ANYTHING TOWARD THE REPAIR, SAYING IT HAD RELINQUISHED LIABILITY FOR A VEHICLE SEVERAL YEARS PAST WARRANTY.  DESPITE WHAT I SEE IN NHTSA'S COMPLAINT LOG AND ELSEWHERE ON THE NET, MAZDA TOLD ME THAT IT DOES NOT AGREE THAT THE TRANSMISSION ON THE 2002 MPV IS UNUSUALLY PRONE TO FAILURE.  IN THE PAST SEVEN MONTHS, THIS MPV HAS NEEDED SEVERAL OTHER EXPENSIVE ENGINE REPAIRS, SOME OF WHICH ALSO REPEATEDLY SHOW UP ON THE NHTSA COMPLAINT LOG:  3 IGNITION COILS, A PCV HOSE, AN IDLE CONTROL VALVE, AND AN OXYGEN SENSOR.  THIS IS QUITE A STRING OF EXPENSIVE FAILURES FOR A CAR LESS THAN 7 YEARS OLD.  THE DEALER OFFERED TO DO THE TRANSMISSION WORK FOR $3600, ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE I WILL HAVE IT DONE ELSEWHERE FOR SOMEWHAT LESS.  I STRONGLY URGE NHTSA TO REEVALUATE WHETHER A RECALL IS MERITED FOR THE 2002 MPV'S DEFECTIVE TRANSMISSION. *TR  THE CONSUMER STATED HE HAD TO HAVE 3 IGNITION COILS, A PCV HOSE, AND IDLE CONTROL VALVE NAS A RIGHT UPPER OXYGEN SENSOR. UPDATED  02/12/09. *JB",
