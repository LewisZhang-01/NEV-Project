I DID EXPERIENCE SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS SIMILAR TO THE BRAKE PROBLEM NOW BEING INVESTIGATED - A MOMENTARY LOSS OF BRAKE POWER WHILE GOING OVER A POTHOLED/BUMPY PATCH OF ROAD.  IT WAS JUST FOR A MOMENT AND NO ACCIDENT RESULTED, BUT I AM WORRIED NOW THAT THE PROBLEM MIGHT NOT HAVE JUST BEEN A RANDOM FLUKE.  SEPARATELY, I HAD ANOTHER STRANGE INCIDENT WITH THE CAR.  BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE, I HAD NOT YET HIT THE ACCELERATOR BUT THE CAR IMMEDIATELY JUMPED BACKWARDS AS THOUGH I HAD HIT THE GAS HARD.  THE ONLY WAY PREVENT IT FROM BUCKING BACKWARDS WAS TO HIT THE BRAKE.  I HAD TO SORT OF JOLT OUT OF THE PARKING SPACE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO IN BETWEEN OF NORMAL/SLOW ACCELERATION.  ONCE I GOT OUT OF THE SPACE AND PUT THE CAR INTO DRIVE, IT WAS ACCELERATED NORMALLY. *TR",
