I AM VERY VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS CAR (50 YRS OLD) AND HAVE NEVER ABUSED IT BUT THE WHEELS SEEM TO BOTTOM OUT OR DEFLATE EASILY AND DENT THE RIMS UNDER CONDITIONS THAT WOULD NEVER AFFECT ANOTHER CAR OTHER THAN THIS ONE.  I FEEL UNSAFE DRIVING THE CAR NOW WITH THE DAMAGED RIMS.  NOT SURE WHETHER THE WARRANTY WILL COVER THE RIM REPLACEMENT.  *NLM",
