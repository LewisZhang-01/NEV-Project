        "summary": "ON 9/26/2017 AT 3:55 P.M. I WAS INVOLVED IN A SINGLE CAR ROLLOVER ACCIDENT. I WAS TRAVELING ON HWY 97 IN CALIFORNIA AT APPROXIMATELY 55-60 MPH. NO MORE THAN 10 MILES OUTSIDE THE CITY OF WEED. I HIT SOMETHING IN THE ROAD OR BLEW A TIRE. THE CAR FIRST WENT LEFT AND THEN RIGHT. THE BREAKS FELT AS THOUGH THEY LOCKED. WHEN THE CAR HIT AN ASPHALT CURB IT WENT AIRBORNE (THERE WERE NO GUARD RAILS) AND WENT INTO A SMALL EMBANKMENT. THE VEHICLE ROLLED BUT LANDED UPRIGHT. NONE OF THE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED. I ALSO BELIEVE THE SEATBELT DID NOT LOCK AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO WHEN A CRASH OCCURS. I SAY THAT BECAUSE THE RIGHT SIDE MY HEAD HIT THE ROOF OF THE VEHICLE AND I RECEIVED A LARGE HEMATOMA. INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE  THE ROOF HAD CAVED IN. WHEN I SAW THE VEHICLE THE NEXT DAY IT WAS THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ROOF THAT HAD CAVED IN. WHAT ALSO MAKES ME BELIEVE THERE IS A SEATBELT ISSUE IS I WAS INVOLVED IN A ROLLOVER IN 1985 AND DID NOT SUFFER ANY HEAD INJURIES AS THE SEAT BELT KEPT ME TIGHTLY IN THE SEAT.",
