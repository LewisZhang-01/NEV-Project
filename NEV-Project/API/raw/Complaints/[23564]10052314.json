WHEN I TRIED GETTING THE STEERING WHEEL TO MOVE AGAIN, IT WOULDNT BUDGE RIGHT BUT WHEN TRYING LEFT IT WOULD MAKE A \"HISSING\" SOUND, LIKE AIR PRESSURE BEING RELEASED. THIS HAPPENED AT 10PM AND I HAD PASSENGERS IN THE VEHICLE, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC. THIS HAPPENED SUDDENLY WITH NO WARNING WHATSOEVER. I AM GOING BACK TO THE DEALER ASAP.*AK",
