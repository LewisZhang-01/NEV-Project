IT STARTED WITH THE CHECK ENGINE SOON LIKE COMING ON AND GIVING A CODE THAT I WAS RUNNING THE CAR WITH THE FUEL CAP OFF. AFTER THE THIRD TIME THEY REALIZED IT IS AN ERROR. THEN THE DOORS STARTED LOCKING THEIRSELVES. I HAVE HAD 3 STEREOS INSTALLED, ALL HAVING ELECTRONIC PROBLEMS AND NOW MY AIRBAG LIGHT KEEPS COMING ON RANDOMLY AND NOT GIVING A CODE WHEN HOOKED UP TO READ IT. NO ONE CAN GIVE ME A STRAIGHT ANSWER. I HAVE BEEN INTO THE DEALER SO MANY TIMES.  I HAVE NOW HAD THE CAR 2 1/2 YEARS. THE WARRANTY WILL BE OFF SOON AND THEY STILL CANNOT FIX OR EVEN EXPLAIN MY PROBLEMS.  TS",
