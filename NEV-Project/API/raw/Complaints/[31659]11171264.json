        "summary": "I GOT OUT OF MY JOB ON A SATURDAY AND ONCE I GOT TO MY 2012 FORD FUSION AND TURNED IT ON, MY DASHBOARD DISPLAY A MESSAGE SAYING \"SERVICE POWER STEERING NOW\". THE STEERING WAS SO STIFF TO THE POINT THAT IT'S TOO DANGEROUS TO DRIVE IT OUT ON THE STREETS. I THEN GOT ON MY PHONE TO SEE IF THERE'S A QUICK FIX TO IT AND ENDED UP FINDING OUT THAT MY CAR HAS A RECALL FOR THE POWER STEERING. SO I CALLED MY MOM TO COME PICK ME UP AND LEAVE THE CAR AT MY JOB'S PARKING LOT. ONCE I GOT HOME I CALLED MY FORD DEALER TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THIS RECALL, BUT THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS CLOSED. SO I WAITED TILL MONDAY TO CALL THEM, ONCE I CALLED THEM I ENDED UP FINDING OUT THAT MY CAR HAS ANOTHER RECALL RELATING TO THE PASSENGER'S AIRBAG. SO I HAD A TOW TRUCK TAKE MY CAR TO NEAREST FORD DEALER SO THEY CAN RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. I TALKED TO A REPRESENTATIVE AND HE TOLD ME SINCE MY CAR HAD BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT (PAST OWNER HAD THE ACCIDENT) THAT THEY MIGHT NOT SERVICE THE POWER STEERING BUT THEY WILL FIX THE AIRBAGS FOR SURE. SO I LEFT MY CAR AT THE DEALER. LATER ON THE DAY, HE CALLS ME SAYING THAT CARS OVER 150K ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR THE POWER STEERING SERVICE BUT THAT THEY WILL RESOLVE THE AIRBAG PROBLEM.    TO ME IT SEEMS UNFAIR FOR THEM NOT TO RESOLVE THE POWER STEERING PROBLEM BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANY RECALL FOR MY CAR AND THAT THIS A FACTORY DEFECT. IT'S UNSAFE TO DRIVE A CAR WHEN IT STILL HAS A FACTORY PROBLEM AND CAN HAPPEN ANYTIME, EVEN WHEN I'M DRIVING.",
