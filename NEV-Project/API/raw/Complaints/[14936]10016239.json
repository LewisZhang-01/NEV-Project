        "summary": "THIS 2000 MONACO, DIPLOMAT MOTOR HOME HAS BEEN INHALING EXHAUST, ROAD DIRTY ETC. MAINLY THROUGH THE REAR CAP AREA, SINCE THE UNIT WAS NEW. THE FIRST SIGN WAS AN OILY STAIN IN THE CEILING AREA MOSTLY AROUND CABINETS. FOR APPROXIMATELY FIVE MONTHS THE FACTORY TOLD ME THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND UNTIL I FORCED THE ISSUE IN THE FALL OF 2001, I DID NOT GET THE ANSWER. THE UNIT HAD NOT BEEN SEALED AT THE FACTORY. IT WAS SEALED IN 2001 THOUGH NEVER TESTED, THE PROBLEM CONTINUES AS OF TODAY!  THE UNIT HAD AN ENVIRONMENTAL TEST IN OCTOBER 2001 WITH THE REPORT ISSUED JANUARY 2002 (ENCLOSED) AFTER MONTHS OF TRYING TO SEAL THE UNIT IT STILL LEAKS. IT HAS CAUSED SICKNESS AND ALSO POSSES A HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK AS THE FUMES ARE ALSO ENTERING THE DRIVERS COMPARTMENT. IT WAS INDICATED BY A SENIOR MANAGEMENT OFFICIAL THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN ON GOING SINCE THE EARLY 1990'S.  MONACO, THE MANUFACTURER HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED IT'S ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO FIX THE UNIT, HAS NOT OFFERED TO REPLACE IT AND WILL NOT DO A RECALL ON ALL THESE UNITS AS I HAVE REQUESTED OF THE CEO. *JB",
