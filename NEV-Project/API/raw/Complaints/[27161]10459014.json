WE HAD TO HOLD IT ON AND DRIVE THE CAR BACK HOME. THE CAR HAS NOT BEEN DRIVEN SINCE THAT DATE IN 2010. FORD NEEDS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 2004 MODEL AND ALL OF ITS DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS. THIS IS THE SECOND COMPLAINT THAT I HAVE FILED AGAINST FORD CONCERNING THIS CAR. THE FIRST WAS A #2 VALVE FALLING IN THE ENGINE AND CAUSING THE ENGINE TO BLOW UP. NHTSA PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT FORD. SOMEONE HAS TO MAKE CAR MANUFACTURERS RESPONSIBLE TO THE CONSUMER. EVERY TIME THAT NHTSA IS CONTACTED NOTHING IS DONE UNTIL MILLIONS ARE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.  *TR",
