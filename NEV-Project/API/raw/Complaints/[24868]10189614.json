        "summary": "I DRIVE A 2002 HONDA CIVIC EX. AROUND 50,000 MILES MY SRS LIGHT CAME ON. I FIRST WENT TO THE DEALER ON 10/6/06 WHERE THEY DID A SCAN ON MY CAR AND WAS TOLD IT WAS A UNIT FAILURE AND I WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE MY SRS UNIT ($530.09). I WAS UNABLE TO AFFORD THE REPAIR, SO I HAD TO TAKE THE RISK AND DRIVE AROUND (AVERAGE 60 MILES A DAY FOR COMMUTE) WITH NO AIR BAGS TO SAVE MY LIFE IN AN ACCIDENT. I WAS TOLD TO CALL THE AMERICAN HONDA COMPANY TO SEE IF THEY WOULD COVER THE COST. THEY TOLD ME AIRBAGS ARE NOT AN IMPORTANT SAFETY FEATURE, THEY ARE MORE OF A BONUS. THEY SAID IF IT WAS MY SEAT BELT THEY WOULD HELP ME, BUT THEY DO NOT FEEL AIR BAGS ARE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO FIX. THEY ALSO SAID THEY DON'T REALLY SAVE LIVES. SOON AFTER MY DRIVER SIDE SEAT BELT WAS NOT CLICKING IN PLACE, AND I AGAIN TOOK MY CAR TO HONDA ON 2/16/07. THEY THOUGHT THAT MIGHT FIX MY SRS LIGHT ALSO. BUT IT REMAINED ON AFTER THEY REPLACED MY DRIVERS SIDE SEAT BELT. AGAIN, THEY DID A SCAN AND SAID I NEED TO REPLACE MY SRS SYSTEM.  I AM VERY FRUSTRATED AT THE LACK OF CONCERN HONDA HAS FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS. THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN SAVING LIVES....ONLY SAVING MONEY!! *TR",
