THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT SHAVER MOTORS HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FIX IT.  THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS CAR'S ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.  I WAS DRIVING IN CHICAGO ON 80 90 TOLL ROAD AND THIS VEHICLE STOPPED FOR NO REASON WHILE I WAS DOING 55 MILES PER HOUR.  I LISTED ONE INCIDENT DATE BUT HAVE HAD NUMEROUS OTHER PROBLEMS.  ALSO, WHEN I FIRST PURCHASED THE VEHICLE I HAD TO REPLACE THE TIRES AFTER LESS THAN 3000 MILES, THEY WERE ALSO BAD.",
