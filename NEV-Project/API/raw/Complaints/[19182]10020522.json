        "summary": "MY WIFE WAS DRIVING OUR 2000 F350 FORD TRUCK. IT WAS EQUIPPED WITH FIRESTONE STEELTEX TIRES ON THE REAR.  AT A SPEED OF 55-60 MPH ON I17 IN ARIZONA MY WIFE EXPERIENCED A CATASTROPHIC TIRE FAILURE ON THE LEFT REAR TIRE.  THERE WAS NO WARNING, THE TIRE SIMPLY SEEMED TO COME APART. SHE MANAGED TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE AND BRING IT SAFELY TO A STOP ON THE EDGE OF THE HIGHWAY.  SHE STATED THAT THERE WAS NO DEBRIS IN THE ROAD.  IT WAS APPROX. 12:30 PM, THE TEMPERATURE WAS IN THE 90'S, AND THE ROAD WAS DRY.  AFTER ROAD SERVICE CHANGED THE TIRE SHE CONTINUED ON TO FLAGSTAFF, AZ AND DROPPED THE RIM AND DESTROYED TIRE OFF AT A DISCOUNT TIRE FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE TIRE.  THE SERVICE WRITER STATED THAT  WAS THE WORSE FAILURE HE HAD SEEN ON A TIRE.  THE TIRES WERE OEM.  THEY HAD BEEN INSPECTED THE WEEK BEFORE BY THE LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP AS PART OF ROUTINE SERVICE THE SAME WEEK AS THE INCIDENT.   THE DISTRUCTION OF THE TIRE RESULTED BODY DAMAGE TO THE LEFT FENDER AREA OF THE VEHICLE.  I REQUESTED AND HAVE THE DESTROYED TIRE.  I AGREE IN OVER 20 YEARS OF MILITARY SERVICE I HAVE NEVER SEEN TIRE THAT FAILED IN THIS MANNER.  *NLM",
