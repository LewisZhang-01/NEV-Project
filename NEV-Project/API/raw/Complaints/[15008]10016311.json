GOT OUT OF VEHICLE AND NOTICED THERE WAS THE SOUND OF AN ELECTRIC MOTOR RUNNING EVEN AFTER THE IGNITION WAS TURNED OFF. UNDER THE TRUCK I DISCONNECTED THE ABS MODULE WIRING HARNESS.  TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE DEALER AND WAS ADVISED TO JUST PULL THE 60 AMP FUSE AND LIVE WITH THE PROBLEM.  FOUND OUT THAT IT IS OVER $1,000 TO HAVE FIXED. DEALER INDICATED THERE WERE NUMEROUS FAILURES BUT CHEVROLET WON'T AUTHORIZE REPAIR WHEN OUT OF WARRANTY.  THIS IS THE LAST GM PRODUCT I WILL OWN.    *NLM",
