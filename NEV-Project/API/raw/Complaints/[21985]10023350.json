I TALKED TO THE MAN FOR A MINUTE OR SO AND HE TOLD ME THAT MY TRUCK WAS BEGINNING TO ROLL.  IN MY ATTEMPT TO STOP THE TRUCK THAT WAS ROLLING BACKWARDS TOWARD A BUSY STREET, I FELL AND THE FRONT TIRE ON THE PICKUP RAN OVER BOTH OF MY LEGS.  THE TRUCK HAD SLIPPED FROM PARK INTO REVERSE.  THIS RESULTED IN A BROKEN FIBULA IN MY LEFT LEG WITH DEEP CUTS ON MY LEFT ANKLE.  THE RIGHT LEG WAS SEVERELY CUT ALL THE WAY TO THE BONE AND REQUIRED 32 STITCHES AND MY RIGHT ANKLE WAS ALSO DEEPLY CUT.  AFTER RUNNING ME OVER THE PICKUP THEN HIT A CAR.  I WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR A TOTAL OF 19 DAYS.  I AM STILL EXPERIENCING SEVERE PROBLEMS WITH BOTH OF MY LEGS.  MY TRUCK THEN RAN INTO A CAR.   *NLM",
