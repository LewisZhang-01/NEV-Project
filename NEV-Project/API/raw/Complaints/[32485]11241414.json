WE CONTINUE TRAVELING AT SLOWER SPEED (60 MPH) AND SLOWLY INCREASING IT AND AGAIN AT 70 MPH AND STEPPING ON A LITTLE BUMP THE SHAKE STARTED AGAIN. I SET UP AN APPOINTMENT FOR THE DEALER TO FIND OUT IF THE ISSUE WAS RELATED WITH THE BREAK JOB THEY DID. THEY MENTIONED TO ME ABOUT A SIMILAR ISSUE THAT THIS KIND OF TRUCKS ARE BEEN REPORTING. DEFINITELY, THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE &#9888;&#65039; IF THIS ISSUE IS BEEN HAPPENING MORE AND MORE, DEFINITELY THERE IS A FAULT IN THE TRUCK SUSPENSION.",
