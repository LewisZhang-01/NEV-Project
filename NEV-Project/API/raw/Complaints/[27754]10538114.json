HAVING IT TOWED TO THE CLOSEST MINI DEALERSHIP AT 70 MILES AWAY, THEY ARE SAYING THE FAILURE IS DUE TO ABUSE AND IS NOT COVERED BY MINI USA WARRANTEE. I HAVE BEEN DRIVER FOR OVER 40 YEARS WITH MOST OF MY CARS BEING MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS AND HAVE NEVER HAD TO REPLACE A CLUTCH. AFTER SOME RESEARCH ONLINE, THE CLUTCH SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE WITH THE 2011 & 2012 COUNTRYMAN MODELS AND NOW HAVE SAID...'AS PART OF THE CONTINUAL REFINEMENT AND OPTIMIZATION OF MINI VEHICLES' THEY WERE MODIFYING THE CLUTCH ON THEIR 2013 MODELS! I AM STILL IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH MINI USA ON WHO WILL PAY FOR THE REPAIRS ON WHAT I SEE AS DEFECTIVE PARTS THAT SHOULD HAVE A RECALL ON THEM.",
