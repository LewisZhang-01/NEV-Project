BOTH VOLKSWAGEN CORPORATION AND OUR LOCAL VW DEALER, SPEEDCRAFT IN WAKEFIELD RI, ADMITTED THAT THEY HAVE  A COIL PROBLEM WITH ALL 2002 JETTAS AND PASSATS.  THEY FURTHER NOTED TO MY WIFE THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH PARTS ON HAND TO PERFORM AN ACTUAL RECALL.  WE ARE DEMANDING THAT THEY REPLACE ALL 4 COILS SINCE THEY KNOW THAT IT IS LIKELY THAT ALL 4 WILL EVENTUALLY FAIL.  THEY ARE REFUSING TO DO THIS.  WE FEEL IT IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR THEM TO REFUSE FIXING A PROBLEM THEY KNOW WILL LIKELY OCCUR.  SUCH A FAILURE AT THE WRONG TIME WHILE DRIVING COULD POSSIBLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.  WE ARE FEARING FOR OUR SAFETY.",
