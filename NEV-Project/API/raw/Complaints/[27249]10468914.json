THIS FIRST OCCURRED BACK IN 2009 AND WAS TOLD BY 2 HYUNDAI DEALERS THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 2006-2009 AZERAS.  IN READING SEVERAL HYUNDAI AZERA FORUMS (EDMUNDS, HYUNDAI-FORUMS, ETC), IT IS VERY CLEAR TO ME THAT THIS IS INDEED A VERY COMMON PROBLEM.  AS THE VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AT THAT TIME, MY NEAREST DEALER OFFERED TO REPAIR IT FOR $2000.00+.  HOWEVER, AS I FEEL IF THE PROBLEM IS SO COMMON, THAN PERHAPS A NHTSA INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED WITH THE HOPEFUL EXPECTATION THAT HYUNDAI WILL ISSUE A RECALL AND/OR COVER THE COSTS TO REPAIR.  I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG WILL NOT DEPLOY CORRECTLY IF AND WHEN NEEDED.  PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM.  *TR",
