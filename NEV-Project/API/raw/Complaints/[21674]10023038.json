ABOUT A YEAR AND HALF AGO, IN ONE RAINY MORNING I DROVE MY CAR TO WORK, JUST A FEW MINUTES DRIVING ON THE ROAD AT APPROXIMATELY 50 MPH, THE ENGINE QUIT WORKING...   I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE GARAGE AND FINALLY TOOK IT TO THE CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP TO GET IT CHECKED, AND WAS TOLD I HAVE A INTAKE GASKET PROBLEM, IT COST ME MORE THAN $300 TO GET IT FIXED. HOWEVER, SIMILAR PROBLEM STILL COMES AND GOES MYSTERIOUSLY AFTER THAT. THE MOST RECENT OCCURRENCE WAS ABOUT 2 MONTH AGO. I KEEP TAKING TO THE AUTO SHOP BUT NO ONE CAN TELL ME WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE CAR.  IT IS A 3.5 ENGINE AND I AM NOT THE ORIGINAL OWNER, MAYBE THE PREVIOUS OWNER HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  *NLM",
