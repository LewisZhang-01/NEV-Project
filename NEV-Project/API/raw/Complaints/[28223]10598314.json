        "summary": "I WAS DROPPING MY SON OFF AT DAYCARE. I ATTEMPTED TURN LEFT AND MY BATTERY, BRAKE, AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. MY STEERING ALSO WENT OUT. I TURNED OFF THE CAR AND TURNED BACK IT ON. CAR WAS FINE UNTIL I TRIED TO TURN, SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND WALKED MY SON THE REST OF THE WAY TO DAYCARE. WHEN I RETURNED I STARTED THE CAR AND HEARD A LOUD SCREECHING SOUND. I DROVE IT LESS THAN A MILE BACK HOME AND OPENED THE HOOD TO SEE WHERE THE SOUND WAS COMING FROM. NONE OF MY BELTS WERE MOVING AND CHECKED MY LIQUIDS AND TOPPED EVERYTHING OFF. STILL NOTHING THEN I NOTICED THE PULLEY WAS WOBBLING. WHILE REMOVING THE RADIATOR FAN TO GET A CLOSER LOOK I REALIZED THE PLASTIC NIPPLE THAT CONNECTS TO THE HOSE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY DISINTEGRATED AND BROKEN OFF. I BOUGHT A NEW RADIATOR AND TIGHTENED THE PULLEY BUT THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTED. NOW I'VE LEARNED THE THE CRANK PULLEY BOLT HAS BROKEN AND IS GOING TO COST ME 2000 SOME ODD DOLLARS TO FIX. AFTER READING THE KIA FORUM I SEE THAT HE RADIATOR AND BOLT IS MORE THAN A COMMON ISSUE FOR THE KIA. I'M ON PROBATION PERIOD AT MY JOB AND WILL MOST LIKELY LOSE MY JOB AND MY VEHICLE. I HOPE ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED THIS ISSUE AND THERE IS SOMETHING BEING DONE TO RESOLVE IT.   *JS",
