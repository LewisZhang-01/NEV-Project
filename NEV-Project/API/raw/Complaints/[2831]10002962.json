THE FIRST TIME THE CAR WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.  HOWEVER, THE SECOND TIME THE CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  WHEN I ASKED THE DEALER IF THERE WERE ANY RECALLS FOR THIS ITEM, I WAS TOLD NO AND THAT IT WOULD BE A VERY EXPENSIVE ITEM TO REPLACE.  I DON'T FEEL THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO REMIT ANY MONIES FOR THE REPLACEMENT.  IT'S OBVIOUSLY DEFECTIVE AND SHOULD BE CORRECTED THROUGH THE EXPENSE OF THE MANUFACTURER.",
