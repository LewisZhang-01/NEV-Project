I HAVE 72,000 MILES ON THE CAR AND I HAVE ALREADY REPLACED THE TIRES 4 TIMES THE FIRST SET (ORIGINALS) AFTER ONLY 12,000 MILES I HAVE HAD IT ALIGNMENTS FRONT AND BACK TWICE. I CONTINUE TO HAVE TIRE WEAR AND THE CAR IS ALL OVER THE ROAD AFTER HITTING 55MPH I SHOULD BE ON MY SECOND SET OF TIRES THERE IS ALSO NO SHOCK ABSORBANT ON THIS CAR EVEN GOING SLOW YOU JUST HIT HARD REGUARDLESS. I CAN NOT KEEP THE ALIGNMENT RIGHT OR THE TIRES FROM WEARING QUICK.  THE PAINT IS ALREADY PEELING AND FADING WITH RUST COMING UP IN SOME SPOTS I HAVE A SIX YEAR PAINT PROTECTION BUT THE DEARLER SAYS ITS MY FAULT THE WAY I WASHED IT OR ROCKS IN THE ROAD ALOT OF EXCUSES. MY # 1 COMPLAINT WITH TOYOTA THOUGH HAS BEEN BURNING OIL I CAN NOT KEEP OIL IN THE ENGINE I AM REPLACING A QUART TOO TWO QUARTS A WEEK I HAVE REGUARLY SERVICED THE CAR AND AFTER A OIL CHANGE AND ABOUT 400 MILES I AM BONE DRY OF OIL MY CAR HAS DEVELOPED A KNOCK FROM THIS WHEN I CALLED TOYOTA DUE TO MY SERVICE MANS ADVICE THEY SAID WELL SOME CARS ARE RECALLED WITH THIS (BURNING OIL)BUT NOT YOURS AND GAVE ME A CASE NUMBER. THERE ARE NO LEAKS I PARK THE SAME PLACE EACH DAY, NOTHING ON THE ENGINE THE OIL IS JUST BURNING UP AND FROM WHAT MY SERVICE GUY SAYS THERE ARE \"SEVERAL\" DOING THIS AND HE TOLD ALL TO CALL TOYOTA BUT TOYOTA DOES NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT OR RECALL ANYMORE ENGINES FOR THIS PROBLEM, ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE ADMITED SEVERAL OF THEIR MODELS BURN OIL AND HAVE BEEN RECALLED. I BOUGHT THE CAR NEW WITH 5 MILES ON IT, IN MY OPINON THIS CAR SHOULD NOT BE BURNING OIL AFTER 2 YEARS NOT TO THE POINT YOU HAVE NO OIL IN YOUR ENGINE 2 WEEKS AFTER AN OIL CHANGE. THE CAR IS 3 1/2 YEARS OLD NOW BUT THIS PROBLEM STARTED WHEN THE CAR HAD ABOUT 40,000 MILES ON IT. I WOULD SIMPLY JUST LIKE TO STOP CHANGING TIRES SO OFTEN, KEEP AN ALIGNMENT  (WHICH OF COURSE MY WARRANTY ON TIRES IS VOID SINCE THE PROBLEM IS ALIGNMENT WEAR) AND STOP PUTTING SO MUCH OIL IN MY ENGINE, OR HAVE IT BLOW UP SOON.",
