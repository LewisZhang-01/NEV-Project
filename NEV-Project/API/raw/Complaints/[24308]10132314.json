SAID IT'S EASIER TO REPLACE THEN FIND THE PROBLEM AT DEALERSHIP.   HAVE DONE OIL CONSUMPTION TESTS 1 LITRE OF OIL PER 3161KM. SAYING THAT THIS NORMAL. THIS DEALERSHIP HAVE RECOMMENDED FLUSHING THE ENGINE. CHANGING THE GRADE OF OIL. DO NOT DRIVE IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC. MOST OF THE CONSUMPTION OCCURS ON THE HIGHWAY AND NOT IN TRAFFIC. CHANGE THE OIL INSTEAD OF 8000 KM AT 5000KM??? THIS IS WHAT VOLKSWAGEN HAS RECOMMENDED. THE MOST INTERESTING PART WAS WATCHING THE MECHANIC WHEN IT CONSUMED THE MOST AMOUNT BETWEEN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST. HE STARTED LOOKING FOR LEAKS AGAIN & ADDED OIL. RATTLING IN DRIVER SIDE DOOR AND WINDOW FELL INTO DOOR PASSENGER SIDE. FIXED WINDOW AND RATTLING STILL SEEMS TO BE NOTICABLE. *JB",
