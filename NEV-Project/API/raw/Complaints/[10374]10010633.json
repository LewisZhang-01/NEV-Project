        "summary": "I OWN A '99 FORD EXPEDITION-BOTH OF THE SIDE MIRRORS HAVE DETERIORATED TO THE POINT I CAN BARELY SEE OUT OF THEM DURING THE DAYTIME, AND ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE OUT OF THEM AT NIGHT.  I WENT BACK TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP AND WAS INFORMED THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT MIRRORS DETERIORATING AND TO REPLACE BOTH WILL BE 498.00 A PIECE PLUS TAXES.  I HAVE EXTENDED COVERAGE, WHICH STATE THEY WON'T PAY FOR REPLACEMENT ,DUE TO MIRRORS BEING CONSIDERED GLASS.  SERVICE DEPT AT THE FORD DEALERSHIP SAID THAT MIRRORS ARE NOT GLASS AND THAT IT'S ACTUALLY REFLEXOR PAPER OR SOMETHING.  I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD LOOK INTO MATTER.  I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH AND HAVE FOUND THE DETERIORATION OF SIDE MIRRORS ON FORD EXPEDITIONS TO BE A WELL DOCUMENTED SERVICE PROBLEM UNDER THE WEBSITE OF RECALLS. THIS IS MY 2ND TIME TRYING TO GET FORD TO WORK WITH ME ON THIS MATTER.  *JB",
