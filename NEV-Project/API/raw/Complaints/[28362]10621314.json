        "summary": "THE TRANSMISSION ON THIS VEHICLE IS FAULTY AND THE VEHICLE STALLS OUT AT LOW GEARS. WHEN YOU STOP AT A STOP SIGN OR STOP LIGHT, TURN THE STEERING WHEEL ON ACCELERATION, OR BACK THE VEHICLE IT STALLS OUT AND THEN THE VEHICLE JERKS/ SHAKES TO GET BACK INTO GEAR. IT IS TERRIBLY DANGEROUS. FORD HAS NOW ATTEMPTED TO FIX THE ISSUE ON MY VEHICLE 3 TIMES AND HAS FAILED TO DO SO. MY VEHICLE HAS HAD THE TRANSMISSION RE-SEALED AND ON A SEPARATE OCCASION THEY HAVE TAKEN MY TRANSMISSION APART TO REPLACE THE CLUTCH AT JUST OVER 6500 MILES. MY VEHICLE IS IN THE SHOP FOR THE 3 TIME, RETURNING WITH THE ISSUES THAT WERE ALLEGEDLY \"REPAIRED\". THE VEHICLE WILL NOT GO ON ACCELERATION, OFTEN TIMES - IN TRAFFIC - I HAVE BEEN ALMOST RAN OVER OR REAR ENDED BY OTHER VEHICLES. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DIE FIRST, BEFORE THIS ISSUE IS TAKEN CARE OF. I BOUGHT WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A NICE, NEW, RELIABLE AND SAFE VEHICLE.. IT HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A LEMON THAT CAN VERY WELL END UP COSTING MY LIFE. MANY CONSUMERS HAVE THIS VERY POPULAR VEHICLE, FORD IS NOT ALERTING ANYONE TO THE PROBLEMS THEY ARE SELLING THESE VEHICLES WITH. THE VEHICLE STALLS OUT GOING DOWN THE ROAD.. AND TO AN UNSUSPECTING DRIVER FOLLOWING BEHIND ME, I COULD END UP REAR ENDED AND SERIOUSLY HURT OR KILLED. THE REVIEWS FROM OTHER FORD FOCUS DRIVERS MAKE IT OBVIOUS THAT FORD HAS TRIED AND FAILED OVER AND AGAIN TO FIX THIS TRANSMISSION PROBLEM. SOME REVIEWS MENTION HOW THE TRANSMISSION HAVE CAUSED THEM ACCIDENTS, WHEN THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY JERKED INTO GEAR CAUSING THE DRIVER TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT THIS. HOW CAN FORD CORPORATE GET AWAY WITH THIS?   *TR",
