WARRANTY EXPIRED AT 60,000 - TRANSMISSION FAILED AT 67,000.  SHARDS OF METAL PRESENT IN DRIP PAN.  VEHICLE WAS WELL-MAINTAINED AND SERVICED AT TOYOTA DEALER AT SPECIFIED SERVICE INTERVALS.  I AM JUST LUCKY IT DID NOT FREEZE UP WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY LIKE SO MANY OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED.  THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH TRANSMISSIONS IN 2000 SIENNAS AS IS EVIDENCED BY ALL THE COMMENTS AND COMPLAINTS ON VARIOUS INTERNET SITES.  DEALER AND MANUFACTURER REP DID GET THE PRICE DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY; HOWEVER, I FEEL THE MANUFACTURER HAS A DEFECT AND SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL OR RE-IMBURSE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM.",
