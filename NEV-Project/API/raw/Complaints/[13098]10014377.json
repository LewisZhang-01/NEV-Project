AT ISSUE FOR SAFETY IS WHETHER OR NOT THE DESIGN OF THE ROTORS AND DRUMS ARE ACCEPTABLE FOR THE ADDITIONAL WEIGHT OF THE QUAD-CAB LINE.  THE WEAR ON MY VEHICLE IS UNUSUALLY FAST AS I HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE FOR ONLY 7 MONTHS AND DRIVE MOSTLY HIGHWAY MILES. THE BRAKE PADS (LININGS) ARE STILL IN GOOD SHAPE SO, IN MY OPINION, THE COMPOSITION AND DESIGN OF THE ROTORS AND DRUMS ON MY VEHICLE ARE NOT SAFE.  IF THIS ISSUE IS NOT ADDRESSED THERE WILL BE THE POSSIBILITY FOR NUMEROUS BRAKE FAILURES ON THIS MODEL IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.  THE PARTS SHOULD BE RECALLED AND THE ROTORS AND DRUMS SHOULD BE REDESIGNED.   *NLM",
