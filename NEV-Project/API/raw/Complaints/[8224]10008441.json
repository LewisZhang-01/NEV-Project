        "summary": "I OWN A 1995 MERCURY VILLAGER.  THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE SEAT BELT BECAME UN-OPERATIONAL IN MARCH 2001.  I CONTACTED MY DEALER AND MERCURY AT THE TIME, NEITHER WAS OF ANY HELP AND SHOWED NO CONCERN.  I PAID  $121 OUT OF POCKET TO REPLACE THE PART.  NOW, IN FEBRUARY OF 2003 THE SAME LOCATIONS SEAT BELT IS UN-OPERATIONAL AGAIN.  I CONTACTED MY DEALER WHO TOLD ME TO CALL MERCURY.  THEY WILL NOT HELP COVER A PART THAT IS MORE THAN 12 MONTHS OLD.  WE WERE TOLD OVER AND OVER THAT IT'S THEIR POLICY.  I HAVE OWNED ABOUT 6 VEHICLES IN MY YEARS OF DRIVING, THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE.  A DEFECTIVE SEAT BELT SHOULD BE AT THE BOTTOM OF MY LIST OF CONCERNS REGARDING MY AUTOMOBILES.  THE SEAT BELT ON THIS PASSENGER SEAT IS USED THE LEAST IN THE VAN BECAUSE I REQUIRE MY CHILD TO SIT IN THE MIDDLE ROW OF MY VAN AND 90% OF THE TIME MY WIFE OR I ARE TRANSPORTING OURSELVES ALONE OR ONE OF US WITH OUR CHILD.  THE SEAT IS HARDLY EVER-USED OR BEING PUT THROUGH UNNECESSARY WEAR AND TEAR.*JB",
