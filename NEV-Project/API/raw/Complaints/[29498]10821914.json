THE VEHICLE NEVER TRACKED - ALMOST ALL TRAVEL DURING MY OWNERSHIP WERE HIGHWAY MILES (23K).  THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS A FAILURE OF THE NUMBER 1 ROD BEARING.     THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON A WET SINGLE LANE ROAD IN POOR WEATHER.  I WAS LUCKY TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT WHEN VEHICLES FOLLOWING ME WERE CAUGHT UNAWARES BY MY UNEXPECTED DECELERATION. THE WAS LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH SAFETY DUE TO THE CONDITIONS.  I LOST POWER STEERING AND POWER BRAKES WHICH MADE THE CAR MORE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL.",
