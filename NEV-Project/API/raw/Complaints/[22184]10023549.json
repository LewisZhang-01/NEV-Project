DEALER HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE TO REPAIR.  ALL RECALL WORK WAS DONE, INCLUDING THE WIRING HARNESS FIX SC014, BUT THERE WAS NO SYMPTOM OF PROBLEM THEN.  EXTENDED WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED, AND CONTINUALLY FINDING PROBLEM WITH CAR.  ALSO TAIL PIPE RECENTLY BROKE OFF HAD TO BE REPLACED. I NOW HAVE A SPREADSHEET OF THE PROBLEMS AND REPAIRS.  WOULD LIKE TO FIX THIS PROBLEM IF I KNEW WHAT IT WAS.  HAD MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR, THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR, NUMEROUS OTHER PARTS REPLACED AS WELL AS A TUNE UP.  ALSO THE EXHAUST SMELLS BAD.  ENGINE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH PICK UP ON SMALL HILLS EITHER.    *NLM",
