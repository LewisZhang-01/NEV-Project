THE WRANGLER IS TOTALED AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY WILL NOT PAY THE VEHICLE OFF.  WE ARE SHORT $3,000 OF THE PAY OFF.  MY IMMEDIATE CONCERN IS  I WAS GLAD I WAS NOT DRIVING AT THE TIME OF THE FIRE AND DID THIS HAPPEN TO OTHER OWNERS OF A WRANGLER.  THIS CAR IS ONLY GOING INTO 5 YEARS OLD AND HAS HAD THE REAR END REPLACED AT OUR EXPENSE AND THE GAUGES GO ON AND OFF AND THIS WAS FIXED ONCE. WHAT CAUSED THIS ELECTRICAL FIRE?  I WANT JEEP TO RESPOND TO WHY THIS HAPPENED.    *TT",
