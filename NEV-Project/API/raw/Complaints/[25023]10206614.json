        "summary": "THE HYDRAULICS THAT KEEP THE HOOD AND THE BACK OF THE VAN OPEN ARE NOT WORKING.  SO YOU ARE STUCK HOLDING THEM OPEN (AND THEY ARE VERY HEAVY) TO PUT IN GROCERIES, ETC.  MY DAUGHTER HAS HURT HER HEAD A COUPLE OF TIMES TRYING TO HELP ME KEEP IT OPEN TO GET THE GROCERIES OUT.  IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO BE DOING THIS.  THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM ON THE INSIDE SOMETIMES WORKS, SOMETIMES NO.  THE BACK AIR ADAPTER FOR THE A/C KEEPS FALLING OUT OF THE CEILING.  THE A/C ITSELF SOMETIMES WORKS AND SOMETIMES DOESN'T.  THE SEATS IN THE BACK KEEP COMING UNDONE.  THE VAN EATS THE TREAD OF THE TIRES EVEN WITH CONSTANT REPLACEMENT AND ROTATIONS AND BALANCES.  THE SLIDING DOORS STICK ALL THE TIME AND MY DAUGHTERS HAVE ALL HURT THEM SELVES TRYING TO GET IN OR OUT FROM THE SLIDING DOORS.  I AM AFRAID OF CUTTING OFF FINGERS HAVING TO FORCE IT OPEN OR CLOSED.  THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR HANDLE HAS A LATCH THAT BROKE SO THE HANDLE IS HALF ON HALF OFF.  NOW WHEN I FILL UP ON GAS MY VAN WILL JERK WHEN I DRIVE IT OUT OF THE GAS STATION FOR A GOOD 20 MINS.  MY GAS GAGE MOVES!!  I CAN SEE IT DECREASE WHEN I DRIVE.  THE GAS MILEAGE WAS APROX. 18 MPG NOW IT IS DOWN TO 12!!!  THIS CAR IS A DANGER!!  *TR",
