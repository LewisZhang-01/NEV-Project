        "summary": "THE RUBBER HOSE ~7/8\" DIA. JUST ABOVE THE GAS TANK FILLER TUBE, WHICH RELIEVES PRESSURE AND ALLOWS THE TANK TO FILL PROPERLY, CRACKED AND SEPARATED.  WHEN EVER THE TANK WAS FILLED TO THE TOP, FUEL WOULD SPEW ALL OVER THE GROUND.  THE LEAK RAN DOWN FRAME RAILS AND WAS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE, I HAD TO CRAWL UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE, DURING FILLING TO FINALLY LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THE FUEL LEAK. ONCE BEFORE THE LEAK WAS LOCATED, I DUMPED ABOUT A GALLON OF FUEL OR MORE ON THE GROUND, BEFORE I COULD SHUT OFF THE PUMP AS I FILLING MY TANK AND CHECKING THE ENGINE OIL LEVEL AT THE SAME TIME.   I DETERMINED WHERE THE FUEL LEAK WAS EMANATING FROM AFTER SEVERAL OTHER FILLS.  AS MY VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY I REPAIRED THE RUBBER LINE MYSELF (USING A LENGTH OF RUBBER HOSE FROM NAPA) NOT USING THE FORD PART BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME POTENTIAL FOR THE PART TO PREMATURELY FAIL AGAIN, AND ITS QUITE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS THE ONE CLAMP (REQUIRING A MIRROR) SO I DIDN'T WANT TO MAKE THIS REPAIR AGAIN BY USING A FAULTY FORD PART.  THIS PART IS MANUFACTURED WITH A HOSE CLAMP MOLDED INTO ONE END OF THE HOSE.  AS IT USES HEAT TO ENCASE PART OF THE HOSE CLAMP WITH RUBBER TO RETAIN IT ON THE END OF THE HOSE, THIS PROCESS HARDENS THE HOSE AND THE HOSE WILL CRACK AT THE CLAMP.  MY OPINION IS THAT THIS IS AN EXTREME FIRE POTENTIAL.  *NLM",
