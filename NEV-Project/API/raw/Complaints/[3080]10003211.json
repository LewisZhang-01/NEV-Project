I HAVE HAD CONTINUOUS TROUBLE WITH THE TRANSMISSION, THE BRAKES, THE \"PLASTIC\" BUCKET HOLDING RESERVE ANTIFREEZE (CRACKED AND LEAKED ANTIFREEZE)  AND NOW THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WORK WHEN THEY WANT TO WORK (INTERMITTENTLY AND STEADILY).  WHEN I CONTACTED DON JACKSON LINCOLN-MERCURY AT THOSE TIMES WHEN THE PARTS ACTED UP TO ASK THEM IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY RECALLS OR PROBLEMS (AND I CITED EACH AREA EACH TIME I CALLED), I WAS TOLD THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS REPORTED IN ANY OF THESE AREAS WITH THE 97 SABLE.  I FOUND THERE ON THE INTERNET THAT THERE ARE MANY.  I HAVE PAID $2000 FOR THE TRANSMISSION REPAIR, $550 FOR BRAKES, $80 FOR THE ANTIFREEZE BUCKET, AND WENT TO PURCHASE A WIPER MOTOR  ($85)  WHEN I WAS TOLD BY THE AUTO STORE CLERK TO CHECK THE INTERNET, WHICH I AM NOW DOING.  I FIND THAT JACKSON SPARTAN L/M DEALER HAS NOT BEEN HONEST WITH ME AND I WAS NOT NOTIFIED BY DON JACKSON SPARTAN L/M OF THESE FALLACIES.  WHAT CAN I DO?",
