LAST YEAR OUR YOUNGEST SON AND HIS WIFE ALSO PURCHASED A TAHOE (2011).  ALL THREE HAVE DASHBOARDS THAT ARE NOW CRACKING.  OBVIOUSLY A DEFECT IN THE PRODUCT.  IS GM GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM?  FROM WHAT I AM READING IT APPEARS TO BE A NATIONWIDE ISSUE WITH THESE VEHICLES.  THE CRACK IN MY DASH IS RIGHT ABOVE THE AIRBAG.  *TR",
