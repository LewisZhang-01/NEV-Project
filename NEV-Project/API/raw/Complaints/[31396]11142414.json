DID NOT SEE ANYTHING IN THE ENGINE OR UNDER THE CAR THAT WAS LEAKING.  THEN ONE DAY, I OPENED THE HOOD AGAIN AND FOUND THAT A MIST OF GASOLINE WAS COMING FROM A HOLE/CRACK FROM THE FUEL FEED HOSE FITTING AND FUEL FEED LINE THAT RUNS BACK UNDER THE CAR TO THE FUEL TANK.  I NOTIFIED MY MECHANIC AT AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE CENTER AND THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO HIS SHOP.  THEY FOUND THAT THE GASOLINE MADE ITS WAY THROUGH THE O RING AND INTO THE PLASTIC COVERING OF THE METAL FUEL FEED FITTING HOSE LINE AND ATE THROUGH THE PLASTIC AND CAUSED IT TO LEAK.  THE MECHANIC REMOVED THE FUEL TANK AND REPLACED IT WITH A NEW FUEL FEED LINE.  IT COST ME $790.74 TO HAVE IT REPLACED.",
