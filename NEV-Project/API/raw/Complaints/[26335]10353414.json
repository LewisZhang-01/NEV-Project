I DO NOT KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT TO STALL, BUT ON RESIDENTIAL STREET ALL DASH LIGHTS CAME ON AND ENGINE STALLED AND SHUT DOWN WHILE I AM DRIVING. I HAVE CHECKED NUMEROUS SITES WHERE THE STALLING PROBLEM HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AND I EVEN SAW AN ARTICLE WHERE NHTSA HAS STATED THEY ARE WIDENING THEIR INVESTIGATION OF JEEP COMMANDER STALLING PROBLEMS. NEED TO KNOW IF AN OFFICIAL RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR THIS PARTICULAR JEEP COMMANDER YEAR. *TR",
