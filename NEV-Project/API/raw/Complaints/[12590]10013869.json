        "summary": "WHILE LEAVING PARKING LOT IT WAS VERY DARK AS LIGHTS WERE OUT IN FRONT OF AND BEHIND ME AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE BEHIND ME. I PROCEEDED SLOWLY IN REVERSE AND LIGHTLY HIT THE CEMENT BASE OF LIGHT BEHIND ME.  I FELT THE IMPACT ON BACK RIGHT .  I IMMEDIATELY PLACED MY RIGHT FOOT ON THE BRAKE.  THE CAR WAS STOPPED.  I THEN TRIED TO PUT THE CAR INTO DRIVE WHILE DOING THIS I NOTICED THAT THE ENGINE WAS LOUD AND REVVING UP SPEED AND ACTUALLY MOVING WHILE I HAD MY RIGHT FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND NO FOOT ON THE GAS. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT FROM THE REVVING NOISE THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL WAS STUCK.  I CHECKED THIS WITH MY RIGHT FOOT AND FELT THAT THE GAS PEDAL WAS UP AND NOT DOWN AS IT SOUNDED.  I NEXT PUT THE CAR INTO PARK,  WE CONTINUED TO MOVE AT AN ACCELERATED PACE.  I THEN PLACED BOTH MY FEET ON THE BRAKE PEDAL.  I USED AS MUCH FORCE AS I COULD, I DID THIS BY STEPPING ON THE BRAKE WITH BOTH FEET AND PULLING UP ON THE STEERING WHEEL TO GIVE ME MORE FORCE AND PRESSURE.  THE CAR DID NOT SLOW DOWN , DID NOT SKID , SHOWED NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN.  I NEXT PULLED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE AS HARD AS I COULD WITH MY RIGHT HAND, STILL THE CAR DID NOT SLOW DOWN.  THERE WAS A DUMPSTER AHEAD TO MY LEFT, A LARGE PARKING LOT LIGHT WITH A CEMENT BASE TO THE RIGHT AND A FENCE BETWEEN THEM.  I AIMED THE CAR BETWEEN THE DUMPSTER AND LIGHT.  THE CAR WAS STILL ACCELERATING, NO SIGNS OF SLOWING DOWN.  I MADE THE DECISION TO GO OVER THE CURB HIT THE FENCE IN THE HOPES THAT THIS WOULD SLOW THE CAR DOWN IN ORDER TO GAIN CONTROL. WHILE GOING THROUGH THE FENCE BOTH FEET WERE APPLIED TO THE BRAKE, NO FOOT WAS ON THE GAS AND THE EMERGENCY BRAKE WAS UP AND IN PLACE.  WE WENT UP ANOTHER CURB ONTO A ROAD GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION, FOR ANOTHER 100 FEET AND THE CAR SLOWED AND STOPPED. MY 13 YEAR OLD SON WAS WITH ME IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. (A FEW DAYS PRIOR WHILE DRIVING IN A MALL PARKING LOT THE CAR MADE A LOUD NOISE BUT NO IDENTIFIABLE IMPACT TO THE SPEED OR DRIVABILITY OF THE CAR AT THAT TIME.)    *NLM",
