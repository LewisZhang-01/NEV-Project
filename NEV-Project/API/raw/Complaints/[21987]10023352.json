AFTER SHIFTING INTO 4TH (AND SOMETIMES 5TH) GEAR, TRANSMISSION WILL \"POP\" OUT OF GEAR INTO A \"PHANTOM NEUTRAL\" CONDITION.  THIS MAINLY HAPPENS UNDER ACCELERATION BUT CAN HAPPEN DURING CRUISING (SEEMS TO \"FALL\" OUT OF GEAR).  THE LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED WAS WHILE PASSING ANOTHER VEHICLE WHICH CREATED A VERY TENSE MOMENT DUE TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC CONDITIONS.   *NLM",
