WE HAVE CONTACTED BRITAX AND WERE TOLD THAT WHEN THE SEAT WAS IN THE REAR FACING POSITION, THAT WE HAD IT TOO TIGHT AND THAT IT IS NOT A SAFETY CONCERN!!  WE HAD IT INSTALLED BY A CHP CHILD SAFETY OFFICER.  AND THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT SEATS ARE NOT IN TIGHT ENOUGH.  EACH BRITAX REPRESENTATIVE WE SPOKE WITH WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND SAID IT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE.  IN OUR OPINION THIS IS THEN A MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND SHOUL BE REPAIRED.",
