I WAS STANDING ON THE BACK OF THE TAILGATE LOADING A 13 HP LAWN MOWER INTO THE BACK OF THE TRUCK USING RAMPS AND RIGHT SIDE STRAP BROKE, AND THE LEFT BROKE WITHIN ONE SECOND OF THE RIGHT BREAKING.  ACCORDING TO THE DEALER IT IS UNDER WARRANTY.  HOWEVER, THIS SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH THESE VEHICLES.  THE LOCAL DEALER SAYS THEY CHANGE AT LEAST ONE SET A DAY ON PICKUPS.  GMC KNOWS THIS IS A PROBLEM AND NO RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED.*AK",
