FORD HAS LOOKED INTO THE PROBLEM, CHANGED PARTS, SENT AN ENGINEER, ETC.  IT STILL HAPPENS.  CONTINUOSLY CALLED FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE AFTER MY DEALER HEARD NOTHING FROM REGIONAL (WHICH WAS WHERE THE PROBLEM IS NOW DIRECTED)  CUSTOMER SERVICE SAYS THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING, BECAUSE REGIONAL IS OVER THEIR HEADS.  MY DEALER TOLD FORD AND I HAVE TOLD FORD THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE, AS IT HAS HAPPENED WHILE THE CAR WAS IN GEAR AND MOVING IN REVERSE.  CANNOT GET ANY HELP.  WHERE CAN I GO?  ALSO, THE FIRST TIME I REPORTED THIS PROBLEM AND HAD IT TAKEN TO THE DEALER WAS OVER A YEAR AGO.",
