THE VIBRATION CAN, AT TIMES, SHAKE YOUR HANDS BACK AND FORTH AS THE WHEEL IS GRIPPED.  OTHER PEOPLE I KNOW THAT OWN ELANTRAS COMPLAIN OF THE SAME PROBLEM.  I HAVE CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND HYUNDAI CUSTOMER SERVICE SEVERAL TIMES, BUT NOBODY SEEMS TO HAVE ANY SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.  THE DATE PROVIDED IS THE FIRST TIME I HAD THE VEHICLE IN TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT THE CAR FOR THE VIBRATION.  I FIRST REPORTED IT DURING THE 12 MONTH/12,000 FREE ADJUSTMENT PERIOD.  SINCE THEN, THE CAR HAS BEEN TO TWO DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS TO ATTEMPT TO FIX THE VIBRATION.  THE LAST SERVICE DONE TO TRY TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM WAS A RADIAL FORCE BALANCE.  THIS SEEMED TO HELP SLIGHTLY, BUT THE VIBRATION STILL PERSISTED AND REMAINS ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE.*JB",
