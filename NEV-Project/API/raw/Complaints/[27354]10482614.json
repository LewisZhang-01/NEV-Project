WHEN I CAME BACK I DROVE CAR AND IT STALLED AGAIN AT ABOUT 35 AND THEN IT DIDN'T WANT TO START.  I GOT IT STARTED AND THE \"SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT\" CAME ON.  IT STALLED 2 MORE TIMES IN MOTION AFTER THAT AND I BROUGHT IT TO NISSAN.. THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME $689.  I THEN TOOK  IT TO MY PERSONAL MECHANICS SHOP WHO CHARGED ME $375 FOR THE SAME THING WITH NISSAN PARTS.. I GO HOME AND FIND OUT THAT THERE WAS A RECALL #R2022 ON THE 2003 350Z NISSAN.. IT SHOWS UNDER THE NHTSA THAT THIS WAS A SAFETY ISSUE AND COULD RESULT IN CRASH..  WHEN I CALLED NISSAN ON THIS THEY TOLD ME MY VIN DOESN'T FALL UNDER THE RECALL.   IF THIS WAS A SAFETY ISSUED RECALL THEN ALL THE 2003 NISSAN 350Z SHOULD BE UNDER IT.  I CHECKED ONLINE AND FOUND LOTS OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAD SAME ISSUES SO ITS A HAZARD FOR SURE YET NISSAN IS ONLY BACKING UP SOME OF THE VINS UNDER THIS SAFETY ISSUED RECALL... PLZ HELP AND TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO TO GET MY $375 BACK...  *TR",
