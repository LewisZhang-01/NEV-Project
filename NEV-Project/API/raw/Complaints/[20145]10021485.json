OUR CERTIFIED CADILLAC MECHANIC SAID THAT MOST CARS HAVE METAL GAS LINES NOT PLASTIC. THE PLASTIC HOSES ARE MOLDED INTO THE FUEL INJECTION SYSTEM SO WHEN THEY CRACK WITH AGE, THEY HAVE TO REPLACE THE WHOLE SYSTEM  NOT JUST THE PLASTIC LINES. HOW WOULD ANYONE KNOW THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM - ONLY BECAUSE THE FUMES BECAME MORE INTENSE DID I TAKE IT IN. I HAD BEEN DRIVING THE CAR WITH PASSENGERS FOR THREE WEEKS PRIOR AND THE CAR COULD CATCH ON FIRE AND POSSIBLY EXPLODED. IT HAS APPROXIMATELY 79,000 MILES ON THE ODOMETER.  *JB",
