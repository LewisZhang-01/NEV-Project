        "summary": "TRANSMISSION ON 1993 DODGE CARAVAN IS FAILING ONCE AGAIN. I SEE THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY A WEB SITE DEDICATED TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. THE TRANSMISSION WAS REBUIT AT APPROXIMATELY 40,000 MILES. THE VEHICLE NOW HAS 70,000+ MILES AND IS IN NEED FOR ITS NEXT RE-BUILD. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW DODGE HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH NOT HAVING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE PROBLEM TRANSMISSONS. THE WARANTEE IS OVER AND THE COST OF THE REPAIR WILL PROBABLY BE BETWEEN $1500 AND $2000. CAN ANYTHING BE DONE? TO READ SOME STORIES FROM OTHER CARAVAN OWNERS, GO TO GOOGLE.COM AND TYPE IN \"DODGE CARAVAN TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS\". IT MAKES FOR SOME INTERESTING READING!    THANK YOU...",
