THIS WAS THE MOST EXPENSIVE USED CAR I HAD EVER OWNED AND WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD BEFORE WE BOUGHT IT..WE CHECKED THE VIN REPORT ON CARFAX...WE HAD THE VEHICLE CHECKED OUT BY OUR OWN MECHANIC. I THOUGHT I HAD FOUND A GREAT (DREAM FOR ME)VEHICLE. BEN SATCHER FORD IN SC SAID THERE WAS NO RECALL ON THIS CAR ONLY THE 95 MODEL AND THAT PROBLEM HAD BEEN SINCE FIXED. SO I'M STUCK WITH PAYING $3000 FOR A NEW ENGINE WHILE I STILL OWE $6000 ON MY VEHICLE. THIS VEHICLE IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN TRANSPORT MY 3 CHILDREN AROUND TOGETHER, OUR OTHER VEHICLE IS A PICK-UP WITH ONLY FRONT SEATS...SO WERE STRANDED.",
