AT FIRST THE LIGHT JUST KEPT SWITCHING ON AND OFF WHENEVER THE PASSENGER WOULD SHIFT IN THE SEAT BUT NOW IT SAYS THAT IT'S NOT ACTIVATED ALL THE TIME AND WE BELIEVE IT'S A FAULTY SENSOR. THE 2007 MODEL WAS RECALLED FOR THIS EXACT ISSUE AND THE 2008 SHOULD BE AS WELL. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE FOR SURE AND WITH SO MANY COMPLAINTS ACROSS THE BOARD BY OWNERS OF THIS CAR IT SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF AT NO EXPENSE TO THE OWNER. THE MANUFACTURER HAS PUT THEIR CUSTOMERS IN DANGER.",
