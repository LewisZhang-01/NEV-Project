THEY SAID THERE WAS NO RECALL AND THAT THE BRAKES NEEDED TO BE REPLACED FOR BOTH FRONT AND REAR.  I FEEL THAT THIS 2003 NISSAN MAXIMA SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD SUCH A PROBLEM WITH SO LITTLE MILES ON THEM, AND FROM MY TALKS WITH OTHERS.  I HEARD THAT THEIR HAVE BEEN A LOT OF BRAKE REPAIRS GOING ON AT THIS NISSAN DEALER.  I JUST FEEL THAT THE TOP OF THE LINE CAR AT NISSAN SHOULD NOT HAVE THIS KIND OF PROBLEM.  I WAS GIVING THEM ANOTHER CHANCE SINCE MY OTHER 2000 MAXIMA HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM BUT THERE WAS A RECALL ON THOSE ROTORS AND BRAKES.  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH NISSAN NOW AND MAY NOT BUY ANOTHER OF THEIR PRODUCTS AGAIN.  *JB",
