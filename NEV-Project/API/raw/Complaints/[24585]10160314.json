        "summary": "323I BMW 4 DOOR, 2000.  MAJOR PROBLEM WITH ALL MY POWER WINDOWS GOING OUT.  THE SERVICE REP AT THE DEALER JUST SHRUGS HIS SHOULDERS AND SAYS \"IT HAPPENS\".  I SAID THAT FOUR POWER WINDOWS TO GO OUT IN SIX YEARS IS EXCESSIVE.  THREE OF WHICH ARE HARDLY EVER USED SINCE I AM THE ONLY ONE EVER IN THE CAR.  HE REPLIED THAT YOU DON'T BUY A BMW TO BE EASY ON THE CHECKBOOK.  I SAID I BOUGHT ONE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY WERE RELIABLE.  HE ACTED LIKE THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.  6/20/06 RIGHT REAR  WINDOW REGULATOR WENT OUT $394.16, 9/2/04 DRIVERS WINDOW REGULATOR WENT OUT $340.43, 10/27/03 PASSENGER WINDOW REGULATOR WENT OUT APPROX. $350, 10/27/03 SUNROOF WINDOW FAILED AND THEY DID A TEMPORARY FIX AT A COST OF $264.54 AND SAID IT WAS NOT GUARANTEED.  IT WOULD COST AN ADDITIONAL $1665!  APPARENTLY ALL THE SLIDERS WERE BROKEN.  I PROBABLY ONLY OPENED THE SUNROOF A DOZEN TIMES IN THE THREE YEAR PERIOD, THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE GONE OUT WITH SUCH LITTLE USE.  NONE OF THESE WERE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY SINCE THEY ALL OCCURRED THREE YEARS AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR NEW.  I HAVE HAD MANY OTHER THINGS GO OUT IN THIS CAR COSTING CLOSE TO $10,000 TO REPAIR IN THE PAST SIX YEARS.  SEEMS EXCESSIVE TO ME.  LAST TIME I COMMENTED ON THIS THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP SAID QUOTE \"IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE FROM HERE\".  I WILL NOT BE BUYING ANOTHER BMW.  *JB",
