THE DOOR CONTINUED TO MAKE LOUD CLICKING AND CRUNCHING NOISES AND WOULD NOT OPEN MORE THAT AN INCH OR SO.   IT HAD TO BE FORCEFULLY SHUT IN ORDER TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE.  SIMILAR THINGS HAPPENED AGAIN WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT TO THE DEALER TO DETERMINE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.  THE DEALER SAID THE CAUSE WAS THE AUTOMATIC DOOR MECHANISMS. THE VELOCITY AT WHICH THE PLASTIC PIECES AND CABLE FLUNG OUT COULD SERIOUSLY INJURE SOMEONE.  THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE RECALLED AND REPAIRED FREE OF CHARGE SINCE IT COULD CAUSE SERIOUS EYE INJURY FROM DEFECTIVE PARTS.",
