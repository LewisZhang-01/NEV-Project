WITHIN THE LAST 2 MONTHS OF THIS YEAR, BOTH OF MY REAR DOORS ARE HAVING PROBLEMS, THE PASSENGER SIDE BUZZES WHEN THE LOCK , THE DRIVER SIDE PASSENGER DOOR (WHICH IS THE BIG ISSUE) HAS TOTALLY QUIT OPENING, IT UNLOCKS BUT WILL NOT OPEN FROM THE INSIDE OR OUT.     WHEN I TOLD THE SERVICE MAN AT THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP, HE SAID \"THAT THEY SEE A LOT OF TUSCONS WITH DOOR ISSUES\" AND THAT IT WILL NOT BE CHEAP.    I STARTED LOOKING ON THE INTERNET AND THERE ARE PEOPLE COMPLAINING THAT THE DOORS JUST STOP WORKING AND THAT IT IS DUE TO BAD WORKMANSHIP ON HYUNDAI PART.   I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IF THE DOOR DOES NOT OPEN AND THERE WAS A ISSUE THAT PASSENGERS NEEDED TO GET OUT IN A HURRY THEY COULD NOT.",
