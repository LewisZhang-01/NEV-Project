        "summary": "I HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM WHEN I TURN LEFT! SOMETIMES IT WILL AND MOST OF THE TIME I HAVE TO BREAK A SWEAT. I HAD THE POWER STEERING PUMP REPLACED AND THE PROBLEM STILL IS THERE. I HAVE FOUND SEVERAL DIFFERENT COMPLAINTS AND RECALLS OF GM VEHICLES THAT HAVE RACK AND PINION DEFICIENCIES. TO GET MY RACK AND PINION REPLACE IT WILL COST ME $600 FOR THE PART AND TEN HOURS OF LABOR. DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE TO REMOVE THE ENGINE JUST TO GET TO IT. NOW, I M A SERGEANT IN THE US ARMY AND I AM STATIONED IN GERMANY. THE CLOSEST THING I HAVE TO GM IS AN OPEL DEALER. I SPOKE TO OLDSMOBILE AND THEY SAY THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY RECALLS OR COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE RACK AND PINION ON FILE. THIS IS BS. LOOK AT THE NHTSA WEB SITE AND YOU WILL FIND HUNDREDS OF THEM. OR JUST SEARCH FOR OLDS INTRIGUE STEERING PROBLEMS. I TAKE CARE OF MY CAR AND I KEEP UP THE SERVICES. I EVEN HAD IT SPONSORED BY AUDIOBAHN DOING CAR SHOWS. I JUST WANT THE RIGHT ANSWERS. IS THIS MY PROBLEM OR IS IT THE MANUFACTURES?   *NLM",
