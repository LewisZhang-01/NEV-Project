        "summary": "I PURCHASED A FORD FOCUS IN MAY 2013 BRAND NEW FROM A DEALERSHIP. FOR THE FIRST 6-8 MONTHS THE CAR DROVE FINE. STARTING IN JANUARY 2014 I NOTICED MY TRANSMISSION WAS GRINDING THROUGH OUT EACH GEAR WHICH IS ODD BECAUSE I DRIVE AN AUTOMATIC. I HAVE TAKEN IT IN FOUR TIMES FOR REPAIRS COVERED IN MY 36000 MILE WARRANTY AND THE PROBLEM STILL PERSISTS. THE CAR WILL VIBRATE AND SHUDDER AND JERK WHEN I'M ACCELERATING AS WELL AS THE PERSISTENT GRINDING. THE GRINDING SOUNDS AS IF SOMEONE PUT GRAVEL ROCKS IN MY TRANSMISSION. I HAVE SEARCHED IN ONLINE FORUMS AND YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND FOUND THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF OTHER PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE EXACT SAME PROBLEMS AND THAT THEIR LOCAL DEALERSHIPS HAVE ALSO BEEN UNABLE TO REPAIR THEM PROPERLY. I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING MY CAR WHEN THE TRANSMISSION FEELS AS IF IT COULD GO OUT AT ANY SECOND. A FEW OTHERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN ABLE TO LEMON LAW THEIR VEHICLE DO TO THESE PROBLEMS. IF IT CANT BE RESOLVED I WONT BE PURCHASING FROM FORD AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. MY CURRENT MILEAGE IS AT 14,000 AND THE PROBLEMS ARE STILL OCCURRING.  *JS",
