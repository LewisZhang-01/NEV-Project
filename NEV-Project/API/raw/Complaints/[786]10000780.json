I CALLED THE HONDA DEALER IN MAPLEWOOD, MINNESOTA TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT THE PROBLEM.  THEY WERE UNABLE TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION AND CHARGED ME $95 FOR THEIR TIME TO DIAGNOSE.  IS THIS A SAFETY ISSUE IF I GET INTO AN ACCIDENT WITH A FAUTLY SEATBELT?  HOW DO YOU THINK I SHOULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM, SINCE THE HONDA DEALER CANNOT EVEN FIX THE PROBLEM.        THE YEAR IS 2003, WHICH IS NOT AN OPTION ON INCIDENT DATE.",
