        "summary": "RE: 2001 FORD SVT LIGHTNING    MY VEHICLE VIOLENTLY EJECTED A SPARK PLUG FROM THE ENGINE'S HEAD, WHILE MERGING ON A HIGHWAY ON-RAMP.  UPON FAILURE, THE VEHICLE OBVIOUSLY STARTED MISFIRING, BUCKING, AND WAS A HANDFUL WHEN PULLING OVER TO SIDE OF THE ROAD.    FORD ONLY USED 4 SETS OF THREADS ON THEIR LIGHTINING HEADS FROM 1999 TO EARLY 2003.  CONVENTIONAL HEADS TYPICALLY USE BETWEEN 8 AND 10 THREADS TO HOLD A PLUG, BUT FORD DESIGNED THEIR HEADS WITH ONLY 4 THREADS ON MANY MODULAR 5.4-LITER V8 MOTORS TOO (NOT JUST THE LIGHTNING).  THEY HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM, AS THEY HAVE CHANGED THE HEAD DESIGN IN EARLY 2003 TO A NEW PART WITH 8 THREADS.  BUT FORD HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL FOR OLDER LIGHTNINGS (AND OTHER F-150'S), EVEN THOUGH THIS COULD BE A POTENTIAL SAFETY PROBLEM (FIRE, LOSS OF CONTROL, ETC.).  I HAVE ALREADY HAD MY HEAD REPLACED WITH ANOTHER INFERIOR 4-THREAD DESIGN, AND I WONDER WHEN THE NEXT PLUG WILL BE BLOWN FROM MY ENGINE.  I WOULD LIKE TO SEE NHTSA ENCOURAGE FORD TO RETROFIT ALL AFFECTED VEHICLES AS THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR MANY LIGHTNING OWNERS.",
