IT HAS ALSO SKIPPED 1ST AND 2ND GEAR AND GOTTEN STUCK IN 3RD GEAR AND BARELY ABLE TO MOVE MORE THAN 5 MPH.  IT HAS HAPPENED FROM A DEAD STOP AS WELL AS WHILE DRIVING 40 PLUS MILES PER HOUR. TYPICALLY PULLING OVER AND TURNING THE TRUCK OFF AND BACK ON FIXES IT. I AM AFRAID IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.",
