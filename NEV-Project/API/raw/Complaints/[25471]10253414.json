        "summary": "THE 2006 MAZDA5 CAUSES EXCESSIVE WEAR ON TIRES QUITE FREQUENTLY.  I PURCHASED MY MAZDA5 NEW IN AUGUST 2006, AND SINCE THEN, I'VE HAD TO PURCHASE 2 SETS OF TIRES FOR THIS CAR DUE TO THE TIRES WEARING ON THE INSIDE EDGE.  THE 2ND SET OF TIRES THAT WERE REPLACED WERE SO BAD, THAT THE SERVICE PERSON AT THE DEALERSHIP RECOMMEND THAT I DO NOT DRIVE THE CAR OFF THE LOT BECAUSE THE TIRES HARD WORN SO BADLY AND COULD BLOW OUT AT ANY MOMENT.  THOSE TIRES HAD ONLY ABOUT 26000 MILES ON THEM!  THE LAST SET OF TIRES THAT WAS PURCHASED IN FEBRUARY 2008 ARE NOW BEGINNING TO SHOW THE SAME WEAR ON THE INSIDE EDGES OF ALL TIRES.  THESE TIRES HAVE ONLY ABOUT 18000 MILES ON THEM.  THE TIRE WEAR OCCURRED EVEN AFTER I HAD THE RECOMMENDED MAINTENANCE (ROTATION, BALANCE, ALIGNMENT) PERFORMED.  I'VE READ FORUMS ONLINE WHERE SEVERAL OTHER OWNERS OF THE 2006 MAZDA5 ARE HAVING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM.  I'VE CALLED MAZDA CUSTOMER SERVICE TO SEE IF THE MANUFACTURER HAS REPORTED ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE CARS SUSPENSION, TOE, ANGLES, ETC, BUT NOTHING HAS BEEN REPORTED, NOR HAS THE CAR BEEN RECALLED FOR THIS PROBLEM.   MAZDA CORP NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING BEFORE SOMEONE GETS TRAGICALLY HURT DUE TO THIS PROBLEM.   IF I HAD NOT BROUGHT MY CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP FOR ANOTHER MECHANICAL REASON IN FEBRUARY 2008, I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT MY TIRES HAD WORN SO BADLY, ESPECIALLY SINCE I HAD RECENTLY PURCHASED THE TIRES.  I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE TIRES, BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE.  THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE CAR. I'VE HAD 3 DIFFERENT NAME BRAND TIRES ON THIS CAR, SO THE PROBLEM IS DEFINITELY NOT THE TIRES.  IT'S THE CAR! *TR",
