THIS CAR HAS CHRONIC POWER PROBLEMS.  EVEN WHEN I PRESS THE GAS, CAR DOES NOT PICK UP AS EXPECTED.  IN OTHER WORDS, THE CAR CANNOT BE DRIVEN SMOOTHLY.  I HAVE REPORTED THIS MATTER MANY TIME TO HYUNDAI DEALERS AND THEY DO NOT SEEMS TO BE SERIOUS IN ATTENDING TO THIS PROBLEM.  THEY HAVE INFORMED ME THAT THIS IS THE OPERATIONAL CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS VEHICLE. AS I AM REQUIRED TO CONSTANTLY APPLY PRESSURE ON THE GAS, I HAVE DEVELOPED PAIN IN MY LEGS AND SHOULDERS.  IT IS STRESSFUL TO CONCENTRATE ON THE FREE TRAFFIC WITH THIS PROBLEM IN THE VEHICLE.  I REQUEST YOU TO HELP ME FIXING THIS PROBLEM FROM THE MANUFACTURERS.   THANKS.     *NLM",
