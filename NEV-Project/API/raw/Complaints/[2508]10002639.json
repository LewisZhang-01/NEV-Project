WE ARE A SECURITY FIRM AND THUS WE HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A HIGH SPEED CHASE AND ONLY DRIVE THE VEHICLE ON RESIDENTIAL STREETS.  WE HAVE THREE OTHER DIFFERENT VEHICLES AND HAVE NOT HAD BRAKE PROBLEMS WITH THEM.  IT WAS SUGGESTED BY THE DEALER THAT WE ARE MISUSING THE BRAKES.  I HAVE TALKED WITH ANOTHER POLICE AGENCY IN THE AREA AND THEY HAVE ALSO HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS AS WE.  I BELIEVE THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES THAT COME WITH THE POLICE PACKAGE OPTION.",
