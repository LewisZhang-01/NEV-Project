AS I WAS INCHING ALONG IN THE TRAFFIC, I HAD COME TO A COMPLETE STOP.  AT WHICH POINT, THE VEHICLE STARTED TO ACCELERATE ON ITS OWN AGAIN.  THE VEHICLE CAME WITHIN INCHES OF CRASHING INTO THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME.  LUCKILY, I THOUGHT FAST AND THREW THE VEHICLE INTO NEUTRAL, IT CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE VERY HIGH FOR A FEW SECONDS, I WAITED UNTIL IT CAME DOWN BEFORE CONTINUING TO DRIVE.  I DROVE HOME AND CALLED ROCKINGHAM HONDA SERVICE, SPOKE TO DAVID JOSEPHS TO NOTIFY HIM OF THE RE-OCCURRENCE OF THIS PROBLEM.  I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO ROCKINGHAM HONDA AGAIN BY AAA.    ROCKINGHAM HONDA HAD THE VEHICLE FOR 2 DAYS, THERE WERE NO CODES STORED AND THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.",
