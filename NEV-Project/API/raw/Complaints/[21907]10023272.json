THE POWER LOCKS SHUTS OPEN AND LOCKS ON IT'S OWN, THE VEHICLE IS NOT RELIABLE WHEN CROSSING  A HIGHWAY ON OUR STREET. VEHICLE STALLS AT THE POINT OF ACCELERATION AND DOES NOT RESPOND TO PRESSING OF GAS PEDAL. WHEN CAR ELECTRICAL SYSTEM FAILS AND YOU ARE IN THE VEHICLE THE POWER LOCKS DO NOT OPERATE CAUSING DRIVER AND PASSENGERS TO BE LOCKED IN VEHICLE. I WAS RECENTLY LOCKED IN MY VEHICLE WITH MY DAUGHTER FOR EXACTLY 4 HOURS WHEN THE POWER FINALLY RETURNED AND I WAS ABLE TO GET OUT. I CONTACTED KIA MOTORS CORP. AND WAS SIMPLY NOT TAKEN SERIOUS WITH THIS COMPLAINT. I HOPE THAT YOU FOLLOW UP WITH MANUFACTURES POSSIBLE DEATH TRAP AND THAT NO LOSES THEIR LIFE.   *JB",
