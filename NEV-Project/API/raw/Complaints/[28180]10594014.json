I STOPPED AND TRIED AGAIN, LISTENING MORE INTENTLY NOW, THE SOUND PERSISTED. AT THAT TIME SOMEONE RAN UP TO ME AND SAID I SHOULD DISENGAGE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, BUT IT WASN'T ON. I THEN ENGAGED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE AND RELEASED SAME FOR EFFECT, BUT THAT DID NOT HELP. I TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE, REMOVED THE KEY, AND LET IT SIT FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES, THEN TRIED AGAIN, BUT NO GOOD. FROM MY PARKED POSITION NOW, I TRIED GOING BACKWARDS, AND DISCOVERED THE SOUND HAD \"STOPPED\", EXCEPT THAT WHEN I MOVED FORWARD, IT WAS EVER SO LOUD. AT THIS WRITING, NOT SURE WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, WE'VE HAD THE VEHICLE FOR ABOUT A YEAR WITH NO ISSUES UNTIL NOW.  *TR",
