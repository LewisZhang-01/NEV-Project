MY ENGINE FAILURE LIGHT WENT ON AGAIN YESTERDAY, BUT MY DEALERSHIP REFUSES TO ACCEPT THE CAR FOR SERVICE UNTIL IT ACTUALLY BREAKS DOWN. I TRANSPORT THREE SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN IN THIS CAR AND OFTEN MUST BE ON THE INTERSTATE. I FEEL I WILL BE UNABLE TO CONTROL THE CAR IF THE FAILURE HAPPENS AT HIGH SPEED ON THE INTERSTATE OR IN HEAVY TRAFFIC. IT SEEMS INEVITABLE THAT SOMEONE SOMEWHERE IS GOING TO BE KILLED OR INJURED BECAUSE OF THIS. SO I WANTED TO BRING IT TO YOUR ATTENTION.",
