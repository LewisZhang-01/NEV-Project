I IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT IT TO SHOWCASE NISSAN, IN BOURNE MASSACHUSETTS (508-759-4400) TO HAVE THE RECALL WORK PERFORMED. THEY CHECKED MY VIN NUMBER, AND AFTER CONFIRMING THAT MY CAR WAS COVERED UNDER THAT RECALL WE SET AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THE WORK PERFORMED. A FEW DAYS AFTER DROPPING THE CAR OFF I CALLED THEM TO FIND OUT THE STATUS. I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE WRITER THAT MY CAR HAS HAD THE MOTOR REPLACED AND THE MOTOR THAT IS IN IT HAS TOP-FEED INJECTORS WHICH ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THE RECALL. I FOUND THIS ODD SINCE ALL THE YEARS OF THE MOTOR THAT ARE IN MY CAR (VG30ET) HAVE THIS PROBLEM, AND ARE COVERED UNDER MY WARRANTY. SO I CALLED THE NISSAN CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER TO ASK THEM WHY MY CAR WOULDN'T BE COVERED. THE PERSON I SPOKE WITH TOLD ME HE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT AND GIVE ME A CALL BACK AFTER HE SPOKE WITH SHOWCASE NISSAN. LATER THAT DAY HE CALLED ME, CONFIRMING WHAT THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME ABOUT MY TYPE OF INJECTORS NOT HAVING THAT PROBLEM. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH, I WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM FROM A FEW DIFFERENT RELIABLE SOURCES THAT WHAT I WAS TOLD BY THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP WAS A LOAD OF CRAP. I AM TROUBLED BY THIS AS MY CAR CAN BURST INTO FLAMES AT ANY MOMENT, AND NISSAN IS TAKING THIS AS A GAME, IT IS NOT.   *NLM",
