        "summary": "AFTER BUYING A BRAND NEW SAFETY 1ST FORWARD FACING/BOOSTER FOR UP TO 100LBS. FOR MY SON, I WENT HOME TO INSTALL IT. I READ THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL, THEN I PLACED IT IN MY 92 CHEVY ASTRO VAN, TIGHTENED THE STRAPS, AND PUT THE LOCKING CLIP ON, I NOTICED A BULGE IN THE BACK OF THE SEAT. THE MANUAL TOLD ME TO PUT THE PATH OF THE SEAT BELT BEHIND THE SEAT FOR FORWARD FACING. HOWEVER, THIS  (RECOMMENDED) PLACEMENT PUT THE SEAT BELT IN MY CHILDS BACK BECAUSE THERE IS NO PLASTIC SUPPORT FROM THE SHOULDER SUPPORTS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEAT! THERE IS ONLY CLOTH THAT SEPARATES THE CHILD FROM THE SEAT BELT PATH. LUCKILY, I NOTICED THE BULKINESS AND FELT IT. OTHERWISE, IN AN ACCIDENT, MY CHILD'S BACK WOULD PROBABLY BEEN PERMANENTLY INJURED DUE TO HIS BACK NOT BEING PROTECTED FROM THE HARD METAL SEAT BELT!! I PROMPTLY REMOVED THE SEAT FROM MY VEHICLE AND RETURNED IT TO WAL-MART FOR A REFUND. I THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE WITH SEVERAL SEATS SOLD AT WAL-MART AS I AM HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME FINDING A SEAT FOR MY CHILD THAT DOES HAVE FULL BACK SUPPORT. I AM UNSURE IF THIS IS A RESULT OF MY CAR, OR THE SEATS THEMSELVES. BUT, I  FEAR MY CHILDS BACK WOULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED IN AN ACCIDENT BY THE SEAT BELT ITSELF IF NOT THE ACCIDENT!*JB",
