I CHECKED MY MANUAL AND READ THAT THE AIR BAG DOESN'T NEED MAINTENANCE SERVICE AND IF THE LIGHT STAYED ON, SOMETHING WITH THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM MAY BE THE FAULT. IT SUGGESTED THAT SENSOR'S MAY BE AT FAULT IN DIFFERENT AREA'S OF THE CAR AND TO SIT UPRIGHT. I MADE SURE WHEN GETTING BACK IN MY CAR TO SIT AS FAR BACK AS POSSIBLE IN THE SEAT. IT DIDN'T COME ON, BUT HAS REOCCURRED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THE FIRST TIME. WITH THE RECENT RECALLS, I AM WONDERING IF THIS IS ALSO UNDER THAT RECALL WITH THE IGNITION AND SEATBELTS.  *TR",
