WHEN THE DASH LIGHTS BLINK BACK ON , THE LIGHTING BRIGHTNESS SWITCH DOES NOT WORK,  THE ROLLER TO MAKE IT BRIGHTER DOES NOT DIM THE DASH LIGHTS,  UNTIL THEY ALL JUST GO OFF AGAIN.?  THE TIRE SENSORS ALL GO OFF AND THERE IS NO READINGS FOR TIRE PRESSURE.  YOU CHECK THE TIRE PRESSURE MANUALLY AND THEY ARE ALL OK.     THE DOOR LOCKS DON'T WORK PROPERLY.  IF YOU USE THE KEY FOB, THE DOORS WILL LOCK AND THEN YOU CAN'T GET THEM OPEN AGAIN WITH THE KEY FOB AND YOU ARE STUCK.  THE KEY IN THE DOOR WON'T EVEN OPEN THE DOOR,  IT IS LOCKED UP TIGHT.  I HAVE TAKEN IT INTO THE DEALER UNDER WARRANTY 3 TIMES AND THEY CAN FIND NOTHING WRONG.  I JUST DON'T LOCK MY CAR ANYMORE.   *TR",
