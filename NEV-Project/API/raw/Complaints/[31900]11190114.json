        "summary": "AS WITH ALL OTHER POSTINGS THE REAR PASSENGER WHEEL WELL HAS COMPLETELY RUSTED OUT.AND THE CAR STARTED MAKING VERY LOUD CLUNKING NOISES. I DO NOT KNOW THE EXACT MOMENT THE WHEEL WELL COMPLETELY DEGRADED. THE REPAIR SHOP SAID IT IS NOT REPAIRABLE. SO WE ARE JUST NOW OUT A CAR.  I JUST SPENT WAY TOO LONG CHATTING WITH SOMEONE FROM FORD WHO GAVE ME A POSTAL ADDRESS TO SEND A COMPLAINT TO. I THINK EVERYONE WHO HAS HAD THE ISSUE SHOULD SEND A COMPLAINT.   MAIL: FORD MOTOR COMPANY CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP CENTER, P.O. BOX 6248, DEARBORN, MI 48126, I AM ALSO CONSIDERING HIRING A LAWYER. I THINK THIS IS JUST WRONG. MY SON IS A COLLEGE STUDENT AND LEFT WITHOUT A CAR WHEN THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN INFERIOR PRODUCT AND I CAN NOT BELIEVE THIS IS THE SERVICE THAT FORD WANTS TO PROVIDE. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A PART OF THE LAWSUIT PLEASE CONTACT ME AT [XXX]. THIS IS INSANE THAT THEY HAVE ADMITTED THE ISSUE, RECALLED THE FRONT END, CAME UP WITH AN INFERIOR SOLUTION AND NOW ARE GOING TO JUST SAY THERE IS NO RECALL. THIS IS A DANGEROUS ISSUE. THEY AT THE VERY LEAST SHOULD BUY PEOPLES ESCAPES FOR THE VALUE THEY WOULD BE WORTH.     INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6). *TT",
