I WAS LUCKY THERE WAS A FIRE STATION RIGHT THERE TO ASSIST ME. FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NO FIRE. THE LOCAL GM MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE SEEN ALOT OF THESE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS (FUEL RAIL). WHEN I CONTACTED GM, THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION ON THIS PROBLEM TO WARRANT A SEARCH. I SAID THAT MY WIFE DROVE THE CAR THE NIGHT BEFORE AND IT COULD HAVE BURNED HER TO DEATH. HE SAID THAT HE WAS SORRY, BUT COULDN'T HELP ME AT THIS TIME. *AK   FAULTY FUEL RAIL PROBLEM.   *SC    *JB",
