        "summary": "TWO WEEKS AGO I WAS DRIVING ON NJ ROUT 9 WHEN THE TRANSMISSION SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS IN NEUTRAL BUT IT WASN'T. ALL THE WARNING LIGHTS WERE ON AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE TO A SAFE AREA AND STOP. I DID NOT TURN THE CAR OFF AND EXITED THE CAR AND TRIED TO OPEN THE REAR DOORS AND HATCH BUT COULDN'T. NEXT I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND WAITED A FEW MINUTES BEFORE STARTING IT. WHEN IT STARTED, ALL WAS FINE. THE NEXT MORNING I DROVE IT TO A TRANSMISSION SHOP WITHOUT INCIDENT. THERE WAS ONLY 62,000 MILES ON IT AT THE TIME BUT THE WARRANTY EXPIRED BECAUSE IT WAS MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS. THE OSS WAS REPLACED AT A COST OF 750.00. THIS IS NOT THE FIRS MAJOR ISSUE WITH THIS VEHICLE. LESS THAN ONE YEAR AGO TWO COILS FAULTED CAUSING A BACK FEED OF TOO MUCH VOLTAGE TO THE COMPUTER CAUSING IT TO FRY. A COST OF MORE THAN 3,000.00 TO REPAIR.",
