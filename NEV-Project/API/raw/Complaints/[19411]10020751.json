IT WAS RAINING HARD AT THE TIME AND MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS STOPPED WORKING.  I COULD HEAR THE MOTOR RUNNING BUT THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WERE NOT MOVING.  I WAS ABLE TO MAKE MY WAY TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD, WITH VERY LIMITED VISIBILITY, AND PULL OFF THE ROAD WITHOUT ACCIDENT.  WHEN I TOOK THE VEHICLE FOR SERVICE THE FOLLOWING DAY I WAS TOLD THAT CHEVROLET WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT NO RECALL HAD BEEN DONE TO ADDRESS IT.  THE CIRCUIT BOARD FOR THE WIPERS NEEDED REPLACED.  THE WIPER FAILURE HAD OCCURED TWO OTHER TIMES IN THE PAST, BUT I WAS PARKED AT THOSE TIMES AND IN NO DANGER OF AN ACCIDENT.*AK",
