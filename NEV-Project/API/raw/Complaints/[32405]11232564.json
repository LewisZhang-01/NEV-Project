AFTER NUMEROUS RETURNS TO THE DEALER, TWICE FOR CLUTCH KIT REPLACEMENTS AND AT LEAST 5-6 TIMES FOR OTHER \"ADJUSTMENTS\" IT STILL HAS PROBLEMS.  JERKING, HESITATION, LOSS OF POWER EVEN WHILE DRIVING.  I PULLED OUT OF A SHOPPING PLAZA THE OTHER DAY AND WAS ALMOST REAR ENDED BY ANOTHER CAR BECAUSE THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE FOR SEVERAL SECONDS.  THIS HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES.  MY CAR WILL FEEL LIKE IT'S DOWNSHIFTING AND DRAGGING, EVEN WHILE I'M DRIVING AT A STEADY SPEED.  IT JERKS AND SHUDDERS WHEN I ACCELERATE AT A STOP LIGHT OR STOP SIGN.  RPM DIAL OFTEN GOES ALL THE WAY TO 8 OR 9 UNTIL THE CAR FINALLY SHIFTS.  DEALER CAN NOT SEEM TO FIX THIS.  ALSO, AT TIMES WHEN MOVING AGAIN AFTER A STOP, THE CAR WILL FEEL LIKE IT'S \"BANGING\" UNDERNEATH.  HAVE ADDRESSED THIS WITH SERVICE AT THE DEALER, BUT IT STILL DOES IT. THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING CONSTANTLY FOR THE TWO PLUS YEARS I'VE HAD IT.  I HAVE MANY DOCUMENTS AND REPAIR RECEIPTS TO DOWNLOAD, PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHEN AND IF YOU WILL NEED THEM.",
