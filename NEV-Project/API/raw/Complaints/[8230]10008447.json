THIS IS THE ABS KICKING IN.  DEALER SAYS I'M NOT COVERED.  HAVE CONTACTED ISUZU BUT ONLY GET ANSWERING MACHINE.  READING ON AN ISUZU FORUM (NOT SPONSORED BY ISUZU), THIS SEEMS TO BE A KNOWN AND COMMON PROBLEM WITH RODEO'S THAT ISUZU DOESN'T WANT TO ADDRESS IF YOUR OUT OF WARRANTY.  MY 99 HAS 29,000 MILES ON IT BUT IT IS OVER 3 YEARS.  I BOUGHT IT NEW. *JB",
