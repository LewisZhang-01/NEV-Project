        "summary": "RIDING TO WORK I NOTICED THE SMELL OF GAS - I PARKED THE BIKE AND NOTICED A STEADY OF GASOLINE DRIPPING OUT FROM UNDER THE LEFT FRONT FAIRING (PLASTIC GAS TANK AND FUEL PUMP ARE BEHIND THE LEFT FAIRING).  I REMOVED THE VARIOUS FAIRING PARTS AND NOTICED POOLING OF GASOLINE IN THE RESERVOIR ON TOP OF THE FUEL PUMP FLANGE.      I DRIED OUT THE TOP OF THE FLANGE AND TURNED THE KEY BACK ON TO ENGAGE THE FUEL PUMP AND DISCOVERED SEVERAL AREAS WHERE THE GASOLINE WAS SPRAYING FROM THE HIGH PRESSURE, 90 DEGREE GAS LINE BELOW THE BASE OF THE MALE CONNECTOR AND ONLY ON THE SHROUD OF THE FEMALE CONNECTION - BOTH THE 90 DEGREE MALE SIDE AND THE CONNECTING LINE WERE WHOLLY INTACT AND SEATED FULLY INTO THE CONNECTION.  I DISCONNECTED THE LINE AND REMOVED THE MALE CONNECTOR AND DISCOVERED MULTIPLE CRACKS AROUND THE SURFACE OF THE FEMALE RECEPTOR THAT PASSED INTO THE THREADED AREA OF THE FLANGE (WHICH ALLOWED GAS TO SPRAY OUT WHEN IT WAS UNDER PRESSURE).      THE BIKE IS BACK HOME AND INOPERABLE NOW - THE BIKE AS MENTIONED ABOVE, IS A 2007 BMW R1200RT WITH JUST OVER 21,000 MILES ON IT.  *TR",
