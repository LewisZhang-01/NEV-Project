NOT ONLY HAS THE RECALL NOT BEEN ADDRESSED BUT THE INDICATOR THAT TURNS THE AIRBAG ON AND OFF OF THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT IS BROKEN AND IN THE ON POSITION WHICH ENDANGERS EVERYONE IN THE AUTOMOBILE NOT JUST THE FRONT SEAT PASSENGER. ALL SEATS ARE NEEDED. THIS IS OUR ONLY VEHICLE FOR OUR DAUGHTER. IT IS AN EMERGENCY TO HAVE A SAFE VEHICLE TO USE. OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND DAUGHTER'S LIFE DEPENDS ON IT. WE HAVE CALLED NUMEROUS TIMES, CONTACTED BOTH THE DEALERSHIP AND THE MANUFACTURER AND TO NO AVAIL. THEIR ONLY RESPONSE IS THAT THE PARTS ARE NOT YET AVAILABLE AND THERE ARE A LOT OF VEHICLES INVOLVED IN THE RECALL. THAT DOES NOT HELP US. WE NEED A SAFE VEHICLE!!!!",
