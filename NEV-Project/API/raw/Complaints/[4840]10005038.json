HAD IT CHECKED OUT, IT IS THE BLOWER MOTOR. IT IS DRAWING TOO MUCH POWER AND OVERLOADING THE RESISTOR, WHICH IT NOW ALSO NEEDS.    I HAVE BEEN SCOURING THE WEB FOR REPORTS OF THIS HAPPENING TO PLYMOUTH BREEZES OR DODGE STRATUSES (STRASTI?) OR EVEN THE CIRRUS. I HAVE FOUND ABOUT 3 OR SO. NOT ENOUGH TO BE CLEAR EVIDENCE OF A RECURRING PROBLEM FOR OWNERS,  AND THE MANUFACTURER HAS NO RECALL ON THE PARTS.    MY QUESTION IS, HAVE YOU HAD OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS? I DID SEE SOME STUFF ABOUT A MILDEW SMELL IN THE CAR AND PROBLEMS WITH THE DEFOGGER NOT DEFOGGING ALL THE WAY. I BELIEVE THERE IS A CONNECTION WITH THIS AND THE BLOWER MOTOR ISSUE. MY CAR HAD THE SAME ISSUES WITH THE DEFOGGER BUT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO WARRANT A REPAIR.    PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE,    THANKS  JEFF GARRETT",
