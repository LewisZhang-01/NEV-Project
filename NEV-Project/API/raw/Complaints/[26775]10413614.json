        "summary": "TIRE VALVE FAILURE IN JEEP WRANGLERS.  THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE ACROSS THE ONLINE CHAT BOARDS.  I OWN A 3 YEAR OLD JEEP WRANGLER AND THE TIRE VALVE CRUMBLED IN MY HANDS WHEN TRYING TO INFLATE THE TIRE TO CORRECT PRESSURE.  APPARENTLY THE METAL USED IN THE TIRE VALVE DEGRADES EASILY AND EVEN THE DEALERSHIP IS WELL AWARE OF THIS CONSTANT REPAIR.  AFTER FAILURE OF THE TIRE VALVE, THE TIRE DEFLATES QUICKLY.  IT CAN START WITH A HAIRLINE CRACK DOWN THE VALVE STEM OR JUST BREAK OFF ACROSS THE VALVE BY THE TIRE RIM.  IT IS A TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE FAILURE AND CAN BE INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS IF IT FAILS AT THE WRONG TIME.  THE VALVE STEM IS HOOKED UP TO A TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM SO THE APPARATUS IS EXPENSIVE TO REPAIR.  THE REMEDY IS TOTAL REPLACEMENT OF EACH TIRES VALVE SYSTEM WITH AN EXACT REPLICA OF THE FIRST FAULTY PART.  THE FAILURE OF THIS ITEM IS CONCERNING AND SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED.  *KB",
