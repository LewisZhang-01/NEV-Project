THE HOOD CAN BE OPENED WITHOUT ANY ACCESS TO THE INSIDE OF THE CAR. ONCE THE HOOD IS OPENED, 2 BOLTS ARE ALL THAT ATTACH THE HEADLIGHTS TO THE CAR. AN EYEWITNESS CLAIMS THE THIEVES HAD THE HEADLIGHTS REMOVED IN UNDER 2 MINUTES.   NISSAN UNDERSTANDS THE PROBLEM AND HAS DESIGNED SOME ATTACHMENTS TO PREVENT THE HOOD FROM BEING OPENED FROM THE EXTERIOR. THE KIT COSTS ~$350 TO INSTALL. *JB",
