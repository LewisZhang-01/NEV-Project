THEN GOING BACK HOME MAKING A TURN, BRAKES FAILED AGAIN TO ENGAGE. SEEMS THIS HAPPENED WHEN MAKING TURNS. BROUGHT TO THE MAZDA DEALER, TOLD THEM ABOUT ONGOING INVESTIGATION BY NHTSA ABOUT MAZDA CX9 2010-2011 BRAKE PROBLEMS. THEY DID A THOROUGH CHECK BUT COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM SO NOTHING WAS FIXED. IT MIGHT BE THE BRAKE BOOSTER. I'M AFRAID THIS MIGHT HAPPEN AGAIN, THEY SAID THERE WAS NO RECALL REGARDING BRAKES FOR 2011 MAZDA CX9. HOPE THAT NHTSA FORCES MAZDA TO MAKE A RECALL. MAZDA HAS TO FIX THIS DANGEROUS PROBLEM.  *TR",
