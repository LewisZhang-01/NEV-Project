SINCE THE TIME OF PURCHASE IN LATE 2001, THE CAR HAS BEEN IN SERVICE MANY TIMES FOR THE WINDOWS AND LOCKS NOT WORKING AMONG OTHER THINGS, AND HAS HAD THREE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW REGULATORS REPLACED.  EACH TIME I WAS TOLD A NEW REGULATOR WAS PUT IN.  WHEN I QUESTIONED THE QUALITY OF THE REGULATORS, THE DEALER TOLD ME MY COMPLAINT WAS WITH GM AND NOT THEM BECAUSE THEY GET THEIR PARTS FROM GM.  HOW CAN THE WINDOW REGULATORS BE \"BAD\" THREE TIMES IN LESS THAN A YEAR?  BESIDES THE WINDOWS, I'VE HAD PROBLEMS WITH AUTOMATIC LOCKS NOT WORKING AND THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR NOT CLOSING.  THE CAR IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY BUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE WARRENTY EXPIRES AND I NEED YET ANOTHER WINDOW REGULATOR?  I DO NOT QUALIFY FOR THE NJ USED CAR LEMON LAW BECAUSE THE PROBLEMS BEGAN THREE MONTHS BEYOND THE LIMITATION DATE, EVEN THOUGH I MET EVERY OTHER QUALIFICATION.",
