ONLY TO BE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND I CAN HEAR SOMETHING LIKE THE WINDOW IS DOWN YET IT'S NOT. ALL THE WINDOWS WHERE CLOSED AND THE AC WAS ON. THEN I SAW THE DOOR AJAR LIGHT IS ON FOR THAT DOOR. THE DOOR HAD COME  UNLATCHED  ENOUGH DROP TO CHANGE THROUGH. I BOUGHT THIS VAN AND LOVED IT NOW I AM SERIOUSLY RECONSIDERING EVER BUYING ONE AGAIN. MY SISTER HAS THE 2006 AND SHE HAS HAD IT HAPPEN WITH BOTH DOOR ONE EVEN COMING OPEN WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD GOING 40 MPH.  MY OTHER SISTER ALSO HAS AN ODYSSEY THE 2003 AND SHE HAS ALSO HAS SAFETY ISSUES WITH HER POWER DOOR.  I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS VEHICLE TO ANYONE WITH ALL OF THE PROBLEMS I HAVE HAD AND NOW I'M HEARING MORE PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS ISSUE.",
