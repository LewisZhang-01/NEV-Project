THE SEATS ARE DESIGNED TO LATCH WHEN THE VEHICLE'S BRAKES ARE SUDDENLY APPLIED AND/OR THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY COMES TO A STOP (AS PER THE OWNERS MANUAL).  IN MY CASE, MY VEHICLE WAS ALREADY AT A STOP AND THEREFORE THE SEAT NEVER LATCHED.  CONSEQUENTLY, THE SEAT CAME FORWARD AND THE HEAD REST STRUCK ME LIKE A TWO BY FOUR.  MY INJURIES WERE MORE SEVERE BECAUSE OF THIS SECONDARY IMPACT FROM THE HEAD REST.  MY HUSBAND HAS A 1996 CHEVROLET CHEYENNE PICK-UP TRUCK THAT HAS THE SAME SEAT DESIGN.  IN ADDITION, IN BOTH VEHICLES EVEN WHEN THE BRAKES ARE APPLIED, THE SEATS BACKS STILL COME FORWARD SEVERAL INCHES BEFORE EVENTUALLY LOCKING.  *JB",
