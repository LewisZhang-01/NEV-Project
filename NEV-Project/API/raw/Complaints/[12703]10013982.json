        "summary": "WE TOOK OUR 96 WINDSTAR INTO THE FORD DEALER TO INVESTIGATE AN OIL LEAK.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT INFORMED MY WIFE THAT THE OIL PAN GASKET AND LIP SEAL, TIMING COVER GASKET, UPPER/LOWER INTAKE GASKETS AND U/C GASKETS NEEDED REPLACEMENT AT A COST OF $1,800.00.  I FOUND THIS UNUSUAL AND RESEARCHED THESE SYMPTOMS ON THE INTERNET AND WAS ASTONISHED WHAT I FOUND.  THE CONTENT IN THE ARTICLES ON MANY WEB SITES RESEARCHED, ARE IDENTICAL TO WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING.  FOLLOWING THE PATTERN OF THESE STORIES I AM CONCERNED THAT IF THE DEALER BEGINS THE WORK STATED, I WILL RECEIVE A CALL FROM HIM SAYING THAT COOLANT LEAKED PASSED THE GASKETS AND I WILL NEED A NEW ENGINE.  I ALSO DISCOVERED THAT FORD EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON 95 WINDSTARS.  THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT FORD IS PLANNING ON EXTENDING THE WARRANTY FOR THE 96 YEAR HOWEVER, THE INFORMATION THAT IS PUBLIC DOMAIN CLEARLY INDICATES A CHRONIC PROBLEM.  IT IS MY OPINION THAT I SHOULD NOT BEAR THESE COSTS, GIVEN THE HISTORIC PROBLEMS, AND HOPE THAT FORD WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE.  *JB",
