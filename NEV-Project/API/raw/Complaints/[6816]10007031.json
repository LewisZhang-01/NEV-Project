        "summary": "I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE FROM MY UNCLE WHEN IT  WAS 3 YEARS OLD WITH 40,000 MILES ON IT. IT BEGAN STALLING A YEAR OR SO AFTER I BOUGHT IT.  I HAD IT IN TO BOTH A FORD AND INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOP WITH A VARIETY OF REASONS GIVEN FOR IT STALLING.  I REPLACED THE IGNITION MODULE THREE DIFFERENT TIMES ON MY OWN ON A HUNCH THAT IT MIGHT BE THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE MOTH BALLED THE CAR FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS BECAUSE I WAS TIRED OF DRIVING AROUND HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT IT STOPPING ON ME.  I DIDN'T SELL IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO PAWN THE PROBLEM, OFF ON SOMEONE ELSE AND BESIDES I REALLY LIKED THE CAR OTHERWISE.  AFTER HEARING OF THE CALIFORNIA RECALL ORDER, EVERYTHING FELL INTO PLACE.  I BELIEVE THAT THE POOR ENGINEERING ON PLACEMENT OF THE IGNITION MODULE ON THE VEHICLE IS THE PROBLEM.  BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  I  FEEL TRAPPED BUT I AM HOPING THAT THE RECALL WILL EVENTUALLY IMPACT ME IN MINNESOTA.  THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP YOU CAN GIVE ME.  SINCERELY, JOHN HELLAND.  *AK  *SCC          **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*734334",
