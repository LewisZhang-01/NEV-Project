IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.  THEIR IS NO NOTICE PRIOR TO THE FAILURE AND NO SET OF DUPLICATING CONDITIONS WHICH INITIATE THE PROBLEM.  THIS WOULD APPEAR TO BE CHEVROLET DESIGN FLAW.  I FOUND OUT THAT THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE COBALT SERIES OF VEHICLES AND SAW MANY INTERNET RELATED SITES ONE OF WHICH DIRECTED ME HERE.  I BELIEVE CHEVY IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND WILL NOT REMEDY THE SITUATION UNTIL PROMPTED BY A MAJOR LAWSUIT FROM A DEATH OR THE INTERVENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  AT THE COST FOR A REPLACEMENT IT WILL BE A BUYING DECISION FOR MOST CONSUMERS AS THE PROBLEM CONTINUES TO BE INTERMITTENT. *TR",
