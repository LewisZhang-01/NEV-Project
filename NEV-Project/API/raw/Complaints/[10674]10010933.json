AFTER SHOVELING IT OUT, I FORGOT TO RELEASE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE BEFORE PUTTING IT INTO GEAR, NOW THEY ARE TELLING ME THE ENTIRE REAR BRAKE SYSTEM IS BLOWN AND IT WILL COST $1200.00 TO FIX.  CHERRY CREEK DODGE HAS THE TRUCK, THEY TELL ME THIS IS NORMAL FOR THIS VEHICLE AND THEY HAVE SEVERAL OTHERS IN THE SHOP WITH THIS PROBLEM NOW.  IT SEEMS LIKE A MANUFACTURER DEFECT FOR SOMETHING LITTLE LIKE THIS TO CAUSE SO MUCH DAMAGE TO AN EXPENSIVE VEHICLE.  I WANT AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS PROBLEM, IT SOUNDS LIKE I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE THE REPAIR SHOPS ARE MILKING LOTS OF MONEY FROM. *JB",
