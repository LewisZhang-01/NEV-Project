SHORTLY THERE AFTER THE VEHICLES BATTERY WENT DEAD.  TOOK IT TO NISSAN, THEY REPLACED IT, AND CHARGED US FOR THE BATTERY.  APPROXIMATELY 6 MONTHS LATER WE GOT LOSS OF POWER AGAIN FOLLOWED BY BRAKE AND BATTERY LIGHT COMING ON THEN CAR DIED.  AFTER RESEARCH I SEE THERE WAS A TSB BUT NO ONE AT THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME ABOUT IT EVEN AFTER I HAD ASKED THEM IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY TSBS ISSUED SINCE THIS WAS THE FIRST YEAR OF THE VEHICLES EXSISTANCE.  MY WIFE WAS DRIVING THE CAR WHEN THE LOSS OF POWER OCCURRED AND THANK GOD SHE WAS NOT HIT!!!!!  *AK",
