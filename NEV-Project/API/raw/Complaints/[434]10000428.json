WHEN I PRODUCED ALL MY OIL CHANGES I WAS TOLD I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.  CHRYSLER OFFERED 50/50 WHICH STILL HAS COST ME $3600+ TO REPLACE MY ENGINE.  I HAD TAKEN MY CAR IN WHEN IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY FOR \"TICKING NOISES UNDER THE HOODS\".  THEY RECENTERED THE TRANSMISSION AND MOTOR MOUNTS, REPLACED THE IDLER PULLEY, BUT IT STILL EXISTED.  THEY CLAIM I COULD NOT HAVE DRIVEN MY CAR FOR 3 YEARS WITH THIS PROBLEM.  THE #6 BERING FINALLY BLEW OUT.  VERY UPSETTING.  I WAS DRIVING THE CAR WHEN IT HAPPENED.",
