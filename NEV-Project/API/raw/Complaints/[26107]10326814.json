        "summary": "INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)    I WAS DRIVING EAST ON INTERSTATE 95 WHEN THE ENGINE IN MY CAR (2007 VW GTI VIN: [XXX]) SUDDENLY LOST ALL POWER. I WAS IN THE THIRD LANE DRIVING AT APPROXIMATELY 70 MPH, TURNED THE AIR CONDITIONING ON AND A FEW SECONDS LATER, TURNED IT OFF. AT THAT INSTANT, THE CAR CEASED TO ACCELERATE. I PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL, TURNED ON MY HAZARD LIGHTS AND MANAGED TO SAFELY GLIDE OVER TO THE WARNING LANE, JUST BEYOND EXIT 22 OR JUST BEYOND THE OFF RAMP TO EXIT 21. I TRIED TO RESTART THE ENGINE TO NO AVAIL. THIS WAS A HIGHLY ALARMING INCIDENT SINCE THE CAR WAS JUST OVER THREE YEARS OLD AND HAD ONLY 64000 MILES ON IT AND WAS PROPERLY MAINTAINED SINCE I PURCHASED IT NEW IN 2007. I HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS LAST YEAR BUT THE ACCELERATION OF THE CAR WOULD QUICKLY KICK BACK IN. THIS TIME HOWEVER, IT WENT COMPLETELY KAPUT. I REPORTED THE PREVIOUS INCIDENTS TO A VW DEALER AND THEY HAD A TERRIBLE TIME ASCERTAINING WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. ULTIMATELY, THEY DETERMINED IT WAS A FUEL SENSOR ISSUE AND REPLACED THE FUEL SENSOR. AFTER THE APRIL 3RD INCIDENT, MY CAR WAS TOWED TO A VW DEALER WHERE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT MY TIMING BELT HAD BROKEN AND THAT AS A RESULT, THERE WAS DAMAGE DONE TO THE ENGINE TO THE TUNE OF APPROXIMATELY 6K. I WANT TO REPORT THIS SINCE THIS COULD EASILY HAVE OCCURRED IN THE HOLLAND TUNNEL FOR EXAMPLE OR ON A DARK ONE LANE ROAD. IT WAS A VERY SCARY EXPERIENCE AND I FEEL THAT THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PREEMPT THIS FROM EVER HAPPENING. *TR",
