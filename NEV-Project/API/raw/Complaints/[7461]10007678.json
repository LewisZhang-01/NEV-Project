        "summary": "MY WIFE WAS DRIVING OUR 97 CHEVY ASTRO VAN ABOUT 40MPH WHEN SHE ATTEMPTED TO STOP. THE VAN WAS NOT STOPPING SO SHE PUSHED THE BRAKE PEDAL AS HARD AS SHE COULD. JUST AS IT WAS ABOUT TO STOP AT THE STOP SIGN IT LURCHED FORWARD INTO THE INTERSECTION. THE VAN CONTINUED THROUGH THE INTERSECTION AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED (LUCKILY THERE WAS NO OTHER CARS COMING). SHE TRIED TO STOP AGAIN NOW NOTICING THAT THE ENGINE WAS RACING. SHE TURNED OFF THE CAR AND PUT IT INTO PARK. WE THEN HAD THE VAN TOWED TO THE DEALER WE BOUGHT IT AT. THEY LOOKED AT IT AND SAID THE FUEL PRESSURE REGULATOR WENT OUT AND WAS POURING RAW FUEL INTO THE MOTOR. IT WAS OCCURING AT SUCH A HIGH RATE THAT IT SUCKED A PART OF THE THROTTLE BODY INTO THE MOTOR. WE STILL DON'T HAVE OUR VAN BACK OR DO WE KNOW THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGES (THEY HAVE TO PULL THE HEADS OFF TO FIND THE PART THAT GOT SUCKED IN).        I AM GLAD I AM WRITING THIS JUST WORRYING ABOUT A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS I AM OUT AND NOT TELLING YOU HOW MY WIFE AND TWO KIDS WERE KILLED. I CALLD GENERAL MOTORS TO COMPLAIN AND THEY MADE A CASE (#1-73278300) AND SAID THAT IF THEY GOT ENOUGH COMPLAINTS THIS COULD TURN INTO A RECALL AT WHICH TIME THEY WOULD REIMBURSE US. THE SERVICE MANAGER AT THE DEALER SAID HE HAS SEEN CASES IN WHICH PARTS WERE SUCKE INTO THE ENGINE 3 OR 4 TIMES. MY QUESTION IS HOW MANY PEOPLE NEED TO GET HURT OR KILLED FOR GM TO THINK THIS IS A SAFETY PROBLEM? MY FAMILY GOT LUCKY IN THAT THEY WERE JUST ON A RESIDENTIAL STREET, BUT AS YOU CAN SEE IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE. ALSO I DON'T THINK I SHOULD HAVE TO BE LIABLE FOR MY WHOLE ENGINE BEING IN JEOPARDY FROM ONE RELATIVELY CHEAP PART GOING BAD. I AM COMPAINING ABOUT A POTENTIAL DEADLY PROBLEM THAT I FEEL IS A DESIGN FLAW. HOW MANY OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME AS MY FAMILY OR WORSE? HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE FOR GM TO RECOGNISE THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM?",
