ONCE CAR TURNED OFF AND TURNED BACK ON THE FAULT CLEARED AND THE ENGINE RAN SMOOTH. TOOK THE CAR TO THE FORD STORE SAN LEANDRO (CA). LIKE THE SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ON THIS WEBSITE THEY COULD NOT FIND RECORD ON THE CAR'S COMPUTER AND COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  THEREFORE I GO AWAY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MY SAFETY AND FUTURE OCCURRENCES OF THE SAME EVENT. FROM THIS WEBSITE I SEE LOTS OF COMPLAINTS.  WHEN WILL FORD DO SOMETHING TO RECTIFY.
