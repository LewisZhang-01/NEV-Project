I WAS AFRAID IT WOULD NOT STOP AND WOULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. I TOOK IT TO THE CHEVROLET DEALER IN WALDORF MD. THE MECHANIC SAID HE COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT AND COULD NOT MAKE IT DO IT. THAT WAS 2 MONTHS AGO AND IT STILL DOES IT ALL THE TIME. SOUNDS LIKE ALL THESE OTHER SIMILAR COMPLAINTS FOR THIS VEHICLE.. DEFECTIVE WARPED ROTORS. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AND I CANNOT GET A DEALERSHIP TO FIX IT.    *NLM",
