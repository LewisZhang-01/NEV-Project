THE CHEST BAR IS DEFECTIVE AND MY 20 MONTH OLD CHILD CAN PULL ON THE BAR AND GET OUT.  IT IS NOT A MATTER OF HER SLIDING THE BAR DOWN IT IS JUST BY HER PULLING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT.  WHEN I CALLED THE COMPANY TO COMPLAIN THEY SUGGESTED I PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL PART THEY MAKE FOR THIS SEAT.  SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THERE IS A PROBLEM.    *NLM",
