ESPECIALLY ABOUT SHIFTING FROM 1ST INTO 2ND AND A GRINDING CLUTCH ON AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION?? THE ONLY PROBLEM I'LL GRANT IS THE WATER IN THE PASSENGER FLOORBOARD AND THAT HAPPENED ON MY '91 AS WELL. SO WHAT, IT'S A JEEP FER PETE'S SAKE.  AND IF YOU'VE ALMOST HAD AN ACCIDENT WHEN THE GEARSHIFT POPS OUT IN 1ST... STOP PULLING OUT IN FRONT OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. PROBLEM SOLVED. MY GUT FEELING IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO PROPERLY DRIVE A STCIK SHIFT AND THEY'RE DRIVING A JEEP LIKE A SPORTS CAR. I HATE TO RAG ON OTHER JEEP DRIVERS BUT I'VE SEEN THEM DO IT. STOP WHINING PLEASE.",
