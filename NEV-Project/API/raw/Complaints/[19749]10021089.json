AT ABOUT 38000 MILES NOTICED A VIOLENT VIBRATION WHEN BRAKING AT HI SPEED AND A LOUD CLUNK WHEN BRAKES APPLIED. DEALER SAID NO WARRANTY NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR. DEALER ADVISED ME TO GET THE ROTORS TURNED WHEN THE BRAKE PADS WEAR OUT AT AROUND 80000 TO 90000 MILES. THEY SAID THE CLUNKING SOUND IS NORMAL WHEN THE ROTORS ARE WARPED. DEALER SAID WARRNTY DOES NOT COVER ROUTINE MAINTENANCE. DEFECTIVE BRAKE AT 38000 HIGHWAY MILES IS NOT ROUTINE IN MY OPINION. LAST TIME I WILL OWN A MAZDA.*AK",
