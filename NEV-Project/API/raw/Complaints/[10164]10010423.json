        "summary": "I WAS TOLD TO FILE A COMPLAINT, BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS IN THE LATE MODEL MAZDA 626'S. I JUST SPENT $1700 FOR A REBUILT TRANSMISSION ON MY 1999 626 ES WITH 62000 MILES. THE DAMAGE OF THE TRANSMISSION WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT. MY MECHANIC WHOM I HAVE KNOWN FOR 7 YEARS SAID THIS NOT AN ISOLATED PROBLEM WITH THESE CARS, HE SAID JUST IN FEBRUARY ALONE HE DID 4. HE SAID THESE TRANSMISSIONS ARE JUNK, AND VERY EXPENSIVE TO REPAIR BECAUSE OF THEIR DESIGN. THIS DESIGN DOES NOT HAVE A PAN ON THE BOTTOM SO YOU CAN CHECK THE VITALS, IT IS ON THE SIDE. HE SAID THIS DESIGN OF AUTOMATIC WAS PUT INTO THE 626, MX-6 , AND THE FORD PROBE. IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME ANYTIME.   JOHN.     *JB",
