I NOTICED COOLANT ON THE STREET.  I TOWED THE VAN TO A DODGE SERVICE CENTER.   THEY DIAGNOSED THAT MY WATER PUMP BEARING HAD BROKEN.   THE TIMING BELT DRIVES THE WATER PUMP ON THIS VEHICLE.  ONCE THE BEARING BROKE, IT LOOSENED AND ULTIMATELY BROKE THE TIMING BELT WHICH I HAD REPLACED A YEAR BEFORE.  I HAD TO PAY $990.00 FOR THIS REPAIR, WHICH WAS UNEXPECTED.  THE FAULTY BEARING WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ME PAYING FOR A NEW WATER PUMP, TIMING BELT, THEROMOSTAT, AND OTHER PARTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING BELT ASSEMBLY.  SINCE THE WATER PUMP AND ITS BEARING ARE INSIDE THE TIMING BELT ASSEMBLY, I WAS NOT ABLE TO HEAR OR SEE ANYTHING THAT WOULD INDICATE THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE VAN.   MY VAN HAD 77,000 MILES ON IT WHEN THIS WATER PUMP BEARING FAILED.",
