THEN IT WAS THE ROTTEN EGG SMELL, THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG.(THEN WHY DOES MY CAR STINK WHEN I TRY TO GET POWER OUT OF THE ENGINE?) THEN IT WAS THE KNOCKING AND PINGING IN THE ENGINE, (I WAS TOLD THAT THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM, BUT MY OCTANE LEVEL WAS LOW TO UPGRADE MY GAS. THE MANUFACTURERS PROVIDED OWNERS MANUAL STATES 87 OCTANE GAS OR HIGHER, I ALREADY USE 89 OCTANE AND HAVE SINCE THE DAY I BOUGHT THE CAR, SO WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO SPEND MONEY ON HIGHER PRICED GAS WHEN THE CAR IS ONLY 1 YEAR OLD AND THE ENGINE SHOULD NOT MAKE ANY NOISES. NOW IT IS THE TIRES AND ALIGNMENT THE ALIGNMENT IS COMPLETELY OFF THAT THE TIRES ARE DESTROYED WITH ONLY 17,250 MILES ON THEM, YET THE CAR SHOWS NO SIGN OF THE ALIGNMENT BEING OFF, IT DRIVES STRAIGHT STAYS IN ONE LANE AND THE STEERING WHEEL IS EVEN STRAIGHT, SO HOW AFTER ONE YEAR WITH LOW MILES IS THE ALIGNMENT OFF AND THE TIRES ARE DESTROYED, AND WHY WAS IT UNNOTICED WHEN I HAD MY TIRES BALANCED AND ROTATED 2 MONTHS EARLIER AT 15,000 MILES? BY THE SAME DEALERSHIP! I FEEL THAT THIS CAR HAS ALOT OF PROBLEMS THAT THE MANUFACTURER DOES NOT WANT TO ADDRESS, LOOK AT HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS, AND WE ARE ALL TOLD THAT IT IS WEAR AND TEAR OR THAT THERE IS NO PROBLEM AT ALL, WELL THEN WHY ARE WE ALL HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS? I CALLED TOYOTA'S MAIN OFFICE LOGGED A COMPLAINT AND WAS TOLD THAT SOMEONE WOULD GET BACK TO ME, IT HAS BEEN 3 DAYS NOW AND NOT ONE CALL HAS COME MY WAY! I FEEL THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS TO THIS CAR SINCE IT IS A NATION WIDE PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT IS A $27000.00 CAR THAT HAS DEPRECIATED IN VALUE BY MORE THAN $7000.00 IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR, WHAT HAPPENED TO TOYOTA'S RETAINING THERE VALUE? I WISH EVERYBODY MUCH LUCK WITH THEIR ISSUES.   *NLM",
