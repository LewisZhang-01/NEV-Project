FORCED TO SLAM ON BRAKES ON HIGHWAY TO STOP VIOLENT SHAKING AND REGAIN CONTROL OF VEHICLE.  IT STARTED A COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND HAPPENS ANY TIME I HIT A BIG BUMP.  IT HAPPENED 3 TIMES YESTERDAY.  I GOOGLED THIS AND IT APPEARS THIS IS A RATHER COMMON COMPLAINT - ONE THAT SEEMS TO BE PARTICULARLY COMMON IN THE NEWER STYLE JEEPS AT AROUND 20,000-30,000 MILES EVEN WHEN NO MODIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE.  THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AND IF ITS THIS COMMON, CHRYSLER SHOULD BE FORCED TO ADDRESS THIS!  *TR",
