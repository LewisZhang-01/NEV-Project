        "summary": "TRUCK HAS A 36 GALLON GAS TANK. FUEL GAUGE DOES NOT GO TO FULL WHEN FILLED. WHILE DRIVING FUEL GAUGE GOES TO EMPTY AND MESSAGE CENTER COMES ON LOW FUEL 10 MILES TO EMPTY. TANK STILL HAS 20 GALLONS OR MORE IN TANK. WHEN FILLING WITH GAS AFTER THIS HAPPENS THERE IS A HIGH PRESSURE RELEASE OF GAS FUMES FROM THE FILLER NECK WHEN PUMP NOZZLE IS PLACED IN THE NECK. AN AUDIBLE WHOOSH SOUND IS MADE AND THE BUILD UP OF GAS FUMES IS CONSISTENT WITH EVERY TIME THE GAUGE AND MESSAGE CENTER THINK THE TANK IS EMPTY. WHEN STARTING THE TRUCK AFTER THIS OCCURRENCE IT TAKES 2-3 TRIES BEFORE THE ENGINE WILL START. THE ENGINE MALFUNCTION INDICATOR LAMP WILL COME ON FOR 3-20 MINUTES BEFORE GOING OFF. THE FORD VEHICLE HEALTH REPORT READS \"ENGINE, TRANSMISSION, AMP; EMISSIONS. THE TRUCK HAS BEEN SERVICED 8 TIMES WITH NO CORRECTIVE RESULTS. MY MAJOR CONCERN IS THE BUILD UP OF FUMES AND THE POSSIBILITY OF FIRE. IT APPEARS THAT FORD HAS KNOWN OF THIS PROBLEM WITH TRUCKS HAVING 36 GALLON TANKS SINCE 2008 BASED ON COMMENTS FROM OTHER OWNERS WHEN I GOOGLED MY PROBLEM. TO THIS DATE FORD DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.  *TR",
