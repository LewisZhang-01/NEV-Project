THE DEALERS HAVE SAID I WAS THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM BUT AFTER SEEING THIS WEB SITE I SEE THAT IS NOT TRUE. ALSO I HAD THE BEARINGS GO OUT IN THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL ALMOST LEADING TO THE TIRE FALLING OFF IF MY WIFE HAD NOT NOTICED IT IN TIME. THE ROTORS HAVE BEEN REPLACED TWICE HAVE BEEN TURNED AT LEAST EVERY 15,000 MILES SINCE NEW I HAVE AROUND 80,000 MILES NOW. THE DEALER DID THE BRAKES THREE TIMES UNTIL THE WARRNTY RAN OUT AT 36,000 MILES I HAVE HAD THEM FIXED MYSELF SINCE THEN. THIS TRUCK IS SAID TO BE HEAVY DUTY AND I ONLY TOW A CAMPER WITH IT TWICE A YEAR 60 MILE ROUND TRIP I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD NOT BE HAVING THIS KIND OF PROBLEM. THE SEVERE SHAKING THAT IS CAUSED BY THIS MAKES IF DIFFICULT TO DRIVE FOR MY WIFE SINCE SHE IS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THE CAR. I CANNOT WAIT TILL MY LEASE RUNS OUT SO I CAN GET RID OF THIS CAR. THE DEALERS WILL NOT HELP ME AT ALL. THANK FOR AND HELP YOU MIGHT CAN GIVE                                        WILLIAM ANDREWS",
