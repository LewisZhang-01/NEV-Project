I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ALSO CAUSING AN INCREASE IN THE TIME REQUIRED TO STOP THE VEHICLE.  I HAVE HAD TO HAVE MY ROTORS TURNED TWICE, THE FIRST TIME AT 30,016 MILES AND JUST RECENTLY AT 52,400 MILES.  THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT HE IS SEEING THIS WITH LOTS OF 1999 TAURUS VEHICLES, AND HE BELIEVES THERE IS A DESIGN PROBLEM.   *JB",
