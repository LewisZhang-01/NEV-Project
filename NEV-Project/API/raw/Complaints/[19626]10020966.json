        "summary": "THE FIRST TIME THE CAR JUST QUITE ON THE HIGHWAY WHILE DRIVING IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC WHILE WE WERE ON VACATION. THE SECOND TIME IT LOST POWER AND WAS STARTING VERY HARD (10 TO 15 SEC. TO START). BOTH TIMES IT WAS LOSS OF FUEL PRESSURE AND NEEDED A FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY. THE FUEL PUMP ITS SELF WAS FINE, BUT A SMALL CLEAR FLEXIBLE HOSE THAT ATTACHES FROM THE FUEL PUMP/BASKET ASSEMBLY IN THE GAS TANK TO THE LID THAT BOLTS ON THE TOP OF THE GAS TANK RUBS AGAINST VARIOUS PARTS INSIDE THE GAS TANK AND WEARS A HOLE IN IT. SINCE THIS ESTIMATED $2 ITEM CANNOT BE PURCHASED SEPARATELY I WAS FORCED TO SPEND HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON THE WHOLE ASSEMBLY. THE MECHANICS AT THE DEALERSHIP EXPLAINED TO ME THAT 90% OF THE \"FUEL PUMP FAILURES\" HAVE HAD NOTHING TO REALLY DUE WITH THE FUEL PUMP. IT WAS EITHER THE HOSE INSIDE THE GAS TANK RUBBING THROUGH OR THE WIRES INSIDE RUBBING THROUGH. WHY IS THERE NO RECALL FOR THIS? I WOULD ASK FOR A PUSH FOR THE HOSES BUT IF THE WIRING IN THE GAS TANK IS WEARING THROUGH ALSO IT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED IF THEY HAVE NOT YET!  *NLM",
