THIS COULD BE TEMPORARILY CORRECTED BY MANUALLY RE-SELECTING D, BUT IN ABOUT 3 SECONDS, IT SHIFTED BACK TO N.  WE DROVE BY KEEPING ONE HAND ON THE LEVER TO KEEP IT IN D.  AFTER WE STOPPED, THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED IN REVERSE (R) -- THE SELECTOR SHIFTED INTO N AFTER A COUPLE OF SECONDS.  AGAIN, WE WERE ABLE TO MOVE THE VEHICLE BY MAINTAINING PRESSURE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE R SELECTION.      I'VE FOUND SEVERAL REFERENCES TO THIS PROBLEM ON WEBSITES.  IT APPEARS TO BE SOLVED BY INSTALLING A NEW SELECTOR ASSEMBLY.   *TR",
