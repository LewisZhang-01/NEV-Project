THOUGH THERE IS A TSB ISSUED, DEALER WOULD NOT FIX UNLESS ISSUE IS REPLICATED DESPITE SHOWING THEM WHAT MY CAR DID ON VIDEO. MOST NOTICEABLE AFTER CAR WAS RUN FOR A VERY BRIEF TIME HOURS BEFORE.   ALSO NOTICE THE LAST FEW WEEKS, WHILE DRIVING VEHICLE, UPON ICE STARTING UP, THE ENGINE IS ROUGH AND THE SHIFT TO ICE IS NOTICEABLE. PREVIOUSLY IT WAS SMOOTH. NO CODES HAVE APPEARED AND THE CAR APPEARS TO RUN NORMAL OTHERWISE.   I WOULD LIKE THE DEALER TO FIX THE PROBLEM AS DESCRIBED IN 2 SEPARATE TSBS (ENGINE MOUNTS AND INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET).  *TR",
