NOW THAT MAY SEEM TRIVIAL, BUT THEY DO SO WITHOUT WARNING DUE TO EXTREMELY BAD DESIGN/ENGINEERING.  THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO FAIL.  TO REPLACE THEM I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT EACH KEY WOULD COST $67 AND THE PROGRAMMING ANOTHER $88.  WITHOUT THE CASE BEING ATTACHED TO THE KEY, THE IGNITION WILL NOT OPERATE.  IF SOMEONE WERE SOMEWHERE IN THE COUNTRY ALONG WAY FROM CIVILIZATION, WHAT WOULD ONE DO?  THIS IS WHY I AM COMPLAINING,  AND WHY THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  THE PRICE FOR REPLACEMENT IS ALSO OUTRAGEOUS.  *TR",
