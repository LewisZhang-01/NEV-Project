        "summary": "2002 FORD EXPLORER CAN SLIP FROM PARK INTO REVERSE, CAUSING A ROLL-AWAY ACCIDENT.  THE GEAR SHIFT IS LOOSE ENOUGH THAT A DRIVER CAN SHIFT THE TRUCK INTO \"P\" ON THE GEAR SHIFT, BUT THE TRUCK IS NOT ACTUALLY ALL THE WAY IN PARK.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS, IT CAN SLIDE INTO REVERSE.    THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER.  SHE PUT THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND BACKED UP THE DRIVEWAY.  SHE LEFT THE VEHICLE IN PARK ON THE LEVEL DRIVEWAY TO RUN A BAG OF GROCERIES INSIDE.  SHE OPENED THE REAR GATE, WENT INSIDE, DROPPED THEM OFF, THEN HEARD A LOUD CRASH.  THE TRUCK HAD SLIPPED OUT OF PARK AND INTO REVERSE, CAUSING IT TO CRASH INTO THE HOUSE.    I CAN REPRODUCE THIS BEHAVIOR EASILY.  I TOOK IT TO BOB TOMES FORD OF MCKINNEY, TX AND SPOKE WITH MAUREEN POLLACK OF FORD'S CONSUMER AFFAIRS.  THEY SAID THAT THEY COULD FIND NO DEFECT (OF COURSE).  I BELIEVE THAT THEY FOUND NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY BECAUSE ALL 2002 FORD EXPLORERS HAVE AMBIGUOUS GEAR SHIFTS.     I URGED HER TO HAVE FORD ISSUE A RECALL OR A SERVICE BULLETIN AT THE LEAST.  SHE DECLINED, SAYING THAT THE TECHNICIAN AT THE DEALERSHIP SAID IT WAS OK.",
