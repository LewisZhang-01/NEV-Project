THIS IS THE SECOND HYUNDAI I OWNED THAT HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM AND LOOKING THROUGH CARFAX ON USED VEHICLES THERE ARE NUMEROUS VEHICLES WITH REPEATED ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS.  THE VEHICLE CAN BE MOVING OR IN PARKED IN A GARAGE OVERNIGHT.  VEHICLE HAD ME LOCKED INSIDE SO LONG AT ONE POINT THAT I WAS LATE FOR A MEETING AND WAS ABOUT TO CRAWL OUT A WINDOW WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO USE A DOOR.  THIS IS A DEFINITE SAFETY ISSUE FOR ANY TYPE OF ACCIDENT.  RESCUE COULD NOT TAKE PLACE AS DOOR COULD NOT BE OPENED.  THIS IS AN ON GOING PROBLEM THAT HAS NOT BEEN SOLVED BY DEALERSHIP.",
