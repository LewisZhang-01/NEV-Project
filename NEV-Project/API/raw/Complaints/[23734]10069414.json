THE CAR WAS FINE UNTIL I ARRIVED AT HOME AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON AGAIN.  I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALER ON NOVEMBER 11TH AND THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE CAR.  THEY WERE GOING TO REMOVE THE TRANSMISSION BUT NEEDED A PART.  IT IS NOW NOVEMBER 25TH AND THE PART STILL HASN'T ARRIVED AND THE CAR HASN'T BEEN REPAIRED.",
