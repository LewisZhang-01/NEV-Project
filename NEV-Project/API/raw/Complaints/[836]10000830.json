LUCKILY THE CARS BEHIND ME WERE ABLE TO VEER AWAY, OTHERWISE IT WOULD'VE BEEN DISASTROUS.  FEW MINUTES AFTER THAT MY CAR LOST 5TH, 4TH AND 3RD GEAR, I HAD TO DRIVE HOME USING 2ND GEAR... WHEN I GOT HOME, I REALIZED THE CAR ALSO LOST REVERSE GEAR.    NOW I AM ON MY 2ND TRANSMISSION, AND SOMTIMES IT WOULD ALSO START SURGING A BIT DURING SHIFTING WHICH IS EARLY SIGN FOR ANOTHER TRANSMISSION FAILURE.  I AM JUST NERVOUS EVERYTIME I SIT IN THAT CAR.  ESPECIALLY AFTER I LEARNED THAT SO MANY PEOPLE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.",
