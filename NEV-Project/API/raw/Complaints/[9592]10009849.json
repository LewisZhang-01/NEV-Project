FINALLY THE EVO SENSOR WAS REPLACED.  ABS ALSO HAVE NEVER WORKED FELT GOOD, THE PEDAL GOES TO LOW BEFORE THE BRAKES SLOW THE VEHICLE DOWN.  THIS HAS BEEN A COMPLAINT SINCE THE TRUCK WAS NEW.  THE RETAILER SEEMS NOT VERY CONCERNED WITH MY COMPLAINTS.  ESPECIALLY KNOWING THAT I AM AN AUTOMOBILE TECHNICIAN THEY FEEL I WILL LET THE PROBLEM GO.  THEIR REPAIRS HAVE BEEN UNSATISFACTORY FROM THE BEGINNING.  I HAVE HAD TO COMPLAIN ABOUT PROBLEMS MANY TIMES BEFORE, FINALLY THE PROBLEMS ARE FIXED.  WITH THE STEERING PROBLEM I HAD TO CONTACT ANOTHER DEALER TECH I KNEW AND ASK HIM THE PROBLEM WHICH HE KNEW WHAT WAS WRONG IMMEDIATELY.  PLEASE DO SOMETHING BEFORE ALL THESE TRUCKS WITH THIS STEERING AND BRAKE PROBLEM.   *JB    ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****734335",
