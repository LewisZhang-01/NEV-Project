VEHICLE IS A 2015 FORD EXPLORER BASE MODEL. FORD DEALER IN ALEXANDRIA, VA (OURISMAN FORD) CHECKED VEHICLE WHEN SUV WAS UNDER 5000 MILES. TOLD US THAT IT IS NORMAL. VEHICLE HAS 36K MILES NOW AND STILL HAS THAT EXHAUST SMELL UNDER SAID DRIVING CONDITIONS. I WAS TOLD BY DEALER SERVICE ADVISER AT LAST OIL CHANGE THAT ONLY POLICE CARS HAVE THIS ISSUE. A QUICK SEARCH ON THE INTERNET AS WELL AS NHTSA STATES A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS FROM NON-POLICE CARS.    EXHAUST SOMETIMES SMELLS LIKE SULFUR (ROTTEN EGG) SMELL.",
