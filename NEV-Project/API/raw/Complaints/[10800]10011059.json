ALSO REALIZED THAT AC/HEATING SYSTEM HAD \"WHISTLE\" WHICH COULD NOT BE TURNED OFF.  MAJOR PROBLEM HAS VEHICLE STALLING WHILE DRIVING, LOSING ALL POWER, BRAKES, ETC.  FORTUNATE NOT TO HAVE BEEN REAR-ENDED.  FORD DEALER HAS WORKED ON PROBLEM, REPLACING TRANSMISSION, FIXING AC/HEAT SYSTEM AND ATTEMPTED TO REPAIR THE \"STALLING\" PROBLEM.  THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN REPAIRED, HOWEVER, IT HAPPENED AGAIN YESTERDAY.  CAR AT FORD DEALER ONCE AGAIN.  IT IS STRANGE TO ME THAT THEY DO NOT COMMENT THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED NOT ONCE BUT MANY HUNDRED TIMES!  I DEFINITELY FEEL THERE IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE ESCAPE STALLING AND BEING UNABLE TO CONTROL.  AS WE DRIVE ON MOUNTAIN ROADS, THIS COULD CAUSE A MAJOR ACCIDENT.  FORD HAS CERTAINLY LOST MY FUTURE BUSINESS BY NOT FACING THIS VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM.  MUST THERE BE FATALITIES BEFORE THEY ACT?  *JB",
