THIS HAPPENED A COUPLE MORE TIMES AND I NOTICED THE VEHICLE RUNNING A LITTLE ROUGH. WHEN I TOOK IT TO MY MECHANIC, HE DISCOVERED THE HEAD GASKET WAS LEAKING NEAR THE #6 CYLINDER. WHEN I CONTACTED TOYOTA, THEY EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THE HEAD GASKET \"RECALL\" DIDN'T APPLY TO ME BECAUSE MY VIN NUMBER WASN'T INCLUDED IN THE RECALL. IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE TOYOTA HAS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT THAT THEY ARE NOT BACKING UP.  *JB",
