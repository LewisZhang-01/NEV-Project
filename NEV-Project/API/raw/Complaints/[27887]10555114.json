THEY INSPECTED THE POWER STEERING SYSTEM AND THE INTERMEDIATE (LOWER) SHAFT WAS BINDING AND NEEDED REPLACEMENT.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE FORD RECALL FOR 2005-2011 FORD VEHICLES, I CAN NOT GET PARTS.  I CALLED FORD  AND WENT TO THE DRUM HILL DEALERSHIP IN LOWELL BUT SINCE THE 2004 MERCURY GRAND MARQUIS ARE NOT IN THE RECALL, I HAVE NO RECOURSE.  THIS IS THE SAME PART THAT NHTSA INVESTIGATED AND CALLED FOR A RECALL ON THE 2005-2011 FORD VEHICLES.  I BELIEVE THE 2004 VEHICLES SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL AS IT IS THE SAME PART IN THE POWER STEERING SHAFT THAT HAS FAILED IN THE 2004 THAT FAILS IN THE 2005-2011 MODELS.",
