A FEW DAYS LATER I WAS DRIVING AND THE ENGINE QUIT AGAIN AND THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. I CHECKED THE MANUAL AND IT SAID I COULD CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE CAR.  I TOOK THE CAR TO A REPAIR SHOP AND THEY CHECKED HE COMPUTER CODES AND SAID IT WAS A CAM SENSOR, A CRANK POSITION SENSOR OR A VARIABLE TIMING CONTROL SENSOR OR COMBINATION OR ALL THREE.  THEY THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS A RECALL ITEM. I SEARCHED AND DISCOVERED THAT INFINITI RECALL 3021 WAS ISSUED AS WELL AS RECALL 01V357.  THE DEALER SAID THAT MY CAR WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE RECALL.  THE CAR POSES A SAFETY ISSUE TO ME AND OTHER DRIVERS.  WHY ISN'T THIS COVERED BY RECALL?",
