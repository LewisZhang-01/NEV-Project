NEXT, THE WIPERS WOULD NOT TURN ON WHEN IT WAS REALLY COLD.  THE DEALERSHIP COULD NOT REPLICATE OR FIX THE PROBLEM.  NEXT, THE WIPERS COULD NOT REACH FULL SPEED.  AT 35,000 MILES, WE FORCED THE DEALERSHIP TO REPLACE THE MFS UNDER WARRANTY.  FINALLY, AT 59,000 MILES, WHITE SMOKE STARTED SPEWING FROM THE MFS.  AFTER CALLING THE DEALERSHIP, I HAD THE CAR TOWED AND THE MFS REPLACED.  WHEN I COMPLAINED, THE DEALERSHIP REFERRED ME TO THE FORD COMPLAINT LINE.  THEIR RESPONSE WAS UNACCEPTABLE",
