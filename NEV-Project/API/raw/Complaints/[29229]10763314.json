THIS HAD HAPPENED PRESVIOUSLY TO ME BUT CORRECTLY ITSELF SO I CONTINUED TO DRIVE. WHILE DRIVING MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ALSO CAME ON. EVENTUALLY THE TANK READ 1/2 FULL AND THE LOW GAS LIGHT TURNED OFF. HOWEVER  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS STILL ON. THIS IS NOT OK. I TAKE GREAT CARE OF MY VEHICLE AND SHOULD FEEL SAFE DRIVING IN IT WITH MY CHILDREN. I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH HYUNDAI.",
