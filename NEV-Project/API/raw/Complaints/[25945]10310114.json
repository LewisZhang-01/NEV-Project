AFTER RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM I SEE THAT THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS OF THIS OCCURRING WITH THIS SAME PARTICULAR MODEL. THE TRANSMISSION STARTS TO MAKE A GRINDING NOISE AND THEN WILL START SLIPPING. NISSAN IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONE THAT HAS DIAGNOSED IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN, BUT HAVE REFUSED TO ISSUE A TSB OR RECALL. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS DEFECT AND IS COSTING PEOPLE 5 TO 10 THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FIX. MY 2005 NISSAN PATHFINDER HAS JUST BEGUN THE TELL TALE SYMPTOMS OF THIS COSTLY PROBLEM. NISSAN SHOULD CONSIDER THE PROBLEMS THAT TOYOTA IS HAVING RIGHT NOW AND ISSUE A RECALL FOR THIS DEFECT. *TR",
