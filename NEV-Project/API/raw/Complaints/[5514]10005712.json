THE NOISE CONTINUED AFTER THE VEHICLE WAS TURNED OFF AND IT WONT STOP. I PULL OUT THE ABS FUSE AND THE NOISE STOPED. I TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE DEALER AND HE SAID WHAT IT WAS. THE ABS CONTROL MODULE WAS SHORTED AND THE MOTOR WONT STOP. IT COST ME $900.00 DOLLARS TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM AFTER I TALKED OUT THE SERVICE PERSON, I THINK THIS IS WAY TO EXPENSIVE  AND TO SOON TO FAILED, FOR WHAT I HAVE FOUND OUT GMC NEEDS TO ISSUE A RECALL ON THIS SYSTEM.
