        "summary": "MY MOTORHOME (1994 WINNEBAGO ELANTE) CONTAINS A P-30 CHASSIS.  THE AUTOBRAKE SYSTEM IS VERY POORLY DESIGNED.  THE HYDRAULIC ASSIST ACTUATOR IS POWERED BY THE POWER STEERING PUMP WHICH CONTAINS A VERY VERY SMALL RESERVOIR FOR THE PUMP.  THE ACTUATOR LEAKS BADLY REQUIRING VERY FREQUENT ADDITIONS OF FLUID TO THE RESERVOIR.  THE LEAK IS SO BAD THAT IT COVERS ALL SURFACES UNDER THE MOTOROME WITH FLUID WHICH I AM SURE IS A FIRE HAZARD.   CHEVROLET HAS TOLD ME THAT THE ACTUATOR IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE FROM GENERAL MOTORS AND THAT I SHOULD TRY TO GET A LOCAL SHOP TO REBUILD THE UNIT FOR ME.   I HAVE ALSO BEEN INFORMED BY CHEVROLET THAT IF I LET THE FLUID RUN LOW ENOUGH, THE AUTOBRAKE WILL FAIL WHICH WILL ALLOW THE PARKING BRAKE TO BE APPLIED WHILE GOING DOWN THE ROAD.  THIS OF COURSE IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD.  CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THIS EVENT IF I WERE GOING SAY 60 MILES PER HOUR ?  THERE HAS NOT YET BEEN A WRECK OR AN INCIDENT WHERE THERE WAS VEHICLE DAMAGE; HOWEVER, IT REQUIRES CONSTANT ATTENTION TO ADD FLUID AS SOON AS YOU HEAR THE POWER STEERING PUMP SUCKING IN AIR BUBBLES.  THE RESERVOI CONTAINS ONLY ABOUT A QUART OR SO OF FLUID AND THE LEAK IS SO BAD THAT I HAVE TO ADD FLUID ABOUT EVERY 50 MILES OR SO.   I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT A FIRE SINCE THIS FLUID IS COATING THE EXHAUST PIPES AND MUFFLER UNDER THE MOTORHOME.   ALSO I AM VERY UPSET WITH GENERAL MOTORS IN THAT THEY HAVE DISCONTINUED THE MANUFACTURE OF THE ACTUATOR AND ABOVE THAT THERE IS NO RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM.  THIS IS A MAJOR DESIGN MISTAKE THAT THREATENS THE LIVES OF MY FAMILY AND POSSIBLY LIVES OF AN ON COMING VEHICLE IN THE EVENT OF FAILURE.  *LA",
