WHEN WE ARE TALKING, THEY MENTIONED THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM FOR TOYOTA WITH THIS MODEL. WHEN I ASKED ABOUT POSSIBLE OF RECALL, THEY SAID THEY DON'T THINK THERE WILL BE A RECALL BECAUSE IT IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE. WHY IS IT NOT A SAFETY ISSUE? THERE COULD BE HARMFUL AIR AND METAL PARTICLE BLOW INTO CAR CABIN. NOW I REMEMBERED THAT BEFORE THE A/C STOPPED WORKING, THERE WAS AN VERY SHORT EPISODE OF \"BURN SMELL\" AND THERE WAS SOME TINY PARTICLE BLOWN INTO MY FACE. HOWEVER, I DIDN'T THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT IT BACK THEN BECAUSE THE A/C DIDN'T STOP WORKING RIGHT AWAY.",
