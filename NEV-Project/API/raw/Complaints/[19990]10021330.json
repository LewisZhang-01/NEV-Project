THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, AND WHEN I GOT HOME, THE CAR WOULD NOT GO INTO REVERSE.  THE NEXT DAY, I PLACED THE GEAR IN DRIVE, AND PRESSED THE GAS; IT SOUNDED AS IF THE ENTIRE EVERYTHING WOULD FALL OUT.  MY TRANSMISSION HAS GONE OUT WITHOUT WARNING, AND I KNOW THIS IS NOT NORMAL.  I NOW SEE THAT THERE IS A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM WITH THESE CARS.  PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT MITSUBISHI TAKES RESPONSIBILITY AND COMPENSATE US, THE CONSUMERS.  IF THEY DON'T, THEY WILL ONLY LOSE CUSTOMERS.  THANKS.*AK",
