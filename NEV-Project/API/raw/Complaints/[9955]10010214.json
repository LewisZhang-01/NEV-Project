FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABLE TO GET TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO BE TOWED.  I FOUND OUT THE XTERRAS PROBLEMS WITH THEIR \"FUEL SENDING UNIT\".  *JB  IN RESEARCHING THIS, I FOUND THERE ARE MANY XTERRA OWNERS COMPLAINING OF SUDDEN LOSSES OF POWER AND IT IS THE \"FUEL SENDING UNIT\".  MY PART WAS BACK ORDERED FOR NEARLY TWO WEEKS BECAUSE OF THE DEMAND FOR THIS PART.    I WAS LUCKY NOT TO BE INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT.  I AM AFRAID OTHERS WILL NOT BE SO LUCKY.  I FEEL NISSAN SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECALL THEIR NISSAN XTERRAS AND HAVE THEM REPLACE THE \"FUEL SENDING UNITS.\"",
