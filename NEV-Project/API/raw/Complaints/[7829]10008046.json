VEHICLE STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FREEWAY, RESULTING IN A VERY UNSAFE AND POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING SITUATION.  VEHICLE RESTARTED AFTER PLACING IT IN PARK AND CYCLING THE KEY.  I CONTACTED FORD (800-392-3673), INQUIRED IF THIS IS KNOWN PROBLEM AND WHAT SHOULD BE DONE.  FORD INDICATED THERE WAS NOT A KNOWN PROBLEM, (IN OTHER WORDS THEY LIED), BUT I SHOULD TAKE IT TO THE DEALER TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT.  I TOOK VEHICLE TO THE DEALER THE FOLLOWING MORNING, SO THEY COULD CHECK FOR TROUBLE CODES. THEY CLAIMED TO HAVE FOUND NO CODES, AND THAT NO TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS EXIST FOR THIS ISSUE, AND THAT EVERYTHING ELSE CHECKED OUT OKAY.  I BELIEVE A SAFETY DEFECT EXISTS, AS FORD HAS ISSUED AT LEAST THREE TSB''S (#15434 '' 11/1/2001; #15589 '' 1/1/2002; #0286 - 4/1/2002), ON THIS ISSUE AND MANY CONSUMERS HAVE REGISTERED COMPLAINTS WITH NHTSA.",
