IN REPLACING IT, 2 MAJOR SAFETY DEFECTS WERE DISCOVERED - NO SAFETY/PROTECTIVE FOAM IN THE FRONT BUMPER AND THE SAFETY/CRASH BAR WAS BENT - I WAS TOLD THAT THE CAR MUST HAD BEEN IN A MAJOR ACCIDENT.  I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE ORIGINAL DEALER AND THEY ACCEPTED NO RESPONSIBILITY - THEY SAID I MUST HAVE DONE IT.  I HAVE HAD NO ACCIDENTS OR TICKETS AND MY DRIVING RECORD PROVES THAT. I PURCHASED A VEHICLE HISTORY REPORT, WHICH SHOWED NO ACCIDENT HISTORY. THE ONLY CONCLUSION IS THAT THE DEFECTS WERE PRESENT AT THE TIME OF SALE.  THE CAR SLIPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE SAFETY INSPECTIONS.   *JB",
