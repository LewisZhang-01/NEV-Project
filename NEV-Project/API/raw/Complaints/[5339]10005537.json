        "summary": "I HAVE A 1999 ISUZU TROOPER THAT I PURCHASED ON 7/27/02 WITH 67,000 MILES ON THE ODOMETER. IT NOW HAS 72,800 MILES. IT IS A V6 WITH AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION, AND IS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE. DURING MY OWNERSHIP, AT FOUR SEPARATE OCCASIONS, AS I WAS COMING TO A STOP AT ABOUT THE 5 MPH MARK, THE THROTTLE HAS OPENED FULLY WHILE IN GEAR! I HAVE HAD TO \"PANIC BRAKE\" THE VEHICLE AND PUSH THE TRANSMISSION SELECTOR TO \"NEUTRAL\". WHEN I HAVE DONE THIS, THE ENGINE HAS RACED TO 6000 RPM+ AND HELD, SO I HAVE HAD TO TURN-OFF THE IGNITION SWITCH EACH TIME. AFTER GATHERING MY NERVES, I HAVE RESTARTED THE ENGINE. THE FIRST THREE OCCURRENCES HAPPENED IN TRAFFIC, SO THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN A REAL SAFETY CONCERN. LAST NIGHT, THIS PROBLEM HAPPENED IN MY OWN DRIVEWAY. I NEARLY \"TOOK-OUT\" MY GARAGE. AFTER KEYING-OFF THE IGNITION, I RESTARTED THE ENGINE. THE ENGINE RACED A SECOND TIME WHILE THE TRANSMISSION WAS IN \"NEUTRAL\", SO I SHUT IT OFF AGAIN. I THEN TURNED IT ON AGAIN AND THE ENGINE WENT TO IDLE. THIS PROBLEM IS PRETTY \"HAIRY\", AND ON MONDAY I INTEND TO CALL THE LOCAL ISUZU DEALER (BILLINGS, MONTANA). BUT, I REALLY THINK THIS COMPLAINT NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT TO THE ISUZU TECHNICAL PEOPLE. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.",
