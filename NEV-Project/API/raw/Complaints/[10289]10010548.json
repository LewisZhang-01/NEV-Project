FORD REFUSED TO OFFER ANY HELP WITH THIS EVEN THOUGH THIS HAPPENED AT ONLY 75,000 MILES.  ENGINE SHOWS EVIDENCE OF HEAD GASKET SEEPAGE OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.  IN SERVICE MANAGER'S OPINION \"ONLY A HEAD GASKET FAILURE COULD CAUSE THIS TYPE OF FAILURE.\"  THIS 5.4L V8 IS RENOWNED FOR HEAD GASKET FAILURE.  ACCORDING TO FORD'S OWN ADMISSION THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND THEREFORE THIS MOTOR HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM FROM DAY 1 OF THE MANUFACTURER'S WARRANTY.  6 MONTHS PRIOR TO THIS FAILURE THIS HAD HAD A BROKEN VALVE SPRING.  THESE HEADS ARE ALSO RENOWNED FOR BLOWING SPARK PLUGS RIGHT OF THE HEAD.   *NLM",
