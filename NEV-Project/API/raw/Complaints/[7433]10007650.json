AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY IN 2001 MITSUBISHI.  VEHICLE IS A TOTAL LOSS.  ADJUSTERS FOR BOTH INSURANCE COMPANIES INVOLVED COMMENTED THAT THEY WERE SURPRISED THAT AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.  CONTACTED MITSUBISHI BECAUSE OF MY CONCERN THAT AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.  ASKED IF THEY COULD HAVE REPRESENTATIVE INSPECT VEHICLE.  THEIR RESPONSE WAS THAT THERE WAS PROBABLY TOO LITTLE IMPACT TO DEPLOY AIR BAGS.  WHEN I EXPLAINED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS A TOTAL LOSS THEY SAID I COULD DO WHATEVER I WANTED AT MY OWN EXPENSE AND THEY WOULD SEND ME A BROCHURE ON AIR BAGS.",
