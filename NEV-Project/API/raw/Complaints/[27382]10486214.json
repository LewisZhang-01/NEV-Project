I CHECKED THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAR AND EVEN THOUGH THAT BULB IS STILL FUNCTIONING, THE PLASTIC BLINKER HOUSING IS STARTING TO MELT ON THAT SIDE AS WELL.   CLEARLY THE BULBS ARE BURNING WAY TO HOT TO BE MELTING THE PLASTIC HOUSING AND I WOULD ASSUME SINCE THE BULB ITSELF WAS BURNED THAT THIS IS A LARGER ISSUE OF BOTH POTENTIAL FIRE RISK AND NOW WATER DAMAGE SINCE THE BLINKER HOUSING IS COMPROMISED.  *TR",
