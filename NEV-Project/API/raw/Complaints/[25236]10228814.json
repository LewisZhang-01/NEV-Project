I HAD ONE EXPLODE ON THE HIGHWAY, THE REMAINING 3 SOON BEGAN THE SAME PROCESS OF BLISTERING.  I REPLACED ALL FOUR TIRES WITH THE SAME TYPE OF TIRE FROM GOODYEAR, ASSURANCE.  ONCE AGAIN, WITHIN 25 THOUSAND MILES, THEY BEGAN THE SAME PROCESS, BALLOONING AND BLISTERING.  I REPLACED ALL FOUR WITH ANOTHER TYPE OF TIRE FOR MY FAMILIES SAFETY.  THE TIRES WERE REPLACED AT DISCOUNT TIRE COMPANY IN TYLER TEXAS, ON BROADWAY AVE.  I TRIED TALKING WITH GOODYEAR, AND THEY WOULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE TIRES.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE THESE TIRES, THEY ARE DEFECTIVE.  I HAVE GONE THROUGH 8 TIRES.  THE FIRST REPLACEMENT OCCURRED DECEMBER, 2006, THE SECOND RUN ON REPLACEMENTS WAS APRIL, 2008.  *TR",
