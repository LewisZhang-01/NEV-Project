TWO DAYS AFTER SERVICE THE TRANSMISSION FAILED.  BOARD FORD ALLOWED AN ESP FOR POWER TRAIN AND REPLACED TRANSMISSION.  AT TIME OF REPLACEMENT, BOARD FORD INDICATED THE NEW POWER TRAIN WAS WARRANTED FOR 75,000 MILES.  AT APPROXIMATELY 45,000 MILES ON THE NEW POWER TRAIN, IT LITERALLY EXPLODED FROM THE INSIDE OUT (COMPLETELY CRACKED THE CORE).  CALLED BOARD FORD AND FORD MOTOR AND WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE THE CAR HAS 80,000 MILES ON IT, THE POWER TRAIN WASN'T WARRANTED EVEN THOUGH THE POWER TRAIN ONLY HAS 45,000.00 MILES ON IT.*JB",
