NOISE APPEARS TO BE COMING FROM AREA OF FRONT PASSENGER TIRE AREA....MY MECHANIC HAS REPLACED THE SHOCKS, CONTROL ARM BUSHINGS AND TRANSMISSION MOUNT STRAP AND TRACK BAR BUSHINGS....THIS HAS NOT SOLVED THE PROBLEM.  THE JEEP DEALERSHIP IN NORTH CHARLESTON, SC HAS REPLACED THE SWAY BAR LINKS AND BASICALLY REBUILT THE REAR END....STILL KNOCKING PERSISTS.  JEEP ADVISES NOISE IS NORMAL...I DISAGREE.  JEEP WORKED ON THIS VEHICLE ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO...MY MECHANIC IN JANUARY OF 2003.  KNOCKING ONLY OCCURS OVER LIGHT BUMPS, ROUGHNESS IN ROAD...OR ON DIRT ROADS.  KNOCKING ESPECIALLY LOUD WHEN TURNING A CORNER.  WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE ANY INFORMATION ON THIS.  ALSO, IN MORNINGS ESPECIALLY WHEN COLD OUTSIDE WHEN YOU PUT JEEP INTO REVERSE A LOUD WHINING NOISE COMING FROM REAR.  HAVE HAD TRANSMISSION FLUID CHANGED, BUT DID NOT HELP.",
