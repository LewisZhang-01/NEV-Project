ON THIS DATE, TRANSMISSION SUDDENLY FAILED TO BE ABLE TO SHIFT INTO 3RD GEAR, LIMITING TOP SPEED TO LEVELS BELOW SAFE LIMITS ON MOST HIGHWAYS.  THIS OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY, AND WAS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS.  TOWED TO DEALER, DEALER RECOMMENDS REMANUFACTURED TRANSMISSION, ASKING APPROXIMATELY $4000 FOR PARTS AND LABOR.  I DIDN'T (AND STILL DON'T) HAVE THE MONEY FOR THAT, SO I MANAGED TO LIMP HOME WITH IT WHERE IT HAS SAT SINCE.  AT SOME POINT SINCE THEN IT HAS LOST THE ABILITY TO SHIFT INTO 2ND GEAR.  DEALER ALSO FOUND POSSIBLE WHEEL BEARING AND FRONT ROTOR PROBLEMS, IN ADDITION TO FAILURE OF FRONT CATALYTIC CONVERTERS.  WANTS ROUGHLY $6000 TO FULLY REPAIR VEHICLE.  *NLM",
