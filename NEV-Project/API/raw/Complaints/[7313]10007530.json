        "summary": "AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FAILURE - VEHICLE STARTED TO SKIP WHEN SHIFTING FROM 1ST GEAR TO SECOND GEAR. TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD I WAS 200 MILES OUT OF WARRANTY AND THEY COULD NOT FIX IT UNDER WARRANTY (EVEN THOUGH I HAD BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS FOR A MONTH BEFORE THAT AND HADN'T TIME TO GET IN TO GET IT LOOKED AT). WAS TOLD THAT OTHER TRANSMISSIONS WERE ALSO FAILING, BUT DODGE WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING. I AM A FORMER CHRYSLER EMPLOYEE, AS IS MY FATHER. ALWAYS BEEN LOYAL TO CHRYSLER PRODUCTS, BUT AFTER THIS, I CAN'T TELL ENOUGH PEOPLE TO BUY FOREIGN AND NOT DOMESTIC - CHEAP QUALITY AND POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. THEY SELL YOU A VEHICLE AND THE PROBLEMS ARE YOURS - TOO BAD. FINALLY GOT SOME HELP FROM THE CHRYSLER CORPORATE CENTER MICHIGAN.FIRST DEALER SAID \"PASSING CABLE WAS PROBLEM, THEN LATER ON FOUND TRANSMISSION WAS FAULT. A REBUILT ONE WAS INSTALLED, AND NOW THAT TOO IS HAVING PROBLEMS. THIS VEHICLE IS USED ONLY TO GO TO AND FROM WORK AND AROUND TOWN. NO HEAVY HAULING, HEAVY TOWING (DO HAUL PUSH MOWER AND HAND TRIMMER, RAKE, ETC) OR ANY HEAVY DRIVING. TRUCK IS MAINTAINED ON SCHEDULE - TREATED WITH CARE LIKE A KID.",
