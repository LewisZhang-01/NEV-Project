WITHOUT WARNING, MY TRANSMISSION SHIFTED FROM FOURTH TO SECOND, SENDING MY CAR INTO A SIDEWAYS SKID AS IF I HAD HIT THE BRAKES...HARD. FORTUNATELY, THE CAR BESIDE ME ON THE RIGHT WAS ABLE TO AVOID HITTING ME AS WAS THE CAR BEHIND ME. LEFT WITH SECOND GEAR, I LIMPED BACK TO THE DEALER AND RECEIVED MY CAR, WITH A NEW TRANSMISSION, THREE WEEKS LATER. I AM LUCKY TO HAVE NOT BEEN INJURED AND DO NOT TRUST THIS CAR ANY LONGER. IT WAS BOUGHT FOR INSURING THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY AND I AM WORRIED ABOUT A REPEAT FAILURE. THANKS, BEN.       PH   *NLM    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**768534",
