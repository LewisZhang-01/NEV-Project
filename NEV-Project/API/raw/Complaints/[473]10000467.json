THE ERRATIC BEHAVIOR HAPPENS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BUT APPEARS WORSE (ESPECIALLY SHUTTING OFF UNEXPECTEDLY) IN WARM WEATHER.  RECENTLY I HAVE FOUND THAT TURNING THE WIPERS TO HIGH WILL USUALLY RESTART THEM AFTER THEY SHUT OFF.  ERRATIC BEHAVIOR DURING INTERMITTENT OPERATION INCLUDES MULTIPLE WIPES (SOMETIMES MORE THAN 10) PER CYCLE.  THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN PRESENT FOR APPROXIMATELY THE LAST 30,000 MILES (I AM CURRENTLY AT 72,500).  I AM ESTIMATING THE INCIDENT DATE BELOW AROUND THE FIRST TIME I NOTICED THE PROBLEM.  THE DATE IS ACCURATE +/- 6 MONTHS.  I HAVE NOT YET CONTACTED THE DEALER ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  I AM PLANNING TO DO SO EITHER TODAY (1/2/03) OR TOMORROW.",
