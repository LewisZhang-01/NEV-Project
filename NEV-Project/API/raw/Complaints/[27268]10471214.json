I RODE ON THE CAR AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON AND NOT ONLY HAS THE ORIGINAL CRACK DOUBLED IN SIZE THERE IS ANOTHER ONE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE AIR BAG DEPLOYMENT.  BOTH CRACKS ARE ON THE EDGE OF THE AIR BAG \"BOX\"  NOW I AM VERY CONCERNED AND I GET ONLY LINE TO SEE HOW TO EITHER REPAIR OR REPLACE THIS DASH.  AFTER SEARCHING I SEE THAT THERE ARE ALOT OF COMPLAINTS WITH THIS SAME ISSUE.  IT SEEMS ACURA HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE MATERIAL USED TO COVER THE DASH.  THEY NEED TO STEP UP AND REPLACE THESE DASH BOARDS.  *TR",
