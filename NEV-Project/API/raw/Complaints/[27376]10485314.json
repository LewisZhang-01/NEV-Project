THE FIRST TIME, THERE WERE ERROR CODES THAT COULD BE USED TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM BUT IN LESS THAN A MONTH THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED AND THIS TIME THE ENTIRE THROTTLE BODY HAS TO BE REPLACED. WHILE DRIVING THE CAR LOST THE ABILITY TO ACCELERATE AND ALL PROPULSION SYSTEMS DID NOT WORK. THE BRAKES WORKED FINE BUT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM THE CAR WHEN I PRESSED DOWN ON THE ACCELERATOR. THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE FIXED AND A RECALL SHOULD BE ORDERED. I HAVE HAD TO PAY FOR THIS PROBLEM 2X AND COULD HAVE BEEN HURT WHEN I WAS UNABLE TO ACCELERATE ON THE HIGHWAY AND JUST ABLE TO GET OFF THE ROAD IN TIME. *TR",
