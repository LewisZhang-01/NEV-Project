MY MECHANIC FOUND THAT IT IS DUE TO THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD CRACK AND TOLD ME THAT IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR 95-98 PROTEGE. HE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE IN THE BULLETIN. I TOOK HIS SUGGESTION AND CALLED THE DEALER, BUT THE ANSWER WAS NEGATIVE. I AM VERY CONCERNED BECAUSE THE MONOXIDE FROM THE EXHAUST COULD POTENTIALLY KILL A PERSON IN SILENCE. I HAVE BEEN  DRIVING THE CAR WITH THE WINDOW OPEN MOST TIME, JUST TO BE SAFE. I HOPE THAT MAZDA WILL PLACE A RECALL ON IT",
