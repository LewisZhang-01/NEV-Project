FIRST TIME THEY TOLD ME THAT THE IDLE CONTROL VALUE WAS CORRODED AND REPLACED IT.  THE SECOND TIME THEY TOLD ME THEY COULD NOT FIND A PROBLEM.  THIS IS A VERY FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE TO HAVE YOUR CAR QUIT ON YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC AND I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SINCE IT IS HAPPENING TO OTHER PEOPLE. *JB",
