OVER TIME THE NOISE GOT PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER AND EVENTUALLY MADE A CLANGING SOUND AS I TOOK OFF FROM A STOP.  THE NOISE WAS LOUDER THAN I'VE EVER HEARD, SO I DROVE THE TRUCK BACK HOME A PARKED IT.  I'VE TOLD FRIENDS THAT I NEEDED ANOTHER TRANSMISSION AND THE MORE I TOLD THE MORE I REALIZED THAT THERE WAS OF THE SAME PROBLEMS IN OTHER CHEVROLET TRUCKS.  THIS MAY BE COINCIDENCE BUT IT'S TO LARGE OF A SCALE THAT'S COSTING MANY PEOPLE LOTS OF MONEY.   *NLM",
