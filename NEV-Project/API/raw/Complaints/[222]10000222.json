I DROVE FOR OVER ONE HOUR ON ONE DAY AND COULD NOT DISTINGUISH MY SPEED.  THE INSTRUMENT PANEL LIGHTING IS POOR.  I HAVE NOTIFIED NISSAN AND SENT LETTERS BUT HAVE NOT YET HAD A RESPONSE.  THE DEALER INVESTIGATED THE PROBLEM AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT THIS IS HOW THE PANEL WAS DESIGNED.  AFTER THE DEALER COMPLETED HIS WORK, I RECEIVED A VOICE MESSAGE FROM NISSAN CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I RETURNED THE CALL AND LEFT THEM A VOICE MESSAGE TO RETURN MY CALL.  THEY NEVER DID, SO ON NOVEMBER 18, I SENT A LETTER WITH ATTACHMENTS TO MR SEMPLE, THE PRESIDENT OF NISSAN DESIGN AMERICA.  AS OF TODAY, I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM HIM OR ANY OF HIS STAFF.  YESTERDAY, I MAILED A RESPONSE TO NISSAN ON A CUSTOMER SERVICE FORM THEY HAD SENT TO ME QUESTIONING HOW I WAS TREATED.  I ADDRESSED A LETTER TO MR. BOSLEY WHO IS THE VP OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I WOULD BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU A COPY OF ALL DOCUMENTS.",
