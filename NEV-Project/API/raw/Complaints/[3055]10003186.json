        "summary": "I HAVE A 1999 HONDA ODYSSEY MINIVAN.  THE MANUAL SLIDING DOORS STICK IN WET OR SNOWY WEATHER.  SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET THE DOORS OPEN BUT IT TAKES SEVERLA MINUTES.  MANYL TIMES I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO OPEN EITHER SLIDING DOOR AND HAVE HAD TO PULL MY KIDS OVER THE FRONT SEATS TO GET THEM OUT OF THE VEHICLE.  IT IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD WHEN YOU CANNOT OPEN THE DOORS TO GET YOUR CHILDREN OUT OF THE VEHICLE.  THIS PROBLEM IS WIDESPREAD ON HONDA ODYSSEYS.  MY SISTER HAS A 2000 ODYSSEY AND PULLED THE ENTIRE HANDLE OFF THE DOOR TRYING TO GET THE DOOR OPEN.  HONDA HAS 2 SERVICE BULLETINS DETAILING A FIX FOR REPLACING THE WEATHERSTRIPPING BUT THEY WON'T COVER THE COST FOR ME BECAUSE IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  I FEEL THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND THAT THESE DOORS SHOULD BE RECALLED.",
