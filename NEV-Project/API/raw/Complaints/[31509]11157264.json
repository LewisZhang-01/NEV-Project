WHEN I LOOKED UP MY PANORAMIC SUNROOF WAS GONE. NOTHING WAS DRIVING IN FRONT OF OR BESIDE ME. NOTHING HIT MY CAR. HOWEVER MERCEDES SAYS IT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND SOMETHING HIT IT, BUT MY INSURANCE WON'T PAY FOR THE SUNROOF REPAIR BECAUSE OF CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS. THEY SAY IT IS MERCEDES RESPONSIBILITY. HOWEVER, MERCEDES BASICALLY CALLED ME A LIAR AND REFUSES TO REPLACE THE PANORAMIC SUNROOF. THEY WANT TO CHARGE ME $3200 TO REPAIR IT.",
