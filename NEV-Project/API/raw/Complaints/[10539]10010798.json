        "summary": "THE HARNESS ADJUSTER ON BRITAX MARATHON CONVERTIBLE CAR SEAT DOES NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WHICH COULD ALLOW A CHILD TO BE IMPROPERLY SECURED IN THE RESTRAINT.   IT APPEARS THAT SOME OF THE HARNESS ADJUSTER STRAPS ON BRITAX MARATHON'S WERE ROUTED IMPROPERLY CAUSING THE HARNESS TO BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ADJUST.  BRITAX HAS SAID THE ADJUSTER IS CERTIFIED TO WORK PROPERLY WHEN THE STRAP IS ROUTED BOTH OVER AND UNDER THE PLASTIC RIDGE BEHIND THE ADJUSTER MECHANISM.  HOWEVER, IN SEATS WITH THE STRAP ROUTED OVER THE PLASTIC, THE HARNESS APPEARS TO CATCH ON THE RIDGES AND EVENTUALLY I BELIEVE THIS WILL LEAD TO FRAYING OF THE ADJUSTER STRAP.  ON MANY OF THESE SEATS WITH THE STRAP ROUTED OVER THE PLASTIC RIDGES, THE HARNESS STRAPS ARE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SECURE TIGHTLY AROUND A CHILD.  OWNER'S OF THESE SEATS HAVE CONTACTED BRITAX NUMEROUS TIMES AND ARE TOLD THAT NOTHING WILL BE DONE TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM.  SINCE THE EARLY PRODUCTION OF THESE SEATS (FALL 2002), BRITAX HAS \"STANDARDIZED\" THE WAY THEY ROUTE THE ADJUSTER (NOW UNDER THE PLASTIC RIDGES) BUT THEY ARE UNWILLING TO PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE TO OWNER'S OF SEATS WITH ADJUSTER STRAPS ROUTED OVER THE PLASTIC RIDGES.    *JB",
