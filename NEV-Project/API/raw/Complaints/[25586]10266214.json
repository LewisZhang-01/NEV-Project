THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME.  AT THE TIME I HAD NO IDEA WHAT CAUSED IT.  I WAS TRAVELING AT APPROX. 65 MPH ON A HIGHWAY WHEN I DROVE TROUGH A DIP IN THE ROAD UNDER AN OVERPASS.  MY TRUCK WENT IN A SEVERE SHIMMY.  I ALMOST LOST FULL CONTROL OF THE TRUCK.  HAD THERE BEEN A VEHICLE NEXT TO ME IN THE LEFT LANE I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AVOID HITTING IT.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PSI  OF AIR IN MY TIRES WERE AT THE TIME.  THEY WERE THE STOCK TIRES THAT CAME WITH THE TRUCK  OFF THE LOT.  I HAVE SINCE CHANGED THESE TIRES DUE TO WEAR.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE AND NEEDS TO BE GIVEN A LOT OF ATTENTION. *TR",
