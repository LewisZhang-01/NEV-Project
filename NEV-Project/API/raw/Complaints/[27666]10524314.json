AFTER HAVING THE VEHICLE FOR TWO WEEKS, I WAS BACKING OUT OF MY GARAGE AND WHEN I PUT THE VEHICLE IN DRIVE, THE MONITOR WHERE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA SHOWS UP WENT BLANK.  THE RADIO CAME ON BUT I COULD NOT SEE ANY OF THE CHANNELS ON THE MONITOR.  I TURNED THE POWER OFF AND THEN BACK ON AND EVERYTHING WORKS AGAIN.  THIS HAPPENS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE SAID THEY CAN ONLY RUN A TEST ON THE CAR WHEN IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS AND FOR ME TO BRING IT TO THEM WHEN I HAVE THE PROBLEM.  THEY DO NOT SHOW ANY SERVICE WARRANTIES FOR THIS ISSUE.  THE PROBLEM IS THIS HAPPENS WHEN I AM GOING TO WORK AT 5:00 A.M. AND ONLY WHEN THE VEHICLE IS INSIDE A GARAGE.  IF THE VEHICLE IS PARKED OUTSIDE IT DOES NOT HAPPEN.  *TR",
