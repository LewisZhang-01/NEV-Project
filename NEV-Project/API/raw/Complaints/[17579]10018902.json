THE BRAKES ON THIS VEHICLE ARE GROSSLY UNDERSIZED AND CHEVROLET KNOWS THIS.  THAT IS WHY THE BRAKES ON THE NEW 2003 SUBURBAN ARE LARGER EVEN THOUGH THE VEHICLE IS SEVERAL HUNDRED POUNDS LIGHTER THAN THIS MODEL.  I HAD INTENDED TO KEEP THIS CAR FOR AT LEAST 6 OR 7 YEARS BUT MUST NOW GIVE IT UP BECAUSE I AM WORRIED THE BRAKES WILL FAIL ALL TOGETHER.  ALSO, THE SEAT HEATERS ON BOTH FRONT SEATS QUIT WORKING AFTER THE FIRST YEAR AND WOULDN'T BE REPLACED BY THE DEALER. *JB",
