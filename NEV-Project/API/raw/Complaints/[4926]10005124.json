THIS MODEL HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF 4 NHTSA SERVICE BULLETINS REGARDING THE PREMATURE WEAR AND OR/FAILURE OF THE FRONT BRAKE ROTORS, YET DAIMLER-CHRYSLER REFUSED TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM AT THEIR OWN COST.  I HAVE PAID A TOTAL OF $852.00 ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS TO REPAIR THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE FIRST TIME THE ROTORS FAILED WAS AT 29,000 MILES (WELL UNDER THE WARRANTY).  I AGAIN HAD TO REPAIR THEM AT 39,000 MILES (ONLY 3 MONTHS OUT OF WARRANTY).  THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF OTHER CONSUMERS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.  PLEASE HELP!!!  *JB",
