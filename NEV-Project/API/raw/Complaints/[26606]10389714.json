I CONTACTED A DEALER-  SHIP AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THIS PROBLEM AND THEY  WOULD COVER IT BUT THAT THE CONDITION HAS TO EXIST  AT THE TIME I AM BRINGING THE CAR IN.  THIS IS A PROBLEM  BECAUSE THE LIGHTS ARE NORMAL WHEN THE CAR IS LATER  RE-STARTED.  I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DOCUMENT THE FACT IM HAVING AN INTERMITTENT  PROBLEM NOW FOR A WARRANTY REPAIR AFTER 50,000 MILES.  *TR",
