        "summary": "I WAS TRAVELING AT A HIGH SPEED ON THE BRONX RIVER PKWY AND MY PASSENGER REACHED INTO THE BACK SEAT.  HER LEG HIT THE KEY AND TURNED THE CAR OFF WHILE I WAS TRAVELING AT 60 MPH.  LUCKILY NOBODY WAS HURT.  THE CAR LOCKED UP AND I SHIFTED INTO NEUTRAL.  IT TOOK A FEW ANXIOUS MOMENTS/MINUTE OR TWO BEFORE I REALIZED WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  THIS HAPPENED TWO MORE TIMES WHEN I DECIDED TO CONTACT SAAB.  THEIR RESPONSE IN A LETTER IS AS FOLLOWS \" WE HAVE REVIEWED YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE PLACEMENT OF THE IGNITION SWITCH WITH GARDEN CITY SAAB, CORPORATE TECHNICIANS, AND FIELD REPRESENTATIVES.  SAAB CARS USA, INC. HAS DETERMINED YOUR VEHICLE IS OPERATING AS DESIGNED.\" !!!!!   SO, THEY HAVE DESIGNED A CAR TO SWITCH OFF WHILE DRIVING.  ALL I ASKED WAS TO BE LET OUT OF MY LEASE AS THIS IS A DANGEROUS CAR AND I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE DRIVING IN IT.  THEY, BY MEANS OF THIS LETTER, ARE REFUSING AND TELLING ME THEY HAVE NO ISSUE.  FYI THE 9.3 KEY IS BELOW THE SEAT, IN THE 9.5 THEY DECIDED TO RAISE IT ABOVE THE SEAT.  THIS IS PROBABLY WHY THEY HAVEN'T ADDRESSED IT YET.  I GUESS THEY ARE WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO GET REALLY HURT OR KILLED.  CAN ANY ONE HELP????  *JB",
