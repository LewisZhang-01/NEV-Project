I WAS INFORMED THAT THE ROD BEARING HAD GONE OUT AND THE MOTOR WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED.  AFTER A FEW DAYS OF TALKING TO CHRYSLER THEY TOLD ME TO TAKE IT TO ONE OF THEIR DEALERSHIPS SO THEY CAN LOOK AT IT AT MY COST.  THE CAR HAD 82,121 MILES ON IT SO THERE WAS NO WARRANTY.  CHRYSLER GAVE ME THE RUN AROUND FOR ABOUT A WEEK. THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME 200 TO 400 $ JUST TO LOOK AT IT.  I WAS TOLD THAT CHRYSLER WOULD NOT PAY FOR ANY THING BECAUSE OF EXCESS SLUDGE IN THE MOTOR.  NEED LESS TO SAY I WENT TO A DIFFERENT COMPANY TO PUT IN A REMANUFACTURE MOTOR.  THESE 2.7 LITER APPARENTLY HAS A LOT A DEFECTS.   *AK",
