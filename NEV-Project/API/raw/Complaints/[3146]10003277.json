        "summary": "I AM ONE OF THE MANY MANY CUSTOMERS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING COMPLETE FAILURES WITH THE CHRYSLER 41TE ULTRADRIVE TRANSMISSIONS. IN MY CASE I HADE A COMPLETE TRANSMITION REPLACEMENT AT 79,000 MILES. AT 123,000 MILES WHILE PULLING INTO TRAFFIC THE VEHICLE STOPPED MOVING AND THE ENGINE STARTED REVVING VERY HIGH. I HADE THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALER THAT HAD INSTALLED THE FIRST TRANSMISSION. I WAS INFORMED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS OVER ITS 36,000 WARRANTY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  I HAVE DECLINED THE $2900 ESTIMATE AND I AM CURRENTLY GETTING A SECOND OPINION ON THE REPAIR.     MY CONCERN IS THAT WHILE I WAS RESEARCHING THE PROBLEMS OF THIS TRANSMISSION, I FOUND THAT MOST OWNERS OF THE 41TE TRANSMISSION WILL EXPERIENCE SIMILAR PROBLEMS AT AN AVERAGE OF 80,000 MILES. I FURTHER LEARNED THAT CHRYSLER KNOWS THAT THESE TRANSMISSIONS WILL FAIL, AS THEY HAVE BEEN REPLACING THEM SENSE THE 1980''S WHEN IT WAS NAMED THE A604.  WE NEED TO GET THESE VEHICLES OFF THE ROAD UNTIL THE PROBLEMS CAN BE RESOLVED. IN MY CASE, I JUST EXPERIENCED THE INCONVENIENCE OF FINDING MYSELF STRANDED. IF MY TIMING HAD BEEN DIFFERENT, MY SITUATION WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE.",
