THEY HAD CUT COSTS BY INSTALLING A NISSAN FRONTIER BRAKE SYSTEM WHICH WEIGHS ABOUT HALF THE WEIGHT OF A NISSAN ARMADA.  THIS HAS CAUSED THE BRAKES TO GIVE OUT EVERY 5000 MILES AND ALSO CREATES AN UNSAFE BRAKING SYSTEM.  IT ALSO ALLOWS THE VEHICLE TO DIVE WHEN BRAKING NOT GIVING A SAFE BRAKING REACTION TIME.      THE DEALERSHIPS HAVE CONSTANTLY REPLACED MY BRAKES (3 TIMES WITHIN 15,OOO MILES) AND DID ADMIT THAT NISSAN HAS ADMITTED TO PUTTING AN INFERIOR BRAKING SYSTEM.",
