        "summary": "IN FEB 2002 MY CAR ENGINE SIEZED UP 58 MILES OVER THE WARRANTY.  I HAD TO REPLACE THE ENGINE BUT STILL HAD A PROBLEM WITH MY CAR.  AS A MATTER OF FACT, SINCE I PURCHASED THE CAR, THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS LITE UP AND IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME THAT IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE GAS CAP NOT WORKING PROPERLY.  SINCE THIS IS THE 1ST CAR I HAD PURCHASED, NOW BEING SEPERATED, I ACCEPTED IT.  ANYWAYS, AFTER I REPLACED THE ENGINE, THE CAR STILL HAD A PROBLEM OF BURNING OIL.  I KEEP OIL IN THE CAR BECAUSE I COULDNT TAKE IT BACK TO A SHOP SINCE I JUST PAID $3000 FOR AN ENGINE.  SINCE FEB, I HAD TO HAVE MY EMISSIONS TEST DONE IN MAY, I FAILED, EXPLAINING MY CATALIT CONVERTER OR SOMETHING WITHIN THERE WAS CAUSING PROBLEMS.  SINCE THEN, MY CAR RUNS GOOD BUT STILL HAS THE OIL PROBLEM AND TAPS WHICH NO ONE COULD TELL ME THE PROBLEM.  NOW TODAY, MY CAR BREAKS DOWN AGAIN, ENGINE SEIZED AND NO WARRANTY OR NOTHING AND I STILL OWE ON THIS CAR.  IS THERE ANY HELP I CAN GET ON THIS SITUATION?  *AK",
