        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING MY 2012 CHRYSLER 300 ON 8-19-2017 MY RADIO CUT OFF. I ALSO NOTICED THAT MY DASHBOARD LIGHTS WERE FLASHING ON AND OFF. MY CAR LOST POWER WHILE I WAS DRIVING, I WAS ABLE TO COAST WITHOUT ANY POWER OR BREAKS INTO A SAFE ARE. I,LET MY CAR REST FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES. I STARTED MY CAR AND THE HEAT CAME ON AND WOULD NOT CUT OFF. MY CAR WAS RUNNING RUFF AND THE LIGHTS INSIDE JUST STARTED FLASHING ON AND OFF. MY CAR HAS A PUSH TO START BUTTON ON IT AND IT WOULD NOT CUT OFF WHEN I PRESSED THE BRAKE AND  THE PUSH TO START BUTTON INTO THE OFF POSITION. I HAD MY CAR TOWED TO A DEALERSHIP, AND I AM WAITING ON THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST TO BE COMPLETED. I HAVE DONE SOME  RESEARCH ON RECALLS FOR MY MODEL CAR, AND SOME 2012  CHYSLER 300 HUNDREDS WERE RECALLED FOR A SPECIFIC PROBLEM DEALING WITH THE 160 VOLT ALTENATOR. I HAVE SEEN MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE, CHYSLER IS NOT RECALLING ANY MODELS WITH THE 180 VOLT ALTENATOR. I AM ASSUMING BECAUSE MY CAR DOES NOT HAVE AN ACTIVE RECALL NOTICE ON IT, THAT MY CAR HAS 180 VOLT ALTENATOR ON IT. IF THAT IS THE CASE? I HAVE READ OVER 300 COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE 180 VOLT  ALTENATOR. I WAS LUCKY THAT I HAD JUST GOTTEN OF THE FREEWAY AND WAS NOT GOING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. WHAT ACTIONS HAVE THE NHTSA TAKEN TOO PROTECT CONSUMERS FOR THIS DANGEROUS SAFETY ISSUE? EVEN WHEN MY CAR IS FIXED, IF THE CAN FIX IT I WILL NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING IT. THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT NEEDS TOO BE ADDRESSED BY THE CHRYSLER CORPORARTION AND THE NHTSA.",
