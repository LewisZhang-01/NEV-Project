MY FORD FOCUS 2015 WAS MANUFACTURED ON MARCH 20, 2015, IN THE SAME MICHIGAN PLANT AND IS EXPERIENCING THE SAME CLUTCH SHUDDERING AS DESCRIBED IN YOUR RECALL NOTICE.  FORD'S ANSWER WAS THAT VIN NUMBERS ARE THE SOLE METHOD FOR DETERMINING RECALLS.  THEY CLEARLY DID NOT THROW THE NET FAR ENOUGH TO COVER THEIR QUALITY AND DESIGN ISSUES.  AFFECTED VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH 1.0L FOX GTDI OR 1.6L SIGMA GTDI ENGINES WITH B6 MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS MAY EXPERIENCE CLUTCH SLIP WHICH CAN LEAD TO A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION.  THIS VEHICLE IS DRIVEN BY MY DAUGHTER AND SHE EXPERIENCES SHUTTERING WHEN SHE ACCELERATES THE VEHICLE.  SHE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH POWER TO ACCELERATE QUICKLY WHICH COULD EASILY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT AS SHE PULLS OUT IN TRAFFIC.  I HAVE READ ABOUT MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME SCARY EXPERIENCE WHILE ACCELERATING AND THEIR FRUSTRATION AND CONFUSION ABOUT WHY THEIR FOCUS WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  I WOULD LIKE FORD TO RE-EXAMINE HOW THEY DETERMINED THE VIN NUMBERS AFFECTED AND WHY MY VEHICLE WAS NOT INCLUDED SINCE IT CLEARLY HAS THE SAME POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS ISSUE.  YOUR HELP WOULD BE APPRECIATED.",
