FREQUENT FAILURE TO SHIFT AT ALL OR FAILURE TO SHIFT FOR PROLONGED INTERVALS (SOMETIMES MILES).  OCCASIONAL SLAMMING INTO GEAR AND CAR LURCHING FORWARD.  WE HAVE HAD 3 INCIDENTS THAT ALMOST LEAD TO ACCIDENTS.  WE HAVE HAD CAR IN FOR REPAIRS ON 5 SEPARATE OCCASIONS, BUT DEALER SAID THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG.  LETTER OF NOTIFICATION OF DEFECT TO MANUFACTURER SENT TO MAZDA CORPORATE ON 3/22/03. CAR WAS TAKEN INTO DEALER FOR FINAL CHANCE TO REPAIR.  DEALER STILL SAYS THEY CAN FIND NOTHING WRONG.  WE PURCHASED A 2ND MAZDA PROTEGE LX AT THE SAME TIME, AND WE HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH ITS TRANSMISSION AND IT SHIFTS SMOOTHLY AND PROPERLY.  EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A DANGEROUS AND POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING ISSUE AND THIS CAR IS CLEARLY A LEMON, MAZDA HAS DONE NOTHING TO REPLACE THIS CAR.   *NLM",
