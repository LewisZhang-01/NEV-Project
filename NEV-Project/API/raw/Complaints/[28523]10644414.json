WHEN THE BRAKE IS APPLIED AT THIS TIME THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF BREAKING POWER AS WELL AS A GRINDING AND JERKING MOTION.  IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO A STOP.   I HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT IF I TURN ON THE VEHICLE AND LEAVE IT IN PART POSITION FOR 10 MINUTES OR SO, THE BRAKE LIGHT WILL ALSO GO ON.  IF I PUT THE CAR INTO DRIVE, THE SAME LOSS OF BRAKING POWER OCCURS.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE LOSS OF BRAKING POWER IN VARIOUS SITUATIONS FROM GOING 75 MILES ON THE FREEWAY TO AS LITTLE AS BRINGING THE CAR OUT OF PARKED POSITION.  THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS WITH THE SAME LOSS OF POWER AND NISSAN HAS FAILED TO ISSUE A RECALL.    *TR",
