I COULD NOT STEER OR START IT AGAIN AND WAS ALMOST HIT BY AN 18 WHEEL VEHICLE AND KILLED. I IMMEDIATELY PUT MY FLASHERS ON AND KEPT RETRYING TO START THE CAR TO GET IT OFF THE ROAD. THIS COULD HAVE KILLED ME AND OTHERS THIS MORNING! THIS IS A FORD MOTOR COMPANY MECHANICAL ISSUE AND THEY KNEW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL VEHICLE AND CHOOSE TO NOT RECALL IT!! HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED FROM THIS PROBLEM THAT WE ARE NOT AWARE OF??? I TOOK THE CAR AND HAD IT CHECKED OUT AND THEY SAID THAT FORD ISSUED A BULLETIN ON THIS EXACT ISSUE AND HOW TO FIX IT! ONLY NOW, ITS GOING TO COST ME, THE CONSUMER $2000 OR MORE TO FIX!!
