        "summary": "I WAS COMING FROM THE DOCTOR WITH MY WIFE WHEN MY TRUCK STARTS DOING A LAUD KNOCKING SOUND. I COULD NOT FIGURE WHAT WAS GOING ON. THE TEMPERATURE, BATTERY, OIL PRESSURE AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE. THE NEXT DAY I TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC AND HE TOLD ME I HAD A BAD HEAD GASKET AND FOUND THAT IT DAMAGE A #1 CYL, BEND CONNECTING ROD, CRACK PISTON AND OF COURSE A BAD HEAD. TO FIX IT WAS OVER $2,500. I LIVE IN A SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY WITH A FIX INCOME SINCE FEBRUARY AND CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY ALL THAT MONEY AND BARELY MAKE THE PAYMENTS. THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT IT HAS BEEN LOTS OF PROBLEMS WITH THESE ENGINES AND HEAD GASKETS. I TOLD MY STEPDAUGHTER AND WE WENT ON-LINE SURPRISED TO SEE  LOTS OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  FORD KNOWS ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS SINCE 1998 ON THE 3.8-LITER V-6 HEAD GASKET USED BETWEEN 1988 AND 1995 ON THE TAURUS, SABLE AND CONTINENTAL, AS WELL AS THE 1995 WINDSTAR AND WE THINK THEY DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM NOT UNTIL WAY AFTER 1998 WHEN THEY ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN. NOW 1998'S F-150 GOT EXACLLY THE SAME PRABLEM.    I DON''T KNOW WHAT TO DO !!!     I HAVE NOT CALL FORD CREDIT TO TELL THEM YET.    ANNY SUGESTIONS PLEASE E-MAIL ME  AT JESSYM28@HOTMAIL.COM",
