AFTER SITTING ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND LETTING THE CAR SIT WITH THE ENGINE OFF, YOU CAN START IT UP AND THEN DRIVE FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES AT HIGH SPEED BEFORE THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURS.  AT LOWER SPEEDS THE PROBLEM IS NOT AS PREVALENT.   PINPOINT DIAGNOSTIC COMPUTER FIRST PROVIDE THE MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR AS THE PROBLEM. SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER THE NEW MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR WAS REPLACED I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM (EXACTLY THE SAME SYMPTOMS).  THIS TIME THE DIAGNOSTIC COMPUTER PROVIDED THE FUEL PUMP AS THE PROBLEM.  I NOTICED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN FROM FORD ABOUT THE FUEL PULSE DAMPER, BUT THEY SAY THAT BULLETINS ARE NOT OF ANY ISSUE. I HAVE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO FIND MANY OTHER INSTANCES OF FAULTY FUEL PUMPS IN THE FOCUS THROUGH RANDOM INTERNET OBSERVATION.  MY CAR IS APPROXIMATELY 5 TO 6 THOUSAND MILES PAST WARRANTY (MILES ONLY, NOT YEARS) AND I WILL BE SPENDING THE EQUIVALENT OF 4 CAR PAYMENTS TO HAVE THE MASS AIR FLOW SENSOR AND THE FUEL PUMP FIXED.  ANY INFORMATION ON THIS PROBLEM WOULD BE APPRECIATED.    *JB",
