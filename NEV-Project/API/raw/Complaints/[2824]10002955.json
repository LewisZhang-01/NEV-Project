I WAS TOLD THAT FORD'S CHOICE OF \"SEALED BALL JOINTS\" WAS THE REASON FOR THE FAILURE-PRONE BALL JOINTS, AND THAT THIS IS \"NORMAL\".  ARE ALL EXPLORERE USERS IN THIS ENDANGERED POSITION?  IF SO, IS A RECALL NECESSARY?  IS THERE A WAY YOU CAN CHECK HOW MANY OWNERS HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THESE BAD JOINTS?  MY 91 EXPLORER WENT 135000 MILES WITHOUT BALL JOINT PROBLEMS.  BALL JOINT FAILURE AT SPEED IS DANGEROUS.    THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.",
