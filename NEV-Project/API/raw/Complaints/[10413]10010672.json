ACCORDING TO MY OWNERS MANUAL THE VEHICLE IS EQUIPPED WITH THE LATCH, HOWEVER IT IS MISSING THE REAR LATCH TETHERS. THE OWNERS MANUAL CLEARLY INDICATES  FOR THE CENTER POSITION THE LATCH ANCHOR IS LOCATED DIRECTLY BEHIND THE SEAT ON THE FLOOR OF THE CARGO AREA, BUT THERE IS NO LATCH ANCHOR THERE. I AM NOT SURE IF SOME DESIGNER CHANGED THE POSITION OF THE LATCH ANCHOR AND DID NOT CHANGE THE OWNERS MANUAL BUT I HAVE LOOKED AND CAN FIND NO REAR LATCH ANCHOR FOR THE CENTER SEATING.  *JB",
