THEY HAD A SERVICE BULLETIN ON IT AND REPAIRED IT AT A COST OF $193.59, BUT TRUTHFULLY $139.95 DIRECTLY RELATED.  I FEEL THIS PROBLEM SHOULD NOT HAPPEN SO SOON IN A VEHICLES LIFE, AND IS SO SAFETY RELATED, THAT CHEVROLET SHOULD REPAIR UNDER A RECALL, OR AT THEIR EXPENSE. I'VE NEVER HAD A STUCK ACCELERATOR PROBLEM AND I AM GLAD THE KIDS, AND MY WIFE MENTIONED IT.   IT DID STICK ON ONCE OR TWICE. I HAD FIXED WITHIN 2 DAYS.    *NLM",
