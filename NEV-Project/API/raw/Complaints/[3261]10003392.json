THE LOCAL DEALER TOOK MY VEHICLE & HAD IT FOR OVER A WEEK, FINALLY GETTING A CODE TO SHOW UP THAT ALLOWED THEM TO REPLACE THE INJECTOR PUMP. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE INJECTOR PUMP WAS AT FAULT, BUT INSTEAD THE PMD ELECTRONIC CONTROL MODULE WAS FAILING. THIS REPLACEMENT DIDN'T COST ME ANYTHING, BUT I THINK GM SHOULD EXTEND THE WARRANTY FOR A MUCH LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE OF THE KNOWN PROBLEM. THEY EXTENDED THE WARRANTY TO 120,000 MILES ON AN ENGINE THAT IS DESIGNED TO RUN 200,00+ MILES W/PROPER CARE. MY VEHICLE HAS APPROX. 50,000 MILES ON IT AT THIS TIME.",
