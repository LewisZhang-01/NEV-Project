        "summary": "FORD FOCUS BRAKE PADS AND ROTOR PROBLEMS SINCE 11,500 MILES ON VEHICLE, INSPECTED AND TOLD NOTHING WRONG, NORMAL SQUEEKING AND GRINDING. MY DAUGHTER FEELS THAT WHILE DRIVING THE CAR THE BRAKES ARE GRINDING AND GIVING UNDER HER. WE TAKE IT IN FOR THE 15K SERVICE AND THEY TELL US THE BRAKES ARE FINE AT 15,600 MILES INSPECTED AND TOLD NOTHING WRONG, NORMAL WITH CHANGE OF WEATHER. YESTERDAY MY DAUGHTER SAID THE BRAKES WERE NOT HOLDING AND WE TOOK THE CAR IN FOR A WHEEL BEARING RECALL FOR THE REAR BRAKE SYSTEM AND AT 18,000 MILES, DEALERSHIP SAYS BRAKE PADS AND ROTORS ARE COMPLETELY GONE! I HAVE TALKED TO THE DEALER AND FORD WHO SAY THEY WILL \"COVER\" THIS $400 REPAIR.  MY COMPLAINT IS THAT THIS SHOULD HAVE NEVER OCCURRED AND COULD HAVE COST MY DAUGHTER, MY SON WHO RIDES IN THE CAR OR ME OUR LIVES.  I FEEL THEY ARE VERY AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND CHOSE TO OVERLOOK THEIR RESPONSIBILITY THAT COULD HAVE COST MY FAMILY OUR LIVES.  SOMEONE NEEDS TO MAKE THEM ACCOUNTABLE INCLUDING THE DEALERSHIP WHO \"INSPECTED\" THE BRAKES AND CHOSE TO LIE TO US ON 2 OTHER OCCASSIONS. IF FORD HAS A PROBLEM THEN THE DEALERSHIPS ARE ONLY COMPOUNDING THE PROBLEM WITH THE POSSIBLITY OF LOSS OF LIFE.",
