        "summary": "MY 2011 SUBARU OUTBACK WAS BROUGHT IN FOR A TIRE CHANGE AND UPON RETURN, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE BRAKE LINES WERE COMPLETELY CORRODED AND LEAKING FLUID. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS WAS FOUND OUT AFTER I DROVE IT OUT OF THE SHOP AND I HAD NO ABILITY TO STOP WHATSOEVER. LUCKILY THE TRAFFIC IN THE AREA WAS LIGHT AND I WAS ABLE TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AFTER PUTTING THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL. THE BRAKE LINES WERE CORRODED BEYOND BELIEF IN THE CENTER OF THE CAR. COINCIDENTLY THIS ISSUE IS KNOWN AND RECALLS ALREADY OCCURRED IN 2014 WITH 660,000 SUBARUS. HOWEVER, MY SPECIFIC YEAR WAS NOT A PART OF THIS RECALL. THE REST OF THE UNDERCARRIAGE HAD MINIMAL CORROSIONS OR AT LEAST THE EXPECTED LEVEL AFTER 8 YEARS OF SERVICE. THE BRAKE LINES THEMSELVES HAD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CORROSION AND THIS COULD HAVE EASILY LEAD TO AN AWFUL ACCIDENT. THIS IS POOR ENGINEERING AND I BELIEVE THAT SUBARU IS TO BLAME. I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE AND SUBARU SEEMS UNSYMPATHETIC. THERE IS NO WAY A BRAKE LINE IN THE CENTER OF THE CAR SHOULD BECOME CORRODED SO QUICKLY. IT'S REASONABLE TO SAY THAT THE FRONT LEFT AND RIGHT OR BACK LEFT AND RIGHT LINES COULD HAVE BEEN PINCHED WHEN THE CAR TURNS, CREATING A LEAK OF SOME KIND. HOWEVER, THE CENTER OF THE CAR AND THE FITMENTS THAT PIECE THE BRAKE LINE TOGETHER WERE BEYOND SHOT. I FIND IT STRANGE THAT 2005-2009 OUTBACKS WERE COVERED UNDER THE RECALL BUT WHAT CHANGED WITH 2010 AND BEYOND? MY GUESS IS THAT I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHOS RAN INTO THE SAME ISSUE. THE POOR ENGINEERING WITH THIS MODEL IS MOST CERTAINLY A SAFETY CONCERN.",
