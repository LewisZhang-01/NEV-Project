        "summary": "FRONT ROTORS HAVE FAILED THREE TIMES WITHIN 60,000 AND NISSAN SAYS THAT THIS IS DUE TO DRIVING HABITS, I.E., ROTORS GET HOT AND THEN FAIL. REFERENCE # 4029350 PERJUDY EXT. 3773.  DEALER HAS REPLACED ROTORS EACH TIME AND I FIND NO FAULT WITH DEALER WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS CAUSING THIS; OTHER THAN THE DRIVING HABITS AS EXPRESSED BY THE NISSAN REP. JUDY.  THIS CONDITION IS DANGEROUS AND CAUSES THE CAR TO BE BOUNCE WITH LOSS OF CONTROL A VERY REAL POSSIBLITY. FOR THE SECOND REPLACEMENT, A STATEMENT IN THE FOLLOWUP TO NISSAN WAS MADE THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS SERIOUS. THIS VEHICLE IS NOT DRIVEN IN THE CITY OR UNDER CITY CONDITIONS  WHERE BRAKE PRESSURE OCCURS OFTEN; THE MILES ARE HIGHWAY MILES AS WE LIVE IN THE COUNTRY; WE HAVE A PAVED ROAD TO THE HOUSE SO ROAD CONDITIONS ARE NOT A FACTOR. THE RESPONSE BY NISSAN IS A \"RUN-AROUND\" WITH THE SAME VERBAGE AND REFLECTS THE NISSAN REP'S ATTTEMPT TO DEFUSE ANY COMPLAINT. IN LOOKING AT THE OFFICE OF DEFECTS INVESTIGATIONS, THERE ARE SEVERAL REFERENCES TO ROTOR FAILURE: NISSAN SAID THAT THEY WERE UNAWARE OF ANY PROBLEMS. IN FACT, THE NISSAN DEALER (ANCIRA-SAN ANTONIO, TX) INDICATED THAT I SHOULD CONTACT NISSAN CONCERNING THIS SITUATION. I DID AND AM NOT SATISFIED THE LEAST WITH THEIR RUNAROUND AS I BELIEVE THIS TO BE A SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS CONDITION OF AT LEAST THE VEHICLE WHICH WE HAVE.",
