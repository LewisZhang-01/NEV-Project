IT WILL MOVE FORWARD AT A SLOW PACE BUT THEN DOESN'T GO AS FAST AS I'M PRESSING THE GAS PEDAL, EVEN THOUGH MY RPMS ARE INCREASING.  THIS HAS ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE THE CAR DOES NOT PERFORM AS IT SHOULD.  HAPPENED TODAY FOR PROBABLY THE 10TH TIME SINCE I'VE HAD THE CAR, LESS THAN A MONTH.  PULLING OUT OF A PARKING LOT ONTO THE STREET, MY CAR MOVE'S FORWARD VERY SLOWLY THEN WHEN I GO TO INCREASE MY SPEED THE CAR DOESN'T GO FASTER.",
