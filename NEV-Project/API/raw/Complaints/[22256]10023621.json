IN A MATTER OF SECONDS I WAS BLINDED. IT WAS VERY SCARY! I WAS VERY LUCKY WHEN CROSSING THE LANES OF TRAFFIC TO GET TO THE SHOULDER OF THE INTERSTATE THAT I DID NOT KILL SOMEONE ELSE OR MYSELF.  NOT TO MENTION DODGING THE CAR PARKED ON THE SIDE OF THE INTERSTATE.    ON ANOTHER INCIDENT BACK IN JANUARY WHEN I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE, MY WIPERS QUIT WHILE IT WAS SLEETING.  INSTANTLY THE WINDSHIELD WAS FROZEN OVER.    AT OTHER TIMES THE WIPERS WILL NOT COME ON AND SOMETIMES THEY WILL NOT TURN OFF.  *JB",
