CAR DEALERSHIPS PAPERS SAYS THAT I HAVE 10 DAYS TO SHOW PROOF OF INSURANCE TO THEM. THE CAR DEALERSHIP ALSO SAYS THAT THEY DO/DID NOT COVER CAR FOR 10 DAY, AND I STILL AM FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CAR. I WAS NOT GIVEN CITATION CONCERNING THE ACCIDENT. THE HIT & SKIP DRIVER PUSHED MY CAR INTO ANOTHER CAR. IS THE DEALERSHIP LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE TO COVER THE CAR DURING THIS 10 DAY PERIOD? I AM WILLING TO WORK WITH THE DEALERSHIP BUT I DO NOT FEEL THAT I SHOULD BE TOTALLY FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE DUE TO ONLY OWNING THE CAR FOR 24 HOURS.  *NLM",
