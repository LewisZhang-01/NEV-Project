WHILE DRIVING IN THE RAIN ONE DAY, I HAD SET THE CONTROLS TO DE-FOG THE WINDSHIELD, ONLY TO MAKE THE SCENARIO MUCH WORSE DUE TO ABSENCE OF HOT AIR NEEDED TO DEHUMIDIFY THE INTERIOR. VISIBILITY FROM WINDSHIELD WAS GREATLY REDUCED AND COULD HAVE VERY EASILY RESULTED IN AN ACCIDENT. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN NOTED MULTIPLE TIMES THROUGH OTHER SOURCES. AFTER CALLING NISSAN TO EXPLAIN THE ISSUE, THE REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT A RECALL HAD BEEN PERFORMED IN DECEMBER OF 2011. ALTHOUGH I CAN FIND NO EVIDENCE OF THE RECALL, OTHER THAN THROUGH NISSAN ITSELF, I CAN SAY THAT THE PART THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPAIRED IS NO LONGER IN OPERATION, AND CONTINUES TO BE A RISK.",
