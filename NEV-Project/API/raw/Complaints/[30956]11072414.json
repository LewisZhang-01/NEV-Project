I NOTICED THE AC WAS NOT BLOWING AS COOL AS IT NORMALLY DOES, THEN I STARTED TO NOTICE A LOUD HISSING NOISE IN THE CABIN WHENEVER THE AC WAS TURNED ON. TOOK THE SUV TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THE CONDENSER HAD A PIN HOLE LEAK AND IT COULDN'T BE REPAIRED, THE WHOLE CONDENSER HAD TO BE REPLACED. I WAS QUOTED OVER 1K FOR THE REPAIR BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY IN ACCESSING THE PART IN THE ENGINE BAY. I WAS TOLD THE WHOLE FRONT BUMPER AND THE FRONT SIDE BODY PANEL HAD TO BE REMOVED IN ORDER TO REPLACE THE CONDENSER. I LOOKED THE OEM PART UP ONLINE AND IT HAD A PRICE OF $140-$210. THE SUV JUST PASSED 50,000 MILES, NO ACCIDENTS OR OTHER PREVIOUS ISSUES.",
