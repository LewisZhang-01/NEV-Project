TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND  IT WAS A SHORTED WIRING HARNESS.  THEY REPLACED IT AND ALL WORKED FINE.      MY COMPLAINT IS THAT GM KNOWS THIS IS A PROBLEM AND DOES NOT FIX IT.  IF IT HAD BEEN OUT OF WARRANTY, I WOULD HAVE HAD TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR.  THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM COULD HAVE CAUSED A FIRE, # 1 SAFETY PROBLEM.  #2 SAFETY PROBLEM IS THAT NOW I WAS WITHOUT A HEADLIGHT AND HAD TO GET IT TO A DEALER TO GET IT BACK.  NOT ALL OF US LIVE CLOSE TO DEALERS, WE ARE 50 MILES FROM THE NEAREST. *TR",
