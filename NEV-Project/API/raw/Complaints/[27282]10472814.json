UPON INSPECTION IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT A HYDRAULIC SUSPENSION HOSE RUPTURED AND SPRAYED FLUID ONTO A CATALYTIC CONVERTER. THIS RESULTED IN A LARGE AMOUNT OF SMOKE AND SMALL FLAMES STARTING TO APPEAR RIGHT BEFORE THE PASSENGER SIDE ENGINE BAY WAS HOSED DOWN WITH WATER.    THE MERCEDES DEALERSHIP ADVISED THIS WAS A KNOWN ISSUE AND A RECALL WAS ISSUED/PERFORMED BACK IN 2005/2007. MERCEDES ADVISED ME NO FURTHER WORK WOULD BE DONE UNDER THE RECALL.    I AM REPORTING THIS TO NHTSA AS THIS IS A DANGEROUS SAFETY RELATED RECURRING DEFECT REPORTED ON MANY WEBSITES/FORUMS, YET MERCEDES REFUSES TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION TO PERMANENTLY RESOLVE IT.  *TR",
