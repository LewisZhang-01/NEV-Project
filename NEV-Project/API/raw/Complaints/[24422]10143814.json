        "summary": "MY HUSBAND AND I BOUGHT A NEW 2001 CHRYSLER VOYAGER MINIVAN IN APRIL OF 2001.  AS OF 11/10/05 THERE WAS 51,000 MILES ON OUR 4 YEAR OLD VAN.  WE TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE WE BOUGHT IT FOR ALL SERVICING.  WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS UNTIL 11/10/05.  MY HUSBAND WAS JUST DRIVING DOWN THE STREET ON HIS WAY HOME WHEN THE DRIVER'S SEAT FRAME BROKE IN HALF AND LANDED IN THE BACK SEAT!  THANKFULLY HE DID NOT GET IN AN ACCIDENT ALTHOUGH THE FRAME BREAKING DID AGGRAVATE A PREVIOUS BACK INJURY.  WE HAD TO USE OUR \"CLUB\" (ANTI-THEFT DEVICE) TO PROP UP THE SEAT TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE THE VAN TO THE DEALERSHIP THE NEXT DAY.  UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY (WE HAD AN EXTENDED WARRANTY).  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THE DEALERSHIP SAID IT WOULD BE $1200-$1500 FOR PARTS ALONE FOR THE \"MECHANISM\"??  OUR SEATS ARE MANUAL SEATS...IT WAS THE FRAME THAT BROKE IN HALF!!!  NEEDLESS TO SAY WE WILL NEVER BUY A CHRYSLER PRODUCT AGAIN!!  WE TRADED THAT VAN IN THAT DAY AND BOUGHT A NEW TOYOTA VEHICLE.  WE ONLY HAD THE ONE VEHICLE AND NEEDED SOMETHING DRIVABLE AND RELIABLE THAT DAY!!!   WE COULD POSSIBLY SEE SOMETHING MECHANICAL BREAKING DOWN...BUT A DRIVER'S SEAT TO BREAK IN HALF WHILE YOU ARE DRIVING???   THAT IS SO TOTALLY DANGEROUS AND DEFINITELY UNEXPECTED!!!  *NM",
