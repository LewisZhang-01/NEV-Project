WHEN MY STICK SHIFT BROKE (ONE PIECE BECAME TWO PIECES).  I WAS FORTUNATE THAT NO ACCIDENT HAPPENED, I WAS FURTHER BLESSED THAT I WAS ABLE TO COAST AT HIGHWAY SPEED (CAR WENT TO NEUTRAL) UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO MOVE FROM THE MIDDLE LANE TO THE SLOWER RIGHT HAND LANE.  AT THIS POINT I CONTINUED ON WITH FLASHERS AND WAS ABLE TO PUT THE CAR IN THIRD GEAR, BUT THE STICK SHIFT REMAINED BROKEN.  I HAVE ASKED APPROXIMATELY 50 PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE EVER HEARD OF SUCH A MALFUNCTION.  NONE HAD!   I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE DEALING WITH ONLY VW PEOPLE CONCERNING THE ACCEPTIBILITY OF THIS PROBLEM.  I CONTACTED USAA AND THEY RECOMMENDED THAT I GET YOUR GROUP INVOLVED.  THANK YOU",
