ON NOV 20, 2001, I WAS TURNING LEFT AT AN INTERSECTION WHEN THE BOUNCING REAR WHEEL LOST TRACTION AND SLID SIDEWAYS. MY BIKE TIPPED OVER, CRASHED AND SLID ON THE GROUND. MY LEFT HAND, ARM, AND LEFT LEG WERE INJURED. BIKE NEEDED REPAIRS TO HANDLEBARS, PEGS, TURN SIGNALS.  SINCE THEN, I HAVE HAD THE TIRES BALANCED 3 TIMES, PURCHASED A NEW REAR TIRE.  YET I AM *STILL* EXPERIENCING THE BOUNCING PROBLEM!  I'VE FOUND OUT FROM OTHER OWNERS THAT THIS REAR WHEEL BOUNCING PROBLEM OCCURS VERY FREQUENTLY ON THEIR SPIRIT 750 MOTORCYCLES AS WELL!",
