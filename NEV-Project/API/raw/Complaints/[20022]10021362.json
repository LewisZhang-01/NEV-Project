I PULLED OFF THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY. THE TRANSMISSION WAS SLIPPING AND NOT SHIFTING CORRECTLY. I WAS ABLE TO GET MY CARAVAN TO QUIGLEY MOTORS WHICH IS THE LOCAL DODGE DEALERSHIP. THE DIAGNOSIS WAS 3RD GEAR WAS TOTALLY DESTROYED AND THEY FOUND ALOT OF METAL FRAGMENTS IN THE PAN. IT'S GOING TO COST ME $2500. TO FIX IT. THE CHRYSLER CORPORATION NEEDS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A WELL DOCUMENTED PROBLEM WITH THIS TRANSMISSION AND SHOULD RECTIFY THE SITUATION. IT IS MY FIRST CHRYSLER VEHICLE AND IT WILL PROBABLY WILL BE MY LAST. THE SERVICE THAT I RECEIVED AT QUIGLEY MOTORS WAS HORRENDOUS. MY VAN WAS THERE AN ENTIRE WEEK BEFORE THEY COULD GET IT IN TO GIVE ME A REPAIR ESTIMATE.  5 STAR SERVICE??? I DON'T THINK SO!*AK",
