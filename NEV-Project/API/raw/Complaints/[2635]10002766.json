        "summary": "I AM DEEPLY DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE STEEING ON MY 2001 LEXUS GS300 AND I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR A YEAR. IT IS SO LOOSE IT IS ALMOST SCARY. I CAN TURN IT ALMOST A HALF TURN AT SAY 5 MPH WITH ALMOST NO CHANGE IN DIRECTION OF THE CAR, THAT AND THE FACT THAT I CAN DO THIS WITH ONE FINGER ON THE WHEEL.    I'VE HAD AN INCIDENT, WHERE I LOST CONTROL OF THE STEERING (SHAKING STEERING WHEEL) AND CAUSE ME TO HIT THE CURB ON A LOCAL STREET.  I HAVE BEEN READING THE POSTS ON CLUBLEXUS ABOUT THE L-TUNED STEERING ECU AND FIGURED THAT HAD TO BE A SOLUTION (EVEN THOUGH HALF THE POSTS ONLY SAY IT AFFECTS HIGH SPEED FEEL).    HOWEVER, I RAN INTO A FRIEND TODAY WITH A 2000 GS400. I TEST DROVE HIS CAR AND THE DIFFERENCE WAS AMAZING (AND WE BOTH HAVE THE EXACT SAME 17\" TIRES). HIS STEERING WAS FIRM AND DIRECT AND IS COMPLETELY STOCK WITHOUT THE L-TUNED ECU.    NOW MY QUESTION -  HOW IN THE WORLD AM I GOING TO CONVINCE MY DEALER THAT I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH MY CAR'S STEERING? I KNOW THERE IS AN ADJUSTMENT THAT CAN BE MADE, BUT FROM OTHER POSTS IT SEEMS AS IF DEALERS ARE RELUCTANT TO DO THIS.",
