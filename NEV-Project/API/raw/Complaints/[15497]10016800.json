BOTH FAILURES WERE OF THE  PLASTIC RETAINER FOR THE CABLE END WHICH HOLDS THE WINDOW UP.  BOTH WINDOWS DROPPED SEVERAL INCHES. THE REAR WINDOW DROPPED WHILE DRIVING, CAUSING DRIVER DISTRACTION. IN BOTH CASES THE WINDOW COULD NOT BE RAISED WITHOUT REMOVING THE DOOR UPHOLSTERY PANEL. THE ONLY REPAIR IS TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE WINDOW REGULATOR ASSEMBLY.
