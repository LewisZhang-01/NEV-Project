AFTER THIS HAPPENED, THERE WAS NO PRESSURE LEFT IN THE PEDAL - IT WENT NEARLY TO THE FLOOR EACH TIME I HAD TO STOP.  I WAS SO SCARED THAT I MIGHT NOT STOP ALL THE WAY, FOR MY WHOLE TRIP HOME - 20 MILES - WITH THE SNOW GETTING WORSE AND MY SON IN THE CAR.  WE WERE BOTH TERRIFIED.  SEEMS FINE NOW, BUT I ENDED UP TAKING THE CAR TO A MECHANIC, WHO LOOKED THROUGH THE WHOLE SYSTEM AND COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. THIS WAS A $100 COST FOR INSPECTION....",
