ON NEW MODEL THERE IS A CLIP TO LOCATE THE LINE AWAY FROM OTHER PARTS.  A CHECK OF A FRIENDS CAR SHOWS WEAR TO THE PLASTIC COVER ALSO.  SINCE THIS COULD CAUSE A FIRE, I THINK CARS SHOULD BE CHECKED FOR WEAR AND REPAIRED BY CHRYSLER.   *JB    ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****760343***",
