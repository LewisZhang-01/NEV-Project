THIS IS AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM WITH THE SEAT BELT THAT WE HAVE BEEN HAVING AND NOTIFIED OUR FORD DEALER (WINNER FORD, CHERRY HILL, NJ) ABOUT ON OUR 25000 SERVICE.  THE SERVICE REP TESTED THE SEAT BELT LATCH WITH A TESTER AND FOUND NO PROBLEMS.    I WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NOT REPLACE THE SEAT BELT LATCH BECAUSE FORD WOULD CHARGE THEM FOR THE PART.  HE SAID THEY WOULD CHECK IT AGAIN IF WE HAD ANY MORE PROBLEMS.  WE CONTINUE TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE BELT LATCH COMING UNDONE WHILE DRIVING.  THERE IS NO AMOUNT OF TUGGING THAT WILL CAUSE IT TO FAIL, THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT.  WINNER FORD HAS NOT SENT OUT OUR SERVICE SHEET WITH THE SEAT BELT PROBLEM REPORTED ON IT.  IT HAS BEEN SINCE 4/17/2003, AND THEN AGAIN SERVICING ON 4/24/2003 AND NO PAPERWORK FROM THE DEALER WITH THE PROBLEM REPORTED BY ME AND NO REMEDY FOR THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SAFETY PROBLEM.           *JB     RQ04011.*PCO",
