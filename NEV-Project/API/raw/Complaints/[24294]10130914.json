NEARLY LOST CONTROL AROUND A 90 DEGREE BEND. SECOND TIME OCCURRED  JUNE 9TH, 2005  AT 83,000 MILES AFTER TURNING OFF A HIGHWAY. THIRD TIME IT OCCURRED WAS JULY 15TH, 2005.  I WAS IDLING AND ATTEMPTED TO PUT IT IN DRIVE TO PROCEED FORWARD. I HAD IT TOWED TWICE IN THREE DAYS TO DEALER. EACH TIME, THE SENSOR WAS REPLACED. THE LAST TWO TIMES THE CRANK BLADE WAS ALSO REPLACED. NONE OF THE TIMES DID I EXPECT THERE TO BE ANY PROBLEMS WITH DRIVING THE VEHICLE. NOW I AM WORRIED A LOT. THE SECOND TIME, I COULD TELL IT WAS HAPPENING SINCE THE RPM NEEDLE DROPPED TO ZERO AND THEN IT SHUT OFF.",
