DROVE DOWN THE ROAD A 1/2 BLOCK AND CAR STOPPED AGAIN, DEAD IN ROAD, NO STEERING, COULD NOT OPERATE DOOR LOCKS OR ANYTHING.   CAR STARTED AGAIN AND MANAGED TO MOVE THE CAR TO A SAFE SPOT BEFORE IT WENT OUT AGAIN.  NOTHING WAS WORKABLE.  WHEN THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO  CHEVROLET DEALER IN LLANO, TX IT WAS DIAGNOSED AS  THE POSITIVE CONNECTION TO THE MAIN FUSE BOX HAD COME LOOSE.  THE ONLY FIX WAS COMPLETE REPLACEMENT OF THE FUSE BOX ASSEMBLY BECAUSE THE MAIN POSITIVE LUG TO THE FUSE BOX IS ONLY HELD ON BY PLASTIC.  THE DESIGN OF THIS FUSE BOX IS DEFINITELY POOR CREATING THE POSSIBILITY OF A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION.  HAD I BEEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED WHEN THIS OCCURRED, THE OUTCOME COULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS CAUSING AN ACCIDENT AND POSSIBLE DEATH.  THIS POORLY DESIGNED FUSE BOX WITH MAIN LUG NUT HELD BY ONLY PLASTIC  NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY TO PREVENT FUTURE ACCIDENTS AND POSSIBLE DEATH TO OCCUPANTS OF THE VEHICLE.  *TR",
