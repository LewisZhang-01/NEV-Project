DRIVER DETECTED SEPARATION IMMEDIATELY AND WAS ABLE TO STOP VEHICLE BEFORE DEFLATION OCCURRED.  TIRE STILL HAD THE REQUIRED INFLATION OF 80# FOR THE CAMPER THAT WAS ON THE TRUCK.  TIRE WAS THEN CHANGED AND TAKEN TO THE NEAREST DEALER FOR REPLACEMENT.  TIRE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE NO ROAD DAMAGE LEADING TO THE TREAD SEPARATION AND TIRE PRESSURE HAD NOT BEEN AN ISSUE.  TIRE STILL HAD WELL OVER HALF OF THE TREAD REMAINING.  THE TIRE WAS THE FOLLOWING:  STEELTEX RADIAL A/T LT245/75R16 LOAD E DA807T-C22D E4 DOT VN11 BAC 008009008009.  WE HAD TO BUY ANOTHER TIRE TO RETURN HOME FROM OUR VACATION.  IS THIS ON OF THE RECALLED SERIES OF TIRES, AND SHOULD WE HAVE THE OTHER THREE REPLACED ALSO?   *JB",
