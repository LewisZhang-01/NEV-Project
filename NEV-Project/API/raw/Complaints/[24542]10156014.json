        "summary": "I HAVE A 1998 LINCOLN NAVIGATOR WITH 39K MILES. ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE IS 8 YEARS OLD IT ONLY HAS 39K MILES WHICH MAKES IT A \"NEW\" VEHICLE BY ANY STANDARDS. SINCE THIS IS THE 1ST MODEL YEAR, THE VEHICLE WAS MADE WITH INFERIOR THREADING TO THE CYLINDER HEAD. THIS HAS CAUSED THE SPARK PLUG TO EXPLODE AND CAUSED DAMAGES TO IGNITION COIL, HELI COIL AND INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET. THE THREADING IN THE 1999 MODEL WAS RECTIFIED BY LINCOLN BY ADDING ADDITIONAL THREADING. THIS IMPROVEMENT INSINUATES THAT LINCOLN WAS AWARE THAT THIS WAS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, THEY HAVE FAILED TO RE-CALL THE 1ST YEAR MODELS AND THIS FAILURE HAS CAUSED ME AUTOMOBILE PROBLEMS AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT MONETARY LOSS.  *NM",
