        "summary": "WHILE TRAVELING AT 50MPH DOWN A BUSY STREET DURING MY MORNING RUSH HOUR COMMUTE, THE VEHICLE CUT OFF ALL POWER AND WENT INTO \"PRE-SAFE MODE\" WHICH IS COMMONLY KNOWN AS \"LIMP HOME MODE.\"  WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE DRIVER HAS NO ABILITY TO ACCELERATE AND IF THE DRIVER IS UNABLE TO PULL OVER IN A SAFE AREA, PUTS THEM AT EXTREMELY HIGH RISK OF SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH MANY MERCEDES BENZ VEHICLES THAT ARE EQUIPPED WITH ESP (TRACTION CONTROL).  A SIMPLE GOOGLE SEARCH OF THIS ISSUE WILL VALIDATE THIS AS A WIDESPREAD MAJOR DESIGN FLAW IN MERCEDES BENZ PRODUCTS.  PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK INTO THIS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS PROBLEM, AS MANY OTHER MERCEDES OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCE THIS IN MORE DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES (ON THE HIGHWAY).",
