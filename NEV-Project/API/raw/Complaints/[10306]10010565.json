WHETHER THEY ALWAYS DID OR IT WAS NOT NOTICED BECAUSE I DIDN'T LOOK INTO THEM WHILE BACKING.  ABOUT 5 MONTHS AGO I OCCASIONALLY NOTICED MY SIDE MIRRORS BEING MISAIMED.  IT WAS MOST DISCONCERTING, TO SAY THE LEAST TO SEE THE ROAD SURFACE WHEN I LOOKED IN THE SIDE MIRROR.  APPARENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME THE MIRRORS SWUNG DOWN WHEN I HAD PUT THE CAR INTO REVERSE, AS THEY SHOULD.  UNFORTUNATELY, THEY DID NOT SWING BACK UP WHEN I PUT THE CAR INTO FORWARD.  CLEARLY, THIS CREATES AN UNSAFE CONDITION.   *NLM",
