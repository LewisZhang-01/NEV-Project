HE REPLACED ALL COILS AND PLUGS AND RESTARTED VEHICLE BUT IT STILL MISFIRED ON CYLINDER 3 (C).HE TESTED THE WIRE SENDING SPARK TO THAT COIL AND THERE WAS NO SPARK . THE PCM WAS DETERMINED TO BE BAD. NOW I'M FINDING OUT THAT IT WAS A FACTORY DEFECT BUT MINE WAS 3 MONTHS OLDER THAN THE 8 YEAR PERIOD  ALLOWED BY FORD TO REPAIR FOR FREE. ONLY 40,000 MILES AND THE COMPUTER GOES TO AND COSTS OVER 1000.00 DOLLARS TO FIX IT. NOT FAIR.  *TR",
