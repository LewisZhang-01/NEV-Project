NOW IT TURNS ON WITH OR WITHOUT A PERSON SO I'M STARTING TO THINK THAT THE DRIVERS SIDE IS MALFUNCTIONING TOO. IN ADDITIONAL THE SEATBELT LIGHT IS TURNING ON TOO NOW. THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING. I TALKED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY INDICATED THAT IT IS THE AIRBAG AND SEAT SENSORS THAT HAVE MALFUNCTIONED. EACH TO FIX IS OVER $500. THEY ALSO INDICATED THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR OWNERS AND TO WAIT FOR A SUPPOSABLY RECALL LETTER. HOWEVER, THAT WAS A YEAR AGO AND I NOW HAVE THE AIRBAG AND SEATBELT LIGHT GOING OFF. I'VE ALSO COME ACROSS MANY BMW FORUMS (OWNERS) TALKING ABOUT THEIR FRUSTRATION WITH THESE SAME ISSUES. IT'S SURPRISING THAT THE DEALERSHIPS ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE BUT YET NOTHING IS BEING RESOLVED. THERE HAS TO BE A REMEDY FOR THIS ANNOYANCE AND LACK OF ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BY BMW. IF ANYTHING THERE HAS TO BE SOME REPERCUSSIONS ON BMW'S PART SINCE THE CONSUMERS ARE HAVING TO DEAL WITH THESE PROBLEM FOR WHAT SEEMS TO BE YEARS NOW.",
