        "summary": "MY 2010 PRIUS WAS \"REPAIRED\" LAST MONTH. IT INTERMITTENTLY ACCELERATES WITHOUT MY PROMPTING AFTER HITTING A BUMP. THIS ACCELERATION IS AS INTENSE AS THE CAR SEEMS TO ALLOW, AS IF THE PEDAL WERE TO THE FLOOR OR WORSE, AND PERSISTS FOR AT LEAST ONE SECOND AND HAS NOT SUBSIDED SINCE THE ABS ACTUATOR ECU WAS UPDATED IN THE RECALL APPOINTMENT. THIS ACCELERATION IS TERRIFYING AS IT CAN'T BE ANTICIPATED AS IT DOES NOT HAPPEN EVERY TIME I HIT A BUMP, AND CAN'T BE SUPPRESSED BY THE BRAKING SYSTEM. I HAVE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BEEN SAFELY COASTING TO A STOP WITH THE BRAKES ON AND EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM. IN A FEW CASES THIS ACCELERATION ALMOST CAUSED ME TO HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME AT STOP LIGHTS. I NEVER DID EXPERIENCE THE SYMPTOMS DESCRIBED BY TOYOTA RELATING TO THE DELAYED BRAKING PROBLEM, BUT I FEAR THIS PROBLEM AS MUCH OR MORE. *TR",
