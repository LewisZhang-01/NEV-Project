RECENTLY, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, THE ERROR CODE SHOWED A BAD BAROMETRIC PRESSURE SENSOR. I REPLACED IT AND COULDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM. A SHOP REPLACED IT AGAIN AND THE ERROR CODE WAS STILL THERE. THEY FINALLY DIAGNOZED A BAD ECU. I HAVE HEARD A LOT OF COMPLAINS ABOUT THE EARLY 90S MITSUBISHI GALANT ECU AND HAVE KNOWN AT LEAST TWO OTHER PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME ISSUE. ONE OF MY FRIENDS HAD THE SAME CAR BEFORE, AND THE CAR WAS TOTALLY DEAD ON THE HIGHWAY BECAUSE OF THE ECU FAILURE. FORTUNATELY HE WAS NOT INJURED. HOWEVER, IT'S DEFINITELY A SEVERE ISSUE. I KNOW ANOTHER GUY HAS THE SAME CAR WHEN I AM DOING THE REPAIR. HE HAD A BAD ECU TOO. I AM WONDERING IF YOU HAVE RECEIVED SIMILAR COMPLAINS REGARDING THE ECU.",
