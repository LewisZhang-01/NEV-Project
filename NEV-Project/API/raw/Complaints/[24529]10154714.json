        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING DOWN I-75, MY 1999 CONCORDE BEGAN MAKING NOISE THAT SOUNDED SIMILAR TO AN OBJECT TOUCHING A MOVING FAN. WHEN I GOT TO FIRST EXIT, VEHICLE DIED, AND AT THAT POINT OIL LIGHT FLICKERED. I RESTARTED AND BEFORE I COULD GET ACROSS 1 LANE OF TRAFFIC TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD I THOUGHT THAT FROM THE SOUND MY WHOLE ENGINE WOULD FALL OUT OF MY VEHICLE. CAR DIED AGAIN,AS I MANAGED TO REACH THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. HAD IT TOWED TO DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THE ENGINE HAD \"THROWN A ROD\", AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. I ASKED WHAT WOULD CAUSE IT AND WAS TOLD \"EVERYDAY WEAR AND TEAR\", IT HAS ONLY 70,000 MILES ON IT. IT WILL COST $5,000.00 TO REPLACE, WHICH I DON'T HAVE!!! I HAVE SPOKEN TO VERY RELIABLE AUTO PARTS DEALER ABOUT A REPLACEMENT ENGINE. HE TOLD ME THAT THE ENGINE HAS A REPUTATION FOR BEING THE WORST YOU COULD HAVE, AND THAT HE WOULD NOT PUT ANOTHER 2.7 LITER ENGINE BACK IN THE CAR. (DIDN'T MAKE ME FEEL ANY BETTER!!) NOW I FIND THIS WEBSITE AND I READ 64 COMPLAINTS WITH THE SAME ISSUE. IS THERE A PLACE OR PHONE NUMBER TO SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP WITH THIS PROBLEM. AS IT STANDS NOW, I HAVE A CAR THAT I CAN'T DRIVE, BUT STILL HAVE TO PAY $7,000 ON, AND NO PROSPECTS OF BEING ABLE TO AFFORD ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION. *JB",
