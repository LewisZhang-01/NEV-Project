DEALER INDICATED THAT SEVERAL OTHER JETTAS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  OTHER VW OWNERS (PASSAT) INDICATED SIMILAR PROBLEMS.  OTHER DEALERS INDICATE SIMILAR PROBLEMS AND LONG WAIT TIMES.      I SEE FROM OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE THAT THIS PROBLEM IS EPIDEMIC IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AS WELL.    THE REPEATED AND UNEXPECTED FAILURE OF THE IGNITION COILS IS AN INCREDIBLY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE FOR THE DRIVERS OF THESE VEHICLES AS WELL AS ANYONE ELSE ON THE HIGHWAY.  THESE COILS FAIL WITHOUT WARNING - THE SECOND ONE FAILED WHILE I WAS HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM HOME ON A VERY LONELY STRETCH OF THE WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS TURNPIKE (NO CELL PHONE SERVICE OF COURSE) EARLY IN THE MORNING IN A SNOWSTORM!",
