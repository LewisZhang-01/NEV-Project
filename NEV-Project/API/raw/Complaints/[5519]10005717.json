        "summary": "FAILURE OF SUZUKI MOTORCYCLE TO REPLACE DEFECTIVE PISTONS IN 2001-2002 SUZUKI BANDIT MOTORCYCLES (GSF 1200).  THEY ISSUED A TSB SAYING THEY WOULD DO SO IF THE MOTORCYCLE BURNED MORE THAN 1 QUART IN 600 (NOT A MISPRINT) MILES. THAT'S ALMOST A GALLON BETWEEN OIL CHANGES RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.  PLEASE SEE SUZUKI TSB #129.  I BELIEVE THAT AT THAT RATE OF CONSUMPTION ENGINE SEIZURE AT SPEED COULD BECOME AN ISSUE RESULTING IN INJURY AND DEATH TO THE RIDER.
