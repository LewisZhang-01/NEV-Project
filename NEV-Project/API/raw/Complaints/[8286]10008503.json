        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING MY 5-YEAR-OLD SON HOME FROM SCHOOL. AFTER MORE THAN HALF OF THE STOPS, UPON ACCELERATION, THE CAR'S ENGINE WOULD RACE UP TO AS HIGH AS 7,000 RPMS. WHILE MAINTAINING 45 MPH ON SURFACE STREETS, THE CAR WOULD DOWN SHIFT ERRATICALLY, AS IF I HAD SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES SUDDENLY FOR NO APPARENT REASON. LUCKILY, WE LIVE IN ARIZONA, WHERE THE LANDSCAPE IS FLAT AND THE WEATHER IS WARM YEAR-ROUND. ACCORDING TO ACURA CLIENT SERVICES, COLD WEATHER AND UPHILL/DOWNHILL DRIVING COULD INSTIGATE THE TROUBLE WE'VE HAD. THEY'LL NEED TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING BETTER THAN THAT FOR US. WE HAVE OWNED HONDA VEHICLES SINCE 1989, SO FOR THE PAST 14 YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN LOYAL. NOW, THE PRICIEST PURCHASE IS WHAT I WOULD CALL A LEMON, SINCE WE ARE NOW WITHOUT A CAR FOR AT LEAST A WEEK AND THEY ARE REPLACING THE ENTIRE TRANSMISSION WITH A REFURBISHED ONE. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. PLUS, NO RECALL WAS EVER ISSUED? WHY NOT? ARE WE THE 2% OF THE ACURA-BUYING POPULATION THAT DOES NOT MATTER? ALL I KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT IF WE OWED THE AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR COMPANY SOMETHING, THEY'D BE ALL OVER US LIKE WHITE ON RICE. WHAT ABOUT THE LITTLE GUY? WHO'S GOING TO GIVE US WHAT WE DESERVE? NOT MR. YAKAMIKIMOTO-SON LIVING LARGE OVER THERE IN CALIFORNIA. *JB",
