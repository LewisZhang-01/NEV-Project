WHEN THE SPEED CONTROL MODULE GOES OUT, YOU ARE LEFT WITH ONLY 1ST AND REVERSE.  ACCORDING TO THE SERVICE TECH AT HEMET CHRYSLER, IT HAPPENS MORE THAN IT SHOULD.  IF IT GOES OUT WHILE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, IT IMMEDIATELY SHIFTS THE CAR INTO 1ST AND YOU ALMOST COME TO AN ABRUPT HALT.  NO ACCIDENT, BUT IT COULD RESULT IN ONE IN HEAVY TRAFFIC AND WOULD PROBABLY HIT IN THE REAR WITH THE SUDDEN DECELERATION IN  SPEED. *JB",
