TOOK VEHICLE TO DEALER AND THEY CANNOT FIND THE PROBLEM.  THEY SAY IT NEEDS BRAKES BUT I HAD THE BRAKES CHECKED BY A MECHANIC AND I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT THE PROBLEM.  HE TOLD ME TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE DEALER.  I THOUGHT IT COULD BE THE CALIPERS OR SOMETHING IN THE BRAKING SYSTEM.  THE VEHICLE IS MAKING PINGING NOISES AND PULLING TO THE RIGHT.  IT WILL INDEED CAUSE ANOTHER ACCIDENT UNLESS IT IS RESOLVED.",
