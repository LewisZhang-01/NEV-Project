FOR SOMEONE THAT KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT CARS, A CATALYTIC CONVERTER SHOULD NOT BE GOING OUT THIS SOON. AS I READ NUMEROUS FORUMS AND ARTICLES ONLINE, MANY OTHERS HAVE REPORTED THE SAME ISSUES WITH THEIR 8TH GENERATION ACCORD, YET HONDA HAS NOT BEEN TOLD TO ISSUE A RECALL. OBVIOUSLY THESE CONVERTERS WERE POORLY MADE AND IT IS GOING TO COST NEARLY 1000$ TO FIX THIS.",
