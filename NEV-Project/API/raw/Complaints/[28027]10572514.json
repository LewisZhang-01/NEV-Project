        "summary": "MY FAMILY AND I WERE ON OUR WAY TO DISNEY WORLD IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA WHEN MY 2011 FORD 3.5 LITER ECOBOOST F150 TRUCK COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN ON THE INTERSTATE 10 HIGHWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, PROBABLY 60 MILES TO THE EAST OF TALLAHASSEE FLORIDA.  AT FIRST I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT, AS THE TRUCK COMPLETELY DIED OUT. I PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE AND FINALLY GOT THE VEHICLE STARTED. WE HAD BEEN STEADY STATE CRUISING WITH THE CRUISE SET AT 70 FOR ATLEAST 2-2.5 HOURS. AFTER DOING SOME READING I SEE THAT IT WAS PROBABLY CONDENSATION IN THE INTERCOOLER THAT ENTERED THE INTAKE TRACT WHEN I HAD ACCELERATED TO GO AROUND A BIG TRUCK THAT WAS BARELY MAKING IT UP A HILL ON INTERSTATE 10. THIS WAS A REAL BAD EXPERIENCE, THIS HAS HAPPENED ATLEAST 2 TIMES SINCE THEN. LUCKILY I HAVE NOT HAD A WRECK OR CRASHED, BUT AS I KEEP READING UP, I SEE MANY PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE ECOBOOST F150. NOW, I HAVE A TRUCK IN THE SHOP WITH A BLOWN MOTOR, AND I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THAT THE WATER GETTING INTO THE MOTOR AND THE MOTOR TRYING TO COMPRESS THAT WATER WAS WHAT CAUSED MY ENGINE FAILURE. I METAL FROM THE INTERNAL ROTATING ASSEMBLY SHOOT THROUGH THE SIDE OF MY ENGINE BLOCK LAST WEEK. I BELIEVE THAT HAPPENED DUE TO THE WATER AND THE WATER BENDING THE CONNECTING RODS.  PLEASE HELP.  *TR",
