IT HARDENS AND LOOKS LIKE STICKY TAR.  TRIED TO CLEAN IT, BUT IT WILL NOT SCRUB OFF OR SCRAPE OFF CLEANLY.  FIRST TIME I SAW LITTLE BLACK SPOTS, I BROUGHT IT UP TO THE DEALERSHIP TO ASK IF THIS WOULD BE A PART OF MY WARRENTY COVERAGE.  I READ MY WARRENTY BOOK MANY TIMES AND I COULDN'T FIND THAT TYPE OF DEFECT ANY WHERE LISTED.  THE GUY TOLD ME THAT IT'S NOT COVERED UNDER WARRENTY, AND SINCE THE SPOTS WERE SO LITTLE, HE TOLD ME TO GO HOME AND CLEAN IT OFF AND THE SPOTS WON'T COME BACK.  NEXT SUMMER CAME AROUND AND IT GOT WORSE.  NOW IT LOOKS LIKE A BUNCH OF GLUMPED TAR ALL OVER THE BOTTOM PANEL OF THE DOORS.  I BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THE SERVICE TECH TOLD ME IF I HAD BROUGHT IT UNDER WARRENTY, THEY COULD HAVE REPAIRED IT AT NO CHARGE.  BUT BECAUSE I'M OVER MY WARRENTY LIMIT, I WOULD HAVE TO PAY A LITTLE OVER $200.00 PER DOOR FOR REPAIRS.  I ADVISED HIM THE PRIOR YEAR I HAD CAME AND ASKED, ONE OF THERE SERVICE TECHS TOLD ME IT WAS \"NOT\" UNDER WARRENTY THAT'S WHY THE PROBLEM WAS NEVER FIXED.  HE STATED THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO.  I AM EXTREMELY UPSET, THAT I WAS GIVEN FALSE INFO AT FIRST AND NOW I CAN'T EVEN GET MY DOORS FIXED UNLESS I PAY OUT OF MY POCKET FOR A DEFECT THAT IS NOT MINE.  I HOPE THAT THERE WILL BE A RESOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM BETTER THAN WHAT WAS OFFERED AT THE DEALERSHIP.",
