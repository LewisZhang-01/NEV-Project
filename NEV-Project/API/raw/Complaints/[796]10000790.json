NOW I HAVE DISCOVERED SEVERAL MORE R/T'S WITH THE SAME PROBLEM! CHRYSLER/DODGE WON'T OR CAN'T FIX! HOW MANY MORE ARE OUT THERE? REAR WHEELS WILL NOT STOP TURNING UNDER UNDER ANY CONDITION EXCEPT USING THE EMERGENCY BRAKE. FOUND THIS OUT ON SNOWY STREET WHILE STOPPING. WHEN VEHICLE FINALLY STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF INTERSECTION, THE SPEEDOMETER WAS READING 10 MPH! LOOKED OUT DOOR AT REAR WHEELS AND THEY WERE SPINNING WITH THE BRAKE PEDAL DEPRESSED HARD. IT'S NO WONDER THEY CAN'T KEEP FRONT ROTORS ON THESE VEHICLES, THEY ARE DOING 100% OF THE STOPPING!",
