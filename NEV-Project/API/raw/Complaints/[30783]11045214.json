THE STEERING WHEEL HAS REALIGNED SLIGHTLY OFF-CENTER SEVERAL TIMES BUT THE SYSTEM RESETS MOST OF THE TIME AFTER TURNING THE VEHICLE OFF AND RESTARTING IT SEVERAL MINUTES LATER. TWICE NOW THOUGH, THE STEERING WHEEL STAYED AT NINETY DEGREES WHILE DRIVING STRAIGHT. LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP COMPLETED A SOFTWARE/CODE RESET TWICE, SO UNKNOWN IF IT IS AN ELECTRONIC OR MECHANICAL ISSUE. THE DEALERSHIP IS REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE INFORMATION ADVISING STEERING WHEEL REPLACEMENT. THE INITIAL DIAGNOSIS WAS UNDER WARRANTY AT AROUND 26K MILES; SECOND RESET HAD TO BE DONE AT AROUND 46K. THE FAULT SEEMS TO ACTIVATE ONLY IF MOVING AT FIVE MPH OR LESS AND TURNING THE WHEEL IN EITHER DIRECTION.",
