I TOOK THE CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP AND SAID THAT MY COMPRESSOR HAD EXPLODED AND THAT I NEED TO REPLACE THE COMPRESSOR, CONDENSER, CLUTCH AND COIL (WHEN THE COMPRESSOR EXPLODES, IT SEND METAL SHARDS THROUGH THE SYSTEM)T FOR A COST OF $2100.  I HAVE LOOKED INTO THIS ISSUE ON THE INTERNET AND HAVE FOUND THAT THIS IS VERY COMMON FOR THIS VEHICLE TO CONTACT HONDA USA CUSTOMER SERVICE.  WHEN I CALLED THEM, THEY SAID THAT IT WAS UNFORTUNATE, BUT IT IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY AS MY MILEAGE IS APPROX 63K MILES, AND THAT I NEEDED TO SPEAK TO THE DEALERSHIP TO SEE WHAT THEY COULD DO.  CURRENTLY, THERE IS ONE SITE COLLECTING DATA TO FORM A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AND NUMEROUS SITES WITH COUNTLESS ACCOUNTS OF THE EXACT SAME ISSUE - THE COMPRESSOR EXPLODING USUALLY BETWEEN 40K-70K MILES ON MODEL YEARS 2002-2005, WITH MULTIPLE INDIVIDUALS HAVING TO HAVE THEIR UNITS MULTIPLE TIMES. *TR",
