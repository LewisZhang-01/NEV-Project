        "summary": "THE CAR HAS EXPERIENCED A MAJOR SAFETY PROBLEM THAT IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE ENGINE STOPPING WHILE DRIVING. ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE THE CAR WAS REPAIRED, THE PROBLEM IS DUE TO THE THROTTLE PLATE CLOSING FOR A SELF-CLEANING MODE DURING NORMAL DRIVING OPERATION, THIS CAUSES THE ENGINE TO SHUT-OFF FROM LACK OF AIR.   I BELIEVE THIS TO BE A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE THE CAR ENGINE STOPS WHEN DRIVING THE CAR. I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR (JAGUAR XJ8 VANDEN PLAS) INTO THE DEALER (BAUER JAGUAR- SANTA ANA, CA) TO FIX THE PROBLEM ON 3 DIFFERENT OCCASIONS. THE REPAIRS WERE MADE UNDER FACTORY WARRANTY ON ALL OCCASIONS. THE FIRST TIME I TOOK IT IN THE MILEAGE WAS 39,860 (FEB 28, 2002) - THE SECOND TIME MILEAGE WAS 44,898 (DEC 3, 2002) AND THE LAST TIME IT WAS 46,746 (MARCH 24, 2003). THE SERVICE WRITERS AT THE DEALERSHIP WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND HAVE SEEN IT ON SEVERAL OTHER VEHICLES. THE DEALERSHIP (BAUER JAGUAR) INSTITUTED A FIX (SEE BELOW) WHICH IS NOT FACTORY APPROVED THAT APPEARS TO HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM. MY CONCERN IS THIS COULD CAUSE ACCIDENTS AND POSSIBLE DEATHS TO OTHER OWNERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE &#34;FIX&#34; PERFORMED ON THEIR CARS.  THE PROBLEM AS THE SERVICE WRITER EXPLAINED TO ME, IS DUE TO THE THROTTLE BODY GOING INTO A  &#34;SELF CLEANING&#34; MODE WHILE THE CAR IS OPERATING. THIS &#34;SELF CLEANING&#34; MODE MEANS THE THROTTLE PLATE CLOSES WHICH SHUTS-OFF AIR TO THE ENGINE, CAUSING ENGINE SHUTDOWN. THE &#34;FIX&#34; IS TO INSTALL A STOP ON THE THROTTLE PLATE SO THAT THE PLATE CANNOT COMPLETELY CLOSE.",
