I TOOK IT TO FORD AND THEY SAID IT NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION. WE CHANGED ALL THE SPARKPLUGS (THEY NEEDED CHANGED) IT RAN GREAT FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS, THEN IT STARTED AGAIN. MORE FREQUENTLY, AND AT ALL SPEEDS. IT'S DANGEROUS, ESPECIALLY GOING AROUND CURVES OR ON THE FREEWAY. I LOVE MY ESCAPE, AND I DON'T TRUST THE FORD DEALERSHIP, THAT TRIED TO SELL ME A $2800 TRANSMISSION. FOR SOME REASON IT'S NOT GETTING SPARK. I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A REPAIR MANUAL, HOPING IT WILL HELP ME FIGURE OUT WHY THIS HAPPENS. I'M NO MECHANIC, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S SOMETHING FIXABLE.  *TR",
