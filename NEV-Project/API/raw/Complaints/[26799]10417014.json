THIS PAST WEEK WE HAD A SPARK PLUG BLOW OUT OF THE HEAD OF ONE OF OUR VEHICLES THIS IS THE THIRD TIME IT HAS OCCURRED ON THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE EACH TIME WE HAVE TO PLACE IT IN THE SHOP IT COSTS NEARLY $300.00 TO HAVE IT REPAIRED. NOT TO MENTION THE LOSS OF USE OF THE TRUCK FOR 2 -3 DAYS.  WHILE RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM ONLINE I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THIS HAS BEEN A FAIRLY COMMON OCCURRENCE ON MANY OF THESE ENGINES FOR SEVERAL YEARS.   I WONDER IF THEIR IS SOME RECOURSE THRU FORD OTHER THAN A CLASS ACTION LAW SUITE TO RECOVER THE EXPENSE? PLEASE RESPOND YOURS TRULY[XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
