        "summary": "ON 8/11/2015 I CONTACTED NISSAN REGIONAL TO FILE A COMPLAINT, 19756783, ABOUT A POSSIBLE ISSUE WITH MY TRUCK.  I WAS TOLD TO TAKE THE TRUCK IN TO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP TO HAVE A DIAGNOSTIC.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP BUT WAS TOLD I HAD TO PAY A $139.99 DIAGNOSTIC FEE. I DIDN'T HAVE THOSE FUNDS AT THE TIME.  MY TRUCK IS NOW STARTING TO SHOW SIGNS OF JERKING WHILE DRIVING.  A MONTH AGO , I WAS TOLD THE TRANSMISSION AND RADIATOR FLUIDS MAY BE MIXING TOGETHER.  AUTO MECHANIC SAID THE FLUIDS LOOKED MILKY.  I DRIVE MY FOUR CHILDREN , AGES 11 MONTHS TO 8 YEARS OF AGE ON A DAILY BASIS TO AND FROM SCHOOL AND AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES.  WE HAVE FAMILY IN THE KENOSHA, WISCONSIN AREA WHICH WE OFTEN FREQUENT.  I AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED THAT THE TRANSMISSION WILL FAIL WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT A HIGH SPEED.  WHENEVER I HAVE TO GO FAR, I DRIVE OUR  SEDAN WHICH SEATS 5 PASSENGERS, YET THERE ARE 6 PEOPLE IN OUR FAMILY.  I AM AWARE THIS IS NOT SAFE, HOWEVER I FEEL THAT IT IS SAFER THAN DRIVING MY TRUCK WHICH CAN STALL AT ANY TIME NOW.  AT THIS TIME, OUR CHILDREN ARE OUR FIRST PRIORITY AND WE WANT TO PREVENT ANY MISHAPS TO HAPPEN.  WE DON'T WANT TO BE STRANDED WITH OUR FOUR CHILDREN.        I HAVE MY TRUCK MAINTENANCED QUITE OFTEN BECAUSE I TAKE PRIDE IN DRIVING A NISSAN.  I DON'T WANT TO MY EXPERIENCE FROM NISSAN TO GO FROM POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE.  NISSAN, PLEASE LISTEN TO MY CONCERN AS WELL AS OTHERS.  I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THE $3,000 DEDUCTIBLE YOU ARE ASKING FOR TO HAVE THE TRANSMISSION AND RADIATOR REPLACED. WE ARE ON A FIXED INCOME AS MY HUSBAND IS THE ONLY BREAD-WINNER IN OUR HOME.   PLEASE HELP.....",
