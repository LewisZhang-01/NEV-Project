LUCKILY BOTH FAILURES OCCURED IN TOWN AT LOW VELOCITY AS THE CAR SLOWS RAPIDLY AND IS UNDRIVABLE AFTER THE FAILURE.  HAD THE FAILURES OCCURED IN HIGH SPEED HIGHWAY TRAFIC OR IN A REMOTE AREA IN COLD WEATHER THE RESULTS COULD HAVE BEEN DESASTEROUS.  VW REFUSES TO REPLACE THE REMAINING COILS UNLESS THEY FAIL, AND THEY READILY ADMIT THAT THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT THEY WILL FAIL.  VW SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO IMMEDIATELY RECALL AND REPLACE TE DEFECTIVE COILS AS THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOMEONE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED.",
