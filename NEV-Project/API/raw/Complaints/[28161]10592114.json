WE RESTARTED THE CAR AND GAVE IT THE GAS AND IT QUIT AGAIN STILL NO ENGINE LIGHTS CAME ON.WE WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND RESTARTED THE CAR AND GOT OFF THE INTERSTATE AND DROVE ON A SIDE ROAD TO SEE IF THE COMPUTER WOULD RESET ITSELF.WE HAD NO PROBLEM AFTER THAT.WE THEN TOOK IT INTO THE DEALER AND THEY WENT THROUGH THE VEHICLE AND COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG.I ASKED THE DEALER IF THIS COULD HAPPEN WHEN WE WERE GOING 65MPH AND HAVE THE ENGINE QUIT AND HE SAID YES.IF WERE ON THE INTERSTATE AND GOING 65-70MPH AND THE ENGINE QUITS WE COULD BE KILLED BY A TRUCK HITTING US.THIS IS OUR 3RD SANTA FE BUT WERE ARE TERRIFIED OF DRIVING THIS VEHICLE ESPECIALLY WITH THE GRAND KIDS.I DID CALL HYUNDAI CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS TREATED LIKE I WAS AN IDIOT HE WAS ONE OF THE WORST PERSON I HAVE EVER TALKED TO IN CUSTOMER SERVICE.THE REASON I'M SENDING THIS TO YOU SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS.    *JS",
