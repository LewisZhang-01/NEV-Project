THE CONTACT TRIED MOVING THE STEERING WHEEL TO UNLOCK THE IGNITION AND WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER TAPPED ON THE IGNITION AND UNLOCKED THE STEERING WHEEL. THE CONTACT DROVE THE VEHICLE TO A LOCAL MECHANIC WHO LUBRICATED THE IGNITION SWITCH; YET, THE IGNITION LOCKED AGAIN. THE MECHANIC COULD NOT ORDER THE PART FOR THE IGNITION AND THE CONTACT TOOK THE VEHICLE TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALER. THE DEALER INFORMED THE CONTACT THAT THE IGNITION LOCK CYLINDER NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE CONTACT CALLED THE MANUFACTURER REGARDING A GOOD FAITH REPAIR. THE MANUFACTURER STATED THAT SINCE THE VEHICLE WARRANTY WAS NOT VALID THAT THEY WOULD NOT REPAIR THE VEHICLE AT NO CHARGE. THE CONTACT IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY RISK AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING STRANDED IF THE FAILURE RECURS. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 135,000.",
