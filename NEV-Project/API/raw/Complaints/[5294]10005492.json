        "summary": "I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE, 1997 PONTIAC GRAND PRIX ON 5/5/01 WITH 50,768 MILES.  I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALER FOR A RECALL ON THE FRONT STEERING PINION.  I HAD ASKED THEM TO REPLACE THE COOLANT SINCE THE MANUAL CALLED TO REPLACE AT 5 YEARS OR 150,000 MILES.  I WAS INFORMED THAT THE INTAKE MANIFOLD WAS LEAKING AND WAS TURNING MY ANTIFREEZE INTO MUD.  I ASKED THE SERVICE MANAGER WHAT CAUSED THE MANIFOLD TO LEAK.  HE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS WARPED AND WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED.  THE COST TO REPLACE IT WOULD BE $400.00.  MY CAR HAS APPROXIMATELY 13,000 MILES ON IT SINCE I BOUGHT IT.  IT IS MAINLY USED LOCALLY WITH THE LONGEST ROUND TRIP DRIVEN TO DATE AT APPROXIMATELY 100 MILES.  I HAVE MY OIL CHANGED AT REGULAR INTERVALS WITH THE DEALER, AND MAINTAIN ALL OTHER FLUIDS, WIPERS ETC.  I ASKED THE MANAGER HOW LONG IT WOULD TATLE TO REPLACE IT.  HE SAID THAT THEY HAVE REPLACED 12 OF THESE JUST IN JANUARY OF 2003.  I ASKED HIM HOW MANY HE REPLACED LAST YEAR, AND HE SAID MORE THAN HE COULD COUNT.  HE SAID IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE LONGER TO FIND ONE, GET IT ORDERED, THAN IT WILL TO REPLACE IT.  HE SAID THIS PART IS A COMMON FAILURE ON THE 3.8 LITER ENGINE.  IF YOU DON'T REPLACE IT, WATER BUILDS UP IN THE MANIFOLD, AND RUNS DOWN INTO THE ENGINE.  THIS WILL TAKE THE BEARINGS OUT OF THE MOTOR.  WHY WOULD THE MANUFACTURER CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS PIECE KNOWING THAT IT COULD CAUSE A MAJOR ENGINE FAILURE.  I CAN ONLY GUESS TO REPLACE THE ENGINE IN MY CAR WOULD BE AT LEAST $5000.00 OR MORE.  WHY HASN'T THIS PART BEEN RECALLED OR CORRECTED?  IS THERE A POTENTIAL FOR ME TO HAVE AN ENGINE COMPARTMENT FIRE?  PLEASE EMAIL ME WITH CONFIRMATION THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED MY COMPLAINT.  WHERE DO I GO FROM HERE?",
