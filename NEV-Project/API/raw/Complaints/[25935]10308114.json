USUALLY THE LIGHTS GO OFF BY THEMSELVES AFTER A FEW MILES OF DRIVING OR IF THE CAR IS TURNED OFF. THE LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED, I DROVE STRAIGHT TO THE MECHANIC. THE MECHANIC SAID THAT THE FAULT CODES INDICATED THAT THE PRESSURE WAS HIGH IN THE ABS. I WAS ADVISED THAT THE CODES COULD BE RESET BUT THE BRAKES WERE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. IN FACT, THEY  WERE NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY BECAUSE THEY SLIPPED INSTEAD OF STOPPED WHEN I APPLIED BRAKE PRESSURE WHEN THE STREET WAS WET. THE BRAKES HAVE SLIPPED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS WHEN STOPPING ON WET SURFACES THOUGH THEY DO STOP THE CAR. *TR",
