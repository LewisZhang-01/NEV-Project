I HAD THE CAR PARKED AND NO ONE DROVE THE VEHICLE AND IT ONLY HAS APPROXIMATELY 7,500 MILES ON THE ODOMETER. I WENT TO APPLY THE BRAKES FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THE VEHICLE SURGED BACK AND FORTH AND ALMOST CRASHED. THE BRAKES CATCH\" AND THEN RELEASE IN A SEVERE LUNGING MOTION AND THE CAR IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE. AFTER SPEAKING TO THE DEALER, I WAS TOLD THAT  THERE IS RUST BUILDUP AND IT WOULD NOT BE UNDER WARRANTY AND I MUST PAY FOR THE REPAIRS.  IN ALL MY 30 YEARS OF DRIVING I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING AND CONSIDER THE BRAKING SYSTEM OR PARTS INFERIOR AND THEIR SHOULD BE A WARNING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM OR IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY A FATAL SITUATION. I HAVE HAD VEHICLES SIT AROUND FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH A PROBLEM SUCH AS THIS. SO IT SEEMS THAT AFTER GOING AWAY AND RETURNING TO DRIVE THIS  $23K VEHICLE, I MUST PAY FOR REPAIRS EVERY TIME. I WILL NOT DRIVE THIS VEHICLE AND AM LOOKING INTO LEGAL ACTION.  *JB",
