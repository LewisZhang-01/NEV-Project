WE LIFTED UP THE SPARE TIRE PIECE IN THE TRUNK BECAUSE IT SMELLED REALLY BAD IN THE TRUNK AND FOUND THE PIECE WAS WET AND HAD VISIBLE WATER DAMAGE.  THERE WAS A GOOD AMOUNT OF MOLD GROWING ON THE PIECE.  WE TOOK IT TO THE DEALER WHO FOUND A WATER LEAK FROM BEHIND THE TAIL LIGHTS.  THE MOLD WAS CLEANED OFF.  NOW THE DEALER WILL NOT PUT IT IN WRITING THAT THERE WAS ANY MOLD IN THE TRUNK.  I HAVE CONTACTED MANAGERS AT THE DEALERSHIP AND I HAVE CONTACTED FORD AT THE CUSTOMER CARE NUMBER.  I CAN NOT GET WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION THERE WAS MOLD IN MY VEHICLE.        *JB",
