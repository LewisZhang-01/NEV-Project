I'VE OBTAINED SEVERAL ESTIMATES RANGING FROM $700-$950 TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM.  DAIMLER CHRYSLER WILL NOT ISSUE ANY TYPE OF RECALL FOR THIS CAR OR MANY OTHER MODELS LIKE THE BREEZE, NEON, AVENGER AND CIRRUS.  THEY ARE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND HAVE BEEN FOR SOME TIME YET THEY REFUSE TO COVER THE PROBLEM UNDER WARRANTY NOR HAVE THEY ATTEMPTED TO REDESIGN THESE ENGINES SO THE HEAD GASKETS DON'T LEAK.  WHEN YOU PUT AN ALUMINUM HEAD ON A CAST-IRON BLOCK, THERE WILL BE LEAKS.  THE TWO DIFFERENT METALS HAVE TOO MANY DIFFERENCES IN HOW THEY REACT TO TEMPERATURE CHANGES.  AS LONG AS THESE METALS ARE PAIRED TOGETHER (AND THE UNSUSPECTING PUBLIC KEEPS BUYING THIS ILL-THOUGHT-OUT DESIGN) THERE WILL BE LEAKS.  *JB",
