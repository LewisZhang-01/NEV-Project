        "summary": "I HAVE A 2002 FORD EXPLORER AND HAVE HAD NUMEROUS PROBLEMS THAT THE DEALER HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIX.  AT ANY SPEED THE ENGINE IS CONSTANTLY MAKING A TICKING NOISE. SOMETIMES WHEN MAKING A COMPLETE STOP THE TRUCK WILL STALL AND THEN JERK FORWARD WHEN I AM TRYING TO PUSH ON THE GAS TO GO.  THIS HAPPENS SO MUCH AND I HAVE SENT IT IN NUMEROUS TIMES FOR THIS AND NO SOLUTION.  THIS ALSO HAPPENED TWICE ON THE FREEWAY WHEN I HAD TO PRESS ON THE BRAKES TO STOP QUICKLY THE TRUCK LOCKED UP FOR ABOUT 5-10 SECONDS AND THEN JERKED FORWARD.  I STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS SITUATION SINCE I AM IN A LEASE AND THE DEALERSHIP SAYS THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG.  I TELL THEM IT IS DANGEROUS FOR ME TO BE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE.  TWICE AT A STOP SIGN I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE TO GO BUT THE TRUCK STARTING MOVING BACKWARDS.  I PRESSED THE BRAKE AGAIN THEN RELEASED AND IT STILL MOVED BACKWARDS.  I THEN PUT IT IN PARK AND THEN BACK IN DRIVE AND THEN IT MOVE FORWARDED.  I TOOK THE TRUCK IN AGAIN THE NEXT DAY AND TOLD HIM THE SITUATION AND STILL NOTHING WAS DONE.",
