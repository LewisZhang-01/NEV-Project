        "summary": "WHEN I WOULD PLACE THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION IN REVERSE ON MY 1997 CHRYSLER CONCORDE THE GAS PEDAL WOULD STICK AND ACCELERATE AT A RAPID RATE. THE ONLY WAY THAT I COULD STOP THE ACCELERATION WAS BY PLACING BOTH ON THE BRAKE AND TURNING THE KEY OFF. DAVE DENNIS CHRYSLER DEALER IN DAYTON, OH., VERIFIED THIS. THEY FOUND THAT THE CRADLE BUSHINGS WERE BAD WHICH CAUSED THE MOTOR TO MOVE AND HIT THE THROTTLE WHICH CAUSED THE MOTOR TO REV. UP IN GEAR. THEY REPLACED THE CRADLE BUSHINGS AND I HAVE HAD NO TROUBLE SINCE. I CONSIDER THIS TO BE A SAFETY ISSUE. THE MECHANIC AT THE CHRYSLER DEALER STATED THAT WORN CRADLE BUSHINGS WERE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH K FRAMES USED ON CHRYSLERS. I CAN'T BE THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM DUE TO CRADLE BUSHINGS WEAR.   *NM",
