        "summary": "CLUTCH RELEASE BEARING (THROW OUT BEARING) ACTUATOR ARM FAILURE    RESULTING IN MOVEMENT OF VEHICLE WHILE CLUTCH PEDAL IS DEPRESSED     THIS IS THE SECOND FAILURE OF THE SUBJECT PART IN THE LIFE OF THIS SERIAL NUMBER TRUCK. THE FIRST OCCURRED AT APX. 37,000 MILES; THE SECOND AT APX. 95,000 MILES. BOTH REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED USING OEM PARTS. I AM IN POSSESSION OF THE SECOND FAILED PART AND WILL MAKE IT AVAILABLE FOR INSPECTION UPON REQUEST.    THIS FAILURE IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AS THE POWER TRAIN CAN NOT BE INTERRUPTED BY NORMAL MEANS. THAT IS, ONE NORMALLY DEPRESSES THE CLUTCH PEDAL TO INTERRUPT POWER TRANSMISSION AND APPLIES BRAKE ACTION TO STOP THE VEHICLE. WHEN THE SUBJECT ARM FAILS, ONE DEPRESSES THE CLUTCH PEDAL AND THE VEHICLE CONTINUES MOVEMENT, CAUSING AN INHERENT REACTION DELAY TO ASSES THE ABNORMALITY, SUBSEQUENTLY FOLLOWED BY APPLICATION OF BRAKE PRESSURE TO STOP THE VEHICLE, CAUSING A SIGNIFICANT BIND IN THE TRANSMISSION, RESULTING IN THE INABILITY TO MOVE THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTER OUT OF GEAR, THEN ONE MUST EITHER TURN OFF THE IGNITION OR APPLY BRAKE PRESSURE OF SUFFICIENT FORCE TO STALL THE ENGINE; ALL OF WHICH HAS CONSUMED AND EXCEEDED A REASONABLY PLANNED STOPPING DISTANCE.     THE RESULTING DELAY MAY RESULT IN INJURY OR DEATH OF BY STANDERS, SHOULD THEY BE PINCHED BETWEEN THE FAILURE VEHICLE AND A STATIONARY OBJECT.    THE OPERATING NATURE OF A TRUCK OF THIS DESIGN INCREASES THE RISK OF INJURY OR DEATH, FOLLOWING THE DESCRIBED FAILURE. THE MANUFACTURER MARKETS THIS TRUCK TO COMMERCIAL OPERATORS AND ONE WILL ROUTINELY FIND THE VEHICLE EMPLOYED ON WORK SITES AND SIMILARLY CONGESTED AREAS.    THIS FAILURE LEAVES THE TRUSTING AND CAPABLE OPERATORS OF THIS VEHICLE AND UNSUSPECTING BY-STANDERS AT RISK OF INJURY OR DEATH; WHILE AT PLAY OR ON THE WORK PLACE.",
