IT WAS SO UNEXPECTED THAT IT MADE MY 10 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND MYSELF JUMP.  I MANAGED TO SLOW DOWN IN TRAFFIC AND PULL TO THE RIGHT HAND EMERGENCY LANE.  WHEN I TRIED PULLING BACK INTO TRAFFIC TO MAKE IT TO THE NEXT EXIT, THE LINCOLN WOULD NOT MOVE.  LUCKILY, I HAD MY WORK CELLULAR TELEPHONE AND CALLED 911.  911 TRANSFERRED THE CALL TO THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT, AND SOMEONE CAME TO TRY TO HELP.  I HAVE ONLY HAD THE VEHICLE FOR 3 MONTHS.  THE ORIGINAL OWNERS WERE IN THEIR 70'S.  PRIOR TO SELLING THE LINCOLN A MOTOR HAD BEEN INSTALLED.  *AK",
