        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 2002 TOYOTA TACOMA DOUBLE CAB NEW AFTER A FEW THOUSAND MILES NOTICED THAT UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR MAT WAS WET. TOYOTA HAS MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM AND IS STILL UNSUCCESSFUL, BUT THEY STATE THE PROBLEM IS REPAIRED BECAUSE THERE LEAK TEST DOES NOT SHOW THE LEAK,  HOWEVER WHEN IT RAINS IT GETS WET. I FILED FOR ARBITRATION AND RECENTLY LOST, BECAUSE THEY STATED 5 REPAIR ATTEMPTS WAS NOT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER EVEN THOUGH THE LAW SAYS 3 IS ENOUGH. I URGE ALL TOYOTA TRUCK OWNERS TO CHECK UNDER YOU FLOOR MATS AND LOOK TO SEE IF YOU HAVE THIS PROBLEM IF SO FILE A COMPLAINT AND LET THEM KNOW SO THEY DO NOT CONTINUE WITH THIS FAULTY PRODUCT AS THEY ARE NOW DOING. THE INCIDENT DATE LISTED BELOW STATES TODAY'S DATE BUT I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THIS PROBLEM FOR OVER A YEAR NOW WITH LITTLE TO NO HELP FROM TOYOTA.    *JB",
