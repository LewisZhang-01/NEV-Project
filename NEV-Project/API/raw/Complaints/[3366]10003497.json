        "summary": "I WAS MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC WHEN WHAT I NOW KNOW AS ONE OF MY IGNITION COILS FAILED.  THE CAR INITIALLY LOST SIGNIFICANT POWER AND THEN FROM THERE CONTINUALLY DROVE AS THOUGH IT WAS MISFIRING.  FORTUNATELY, THE CAR I WAS TURNING IN FRONT OF HAD TIME TO SLOW DOWN.  I NOW WONDER IF VW IS JUST WAITING AROUND UNTIL SOMEONE ACTUALLY GETS HURT FROM SOMETHING THEY CALL \"NOT A SAFETY ISSUE.\"  THEY PROBABLY HOPE THAT THE PEOPLE THIS HAPPENS TO DON'T COMPLAIN AT ALL AND THAT THIS WILL DIE DOWN UNNOTICED AS TO NOT HURT THEIR PRECIOUS REPUTATION.  I DROVE IT SLOWLY TO THE VW DEALERSHIP THE NEXT DAY.  THEY ONLY REPLACED ONE OF THE COILS.  INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, EVEN THOUGH MY CAR HAS LONG BEEN OUT OF WARRANTY AS A RESULT OF MILES, VW PAID FOR THE PART AND THE LABOR.  IF THAT ISN'T A SIGN THE PART SHOULD BE RECALLED, THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.  UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE 3 MORE TIMES THAT THIS COULD POTENTIALLY HAPPEN.  I WOULD LIKE IMMEDIATE RESULTS IN HAVING THE OTHER 3 REPLACED.  I WAS TOLD THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN.  WHAT COMPANY ADMITS THEY KNOWINGLY HAVE PARTS THAT ARE EXPIRING EARLIER THAN THEY SHOULD  (IN MOST CASES AFFECTING 1/2 POWER LOSS IN A CAR) AND THEN ONLY REPLACES THE ONES THAT GOES BAD?????",
