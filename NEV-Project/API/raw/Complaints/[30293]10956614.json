ON FEBRUARY 19, 2017 WHILE DRIVING ON A RESIDENTIAL STREET AT LESS THAN 25MPH THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE TIRE SUFFERED A \"CATASTROPHIC\" SIDEWALL FAILURE RESULTING IN THE TIRE GOING COMPLETELY FLAT IN LESS THAT 1 MINUTE. THE FAILURE OCCURRED ON THE INSIDE SIDEWALL OF THE TIRE. (THIS SEEMS TO BE THE SAME SYMPTOM FOR WHICH HANKOOK ISSUED AN EARLIER - JAN 2016 - RECALL.) ALL FOUR TIRES WERE PROPERLY INFLATED AS INDICATED BY THE TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE THE TIRE HAD NEVER STRUCK AN OBJECT THAT COULD HAVE WEAKENED THE SIDEWALL.",
