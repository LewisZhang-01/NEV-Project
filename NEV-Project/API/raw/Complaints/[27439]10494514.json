        "summary": "MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE WAS A 2001 SUBARU OUTBACK AND THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THE REAR SUBFRAME RUSTING. THE RUST PROBLEM ON MY MAXIMA CONCERNS A COMPONENT AT LEAST AS IMPORTANT AS THE SUBFRAME ON THE SUBARU. THE VEHICLE HAS A METAL RADIATOR SUPPORT AT THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE THAT RUNS THE WIDTH OF THE CAR. THIS RADIATOR SUPPORT NOT ONLY HOLDS THE RADIATOR UP, BUT IS ALSO CONNECTED TO AN ENGINE SUPPORT IN THE CENTRE. THIS RADIATOR SUPPORT IS RUSTING THROUGH RIGHT IN THE CENTRE WHERE THE ENGINE SUPPORT BOLTS TO THE RAD SUPPORT. THIS PROBLEM IS WIDESPREAD ON THE 2000-2003 AND THE 1995 - 1999 MAXIMA. A GOOGLE SEARCH WILL REVEAL THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM. IMAGINE THE CONSEQUENCES IF THE RAD SUPPORT SHOULD FAIL AND THUS, THE ENGINE BECOME UNSUPPORTED WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION? WHETHER THIS IS POOR METAL QUALITY, OR A LACK OF PROPER RUSTPROOFING PAINT (AS IT WAS WITH THE OUTBACK) I DON'T KNOW. THERE ARE VEHICLES OUT THERE WITH MINOR RUST IN OTHER MAJOR COMPONENTS, BUT A COMPLETELY ROTTED RADIATOR SUPPORT.  I BELIEVE SOME INVESTIGATION BY THE NHTSA IS WARRANTED.  I'M IN CANADA, BUT THIS PROBLEM IS RAMPANT IN THE US AS WELL.  *TR",
