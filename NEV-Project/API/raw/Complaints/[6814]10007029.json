NOW I SEE IN THE HEADLINES OF THE PAPER A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST FORD FOR VEHICLES DOING THE EXACT SAME THING WE ARE EXPERIENCING.  WHEN I CALLED FORD CONSUMER LINE THEY SAID THERE WAS NO RECALL AT THIS TIME AND NOT TO BOTHER CALLING THEM!  THIS VEHICLE IS DANGEROUS AS IT STOPS RUNNING WITHOUT WARNING LEAVING NO POWER STEERING, NO BRAKES AND LOSS OF CONTROL AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  WE NEED HELP WITH THIS PROBLEM AS WE ARE UNABLE TO USE THE VEHICLE AS IS AND WE REFUSE TO PASS THIS PROBLEM ON TO ANOTHER PERSON AS FORD HAS ALREADY DONE TO US AND OTHERS BY SELLING THEIR DEFECTIVE VEHICLES AND NOT OFFERING SOLUTIONS TOT HE PROBLEMS THEIR HAPHAZARD WORKMANSHIP HAS CREATED.   *NLM         **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*734336",
