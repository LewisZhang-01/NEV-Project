WHEN I FIRST REPORTED TO CARMAX, ONE OF THE TECHNICIANS DROVE WITH ME AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS A DEFECT ALSO.  CARMAX REPLACED THE GAS TANK, AND YOU CAN STILL HEAR THE GAS.  I WAS TOLD THAT THEY TEST DROVE BOTH THE V6 AND V4 ENGINE CARS AND THEY BOTH DID THE SAME THING.  YOUR PROMPT RESPONSE WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.
