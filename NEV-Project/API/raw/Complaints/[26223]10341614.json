        "summary": "THE HEADLAMP IN THE 2006 TOYOTA PRIUS WORKED INTERMITTENTLY. I AM UNSURE OF THE DURATION OF THIS BUT SUSPECT IT LASTED FOR APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS BEFORE TAKING IT TO A DEALER. THE HEADLAMP APPEARED TO DIM WHILE DRIVING BUT STOPPING AND CHECKING REVEALED THAT THE HEADLAMP WAS WORKING PROPERLY. WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS TURNED OFF AND IMMEDIATELY BACK ON, THE HEADLAMP WORKED. IT WENT OUT WHILE DRIVING AND, JUST AS SUDDENLY, CAME BACK ON. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THE HID NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH LABOR COST TO REMOVE THE BUMPER (APPROXIMATELY $300) FOR HEADLAMP REPLACEMENT, BOTH LAMPS WERE REPLACED AT A COST OF ABOUT $700. I DID NOT ASK FOR THE REPLACED PART AND THE DEALER DID NOT OFFER IT.  (THE TRIP TO THE DEALER WAS DELAYED UNTIL ALL OTHER POSSIBILITIES HAD BEEN EXPLORED BECAUSE THE COST INVOLVED.) THE UNSAFE CONDITION OF DRIVING WITH ONE FUNCTIONAL HEADLAMP AND ONE INTERMITTENTLY FUNCTION HEADLAMP WAS NECESSARY UNTIL THE MONEY FOR REPAIRS COULD BE OBTAINED. *TR",
