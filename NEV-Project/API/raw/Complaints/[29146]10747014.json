WE HAVE HAD CONSIDERABLE PROBLEMS WITH IT, BUT NEVER EXPECTED TO FIND THAT THE BRAKES, GREASE SEALS, AND WHEEL BEARINGS WERE IN INSTALLED CORRECTLY. I BECAME AWARE THAT THERE WERE MANY REPORTS OF PROBLEMS WITH THE GREASE SEALS AND WHEEL BEARINGS. I WAS IN TEXAS AND WE HAD THE GREASE SEALS AND WHEEL BEARINGS SERVICED. I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THAT ALL OF THE GREASE SEALS WERE LEAKING AND THE BEARINGS WERE NOT ADJUSTED CORRECTLY. I HAD ALL OF THE GREASE SEALS REPLACED AND THE BEARINGS PACKED CORRECTLY AND INSTALLED CORRECTLY. I AM AMAZED THAT WE HAD NOT HAD A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE IN THE 15,000 MILES THAT WE HAD TRAVELLED. THIS IS A POTENTIALLY VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION.",
