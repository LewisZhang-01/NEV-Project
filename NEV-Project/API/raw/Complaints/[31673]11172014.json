I LOOKED TO SEE IF A CAR HAD HIT ME AND THEIR WAS NO CAR THERE. I PULLED OVER TO INSPECT THE DAMAGE AND LOOKED FOR A ROCK OR STONE. NOTHING WAS THERE, THE REAR WINDOW JUST BROKE ON IT'S OWN. I WAS USING MY REAR DEFROSTER AT THE TIME. IT WAS STRANGE AND I BELIEVE THIS TO BE A FAULT FROM THE FACTORY. I HAVE READ THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE IN THE PAST WITH SUBARU. THE REAR GLASS HAD NO CHIPS OR CRACKS PRIOR TO THIS SPONTANEOUS DAMAGE.",
