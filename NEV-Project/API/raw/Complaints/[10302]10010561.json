        "summary": "VEHICLE STALLS OUT WHILE IN MOTION AT ANY GIVEN TIME.  CAME VERY CLOSE TO BEING REAR ENDED BY A TRACTOR TRAILER.  IT IS ALWAYS A GUARANTEE THAT AFTER PUTTING GAS IN THE VEHICLE IT WILL STALL OUT APPORX. 2-3 MILES AFTERWARDS, SOMETIMES FOR OVER 45 MINS. AT A TIME.  VEHICLE HAD (2) DIAGNOSTIC REPORTS DONE IN WHICH THE FIRST STATED THE INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKETS NEEDED REPLACING AND THE THROTTLE BODY NEEDED CLEANING.  THIS WAS NOT TRUE, SINCE BOTH WERE COMPLETED, VEHICLE CONTINUES TO STALL OUT WHILE DRIVING IN GENERAL TRAFFIC OR STOPPED AT A TRAFFIC SIGNAL.  THE SECOND DIAGNOSTIC DONE STATED NOTHING WAS WRONG, HOWEVER, AFTER DESCRIBING TO THE DEALER THE MULTIPLE PROBLEMS, THEY SUGGESTED THAT THE PCM NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.  AFTER REVIEWING THE COMPLAINTS ON THIS SIGHT THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT I HAVE , IT APPEARS THAT THIS COULD BE EITHER THE (PCM) OR (CENTRAL COMPUTER MODULE/PICK UP PLATE) THAT IS THE PROBLEM.   *NLM    DEALER CURRENTLY WORKING ON REPLACING THE PCM, BUT I WILL ALSO QUESTION THE (CENTRAL COMPUTER MODULE/PICK UP PLATE) TO SEE IF THE TWO ARE IN RELATION TO ONE ANOTHER.    I PRAY THAT THIS WILL RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM AS I FEAR THAT I AM DRIVING AROUND IN A DEATH TRAP BECAUSE OF THE MULTIPLE CLOSE CALLS THAT I HAVE HAD IN THIS VEHICLE WHILE STALLING OUT IN THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACES.  *NLM",
