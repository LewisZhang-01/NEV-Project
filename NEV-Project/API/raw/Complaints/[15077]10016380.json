        "summary": "BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT BRAKE LIGHTS FAILED TO OPERATE.  VEHICLE WAS BOUGHT NEW 7.5 MONTHS AGO AND HAS ABOUT 8000 MILES.   FOUND THE FUSES GOOD AND THE LIGHT BULB FILAMENTS GOOD.  WHILE CHECKING THE LIGHT BULBS,  I DISCOVERED THAT MOVING THEM SLIGHTLY IN THE OUT DIRECTION, THE LIGHTS WOULD COME ON.  UPON EXAMINATION, IT APPEARS  THE METAL CONNECTION TABS WITHIN LIGHT SOCKET AND/OR THE BULB WIRE- TYPE CONNECTIONS MAY HAVE BEEN DAMAGED BY HEAT. THERE IS SOME DISCOLORATION ON BOTH.  ALTHOUGH THE BULBS ARE NOT BURNED OUT, THEY WILL NOT WORK WHEN FULLY SEATED INTO THE SOCKET - THERE IS NO ELECTRICAL CONNECTION.  THEY DO WORK WHEN PULLED SLIGHTLY OUT.  I  INSTALLED NEW BULBS WHICH DO WORK WHEN FULLY SEATED.   I  NOW WONDER HOW LONG IT WILL BE BEFORE THIS PROBLEM OCCURS AGAIN.     I BELIEVE THERE MAY A DESIGN DEFECT WITH EITHER THE SOCKET OR THE BULB, WHERE HEAT BUILDUP IN THE CONNECTION WAS NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.  *JB",
