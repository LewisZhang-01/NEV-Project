CAR IS 3 YEARS OLD AND THE MECHANIC CLAIMED HE NEVER HAD TO REPLACE BOTH REAR HUB ASSEMBLYS ON SUCH A NEW VEHICLE. THE ASSEMBLY LEFT NO ROOM TO LUBRICATE THE BEARINGS WHICH CAUSED THEM TO KEEP IN MOISTURE AND RUST PREMATURELY. MECHANIC SAID THE PARTS WERE FILLED WITH RUST FRAGMENTS TO THE POINT HE WAS SURPRISED THE TIRES STAYED ATTACHED TO THE AXLE. MITSUBISHI PARTS SUPPLIER SAID THIS WASN'T A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THAT MODEL YEAR BUT SAID THERE WAS A LOT OF REPLACEMENT PARTS BEING SOLD.",
