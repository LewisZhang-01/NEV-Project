IN NEARLY 30 YEARS OF DRIVING VARIOUS VEHICLES, BUT IN THE SAME GENERAL VICINITY, I MUST SAY THESE ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORSE TIRES EVER!!!!  MY HUSBAND AND 3 TOW TRUCK DRIVERS CONCUR.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS. I'VE HAD 3 COMPLETELY SHREDDED TIRES  IN 15 MONTHS.  I'VE BEEN VERY METICULOUS ABOUT TIRE PRESSURES AS WELL, SO THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM.  I THINK THESE ARE JUST VERY CHEAP AND HAZARDOUS TIRES.  WARNING!!!  *TR",
