        "summary": "PLYMOUTH VOYGER MINIVAN  I JUST PURCHSED A 1999 VOYGER AND THE FIRST DAY THAT I HAD IT I WAS SHOCKED THAT IT DID NOT HAVE A BREAK SHIFT INTERLOCK SYSTEM INSTALLED. HOW I FOUND THIS OUT WAS IT WENT INTO GEAR AND I ALMOST RAN INTO THE CAN IN FRONT OF ME IN A PARKING LOT JUST BARLY MISSING MY 6 YEAR OLD AND 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. IT WAS COLD OUTSIDE AND I GOT INTO THE CAR TO WARM IT UP AND I LEANED OVER TO GET SOMETHING OFF OF THE DASH AND BUMPED THE GEAR SHIFT IT DEPLOYED AND THE CAR PRECEIDED TO MOVE. THIS IS THE FIRST CHRYSLER CAR THAT I HAVE EVER HAD AND I AM KINDA DISAPOINTED IN THIS FEATURE. SINCE THIS NEAR ACCIDENT I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT IT WAS ON AN OPTION NOR A STANDARD. IT MAKES ME WONDER WHAT ELSE IS MISSING. I PURCJHSED THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE CHRYSLER CONTENDS THAT IT LINE OF VANS AND MINIVANS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THE LEADER IN SAFTEY. HUMMS MAKES YOU THINK. I NEVER LEAVE MY CHILDREN IN A CAR ALONE NOT FOR ONE MIN.I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR NEARLY 37 YEARS AND HAVE ALWYS RELIED ON THE CAR MANUFACTURES TO BE ON TOP OF THIS ISSUE AND OTHER THAT ARE IN THE INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC. MY RESEARCH HAD FOUND THAT THIS TYPE OF SAFTEY ISSUE IS REALLY A HOT DEBATE, SOMETHING I FEEL THAT NEEDS FURTHRE INVESTAGATION  WELL I HOPE I HAVE OPENED SOME EYES. THANK YOU FOR YOU TIME AND HAVE A GREAT HOLIDAY SEASON.",
