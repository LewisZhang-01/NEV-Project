WHEN NOTIFIED OF THE RECALL  BECAUSE OF THE GASKET PROBLEM I TOOK MY 1995 SABLE TO A FORD DEALER FOR CORRECTION. THE CAR IS NOT USED TOO MUCH, AND CONSEQUENTLY THE TIME EXTENSION(TO 7 YEARS) RAN OUT, BUT WITH ONLY 28,000 MILES ON THE NEW GASKETS (72,000 MILES TOTAL ON THE VEHICLE), THEY FAILED LAST MONTH. FORD HAS NO INTEREST IN PROVIDING ANY RELIEF. MILEAGE TO THEM IS IRRELEVANT, ONLY THE TIME. PRETTY LOUSY APPROACH TO FIXING AN ENGINEERING DESIGN FLAW. PURCHASES OF FORD PRODUCTS ARE  A THING OF THE PAST. JUST HAD TO ENTER A FORMAL COMPLAINT AND GET IT OFF MY CHEST. IF YOU CAN USE ME AS ANY KIND OF A WITNESS AGAINST THEM GIVE A CALL.  *AK",
