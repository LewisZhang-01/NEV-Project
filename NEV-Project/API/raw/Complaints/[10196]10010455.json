THE CAR ACCELERATED DOWN DRIVEWAY AND DOWN MY NEIGHBORS HILL. THE CAR WAS STOPPED BY A TREE. WHEN THE CAR WAS TOWED OUT, THE WHEELS WERE PERFECTLY STRAIGHT. THE DEALER COULD FIND NO PROBLEM. DRIVER APPLIED BOTH FEET TO THE BRAKES BUT BRAKES DID NOT RESPOND. IT WAS VERY FORTUNATE THAT NO ONE WAS INJURED. THERE WAS EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO REAR OF CAR.   *JB",
