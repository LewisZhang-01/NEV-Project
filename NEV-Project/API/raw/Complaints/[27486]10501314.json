I TRIED TO PRESS EVERYWHERE ON THE RED CIRCLE TO GET HER OUT. IMPOSSIBLE. THANK GOD WE WERE NOT IN A CAR ACCIDENT AS I MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET HER OUT. WE BOUGHT THE CAR SEAT FOR 300.00 DOLLARS AND I CANT BELIEVE SHE GOT STUCK IN HER CAR SEAT. I CAN NOT CONTACT GRACO AS THEY ARE CLOSED SO I WILL HAVE TO CALL THEM TOMORROW. THIS IS BEYOND DANGEROUS. WE HAD TO CUT THE STRAPS TO GET HER OUT.   *TR",
