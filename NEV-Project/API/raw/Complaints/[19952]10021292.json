        "summary": "WHEN THE ACCELERATOR IS PRESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF PASSING OR FOR MERGING INTO TRAFFIC AT VARYING SPEEDS BETWEEN 25-50 MPH, THE VEHICLE \"LAGS\" OR ENCOUNTERS A DEAD SPOT BEFORE RESPONDING (BY SUDDENLY SPEEDING OFF).  THE VEHICLE SEEMS TO BE ATTEMPTING TO DECIDE HOW TO RESPOND TO THE ACTION OF THE ACCELERATOR BEING PRESSED (WHETHER TO REMAIN IN THE CURRENT GEAR, OR DOWN-SHIFT FOR QUICK ACCELERATION).  THE 'RPMS' WILL RISE EXTREMELY HIGH, BEFORE THE TRANSMISSION FIGURES OUT WHAT GEAR TO SHIFT INTO IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUEST OF THE DRIVER'S ACTION.  THIS 'LAG PERIOD' IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TIME FOR THE VEHICLE'S OCCUPANTS AS THE VEHICLE DOES NOT RESPOND LIKE NORMAL VEHICLES CONFRONTED WITH A \"WIDE-OPEN-THROTTLE\" REQUEST DO.  IF MY WIFE, WHO IS NO \"CAR BUFF\" AND GENERALLY DOES NOT PAY ATTENTION TO  ANYTHING BUT STARTING THE VEHICLE, HAS ALSO BROUGHT THIS ISSUE TO MY ATTENTION, THEN I KNOW THERE IS DEFINITELY A PROBLEM.  AS THE PROBLEM PRESENTS ITSELF AS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE FOR MY FAMILY, I HAVE CONTACTED LEXUS CUSTOMER SERVICE WHO HAVE ADVISED ME THAT \"LEXUS IS ATTEMPTING TO DEVELOP A FIX FOR THE CONCERN THAT MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION\". I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS \"FIX\" FOR OVER 7 MONTHS NOW, AND THE EXPECTED DATE KEEPS BEING PUSHED BACK!  PLEASE TAKE SOME ACTION REGARDING THIS SERIOUS ISSUE, AS THERE ARE MANY OTHER LEXUS OWNERS WHO WERE IN THE \"PASSIONATE PURSUIT OF PERFECTION\" (LEXUS SLOGAN), BUT HAVE NOT TAKEN THE TIME TO FILE A COMPLAINT!!*AK",
