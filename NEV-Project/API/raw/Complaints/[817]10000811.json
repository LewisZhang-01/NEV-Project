WAS ABLE TO ESTIMATE A FULL REBUILD AND UNKNOWN REPAIRS TO THE TRANSMISSION FRONT PUMP ASSEMBLY AT $1800-$2200 TO REPAIR THE CONDITION. ALTHOUGH CONFRONTED WITH THE EXTENSIVE VOLUME OF INFORMATION RELATED TO PROBLEMS WITH THIS TRANSMISSION OVER THE LAST DOZEN YEARS, BOTH THE DEALER AND CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE REFUSED TO ASSUME ANY SORT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR REPAIR.  *JB",
