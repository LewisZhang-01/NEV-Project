AT STOP, WHEN GAS PEDAL IS PRESSED, THE CAR DOES NOT ACCELERATE FOR 2-3 SEC, THEN IT \"JUMPS\"  - IN MAY, CAR WAS TAKEN TO PORSCHE DEALERSHIP. DEALER STATED THAT THIS LAG IS NORMAL AFTER FIX, EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NO SUCH LAG BEFORE FIX  - PORSCHE DEALERSHIP INSTALLED LATEST SOFTWARE ON THE CAR IN MAY. AFTER THAT, LAG DECREASED FROM 2-3SEC TO 2 SEC. BUT THE CAR STILL HAS ABNORMAL LAG  - IT FEELS UNSAFE TO DRIVE THE CAR, WHEN MERGING TO ROUNDABOUTS, WHEN MERGING FROM THE STOP  - A COMPLAINT WAS FILED WITH PORSCHE CARS OF AMERICA. REQUIREMENT OF NO \"... NOTICEABLE CHANGES TO THE DRIVING CHARACTERISTICS\" WAS DISCUSSED. PORSCHE SAID THAT THE PERFORMANCE IS \"AS DESIGNED\"  - CLEARLY, WHEN CAR WAS PURCHASED IN 2014, THERE WAS NO LAG. THAT'S WHEN THE CAR PERFORMED AS DESIGNED.  - EMISSION FIX NOTICEABLY CHANGED CAR DRIVING CHARACTERISTICS, IT MADE THE CAR FEEL UNSAFE. PRESSING GAS PEDAL FROM STOP DOES NOT RESULT IN SMOOTH POWER DELIVERY, IT IS NOT CLEAR IF THE CAR WILL DRIVE OR NOT FOR 2 SEC",
