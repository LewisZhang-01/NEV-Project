        "summary": "OWNER OF 1998 MAZDA 626-CAR JUST TURNED 67K MILES.  WITH CRUISE CONTROL SET ON 75 ON THE INTERSTATE THE O/D OFF LIGHT CAME ON AND STARTED BLINKING.  TURNED CAR OFF FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THE LIGHT WENT AWAY.  NEXT DAY THE TRANSMISSION STARTED SLIPPING.  THE MAZDA DEALERSHIP SAYS THE O/D OFF LIGHT BLINKING MEANS THE TRANSMISSION IS OVER HEATING.  (HOW IN THE BLUE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THE OVERDRIVE OFF LIGHT BLINKING MEANS A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM?)  DEALERS FIRST RESPONSE WAS TO REBUILD TRANSMISSION, I PUSHED BACK AND TOLD HIM TO TRY SOMETHING ELSE, THEY DID A TRANSMISSION FLUSH FOR $130 AND HE SAYS THAT SEEMED TO STOP THE PROBLEM FOR NOW.  GIVEN ALL THE OTHER COMPLAINTS FOR THE SAME ISSUE WILL BE SELLING THE VEHICLE:  I CANNOT BELIEVE THERE IS NOT A RECALL ON THIS.  IT SEEMS THAT EVERYONE IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY KNOWS THIS IS A DEFECTIVE PART THAT GOES OUT.    *NLM",
