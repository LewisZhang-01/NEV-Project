DOORS EXCEPT FOR THE DRIVERS DOOR WOULD NOT OPEN EVEN USING THE INSIDE DOOR HANDLES.  THE DRIVERS DOOR HAD TO BE OPENED FROM THE OUTSIDE USING THE KEY.  MY WIFE AND I WERE LOCKED IN THE CAR IN TEMPERATURES EXCEEDING 100 DEGREES.  WE DID NOT EVEN REALIZE THE LOCKS DID NOT WORK UNTIL WE RETURNED HOME FROM A BRIEF TRIP.  HAD WE BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE CAR.  THE GAS FILLER DOOR IS LINKED TO THE DOOR LOCKS AND WOULD ALSO NOT OPEN.  IT SEEMED THAT THE DOOR LOCKS ARE ONLY ELECTRONICALLY CONTROLLED WITH NO MANUAL LINKAGE SINCE LIFTING THE BUTTON ON THE DOOR DID NOT UNLOCK THE DOOR.  AFTER FINALLY GETTING OUT OF THE CAR I DID SOME QUICK RESEARCH ONLINE AND FOUND THIS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM.  THE FUSE HAD BLOWN SO I REPLACED THE FUSE BUT I AM SURE IT WILL FAIL AGAIN.  CANNOT TRUST THE CAR NOW SO WILL BE GETTING RID OF IT.  THIS IS A DANGEROUS DESIGN WHEN THE DOORS WILL NOT OPEN FROM THE INSIDE WHEN THERE IS AN ELECTRICAL FAILURE.  *TR",
