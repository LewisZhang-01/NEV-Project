ONE OF MY COIL PACKS WENT WHILE TURNING ONTO MAIN ROAD AND CAUSING MY CAR TO SPUTTER AND LOSE POWER. ON COMING TRAFFIC HAD SLAM ON THEIR BRAKES TO AVOID HITTING ME. THANKFULLY AN ACCIDENT WAS AVERTED. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. THESE COIL PACKS ARE FAILING AT EPIDEMIC LEVELS. MAJOR NEWSPAPERS ARE DOING ARTICLES ON THIS PROBLEM.      MY CAR HAD TO BE TOWED WHILE I WAITED IN FREEZING TEMPERATURES AND I MISSED WORK. VW WILL ONLY REPLACE BAD COIL PACKS AS THEY FAIL AND MY DEALER ADMITS THAT IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. THEY REPLACED THE BAD COIL PACK BUT I STILL HAVE 3  THAT ARE GOING TO FAIL AT SOME POINT. CAN YOU IMAGINE LIVING WITH THIS IN YOUR MIND? PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION.   *JB",
