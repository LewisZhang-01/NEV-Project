        "summary": "JANUARY 24, 2003    TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,    I OWN A 1999DODGE INTREPID ES WITH 40,244 MILES ON THE ODOMETER.  I AM AN ''AVERAGE'' CAR USER AND HAVE FOLLOWED THE MANUFACTURERS RECOMMENDED MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE.    ON THURSDAY 1/16/03 AS I WAS GETTING OUT OF THE DRIVERS SEAT OF MY VEHICLE I FELT SOMETHING ''SNAP''.  I SAT BACK DOWN IN THE SEAT AND THE ELECTRONIC POSITIONING SYSTEM WOULD NO LONGER ADJUST THE SEATBACK AND THE BACK ITSELF SEEMED TO REST AT A BIT OF AN ANGLE FROM LEFT TO RIGHT AS WELL AS LEANING BACK FARTHER THAN IT SHOULD.     ON MONDAY 1/20/03 I TOOK MY CAR TO DON MILLER DODGE WEST, A SERVICE GARAGE AND DODGE DEALERSHIP IN MADISON WISCONSIN FOR AN INSPECTION OF THE SEAT.  I WAS TOLD THAT ONE OF THE BOLTS ON THE SEAT BASE HAD BROKEN OFF THEREFORE PUTTING ALL OF THE FORCE ON THE REMAINING BOLT ON OTHER SIDE OF THE SEAT BASE.  I ASKED IF THIS WAS A SAFETY RISK AND IF IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE, IF NOT REPAIRED, FOR THE SEAT BACK TO BREAK EVEN FURTHER AND LITERALLY FALL INTO THE BACK SEAT.  I WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS A POSSIBILITY.  THE REPAIR IS GOING TO COST ME MORE THAN $1000 FOR PARTS AND LABOR.    I BELIEVE THAT THE BOLT WAS DEFECTIVE AND I AM WRITING TO YOU BECAUSE I''M CONCERNED THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF OTHER DEFECTIVE BOLTS IN IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR VEHICLES COULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE FOR THE OWNERS.   I WAS LUCKY THAT THE BOLT BROKE WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS TURNED OFF AND PARKED IN MY GARAGE.  I AM WORRIED THAT OTHER OWNERS OF INTREPIDS OR SIMILARLY MANUFACTURED VEHICLES (CONCORDES) MAY EXPERIENCE SUCH A DEFECT WHILE DRIVING WITH EVEN MORE DIRE OUTCOMES THAN A $1000+ REPAIR BILL.    I HAVE WRITTEN TO DAIMLERCHRYSLER COMPANY TO ALERT THEM TO THE PROBLEM (AND ALSO ASKED FOR ASSISTANCE WITH THE REPAIR COST) BUT I DO NOT KNOW IF THEY ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT SUCH PROBLEMS TO YOU, HENCE THIS LETTER.    SINCERELY,    WILLIAM T. PAUL",
