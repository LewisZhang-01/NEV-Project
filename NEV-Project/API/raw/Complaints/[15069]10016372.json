BASED ON THE AGE OF THE TRUCK, IT APPEARS TO ME THAT IT IS A LITTLE PREMATURE TO BE REPLACING A STRAP, ESPECIALLY ON SOMETHING AS CRITICAL AS A FUEL TANK.  I HAVE ALSO READ THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING LINKAGE, HOWEVER I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANY RECALL NOTICE FROM PETERBILT OR ANYONE ELSE.  WHAT DO I NEED TO LOOK FOR TO SEE IF IT APPLIES TO MY TRUCK?      *JB",
