        "summary": "SUBJECT:AIRBAG FAILURE   COMMENTS: TWICE NOW MY SON HAS HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH HIS 2002 MUSTANG AND THE AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY. FORTUNATELY HE WAS NOT HURT. MY MAJOR CONCERN IS THAT I HAD THE AIRBAG SPECIFICALLY TESTED AT THE REPAIR SHOP AT THE LAST REPAIR BEFORE ACCEPTING DELIVERY OF THE CAR. I WAS TOLD SOMEONE IS HIRED BY THE REPAIR SHOP TO COME OUT AND RUN TESTS BY HOOKING UP INSTRUMENTS TO THE CAR AND GETTING A READ OUT. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THIS WAS DONE BUT MY SON JUST HAD HIS 2ND ACCIDENT AND HIS CAR HIT A CONCRETE BARRIER AT BETTER THAN 40 MPH AND THE AIRBAG STILL DID NOT DEPLOY. I HAVE REPORTED IT TO CONSUMER SERVICE AT THE FORD WEBSITE BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED A RESPONSE. I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MY SON'S FUTURE USE OF THIS CAR AND THAT FACT THAT MY WIFE OWNS AN IDENTICAL MUSTANG OF THE SAME MANUFACTURED YEAR OF 2002. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY OTHER CASES WHERE THE AIRBAG HAS NOT DEPLOYED WHEN IT WAS EXPECTED TOO AND WHO CAN I CONTACT ABOUT FURTHER ACTION TO TAKE? VERY CONCERNED, CHRIS KOSS FROM NHTSA WEB SITE.   *JB",
