OIL PRESSURE GAUGE WILL GO TO ZERO. TRUCK IS TURNED OFF AND OIL CHECKED, CONFIRMING CORRECT OIL LEVEL. UPON RESTARTING OF TRUCK THE PRESSURE RETURNS TO NORMAL.   WHEN THE PRESSURE GAUGE BOTTOMS OUT THE VALVES WILL BEGIN TO TAP SHORTLY AFTER IF THE TRUCK IS NOT IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN.   THIS HAS OCCURRED 4 TIMES WITHIN 2 DAYS AND HAS SINCE BEEN TAKEN TO MY MECHANIC. PER A CONVERSATION WITH THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE, THEY DO NOT WISH TO GET INVOLVED AS THEY ARE NOT A DODGE DEALER.   I NEED SOME SORT OF ASSISTANCE; JUDGING BY ALL THE OTHER REPORTS ON THIS PROBLEM MY ENGINE IS DUE TO FAIL AND THERE IS NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT!!!    *NLM",
