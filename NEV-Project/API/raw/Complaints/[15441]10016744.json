        "summary": "STARTING AT ABOUT 10,000 MILES THERE WAS A VERY DISTINCT RUBBING SOUND WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES IN A NON-EMERGENCY SITUATION (IT REMINDED ME OF THE SOUND BRAKES MAKE WHEN THEY HAVE TOO MUCH WEAR AND USUALLY IT'S AN INDICATION THE BRAKES NEED TO BE RELPACED).  AT ABOUT 15,000 MILES I HAD THE CAR SERVICED AND THE DEALER STATED NO PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES.  AT ABOUT 29,500 I HAD TO HAVE THE BRAKES AND ROTORS REPLACED.  ABOUT 5,000 MILES AFTER THE BRAKES AND ROTORS WERE REPLACED THE SOUND HAS STARTED AGAIN.  IT SOUNDS AS IF THE ABS IS CONSTANTLY ENGAGED BUT THIS HAPPENS WHENEVER PRESSURE IS APPLIED TO THE BRAKES.  I'M CONVINCED THERE IS A BRAKE PROBLEM THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR AND I'M CONCERNED THE BRAKES WILL FAIL IN AN EMERGENCY.  THE DEALERS SEEM UNABLE TO IDENTIFY A PROBLEM.  DOES YOUR AGENCY HAVE ANY RECORDS OF BRAKE PROBLEMS WITH THE 2001 BUICK REGAL GS?",
