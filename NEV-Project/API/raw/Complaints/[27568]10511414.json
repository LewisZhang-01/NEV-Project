I WAS ABLE TO PUT CAR IN NEUTRAL AND MOVE OVER TO THE SHOULDER. TURNED CAR OFF, THEN BACK ON AND THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO BE FIXED. CALLED FORD DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID IT SOUNDS LIKE MY ELECTRONIC THROTTLE CONTROL AS THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE IN MY VEHICLE. THIS FIX IS NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY OR RECALLED BY FORD. NOT ONLY THAT BUT I WAS NOT NOTIFIED BY FORD THAT THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE AND SHOULD GET IT FIXED (AS IT NEARLY CAUSED AN ACCIDENT ON EXPRESSWAY). TWO DAYS LATER SAME ISSUE HAPPENED AGAIN. LUCKILY NO TRAFFIC WAS NEARBY AS THIS MAY HAVE CAUSED YET ANOTHER ACCIDENT.  *TR",
