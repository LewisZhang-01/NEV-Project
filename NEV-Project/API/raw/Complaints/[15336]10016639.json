THIS HAS HAPPENED 3 TIMES WITHIN THE PAST YEAR, ALL INCIDENTS OCCURRED AROUND 40 MPH.  I NOTICED THE CAR USUALLY DOWNSHIFTS AT THIS SPEED, BUT HAD NOT BEFORE EACH OF THESE INCIDENTS HAD OCCURRED.  THE CAR HAS LESS THAN 30K MILES.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER, THEY DID NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG AND COULD NOT REPRODUCE.  I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS INDEPENDENTLY AND FOUND THAT 4 CYLINDER MAZDA'S HAVE HAD SIMILAR TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS SINCE THE SWITCH TO FORD TRANSMISSIONS IN 1994/1995!!  I FEEL MAZDA SHOULD HAVE ADDRESSED THIS LONG AGO AND THAT THEIR DEALERSHIPS SHOULD BE WELL AWARE OF THE PROBLEM.    *NLM",
