I TOOK IT TO A DEALER, WHERE SOME KIND OF COMPUTER WAS REPROGRAMMED, BUT I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT MAZDA  HAS NO FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM, ONLY A CHECKLIST OF THINGS THAT THEY TRY. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS DEFECT, AND I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE IS NOT SOME KIND OF IMMEDIATE RECALL ON THIS PROBLEM. SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET HURT! SHORT OF A FIRE, MAJOR STRUCTURAL FAILURE, OR TIRE BLOWOUT, I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE DANGEROUS, OR I SHOULD SAY EQUALLY DANGEROUS, THAN TO BE SUDDENLY LEFT WITHOUT ANY POWER OR ABILITY TO STEER. WITH TRAFFIC, HIGHWAY SPEEDS, OR CURVE ROADS (WHICH A BOUND MOUNTAINS HOME STATE), THIS IS A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN. *TS *JB  ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12-12-02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS***761982",
