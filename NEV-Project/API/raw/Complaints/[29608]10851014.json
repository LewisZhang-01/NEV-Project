PRIOR TO THAT WE HAD NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER WITH THE STEERING.  4 MONTHS LATER THE STEERING HAS FAILED.  FROM WHAT I AM READING AT SEVERAL LOCATIONS ON THE INTERNET THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM.  I AM ASKING THE NHTSA TO LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM CLOSER.  MY OPINION IS THERE SHOULD BE AN ADDITIONAL RECALL THAT ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE.  IF YOU'VE HAD A SIMILAR ISSUE I URGE YOU TO CONTACT FORD AND FILE A COMPLAINT AND CONTACT THE NHTSA AND VOICE YOUR CONCERN.  I WAS TOLD BY FORD IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX THE VEHICLE AND THEY ARE OFFERING NO ASSISTANCE.",
