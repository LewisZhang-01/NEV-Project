        "summary": "IN AUGUST 2002,UPON STARTING THE VEHICLE, THE STEERING COLUMN LOCKED UP AND WOULD NOT MOVE. A MESSAGE WAS RECEIVED INDICATING STEERING COLUMN LOCK. I WAS FORCED TO CALL A TOW TRUCK TO TAKE ME TO THE DEALER. BECAUSE OF THE PARKED POSITION OF THE VEHICLE AND THE INABILITY TO MOVE THE WHEEL IN ANY DIRECTION, THE ONLY OPTION AVAILABLE FOR US TO LOAD THE VEHICLE WAS TO BACK IT INTO AN ACTIVE ROADWAY. I HAD THE PART REPLACED BY MAIL. CHEVROLET DEALER WHO INDICATED THAT THEY HAD SEEN THIS PROBLEM BEFORE, BUT IT HAD NOT BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A RECALL. A SEARCH OF THE WEB INDICATED THAT THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM ON OTHER CORVETTE'S. I SUBSEQUENTLY CONTACTED GENERAL MOTORS SEEKING COMPENSATION FOR THE REPAIR COSTS. THEY HAVE BEEN NON-RESPONSIVE TO TWO LETTERS. I AM GREATLY CONCERNED THAT THIS STEERING COLUMN LOCK UP COULD OCCUR AT SPEED AND WOULD CONSTITUTE A SERIOUS RISK.     ---DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS---769752. *AK  REF.
