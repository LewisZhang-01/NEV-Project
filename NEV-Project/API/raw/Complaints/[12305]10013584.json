ALL THE OTHERS HAVE BEEN MOMENTARY LASTING LESS THAN A SECOND. ALL CASES WERE AFTER I ACCELERATED, THE PEDAL WOULD NOT COME BACK. THE CAR HAS BEEN IN NUMEROUS TIMES FOR THIS PROBLEM TO THE DEALER WHO CAN NEVER FIND ANYTHING WRONG. THEY HAVE DOCUMENTED  THE PROBLEM THOUGH. MY LAST TIME IN I DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THE LEMON LAW. I FINALLY HAD AN ACCIDENT LAST FRIDAY EVENING PULLING OFF FROM A LIGHT WHEN THE PEOPLE IN FRONT OF ME SUDDENLY BRAKED AND MY CAR KEPT GOING.  *JB",
