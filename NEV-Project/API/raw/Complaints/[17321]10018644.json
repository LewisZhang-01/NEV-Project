SINCE THEN I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER FOR EVALUATING A PROBLEM WITH THE LEFT SIDE SLIDING PASSENGER DOOR. THIS HAPPENED ON 3 OCCASIONS WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS UNDER WARRANTY AND TWICE AFTER WARRANTY PERIOD. THE PROBLEM RECURS SHORTLY AFTER EACH VISIT. NOW THE DEALER WANTS ME TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS WITHOUT ANY ASSURANCE THAT THE PROBLEM WOULD NOT RECUR. I NEED TO KNOW IF THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR OTHER VEHICLE OWNERS AS WELL AND WHAT I CAN DO ABOUT IT.       *JB",
