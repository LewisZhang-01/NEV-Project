IT COMES IN WAY TO EARLY AND SOMETIMES EVEN WHERE THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY PROBLEM BRAKING. DURING ROUTINE BRAKING, THE ABS WILL ENGAGE RESULTING IN A LOSS OF BRAKE POWER AND THUS A LONGER BRAKING DISTANCE. I HAVE DRIVEN MANY CARS WITH ABS AND THIS CAR'S SYSTEM IS NOT NORMAL. I BELIEVE THIS IS A \"NORMAL\" PROBLEM WITH WRXS AND THE PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE FIXED.  *JB",
