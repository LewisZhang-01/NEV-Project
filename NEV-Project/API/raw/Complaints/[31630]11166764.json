AFTER GOING OVER A SERIES OF SMALL BUMPS ON A HIGHWAY AT 65-70MPH, MY JEEP WENT INTO A VIOLENT SHAKING EPISODE. I ACTUALLY THOUGHT ONE OF THE WHEELS WAS COMING OFF. THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THIS COULD BE REPAIRED BY REPLACING THE STABILIZER BAR WITH A HEAVIER DUTY ONE.  THEY DID THE REPAIR. ON FRIDAY OF LAST WEEK, I HAD 6 EPISODES OF THE DEATH WOBBLE IN ONE DAY. THE DEALER IS TAKING MY JEEP BACK IN TOMORROW TO LOOK AT IT AGAIN. THIS MIGHT BE THE SCARIEST THING I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN MY 30+ YEARS OF DRIVING.",
