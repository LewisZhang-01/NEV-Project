        "summary": "I WOULD LIKE TO PLACE A COMPLAINT ON RECORD ABOUT THE POOR QUALITY OF THE CADILLAC CATERA. THESE VEHICLES SHOULD HAVE ALL BEEN BOUGHT BACK BY GM TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC FROM THEIR POOR QUALITY. I HAVE A 1998 CADILLAC CATERA ,WELL CARED FOR. OVER THE PAST YEAR THOUGH THE CAR HAS BEGUN TO LEAK OIL HEAVILY,TO THE POINT OF ACTUALLY BEING AN ENVIROMENTAL HAZARD. THE OTHER DAY I TOOK IT TO A LOCAL CADILLAC DEALER ONLY TO BE TOLD THE CAR HAS LEAKING VALVE COVER GASKETS,CAM COVER GASKETS AND AN OIL COOLING LINE. THEY SAY $1200 WILL SEAL UP MOST OF THE LEAKS. THE CAR ONLY HAS AN ORIGINAL 65,000 MILES ON IT. UPON HEARING THIS I DID AN INTERNET SEARCH ON CATERAS AND THE HORROR STORIES ARE ENDLESS. IT SEEMS THEY ALL INCLUDING MINE HAVE BROKEN HEADLIGHT ALIGNERS. THIS IS APPARENTLY CAUSED BY HEAT AND CHEAP MANUFACTURING. THIS OFF COURSE MAKES THE HEADLIGHTS IMPOSSIBLE TO ALIGN AND AIM.IT ALSO SEEMS THAT ALL CATERAS WEAR OUT TIRES IN A VERY RAPID TIME FRAME DUE TO POOR FRONT END DESIGN. MY 1998 HAS ALL THESE PROBLEMS PLUS ALL FOUR RADIO SPEAKERS HAVE BLOWN ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NEVER PLAYED LOUDLY. THE HEADLIGHT LENSES HAVE HEAVILY YELLOWED OVER THUS REDUCING GREATLY THE HEADLIGHT POWER. I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU REVIEW ACCIDENTS INVOLVING CATERAS AS THEY COULD EASILY RELATE TO THE ALL TO COMMON HEADLIGHT ADJUSTMENT PROBLEM ON THESE CARS NOT TO MENTION THE OIL BLOW BY FROM THE ENGINE ONTO THE FRONT BRAKE ROTORS. PLEASE HELP GET THESE CARS OFF THE ROAD.",
