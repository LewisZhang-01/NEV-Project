FORTUNATELY FOR US,  IT DID NOT CAUSE ANY DAMAGE TO THE TRUCK OR HIT ANY CARS IN THE AREA, AFTER IT BROKE FREE AND TRAVELED OVER 50 YARDS ACROSS A BUSY HIGHWAY. SINCE THE SPARE IS APPROXIMATELY 50 LBS AND 30 INCHES IN DIAMETER, IT COULD HAVE CAUSED SOME VERY SERIOUS PROBLEMS. THIS IS DEFINITELY A DESIGN PROBLEM AND SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED. IT'S POSSIBLE THE CABLE HOLDING THE SPARE SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH SOMETHING HEAVIER.   *NLM",
