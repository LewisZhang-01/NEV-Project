THIS IS EXTRAORDINARILY DANGEROUS DURING ANY BUT THE SLOWEST, STRAIGHT AHEAD DRIVING, AS IT RESULTS IN A NEARLY COMPLETE LOSS OF MANEUVERABILITY.  IN THE EVENT OF SUCH A COMPLETE SHUTDOWN THE VEHICLE CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY ACCELERATED, BRAKED, OR TURNED, AND LIGHTS AND WINDSHIELD WIPERS ALSO FAIL.   FURTHERMORE, THE WINDSHIELD WIPER DELAY MALFUNCTIONS CONTINUOUSLY IN COLD WEATHER, RESULTING IN COMPLETE LOSS OF WIPER FUNCTION AT TIMES.  MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS AT DIAGNOSIS AND REPAIR, INCLUDING SOME PARTS REPLACEMENT BY THE DEALER, HAVE FAILED TO ELIMINATE ANY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED PROBLEMS.",
