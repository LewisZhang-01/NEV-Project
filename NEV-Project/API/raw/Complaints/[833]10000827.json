THEN THE COLD WEATHER COMES AND NOW I GET ONLY 35MPG IN THE CITY THAT IS A DROP OF OVER 28%.       I HAVE TAKEN IT BACK TWICE TO THE DEALER AND THEY SUPPOSELY SCOPE IT AND SAID THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG AND THAT THE COLD WEATHER WAS THE PROBLEM.  I TOLD THEM THAT THEIR EXCUSE WAS LAME AND THAT WAS NOT EXCEPTABLE.  IF A CARS GAS MILEAGE DROPS THAT DRAMACTICLY THERE HAS TO BE A PROBLEM OR THEIR IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT.  THERE SHOULD NOT BE A 28% DROP OFF IN A CAR PERFORMANCE IN COLD WEATHER.    THERE ADVERTISEMENT PITCH WAS THAT THE CAR WILL GET BETTER MILEAGE IN THE CITY THAN THE HIGHWAY BECAUSE OF THEIR HYBRID SYSTEM, IT DID NOT SAY THAT THE SYSTEM ONLY WORK IN WARM WEATHER",
