IT HAPPENS MOST OFTEN IN THE MORNING, COLD SEEMS TO BE A FACTOR MOST OF THE TIME, AND IT SHUDDERS WHEN YOU GO FROM STOP TO GO. FIRST GEAR IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET OUT OF SMOOTHLY WITHOUT THE SHUDDERING. THE DEALER CANT SEEM TO REPLICATE THE PROBLEM, BUT I HAVE READ THE OTHER SUBARU OWNERS COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME PROBLEM ON THE SUBARU MESSAGE BOARD, SO I KNOW ITS MORE OF A PROBLEM THAN JUST OUR CAR. *TS  ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12-12-02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS***761667",
