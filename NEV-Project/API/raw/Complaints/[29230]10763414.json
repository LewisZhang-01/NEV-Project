I ALSO RECEIVED A LETTER FROM THE DEALERSHIP, FREMONT CALIFORNIA CHRYSLER DODGE JEEP, IN JUNE TO INFORM ME THAT MY CAR WAS AFFECTED BY AIRBAG RECALL R25 / NHTSA 15V-313, AND THAT I SHOULD WAIT FOR THEM TO CONTACT ME WHEN PARTS BECAME AVAILABLE.  THEY NEVER CONTACTED ME.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP TWICE IN EARLY SEPTEMBER AND WAS TOLD THEY COULD ONLY ADD MY NAME TO A WAITING LIST.  I CALLED AGAIN AND LEFT A MESSAGE WITH THE PARTS DESK TO PLEASE CONTACT ME TO LET ME KNOW WHEN I WOULD GET PARTS. THEY DID NOT RETURN MY CALL.  I SENT A WRITTEN MESSAGE TO THE DEALERSHIP REGARDING THIS ISSUE, AND RECEIVED NO RESPONSE OR RETURNED CALL.  I AM FILING THIS COMPLAINT BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR OVER THREE MONTHS, AND THEY WILL NOT RESPOND OR RESOLVE THE ISSUE - THIS IS AN UNREASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO WAIT FOR A SAFETY RELATED RECALL REPAIR.",
