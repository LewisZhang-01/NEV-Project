IT CATCHES ON THE HARD PLASTIC ON THE FRONT LEFT OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT.  THE FIRST THREE TIMES I WAS EXITING THE CAR IN TOWN AND COULD HAVE FALLEN INTO PASSING TRAFFIC HAD I NOT BEEN HOLDING ONTO THE DOOR.  THE LAST TIME MY SISTER WAS STANDING IN FRONT OF ME AND CAUGHT ME.  I HAVE TRIED TO LOCATE SEAT COVERS TO COVER THE PIECE OF HARD PLASTIC WITH NO LUCK.  ANY SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE HELPFUL.  THE DESIGN CERTAINLY NEEDS TO BE CHANGED.",
