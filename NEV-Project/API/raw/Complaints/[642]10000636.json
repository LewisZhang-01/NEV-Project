I COULD NOT GET THE MOTOR TO SHUT DOWN UNTIL I EITHER PULLED THE ABS FUSE, OR DISCONNECTED THE MOTOR UNDER THE TRUCK.  I HAVE TALKED TO THE LOCAL DEALRER AND HE HAS HAD SEVERAL ISSUES LIKE THIS AS WELL AS MANY THAT ARE DOUCUMENTED ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE.  DUE TO THE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS AND SEFVERITY OF THIS ISSUE I THINK THAT GMC NEEDS TO ISSUE A RECALL ON THIS SYSTEM. RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED, GARY EASLEY",
