THIS PROBLEM OCCURS MAINLY IN THE SUMMER MONTHS OR TIMES WHEN THE TEMPERATURE IS WARMER.  THIS PROBLEM BEGAN ABOUT A YEAR TO A YEAR AND A HALF AFTER I BOUGHT THE VAN WHEN IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY, AND THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS TODAY.  I HAD TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG.  THE DEALER SAID THE POPPING NOISE WAS THE BRAKE CYLINDERS EXPANDING ONTO THE PADS TO STOP THE VAN.  IT IS ODD THOUGH BECAUSE THE FRONT END POPS WHEN I AM TURNING THE WHEEL AT A VERY SLOW SPEED WHEN I AM NOT APPLYING THE BRAKES.  *NLM",
