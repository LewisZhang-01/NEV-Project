        "summary": "THERE IS EXCESSIVE HEAT COMING FROM THE ENGINE WHICH BURNS ON THE INNER THIGH JUST TO THE RIGHT OF THE SEAT. I PURCHASED THE BIKE YESTERDAY AND WAS TOLD BY DEALER THAT AFTER 1000 MILES I NEED TO CHANGE THE OIL WITH SYNTHETIC OIL. I WAS ALSO TOLD I MUST PURCHASE LEXAN ENGINE GUARDS. I BURNED MY INNER THIGH YESTERDAY WHILE I WAS STOPPED AT A STOP LIGHT. I WAS WEARING THICK JEANS AS WELL. IT GOT SO HOT I ALMOST DROPPED THE MOTORCYCLE. WHEN RIDING IN STOP-AND-GO TRAFFIC THE PROBLEM BECOMES EVEN WORSE. THIS IS CLEARLY A SAFETY ISSUE TO BOTH OPERATOR AND THOSE TRAVELING AROUND THE MOTORCYCLE. IF THE MOTORCYCLE IS TOO HOT TO HANDLE THE OPERATOR BECOMES FOCUSED ON NOT GETTING BURNED RATHER THAN THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT. THE POTENTIAL FOR AN ACCIDENT IS RAISED SIGNIFICANTLY. SECONDARY, TO BURN POTENTIAL IS THE POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO THE PIPES THROUGH BLUING AND EXCESSIVE HEAT. A CONSUMER PAYS A PREMIUM PRICE FOR A HD PRODUCT AND WOULD EXPECT THAT THESE SAFETY AND MAINTENANCE ISSUES WOULD BE PROPERLY ADDRESSED BY THE MANUFACTURER INSTEAD OF MAKING THE CUSTOMER PAY FOR THE FIX OF THIS PROBLEM. *JB",
