THIS HOWEVER WENT AWAY WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS SHUT DOWN AT HOME AND NEVER CAME BACK TILL TODAY JAN. 8TH, 2015 WHEN THERE WAS A PASSENGER BUT AGAIN WENT OFF AND STAYED OFF AFTER A 5.9 MILE TRIP, THE DASH INDICATOR READ PASSENGER SYSTEM WAS NOT ENGAGED DURING SAID TRIP. THE STARTING MILEAGE ON THE SECOND INCIDENT WAS 129033.3 AND THE FIRST WAS APPROXIMATELY 410 MILES PRIOR. I CAN PROVIDE THIS NUMBER IF NEEDED AS IT WAS RECORDED FOR THE OIL CHANGE. THIS VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO TWO OTHER RECALLS ONE IS 13036 THE OTHER 14152, AND WHEN THE AIRBAG WARNING STARTED I WAS ALREADY AWAITING SERVICE ON THESE. AS I RECALL THE REPORTS RECENTLY IN THE NEWS RELATED TO FAILINGS IN THE PASSENGER SYSTEM AND THIS SEEMS TO BE TIED TO THAT SIDE AS IT DID NOT ENGAGE AS I READ IT.  *TR",
