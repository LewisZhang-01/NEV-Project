I RECENTLY HAD TO HAVE THE HEATER CORE REPLACED, WHICH REQUIRES REMOVING THE DASHBOARD.  THE DASHBOARD IS NOW FULL OF  HOLES AND LARGER CRACKS.  I BELIEVE IT POSES A DANGER TO ME AND ANY PASSENGER IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT, OR THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE PASSENGER AIRBAG WOULD LIKELY CAUSE THE DASH TO DO HARM TO ANYONE  HIT BY ANY PIECE OF IT.  I AM TOLD THAT DODGE IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND WILL DO NOTHING ABOUT CORRECTING IT.  *TR",
