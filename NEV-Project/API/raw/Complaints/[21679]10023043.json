IF YOU USE THE ELECTRICAL LOCK SYSTEM, THE DOORS DO NOT ELECTRONICALLY OPEN, YOU MUST MANUALLY PUSH THE LOCKS UP TO OPEN AND EXIT THE VEHICLE.  YOU CANNOT MANUALLY PUSH THE LOCKS UP TO EXIT THE VEHICLE UNLESS YOU HIT THE ELECTRIC DOOR BUTTON UP AND THEN AND ONLY THEN CAN YOU PUSH THE BUTTON UP AND THEN OPEN THE DOOR.  IF YOU DO NOT HIT THE ELECTRONIC BUTTON, WHICH DOES NOT ELECTRONICALLY UNLOCK THE DOORS BECAUSE IT HAS FAILED, THEN YOU CANNOT EVEN EXIT THE VEHICLE.  YOU ARE LOCKED IN, CANNOT ESCAPE. MANUALLY AS WELL AS ELECTRONIC DOOR LOCKING SYSTEM HAS FAILED.  IF AN ACCIDENT CAUSES THE DRIVER TO BE PINNED IN THE VEHICLE, OR UNCONSCIOUS OR THE VEHICLE MANGLED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT YOU COULD NOT PUSH THE ELECTRIC BUTTON UP, MY CHILDREN (8 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND 11 YEAR OLD SON) WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE.  WHAT IF THE VEHICLE WAS ON FIRE AND THEY COULDN'T GET OUT, IF WE WERE UNABLE TO PUSH THAT BUTTON OR THEY WERE UNABLE TO PUSH THAT ELECTRIC BUTTON UP, THE BUTTON MUST BE PUSHED BY THE DRIVER'S SIDE IN ORDER FOR IT TO ALLOW YOU TO UNLOCK THE VEHICLE, IT WOULD RESULT IN POSSIBLE DEATH.  WE TOLD DEALER, THEY WILL NOT FIX, THEY WANT TO CHARGE US $100.00 PER DOOR, I BARELY MAKE ENDS MEET, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  I HAVE TO DRIVE TO GET TO WORK, THE DEALER COULD CARE LESS.....WE SPOKE WITH CHRYSLER, THEY COULD CARE LESS AND THEY SAY THEY HAVE NOT HAD A FATALITY SO UNTIL THEY DO, THEY WILL NOT COVER THIS SAFETY ISSUE.  SOMEONE HAS TO BE INJURED OR DIE IN ORDER FOR THEM TO FIX VERY SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM.  YOU CANNOT GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE, BY MANUALLY TRYING TO UNLOCK THE DOORS, IF THE ELECTRONIC OPENER IS NOT PUSHED FIRST, THEN YOU CANNOT MANUALLY UNLOCK THE DOORS, THE DRIVERS ELECTRIC DOOR BUTTON MUST BE PUSHED UP, EVEN THOUGH IT DOES NOT MAKE THE DOORS ELECTRONICALLY UNLOCK, IF IT IS NOT AT LEAST PUSHED, YOU ARE LOCKED IN AND CANNOT UNLOCK THE DOORS BECAUSE THE LOCK WILL NOT GO UP....YOU ARE TRAPPED.    *NLM",
