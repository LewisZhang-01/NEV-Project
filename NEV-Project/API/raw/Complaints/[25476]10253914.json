WE PULLED OVER AND CHECKED THE TIRES FOR FLATS AND THERE WERE NONE.  WE THEN PHONED THE DEALERSHIP TO REPORT THIS NEW PROBLEM AS WE INFORMED THEM THAT WE WERE EXPERIENCING PROBLEM AFTER PROBLEM .  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT HAD COME BACK ON THE SAME DAY WE'D PICKED IT UP FOR THAT REPAIR AND REMAINED ON, ALONG W/NEW ISSUES.  WE WERE TOLD WE COULD BRING THE CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP ON TUESDAY, 12/23/08.  ON 12/22/08 AT APPROX., 0540 A.M., AS I WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE ON FWY 99, THE CAR BEGAN TREMBLING ONCE AGAIN.  I HEARD AN OVERWHELMING LOUD BANG AND THE VEHICLE COMPLETELY LOST CONTROL.  I SWERVED HEADING IN THE NE DIRECTION, AND HIT A SEMI-TRUCK WHICH WAS DRIVING UP ALONGSIDE OF MY VEHICLE.  AFTER HITTING INTO THE SIDE OF THE SEMI-TRUCK, THE VEHICLE TURNED FACING S IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FREEWAY FACING HEAVY ON-COMING TRAFFIC. THE SEMI-TRUCK HIT MY DRIVER'S LEFT DOOR WHICH KNOCKED MY VEHICLE OFF THE FREEWAY ONTO THE MEDIAN.  AS I ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE FURTHER INTO THE MEDIAN FOR SAFETY FROM ON-COMING TRAFFIC, THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE IN THE SLIGHTEST. AFTER TWO STRANGERS RAN TO MY VEHICLE PRIED THE DRIVER'S DOOR OPEN AND THEY PHYSICALLY ASSISTED ME OUT OF THE VEHICLE, I DISCOVERED THE ENTIRE BACK LEFT TIRE, RIM AND ALL HAD FALLEN OFF.  THIS INCLUDED THE STUDS WHICH THE TIRE SITS UPON AND IS FASTENED THROUGH. AFTER TOWING THE VEHICLE TO A TOW YARD UTILIZING MY AAA ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE, I PHONED THE DEALERSHIP AND INFORMED THEM OF WHAT HAD OCCURRED.  I INFORMED THEM THAT VEHICLE WAS HAZARDOUS AND ALMOST KILLED ME.  I WAS TOLD NOT TO WORRY ABOUT IT AND THEY WOULD PHONE THE TOW YARD AND RETRIEVE THE VEHICLE THAT DAY.  THE CAR REMAINS AT THE SAME TOW YARD TO THIS DATE, AND ON SATURDAY, 1/3/09, I PHONED THE DEALERSHIP AND SPOKE TO THE REPAIR GUY, HE THEN INFORMED MYSELF THEY WERE NOT WILLING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. *TR",
