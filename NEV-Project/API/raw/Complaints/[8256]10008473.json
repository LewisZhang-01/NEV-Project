I HAVE SPENT NEARLY $600 ON THIS PART IN THE LAST 9 MONTHS AND I AM STILL PAYING FOR MY CAR. AN IGNITION SHOULD USUALLY OUT LAST THE LIFE OF THE CAR. I AM VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THE SERVICE I AM RECEIVING FROM FORD AND I KNOW THIS WILL BE A RE-OCCURRING PROBLEM. THEY ALSO HAD TO SHAVE MY KEY A LITTLE TO MAKE IT WORK BUT IT DOES NOT FEEL THE WAY IT USED TO AND IT REALLY BOTHERS ME BECAUSE I KNOW IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.   *JB",
