I HAVE BEEN PULLED OVER BY A STATE TROOPER TRAVELING IN FRONT OF ME, AS HE THOUGHT I WAS SIGNALING HIM THAT I WAS IN TROUBLE. I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE DOWN CERTAIN ROADS AT NIGHT DUE TO THE FACT SOMEONE IN FRONT OF ME WILL THINK I AM FLASHING THEM TO PULL OVER OR GET OUT OF MY WAY AND PULL OVER IN A CASE OF \"ROAD RAGE\" AND HURT ME. I WORK 3-11 AS A NURSE AND DO TRAVEL 50 MILES HOME AT NIGHT DOWN DARK DESERTED HWYS AND I AM IN FEAR THAT THE LIGHTS WILL GO OUT TOTALLY. SATURN HAS TOLD ME THIS IS \"NORMAL\" OPERATION FOR THIS VEHICLE. I FEEL IT IS A THREAT TO MY SAFETY AND THAT OF OTHERS.   *JB",
