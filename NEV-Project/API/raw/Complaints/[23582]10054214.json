THE INDICATOR LIGHT WILL FLASH WHEN THERE IS A FULL TANK, AND THE DISPLAY FOR FULL OR EMPTY CHANGES AT ITS WHIM.  THIS IS A COVERED REPAIR FOR 1998 AND 2000, BUT NOT FOR 1999.  WHY IS ISUZU NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ISSUE?  IT IS CLEARLY NOT SAFE TO DRIVE ON THE FREEWAY IF YOU CAN'T TELL HOW MUCH FUEL IS IN THE TANK.  *CB",
