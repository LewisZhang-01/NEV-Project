IT DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I HAVE HAD THE PROBLEM SEVERAL TIMES SINCE, USUALLY IN MONMOUTH COUNTY, MOST TIMES NEAR MY HOME, BUT LAST TIME IN LONG ISLAND FREEWAY. THE BRAKES DO NOT SLOW DOWN/STOP VEHICLE FOR APPROXIMATELY 1 SECOND, AND THEN START TO WORK. IT IS INTERMITTENT PROBLEM. I HAD LEXUS REP COME TO TEST MY CAR YESTERDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 2010. THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO SIMULATE PROBLEM, BUT HAVE ADVISED THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SIMULATE PROBLEM ON OTHER VEHICLES OF THIS MODEL SINCE THE RECALL REPAIR. THEY ADVISED THAT EVEN IF THEY SIMULATE THE NON-BRAKING, THIS IS CONSIDERED \"NORMAL\" BASED ON THE LEXUS ENGINEERS. I WANT A CAR THAT BRAKES EVERY TIME. IT IS NOT SAFE VEHICLE.",
