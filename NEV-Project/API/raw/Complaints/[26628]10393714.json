THIS HAS HAPPENED WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY WITH MY 5 KIDS IN THE VAN WITH ME. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS, AND SCARY FOR YOUR VAN TO SUDDENLY DISENGAGE AT 65 MILES PER HOUR. WE HAD A SOLENOID REPLACED BUT ARE NOW BEING TOLD THAT WE NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION ON A VAN WITH ONLY 84,000 MILES. HONDA HAS NOT BEEN VERY HELPFUL AT ALL. I AM SCARED TO DRIVE THE VAN.  *TR",
