THE DRIVERS SEAT BELT WAS REPLACED 1 TIME WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY. NOW THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY THE SEAT BELTS WILL NOT RETRACT. THIS IS AN OBVIOUS FAULT WITH THE BELTS. I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD BE OUT THE EXPENSE OR BEAR THE DANGER OF FAULTY SEAT BELTS. WHEN THE SEAT BELT IS PULLED OUT IT SIMPLY DANGLES JUST LIKE THE FIRST TIME WHEN IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY.*JB",
