BRAKE PEDAL WAS HARD TO DEPRESS AS IF THE IGNITION WAS TURNED OFF. NOT THE CASE ENGINE WAS RUNNING AND BRAKES WERE APPLIED WITH EXTREME PRESSURE AND FINALLY WAS ABLE TO STOP VEHICLE BEFORE I BOUNCED OFF OF CURB. I UNDERSTAND CHEVROLET IS AWARE OF THIS AND THERE IS SOME CLASS ACTION LAW SUITS OUT THERE. A TSB HAS BEEN ISSUED BUT, FROM ALL THE FORUMS I HAVE READ THIS DOES NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM. I WILL TAKE INTO DEALERSHIP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IF IT DON'T KILL ME FIRST. HELP",
