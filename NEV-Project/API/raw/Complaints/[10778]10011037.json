I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND THEY TOLD ME THAT I HAD OIL SLUDGE/GEL AND THAT I HAD BLOWN A ROD.  THEY THEN TOLD ME ABOUT TOYOTA PAYING TO REPLACE THE ENGINE DUE TO THIS PROBLEM, BUT I THEN FOUND OUT MY CAR WAS NOT INCLUDED THAT IT STARTED WITH THE 1997 MODEL.  I THEN REQUESTED THAT THEY(TOYOTA) REVIEW THIS FURTHER AND THEY ASKED THAT I SUBMIT MY OIL CHANGE LOG AND DEALER DIAGNOSIS.  AFTER THEY REVIEWED IT FURTHER THEY SAID IT WAS A LACK OF MAINTENANCE ON MY PART AND THERE WAS NOTHING FURTHER THAT THEY WOULD DO.  I HAVE REALLY TAKEN CARE OF MY CAR AND AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER.  THE CAR HAS BEEN GREAT UP TIL NOW.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE IS ANYTHING FURTHER THAT I SHOULD DO.",
