I TOOK IT INTO THE SHOP, AND THEIR SAID THE CLOCK SPRING NEEDS REPLACED. IT WASN'T UNTIL AFTER ALL OF THIS THAT I FOUND OUT THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL. I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED OF THIS RECALL BEFORE. ALTHOUGH THE CLOCK SPRING NEEDS REPLACED, THE VW SERVICE CENTER SAID THEY CANNOT GET THE CLOCK SPRING PART TO REPLACE IT. THEY COULDN'T TELL ME A TIME THAT THE PART WOULD BE AVAILABLE.",
