THOROUGHLY CLEANED VEHICLE BUT STILL SMELT GASOLINE VAPORS INSIDE OF THE CAB FOR 30 MINUTES WITH THE WINDOW DOWN. DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND IT IS DUE TO THE VEHICLE'S ICV BECOMING STUCK IN THE OPEN POSITION, WHICH BUILDS PRESSURE INSIDE OF THE GAS TANK, ALLOWING THE FILLER NECK TO FILL WITH GASOLINE, AND THEN RELEASES THE PRESSURE WHICH PROPELLS THE GASOLINE OUT OF THE FILLER NECK AND ONTO THE GROUND. IN ORDER TO FIX THIS PROBLEM I MUST REPLACE THE ENTIRE GAS TANK.  *TR",
