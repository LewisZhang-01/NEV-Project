THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AS MY WINDSHIELD FOGS UP WHILE I AM DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND I HAVE NO WAY OF DEFOGGING MY WINDSHIELD. I FEEL THIS VEHICLE IS NO LONGER SAFE TO TAKE MY FAMILY ON EXTENDED TRIPS. I FEEL STRONGLY THIS IS A SAFETY DEFECT (POORLY DESIGNED OR IMPROPER FACTORY INSTALLATION OF THE \"BLEND DOOR\"), BUT FORD REFUSES TO FIX THIS PROBLEM SINCE MY CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY. FORD WANTS $1200.00 TO FIX THIS DEFECT WHICH I CAN NOT AFFORD. FORD HAS A REDESIGNED PART, BUT WILL NOT ADMIT TO THIS SAFETY PROBLEM.    *NLM",
