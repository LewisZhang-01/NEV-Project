TOO IT IN AND THEY TOLD ME THAT I NEED AN ENTIRE NEW TRANSMISSION OR THEY COULD REPAIR IT FOR $100.00 LESS THEN A FACTORY REBUILT TRANSMISSION.  I DON'T FEEL AS THOUGH A TRANSMISSION SHOULD BE SLIPPING WITH ONLY 47,000 MILES ON IT.  THE SERVICE MAN TOLD ME THAT IT WAS THE FRONT CLUTCH PISTON WAS WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM.  HAVE YOU HAD ANY OTHER COMPLAINTS?  I FEEL AS THOUGH THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE DUE TO THE LOW MILES.  I FEEL AS THOUGH IT IS A FACTORY DEFECT.",
