        "summary": "I OWN A 2004 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE WITH ONLY 16000 MILES. AT 12600 MILE I HAD BRAKE PROBLEMS WHERE THE JEEP WHO SHAKE VIOLENTLY WHEN THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED TO THE POINT WHERE SOMEONE MIGHT LOOSE CONTROL OF THE JEEP CAUSING A SERIOUS ACCIDENT RESULTING IN A POSSIBLE DEATH. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THE ROTORS NEEDED TO BE REPLACE AND THE WARRANTY EXPIRED AFTER 12000 MILES SO I WOULD HAVE TO PAY $400 WHICH I REFUSED TO DO. I TOOK THE CAR TO MY PERSONNEL MECHANIC AND HAD THE ROTORS TURNED AND NEW PADS FOR AROUND $100. NOW WITH 16000 IT NEEDS TO BE DONE AGAIN. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. ITS NOT RIGHT THAT EVERY 3-5000 MILES I NEED BRAKES! I WAS TOLD THAT ITS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE ROTORS THROUGH DESIGN TOE IN WHEN APPLIED CAUSING EXCESSIVE WEAR ON THE PADS AND ROTORS. THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW AND NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED! I WILL FILE WITH THE BBB HERE IN MA. AND THE ATT. GEN BUT I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN ASSIST ALSO. IF YOU LOOK AT WEBSITES LIKE WWW.MYCARSTATS.COM THERE ARE AT LEAST A 100 COMPLAINTS REFERENCING THE SAME ISSUE. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE...BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT.  *JB",
