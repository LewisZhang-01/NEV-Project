I WAS FURTHER TOLD THAT THE PART WAS OBSOLETE AND UNAVAILABLE.  I CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY DIRECTLY ON SEVEN SEPARATE OCCASIONS...EACH TIME THEY EMAILED ME A DIFFERENT \"OBSOLETE PARTS VENDOR TO CONTACT...EACH TIME TO NO AVAIL.  ON 6/5, IN THEIR FINAL RESPONSE TO ME, FORD INDICATED THAT THEY FELT THEY HAD RESPONDED APPROPRIATELY AND WOULD DO NOTHING ELSE TO HELP.  IN THE MEANTIME, THE ABS ON MY CAR STILL DOES NOT WORK AND I AM NO CLOSER TO A RESOLUTION.  THIS IS A SAFETY RELATED ISSUE THAT I FEEL FORD NEEDS TO ADDRESS. *TR",
