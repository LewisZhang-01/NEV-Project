WENT TO MECHANICS AT PONTIAC AND MARTIN MAZDA (WHEN THEY TOOK OVER) AND ALL THEY DID WAS UNPLUG THE BATTERY AND PUT IT BACK IN AGAIN.   THE CHECK LIGHT COME BACK ON A DAY OR TWO LATER.  THEY NEVER FIX THE PROBLEM.  MY FEELING IS THERE WAS A CONSPIRACY BY MARTIN MAZDA AND NUCAR PONTIAC TO DELAY ACTUALLY FIXING THE PROBLEM.  BEING THAT MY CAR WAS REGISTERED FOR THREE YEARS, THE STATE OF DELAWARE WOULDN'T CATCH IT ON THE INSPECTION REPORT.  I WENT FOR INSPECTION AND IT FAILED BECAUSE THE \"CHECK LIGHT\" WAS ON AND IT PRODUCED CERTAIN CODES.",
