DEALER CLAIMS THE BRAKE IS WORKING PROPERLY AS DESIGNED, TAKEN TO DEALER AT LEAST 3 TIMES OVER THE PAST 3 YEARS FOR THIS COMPLAINT, ALWAYS WITH THE SAME EXPLANATION.  LAST TIME I HAD THIS CHECKED RECENTLY I WAS TOLD THE PARKING BRAKE SHOES NEEDED REPLACEMENT, THAT I HAD BEEN DRIVING WITH THE PARKING BRAKE ON (UNTRUE).  I HAD BRAKES EXAMINED AT A NON GMC SHOP AND WAS TOLD THE BRAKES WERE OVERLY WORN ON ONE SIDE DUE TO IMPROPER ADJUSTMENT.  I HAVE NEVER HAD A FUNCTIONING PARKING BRAKE IN THIS VEHICLE.  THE DEALER GAVE ME MISINFORMATION ON AT LEAST 3 OCCASIONS, NOW REFUSING TO REPAIR THAT THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED.   THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE WHICH SHOULD BE EXAMINED BY NSTA.  THANK YOU.",
