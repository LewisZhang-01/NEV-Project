IF I CYCLE THE HEADLIGHTS OFF AND BACK ON, THE PASSENGER SIDE HEADLIGHT WILL COME BACK ON FOR A WHILE, AND THEN REPEAT.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, DRIVING WITH ONE (OR NO) HEADLIGHT.  MY CAR HAS ABOUT 65,000 MILES, THOUGH IT IS ONLY 2 AND A HALF YEARS OLD.  THIS APPEARS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 2007 AND 2006 PRIUS MODELS WITH THE HID HEADLIGHTS. *TR",
