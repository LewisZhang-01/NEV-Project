        "summary": "I HAVE A 2000 TUNDRA ACCESS CAB TRUCK WITH 62,000 MILES. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON SO I HAD IT DIAGNOSED. THE FRONT O2 SENSOR BEFORE THE CAT HAS FAILED. I WROTE TOYOTA AND THEY SAID THAT THEY HAD EXTENDED THE WARRANTY TO 7 YRS OR 90,000 MILES. THEY SAID THAT IT WAS ALSO UP TO THE LOCAL DEALER TO DECIDE IF THE FAULT WOULD BE COVERED. I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE FROM A RELATIVE, WHO IS NOW DECEASED, AND DID NOT RECEIVE ANY RECALL INFO. I WROTE TO TOYOTA AND THEY TOLD ME TO TALK TO MY LOCAL DEALERSHP. I TALKED TO THE LOCAL DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME TO WRITE OR CALL THE TOYOTA EXPERIENCE DEPARTMENT, OR WHAT EVER IT IS. FROM WHAT I HAVE READ THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE GETTING RIPPED OFF FOR A DEFECT IN FACTORY PROVIDED PARTS AND REPLACEMENT PARTS. I DEFINATELY THINK THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW AND SHOULD BE COVERED BY TOYOTA. I FOR ONE CAN NOT AFFORD TO OWN A VEHICLE THAT IS GOING TO COST $200.00 TO $800.00 EVERY 6 MONTHS TO 2 YEARS. THIS ALSO AFFECTS THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE FACT THAT THIS VEHICLE HAS TO BE SMOGGED EVERY 2 YEARS.",
