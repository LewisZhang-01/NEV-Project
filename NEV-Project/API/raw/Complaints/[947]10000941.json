HOWEVER, I'VE PRODUCED MAINTENANCE RECORDS FOR FORD AND THE DEALERSHIP WHICH CLEARLY SHOW WE'VE FOLLOWED FORD'S MAINTENANCE RECOMMENDATIONS; INCLUDED HAVING THE TRANSMISSION SERVICED BY THE DEALERSHIP (AT 42,000). THIS SEEMS TO BE ONE EXAMPLE IN A LONG LINE OF FORD TRANSMISSION FAILURE.  WHEN WILL THE NHTSA, OR ANOTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY, FINALLY STEP IN AND CONFRONT FORD? TS",
