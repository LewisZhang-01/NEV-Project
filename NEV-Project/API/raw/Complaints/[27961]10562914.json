THE CONCERN IS IF THE AIRBAG EVER HAS TO DEPLOY, THE AIRBAG WILL EITHER TEAR RENDERING THE AIRBAG USELESS, OR THE DASHBOARD WILL SHATTER SENDING PLASTIC PIECES THROUGHOUT THE FRONT AND BACK SEATS AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. I'VE DONE ENOUGH RESEARCH TO KNOW THIS IS A WIDE SPREAD PROBLEM, YET GM IS ONLY OFFERING TO PAY FOR HALF OF THIS EXPENSIVE REPLACEMENT.   IN THE MEAN TIME I HAVE PARKED THIS VEHICLE AND WILL NOT ALLOW MY WIFE TO DRIVE THIS WITH OUR TWO CHILDREN.  *TR",
