THE SENDING UNIT IS NECESSARY FOR CORRECT GAUGE READINGS. THIS HAS HAPPENED AT THE WORST TIME FOR ME AS A SINGLE MOTHER SUFFERING FROM JOB LOSSES IN THE STATE OF GOERGIA. THE ESTIMATES TO REPAIR THE FUEL SYSTEM HAS AVERAGED 700.00 DOLLARS    I AM ALSO FILING A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION THAT SLIPS TOO. THE TRANSMISSION WILL NOT GO INTO 2ND OR 3RD GEAR WITH OUT A LOT OF EXTRA EFFORT. THERE ARE TIMES I HAVE TO TAKE BACK ROADS AND ACCESS ROADS JUST BECAUSE I WAS NEARLY HIT SEVERAL TIMES TRYING TO ACCESS THE EXPRESS WAY. SUV'S ARE HORRENDOUS IN GAS MILEAGE BUT A SUV WITH A SLIPPING TRANSMISSION IS BURNING EVEN MORE GAS! I AM STILL TRYING TO PAY FOR THE CAR AND CAN NOT AFFORD THE REPAIRS. I WISH I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT AN IMPORT. I HAVE MET QUITE A FEW JEEP OWNERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEMS.*JB",
