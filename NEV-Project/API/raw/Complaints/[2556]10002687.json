I WAS TRAVELLING AROUND 60-65 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN THIS HAPPENED, LOSING COMPLETE POWER AND ALMOST GETTING HIT. MY CAR HAD TO GET TOWED 40 MILES TO THE DEALERSHIP, WHICH IN TURN TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD ONLY REPLACE THE ONE COIL PACK NOT ALL THREE, KNOWING THAT THE OTHER 3 WILL EVENTUALLY FAIL AND CAUSE SOME TROUBLE AGAIN. THIS IS RIDICULOUS MY WIFE OWNS A 2003 VW JETTA , WHAT IF, HEAVEN FORBID, ONE OF US WERE TO GET INTO AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF THIS WHEN IT COULD HAVE BEEN FIXED IN THE FIRST PLACE. I'M THOROUGHLY DISGUSTED WITH THIS.",
