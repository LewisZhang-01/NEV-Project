THE CAR DID NOT COME TO A DEAD STOP BUT ALMOST FELT LIKE IT WAS LOCKING UP AND WAS BARELY MOVING.  FORTUNATELY, I WAS ABLE TO PULL INTO A PARKING LOT AND TURNED THE CAR OFF AND RESTARTED IT.  I HAD THE STALLING ISSUE HAPPEN LAST APRIL OR MAY 2002.  THEY DID SOME \"FIXES\" AND RESET THE COMPUTER.  I HAD READ RECENTLY READ, THEY FELT THAT RESETTING THE COMPUTER WOULD RESOLVE THE ISSUE BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT IT HAS NOT.  I HAVE TWO SMALL CHILDREN AND NOW, LIKE MANY OTHER ESCAPE DRIVERS, AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE CAR.   *JB",
