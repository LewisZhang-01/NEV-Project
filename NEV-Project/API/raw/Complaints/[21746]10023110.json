        "summary": "THE FRONT SEATS HAVE NO SPRING SUSPENSION. YOU ARE BASICALLY SITTING IN A PAN OF FOAM. THE PAN THAT THE SEAT CUSHION SITS IN COMES UP UNDER THE SEAT SIDE BOLSTERS. AS THE FOAM LOOSES IT'S DENSITY AND SUPPORT YOU EVENTUALLY END UP SITTING ON THE EDGE OF THIS PAN. THIS CAUSES CIRCULATION, AND NERVE PROBLEMS IN THE THIGHS. I DRIVE ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES A WEEK . I PURCHASED A NEW LOWER SEAT CUSHION FROM NISSAN OF BRANDON. THE NEW CUSHION ASSEMBLY'S FOAM WAS NOT AS DENSE AS THE ORIGINAL. AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR IN THE SEAT BOTH LEGS BEGAN TO BOTHER ME,NOT JUST THE RIGHT LEG AS WITH THE ORIGINAL CUSHION. THE ORIGINAL CUSHION WAS APPROXIMATELY FOUR AND A HALF YEARS OLD, AND THE TRUCK HAD ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE THOUSAND MILES ON IT. I RETURNED THE CUSHION AND WAS CHARGED A TEN PERCENT HANDLING FEE SINCE THE CUSHION HAD BEEN SPECIAL ORDERED. I HAVE HAD THE OLD SEAT STUFFED WITH FOAM A VARIETY OF WAYS TO NO AVAIL,IT STILL BOTHERS ME GREATLY. DO I NOW HAVE NERVE DAMAGE TO MY LEGS ? I DON'T KNOW. THEY BOTHER ME A LOT. NOW WHAT IS MY RECOURSE. I CAN'T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GET A PROPER REPLACEMENT FROM THE MANUFACTURER. I ONLY HAVE FOUR PAYMENTS LEFT ON THE TRUCK AND IT IS KILLING ME. PLEASE TELL ME WHAT I AM SUPPOSED TO DO?    *NLM",
