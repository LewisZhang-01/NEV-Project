I BELIEVE THIS LEAVES THE CAR OCCUPANTS IN A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. THE LEXUS DEALER WANTS AN ABSURD AMOUNT OF MONEY ($1500) TO FIX PROBLEM, WHICH I BELIEVE IS A FACTORY DESIGN FLAW AND NEEDS TO BE RECALLED.  JUST OVER RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM IN 1 DAY I HAVE FOUND ALMOST 50 PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM FROM THE SAME CAR.*JB",
