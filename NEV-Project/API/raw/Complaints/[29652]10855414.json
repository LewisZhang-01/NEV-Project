I LAST CHECKED THE SPARE TIRE IN NOV 2015 AND NOTICED IT GONE IN APRIL 2016.    ALL THAT REMAINS IS A SPLINTERED CABLE.  IN TALKING TO PEOPLE IN THE AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS THEY TELL ME THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE.   IN MY CASE IF IT DID INDEED FALL OUT WHILE DRIVING I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT NO ONE GOT HURT.   I DO NOT KNOW IF NEWER VEHICLES ARE STILL EQUIPPED WITH THESE CABLES.   I THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME SORT OF SECONDARY  SYSTEM TO PREVENT THE TIRE FROM FALLING OUT SHOULD THE CABLE SNAP AS I HAVE NOW COME TO UNDERSTAND TO BE A FAIRLY FREQUENT OCCURRENCE.",
