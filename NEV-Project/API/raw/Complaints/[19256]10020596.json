SEAT SLIDES FORWARD AND BACKWARD FREELY.  I FEEL THIS IS A SEVERE SAFETY CONCERN DUE TO THE FACT THAT YOU CANNOT CONTROL THE VEHICLE WHEN YOU ARE UNABLE TO STOP THE SEAT FROM FLYING YOU FORWARD.  THE LOCKING MECHANISM SHOULD NEVER BREAK.  THE CHEVROLET DEALER CALLS THIS A SEAT ADJUSTER, BUT IS A PIECE OF PLASTIC THAT HAS THE LOCKING PIN IN IT.  A PIECE OF PLASTIC TO HOLD A SEAT IN ITS PLACE IS TOTALLY STUPID.     *TT",
