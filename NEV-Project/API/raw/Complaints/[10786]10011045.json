THIS IS VERY SCARY AND I HAVE BEEN LUCKY SINCE IT HAPPENED ONCE ON THE INTERSTATE IN 4 FOUR LANES OF TRAFFIC.  I HAVE TRIED TO CONTACT FORD ABOUT IT TO SEE IF THEY HAD A RECALL OR SERVICE BULLETIN AND THEY LEFT A VOICE MAIL WITH NO TELEPHONE NUMBER.  NOW THEY HAVE UNANSWERED 3 ADDITIONAL EMAILS.  I CONTACTED THE LOCAL DEALER AND HE SAYS HE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ESCAPE STALLING EVEN THOUGH IT IS ALL OVER THE INTERNET WHERE THEY SAY THE DEALERS CAN NOT FIX IT.  MY DEALER IS JUST MAKING GUESSES.  THIS IS WHY I WANTED AT LEAST A SERVICE BULLETIN SO I DO NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH A GUESSING GAME WITH MY DEALER.  I AM VERY SCARED OF MY ESCAPE NOW ESPECIALLY IN INTERSTATE TRAFFIC.   *JB",
