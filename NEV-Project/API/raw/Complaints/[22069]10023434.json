MANY OWNERS ARE HAVING TO DO AFTER MARKET MODIFICATIONS TO BRING FUNCTIONALITY TO AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL. SUZUKI MUST HAVE KNOWN THIS AS THEY THOROUGHLY REDESIGNED THE SYSTEM FROM YEAR MODEL 2002 TO PRESENT. I HAVE COME CLOSE TO HAVING SEVERAL ACCIDENTS DUE TO BRAKE FADE DURING A HARD PANIC STOP.   *NLM",
