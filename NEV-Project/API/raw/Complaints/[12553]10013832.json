THIS VEHICLE'S OIL AND FILTER WAS CHANGED EVERY 3000 MILES YET WHEN THE ENGINE WAS DISASSEMBLED THERE WAS LARGE AMOUNTS OF SLUDGE THROUGH OUT THE IT'S INSIDE ,AND I WAS TOLD THE ENGINE NEEDED TO BE REBUILT BUT THIS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE THING TO DO WHICH THE DEALER TOLD ME WOULD COST ABOUT $4000.00 THIS WAS THE CHEAPEST FIX. WHICH I DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO REPAIR RIGHT NOW SO NOW I AM PAY FOR A CAR I CAN NOT DRIVE.  AND FROM ALL THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE READ THERE SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH A GREAT MANY OF THE 2.7 LITER V6 ENGINES INSTALLED IN THIS VEHICLE. THE REPAIRS ARE VERY COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING.  *NLM",
