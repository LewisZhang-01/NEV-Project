THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALERSHIP SEVERAL TIMES, SAID NO PROBLEM WAS FOUND. WE REALIZED SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE, TOOK THE CAR TO OTHER PROFESSIONALS, AND NOTIFIED THE MANUFACTURER.  MANUFACTURER REQUESTED INSPECTION BY THE ORIGINAL DEALERSHIP (?0 NOTHING FOUND WRONG. WE REQUESTED ANOTHER INSPECTION WHICH WAS DONE BY ANOTHER DEALERSHIP. FOUND THE SUB-FRAME WAS DEFECTIVE FROM THE FACTORY. SAID THIS WOULD CAUSE THE STEERING TO BE OFF. MY CONCERNS IS THAT A DEFECTED SUB-FRAME MAY BE THE CAUSE OF THE MANY COMPLAINTS BY THE CONSUMERS FOR THIS CAR. A DECISION HAS NOT BEEN MADE BY THE MANUFACTURER AS TO HOW TO HANDLE THIS AS OF 7/18/02.   *JB      ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*****764384",
