        "summary": "I OWN A 1993 GRAND PRIX. EVER SINCE I BOUGHT IT USED IN 2001, I HAVE HAD TO PULL THE TURNING SIGNAL MECHANISM FORWARD TO MAKE THEM OPERABLE. ABOUT A MONTH AGO, MY 19-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER WAS BORROWING THE CAR. WHEN SHE USED THE TURNING SIGNAL IT STARTED TO SMOKE. THE WHOLE STEERING COLUMN CAUGHT FIRE AND FLAMES SHOT UP THROUGH THE VENTS IN THE CAR. FORTUNATELY, SHE WAS CLOSE TO HOME SO WE COULD EXTINGUISH IT WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED TO DISCONNECT THE BATTERY.   I HAVE SINCE HEARD OF VARIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THIS MODEL. I FRIEND REPORTED THAT HER 1993 GRAND PRIX\u0019S TURNING SIGNALS WERE SMOKING BEFORE SHE TRADED IT IN.   I HAVE CONTACTED GM\u0019S LITIGATION DEPARTMENT. THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN INVESTIGATING THE PROBLEM ANY FURTHER. THEY TOLD ME BECAUSE OF THE HIGH MILES AND BECAUSE I WAS THE SECOND OWNER OF THE CAR THEY CANNOT MAKE A DETERMINATION. I HAVE ONLY LOST A CAR, WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE, IT IS MY HOPE IN CONTACTING THIS OFFICE THAT A LIFE WILL NOT BE LOST DUE TO WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE A SAFETY DEFECT IN GM\u0019 S PRODUCT.",
