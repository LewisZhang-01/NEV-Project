IF RUN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO, SHUT OFF, AND RESTARTED, THE PROBLEM GOES AWAY(?). AFTER THREE CONTACTS WITH THE DEALERS (TWO OF THEM) THEY HAVE FINALLY SAID THEY ARE AWARE OF A PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL AND IT CAN BE EASILY FIXED. CONSIDERING THE POTENTIAL FOR FIRE OR EVEN AN EXPLOSION, I WOULD THINK THEY WOULD WANT TO ADVISE CUSTOMERS OF THIS PROBLEM. ALSO, THEIR DEALERS. *JB",
