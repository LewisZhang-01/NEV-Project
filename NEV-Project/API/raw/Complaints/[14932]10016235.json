HAVE TOWED CAR SEVERAL TIMES TO DEALER BUT ONCE THERE, THE CAR STARTS AND THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG SO I HAVE TO PAY THE TOWING. LAST TRIP TO DEALER (ABOUT A WEEK AGO, THEY DID FIND SOMETHING WRONG AND OF COURSE WHAT THEY FOUND WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY) NOW IT HAPPENED AGAIN....THIS TIME WE GOT STRANDED OUT OF TOWN. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THE FORD FOCUS. I BOUGHT THIS CAR SO MY SON WOULD HAVE RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION BUT HAS BECOME MORE OF A PROBLEM THAN NOT HAVING A CAR AT ALL.  NEED HELP TO RESOLVE. *JB",
