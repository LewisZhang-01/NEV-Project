WAS TOLD BY A DEALER \"DICK HANNAH\" IN WASHINGTON, CHRYSLER WOULD NOT PAY FOR ANY PROBLEMS THOUGH CHRYSLER HAS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST THEM.  I FOUND A LOCAL COMPANY TO FIX THE PROBLEM FOR ABOUT $200 LESS THAN THE DEALER.  I AM STILL VERY PISSED-OFF ABOUT THE CUSTOMER SERVICE OF CHRYSLER.  WITH THIS MANY COMPLAINTS WHY ARE THEY SO UNWILLING TO PAY FOR, WHAT SOUNDS TO ME, LIKE AN ENGINEERING MISTAKE IN THE DESIGN OF THE BRAKES.  I WILL NEVER BUY A CHRYSLER PRODUCT AGAIN.   *JB",
