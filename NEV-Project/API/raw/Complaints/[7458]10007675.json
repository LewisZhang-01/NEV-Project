        "summary": "ON 7/19/02, I WAS IN AN ACCIDENT AND TOTALED MY VEHICLE. SINCE THEN, I HAVE BEEN DRIVING MY 1997 PONTIAC GRAND PRIX THAT I PURCHASED FROM MY GRANDPARENTS. LESS THAN A MONTH LATER, 2ND AND THRIRD GEAR MELTED TOGETHER IN THE TRANSMISSION. THE ABS LIGHT HAS COME ON, AND THE CAR HAS LOST TRACTION. SINCE THAT DATE, MY FRONT SEAL STARTED LEAKING, I HAVE REPLACED MY BRAKES WHICH ARE QUICKLY WEARING OUT, I HAVE BEEN THROUGH 3 SETS OF TIRES, AND REPLACED THE FRONT BEARING ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE. I HAVE ALSO HAD TO HAVE A FRONT END ALIGNMENT DOE AND AM AGAIN IN DESPERATE NEED OF ANOTHER ONE. DUE TO THIS BEING MY ONLY VEHICLE, MY OPTIONS ARE LIMITED. I OFTEN FEEL SHAKING IN THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE CAR TENDS TO PULL. IT HAS BEEN LESS THAN A MONTH SINCE WE REPLACED THE BEARING AND WE ALREADY HEAR THE SAME RUBBING NOISE WE HEARD BEFORE. FINANCES LIMIT WHAT REPAIRS I CAN AND CAN'T HAVE ON THIS CAR. I HAVE ALREADY SPENT ABOUT $3500.00 ON THIS CAR, PLUS THE $5000 I BOUGHT IT FOR. WHEN YOU BRING HOME $1200.00 A MONTH, HAVE A HOUSE PAYMENT, TWO CAR PAYMENTS, AND ONLY ONE VEHICLE RUNNING(NOT A SAFE OR RELIABLE ONE AT THAT) IT MAKES MATTERS WORSE. MY MAIN REASON FOR WRITING THIS LETTER IS BECAUSE I HAVE LOST CONTROL OF MY CAR TWICE, WITH NO EXPLANATION. I AM SCARED TO DRIVE TO WORK, BUT I CAN NOT AFFORD ANOTHER VEHICLE OR PAY SOMEONE ELSE TO DRIVE ME 80 MILES ROUND TRIP TO GET TO WORK. ANY ASSISTANCE ANYONE CAN PROVIDE WOULD BE APPRECIATED.",
