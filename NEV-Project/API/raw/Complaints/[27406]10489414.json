TOWING A TRAILER, I HAD TO BRAKE HARD TO AVOID REAR ENDING. THE BRAKES INITIALLY WORKED NORMALLY, AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STOP SAFELY. THEN THE PEDAL SUNK TO THE FIREWALL AND WARNING LIGHTS & MESSAGES APPEARED. I SOUNDED THE HORN AND THE CAR IN FRONT MOVED TO GIVE ME SPACE TO COMPLETE THE STOP UNDER MANUAL BRAKING, WHICH IS PRONE TO SKIDDING WITHOUT MODULATION OR TRACTION CONTROL.    ONCE GETTING THE TRUCK TO A SHOP, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEFT REAR BRAKE LINE HAD BURST, AND THAT ALL THE LINES SUFFERED HEAVY CORROSION. I'VE READ THERE HAS BEEN INVESTIGATION OF BRAKE LINE CORROSION ON GM TRUCKS, IT SEEMS MINE IS AFFECTED.  *TR",
