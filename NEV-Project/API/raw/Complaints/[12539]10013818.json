        "summary": "AFTER THE VEHICLE WARMED UP THE OIL PRESSURE GAUGE WOULD READ ALMOST 0.  STARTED READING OK UNTIL IT WARMED UP.  TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND THE ONLY THING THEY COULD FIGURE OUT WAS THAT THE OIL PUMP HAD GONE BAD. THEIR PRICE QUOTE WAS UNREAL (+ OR - $3,200).   WE TOOK IT TO A LOCAL MECHANIC AND THEY ESTIMATED $1,200.00. HAD TO DROP THE TRANSMISSION THEY SAID TO GET TO THE OIL PUMP.  THIS YEAR (2003)  THE GAUGE IS ACTING UP AGAIN. IT STARTS OUT FINE AND AFTER IT WARMS UP, IT DROPS TO ABOUT 10 ON THE PRESSURE GAUGE. WHEN YOU ACCELERATE THE PRESSURE GOES UP TO MAYBE 20 OR SO ON THE GAUGE.    I AM NOT EXACTLY SURE ON THE EXACT PURCHASE AND INCIDENT DATE. BUT THEY ARE APPROXIMATE.  I HAVE FOUND NUMEROUS ARTICLES ON THE INTERNET RELATING TO GMC AND THE FAULTY OIL PRESSURE GAUGE/READINGS. I COULD NOT FIND ANY SPECIFIC RESEARCH THAT POINTED TO THE EXACT PROBLEM. WHETHER IT WAS THE GAUGE, THE ENGINE OR ETC. I TALKED WITH FRIENDS AND RELATIVES THAT OWN THE JIMMY OR BLAZER AND THEIRS WAS ACTING THE SAME WAY.  *NLM",
