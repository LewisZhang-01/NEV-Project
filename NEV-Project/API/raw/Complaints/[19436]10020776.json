IT ONLY BEGINS TO FADE AFTER A FEW MILES.  IT OCCURS EVERY TIME I DRIVE.  I NOTIFIED TOYOTA WHO REFERRED ME TO THE DEALERSHIP.  KOONS SAID IT'S A KNOWN ISSUE, BUT NOTHING CAN BE DONE.  SOMETHING TO DO WITH EMISSIONS.  I DROVE A 2003 HIGHLANDER AND DID NOT EXPERIENCE THIS.  ALSO, AN AWFUL DRAFT COMES THROUGH THE DRIVER'S SIDE CONTROL (POWER WINDOWS/LOCKS) PANEL.  I'VE ALSO NOTICED A SUDDEN SURGE WHEN STOPPED AT A LIGHT.  THANKS",
