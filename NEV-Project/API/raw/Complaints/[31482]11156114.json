        "summary": "AIR BAG INDICATOR ON DASHBOARD CAME ON SUDDENLY ONE MORNING AT MILEAGE OF 86,500 AND WOULD NOT GO OFF EVEN AFTER RE-STARTING. WE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO OUR LOCAL DEALERSHIP WERE WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE, TO BE DIAGNOSED. THE DEALERSHIP DETERMINED IT WAS A FAULTY OCS FOR THE OCCUPANT SIDE AIRBAG AND THAT IT WOULD NOT BE COVER EVEN THOUGH WE HAD A GOLD 120,000 EXTENDED WARRANTY WITH NO-DEDUCTIBLES. THIS IS ONE OF HE EXCLUDED PARTS NOT COVERED UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. I REACHED OUT TO NISSAN  CONSUMER AFFAIRS ON 11-30-18 AFTER DISCUSSING WITH THE DEALERSHIP AND SPOKE WITH A HELEN EMPLOYEE #7319348 AND WAS ASSIGNED CASE# 33678608 AND WAS TOLD SOMEONE WOULD GET BACK TO ME BY THE END OF THE DAY 12-3-18. ON 12-3-18 BRANDAN FRO NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS CALLED BACK, BUT I MISSED HIS CALL. I RETURNED HIS CALL AND LEFT MESSAGES FOR HIM TO CALL ME BACK ON 2 MORE OCCASIONS BUT DID NOT HEAR BACK FROM HIM. ON THE MORNING OF 12-5-18 I CALLED HIM AGAIN AND WAS ABLE TO SPEAK WITH HIM. BRANDAN  EMPLOYEE # 33678608 TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE COVERING THE PART OR LABOR INVOLVED (APPROX COST ACCORDING TO DEALERSHIP OF $450 FOR PARTS AND LABOR). I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE HAD A TOTAL OF 8 RECALLS DOCUMENTED UNDER THE NHTSA OF WHICH 3 OF DEALT WITH THE OCCUPANT SIDE AIRBAG AND OCS (#16V911000, #16V24400 AND #15V681000) AND THAT IT WAS A SAFTY ISSUE AND WAS NO FAULT OF OURS AND BASED UPON ALL THIS INFORMATION THE CORRECT THING TO DO WOULD BE TO COVER THIS ISSUE. HE APOLOGIZED OVER-AND-OVER BUT WOULD NOT COMMIT TO COVER THIS.  IT IS OF MY OPINION AND THE OPINION OF THE DEALERSHIP THAT THIS ISSUE IS MOST LIKELY RELATED TO ANY ONE OF THOSE 3 RECALLS AND I AM THEREFORE CALLING UPON THE NHTSA TO ASSIST WITH THIS BY ADDING THIS AS ANOTHER RECALL AND ALLOWING US TO GET REIMBURSED FOR THE ISSUE AS WELL AS TO PROTECT OTHER OWNERS THAT MAY ENCOUNTER THE SAME ISSUE.",
