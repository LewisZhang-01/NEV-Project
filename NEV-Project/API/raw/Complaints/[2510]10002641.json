WHEN FAILURE OCCURS THE VEHICLE CANNOT BE DRIVEN AND REQUIRES TOWING ON A FLAT BED TRAILER.      PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND INTERNET RESEARCH, SEE AUDIWORLD.COM A4 (B6) FORUM AND SEARCH \"COIL PACK\" , INDICATES A VIRTUAL CERTAINTY THAT THE COIL PACK WILL FAIL,  YET AUDI WILL NOT REPLACE/RECALL UNTIL FAILURE HAS OCCURRED.  THIS WILL LEAVE THE VEHICLE AND MOTORIST STRANDED ON THE ROAD SIDE UNTIL TOWED.      PRESENT WINTER CONDITIONS OF 20 DEGREES F WITH SNOW POSES AN UNNECESSARY RISK.     AN IMMEDIATE RECALL IS NECESSARY TO REPLACE DEFECTIVE COIL PACKS BEFORE FAILURE ON THE HIGHWAY.",
