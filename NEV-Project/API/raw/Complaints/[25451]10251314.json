THE FIRST SET OF TIRES THAT CAME WITH THE CAR WERE FROM THE MANUFACTURER AND WERE REPLACED AT 40,000 MILES. THE SECOND SET WAS REPLACED AT 15,000 MILES DUE TO SEVERE TIRE WEAR IN THE BACK OF THE CAR. THE DEALER DOES NOT WANT TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM I'M HAVING AND JUST TRIES EVERYTHING TO GET AROUND THIS. I HAVE READ MANY COMPLAINTS FROM CIVIC OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. EVENTUALLY SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET HURT IF THEY HAVE A BLOWN TIRE.*TR",
