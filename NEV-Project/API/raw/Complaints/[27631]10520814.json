        "summary": "NUMEROUS TIMES SINCE WE BOUGHT OUR FORD ESCAPE ON JUNE 1ST, 2010, WE HAVE HAD THE CAR SURGE WHEN STARTING OFF AND HAVING TO APPLY THE BRAKES QUICKLY.  THIS HAS HAPPENED SINCE WE FIRST GOT THE VEHICLE.  I HAVE ALSO FILED A REPORT (ODI # 10520754) FOR THE ENGINE GOING TO IDLE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS BECAUSE OF THE THROTTLE BODY NEEDING REPLACING.    FROM A DEAD STOP, WHEN WE WANT TO JUST MOVE UP A LITTLE BECAUSE THE CAR IN FRONT OF US HAS, WE HAVE PUSHED THE ACCELERATOR AND THEN BRAKE AND THE CAR SURGES FORWARD LIKE I MASHED THE GAS HARDER.  SEVERAL TIMES, THIS HAS CAUSED US TO HIT THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF US BUT RARELY CAUSING DAMAGE.  THE SURGING HAS HAPPENED PROBABLY 150 TIMES OVER THE 3 YEARS WE HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE.  BOTH MY WIFE AND I HAVE BUMPED INTO THE CAR IN FRONT OF US ABOUT 10 TIMES ONLY CAUSING MINIMAL DAMAGE AND NEVER FILED ON ANY INSURANCE.  THE FORD DEALER IN MEMPHIS (DOBBS FORD WOLFCHASE) TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS A CHARACTERISTIC OF A FRONT WHEEL DRIVE VEHICLE.  THIS WAS OUR FIRST FWD VEHICLE WE HAVE OWNED SINCE 1994.  OUR VEHICLE NOW HAS ABOUT 60600 MILES.  *TR",
