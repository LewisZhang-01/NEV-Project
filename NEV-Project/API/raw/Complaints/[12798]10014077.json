THIS WAS DONE AFTER A BULB WENT OUT DUE TO THE MOISTURE. ON THE SECOND VEHICLE I BROUGHT THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE DEALER AND THEY STATED IT WAS A COMMON PROBLEM ON THIS VEHICLE AND WAS NOT A SAFETY HAZARD. NOW I AM THINKING OF CONTACTING MY ATTORNEY TO LOOK INTO THIS MATTER. I DON'T WANT TO WAIT FOR AN ACCIDENT TO OCCUR OR A DEATH TO RESULT FROM SUCH A DEFECT. I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD BECAUSE WHEN I TAKE THE VEHICLE IN FOR THE ANNUAL STATE SAFETY INSPECTION THEY ALWAYS CHECK THE HEAD LIGHT CONDITION.  SO HEADLIGHT CONDITION IS A SAFETY CONCERN. JUST LIKE THE TIRE INCIDENT WITH FORD...DOES OLDSMOBILE/GM WANT NUMEROUS LAW SUITS OVER THIS MAJOR PROBLEM...I THINK NOT!*JB",
