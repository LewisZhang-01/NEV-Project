THEY SAID I GOT BAD FUEL, AND THAT IT WAS NOT UNDER THE 3YR/36,000. THAT I HAD TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR. I SINCE FOUND OUT THEY TOOK ME FOR A RIDE. THIS WAS BACK IN 2001. THIS YEAR I HAVE HAD MY FUSES BLOW 3 TIMES WITH IN A WEEK. I HAVE NOTICE THAT EVERY TIME THEY BLOW IS WHEN I'M BLOW A 1/4 TANK OF GAS. I CHANGED THE FUSE ON MAY 26 TH OF 2003 AND MAY 31 TH OF 2003 AND JUNE 2 2003. I THINK THERE IS A BIG PROBLEM WITH THIS. I WAS DRIVING 2 OF THE FOUR TIMES. I COULD HAVE HAD A WRECK.  *AK",
