IN DECEMBER OF 2002 I WAS TOLD BY BEST FORD I HAD ANOTHER CRACKED HEAD GASKET. THIS WOULD BE THE FOURTH TIME FORD WOULD BE REPLACING THIS RECALLED GASKET.  FORD WANTED TO CHARGE ME $1200 FOR THIS FORTH RECALLED GASKET BECAUSE MY WARRANTY WAS EXPIRED.  I FEEL THAT FORD SHOULD REPLACE A RECALLED PART WITH A \"NEW\" PART SO THAT THE SAME PROBLEM DOES NOT KEEP HAPPENING.  I AM EXTREMELY UPSET WITH FORD FOR NOT FIXING MY RECALL AND FEEL WHAT THEY DID WAS WRONG.*JB",
