THE PROBLEM IS WHEN THIS OCCURS DURING AN ACCIDENT, THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF THE BRITTLE PLASTIC TO BECOME SHRAPNEL AND PUNCTURE OR BECOME A FLYING PROJECTILE IN THE CAB OF THE VEHICLE.  IF IT IS CAUGHT BY THE AIRBAG, THE SPEED CAN BE ACCELERATED WHEN THE AIRBAG DEPLOYS.    WHEN WILL NHTSA ISSUE A RECALL ON THE DASHBOARD OF THESE TRUCKS.  THE BEZEL AND THE GLOVEBOX'S ARE ALSO SPLITTING AS WELL.    WHEN CAN THE RECALL BE EXPECTED.  I HAVE NOTED BEFORE THAT THIS PROBLEM EXIST ON NHTSA'S WEBSITE UNDER SEVERAL CATEGORIES..  IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE IF THE DASH CRACKS OR BREAKS OFF DURING AN ACCIDENT.      OWNERS ARE WAITING FOR A RECALL SO THAT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO HAVE TO PULL MONEY OUT OF THERE POCKET TO FIX REPAIRS ON ITEMS THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE A PROBLEM.",
