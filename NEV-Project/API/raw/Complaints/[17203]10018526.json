I HAVE ALWAY BEEN SUCH A BIG FAN OF CHRYSLER.  I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF LOOKING FOR A MINIVAN TO TRADE THIS CAR IN FOR.  NOW I STILL OWE MORE THAN $7000 ON THIS CAR AND STUCK WITH IT.  I HAVE NO CLUE AS TO WHAT I AM GOING TO DO.  I PRICED ENGINES.  THEY RANGE FROM $3600-$4800 AND THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE LABOR.  THE WORST PART IS I HAD MY CHILDREN IN THE CAR WHEN IT DIED.  LUCKILY NO ONE WAS HURT.   ALSO THE STEERING MAKES A FUNNY KNOCKING SOUND WHEN I TURN.   I AM NO LONGER A CHRYSLER FAN AND WILL MOST LIKELY NEVER OWN ANOTHER ONE.    *NLM",
