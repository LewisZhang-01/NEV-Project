IT IS EITHER EXTREMELY DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THE CAR INTO FIRST FROM A (I.E. TRAFFIC LIGHT) STOP. IT FEELS LIKE THERE IS SOMETHING BLOCKING THE SLOT FOR THE GEAR- SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT INTO 1ST IS TO COMPLETELY RESTART THE CAR.   IF I DRIVE 30 MILES IN A DAY AROUND TOWN ON THE STREET, THIS 1ST GEAR STICKING ISSUE HAPPENS 6/10 TRAFFIC LIGHTS.  I TOOK THE CAR INTO A SUBARU DEALERSHIP SHOP BUT THEY COULDN'T REPLICATE THE ISSUE DURING A TECHNICIAN TEST DRIVE.",
