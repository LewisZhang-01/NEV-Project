        "summary": "I AM  OPPOSED TO VEHICLES WITH MORE THAN ONE PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS, NEW HIGH INTENSITY \"BLUE\" HEADLIGHTS,  FOG LIGHTS, ACCESSORY HEADLIGHTS AND FLASHING BRAKE LIGHTS.  THESE ARE DANGEROUS, EXCESSIVE, AND BLINDING LIGHTS THAT AFFECT MY ABILITY TO DRIVE SAFELY.  THE BRIGHT BLUE HEADLIGHTS ARE BLINDING FROM BEHIND AND FROM ONCOMING VEHICLES.  I EVEN DRIVE WITH MY REAR VIEW MIRROR IN NIGHT MODE DURING DAY TO AVOID THE GLARE FROM THESE ALWAYS ON HEADLIGHTS.  FOG LIGHTS ARE REALLY USELESS ON WELL LIT CITY STREETS AND MANUFACTURER'S SHOULD INSTALL SWITCHES THAT DO NOT TURN THESE ON WITH OTHER HEADLIGHTS EASILY.  THESE LIGHTS ARE NOW IN THE SAME HELLISH BLUE, DOUBLING THE BLINDING EFFECT. I HAVE DRIVEN VEHICLES WITH SO CALLED FOG LIGHTS AND CANNOT SEE ANY BENEFIT IN WELL LIT CONDITIONS OR WHEN APPROACHING ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  MY FINAL ANNOYANCE IS THE USE OF FLASHING BRAKE LIGHT ATTACHED TO REAR WINDOWS OR THE TOP OF A TRUNK.  THESE ARE BECOMING LARGER  AND BRIGHTER.  THE CONSTANT FLASHING THAT I MUST ENDURE IN CITY TRAFFIC AT EACH STOP LIGHT REQUIRES AN EYESIGHT ADJUSTMENT BEFORE MY ABILITY TO SEE CLEARLY TO PROCEED.  I USUALLY PUT MY VISOR DOWN TO AVOID THIS FLASHING GLARE.  I ALSO WEAR SUNGLASSES NOW FOR NIGHT DRIVING TO AVOID BLINDING GLARE FROM ALL THE LIGHTS MENTIONED ABOVE.  THIS RESTRICTS THE ABILITY TO SEE OTHER NON-ELECTRIFIED OBJECTS ON OR NEAR  THE ROAD.  PLEASE CONSIDER REQUIRING MANUFACTURERS TO \"DIM THE LIGHTS\" AS A COURTESY TO OTHER MOTORISTS.  *NLM",
