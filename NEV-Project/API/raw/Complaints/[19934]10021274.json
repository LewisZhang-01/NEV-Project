        "summary": "THERE IS A STRONG SULFUR/ROTTEN EGG SMELL EMITTED BY THE VEHICLE WHETHER I DRIVE FOR ALONG TIME OR NOT.  SERVICE FOLKS OVER PHONE INDICATED THAT IT WAS JUST A \"NEW CAR\" SYNDROME AND WOULD GO AWAY SHORTLY.  11,000 MILES LATER IT HAS NOT GONE AWAY.  I LIVE IN ATLANTA WHERE WE HAVE LOW SULFUR CONTENT FUEL AND IT SHOULD NOT BE THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.  ON SHORT TRIPS, THE ENTIRE OUTSIDE AROUND THE CAR STINKS LIKE A SEWER WHEN I STOP.  AT TRAFFIC LIGHTS, THE SMELL IS REALLY BAD.  I CAN NOT USE THE FRESH AIR CIRCULATION BECAUSE OF THE SMELL.    SEEMS LIKE THE PCV SYSTEM MAY NOT BE WORKING RIGHT, BUT THERE ARE NO MILS ON INDICATING A PROBLEM.  IF THERE IS A CIRCULATION PROBLEM WHICH INCLUDES THE EXHAUST SYSTEM THERE COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT CO ISSUE THAT WE WOULDN'T BE AWARE OF UNTIL IT IS TOO LATE.  PLEASE HELP GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.  *AK",
