        "summary": "WHILE TEST DRIVING THE 94 MERCURY VILLAGER,  WITH ONLY 74000 MILES,  AT AROUND 40 MPH VEHICLE SHUT DOWN,  AND LOST ALL POWER TO BRAKES AND STEERING,  WITH NO WARNING.  THE MECHANIC AT THE DEALERSHIP INSISTED THAT THIS WAS A \"BUILT-IN MECHANISM\"  AND THAT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN OCCASIONALLY TO \"RESET THE COMPUTER SYSTEM.\"  OF COURSE THIS IS COMPLETELY FALSE.  THEY ARE TRYING TO SELL THIS VEHICLE IN EXTREMELY UNSAFE CONDITION AND FRANKLY I BELIEVE SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT IT.  THE DEALER,  GRAND AUTO MART IN ND STILL HAS THE VEHICLE FOR SALE FOR NEARLY $8,000.  AFTER READING THE OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THIS SITE,  I KNOW THAT THIS IS A MAJOR REPAIR,  AND WOULD COST ABOUT $4500 TO FIX.  BUYER BEWARE!  FOR THIS DEALERS INFO,  FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME.
