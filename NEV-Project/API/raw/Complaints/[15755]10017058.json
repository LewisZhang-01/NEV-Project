        "summary": "TRANSMISSION TOTALLY FAILED AT ABOUT 45,000 MILES.  CAR WAS BEING DRIVEN UP A SMALL HILL AND IT SOUNDED LIKE THE TRANSMISSION FELL OUT.  WAS UNABLE TO GO MORE THAN 20 MPH TO DRIVE TO SAFETY.  DEALER HAD VEHICLE FOR 1 WEEK.  TRANSMISSION WAS TOTALLY OVERHAULED.  AT THE TIME, A MECHANIC AT THE DEALER MENTIONED THAT GM WAS AWARE THAT THIS MODEL AND YEAR SILHOUETTE HAD A HISTORY OF THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM.  THAT REPAIR WAS OVER $1,000.  CAR AGAIN HAD THE PROBLEM AT 75,000 MILES - CONVENIENTLY WHEN THE WARRANTY RAN OUT BUT DESPITE NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS, THE DEALER COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  THE CAR WILL RUN FINE FOR ABOUT 25 MILES AND THEN TRANSMISSION WILL BEGIN TO WHINE AND WILL JERK WHEN SHIFTING UP THROUGH THE GEARS.  WHEN THE CAR IS PARKED THE PROBLEM WILL THEN NOT RETURN UNTIL THE CAR IS DRIVEN AGAIN FOR SOME TIME.   *JB",
