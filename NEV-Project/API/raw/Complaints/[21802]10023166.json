THIS MOVEMENT CAUSES A PARTIAL LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.  THE VEHICLE HAD ONLY 32K MILES ON IT.  THIS APPEARS TO BE A PREMATURE FAILURE AND A DEFECT OF BOTH TRACKS.  THIS FAILURE MODE IS DOCUMENTED BOTH ON THIS SITE AND ON MANY BMW FORUMS.  THE ENTIRE TRACK ASSEMBLY OF BOTH SEATS HAD TO BE REPLACED.  *NLM",
