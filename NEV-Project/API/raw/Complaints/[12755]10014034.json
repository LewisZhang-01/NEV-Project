        "summary": "I HAD PURCHASED THIS TRUCK ON DEC 19, 2002. THE NEXT DAY I DROVE IT TO TAMPA FL. WHILE ON THE WAY THERE AND WHILE IN TAMPA I HAD A FEW BRAKE FAILURES. WHEN I WAS COMING TO A STOP THE PEDAL SEEMED TO GET SOFT, THEN THEY WOULD GET REALLY HARD AND START PULSATING AND THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT STOP. I WOULD HAVE TO LET OFF THE BRAKES, AND TRY AGAIN. I WAS LUCKY THAT IT WAS EARLY IN THE MORNING AND MOST OF THE TIME I WAS NOT IN A LOT OF TRAFFIC, I WAS ABLE TO STOP THE VEHICLE. ON DEC 29,02. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED IT, THEY LOOKED AT IT AND SAID THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE BRAKES. IN JANUARY IT MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO ME ABOUT A 12  TIMES, ALL WITH THE SAME EFFECTS. IN FEB 03, I TOOK  IT BACK IN AND THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG. A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER THE PROBLEM WAS BACK AGAIN NOW HAPPENING MORE FREQUENTLY, NOW MARCH AND THE PROBLEM HAS HAPPEN TO ME JUST ABOUT EVERY WEEK AT LEAST 4 TO 5  TIMES A WEEK. ON THE MORNING OF MAR 28 03, I WAS TAKING MY CHILD TO DAY CARE WHILE COMING TO A STOP AT A LIGHT. I COULD NOT STOP THE TRUCK, I LET OFF THE BRAKES ABOUT 2  MORE TIMES, THEN I FINALLY JUST APPLIED THE BRAKES AS HARD AS I COULD AND GOT IT TO STOP A FEW INCHES FROM THE CAR THAT WAS STOPPED IN FRONT OF ME AT THAT POINT I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP, THEY SAID BRING IT IN. I DROPPED IT OFF THE SAME DAY. WHEN I CALLED THEM THE FOLLOWING WEEK ON APRIL 1 2003. THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT, BUT THEY WERE GOING TO REPLACE THE BRAKE BOOSTER AND MASTER CYLINDER AND A CHECK VALVE. THEY TOLD ME THAT WITH ALL THE INFORMATION THAT I HAD GIVEN THEM AND FROM WHAT OTHER MECHANICS SAID IT WOULD HAVE TO BE THE THREE COMPONENTS THEY REPLACED. THAT NIGHT MY TRUCK WAS READY. I WAS VERY CONFIDENT THAT THE REPAIRS WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM BUT I WAS WRONG ON APR 06 03. WHILE OUT AND ABOUT AND COMING HOME I APPLIED THE BRAKES THE TRUCK THEN SEEM TO SLOW DOWN, THEN THE BRAKES GOT HARD AGAIN AND STARTED PULSATING AT THE BOTTOM. *JB",
