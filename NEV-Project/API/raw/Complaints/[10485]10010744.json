AT 30,000 MILES, I HAD TO HAVE THEM REPLACED. AT 47,000 MILES, AGAIN RESURFACED AND AT AROUND 60,000 MILES, AGAIN I HAD TO REPLACE THEM.   THIS IS NOT NEW TO ME. THIS IS MY FOURTH JEEP , AND HAVE HAD SIMILAR RESULTS ON ALL OF THE JEEPS THAT I HAVE OWNED. THIS IS NOT JUST MY EXPERIENCE, I KNOW OF MANY PEOPLE, WHOM I WORK WITH AND FRIENDS, THAT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT I HAVE HAD.   I BELIEVE THIS IS CAUSE BY A FEW DIFFERENT REASONS FOR THIS AND UNFORTUNATELY, IT ALL COMES BACK TO COST FOR THE CAR MANUFACTURES.  THEY ARE MAKING THEIR ROTORS THINNER, AND OF POORER QUALITY MATERIALS.  THIS MEANS THAT THEY CAN NOT GET RID OF HEAT PROPERLY AND THEREFORE FOR WARP.    *NLM",
