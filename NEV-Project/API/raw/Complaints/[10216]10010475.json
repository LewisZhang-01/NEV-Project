TONE RINGS, STRUTS, SUSPENSION, FRONT BRAKES, REAR BRAKES, BEARINGS, CV JOINTS, MASTER CYLINDER, AMONG OTHER REPLACEMENTS. OVER BUMPS, SMALL HILLS, STRAIGHT ROADS, ANYTIME COMING TO A STOP, VEHICLE INTERMITTENTLY FAILS TO STOP COMPLETELY. HAVE PUMPED BRAKES AND FOUND THAT BRAKE PEDAL GETS HARD AND LOUD, STILL DOES NOT HELP TO STOP VEHICLE. STEERING WHEEL FEELS LOOSE AT WHEN THIS HAPPENS. BRAKE PEDAL ALSO KICKS BACK, SOMETIMES WITH EXCESSIVE FORCE, MAKES A LOAD GRINDING NOISE. CONTROLLING THE CAR BECOMES DIFFICULT AS LOSS OF BRAKE PRESSURE AND STEERING WHEEL ROCKING (ON DECENT OF SMALL HILL) COMBINED MAKE FOR A DEADLY COMBINATION. I AM BEING FORCED TO PURCHASE A BETTER VEHICLE, NOT EVER FORD AGAIN.   *JB",
