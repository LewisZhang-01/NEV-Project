DUE TO THE EXCESSIVE FORCE NEEDED TO TURN THE VEHICLE SLIGHTLY AND THE UNEXPECTED FREQUENT OCCURRENCE OF THE PROBLEM, MAKES THIS A SAFETY VIOLATION AND COULD CAUSE A CRASH OR EVEN A LIFE.   THE DEALER WAS CONTACTED ON THIS AND I WAS TOLD MY PARTICULAR VIN MODEL NUMBER WAS NOT COVERED.  I WAS ALSO INFORMED BY THE DEALER THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS NOT OCCURRING ON 2010 MODELS AND THAT THEY HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY COMPLAINTS FROM OWNERS OF 2010 COBALTS.  IF THIS IS THE CASE, WHY ARE SOME 2010 MODELS COVERED WHILE OTHERS ARE NOT?  I FEEL THE DEALER DOES NOT WANT TO COVER THIS RECALL EVEN THOUGH IT IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND THEY ARE PICKING AND CHOOSING WHICH VEHICLES TO REPAIR.  IF THERE IS A RECALL, THEN THE VEHICLE SHOULD BE FIXED.  THERE IS A RECALL AND T HE NHTSA SHOULD MAKE THEM REPAIR ALL 2010S NEEDING THIS REPAIR AND THE DEALER SHOULD NOT HAVE THE OPTION TO PICK AND CHOOSE.  *TR",
