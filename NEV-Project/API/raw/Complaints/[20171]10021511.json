        "summary": "THE DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT AXLE SHAFT SEAL ON THE DIFFERENTIAL LEAKS FLUID, WHICH RUNS ONTO THE HOT EXHAUST PIPE WHICH PRODUCES A SMELL AND A POSSIBLE FIRE HAZARD  I BOUGHT THIS 1999 GMC SUBURBAN VEHICLE USED AT CROWN MOTORS IN CHARLEVOIX MICHIGAN ON 02/02/01, WITH 21904 MILES ON IT. ABOUT 6 MONTHS AFTER I BOUGHT THE SUBURBAN I STARTED SMELLING A BURNT OIL ODOR WHEN I WOULD GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE AFTER DRIVING THE VEHICLE.  I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THE ODOR WAS.  ABOUT A YEAR AGO I HAD MY SUBURBAN SERVICED AND WAS TOLD THAT THE FRONT DRIVERS SIDE DIFFERENTIAL SEAL WAS LEAKING. THIS WAS TOLD TO ME AS A QUITE COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS TYPE VEHICLE.  I WENT TO CROWN MOTORS AND TOLD THEM ABOUT THE PROBLEM. I WAS REFERRED TO THE SERVICE MANAGER WHO SAID THAT HE WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE VEHICLE HAD ALMOST 70,000 MILES ON IT.  THIS IS MY THIRD GMC SUBURBAN AND I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SATISFIED WITH THE WAY THAT THEY LAST.  I BELIEVE THAT IF GMC HAS A PROBLEM AND POSSIBLE FIRE HAZARD WITH THESE NEWER VEHICLES THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE A RECALL ON THEM AND GET THE PROBLEM FIXED BEFORE A FIRE STARTS AND SOME INNOCENT PERSON GETS TRAPPED AND KILLED BY THEIR PROBLEM.  I AM NOT SURE OF THE DATE THAT I CONTACTED THE SERVICE MANAGER AT CROWN MOTORS OR THE EXACT DATE THAT THE LEAK WAS FOUND BUT I AM USING TODAY AS THE INCIDENT DATE.  THANK YOU.  HOPE YOU CAN DO SOMETHING BEFORE SOME GETS KILLED OR INJURED BY A FIRE.   *JB",
