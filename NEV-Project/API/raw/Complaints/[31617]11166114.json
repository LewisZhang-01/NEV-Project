DODGE WILL NOT HELP REPLACE OR REPAIR THIS EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE. I WAS TOLD BY A CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE.THE TIPM IS THE COMMAND CENTER FOR ALL ELECTRICAL FUNCTIONS.  THERE ARE REPORTS OF VEHICLES STALLING WHILE DRIVING,  AIR BAG ISSUES,  WINDSHIELD WIPER ISSUES,  FUEL PUMP ISSUES.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PART TO MALFUNCTION.  YET, THEY WILL NOT HELP REPLACE THIS.  THERE WAS A LAWSUIT FILED FOR THESE ISSUES. WHY ISN'T THERE A RECALL.  MY FAMILY IS BEING PUT IN DANGER! DODGE TOLD ME NOT TO DRIVE IT IF I FEEL ITS UNSAFE.  WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? THIS IS MY VEHICLE THAT I BOUGHT THINKING IT WAS A SAFE RELIABLE VEHICLE. THIS PART IS OVER 1000 TO FIX. PLEASE INVESTIGATE AND RECALL!  THIS IS A DEATH TRAP WAITING TO HAPPEN NOT ONLY FOR THOSE DRIVING BUT FOR OTHERS ON THE ROAD. PEOPLE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO  POTENTIALLY LOSE THERE LIFES DUE TO A FAULTY PART.",
