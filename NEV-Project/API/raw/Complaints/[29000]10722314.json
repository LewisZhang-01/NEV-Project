        "summary": "1) THE AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY IN AN ACCIDENT SEVERAL YEARS AGO ( APPROX. DECEMBER, 2011 - MILEAGE WAS APPROX. 45,000) WHEN THE CAR COLLIDED WITH AN ONCOMING CAR AND WAS DAMAGED ON THE FRONT END AND DRIVER'S SIDE. NO ONE WAS INJURED.  DURING THE PAST 2 OR 3 YEARS, I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE DRIVER'S SIDE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT HAS BEEN GOING ON AND OFF FOR DAYS AT A TIME. IT SEEMS TO BE AFFECTED BY HEAT AND HUMIDITY. IT SEEMS TO GO ON WHEN THE WEATHER IS HUMID AND OFF WHEN THE AIR IS DRY, AT ALL TIMES OF THE YEAR. I AM NOT SURE WHETHER THE AIRBAG WOULD DEPLOY WHEN IT IS NECESSARY.     2) DURING THE PAST YEAR, THE POWER STEERING HAS MAKING A LOUD GRINDING NOISE WHEN I TURN THE STEERING  WHEEL EITHER RIGHT OR LEFT. A MECHANIC WHO WORKED ON IT SAID HE PUT A CLAMP ON IT AND REFILLED THE STEERING FLUID, WHICH HELPED FOR A FEW WEEKS, BUT THE PROBLEM HAS RETURNED. SO FAR THE STEERING HAS WORKED WELL, BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT POWER STEERING IS DEFECTIVE AND WEARING OUT TOO SOON.THE MECHANIC SAID IT WAS SAFE TO DRIVE.",
