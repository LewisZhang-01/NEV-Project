        "summary": "ON 4/19/19 I MISFUELED MY DIESEL VEHICLE. I STOPPED THE PROCESS IMMEDIATELY AND CALLED FORD FROM THE FILLING STATION. THE FORD SERVICE CENTER SAID THAT I SHOULD AVOID TURNING THE ENGINE ON, OR EVEN PLACING THE ENGINE IN ACCESSORY MODE BECAUSE IT WOULD ENGAGE THE FUEL PUMP AND FLOOD THE SYSTEM WITH GASOLINE.  WHEN THE TOW TRUCK ARRIVED, IT BECAME CLEAR THAT I COULD NOT PUT THE VEHICLE IN NEUTRAL TO BE WINCHED ONTO THE FLATBED TOW TRUCK WITHOUT TURNING ON THE ACCESSORY MODE.  I CALLED FORD FOR AN ALTERNATIVE.  FORD RECOMMENDED THAT I DISCONNECT A CABLE BENEATH THE TRUCK THAT WOULD DISENGAGE THE TRANSMISSION AND ALLOW THE TRUCK TO MOVE.  BECAUSE I COULD NOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS, I HAD TO TURN ON THE ACCESSORY TO GET THE TRUCK OUT OF PARK FOR TOWING.  THIS CAUSED ABOUT $12,000 IN DAMAGE TO THE FUEL SYSTEM.  MORE TO THE POINT OF THIS COMPLAINT, I LATER DISCOVERED THAT THIS PROCEDURE IS NOT IN THE MANUAL FOR MY TRUCK.  FURTHER, THE PROCEDURE THAT IS IN THE MANUAL WAS NOT MENTIONED.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FORD MANUAL CONTAINS A PROCEDURE THAT DOES NOT APPLY TO THE TRUCK.  IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT FORD IS RECOMMENDING A PROCEDURE THAT IS INHERENTLY MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE PROCEDURE IN THE MANUAL.",
