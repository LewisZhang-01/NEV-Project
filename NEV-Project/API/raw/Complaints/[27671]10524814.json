SHE SWERVED INTO THE GRASS AND IT FINALLY ROLLED TO A STOP. PUMPING THE BRAKES DID NOT WORK AND THERE WAS A BRAKE LIGHT THAT CAME ON AND IT WAS MAKING A TERRIBLE GRINDING SOUND. SHE SHUT THE VEHICLE OFF, WAITED FOR A FEW MINUTES TO COLLECT HER THOUGHTS AND WHEN SHE TURNED IT BACK ON EVERYTHING WAS O.K. NO LIGHT, NO BRAKE PROBLEMS. FROM WHAT I READ ON-LINE THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE AND NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND OR A RECALL FOR THIS BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED. *TR",
