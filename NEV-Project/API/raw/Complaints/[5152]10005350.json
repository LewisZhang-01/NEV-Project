WILL START RIGHT UP AGAIN AS SOON AS I PUT TRANSMISSION IN NEUTRAL AND TURN KEY. OFTEN WHEN DRIVING THE ENGINE WILL JERK REAL HARD LIKE I JUST DROVE OVER A SPEED BUMP, BUT ENGINE DOES NOT KILL. THE ENGINE LIGHT FLASHES FOR A SECOND. DEALER SAYS NOTHING SHOWS ON COMPUTER SO THERES NOTHING HE CAN DO. CHRYSLER IN DETROIT WAS CALLED AND SAID THE SAME THING. THEY WERE NO HELP AT ALL.  I HAVE ALMOST BEEN HIT FROM BEHIND SEVERAL TIMES DUE TO THIS PROBLEM. I SEE OTHERS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM POSTED ALSO. HAPPENS ABOUT ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS OR SO. IT SEEMS IF THE DEALERS COMPUTER DOESN'T GIVE THEM A CODE THEY ARE LOST AND CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP. IT'S A VERY FRUSTRATING AND DANGEROUS SITUATION TO BE IN!",
