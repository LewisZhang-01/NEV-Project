SO I WENT TO AN AUTO SHOP TO MAKE SURE THAT STEERING FLUID IS AT ITS PROPER LEVELS; IT WAS. THEN A WEEK LATER, THE STEERING STARTED TO LOCK FREQUENTLY WHILE TAKING A RIGHT OR LEFT TURN. I THEN WENT TO ANOTHER  MECHANICAL SHOP FOR A SECOND OPINION AND THEY FOUND NOTHING. JUST YESTERDAY(2/9/2019), MY VEHICLE STARED TO HUM AND THE STEERING WHEEL ONCE AGAIN TRIED TO LOCK ON ME WHILE MAKING ANOTHER TURN AND ALMOST CAUSED ME 2 ACCIDENTS ON A MAJOR ROAD. I WAS THEN TOLD TO LOOK UP TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY RECALLS ON MY VEHICLE AND I FOUND NOTHING BUT I DID FIND THE EXACT SAME ISSUES THAT MY SATURN IS EXPERIENCING CURRENTLY FROM PREVIOUS RECALLS",
