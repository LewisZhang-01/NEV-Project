I AM NOT TALKING HUGE POTHOLES OR EXTREME DROPOFFS, BUT BUMPS AS LOW AS APPROXIMATELY. 2 TO 3 INCHES.  THE PROBLEM HAPPENS MOST OFTEN NEAR MY HOME TRAVELING AT 35 MPH, USING THE BRAKES TO SLOW TO AROUND 28 MPH WHEN I HIT THE 2 TO 3 INCH BUMP.  AT THIS POINT THE TRUCK STARTS COASTING AND THE BRAKE PEDAL IS STIFF, APPROXIMATELY. 10 FEET PAST CLEARING THE BUMP THE BRAKING IS RESTORED.   I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS NORMAL FOR ABS.    *NLM",
