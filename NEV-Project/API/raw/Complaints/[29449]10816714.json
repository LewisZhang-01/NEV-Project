CAN MANUALLY MOVE BOTH BLADES FREELY, NO BINDING, IN UNISON VALIDATING LINKAGE BETWEEN THE TWO BLADE ARMS WERE STILL CONNECTED.  SUSPECTED MOTOR SHAFT/SPLINE CONNECTING TO THE \"BLADE TRANSMISSION\" WAS DISCONNECTED, STRIPPED, OR FELL OFF.  TO ENSURE NOT AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE, REMOVED 25 AMP FUSE (NO. 29) FROM ENGINE COMPARTMENT FUSE BUSS AND INSPECTED FUSE.  FUSE INTACT AND IN LIKE NEW CONDITION.  REINSTALLED THE FUSE RESUMING MOTOR FUNCTION.  DROVE THE VEHICLE TO  VALENTINE GMC BUICK, FAIRBORN, OHIO AND ASKED SERVICE MGR IF A TSB REFERENCING THIS SAFETY ISSUE HAD BEEN REPORTED.  THE SERVICE MGR DID NOT COMMENT; INSTEAD HE SHOWED ME AN ILLUSTRATED PARTS BREAKDOWN OF THE AREA IN QUESTION POINTING TO THE BLADE TRANSMISSION.  TO CONFIRM MY DIAGNOSIS, HE HAD ONE OF THEIR MECHANICS INSPECT THE AREA IN QUESTION PENDING THE REMOVAL OF A PANEL.  SERVICE MGR FOLLOWED BY STATING I \"MIGHT\" NOT HAVE TO PAY, DEPENDING ON THE PROBLEM.  THE INSPECTION PROVED IT WAS INDEED THE WIPER BLADE TRANSMISSION P/N 25948436, GM AT FAULT.  THE SERVICE MGR ALSO STATED PARTS ON-HAND FOLLOWED BY A $250.00 QUOTE TO REPLACE.  WITH THE AREA IN QUESTION APART, I CONCURRED WITH THE WORK WHICH WAS DONE IN A FEW MINUTES.  AFTER EXAMINING THE BILL, I CROSSED THIS PART NUMBER ON-LINE AND FOUND COUNTLESS GENUINE GM SOURCES CHARGING FAR LESS; $95.16, TO BE EXACT (LESS SHIPPING AND INCLUDES 1 YR WARRANTY).  I BROUGHT IT UP TO THEIR ATTENTION AND WAS TOLD THEIR LIST PRICE IS $199.95 WITH THE SAME 1 YEAR WARRANTY, AND THE LABOR COST WAS DISCOUNTED DOWN TO $85.00 PER HOUR.  REGARDLESS OF COSTS, THE FACT REMAINS; LOW OR NO VISIBILITY COULD RESULT IN A CRASH CAUSING INJURY OR DEATH UNLESS ADDRESSED.  RECOMMEND RESEARCHING OTHER VEHICLES CARRYING THIS PART FOR POTENTIAL FAILURE.",
