        "summary": "THE FOLLOWING HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR YEARS AND IS REACHING EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS NATIONWIDE CAUSING A SAFETY HAZARD FOR DRIVERS OF AMERICAN MADE AUTOMOBILES -- ALL MAKES, MODELS, AND  YEARS.  THERE IS AN EPIDEMIC RISE IN THE NUMBER OF CARS DRIVING WITH ONLY ONE HEADLIGHT BECAUSE OF POOR ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING/MANUFACTURING OF THAT SYSTEM IN AMERICAN MADE CARS.  I DO NOT SEE THAT PROBLEM WITH FOREIGN MADE CARS.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT IN 2003 AMERICAN CAR MANUFACTURERS CANNOT BUILD A CAR WHERE HEADLIGHTS WILL NOT FAIL -- AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT FAILURES CAUSED BY ACCIDENTS OR IMPACTS.  IN OHIO IT WAS REALLY BAD, AND AS I MOVE AROUND THE COUNTRY IT IS NOT ISOLATED AT ALL, THERE ARE MILLIONS OF HEADLIGHT FAILURES IN AMERICAN CARS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR AGE OR YEAR.  THIS IS A WIDE-SPREAD PROBLEM THAT CAN BE TRACED TO AMERICAN CAR MANUFACTURING AND ENGINEERING PROBLEMS.  HEADLIGHTS ARE A MAJOR SAFETY ITEM IN A CAR, AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE FAILING AT SUCH AN ALARMING RATE.  I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT NO-ONE HAS TAKEN ACTION TO DATE REGARDING THIS OBVIOUS ISSUE.   *NLM",
