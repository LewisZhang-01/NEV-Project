        "summary": "LAST SUMMER (JULY 2002) DURING A MILITARY MOVE FROM GA TO AZ I NOTICED THAT MY WINDSHIELD HAD A LARGE PIECE OF GLASS MISSING ON THE OUTTER RIGHT EDGE THAT YOU COULD NOT SEE UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY GOT RIGHT UP ON THE WINDSHIELD.  PART OF IT WAS VISIBLE TO AND PART OF IT WAS HIDDEN BEHIND THE RUBBER SEAL THAT IS AROUND THE WINDSHIELD.  THIS WINDSHIELD WAS ACTUALLY INSTALLED WITH THIS PIECE MISSING FROM IT WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS BUILT AND SENT TO THE DEALERSHIP.  ALSO, THE REAR GLASS HATCH, GAS SHOCK  TWISTED FROM ITS ORIGINAL POSITION AND CAUSED THE WINDOW TO BE OFF CENTER BY ABOUT AN INCH OR MORE.  AFTER FIXING IT THREE TIMES IT HAD TO BE REPLACED.  BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS (THE WINDSHIELD AND THE GAS SHOCK) HAVE BEEN FIXED BY MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND THUS FAR HAVE HELD UP.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER COMPLAINTS THAT I HAVE ON MY VEHICLE THAT INCLUDE THE ELECRICAL SYSTEM NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.  WHEN YOU TURN THE TRUCK ON SOMETIMES ALL THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS STAY ON AS WELL AS THE INTERIOR LIGHTS AND YOU HAVE TO SHUT THE TRUCK DOWN AND BACK ON SEVERAL TIMES IN ORDER  FOR THEM TO GO OUT.  THE TRUCK WILL SOMETIMES STALL AT TAKE OFF OR WILL LURCH WHILE SHIFITING INTO A HIGHER GEAR AND HAS TOTALLY SHUT DOWN WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD ON A FEW OCCASIONS.  THE TRIM PAINT ON THE DOORS, BOTH FRONT AND PASSENGER HAS FADED THERE ARE RUSTED SPOTS IN THE PAINT ON THE TOP OF THE VEHICLE, AND THE HOOD HAS A VERY BAD ORANGE PEEL EFFECT ON IT WITH GRIT IN THE PAINT. THE LEFT REAR SPEAKER HAS BUSTED AND THE PANEL ON THE REAR HATCH BELOW HAS BROKEN LOOSE AS WELL AS ONE OF THE PLASTIC BRACKET COVERS ON THE BACK OF THE PASSENGER SEATS.   PE04045.PCO",
