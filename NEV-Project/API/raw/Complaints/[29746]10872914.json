I RETRIED THIS NUMEROUS TIMES WITH SAME RESULT.  I PUT IT IN GEAR AND WENT DOWN THE DRIVEWAY AND HAD NO BRAKES.  I BACKED UP AND STILL HAD NO BRAKES.  FINALLY AFTER SHUTTING OFF THE VEHICLE THE BRAKES WENT BACK TO NORMAL.  I WAS ON MY WAY TO WORK TRAVELING ABOUT 40 MPH AND APPROACHED A STOP SIGN AND HAD NO BRAKES AGAIN.   THE PETAL WENT TO THE FLOOR AND IT FELT LIKE THE ABS MAY HAVE BEEN SLOWING THE VEHICLE. IF THERE WAS A CAR IN FRONT OF ME OR IF I HADN'T STARTED BRAKING WAY EARLY I WOULD HAVE CRASHED.   AFTER THAT I FINISHED MY DRIVE TO WORK WITHOUT FURTHER ISSUES.  I CALLED THE MANAGER OF THE DEALERSHIP AND HAVE NOT HEARD BACK FROM HIM YET.",
