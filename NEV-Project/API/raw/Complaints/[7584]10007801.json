I HAVE ARGUED WITH 2 DEALERS ON MANY OCCASIONS THAT CARS JUST DON'T SHAKE LIKE THAT FROM THE BRAKES EVERY 10,000 MILES.  THEY TOLD ME IT WAS DRIVER ERROR AND THEY HAD NOT HEARD OF ANY COMPLAINTS BEFORE.  THEY PUT THESE NEW \"SHIM KITS\" ON MY FRONT ROTORS SO THAT THEY DON'T WEAR DOWN -DIDN'T HELP.  TRUST ME - LEMON LAW DOESN'T HELP.  MY HUSBAND EVENTUALLY WENT TO ADVANCED AUTO AND BOUGHT ROTORS & PADS FOR $80.00 AND I HAVEN'T HAD A PROBLEM SINCE.  IT'S A SHAME MY HUSBAND HAD TO PUT CRAPPY BRAKES ON THE CAR FOR IT TO STOP SHAKING CONSTANTLY.  KEEP THAT IN MIND BEFORE YOU GO TO THE DEALER.",
