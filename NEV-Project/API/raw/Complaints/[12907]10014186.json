THIS HAS HAPPENED ONCE BEFORE APPROXIMATELY. 2 MONTHS AGO.  BOTH TIMES I WAS GOING DOWNHILL.   I HAVE FOUND OTHERS WHO HAVE FILED COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SAME THING.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS ISSUE THAT MAZDA NEEDS TO ADDRESS AND CORRECT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  ALSO THE OWNERS OF THESE TRIBUTE'S NEED TO BE COMPENSATED FOR THE COST OF SO CALLED REPAIRS.  MINE IS GOING TO THE DEALERSHIP APRIL 17, 2003 TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIND THE PROBLEM. *JB",
