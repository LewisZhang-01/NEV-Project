THIS IS THE SAME PROBLEM THAT OTHERS HAVE BEEN HAVING SUCH AS COMPLAINT #'S 724822, 9001529, 890575, 882388, 747014. I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE USED FROM A DODGE DEALERSHIP AND AFTER ONE DAY TOOK IT TO THEM AND DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM WITH THEM AND WAS TOLD BY SOME IN THE SERVICE DEPT. THAT THEY WERE NOT ORIGINAL MIRRORS. I KNOW THAT THESE ARE THE ORIGIANL MIRRORS BY SEEING OVER 100 TRUCKS ON THE ROAD WITH THE SAME ONES ON THEM. I FOUND THAT A SORRY WAY TO GET BY WITHOUT DISCUSSING THE PROBLEM WITH ME, I WAS NOT ASKING THEM TO FIX THEM JUST IF THERE WAS A WAY TO DO IT. REGENT DODGE IN NASHVILLE IS A SORRY EXCUSE FOR A DODGE DEALERSHIP AND NO ONE SHOULD BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM, AND ESPECIALLY TAKE ANYTHING TO THEM TO BE WORKED ON. I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HELP ON GETTING THIS PROBLEM TAKEN CARE OF SINCE IT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH BEING ABLE TO SEE OTHER DRIVERS WHILE DRIVING.",
