        "summary": "I STARTED LEASING A 2002 VW PASSAT 1.8 IN OCTOBER OF 2001, THE ENGINE MALFUNCTION LIGHT CAME ON(FLASHING) IN SEPTEMBER OF 2002, AND THE VEHICLE LOST POWER. IT WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE CAR HAD APPROXIMATELY 11,000 MILES ON IT.   I WAS ADVISED IGNITION COIL #3 WAS BAD.  THREE MONTHS LATER, IT HAPPENED AGAIN.  AT THAT TIME I WAS ADVISED COIL #2 & 3 HAD TO BE REPLACED.  TWO WEEKS LATER, IT HAPPENED A THIRD TIME.  I CONTACTED VW DIRECTLY WHO ASSIGNED ME A CARE # & ADVISED THAT ALL 4 COILS WOULD BE REPLACED AND THAT SHOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  THE DEALERSHIP HAD MY CAR FOR 2 WEEKS AND I WAS TOLD ALL 4 COILS WERE REPLACED.  3 WEEKS PASSED AFTER ALL 4 COILS WERE REPLACED AND THE MALFUNCTION LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN.  THIS IS THE 4TH INCIDENT.  THE CAR IS SET TO GO BACK IN THE SHOP THIS WEEK.  I'M VERY DISPLEASED AT THE WAY VW  HAS HANDLED THIS SITUATION.  I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY TYPE OF REASSURANCE FROM VW THAT THIS MATTER WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF APPROPRIATELY.  I WILL NOT TAKE MY 2002 VEHICLE ON LONG TRIPS AS I FEAR I WILL BE STRANDED.  I BOUGHT A NEW VEHICLE TO AVOID THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS.",
