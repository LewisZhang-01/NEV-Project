GOODYEAR WAS UNWILLING TO RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM AS A DEFECT, BUT AFTER MULTIPLE CALLS TO CUSTOMER SUPPORT, THEY REPLACED THE 3 TIRES EXHIBITING THE PROBLEM WITH A DIFFERENT MODEL TIRE AT NO COST AS A MATTER OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.  SINCE MANY PEOPLE HAVE POSTED SIMILAR PROBLEMS, AND INDEED ANOTHER CUSTOMER WAS IN THE SHOP WITH THE SAME PROBLEM WHEN I WAS THERE, AN INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE PERFORMED.
