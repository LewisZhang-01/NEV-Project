THIS CAUSED THE POWER HARNESS TO SHIFT TO REST ON TOP OF THE SWAY BAR. THE CONSTANT RUBBING AGAINST THE SWAY BAR CAUSED 3 WIRES TO SHORT, BLOWING ALL FUSES AND THE COMPUTER MODULE.  A SUBARU REP SAID THERE WAS ONE OTHER CASE LIKE THIS IN THE UP OF MICHIGAN. BUT HE BLAMED PACKED SNOW IN THE WHEEL WELLS. THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE IN NORTHERN ILLINOIS IN MAY. SUBARU ALSO CONFIRMED HAD I BEEN IN TRAFFIC I WOULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED. NO ONE HAS EXPLAINED WHY THE WIRE TIES BROKE CAUSING THE POWER HARNESS TO MOVE. AT 40000 IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, AND WE HAD TO PAY THE DEDUCTIBLE FOR THE EXTENDED WARRANTY, EVEN THOUGH PARTIES HAVE SAID IT IS POSSIBLE THE WIRE TIES BROKE WHILE THE CAR WAS IN WARRANTY. *TS   *NLM    **DIMSII IVIES ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12-12-02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**762507",
