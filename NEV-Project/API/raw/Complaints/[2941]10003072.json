ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO (EARLY JANUARY 2003), I STARTED UP THE RODEO AND HEARD A VERY LOUD SOUND COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD, WHICH CONTINUED EVEN WHEN I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION AND REMOVED THE KEYS.  THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE SOUND WAS TO UNPLUG THE ABS FUSE.  WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP, THEY SAID THE ABS CONTROL MODULE HAD TO BE REPLACED (ABOUT A $500 REPAIR.) FROM MY INTERNET RESEARCH, THIS IS A FREQUENT PROBLEM WITH MID- TO LATE-90S RODEOS.",
