THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THIS YEAR AND MAKE OF MERCEDES. IF YOU OWN ONE OF THESE CARS IT IS WELL KNOWN YOU WILL NEED TO REPLACE YOUR HARNESS. MERCEDES KNOWS OF THIS PROBLEM AND DOES NOTHING TO HELP. I HAVE A PROBLEM WHEN MY CAR WILL NOT PASS SMOG UNTIL I REPLACE MINE. I THINK MERCEDES SHOULD A THE LEAST REPLACE THE PART AT NO CHARGE. THOUSANDS OF THESE CARS WERE MADE AND AT A COST OF OVER $500.00 PER HARNESS THIS IS A LOT OF MONEY FROM CONSUMERS. IF YOU CAN HELP GREAT. THANKS IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR HELP.   DAVE MYERS",
