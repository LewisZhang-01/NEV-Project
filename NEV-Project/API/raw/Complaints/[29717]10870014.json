THE HARNESS STRAPS WERE IMPROPERLY ROUTED ON THE CHILD'S LEFT SIDE OF THE SAFEGUARD PLATE - INSTEAD OF COMING THROUGH THE BOTTOM SLOT AND OUT THE TOP SLOT, BOTH HARNESS STRAPS ON ONE SIDE WERE COMING THROUGH THE TOP SLOT. THIS WAS A MISTAKE DONE IN THE FACTORY AS THEY ARE ROUTED AND THEN SEWN INTO THE SEAT - AND THE ROUTING CAN NOT BE CHANGED AFTER IT IS SEWN.",
