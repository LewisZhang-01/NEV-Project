WHILE FORWARD FACING, I WOULD PHYSICALLY PUT ALL MY WEIGHT ONTO HARNESS TIGHTENING BELT. THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE IN REAR FACING SINCE YOU MUST PULL UP. COSCO WAS NO HELP. I CALLED NHTSA FOR INFO & NEVER RECEIVED RETURN CALL. I EVENTUALLY THREW THE SEAT IN GARBAGE AFTER CUTTING IT INTO PIECES SO NO ONE WOULD TAKE IT OUT OF GARBAGE & TRY TO USE IT.  *NLM",
