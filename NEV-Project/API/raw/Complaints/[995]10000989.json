MANY WITNESSES DOCUMENT FUMES. I AM AFRAID OF FIRE RISK AND OF THE HEALTH RISKS OF FUMES. I HAVE A SMALL CHILD AND I HAVE ASTHMA, SO THIS IS A HARMFUL SITUATION. ANYTHING  LEFT IN CAR SMELLS LIKE A GAS STATION. I HAVE REPORTED THIS TO THE DEALER FIVE TIMES. THEY SAY THEY CANNOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG. STARTED AT 20K MILES. NOW 30K. ALSO HAD CYLINDER #3 FUEL INJECTOR FAIL AT 27K. (AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION SENSOR WENT AT 20K AND MOLD FOUND IN VAPOR CANISTER.) CHRYSLER WON'T HELP.
