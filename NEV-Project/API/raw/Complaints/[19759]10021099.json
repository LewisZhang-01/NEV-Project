I HAVE HAD 3 FUEL PUMPS REPLACED ALREADY, AND MY CAR HAS LESS THAN 21,000 MILES. DUE TO THE INFERIOR DESIGN OF THE TANK AND FUEL PUMP, THE PUMP CLOGS TOO EASILY, THEN BURNS OUT LEAVING THE CAR STRANDED.     THE DESIGN OF THE PUMP HAS A FINE MESH SCREEN BEFORE THE LARGER SCREEN SO THE LARGE MESH SCREEN IS SIMPLY USELESS! THE SMALL SCREEN CLOGS UP FROM LARGE FLAKES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT BY THE LARGE SCREEN IF THE PUMP HAD NOT BEEN DESIGNED BY RETARDS.*AK",
