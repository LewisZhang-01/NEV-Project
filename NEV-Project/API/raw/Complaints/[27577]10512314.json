I WAS UNABLE TO GET OUT OF THE ROAD AND ON TO THE SHOULDER CAUSING SEVERAL CARS TO ALMOST HITTING ME.  WHEN THE JEEP STOPPED I PUT THE SUV IN PARK AND TRIED STARTING ALL IT DID WAS MAKE NOISE.  I THEN STEPPED ON THE BRAKE AND PUT IN NEUTRAL AND TRIED STARTING IT AND IT WOULDN'T START.  I WAITED A FEW MINUTES PUT THE JEEP BACK IN PARK AND TRIED AGAIN AND IT STARTED BUT I'M SCARED TO DRIVE IN NOW.  THIS HAPPENED TO ME 4 TIMES NOW BUT THE OTHER TIMES IT IS WHEN I AM EITHER COMING OFF THE FREEWAY OR ON A CITY STREET NOT GOING THAT FAST AND IN THAT MUCH TRAFFIC.  *TR",
