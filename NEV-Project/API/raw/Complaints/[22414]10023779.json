        "summary": "I HAVE AN ELECTRIC RECLINING SEAT (DRIVER SIDE) IN MY 1995 FORD BRONCO. SUDDENLY AND WITHOUT WARNING THE BACK OF THE SEAT COLLAPSED BACKWARD. I NARROWLY ESCAPED COLLIDING WITH ANOTHER CAR AND THE FREEWAY WALL. I WAS ABLE TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO A SAFE STOP. I TOOK THE BRONCO TO FORD. THEY SAID THE FRAME TWISTED AND BROKE. I AM NOT HUGE! ABOUT 240 LBS. THEY CHARGED ME $350.00 TO FIX IT. I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT AT THE TIME, BUT IN 1997 I WAS REAR ENDED AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO THE SEAT AT THAT TIME. IT COMPLETELY COLLAPSED RENDERING THE AIR-BAG AND SEAT BELT INEFFECTIVE. A NEW SEAT WAS PUT IN AT THAT TIME. SO THIS SEAT IS ONLY ABOUT 6 YEARS OLD. THIS SOUNDS TO ME LIKE A POOR DESIGN AND A SAFETY HAZARD.   *NLM",
