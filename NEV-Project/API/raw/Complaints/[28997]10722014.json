IT STARTED BACK IN NOVEMBER 2014 WHEN THE CAR WOULDN'T START AND IT SAID SERVICE TRANSMISSION, I HAD IT TOWED AND THEY DEALERSHIP SAID IT WAS AN UPDATE ISSUE. THE SECOND TIME THE SERVICE TRANSMISSION LIGHT CAME ONE I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE THEY SAID THAT THE UPDATE DIDN'T TAKE, HOURS LATER TOLD ME IT WAS ALL SET TO GO, WENT TO PICK IT UP AND THE CAR WOULDN'T START, DEALER KEPT IT OVER NIGHT, CALLED NEXT DAY AND TOLD ME THAT THEY COULDN'T RECREATE ISSUE AND I NEEDED TO PICK THE CAR UP UNFIXED! COUPLE DAYS LATER THE SERVICE TRANSMISSION LIGHT CAME BACK, TOOK CAR BACK IN THEY REPLACED THE TCM. THEY CAR STILL SHIFTS HORRILE, THE CAR STARTS SHIFTING GEARS WHILE AT A COMPLETE STOP, AND MOST RECENTLY THE CAR HAS STARTED NOT KNOWING WHAT GEAR ITS IN AND JUST SHIFTS TO NEUTRAL, WHICH IS PRETTY DANGEROUS WHILE DRIVING!!!! DEALER CANNOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT....OVER ALL I HATE DRIVING THE CAR BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL SAFE AT ALL AND I FEEL LIKE I HAVE NO PLACE TO TURN WITH THE DEALER I AM WORKING WITH AS THEY CANNOT FIND THE PROBLEM.",
