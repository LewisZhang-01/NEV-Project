MY VEHICLE IS NO LONGER UNDER BUMPER TO BUMPER AND EMISSIONS WARRANTY BUT I HAVE SAVED RECEIPTS OF THEIR ATTEMPTS TO FIX THE PROBLEM DURING TIME VEHICLE WAS WARRANTED BACK IN 1997. I RECENTLY DISCOVERED THAT THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY HAS FOUND THE EXACT SAME HIGH IDLE PROBLEM WITH THEIR 1998 TO 2000 MODEL RANGERS AND THEY ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN  TSB00-3-5.  WHEN I CALLED MY DEALER TO INQUIRE AND ASK THEM TO INCLUDE  MY '97 RANGER IN THE BULLETIN, THEY WERE EVASIVE AND WOULDN'T HELP.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT MY OPTIONS ARE.   ANY HELP GREATLY APPRECIATED.  THANK YOU.    P.S.  FOR YOUR INFO, THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN CAN BE FOUND AT ( CASE SENSITIVE, PLEASE TYPE EXACTLY)    V8SHO.COM/SHO/TSB00-3-5.HTML    .    *NLM",
