I HAD NO POWER STEERING AT THIS POINT AND HAD TO TOW THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER.  JUST OUT OF WARRANTY AT 37K MILES.  THE STEERING GEAR HAD TO BE REPLACED.  THIS SOUNDS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN THE FORD FUSION MODELS WHICH HAD A RECALL, BUT NO RECALL ON THE HYBRIDS!  I'M THANKFUL IT HAPPENED IN MY DRIVEWAY AND NOT ON THE HIGHWAY.",
