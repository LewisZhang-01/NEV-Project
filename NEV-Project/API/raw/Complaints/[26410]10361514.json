        "summary": "I OWN A 2001 MAZDA 626.  WHILE THE CAR IS 9 YEARS OLD, IT HAS ONLY 72,000 MILES ON IT.  THE PROBLEM I'VE HAD WITH IT IS THAT THE SHIFTER CABLE KEEPS FAILING ON IT.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS AND POTENTIALLY FATAL THING THAT KEEPS HAPPENING.  IT HAS FAILED 3 TIMES IN THE PAST 4 YEARS (2006-2010) AND SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING EVERY 20K-30K MILES.  THE LAST TIME WAS LESS THAN A MONTH AGO AND JUST OVER A YEAR SINCE THE LAST FAILURE.  EACH TIME, THE WARRANTY PERIOD HAS EXPIRED, SO I'M HAVING TO PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS OUT OF POCKET TO GET THIS REPLACED.  I'VE HAD IT DONE AT 3 DIFFERENT PLACES, INCLUDING A MAZDA DEALERSHIP.  THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A  SERIOUS DEFECT IN THE SHIFTER CABLE PARTS/DESIGN, BUT, TO MY KNOWLEDGE, MAZDA HAS YET TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT.  I'VE CONTACTED THEM TO NO AVAIL.  MOST PEOPLE, MYSELF INCLUDED, HAVE CARS FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND WITH A LOT MORE MILEAGE, AND THE SHIFTER CABLE NEVER GOES OUT.  MAZDA NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS DISGRACE.  WHAT CAN I DO TO SEE JUSTICE SERVED? *TR",
