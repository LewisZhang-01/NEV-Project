I HAD JUST REPLACED THE REAR BARRING SO I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS THOSE THAT HAD STARTED TO GO BAD WITHIN 3 MONTHS OF REPLACING THEM.  I TOOK IT TO GET LOOKED AT AND THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THE WHOLE REAR END WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED BEFORE IT SNAPPED IN HALF WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD.  THE CRADLE ARMS AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS ATTACHED TO IT WAS RUSTED, PITTED AND CRUMBLING IN HIS HANDS.  THE FRAME WAS RUSTED COMPLETELY THROUGH.  HE TOLD ME I WAS LUCKY I DIDN'T HIT A POT HOLE BECAUSE THAT IS ABOUT ALL IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN TO BREAK IT.  THE HUBS AND BARRINGS WERE ALSO RUINED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AFTER INSTALLING THEM LESS THAN A YEAR AGO.",
