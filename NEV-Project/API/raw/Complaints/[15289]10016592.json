        "summary": "A MONTH AGO I TOOK MY 2001 CHEVROLET EXT CAB SILVERADO IN FOR SERVICE BECAUSE WHEN I DROVE ACROSS PARKING LOTS WITH MINOR BUMPS I COULD FEEL A RATTLE IN THE STEERING WHEEL. THEY LUBRICATED THE INTERMEDIATE U-JOINT IN THE STEERING COLUMN, THERE WAS GM KIT PROVIDED FOR THE REPAIR. CURRENTLY THE STEERING FEELS LOOSE AND THE VEHICLE DRIFTS WHILE TRAVELING DOWN THE ROAD. I PERSONALLY JACKED UP THE VEHICLE AND ASSESSED FOR LOOSENESS. THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE IN THE STEERING COLUMN. A CLICKING NOISE CAN BE HEARD AND FELT WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL IS TURNED BACK AND FORTH. I WILL BE TAKING THE TRUCK IN FOR SERVICE THIS WEEK. I DON'T THINK THAT GM IS CORRECTLY ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM AND IT MAY LEAD TO ACCIDENTS IN THE FUTURE.  IF A MANUFACTURER PREPARES A KIT FOR REPAIR, IT TELLS ME THAT THEY HAVE HAD NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME TYPE OF PROBLEM. I FEEL GM IS TAKING THE CHEAP WAY OUT BY LUBRICATING VS. THE HIGH COST WAY OR REPLACING THE FAULTY PART.   *NLM",
