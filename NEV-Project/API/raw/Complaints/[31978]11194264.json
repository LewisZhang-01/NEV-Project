        "summary": "WHILE REVERSING MY VEHICLE OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY WITH THE STEERING WHEEL TURNED ALL THE WAY TO THE LEFT, A LOUD SNAPPING SOUND WAS HEARD FROM THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE TIRE. UPON INSPECTION, THE CAUSE OF THE SOUND WAS NOT VISIBLE.     I CONTINUED DRIVING A FEW MILES WHILE LISTENING FOR ANY CHANGES TO THE VEHICLE. A FEW MILES DOWN THE ROAD, I PREPARED TO ENTER THE FREEWAY. AS I DEPRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL, THERE WAS A LOUD GRINDING NOISE EMITTING FROM THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE.     I PULLED THE VEHICLE OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND CALLED TESLA ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE. I ADVISED THEM OF MY OBSERVATIONS AND WAS ISSUED A PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSIS OF DEBRIS IN THE BRAKE CALIPER. I PROCEEDED TO DRIVE MY CAR TO A HIGH-PRESSURE WASHING STATION TO REMOVE THE DEBRIS.     WHILE PARKING AT MY DESTINATION, I NOTICED MY STEERING WHEEL REQUIRED A BIT MORE FORCE TO DURN THE WHEEL; AS I WAS ENCOUNTERING MORE RESISTANCE THAN USUAL WHILE STEERING THE VEHICLE.     I GOT OUT AND LOOKED AT THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE WHEEL WHILE THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TURNED ALL THE WAY TO THE LEFT. I NOTICED A HOLE APPROXIMATELY 2' TALL AND 1' WIDE HAD BEEN WORN THROUGH THE WHEEL WELL LINER BEHIND THE REAR OF THE TIRE. THROUGH THE HOLE, I SAW SOME WIRE COVERINGS AND A PIECE OF THE VEHICLE'S ALUMINUM FRAME. I ALSO OBSERVED THE WHEEL WOULD RUB UP AGAINST THE EXPOSED METAL FRAME WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TURNED.     I CALLED TESLA ROADSIDE AGAIN AND UPDATED THEM OF MY FINDINGS. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE SERVICE CENTER AND SUBSEQUENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH A BROKEN FORE-LINK ON THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE SUSPENSION. THE FORE-LINKS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE VEHICLE WERE REPLACED, AS WELL AS THE WHEEL WELL LINER.",
