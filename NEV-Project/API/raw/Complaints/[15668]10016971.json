ORIGINAL WARRANTY WAS 3 YEARS OR 36,000 MILES WHICH EVER COMES FIRST. VEHICLE HAS BEEN SERVICED BY DEALER SINCE PURCHASE.  THE TRUCK GAVE A HIGH SCREECHING NOISE AND LOSS OF POWER IN THE TRANSMISSION, FORWARD DRIVE GEAR. I PULLED OFF THE FAIRFAX COUNTY PARKWAY IN HERNDON AND PULLED INTO A PARKING LOT. NEXT DAY TRIED TO BACK UP TRUCK AND TRANSMISSION GAVE SCREECHING NOISE AND VEHICLE WOULD NOT MOVE.  IF VEHICLE IS 2, 3 OR 4 YEARS OLD BUT ONLY HAS 36,489 MILES WHY CAN'T GMC PROVIDE RELIEF FOR A VEHICLE DEFECT IN THE TRANSMISSION WHICH IS SAFETY RELATED DUE TO LOSS OF POWER AND MANEUVER ABILITY WHEN IT OCCURRED?  VEHICLE IS AT A GMC DEALER WHICH I DID NOT PURCHASE FROM FOR REPAIRS AS I HAVE HAD IT TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALER FOR REPAIRS. CAN YOU PROVIDE SOME ASSISTANCE WITH GMC ON WARRANTY OR SECRET WARRANTY REPAIRS? *JB",
