BEFORE THE CAR EVEN HAD 30.000 MILES ON IT, THE ALTERNATOR WENT BAD (I WAS INITIALLY TOLD IT WAS A BAD BATTERY, SO IN ADDITION I PURCHASED A NEW BATTERY), THE STEERING WHEEL WAS REPLACED, AND THE DOME LIGHTS WERE REPLACED.  BETWEEN 30,000 AND 50,000 MILES, THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE REGULATOR WENT BAD, THE ENGINE COOLANT SYSTEM CAP LEAKED AND DAMAGED MY BELTS, AND THE INTAKE GASKET IS LEAKING.  WITH A NEW CAR, THIS IS AN UNREASONABLE AMOUNT OF DEFECTS AND I NEEDED TO KNOW HOW TO REPORT THIS CAR AS A SERIOUS HAZARD OR AS A SERIOUS LEMON.",
