TOOK CAR TO DEALERSHIP, FIRST THING THEY DID IS ROTATE AND BALANCE TIRES. DID NOT FIX PROBLEM. I HAVE READ OF NUMEROUS REPORTS OF THIS SAME ISSUE. WHEN WILL FORD STAND UP TO THIS PROBLEM BEFORE IT TAKES SOMEONES LIFE. THE ELECTRONIC STEERING PROBLEMS ARE A SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS ISSUE. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE PURCHASE ANY FORD FOCUS UNTIL THIS POOR SYSTEM IS REPLACED, OR A RECALL IS INSTATED TO FIX THIS SERIOUS ISSUE.",
