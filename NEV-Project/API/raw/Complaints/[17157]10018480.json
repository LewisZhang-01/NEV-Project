I HAVE RELIGIOUSLY HAD MY CAR SERVICED AT THE RECOMMENDED SCHEDULE.  I WAS TOLD AND LED TO BELIEVE THAT THE ENGINE WAS VIRTUALLY MAINTENANCE FREE UP TO 100,000 MILES.  MY CAR HAS 82,000 MILES AND NOW THEY TELL ME THAT I NEED A NEW HEAD GASKET AT NICE COST OF $2800.00.  I'M TIRED OF BEING CHARGED FOR \"SOME LITTLE PROBLEM\" EVERY TIME I BRING IT IN!    *JB",
