        "summary": "TRANSMISSION STARTED TO HAVE HARD SHIFTING, SLIPPING BETWEEN 3RD AND 4TH GEAR. JUMPS VERY HARD WHEN PUT IN REVERSE. THIS PROBLEM ONLY STARTED THREE MONTHS AGO. THE CAR ONLY HAD 73000 MILES ON IT WHEN IT STARED TO ACT WRONG. IT WOULD SLIP BETWEEN 3RD AND FOURTH GEAR WHEN GOING ABOVE 40 MPH AND DO IT ONLY ONE OR TWO TIMES WHEN STARTING TO DRIVE THEN OPERATE NORMALLY UNTIL THE NEXT COLD START. TRUCK HAS MOSTLY HIGHWAY MILES AND JUST STARTED DRIVING CITY ROUTES IN THE PAST TWO YEARS. I SEE SEVERAL POSTED COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS MODEL TRANSMISSION. MAYBE NHTSA SHOULD RECALL IT BEFORE SOMEONE HAS A BAD ACCIDENT DUE TO TRANSMISSION FAILURE.",
