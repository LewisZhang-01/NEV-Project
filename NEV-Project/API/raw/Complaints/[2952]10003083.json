IT LEFT ME STRANDED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH A TRUCK LOAD OF HUNTING GEAR.  OF COURSE IT HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALER.  DIAMLER CHRYSLER COULD CARE LESS THAT IT WAS 9PM AND I HAD NO WAY HOME.  THE DEALER IN ANNAPOLIS REBUILT THE TRANSMISSION - THEY CLAIMED THE TORQUE CONVERTER FAILED. THEY HAD THE VEHICLE FOR A WEEK.  3 DAYS AFTER I GOT THE VEHICLE BACK, THE TRANSMISSION STARTED TO FAIL AGAIN. NOW ITS AT LEESBURG DODGE (VA) AND THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF REBUILDING IT A SECOND TIME.  THIS TRUCK HAS NO TOW HITCHES AND HAS NEVER TOWED A HEAVY LOAD.  IT IS NOT ABUSED BUT JUST FAILED.  THIS IS UNNACCEPTABLE AND IF THINGS ARE NOT MADE RIGHT WITH ME, I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER DODGE AGAIN.",
