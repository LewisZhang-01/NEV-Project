WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION WILL ENTER OVERDRIVE MODE AT APPROXIMATELY 45-50MPH. ONCE THIS OCCURS THE VEHCILE WILL NO LONGER RESPOND TO LIGHT OR MODERATE THROTTLE PRESSURE. IF YOU APPLY A HEAVIER PRESSURE THEN THE VEHICLEE DROPS DOWN INTO PASSING GEAR AND TAKES OFF. THIS PRESENTS A VERY UNSAFE AND HAZARDOUS CONDITION WHEN ATTEMPTING TO ENTER A LIMITED ACCESS HIGHWAY OR PASSING ANOTHER VEHICLE, IN THAT THE VEHICLE POWER AND ACCELERATION IS LOST AT THE PRECISE MOMENT THAT THE TRANSMISSION DROPS INTO OVERDRIVE. THE DEALERS FIX WAS TO REPLACE THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION. UNFORTUNATELY THE NEW TRANSMISSION HAS DEVELOPED THE SAME PROBLEM AFTER ONLY 3,000 MILES. THE NEW TRANSMISSION ALSO DOES NOT SHIFT PROPERLY FROM 1ST TO 2ND GEAR WHEN STARTING UP IN THE MORNING. THE ENGINE REVS AND GAINS RPMS BUT THE TRANSMISSION DOES NOT UPSHIFT UNTIL THE VEHICLE HAS TRAVELLED 4-5 BLOCKS.",
