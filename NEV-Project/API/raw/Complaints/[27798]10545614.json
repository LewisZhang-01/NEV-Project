        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING AT 70 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN MY VEHICLE ESSENTIALLY STALLED.  THE ENGINE STILL APPEARED TO BE RUNNING (MINIMAL RPMS), BUT I COULDN'T ACCELERATE, SO THE SLOWDOWN TO A CRAWL WAS RATHER DRAMATIC. I WAS ABSOLUTELY LUCKY I WAS NOT INJURED AS I WAS NEARLY CLIPPED BY AN 18-WHEELER AS I ATTEMPTED TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY.  THE WRENCH-SHAPED LIGHT CAME ON, WHICH I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE.  I HAD MY VEHICLE TOWED, BUT WHILE WAITING ON THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY MY BATTERY SHORTED OUT.  THE NEAREST FORD DEALERSHIP (WILLIS FORD OF SMYRNA, DELAWARE) WAS NOT ABLE TO GET ANY \"CODES\" FROM THE TEST THEY RUN.  SO ALL THEY ENDED UP DOING WAS REPLACING MY BATTERY.  I PICKED MY CAR UP THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON AND IT SEEMED FINE.  HOWEVER, THE NEXT MORNING (THE FIRST INCIDENT HAPPENED ON THE 4TH, THE SECOND ON THE 6TH), THE SAME THING HAPPENED.  ALBEIT I WAS ONLY DRIVING ABOUT 50MPH.  ONCE AGAIN, THE WRENCH LIGHT CAME ON.  THE FORD DEALERSHIP IN DOVER, DELAWARE (WINNER FORD) ALSO COULD NOT GET THE CODE.  BUT AFTER MY RESEARCH AND EXPLANATIONS, THEY WERE IN ROUGHLY 80% AGREEMENT THAT IT WAS THE THROTTLE BODY, SO WITH MY PERMISSION THEY REPLACED IT.  THAT WAS ON THE 11TH OR 12TH.  THEY HAD KEPT IT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND DROVE IT THEMSELVES TO TRY AND GET THE SITUATION TO REPLICATE, WHICH THEY COULDN'T DO.  SINCE IT HAS BEEN REPLACED, IT HAS NOT HAPPENED.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT OF THIS PROCESS, BUT KNOWING THAT THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION MAKES ME FEEL A LITTLE LESS CRAZY.  *TR",
