THE KIA DEALERSHIP DIAGNOSED THE SAME PROBLEM, REACHED OUT TO KIA TO DISCUSS COVERING THE COSTS, AND KIA TOLD THE DEALERSHIP THAT THEY WOULDN'T. I WAS TOLD EITHER REPLACE THE ENGINE WHICH WITH PARTS AND LABOR WOULD BE AROUND $4,500-$5,000 OR I COULD TRADE IT IN AND GET A FEW HUNDRED FOR IT.    WHY ON EARTH WOULD I BUY ANOTHER KIA IF THEY'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEM WHEN IT TURNS OUT TO BE AN ASSEMBLY DEFECT TO BEGIN WITH. WHAT'S EVEN MORE FRUSTRATING IS THAT THERE IS A ENGINE RECALL ON OPTIMAS AND SPORTAGES WITHIN THE SAME YEAR AS MY FORTE BUT THEY DON'T FEEL THE NEED TO OPEN UP A RECALL.    READING ABOUT IT ONLINE THERE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME (ENGINE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED) PROBLEM BUT KIA STILL WON'T DO A RECALL FOR FORTE MODELS IN THE SAME YEAR RANGE. IF KIA WON'T DO RIGHT BY IT'S CUSTOMERS, I DON'T SEE THE MOTIVATION IN CONTINUING TO GIVE THEM MY BUSINESS.",
