AFTER THE DOOR OPENED I SWERVED LOOSING CONTROL HOWEVER THERE WASN'T AN ON COMING VEHICLE AT THE TIME.  FROM THE FORCE OF THE DOOR SWINGING OPEN BOTH OF THE JOINTS BROKE OFF AND THE SERVICE MAN AT OUR LOCAL DEALER INFORMED US THAT HE SEES MANY OF THESE PROBLEMS ON THE 1994/1995 MODELS.  I HAD ALL OF THE RECALLS DONE TO DATE INCLUDING THE REAR LATCH THAT I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH.  I HAVE ALSO HAD TO REPLACE THE 02 SENSOR.  I FEEL THIS COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE IF THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ON COMING CAR AT THE TIME.  WE WERE VERY LUCKY.  *NLM      **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*734346",
