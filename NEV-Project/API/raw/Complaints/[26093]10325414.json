THIS HAPPENS CONSTANTLY AND IS GETTING WORST.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO BALISE TOYOTA IN WARWICK, RHODE ISLAND TO BE REPAIRED.  THEY STATED IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE POWER STEERING DRIVE BELTS AND THEY REPLACED THEM.  HOWEVER THE VEHICLE CONTINUES TO HAVE EXTREME DIFFICULTY IN STEERING AND IT CONTINUES TO BIND. I BELIEVE THIS IS A THREAT TO MY FAMILIES AND MY SAFETY IF WE CONTINUE TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE. I HAVE CHECK THE WEBSITES ON TOYOTA DEFECTS AND I BELIEVE IT IS A PROBLEM WITH CORROSION OF THE STEERING UNIVERSAL  JOINTS.  *TR",
