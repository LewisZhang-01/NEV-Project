        "summary": "IN DECEMBER 2013 I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL SET AT 60 MPH WHEN VEHICLE COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN. VEHICLE STARTED BACK UP BECAUSE OF THE SPEED I WAS DRIVING. LATER ON MY TRIP HOME I WAS DOING 45 MPH AND VEHICLE SHUT DOWN AND LOSS ALL CONTROL OF VEHICLE. BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO AN AUTOZONE TO SCAN AND SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. IT WAS THE CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSORS. I CHANGED THE SENSORS AND HAD NO PROBLEMS UNTIL 3/20/2014 WHEN THE VEHICLE STARTED SHUTTING DOWN AGAIN. FIRST THOUGHT IT WAS BAD FUEL. TRIED DIFFERENT FUEL STATION AND VEHICLE STILL WOULD SHUT DOWN UNEXPECTED. WHEN VEHICLE SHUTS DOWN YOU LOSE CONTROL OF VEHICLE. VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION FOR THE ROUTE THAT I DRIVE DUE TO A LOT OF CURVES IN THE ROAD. BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO AUTOZONE AGAIN TO SCAN FOR THE PROBLEM AND NOW IT'S THE CRANKSHAFT POSITION SENSOR. CALLED INFINITI TO SEE IF THERE WAS A RECALL BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF COMMENTS ON THIS PROBLEM. INFINITI SAID THERE WAS NO OPEN RECALL. BOUGHT SENSOR AND WILL REPAIR MYSELF BEFORE A SERIOUS INCIDENT OCCURS.  *TR",
