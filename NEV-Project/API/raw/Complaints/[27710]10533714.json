THIS IS THE 2ND TIME THIS SAME PART HAS FAILED ON THIS VEHICLE - IT IS A TINY, SMALL \"POT METAL\"/NYLON PART THAT IS A WEAK LINK IN THIS SUPPOSEDLY OTHERWISE STURDY RIG, AND THE ONLY FIX AFTER ALL THIS TIME OF REPEATED FAILURES IS TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE STEERING COLUMN, RATHER THAN ONLY THE OFFENDING PART, AGAIN.  THIS YEAR, THE PART LASTED FOR FAR LESS TIME THAN THE ORIGINAL PART - FOR ONLY 4 YEARS AND 48,000 MI.  IT IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION WHEN A CAREFUL AND CONSCIENTIOUS DRIVER IS UNABLE TO RELY ON A VEHICLE USED TO TRANSPORT A WHEELCHAIR-BOUND PERSON.  THIS JEEP IS A ONE-OWNER VEHICLE AND IS REGULARLY MAINTAINED AND CARED FOR BY THE DEALERSHIP AND OTHER AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTERS.  (IN 2009, IT TOOK MONTHS TO GET THE PART)  THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR RECALL.  THE THING IS NOT GOING TO EXPLODE AND KILL SOMEONE, BUT LEAVING OCCUPANTS VULNERABLE (WITH NO WARNING) IS STILL A SERIOUS SECURITY ISSUE.  *TR",
