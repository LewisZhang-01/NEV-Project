ON MANY OCCASIONS, PROCEEDING TO BACK OUT OF PARKING SPOTS THE CAR ACCELERATES AND LUNGES ON ITS OWN. IT WILL THEN JERK AND GO DEAD ALWAYS STARTS RIGHT BACK, DISPLAYING A WRENCH LIGHT. SEVERAL TIMES WAITING IN DRIVE THROUGH LINES OR AT TRAFFIC LIGHTS THIS HAS HAPPENED. I ALWAYS FEEL AS IF IT IS DANGEROUS TO PULL IT INTO GEAR IF ANYONE OR ANYTHING IS WITHIN 10 FEET OF ME. THEN THERE ARE THE TIME ON THE ROAD WHEN I SUDDENLY LOSE POWER. I HAVE DISCUSSED THIS PROBLEM WITH THE DEALERSHIP ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND ALL THEY TELL ME IS THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. THIS SEEMS TO BE A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT WILL EVENTUALLY CAUSE HARM TO ONE OR MANY PEOPLE.  *TT",
