A FEW MONTHS AGO, ITS STARTER WENT BAD AND WAS REPLACED.  THIS MORNING, THE DEALER FOUND THAT ITS ENGINE VALVE SEALS WORN OUT AND MUST BE REPLACED (OVER $1000 REPAIR).  I CHECKED THE INTERNET CAR FORUMS AND FOUND THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH 1997 MODEL YEAR 4-CYLINDER TOYOTA CAMRY.  I BELIEVE THAT IT IS A POOR DESIGN AND BUILD PROBLEM.  CUSTOMERS SHOULD NOT BE PAYING A PROBLEM CAUSED BY THE MANUFACTURER'S POOR DESIGN AND BUILD.  ALL 1997 4-CYLINDER CAMRY SHOULD BE RECALLED AND REPAIRED BY TOYOTA.   *NLM",
