THE CAR IS MADE OF NOTHING. THIS HAS BEEN THE WORST CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED. I THINK ALL FORD PRODUCTS ARE BAD AND COST TO MUCH TO FIX WHEN IT IS FORD'S PROBLEM BEFORE THEY EVER COME OUT OF THE FACTORY. EVERYONE I TALK WITH HAS THE SAME TO SAY. I WOULD NOT HAVE A FORD. NOW I HAVE TO GET A NEW CAR AND IT SURE WILL NOT BE ANOTHER FORD.  I ALSO HAVE HAD A WHOLE LOT OF OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR, ITS SO MUCH I CAN NOT LIST ALL.",
