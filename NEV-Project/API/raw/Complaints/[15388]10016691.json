I TOOK MY CAR TO MY MECHANIC, THEY SAID THEY HAVE SEEN 3 MONTO CARLO'S THAT MONTH HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.   I HAVE OWNED NUMEROUS VEHICLES IN MY LIFE AND HAVE NEVER HAD THIS KIND OF PROBLEM.  IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. THEN WHEN DRIVING IT TO MY MECHANIC,  THANK GOD MY SON WAS IN THE CAR WITH ME, AND HELPED ME MUSCLE THE CAR THROUGH THE TURN, OR THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.   ALSO THE GAS GAUGE HAS NEVER GIVEN A ACCURATE READING.  WHEN MY MECHANIC TOLD ME  THEY HAD BEEN SEEING A LOT OF MONTE CARLOS WITH THIS PROBLEM, IT ALERTED ME THAT THERE MUST BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THE POWER STEERING, AND I STARTING CHECKING THE RECALLS,  AND SURE ENOUGH, GM HAS RECALLED 96 - 98'S CHEVROLET LUMINAS, WHICH IS A SISTER CAR TO THE MONTO CARLO, THE ONLY MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO CARS IS THE BODY STYLE COUPE (2 DOOR) TO SEDAN (FOUR DOOR).  THEY HAVE THE SAME MECHANICAL WORKING PARTS.    HOPEFULLY THEY'LL GET THE MONTE CARLO RECALLED SOON BEFORE THERE ARE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.       *JB",
