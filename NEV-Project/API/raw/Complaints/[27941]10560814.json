THERE IS NO CODE TO DEACTIVATE THIS PROBLEM FOR I HAVE RESEARCHED ONLINE & CALLED THE JEEP DEALERSHIP TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE WITHOUT THE COSTLY EXPENSE.  TO EASILY RESOLVE THIS ISSUE, IS TO JUST CUT THE SEAT BELT STRAP OR TAKE OUT THE ENTIRE REAR SEAT WHICH IS A BIG TIME-CONSUMING MESS TO TAKE OUT & PUT BACK IN PLACE JUST TO LOOSEN THE STRAP AS I READ ONLINE.  TO HAVE THE DEALERSHIP DO THE WORK WOULD BE PUTTING OUT MORE $$$$ FOR THE SAME THING AS DOING IT YOURSELF.  THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR THE MIDDLE REAR SEAT BELT IN THE GRAND CHEROKEE AS I HAVE READ ONLINE & NOTHING IS BEING DONE TO CORRECT THIS.  NO ONE CAN SIT IN THE MIDDLE WITHOUT A SEAT BELT BY LAW.  I HAVE 4 GRANDKIDS THAT I TAKE TO SWIM LESSONS OR VISITS AT THE SAME TIME & IF I KNOT IN ANOTHER SEAT BELT STRAPS TO THE JEEP SEAT BELTS THAT IS STILL TAKING A RISKY CHANCE OF ENDANGERING THEIR LIVES BY DOING THIS OR GETTING A TICKET FOR IMPROPER SEAT BELT USAGE.   *TR",
