THREE WEEKS LATER THE LEFT FRONT SPRING BROKE AND SHREDDED THAT TIRE ALSO. IF I HAD BEEN ON THE EXPRESS WAY, I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE HERE TO TELL ABOUT IT.  IN THE PAST FIFTY YEARS I HAVE OWNED 15 CARS AND NEVER HAD A FRONT SPRING BREAK DOWN MUCH LESS TWO IN THREE WEEKS. EVEN THOUGH THE HYUNDAI DEALER,PATRICK OF SCHAUMBURG, REPLACED THESE SPRINGS UNDER WARRANTY, I STILL INCURRED A $200.00 CAR RENTAL BILL. HYUNDAI DOESN'T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT THE CAUSE IS OF THESE SPRING FAILURES AT ONLY 40,600 MILES. ANY HELP AS TO THE CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.  *TR",
