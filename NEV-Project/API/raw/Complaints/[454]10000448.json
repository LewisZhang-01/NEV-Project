SINCE THEN, I'VE HAD THE WHEEL BEARINGS REPLACED TWICE, THE REAR DOOR STOPPED LATCHING AND I HAD TO DRIVE IT TO THE DEALER WITH MY SON HOLDING THE DOOR SHUT, MY ALTERNATOR HAD TO BE REPLACED AND STILL THE LIGHTS GET DIM WHEN I TURN ON THE HEATER, THE PLASTIC AND RUBBER DOOR MOLDING STARTED COMING LOOSE AND FALLING OFF RIGHT AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR, THE BRAKES HAVE NEVER STOPPED SQUEALING, AND NOW MY KEY IS STUCK IN THE IGNITION AND IT WON'T COME OUT.  EVERY TIME I TAKE MY CAR TO A DEALER, THEY ALWAYS SAY THE SAME THING \"OH, THAT IS COMMON WITH THE FORD FOCUS\".  AFTER READING ALL OF THE CONSUMER COMPLAINTS, I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THESE PROBLEMS ARE COMMON WITH THE FORD FOCUS.  I'VE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH THIS CAR AND EXPECT TO EXPERIENCE MANY MORE BECAUSE SO FAR THE TRACK RECORD FOR THE FORD FOCUS IS EXTREMELY POOR.      AFTER READING THE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS, I HOPE FORD IS FORCED INTO RECALLING THE IGNITION CYNLINDER OR SWITCH WHICHEVER IS TO BLAME FOR THE KEY TO BECOMING STUCK IN THE IGNITION AND THE WHEEL NOT LOCKING WHILE THE CAR IS IN PARK.
