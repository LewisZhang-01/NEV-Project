THE DEALER SAID THE VEHICLE IS SHIFTING FINE AND TO BRING IT BACK WHEN IT DOES IT AGAIN. THIS WAS BACK ON 08/19/02 AND NOW I HAVE A CODE 1870 ON THE COMPUTER AND THE TRANSMISSION IS SHOT. I FOUND OUT THE TRANSMISSION IS A 4L60E AND IT IS VERY UNRELIABLE. ALSO I ALREADY HAD TO CHANGE MY WATER PUMP AND ALTERNATOR AND MY GAS GAUGE DOES NOT WORK AND THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS ALSO.    *JB",
