        "summary": "ON 2/13/2008, I TRIED TO OPEN MY PASSENGER SLIDER DOOR WITH THE AUTO BUTTON.  THE DOOR OPENED APPROXIMATELY A FOOT THEN CLOSED ITSELF.  I TRIED THIS A SECOND TIME AND AGAIN IT HAPPENED.  MY HUSBAND THEN TRIED TO OPEN THE DOOR MANUALLY AND THE DOOR WOULD NOT OPEN FURTHER THAN ABOUT A FOOT AGAIN.  MY HUSBAND CHECKED THE DOOR AND UPON INSPECTION NOTICED THAT THE CABLE WAS BROKEN.  WE CALLED TOYOTA AND FOUND THAT AT THE TIME THERE WERE NO RECALLS RELATED TO THIS PROBLEM. THE REPRESENTATIVE STATED TO GO TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALER AND HAVE THEM DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM THEN CALL TO SEE WHAT TOYOTA COULD DO FOR US.  WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE DEALERSHIP,  I INFORMED THE SERVICE TECH BEHIND THE COUNTER THAT I WAS BRINGING IN MY 2004 SIENNA TO HAVE THE SLIDING DOOR CHECKED.  HIS REPLY WAS \"LET ME GUESS, THE CABLE SNAPPED\".  HE THEN PROCEEDED TO TELL US THAT THEY WERE HAVING ALOT OF ISSUES WITH THIS.  THE DEALERSHIP CHECKED MY VEHICLE OVER, CONFIRMED THE CABLE HAD SNAPPED AND STATED THAT IT WOULD COST ROUGHLY $1,600.00.  I TOLD THEM THAT THEIR CUSTOMER RELATIONS MGR. NEEDED TO CONTACT TOYOTA TO SEE WHAT THEY WOULD DO FOR US, AS MY EVERYDAY MECHANIC HAD STATED TO ME THAT FOR A 4 YEAR OLD VEHICLE THIS SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED.  THE TECH CONSULTED WITH HIS MANAGER (WHO NEVER EVEN PICKED UP THE PHONE) RETURNED AND STATED THAT THEY WOULD PAY FOR THE PART AND WE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ROUGHLY $500-600 FOR LABOR.  I AGREED AS I REALLY HAD NO CHOICE.  PLEASE HELP NOT ONLY ME, BUT THE OTHER SIENNA OWNERS GET THIS PROBLEM INTO A RECALL STATUS, AS IF THIS EVER SHUTS ON A CHILD SERIOUS INJURY OR A DEATH MAY OCCUR.  *TR",
