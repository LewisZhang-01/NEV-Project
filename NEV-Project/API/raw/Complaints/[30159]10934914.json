I DROPPED THE JEEP AT THE DEALERSHIP (MALL OF GEORGIA CHRYSLER JEEP IN BUFORD GA) AND RECEIVED A SHUTTLE RIDE HOME. I WAS CALLED A FEW HOURS LATER BY MY ADVISOR [XXX] AND TOLD THAT I NEEDED TO REMOVE THE WINCH, WINCH PLATE, LIGHT BAR, AND LIGHTS ON THE FRONT BUMPER. THE TECH NEEDS TO REMOVE GRILL AND CANNOT WITH THIS EQUIPMENT IN THE WAY. THEY OFFERED TO REMOVE ALL THE EQUIPMENT FOR ME FOR $250. I TOLD THE ADVISOR ([XXX]) THAT THE LETTER RECEIVED IN THE MAIL IS ADAMANT THAT THIS IS TO BE DONE AT NO COST TO THE OWNER. HE TOLD ME THAT IT DID NOT INCLUDE CUSTOM EQUIPMENT. I CALLED FCA, AS MY LETTER EXPLAINED I SHOULD DO IF THE DEALER WAS NOT RESOLVING MY ISSUE. I EXPLAINED THE SITUATION AS I HAVE ABOVE. THE FCA AGENT (I DO NOT HAVE HER NAME, BUT GAVE THEM MY INFO) FIRST INDICATED TO ME THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY CHARGES FOR RECALL REPAIRS, SO SHE CALLED THE DEALER, TALKED TO [XXX], AND CAME BACK TO MY LINE TELLING ME EXACTLY WHAT [XXX] HAD TOLD ME THAT A CHARGE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO REMOVE THE CUSTOM EQUIPMENT SO THEY CAN REPAIR THIS VEHICLE.    SHOULD THERE EVER BE A REASON FOR CHARGING A CUSTOMER FOR A RECALL REPAIR, IN A SAFETY RECALL SITUATION SUCH AS THIS?  *TR",
