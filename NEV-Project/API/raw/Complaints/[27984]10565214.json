THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NO FIX YET AVAILABLE....OBVIOUSLY VERY DISAPPOINTED AND WORRIED ABOUT HOW LONG I HAVE BEEN DRIVING WITH POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS PART/DEFECT THAT COULD CAUSE LOSS OF CONTROL AND WRECK. I THINK NHTSA SHOULD FORCE THE ISSUE WITH TOYOTA NOW IT HAS BEEN TOO LONG!. LOCAL DEALER  ADVISED ME WHAT SOUND, LOUD RATTLING IN BACK OF VEHICLE TO LISTEN FOR....REALLY UNBELIEVABLE THE DELAY.  *TR",
