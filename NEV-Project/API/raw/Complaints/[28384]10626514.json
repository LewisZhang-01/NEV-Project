AFTER A MINUTE OR SO I LOOKED DOWN AND WAS GOING 75 AND ACCELERATING. I TAPPED THE BREAK WHICH HAD NO EFFECT. I TAPPED THE BREAK SEVERAL MORE TIME BUT THE TRUCK KEPT ACCELERATING. I PUSHED THE OFF BUTTON SEVERAL TIMES WHILE CONTINUING TO PUMP THE BREAK. THE CRUISE CONTROL FINALLY WENT OFF. SEVERAL MILES DOWN THE ROAD I TRIED TO USE THE CRUISE CONTROL AGAIN WITH THE SAME RESULTS. MY TRUCK IS A 4.2L V6 AND HAS HAD THE RECALL TAKEN CARE OF SEVERAL YEARS AGO. THIS APPEARS TO HAVE HAPPENED TO SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE AND COULD HAVE HAD A DISASTROUS OUTCOME.   *TR",
