VA., I NOTICED A VIBRATION IN THE CAR AND THOUGHT IT WAS A PATCH OF ROUGH ROAD AND IMMEDIATELY, THERE WAS A LOAD BANG AND AS I LOOKED IN MY REAR VIEW MIRROR, I NOTICED BLACK STRIPS FLYING BEHIND ME.  THE CAR BECAME SLUGGISH AND WAS PULLING TO THE RIGHT.  I IMMEDIATELY PULLED UNTO THE SHOULDER AND STOPPED.  I CHECKED THE RIGHT REAR TIRE AND SAW ALL THE THREAD WAS GONE AND ONLY THE BELT REMAINED AND THE TIRE WAS STILL INFLATED.  I CALLED FOR A TOW COMPANY AND THE DRIVER SHOWED ME THAT ALL THE ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS AND THE REAR BUMPER AND TIRE WELL WERE DESTROYED.  I WAS TOWED TO A GM DEALER IN BECKLEY AND THEY SPLICED THE WIRES FOR A TEMPORARY FIX  AND REPLACED THE TIRES SO I COULD GET HOME.  ONCE HOME, I HAD MY GM DEALER ORDER THE PARTS NEEDED TO FIX THE ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS.  I ALSO HAS A COLLISION REPAIR SHOP FIX THE DAMAGE TO THE EXTERIOR OF THE CAR.  *TR",
