I WAS FIGHTING TO STOP THE CAR WITH THE BRAKE BUT FAILED TO DO SO AS THE CAR WAS ACCELARATING AT HIGH SPEEDS ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY. I HAD GOT THE CAR DOWN FROM 50MPH TO 15 MPH. AT THIS POINT TURNED ON MY HAZARDOUS LIGHTS AND PULLED OVER TO THE SHOULDER. AT 15 MPH I SAFELY SHUT MY CAR OFF AS I WAS UNABLE TO COMPLETELY STOP. AFTER 30 SECONDS, I TURN MY CAR BACK ON AND SEE THAT THE CAR IS HITTIG REDLINE OF 7000 RPMS IN PARK MODE. I SHUT MY CAR DOWN ONCE MORE AND WAIT ANOTHER MINUTE. I START THE CAR AND THE CAR IS BACK TO NORMAL. I AM BEING TOLD BY MANY PEOPLE IN MY CAR'S INTERNET FORUM THAT THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING TO MANY PEOPLE AND IT IS A FAULTY THROTTLE PEDAL. THE PEDAL HAS A HEATING ELEMENT THAT HAS FAILED DUE TO THE RECENT EXTREMLY COLD WEATHER.",
