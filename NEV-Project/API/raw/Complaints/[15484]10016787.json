FIRST, I HAD PROBLEMS STARTING THE VEHICLE AND IT WAS LATER DETERMINED THAT IT WAS THE FUEL PUMP. THEN THEY HAD TO REPLACE THE CLUTCH BEARING BECAUSE OF SOME NOISE WHILE SHIFTING. THEN THEY HAD TO REPLACE THE CAM SENSOR AS THE VEHICLE DID NOT START ONE DAY. THE VEHICLE CONSTANTLY LOSES OIL AND ONE TIME IT WAS BONE DRY AFTER 3,500 MILES. THIS SEEMS LIKE A CONSTANT PROBLEM FOR THIS MODEL BASED ON PREVIOUS COMPLAINTS. ALL IN ALL, POOR MANUFACTURING OF THE ENGINE COMPONENTS. AFTER THE FLOOR MAT RECALL, THEY REPLACED THE FLOOR MATS AND SECURED IT TO THE CARPET. NOW, THE CARPET GETS CAUGHT ON THE CLUTCH PEDAL, SO I HAVE TO SHIFT THE FLOOR MATS ALL THE TIME.",
