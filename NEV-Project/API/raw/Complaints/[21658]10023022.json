THE STARTER CRANKS THE ENGINE, BUT THE ENGINE WILL NOT START.  ON THE FIRST INCIDENT THE \"QUICK FIX\" WORKED.  THAT IS TURN THE IGNITION SWITCH ON FOR 15 MINUTES THEN TRY AGAIN.  THE CAR WAS DRIVEN TO DEALER BUT NO PROBLEM FOUND. THE LAST THREE TIMES THE CAR WAS TOWED TO DEALER.  ALL THREE TIMES NO PROBLEM FOUND.  THE IGNITION SWITCH WAS REPLACED ON THE SECOND OCCASION, THE CRANK SENSOR WAS REPLACED ON THE THIRD, NOTHING REPLACED ON FOURTH.  DEALER SAYS THEY UNDERSTAND OUR CONCERN.   *NLM",
