        "summary": "PURCHASED USED EXPEDITION IN LATE FEB, 2003. I IMMEDIATELY NOTICED EXTREMELY SENSITIVE STEERING. SLIGHT INPUT, ESPECIALLY AT HIGHWAY SPEED IN RAIN OR WIND, CAUSED LARGE CHANGES IN VEHICLE DIRECTION. LOWER FRONT TIRE PRESSURE, NECONNECTING REAR STAB BAR, FE ALIGNMENT, AND NEW SHOCKS HAVE HELPED THE PROBLEM BUT IT IS STILL WAY TOUCHIER THAN IT SHOULD BE. FORD DEFINITELY HAS A PROBLEM BUILT INTO THIS VEHICLE MODEL. I HAVE OVER 40 YEARS DRIVING EXPERIENCE IN ALL TYPES OF VEHICLES AND HAVE SEEN NOTHING LIKE THIS. I ASSUME IT IS INHERENT IN THE VARIABLE ASSIST POWER STEERING.   *NLM",
