I AM HAVING A PROBLEM WHICH SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE THIS WITH MY CLASS A, 2000 WINNEBAGO HORIZON. ONE OF THE REAR BODY MOUNTS HAS RIPPED OFF THE FRAME, AND HAS BEEN REWELDED TWICE.  STRUCTURAL PIECES WHICH RUN PERPENDICULAR AND PARALLEL TO THE FRAME HAVE SHEARED AND ARE CRACKED.  BODY PANELS HAVE COLLAPSED WHICH HAVE ALLOWED CARBON MONOXIDE FUMES INTO THE COACH.  THE COACH HAS BEEN ATTENDED TO SIX TIMES FOR THIS PROBLEM INCLUDING ONCE AT THE WINNEBAGO FACTORY IN FORREST CITY, IA, WHERE I WAS ASSURED EVERY THING WAS FINE.  THE BODY MOUNT RIPPED OFF THE FRAME 675 MILES DOWN THE ROAD.  SINCE THEN TWO WINNEBAGO DEALERS HAVE LOOKED AT THE PROBLEM AND HAVE SAID THEY CANNOT REPAIR THE DAMAGE.      I FEEL THIS PROBLEM SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED, BECAUSE SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUES ARE AT HAND.                                  FORREST CITY,",
