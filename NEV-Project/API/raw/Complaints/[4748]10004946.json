A STATE TROOPER AIDED US IN PUTTING THE FIRE OUT AND WE HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED OFF OF THE INTERSTATE.  UPON OUR RETURN HOME THAT EVENING WE DISCOVERED A DAIMLER CHRYSLER RECALL NOTICE (RECALL: B06) IN THE MAIL STATING THAT A DEFECT IN THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD MAY RESULT IN AND UNDERHOOD FIRE.  DAIMLER CHRYSLER HAS SINCE INFORMED US THAT BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS OVER 3 YEARS OLD THEY WILL NOT REIMBURSE US FOR THE COSTS OF REPAIR OR PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION AS TO HOW OR WHY THE FIRE OCURRED.",
