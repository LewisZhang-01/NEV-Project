        "summary": "THE BRAKES ON TOYOTA CAMRY LE MODELS ARE NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.  IN EACH OF THREE DIFFERENT CAMRY CARS THAT I HAVE OWNED (1996,2000, AND 2001) THE BRAKES MAKE A RUMBLING SOUND WHEN SLOWING DOWN FROM A SPEED OVER 50 MILES AN HOUR.  FURTHERMORE,  ON MY 2001 CAMRY THE ABS LIGHT CAME ON DURING USE ON ICY ROADS, I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER WHO SAID THAT THIS HAPPENS AND THAT HE HAD FIVE OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE VERY SAME THING THAT DAY.  HE ATTRIBUTED THIS TO ONE OF THE SENSORS \"STICKING\", AND THAT ALL I HAD TO DO IS TURN THE CAR OFF AND LET IT \"COOL \"  DOWN AND THE LIGHT WOULD GO OFF.  THIS IS TRUE, THIS DID HAPPEN, BUT WHAT GOOD ARE ABS BRAKES IF THEY MALFUNCTION ON THE VERY ICY ROADS THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT YOU FROM?  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF A SENSOR IS \"STICKING\"  THE SENSOR SHOULD BE REPLACED AND THAT THE CAR SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE ALLOWED TO \"COOL DOWN\" ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS HAPPENED IN THE MIDDLE OF A PARKWAY ON ICY ROAD CONDITIONS.  ALSO, DURING THE TIME THE ABS LIGHT WAS ON ONE OF THE WHEELS BRAKES LOCKED PREVENTING THE WHEEL FROM SPINNING FURTHER CAUSING A MORE DANGEROUS SITUATION.",
