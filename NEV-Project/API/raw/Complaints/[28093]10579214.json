        "summary": "PARKING MY PRIUS, MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE PEDAL, I HIT A VERY SMALL PATCH OF BLACK ICE WITH THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL. THE CAR SLANTED BRIEFLY TO THE LEFT--THEN THERE WAS A SUDDEN SURGE OF ENGINE POWER.  THE CAR RUSHED OVER A MOUND OF ICE AND SNOW, JUMPED THE CURB, RUSHED FORWARD BETWEEN A WALL AND A TREE, NARROWLY MISSING IT, AND CRASHED INTO A PARKED TOYOTA TRUCK FACING OUTWARD FROM THE CURB.  MY PRIUS HIT THE HEAVY TRUCK WITH ENOUGH FORCE TO KNOCK IT SIX FEET FOR THEIR NORTH AND THREE FEET TO THE WEST.  AFTER IMPACT, THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO MAKE A LOT OF NOISE, A SOUND I'VE NEVER HEARD BEFORE IN SEVEN YEARS OF DRIVING THE CAR. IT WAS ATTEMPTING TO SURGE PAST THE TRUCK, WHICH I BELIEVE CAUSED THE MOST DAMAGE TO THE FRONT LEFT BUMPER OF THE CAR.  I WAS STUNNED AND DIDN'T THINK TO TURN OFF THE IGNITION BEFORE IT QUIT ON ITS OWN AFTER PERHAPS TEN SECONDS.  THE BODY WAS SHEARED BACK, STRIPS OF BLUE PAINT HANGING IN SHREDS.  I CRAWLED OUT THE PASSENGER SIDE UNHURT.  (THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.)    *JS",
