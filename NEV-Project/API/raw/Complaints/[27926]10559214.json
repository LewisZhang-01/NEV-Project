THIS ALSO OCCURRED WHEN I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE ACCELERATOR GOING DOWN A HILL...HIGH RPM (34-400) WITHOUT DECREASE IN SPEED. SUBARU OF MANCHESTER DETERMINED TRANSMISSION CAME FROM MANUFACTURER WITH OVERFILLED FLUID CAUSING HESITANCY AND LAG. REPAIRED AND RESET. ON 12/28/13, MY VEHICLE WOULD NOT ACCELERATE WHILE TRAVELLING AT 60MPH ON A HIGHWAY SO I COULD AVOID BEING HIT BY ANOTHER VEHICLE WHO WAS DRIFTING TOWARDS MY RIGHT SIDE AS IT ATTEMPTED TO GET ON THE HIGHWAY. I PRESSED THE ACCELERATOR CONTINUOUSLY AND THEN TO THE FLOOR; RPM'S REVVED TO 5400; LOUD AIRPLANE TYPE SOUND; WITH NO ACCELERATION. SUBARU OF MANCHESTER HAS SINCE DETERMINED THE TRANSMISSION NEEDED AN UPDATE AND RESET OF THE TRANSMISSION SETTINGS. THEY ALSO FOUND A LEAK BETWEEN THE TRANSMISSION AND THE ENGINE WHICH THEY STATE CAME FROM THE MANUFACTURER. THEY STATED THE POWER TRAIN IS FINE. I WILL PICK MY VEHICLE UP FROM THIS REPAIR WITHIN THE NEXT 24 HOURS AND WILL SEE IF THAT WAS IN FACT THE ISSUE.  *TR",
