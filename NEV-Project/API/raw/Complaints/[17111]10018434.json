THE FIRST, ON THE RIGHT FRONT WHEEL IN JANUARY 2001, DID NOT POSE A SAFETY HAZARD AS IT OCCURRED WHILE THE CAR WAS PARKED IN A GARAGE.  HOWEVER, THE 2ND, ONLY THREE MONTHS AFTER THE FIRST, OCCURRED ON A DIFFERENT WHEEL (RIGHT REAR) AT 60 MPH IN THE MIDDLE LANE OF A CONGESTED PORTION OF I-95 NEAR MILFORD, CT.  THE LATTER CLEARLY POSED A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD TO US, AND TO ALL OTHER VEHICLES ON THIS HEAVILY-TRAFFICKED INTERSTATE.   I DID NOT REPORT THE FIRST BLOWOUT, BELIEVING THAT PERHAPS I HAD HIT SOMETHING ON THE ROAD.  BUT THE SECOND BLOWOUT OF SAME BRAND/VINTAGE TIRE, THIS TIME ON REAR RIGHT SIDE, INDICATES A LIKELY SAFETY DEFECT IN THIS EXPENSIVE MICHELIN TIRE.     *NLM",
