LEFT IT THERE FOR 2 DAYS AND THEY STILL COULD NOT FIND PROBLEM.  WHEN I STOP THE CAR AND OPEN THE DOOR, THEN THE WINDOWS AND DOOR LOCKS WILL OPERATE.  WHEN I START DRIVING AGAIN, THEY ARE \"DEAD\" ONCE MORE AND WILL NOT OPEN OR CLOSE.  I CANNOT GET  THEM TO OPERATE UNLESS I STOP THE CAR AND OPEN THE DOOR FIRST.  WHEN I CLOSE THE DOOR, THEY ARE OKAY UNTIL I START DRIVING AGAIN.  VERY DANGEROUS AND I CAN'T GO THROUGH A DRIVE THROUGH  BANK, ETC.   OR IF I JUST WANT TO OPEN THE WINDOWS WHILE I'M DRIVING, I CAN'T.  IF IT STARTS TO RAIN, I CAN'T CLOSE THE WINDOWS UNLESS I STOP THE CAR. *TR",
