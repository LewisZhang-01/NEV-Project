I WAS ADVISED BY FORD THAT I NEED TO REPLACE THE STRUT AND TIRE.  I HAVE ABOUT 67,000 MILES ON MY VEHICLE. I WAS ALSO INFORMED BY FORD THAT THIS PART IS NOT COVERED UNDER MY WARRANTY, AND MY MECHANIC FOUND THAT THERE ARE NO RECALLS.  MY MECHANIC ADVISED ME THAT HE IS SEEING MORE AND MORE OF THIS PROBLEM.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOULD HAVE BROKEN BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  I NORMALLY DRIVE ON THE HIGHWAY AND BELIEVE THAT IF I HAD BEEN DRIVING TOO OR FROM WORK, I WOULD HAVE BEEN INJURED.*AK",
