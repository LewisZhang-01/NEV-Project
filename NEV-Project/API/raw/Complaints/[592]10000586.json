WHEN I STOPPED TO PUT AIR INTO THE TIRE, IT WAS TOTALLY MISHAPED WITH NUMEROUS BUBBLES IN THE RUBBER. COULD FIND NO APPARENT REASON FOR THE FLAT, AND COULD STILL HEAR AIR ESCAPING THROUGH THE TIRE. MY VEHICLE WAS ASSEMBLED IN MEXICO AT THE PLANT THAT IS INVOLVED IN THE RECALLS. THE RECALL COVERS TIRES FROM CARS ASSEMBLED IN THAT PLANT IN APRIL AND MAY OF 2000. MY CAR WAS ASSEMBLED THERE IN AUGUST OF 2000. I BELIEVE THAT THE RECALL SHOULD POSSIBLY BE EXTENDED TO A LARGER TIME FRAME. I AM GOING TO HAVE ALL OF MY TIRES INSPECTED.",
