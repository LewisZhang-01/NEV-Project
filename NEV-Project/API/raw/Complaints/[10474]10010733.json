HAD TRUCK TOWED TO DEALER, THEY INFORMED ME THAT RIGHT TIE ROD NEEDED TO BE  REPLACED TOO ALONG WITH THE LOWER BALL JOINTS AND IDLER ARM. I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY JUST 20 MINUTES BEFORE. I WAS LUCKY. SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME HE HAS NEEDED TO REPLACE THEM AFTER 15000.   FROM THE FACTORY THERE ARE NO GREASE FITTING FOR LUBRICATION.   ALSO NONE ON REPLACEMENTS.  PLEASE CALL OR E-MAIL WITH ANY QUESTIONS, THANK YOU.   *NLM",
