WHEN I PUT THE VEHICLE IN REVERSE, IT IMMEDIATELY STARTED SPEEDING BACKWARDS. WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKES WITH ALL THE FORCE I COULD MUSTER, IT FAILED TO STOP THE VEHICLE. THE TIRES WERE SQUEALING & BLACK TIRE MARKS WERE LEFT ON THE PAVEMENT. MY VEHICLE STOPPED WHEN I SLAMMED INTO THE FRONT END OF A PARKED CAR WHICH WAS NEXT TO A GAS PUMP WITH THE DRIVER INSIDE. FORTUNATELY NOBODY WAS HURT. NO POLICE REPORT WAS FILED BUT MY INSURANCE COMPANY WAS CALLED IMMEDIATELY TO REPORT IT.    \"TAKATA RECALL\"  I WENT TO THE LOCAL JEEP DEALERSHIP (BLUEBONNET JEEP IN NEW BRAUNFELS,TX.) WITH THE RECALL NOTICE IN HAND. THE EMPLOYEE IN THE DRIVE-UP SERVICE LANE  CALLED THE OFFICE TO VERIFY IF PART WAS IN STOCK. IT WAS NOT. SHE MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR 2 WEEKS FROM THAT DATE. I RETURNED WITH MY VEHICLE ON MY SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT DATE & WAS NOTIFIED BY A DIFFERENT EMPLOYEE THAT PART(S) WERE STILL NOT AVAILABLE & WAS TOLD THAT AN INDIVIDUAL NEEDED TO INSPECT MY VEHICLE FIRST BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHEN THE INSPECTOR WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO DO IT. I TOLD THAT EMPLOYEE THAT THEY WEREN'T SERIOUS ABOUT REPLACING THE PART(S) NEEDED. SO I GOT BACK IN MY CAR & DROVE HOME.",
