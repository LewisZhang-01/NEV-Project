UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, THE ENGINE WAS NOTED TO BE CANTED, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ATTACH THE NEW WATER PUMP. IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE ENGINE MOUNT BOLTS (TOTAL OF 4 ON ONE SIDE) HAD ALL BROKEN OFF, CAUSING THE ENGINE TO TILT. THE REPAIR WAS $2000 AND WHEN I CALLED BMW USA, THEY SAID THAT THERE WOULD BE NO COMPENSATION BACK TO ME, AND THAT THE BROKEN BOLTS WERE SECONDARY TO THE CAR HAVING 90,000 MILES. CHANGING BOLTS IS NOT A NORMAL WEAR AND REPLACEMENT ITEM, AND THE CAR HAS NEVER BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT. OUR VEHICLES ARE GENTLY DRIVEN, AND NEVER GO OFF ROAD, SO I AM MYSTIFIED HOW THIS HAPPENED.  *TR",
