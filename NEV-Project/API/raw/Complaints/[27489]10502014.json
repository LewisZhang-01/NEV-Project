BEING WINTER, COLD AND FROSTY, THIS IS A SEVERE SAFETY ISSUE.  WITH NO DEFROSTER IT IS VERY HARD TO SEE, AND ITS VERY COLD. IT COSTS AROUND 1200 DOLLARS TO GET IT FIXED.  EVEN IF IT IS FIXED I AS TOLD THE WAY THAT THEY MADE THE TORRENT THAT IT WILL JUST BREAK AGAIN.  I DO NOT HAVE THAT KIND OF CASH JUST LAYING AROUND.  IT SHOULD BE RECALLED BUT GM IS TO CHEAP.  THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING.  I DRIVE ALONG WAYS AND ITS DANGEROUS NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE.  *TR",
