IF YOU DO RESEARCH INTO THIS MATTER ON THE INTERNET OR BY CALLING THE VOLVO DEALERSHIPS, YOU WILL FIND THIS PROBLEM OCCURS VERY FREQUENTLY IN THESE CARS. WHEN THE ABS LIGHT IS ON THERE IS NO ANTI-LOCK BRAKES, AND THIS CAN CAUSE THE BRAKES TO LOCK UP DURING HARD BRAKING APPLICATIONS, AND EASILY ON MOIST OR WET ROADS. AS A MAJOR SAFETY FEATURE ON THESE CARS AND ESPECIALLY A VOLVO, WHO IS KNOWN FOR THEIR SAFE AUTOMOBILES THIS CONTROL MODULE FAILS VERY OFTEN AND CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT IF BRAKES LOCK UP IN A PANIC STOP.
