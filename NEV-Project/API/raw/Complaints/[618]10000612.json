THE CAR HAS LESS THAN 5000 MILES ON IT AND IT HAS SPENT SOME 10 DAYS AT THE REPAIR SHOP.  DEFECTS HAVE INCLUDED A TRANSMISSION THAT WOULD DISENGAGE, HEATED SEATS THAT WOULD NOT TURN OFF, A/C AND SIDE MIRRORS THAT WOULD NOT WORK, A MODULE HAD TO BE REPLACED, THE CAR HAD TO BE ALIGNED, THE FRONT SPOILER FELL OFF, A SPEAKER HAD TO BE REPLACED, PART OF THE TRIM ON THE BACK WAS FALLING OFF, THE MEMORY SETTINGS ON THE DRIVER'S SEAT WERE NOT WORKING, AND THE SUN ROOF WAS RATTLING. THE SALES DEPARTMENT HAS RESPONDED TO ALL MY CALLS BY SAYING THAT I NEED TO TALK TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OR TO VW CORPORATE DIRECTLY.  I HAVE DONE BOTH, WHEN I CALLED VW CORPORATE THEY RESPONDED THAT AS LONG AS THE CAR WAS DRIVEABLE THEY WOULD COVER IT UNDER WARRANTY AND WOULD NOT REPLACE THE CAR.  THEY OFFERED ME A LUBE JOB AS A SETTLEMENT!",
