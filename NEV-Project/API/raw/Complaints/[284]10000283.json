        "summary": "I AM A PROFESSIONAL DRIVER WITH OVER 1 MIL ACIDENT FREE MILES. EVERY YEAR THE HEADLIGHTS GET AIMED WORSE, THE TECHNOLOGY GETS BRIGHTER AND SOMETIMES WIDER DISPERSION (BLINDING) AND MORE DRIVERS DRIVE FULLTIME WITH FOG LIGHTS (NON-LENTICULAR LENS). MANUFACTURERS ARE ENCOURAGING THIS PROCESS WITH THE MANUFACTURE OF AUTOS WITH BIG FOG LIGHTS AND FAILING TO LABEL THEM WITH RESTRICTIVE USE WARNINGS.  IN ADDITION, THEIR ADVERTISING ALWAYS SHOWS VEHICLES WITH THESE LIGHTS ON IN THEIR ADVERTISMENTS. BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY  I AM FORCED TO BLOCK OUT THEIR LIGHTS (AT THE RATE OF ABOUT ONE IN TWENTY-FIVE) WITH MY HAND, AND THEREFORE WILL HAVE NO OPPORTUNITY TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT IF THEY CROSS THE CENTER LINE SINCE I CANNOT SEE THEM.  POLICE IN EVERY STATE MUST BE TOLD TO ENFORCE EXISTING LAWS AGAINST FULL-TIME FOG LIGHTS AND MUST REGULATE THE BRIGHTNESS AND AIM OF HEADLIGHTS. THE PROBLEM HAS BECOME EPIDEMIC.",
