THIS CLOG IS THE RESULT OF SOME MATERIAL USED IN THE FUEL TANKS OF '99, '00 AND '01 FORD FOCUS. FORD IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND THE STALLING SYMPTOM IN AN SSB ISSUED TO ALL FORD DEALERS SERVICE CENTERS. THE REPAIR IS TO REPLACE THE FUEL PUMP AND CLEAN THE TANK AT AN EXPENSE OF $500-$1000+ TO THE OWNERS. THIS MATTER HAS BEEN AN ISSUE AND DISCUSSED BY THOUSANDS OF FOCUS OWNERS AROUND THE COUNTRY ON SUCH SITES AS HTTP://WWW.FOCALJET.COM AND FOCUS FORUMS ON HTTP://WWW.YAHOO.COM.  SINCE FORD ONLY ISSUED AN SSB AND NOT A RECALL, WE FEEL THIS IS OF GREAT SAFETY CONCERNS AS IT CAN AND HAS RESULTED IN ACCIDENTS.   *NLM",
