FORD NOT VERY CONCERNED WITH IT AND BEING VERY ELUSIVE ABOUT WHATS WRONG. I CAN NOT GET AN ANSWER JUST KEEP TELLING ME THEY ARE FIXING IT, AFTER THEY FIXED IT IT BROKE DOWN ON THEM ON THE TEST DRIVE, AND STILL NOT WILLING TO TELL ME WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO TRUCK OTHER THAN DONT WORRY ABOUT IT ITS UNDER WARRANTY. I GUESS IT IS NOT A CONCERN TO THEM AS LONG THEIR FAIMLY IS NOT IN FRONT OF ME WHEN I CANT STOP VEHICLE DUE TO REASONS THEY DONT WANT TO TALK ABOUT. ALSO ASKED TO TALK TO OWNER OF DEALERSHIP BUT HE IS UNAVAILABLE TO EVEN RETURN A CALL. I BELIVE THIS TO BE A VERY SERIOUS CONCERN AS THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE, IT IS NOT A GOOD FELLING WHEN IT SHUTS DOWN AND YOU KNOW THAT SAFE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE IS NOT THERE. FORD DEALER SAYS ITS THE FUEL FREEZING UP I DONT AGREE I HAVE BEEN USING WINTERIZED FUEL AND ADDING HOWES ANTI-GEL FORMULA TO TANK AT FILL-UPS.
