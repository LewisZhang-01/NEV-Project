VEHICLE WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY, TOOK TO DODGE DEALER AND THEY REPLACED HOSES AND CLAMPS, 1 MONTH LATER LEAKING AGAIN AND THEY STATED THAT IT WAS PROBABLY A BAD PART.  THEY REPLACED THEM AGAIN.  1 YEAR LATER PROBLEM RETURNS AND NOW THEY WANT TO CHARGE ME TO REPLACE THE HOSES, THE REASON THIS HAPPENED ACCORDING TO THEM WAS THE HOSE CLAMPS THEY USED.  NOW THEY HAVE CHANGED THE CLAMPS, THIS SHOULD NOT BE MY RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY FOR SINCE THEY ARE CHANGING A MANUFACTURER'S PART.  THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL.  *JB",
