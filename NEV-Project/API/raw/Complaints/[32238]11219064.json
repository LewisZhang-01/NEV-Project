        "summary": "I HAVE A 2016 CHEVROLET MALIBU WITH ROUGHLY 50,000 MILES ON IT.  FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR NOW, IT IS NO LONGER RECOGNIZING WHEN THE CAR IS PLACED IN PARK.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE INTO MY LOCAL CHEVY DEALER (WHERE WE HAVE ALL OIL CHANGES/WORK DONE ON THE VEHICLE) AND THEY STATED THE SHIFTER ASSEMBLY NEEDS REPLACING.  I AM QUITE UPSET OVER THIS AS THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS OF THIS HAPPENING TO INDIVIDUALS AND GM IS NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.  I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO REPLACE A SHIFTER ASSEMBLY IN THIS NEW OF A CAR AND ESPECIALLY A CAR THAT HAS BEEN WELL TAKEN CARE OF.  I HAVE BEEN QUOTED $1,000 TO REPLACE THE SHIFTER ASSEMBLY.  I HAVE MAINTAINED MY VEHICLE DOING ALL THE NECESSARY WORK/OIL CHANGES AND ALL RECOMMENDED MAINTENANCE.  ONCE THE VEHICLE IS IN PARK AND YOU GO TO SHUT THE VEHICLE OFF, AN ALARM DINGS AND DISPLAYS A MESSAGE SAYING \"SHIFT TO PARK.\"  THE VEHICLE IS IN PARK, YOU CAN REMOVE YOUR FOOT FROM THE BRAKE AND IT DOES NOT ROLL.  YOU CAN NOT WALK AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE BECAUSE THE BATTERY WILL THEN DRAIN.  NORMALLY, VEHICLE HAS TO BE RESTARTED AND PLACED IN DRIVE THEN SHIFT BACK TO PARK IN ORDER FOR IT TO GO OFF.  THIS IS HAPPENING CONSISTENTLY NOW.  THIS COULD BECOME EVEN A GREATER ISSUE THAN GM IS REALIZING AS IF YOU DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THE MESSAGE, YOUR CAR CAN REMAIN ON AND INDIVIDUALS COULD DIE FROM CARBON MONOXIDE.  THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT GM & CHEVY NEEDS TO ADDRESS SOONER THAN LATER.",
