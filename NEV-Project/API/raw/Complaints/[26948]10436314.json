THE VEHICLE THEN BACK UP FROM THE CONCUSSION AND ACCELERATED ONCE AGAIN CAUSING ME TO CRASH TWICE.  I FINALLY CAME TO MY SENSES AND SHUT THE VEHICLE OFF.  I HAD BEEN NOTICING THE BRAKES FEELING STRANGE PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT.  THIS CAUSED $6,400 IN DAMAGE.  TOYOTA WAS ALERTED, HAD THE VEHICLE INSPECTED AND CLAIM IT REVEALED NO EVIDENCE OF ANY SORT OF MALFUNCTION OR DEFECT.  IN MY HEART, I KNOW THAT IS NOT TRUE. THIS WAS A VERY FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE AND I DREAD THIS HAPPENING AGAIN.  *TR",
