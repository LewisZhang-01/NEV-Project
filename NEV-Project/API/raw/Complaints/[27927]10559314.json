        "summary": "THE DRL (DAYLIGHT RUNNING LIGHTS) BULBS WERE DESIGNED TO CLOSE TO THE LENS COVER AND THE BULB IS TO HOT. IT BURNT / MELTED THE LENS ON BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT HEADLIGHTS. IT LEAVES A DARK SPOT ( APPROX 2.5 INCHES IN DIAMETER) . IT HAPPENED WHEN THE OUTSIDE TEMP WAS HOT (GREATER THAN 105 DEG F) AND THE RUNNING LIGHTS WERE ON (THEY COME ON AUTOMATICALLY WHEN TRUCK IS STARTED).   I HAVE LOOKED ON LINE (GOOGLE SEARCH) AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING THERE HEADLIGHTS HAVING A MELTED / BURNT SPOT ON BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT SIDES.   THE  LOCAL DEALER SAYS THERE IS NO FIX OR RECALL CURRENTLY. I HAVE READ THAT SOME PEOPLE WERE GETTING THIS PROBLEM FIXED IF THE MILEAGE OR TIME WAS WITHIN THE WARRANTY. MINE OCCURRED AFTER. I BELIEVE THIS COULD BE A FIRE CONCERN AND THE BURNT SPOT IS SEMI BLOCKING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE DRL. THE DRL IS SO PEOPLE CAN SEE YOU COMING. THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL!  *TR",
