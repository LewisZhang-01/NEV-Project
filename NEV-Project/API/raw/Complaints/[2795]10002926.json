WHILE THIS IS HAPPENING, THE REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER WILL NOT SHUT OFF, AND THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT WORK.  THE CHECK ENGINE SOON LIGHT IS CONSTANTLY ON.  THE TURN SIGNALS ARE BLINKING RAPIDLY OR NOT WORKING ON SOME OCCASIONS.  MY WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED AS OF LAST YEAR.  THE TRANSMISSION HAS ALREADY BEEN REBUILT AND WE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE DOOR AJAR WARNING LIGHTS NOT GOING OFF AND THE DOOR LOCK MOTOR HAD TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE AT FIRST THEY WERE LOCKING ON THEIR OWN REPEATEDLY.  I FEEL LIKE THESE WERE ALL A RESULT OF WIRING PROBLEMS, BUT WE HAD SUCH A HARD TIME GETTING ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS REPAIRED THAT I'M NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING BACK TO THE DEALER AGAIN, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED.  THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN A LEMON THE WHOLE TIME WE HAVE OWNED IT.",
