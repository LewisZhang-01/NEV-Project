THIS AFTERNOON A PASSENGER AND I PULLED OUT ONTO THE MAIN THOROUGHFARE WHEN MY CAR (2005 TAURUS) INDEPENDENTLY ACCELERATED AND BEGAN RUNNING/SPINNING AT A HIGH RPM.  THE EXPERIENCE WAS NOT UNLIKE A SELF PROPELLED VACUUM WHERE YOU LET GO AND IT WANTS TO RUN OFF BY ITSELF - ONLY THIS IS FAR MORE DANGEROUS HAVING BEEN IN TRAFFIC WITH PRECIOUS LIVES AT STAKE.  IT WAS NOT WANTING ME TO BRAKE EITHER.  THANKFULLY, I WAS ABLE TO PULL OFF INTO A GRAVEL LOT.  I TURNED THE CAR OFF FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN STARTED IT AGAIN ONLY THAT TIME IT WAS RUNNING AT ROCKET SPEED.  NEEDLESS TO SAY IT WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AT THAT POINT SO I HAD IT TOWED TO THE LOCAL FORD DEALER.  THEY JUST CALLED TO SAY IT WAS THE \"SPEED CONTROL CABLE\" THAT APPEARED TO DISENGAGE AND DO SOMETHING WITH THE THROTTLE.  CLEARLY THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH THE MAKE AND MODEL OF CAR BASED ON THE CUMULATIVE POSTS I AM SEEING.  FORD NEEDS TO STEP UP OR THE NTSB NEEDS TO STEP IN. *JB",
