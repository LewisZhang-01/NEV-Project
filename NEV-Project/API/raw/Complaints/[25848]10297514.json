AFTER 15 DAYS, THE VEHICLE WAS RETURNED, PRETTY, BUT IN MECHANICALLY WORSE SHAPE THAN WHEN IT WAS DROPPED OFF. IT LEAKS POWER STEERING, THE POWER STEERING IS LOOSE, THE EXHAUST IS HANGING AND BENT, AND THE STRUT HOUSING IS UNSTABLE AND LOOSE, ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE. THERE IS A VISIBLE GAP IN THE REAR DOOR, WHICH WAS THE CHEIF COMPLAINT AFTER THE CRASH. ESSENTIALLY, THEY MADE THE VAN LOOK PRETTY, AND THEN RETURNED IT TO ME AFTER BREAKING THE THINGS NECESSARY TO PASS TO GET TO THE PARTS NEEDING REPAIR. *TR",
