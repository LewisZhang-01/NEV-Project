I HAVE TO JUMP START MY CAR WITB A HALO PORTABLE CHARGER, EVERY SINGLE TIME I WANT TO DRIVE IT. SOMETIMES MY CAR CUTS OFF AND LOSES POWER WHILE I'M DRIVING WHICH HAS ALMOST CAUSED ME AN ACCIDENT TWICE! MY CAR HAS RANDOMLY CUT OFF IN MOTION WHILE I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY, APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION, AND ON A RURAL ROAD IN ANOTHER CITY. I HAVE CALLED BEFORE AND WAS TOLD TO FILE A COMPLAINT ONLINE. THIS ISSUE STARTED HAPPENING A YEAR AGO BUT ONLY OCCASIONALLY. NOW THIS HAPPENS FREQUENTLY. I ASSUMED I HAD A BAD BATTERY OR ALTERNATOR OR STARTER, SO I REPLACED ALL THREE PARTS, INCLUDING SPARK PLUGS, WIRES AND AIR FILTERS. I'M STILL HAVING THE SAME ISSUE AND NEED THIS RESOLVED. I NEED TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO AND FROM WORK AND DO NOT DEEL SAFE DRIVING IT ESPECIALLY DURING THE WINTER MONTHS, WHEN IT RANDOMLY CUTS OFF. PLEASE HELP RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. I AM A LONG TIME PONTIAC OWNER AND DO NOT WANT TO GET RID OF A FULLY PAID  FOR CAR IF THE ISSUE CAN BE RESOLVED BY YOUR COMPANY.",
