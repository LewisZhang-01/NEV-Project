        "summary": "I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY 2001 FORD FOCUS ZX3.  IT HAS THE ZETEC ENGINE AND THE MTX75 5 SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSION.  THE FUEL PUMP FOR THIS VEHICLE IS IN THE FUEL TANK (I HAVE HAD THE CAR IN FOR FUEL GAUGE REPAIR A COUPLE OF TIMES).  THE PROBLEM OCCURS WHENEVER THERE IS HALF A TANK OR LESS SHOWING ON THE FUEL GAUGE.  WHEN TAKING A RIGHT HAND TURN - I.E. EXPRESSWAY ON/OFF RAMP - THE CAR ENGINE WILL STUTTER AND DIE. THIS ONLY HAPPENS TURNING TO THE RIGHT.  THE LOWER THE FUEL GAUGE READING, THE MORE SEVERE THE PROBLEM BECOMES. TURNING LEFT HAS NO ILL EFFECT ON DRIVE ABILITY. IT SEEMS THE FUEL PUMP IS NOT AT FAULT.  ONLY UNDER THE RIGHT TURN CONDITIONS DO I EXPERIENCE ANY LOSS OF FUEL TO THE ENGINE.  COULD THIS BE A DESIGN FLAW IN THE FUEL PICK-UP SYSTEM?  I HAVE HEARD OF MANY COMPLAINTS ON THIS VERY ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  TIM RUITER - MICHIGAN CERTIFIED MASTER MECHANIC # M140125  *JB",
