MY OBSERVATIONS INCLUDE A POSSIBLE LOSS IN POWER AND AFFECTS ENGINE PERFORMANCE, AND POSSIBLY THE LONGEVITY OF THE ENGINE. I TOOK IT TO A SECOND TOYOTA DEALER WHERE IT WAS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED BUT A SOLUTION IS YET TO BE DETERMINED SINCE THE V6 4.0 IS A NEW ENGINE. CURRENTLY, I WAIT FOR A TOYOTA TECHNICIAN FROM THE FACTORY TO EXAMINE THE ENGINE. MEANWHILE, I CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE AND I AM AFRAID THAT I AM DOING MORE HARM TO IT'S LIFE EXPECTANCY. WHAT STEPS CAN I TAKE TO ACCELERATE THE PROCESS SINCE I FEEL THAT I AM BEING GIVEN THE RUNAROUND. I HAVE BEEN A FAITHFUL TOYOTA CUSTOMER AS THIS IS MY 3RD 4RUNNER, AND HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCE ANYTHING LIKE THIS.   MANY THANKS.   *NLM",
