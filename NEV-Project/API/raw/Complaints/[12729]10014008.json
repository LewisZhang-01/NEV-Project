THIS PROBLEM RESULTS IN A BLOWN HEAD GASKET THAT REQUIRES REPAIR AT GREAT EXPENSE.  IN ADDITION THE REPAIR THAT IS APPROVED BY FORD IS NOT PERMANENT, SO THE VEHICLE MANY TIMES HAS THE SAME PROBLEM MULTIPLE TIMES.  I PERSONALLY HAVE A VEHICLE WITH THIS PROBLEM AND HAVE SEVERAL FRIENDS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  I BELIEVE THAT FORD NEEDS TO ISSUE A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM AND FIX IT RIGHT SO THAT RECURRENCES DO NOT HAPPEN.  *JB",
