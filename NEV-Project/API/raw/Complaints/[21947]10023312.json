        "summary": "I HAD THE BRAKES SERVICED ON MY 2001 VOLVO S40 AT THE VOLVO DEALER. AT ONLY 21,500 MILES THE REAR BRAKES WERE GRINDING LOUDLY. I COMPLAINED TO VOLVO CONSUMER SERVICES FROM THEIR WEB PAGE. THEY WERE NOT ONLY NOT SURPRISED AT THE REAR BRAKE FAILURE AT 21,500 MILES, BUT SAID THAT THEY USUALLY GO OUT BETWEEN 10K AND 20K MILES.  THE REAR BRAKES ON THAT VEHICLE ARE POORLY DESIGNED, CREATING A POTENTIAL ACCIDENT HAZARD BECAUSE OF CONSUMERS' IGNORANCE OF THEIR UNDER-ENGINEERING. AN AMERICAN CAR WOULD LIKELY GET AS MUCH AS 80K MILES OUT OF THE REAR BRAKES, BEING REPLACED ONLY THE THIRD TIME THE FRONT BRAKES ARE SERVICE. AN AMERICAN CAR COMPANY THAT IS AS OBVIOUSLY AWARE OF A FAILURE OF THIS NATURE WOULD LIKELY HAVE DONE A REDESIGN AND RECALL. THE REAR BRAKE PADS ON THE VOLVO S40 ARE NO BIGGER THAN THOSE OF A MOTORCYCLE. THIS IS AN UNSAFE VEHICLE AND VOLVO SHOULD BE FORCED TO RECALL THEM.   *NLM",
