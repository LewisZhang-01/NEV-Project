THE ENGINE WILL STOP BUT ALL INTERIOR POWER REMAINS ON, AND I MUST RESTART THE ENGINE, SHIFT GEARS, RETURN TO PARK AND TRY AGAIN.  SOMETIMES IT TAKES 5-8 TRIES TO KILL POWER.  THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD AS IT COULD LEAVE YOU STRANDED WITH A DEAD BATTERY.  I'VE SEEN MANY SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ON YOUR WEBSITE, BUT MAZDA CLAIMS NO OWNERSHIP OF THE PROBLEM AND HAVE NOT ISSUED A RECALL.  HOW CAN YOU RECTIFY THIS SITUATION?",
