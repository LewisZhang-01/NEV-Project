IN NOVEMBER 2005 ,  AND AGAIN MAY 2007,  THE 2000 BRAVADA WHILE DRIVING ON HIGHWAY ALL OF A SUDDEN STARTED SLOWING DOWN AND MADE LOUD SOUNDS. THE BRAVADA WOULD NOT GO NO MORE THEN 20 MPH AS I WAS ON A 65 MPH HIGHWAY. GOT OFF NEAREST EXT AND PULLED INTO A PARKING LOT TO EXAMINE. AS I TRIED TO BACK OUT OF THE PARKING LOT THE CAR WOULD NOT BACK UP, BUT  WOULD ONLY GO FORWARD. IT SOUNDED LIKE THE AUTOMATIC SHIFTING GEARS WERE NOT ALIGNED ANYMORE. I TOOK THE CAR TO AAMCO, AND WAS TOLD I WAS CORRECT,  AND THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAD TO BE REBUILT . ALSO, STATED THAT THE CAR BUILT WITH A PART TO GO UP TO ABOUT  125000 MILES,  BUT IF THE CAR  WENT OVER THAT THEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE MANUFACTURER HASN'T MADE A PART TO CARRY THE CAR OVER THAT MILEAGE. THIS SAME ISSUE HAPPENED  AGAIN. EACH TIME I TOOK TO 4 DIFFERENT TRANSMISSION PLACES  AND TOLD SAME THING REGARDING MANUFACTURER,  AND WAY THEY BUILT IT.  *AK",
