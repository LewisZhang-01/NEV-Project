THE CAR DOESN'T PROCEED AT ALL OR GAIN ENOUGH SPEED TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY AFTER MY STEPPING ON THE GAS PEDAL FROM A FULL-STOPPED POSITION. I HAD AN ACCIDENT ON 10/02/07 PARTIALLY DUE TO THE ISSUE BECAUSE I COULDN'T AVOID FAST ENOUGH A VEHICLE MAKING A RECKLESS LEFT-TURN. THERE WAS NO INJURY AMONG RIDERS IN MY CAR ALTHOUGH THE OTHER DRIVER ESCAPED THE ACCIDENT SCENE AND I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THE DRIVER IS HURT. MY CAR IS IN AN AUTO BODY SHOP CURRENTLY BUT WOULDN'T LIKE TO DRIVE IT ONCE IT IS FIXED A FEW DAYS FROM TODAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS? THANK YOU.   *JB",
