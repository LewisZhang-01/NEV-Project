        "summary": "WHEN I RIDE THROUGH PUDDLES OF WATER, I LOOSE THE ABILITY TO STEER MY VEHICLE.  I WAS TURNING THE CORNER ENTERING ONTO A MAIN ROAD THAT HAD A MODERATE SIZE PUDDLE OF WATER.  I LOSS THE ABILITY TO STEER MY VAN AND ALMOST RAN INTO THE MEDIAN.  THE LOSS WAS ONLY FOR A FEW SECONDS BUT LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO LOOSE CONTROL OF MY VAN.  I COULD NOT STEER MY VEHICLE AFTER A VERY HARD GUST OF RAIN SHOWERED MY VEHICLE AS I WAS YIELDING BEFORE ENTERING A MAIN HIGHWAY.  AFTER PROCEEDING ONTO THE HWY I HAD TO STOP AND WAIT SEVERAL SECONDS BEFORE BEING ABLE TO STEER THE VEHICLE.  I HAVE HAD ONE OTHER OCCURRENCE AFTER SPLASHING INTO A VERY SMALL PUDDLE OF WATER ENTERING INTO THE DEVELOPMENT THAT I LIVE IN.  I WAS TRAVELING VERY SLOWLY AS I WAS APPROACHING THE GUARD GATE.  I HAD TO WAIT AT LEAST 20 SECONDS BEFORE BEING ABLE TO STEER MY VEHICLE.  EACH OCCURRENCE THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT I LOOSE STEERING SEEMS TO INCREASE.  EACH TIME IT SEEMS THE WATER SPLASHES ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE. THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME A PROBLEM WITHIN THE LAST YEAR.  I AM VERY CONCERNED AND WILL BE CONTACTING MY DEALER. *TR",
