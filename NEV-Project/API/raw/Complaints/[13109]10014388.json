LAST WEEK  4 INJECTORS AND THEIR SEALS WERE REPLACE (AT MY EXPENSE) AND ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT THERE IS A STRONG SMELL OF RAW GASOLINE.  THIS IS A SERIOUS FIRE POTENTIAL PROBLEM AND SEEMS RELATE TO THE SWITCH TO DIFFERENT GASOLINE FORMULATIONS REQUIRED HERE FOR SUMMER DRIVING.  THE CAR IS AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIRS.   *NLM",
