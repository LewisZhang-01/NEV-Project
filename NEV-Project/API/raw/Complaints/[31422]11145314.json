        "summary": "VEHICLE CURRENTLY HAS 25,XXX MILES ON IT. IT HAS THE 1.6L TURBO ENGINE WITH DCT (DUAL CLUTCH TRANSMISSION). IT IS VERY UNPREDICTABLE IN REGARD TO MAKING A SMOOTH START FROM STANDSTILL. THE IS CONSIDERABLE LAG AND JERKING BEFORE THE VEHICLE WILL RESPOND WITH FORWARD MOTION. SOMETIMES, JUST RELEASING THE BRAKE AT A STOP, THE VEHICLE WILL BUCK AND JERK WITHOUT EVEN TOUCHING THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL.THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD AS IT IS UNPREDICTABLE ON THE SEVERITY AND WHEN IT WILL OCCUR. TAKING THE CAR TO THE DEALER WAS NOT OF ANY HELP. THEY PERFORMED SCANS AND SAID EVERYTHING WAS \"NORMAL\". THEY GAVE ME A PAPER DESCRIPTION ON HOW THE DCT OPERATES BUT THAT DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THEY BASICALLY SAID THAT'S THE WAY IT IS, JUST GET USED TO IT. PERFORMING A GOGGLE SEARCH YIELDS MANY SIMILAR COMPLAINTS. HYUNDAI HAS NOT OWNED UP TO THIS PROBLEM AS FAR AS I CAN TELL. PERHAPS IF ENOUGH OWNERS REPORT THIS COMMON PROBLEM, HYUNDAI WILL BE FORCED TO PERFORM A RECALL WITH A SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN NOTICED CONTINUALLY ON AN INTERMITTENT BASIS SINCE OCT OF 2018.",
