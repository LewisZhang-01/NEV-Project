PEOPLE WILL DIE FROM THIS, IT IS THAT LOOSE. MY WIFE REFUSES TO DRIVE IT AFTER ONE TRIP. I CONTACTED JEEP AND THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS A TSB FOR MY JEEP. THE DEALERSHIP SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG AND WHEN I COMPLAINED ABOUT THE TSB THEY CLAIMED THEY DID IT. THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE STEERING. I JUST REACHED 2000 MILES. I CAN'T AFFORD TO JUST GET RID OF IT.",
