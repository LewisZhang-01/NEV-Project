WE QUESTIONED THIS WITH THE SALESMAN UPON PURCHASE AND WE WERE REASSURED THEY WORK FINE THEN WE ASKED ABOUT IT AFTER PURCHASE WHILE IN FOR OTHER REPAIRS STILL REASSURED THEY WORK FINE CAUSE \"IF IT DOESN'T DO IT WHILE IT IS HERE THEN THERE ISN'T ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT\". (THAT IS WHAT THE TECH'S ALWAYS SAY WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER) WE HAD THE WORST RUN IN WITH THE ELECTRONIC DOORS THIS MORNING 6/19/2008! DRIVERS SIDE. I A GROWN 115 POUND 5FOOT 4 WOMAN WAS PINNED HIP TO HIP MY RIGHT KNEE WAS RESTING ON THE FLOOR BOARD FACING IN THE CAR . WHILE I PUSHED BACK TO GET FREE THE DOOR ONLY MADE THE NOISES OF IT TRYING TO OPEN DDD DDD DDD IT DID NOT FOR AT LEAST A MINUTE THAT IS A LONG TIME TO HAVE THAT CONTINUALLY ADDING MORE PRESSURE WHILE THE DOOR TRIED TO FORCE ITSELF CLOSED ON ME AS AN ADULT THANK GOD IT WAS NOT ONE OF MY SMALLER CHILDREN. I AM POSITIVE THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED EXTREME INJURIES ON ONE OF THEM OR ANY CHILD. IM SURPRISED IT DIDN'T INJURE ME WORSE. I WAS SURE THE LATCH HAD PUNCTURED MY THIGH FORTUNATELY IT HAD NOT. I WAS LEFT WITH A GOOD SIZE PROBABLY 1 1/2 - 2 IN HARD LUMP AND A WONDERFULLY COLORFUL BRUISE AND LOTS OF SORENESS NOT ONLY TO THE TOUCH BUT WALKING AND PUTTING MY WEIGHT DOWN ON MY RIGHT LEG.  *TR",
