THERE IS SIGNIFICANT WEAR ON THE FRONT TIRES AND THE VEHICLE WILL NOT STAY IN ALIGNMENT. THERE IS A SCREECHING NOISE COMING FROM THE REAR. AFTER HAVING THE TIMING BELT REPLACED, I WAS INFORMED BY THE MECHANIC THERE WAS A RUST PROBLEM IN THE FRONT PART OF THE VEHICLE TOWARD THE FRONT RIGHT TIRE. HE TOLD ME THE CAR IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND THE RUST ON THIS VEHICLE IS MORE LIKE RUST OF A VEHICLE THAT IS 50 YEARS OLD NOT TEN YEARS. HE ALSO SAID THE FRAME COULD BREAK AT ANY TIME TO CONTACT A HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP. I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THERE WERE NO RECALLS FOR THIS PROBLEM FOR MY VEHICLE. I CALLED HYUNDAI'S 800 NUMBER ONLY TO BE TOLD THE SAME THING.  *TR",
