WITH A FEW THOUSAND MILES WE TOOK THE VAN INTO THE DEALER REPORTING A \"CLUNK\" AT ABOUT 10 MPH. THEY SAID IT WAS NOT A PROBLEM. AT 40,000 MILES NOW THEY SAY I NEED A NEW TORQUE CONVERTER. NOT KNOWING I HAD PREVIOUSLY BROUGHT THE VAN IN WE TOLD THEM ABOUT THE CLUNK AND THEY SAID IT WAS A PROBLEM. MY NEIGHBORS WHO BOUGHT THE SAME VAN FROM THE SAME DEALER THE SAME DAY ALSO HAD THE TRANSMISSION REPLACED ABOUT 1 MONTH AGO WITH ABOUT 39,000 MILES. HER VAN JUST QUIT IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION. *JB",
