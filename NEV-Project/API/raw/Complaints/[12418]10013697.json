REPLACED ONE HEADLIGHT WITH USED PARTIALLY CLEAR UNIT 2 YEARS AGO. IT TO NOW IS FOGGED TO THE POINT I CAN DRIVE WITH MY HIGH BEAMS ON AND NO ONE KNOWS IT.  MY CARAVAN HEADLIGHTS ON BRIGHT ARE CONSIDERABLY LESS BRIGHT THAN MY 10 YR OLD CIVIC ON NORMAL SETTING.  LUCKILY I HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT FROM THIS INADEQUACY BUT ONLY BECAUSE I DRIVE AROUND WITH MY HIGH BEAMS ON TO HELP PROJECT SOME LIGHT ON THE ROAD DUE TO THESE DEFECTIVE LENSES.",
