THERE HAS BEEN A NOISE THAT THEY CLAIMED FIRST WAS THE KNOCK SENSOR, THEY REPLACED THAT, AND NOW THEY BELIEVE IT IS THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD HOWEVER IF IT IS JUST THE GASKETS THEY WANT $400.00 TO REPLACE OR IF IT IS CRACKED WHICH THEY CAN'T TELL ME FOR SURE IT'S COVERED UNDER THE 60,000 WARRANTY. THE MOST UPSETTING THING IS THIS PROBLEM EXISTED BEFORE WARRANTY EXPIRATION AND THEY STILL HAVE NOT FIXED IT.   *NLM",
