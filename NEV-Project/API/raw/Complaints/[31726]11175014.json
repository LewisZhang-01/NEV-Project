        "summary": "MY BRAKES ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY. I FIRST NOTICED MY BRAKE NOT RESPONDING CORRECTLY TO THE NORMAL AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ON 1/15/19. I WOULD APPLY NORMAL PRESSURE AND HAVE NO RESPONSE, AND HAVE TO PRESS HARDER TO GET ANY KIND OF DECLINE IN SPEED. I TOOK IT TO A LOCAL SHOP AND THEY PUT ON BRAKES, ROTORS, AND FLUSHED THE BRAKE SYSTEM. A FEW WEEKS WENT BY AND THE BRAKES WERE OKAY, BUT STILL NOT NORMAL. ON 2/1/19 THE BRAKES WOULD COMPLETELY FAIL. I WOULD PRESS THE BRAKE AND THE BRAKE WOULD HIT THE FLOOR WITH NO BACKWARD PRESSURE ON MY FOOT AND NO SLOWING OF THE CAR. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE SHOP ON 2/2/19 AND THEY FLUSHED MY BRAKES. I RAN A FEW ERRANDS AND RETURNED MY CAR THAT SAME DAY BECAUSE IT WAS STILL NOT STOPPING PROPERLY. THEY FLUSHED THE BRAKES AGAIN AND SUGGESTED I SEE A NISSAN SERVICE CENTER IF THAT DID NOT FIX IT. ON 2/4/19 I TOOK MY CAR TO A NISSAN SERVICE CENTER. THEY COULD NOT FIND THE ISSUE, BUT SUGGEST A BRAKE FLUSH. I DECLINED BECAUSE OF THE PRICE AND MY BRAKES HAD BEEN FLUSHED TWICE TWO DAYS PRIOR. BUT TO BE SAFE,I RETURNED IT TO THE ORIGINAL SHOP AND HAD THEM FLUSH MY BRAKES AGAIN. THE CAR WILL NOW STOP. HOWEVER, THE SAME AMOUNT OF PRESSURE MAY CAUSE A SUDDEN STOP OR A SMOOTH STOP. THE BRAKES ARE STILL NOT RESPONDING PROPERLY AND I AM AFRAID THEY WILL FAIL AGAIN. I CALLED THE NISSAN CUSTOMER AFFAIRS LINE AND THEY SAID TO HAVE A NISSAN SERVICE CENTER FLUSH THE BRAKES. A BRAKE FLUSH IS A BRAKE FLUSH AND IT IS NOT WORTH $118 TO HAVE A NISSAN SHOP FLUSH MY BRAKES FOR THE SAME OUTCOME. I LOOKED ONLINE TO SEE IF OTHER 2013 NISSAN ROGUE OWNERS HAD SUDDEN BRAKE FAILURE, AND THEY HAVE. I BELIEVE THIS IS WORTH LOOKING INTO. ACCIDENTS ARE HAPPENING BECAUSE OF SOMETHING WITH THIS ROGUE, NOT BECAUSE OF MY LACK OF MAINTAINING IT. THIS IS NISSAN'S FAILURE, NOT THE CONSUMER.",
