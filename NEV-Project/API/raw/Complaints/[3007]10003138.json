I HAD NOT REALIZED THAT I HAD BEEN LIED TO.  ON DECEMBER 24, 2002 MY CAR BROKE DOWN AGAIN.  NOW COIL #4 HAD BURNT OUT.  THIS TIME I WAS TOLD THAT IT IS A REOCCURRING PROBLEM IN 2002 JETTAS WITH 1.8T ENGINES.  I ASKED IF ALL COILS COULD BE REPLACED BUT WAS TOLD NO.  I WAS TOLD THAT I JUST HAVE TO WAIT FOR MY CAR TO BREAK DOWN AGAIN AND IT PROBABLY WOULD.  WHY IS THERE NO RECALL?  ACCORDING O VW, THEY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH PARTS TO HAVE A RECALL.  THIS IS ABSURD!",
