DURING A ROAD TRIP TO A NEARBY CITY EARLY THIS SPRING I WAS BARLEY ABLE TO SEE OUT THE WINDSHIELD BECAUSE OF THE ICE AND FOG ON MY WINDSHIELD.  I BELIEVE THIS IS A KNOWN MECHANICAL DEFECT BY FORD AND DEALERS.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM.  IN CONTACTING SEVERAL SEATTLE-AREA DEALERS, ALL REFUSED TO FIX AS A SAFETY PROBLEM, SAID NO RECALL HAD BEEN ISSUED, SAID I WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, THIS IS ABSURD FOR A PROBLEM THEY CAUSED WITH FAULTY DESIGN AND PARTS THAT CAUSES SERIOUS VISIBILITY PROBLEMS IN MANY OLDER EXPLORERS. *JB",
