THE DEALER STATES THAT APPROXIMATELY 1,000 CUSTOMERS HAVE HAD REPLACEMENT ROTORS INSTALLED AND MORE THAN 20% CONTINUE TO RETURN BECAUSE OF PULSATION AND BRAKE PROBLEMS.  I BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL AFTER COUNTLESS THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS LIKE MYSELF HAVE HAD TO ENDURE NOT ONLY UNSAFE DRIVING AS A RESULT OF THIS PROBLEM, BUT INCONVENIENCES, ADDITIONAL OUT OF POCKET COSTS, TIME WASTED  AND THE HASSLES OF DEALING WITH THE MANUFACTURE.  THIS PROBLEM WILL NOT GO AWAY UNLESS NHTSA DOES SOMETHING.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE.   *NLM",
