IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ECU IN THESE TRUCKS IS FAULTY DUE TO MANUFACTURING DEFECTS. I FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT THOUSANDS OF OTHERS HAVE THESE PROBLEMS.  PLEASE INITIATE A RECALL OF THESE VEHICLES AND FORCE ISUZU TO REPAIR THESE DANGEROUS DEFECTS AT THEIR EXPENSE, NOT THE CONSUMERS'.  PLEASE TAKE ACTION ON THIS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION.  I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR INSTRUCTING ISUZU TO CONTACT ME WITH INFORMATION ON WHERE I CAN HAVE MY TRUCK TOWED TO BE REPAIRED. IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE IT.  SEVERAL GARAGES SAID THEY CANNOT DIAGNOSE AND FIX THE PROBLEM, AND THAT ISUZU MUST RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.  MANY THANKS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.   *NLM",
