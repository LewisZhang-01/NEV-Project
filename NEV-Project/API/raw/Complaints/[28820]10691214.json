AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A FLUKE UNTIL IT HAS CONTINUED TO HAPPEN. I'VE SPENT THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS DOING RESEARCH ON THE ISSUE. MY SITUATION IS EXACTLY LIKE THE COMPLAINTS THAT WERE MADE THAT CAUSED THE EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THE ISSUE. MY CONCERN IS WHEN PUTTING MY VIN NUMBER IN IT DOESN'T SHOW THE COMPLAINT. I WANTED TO LODGE THIS COMPLAINT THIS WAY WHEN I GO TO THE DEALERSHIP TO GET IT CORRECTED I HAVE A POINT OF REFERENCE. ONE DAY I HAD MY SEVEN YEAR OLD SON AND 6 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER IN THE CAR, IT WAS RAINING AND THE CAR STARTED TO STALL AT ABOUT 35 MPH I TAPPED THE GAS TO PREVENT IT FROM STALLING. THE TEMPORARY STALL DISENGAGED MY TRACTION CONTROL AND I SLID INTO ON COMING TRAFFIC. I WAS ABLE TO MANEUVER THROUGH IT HOWEVER MY CHILDREN COULD HAVE DIED. I HOPE CHRYSLER DOES THE RIGHT THING FOR ME.  *TR",
