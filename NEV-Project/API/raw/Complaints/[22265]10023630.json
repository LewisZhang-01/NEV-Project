SEPT 2002. RACK & PINION WAS FOUND DEFECTIVE AND WAS REPLACED.  WHEELS WERE BALANCED MANY TIMES BY DEALER AND ALSO ALIGNED.  REAR ROTORS WERE RESURFACED IN DEC 2002 AND FRONT ROTORS WERE REPLACED IN MARCH 2003.   FRONT TIRES ARE WORN UNEVENLY, DEALER CANNOT EXPLAIN WHY.  THESE ARE NEW TIRES THAT DEALER PUT ON VEHICLE IN OCT 2002 TO ELIMINATE VIBRATIONS.  WHEELS WERE BALANCED AND ALIGNMENT DONE AGAIN LAST WEEK TO TRY TO RESOLVE  PROBLEMS.(I PAID FOR THIS SERVICE)  DEALER CANNOT IDENTIFY WHAT IS CAUSING PROBLEMS AND AT THIS TIME THEY REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING UNDER THE WARRANTY TO RECTIFY PROBLEMS  OF VIBRATIONS. I NEED HELP PLEASE.  I FEEL VERY UNSAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE ESPECIALLY MORE NOW SINCE FRONT TIRES ARE WORN UNEVENLY.  DEALER TRIED ON MANY ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS AND STILL CANNOT  FIX THE PROBLEMS.   *JB",
