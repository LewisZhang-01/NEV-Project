IT MADE ME THINK BACK ABOUT MY VAN AND REALIZE THAT MY SEAT BELTS HAVE BECOME UNLATCHED.  I HAVE ALSO PUT MY CHILDREN'S CAR SEATS IN AND THEY TOO HAVE BECOME UNLATCHED.  ABOUT A MONTH AGO I WENT AWAY AND BOUGHT MY DOG ALONG, I PLACED MY DOG IN THE SEAT WITH A DOG SEAT BELT AND SHE KEPT BECOMING UNLATCHED. I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND WANT THE GEN 4 SEAT BELTS INSTALLED IN MY VAN. I AM GOING TO TRY AND SELL IT NOW UNLESS I GET IT CHANGED. WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE PUTTING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN DANGER WHEN THE CONSUMER/VICTIM ARE TRYING TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY FROM HARM.  HOW DARE THEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I WANT SOMETHING DONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!            *JB",
