        "summary": "I ALSO GET THE BRAKE LIGHT CIRCUIT PROBLEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  THE SHORT IS ACTUALLY IN THE BRAKE LIGHT HOUSING, AND THE METAL CLIP GETS ERODED FROM A HEAT BUILD UP DUE TO THE SHORT.  THIS CAUSES A SMALL HOLE IN THE METAL CLIP OF THE BULB, AND THEREFORE, EACH TIME YOU REPLACE THE BULBS, YOU GET A NEW HOLE.  I HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM FOR ABOUT 4 YEARS, AND I JUST KEEP REPLACING THE BULBS AND THE PARTS, SINCE MY WARRANTY IS EXPIRED.  ( I HAVE A '95 325 I THAT I BOUGHT IN '97.)  I ALSO HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE LOCK MECHANISM - SOMETIMES THE DRIVERS SIDE LOCK WILL NOT UNLOCK AUTOMATICALLY WITH THE FRONT SEATS.  IT IS JUST EXPECTED THAT BMWS HAVE ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS.  PERHAPS NEXT TIME I WILL GET A HONDA.*JB",
