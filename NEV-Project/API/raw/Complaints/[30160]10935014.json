A YEAR OR SO INTO OWNING THE VAN WE STARTED GETTING A WARNING ABOUT THE BLIND SPOT SYSTEM NOT BEING AVAILABLE AND SAID THAT IT NEEDED SERVICE. IT STARTED HAPPENING WHEN THE SNOW STARTED FLYING HERE IN MICHIGAN. NOW AS SOON AS YOU START THE VEHICLE IT STATES IT IS NOT AVAILABLE AND LEAVES THE TRIANGLES LIT IN THE MIRRORS WITH AN OCCASIONAL BEEPING SOUND. FROM OTHER POSTS AND RESEARCH I HAVE READ THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON ISSUE WITH WATER GETTING INTO THESE SENSORS AND SHORTING THEM OUT.  WHY THESE SENSORS WEREN'T MADE MORE WEATHER PROOF IS BEYOND ME.  SINCE THIS IS AN ADD ON TO MAKE DRIVING SAFER I THINK CHRYSLER SHOULD STEP UP, BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND RECALL THESE VERY EXPENSIVE SAFETY MODULES.  TO HAVE JUST ONE OF THE TWO SENSORS REPLACED BY A DEALER IS $1200.  *TR",
