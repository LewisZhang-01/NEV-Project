IT IS NOW LATE APRIL OF 2015 AND ACCORDING TO TOYOTA'S WEB SITE THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX IT. WHEN I CONTACT THE DEALER, ALL THEY SAY IS WE ARE POWERLESS UNTIL WE HEAR FROM TOYOTA.     I AM CONCERNED THAT TOYOTA DOES NOT WANT TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION. SURELY  COMPANY WITH TOYOTA'S STAFF AND RESOURCES COULD HAVE COME UP WITH SOMETHING BY NOW.  *TR",
