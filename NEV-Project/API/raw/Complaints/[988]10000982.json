IT JUST DIES WITH NO WARNING OF ANY KIND.WE FOUND A MECHANIC LAST FRI. WHO TOLD US THAT IT IS A PROBLEM WITH 1998 JAGS AND THAT IT IS THE THROTTLE BODY AND THAT IT SHOULD BE A  RECALL AND THAT THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD HAVE TO REPAIR THIS AT NO COST. HOW CAN THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE CARS LIKE THIS ON THE ROAD? IT IS A HORRIBLE FEELING AND VERY DANGEROUS! WHAT A LAW SUIT WAITING TO HAPPEN. THIS USED CAR WAS PURCHASED OFF A LEASE AND WE HAVE ONLY HAD IT SINCE NOV.27,2002. THESE 4 INCIDENTS HAPPENED IN A SPAN OF 6-1/2 WEEKS. WE ARE TURNING IT BACK TOMORROW UNTIL THIS PROBLEM IS FIXED. HOPEFULLY MY HUSBAND WILL NOT BE KILLED ON THE WAY TO TURN IT IN.",
