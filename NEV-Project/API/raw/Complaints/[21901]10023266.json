AFTER ANOTHER DEALER BROUGHT THE CAR TO THEM, THEY AGREED TO WORK ON THE CAR.  PONTIAC GM WAS CONTACTED.  GM SAID THAT THERE IS A DESIGN PROBLEM WITH SOME OF THESE PONTIAC GRAND AM'S.  THEY SAID THAT WHEN THE ENGINEERS COME UP WITH A FIX, IT WILL BE FIXED.  THIS WAS 3 MONTHS AGO AND NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE.  I CANNOT TRADE THE CAR IN BECAUSE OF THESE PROBLEMS.  THE CAR HAS BEEN FIXED UNDER WARRANTY THREE TIMES AND BEEN TOWED IN TO THE DEALER TWICE.  I HAVE COMPLAINED TO NO AVAIL.   *JB",
