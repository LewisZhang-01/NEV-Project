IT HAS SUFFERED SEVERAL PROBLEMS, ALL THAT HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH BY VICTORY IN A TIMELY FASHION, BUT I FEEL THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO REPORT THIS MATTER TO YOU BECAUSE OTHER VICTORY OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR ISSUES.  THE NHTSA WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN CAUSING A RECALL FOR THE FUEL PUMP, OF WHICH I SUFFERED ONE FAILURE.  VICTORY REPLACED THAT ORIGINAL PUMP WITHOUT QUESTION.  MY MAIN AREA OF CONCERN IS THE ORIGINAL TRANSMISSION.  ON 7/26/01, THE FRONT DRIVE SPROCKET WAS REPLACED AFTER IT SPUN ON WHILE I WAS ON A TOUR, WITH JUST OVER 15,000 MILES ON THE BIKE.  ON 8/24/02, MY LOCAL DEALER NOTED THAT THE FRONT DRIVE SPROCKET HAD AGAIN WORN OUT, AT JUST OVER 31,000 MILES.   BY 9/24/02, VICTORY HAD REPLACED MY ENTIRE TRANSMISSION.  MY AREA OF CONCERN IS THAT I HAVE SEEN SEVERAL VICTORY MOTORCYCLES FROM 1999 AND 2000 THAT HAVE BEEN REPLACED (THERE WAS A CHANGE IN DESIGN IN 2001, WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE FIXED THE PROBLEM) DUE TO SIMILAR TRANSMISSION ISSUES.  THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE NHTSA SHOULD LOOK INTO.   *NLM",
