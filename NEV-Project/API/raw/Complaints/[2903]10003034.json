SEVERAL TIMES A DAY I FIND THAT MY HAND (ALBEIT A SMALL HAND) ACCIDENTALLY HITS THE CRUISE CONTROL LEVER INSTEAD OF THE TURN SIGNAL - ESPECIALLY WHEN SIGNALLING LEFT.  THIS ACTIVATES THE CRUISE CONTROL AT A TIME WHEN YOU ARE USUALLY GETTING READY TO SLOW DOWN FOR A TURN.  I UNDERSTAND THAT BRAKING WILL TURN OFF THE CRUISE AUTOMATICALLY, BUT IT IS STILL AN INCOVENIENCE AND COULD POTENTIALLY BE DANGEROUS.  I CONTACTED MERCEDES BENZ AND THEY SAID THAT THE CARS ARE ALL PUT THROUGH MANY, MANY TESTS AND THIS PROBLEM DIDN'T SURFACE.  A SOLUTION WOULD BE TOO SHORTEN THE LENGTH OF THE CRUISE HANDLE OR ANGLE IT MORE TOWARD THE DASH.  POSSIBLY THIS WOULD ALLOW FEWER MISTAKES.",
