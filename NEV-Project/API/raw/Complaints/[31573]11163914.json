I WAS DRIVING AND THE CAR STARTED MAKING NOISES AND THEN IT SPUTTED LIKE GOING TO DIE OUT, AND GET REALLY ROUGH DRIVING. I PARKED THE CAR GOT TO WORK, AND  WHEN LEAVING IT WOULD NOT START. BATTERY IS NEW, SO NOT THAT. AFTER ABOUT 4 TRIES IT STARTED UP, THIS WAS WED. THEN FRIDAY, AND ON WAY HOME THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, AS WELL AS HAD ISSUE STARTING. I JUST RECEIVED THIS LETTER TODAY, HOW ODD AND CONFIRMED THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM AND NOT MY IMAGINATION. I HAVE GRANDCHILDREN THAT I PICK UP FROM SCHOOL AND DAY CARE, AND WILL NOT SUBJECT THEM TO THIS UNSAFE CAR. ALSO,LAST WEEK THE GAS GAUGE JUST WENT TO 50 AND IT BINGED TO LET ME KNOW, I DROVE TO THE GAS STATION NEARBY, AND I ROLLED IN.. NOW SEE THAT GAUGE IS ALSO OR COULD BE WRONG..I AM BRINGING IT IN AND HOPING YOU PUT ME IN A RENTAL UNTIL THIS IS FIXED!~",
