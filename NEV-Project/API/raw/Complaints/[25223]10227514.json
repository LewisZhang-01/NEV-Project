TWO DAYS AFTER PURCHASE, I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY THAT HAVE SLITS/GROOVES IN THE SURFACE FOR RAIN RUN OFF.  THE VEHICLE STARTED SWAYING ERRATICALLY SIDE TO SIDE ON OTHER SURFACES IT HANDLES FINE.  I CONTACTED THE HONDA DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND THE SERVICE TECH INSPECTED AND TEST DROVE IT, BUT FOUND NOTHING WRONG.  IT WASN'T UNTIL LAST FRIDAY THAT ANOTHER PERSON EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING ON THE SAME STRETCH OF HIGHWAY WITH A 2008 CR-V WITH THESE TYPE OF BRIDGESTONE TIRES.  THE HONDA TECH TEST DROVE THE CR-V WITH OTHER TYPE OF TIRES AND BRIDGESTONE AND DISCOVERED THE SWAYING OF THE VEHICLE ONLY HAPPENS WITH BRIDGESTONE DUELLAR. AT THIS POINT, THE SERVICE DEPT. AT THIS PARTICULAR DEALER HAS REALLY NOT ADDRESSED THAT THIS VEHICLE WITH THESE PARTICULAR TIRES ON THIS TYPE OF SURFACE IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE NOR IS IT A PRIORITY.  I'VE BEEN DRIVING ON THESE UNSAFE TIRES FOR A WEEK NOW WITH NO RESOLUTION IN SIGHT.  *TR",
