I HAD A NEW BATTERY, FULL TANK OF GAS, IT MADE NO SENSE.  THE PROBLEM IS A CORRODED COMPONENT ON THE FUEL PUMP, NECESSITATING A NEW FUEL PUMP AND COMPONENT.  PER THE SERVICE STATION, THEY WILL USE THE SAME EXACT PART AGAIN, HOWEVER A GEL WILL BE USED ON THE COMPONENT TO AVOID THE CORROSION THAT CAN OCCUR. WHY DIDN'T NISSAN DO THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE??  I AM OUT OVER $500 FOR REPAIRS AND COULD HAVE BEEN INJURED DUE TO THE LOSS OF POWER! *JB",
