        "summary": "BEGINNING IN DECEMBER 2011 I NOTICED THAT THE PLASTIC ON THE BUCKLES WHERE THE SEAT BELT CONNECTS WAS DISCOLORED AND STARTING TO CRACK. I ALSO HAD ISSUES WITH THE DRIVER'S SEAT BELT NOT RETRACTING CORRECTLY AND ONE REAR SEATBELT FRAYING.THIS PROMPTED ME TO CALL NISSAN AT THEIR 1-800 NUMBER AND RECEIVED A FILE NUMBER. I WAS TOLD TO TAKE THIS NUMBER TO A DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THE CAR INSPECTED.     I DID THIS AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME SINCE IT IT LAW THAT I WEAR MY SEATBELT AND THIS IS A SAFETY SYSTEM OF THE CAR. I WENT IN TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT ON JAN 6, 2012. THE DEALERSHIP, FRANK FLETCHER NISSAN IN JOPLIN, MO WAS NICE BUT STATED THEY SAW THE ISSUE WITH THE SEATBELT RETRACTING AND  OTHER ISSUES WITH THE BELTS, BUT COULD NOT REPLACE THEM TILL THEY FAILED COMPLETELY DUE TO WHAT NISSAN HAD STATED. I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO LEAVE WITH THE ISSUE NOT FIXED AND WAS TOLD TO CALL NISSAN TO VOICE MY COMPLAINT. I USED MY FILE NUMBER AND WAS ASSIGNED A REGIONAL SPECIALIST. SHE WORKED WITH ME UNTIL SHE FOUND OUT THAT I WAS TAKING MY CAR TO A DEALER NOT IN HER REGION. AT THAT TIME I WAS ASSIGNED A NEW SPECIALIST AND HAVE NOT HEARD BACK FROM HIM SINCE 1/7/12. I HAVE CALLED AND LEFT VOICEMAILS AND ALSO TALKED TO OTHER REPRESENTATIVES AND THEY SAY HE HAS CALLED ME BACK AND LEFT VOICEMAIL. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY VOICEMAIL AND I HAVE CALLED BACK AT LEAD ONCE EACH DAY TO HAVE ANOTHER REPRESENTATIVE TELL ME THEY CAN NOT HELP ME AND THE ONLY PERSON THAT CAN IS THE PERSON ASSIGNED TO MY CASE. THEY THEN SAY THEY WILL SEND AND INTERNAL MESSAGE AND HAVE THEM CALL ME BACK. I HAVE FOUGHT THIS FOR OVER A TWO WEEKS AND NOT GOTTEN ANY RESOLUTION. ALL I WANT IS MY CAR FIXED SO THAT THE SAFETY EQUIPMENT IN MY VEHICLE WORKS CORRECTLY. I HAVE MENTIONED THIS ON THE PHONE WITH VARIOUS REPRESENTATIVES AND THEY SAY THAT IT IS OK AND TO NOT USE MY CAR OR JUST NOT WEAR MY SEATBELT. THAT IS ILLEGAL AND DANGEROUS.  *TR",
