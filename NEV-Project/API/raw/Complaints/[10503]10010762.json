        "summary": "\"GM SHOULD RECALL FAULTY INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET INSTALLED IN THEIR VEHICLES\".  AS OF APRIL 10, 2002, THERE IS A NATIONWIDE BACKORDER OF THE INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET. AT THIS TIME, IS IT NOT EVEN KNOWN WHEN THE PART WILL BECOME AVAILABLE. BEING AWARE OF THIS PROVES THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM TO BE ADDRESSED. BECAUSE OF APPARENT POOR ENGINEERING, GM CAN NOT MANUFACTURE REPLACEMENTS FAST ENOUGH FOR ALL THE VEHICLES IN WHICH THEY ARE NEEDED.   INTAKE MANIFOLD LEAKS CAN LEAD TO ANY NUMBER OF VERY SERIOUS, AND EXPENSIVE, PROBLEMS. WHILE THE PART ITSELF ISN'T COSTLY, THE LABOR TO REPAIR IT IS VERY INTENSIVE, AND HAS BEEN QUOTED AROUND $800 USD (GIVE OR TAKE A COUPLE HUNDRED DEPENDING ON THE VEHICLE). THIS IS IN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER COSTLY PROBLEM(S) THE INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET LEAK MAY HAVE PRODUCED.    *NLM",
