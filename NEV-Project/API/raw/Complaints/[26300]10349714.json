THE SLIGHTEST SIDE WIND WHILE DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE CAUSES THE FRONT END TO LIFT UP ON ONE SIDE, CAUSING THE CAR TO BE UNSTABLE.  TWICE I HAD TO SWERVE ON THE INTERSTATE.  BOTH TIMES I THOUGHT THE CAR WAS GOING TO ROLL DOWN THE HIGHWAY.  I FEEL VERY LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.  AFTER REPLACING THE FRONT ANTI-SWAY BAR, THE REAR END STILL HAD SOME SWAY, SO I REPLACED IT, TOO.  ONLY EIBERG MAKES REPLACEMENTS SO FAR FOR 2007 & UP FOR THE CIVIC EX.  THE CAR IS NOW SAFE TO DRIVE ON THE INTERSTATE AND DURING WINDY CONDITIONS. *TR",
