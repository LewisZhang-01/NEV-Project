NO REPAIR SHOP WOULD ATTEMPT TO FIX IT BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AIRBAG.  MONTHS LATER A SPLIT DEVELOPED ON PASSENGER SIDE NEAR AIRBAG.  I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THE AIRBAG  MAY OR MAY NOT DEPLOY. I NOW HAVE A 12 INCH SPLIT ON DRIVER SIDE AND A 8 INCH SPLIT OVER THE PASSENGER AIRBAG.   IT IS UNSIGHTLY AND UNSAFE AND EFFECTS THE RESALE OF THE VEHICLE. *TR",
