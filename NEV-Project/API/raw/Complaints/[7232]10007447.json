ALSO SAID THIS IS KNOWN TO HAPPEN IN THESE TRANSMISSIONS AND THAT HE COULD PROBABLY GET FORD TO PAY ABOUT 70% OF REPAIR COST, LEAVING ME TO PAY ABOUT $125. IF THIS IS A COMMONLY OCCURRING SAFETY PROBLEM, THEN FORD SHOULD RECALL THESE TRANSMISSIONS AND PAY FOR COMPLETE REPAIR COSTS. MY CAR WENT FROM HAVING SHIFTING PROBLEMS TO FINALLY HAVING THE MOTOR DIE AT INTERSECTIONS WHEN STOPPING, DUE TO TRANSMISSION FAILING. THIS IS DANGEROUS.  *PH *JB    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**768032",
