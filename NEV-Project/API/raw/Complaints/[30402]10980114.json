        "summary": "DURING MODERATE TO HEAVY RAIN, WATER STREAMED INTO THE CAR FROM THE AREA BEHIND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR (WHICH HOUSES THE RADAR SYSTEM). I FIRST NOTICED THE PROBLEM WHILE DRIVING AT APPROX 20 MPH WITH WINDSHIELD WIPERS SET TO MEDIUM, CONTINUOUS. WATER DRIPPED ONTO THE COIN STORAGE AREA IN FRONT OF  THE GEAR PADDLE. MOON ROOF WAS THOROUGHLY CLOSED (AND HAD BEEN REPAIRED IN THE SUMMER AFTER AN EARLIER RECALL).     I PARKED UNDER COVER. A FEW HOURS LATER, I WENT OUT AGAIN. AFTER DRIVING FOR 10 MINUTES, THE PROBLEM REAPPEARED. IT WAS ALMOST AS IF SOME SPACE WAS FILLING UP AND THEN RELEASING A STREAM OF WATER. OR MAYBE IT WAS A STEADY DRIP. WATER COULD HAVE BEEN POOLING IN THE INTELLI-SAFE SYSTEM. AT ONE POINT, I PARKED ON A HILL, CAR FACING DOWNWARD. A LARGE THAN NORMAL TRICKLE OF WATER THEN STREAMED INTO THE CAR. THAT MADE ME THINK THAT THE PROBLEM MIGHT BE WINDSHIELD SEAL. IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT WATER IS GETTING INTO THE MOONROOF IN SOME WAY AND THEN RUNNING TO THE FRONT OF THE CAR AND FINDING ITS WAY DOWN THROUGH THE ELECTRONIC CASING BEHIND THE REARVIEW MIRROR.     I HAVE DRIVEN THE CAR IN THE RAIN BEFORE WITHOUT EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM. THIS WAS A HEAVIER RAIN THAN NORMAL THOUGH.    I HAVE ATTACHED TWO PHOTOS THAT SHOW AREAS DRIPPING. I ALSO HAVE TWO MOVIES FILES WHICH MIGHT BE A BIT MORE HELPFUL. IF YOU WOULD LIKE THOSE, PLEASE CONTACT ME AT [XXX] I CANNOT ATTACH THEM AS FILES.
