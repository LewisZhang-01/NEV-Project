AFTER WAITING FOR THIRTY MINUITES I COULD GET THEM TO OPERATE ON LOW SPEED IN ORDER TO GET HOME. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST PROBLEM I HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH THESE WIPERS.  ON OTHER OCCASSIONS I HAVE TURNED THEM ON TO WIPE INTERMITTENTLY AND THEY GO TO CONSTANT WIPING AND I CANNOT GET THEM TO TURN OFF. I HEARD OF A RECALL, BUT HAVE RECIEVED NO NOTICE OF THIS RECALL AND WHEN INVESTIGATING IT ON THE WEB, I HAVE COME ACROSS SEVERAL POSTINGS WHERE GMC DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELL FAULTY EQUIPMENT. I AM POSTING THIS IN THE HOPES OF GETTING THE PROBLEM FIXED BEFORE THERE IS A SERIOUS CRASH AND LAWSUIT.",
