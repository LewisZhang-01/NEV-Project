        "summary": "I OWN A 1996 DODGE GRAND CARAVAN ES. I BOUGHT IT USED WITH 85000 MILES BACK IN 1999. RECENTLY MY AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON, THEN THE HORN STOPPED WORKING (BUT WOULD SOMETIMES SOUND WHEN MAKING TURNS),  THE CRUISE CONTROL STOPPED FUNCTIONING. THIS WAS OVER A FEW 2-3 MONTH PERIOD THIS PAST SUMMER. I ASKED A MECHANIC ABOUT IT, HE SAID IT WAS A RECALL ITEM FROM DODGE. I CALLED THE DODGE DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT THE VAN, AND THEY SAID \"THEY WERE UNAWARE OF ANY PROBLEM WITH THE ELECTRICAL SPRING\" IN THE STEERING WHEEL. THEY CHARGED ME ABOUT 200.00 TO REPLACE THE PART. YESTERDAY I HEARD ON THE RADIO IT IS A RECALL, SO I WANT TO HEAR IT FROM YOU. IS IT A RECALL? IF IT IS, SHOULD THE DEALERSHIP REFUND MY MONEY THAT WAS SPENT REPLACING THE PART.  I THINK THEY KNEW ABOUT THE PROBLEM/DEFECT ALL ALONG!
