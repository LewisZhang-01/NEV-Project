I CALLED THE EPA AND SPOKE WITH JIM CALDWELL AND HE SAID IT WAS NOT THE GAS. I CALLED THE WI DEPT OF TRANSPORTATION AND JIM CHAJA SAID THAT ANOTHER LADY FROM APPLETON CALLED IN ON MONDAY ABOUT THE SAME THING. SHE WAS GETTING READY TO FILE UNDER THE LEMON LAW. SHE BOUGHT HERS FROM GUSTMAN, I BOUGHT MINE FROM KOLOSSO. TOYOTA CLAIMS THEY STAND BY THEIR RESEARCH AND BELIEVE THE EPA IS WRONG.   *NLM",
