        "summary": "I HAVE BEEN REVIEWING THE FILE ON LINCOLN MARK 8'S '97 & 98 AND NOTICED THAT THERE WERE AT LEAST 10 COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE VENTILATION/HEATING/A/C BLEND DOOR PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR.  HOW MANY COMPLAINTS DOES IT TAKE UNTIL YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT????  THIS IS NOT ONLY A VERY EXPENSIVE REPAIR TO MAKE, BUT FAILURE, WHICH CAN HAPPEN WITHOUT WARNING,  RESULTS IN WINDSHIELD FOGGING AND INABILITY OF THE SYSTEM TO CLEAR THE WINDSHIELD . THE LINCOLNS OF DISTINCTION CLUB, WHICH SUPPORTS MARK 8'S  HAVE HAD OVER 30-40 FAILURES TO DATE, SOME REPEATEDLY.  WE NOW FOUND  THAT THIS FAILURE HAPPENS IN LINCOLN TOWN CAR/ TARAUS, ETC, AND THAT FORD HAS RECENTLY CHANGED THE REPLACEMENT PART DESIGNATION.  THIS STRIKES US AS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, BUT DON'T WANT TO BELLY UP TO THE BAR AND ADMIT IT .  CAN'T YOUR OFFICES DO ANYTHING OR IS THIS JUST A WASTE OF OUR TIME TRYING TO GET A GOVERNMENT AGENCY TO MOVE ON SOMETHING THAT THEY CLAIM THEY WANT TO ASSIST BUT ENDS IN  FRUSTATION OF THE CITIZENS WHO TAKE YOUR CHARTER SERIOUSLY?.",
