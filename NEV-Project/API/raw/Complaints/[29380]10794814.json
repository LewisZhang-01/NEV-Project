WHEN OPERATING WITH NO PASSENGERS LIGHT IS OFF INDICATING THE AIRBAG IS WORKING. I IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT VEHICLE TO MY MECHANIC WHO SCANNED SYSTEM AND COULD OT FIND ANY CODES. AFTER READING SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ON NHTSA REGARDING THIS ISSUE I FEEL NISSAN NEEDS TOIMPLEMENT A SERVICE RECALL. AS I AND I AM SURE OTHERS DO NOT FEEL SAFE OPERATING VEHICLE WITH MY CHILDREN. WE WERE OPERATING SAID VEHICLE ON CITY STREETS UNDER 30 MPH WHEN FIRST NOTICED HOWEVER  THIS PROBLEM IS CONSISTENT ON HIGHWAYS AT HIGHER SPEEDS AS WELL.",
