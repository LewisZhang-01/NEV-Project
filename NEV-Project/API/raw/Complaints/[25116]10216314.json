        "summary": "THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON.  THE CAR WAS NOT RUNNING HOT NOR DID ANY OTHER LIGHT COME ON.  THE ENGINE WAS RUNNING AS SMOOTH AS IT ALWAYS HAS.  I PULLED INTO A PARKING LOT AND LET THE ENGINE COOL.  I SAW THE WATER WAS LOW SO I WENT INSIDE AND GOT WATER TO PUT IN IT.  I TRIED TO START THE CAR AND THE ENGINE WOULD NOT START.  WHITE SMOKE CAME FROM THE EXHAUST.  I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A DEALER.  THEY KNEW WHAT WAS WRONG BEFORE THEY CHECKED THE CAR BECAUSE THEY HAD HAD OTHER CUSTOMERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  AFTER REPLACING THE MANIFOLD, GASKETS, SPARK PLUGS, DEXCOOL, PIPE ASM, SEALS, THERMOSTAT, STARTER, OIL FILTER, OIL, THE CAR RAN AGAIN.  OF COURSE, I WAS OUT $1049.27.  THAT WAS 12 DAYS AGO.  TONIGHT THE CAR BEGAN CLATTERING AND TOMORROW THE CAR WILL GO BACK TO THE DEALER FOR MORE REPAIR.  IT SOUNDS LIKE THE LIFTERS NEED TO BE REPLACED.  I BELIEVE THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECALLED AND REPAIRED BEFORE ALL THE TROUBLE BEGAN.  I WANT MY MONEY BACK.  *TR",
