        "summary": "WHILE MERGING ONTO THE HIGHWAY MY MB C250 WITH 58K MILES SHIFTER SUDDENLY INTO 2ND GEAR. I MOVED ONTO THE SHOULDER AND STOPPED THE CAR. THE ENGINE LIGHT IMMEDIATELY ILLUMINATED. I TURNED THE CAR OFF. WHEN I STARTED IT AGAIN THE LIGHT WAS STILL ON. WHEN I SHIFTED INTO DRIVE THERE WAS A LOUD SOUND AND THE CAR JULTED FORWARD. I SHIFT  BACK IN PARK BUT IT REPEATED THE SOUND AND JERK. I I SHIFTED INTO DRIVE AGAIN (SAME SOUND/JERK) AND PROCEDED AT 30MPH ON THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY TO A GERMAN AUTO REPAIR SHOP CLOSE BY. THEY CHECKED THE ENGINE CODES AND TOLD ME THAT THE ENTIRE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM MUST BE REPLACED. THEY SAID THAT ACCORDING TO THE COMBINATION OF CODES THAT EVERY MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE TRANSMISSION WAS SHOT. THEY SAID THAT THERE IS NO SPECIFIC REASON THIS WOULD HAPPEN BECAUSE MY TRANSMISSION FLUID WAS FULL AND CLEAN AND THE ENGINE DIDNT HAVE ENOUGH MILES FOR SO MANY DIFFERENT PARTS TO HAVE WORN OUT YET. THEY ALSO SAID THEY TO RESET THE COMPUTER BUT THE CAR WENT BACK INTO \"LIMP MODE\" AND ALL CODES CAME BACK. THE TRANSMISSION COST PLUS LABOR IS $4150.  THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY WARRENTEE.     UPON INVESTIGATING THIS MODEL AND THE PERTICULAR TRANSMISSION IN MY CAR (221.9) I FOUND HUNDREDS OF OWNERS WITH THE 221.9 HAVE HAD THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. THIS TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN PUT IN MULTIPLE MB VEHICLES FOR THE PAST DECADE AND RANDOMLY OWNERS REPORT THIER CARS GOING INTO LIMP MODE AND NEEDING NEW TRANSMISSIONS. I BELIEVE MERCEDES HAS NEGLECTED TO RECALL THE PROBLEM BECCAUSE THAT TRANSMISSION IS USED IN SEVERAL MODELS FOR MANY YEARS AND THEY DO JOT WANT TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SO MANY REPAIRS. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE IS ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP MB TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS FAULTY SYSTEM.",
