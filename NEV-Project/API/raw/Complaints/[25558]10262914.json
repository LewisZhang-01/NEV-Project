ON MARCH 21, 2009, THE SES LIGHT CAME ON AND THE TRUCK SOUNDED DIFFERENT RUNNING, BUT DID NOT LOSE POWER.  DIAGNOSTICS SHOWED PROBLEMS WITH THE FUEL INJECTOR MODULE.  ON MARCH 22, 2009, THE SES LIGHT CAME ON AND THE TRUCK STARTED RUNNING ROUGH AND LOST ENGINE POWER (JUST LIKE IT DID ON JANUARY 23).  THE TRUCK HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP AGAIN.  THIS TIME THE #2 FUEL INJECTOR HARNESS HAD SHORTED AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.  WITH BOTH INCIDENTS, THE FUEL INJECTOR HARNESSES WERE REPLACED WITH A NEW HARNESS THAT HAS A 90 DEGREE PLUG AND LONGER WIRES.  THIS IS NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY AND COSTS $400+ TO REPLACE EACH ONE.  WITHIN 2 MONTHS AND 2500 MILES BOTH THE #2 AND #7 FUEL INJECTOR HARNESSES HAVE SHORTED AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.  *TR",
