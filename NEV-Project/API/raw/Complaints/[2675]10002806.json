A ENGINE LIGHT WITH AN 'EXCLAMATION POINT' COMES ON, THE RED LIGHT NEAR THE HAZARDS BUTTON COMES ON, AND THE FUEL LIGHT COMES ON WHILE THIS STALLING HAPPENS. ABOUT TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO THE CAR BEGINNING TO STALL, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT HAD COME ON. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY REPLACED A VALVE (RTC, I THINK) IN THE FUEL SYSTEM AND SAID I NEEDED A NEW FUEL FILTER AND THE FUEL INFECTORS CLEANED, ALL FOR ABOUT $200. I HAD THE FUEL FILTER REPLACED AT AN INDEPENDENT GARAGE AND USED TECHRON FUEL INJECTOR CLEANER IN THE GAS TANK. THE DA I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP, HOWEVER, THE CAR BEGAN TO STALL AND IT COTINUES TO DO SO.",
