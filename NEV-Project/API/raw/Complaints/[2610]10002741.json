IT WAS LIFTED ABOUT 3 INCHES, AND I WAS ATTEMPTING TO HELP HER LIFT IT, WHEN IT SLIPPED OUT OF HER HAND AND SLAMMED SHUT ON MY RIGHT HAND FIRST TWO FINGERS.   IT WAS PULLED SHUT VERY FORCEFULLY BY SOME SORT OF SPRING- LIKE MECHANISM.  MY FINGERS WERE LATCHED INTO THE DOOR WHEN IT CLOSED, RESULTING IN INJURY.  FORTUNATELY, THEY WERE NOT BROKEN AT THE DIP, BUT COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN.  WHAT RESULTED WAS A FLAP TYPE LESION, THAT RESULTED IN ABOUT A ONE INCH GASH IN MY INDEX FINGER, WHICH WILL LEAVE A VERY DISTINCT SCAR.  I THINK THAT THOSE SPRING MECHANISMS SHOULD NOT BE IN THE REAR DOORS.",
