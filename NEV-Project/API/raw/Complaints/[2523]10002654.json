BUT OVERNIGHT THE SAME OVERHEATING APPEARED.  NEXT TIME THE DEALER SAID IT WAS A HEAD GASKET PROBLEM, WHEN FORD WAS CONTACTED TO BE TOLD IT WAS UNDER RECALL TWICE BUT MY CAR COULD NOT BE COVERED DUE TO EXPIRED RECALL WARRANTY (7 YEARS OR 100,000 MILE WHICHEVER COMES FIRST).  I FIXED AND SOLD IT BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO DRIVE A CAR FROM UNRELIABLE MANUFACTURER.",
