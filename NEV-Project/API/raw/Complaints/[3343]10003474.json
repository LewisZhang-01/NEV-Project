THIS HAPPENS UNEXPECTLY WITHOUT WARNING, AND COULD HAPPEN WHILE TRAVELING IN A HIGH SPEED LANE. OVER A HALF MILLION CARS ARE AFFECTED BY THIS POORLY DESIGNED PART. AN INDEPTH REPORT APPEARED IN THE BOSTON SUNDAY GLOBE AUTOMOTIVE SECTION (1-26-03) DESCRIBING THE PROBLEM WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING. VW CHOSES ONLY TO FIX FAILED COMPONENTS, NOT THE ONES THAT HAVE NOT FAILED. THERE ARE FOUR COILS ON THIS ENGINE, AND THE CONSUMER HAS FOUR CHANCES OF BEING IN A ACCIDENT WHEN THE PART FAILS. VW SHOULD REPLACE ALL FOUR PARTS OF THIS KNOWN PROBLEM, AND NOT WAIT FOR THE ACCIDENTS TO HAPPEN.",
