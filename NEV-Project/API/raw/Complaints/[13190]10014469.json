THE ENGINE LOST ALL POWER, THE PARTS WERE REPLACED, THE TRANSMISSION WAS FLUSHED, BUT.... THE VEHICLE STILL DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER THAT IT SHOULD HAVE AND THE TRANSMISSION IS NOT SHIFTING LIKE IT SHOULD, NOW I WAS TOLD THAT WHEN THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER WENT THAT IT SENT PIECES THOUGH THE LINES IN THE CAR, I DID ASK THE DEALER IF THIS WOULD BE CAUSE A PROBLEM WITH THE ENGINE OR THE TRANSMISSION AND THE RESPONSE WAS (IT SHOULDN'T) NOW THIS DOES SOUND LIKE A PROBLEM TO ME.... I WOULD LIKE SOMEONE TO LOOK INTO THIS MATTER AND GIVE ME A REAL ANSWER ON THIS PROBLEM...THE PROBLEM THAT THIS VEHICLE HAD IS KIND OF UNHEARD OF IN THE EARLY STAGE OF MILEAGE AND AGE.. THE DEALERSHIP WAS EVEN CONFUSED ON THE PROBLEM, ALL COMPUTERS THAT THE CAR WAS PLACED ON BY DIFFERENT SHOPS SHOULD NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE CAR, UNTIL IT WAS PUT ON A FLAT BED AND TAKEN TO THE DEALER.... I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HELP YOU CAN GIVE ME IN THIS MATTER....     *NLM",
