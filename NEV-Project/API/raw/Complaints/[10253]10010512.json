BROUGHT IT IN TO THE LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP TO HAVE IT SERVICED DO TO THE \"SERVICE ENGINE SOON\" LIGHT COMING ON.  THEY CHANGED THE OIL AND FILTER, PERFORMED MULTI-POINT INSPECTION, CHANGED THE ENGINE COOLANT AND REPROGRAMMED THE POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE AS PER TSB 97-8-6.  I ALSO HAD THEM ROTATE THE TIRES.  THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THIS CAR AS FAR AS RUNNING (EXCEPT THAT THE SERVICE ENGINE SOON LIGHT WAS ON).  AFTER GETTING THE CAR BACK I NOTICED THAT WHEN I WAS AT A COMPLETE STOP AND WENT TO ACCELERATE THE CAR WAS HAVING A HARD TIME \"GRIPPING THE ROAD\".  CALLED FORD DEALER.  TOOK IN AGAIN.  THEY INFORMED THAT IT WAS THE TRANSMISSION AND THAT IT WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED.  CALLED FORD HEADQUARTERS NO HELP THERE.   THIS CAR WAS ORIGINALLY A LEASED CAR AND WHEN IT WAS PURCHASED BY US IT HAD LOW MILEAGE.  NOT A HAPPY CAMPER!   *NLM",
