I HAVE A 1996 HONDA ACCORD AND IT HAS A HEAD GASKET PROBLEM AND THE ENGINE IS HAVING TO BE REBUILT. THE HEAD GASKET AND ENGINE ARE BADLY WATER DAMAGED AND WARPED, AND IT IS COSTING ME IN EXCESS OF $2,400.00 TO GET IT REPAIRED. I WAS TOLD THAT REPAIRS WERE MADE TO MY CAR BUT NEVER RECEIVED A WORK ORDER PROVING THAT SAID WORK WAS ACTUALLY DONE. I AM TRYING TO SEEK PROTECTION UNDER THE LEMON LAW SO ANY HELP YOU CAN GIVE ME IN THAT EFFORT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED!",
