THE TREAD HAD SEPARATED FROM THE STEEL CORD IN 2 LARGE PIECES AND FLEW BACK AT THE CAR BEHIND ME CAUSING A MAJOR CAR ACCIDENT INVOLVING 3 CARS NOT INCLUDING MINE. IT CAUSED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO MY TRUCK (APPRX. $3,000.00) THE POLICE DID AN ONSITE REPORT AND AFTER SPEAKING TO EVERYONE HAD DECIDED TO LET ME GO WITHOUT A CITATION OR USING MY INSURANCE BECAUSE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE PERSON BEHIND ME CAUSED THE ACCIDENT BY TRYING TO SWERVE AND MISS THE FLYING DEBRIS HITTING HER CAR. I TRIED TO TAKE THEM BACK TO THE STORE WHERE I PURCHASED THEM AND RECEIVED A RESPONSE OF CALL THE MANUFACTURER WHICH I DID WITH NO LUCK. ALL I HAVE AT THIS POINT IS PICTURES BUT NO DOT#.   *JB",
