I COTACTED THE MANUFACTURER AND WAS TOLD THAT THE SMELL IS A BI-PRODUCT OF THE SULFUR IN THE FUEL NOT BEING COMPLETELY BURNED IN THE CONVERTER.  I WAS ASKED TO USE HIGHER OCTANE FUEL AND THAT DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  THE MANUFACTURER IS TELLING THE DEALER THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF THE SITUATION AND THEY ARE INVESTIGATING IT.  I DID NOTICE THE SMELL ON OTHER SEQUOIAS.",
