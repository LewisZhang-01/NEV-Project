THE EMPLOYEE JOE GAVE A WRONG YEAR BUMPER, AND MADE US WAIT FOR OVER 3 WEEKS. I AM IN A RENT A CAR BUSINESS AND EXPLAINED TO JOE THAT I CANNOT LET MY VAN SIT ON THE LOT FOR A LONG TIME. JOE PROMISES TO DELIVER THE BUMPER EVERY DAY SINCE LAST 3 WEEKS AND DOES NOT EVEN REFUND THE $250.00. JUST TODAY WHEN I SENT MY GUY WITH A RECEIPT TO GET THE REFUND THE OWNER OF THE STORE THREATENED TO THROW OUT MY EMPLOYEE OUT OF HIS STORE AND THREATENED ME OVER THE PHONE THAT IF I SEND MY EMPLOYEE EVERY AGAIN HE WILL KICK MY EMPLOYEES ASS AND THROW HIM OUT OF THE STORE. I BELIEVE JOE THE EMPLOYEE IS ON MEDICAL LEAVE AND THE OWNER IS SAYING THAT HE WILL NOT REFUND ANY MONEY TO ANYBODY AND THAT I SHOULD FORGET ABOUT MY MONEY. WE HAVE ALREADY RETURNED THE WRONG BUMPER BACK. PLEASE HELP IN DISCIPLINING THE OWNER AND HIS EMPLOYEE AND HELP ME IN GETTING MY $250.00 BACK. *JB",
