WHILE ACCELERATING TO MERGE TO THE HIGHWAY TRAFFIC/SPEED, THE ENGINE LOST POWER AND NOT RESPONSE TO PRESSING ON THE GAS PEDAL. MY WIFE HAD TO STEER THE CAR BACK TO THE SHOULDER TO AVOID ACCIDENT.    THIS CAR IS SERVICE BY FORD DEALER UNDER PURCHASED MAINTENANCE PLAN SINCE WE BOUGHT IT NEW. THERE WAS NO MENTION TO SERVICE THE INTAKE/THROTTLE BODY ASSEMBLY, WHICH IS NOT SERVICEABLE.    I UNDERSTAND THIS CAR SHARE SAME PLATFORM WITH FORD ESCAPE WHICH HAD A RECALL ON THE THROTTLE BODY ASSEMBLY LAST YEAR. I WONDER THIS CAR MODE SHOULD BE RECALLED TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  *TR",
