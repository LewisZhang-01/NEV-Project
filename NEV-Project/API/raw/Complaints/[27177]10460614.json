HAVE NOTED THIS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM ON THIS VEHICLE (MAKE, MODEL, YEAR) AS THERE ARE MANY MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.  WILL BE CONTACTING A LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER FOR DIAGNOSIS AND REPAIR, BUT AM AFRAID I MAY HAVE TO PAY A LOT OF MONEY FOR THIS REPAIR AFTER I RESEARCH THIS PROBLEM IN DETAIL.  *TR",
