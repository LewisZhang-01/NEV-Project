AFTER ALLTHAT IT WAS STILL JERKING AND IT IS MY ALTERNATOR. I DROVE MY NISSAN OFF THE LOT WITH 298 MILES ON IT AND THE TRANSMISSION IS SLIPPING. I CALLED NISSAN AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD NOT COVER IT BECAUSE IM AT 101K MILES EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THE SECURITY +PLUS CONTRACT AND THERE IS A STIPULATION WITH KENTCUKY. THERE SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY NO REASON AS TO WHY A 6 YEAR OLD CAR IS HAVING SO MANY ISSUES ALL OF A SUDDEN. IT LITERRALY STARTED A MONTH AGO AND IS DUE TO BE PAID OFF IN JULY. WHEN I PULL OFF FROM STATIONARY SITTING IT JERKS, ONCE I COAST TO A GOOD SPEED AROUND 50MPH AND UP THEN IT WONT JERK BUT HESITATES AND MY RPM GAUGE JUMPS UP AND DOWN.",
