THE DEALER FOUND IT AND SAID IT SHOULD BE FIXED OR REPLACED FOR A NOMINAL FEE ($750).  I ELECTED NOT TO HAVE IT DONE AT THAT TIME.  THIS WAS ABOUT A YEAR AGO.  AFTER FURTHER DISCUSSION WITH THE SERVICEMAN ABOUT THIS HE STATED TO ME THAT IT IS A DESIGN PROBLEM AND THAT THEY HAVE REPAIRED OR REPLACED MANY OF THEM.   MY QUESTION IS IF IT IS A DESIGN PROBLEM AND THE MANUFACTURER IS AWARE OF IT, THEN THEY SHOULD REPLACE OR REPAIR IT FREE OF CHARGE.  WHAT CAN BE DONE TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM?  AM I ENTITLED TO A FREE REPLACEMENT OF THE PART? PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE RECEIVED ANY OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS?  I AM NOT SURE OF THE DATE BUT HAD TO PUT SOMETHING IN THE INCIDENT DATE FIELD.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.  REGARDS, DARL M. DODSON,   E-MAIL BDODFON@WPA.NET.    *NLM",
