I HAVE NOT WAY OF KNOWING HOW LONG THIS WILL LAST.  IF MY OTHER SIDE GOES OUT I AM FACING ANOTHER EXPENSE OF REPLACING IT SINCE IT IS THE LAW TO DRIVE WITH HEAD LIGHTS ON WHEN RAINING OR THROUGH A CONSTRUCTION ZONE HERE IN PA. WHY SHOULD I AS A CONSUMER HAVE TO PAY SUCH A HIGH COST TO REPAIR THESE LIGHTS.  IF I HAD KNOWN OF THIS PROBLEM I WOULD HAVE MADE SURE THAT I DID NOT BUY ONE OF THESE CARS,MADE IN JAN. THROUGH MARCH. I FEEL FORD SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE OF ITS DESIGN FLAW.   *NLM",
