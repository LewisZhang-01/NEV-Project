        "summary": "MY LATE 1999 TOYOTA ECHO WAS PARKED AFTER A SHORT DRIVE. TWO AND A HALF HOURS LATER IT BURST INTO FLAMES. THE CAR WAS COMPLETELY DESTROYED AND A LARGE AREA OF MY HOME WAS BURNED. I AND MY NIECE WERE ASLEEP UPSTAIRS. NO ONE WAS INJURED. THE SMELL OF SMOKE WOKE US. WHEN WE FIRST SAW THE CAR, A COLUMN OF WHITE FIRE WAS SHOOTING UP THROUGH THE WINDSCREEN TO THE CEILING 11 FEET ABOVE. THE FIRE CAME FROM THE CENTER OF THE CONSOLE/DASH AREA. AT THAT TIME THERE WERE NO FLAMES AROUND OR UNDER THE CAR. JUST THE COLUMN OF FLAME FROM THE CENTER. THE HORN WAS SOUNDING. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND POLICE ARRIVED WITHIN 10 MINUTES AND CONFIRMED THAT THE FIRE WAS SEATED IN THE CENTRAL DASH AREA.   THE KEYS WERE BESIDE BY BED. THE CAR HAD ONLY BEEN SERVICED BY TOYOTA SERVICE CENTERS AND THERE WERE NO MODIFICATIONS TO THE CAR. WHEN TOYOTA WERE NOTIFIED, THEY SENT INVESTIGATORS TO LOOK FOR A RELAY NEAR THE ALTERNATOR. THE RESULTS OF MY INSURANCE', TOYOTA'S AND AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATOR'S INVESTIGATIONS WERE (AS RELAYED TO ME BY PHONE) UNSPECIFIED FIRE STARTING IN THE DASH.  *JB",
