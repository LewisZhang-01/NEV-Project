THEN TWO DAYS LATER I WAS DRIVING AND THE STEERING WHEEL WAS JERKING AROUND A LITTLE, FEELING LIKE IT WAS STICKING THEN RELEASING.THE MOVEMENT WAS OCCURRING IN BOTH DIRECTIONS. I THEN STOPPED AND TURNED OFF THE CAR FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. WHEN I RESTARTED THE STEERING WAS VERY, VERY HARD TO MOVE. I TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE AND RESTARTED, THE STEERING WAS EASIER, BUT THERE WAS NOTICEABLE MOVEMENT IN THE WHEEL WHILE STILL PARKED.   I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MY LOCAL FORD DEALER AND THEY WERE WELL AWARE OF THE PROBLEM. THE SERVICE REP STATED THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE A STEERING COLUMN REPLACEMENT TO FIX FOR APPROX $1500.  I WAS QUIT SURPRISED THAT THE SERVICE REP WAS SO FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEM UNTIL IN TALKING WITH THE REP. THEY STATED THAT THEY HAD ANOTHER ESCAPE IN THEIR SERVICE DEPT. AND THAT VEHICLE THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING HAD FAILED AND IT REQUIRES A NEW STEERING COLUMN ALSO. THE REP. ALSO ELUDED TO IT AS BEING A FAIRLY COMMON PROBLEM. (NOT THAT YOU CARE BUT IT'S NOT EVEN COVERED BY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY I PAID SO DEARLY FOR).  *TR",
