        "summary": "MY 1997  C-5 CORVETTE HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKING UP.  THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPEN WHEN MY WIFE HAD IT AT WORK, WHEN SHE WENT TO LEAVE SHE STARTED OUT BUT COULD NOT STEER. THE DASHBOARD READER DISPLAY SAID \"COLUMN FAILURE\". WHEN CHECKING THE OWNERS MANUAL WE FOUND \"COLUMN FAILURE\" AND IT SAID TO HAVE VEHICLE TOWED TO REPAIR SHOP FOR SERVICE.  THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED AT MY EXPENSE BECAUSE GENERAL MOTORS WOULD NOT ADMIT TO A PROBLEM.  THERE IS AN ACTIVE RECALL FOR 1998-2002 C-5 CORVETTES FOR STEERING COLUMN LOCKUP, BUT THEY SAID THAT MINE WAS CAUSED BY A DIFFERENT PART AND THEY WOULD NOT HONOR THE RECALL.  ON TUESDAY 10 JUNE THE STEERING COLUMN LOCKED UP AGAIN THIS TIME WHILE MY WIFE WAS DRIVING.  SHE HAD JUST PULLED INTO TRAFFIC AND HEARD A CLICK AT WHICH TIME  THE STEERING LOCKED UP.  FORTUNATELY SHE WAS ABLE TO STOP WITHOUT INCIDENT.  THE CAR HAD TO SIT PART WAY IN THE ROAD UNTIL A WRECKER WAS DISPATCHED TO TOW IT IN AGAIN.  THE SERVICE DEALER HAS HAD THE CAR SINCE THAT TIME AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHEN OR IF IT WILL BE FIXED.   *JB  REF. IN EA02-031 *CJS",
