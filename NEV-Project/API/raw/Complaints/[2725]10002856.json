THE CAR ACTED LIKE THE POWER STEERING UNIT QUIT OR WOULD ONLY ALLOW YOU TO TURN TO THE RIGHT. IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE WE COULD NOT STEER THE VEHICLE ANYMORE. WE HAD IT REPAIRED AT A COST OF $1500. I THEN LEARNED OF A CAMPAIGN, #02V286000, THAT LISTED THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT MY CAR WAS HAVING. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU COULD ISSUE A RECALL FOR THAT VEHICLE OR IF MY CAR WAS ACTUALLY COVERED FOR THIS POSSIBLE RECALL.
