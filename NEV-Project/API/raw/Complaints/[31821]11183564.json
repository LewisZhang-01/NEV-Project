IF A LEADING CAR MAKES AN ABRUPT STOP, THE FRONT ASSIST SYSTEM APPLIES INSTANT HEAVY BRAKING EVEN WHEN THE DRIVER IS ALREADY BRINGING THE CAR TO A SMOOTH STOP AT A SAFE DISTANCE.  THIS DOUBLE-BRAKING RESULTS IN UNEXPECTED SKIDDING AND RISKS A REAR-END COLLISION WITH FOLLOWING CARS.    THE MANUAL OVERRIDE TO FRONT ASSIST IS PRESSING HARD ON THE GAS PEDAL.  THIS ACTION CAN'T BE PERFORMED WHEN THE DRIVER IS ALREADY BRINGING THE CAR TO A STOP.",
