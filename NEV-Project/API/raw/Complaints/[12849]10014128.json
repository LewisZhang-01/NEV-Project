        "summary": "READ BOTTOM TO GET SAFETY CONCERN:  CALLED FORD THIS MORNING, AND VERBALLY INFORMED THEM OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE ROTORS ON MY F350, AND THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD CALL BACK THE NEXT DAY.  RECEIVED A CALL IN 2 HOURS AND WAS INFORMED THAT THE ONLY THING THAT FORD CAN DO IS RESURFACE WARPED ROTORS UNLESS THE ROTORS DO NOT MEET FORD??S SPECIFICATION.  I AM SURE THAT THE ONLY SPECIFICATION IS ON THICKNESS, AND I AM SURE THAT SINCE THE PADS STILL HAVE 10MM THE ROTORS ARE GOING TO BE THICK ENOUGH TO BE TURNED OR RESURFACED.  WHEN THE SURFACE OF THE ROTOR IS RESURFACED A LAYER OF THE METAL IS SHAVED OFF LEAVING LESS METAL ON THE ROTOR, PUT A DIFFERENT WAY THINNER ROTOR WALLS.  THE THINNER THE ROTOR WALL, THE FASTER THE ROTOR WILL HEAT UP, AND HEAT CAUSES THE DEFECTIVE ROTORS TO WARP.  IF DEFECTIVE ROTORS ARE TURNED THEY WILL WARP AGAIN, AND THEY WILL WARP IN LESS SEVERE CONDITIONS THAN THE FIRST TIME WHEN THEY WERE THICKER.  THE OPERATOR ON THE PHONE WAS NOT TECHNICAL AND THE DISCUSSION WENT ON DEAF EARS.  I ALSO TOLD THE OPERATOR THAT THIS DEFECT IS A SAFETY CONCERN DUE TO THE FACT THAT IF I AM GOING DOWN A HILL AND HAVE TO PUT ON MY BRAKES AND HIT A SLICK AREA IN THE ROAD, THERE IS A MUCH GREATER POSSIBILITY OF LOSING CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE THAN IF THE BRAKES WERE FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.  THIS FACT COMBINED WITH THE FACT THAT TURNED ROTORS WOULD WARP AT A GREATER RATE AND MORE QUICKLY, LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT FORD IS ENCOURAGING THE DEALERS TO PLACE POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS, DEFECTIVE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD.    MY F350 HAS 21500 MILES, AND IS UNDER WARRANTY.  I HAVE RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM AND FOUND THAT FORD HAS DONE THIS TO A LOT OF SUPER DUTY TRUCKS AND THEY ARE ALL OUT ON THE ROAD WITH DEFECTIVE BRAKES.  4/8/03 SENT THE DOCUMENT TO FORD WITH UPDATES.   *NLM",
