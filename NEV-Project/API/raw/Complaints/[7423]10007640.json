TOOK TO DEALERSHIP, WHO INDICATES IT IS OIL SLUDGE DUE TO FAILURE TO CHANGE OIL.  OIL HAS BEEN CHANGED EVERY 4000 MILES.  GETTING NO SATISFACTION AT THIS POINT FROM DEALER, WHO INDICATES MINIMUM REPAIR COST WILL BE $3300 - $3500 FOR REBUILT ENGINE.  MADE COMPLAINT TO TOYOTA CORPORATE, WHO ALSO ARE NOT PROVIDING ASSISTANCE.  GETTING RUN AROUND AS COMPLAINT WAS FILED, WHICH THEY ARE SENDING BACK TO REGIONAL OFFICE FOR HANDLING.  REGIONAL OFFICE ALREADY INDICATED THAT THEY PROBABLY AREN'T OFFERING ANY ASSISTANCE.      ENGINE HAS LESS THAN 65,000 MILES ON IT.  BOUGHT IT ONE YEAR OLD WITH 29,000 ON IT.  THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS CAR TO HAVE ENGINE TROUBLE WITH LESS THAN 65,000 MILES ON IT.  ONLY 35,000 MILES HAVE BEEN PUT ON THE CAR IN LAST 6 YEARS.    TOYOTA NEEDS TO STICK BY THEIR PRODUCT, AND MAKE REPAIRS THAT ARE REQUIRED.  CONSUMERS AT BEING PLACED IN VERY POOR POSITION, AND WE ARE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.",
