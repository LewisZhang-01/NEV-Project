THE BIKE SUDDENLY SHUT OFF WITH NO WARNING IN A LONG SWEEPING BLIND CORNER.  THERE WAS NO SHOULDER AND I WAS FORCED TO PULL OFF INTO THE TALL BRUSH.   I COULD NOT GET THE BIKE STARTED AGAIN, I HAD TO PUSH IT BACK ABOUT 1/2 MILE DOWN THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY TO THE NEXT CLOSEST TURN OUT TO ATTEMPT REPAIRS.   I ENDED UP ABANDONING THE BIKE AND COMING BACK LATER TO RETRIEVE IT WITH MY TRUCK.  UPON LATER INVESTIGATION THE CDI UNIT THAT CONTROLS THE SPARK FIRING AND TIMING HAD FAILED.  LUCKILY THIS OCCURRED MID DAY ON A MONDAY AND TRAFFIC WAS AT A MINIMUM BUT DUE TO THE LOCATION AND THE SPEED OFF PASSING TRAFFIC IT WAS STILL A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION.",
