IT FEELS LIKE THERE IS A MAGNET ON BOTH SIDES OF CENTER PULLING YOU ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. IT SEEMS TO BE TEMPERATURE RELATED. ONCE THE CAR GETS WARM, OR THE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE GETS WARMER, THE PROBLEM IS NOT AS PRONOUNCED. AUDI SAYS THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO. THIS IS A CONCERN WHEN DRIVING WHEN IT IS COLD AND ICY OUT. PULLING SIDE TO SIDE SEEMS LIKE A SAFETY CONCERN. APPEARS TO BE WIDESPREAD ACROSS MODELS THAT USE THIS NEW ELECTRONIC STEERING MECHANISM.  *TR",
