ONCE THE VEHICLE SETS OVERNIGHT OR A PERIOD OF SIX HOURS OR LONGER THE FOLLOWING PROBLEM OCCURS: I GO TO BACK OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY IN REVERSE THE VEHICLE ENGINE WILL DIE. NOTE THAT MY DRIVE WAY IS ON AN INCLINE. THIS CANNOT BE RECREATED IF THE DEALERSHIP ATTACHES A TECH TOOL TO THE VEHICLE. THIS PROBLEM CAN BE RECREATED WITHOUT FAIL WITH NOTHING ATTACHED. I HAVE ALSO HAD ONE OCCURRENCE THAT AFTER I STARTED THE VEHICLE BACK, WHICH IT WILL ALWAYS START BACK, I WAS ATTEMPTING TO PULL OUT ON A MAJOR ROAD WHEN THE VEHICLE APPEARED TO TRY AND STALL OUT. LUCKILY THE VEHICLE PICKED BACK UP AND RESPONDED NORMALLY JUST A SECOND BEFORE I WAS NEARLY STRUCK BROADSIDE BY A SEMI-TRUCK. THE DATE BELOW IS APPROXIMATELY WHEN THE PROBLEM STARTED.  *JB",
