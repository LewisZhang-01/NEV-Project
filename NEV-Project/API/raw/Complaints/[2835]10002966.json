IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BRING THE CAR OVER 25 MILES PER HOUR, EVEN ON THE HIGHWAY.  AFTER A FEW MINUTES, THE CAR WAS SMOKING AND SMELLED BAD.  THE VOLKSWAGEN DEALER TOLD US THAT LOTS OF CARS, PARTICULARLY THE ONES WITH 1.8T ENGINES, ARE HAVING THIS FAILURE.  HE SAID THAT VOLKSWAGEN IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT THAT THE PART IS ON A NATIONAL BACKORDER.  OUR CAR WAS IN THE SHOP FOR ALMOST THREE WEEKS.",
