THE DRIVER COMPLETELY COLLAPSED THE BAG, HITTING HIS HEAD ON THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE PASSENGER BAG WAS ABOVE AVERAGE BUT SEEMED TOO AGGRESSIVE CAUSING THE PASSENGER TO WHIP LASH BACK TOWARDS THE SEAT. A GREAT PASSENGER OCCUPANCY DURING THE TEST AND OVERALL EXCELLENT TRUCK. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.  *TR",
