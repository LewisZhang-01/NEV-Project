UPON PHONING THE DEALERSHIP, I FOUND THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE 20 OTHER CARS ON THEIR LOT WITH THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM WAITING FOR REPLACEMENT PARTS THAT ARE ON NATIONAL BACKORDER. IN ORDER TO APPEASE THEIR CUSTOMERS, THE DEALER HAD BEEN PULLING THE PART OUT OF 2003 MODELS, BUT THEY RAN OUT OF CARS TO CANNIBALIZE. I HAVE FURTHER LEARNED THAT THIS IS A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM IN LATE MODEL VW'S AS WELL AS AUDI'S WITH THE 1.8L ENGINE, AND ALTHOUGH VW IS AWARE OF THE DEFECT, THEY HAVE NOT AUTHORIZED THEIR DEALERS TO REPLACE THE OTHER THREE COIL PACKS. ALSO, WHILE MY CAR COULD POTENTIALLY BREAK DOWN THREE MORE TIMES BECAUSE OF THIS DEFECTIVE PART, THERE IS CURRENTLY NO RECALL SCHEDULED BY VOLKSWAGEN.",
