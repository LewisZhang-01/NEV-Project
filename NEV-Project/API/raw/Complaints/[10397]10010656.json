        "summary": "WHEN DOORS ARE CLOSED THE DOME LIGHT, DOOR AJAR LIGHT, AND EXTERIOR LIGHT ABOVE TRUCK BED REMAIN ON.  THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN RECURRING FOR THE LAST 3-4 YEARS.  I HAVE ASKED DIFFERENT REPAIR SHOPS CONCERNING THE PROBLEM AND GET MANY REPLIES FROM BAD DOOR SWITCH, BAD RELAY SWITCH TO IT'S A RECURRING PROBLEM WITH 1998 FORD F-150'S AND YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT.  THE LIGHTS CAN STAY ON FOR 1 MINUTE OR 30 MINUTES, OCCASIONALLY I HAVE TO REMOVE THE FUSE.  THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO OCCUR MOST FREQUENTLY WHEN THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE GOES FROM COLD TO WARMER WEATHER.  I HAVE DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM WITH OTHER OWNERS AND THEY ALL SEEM TO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.  IT IS ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS AT NIGHT BECAUSE OF THE INTERIOR LIGHT REMAINING ON.  I AM ALSO CONCERNED WITH WEAR ON THE BATTERY.  I FEEL THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW AND MANUFACTURER SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THE REPAIR.      *JB",
