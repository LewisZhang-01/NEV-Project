FIGURED IT WAS A WHEEL BEARING THAT WAS WORN, WHICH IS WHAT IT WAS, BUT IN LOOKING AT THAT ISSUE SAW THAT REAR PASSENGER COIL SPRING WAS BROKEN. VEHICLE STANCE DID NOT INDICATE A BROKEN SPRING. CHECKED THE DRIVER SIDE TO BE SAFE AND NOTED THAT REAR SPRING WAS BROKEN IN TWO PLACES AND LOOKED AS IF IT WAS TO COME OFF THE BOTTOM SPRING/STRUT CUSHION.  AS A RESULT OF THIS MECHANIC INDICATED BROKEN SPRINGS HAD CREATED PREMATURE WEAR OF REAR TOE LINKS.  I AM CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR REPLACEMENT PARTS.  THIS VEHICLE HAS SEEN NO OFF-ROAD USE OR BEEN USED TO CARRY HEAVY CARGO LOADS.  LADY DRIVEN ONLY.  *TR",
