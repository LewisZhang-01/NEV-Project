AND THE CAR INFRONT OF ME LOST CONTROL. IN ORDER TO AVOID HITTING IT I HAD TO MAKE A SHARP LEFT HAND TURN. WHILE MAKING THIS LEFT HAND TURN I HAD MY POWER STEERING DISSENGAGE. MY DASHBOARD LIGHTS ALL THEN LIT UP AND THE ENGINE AND ALL THE VEHICLES POWER WENT DEAD. I ENDED UP GOING OFF THE ROAD AND WAS AIRBORNE AND CAME FLYING DOWN INTO THE METAL HIGHWAY DIVIDER. CAUSING SEVERE DAMAGE TO THE FRONT END OF MY CAR AND MINOR DAMAGEIN THE REAR. THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY AND THERE WERE NO SERIOUS INJURIES.

I THEN CONTACTED PONTIAC CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE CENTER BEFORE THE ACCIDENT AND THEY DIDNT OFFER ANY HELP EITHER.",
