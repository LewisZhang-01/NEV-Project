        "summary": "I BOUGHT THIS CAR NEW AND HAS ABOUT 85000 MILES ON IT AND TOOK IT IN BECAUSE OF AIRBAG LIGHT BEING ON. I WAS TOLD PASSENGER PRESENT SENSOR NEEDS TO BE REPLACED WHICH CAUSES AIRBAG LIGHT TO REMAIN ON WHEN CAR IS MOVING. THIS IS RIDICULOUS I LOOKED ABOUT THIS CLAIM AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF CAMAROS WITH THIS EXACT SAME ISSUE. THIS IS A $700 REPLACEMENT AND DOES NOT SIT WELL WITH ME AS I'VE ALWAYS BOUGHT CHEVYS AND NOT HAD ISSUES BEFORE. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND IF I HAVE TO PAY $700 TO FIX A SAFETY ISSUE THAT WAS DEFECTIVE WITH THIS VEHICLE AND SEVERAL HUNDRED OTHERS THEN THIS IS A MANUFACTURE DEFECT THAT SHOULD NOT FALL ON CONSUMER TO GET IT REPLACED. LET ME KNOW WHAT CAN BE DONE HERE! THANKS  *TR",
