THE REAR INSIDE TRIM PANEL HAD TO BE BROKEN BECAUSE OF A POOR DESIGN TO GET TO CHEAP PLASTIC ACTUATOR UNIT TO RELEASE THE REAR WINDOW AND TAILGATE.  COSTLY REPAIR NOT UNDER WARRANTY. COULD POSE SAFETY PROBLEM IF IT WAS THE ONLY ESCAPE ROUTE IN CAR CRASH.  I FEEL GM SHOULD  AT LEAST COVER PARTS REPAIR SINCE THE ONLY WAY TO REPLACE THE PROBLEM IS TO BREAK A $145.00 + TRIM PANEL BECAUSE THE SCREWS FOR THAT PANEL ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE TAILGATE WHICH YOU CAN'T GET OPEN TO UNSCREW THEM.  I THINK THIS IS PROBLEM WHICH GM REFUSES TO ADDRESS AND LIKE I SAID IS A COSTLY PROBLEM FOR THE CONSUMER.    *NLM",
