MY BOAT & TRAILER IS 3200 LBS AND TONGUE WEIGHT 280 LBS., WELL WITHIN SPECS.  MY FIRST TRIP TRAILERING 20 MILES TO THE LAKE THE VEHICLE THEN TRAILER SWERVED, SINCE THE WEIGHT PUSHES THE REAR DOWN & FRONT END UP SO THAT LITTLE WEIGHT REMAINS ON THE FRONT TO CONTROL STEERING. THE FORD ENGINEER CONSULTED SAID \"IF HE BOUGHT THE EXPLORER TO TRAILER WHY DIDN'T HE BUY THE 4 DOOR\" (IMPLYING IT HAS A LONGER WHEEL BASE & IS MORE STABLE. THE SERVICE DIRECTOR & SHOP FOREMAN AT THE DEALER AGREED THAT THE FRONT END IS TOO HIGH TO BE SAFE BUT FORD REFUSES TO TAKE ANY ACTION TO CORRECT.   NLM",
