        "summary": "OUR TRANSMISSION ON OUR FORD 2000 EXCURSION KEEPS GOING OUT. ON DANGEROUS TWO LANE MOUNTAIN ROADS WHERE THE VEHICLE TAKES UP THE ENTIRE LANE AND I ALWAYS HAVE CHILDREN IN THE CAR.  I AM ON MY THIRD TRANSMISSION AND MY THREE YEAR OLD SON NOW ASKS IF THE CAR IS GOING TO BREAK DOWN EACH AND EVERYTIME WE GET INTO THE VEHICLE.  I'M AFRAID TO GO ANYWHERE.  THE PROBLEM IS THIS AS I SEE IT.  THE CLUTCH ON THE FAN THAT COOLS THE TRANSMISSION KICKS ON AT 40 MPH, ALSO THE COOLER IS TOO SMALL FOR THE SIZE OF ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION, AND I'M TIRED OF PUTTING AFTER MARKET EQUIPMENT ON A VEHICLE THAT I PAID SO MUCH FOR.  ON MOUNTAINOUS TWO LANE ROADS YOU NEVER GET THE VEHICLE UP TO 40 MPH THUS MAKING THE VEHICLE LABOR AND RUN HOT, THUS CAUSING THE TRANSMISSION TO BOIL AND FALL APART INSIDE.  THE ENGINEERS SHOULD KNOW OF THIS PROBLEM IT IS WITH THE DIESEL ENGINE THAT THIS OCCURS.  I HAVE A FRIEND WITH AN F250, SAME CHASSIS AS MY EXCURSION AND HE IS ON HIS FIFTH TRANSMISSION.  MY FEAR IS TWOFOLD, THAT I WILL BREAK DOWN AGAIN ON THESE DANGEROUS MOUNTAIN ROADS AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT, ALSO MY VEHICLE WILL SOON BE OUT OF WARRANTY ALLOWING FORD TO BE OFF THE HOOK.  I STILL HAVE TO PAY FOR MY EXPENSIVE VEHICLE WHETHER IT PERFORMS OR NOT AND I FEEL THIS IS A SEVERE PROBLEM AND SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE RECTIFIED, WE PAID A LOT FOR THIS VEHICLE TO BE PERFORMING SO POORLY.    *NLM",
