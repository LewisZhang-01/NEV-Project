HE SUGGESTED I CONTACT THE DEALERSHIP. I CONTACTED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF JACK POWELL CHRYSLER PLYMOUTH DODGE, ESCONDIDO, CA WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR NEW IN SEPT 1999, AND TOLD THEM ABOUT MY HEAD GASKET OIL LEAK. THEY ASKED ME FOR MY VIN NUMBER. I WAITED 15 MINUTES FOR A WOMAN TO RETURN TO THE PHONE AND SAID THERE WAS NO RECALLS FOR MY VEHICLE, THEN HUNG UP ON ME WHEN I STARTED TO ASK A QUESTION. I TOLD MY MECHANIC ABOUT THE INCIDENT, AND HE STATED HE HAD ANOTHER CUSTOMER WITH THE SAME HEAD GASKET LEAKING ON THEIR NEON AND PLYMOUTH REPAIRED IT. MY NEON REMAINS RELIABLE, AS LONG AS I PUT 1.5 QUARTS OF OIL IN IT EVERY WEEK.   *NLM",
