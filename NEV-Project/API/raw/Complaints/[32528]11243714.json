THE ISSUE BEGAN SHORTLY AFTER I HAD THE DEALER ADDRESS A SAFETY RECALL 19S07; WHICH HAS TO DO WITH A FAILURE OF THE OUTPUT SPEED SENSOR. AS THE VEHICLE HAD SHIFTED INTO FIRST GEAR UNEXPECTEDLY. THERE IS A COMPLIANCE RECALL 12C23 DATED MAY 30, 2012 WHICH ADDRESSES THE EXACT SAME ISSUES I AM EXPERIENCING:    ' TRANSMISSION WILL NOT ENGAGE INTO REVERSE GEAR  ' ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION PRNDL INDICATOR DOES NOT DISPLAY REVERSE (IF EQUIPPED)  ' BACK-UP LAMPS ARE INOPERATIVE  ' INTERMITTENT REAR VIDEO CAMERA OPERATION   WHEN I CONTACTED FORD, THEY VERIFIED MY TRUCK WAS MANUFACTURED IN MAY 2011; WHICH WAS BEFORE THE TERMS OF THE COMPLIANCE RECALL COVERING THE PERIOD COVERING OCTOBER 2011 - FEBRUARY 2012. YET MY TRUCK IS HAVING THE EXACT SAME ISSUES REFLECTED IN THE COMPLIANCE RECALL. I BELIEVE THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED UNDER THE COMPLIANCE RECALL 12C23. AS IT IS THE EXACT SAME ISSUE I AM EXPERIENCING AND WAS MANUFACTURED A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THE RECALL DATE RANGE AND WAS MANUFACTURED AT THE SAME MANUFACTURING FACILITY LISTED. FORD DID OPEN A FILE AND ISSUED A CASE NUMBER BUT I BELIEVE THIS IS AN ISSUE NHTSA SHOULD BE AWARE OF.",
