        "summary": "MY VEHICLE HAS AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE WITH THE POWER WINDOWS AND THE RADIO. THE POWER WINDOWS WILL STOP WORKING IF I TRY TO ADJUST THEM TO THE PERFECT HEIGHT FOR ME, FORCING ME TO HAVE TO PRESS BUTTONS ON ANOTHER WINDOW IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO THE WINDOW THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADJUST. THIS PROBLEM IS PRESENT IN ALL FOUR WINDOWS.    THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS THAT THE CAR HAS SOME SORT OF POWER ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE CHEVROLET DEALERSHIPS THAT I HAVE TAKEN IT TO BUT IT STILL HAS NOT BEEN FIXED. IN THE MIDDLE OF DRIVING THE CAR LOSES POWER AND WILL NOT MOVE FORWARD AT A REGULAR PACE AND BEGINS TO STRUGGLE TO MOVE FORWARD WHILE THE RPM'S BUILD UP BRINGING IT CLOSE TO REDLINING. AT THAT POINT IT WILL BEGIN TO MOVE AND JERK WHEN IT FINALLY SHIFTS INTO GEAR AND WILL DO IT A SECOND TIME IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FIRST JERK AND BEGIN TO DRIVE NORMAL. IT HAS NEARLY KILLED MY PREGNANT WIFE AND MYSELF MULTIPLE TIMES. IT HAS NEARLY GOTTEN MY YOUNGER COUSIN AND I KILLED ON THE EXPRESSWAY BY STRUGGLING TO DRIVE WHILE PLACING IN THE PATH OF A ONCOMING SEMI. WE BROUGHT THE CAR IN LATE DECEMBER OF 2018 AND THE PROBLEMS STARTED ABOUT A FEW DAYS SHORT OF A WEEK INTO THE NEW YEAR. THIS CAR IS DANGEROUS AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE DRIVERS OF THE CHEVY CRUZE EXPERIENCING SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES.",
