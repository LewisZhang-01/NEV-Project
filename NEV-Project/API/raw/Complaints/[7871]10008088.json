THEN I BEGAN TO SMELL GASOLINE FUMES IN THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT OF THE CAR WHILE DRIVING, AND ALSO OUTSIDE THE CAR AFTER GETTING OUT.  I TOOK THE CAR TO A REPUTABLE MECHANIC.  HE STATED THAT THE FUEL RAIL SEAL IS LEAKING AT THE FUEL INJECTOR AND THAT HE HAS SEEN THIS FREQUENTLY BEFORE.   THERE IS ALREADY A RECALL FOR THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM ON 1996 - 1999 AND SOME 2000 DODGE CARAVANS, BUT WHEN I CALLED CHRYSLER THEY REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING.  I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE THIS IS AN OBVIOUS FIRE HAZARD.  MY VEHICLE HAS ONLY 59,890 MILES ON IT.*JB",
