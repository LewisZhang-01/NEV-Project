I HAD IT TOWED TO A CHRYSLER DEALER. THEY TOLD ME I WAS USING A KEY THAT FRIED A COMPUTER CHIP. IT WAS A KEY I RECEIVED FROM THE DEALER WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR. I HAD USED THAT SPARE KEY BEFORE. NOW ON OCCASION THE ENGINE WILL JUST SHUT OFF, NOT STALL OR ANYTHING. IT HAS HAPPENED AS I WAS STARTING FIRST THING IN THE MORNING, AT A STOP LIGHT OR AS I AM TRAVELING DOWN THE HIGHWAY. I HAVE TO PULL OVER AND TRY TO RESTART. SOMETIMES IT WILL START RIGHT UP AND AT OTHER TIMES IT WILL START 10 MINUTES LATER.*JB",
