THE RUST APPEARS TO BE ORIGINATING FROM INSIDE THE SUPPORTS, AND I WAS ADVISED BY A TOYOTA DEALER MECHANIC THAT THE RUST COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO COMPLETE FRAME FAILURE IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE. AT THIS POINT, SIZABLE AREAS HAVE RUSTED THROUGH ENTIRELY.    I HAVE BROUGHT THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF TOYOTA, AND THEY HAVE REGULARLY REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS ANY PROBLEM WITH THE FRAME.",
