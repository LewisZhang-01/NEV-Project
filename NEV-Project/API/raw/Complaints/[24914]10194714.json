THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THAT I HAD TO PURCHASE A FUEL COMPOSITION SENSOR WHICH COST ME $600.00. THE TRUCK WOULDN'T PASS INSPECTION WITH OUT IT BECAUSE THE MIL LIGHT WAS ON, EVEN THOUGH IT PASSED EMISSIONS. THE DEALERSHIP WAS GOING TO CHARGE ME 400.00 TO INSTALL THE SENSOR. WE FIGURED OUT HOW TO INSTALL IT ON MY OWN SAVE SOME MONEY. *AK",
