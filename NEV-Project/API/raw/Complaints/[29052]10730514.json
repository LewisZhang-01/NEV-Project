THIS PUT ME IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION AND THE CAR BEHIND ME ALMOST REAR ENDED ME BUT SWERVED AWAY. LUCKILY MY CAR MANAGED TO GLIDE TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER AND OUT OF HARM'S WAY. AFTERWARD I HAD TO GET MY CAR TOWED. I WAS QUOTED AT VARIOUS DEALERSHIPS THAT THE REPAIR WOULD BE EXCESS OF 3000, SO NOW I'M STUCK WITH REPAIRS THAT EXCEED THE VALUE OF MY CAR.     APPARENTLY, HONDA DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB OF CREATING A RELIABLE TRANSMISSION.",
