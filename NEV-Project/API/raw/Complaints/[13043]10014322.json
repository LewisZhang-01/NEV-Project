I HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER AT LEAST THREE TIMES AND WAS TOLD THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR.  I WAS TOLD TO CALL THE TOW SERVICE THE NEXT TIME IT STALLS AND NOT TO RESTART THE CAR.  THE VEHICLE IS DRIVEN IN CITY TRAFFIC AND I TOLD THEM I WAS NOT GOING TO BLOCK RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC AND RISK BEING REARENDED TO WHICH I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.  I CALLED THE FORD 800 NUMBER TWICE AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY STAND BEHIND THEIR DEALERS AND IF THEY SAY THERE IS NOTHING WRONG AND THAT THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO  WHEN I ASKED THE FORD \"TALKING HEAD\" IF FORD WAS GOING TO PAY FOR MY FUNERAL WHEN THE CALL STALLED ON AN INTERSTATE EXIT RAMP AND WAS REARENDED BY A MAC TRUCK I WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD HAVE TO CONTACT MY INSURANCE COMPANY.  A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND FORWARDED TO ME.  TO MY SURPRISE AND CONTRARY TO THE IMPRESSION I RECEIVED FROM THE LOCAL FORD DEALER AND THE FORD 800 NUMBER THIS STALLING PROBLEM WAS NOT UNKNOWN AND COULD BE DANGEROUS.  BELOW IS LISTED THE LATEST CASES OF STALLING.  *NLM",
