THERE ARE 4 LARGE BURNED AND MELTED AREAS (AS IF IT HAD BEEN ON A GIANT GRILL) ON THE SIDEWALL OF THE SPARE TIRE THAT FACES THE UNDERCARRIAGE WHERE IT IS SUSPENDED UNDERNEATH THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE.  I ASSUME THIS IS FROM THE MUFFLER OR SOME OTHER HOT METAL. IN ADDITION TO WONDERING IF THIS IS A FIRE HAZARD, I AM ALSO APPREHENSIVE ABOUT THE INTEGRITY AND SAFETY OF THE SPARE TIRE ONCE IT IS PLACED ON THE CAR.   *TR",
