SO I ORDERED THE PART AND THEN FOUND OUT ABOUT THE RECALL. A FEW WEEKS LATER MY CAR WOULDN'T START AND AFTER TRYING FOR A BIT THE BATTERY DIED. I TOWED IT TO A DODGE DEALERSHIP TOLD THEM A MECHANIC SAID I NEEDED A NEW IGNITION SWITCH THEY RAN A FULL DIAGNOSTIC AND SAID EVERYTHING WAS FINE IT WAS JUST THE BATTERY. I PAID FOR A BATTERY & DIAGNOSTIC AND WENT ON MY WAY. A FEW DAYS LATER CAR WOULDN'T START AT THE STORE. I TOOK MY CAR TO A DIFFERENT DODGE DEALERSHIP TOLD THEM THE ISSUES I WAS HAVING & THAT IT MIGHT BE THE IGNITION SWITCH THEY RAN A DIAGNOSTIC SAID THEY THINK IT WAS A RELAY SWITCH SO THEY REPLACED THAT. THEY SAID IF IT STILL HAD PROBLEMS STARTING IT WOULD BE THE IGNITION SWITCH GOING BAD. A COUPLE WEEKS LATER I'M AT THE GAS STATION CAR WON'T START. I CALLED THE DODGE DEALERSHIP I TOOK IT TO THE LAST TIME THEY TOLD ME TO BRING THE CAR BACK SO THEY CAN RUN ANOTHER DIAGNOSTIC. I CALLED THE CORPORATE # EXPLAINED WHAT WAS HAPPENING TOLD THEM I NEED A NEW IGNITION SWITCH BUT NO PARTS ARE BEING MANUFACTURED SO I CANT GET IT FIXED AND THEY ARE TRYING TO TELL ME IT'S NOT THE IGNITION SWITCH THAT IS THE PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN STRANDING COUNTLESS TIMES ALL I WANT IS A WORKING PART FOR MY CAR AND THEY ARE ALL GIVING ME THE RUN AROUND.  MY CAR HAS PROBLEMS STARTING EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS SOMETIME A COUPLE TIMES A DAY. THEY HAVE NO SOLUTIONS AND I NEED A WORKING CAR.",
