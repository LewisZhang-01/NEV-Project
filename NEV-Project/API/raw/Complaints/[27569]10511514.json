THESE CARS HAVE BEEN RECALLED IN CANADA, WHY NOT IN THE USA. MAYBE IT'S POLITICAL. I HAVE BEEN TO THREE CHEVY DEALERS  AND GOTTEN A DIFFERENT STORY FROM EACH ONE. GM IS REPLACING THESE MOTORS IN COBALT MODELS, AND ALSO ON SOME SATURN MODELS. THIS IS AN ELECTRIC POWER STEERING ASSIST MOTOR. THE FIRST DEALER I WENT TO SAID I PROBABLY NEEDED POWER STEERING FLUID. I TOLD HIM IT WAS AN ELECTRIC POWER STEERING MOTOR AND DID NOT USE POWER STEERING FLUID. HE WAS THE SERVICE MGR! I WAS TOLD HE WOULD CHECK WITH THE FACTORY AND CALL ME THE NEXT DAY. AFTER TWO WEEKS I WENT BACK TO THE DEALER AND SAW THE SAME SERVICE. MGR.  HE ACTED LIKE HE DID NOT REMEMBER ME BUT SAID THEY HAD  A LOT OF THESE HHR IN WITH POWER STEERING PROBLEMS. SO GO FIGURE. ANOTHER DEALER  TOLD ME $1800.00 TO REPAIR. THE POWER STEERING MOTOR COST IS $107.00 AT MOST CHEVY DEALERS, PLUS INSTALLATION. YOU GET NOTHING BUT B/S FROM DEALERS. THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD, A WOMEN OR OLD PERSON COULD NOT STEER THESE CARS WHEN POWER STEERING STOPS WORKING.!!!!!!!  *TR",
