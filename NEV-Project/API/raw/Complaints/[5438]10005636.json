REP[LECED PADS AND ROTORS. 21000+MILES  SAME THING REPLACED CALIPERS. (NOTE) BY THIS TIME I HAD HAD MY WHEELS ROTATED 7 TIMES IN 21000 MILES. (4) 17\" MICHELIN RADIALS SHOT. AT THIS POINT I REPLACED THE TIRES WITH 600.00 WORTH OF GOODYEARS. GOODYEAR CHECKED THE ALLIGNMENT. IT WAS OUT. THEY REPAIRED IT AS BEST AS THEY COULD BUT SAID THAT I NEEDED A PARTIAL BALL JOINT. I WENT TO JEEP SINCE I THOUGHT THAT THE BALL JOINT WOULD BE UNDER WARRANTY. YES IT WAS BUT ONLY IF THE CAR WAS OUT OF ALLIGNMENT. SINCE GOODYEAR HAD ALLIGNED IT AS BEST AS THEY COULD TO PREVENT UNEVEN WEAR ON THE NEW TIRES. JEEP REFUSED TO REPAIR THE BALL JOINT UNDER WARRANTY. THEY SAID I WOULD HAVE TO PAY 200+ OR WAIT UNTIL IT WENT OUT OF ALIGNMNET AGAIN. THE GAS TANK HAS BEEN OFF THREE TIME TO REPAIR A STARTING PROBLEM.",
