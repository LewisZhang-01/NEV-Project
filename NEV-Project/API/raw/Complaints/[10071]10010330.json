WHEN I CONTACTED MY FORD DEALERSHIP THEY \"HAD NEVER HEARD OF THAT BEFORE\", BUT WHEN I DID A LITTLE MORE RESEARCH I FOUND AT LEAST 50 MORE COMPLAINTS.  I CONTACTED THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY DIRECTLY TO SEE WHY THERE HAD NOT BEEN A RECALL ON WHAT APPEARS TO BE A MANUFACTURING DEFECT BECAUSE ALL PROBLEMS OF THIS NATURE INVOLVED ONLY THE 96-98 FORD WINDSTAR MODELS.  THEY INFORMED ME THEY KNEW OF THE PROBLEM BUT ONLY THE NHTSA COULD INITIATE A RECALL.  I HAD NEVER HEARD OF THIS AND I DOUBT OTHER OWNERS OF THESE VEHICLES DO, EITHER OR THERE WOULD BE MORE COMPLAINTS. THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM.*JB",
