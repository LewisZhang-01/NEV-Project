        "summary": "WE HAVE HAD NUMEROUS ISSUES WITH THE CARS BRAKES AUTOMATICALLY LOCKING UP WHEN SOMETHING TRIGGERS THE COLLISION SAFETY BREAK.  SPECIFICALLY WHEN CROSSING RAIL ROAD TRACKS AFTER A TRAIN HAS PAST.  AS A RESULT THE CAR STOPS COMPLETELY AND AUTOMATICALLY WHILE ON RAILROAD TRACKS AND WON'T ALLOW YOU TO MOVE.  YOU HAVE TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK, WAIT (ON RAILRAOD TRACKS) AND THEN ATTEMPT TO MOVE BUT IT MAY ACTIVATE IT AGAIN SO YOU HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN.  MEANWHILE YOU ARE ON TRACKS, WITH CARS BEHIND YOU HONKING AND SCREAMING.  THIS HAS HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES, REPORTED IT TO OUR DEALER, SERVICE AND GMC CORPORATE WHERE NOTHING WAS DONE.  THEY SAID THEY WOULD PUT IN A \"BLACK BOX\" LIKE DEVICE BUT NEVER DID.  IT IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN FOR MY FAMILY AND ONE THAT GMC IS NOT ADDRESSING ADAQUATELY.",
