FOUND OUT THROUGH MY EMPLOYER THERE HAD BEEN A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM.  WHY WAS IT NOT CORRECTED BEFORE I PURCHASED IT FROM THE CHEVY DEALER.  ALSO INFORMED MY AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT WAS ON AND THE A MODULE WAS AT FAULT AND WOULD COST ANOTHER $550 TO FIX AND THAT IT MAY INFLATE AIRBAG WHILE DRIVING.  THESE ARE TOTALLY UNREALISTIC PROBLEMS TO OCCUR IN A 2 YEAR OLD MODEL WITH LESS THEN 40,000 MI.           *JB",
