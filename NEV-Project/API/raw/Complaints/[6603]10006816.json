        "summary": "PLASTIC FUEL TANK STARTED LEAKING CAUSING A FIRE HAZARD. I CONTACTED TWO LOCAL FORD DEALERS AND BOTH TOLD ME THAT THE PLASTIC FUEL TANKS IN FORD ESCORTS HAD NUMEROUS PROBLEMS AND WERE SUBJECT TO EMERGENCY MAJOR RECALLS. AFTER RESEARCH ON RECALLS 97V144 AND 97V145, BOTH DEALERSHIPS TELL ME THAT FOR SOME REASON MY VIN NUMBER IS EXCLUDED BUT BOTH DEALERSHIPS FEEL IT IS A MANUFACTURER'S DESIGN DEFECT AND POSES A \"SEVERE\" SAFETY HAZARD TO LIFE. I CONTACTED FORD CONSUMER SERVICE ND THEY BASICALLY SHINED ME ON. I FEEL FORD SHOULD REPLACE THE FUEL TANK AS IT IS OBVIOUSLY A DESIGN FLAW AND A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. WHY IF THEY RECALLED 64,600 OTHER 1995 FORD ESCORTS WITH LEAKING PLASTIC FUEL TANKS WOULD THEY EXCLUDE MY VEHICLE. THIS DEMONSTRATES GROSS NEGLIGENCE ON THE PART OF FORD MOTOR COMPANY. AND , FOR A CONSUMER THAT HAS BOUGHT 6 \"NEW\" FORD CARS SINCE JANUARY 2001, IT TELLS ME THAT I DON'T WANT TO BUY ANYMORE NEW FORDS. I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR ASSISTANCE IN THIS MATTER TO CONVINCE FORD TO STAND BEHIND THE OBVIOUS DESIGN FLAW. THANKS, JASON HOLLAND, ESQ.    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**770830",
