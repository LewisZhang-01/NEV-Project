THE TRANSMISSION SLIPS HORRIBLY AND MAY TIMES THE TRUCK WILL NOT ACCELERATE AT ALL ONCE I REACH  30 MPH AND THE RPMS RED LINE ALMOST EVERY TIME. NOW THE TRANSMISSION IS COMPLETELY SHOT AND I'VE BEEN TOLD IT WILL BE A MINIMUM OF 2,000.00. NO TRANSMISSIONS COULD BE FOUND AT JUNK YARDS BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT THESE VEHICLES ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BAD TRANSMISSIONS.   *NLM",
