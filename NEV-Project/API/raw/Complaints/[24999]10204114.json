I PULLED IN THE CLUTCH LEVER AND COASTED TO THE SHOULDER OF THE STREET. BIKE WOULD NOT START. I CALLED THE DEALER. HE SAID OPEN THE GAS CAP AND LOOK IN AT THE FUEL AND TURN ON THE KEY. IF YOU SEE FUEL SWIRLING AROUND IN THE TANK THAT MEANS THE FUEL HOSE HAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE FUEL PUMP AND THE ENGINE IS NOT GETTING ANY FUEL. I MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE THE BIKE TRANSPORTED TO THE DEALER. HE SAID THERE WAS NO RECALL AND WILL FIX THE BIKE BY RE-ATTACHING THE FUEL LINE. THE BIKE HAS ABOUT 600 MILES ON IT AND REPAIR IS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  *JB",
