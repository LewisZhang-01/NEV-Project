UPON PICK-UP, THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO RELEASE MY CAR DUE TO STEERING WHEEL COLUMN LOCK-UP, DURING INITIAL KEY-IN AND START-UP.  KATHLEEN DEMETER ACKNOWLEDGES THIS CONCERN IN HER LETTER TO JAY EHLE, DATED FEB.5,2003 (NVS-213, EA02-031).  EVERY ATTEMPT TO FIX/ADDRESS THE PROBLEM RESULTED IN NO FIX.  GM STATS THIS PROBLEM WAS NOT UNDER RECALL.  I CONTEND IT MUST BE FOR GM TO HAVE FOUND THE SAME ERROR IN EARLIER/LATER MODEL YEARS.  IT NOW IS COSTING ME $500.00 TO FIX IT.  CAN YOU ASSIST ME?   *NLM",
