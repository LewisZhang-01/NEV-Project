DEALER/SERVICE ORIGINALLY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A FAILURE OF THE \"VARIABLE VALVE TIMING ACTUATOR,\" BUT LATER RE-DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A FAILURE OF THE WIRING HARNESS.  THE CAR WAS RETURNED 11/30/06.  AFTER 20 MINUTES OF DRIVING, THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT REACTIVATED.  I RETURNED THE CAR IMMEDIATELY.   ON 12/01/06, THE DEALER/SERVICE DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AND SAID A \"VACUUM TUBE\" DISCONNECTED.  I PICKED UP CAR ON 12/01/06.  AFTER A COUPLE HOURS OF DRIVING, THE \"P\" FOR PARK LIGHT ILLUMINATED WHILE I WAS IN DRIVE. (THE \"P\" AND \"D\" INDICATORS WERE BOTH ILLUMINATED AS I WAS DRIVING.  ALSO, THE DOOR LOCKS ON ALL DOORS ENGAGED AND DISENGAGED UNCONTROLLABLY AND CONTINUOUSLY.  I WAS NOT ABLE TO MANUALLY LOCK OR UNLOCK MY CAR DOORS USING THE \"LOCK/UNLOCK\" SWITCH ON THE DRIVE-SIDE DOOR SINCE IT WAS DEACTIVATED AS A RESULT OF THE MALFUNCTION.  I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER/SERVICE ON 12/02/06 FOR THIS PROBLEM.  DEALER/SERVICE DIAGNOSES THE PROBLEM AS A ELECTRICAL SHORT DUE TO A COOLANT LEAK.  I WAS PROMISED THAT THE CAR WOULD BE RETURNED 12/4/06 AFTERNOON.  *NM",
