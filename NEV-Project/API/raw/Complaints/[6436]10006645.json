THE DEALER HAD THE CAR FOR 2 WEEKS AND REPLACED ONLY 2 OF THE 4 COILS.  SINCE THE COILS ARE RATIONED, THEY WILL NOT REPLACE THE REMAINING COILS UNTIL THEY FAIL.  AM I SUPPOSE TO WAIT UNTIL I HAVE AN ACCIDENT ON THE HIGHWAY?  BOTH THE DEALER AND THE MANUFACTURER ADMIT THE DEFECT.  WHY HASN'T A RECALL BEEN ISSUED?  THERE ARE 40+ CUSTOMERS AT THIS DEALERSHIP WITH THE SAME PROBLEM, ALL WAITING FOR A MAJOR PART THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE.  I WILL NOT DRIVE THE CAR UNTIL ALL FOUR ARE REPLACED.  I HAVE A YOUNG SON AND WILL NOT DRIVE THE CAR WITH A KNOWN ENGINE PROBLEM, PARTICULARLY A PROBLEM THAT APPEARS TO BE PRETTY WIDESPREAD.  (THE OTHER COMPLAINTS LISTED ON YOUR WEB SITE FOR THIS MODEL SOUND LIKE I COULD HAVE WRITTEN THEM.)  THE MANUFACTURER WHEN CONTACTED HAS BEEN COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE.  *JB      ****DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*****770835",
