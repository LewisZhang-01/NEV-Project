THE REAR AIR STRUTS PARTS EACH COST MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THE FRONT ONES COST MORE THAN $350 EACH FROM LINCOLN DEALER. THE REASON OF LEAK IS THAT SOME SAND WILL GET BETWEEN AIR THE SPRING RUBBER SURFACE AND STRUT BODY WHICH CAUSE AIR BAG SPRING RUBBER TO GRIND AND CUT.  ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THAT ONE OF A FRONT SUSPENSION HEIGHT SENSOR LINK LOOSEN CAUSED ONE FRONT AIR SUSPENSION BAG BLOWED UP. IF THIS HAPPENED AT REAR WILL CAUSE BOTH REAR AIR SUSPENSION SPRING BLOW UP SINCE ONLY ONE HEIGHT SENSOR AT REAR FOR BOTH AIR SPRINGS.  *JB",
