BMW WAS WITHIN THEIR RIGHTS AS THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED, BUT THERE ARE OTHER DOCUMENTED INCIDENTS WITH FAILURES AROUND THE SAME MILEAGE WHICH MAY INDICATE A DEFECTIVE PART.  BMW APPARENT WILL NOT FIX COMPRESSORS MAKING NOISE EVEN UNDER WARRANTY.  IF TRUE, THIS IS POOR PERFORMANCE FROM THIS AUTOMOBILE MAKER.   *NLM",
