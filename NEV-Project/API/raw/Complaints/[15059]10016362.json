THE SHAPE OF THE COIL CAUSES THE STRAIGHT PIECE OF PLASTIC TUBING NOT BE TIGHT TO THE SHAPE OF THE COIL. I ASSUME WATER, ROAD SALT AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS THAT WOULD CAUSE CORROSION WERE ABLE TO GET UNDER THE PLASTIC TUBING AND CORRODE THE COIL SPRING TO THE POINT OF ITS SUDDEN COLLAPSE AND FAILURE. THE BREAK OCCURRED DIRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SLEEVE OF TUBING. IT BROKE AFTER 3 YEARS AND 3 MONTHS WITH ONLY 44000 MILES ON THE CAR. A SOLID STEEL COIL SPRING SHOULD NOT CORRODE AND SNAP.       *JB",
