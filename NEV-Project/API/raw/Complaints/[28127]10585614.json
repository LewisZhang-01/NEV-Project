THIS PAINT ISSUE WAS NOT PRESENT WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR, BUT THE ISSUE IS UNDER THE CLEAR-COAT SO THERE WAS NOTHING THE DETAILER COULD DO. AS PREVIOUSLY POINTED OUT BY ANOTHER COMPLAINT, THESE MARKS ARE GROWING LARGER AND WILL HURT THE FUTURE RESELL VALUE OF THE CAR AS WELL AS POSSIBLY DAMAGE THE HOOD IF NOT FIXED PROPERLY. THIS OCCURRED THROUGH NO FAULT OF MY OWN (DRIVER). MY VEHICLE IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY, BUT AM UNSURE WHAT TO DO.   *JS",
