        "summary": "I HAVE BEEN DRIVING THIS CAR FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS WITH NO IGNITION PROBLEM.  I DROVE TO WORK, AND RAN A FEW WORK RELATED ERRANDS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.  AS I WAS PREPARING TO LEAVE WORK FOR THE DAY I PUT MY KEY INTO THE IGNITION AND IT FELT AS IF IT WERE COMPLETELY LOCKED. MORE THAN 3 PEOPLE TRIED TO TURN THE KEY AND OFFERED DIFFERENT IDEAS AS TO WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.  TRIPLE A WAS CALLED OUT AND HE EXPLAINED THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL.  HE INFORMED ME THE TUMBLERS IN THE IGNITION HAVE SUDDENLY STOPPED DROPPING AND RECOGNIZING MY KEY.  HE THEN PLACED THE KEY IN THE IGNITION, TAPPED IN A FEW TIMES TO RELEASE THE TUMBLERS AND IT STARTED.  WE THEN TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF AND STRUGGLED A BIT TO GET THE KEY OUT.  IT IS NOW 2 DAYS LATER AND THE SITUATION HAS GOTTEN WORSE AND IS AFFECTING MY TRANSPORTATION.  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKED FINE ALL DAY WITHOUT A \"STICKING\" FEELING OR A RESISTANCE TO TURN AND NOW IT IS COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET IN AND TURN THE KEY WITH EASE. IT IS SIMPLY STUCK AND NO ONE CAN REALLY EXPLAIN WHY, OTHER THAN POOR QUALITY WITHIN THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY. *TR",
