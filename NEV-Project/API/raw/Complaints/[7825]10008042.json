WENT TO DEALERSHIP FRIDAY 2-21-2003 AND THEY SAID I COULDN'T GET MY CAR IN UNTIL MARCH 3 BECAUSE THEY HAD SO MANY WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.   I NEED MY CAR, SO I WENT HOME AND SUCKED ALL THE WATER OUT.  THAT SAME NIGHT IT RAINED AGAIN, AND SURE ENOUGH, ABOUT 1/2 OF WATER ON THE FLOOR.  SO NOW I HAVE A NEW CAR THAT SMELLS LIKE MOLD.THE OTHER THING IS THEY TOLD ME AFTER MY WARRANTY WAS UP I WOULD HAVE TO START PAYING FOR THE REPAIRS MYSELF.  MY CAR IS ALREADY RUINED, AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PROBLEM CANNOT BE FIXED.  THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME IT HAS LEAKED.  WHAT SHOULD I DO?  WHY DON'T THEY RECALL THEM IF IT IS DEFECT?",
