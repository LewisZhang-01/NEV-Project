VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED BY AN INFINITI DEALER WHO COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE IGNITION KEY OR ASSEMBLY, OR WHY THE PART FAILED.  AS A SAFETY ISSUE I ASKED INFINITI USA TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER AND THEY PRETTY MUCH GAVE ME THE \"BRUSH-OFF\" WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION.    I SEE THIS A A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE CONSIDERING A PERSON(S) COULD BE STRANDED IN ANY WEATHER CONDITIONS IF THE IGNITION DID NOT ALLOW THEM TO START THE VEHICLE.  IF IN A REMOTE AREA A PERSON COULD EASILY FREEZE TO DEATH WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO START THE VEHICLE.  I DON'T BELIEVE THE PART SHOULD HAVE FAILED CONSIDERING THE MINIMAL AMOUNT OF MILEAGE ON THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME.  THIS IS NOT A NORMAL PART THAT A PERSON COULD HAVE MAINTAINED TO HAVE IN A WORKING CONDITION, IT IS SUBJECT TO FAILURE AT ANY GIVEN TIME BASED ON WHAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD.  THIS IS NOT YOUR NORMAL ITEM SUBJECT TO WEAR AND TEAR, IT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER.  *TR",
