BECAUSE I CAN NOT HEAR THE CLICKING SOUND WITH THE NORMAL BACKGROUND  ROAD NOISES, THE TURN SIGNALS STAY ON EVEN THOUGH I AM NOT GOING TO TURN.  I SEE THIS AS A SAFETY AND TRAFFIC VIOLATION ISSUE AND HAVE COMPLAINED TO BOTH MY TOYOTA DEALER AND TO THE CAR MANUFACTURER DIRECTLY, BUT THEY TELL ME THEY HAVE NO SOLUTION FOR MY COMPLAINT.  PLEASE ADVISE ME AS TO HOW TO GET SATISFACTION AND RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM.    *NLM",
