        "summary": "TODAY I HAVE EXPERIENCED WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE MORE THAN A DEFECT IN MY 2002 ACURA 3.2 TL-S. PRIOR TO TODAY I HAVE DELT WITH NUMEROUS MINOR DEFECTS SUCH AS A BROKEN SWAY BAR LINK, LEAKING TRANSMISSION SEALS AND BRAKE FITTINGS, PAINT/TRIM DEFECTS AND TWO DEFECTIVE TIRES. TODAY'S INCIDENT WAS UNACCEPTABLE AND THE ONLY REASON I MADE IT HOME SAFELY TONIGHT WAS PURE LUCK! ON CA-101 IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA DURING RUSH-HOUR I WAS IN BUMPER-TO-BUMPER TRAFFIC TRAVELING AT 65 MPH SURROUNDED BY CARS WHEN MY FRONT TIRE LOCKED UP SENDING MY CAR INTO THE LANE ON MY RIGHT. AS I COUNTER-STEERED TO KEEP THE CAR FROM CRASHING INTO THE CARS ON MY RIGHT THE CAR STARTED TO LOSE CONTROL AND SWERVE IN THE OTHER DIRECTION DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS STILL STUCK IN WHAT APPEARED TO BE FIRST GEAR. AFTER COMPLETING A 360 DEGREE SPIN AND BARELY AVOIDING THE HUGE SUV COMING STRAIGHT AT ME I WAS ABLE TO GAIN CONTROL AND PULL OFF OF THE FREEWAY WHERE I TOOK A FEW MINUTES TO CALM MYSELF AND THANK GOD I WAS STILL ALIVE. THE CAR IS STUCK IN ONE GEAR RIGHT NOW AND WILL BE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP IN THE MORNING WHERE I AM GOING EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT I REFUSE TO DRIVE IT UNTIL THE TRANSMISSION IS REPLACED WITH A NEW ONE, NOT REPAIRED. IN MY OPINION THIS GOES BEYOND A SIMPLE WARRANTY EXTENSION (WHICH I ALREADY PURCHASED - 7Y/100,000) AND COULD HAVE NOT ONLY COST MY LIFE, BUT THE LIFE OF OTHERS AS WELL.",
