        "summary": "I HAVE A 1999 FORD EXPEDITION THAT HAS A FAULTY RIGHT SIDE CYLINDER HEAD.  OIL LEAKS ONTO THE EXHAUST WHICH IS A POTENTIAL FIRE HAZARD.  THROUGH MY OWN RESEARCH I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM (OIL LEAK FROM THE RIGHT SIDE HEAD) WITH THIS VEHICLE.  THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS THAT I HAVE FOUND ON THE INTERNET.  FORD REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM WITH THE CONSUMER BUT HAS SENT OUT TECHNICAL SUPPORT INFORMATION TO THEIR MECHANICS ON HOW TO FIX IT.  TO ME THAT'S AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT A PROBLEM EXISTS.  IF MY VEHICLE WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY THEY WOULD FIX IT (WHICH TO ME IS ANOTHER ACKNOWLEDGEMENT TO THIS PROBLEM) BUT SINCE IT'S NOT THEY WON'T BACK IT UP.   REPAIRS WOULD COST ME APROX $ 2,000.  THROUGH MY RESEARCH I HAVE FOUND THAT THIS PROBLEM HAS EXISTED SINCE THESE VEHICLE WERE NEW, BACK IN 1999.  I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE WITH APROX 40K MILES ON IT AND TODAY I HAVE APROX 75K MILES ON IT.   I NOTICED A BURNING SMELL SHORTLY AFTER I PURCHASED IT BUT ONLY RECENTLY DID I REALIZE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.  I HAD AN OIL CHANGE DONE BY AN EX FORD MECHANIC AND HE ADMITTED THAT THE EXPEDITION IS KNOWN FOR THIS OIL LEAK BUT FORD WON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.               *TT",
