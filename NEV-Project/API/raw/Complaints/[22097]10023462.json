ELECTRICAL FAILURES WITH BLINKER LIGHT (INSIDE AND OUTSIDE) AND OUTSIDE REAR DRIVER SIDE LIGHT STAYING ON EVEN WHEN CAR IS TURNED OFF. SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAYS THEY FIND NOTHING WRONG. LETTERS WRITTEN TO MITSUBISHI GO UNRESPONSIVE TO AND/OR ARE REFERRED TO MY LOCAL SERVICE DEPARTMENT, WITH NO RESPONSE, ONLY THAT MY CLAIMS ARE DENIED. NEED HELP. PLEASE CHECK THIS OUT. CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW A BRAND NEW VEHICLE CAN HAVE TO HAVE SO MANY PARTS REPLACED (AT MY EXPENSE) AND SO MANY OTHER DEFECTS AND NO ONE PROVIDE ANY ANSWERS/REASONS OR RESPONSES TO COMPLAINTS. PLEASE HELP. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR ATTENTION.    *NLM",
