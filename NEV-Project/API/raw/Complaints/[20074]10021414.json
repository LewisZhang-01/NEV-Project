I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER 2XS AND THE PERFORMED 2 WHEEL ALIGNMENTS.  THIS IS NOT THE ISSUE AS IT STARTED WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR LAST NOV 2002 AND CONTINUES EVERY DAY.  THIS CAR IS VERY UNSAFE TO DRIVE DUE TO THIS WANDERING ISSUE.  THE DEALER STATED THE STEERING IS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE. I AGAIN DISAGREE SINCE THE ONLY REASON I HAVE TO ADJUST IS DUE TO THE WANDERING WHICH HAPPENS ON ITS OWN.*AK",
