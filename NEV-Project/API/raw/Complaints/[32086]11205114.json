        "summary": "MY 2019 HONDA CR V EX L HAS A SERIOUS SEAT BELT SAFETY ISSUE: THERE ARE THREE SEAT BELT ASSEMBLIES IN THE SECOND ROW.  IN ORDER TO BUCKLE THE LEFT REAR SEATBELT (BEHIND THE DRIVER) THE BELT HAS TO CROSS OVER THE BUCKLE  FOR THE CENTER SEAT BELT.  THIS RENDERS ONE OF THE 3 SEAT BELTS VIRTUALLY USELESS.  IF THEY ARE ENGAGED THEY ARE UNSAFE AND THEY ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET  THEM BUCKLED.  I GOT THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT  HAD A GOOD SAFETY RECORD AND I NEED TO USE IT EVERY DAY WITH MY THREE  LITTLE GRANDSONS.  I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE ONE OF THEM SEATED IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AS HONDA SAYS THAT WOULD BE UNSAFE FOR ONE OF MY 8 YEAR OLD TWIN GRANDSONS OR MY 9 YEAR OLD GRANDSON BECAUSE OF AIR BAG ISSUES IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT. I HAVE CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND HONDA CUSTOMER CARE  WITH NO RESULTS.. I WAS TOLD THAT HONDA IS AWARE OF THE SAFETY PROBLEM BUT HAS NO PLANS TO CORRECT IT.  THERE WAS A CALIFORNIA CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT  ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.  I FIND IT VERY DISTURBING THAT HONDA IS IGNORING THIS. THIS IS MY 7TH NEW HONDA AND MY LAST.",
