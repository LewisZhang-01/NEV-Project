I HAVE ALSO HAD TO REPLACE THE CLUTCH FAN 3 TIMES WITHIN 3 MONTHS. MY HOOD KEEPS SQUEAKING AND HAS TO BE READJUSTED EVERY OTHER MONTH. MY INSTRUMENT PANEL HAS GONE OUT TWICE. THE ALARM ALSO WORKS WHEN IT WANTS TO AND THE PASSENGER SIDE SEAT BELT ALWAYS LOCKS UP. ON 6/13/03 IT LEFT FINALLY LEFT ME STRANDED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD ON THE WAY TO CALIFORNIA. I LIVE IN ARIZONA AND WAS TRAVELING WITH MY WIFE, MOTHER-IN-LAW AND OUR 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER.  I HAD TO PAY FOR A RENTAL CAR AND HAD TO SUBMIT TO GM TO REIMBURSE ME FOR THE RENTAL CAR. BY READING ALL THE COMPLAINTS ON THESE 2002 TRAILBLAZERS I THINK WE SHOULD ALL GET TOGETHER AND DO A CLASS ACT LAW SUIT TOWARDS GM. E-MAIL ME WITH YOUR THOUGHTS. JORGUTIERR5@AOL.COM.   *NLM",
