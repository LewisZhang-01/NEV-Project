THE SECOND TIME WAS IN NOVEMBER 2002 - THIS HAS NOT BEEN REPAIRED.  ONE OF MY FRIENDS HAS A HYUNDAI ACCENT AND HE JUST HAD A STONE CHIP AND WINDSHIELD HAD TO BE REPLACE.  I HAD MINE FIXED AT SAFE-T-GLASS IN WALLKINLL NY AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY FIX MORE HYUNDAI WINDSHIELDS THAN ANY OTHER CAR.  MY FRIEND HAD HIS REPLACED AT ROSEN'S GLASS IN MIDDLETOWN, NY THIS PAST WEEK AND THE OWNER STATED THAT HYUNDAI GLASS IS \"'!@#$%\" AND THEY HAVE REPLACE A \"TON\" OF THEM.  I WANT TO KNOW IF THIS IS A DEFECTIVE SAFETY PRODUCT AND CAN THIS BE CHECKED INTO?  THANK YOU - KEN NAGLE.    *NLM",
