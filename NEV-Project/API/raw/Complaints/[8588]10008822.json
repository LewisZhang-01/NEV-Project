I BELIEVE IT IS SOMETHING ELSE OTHER THAN THE TRANSMISSION. ON 4-15-02 MY VEHICLE WAS IN THE GARAGE I PARKED IT FACING THE STREET AS I BACK IT INTO THE GARAGE AND WHEN I STARTED IT UP, PUT IT INTO DRIVE, THE VEHICLE LUNGED FORWARD NEARLY STRIKING MY WIFE WHO WAS WALING INTO THE GARAGE FROM THE SIDE. I BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO AS A ACCIDENT COULD OCCUR IF NOT ALREADY. *TS  ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12-12-02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS***760968",
