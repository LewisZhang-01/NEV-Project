I AM NOT SURE WHAT YOU WANT FOR THEM.  IF IT MEANS IS THE PART ORIGINAL.  THE ANSWER IS YES.  WHY ASK THIS UNDER VEHICLE?  SHOULD IT BE UNDER EQUIPMENT?  COULD YOU CHECK ON MY PREVIOUS COMPLAINT WITH MY 95 COUGAR AND SEE IF IT IS ANSWERED CORRECTLY?  ALL PARTS WERE ORIGINAL ON THAT VEHICLE ALSO.  *JB",
