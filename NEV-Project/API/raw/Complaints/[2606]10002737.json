THIS PROBLEM CAUSES VIBRATING AND PULSATION WHEN APPLYING PRESSURE TO THE BRAKES.THE FIRST TIME I TOOK IT INTO THE DEALER, THEY LOOKED AT IT AND TOLD ME THAT NOTHING WAS WRONG. WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR HOME, MY HUSBAND WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE RESPONSE I RECEIVED AND WE BROUGHT IT BACK A SECOND TIME.    THE REPLACED THE ROTORS BUT CHARGED ME A $35.00 FEE. IT HAS BEEN APPROXIMATELY 4 MONTHS AND THE SAME PROBLEM IS BEGINNING TO HAPPEN AGAIN. I PURCHASED MY CAR BRAND NEW AND IT IS LESS THAN 2 YEARS OLD WITH 19900 MILES.",
