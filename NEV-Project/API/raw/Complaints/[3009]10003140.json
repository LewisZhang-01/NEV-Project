WHILE TRAVELING 65 MPH SOUTH ON THE SAWGRASS EXPRESSWAY (SUNRISE, FL) BETWEEN MILE MARKER 4 AND 5, MY RIGHT REAR TIRE MADE A POPING SOUND AND WENT FLAT ALMOST IMMEDIATLY (3 TO 4 SECONDS). I WAS ABLE TO GET MY VEHICLE SAFELY TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. THE OUTSIDE OF THE TIRE SHOWED ABOUT A 4 TO 6 INCH TREAD SEPERATION. AFTER AAA REMOVED THE TIRE, THE INSIDE OF THE TIRE SHOWED ALMOST COMPLETE TREAD SEPERATION (IT LOOKED LIKE THE TIRE HAD EXPLODED). THE SIDEWALLS APPEAR TO HAVE FAILED AS WELL. I HAD HAD THE TIRES CHECKED ABOUT TWO WEEKS PRIOR AFTER HAVING A NAIL REMOVED AND PATCHED ON THE LEFT FRONT. INFLATION WAS NORMAL. THE TEMERATURE WAS ABOUT 68 DEGREES AND I HAD BEEN AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES. THE TIRES HAD ABOUT 34,000 MILES OF WEAR ON THEM. THEY WERE REGULARLY ROTATED AND INSPECTED. THE VEHICLE IS A 1995 FORD AREOSTAR XLT. I WAS NOT ABLE TO KEEP THE TIRE, BUT I WAS ABLE TO TAKE 13 DIGITAL PICTURES OF THE FRONT, BACK AND TREAD OF THE TIRE. I WILL MAKE THEM AVAILABLE AT YOUR REQUEST (CD-ROM OR ELECTRONICALY).",
