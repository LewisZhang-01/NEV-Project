        "summary": "I AM EXPERIENCING A CREAKING SOUND COMING FROM THE LOWER CONTROL ARM BUSHINGS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE VEHICLE.  FROM THE NHTSA SITE, I HAVE NOW LEARNED THAT FAILED LOWER CONTROL ARMS AND BUSHINGS ARE A COMMON PROBLEM IN THE PASSAT.  THE VEHICLE WAS JUST PURCHASED \"CERTIFIED\" USED FROM VW FOUR MONTHS AGO WITH 34,000 MILES.  I RETURNED THE CAR TO THE DEALER, WHO SAID THAT THE LOWER CONTROL ARM BUSHINGS WERE \"JUST DRY FROM ROAD SALT\", AND PROCEEDED TO HOSE THE BUSHINGS DOWN WITH AN AEROSOL CAN OF LUBRICANT.  HE SAID THAT IF THIS DID NOT ELIMINATE THE NOISE (IT DIDN'T) THEN I MIGHT WISH TO RETURN IN A WEEK OR SO FOR THEM TO INVESTIGATE FURTHER.  IT IS OBVIOUS FROM THE OTHER COMPLAINTS I HAVE READ WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.  IF THIS VEHICLE'S LOWER CONTROL ARMS FAIL AS FREQUENTLY AS OTHER OWNERS ON THIS SITE HAVE INDICATED, WITH THE ONLY WARNING BEING A DULL CREAKING NOISE, IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT MOST ORDINARY DRIVERS WOULD NEVER HAVE THE PROBLEM INVESTIGATED.  THOSE THAT DO WOULD FIND THAT THE REPAIR IS EXTENSIVE AND EXPENSIVE.  IT IS LIKELY THAT SOME OF THESE MAY CHOOSE TO DELAY OR NEGLECT THE SITUATION.  BOTH SCENARIOS POSE A UNIQUE AND SERIOUS SAFETY THREAT TO THE OPERATORS AND OCCUPANTS OF THE VW PASSAT.  THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THESE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD, AND ALL APPARENTLY SHARE IN WHAT IS AN OBVIOUS DESIGN FLAW THAT CREEPS UP EVERY 25 TO 40 THOUSAND MILES IN SPITE OF VERY EXPENSIVE REPLACEMENT.  FAILURE OF A LOWER CONTROL ARM COULD EASILY CAUSE A CRASH.  VW SHOULD DO THE RIGHT THING BY ACKNOWLEDGING THIS ENGINEERING FAILURE AND VOLUNTARILY RECALL THESE VEHICLES IMMEDIATELY FOR THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF ITS CUSTOMERS.  *NLM",
