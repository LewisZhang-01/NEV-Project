        "summary": "I OWN A 1998 CHEVROLET SILVERADO, 4X4, EXTENDED CAB, 1/2 TON AND IT HAS A MALFUNCTION OF SOME SORT IN THE WINDSHIELD WIPER MOTOR OR COMPUTER MODULE OF THE WIPERS. THE WIPERS WILL NOT ACTIVATE WHEN THEY ARE TURNED TO THE ON POSITION IMMEDIATELY AS THEY SHOULD AND ONCE THEY FINALLY DO ACTIVATE, THEY RANDOMLY AND SPORADICALLY MOVE AND WILL NOT RESPOND WHEN I TURN THEM OFF ON THE WIPER CONTROLS SWITCH. THE VEHICLE IS EQUIPPED WITH RELAY, VARIABLE SPEED AND IT DOES THIS NO MATTER WHAT SPEED SETTING IT IS ON.  ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN SHUT OFF ON THE CONTROL SWITCH, THEY CONTINUE TO KEEP GOING UNTIL I LITERALLY SHUT THE VEHICLE OFF. THEN THEY STOP IN THE UPRIGHT, VERTICAL POTION. LIVING IN ARIZONA, I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF RAIN, BUT WHEN IT DOES RAIN, IT IS A VERY FRUSTRATING AND FRIGHTENING TIME. I HAVE A RELATIVE WITH A 1997 SILVERADO, 4X4, EXTENDED CAB 1/2 TON THAT HAS THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM AND HE RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE FROM GENERAL MOTORS ABOUT THIS AND HAS HAD HIS SITUATION FIXED. I WANT TO KNOW IF MY VEHICLE IS COVERED UNDER THAT RECALL. IT WAS MANUFACTURED IN 04/98. PLEASE HELP FIND SOME INFORMATION ON THIS RECALL AND WHAT VEHICLES ARE AFFECTED.  THANKS    NEIL.       *NLM",
