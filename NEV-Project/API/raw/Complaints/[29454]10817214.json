THIS IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE ESPECIALLY SINCE I HAVE SCOLIOSIS. I AM SITTING AT A DIAGONAL POSITION WHILE DRIVING AND THIS IS VERY DISTRACTING AND UNCOMFORTABLE. . I DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO PAY TO HAVE THIS FIXED AND I SEE MANY OTHERS ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.   I CAN LIFT THE LEFT SIDE OF MY SEAT IT IS LOOSE AND SUNKEN.  I TOOK IT TO THE JONES JUNCTION SUBARU DEALERSHIP IN MD. TO ASK IF THERE WERE ANY RECALLS AND THEY SAID NO AND THEY NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING.  I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD BE RECALLED. I ONLY HAD 46,000 MILES ON MY CAR AT THE TIME. I HAVE REPORTED THIS TO BBB AND CONSUMER REPORTS. ALSO I WILL BE CONTACTING SOA.",
