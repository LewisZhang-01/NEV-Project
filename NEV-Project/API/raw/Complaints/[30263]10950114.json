THE HEAD LIGHTS ON OUR CAR ARE UNSAFE. NOT ENOUGH LIGHT ON ROAD TO DRIVE SAFELY. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR US OLDER DRIVERS. SEEMS GM WOULD PUT GOOD HEADLIGHTS HIGH ON THEIR ENGINEERING REQUIREMENT LIST. THEY DID NOT DO SO WITH THE SRX. THIS MUST BE CORRECTED BEFORE SOMEONE IS HURTS OR KILLED.",
