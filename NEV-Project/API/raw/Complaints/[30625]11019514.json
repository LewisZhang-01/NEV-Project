SO I HAD IT LOOKED AT AND THEY SAID IT WAS A CRANK SENSOR CODE, SO I HAD IT REPLACED. DIDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM FOR LONG. THE LIGHT CAME BACK ON, THROWING THE SAME CODE. WELL THEN A WEEK LATER MY CAR COMPLETELY SHUT OFF WHILE I'M DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD. WHEN I BEGIN TO RESTART IT, NOTHING. IT TAKES SEVERAL ATTEMPTS BEFORE IT WILL START. SINCE THAT INCIDENT I'VE HAD THIS HAPPEN SEVERAL TIMES. I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT I OR MY CHILDREN WILL BE IN AN ACCIDENT DUE TO THE VEHICLE SHUTTING OFF WHILE DRIVING. PLEASE SOMEONE HELP!",
