IT REQUIRES THAT I ADD UP TO 1.2 QTS EVERY 2 MONTHS TO STAY ABOVE THE EMPTY LINE ON THE DIP STICK. MY BROTHER TOLD ME RECENTLY HE HEARD THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON SOME SUBARU VEHICLES DURING MY YEAR DUE TO OIL CONSUMPTION ISSUES. THEREFORE, I CHECKED MY VIN BOTH ON THIS WEBSITE AND DUBARU'S WEBSITE, BUT IT DIDN'T RETURN ANYTHING REGARDING THE OIL CONSUMPTION. CAN I GET SOME HELP WITH THIS ISSUE AS MY WARRANTY HAD ALREADY EXPIRED AND THIS ISSUE MAY BE GETTING WORSE.",
