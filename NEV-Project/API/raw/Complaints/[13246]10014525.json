THIS ALL OCCURRED IN ONE DAY.  IN READING FOR RECALLS AND TSB'S IT APPEARS THIS HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM FOR SOME TIME AND GM CHOOSES NOT TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.  I CALLED TODAY AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE BY GM.  I BARELY MADE IT BACK HOME WITH MY WIFE DUE TO THE PROBLEM.  THIS KNOWN PROBLEM COULD CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. I WISH TO LODGE A FORMAL COMPLAINT AGAINST GM AND ASK THAT YOUR AGENCY CHECK INTO THE SEVERITY AND EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM AND HOW LONG GM HAS KNOWN ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  *JB",
