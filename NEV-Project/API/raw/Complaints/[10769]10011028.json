THE INTAKE MANIFOLD FAILED AND LEAKED ANTIFREEZE THROUGHOUT THE MOTOR.  WE HAD THE MANIFOLDS, OXYGEN SENSORS, AND CATALYTIC CONVERTER REPLACED.  WE FOUND OUT THERE WAS A TSB ISSUED ON THIS VEHICLE REGARDING THE MANIFOLD PROBLEM.  PONTIAC AND THE DEALERSHIP WERE CONTACTED.  THEY BOTH TOLD US IT'S A COMMON PROBLEM, BUT THEY'LL DO NOTHING.  I'D UNDERSTAND GIVEN THE MILEAGE THAT THIS IS NOT A NEW CAR, HOWEVER, KNOWING THERE'S A TSB ISSUED ON IT, IT SEEMS THEY ARE FAILING TO PROVIDE A GOOD PRODUCT TO THEIR CUSTOMERS.",
