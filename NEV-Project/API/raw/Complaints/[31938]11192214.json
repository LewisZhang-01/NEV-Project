THE GRAND PRIX WAS DRIVEN THERE TO SEE IF HE COULD BE PUSHED OUT, AND GOT STUCK - ALONG WITH 4 OTHER CARS. WE TRIED TO PUSH THE CAR OUT, BUT IT WOULDN'T MOVE. WE LEFT THE CAR RUNNING WHILE TRYING TO PUSH THE OTHER VEHICLES. WHILE WALKING FROM THE CAR, WE HEARD POPPING SOUNDS, AND SAW A FLAMES UNDER THE HOOD - PASSENGER'S SIDE. MY FRIEND REACHED IN AND SHUT IT OFF. I CALLED THE POLICE. FIRE TRUCKS PUT OUT THE FIRE, AND A TOW TRUCK WAS CALLED TO GET THE CAR OFF THE SNOW ROUTE AND TAKEN TO AN ACCIDENT IMPOUND. THE NEXT DAY, I CALLED GM AND WAS ASSIGNED A CASE. A WEEK LATER, I WAS ASSIGNED A PAC UNIT REP, TO INVESTIGATE MY CASE. I HAVE MANY EMAILS AND PICTURES FOLLOWING MY CASE. GM HAS PROVIDED A LOT OF MISINFORMATION, LACK OF COMMUNICATION, AND NO PROBLEM RESOLVE. THERE WERE ISSUES INVOLVING THE TITLE, BUT I RESOLVED. I HAD TO TAKE THE PICTURES FOR THE INVESTIGATION, EVEN THOUGH I WAS TOLD REPS WOULD BE SENT OVER. I WENT TO A LOCAL DEALERSHIP, WHERE THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TRIED TO CONTACT THE PAC UNIT. THEY ALSO DID NOT RESPOND TO HIM. AFTER MANY VISITS TO GATEWAY DEALERSHIP AND ASSISTANCE GETTING MY INFORMATION TO SOMEBODY WITH GENERAL MOTORS, IT WAS DETERMINED THE RECALL CAUSED THE FIRE. OIL DRIPPED ON THE MANIFOLD. MY CAR STILL SITS IN THE IMPOUND AT $30 A DAY. I HAVE LEFT NUMEROUS MESSAGES AND EMAILS ASKING FOR UPDATES AND RESOLVE. THE LAST I WAS TOLD IS THAT GM WOULD REPURCHASE MY CAR, AND SEND THE PAPERWORK TO SIGN. THAT WAS 2 WEEKS AGO!  THE LOCAL SERVICE REP HAD TO STOP HELPING ME DUE TO A JOB CHANGE, SO I AM LEFT NOT KNOWING WHAT IS HAPPENING. THE PAC AND GM CUSTOMER SERVICE ARE NOT RETURNING CALLS OR RESPONDING. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP??  [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6). *TT",
