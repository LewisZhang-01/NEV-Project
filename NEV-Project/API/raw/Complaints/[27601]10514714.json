        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY, THE TRAFFIC WAS VERY HEAVY, HENCE I HAD TO APPLY THE BRAKES FREQUENTLY OVER A DISTANCE OF APPROXIMATELY 15-20 MILES.  AS A RESULT OF OVERHEATING OF THE BRAKE DRUMS, ONE OF THE BRAKE CALIPERS 'FROZE' (I.E. THE BRAKE PISTON STUCK IN EXTENDED POSITION) AND CREATED EVEN MORE OVERHEATING AND EXCESSIVE WEAR ON THE BRAKE PAD AND ROTORS.  IN EXTREME CASES, THIS CAN CAUSE THE ROTOR TO LOCK UP WITH LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL.  IN MY OPINION, THE BRAKES DESIGN IS INSUFFICIENT FOR THE WEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE.  THIS IS CONFIRMED BY THE FACT THAT CHRYSLER REPLACEMENT PROCEDURE/PARTS NOW SPECIFY A SEMI-METALLIC BRAKE PAD, SIMILAR TO WHAT IS OFTEN USED ON RACE CARS TO HANDLE THE EXCESS HEAT.  *TR",
