CALLED DEALER, WANTED $400.00+ TO LOOK AT IT, AND ASKED ABOUT THE ERRATIC DASH ODOMETER ACTIVITY.  WE TOOK IT TO A LOCAL REPAIR SHOP, AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WOULD HAVE DAMAGED THE COMPLETE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IN DASH HAD WE NOT REMOVED THE POWER TO THE HARNESS.  MELTED HARNESS NEARLY COMPLETELY.  ERRATIC GAUGE OPERATION STILL A PROBLEM, IF YOU HIT A BUMP THEY COME BACK ON.  THEY STILL WANT 400+ DOLLARS TO LOOK AT IT AT THE DEALER.  THIS IS ONLY ONE OF MANY PROBLEMS (CONVERTER REPLACED BY DEALER 2 TIMES ALREADY IN 1 AND HALF YEAR, BRAKES DON'T ENGAGE PROPERLY-HAD BRAKE LINES CHECKED REPEATEDLY, ETC). TS",
