THERE IS AN ALTERNATOR RECALL OUT FOR MOST 2012 V6 JEEPS, CHRYSLER, ETC; HOWEVER, I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE RECALL DOES NOT APPLY FOR MY VEHICLE FOR SOME REASON EVEN THOUGH I HAD THE SAME ISSUE AS ALL THE OTHER VEHICLES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL. I AM HOPING THAT THEY DO RIGHT BY THEIR LOYAL CUSTOMERS AND EXPAND THE RECALL TO INCLUDE MY VEHICLE.",
