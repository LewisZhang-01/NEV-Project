IT'S ALWAYS VIBRATED AND I'VE ALWAYS HEARD \"NOISES.\"  THE DEALER DID TRY TO RECTIFY THIS SITUATION BY REPLACING MY RACK AND PINION AND REPLACING MY TIE ROD ENDS, BECAUSE BOTH OF MY FRONT TIRES WERE ABOUT TO FALL OFF.  I'VE EXTREMELY SCARED TO PUT MY CHILDREN IN THIS CAR, BUT HAVE NO CHOICE.  NOW, AS OF TODAY MY EMERGENCY BRAKE LIGHT AND \"TRAC OFF\" LIGHT STAY ON CONSTANTLY.  SO THERE IS JUST ONE MORE PROBLEM TO ADD TO THE LIST OF THINGS THAT HAVE GONE WRONG WITH ONLY 48,000 MILES.  I'VE BEEN EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS SINCE I PURCHASED THE CAR. TS",
