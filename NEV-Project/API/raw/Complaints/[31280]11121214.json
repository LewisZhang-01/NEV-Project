IN JULY 2018, ONE MONTH BEFORE THE FAILURE, WE TOOK THE MINIVAN TO CAPE COD AND BOSTON.  WE HAD 6 PASSENGERS IN THE CAR.  THE FOLLOWING WEEK WE DROVE DOWN TO OCEAN CITY, MD AGAIN WITH THE 6 PEOPLE.  WHEN THE AXLE CRACKED, I WAS PULLING INTO THE DRIVEWAY ABOUT 5 MILES PER HOUR.  WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THE AXLE BROKE ON THOSE TRIPS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND 6 PEOPLE IN THE CAR??
