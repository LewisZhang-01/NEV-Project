THUS, WHILE DRIVING TO WORK TODAY, AFTER HAVING TWO OF THE COILS REPLACED YESTERDAY, ANOTHER COIL FAILED.  NOW I HAVE 3 OF THE 4 COILS WHICH ARE ALLEGEDLY NON-DEFECTIVE.  I ASKED THE DEALER TO REPLACE THE 4TH COIL AND HE REFUSED.  I CALLED VW OF AMERICA AND THEY SAID THAT THEY WILL NOT AUTHORIZE THE REPAIR OF THE 4TH COIL.  I INFORMED THEM OF THE DANGER POSED BY THIS CONDITION, NAMELY THE CAR LOSING POWER ON THE HIGHWAY AND/OR STRANDING PEOPLE IN BAD SITUATIONS.  HE STATED THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND THE DANGERS POSED, BUT WOULD NOT REPLACE ANY PART THAT HAD NOT FAILED.",
