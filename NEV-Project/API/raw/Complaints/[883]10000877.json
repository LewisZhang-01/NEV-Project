CANNOT UNDERSTAND AND OIL CONSUMPTION TEST BY VWOF A IN JULY OF 2002 SAID IT WAS NORMAL EVEN AFTER BREAKIN PERIOD.  CAR CURRENTLY HAS 46,000 MILES.  I AM PISSED OFF STILL AND I AM BASICALLY PUTTING A QUART OF OIL IN EVERY MONTH PLUS 2 OIL CHANGES A YEAR.  THIS NORMAL OIL CONSUMTION IS COSTING A FORTUNE AND THIS WAS NEVER DISCLOSED TO ME WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR NEW.  NO MENTION OF IT IN THE SERVICE MANUAL AND VWOF A HAS A TSB OUT THERE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A NEW ENGINE.",
