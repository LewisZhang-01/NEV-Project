SINCE I WAS TRAVELING AWAY FROM HOME, I TOOK IT TO A DODGE DEALERSHIP WHICH STATED THAT THE CLUTCH IN THE AC COMPRESSOR UNIT WAS FAILING AND COULD CAUSE THE SERPENTINE BELT TO THROW IF THE CLUTCH FROZE.  THE SERVICE MANAGER STATED THAT THIS WAS A \"COMMON PROBLEM\" WITH THE AIR CONDITIONING COMPRESSOR UNIT EVEN WITH THE LOW MILEAGE.  THE DEALERSHIP DIDN'T HAVE A UNIT IN STOCK ON A SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND STATED THAT I SHOULDN'T USE THE AC OR DEFROST ON COLD AND I WOULD BE OK TO DRIVE HOME 300 MILES.  I THANKED THE DEALERSHIP FOR THEIR INSIGHT BUT AM CONCERNED SINCE THE SERVICE MANGER STATED THAT THE AC COMPRESSOR UNIT FAILURE IS \"COMMON\" EVEN WITH 38,000 MILES.   *NLM",
