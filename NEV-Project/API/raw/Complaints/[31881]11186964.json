I HIT A BUMP IN THE ROAD AS I WAS TRAVELING ONTO A BRIDGE AND TRUCK STARTED SHAKING 'DANGEROUSLY' OUT OF CONTROL. THE TRUCK DIDN'T STOP SHAKING UNTIL I SLOWED DOWN TO AROUND 30 MPH.

THE TRUCK SHOOK FOR AT LEAST 5 TO 10 SECONDS AND AFTER GETTING BACK CONTROL OF VEHICLE IT DID THE SAME THING SECONDS LATER. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS COULD HAVE CAUSED ACCIDENT AND LOSS OF LIFE!",
