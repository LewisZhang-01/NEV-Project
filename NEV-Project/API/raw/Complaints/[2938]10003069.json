WE OPENED THE HOOD AT THAT TIME NOTICED FLAMES COMING FROM UNDER NEATH THE DRIVERS SIDE. WE BARELY HAD ENOUGH TIME TO GET OUT BEFORE IT WAS TOTALLY ENGULFED WITH FLAMES. AT THE TIME WE WERE TOWING AN ENCLOSED TRAILER WITH A 2003 HONDA GOLDWING. NOTHING PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENCE GAVE US ANY CLUE THAT THE VAN WAS ON FIRE. WE LOST ALL OUR POSSESSIONS IN THE VAN AND TRAILER. IT WAS ALL 100% DESTROYED. UNKNOWN CAUSE. WE HAD NOTICED THAT WE WERE USING MORE FUEL. AND WHEN WE PULLED THE VAN OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WE NOTICED TRANSMISSION FLUID ON THE GROUND FROM WHERE WE PULLED OVER UNTIL WE GOT STOPPED.",
