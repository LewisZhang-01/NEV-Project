ONE OR THE OTHER PAWL LOCKS INTO PLACE AND A LARGE AMOUNT OF SHIFTING FORCE IS THEN REQUIRED TO MOVE THE SECOND PAWL INTO A POSITION WHERE IT WILL ENGAGE. THIS WOULD ONLY BE A MINOR INCONVENIENCE IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE SEAT BELT CONFIGURATION OF THIS VEHICLE. THIS SEAT BELT ATTACHES NOT TO THE SUB FLOOR OR PILLAR BUT TO THE SEAT ITSELF. IF (AS HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES TO ME) YOU ARE UNDER WAY AND REPOSITION THE SEAT, YOU MAY NOT REALIZE THE SEAT IS NOT SAFELY LOCKED INTO POSITION. IF YOU WERE THEN INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT THE STRAIN ON THE ENGAGED PAWL MIGHT BE BEYOND DESIGN PARAMETERS. WHEN THE UNENGAGED PAWL, TRAVELING TO ITS NEXT LOCKED POSITION UNDER THE FORCES OF THE ACCIDENT, MEET THE MASS OF THE OCCUPANT AND SEAT, THE SHEAR FORCES MAY CAUSE FAILURE OF THE PAWL ALLOWING THE OCCUPANT AND HIS /HER SEAT TO BE UNCONTROLLED DURING AN ACCIDENT. THIS COULD RESULT IN UNNECESSARY INJURY TO THE OCCUPANT. AN AIR BAG SRS COULD EXACERBATE THIS CIRCUMSTANCE CAUSING ESCALATING INJURY(S).",
