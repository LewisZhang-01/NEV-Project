        "summary": "MY 2005 NISSAN XTERRA HAS PROBLEMS WITH THE FUEL SENDING UNIT. THE GAS GAUGE WILL READ AT A QUARTER OF A TANK, WHEN IN FACT THERE IS NO GAS AT ALL. IT SEEMS THIS OCCURS VERY OFTEN IS OTHER MODELS OLDER AND NEWER, HOWEVER THE WARRANTY IS ONLY COVERED UP TO 36000 MILES. IT SEEMS TO BE THAT MOST PEOPLE COME ACROSS THIS ISSUE WELL AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRES. I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY SHAME WITH NISSAN FOR NOT BACKING THEIR PRODUCTS AND PUTTING DEALERSHIPS UNDER THE PRESSURE TO CHARGE CUSTOMERS TO REPLACE THESE FAULTY ITEMS, WHEN IT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE FOR THE SAFETY OF THEIR CONSUMERS WITH RELIABLE PARTS. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN \"WEAR AND TEAR\" THAT ALL CARS INCUR, BUT FAULTY FUEL SENDING UNITS? I CAN BE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT A COMMON WEAR AND TEAR ITEM BECAUSE IF IT WAS, OTHER MAKES AND MODELS WOULD NEED TO REPLACE IT MORE OFTEN OR WITHIN THE 36000 MILE CRITERIA.   *TR",
