THE VEHICLE IS DRIVEN GENTLY IN A COMBINATION OF CITY AND OPEN ROAD DRIVING, WITHOUT ANY UNUSUAL BRAKING REQUIREMENTS.  WE LIVE NEAR SOME MOUNTAINS, BUT THIS VEHICLE IS ALMOST NEVER DRIVEN IN THE MOUNTAINS.   THERE HAVE BEEN NO UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT MIGHT HAVE DAMAGED THE BRAKES.   THEREFORE THE PAD AND/OR ROTOR ARE DEFECTIVE IN DESIGN OR MANUFACTURER.  THERE IS NO WAY THAT TOTAL WEAR OF THE BRAKES SHOULD OCCUR IN ONLY 15,000 MILES OF NORMAL DRIVING.*JB",
