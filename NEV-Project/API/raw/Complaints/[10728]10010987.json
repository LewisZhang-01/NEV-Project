SUBSEQUENTLY, I READ AN ARTICLE IN A NEWSPAPER THAT SAID THE NHTSA WAS INVESTIGATING GM CARS WITH THE 3.8 LITER ENGINES FOR ENGINE FIRES THAT RESULTED FROM THESE PROBLEMS WITH THE PLASTIC INTAKE MANIFOLD.  I AM WONDERING IF A RECALL HAS BEEN/COULD BE ISSUED, OR IF THERE IS ANY WAY OWNERS OF CARS WITH THESE ENGINES CAN BE REIMBURSED FOR THE MASSIVE REPAIR BILLS RESULTING FROM THIS ENGINEERING DEFECT.  OF COURSE I AM ALSO VERY CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY SINCE I HAVE LEARNED OF THE PROPENSITY FOR FIRES WITH THESE ENGINES.  THANK YOU.",
