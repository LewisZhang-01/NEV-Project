        "summary": "THE CAR HAD BEEN STALLING FOR MORE THAN A YEAR BUT NOT AS FREQUENT.  THE MOST DANGEROUS TIME IT STALLED WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF INTERSTATE 240N. MY WIFE AND CHILD WAS WITH ME.  IT WAS RUSH HOUR AND THERE WERE LOTS OF TRAFFIC.  WE WERE TERRIFIED!  ONCE I MERGED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY, WE HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES BEFORE THE CAR STARTED AGAIN.  MIND YOU, WE ARE ON THE SIDE OF A BUSY AND DANGEROUS INTERSTATE HIGHWAY.  I NOTICED WHEN  I TRIED TO START THE CAR AFTER IT HAD STALLED,  THE THEFT SYSTEM LIGHT WAS FLASHING.   I HAD NO IDEA WHY THE THEFT SYSTEM LIGHT WAS FLASHING OR IF IT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE CAR NOT STARTING.  I CALLED A TECHNICIAN I KNOW AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT THE CAR SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS TO START BUT KEEP STALLING.  HE ASKED ME TO LOOK AT THE DASH AND TELL HIM WHAT I SAW.  THE THEFT SYSTEM LIGHT WAS FLASHING, IT REMAINED ON FOR A WHILE, THEN IT WENT OUT AFTER ABOUT 15 MINUTES.  HE TOLD ME TO TRY TO START THE CAR AGAIN.  IT STARTED.  THIS (THE CAR STALLS, WAIT AWHILE, THEN IT STARTS) WENT ON FOR AWHILE.  ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2009, I WENT OUT TO START THE CAR TO TAKE MY CHILD TO SCHOOL AND THE CAR WOULD NOT START.    TO THIS DAY, I CAN NOT GET MY CAR TO START AND THE THEFT SYSTEM LIGHT IS STILL FLASHING.  THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE I KNOW WHO OWN BUICK SKYLARKS AND ARE HAVING SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THE THEFT SYSTEM.  SOME HAVE GOTTEN SEVERAL THINGS REPLACED SUCH AS THE KEY, THE SWITCH, ETC AND HAVE YET TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM CORRECTED.  IT SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH THE BUICK SKYLARKS THEFT SYSTEM MANUFACTURED AROUND 1997!  IS THERE ANYTHING BEING DONE OR WILL THERE BE SOMETHING DONE TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM?  THIS COULD CAUSE SERIOUS INJURIES AND/OR DEATHS! *TR",
