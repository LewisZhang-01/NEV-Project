THEIR HAVE ALSO BEEN TIMES WHEN I STEPPED ON THE BRAKE BUT THE CAR DID NOT SLOW DOWN AS EXPECTED.  I HAD TO PUMP THE BRAKES TO RE-ENGAGE THEM.  ONCE THIS CAUSED ME TO ROLL INTO AN INTERSECTION WHICH LUCKILY NO OTHER CARS WERE NEAR ME.    NOW MY FRONT LEFT WHEEL HAS STARTED MAKING LOUD SWOOSHING AND SCREECHING NOISES.  THE FASTER I DRIVE THE LOUDER THE NOISE GETS.   THE SQUEAK IN THE LEFT FRONT TIRE IS ALSO PRESENT WHEN DRIVING IN NEUTRAL.  I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT TO GET THE CAR SERVICED ON WEDNESDAY.      EVEN AFTER SERVICING IT MAKES ME NERVOUS THAT MY CAR IS NOT SAFE.",
