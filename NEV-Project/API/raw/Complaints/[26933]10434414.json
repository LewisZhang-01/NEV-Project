        "summary": "MY 2008 SATURN OUTLOOK LOST BOTH HEADLIGHTS IN DECEMBER 2010 WITHIN A COUPLE OF DAYS OF EACH OTHER.  THE DEALER INFORMED US THE BULBS HAD BURNED OUT AND WHEN THEY BURNED OUT THEY BURNED/CORRODED THE WIRING HARNESSES CONNECTED TO THEM, NECESSITATING A $200 REPAIR.  LESS THAN A YEAR LATER, IN NOVEMBER 2011, THE RIGHT HEADLIGHT WENT OUT AGAIN.  WHEN WE TOOK IT TO THE DEALER ON NOVEMBER 4, 2011, THEY INFORMED US THE BULB HAD BURNED OUT AND THE HARNESS HAD BURNED OUT AGAIN, AND SAID THE REPAIR WOULD BE MORE THAN $200.  WE HAVE SEEN THIS PROBLEM DOCUMENTED BY MANY SATURN OWNERS ON SATURN FAN SITES, AND ALSO READ TO CONTACT NHTSA TO NOTIFY YOU OF THIS COMMON AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SAFETY PROBLEM WITH THE SATURN OUTLOOK SO THAT YOU COULD CONSIDER ORDERING GM TO RECALL THESE VEHICLES.  I HOPE YOU WILL ORDER A RECALL AND ORDER GM TO SOLVE AN UNNECESSARY DESIGN PROBLEM THAT IS A NUISANCE AT BEST AND COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO A FIRE OR LOST VISIBILITY THAT COULD RESULT IN ACCIDENTS AT WORST.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.  *TR",
