FAILED DUE TO VEHICLE WILL MOVE FORWARD EVEN THOUGH EMERGENCY BRAKE IS ENGAGED. INSPECTOR COMMENTED THAT MANY GMC SIERRAS ARE FAILING DUE TO THIS REASON. CONTACTED DEALERSHIP SERVICE ADVISOR WHO ALSO AGREED WITH STATEMENT. HE SAID GMC WAS REPAIRING AT NO COST THOSE VEHICLES THAT HAD 36,000 MILES OR LESS. SINCE OURS HAS 55,000 MILES RECOMMENDED CONTACTING GMC. CONTACTED GMC WHO SAID THEY HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF THIS BEING A COMMON PROBLEM, BUT ARE REPAIRING VEHICHLES IF LESS THAN 23.000 MILES WITH THIS PROBLEM AT NO CHARGE. IN ADDITION GMC SAID PROBLEM IS DUE TO THE WEARING OF EMERGENCY BRAKE PADS. COMPLAINT #8006225 IS SIMILAR TO OURS.",
