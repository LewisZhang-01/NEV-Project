THE POWER STEERING BEGAN WORKING AGAIN, BUT THEN CUT OUT AGAIN AFTER A FEW MILES WHILE STILL DRIVING. THIS OCCURS EVERY TIME I DRIVE THE CAR; WORKS, CUTS OUT, I RESTART THE VEHICLE, POWER STEERING BEGINS WORKING, THEN CUTS OUT AGAIN....EVERYTIME I DRIVE!! MY MECHANIC HAS TRIED REPLACING THE COMPUTER CHIP AND EVERYTHING SHORT OF DISMANTLING THE VEHICLE. HE INFORMED ME THAT HE DISCOVERED THAT THOUSANDS OF COBALT OWNERS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. UNFORTUNATELY, GM REFUSES TO DO A RECALL DESPITE THE DANGER OF THE FAILURE. THE POWER STEERING COLUMN NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. I AM HOPING GM WILL STEP UP TO ASSIST THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT CANNOT AFFORD THIS REPAIR. *TR",
