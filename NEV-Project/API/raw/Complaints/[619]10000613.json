THESE COMPONENTS FAIL WITHOUT WARNING CAUSING THE CAR TO STALL AND/OR LOSE POWER DRAMATICALLY AND CAN CAUSE THE DRIVER TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. VW HAS STATED THAT THEY KNOW THE COMPONENTS ARE BAD (4 PER ENGINE) BUT WILL ONLY FIX THESE ITEMS AS THEY FAIL. I PERSONALLY HAVE HAD THIS FAILURE TWICE AND THEY WILL NOT CORRECT ALL OF THE COMPONENTS. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS AND FORCE VW TO RECALL ALL OF THESE VEHICLES AND REPLACE ALL OF THESE KNOW BAD COMPONENTS.",
