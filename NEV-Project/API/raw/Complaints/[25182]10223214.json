        "summary": "MY HONDA ACCORD 2002, WITH 65,000 MILES, STARTED TO JERK FORWARD, WHEN STOPPED ON A RED LIGHT YOU FEEL THE CAR WANTS TO JUMP FORWARD, SEVERAL TIMES I WAS AFRAID OF REAR ENDING OTHER CARS IN FRONT OF ME, SO I TRIED TO KEEP EXTRA DISTANCE FROM THE OTHER CARS. ANYWAY, I TOOK THE CAR TO AUTO REPAIR SHOP \"MERCHANTS\" AND I ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE CAR, THEY RECOMMENDED FLUSHING ALL THE FLUIDS (OIL, BRAKE FLUID, TRANS FLUID, RADIATOR), THE COST TO ME WAS ABOUT $800 WHICH INCLUDED NEW BRAKE PADS. THE CAR DROVE OK FOR COUPLE THOUSAND MILES, THEN IT STARTED THE SLIPPING, JERKING AGAIN. AT ABOUT 70,000 MILES I TOOK THE CAR FOR OIL CHANGE AT GOOD YEAR WHERE THEY TOLD ME THAT TRAN'S FLUID IS, DIRTY (BLACK) AND THEY RECOMMENDED FLUSHING THE TRANS. I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO \"MERCHANTS\" AND SHOWED THEM THE REPORT FROM GOOD YEAR, THE SAID THAT THEY WILL REPEAT THE JOB (FLUSHING THE FLUIDS) AT NO CHARGE. AFTER FLUSHING THE TRANS FOR THE SECOND TIME, THE CAR DROVE OK FOR FEW DAYS, THEN IT STARTED JERKING, SLIPPING, AND SPECIALLY WHEN I MAKE A TURN THE CAR WILL SLOW DOWN AS IF THE GEAR IS NOT ENGAGED, WHEN I PUSH ON THE GAS I GET NO REACTION (SPEED WISE), SOME TIMES I HAVE TO SWITCH BETWEEN  DIFFERENT GEARS TO GET IT ENGAGED, RECENTLY, MANY TIMES I HAVE TO GO TO FULL STOP AND SHIFT INTO P THEN TO D FRO THE GEAR TO GET ENGAGED. THE SITUATION WAS VERY DANGEROUS SEVERAL TIMES AND ABOUT TO CAUSE ACCIDENTS, FOR SURE ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF OTHER DRIVERS AND MANY OF THEM SHOWED ANGRY GESTURES. IT IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN ANY TIME I DRIVE THE HONDA ACCORD. COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, THE TCS LIGHT CAME ON FOR LONG TIME, YESTERDAY THE TCS LIGHT WENT OFF, BUT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND STAYED ON. I AM NOT SURE WHAT IS THE PROBLEM, BUT I AM CONVINCED THAT THE TRANS IS FAILING, I HOPE THAT HONDA WILL HONOR A TRANS REPLACEMENT, SINCE THE CAR IS LOW MILEAGE, ABOUT 72,000 MILES. I WILL BE TAKING THE CAR TOMORROW TO A HONDA DEALER IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA.  *TR",
