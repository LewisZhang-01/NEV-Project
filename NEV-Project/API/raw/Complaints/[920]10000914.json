        "summary": "I HAVE A 2002 VW GTI 337 THAT WAS PURCHASED ON 7/2/02.  I HAD 7777 MILES WHEN A COILPACK WENT OUT RENDERING THE CAR UNDRIVABLE.  VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA KNOWS THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THEIR COILPACKS AND HAVE NOT ISSUED A RECALL ON THEM.  IF MY WIFE WERE IN THE CAR WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND SHE WAS LEFT STRANDED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, NO TELLING WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED.  RIGHT NOW VW WILL ONLY REPLACE THE BAD COILBACK BUT NOT THE OTHER THREE (4 CYL).  SO DRIVING THE CAR IS THIS STATE WILL ONLY POSE ANOTHER RISK FOR FUTURE PROBLEMS AND HAZZARDS. ALSO NOTE THAT THERE IS A NATIONAL BACKORDER ON THESE PARTS AND I HAVE YET TO GET A REPLACEMENT FOR THE ONE THAT WENT OUT AT 7777 MILES.  LUCKLY I HAVE A LOANER FROM A FRIEND BUT WITHOUT THAT, MY CAR WOULD BE A GIANT PAPERWEIGHT.  PLEASE FORCE VWOA TO RECALL THESE COILPACKS.  EVERYTIME I'M ON A ROAD TRIP I WORRY ABOUT ONE OF THE OTHER THREE GOING OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.  AND IF I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BREAK DOWN NEAR A DEALER, THE CHANCES OF THEM HAVING A REPLACEMENT IS LIKE ME WINNING THE LOTTERY.",
