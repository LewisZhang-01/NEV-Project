MY HUSBAND CAME TO HELP ME AND IT FINALLY STARTED BUT IT HAD A SEVERE KNOCK IN IT. HE TOOK IT TO THE GARGAE FOR REPAIR AND WAS TOLD IT WAS THE ENGINE. NO WARNING PF ANY SORT. IT HAD GREAT OIL PRESSURE , CHNAGED FREQUENTLY, COOLANT WAS FINE ETC. WE WERE TOLD THAT IT HAS A BULLETIN OUT ON IT FOR THIS VERY PROBLEM BUT NO RECALL. WE NOW HAVE HEARD OF 3 OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME IDENTICAL PROBLEM AROUND OUR SMALL COMMUNITY. FORD SAYS THEY WILL DO NOTHING ABOUT IT AS IT IS JUST A BULLETIN NOT A RECALL PROBLEM. THE GARAGES AROUND HERE HAVE TOLD US THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS ENGINE. IF FORDS WOULD EVEN PAY HALF OF THE $3600 REPAIR WE WOULD BE SATISIFED BUT THEY TELL US NO.",
