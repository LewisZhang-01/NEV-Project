IT ALSO DOES NOT WANT TO START AT TIMES JUST DOING SOUND AND AFTER TRYING ABOUT 5 MIN IT'S STARTING( THIS PROBLEM WAS FROM TIME WHEN I BOUGHT THIS BRAND NEW CAR IN 2003). DEALER COULD NOT FIND AND FIX THIS PROBLEM IN 2003 WHEN I HAD WARRANTY. THEY TOLD ME IF CAR STARTS THEY CAN'T READ A CODE , BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A   \"CHECK ENGINE\" MESSAGE. DEALER CHARGED ME $300 FOR TUNE UP. NOW WHEN MY CAR START TO STALLS I WENT AGAIN AND STILL DOES NOT HAVE \"CHECK ENGINE\" MESSAGE, BUT THEY REPLACED \"CRANKSHAFT SENSOR\" AND LOOKS LIKE IT WORKS. ANOTHER $300. I CHECK AT NISSANCLUB.COM FORUM AND REALIZE THAT IT'S COMMON  PROBLEM FOR NISSAN ALTIMA. BUT MY MODEL 2003 DOES NOT HAVE ANY RECALL. NISSAN SUPPOSED FIX THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IT CAN HURT SOME ONE.       *JB",
