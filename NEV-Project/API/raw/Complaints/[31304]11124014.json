I TALKED TO OTHER OWNERS AND FOUND THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE.  BEING THAT MY VEHICLE IS NOT RUSTY AND IS CARED FOR REGULARLY THIS IS BAD AND I AM NO LONGER GOING TO INVEST MY MONEY INTO IT.  THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN AND I FEEL WITH AS COMMON AS THE ISSUE SEEMS IT SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF BY FORD AS THE SHOCK BEING LOOSE COMING INTO THE INTERIOR IS ANOTHER SAFETY CONCERN, AND THE WEAR AND TEAR FROM THE TIRE RIDE CAUSES PREMATURE TIRE WEAR NOT TO MENTION WEAR AND SNAPPING THE BREAK LINE CAUSING THE BRAKES TO FAIL.",
