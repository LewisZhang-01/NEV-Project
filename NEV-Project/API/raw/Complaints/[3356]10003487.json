THE NEXT MORNING I TOOK THE CAR TO MY MECHANIC WHO LATER INFORMED ME THAT THE HEAD GASKET HAD FAILED, COOLANT HAD LEAKED INTO AT LEAST ONE CYLINDER AND THE TIMING CHAIN.  I CONTACTED FORD BECAUSE I HAD RECEIVED A NOTICE OF AN EXTENSION TO THE WARRANTY FOR THIS VERY PROBLEM.  HOWEVER FORD ONLY EXTENDED THE WARRANTY TO 7 YEARS AND 100,000 MILES.  THIS VEHICLE HAS 98,000 MILES ON IT AND IS 8 YEARS AND 3 MONTHS OLD. AS A RESULT FORD WILL NOT SERVICE THE CAR UNDER THE WARRANTY EXTENSION.  MY MECHANIC TELLS ME THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH THIS PARTICULAR FORD ENGINE AND THAT HE HAS HAD TO REPLACE THE HEAD GASKET ON NUMEROUS VEHICLES WITHT HIS ENGINE.",
