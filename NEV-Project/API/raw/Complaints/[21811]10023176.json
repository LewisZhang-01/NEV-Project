        "summary": "ON JUNE 1, 2003, MY CAR HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE DEALER FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE IGNITION CYLINDER WHICH WAS DONE ON JUNE 2, 2003 AT STONEHAM MOTOR CO.  I PREVIOUSLY HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALER FOR THE SAME PROBLEM AND SAME REPAIR ON TWO OTHER OCCASIONS -- FEBRUARY 11, 2003 AND APRIL 21, 2003.  THIS WAS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN A COMPLAINT TO YOUR AGENCY (CONFIRMATION NO. 10018431).  THE DEALER ATTEMPTED TO REPLACE THE STEERING COLUMN SO THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM AGAIN, BUT WAS UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS SUCCESSFULLY.  ALTHOUGH A NEW IGNITION CYLINDER WAS INSTALLED, I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS PROBLEM MAY CONTINUE TO OCCUR REPEATEDLY BECAUSE OF A DESIGN DEFECT WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE THE KEY TO BE INSERTED FULLY.  THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER TOLD ME THAT ONE CONSUMER WITH A SIMILAR PROBLEM LEAVES HIS KEY IN THE IGNITION, THINKING THAT IF THE CAR GETS STOLEN THAT WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  HE SAID THAT ANOTHER CONSUMER HAS A HAMMER IN HIS CAR WHICH HE USES TO TAP THE KEY BEFORE TURNING IT.  I HAVE NO COMPLAINT WITH THE DEALER WHO PERFORMED ALL THREE REPAIRS AT NO CHARGE, BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD HAVE SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PROBLEM, BOTH TO ME AND MY DEALER.   *NLM",
