NOW WITH 83000 MILES THE TRANSMISSION DID THE SAME THING. IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE SUN SHELLS? IS ANYONE ELSE HAVING THIS PROBLEM. ALL OF MY MILES ARE HIGHWAY MILES AND I HAVE ALL MY MAINTANENCE RECORDS TO PROVE THAT I DO SCHEDULED MAINTANENCE ON MY VEHICLE. I ALSO DO NOT ABUSE MY VEHICLE AND DO NOT TOW ANYTHING. I'LL GO BROKE IF THE VEHICLE REQUIRES A NEW TRANSMISSION EVERY 40000 MILES. EACH TIME IT COST APPROX. $4,000.00 TO FIX. CAN ANYONE HELP? THANK YOU",
