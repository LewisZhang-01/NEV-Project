I WAS TOLD EVERY TIME THAT THE BRAKES WERE FINE, BUT THE NOISE STILL CONTINUES. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY COMPLAINTS OR RECALLS ON THE BRAKE SYSTEM FOR THESE VEHICLES. SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTS OR FATALITIES. HOWEVER, I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS MORE TO THE NOISE IN THE BRAKES THAN JUST THE FACT THAT THE PADS HAVE METAL IN THEM, WHICH IS WHAT THE DEALERSHIP SAYS TO ME EVERY TIME I TAKE IT IN FOR SERVICE. MY OTHER CHIEF COMPLAINT IS THAT THE VAN HAD A CHRYSLER NAME PLATE ON IT, BUT IT WASN'T A CARAVAN IT TURNED OUT TO BE A PLYMOUTH VOYAGER. IS THAT LEGAL? HAD I KNOWN THAT IT WAS A PLYMOUTH I NEVER WOULD HAVE PURCHASED IT.      *NLM",
