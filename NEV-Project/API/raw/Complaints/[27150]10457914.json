        "summary": "MY 2008 HONDA CIVIC HAS A NOTORIOUS PROBLEM: DEFECTIVE SUN VISORS THAT DROP DOWN, COVERING MORE THAN HALF THE VERTICAL SPACE OF THE WINDSHIELD IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER. THE PROBLEM, WHICH INVOLVES A METAL BAR THAT EXPANDS IN HOT WEATHER AND FORCES APART THE TWO SIDES OF THE PLASTIC VISOR, IS PRONE TO HAPPEN IN HOT WEATHER. THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME. A CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT RULING REQUIRES HONDA TO REPLACE THESE AS NEEDED UP TO 100,000 MILES. HOWEVER, THE SAFETY ISSUE REMAINS UNADDRESSED. THE REPLACEMENT IS THE SAME AS THE FAILED VISOR, AND IT TOO WILL FAIL IN ABOUT 10,000 MILES (OR LESS, IN SEVERE CLIMATES).     TWO SCREWS HOLD THE VISOR TO THE ROOF OF THE CAR. CAN'T HONDA BE REQUIRE TO DESIGN A NEW VISOR WITHOUT THIS DEFECT (REQUIRES ONLY MAKING THE CHANNEL FOR THE METAL BAR WIDER) AND REPLACE THE VISORS WITH AN IMPROVED VERSION ON ALL AFFECTED HONDA CIVICS (2006-2009)? IT IS NOT FUN VIEWING THE ROAD AHEAD BY PEEKING AROUND AND UNDER THE DROPPED VISOR. HONDA CIVICS HAVE A SEVERELY SLANTED WINDSHIELD, AND THE VERTICAL VIEWING SPACE IS LIMITED WITHOUT A FAILED VISOR.  *TR",
