ON THE DATE BELOW, I HAD MY SON IN A FORWARD FACING CAR SEAT IN THE MIDDLE REAR SEAR.  I PARKED AND UNCLIPPED MY SEAT BELT AND OPENED THE TRUNK.  I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND SHUT THE DOOR BUT DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THE SEAT BELT WAS PUSHING AGAINST THE SEAT BACK SWITCH AND LOWERED THE SEAT BACK ALL THE WAY DOWN.  IT CAUGHT MY SON'S FOOT BETWEEN HIS CAR SEAT AND THE SEAT BACK.  HE WAS NOT SERIOUSLY HURT, BUT THIS COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE.  IT ONLY TOOK THE TIME FROM ME TO GET OUT OF THE CAR AND GO TO THE TRUNK TO RETRIEVE HIS STROLLER FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.",
