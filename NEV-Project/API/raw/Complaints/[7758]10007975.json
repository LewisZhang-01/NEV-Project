THE CAR CONTINUED TO DO THIS AND THEN IT STARTED TO UPSHIFT THEN SUDDENLY DOWNSHIFT TO THE LOWER GEAR CAUSING A VERY SUDDEN JERK AND CHANGE IN SPEED.  I TOOK MY CAR TO HONDA OF CLEVELAND IN CLEVELAND, TN.  I TOLD THEM WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY SUGGESTED TO HAVE A DIAGNOSTIC TEST RUN.  I AGREED AND THE RESULTS WERE CODES P700 AND P730 INTERNAL FAILURE AND INCORRECT GEAR NEEDS TRANSMISSION OVERHAUL OR REPLACEMENT.  I WAS SHOCKED WHEN THE SERVICE ADVISOR TOLD ME THIS.  I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED. I ASKED HIM IF IT COULD BE A DEFECTIVE PART.   HE ANSWERED NO.   I ASKED IF IT COULD BE COMPUTER RELATED AND HE SAID NO THAT IT WAS A FAILURE INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION.  I ASKED HIM WHAT FAILED.  HE COULDN'T TELL ME.  HE JUST TOLD ME WHAT THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST CAME UP WITH.  THE SERVICE QUOTE FOR A REMANUFACTURED  TRANSMISSION INSTALLED WAS FOR $5365.26  WHEN I HEARD THIS QUOTE I SAID \"IS THIS MADE OUT OF GOLD\".   I TOLD HIM THE REASON I BOUGHT A HONDA WAS TO AVOID PROBLEMS LIKE THIS.  I ALSO HAD ASKED THE SERVICE PERSON IF HE HAD HEARD OF OTHER PEOPLE WITH THIS TYPE OF CAR HAVING THIS PROBLEM AND HE SAID HE HADN'T.  AFTER SEEING THIS SITE AND OTHERS I REALIZED THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM.  I HOPE THIS COMPLAINT HELPS.",
