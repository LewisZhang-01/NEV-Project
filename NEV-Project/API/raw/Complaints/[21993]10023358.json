THE RECALL RELATES TO FAULTY WIPER MOTOR CIRCUIT BOARDS THAT LEAD TO INTERMITTENT OPERATION OF WIPER BLADES. I OWN A 1998 CHEVROLET S-10 VIN NUMBER [XXX] AND HAVE EXPERIENCED NUMEROUS FAILURES OF THE WIPER BLADES DURING RAIN STORMS. THE MOST SEVERE INCIDENT HAPPENED DURING HEAVY RAINS TODAY, WHEN I LOST THE USE OF MY WIPERS FOR 10 MINUTES. I HAVE DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM TO MECHANICS WHO INFORMED ME OF THE RECALL AND INDICATED THAT IT IS MOST LIKELY THE SAME PROBLEM AS THAT OF THE RECALL. THE RECALL SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO MODEL YEAR 1998 AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.   *NLM    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
