TWO DIFFERENT SATURN DEALERS HAVE REPEATEDLY INVESTIGATED AND FOUND \"COMPUTER DIAGNOSTIC CODES\" PROVING THAT \"SOMETHING\" DID HAPPEN, BUT REPEATEDLY SAY THAT THERE IS NEITHER DIAGNOSIS OF THE ROOT CAUSE NOR CURE THAT CAN BE APPLIED, OTHER THAN THE BAND-AID OF \"RESETTING THE COMPUTER\" AND TELLING ME TO GO ON MY WAY, THAT WILL BE FIFTY BUCKS PLEASE. IN TWO CASES THIS PROBLEM CAUSED A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN REQUIRING THE CAR TO BE TOWED.*JB",
