THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE ENGINE DIED WHILE DRIVING THAT FAST, IT USUALLY DIES UNDER 30 MPH.  I SHIFTED TO NEUTRAL AND TRIED TO START IT BUT IT WOULDN'T START.  I HAD TO MAKE A VERY HASTY EXIT TO THE CENTER STRIP AS THERE WAS ANOTHER TRUCK ON MY RIGHT.  IT IS VERY \"EXCITING\" TO PULL ON TO THE GRASS AT (BY THIS TIME) AROUND 55 WITH A HUGE TRUCK TAKING ALL OF THE VIEW IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR.   *NLM",
