THIS PAST JULY I PICKED MY GRANDCHILDREN UP AT CAMP SURE ENOUGH IT DID IT AGAIN ALMOST STRIKING A CHILD IN THE PARKING LOT.  BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND $800.00 DOLLARS LATER FOUND OUT IT WAS THE THROTTLE BODY.  THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS WITH THIS SAME ISSUE.  NEEDS TO BE A RECALL!!!   THIS IS NO DIFFERENT THAN THE TOYOTA SITUATION. *TR",
