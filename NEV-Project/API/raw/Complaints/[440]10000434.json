PREVIOUS OWNER REPORTED THAT THEY HAD REPLACED THE VC PRIOR TO SELLING TO ME (<120,000 MI).  I HAD TO REPLACE IT AGAIN IN NOVEMBER 2001 (~130,000 MILES).  PROBLEM IS STARTED TO ACT UP AGAIN AT ~144,000 MILES DURING A LONG TRIP (~1000 MILES) AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  THIS CAR IS VERY WELL MAINTAINED, AND AT THIS POINT, I'M CONVINCED THAT THERE IS A DESIGN DEFECT WITH THE CAR.  WHEN THE VC LOCKS UP, IT IS MORE DANGEROUS TO DRIVE THE CAR DUE TO THE POOR HANDLING THAT RESULTS. TS",
