        "summary": "EVENFLO TRIBUTE, MODEL #3792098; MANUFACTURER. DATE 16 DECEMBER 2002.  WHILE WORKING AT A CPS SEAT CHECK EVENT THIS WEEKEND, WE HAD A 6 MONTH OLD, 21 LB. BABY THAT CAME IN A REAR-FACING INFANT SEAT.  THE INFANT HAD OUT GROWN THIS SEAT, SO WE WERE GOING TO GIVE THEM A NEW CONVERTIBLE SEAT.   THE SEATS WE HAD ON HAND WERE EVENFLO TRIBUTE, MODEL #3792098; MANUFACTURER. DATE DECEMBER 16, 2002.  *JB  THE STRAPS, AS DESIGNED FOR REAR-FACING INFANT WERE MUCH TOO TIGHT FOR THE BABY.  WE COULD NOT ADJUST THE STRAPS AT ALL TO LOOSEN THEM.  WE READ THE MANUFACTURER INSTRUCTIONS THOROUGHLY BUT COULD NOT FIND ANOTHER WAY TO ADJUST THE STRAPS TO ALLOW THE BABY TO FIT IN THE SEAT.    WE DID HOWEVER, CHANGE THE STRAPS ON THE SPLITTER PLATE TO THE \"FORWARD-FACING ONLY\" NOTCH.  WHILE WE KNEW THIS WAS NOT THE PROPER THING TO DO, WE THOUGHT IF WE COULD GET THEM TIGHT ENOUGH ON THE BABY, IT WOULD BE BETTER THAN SENDING THE BABY AWAY IN THE CURRENT SEAT SHE HAD OUT GROWN.  THIS DID NOT WORK EITHER, AS THEN THE STRAPS COULD NOT BE ADJUSTED TIGHT ENOUGH.  WE ULTIMATELY HAD TO SEND THE BABY AWAY IN THE INFANT SEAT AND ADVISED THE PARENTS TO PURCHASE A SEAT THAT WOULD FIT THE BABY, ADVISING NOT TO BUY AN EVENFLO TRIBUTE.  WE HAVE 12 OF THESE CONVERTIBLE SEATS ON HAND TO BE USED FOR FUTURE CPS EVENTS.  HOWEVER, WHILE THEY ARE FINE FOR USE AS A FORWARD FACING SEAT, WE FEEL THERE IS NO WAY IT CAN ACTUALLY BE USED AS A REAR-FACING INFANT SEAT DUE TO THE STRAPS DESIGNED AS THEY ARE.  WE FEEL THIS NEEDS TO BE CHECKED FOR POSSIBLE RECALL.*JB",
