        "summary": "DRIVING MY 2010 FORD ESCAPE ON HIGHWAY AT 55 MPH IN HEAVY TRAFFIC WHEN THE ENGINE STOPPED RUNNING.  WAS LUCKY TO GET OFF HIGHWAY.  TRIED TO START CAR FOR 10 MINUTES, FINALLY STARTED.  WENT A FEW MILES AND MOTOR CUT OFF AGAIN IN HEAVY TRAFFIC AND COST INTO SHOPPING CENTER.  AFTER ANOTHER 10 MINUTES IT STARTED AND WAS ABLE TO GET IT HOME.  I WAS LUCKY THAT I WAS NEAR HOME AND NOT ON A TRIP.  WAS ABLE TO GET IT TO FORD DEALER WHERE I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE THROTTLE BODY ASSEMBLY AND NOT COVERED UNDER FACTORY WARRANTY EVEN THOUGH IN THE OWNER'S GUIDE THE LIGHT FOR THE \"WRENCH\" (WHICH CAME ON WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT) INDICATES \"THROTTLE CONTROL/POWERTRAIN\".  MY POWERTRAIN WARRANTY IS STILL IN EFFECT.  I WAS TOLD THAT \"THEY\" HAD SEEN THIS BEFORE AND JUST GOT A SHIPMENT IN WITH MANY \"THROTTLE BODIES\".  THE COST TO ME WAS $761.62 (PARTS $432.02).  I TALKED TO MY MECHANIC AND HE SAID THAT HE HAS SEEN THIS A NUMBER OF TIMES ON 2010-2012 ESCAPES AND SENT EVERYONE TO FORD BECAUSE HE CAN'T FIX IT.  NOT ONLY IS THIS AN APPARENT RECURRING PROBLEM IT IS ALSO A SAFETY ISSUE.  *TR",
