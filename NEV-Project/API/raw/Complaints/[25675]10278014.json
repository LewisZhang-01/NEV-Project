THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT REALIGNED THE FRONT END, THAT THE FRAME NEEDS TO BE WELDED AND IT WAS GOING TO COST ME 2,500.00 . SO I PARK THE TRUCK BECAUSE IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE. THE OTHER DAY I WENT TO MOVE THE TRUCK AND THE STEERING BOX FELL OFF THE FRAME, AND THE CRACK IN THE FRAME ON THE TRUCK GOT BIGGER. I HAVE TO STRAP THE STEERING BOX TO THE FRAME TO GET IT MOVED WE I CALLED DODGE ABOUT IF THERE WAS ANY RECALLS ON THE FRAME THEY SAID NO, THEY ASK ME HOW MANY MILES WERE ON THE TRUCK AND I SAID WHAT DOES THAT HAVE ANY THING DO WITH IT. AT THIS POINT THE TRUCK IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND I 'M STILL PAYING THE LOAD ON IT. I NEED SOME HELP ON WHAT TO DO AT THIS POINT. I FEEL DODGE SHOULD REPAIR IT, SINCE ON THE NEWER TRUCK THEY REINFORCED THE FRAME WHERE THE STEERING BOX IS ON THE FRAME. IF I CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE TRUCK AND THE  FRAME CRACKS IN HALF IT WILL CAUSE ME TO CRASH, I'LL LOOSE MY STEERING. I NEED HELP *TR",
