        "summary": "OIL COILER LINES LEAKED FROM THE DAY I BOUGHT IT FROM THE DEALER.  DEALER DEFINITELY KNEW AND CLEANED IT UP BEFORE I GOT IT.  1ST SET OF LINES FROM RADIATOR TO OIL FILTER REPLACED A FEW MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE IN 2001.  SECOND SET FROM FILTER TO MOTOR NOW NEED REPLACING.   EVIDENTLY, THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM.    WIPERS HAVE THEIR OWN AGENDA.  WITH THE MIST SETTING TO CLEAN WINDOWS, WIPERS STAY ON FOR AS LONG AS THEY WANT.  WITH THE SECOND MIST, THEY DON'T STAY ON AS LONG.  BY THE THIRD MIST, WIPERS ACT NORMAL.  ALWAYS HAPPENS.    TURN SIGNAL FLASHER SOUND STARTED WITHOUT THE USE OF THE TURN SIGNAL.  IT STAYS ON FOR RANDOM LENGTHS OF TIME, AND MAKES THE SOUND IN REGULAR, AND IRREGULAR PATTERNS.  REPLACING MULTIFUNCTION SWITCH - AS SEVERAL HAVE BEFORE ME.  DEALER KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.    TRANFER CASE LEAKS LUBE.  4-WHEEL DRIVE MESSED UP BECAUSE OF EMPTY CASE.  ADDED LUBE AND HOPE NO TRANMISSION PROBLEMS ARRISE.    CV JOINT REPLACED 4 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASE.    HOOD LATCH ABOUT TO BREAK.  WHEN PULLING ON LEAVER, BARELY IS ABLE TO POP HOOD.  FEELS LIKE WIRE IS GOING TO SNAP.    WAITING FOR THE NEXT PROBLEM TO OCCUR - IT HAS BEEN NONSTOP.  GM DESIGNED A TERRIBLE VEHICLE.  I AM VERY DISSATISFIED AND I REGRET EVER BUYING IT.",
