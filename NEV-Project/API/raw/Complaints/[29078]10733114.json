I PULLED OVER AND CHECKED THOSE AND THEN THE WHEEL WELLS, AND THE BACK RIGHT WHEEL WELL WAS RUSTED SO BADLY THAT THE SHOCK MOUNT WAS NEARLY COMPLETELY DETACHED. IT DETACHED THE REST OF THE WAY OVER THE COURSE OF THE 2 MILE DRIVE TO MY HOME. THIS IS APPARENTLY A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS MAKE AND MODEL, ESPECIALLY IN THE 201-2004 RANGE, AND CAN AFFECT HANDLING. IT HAS BEEN REFERRED TO AS A FACTORY DEFECT AND A RECALL WAS ISSUED FOR THIS IN SOME VEHICLES, BUT NOT MINE. THE LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP WILL NOT LOOK AT IT BECAUSE ANY REPAIR WOULD REQUIRE ALTERATION TO THE BODY, SO THEY'VE REFERRED ME TO A BODY SHOP.",
