I WAS HIT HARD ENOUGH THAT THE CAR LOOKS ALMOST BENT IN HALF AND IT WAS DEEMED A TOTAL LOSS.   EVEN THOUGH I WAS HIT SO HARD, NO AIRBAGS DEPLOYED AT ALL.  THE DOOR WAS CRUSHED IN ON ME AND I WAS KNOCKED UNCONSCIOUS. I SUFFERED A CONCUSSION, BROKEN  COLLAR BONE, FRACTURED EYE SOCKED, CHEEK AND JAW. ALSO LACERATED CHEEK AND EYE LID. I ALSO NOW HAVE A DAMAGED LEFT EYE WITH BLURRED VISION AND PAIN AND NERVE DAMAGE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY FACE WHICH IS NOW NUMB. THE AIRBAGS SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED AND PREVENTED MY INJURIES. I AM AFRAID THAT SOME OF MY INJURIES ARE PERMANENT.  WHEN I WAS HIT I WAS IN MOTION TURNING LEFT ON A CITY STREET.",
