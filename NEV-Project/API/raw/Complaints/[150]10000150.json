WHEN THE DRIVER'S SEAT HEATER IS TURNED ON IT ACTIVATES THE STEERING WHEEL HEATER.  ON 12/13/02 IN USING THIS HEATER THE STEERING WHEEL BECAME HOT ENOUGH TO BURN MY HAND AND BEGAN TO FILL THE CAR WITH SMOKE.  IT MELTED THE FOAM UNDER THE LEATHER COVER.  IF I HAD NOT TURNED OFF THE SEAT/STEERING WHEEL HEATER I BELIEVE THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD HAVE CAUGHT FIRE.  MY INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOP INDICATES THERE IS A SHORT IN THE WHEEL THAT WILL REQUIRE REPLACEMENT.  I CHECKED AN ENTHUSIAST INTERNET SITE (AUDIWORLD.COM) AND DID A SEARCH OF SIMILAR PROBLEMS.  I FOUND SEVERAL OTHER AUDI MODELS HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS. TS",
