I HAVE BEEN TOLD THIS IS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE AND THAT ROTORS ARE A WEARABLE ITEM. I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS WILL BE A CONTINUAL PROBLEM WITH REPEAT TRIPS TO THE DEALERSHIP TO REPLACE WHAT APPEARS TO BE A DEFECTIVE PART AND IT'S CONTINUAL USE AS A REPLACEMENT PART. 90% OF MY DRIVING IS INTERSTATE DRIVING AND THE FEAR OF BRAKING IRREGULARITIES OR EFFECTIVENESS IS FRIGHTENING TO ME. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PREVENT THIS PROBLEM--NOT JUST COVER IT UP.",
