WE WERE ABOUT TO HAVE IT REPLACED WHEN OUR MECHANIC SUGGESTED THAT HE HAD SEEN A BUNCH OF HONDA CIVICS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM AND AS IT TURNED OUT, THE EXHAUSED MANIFOLD HAD CRACKED CAUSING THE O2 SENSOR TO GO.  WHEN OUR CIVIC WAS CHECK, THIS WAS EXACTLY THE CASE.  IT IS ~$1000 FOR PARTS ALONE.  WE BELIEVE HONDA KNOWS THIS PROBLEM EXSISTS AND WILL NOT RECALL DUE TO THE COST.",
