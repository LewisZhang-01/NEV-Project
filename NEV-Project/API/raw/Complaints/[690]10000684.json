I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT THEY RUSTED OUT FROM THE INSIDE AND THAT THIS WAS A COMMON RECURRING PROBLEM WITH CHEVROLET TRUCK BRAKE ROTORS.  OF COURSE, IT WAS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY.  I DO NOT THINK ROTORS SHOULD RUST OUT AFTER SUCH A SHORT TIME PERIOD AND WITH SUCH LOW MILEAGE.  IS THERE ANY RECOURSE?",
