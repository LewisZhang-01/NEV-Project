        "summary": "WE OWN A 1998 FORD WINDSTAR.  WHEN THE CAR WAS LESS THAN A YEAR OLD WE TOOK IT IN TO HAVE A FRAYED SEAT BELT REPAIRED.  I HAVE THE PAPERWORK FOR THIS REPAIR.  WE THEN HAD A BABY AND INSTALLED A FIVE POINT HARNESS CAR SEAT IN THAT SEAT POSITION.  THE CAR SEAT REMAINED THERE FOR FOUR YEARS, (REMOVED ONLY WHEN SO FILTHY IT HAD TO BE CLEANED), THUS THE SEAT BELT REMAINED LOCKED IN POSITION AND WAS NOT PULLED OUT OR RETRACTED DURING THAT TIME. THAT BABY IS NOW OLD ENOUGH TO NEED A BOOSTER SEAT (WHICH UTILIZES THE SEAT BELT DIRECTLY).  WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF STARTING TO USE THE BOOSTER SEAT DAILY WE NOTICED THAT THE SEAT BELT WAS ONCE AGAIN FRAYING.  I CALLED THE DEALER AND HE TOLD ME TO BRING IT IN. WE TOOK IT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL REPAIR PLACE (WITH THE PAPERWORK FROM THE FIRST REPAIR) AND EXPLAINED THE SITUATION.  THEY TOLD US THAT SINCE THE FIRST REPAIR WAS AT 7138 MILES AND THE VAN NOW HAS 89,123 MILES ON IT THAT THE SEAT BELT WAS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY.   *NLM",
