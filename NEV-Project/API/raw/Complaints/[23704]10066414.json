        "summary": "I BOUGHT BMW 325XI 2004 ON 03/04 AND I NOTICED THAT IT HAS PROBLEM WITH COLD START. IN THE MORNING, WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN \"D\", IT DOESN'T MOVE AND THEN SUDDENLY LURCHES WITH A JERK. FIRST I THOUGHT, ITS JUST BECAUSE ITS A NEW CAR BUT WHEN I DIDN'T DRIVE IT FOR 3 DAYS AND STARTED IT, IT WAS WORSE. IT WOULDN'T MOVE AT ALL FOR LIKE A MINUTE  AND THEN SUDDENLY LURCHED FORWARD WITH A JERK ALMOST HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME THAT ALL 3 SERIES MANUFACTURED BETWEEN 03-03 TO 11-03 HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND IT IS DUE TO THE TRANSMISSION . WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS IF THERE IS A RECALL ON THAT. THEY DIDN'T TELL ME ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AT ALL WHEREAS NOW I READ THE MESSAGE BOARDS AND THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS. I WONDER WHAT MY OPTIONS ARE? I BOUGHT THE CAR BECAUSE THERE WAS A SPECIAL DEAL ON THIS CAR. MAY BE THE DEAL WAS BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.  *JB",
