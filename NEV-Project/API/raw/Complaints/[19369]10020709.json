        "summary": "WE HAVE OWNED OUR 99' WINDSTAR SINCE THE DAY IT WAS NEW, AND AT FIRST LOVED IT. BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION AND AS I HAVE FOUND OUT WITH FORD EMPLOYED INVESTIGATORS THE 99' WAS A BAD YEAR FOR MANY AREAS TO INCLUDE THE TRANSMISSION. OUR TRANSMISSION GOES INTO DEFAULT LIMP-HOME MODE(OVERDRIVE FLASHES ON AND OFF CONTINUOUSLY RPM'S INCREASE AND SHIFTS HARD). AT 5 MILES AFTER STARTING UP AND GETTING UNDER WAY. THE DEALER TOLD ME THE BEST REPAIR TO THE PROBLEM WAS TO \"DRIVE THE VAN TILL THE TRANS DIES\" AS THIS WAS AN EASIER FIX THAN THE BAD COMPUTER MODULE. SUPPOSEDLY CHEAPER AS WELL. I STRONGLY URGE EVERYONE IN THE WINDSTAR TRANSMISSION PREDICKAMENT TO SPREAD THE NEWS AS FORD SHOULD CORRECT THIS KNOWN PROBLEM BEFOR IT KILLS SOMEONE.",
