        "summary": "2008 PRIUS, 2006 LEXUS 400H MOMENTARY BRAKE LOSS.  I BELIEVE THE 2010 PRIUS BRAKE ISSUE GOES WELL BEYOND 2010 PRIUS MODELS.  I THINK THE MOMENTARY (SPLIT SECOND) DELAY IN BRAKING HAPPENS AT LOW SPEEDS, INFREQUENTLY, PERHAPS IN THE B SHIFT POSITION EXCLUSIVELY (NOT CERTAIN ON THIS IN THE LEXUS) AND USUALLY ON SLIPPERY SURFACES AND/OR COLD WEATHER AND USUALLY WHEN GOING DOWN AN INCLINE.  THE FEELING I GOT IN MY PRIUS AND MY WIFE IN HER LEXUS WAS NOT AN ACCELERATION FEELING BUT A GOING INTO NEUTRAL FEELING.  IT KIND OF FELT LIKE THE CAR PICKED UP SPEED BUT MORE FROM THE COASTING EFFECT THAN ANYTHING TO DUE WITH AN ACCELERATOR.  I WOULD LOOK AT THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKING AS IT RELATES TO REGENERATIVE BRAKING WITH A DASH OF SPEED THROWN IN.  GOOD LUCK.  I STILL FEEL THE CARS ARE SAFE.  DATE BELOW NOT REAL-JUST PLACEHOLDER -TODAY'S DATE. *TR",
