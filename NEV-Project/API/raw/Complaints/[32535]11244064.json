LOSS OF POWER, WRENCH LIGHT  CAME ON. PULLED OVER, LOUD/HARD CLANK SOUND WITH EVERY GEAR CHANGE P-2. VEHICLE HAD DISPLAYED NO ISSUES PRIOR TO THIS. I AM ABLE TO PULL THE CAR OVER, TURN IT OFF AND TAKE THEY KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION. THEN THE WRENCH LIGHT IS OFF WHEN I RESTART THE CAR.  STAYS IN LOW GEAR FOR A LONG TIME WHEN I START TO ACCELERATE, AND UNTIL VEHICLE EVENTUALLY ACCELERATES FASTER, OTHER CARS ALMOST RUNNING INTO THE BACK OF MY CAR SINCE MY CAR IS NOT ACCELERATING AT A NORMAL PACE.    I AM GREATLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT APPEARS TO BE A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE WITH THIS CAR. THERE ARE MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE TO BE FOUND ALL OVER THE INTERNET. FORD NEEDS TO ISSUE A RECALL AND FIX THIS ASAP BEFORE SOMEONE GETS SERIOUSLY HURT OR IS KILLED FROM THE EXTREME LOSS OF POWER THE VEHICLE IS SUFFERING FROM WHEN THIS OCCURS!",
