WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE A TWO YEAR THAT IS OVER 40 POUNDS THAT HAS TO TRAVEL FOR 12-14 HOURS. TS    FIRST OF ALL, HE NO LONGER FITS INTO THE FIVE POINT HARNESS.     SECONDLY, BOOSTER SEATS HAVE NO PADDING. I WOULD NOT WANT TO SEAT IN ONE OF THOSE SEATS FOR 12-14 HOURS, SO WHY SHOULD I PUT MY CHILD THRU SUCH PAIN. YES, I AM WORRIED ABOUT MY CHILDS SAFTEY. DO YOU KNOW HOW DISTRACTING IT IS TO DRIVE WITH A SCREAMING CHILD BECAUSE HE IS SO MISERABLE?     THIRDLY, HAS ANY ONE DONE ANY STUDIES ON THE EFFECT OF THE CHILDS NECK MUSCLES AS A RESULT OF THE WAY HE HAS TO SLEEP IN A BOOSTER SEAT WITH HIS HEAD HANGING DOWN. YES I HAVE BOUGHT HIM A NECK PILLOW. NO THIS DOES NOT HELP. MY SON HAD PROBLEMS WITH A TIGHT MUSCLE IN HIS NECK FROM BIRTH. I HAD TO GET THERAPY. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE IS THE CARSEAT CAUSES THIS CONDITION TO RETURN???? YES, I WOULD LIKE SOMEONE TO RESPOND BY MAIL TO THIS QUESTION!!! AFTERALL, ISN'T YOUR ORGANIZATION CONCERNED ABOUT SAFTEY? AND IF MY SON'S STIFF MUSCLE RETURNS, CAUSING HIS HEAD TO GROW ABNORMALLY WHICH CAN CAUSE OTHER THINGS LIKE BRAIN DAMAGE, WOULDN'T YOU CALL THIS A SAFTEY ISSUE?????????    MAYBE YOUR ORGANIZATION HASN'T LOOKED AT ALL THE SAFETY ISSUES INVOLVE IN CARSEATS!!",
