        "summary": "WE HAVE A TOYOTA SEQUOIA, THE PROBLEMS ARE THE 4 WHEEL DRIVE IS NOT OPERATING ALL THE TIME. IT DOES NOT ENGAGE, WHEN IT DOES SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT STAY IN 4 WHEEL DRIVE. ONE EXAMPLE IS WHEN MY WIFE HAD SIX FRIENDS IN THE VEHICLE THE 4 WHEEL DRIVE DID NOT STAY ENGAGED AND THE VEHICLE SKID CONTROL MADE THE ENGINE LOOSE POWER SO SHE SLID BACKWARDS DOWN A HILL. NO ONE WOULD RIDE IN OUR 4 WHEEL DRIVE AGAIN. THE VEHICLE SKID CONTROL ACTIVATES AT RADOM ON DRY PAVEMENT. THE SKID CONTROL MAKES THE ENGINE LOOSE POWER WHILE IN TRAFFIC. THERE IS ALSO A HESITATION IN THE ENGINE WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A COMPLETE STOP. ANOTHER PROBLEM IS THE BRAKING SYSTEM IS ANOT ADEQUATE FOR THE VEHICLE. THE ENTIRE FRONT BRAKES HAD TO BE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN IN FOR THE SAME REAIRS AT LEAST FIVE TIMES AND IS STILL NOT WORKING THE WAY IT SHOULD. WE HAVE ALL THE DOCUMENTATION FOR SERVICE ON OUR SEQUOIA. WE HAVE DONE INTERNET RESEARCH THROUGH THE NHTSA AND HAVE FOUND THE SAME PROBLEM WITH OTHER TOYOTA SEQUOIA'S.",
