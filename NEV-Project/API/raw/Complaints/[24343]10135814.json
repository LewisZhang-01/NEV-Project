I SUFFERED A FEW BUMPS AND BRUISES BUT NEVER WENT TO THE DOCTOR. IF THE ACCIDENT WERE WORSE THAN WHAT IT WAS AND THE AIR BAGS MALFUNCTIONED, I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. I WENT TO FORD AND NOTHING WAS EVER DONE ABOUT IT. IT WAS NEVER LOOKED INTO TO SEE IF THEY DID INFACT MALFUNCTION. I LOOKED UP THE RECALLS AND THERE WAS ONE TO THE WHEEL AND SOMETHING ELSE AND I WANT TO SEE IF THAT RECALL WERE FIXED.  *JB",
