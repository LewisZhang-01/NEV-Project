THE DEALER TELLS ME IT IS THE THROTTLE BODY AND THAT THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEM.  THEY ALSO TELL ME IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN.  FORD MOTOR REFUSES TO FIX THE PROBLEM UNDER WARRANTY UNTIL THE DEALER CAN REPRODUCE THIS INTERMITTENT PROBLEM OR ITS COMPUTER SYSTEMS CONFIRMS A PROBLEM.  NEITHER COULD BE DONE WHEN I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR.  THE INTERNET DEMONSTRATES OTHERS WITH THIS EXACT SAME PROBLEM.  I AM WORRIED THAT THIS PROBLEM WILL REOCCUR IN AN INOPPORTUNE TIME CAUSING AN ACCIDENT AND INJURY.  WHEN IT OCCURS, THE ACCELERATOR STOPS WORKING, BUT THE ENGINE IS STILL RUNNING.  A WRENCH LIGHT APPEARS ON THE DASH.  I AM ABLE TO COAST TO A STOP, BUT MUST PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND RESTART THE CAR FOR THE PROBLEM TO TEMPORARILY RESOLVE.  FORD SEEMS TO BE AWARE THAT THIS PROBLEM EXISTS, BUT IS REFUSING TO MAKE THE WARRANTY REPAIR.  *TR",
