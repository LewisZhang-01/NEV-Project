NOW AT 22,000 THE FRONT ROTORS ARE WARPED AGAIN AND ARE TOO THIN TO MACHINE AGAIN.  THEY HAVE TO BE REPLACED.  WE FEEL THESE ARE DEFECTED FROM THE MANUFACTURER BECAUSE OF THE ALLOY USED IN THESE ROTORS BEING POOR QUALITY.  IF A DEALERSHIP HAS 40 ROTORS SETS IN STOCK, THERE MUST BE A HEAVY DEMAND FOR THESE.  I AM IN PROCESS OF WORKING W/ HYUNDAI ON THIS ISSUE.  THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN.*AK",
