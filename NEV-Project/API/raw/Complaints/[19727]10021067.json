I GOT HER IN THE EXPLORER, TURNED THE KEY ON AND THE DRIVER SIDE AIR BAG EXPLODED, I NEVER EVEN GOT TO PUT THE CAR IN GEAR OR ANYTHING.  .MY HUSBAND (GORDON SHERNAN) TALKED WITH FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND BECAUSE OF THE VEHICLE BEING OVER WARRANTY, THEY WEREN'T THE LEAST BIT CONCERNED.  I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO KNOW WHY ONE WENT OFF AND NOT THE OTHER, AND WHY IT WENT OFF BY JUST STARTING THE VEHICLE.  I FEEL THIS IS REALLY A SAFETY ISSUE,NOT ONLY DID IT SCARE HALF THE LIFE OUT OF BOTH OF US, BUT MAKES YOU WORRY EVERY TIME YOU GET IN A CAR WITH AIR BAGS.  IF I HAD BEEN DRIVING ON A ROAD WAY, I CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE HAD AN ACCIDENT.  I FIND IT VERY LAX ON FORD MOTOR COMPANY PART THAT THEY ARE NOT CONCERNED AT ALL.  FORTUNATELY I WALKED AWAY WITH JUST A SORE CHEST, SHOULDER AND STIFF NECK.*AK",
