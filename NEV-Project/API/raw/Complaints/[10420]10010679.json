CONSUMER REPORT HAS REFUSED TO RATE THIS MODEL IN THE BOOSTER MODE BECAUSE THEY FIND IT DOES NOT RESTRAIN A CHILD.  THE BELT POSITIONING CLIP DOES NOT LET THE BELT RETRACT WHEN THE CHILD LEANS FOWARD.   I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED AS THE CAR SEAT DOES NOT PERFORM ITS VITAL FUNCTION.  I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT SINCE IT HAS ONLY BEEN ON THE MARKET FOR A FEW YEARS, MANY OF THE CONSUMERS, LIKE MYSELF, PURCHASED IT TO BE USED FOR THEIR INFANT AND HAVE YET TO BE AT THE BOOSTER STAGE.  PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS MATTER.  *JB",
