        "summary": "HEADLIGHTS ON MANY VEHICLES ARE MOUNTED AT A LEVEL EQUAL TO THE EYE LEVEL OF A PERSON DRIVING A STANDARD PASSENGER VEHICLE, THEREBY CAUSING SUBSTANTIAL GLARE, REDUCING ABILITY OF THE PASSENGER VEHICLE DRIVER TO SEE BEYOND THE ONCOMING VEHICLE WITH THE HIGH-MOUNTED HEADLIGHTS.  THE GLARE IS EQUALLY DISTRACTING WHEN THE VEHICLE WITH THE HIGH-MOUNTED LIGHTS IS AT THE REAR OF A STANDARD PASSENGER VEHICLE.  I IMPLORE CONGRESS TO PASS LEGISLATION RESTRICTING THE HEIGHT OF HEADLIGHTS, OR OTHER LIGHTS PROJECTING A BEAM TO THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE, TO BE LOWER THAN EYE LEVEL OF DRIVERS IN STANDARD PASSENGER TYPE VEHICLES.  SUCH A RESTRICTION WILL ALSO AID DRIVERS OF THE TRUCKS AND SUV'S THAT HAVE THE HIGH-MOUNTED LIGHTS BECAUSE IN FOG OR SNOW CONDITIONS THE HIGH-MOUNTED LIGHTS REFLECT GLARE BACK INTO THE SIGHT OF THE DRIVER.  *JB",
