        "summary": "THE DRIVER SIDE SEAT AND SIDE CURTAIN AIRBAGS DEPLOYED ON MY 2002 VOLKSWAGEN GTI 337 EDITION FOR NO READILY APPARENT REASON.  THIS LEFT ME WITH A RINGING EAR, SORE SHOULDER, AND IN A VERY SHAKEN STATE.  THE DEALERSHIP THAT I TOOK THE CAR TO FOR FACTORY REPAIR AT FIRST AGREED THAT THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO INDICATE ANY SORT OF ACCIDENT.  TWO DAYS LATER A FACTORY ENGINEER (APPARENTLY FROM VWOA) EXAMINED THE CAR AND FOUND A NICK IN A METAL BEAM.  THIS NICK (SMALLER THAN A DIME) IS APPARENTLY WHAT CAUSED THE AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS STATED THAT MY INSURANCE WOULD HAVE TO COVER THE REPAIRS AS THEY ARE NOT UNDER WARRANTY BECAUSE OF THIS NICK.    I'M CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF FILING A CLAIM THROUGH THE BBB AUTO LINE.  THEY HAVE A PROCESS THROUGH MEDIATION AND ARBITRATION THAT WILL HOPEFULLY RESOLVE MY SITUATION WITHOUT HAVING TO RESORT TO A LAWSUIT.  I STRONGLY FEEL THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE TAKEN CARE OF THE REPAIR WITHOUT QUESTION, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE DANGEROUS NATURE OF AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT.   *NLM",
