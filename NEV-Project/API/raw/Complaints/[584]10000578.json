THE PROBLEM IS WIDESPREAD WITH THIS VECHICLE (AUDI A4) AND IS HAPPENING TO MANY OWNERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE MANUFACTURER, AUDI, IS AWARE OF THE DEFECT AND THE FACT THAT FAILURES ARE OCCURRING IN A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF ITS CARS, BUT HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL.  INSTEAD IT IS REPLACING THE DEFECTIVE PART ONLY AFTER IT FAILS.  MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT IS NOT REPLACING THE OTHER DEFECTIVE COIL PACKS IN THE CARS THAT HAVE NOT YET FAILED, THEREBY LEAVING THEM VULNERABLE TO FUTURE FAILURES.  THE CARS SHOULD BE RECALLED SO THAT ALL COIL PACKS ARE REPALCED.  THIS IS A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE.",
