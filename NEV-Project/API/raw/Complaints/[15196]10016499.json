MY FRONT PASSENGER SEAT BELT DOES NOT FULLY RETRACT TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY TENSION TO PROTECT THE SEATED PASSENGER IN THE EVENT OF A COLLISION. FORTUNATELY FOR ME, THERE HAD BEEN NO ACCIDENTS SO FAR.  THIS HAD BEEN A SAFETY ISSUE SINCE THE INCIDENT DATE. I DID NOT REPORT THIS COMPLAINT BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW THIS WONDERFUL WEB-SITE EXISTED AT THE TIME.               *JB",
