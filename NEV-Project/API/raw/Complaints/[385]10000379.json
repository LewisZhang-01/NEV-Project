        "summary": "MY DODGE PICKUP HAS BEEN INTO THE DEALER MANY TIMES TO TRY TO FIX A REPETITIVE PROBLEM WITH MY FRONT DRIVER SIDE BRAKES. ONE PAD OUT OF THE FOUR UP FRONT WEAR DOWN TO NOTHING WHILE THE OTHER 3 HAVE PRACTICALLY NO WEAR. THE DEALERSHIP HAS CHANGED THE CALIPER, ROTOR, PADS, EVERYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE FRONT DISC BRAKES TO NO AVAIL. THE SAME FRONT DRIVER SIDE WHEEL AREA HAS HAD THE IDLER ARM REPLACED AND OTHER PARTS TO TRY TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM, BUT NOTHING HAS WORKED. THE DEALERSHIP NOW HAS RUN OUT OF PARTS TO CHANGE TO TRY TO FIX, SO THEY HAVE PRETTY MUCH GAVE UP AND SAY THAT I HAVE TO PAY FOR ANOTHER BRAKE JOB. THE SINGLE PAD WEARS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE RIVETS WITHIN 12-15K MILES, SO THE DEALER TELLS ME THAT I WILL NEED A BRAKE JOB EVERY 12-15K MILES. RIDICULOUS. THEY HAVE ACCEPTED ALL THE OTHER PRIOR ATTEMPTS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM UNDER THE VEHICLE WARRANTY, BUT NOW THEY WILL NOT, AS THEY HAVE RUN OUT OF IDEAS TO FIX IT. THE VEHICLE IS STILL WITHIN ITS WARRANTY PERIOD. THEY HAVE NO EXPLANATION TO GIVE ME FOR THIS FAILURE EITHER.",
