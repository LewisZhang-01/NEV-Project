LEFT SIDE HASN'T WORKED RIGHT SINCE WE GOT THE CAR AND NOW DON'T WORK AT ALL. OUR GRANDSON LIVES WITH US, HE IS FOUR YEARS OLD AND IT IS THE LAW THAT HE IS TO BE IN A CAR SEAT AND RESTRAINED. THE CAR IS ONLY USED SIX MONTHS OUT OF THE YEAR, HASN'T BEEN ABUSED. I FEEL THAT DEALER OR MANUFACTURER SHOULD REPLACE, SINCE WE HAVEN'T HAD THE CAR VERY LONG AND IS A SAFETY ITEM.   *AK     *PH  *NLM    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**765493",
