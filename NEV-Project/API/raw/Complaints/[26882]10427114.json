I HAVE REPEATEDLY BEEN OPERATING IN TRAFFIC WHEN THE VEHICLE'S ACCELERATION PAUSES, THE RPM SHOOTS WAY UP, THE DROPS DOWN AFTER A FEW SECONDS, AND THEN THE TRANSMISSION RE-ENGAGES IN A JERKING FASHION.  THIS IS A CONSIDERABLE PROBLEM GIVEN MY OPERATION IN AND AROUND A MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREA WITH SIGNIFICANT TRAFFIC.  SUDDEN UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN VELOCITY, AND FAILURE TO MAINTAIN VELOCITY, IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.  *TR",
