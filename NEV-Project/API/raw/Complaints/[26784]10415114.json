THE DEALER REPLACED A WHEEL-SPEED SENSOR AND STATED THAT THE SENSOR WAS DAMAGED WHEN THE \"TONE\" WHEEL CRACKED. DEALER ALSO STATED THAT UNLESS THE TONE WHEEL WAS REPLACED, THE ABS WAS NOT OPERATIONAL. SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN; IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE ABS, BUT DON'T THE DRIVER IS SET UP FOR THE BIG FALL! FORD IS AWARE OF THIS CRACKING PROBLEM: WHY NO RECALL?  *TR",
