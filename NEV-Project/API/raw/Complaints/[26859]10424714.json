I TOOK THE CAR TO THE FORD DEALER TO FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM MAY BE; CAUSE I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS A BROKEN MOTOR MOUNT. I WAS TOLD THAT IT MAY BE IN THE MOTOR. I'M ALSO HAVING AN ISSUE WITH THE REAR PASSENGER DOOR SOUNDING LIKE WATER BUILD UP INSIDE THE DOOR. I CHECK THE WEB TO FIND OUT IF FORD HAD A RECALL ON THESE ISSUES TO FIND THAT OTHER OWNERS ARE HAVING SIMILAR ISSUES.  *TR",
