I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE SEAT BELT MECHANISM ON THE 2ND ROW OF SEATS ON THE FAR LEFT SIDE. THE BELTS WILL INTERMITTENTLY LOCK UP TRAPPING THE PASSENGER SUDDENLY. THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO UNBUCKLE THEM AND RESET THEM. THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED ONCE BEFORE AND AFTER MUCH ARGUMENT THE DEALERSHIP RELUCTANTLY REPLACED THE MECHANISM. NOW I AM HAVING THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM AND SINCE I CANNOT DEMONSTRATE THE PROBLEM ON COMMAND, THE DEALERSHIP REFUSES TO REPLACE THE FAULTY MECHANISM.  *JB",
