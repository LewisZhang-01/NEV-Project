        "summary": "RECENTLY PURCHASED A BRAND NEW 2012 MAZDA SPEED3.  17 MILES OFF THE LOT.  IN THE 4 MILE DRIVE TO MY HOUSE 15 MINUTES AFTER SIGNING PAPERWORK, THE CLUTCH BLOWS OUT.  HAD IT TOWED BACK AND WAS TOLD WE WERE LUCKY THEY FIXED IT UNDER WARRANTY BECAUSE THIS ITEM IS A \"WEAR & TEAR\" ITEM BECAUSE GOING 4 MILES IS APPARENTLY TOO LONG.  WE WERE TOLD TO \"BREAK THE CLUTCH IN\" FOR ABOUT 400 MILES.  WELL, WE MADE IT TO 125 MILES ON THE ODOMETER AND THE SAME EXACT THING HAPPENED.  EXCEPT THIS TIME, I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 40MPH ON A BUSY ROAD WHEN THE CLUTCH WENT OUT.  LUCKILY MY THREE YOUNG CHILDREN WERE NOT IN THE CAR.  THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY IN OWNING A VEHICLE FOR A MERE 2.5 DAYS IN OUR HANDS WE HAVE BLOWN TWO CLUTCHES OR THE VEHICLE HAVE ANY WEAR OR TEAR.  NOW THEY WANT OUR MONEY TO FIX A CAR I HAVE HAD FOR 2.5 DAYS.  THIS IS A LOAD OF CRAP ON MAZDAS PART AND THEY NEED TO FIX THIS NOT ONLY ON MY VEHICLE BUT WHATEVER OTHER ONES ARE OUT THERE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. *TR",
