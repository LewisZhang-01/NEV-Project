        "summary": "MY DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY (55 MPH LIMIT) AND SLOWED DOWN TO APPROX. 10 MPH DUE TO A TRAFFIC JAM WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE EPS LIGHT CAME ON AND SHE LOST HER STEERING.  AT THAT SPEED, IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO STEER.  SHE MANAGED TO PULL THE CAR OVER TO THE SHOULDER AND CALLED ME FOR HELP.  I RESEARCHED HER SITUATION AND LEARNED THAT THERE IS A RECALL FOR ALL 2008 ELANTRAS AND LATER TO FIX THE EPS.  THE DATE OF MANUFACTURE HAD TO BE AFTER 1 JUNE 2008.  UNFORTUNATELY, HER CAR WAS BUILT IN AUG 2007.  THAT BEING SAID, PERHAPS THE CURRENT EPS RECALL SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE 2008 MODELS MANUFACTURED BEFORE JUNE 2008?  I CALLED FOR A TOW TRUCK AS IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS (AND PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE) FOR HER TO DRIVE ANY FURTHER.  WHILE WAITING FOR THE TOW, I RESEARCHED THE EPS SITUATION ONLINE AND LEARNED FROM A BLOG THAT TURNING OFF THE ENGINE AND RESTARTING IT SOMETIMES RESETS THE EPS.  SHE DID SO AND IT \"FIXED\" HER STEERING.  I'M CERTAIN THIS IS A TEMPORARY FIX ONLY AND WILL NOT PREVENT A FUTURE REOCCURRENCE OF THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION.",
