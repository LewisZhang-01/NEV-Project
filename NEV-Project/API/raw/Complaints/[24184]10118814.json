THE MECHANIC SAID IT WAS A COMPUTER COMPONENT THAT CONTROLLED THE REAR BRAKING SYSTEM AND THAT IT WAS COMMON FOR THE INTRIGUE. I THEN WENT TO MY MECHANIC WHO MAINTAINS MY VEHICLE ON A REGULAR BASIS AND HE RAN A COMPUTER DIAGNOSTIC ON MY CAR AND ALSO SAID IT WAS THE COMPUTER AND THE MOTOR THAT OPERATES THE REAR BRAKES. THIS PROBLEM IS NOT A NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR PROBLEM FOR CARS AND HAS ENDANGERED ME AND ALSOIS VERY COSTLY. BOTH MECHANICS ESTAMATE TO REPALCE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WOULD RUN ABOUT $1700 AND THERE IS NO WAY AROUND IT. I AM CUURENTLY USING ONLY MY FRONT BRAKES AND IF I WOULD HAVE NOT KNOWN TO GET THEM CHECKED SHORLY AFTER REPLACING BOTH MY FRONT ROTORS AND PADS THE PROBLEM WOULD STILL HAVE GONE UNDETECTED",
