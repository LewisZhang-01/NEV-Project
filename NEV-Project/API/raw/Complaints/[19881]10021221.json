        "summary": "MAZDA 626 TRANSMISSION BROKE AFTER JUST 50000 MILES: WE WERE DRIVING FROM NY TO PITTSBURGH ON OUR WAY HOME AND THE O/D LIGHT STARTED FLASHING. AFTER PULLING THE CAR TO THE NEXT EXIT BURNING SMELL STARTED COMING IN SO WE TOOK THE CAR TO PEP BOYS WHO CHANGED THE TRANSMISSION FLUID BUT IT STILL DIDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM OF CAR UNABLE TO MOVE/SLIP GEARS WHEN OCCASIONALLY IT MOVED. TOOK THE CAR TO AAMCO  WHO REPLACED THE WHOLE TRANSMISSION AND THE TOTAL COST CAME TO SOMEWHERE LIKE $4000. ON DOING FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET FOUND OUT THAT MAZDA WAS PUTTING FORD TRANSMISSIONS IN SOME OF THERE VEHICLES AND FORD HAD ISSUE WITH THE TRANSMISSIONS FOR THERE OWN VEHICLES AT ONE POINT. HERE IS THE LINK FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAD ISSUES WITH THERE TRANSMISSION FOR MAZDA CARS. I WAS JUST WONDERING WITH SO MANY PEOPLE HAVING ISSUES AND MANY MORE WHO HAVEN'T EVEN REGISTERED OR FILED COMPLAINT, HOW COME AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT YET RECALLED THIS CAR OR ORDERED MAZDA TO FIX THIS ISSUE AT THERE OWN COST. I HAVE TRIED TO TALK TO MAZDA DIRECTLY AND IT HAS JUST BEEN WASTE OF TIME FOR ME. HOPEFULLY THERE WOULD BE SOME ACTION TAKEN SOON FOR THIS TRANSMISSION ISSUE.    *JB    HTTP://WWW.CARTRACKERS.COM/FORUMS/LIVE/YOURLEMON/189.HTML",
