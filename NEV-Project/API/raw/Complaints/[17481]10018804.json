MY MECHANIC SAYS THAT HE HAS SEEN A LOT OF PROBLEMS LIKE WITH REAR SUSPENSION IN THESE CARS.  I DRIVE AN ESCORT WAGON.  I DON'T GO OFF ROADING SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE REAR SPRINGS ARE BROKEN.  SEEMS LIKE THIS COULD BE AN ISSUE OF A FAULTY PART OR SUSPENSION SYSTEM.  WHEN I HAVE PEOPLE IN THE BACK SEAT OF MY CAR THE HANDLING IS AWFUL AND I HAVE TO GO REALLY SLOW OVER ANY SORT OF BUMP BECAUSE THE CAR WILL BOTTOM OUT!  JUST THOUGHT OTHERS MAY BE EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM.  *NLM",
