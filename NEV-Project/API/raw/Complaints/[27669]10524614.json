FIRST TIME I PULLED OFF SIDE OF THE ROAD TO AVOID BEING REAR ENDED BY A TRUCK. THE SECOND TIME SLOWING FOR A STOP SIGN. SAME ON THE THIRD , FOURTH AND FIFTH. BY THE TIME I MADE IT HOME I WAS A NERVOUS WRECK. THIS IS RIDICULOUS THE BIKE ONLY HAS 27 MILES ON IT. I'M REALLY TICKED OFF AND THIS IS NOT SAFE THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL.  *TR",
