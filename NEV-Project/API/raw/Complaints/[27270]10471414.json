I NOTICED LATELY THAT THE BATTERY LIGHT GOES ON AS WELL BUT THEN GOES OFF AFTER I REGAIN CONTROL OF THE STEERING WHEEL.  I AM SOOOO SCARED TO DRIVE THIS CAR AND DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  I CANNOT REPLICATE THIS ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT HAS TO BE RAINING FOR IT TO HAPPEN AND AT THE SAME TIME ITS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE UNDER WET CONDITIONS!  HELP!!  *TR",
