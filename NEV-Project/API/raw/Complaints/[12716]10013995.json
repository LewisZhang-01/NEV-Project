THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION SHIFT LEVER LOCKING FEATURE HAS FAILED TO THE POINT THE LEVER CAN BE INADVERTENTLY MOVED TO ANY POSITION WHEN EVER THE IGNITION SWITCH IS ON.  NORMALLY YOU NEED TO PULL THE LEVER TOWARD YOU TO SHIFT OUT OF PARK OR INTO REVERSE FROM DRIVE OR NEUTRAL.  PERSONS IN THE CAR CAN NOW INADVERTENTLY BRUSH THE LEVER AND SHIFT INTO AND OUT OF GEAR.  NO ACTUAL INCIDENT OCCURRED, BUT THE DEALER SAID THEY SEE QUITE OF FEW OF THESE FAILED THIS WAY.  I CONSIDER THIS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT THE MANUFACTURE SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER FOR A RECALL. *JB",
