I HAVE BEEN   HAVING \"STARTING ISSUES\" WITH IT; OVER THE PAST YEAR IT HAS HAD THE   IACV REPLACED TWICE, THE FUEL PUMP, THE STARTER AND THE FUEL FILTER ALL REPLACED ONCE.  THE FUEL FILTER WAS REPLACED WITH IN THE LAST 3   MONTHS.  THE CAR EITHER WILL ACT LIKE IT DOES NOT WANT TO START   (SPUTTER STARTING), OR IT WILL DIE RIGHT AFTER PUTTING IT INTO DRIVE.    IT HAPPENS MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN USING THE E85 GASOLINE, BUT ALSO DOES IT WITH REGULAR GAS.  FORD BASICALLY HAS TOLD ME THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ANY STARTING OR STALLING PROBLEMS RELATED TO ETHANOL FUEL AND HAVE GIVEN UP ON FIXING MY PROBLEM.  *JB",
