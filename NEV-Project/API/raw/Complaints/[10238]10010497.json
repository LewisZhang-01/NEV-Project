        "summary": "THE ELECTRICAL INSULATION OF THE MAIN WIRING HARNESS HAS VIRTUALLY DISINTEGRATED, APPARENTLY FROM THE (NORMAL) HEAT OF THE ENGINE.  THE INSULATION LITERALLY FLAKES AWAY IN MY HAND WHEN BEING HANDLED EVEN WITH THE MOST GENTLE TOUCH.  THE MANUFACTURER (MERCEDES) CLAIMS THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM DESPITE THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.  THE COST TO REPLACE THE WIRING HARNESS IS $500+ FOR ONLY THE PART;  THE COST OF INSTALLATION IS ALSO IN EXCESS OF $500, THUS COSTING OVER $1,000.    THIS IS A CRITICAL SAFETY ISSUE!  THE DETERIORATED INSULATION CAUSES INTERMITTENT ELECTRICAL SHORT-CIRCUITS, CAUSING MY CAR TO SUDDENLY LOSE ENGINE POWER WITHOUT WARNING.  JUST AS SUDDENLY, THE CAR REGAINS POWER AND LURCHES AHEAD, THEN LOSES POWER, LURCHES AHEAD, ETC.   THE CYCLE OF LURCHING/LOSING POWER HAPPENS IN RAPID SUCCESSION -- FOUR OR FIVE TIMES INSIDE OF A MINUTE -- MAKING THE VEHICLE DIFFICULT TO \"CONTROL.\"   ALL OF THIS ON THE 405N FREEWAY IN LOS ANGELES ON THE CUSP OF RUSH-HOUR.   *NLM",
