        "summary": "I HAVE AN 07 JEEP COMPASS. I HAVE OWNED IT FOR 5 YEARS AND I HAVE A MAJOR SAFTEY ISSUES. GAS LIGHT CAME ON SO I FILLED UP. GOT A FEW YARDS FROM THE PUMP AND IT STALLED. NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT OR ANYTHING CAME ON. WAS ABLE TO PULL INTO A PARKING SPOT. EVERY TIME I TURN THE CAR ON IT SPUTTERS A BIT THEN RUNS. AFTER ABOUT A MINUTE OR TWO OF IDLING IT STALLS. TRIED LETTING IT IDLE AND REVVING THE ENGINE. MY CAR STOPPED IN EVERYWHERE IN ROADS, HIGHWAYS, AND THANKS GOD I DIDN'T GET INTO ANY ACCIDENT. I SEARCHED ONLINE AND IT TURNED OUT THAT MANY JEEP/CHRYSLER OWNERS HAVE THIS ISSUE AND THERE WAS A RECALL FOR JEEP COMPASS 2011/2012 FOR THIS ISSUE BUT OTHER MODELS.  (HTTPS://STATIC.NHTSA.GOV/ODI/RCL/2013/RCONL-13V120-0123.PDF). PLEASE CHECK THIS THREAD FOR PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE (HTTPS://WWW.CARGURUS.COM/CARS/DISCUSSION-T29898_DS631498). I HOPE THAT YOU SOLVE THIS ISSUE THAT PROBABLY THOUSANDS OF CARS IS HAVING. THANK YOU.",
