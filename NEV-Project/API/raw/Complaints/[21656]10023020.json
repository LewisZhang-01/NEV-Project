MY CAR SOUNDED LIKE A DIESEL ENGINE AS IF SOMETHING HAD BROKE WITHIN THE ENGINE, THIS ALL HAPPEN ON MARCH 5TH, 2003 I SUPPLIED DOCUMENTATION TO SHOW THAT MY OIL WAS CHANGED AS REQUIRED BUT TO KNOW AVAIL WOULD THE WARRANTY COMPANY ASSIST ME IN REPAIRING MY ENGINE OR EVEN GIVEN ME ANY ALTERNATIVES OTHER THAN IT WOULD COST ME $10,500.00 TO REPAIR.  THE SHOP MANAGER EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THE 2.7 ENGINES ARE REALLY CRAP AND THERE IS NOT MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE TO CORRECT THIS OBVIOUS DEFECT.  I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED THAT THESE ENGINES WERE NOT RECALLED, FOR AS LONG AS I HAVE BEEN AN OWNER OF CARS I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ENGINE GO OUT OR WILL BE GOING OUT WITHOUT ANY WARNING.  I WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE CLASS ACTION SUIT THAT IS PENDING WITH DODGE/INTREPID PROBLEMS.   *NLM",
