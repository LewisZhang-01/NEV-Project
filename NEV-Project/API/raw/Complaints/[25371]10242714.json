        "summary": "AT 47,968 MILES AND WHEN MY MAZDA TRIBUTE WAS FOUR MONTHS OUT OF WARRANTY, I WAS TOLD THAT I NEEDED NEW FRONT BRAKE PADS AND TO HAVE THE ROTORS RESURFACED COSTING $340.  AFTER THEY HAD THE CAR UP, I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH MATERIAL ON THE ROTOR TO RESURFACE AND THAT I WOULD NEED TO HAVE THE ROTORS REPLACED, COSTING $485 BEFORE A COUPON.  I REQUESTED AND STILL HAVE THE PARTS THEY REPLACED AND FEEL THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG AFTER READING OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THIS PROBLEM ON A CAR WITH SO LITTLE MILEAGE (AND MOSTLY HIGHWAY MILES).   ALSO, THE CD PLAYER BROKE ONCE UNDER WARRANTY (IT FAILED TO EJECT OR PLAY CDS) AND WAS REPLACED, BUT HAS BROKEN AGAIN AFTER 18 MONTHS - SAME PROBLEM.  THE CD REPAIR IS VERY EXPENSIVE - ABOUT $500 TO EXCHANGE FOR A REBUILT UNIT AND OVER $300 TO REPAIR MINIMUM AND THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE DESIGN OF THE UNIT.  THE DEALER AND MAZDA COULD NOT TELL ME THE PART NUMBER OR MAKER OF THE UNIT AND A COUPLE OF DEALERS DID NOT EVEN OFFER A REPAIR OPTION, SAYING THE UNIT WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED.  *TR",
