THE FRONT WINDSHIELD HAD A SEVERE CHIP & THE INSTALLER WAS BARELY ABLE TO SAND THIS AREA DOWN ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO SEAL THE WINDSHIELD. I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH & THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM ALONG WITH THE REAR WINDOW REGULATORS BOTH OF WHICH HAVE HAD TO BE REPLACED. THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE EMERGENCY BREAK & THE JEEP DEALERSHIP GIVES ONE REASON FOR THE ABS, ESP AMONG OTHER WHEEL AND BREAKING ISSUES. AND NOW THE ONE THING THAT JEEP IS FINALLY SUPPOSED TO BE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT RATHER THAN ME HAVING TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO THIS VEHICLE FOR, THE GAS TANK RECALL SEEMS TO BE A RIDICULOUS FIX, AND I HAVE BEEN ON A WAITING LIST FOR THIS FOR MONTHS AND STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET IT IN TO GET THIS FIXED. I SAW A NEWS STORY THAT SAID THAT CHRYSLER WAS BEING MANDATED TO FIX THESE VERY POORLY MADE VEHICLES. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE DOES NOT FALL INTO THE OTHER RECALLS WHEN IT HAS BEEN HAVING THE SAME ISSUES. I HAVE BEEN HAVING BREAKING SYSTEM ISSUES AS LONG BACK AS 13 MONTHS AFTER I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE.",
