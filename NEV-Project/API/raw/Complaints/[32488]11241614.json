        "summary": "I FILED BELOW COMPLAINT NUMBER 11229677 AND HAVE HEARD NOTHING.  SO TRYING AGAIN.    LAST FALL I RECEIVED A LETTER AND HAD A KSDS SENSOR INSTALLED TO DETECT AND PREVENT ENGINE FAILURE.   IN MAR THE KSDS KICKED IN AND THE CAR WAS DIFFICULT TO DRIVE.  LUCKILY MY WIFE WAS ONLY 2 MILES FROM HOME.  IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN ON THE HIGHWAY SEEMS LIKE A MAJOR HAZARD.  HAVING THE ENGINE SEIZE WITH THE REAL ISSUE IS PROBABLY WORSE.  WE TOOK THE VEHICLE IN IMMEDIATELY TO THE DEALER, WHO GAVE US A LOANER, THEN CALLED US BACK THE NEXT DAY TO SAY THE VEHICLE WAS COVERED FOR THE EXTENDED WARRANTY AND THE ENGINE WOULD NEED REPLACED.  SEVERAL WEEKS LATER WE CHECKED ON WHEN THE VEH WOULD BE FIXED, WE WERE TOLD THEY WERE DONE WITH OUR VEHICLE.  THEY DID SOMETHING TO THE WIRE HARNESS AND A TEST ON THE ENGINE TO SAY THE VEHICLE WAS OK.  I WOULD LIKE AN EXPLANATION ON THE SITUATION AND WHY IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE.    1.WHY DID THE KSDS KICK IN AND WHY IS MY VEHICLE OK NOW?    2.DID THEY DO SOMETHING (DISABLE) TO PREVENT THE KSDS FROM KICKING IN AGAIN?     3.DID THEY ENHANCE IT TO BETTER DETECT A MORE SERIOUS PROBLEM?  WHAT EXACTLY DID THEY DO WITH THE WIRE HARNESS/KSDS?  4.CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE ENGINE TEST DONE THAT VERIFIES MY ENGINE IS OK, AND FOR HOW LONG DOES THIS APPLY?    5.HOW QUICKLY CAN THE REAL ISSUE HAPPEN?  6.WILL MY CAR STILL BE COVERED BY THE LIFETIME WARRANTY?  7.IS IT SAFE TO DRIVE ON THE HIGHWAY?",
