        "summary": "BOUGHT THIS 2017 SILVERADO IN FEB. 2017 DIDN'T NOTICE THE VERTICAL SCRATCHES IN THE WINDSHIELD UNTIL THE SUN HIT IT JUST RIGHT. THE DEALERSHIP DETERMINED IT WAS A FACTORY DEFECT AND REPLACED IT QUICKLY NO PROBLEM. AT ABOUT 13,000 MILES I NOTICED THAT THE EW WINDSHIELD HAD SCRATCHES LEFT BY THE WIPER BLADES. WHERE THE BLADES REVERSE DIRECTION THE WINDSHIELD IS SCRATCHED SO BAD IT APPEARS MILKY. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER TO SEE ABOUT GETTING IT REPLACED AND WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT THEY COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT AN OKAY FROM GM. I CONTACTED GM'S DIRECTLY. AFTER THEY TALKED TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY TOLD ME THAT THE SCRATCHES WERE MY FAULT FOR \" USING THE WIPERS WITHOUT WASHER SOLUTION\" I HAVE NEVER EVER TURNED THE WIPERS ON WITHOUT PRESSING THE WASHER BUTTON FIRST PERIOD. I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT HE CALLED AND LEFT MESSAGES WITH THE GM CUSTOMER SERVICE REP. AND SHE HAS NOT RETURNED HIS CALLS. YESTERDAY WHILE DRIVING ON A WINDING ROAD THE SUN HIT THE SCRATCHES JUST RIGHT CAUSING ME TEMPORARILY TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE ROAD. I WAS A LIFELONG GM CUSTOMER NOT ANYMORE!!!!",
