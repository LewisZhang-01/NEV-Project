THIS HAS HAPPEN ABOUT 8-10 TIMES SINCE THE FIRST.  IN CHECKING FOR A FIX, I FOUND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPANIES OFFERING A REPAIR SOLUTION AND THIS LOOKS LIKE A COMMON AND DANGEROUS PROBLEM THAT OCCURS OFTEN. I NOTICED THIS HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED BEFORE BUT NOTHING DONE. HAVING YOUR HEADLIGHTS GO OUT SEEMS DANGEROUS ENOUGH TO ME. THE REPAIR PART TO DO IT YOURSELF IS SOLD FOR ABOUT $10.  $125 + TO PURCHASE A REPAIRED LIGHTING CONTROL MODULE. MY FORD DEALER WILL REPLACE THE LCM FOR $650. *TR",
