        "summary": "THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT, OF MY 1999  HONDA CR-V WITH ONLY 86,520 MILES ON THE VEHICLE. IT WAS SHIFTING SLUGGISHLY EVEN BEFORE THE WARRANTY EXPIRED, I JUST DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS NOT NORMAL UNTIL I HAD A DIFFERENT TRANSMISSION INSTALLED. I HAD THE HONDA DEALER SERVICE MY CR-V REGULARLY.  THE FIRST PROBLEM I HAD WAS A NOISE WHEN THE ALL-WHEEL DRIVE ENGAGED IN HEAVY SNOW IN DECEMBER OF 2000. THE DEALER \"REPLACED CVT FLUID PER TRANSMISSION NOISE\" ACCORDING TO THE INVOICE. THE CR-V HAD 26,375 MILES AT THAT SERVICE INVOICE DATE. THE FLUIDS WERE CHANGED AGAIN AT 30,000 MILES. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AT 65,000 MILES AND FLUIDS WERE CHANGED. AT 72,000 MILES THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND FLUIDS WERE CHANGED AGAIN! FINALLY AT 86,495 MILES THE TRANSMISSION WAS SLIPPING AND FLUIDS WERE CHANGED BUT AT 86,520 THE TRANSMISSION WOULD HARDLY SHIFT TO MAKE IT TO THE DEALER AND A USED TRANSMISSION WAS INSTALLED. DOES HONDA STAND BEHIND THEIR VEHICLES AND OFFER ANY PAYMENT OR EXTENDED WARRANTY? I AM IN SHOCK THAT MY HONDA WOULD HAVE THIS PROBLEM WITH SO FEW MILES, AFTER ALL THE GREAT REPORTS I READ BEFORE BUYING A HONDA!    *NLM",
