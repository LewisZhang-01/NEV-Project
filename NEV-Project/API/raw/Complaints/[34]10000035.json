        "summary": "MY 20 MONTH OLD SON WAS PROPERLY HARNESSED IN HIS CHILD SEAT IN THE BACK SEAT OF MY JEEP CHEROKEE.  WE HAD JUST PULLED UP TO A DRUGSTORE AND MY HUSBAND AND I WERE DISCUSSING WHAT WE NEEDED TO PURCHASE.  I GLANCED BACK TO CHECK ON MY SON AND TO MY HORROR, HE WAS FOAMING AT THE MOUTH, HIS EYES WERE GLASSY AND GAZING AT ME AS IF TO SAY, \"PLEASE HELP ME, I'M HURT\".  WE IMMEDIATELY JUMPED OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND MY HUSBAND THREW OPEN THE BACK DOOR AND TOOK NOAH OUT OF HIS CAR SEAT.  WHEN  THE DOOR SWUNG OPEN I REALIZED THAT THE CHILD SUNSHADE THAT IS SUCTIONED TO THE WINDOW WAS HANGING DOWN ON ONE CORNER.  I YELLED TO MY HUSBAND THAT NOAH MUST BE CHOKING ON THE SUCTION CUP AND HE IMMEDIATELY PERFORMED THE HEIMLICH MANUEVER.  THE SUCTION CUP WAS LODGED SO DEEPLY IN NOAH'S THROAT THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO HAVE A COUGHING OR GASPING REFLEX.  THANKFULLY, MY HUSBAND WAS ABLE TO DISLODGE IT OUT OF NOAH'S THROAT AND HE BEGAN TO VOMIT.  HE IS OKAY NOW BUT I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD I NOT LOOKED BACK AT HIM RIGHT WHEN I DID.  THE SUNSHADE IS MANUFACTURED BY \"SAFETY FIRST\" AND IS BLUE ON ONE SIDE, WHITE ON THE OTHER.  THERE ARE NO IDENTIFYING NUMBERS ON IT.  PLEASE MAKE OTHER PEOPLE AWARE OF THIS POTENTIALLY DEADLY PRODUCT.",
