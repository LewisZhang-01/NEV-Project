YOU CAN FEEL THE ABS PULSING BUT THERE IS NO PRESSURE GETTING TO THE CALIPERS AS IF NO BRAKES ARE APPLIED. THE PEDAL IS ROCK HARD WHEN THE ABS IS ON.  THE FIRST FAILURE CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO MISS AN INTERSECTION AND GO THROUGH A SNOW BANK NEARLY HITTING A TREE. AFTER CAREFUL TESTING THE PROBLEM IS ONLY WHEN THE ABS KICKS IN. AGAIN THE BRAKES ARE FINE ON THEIR OWN.  THANK YOU.   *NLM",
