THE VEHICLE SLOWED TO THE DESIRED RATE OF TRAVEL AND THE LEVER WAS RELEASED.  THE CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM WAS SUPPOSED TO MAINTAIN THE SAME SPEED AS WHEN RELEASED, BUT THE VEHICLE ACCELERATED APPARENTLY BACK TO THE PREVIOUS SET POINT.    I CONTACTED SUBARU OF AMERICA BY E-MAIL AND THEY STATED THAT I SHOULD TAKE THE VEHICLE INTO MY LOCAL SUBARU DEALER.  THE DEALER FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM AFTER PERFORMING THEIR ELECTRONIC TESTS.  I ASKED THEM TO CONTACT SUBARU OF AMERICA TO SEE IF THEY HAD RELEASED ANY BULLETINS REGARDING THIS PROBLEM AND THE PERSON CONTACTED AT SUBARU  (JODY) STATED TO KENT MELCHIOR OF ED REILY SUBARU IN CONCORD, NH THAT THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE PROBLEM ACCORDING TO HIS REPORT TO ME ON 6/7/2006.  AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE NHTSA COMPLAINT WEBSITE, THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL COMPLAINTS AGAINST SUBARU FOR THIS TYPE OF AN INTERMITTENT CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM FAILURE.  THEREFORE, SUBARU OF AMERICA IS EITHER INCOMPETENT OR LYING.  *NM",
