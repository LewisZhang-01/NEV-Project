        "summary": "THE DEFECT(S) RELATE TO THE EXTENDED CAB VERSION OF THE VEHICLE WITH A 3RD DOOR ON THE DRIVERS SIDE.  3RD DOOR UPPER LATCH HAS BROKEN SEVERAL TIMES. PART IS MADE FROM STEEL ROD STOCK WHICH IS FORMED INTO A U SHAPE THEN STAMPED TO FORM HOLES FOR THE MOUNTING SCREWS AND THE SERRATED MOUNTING SURFACE. FAILURE EACH TIME HAS BEEN METAL FATIGUE WHERE THE METAL IS STAMPED AND IS DUE TO THE METAL BECOMING FATIGUED BY HITTING THE UPPER STRIKER/LATCH ASSEMBLY. THIS KEEPS THE 3RD DOOR FROM LATCHING AT THE TOP LETTING RAIN AND FUMES ENTER THE CAB. THE DEALER REPLACED IT ON EACH FAILURE BUT ADVISED ME THAT THIS IS A COMMON DEFECT AND NOTHING CAN BE DONE TO PREVENT THIS.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS KEEPS THE DRIVERS DOOR FROM LATCHING CORRECTLY AND THE DRIVERS SIDE SHOULDER BELT IS ATTACHED TO THE 3RD DOOR.  ADDITIONALLY THE LATCHING RELEASE HANDLE BREAKS WITH ABOUT THE SAME FREQUENCY. THIS PREVENTS THE RELEASE OF THE 3RD DOOR AND MAKES ENTRY AND EGRESS FROM THE REAR JUMP SEAT VERY DIFFICULT. THIS WOULD KEEP A PASSENGER TRAPPED IN THE VEHICLE UNTIL THEY COULD RELEASE A FRONT SEAT AND CLIMB OVER IT.    *NLM",
