I WAS ON MY WAY HOME AND WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT WHICH DESTROYED THE FRONT END OF THE BLAZER WHEN IT STRUCK THE MEDIAN WALL.  WHEN THIS HAPPENED, NEITHER AIRBAG DEPLOYED IN THE CAB OF THE VEHICLE. I WILL BE CONTACTING GENERAL MOTORS CONCERNING THIS ISSUE.  I ALSO HAVE PHOTOS OF THE VEHICLE AFTER THE ACCIDENT TO VERIFY THAT THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.  *JB",
