        "summary": "SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WHILE DRIVING WITH THE ENGINE TEMPERATURE IN THE NORMAL RANGE ON THE FREEWAY TRAVELING AT BETWEEN 70-75 MPH THE ENGINE STALLS AND WILL NOT RESTART.  WHEN PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AFTER LOOKING UNDER THE HOOD AND REMOVING THE TIMING PLUG AND ALLOWING THE IGNITION MODULE TO COOL FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES THE ENGINE RESTARTS.  THE ENGINE WILL NOT RESTART WITHOUT REMOVING THE TIMING PLUG.  I HAVE REPLACED THE IGNITION MODULE AND THE IGNITION MODULE PICKUP WITH ORIGINAL FACTORY REPLACEMENT PARTS.  THE PROBLEM GOES AWAY FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN RESURFACES AFTER ABOUT A FEW WEEKS AFTER REPLACEMENT.  A CALIFORNIA JUDGE HAS ORDERED A RECALL TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM HOWEVER FORD MOTOR COMPANY WILL NOT COMPLY UNLESS THE NHTSA ORDERS THEM TO DO SO.  I WILL CONTINUE TO REPLACE THE PARTS AS TO NOT ENDANGER MYSELF OR OTHERS ON THE FREEWAY.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.     *AK    *NLM     **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*734328",
