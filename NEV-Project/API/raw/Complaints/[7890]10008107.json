I HAVE HAD THE PROBLEM OCCUR AS I TAKE A 200 MILE TRIP ON THE TURNPIKE.  ON EACH OF THREE TRIPS A TIRE HAS GONE BAD, ON THE LAST TRIP TWO TIRES WENT BAD.  THE FIRST TIRE I REPLACED ON MY OWN, THE SECOND TIRE I CONTACTED CONTINENTAL AND THEY SENT ME TO AN AUTHORIZED DEALER WHERE THEY FOUND THE TIRE DEFECTIVE (TREAD SEPARATION).  I WAS OFFERED A PRO-RATA PRICE FOR THE TIRE.  CURRENTLY I CONTACTED CONTINENTAL ONCE AGAIN AND THEY TOLD ME TO GO TO THE AUTHORIZED DEALER TO CHECK THE TIRES.  I FEEL THAT THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED OCCURANCE AND HAVING THE FOUR TIRES WITH THE SAME PROBLEM WITHIN THIS SHORT TIME FRAME IS UNUSUAL AND DANGEROUS.  THE TRIPS I HAVE TAKEN INCLUDE MY WHOLE FAMILY, THIS IS A SERIOULY SAFETY CONCERN.*JB",
