        "summary": "FACTORY TRAILER BRAKE CONNECTOR PLUG IS LOOSE AND CAUSES TRAILER BRAKES TO BECOME INOPERATIVE WHEN THE TRAILER MALE PLUG JIGGLES INSIDE THE TRUCK FEMALE PLUG.  I BELONG TO SEVERAL RV RELATED SITES ON THE INTERNET, AND THIS ISSUE IS COMING UP MORE OFTEN WITH PEOPLE THINKING IT IS JUST THEIR PLUG OR CONNECTOR.  MINE FIT FINE IN MY 2004 TAHOE, BUT IS VERY LOOSE ON THE NEW TRUCK.  OTHERS ARE SAYING THEIRS ALSO FIT OTHER BRANDS OF PREVIOUS OWNED TRUCKS OR EARLIER CHEVY YEAR MODELS.  THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE, AS GOING DOWN A MOUNTAIN OR THROUGH AN INTERSECTION WITH NO TRAILER BRAKES IS GOING TO GET PEOPLE HURT AND KILLED.  THE PLUG WAS NOT MANUFACTURED WITH THE PROPER TOLERANCE FOR A GOOD SNUG FIT.  THE LITTLE SAFETY DOOR WITH THE TAB ON IT HELPS TO HOLD IT IN PLACE, BUT THE FIT IS STILL SO LOOSE THAT THE CONNECTION IS LOST TO LIGHTS AND BRAKES.  IT IS LOOSE WHEN YOU SLIDE IT IN, BUT THE BUMPINESS AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE VEHICLES MAKES IT LOSE THE CONNECTION.  I BROUGHT THIS UP TO THE DEALER THAT I PURCHASED THE TRUCK FROM, BUT IT SEEMED TO BE A NON ISSUE WITH THEM.  I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WITH GM AND QUICKLY.  WE ALL KNOW OF THEIR RECORD ON FAULTY SWITCHES ETC.  THESE PLUGS NEED TO BE REPLACED WITH PROPER FITTING ONES.  THANK YOU  *TR",
