SOMETIMES BRAKE PEDAL ALMOST GOES TO FLOOR BEFORE ENGAGING.  THE PROBLEM STARTED SPORADICALLY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO (ABS FAULT LIGHT WITH NO NOTICEABLE PROBLEM). SEVERAL VISITS TO DEALER, BUT NO REMEDY. ABOUT 18 MONTHS AGO, PROBLEM BECAME MORE SEVERE WITH ACTUAL LOSS OF BRAKES OCCURRING.  IT SEEMS FROM NEWSGROUPS THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS YEAR VOLVO, SO I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS A ISOLATED INCIDENT.     *NLM",
