LOSE BRAKING POWER, CAUSING DRIVER TO PUSH BRAKE VERY HARD TO STOP AND BRAKE PEDAL SOMETIMES GOES TO THE FLOOR AND YOU HAVE TO USE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO STOP. DEALER COULDN'T LOOK AT THE CAR FOR THREE WEEKS SAID ITS OKAY TO DRIVE IN \"MANUAL MODE\", HOWEVER MANUAL MODE ONLY USES REAR BRAKES AND WILL TAKE VEHICLE A LONG DISTANCE TO STOP IN RAINY CONDITIONS.(I WENT THROUGH A BUSY INTERSECTION IN THE RAIN AND ALMOST HAD AN ACCIDENT SO LEFT IT AT THE DEALER). DEALER HAD VEHICLE FOR ALMOST SIX WEEKS, REPLACED THE ABS HUC TWICE, FINALLY CALLED FORD. FORD ADVISED TO REPLACE ALL BRAKE HOSES \"DUE TO RESTRICTIONS\". DEALERS ARE TELLING OWNERS THEY HAVE TO REPLACE ABS HCU AND PART ALONE COST $4700.00. HOWEVER, FORD KNOWS OF THE PROBLEM AND IS NOT PUTTING OUT A BULLETIN OR RECALL, UNTIL SOMEONE GETS KILLED. OWNERS ARE TRADING THE UNSAFE CAR BECAUSE THE DEALER IS MISDIAGNOSING THE REAL PROBLEM WHICH COST APPROXIMATELY $300.00",
