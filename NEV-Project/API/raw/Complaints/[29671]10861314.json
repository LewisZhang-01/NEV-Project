WITH BOTH BRAKE AND EMERGENCY BRAKE FULLY ENGAGED THE CAR STILL WENT WITH A SPEED FASTER THAN MOST OF THE CARS ON THE ROAD.  I WAS FORCED TO DRIVE THE CAR IN THE GRASS INTERMEDIATE  AREA FOR ~10 SECONDS TILL THE CAR ROLLED OVER AND THE ENGINE FINALLY CAME TO A STOP.  THIS RAV4 WAS RECALLED BY TOYOTA AND HAD ITS \"STUCK GAS PEDAL\" PROBLEM FIXED A FEW YEARS AGO.  TOYOTA ALSO FIXED THE EXCESSIVE ENGINE OIL CONSUMPTION PROBLEM LAST YEAR AND I HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH TOYOTA'S SERVICE AND HOW THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CAR IN GENERAL TILL THIS LIFE THREATENING EVENT OCCURRED YESTERDAY.",
