I HAVE CARRIED THE VEHICLE TO THE FORD DEALER AND REPORTED THIS COMPLAINT SEVERAL TIMES. ON MY LAST COMPLAINT TO THE DEALER, THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT STATED THERE WAS A FACTORY TSB ISSUED FOR THIS PROBLEM. THE DEALER ORDERED THE PARTS FOR THE TSB AN WE CARRIED THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER AND LEFT IT FOR TWO DAYS FOR THEM TO COMPLETE THE REPAIR. THE ODOR PROBLEMS STILL EXISTS. I HAVE A 4 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER WITH ASTHMA AND OTHER BREATHING PROBLEMS. I HAVE CARRIED HER TO SCHOOL AND PICKED HER UP EVERYDAY IN THIS VEHICLE FOR THREE YEARS NOW. I WONDER IF HER HEALTH COULD BE AFFECTED BY THIS DEFECT?",
