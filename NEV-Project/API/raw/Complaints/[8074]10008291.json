ALTHOUGH NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED BECAUSE THE CAR WAS TRAVELING AT LESS THAN 5 MILES PER HOUR AT THE TIME, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS SITUATION.  FORD'S RESPONSE HAS BEEN LESS THAN SATISFACTORY.  DESPITE THE FACT THAT I PROMPLTLY NOTIFIED FORD OF THE INCIDENT, NO ONE AT FORD'S CONSUMER AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT HAS CONTACTED ME TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM AS PROMISED.  IN FACT, WHEN I CALLED FORD ON MARCH 1, 2003 TO FOLLOW-UP, A TELEPHONE REPRESENTATIVE INFORMED ME THAT FORD'S COMPUTER RECORDS SHOW THAT A CONSUMER AFFAIRS AGENT HAD CONTACTED ME ON FEBRUARY 27, 2003.  I RECEIVED NO SUCH CALL AND I AM STILL WAITING TO HEAR FROM AN AGENT FROM THAT DEPARTMENT.   IN ADDITION, FORD DID NOT AUTHORIZE THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF MY DEALERSHIP TO EXAMINE THE VEHICLE UNTIL FRIDAY, JANUARY 28, 2003.  *JB",
