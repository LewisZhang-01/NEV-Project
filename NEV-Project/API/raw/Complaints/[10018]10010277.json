THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT TONY BETTEN FORD IN GRAND RAPIDS, MI DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM ON MARCH 7, 2003. BETTEN REPORTED TO ME THAT A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF SPEEDOMETERS HAVE FAILED ON 1996 FORD WINDSTARS AND 1996 FORD ESCORTS.  I WAS ALSO TOLD BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT FORD HAS NOT RECALLED THE MODELS BECAUSE \"THEY (FORD MOTOR COMPANY) DON'T CONSIDER A FAILED SPEEDOMETER A SAFETY ISSUE.\"  IN MY VIEW FORD SHOULD RECALL AND PAY FOR REPAIRS.  IF SPEEDOMETERS AREN'T A SAFETY ISSUE THEN WHY DON'T WE ALL DRIVE INTUITIVELY?  UNDER SEPARATE COVER I AM WRITING MY CONGRESSMAN REPRESENTATIVE VERN EHLERS SO THAT HIS OFFICE MIGHT OFFER YOU ASSISTANCE.*JB",
