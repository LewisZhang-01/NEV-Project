VISITED CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP ON MAY 8; CLAIMS FAULTY REGULATOR RING IN FRONT HUBS CAUSING ABS TO ACTIVATE AT INCORRECT INTERVALS. COULD NOT TELL ME WHICH ONE WAS BAD! WANTED TO TRY TO REPLACE ONE, IF THAT DIDN'T WORK WOULD REPLACE OTHER. ALL AT COST TO ME! $1000 FOR REPAIRS. I'M AMAZED THEY CAN NOT EVEN DIAGNOSE THEIR OWN FAULTY PARTS AND WANT TO CHARGE ME FOR THEIR TRIAL AND ERROR REPAIRS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE UNNECESSARY REPAIRS BECAUSE OF THEIR INCOMPETENT DIAGNOSIS.  I KNOW OF TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM, THEY HAVE THE SAME MODEL AND MAKE, DIFFERENT YEARS: 2000, AND 2001.  *NLM",
