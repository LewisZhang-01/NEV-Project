I MEASURED .033 VERTICLE FREE PLAY OF THE STEERING KNUCKLE, BUT MINIMAL LATERAL PLAY.  ACCORDING TO DAIMLERCHRYSLER, THE -QUOTE- \"NEW WAY OF CHECKING PLAY\" ONLY REGISTERS .010 FREEPLAY, AND THE BALL JOINT HAS TO HAVE .060 TO BE DECLARE DEFECTIVE.  AS SUCH DAIMLERCHRYSLER DENIED MY REPAIR.  IN MY OPINION BY THE TIME THE LATERAL PLAY MEASURES .060, THE VERTICLE PLAY WILL DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO CATASTROPHIC FAILURE.
