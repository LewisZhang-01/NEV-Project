        "summary": "THE TRANSMISSION IN MY 2001 BUICK REGAL GS, WHEN FIRST PURCHASED, HAD A CLUNK IN IT AT ABOUT 42-45 MPH, AFTER LETTING GO OF THE ACCELERATOR, AND COASTING DOWN A HILL.  I HAD TOLD THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT IT, BUT THEY COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  FINALLY THE 10TH TIME, I HAD TAKEN THE SERVICE MANAGER OUT TO THE LOCATION WHERE IT WOULD CLUNK.  THEY FINALLY TOOK THE TRANSMISSION APART AND FOUND  THERE WAS A SLIGHTLY STRIPPED SHAFT AND A COUPLE OTHER COMPONENTS BAD IN THE TRANSMISSION.  THE TRANSMISSION HAS NOW DEVELOPED ANOTHER PROBLEM.  IN THE MORNINGS ON MY WAY OUT AND THE CAR SITTING OVERNIGHT, AT ABOUT 20-35 MPH, IT WILL SHIFT RUFF, LIKE IT JERKS YOU AHEAD, LIKE I AM DRIVING A MANUAL TRANSMISSION, NOT USING THE CLUTCH.  HAS ANYONE ELSE EXPERIENCED THESE KIND OF PROBLEMS WITH THEIR REGAL GS?  *JB",
