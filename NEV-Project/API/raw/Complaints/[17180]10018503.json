        "summary": "FUEL SENDING UNIT SHORT/***EXCESSIVE HEAT PRODUCED*** PROBLEM STARTED W/MY WIFE, WHICH DRIVES THE 200 NISSAN XTERRA EXCLUSIVELY. IT STALLED ON HER WHILE DRIVING. WOULD RESTART OFTEN THROUGHOUT THE TRIP SHE WAS ON. THE NEXT DAY I DROVE IT TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM AND DECIDED TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT W/GERMAIN NISSAN OF  COLUMBUS, OHIO. WHILE ON MY WAY THERE IT STALLED FOR GOOD. LEFT ME HIGH AND DRY. I DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A MALFUNCTIONING FUEL PUMP. I REPLACED THE PUMP, FUEL FILTER AND FUEL PUMP RELAY AT THE SAME TIME IN A LOCAL SCHOOL PARKING LOT. NO SUCCESS. STILL NOT STARTING. I THEN HAD MY WIFE TRY TO START THE VEHICLE WHILE I LISTENED FOR THE SOUND OF THE FUEL PUMP RUNNING. I HEARD THE PUMP OPERATE SPORADICALLY. I THEN NOTICED, TO MY SHOCKING SURPRISE, THAT THE FUEL PUMP POWER CONNECTION ON THE FUEL SENDING UNIT WAS GLOWING FROM THE EXCESSIVE HEAT CREATED BY A CORRODED CRACK IN THE INLET CONNECTION SIDE OF THE PUMP POWER SOURCE. I IMMEDIATELY DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY AND HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIRS AS I FELT THIS WOULD BE A DEFINITE SAFETY RECALL. TO MY SURPRISE IT IS NOT. I ASKED THIS AFTER ALLOWING THE SERVICE MAN TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM OF HIS OWN. I WAS TOLD OF THE SAME GLOWING AFFECT SEEN FROM HEAT CREATED AT THE ELECTRICAL SHORT. I INQUIRED IF THIS WAS SEEN BEFORE AND THE TECH SAID IT IS COMMON. HE ALSO WRAPPED THE PART FOR ME TO KEEP AS \"I MAY NEED THIS FOR FUTURE RECALL REIMBURSEMENT\".        I WONDER HOW LONG IT MAY BE BEFORE SOMEONE'S' CHILD IS BURNED IN A CAR FIRE AS THIS MALFUNCTIONING AND DANGEROUS COMPONENT IS LOCATED LESS THAN 4 INCHES DIRECTLY BELOW THE REAR PASSENGER SEAT!        I AM OUT OVER$400 PLUS TOWING FOR WHAT I HAVE DISCOVERED TO BE A COMMON DEFECT RESULTING IN THE MOST SEVERE OF SAFETY ISSUES. I JUST HOPE I CAN SELL THIS TRUCK BEFORE THE NEW PART. WHICH I AM SURE IS OF THE DEFECTIVE DESIGN, FAILS.   *NLM",
