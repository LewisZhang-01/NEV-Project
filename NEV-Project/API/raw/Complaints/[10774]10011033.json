I CANNOT TURN OFF THE DEFROSTER AND AIR CONDITIONER UNTIL I TURN OFF THE ENGINE. THE AIR CONDITIONER COMPRESSOR STAYS ON UNTIL THE ENGINE IS SHUT DOWN.  IF I AM ON A HIGHWAY I HAVE TO STOP AND TURN THE ENGINE OFF TO TURN THE AIR CONDITIONER OFF, RESTART THE ENGINE, AND THEN MERGE BACK ON THE HIGHWAY.  AT ONE NISSAN DEALERSHIP THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TELLS ME THIS IS NORMAL AND IT IS WRITTEN UP THAT WAY IN THE MANUAL.  YET THEY TELL ME THERE IS A NATIONWIDE BACKORDER FOR A PART.  ANOTHER NISSAN DEALERSHIP TELLS ME THERE IS A PROBLEM BUT THEY ARE UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE WITHOUT TEARING EVERYTHING APART.",
