THE ENGINE STARTED MAKING A RATTLING SOUND ON  4/20/12 AND A MECHANIC RECOMMENDED AN OIL CHANGE BECAUSE  THE OIL WAS BLACK AND LOW. HE DID THE OIL CHANGE.  THE NOISE WENT AWAY AFTER THE OIL CHANGE.  THEN ON 5/6/12 THE RATTLING NOISE CAME BACK.  I CHECKED THE OIL AND IT WAS EXTREMELY LOW.  I ADDED 3 QUARTS.   THEN ON 5/16/12, I CHECKED OIL AGAIN AND HAD TO ADD 1 1/2 QUARTS OF OIL.  THERE ARE NO LEAKS UNDER THE CAR OR INSIDE THE HOOD.  THE CAR IS CONSUMING AN EXCESSIVE  AMOUNT OF OIL. I ONLY DRIVE THE CAR ABOUT 100 MILES PER WEEK AND SOMETIMES LESS. . AND THE \"CHECK OIL\" LIGHT NEVER COMES ON TO INDICATE THAT IT IS LOW. I NOW HAVE TO CHECK THE OIL EVERY OTHER DAY BECAUSE I AM WORRIED THAT IT WILL USE IT ALL.  I HAVE TO KEEP QUARTS OF OIL IN THE TRUNK, IN CASE IT RUNS LOW AGAIN. THIS IS NOT NORMAL.",
