A 18-WHEELER TRUCK WAS DIRECTLY BEHIND ME WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND ALMOST RAN ME OVER SINCE I SUDDENLY SLOWED.  THERE WAS ONE EVENT PRECEDING THIS WHERE MY BIKE WAS WARMING UP AND STALLED.  I THOUGHT I RAN OUT OF GAS, BUT AFTER SOME RESEARCH I FOUND THE PROBLEM TO BE VERY COMMON TO YAMAHA R1'S.  HERE IS A 60+ PAGE THREAD OF ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HAVING PROBLEMS: HTTP://WWW.R1-FORUM.COM/FORUMS/SHOWTHREAD.PHP?THREADID=98831&PERPAGE=20&PAGENUMBER=1.  YAMAHA REFUSES TO ISSUE A TPS RECALL EVEN THOUGH IT HAS CAUSED MULTIPLE CRASHES AND ALMOST KILLED PEOPLE, INCLUDING MYSELF. *JB",
