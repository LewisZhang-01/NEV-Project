        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 1999 FORD EXPEDITION EDDIE BAUER 1 YEAR AGO LAST WEEK. I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE. THE LATEST PROBLEM IS THE ONE THAT CONCERNS ME THE MOST.  A FEW WEEKS AGO THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR LOCK WOULD NOT OPERATE. I COULD HEAR THE MOTOR TRYING TO OPEN THE LOCK BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. A WEEK AFTER THAT I COULD NOT OPEN MY WINDOWS AND THE TURN SIGNALS DID NOT WORK.  A WEEK LATER MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS STOPPED WORKING. WE ATTRIBUTED THE PROBLEM TO A BLOWN FUSE WHICH WE REPLACED. THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO BE FIXED. THE NEXT DAY IT RAINED AND THE FUSE BLEW AGAIN, AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.  THE PROBLEM GOT WORSE AS THE BRAKE LIGHTS WENT OUT.  I BROUGHT THE CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I HAD PURCHASED IT.  THEY DISCOVERED A LEAK IN THE WINDSHIELD THAT SEEPED INTO THE FUSE BOX.  THE FUSE BOX NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER MY WARRANTY (THAT COVERS JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE. FORD ESP EXTRACARE) THIS IN MY OPINION SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO BE PAID FOR OUT OF MY POCKET. IT IS A SAFETY PROBLEM THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN TO ME.  ME VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN IN ANY ACCIDENTS SO I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE WINDSHIELD IS LEAKING. PLEASE CONTACT ME IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.  *NLM",
