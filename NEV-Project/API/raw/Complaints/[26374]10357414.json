        "summary": "MY MOST RECENT CONTACT WITH FORD WAS HIGHLY UNPLEASANT AND DISCOURAGING.  I OWN A 2001 FORD TAURUS WITH 80,000 MILES THAT HAD 2 FRONT COIL SPRINGS AND 1 REAR COIL SPRING BREAK.  I CONTACTED FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE TO INQUIRE WHAT I NEEDED TO DO REGARDING THE RECALL ON THE COIL SPRINGS; I GAVE MY VIN # TO THE AGENT AND WAS TOLD THAT THIS CAR DOES NOT HAVE ANY RECALLS AND FORD COULD NOT OFFER ME ANY SERVICE FOR THE BROKEN SPRINGS.  I THEN CONTACTED AIRPORT FORD IN FLORENCE, KY AND EXPLAINED WHAT I WAS TOLD BY FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THE 3 BROKEN COIL SPRINGS, THEY TOLD ME I COULD NOT BE HELPED SINCE FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID THAT THERE WAS NOT ANY RECALLS ON THIS VEHICLE.  RECALL 04V332000 RECALLED THE FRONT COIL SPRINGS AND EXTENDED THE WARRANTY TO 10 YEARS OR 150,000 MILE, WHICH THIS CAR IS STILL COVERED.  RATHER THAN CONTINUE DRIVING AN UNSAFE VEHICLE, I DECIDED TO GET THE CAR FIXED.  I HAD THE COIL SPRINGS, WHEEL BEARINGS, BALL JOINTS, TIE RODS, DRIVE SHAFTS, AND ROTORS REPLACED ON THIS CAR.  THE 2 BROKEN FRONT COIL SPRINGS DESTROYED EACH OF THESE COMPONENTS BY PLACING UNNECESSARY STRESS ON THESE COMPONENTS.  THE REAR COIL SPRING WAS INCHES AWAY FROM PUNCTURING THE TIRE OF THIS VEHICLE; THIS WAS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.  I BELIEVE THAT AT A MINIMUM THE FRONT COIL SPRINGS SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY FORD DUE TO THE RECALL AND EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THESE FRACTURED SPRINGS; THIS COST ME $343.12.  I FEEL THAT FORD SHOULD COVER THE TOTAL COST OF THIS REPAIR TO MAKE THIS VEHICLE WHOLE AGAIN AT MY COST OF $986.28.  FORD MOTOR COMPANY'S RESPONSE TO THIS COMPLAINT WILL MAKE OR BREAK OUR MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP.  I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR RESPONSE AND HOPE A MUTUAL AGREEMENT CAN BE REACHED. *TR",
