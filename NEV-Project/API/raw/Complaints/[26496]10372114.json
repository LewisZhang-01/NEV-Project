        "summary": "I HAVE A SATURN VUE 2004, BLUE.    ON SATURDAY DEC 11, MERGING ONTO I-495 EAST AT EXIT 31, I ACCELERATED SHARPLY AND STEADILY; 'PEDAL ALL THE WAY DOWN.'  THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS ON BUT NOT ENGAGED.  I'M NOT SURE WHETHER IT WAS TAPPED OR NOT DURING THE ACCELERATION, BUT I DID NOT INTENTIONALLY ENGAGE IT.    REGARDLESS, WHEN I REMOVED MY FOOT FROM THE ACCELERATOR, I DID NOT EXPERIENCE  A RELIEF OF ACCELERATION.  IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THE PEDAL STAYED LOOSE, RELATIVELY.    I TRIED THE BRAKE - IT SLOWED THE ACCELERATION BUT DID NOT STOP IT.  I TRIED THE ACCELERATOR TO LOOSEN IT.  I APPLIED THE BRAKE IN A SUSTAINED FASHION.  I WAS CURRENTLY GOING ~80 MPH, FASTER THAN INTENDED.    AT THIS TIME, I MOVED ONTO THE SHOULDER, TO THE RIGHT, SHIFTED INTO NEUTRAL AND TURNED ON THE BLINKERS.  THE ENGINE RACED AND THE TACHOMETER WAS HIGH.  I BRAKED TO ABOUT 40-50 MPH.  I NOTICED THE CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM WAS ON, AND TURNED IT OFF.  THE ENGINE STOPPED RACING AND I WAS ABLE TO SLOW A BIT MORE.  ONCE I WAS SURE THE VEHICLE WAS UNDER CONTROL, I SHIFTED INTO DRIVE, DEACTIVATED THE BLINKERS, REGAINED SPEED, MERGED OFF THE SHOULDER AND CONTINUED TO MY DESTINATION.  I HAVE HAD NO FURTHER PROBLEMS. *TR",
