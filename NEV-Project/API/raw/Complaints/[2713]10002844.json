IT HAS BEEN TO THE DEALER 2X AND THEY HAVE NOT FOUND THE PROBLEM. JUST APPLYING THE BRAKE WILL KICK THE ENGINE INTO HIGH, AND THE ENGINE MUST BE TURNED OFF TO STOP THE SURGE. IT HAS HAPPEN TO ME 4X IN 2 WEEKS. I HAVE THE CAR BUT WILL NOT DRIVE IT. THE DEALER IS CONSULTING WITH SUBARU. APPARENTLY THIS IS AN ON GOING PROBLEM WHICH AT PRESENT HAS NO SOLUTION. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS DEFECT AND I FEEL IMMEDIATE ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN AND THE PUBLIC NOTIFIED. TS",
