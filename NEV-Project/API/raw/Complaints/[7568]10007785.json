INFORMED, WILL NOT PUT OUT MORE HEAT.  DRIVING IN COLD WEATHER A BLANKET IS USED.  SOME TIMES TURNING LEFT OR RIGHT A BLAST OF HOT AIR COMES OUT OF VENTS.  MORE HOT AIR COMES OUT OF TOP VENTS THAN FLOOR VENTS.  BOTH DEALERS  TESTED CAR AND INFORMED IT WAS WORKING TO FACTORY SPECS.  WE HAVE ASKED TO HAVE THE BUICK AREA REPRESENTIVE CONTACT US ON THIS MATTER.  THIS CAR PURCHASED NEW 12-20-2002 , CURRENTLY HAS ABOUT 1600 MILES.  DEALER SAID WAIT UNTIL THE WEATHER GOT WARMER AND IT WOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE.  HAVE CONTACTED BUICK @ 1-800-521-7300  ASSIGNED  CASE 1-66914926 AND  DORETHA HOLDER, THIS WAS  1-24-2003 @ 1-866-952-4368 X58900 SHE HAS FAILED TO RESPOND TO OUR PHONE CALLS.  CALLED MAIN NUMBER AGAIN NOW TALKING TO ELISA ORTIZ @ 1-866-942-4368 X48335 SHE SAID SHE WOULD TAKE OVER THE CASE.  THE CAR IS NOT ENJOYABLE TO DRIVE IS A HAZARD AS THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT DOES NOT GET ADEQUATE HEAT FOR DEFROSTING WINDOWS AND HEAT THE PASSENGERS.  I TOLD DOBLES THAT WE WOULD CLAIM IT UNDER A LEMON LAW THEY INFORMED US THAT BEING THEY DO NOT FIND A PROBLEM THAT OUR CASE WOULD BE WEAK AND WOULD PERHAPS BE THROWN OUT.  EVERY PERSON THAT HAS BEEN IN THIS CAR IN THE COLD WEATHER COMPLAINS IT IS TOO COLD.   CAN NOT FEEL SAFE IN CAR IN COLD FREEZING WEATHER AS THE WINDOWS ICE UP.  OUR FAMILY OWNS CHEV 2001 SILVERADO, A 1997 CHEV CONVERSION VAN, 1997 CADY- CATERA .  ALL OF THE OTHER CARS WILL PROVIDE ENOUGH HEAT FOR DEFROST AND PASSENGERS.  THIS WILL NOT.  IS THE BURDEN OF PROOF ON US BECAUSE THE FACTORY SAYS IT IS NORMAL?  WE INITIALLY LIKED THE CAR AND ALL WE ASKED IS FOR A RESOLUTION TO OUR PROBLEM.  I HAVE TAKEN CAR TO AN INDEPENDENT SERVICE STATION AND THEY SAID BUICK SHOULD LOOK AT CONNECTIONS IN THE \"AIR CONNECTION BOX\".",
