(ALMOST SEEMS LIKE THE WHEELS ARE GOING TO FALL OFF). I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE ABS KICKING IN. I AM STILL NOT SATISFIED BY THE DEALERS REMEDY. THEY BASICALLY DID NOTHING. THE PROBLEM HAPPENS MOSTLY ON WET SURFACES AND LIGHT SNOW. BUT BECAUSE OF THAT, EVERY TIME I HIT THE BRAKES, I HAVE TO PRAY THE CAR TO STOP. *TR",
