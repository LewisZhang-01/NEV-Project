MY CAR REPAIR SHOP ASSURES ME THAT THE BATTERY IN MY CAR IS FULLY CHARGED AND CAPABLE OF STARTING.  THEY TELL ME THAT THEY HAVE SEEN 5-6 OF THESE ISSUES WITH SATURN IONS IN THE PAST MONTH, AND THAT I MUST TAKE IT TO THE SATURN DEALERSHIP BECAUSE IT IS A KNOWN IGNITION SWITCH ISSUE.   I LIVE IN A FAIRLY SMALL TOWN, THE FACT THAT MY SHOP HAS SEEN THIS MANY ISSUES WITH SATURNS IS ASTOUNDING.  I HAVE SMALL CHILDREN AND THE TEMPS IN INDIANA HAVE BEEN BELOW ZERO.  I FEAR THAT I WILL HAVE THEM OUT SOMEWHERE AND BE UNABLE TO START MY CAR IN SUB-ZERO TEMPERATURES, OR THAT I WILL BE UNABLE TO PICK THEM UP FROM SCHOOL BECAUSE I CANNOT GET MY CAR STARTED.    I HAVE READ ON THE WEB THIS MORNING, THAT I AM NOT ALONE IN MY ISSUES WITH MY SATURN ION.  I REALIZE THAT NO ONE HAS DIED OR BEEN INJURED IN MY PARTICULAR SITUATION, BUT IF SMALL CHILDREN ARE STRANDED IN MY CAR IN SUB-ZERO TEMPS BECAUSE MY CAR WON'T START, IT SEEMS THAT, AT THE VERY LEAST WE HAVE A POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE HERE. *TR",
