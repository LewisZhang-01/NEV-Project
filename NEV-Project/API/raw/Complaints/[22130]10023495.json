I HAD ONE OF THE EGR SENSOR REPLACE ITS LOCATED ON THE FIREWALL AND ALSO I HAD AN OIL CHANGE AND JUST INSTALLED NEW SPARK PLUGS, WIRES, AIR FILTER AND FUEL FILTER AND I HAD A FRIEND HAVE A QUICK LOOK AT THE FUEL RAIL AND THE VACUUM HOSE THEY LOOK FINE. I HERE THAT THE FUEL PUMP IS THE ISSUE WITH LATE MODEL FOCUS. I JUST NOTICE WHEN PARKING THE CAR BACKWARDS AT AN INCLINE IN THE DRIVEWAY, IT WOULD START BUT REV-UP VERY HIGH FOR ABOUT 5-10 SECONDS AND STILL DIE OUT. MY NEXT STEP IS TO HAVE OBD II TEST DONE AT AAA TO SEE IF THEY CAN HELP OUT, IF NOT MY LAST CHOICE IS FORD BUT I RATHER NOT THE HELL THEM FORD, WELL MY POINT IS I ALSO HAVE ACURA 90 WITH 183,000 MILES AND NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE REPAIRS.    *NLM",
