THEN JUST RECENTLY I STARTED DRIVING INTO WORK WHEN I NOTICED THAT MY SPEEDOMETER SAID I WAS DOING ABOUT 100 MPH ON CITY STREETS AND CONFIRMED IT WAS INACCURATE WHEN I CAME TO A STOPLIGHT AND CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP BUT THE SPEEDOMETER READ 50 MPH.  WHEN I GOT TO WORK I STOPPED THE ENGINE AND STARTED IT BACK UP AND I HAD TO REPEAT THIS PROCESS 7-8 TIMES TO GET IT TO RESET BACK TO 0 MPH THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT OCCURRED SINCE I GOT IT.  *TR",
