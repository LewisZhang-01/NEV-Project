THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION REGARDING ALL HEAD AND TAIL LIGHTS.  THE LIGHTS FAIL FREQUENTLY,ESPECIALLY ALL REAR LIGHTS WITH NO WARNING.  MANY HAVE BEEN REPLACED.  THE HEADLIGHTS ARE A HUGE HEADACHE.  TO HAVE THE DEALER REPLACE THE BULBS COST ABOUT $250-$300.  IF THERE IS MORE THAN JUST A BULB REPLACEMENT, THE COST COULD GO AS HIGH AS $1000+.  THIS IS HIGHWAY ROBBERY.  *TR",
