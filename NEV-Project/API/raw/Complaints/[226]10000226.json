MY DEALER SAID I HAD RECEIVED A CHECK BEFORE I BOUGHT IT.  I DID NOT.  I DROVE IT OFF THE SHOWROOM FLOOR.  NOW I HAVE TO BUY OVER $400 WORTH OF TIRES AND HAVE AN ALIGNMENT.  THE LOCAL DEALER SAID I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE HAD A PRETTY GOOD LICK FOR IT TO HAVE ALL 4 OUT OF ALIGNMENT.  I DO NOT HOTDOG THIS CAR.  I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT",
