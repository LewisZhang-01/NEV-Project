I ONLY HAVE 18,700 TOTAL MILES ON THE CAR.  THE FIRST INCIDENT OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 8500 MILES AND THE DEALER REPLACED THE REQUIRED PARTS ACCORDING TO THE TECHNICAL BULLETIN ISSUED BY DAIMLER CHRYSLER.  THE SECOND TIME (SAME EXACT SHIMMY INDICATION), I WAS TOLD THAT THE ROTORS HAD TO BE TURNED AND THAT IT WAS A HEAT PROBLEM AND NOT COVERED UNDER ANY WARRANTY.  FURTHERMORE, THE PROBLEM WAS PERHAPS A DRIVER HABIT AND NOT ANY FAULT OF THE MANUFACTURE.  I PAID THE BILL AND INFORMED THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT I WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THIS SITUATION AND WANTED HIM TO VERIFY THROUGH HIS DISTRICT MANAGER THAT THIS WAS APPROPRIATE ACTION AND NOT A WARRANTY ITEM.  HE SAID THAT HE WOULD AND GET BACK WITH ME.  *NLM",
