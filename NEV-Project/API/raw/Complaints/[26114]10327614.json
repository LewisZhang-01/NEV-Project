        "summary": "I OWN A 2009 TOYOTA COROLLA WITH 19,000 MILES. I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER. I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR IN TWICE FOR A PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES. I HAVE OWNED MANY CARS BUT NONE HAVE EVER FELT SO UNRESPONSIVE WHEN YOU HIT THE BRAKES, ESPECIALLY IN THE EVENT OF A FAST STOP. THE DEALERS TELL ME THIS IS NORMAL FOR VACUUM ASSISTED BRAKES. A BRAKE PEDAL THAT GOES ALMOST TO THE FLOOR WHEN STOPPING AND REQUIRES DANGEROUS DISTANCES TO FULLY STOP IS NOT NORMAL, AND IF TOYOTA HAS DESIGNED THE SYSTEM TO FUNCTION LIKE THIS THEY HAVE A BAD DESIGN FOR A MAJOR VEHICLE SAFETY FUNCTION. THE BRAKING SYSTEM IN THE 2009 TOYOTA COROLLA MAY BE A DANGEROUS DESIGN FLAW. YOU MAY NEED TO EVALUATE THIS FUNCTION OF THE TOYOTA. *TR",
