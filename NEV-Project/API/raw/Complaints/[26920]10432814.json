        "summary": "DAYLIGHT RUNNING LIGHTS BURN /MELT THE LENS DUE TO EXCESSIVE HEAT, IN LESS THEN 30K MILES. I BELIEVE TOYOTA HAS A DESIGN PROBLEM WITH THE DRLS. EVERY TACOMA WITH THE DRL OPTION WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE THIS PROBLEM.  THE COMPARTMENT THAT HOLDS THE DLR LIGHT IS SMALL, WITH NO VENTILATION, AND THE LAMP DISSIPATES APPROXIMATELY 28 WATTS OF HEAT, WHICH IS FOCUSED TOWARD THE LENS (ALONG WITH THE LIGHT).  IT IS SIMPLY TOO MUCH HEAT IN TOO SMALL AN AREA, AND THE HEAT IS SUFFICIENT TO MELT THE PLASTIC LENS IN FRONT OF THE LAMP.  SINCE THE DRL IS PART OF THE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY, THE COST OF PARTS IS REPORTED TO BE AROUND $700 PLUS LABOR. I BELIEVE THAT LENSES (WITH PROPER LAMPS) SHOULD NEVER MELT.  ASKING TACOMA OWNERS TO PAY $700 +, EVERY 30K MILES IS OUTRAGEOUS!  MY HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLIES WERE REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY, BUT THEY ARE SURE TO FAIL AGAIN IF SOMETHING IS NOT DONE TO CORRECT THE DESIGN OF THE DLRS.  IT APPEARS THAT TOYOTA IS IGNORING THE PROBLEM AND HOPING MOST PEOPLE WON'T RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM UNTIL AFTER THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  NOW I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS CONDITION WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO AN ELECTRICAL FIRE.  *TT",
