SUNDAY WHILE I WAS DRIVING THE STEERING WENT OUT IT FELT AS THOUGH THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED MID TURN CAUSING ME TO LOSE CONTROL OF MY VEHICLE NEARLY WRECKING LUCKILY THERE WASN'T ANY OTHER CARS CLOSE BY WHEN I GOT HOME I RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM ONLY TO FIND THAT IT'S A VERY COMMON ISSUE AND THAT 2007 MALIBU IS THE ONLY YEAR NOT COVERED BY THE RECALL EVEN THOUGH MANY OWNERS ARE HAVING THIS PROBLEM. CHEVY KNOWS THAT THEIR POWER STEERING IS FAULTY YET THEY REFUSE TO HELP 2007 MODEL OWNERS. HAD I OF BEEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY OR HAD I NOT BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE THE ONLY CAR ON THAT ROAD AT THE TIME PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT.  *TR",
