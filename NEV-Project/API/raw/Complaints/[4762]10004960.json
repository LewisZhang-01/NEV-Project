YOU CAN FORCE IT TO START BY PUTTING MORE GAS THRU THE ACCELERATOR. BUT WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE IT WILL DIE ON THE ROLLING.  THIS ALMOST CAUSED ME AN ACCIDENT.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER, THE HONDA DEALER CANNOT FIND ANY THING WRONG WITH IT.  I SEARCH ON THE DATABASE AND IT MIGHT BE RELATED TO A VAPOR LOCK ISSUE WITH THE HONDA ACCORD 2000 V6. (ODI-719977).  PLEASE INVESTIGATE AND ISSUE SOME HAZARD WARNING TO THE PUBLIC.",
