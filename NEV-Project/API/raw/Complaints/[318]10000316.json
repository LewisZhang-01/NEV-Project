WHEN DECELERATING, THE SEAT BACK MOVES FORWARD CAUSING THE DRIVER'S TORSO TO ALSO MOVE FORWARD. THIS CAUSES THE DRIVER TO PUT EXCESSIVE PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL WHICH CAUSES EXCEPTIONALLY HARD, FAST, AND UNCONTROLLED STOPS. SINCE THE SEAT BELT RETRACTOR IS PART OF THE SEAT BACK, THIS MAY ALSO CAUSE THE DRIVER NOT TO BE PROPERLY RETAINED TO THE SEAT IN THE EVENT OF A COLLISION. DEALER WAS NOTIFIED ON 12/7/02. TS",
