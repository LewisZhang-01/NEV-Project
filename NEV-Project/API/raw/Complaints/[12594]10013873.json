THE POWER STEERING SHUT DOWN AND IT WAS HARD TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  IF IT IS RAINING OUTSIDE, YOU MAY AS WELL JUST PARK IT.  IT WILL NOT CRANK EASILY AND IT ACTS LIKE IT DOESN'T WANT TO RUN ONCE YOU GET IT TO START.  OF COURSE, WHEN YOU TAKE IT TO THE SHOP THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT.  MY DRIVER'S SIDE POWER WINDOW WILL NOT ROLL DOWN.  THE LOW TIRE PRESSURE LIGHT GOES OFF EVERY OTHER DAY, EVEN THOUGH THE AIR PRESSURE IS FINE AND THE INTERIOR DOORS LOOK AWFUL BECAUSE THE TRIM HAS COME UNGLUED.  THIS IS THE WORST CAR I HAVE EVER PURCHASED.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT I CAN DO TO GET THIS CAR REPAIRED OR REPLACED.",
