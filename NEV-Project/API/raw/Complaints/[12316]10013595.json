AFTER ONLY 5,000 MILES, THE VEHICLE PULSATED WHILE BRAKING.  SO AT 73,091 MILES AT HAD FRONT BRAKES RESURFACED, AT WHICH TIME THE MECHANIC ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE BRAKES WERE ALREADY SHOWING SIGNS OF OVER HEATING AND WERE ALREADY WARPED.  I HAD REAR BRAKES DONE (EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD SUFFICIENT LIFE REMAINING) AT THE SAME TIME IN CASE THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROBLEM.  I NOW HAVE 16,000 MILES ON THE FRONT BRAKES (10,000 MILES AFTER FIRST RESURFACING), THEY AGAIN ARE PULSATING STRONGLY, AND REQUIRE UNDUE PRESSURE FROM MY FOOT TO MAKE THEM WORK APPROPRIATELY....ESPECIALLY ON THE HIGHWAY.  I CONSIDER THIS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD AND AS A RESULT OF THE ENGINEERING AND/OR MANUFACTURING OF THE BRAKES.  *JB",
