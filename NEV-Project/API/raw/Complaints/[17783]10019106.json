AFTER ONLY 1 1/2 DAYS OF MINOR OCCURRENCES, BEFORE WE COULD HAVE THE CAR LOOKED AT, THE TRANSMISSION COMPLETELY LOCKED UP.  FORTUNATELY, MY HUSBAND WAS ABLE TO GET IT INTO GEAR TO GET IT OUT OF THE STREET, BUT IT WOULD NOT GET INTO GEAR AT ALL AFTER THAT.  WE HAD TO TOW IT.  WE ARE NOW HAVING TO PAY $2000 TO REBUILD THE TRANSMISSION.    THIS IS OUR ONLY CAR FOR CARRYING OUR TWIN TODDLERS, AND THIS IS THE SECOND CHRYSLER VEHICLE WE HAVE OWNED THAT HAS HAD TRANSMISSION FAILURE BEFORE 70,000 MILES.  MY BEST FRIEND ALSO HAD TO GET RID OF A CHRYSLER LEBARON WITH THE EXACT SAME ISSUE.  THERE IS A SYSTEMATIC PROBLEM WITH CHRYSLER TRANSMISSIONS, AND IT IS A KNOWN DEFECT THAT IS SOLD TO CONSUMERS.  IF WE HAD BOUGHT THIS VAN NEW INSTEAD OF 1 YEAR OLD, I WOULD BE FINDING A LEMON LAW ATTORNEY.   *NLM",
