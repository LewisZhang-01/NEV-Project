THE MB SHOP REPLACED THE OLD SUSPENSION PARTS WITH NEW PARTS FOR ALL FOUR WHEELS. THERE WAS NO DAMAGE TO THE CAR OR CONSEQUENCES AS THE COIL BROKE AT THE END WHERE IT SITS WITHIN THE CUP. IF IT BROKE IN THE MIDDLE, IT COULD HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC. I BELIEVE THERE MAY BE A TEMPERING PROBLEM WITH SPRINGS, WHICH WOULD BE A MANUFACTURING DEFECT. I HAVE THE OLD PARTS IF SOMEONE WISHES TO EXAMINE THEM.  *TR",
