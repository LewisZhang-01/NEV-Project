THE TRANSMISSION SUDDENLY FAILED WHILE BEING DRIVEN BY A FORD DEALERSHIP TECHNICIAN WHILE TEST DRIVING THE VEHICLE AFTER REPLACING A DEFECTIVE AIR INTAKE MANIFOLD. VEHICLE MILEAGE WAS 32621 MILES. WHILE THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT ENVOLVED, THE SUDDENESS OF THE FAILURE OF A MAJOR DRIVE COMPONENT PRESENTS THE HAZARD POTENTIAL THAT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED. AN INTERNET SEARCH HAS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF COMPLAINTS OF SIMILAR PREMATURE AND SUDDEN FAILURES ON THIS VEHICLE AND OTHER MODEL VEHICLES THAT USE THE TRANSMISSION FOUND IN THIS VEHICLE. THIS COMPLAINT IS BEING FILED IN ORDER TO BRING IT INTO THE FEDERAL DATA BASE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE IF A RECALL OF THIS TRANSMISSION IS WARRANTED. I HAVE THE REPLACED COMPONENTS AND WOULD LIKE TO SUBMIT THEM FOR TEST AND ANALYSIS IF THIS AGENCY IS INTERESTED.*AK",
