        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING MY KIDS TO SCHOOL I WAS STOPPED AT A RED LIGHT WHEN THE LOW BRAKE FLUID LIGHT CAME ON. THE TRAFFIC LIGHT TURNED GREEN AND AS I WAS DRIVING I WENT TO APPLY THE BRAKES AND THE PEDAL WENT COMPLETELY TO THE FLOOR. I HAD TO SHIFT THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL AND USE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO ASSIST ME IN STOPPING THE VEHICLE. I STOPPED 2 FEET SHORT OF CRASHING INTO A VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME. I PULLED OVER AND OPENED THE HOOD. THE BRAKE FLUID RESERVOIR WAS ALMOST EMPTY. I STOPPED AT A NEAR BY MIDAS AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS A MASSIVE LEAK FROM THE MASTER CYLINDER TO THE BRAKE BOOSTER (BOOSTER WAS COMPLETELY FILLED WITH BRAKE FLUID). I HAVE SEEN THAT THERE IS A RECALL FOR 2013-2014 F150S THAT ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS PROBLEM IS AFFECTING THE 2015S ALSO. THERE WAS NO WARNING OTHER THAN THE LIGHT COMING ON AND I IMMEDIATELY LOST ALMOST COMPLETE BRAKING POWER TO THE VEHICLE. THIS IS A SERIOUS CONCERN AND A FRIGHTENING ONE AS IT HAPPENS WITH CHILDREN INSIDE THE VEHICLE.",
