DEALER SAY'S IT'S NOT A SAFETY ISSUE AND GENERAL MOTORS WILL FIX IN FIRST QUARTER OF 2006. I CONTACTED CHEVROLET AND CAN'T GET AN ANSWER ON THE SAFETY ISSUE OR WHEN THIS PROBLEM WILL BE CORRECTED. I HAVE BEEN READING MANY AUTOMOBILE WEBSITES AND READ 100'S OF MESSAGES FROM PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SAME NOISE WHEN TURNING AND EVENTUAL LOSS OF STEERING. THE CAR IS TWO YEARS OLD, WHY HASN'T CHEVY FIXED THESE VEHICLES? ARE THEY OR ARE THEY NOT SAFE? WHAT CAN CONSUMERS LIKE MYSELF DO ABOUT THE ISSUE.  *NM",
