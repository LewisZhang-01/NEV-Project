        "summary": "BROKEN ELEVATOR BRACKET ON DRIVERS POWER SEAT.  THE FRONT LEFT BRACKET HAS BROKEN AT THE WELD.  IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THIS WELD HAD BEEN ADEQUATELY FUSED TO THE AXIS SHAFT. THE BRACKET BROKE IN HALF AT THE POINT WHERE IT IS INTERSECTED BY THE AXIS COMPONENT.  SOMETIMES THIS SEAT ROCKS BACKWARD SUDDENLY WHEN DRIVING WHICH DIMINISHES MY ABILITY TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE. I AM MORE CONCERNED THAT THE DRIVERS SEAT IS NOT ANCHORED TO THE VEHICLE CHASSIS AS DESIGNED. IN THE EVENT OF BEING THE VICTIM OF A REAR END COLLISION, I ANTICIPATE BEING THROWN TO THE REAR OF THE CAB DUE TO LACK OF RESTRAINT.  I AM VIRTUALLY THE ONLY PERSON THAT HAS DRIVEN THIS VEHICLE AND THE SEAT HAS ONLY BEEN ELEVATED FROM ITS LOWEST POSITION A FEW TIMES.  THE REPAIR ESTIMATE IS $586 (TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY) AS THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED. THIS FAILURE IS CLEARLY A MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND NOT DUE TO WEAR OR MISUSE. THE FAILURE OF THIS COMPONENT SIGNIFICANTLY COMPROMISES  DRIVER AND OCCUPANT SAFETY.   *JB",
