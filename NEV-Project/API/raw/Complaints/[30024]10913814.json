THERE IS NO MANUAL WAY TO TURN THE LIGHTS OFF. I WAS FORCED TO BACK INTO THE ROAD BLIND ONE NIGHT - WITH A TRAILER - BECAUSE I COULD NOT SEE OUT OF THE CAR.    IT ALSO WILL NOT LET YOU LOCK THE DOORS WHILE DRIVING AND DRAINS THE BATTERY WHEN YOU TURN THE VEHICLE OFF.    I HAD THIS REPAIRED AT MY EXPENSE AT A FORD DEALERSHIP BUT THE PROBLEM RETURNED 4 MONTHS LATER.",
