VEHICLE HAS BETWEEN 48000 AND 49000 MILES ON IT.  WAS TOLD IT WAS SENDING UNIT THEN GOT CALL SAYING THAT IT WASNT AND WOULD HAVE TO DROP OIL PAN.  WAS ALSO TOLD NO SIGN OF COOLANT LEAK OR MIX WITH OIL.  I NOW HAVE RECIEVED CALL INDICATING THAT IT COULD BE BLOWN HEAD GASKET WITH MILES INDICATED ABOVE.  AFTER FURTHER INQUIRE I FOUND THAT NONE OF THE BASIC TESTING WAS DONE TO CHECK FOR OIL AND COOLANT MIX, THIS WAS ADMITED TO ME BY JEFF WHO IS ONE OF THE SERVICE ATTTENDANTS.  JEEP SHOULD BE THE ONE PAYING FOR A BLOWN HEAD GASKET WHEN THE CAR HAS THESE LOW MILES ON IT.  JEEP DEALER SHOULD ALSO BE COVERING COSTS SINCE THEY FAILED THEIR FUDICIARY DUTY TO PROPERLY DIAGNOSE THE CAR WITH THE BASIC CHECKS.",
