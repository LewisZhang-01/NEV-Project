THEY BOTH ACT THIS WAY WHILE TAKING OFF FROM A LIGHT, BACKING OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY AND THEN PUTTING IT IN DRIVE AND ANY OTHER TIME IT FEELS NECESSARY TO DO SO.  EXCEPT WHILE BEING CHECKED BY THE MECHANIC.  WE OWNED A 2007 IMPALA THAT DID THE SAME THING.  OUR REMEDY, PUSH THE TRACTION CONTROL BUTTON TO THE \"OFF\" POSITION.  STOPPED MAKING THE NOISE AND NO LONGER HESITATES AFTER PUTTING IT IN DRIVE.  OF COURSE, WE HAVE TO DO THIS EACH AND EVERY TIME WE GET IN THE CAR.   NO MORE BUYING CHEVY'S FOR US.",
