        "summary": "ON 2 OCCASIONS THE CAR HAS STALLED WHILE MAKING A LEFT TURN.THE FIRST TIME IT WAS IN APRIL 2014.2ND TIME IT HAPPENED WAS AROUND JULY 29TH 2014. I FIRST REPORT IT TO THE DEALERSHIP BACK IN MARCH WHEN I TOOK THE CAR IN FOR A OIL CHANGE. THEY WOULD NOT PUT IT DOWN ON THE PAPER WORK TO LOOK AT IT SINCE THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM. THEN REPORTED IT TO A DIFFERENT DEALERSHIP AS WELL AS KIA. THE NEW DEALERSHIP DID PUT IT DOWN ON PAPERWORK. BUT SINCE THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO REPLICATE THE PROBLEM,THEY WOULD NOT LOOK INTO IT FURTHER. ALSO HAVE REPORTED A ENGINE NOISE TO THE FIRST DEALERSHIP. THEY FIRST TOLD ME IT WAS A STANDARD NOISE. SO WE STARTED GETTING VIDEOS OF THE NOISE. THEY THEN SAID THEY WOULD REPLACE THE ENGINE. THE SAME DAY THAT WE PICKED THE CAR BACK UP FROM THE ENGINE BEING REPLACED WE HEARD A NOISE COMING FROM THE CAR. SOME HOW THE RIGHT DRIVE AXLE GOT BROKE. THEY SAID THEY DID NOT WORK AROUND THAT AREA.SO THEN THAT MEANS THAT THEY COMMITTED FRAUD BY FALSIFYING DOCS WHEN THEY SAID THEY REPLACED THE ENGINE. 2 DAYS AFTER FINALLY GETTING THE CAR BACK THE ENGINE NOISE CAME BACK.NOW I GOT TOLD THAT THEY WILL NOT LOOK AT THE CAR UNTIL THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON OR THE CAR COMES IN ON A TOW TRUCK. NOW THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS THE CAR JUST STALLING WHILE DRIVING? WHAT HAPPENS NOW IF WE GET INTO A ACCIDENT.THIS REALLY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT. KIA NEEDS TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.IT IS NOT NORMAL FOR A CAR WITH LESS THAN 14,000 MILES ON IT TO JUST UP AND STALL. I AM TIRED OF HEARING EVERYTHING IS STANDARD. KIA IS FRAUD THEY DO NOT WANT TO HONOR THEIR WARRANTY THAT THEY SELL.   *TR",
