VERY DANGEROUS WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE POWER IS GONE! AUG. 27, 2018, DRIVING HOME FROM MY SON'S FOOTBALL GAME I LOST ALL POWER ON A DARK WINDING COUNTRY ROAD AND HAD LIMITED ACCESS TO PULL OVER SAFELY WITH MY YOUNG CHILD IN THE BACKSEAT. THE VEHICLE WAS SHAKING AND WOULD NOT MOVE FORWARD. I WAS ABLE TO GET IT TOWED. THE FOLLOWING DAY MY HUSBAND HOOKED HIS CODE READER AND THE CODE PRESENTED P2112 POWERTRAIN FAULT. IT STARTED FINE AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A GLITCH. ON WEDNESDAY AUGUST 28, 2018, WE HEADING TO THE AIRPORT AND IT DID THE EXACT SAME THING ABOUT 20 MINUTES IN. THIS TIME WE WERE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT 70 MPH AND HAD AN ABRUPT DECELERATION WITH SEMIS TRAVELING BEHIND US. WE QUICKLY PULLED OVER AND TURNED THE CAR OFF AND THEN BACK ONE. WE WERE ABLE TO START THE VEHICLE AND CONTINUE DOWN FOR ABOUT 3 MILES BEFORE IT DID IT AGAIN.  AGAIN, WE TURNED VEHICLE OFF AND STARTED BACK UP. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION AND FORD NEEDS TO RECALL SINCE THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE. SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET HURT OR LOSS OF LIFE.",
