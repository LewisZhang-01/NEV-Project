I PULLED OFF THE ROADWAY AND SAW THAT 2 OF THE SPOKES WERE BROKEN.  I RECEIVED A RIDE TO TOWN, GOT THE BIKE TO A SHOP, AND THE SHOP OWNER CALL THE MAKER OF THE WHEEL, AMERICAN WIRE WHEEL OF DENTON, TEXAS WHICH WAS SOLD TO DAYTON WIRE WHEEL.  WE DISCOVERED THAT NHTSA HAD OTHER INVESTIGATIONS ABOUT THESE DEFECTIVE WHEEL, BUT THIS IS NOW ONE MORE INCIDENT INVOLVING THE SUPERSPOKE WHEEL.  PLEASE CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE.  THANK YOU .    *NLM",
