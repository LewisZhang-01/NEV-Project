        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 50 MPH ON A CURVY ROAD, THE POWER STEERING SUDDENLY FAILED.  THIS WAS VERY DISCONCERTING DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CAR WAS IN A FAST LEFT HAND CURVE AT THE TIME BEGINNING TRANSITION TO A RIGHT CURVE.  THE SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER STEERING INPUT CAUSED AN UNCOMMANDED LANE CHANGE TO THE RIGHT LANE WHICH NEARLY CAUSED A COLLISION WITH THE VEHICLE THAT WAS IN THE RIGHT LANE JUST AFTER OUR REAR BUMPER. THE VEHICLE WAS MANEUVERED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND INSPECTED FOR A LOOSE OR BROKEN POWER STEERING BELT.  UPON FURTHER INSPECTION IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE SNAP RING WHICH RETAINS THE POWER STEERING PUMP VANE AND VALVE BODY ASSEMBLY HAD PARTIALLY UNSEATED.  WE WERE ABLE TO PUSH THE VALVE BODY BACK INTO THE PUMP AND PRESS THE SNAP RING BACK INTO THE RETAINER BOSS (LAND). THE CAR WAS RESTARTED AND SUFFICIENT FLUID WAS PRESENT IN THE RESERVOIR TO PROVIDE NORMAL STEERING INPUT.  ABOUT TWO MILES DOWN THE ROAD AND ANOTHER SUDDEN FAILURE OCCURRED. THERE WAS NO WARNING, NO SHIMMY, OR GRADUAL LOSS OF STEERING INPUT. THE CAR WAS AGAIN RE-INSPECTED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. THIS TIME THE SNAP RING WAS GONE, THE VALVE BODY AND VANE ASSY. HAD EJECTED AN WAS ON TOP OF THE BATTERY. POWER STEERING FLUID WAS EVERY WHERE. THE CAR WAS DRIVEN HOME WITH SIGNIFICANT EFFORT AND PARKED. I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT THE DEALER TWICE SINCE THIS INCIDENT. DUE TO MY WORK.    *JB    ****DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****769327",
