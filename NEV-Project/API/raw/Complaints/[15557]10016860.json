I CAN'T EVEN WASH THE CAR, BECAUSE EACH TIME I DO MORE PATCHES OF PAINT COME OFF.  I HAVE NOTICED THIS SAME PROBLEM ON EVERY NEON THAT IS THE PURPLISH (PERIWINKLE) COLOR I HAVE SEEN.  IS THERE SOME KIND OF PAINT DEFECT WITH THIS PARTICULAR COLOR.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THE PAINT WAS ONLY UNDER WARRENTY FOR 12 MONTHS, AND SINCE IT WAS A 1996 AND I WASN'T THE ORIGINAL OWNER THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO.  I REALIZE IT IS AN OLDER CAR, AND I WOULN'T COMPLAIN IF IT WAS NORMAL WEAR ON A CAR, BUT THIS IS MORE THAN NORMAL AGING.",
