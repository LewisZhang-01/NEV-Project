IT HAS BEEN TO THE DEALER TWICE AND THEY TELL ME THE COMPUTER DOESN'T SHOW ANY TROUBLE CODES SO THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO. ALSO ON OCCASION THE IGNITION KEY IS HOT TO THE TOUCH. NOW I HAVE TO TAKE IT IN AGAIN BECAUSE THE BRAKE PETAL MIGHT FALL OFF. WHAT A GREAT PRODUCT...GM I THINK BUILDS A LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS IN TO SAVE MONEY WITHOUT A CARE FOR THE CUSTOMER. NOW I HAVE TO DRIVE A $46,000 PIECE OF CRAP THATS BROKEN. OUR HANDS ARE TIED AND AT THE MERCY OF BIG BUSINESS.   HOPE YOU CAN HELP.    STEVE",
