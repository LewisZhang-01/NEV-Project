I HAVE READ THE COMPLAINTS WITH THIS ENGINE AND AM SCARED TO FIX ANYTHING. THIS SLUDGE PROBLEM I READ ABOUT COULD BE NEXT FOR US. AND FROM WHAT I READ WILL BE. I PURCHASED IT FOR MY SON AND NEVER HERD OF THESE PROBLEMS UNTIL NOW. HE HAS HAD IT FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS AND NOW THIS. WE HAVE HARDSHIPS JUST LIKE ANY OTHER FAMILY AND FIXING MINOR PROBLEMS WITH VEHICLES ARE BAD ENOUGH. THE FIX FOR THIS IS ABOUT 1000.00 WILL THE SLUDGE BE NEXT?  I WOULD LIKE TO BE APART OF ANY LAW SUIT. *TR",
