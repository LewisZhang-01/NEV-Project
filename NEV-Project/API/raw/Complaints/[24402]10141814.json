        "summary": "HERE'S WHAT I SUBMITTED TO THE DODGE WEBSITE:  LAST NIGHT I RETURNED FROM MY DODGE DEALERSHIP AFTER HAVING NEW BRAKE PADS AND NEW ROTORS INSTALLED. THE VEHICLE IS DRIVING FINE AND THE BRAKES ARE OPERATING PERFECTLY. THE ASSISTANT SERVICE MANAGER, WES, WAS HELPFUL AND PROFESSIONAL.  HOWEVER, I DON'T THINK SPENDING $900 ON NEW ROTORS SHOULD BE REQUIRED AFTER TWO YEARS OF OPERATION AND LESS THAN 50,000 MILES. I AM METICULOUS ABOUT MAINTENANCE AND TIRE ROTATION. I DO NOT RIDE THE TRUCK HARD AND ALL OF MY DRIVING IS COUNTRY, NOT CITY, MILEAGE.  EVEN YOUR DODGE PERSONNEL COULD NOT GIVE ME ANY REASON WHY THIS WOULD HAPPEN SO SOON. I AM NOT A CERTIFIED MECHANIC, BUT I BELIEVE THERE IS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG WITH EITHER THE DESIGN OF THE BRAKES OR THE MATERIALS OR COMPONENTS USED IN THE BRAKE DESIGN.    I BOUGHT A NEW '91 DODGE DAYTONA AND SAID I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER DODGE DUE TO PROBLEMS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS. IN 2003, I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE DODGE ANOTHER SHOT AND BOUGHT A NEW LOADED, DAKOTA TRUCK. REST ASSURED, THIS WILL BE THE LAST DODGE VEHICLE I EVER OWN.  SINCERELY,  WILLIAM WILSON.  *JB",
