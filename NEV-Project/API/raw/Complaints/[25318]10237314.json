I SEE THE INTERIOR START TO FILL UP WITH SMOKE.  I THOUGHT IT WAS AN ENGINE FIRE AT FIRST UNTIL I NOTICED A FIRE IN MY PASSENGER DOOR SPEAKER.  I PULLED OVER BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO EXTINGUISH THE FLAMES.  I MADE A CALL TO 911 TO SEND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.  THANKFULLY THE FIRE HOUSE WAS VERY CLOSE AND WAS ABLE TO PUT THE FIRE OUT BEFORE IT DAMAGED MORE THAN JUST THE DOOR.  I HAVE THE DOOR AND SUBSEQUENT DAMAGE SCHEDULED TO BE REPAIRED AUG 18TH 2008.  I HAVE NOT TAKEN APART, REPLACED, OR UPGRADED ANY DASH, RADIO OR ELECTRICAL COMPONENT OF THE CAR.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED THIS.    ADDITIONALLY I AM ALSO MISSING THE HEAT AND A/C KNOB AS IT BROKE OFF LAST WINTER.  *TR",
