        "summary": "THERE HAVE BEEN MANY PROBLEMS WITH MY 1998 FORD ESCORT SINCE I PURCHASED IT NEW IN AUGUST, 1998.  THE MOST SEVERE AND RECENT PROBLEM WAS REPAIRED IN DECEMBER, 2002.  THE HEAD GASKET BLEW, CAUSING MAJOR OVERHEATING PROBLEMS IN MY VEHICLE.  THE VEHICLE HAD LESS THAN 40,000 MILES.  I AM NOT CERTAIN IF THE HEAD GASKET BECAME FAULTY WHILE VEHICLE WAS BEING BUILT, OR IF FULLERTON FORD DAMAGED THE GASKET WHILE DOING WORK ON MY VEHICLE, AND THEN ATTEMPTED TO SODDER THE PART TOGETHER.  ACCORDING TO CORBO'S AUTO SERVICE IN SOMERVILLE, THE GASKET HAD A \"SODDERED\" HOLE IN IT WHICH CAUSED THE GASKET TO BLOW.   FULLERTON FORM WAS THE ONLY REPAIR FACILITY I HAD TAKEN MY VEHICLE TO BE REPAIRED BEFORE IT WAS TAKEN TO CORBO'S.  I HAVE CALLED FORD ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE SERVICE WORK AT FULLERTON.  I HAVE EXPRESSED TO THEM THAT I BELIEVE FULLERTON FORD WAS HURTING MY VEHICLE MORE THAN IT WAS HELPING IT.  THE FORD COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE IN MY EFFORTS TO INVESTIGATE FULLERTON FORDS SERVICE PRACTICES.",
