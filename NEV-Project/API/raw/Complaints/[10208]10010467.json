        "summary": "MY 1998 FORD CONTOUR 4-DOOR SEDAN RECENTLY EXPERIENCED A DEVASTATING FAILURE.  WHILE MY DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING THROUGH A PARKING LOT AT LOW SPEED, A SUB-FRAME ASSEMBLY UNDER THE DASH FELL DOWN ON HER FEET.  THE ASSEMBLY IS HELD IN PLACE WITH TWO BOLTS WHICH HAD COME LOOSE.  AS A RESULT OF THIS, THE STEERING LINKAGE WAS ALLOWED TO DISCONNECT, PERMITTING THE STEERING WHEEL TO SPIN FREELY.  HAD THIS HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY SHE WOULD HAVE COMPLETELY LOSS CONTROL, AND BECAUSE THE FRAME FELL ON HER FEET, SHE PROBABLY COULDN'T HAVE APPLIED THE BRAKE.  NO STEERING AND NO BRAKE!  I THINK THIS IS A POTENTIALLY FATAL DESIGN DEFECT.  OF COURSE, THE DEALER AND FORD APOLOGIZED BUT REFUSED TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  *JB",
