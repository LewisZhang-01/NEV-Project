COMING FROM A COMPLETE STOP CAR FAILS TO ACCELERATE UNTIL PRESSING THE PEDAL TO THE FLOOR FOR 5 SECONDS AND CAUSES SEVERE SAFETY CONCERNS WHEN MERGING INTO TRAFFIC. IT IS AS IF CAR IS STALLING OR SOMETHING IS SLIPPING. ALSO SOMETIMES WHEN SHIFTING CAR WILL STAY IN HIGH RPMS AND STICK THERE EVEN WHEN NOT ACCELERATING. NOTICEABLY MORE FOR BOTH ISSUES DURING HOTTER MONTHS. THIS HAS ALMOST CAUSED NUMEROUS WRECKS AND SEVERE SAFETY CONCERNS AS I DRIVE WITH AN INFANT IN MY CAR. THERE ARE 1,000S OF COMPLAINTS ONLINE WITH THIS SAME ISSUE AND VEHICLE. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE ONE OF US IS KILLED.",
