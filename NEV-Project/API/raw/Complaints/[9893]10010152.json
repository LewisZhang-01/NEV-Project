THE EVENING OF MARCH 3 THE TRUCK BEGAN TO RUN WEIRD AND IT BEGAN TO NOT RUN CORRECTLY.THE MORNING AFTER I BROUGHT IT TO A REAIR GARAGE AND THE COMPUTER SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A DETINATION IN THE MOTOR. THE IGNITION COIL WAS BAD THE MECHANIC INFORMED ME THAT HE NEEDED TO REPLACE ALL EIGHT COILS. THIS COST ME 905 DOLLARS. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS PROBLEM SHOULD HAVE OCCURED BECAUSE IT HAS LOWER MLES. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THIS IS AN OCCURING PROBLEM WITH THE 5.4 TRITON V8. I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THE MONEY THAT I HAD TO PUT INTO MY TRUCK, I BOUGHT A NEWER VEHICLE TO WAIVE SOME COST OF VEHICLE REPAIRS BUT THIS WAS A REDICULOUS AMOUNT FOR A REPAIR.",
