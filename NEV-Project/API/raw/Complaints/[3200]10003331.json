I HAVE CARRIED THE VEHICLE TO TWO DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS MORE THAN SIX TIMES.  THE PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE HAVE NOT YET BEEN REPAIRED.  I FEEL THAT THIS VEHICLE IS UNSAFE AND A LIABILITY TO OTHERS AND MYSELF WHILE IT IS ON THE ROADS.     SOME OF THE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT THE VEHICLE HAS HAD, BUT HAVE BEEN CORRECTED ARE  1. KEYS WOULD NOT OPEN TRUNK  2. DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR WOULD MALFUNCTION AND LOCK ITSELF.  MANUAL RELEASE OF THE LOCK COULD ONLY OCCUR FROM OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE, RESULTING IN MYSELF HAVE TO CLIMB OUT THE PASSENGER'S SIDE DOOR TO EXIT THE VEHICLE.",
