AGAIN IN APRIL, 2003, AT 53,300 MILES, LOCAL DEALER SAYS MOTOR IS DEFECTIVE AND NEEDS TO REPLACED AT COST OF $420.  ATTITUDE OF DEALER AND CADILLAC CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THAT \"STUFF HAPPENS\".  MY BELIEF IS THIS FAILURE RATE INDICATES PROBLEM WITH QUALITY OF FAN MOTOR OR PROBLEM WITH MOTOR ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT.   *JB",
