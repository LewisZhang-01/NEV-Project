I USUALLY GET FREE BRAKE INSPECTION WHEN I GET OIL CHANGED.  NOW BRAKES SOUND BAD.  TOOK TO AUTO REPAIR SHOP AND WAS TOLD THAT THE CALIPERS WERE LOCKED UP.  BRAKE PADS ARE BAD (WORN ON THE INSIDE ONLY) ON THE \"RIGHT\" FRONT WHEEL ONLY.  ALSO THE ROTOR ON THE RIGHT FRONT NEEDS REPLACEMENT.  I CALLED THE MANUFACTURER. AND WAS TOLD THAT THE CALIPER WAS STILL COVERED UNDER MY WARRANTY.  I WAS TOLD TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER.  TOOK IT TO MY LOCAL CLARKSVILLE IN DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT THE CALIPER WAS OK.  THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT MY BRAKES WERE BAD AND I NEED NEW ROTOR.  I TOOK THE AUTO ON FRIDAY. AND THE REPAIRMAN LOOKED AT IT ON MONDAY.  HE ADVISED ME THAT HE DID NOT NEED TO TEST DRIVE IT BECAUSE THE CALIPER WAS NOT LOCKED UP \"NOW\".  DEALER REFUSE TO FIX BRAKES UNDER WARRANTY BUT WOULD INSTALL NEW BRAKES AND ROTOR AT MY COST.  I TOLD DEALER TO \"DO NOTHING\" I WILL PICK AUTO UP.  WHEN I GOT TO DEALER THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY INSTALLED NEW PADS AT NO COST BECAUSE AUTO WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE.  DEALER REFUSED TO GIVE ME OLD PADS.  THE REPAIR SHOP I ORIGINALLY TOOK IT TO KEN TOWERY TOLD ME THAT WHEN THE CALIPER LOCKS UP IT CAN CAUSE THE PADS AND ROTOR TO GO BAD.  AND SINCE HE SAW THAT THE INSIDE OF THE PAD ON THE RIGHT FRONT WAS ONLY WORN ON THE INSIDE INDICATED THAT THIS IS MORE THAN LIKELY WHAT HAPPENED.     *NLM",
