WHEN TOYOTA DEALERSHIP PULLED THE WHEELS OFF THE TRUCK AND CHECKED THE BRAKES THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE WEAR ON THE FRONT RIGHT BREAK PADS THEN THE LEFT SIDE.  I HAD THE BREAKS REPLACED AND KEPT THE WORN OUT BRAKES FOR YOUR INSPECTION.  IT APPEARS THE RIGHT-SIDE CALIPER FAILED MAKING IT HARD TO STEER AND CAUSING THE BRAKES ON THE RIGHT SIDE TO WEAR OUT IN LESS THAN 15,000 MILES.  TOYOTA SAYS THIS IS NORMAL EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD.   *NLM",
