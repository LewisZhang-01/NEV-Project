THERE IS NO WAY THAT THESE DEFECTIVE PARTS HAVE NOT EFFECTED THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS VEHICLE AND ULTIMATELY CAUSED EXTRA WEAR AND TEAR ON OTHER VEHICLE PARTS. ON TOP OF IT ALL I AM GETTING NO COOPERATION FROM MY TOYOTA DEALERSHIP OR TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE. I HAVE REQUESTED A FULL DIAGNOSTIC TEST BE PERFORMED ON MY VEHICLE AND THAT ANY AND ALL PROBLEMS BE FIXED, I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT FUTURE PROBLEMS CANNOT BE PREDICTED AND I UNDERSTAND THAT, HOWEVER THE CONSUMER SHOULD NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCOMPETENCE OF A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR CORPORATION SUCH AS TOYOTA.*JB",
