THIS CREATES A SAFETY ISSUE WITH OTHER DRIVERS BEHIND YOU TAILGATING, PASSING YOU IN ROAD RAGE TYPE MANNERS AND CREATES AN OVERALL SAFETY ISSUE WHEN YOU ARE IMPEDING TRAFFIC AND DON'T KNOW IF YOUR DRIVING THE LEGAL SPEED LIMIT. FURTHER MORE THE ODOMETER READING IS FALSIFIED BECAUSE OF THIS. THIS PROBLEM IS WELL DOCUMENTED WITH ALL OWNERS OF HONDA VTX MOTORCYCLES, AFTERMARKET COMPANIES ARE MAKING MONEY PROVIDING A REPAIR SOLUTION BECAUSE THE DEALER CHOOSES TO IGNORE THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM AND TELLS THE CONSUMER THAT THE PROBLEM IS NORMAL. THE FACT THAT AN AFTERMARKET PART CALLED THE SPEEDO HEALER EXISTS SHOULD BE PROOF ENOUGH THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM. THE DEALER SHOULD PROVIDE THE FIX FOR FREE, I SHOULDN'T NEED TO RELY ON AN AFTERMARKET COMPANY TO PROVIDE ACCURACY ON AN IMPORTANT ITEM SUCH AS MY SPEEDOMETER. *TR",
