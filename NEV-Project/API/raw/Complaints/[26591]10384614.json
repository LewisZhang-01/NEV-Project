        "summary": "I HAVE A 2002 MAZDA PROTEGE.  WERE THE UPPER PASSENGER SIDE MOTOR MOUNT ATTACHES TO THE CAR BODY, THE CAR BODY METAL IS SEVERELY RUSTED AND STARTING TO SEPARATE ON THE INSIDE OF THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  I DID TAKE THE CAR TO A MAZDA BODY SHOP AND THEY QUOTED ME IN THE AREA OF $1,000.00 TO FIX THE ISSUE.  I DO NOT FEEL IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY FOR THE FIX AS THIS IS AN AREA HIGH IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT NOT SUBJECT TO THE ELEMENTS.  BASICALLY MAZDA HAS SOME PROBLEM WITH THE METAL, THE ANTI CORROSION TREATMENT OR THE FINISH TREATMENT TO THE METAL.  THIS IS IN A PROTECTED AREA AND IF PROPERLY MADE SHOULD NEVER RUST.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, A GOOD SOLID MOTOR MOUNT IS A CRITICAL ITEM.  I FIRST NOTICED THIS PROBLEM ABOUT JUNE 1ST 2010.  *TR",
