        "summary": "THE MOTORCYCLE AND MANY OF THE SAME MODELS HAVE A HEAT ISSUE. THE BIKE DOES NOT OVER HEAT, BUT IT OVER HEATS THE DRIVER. IN 85 DEGREE WEATHER, THE HEAT COMING FROM THE ENGINE VENTS IS UNBEARABE. IT HEATS THE DRIVER FROM THE SHINS TO THE CROTCH. WHEN THIS FIRST HAPPENED, I EXPECTD TO PULL DOWN MY PANTS AND HAVE BURNS ON MY LEGS AND CROTCH AREA. I TOOK THE BIKE TO MY DEALER AND THEY AGREE WITH ME, THEY CALLED HONDA AND HONDA SAYS THEY ARE NOT DOING ANY THING ABOUT IT. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE MAJOR MOTOCYCLE MAGAZINES,A ND IS ALL OVER THE ST1300 WEBSITES, SEVERAL PEOPLE ON THE SITES HAVE SOLD THEIR MOTORCYCLES BECAUSE OF IT...I LOVE THE BIKE, OTHER THAN THIS PROBLEM...AT MY DELAER,THEY PUT A LAZER HEAT GUN ON IT SITTING AT IDLE. THE TANK WAS 110 DEGREES, HOT ENOUGHT YOU COULD NOT HOLD YOUR HAND ON IT. THE HEAT COMING OUT OF THE VENTS OF THE ENGINE RIGHT IN THE LEG AREA OF THE RIDER WAS 147 DEGREES, GOING UP T 187 DEGREES WHEN THE FAN KICKED ON....THIS IS ALOT OF HEAT TO BE BLOWIG RIGHT ON YOUR LEGS AND CROTCH.....HONDA DID PUT RETRO FIT HEAT SHIELDS ON THE BIKES WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT, BUT THERE IS STILL A HEATPROBLEM....",
