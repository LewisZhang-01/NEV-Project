LOST SEVERAL HOURS AT WORK AND WAS GIVEN SUBSTANDARD RENTAL CAR, REPAIR WAS NOT COMPLETED ON THE DAY ESTIMATED. PER AUDI OF AMERICA POLICY, ONLY ONE COIL IS REPLACED, WE WILL WAIT FOR ANOTHER COIL TO PROVE FAULTY (WHICH ALMOST EVERYONE ASSUMES WILL HAPPEN, EVEN DEALER), I WILL HAVE TO WAIT AT ROAD SIDE AGAIN, AT WHICH POINT AUDI WILL REPLACE ALL REMAINING COILS. (HOPEFULLY--AUDI'S WEB SITE ALREADY HAS SAID ALL WOULD BE REPLACED WHEN ONE FAILS, BEGINNING IN MARCH, BUT APPARENTLY THIS IS NOT THE POLICY AT MY DEALER.) THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING TO THOUSANDS OF AUDI CUSTOMERS.  *JB",
