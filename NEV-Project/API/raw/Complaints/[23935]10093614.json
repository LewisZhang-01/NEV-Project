        "summary": "MY 1999 PONTIAC BONNEVILLE EXPLODED WHEN THE KEY WAS TURNED IN THE IGNITION & FIRE SHOT OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD.  WHEN THE KEY WAS TURNED OFF, THE FIRE STOPPED.  I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A PRIVATE MECHANIC WHO REPLACED THE A FUEL INJECTER & UPPER INTAKE PLENUM (WHICH WAS IN PIECES FROM THE EXPLOSION).  MY BILL WAS $430.63.  IN JUNE 2004, I RECEIVED A RECALL LETTER FROM GM CORPORATION SAYING THERE WAS A SAFETY ISSUE WITH FUEL PRESSURE REGULATOR DIAPHRAGMS LEAKING.  THE LETTER DESCRIBED THE FOLLOWING:  \"A LEAK CAN ALLOW FUEL TO ENTER THE INTAKE MANIFOLD THROUGH A VACUUM LINE.  IN LOW BATTERY CONDITIONS, IF THE ENGINE DOES NOT START WHEN CRANKED, THE FUEL FROM THE LEAKING REGULATOR AND A  SPARK CAN CAUSE A BACK FIRE.  THE BACK FIRE CAN RUPTURE THE INTAKE MANIFOLD, CAUSING A LOUD BANG.  THE RUPTURE OF THE INTAKE MANIFOLD CAN DISPLACE A FUEL LINE, PULLING AN INJECTOR OUT OF PLACE, AND CAUSING A FUEL LEAK.  IF THERE IS AN IGNITION SOURCE, A FIRE CAN RESULT.\"  THIS LETTER DESCRIBED EXACTLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED .  THE LIGHTS HAD BEEN LEFT ON IN MY PONTIAC WHICH CAUSED A DEAD BATTERY.  A BATTERY CHARGER WAS CONNECTED TO THE VEHICLE WHEN THE EXPLOSION HAPPENED.   WHEN WE TRIED TO START THE CAR AGAIN, THE FIRE STARTED AGAIN WHERE THE INTAKE MANIFOLD WAS LOCATED.  I MADE A REQUEST FOR REIMBURSEMENT TO GM.  MY FILE # IS 1-260698900.   I WAS ASKED TO TAKE MY CAR TO A DEALER IN SALISBURY FOR AN INSPECTION.  WHEN I TOOK THE CAR IN ON SEPT. 29, 2004, THE FUEL PRESSURE REGULATOR WAS REPLACED.   ACCORDING TO THE RECALL LETTER, AN INSPECTION WILL BE MADE AND, IF NECESSARY, THE REGULATOR WILL BE REPLACED.   SO THE RECALL CONDITION WAS FIXED BY THIS REPLACEMENT.  GM REFUSES TO REIMBURSE ME FOR MY REPAIR SAYING I HAVE NO PROOF THE RECALL CONDITION CAUSED THE EXPLOSION.  I WAS GIVEN NO RECOURSE TO DISPUTE THEIR DECISION.   THE CONDITION DESCRIBED IN THE SAFETY RECALL LETTER WAS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO MY VEHICLE IN FEBRUARY.   HELP.*AK",
