I KNOW THAT THE 1997 MODEL WAS RECALLED FOR THE SAME MALFUNCTION.  I AM THE MOTHER OF THREE CHILDREN AND SAFETY IS MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE WHEN I PURCHASE A CAR.  UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY AND A VERY EXPENSIVE PART TO REPLACE.  I DO NOT FEEL THIS SHOULD GO OUT AT ONLY 94,000 MILES.   *NLM",
