        "summary": "I HAVE A KNOCK IN MY ENGINE APPEARING TO BE COMING FROM THE NUMBER 1 PISTON AND CYLINDER AREA.  ONE DEALER CALLS IT PISTON SLAP, WHICH I HAVE READ UP ON AND IT SAYS THAT IT GOES AWAY AFTER IT WARMS UP, MY KNOCK CAN BE HEARD AT ALL TIMES OF ENGINE OPERATION.  GM SAYS THERE ARE TEFLON COATED PISTONS AVAILABLE ONLY FOR THE CORVETTE LS1 ENGINE AND NOT MY TRANS AM LS1 ENGINE.  I HAVE DEALT WITH ONE DEALER IN OAK HARBOR WA THAT IS BOTH A CHEVY AND PONTIAC SERVICE CENTER.  I REFUSE TO USE THIS DEALER EVER AGAIN BECAUSE THEY TRY TO PAWN IT OFF AS PISTON SLAP AND THAT IT IS NORMAL TO HAVE.  I HAVE A HIGH PERFORMANCE ENGINE I SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY KNOCKS IN IT, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT IS WORSENING AND I AM ABLE TO FEEL THE KNOCK THROUGH THE GEAR SHIFT HANDLE.  THE NEXT CLOSEST GM DEALER IS IN ANACORTES WA AND IT IS NOT A PONTIAC SO PONTIAC CUSTOMER SERVICE WANTS ME TO ONLY GO TO A PONTIAC DEALER WHICH THE NEXT CLOSEST DEALER IS ANOTHER 15 MILES AWAY.  WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT THE KNOCK IN MY ENGINE?  I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GET THE ENGINE REPLACED DUE TO THE DEPRECIATION VALUE OF MY CAR SINCE IT WILL BE A COLLECTORS ITEM BEING THE LAST MODEL MADE.   *JB",
