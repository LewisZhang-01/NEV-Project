THE FAILURE WAS REPAIRED AT COURTESY FORD IN SYRACUSE AT A COST OF 549.21. THE REASON I WAS GIVEN FOR THE FAILURE WAS ROT. I WAS ABOUT TO ENTER AN INTERSTATE AND HAD THIS FAILURE OCCURRED THEN IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A FATAL ACCIDENT. SINCE THIS IS A ITEM THAT IS CRUCIAL TO SAFETY I FEEL THAT THIS ITEM SHOULD NOT HAVE FAILED. ALSO, WHEN BEING REPAIRED, THE DRIVER SIDE BRACKET WAS ALSO REPAIRED AS IT WAS ABOUT TO FAIL ALSO.   *NLM",
