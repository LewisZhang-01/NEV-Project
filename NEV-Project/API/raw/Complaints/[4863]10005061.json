THIS LASTED UNTIL MY WARRANTY EXPIRED AND THEN I WAS TOLD I NEEDED A NEW ENGINE.  I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE BBB (#CHV0230345) AND IT WAS ACCEPTED FOR ARBITRATION BUT THE MANUFACTURER NEVER CONTACTED ME AS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO AND I CAN NOT GET A RESPONSE. I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE THE MOTOR AND THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER TWICE AND NOW THE CAR WILL NOT EVEN START.  I ALWAYS TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP SO THAT IT WOULD BE PROPERLY SERVICED, AND I AM VERY UPSET AND AM PLANNING ON SEEKING REIMBURSEMENT, COMPENSATION AND A VEHICLE THAT WORKS.  I SEE THAT THERE WERE MANY BULLETINS SENT OUT REGARDING THE SAME ISSUES AND HAVE SPOKEN TO OTHER 1997 CAMARO OWNERS WHO ARE ALSO VERY UPSET AND HAVE THE SAME ISSUES, AND WE ARE SEEKING TO FILE A CLASS ACTION SUIT.
