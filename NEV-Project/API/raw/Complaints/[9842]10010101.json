HIGH PEDAL EFFORT IS REQUIRED TO OVER COME THIS CONDITION BUT THIS PRACTICE IS UNSAFE BECAUSE THE RESULT IS A RAPID ACCELERATION OR LURCH WHEN THE PEDAL BECOMES UNSTUCK .      PROBLEM IS CHRONIC AS IT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED AT LEAST ANNUALLY BY CLEANING THE INTERNALS OF THROTTLE BODY.  THE CLEANING IS SUCCESSFUL IN REMOVING THE PROBLEM INITIALLY, BUT THE CONDITION ALWAYS RECURS AFTER ABOUT A YEAR (10,000 MILES) OF DRIVING.      ALTHOUGH CLEANING THE THROTTLE BODY ON A REGULAR BASIS IS A RECOMMENDED MAINTENANCE ITEM. *JB",
