AFTER A COUPLE WEEKS THE STEERING COLUMN BECAME VERY LOOSE AND CAUSED THE STEERING WHEEL TO WOBBLE. WHEN TURNING THE WHEEL I WOULD NOTICE A SEVERE GRINDING SOUND. UPON DETAILED ONLINE RESEARCH THE SAME OCCURRENCE HAS HAPPENED TO SEVERAL 2006 NISSAN PATHFINDER OWNERS WITH SIMILAR MILEAGE. AFTER TAKING MY CAR TO THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION WE HAVE FOUND THAT NISSAN HAS ISSUED A SERVICE PART TO CORRECT THIS ISSUE. MY REPAIR WILL COST AN UPWARD OF $1300.  I FEEL THAT NISSAN SHOULD MAKE THIS ISSUE A RECALL AS THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT IF I CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE CAR THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD LOCK UP AND POTENTIALLY CAUSE A HAZARDOUS ACCIDENT!! THIS IS A SEVERE ISSUE FOR MYSELF AND OTHERS.  *TR",
