THIS SHUDDER HAPPENS 90% OF THE TIME WHEN ACCELERATING, AND IS GETTING WORSE. CLUTCHES WERE REPLACED NOT LONG AFTER WE BOUGHT IT (BOUGHT USED FROM DEALER IN 2016), AND WE WERE TOLD BY THE DEALER IN 2018 THAT THE CLUTCHES NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AGAIN, AND SINCE THEY WERE 2 MONTHS OUT OF WARRANTY, WE WOULD HAVE TO COUGH UP THE $1800 OURSELVES TO REPLACE THE CLUTCHES FOR THE SECOND TIME IN A CAR THAT WAS THEN 4 YEARS OLD.",
