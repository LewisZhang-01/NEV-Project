LAST NIGHT WHEN WE PUT OUR SON INTO THE SEAT, WE COULDN'T CLOSE THE CHEST HARNESS PROPERLY, AS THE RELEASE BUTTON HAD JUST BROKEN OFF.  THIS IS VERY DISTURBING, AS THE CAR SEAT WAS RENDERED USELESS DURING AN OUTING.  THIS HARNESS IS ALSO THE ONLY THING THAT HOLDS OUR SON INTO THE SEAT.  HAD IT NOT BROKEN OFF LIKE IT DID, WE WOULD NEVER HAVE KNOWN THAT THE UNIT WAS DEFECTIVE; AND OUR SON COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT.    *NLM",
