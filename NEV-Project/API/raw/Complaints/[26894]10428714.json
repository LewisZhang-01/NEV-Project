THERE ARE 4 PAGES OF COMPLAINTS DETAILING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE SAME VEHICLE. PERHAPS FORD HAS AVOIDED A RECALL BY STATING THIS DOES NOT EFFECT SAFETY OR EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, I GOT MY FIRST SPEEDING TICKET IN OVER A DECADE 2 DAYS AFTER THIS PROBLEM BEGAN. SPEED CONTROL DOES EFFECT SAFETY, AND APPARENTLY, IF GONE WITHOUT REPAIR, THE NON-WORKING SPEEDOMETER EFFECTS THE TRANSMISSIONS ABILITY TO SHIFT PROPERLY, WHICH IS ALSO A SAFETY HAZARD.  I DO NOT HAVE $950 TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM, NOR CAN I AFFORD TO PAY THE COSTS OF SPEEDING TICKET FINES, AND THE RISE IN MY COST OF AUTO INSURANCE DUE TO THESE FINES. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS PROBLEM, AS IT APPEARS TO BE A RECURRENT ISSUE WITH THIS VEHICLE THAT FORD SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR.   *TR",
