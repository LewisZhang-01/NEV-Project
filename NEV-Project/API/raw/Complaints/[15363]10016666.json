HOWEVER, WE HAVE TO CLEAN THE FRONT WHEELS CONSTANTLY BECAUSE THEY ARE BLACK WITH HEAVY DUST WITHIN ONE WEEK OF WASHING.  WE HAVE NOTICED OTHER NEW VEHICLES DO NOT APPEAR TO GET AS MUCH BRAKE DUST IN A SHORT TIME PERIOD.  WE ARE WONDERING IF LARGE AMOUNTS OF BRAKE DUST IS A NORMAL OCCURRENCE OR IF THERE IS A DEFECT IN THE BRAKING SYSTEM.    *NLM",
