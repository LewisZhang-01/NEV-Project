MY MECHANIC SAID THAT BEHIND THE BRAKES, THERE IS A HOSE THAT NEEDS TO BE PURGED, BUT EVERY TIME THEY TRY TO DO THAT, IT DOES NOT WORK. THERE IS NO FLEXIBILITY ON THE HOSE. WE'VE ATTEMPTED FIXING THIS SEVERAL TIMES AND IT WORKS FOR A DAY AND THEN THE NEXT DAY IT DOES NOT WORK.  PLEASE LET US KNOW IF THERE IS A WAY WE CAN FIX THIS. I'M AFRAID THIS ISSUES HAS ENDANGERED MY LIFE SEVERAL TIMES. I CANNOT DRIVE IT ANYMORE, BUT I ONLY HAVE THIS CAR. THE LATEST ISSUE WAS TODAY. AFTER HAVING IT AT THE SHOP FOR OVER A WEEK, I WAS DRIVING MY CAR OUT OF THE MY DRIVE WAY AND THE BRAKE WOULD NOT WORK. I'VE PARKED IT OUTSIDE MY HOME.THANK YOU,  *TR",
