UPON INSPECTION IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE RECALL WAS CORRECTED WITH A DEFECTIVE PART. THE RECALL PROBLEM WHICH WAS SUPPOSEDLY FIXED WAS CORRECTED WITH A DEFECTIVE PART WHICH CAUSED AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS DRIVING SITUATION. OUR TEENAGE DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING AT THE TIME WHEN ALL THE WARNING LIGHTS WENT ONE. OBVIOUSLY THIS RECALL WAS NOT CORRECTED AND IF INFINITI BELIEVES IT WAS, THEY ARE WRONG. HOW CAN A DEFECTIVE PART BE USED FOR A RECALL?",
