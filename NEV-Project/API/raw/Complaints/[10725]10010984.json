WHILE DRIVING IN A MOUNTANOUS AREA WITH CURVES(ASPHALTED ROAD), AFTER A CURVE AT APPROXIMATELY 10-20 MPH, I FELT THE TRUCK LOST THE RIGHT SIDE FRONT TIRE, WHEN I CHECKED I HAD LOST THE PART OF THE FRONT SUSPENSION THAT HOLDS THE DISC, CALIPER BEARING, TIRE, BALL JOINTS AND ALL OTHER RELATED PARTS.  I RECOVERED THE ASSEMBLY THAT INCLUDED THE ABOVE PARTS. I TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE CHRYSLER DEALER, THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD TO WAIT FOR A CHRYSLER ENGINEER TO DETERMINE IF IT WAS A DEFECT( THE CAR WAS BRAND NEW AND HAD ABOUT 1700 MILES AND THREE WEEKS OLD).  THE ENGINEER ARRIVED TO PUERTO RICO LAST THURSDAY MARCH 20 2003, AND IN A COUPLE OF HOURS (2-3 HOURS) DETERMINED THAT IT WAS ALL AN ACCIDENT( I AM A MECHANICAL ENGINEER).  I ASKED FOR THIS INFORMATION IN WRITING- I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT).  SINCE THE FIRST WEEK I HAD THE RAM, I FELT A NOISE THAT REALLY SOUNDED LIKE A LOOSE PART UNDER THE DASH, OTHER THAN THAT I DID NOT FEEL ANYTHING ABNORMAL IN THE DRIVING CHARACTERISTICS, I HAD SPOKE WITH THE SALESMAN AND ASKED HIM ABOUT THE WARRANTY PROCEDURE, TO TAKE THE RAM IN FOR THIS NOISE.",
