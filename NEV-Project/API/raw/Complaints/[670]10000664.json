THE CAR HAD LESS THAN 1000 MILES ON IT AND HAD TO BE TOWED AWAY. I HAD TO LEAVE THE CAR, GET A RENTAL (WHICH WAS PAID FOR), AND WAS TOLD IT WAS THE FUEL PUMP, WHICH THE DEALER STATED THEY HAD NEVER HAD HAPPEN BEFORE.  I TOLD THE DEALER I WAS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT CAR, BUT WAS TOLD THIS WAS A UNHEARD OF PROBLEM.",
