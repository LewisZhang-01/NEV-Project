TOOK TO SUBURBAN CHRYSLER (SAINT PAUL), WHERE I WAS TOLD THIS IS NORMAL OPERATION.  I AGREE THE ENGINE SHOULD HAVE A REV LIMITER IF THE TRANSMISSION DOESN'T SHIFT (MY COMPLAINT).  NOT ONLY DID SUBURBAN CHRYSLER (SAINT PAUL) WASTE A WHOLE DAY OF HAVING MY DURANGO, THEY USED A HALF A TANK A GAS AND PUT OVER A HUNDRED MILES ON IT JUST TO TELL ME \"THERE IS NO PROBLEM.\"  EVERY CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED HAD AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION (AND I HAVE WORKED ON A FEW MYSELF), AND HAVE NEVER FAILED TO SHIFT AT REDLINE (THOSE CARS HAD 100 TIMES THE MILEAGE, THAT  MY DURANGO HAS).    WHEN I PICKED UP MY DURANGO NOT ONLY WAS I PISSED THEY USED IT ALL DAY AND COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT, THEY DIDN'T EVEN SHUT THE HOOD ALL THE WAY WHEN THEY WERE DONE. I HAD TO PULL OVER ON THE FREEWAY TO CLOSE THE HOOD PROPERLY (IT WAS BOUNCING ON THE SAFETY CATCH).  I COMPLAINED TO CHRYSLER WHO TOLD ME TO VISIT ANOTHER DEALER.  THIS IS CERTAINLY 5 OUT OF 10 STAR SERVICE.",
