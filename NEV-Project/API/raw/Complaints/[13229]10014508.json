THE HOT WATER CAUSED A SCALDING THE LAST TIME THE SHOWER WAS USED.  THE FAUCET CONTROLS THE WATER BY A SIDE TO SIDE MOTION THAT IS ABOUT 1/2\" IN EITHER DIRECTION.  ONCE SET (EVEN TEMPERATURE) IT ONLY TAKES A SLIGHT MOVEMENT TO CHANGE THE TEMPERATURE. I KNOW THIS IS A MINOR COMPLAINT BUT A CORRECTION TO THE FAUCET REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE.  SCALDING IS NOT MINOR.  *JB",
