I HAVE TAKEN THIS PROBLEM IN TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT MY CALIPERS HAD TO BE REPLACED. I WAS VERY HAPPY THAT IT WAS STILL COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY. THE DEALER HAD MY VEHICLE FOR ABOUT A WEEK. WHEN I GOT MY VAN BACK IT WAS FINE FOR ABOUT 5 MONTHS, AND THEN THE PROBLEM STARTED HAPPENING AGAIN. NOW I AM STUCK WITH A VEHICLE THAT IS COSTING A FORTUNE TO KEEP UP THE BRAKE PAD MAINTENANCE. I CONSIDER THE BRAKES ON A VEHICLE A LIFELINE AND AM SURPRISED THAT THIS PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED. EVERY PERSON I KNOW THAT OWNS A DODGE CARAVAN HAS THE SAME COMPLAINT. I BOUGHT MY VAN 01/01/00.  *NLM",
