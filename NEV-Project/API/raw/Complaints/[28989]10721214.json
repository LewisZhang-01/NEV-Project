        "summary": "I WAS WAITING AT A STOP LIGHT ON NORRISTOWN ROAD TO CROSS BETHLEHEM PIKE IN SPRINGHOUSE, PA AT APPROXIMATELY 5 PM ON 5/22/15.  I WAS FIRST IN LINE TO CROSS THE INTERSECTION IN THE DIRECTION OF PICKING UP 309 SOUTH IN ABOUT 1/2 MILE.  I HAD BEEN WAITING AT THE LIGHT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO WHEN MY CAR SURGED FORWARD.  I PUT BOTH FEET ON THE BRAKE BUT I WAS MOVING INTO THE INTERSECTION NONETHELESS.  THERE WAS SPARSE TRAFFIC AND IT WAS SAFE FOR ME TO TURN RIGHT ONTO BETHLETHEM PIKE.  ALMOST AS SOON AS I MADE THE TURN ONTO BETHLEHEM PIKE THE SURGE DISSIPATED AND THE ENGINE PERFORMANCE RETURNED TO NORMAL.  THE WHOLE INCIDENT TOOK ABOUT 30 SECONDS TO A MINUTE.  IT WAS PROBABLY ILL-ADVISED, BUT I CONTINUED TO DRIVE TO MY DESTINATION, HOME.  UPON REACHING HOME AND THINKING ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENNED I HAD THE CAR TOWED THE NEXT MORNING (YESTERDAY) TO A DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR. THE CAR AT THIS MOMENT IS THERE AWAITING REPAIR, I HAD TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF MILES ON THE ODOMETER.      ON THE FIRST LEG OF MY ERRAND ON THAT DAY (FRIDAY 5/22), I DROVE NORTH ON RT 309.  I NOTICED THAT AT FREEWAY SPEED THE TACHOMETER WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 3000 RPM.  I HAD DONE A LONG TRIP WITH THIS CAR THE PREVIOUS SUNDAY, 5/17, AND AT CRUISING SPEED THE TACHOMETER WAS IN THE VICINITY OF 2100 RPM.",
