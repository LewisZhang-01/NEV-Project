I THEN NOTICED THAT THE CAR WAS SITTING LOPSIDED ON THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE AND SINCE THEN THE CAR HAS BEEN MAKING CRUNCHING SOUNDS.  THE DASH LIGHTS ALSO WENT OUT ALONG W/THE HEATER.  IT NO LONGER BLOWS COLD AIR IT IS ALWAYS HOT AIR AND THE TEMPERATURE IS AT ITS LOWEST.  THIS ALL STARTED W/A VACUUM LEAK.  THE PASSENGER SIDE SEAT BELT ALSO RETRACTED SLOW AND NOW IT DOESN'T EVEN RETRACT.  THIS CAR SEEMS TO HAVE ONE PROBLEM AFTER ANOTHER AND ALL AT ONCE.  I BOUGHT THIS CAR FOR MY DAUGHTER CUZ I WANTED HER TO HAVE A SAFE VEHICLE TO DRIVE FOR COLLEGE, BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE TURNING OUT THAT WAY.  SHE IS NOW DRIVING MY CAR BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HER ON THE ROAD.  *TR",
