THE LOW OIL INDICATOR COMES ON AND WE NEED TO ADD ONE OR MORE QUARTS OF OIL AT EACH 3,000 TO 3,500 MILES. THE CAR DEALER TELLS US IT IS \"NORMAL\" FOR SOME CARS TO USE THIS AMOUNT OF OIL AND THE PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED. I NOTICED A RECALL NOTICETSB #TJ30021 COVERED SOME 2011 VOLVO XC 70S FOR OIL LOSS. WHY DOES IT NOT COVER THE 2010 CARS? THIS IS A CONTINUING PROBLEM WITH MY CAR. HAVE THERE BEEN OTHER COMPLAINTS SIMILAR TO MINE? I HAVE RECORDS FOR MY OIL CHANGES FROM THE CAR DEALERSHIP.",
