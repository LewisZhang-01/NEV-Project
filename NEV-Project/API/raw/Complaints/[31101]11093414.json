I RECENTLY ATTEMPTED RAPID ACCELERATION WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN TO AVOID A COLLISION WHERE AN ONCOMING DRIVER RAN A RED LIGHT.  THE ENGINE STALLED.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED OTHER SIMILAR INCIDENTS.  I HAVE REPORTED THIS TO MY TOYOTA SERVICE CENTER TWICE.  THE FIRST TIME I WAS TOLD TOYOTA IS AWARE OF THE CONDITION, WHICH WOULD BE ADDRESSED IN A SOFTWARE UPDATE.  THE SECOND TIME I WAS TOLD MY ENGINE WAS OPERATING WITHIN NORMAL SPECIFICATION PARAMETERS, AND NO SUCH SOFTWARE UPDATE WAS FORTHCOMING.  IT WAS RAINING THE DAY I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE, SO IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO TEST LOW END ACCELERATION.  I WOULD NEVER HAVE BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE HAD I KNOWN LOW END ACCELERATION WAS SO LETHARGIC.  ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS IT HAS NEARLY GOTTEN ME KILLED.",
