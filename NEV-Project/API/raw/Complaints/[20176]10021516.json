FOR AMERICAN HONDA. THE MEETING TOOK PLACE ON 3/24/03 AND I EXPLAINED THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH MY 2003 HYBRID AND MY 1998 ACCORD. THE PRIMARY CONCERN ABOUT THE ACCORD WAS THE RECALL OF ELECTRICAL PORTION OF THE IGNITION SWITCH. NORM REEVES HAD CLAIMED TO INSTALL A COMPLETE IGNITION SWITCH ON THE INSTRUCTIONS OF AMERICAN HONDA. AFTER THE ALLEGED REPAIR, THE VEHICLE CONTINUED TO STALL. I PROPOSED THE FOLLOWING: (1) I BUY THE NEW PART, (2) I WITNESS THE INSTALLATION, AND (3) I RECEIVE THE PART REMOVED. MR. CATHERINE PROMISED TO GET BACK TO ME \u001cIN A COUPLE OF DAYS.\u001d THIS NEVER HAPPENED. I BOUGHT A NEW PART FROM ANOTHER DEALER AND HAD IT INSTALLED BY AN INDEPENDENT HONDA MECHANIC ON 5/9/03. HIS OPINION WAS THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN DONE AND THAT THE PART REMOVED SHOWED WEAR UNLIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE SHORT INTERVAL. HE ALSO STATED THAT NORM REEVES COULD NOT HAVE REPLACED THE COMPLETE IGNITION, SINCE THAT TYPE OF REPAIR WOULD HAVE NECESSITATED THE RE-PROGRAMMING OF THE KEYS. FURTHER, HONDA\u0019S WRITTEN SERVICE BULLETIN 02-031 CLEARLY INSTRUCTS THE DEALER: \u001cCENTER-PUNCH A COMPLETION MARK ABOVE THE EIGHTH CHARACTER OF THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT VIN.\u001d NO SUCH MARK APPEARS ON MY VEHICLE. IN VIEW OF THE EVIDENCE, I NOW BELIEVE THAT HONDA HAS ENGAGED IN A FRAUDULENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RECALL ORDER. TO FURTHER PROVE THIS ALLEGATION, I SEEK THE ASSISTANCE OF NHTSA TO DETERMINE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HAND-WRITTEN NUMBERS ON THE ELECTRICAL SWITCH PART. I HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS OF BOTH THE ORIGINAL PART (35130-S84-A01) AND THE REPLACEMENT PART (35130-S84-305). FURTHER, I NOTE THAT THE RAISED PLASTIC NUMBERS ON THE PARTS DIFFER BY ONE DIGIT. I BELIEVE THAT NHTSA SHOULD ASCERTAIN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BOTH THE RAISED PLASTIC NUMBERS AND THE HAND-WRITTEN NUMBERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER A NEW INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE INITIATED.  *JB",
