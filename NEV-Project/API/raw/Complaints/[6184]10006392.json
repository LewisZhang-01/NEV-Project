        "summary": "MY MANUAL TRANSMISSION HAS A PROBLEM, THE CAR IS STILL DRIVABLE, BUT EVERY TIME I PUSH MY CLUTCH, MY SHIFTER MOVES  UP AND DOWN, FORWARD, OR BACKWARD AND SOMETIMES GOES OUT OF THE GEAR.  I THOUGHT THAT IT COULD BE A PROBLEM WITH ONE OF MY MOUNTS GOING BAD, BUT A MECHANIC CHECKED THEM AND SAID THEY WERE OK.  THEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE FAILURES OF TRANSMISSIONS BY OTHER CARS JUST LIKE MINE, SO IT'S PROBABLY A MANUFACTURER'S MISTAKE BECAUSE THERE ARE THE SO CALLED GETRAG 5 SPEED TRANSMISSIONS INSIDE MY CAR AND THEY ARE THE ONE'S SUPPOSEDLY TO GO BAD EASILY.  A REPLACEMENT WOULD COST ME A LOT OF MONEY WHICH I CAN'T COME UP WITH THAT EASY.  NOW THE WORST IS, I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE MY CAR, BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD IT AIN'T GOING TO BE LONGER THAN 2-3 MONTHS AND THEN MY TRANSMISSION WILL DIE COMPLETELY.     *JB    ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****742572",
