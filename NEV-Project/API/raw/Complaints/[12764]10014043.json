I HAVE READ OVER 40 COMPLAINTS DETAILING THE SAME PROBLEM AT THIS LOCATION. THIS ENGINE HAD ONLY 56,000 MILES AND DEALER REFUSED TO WARRANTY OR TO ASSIST WITH COSTS. THIS IS CLEARLY A WIDE RANGING DEFECT AND THIS FLUID LOCK CAN SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY STOP THE ENGINE WHILE IN TRAFFIC CAUSING A POTENTIAL FOR SERIOUS ACCIDENTS. THIS DEFECT AFFECTS ALL GENERAL MOTORS VEHICLES WITH THE 3.8 L ENGINE YET GENERAL MOTORS HAS REFUSED TO DO A RECALL AND I CANNOT DETECT ANY ACTION BY NHTSA TO INVESTIGATE THIS AND FORCE A RECALL. IT IS TIME TO DO THIS.  *JB",
