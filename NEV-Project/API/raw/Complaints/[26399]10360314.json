THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCURENCE. I HAVE 2 SMALL CHILDREN IN THE CAR WITH ME, BUT LUCKILY I WAS PULLING INTO MY OWN DRIVEWAY. I HAD JUST DRIVEN FROM COLUMBUS,OH. A FEW DAYS LATER AFTER TRYING TO RESET MY SYTEM (BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS THE ANTI-THEFT DEVICE) I HAD IT TOWED TO A DEALER. AS IT TURNS OUT MY NEGATIVE BATTERY CABLE HAD BROKEN. ACCORDING TO THE MECHANIC THERE WAS A DEFECT IN THE CORD. THE MECHANIC HAD TO DO SOME RE WIRING. I JUST THANK THE LORD THAT MY CAR DIDN'T CUT OFF WHILE DRIVING. *TR",
