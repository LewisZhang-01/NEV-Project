THE IMPACT OF THE EXPLOSION CAUSED MILD INJURIES.  I TRIED TO WORK WITH TOYOTA ON THIS PROBLEM BUT THEY WERE UNHELPFUL.  I CUT THE AIRBAG OFF AND HAVE CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE. THE HORN WILL NOT WORK AND OF COURSE I HAVE NO AIRBAG PROTECTION.   THE VEHICLE HAD NEVER BEEN IN A WRECK AT THE TIME THAT THE AIRBAG DEPLOYED. I HAVE RECORDS OF MY INTERACTION WITH TOYOTA THAT WILL PROVE THAT. THE VEHICLE WAS IN A WRECK TWO YEARS AFTER THE AIRBAG EXPLODED. I STILL OWN AND DRIVE THE VEHICLE.",
