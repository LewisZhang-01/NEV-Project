        "summary": "2014 GMC SIERRA CURRENTLY WITH 45,000 MILES. VEHICLE SPENT 40+ DAYS AT DEALERSHIP IN 2016 FOR VIBRATION WHILE DRIVING BETWEEN 69-72 MPH THEY COULD NOT FIX DURING 6 DIFFERENT SERVICE VISITS.  IT WAS UNDER 3 YEAR/36K MILE WARRANTY AT THE TIME. BEGAN AT 22,000 MILES.     IN NOV. 2017 VEHICLE BEGAN LOSING POWER STEERING AT SPEEDS UNDER 3 MPH, ESPECIALLY IN REVERSE.    ALSO SERVICE STABILITRAK LIGHT HAS COME ON RANDOMLY AT LOW SPEEDS.  PROBLEM WAS INTERMITTENT BUT IS NOW BECOMING AN ALMOST DAILY OCCURRANCE. AFRAID THIS WILL LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT. SEVERAL CLOSE CALLS ALREADY.    RADIO HAS ALSO TURNED OFF ON ITS ON ABOUT 5 TIMES IN THE LAST 60 DAYS. IT WILL NOT TURN BACK ON UNTIL VEHICLE IS RE-STARTED.       RELATED OR UNRELATED, WHILE DRIVING AT NIGHT AND APPLYING BRAKE PEDAL I NOTICE A 1/2 SECOND DIMMING OF HEADLIGHTS AND DASH LIGHTS BEFORE THEY RETURN TO NORMAL BRIGHTNESS. BATTERY AND ALTERNATOR TESTED FINE BY DEALERSHIP.    DEALERSHIP SAYS VEHICLE VIN IS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY RECALLS.  DEALERSHIP WANTS ME TO REPLACE POWER STEERING GEAR FOR $2,500 WHICH THEY \"THINK\" MIGHT FIX THE PROBLEM.       DON'T WANT TO SPEND $2,500 WITHOUT CERTAINTY IT IS THE PROBLEM.",
