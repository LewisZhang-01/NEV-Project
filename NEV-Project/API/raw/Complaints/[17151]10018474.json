THE ONLY WAY TO TURN THE THINGS OFF, IF THEY MANAGED TO COME ON,  WAS TO TURN OFF THE VEHICLE.  ACCORDING TO LOCAL REPAIR SHOP, REPLACING THE WINDSHIELD WIPER MOTOR CIRCUIT BOARD AND COVER WOULD REMEDY THE PROBLEM.  I DID THAT ON MY OWN EXPENSE AND TIME AND THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN REMEDIED.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD AND THE FACT THAT 1998 MODEL C/K VEHICLES WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE \"RECALL\" OF SEVERAL MODELS UP TO 1997 DEFIES COMMON SENSE.   *JB",
