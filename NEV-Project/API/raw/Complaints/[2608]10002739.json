        "summary": "I BOUGHT NEW A 1998 ROADTREX, CLASS B MOTORHOME ON A 1997 DODGE 3500 MAXI-VAN.  SINCE NEW IT WOULD SWAY, SOMETIMES ALMOST UNCOMTROLABLE WHEN I WOULD DRIVE IN THE RUTS ON FREEWAYS\" CAUSED BY TRUCKS AND STUDDED TIRES\".  I TRIED DIFFRENT THINGS TO TRY TO CORRECT THIS, HD SHOCKS, HIGH TIRE PRESSURES, AIR BAGS ON THE REAR AXLE. I TALK TO OTHERS THAT HAD CHANGED TIRES AND NOTHING SEEMED TO WORK.  THEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE REAR AXLE IS NARROWER THAN THE FRONT AXLE, SO THE REAR TIRES WERE NOT FOLLOWING THE FRONT TIRES. THAT IS WHAT WAS CAUSING THE SWAY WHEN DRIVING IN THE RUTS.  I PUT ON A PAIR OF SPACERS FROM CORRECTRACK INC. SO THE TIRES WOULD LINE UP AND THAT ELIMIATED ALMOST ALL OF THE SWAY.  MY VAN NOW DRIVES LIKE A CAR, WITHOUT HAVING TO FIGHT THE SWAY AND RUTS.  I THINK THAT IT IS A SAFTEY HAZZARD, THAT COULD BE EASILY CORRECTED AT THE FACTORY WITH THE INSTALLATION OF SPACERS OR A WIDER AXLE THAT LINE UP THE WHEELS.  THANK YOU.",
