REMEDY NOT YET AVAILABLE.\" IT IS UNFAIR THAT HONDA OWNERS MUST AVOID THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT OF THE VEHICLE FOR MONTHS, AND REMAIN UNCOMPENSATED BY THE MANUFACTURER. MY FAMILY HAD TO TAKE A MUCH LESS FUEL-EFFICIENT VEHICLE ON TWO ALREADY-PLANNED TRIPS (EASTON, PA, TO ERIE, PA; EASTON, PA, TO OTTAWA, CANADA), AS OUR ONY OTHER CHOICE WAS FOR ONE SPOUSE TO SIT IN THE BACK SEAT OF OUR HONDA ACCORD. WE ALSO HAVE NOT YET RECEIVED A REMEDY FOR RECALL 16V-056, ANOTHER AIRBAG-RELATED ISSUE.",
