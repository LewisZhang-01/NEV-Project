        "summary": "I PURCHASED MY 98 VETTE AS A USED VEHICLE IN 2001. SOON AFTER DRIVING IT I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS SOME SLACK IN THE SEAT POSITION WHETHER ACCELERATING OR STOPPING. I WOULD SAY ABOUT 1.5 INCHES FROM ITS SET POSITION. I CARRIED IT TO THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE HAD BEEN SOME COMPLAINTS, BUT THAT NO BULLETINS HAD BEEN SENT BY CHEVY. I WAS TOLD THAT IF I MOVED THE SEAT TO ITS MAXIMUM LEG ROOM SETTING THAT THEY FELT THAT IT WOULD NOT MOVE WHEN ACCELERATING AND IN STOPPING SITUATION. I MADE THE ADJUSTMENT AND STILL COULD FEEL SOME MOVEMENT OF ABOUT A 1/2\". I WAS THE ONLY DRIVER AND IT STILL SLIPS UNTIL THIS DATE. NO INCIDENT, BUT WITH THE SEAT BEING IN LESS THAN MAXIMUM SETTING AND A NEW DRIVER, I FEEL THAT THIS COULD CREATE A UNFAMILIAR DRIVING OCCURRENCE AND LEAD TO GREATER CHANCE OF POSSIBLE CRASH FROM OVER COMPENSATING FOR THE SEAT ACTUALLY MOVING WHEN IT SHOULD BE STABLE IN A SET POSITION.   *TR",
