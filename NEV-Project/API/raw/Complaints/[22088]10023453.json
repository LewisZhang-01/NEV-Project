UPON RETRIEVING THE RETAINING PLATE IT WAS FOUND THAT THE PLATE HAS STRETCHED FROM USE (4500 MILES) AND NO LONGER PREVENTED THE HEAD OF THE RETAINING BOLT FROM TURNING. THE SAME PROBLEM WAS OBSERVED ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE MOTORCYCLE. I HAVE OBSERVED THIS SAME PROBLEM ON ANOTHER BIKE OF THE SAME MAKE ON A PREVIOUS OCCASION.   *NLM",
