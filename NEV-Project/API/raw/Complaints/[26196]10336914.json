I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER, AND THEY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A WASTEGATE MALFUNCTION.  I PICKED IT UP FROM THE DEALER ON 06/08/10 AND DROVE IT TO FLORIDA ON 06/09/10.  AFTER BEING IN FLORIDA FOR 4 DAYS, THE PROBLEM RETURNED.  THE I-DRIVE SYSTEM FROZE AND EVENTUALLY POWERED OFF AND CAME RIGHT BACK ON.  THE CAR SAT OVERNIGHT, AND I MADE IT BACK TO ATLANTA THE NEXT DAY WITHOUT ANY ISSUES (NO ERROR ON THE DISPLAY).  TOOK IT TO THE DEALER ON MONDAY, 06/14 AND THIS TIME A LOW PRESSURE SENSOR WAS DIAGNOSED AS THE PROBLEM.  PICKED IT UP FROM THE DEALER YESTERDAY (06/16) AND DROVE HOME WITHOUT INCIDENT.  DROVE TO WORK TODAY (06/17), NO PROBLEM.  ON THE WAY HOME TODAY, THE PROBLEM RESURFACED.  THE CAR WILL BE GOING BACK TO THE DEALER TOMORROW.  THIS WILL BE THE 3RD TIME IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS.  THESE CARS APPEAR TO BE DEFECTIVE.  THIS IS REALLY FRUSTRATING! *TR",
