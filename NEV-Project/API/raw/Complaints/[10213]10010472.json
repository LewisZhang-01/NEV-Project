        "summary": "MY MOTHER WAS RECENTLY INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT THAT TOTALED HER CAR.  MY BROTHER AND HIS WIFE WERE THE FIRST OWNERS OF THE VEHICLE, AND MY MOTHER HAD THE CAR FOR ABOUT 1 1/2 YEARS.  SHE HAD STOPPED, PUT THE CAR INTO PARK, GOT OUT TO OPEN A PARKING LOT GATE, GOT BACK IN, STEPPED ON THE BRAKE, AND TRIED TO SHIFT THE CAR INTO GEAR.  SHE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME GETTING THE CAR BACK INTO GEAR.  SHE FINALLY WAS ABLE TO SHIFT AND THE CAR IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO A HIGH REV AND ACCELERATED UNCONTROLLABLY.  THIS RESULTED IN THE CAR SMASHING INTO A WALL LESS THAN 60 FEET AWAY.  LUCKILY THE AIR BAGS WORKED AND MY MOTHER & STEP-FATHER'S INJURIES WERE NOT TOO SERIOUS.  MY MOTHER'S FOOT WAS DEFINITELY ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AS THERE IS A LOCK OUT MECHANISM THAT PREVENTS THE CAR FROM BEING TAKEN OUT OF PARK IF THE BRAKE PEDAL IS NOT PUSHED.  THIS MAY OR MAY NOT BE RELATED, BUT SHE WAS HAVING  DIFFICULTY GETTING THE HANDLE TO MOVE.  THE PROBLEM WITH IT NOT MOVING HAD OCCURRED PREVIOUSLY, USUALLY ON A SLIGHT INCLINE, BUT THE HONDA DEALER LOOKED AT IT AND TOLD HER NOTHING WAS WRONG.  MY MOTHER IS A RETIRED SCHOOL BUS DRIVER WITH A PERFECT DRIVING RECORD, NO ACCIDENTS, AND ONLY USES ONE FOOT TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE.  NOW SHE IS AFRAID TO DRIVE AND IS WORRYING AND SECOND GUESSING HERSELF THAT SHE DID SOMETHING WRONG.  I HAVE FOUND OVER 30 SIMILAR COMPLAINTS REGARDING 1998 HONDA ACCORDS.  I DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY OTHER HONDA'S ARE HAVING SIMILAR PROBLEMS.  IT APPEARS THAT HONDA CONTINUES TO PLACE THE BLAME ON DRIVER ERROR, BUT WE BELIEVE THERE IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM HERE.  *JB",
