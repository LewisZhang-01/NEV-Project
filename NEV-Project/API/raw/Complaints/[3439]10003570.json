THE FIRST TIME WAS NOVEMBER WHEN 2 COILS FAILED CAUSING CAR TO BE ALMOST UNDRIVABLE, NO ACCELARATION AND VERY HARD TO MAINTAIN SPEED.  SECOND FAILURE, LUCKILY, ONLY HAPPENED A COUPLE OF BLOCKS FROM THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP.  SAME PROBLEM WITH NO POWER, ETC.  IF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY IT COULD LEAD TO A RATHER BAD ACCIDENT.  THIS PROBEM SEEMS VERY PREVELANT ON THE 2001 AND 2002 VW AND AUDI MODELS WITH THE 1.8 TURBO ENGINE.",
