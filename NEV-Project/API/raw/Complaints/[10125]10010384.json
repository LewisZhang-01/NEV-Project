THE DEALER SAID THIS COMPONENT WAS ONLY WARRANTED FOR 12,000 MILES, BUT REPAIRED THE CAR AT NO COST.  AT ABOUT 26,000 MILES THE CAR BEGAN TO SHAKE AGAIN WHEN THE BRAKES WERE APPLIED.  AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC SAID THE ROTORS WERE AGAIN WARPED, BUT THEY COULD NOT BE TURNED BECAUSE THIS WOULD MAKE THEM TOO THIN.  HE RECOMMENDED REPLACING THE ROTORS WITH AN AFTER MARKET SET DUE TO THE FACT THE GM ROTORS SEEM TO WARP PREMATURELY.*JB",
