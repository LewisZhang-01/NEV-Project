THE TIRES HAVE 30,000 MILES WITH MINIMAL TREAD WEAR, HOWEVER, THE SIDEWALLS ON ALL 4 TIRES ARE SPLITTING TO THE CORD.  CONTACT WITH FIRESTONE RESULTED IN A VERBAL EXPLANATION THAT THEY WOULD RECOGNIZE THIS AS A 'ROAD HAZARD' SITUATION AND PRO-RATE 50% OF THE COST OF REPLACEMENT WITH FIRESTONE/BRIDGESTONE TIRES.  THE FIRESTONE CONSUMER AFFAIRS/RETAIL OPERATIONS REPRESENTATIVE FURTHER ADVISED THAT THE NTSB HAS COMPLETED AN INVESTIGATION OF THESE TIRES AND FOUND NO REASON FOR A RECALL.   *NLM",
