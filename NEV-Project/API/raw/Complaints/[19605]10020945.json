THIS IA A DESIGN AND SAFETY ISSUE.  MY WINDSHIELD CRACKED MONDAY APRIL 14.  A SMALL STONE MAY HAVE HIT IT, BUT THE CRACK DID NO BEGIN UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING.    RANDOM CRACKS DUE TO STONES AND ROCKS ARE TO BE EXPECTED FROM TIME TO TIME.  BUT THE OCCURRENCE OF CRACKS ON THE MIJI COOPER S IS EPIDEMIC AND WIDELY KNOWN.  THE COMPANY DENIES THIS IS A DESIGN OR MANUFACTURING ISSUE, BUT THE FREQUENCY OF THESE CRACKS, ADMITTED BY THE MINI COOPER DEALER NETWORK, IS WIDELY KNOWN TO BR A PROBLEM WITH THE CAR, AND THERE IS NO POLICY TO REMEDY IT, OTHER THAN HAVING THE WINDHSILED REPLACED AT A COST EXCEEDING $600.  THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE MEANT THAT HUNDRED IF NOT THOUSANDS OF OWNERS ROUTINELY ARE FORCED TO DRIVE THEIR CARS FOR LONG PERIODS WITH CRACKED WINDSHIELDS--A CLEAR SAFETY ISSUE.*AK",
