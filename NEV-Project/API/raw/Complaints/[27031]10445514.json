THIS HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE NOT PRESSING ON THE GAS AT ALL BUT LUNGES FORWARD ON ITS OWN.      WHEN DRIVING AT A HIGH SPEED IT DOES THE OPPOSITE AND THE EMERGENCY BRAKE/PARKING BRAKE TRIES TO ENGAGE. FOR INSTANCE I WAS GOING 60 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY AND THE ABS AND PARKING BRAKE LIGHT CAME ON, THE SPEEDOMETER DROPPED TO 0, AND THE RPMS REVVED UP. MY FOOT WAS ON THE GAS THE ENTIRE TIME YET THE VEHICLE KEPT PULLING BACK LIKE IT WAS TRYING TO ENGAGE THE BRAKES. *TR",
