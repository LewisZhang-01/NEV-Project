I BELONG TO CLUBGP.COM.  THERE ARE PLENTY OF US ON CLUBGP WHO ARE COMPLAINING OF THIS SAME ISSUE.  GOING WIDE OPEN THROTTLE, IT RUNS FINE.  WHEN LIGHTLY DEPRESSING THE GAS PEDAL AT AROUND 25-30 MPH, THE RPM'S DROP TO ABOUT 1500 AND IT SEEMS TO REQUIRE AN AWFUL LOT OF EFFORT TO ACCELERATE.  THE CAR SIMPLY BOGS.  THIS HAS HAPPENED OFF AND ON FOR THE PAST 6 MONTHS.  FRIENDS OF MINE ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM.  I WOULD LIKE A RECALL DONE ON THIS AS THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM.",
