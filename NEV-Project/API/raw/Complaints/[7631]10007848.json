THE FIRST INCIDENT OCCURED IN DECEMBER, THE SECOND IN JANUARY, AND NOW IT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN AGAIN NOW IN FEBRUARY. EACH INCIDENT IS PRELUDED BY A SLIGHT JOLT IN THE CAR UPON START UP FOLLOWED BU ROUGH IDLEING. EVERY TIME WE TAKE IT AND AND ARE TOLD IT IS FIXED AND THEN SURE ENOUGH A MONTH LATER I AM BACK THERE AGAIN. I DO NOT SEE THIS PROBLEM GETTING ANY BETTER. IN ADDITION THE MACH RSTEREO SYSTEM HAS BEEN FIXED, THEN REPLACED. THE REPLACEMENT UNIT'S QULAITY IS POOR IN COMPARISON TO THE ORIGINAL. THIS CAR HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE.",
