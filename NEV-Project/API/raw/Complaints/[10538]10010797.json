THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THERE ARE SOME NEWER MARATHONS WITH LONGER STRAPS UP 24\" WHERE AS THE STRAP ON MINE AND SEVERAL OTHERS MEASURES 12\". THESE IN MY OPINION ARE NOT LONG ENOUGH TO ENABLE A PROPER INSTALL IN SOME VEHICLES. I SPOKE WITH A REP AT BRITAX USA AND THEY DENIED THAT THEY HAVE MADE LONGER STRAPS. I HAVE SEEN A PICTURE OF TWO MARATHONS BACK-TO-BACK AND ON ONE, THE STRAPS ARE TWICE AS LONG.  *JB",
