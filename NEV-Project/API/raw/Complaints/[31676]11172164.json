ON TWO OCCASIONS I HAVE LOST POWER WHEN DRIVING ON A MAJOR STREET WITH 1/4-1/2 TANK OF FUEL.  THIS STALL IS PRECEEDED BY A LOUD, DISONATE NOISE FROM THE FUEL FILLER.  THERE IS WWW INFORMATION REGARDING FAILED PURGE VALVES, BUT MOST INFORMATION IS FOR EARLIER MODELS. THE FOCUS RECALL SEEMS IDENTICAL.  THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SAFETY ISSUE AND I HAVE TAKEN THE CAUTION TO STAY OFF THE ROAD AFTER FUELING TILL THE  ENGINE IS RUNNING SMOOTHLY.  CODES CHECKED WITH ONLY ONE READING COMING UP -A YEAR AGO.",
