SO, I IMMEDIATELY SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT FOR MY VEHICLE.  ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT THEY ARE ONLY GOING TO REPLACE THE IGINITION RECOILS IF THE VEHICLE EXPERIENCES THIS MALFUNCTION.  MY CONCERN IS THAT WHY WOULD I WANT TO DRIVE A VEHICLETHAT COULD POSSIBLY LOSE POWER AT ANYTIME??  EVIDENUTALLY, THIS IS A CONCERN TO VOLKSWAGON BECAUSE THEY SENT A LTR TO THEIR CUSTOMERS.  AS A CUSTOMER, I AM VERY CONCERNED KNOWING MY VEHICLE HAS A POSSIBLE PROBLEM AND THE DEALER(VOLKSWAGON) WILL NOT  TAKE ACTION!  WHY THEN WAS I EVEN NOTIFIED ABOUT THE PROBLEM?",
