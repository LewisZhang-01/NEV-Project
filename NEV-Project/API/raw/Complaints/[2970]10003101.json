THE ENGINE REVVED UP HIGH SUDDENLY, BUT WE WEREN'T MOVING MUCH.  I LET OFF THE GAS. THE VAN ROLLED FOR A BIT, BUT ONCE WE STOPPED IT WOULDN'T GO ANY MORE.  NO GEARS AT ALL.  DEALER ADVISED WE NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION.  WARRENTY JUST EXPIRED.  ONLY 43,000 MILES. I CALLED FORD AND THEIR RESPONSE WAS ALONG THE LINES OF \"YEAH, THAT'S A REAL SHAME.\"",
