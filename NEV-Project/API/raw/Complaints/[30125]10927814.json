        "summary": "I HAVE NOW HAD TO REPLACE MY BACKSEAT SEAT BELTS 3 TIMES, TWICE ON THE PASSENGER BACKSEAT AND ONCE ON THE DRIVER BACKSEAT. MIND YOU THESE ARE SEAT BELTS THAT DO NOT GET LATCHED AND UNLATCHED SEVERAL TIMES A DAY LIKE THE DRIVER SEAT, BUT THESE SEAT BELTS STAY LATCHED WITH A CAR SEAT SO THEY SHOULD NOT BE GETTING WORE OUT SO QUICK. ALSO THESE BELTS BROKE WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY, NO PRESSURE ON THEM. THIS IS EXTREMELY SCARY FOR ME ESPECIALLY SINCE MY TWO CHILDREN RIDE IN THESE SEATS DAILY AND THE SEAT BELTS BROKEN WITH OUT ANY PRESSURE. WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IF I GET REAR ENDED BY SOMEONE GOING 50 MPH???? I CONTACTED FORD AND THEY ONLY WANTED TO DO 2 THINGS: CONTINUE TO REPLACE THE SEAT BELTS AS THE BREAK...REALLY, NEXT TIME IT COULD BE BROKE FROM A WRECK!! THE OTHER OPTION WAS TO TRADE MY CAR IN. FIRST OFF THEY DID NOT OFFERED ME NOWHERE NEAR WHAT I WOULD NEED, SECONDLY AND MOST IMPORTANT IF I TRADED IT IN I CAN ALMOST GUARANTEE THAT THEY WOULD TURN AROUND AND SELL IT TO SOMEONE ELSE. I HAVE HAD SEVERAL VEHICLES FROM FORD HECK MY HUSBAND USED TO WORK THERE, BUT I WAS EXTREMELY SURPRISED AND DISAPPOINTED IN THE LACK OF CARE OR WORRY FOR MY FAMILIES SAFETY IN THIS MATTER.",
