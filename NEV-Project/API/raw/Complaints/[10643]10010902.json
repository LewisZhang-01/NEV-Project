WHEN FLUCTUATION OCCURS IDLE SPEED RANGES BETWEEN 450 RPMS TO 650 RPMS.  ENGINE VIBRATES DUE TO LOW IDLE RPM AND HAS STALLED ON ONE OCCASION.  TO PREVENT STALL OUT I NEED TO SHIFT AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION INTO NEUTRAL.  HAVE BEEN TO DEALER TWICE AND WAS TOLD THEY CAN'T FIX AS NO TSB HAS BEEN RECEIVED ALLOWING FOR CHANGE TO COMPUTER.  THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM SINCE I BOUGHT THE TRUCK NEW LAST JUNE.  NOT JUST DATE SPECIFIC AS REQUESTED BY AN INCIDENT DATE.  *JB",
