ACCORDING TO RESEARCH THAT I HAVE DONE ON THE INTERNET I HAVE LEARNED THAT THIS IS A VERY WIDESPREAD PROBLEM.  ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS DO A SEARCH ON YAHOO WITH THE TERMS \"CHEVROLET SILVERADO ABS MODULE\" AND A HUGE AMOUNT OF RESPONSES COME UP.  GM IS CHARGING BETWEEN $1000 AND $1500 TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  SINCE THIS IS SUCH AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR, TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WHAT MOST PEOPLE ARE DOING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IS PULLING THE FUSE ON THE ABS SYSTEM.  THIS MEANS THAT THEY HAVE NO ANTI-LOCK BRAKES AND THE BRAKE LIGHT IS CONSTANTLY ON.  THEREFORE THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL IF THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES.  I FEEL THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN AND GM SHOULD BE FORCED TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. *JB",
