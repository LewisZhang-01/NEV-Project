WE HAD IT FIXED BY A MECHANIC BUT CAN STILL SMELL ANTIFREEZE THE SAME SMELL WHEN THE WATER PUMP WENT OUT AND CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME BACK ON. HOPEFULLY YOU PEOPLE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT OR IF THERE ARE MORE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IT COST US A LOT OF MONEY AND HAD TO CANCEL APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE OF IT. THE CAR WAS BEING DRIVEN BY MY WIFE ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN SHE NOTICED SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY HEAT PULLED INTO A DRIVEWAY AND SAW LOTS OF FLUID AROUND THE ENGINE WITH A STRONG SMELL OF ANTIFREEZE.",
