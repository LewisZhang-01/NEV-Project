AT VARIOUS STATIONS ... DOES NOT STOP THE FLOW. AT OTHER TIMES, FUEL GUSHES OUT EVEN IF THE PUMP SHUTS OFF.  I HAVE TRIED SLOWING THE RATE FUEL GOES INTO THE TANK.  SOMETIMES THIS WORKS.  OTHER TIMES, IT DOESN'T.  THE ONLY WAY TO AVOID THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION IS TO TRY TO CALCULATE HOW MUCH FUEL IT WILL TAKE TO FILL THE VEHICLE AND THEN STOP THE FLOW MYSELF A COUPLE OF GALLONS EARLY.  THERE IS A JEEP TSB OUT ON THIS PROBLEM.  AND THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS.  THE FUEL SPILLAGE ISSUE IS DANGEROUS AND SHOULD BE A RECALL ITEM.  *TR",
