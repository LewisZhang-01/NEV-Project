HOWEVER COMING BACK FROM VACATION IN THE AUTUMN OF 2001, I WAS COMING THROUGH A MOUNTAIN PASS AT 10:30 PM.  IT WAS RAINING VERY HARD AND ON A TWO LANE HIGHWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS QUIT.  I HAD MY WIFE AND 2 YOUNG DAUGHTERS IN THE SECOND ROW SEAT.  THERE WAS NO SHOULDER TO PULL OVER ON, AND IN THE PITCH BLACK I THOUGHT FOR SURE WE WOULD EITHER END UP IN THE OTHER LANE AND HIT AN ONCOMING CAR OR END UP IN THE DITCH.  I HAD THE WINDSHIELD WIPER MODULE CHANGED AT CAPITOL CHEVROLET IN SALEM OREGON.  I HAVE THE INVOICE.  I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS TO GO THROUGH THE SAME SITUATION AS WE DID.  I AM AWARE OF THE RECALL ON CERTAIN CHEVROLET MODELS, BUT IT DOES NOT INCLUDE 1998 MODELS...BIG MISTAKE...IT SHOULD INCLUDE 1998'S ALSO.  *JB",
