        "summary": "I  HAVE OWNED A 2005 CHRYSLER PACIFICA FOR SEVEN MONTHS.  OVER THAT PERIOD, I HAVE DOCUMENTED A TOTAL 6 STALLING EVENTS.  THE COMMON TRIGGER SEEMS TO BE DECELERATION WHILE TURNING OR SLIGHTLY TURNING EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT.  THE SPEEDS DURING THE STALLING EVENTS HAVE  TWICE OCCURRED  AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, AND FOUR TIMES WHILE DECELERATING FROM  SPEEDS  OF 30 - 45 TO NEAR 0.  ON ONE OCCASION, WHILE AT 45 - 50 MPH AND CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT, THE VEHICLE STALLED AFFECTING THE STEERABILITY AND THE CAR RAN OFF THE ROAD STRIKING A HARD OBJECT THAT CAUSED THE FRONT TIRE TO BLOW OUT AND DESTRUCTION OF THE FRONT RIM AND BENDING THE REAR RIM.  A POLICE OFFICER WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE OF THIS INCIDENT.  THE DEALER HAS BEEN CONSULTED TWICE NOW.  THE FIRST VISIT TO THE DEALER WAS UNEVENTFUL AFTER A \"THOROUGH\" CHECKOVER, ENDING WITH A STATEMENAT THAT THERE WAS NO RECORD OF SIMILAR EVENTS AND THUS NOTHING COULD BE DONE.  THE SECOND VISIT, AFTER THE INCIDENT MENTIONED ABOVE, THE DEALER PUT NEAR 300 MILES ON THE VEHICLE WITHOUT DUPLICATION AND, AGAIN, STATING THAT THERE IS NO SUCH HISTORY OF SIMILAR EVENTS.  NOT TO MENTION, THE DEALER PUT THE 300 MILES ON THE DONUT TIRE (BECAUSE OF THE DAMAGE TO THE TIRES AND RIMS).  THE DEALER REFUSED TO REPLACE THE DAMAGED RIMS AND TIRES AND SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THAT THEY COULD OR WOULD DO.  WHEN NOTING THAT MY CONFIDENCE IN THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN SHATTERRED AND MY CONCERN FOR MY LIFE WAS THE REAL ISSUE,  THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.  AFTER ALL THIS, THE DEALER FAILED TO NOTIFY US OF THE 2004 RECALL FOR THE SAME TYPE OF STALLING EVENT.",
