I WAS VERY FORTUNATELY LOADING SOME GROCERIES WHEN IT HAPPENED AND  WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A VERY NICE PERSON WALKING BY, WERE ABLE TO  GET IT BACK INTO PARK AND NO INJURIES ACCRUED, I DREAD TO THINK OF WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF ONE OF MY TWO YOUNG CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN IN MY POSITION, WHAT THE OUTCOME COULD HAVE BEEN.   *NLM",
