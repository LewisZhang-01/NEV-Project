DEALER REFUSED TO RECTIFY PROBLEM UNDER EXTENDED WARRANTY BECAUSE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY I HAVE DOES NOT COVER TRANSMISSIONS. I WAS NOT OFFERED ANY EXTENDED WARRANTY CHOICES WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE. I WAS JUST ASKED IF I WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE ONE. I PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR AN EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT I HAVE USED 1 TIME FOR A FAULTY FUEL PUMP. MEANWHILE, I HAVE HAD A NEW CLUTCH PUT IN ($650), BUT HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO HAVE THE TRANSMISSION REPAIRED YET SO MY CURRENT CLUTCH IS BAD AS WELL DUE TO THE SYNCHRONIZERS BEING FAULTY. SO NOW I HAVE TO PAY FOR ANOTHER NEW CLUTCH AND A NEW TRANNY!",
