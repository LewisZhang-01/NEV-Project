TODAY MY ENGINE SEIZED AND MY CAR WAS TOWED TO A GARAGE. WHILE THE CAR WAS THERE THE MECHANICS LOOKS AT THE ENGINE AND COULD FIND AN ISSUE AND THEN THEY DRAINED THE OIL AND FOUND METAL PIECES MIXED IN. I THEN LOOKED THIS UP TO SEE IF THERE WAS A RECALL AND KIA DID RECALL 2011-2013 KIA SPORTAGES FOR FAULTY ENGINE BUILDING WHICH CAUSES METAL PIECES TO CLOG YOUR OIL FLOW AND SEIZE YOUR ENGINE. SINCE MY CAR IS A 2013 KIA SPORTAGE I CALLED KIA TO SEE IF THEY WOULD FIX IT SINCE THE RECALL BUT THEY SAID MY VIN DOESN'T MATCH THE RECALL AND WON'T ASSIST ME.",
