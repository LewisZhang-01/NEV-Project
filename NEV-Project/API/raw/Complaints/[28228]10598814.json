THERE WAS NO GIVE TO THE BRAKE PEDAL AT ALL, IT WAS AS IF IT WAS LOCKED UP. I ROLLED BACKWARD SEVERAL FEET WHILE STILL PUSHING ON THE BRAKE AND EVENTUALLY THE PEDAL WENT DOWN AND THE CAR STOPPED.  THIS HAPPENED ABOUT A MONTH AGO, BUT I THOUGHT, AT THE TIME, I MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING SILLY LIKE HIT THE FLOORBOARD WITH MY FOOT .  I NOW REALIZE THIS COULD BE A REAL HAZARD TO MYSELF AND OTHERS.  I DID HAVE A RECALL ON THE BRAKES SOME MONTHS AGO AND I TOOK MY CAR INTO TO HAVE IT DONE.  THIS HAS HAPPENED TWICE SINCE CHEVROLET FIXED MY RECALL.  THIS IS VERY CONCERNING!!  *TR",
