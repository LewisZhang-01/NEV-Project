        "summary": "PROBLEM:  MY SON (2 YRS OF AGE) IS OPENING THE ONE PIECE HARNESS TIE (CHEST CLIP) MANUALLY DURING OUR ROAD TRIPS AND IS SLIDING OUT OF THE 5 POINT HARNESS TO FREE HIMSELF FROM THE SEAT.      NOTE:  I EXPLAINED THE SAFETY ISSUES TO HIM, BUT I MUST REMIND YOU THAT A TWO YEAR OLD'S THOUGHT PROCESS IS NOT LIKE THAT OF AN ADULT.  A TWO YEAR OLD CHILD SHOULD NOT HAVE THE ABILITY OF REMOVING HIMSELF FROM A CAR SEAT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.    I WATCHED IN HORROR ONE DAY IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR TO SEE HIM STANDING IN HIS CAR SEAT WHILE I TRAVELED DOWN THE FREEWAY.      THE CAR SEAT IN QUESTION IS A CENTURY-GRACO 1000 STE (MODEL #44161BLC 20010501).  THE SEAT WAS PURCHASED IN 2001 AT BABYRUS IN SAN ANTONIO TEXAS.    I CONTACTED CENTURY PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO ADVISE THEM OF THE PROBLEM.  I THEN ORDERED A REPLACEMENT UNIT, THE 2 PC HARNESS TIE (CHEST CLIP).  THIS DEVICE HAS TWO INDIVIDUAL PIECES THAT CLIP TOGETHER AND IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR A CHILD TO OPEN.  THE ONE PIECE UNIT BENDS VERY EASILY, ALLOWING THE CHILD TO WEAVE THE SEAT BELT HARNESS THROUGH THE CLIP AND FREE HIMSELF FROM THE SEAT.     I RECOMMEND CENTURY REPLACE (FREE OF CHARGE) ALL ONE PC HARNESS TIES WITH THE TWO PC HARNESS TIE UNIT FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL CHILDREN.     I BELIEVE THAT THE COST OF THE REPLACEMENT ($8 INCLUCING S&H) IS FAR LESS THAN THE COST OF LOSS OF LIFE.    THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION WITH THIS MATTER.     THE CENTURY REP HAD NO COMMENTS FOR ME OTHER THAN PURCHASING THE ITEM.  I WAS NOT EXPECTING AN APPOLOGY OR AN ADMISSION OF WRONGDOING, BUT I WAS EXPECTING SOME FORM OF HUMAN CONCERN.      THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION.",
