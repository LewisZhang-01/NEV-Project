        "summary": "I AM HAVING TO REPLACE ALL THE TIRES, WITH ONLY 19,903 MILES ON MY AWD 2017 MINIVAN. AT MY 10,000 MILE TOYOTACARE CHECK, THEY DIDN'T ROTATE THE TIRES BECAUSE THEY SAID NO ROTATION NEEDED DUE TO LESS TREAD ON BACK TIRES, SO ALREADY NOTICING UNEVEN WEAR. AT 15000, THEY ONLY ROTATED ONE SIDE. NOW AT 20,000 THEY TELL ME THE FRONT TIRES SHOW INNER SHOULDER WEAR. THEY DID ROTATE. HAD AN INDEPENDENT DOUBLE CHECK. THE TIRES THAT HAD BEEN ON FRONT ARE VERY WORN/SMOOTH ON INNER SIDE, TREAD LESS THAN 5 IN THE MIDDLE. THESE ARE THE TIRES THAT CAME ON THE MINIVAN WHEN I BOUGHT IT, BRAND NEW. THEY ARE RUN FLAT TIRES. THEY COST OVER $1000, AND LASTED LESS THAN 20,000 MILES, AND ONLY 14 MONTHS OF DRIVING. NO SPARE TIRE OR JACK CAME WITH THE VAN, NOR IS THERE SPACE TO CARRY A SPARE, ALMOST FORCING ME TO BUY MORE RUN FLAT TIRES. FROM WHAT I'VE READ RECENTLY, TOYOTA MINIVANS ARE WEARING TIRES OUT MUCH SOONER THAN OTHER MAKES.",
