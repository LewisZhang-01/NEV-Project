I THE OIL WAS CHANGED EVERY 3000-4000 MILES AND THE MILES ARE ALL FREEWAY MILES. MY MECHANIC HAS STATED THAT THE REAR PISTON AND ROD FAILED. THE PISTON BROKE APART AND DAMAGED THE CYLINDER, HEAD AND VALVES BEYOND REASONABLE REPAIR. I AM FACING THE FACT THAT I NEED TO BUY A REBUILT ENGINE FOR ABOUT $4000 AND NEED IT INSTALLED. I SPOKE TO THE DODGE DEALER WHERE I LEASED THE VEHICLE AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. I SPOKE TO CHRYSLER'S CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY TOLD ME IT WAS PAST THE WARRANTY AND THEY COULD DO NOTHING.",
