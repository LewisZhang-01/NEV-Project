THIS PROBLEM THAT EXIST HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED YET. I HAVE IT AT A MECHANIC, I ALSO CAN NOT DRIVE IT, VERY DANGEROUS. I GOT ONLINE AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE HAVING THE SAME TROUBLE AND HAVE LABELED IT THE FORD DEATH WOBBLE. I TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC ON 12.14.11 WERE IT IS STILL AT AND ON THAT SAME DAY I RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM FORD THAT THERE MIGHT BE A RECALL SOON DUE TO EXCESSIVE SHAKING AND  TO CHECK TIRE PRESSURE. FRONT END ALIGNMENT, TIRE SIZE ETC. THIS NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION, ON THE INTERNET BACK IN 2007 THEY HAD AT LEAST 61 COMPLAINTS. WHATEVER IS CAUSING THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED ASAP BEFORE SOMEONE LOSES CONTROL AND SERIOUSLY HURTS SOMEONE OR THEMSELVES.  *TR",
