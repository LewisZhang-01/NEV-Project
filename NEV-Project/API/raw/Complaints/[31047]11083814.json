THIS SHOWS JUST HOW ABSURDLY WEAK THESE CRITICAL PARTS ARE EVEN WHEN IN NEW CONDITION.   THERE IS A THRIVING MARKET IN USED TESLA PARTS SALVAGED FROM WRECKS BECAUSE TESLA CHARGES VERY HIGH PRICES FOR PARTS AND LABOR.  TESLA IS KNOWN TO BE VERY RELUCTANT TO REPAIR CARS THAT HAVE HAD ANY KIND OF SUSPENSION REPAIRS.  THIS IS FORCING OWNERS TO PERFORM DANGEROUS DIY REPAIRS.    THIS IS PUTTING MANY ROAD -USERS LIVES IN DANGER.  PLEASE TAKE ACTION.    CONCERNED CITIZEN",
