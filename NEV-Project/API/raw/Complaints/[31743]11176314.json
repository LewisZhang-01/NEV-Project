THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THE LOCAL NISSAN DEALERSHIP ADJUSTED THE SENSORS AND SINCE THEN THE AIRBAG INDICATOR HAS NOT BEEN WORKING PROPERLY. I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO HAVE THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT READJUST THE SENSORS IN THE SEAT BUT THAT DID NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM. I HAVE RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP SEVERAL TIMES TO HAVE THE PROBLEM CORRECTED BUT WAS TOLD THEY COULD NOT SEE A PROBLEM. I HAVE TAKEN THEM PICTURES AND VIDEOS SHOWING A PASSENGER IN MY CAR WITH THE AIRBAG LIGHT STILL ON. I HAVE CONTACTED NISSAN CORPORATE WITH THIS PROBLEM AS WELL. NISSAN CORPORATE HAS TOLD ME TO TAKE MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP WHEN THE LIGHT/AIRBAG HAS NOT ENGAGED WHEN PASSENGER IS IN THE SEAT BUT THE LAST INCIDENT HAPPENED AT 7:30 IN THE EVENING WHEN I WAS OUT OF TOWN. THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN ONGOING NOW SINCE 2017. I AM REACHING OUT TO YOU BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I CAN DO TO MAKE MY CAR SAFE FOR EVERYONE THAT RIDES IN IT.  THANK YOU... I ALSO HAVE A VIDEO OF A PASSENGER IN THE SEAT BUT CAN'T GET IT TO LOAD TO THE DOCUMENT.",
