        "summary": "I CURRENTLY DRIVE A 2000 FORD EXPLORER 6 CYL. 2 WHEEL DRIVE W/ GOODYEAR WRANGLER RT/S TIRES.  I WAS RECENTLY NOTIFIED BY MIDAS OF ORLAND PARK AFTER HAVING MY FRONT BRAKES REPLACED THAT THE FRONT PASSENGER TIRE HAS A BELT THAT HAS SHIFTED.  MY TIRES WERE REPLACED DUE TO THE RECALL OF THE FIRESTONE TIRES.  AT THAT TIME I HAD ROUGHLY 16,000 MILES ON THE SUV.  AT THE PRESENT TIME I HAVE JUST UNDER 40,000 MILES ON THE SUV.  I DID NOT NOTICE THAT THE TIRE WAS BAD MAINLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE FORD EXPLORER IS A VERY ROUGH RIDE.  I DO NOT GO OFF ROADING WITH THIS VEHICLE NOR DO INTENTIALLY HIT LARGE BUMPS OR POT HOLES AT A RAPID SPEED.  I AM NOT ONLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE VEHICLE BUT ALSO WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TIRES.  SINCE THE EXPLORER RIDES ROUGH (A SIDE TO SIDE WOBBLING MOTION) I CAN SEE WERE MANY ACCIDENTS OCCURED.  THE OWNER OF THE VEHICLE IS UNABLE TO DETECT A DEFAULT IN THE TIRE.  THE QUESTION I POSE IS, IS FORD AT FAULT BECAUSE OF THERE INADEQUATE ENGINEERING AND UNSTABE SUSPENSION OR IS GOODYEAR AT FAULT FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF FAULTY TIRES?",
