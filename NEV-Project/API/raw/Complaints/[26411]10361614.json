        "summary": "MY NAME IS [XXX] AND I HAVE A 2007 TOYOTA SIENNA WITH AN AIRBAG LIGHT THAT INTERMITTENTLY COMES ON AND OFF. AS A MECHANIC, I RESEARCHED MY AIRBAG LIGHT DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODE B0111 OPEN IN SIDE SQUIB RH CIRCUIT AND THERE IS A TSB ON REPAIRING THE AIRBAG LIGHT. IT SAYS TO REPLACE THE AIRBAG ASSEMBLY IN THE PASSENGER FRONT SEAT. AS MECHANIC, I KNOW THAT WHEN THE AIRBAG LIGHT IS ON, THE AIRBAGS WILL NOT DEPLOY IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION. THEREFORE, I DON'T SEE WHY A SAFETY ISSUE SUCH AS THIS IS NOT A RECALL.  SO INSTEAD OF A RECALL, I MUST NOW SPEND $900 ON JUST THE AIRBAG, NEVERMIND THE COST TO INSTALL IT?  I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH A COSTLY REPAIR DUE TO THE FACT THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT I COULD NOT HAVE PREVENTED.  THE TSB NUMBER IS T-SB-0252-08 FROM MY REPAIR PROGRAM, MITCHELL ON DEMAND AND IT SAYS TOYOTA'S REFERENCE NUMBER IS [XXX].
