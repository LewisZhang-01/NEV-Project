IT KEEPS BLOWING; RESEARCHED FOR RECALLS BUT THERE AREN'T NONE.  LOOKING ONLINE I SEE THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE WITH ALL 2006 KIA SEDONA'S. THIS LAST TIME THAT IT HAPPENED, I WAS ON MY WAY TO WISCONSIN FROM MASSACHUSETTS AND MY LIGHT WENT OUT.  IT WAS A SCARY SITUATION BECAUSE IT MADE THE TRAVEL EXPERIENCE SCARY AND DANGEROUS.  I DIDN'T HAVE MY LOW-BEAM AND WAS FORCED TO USE MY HIGH BEAM.  I WAS PULLED OVER BY POLICE BECAUSE I WAS USING MY HIGH BEAM; I HAD TO EXPLAIN THE SITUATION AND TOLD HIM THAT I WAS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM AS SOON AS AREA MECHANICS OPENED (THIS WAS AT 4:00AM).    I HAVE 3 KIDS AND THIS IS A HAZARD.PROBLEM STARTED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY UPON PURCHASING MY VAN WITH 11K MILES.   *TR",
