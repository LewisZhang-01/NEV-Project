THERE WAS ACTUALLY FIRE INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION, YOU COULD TELL WHEN THE MECHANIC DROPPED THE PAN, THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT EVERY THING WAS FRIED. THAT COULD OF STARTED THE WHOLE PICKUP ON FIRE AND I COULD OF BEEN KILLED OR BADLY HURT. I HAVE TALKED TO SOME OTHER GUYS AND THEY OWNED 1998 RAMS AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED. NOW THIS IS A BIG SAFETY THING AND THERE WAS NOT A RECALL ON THE FAULTY TRANSMISSION. I CONTACTED CHRYSLER TO SEE IF THEY WOULD PAY FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION AND THEY SAID NO, THEY WOULDN'T EVEN HELP ME OUT. THIS COULD OF BEEN A BIG LAW SUIT IF I WOULD OF GOTTEN HURT.   *JB",
