WIRES ARE SHORTING WHICH ALMOST LED TO AN ACCIDENT, COULD LEAD TO A FIRE AND HAVE CAUSED THE ANTI SLIP REGULATOR SAFETY SYSTEM TO FAIL AND THE CAR TO RUN IN LIMP MODE WITH SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED POWER.  CAR WAS IN MOTION WHEN I LOST POWER INITIALLY AND AT THE TIME WAS SURPRISED BY THE LOSS OF POWER.  I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO CONTROL ALMOST CAUSING AN ACCIDENT SINCE THE GAS PEDAL STOPPED FULLY RESPONDING TO INPUT.  I HAD NO IDEA THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM AND AM SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THIS HAS NOT BEEN PUT OUT AS A RECALL ITEM.",
