        "summary": "I HAVE A 2002 VOLKSWAGEN PASSET THAT HAD TO BE TOWED THREE TIMES FOR FAILED IGNITION PACKS. THE VEHICLE WAS IN THE SHOP A TOTAL OF FOUR TIMES. VOLKSWAGEN WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND NEVER CONTACTED THE CONSUMERS OR THE OWNERS OF THIS PROBLEM. THEY ADVISED THAT THEY WOULD ONLY REPLACE THE COIL THAT WENT BAD AND NOT ALL AT ONCE. IF THE COMPANY IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM THEN THEY SHOULD HAVE TAKEN SOME ACTION BY NOTIFYING THE COMSUMERS. VOLKSWAGEN'S ARE SUPOSED TO BE RELIABLE, BUT IT SEEMS THEY ARE NOT AT LEAST FOR THE 2001/2002 PASSET. PLEASE TAKE TIME TO LOOK INTO THIS MATTER. MY INCIDENTS OCCURRED LAST FEB, MAY, DEC, AND JAN 03. I ALSO ASKED VOLKSWAGEN WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIRS AFTER THE WARRANTY RUNS OUT. I WAS TOLD THAT I COULD ALWAYS SEND IN THE REPAIR AMOUNT TO SEE IF THEY WOULD REIMBURSE ME.                                                                             THANK YOU",
