I WAS TOLD BY MY MECHANIC MY BRAKES WERE BAD AND ROTORS NEEDED TO BE REPLACE AND THERE WAS A SENSOR THAT HAD TO BE ORDERED BEFORE I COULD USE THE CAR AFTER IT WAS REPAIRED. IT HAD 11,000 MILES!!  I DOUBT MY BRAKES WERE EVEN BAD AT THAT POINT I THINK IT WAS JUST A SENSOR AFTER ALL. (AFTER IT COST ME $480.00 PLUS I HAD TO RENT A CAR FOR 3 DAYS.  MY TRANSMISSION KEPT SURGING AT THE STOP LIGHTS FROM THE DAY I GOT IT AT 1,471 MILES. SO IT WAS PROBABLY BAD FROM DAY ONE. I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN IT RIGHT BACK TO WHERE I BOUGHT IT, AT LEAST IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER WARRANTY.  I HAD MY TRANSMISSION REPLACED AT 30,000 MILES AT A COST OF $6,000.",
