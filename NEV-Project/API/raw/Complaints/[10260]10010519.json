THE CAR HAS 23,000 MILES ON IT AND HAS GONE THROUGH 3 SETS OF BRAKES.  THE CAR COMPLETELY DIED ON TWO OCCASIONS, BOTH NEEDING BATTERY TO BE BOOSTED.  THEN ALL OF THE DASHBOARD LIGHTS WERE FLASHING CRAZY. ON ONE OF THOSE OCCASIONS, IT DIED RIGHT IN FRONT OF HONDA, AFTER THEY ASSURED ME THAT MY CAR WAS FINE.  THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH HONDA.  THEY FAIL TO FIND ANY OF THE SERIOUS PROBLEMS THAT ARE CONTINUING.  THE CAR MAKES ALL KIND OF RATTLING AND CLICKING NOISES WHEN DRIVING, HONDA FINDS NOTHING.  THE WINDOWS/WINDSHIELD FOG UP, DEFROSTER DOES NOT WORK WELL, HONDA FINDS NOTHING.  ALL FOUR TIRES ARE LEAKING, HONDA AT FIRST FIND NOTHING WRONG, NOW SAY I HAVE TO REPLACE TIRES.  THE DRIVER'S SEAT IS LOOSE AND ROCKING, HONDA REPLACED SEAT TRACK TWICE, PROBLEM CONTINUES, TOOK CAR IN AGAIN FOR SEAT, HONDA FINDS NOTHING WRONG.  SEAT ROCKING GETS WORSE, MAKING LOAD NOISE WHEN DRIVING, AFRAID FOR SAFETY.  NOW THE CAR IS GETTING WORSE, CAR BRAKES WITHOUT PUTTING FOOT ON BRAKE, CAR IS SLUGGISH, DRIVING FUNNY.  I THINK THIS IS THE TRANSMISSION THAT IS GOING TO GO BAD.   IT STALLS TO START VERY OFTEN, THEN COMPLETELY FAILED TWICE, NEEDING BOOST.  IM VERY CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY AT THIS POINT.  I EVEN REACHED OUT TO HONDA CONSUMER AFFAIRS IN CALIFORNIA, THEY DID NOT HELP AT ALL, IN FACT THEY WERE RUDE AND EVEN THREATENED ME, WHILE I HAD THE RENTAL, TO REPORT THE RENTAL STOLEN BECAUSE I ASKED IF I COULD HOLD THE RENTAL UNTIL HONDA FIXED MY CAR (ESPECIALLY SINCE THE CAR HAD DIED RIGHT IN FRONT OF HONDA, AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, MY CAR WAS DENTED, TWICE, WHILE BEING \"FIXED\" BY HONDA THAT DAY AS WELL)  I AM COMPLETELY DISGUSTED WITH THE CAR AND THE SERVICE IVE GOTTEN.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER PROBLEMS I DIDN'T LIST HERE, TOO MANY TO LIST.  I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HELP IN THIS MATTER, THANK YOU.   *NLM",
