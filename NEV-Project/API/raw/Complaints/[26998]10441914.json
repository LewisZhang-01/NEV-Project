        "summary": "ABOUT 18 MONTHS AGO THE HEADLIGHTS ON MY 2004 TL BEGAN FLICKERING ON AND OFF WHILE I WAS DRIVING.  I TOOK THE CAR TO ACURA BUT THEY COULDN'T FIND THE PROBLEM AND THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD COST $1000 TO DO AN \"APPROPRIATE DIAGNOSTIC TEST\".  THE PROBLEM WITH THE HEADLAMPS STOPPED AFTER A FEW MONTHS, BUT THEN OTHER LIGHTS BEGAN GOING OUT (INTERIOR CENTER CONSOLE WHERE THE AC AND RADIO ARE, AND THE INTERIOR CONSOLE TO THE LEFT OF THE STEERING WHEEL, AND THE INTERIOR DOOR CONSOLE) AND FLICKERING (EXTERIOR SIDE PANEL LIGHTS WHEN I ALARM OR DIS-ALARM THE CAR).  I TOOK THE CAR TO ACURA AGAIN IN NOV 2011, AND THEY TOLD ME THE PROBLEM WAS WAS FIXED AFTER THEY REPLACED MY BATTERY, BUT THEY MISTAKENLY ONLY LOOKED AT THE DRIVER'S DASHBOARD LIGHTS WHERE THE SPEEDOMETER/ODOMETER ARE LOCATED (AND WHERE THERE IS NO PROBLEM) AND THE TECHS DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. THIS LIGHTING PROBLEM IS GETTING UNSAFE, AS I CAN NO LONGER SEE THE BUTTONS FOR THE AC/DEFROST, ETC. AT NIGHT AND I HAVE TO FUMBLE AROUND TO PRESS THE CORRECT BUTTONS. I KNOW I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS ISSUE.  THE BATTERY WAS SO DRAINED THAT I HAD TO REPLACE IT, I BELIEVE BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.  *KB",
