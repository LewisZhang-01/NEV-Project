I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION, OPENED THE HOOD AND PULLED THE WIRE FROM THE SWITCH. TRUCK IS 1997 FORD F250. I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF THE TRUCK. I TOOK THE TRUCK TO CLINTON FORD IN ROCK HILL, SC AND THEY PUT A CRUISE CONTROL SWITCH IN AT A COST OF $292.09. NOW I SEE THAT THERE WAS A RECALL 05S28 THAT APPLIES TO THE TRUCK THAT I NEVER RECEIVED NOTICE FOR. MY COMPLAINT IS THAT FORD DID NOT NOTIFY ME OD THIS SAFETY RECALL. THEN WHEN THE RECALL REPAIR WAS PERFORMED, I WAS BILLED FOR THE REPAIR. *TR",
