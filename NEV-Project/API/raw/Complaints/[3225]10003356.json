MY DEALER WAS VERY GOOD ABOUT IT AND REPLACED  BAD COIL AND OTHER 3 AS PREVENTIVE MEASURE.  HOWEVER, I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY OTHER 2002 PASSAT'S WITH MULTIPLE IGNITION COIL FAILURES-ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, RESULTING IN SEVERAL TRIPS TO THE DEALER.  THIS IGNITION COIL FAILURE CAN BE VERY HAZARDOUS, ESPECIALLY DURING HIGHWAY DRIVING.    ALL CAR OWNERS SHOULD BE INFORMED ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, AND  HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIX THIS BEFORE BEING INJURED OR STRANDED.  THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THESE IGNITION COILS.",
