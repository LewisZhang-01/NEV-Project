MY CAR BEEN IN THE SHOP FOR CLOSE TO A MONTH BECAUSE THE PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE.      I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT VW HAS BEEN LYING TO CUSTOMERS (INCLUDING ME) WHEN BLAMING THE FAILURES ON DEFECTIVE COILS MANUFACUTRED BY A 3RD PARTY.  HOWEVER, I HAVE LEARNED THAT IT IS A DESIGN DEFECT IN THE NEW 2002 1.8T MODEL THAT CAUSES A MOISTURE BUILD UP THAT THE COILS CANNOT WITHSTAND.  VW ASKED THE 3RD PARTY MANUFACTURE A NEW COIL THAT CAN WITHSTAND THE MOISTURE, WHICH HAS BEEN DONE.  THE SHORTAGE HAS BEEN CAUSED BY THE FACT THAT THE NEW COILS NEED TO GO INTO THE NEW 2003 MODELS FIRST, LEAVING THOSE OF US WITH CARS THAT DON'T RUN TO WAIT.  VW IS STILL REFUSING TO REPLACE ANY COIL UNTIL IT FAILS.  SO MUCH FOR A RELIABLE NEW CAR.",
