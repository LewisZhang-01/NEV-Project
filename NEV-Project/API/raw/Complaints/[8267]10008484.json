        "summary": "THE HOOD OF THE VEHICLE HAS PAINT BUBBLING AT THE FRONT PEAK.  THIS IS AN ALUMINUM HOOD AND THE BUBBLING IS A RESULT OF OXIDATION WHICH, ACCORDING TO THE LOCAL SERVICE MANAGER, IS A KNOWN PROBLEM.  THE FACTORY ZONE REPRESENTATIVE DECLINED TO FIX THE PROBLEM, EVEN THOUGH THE MANAGER SAID THERE WAS A FIX FOR IT NOW, DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE CAR IS OUTSIDE OF THE ORIGINAL MANUFACTURERS WARRANTY.  MY ARGUMENT IS THAT THE CAR IS JUST BARELY TWO YEARS OLD AND SHOULDN'T BE HAVING PROBLEMS LIKE THIS ALREADY.  THE FACT THAT THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY DOES NOT NEGATE THE FACT THAT THERE IS A KNOWN PROBLEM AND PONTIAC IS UNWILLING TO FIX IT. THIS PROBLEM, ALONG WITH FOUR MORE PROBLEMS, IS LEAVING ME SORRY I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE.  ALTHOUGH MY FATHER RETIRED FROM GM, IF THIS IS THE KIND OF SERVICE I CAN EXPECT FROM PONTIAC, I WILL REFRAIN FROM BUYING ANY OTHER GM PRODUCTS AND STAY WITH FORD AS THEY HAVE ROUTINELY TAKEN CARE OF ANY AND ALL PROBLEMS AS THEY HAVE COME UP.  *JB",
