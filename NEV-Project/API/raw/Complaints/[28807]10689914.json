        "summary": "THE CAR HAS A DETECTION SYSTEM IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. THIS SHOULD DETECT IF ANYONE IS IN THAT SEAT. WHEN PASSENGER IS DETECTED, THE PASSENGER AIRBAGS SHOULD BE ACTIVATED. FOR SMALL CHILDREN (UNDER A CERTAIN, NOT SPECIFIED WEIGHT LIMIT), THE AIRBAGS ON PASSENGER SIDE ARE NOT ACTIVATED.  PROBLEM IS THAT THE PASSENGER AIRBAGS ARE NOT EVEN ACTIVATED WHEN MY WIFE IS IN THAT SEAT. SHE IS BORN 06/13/1971 AND WEIGHS ABOUT 130 LB.   OBVIOUSLY, THE PASSENGER AIRBAGS SHOULD BE ACTIVATED WHEN AN ADULT IS IN THAT SEAT THAT WEIGHS ~ 130 LB.  SINCE THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE, WE TOOK THE CAR TO CHEVROLET DEALER (AUTONATION CHEVROLET NORTHPOINT, 2175 MANSELL ROAD, ALPHARETTA, GA, 30004, PHONE 855-478-9750, CONTACT [XXX]). ENGINEER AND SERVICE MANAGER DID ALL CHECKS AND CONCLUDED THE CAR IS OPERATING AS DESIGNED. WE CALLED CHEVROLET OWNER CENTER (SR. MANAGER CALLED [XXX], CASE FILE NR. [XXX]). THEY LOOKED INTO THE CASE AND SPOKE TO CHEVROLET DEALER NORTHPOINT. CONCLUSION IS THE SAME; CAR IS WORKING AS DESIGNED. WE SPOKE TO HIGHER MANAGER OF SR. MANAGER [XXX]  AT CHEVROLET'S OWNER CENTER. SHE ALSO CONCLUDED THE SAME.  IN OUR OPINION, THERE IS A SERIOUS SAFETY HAZARD WITH THE CHEVROLET SONIC 2013 AS AIRBAGS ARE NOT ACTIVATED, EVEN FOR SOME ADULTS. OUR CAR WILL NOT BE FIXED BY CHEVROLET USA OR CHEVROLET DEALER SO WE ARE HOPING YOU CAN ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM.  FOR FURTHER QUESTIONS, PLEASE CONTACT ME AT BELOW CONTACT DETAILS.  THANKS IN ADVANCE,  [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
