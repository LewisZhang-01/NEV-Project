THE DEALER THAT I TOOK IT TO FOR REPAIRS TOLD ME THAT IT WAS NO LONGER UNDER WARRENTY, BUT THAT I COULD CONTACT CHRYSLER TO SEE IF THEY WOULD COVER THE REPAIRS. MY CAR IS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE AND ONLY HAS 63,000 MILES ON IT. CHRYSLER HAS DECLINED TO COVER ANY OF THE COST OF PARTS AND SERVICE FOR THIS REPAIR, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE AWARE THAT HEAD GASKETS ARE A DEFECT IN THIS CAR. I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH AND DISCOVERED THAT MANY NEON OWNERS ARE FIGHTING THIS SAME BATTLE. I AM APALLED THAT A RECALL WAS NEVER DONE ON THIS PART.  VIEW OTHERS PROBLEMS WITH THE NEON HEAD GASTKET AT THIS WEBSITE. <HTTP://GROUPS.GOOGLE.COM/GROUPS?Q=NEON+HEAD+GASKET&IE=ISO-8859-1&HL=EN>  I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU COULD GIVE ME ANY ADVICE ON THIS MATTER. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS DEFECT WARRANTS A RECALL?",
