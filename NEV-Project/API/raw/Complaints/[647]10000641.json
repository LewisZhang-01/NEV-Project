AGAIN THERE IS NO RIM DAMAGE AND PROPER TIRE PRESSURES HAVE BEEN MAINTAINED. THE CAR HAS NOT BEEN OPERATED OFF ROAD. I'M CAUGHT BETWEEN AUDI WHICH TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TIRES ON THEIR CARS AND GOODYEAR. I HAVE NEVER HAD TIRE FAILURES ON ANY OF THE OTHER 5 CARS WE OWN AND CONTINUE TO BE SURE THAT THIS MUST BE A COMMON PROBLEM CAUSED BY WEAK SIDE WALLS.",
