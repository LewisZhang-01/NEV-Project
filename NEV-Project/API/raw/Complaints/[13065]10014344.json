I WAS DRIVING DOWN U.S. HIGHWAY 75 IN TRAFFIC WHEN SOMEONE CUTTING ME OFF CAUSED ME TO STEP HARD ONTO MY BRAKES.  BECAUSE THIS PART WAS DEFECTIVE IT CAUSED MY TRUCK TO MAKE A COMPLETE TURN AROUND BECAUSE ALL 4 WHEELS LOCKED UP.  I BELIEVE MY TRUCK WOULD HAVE MADE A SAFE STOP IF THE ABS HAD BEEN WORKING.  THIS INCIDENT DIDN'T CAUSE  THE ABS FAILURE.  THE COST OF THIS SAFETY PRODUCT IS HIGH AND I CAN'T AFFORD TO FIX IT BUT I BELIEVE IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO.  I CONTACTED RELIABLE CHEVROLET AND THEY SAID THEY HAD HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH OTHER TRUCKS.   *NLM",
