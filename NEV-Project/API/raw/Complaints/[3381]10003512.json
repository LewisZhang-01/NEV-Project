THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN RECALLED ON 93 AND 94 MODELS, AND CHRYSLER REFUSES TO ADMIT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH 95 MODELS.  EVEN THOUGH ALLDATA.COM STATES THAT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN FOUND ON 93 AND 94 MODELS THE SAME DAY THAT IT HAS BEEN FOUND ON 95 MODELS, STILL THERE IS NO RECALL.  THE PART WAS ON BACKORDER FOR 9 MONTHS, STILL NO RECALL, HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM, AND IF SOMEONE HAS THIS PROBLEM AND GETS INTO AN ACCIDENT, THE POSSIBILITY OF A FATAL INJURY HAS TO BE GREATLY INCREASED.  WHY WON'T CHRYSLER ADMIT THIS?  THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE BOTTOM BRACKET POWER DRIVERS SIDE SEAT.",
