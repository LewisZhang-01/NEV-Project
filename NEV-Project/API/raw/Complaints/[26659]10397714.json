THE HANDLES AND THE SUPPORTING DOOR FRAMES ARE ALL CRACKING IN THE SAME LOCATION AND THE HANDLES THEN FALL OFF. THE MANUFACTURER HAS BEEN UNWILLING TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ISSUE. THEY DECLINED MY CLAIM WITH MY 100,000 MILE 7 YEAR MAXIMUM CARE UPGRADE EXTENDED WARRANTY.  AT FIRST THEY OFFERED (THEN RETRACTED) A GOODWILL GESTURE OF COVERING ALL BUT $500 FOR THE REPLACEMENT. THEY DO NOT CONSIDER THIS A SAFETY ISSUE! THIS IS AN UNACCEPTABLE SAFETY HAZARD. I HOPE YOU WILL ADDRESS AS A RECALL BEFORE SOMEONE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED BECAUSE THEY CANNOT GET OUT OF THE VEHICLE.",
