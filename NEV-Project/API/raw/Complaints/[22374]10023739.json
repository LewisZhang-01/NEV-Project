SINCE THIS IS NOT CONSIDER A DEFECT OR A PROBLEM BY HONDA, THEY OFFERED ME A FREE OIL CHANGE AS A \"GOOD WILL\".  THIS CAR IS COSTING ME OVER $27,000, HONDA CAN CALL THIS NOISE ANYWAY THEY WANT, BUT I DID NOT BUY A CAR TO HAVE SOME NOISE AFTER ONLY 4 MONTHS OF HAVING THE CAR, THEY ALSO ADMIT IS A PROBLEM IN THE BULLETIN WHEN THEY SAY \"CHARACTERISTIC PROBLEM\", THE HONEST THING FROM HONDA SINCE THEY KNEW THIS SINCE DECEMBER 2002 AND I BOUGHT THE CAR IN FEBRUARY 2003, SHOULD HAVE BEEN TO INFORM ME ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING THIS NOISE IN THE CAR, AND I WOULD HAVE MADE THE DECISION OF NOT BUYING THE CAR, I HAVE BEEN TO TWO DEALERS, CALLED HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE 3 TIMES AND I HAVE ONLY BEEN OFFERED A FREE OIL CHANGE, I HOPE THIS AGENCY CAN HELP ME TO DEAL WITH HONDA, I KNOW THIS MAY NOT BE A SAFETY ISSUE BUT I DON'T THINK HONDA SHOULD GET AWAY WITH HIDING INFORMATION FROM POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND THEN WHEN THEY GET CALLED JUST ACT LIKE THERE IS NO PROBLEM.  THANKS, ML I ONLY SEE REPORT DEFECTIVE EQUIPMENT THAT WAS INCLUDED WITH THE VEHICLE AT TIME OF PURCHASE BUT THIS NOISE WASN'T THERE WHEN I PURCHASE THE CAR.   *NLM",
