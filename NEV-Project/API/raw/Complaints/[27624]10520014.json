HE PULLED OVER TO CHECK ALL OF THE FLUIDS AND EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE FINE. WHEN I GOT HOME I RESEARCHED THE ISSUES AND ABOUT 99% OF 2001 SEBRING CONVERTIBLE OWNERS EXPERIENCED THE SAME ENGINE PROBLEMS AND IT STATED THAT IT WAS DUE TO OIL SLUDGE. I CALLED CHRYSLER AND INFORMED THEM OF THE ISSUE AND WAS TOLD TO TAKE THE CAR THE A DEALERSHIP NEAR ME. I WAS ABLE TO ENJOY MY CAR FOR ABOUT 2 DAYS. THEY WILL CONTINUE HEARING FROM ME FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE I AM A PERSON THAT NEVER GIVES UP. I WILL PESTER THEM EVERYDAY UNTIL MY DEMANDS ARE MET WITH FIXING OR REPLACING MY ENGINE. IT IS NOT ANYONE'S FAULT THAT THEY MADE A CRAPPY ENGINE FOR THIS MODEL. LET THE GAMES BEGIN.  *TR",
