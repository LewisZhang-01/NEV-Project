I HAD TO PUT THE VEHICLE IN NEUTRAL AND FIND A PLACE TO PULL OVER.  I HELD MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE TO TRY TO SLOW DOWN, BUT THIS ONLY CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO FISHTAIL.  I FINALLY MADE IT TO A GRAVEL DRIVEWAY AND PUT IT IN PARK, BUT THE ACCELERATOR STAYED ON THE FLOOR CAUSING MY TIRE TO SPIN THROWING GRAVEL AND THEN THEY BEGAN TO SMOKE.  I KILLED THE ENGINE AND HAD TO CALL ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE TO BE TOWED TO THE LOCAL DEALER.  ACCELERATOR NEVER LIFTED BACK TO NORMAL POSITION.  CAR IS CURRENTLY BEING CHECKED AT THE FORD DEALERSHIP.  *JB",
