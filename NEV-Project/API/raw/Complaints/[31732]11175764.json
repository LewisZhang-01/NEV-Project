        "summary": "ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL THIS MORNING (2/8/2019), MY 11 YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER MENTIONED HER SEAT BELT BROKE (REAR DRIVER SEAT). SHE MOVED TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BACKSEAT (REAR PASSENGER SEAT). ONCE WE WERE STOPPED, I REALIZED WHAT SHE MEANT BY BROKEN: THE SEAT BELT HAD COMPLETELY FRAYED, BROKE COMPLETELY AND PULLED APART FROM IT'S INTERNAL HOUSING. UPON FURTHER INSPECTION, ALL THREE SEAT BELTS IN THE BACK SEAT HAVE FRAYING. THE ONE SHE MOSTLY USED WAS COMPLETELY BROKEN. THE REAR PASSENGER SEAT BELT IS NOT USED AS OFTEN SO THE FRAY/CUT IS ABOUT 1/3 OF THE WIDTH OF THE SEAT BELT. THE REAR MIDDLE SEAT HAS THE LEAST DAMAGE, BUT IS STILL FRAYED/CUT. NO ONE CAN NOW SIT IN THE BACK SEAT WITH FAULTY SEAT BELTS. THE HOUSING SEEMS EXCESSIVELY SHARP AND THAT'S WHAT IS CAUSING THEM TO BE CUT. I CALLED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THE DEALER ASKING FOR A MANAGER, BUT AS OF SUBMITTING THIS, I HAVEN'T RECEIVED A RETURN CALL.",
