ALTHOUGH I COULD FIND NO RECALL ISSUED ABOUT SRS UNITS IN HONDA'S, I DID FIND 47 COMPLAINTS FILED WITH NHTSA(NOT COUNTING MINE). I DIDN'T INCLUDE NUMEROUS REPORTS OF FAILURE TO DEPLOY AIRBAGS, AIRBAGS DEPLOYING W/O CAUSE AND AIRBAGS DEPLOYING W/O INFLATING.           I FIND IT VERY DISHEARTENING THAT A COMPANY SUCH AS HONDA WOULD HIDE A OBVIOUSLY DANGEROUS SAFETY DEFECT FROM IT'S CONSUMERS.",
