CONTACTED A COUPLE OF FORD DEALERSHIP WHO INFORMED ME THAT THEY DO NOT AND CANNOT FIX THIS PROBLEM AND I WAS REFERRED TO A LOCAL SPEED TEST SHOP. THE VEHICLE WAS TESTED ON A CERTIFIED MACHINE, THE TEST RESULTS WERE AS FOLLOWS (SPEEDOMETER INDICATION/ACTUAL VEHICLE SPEED):  25/30  30/37  35/43   40/50  45/54  50/60  55/66  60/72  65/80  ALSO, THE ODOMETER REGISTERS 95 MILES FOR EVERY 100 MILES TRAVELED.  THE VEHICLE HAS ABOUT 103,000 MILES ON IT, AND THE MALFUNCTION HAS CAUSED FINANCIAL PROBLEMS (SPEED VIOLATION) AS WELL AS ENDANGERING SELF AND OTHERS WITHOUT EVEN BEING AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THE CAR IS TRAVELING AT DANGEROUS SPEEDS, ESPECIALLY ON 65 MPH AND 70 MPH EXPRESSWAYS.  THE TEST SHOP INFORMED ME THAT THE SPEED DIFFERENTIAL INCREASES AT HIGHER SPEEDS AND COULD RESULT IN SPEEDS WAY OVER 30 MPH ABOVE THE SPEEDOMETER INDICATION.*JB",
