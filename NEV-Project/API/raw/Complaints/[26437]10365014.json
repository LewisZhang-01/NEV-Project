SHE WENT DOWN TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON. AS SHE WAS WALKING THROUGH OUR KITCHEN SHE SMELLED SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT RIGHT. SHE WOKE ME UP AND WE ALL LEFT THE HOUSE AND WENT TO HER PARENTS HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET. WE CALLED THE GAS COMPANY AND THEY CAME TO SEARCH THE HOUSE.  THE COULD NOT FIND A GAS LEAK, SO THE GUY FROM THE GAS COMPANY ASKED TO LOOK IN THE GARAGE. WHEN WE OPENED THE GARAGE IT FELT LIKE 100 DEGREES. WE LOOKED IN BOTH CARS AND THERE WERE NO KEYS IN THE IGNITION. WE POPPED THE HOODS ON THE CARS ON OUR ESCAPE YOU COULD BARELY TOUCH ANYTHING INSIDE THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT BECAUSE IT WAS HOT. ON OUR OTHER CAR YOU COULD TOUCH EVERYTHING. WE TRIED TO BACK THE ESCAPE OUT OF THE GARAGE UNTIL WE COULD GET IT TO THE DEALERSHIP THE NEXT DAY BUT WERE UNABLE TO. THE NEXT MORNING WE ENDED UP CALLING TO HAVE IT TOWED TO THE DEALER SHIP. THEY CHECKED THE WIRING UNDER THE BATTERY BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD COMPLAINTS OF THE STARTER SPINNING BUT NEVER STARTING.  SINCE THEN THEY AS WELL AS FORD HAVE SAID WE HAVE MADE THIS UP AND ARE UNWILLING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE SITUATION BECAUSE THEY HAVE NEVER HERD OF SUCH OF A THING.  SINCE WE ARE THE FIRST THEY DON'T FEEL OBLIGATED TO DO ANYTHING TILL SOMEONE GETS HURT OR DIES. *TR",
