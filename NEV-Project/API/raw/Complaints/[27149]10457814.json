        "summary": "COMING TO A STOP BEHIND A LINE OF CARS (NOT TOO LONG AFTER SUBURBAN PURCHASED) & BRAKE PEDAL STARTED GIVING RESISTANCE & MAKING NOISE (GROWLING-LIKE/PUSHING BACK) & DID NOT WANT TO STOP. HAD ALMOST CONSTANT TROUBLE W/ IT AFTER THAT, ESPECIALLY IN COLD & WET CONDITIONS & WE LIVE IN THE NORTHWEST, SO THIS IS HAPPENS A LOT! COUPLE OF TIMES, ALMOST SLID OFF OF ROADWAY OR INTO BACK OF PEOPLE, EVEN W/ MORE THAN ENOUGH STOPPING DISTANCE. BEFORE WE BOUGHT VEHICLE (WE HAVE GONE LESS THEN 5K MI) SEVERAL BRAKE COMPONENTS WERE CHANGED (PADS/DRUMS/ROTORS/CALIPERS, ALL PARTS MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE) & BRAKES WERE CONSTANTLY BEING CHECKED OUT, SO THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE, NOT JUST W/ OUR 96 SUBURBAN, OTHER SURBURBANS HAVE HAD ISSUES AS WELL, OF ALL YEARS. TOOK OUT ABS FUSE AND BRAKE SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE WORKING BETTER, BUT THIS IS NOT A PERMANENT FIX. MECHANICS CAN NEVER FIND ANYTHING WRONG AND THERE OBVIOUSLY IS (ABS LIGHT ALWAYS ON & BRAKE LIGHT ONCE FUSE IS PULLED). SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE PEOPLE GET SERIOUSLY INJURED OR EVEN DIE! THESE TRUCKS ARE WAY TOO BIG NOT TO BE ABLE TO STOP.  *TR",
