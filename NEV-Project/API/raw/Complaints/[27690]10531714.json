        "summary": "THIS HAS HAPPENED A NUMBER OF TIMES BEFORE.  WE WERE DRIVING AT NIGHT ABOUT 11:00 P.M. AND THE HEADLIGHTS WERE WORKING FINE.  SUDDENLY, BOTH HEADLIGHTS WENT OUT.  I SLOWED THE CAR AND TURNED THE HEADLIGHTS OFF AND TURNED THEM BACK ON AGAIN VERY QUICKLY.  NO PROBLEM THE REST OF THE WAY HOME.  SOMETIMES THE LIGHTS WOULD DIM AND I WAS NOT SURE IF THEY WERE ON OR NOT AND WOULD SHUT THEM OFF AGAIN AND THEN ON AGAIN.  SOMETIMES OTHER DRIVERS WOULD SIGNAL ME THAT THE HEADLIGHTS WERE NOT WORKING AND I WOULD TURN THEM OFF AND THEN ON AGAIN AND THEY WOULD BOTH BE LIT.  BUT OFTEN WHEN THERE IS STILL AMBIENT LIGHT AS ON A CITY STREET OR LOTS OF OTHER CARS, I WOULD NOT BE AWARE THAT THEY WERE OFF UNTIL I HIT A DARK SECTION OF ROAD.  I WENT TO TOYOTA YESTERDAY AND THE REPLACED BOTH BULBS.  THIS HAPPENED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND I BECAME AWARE OF IT BECAUSE I WAS FOLLOWING MY SON IN LAW IN HIS CAR AND HE SAID THAT I HAD NO LIGHTS.  VERY SCARY.  I DID THE SAME THING THEN AND TURNED THEM OFF  AND ON AGAIN.  *TR",
