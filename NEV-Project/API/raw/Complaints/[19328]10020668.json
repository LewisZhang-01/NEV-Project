SHE LOST CONTROL OF THE VAN AFTER THE LINKAGE FELL OFF.  SHE BARELY HAD TIME TO STOP BEFORE GOING THROUGH A FENCE.    I AM AN ENGINEER.  IT WOULD SEEM THAT STEERING LINKAGE WOULD BE COMPRISED OF COMPONENTS WITH AN INSIGNIFICANT RISK OF FAILURE.     WE DO NOT TRUST THE VAN ANYMORE.  IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO MY FAMILY IF THEY WERE ON THE FREEWAY WHEN THE LINKAGE FELL OFF.",
