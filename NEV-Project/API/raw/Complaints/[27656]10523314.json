I PUT ON MY HAZARD LIGHTS AND WAS ABLE TO GET OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AS OTHER CARS WERE FLYING BY ME ON BOTH SIDES.  ALL THE ELECTRICAL FUNCTIONS WERE STILL ON BUT THE WRENCH LIGHT CAME ON.  I SHUT THE CAR OFF AND RESTARTED IT AND THE LIGHT WENT OUT AND I WENT ON MY WAY.  THERE WAS NO WARNING.  IT HAPPENED 2 MORE TIMES ABOUT A MONTH A PART EACH TIME AND ALWAYS AFTER I HAD BEEN ON THE ROAD FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES.  AFTER THE THIRD TIME I TOOK IT TO THE FORD DEALERSHIP AND HAD TO WAIT OVER TWO WEEKS TO GET A NEW THROTTLE BODY.  PLEASE MAKE THEM RECALL THIS PART BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED! *TR",
