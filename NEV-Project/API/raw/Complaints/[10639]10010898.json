WHILE DRIVING THE CAR ON THE STREET OR THE HIGHWAY, IT IS TOO DIFFICULT TO SWITCH YOUR FEET FROM THE GAS PEDAL TO THE BREAK PEDAL. THE SHOE ITSELF, CAN GET STUCK BETWEEN THE GAS AND THE BREAK PEDAL CAUSING A SERIOUS CRASH. ALSO MY FEET AND  ANKLE CAN DEVELOP A SERIOUS PAIN AND INJURY CAUSING JOINT PAIN AND SOME BONE INJURIES. THEREFORE, DRIVER CAN'T REACT ON TIME TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT. *JB",
