        "summary": "I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF A 2008 DODGE RAM 2500 REGULAR CAB PICKUP AND THE VEHICLE HAS ONLY BEEN SERVICED AT CERTIFIED DODGE DEALERSHIPS.  THE VEHICLE CURRENTLY HAS 44900 MILES.  I HAVE BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN 3 TIMES TO HAVE THE FRONT LEFT TIE ROD REPLACED UNDER THE N62 TIE ROD RECALL WITH NO RESOLUTION.   THE TIE ROD IS FAILING CONFIRMED BY THE DEALER AND MYSELF, THE VEHICLE IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE, AND THE DEALER AND CHRYSLER REFUSE TO REPLACE THE FAULTY COMPONENT AS THEY ARE SAYING THE RECALL DOES NOT AFFECT MY VEHICLE.  DUE TO CHRYSLER AND THE SELLING DEALER NOT KEEPING APPROPRIATE RECORDS OF THE REPAIRS DONE ON THE VEHICLE THEY HAVE INACCURATE RECALL INFORMATION AND ARE REFUSING TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM, AS THEY ARE STATING THE VEHICLE HAS ORIGINAL OEM EQUIPMENT WHICH IS FALSE.   AT 26953 MILES I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE INTO THE ORIGINAL SELLING DEALER VICTORY CHRYSLER IN ROME, NY ON MARCH 22, 2011 DUE TO DRIVABILITY CONCERNS, WANDERING, AND LOOSE FRONT END COMPONENTS PRIOR TO THE DATE THE N62 RECALL ISSUED.  NOTED ON THE REPAIR INVOICE FROM THE SELLING DEALER \"REPLACED THE TIE ROD END - REPLACE TO PITMAN ARM (B) PARTS NUMBERS 68036940, ARM PART NUMBER 68039930AA, AND ARM STEERING GEAR/PITMAN PART NUMBER 19651001.BER 68039930AA, AND ARM STEERING GEAR/PITMAN PART NUMBER 19651001.   APPROXIMATELY 1 YEAR LATER I RECEIVED THE N62 RECALL INDICATING THAT TRUCKS THAT HAD STEERING LINKAGE REPLACED WITH MOPAR SERVICE PARTS AND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO HAVE THE VEHICLES FAULTY REPLACEMENT PART REPAIRED.  I CONTACTED VICTORY THE SELLING DEALER AND WAS ADVISED NO PARTS WERE AVAILABLE AND IT WOULD BE AT LEAST 3 WEEKS BEFORE THE VEHICLE COULD BE SERVICED.  I WAS ABLE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT AT A ANOTHER RAM DEALER CARBONE DODGE IN YORKVILLE, NY.  IT WAS CONFIRMED BY THE DEALER THE TIE ROD NEEDS REPLACEMENT BUT NO REPAIR WAS COMPLETED DUE TO THE RECORDS BEING INACCURATE FROM CHRYSLER.",
