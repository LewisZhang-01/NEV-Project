SHE WAS DRIVING BETWEEN 30 AND 40MPH WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE VEHICLE DID NOT SLOW DOWN WHEN LETTING OFF THE GAS PEDAL, INSTEAD IT SPED UP AFTER LETTING OFF OF THE GAS PEDAL.  SHE TRIED THE BRAKES, THEY GRABBED, BUT THE VEHICLE STILL CONTINUED TO SPEED UP.  SHE THEN APPLIED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, AGAIN, THE VEHICLE DID NOT SLOW DOWN.  FINALLY SHE PUT THE TRANSMISSION INTO PARK AND THE VEHICLE CONTINUED TO MOVE UNTIL SHE TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE.  I FEEL LIKE THIS NEEDS TO BE REPORTED TO SOMEONE, TO MAKE MY WIFE AND MYSELF FEEL THAT WE DID OUR PART BY REPORTING SUCH AN UNACCEPTABLE OCCURANCE.",
