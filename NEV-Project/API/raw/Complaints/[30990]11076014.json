COULDN'T DRIVE FOR FEAR OF MY ENGINE OVERHEATING AND HAD TO GET IT TOWED!! IT WAS ONLY AT 37,00 MILES!  FROM THIS LINK TO A FORUM IT APPEARS VERY MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUES AT VERY LOW MILES!    HTTP://WWW.JEEPRENEGADEFORUM.COM/FORUM/434-PROBLEMS-ISSUES/68882-RADIATOR-COOLING-FAN-ISSUE-THREAD-6.HTML#/TOPICS/68882?PAGE=5  SEEMS LIKE THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THIS BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE A VERY COMMON PROBLEM! THIS IS JUST ONE PAGE OUT OF MANY PAGES OF THE FORUM. THE ENGINE STARTED OVERHEATING WHEN I WAS IN IDLE, BUT I AM NOT SURE WHEN THE FAN ACTUALLY BROKE. IT HAD MADE A RATTLING SOUND DURING IDLE THE DAY BEFORE IT BROKE.",
