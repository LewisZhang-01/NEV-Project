I HAVE BEEN A CHRYSLER CUSTOMER FOR DECADES, BUT HAVING A CAR THAT RUNS FINE FOR 55K AND THEN DIES BY 60K WILL MAKE ME BUY FOREIGN  HOW MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE OIL LEAKS WILL IT TAKE TO GET A RECALL? (I HOPE I ADD TO THIS COUNT)  MAYBE IF I GET THE NEXT STAGE, AN ENGINE FIRE, AT LEAST THE INSURANCE MIGHT HELP PAY FOR MY TOYOTA...*JB",
