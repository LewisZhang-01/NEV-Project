        "summary": "IN OCTOBER 2001 (AT 67000 MILES), COOLANT WAS LEAKING FROM THE WATER PUMP ON MY 1997 2.5-LITER V6 FORD CONTOUR.  WATER PUMP WAS REPLACED.  ON JUNE 2002 (AT 73000 MILES), THE WATER PUMP STARTED LEAKING AGAIN.  WATER PUMP WAS REPLACED AGAIN.  ON DECEMBER 2002 (AT 80000 MILES), THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN, I.E. THE PUMP WAS LEAKING.  WATER PUMP WAS REPLACED.  ON APRIL 2003 (AT 85000 MILES), THE WATER PUMP AGAIN BEGAN TO LEAK FROM AROUND THE SAME SPOT (PER THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN).  WATER PUMP WAS REPLACED.  WITH THIS LATEST OCCURRENCE THE FORD DEALERSHIP TECHNICIAN (@ CENTURY FORD IN ROCKVILLE, MD) CALLED FORD HOTLINE WITH THE HISTORY OF THE PROBLEMS.  THE HOT LINE CALLED BACK LATER AND INFORMED THE TECHNICIAN THAT THEY HAD DISCOVERED THAT THE FIBER MATERIAL FROM INSIDE THE RADIATOR HOSE WAS SHREDDING, WITH THE END RESULT BEING THAT THE PARTICLES WOULD FLOW INTO THE WATER PUMP AND RUIN THE SEALS, THUS NECESSITATING CHANGING THE WATER PUMP.    NO FORD TECHNICAL BULLETIN EXISTS ON DEFECTIVE RADIATOR HOSE.  AT NO TIME DID DEALERSHIP RECOMMEND THAT RADIATOR HOSE BE REPLACED BECAUSE IT WAS DEFECTIVE OR BECAUSE IT LOOKED WORN OUT.  *JB",
