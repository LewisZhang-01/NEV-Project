IT ACTUALLY WORKED FOR A FEW WEEKS INTERMITTENTLY THEN QUIT AGAIN.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND CANNOT GET A PASSED INSPECTION WITHOUT THE HORN WORKING.  I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH TOYOTA A YEAR AGO AND THEY WOULD NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY.  I AM RETIRED, CANNOT AFFORD TO TAKE IT TO A DEALERSHIP WITHOUT FEARING IT WILL COST ME AN ARM AND A LEG.  IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO?  ALL TOYOTA WANTS TO DO IS SELL ME A NEW VEHICLE. MY VEHICLE IS PAID OFF.  THE DATE I HAVE SUBMITTED IS AN APPROXIMATE DATE WHEN I HAD IT LOOKED AT. THANK YOU.",
