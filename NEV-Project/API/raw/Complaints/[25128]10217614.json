ALSO I HAVE REPLACED ALL FOUR BRAKE ROTORS AT MY OWN EXPENSE. THIS FAILURE TO STOP HAS NEARLY CAUSED TWO ACCIDENTS. ON ONE OCCASION THE VEHICLE ONLY STOPPED AFTER RUNNING INTO A CHAIN STRETCHED ACROSS A DRIVEWAY,THIS RESULTED IN SOME MINOR DAMAGE TO THE FRONT GRILL. I TEMPORARILY DISABLED THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM BY REMOVING THE FUSE, BUT THIS DISABLES THE CRUISE CONTROL AS WELL. IT IS VERY MUCH A MATTER OF SAFETY THAT THE TRUCK STOPS WHEN IT IS SUPPOSED TO.  *TR",
