        "summary": "CONDENSATION BUILDS UP ON THE INSIDE OF ALL WINDOWS OF VEHICLE WHILE PARKED FOR 6 HOURS. SO MUCH SO, CONDENSATION WAS RUNNING DOWN THE INSIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD.   THIS PROBLEM IS UNUSUAL AS I''VE OWNED NUMEROUS NEW VEHICLES IN THIS GEOGRAPHICAL AREA. AND NONE HAS HAD THIS AMOUNT IF ANY CONDENSATION BUILD UP ON THE INSIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD. AS I''M NOT SURE IF THIS IS A VALID COMPLAINT. BECAUSE YES AFTER ABOUT 10 MINUTES OF RUNNING THE DEFROSTER THE CONDENSATION CLEARS. BUT I CAN''T IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE WENT BELOW FREEZING. WOULD I HAVE A SHEET OF ICE ON THE INSIDE OF MY WINDSHIELD? THIS IS A BRAND NEW VEHICLE; THERE SHOULDN''T BE ANY FROST ON THE INSIDE OF THE WINDOWS.  I WILL CONTACT THE DEALER TO SEE IF THEY''VE HAD ANY COMPLAINTS OF THIS NATURE OR IF THEY HAVE ANY IDEAS OF THE CAUSE. ALSO THIS HAPPENED IN 2003, THAT YEAR SELECTION WASN''T AVAILABLE VIA YOUR WEB SITE UNDER INCIDENT DATE.  THANKS",
