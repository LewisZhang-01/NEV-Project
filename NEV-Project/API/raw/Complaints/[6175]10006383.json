THIS PROBLEM LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT I MAY HAVE A PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE WHENEVER I NEED TO BRAKE FAST OR UPON MOVING AFTER BEING STOPPED AS THE SEAT ROCKS BACKWARDS. NOW I HAVE CONTACTED THE MANUFACTURE AS TO RECALL WITH NO ASSIST.  I BELIEVE THIS TO BE A HAZARD IN THE SEAT ITSELF.  THANK YOU.     *JB      ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS***739541",
