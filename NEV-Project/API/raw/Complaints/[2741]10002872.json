COOLANT HAS LEAKED INTO THE #4 CYLINDER.  THE DEALER WANTS $3500-4500 TO PUT A NEW ENGINE IN IT.  THE HEAD GASKET LEAKING IS  A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH WINDSTARS.  FORD HAS HAS A PROGRAM FOR EARLIER MODELS TO REPLACE THE ENGINE.  BUT FORD HAS YET TO APPLY THE PROGRAM TO THE 1998 MODELS.  I EXPECT A FORD VEHICLE TO GET AT LEAST 180,000 MILES WHEN THE OWNER HAS ALL RECOMMENDED MAINTENANCE COMPLETED.  I WANT FORD TO PAY FOR A NEW ENGINE! I WAS TO PUT ANOTHER 100,000 MILES ON THAT VAN.",
