AUDI (MANUFACTURER) HAS REPLACED HORN UNDER WARRANTY EACH TIME, AND REIMBURSED ME FOR THE REPLACEMENT ONE TIME (OUT OF WARRANTY). I JUST DISCOVERED THAT THERE WAS A RECALL FOR SOME VINS FOR MY CAR (1996 AUDI A4 QUATTRO) FOR THE EXACT PROBLEM I HAVE BEEN HAVING. RECALL IS 96V088000. BUT MANUFACTURER CLAIMS THAT THE RECALL DOESN'T COVER MY CAR. OBVIOUSLY IS SHOULD, SINCE I AM SUFFERING (HAVE BEEN SUFFERING) FROM THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM FOR 6 YEARS. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO EXPAND THIS RECALL TO CARS THROUGH, AT LEAST, MY VIN, AS THE RECALL ISN'T WIDE ENOUGH. TS",
