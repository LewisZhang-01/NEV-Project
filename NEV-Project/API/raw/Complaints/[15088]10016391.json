THE JEEP WAS TAKEN IN AND \"ROTORS WERE ADJUSTED.\"  THIS TOOK CARE OF THE PROBLEM UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 48000 MILES WHERE THE DEALER REPORTED AN \"ENGINEERING DEFECT\" WITH THE BRAKE SYSTEM AND THAT A TEMPORARY FIX FOR $129.00 COULD BE DONE, BUT THEY SAID I WOULD BE BACK IN AFTER 10,000 MILES SO I FELT I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO HAVE THEM INSTALL THE NEW CALIPER, BRAKE AND ROTOR SYSTEM FOR A COST TO ME OF $420.00.  THE BRAKE PADS WERE NOT WORN AND THESE MILES WERE HIGHWAY MILES.  THIS CALIPER/ROTOR SYSTEM SHOULD BE RECALLED DUE TO THE DESIGN DEFECT AND NOT CHARGED TO THE CONSUMER. *JB",
