JUST OUT OF OHIO WE EXPERIENCED AN IRITATING, HAND-NUMBING VIBRATION ON THE STEERING WHEEL.  WE MANAGED TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECT BY DRIVING UNDER 75MPH.  AFTER 3000 MILES AND FIVE DAYS OF DRIVING, WE LOST THE POWER STEERING ON THE FIRST DAY IN LAS VEGAS.  THE GOODYEAR SERVICE CENTER REPLACED THE POWER STEERING PUMP AND THE RACK AND PINION.  THEY FURTHER POINTED OUT THAT THE TIRES WERE BADLY DEFORMED, AND THAT THEY WERE PRIMARELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAMAGE TO OUR VEHICLE.  TWO OF THE TIRES WERE IMMEDIATELY REPLACED WITHOUT QUESTION AT THE LOCAL WAL-MART (THEY WERE PURCHASED AT WAL-MART IN CLEVELAND).  I POINT OUT THAT OUR VEHICLE WAS INSPECTED THREE DAYS BEFORE THE TRIP BEGAN AS PRECAUTION AND PREPARATION FOR THE TRIP(COST OF INSPECTION AND MINOR REPAIRS WAS $600.OO).  TIRE BALANCE AND ALIGNMENT WAS REPORTED TO BE IN PERFECT CONDITION.",
