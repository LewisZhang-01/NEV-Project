THE VEHICLE IS A  4 CYCLINDER 2002 VW PASSAST WITH 5200 MILES WHICH I PURCHASED IN JUNE OF THIS YEAR.  I HAD IT TOWED TO FAIRFAX VW IN FAIRFAX, VA ON 12-22-02.  THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER ADVISED ME THAT HE HAD TOWED A NUMBER OF PASSATS OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS THAT HAD BURNED OUT COIL PACKS.  THE CAR WAS REPAIRED ON 12-23-02 AND 2 OF THE 4 COIL PACKS HAD BURNED OUT.  I WAS TOLD THAT VW WAS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM.  I ASKED THE DEALER WHY THE OTHER 2 COIL PACKS WERE NOT REPLACED AND THEY ADVISED ME THAT VW WILL ONLY APPROVE THE REPLACEMENT OF THE BURNED OUT ONES.  I FEEL THAT IF VW IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM THAT ALL OF THE COIL PACKS SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED SINCE THE OTHER TWO MAY EVENTUALLY BURN OUT, TOO.  THIS COULD CAUSE SEVERE MECHANICAL DAMAGE IF THE VEHICLE IS DRIVEN UNDER THESE CONDITIONS.",
