THE ENGINE AND TURBO SEEM TO STALL OUT UNTIL I LET OFF THE GAS AND REAPPLY.  DUE TO THE SPORADIC NATURE OF THIS, THE DEALER CAN NOT RECREATE.  I BELIEVE THIS TO BE VERY DANGEROUS, WHEN MERGING ON A FREEWAY I EXPECT MY CAR TO PROVIDE CONTINUOUS ACCELERATION, NOT TO STALL OUT. GIVEN THE NATURE OF HONOLULU'S FREEWAY, IT IS MOST IMPORTANT TO HAVE FULL POWER DUE TO THE SHORTNESS OF THE ON RAMPS.  I HAVE ALWAYS USED PREMIUM GAS AS REQUIRED BY VW, AND HAD THE FUEL INJECTORS CLEANED BY A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED AUTO SERVICE CHAIN, TO MAKE SURE I DID NOT HAVE ANY \"BAD GAS\" DEPOSITS.  THIS STILL HAS NOT FIXED THE PROBLEM.  I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY ADVICE OR ASSISTANCE YOU CAN OFFER IN THIS MATTER.  RESPECTFULLY, JORDAN D. O'HEARN CTO1 USN.   *NLM",
