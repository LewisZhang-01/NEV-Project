        "summary": "TODAY, WHILE DRIVING AT ABOUT 55 MPH ON RTE 1, MY 1998 FORD TAURUS WAGON SUDDENLY STARTING TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY AS LOUD NOISES LIKE BOTTOMING OUT ON SEVERAL BOULDERS EMANATED FROM BENEATH THE CAR.  THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO RUN SMOOTHLY AND THE A/C PUMPED OUT COOL AIR, BUT WHEN THE CAR CAME TO REST AT A STOP LIGHT IT DID NOT MOVE FORWARD UNTIL THE RPM GOT QUITE HIGH AND ONLY THEN AT A VERY SLOW, HERKY, JERKY PACE.  THE CAR SMOOTHED OUT AT AROUND 25-30 MPH, BUT THE PROBLEM GOT PROGRESSIVELY WORSE.  I NOTICED BLUE-GRAY SMOKE COMING FROM THE REAR OF THE CAR AND PARKED THE CAR IN A RELATIVELY SAFE PLACE.  I NOTICED LIQUID DRIPPING FROM BENEATH THE CAR NEAR THE REAR OF THE OIL PAN.  MY HUSBAND CHECKED ON THE CAR ON HIS WAY HOME FROM WORK TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE LIQUID IS TRANSMISSION FLUID.  WITHOUT HUMOR I RECALLED A WOMAN TELLING ME JUST TWO WEEKS AGO THAT SHE HAD A CAR JUST LIKE MINE THAT SHE HAD TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION IN RECENTLY, AND I TOLD HER AT THE TIME THAT MY CAR WAS RUNNING FINE.  THIS FAILURE OCCURRED WITHOUT ANY WARNING.  IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT I WAS ON RTE 1 AND NOT ON I-95, AND IN THE DAY TIME ON A HOT SUNNY DAY AND NOT ON A COLD, WET NIGHT.   *NLM",
