PLEASE BEAR WITH ME AS THIS IS DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN CLEARLY WITHOUT ACTUALLY DEMINSTRATING EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN.  SINCE THE PURCHASE OF MY TRUCK THE STEERING WHEEL PAD (WHICH IS WERE THE HORN IS LOCATED) IS VERY STIFF/SOLID MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO \"USE\" OR \"SOUND\" MY HORN IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY.  I FEEL  IT'S A SAFETY HAZARD.  EVERY VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE EASY ACCESSIBITY AND USE OF HORN.     PLEASE CONTACT ME REGARDING THIS ISSUE.   THANK YOU.",
