THE VEHICLE HAD PREVIOUSLY GIVEN OFF AN ELECTRICAL BURNING SMELL 2 TIMES THAT WENT AWAY AFTER ONE MINUTE OR SO, AND AT A DIFFERENT TIME IT WAS DIFFICULT TO START AND IDLED ROUGHLY FOR ABOUT A MINUTE OR SO.  WE ARE WAITING TO SEE IF ALL THE COILS CAN BE REPLACED AT ONCE INSTEAD OF WAITING UNTIL THEY GO BAD OR CATCH FIRE.  GIVEN THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FOR THIS PROBLEM, WE CERTAINLY FEEL THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY VOLKSWAGEN IN A TIMELY FASHION AND HOPE THAT THEY WILL DO SO IN OUR CASE.
