ON ACTIVATING THE SWITCH TO OPERATE THE VENTS THERE IS NO AUTOMATIC CUTOFF AS SOON AS THE VENTS ARE OPENED / CLOSED ALL THE WAY.  THIS APPARENTLY LEADS TO THE MOTOR OVER-HEATING AND CAUSING IT TO BURN.  THERE ARE NO MANUAL CONTROLS AVAILABLE TO OPERATE THE VENTS.  BASED ON YOUR LOCATION THE VAN WILL NOW BE OVERHEATED (FL) OR EXTREMELY COLD (CO) AS THE INTERNAL A/C UNIT CANNOT / WILL NOT FUNCION AT THE OPTIMUM LEVELS. *TR",
