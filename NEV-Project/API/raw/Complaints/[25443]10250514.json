THIS COULD PRESENT A SERIOUS PROBLEM AS THE HOOD COULD SLAM DOWN UNTO ANYONE THAT MIGHT BE LOOKING UNDER THE HOOD. I LUCKILY AVOIDED GETTING INJURED THIS MORNING AS I WAS LOOKING UNDER THE HOOD, TURNED AROUND FOR A SECOND, AND THE HOOD SLAMMED SHUT, NARROWLY MISSING ME.    THERE IS A SIMILAR SITUATION WITH THE BACK WINDOW. ALTHOUGH NOT AS SERIOUS, THE CYLINDERS ON THE WINDOW ARE FAILING AS WELL. *TR",
