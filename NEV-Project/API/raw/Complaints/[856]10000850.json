WITHOUT THE DASH GAUGES, YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW FAST GOING, IF CRUISE IS ENGAGED, HOW MUCH GAS, THE TEMPERATURE OF ENGINE, ETC. TOOK TO DEALER AND THE PART THAT NEEDS REPLACING IS A METER ASSEMBLY CIRCUIT BOARD (PART # 83247-5A050-RP). AFTER RESEARCH, I FOUND THAT THE -RP OF THE PART NUMBER MEANS THE CIRCUIT BOARD HAS TO BE PROGRAMMED WITH MY CURRENT MILEAGE. FURTHER INVESTIGATION SHOWS THAT WHEN THE DASH IN NOT OPERATING, MY MILEAGE IS NOT BEING REGISTERED. I THINK IT IS POOR DESIGN TO STORE ODOMETER READING IN FLASH MEMORY (I HAVE VERIFIED THIS BY RECORDING ODOMETER READING WHEN DASH WAS OPERABLE. DROVE ABOUT 15 TO 20 MILES, WHEN DASH NOT OPERABLE, AND VERIFIED THAT THE ODOMETER HAD NOT REGISTERED THE MILEAGE). I HAVE GONE TO MANY LEXUS RELATED SITES (CLUBS, BULLETIN BOARDS, MESSAGE BOARDS) AND FOUND THIS TO BE QUITE PREVALENT.",
