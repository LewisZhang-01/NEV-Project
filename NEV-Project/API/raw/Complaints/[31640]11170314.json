FOUND THIS OUT WHEN DRIVING AROUND A BEND IN THE ROAD AND MY REAR PASSENGER SIDE DOOR FLEW OPEN.  THANKFULLY THERE WAS NO PASSENGER AS THEY COULD HAVE BEEN FLOWN OUT OF THE TRUCK.  THIS IS KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THESE FORD TRUCKS.  REFER TO FSA 18N03 WHICH IS A FIELD SERVICE ACTION BULLETIN.  WHY THEY ARE NOT RECALLING THESE VEHICLES IS A MYSTERY TO ME.  THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE.  I HAVE MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THE DEALER THAT I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE FROM.  THEY TELL ME THAT A TECHNICIAN NEEDS TO TAKE EACH DOOR APART AND APPLY SEALANTS AND LUBRICATION TO THE PARTS.  IN SEARCHING OUT THIS PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET, OTHER OWNERS WHO ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM HAVE COMPLAINED THAT THE DEALER FIX DOES NOT WORK..THAT THE PROBLEM REOCCURS.  I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS PROBLEM IS NOT BEING ADDRESSED BY THE MANUFACTURER.  I PAID OVER 80K FOR THIS TRUCK AND I'M DRIVING AROUND IN A SAFETY HAZARD.",
