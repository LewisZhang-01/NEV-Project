THE SEATBELT RETRACTOR WILL ALSO LOCK WHEN THE BELT IS FULLY RETRACTED AND CAN REMAIN THIS WAY FOR DAYS.  SOMETIMES I HAVE HAD TO DRIVE WITH NO SEATBELT!  THE RETRACTOR WILL ALSO LOCK WHEN THE BELT IS WITHDRAWN.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS THE BELT HAS TO BE MANUALLY FED INTO THE BELT RETRACTOR.  I HAVE BEEN TO THE DEALERSHIP WITH MY PROBLEM AND THEY JUST TELL ME THAT I WILL HAVE TO PURCHASE A NEW BELT.  THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR ABOUT ONE YEAR.",
