        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 2002 SUBARU OUTBACK FROM OLDHAM'S SUBARU OF NICHOLASVILLE, KY IN FEBURARY 2003.  ON SAT. MARCH 22, 2003, I NOTICED THE CAR HESITATING DURING INITIAL ACCELERATION AFTER A STOP AND THEN WITH ACCELERATION AFTER SHIFTING INTO SECOND GEAR (MANUAL TRANSMISSION).  ON SUN., MARCH 23, 2003 THE PROBLEM BECAME MUCH MORE SEVERE.  THE CAR WOULD LURCH INTO INTERSECTIONS AFTER A STOP, AND THEN HESITATE.  THE CAR WOULD NOT MOVE AT ALL, THEN WOULD LURCH OUT OF THE INTERSECTION. THIS NEARLY CAUSED A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT, AND I HAD MY 2 YEAR OLD SON IN THE CAR.  I FINALLY DECIDED TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND CALL ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE.  THE CAR WAS TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP, WHO DROVE THE CAR THE NEXT TWO DAYS FOR 7 MILES, THEN 6 MILES, AND SAID THAT THEY FOUND NO PROBLEMS.  I PICKED UP THE CAR AND DID NOT HAVE THE PROBLEM FOR A WEEK, BUT I AM NOW HAVING THE SAME HESITATION PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR.  IT IS CLEARLY UNSAFE TO DRIVE, AND I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE IT.  MY OWN INVESTIGATION INTO THE PROBLEM (WEB RESEARCH) REVEALS THAT MANY OTHER OWNERS OF SUBARU'S MADE IN THE LATE 90'S TO THE PRESENT HAVE HAD SIMILAR PROBLEMS, WITH NO HELP FROM THEIR LOCAL DEALERSHIPS.  I HOPE THAT THIS PROBLEM CAN BE INVESTIGATED AND ADDRESSED BEFORE PEOPLE ARE INJURED OR KILLED.  *JB",
