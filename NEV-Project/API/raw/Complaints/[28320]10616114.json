I EXPLAINED TO THE LADY THAT ALL OF MY LIGHTS WILL GO OFF WHENEVER I GO OVER SPEED BUMPS INCLUDING SPEEDOMETER AND RADIO. WHEN ATTEMPTING TO START MY CAR I HAVE TO JIGGLE THE KEY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE IT WILL TURN AND I DO NOT HAVE ANY KEY RINGS WITH MY CAR KEY. THE LADY CLEARLY STATED THAT MY CAR IS HAVING THE IGNITION SWITCH ISSUES, BUT NOT BEING ON THE RECALL LIST I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND PAY FOR THIS OUT OF POCKET. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY MY SPECIFIC VIN WAS NOT ON THE RECALL LIST AND WHY I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS WHEN I WAS TOLD BY A CONTACT AT GM THAT MY CAR HAS THE ISSUE. I JUST WANT THIS FIXED. I HAVE HAD THIS CAR FOR A YEAR NOW AND IT HAS GIVEN ME NOTHING BUT ISSUES. I CAN'T SEE MY SPEED WHEN I DRIVE AT NIGHT WHICH I COULD GET A TICKET FOR AND IS DANGEROUS. WHO CAN I CONTACT TO BE ADDED TO THE RECALL LIST?   *TR",
