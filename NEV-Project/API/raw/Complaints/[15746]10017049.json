        "summary": "ON APRIL 15, 2003 I TOOK MY 1999 FORD CROWN VICTORIA (VIN [XXX]) TO THE BILL CURRIE FORD DEALERSHIP IN TAMPA, FLORIDA, FOR SERVICING. THE REAR BRAKE PADS WERE WORN OUT (2 MM REMAINING) WHILE THE FRONT BRAKE PAD WEAR WAS NORMAL (8 MM REMAINING).  THE ENTIRE BRAKING SYSTEM WAS CHECKED AND NO MALFUNCTION WAS DETECTED.  I NOTIFIED FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND RECEIVED NO VIABLE EXPLANATION FOR THE EXCESSIVE WEAR ON THE REAR BRAKES.  I NOTIFIED THE DEALERSHIP VIA EMAIL AS REQUESTED BY FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND RECEIVED ONLY AN AUTOMATED REPLY.  FORD MOTOR COMPANY INDICATED THAT MY REPORT TO THEM WOULD BE FORWARDED TO THEIR ENGINEERING DIVISION (I BELIEVE) BUT I HAVE RECEIVED NO FURTHER RESPONSE.  I AM VERY MUCH CONCERNED THAT THE VEHICLE HAS AN AS YET UNDETECTED BRAKING SYSTEM PROBLEM SINCE IT WOULD BE NORMAL FOR THE FRONT BRAKE PADS TO WERE OUT FIRST.  IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKING SYSTEM AND THAT PROBLEM ESCALATES, THEN ALL THE OCCUPANTS OF THE VEHICLE COULD BE IN JEOPARDY.            *JB      INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
