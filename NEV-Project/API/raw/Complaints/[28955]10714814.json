WHILE TRAVELING ALONG I-95 ON THE EAST COAST OF FLORIDA, MY JEEP (TWICE) SLIPPED GEAR AND APPEARED TO HAVE GONE INTO NEUTRAL.  IF YOU KNOW THE AREA, IT'S NOT THE IDEAL PLACE FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.  SINCE RETURNING TO THE WEST COAST OF FLORIDA, IT HAS HAPPENED ONCE.  I'VE TAKEN TO  A SHOP FOR A TUNE-UP AND TO CHECK ON THAT PROBLEM.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE 'FIX' DID NOT FIX IT AND I'M STILL EXPERIENCING JERKY SHIFTS AND GEAR FAILURE.  I'VE READ A NUMBER OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE SAME TYPE OF INCIDENTS ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE, BUT HAVE NOT LOCATED A FIX FOR THE PROBLEM.  WITHOUT HESITATION, I'LL SAY I'M TERRIFIED.  *TR",
