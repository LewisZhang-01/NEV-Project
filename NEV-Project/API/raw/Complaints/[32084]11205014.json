        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING MY CAR TO WORK, THE TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN SLIPPING OUT OF HEAR. THE SPEED WILL DECREASE AS I CAN'T ACCELERATE. THE RPM'S SHOOT UP BUT THE CAR WILL GO NOWHERE. IT HAS HAPPENED AND BOTH HIGH AND LOW SPEEDS BUT NORMALLY AFTER THE CAR ENGINE IS WARM. SOMETIMES WHEN IT HAPPENS, AFTER 10-15 SECONDS, THE GEAR WILL GO BACK TO DRIVE ON IT'S OWN AND I CAN CONTINUE ON MY WAY. LATELY, AS IT'S GOTTEN WORSE, THE CAR WILL COME TO A DEAD STOP (AS I CAN'T ACCELERATE) AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT I CAN DO TO GET IT BACK INTO GEAR. I HAVE TRIED TURNING THE CAR ON AND OFF, PUTTING IT IN NEUTRAL OR LOW AND IT CAN TAKE UP TO 20 MINUTES BEFORE I CAN GET THE VEHICLE DRIVING PROPERTY. AFTER RESEARCH, IT IS A COMMON ISSUE WITH THE VEHICLE HOWEVER AFTER TAKING THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP I PURCHASED IT FROM TWICE, THEY WILL NOT FIX IT. THEY STATE IT HASN'T HAPPENED DURING THEIR TEST DRIVE AND THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO AND THEY ARE RELEASING THE CAR TO ME. EVEN AFTER MULTIPLE PHONE CALLS AND ASKING THEM TO PERFORM OTHER TESTS- THEY WON'T. THEY HAVE ONLY RUN DIAGNOSTIC MACHINE TESTS AND DID A SHORT TEST DRIVE (EVEN THOUGH THEY LIED AND TOLD ME IT WAS LONGER). AFTER TAKING THE VEHICLE HOME YESTERDAY- IT HAPPENED TO ME TWICE TODAY. THIS IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE.",
