        "summary": "INITIAL INCIDENT: WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AT APPROXIMATELY 40MPH AND PRESSED THE GAS PEDAL TO LEVEL OUT SPEED.  WHEN I LIFTED MY FOOT OFF THE PEDAL, IT STUCK AND KEPT ACCELERATING.  I WAS ABLE TO RELEASE IT BY PRESSING THE PEDAL AGAIN.     SUBSEQUENT INCIDENTS: I HAD A FEW OTHER INCIDENTS, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY ONGOING, PENDING A MECHANIC LOOKING AT MY VEHICLE.  IN THESE INSTANCES, THEY ARE SIMILAR TO THE INITIAL ONE IN THAT WHEN I LET OFF THE PEDAL, IT STICKS AND EVENTUALLY RELEASES WITH A SLIGHT 'POP' FROM THE PEDAL AREA EITHER ON IT'S OWN, WHEN I PRESS THE GAS PEDAL AGAIN OR PRESS THE BRAKE AND SLOW TO A LOWER SPEED (AROUND 5MPH).    MAJOR INCIDENT: ON ONE OCCASION, THE PEDAL GOT STUCK AND THE RPM WENT UPWARDS OF 4000-5000 AND THE ENGINE WAS REVVING.  NONE OF THE ABOVE - PRESSING PEDAL OR PRESSING BRAKE - HELPED WITH THE SITUATION.  I EVENTUALLY HAD TO SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL AND TURN OFF THE VEHICLE.  WHEN I WAITED ABOUT 30 SECONDS, I RESTARTED THE VEHICLE AND IT WENT RIGHT BACK TO RPM AROUND 4000-5000.  I TRIED PRESSING THE PEDAL AGAIN TO RELASE AND AFTER 3 OR SO TRIES IT FINALLY RELEASED.    I AM PLANNING TO CONTACT FORD AND LET THEM KNOW I HAVE REPORTED THIS AND SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE.  *TR",
