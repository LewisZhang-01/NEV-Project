THERE IS A WHINING NOISE FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE WHEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT HIGH SPEEDS, SOMETIMES AT 55 MPH OR AT 75 MPH.  THE DEALER REPLACED THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL BEARING ON 4/22/03. THE  NOISE ON THE LEFT WENT AWAY. THE SAME NOISE SURFACED ON THE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CAR. ON 5/22/03 THE DEALER REPLACED THE RIGHT FRONT ENGINE MOUNT, THEY SAID IT WAS COMING APART. ONCE I DROVE THE CAR ON THE HIGHWAY AGAIN ON 5/29/03 THE NOISE WAS THERE. I ALSO STILL HEARD THE WHINNING NOISE FROM THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CAR AGAIN, BUT FOR JUST A COUPLE OF SECONDS. THE RIGHT SIDE WILL MAKE NOISE CONTINUOUSLY. NOW I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE DEALER AGAIN, WASTING MORE OF MY TIME, MONEY, AND EXTRA MILES ON MY CAR. I LIVE 130 MILES FROM THE NEAREST HYUNDAI DEALER. I HAVE OWNED THIS CAR FROM 4/08/03 AND THE CAR HAS 2400 MILES ON IT AND WILL NOW BE ON MY THIRD ATTEMPT TO HAVE THIS CAR REPAIRED.*AK",
