FRIEGHTLINER(AKA DAIMLER-CHRYLSER) SAY THAT IT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE, BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS THE GEAR SHIFT.  WELL, I AM SORRY,  THIS CONFUSION HAPPENS IN MANY CARS, BUT THE CONTROL ARM DOESN'T JUST BREAK OFF.  POOR DESIGN OR MATERIALS.  THIS HUMAN BEHAVIOR WILL NOT CHANGE, THIS ARM SHOULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO HANDLE THIS OCCASSIONAL CONFUSION.  THIS,HOWEVER, WAS NOT THE CASE WITH OUR TWO VEHICLES PURCHASED IN AUG, 2002.",
