ENGINE MADE A REVVING SOUND AND ALL POWER WAS LOST.  ALL FUELS LOOK GOOD AND THIS CAR HAS LESS THAN 20,000 MILES TOTAL BECAUSE IT WAS USED SPARINGLY BY PREVIOUS OWNER.  NO LIGHTS OR INDICATION GAVE WARNING THAT TRANSMISSION WOULD LOSE POWER.  WE ARE NOW SEEING ONLINE THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE.  I HAD PREVIOUSLY CALLED DEALER BUT KEPT GETTING HUNG UP ON.  I AM A WIDOW WITH CHILDREN AND DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO JUST TOW THE CAR TO BE FIXED AS THIS WAS OUR ONLY TRANSPORTATION WE HAVE BEEN LIMITED ON ACTUALLY TRAVELING TO THE DEALERSHIP SO THEY CAN CHECK RECALL INFORMATION FOR US.  *TR",
