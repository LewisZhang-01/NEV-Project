        "summary": "STEERING WHEEL HAS LOCKED UP ABOUT 10 OR 15 TIMES.  USUALLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER STARTING THE CAR.  IT HAS HAD ME STRANDED FOR ANYWHERE FROM 5-60 MINUTES.  TWO DEALERS HAVE LOOKED AT THE CAR AT LEAST 5 OR 6 TIMES.  I THOUGHT THE PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED UNTIL I WAS DRIVING TO WORK A FEW WEEKS AGO ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY AT A RATE OF SPEED OF ABOUT 65MPH WHEN THE DIGITAL DISPLAY ON THE COMPUTER SAID TO \"SERVICE STEERING COLUMN LOCK\".  THIS IS THE USUAL NOTIFICATION I GET ON MY CAR WHEN THE WHEEL HAS LOCKED UP IN THE PAST.  FORTUNATELY THE STEERING DIDN'T LOCK UP BUT IT REALLY FRIGHTENED ME.  THE DEALER WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY PROBLEM IN THE DEALERSHIP AND NOW I'M SCARED TO DRIVE THE CAR FOR FEAR THE STEARING WHEEL WILL LOCK UP WHILE I'M DRIVING.  ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THIS HAPPENED I WAS MADE AWARE OF AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS PROBLEM BY NHTSA .  I HAVE A 2001 CHEVY CORVETTE.  CAN YOU PLEASE UPDATE ME ON THE INVESTGATION AND WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW??  REF. IN EA02-031 *CJS",
