I HAD THIS PROBLEM SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR BRAND NEW. I TOOK IT TO CRYSTAL LAKE HONDA, CRYSTAL LAKE, IL  EVEN BEFORE THE ONE YEAR WARRANTY EXPIRED AND THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT. THE PROBLEM STILL PERSISTS. TODAY I WAS GOING THROUGH THE COMPLAINTS ON THIS SITE AND WAS SHOCKED TO SEE 20 COMPLAINTS RELATED TO EITHER THIS SAME EXACT PROBLEM OR THE FACT THAT THE AIRBAGS EITHER DID NOT DEPLOY DURING ACCIDENT OR DEPLOYED UN-NECESSARILY. I HOPE HONDA DOES SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. I BOUGHT A HONDA ACCORD OVER A COMPETING MODEL BECAUSE THIS ONE HAD SIDE AIRBAGS. NOW AFTER READING HOW THE AIRBAGS DO NOT DEPLOY I AM UPSET. LET ME KNOW IF THERE IS A FIX TO THIS PROBLEM AND WHAT I CAN TELL THE DEALER.  *JB",
