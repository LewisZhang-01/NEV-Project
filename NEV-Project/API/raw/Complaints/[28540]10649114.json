AFTER THEY GAVE ME THE RUNAROUND FOR 6+ MONTHS, NISSAN SAID IT WAS NOT THEIR PROBLEM, THAT IT WAS AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE. I HAVE SINCE HAD THE CAR REPAIRED. THE HOOD NEEDED TO BE TAKEN DOWN TO BARE METAL, AND REPAINTED. THE COST WAS OVER $500.00. NOW THE ROOF IS DOING THE SAME AS THE HOOD.I AM NOT A HAPPY NISSAN OWNER.  *TR",
