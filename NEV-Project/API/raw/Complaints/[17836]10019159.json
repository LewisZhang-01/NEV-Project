I NEVER SAW OR HEARD ANYTHING HIT IT.  I HAVE SINCE GOTTEN ABOUT 10 CHIPS IN MY WINDSHIELD.  EVER SINCE I GOT THE CAR, MY WINDSHIELD HAS CREAKED AND MADE A LOT OF NOISE AS IF IT WERE SHIFTING AROUND.  THIS SCARES ME SO MUCH!  THEN, I HAD AN APPOINTMENT THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON TO GET ONE CHIP FIXED WHEN THE WINDSHIELD CREAKED LOUDLY AND A CRACK WENT RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE.  I HONESTLY AM AFRAID SOMETIMES THAT MY WINDSHIELD IS GOING TO FLY RIGHT OFF OF MY CAR!",
