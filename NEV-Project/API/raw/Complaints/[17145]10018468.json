        "summary": "THE LUGGAGE RACK ON THE TOP OF MY JEEP PULLED OUT.  THE SCREWS JUST PULLED THROUGH THE HOLES.  THERE WERE NO WASHERS OR ANYTHING OF THAT TYPE TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING.  THIS WAS DONE WHEN STRAPPING AN ITEM TO THE TOP TO SECURE IT.  THIS IS A POTENTIAL ROAD HAZARD.  I DON'T WANT TO BE BEHIND THE JEEP THAT HAS THIS HAPPEN ON THE ROAD AND LOSES IT'S LOAD INTO THE ROAD OR ONTO THE AUTOMOBILE FOLLOWING.  JEEP WILL NOT HELP US IN REPAIRING THE PROBLEM NOR DO THEY CARE ABOUT THE POSSIBLE HAZARD.  I SPOKE TO MIKE AT THE SERVICE DESK AT CHRYSLER AND HE TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS NOT A MANUFACTURING PROBLEM AND THEREFORE THEY WOULD DO NOTHING TO REMEDY THE SITUATION.  WHEN I TOLD HIM IT WAS A DESIGN FLAW, HE SAID HE DIDN'T CARE.  I PLAN ON CONTACTING THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, IF THEY WILL ALLOW ME, AND LET THEM KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  WHEN THE SCREW AND CASING PULLED THROUGH, IT ENLARGED THE HOLE AND PROTRUDED UP THROUGH THE ROOF TOP.  IF ONE CAN NOT TIGHTEN A TOP LOAD ON THE LUGGAGE RACK, WHAT IS TO PREVENT IT FROM COMING OFF AT ANY TIME????   PLEASE HELP US AND OTHERS WITH JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE'S TO PREVENT A FUTURE ACCIDENT DUE TO TOP MOUNTED LOADS FROM COMING OFF.    *JB",
