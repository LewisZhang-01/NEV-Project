HE STATED THAT HE KNEW OF SEVERAL CASES THAT THE INNER REAR TIRE HAD SEVERE TIRE WEAR AND COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. I CHECK MY TIRES AND FOUND THAT BOTH REAR TIRES HAD BEEN WORN DOWN UNTIL THE STEEL BELT WAS VISIBLE ON THE INNER TWO INCHES OF THE TIRES AFTER ONLY 20,000 MILES. THE FRONT TIRES ALSO HAD WORN ON THE INSIDE TWO INCHES OF THE TIRE. I CONTACTED THE DEALER WHERE THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED AND TOLD THERE WAS NO RECALL OR SERVICE BULLETIN AND THE PROBLEM WAS I DID NOT ROTATE THE TIRES PROPERLY. AFTER CALLING SEVERAL OTHER DEALERS AND GM CUSTOMER SERVICE THE DEALER WHERE IT WAS PURCHASED TOLD ME TO BRING IT IN TO BE CHECKED. WHEN I ARRIVED BEFORE THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT EVEN LOOKED AT THE VEHICLE, I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING COVERED BY THE WARRANTY AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO. I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT MY VEHICLE WAS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE HOME DUE TO THE TIRE WEAR. I WAS TOLD BY THE GM CUSTOMER SERVICE IT WAS NOT THERE PROBLEM, CASE CLOSED.  I DID LEARN AFTER SOME RESEARCH THE GM HAS A PROBLEM WITH THE 2007 CHEVROLET IMPALA POLICE VEHICLE. 'A CONDITION THAT MAY CAUSE REAR WHEEL MISALIGNMENT, RESULTING IN LOWER TREAD DEPT ON THE INNER SIDE OF THE REAR TIRES'.  GM WILL 'REPLACE REAR WHEEL SPINDLE RODS, ALIGN THE REAR WHEELS AND IF NECESSARY REPLACE THE REAR TIRES AT NO COST.  GM HAS ADMITTED THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE POLICE IMPALA BUT NOT ANY OTHER MODELS OF THE IMPALA. BEFORE THIS CAUSES ACCIDENTS GM NEEDS TO COME OUT WITH A RECALL TO FIX ALL OF THE IMPALAS.  *TR",
