        "summary": "I HAD MY XENON HID HEADLIGHTS STOLEN THE WEEK BEFORE CHRISTMAS. IT SEEMS THAT IF THE ASSEMBLY AROUND THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR HANDLE IS POPPED OUT SLIGHTLY, THE CONTACTS UNDERNEATH CAN BE SHORTED AND BOTH WINDOWS LOWERED. ONCE IN, IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES TO TAKE THE LIGHTS. IT'S NOT THE LIGHTS THEMSELVES THAT THEY ARE AFTER, RATHER THE HARDWARE THAT POWERS THE LIGHTS. ONCE THEY HAVE THE HARDWARE THEY CAN PUT IT IN ANY CAR. HAD I KNOWN THAT THESE LIGHTS WERE SUCH A HOT ITEM, I NEVER WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THE CAR. NISSAN IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM SO THEY HAVE PROVIDED REPAIR FACILITIES WITH REPAIR KITS TO MAKE THE TURN AROUND TIME SHORTER. BUT THAT DOES NOTHING TO THE FEELING OF HAVING YOUR CAR VIOLATED.  I DRIVE IN FEAR NOW. I CAN'T GO TO THE MOVIES. IF I GO TO THE MALL I HAVE TO SIT IN THE CAR AND SEND THE WIFE IN TO DO THE SHOPPING. NOW THAT THE WEATHER IS GETTING WARM AGAIN I WORRY EVEN MORE. I TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT I HAVE AT LEAST $500 (DEDUCTIBLE) ON A CREDIT CARD SOMEWHERE FOR THE NEXT TIME THIS HAPPENS. GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL. *JB",
