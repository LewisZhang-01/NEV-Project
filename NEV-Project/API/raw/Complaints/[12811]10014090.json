LIKEWISE, THE AUDI A4 SHARES THE SAME CHASSIS AND SAME FRONT END SUSPENSION.  JUST LIKE THE VOG RECALLED THE PASSAT AOA HAS RECALLED THE A4.  HOWEVER VOA HAS DECIDED TO NOT ISSUE A RECALL AND RISKING THE PASSAT CUSTOMER BASE INJURY OR EVEN DEATH.  WHY IS IT THE EXACT SAME PARTS WERE RECALLED AND THE SAME CHASSIS, BUT VOA HAS NOT RECALLED THE PASSAT. THE DEALERSHIP HAS TOLD ME THAT IT WILL COST 1,400.00 DOLLARS TO REPLACE THE CONTROL ARMS. NHTSA NEEDS TO QUESTION VOA ON THIS MATTER.  MY CAR HAS 40,000 MILES ON IT AND IS BEING MAINTAINED BY A VOLKSWAGEN TECHNICIAN.  THERE IS JUST NO REASON WHY A PART THAT IS DESIGNED TO LAST THE LIFE OF THE CAR HAS FAILED AT 40,000 MILES.   *JB",
