I DON'T DRIVE IT IN THE WINTER SO IT DOESN'T SEE MUCH SALT.I RECENTLY NOTICED RUST HOLES IN BOTH MY DRIVERS SIDE AND PASSENGERS SIDE FLOORBOARDS WHICH IS RIDICULOUS AND UNACCEPTABLE CONSIDERING THE CAR IS BARELY SEVEN YEARS OLD AND SO WELL TAKEN CARE OF.MY OPINION IS THAT THE METAL USED IS FAR TOO THIN AND THAT IT IS A FLAWED DESIGN.NISSAN SHOULD RECALL ALL OF THESE ALTIMAS WITH THIS PROBLEM AND MAKE IT RIGHT.I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER NISSAN AGAIN... *TR",
