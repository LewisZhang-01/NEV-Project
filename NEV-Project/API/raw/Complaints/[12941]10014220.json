I BROUGHT MY 1999 PASSAT TO THE DEALER REGARDING A NOISY FRONT SUSPENSION PROBLEM AND INFORMED THEM OF A TSB ON THE VEHICLE. I WAS INFORMED THAT VW PROVIDES A REPAIR KIT FOR THIS PROBLEM THAT REQUIRES THE REPLACEMENT OF THE LOWER CONTROL ARM ASSEMBLY. WHICH INCLUDES THE DEFECTIVE BALL JOINTS (BOTH SIDES). THE DEALER INFORMED ME THAT VW WILL NOT COVER THE REPAIR AND THAT THE COST TO ME WOULD BE $875.00. SPOKE WITH VW REPRESENTATIVES ON APRIL 2 AND WAS GIVEN A DECISION ON 4/9 THAT THEY WOULD NOT ASSIST WITH THE COST IN ANY WAY SINCE \"THIS COULD ALSO BE CAUSED BY NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR\". THIS ASSERTION, IN MY OPINION IS BOGUS SINCE A. VW KNOWS THERE IS A PROBLEM, HENCE THE TSB. PROVIDE A \"KIT\" TO REPAIR THE DEFECT.  THE CASE NUMBER IS 30164333.     SUSPENSIONS SHOULD NOT BE FALLING APART ON A 3 YEAR OLD VEHICLE WITH 50,000 MILES ON IT. AND THE COST ($875) IS QUITE EXCESSIVE.   THE NOISE STARTED SHOWING UP IN EARLY JANUARY OF 2003.   *NLM",
