ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS WHILE ATTEMPTING TO STOP MY CAR AT A CITY INTERSECTION THE BRAKE PEDAL, UPON APPLICATION, TRAVELLED ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR WITHOUT THE BRAKES ENGAGING. I IMMEDIATELY LET OFF THE BRAKE PEDAL AND BEGAN TO PUMP THE PEDAL, WHICH EVENTUALLY ENGAGED THE BRAKES SOFTLY. FORTUNATELY BOTH TIMES I WAS ABLE TO FINALLY STOP THE VEHICLE BEFORE COLLIDING WITH ANOTHER CAR. FOR A LITTLE WHILE AFTER THAT THE BRAKES CONTINUED TO BE VERY SOFT, REQUIRING MUCH MORE PEDAL TRAVEL THAN NORMAL.",
