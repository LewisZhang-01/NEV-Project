THESE HOUSING WERE REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY ON 2/18/97 DUE TO THIS PROBLEM. AGAIN ON 3/25/98, THESE HOUSINGS WERE REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY DUE TO SAME PROBLEM. THE MOISTURE PROBLEM CONTINUED AND WHEN PRESENTED TO DEALER ON 09/07/01 FOR SERVICE, WE WERE TOLD THAT THIS WAS A NORMAL CONDITION AND CADILLAC HAS WASHED ITS HANDS WITH NO REPLACEMENT. THEY HAVE IMPLIED THAT THIS A DEFECTIVE DESIGN AND CAN ONLY BE FIXED BY REPLACEMENT, BUT AT OWNER'S COST. NOW, THIS PROBLEM HAS CONTINUALLY GOT WORSE RESULTING IN CORROSION IN LIGHT BULB SOCKETS CAUSING LIGHT FAILURE.  I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS MOISTURE WILL EVENTUALLY CAUSE A ELECTRICAL SHORT RESULTING IN A FIRE, ETC. OR VISIBILITY CONCERNS FOR ON COMING VEHICLES. IS CADILLAC WAITING FOR AN ACCIDENT CAUSED BY THESE CONDITIONS BEFORE THEY REACT?????  ALSO REFERENCE TO ODI ID#10014105,8008955,8008954.  *JB",
