        "summary": "WE ASKED OUR DEALERSHIP TO ACQUIRE IT FOR US AFTER OUR 2004 TDI WAS TOTALED. CURRENT VEHICLE IS A CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED WE PURCHASED  APRIL 25, 2006 WITH 10583 MILES ON IT. PREVIOUS OWNER WAS VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA.  ON JULY 2, 2006 WHILE ON VACATION THE CLUTCH COMPLETELY FAILED AFTER DRIVING SEVERAL MILES IN BUMPER TO BUMPER TRAFFIC IT STARTED SMOKING AND THEN THE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR AND THE CLUTCH LOCKED UP. THE VEHICLE THEN HAD ABOUT 14-15,000 MILES ON IT.  A MAINE DEALER  DETERMINED THAT THE HYDRAULIC CYLINDER HAD FAILED AND THE ENTIRE CLUTCH FAILED.  TOOK MORE THAN TWO WEEKS TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE.  WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS SERVICED BY OUR VIRGINIA DEALER IT WAS REPORTED TO US THAT THE TRANSMISSION WAS CRACKED DUE TO IMPROPER RE-INSTALLATION. VEHICLE THEN HAD 17632 MILES ON IT. IT TOOK ANOTHER TWO WEEKS TO FORCE THE MAINE DEALER TO PAY FOR THE REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION AND REPLACE IT. ON DEC. 6, 2006 MY WIFE THE VALET PARKING SERVICE  BROUGHT THE CAR TO HER WITH CONSIDERABLE SMOKE COMING FROM THE CLUTCH AND THE STATEMENT THAT IT HAD \"BURNED OUT\" WHILE TRYING TO COME UP A RAMP. THE DEALERSHIP CLAIMS ABUSE CAUSED THE CLUTCH TO FAIL AND CRACK THE FLYWHEEL IN THREE PLACES AND WARRANTY FOR THE FLYWHEEL WAS DENIED. WE HAVE OWNED MORE THAN SIX STANDARD TRANSMISSION AUTOMOBILES OVER OUR MORE THAN 3 0 YEARS OF DRIVING EXPERIENCE AND HAVE NEVER HAD A CLUTCH FAIL OTHER THAN THE 2 FAILURES IN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS WITH THIS VOLKSWAGEN. INTERNET RESEARCH INFORMS US THAT THIS IS A VERY PREVALENT PROBLEM WITH VOLKSWAGENS. CLEARLY THE DUAL MASS FLYWHEEL IS DEFECTIVE IN THIS VEHICLE AND THE CLUTCH IS IN GENERAL PRONE TO VERY PREMATURE FAILURE.  *NM",
