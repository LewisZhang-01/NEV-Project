AT 55,000 MILES THE OIL LEAK WAS BACK AND NOW THE DEALER SAID THE HEAD WAS WARPED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED FOR $2400.  DEALER SAID FORD WOULD NOT REPLACE THE HEAD THE FIRST TIME ONLY THE GASKET AND NOW THAT THE WARRANTY IS OVER I WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR.  I HAVE CONTACTED THE FORD DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BOARD AND THEY CAN NOT HELP BECAUSE THEY WILL ONLY LOOK AT PROBLEMS WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THE WARRANTY.  I SAY THE HEAD SHOULD OF BEEN REPLACED NOT THE GASKET AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE ONLY OPTION I HAVE LEFT IS SMALL CLAIMS COURT.  RC",
