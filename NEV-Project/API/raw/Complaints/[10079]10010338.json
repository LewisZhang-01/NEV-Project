TO GET THEM TO WORK, I HAVE TO PULL OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, SHUT OFF MY VEHICLE AND TURN IT BACK ON.  I COMPLAINED TO THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT THIS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND THEY TOLD ME THAT UNLESS IT STOPS ALTOGETHER, THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO LOCATE THE PROBLEM.  WELL, NOW I HAVE 90,000 MILES ON THIS VAN AND IT'S A 5 1/2 YEAR OLD VEHICLE (1997).  LAST WEEK 3/7/03, I RECEIVED A NOTICE OF THIS PROBLEM FROM CHEVY.  CHEVY WILL FIX THIS PROBLEM IF THE VEHICLE HAS LESS THAN 70,000 MILES ON IT.  THAT LEAVE ME OUT OF THE PICTURE.  I DON'T THINK THAT IS RIGHT, CONSIDERING THAT I TRIED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT YEARS AGO.*JB",
