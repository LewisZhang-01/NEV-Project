AFTER PUTTING FIRE OUT, DISCOVERED THE FIRE HAD BEEN STARTED BY THE WRING INSIDE OF THE DOOR.  ELECTRIC MIRROR IS NOT FUSED.  WIRING IS STILL ENERGIZED.  INSIDE DOOR PANEL IS BURNED COMPLETELY THROUGH.  I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANY KIND OF BULLETIN OR RECALL INFO ON THIS PROBLEM FROM GM.   GM HAS GIVEN ME  A CASE NUMBER ([XXX]), BUT I AM GETTING THE RUN AROUND.  I CALL, GET AN ANSWERING MACHINE, LEAVE MESSAGE, NO ONE CALLS YOU BACK.  ANY HELP YOU CAN GIVE ME WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO USE THE VEHICLE BECAUSE OF THE BURNED SMELL AS THE WINDOWS WILL NOT GO DOWN.  THE WHOLE INSIDE OF THE TRUCK IS COVERED IN SOOT.  SHOULD YOU NEED PHOTOS, I CAN E-MAIL THEM TO YOU.    THANK YOU.      *NLM      INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
