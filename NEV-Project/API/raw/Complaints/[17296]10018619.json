I WAS DRIVING AT 65 MPH AT THE TIME AND WITH THE FAILURE OF THE PUMP, I LOST ALL POWER, INCLUDING STEERING AND BRAKES. I VERY NARROWLY AVOIDED AN ACCIDENT AND OTHER TRAFFIC. THIS WAS VERY SCARY AND TRYING TO STEER AND BRAKE WITHOUT POWER IS NOT EASY. THIS IS THE 3RD TIME THAT A FUEL PUMP HAS FAILED ON A TAHOE OWNED BY MYSELF, ALTHOUGH THE OTHER 2 TIMES THE FAILURE WAS WHILE PARKED AND NOT AT HIGH SPEED. MY CURRENT CAR HAS 72,000 MILES. THE PREVIOUS INCIDENTS WERE AT APPROX THE SAME MILEAGE. IS THIS NORMAL? HAVE ANY OTHER ACCIDENTS BEEN CAUSED BY SUDDEN AND CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF TAHOE FUEL PUMPS?  *JB",
