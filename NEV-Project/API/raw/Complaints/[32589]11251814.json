OUR LOCAL GMC SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAID THAT IT IS THE 'DRIVER' ATTACHED TO THE LED BULB THAT IS FAULTY, BUT IT CANNOT SIMPLY BE REPLACED. THEY HAVE TO REINSTALL AN ENTIRE TAIL LIGHT WHICH APPARENTLY IS PRETTY COSTLY. I WAS QUOTED $925. AGAIN, NOTHING WRONG WITH THE LIGHT BULB ITSELF. SHOULDN'T COST $925 TO FIX.",
