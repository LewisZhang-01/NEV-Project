THIS CAR HAD 44813 MILES ON IT WHEN THIS HAPPENED, MECHANIC SAID THIS IS UNHEARD OF AND DUG TO FIND THE REASON.  WATER PUMP WAS LEAKING INTERNALLY, CAUSED THE TIMING GEAR TO RUST AND FREEZE WHICH CAUSED THE BELT TO BREAK.  THIS CAUSED ENGINE PROBLEMS AND HAD TO HAVE THE HEAD RESURFACED.  THIS PROBLEM CAUSED MAJOR PROBLEMS AND EXPENSE ($2245.17).  OWNER OF THE SHOP SAID THAT A TIMING BELT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE MAINTENANCE (LOOK AT IT) UNTIL A VEHICLE HAS 60,000 MILES ON IT.  THERE WAS NO WAY TO KNOW THAT THE WATER PUMP HAD A PROBLEM.",
