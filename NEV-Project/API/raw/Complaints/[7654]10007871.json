DISCUSSING THE ISSUE WITH A NUMBER OF AUTOMOTIVE PROFESSIONALS, I LEARNED THIS IS APPARENTLY A COMMON OCCURRENCE.  NOW IF THE LENS FALLS OFF, THE HEADLIGHT BULB IS EXPOSED AND CAN EASILY BE DAMAGED AND NOT FUNCTION - IS THIS NOT A SAFETY CONCERN?  SHOULD NOT THIS ISSUE BE ADDRESSED AS A POSSIBLE THREAT TO SAFETY IN THE OPERATION OF A MOTOR VEHICLE? THANK YOU.",
