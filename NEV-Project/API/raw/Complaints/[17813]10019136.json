WE TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER AND THEY REPLACED THE FRONT WINDSHIELD STATING IT WAS NOT SEALED CORRECTLY TO THE CAR'S BODY. THE NEXT NIGHT IT RAINED AGAIN AND THERE WAS A PUDDLE OF WATER IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND NOW THEY ARE SAYING THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL METAL WAS NOT SEALED AT THE LEFT TOP CORNER ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE. THEY ARE KEEPING IT OVERNIGHT TO SEE IF IT'S STILL LEAKING AND WILL NOTIFY ME TOMORROW.   *NLM",
