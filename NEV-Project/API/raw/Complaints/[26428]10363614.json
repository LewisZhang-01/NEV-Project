        "summary": "2003 AUDI RS6 (A6 4.2 V8 BITURBO) FUEL TANK DEFECT:    THIS COMPLAINT IS IN REGARD TO MY 2003 AUDI RS6 SEDAN.  AFTER NOTICING A STRONG SMELL OF FUEL AND FUEL VAPOR IN MY GARAGE THE MORNING AFTER FILLING UP SAID CAR, I IMMEDIATELY TOOK MY VEHICLE TO MY LOCAL AUDI DEALER TO HAVE THE CAR INSPECTED AND DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED THAT THE CAR'S FUEL TANK IS BROKEN AT THE TOP WHERE THE ROLL OVER VALVE IS BONDED TO THE TANK.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A 7 YEAR OLD VEHICLE SHOULD NOT HAVE SUCH A POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS PROBLEM SUCH AS A LEAKING FUEL TANK.  IN MY RESEARCH I HAVE NOW FOUND THAT A SIMILAR PROBLEM EXISTS WITH OTHER AUDI A6 BASED MODELS - AND THAT THERE HAS BEEN A RECALL SAFETY RECALL (08V-157) FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM, HOWEVER ONLY ON VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH THE SMALLER 18.5 GALLON FUEL TANK.  THE 21.7 GALLON TANK IN THE AUDI RS6 (4.2 BITURBO QUATTRO) IS MADE OF THE SAME DEFECTIVE MATERIALS AND APPEARS TO HAVE FAILED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE OTHER A6 BASED VEHICLES LISTED IN THE REFERENCED SAFETY RECALL.  THIS ISSUE APPEARS TO BE QUITE PREVALENT IN ALL B5 AUDI A6 BASED MODELS (REGARDLESS OF TANK SIZE OR VENT LINE MATERIALS) AND I BELIEVE THAT THE NHTSA SHOULD INVESTIGATE ALL COMPLAINTS AND RECALL ALL 2001-2004 AUDI A6 BASED VEHICLES (INCLUDING THE RS6) AS THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS FAILURE THAT SHOULD NOT HAPPEN IN VEHICLE SYSTEM THAT IS  CRUCIAL TO SAFETY.  I CONSIDER MYSELF VERY FORTUNATE THAT THE FUEL AND VAPOR LEAK DIS NOT IGNITE AS IN MY GARAGE IS MY HOMES GAS STORAGE WATER HEATER.  *TR",
