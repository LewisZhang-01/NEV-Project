        "summary": "FRONT PASSENGERS SEAT BELT IS FAULTY!  I WAS IN A COLLISION AND REAR ENDED BY ANOTHER DRIVER.  MY MOTHER WAS WITH ME AND IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.  HER SEAT BELT AT THE SHOULDER DID NOT LOCK AND AS A RESULT SHE WAS THROWN FORWARD, CAUSING A TORN ROTATOR CUFF.  SHE HAS DOCTORS DOCUMENTS TO BACK THIS UP.  SURGERY WAS SCHEDULED WITH NO ADVAIL.  WE HAD OTHER COMPLICATIONS ARISE AND THE DOCTOR CANCELED SURGERY IN THE OPERATING PREP. ROOM.  WE HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO SPECIALIST AND ARE NOW AWAITING FOR THEM TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO AGAIN SCHEDULE SURGERY.  IN THE MEAN TIME, THE WAVE 3 TROUBLE SHOOTER, SUGGESTED I CONTACT YOUR OFFICE.  ANY HELP THAT YOU CAN BE IN THIS MATTER WOULD BE APPRECIATED.  MY MOTHER REMAINS IN PAIN ON MEDICATION, AND CHEVROLET OFFICIALS WON'T HELP MY MOTHER IN ANY WAY.  THE VEHICLE IN QUESTION IS A 1999 CHEVROLET BLAZER, 4 DOOR, 4X4.  INITIALLY, ALL WE ASK CHEVROLET FOR WAS A NEW SEATBELT.  HOWEVER, THROUGH THE INTERNET AND CNN NEWS, I KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN OTHER REPORTS FOR THIS PROBLEM.  SO I FEEL THAT CHEVROLET SHOULD COMPENSATE ME FOR MY INJURIES THAT I HAVE AND WILL SUFFER PAIN FROM.    *NLM",
