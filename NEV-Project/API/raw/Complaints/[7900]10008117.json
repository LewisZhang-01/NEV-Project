I HAD TO HAVE THE IGNITION SWITCH REPLACED AND SUBSEQUENTLY HAD TO ALSO REPLACE THE HEADLIGHT CONTROL ASSEMBLY AS WELL.*JB    AUDI USA SAID THAT MY VEHICLE WAS NOT COVERED AS PART OF THE CURRENT CAMPAIGN.  HOWEVER, I'VE SEEN NUMEROUS POSTINGS ON THE AUDI CHAT BOARDS FROM PEOPLE IN MY EXACT POSITION (SAME PROBLEM, SAME YEAR CAR - BUT AUDI USA SAYS THEY'RE NOT COVERED).    SEEMS LIKE IT'S A LITTLE SCREWY.  PLEASE CONFIRM RECIEPT OF THIS MESSAGE AND LET ME KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY NEXT STEPS I SHOULD TAKE.    THANKS MUCH",
