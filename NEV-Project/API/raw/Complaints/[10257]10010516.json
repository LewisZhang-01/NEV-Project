THE 200+ TRANSMISSION WERE UNDER RECALL. I DIRECTLY ASKED HONDA IF THE PART (AUTO TRANSMISSION) WAS THE SAME IN THE 99 ACCORD AS THE 2000 / 2001 WHICH IS UNDER RECALL. THOUGH SEVERAL HONDA DEALERSHIPS I FOUND OUT THAT THE PART (AUTO TRANSMISSION) IS EXACTLY THE SAME IN A 99, 2000 OR 2001 HONDA ACCORD. THE HONDA WARRANTY TEAM WOULD NOT ADMIT (AGAIN I DIRECTLY ASKED) THAT THE PART WAS THE SAME. THUS, I AM LEFT WITH HONDA KNOWING THAT 99 ACCORD'S HAVE KNOWN DEFECTIVE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS THAT FAIL AT ROAD SPEED (ERRATIC SHIFTING).  MY TRANSMISSION FAILED ON AN INTERSTATE AT 60 MPH ROAD SPEED BY SHIFTING FROM DRIVE TO REVERSE. I ALMOST GOT HIT BY AN 18 WHEELER THAT HAD TO GO OFF ROAD TO AVOID MY CAR.  I GUESS WHEN THE FATALITIES GROW BIG ENOUGH TO WARRANT A CLASS ACTION SUIT HONDA WILL BE FORCED TO RECALL.    *NLM",
