ALL 20 LUG NUTS SHOW EVIDENCE OF SEPARATION OF THE STEEL NUT AND THE DECORATIVE CHROME COVER COVERING THE STEEL LUG NUT.  DEFECT WAS FOUND BY TIRE DEALER DURING PURCHASE OF NEW TIRES WHEN THE TECHNICIAN HAD DIFFICULTY REMOVING LUG NUTS.   ACCORDING TO THE TIRE STORE MANAGER THIS DAMAGE IS CAUSED BY WATER GETTING BETWEEN THE STEEL NUT AND THE DECORATIVE CAP WHICH CAUSES RUST TO FORM.  WHEN THE OXIDATION FORMS IT PUTS PRESSURE ON THE DECORATIVE CAP CAUSING IT TO EXPAND.  THE NORMAL 21MM WRENCH WILL NOT FIT OVER THE LUG NUT DUE TO THE EXPANSION SO THE NEXT SIZE WRENCH IS NECESSARY WHICH THEN DAMAGES THE NUT.  THE NORMAL LUG NUT WRENCH SUPPLIED BY THE MANUFACTURER FOR THE CAR IS THEREFORE NOT ABLE TO BE USED TO REMOVE LUG NUTS.    I HAVE THE DAMAGED LUG NUTS IF NEEDED FOR EXAMINATION",
