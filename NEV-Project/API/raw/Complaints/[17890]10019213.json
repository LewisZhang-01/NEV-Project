        "summary": "\"THE FAMOUS HEAD GASKET FAILURE THAT NOBODY WANTS TO TOUCH\". YES, I HAVE A 98 DODGE STRATUS THAT IS LEAKING AT THE HEAD GASKET. I HAD TO BUY ONE OF THOSE FLAT PANS TO CATCH THE OIL IN WHILE THE CAR IS PARKED IN THE GARAGE. MY 2 YEAR OLD GOT OUT THERE THE OTHER DAY AND DECIDED TO PLAY IN THE USED OIL. IS THIS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE? HAVING TO KEEP A PAN OF DIRTY OIL UNDER A CAR? I DRAIN IT ONCE A WEEK AND GET AT LEAST 1 QUART. (AND HAVE TO PAY TO DISPOSE OF IT) COME ON HERE!  SO, ON TOP OF THE FIRE HAZARD (HOT OIL ON A HOT CATALYST), NOW WE HAVE POISONING ISSUES WITH OUR CHILDREN. IS ANYBODY GOING TO HELP US, OR SHOULD WE JUST START THE WHOLE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT? I AM SURE THERE ARE ENOUGH PEOPLE HERE TO BACK ME UP ON THIS. ACCORDING TO ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS HERE, DODGE ALREADY KNOWS ABOUT IT AND MADE A STRONGER GASKET TO REPLACE IT WITH.    *NLM",
