ON THREE OCCASIONS, APPROACHING STOPS AT LESS THAN 30 MPH, CAR HAS GONE THROUGH LIMIT LINE EXCEEDING STOPPING POINT BY AT LEAST 10 FEET, UNDER NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS.  THIS CAR HAS BEEN INSPECTED BY MANUFACTURER THREE TIMES.  SERVICE DEPARTMENT IS UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THIS IS \"NORMAL\" FOR ABS BRAKES.  PAPERWORK FROM SERVICE DEPARTMENT ALSO INDICATES THAT CAR IS SAFE TO DRIVE.  I AM AFRAID TO PUT MYSELF, A PASSENGER, OR ANOTHER MOTORIST AT RISK.  THE CAR IS JUST OVER ONE-YEAR-OLD, AND I HAVE COMPLETELY STOPPED DRIVING THE CAR.  I HAVE WRITTEN A LETTER TO TOYOTA 4-26-03 REQUESTING A FULL REFUND UNDER THE LEMON LAW.   *NLM",
