I TOOK IT TO FORD 8 TIMES AND FINALLY THEY SAID IT WAS THE CAMBERS AND CASTERS.    AFTER HAVING IT FOR A YEAR I HAVE HAD TO CONTINUOUSLY PUT STEERING FLUID IN.  NOW FORD HAS DISCOVERED THAT SOMETHING CALLED THE STEERING RACK WAS BROKE AND LEAKING.  ALSO, THE EMERGENCY BREAK HAD BECOME LOOSE.  AND NOW THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH A WHINING AND SWAYING IN THE REAR END.  SO FAR THEY CAN'T FIND OUT WHAT THE WHINING IS AND FOUND THAT THE WHEEL BEARS WERE LOCKING UP.  A DIAGNOSIS HASN'T BEEN MADE AT THIS MOMENT AND IT'S STILL WITH FORD FOR 4 DAYS.     *NLM",
