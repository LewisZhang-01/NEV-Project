I CALLED THE VW ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE AND THEY SENT A TOW TRUCK TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE DEALER. I HAD MY WIFE, MY SON, MY SISTER IN LAW, AND MY DOG, SO FINDING A WAY HOME WAS NOT EASY. I WAS LUCKY THAT WHEN THIS HAPPENED I WAS STILL WITHIN MY \"HOME\" AREA, AND WAS ABLE TO FIND A FRIEND WITH A LARGE ENOUGH CAR. AFTER THE DEALER OPENED THE NEXT DAY, THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A COIL PACK THAT HAD GONE BAD AND THE PART WILL TAKE A WEEK OR TWO TO GET. I HAVE A RENTAL THAT IS PAID FOR BY THE DEALER, BUT IT IS NOT THE SAME TYPE OF CAR I BOUGHT, A STATION WAGON. I DID SOME RESEARCH TO SEE WHAT A COIL PACK IS, AND FOUND MANY OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM, AND THE PROBLEM HAPPENS MORE THAN ONCE. I AM VERRY CONCERNED THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN AND I WON'T BE NEAR A FRIEND WHO CAN RESCUE ME AND MY FAMILY.",
