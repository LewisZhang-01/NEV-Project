        "summary": "IN AUGUST OF 2002 , I WAS DRIVING MY 1999 RODEO THAT I HAD LEASED NEW IN 2002 AND THIS RUNNING NOISE CONTINUED AFTER I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE. IT WAS THE ABS MODULE. IT HAD TO BE UNPLUGGED TO KEEP THE BATTERY FROM BEING RUN DOWN. THE REPAIR IS ABOUT $500.00 AND ISUZU WANTS TO IGNORE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THIS COMPONENT. BEFORE THE NOISE STARTED,THE STOPPING DISTANCE WAS VERY LONG AND THERE WAS A POPPING FEELING IN THE BRAKE PEDAL. I TOOK IT IN TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD \"NOTHING WAS WRONG AND THAT WAS THE WAY ANTI-LOCK BRAKES FELT\" THE ABS LIGHT CAME ON.  ALL OF THIS STARTED WITH 40,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE. THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE RODEO THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND RECALLED BY ISUZU WITHOUT THE COST OF LIFE OR MONEY TO THE CONSUMER.  *JB",
