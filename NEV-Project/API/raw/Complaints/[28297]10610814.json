        "summary": "I PURCHASED MY SUBARU OUTBACK 2014 3.6R LIMITED IN MID DECEMBER 2013, I FELT THAT THE CAR PULLS TO THE RIGHT AFTER I DROVE THE CAR TO HOME, I CANNOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANY PROBLEM WITH A NEW CAR, WITH THAT I KEPT TO DRIVE AND MONITOR IT FOR 2 WEEKS THEN I CONFIRMED THIS IS REALLY AN ISSUE AND IT'S VERY EASY TO REPRODUCE. SO I BROUGHT THE CAR TO MY DEALER, THE TECHNICIAN SPENT HALF A DAY TO FIX, ROTATED TIRE, CHECKED PRESSURE AND CHECKED ALIGNMENT, FINALLY THEY REPLACED 4 BRAND NEW TIRES THEN THEY STATED THAT THE ORIGINAL TIRE IS NOT GOOD, THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED BY REPLACING NEW TIRES AND LET ME DROVE THE CAR BACK.  AFTER MORE THAN 3000 MILES DRIVING, THE SAME PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE AGAIN, SO I WENT TO DEALER AND THEY CONFIRMED THIS IS REPRODUCIBLE, IT'S FUNNY THAT THEY REPLACED 4 NEW TIRES INCLUDING WHEEL HUB THIS TIME AGAIN, HOWEVER THIS ISSUE IS STILL NOT BEEN FIXED, THE TECHNICIAN CALLED SUBARU SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE, REPRESENTATIVE SUGGESTED TO LOOSE THE CAP OF SUSPENSION , BOUNCE THE CAR MULTIPLE TIMES THEN INSTALL THEM BACK, TECHNICIAN REPEATED THIS PROCEDURE FOR AT LEAST 2 TIMES, FINALLY THEN MENTIONED THE ALIGNMENT IS WITHIN SPEC, SERVICE ADVISE TOLD ME THE ISSUE IS BEEN FIXED.  I DROVE THE CAR FOR 2 WEEKS NOW, I'M STILL FEELING THERE IS SLIGHT PULLING TO RIGHT, AND THE STEERING WHEEL IS KEEPING TURN TO RIGHT BUT NOT BACK TO CENTER. I MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY DEALER TODAY, TECHNICIAN LEAD TESTED THE CAR WITH ME, HE WAS ABLE TO REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM I REPORTED, BUT HE SAID THIS IS NORMAL FOR SUBARU OUTBACK, AND LET ME CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR FURTHER CHECKING. THIS IS SO BAD, I DROVE SO MANY CARS BEFORE BUT NEVER GOT THE SAME ISSUE, AND THIS IS NOT SAFE IF THE CAR CANNOT GO STRAIGHT.  *TR",
