        "summary": "MY WIFE BOUGHT HER 1998 DODGE NEON IN AUGUST OF 2000.  WE RECENTLY PASSED 60,000 MILES ON THE CAR AND IT BEGAN TO LEAK OIL.  THE LEAK WAS GRADUAL AT FIRST AND I ASSUMED THAT THE OIL PAN BOLT HAD BEEN PUT IN INCORRECTLY BY THE SERVICEMEN AT THE LUBE SHOP.  HOWEVER, ON FURTHER REVIEW, THE CAR WAS FOUND TO HAVE A HEAD GASKET LEAK (APPROX. AN $800 REPAIR).  FURTHER RESEARCH HAS LED ME TO FIND THAT THIS PROBLEM IS COMMON TO ALL DODGE VEHICLES USING THIS ENGINE.      THE DEALER, IN CONJUNCTION WITH DODGE, HAS OFFERED TO COVER THE REPAIR, MINUS A $250 DEDUCTIBLE AND A $105 FEE FOR A COOLANT FLUSH/OIL CHANGE THAT THEY SAY IS NECESSARY WHEN DEALING WITH A HEAD GASKET REPAIR.  SO, IN REVIEW, DODGE'S PRODUCT IS FAULTY AND THEY KNOW IT.  NEVERTHELESS THEY WILL NOT ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR A FLAWED DESIGN THAT THEY CONCEIVED.  THIS PRACTICE OF SELLING A PRODUCT WITH KNOWN FLAWS, AND SUBSEQUENTLY REFUSING TO ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY IS, AT BEST, DISHONEST.",
