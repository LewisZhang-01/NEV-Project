ACCELERATING ON THE FREEWAY, NO INDICATION OF ANY PROBLEMS WHEN SHIFTING FROM 2ND TO 3RD...BUT WHEN SHIFTING FROM 3RD TO 4TH AT APPROXIMATELY 50MPH, THE GEAR SELECTOR LEVER HAD BECOME DIFFICULT TO MOVE. SUBSEQUENT SHIFTS FROM 4TH TO 5TH AND 5TH TO 6TH AT APPROXIMATELY 65MPH (NO LONGER ACCELERATING) WERE EVEN MORE CHALLENGING.    I EXITED THE FREEWAY, SHIFTING AS NEEDED WITH EVER-INCREASING DIFFICULTY. AT REST, WITH THE TRANSMISSION IN 1ST GEAR AND THE CLUTCH FULLY DEPRESSED, THE CAR CONTINUED TO CREEP FORWARD AS IF THE CLUTCH WERE NOT DISENGAGED. I WAS ABLE TO SHIFT INTO 2ND AND LIMP THE CAR TO A NEARBY DEALER.    DEALERSHIP DIAGNOSIS: A CLUTCH SPRING BROKE OFF, \"BOUNCED AROUND AND DESTROYED THE CLUTCH PLATE.\"  *TR",
