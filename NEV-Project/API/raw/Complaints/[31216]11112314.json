THIS SAME ENGINE HAS BEEN RECALLED IN SONATAS AND KIA SORENTOS OF THE SAME YEAR, BUT FOR SOME REASON NOT THE SANTA FE.  THE SONATA AND SORENTOS WERE RECALLED DUE TO MANUFACTURING PROCESSES LEAVING METAL DEBRIS IN OIL PASSAGES, WHICH EVENTUALLY BLOCKS OIL FROM REACHING THE ROD BEARINGS LEADING TO THE SAME FAILURE OUR SANTA FE EXPERIENCED. HYUNDAI NEEDS TO EXPAND THE RECALL TO ALL EFFECTED MODELS.",
