ALTHOUGH MY VEHICLE IS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY, I FEEL THAT A LEAKING INTAKE MANIFOLD IS A PREMATURE REPAIR FOR A VEHICLE ONLY 3 YEARS OLD. I HAVE DONE SOME SEARCHING AND KNOW THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY GM OWNER WITH THIS PROBLEM. THIS PROBLEM IS OBVIOUSLY A MANUFACTURER DEFECT  NOT TO MENTION A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS ONE. ANY LONGER AND I WOULD HAVE HAD A RUINED ENGINE THAT COULD HAVE CAUGHT FIRE OR STALLED ON THE HIGHWAY. GM NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PROBLEM.",
