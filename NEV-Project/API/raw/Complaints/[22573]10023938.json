        "summary": "2001 TOYOTA SIENNA LE, MANUFACTURED IN OCTOBER 2000, BOTH BACK SLIDING DOOR HANDLE BUTTONS STICK DURING HOT WEATHER PREVENTING OPENING OR CLOSING OF THE DOOR.  IF THE DOOR IS OPEN WHEN THE BUTTON STICKS THEN YOU CANNOT SHUT THE DOOR.  IF THE DOOR IS CLOSED WHEN THE BUTTON STICKS THEN YOU CANNOT OPEN THE DOOR FROM THE INSIDE OR THE OUTSIDE USING THE OUTSIDE HANDLE.  THE DOORS STAY STUCK UNTIL THE BUTTON POPS BACK OUT USUALLY WHEN THE INSIDE OF THE CAR TEMPERATURE COOLS DOWN.  MY CHILDREN HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET OUT BY GOING THROUGH THE FRONT DOORS OF THE VAN BUT AN ELDERLY PERSON MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO DO THIS AND WOULD BE TRAPPED IN THE BACK WITH BOTH DOORS STUCK SHUT.  THERE IS A SERVICE ADVISORY FOR THIS PROBLEM DATED OCT. 27, 2000 FOR YEARS 1998-2000 BUT THERE IS NOTHING FOR 2001.  THE TOYOTA EXTRA CARE PLATINUM EXTENDED WARRANTY WILL NOT COVER THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IT IS SUPPOSEDLY A BUTTON PROBLEM AND NOT A MECHANICAL PROBLEM.  THERE IS ALSO A PROBLEM WITH WATER LEAKING IN THE TRUNK.  WE HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT WERE IT IS COMING FROM YET.   *NLM",
