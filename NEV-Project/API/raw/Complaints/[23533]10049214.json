        "summary": "I MADE A LONG VACATION TRIP IN OCT. OF 2002 AT WHICH TIME MY 2002 OLDSMOBILE ALERO TURNED OVER 36,000 MILES.  BY THE TIME I ARRIVED HOME, IT HAD TURNED 37,000.  I DIDN'T DRIVE THE CAR FOR A FEW DAYS UPON MY RETURN.  WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR TO DRIVE IT NEXT, I SAW THAT THE DASH AND THREE OF THE DOOR PADS HAD COME UNGLUED AND BUCKLED REALLY BADLY.  I TOOK IT BACK TO DAN CUMMINS IN PARIS, KY AS SOON AS I DISCOVERED THAT THE INTERIOR WAS FALLING APART.  THE SERVICE MANAGER REFUSED TO EVEN LOOK AT THE CAR SINCE IT HAD GONE OVER THE 36,000 MILE WARRANTY DURING MY VACATION BEFORE I RETURNED HOME.  HE SUGGESTED I CALL GM AND COMPLAIN TO THEM ABOUT IT.  I DID CALL THEM AND THEY TOOK MY COMPLAINT.  THEY GAVE ME AN COMPLAINT NUMBER, BUT HAVE SINCE REFUSED TO ANSWER THEIR PHONE WHEN I CALL, OR TO CALL ME BACK AFTER I LEAVE THEM A VOICE MAIL ON THEIR MACHINE.    I HAVE CREATED A WEBSITE AT HTTP://WWW.ALERO.INFO IN ORDER FOR INTERESTED PERSONS TO BE ABLE TO VIEW THE PICTURES OF THE POOR FACTORY WORKMANSHIP AND MATERIALS USED TO BUILD MY 2002 ALERO.  THE PICTURES SAY IT ALL AS TO WHAT MY COMPLAINT IS ABOUT WITH THE DASH AND DOOR PADS COMING UNGLUED AND BUCKLING.  AT 37,500 MILES WHILE IT IS STILL ONLY TWO YEARS OLD, IT HAS DEVELOPED AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM THAT COULD POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS AS SOMETHING IS CAUSING THE FUSE TO THE TAIL AND INTERIOR LIGHTS TO BLOW WHILE DRIVING IT AT NIGHT.    *NLM",
