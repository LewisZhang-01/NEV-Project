THEY SPENT 0.60 HRS DIAGNOSING A \"SLIGHTLY WORN LOWER COLUMN SHAFT\".  THEY WERE QUICK TO POINT OUT THAT THIS MAY NOT FIX THE PROBLEM AND THAT PERHAPS I SHOULD CONTINUE DRIVING THE VEHICLE IN HOPE THAT THE SYMPTOMS WOULD BECOME MORE EVIDENT.  I DECLINED ANY REPAIR.  I LATER WENT \"ON-LINE\" AND WAS SURPRISED TO FIND A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN ON THE SUBJECT. (TSB 19-10-97 - \"STEERING WANDER\")  IN ADDITION, I FOUND AN ENTIRE WEB SITE DEDICATED TO THIS PHENOMENA.  (KEY SEARCH, DODGE RAM) THE STORIES ARE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING AND SOME ARE MUCH WORSE - SCARY!  I E-MAILED DAIMLER CHRYSLER AND ASKED IF THEY WERE CONSIDERING ANY SORT OF CORRECTIVE ACTION.  THEIR ANSWER WAS NO. TS",
