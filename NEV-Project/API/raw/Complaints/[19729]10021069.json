CAR WAS FOUND TO HAVE OIL IN PAN WITH \"SLUDGE\" AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN UPON INSPECTION AFTER THE INCIDENT.  VEHICLE NEVER RAN \"HOT.\"  UPON CONSULTATION WITH LOCAL MECHANICS AND THE LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 2.7 ENGINES IN THIS SERIES OF DODGE INTREPID.  MECHANICS AND ENGINE BUILDERS HAVE BOTH ADVISED THAT THIS ENGINE HAS A FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN FLAW IN THE OIL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE ENGINE, EVENTUALLY LEADING TO ENGINE WEAR AND EVENTUAL FAILURE.  CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP (THOUGH UNWILLING TO REPLACE THE ENGINE AT NO COST) OPENLY ADMITS THAT THERE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES WITH THIS ENGINE.  CHRYSLER MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR POORLY DESIGNED ENGINE THAT IS DOOMED FOR PREMATURE FAILURE.*AK",
