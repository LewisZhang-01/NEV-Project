THEY HAD TO BE REPLACED IN THE FIRST YEAR AND A HALF OF OWNERSHIP AND NEVER STOPPED MAKING NOISE.  ON A SEPARATE OCCASION THE REAR WHEEL BEARINGS LEAKED FLUID ALL OVER THE BRAKE PADS WHICH COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A DEADLY ACCIDENT.      I HAVE BEEN GIVEN A COPY OF A LETTER FROM FORD MOTOR CO. FROM A FORD DEALERSHIP SAYING THE BRAKE NOISE IS NORMAL AND CAN NOT BE FIXED AND IS NOT INDICATIVE OF A PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES.  PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO FIX THESE CARS, THEY ARE NOT SAFE!  *JB",
