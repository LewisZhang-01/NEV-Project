OR SOME OTHER CAUSE.       MY 2010 SUBARU OUTBACK HAS HAD ALL RECOMMENDED SERVICES AND HAS ONLY 53K MILES.  NO CHECK ENGINE OR OTHER WARNING LIGHTS HAVE TURNED ON.  YESTERDAY, THE ENGINE STALLED AT TEN STOPS IN A ROW AND THEN EVERY OTHER STOP TIL I GOT HOME.   SO FAR IT HAS RESTARTED BUT BECAUSE THE PROBLEM BEGAN ONLY ONE WEEK AGO AND IS RAPIDLY WORSENING, I AM AFRAID THE ENGINE WILL SOON FAIL TO RESTART OR WILL DIE WHILE MOVING IN TRAFFIC.  MY LOCAL MECHANIC WILL NOT LOOK AT THE CAR BECAUSE OF THE SUBARU EXTENDED WARRANTY SINCE THEY CANNOT FIX IT IF IT IS THE POWERTRAIN. I DON'T WANT TO BE THE FIRST FATALITY THAT EVENTUALLY LEADS TO A RECALL.     IS THERE ANY WAY TO HAVE SUBARU RECALL FOR INSPECTION CARS EXPERIENCING FREQUENT ENGINE STALL PROBLEMS OR OTHER SYMPTOMS OF BAD TORQUE CONVERTERS TO AT LEAST CONFIRM OR RULE OUT A POWERTRAIN DEFECT AS THE CAUSE?",
