        "summary": "JULY 11, 07 I HAD TO TRAVEL FOR WORK AND THREE HOURS OUT THE CAR STOPPED IN THE ROAD AND AT THAT TIME THE CAR CONTINUED TO ROLL SO I MERGED TO THE SIDE TO GET OF THE ROAD, THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND DIDN'T START TILL 30MIN LATER.  I HAD TO TURN BACK AROUND AND HEAD HOME AND THE CAR CONTINUED TO STOP AND START OVER 20 TIMES TILL I MADE IT HOME. AT TIMES IT WOULD NOT PICK UP SPEED OR IT WOULD DECREASE. 07-26-07 I TOOK IT TO A FORD DEALERSHIP SERVICE CENTER AND THEY BROUGHT UP THAT THE PROBLEM WAS IN THE FUEL PUMP, FUEL FILTER AND PC VALVE AND OTHER ITEMS THAT DID NOT PERTAIN TO THE PROBLEM BUT NEEDED FUTURE ATTENTION.  THE LADY WHO HELPED ME TOLD ME I NEED AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE FUEL PUMP AND WAS CHARGED $590.43 FOR EVERYTHING INCLUDING FEES. AUGUST 1ST, 2007 A FRIEND HAD TOLD ME THAT A DEALERSHIP IN HIS AREA WAS REPLACING ALL FUEL PUMPS FOR FORD FOCUS 2001 THAT FAILED WITHIN AN EXTENDED WARRANTY OF 7 YEARS UNDER 100,000 MILES AND THAT THE COMPANY WAS NOT TELLING ANYONE UNTIL THE PART FAILED AND THEY BROUGHT IT IN FOR SERVICE. I LOOKED UP THE CLAIM ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT IT WAS TRUE. I GOT INFORMATION FROM THE DEALERSHIP AND COMPANY THAT MY PARTICULAR VEHICLE NUMBER , WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE REPLACEMENT PROGRAM.  I STILL HAVE NO ANSWER AS TO WHY MY VEHICLE WAS NOT SELECTED WHEN MY CAR CLEARLY SHOWED SYMPTOMS OF THE DEFECTED FUEL PUMP.  THE ANSWER I RECEIVE WAS THAT IT COULD BE A VARIABLE OF REASONS INCLUDING WHERE IT WAS MADE AND WHERE THE PART WAS MADE. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT MY CAR HAS A 3YR WARRANTY AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT THEY COULD ASSIST ME WITH.  THE MORE I TRIED TO GET ANSWERS ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND THE CARS INVOLVED, WHO I CAN SPEAK TO OR WHAT CAN I DO TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE THE MORE THE REPRESENTATIVES GOT AGGRAVATED AND RUDE.  SINCE FORD WOULD NOT PROVIDE ME WITH DETAILS OR HELP WITH MY FUEL PUMP DEFECT I WANTED TO SEEK HELP THROUGH THE NHTSA TO DO AN INVESTIGATION OF MY VEHICLE IN ORDER TO PUSH A RECALL FOR MY MODEL. *TR",
