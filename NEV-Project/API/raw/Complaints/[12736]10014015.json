THE PARKING BRAKE WILL BE OFF AND THE GEAR SHIFT WILL BE IN REVERSE BUT THE VAN WON'T MOVE.  ONLY AFTER REPEATED ATTEMPTS AT PUSHING DOWN ON THE ACCELERATOR WILL THE GEAR POP OUT AND THE VAN FINALLY GO INTO REVERSE.  THE VAN HAS 35000 + MILES AND IS APPROACHING THE END OF THE WARRANTY.  THE DEALER CAN NOT FIND  THE PROBLEM.  WHAT MAKES THIS WORSE IS THAT THE VERY SAME THING HAPPENED AFTER WE BOUGHT THE VAN NEW AND AFTER THREE FAILED ATTEMPTS BY THE DEALER TO FIGURE IT OUT, THEY PUT IN A NEW TRANSMISSION -- AFTER ONLY 900 MILES!  *JB",
