THIS IS A POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE.  THERE OUGHT TO BE A RECALL.    THIS CAR HAS 8 CONTROL ARMS IN TOTAL.  THE PREMATURE FAILURE OF THESE PARTS IS BY NOW WELL KNOWN, QUITE EXPENSIVE, AND POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS, NOT TO MENTION INCONVENIENT TO VW CUSTOMERS.  VW HAS DONE VERY LITTLE TO ADDRESS THIS POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE.   THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO PAY EXORBITANT SUMS, REPEATEDLY, OVER TIME TO REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE PARTS WITH EQUALLY DEFECTIVE PARTS WHICH ALSO FAIL PREMATURELY; THERE IS NO PERMANENT SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.  THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL OR AT THE VERY LEAST VW SHOULD BE FIXING THESE CARS FOR FREE EACH TIME, NO QUESTIONS ASKED.",
