HE WAS IN A ACCIDENT ON 3/05/03 WHEN A CAR PULLED OUT IN FRONT OF HIS TRUCK HE WAS GOING APPROX. 35 TO 40 MPH, HE HIT HER CAR HARD ENOUGH TO FLIP HER CAR ON IT'S SIDE.  MY COMPLAINT/CONCERN IS HIS AIR BAG DID NOT DEPLOY, HE DID HAVE ON A SEAT BELT AND ONLY SUSTAINED MINOR INJURIES.  MY CONCERN IS IF THIS HAD BEEN A MORE SERIOUS ACCIDENT IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH THE AIR BAG NOT DEPLOYING.  MY HUSBAND VOICED HIS CONCERNS WITH THE FORD SERVICE AND REQUESTED THAT THEY EVALUATE THE AIR BAG SYSTEM, THE TECHNICIAN  CLAIMS SINCE THE ACCIDENT WAS NOT HEAD ON OR FULL FRONTAL HIT THAT THIS IS WHY IT DID NOT DEPLOY.  AM UNABLE TO FIND INFO REGARDING THIS,  SO WHY DID IT NOT DEPLOY. IS THIS A DEFECT OR NORMAL.     *NLM",
