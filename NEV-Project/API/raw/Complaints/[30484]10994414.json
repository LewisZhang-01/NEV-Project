        "summary": "MY HUSBAND BACKED THE CAR UP 3 INCHES IN OUR DRIVEWAY AND THE FRONT COIL SPRING BROKE, SHOT THROUGH THE TIRE AND THE TIRE EXPLODED.  WE BOUGHT OUR 2012 ELANTRA IN OCTOBER 2011 AND APPARENTLY THERE WAS A RECALL OF THE 2011 ELANTRAS FOR THIS EXACT ISSUE FOR CARS THAT ARE OWNED IN THE \"SALT BELT\" / COLD WEATHER STATES WHICH IS WHERE WE LIVE, BUT THE RECALL WAS ONLY ISSUED FOR ELANTRAS MANUFACTURED BETWEEN 11/12/10 TO 3/31/11.    MINE IS A 2012 WHICH WAS PURCHASED IN OCTOBER 2011AND MANUFACTURED SOMETIME BETWEEN MARCH 2011 AND OCTOBER 2011.  I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT HYUNDAI, WHICH APPARENTLY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE ISSUE UNTIL AN INCREASE IN WARRANTY CLAIMS ON THE ISSUE STARTED AN INVESTIGATION OF IT IN 2014, CHANGED THE FRONT COIL SPRINGS THEY WERE USING TO MANUFACTURE THE SAME CAR JUST 1 \"YEAR\" NEWER BETWEEN THE END OF THE RECALLED VEHICLE DATE AND THE MANUFACTURE DATE OF MY 2012 ELANTRA.     I NOW HAVE TO REPLACE BOTH, RELATIVELY NEW TIRES, AND FRONT STRUTS AND SPRINGS.    I BELIEVE THE RECALL SHOULD INCLUDE MORE VEHICLE YEARS SINCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO REASON FOR THEM TO CHANGE THE PARTS THEY WERE USING BETWEEN 2011 AND 2012 MODELS IF THEY WERE UNAWARE OF A PROBLEM.  ALSO, A 2012 ELANTRA THAT WAS POSSIBLE MANUFACTURED IN THE RECALL TIME FRAME SHOULD ALSO BE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.",
