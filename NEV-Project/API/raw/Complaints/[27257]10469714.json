        "summary": "MY DAUGHTER ( A TEACHER) WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE ON I94 TO WORK IN 2010 WITH THE SPEED CONTROL SET.  THE VEHICLE SPEED INCREASED AND SHE HIT THE BRAKE, BUT THE ACCELERATOR WAS STUCK AND SHE COULD NOT SLOW THE VEHICLE DOWN AS IT OVER-POWERED THE BRAKE.  SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO AND CALLED 911.  THE POLICE OFFICER TOLD HER TO PUT THE VEHICLE IN NEUTRAL AND TURN THE KEY OFF AFTER SHE GOT THE VEHICLE UNDER CONTROL.  SHE WAS EXTREMELY LUCKY NO ONE WAS AHEAD OF HER ON THE EXPRESSWAY. THE ACCELERATOR REMAINED STUCK AFTER SHE HAD PULLED OFF THE ROAD WITH THE MOTOR OFF.  I WENT TO GET HER AND THE VEHICLE.  I WAS ABLE TO RELEASE THE ACCELERATOR BY HITTING IT HARD WITH MY FOOT. I CAREFULLY DROVE THE VEHICLE HOME.  I WAS ABLE TO RECREATE THE ACCELERATOR STICKING ON THE EXPRESSWAY SEVERAL TIMES.  I REPORTED THIS TO FORD (DEARBORN) AND TOLD THEM THEY HAD A PROBLEM, HOWEVER, THEY DID NOT SEEM INTERESTED IN INVESTIGATING THE ISSUE, AND SUGGESTED I PAY A DEALER TO FIX IT.  I HAVE DRIVEN THE VEHICLE, WITHOUT USING THE SPEED CONTROL AND BEING VERY CAREFUL TO ACCELERATE SLOWLY (AS MY DAUGHTER STILL HAS MY VEHICLE).  BUT, NOW I WILL TAKE IT A DEALER AND FORD (THANKS TO THE GOVERNMENT AND THE VEHICLE SAFETY LAW) WILL PAY TO FIX IT!  *TR",
