I WENT TO THE DEALER SO THEY CAN CHECK IT BUT ONE OF THE GUYS SHOWED ME  A DIAGRAM OF THE BRAKE SYSTEM. HE SAID THAT IT'S BEEN A PROBLEM WITH CR-V AND CIVIC. THEY CAN PUT GREASE ON IT BUT AFTER A WHILE YOU WILL HEAR THAT CLICKING SOUND AGAIN. FOR ME THIS A MAJOR PROBLEM. THEY CALL IT \"SLIDING DISC BRAKES\".   *NLM",
