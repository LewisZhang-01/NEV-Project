DODGE REDESIGNED THEIR ORIGINAL PAPER BASED HEAD GASKET AFTER LEARNING OF FAILURES WHERE COOLANT WAS LEAKING.  REPLACEMENT GASKETS ARE MULTILAYERED METAL DESIGN.  DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF CARS RECEIVED REPLACEMENT GASKETS UNDER WARRANTY PROGRAMS.  RECALL WAS NEVER ISSUED TO ADDRESS REMAINING VEHICLES.  CONSUMER SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE PRODUCT WITHOUT SUCH AN OBVIOUS FAILURE.  I HAVE DOZENS OF OWNERS TO SUPPORT THE CLAIM.  MY VEHICLE HAS ONLY 4K MILES ON IT.  *JB",
