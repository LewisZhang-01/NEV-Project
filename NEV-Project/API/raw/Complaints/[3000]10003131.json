        "summary": "AT APPROX 60,000 MILES MY 1998 DODGE STRATUS, DEVELOPED AN OIL LEAK AT THE HEAD GASKET, A CRACKED EXHAUST MANIFOLD, A TIMING BELT TENSIONER AND COVER THAT HAVE FAILED, A LEAKING WATER PUMP THAT NEEDS REPLACING. MY MECHANIC ESTIMATES $2150.00 TO REPLACE AND REPAIR ALL THESE ITEMS. TO TOP THIS OFF MY MECHANIC TELLS ME THAT IT WILL TAKE 2 TO 3 WEEKS TO GET THE TIMING BELT TENSIONER AND COVER BECAUSE THERE'S A BIG BACK ORDER ON THESE ITEMS. MEANWHILE I'M WITHOUT A CAR!   BY REVEIWING THE COMPLAINTS ON THE WEB, I SEE THAT THIS VEHICLE'S HEAD GASKET WAS REDESIGNED BY CHRYSLER SINCE 1998, ALSO THE TIMING BELT TENSIONER HAS BEEN REDESIGNED. THE CAR HAS BEEN GREAT UP TO THIS POINT. HOWEVER I FEEL, ALL THESE RECENT PROBLEMS ARE CLEARLY PRE-MATURE ESPECIALLY SINCE CHRYSLER HAS HAD TO REDESIGN THE HEAD GASKET AND TENSIONER IN ORDER TO CORRECT THE PROBLEMS WITH THESE ITEMS. SHOULD THERE NOT BE A RECALL ON THE 1998 DODGE STRATUS FOR ALL THESE BREAKDOWNS? DO I HAVE ANY RECOURSE ON THIS? COULD YOU PLEASE HELP OUT. THANK YOU.",
