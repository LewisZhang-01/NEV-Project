I CANNOT FIX THIS BY MYSELF.  THE COST IS 7,000.00.  I HAVE TO DRIVE IT LIKE IT IS AND THIS IS A POTENTIAL DANGER BECAUSE IF THE OIL ISN'T KEPT AT PROPER LEVELS IT COULD FREEZE AND STALL WHILE DRIVING.  THERE IS NO INCIDENT YET BUT CAN BE IF LET THE WAY IT IS.  I HAVE NO OTHER MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION AND CAN'T AFFORD TO REPAIR THE WHOLE BILL.  CHRYSLER IS NOT HELPING OR SHOWING ANY RESPONSIBILITY.  I THINK IT SHOULD BE RECALLED AND GROUNDS FOR CLASS ACTION.   *NLM",
