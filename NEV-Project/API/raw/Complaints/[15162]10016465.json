AFTER A RESTING PERIOD THE PEDAL COMES BACK AGAIN.  FORD HAS TOLD ME THE ONLY WAY TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM WITH MY 1991 M53, 50,000 MILES, IS TO DO A $2,500.00 TO $3,000.00 OVERHAUL OF THE BREAK SYSTEM USING PHONELIC PARTS.     I FEEL IF AN EXTENSIVE OVERHAUL IS REQUIRED AT THIS POINT, IT WAS A SYSTEM DESIGNED TO FAIL.  A SYSTEM DEFECT. THIS PROBLEM COULD HAVE COST THE LIFE OF MY WIFE AND TWO OF MY GRANDCHILDREN AND MYSELF.  I HAVE BEEN RESTRICTED TO DRIVING ON FLATLAND EVER SINCE THIS INSTANCE ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO. I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO GET AN ANSWER OR A CORRECTION BUT NO ONE SEEMS TO HAVE ONE EXCEPT $2,500- $3,000.  I FEEL FORD HAS A RESPONSIBILITY HERE AND SHOULD PAY ALL OR A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE CORRECTION OF THEIR DESIGN ERROR.  *NLM",
