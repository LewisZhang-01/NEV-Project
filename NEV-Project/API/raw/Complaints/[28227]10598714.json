I TOOK IT INTO THE NISSAN DEALER (SANDY SANDSING IN PENSACOLA, FL) AND THEY TOLD ME THE ISSUE/RECALL WAS LIMITED TO THE ALTIMA AND THE XTERRA ONLY AND NOT MY PATHFINDER.  AT 38000 MILES THE FUEL GAUGE ISSUE WAS CONSTANT, BUT IT WAS NOW OUT OF WARRANTY.  FINALLY, NISSAN ISSUED A RECALL AND I WAS UNABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE REPLACEMENT BECAUSE MY MILEAGE WAS OVER THEIR LIMIT.  I AM NOT ASKING TO HAVE THIS SENSOR REPLACED JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT, IT IS INOPERABLE.  NISSAN SHOULD HAVE TO PAY ME FOR THE POOR GAS MILEAGE I GET FROM HAVING TO CONSTANTLY DRIVE WITH A FULL FUEL TANK; BECAUSE THE GAS GAUGE WAS UNRELIABLE.  I WILL NEVER BUY A NISSAN AGAIN.  *TR",
