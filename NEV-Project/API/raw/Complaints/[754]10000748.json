IT STILL CONTINUES TO HAVE PROBLEMS BETWEEN THE SPEEDS OF 12 TO 30 MPH, AGAIN THE PROBLEM PRESENTS ITSELF MOSTLY WHEN THE VEHICLE IS COASTING AND LOSING MOMENTUM. THE VEHICLE WOULD BE SLOWING DOWN WITHOUT ANY AID OF BRAKING OF ANY KIND AND AS THE VEHICLE WOULD ATTEMPT TO DOWN SHIFT, IT WOULD SOMETIMES MAKE A CLANKING NOISE, OR BUCK, OR IN THE MOST EXTREME CASES COMPLETELY STALL OUT.  ALSO THE WIPER SPRAYERS HAVE BROKEN TWICE, AND THE DEALER EXPECTS THEM TO BREAK AGAIN.",
