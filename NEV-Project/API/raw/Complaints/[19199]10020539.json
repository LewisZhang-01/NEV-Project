AT 10,000 MILES, WEAR IS OFTEN SO THE STEEL BELTS SHOW THROUGH. NEITHER HONDA OR BRIDGESTONE (THE TIRE MAKER) IS TAKING ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS.  ALL OF THESE CARS ARE EFFECTED BY THIS PROBLEM, SO THE CAUSE SEEMS TO BE FROM ONE OR MORE BATCHES OF DEFECTIVE TIRES.  IT IS NOT KNOWN HOW MANY INJURIES, DAMAGE, OR FATALITIES HAVE RESULTED. HOWEVER, IT IS BEYOND DISPUTE THAT \"BALD\" TIRES, AND THOSE WITH THE STEEL BELTS IN CONTACT WITH THE ROAD, CONSTITUTE A PUBLIC SAFETY HAZARD THAT YOUR AGENCY SHOULD INVESTIGATE.    *NLM",
