VW IS WELL AWARE OF THIS EPIDEMIC CONDITION AND IS NOT ISSUING A RECALL, NOR HAVE THEY COMMUNICATED ANYTHING TO THEIR COUSTOMERS.  VW HAS NEW REDESIGNED PARTS BUT ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY SO VW IS ONLY REPLACING PARTS IN CARS THAT HAVE FAILED, AND THEN ONLY TO THE COILPACK THAT HAS FAILED NOT IN ALL FOUR.  THIS IS UNNACEPTABLE.  THEY ARE BASICALLY WAITING FOR EVERYONE THAT ONES A CAR WITH THAT ENGINE TO BREAK DOWN ON THE ROAD AND THEN ONLY REPLACE 1 OF THE 4 COILPACKS WITH THE NEW DESIGN.  SO AFTER 3 MORE BREAKDOWNS AND ENDLESS DAYS WAITING FOR PARTS WILL YOUR CAR BE \"TRUSTWORTHY\" AGAIN.",
