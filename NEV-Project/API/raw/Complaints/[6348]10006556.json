INFORMED US NOT TO DRIVE MORE THAN 200 MILES. WE INFORMED THEM WE LIVE 60 MILES AWAY AND WOULD NEED  TO GET HOME AND BACK TO DEALERSHIP ON MONDAY. NO RENTAL CAR WAS OFFERED. WHEN TAKEN BACK TO DEALER FOR REPAIRS THEY REPLACED DIFFERENTIAL. TWO WEEKS LATER WE NOTICED LEAKING AGAIN AND THE CAR WA SHIFTING FUNNY. WE TOOK THE CAR IN FOR REPAIRS. THEY REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION. WE APPROACHED BOTH THE MANUFACTURER AND THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THE  TRANSMISSION, BOTH REFUSED. ABOUT A YEAR LATER I RECEIVED A LETTER IN THE MAIL REGARDING A WARRANTY EXTENSION FOR THE TRANSMISSION FOR ALL 2001 HONDA ACCORDS. APPARENTLY I WAS NOT THE ONLY CONSUMER WHO WAS SOLD A LEMON.
