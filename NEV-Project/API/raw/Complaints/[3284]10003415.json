THE BOLTS THAT CONNECT THE MANIFOLD TO THE ENGINE BLOCK SHEARED OFF. I HAD THE REPAIR DONE IN MAY OF 1998 AND ALSO CONTACTED THE LINCOLN MERCURY DIVISION OF FORD.  I EVEN SENT THEM TWO OF THE SHEARED BOLTS. SINCE THAT TIME, THE BOLTS ON THE FRONT MANIFOLD HAVE SHEARED.  I NEVER EVEN RECEIVED AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM FORD IN RESPONSE TO MY LETTER.  THE ENGINE NOW IS VERY NOISY AND I BROUGHT IT IN TO MY MUFFLER MECHANIC ABOUT 3 WEEKS AGO AND HE NOTED THE SHEARED BOLTS ON THE FRONT OF THE MANIFOLD.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER NHTSA IS DOING ANYTHING ABOUT THIS OR WHETHER YOU ARE AWARE OF ANY SUCCESS WITH FORD IN GETTING THIS PROBLEM TAKEN CARE OF.  IT IS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS.",
