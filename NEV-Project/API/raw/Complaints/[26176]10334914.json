THIS COULD CAUSE THRUST WASHERS TO DROP INTO THE ROTATING FLYWHEEL AT SPEED, LOCKING THE MOTOR AND CAUSING LOSS OF CONTROL.  OLDER AND NEWER MODELS BOTH HAVE A RIDGE IN THE OUTER ENGINE COVER THAT PREVENTS THE IDLER GEAR SHAFT FROM DRIFTING OUT TOO FAR AND LOOSING SUPPORT IN THE INNER ENGINE COVER.  THIS WAS CLEARLY A MACHINING ERROR.    I  INSERTED A SMALL SPACER IN THE HOLE TO PREVENT THE SHAFT FROM MOVING. *TR",
