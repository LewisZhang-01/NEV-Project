THEY SAID  THE TORQUE CONVERTER WAS \"LOCKED UP AND WOULDN'T TURN\" (EVEN THOUGH I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR IN JUST FINE!).  THEY SAID THE  TRANSMISSION HAD TO BE REBUILT.  I GOT THEIR ESTIMATE ALONG WITH ESTIMATES FROM 2 OTHER AUTO REPAIR SHOPS IN TOWN.  I CHOOSE A TRANSMISSION SHOP AND HAD THE CAR TOWED THERE.   THEIR ESTIMATE WAS $1000 LESS THAN FORD SERVICE.  THE NEW MECHANIC SAID THE PROBLEM IS DUE TO POOR DESIGN USING ALUMINUM PARTS THAT CAN'T TAKE THE HEAT.  FORD REFUSES TO REIMBURSE ME CLAIMING THE DENIAL IS DUE TO MY HAVING THE REPAIR DONE BY AN INDEPENDENT TRANS. SHOP AND NOT AT FORD SERVICE WHICH WOULD HAVE COST ME $1000 MORE.  I'M DENIED REIMBURSEMENT BECAUSE I MITIGATED THE DAMAGES.   WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO FAIRNESS AND COMMON SENSE?",
