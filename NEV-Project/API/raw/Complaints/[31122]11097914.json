ON 05/22/18, I HEARD NOISE COMING FROM THE STEERING COLUMN, THE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED ON THE DASHBOARD AND ALL OF THE STEERING-MOUNTED CONTROLS FAILED. THIS OCCURRED WHILE I WAS DRIVING, AND CAN HEAR THE NOISES MOST WHEN TURNING. BASED ON MY RESEARCH AND TALK WITH OTHER VW DRIVERS, IT APPEARS TO BE THE CLOCK SPRING (WHICH HAD A RECALL ON IT, AND WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN FIXED). I UNDERSTAND THERE IS NO ACTIVE RECALL ON THIS ISSUE, HOWEVER, DOES THIS NOT INDICATE THE RECALL PERFORMED FAILED? THAT BEING SAID, I DONT FEEL SAFE DRIVING AROUND IN A VEHICLE THAT SAYS MY AIRBAG WONT DEPLOY IF I AM IN AN ACCIDENT.",
