SHORTLY AFTER THAT IT CAME ON AGAIN. THEN BACK IN FEBRUARY THE CAR STARTED MAKING A VERY ANNOYING AND EMBARRASSING CLICKING SOUND THAT COMES FROM THE AC/HEATING UNIT. I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS COMMON IN THE IMPALA AND THAT IT IS THE ACTUATOR. IT HAS GOTTEN SO BAD THAT IT CLICKS EVEN WHEN THE CAR IS NOT RUNNING AND IS LOCKED. I KNOW AT LEAST 7 PEOPLE HERE LOCALLY THAT HAS THE SAME PROBLEMS AS LISTED ABOVE WITH THE SAME YEAR AND MODEL CAR. PLEASE TAKE A SURVEY OR DO SOMETHING BECAUSE THIS IS DEFINITELY A MANUFACTURING ISSUE.  *TR",
