MY CAR HAS THE SAME 2.2L 4 CYLINDER ENGINE THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS SLUDGE PROBLEM.      IN RECOGNITION OF THE PROBLEM WITH THESE ENGINES, TOYOTA AGREED TO COVER THE COST OF REPAIRING THOSE ENGINES IN THEIR 1997-2001 MODELS. HOWEVER, DESPITE THE FACT THAT MY CAR HAS THE SAME ENGINE AND IT WAS PRODUCED TWO MONTHS PRIOR TO THAT TIME FRAME, BECAUSE IT IS IN A 1996 MODEL TOYOTA HAS REFUSED TO COVER THE COST OF REPAIRING IT.    THERE IS NO DISPUTING THAT THE FAILURE OF THOUSANDS OF THESE ENGINES   AS A RESULT OF A BUILD-UP OF OIL SLUDGE CAN BE ATTRIBUTABLE ONLY TO THE FACT THAT THESE ENGINES ARE DEFECTIVE.  AS SUCH, IT IS ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS THAT TOYOTA SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE REPAIR OF SOME OF THESE DEFECTIVE ENGINES AND NOT OTHERS.    THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.    GARY LEVINE.             *NLM",
