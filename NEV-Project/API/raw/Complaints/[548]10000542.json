THE DEALER INFORMED ME THAT MY CLOCKSPRING NEEDED REPLACEMENT, BUT THAT MY VEHICLE IS NOT COVERED BY THE CURRENT RECALL.  I FIND THE EXPLANATION THAT MY PROBLEM IS \"COINCIDENTAL\" TO THE RECALL OF THE 1996-1998 VEHICLES SOMEWHAT DUBIOUS.  IF THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THE CLOCKSPRING WAS INSTALLED OFF CENTER ON THE EARLIER VEHICLES CAUSING A SUBSEQUENT FAILURE, IS IT NOT LIKELY THAT MY PROBLEM WAS SIMILARLY CAUSED, WARRANTING A REPAIR AT CHRYSLER'S EXPENSE?",
