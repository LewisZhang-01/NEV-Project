I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AFTER FIRST INCIDENT PAID 300 DOLLARS FOR THEM TO LOOK AT IT AND THEY TOLD ME COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG. THEN IT HAPPEND AGAIN THE SECOND TIME IN A BUSY INTERSECTION WITH MY FOUR YOUNG GRANDCHILDREN IN THE CAR. THERE WAS A RECALL IN 2017 FOR THE SAME PROBLEM FOR THIS YEAR VEHICLE BUT THEY ARE CLAIMING MINE ISN'T UNDER THAT RECALL AND REFUSING TO FIX IT. BOTH TIMES IT HAS HAPPEND THE POWER STEERING COMPLETELY GOES OUT AND THE TRUCK POWER SHUTS DOWN AND LOCKS UP ANYTHING CONNECTED TO THE TRUCK. ( FOR EXAMPLE MY PHONE WAS CHARGING AND IT LOCKED UP MY PHONE AFTER IT DID THIS) I AM CONCERNED ABOUT MY SAFETY WHILE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE AND CANNOT GET THE CHEVY(GENERAL MOTORS) DEALERSHIP TO HELP ME. THEY ARE CLAIMING NOT TO HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE RECALL IN 2017 AT ALL. I'VE ONLY HAD THIS TRUCK FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND IT HAS DONE THIS TO ME NOW 2 TIMES IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. BOTH TIMES IN VERY BUSY AREAS WHERE MY TRUCK STALLS AND LOOSES POWER STEERING.",
