I HAVE READ MANY FORUMS AND ONLINE ARTICLES ABOUT GM HAVING THIS PROBLEM ON MANY OTHER GM VEHICLES.  THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM WHICH CAN RESULT IN A FIRE SINCE THE WIRE GETS HOT IT CAN POSSIBLY IGNITE THE PADDING UNDERNEATH THE SEAT.  I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO FIX THIS MYSELF IT SHOULD BE REPAIRED BY THE DEALER.  I CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT 47K MILES ON MY CADILLAC AND THE HEAT AND COOL SEATS NO LONGER WORK UNLESS I MAKE THE REPAIRS.  *TR",
