I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEM AROUND WHEN I TRY AND SELL THE TRUCK. THE NOISE CAME AFTER THE TRUCK WAS ONLY 4 MONTHS OLD. IT HAS BEEN GETTING WORSE AND WORSE. MY RESALE VALUE IS GOING TO SUCK. IF IT IS NORMAL, I TOLD THEM THEY SHOULD ADVERTISE IT IN THEIR TV COMMERCIAL.   CHEV TRUCKS, LIKE A ROCK, AND SOUND LIKE A ROCK SHAKING IN A TIN CAN. *JB",
