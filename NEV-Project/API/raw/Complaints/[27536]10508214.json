THIS CREATES A DANGEROUS SITUATION AS THE BUTTONS CAN NOT BE SEEN IN THE DARK.    GM IS AWARE OF THE SITUATION AND HAS REPAIRED IT IN MODELS BUILT AFTER OCTOBER 25 2012, BUT WILL NOT FIX IT IN THE MODELS BUILT BEFORE THEN. WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN NOVEMBER OF 2012, I WAS NOT INFORMED OF THE CHANGE BEFORE THE PURCHASE, LEADING ME TO BELIEVE THAT GM AND ITS DEALERS INTENTIONALLY MISLEAD ME INTO BUYING A CAR THAT THEY HAD ALREADY DEEMED AS HAVING AN UNSAFE FEATURE OR THEY WOULD NOT HAVE CHANGED IT.  *TR",
