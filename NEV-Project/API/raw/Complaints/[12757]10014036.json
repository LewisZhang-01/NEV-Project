WHEN I CALL THE MANUFACTURE THEY SAY I HAD TO DRIVE THE CAR TO A DEALER MY CAR WAS ALREADY AT A REPAIR SHOP.  TANK WAS BROKEN IN HALF AND ALL MY GAS WAS LEAKING. I HAD BEEN DRIVING AROUND FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG WITH THIS PROBLEM I DRIVE FOUR CHILDREN AT ALL TIMES. WHEN I WAS GOING TO PURCHASE THIS VAN, I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH AND I CHOOSE THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE IT WAS THE MOST RELIABLE CAR. I AM VERY UPSET WITH THE FACT THAT I HAVE TO PUT SO MUCH MONEY INTO THIS CAR TO REPLACE PARTS THAT SHOULD STILL BE IN GREAT CONDITION.*JB",
