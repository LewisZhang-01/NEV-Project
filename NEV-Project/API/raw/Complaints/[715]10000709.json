I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER WHO INDICATED THAT DIAGNOSTIC CODES REQUIRE THE MAIN ABS COMPUTER MODULE TO BE REPLACED. WHEN THE LIGHT IS LIT, THE ABS SYSTEM IS INOPERATIVE. THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD. THE LIGHT OCCAISIONALLY DOES GO OFF AFTER SELF DIAGONOSTICS, ABOUT 2% OF THE TIME.     HONDA CLAIMS THERE IS NO RECALL ON THIS VEHICLE, EVEN THOUGH ISUZU INDICATES THAT THEIR RODEO, WHICH IS THE SAME VEHICLE AND MODEL YEAR DOES HAVE A VOLUNTARY RECALL IN PLACE FOR FAULTY ABS MODULE, WHICH ALTHOUHG IT APPEARS UNRELATED TO THIS PROBLEM, WOULD ALSO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AS THE ABS MODULE IS REPLACED IN THIS SAFETY CAMPAIGN.",
