WHEN I FINALLY REACHED MY DESTINATION, THE ENGINE DIED FOR GOOD AND THE MOTOR HOME WAS TOWED TO A REPAIR FACILITY.  THE FAILURE TURNED OUT TO BE A SHORTING OUT WIRE IN THE FUEL TANK IN THE FUEL TANK SENDING UNIT.  MY CONCERN IS THAT AN ELECTRICAL SPARK IN A GAS TANK IS A BOMB.  THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INVESTIGATION BEFORE SOMEONE IS INJURED OR KILLED.*JB",
