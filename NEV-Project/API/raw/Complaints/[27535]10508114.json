MECHANIC SAID IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO BEND THE DRIVESHAFT UNLESS THE VEHICLE IS IN A MAJOR ACCIDENT.  I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF VEHICLE AND IT HAS NEVER BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT.  I HAVE HEARD A THUMPING NOISE IN THE REAR OF VEHICLE WHEN SLOWING DOWN FOR THE PAST 6 YRS.   SEVERAL SHOPS AND DEALERSHIP WERE UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE ISSUE.      *TR",
