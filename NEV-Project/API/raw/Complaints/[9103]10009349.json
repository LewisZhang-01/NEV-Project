THE VEHICLE SHIMMIES SO MUCH WHEN YOU APPLY THE BRAKES THAT YOU HAVE A HARD TIME CONTROLLING THE STEERING. IT SEEMS THAT THE FRONT ROTORS ARE OVER HEATING AND WARPING AFTER ABOUT 4-6K MILES. THE DEALERSHIP REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT EXCEPT TO TURN ROTORS AGAIN. THIS WILL LAST ABOUT 4-6K MILES AND THEY WARP AGAIN.*TS      *JB  ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12-12-02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS***762447",
