ON AT LEAST 5 OCCASIONS IN THE 16 MONTHS WE HAVE OWNED IT, IT HAS UNEXPECTEDLY STALLED WHILE DRIVING, MOST RECENTLY IN AN INTERSECTION.  THE DEALER (H&H CHEVROLET) HAS BEEN OF NO HELP AS THEY CANNOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG.  I SEE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST 6 IDENTICAL COMPLAINTS LODGED WITH YOUR OFFICE FOR THIS VERY PROBLEM (SEE COMPLAINT NOS. 10001257, 10001548, 10001584, 10002244, 10004168, 10014614), SO IT IS NOT UNIQUE TO MY VEHICLE.  CLEARLY IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT HAPPENS IN AN INTERSECTION (LIKE IT DID FOR US) OR ON THE HIGHWAY AS IN SOME OF THE OTHER COMPLAINTS.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THE MANUFACTURER HAS FOUND A SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM.  THANKS!*AK",
