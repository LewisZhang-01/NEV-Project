HAVING INVESTIGATED THE REQUIREMENTS FOR REPAIR,  I HAVE FOUND THAT NEARLY ALL GM CARS WITH THIS MOUNTING SYSTEM ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME MALFUNCTION. THIS IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE, IN THAT THE ENGINE CRADLE CAN FALL FROM THE VEHICLE. IN MY OPINION THIS IS THE RESULT OF A DESIGN OR MATERIALS FAILURE, INCORPORATED WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS MANUFACTURED.THE REPAIR COST OF THE PARTS, FROM GM \"DEALER ONLY\", IS PROHIBITIVE. IS THIS BEING CONSIDERED FOR A MANDATORY RECALL.?",
