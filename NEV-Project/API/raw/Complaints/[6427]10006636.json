I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THIS IS AN ABS ACTIVATION, HOWEVER, I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THIS IS NORMAL ABS OPERATION.  WHEN I REAR ENDED THE VEHICLE, I WAS DECELERATING AND ROLLED OVER A DEPRESSED MANHOLE IN THE ROADWAY CAUSING THE BRAKING FAILURE.  I CAN REPRODUCE THE FAILURE ANYTIME.  I HAVE HAD ISUZU DEALERS TEST DRIVE THE VEHICLE, AND THEY TELL ME THIS IS NORMAL ABS ACTIVATION.  I HAVE DRIVER FOUR-WHEEL ANTI-LOCK BREAK VEHICLE'S AND HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS BEFORE.  IT HAS CAUSED ME TO ROLL THROUGH RED LIGHTS ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS DUE TO ROLLING OVER ROAD WAY DEFECTS WHILE BREAKING.  IF ABS IS SUPPOSE TO SHORTEN MY BREAKING DISTANCE IN LIEU OF A SKID CONDITION, I'D RATHER GO INTO A SKID. AT LEAST THEN I WILL HAVE SOME CONTROL OVER MY BREAKING.  PLEASE HELP... I SERIOUSLY DOUBT THIS IS NORMAL FOR ABS.    *JB    ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*****770768",
