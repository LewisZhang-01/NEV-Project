AFTER 3 TRIPS IN A MONTH TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY FINALLY FOUND THE PROBLEM, IT WAS THE PCM MODULE..... I CALLED FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND INFORMED THEM THAT AFTER DOING RESEARCH ONLINE THAT I HAVE NOTICED THAT THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE WITH MANY OWNERS..... THEY SAID THAT IF ENOUGH PEOPLE CALL IN AND INFORM IT WILL GET ADDRESSED BY NHTSA...SO IF YOU ARE HAVING THIS PROBLEM OR HAVE HAD IT PLEASE CALL IN. KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS FOR ANY REPAIRS DONE DUE TO THIS AND IF THERE IS A RECALL AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE BEFORE SOMEONE DIES DUE TO IT. WE WILL BE REIMBURSED FOR OUR REPAIR COSTS.  *TR",
