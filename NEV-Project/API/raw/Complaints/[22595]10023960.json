IT RIPPED OUT OF MY HANDS AND SENT ME RIGHT ON ONTO SOMEONE'S FRONT LAWN NEARLY MISSING A TREE. I REGAINED CONTROL JUST IN TIME AND GOT IT BACK ON THE ROAD. I LIMPED IT HOME AND PARKED IT. I CALLED THE DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM AND DID NOT BELIEVE ME AND WOULD NOT HELP, SO I STARTED LOOKING FOR A DIFFERENT VEHICLE WITH HELP FROM MY PARENTS. FOUND A DEALER SHIP 3 CITIES AWAY AND SAID BRING IT IN AND WE'LL HELP YOU. THEY CALLED IN SAGINAW STEERING PLANT REP. AND IT DID IT TO HIM AND SAID WE'LL REPLACE FOR FREE JUST PAY LABOR. SEEING IT WAS NOT COVERED BY MY EXTENDED WARRANTY I ACCEPTED AND TRADED IT IN ON A S-10 PICK-UP.   *NLM",
