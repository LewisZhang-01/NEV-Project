I WAS GOING HOME IN LEFT LANE AND TWO SPEEDING CARS PAST ME AND CUT ME OFF, DIDN'T STOP AND I HIT A METAL RAIL.  I'M VERY UPSET BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE BEEN FATAL. THE CAR IS A 99 CHEVROLET MALIBU WHICH WE PURCHASED FROM CARMAX AND THEY SAID THEY SOLD US A CAR WITH NO DEFECTS.  WHERE DO SEARCH FOR ANSWERS?  THE CAR IS REPARABLE BUT MIGHT NOT BE IN THE SAME CONDITION WHEN I GET IT BACK.  I'M VERY HAPPY I DIDN'T HAVE MY CHILDREN IN THAT CAR THEN.   *NLM",
