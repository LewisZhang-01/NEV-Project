        "summary": "I WAS RECENTLY DRIVING MY 1996 CHEVROLET MONTE CARLO LS (VIN # [XXX]) ON THE HIGHWAY DURING A HEAVY RAINSTORM. I KEEP NOTICING THAT THE BRAKES FELT LIKE THEY WERE NOT WORKING WHEN I APPLIED BRAKE PRESSURE. AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE BRAKES WOULD BEGIN TO FEEL AS THOUGH THEY WERE FUNCTIONING AND THE CAR WOULD SLOW DOWN.     AFTER NOTICING THIS PROBLEM, I SEARCHED FOR RECALLS ON MY VEHICLE AND CONTACTED MY DEALER. THE DEALER'S RECORDS SHOWED THAT THERE WERE NO RECALLS ON MY VEHICLE. HOWEVER, THE NHTSA WEB SITE INDICATED TWO PROBLEMS. ONE WAS A RECALL, WHICH APPLIES ONLY TO VEHICLES MANUFACTURED DURING A SPECIFIC TIME PERIOD. THE OTHER NOTICE WAS FOR A SAFETY IMPROVEMENT CAMPAIGN (APPARENTLY DIFFERENT FROM A RECALL).     THE NHTSA NUMBER FOR THIS CAMPAIGN IS 011014000. THE NHTSA WEBSITE STATES THAT THIS CAMPAIGN ONLY APPLIES TO THE Z34 VERSION OF THE 1996 MONTE CARLO. THE PROBLEM THAT IS DESCRIBED IS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED WHEN DRIVING MY LS MONTE CARLO IN WET CONDITIONS. IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THE Z34 AND THE LS VERSIONS OF THE 1996 MONTE CARLO HAVE IDENTICAL FENDER WELLS AND LINERS AND WOULD EXPERIENCE IDENTICAL WET BRAKING PROBLEMS, THEREBY REQUIRING THE SAME FENDER LINER MODIFICATION. THUS, THIS SAFETY PROBLEM IS NOT LIMITED TO THE ONLY Z34 MODEL AND THIS CAMPAIGN SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO ALL 1995-1999 CHEVROLET MONTE CARLO VEHICLES.     I WOULD LIKE THE MANUFACTURER TO MODIFY MY VEHICLE SO THAT I WILL NOT EXPERIENCE WET BRAKE FADING AND BE ABLE TO PROPERLY STOP MY CAR WHEN DRIVING IN WET CONDITIONS.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
