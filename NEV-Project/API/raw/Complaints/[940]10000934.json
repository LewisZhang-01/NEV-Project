THE VEHICLE HAS STALLED AT LEAST TEN TIMES IN THE FIRST 1174 MILES OF OWNERSHIP.  OCCURS WITH GREATER FREQUENCY IN WARM WEATHER WHILE THE ENGINE IS HOT.       TWO SERVICE DEPARTMENTS CHECKED THE ENGINE AND ONE RESET THE IDLE CONTROLLER.  THEY COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE CONDITION, HOWEVER, THE STALLING PERSISTS WITH NO CHANGE IN SYMPTOMS.  ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE RESTARTS IMMEDIATELY, THE CONDITION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE CHANCES OF A COLLISION WHILE TRYING TO REGAIN CONTROL AND RESTART IN TRAFFIC.",
