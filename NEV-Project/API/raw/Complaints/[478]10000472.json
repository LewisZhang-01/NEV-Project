        "summary": "FUEL/THROTTLE CONTROL: I EXPERIENCED A \"SUDDEN UNINTENDED ACCELERATION\" INCIDENT IN JULY OF 2002. I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF HEAD IN PARKING AND WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY WHILE APPLYING BRAKES THE VEHICLE ACCELERATED OVER CURBING INTO A WALL. THE VEHICLE STOPPED, THE ENGINE STOPPED RUNNING, AND AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. THE VEHICLE IS A 2001 NISSAN PATHFINDER WITH LESS THAN 8,000 MILES ON IT. I HAVE READ OF OTHER INCIDENTS LIKE THIS FOR THIS VEHICLE AND AM NOW AFRAID TO DRIVE IT. NO OTHER INCIDENT HAS OCCURED. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCE THIS SITUATION BEFORE AND I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT THAT I STEPPED ON THE ACCELETATOR THE SAME TIME AS THE BRAKE. NOW I BELIEVE I DID NOT STEP ON THE ACCELERATOR BUT FOR SOME REASON THE VEHICLE MALFUNCTIONED. I HAVE NOT TAKEN THIS INTO THE DEALER BECAUSE I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ABILITY TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM AS IT APPEARS TO BE VERY INTERMITTENT. THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT IS POTENTIALLY LETHAL AND CANNOT BE DETECTED BY NORMAL MAINTENANCE AND HAPPENS SO QUICKLY THAT THE DRIVER CANNOT REACT TO AVOID A SERIOUS COLLISION. THERE WERE NO INJURIES (THIS TIME) BUT VEHICLE DAMAGE WAS $500.",
