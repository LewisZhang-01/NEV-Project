        "summary": "EGR VALVE KEEPS GETTING CLOGGED WITH DEBRIS FROM CATALYTIC CONVERTER CAUSING TRUCK TO RUN ROUGH AND STALL.  WHEN VALVE IS STUCK OPEN BRAKES ALSO FAIL.  THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROBLEM SINCE I PURCHASED THE USED VEHICLE IN 5/00.  IT ONLY HAD 68,000 MI.  I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE BUT IT HAD LIMIT OF 75,000 MI AND I HAD 78,000 WHEN I RECEIVED IT AND THE DEALER WOULD ONLY FIX IT IF I PAID FOR IT.  I KNOW THERE IS A REPLACEMENT KIT BECAUSE THEY TOLD ME THERE WAS.  THEY SAID THAT SOME KIND OF SCREEN NEEDS TO BE FITTED TO KEEP PIECES OF CARBON BUILDUP FROM BEING SUCKED INTO TO EGR VALVE FROM THE CONVERTER.  THIS SEEMS LIKE AN EASY AND SIMPLE FIX. EVERYONE I TALK TO WHO HAS THE SAME ENGINE HAS THE SAME PROBLEM.  I AM APPALLED THAT MANUFACTURES CAN PUT A MILEAGE LIMIT ON THEIR RECALLS!  ESPECIALLY WHEN BRAKES ARE INVOLVED.  AFTER LOOKING THROUGH YOUR LIST AND I'VE SEEN HOW MANY COMPLAINTS YOU HAVE ON FILE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WHY ISN'T ANYTHING BEING DONE!!  DOES SOMEONE HAVE TO DIE TO GET YOUR ATTENTION!  I PRAY EVERYTIME MY TRUCK STARTS ACTING UP THAT ME AND MY 9-YR. OLD DAUGHTER GET SOMEWHERE SAFE BEFORE WE HAVE AN ACCIDENT.  THIS IS NOT RIGHT.  YOU ARE OUR ONLY HOPE.  PLEASE DO SOMETHING TO MAKE GM CORRECT THIS PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE DIES.   *NLM",
