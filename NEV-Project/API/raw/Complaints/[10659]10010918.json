WHY IS THE NHTSA.DOT NOT FORCING MAZDA TO RECALL OR PAY DAMAGES TO THE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF FOLKS LIKE ME WHO ARE OUT THOUSANDS FOR REPEATED TRANSMISSION FAILURES? BOUGHT USED CAR FROM TRANSMISSION SHOP OWNER 2 YEARS AGO NOW. HE WARRANTED TRANSMISSION (CLAIMED \"NEW\") ONE YEAR. THIS ITSELF SHOWS TRANSMISSION WAS FAILED AND REPLACED ONCE ALREADY.  BROUGHT IT IN TWICE UNDER WARRANTY, TOLD ME \"HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WORK WAS DONE BECAUSE MECHANIC WAS NOT IN THAT DAY\". FOR ALL I KNOW, HE DID NOTHING AND WAITED UNTIL WARRANTY LAPSED ON PURPOSE. NOW AFTER WARRANTY ON TRANSMISSION COMPLETELY FAILED. FLUID WAS BLACK SIGN OF BURNING. ONLY 2ND YEAR FROM PURCHASE NOW, EXPENSIVE PRICE. UNMATCHING FORD TRANSMISSION HAS DIFFERENT LIQUID/PRESSURE SPECS WHICH DO NOT MATCH MAZDA ENGINE SPECS. THIS IS HOW MAZDA IS SELLING IT, THE TWO PARTS DON'T WORK TOGETHER. THIS IS WHY EVEN THE \"REBUILDS\" AND \"REPLACEMENTS\" STILL FAIL 1-2 YEARS.(RIDICULOUS!!!!)  THE WEBSITE WWW.CARREVIEWS.COM CONTAINS HUNDREDS OF SIMILAR HORROR STORIES ABOUT THIS TRANSMISSION ON THIS MODEL, ALL AUTOMATIC. EXPLODING TRANSMISSION FLUID ON MY WAY HOME FROM REPAIR/REPLACE, FAILING AT ONLY 100 MILES ON BRAND NEW MAZDA FOR ANOTHER NEW BUYER!!!!, 3-4-5 REPLACEMENTS PER CONSUMER IN 2-3 YEARS IS THE MOST TYPICAL COMPLAINT!!! THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING TO PUNISH THEM< THEY KNOW ALL ABOUT IT!!!!! WHY IS THERE NO INVESTIGATION IN YOUR INVESTIGATIONS PAGE?",
