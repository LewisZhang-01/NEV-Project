        "summary": "I HAVE HAD TWO INCIDENTS OF MY JEEP RENEGADE(9 SPEED AUTOMATIC) STALLING ON ME WHEN STOPPED AND IN DRIVE AND WHEN IN PARK. THE ENGINE WOULD SHUTTER INTERMITTENTLY. I NOTICE THAT WHEN IN PARK THE TACHOMETER WOULD REV UP WITHOUT THE GAS PEDAL BEING PRESSED DOWN. I WOULD HAVE TO PUT CAR IN PARK AT STOPS OR RED LIGHTS TO RESTART CAR AND PUT BACK INTO DRIVE TO GET GOING. EVEN THEN THE CAR WOULD LAG TRYING TO GET BACK UP TO SPEED. IT WOULD SHUTTER WHEN DRIVING AT LOW MPH. THIS IS HORRIBLE AND I AM AFRAID I WILL GET INTO AN ACCIDENT. MY DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT WHEN I HAD THE PROBLEM THE FIRST TIME( AFTER I DROVE RIGHT OF THE LOT). SO HERE IT IS A MONTH AND HALF LATER AND THE PROBLEM HAS RETURNED BUT WORSE THAN BEFORE. I AM TAKING THE CAR BACK TO SERVICE AGAIN. HOWEVER, I AM GOING TO ASK FOR THEM TO TOW JEEP BECAUSE THIS CAR IS UNPREDICTABLE RIGHT NOW TO BE DRIVEN SAFELY!",
