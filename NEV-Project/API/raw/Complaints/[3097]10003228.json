WE HAD AN EXPERIENCE WITH OUR 2002 ENVOY WHERE ON THURS. 12/19 MY HUSBAND WAS ACCELERATING OFF OF A TAKE OFF RAMP ONTO THE BELTWAY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN HE HEARD A LOUD CLATTERING NOISE.  HE PULLED OVER TO THE SHOULDER AND COULD NOT GO ANY FURTHER.  WE HAD IT TOWED TO THE GMC DEALER AND THEY DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS A DRIVE TRAIN FAILURE WITH PIECES FOUND DOWN TO THE SIX CYCLINDER HEAD.  THEY ARE REPLACING THE ENGINE WITH AN \"UPDATED\" ENGINE, WHICH MEANS TO ME THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE FIRST RUN ENGINES.  ACCORDING TO COMPLAINTS POSTED TO YOUR WEBSITE THIS HAS HAPPENED TO LOTS OF PEOPLE.   WHEN IS THE RECALL COMING?  STOPPING ABRUPTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY IS VERY DANGEROUS.  DOES IT TAKE SOMEONE TO GET KILLED BEFORE A RECALL CAN BE DONE?  WE ARE IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH GMC AT THIS TIME.  I WOULD LIKE A RESPONSE TO MY E-MAIL.",
