        "summary": "WE  BOUGHT OUR CAR NEW FROM GLADSTONE DODGE, AND NOTICED RIGHT OFF THAT THERE WAS AN HESITATION AND LUNGING IN THE TRANSMISSION. THIS PROBLEM WAS RANDOM, YOU NEVER KNEW WHEN IT WOULD HAPPEN.WHEN WE TOOK IT IN ANYWAYS TO BE CHECKED  THE WROTE IT UP AS THEY \"COULD NOT VERIFY\" AND NEXT TIME \"COULD NOT DUPLICATE\" .  WE KEPT CALLING AND INSISITING THERE WAS SOMETHING.  WE WERE TOLD TO BRING IT IN WHEN IT WAS DOING IT.THEY REPLACED THE CAM SENSORS AND SAID THAT WAS PROBLEM, NOT THE TRANSMISSION ITSELF.  THEN WARRANTY EXPIRED WE PAID FOR THE NEXT SENSOR. THEY SAID STILL NOT THE TRANSMISSION. NOW AT 60,000MILES THE TRANSMISSION IS COMPLETELY GONE.  DAIMLERCHRYSLER REFUSES TO PAY SAYING THAT THE TECH COULD NOT VERIFY OR DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. EVEN THOUGH WE TRIED TO TELL THEM ON SEVERAL TIMES, THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG FROM THE BEGINNING.  2 MONTHS AGO WE WERE SHOWN  THICK SLUDGE IN THE OIL ON A ROUTINE OIL CHANGE, NOW AFTER RESEARCH  I SEE IN A COMPLAINT SITE FOR DODGE INTREPIDS  THAT THERE ARE 1,000 THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH TECHS \"UNABLE TO VERIFY OR DUPLICATE\" AND CUSTOMER KEEP INSISTING THERE IS A PROBLEM, SENSORS REPLACED AND ONLY TO FOLLOW WITH TRANSMISSION TOTALLY GOING OUT.  AND WITH THE SLUDGE  THE ENGINE ENDS UP BLOWN.  SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE!!!",
