NOW, WHENEVER THERE IS A PASSENGER, THE AIR BAG FOR THE PASSENGER SIDE SHOWS AS OFF.    MY VEHICLE IS AN '07, BUT HAS ONLY 50,000 MILES. THE SENSOR APPEARS TO BE VERY THIN AND FLIMSY. WITH THIS ITEM BROKEN, IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT, THE AIR BAG WOULD NOT DEPLOY EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A PASSENGER IN THE SEAT. THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW AND IS VERY DANGEROUS.     A SIMILAR RECALL WAS MADE ON THIS ITEM FOR THE CADILLAC LINE.    THANK YOU  *TR",
