IN JUNE OF 2018 (TWO YEARS LATER) I RECEIVED ANOTHER LETTER TELLING ME TO GO TO MY DEALER FOR THEM TO ORDER PARTS.  I WENT TO MY LOCAL DEALER IN GOSHEN, INDIANA AND THEY TOOK THE INFORMATION AND SAID THEY WOULD CALL WHEN THE REPAIRS COULD BE MADE.  IT IS JANUARY 2019 AND I HAVE NOT HEARD ONE WORD.  THEY SAY THE PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE \"YET\".  THIS IS RIDICULOUS.  DON'T OFFER A RECALL IF YOU ARE NOT PREPARED TO FIX THE VEHICLES.",
