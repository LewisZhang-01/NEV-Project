        "summary": "I HAVE A 1999 CHEVORLET MALIBU WITH 73,000 MILES.  I HAVE PERFORMED ALL PREVENTIVE  MAINTAINCE ON THE CAR. ON 12/31/02, I NOTICED A SMALL PUDDLE OF ENGINE COOLANT UNDER THE CAR. I TOOK IT TO MY REGULAR MECHANIC. I WAS ADVISED AFTER A DIAGNOSTIC TEST I HAD A LEAK AT THE INTAKE GASKET. THE TOTAL COST TO REPAIR WAS $596.00. AFTER RESEARCHING ON THE INTERNET, I HAVE LEARNED OF MANY OWNERS OF A GENERAL MOTERS (GM) VECHICLE HAVING SIMILIAR PROBLEMS.     I FEEL IT IS TIME FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO STEP IN AND INVESTIGATE GM. GM ADMITS NO WRONG DOING THOUGH THERE IS SUFFICIENT PROOF TO SHOW A FAULTY DESIGN IN THE INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET. I HAVE DONE MOST OF MY OWN PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE AS WELL AS REPAIR. I AM FAMILIAR WITH AUTOMOBILE ENGINES ENOUGH TO KNOW IF AN ENGINE IS PROPERLY DESIGNED AND HAS THE CORRECT GASKETS, SEALANT, AND PROPER ASSEMBLY LEAKS SUCH AS THE ONE I DESCRIBED SHOULD BE RARE.     THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME TO READ AND I HOPE YOUR DEPARTMENT WILL WORK TO HELP CONSUMERS WITH THIS PROBLEM.",
