VW KNOWS ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND IS DOING NOTHING. MOREOVER, VW KNOWS IT'S THE TORQUE CONVERTER AS THEY SENT OUT A SOFTWARE UPDATE TO UNSOLD JETTA'S TO DEALERS  BUT AREN'T DOING ANYTHING TO ALREADY SOLD JETTAS. ONLY SAYING THESE NOISES ARE NORMAL. THIS DEFECTIVE CONVERTER IS ON HUNDREDS OR EVEN THOUSANDS OF JETTA AND EVERYONE IS HAVING THE SAME ISSUE.  IT'S DANGEROUS AND A SAFETY ISSUE.AND DAMAGING THE TRANSMISSION",
