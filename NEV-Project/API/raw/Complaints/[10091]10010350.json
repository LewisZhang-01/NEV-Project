FOUND OUT THE POSITIVE CHARGE WAS BROKEN FROM BATTERY.  SIX MONTH'S LATER ON JANUARY 19.  MY ABS LIGHT COMES ON AND I LOSE ALL POWER ON SNOW AND ICE.  LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO KEEP CONTROL OF MY CAR AND GET IT STOPPED.  IF THERE WOULD BE A BEEN ANOTHER CAR COMING TOWARDS ME I WOULD HAVE HIT THEM HEAD ON.  I HAD IT TOWED THE FOLLOWING DAY, AND THEY SAID MY BATTERY WAS LEAKING ACID AND MY TIMING BELT WAS BREAKING.  I HAVE ONLY HAD MY CAR A YEAR AND I BOUGHT IT FROM A DEALERSHIP.  WHAT'S CAUSING THE BATTERY TO LEAK ACID?  I AM SCARED TO DEATH IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN AND NEXT TIME I WON'T BE SO LUCKY.*JB",
