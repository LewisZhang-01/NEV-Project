THIS FIRESTONE TIRE IS STANDARD ON THE LX VERSION OF THE ODYSSEY.  DESPITE ASSURANCES FROM THE DEALER THAT THESE TIRES ARE SAFE, THE TIRE NEVERTHELESS EXPLODED.  TIRE WAS WELL MAINTAINED, PROPERLY INFLATED AND ROUTINELY ROTATED.  DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE I DID.  TRADE UP FOR THE MICHELIN TIRES ON THE EX MODEL.  THE FIRESTONE TIRES ARE NOT SAFE.  DESPITE WHAT THE MANUFACTURER SAYS, THEY ARE NOT SAFE.  FIRESTONE GAVE ME THE RUN AROUND AND ONLY WANTED TO CREDIT ME WITH A FEW DOLLARS OFF ANOTHER FIRESTONE TIRE (HOW CONVENIENT!), DESPITE HAVING 32000 MILES LEFT ON A 70,000 MILE TIRE.  IF YOU VALUE YOUR FAMILY'S LIVES, AVOID FIRESTONE!  *JB",
