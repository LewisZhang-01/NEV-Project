        "summary": "THIS TRUCK WAS ALWAYS SERVICED AT THE DEALER WHERE IT WAS PURCHASED. ANY SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE WAS DONE INCLUDING THE TRANSMISSION. ON THE 60,000 SERVICE THE SERVICE MANAGER SUGGESTED A FLUSH TYPE OF TRANSMISSION SERVICE & I SAID TO PROCEED. THE VERY NEXT DAY THE VEHICLE WAS PICKED UP & IMMEDIATELY SHOWED SYMPTOMS OF SHIFTING AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS THAN IT HAD BEFORE THE SERVICE. AFTER SOME CALLS TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THE VEHICLE WAS BROUGHT BACK SO THEY COULD DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. NO DEFINITIVE ANSWER COULD BE GIVEN BUT THE SERVICE MANAGER STATED, THEY, THE DEALERSHIP, WOULD ACCEPT NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROBLEM. I GUESS THEY NEVER HEARD OF CAUSE & EFFECT. NEEDLESS TO SAY I REMOVED THE VEHICLE FROM THEIR POSSESSION IMMEDIATELY. A THIRD PARTY REPAIR FACILITY HAD DETERMINED THE TRANSMISSION HAD SELF DESTRUCTED TO THE POINT OF MAJOR DAMAGE. SUBSEQUENTLY I SPOKE WITH OTHER SHOPS ONLY TO FIND THE METHOD OF FLUSHING WAS A BAD IDEA MOST LIKELY DID CAUSE THE FAILURE.     SO MUCH FOR AN AUTHORIZED DEALER & MANUFACTURER STANDING BEHIND THEIR WORK.    THIS COST ME TO THE TUNE OF $2,000.",
