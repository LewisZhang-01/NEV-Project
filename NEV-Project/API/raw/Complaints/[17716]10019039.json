THE CORRECTION WILL COST IN EXCESS OF $500.00. THIS IS AN OUTRAGEOUS CONDITION AND REPAIR TO REQUIRE THE OWNER TO COVER, WHEN IT IS OBVIOUS IT WAS A DEFECT WHEN MANUFACTURED. PLEASE HELP TO CORRECT MANUFACTURER OVER SIGHTS LIKE THIS WHEN SELLING A LONG-TERM ITEM LIKE A CAR OR TRUCK. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY VEHICLE OTHERWISE, AND WOULD HATE TO HELP BLEMISH THE REPUTATION OF HONDA AND IT'S PRODUCTS. BUT THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AS A FAILURE DUE TO NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR. *JB",
