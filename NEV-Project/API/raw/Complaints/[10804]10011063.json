        "summary": "I OWN A 95 FORD TAURUS WITH A SPEEDOMETER THAT BOUNCES WILDLY ABOVE 50 MPH. I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THIS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM. I CAME ACROSS A FORD TSB 99-7-9 THAT HAS REPLACEMENT PART, WHEN I CALLED I WAS TOLD THE PART WOULD COST OVER $500.00. I CONTACTED FORD CUSTOMER RELATIONS AND WAS TOLD THE VEHICLE WAS TOO OLD AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT REPAIR THIS. MY VEHICLE HAS 59,000 MILES ON IT AND IT IS IN SAME CONDITION AS WHEN I BOUGHT IT NEW. I FEEL THAT THIS CONSTITUTES SAFETY HAZARD NOT KNOWING WHAT SPEED THE VEHICLE IS TRAVELING. I THINK THAT IF YOU INVESTIGATE THIS, YOU WILL FIND THAT IT IS A VERY COMMON COMPLAINT. THAT IS WHY I AM MAKING RECORD OF THIS. *JB",
