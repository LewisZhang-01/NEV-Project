ALSO, AFTER REPLACEMENT OF TENSIONER, OIL CHANGE HAD BEEN DONE AT SAME TIME.  10 MILES AFTER LEAVING DEALERSHIP, GASKET FELL OFF AND LOST ALL OIL PRESSURE WHILE ENGINE WAS ON.  I ASKED DEALERSHIP (COURTESY FORD, POUSLBO WA) TO CHECK FOR DAMAGE, THEY SAID \"NO, IT'S FINE, DON'T WORRY.\"  END RESULT, DUE TO ENGINE DAMAGE FROM RECALLED TENSIONER+ TIMING CHAIN, FORD AGREED TO TERMINATE LEASE EARLY. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A FORD AGAIN.  TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I CONTACTED THE NATIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE HOTLINE MANY TIMES ATTEMPTING TO RESOLVE THESE MATTERS, NEVER GOT A CALL BACK AS PROMISED.  DEALERSHIP NEVER FOLLOWED UP ON MY COMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS.",
