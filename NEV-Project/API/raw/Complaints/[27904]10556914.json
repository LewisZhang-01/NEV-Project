AFTER LETTING OFF ACCELERATOR AND NOW GOING STRAIGHT, FOUND CAR WAS STILL ACCELERATING AT FULL THROTTLE.  BEGAN HEAVILY STEPPING ON BRAKE WITH CONTINUED UNINTENDED ACCELERATION CONTINUING.  SHIFTED FROM DRIVE TO NEUTRAL AND RPM METER SHOWED ENGINE REVVING TOWARD 7000 RPM AND DECIDED TO GO BACK TO DRIVE GEAR TO AVOID CAUSING ENGINE DAMAGE WHILE STILL HEAVILY STEPPING ON BRAKE.  UNINTENDED ACCELERATION CONTINUED IN DRIVE GEAR AND AFTER SEVERAL MORE SECONDS, I TURNED THE IGNITION OFF WHILE IN DRIVE GEAR.  ENGINE SUCCESSFULLY SHUT OFF AND I CONTINUED TO KEEP FOOT ON BRAKE AND STEERING THE CAR TO A PARKING LOT.  AFTER CAR CAME TO A STOP IN PARKING LOT, PUT THE GEAR BACK TO PARK MODE AND PROCEEDED TO START THE CAR IGNITION (I HAVE NOT TOUCHED THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL AT ALL SINCE REALIZING THE UNINTENDED ACCELERATION HAD OCCURRED).  CAR STARTED AS NORMAL WITH NORMAL IDLE SPEED IN PARK.  DROVE THE CAR TO DEALER AND HAD DEALER CHECK FOR CODES AND TAKE IT FOR A TEST DRIVE.  NOTHING ABNORMAL WAS FOUND DURING CODE READING AND TEST DRIVE.  DEALER SAID THAT DRIVER SIDE RUG COULD HAVE CAUSED ACCELERATOR TO STICK BUT THIS IS NOT LIKELY CAUSE (IN MY OPINION) BECAUSE THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL SHOULD THEN HAVE STILL BEEN STUCK WHEN I RE-STARTED THE CAR IN THE PARKING LOT.  *TR",
