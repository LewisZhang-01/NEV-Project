THE TRANSMISSION HESITATES TO SHIFT GEARS WHEN TRAVELING FORWARD.  ALTHOUGH THE GEAR SHIFT LEVEL CAN BE PLACED INTO REVERSE, THE VEHICLE WILL NOT MOVE IN REVERSE.  LINDSAY CHEVROLET (DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE 3 YEARS, 2-1/2 MONTHS AGO) CONDUCTED A PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSIS THAT INVOLVED NO COMPUTER CHECK, BUT BASED ON THE EVIDENT NOISE AND PERFORMANCE OF THE TRANSMISSION RECOMMENDED REPLACEMENT OF THE TRANSMISSION.
