AT 42,000 MILES MY ABS BRAKES WENT OFF WHILE CROSSING AN INTERSECTION IN THE RAIN AND WOULD NOT GO OFF.  I WAS FORCED TO REMOVE THE FUSE FOR THE ABS TO SHUTOFF THE PUMP AND THEREFORE NO LONGER HAVE SAFETY BENEFIT OF ANTI-LOCK BRAKES. I HAVE SIX OTHER FRIENDS WHO HAVE HAD THE EXACT SAME PROBLEMS UNDER SIMILAR WEATHER CONDITIONS.  IF THIS IS AS COMMON A PROBLEM AS IT APPEARS TO BE, WHY HASN'T THE NHTSA GONE AFTER CHEVROLET TO FIX THIS POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING PROBLEM.  I'M SURE A SURVEY OF CHEVROLET OWNERS WOULD PROVIDE A WEALTH OF INFORMATION AS TO THE EXTENT OF THIS PROBLEM.  BC     *NLM",
