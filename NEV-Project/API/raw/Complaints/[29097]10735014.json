        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING MY VEHICLE AND THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AS DID THE WRENCH ICON SIGNIFYING A NEED OF IMMEDIATE REPAIR. THE CAR KEPT DRIVING, BUT I HAD TO SLOW DOWN FOR TRAFFIC. WHEN I TRIED TO ACCELERATE AGAIN, MY CAR HAD LITTLE POWER. I PRESSED THE GAS PEDAL FURTHER AND THE CAR JERKED FORWARD, THEN SLOWED ITSELF DOWN IMMEDIATELY AND BUCKED ON ME A FEW TIMES. I WAS IN TRAFFIC AND IT CAUSED ME TO ALMOST GET REAR ENDED TWICE AS IT WOULD ABRUPTLY STOP. THE ENGINE RAN, I COULD DRIVE, BUT IT WOULDN'T LET ME GO VERY FAST AND KEPT SWITCHING GEARS ON ME. I TOOK IT TO THE SHOP, AND THEY SAID IT WAS A LOGIC ISSUE BUT COULD BE A FURTHER TRANSMISSION ISSUE AND I SHOULD DRIVE IT UNTIL SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS. THEY ALSO PROMISED ME THAT THE LOGIC WAS FIXED AND NOTHING LIKE THAT WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN. THIS SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENED A WEEK LATER EXACTLY AS IT HAD HAPPENED BEFORE. AGAIN, I ALMOST GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF HOW ABRUPTLY THE CAR STOPPED AND SPED UP. THE INTERNET IS FULL OF STORIES JUST LIKE THIS ONE.",
