THE FRONT END WOBBLES AND SHAKES, ESPECIALLY WHEN ACCELERATING AND THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTS VERY HARSHLY, WITH A SLAM.  THE TRANSMISSION HAS AN INTERNAL LEAK SO THAT WE HAVE TO CHECK THE FLUID CONSTANTLY, BUT NO FLUID IS DRAINING ONTO THE STREET.    IT WILL COST US $2,500 TO REPAIR.  WHEN WE BOUGHT THE CAR 2 YEARS AGO IT HAD JUST HAD THE TRANSAXLE REPLACED.",
