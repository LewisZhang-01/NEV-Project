WHILE THERE IS A TECHNICAL SERVICES BULLETIN RELATED TO THIS PROBLEM STATING THAT SATURNS BUILT BETWEEN 1994 AND 1996 MAY DEVELOP CRACKS AND OFFERING COMPENSATION IF HIS OCCURS WITHIN 6 YEARS OR 100,000 MILES, MY CAR WAS OVER THE 6 YEARS THAT THE WARRANTY COVERED.  IN RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM, I HAVE FOUND THAT THIS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON EXPERIENCE FOR SATURN OWNERS AND FEEL THAT A RECALL OF THE CYLINDER HEADS IS NECESSARY AND/OR THAT SATURN NEEDS TO COMPENSATE OWNERS BEYOND THE 6 YEAR LIMIT.   *JB",
