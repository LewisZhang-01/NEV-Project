THIS PART HOLDS THE SEAT BELT TIGHT WHEN PULLED ON. THIS IS NOT THE LATCH. THE 1994 DODGE RAM HAD A RECALL ON THIS. I RECEIVED THIS INFORMATION ON THE 1994'S FROM AN EMPLOYEE AT MY DEALERSHIP. THE DEALER CLAIMS I HAVE TO PURCHASE ALL NEW SEAT BELTS TO FIX THE PROBLEM, I ONLY NEED LOCKING MECHANISMS. PLEASE ADVISE I CAN NOT PUT MY CHILDS SEAT IN THE BACK BECAUSE THE SEAT BELT WILL NOT HOLD THERE SEATS TIGHT.  THANK YOU",
