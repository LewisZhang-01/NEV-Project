I KNEW I HAD NOT LEFT ANYTHING ON TO RUN IT DOWN. AFTER GETTING THE BATTERY CHARGED AND MY CAR STARTED I HEADED OFF TO WORK ABOUT 5 MINUTES INTO MY DRIVE MY DOOR LOCKS STARTED GOING CRAZY UNLOCKING THEM SELVES AND MAKING A CLICKING NOISE THIS CONTINUED FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES WHEN I GOT TO WORK I LOCKED THE CAR UP AND WENT TO WORK GOT OFF WORK TO FIND OUT THE BATTERY AGAIN WAS DEAD. AND THIS TIME MY DOORS WERE UNLOCKED. I HAD THIS PROBLEM ON AND OFF FOR THE NEXT WEEK UNTIL I HAD TO BUY A NEW BATTERY. THE NEW BATTERY SEEMED TO FIX THE ISSUE SO I THOUGHT.
