THIS WEEK THE CLUTCH PEDAL BEGAN TO SQUEAK CONSTANTLY WHILE DRIVING AS IF WERE LOOSE.  I HAVE TO BRACE THE CLUTCH PEDAL WITH MY LEFT FOOT IN ORDER TO STOP THE NOISE WHICH IS CONSTANT AT MOST SPEEDS AND ESPECIALLY OVER BUMPS.  A CLOSER LOOK REVEALED THAT IT APPEARS THE WELDS ON THE CLUTCH PEDAL ARE BEGINNING TO FAIL WHERE IT ATTACHES TO THE VEHICLE'S FIREWALL. THIS WOULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO THE PEDAL BREAKING OFF DURING DRIVING AND THE POTENTIAL OF A CRASH.  *TR",
