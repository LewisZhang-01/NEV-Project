ERROR MESSAGES THAT ARISE INCLUDE \" BATTERY SAVER ON' AND \"AUDIO OFF\" INDICATORS AND AFTER JUMPSTARTING THE VEHICLE WILL START WITH THE KEY IN THE \"ON\" POSITION AND IN SOME CASES SUCH AS MINE, THE VEHICLE WILL NOT SHIFT OUT OF 5TH GEAR UNTIL THE IGNITION IS CYCLED OFF AND THEN ON AGAIN. OVER THE COURSE OF THE PREVIOUS 2.5 MONTHS I HAVE HAD MY VEHICLE IN THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE DEPARTMENT 6 TIMES TOTALING OVER 30+ DAYS. THIS VEHICLE HAS LEFT ME STRANDED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS REQUIRING ME TO FIND SOMEONE TO JUMPSTART IT EACH TIME. THERE ARE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS YEAR MODEL FOR THE EXACT SAME ISSUE WITH NO RESOLUTION FROM FORD. I HAVE UTILIZED EVERY POSSIBLE AVENUE TO GET THIS ISSUE RESOLVED AND AM HOPING THAT BY FILING THIS COMPLAINT I CAN BRING GREATER ATTENTION TO AN ISSUE THAT IS AFFECTING A GROWING PORTION OF F-150 OWNERS.  *TR",
