I HAD TO DISCONNECT POWER TO THE ABS MODULE TO STOP THE BATTERY FROM DRAINING.  THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THE ABS MODULE IS DEFECTIVE AND THAT IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL AND YEAR.  HE ALSO ADVISED ME THAT IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE ~$1000 TO REPLACE.  I CHECKED THE INTERNED AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.  I THINK CHEVROLET SHOULD BE FORCED TO REPLACE THESE MODULES FREE OF CHARGE.",
