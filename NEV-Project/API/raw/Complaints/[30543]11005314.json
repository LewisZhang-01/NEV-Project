        "summary": "THE VTC ACTUATOR ON MY HONDA ACCORD HAS BEEN MAKING A RATTLING SOUND DURING AN ENGINE COLD STARTUP FOR OVER A YEAR NOW. AFTER CALLING THE CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE THEY STATED THAT IT WAS NOT UNDER A RECALL AND THAT THIS PROBLEM WOULD NOT CAUSE ANY DAMAGE OR RELIABILITY ISSUES. HOWEVER, THE SOUND HAS BEEN GETTING WORSE AND THE OTHER DAY, WHILE DRIVING, MY WIFE LOST ALL POWER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD; THIS IS AN EXTREMELY UNSAFE SITUATION. AFTER TAKING IT TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THE DEALERSHIP THEY SAID THE PROBLEM IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VTC ACTUATOR AND WE WILL NEED TO REPLACE THIS ACTUATOR WITH A REDESIGNED ACTUATOR AT A COST OF $1600(INCLUDING SUGGESTED PART CHANGES WHILE THE WORK IS BEING DONE).  THE COST IS NOT IMPORTANT TO ME, IT IS THE SAFETY ASPECT OF THE SITUATION THAT'S TROUBLESOME.  IF A REDESIGNED ACTUATOR EXISTS SHOULDN'T CUSTOMERS AT LEAST BE AWARE OF THIS AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF NOT CHANGING THIS PART?",
