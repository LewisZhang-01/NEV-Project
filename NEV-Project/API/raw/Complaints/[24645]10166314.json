        "summary": "MY WIFE WAS TRAVELING ALONG ON THE INTERSTATE WHEN THE TREAD SEPARATED FROM THE LEFT FRONT TIRE.  THE TREAD SEPARATION DESTROYED THE LEFT FRONT QUARTER PANEL AND DRIVER SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR. THE VEHICLE WAS NO LONGER DRIVABLE AND HAD TO BE TOWED.  WE CONTACTED OUR INSURANCE COMPANY TO START A CLAIM FOR THE DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE TIRE.  THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A BODY SHOP FOR REPAIR.  THE VEHICLE IS BEING REPAIRED AND SHOULD BE READY SOON.  I WENT TO THE TIRE STORE WHERE THE TIRES WERE PURCHASED 1.5 YEARS AGO.  THE MANAGER MENTIONED THAT IT WAS A DEFECTIVE ISSUE AND CONTACT BRIDGESTONE.  I CALLED BRIDGESTONE AND THEY MAILED ME A CLAIMS FORM.  BRIDGESTONE IS REQUESTING ME TO SHIP THE TIRE TO THEIR FACILITY FOR INSPECTION.  I FEEL THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO SHIP THE TIRE TO THEM AND THEY STILL MAY NOT HONOR THE CLAIM.  I HAVE THE DEFECTIVE TIRE AND PICTURES OF THE DAMAGE THAT WAS DONE TO THE VEHICLE.  WE HAVE BEEN WITHOUT THE USE OF THE VEHICLE SINCE AUGUST 11, 2006.  THE TIRES ON THE VEHICLE ARE BRIDGESTONE B420 IN SIZE P205 70R14.  *JB",
