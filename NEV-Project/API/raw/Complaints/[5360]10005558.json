        "summary": "I HAVE A CONCERN OVER THE DEFECT OF THE HEAD GASKET OF OUR 1996 FORD WINDSTAR.   THIS VEHICLE IS OUR FAMILY VEHICLE - VERY NECCESSARY FOR A FAMILY OF YOUNG CHILDREN - FAMILY OF 7.  SO FAR, WE HAVE REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION, REPLACED THE SPEEDOMETER, AND MOST RECENTLY HAVE BEEN TOLD TO REPLACE THE HEAD GASKET.  I UNDERSTAND THAT THE HEAD GASKET REPAIR/ REPLACEMENT IS A RATHER EXPENSIVE REPAIR.  I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT FORD HAS OFFERED TO SOME, TO MAKE GOOD ON THIS DEFECT IN WORKMANSHIP.  I HAVE BEEN ADVISED TO TURN THIS IN TO THE STATE'S ATTORNEY HERE IN NORTH DAKOTA, AND TO THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU.  I NEED THIS VEHICLE FIXED.  I DON'T CARE FOR THE FORD DEALERSHIP IN JAMESTOWN, ND - SINCE THE LAST REPAIR LEFT ME WITHOUT A VEHICLE FOR A MONTH.       I WOULD LIKE THIS DEFECT TAKEN CARE OF.  I THINK FORD HAS MADE A SAFE VAN FOR MY FAMILY, BUT I AM VERY DISSAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE PARTS UNDER THE HOOD - WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT FORD WOULD HAVE SUCH POOR WORKMANSHIP THAT I WOULD HAVE THIS MUCH TROUBLE WITH THIS 1996 VEHICLE.     PLEASE ADVISE ME ON HOW TO OBTAIN THE PAPERWORK THAT WILL GET THIS DEFECT ON THE HEAD GASKET PROPERLY PAID FOR AND TAKEN CARE OF BY FORD.",
