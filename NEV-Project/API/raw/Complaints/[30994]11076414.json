THERE IS NO WAY THAT THE COLLISION DAMAGE COULD HAVE CAUSED A STEEL BALL JOINT TO SNAP BEFORE THE WEAKER ALUMINUM PARTS GAVE WAY.  THE SEAT OF THE BALL JOINT IS BRIGHT AND SHINY AND COMPLETELY UNDAMAGED.  LOOKING AT ALL THE OTHER REPORTS OF SIMILAR FAILURES EXAMPLE - HTTPS://TESLAMOTORSCLUB.COM/TMC/THREADS/MS-SUSPENSION-BALL-JOINT-FAILURE.109847/    IT IS CERTAIN THAT THERE IS A BAD BATCH OF BALL JOINTS THAT FRACTURE WITHOUT WARNING.  TESLA IS COVERING UP THIS ISSUE.  THIS AMOUNTS TO CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE.  PLEASE TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION BEFORE MORE LIVES ARE LOST.    THANK YOU.  CONCERNED CITIZEN.",
