WHEN I STARTED TURNING THERE WAS A BUNCH OF CARS BEHIND ME AND THE BACK OF THE SEAT MADE A LOUD POPPING NOISE AND I HIT MY HEAD ON THE WINDOW BECAUSE THE BACK RIGHT OF IT GAVE OUT. I PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND GOT MY SELF TOGETHER. THIS HAPPENED TO ANOTHER COWORKER WITH ANOTHER NISSAN  MURANO BUT SHE HAD LESS PROBLEMS SINCE SHE'S A TALL WOMAN AND WHEN THE SEAT BROKE IT DIDN'T GO ALL THE WAY DOWN. LOOKING AT THE SEAT THE BACK RIGHT OF IT HAS A BIG METAL BAR PIECE THAT SNAPPED. IT NO LONGER GOES ALL THE WAY UP MAKING IT A HAZARD TO DRIVE WITHOUT GETTING IT FIXED. * DSY",
