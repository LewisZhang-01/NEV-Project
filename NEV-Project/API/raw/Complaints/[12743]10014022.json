I HAVE SINCE FOUND OUT THAT WAL-MART, THE COMPANY I WORK FOR, HAS HAD ENGINE PROBLEMS ON BETWEEN 30 AND 50 OF THEIR '98-'99 MALIBU'S, GRAND AM'S AND GRAND PRIX'S.  I AM STILL TRYING TO GET GM TO PAY FOR THE NEW ENGINE I HAD TO GET BECAUSE THIS IS MY ONLY CAR.  I PAID $2000.00 FOR A USED ENGINE TO BE INSTALLED AND WHO'S TO SAY THAT THE SAME THING WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN SINCE IT'S THE SAME TYPE 3.1 ENGINE.*JB",
