DEALERSHIP HAS REPLACED PASSENGER SEAT CUSHION TWICE AND IT STILL DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY.  DEALERSHIP IS NOT ABLE TO FIX THE PROBLEM. I FEAR AN ACCIDENT OCCURRING WITHOUT PROPER RELEASE OF AIR BAG RESULTING IN POSSIBLE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.  I HAVE SEEN THAT THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS OF THIS PROBLEM.  KIA NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND RECALL ALL 2008 KIA RIO FOR THIS IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. *TR",
