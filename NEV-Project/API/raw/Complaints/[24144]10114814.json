NOW YOU MUST AUTOMATICALLY UNLOCK THE DOOR THEN MANUALLY RELEASE THE LOCK.  NOW AT 62000 THE LEFT REAR PASSENGER LOCK IS MAKING A LOUD BUZZING NOISE BUT STILL WILL UNLOCK.  THIS COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS IN A CRASH BECAUSE YOU CANNOT UNLOCK THE RIGHT PASSENGER DOOR WITH OUT KNOWING TO RELEASE THE LOCKS AUTOMATICALLY AND THEN MANUALLY UNLOCKING THE DOORS.   A FAMILY MEMBER WHO ALSO OWNS A CHRYSLER PRODUCT OF THE SAME YEAR  HAS HAD ISSUES WITH THE DOORLOCKS  AND TOOK IT TO THE DEALER (HIS WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY) AND WAS TOLD THAT SEVERAL MODELS OF THAT YEAR HAVE DEFECTED LOCKS.  THEY REPLACED ALL HIS LOCKS AFTER THE SECOND LOCK WENT OUT.",
