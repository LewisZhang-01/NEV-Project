AT ONE POINT JERKED OUT OF MY HAND. IT BECAME ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTINUE. I PULLED INTO A CONVIENCE STORE, BOUGHT POWER STEERING FLUID AND STARTED THE VEHICLE. THE STEERING SEEMED NORMAL. THE CAR WAS NOT LOW ON FLUIDS, I DIDN'T TRAVEL FAR BEFORE IT HAPPENED AGAIN. BY THE TIME I MADE IT HOME MY RIBS WERE HURTING FROM TRYING TO MANAUVER THE CAR HOME. THIS MALFUNCTION IS THE EPS SYSTEM AND RECALLS OF THE 2008 BEGAN IN 2014. MY VIN# WASN'T INCLUDED ON THE LIST. HOWEVER, MY CAR HAS THE SAME PROBLEM. AT ONE POINT MY STEERING WHEEL JERKED SO HARD IT YANKED STEERING WHEEL AWAY FROM MY GRIP AND I CAME CLOSE TO HITTING ANOTHER VEHICLE. PRIOR TO THE ABOVE OCCASION, I WOULD BE STOPPED AT A SIGNAL  LIGHT AND THE STEERING WHEEL GRINDED JERKED BACK AND FOURTH AND UNFETTERED.",
