        "summary": "EVER SINCE 2010, I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH A SERIOUS GM PASSLOCK ANTI-THEFT SYSTEM ISSUE. IT BEGAN WITH MY VEHICLE NOT STARTING ONE DAY. IT HAD POWER; ALL OF THE DASH LIGHTS WORKED, RADIO, ETC..., BUT IT WOULD NOT START. AT FIRST, I HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO, BUT I WOULD ALWAYS SOMEHOW GET IT TO START AFTER A LOT OF PUNCHING OF THE DASHBOARD AND SHIFTING MY GEARS RAPIDLY OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE PROBLEM SLOWLY STARTED OCCURRING MORE FREQUENTLY AND I BEGAN TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON IT AND FIGURED OUT THAT IT WAS INDEED AN PASSLOCK SYSTEM MALFUNCTION AFTER CONFIRMING THAT MY SECURITY LIGHT WOULD BLINK WHEN THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT START. I COULD GET IT TO START AFTER WAITING 10 MINUTES WITH THE KEY IN THE ON POSITION, WHEN THE SECURITY LIGHT WOULD STOP BLINKING AFTER THAT 10 MINS, I WOULD TURN IT BACK TO THE OFF POSITION AND THEN BACK TO THE ON POSITION AND IT WOULD START UP, RESETTING THE PASSLOCK SYSTEM. EVENTUALLY, IN 2012, THE PROBLEM WAS OCCURRING USUALLY EVERY 3RD ATTEMPT AT STARTING UP, AND THE PASSLOCK SYSTEM RESET TRICK WOULD NOT WORK 9/10 TIMES, IT WOULD SOMETIMES TAKE HOURS FOR ME TO GET IT TO START. IN NOVEMBER OF 2012, I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND MY CAR SLOWLY STARTING SHUTTING DOWN, ALL WARNING LIGHTS FLASHING, AND ALL THE INTERIOR LIGHTS DIMMED DOWN TO NOTHING, LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER UNHARMED (ALSO ABOUT 2 WEEKS BEFORE THIS, MY DRIVER'S SIDE TURN SIGNAL RELAY SYSTEM COMPLETELY BLEW/FAILED). I FOUND OUT THAT MY ALTERNATOR WAS COMPLETELY DRAINED AND DEAD, SO I REPLACED IT. THIS FIXED THE PROBLEM FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS, AND THEN IT STARTED OCCURRING AGAIN EVERY NOW AND THEN AND HAS BEEN OCCURRING INTERMITTENTLY EVER SINCE; THE PASSLOCK RESET IS CURRENTLY WORKING. CONSIDERING THAT THE ALTERNATOR WAS ONLY A TEMPORARY FIX, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A MALFUNCTION OF THE GM PASSLOCK SYSTEM. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AND HAS CAUSED HARM TO MY LIFE (EG. SCHOOL & JOB EFFECTED)",
