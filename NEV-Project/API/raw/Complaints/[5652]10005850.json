        "summary": "ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS WHEN WE WERE COMING TO A STOP AT A LIGHT ---- AS WE PRESSED ON THE BRAKE PEDAL THE ENGINE REVVED UP TO APPROXIMATELY 2500 RPM. THIS MADE STOPPING THE VEHICLE A LOT MORE DIFFICULT & COULD FEEL THE ANTI-LOCK BREAKS WORKING TO STOP THE CAR. LUCKILY, THERE WAS NEVER A VEHICLE IN FRONT OF US IN EACH OF THE INSTANCES ---- BUT WE'RE NOT SURE IF THIS COULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO A FUTURE ACCIDENT. MY CONFIDENCE WITH THE DEALERSHIPS IS NOT VERY HIGH IN DIAGNOSING THIS PROBLEM IF THEY CAN'T RE-CREATE IT OR IF IT DIDN'T SENT A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CODE. THEY WOULD JUST CHARGE ME FOR THEIR DIAGNOSTIC EFFORTS. NOTE: I ALSO RECENTLY HAS HIGH REVVING PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE WITHIN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, BUT THEY WERE AT START-UP & IT SENT A TROUBLE CODE. AFTER THREE TRIPS TO THE DEALERSHIP WITH A IAC VALVE AND PCM REPLACEMENT BILL --- THEY ALLEVIATED THE PROBLEM. THIS SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING ELSE & MUCH MORE DANGEROUS.    *NLM",
