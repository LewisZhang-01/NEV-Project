(AK) OPPOSING REGULATIONS TO SUBMIT QUARTERLY INFORMATIONAL REPORTS, EARLY WARNING REPORTS (EWR) DOT 2003-4246. MR JOHNSON CLAIMS THAT THE NEW REGULATIONS AR UNFAIR TO SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZE TRAILER COMPANIES, UNDER 26000 LBS, AND SHOULD BE RESCINDED OR RADICALLY CHANGED, OTHERWISE IT COULD PUT HIM AND MANY OF HIS COLLEAGUES OUT OF BUSINESS.

BECAUSE JOHNSON'S COMPANY PRODUCES MORE THAN 500 TRAILERS ANNUALLY IT WAS LUMPED TOGETHER WITH FORD, GMC AND FREUHAUF BOUND BY TREAD ACT. ALSO, ACCORDING TO NHTSA'S OWN ESTIMATES, JOHNSON WILL BE FORCED TO SPENT $225000  WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS TO MEET NHTSA'S REQUIREMENTS. AFTERWARDS, $145000  ANNUALLY TO COMPLY. ALSO, THOSE TRAILER COMPANIES UNDER 26000 LBS ARE RARELY INVOLVED IN SERIOUS ACCIDENTS OR HAVE SERIOUS SAFETY RELATED DEFECTS. *AK  *NLM",
