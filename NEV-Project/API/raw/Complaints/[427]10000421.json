AFTER CLOSING THE DOOR I OBSERVED IN THE OUTSIDE REARVIEW MIRROR THAT IT APPEARED MY GARAGE DOOR WAS NOT FULLU OPENED. I THEN OPENED THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR AND EXITED IT WITHOUT CLOSING IT. WITH MY BACK TO THE VEHICLE I VERIFIED THAT THE GARAGE DOOR WAS FULLY OPENED. BEFORE I COULD TURN AROUND THE VEHICLE HAD PROCEEDED TO BACK OUT OF THE GARAGE WITH THE CAR DOOR OPENED. I WAS NOT ABLE TO RE-ENTER THE VEHICLE WITH THE HOPES OF STOPPING IT AS THE DOOR MADE CONTACT WITH SOME PLASTIC CONTAINERS. THE CONTAINERS DID CREATE A VOID FOR ME AS ONCE THE CONTAINERS GAVE WAY UNDER THE FORCE OF THE DOOR I WAS THEN THROWN CLEAR OF THE OPENED CAR DOOR AND THE GARAGE DOOR DOOR JAM. AFTER I WAS ABLE TO PICK MYSELF UP FROM THE FLOOR I WAS ABLE TO RUN AND STOP THE CAR WHEN IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET DOWN THE DRIVEWAY.",
