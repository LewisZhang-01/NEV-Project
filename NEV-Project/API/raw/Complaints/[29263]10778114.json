        "summary": "MY PARENTS PURCHASED A 2008 MERCURY MARINER THIS LAST SPRING, AND JUST STARTED TO NOTICE THAT THE ELECTRIC POWER STEERING IS CUTTING IN AND OUT. WE TOOK IT TO OUR LOCAL GARAGE WHO DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM (ERROR CODE THAT CAME UP WAS B1342-2F) AND RECOMMENDED WE REPLACE THE STEERING COLUMN. SINCE THAT IS A LARGE EXPENSE ($800) I DECIDED TO DO SOME RESEARCH AND CALLED THE LOCAL FORD DEALER. THEY LOOKED UP OUR VIN AND TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE ELECTRIC POWER STEERING AND THAT THE WORK FOR THE RECALL ON THE POWER STEERING WAS ALREADY DONE. (FORD'S RECALL NUMBER FOR THIS IS 14S05) MY QUESTION IS SINCE WE ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME FAILURE (MEANING THE FIX DIDN'T SEEM TO LAST) IS THERE ANY RECOURSE FOR US TO HAVE FORD FIX THE PROBLEM NOW? ALSO, HOW LONG ARE THESE 'FIXES' SUPPOSED TO LAST? THE DATE THE RECALL WAS PUBLISHED BY NHTSA IS 2014-06-05, AND WE ARE ONLY IN SEPTEMBER OF 2015. I WAS THINKING THAT A RECALL FIX SHOULD LAST LONGER THAN A LITTLE OVER A YEAR. IS NHTSA IN THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING THIS ISSUE?",
