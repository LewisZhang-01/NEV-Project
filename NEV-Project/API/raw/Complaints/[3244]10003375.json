BEFORE THEY EVEN LOOKED AT THEM THE SERVICE PERSON KNEW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS....WARPED ROTORS.  I ASKED IF IT WAS COVERED UNDER WARRENTY AND HE SAID NO.....EXTENDED WARRENTY AND HE SAID NO.  I TOLD HIM THAT I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE 30,000 MILES ON THE CAR, IT'S ONLY 1 1/2 YEARS OLD AND THAT I'VE HAD VEHICLES WHOSE BRAKES LASTED TO 40,000 OR 50,000 MILES.  HE SAID HE'S SEEN THESE BRAKES GO AT 20,000!  ALSO TOLD ME THAT DIAMLER/CHRYSLER KNOWS THEY HAVE A PROBLEM.....HMMMM FUNNY HOW THEY DON'T COVER BRAKES PAST 12 MONTHS/12,000 MILES.  SAID THAT HE'D PUT NEW BRAKES ON THAT WEREN'T FACTORY INSTALLED FOR $400 WHEN I GET TIRED OF THE SHIMMERING.....AND GUARANTEE THEM FOR THE LIFE OF MY VEHICLE.",
