AN EXPERT FROM CALIFORNIA HAD TO BE CALLED IN TO ANALYZE THE PROBLEM, SINCE THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP HAD NEVER SEEN APROBLEM LIKE THIS. THE PROBATIBLE CAUSE OF THIS FAILURE WAS MENTIONED TO ME MY MAKING A PANIC ACTIVATION OF THE BRAKE PEDAL WHICH DEMAGED A BRAKE SWITCH LOCATED ABOVE THE BRAKE PEDAL. THE SWITCH,ITS SUPPORT BRACKET, ALL BRAKE ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS HAD TO BE REPLACED AND WERE SHIPPED TO THE HOME OFFICE.THE REPAIR TOOK THREE WEEKS. MY SUV WAS RETURNED TO ME WITH THE BRAKE SWITCH THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE CAUSED THE COMPLETE BRAKE FAILURE IN THE SAME LOCATION AS IT WAS BEFORE. I INFORMED TOYOTA THAT I CONSIDERED THE SWITCH LOCATION AS A SAFETY HAZARD AS IT IS IN THE SAME LOCATION IN ALL 2006 AND 2007 RAV4'S.THE COMPLETE REPORT AND CORROSPONDENCE, INCLUDING PICTURES , IS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST.AS FOR MY CREDENTIALS; I AM A GRADUATE MECHANICAL ENGINEER,HAVING SERVED ON AN ACCIDENT/INCEDENT REVIEW BOARD AND WAS A MEMBER OF THE APOLLO, CHALLANGER AND COLUMBIA INVESTIGATING TEAMS.  *NM",
