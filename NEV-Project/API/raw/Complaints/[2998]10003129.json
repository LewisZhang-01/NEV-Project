THIS IS DANGEROUS BEYOND BELIEF, ESPECIALLY IF THEY MALFUNCTION WHILE ON A HIGHWAY, WHICH HAS HAPPENED TO MANY PEOPLE (SEE CARREVIEW.COM).    MY 2002 CAR HAS BEEN TOWED TWICE IN THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF.  I SPENT $24,500 FOR THIS CAR, IT IS BRAND NEW, AND I CANNOT DRIVE IT FOR FEAR OF CAUSING AN ACCIDENT.  VW MUST BE FORCED TO  RECALL THIS CAR BEFORE SOMEONE IS INJURED.  THEY'LL BE NO STOPPING THE CLASS-ACTION LAW SUITS THEN!",
