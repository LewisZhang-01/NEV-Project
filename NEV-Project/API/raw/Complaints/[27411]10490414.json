        "summary": "I WOULD LIKE TO LODGE A FORMAL COMPLAINT IN REGARDS TO THE HEAD LIGHTS ON THE HONDA CR-V. THE 2012 AND 2013 MODELS BOTH SUFFER FROM VERY DIM HEADLIGHTS. WHILE THE BRIGHTNESS MAY BE ENOUGH TO PASS NTSB REGULATIONS; IN PRACTICE, THEY ARE MUCH MORE DIM THAN MOST IF NOT ALL MODERN VEHICLES. I AM A MEMBER ON MULTIPLE FORUMS SITES AND THERE ARE A GREAT DEAL OF CR-V OWNERS THAT FEEL THE HEADLIGHTS IN THE CR-V  WHILE ADEQUATE; COULD BE MUCH BETTER AND ADD TO SAFETY. MANY OWNERS HAVE TAKEN TO REPLACING ENTIRE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLIES IN FAVOR OF HID BALLASTS WHILE OTHERS HAVE TESTED VARIOUS BRANDS OF AFTER-MARKET BULBS. ON DARK ROADWAYS; THERE IS NOT ENOUGH LIGHT PRODUCED BY EITHER THE LOW OR HIGH BEAM TO FULLY ILLUMINATE THE PATH IN FRONT OF THE CAR AND THE CORNER LIGHTING IS POOR AT BEST. I FEEL THAT HONDA SHOULD TAKE OWNERSHIP AND OFFER IT'S CUSTOMERS A BETTER LIGHTING OPTION FROM THE FACTORY.  *TR",
