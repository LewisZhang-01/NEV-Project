MECHANIC STATES THE BRAKES ARE FINE AND FOUND A FRONT CROSSMEMBER OF THE SUBFRAME COMPLETELY RUSTED APART NEXT TO THE SWAY BAR. THE 2007 MODEL HAS AN EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT WAS GIVEN TO EXTEND IT 10 YEARS WITH UNLIMITED MILEAGE FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE CROSSMEMBER, BUT THEY HAVE YET TO DO THIS WITH THE 2009 MODEL. OBVIOUSLY, THE ISSUE HAS CONTINUED WITH SUBSEQUENT MODEL YEARS AND IS ABSOLUTELY UNREASONABLE TO THINK A VEHICLE THAT IS 7 YEARS OLD WITH NO OTHER RUST, SHOULD HAVE SUCH A SERIOUS ISSUE.",
