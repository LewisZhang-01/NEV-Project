        "summary": "I BOUGHT MY KIA RIO 2003 FEBRUARY 8, 2003. THE PROBLEMS STARTED ON MAY 15, 2003 MY CAR CUT OFF WHILE DRIVING TO WORK, AS I TRIED TO START THE CAR BACK UP IT TOOK 3 TO 4 TIMES TO GET IT TO FINALLY START. I TOOK IT IN 3 TIMES TO BE SERVICED AND THEY EITHER TELL ME THAT THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT, OR THEY TELL ME TO USE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF GAS IN MY CAR AND A DIFFERENT GRADE. THE MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT SAID THAT KIA INC. SAYS IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MIDWEST FUEL, YET WHEN I WENT TO THE SERVICE DESK TWO OTHER PEOPLE WERE BEING SERVICED FOR THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM. THE MAINTENANCE CREW ADMITTED AFTER THE SECOND TIME THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS CUTTING OFF, AND THAT IT IS BECOMING A COMMON PROBLEM FOR THE 2003 KIA RIO. ALL THE TIMES I'VE BEEN SERVICED AT KIA NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE, THEY TELL ME THEY DROVE MY CAR \"X\" AMOUNT OF MILES YET THEY FIND NO PROBLEM WITH IT, ALTHOUGH WHEN I DRIVE IT EITHER IT CUTS OFF WHILE DRIVING, HAS A HARD START, OR THE BRAKES SQUEAKS LOUDLY WHEN I COME TO A STOP. I TOLD THEM ABOUT THE BRAKES AND THEY TOLD ME ITS NORMAL FOR A NEW CAR, YET IT SEEMS TO GET LOUDER AND LOUDER. MY CAR WAS HARD AT TRYING TO START TODAY, AND IT CUT OFF AGAIN AT THE TOLLWAY BOOTH, I WILL BE TAKING IT BACK TO MATTESON KIA AUTO MART TOMORROW JUNE 16, 2003 AND THIS WILL BE THE FOURTH TIME FOR THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED.   *NLM",
