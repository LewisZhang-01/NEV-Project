        "summary": "WATER WAS FOUND IN THE OIL DURING A ROUTINE OIL CHANGE IN AUG 2002.  THE VIN WAS TRACED BACK TO BE PART OF THE TIMING CHAIN COVER RECALL.  WHEN THE VEHCILE WAS BROUGHT TO THE DEALER, THE DEALER CLAIMED NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE RECALL.  WHEN FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS CONTACTED, THEY DID ACKNOWLEGE THE RECALL, AND THAT THE VEHICLE WAS PART OF THE RECALL.  WE NEVER RECEIVED THE LETTER, AND WE WERE INFORMED THAT THE RECALL HAD EXPIRED AND THE REPAIR WOULD NOT BE COVERED.  WE MADE THE DECISION TO PAY $800 FOR THE RECALL REPAIR (WHICH THE DEALER HAPPENED TO HAVE A KIT IN STOCK).  SIX MONTHS LATER, THE ENGINE HAS APPARENTLY BLOWN ANOTHER GASEKET (SOUNDS LIKE THE MANIFOLD GASKET FROM OTHERS EXPERIENCE) AND FILLED THE #1 CYLINDER WITH WATER.  OTHER INTERNAL DAMAGE IS UNKNOWN, THE ENGINE WILL BE REPLACED RATHER THAN REPAIRED AGAIN.",
