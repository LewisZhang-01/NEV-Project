MY CONCERN IS MY TWO CHILDREN WHO SIT IN THE MIDDLE BENCH WHICH HAVE THESE GEN3 SEATBELTS.  I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT CHRYSLER OR WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PRODUCT WOULD EVEN TAKE A CHANCE WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES WHEN IT IS SUCH A SIMPLE FIX.  I GUESS THEY WOULD RATHER MILLION DOLLAR LAWSUITS.  THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES.",
