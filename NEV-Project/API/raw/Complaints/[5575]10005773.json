THE STATED VEHICLE WAS REQUESTED FOR RECALL FOR ENGINE MALFUNCTION LAST YEAR AND I HAD VEHICLE DELIVERED BACK TO BOURNE TOYOTA OF3069 WASHINGTON RD AUGUSTA, GA 30907 (706-868-5454) FOR TECHNICAL SERVICE UNDER RECALL.    ONE DAY AFTER RECALL WORK WAS DONE STATED VEHICLE HAD TO BE RETURNED NOW IM FACED WITH AN ENGINE REPLACMENT DUE TO ENGINE SLUDGE BUILD UP. AN PROBLEM THAT HAS NOT ONLY BEEN  PROBLEMATIC IN THE CAMRY LINE BUT WITH THE SIENNA, SOLARA, AVALON, & LEXUS MODELS AS WELL.    HOWEVER BOURNE TOYOTA SAYS THAT ENGINE SLUDGE BUILD-UP IS MY PROBLEM DUE TO ME NOT GETTING THE OIL CHANGED ENOUGH. THE OIL WAS CHANGE ON PERIODIC INTERVALS SINCE RECALL WORK WAS DONE AND THIS IS JUST AN ATTEMPT BY BOURNE TOYOTA TO DENY MY CLAIM AND BILL FOR REPAIRS.    IT WELL DOCUMENTED HOW TOYOTA OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING ENGINE FAILURE DUE TO OIL SLUGE BUILD-UP ARE BEING DENIED WARRANTY CLAIMS, AN ACT THAT I FEEL AS AN LOYAL CUSTOMER IS UTTERLY IRREPONSIBLE ON THE PART OF THE TOYOTA AND THERE DEALERSHIPS AS WELL.    IM AN SCHOOL TEACHER ON AN LIMITED INCOME AND I BOUGHT THIS CAR FROM BOURNE TOYOTA IN GOOD FAITH AND THIS WHOLE SITUATION HAS CAUSED ME FINANCIAL BURDEN IN CAR RENTAL BILLS SO I CAN GET TO WORK.    I ASK FOR ANY ASSISTANCE OR DIRECTION IN INVESTIGATING THIS MATTER FULLY.",
