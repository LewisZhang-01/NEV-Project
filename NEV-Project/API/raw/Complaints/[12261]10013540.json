        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY IN THE FAST LANE, AT 65 MPH, ALL MY DASH LIGHTS CAME ON AND MY SPEEDOMETER STARTED TO DROP FROM 60-50-40 DOWN TO 0.  LUCKILY, IT WAS AROUND 10:30 P.M AND THERE WERE NOT MANY CARS ON THE ROAD AND I WAS ABLE TO GET OVER TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER SAFELY.  I HAD MY VEHICLE TOWED TO MY RELIABLE MECHANIC, WHERE HE IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM AS BEING THE FUEL PUMP (PART # 25060-4S415, WHICH IS ON NATIONAL BACKORDER DUE TO SO MANY PROBLEMS).  THIS COULD MEAN THAT AN XTERRA OWNER COULD WAIT FOR AS LONG AS 3-6 WEEKS TO RECEIVE THE PART.  WITH THIS FAULTY FUEL PUMP, WHAT HAPPENS IS THE SENDING UNIT FAILS, DUE TO CORROSION OF THE WIRES, THE FUEL PUMP SHUTS OFF, WHICH IN TURN, SHUTS THE ENGINE OFF (AT ANY TIME); A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION!  AS OF YET, THIS ITEM HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED.  MY MECHANIC SUGGESTED FOR ME TO KEEP THIS PART FOR REIMBURSEMENT, AS HE HAS REPLACED NEARLY 100 PUMPS ON XTERRAS, HE IS SURE THAT THEY WILL BE RECALLING THIS ITEM SOON.  I WILL BE CALLING THE NISSAN DEALER AS WELL AS WRITING A LETTER TO CORPORATE TO REGISTER MY COMPLAINT ON FILE.  IF YOU HAVE THIS PROBLEM, OR ANY OTHER, PLEASE MAKE SURE TO IDENTIFY IT WITH NISSAN AND THIS WEBSITE SO IT AIDS IN THE RECALL PROCESS.    *NLM",
