THIS HAS HAPPENED THREE TIMES, AND EACH TIME IT HAS BEEN ON EXTENDED INTERSTATE TRIPS OVER 3+ HRS.    NO CEL CODES HAVE BEEN THROWN SO THE DEALER HAS NOT TAKEN THE PROBLEM SERIOUSLY.   I'M NOT EVEN SURE THE DEALERSHIP HAS EVEN DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM WITH JEEP TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  WE ARE UNSURE WHAT TO DO WITH THE VEHICLE AS WE DO NOT TRUST TO TAKE IT FOR ANY TYPE OF TRIP.  IT HAS BEEN TO THE DEALER FOR MANY OTHER ISSUES UNDER WARRANTY AND I WONDER IF THEY ARE ALL RELATED SOMEHOW VIA AN ISSUE WITH THE ENGINE COMPUTER OR ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.",
