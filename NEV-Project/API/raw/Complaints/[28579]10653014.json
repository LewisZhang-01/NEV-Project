        "summary": "WAS DRIVING CAR ABOUT 25MPH AND THE POWER STEERING SHUT OFF. I THOUGHT THE CAR HAD SHUT OFF. THE WHEEL WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO STEER PULLED UP TO STOP SIGH TO CHECK IF CAR WAS STILL RUNNING. IT WAS WHEN I PULLED AWAY THE POWER STEERING WAS WORKING AGAIN. A FEW DAYS LATER MY WIFE WAS DRIVING ABOUT 40MPH AND IT HAPPENED TO HER. SHE WAS GOING AROUND A CORNER, LUCKILY THERE WAS NO ONCOMING TRAFFIC AS SHE HAD TO SWING INTO OTHER LANE AND APPLY BRAKES. VERY VERY SCARED. WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP. WHERE IT IS STILL. THEY CAN SEE VIA THERE COMPUTER THAT IT HAPPENED, BUT CAN'T FIX IT. I TALKED TO CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY SAID BASICALLY SINCE THEY CAN'T FIND THE ISSUE THERE ISN'T ONE. EVEN THOUGH THEY CAN SEE THAT IT HAPPENED. WAS TOLD TO REFER TO MY WHITE AND BLUE BOOK THAT CAME WITH THE CAR. I ASKED WHAT HAPPENS IF I KILL SOMEBODY BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE. AGAIN REFER TO YOUR BOOK.  *TR",
