TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND HAD HIM LOOK AT IT AND SAID STEERING GEAR HAD DROPPED AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.   REPLACED THE STEERING GEAR AND DID AN ALIGNMENT TO THE TURN OF $1400.   WENT TO THE DEALER IN THE FIRST PLACE TO GET SEAT FIXED ON FREE RECALL AND ENDED UP SPENDING OVER $1800 DOLLARS THERE.  NOTICED LOTS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT STEERING ON MYCARSTATS - IS THIS A MFG DEFECT THAT SHOULD BE COVERED?*JB",
