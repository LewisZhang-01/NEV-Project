THIS PROBLEM HAS OCCURED 20-25 TIMES OVER THE LAST 7 MONTHS. THE DEALERSHIP HAS REFLASHED THE CONTROL MODULES, BUT THE PROBLEM PERSIST. THE VEHICLE ISN'T SAFE TO DRIVE BECAUSE OF THE TENDENCY TO STALL AT STOP LIGHTS. WHAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION WAS THE FIRST TIME IT DID IT AND I HAD MY 5 YEARS OLD SON IN THE CAR. THE VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY AT THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY ARE FURTHER INVESTIGATING THE PROBLEM. THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REPLICATE THE ISSUE (STALLING IN REVERSE, AND WHILE IDLING). THE VEHICLE STARTS RIGHT AWAY, BUT OCCASIONALLY POWER ISN'T AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY (2-3 SECONDS DELAY). JEEP WASN'T AWARE OF SIMILAR PROBLEMS WHEN I CALLED... AND THIS MORNING I LEARNED ABOUT OTHER FCA VEHICLES BEEN RECALLED BECAUSE THEY ARE STALLING IN TRAFFIC.",
