SHE HAS HAD ONGOING PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKES MAKING NOISE AND NOT BEING RESPONSIVE.  ON HER WAY TO HAVE THEM LOOKED AT AGAIN, SHE MADE A LEFT ONTO A MAJOR ROAD AND THE TRAFFIC IN FRONT OF HER WAS AT A DEAD STOP.  IT WAS THE RAV 4 IN FRONT OF HER, NOT HER BRAKES, THAT STOPPED HER CAR DEAD.  THANKFULLY, NO ONE WAS HURT.  TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, THE AIRBAG I FELT WOULD PROTECT HER DID NOT DEPLOY.  HOW MANY COMPLAINTS HAVE TO BE SUBMITTED BEFORE THINGS GET ADDRESSED BY A MANUFACTURER?  TO THINK I BOUGHT MY ONLY DAUGHTER A CAR WITH UNRELIABLE BRAKES AND AIRBAGS THAT DON'T WORK.  UNFORTUNATELY, LIKE A LOT OF OTHER CONSUMERS, WE FOUND THIS OUT THE HARD WAY.   *NLM",
