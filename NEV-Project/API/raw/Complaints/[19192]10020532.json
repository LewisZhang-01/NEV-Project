        "summary": "I DRIVE A 2000 FORD FOCUS WITH 32,000 MILES ON IT. I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY (I-44) AT 70 MPH SPEED WHEN THE SPRING ON THE STRUT OF THE FRONT PASSENGER TIRE BROKE. THE CAR SWIRLED, STARTED SMOKING, MADE SCREETCHING NOISE, AND WITH LOTS OF STRUGGLE AND DANGEROUS SWIRLS I PULLED UP ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE 3-LANE INTERSTATE. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO REMAIN IN THIS NARROW LANE BECAUSE THE DANGER WAS TOO HIGH, SO A POLICE OFFICER ESCORTED MY CAR ACROSS THREE LANES TO PULL IN INTO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY. AFTER MY CAR WAS TAKEN TO A REPAIR SHOP, I CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY TO REPORT THIS INCIDENT. FORD INFORMED THAT MY WARRANTY WAS UP A MONTH BEFORE THE INCIDENT AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO ABOUT IT. THEY SHOWED NO CONCERN REGARDING THIS DANGEROUS INCIDENT HAPPENING ON A 3 YEAR OLD VEHICLE. BESIDES THE TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE AND THE REPAIRS, THIS CAN LEAD TO MORE INCIDENTS OF THIS KIND, BUT FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE SHOWED NO INTEREST IN THIS CASE. UNBELIEVABLE. LAWSUIT WAITING TO HAPPEN. I WILL NEVER BUY A FORD PRODUCT AGAIN.    *NLM",
