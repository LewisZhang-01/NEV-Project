I ATTEMPTED TO USE THE DOOR MOUNTED CONTROLS, BUT THE DOORS DID NOT UNLOCK. I TRIED TO MANUALLY UNLOCK THE DOORS USING THE DOOR LOCKS IN THE ARMREST, BUT THE DOORS WOULD NOT OPEN. I ATTEMPTED TO USE THE KEY FOB REMOTE CONTROL, BUT DOORS DID NOT UNLOCK. THE DOOR LOCK LEVERS WOULD FLIP FROM THE LOCKED TO UNLOCKED POSITION, BUT THE DOORS WOULD NOT OPEN. I STARTED AND STOPPED THE ENGINE TO RESET THE DOOR LOCKS, BUT  THE DOORS DID NOT UNLOCK. I LOWERED THE SIDE WINDOW AND ATTEMPTED TO OPEN THE DRIVERS DOOR FROM THE OUTSIDE, BUT THE DOOR WOULD NOT OPEN.  I REPEATED THE ABOVE ACTIONS SEVERAL TIMES WITH NO SUCCESS. A PASSERBY WAS ABLE TO OPEN THE FRONT PASSENGER DOOR FROM OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE.     AFTER CLIMBING OUT THE FRONT PASSENGER DOOR, I ATTEMPTED TO OPEN THE OTHER THREE DOORS FROM OUTSIDE WITH NO SUCCESS. I USED MY KEY IN THE DOOR LOCK ON THE DRIVERS DOOR, BUT THE DOOR WOULD NOT UNLOCK AND OPEN. I REPEATED THIS SEVERAL TIMES WITH NO SUCCESS. OVER SOME MINUTES OF TRYING ALL THE ABOVE FROM OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE, THE TWO REAR DOORS FINALLY OPENED. THE DRIVERS DOOR WOULD NOT UNLOCK AND OPEN.     AFTER CLIMBING BACK INTO MY VEHICLE VIA THE PASSENGER DOOR, I STARTED TO DRIVE HOME. AFTER ABOUT 3 MILES I HEARD THE SOUND OF THE DRIVERS DOOR UNLOCK AND THE DOOR ACTUALLY CRACKED OPEN ON ITS OWN. I HAD TO PULL THE DOOR SHUT WHILE DRIVING. UPON REACHING MY HOUSE THE DRIVERS DOOR OPERATED NORMALLY.     NOTHING LIKE THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE.",
