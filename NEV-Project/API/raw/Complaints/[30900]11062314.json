THE FIRST ONE WAS CAUSED BY PROBABLY A SMALL ROCK WHILE DRIVING MID SPEED AND SPREAD IMMEDIATELY FROM THE PASSENGER-SIDE PERIMETER.  THE SECOND ONE WAS CAUSED BY UNKNOWN, MAYBE A ROCK, AS I DID NOT SEE NOR HEAR ANYTHING BUT OVERNIGHT SAW A CRACK IN THE CENTER THAT SPREAD VERY QUICKLY.  THE THIRD CRACK WAS CAUSED BY PROBABLY A SMALL ROCK THAT STARTED ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE PERIMETER.  I HAVE OWNED NICER CARS THAN THE PRIUS AND ALSO ONES LESS PRESTIGIOUS.  WHILE OWNING THESE CARS FOR 5+ YEARS AND DRIVING EXTENSIVELY, I HAVE NEVER, EVER SUFFERED MORE ROCK IMPACTS BY A WINDSHIELD THAT CAUSED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE THAN WHEN I HAVE DRIVEN THIS 2016 PRIUS.   THIS CAR SHOULD BE RE-EXAMINED FOR SAFETY AND ANGLES.  IN ADDITION, TOYOTA SUPPOSEDLY HAS HAD A BACKORDER OF THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF WINDSHIELD AND HAS NOT ALLOWED AFTER-MARKET PRODUCTION SO I AM FORCED TO EITHER USE MY INSURANCE OR PAY AN EXORBITANT AMOUNT OUT OF POCKET.",
