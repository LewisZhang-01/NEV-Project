MY HUSBAND CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND SPOKE TO ONE OF THE TECH'S, HE SAID ALL 4 WHEELS SHOULD HAVE A SENSOR.  WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR THERE TODAY THE SERVICE WRITER TOLD ME THE TECH COMPARED IT TO ANOTHER COUGAR AND FOUND NO SENSOR ON THE RIGHT FRONT. IF A COUGAR HAS ABS THERE WILL NOT BE ANY SENSORS, SO WHO KNOWS WHAT HE WAS COMPARING IT TO.  NO BRAKES WEAR EVEN. THE ONLY WAY I WILL BE HAPPY IF SOMEONE SENDS ME A PICTURE OF THE BRAKING SYSTEM.  MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN A TRUCK AND CAR TECH. FOR 30 YEARS AND HE SAID ALL FOUR WHEELS SHOULD HAVE A SENSOR. WHO ARE THEY KIDDING. *JB",
