AT MY 20,000 MILE SERVICE NO PROBLEMS WERE MENTIONED.  MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON TOO.  I HAD TO HAVE MY O2 SENSOR REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY. THE WARRANTY DID NOT COVER THE BRAKES.  I DO NOT RIDE THE BRAKES.  1 MONTH AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR I NOTICED THAT WHEN I START IT IN THE MORNING IT MAKES A SOUND LIKE AND OLD JUNKY CAR WOULD.  I HAD IT TO THE DEALER TWICE FOR THIS AND THEY SAID ITS NOTHING AND THAT'S THE WAY A V6 SOUNDS!  IT ONLY DOES IT ON THE FIRST START OF THE DAY.  I AM AFRAID IT WILL END UP BEING SOME VERY EXPENSIVE PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE.   9 MONTHS AFTER I HAD THE CAR THE ARM REST CAME APART AND HAD TO BE FIXED UNDER WARRANTY.  I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER VOLKSWAGEN AGAIN AND I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THEM TO MY FRIENDS WHO ARE MD'S AND RN'S AND CAN AFFORD NICE CARS. *JB",
