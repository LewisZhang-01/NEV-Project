THIS CAR HAD A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS WHICH CAUSED FORD TO REPLACE THE ENGINE, RE-FLASH THE COMPUTER, REPLACE CLUTCH.  THIS CAR HAD A STALLING PROBLEM THAT LEFT ME AFRAID TO DRIVE IT.  WHEN YOU WOULD DEPRESS THE CLUTCH, THE CAR WOULD SOMETIMES STALL.  THIS WOULD CAUSE THE LOSS OF BRAKES AND STEERING AND NEARLY CAUSED AN ACCIDENT.  FORD FINALLY AGREED TO BUY BACK THE CAR AND GET ME ANOTHER CAR, BUT I AM HAVING THE SAME STALLING PROBLEM WITH THAT 2003 COBRA AS WELL.  SATCHER FORD HAS INDICATED THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE A FIX YET.  FORD NEED TO LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IT WILL GET SOMEONE KILLED IF THEY DO NOT CORRECT IT.  *NLM",
