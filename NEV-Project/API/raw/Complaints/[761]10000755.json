WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING AND MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKES BUT WITH THE PARKING BRAKE FULLY ENGAGED, THE CAR ROLLED FORWARD ON MY DRIVEWAY AND ROLLED BACKWARDS WHILE I WAS WAITING FOR A TRAFFIC LIGHT CHANGEOVER.    SINCE THESE 2 INCIDENTS, I'VE ALWAYS KEEP MY FOOT ON THE BRAKES WAITING FOR LIGHT CHANGEOVER AND WHEN PARKED, I PUT THE CAR IN GEAR AND USE THE PARKING BRAKE AS WELL.     THE TIMES THE CAR ROLLED, I WAS ON A VERY SLIGHT INCLINE. SEVERAL PEOPLE ON EDMUNDS.COM AND EPHATCH.COM FORUM HAVE REPORTED SIMILAR EXPERIENCES.",
