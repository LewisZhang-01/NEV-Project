ADVISED MAZDA THAT I FELT THIS IS A MISDIAGNOSIS, PER NHTSB TECH SERVICE BULLETIN OF SPEED SENSOR ON TRANSMISSION WHICH PRESENTS SAME SYMPTOMS, THEY WOULD NOT CREDIT THE $2073 COST OF THE NEW TRANSMISSION, THE DEALER DID NOT SEE THIS TROUBLE WHICH IS WHAT I ORIGINALLY BROUGHT IN FOR SERVICE, AFTER 3 MORE RETURN VISITS TO SERVICE DEPT, THEY FINALLY REPLACE SPEED SENSOR, NOW PROBLEM IS GONE, BUT NOW I HAVE A NEW TRANSMISSION THAT I DID NOT NEED. THEY NEVER PRODUCED ANY DIAGNOSTIC BACK UP TO THE TRANSMISSION FAILING, I TOOK THEM AT THEIR WORD THAT THIS IS WHAT THE CAR NEEDED, WHEN ALL ALONG THE SPEED SENSOR FIXED THE TROUBLE. THEY WERE VERY UNCOOPERATIVE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE EXCEPT WHEN IT CAME TO TAKING OUR MONEY, AND AT ONE POINT WHEN I ASKED TO PLEASE LET ME TEST DRIVE WITH THE TECH, THE SERVICE MANAGER ADVISED ME, THEY HAD SPENT ENOUGH TIME ON THIS AND TO TAKE THE CAR AND LEAVE.  NOT UNTIL I RESEARCHED OTHER DRIVERS COMPLAINTS ON THE TRANSMISSION ON THIS CAR GOING AT AROUND 70000 MILES.  *JB",
