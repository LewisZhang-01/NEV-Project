        "summary": "MY WIFE WAS DRIVING DOWN A MAIN HIGHWAY, WHEN HER FORD FREESTAR LOST ALL POWER FROM THE TRANSMISSION.  SHE COASTED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROADWAY.  SHE TRIED TO PUT THE VEHICLE IN ANY GEAR AND ALL THAT WOULD MOVE WAS THE RPM GAUGE.  HER AND MY SON WERE LEFT STRANDED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROADWAY. THE VEHICLE HAD TO BE TOWED TO A MECHANIC SHOP, WHO TOLD US THAT THE THE VEHICLE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A NEW TRANSMISSION AND THAT IT WOULD COST US ABOUT $3000.  THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN WELL TAKEN CARE OF SINCE WE BOUGHT IT NEW.  THE VEHICLE ONLY HAS 70,000 MILES ON IT AND SHOULD NOT BE HAVING THE TRANSMISSION REPLACED.  IT APPEARS FROM EVERYTHING I HAVE LEARNED THAT THIS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS YEAR MODEL.  MY QUESTION IS, WHY HASN'T A RECALL BEEN ISSUED ON THIS PROBLEM?  NOT ONLY AM I OUT A TOW BILL AND THE COST OF A TRANSMISSION, MY FAMILY WAS LEFT STRANDED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROADWAY.  THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.",
