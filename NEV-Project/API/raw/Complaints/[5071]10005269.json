THIS PROBLEM IS ADDRESSED IN FORDMOTOR COMPANY'S REPAIR BULLITEN 98-13-4 DTD 07/06/98.  NOTWITHSTANDING HAVING THE CAR REPAIRED BY AN ASE CERTIFIED MECHANIC (NAPA APPROVED) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SERVICE BULLITEN THE PROBLEM HAS REOCCURED AFTER 3,000 MILES. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS CONDITION WHICH COULD RESULT IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT, PARTICULARLY SINCE THE PROBLEM ONLY OCCURS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS WHEN TRAFFIC CONDITIONS ARE ALREADY DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF WET CONDITIONS.",
