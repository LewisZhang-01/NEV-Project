        "summary": "I OWN A 2000 SUBARU OUTBACK LTD, WHITE VIN [XXX]. IT HAS APPROX. 63,000 MILES AND HAS HAD FOR THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS, AN ANTI-FREEZE SMELL AFTER THE  CAR HAS INITIALLY WARMED UP. AS IT TURNS OUT, I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE INTO THE NEAREST SUBARU DEALERSHIP FOR IT'S 60,000 MILE SERVICE AND WAS DISMAYED TO RECEIVE A CALL FROM THE SERVICE ADVISOR INFORMING ME THAT THE HEAD GASKET WAS GONE AND NEEDED REPLACING. IN THIS DAY AN AGE OF MODERN VEHICLES, A HEAD GASKET RARELY BECOMES DEFECTIVE AT 63,000 MILES; CHECK STATISTICS!!! I BELIEVE THAT THIS FAILURE IS DUE TO A DESIGN FLAW  WHEN SUBARU WENT TO THE 2.5L ENGINE SIZE AS MANY OTHER SUBARU OWNERS ARE NOW EXPERIENCING THIS UNWARRANTED REPAIR AT SUCH AN EARLY TIME FRAME.  AS THESE IRRITATED SUBARU OWNERS APPROACH THE 60,000 TO 80,000 MILE MARK AND START EXPERIENCING THESE HEAD GASKET REPLACEMENTS, YOU SHOULD BECOME INUNDATED WITH COMPLAINTS. BEFORE THIS OCCURRED, I RECOMMENDED SUBARU'S TO MAY PEOPLE, BUT WITH THIS EXPENSIVE REPAIR, WHICH SHOULD BE PARTLY OR WHOLLY COVERED BY SUBARU, I WILL NEVER RECOMMEND A SUBARU TO ANYONE EVER.     *NLM    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
