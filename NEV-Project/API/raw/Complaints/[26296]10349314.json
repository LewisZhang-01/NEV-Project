THEN AN IMMEDIATE DRAGGING FEELING AND SCRAPING OF METAL FROM THE REAR END FOLLOWED. THE CAR SWERVED AND SLOWED TO A STOP. NO ADDITIONAL VEHICLES WERE INVOLVED, BUT AN EASY COLLISION COULD HAVE RESULTED, IF NOT FOR THE FACT I WAS APPROACHING A LEFT TURN LANE AND WAS ABLE TO STEER CLEAR OF TRAFFIC. I CHECKED THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE AND THE AXLE WAS CLEANLY BROKEN IN TWO, AS IF A SEAM HAD SPLIT. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION, LIFE THREATENING IN MY OPINION IF I WAS DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. *TR",
