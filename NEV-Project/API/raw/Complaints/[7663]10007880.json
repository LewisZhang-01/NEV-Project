HAD I KNOWN ABOUT SUCH AN INHERENT BAD DESIGN I WOULD NEVER HAVE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE, LET ALONE ANY CHRYSLER PRODUCT. MY PARTICULAR UNIT HAS FAILED AT THE LOW MILEAGE OF 110,000 AND BECAME DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO FAILURE!  FURTHERMORE, DURING THE REPAIR PROCESS MANY OTHER COMPONENTS HAD TO BE REPLACED DUE TO THE REQUIRED TEAR DOWN TO ACCESS THE FAILED STEERING RACK COMPONENTS. IN ADDITION TO THE STEERING RACK FAILURE, THE FUEL RAIL GASKETS ALSO FAILED IN LEAKAGE AT THE SAME TIME.",
