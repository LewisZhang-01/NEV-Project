THE MECHANIC WORKING ON MY CAR HAD FOUND THAT BOTH OF THE ORIGINAL FACTORY REAR SPRINGS WERE BROKEN DIRECTLY BELOW THEIR PLASTIC COVERING ABOUT ONE-FIFTH FROM THE TOP OF THE SPRING.  HE HAD SAID THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL ESCORTS THAT HE HAD WORKED ON THAT HAD THE SAME BREAKAGE AT THE SAME SECTION OF EACH OF THE REAR SPRINGS.  HE HAD ADVISED ME TO CHECK TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY RECALLS OR SERVICE BULLETINS POSTED ON THIS PROBLEM.  I WAS ALSO TOLD TO BUY A NEW SET OF REAR TIRES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, AS MY PRESENT ONES HAVE IRREGULAR WEAR.  *JB     I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE WAS OR WILL BE A RECALL ON THIS PROBLEM.",
