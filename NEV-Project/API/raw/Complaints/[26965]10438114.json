I FIRST NOTICED THE HEADLIGHTS WENT OUT, THEN SAW THE ANTI THEFT LIGHT ILLUMINATE.  I TRIED DEPRESSING THE GAS PEDAL, BUT GOT NOTHING.  THANKFULLY, I WAS ABLE TO COAST OUT OF THE PASSING LANE, INTO THE RIGHT LANE, AND EVENTUALLY TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITHOUT ANY TRAGEDY.  ONCE ALONG THE ROADSIDE, I PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND TURNED THE KEY TO SHUT OFF MODE.  I THEN TURNED IT BACK ON, CAR STARTED UP FINE.  I TOOK IT TO MY REGULAR MECHANIC, HIS CODE READER FOUND NOTHING.  TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP I BOUGHT IT FROM, THEY FOUND NOTHING.  IT IS NOW AT A FORD DEALERSHIP, BUT MY GUESS IS THEY WILL FIND NOTHING.  I AM ON THE ROAD AT LEAST 4 OUT OF 5 DAYS A WEEK ON MAJOR HIGHWAYS.  I CANNOT AFFORD FOR THIS TO HAPPEN AGAIN.  I MAY NOT BE SO LUCKY NEXT TIME. *TR",
