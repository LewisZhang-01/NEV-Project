AFTER RUNNING FOR ABOUT 10 MIN WE GOT IN AND BEFORE EVEN BACKING OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY WE HEARD A LOUD POP.  IT SOUNDED LIKE SOMEONE SHOT OUR BACK WINDOW WITH A GUN.  WE SAW THE BACK WINDOW DIRECTLY BEHIND THE DRIVER'S SEAT WAS COMPLETELY SHATTERED.  THE TINT FILM HELD IT ALL TOGETHER, BUT IT WAS COMPLETELY SHATTERED.  WE GOT OUT TO SEE IF A BIRD FLEW INTO IT OR TO FIND ANY REASON AND NOTICED THERE WASN'T EVEN A PUNCTURE TO THE WINDOW FROM OUTSIDE.  IT WAS JUST COMPLETELY SHATTERED FROM THE INSIDE OUT.  MY HUSBAND WILL SPEND TODAY FINDING SOMEONE TO REPAIR AND WE'VE NOW LOOKED IT UP AND FOUND MANY COMMENTS OF OTHERS HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.  CAN YOU PLEASE HELP US ALL AND URGE FORD TO ISSUE A RECALL?",
