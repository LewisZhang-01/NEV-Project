TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN REGULARLY SERVICED AND HAS HAD NO PRIOR INDICATIONS OF TRANSMISSION TROUBLE (I.E. SLIPPING, SKIPPING, GRINDING OR USING TRANSMISSION FLUID)  2.  ACCORDING TO THE TRANSMISSION MECHANIC, THE SPLINES ON THE TORQUE CONVERTER SHEERED OFF, CAUSING THE TRANSMISSION TO BE STOP WORKING.  THIS HAS OCCURRED 1 TIME.  METAL SHAVINGS FROM THE TORQUE CONVERTER IN THE TRANSMISSION.  LUCKILY WE WERE ONLY DOING 30 MPH WHEN THE FAILURE OCCURRED AND WERE CLOSE TO HOME.    3.  THE TRANSMISSION IS BEING REBUILT W/ A NEW TORQUE CONVERTER.  ACCORDING TO THE TRANSMISSION SHOP, THE 2004-2007 FORD FREESTARS HAVE AN INHERENT DEFECT IN THE TORQUE CONVERTER.  IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE, A RE-MANUFACTURED TORQUE CONVERTER WITH REINFORCED SPLINES MUST BE INSTALLED AS THE FORD REPLACEMENT PART SUFFERS FROM THE SAME DESIGN FLAW.  APPROXIMATELY $2,200.00 TO RESOLVE THIS MANUFACTURERS DEFECT AND AT THIS TIME, FORD'S FIX INSTALLS THE SAME FAULTY TORQUE CONVERTER WHICH CAUSED THE TRANSMISSION FAILURE TO BEGIN WITH. *TR",
