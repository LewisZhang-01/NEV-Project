IT HAD 64,000 MILES ON IT AND APPEARED TO BE GOOD.  SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH THIS JEEP.  FIRST THE WIRING HARNESS, THEN THE TRANSMISSION, NOW A DIAGNOSIS TO REPLACE THE INTAKE AND EXHAUST MANIFOLD, REPLACED FUEL PUMP AND HAS A FAULTY FUEL GAUGE,  AND POSSIBLY THE STABILIZER BAR OR STEERING COMPONENTS.  THIS JEEP IS COSTING ME MORE IN REPAIRS THAN THE ACTUAL VALUE OF IT.  I FEAR THAT IT IS UNSAFE AND THAT I M FACING MORE EXPENSES IF I KEEP IT, BUT I AM STILL MAKING PAYMENTS ON IT.  DO I HAVE ANY RECOURSE AS FAR AS LEMON LAW PROTECTION, RECALLS, HELP!!!  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT.  *JB",
