        "summary": "WE PURCHASED A 2003 NISSAN ALTIMA S ON NOVEMBER 12, 2002.  WE NOTICED A ROUGH VIBRATION WHEN WE ARE SITTING AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT IN DRIVE AND WHEN WE HAVE IT IN PARK.  WE TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP THE NEXT DAY TO BE CHECKED AND WE WERE TOLD IT WAS NORMAL.  WE WANTED TO EXCHANGE THE VEHICLE FOR ANOTHER ALTIMA OF SAME VALUE BECAUSE WE HAVE FRIENDS WITH 2002-2003 ALTIMAS AND THEY ARE NOT HAVING THIS PROBLEM.  WE HAVE TAKEN IT BACK SEVERAL TIMES BUT THEY STILL CONTINUE TO SAY IT IS NORMAL.  ALSO, WE ARE HAVING A PROBLEM WITH ACCELERATION ON THIS VEHICLE.  WHEN YOU TAKE OFF IT HESITATES BEFORE IT PICKS UP SPEED AND THE TRANSMISSION DOESN'T SEEM TO BE CHANGING OUT SMOOTHLY.  WE AREN'T HAVING ANY LUCK WITH THE DEALERSHIP WE PURCHASED IT FROM.  IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMERS AFTER THEY GET YOUR $20,000 + CHECK.  I REALLY THINK THERE SHOULD BE A BETTER WAY FOR CUSTOMERS TO RECEIVE QUALITY SERVICE FROM THESE DEALERSHIPS AFTER PURCHASE.  WE FEEL LIKE WE PURCHASE A 2003 LEMON AND WE THINK THAT NISSAN CORP. SHOULD MAKE THESE DEALERSHIPS THAT ARE SELLING THEIR PRODUCTS SATISFY THE CUSTOMER BEFORE/AFTER THE SALE.      *TT",
