        "summary": "1-23-3    ID LIKE TO REPORT A PROBLEM WITH A GENERAL MOTORS ENGINE, MORE SPECIFICALLY THE BOLTS THEY'RE USING ON THE 3800 SERIES 2 V-6 (PROBABLY A CHEAP PRICED CHINESE PRODUCT). I ASKED AT MY BUICK DEALERSHIP IF THEY SEND INFORMATION TO GM ABOUT A PROBLEM A VEHICLE IS HAVING IF THEY SEE IT AS DANGEROUS OR SEE IT MORE THAN ONCE AND THE GUY LAUGHED... HA HA REAL FUNNY. MEANWHILE PEOPLE LIKE ME FIX A PROBLEM THAT MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR A RECALL, OR AT MINIMUM GM COULD QUIT BUYING DEFECTIVE BOLTS TO USE ON THE 3800 SERIES 2 ENGINE BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED WHEN SUDDENLY THEY CAN'T CONTROL A 3000 POUND VEHICLE GOING DOWN THE HIGHWAY.    I HAVE A 1997 BUICK PARK AVENUE (97,000 MILES). I'M DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN MY POWER STEERING PUMP JUST FALLS OFF OF THE CAR, YES IT LITERALLY FELL OFF. I SENT IT TOO MY LOCAL BUICK DEALER FOR REPAIR. THEY ARE FOR SOME REASON OUT OF THE BOLT THAT HE SAID SHEARED ITSELF OFF. THE NEXT DAY I CALL THE BUICK REPAIR SHOP TO ASK ABOUT IT SINCE THEY HAVE TO WAIT ON THE PART, AND HE CALLS ME MR. GRAY. I TELL HIM MY ACTUAL NAME AND HE APOLOGIZES AND INFORMS ME THAT THERE'S ANOTHER GUY'S CAR IN THERE AT THE MOMENT WHO HAD THAT EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED TO HIS CAR,... HIS POWER STEERING PUMP FELL OFF TOO.    THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD BECAUSE THE CAR ALL OF THE SUDDEN STEERS LIKE A TRACTOR WITH FLAT TIRES, FORTUNATELY I WAS ONLY GOING 25 MPH WHEN IT HAPPENED TO ME. A SMALLER MAN OR WOMAN COULD NOT LIKELY HANDLE CONTROLLING IT, AND GOD HELP THEM IF THEY'RE ON THE INTERSTATE DOING 70. AND YET THE DEALERSHIP SAYS THEY DON'T HAVE A WAY OR SYSTEM SET UP WITH GENERAL MOTORS TO REPORT STUFF LIKE THIS. HOW IS GM SUPPOSED TO KNOW? HOPE YOU CAN HELP SAVE PEOPLE BEFORE WE HEAR ABOUT THIS ON THE NEWS AS A TRAGEDY.    THANKS... KEN MCCLELLAND",
