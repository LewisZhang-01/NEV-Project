I BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALERSHIP, BUT THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. ALSO, THEY CHECKED THE TSB, BUT NONE ARE LISTED. I HAVE READ JEEP FORUMS AND LEARNED THAT SOME BELIEVE THE PROBLEM WITH THE 2011S IS THE BOOT, EITHER INNER OR OUTER OR BOTH. WHEN IT IS COLD OUTSIDE, THE BOOTS DON'T FLEX WELL--SO IT PUSHES THE VEHICLE OUT OF GEAR. I HAVE BEEN IN THE MIDDLE OF A TURN AND IT HAPPENS--HUGE SAFETY ISSUE. *TR",
