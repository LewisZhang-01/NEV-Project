LUCKILY, THE SUNROOF INTERIOR SLIDE COVER WAS CLOSED PREVENTING THE GLASS SHARDS TO FALL INTO THE VEHICLE.  TOOK CAR TO A LOCAL ACURA DEALER AND THEY DID NOT MENTION A RECALL AND NEEDED TIME TO ORDER A NEW PART AND SCHEDULE SERVICE.  DECLINED THEIR SERVICE AND WENT TO AN AUTO GLASS SERVICE FOR PENDING REPAIRS.  I BELIEVE THIS WAS NO FAULT OF MY OWN AND I WASN'T AWARE OF THIS SUNROOF ISSUE.  IF THE GUARD WAS NOT CLOSED MYSELF AND PASSENGERS WOULD MOST LIKELY GET HURT.",
