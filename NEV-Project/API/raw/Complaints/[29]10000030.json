WE HAVE BEEN TO THE DEALER 12 TIMES PRIOR AND EACH TIME THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE IT WORK BUT THERE HAS BEEN THREE CLOSE CALLS WHERE THE HORN DID NOT WORK AND A CAR BACKING ALMOST HIT MY CAR. WE HAD TO YELL TO MAKE THE OTHER CAR STOP! TODAY 12/11/02 WE HAD YET ANOTHER VERY CLOSE CALL AND THE DEALER FINALLY WAS ABLE TO SEE THERE IS A FAULT AS THE HORN DID NOT FUNCTION WHEN THE WHEEL IS TURNED. THEY SAID THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND MAY COST OVER $250 TO FIX! PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THIS IS A SAFETY ITEM AND SHOULD BE FIXED FREE BY THE MANUFACTURER. THANKS VERY MUCH!",
