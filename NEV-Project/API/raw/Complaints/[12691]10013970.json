ACCIDENT POTENTIAL AS WELL AS SOME REPORTED.  COSTLY REPLACEMENT FOR CONSUMER.  THIS HAS TURNED ME OFF TO CHRYSLER PRODUCTS AND I AM VERY UPSET.  I AM A SINGLE PARENT WITH TWO KIDS AND CAN'T AFFORD COSTLY REPAIR BILLS.  THIS IS OBVIOUS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT WITH SO MANY COMPLAINTS.  WHY ISN'T SOMETHING BEING DONE   TO HELP US CONSUMERS?  WE NEED SAFE, RELIABLE VEHICLES TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION  FOR OUR FAMILIES.  WHAT IS THE PROBLEM HERE?!  *JB",
