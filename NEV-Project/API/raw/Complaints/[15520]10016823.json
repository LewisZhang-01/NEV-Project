I TURNED ON THE NEWS ONLY TO SEE A STORY ABOUT THE GEN3 SEAT BELTS.  THESE ARE OBVIOUSLY FLAWED.  I TRUST THE NHTSA TO DO THE PROPER REVIEWING AND SEE THE HAZARD THAT THESE BELTS PRESENT.  DO THE RIGHT THING AND PUSH FOR A RECALL.  MY FAMILY'S LIVES DEPEND ON YOU.  YOU HAVE A LOUDER VOICE THAN I WILL EVER HAVE.",
