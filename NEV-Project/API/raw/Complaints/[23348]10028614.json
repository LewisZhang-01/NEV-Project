        "summary": "SINCE THE PURCHASE OF MY CAR AT 12,000 MILES, IT HAS SHAKEN AND VIBRATED VIOLENTLY.  WHEN I RUN MY DEFROST OR A/C THE PROBLEM GETS WORSE AND MY CAR STALLS  OUT.  I HAVE REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION AT 30,000 MILES AND REPLACED EVERYTHING THE DEALERSHIP INSTRUCTED.  ON JULY, 18, 2003 I MADE MY FINAL ATTEMPT TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  I TOOK THE CAR TO THE FORD DEALER AND AGAIN SPECIFIED THE PROBLEM AND SHOWED THEM EXACTLY WHAT I WAS EXPERIENCING.  I PICKED IT UP  LATER THAT AFTERNOON THEY HAD REPLACED THE VALVE AGAIN THAT I HAD JUST REPLACED IN JANUARY 2003.  I TURNED ON MY CAR AND RAN THE A/C AND I SAW NO IMPROVEMENT.  SO I ASKED TO SPEAK WITH A MANAGER WHO TOLD ME THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM THAT MY CAR SHOULDN'T STALL ANYMORE BUT THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY CAN DO TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM.  BASICALLY, WE PURCHASED A $13,000 DOLLAR CAR THAT NEVER RAN RIGHT AND CAN NOT BE REMEDIED.  NO ONE HAS A SOLUTION AND I'M EXPECTED TO BE SATISFIED WITH A CAR THAT SHAKES NON-STOP.  IF FORD KNOWS THIS IS OCCURING THEY NEED TO NOTIFY CUSTOMERS BEFORE THEY PURCHASE THE VEHICLE, INSTEAD OF LETTING THEM DRIVE AWAY IN A CAR THAT CAN NEVER BE FIXED.  I HAVE LOST ALL RESPECT FOR FORD AND WILL NEVER PURCHASE A VEHICLE FROM THEM AGAIN.  *AK",
