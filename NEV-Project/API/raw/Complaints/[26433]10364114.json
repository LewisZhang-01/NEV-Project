        "summary": "VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AUTHORIZED SATURN DEALER, 2003 SATURN ION HAD CONTINUOUS HIGH ENGINE IDLE AFTER BEING DRIVEN AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. IF VEHICLE WAS SHUT OFF THE POWER CONTROL MODULE(PCM) COMPUTER RESET IT SELF. SATURN DEALER SERVICED THE VEHICLE BY RE-PROGRAMMING THE PCM( 10/21/10) AS PER A ISSUED SERVICE BULLETIN OF 4/2004 . THIS DID NOT WORK. THEN THEY ADVISED A SPRING IN THROTTLE BODY (ENGINE) WAS BAD AND REPLACED SPRING ( 10/28/10). THIS ALSO DID NOT WORK, ENGINE STILL HAS HIGH IDLE AND I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE BACK ON 11/2/10 TO THE SERVICE DEALER.. SERVICE DEALER THEN HOOKED UP CAR TO COMPUTER AND HAS SER TECH DRIVE VEHICLE FOR OVER 25 MILES, 2 TIMES ; AND THENFOUND ANOTHER PROBLEM. THEY INDICATED THAT THE POWER CONTROL MODULE COMPUTER HAD A SHORT AND CAUSED A BURNED OUT COMPONENT IN THE COMPUTER. SINCE THE SATURN IS NO LONGER BEING PRODUCES, THE COMPUTER WHICH MUST BE REPLACED IS ON BACK ORDER; AND UNKNOWN WHEN PART WILL ARRIVE. THE SATURN SERVICE DEALER ( INGERSOLL AUTO IN DANBURY CT) ADVISED THAT THE VEHICLE SHOULD NOT BE DRIVEN AS IT WAS A SAFETY HAZARD, SINCE THE COMPUTER CONTROLS NOT ONLY THE ENGINE BUT THE ABS BRAKING SYSTEM. AT THIS TIME UNKNOWN WHEN A PART WILL ARRIVE AS IT IS ON BACK ORDER. IN SEARCHING THE INTERNET I FOUND NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM PERSON WHO ALSO HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE POWER CONTROL MODULE COMPUTER. I BELIEVE THAT GM/SATURN HAS HAD FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROBLEM AND SHOULD HAVE TAKEN CARE OF THIS PROBLEM PRIOR; AND AS OTHER OWNERS OF SATURNS ARE HAVING THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM THEN GM SHOULD BE MAKING REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR THIS COMPUTER MORE AVAILABLE TO SATURN OWNERS. INGERSOLL AUTO IN DANBURY CT HAS ADVISED ME THAT THEY DO NOTKNOW WHEN THE REPLACEMENT COMPUTER WILL BE AVAILABLE AS THERE IS NO PART AVAILABLE IN THE ENTIRE USA. PART WILL HAVE TO BE MADE BY GM AND UNKNOWN WHEN THIS WILL HAPPEN. SO MY 2003 SATURN ION MUST BE LEFT AT THE DEALER UNTIL A REPLACEMENT COMPUTER IS SENT BY GM , SO MY CAR CAN BE REPAIRED. *TR",
