        "summary": "WE PURCHASED OUR 2001 FORD FOCUS ZX3 IN OCTOBER OF 2001.  DURING THE FIRST YEAR WE EXPERIENCED SEVERAL PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKES.  THESE PROBLEMS INCLUDED THE BRAKES GRABBING AT VERY LOW SPEEDS, SQUEALING AND NOISE ISSUES, AND LOW PERFORMANCE BRAKING.  WE HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP OF PURCHASE SEVERAL TIMES FOR REPAIR.  THE DEALERSHIP FINDS AND REPAIRS THE PROBLEM EVERY TIME WITHOUT CHARGE.  THE REASON FOR THIS COMPLAINT IS THAT ON MAY 13TH 2003 THE BRAKES TEMPORARILY FAILED TO ENGAGE MAKING THE VEHICLE UN-SAFE TO DRIVE.  I HAVE CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP'S CUSTOMER RELATIONS MANAGER AND I AM WAITING FOR A RESOLUTION.  I WANTED TO RELAY A MESSAGE TO THE NHTSA NOW DUE TO THE FACT THAT SEVERAL REPAIRS HAVE BEEN MADE AND SOMETHING OTHER THAN A REPAIR SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO FIX THIS PROBLEM AT AN EARLIER TIME.  *JB",
