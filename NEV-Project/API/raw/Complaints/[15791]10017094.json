WITHIN A FEW DAYS IT WORE OFF AGAIN.  CHEVROLET WILL NOT REPAINT THE AFFECTED AREAS STATING IT IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE.  THE DEALER STATES THEY BELIEVE IT IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT IN DESIGN.  THEY ALSO STATED I WOULD NEED TO PUT RUNNING BOARDS AND MOLDED MUD FLAPS ON TO PREVENT THE PROBLEM FROM GETTING WORSE.  THEY ARE HOWEVER NOT WILLING TO PUT THEM ON AT THEIR EXPENSE.  IF THIS WAS AN ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE THAN ALL VEHICLES WOULD HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM NOT JUST ME.  IN SPEAKING TO CHEVROLET CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE I WAS TOLD THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM WITH THE TRAILBLAZERS HOWEVER THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.   *NLM",
