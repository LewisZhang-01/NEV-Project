        "summary": "TWO NIGHT AGO I NOTICED THAT THE INSTRUMENT LIGHTS ON MY VEHICLE WOULD  SHUTOFF IMMEDIATELY AFTER TURNING OFF THE HEADLIGHTS.  THEY NEXT MORNING I WENT TO MY CAR AND NOTICED THAT NOT ONLY WERE THE INSTRUMENT LIGHTS ON BUT ALSO THE REAR LICENSE PLATE LIGHTS.  I WENT THROUGH THE DAY WITH BOTH ON WHEN I REMEMBERED I CHANGED THE LICENSE PLATE BULB LIGHTS THE PREVIOUS DAY.  THINKING THAT  WAS THE PROBLEM I OPENED MY TRUNK AND LOOKED AT THE LIGHTS AND NOTICED THE WIRES LEADING TO THE TRUNK.  WHEN I LIFTED THE TRUNK LID ALL THE LIGHTS TURNED OFF.  I SHUT THE TRUNK AND PROCEED INSIDE MY HOUSE WHEN THE LIGHTS CAME BACK ON RIGHT AS I STEPPED THROUGH THE DOOR.  I WENT BACK TO THE CAR AND OPENED THE TRUNK WHICH IN WHEN I HEARD THE NOISE OF SPARKS COMMONS FROM THE WIRES LEADING FROM THE TRUNK LID INTO THE CAR.  I IMMEDIATELY NOTICED A LARGE AMOUNT OF SMOKE COMING FROM THE WIRED AND PROCEEDED TO IMMEDIATELY DISCONNECT MY BATTERY WHICH IS LOCATED IN MY TRUNK.  AFTER I DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY, I LOOKED AT THE REMAINS WHERE THE SPARKS HAD COME FROM, THE WIRES WERE ALL MELTED AND FRAYED.    I RE-COATED ALL THE WIRES WITH ELECTRICAL TAPE.  THIS WAS NOT THE ONLY INCIDENT REGARDING WIRES.  I FEEL THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THESE WIRED.  I FEW MONTHS EARLIER I NOTICED FRAYING OF WIRED IN THE SAME VICINITY.  THE WIRE COATING IS TO THIN AND OVER TIME THE WIRES MOLD TOGETHER TO FORM ONE WHICH CAUSES THEM TO TOUCH ONE ANOTHER CREATING A VERY POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION.  HAD I NOT SEEN THOSE LIGHTS COME BACK ON, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.  THIS CAR HAS BEEN MAINTAINED BY THE HIGHEST STANDARDS, AND REGARDLESS THE WIRES ARE ON THE INSIDE OF THE CAR.  I POSTED A MESSAGE ON A BMW FORUM WHEN THE EVENT INITIALLY HAPPENED AND MANY PEOPLE REPORTED HAVING SIMILAR SYMPTOMS AND MANY WITH EVEN NEWER MODELS REPORT SEEING SIGNS OF FRAYING AND WIRES COMING THROUGH THE COATING.   *NLM",
