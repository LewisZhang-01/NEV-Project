VEHICLE PAUSED, SHUTTERED AND ENGINE SEEMED TO BE WORKING BUT TRANSMISSION WOULD NOT ENGAGE COMPLETELY.  WE FELT THAT WE COULD HAVE BEEN REAR ENDED AND KILLED.  THIS WAS THREE DAYS AFTER NISSAN HAD REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION FOR SHUTTERING AT 19 MPH OVER A SIX MONTH PERIOD.  AFTER STOPPING SEVERAL TIMES THE VEHICLE REACTED AS CLOSE TO NORMAL AS WE WOULD EXPECT, JUST IN TIME TO GET HOME.  WE HAVE BROUGHT THIS VEHICLE TO THE DEALER SHIP FOR PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG LIGHT SHOWING IT WAS OFF, WHEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON, FOR BACK UP SENSOR ACTING AS THOUGH OFF BUT ACTUALLY OFF, THE SMELL OF ANTIFREEZE AND NO LEAKS AND LAST THE BRAKES DELAYING.    NISSAN CONTINUED UNTIL RECENTLY STATED THAT IT WAS NORMAL.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS SITES STATING THESE SAME ISSUES.  WE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED, THIS IS SERIOUS, NO POWER ON THE EXPRESSWAY.  *JS",
