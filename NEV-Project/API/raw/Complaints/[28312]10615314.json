THEY CLAIM ITS FROM DRIVING SALTED ROADS BUT WHILE I WAS IN THE WAITING ROOM TWO OTHER CUSTOMERS WALKED IN WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. I BELIEVE THIS IS A WARRANTY ISSUE. THEY WANTED OVER $500 TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. I TOOK IT TO ANOTHER REPAIR SHOP TO HAVE THE SAME WORK DONE FOR ONLY $200. THEY HAVE TO NOW REPLACE MY MUFFLER AND FLANGE. THE REPAIR SHOP SAID IT LOOKS LIKE THEY USED BAD MATERIALS ON THE MUFFLER AND THAT THEY HAVE SERVICED MANY 2008-2011 VERSA'S THIS YEAR WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. IT BREAKS OFF RIGHT AT THE PART WHERE THE PIPE MEETS THE EXHAUST. THIS IS TERRIBLE. I AM A SINGLE MOTHER AND STRUGGLING AS IT IS TO GET BY WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT FAULTY OR POORLY MADE PRODUCTS. THEY SHOULD RECALL THE VEHICLES AND REPLACE THESE PROBLEMATIC PARTS.  *TR",
