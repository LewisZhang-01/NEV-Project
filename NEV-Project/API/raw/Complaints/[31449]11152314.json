NOVEMBER 2018 WE EXPERIENCED LOW 30 TEMPS AND WHEN THE TEMPS RAISED BACK TO 50S MY WINDSHIELD SPONTANEOUSLY CRACKED AGAIN. IN THE EXACT SAME SPOT. ONCE AGAIN DEALERSHIP IS CLAIMING A SMALL PEBBLE HAS CAUSED THIS DAMAGE. I CAN'T BUY THAT A PEBBLE WOULD HIT THE EXACT SAME SPOT AND CAUSE THE WINDSHIELD TO CRACK THE EXACT SAME WAY TWICE.  I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE AND IT SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM AMONG OUTBACKS OF THIS YEAR.",
