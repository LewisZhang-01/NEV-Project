ON 9TH MAY I GAVE THE TRUCK FOR SUGGESTED REPAIRS AND RECEIVED BACK SAME EVENING.  NEXT MORNING 10TH OF MAY 2003 , SATURDAY , TRAFFIC WAS VERY LIGHT ,I WENT TO WORK HEADED 91 WEST , ON RAMP CARMENITA & EXITED GARFIELD . USE OF BRAKES WAS PRACTICALLY NOT REQUIRED .  THE TRUCK WAS PARKED ALL DAY. AROUND 6 IN THE EVENING HEADED FWY EAST 91 , IN MEDIUM TRAFFIC ,  WHEN THE TWO CARS IN FRONT OF ME HAVE A FENDER BENDER , AND STOP IN THE FAST LANE  I AM WATCHING ALL THIS AS I  AM GOING ABOUT 40 MPH.  I PRESS THE BRAKES.   THE BRAKES WORK JUST A BIT HALF WAY THEN BECOME LIKE WET SPONGE , GIVE WAY AND THE PEDAL GOES DOWN.  THE BRAKES FAIL , AND I CAN'T STOP THE TRUCK.  I HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME AT ABOUT 30 MILES PER HOUR.  A POLICE REPORT IS PROCESSED, THE FRONT FENDER PUNCTURED MY TRUCKS RADIATOR, AND THE TRUCK WAS TOWED TO CERRITOS DODGE .  MY FAMILY ARRIVES . MY WIFE, DAUGHTER, AND MY SON ALL 3 CHECK THE BRAKES AND THE DIDN'T WORK.  THE FLEET MANAGER MR DAN PETTY , WHO WAS ON DUTY AT THIS TIME, AND HAD NEGOTIATED THE SALE OF THIS VEHICLE TO ME , PHYSICALLY TESTED THE BRAKES . HE CONFIRMED THE BRAKES DID NOT WORK. THERE WAS NO PRESSURE - NO BRAKES.  MR DAN PETTY DISCUSSED WITH HIS SALES STAFF, MR RICO BARRIOS AND THE MANAGER ON DUTY    THEY CONFIRMED THAT THIS WOULD BE A MANUFACTURING DEFECT, AND WOULD HAVE TO BE LOOKED INTO BY CHRYSLER CORPORATION.  TODAY IS 1 WEEK PAST - THE 17TH OF MAY 2003, ANOTHER SATURDAY .  THE TRUCK HAS BEEN PARKED AT THE CERRITOS DODGE DEALERSHIP SERVICE LOT .  NO ONE FROM CHRYSLER HAS SHOWN UP.  THE SERVICE PERSONNEL JUST SAY- WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING .THIS IS A CHRYSLER PROBLEM BECAUSE IT IS A BRAND NEW TRUCK WITH ONLY 2591 MILES . *JB  NO ONE IS TAKING ANY ACTION.   PLEASE HELP",
