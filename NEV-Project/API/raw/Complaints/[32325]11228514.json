THE CAR HAS 13,000 MILES ON IT..  THE CRACKS CAUSE THE TIRES TO LOSE AIR.  THE RIMS ARE NOT REPAIRABLE AND GM REFUSES TO WARRANT THE DEFECTIVE RIMS.  THE DAMAGE OCCURRED IN NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS.  THIS CAR IS STORED IN THE WINTER MONTHS AND IS NOT DRIVEN FOR 6 MONTHS OF THE YEAR.  I HAD A TIRE GAUGE INDICATE THAT MY RIGHT REAR TIRE WAS DOWN TO 24LBS.  I PUMPED UP THE TIRE AND WATCHED IF FOR A COULPE OF DAYS.  IT CONTINUED TO LOOSE AIR PRESSURE SO I TOOK IT TO A QUALIFIED TIRE DEALERSHIP THINKING I HAD A PUNCTURED TIRE.  THE SHOP NOTIFIED ME THAT THE TIRE WAS FINE BUT THAT THE RIM HAD 3 ONE INCH CRACKS IN IT.  I WENT TO MY CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP HAD THEM DOCUMENT THE ISSUE TAKE PICTURES AND NOTIFY GM OF MY CLAIM.  GM REJECTED THE CLAIM WITH IN 2 HOURS AND CLAIMED IT WAS DUE TO ROAD HAZZARDS.",
