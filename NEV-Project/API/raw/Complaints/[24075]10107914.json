JUST ONE TIME, SO I STARTED LOOKING AROUND THE INTERIOR OF THE CAR.  I NOTICED A HOLE BETWEEN THE REAR PASSENGER WINDOW AND THE REAR WINDOW.  MY ALERO WAS A 2 DOOR.  WHEN I GOT WHEN I COULD PULL OVER THERE WERE FLAMES  COMING FROM THE HOLE. I WAS UNABLE TO PUT THEM OUT. I CALLED 911.  BY TIME THE FIRE TRUCKS ARRIVED THE CAR WAS FULLY ENGULFED IN FLAMES AND WAS BEYOND SAVING.  THE ONLY THING LEFT OF IT WAS THE BODY AND THE ENGINE.  *NM",
