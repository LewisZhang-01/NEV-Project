        "summary": "WE WERE LOOKING AT THE STROLLER/CAR SEAT COMBINATIONS AND WE FOUND THAT MOST HAVE THE EASY FOLD OPTION HAVE A MAJOR DEFECT - THEY FOLD OUTWARDS INSTEAD OF INWARDS.   ON MOST MODELS, IF THE CAR SEAT IS IN THE STROLLER WHEN THE EASY FOLD IS PRESSED, IT EITHER SHOOTS THE CAR SEAT OUT OF THE STROLLER (LIKE AN EJECTION BUTTON), OR IT SENDS THE CAR SEAT SMASHING INTO THE GROUND HEAD FIRST WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE STROLLER BEHIND IT.  IF A BABY WAS IN THE CAR SEAT, IT WOULD BE A FATAL BLOW, OR CAUSE SERIOUS BRAIN DAMAGE.  OBVIOUSLY, YOU WOULD NOT PRESS THE BUTTON IF A BABY WAS IN THE SEAT, BUT A TODDLER WOULDN'T KNOW THAT.  THE EASY FOLD IS SO EASY TO DO, A TODDLER CAN EASILY FIGURE IT OUT, OR IN ONE CASE IN PARTICULAR, I MANAGED TO SNAG MY JACKET ON THE BUTTON AND IT RELEASED.    I KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T LEAVE A BABY UNATTENDED IN A STROLLER, BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY ANYONE WOULD TAKE THE CHANCE.    WE NOTICED THIS ON ABOUT 90% OF THE EASY FOLD STROLLER/CAR SEAT COMBINATIONS.  WE SAW THIS ON MULTIPLE MANUFACTURERS' STROLLER'S AT MULTIPLE STORES.   *JB",
