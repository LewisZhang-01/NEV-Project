        "summary": "PURCHASED 2002 MODEL IN 10/01.  THREE WEEKS AFTER PURCHASE STEERING WHEEL WAS SHAKING AND LOOSE.  TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER, THE BOLT IN THE STEERING WHEEL CAME UNSECURED.  THIS WAS NOT DUE TO CUSTOMER ERROR.  IN 2002 THE UPHOLSTERY OVER THE CARGO SPACE WAS HANGING DOWN FROM THE CEILING AND THE FOAM INSULATION AROUND THE DOOR (REAR PASSENGER SIDE) WAS NOT SECURE.  I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER.  THE UPHOLSTERY WAS FIXED BUT THE INSULATION WAS NOT.  AT THAT TIME I ALSO COMPLAINED ABOUT THE VEHICLE IDLING WHEN IN NEUTRAL.  IT WAS ALSO VIBRATING AND SKIPPING WHEN IN NEUTRAL.  THE VEHICLE WAS ALLEGEDLY CHECKED WITH NOT PROBLEMS.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO HAVE THE INSULATION REPAIRED AND THE IDLING/VIBRATION CHECKED.  THE INSULATION WAS REPAIRED.  THE MECHANIC STATED THE CAR WAS FINE.  IDLING/VIBRATION AND SKIPPING STILLS CONTINUES TODAY.  ALSO THE VEHICLE SLIPPED OUT OF GEAR AND CRASHED INTO A POLE.  THE CAR WAS NOT ON AND THE DOORS WERE LOCKED.  I TRIED TO UNLOCK IT WITH THE REMOTE KEY.  IT CONTINUED TO MAKE A CLICKING SOUND BUT THE DOOR WOULD NOT OPEN.  THE LOCKS WOULD SOMETIMES JAM.  HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE NUMEROUS TIMES FOR THESE PROBLEMS.  NOT CORRECTION.  AT THIS TIME I AM COLLECTING ALL DOCUMENTATION AND SUBMITTING A LETTER TO FORD MOTOR COMPANY.",
