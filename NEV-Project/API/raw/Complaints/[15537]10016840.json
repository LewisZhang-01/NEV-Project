        "summary": "I AM EXPERIENCING A MALFUNCTIONING NUMBER 1 SPARK PLUG FOR MY 2001 MAZDA MPV DX.  PRIOR TO THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ILLUMINATING, THE VEHICLE EXPERIENCES SERIOUS HESITATION WHEN SPEEDING UP.  I LIVE NEAR MANY RAILROAD CROSSINGS AND THE HESITATION IS SERIOUS ENOUGH FOR ME TO QUESTION WHETHER THE VEHICLE WILL STOP ALTOGETHER.  I HAVE HAD THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT SERVICED THREE TIMES.  EACH TIME THE DEALER CLAIMS THAT THE NUMBER 1 SPARK PLUG IS CRACKED.  THE SPARK PLUG IS COVERED BY THE STANDARD WARRANTY, SO THE DEALER REPLACES IT WITHOUT QUESTION.  I AM CONCERNED WITH THE SITUATION WHEN MY WARRANTY RUNS OUT, SOON, WHETHER THIS PROBLEM WILL CONTINUE.  REPLACING THE SPARK PLUG IS NOT A TRIVIAL TASK.  I CURRENTLY HAVE 39,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE AND HAVE OWNED IT FOR 2.5 YEARS.  THE STANDARD WARRANTY IS 3YRS/50,000MILES.    I WOULD LIKE A PERMANENT SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM, WHETHER IT BE REPLACING THE ENGINE OR VEHICLE ITSELF.  THANK YOU.    SINCERELY,  ROBERT PLATA",
