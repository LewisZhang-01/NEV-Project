        "summary": "STARTED TRUCK ONE MORNING RIGHT BEFORE THANKSGIVING AND NO LIGHTS DISPLAYED IN THE CONTROL DASH PANEL. GREAT RIGHT BEFORE A PLANNED TRIP. NONE OF THE GAUGES WORKED.  BEGAN DRIVING AND THE RADIO STOPPED WORKING. HIT A BUMP IN THE ROAD AND SOMETHING BEEPED AND THEY CAME BACK ON FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN WENT BACK OFF, AND THIS TYPE OF ELECTRICAL BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE RIGHT BEFORE THANKSGIVING.  ON OCCASION I CAN JUST SHUT THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR AND THE DISPLAY PANEL GAUGES AND LIGHTS BEGIN WORKING FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN WITHOUT WARNING THE DASH IS BLANK AGAIN. SOMETIMES I'M LUCKY AND THEY STAY ON FOR 50MILES BEFORE GOING OUT AGAIN.  I PUT FUEL IN THE TRUCK TODAY 01-13-2013 IN SULFUR OKLA AND NO FUEL GAUGE.  IT DIDN'T REGISTER AND THE DISPLAY LIGHTS BEGAN GOING OFF AND ON. I STOPPED IN PAULS VALLEY OKLA FOR A COKE, WHILE IDLING, THE OUTSIDE TEMP GAUGE CLIMBED FROM 29 ACTUAL DEGREES TO 86DEGREES IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES BUT WHEN I BEGAN DRIVING AGAIN THE OUTSIDE TEMP WENT BACK DOWN TO 29DEGREES. ON 2 OCCASIONS WHILE ON I-35 THE GAUGES WOULD BEEP, RESET AND GO BACK OFF.  I DROVE FROM ATOKA OKLA TO THE TEXAS PANHANDLE WITH NO WAY OF TELLING MY SPEED, FUEL GAUGE, NO TEMP GAUGE NO BLINKERS TO SIGNAL LANE CHANGES, I EVEN TRIED THE EMERG. FLASHERS AND THEY WOULDN'T WORK EITHER.  I'M REALLY AFRAID THERE IS GOING TO BE A FIRE IN THE DASH OR SOMETHING AND I'LL LOOSE EVERYTHING, AND NO ONE SEEMS TO CARE. IT SEEMS TO BE ALL ABOUT THE SALE. MY WARRANTY IS ALMOST UP AND NO ONE CARES!, THIS IS NOT NORMAL! BEFORE I LEFT ON MY TRIP 01-08-2013 TO OKLA. I CALLED THE DEALER GENE MESSER WHERE I BOUGHT THE TRUCK, AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD HAVE A SERVICE MAN CALL.  WELL IT'S THE 14TH AND NO CALL. THERE IS DEFIANTLY SOMETHING WRONG WHEN YOU SPEND OVER 40,000 DOLLARS ON A VEHICLE AND AFRAID YOUR GOING TO GET A SPEEDING TICKET, BUT WORSE BURN UP IN IT OR GET KILLED. PLEASE HELP. *TR",
