IT TOOK SEVERAL TRIES OF ME PUSHING THE START BUTTON FOR THE CAR TO START.  THAT DAY I BROUGHT IT TO HONDA AND HONDA TOLD ME IT WAS A BAD BATTERY SO THEY REPLACED IT. THREE MONTHS LATER THE SAME ISSUE HAPPENED EXCEPT THIS TIME THE CAR WOULD NOT START. I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO HONDA AND THEY SAID IT WAS A BAD BATTERY AND REPLACED IT.  THIS CONTINUES TO HAPPEN EVERY THREE-SIX MONTHS HOWEVER HONDA IS NO LONGER REPLACING THE BATTERY AS THEY CANNOT DUPLICATE THE ISSUE.  THERE ARE NO LIGHTS BEING LEFT ON IN MY CAR.  I DO NOT HAVE AN ALARM SYSTEM.  THE CAR WILL BE PARKED OVER NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING OR EARLY AFTERNOON IT WILL NOT START OR TAKE SEVERAL TRIES OF ME PUSHING THE START BUTTON FOR IT TO START. IT WILL MAKE A CRANKING SOUND WHEN IT TRIES TO START BUT WILL NOT CATCH OR TAKES SEVERAL TRIES.  HONDA HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE CAR STARTING FOR THE 2015 CRV MODEL BUT STATED THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FIX IT.",
