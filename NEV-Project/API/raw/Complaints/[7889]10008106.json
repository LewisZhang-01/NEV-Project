I ASSUMED THAT WHEN THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND THE MANUAL SUGGESTED \"A TANK OF BAD GAS\" OR SIMILAR PROBLEMS THAT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT SERIOUS.  AFTER HAVING MY CAR TOWED TO MY DEALER, I WAS VERY SURPRISED WHEN MY DEALER INFORMED ME THAT THE INTAKE MANIFOLD HAD CRACKED AND COOLANT HAD INFILTRATED MY CYLINDERS.  THIS \"MINOR\" REPAIR ENDED UP COSTING $1836 AFTER REPLACING THE MANIFOLD, GASKETS, HOSES, AND THERMOSTAT.   I DO NOT HAVE MUCH TRUST IN MY VEHICLE NOR THE AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURER WHO KNOWS THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH MY YEAR AND MODEL OF CAR AND DOES NOTHING TO WARN OWNERS OF THIS PROBLEM.  I FEEL THAT I SHOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR THE PARTS AND LABOR TO REPLACE A MANUFACTURER MISTAKE.   *JB",
