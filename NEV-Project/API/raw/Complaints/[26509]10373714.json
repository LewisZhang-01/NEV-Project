        "summary": "THE CAR IS A 2003 CHEVROLET MALIBU. THE CAR WAS PURCHASED USED AND THEREFORE THE EVENTS LEADING UP THE FAILURE ARE NOT KNOWN. THE PROBLEM THAT THE CAR HAS IS THAT THE RPMS INCREASE DRAMATICALLY WHILE DRIVING. THIS MAKES THE CAR DIFFICULT TO STOP AND EXTREME PRESSURE MUST BE APPLIED TO THE BRAKES TO STOP AND KEEP THE CAR STOPPED. WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STOPPED AND THE PROBLEM IS OCCURRING, THE ENGINE CAN BE HEARD MAKING LOUDER THAN USUAL NOISES. WHEN THE RPMS INCREASE, THE SPEED OF THE CAR INCREASES WITHOUT THE GAS PEDAL BEING PRESSED. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP THE CAR MOVING AT A REASONABLE SPEED BECAUSE OF THIS. AT THE PRESENT TIME, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS ON, BUT THE ACTIVATION OF  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT DOES NOT USUALLY OCCUR AT THE SAME TIME AS THE PROBLEM DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE PROBLEM OCCURS AT AN OF FOUR TIMES A WEEK AND OCCURS MORE OFTEN WHEN THE CAR IS DRIVEN ON BACK ROADS INSTEAD OF HIGHWAYS. *TR",
