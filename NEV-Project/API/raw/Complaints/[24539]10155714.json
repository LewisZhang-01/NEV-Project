        "summary": "AS I WAS PULLING OUT OF A GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT, MY 2003 JETTA GLI VR6 BEGAN TO SPUTTER AND LOSE POWER.  ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND WOULD STAY LIT OR START BLINKING AS I TRIED TO DRIVE HOME.  I CONTACTED VW ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE ALONG WITH MY VW DEALERSHIP (STRONG VW, SLC UT), AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT I MUST BRING IT IN.  SEEING THAT I WAS BARELY GOING TO MAKE IT HOME I CONTACTED ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE WHICH WAS PROVIDED WITH MY JETTA AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY COULD TOW IT TO THE NEAREST VW DEALERSHIP (NOT WHERE I ORIGINALLY PURCHASED OR HAD MY CAR SERVICED) TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT.  NEEDLESS TO SAY IT WAS ACTUALLY CLOSER FOR ME TO DROP OFF THE JETTA AT THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP RATHER THAN TAKE IT HOME, SO I DID THAT.  I FOUND OUT THE FOLLOWING MORNING THAT THE IGNITION COILS WERE BAD AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  THAT WAS DONE UNDER WARRANTY AND APPARENTLY EVERYTHING WAS FINE.  THREE DAYS LATER, EACH AND EVERY TIME I STARTED MY JETTA A NOXIOUS SMELL WOULD FILL THE CABIN.  I REPORTED THIS TO MY ORIGINAL DEALERSHIP AND HAD IT IN FOR SERVICE TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  AFTER 5 DAYS OF TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS THEY INFORMED THAT SINCE THEY COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.  IRONICALLY IT HASN'T HAPPENED SINCE.  MY MAJOR COMPLAINT IS THAT IN THE YEAR AND A HALF THAT I HAVE OWNED MY JETTA, I HAVE HAD IT IN FOR NON-TRADITIONAL OR NON-SCHEDULED SERVICE MORE THAN 3 TIMES.  MY MAJOR FEAR IS THAT WHEN THE WARRANTY RUNS OUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT.  I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL VW CUSTOMER FOR 20+ YEARS AND HAVEN'T HAD THIS MANY PROBLEMS WITH MY PREVIOUS 4 VW VEHICLES COMBINED.  SADLY ENOUGH, I POSSIBLY MAY NEVER BUY OR LEASE A VW AGAIN! *JB",
