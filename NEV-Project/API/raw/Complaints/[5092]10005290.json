        "summary": "HAS BEEN INTO THE DEALERSHIP ON NUMEROUS OCCASSIONS, SINCE DECEMBER 2002. A NEW SEAT BELT WAS ORDERED \"TWICE\". THE SECOND ONE ORDERED WAS DUE TO THE TECHNICIAN NOT BEING COMFORTABLE WITH IT. JANUARY 20, 2003 WHILE DRIVING AT 65 MPH, HAD TO COME TO A PANIC STOP, SEAT BELT ON DRIVER'S SIDE DID NOT LOCK. A FORD MOTOR CO. ENGINEER NOW STATES THAT THE SEAT BELT IS WORKING AS DESIGNED. IF A SEAT BELT DOES NOT LOCK DURING A PANIC STOP FROM SUCH A HIGH RATE OF SPEED, WHY DO WE HAVE SEAT BELTS? ON JANUARY 31, 03 COMING HOME FROM THE ENGINEER INSPECTION, WE WERE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE INSPECTION. ALL WE WERE TOLD IS THAT THE SEAT BELT IS PERFORMING AS DESIGNED. WE, AT 45 MPH, DEPRESSED THE BRAKES AS LIKE WE WERE DOING A PANIC STOP, NEITHER DRIVER'S SIDE NOR PASSENGER SIDE SEAT BELT LOCKED. WILL STILL TEST THE ISSUE. SOME TIMES THE BELT WILL LOCK, SOMETIMES NOT. WE ARE CONCERNED AND FEEL WE HAVE HAD INFORMATION REGARDING THE SEAT BELTS AND OUR SAFETY CONCEALLED FROM US. VERY HARD TO WORK WITH THE DEALERSHIP.",
