THE FAILURE OCCURRED A NUMBER OF TIMES WHEN ROLLING THROUGH A YIELD SIGN WHILE IN SECOND GEAR. THE BIKE WAS UNDER ACCELERATION AFTER THE CORNER AND IT LOST SECOND GEAR WHILE ACCELERATING. AS THE BIKE REVS UP YOU ARE NO LONGER SAFELY ABLE TO SHIFT WITHOUT CAUSING MORE DAMAGE SO YOU TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND HOPE NO ONE IS COMING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. THE DEALER HAS IN FACT BEEN CONTACTED ALONG WITH SUZUKI AND THE ANSWER IS ALWAYS THE SAME... THERE ARE NO SERVICE BULLETINS OR SAFETY RECALLS REGARDING THIS ISSUE. THE DEALER CAN GET PARTS AT AN EXPENSE I WILL BE FORCED TO TAKE TO CONTINUE TO RIDE THE BIKE SAFELY. MAKE THE ROADS SAFER BY CORRECTING THE FAULTY PART.  *TR",
