IF THE OTHER VEHICLE HAD NOT BEEN A LARGE VAN I WOULD HAVE NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STOP THE CAR BECAUSE AT THAT POINT I LOST COMPLETE CONTROL OF MY VEHICLE.  JUST THINKING OF WHAT 'MIGHT HAVE BEEN' IS TERRIFYING!  IN SEARCHING THE INTERNET I FOUND AT LEAST FOUR OF THESE UNINTENDED ACCELERATION ACCOUNTS..... SAME CAR, SAME YEAR, SAME MODEL.  NO RECALL YET BUT THERE SHOULD BE.  DAMAGE IS EXPECTED TO BE AROUND $5K.",
