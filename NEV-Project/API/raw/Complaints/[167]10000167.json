        "summary": "FOUR KELLY SPRINGFIELD NAVIGATOR GOLD 108SXL WS WERE PURCHASED ON MAY 31, 2001 AT FLYNNS TIRE IN KENT, OHIO.    ON JULY 3, 2002 I HAD THE TIRES ROTATED AND THE FRONT END ALIGNMENT DONE.   ON JULY 15, 2002 I WAS TURNING A CORNER AND HEARD A POP AND THOUGHT I MAY HAVE STRUCK SOMETHING IN THE ROAD. I LOOKED BUT SAW NOTHING IN THE ROAD.  I WENT TO MY DESTINATION. WHEN I RETURNED TO MY VAN THE FRONT RIGHT TIRE WAS FLAT.  I CALLED A TOW TRUCK OUT TO FIX MY TIRE AND WHILE HE WAS RETRIEVING THE SPARE FROM UNDER THE VEHICLE HE TOLD ME THE REAR RIGHT TIRE WAS DAMAGED WITH A BUBBLE PROTRUDING FROM A TEAR IN THE SIDE WALL EXACTLY LIKE THE FRONT TIRE.  BOTH ON THE INSIDE OF THE TIRE NOT VISIBLE TO US.  I DROVE THE ONE MILE TO FLYNNS TIRES AND REPORTED THAT BOTH TIRES WERE DAMAGED  BUT HEARD A POP .  HE REMOVED THE TIRE FROM THE REAR AND MADE NO INDICATION THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM AND MY CHARGE WAS 98.79 FOR  TWO NEW TIRES. THE TIRES WERE RETAINED BY FLYNNS TIRES.  ON JULY 24,2002  WE TOOK A TRIP TO TENN. AND ON THE WAY HEARD A POP .IN TENN. WE FOUND THE REAR TIRE FLAT BUT STILL ONE OF THE ORIGINAL BECAUSE THE NEW TIRES WERE PLACED ON THE FRONT OF THE VAN. EVEN THOUGH I WAS NOT THERE I COULD DESCRIBE TO MY HUSBAND EXACTLY WHAT THE TIRE WOULD LOOK LIKE WHEN IT WAS REMOVED. THE TIRE WAS REMOVED AND THE SPARE PUT ON AND THE TIRE HAD THE FOUR INCH TEAR IN THE SIDEWALL WITH THE RUBBER BUBBLE PROTRUDING FROM IT.  WE HAD TO LOCATE A DEALER WHO SERVICED KELLY SPRINGFIELD IN TENN.  THE TECHNICIAN REPORTED TO MY HUSBAND THAT IT WAS TIRE FAILURE AND AFTER CONTACTING GOODYEAR/KELLY SPRINGFIELD THE TWO TIRES WERE REPLACED THAT REMAINED FROM THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE. THE COMPANY WOULD NOT GIVE ME FULL CREDIT FOR THE TIRES AND GAVE ME A TWO TIRES WITH LESS MILEAGE OVER THE LIFE OF THE TIRES. SO NOT ONLY DID I RECEIVE A DOWN GRADE IN THE TIRES BUT I HAD TO PAY ANOTHER 50.10 TOWARDS THE REPLACEMENT TIRES AND ALSO PAY FOR THE BALANCING OF THE TIRES. MY BILL WAS 98.68.  TS",
