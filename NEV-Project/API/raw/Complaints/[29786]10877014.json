HIDDEN POTHOLES BY STANDING WATER CAN CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO TRAVEL INTO AN INTERSECTION OR OTHER VEHICLE.  THIS IS THE THIRD 4-RUNNER THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  PREVIOUS VEHICLES WERE FROM 1994 AND 1998, AND I HAD THREE REAR-END ACCIDENTS, WHICH CAUSED MAJOR DAMAGE TO THE OTHER VEHICLES.",
