        "summary": "THE ABS/BRAKE LIGHT/ SLIP INIDICATOR WARNING TRIANGLE ON & OFF. MY 2010 TOYOTA PRIUS II HAS 153K MILE.  THIS HAS GONE ON/OFF FOR A FEW WEEKS NOW. THE BRAKE SEEMS TO LOOSE THE HYDRAULIC POWER BRAKE. I FEEL LIKE THE BRAKES HAVE FAILED A FEW TIMES WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHER SPEEDS. I HAVE TO PUMP BRAKE AND VEHICLE BEGINS TO BRAKE ON 2ND PUMP. I'VE HAD TO TRIPLE MY STOPPING DISTANCE AS TO NOT REAR ANYONE.   I WENT TO AUTOSHOP, THEY SAID IT'S THE BRAKE ACTUATOR/SENSORS THAT NEED TO BE REPLACED AND IT'S EXPENSIVE $2-3K. THEY SAID IT NEED TO BE FIX SOON BECAUSE BRAKE MIGHT FAIL AT ANY TIME. I CALLED CAMELBACK TOYOTA, PHOENIX, AZ, ED IN SERVICE DEPT SAID THERE IS NO SAFETY RECALL FOR THIS EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW IT HAS BEEN A COMMON PROBLEM WITH PRIUSES . I CHECKED VEHICLE REPAIR HISTORY LOOKS LIKE ABS PROGRAMMING WAS FLASHED BACK IN 2/11/2010,  WHEN VEHICLE WAS STILL ON THE MANUFACTURER, 3 MILES. I HAVE NOT FIXED YET. PLEASE RESEARCH THIS ISSUE FURTHER FOR SAFETY REASONS. I DO NOT WANT TO KILL ANYONE WHEN BRAKES WILL EVENTUALLY FAIL.",
