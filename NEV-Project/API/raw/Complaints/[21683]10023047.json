        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING MY 1999 FORD F250 DIESEL TRUCK AT 70 MPH (SPEED LIMIT) WHEN I TOUCHED THE BRAKE TO RELEASE THE CRUISE TO STOP AT THE TRAFFIC LIGHT UPON ENTERING PLAINS, TX.  THE CRUISE DID NOT RELEASE AND I BRAKED HARDER......THE ENGINE KEPT AT OVER 2,000 RPM AND DID NOT SLOW DOWN.....I BRAKED HARDER TO STOP AT THE LIGHT AND THE ENGINE NEVER SLOWED DOWN......I PUSHED THE OFF BUTTON ON THE CRUISE CONTROL AND PUMPED THE BRAKE AND IT NEVER SLOWED......I HAD TO BRAKE PRETTY HARD TO COME TO A STOP AT THE HIGHWAY INTERSECTION.....THE ENGINE WAS STILL RACING AT 2,000 RPM......I JERKED ACROSS THE INTERSECTION AND STOPPED THE TRUCK ON THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY BY TURNING OFF THE ENGINE.....WHEN I RESTARTED THE TRUCK, IT WOULD NOT GO FORWARD.  I HAD THE CAR HAULED TO THE NEAREST FORD DEALERSHIP, BROWNFIELD, TX.  THEY SAID IT SOUNDED LIKE AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM......THEN THEY TOLD ME IT WAS THE TRANSMISSION......THE TRUCK ONLY HAD 28,000 MILES ON IT......THEY REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION FOR $2,800.  AFTER TELLING MY FRIEND, A MECHANIC, THE PROBLEM HE SENT ME THIS MESSAGE:  GO TO: WWW.NHTSA.DOT.GOV/HOTLINE/  AND FILE A REPORT ON THE INCIDENT WITH THE TRUCK.  AFTER THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID HAPPENED, THERE MAY BE A PROBLEM WITH THE THROTTLE COMPONENTS.  IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN.  IF IT DOES , SHUT OFF THE IGNITION. TRYING TO HOLD THAT ENGINE WITH THE BRAKES (NOT SAYING IT DID) COULD BLOW THE TORQUE CONVERTER ON THE TRANSMISSION.  THE REASON FOR FILING THE REPORT IS THEY WILL INVESTIGATE FOR SAFETY AND THEY WILL ALSO LET YOU KNOW IF A SIMILAR REPORT HAS BEEN FILED.  TOM.   *NLM",
