I COULDN'T TELL YOU WHAT THEY DID AS FAR AS TAPING THE WIRES OR REPLACING THE SENSOR.  BUT I FEEL LIKE THEY DID NOTHING NOW THEY TELL ME THE PART IS 433.00 AND LABOR AND PROGRAMING IS ALMOST 1000.00.  I SEE MANY CARS HAVE THIS SAME ISSUE WITH THE PASSANGER PRESENCE SENSOR MODULE.  THE AIRBAG LIGHT ON KEEPS ME FROM GETTING THE CAR INSPECTED.  BASICALLY IF YOU SIT IN MY PASSANGER SIDE FRONT SEAT IT CAN'T  RECOGNIZE ANYONE SITTING THERE.  ANY HELP WOULD BE WELCOME ON THIS SITUATION.",
