TOOK TO DEALERSHIP - THEY ADJUSTED TRANSMISSION BUT SAID THEY CANNOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM SO I WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL IT GETS WORSE OR LEAVE IT UNTIL THEY EXPERIENCE THE PROBLEM.  NOW THE TRANSMISSION (AS OF 1 WEEK AGO) OCCASIONALLY \"SLAMS\" INTO FIRST AND SECOND GEAR.  I AM SCHEDULING ANOTHER SERVICE WITH THE DEALER.  I ADVISED THEM THE FAILURE TO SHIFT FROM REVERSE TO DRIVE IS A SAFETY HAZARD (I HAVE BEEN ALMOST REAR ENDED 3 TIMES IN A PARKING GARAGE).  THEY ARE NOT THE LEAST BIT CONCERNED.  I ASKED FOR A NEW REPLACEMENET CAR SINCE IT HAD 500 MILES ON IT AT THAT POINT - THEY WOULD NOT EVEN DISCUSS THIS. I AM NOT OPTIMISTIC AS THEY WILL LIKLEY GIVE ME THE \"WE CANNOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM - YOU WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL IT GETS WORSE\" ROUTINE. THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD. I WANT A NEW CAR OR A NEW TRANSMISSION.*AK",
