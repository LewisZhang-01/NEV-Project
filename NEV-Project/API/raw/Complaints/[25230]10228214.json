THE FUEL LEVEL WILL GRADUALLY GO BACK UP TO ABOUT 3/4 AND WILL DESCEND PROPERLY, BUT THEN SUBSEQUENT REFILLS CAUSE THE SAME PROBLEM.  DIAGNOSTIC CODE IS 0463. MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH NISSAN TRUCKS AND 4X4'S.    DEALERS WANT BETWEEN $450 - 600 DOLLARS TO REPLACE THIS!  SINCE IT IS PART OF FUELS SYSTEM LEVEL IT SHOULD BE COVERED AS EMISSIONS RELATED, RIGHT?  MY CAR WILL NOW NOT PASS THE EMISSIONS INSPECTION.  *TR",
