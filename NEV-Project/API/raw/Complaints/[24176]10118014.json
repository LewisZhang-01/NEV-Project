        "summary": "MY HUSBAND WAS BLINDED BY THE DRIVER AIRBAG ON A 1993 FORD CROWN VICTORIA IN SEPTEMBER 2002.  IT WAS A LOW IMPACT SINGLE CAR ACCIDENT AT 8 MPH.  THE AIRBAG DID NOT GO OFF IN A TIMELY MANNER AND BLINDED MY HUSBAND INSTANTLY.  MY HUSBAND SUFFERED A  TEAR IN THE LEFT MUSCLE AND PERMANENTLY LOST THE VISION IN THAT EYE, TORN IRIS ON BOTH EYES, BLOOD CLOTS IN BOTH EYES; CORNEA DAMAGE TO BOTH EYES... THE LIST IS LONG.  HE HAS HAD 8 EYE SURGERIES AND WE ARE STILL UNSURE OF HE WILL LOSE THE REST OF WHAT VISION HE HAS IN THE RIGHT EYE.    FORD HAS HAD MANY CASES SINCE THEN, BUT WILL STILL NOT RECALL THESE CARS FOR 1992-1996, WHICH INCLUDE THE GRAND MARQUIS.  FORD LOST A CASE IN 2000 (HOFFMAN V. FORD) AND ACCORDING TO AUTOMOTIVE NEWS:  FORD WAS AWARE OF AIRBAG COMPLAINTS THAT HAD BEEN MADE BY CONSUMERS, BUT FORD SAYS THEY DID NOTHING BECAUSE NO ONE EVER FILED A LAWSUIT.  SINCE THEY LOST THE HOFFMAN CASE, FORD STILL HAS NOT RECALLED THE CARS FOR THE DEFECTIVE AIRBAGS.  DURING A $1 BILLION COST SAVING BY FORD, THEY CHANGED THE AIRBAG SENSORS FROM 5 TO 3 SENSORS.  THIS SAVED FORD $18-25 PER CAR. THIS COST SAVING IS COSTING PEOPLE THEIR LIVES OR THEY ARE BEING BLINDED WHEN THE AIRBAG DOESN'T GO OFF WHEN IT SHOULD.  THE 1993 FORD CROWN VIC'S AIRBAG IS RELEASED INTO YOUR FACE AT .    WHEN ARE THE CONSUMERS AND JURIES GOING TO BE TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT THESE AIRBAGS AND THEIR DANGERS.  AIRBAGS MAY SAVE LIVES BUT THEY ALSO BURDEN A FAMILY WITH FINANCIAL RUIN, A LIFETIME OF MEDICAL BILLS AND EMOTIONAL DISTRESS AND FORD TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE RESULTS TO US CONSUMERS.  WE LOST OUT CASE AGAINST FORD.*AK",
