        "summary": "I USED A MIGHTY-TITE SEAT BELT TIGHTENER IN CONJUNCTION WITH MY CENTURY BRAVO CAR SEAT BECAUSE THE CAR SEAT KEPT SLIPPING WITH MY LAP BELT.  I INSTALLED THE MIGHTY-TITE IN A VERY TIGHT CAPACITY, BUT DOUBLE CHECKED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS NOT \"OVER-TIGHT,\" AS THE MANUFACTURER REQUESTED.  APPARENTLY IT WAS \"OVER-TIGHT,\" ALTHOUGH THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW WHAT \"OVER-TIGHT\" IS.  OVER TIME, THE MIGHTY-TITE BROKE THE ADJUSTABLE BASE OF MY CAR SEAT.  I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I WAS DRIVING WITH A BROKEN CAR BASE -- BUT CLEARLY, THIS WAS A DANGEROUS SITUATION.  I LEARNED THAT THE CAR BASE WAS BROKEN AFTER I REMOVED THE CAR SEAT TO TURN THE CAR SEAT AROUND FROM REAR FACING TO FORWARD FACING.  I THINK YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO THE MIGHTY-TITE PRODUCT (MADE BY SUNSHINE KIDS, WWW.SUNSHINEKIDSJP.COM 888-336-7909).  APPARENTLY IT CAN CAUSE A DANGEROUS SITUATION.  I CAREFULLY READ THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE MIGHTY-TITE AND THOUGHT I WAS INSTALLING IT CORRECTLY.  I AM A VERY INTELLIGENT WOMAN (I ATTENDED HARVARD UNIVERSITY).  IF I CAN MAKE THIS MISTAKE, AFTER CAREFULLY READING THE INSTRUCTIONS, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY ALSO MAKING THIS MISTAKE.  THANKS FOR LOOKING INTO THIS.",
