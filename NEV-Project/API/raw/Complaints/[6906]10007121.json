THIS IS OUR SECOND SET OF FRONT PADS. WE DO TOW HEAVY LOADS. THE SUBURBAN IS EQUIPPED WITH A HEAVY DUTY TOWING PACKAGE . IT HAS ALREADY HAD THE STEERING GEAR BOX REPLACED BY THE DEALER. THE FRONT PADS HAVE BEEN REPLACED ONCE AND THE REAR BRAKES HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED, ALSO THE MASTER CYLINDER HAS BEEN REPLACED BY THE DEALER.  THE BRAKES JUST DO NOT SEEM OF SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO STOP A VEHICLE OF THIS MASS TOWING LOAD.  WE'VE OWNED SUBURBAN'S SINCE 1973 SO WE DO FEEL WE HAVE A DEGREE OF EXPERIENCE IN THIS AREA.  FINALLY WHEN THE VEHICLE IS DRIVEN AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND A BUMP IS HIT, THE ENTIRE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM SHORTS OUT FOR APPROXIMATELY 1/6-1/5 OF A SECOND CAUSING EVERYTHING TO GO DARK. I SUSPECT AN EXPOSURE IN A WIRING HARNESS.  *JB    *****DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS****763731",
