SUPPOSEDLY THEY REPLACED THE ENGINE ON THE THIRD SERVICE TIME, BUT WITHIN 4 DAYS THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY. I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THIS CAR. EACH TIME I TAKE IT TO THE DEALER FOR SERVICE THEY INSIST THE PROBLEM IS FIXED, YET THE SAME THING  KEEPS HAPPENING, THE ENGINE SHUTS OFF FOR NO REASON.  THE DEALER HAS TOLD ME THEY DO NOT KNOW WHY THIS IS HAPPENING AND SUPPOSEDLY THEY TAKE IT FOR A TEST DRIVE AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR THEM.  *NLM",
