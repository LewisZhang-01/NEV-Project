        "summary": "I OWN A 2000 GMC YUKON XL.  OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, I HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLE CONTINUALLY BLOWING A FUSE (ECM B FUSE).  UPON MY OWN RESEARCH INTO THE CIRCUITRY, I DETERMINED THE LIKELY PROBLEM WAS THE FUEL PUMP.  I REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP AND UPON REMOVING AND INSPECTING THE OLD COMPONENT, I DISCOVERED THE HOT WIRE (GRAY WIRE) WHICH OPERATES THE PUMP MOTOR HAD BEEN HOT ENOUGH TO MELT THE INSULATION OFF THE WIRE.  MOREOVER, THIS HOT WIRE HAD MELTED INTO ONE OF THE WIRES OF THE FUEL LEVEL SENDING UNIT, WHICH IS A GROUND CIRCUIT.  THE PROBLEM I WOULD LIKE TO BRING TO LIGHT HERE IS THAT THE FUEL PUMP UNIT IS INSIDE THE FUEL TANK.  WHEN THIS HOT WIRE CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE OTHER WIRE, I ASSUME THERE WAS A SPARK, OR THE POTENTIAL FOR ONE.  WHY DIDN'T MY VEHICLE EXPLODE?  I KNOW THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THESE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD, BUT I HAVE NOT HEARD OF ANY SUCH EXPLOSIONS.  I DO KNOW OF ANOTHER GM VEHICLE THAT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM OF EXPOSED WIRES IN THE FUEL TANK.   PLEASE ADVISE ME OF THE DANGER LEVEL SHOULD THIS HAPPEN AGAIN.   THANK YOU.    *NLM",
