BECAUSE IT GETS SO HOT AND SITS SO CLOSE TO THE REAR TIRE I FEAR THAT THERE WILL BE A FIRE. IN FACT, I HAVE NOTICED LEAVES AND GRASS CATCH FIRE FROM NORMAL RIDING BUT THEY BURNED OFF WITHOUT CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE PLASTIC. THE PLASTIC GETS SO HOT IT WILL SOFTEN AND BEND EASILY TO THE TOUCH. THE STICK ON HEAT SHIELD UNDER THE FENDER GETS SO HOT, IT LOST ITS STICKYNESS AND IS NOW FALLING OFF. IT ALSO GOT SO HOT THAT THE ALUMINUM HEAT SHIELD AROUND THE EXHAUST IS COMING APART AT THE FACTORY CRIMP POINTS.",
