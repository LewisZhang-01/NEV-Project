AFTER LOOKING INTO IT I HAVE FOUND THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH GM CARS AND TRUCKS WITH A 3.4L ENGINE. THERE SEEMS TO BE A FAULTY DESIGN TO THE GASKET. I HAVE TAKEN CARE OF THIS VAN DOING ALL MAINTENANCE ON SCHEDULE. GM WILL DO NOTHING TO FIX THIS PROBLEM EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF THIS HAPPENING. THEY HAVE EVEN ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN TO DEALERS ON HOW TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM QUICKLY (TSB#02-06-01-014). WHEN THE GASKET GOES THERE IS A LOSS OF POWER IN THE ENGINE OR STALLING MAKING IT HARD TO STEER AND BREAK.            *JB",
