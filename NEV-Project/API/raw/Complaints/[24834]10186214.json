WAS JUST DRIVING AT POSTED SPEED LIMITS IN A COMMUNITY AREA OF PHOENIX, WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A LOUD CLACKING NOISE STARTED AS I PULLED UP TO MY DESIGNATION, SO I TURNED OFF THE MOTOR, LIFTED THE HOOD AND IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THAT THE TENSION PULLEY HAD NEARLY COMPLETELY CAME OFF THE MOTOR.  IT DID CAUSE THE SERPINTINE BELT TO COME OFF OF ALL THE PULLIES OF THE MOTOR.  I HAD TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED HOME, AGAIN FOR THE SECOND TIME SINCE SEPT. 2006.  HEN THE VEHICLE WAS AT MY HOME I FINISHED REMOVING THE PULLEY THAT  WAS LOOSE,  CAUSING IT TO BENT  ENOUGH TO THROW IT TOTALLY OFF OF ITS TENSION PURPOSE.  UPON REMOVAL A BOLT WAS ALSO BROKEN WHICH MAY HAVE CAUSED THE TOTAL PROBLEM BECAUSE IT WAS NOT TIGHTENED TO TORQUE SPECS.  HAD TO REPLACE BOTH PARTS ATTACHED TO THIS PULLEY.*AK",
