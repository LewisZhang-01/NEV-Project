        "summary": "IT ALL BEGAN WHEN WE PURCHASED A BRAND NEW 1996 DODGE STRATUS IN OCT 1995. THE CAR GAVE US LITTLE IF ANY TROUBLE THE FIRST YEAR. THE SECOND YEAR AND EVERY YEAR SINCE IT HAS BEEN A#1 HEADACHE. THE SECOND YEAR ALONE THE CAR WAS IN THE SHOP 17 TIMES. THE REPAIRS WERE MAJOR ONES AS WELL AS MINOR ONES INCLUDING REPLACEMENT OF AIR COMPRESSOR ON AIR CONDITIONER, STARTER, REPLACEMENT OF HEAD GASKET TWICE ONCE AT 11565 MILES SECOND AT 20495 MILES AND GUESS WHAT NOW AT 69000 MILES.THANK GOODNESS THE FIRST TWO WERE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. I FILED A COMPLAINT WITHIN THE WARRANTY PERIOD WITH  THE DEALERSHIP, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AS WELL AS GOOD OLD CHRYSLER. I WAS TOLD BY CHRYSLER I COULD ALWAYS BUY AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ANFD THEY WOULD OPEN A COMPLAINT FILE ON ME SO THAT IF ANY OF THE SAME PROBLEMS OCCURED, I COULD CONTACT THEM. WELL I HAVE CONTACTED THEM BUT THEY SAY THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING. TALK ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE HUH!!!!!  I AM NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT ANSWER. I THINK CHRYSLER HAS TO ADMIT THERE IS A PROBLEM AND CORRECT THIS AT NO COST. THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM I AM",
