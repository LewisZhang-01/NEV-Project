THE FIRST TIME I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT RECREATE THE PROBLEM. I TOOK IT IN YESTERDAY AND ONE BULB WAS REPLACED FOR $275. I UNDERSTAND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT DRIVING  AT NIGHT, BECAUSE BOTH LIGHTS HAVE GONE OFF AT SAME TIME. *TR",
