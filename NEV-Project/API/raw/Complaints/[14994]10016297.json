MY FATHER HAS A 2001 AND ALSO HAD TO REPLACE HIS FRONT AND REAR ROTORS. I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A CONTINUAL PROBLEM FOR JEEP AND THAT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED MORE THOROUGHLY. IF A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED FOR JEEP OWNERS I AM SURE A PREVALENT NUMBER OF OWNERS WOULD SHARE THIS COMPLAINT. TO ALLOW THIS FACTOR TO EXIST IN SUCH A POPULAR VEHICLE IS A DANGER TO THE CONSUMER AND ANY ONE WHO SHARES THE ROAD.   *NLM",
