THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE NEVER WENT PAST NORMAL AND INTO THE RED, DURING THIS TIME, NO HEAT WOULD BLOW. THEN THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE WOULD DROP AND WARM AIR WOULD BLOW. I CHANGED THE THERMOSTAT, TEMPERATURE SENSOR, AND THE RADIATOR( WHICH SOLVED THE PROBLEM FOR ABOUT TWO DAYS). NOTHING LEFT BUT THE HEAD GASKETS AND MAYBE EVEN A CRACKED HEAD.  WASN'T THERE A RECALL FOR WINDSTAR'S WITH THE SAME ENGINE?  THIS IS MY SECOND ENGINE FROM FORD, THE FIRST ONE GAVE OUT AROUND 36,000 MILES. WHEN WILL AMERICAN CAR COMPANIES BUILT RELIABLE ENGINES?  NO WONDER THE FOREIGN CAR COMPANIES DO WELL IN AMERICA!  *JB",
