THE RIGHT-HAND CORNER OF THE SUN VISOR, WHEN IN ITS FULLEST POSITION (NOT AT AN ANGLE), OBSCURES NEARLY HALF OF THE REARVIEW MIRROR. THIS HAS CAUSED A NUMBER OF \"NEAR ACCIDENT\" EVENTS.  2. THE HONDA IS DESIGNED TO DOWNSHIFT WHEN GOING DOWNHILL. NOT ONLY DOES THIS DIMINISH GAS EFFICIENCY, BUT CAN CAUSE SKIDS IN ICY WEATHER.  3. THE BRAKES ARE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE.  I HAVE SPOKEN TO TWO AREA HONDA SERVICE CENTERS AND A SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE AT HONDA HEADQUARTER. THE AREA MANAGERS SAY THAT \"THEY'RE ALL LIKE THAT; THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO,\" AND THE HONDA HEADQUARTERS REP SAYS THE SAME. SHE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO RECOMMEND I GET THE LOWER HALF OF MY WINDSHIELD TINTED TO PREVENT SUN GLARE! WHAT ABOUT NIGHT DRIVING?  I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM CANNOT BE FOUND. CAN YOU HELP IN ANY WAY?   *NM",
