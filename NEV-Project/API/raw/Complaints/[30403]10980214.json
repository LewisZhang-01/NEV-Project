SOMETIMES THE DASH LIGHTS GO OUT WHEN THE HEADLIGHTS ARE TURNED ON AND THEN THE DASH LIGHTS COME BACK ON WHEN THE HEADLIGHTS ARE TURNED OFF.  SOMETIMES THE DASH LIGHTS COME BACK ON EVEN WITH THE HEADLIGHTS ARE ON BUT THE DASH LIGHTS ARE VERY DIM.  IT IS BECOMING MORE DANGEROUS TO DRIVE WHEN YOU CAN'T COUNT ON THE DASH LIGHTS OR TURN SIGNALS WORKING.  FORD HAS TOLD ME THERE IS NO RECALL FOR THIS YEAR HAVING A BAD LIGHT CONTROL MODULE.  THERE WAS A RECALL FOR CROWN VICTORIA YEARS 2003 THROUGH 2005.  MY CAR HAS 111,566 MILES.",
