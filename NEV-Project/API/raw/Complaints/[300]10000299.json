DID NOT SHUT OFF WHEN I TURNED THE KEY OFF. HAD TO PULL 60 AMP ABS FUSE TO STOP PUMP FROM RUNNING MY BATTERY DOWN. THIS TRUCK HAS ONLY 38,000 MILES ON IT. I HAVE READ ABOUT SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME FAILURE AT LOW MILEAGE. THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE PART TO REPLACE, AND IT SHOULD LAST A LOT LONGER. I WOULD LIKE CHEVROLET TO COVER THE COST OF THE REPLACEMENT MODULE.  TS",
