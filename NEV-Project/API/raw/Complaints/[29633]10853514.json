I AM NOT COMFORTABLE DRIVING MY CAR KNOWING THERE IS A RISK OF SERIOUS DAMAGE OR DEATH IF THE BAG DEPLOYS.  I TAKE XARELTO (BLOOD THINNER) AND PURCHASED THIS SUV TO FEEL SAFER WHEN DRIVING.  I AM A REALTOR AND USE MY CAR EVERYDAY AND OFTEN TIMES WITH CLIENTS OF MINE IN THE CAR.  THE DEALERSHIP STATED THEY ARE NOT SELLING ANYMORE OF THESE CARS WITH THE DEFECTS UNTIL THEY ARE CORRECTED YET I AM DRIVING ONE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED.  THEY STATED THEY WILL GIVE ME A $35 A DAY ALLOWANCE TO RENT BUT AGAIN THAT WILL ONLY GET ME A COMPACT CAR AND NOTHING CLOSE TO A COMPARABLE.  WHY AM I SPENDING $1009 A MONTH FOR MY X5 TO DIVE A FORD FOCUS.  IT MAKES NO SENSE.  I WOULD LIKE A REMEDY TO MY SITUATION IMMEDIATELY.  THIS ISSUE IS/WILL IMPACT MY BUSINESS IF I CAN NOT DRIVE MY CAR.  IF I DON'T GET A RESOLUTION I WILL GET MY ATTORNEY INVOLVED.",
