FLUID IS REPLACED EVERY FALL, AS THE STEERING PUMP HAS BEEN A NOISY ONE SINCE THE TRUCK WAS NEW. DEALER SUGGESTED REPLACING FLUID WITH SYNTHETIC. IT WORKED THEN, SO I REPLACE IT EVERY YEAR. TODAY, WITH STEERING AT FULL LEFT LOCK, THE STEERING WAS STUCK AT THAT POINT. MOVED WHEEL BACK AND FORTH AND IT CAME LOOSE. HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DUPLICATE SINCE. AS A NOTE AT 5 YEARS OLD AND 53,000 MILES POWER STEERING PRESSURE HOSE SPRUNG A LEAK UNDER THE CLAMP AT THE FRAME. REPLACED WITH AFTER MARKET PART, AS DEALER COULDN'T GET THE PART. BACK ORDERED!",
