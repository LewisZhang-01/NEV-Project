        "summary": "WE WERE DRIVING THE VEHICLE ON INTERSTATE HIGHWAY AT 70 MPH.  CAR BEGAN BUCKING, HAD A HIGH PITCHED WHINING AND LOST ALL POWER IN ACCELERATION,  TRANSMISSION WENT OUT.  WE IMMEDIATELY DROPPED TO 20 MPH. WE WERE ALMOST REAR-ENDED IN TRAFFIC. HAD TO MOVE TO SHOULDER AND HAVE CAR TOWED.  DEALERSHIP GAVE US 800 NUMBER TO CALL NISSAN SINCE THE 2008-2010 MODELS HAVE HAD THE SAME TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS.  NISSAN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THOSE BUT REFUSED TO EXTEND WARRANTY ON 2011 WHICH HAS THE SAME TRANSMISSION.  THE CAR GAVE NO WARNING AT ALL.  THIS PROBLEM COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. NISSAN NEEDS TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. JUST READ ON EDMUNDS.COM FORUM THAT MANY NISSAN ROGUE OWNERS ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH TRANSMISSION WHILE DRIVING WITHOUT ANY WARNING.  *TR",
