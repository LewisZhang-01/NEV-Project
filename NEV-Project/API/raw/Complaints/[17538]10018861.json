WHILE DRIVING, A PERSON CANNOT FEEL WITH HIS/HER FINGERS THE DIFFERENCE IN TEXTURE ON THE WHEEL FROM WHERE THE HORN IS LOCATED AND WHERE IT IS NOT.  ONCE IT IS FOUND, THE PLASTIC IS SO DIFFICULT TO DEPRESS THAT AN INDIVIDUAL MUST APPLY AN EXTREME AMOUNT OF PRESSURE WITH THEIR ENTIRE FIST FOR THE HORN TO GO OFF, AND FINALLY, THE AREA TO ACTIVATE THE HORN IS SO SMALL IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND, I ESTIMATE IT IS SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN THE NAIL ON MY THUMB...AND I HAVE VERY AVERAGE SIZE HANDS FOR A MAN.  THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS HORN ASSEMBLY, AS A RESULT, IT IS USELESS IN REAL LIFE DRIVING SITUATIONS.  *JB",
