THE DRIVER'S DOOR AND TAILGATE ONLY WILL LOCK WITH REMOTE, INSIDE DOOR LOCK BUTTON OR THE SENSOR SWITCH ON FRONT DOOR HANDLES.  THE OTHER 3 DOORS (PASSENGER FRONT AND TWO READ DOORS DO NOT LOCK.  THEY ALL UNLOCK JUST FINE.  THIS IS INTERMITTENT AND ACCORDING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH THIS ISSUE, ONLY A BCM REPLACEMENT WILL SOLVE IT.  WHEN THESE LOCKS ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY, THE CHILD SAFETY LOCKS AND THE SPEED SENSING LOCKING SYSTEM DO NOT FUNCTION.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE.",
