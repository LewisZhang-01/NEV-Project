WHENEVER SHE ATTEMPTS TO ADD FUEL TO THE VEHICLE, IT WILL NOT TAKE MORE THAN FIVE GALLONS, AND THE DIAL NEVER INDICATES THAT IT IS MORE THEN 3/4 FULL.  ALSO, THE DIAL WILL MOVE FROM HALF A TANK DOWN TO EMPTY WITHIN 60 MILES.  THE CONTACT TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER MORE THAN SIX TIMES AND THEY REPLACED THE LEVEL KIT SENSOR, WHICH DID NOT REPAIR THE FAILURE.  WITHIN WEEKS, THE DEALER REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP MODULE, WHICH ALSO DID NOT REPAIR THE FAILURE.  A MONTH LATER THEY REPAIRED THE FULL TANK HOSES, BUT THE FAILURE PERSISTED.  A YEAR LATER, THE FUEL PUMP MODULE WAS REPLACED ONCE AGAIN.  AFTER ALL OF THESE REPAIRS, THE FAILURE HAS NOT YET BEEN PROPERLY CORRECTED.  THE FAILURE IS CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO STALL WHILE DRIVING 15 MPH.  THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 61,000 AND CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 84,000.",
