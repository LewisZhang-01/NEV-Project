AFTER WORK IN MID APRIL OF 2019, I RETURNED TO MY PARKED CAR. UNLOCKED AND ENTERED THE VEHICLE FROM THE DRIVER'S SIDE. I LOWERED THE SUN SHADE AND NOTICED A LARGE CRACK IN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD. IT STARTED AT THE BOTTOM EDGE OF THE GLASS ON THE DRIVER SIDE, ARCED UP AND CURVED TOWARDS THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR. NO OTHER DAMAGE WAS NOTICED INSIDE. I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND CHECKED IT FOR ANY ADDITIONAL DAMAGE AND CHECKED THE WINDSHIELD FROM THE OUTSIDE. THERE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY OTHER DAMAGE THAN THE CRACKED WINDSHIELD AND A MINISCULE LEFT PASSENGER DOOR DING. AS IF THE EDGE OF ANOTHER CAR DOOR CAME IN CONTACT WITH MY SUBARU. NO ROAD HAZARDS OR DEBRIS WAS ENCOUNTERED ON THE WAY TO OR FROM WORK. I NOTIFIED THE DEALERSHIP, HILEY SUBARU OF FORT WORTH, AND REQUESTED TO HAVE THE WINDSHIELD REPLACED DURING MY NEXT SERVICE APPOINTMENT INDICATING THIS WAS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT UNDER WARRANTY. AT THE SERVICE APPOINTMENT, THEY DECLINED TO REPLACE THE WINDSHIELD UNDER WARRANTY.",
