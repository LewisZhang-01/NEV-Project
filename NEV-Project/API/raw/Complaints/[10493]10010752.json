DEALER HAS SEEN CAR TODAY AND SAID IT CANNOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM SO THEY HAVE NOTHING TO FIX. MY CAR HAS BEEN IN CLOSE TO A DOZEN TIMES IN REGARDS TO THE ROUGH HANDLING. ESPECIALLY WHEN A/C WAS ON. NOW IT SEEMS TO HAVE A PROBLEM WHILE COMING TO A STOP AT A LIGHT...WHEN YOU TRY TO GO THE CAR SEEMS LIKE IT ISN'T GETTING GAS. CAR DEALER IS UNABLE TO DUPLICATE ALTHOUGH MY HUSBAND AND FRIENDS HAVE ALL NOTICED/EXPERIENCED THE ROUGH FEELING WHILE DRIVING (LIKE IT WILL JUST STALL OUT...SORT OF SPUTTERS) I AM VERY AGGRAVATED WITH MY '01 NEON.   *NLM",
