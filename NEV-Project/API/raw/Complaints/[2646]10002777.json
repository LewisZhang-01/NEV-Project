I APOLOGIZE FOR ASKING NOW THREE [3] TIMES IN WRITING [AND SEVERAL MORE TIMES ORALLY] WHY A VEHICLE WITH 2503 MILES WOULD HAVE THE THROTTLE BODY STICK AND HAVE A CARBON BUILD UP IN THE INTAKE SYSTEM, AND AT 3102 MILES HAVE THE VEHICLE DIAGNOSED AS HAVING THE THROTTLE BODY STUCK CLOSED.  [CAN YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WOULD IMPAIR MY ENJOYMENT OF THE VEHICLE?  AND AS THESE PROBLEMS ARE CONSISTENT WITH MY EVERYDAY EXPERIENCES IN THE VEHICLE, CAN YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IMPAIRS MY USE OF THE VEHICLE?] .    I APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING TO INFORM YOU YET AGAIN THAT MY VEHICLE PERIODICALLY UNLOCKS ITSELF AND SIMULTANEOUSLY DISENGAGES ITS ALARM.  YES, I KNOW THAT YOUR ''INDEPENDENT APPRAISER'' DISAGREES, YET, OF COURSE, THIS WAS ANOTHER ITEM THAT HE FAILED TO CHECK WITH ME ON AND THEREBY DID NOT TEST FOR APPROPRIATELY DURING HIS 12.7 MILE JOY RIDE.  YET I DO NOT FAULT HIM; YOU SEE, IT TAKES COMMITMENT TO CUSTOMERS, COMMITMENT TO CARING IN ORDER TO ASSESS A PROBLEM OF THIS NATURE SINCE IT IS INTERMITTENT.  HE OWES ME NOTHING.  DON''T GET ME WRONG, I KNOW HYUNDAI OWES ME EVEN LESS; I''M JUST LOST IN A UTOPIAN DREAM.  BY WAY OF A COPY OF THIS LETTER, I AM INFORMING MY INSURANCE CARRIER THAT NEITHER YOU NOR I [SINCE I DON''T HAVE THE MEANS] CAN ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM.  WHEN MY VEHICLE GETS STOLEN, THEY CAN EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT OF SUBROGATION AND YOU CAN FIGHT IT OUT WITH AN ENTITY THAT HAS DEEP POCKETS INSTEAD OF HAVING YOUR TIME WASTED BY THE LITTLE PEOPLE.  OF COURSE IT IS A SHAME THAT I LOSE THE RIGHT TO HAVE PEACE OF MIND IN DRIVING AND PARKING MY OWN VEHICLE BUT WHAT''S THE LOSS OF A FEW PERSONAL POSSESSIONS AMONG FRIENDS!  I GUESS YOU HAVE TO PAY UPWARD OF $30,000 FOR THAT PRIVILEGE.",
