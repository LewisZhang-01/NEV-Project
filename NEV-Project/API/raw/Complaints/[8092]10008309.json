STEERING WHEEL SHAKES SO HARD NOW THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL CAR.  FIRST STARTED TO NOTICE PROBLEM JUST OVER 12,000 MILES WHEN WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED.  JUDGING FROM OTHER COMPLAINTS AS WELL AS TSB  BULLETINS, THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH JEEPS.  WHY ISN'T THERE A RECALL, OR WHY DOESN'T CHRYSLER REPLACE ROTORS FOR FREE AS THIS SEEMS TO BE A DESIGN FLAW? *JB",
