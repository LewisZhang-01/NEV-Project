SEVERAL DAYS LATER WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY THE CAR SUDDENLY BEGAN TO SLOW BETWEEN 30-40 MILES AN HOUR. IN ORDER TO GET HOME WE HAD TO TURN OFF THE CAR AND THEN RESTART AND COAST. IN AN EFFORT TO TRANSPORT TO OUR MECHANIC THE CAR WOULD NOT GO IN REVERSE AND WOULD NOT GO INTO DRIVE SO WE HAD TO TOW IT IN NEUTRAL TO THE SHOP. THE MECHANIC WAS ABLE TO VERIFY HOW THE TRANSMISSION FLUID WAS BLACK AND SMELLED BURNT. HIS PROGNOSIS WAS THAT I WILL NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION. WITHIN THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS I HAD THE CAR IN THE SHOP BECAUSE OF ENGINE NOISE. IT WAS THOUGHT TO BE THE TRANSMISSION AND FURTHER DIAGNOSTICS REVEALED THE IDLER TENSIONER PULLEYS HAD TO BE REPLACED. AT THE TIME COMPUTER DIAGNOSTICS REVEALED NO PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSMISSION AND THE FLUID WAS FINE AS WELL.  *TR",
