        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING MY 2006 CHEVROLET HHR LS TRAVELING AT BETWEEN 25-30 MPH THE DRIVER INFORMATION CENTER DISPLAY FLASHED \"REDUCED ENGINE POWER\" FOR ABOUT FIVE SECONDS AND THEN CHANGED TO \"ENGINE DISABLED\" AND IMMEDIATELY SHUT THE CAR DOWN WHILE I WAS DRIVING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. I TRIED TO RESTART THE ENGINE AND IT WOULD NOT INITIALLY START. AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES THE CAR DID START AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON. I PROCEEDED IMMEDIATELY TO MY SERVICE STATION WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND THE CHECK ENGINE CODE AS \"PCM MEMORY ERROR\" THEY SAID THE CODE WAS SOMETHING THEY HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND DECIDED THAT IT WAS BEST TO CLEAR THE CODE AND SEE IF THE PROBLEM REPEATED ITSELF. I THEN TOOK THE CAR FOR SHORT DRIVE AND AGAIN THE CAR FLASHED THE SAME TWO MESSAGES ON THE DIC AND THEN STALLED BUT THIS TIME IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROTARY. I WAS ABLE TO PUSH THE CAR OFF TO THE SIDE AND WAITED SEVERAL MINUTES AGAIN BEFORE THE CAR WOULD RESTART. THIS TIME AT THE SERVICE STATION THEY DECIDED IT WOULD BE BEST IF I TOOK IT TO AN ACTUAL CHEVROLET GARAGE SINCE THEY HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH AN OBD-II ERROR CODE. THIS TIME HOWEVER AFTER CLEARING THE CODE IT WOULD NOT DRIVE MORE THAN A FEW YARDS BEFORE STALLING OUT. SO, THE DECISION WAS MADE TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED AFTER HAVE THE CAR FOR A FEW DAYS THEY DECIDED THAT IT WAS BEST TO REPLACE THE PCM SINCE THAT SEEMED TO BE WHAT WAS CAUSING THE ERROR. THE WAY THE CAR BEHAVED WITH THIS PCM ERROR I FELT WAS VERY DANGEROUS SO I CONTACTED CHEVROLET CUSTOMER SUPPORT ON JULY 21, 2008. THE CASE NUMBER IS 71-646640348 WITH CHEVROLET. THE INITIAL CONTACT PERSON WAS UNABLE TO ANSWER MY CONCERNS. LATER THAT AFTERNOON I WAS CALLED BY ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL ABOUT THE ISSUE AND THE OPINION THAT I GOT FROM HER WAS THAT \"I SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT, GM WAS REPAIRING THE CAR FOR FREE UNDER THE EPA MANDATED WARRANTY\" SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT MY CONCERN WAS NOT THAT THE CAR DID HAVE A PART FAIL BUT HOW IT BEHAVED WHEN SUCH A MINOR PIECE OF EQUIPMENT DID FAIL.  *TR",
