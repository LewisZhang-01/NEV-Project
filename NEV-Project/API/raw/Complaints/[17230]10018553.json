I WENT TO THE DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME THAT ALL THE TRUCKS THEY SELL DO THE SAME THING AND IT WAS JUST ROAD CONDITIONS. I FILED A CLAIM WITH DODGE AND THEY TOLD ME TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH THE DEALERSHIP.  I TALKED WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER (DALE SPONSELLER) AT THE DEALERSHIP AND HE SAID THAT HE FELT THE VIOLENT VIBRATIONS AND WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE RIDE OF THE TRUCK, BUT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT HE COULD DO TO REPAIR IT.   *NLM",
