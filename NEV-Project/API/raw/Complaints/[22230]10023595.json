I WAS ENTERING A 6 LANE HIGHWAY WHEN THIS HAPPENED.  IT WAS MY DRIVER SIDE FRONT DOOR.  MY HUSBAND HAS HAD THIS HAPPEN ON HIS JETTA AS WELL.  WE DON'T RECOMMEND JETTA'S OR VW FOR THAT MATTER FOR ANYTHING.  WE HAVEN'T EVEN OWNED OUR CARS FOR A YEAR AND WE PURCHASED THEM ON THE SAME DAY.  THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE SHOP FOR REPAIRS BETWEEN THE BOTH OF THEM 6 TIMES! 3 EACH CAR!  THIS IS RIDICULOUS FOR NEW CARS AND THE WINDOWS ARE NOT SAFE IF YOU ASK ME.  ACCORDING TO VW TECHNICIANS, IT IS A KNOWN ISSUE, BUT WON'T BE REPLACED UNTIL THEY BREAK.  THESE WINDOWS FALLING INSIDE THE DOOR LIKE THEY DO IS A HAZARD.  IF YOU ARE DRIVING IN THE RAIN OR EVEN A NICE DAY, IT IS DISTRACTING AND NOT SAFE.    *NLM",
