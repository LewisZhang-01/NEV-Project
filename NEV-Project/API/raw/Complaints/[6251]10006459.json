THIS PROBLEM HAS ALSO SHOWN UP ON OUR OTHER VEHICLE OF SAME YR.MK. MODEL. DEALER OFFERED TO CORRECT PROBLEM BY INSTALLING A METAL VALVE STEM. UNDER WARRANTY, I FEEL THEY SHOULD BE DOING A RECALL TO CHECK OTHER VEHICLE'S OF SAME YR.MK.MODEL. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS POTENTIAL PROBLEM. I HATE TO THINK FORD WOULD WANT ANY MORE TIRE/WHEEL LAWSUITS IN THE FUTURE.
