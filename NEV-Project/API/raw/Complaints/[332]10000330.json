FORD DEALER REMOVED HEAD, INSTALLED SPARK PLUG INSERT AND CHARGED ME $1700.00  .    I BELIEVE SPARK PLUGS SHOULD NEVER BLOW OUT OF CYLINDER HEAD WHEN INSTALLED BY A FORD TRAINED MECHANIC. THE SPARK PLUG FORD USES HAS ONLY 6 THREADS ON IT. THAT IS NOT ENOUGH THREADS FOR A ALUMINUM HEAD. THIS IS A ENGINE DESIGN ERROR.TS",
