        "summary": "2004 TOYOTA TUNDRA DOUBLE CAB HAD SEVERE RUSTING WHICH CAUSED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE CABLE AND PIN ATTACHMENTS TO  BREAK.  WHEN THE DEALER FIXED THE BRAKE, I WAS TOLD THAT THE PROBLEM WAS CAUSED BY VERY RUSTED PARTS WHICH THEN LED ME TO DISCOVER THAT THE ENTIRE FRAME OF THE TRUCK IS HEAVILY RUSTED.  DEALER CALLED IT FLAKING.  I CONTACTED TOYOTA AND THE DEALER WAS INSTRUCTED TO INSPECT THE TRUCK AND SEND RESULTS TO TOYOTA.  THEY NOW CALL IT SURFACE RUST.  I ASKED THE DEALER TO PUT IN WRITING THAT THE TRUCK WAS SAFE BUT THEY DID NOT.  I AM NOW CONCERNED THAT WITH THE FRAME, BOLTS, NUTS AND JOINTS SO RUSTY IT WILL SOON BECOME A SAFETY ISSUE.  I HAVE LOOKED AT OTHER TUNDRA'S THE SAME AGE AND THE UNDERCARRIAGE APPEARS TO HAVE AN UNDERCOATING THAT I DO NOT.  I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER THAT TOYOTA HAS GIVEN ME WHICH STATES THAT IT IS ONLY SURFACE RUST. *TR",
