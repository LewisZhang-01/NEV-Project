THIS COULD CAUSE MANY DEATHS. I ALSO FEEL THAT YOU SHOULD  REPLACE THEM WITH THE GEN 4 SEAT BELTS FOR FREE. HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOUR KIDS WERE IN THE CAR AND THEY GOT HURT? I BET YOU WOULDN'T LIKE THAT.  IF IT WAS  YOUR CAR WITH YOUR KIDS, YOU WOULD HAVE IT REPLACED.        *JB    P.S.         I SAW THIS ON THE TV THERE WAS NO INCIDENT DATE.",
