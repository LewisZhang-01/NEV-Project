DEALER HAS REPLACED WITH EXACT SAME HOSE, SAYS THAT IS WHAT CHRYSLER TELLS THEM TO REPLACE IT WITH. DEALER ADMITS THERE IS ABOUT 30 HOSES REPLACED EACH WEEK IN COLD WEATHER. ALSO STATED THAT ALL THAT MAY BE NEEDED IS A STRONGER/BETTER HOSE. NO RECALL HAS BEEN MADE. I HAVE THREE YOUNG CHILDREN THAT I TRANSPORT DAILY. AND I AM CONCERNED FOR THEIR WELFARE. I ALSO TRAVEL OVER 60 MILES TO WORK EACH DAY ON THE INTERSTATE. IF THE POWER STEERING GOES WHILE I AM ON THE INTERSTATE IT COULD CAUSE A HORRIFIC ACCIDENT EVEN RESULTING IN DEATH. IT SHOULDN'T TAKE THAT TYPE OF SITUATION BEFORE A RECALL IS MADE. IF THE HOSE GOES AGAIN, I WILL BE GOING THROUGH LEMON LAW PROCEEDINGS.*JB",
