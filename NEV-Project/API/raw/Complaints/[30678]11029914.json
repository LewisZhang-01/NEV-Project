IT CAN NOT BE CERTAIN THAT THE TESLA VERSION OF EVENTS IS CORRECT.  IT IS REMARKABLE THAT IN EVERY CRASH INVOLVING A TESLA THE COMPANY CLAIMS THE LOGS PROVE IT WAS THE FAULT OF THE OWNER.  EVEN IF THE CARS LOGS DID GENUINELY SHOW THAT A SIGNAL FROM A REMOTE CAUSED THE OPENING IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A FAULT IN THE KEY-FOB WAS RESPONSIBLE.  TESLA KEY-FOB BATTERIES FAIL OFTEN. LOW BATTERIES IN ELECTRONIC DEVICES CAN CAUSE SPURIOUS FAULTS.  TESLA HAS ONLY RECENTLY UPDATED THE SOFTWARE TO ALLOW REMOTE DOOR OPENING.  I BELIEVE THAT THIS GIMMICK IS UNNECESSARY AND DANGEROUS.  A PASSING CYCLIST WOULD NOT BE EXPECTING THE DOORS OF ANY EMPTY CAR TO SUDDENLY SWING OPEN.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE.  THANK YOU.  A CONCERNED CITIZEN.",
