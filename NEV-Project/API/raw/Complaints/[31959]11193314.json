WHEN I TURN LEFT, THE LEFT SIDE OF THE CAR MAKES A \"CRUNCHING\" SOUND DUE TO THE RUST ACCUMULATED ON THE SUBFRAME.  THE RUST THAT HAS ACCUMULATED HAS MADE THIS CAR UNSAFE TO DRIVE, AS IT IS STARTING TO CRACK AND COULD CRACK COMPLETELY THROUGH WHEN I AM DRIVING.  OTHER DODGE CALIBER 2007 SUBFRAMES HAVE BEEN RECALLED DUE TO THIS ISSUE, AND THIS VIN SHOULD DEFINITELY BE ADDED TO THAT RECALL.",
