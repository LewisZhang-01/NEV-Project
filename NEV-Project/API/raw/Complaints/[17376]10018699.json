        "summary": "HAD THE DOOR LATCH BREAK ON RIGHT SIDE AND WAS REPAIRED.  THEN HAVE ON GOING ISSUES OF TRYING TO OPEN THE SLIDING DOORS.  AT TIMES YOU COULD NOT OPEN EITHER SLIDER DOORS WITH OUT TRYING TO GET TO RELEASE BY PULLING ON IT WHICH YOU HAD TO OPEN THE OTHER DOOR AND EITHER TRY PULL IT OR PUSHING ON THE DOOR FROM THE INSIDE.  HUSBAND CAME HOME THEN FORGOT HE HAD TO BE VERY GENTLE WITH DOOR OR THAT COULD NOT BELIEVE THE DOOR WOULD NOT OPEN THEN BROKE THE LEFT SLIDING DOOR HANDLE OFF.  NOW IT HAS NO HANDLE AT ALL.  CALLED THE HONDA DEALERSHIP AND SAID IT WARRANTY WAS NO LONGER VALID.  HAD PURCHASED THE EXTENDED WARRANTY AND WHEN TO HAVE IT REPAIR SAID DOOR LATCH WOULD BE COVERED.  THEN WAS TOLD SINCE IT WAS A DESIGN FAULT (WELL KNOW)  IT WOULD NOT BE COVERED.  SINCE THEN I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND I\u0019M THE PERSON WITH THIS PROBLEM.  DEALERSHIP SAID THEY WOULD COVER THE LABOR COST AND NOT THE PART COST.  AFTER REVIEWING HOW MANY TIMES SOME ONE HAS TAKEN THE TIME TO FILE IT HERE.  CONCERN WHY IT HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED.  AS IT STANDS NOT COMFORTABLE ABOUT THE FACT THE SIDE DOORS DO NOT WORK CORRECTLY, IF SOMETHING HAPPENED WERE MY CHILDREN WOULD HAVE TO EXIT THE VAN QUICKLY.  DID CALL HONDA TO SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE.  WAS TOLD IT MAY TAKE 3 DAYS.   *NLM",
