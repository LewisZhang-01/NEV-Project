        "summary": "I WAS STOPPED IN A DRIVE THRU WITH MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND 2 VEHICLES IN FRONT OF ME.  SUDDENLY ,WHILE MY FOOT WAS STILL ON THE BRAKE, MY TRUCK LUNGED FORWARD HITTING THE TRUCK IN FRONT ON ME AND FORCING THAT TRUCK TO HIT THE TRUCK IN FRONT OF THEM. BUT IT DIDN'T END THERE.  WHEN MY TRUCK ORIGINALLY LUNGED, THE ENGINE REVVED AND AFTER HITTING THE TRUCK IN FRONT OF ME, MY TRUCK ENGINE CONTINUED TO REV UP AND DOWN AND MY TRUCK CONTINUED TO BOUNCE OFF AND ON THE TRUCK IN FRONT OF ME.  AFTER THE INITIAL IMPACT I PLACED BOTH FEET ON THE BRAKE AND WAS PUSHING AS HARD AS I COULD TRYING TO MAKE MY TRUCK STOP.  I WAS PRACTICALLY STANDING ON THE BRAKES, BUT I HAD NO CONTROL.  THE REVVING AND BOUNCING OFF AND ON THE TRUCK IN FRONT OF ME WENT ON FOR SEVERAL SECONDS.  FINALLY, MY LEGS GOT TIRED FROM PUSHING SO HARD ON THE BRAKES I JUST TOOK THEM OFF AND THE TRUCK JUST STOPPED MOVING AND ENGINE STOPPED REVVING.  WHEN ALL OF THIS WAS HAPPENING, MY SENSORS NEVER WENT OFF.  ALTHOUGH WHEN MY TRUCK CAME TO A STOP , I PUT IT IN PARK AND GOT OUT TO SEE IF THE PERSON IN FRONT OF ME WAS OK.  I NOTICED THAT I WAS WITHIN 2 INCHES OF HER BUMPER AND WHEN I GOT BACK IN MY TRUCK, THE SENSOR WAS ONLY BEEPING. I CONTACTED AMERICAN HONDA WHO ADVISED ME TO TAKE IT TO HONDA OF BOWIE, WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.  I WAS TOLD THAT AN INSPECTOR FROM AMERICAN HONDA AND THE SERVICE MANAGER FROM HONDA OF BOWIE WOULD INSPECT THE TRUCK THOROUGHLY.  AFTER DOING SO, THEY INFORMED MY HUSBAND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.  I FEEL THERE IS A SAFETY ISSUE WITH THIS TRUCK AND I AM VERY NERVOUS AND ANXIOUS WHEN DRIVING IT. I FEEL HONDA HAS LET ME DOWN AND IS REFUSING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE.  *TR",
