EACH SAID THE PROBLEM WAS COMMON, BUT ONLY 1997 BLAZERS ARE UNDER RECALL.  MY 1996 BLAZER HAS THE SAME MECHANISM AS THE 1997 BLAZER.  I WROTE TO CHEVROLET AND WAS TOLD ONLY 1997'S WERE UNDER RECALL, WHICH I ALREADY KNEW.  I WOULD LIKE THIS DEFECTIVE EQUIPMENT REPLACED.  THIS CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT.*JB",
