        "summary": "LETTER FROM TONY PRIESGEN VIC EPRESIDENT TRITON CORPORATION (WI) OPPOSING EARLY WARNING REPORTING (EWR) REQUIRED BY NHTSA FOR MANUFACTURERS OF SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZE TRAILERS,DOT #2003-2289. MR PRIESGEN OPPOSES  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S IRRATIONAL INTRUSION INTO THE DAY TO DAY INTRUSION INTO THE DAILY OPERATIONS OF TRAILER INDUSTRY. MR PRIESGAN'S COMPANY MANUFACTURS SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZE TRAILERS, LESS THAN 26000 LBS GROSS VEHICLE WEIGHT.  NHTSA'S  EWR REGULATIONS  IF NOT RESCINDED OR SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED WOULD PUT PRIESGEN AND MANY OF HIS COLLEAGUES  OUT OF BUSINESS. NHTSA'S NEW RULE REQUIRES ALL LARGE MANUFACTURERS  OF MOTOR VEHICLES (A TRAILER IS INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITION  OF A MOTOR VEHICLE), STARTING APRIL 1, 2003, TO COMPILE AND SUBMIT  INFORMATIONAL REPORTS ENTITLED EARLY WARNING REPORTS OR EWRS CONTAINING COMPLEX DETAILED DATA ABOUT VEHICLE ACCIDENTS, WARRANTY CLAIMS,SAFETY RELATED ISSUES , AND CUSTOMERS REQUIREMENTS. BECAUSE MR. PRIESGAN COMPANY PRODUCES OVER 500 TRAILERS HE IS LUMPED WITH GIANTS SUCH AS FORD, GMC AND FREUDHHEUN WHO ARE BOUND UNDER TREAD ACT.  ACCORDING TO NHTSA'S OWN ESTIMATES, MR PRIESGEN  WILL BE FORCED TO SPENT $225000 WITHIN NEXT  SEVERAL MONTHS TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS.  THEN, ANOTHER $14100  THIS YEAR  AND THEREAFTER TO COMPLY WITH EWR REQUIREMENTS. MR PRIESGEN INSISTS THAT NEITHER HE OR HIS COLLEAGUES  COULD MEET THOSE FISCAL REQUIREMENTS. FURTHERMORE, TRAILER INDUSTRY IS VERY RARELY INVOLVED IN MAJOR ACCIDENTS OR DEFECT ISSUES AS SPECIFIED BY THE EWR REQUIREMENTS. *AK  *NLM",
