IT FAILED TO CLEAR THE REAR WINDOW, AND I TURNED IT ON AGAIN AFTER NOTICING THAT IT HAD TURNED OFF.  ABOUT 30 SECONDS LATER THE REAR WINDOW EXPLODED; THERE WAS NO PROJECTILE FOUND.  MY WIFE, WHO WAS WITH ME WHEN IT HAPPENED, AND I BELIEVE IT HAS TO BE A FACTORY DEFECT, AND WE SHOULD NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE, YET WE ARE BEING CHARGED BY BUDGET, WHO WAS CHARGED BY THE DEALER, FOR THE REPAIR.*JB",
