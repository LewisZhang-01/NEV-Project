        "summary": "FOR ABOUT A MONTH, MY CHECK BRAKE SYSTEM LIGHT WOULD COME ON ALONG WITH THE ABS AND THE RED BRAKE LIGHTS WHEN I WOULD START MY CAR.  MOST OF THE TIME, I COULD TURN THE CAR OFF AND WAIT FOR THE ELECTRONICS TO TURN OFF THEN START THE CAR AGAIN AND THEY WOULDN'T COME ON AGAIN.  THE LIGHTS CAME ON A FEW TIMES WHILE DRIVING AND THE BRAKES SEEM TO HAVE GIVEN OUT.  I HAD TO REALLY PUSH DOWN ALL THE WAY TO GET THE CAR TO SLOW DOWN.  I TOOK IT IN BUT SINCE IT WAS RANDOM, THEY COULDN'T REPRODUCE IT OR FIND ANYTHING WRONG.  LAST WEEK, THE LIGHTS CAME ON AND WOULDN'T GO OFF AT ALL.  I MADE AN APPOINTMENT AT THE DEALERSHIP AND TOOK IT IN A FEW DAYS LATER.  THE LIGHTS DIDN'T COME ON.  THE DEALERSHIP CALLED TO SAY I NEEDED A NEW HYDRAULIC CONTROL UNIT (HCU).  THE PRICE WAS $4500.  THIS WAS ON TOP OF THE TWO DIAGNOSTIC FEES OF $125 EACH I HAD ALREADY PAID.  ALTOGETHER I HAD TO PAY $4750 AND MY FEH HAS 150,700 MILES ON IT.  *TR",
