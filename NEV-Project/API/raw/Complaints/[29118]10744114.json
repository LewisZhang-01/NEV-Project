I HAVE NOW ENCOUNTER MY PAINT PEELING IN PLACES WHERE THERE HAS BEEN NO DAMAGE TO THE VEHICLE AND RUST IN PLACES WHERE THERE HAS BEEN DAMAGE AS WELL. IN RESEARCHING THIS MODEL YEAR VEHICLE I HAVE FOUND THAT THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE COMPLAINT FOR THIS CAR. I AM WONDERING WHY THERE HAS BEEN NO RECALLS FOR THIS. I SPOKE WITH HONDA BUT THEY INFORMED ME THAT BECAUSE MY VEHICLE WASN'T THE COLOR THEY RECALLED PREVIOUSLY THEY COULD NOTHING ABOUT IT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT AND I AND MY PARENTS HAVE BEEN LOYAL HONDA CUSTOMERS FOR 15 YEARS YET THERE ARE NOT WILLING TO DO ANYTHING FOR ME. I WOULD LIKE THIS RESOLVED AND BE ABLE TO HAVE MY PAINT REPAIRED BEFORE I HAVE MORE PROBLEMS DOWN THE ROAD.",
