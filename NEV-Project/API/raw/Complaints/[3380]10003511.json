MY LOCAL REPAIR SHOP FOUND THE UPPER MANIFOLD LEAKING AND CHARGED ME OVER $900 TO REPLACE IT AND REFILL THE COOLING SYSTEM.  I NOW DISCOVER THAT THIS WAS IN TWO PREVIOUS MFG BULLETINS.  BUICK REFUSES TO REIMBURSE ME SAYING I HAD TO DRIVE IT TO THEIR DEALER (A DISTANCE AWAY).  I FEEL THIS IS UNFAIR.  IT IS A DEFECT THAT I DISCOVERED THEY HAVE RECTIFIED IN RECENT MODELS.",
