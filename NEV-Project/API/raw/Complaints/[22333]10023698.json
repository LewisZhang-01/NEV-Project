FINALLY TOOK IT TO A TRUSTED MECHANIC AND HE AGREES THAT THERE IS NOT A PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES MECHANICALLY EXCEPT THE LOUD SQUEAL.  I AM TOLD THAT I CAN REPLACE THEM IF I WANT TO GET RID OF THE SQUEAL, BUT I DON'T THINK I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY TO REPLACE THE BRAKES SINCE THEY SOLD THE VEHICLE TO ME WITH A SQUEAL.  THE VEHICLE WAS ONLY 5 DAYS OLD THE FIRST TIME I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP.  *JB",
