IT FIRST STARTED WHEN I TRIED TO GET OUT OF MY PARKING SPACE AND COULD NOT PUT MY CAR IN REVERSE.  THE CAR WOULD NOT RESPOND FOR THE FIRST INITIAL ATTEMPTS AND THEN IT VIOLENTLY JERKED INTO REVERSE.  I TOOK MY CAR TO MY MECHANIC AND HE DIAGNOSED A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM.  I AM HAVING A REBUILT TRANSMISSION PUT IN THE CAR FOR $2000, WHICH APPEARS PRETTY COMPETITIVE COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE PRICE OF $4K THAT IS BEING QUOTED OVER THE INTERNET.    LEXUS SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR THIS OBVIOUS DEFECT IN THIS MAKE AND MODEL VEHICLE.  *TR",
