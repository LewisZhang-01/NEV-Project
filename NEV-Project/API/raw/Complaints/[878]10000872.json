CALLED DEALER WHO SEEMED QUITE SURE IT WAS A COIL PACK FAILURE.  VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA IS AWARE OF THESE DEFECTIVE PARTS, BUT DUE TO LACK OF SUPPLY WILL ONLY REPLACE FAILED PARTS.  CAR WAS AT DEALER'S SHOP FOR TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE PART ARRIVED AND WAS INSTALLED.  DEALER/VW ASSUMED ALL COSTS OF RENTAL CAR (EST AT $500 / 14 DAYS @ $35/DAY!).  TURNS OUT ONLY ONE OF THE FOUR COIL PACKS FAILED AND WAS REPLACED, BUT VW OF AMERICA WON'T REPLACE ALL FOUR EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE AWARE OF THE HIGH NUMBER OF FAILURES.  VERY LIKELY THAT THE REMAINING THREE WILL FAIL, AND I WILL HAVE TO TAKE THE CAR BACK IN FOR SERVICE/REPLACEMENT.  THIS FAILURE ALSO POSES A SAFETY HAZARD, AS LOSS OF POWER CAN OCCUR ON HIGHWAYS, ETC.",
