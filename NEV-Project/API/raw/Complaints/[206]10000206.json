ALSO, EXPOSURE TO GAS FUMES (DURING EXTENDED TRIPS AND OVER CUMULATIVE TIME)  CAN BE HARMFUL TO MAJOR ORGAN COMPONENTS WITHIN THE HUMAN BODY - ESPECIALLY TO DEVELOPING INFANTS.      A FORMER COMPLAINT WAS SUBMITTED USING ODI ID: 748730 SURROUNDING DATE: 09/06/2001.  \"COMPONENT: FUEL: FUEL TANK ASSEMBLY: TANK  SUMMARY: SMELL GASOLINE COMING FROM THE FUEL TANK, A SMALL AMOUNT OF GAS WAS LEAKING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE FUEL TANK, DUE TO THE ROLLOVER VALVE WAS LEAKING ON THE FUEL TANK, REPLACE FUEL TANK.\"    THE CONCLUSION LEADS THE READER TO BELIEVE THERE'S POTENTIAL FOR IGNITION IF VEHICLE SHOULD BE IN PROXIMITY OF AN UNEXTINGUISHED CIGGARETTE, EX: AT A STOP LIGHT ONCE A DRIVER/PASSENGER IN PROXIMITY PLUCKS A BUTT NEAR VEHICLE.   THE FINDINGS ALSO LEAD THE READER TO BELIEVE THE ROLL OVER VALVE WILL FAIL WHEN CAPSIZED CONTRIBUTING TO CATISTROPHIC IGNITION/EXPLOSION.",
