I BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DEALER SEVERAL TIMES AND THEY REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT, STATING \"IT'S JUST THE NEW CAR SMELL.\" THIS \"SMELL\" HAS NOT GONE AWAY AND EVERY TIME I DRIVE THE CAR I GET A TERRIBLE TASTE IN MY MOUTH, A HEADACHE AND NAUSEA. I REFUSE TO DRIVE THE CAR AND MY HUSBAND HAS NOW BEEN DRIVING THE CAR WITH A CAR DEODORIZER TO DISGUISE THE SMELL FOR 7 MONTHS AND IT HAS NOT DISSIPATED. THIS IS NOT FAIR THAT THE DEALER WILL NOT DO ANYTHING AND THEY DENY/REFUSE TO TEST OR CONFIRM ANY \"TOXICITY\" EXISTS. I WOULD LIKE THE CAR TO BE TESTED TO RELIEVE ANY CONCERNS THAT I HAVE FOR MY FAMILIES WELL BEING. WE HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN AND I AM NOT SURE OF THE DANGERS OR EFFECT THIS COULD HAVE ON THEIR HEALTH. THIS IS NOT FAIR TO THE CONSUMER THAT A DEALERSHIP WOULD REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING TO ADDRESS OR CORRECT THE SITUATION, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS A LEASED VEHICLE. PLEASE HELP IF YOU CAN!",
