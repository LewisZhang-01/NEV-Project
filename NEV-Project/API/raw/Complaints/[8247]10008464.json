THEY SAID BOTH BRAKE LINES BURST DUE TO SEVERE CORROSION. SINCE THIS WAS AN EXTREME EXPENSE. WE PURCHASED A NEW CAR. I FEEL NO BRAKING SYSTEM SHOULD EVER EXPERIENCE TOTAL BRAKE FAILURE, AND FEEL THAT MAZDA SHOULD AT LEAST REPLACE ONE OF THE BRAKE LINES TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMEONE DOESNT GET KILLED.  *JB",
