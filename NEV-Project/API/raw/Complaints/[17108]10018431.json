I WAS TOLD BY THE MECHANIC THAT THE IGNITION DESIGN MADE THE IGNITION CYLINDERS PRONE TO BREAKING, I BELIEVE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE KEY TO BE INSERTED FULLY.  I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS WITH THE DEALER WHO PERFORMED BOTH REPAIRS AT NO CHANGE, BUT FROM THE MECHANICS COMMENTS, IT APPEARS THAT A DESIGN DEFECT COULD EXIST.  *NLM",
