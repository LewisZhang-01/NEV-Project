I PRACTICALLY WRENCHED MY BACK AS I FORCIBLY STEERED THE CAR AND USED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE TO PULL SAFELY TO THE CURB.  FORD ROADSIDE SERVICE ARRIVED AND DISCOVERED THE SERPENTINE BELT HAD COMPLETELY COME OFF AND WAS DRAGGING ON THE GROUND.  GALPIN FORD DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE BELT BUT SAID NOTHING ABOUT POSSIBLE DEFECTS TO THE BELT OR THE CAR.  I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE CAR - WHAT HAPPENS IF THE BELT COMES OFF WHEN I AM ON THE FREEWAY?",
