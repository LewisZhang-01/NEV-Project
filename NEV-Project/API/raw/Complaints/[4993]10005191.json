A FEW DAYS LATER IT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SHIFT INTO 1ST AND I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP, THEY THEN TOLD ME THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH 1ST GEAR. AFTER TAKING THE TRANMISSION APART AND FIXING 1ST GEAR THEY TEST DROVE IT THEY SAID THE PROBLEM WAS AGAIN NOT FIXED AND THAT MY TRANSMISSION WAS NOW IN ESSENCE EATING ITSELF UP. I THEN HAD MY ENTIRE TRANSMISSION REPLACED BECAUSE EACH TOOTH IN THE GEARS AND RODS WERE BENT OR DAMAGED IN SOME WAY. IN THE END, THEY SAID MY TRANSMISSION MUST HAVE BEEN DEFECTIVE. TO MY KNOWLEDGE THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN THE TRANSMISSIONS AND MY REPLACMENT IS THE SAME AS ALL THE OTHER JETTAS.",
