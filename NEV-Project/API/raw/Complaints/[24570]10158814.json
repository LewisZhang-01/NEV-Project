EVERY 40,000 MILES WE HAVE HAD TO PUT A NEW CATALYTIC CONVERTER ON THE CAR.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AND THE CODE READS CATALYTIC CONVERTER BAD.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS MADE THE REPAIR UNDER WARRANTY EACH TIME, BUT CAN NOT IDENTIFY THE REASON FOR THE CONVERTER GOING BAD.  I HAVE HEARD THIS IS A COMMON ENOUGH PROBLEM THAT GM EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON THE CONVERTERS FOR 10 YEARS OR 120,000 MILES.  THE CAR RUNS WELL AND GETS GOOD MILEAGE.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT NEVER COMES ON, EXCEPT WHEN THE CONVERTER HAS GONE BAD.  I HAVE TRIED E-MAILING GM, BUT GET NO RESPONSE FROM THEM.  WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS HERE?  *JB",
