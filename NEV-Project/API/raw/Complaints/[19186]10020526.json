THE FRONT  BOTTOM EDGE OF THE FUEL TANK  HAS STARTED TO RUST OUT. I HAD BEEN SMELLING FUEL FOR ABOUT A WEEK AND HAD BEEN UNABLE TO LOCATE THE PROBLEM. AFTER FINALLY NOTICING THE LEAK, I REMOVED THE COVER AND FOUND A SMALL PIN HOLE. WHEN INSPECTING THE HOLE, IT TURNED INTO ONE THE SIZE OF A PENCIL ERASER.  TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM, I HAVE DRILLED A HOLE INTO THE PLASTIC PIECE SO THAT IT WILL DRAIN OUT THE WATER THAT IT COLLECTS AND APPLIED A SEALANT TO THE LEAKING FUEL TANK.  I HAVE NOT NOTIFIED GM OF THIS PROBLEM AS OF YET. I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO REPLACE MY FUEL TANK.   *NLM",
