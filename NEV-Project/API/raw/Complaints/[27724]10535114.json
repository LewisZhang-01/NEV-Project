THE TANK WAS FULL BUT THE FUEL GAUGE READ BELOW THE EMPTY. AFTER TAPPING ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL, RESTARTING THE VEHICLE, CHECKING FUSES, ETC NOTHING WORKED SO I TOOK IT TO THE SHOP AND WAS ADVISED THAT GMC HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND WON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. EITHER THE FUEL SENDING UNIT OR THE SENSOR IS BAD AND MUST BE REPLACED AT A COST $500 - $600. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH I SEE THAT THIS IS QUITE THE PROBLEM AMONGST GMC VEHICLE OWNERS AND CONFIRMED THAT GMC WILL DO NOTHING ABOUT IT... NOW MY FUEL GAUGE READS DIFFERENTLY AT EVERY TIME THE VEHICLE IS STARTED; BUT IT NEVER READS CORRECTLY.... THIS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED AND GMC SHOULD STEP UP AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR INFERIOR PARTS.... *TR",
