ONE WHEN BACKING UP AND TURNING, ONE WHEN STRAIGHTENING UP THE WHEELS. ALSO, WHEN TURNING WHILE DRIVING, MANY TIMES THERE IS A NOISE COMING FROM STEERING  - FEELS LIKE A SHORT GRIND RESONATING INTO THE STEERING WHEEL. AT FIRST I THOUGH IT WAS A TIRE HITTING ON SOMETHING ON THE CAR. I'VE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS SINCE THE CAR WAS NEW ( 2007 CHRYSLER PACIFICA).  NOT UNTIL LAST YEAR, DID DEALER TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AND TOOK A LOOK AT IT.  CAR WAS IN FOR A TOTAL OF THREE OR FOUR TIMES.  ONCE FOR AS LONG AS THREE WEEKS. I AM BEING TOLD THE CROSS MEMBER WAS REPLACED. UNFORTUNATELY, THE CAR IS STILL MAKING THE SAME NOISES AND I AM AFRAID IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE. DEALER SAYS THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. I THINK IT IS A BIG SAFETY ISSUE.  SURE FEELS LIKE SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT. *TR",
