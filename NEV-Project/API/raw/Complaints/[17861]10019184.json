WHEN I TOOK IT INTO A DODGE DEALERSHIP, I WAS TOLD THEY NEED TO PLACE A RAIL ON A CHAIN TO PREVENT A RATTLING NOISE. $400 WAS THE QUOTE. I TOLD THEM TO START WORK ON IT. LATER THEY CALLED AND TOLD ME THERE WAS SLUDGE ON THE MOTOR AND IT MUST BE REPLACED. $7000!!! THEY ALSO TOLD ME THEY CAN NOT PUT THE MOTOR BACK IN. THAT IT WOULD NOT START. THEY (OAKLAND DODGE IN MADISON HTS, MI) ALSO TOLD ME THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN CHANGING MY OIL REGULARLY. THIS IS A FALSE ACCUSATION, HOWEVER I DO NOT HAVE OIL CHANGE RECEIPTS. I HAVE ALSO CHANGED MY OWN OIL SEVERAL TIMES. I AM NOW STUCK WITH A RENTAL CAR UNTIL I CAN AFFORD $7000.",
