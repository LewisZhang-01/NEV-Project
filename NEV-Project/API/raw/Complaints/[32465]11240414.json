FORD CLAIMS THIS IS A 'WEAR' ISSUE. I CALLED FORD AND THIS IS THERE DETENTION FOR SWELLING OF THE LUG NUTS.    ACCORDING TO FORD SERVICE TECHS THE LUG CAPS ARE SEPARATING FROM THE LUG NUTS CAUSING THE LUGS TO SWELL TO AN ADDITIONAL MILLIMETER IN DIAMETER.

FORD NEEDS TO REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE PARTS AT THEIR COST NOT THE CUSTOMER.   I WAS ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE A FLAT TIRE AT 1:00 AM IN A GAS STATION PARKING LOT, THANKFULLY NOT ALONG THE BUSY HIGHWAYS.   THIS IS A TRUE SAFETY ISSUE FOR THE MOTORING PUBLIC.   FORD LIKE THE REST OF AMERICA'S COMPANIES GO WITH THE ODDS OF PEOPLE GETTING HARMED OR INJURED VERSES FIXING THE ISSUES FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS.
