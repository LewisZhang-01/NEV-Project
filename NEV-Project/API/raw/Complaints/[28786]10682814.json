WHATEVER WAS GOING ON IT EFFECTED FORWARD MOTION AND SEEMED AS IF THE VEHICLE WAS CONTROLLING ITSELF TO GO FORWARD WHILE MAKING GRINDING SOUNDS. IT CLEARED UP AS I CONTINUED TO DRIVE. I CONTACTED DEALER AND PARKED UNTIL I, CAREFULLY/SLOWING DROVE IT INTO SERVICE DEPARTMENT.  THEY CALLED ME AT WORK AND TOLD ME IT WAS CLKSPRING--STEERING ANGLE/CLOCKSPRING, PART # 56046497AD AND THE COSTS ABOUT $800.00!  I STATED WAS IT A POWERTRAIN ISSUE AND WAS TOLD NO.  NOW, FEBRUARY 2015, THE SAME ISSUE SEEMS TO BE OCCURRING.  THE TRACTION LIGHT IS FLASHING, ESP LIGHT IS LITE.  IF I STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND CLOSE THE DOORS, THEY LOCK ON THEIR OWN (THAT MAY BE A SEPARATE ISSUE, NOT SURE).  *TR",
