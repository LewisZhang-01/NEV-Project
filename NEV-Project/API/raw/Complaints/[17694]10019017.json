IT NOW HAS ABOUT 67,000 MILES ON IT AND WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 6 SERPENTINE BELTS AND 4 BELT TENSIONERS.  WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH 1 BELT PER YEAR AT LEAST SINCE WE BOUGHT THE VEHICLE.  THE DEALERSHIP NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE WAS A DEFECT IN THE ENGINE THAT KEPT CAUSING THE BELT TO BECOME MIS-ALIGNED, START SQUEAKING, AND EVENTUALLY RIP APART. THE PROBLEM IS MORE SEVERE IN HOT WEATHER AND WE HAVE ABOUT 5 MONTHS OF 90 DEGREE WEATHER WHERE WE ARE.  OUR OWN MECHANIC HAS STARTED SHIMMING THE BELT TENSIONER, WHICH SEEMS TO PROLONG BELT REPLACEMENT TIME BUT DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  HE BELIEVES THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE HOLE THAT WAS DRILLED TO INSTALL THE TENSIONER AND/OR PULLEY IS DRILLED AT THE WRONG ANGLE OR NOT LINED UP CORRECTLY. OUR ONLY CONSOLATION IS THAT THE SQUEAKING GIVES US WARNING ABOUT THE STATE OF THE BELT.  *NLM",
