I HAVE THE BRAKING PROBLEM EXACTLY AS IT'S DESCRIBED IN YOUR REPORT, \"MOMENTARY LOSS OF BRAKING CAPABILITY WHILE TRAVELING OVER AN UNEVEN ROAD SURFACE, POTHOLE OR BUMP\".  THIS SEEMS TO OCCUR ABOUT EVERY 50 MILES OF CITY DRIVING, BUT IT'S TOTALLY UNPREDICTABLE.  WHEN IT HAPPENS, I HAVE TO DEPRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL ABOUT TWO MORE INCHES TO REGAIN THE LOST BRAKING.  I INDICATED THIS ON TOYOTA'S NEW OWNER SURVEY BUT NEVER HEARD FROM THE COMPANY.  PLEASE ADD THIS TO THE LIST OF COMPLAINTS. *TR",
