I BELIEVE SOME PONTIAC V6 SUFFERS FROM EITHER DEFECTIVE GASKETS AND OR FAULTY ASSEMBLY THAT CAUSE A LEAK TO DEVELOP AFTER 2-3 YEARS OF USEAGE WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR A NEW CAR PURCHASE AND PONTIAC OFFERING NO SERVICE BULLETINS/RECALLS  ON THIS ISSUE. OUR FAMILY HAS SUFFERED 4 SUCH FAILURES INCLUDING 2- GRANDPRIX'S (1999 & 2000 MODELS) , GRAND AM (1997), SUNFIRE (1997) AMONG NUMEROUS OTHER FAILURES IN MY GENERAL LOCATION.  I WOULD ASK YOUR AGENCY TO LOOK FURTHER INTO THIS POTENTIAL PROBLEM AND RECKIFY THE SITUATION",
