ROTORS HAVE BEEN REPLACED AND RE-MACHINED TWICE, MOST RECENTLY ADVISED TO UPGRADE TO AFTERMARKET CERAMIC PADS, 10K MILES LATER EXACT PROBLEM HAS RETURNED. BRAKES PULSE AT ALL SPEEDS ONCE WARM, BOTH DURING DRIVING AND PARTICULARLY WHEN APPLIED CAUSING VEHICLE AND STEERING WHEEL TO SHIMMY. 80% OF MY DRIVING IS HIGHWAY AND THIS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.  MULTIPLE DEALERS HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS AS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM ON THE 99-01 MODELS BUT THAT CHRYSLER WILL NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE.  NOW I'VE BEEN ADVISED TO REPLACE WITH A NEWER CALIPER DESIGN THAT WILL COST AN ADDTL. $450 BRINGING MY TOTAL BRAKE EXPENSES ON THE FRONT AXLE TO WELL OVER $1000 IN 1 YEAR.    *NLM",
