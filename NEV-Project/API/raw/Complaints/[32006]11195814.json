I NOTICED THE DISPLAY SHOWED ME IN REVERSE EVEN THOUGH THE SHIFTER WAS IN DRIVE. I TRIED SHIFTING GEARS BUT THE DISPLAY STILL HAD ME IN REVERSE EVEN WHEN I SHIFTED TO NEUTRAL AND BACK IN PARK. I TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF AND TRIED TO TURN THE CAR BACK ON BUT IT WOULD NOT START BECAUSE THE DISPLAY STILL SHOWED THE TRANSMISSION IN REVERSE EVEN THOUGH THE SHIFTER WAS STILL IN PARK. BECAUSE OF THIS, THE CAR WOULD ROLL FORWARD. I HAD TO USE MY EMERGENCY BRAKE TO PREVENT THE VEHICLE FROM ROLLING. THIS IS IS A KNOWN RECALL BUT FOR SOME REASON MY VEHICLE'S VIN NUMBER WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL SO I HAD TO PAY FOR TOWING AND REPAIRS OUT OF POCKET.",
