I WAS FORTUNATE THAT THAT ALTHOUGH THE 1/3 OF THE TREAD SEPARATED FROM THE TIRE IT DID NOT BLOW OUT AND I WAS ABLE TO GET TO AN EXIT SAFELY.  I THEN PROCEEDED TO A WALMART TIRE REPLACEMENT CENTER WHERE I ASKED THE TECHNICIAN IF THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD SEEN THIS HAPPEN.  THE TECHNICIAN TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS THE SECOND TIME HE HAD SEEN THIS ISSUE WITHIN THE PAST 2 MONTHS AND THAT THE OTHER TIRE THAT WAS BROUGHT IN FOR REPLACEMENT HAD ONLY BEEN ON THE CAR FOR A FEW WEEKS (MY TIRE WAS ABOUT 2 YEARS OLD).  I CONTACTED FIRESTONE TO INFORM THEM OF THE ISSUE AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY COULD ONLY TAKE ACTION IF I COULD MAIL THEM THE TIRE.  I PROVIDED FIRESTONE THE CONTACT NUMBER FOR THE TIRE SHOP WHERE THEY COULD OBTAIN THE TIRE IF NEEDED FOR ANALYSIS (FIRESTONE WAS NOT INTERESTED IN OBTAINING THE TIRE).  THE TIRE THAT WAS INVOLVED WAS AN FR 680.",
