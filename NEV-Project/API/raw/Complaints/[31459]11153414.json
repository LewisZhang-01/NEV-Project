UPON LATER INSPECTION, I DISCOVERED A 2\" LONG CRACKED LR WHEEL THE CRACK IS LOCATED AT THE BASE OF ONE OF 5 SLENDER SPOKES WHERE IT CONNECTS TO THE BARREL OF THE WHEEL. ANY RETAILER WHO LISTS THIS 18\" FORGED ALUMINUM WHEEL IS OUT OF STOCK AS THIS UPGRADED WHEEL WAS UNDER-DESIGNED FOR THE LOADING THAT HAPPENS TO A HIGH PERFORMANCE VEHICLE. THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE C5 CORVETTES AND COULD RESULT IN A CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENT AT HIGH INTERSTATE SPEEDS.",
