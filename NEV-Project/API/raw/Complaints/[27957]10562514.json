I WAS TOLD VIA THE ZAP GROUP ON YAHOO GROUPS THAT A PERSON IN THE GROUP WAS TOLD THE RECALL PERIOD HAD BEEN EXTENDED TO 01/30/2014. MY ZAP WAS NOT PICKED UP. PLEASE NOTIFY THE COMPANY OF ANY ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY THEY ARE LIABLE FOR BY NOT HONORING THEIR RECALL AGREEMENT.    I HAVE ENJOYED MY LITTLE ELECTRIC TRUCK, USING IT FOR DELIVERY OF NURSERY PRODUCTS TO SHIPPING OUTLETS IN OUR SMALL TOWN OF 2000 IN AN ECONOMICALLY DEPRESSED AREA. IT HAS NEVER GIVEN ME A PROBLEM. STOPPING DISTANCE HAS NEVER BEEN AN ISSUE SINCE I DRIVE CAREFULLY. I AM DISAPPOINTED THIS MODEL WAS CHOSEN FOR THE RECALL AND I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO INSURE IT IN THE FUTURE. I WAS HOPING TO GET THE $3100 AS PROMISED IN THE RECALL EVEN THOUGH I WILL LOSE MORE THAN $10,000 FROM THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE.  *TR",
