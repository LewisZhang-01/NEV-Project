THEY HAVE KNOWN ISSUES WITH THE AIR BAGS IN A NUMBER OF YEAR MODELS. THE 2006 YEAR MODEL NEEDS TO BE INCLUDE IN THESE RECALLS. IS IT A SAFETY ISSUE AND HAVING A DISABLED WIFE RIDING WITH ME MAKES ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE DRIVING IT. THERE ARE NUMEROUS REPORTS OF ISSUES WITH THIS YEAR MODEL ALL OVER THE INTERNET.   *TR",
