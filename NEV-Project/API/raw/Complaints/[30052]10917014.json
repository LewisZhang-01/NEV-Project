I TOOK IT DOWN TO THE DEALERSHIP AND IT TOOK OVER TWO HOURS OF LABOR TO FIGURE OUT THAT IT WAS THE ABS UNIT THAT FAILED. EVEN THE TECHNICIAN WAS SURPRISED THAT THE ABS LIGHT NEVER LIT TO INDICATE A FAILURE. I FOUND IT STRANGE THAT ABS FAILURE WILL DISABLE THE BRAKING SYSTEM. I HAD AN ABS FAILURE ON A CAR BEFORE AND BOTH SYSTEM ARE INDEPENDENT.   I AM A CANADIAN, AND I DID REPORT TO TRANSPORT CANADA  THE ABS UNIT ITSELF IS $1000, WITH LABOR AND MISC PARTS, THE BILL CAME OVER $1800. IT TOOK OVER A MONTH TO GET MY MOTORCYCLE BACK, THE ABS PART WAS ON BACK ORDERED.   THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT.",
