THEY FOUND THE CAR HAD PREMATURE LOOSE PLUGS AND DAMAGED COILS.  REQUIRED REPLACEMENT OF 4 PLUGS AND 2 COILS. THIS HAPPENED AT ONLY 48,077 MILES.  IF SHE HAD NOT BROUGHT IT IN WHEN SHE DID, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS PROBLEM LIKE HER FRIEND WHO WAS ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN THEIR ENGINE WENT DUE TO THE SAME ISSUE WITH LOOSE PLUGS.  APPARENTLY THIS APPEARS TO BE A FACTORY DEFECT IN THIS MODEL.   THEY CHARGED HER $105 AND COVERED THE REST UNDER A \"GOODWILL\" WARRANTY BECAUSE SHE REFUSED TO PAY FOR THE DAMAGE.",
