SIGNIFICANT STEAM WAS GENERATED FROM THE LEAK AND CAUSED A CLOUD BEHIND MY CAR THAT COULD HAVE BLOCKED THE VIEW OF A FOLLOWING VEHICLE.  I WAS TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS WHICH MINIMIZED THE STEAM'S ABILITY TO BLOCK MY VIEW, BUT AT LOWER SPEEDS THE STEAM MAY HAVE COMPLETELY BLOCKED MY VIEW.  CONSIDERING I WAS PASSING A VEHICLE, THERE WAS A RISK THAT IF MY VIEW WAS OBSTRUCTED, AN ACCIDENT WITH EITHER THE VEHICLE BEING PASSED OR ONCOMING TRAFFIC COULD HAVE RESULTED.  I WAS STRANDED UNTIL MY TEMPORARY REPAIRS ALLOWED ME TO LIMP TO THE NEAREST REPAIR FACILITY.  I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A COMMON FAILURE MODE FOR THIS VEHICLE, AND REQUEST AN INVESTIGATION BE INITIATED.*JB",
