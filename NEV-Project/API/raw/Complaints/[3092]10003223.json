THE SECOND TIME, TWO OF THE FOUR INGITION COILS FAILED AND WAITED 15 DAYS FOR REPLACEMENTS.  THE DEALER SAID THE OLD COILS IN THE CAR HAVE A 90% FAILURE RATE, WHILE THE NEW COILS THEY ARE REPLACING THEM WITH HAVE A 20% EXPECTED FAILURE RATE.  I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING A CAR THAT HAS THOSE PROBABILITIES OF FAILURE.  MYSELF AND OTHER PASSAT OWNERS DEMAN VOLKSWAGEN  FIND A SOLUTION FOR THESE COST-CUTTING RELATED MALFUNCTIONS THAT COMPROMISE THE SAFETY OF OUR VEHICLES.",
