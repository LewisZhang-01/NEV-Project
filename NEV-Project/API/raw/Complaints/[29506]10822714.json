AS TWICE BEFORE THE WRENCH ICON APPEARED ON PANEL ALONG WITH '\"AWD OFF\". TURNED OFF ENGINE, WAITED A MINUTE, AND RESTARTED ENGINE. EVERYTHING NOW FINE AND GOT HOME.  TOOK TO FORD DEALER. (FORD OF ESCONDIDO) THEY CANNOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM. TOLD EVERYTHING CHECKED OUT OK. COULD FIND NO ERROR REPORTS UNDER DIAGNOSTICS. TOLD TO PICK UP CAR. LEFT CAR AT DEALER! THIS SUDDEN LOSS OF  POWER IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN. IF I HAD EXPERIENCED THIS ON THE FREEWAY INSTEAD OF THE RAMP, I COULD HAVE REAR ENDED AT 65MPH!",
