SHIFTING WHEN THE TRANSMISSION IS COLD INTO 2ND GEAR FROM 1ST GEAR IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE AND APPEARS TO BE A KNOWN PROBLEM BASED ON MY INTERNET SEARCH.  SEVERAL TIMES I'VE PULLED INTO TRAFFIC AND COULDN'T SHIFT IT INTO 2ND GEAR.  BY THEN THE CAR IS SLOWING DOWN WITH TRAFFIC BEARING DOWN ON IT AND YOU HAVE TO SLOW DOWN EVEN MORE TO GO BACK TO 1ST GEAR.  THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP SAYS THIS IS NORMAL BUT I DISAGREE BECAUSE IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE.  I HAVE TO REV THE ENGINE HIGHER AND GO DIRECTLY INTO THIRD GEAR TO PROTECT MY LIFE.",
