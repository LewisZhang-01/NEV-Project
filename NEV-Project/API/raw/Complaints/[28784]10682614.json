THEN IN JUNE 2014, ANOTHER RECALL DISCUSSED ON TV NEWS AND RECEIVED LETTER IN THE MAIL STATING MY FRONT PASSENGER AIRBAG INFLATOR WAS NOT REPLACED AND REPLACEMENT IS REQUIRED. HOWEVER, THE LETTER FURTHER STATES THAT THERE IS \"NO REMEDY AVAILABLE\" AND IT FURTHER STATES THAT YOU SHOULD NOT USE YOUR VEHICLE IF AT ALL POSSIBLE.  THIS IS AN OUTRAGEOUS STATEMENT ON THE PART OF TOYOTA.  AS I AM THE ONLY CAREGIVER TO MY ELDERLY MOTHER (89 YRS OLD), IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT I HAVE A SAFE OPERATING VEHICLE TO TAKE HER TO ONCOLOGISTS, RADIOLOGY APPOINTMENTS, DENTAL APPOINTMENTS AND PRIMARY CARE CHECK-UPS ON A WEEKLY BASIS.  MY VEHICLE NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED BEFORE A TRAGEDY OCCURS WITH A FATALITY ENDING. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AND TOYOTA WILL AND SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE TO GET THESE REPAIRS DONE NOW VERSES LATER.  TO SAY THERE IS \"NO REMEDY AVAILABLE\" IS LIKE TELLING A VICTIM THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO FIND THE CRIMINAL BECAUSE THEY LACK THE PROPER EQUIPMENT IN THE LAB TO SOLVE THE CRIME!  *TR",
