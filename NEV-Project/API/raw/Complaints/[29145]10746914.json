        "summary": "I BOUGHT THIS 2002 NISSAN ALTIMA ($4500 AT RANDY MARION DEALERSHIP IN HICKORY, NC) FOR MY WIFE ON JANUARY 20TH, 2015. THE CAR HAD 123,000 MILES ON IT. JUST 5 OR 6 DAYS LATER, THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON ENGINE STARTED MAKING A LOUD KNOCKING SOUND WHEN YOU CRANK IT UP AFTER IT HAD SAT FOR A WHILE. I CHECKED THE OIL LEVEL AND IT NEEDED A QUART OF OIL, SO I ADDED A QUART. THE NOISE CAME BACK AFTER 2 DAYS. THIS IMMEDIATELY BECAME A MANDATORY ISSUE TO CHECK THE OIL LEVEL AND ADD MORE OIL EVERY 2 TO 3 DAYS. IT IS NOW AUGUST 7TH AND I HAVE TO CHECK AND REFILL THE OIL EVERY DAY! I STARTED MY RESEARCH FOR COMPLAINTS ON THIS VEHICLE AND FOUND THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ON THE SAME ISSUE ALONG WITH RECALLS FOR REPLACING THE ECM, CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND/OR ENGINE. THE ECM RECALL APPLIED TO THIS CAR, SO I HAD THAT DONE ON JULY 30TH ALONG WITH AN OIL CHANGE. ON TOP OF THAT, I JUST SPENT $1006.62 TO GET THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER REPLACED YESTERDAY ALONG WITH A QUART OF OIL. GOT THE KNOCKING SOUND AGAIN THIS MORNING. I TOOK IT TO THE CLOSEST DEALERSHIP THIS MORNING AND THEY SAID IT NEEDS A NEW ENGINE. MY WIFE AND I ARE SO UPSET NOW. WE FEEL LIKE WE WERE SOLD SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM (CERTIFIED LEMON) FROM A DEALERSHIP THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE RESOLD IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. HOW MUCH MORE COMPLAINTS IS GOING TO BE NEEDED FOR SOMEONE TO MAKE NISSAN FIX THIS PROBLEM???",
