RIGHT NOW IT IS STANDING AROUND 3\" FROM THE FRAME AND I AM AFRAID THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO TRANSGRESS INTO MY LINE OF SIGHT.  I HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT THE DEFROST/DEFOGGER ON THE CAR DOES NOT WORK WELL ANYMORE SINCE THE PEELING HAS OCCURRED.  THE DASH IS ALSO LIFTING AWAY FROM THE FRAME JUST ABOVE AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE INSTRUMENT PANEL.  MY CAR IS EQUIPPED WITH DUAL FRONT AIR BAGS AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS WARPING OF THE DASH MAY IN SOME WAY EITHER CAUSE A PREMATURE RELEASE OF THE PASSENGER AIR BAG OR PREVENT THE RELEASE OF THE BAG WHEN IT MAY BE NEEDED.  I HAVE NOTED THIS SAME PHENOMENON ON OTHER KIA SEPHIAS IN THE CITY WHERE I LIVE.",
