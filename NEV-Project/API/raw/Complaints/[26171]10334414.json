        "summary": "NO CRASHES, BUT VERY CONCERNED THAT THE CAR LUNGES FORWARD OFTEN.  IT ALSO HAS EXPERIENCED POWER FAILURE ON 4 OCCASIONS IN THE 4 YEARS I HAVE HAD IT.  FOR EXAMPLE, OFTEN WHEN I AM IN A PARKING LOT AND PUT THE VEHICLE INTO EITHER DRIVE OR REVERSE IT LUNGES. I  ALWAYS KEEP MY FOOT VERY FIRMLY ON THE BRAKE AND IT GROANS SOMETIMES UNDER THE STRAIN.   WHEN I PULL INTO MY GARAGE SLOWLY, WITH FOOT ON BRAKE I GO TO PUT INTO PARK AND IT WILL TRY TO LURCH FORWARD WHEN COMING TO A STOP.  IT IS LIKE IT DOES NOT WANT TO STOP.  I AM VERY CAREFUL AND HAVE NOT HIT ANYTHING BUT AM WORRIED AS THIS SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING MORE REGULARLY.  I TOOK IT INTO THE DEALER IN AUGUST OF 2009 AND THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM OR DUPLICATE IT.  I TOOK IT IN AGAIN TODAY JUNE 3, AND THEY COULD NOT FIND IN THEIR RECORDS WHERE I HAD IT IN LAST YEAR. I SHOWED THEM MY RECEIPT AS PROOF.   I HAVE BEEN TOLD IT IS A THROTTLE BODY PROBLEM, BUT THEY WILL NOT JUST CLEAN IT, THEY SAY IT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $700 TO ME AND IS NOT COVERED UNDER MY WARRANTY. (SAID IT IS INJECTION SYSTEM, NOT MY POWERTRAIN).  I HAVE ONLY 44,000 MILES ON THIS VEHICLE, AND IT WAS DOING THIS AT 34000 LAST YEAR (ACTUALLY EVEN BEFORE THAT IT DID IT, BUT THAT IS THE FIRST TIME I TOOK IT IN FOR THIS PROBLEM).  THE PROBLEM HAPPENS MORE COMMONLY AS TIME GOES BY.   I AM LISTING AS THE 'INCIDENCE DATE' THE MOST RECENT ONE, BUT ITS HAPPENED FOR TWO YEARS NOW.   LAST WEEK IT STALLED OUT AT A DRIVE THROUGH WINDOW.  *TR",
