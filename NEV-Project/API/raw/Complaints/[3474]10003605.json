I AM PAYING MY LEASE, AND AM NOT ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR FURTHER THAN A FEW MILES.  I LIVE IN A REMOTE AREA OF MAINE, WHERE THE TEMPERATURE IS WELL BELOW ZERO MUCH OF THE TIME.  I COULD FREEZE TO DEATH WAITING FOR A TOW TRUCK!!  WHY IS THERE NOT A RECALL.  WHY CAN'T THE COMPANY PUT A HOLD ON COMPLETING NEW CARS AND THEREFORE INSTALL 4 COILS AT A TIME INSTEAD OF ONE AS THEY GO??  WHY SHOULD I CONTINUE TO PAY FOR THIS CAR UNLESS IT IS FIXED?",
