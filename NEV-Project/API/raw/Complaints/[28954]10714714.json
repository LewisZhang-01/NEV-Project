A COUPLE MONTHS LATER WE TOOK THE CAR TO SANTA MONICA DEALER 18TH STREET. THEY STATED THE POWER STEERING PUMP WAS LEAKING AND THE RACK NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THEY SAID THAT I HAVE TO PAY $1200.00 BUT HONDA ACCORD AMERICA WAS GOING TO GIVE ME A 50% DISCOUNT. I PAID 50%. THEN WHEN DRIVING BACK TO MY HOUSE, I HEARD A LOT OF NOISE, LIKE SOMETHING WAS LOOSE. THE NOISE GOT WORSE, WHEN I WAS TURNING LEFT, RIGHT OR GOING INTO A DEEP AREA. SO I TOOK THE CAR BACK AND THEY SAID, THEY CANNOT HEAR THE NOISE.  I TOOK THE CAR BACK AND NOW THEY ARE SAYING THAT NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THE CAR. THEY SAID THE STRUTS ARE DAMAGED AND POWER STEERING HOSES ARE LIKING ALL OVER. CAR ONLY HAS 30,000 MILES, I DON'T REALLY USE IT THAT MUCH. THIS IS A LEMON CAR. CAN SOMETHING BE DONE?  *TR",
