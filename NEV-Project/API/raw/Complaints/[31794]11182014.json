I FIGURED MY WIFE HAD LEFT HER LIGHTS ON AND LOOKED IN THE CAR TO SEE THEY WERE OFF. I STARTED THE CAR AND PRESSED THE BRAKE A FEW TIMES BUT THE LIGHTS REMAINED ON SO I THOUGHT THE SWITCH HAD GONE BAD. MY WIFE WATCHED AS I PRESSED THE BRAKE PEDAL SWITCH MANUALLY AND THE SWITCH WORKED BUT THE PEDAL DID NOT COME FAR ENOUGH BACK TO DEPRESS THE SWITCH AND I SAW ONLINE THAT A PAD WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PRESENT BUT WAS MISSING.  I FOUND RECALLS FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS MENTIONING AN ISSUE WITH PAD DETERIORATION AND FIGURE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING TO THIS MODEL AS WELL.",
