THE MANUFACTURER STICKER WITH GVWR ETC STATES TIRE PRESSURE AT 50 PSI.  LOAD RANGE B TIRES ARE DESIGNED FOR 35 PSI.  SOME MONTHS AGO I SENT THE MANUFACTURER AN EMAIL ADVISING THEM OF THIS.  THEY SAID 50 PSI WAS SAFE.  I REQUESTED CONFIRMATION FROM GOODYEAR, WHICH RESPONDED THAT 35 PSI WAS THE MAXIMUM.  I ADVISED THE MANUFACTURER, WHO ASKED IF I WANTED A NEW STICKER.  I ASKED IF THEY SHOULDN'T RESEARCH TO SEE HOW MANY TRAILERS HAD THE WRONG INFO, SINCE THIS COULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE.  THEY BECAME INDIGNANT AND REFUSED TO DISCUSS IT FURTHER BY EMAIL.  THAT CONCERNS ME, BECAUSE SUCH OVERINFLATION COULD WELL CAUSE A BLOWOUT, ENDANGERING LIVES.
