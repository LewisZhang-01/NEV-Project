WHEN I GOT OUT OF THE CAR THE EXHAUST SMELT REALLY BAD. WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER THE FOLLOWING DAY, HE INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS A IGNITION COIL PACK FAILURE AND THAT THIS PROBLEM WAS REALLY COMMON WITH THE 1.8L TURBO ENGINES. HE ALSO INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS A NATIONAL BACKLOG WITH THE PART AS THERE HAD BEEN MANY FAILURES AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO WAIT ATLEAST 2-3 WEEKS BEFORE THE PART WOULD BE AVAILABLE. I WOULD CONSIDER THIS FAILURE TO BE A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IF THE CAR HAD LOST POWER IN A BUSY ROAD OR A FREEWAY IT WOULD HAVE CREATED A DANGEROUS SITUATION.",
