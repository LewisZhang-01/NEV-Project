TWO ATTEMPTS BY DEALER TO RESET THE DOOR,  INCLUDING A NEW HINGE, HAVE FAILED TO RETURN THE DOOR AND WINDOW TO ORIGINAL POSITION AGAINST THE DOOR SEAL, RESULTING IN A CONSTANT WIND NOISE WHICH IS VERY ANNOYING. HINGE OR DOOR FRAME TO WHICH IT IS ATTACHED APPEAR TO BE INSUFFICIENT IN STRENGTH. EVERY TIME THE DOOR IS OPENED FULLY THE HINGE CAN BE SEEN TO BEND AWAY FROM THE STRUCTURE TO WHICH IT IS ATTACHED IN THE DOOR FRAME. DOOR ALSO DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE A \"STOP\" TO PREVENT REOCCURENCE OF THIS PROBLEM. GM DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE A RETROFIT PROGRAM IN PLACE TO REPLACE THE HINGE OR DOOR FRAME.",
