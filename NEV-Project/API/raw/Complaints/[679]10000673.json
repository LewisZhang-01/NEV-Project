        "summary": "OUR 2000 NISSAN XTERRA SE EXPERIENCED A SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER WHILE TRAVELLING AT HIGH SPEEDS ON A HIGHWAY. WE WERE IN THE RIGHT LANE AND WERE ABLE TO COAST TO THE SHOULDER, BUT IF WE WERE IN ANY OF THE OTHER LANES, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN SERIOUS TROUBLE. THE CAR COULD NOT BE RESTARTED AND WE WERE STUCK. THE PROBLEM WAS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS... THE BATTERY WAS FULLY CHARGED, THE GAS TANK WAS FULL, THE GAS CAP WAS TIGHTLY SECURED AT THE MOST RECENT FILLING, THE SERVICE LIGHTS ON THE DASHBOARD NEVER CAME ON INDICATING A POTENTIAL PROBLEM... IT WAS VERY SUDDEN AND VERY SCARY. AFTER HAVING IT TOWED, THE DEALER FOUND THE PROBLEM... A CORRODED WIRE CONNECTION ON THE FUEL PUMP SENDING UNIT. I CHECKED THE XTERRA OWNERS CLUB WEBSITE AND FOUND THAT SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM. ONE PERSON HAD IT HAPPEN TO THEM IN THE HIGH SPEED LANE DURING A HEAVY SNOWSTORM, BUT THEY WERE LUCKY THAT THE TRAFFIC WAS ALREADY MOVING SLOWLY. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION AND SHOULD BE COVERED BY A RECALL BY NISSAN SO THAT OTHER XTERRA OWNERS GET THIS PART REPLACED BEFORE IT HAPPENS TO THEM.",
