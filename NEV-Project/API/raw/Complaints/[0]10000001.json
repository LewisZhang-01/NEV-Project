I AM AWARE THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS ENGINE AND THE ASSOCIATED TSB(09-05-98).  WHEN I NOTICED THE LEAK, I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALER IN TOWN AND WAS   TOLD THAT THE REGIONAL OFFICE DENIED MY REQUEST FOR PAYMENT OF THE   REPAIR.  I DID NOT HAVE THE REPAIR DONE, BUT GOT AN ESTIMATE FOR $800.    NEXT, I CONTACTED THE CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE IN DETROIT,   MI.(1-800-992-1997).  I WAS TOLD POLITELY THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO HELP   ME BUT THAT MY CAR WAS TOO FAR OUT OF WARRANTY AND THAT THERE WAS NO   WARRANTY EXTENSION FOR THIS PROBLEM.  I ASKED WHY SOME PEOPLE RECEIVED   ASSISTANCE FOR THE SAME PROBLEM WHILE OTHERS DID NOT, AND WAS TOLD THAT   \"THIS OFFICE WOULD NOT HAVE AUTHORIZED THOSE PAYMENTS\".  I ASKED FOR A   NUMBER OR ADDRESS TO MAKE AN APPEAL TO THIS DECISION AND WAS TOLD THAT   THEY HAD ALREADY MADE THE FINAL DECISION, THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TO   APPEAL TO, AND THE DECISION WOULD NOT BE OVERTURNED.",
