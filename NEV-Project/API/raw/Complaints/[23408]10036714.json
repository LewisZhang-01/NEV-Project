        "summary": "I PURCHASED A USED 1985 JAMBOREE/RALLYE 20 ' MOTORHOME TWO YEARS AGO WITH SIX FIRESTONE STEELTEX RADIALS R4S 8.75X16.5 ON IT.  FIVE OF THOSE TIRES  FAILED IN THAT TIME.  FOUR OF THEM VIOLENTLY WHILE TRAVELING ON HIGHWAYS. FORTUNATELY ALL FOUR WERE ON THE DUALLY REAR WHICH SAVED THE VEHICLE FROM LOSS OF CONTROL.  ALL FOUR HAD BELT SEPARATION AND LOSS OF THE MIDDLE OF THE TREAD, CAUSING MINOR DAMAGE TO THE CHASIS, EXHAUST AND TRIM.  FIFTH FAILURE WAS AT SLOW SPEED AND THE BELT FAILURE CAUSED THE TIRE TO LUMP AND BECOME OBLONG.  FIRESTONE'S CUSTOMER SERVICE LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED.  THEY WANT THE  TIRES FOR EXAMINATION BUT WANT ME TO PAY FOR THE FREIGHT CHARGES.  AS I WAS ON A LONG VACATION WHEN THEY FAILED, I JUST REPLACED THEM WITH A DIFFERENT BRAND.  I DID NOT HAVE ROOM TO SAVE THE FAILED TIRES, BUT DID TAKE SEVERAL PICTURES OF ONE OF THEM.  I DID SAVE THE LAST ONE WHICH JUST WENT OBLONG.  I SENT BACK TO \"COMPLAINT PACKAGE\" THEY SENT ME AFTER FILLING IT OUT AND JUST RECEIVED A NOTICE THAT I DIDN'T COMPLY BY SENDING THE TIRES!  THEY DIDN'T EVEN READ THE COMPLAINT FORM!  I CALLED THEM AGAIN TO WAIT 20 MINUTES ON HOLD ONLY TO BE TOLD BY A MACHINE TO LEAVE MY NAME AND NUMBER FOR SOMEONE TO CALL ME BACK.  THAT WAS TWO DAYS AGO, NO CALL.  PLEASE ANYONE OUT THERE WITH FIRESTONE STEELTEX RADIALS GET RID OF THEM AND REPLACE IT WITH A SAFE TIRE FROM ANOTHER MANUFACTURER!!!  DO NOT PURCHASE ANY FIRESTONE OR BRIDGESTONE TIRES (SAME COMPANY).  THERE WAS NO ADVANCE WARNING, THEY WERE NOT OVERLOADED AND THE AIR PRESSURE WAS CHECKED EVERY DAY!!!*AK",
