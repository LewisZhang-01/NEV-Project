I NOTICED 2 MORE BRAKE LINES HAVE RUPTURED. YES 2 MORE, I HAVE ALREADY REPLACED 2 BRAKE LINES. AS OF AUGUST 14 2011 I HAVE WRITTEN AN EMAIL TO CHEVROLET AS MY VEHICLE SITS IN THE DRIVEWAY WITH RUPTURED, RUSTED BRAKE LINES. I DO NOT EVEN WANT TO IMAGINE THE CONSEQUENCES OF A RUPTURED BRAKE LINE WHILE EMPTY OR TOWING OUR RV AT NORMAL DRIVING SPEEDS. I TRULY FEEL MY FAMILY'S LIFE IS AT RISK IN THIS VEHICLE. FURTHERMORE I CAN SPECULATE THAT THE RESALE VALUE HAS BEEN EFFECTED. MORALLY I COULD NOT SELL THIS VEHICLE KNOWING THERE IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE LOOMING.  *TR",
