THE SMELL COMES FROM THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR AND, WHEN THE DEFROSTER IS ON, IT SUCKS THE TERRIBLE SMELL RIGHT INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE.  (NOTE TO NHTSA:  YOU HAVE SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ALREADY LISTED ABOUT THIS PROBLEM UNDER BOTH \"CATALYTIC CONVERTER,\" \"EXHAUST SYSTEM,\" AND \"DEFROSTER\"...THEY ARE ALL THE SAME THING.)  I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.  THEY HAVE TOLD ME: 1) THAT IT IS THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER, 2) THAT IT HAPPENS IN ABOUT 70 OF EVERY 3,000+ CARS PRODUCED, 3) THAT I SHOULD TRY A NEW GASOLINE AND 4) THAT IT WILL GO AWAY AT AROUND 6,000 MILES.  I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL NEW GASOLINES AND AM CURRENTLY AT 5,000 MILES WITH NO CHANGE TO THE SMELL.  I WILL TAKE MY CAR INTO THE SHOP TWO MORE TIMES FOR THE SAME COMPLAINT AND THEN WILL ATTEMPT TO INVOKE THE LEMON LAW IN OREGON.",
