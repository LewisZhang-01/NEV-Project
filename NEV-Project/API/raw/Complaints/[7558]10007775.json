        "summary": "REAR SEATBELT DIFFICULT TO LATCH WTIH CHILD SEAT / BOOSTER SEAT PRESENT.    WHEN USING A CHILD SAFETY SEAT WITH BUILD IN STRAPS IN COMBINATION WITH THE CENTER REAR SEAT LAPBELT WITH OPTIONAL STUD MOUNTED ON STRAP FOR SHOULDER BELT ATTACHMENT, THIS FLAW IS NOT THAT EVIDENT.    ALTHOUGH, AS THE CHILD PROGRESSES INTO THE BOOSTER SEAT STAGE AND HAS OUTGROWN THE WEIGHT OF THE CHILD SEAT SAFETY STAPS, THE USE OF A BOOSTER SEAT IN THE CENTER REAR WITH COMBINATION LAP BELT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO LATCH.   THE ACT OF LATCHING THE SEATBELT CAN RANGE FROM FIRST TRY TO 20 OR 30 ATTEMPTS BEFORE IT LATCHES.    MULTIPLE FEMALE SEAT BELT RECEPTICLES WHERE USED, SAME EFFECT ON ALL.    IT APPEARS THAT THE DEATCHABLE SHOULD BELT ASSEMBLY HAS A RATHER LARGE METAL BUCKLE THAT HAS SUCH A LARGE AREA THAT IT PREVENTS THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLE FROM ALLOWING ENOUGH OF THE SEAT BELT SLOT TO ENTER THE RECEPTIBLE FOR THE EVIDENT CLICK.    IF CAR IS NOT TAKEN, THE CAR SEAT MAY INADVERTANTLY BE LEFT UNBELTED IF THE CLICK IS NOT HEARD.      ONCE THE BUCKLE DOES PERFORM THE \"CLICK\" IT APPEARS TO BE SECURE, BUT AS A DRIVER I CONSTANTLY WORRY ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF THAT BELT ASSEMBLY.    THIS PROBLEM APPEAR TO SHOW MORE OFTEN DURING COLDER WINTER MONTHS.  40F AND BELOW.",
