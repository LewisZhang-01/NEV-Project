        "summary": "IT HAPPENED IN A SUNDAY AFTERNOON.  I  WAS DRIVING MY TRUCK 2013 TOYOTA TACOMA (BRAND NEW LESS THAN A MONTH).  I HAD FRIENDS RIDING WITH ME.  I KNEW THERE IS A STOP SIGN AND I SAW THE STOP SIGN ABOUT SEVERAL BLOCKS AWAY AND LIFTED MY RIGHT FOOT OFF THE GAS PEDAL.  WHEN I SLIGHTLY APPLIED MY RIGHT FOOT ON THE BRAKE PEDAL, MY TRUCK DIDN'T EVEN SLOW DOWN A BIT EVEN THOUGH I PUSHED THE BRAKE PEDAL TO THE FLOOR.  MY TRUCK KEPT GOING LIKE ACCELERATING ITSELF WITH BIG NOISE LIKE VROOOOOOOOOOM.  I KEPT MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND MEANWHILE SHIFTED THE STICK FROM D TO N TO R TO P JUST IN SPLIT OF A SECOND.  EVERYBODY IN MY TRUCK WAS SCARED BECAUSE MY TRUCK ALMOST REARED INTO THE CAR AT THE STOP SIGN AND MY FRIENDS THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO CRUSH INTO THE CAR IN FRONT OF US.     THE DEALER GROUNDED THE TRUCK THE NEXT DAY AFTER I REPORTED THE INCIDENT AND PROMISED TO MAKE A THOROUGH SERVICE TO THIS VEHICLE AND FIND THE PROBLEM.  *TR",
