I PULL OF AT THE NEAREST EXIT AND STOP AT AN OIL CHANGE SERVICE STATION.  THE MECHANIC SAY I HAD NO ANTIFREEZE IN THE CAR. HE REFILLS THE ANTIFREEZE AND I WAS ON MY WAY. 20 MINS INTO MY DRIVE, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON AND THE THERMOSTAT LOOKS FINE, BUT THE CAR STARTED SPUTTERING AND STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY AREA OF NYC. I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A MECHANIC AND AFTER THEIR DIAGNOSTIC TEST THEY SAID THE ENGINE HEAD IS CRACKED OR WARPED AND THEY FOUND ANTIFREEZE MIXED IN OIL AND RADIATOR AND WILL COST $2500 TO FIX! WTF!! IS THIS ALLOWED TO HAPPEN?? I TOOK GREAT CARE OF THIS VEHICLE AND I FEEL LIKE A SUCKER! NOW I CAN'T GET TO WORK, CAN'T GET MY KIDS TO OR FROM SCHOOL AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO DO AT THIS POINT!  *TR",
