        "summary": "MY 22 MONTH OLD HAD BEGUN UNCLIPPING THE CHEST LATCH ON HER CHILD SAFETY SEAT ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO.  AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS OF DISTRACTING HER AND DISCIPLINING HER SHE PROCEEDED TO NOT ONLY UNLATCH THE CHEST PLATE OF THE SEAT BUT ALSO WIGGLE OUT OF THE SHOULDER STRAPS.  WE HAVE A CENTURY ACCEL MODEL # A 45100STH  NOT SURE OF MANUFACTURE DATE BECAUSE THE STICKER HAD CHIPPED OFF.  THE LOT NUMBER IS 664351-01.  HER SEAT WAS NOT ON THE RECALLED LIST.  ON THIS DAY THAT SHE GOT OUT COMPLETELY OF THE SHOULDER STRAPS I MADE A PHONE CALL TO THE MANUFACTURER.  I ASKED IF THEY WERE ANY CHILD PROOF COVERS AVAILABLE TO DETER MY CHILD FROM UNLATCHING HER SEAT.  SHE TOLD ME THAT CHILD CAR SEATS ARE NOT CHILD PROOF AND THAT I MUST TEACH MY CHILD THAT IT IS DANGEROUS TO UNLATCH THE SEAT.  TO ME THIS IS APPALLING!  IT TAKES TIME FOR A CHILD TO LEARN THINGS AND WHAT HAPPENS DURING THIS LEARNING PROCESS IF WE WERE TO GET IN AN ACCIDENT??  I BELIEVE THAT SINCE CAR SEATS ARE MADE SPECIFICALLY FOR CHILDREN OF HER AGE THAT THEY *SHOULD* BE CHILD PROOF!!  HOW CAN THEY NOT BE??  MY CHILD IS NOT EXCEPTIONAL, IF SHE CAN GET OUT OF HER CAR SEAT THEN I AM CERTAIN OTHER CHILDREN CAN.  AND HOW ON EARTH CAN THEY BE SAFE IF 1 1/2 YEAR OLDS CAN GET OUT??    SO MY COMPLAINT IS THIS.  PLEASE MAKE A LAW WHERE IT IS PERTINENT FOR CHILD SAFETY SEATS TO BE CHILD PROOF!  HOW CAN THEY BE CHILD SAFETY SEATS IF A CHILD CAN GET OUT OF THEM!    ALSO I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE STICKERS ON THIS CAR SEAT.  IT IS LESS THAN ONE YEAR OLD.  IT HAS BEEN IN A TINTED VEHICLE AND ALL OF THE SAFETY STICKERS ARE ALL FOLDED UP, MELTED AND CRUMBLED.  I CANNOT EVEN READ THE MANUFACTURE  DATE ON THE SEAT.  SOME HOW THESE NUMBERS NEED TO BE EMBEDDED INTO THE SEAT TO ENSURE THE ABILITY TO CHECK SAFETY RECALLS.            *JB",
