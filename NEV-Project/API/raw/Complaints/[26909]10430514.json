WHAT OCCURRED WAS THE PLASTIC COATING ON THE CABLE HAD CRACKED AND BUNCHED UP AND STUCK IN THE PULLEY OF THE DOOR SYSTEM.    IN ORDER TO MOVE, WE HAD TO CUT THE STEEL CABLE (WHICH WASN'T EASY).  WHICH ALLOWED US TO CLOSE THE DOOR MANUALLY.  THE DOOR CAN NOT BE FIXED BY SIMPLY PUTTING ANOTHER CABLE IN.  IT REQUIRES THE ENTIRE MOTOR ASSEMBLY TO BE CHANGED.  WHICH COST BETWEEN $1500-2000.  *TR",
