SINCE THE CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY I HAD THE RACK AND PINION REPLACED.  I RECEIVED A CAMPAIGN LETTER FROM PONTIAC STATING THAT THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM.  I WENT TO EWING PONTIAC AND THEY CONFIRMED  THE PART WAS INDEED REPLACED AND I GAVE THEM THE ORIGINAL RECEIPTS FOR THE PARTS AND LABOR BUT THEY REFUSED TO REIMBURSE ME BECAUSE THE RECEIPT DID NOT STATE THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE HARD STEERING.  I EXPLAINED THAT THE MECHANIC WAS A VIETNAMESE WHO COULD NOT WRITE IN TECHNICAL ENGLISH.  CONTACTED PONTIAC ADN OPENED TICKET 1-89071665 AND AFTER A WEEK WAS BASICALLY TOLD THE SAME THING.  PONTIAC WILL LOSE A LOYAL CUSTOMER BECAUSE OF THIS! *JB",
