THE GARAGE THAT REPAIRED MY VEHICLE SAID THAT THERE WAS A DISTINCT DEFECT IN THE TORSION BAR AND GAVE ME THE BAR TO OFFER PROOF TO FORD THAT THIS WAS INDEED AND MANUFACTURER DEFECT. THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY WAS CONTACTED AND NOTIFIED OF THIS PROBLEM. THE COMPANY DRAGGED CORRESPONDANCE OUT WITH US OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS. NO RECALL WAS ENACTED.   ON JANUARY 4, 2003 THE LEFT TORSION BAR WENT ON MY 1998 FORD EXPEDITION AS I WAS EXITING THE HIGHWAY. THE TRUCK DROPPED ABOUT 12 INCHES ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE AND I SLAMMED MY HEAD ON THE DRIVER WINDOW. NO SERIOUS INJURY RESULTED, BUT I COULD HAVE LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE AND CAUSED SERIOUS INJURY TO THE OTHERS IN THE CAR AS WELL AS MYSELF.",
