THIS IS VERY DISTRACTING, ANNOYING, AND UN-NERVING BECAUSE IT CAUSES THE CAR IN FRONT OF YOU TO BELIEVE YOU ARE FLASHING YOUR LIGHTS AT THEM.  I HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS PROBLEM 3 TIMES SINCE I FIRST BOUGHT IT IN APRIL 2002.  DEALER STATES THEY CAN'T FIX THE PROBLEM, WON'T TRY AND IT'S NORMAL. THIS WAS NOT DISCLOSED TO ME WHEN I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE OTHERWISE HAD I KNOWN, I WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT IT.  *JB",
