        "summary": "WE WERE ON OUR WAY BACK FROM VACATION IN SOUTH CAROLINA DOING THE SPEED LIMIT OF 70 AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I HEARD A LOUD BANG, THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE DROPPED DOWN ON THE TRUCK.  THE TRUCK LOST CONTROL AND WENT INTO A GUARD RAIL, THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYED, THE REAR END OF THE TRUCK CAME AROUND AND THE TRUCK BEGAN TO FLIP.  ONCE THE TRUCK CAME TO A STOP THEY HAD TO CUT THE ROOF OFF AND WINDSHIELD TO GET US OUT.  I WAS TAKEN BY AMBULANCE TO THE HOSPITAL AND MY SON FOLLOWED WITH THE SHERIFF AND OUR DOG.  THERE IS NO EXPLAINATION TO WHY THE PASSENGER SIDE TIRE CAME OFF WITH ONLY A FEW MARKS AND FULLY INTACT.  THE MYSTERY TO EVERYONE IS WHY IS THERE ONLY HALF A RIM???  THE RIM WAS OFF THE VEHICLE ALONG WITH THE TIRE BEING OFF THE RIM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.  THE SHERIFF LOOKED ALONG WITH OTHER PEOPLE TO NOT FIND THE OTHER HALF THE RIM.  THE TOW TRUCK COMPANY LOOKED TO SEE IF THE HALF RIM WAS THERE BUT CANNOT FIND ANYTHING. THE TRUCK AT THE MOMENT IS AT BULL DOG TOWING IN SOUTH CAROLINA (803)865-3800.   THE CLAIM IS BEING HANDLED BY HANOVER INSUARANCE - [XXX] - 1-800-628-0250 EXT. [XXX]  - CLAIM # - [XXX]. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS CONSIDERING I HAVE FOUND THAT FORD HAS AN ISSUE WITH THERE 2014 FORD EDGE WHEELS BUSTING IN HALF AND THE VEHICLES WRECKING.
