THE PLACEMENT OF THESE CRUCIAL SIGNALS IS LOCATED IN AN UNEXPECTED AND LESS VISIBLE LOCATION TO OTHER DRIVERS .  I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN A REAR-END COLLISION (AND HAVE HAD MANY CLOSE CALLS) ON THE HIGHWAY LIKELY BECAUSE THE DRIVERS BEHIND ME DO NOT NOTICE MY BRAKE LIGHTS ILLUMINATING. THE BRAKE LIGHTS COULD EASILY BE MOVED TO THE CURRENT FOG LIGHT LOCATION AND THE TURN SIGNALS COULD BE MOVED TO WHERE THE REVERSE LIGHTS ARE NOW LOCATED - THIS WOULD PROVIDE A COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO THIS SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN.         *TT",
