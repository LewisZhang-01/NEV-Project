        "summary": "2002 LINCOLN CONTINENTAL.  FRONT AIR DAM MADE OF BRITTLE PLASTIC AND BREAKS IF IT TOUCHES ANYTHING.  THIS VEHICLE HAS 8500 MILES AND TWO AIR DAMS HAVE BROKEN.  LINCOLN/MERC DEALER REPLACED ONE BUT REFUSES TO REPLACE ANOTHER.  CUSTOMER SERVICE SAYS THE DAMAGE IS DUE TO \"DRIVER CARELESSNESS\" AND REFUSES TO REPLACE.  THIS ITEM IS EXTREMELY FRAGILE AND HAS NO \"GIVE\".  THE DEALER AT FIRST STATED THAT \"THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM\" WITH THE CONTINENTAL BUT NOW STATES IT IS THE \"CUSTOMERS FAULT\".  THE DEALER ALSO STATES THAT DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE COULD OCCUR OF IT IS NOT REPLACED BECAUSE IT DIRECTS THE AIR THROUGH THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  WE HAVE PERSONALLY INSPECTED OTHER LINCOLN VEHICLES AND NUMEROUS HAVE THE EITHER COMPLETELY MISSING OR DAMAGE AIR DAMS.  IT APPEARS THIS IS A QUICK $ 80.00 PROFIT FOR THE COMPANY THAT COULD BE EASILY FIXED USING SOFTER MATERIAL.   *NLM",
