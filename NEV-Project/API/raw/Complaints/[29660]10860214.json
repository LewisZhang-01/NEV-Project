        "summary": "2010 JEEP LIBERTY SPONTANEOUSLY CAUGHT ON FIRE AND EXPLODED ON FRIDAY APRIL 15, 2016.  MY STEPDAD AND I WERE OUT AND WE STOPPED AND PICKED UP A PIZZA ON THE WAY HOME AND EVERYTHING WAS JUST FINE THE WHOLE DRIVE HOME, NO SMELL, NO DRIVING ISSUES, NO SMOKE, NO OVERHEATING DINGS, NO FUNKY SOUNDS.    WE PULLED INTO THE DRIVEWAY TO PARK AND TURNED OFF THE CAR, MY STEPDAD GOT OUT FIRST, AND WHEN I OPENED MY DOOR I SAID 'OOH IT SMELLS LIKE FALL!' (I THOUGHT THE NEIGHBORS WERE HAVING A BONFIRE OR SOMETHING.) THEN I SAW IT AND TOLD HIM 'THE CAR IS SMOKING!' AND I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND GOT AWAY FROM IT. HE TRIED TO OPEN THE HOOD THINKING IT WAS A RADIATOR OR SOMETHING BUT IT WAS SO HOT IT BURNED HIS FINGERS AND THEN HE LIFTED IT A BIT WITH A SCREWDRIVER AS WE WENT TO GET THE FIRE EXTINGUISHER AND WE SAW THE FIRE START SHOOTING OUT OF THE SIDES. IT WAS SO HOT AND SO FAST. I SCREAMED AT HIM TO GET HIM AWAY FROM IT BECAUSE I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO EXPLODE, AND AS SOON AS HE WAS A BIT AWAY FROM IT, THE HOOD DID EXPLODE UP AND THEN IT STARTED REALLY SHOOTING FLAMES OUT AND AND THAT'S WHEN I CALLED 911. THERE WERE SEVERAL MORE EXPLOSIONS WHILE WE WAITED ON THE FIREFIGHTERS.    IT WAS TOTALLY ENGULFED IN FLAMES IN 5 MINUTES. THERE IS NOTHING LEFT BUT A SHELL, AND IT WAS ONE LAYER FROM BURNING OUR HOUSE DOWN. IF WE WERE IN IT ANOTHER 60 SECONDS, WE'D HAVE TAKEN THAT FIRST EXPLOSION TO THE FACES. WE COULD HAVE DIED AND WE ALMOST LOST OUR HOUSE, OUR BARN AND ANOTHER CAR INSIDE THE BARN. I'M FURIOUS. OTHER PEOPLE COULD DIE.",
