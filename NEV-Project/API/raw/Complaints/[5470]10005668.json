AT IDLE, THE LIGHTS ARE FINE.  AS YOU ACCELERATE THE ENGINE, THE LIGHTS FLICKER DOWN.....THEY GET DIM AND FLASH BACK TO NORMAL.    I JUST REPLACED THE BATTERY AND IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE.  IT'S GOT TO BE IN THE ALTERNATOR/VOLTAGE REGUALTOR.    THIS IS A SAFETY DEFECT.  THE LIGHTS ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK LIKE THE LIGHTS ON EVERY OTHER CAR....      IT'LL BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DUPLCATE BECAUSE WHEN THE CAR GETS WARM, THE PROBLEM GOES AWAY.",
