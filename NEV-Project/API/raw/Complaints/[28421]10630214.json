WE USE THIS CAR AS A FAMILY VEHICLE TO TRANSPORT OUR 3 CHILDREN AROUND. WE BOUGHT THIS BRAND NEW AND LOVED IT UNTIL THIS. THESE CARS ARE BUILT LIKE GARBAGE AND ARE SOLD FOR TOP DOLLAR. WHY HASN'T CHRYSLER RECALLED THIS? ARE THEY WAITING FOR PEOPLE TO DIE? THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM ! MAYBE IF SOME OF CHRYSLER'S EXECUTIVES DROVE THESE VEHICLES AND PUT THEIR FAMILIES IN THEM, THE PROBLEMS WOULD BE RESOLVED. SHAME ON CHRYSLER ! SO MUCH FOR BUYING AMERICAN HUH? I HAVE NEVER BOUGHT A IMPORT ! I ALWAYS WAS PROUD DRIVING AMERICAN MADE CARS! BASICALLY THIS CAR IS MEANT TO FAIL ! I AM NOT SO PROUD NOW... THAT'S FOR SURE!  *TR",
