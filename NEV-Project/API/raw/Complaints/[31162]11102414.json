WHEN I RELEASE THE PARKING BRAKE AND BEGIN TO DRIVE, THERE IS A GRINDING NOISE PARTICULARLY IN THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE. WHEN I PRESS THE BRAKE, THE FRONT OF THE CAR SHAKES AND THE BRAKE SEEMS TO KNOCK AS IF IT'S GRIPPING AND THEN RELEASING. VERY SCARY. IT EVENTUALLY HOLDS BUT TAKES A WHILE. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS COULD BE BUT IT SEEMS TO HAPPEN WHEN THE PARKING BRAKE IS USED AND THEN RELEASED. VERY UNSAFE AND SCARY THAT THE DEALER HAS NO IDEA WHAT THE ISSUE IS OR HOW TO RESOLVE IT OR TEST FOR IT! THIS HAPPENS WHEN IN MOTION AND DOES NOT HAPPEN EVERY TIME.",
