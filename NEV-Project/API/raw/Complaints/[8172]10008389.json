THERE WERE NO PRIOR INDICATIONS THAT A PROBLEM EXISTED WITH THE STEERING. THE DEALER HAS INFORMED ME THAT THE STEERING GEAR (RACK AND PINION) NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. WITH ONLY 52,000 MILES OF MOSTLY HIGHWAY DRIVING I LOGGED ONTO THE NHTSA WEB SITE TO SEE IF THIS IS A COMMON COMPLAINT AMONG INTRIGUE OWNERS. IT APPEARS IT IS. IN CALLING TO SOLICIT REDUCED PRICES FOR THIS $1200+ BILL A NUMBER OF DEALERS ADMITTED THAT THIS WAS NOT AN UNCOMMON PROBLEM WITH INTRIGUES AND THAT IT MOST OFTEN AFFECTED LEFT TURNS. A SAFE STEERING MECHANISM IS NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD WEAR OUT WITH ONLY 52,000 MILES AND THE SUDDEN NATURE OF THE FAILURE, ALSO A COMMON COMPLAINT IN YOUR WEB SITE, IS VERY CONCERNING.   *NLM",
