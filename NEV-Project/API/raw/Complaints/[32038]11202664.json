THESE SYMPTOMS WERE IDENTICAL TO AN ISSUE SHE HAD WITH THIS VEHICLE IN 2017 THAT NECESSITATED A TOW TO DARRELL WALTRIP HONDA IN FRANKLIN TN FOR REPAIR, AND SIMILAR TO LESS SEVERE EPISODES OF HESITANT ACCELERATION BOTH SHE AND I HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH THE VEHICLE SINCE AT LEAST 2016. GRASSLAND CAR CARE CENTER IN FRANKLIN TN DIAGNOSED THE SPARK PLUGS WERE OIL FOULED CAUSING A MISFIRE.  ENGINE CODES P0301, P0302, P0303, P0304, AND P0300 RESULTED FROM THE INCIDENT.  WE HAVE SINCE LEARNED THIS IS A KNOWN DEFECT WITH THIS MODEL OF HONDA AND THAT THE VCM-2 CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT RESULTED IN A WARRANTY EXTENSION OF EIGHT YEARS FROM PURCHASE DATE. WE HAVE AN OPEN CASE WITH HONDA OF AMERICA (CASE MANAGER: ZOE; CASE #09478660), BUT ARE BEING TOLD THAT OUR VEHICLE IS OUTSIDE THE EXTENDED EIGHT YEAR WARRANTY BY FOUR MONTHS.  WE CONTEND THIS VEHICLE WAS EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS CONSISTENT WITH THE WARRANTIED ISSUE WELL BEFORE THE 4/5/19 FAILURE, TO INCLUDE THE SAME TYPE OF EPISODE SUPPOSEDLY REPAIRED BY DARRELL WALTRIP HONDA ON 5/1/17.  THE SUDDEN INABILITY TO ACCELERATE ON A ROADWAY IS A CONSIDERABLE SAFETY CONCERN.  WE ARE QUESTIONING WHY THIS WASN'T A SAFETY RECALL ITEM.  WE HAVE ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION AVAILABLE IF NEEDED.",
