        "summary": "THULE UTILITY TRAILER IS EQUIPPED WITH BAD SAFETY CHAINS. THE CHAIN IS MADE OF PLASTIC COATED STEEL CABLE WITH THE CRIMMPED COUPLINGS. I PULLED THE CHAIN WITH MY HAND AND IT CAME APART. THIS CHAIN SUPPOSE TO KEEP TRAILER ATTACHED TO THE VEHICLE IN CASE IT LOOSES BALL CONNECTION. TRAILER IS DESIGNED TO CARRY 1300 POUNDS OF CARGO LOAD, SO THE CABLE SHOULD BE MADE MUCH MORE DURABLE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT CABLE WAS CRIMPED OVER PLASTIC COATING THAT IS THE BIGGEST CABLE HANDLING VIOLATION. E-TRAILER, THAT SOLD ME THULE 205 UTILITY TRAILER SENT A REPLACEMENT CABLE THAT WAS MADE EXACTLY THE SAME WAY. I WAS POINTING OUT THIS PROBLEM TO CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER JULY, BUT SHE WAS WONDERING WHY ONLY MY CABLE BROKE, BUT NO ONE ELSE COMPLAINED. I TRIED TO EXPLAIND HER THAT IF SOME ONE HAS TO RELAY ON SAFETY CABLE, THESE CABLE WILL FAIL AND THEY WILL HAVE LAW SUITS. I AM THE ENGINEER THAT WORKS WITH CABLES AND I KNOW THAT EVERY MANUFACTURER OF COATED CABLE PUTS NOTES WARNING DO NOT CRIM ANYTHING OVER PLASTIC COATING AS IT WILL NOT WORK. APPEARS THULE CAN NOT READ INSTRUCTIONS, OR THEY ARE NOT TARNSLATED IN TO CHINESE WHERE TRAILERS ARE MADE. THEY SOLD A LOTS OF TRAILERS AND LOOKS LIKE EVERY ONE HAS THIS HIDDEN PROBLEM. I MADE MY OWN CABLES NOT WAITING FOR SOMETHING BAD TO HAPPEN.",
