SMELL HAD NOT BEEN NOTICEABLE ALL OF THE TIME AND IS NOW WORSE, CAN ALSO SMELL INSIDE CAR AS WELL AS OUTSIDE. TO THIS DAY STILL NOT SEEING ANY LEAKS UNDER CAR HAVE BEEN PARKING OVER CARDBOARD LARGER THAN THE CAR HAVE ALSO CHECKED UNDER THE HOOD AND NOT SEEING ANYTHING. TODAY BECAME SICK FROM THE STRENGTH OF GASOLINE TO THE POINT OF VOMITING. AFTER READING TONIGHT THAT OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR INCIDENTS, FEEL IT IS NECESSARY TO REPORT THIS ISSUE AS I DO LIVE IN A VERY HOT AND HUMID LOCATION THAT IS NOT PART OF THE LISTED STATES THAT CHEVROLET IS ALLOWING FOR THIS RECALL, THAT IS UNJUST. LOOKS LIKE CHEVROLET NEEDS TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE BEFORE PEOPLE START DYING FOR SOMETHING THEY ARE CLEARLY AWARE OF, AGAIN!  *TR",
