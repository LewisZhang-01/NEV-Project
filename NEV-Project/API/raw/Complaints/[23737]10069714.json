        "summary": "I'M A HEARING IMPAIRED DRIVER/OWNER OF FORD '95 CONTOUR GL (LOW-INCOMER, AVERAGE $21,000 A YEAR).  I'VE BOUGHT THIS CAR IN 1997 FROM A MINNEAPOLIS-AREA FORD DEALERSHIP (QUALITY AUTO DEALERSHIP IN BLOOMINGTON, MINNESOTA). AT THE TIME, I HAD LESS THAN $10,000 TO PAY FOR A RECENT USED CAR(ONE THAT IS WITHIN 2-3 YEARS AFTER IT CAME ON THE MARKET). I TRIED OUT FEW CARS AND THE WHITE 1995 FORD CONTOUR GL. THE DEALER INSISTED THAT '95 FORD CONTOUR GL WAS A GOOD BUY AT AN AFFORDABLE PRICE.  I WAS WILLING TO TRADE UP MY OLD CAR TO REDUCE THE PRICE BUT IT WAS STILL TOO HIGH FOR ME SINCE IT DIDN'T INCLUDED OTHER FEES LIKE THE TITLE AND REGISTRATION LICENSE. AFTER A SHORT, PERSUASIVE NEGOTIATION, I GOT THE DEALER TO AGREE TO MARK DOWN TO $9995 AND I ACCEPTED THAT. SO I BOUGHT THE CAR.  AFTER A FEW DAYS, I WAS EXPERIENCING A PROBLEM WITH IT, SO I HAD IT TOWED BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND LATER TOLD ME THAT THE WHOLE ENGINE WAS BAD AND NEED TO BE REPLACED. I WAS STUNNED BUT THEY WERE WILLING TO DO THE REPAIR FOR FREE. IT TOOK ME A WEEK TO GET MY CAR BACK. EVERYTHING WENT FAIRLY FINE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. IN 1999, THE AIR-CONDITIONER IN MY CAR STOPPED WORKING AND IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE TO REPAIR AT THE TIME. I MOVED TO COLUMBUS, OH IN JAN. 2000. FOR THE LAST 3 YEARS, THAT CAR HAS BECOME A TROUBLE FOR ME. ONE REPAIR AFTER THE NEXT. THE BIGGEST REPAIR COST I'VE PAID OUT WAS $2060.43 TO REPLACE A FLYWHEEL.  I HAVE TRIED TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY CAR BY TAKING IT TO JIFFY LUBE FOR OIL/CHECK-UPS EVERY 3-6 MONTHS FAITHFULLY AND I'M STILL HAVING TROUBLE WITH MY CAR. RIGHT NOW, IT IS AT ANOTHER FORD SERVICE BECAUSE THERE MAY BE DEFECTED WIRING COILS IN MY CAR (A DEALER RECALL THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF). I HAVE KEPT ALL THE SERVICE MAINTENANCE PAPERS IN FILE FOR ALL THE REPAIRS AND SERVICES ON MY CAR. I WANTED A NEW CAR AND I'M NOT VERY HAPPY. I'M TIRED OF PAYING FOR THE REPAIRS.
