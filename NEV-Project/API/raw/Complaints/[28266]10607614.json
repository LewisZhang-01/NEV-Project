AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF INVESTIGATION WE REALIZED THAT OUR KNEES WERE IN PERFECT RANGE TO HIT THE KEY FOB/CHAIN AND FIGURED OUT THAT THE IGNITION HAD BEEN TURNED TO THE ACCESSORY POSITION. THE VEHICLE IMMEDIATELY STARTED AFTER WE FIGURED THIS OUT. THIS HAS HAPPENED A COMBINED 6 TIMES BETWEEN BOTH DRIVERS OF THE VEHICLE, ONE WHO IS 5'1\" AND THE OTHER WHO IS 5'8\" TALL. UNFORTUNATELY EXACT DATES FOR ALL OCCURRENCES ARE UNAVAILABLE OR WOULD BE ROUGH ESTIMATES, BUT HAS OCCURRED AS RECENTLY AS APRIL 10 2014. WE DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WE COULD FILE A COMPLAINT REGARDING THIS ISSUE UNTIL JUST RECENTLY WHEN SEARCHING FOR RECALLS FOR THIS VEHICLE, OTHERWISE WE WOULD HAVE DONE SO IN THE PAST.   *TR",
