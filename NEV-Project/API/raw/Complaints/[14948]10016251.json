I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF MAKING A RIGHT TURN IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC, AND MY ENGINE QUIT - THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, POWER STEERING AND POWER BRAKES WERE OFF SO IT MADE THE CAR INCREDIBLY HEAVY TO TURN. I WAS ABLE TO COAST INTO A PARKING LOT WITHOUT GETTING HIT, BUT IT WAS STILL TERRIFYING. I TURNED THE KEY OFF, AND STARTED THE CAR RIGHT BACK UP, DROVE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP A MILE AWAY WHERE IT'S BEEN AWAITING A \"SOFTWARE UPGRADE\" FOR 5 DAYS.  ON WWW.EDMUNDS.COM I FOUND THAT SEVERAL OWNERS OF 2003 SAAB 9-3S HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING. HOW DANGEROUS! *JB",
