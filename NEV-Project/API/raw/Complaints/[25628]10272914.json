LOCATED WEBSITE WITH OVER 100 ENTRIES OF CUSTOMERS STATING SAME PROBLEM. DODGE REFUSES TO ADMIT THERE IS A PROBLEM OR SAFETY ISSUE. REMOVED AND RE-INSERTED OID FUSE TO TEMPORARILY CORRECT PROBLEM FOR A FEW HOURS. THEN LOCKS FAIL TO OPERATE AGAIN. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE & DODGE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO CORRECT IT. ON THE DISCUSSION FORUM HUNDREDS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND DEALERS DO NOT HAVE A SOLUTION EITHER. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE THIS FAILURE ALLOWS DOORS TO BE OPENED BY CHILDREN. IF THIS IS NOT ADDRESSED THERE WILL BE LAW SUITES DUE TO INJURIES TO THOSE FALLING OUT OF VANS. *TR",
