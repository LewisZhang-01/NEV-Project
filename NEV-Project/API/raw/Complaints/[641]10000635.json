I GOT THE TRUCK STOPPED BEFORE WE WENT OVER A SEVERAL HUNDRED FOOT DROP. I HAD MY WIFE, 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER, AND 6 MONTH OLD SON IN THE TRUCK WITH ME. I GOT THE STEERING UNLOCKED AND DROVE HOME. I TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAID SINCE THEY CAN NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM THEY WILL NOT FIX OR REPLACE ANYTHING IN THE FRONT END OR STEERING WITHOUT DUPLICATING THE PROBLEM. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING A TRUCK THAT HAS DONE THIS. I USALLY HAVE MY CHILDREN WITH ME IN A TRUCK THAT IS UNSAFE. I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT HE WILL NOT AUTHORIZE ANY REPAIR WITHOUT DUPLICATION. I ASKED HIM WHY HE WOULD SEND A TRUCK OUT THAT WAS UNSAFE. ALL HE COULD SAY WAS I CARE BUT NO REPAIRS WITHOUT DUPLICATION. I CONACTED GM AND I AM WAITING A REPLY.",
