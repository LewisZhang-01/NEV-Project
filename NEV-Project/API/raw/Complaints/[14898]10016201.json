HE DISCOVERED THE FUEL PUMP WIRING WAS HEATING UP TO THE POINT IT CAUSED A BARE LINE. HIS OPINION WAS,  I WAS VERY FORTUNATE THE VEHICLE STALLED SINCE THE PUMP IS LOCATED IN THE FUEL TANK AND IS A BOMB WAITING TO EXPLODE. I NOTED MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED. ARE WE AWAITING ANOTHER FORD ESCORT SITUATION BEFORE CHEVY NEEDS TO FILE A RECALL BEFORE SOME ONE DIES? I HAVE RETAINED THE PUMP SHOULD YOU WISH TO HAVE AN EXPERT LOOK AT THE SITUATION.  *JB",
