FIRST MY CAR HAS BEEN RUNNING HOT CONTINUOUSLY OVER THIS PERIOD OF TIME WHICH CAUSES ME TO HAVE TO PUT COOLANT IN AT LEAST ONCE EVERY MONTH.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME THIS WAS COMMON WITH THE EXPLORERS BUT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A RECALL SO I WOULD HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET.  THEY FIRST TOLD ME IT WAS THE LINE TO THE RADIATOR THAT WAS LEAKING SO I HAD IT REPLACED, THEN NEXT TIME IT WAS THE THERMOSTAT AND HOUSING THAT THEY SAID WAS THE PROBLEM. SO I HAD THIS REPLACED.  NOW TODAY 9/19/2013 I HAD TO REPLACE THE RADIATOR. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I SEEM TO FIX THIS PROBLEM CONTINUES TO OCCUR.  SECONDLY MY CAR JERKS INTO GEAR WHEN I TRY TO PUT IN GEAR.
