LIP THEN SPILLS ONTO THE EXHAUST HEADER.  HUGE HUGE FIRE HAZARD.  THIS MUST BE RECALLED.  CALLED MY CHRYSLER DEALER AND THEY SAY THERE IS NO KNOWN RECALL ON THIS AND WOULD NOT HONOR A FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM.  HOW MANY LIVES AND VEHICLES MUST BE LOST BEFORE SOMEONE FORCES CHRYSLER TO RECALL AND FIX THIS.   THIS WILL BE THE LAST CHRYSLER I OWN.    *NLM    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*753523",
