        "summary": "IGNITION COIL FAILURE.  RECEIVED LETTER FROM AUDI ON MARCH 3, 2003 REGARGING RECOGNIZED IGNITION COIL FAILURES.  AUDI INDICATED SIGNIFICANT FAILURES WITH IGNITION COILS AND PROMISED THAT IN THE EVENT OF IGNITION COIL FAILURE ALL REPAIRS WOULD BE FREE.  ON MARCH 11, 2002, I WENT TO DEALER FOR A REGULARLY SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE AT 11,000 MILES.  I ASKED THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TO REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE COILS EVEN THOUGH I HAD YET TO EXPERIENCE ANY TROUBLE.  I WAS INFORMED THAT AUDI WOULD NOT REPLACE THE COILS UNTIL ACTUAL VEHICLE FAILURE.  APPROXIMATELY TWO WEEKS LATER, THE COILS FAILED AND MY CAR DIED ON THE ROAD IN ZERO DEGREE WEATHER.  AFTER A 90 MINUTE WAIT, AUDI ROADSIDE SERVICE ARRIVED AND TOOK MY CAR BY FLAT-BED TO DEALER.  I HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE THAT ONLY THE DEFECTIVE COILS WILL BE REPLACED.  MY VEHICLE HAS SIX COILS.  THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE INDICATED THAT ALL COILS WILL BE REPLACED ONLY WHEN THE CAR IS IN FOR A SECOND COIL FAILURE.  THE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT A SECOND COIL FAILURE IS GUARANTEED.  THE OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THIS WEBSITE APPEAR TO BEAR THIS OUT.  THE NHSTB SHOULD DEMAND AN IMMEDIATE RECALL OF THESE DEFECTIVE IGNITION COILS.  AUDI HAS BEEN AWARE OF THIS VEHICLE SAFETY ISSUE FOR MONTHS AND APPEARS TO BE QUITE CONTENT TO LET ITS CUSTOMERS CONTINUE TO BEAR THE RISK OF A CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENT.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY COMPLAINTS OF THIS NATURE MUST BE WRITTEN BEFORE THE NHTSA TAKES ACTION?     *JB",
