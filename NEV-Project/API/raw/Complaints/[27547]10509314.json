LATER FOUND OUT THAT A CLIP FOR THE TRANSMISSION COOLER HOUSE HAD FAILED WHICH ALLOWED ALL TRANSMISSION FLUID TO SPILL OUT.  WAS LUCKY THAT I WAS ON A RURAL ROAD WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND NOT ENTERING INTO HIGHWAY TRAFFIC OR ELSE ACCIDENT WOULD SURELY HAPPEN.      FOUND OUT FROM DEALER THAT THERE WAS A BULLETIN TO REPLACE THE CLIPS AS THEY WERE NOT UP TO SPEC TO HANDLE THE PRESSURE.  I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED BY NISSAN ON THIS DEFECT AND IT OCCURRED BEFORE I EVEN HAD MY FIRST SERVICE.  NOW I'M LEFT WITH TO ME A COMPROMISED TRANSMISSION WHICH NISSAN REFUSE TO REPLACE.  THEY ONLY REFILL THE FLUID AND SAID IT WAS OK.  THIS IS MY FAMILY VEHICLE WHICH I USE TO TRANSPORT MY 4YR AND 1YR OLD. *TR",
