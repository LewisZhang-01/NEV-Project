        "summary": "I OWN A 1992 FORD F-150 EXTEND CAB TRUCK. ON 6-13-03 WHILE DRIVING ON THE INDIANA TOLL ROAD THE BACK RIGHT TIRE SHEARED OFF ALL THE WHEEL STUDS INSTANTLY. FORTUNATELY THE TIRE DID NOT FALL OFF TILL AFTER THE TRUCK WAS PULLED OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND WE WERE GOING VERY SLOWLY. THE MECHANICS OPINION WHO EVALUATE THE TRUCK SAID NO OTHER MECHANICAL PROBLEMS WERE DETECTED OTHER THAN THE WHEEL STUDS SHEARING OFF TO CAUSE THIS ACCIDENT. I HAVE KEPT THE DAMAGED WHEEL STUDS AND HAD ALL WHEEL STUDS REPLACED ON THE TRUCK. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM TO WARN OTHERS OF THE POSSIBLE TROUBLE. HOPEFULLY YOU WILL PREVENT SERIOUS ACCIDENTS. WE WERE FORTUNATE THAT OURS ENDED WITHOUT A SERIOUS CONSEQUENCE. I HAVE LISTED THE NUMBER OF FAILURES TO BE 5 SINCE ALL THE STUDS SHEARED OFF. 911 WAS CALLED BUT NO STATE OFFICER RESPONDED TO THE INCIDENT. A 911 CALL SHOULD BE ON TAPE.  *NLM",
