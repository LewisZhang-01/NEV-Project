THIS PIECE IS APPROXIMATELY ONE OUNCE AT MOST AND IT BROKE WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS UNOCCUPIED AND NOT ON AN INCLINE. HAD THE VEHICLE BEEN ON A HILL, IT WOULD HAVE GREATLY INCREASED THE CHANCES OF INJURIES AND/OR FATALITIES. WHEN I CONTACTED SATURN, I WAS ADVISED THAT THE REPAIR WOULD COST $250 AND THAT IT WAS COMMON ENOUGH TO WHICH IT HAD BEEN SEEN MULTIPLE TIMES BY THE MECHANICAL REPRESENTATIVE TO WHICH I WAS SPEAKING. I WAS FURTHER ADVISED THAT SINCE AN EMERGENCY BREAK IS NOT A SAFETY MECHANISM, IT WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO A RECALL OR A RECALL RELATED INVESTIGATION.*AK",
