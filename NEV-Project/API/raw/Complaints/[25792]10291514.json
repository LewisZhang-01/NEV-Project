I NOTIFIED MY LOCAL DEALER ON SEPT 10, 2009 AND THE VEHICLE WAS SERVICED ON SEPTEMBER 11.  THE DIAGNOSE WAS A FAULTY 'FRONTAL SENSOR'.  ON OCTOBER 31, 2009 THE 'SERVICE BRAKE SYSTEM' DISPLAYED AND THE ABS LIGHT WOULD NOT GO OUT ON THE SAME VEHICLE.  THIS WAS ACCOMPANIED ALONG WITH AN ANNOYING REPEATING BEEP SOUND.  I CONTACTED MY LOCAL DEALER AGAIN AND INFORMED OF THE PROBLEM.  AFTER SEVERAL STOPPING AND RESTARTING OF THE ENGINE THE LIGHTS WENT OUT.  ON NOVEMBER 8, MY 'SERVICE AIR BAG' MESSAGE DISPLAYED MULTIPLE TIMES THROUGH OUT THE DAY.  THE TRUCK IS SCHEDULED FOR ANOTHER SERVICE APPOINTMENT.  IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM?*TR",
