THE PRESSURE SWITCH ON THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM HAD PARTIALLY FAILED.  (PART WAS REPLACED AND SEEMED FINE)  WHILE DRIVING THE CONSUMER SMELLED SOMETHING BURNING,  HE STOPPED AND CHECKED THE VEHICLE BUT DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING.  THE CONSUMER ATTEMPTED TO START THE VEHICLE BUT IT WOULD NOT MOVE.  THE DEALER CHECKED THE HYDRAULIC RESERVOIR TO THE AUTO PARK EMERGENCY BRAKE SYSTEM AND FOUND IT WAS NEARLY EMPTY DUE TO THE SWITCH LEAKING.  (THE CONSUMER THOUGHT HE COULD GET HOME BUT THE PROBLEM REPEATED)  THE SWITCH WAS REPLACED AGAIN AND THERE WAS NO AUTO PARK EMERGENCY LIGHT.  *SCC  *JB  THE EXAMINATION OF THE COMPLAINT VEHICLE DISCLOSED THAT THE PROBLEMS WERE SOLEY RELATED TO IMPROPER ADJUSTMENT OF THE SYSTEMS OR WORN PARKING BRAKE SHOES. A DEFECT SAFETY TREND WAS NOT IDENTIFIED. GENERAL MOTORS CORPORATION AGREED TO SEND A SAFETY ADVISORY LETTER TO ALL OWNERS OF THESE VEHICLES. *CB",
