BRAKE PEDAL AND ACCELERATOR PEDAL ARE POSITIONED TOO CLOSE, AND WHEN BRAKE PEDAL IS ALL THE WAY DOWN, FOOT COMES IN CONTACT WITH ACCELERATOR PEDAL, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP! THIS IS APPARENTLY A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THESE GMC PICKUPS, AS I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH A 1991 GMC SONOMA. IN THIS CASE, I COULD HAVE AVOIDED A COLLISION, BUT COULD NOT STOP, EVEN THOUGH I HAD APPLIED THE BRAKES WITH PLENTY OF FORCE. GM SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MAJOR DEFECT, WHICH WAS NOT CORRECTED FROM AT LEAST 1991 THROUGH 1997 -- AND PROBABLY BEYOND!        *JS",
