SHIFTED INTO PARK, THEN REVERSE AGAIN - STILL DID NOT GO INTO GEAR. SHIFTED INTO PARK AND THEN DRIVE, AND THE CAR PROCEEDED TO ROLL BACKWARDS DOWN THE DRIVEWAY (OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T GO INTO GEAR). SHIFTED INTO PARK, THEN REVERSE AND IT FINALLY TOOK. THIS HAS HAPPENED 3 TIMES IN THE PAST WEEK. THIS CAR IS ONLY DRIVEN TO AND FROM WORK - WITH NOT MUCH STARTING AND STOPPING. THIS SEEMS LIKE A PREMATURE FAILURE FOR THESE TWO PARTS.",
