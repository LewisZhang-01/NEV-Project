THIS COULD BE A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS SITUATION DEPENDING WHERE YOU ARE WHEN CAR WILL NOT START.  I HAD A SMALL CHILD WITH ME ON THE WAY TO THE DOCTOR AND MADE A STOP AT THE DRUG STORE, THEN TRIED TO RESTART CAR TO PROCEED TO DOCTOR AND CAR WOULD NOT START.  SINCE I ONLY RECENTLY ACQUIRED THIS CAR, I HAVE DONE RESEARCH ON THIS PROBLEM AND SEE THAT IT IS A BIG PROBLEM WITH CHEVY MALIBUS.  WHY ISN'T THERE A RECALL FOR THIS--OR, IF THERE IS ONE, PLEASE ADVISE.  *TR",
