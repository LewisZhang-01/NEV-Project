I STARTED TO PULL FROM THE PARKING SPACE AND IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO STOP. I PARKED AND HAD MY CAR TAKEN TO A REPAIR SHOP. THE BRAKE LINE WAS RUSTED THROUGH. THE MECHANIC SAID THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED TO A CAR WITH ONLY 69,000 MILES ON IT AND WAS A POOR DESIGN AS THE BRAKE LINE RUNS OVER THE WHEEL WELL. HE SAID THERE ARE OTHERS THAT WILL ALSO FAIL SOON. I AM GOING TO HAVE THEM ALL REPLACED. MY PARKING BRAKE CABLE ALSO BROKE A FEW WEEKS AGO. LUCKILY THIS DID NOT CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. *TR",
