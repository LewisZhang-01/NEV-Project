AFTER THE GAS TANK IS FULL, THE GAUGE FLUCTUATES BACK AND FORTH (SOMETIMES THE GAUGE READS NEAR EMPTY, SOMETIMES THE GAUGE READS 3/4 OF THE TANK FULL) WHEN OPERATING THE VEHICLE.  3) THE CAR DID NOT PASS THE CALIFORNIA SMOG TEST.  4) THE RPM GAUGE DOES NOT STAY CONSTANT WHILE DRIVING AT AN EVEN SPEED. ONCE THE GAUGE HITS BETWEEN TWO TO THREE THOUSAND RPM, THE GAUGE DROPS BACK TO BETWEEN ONE AND TWO THOUSAND RPM ON AND OF WHEN DRIVING.  5) THE GAS TANK DOES NOT MAINTAIN PRESSURE EVEN THOUGH THE LID WAS SCREWED ON TIGHT.  THE LID WAS REPLACED WITH A NEW ONE BUT THIS PROBLEM STILL OCCURS.    ALL THESE ISSUES OCCUR WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON.  THE DEALER DOES NOT WANT TO LOOK AT THESE ISSUES WITHOUT HAVING ME PAY THEM TO LOOK AT MY CAR. THESE ISSUES MY CAR HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING HAVE BEEN ON AND OFF SINCE 2001 TO PRESENT.  THE PROBLEMS SEEM TO GET WORSE.",
