VERY EXPENSIVE!!  NOW THE CAR STALLS WHEN SLOWING DOWN.    EVERY MORNING WHEN I LEAVE FOR WORK IT STALLS AT LEAST ONCE, IT HAS STARTED BACK UP, BUT THIS MORNING THE MOTOR FELT VERY GROGGY AND I DID NOT FEEL SAFE IN DRIVING IT ANYMORE.  TOOK IT HOME.  I'VE BROUGHT IT TO MECHANICS AND IT NEVER DIES FOR THEM AND THEY CAN NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT, DID IT TWO MORE TIMES AFTER THAT, TAKING IT TONIGHT TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIGURE IT OUT.   THIS IS EXTREMELY UNSAFE!!  IT DIED THE FIRST TIME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET!  I WAS SO AFRAID SOMEONE WAS GOING TO RUN INTO THE BACK OF ME!  THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM AND ALL OVER THE INTERNET WITH OTHER SANTA FE OWNERS FOR THIS YEAR.  I WANT HYUNDAI TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND RECALL THESE CARS!  THEY ARE UNSAFE!!!",
