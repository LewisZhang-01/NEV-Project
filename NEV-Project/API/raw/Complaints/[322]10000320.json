MY CAR IS A 1994 HONDA CIVIC DX COUPE WITH ABOUT 116,000 MILES ON IT. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS OUT OF THE BASIC WARRANTY, BUT THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE THAT HAS TO DO WITH NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR. MY WINDSHIELD IS PERFECTLY FINE OTHERWISE AND NOTHING HIT MY CAR WHEN IT HAPPENED NOR DID I RUN OVER SOMETHING THAT MAY OF JOLTED MY CAR. I CALLED HONDA AND THEY DENIED MY CLAIM SAYING ONLY SEAT BELTS HAVE UNLIMITED WARRANTY. TS",
