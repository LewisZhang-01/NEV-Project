        "summary": "THIS COMPLAINT IS TO REPLACE PREVIOUS COMPLAINT #10023062.  I AM SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE, I FEEL THAT I MAY HAVE LEFT OUT PERTINENT INFORMATION.  MY VEHICLE WAS LEAKING FUEL FROM THE FUEL TANK PIPE GROMMET.  I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO ANOTHER AUTO REPAIR SERVICE RATHER THAN THE DEALER WHERE I HAD BOUGHT IT.  THIS AUTO REPAIR SERVICE INFORMED ME OF RECALL 00V350000.  I THEN TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE FROM.  I HAD TOLD THEM ABOUT THE RECALL THAT I HAD LEARNED ABOUT. THEY INFORMED ME THAT THIS RECALL WAS NOT FOR MY PARTICULAR VEHICLE.  I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEALERSHIP DOES NOT HAVE MY PARTICULAR VEHICLE ON RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, IT SEEMS A BIG COINCIDENCE THAT SOME OTHER 2000 FORD CONTOUR VEHICLES DO AND I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM, YET MY VEHICLE IS NOT ON THE RECALL LIST.  MAYBE THERE ARE MORE THAT DO NEED TO BE RECALLED?  I DON'T FEEL THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR WHEN IT MAY BE A MANUFACTURING PROBLEM.  THEY HAVE ORDERED THE PART FOR THE CAR TO REPAIR IT AND WE WILL PAY THE BILL FOR REPAIR.  BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THIS INVESTIGATED AND MAYBE WE CAN BE REIMBURSED FOR THE REPAIR IF IT IS FOUND THAT MY VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE RECALL LIST.  I TRUST THE DEALER AND DO NOT WISH FOR THEM TO BE REPRIMANDED FOR THIS.  I JUST WANT THIS TO BE INVESTIGATED SO OTHERS LIKE MYSELF TO GO THROUGH THE WONDERING AND SUSPICION.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE AND PATIENCE.   *NLM",
