THE DEALER TESTED MY CAR AND DETERMINED THAT THE IGNITION COILS WERE BAD.  THEY HAD TO REPLACE ALL 6 AT $100+ EACH BECAUSE THEY HAD NO WAY TO TELL WHICH OF THE 6 WERE BAD.  IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ALL 6 WERE BAD BECAUSE THE CAR WOULD STILL START AND RUN, ONLY HAVING PROBLEMS INTERMITTENTLY.  I FIND IT APPALLING THAT I WAS FORCED TO PAY FOR 6 PARTS PLUS LABOR WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DETERMINE IF ALL OF THE PARTS TRULY NEEDED REPLACING.",
