WE TOOK IT TO THE LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER IN OUR AREA (KENDALL TOYOTA IN MIAMI FLORIDA).  WE TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT IS LISTED ON YOUR WEB SITE AS KNOWN DEFECT IN OUR CAR'S MODEL AND YEAR.  HOWEVER THEY REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.  WE ENDED UP SPENDING $2896.62 AT THE DEALERSHIP SHOP TO FIX THE ENGINE PROBLEM.  CONSIDERING THAT PROBLEM IS A KNOWN DEFECT AS PUBLISHED ON THIS WEB SITE.  IS THERE A WAY YOUR OFFICE CAN HELP US RECOVER SOME OR ALL OF OUR MONEY THAT WAS CHARGED BY THE DEALER INAPPROPRIATELY.   *NLM",
