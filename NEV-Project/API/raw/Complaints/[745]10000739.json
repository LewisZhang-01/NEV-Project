I TOOK IT TO THE FIRESTONE STORE AND HE SAID A PLUG WAS AN INCORRECT AND UNSAFE WAY TO REPAIR THE TIRE.  I THEN TOOK IT TO A GOODYEAR STORE AND HE TOLD ME THE SAME THING.    I RETURNED TO THE HONDA DEALER AND TOLD HIM MY SITUATION; WHEREUPON HE SAID THE TIRE PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO SELL MORE TIRES AND EVERYONE KNOWS PLUG REPAIRS ARE THE MOST EFFICEINT WAY TO REPAIR A PUNCTURE BY A NAIL.    CAN YOU COMMENT ON THE HONDA DEALER'S REMARKS?  ARE THERE ANY REGULATIONS BY THE NHTSA ABOUT REPAIRS TO A TIRE WITH A PLUG?  YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS QUESTION IS GREATLY APPRECIATED.    HAROLD V.WEBB",
