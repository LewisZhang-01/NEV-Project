        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING ON A MIXTURE OF LIGHT SNOW AND ICE AND NOTICED ABS ENGAGING WHEN IT SHOULDN'T, CAUSING ME TO ALMOST SLIDE INTO AN INTERSECTION. I HADN'T LOST TRACTION AND WOULD FEEL THE SYSTEM ENGAGE THROUGH THE BRAKE PEDAL. IT WOULD COME ON VERY HARD AND ACTUALLY CAUSE ME TO START SLIDING INSTEAD OF ASSISTING WITH BRAKING. IN ICY CONDITIONS, IT FEELS LIKE SUBARU'S ABS IS VERY \"HEAVY HANDED\" IN IT'S APPLICATION AND OVERLY SENSITIVE IN IT'S DEPLOYMENT. I WAS IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE CAR UNTIL THE SYSTEM ENGAGED SUDDENLY ON A DOWNHILL LEADING TO A STOP SIGN. THIS OCCURRED THE FOLLOWING DAY AT A STOP LIGHT. RELEASING THE BRAKES COMPLETELY WAS THE ONLY WAY TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. IN BOTH INSTANCES, I WAS TRAVELING BETWEEN 5 AND 30 MILES PER HOUR, LEAVING MYSELF PLENTY OF ROOM TO STOP. I WANT TO REITERATE THAT BOTH TIMES, I HAD GRIP AND WAS SLOWING JUST FINE UNTIL ABS ENGAGED AND STARTED A SLIDE. THE ONLY THING KEEPING ME FROM GETTING INTO A WRECK WAS A LUCKY LIGHT CHANGE. (THE 2ND TIME) AND THE DISTANCE I GAVE MYSELF TO STOP. (THE 1ST TIME) THIS ISSUE IS BAD ENOUGH THAT I'M CONSIDERING PULLING THE ABS FUSE THE NEXT TIME I HAVE TO DRIVE IN SNOW OR ICE.",
