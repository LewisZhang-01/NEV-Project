I CHECKED TO FIND THE U JOINTS ON STEERING SHAFT WHERE RUSTED SO I LUBED WITH OIL. STEERING BECAME MUCH BETTER. I WENT TO A LOCAL FORD DEALER THEY SAID THERE WAS NO RECALLS AND KNEW OF NO PROBLEMS WITH THE STEERING ON THE F150'S. THE FORD DEALER WANTED ME TO LET THEM TAKE EVERYTHING APART BUT SAID IT COULD RUN INTO A LOT OF MONEY DEPENDING ON WHAT THEY FIND. SO FOR OVER THREE YEARS I'VE BEEN OILING THE JOINTS ON THE SHAFT AND LIVING WITH THE PROBLEM. WAITING FOR TOTAL FAILURE TO SUE FORD FOR POOR DESIGN OF THE STEERING COLUMN SHAFT JOINTS.  *TR",
