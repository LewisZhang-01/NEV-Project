I RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND SPOKE WITH THE SALES PERSON,SALES MANAGER & SERVICE MANAGER AND AFTER COMPARING OTHER SABLES OF 2003 IN THE LOT, ALL STATED IN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AS HAVING THE TINT BUT SOME DID NOT APPEAR AS HAVING THE DARKER BAND RUNNING ACROSS THE TOP OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD. NO ONE COULD ADDRESS THIS AS TO WHY SOME DID OR DID NOT OTHER THAN THEY WERE DIFFERENT SUPPLY VENDORS FORD USED THAT DAY. IT APPEARS THAT WHOMEVER FORD SUPPLIER ARE AT THIS POINT HAS A PROCESS ERROR IN THE MANUFACTURING APPLICATION OF THE TINT PROCESS SINCE FORD DEALERSHIP MANAGEMENT COULD NOT ANSWER OR WILLING TO FIND OUT THE ANSWERS TO THE PROBLEM.      *NLM",
