        "summary": "I DRIVE A 2007 TOYOTA FJ CRUISER. I'VE OWNED THE VEHICLE SINCE AUGUST 2006. TWO TIMES SINCE I'VE OWNED THE VEHICLE, IT HAS ACCELERATED UNEXPECTEDLY.  EACH TIME, IT HAS TAKEN ME OFF GUARD. ONE TIME I WAS IN A 35 MPH ZONE AND IT GOT UP TO 50 OR 60 MPH.  IN BOTH INCIDENTS, I SWITCHED THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL AND THE ENGINE CONTINUED TO REV.  I WAITED FOR THE ENGINE TO RETURN TO NORMAL BEFORE PUTTING IT BACK INTO DRIVE. BOTH TIMES, I THINK I WAS GOING A SLOW ENOUGH SPEED THAT THE BRAKE HELPED SLOW THE VEHICLE DOWN ALSO.  I HAVE INSPECTED MY FLOOR MAT AND IT WAS NEVER NEAR THE GAS PEDAL DURING ANY OF THE INCIDENTS. I ASSUMED THAT THESE WERE JUST RARE OCCURRENCES.  NOW, AFTER HEARING OTHER TOYOTA OWNERS DESCRIBE SIMILAR ISSUES, I'M WONDERING IF THIS IS RELATED TO A MECHANICAL DEFECT. *TR",
