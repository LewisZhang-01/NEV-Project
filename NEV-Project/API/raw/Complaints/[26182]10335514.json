        "summary": "I HAD A 2000 DODGE STRATUS SE WHICH CAUGHT ON FIRE IN MY DRIVEWAY AFTER MY DAUGHTER RETURNED HOME WITH IT. SHE CAME RUNNING INSIDE SAYING IT WAS SMOKING SO WHEN WE WENT TO LOOK IN WAS ON FIRE, WITH FLAMES SHOOTING OUT OF THE HOOD. I CALL 911 WHILE MY HUSBAND AND A NEIGHBOR SPRAYED THE CAR WITH A HOSE. EVERYTHING UNDER THE HOOD WAS MELTED. WHEN WE CALLED THE DODGE DEALERSHIP THEY PRETTY MUCH LAUGHED AT US SAYING YEAH THERE IS A RECALL FOR THE PRESSURE STEERING HOSE WHICH CAN LEAK AND CAUSE A FIRE. BUT SINCE YOU DIDN'T COME GET IT FIXED TOO BAD, BUT IF YOU BRING IT IN NOW WE WILL REPLACE THE HOSE FOR YOU!!! AFTER MANY CALLS TO THE MAIN DODGE NUMBER THAT IS ON THE RECALL ON THEIR WEBSITE THEY FINALLY LEFT ME A VOICE MAIL STATING WE SENT A NOTICE TOO BAD. I AM SO THANKFUL THAT NOBODY WAS HURT. MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER HAD JUST GOTTEN HOME FROM SCHOOL. IT  WOULD HAVE CAUGHT FIRE THERE WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED. I HAVE LIVED IN A DIFFERENT STATE SINCE BUYING THE CAR SO THAT IS WHY I DIDN'T GET THE NOTICE. IT SADDENS ME TO THINK THAT IS ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS SEND OUT A NOTICE WHEN A FIRE WILL RESULT IF NOT TAKEN CARE OF, AND THEY DON'T CARE. *TR",
