THE TIRE HAD ABOUT 9,000 MILES ON IT.    TODAY, JAN. 3, 2002,  THE TREAD ON A SECOND TIRE SEPARATED WHILE DRIVING IN A PARKING LOT IN ROCKVILLE, MD.  THE TIRES NOW HAVE ABOUT 18,000 MILES ON THEM.    THE ONLY REASON THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT OR INJURY IS THAT WE STOPPED AS SOON AS THERE WAS A STRANGE FEEL TO THE DRIVING AND CHECKED THE TIRES.    I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR 44 YEARS AND HAVE NEVER HAD A TREAD SEPARATING ON A TIRE UNTIL THESE TWO.  THESE ARE CLEARLY DEFECTIVE TIRES. THEY SHOULD BE RECALLED AND THE PURCHASERS SHOULD BE GIVEN NEW TIRES. TS",
