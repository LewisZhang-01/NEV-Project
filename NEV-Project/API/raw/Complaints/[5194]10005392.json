CAR IS EMITTING A VERY NOTICEABLE SULFUR ODOR ESPECIALLY WHEN COMING TO A STOP AT TRAFFIC LIGHTS AFTER DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  CONTACTED DEALER AND WAS TOLD THE PROBLEM IS THE GASOLINE I PURCHASE.  I POINTED OUT THAT I HAVE A 2002 TOYOTA CAMRY THAT I PURCHASED IN APRIL OF 2002, THAT I FILL BOTH CARS WITH THE SAME GASOLINE, AND THAT I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANY SUCH PROBLEM WITH THE CAMRY.  AGAIN I WAS TOLD THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE GASOLINE.  THE INTERNET ABOUNDS WITH DISCUSSION GROUPS WHERE PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ARE REPORTING THE SAME PROBLEM AS I AM EXPERIENCING.",
