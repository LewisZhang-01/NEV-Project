THE ENGINE IS SLOW TO RESPOND IN RPMS WHEN I ASK FOR IT, THEN GOES TO 2,000, THEN TO 3,000, BUT WITH NO CHANGE IN VEHICLE VELOCITY. THE CAR RESPONDS RELATIVELY WELL WITH LIGHT, INCREASING DEPRESSION TO THE PEDAL, BUT NOT TO ANYTHING THAT WOULD CAUSE A DOWN SHIFT. THE PROBLEM GOES AWAY AFTER 8 MILES OR SO OF CITY DRIVING. *JB",
