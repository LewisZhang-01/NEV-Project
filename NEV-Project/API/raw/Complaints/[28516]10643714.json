IT COULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT DUE TO A DISTRACTION AND HAVING TO PULL OVER, ITEMS FALLING OUT IN FRONT OF VEHICLE FOLLOWING, AND ALSO COULD HAVE HAD ITEMS STOLEN. SINCE THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER, IT HAS STOPPED THAT ISSUE BUT, THE TRUNK WILL NOT OPEN WITH THE BUTTON ON THE REAR OF THE TRUNK. THE ONLY WAY IT OPEN IS WITH THE KEY FOB. THIS IS VERY INCONVENIENT AND HAS HAPPENED TO MANY OTHERS. I HAVE STOPPED AT A FEW CHEVROLET DEALERS ASKING FOR THEM TO FIX THIS BEFORE MY WARRANTY EXPIRED BUT THEY WOULD NOT COVER IT.  *TR",
