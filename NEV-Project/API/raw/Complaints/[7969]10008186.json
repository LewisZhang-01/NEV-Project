DEALERSHIP TWICE REPLACED THE FRONT END STRUT MOUNTS WHICH ELIMATED THE GRIND/CLUNK, BUT CANNOT ASCERTAIN THE PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLE'S INSTABILITY (PULLING) ON THE ROAD NOR WITH THE ENGINE MISFIRES.  AN ADJUSTMENT (OFF SPEC) TO THE ALIGNMENT WAS PERFORMED BY DEALERSHIP WHICH IN TURN CAUSED THE VEHICLE TO PULL TO THE LEFT AND ALSO ENCOURAGED MORE STEERING VIBRATION AND WORSENED MPG  - AVG 13.21 MPG WHERE INITIALLY I GOT 18 -20 MPG. DEALERSHIP CLAIMS THAT B/C ROADS ARE ANGLED FOR WATER RUNOFF, THIS LIKEWISE KEEPS MY VEHICLE FROM STAYING ON THE ROAD (!?) AM CURRENTLY BEGINNING TO EXPERIENCE A CLUNKING NOISE FROM REAR PASSENGER SIDE WHEEL AREA, BUT HAVE NOT YET BROUGHT IT TO DEALER'S ATTENTION.*JB",
