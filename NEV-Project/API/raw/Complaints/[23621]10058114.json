THE CAR'S INTERIOR BECOMES FLOODED IN RAIN.  ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS THAT GET WET FAIL OVER TIME AT ACCELERATED AND UNPREDICTABLE RATE.  SAFETY CONCERN: IT IS DIFFICULT TO OPERATE AUXILLIARY COMPONENTS (DEFROSTER, RADIO, ETC WHEN INTERIOR LIGHTS FAIL)  EMERGENCY FLASHER AND ASR BREAKERS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO MOISTURE-RELATED ACCELERATED DECLINE AS A RESULT OF POLLEN FILTER LEAKAGE.  OUR VW DEALER AND VWOA STATED THAT POLLEN FILTER SEAL FAILURE AND ASSOCIATED FLOODING DAMAGE AND ELECTRICAL FAILURE WERE PART OF \"NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR\".  VW SERVICE ADVISORS IN THE WASHINGTON DC AREA HAVE SAID THEY SEE \"SEVERAL OF THESE EACH WEEK\" IN RAINY SEASONS.  THE FILTER DESIGNED TO REDUCE ALLERGENS IN THE AIR HAS THE PERVERSE CONSEQUENCE OF ACCELERATING THE GROWTH OF MOLD INSIDE THE CAR BECAUSE IT SEAL FAILS, CREATES (IN OUR CASE 2\" OF STANDING WATER) MOISTURE IN THE CAR THAT PROMOTES UNPLEASANT, UNHEALTHY, EXPENSIVE-TO-REMIDIATE MOLD GROWTH IN THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT.*AK",
