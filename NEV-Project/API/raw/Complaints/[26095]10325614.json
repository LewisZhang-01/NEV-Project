EVEN WHEN I DO NOT FILL TANK ALL THE WAY (TO PREVENT ABOVE LEAKING) GAS FUMES ARE STILL STRONG AND HAVE ACCUMULATED INSIDE THE CANOPY (TOPPER) ON PICKUP BED.  FUEL APPEARS TO LEAK (BASED ON ODOR) AFTER EXECUTING A SHARP TURN, A QUICK STOP, AND WHEN TRAVELING OVER BUMPY ROADS.  FORD'S PRICE FOR A REPLACEMENT FILLER NECK IS PROHIBITIVE (AROUND $450) PLUS LABOR AND THUS, I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO HAVE THE PROBLEM REPAIRED.  *TR",
