        "summary": "THE GENERATION 3 SEAT BELTS IN MY VAN NEED TO BE REPLACED IN LIGHT OF ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED, INCLUDING ALL THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE WEBSITE WWW.UNSAFEBELTS.COM.  THIS SEEMS TO AFFECT OVER 14 MILLION PEOPLE, AND NO RECALL HAS YET BEEN MADE.  BUT THE DEATHS KEEP RISING, AND THE MONEY ADDS UP FOR DAIMLER-CHRYSLER.  I AM THINKING OF FILING A LAWSUIT OF MY OWN IN THE FACT THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THESE THINGS HAPPENING TO SEAT BELTS AND NOTHING IS BEING DONE EXCEPT SITTING ON THEIR BUTTS!!  TODAY I CALLED CHAMPION DODGE LOCATED IN GULFPORT, MISSISSIPPI AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY WILL NOT REPLACE THE BELTS...INSTEAD I WOULD HAVE TO PA TO GET THEM DONE!!  I THINK A NICE AD IN THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER WILL DO THE TRICK!!  I HAVE A 19-MONTH OLD GIRL, I WILL BE DAMNED IF I WILL JUST LET THIS GO.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  MR. WESTERLUND .    *NLM",
