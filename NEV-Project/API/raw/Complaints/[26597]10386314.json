WITH NO WARNING WHATSOEVER, WHILE DRIVING NORMALLY IN TRAFFIC, THE GEAR SHIFT LEVER BROKE OFF! I WAS UNABLE TO CHANGE GEARS AT ALL AFTERWARDS. ONLY THROUGH SKILL AND LUCK WAS I ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE OFF THE ROAD WITHOUT INCIDENT.    THE MANUFACTURER AND DEALER ARE REPLACING THE AFFECTED PARTS. HOWEVER, THEY ARE USING THE EXACT SAME PARTS AS BEFORE (DESIGN, PART #S ARE IDENTICAL). AS OTHER OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE HAVE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM, THIS IS A SERIOUS QUALITY DEFECT, REMAINING UNADDRESSED, WITH SAFETY IMPLICATIONS.  *TR",
