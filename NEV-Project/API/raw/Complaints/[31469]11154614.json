THE PROBLEM WAS FIRST NOTICED IN FALL OF 2018.  DEALER WAS ABLE TO REPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND SAYS THE ELECTRONIC STEERING RACK AND BOX ARE \"BAD\" AND NEED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $2400.  THE CAR HAS NEVER BEEN IN ANY SORT OF ACCIDENT OR CATASTROPHIC INCIDENT, AND THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF DAMAGE TO COMPONENTS (LIKE TIE ROD ENDS) -- IT'S JUST THE STEERING THAT IS SUDDENLY UNRELIABLE.",
