        "summary": "2013 CHEVY TRAVERSE W/ 120K MILES: WHILE DRIVING 75MPH ON THE FREEWAY THE ENTIRE CAR SHUT OFF. EVERYTHING WENT BLACK, AND I COULDN'T DEPRESS BRAKES, OR TURN THE STEERING WHEEL TO MOVE TO THE SHOULDER. I PANICKED AS I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DESERT WITH MY 5 YEAR OLD. UNACCEPTABLE!  WITHIN MINUTES THE CAR CAME BACK AND WENT INTO LIMP MODE AND I WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT TO A GAS STATION. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, TRACTION CONTROL SERVICE, PARK ASSIST OFF, AND STABILITY CONTROL SERVICE ALL CAME ON. PULLED CODES AND THEY WERE ALL TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE CODES. WHEN I DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY, THE CAR WOULD START JUST FINE BUT WOULD REPLICATE THE PROBLEM IF I DRIVE IT BEYOND A MILE. WAS TOLD THE TRANNY NEEDED  TO BE REPLACED ($3000). I HAD MY UNCLE, A 25+YEAR EXPERIENCED MECHANIC, LOOK AT IT AND SAID THE TRANNY WAS FINE AND BELIEVES IT IS ELECTRICAL AND ONE OF THE CONTROL MODULES MUST NOT BE COMMUNICATING PROPERLY. HIS EXACT WORDS WERE 'THIS CAR IS POSSESSED, IT IS DOING THE WEIRDEST STUFF'. IT CAN'T BE THE TRANNY BECAUSE IF IT WERE IT WOULDN'T JUST COME BACK TO LIFE ON ITS OWN WITHOUT REPAIR. THERE ARE A PLETHORA OF COMPLAINTS ONLINE CONCERNING THIS EXACT SAME ISSUE, YET NO RECALL OR INVESTIGATION WHATSOEVER. WE REPLACED THE ALTERNATOR TWICE IN 4 MONTHS AS WELL DUE TO FAILURE. VOLTAGE GAUGE IS CONSTANTLY JUMPING FROM 12V TO 16V. THE REAR CONTROLS TO THE A/C DIALS ARE EXTREMELY HOT TO THE TOUCH AS WELL. IT'S VERY STRANGE. EVERY MECHANIC FRIEND THAT HAS WORKED ON IT SAYS 'GET RID OF IT BECAUSE THEY'RE THE WORST CARS' AND THEY SEE NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS. CONVENIENTLY, IT HAPPENS JUST OUTSIDE OF THE WARRANTY PERIOD. UNFORTUNATELY WE STILL OWE 15K ON IT. SHAME ON GM FOR IGNORING THESE MAJOR ISSUES FOR THE SAKE OF DOING MAJOR REPAIRS ON SO MANY AFFECTED VEHICLES.",
