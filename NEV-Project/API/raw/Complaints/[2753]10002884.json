        "summary": "I BOUGHT A 1996 MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE AND ON THE WAY HOME IT BROKE DOWN COMPLETELY.  I RESEARCHED THE CAR AND FOUND EVIDENCE THAT THE ODOMETER HAS EITHER BEEN DISCONNECTED OR ROLLED BACK. THE REASON THAT I SAY THIS IS BECAUSE ON WWW.CARFAX.COM IT REPORTS THAT IN 2001 WHEN THIS PERSON PURCHASED THIS CAR IT HAD 51,717 MILES ON IT. THEN IT SAYS THAT OVER A YEAR LATER IN 2002 THAT THE CAR REPORTED 51,719 MILES ON IT. WHAT ARE SOME OTHER THINGS I CAN DO TO MAKE MORE PROOF OF THIS HAPPENING. WHAT CAN I GET OUT OF THE SELLER IF THIS IS THE CASE... ALL MY MONEY BACK? MORE THAN MY MONEY BACK? THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP, I ALSO COPIED AND PASTED THE CARFAX PAGE WITH THE ODOMETER READINGS. GET BACK TO ME ASAP. THANK YOU                  GOOD NEWS! CARFAX SEARCH RESULTS ON THIS 1996 MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE GST ([XXX]) DID NOT UNCOVER A POTENTIAL ODOMETER ROLLBACK. CARFAX ANALYZED THIS VEHICLE'S REPORTED ODOMETER READINGS TO DETERMINE IF ANY READING IS LESS THAN A PREVIOUSLY REPORTED READING.
