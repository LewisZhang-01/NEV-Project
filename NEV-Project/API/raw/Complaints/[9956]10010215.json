TWO WEEKS AGO THE ENGINE STARTED MAKING NOISE AND I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD I NEEDED A NEW ENGINE!!  ($9,000)   I THINK THESE MOTORS ARE DEFECTIVE.  THE MANAGER AT MY DEALERSHIP CALLED THE FACTORY (TO SEE IF THEY MIGHT ASSUME SOME RESPONSIBILITY-I PROVIDED ALL OF MY OIL CHANGE RECEIPTS) ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT THE  INFORMATION I RECEIVED AFTER EACH OIL CHANGE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO SEND ME TO A REPAIR FACILITY??!!  THEY DIDN'T FEEL THAT THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.*JB",
