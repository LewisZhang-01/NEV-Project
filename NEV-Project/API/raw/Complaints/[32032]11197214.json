        "summary": "THIS VEHICLE HAS HAD MULTIPLE ISSUES. STARTER SOUNDS LIKE IT'S STICKING AT START OF ENGINE THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE WE GOT THE VEHICLE. IN 2018 I HAD TO REPLACE THE BATTERY AND THE ALTERNATOR BECAUSE THE CAR WOULD SHUT OFF WHILE DRIVING, AT ONE POINT WITH MY 5YR OLD DAUGHTER EXITING THE FREEWAY(A VERY SCARY AND EXTREMELY UNSAFE EXPERIENCE)  REPLACED WATER PUMP AND TOP FRONT HOSE AFTER I FOUND PUDDLE OF FLUID FROM COOLANT TANK. OTHER WORK DONE ,REPLACED CV JOINTS, LOUD CLICKING WHEN SHARP TURNS WERE MADE AND SHOCKS AND STRUTS REPLACED.  THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE CAR SHUTS OFF WHILE DRIVING AS IT DID BEFORE ALTERNATOR WAS FIXED. NOW I'M EXPERIENCING MORE ELECTRICAL ISSUES LIGHTS TURNING ON AND OFF ON THEIR OWN, AC WILL BLOW AIR SOME TIMES AND OTHER TIMES NO AIR AT ALL. THE TRACTION LIGHT COMES ON AND CAR WILL NOT GO OVER 20-30 MPH. GAS WILL NOT REV UP. GOING TO GET CAR TOWED TO THE MECHANIC TODAY TO DIAGNOSE .  SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING SIMILAR ISSUES WITH THIS VEHICLE MODEL.  SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE, WILL BE CALLING CHRYSLER AND DODGE DEALERSHIP.",
