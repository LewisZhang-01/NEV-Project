THE VEHICLE WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH THE INTERSECTION, UP AND OVER THE CURB AND INTO SOMEONES FRONT YARD.  REPORTED TO THE DEALERSHIP.   TWO MONTHS LATER I HAD  MY  SECOND EXPERIENCE THAT ALSO HAPPENED IN THE RAIN.  I WAS TRYING TO COME TO A STOP AT A STOP SIGN AND COULD NOT STOP THE CAR.  AT THIS TIME I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING FOUND.  THE SERVICE DIRECTOR AT THE TIME REFERRED TO IT AS OPERATOR ERROR AND THOUGHT THAT I WOULD GET USED TO THE VEHICLE.  THEN  SEVEN MONTHS LATER ON JANUARY 1, 2003,  I LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE ON THE BELTWAY TRYING TO AVOID SOMETHING IN THE ROAD.  IT WAS RAINING.   I WAS GOING THE SPEED LIMIT (55 MPH) AND MY CAR  STARTED TO SPIN AND ENDED UP GOING SOUTHBOUND IN THE NORTHBOUND LANES AND FINALLY CRASHED INTO A CONCRETE DIVIDING WALL.   THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.   I FEEL VERY FORTUNATE TO BE ALIVE AND THAT NO ONE ELSE WAS HURT.  THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALERSHIP AND IT IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR POSSIBLE DEFECTS.  I FEEL THAT I AM UNABLE TO DRIVE THIS UNSAFE VEHICLE.    I HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT THE VEHICLE HAS A TENDENCY TO PULL TO THE RIGHT.",
