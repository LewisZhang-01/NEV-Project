IT DOES NOT HAPPEN WHEN YOU ARE INITIALLY OPENING THE DOOR TO GET INTO THE CAR, ONLY AFTER YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN INSIDE.  THIS HAS BEEN OCCURRING CONTINUALLY SINCE DAY OF PURCHASE.  AT FIRST, I THOUGH IT MIGHT BE JUST ME CARRYING AROUND STATIC ELECTRICITY, BUT IT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE ON ANY DOOR OF THE VEHICLE.  IT IS RATHER PAINFUL AT TIMES AS THE SPARK IS CLEARLY VISIBLE, EVEN DURING THE DAY. I HAVEN'T A CLUE WHAT COULD CAUSE THIS, AND PLAN ON MENTIONING IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AT THIS OIL CHANGE.   *JB",
