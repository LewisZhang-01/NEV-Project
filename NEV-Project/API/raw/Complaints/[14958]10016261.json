        "summary": "APRIL 21, 2003  U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION   NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION  OFFICE OF DEFECTS INVESTIGATION  NSA-10.01, 400 7TH STREET, SW  WASHINGTON, DC 20590  SUBJECT: ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM (ABS) DEFECT ?? 2000 MODEL ORION V TRANSIT BUSES  THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT OF DENVER, COLORADO OPERATES A SUBFLEET OF 303 MODEL YEAR 2000 ORION V TRANSIT BUSES.  THESE BUSES ARE EQUIPPED WITH THE MERITOR WABCO ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM (ABS) AND TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM.  ON OCTOBER 29, 2002 DURING A HEAVY SNOWSTORM, 29 OF THESE ORION BUSES EXPERIENCED FRONT WHEEL LOCK UP UPON BRAKE APPLICATION.  IT APPEARED THE ABS MODULATOR VALVES WERE OBSTRUCTED BY SNOW AND ICE, AND FAILED TO RELEASE AIR DURING AN ABS CYCLE.  RTD ACCIDENTALLY DISCOVERED THAT BY POWERING DOWN THE BUSES AND POWERING THEM BACK UP, THE ABS WENT THROUGH A SELF-TEST PROCEDURE, WHICH ALLOWED VENTING OF TRAPPED AIR IN THE BRAKE CHAMBER AND RELEASED THE BRAKE.  THIS PROBLEM REPEATED ON MARCH 19, 2003 DURING ANOTHER HEAVY SNOWSTORM IN DENVER.  DURING THE MIDST OF THE SNOWSTORM, OVER 200 RTD BUSES, MOST OF THEM ORION BUSES, WERE STUCK ON SNOW.  RTD CONTRIBUTED MOST OF THE STUCK BUSES TO THE FRONT WHEEL LOCK UP PROBLEM RESULTING FROM THE FAILURES OF THE ABS.  TWO OTHER SUBFLEETS IN RTD??S FLEET THAT ARE EQUIPPED WITH SIMILAR ABS  EXPERIENCED NO SIMILAR ABS FAILURES DURING THE TWO SNOWSTORMS.  RTD HAS REQUESTED ORION AND MERITOR WABCO TO CORRECT THIS BRAKE SYSTEM SAFETY RELATED DEFECT.  HOWEVER, ORION AND MERITOR WABCO HAVE REFUSED TO TAKE ANY ACTIONS.  RTD IS FILING THIS COMPLAINT IN HOPING OF GETTING THE ASSISTANCE FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO REQUIRE THE VEHICLE MANUFACTURER AND/OR THE EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER TO TAKE ACTIONS TO CORRECT THIS DEFECT.  PLEASE CONTACT THE UNDERSIGNED FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IF NECESSARY AT 303-299-6265 OR EMAIL LOU.HA@RTD-DENVER.COM.   *JB",
