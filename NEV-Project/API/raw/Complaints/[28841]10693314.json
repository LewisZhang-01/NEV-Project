RUNNING LIGHTS AND FOG LIGHTS ARE ON, JUST NO LOW/HIGH BEAMS. CANNOT LEAVE FOR WORK IN MORNING UNTIL IT GETS LIGHT, CANNOT STAY OUT IN EVENING BECAUSE CAR HAS NO LIGHTS. LOCAL DEALERS SAY SAAB 2008 9-7X NOT IN RECALL, BUT NHTSA SITE SAYS OTHERWISE, AND SAAB CUST SERVICE CONFIRMS. CANNOT GET LOCAL DEALER TO FIX UNLESS I PAY FIRST, AND NO FIX GUARANTEED DUE TO SAAB NOT HAVING RESOLVED ISSUE YET. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO FIX THIS CAR IF IT'S MANUFACTURERS POOR DESIGN.   *TR",
