REPORTED THIS INCIDENT TO CHEVROLET, WHICH STATED THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE VAN, HOWEVER, WE HAVE NEVER BEEN NOTIFIED, AND THE VAN HAS BEEN TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT DEALERS FOR MAINTENANCE, YET WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED OF THIS PROBLEM. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT STATED THAT  MY HUSBAND IS LUCKY TO BE ALIVE, AND IT'S A WONDER HE WAS NOT HURT. IF HAD NOT BEEN NOTIFIED BY A PASSING DRIVER, AND HAD NOT PULLED OVER, THE FIRE WOULD HAVE BEEN FUELED BY O2 AND CAUSED A MAJOR EXPLOSION. I WAS TO HAVE DRIVEN THIS VEHICLE ON THIS VERY DAY, WITH BOTH MY CHILDREN, ONE HAS SPECIAL NEEDS. IT MAY HAVE TAKEN ME LONGER TO HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF THE VEHICLE WITH MY CHILDREN. CHEVROLET SAYS IT WILL DO NOTHING BECAUSE THERE WAS NO INJURY OR DEATH.  *****DIMS 11 IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*****770811. *AK    *JB",
