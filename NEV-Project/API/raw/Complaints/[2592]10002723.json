I TOOK IT TO PEFFLEY FORD FOR REPAIRS, THEY CHARGED ME $669.36 AND 6 DAYS LATER MY CAR CUT OUT ON ME AGAIN AND THEY TOWED IT TO THEIR SHOP.  THEY REFUSED TO LOOK AT MY CAR WITHOUT ME PAYING MORE MONEY FOR REPAIRS AND THE TOW TRUCK.  I HAVE SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON REPAIRS FOR MY CAR AND I FEAR FOR MY LIFE EVERY TIME I GET INTO THAT CAR.  I NEVER KNOW WHEN IT WILL CUT OUT AND I CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY A NEW CAR.  I FOUND OUT THAT 8 PEOPLE OWNED THAT CAR BEFORE ME, WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR, THE SALESPERSON SAID THAT IT WOULD BE SAFE FOR MY TWO YOUNG GIRLS TO RIDE IN HE WAS WRONG.  I HAVE ALL OF MY SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND WILL SEND COPIES TO YOU. PLEASE DO SOMETHING BEFORE ONE OR ALL OF MY FAMILY END UP INJURED OR DEAD.  THANKING YOU IN ADVANCE, KAREN JUDKINS.",
