ON DATE INDICATED THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY 2003 MAZDA PROTEGE5 STRUCK A METAL UTILITY POLE WITH SUFFICIENT FORCE TO CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO BE A TOTAL LOSS, YET THE SIDE CURTAIN AIR BAG DID NOT DEPLOY.  THIS WAS A DIRECT AND NOT GLANCING BLOW THE MAIN FORCE OF WHICH STRUCK IMMEDIATELY OVER THE RIGHT REAR WHEEL.  INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, WHEN NOTIFIED, THE MAZDA USA CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANY (USAA) SHOULD INITIATE ANY REQUIRED ACTION.  YET, THE INSURANCE COMPANY CLAIMS THEY ARE NOT \"INVOLVED\" IF THE AIR BAG DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT.  IS NO ONE BUT ME CONCERNED THAT THERE MAY BE A DEFECTIVE SIDE AIR BAG SYSTEM DESIGN OR THAT A DEFECTIVE UNIT MAY HAVE BEEN INSTALLED IN MY CAR?",
