THE FIRST SEPTEMBER 2002. IT APPEARS THAT ONE OF THE BELTS SEPARATED FROM THE INSIDE OF THE TIRE. GOODYEAR REPLACED THE FIRST TIRE AT NO CHARGE, BUT I AM GOING TO HAVE THEM REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH ANOTHER BRAND. THERE WERE NO PUNCTURES OR EVIDENCE OF PRESSURE LOSS NOTED ON EITHER TIRE. GOODYEAR CLAIMS THE DAMAGE WAS RESULTANT OF TIRE PRESSURE LOSS. THIS TIRE WAS THE REPLACEMENT TIRE FOR THE ONE THAT FAILED LAST YEAR. THE MILEAGE ON THE FIRST ONE WAS ABOUT 7000 MILES AND THIS ONE WAS ABOUT 5500.   *JB",
