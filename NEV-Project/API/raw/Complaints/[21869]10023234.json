THE DEALER WANTED US TO PAY $530 AT FIRST.  AFTER SEVERAL PHONE CALLS, THE DEALER MADE US PAY $259.  CHRYSLER DENIED THAT THEIR 2000 MINI-VAN EVAPORATORS ARE DEFECTIVE.  WE THINK THEY ARE DEFECTIVE.  AN AVERAGE EVAPORATOR SHOULD NOT FAIL AT 29000 MILES.  WE SEARCHED THE WEB AND FOUND THAT OTHER CHRYSLER MODELS HAVE HAD EVAPORATOR PROBLEMS.  WE ALSO FOUND THAT THERE IS A SECRET OR GOOD-WILL WARRANTY DEALING WITH A/C EVAPORATOR PROBLEMS.   *JB",
