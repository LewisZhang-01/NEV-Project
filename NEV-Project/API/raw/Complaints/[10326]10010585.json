I'M JUST GLAD IT STAY STUCK IN THE CLOSED POSITION. MY COMPLAINT IS THAT I HAVE TO BUY THE WHOLE UNIT INCLUDING THE MOTOR WITH THE REGULATOR, AND ITS VERY EXPENSIVE.  MY EXTENDED WARRANTY ONLY COVERS THE MOTOR NOT THE  WINDOW REGULATOR BUT 9 TIME OUT 10 ITS GOING TO BE REGULATOR, WHAT A SCAM.   WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS LESS THAN TWO YEARS OLD THE  REAR PASSENGER WINDOW WENT OUT. THE REAR PASSENGER DOORS HINGES SQUEAK AND GRIND. I'VE ALREADY HAD THE RIGHT REAR PASSENGER DOOR HINGE REPLACED, NOW THE LEFT REAR PASSENGER DOOR HINGE IS GETTING WORST.   *NLM",
