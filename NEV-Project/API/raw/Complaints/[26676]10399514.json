THE RADIO SCREEN FLASHED AND DINGED \"POWER STEERING\"  I CALLED MY HUSBAND WHO CAME AND SAW THERE WAS NO POWER STEERING RESERVOIR. TURNS OUT ITS ELECTRIC. AFTER TURNING THE CAR ON, IT SEEMED TO BE BACK TO NORMAL. THIS HAPPENED A FEW TIMES SINCE THEN, NOW MY CAR IS STUCK PERMANENTLY. AS SOON AS I TURN IT ON, IT SAYS \"POWER STEERING\" AND WILL NOT RESOLVE NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I TURN IT ON AND OFF. HORRIBLE CAR!!  *TR",
