THE VEHICLE HAS A SUNROOF AND WE HAVE READ ABOUT MANY PEOPLE HAVING THIS SAME PROBLEM.  CONTACTED JEEP VEHICLE WAS 2 MONTHS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THEY REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING.  TOLD US TO TAKE IT TO A JEEP DEALER AND GET IT FIXED OURSELVES.  MANY PEOPLE HAVE DONE THIS MULTIPLES TIMES AND THEIR CARS STILL LEAK.  JEEP IS STILL LEAKING ON THE FLOOR BEDS.  THEY ARE SOAKED ON DRIVER'S SIDE. IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO RAIN AND JUST THE DEW ON THE CAR CAUSES THE FLOOR TO BE WET.  WE FEAR ELECTRICAL DAMAGE THAT CAN CAUSE FAULT OF VEHICLE RESULTING IN INJURY, MOLD, AND RUSTING OUT.  SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS!  *TR",
