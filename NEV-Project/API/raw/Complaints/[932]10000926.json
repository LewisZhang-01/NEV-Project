THE SERVICE DEPT. THERE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS THE RESULT OF A WORN OUT POWER TRANSFER UNIT.  THE COST TO REPLACE IT INCLUDING THE DIAGNOSTIC AND REPAIR LABOR WILL APPROACH $3,000.  SINCE THE VAN IS ONLY 3 YEARS OLD AND HAS ONLY 67 THOUSAND MILES ON IT, IT SEEMS LIKE THE POWER TRANSFER UNIT MUST BE EITHER CHEAP OR DEFECTIVE.  WITH ONLY THIS MUCH MILEAGE TO HAVE TO REPLACE MAJOR POWER TRAIN COMPONENTS MAKES ME THINK THAT THERE MUST BE A PROBLEM WITH EITHER THE DESIGN OR THE PARTS QUALITY.",
