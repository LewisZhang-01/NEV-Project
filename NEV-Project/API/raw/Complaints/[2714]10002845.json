THE ODOR IMPREGNATES MY CLOTHING AND EXPOSED SKIN AND HAS CAUSED MINOR (AT THIS TIME, AT LEAST) RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS.  I AM FORCED ON THESE OCCASIONS, WEATHER PERMITTING, TO RIDE WITH MY WINDOWS DOWN TO LESSEN THE EFFECT.  THE OCCURRENCE IS INTERMITTENT AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PINPOINT CAUSING FACTORS.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS FAILED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM (4 VISITS), SUGGESTING THAT IT'S JUST THE AIR BEING BROUGHT INTO THE VENTILATION SYSTEM.  TS",
