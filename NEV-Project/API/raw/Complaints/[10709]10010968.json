        "summary": "THE BACK OF DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT SEAT FELL OFF APPROXIMATELY 1 YEAR AGO. A BOLT WAS TIGHTENED AND THE SEAT SEEMED OK,  BUT THEN BECAME LOOSE. CAR WAS AT DEALER FOR REGULAR SERVICING A FEW MONTHS AGO AND WAS TOLD THIS WAS NORMAL. LAST WEEK SEAT BACK BECAME VERY LOOSE AND WHEN CAR WAS IN FOR REGULAR SERVICE I ASKED THEM TO LOOK AT IT AND  WAS TOLD BRACKET WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED AT COST OF APPROXIMATELY $800. AFTER MUCH PROTEST, DEALER CLAIMED THEY NEEDED TO  CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER. LATER THAT DAY THEY AGREED TO REPLACE AT NO COST AS \"GOOD WILL\" GESTURE AND SCHEDULED REPAIR FOR NEXT DAY. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH, I FOUND OUT THAT THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM ON BOTH THE ACCORD AND CIVIC AND THERE IS A NHTSA PENDING. REF ACTION # PE02072. I ALSO OWN A SATURN AND IT WAS RECALLED FOR A SIMILAR SEAT BRACKET PROBLEM . HONDA SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM WITH A RECALL.     *JB",
