FIXED SHORT TERM BY TURNING CAR OFF AND BACK ON AGAIN. VERY DANGEROUS AT LOW SPEEDS, ESPECIALLY WITH THE WEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE AND SIZE OF THE TIRES, SPECIFICALLY FOR SMALLER PEOPLE. RECALL FROM FORD FOR 2011, WILL NOT HELP AT ALL WITH A 2010 FLEX. HAS ALREADY CAUSED ONE ACCIDENT IN A PARKING LOT RESULTING IN DAMAGE TO REAR DRIVER SIDE QUARTER PANEL AFTER STEERING WHEEL BECAME STUCK WHILE REVERSING. FUEL PUMP ALSO NOT ENGAGING, RESULTING IN STALLS AND THE CAR NOT STARTING (NO TICKS, HUMMING, BUZZING, LIGHTS AND RADIO WORK). OVERALL, A VERY DANGEROUS COMBINATION IF THEY WERE TO OCCUR SIMULTANEOUSLY, ESPECIALLY AT SPEED. CAR WAS PURCHASED AROUND 1 1/2- 2 MONTHS AGO. BOTH ISSUES ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE FREQUENT.",
