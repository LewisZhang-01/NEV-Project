THE FIRST ONE I CAME TO A STOP SIGN AND MADE A COMPLETE STOP, WHEN I WENT TO ACCELERATE MY ACCELERATOR, BRAKE PEDAL  AND STEERING WHEEL LOCKED, I HAD TO PUT THE CAR ON PARK AND TURN THE ENGINE OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET, WAIT A MOMENT, TURN IT ON, IT TOOK A WHILE TO TURN ON BUT THEN EVERYTHING WENT BACK TO NORMAL AND I CONTINUED MY JOURNEY. THE SECOND TIME, I WAS I WAS DRIVING AND SLOWED DOWN TO MAKE A LEFT TURN, AS I STARTED TURNING MY CAR COMPLETELY STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, AGAIN, EVERYTHING LOCKED, AND I ALMOST GOT IT WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC. ONCE AGAIN I HAD TO PUT THE CAR ON PARK AND SHUT THE ENGINE OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC AND WAIT FOR IT TO TURN BACK ON. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS CAUSING THIS BUT IT'S VERY DANGEROUS AND I COULD'VE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE.",
