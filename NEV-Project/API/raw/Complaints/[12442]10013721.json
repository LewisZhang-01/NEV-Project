I HAD THE CAR BACK IMMEDIATELY AND THEY TOLD ME THAT IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE TIRES AND CAUSED NO SAFETY RISK.  THIS BECAME WORSE, I TOOK IT BACK AGAIN WITH THE SAME PROBLEM, ONLY NOW WORSE ESPECIALLY AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  THEY NOW TOLD ME THAT THE ROTORS WERE WORN AND NEEDED TO BE TURNED DOWN.  THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS NOT COVERED SINCE THE WARRANTY WAS ONLY GOOD FOR 15,000 MILES AND THIS HAD BEEN EXCEEDED.  WELL THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTED, AND NOW I NEEDED TO REPLACE THE ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS.  THIS PROBLEM CONTINUES AND NOW 2 YEARS LATER HAVE TO REPLACE THE ROTORS, BRAKE PADS, AND SOME TELL  ME TO CHANGE TO BRAKE HOSES AND THE CALIPERS ALONG WITH THIS.  MY DEALER DOES NOT WANT TO WORK WITH ME, BUT CAN STAND THERE AND TELL ME THAT THIS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE INTREPID, CONCORDE, LXI, 300M --- AND THE KICKER IS THAT THEY ARE NOT CONCERNED WITH THIS BECAUSE THE WARRANTY IS UP.  I HAVE ONLY 7,000 MILES ON THE NEW ROTORS, BRAKE PADS AND BRAKE HOSES AND NOW THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED AGAIN.  I PAY ENOUGH FOR THIS PIECE OF '!@#$%, AND EVERY THREE MONTHS I HAVE TO PUT HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS INTO THE BRAKING SYSTEM.  I HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS UNHAPPY WITH A VEHICLE, AND I HAVE OWNED MANY NEW VEHICLES.     *NLM",
