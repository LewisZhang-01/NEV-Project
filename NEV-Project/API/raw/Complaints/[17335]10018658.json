THE CAR BUCKS LIKE IT IS NOT GETTING ANY FUEL.  THE V-TEC DOES NOT WANT TO KICK IN ALL THE TIME ANYMORE.  LOSS OF POWER. IT HAS BEEN TO THE DEALER ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, WHEN THEY CANNOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  WE HAVE HAD ALL THESE PROBLEMS SINCE THE A/C UNIT WENT OUT LAST JULY AND THE CAR HAS NOT BEEN RIGHT SINCE.  WE SPENT $100 ON SPARK PLUGS THAT WE WERE TOLD WOULD FIX THE FUEL PROBLEM, THAT HAS NOT CHANGED.  WE ARE NOT NOTIFIED OF ANY RECALLS WE HAVE TO FIND THEM OURSELVES. *JB",
