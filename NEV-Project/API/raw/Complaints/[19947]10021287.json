WHEN I REMOVED THE WHEELS I LOOKED AT MY BRAKES AND THEY WERE FINE, I THEN LOOKED AT MY WHEEL AND NOTICED A VERY LARGE CRACK ALL THEY WAY AROUND.  I WENT THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE AND THEY REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING SINCE IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  THEY INSISTED THAT WHEN I HAD NEW TIRES PUT ON THAT THEY MUST OF USED TOO MUCH FORCE AND CRACKED THE RIMS.  I WENT TO THE TIRE PLACE WHERE I HAD JUST RECENTLY PURCHASED TIRES AND THEY SAID THERE WAS NO WAY THEY COULD HAVE DONE IT, BUT PUT MY CAR UP ON THE RACKS AND CHECKED THE REST OF MY WHEELS.  COME TO FIND THE OTHER THREE RIMS WERE CRACKED AS WELL.  I TOOK MY CONCERNS TO THE SERVICE MANAGER OF THE AUTOMOTIVE NETWORK I PURCHASED MY CAR FROM AND HE AGREED THAT IT WAS A SAFETY ISSUE AND REPLACE ALL FOUR WHEELS WITH BRAND NEW ONES FROM KIA.*AK",
