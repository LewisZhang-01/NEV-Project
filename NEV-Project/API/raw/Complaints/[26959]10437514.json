DOORS SHUT BUT DON'T LATCH FULLY WHICH CAN CAUSE THE DOOR TO POP OPEN. THIS SHOULD OF BEEN A RECALL A WHILE AGO. WHEN TALKING TO MY MECHANIC AND A FEW OTHER PEOPLE WITH A 99-01 RANGER EXTENDED CAB 4 DOOR THEY HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. MY MECHANIC SAYS THIS IS A KNOWN FORD PROBLEM. I FEAR THAT SOMEONE IN THE BACK JUMP SEAT WILL BE LEANING UP AGAINST THE DOOR AND IT WILL POP OPEN WHEN GOING DOWN THE ROAD. I AM IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING THIS ISSUE CORRECTED BUT IT IS GOING TO BE A COSTLY FIX THAT I SHOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SINCE THIS IS A FORD RANGER PROBLEM AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE HAVING IT!!!  *KB",
