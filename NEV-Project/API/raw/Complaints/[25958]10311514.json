        "summary": "I HAVE A 2006 PRIUS WITH HID HEADLIGHTS.  A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO I NOTICED THAT ONE OR SOMETIMES BOTH HEADLIGHTS WOULD GO OUT INTERMITTENTLY.  WE LIVE ON A STREET WITHOUT STREETLAMPS AND I HAD SOME SCARY MOMENTS SEVERAL TIMES WHEN BOTH LIGHTS WENT OUT.  WHEN I TOLD MY DEALER ABOUT IT, THEY SAID THEY COULD DO NOTHING AS THE LIGHTS WERE WORKING WHEN THEY EXAMINED THEM.  FINALLY, I GOT A LETTER FROM TOYOTA (ATTACHED), WHICH SAID THEY WOULD LOWER THE REPLACEMENT PRICE OF THE HEADLIGHTS (BUT NOT WARNING OF THE PROBLEMS I HAD BEEN HAVING).  I HAD MY DEALER REPAIR THE LIGHTS AT A COST OF $559.25.  THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT IF I COMPLAINED TO TOYOTA, THEY WOULD REIMBURSE ME.  A CASE MANAGER AT TOYOTA SAID THEY WOULD PAY FOR THE PARTS (ABOUT $300).  I HAVE NOW READ OF HUNDREDS OF OTHER PEOPLE WITH MY MODEL CAR WHO HAVE HAD IDENTICAL PROBLEMS.  I FEEL THAT TOYOTA SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL FOR A DANGEROUS PROBLEM LIKE THIS, OR AT LEAST NOTIFY THE DEALERS SO WHEN OWNERS COMPLAIN OF THE PROBLEM IT IS REPAIRED UNDER WARRANTY. *TR",
