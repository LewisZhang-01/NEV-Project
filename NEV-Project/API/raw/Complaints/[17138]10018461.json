I'M GETTING REALLY FED UP WITH HAVING THE CAR IN THE SHOP ALL THE TIME. NOW, AT 57,000 MILES, THE INTAKE GASKETS NEED TO BE REPLACED AT A COST OF $600, WHEN THEY WERE ALREADY REPLACED AT 16,000 MILES WHEN THE INTAKE WAS REPLACED. WE THOUGHT WE WERE DONE PAYING FOR THIS CAR, BUT I GUESS NOT.   *JB",
