        "summary": "ON THE DATE GIVEN, MY 19 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING ON A SECONDARY ROAD IN THE TOWN OF PERU, NY, WHEN THE RIGHT FRONT (FACTORY OPTION) CAST ALUMINUM WHEEL SPLIT IN TWO CIRCUMFRENTIALLY, PULLING HER VIOLENTLY INTO A SNOWBANK.  THERE WAS NO PRIOR INDICATION OF THE FAILURE, AND THE VEHICLE HAD NEVER BEEN ABUSED OR INVOLVED IN ANY ACCIDENT OR INCIDENT.  THE VEHICLE IS A 1997 DODGE GRAND CARAVAN LS, AND THE WHEEL IN QUESTION IS THE FACTORY OPTIONAL ALUMINUM CAST ITEM.  WE FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE DEALER AND THE MANUFACTURER, AND WERE TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE AND THAT THE FAILURE WAS OUR FAULT.       THERE WAS NO PREVIOUS DAMAGE TO THE WHEEL, IT HAD NEVER BEEN ABUSED, THERE  WAS NO AIR LEAKAGE OVER TIME TO INDICATE A CRACK OR FAULT, THE TEMPERATURE AT THE TIME WAS APPROXIMATELY 10 DEGREES F., AND THERE WAS NO OBSTACLE IN THE ROAD WHICH COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT.  THE WHEEL SIMPLY BROK INTO TWO PIECES.     WE FEEL THAT YOUR ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE MADE AWARE OF THIS POSSIBLE DEFECT SINCE SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED FAILURE OF SUCH A VITAL PIECE OF VEHICLE EQUIPMENT COULD OBVIOUSLY PROVE FATAL.  IF THIS HAD OCCURRED ON AN INTERSTATE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, OR IF THE LEFT FRONT WHEEL HAD FAILED, PULLING THE VEHICLE INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC, THE POSSIBLE RESULTS ARE OBVIOUS.      PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CONTACT MYSELF OR MY WIFE AT ANY TIME CONCERNING THIS MATTER, AND WE ARE CURIOUS TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE RECEIVED ANY OTHER COMPLAINTS OF THIS NATURE.       THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ASSISTANCE.",
