OBVIOUSLY, A UNIT THAT CORRODES SO EASILY ON NEWISH VEHICLES IS A DEFECT IN MANUFACTURING.  IT'S A NO BRAINER THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE TOO.  I LIKE THE IDEA OF YOUR WEBSITE: \"PEOPLE SAVING PEOPLE\".  I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WITH ALL THE COMPLAINTS ON THIS PROBLEM, WITH THE BACKORDER ON REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR IT, ALL THE TALK ABOUT IT, THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN A DEFECT INVESTIGATION ON IT.  I LOOKED IN YOUR DATABASE AND IT SHOWS ZERO DEFECT INVESTIGATIONS ON ANY NISSAN MADE IN 2000 -- DOESN'T MATTER WHAT MAKE OR MODEL, NISSAN IS RUBBER-STAMPED FOR APPROVAL???    I OWN A 2000  XTERRA.  THIS PROBLEM HASN'T HAPPENED TO MINE YET, BUT I'M SURE IT WILL SINCE I'M APPROACHING 47K MILES.  I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM AS A PASSENGER IN ANOTHER VEHICLE.  AND I SWEAR, IT IS SCARY!  SINCE NISSAN WON'T INITIATE A RECALL, AND YOU SAY ON THE WEBSITE YOU DON'T NEED A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE, DON'T YOU THINK THIS IS ONE THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO???  THANKS.   *NLM",
