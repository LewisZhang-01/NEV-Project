        "summary": "IN JANUARY OF 2000 AFTER 3 TRIPS TO THE HONDA TELLING THEM THAT I HAD A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM (AND BEING TOLD THEIR WAS NOTHING WRONG), MY TRANSMISSION FAILED.  THE SYMPTOM WAS THAT IT WOULD INTERMITTENTLY HARD SHIFT INTO 4TH GEAR FROM 3RD WHILE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND LOOSE POWER.  THE UNIT HAD THESE SYMPTOMS FOR APPROXIMATELY 24000 MILES, BUT WAS FIRST BROUGHT TO HONDA WITH 9000 MILES ON.  HONDA REFUSED TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM AND TOLD ME THEIR WAS NOTHING WRONG.  AT THE TIME, I INDICATED THAT I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT SAFETY WITH MERGING INTO AND OUT OF TRAFFIC, BUT MY CONCERNS FELL ON DEATH EARS.    AFTER THE ORIGINAL TRANSMISSION FINALLY FAILED (2 DAYS AFTER THE LAST TIME I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND COMPLAINED OF THE PROBLEM), A NEW TRANSMISSION WAS FINALLY INSTALLED A MONTH LATER.    THE REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION HAS 58,000 MILES ON IT AND HAS BEGUN TO EXHIBIT EXACTLY THE SAME SYMPTOMS AS THE ORIGINAL TRANSMISSION.  BEING CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING THE RUN AROUND, I DECIDED NOT TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE ORIGINAL DEALER (MADISON HONDA, MADISON, NJ) BUT TO PARAMUS HONDA, PARAMUS, NJ.  I EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM AND THE SPECIFIC SYMPTOM (THAT CAN BE RECREATED EVERY TIME), THEY DIAGNOSED THE UNIT AND TOLD ME NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH IT.      ADDITIONALLY, HE UNIT HAS BEGUN TO INTERMITTENTLY JITTER WHILE DRIVING IN 4TH GEAR, CAUSING A LOSS OF POWER.      HONDA SEEMS CONTENT TO IGNORE THIS PROBLEM.  THE DEALERS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN TOLD BY HONDA OF AMERICA NOT TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSIONS UNTIL THEY COMPLETELY FAIL.  THIS POLICY IS PUTTING HONDA'S CUSTOMERS AS SEVERE RISK.  DRIVING IN NORTHERN NJ REQUIRES BEING ABLE TO MERGE INTO THE TRAFFIC AND SO ON.  FAILURE OF THE TRANSMISSION TO PRODUCE POWER HAS ALMOST GOTTEN ME KILLED ONCE.  HONDA DOES NOT SEEM TO CARE.    ONCE AGAIN I'M GETTING THE RUN AROUND EVEN THOUGH IT COULD LEAD TO MY DEATH.",
