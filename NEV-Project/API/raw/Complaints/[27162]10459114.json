        "summary": "THOUSAND OF REPORTED CASES OF NOT BEING ABLE TO FUEL UP THE NISSAN 350Z.  THE PROBLEM SOURCE IS THE FILLER NECK SHUTTER VALVE. NISSAN IS AWARE OF THE ISSUE FOR YEARS AND HAVE BEEN MAKING CUSTOMER FOOT THE $400-$500 BILL INSTEAD OF TAKING ACTION ON THE FAULTY PART. THE FAULTY SHUTTER VALVE CAUSES FUEL TO SPEW OUT WHILE FILLING THE TANK COVERING THE CAR AND OPERATOR IN FUEL. THE RISKY PART IS PEOPLE ARE CHANGING THE WAY THEY FILL TO TRY TO BYPASS THE ACTION OF THE SHUTTER VALVE BUT ALSO WORKS AGAINST THE SAFETY FEATURES OF THE GASOLINE NOZZLE CAUSING IT TO NOT SHUT OFF WHEN FUEL REACHES MAX. I PERSONALLY CANT ONLY GET 7 GALLONS IN MY CAR BEFORE IT SPRAYS OUT WHICH IS VERY ANNOYING SINCE I HAVE TO FIGHT TO ADD 7 GALLONS OF FUEL EVERYOTHER DAY. I FOUGHT WITH THIS ISSUE IN MY 2003 350Z AND MY 04. IT IS EXTREMELY COMMON AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECALLED YEARS AGO.  *TT",
