AT 3,000 MILES, THE FIRST TWO TIRES DEVELOPED SEVERE BUBBLING IN THE SIDEWALLS AND BOTH TIRES WERE REPLACED FREE OF CHARGE BY THE AUDI DEALER BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY WERE AWARE THERE WERE PROBLEMS WITH THESE TIRES.  BY 15,000 MILES 2 MORE TIRES HAD SEVERE BUBBLING IN THE SIDEWALLS AND I HAD A FLAT TIRE WHEN THE TIRE PULLED AWAY FROM THE RIMS. THERE IS SOMETHING TERRIBLY WRONG WITH THIS BRAND OF TIRE. I HAVE NOW REPLACED ALL 4 TIRES IN UNDER 15,000 MILES. ONE OF THE TIRES THAT WAS REPLACED AT THE 3,000 MARK WAS THE SAME TIRE THAT HAD THE FLAT IN IT AT 15,000 MILES.  IF THE AUDI DEALER IN LATHAM, NEW YORK KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE SIDEWALLS ON THESE TIRES AND REPLACED THEM WITHOUT A FIGHT, THEN YOU KNOW THERE IS A VALID COMPLAINT HERE. PLEASE, IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY, LOOK INTO THESE TIRES AS I BELIEVE THEY HAVE SERIOUS DEFECTS. I HAVE THE PAPERWORK ON THE ABOVE REPLACEMENTS SHOULD YOU NEED VERIFICATION.*JB",
