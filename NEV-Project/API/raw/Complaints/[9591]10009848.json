        "summary": "WHEN THE RIGHT FRONT BEARING ASSEMBLY LOCKED UP DUE TO LACK OF GREASE IT ALMOST PUT ME IN THE DITCH ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD.  IT HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE NEAREST FORD DEALER, BRANDON FORD AND THEY REPLACED THE WHOLE TIGHT ASSEMBLY COSTING ABOUT $600 AND WAS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  THEY DID NOT, HOWEVER CHECK OR REPLACE THE LEFT SIDE ASSEMBLY WHICH FAILED AT A HIGHER SPEED.  THE LEFT SIDE ASSEMBLY LOCKED UP 200 MILES LATER WHILE I WAS TAKING IT TO HAVE IT REPLACED AND THIS TIME AT 65 MPH AND ALMOST THREW ME INTO A RETAINING WALL BEING USED ON I-4 MLK TAMPA.  I AM FILING THIS REPORT WITH YOU SO THAT IF THERE ARE ANY MORE VEHICLES OUT THERE -EXPLORER AND RANGERS THAT FORD FAILED TO LUBRICATE AND ARE SUBJECT TO FAILURE, IT WILL BE ON RECORD.  AS CLOSE AS IT WAS TO CAUSING A WRECK, I FEEL THAT THEY SHOULD FOLLOW UP TO MAKE SURE THAT SOME UNSUSPECTING AND LESS ALERT DRIVER DOESN'T GET KILLED OR KILL SOMEONE ELSE.    *JB    ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****734299",
