        "summary": "UNCOMMANDED MOVEMENT OF OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS.  DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MEMORY MIRRORS WANDER AND DO NOT GO BACK TO A PREVIOUSLY SET POSITIONS.  PRESSING KEY FOB TO UNLOCK DOORS, INSERTING KEY INTO IGNITION OR PRESSING MEMORY RECALL BUTTON CAUSES MIRROR MOVEMENT FROM PRESET POSITIONS REQUIRING MANUAL READJUSTMENTS EVERY TIME VEHICLE IS DRIVEN.  WHEN USING TILT IN REVERSE FUNCTION, MIRRORS DO NOT RETURN TO INITIAL DRIVING POSITION.  MIRRORS ALSO DRIFT OUT OF POSITION WHILE HIGHWAY DRIVING FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME (MAINLY DRIVER'S SIDE).  VEHICLE HAS BEEN TO DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT 6 TIMES FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM.  BOTH MIRRORS HAVE BEEN REPLACED, PASSENGER MIRROR CURRENTLY OPERATING PROPERLY AFTER REPLACEMENT.  PRESENTED SERVICE DEPARTMENT WITH A COPY OF GM SERVICE BULLETIN 02-08-64-008 DATED APRIL 2002 DURING MY LAST VISIT (MAR 2003) TO HAVE DRIVERS MIRROR CORRECTED.  THEY STATED SEVERAL OTHER CUSTOMERS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AND GM HAS DIRECTED THEM TO NOT REPLACE MIRRORS DESPITE THE GM SERVICE BULLETIN.  THEY COULD NOT PROVIDE ANY TIME FRAME THEY EXPECT A RESOLUTION FROM GM IF ANY AND DID NOT OPEN A SERVICE TICKET FOR MY VEHICLES DISCREPANCY DURING THE LAST VISIT.  PROPERLY ADJUSTED REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE A REQUIRED SAFETY ITEM FOR ALL VEHICLES LICENSED TO BE DRIVEN ON PUBLIC ROADS.  MALFUNCTIONING MIRRORS CLEARLY JEOPARDIZE PUBLIC SAFETY AND IT IS OBVIOUS FROM THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE, GM HAS A SAFETY PROBLEM WITH THEIR PRODUCT REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION AND RESOLUTION.  ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND HELP RESOLVING THIS SAFETY ISSUE WILL BE APPRECIATED.   *NLM",
