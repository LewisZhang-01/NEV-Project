DEALER SAID TOUGH LUCK, EXPENSE INCLUDED ROTOR REPAIR AND DAMAGED FRONT TIRES.  NOW AT 40,000 MILES PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE RETURNING.  BASED ON PREVIOUS RECALLS, TALKING TO DEALERS, BRAKE REPAIR SHOPS AND READING MANY SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET AS WELL AS OUR LOCAL SCHOOL VAN TRAVELING WITH STUDENTS HAVING A WRECK BECAUSE OF ROTOR FAILURE, IT IS MORE THAN OBVIOUS THAT THERE IS A KNOWN SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH INFERIOR/UNSAFE BRAKE ROTORS.  LIKE MOST AMERICANS, I HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO STORIES OF HOW THE AUTO MANUFACTURES ARE KNOWINGLY WILLING TO TRADE A FEW HUNDRED LIVES TO AVOID THE EXPENSE OF RECALLS AND BUILDING CARS WITH SAFE COMPONENTS.  IT DOESN'T TAKE A REAL BRIGHT PERSON TO KNOW THAT WHEN THE STEERING AND BRAKING SYSTEM ON A CAR FAILS WHILE TRAVELING AT NORMAL SPEEDS AND IN MY CASE ON TREACHEROUS MOUNTAIN ROADS THAT SERIOUS ACCIDENTS MAY AND WILL RESULT.  MY GOAL IS TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM ADDRESSED BY DAIMLER CHRYSLER AND INDUSTRY-WIDE BEFORE, NOT AFTER, THE BODY COUNTS START ADDING UP.  I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH DAIMLER CHRYSLER AND WAS BASICALLY TOLD WHERE TO STICK MY CONCERNS AND COMPLAINT.  ANY ASSISTANCE WILL BE APPRECIATED BY ME AND I SUSPECT BY OTHER POTENTIAL VICTIMS.
