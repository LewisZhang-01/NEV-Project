ALSO NOTICED THAT ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN GOING DOWNHILL THE VAN FELT LIKE IT WAS FREE WHEELING WITH NO ENGINE HOLD BACK.   IF THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS SET THE VAN WOULD MAINTAIN THE SAME SET SPEED UP AND DOWNHILL WITH NOTICEABLE ENGINE HOLD BACK DOWNHILL.  IT MAY OPERATE IN ONE MODE FOR MANY DAYS BEFORE IT CHANGES TO THE OTHER.  TWO CHEVROLET DEALERS SAID THIS WAS NORMAL.  AT TIMES IF I REMOVE MY FOOT FROM THE PEDAL AT 30MPH THE VAN WILL MAINTAIN THAT SPEED FOR 2 BLOCKS.       *TT",
