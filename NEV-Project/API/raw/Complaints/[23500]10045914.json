        "summary": "I AM THE OWNER OF A 2002 HONDA ODYSSEY EX, WHICH I PURCHASED NEW. ONLY TWO YEARS OLD AT APPROXIMATELY 33,000 MILES, THE TRANSMISSION ENDURED PRONOUNCED SLIPPAGE; THE ENGINE WOULD REV AT HIGH RPMS WITHOUT ACCELERATING (AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND FROM STARTING FROM A STOP). UNEXPECTED DECELERATION WAS ALSO NOTED AT TIMES. BEING UNDER WARRANTY (BARELY), HONDA REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION WITH A REMANUFACTURED ONE AT NO COST. UPON FURTHER INQUIRY, I DISCOVERED HUNDREDS (LITERALLY) OF OTHER COMPLAINTS, IDENTICAL TO MINE, IN THE 1999-2003 ODYSSEY. THE PROBLEM IS TWO-FOLD: 1) IF THE PROBLEM IS MECHANICAL FAILURE DUE TO A DESIGN FLAW, WHY ARE THE TRANSMISSIONS BEING REPLACED WITH THE SAME RE-MANUFACTURED TRANSMISSION (REPLACED AS OPPOSSED TO REPAIRED) AND 2) DUE TO THE EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTANTS (MANY OF WHOM CLAIM TO HAVE ENDURED COSTS) ABOUT ACUTE TRANSMISSION FAILURE IT WOULD APPEAR THAT A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE IS INVOLVED THAT SHOULD BE PROACTIVELY ADDRESSED BY HONDA. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH THEY ARE WILLING TO REPLACE WITH A REMANUFACTURED TRANNY AND A 12MONTH/12K MILE WARRANTY KNOWING THAT THESE TRANNIES ARE MALFUNCTIONING MORE IN THE 30K-60K MILE RANGE (COST OVER SAFETY?).  *AK",
