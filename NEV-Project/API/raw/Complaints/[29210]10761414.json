SECOND TIME IN THREE WEEKS SUCH INCIDENT OCCURRED AND THIS IS AFTER SUPPOSED \"SAFETY RECALL\" WORK DONE ON THE VEHICLE A FEW MONTHS BACK.  PREVIOUS TO THE RECALL, THE CAR ACTUALLY SHUTDOWN NUMEROUS TIMES WHILE TRAVELING AT HIGH RATES OF SPEED ON MAJOR INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS.  AFTER THE LIGHT COMES ON, THE GAS PEDAL IS NO LONGER RESPONSIVE AND YOU HAVE TO HOPE YOU CAN COAST OFF THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  ONCE YOU STOP SAFELY AND TURN OFF THE CAR, AFTER WAITING 5-10 MINUTES, THE CAR USUALLY COMES BACK ON, WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE IT IS DUE TO SOME SORT OF OVERTEMP CONDITION.",
