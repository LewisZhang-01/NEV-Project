I WAS DRIVING RESIDENTIAL BACKROADS BY MY HOUSE, ACCELERATED SLIGHTLY TO GET UP A HILL AND THAT'S WHEN IT TOOK OFF.  THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS UNRESPONSIVE, THE EMERGENCY BREAK WAS UNRESPONSIVE, I PULLED THE FLOOR MAT OUT FOR GOOD MEASURE, NOTHING WORKED, IT KEPT ACCELERATING AT A HIGH RATE UNTIL I FINALLY SLAMMED IT THROUGH GEARS TO \"PARK\" TO GET IT TO A STOP.  I HAD IT TOWED TO THE LEXUS DEALERSHIP, WHERE THE TOW TRUCK DRIVER EVEN TOLD ME WHEN IT STARTED THE CAR TO GET IT UP ON THE TRUCK, AFTER BEING TURNED OFF FOR OVER 12 HOURS, IT WAS STILL RED LINING THE ENGINE, AND EVEN LURCHED FORWARD BUT BECAUSE THE CAR WAS IN PARK, IT DIDN'T CRASH INTO THE BACK OF THE TOW TRUCK. LEXUS INVESTIGATED THE CAR AND DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME WHY IT HAPPENED.  I DEMAND AN EXPLANATION AND A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE - ONE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A HISTORY OF HAVING SUA PROBLEMS.  I FEAR FOR MY LIFE EVERYTIME I HAVE TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE.  *TR",
