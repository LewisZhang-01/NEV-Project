NOT THE BATTERY.  5/6, 5/8--ENGINE DIED WHILE I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD.  IGNITION CLICKED WHEN TRIED TO RESTART.  TAKEN TO REPAIR SHOP AGAIN--COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM.  CHRONIC--SINCE I HAVE HAD THE AUTO THE \"LOW COOLANT LIGHT\" SHOWS.  THIS LAST TIME AT REPAIR SHOP, I WAS TOLD THAT AUTO WAS LEAKING COOLANT--MOST LIKELY GASKET AND WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO REPAIR. *TR",
