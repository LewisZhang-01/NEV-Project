WHEN I STARTED HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH THE BRAKES, TWO MECHANICS SAID THEY COULD NOT FIX IT. THE JEEP DEALER LAUGHED AT ONE OF THEM AND SAID GOOD LUCK. THIS IS A KNOWN DEFECT WITH THE ABS SYSTEM WITH NO REPAIR. NOW, THE BRAKES HAVE COMPLETELY GONE OUT ON ME TWICE WHILE DRIVING. I HAVE MANEUVERED OFF THE ROAD SAFELY BOTH TIMES, BUT FEAR FOR THE TIME I WON'T BE SO LUCKY.    *NLM",
