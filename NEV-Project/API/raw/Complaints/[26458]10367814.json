IT ALSO SHOWS IT HAS NO GAS WHEN THE TANK IS FULL. THE NEWEST ISSUE IS THAT MY SPEEDOMETER IS NOW STUCK ON 80 WHEN THE CAR IS PARKED AND IS WELL OVER THE 120MPH WHEN I AM DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW FAST I AM GOING. THIS IS THE WORSE OF THE THREE BECAUSE I OR SOMEONE COULD BE INJURED BY THIS. TO HAVE PEOPLE ON THE ROAD WITH UNSAFE VEHICLES AND THE MANUFACTURE NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE IS RIDICULOUS TO SAY THE LEAST. THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVING THIS ISSUE AND I AM NOT SURE WHY THIS HAS NOT.  BEEN RECALLED. I HOPE IT DOES NOT TAKE SOMEONE BEING KILLED BEFORE SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING! *TR",
