ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY MY HUSBAND ASKED IF THE SEAT USUALLY LIFTS A CERTAIN WAY LIKE THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE DRIVER SEAT LIFTS LAST, AND IT KIND OF TILTS TO THE RIGHT. SO I WAS DRIVING TO WORK AND I WORK ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES FROM HOME AND THE SEAT STARTED TO SHIFT FRONTWARD AND BACKWARD ON THE RIGHT SIDE THIS IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND IT FEELS A BIT DANGEROUS TO DRIVE WITH THE SEAT LIKE THIS. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW AND WHY THIS HAPPENED. AND I HAVE ONLY HAD THE CAR SINCE DECEMBER  OF LAST YEAR.",
