THIS PART IS DEFECTIVE IN ALL 2001 AND 2002 VOLKSWAGENS AND AUDIS WITH 1.8-LITER, 4-CYLINDER, TURBOCHARGED ENGINES. THOSE ENGINES ARE FOUND IN AUDI A4S AND TTS AND IN VOLKSWAGEN JETTAS, PASSATS, NEW BEETLES, AND GOLF GTIS.      WE HAVE HAD 2 COILS FAIL IN 2 SEPERATE INSTANCES, IN THE PAST 6 MONTHS.  IN ADDITION TO BEING AN INCONVENIENCE, BOTH INSTANCES WERE DANGEROUS AS THE CAR EITHER LOST POWER OR SHUT DOWN WHILE ON THE EXPRESSWAY.    VW DEALERSHIPS HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO REPLACE THE DEFECTIVE COIL UNTIL IT ACTUALLY FAILS (WHICH IS JUST A MATTER OF TIME).  THEY SAY UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS OFFICIALLY RECALLED, THEY CAN AND WILL DO NOTHING BUT THE BARE MINIMUM.",
