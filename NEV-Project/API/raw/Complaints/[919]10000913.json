        "summary": "1999 JAYCO LIGHT HAWK THE FLOOR ON OUR 3 YEAR OLD CAMPER IS MILDEWED IT BECAUSE IT WAS BUILT WRONG.JAYCO DID NOT WRAP THE WATERPROOFING MATERIAL HIGH ENOUGH INTO THE WALLS.WHICH LEAVES US WITH A CAMPER WITH A MILDEWED AND ROTTING FLOOR.WE HAVE TAKEN CARE OF THIS CAMPER.WE STILL OWE ON THIS UNIT .WE WANT THEM TO BUYT IT BACK NOT JUST FIX IT AND LEAVE US OUT TO DRY.THEY WILL NOT WARRANTY THE WORK. THEY WILL NOT FIX ANY FUTURE PROBLEMS WITHOUT IT BEING BROUGHT BACK TO THEM FOR AN ASSESMENT.DID WE NEGLECT THE CAMPER AFTER IT WAS FIXED??? OR IS IT BECAUSE JAYCO HAS TO COMPLETELY REMOVE THE SIDES,ROOF AND EVERYTHING INSIDE THE CAMPER TO REPAIR THE FLOOR??????? THIS TO ME SOUNDS LIKE LET THE CONSUMER PAY FOR OUR ERRORS ,NOT WE MADE A MISTAKE LET US MAKE IT RIGHT!!! IF YOU WERE TOLD WE ARE GOING TO TAKE APART YOUR CAMPER,THAT IS CREWED ANDS STAPLED TOGETHER AND THEN PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN WOULD YOU WANT IT BACK (NO WARRANTY  OR GAURANTEES THAT IT WON'T LEAK OR FALL APART GOING DOWN THE ROAD.IF WE TRADE IT IN THE DEALERS WILL ONLY GIVE US WHOLESALE BECAUSE THEY KNEW ABOUT THE PROBLEM.WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED BY JAYCO. THEY HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM SINCE 18 MONTHS AFTER WE BOUGHT OUR CAMPER ( WE HAVE HAD IT 3 YEARS)",
