IT BROKE DOWN WHEN IT HAD JUST 9,221 MILES ON IT SHOWING \"ENGINE FAILURE\" ON NOV. 09, 2010.  THE SUBARU DEALER WHO FIXED IT AFTER LOT OF HASSLE, STATED IN HIS INVOICE AS SOME \"COIL\" IS CRACKED IN THE IGNITION.  I CAN SEND YOU THE RECEIPT THAT I HAVE IN MY POSSESSION FOR YOUR RECORD.  I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS AND WANT SUBARU TO COVER ANY SUCH PROBLEMS WITH ITS ENGINE FOR ANOTHER 1 YEARS FREE OF COST.  I SHALL CONSIDER REPORTING THIS FAILURE OF THE CAR VIA INTERNET TO MAKE AWRY OF OTHER PROSPECTIVE AND SUBARU OWNERS, IF I DO NOT GET A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE WITHIN 10 DAYS.
