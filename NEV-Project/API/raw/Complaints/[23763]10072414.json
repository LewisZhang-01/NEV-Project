CONTACTED NISSAN AND STATED THEY HAD NO IDEA OF THE PROBLEM---SHADY IF YOU ASK ME. THE SOUND PACKAGE COST $1800 DOLLARS, BUT THE SIMPLE RADIO SOUNDS LIKE A FIVE DOLLAR STEREO. ALSO THE SYTSEM IS SUPPOSED TO BE MADE BY ROCKFORD FOSGATE, BUT THE AMPLIFIER IS LABELED MADE BY CLARION, THE SUBWOOOFER IS LABELED MADE BY CLARION, AND THE HEADUNIT/CHANGER IS LABELED MADE BY PANASONIC. I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED AS THIS IS THE REASON I BOUGHT THE PACKAGE AS IT WAS SUPPOSED TO MADE BY A QUALITY MANUFACTURER LIKE FOSGATE",
