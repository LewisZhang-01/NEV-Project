IT SOUNDED LIKE A HIGH-PITCHED DENTIST'S DRILL THAT ONLY GETS WORSE WHEN WHEEL IS TURNED. NOT SURE HOW LONG ELECTRIC POWER STEERING SYSTEM WILL LAST. AFTER THREE WEEKS, DEALER AGREED TO ACCEPT CAR BACK AND SWAP IT FOR ANOTHER ONE. APPARENTLY, THERE IS NO FIX FOR THIS. DEGRADATION IN QUALITY AND SAFETY IS NOTED ON THE 2015 NISSAN ALTIMA.WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER NISSAN AGAIN.  *TR",
