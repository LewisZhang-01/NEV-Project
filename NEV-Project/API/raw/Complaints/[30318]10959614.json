THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN GARAGED 80% OF THE TIME. THIS IS NOT NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR, AS I HAVE HAD VEHICLES OLDER THAN THIS ONE AND HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED DETERIORATION OF THE MIRROR. THE PROBLEM STARTED IN 2010 AND IS GETTING WORSE. I CAN BARELY SEE OUT OF THE MIRROR. THE \"FIX\" IS TO REPLACE THE MIRROR AT A COST OF NEARLY $1300.00. IT APPEARS AS THIS IS A COMMON COMPLAINT FOR OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE.",
