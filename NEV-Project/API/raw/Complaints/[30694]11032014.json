REPAIRED JAN 2016 UNDER CUST SATISFACTION PROGRAM 13N02 BY FORD, LIKELY TO AVOID A REAL RECALL.  REPLACEMENT BOOSTER HAS NOW FAILED ALMOST CAUSING ANOTHER ACCIDENT AFTER A YEAR AND 1/2 AND 15K MILES AS WIFE HAD TO RUN OFF ROAD TO AVOID STOPPED TRAFFIC BECAUSE SHE HAD NO BRAKES.  WHY HAS NHTSA NOT FORCED A RECALL?  IT IS LITERALLY IS A SITUATION WHERE THOUSANDS OF THESE CARS ARE ROLLING AROUND WITH ADULTS AND YOUNG DRIVERS NOT KNOWING THAT AT SOME POINT THEY'LL NEED TO STOP AND THEY WILL HAVE ZERO BRAKES.  IS ANYBODY READING THESE?  YES IF YOU PUSH TO THE FLOOR HARD AND HOLD IT TIGHT IT WILL EVENTUALLY STOP AS A CRUDE MANUAL BRAKE.  KIDS HAVE NEVER DRIVEN A CAR WITHOUT POWER BRAKES! THE REST OF US AREN'T EXPECTING IT SINCE NO WARNING SIGNS.  FORD IS SIMPLY INSTALLING THE SAME DEFECTIVE PART ENDANGERING LIVES.  WHAT DO WE DO, SELL THE CAR AND PUT SOMEONE ELSE AT RISK SINCE THE REPLACEMENT PARTS ARE THE SAME FAULTY CRAP?",
