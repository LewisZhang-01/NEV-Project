I FOUND THE RECALL FOR REPLACING THE CLOCKSPRING IN THE STEERING WHEEL AND THIS COULD CAUSE MY PROBLEMS PLUS CAUSE MY AIR BAG TO NOT DEPLOY IN AN ACCIDENT. I CONTACTED THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD MY  # (*)WAS NOT INCLUDED AND TO CALL CHRYSLER, WHICH I DID. I WAS TOLD THE SAME THING AND THAT I SHOULD TAKE IT TO BE FIXED AND THEN IF IT WERE ADDED TO THE RECALL I WOULD BE REIMBURSED. I DON'T FEEL I SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS REPAIR AND I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR IT. WHAT HAPPENS IF I'M IN AN ACCIDENT LIKE THE ONES I'VE READ IN SOME OF THESE OTHER COMPLAINTS AND MY AIR BAG DOES NOT DEPLOY. IS IT JUST SOL OR CAN I SUE CHRYSLER? I FEEL THEY SHOULD INCLUDE MINE AND THE OTHERS IN THE RECALL. *TR",
