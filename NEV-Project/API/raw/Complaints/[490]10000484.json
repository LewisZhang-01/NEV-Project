TRANSMISSION SHIFTS HARD IN 1ST AND 2ND GEAR.  STEERING HAS MOMENTARY OVERSTEER, CAUSING THE FEELING OF SLIPPING ON ICE (SAFETY CONCERN AS NO CONTROL OVER VEHICLE), REPLACED ROTORS THREE TIMES, REPLACED FUEL SENDING AND WIRING UNIT (WIRES HAD ACTUALLY MELTED INSIDE THE GAS TANK!!).   WHAT NEXT!!!! THIS VEHICLE ONLY HAS 73,000 ON IT.  WE DO NOT PULL ANYTHING BEHIND IT, SO FEEL THAT TRANNY SHOULD NOT HAVE FAILED.  WHY WILL CHEVROLET NOT RECALL THESE PROBLEMS? HAVE HEARD OTHERS SAY THAT THE RADIATOR IS NOT BIG ENOUGH TO HANDLE COOLING THE ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION, ESSENTIALLY CAUSING EARLY TRANSMISSION FAILURE DUE TO OVERHEATING.  CHEVROLET NEEDS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BEFORE THERE IS  LOSS OF LIFE OR A BAD ACCIDENT. TS",
