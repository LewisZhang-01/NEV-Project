IN RESEARCHING MY PROBLEM IT HAS BECOME APPARENT THAT THE 850 VOLVO IS KNOWN FOR FAILURES TO ITS ABS MODULE AND THE ENTIRE BRAKING SYSTEM IN GENERAL. THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND ON THIS COMMON PROBLEM LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOULD BE A RECALLED ITEM. APPARENTLY VOLVO NOW OFFERS A NEW AND IMPROVED ABS CONTROL MODULE (THAT THEY CHARGE DEARLY FOR) BECAUSE OF THE NUMEROUS PROBLEMS AND REPLACEMENTS OF THE OLD UNITS. VOLVO SHOULD BEAR THE EXPENSE OF REPLACING THESE UNITS AS IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND THE SHEAR NUMBER OF THESE INSTANCES LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS A SYSTEMATIC DESIGN FLAW.       *JB",
