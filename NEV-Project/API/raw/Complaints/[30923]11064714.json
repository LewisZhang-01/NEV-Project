I ONLY HAVE 13,900 MILES ON MY TIRES AND THE TREADS SPLITTING, CRACKING AND PEELING HORRIBLY  THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE WARRANTIED FOR 50,000 MILES.  I WENT TO MY FORD DEALERSHIP ABOUT THE TIRES AND THEY CONTACTED HANKOOK AND THEY ARE PRO-RATING MY TIRES AS 50% TREAD WORN AND GOING TO MAKE ME PAY FOR 2 NEW TIRES BUT SAID THEY ARE DISCOUNTING THEM BUT WITH ME PRICING THE TIRES THEY AREN'T.  TIRES AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THIS LESS THAN 14,000 MILES.  I SAW OTHER COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER PEOPLE ON HOW HORRIBLE THE TIRES ARE AND THE SAME HAPPENING WITH THEM.  I WOULD OF NEVER KNOWN THIS IF IT WASN'T TO CHECK MY TIRES AND THE PERSON AT THE TIRE PLACE TOLD ME HOW BAD THE TIRES ARE.",
