I BELIEVE THAT FOR A CAR THAT HAS HAD NO ACCIDENT DAMAGE AND HAS THIS AMOUNT OF MILEAGE ON IT, THAT THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING. AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF I CAN EXPECT MORE OF THE SAME AND IF THIS WAS/IS A SAFETY ISSUE? I DRIVE ABOUT 5000 MILES A YEAR MYSELF.  I AM NOT TO PLEASE WITH THIS CAR AT THE PRESENT TIME BECAUSE OF THE ABOVE AM I AM WONDERING IF, I SHOULD CUT MY LOSSES AND SELL IT.  *NLM",
