AAA TOWED MY CAR TO THE NEAREST AUTO CENTER, WHERE AFTER THE  COMPLETE INSPECTION \"BOB AUTO TECH\" TOLD ME THAT THE CRANK SHAFT OF MY CAR WAS BROKEN. I WAS SHOCKED AND SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT, AND I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT. MY CAR IS ONLY 4 YEARS OLD, AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF BY ME BY REGULAR SERVICING AND OIL CHANGE AND ALWAYS AT VW AUTHORIZED DEALERSHIPS/WORKSHOPS. I ENDED UP PAYING UP BILLS WORTH $3194.82 FROM MY POCKET AS IT WAS NOT COVERED BY THE INSURANCE ALSO.
