I BOUGHT THIS FROM AN  INDIVIDUAL JUST THREE MONTHS AGO, AND I AM TOLD THAT THIS WILL BE ANYWHERE FROM $1,550.00 TO $2,000.00 TO FIX THIS.  I AM REQUESTING AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS MODEL OF VAN (ASTRO), AND SEEING IF THIS WILL BE A RECALL AND FIXED AT THERE EXPENSE.I FEEL A VAN WITH ONLY 23,OOO MILES ON IT SHOULD NOT HAVE THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM.*AK",
