MY HUSBAND BARELY MANAGED TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE AND PULL ONTO THE SHOULDER. WE DECIDED TO TRY TO DRIVE TO THE NEAREST TOWN THAT WAS ABOUT 20 MILES AWAY. WE PROCEEDED AT ABOUT 40 MPH WITH OUR BLINKERS ON AND AFTER HITTING A VERY SMALL BUMP IN THE ROAD THE TRUCK SHOOK VIOLENTLY AGAIN. WE REFUSED TO DRIVE THE TRUCK ANY FURTHER AND CALLED FOR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE. THE TRUCK IS CURRENTLY IN THE SHOP AT THIS TIME AND THE MECHANIC SAID AFTER INSPECTION THAT THE FRONT END WASN'T BOLTED IN. (?) HE SAID THEY ARE COMPLETELY REPLACING THE FRONT AXLE. WE HAVE YET TO OBTAIN  OUR SCARY NEW TRUCK FROM THE DODGE MECHANIC AND WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE BETTER INFORMATION REGARDING THE EXACT PROBLEM IF NEED BE. FORTUNATELY THERE WASN'T ANY FIRE, CRASH OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, BUT PLEASE DON'T LET THAT BE THE ONLY REASON THIS ISN'T INVESTIGATED FURTHER. IT WAS TRULY A FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE AND THE END RESULT COULD HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC FOR OUR FAMILY.  PLEASE DON'T HESITATE TO CALL WITH ANY QUESTIONS.    *NLM",
