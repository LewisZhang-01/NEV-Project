THE COIL OR COILPACK FAILS DUE TO POOR MANUFACTURE OR DESIGN. IN SOME CASES MULTIPLE CYLINDERS WILL LOOSE POWER. I LOST CYLINDER #1 WHEN ACCELERATING AWAY FROM AN INTERSECTION. I LOST CYLINDER #2 WHILE ATTEMPTING TO MERGE WITH TRAFFIC ON SURFACE STREETS. IN BOTH CASES THE SIGNIFICANT LOSE OF HORSEPOWER COULD HAVE CAUSED ME TO REMAIN IN AN INTERSECTION LONGER THAN EXPECTED AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. VW IS CURRENTLY REPLACING FAILED COILS FREE OF CHARGE AND PROVIDING RENTAL CARS WHEN A REPLACEMENT CANNOT BE PERFORMED IMMEDIATELY. HOWEVER, VW WILL NOT REPLACE ALL COILS, JUST THOSE THAT FAIL. THIS LEAVES THE OTHERS TO FAIL AND POTENTIALLY CAUSE ACCIDENTS. I MUST DRIVE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I COULD LOSE POWER FROM ONE OR MORE CYLINDERS AT ANY TIME. THIS IS ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND HEAVY TRAFFIC OR WHEN CROSSING ANY INTERSECTION WHERE CROSS-TRAFFIC HAS THE RIGHT-OF-WAY.",
