THE SATURN MANUFACTURER WILL NOT FIX THE CRACKED CYLINDER HEAD ON MY SW1 BECAUSE IT IS OUT OF WARRENTY.  MY CAR ONLY HAS 69,000 MILES ON IT.  A CYLINER HEAD SHOULD NOT CRACK - ESCPECIALLY WITH ONLY 69,000 MILES.   THEY KNOW ABOUT THIS ISSUE, EVEN WROTE TWO TECHNICAL BULLETONS ON IT.  I THINK SATURN SHOULD HAVE NOTIFIED CONSTOMERS AND THEY SHOULD FIX MY CAR FREE OF CHARGE.",
