THERE ISN'T A SPOT OF RUST OR STRUCTURAL DAMAGE ON THIS VEHICLE EXCEPT THAT STRUT TOWER.  FROM MY DISCUSSION WITH A CHRYSLER BODY SHOP MANAGER, IT APPEARS THAT THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THESE STRUT TOWERS.  I THINK THIS IS A SAFETY RISK BECAUSE IF ONE OF THESE LETS GO AT HIGHWAY SPEED, IT WILL IMMEDIATELY IMPACT STEERING AND DRIVEABILITY POTENTIALLY LEADING TO A CRASH.  I KNOW MY WAY AROUND A CAR SO I WAS ABLE TO SPOT THIS PROBLEM AND RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL DANGER.  I THINK WITH MOST DRIVERS THIS PROBLEM WILL GO UNRECOGNIZED AND THAT IS WHY I AM WRITING YOU TODAY.  PLEASE GET THE WORD OUT.  I CALLED CHRYSTER AND REGISTERED A COMPLAINT, BUT I DON'T EXPECT THEM TO INFORM ANYONE.",
