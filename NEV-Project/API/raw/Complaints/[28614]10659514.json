THIS IS THE 2ND HONDA CRV THAT WE OWN THAT MAKES THIS SAME NOISE. WHEN I PERFORM A GOOGLE SEARCH I FIND SIMILAR COMPLAINTS FROM MANY HONDA CRV OWNERS FROM MULTIPLE YEARS OF MANUFACTURE OF THE HONDA CRV. THE DEALER HAS INDICATED THAT THIS NOISE ISSUE IS CAUSED BY THE VARIABLE TIMING CONTROL VALVE (VTC) AND THAT HONDA IS WORKING ON A PERMANENT SOLUTION. HONDA HAS BEEN AWARE OF NOISE ISSUE AND SUPPOSEDLY WORKING ON A SOLUTION FOR AT LEAST 2 MODEL YEARS YET NO PERMANENT SOLUTION TO ISSUE HAS BEEN PROVIDED AT THIS TIME. HONDA IS CURRENTLY MANUFACTURING AND SELLING CRV'S TO CONSUMERS WITH A KNOWN ENGINE DEFECT AND SHOULD BE MADE TO EXTEND THE ENGINE WARRANTY UNTIL THIS ISSUE IS CORRECTED.  *TR",
