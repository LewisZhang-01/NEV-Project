DEALER RELACED COMPLETE CLUCH ASSEMBLY INCLUDING THE SLAVE CYLINDER. ALSO AT THIS TIME THEY NOTICED THAT THE AIR BAG SWITCH WAS NOT FUNCTIONING PRORERLY. THIS SWITCH HAD BEEN TURNED OFF AT TIME OF DELIVERY AND WAS NEVER TURNED ON AGAIN. HOW CAN THIS SWITCH FAIL UNDER THIS CONDITION? THIS TRUCK IS DRIVEN OVER THE ROAD AND WELL MAINTAINED. I DON'T FEEL THAT I SHOULD BE HAVING THIS MUCH TROUBLE WHEN THE CLUTCH IS NOT USED AS MUCH AS IF IT WERE USED FOR IN TOWN OR SUBURAN DRIVING.  I FEEL THAT THIS MODEL AND YEAR HAS A FAULTY CLUTCH AND AIR BAG SYSTEM.",
