RECENTLY MY INTERMITTENT WINDSHIELD WIPER FUNCTION STOPPED WORKING COMPLETELY AND WHEN ENGAGING WIPERS AT FULL CAPACITY UPON TURNING THEM OFF THE WIPERS WILL STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDSHIELD. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE I HAD MY DEALER RUSSEL MAZDA TROUBLESHOOT; THEY IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM AS A \"SHORT\" IN AN ALARM CONTROL RELAY BUT DIDN'T INDICATE WHAT WAS CAUSING  THE SHORT- I SUSPECT MY WIPERS ARE NO LONGER RELIABLE AND COULD GO OUT AT ANY TIME WHICH COULD HAVE FATAL CONSEQUENCES IN A BAD RAINSTORM. MY VEHICLE WENT OUT OF WARRANTY IN SEPTEMBER OF 2002 AND THE DEALER QUOTED $306 TO REPLACE THE MALFUNCTIONING RELAY; I DISCUSSED THE MATTER WITH THE ISUZU CORPORATE PERSONNEL AND WITH THE LOCAL DEALER WHO IN TURN CONTACTED THE ISUZU AREA REP WHO SAID IT'S OUT OF WARRANT AND HE COULDN'T PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE. I'VE HAD SEVERAL OTHER RECALLS ON MY ISUZU AND FEEL THIS COULD BE A MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT MIGHT ULTIMATELY  IMPACT OTHER VEHICLES AND RESULT IN ACCIDENTS,I.E., THIS WIPER  RELAY SHORT  PROBLEM MIGHT BE A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE FOR A SAFETY RECALL.",
