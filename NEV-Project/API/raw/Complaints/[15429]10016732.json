ON 2 OCCASIONS WHERE SOMEONE ELSE PARKED MY CAR AND ONLY USED THE E BRAKE AND DIDNT PUT IT IN GEAR, WE FOUND MY CAR HALFWAY IN THE ROAD (STOPPED) AND THEN ACTUALLY WATCHED IT AS IT STARTED ROLLING BACKWARDS ONE NIGHT. WHEN I GET IN MY CAR TO START IT BEFORE PUSHING IN THE CLUTCH I HAVE TO MAKE SURE MY FOOT IS FIRM ON THE BRAKE OR THE CAR WILL START ROLLING BACKWARDS. I HAD IT TIGHTENED AT THE DEALER AND HAVE DONE IT A FEW TIMES SINCE MYSELF AFTER BEING SHOWN HOW ONLY TO HAVE IT REVERT TO ITS NON FUNCTIONAL STATE EACH TIME.",
