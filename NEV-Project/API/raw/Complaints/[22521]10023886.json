        "summary": "FROM THE DAY OF PURCHASE THE BELT TENSIONER HAS BEEN SQUEAKING.  I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER AT LEAST 10 TIMES. INITIALLY THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY TIGHTENED AND THAT IT WAS FIXED.  AFTER ABOUT A YEAR THEY AGREED TO REPLACE THE BELT.  I DON'T KNOW IF THEY EVER HAVE.  AFTER I MOVED TO ST. PAUL I TOOK IT TO A NEW DEALER, AND WAS TOLD THAT IT IS A SELF TIGHTENING BELT AND CANNOT BE TIGHTENED.  FOR THE PAST 2 1/2 YEARS IT HAS GOTTEN CONSISTENTLY WORSE, AND NO ONE WILL DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  ALSO, UPON STARTING, THE CAR BOGS, HAS SOME SORT OF LOSS OF POWER.  THIS CAN BE DANGEROUS WHEN PULLING OUT IN TRAFFIC.  THERE IS ALSO A KNOCKING IN THE ENGINE AND WHEN IDLING, THE RPM'S JUMP AROUND ERRATICALLY.  I HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS FOR OVER 2 YEARS, YET NONE OF THE DEALERS WILL DO ANYTHING ABOUT ANY OF IT.  *JB",
