        "summary": "SEAT BELT PROBLEM WITH 1999 MERCEDES S500.  SEAT BELT WOULD NOT RETRACT.  I CALLED MERCEDES BENZ TECHNICAL SUPPORT (TWICE) TO ASK IF THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THEIR SEAT BELTS.  THEIR IMMEDIATE RESPONSE WAS THAT THEY HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT SEAT BELT FAILURE.  WHEN I TOOK THE CAR TO MY AUTO REPAIR SHOP, WHICH SPECIALIZES IN MERCEDES BENZ ONLY, I WAS TOLD THAT THEY REPLACE MANY SEAT BELTS.  LAST NIGHT WE WENT TO DINNER WITH FRIENDS WHO WERE DRIVING A 1994 SE MERCEDES - WHEN WE GOT OUT OF THE CAR, I NOTICED THAT THE DRIVER'S SEAT BELT WAS NOT RETRACTING AND WAS HANGLNG LOOSELY IN THE SEAT (THE SAME WAY MINE WAS BEFORE I HAD IT REPLACED LAST WEEK).  IT COST ME $375 TO HAVE THE SEAT BELT REPLACED - IF IT HAD BEEN SOME OTHER FAILURE ON THE CAR, I WOULD NOT FEEL SO BADLY.  BUT I FEEL THAT A SEAT BELT SHOULD LAST MORE THAN 3 TO 4 YEARS!!  WE HAVE A 1981 JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE THAT WE BOUGHT NEW - THE SEAT BELT IS STILL WORKING JUST FINE.  IN FACT, I HAVE OWNED MANY CARS AND NEVER HAD A SEAT BELT FAILURE.  THIS IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED.",
