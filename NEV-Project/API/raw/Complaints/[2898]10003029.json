        "summary": "MY WIFE & I OWN A 1999 PONTIAC MONTANA.  IN SEPTEMBER WITH 53,000 MILES WE NOTICED THAT THE LOW COOLANT LIGHT CAME ON.  WE ADDED COOLANT AND ABOUT 2 WEEKS LATER THE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN.  I THEN CONTACTED MY PERSONAL MECHANIC (SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY).   HE TOLD ME THAT THE INTAKE MANIFOLD WAS BAD AND THAT THIS WAS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS TYPE OF ENGINE.  HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT GM DEALERS TOLD HIM THAT IT WAS A RESULT OF THE INTAKE MANIFOLD BEING MADE OF PLASTIC AND THAT THE DEXCOOL WAS EATING UP THE GASKETS AND THE PLASTIC MANIFOLDS.  THE COST OF THE REPAIR ON THE INTAKE PORTION OF THE ENGINE WAS $392.57.   HE ALSO TOLD US THAT AS A RESULT OF THIS, COOLANT SPILLED INTO OUR ENGINE OIL. THIS MEANS THAT WE HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF ENGINE FAILURE IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE ENGINE. REPLACING THE ENGINE WOULD COST $2000 -$2500.  WE DID CONTACT THE DEALER WHERE WE BOUGHT THE VEHICLE AND POSTED A COMPLAINT.  THEY TOLD US TO CONTACT PONTIAC.  WE DID CALL THE PONTIAC CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER IN MICHIGAN AN FILED A COMPLAINT OVER THE PHONE.  THEY CLAIMED THAT THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING.  PLEASE RESPOND.  THANKS",
