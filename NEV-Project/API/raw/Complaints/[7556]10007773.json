        "summary": "MY 1998 MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE HAS HAD SEVERAL PROBLEMS FROM THE TIME IT WAS PURCHASED.  AT 50,000 MILES THE ENGINE HEAD GASKET HAD TO BE REPLACED. AND TODAY THE ENGINE HAS A ROD THROWN AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD I WILL HAVE TO REPLACE THE WHOLE ENGINE.  I HAD THE CAR IN SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE THE HEAD GASKET WAS REPLACED BECAUSE THE OIL LIGHT CAME ON AND OFF AND WAS TOLD IT WAS JUST A SENSOR.  AFTER THAT THE LIGHT STILL CAME ON AND OFF AND I WAS TOLD NOT TO WORRY.  THE DEALERSHIP COULD NOT FIND ANY PROBLEM.    OTHER PROBLEMS THAT I HAVE ENCOUNTERED  HAVE BEEN WITH THE BRAKES.  FREQUENT BRAKE PAD REPLACEMENT AND ROTORS TURNED AND REPLACED AFTER ONLY SEVERAL THOUSAND MILES.  THAT WAS BLAMED ON MY DRIVING HABITS.  I HAVE RESEARCHED AND FOUND THAT ALL ECLIPSE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES.  WHY ISN'T SOMETHING BEING DONE?   ALSO OIL LEAKS AND ENGINE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCH I HAVE DONE.  WHAT DOES THE MANUFACTUERS WARRANTY COVER IF IT DOES NOT COVER THE ENGINE.  IN MY OPINION, AFTER 50,000 MILES A CAR SHOULD NOT HAVE TO HAVE A HEAD GASKET REPLACED IF THE MAINTENANCE HAS BEEN DONE AS REQUESTED BY THE MANUFACTER.  ON JULY 31, 2002 TOOK CAR TO DEALERSHIP TO HAVE OIL LEAK CHECKED AND SERVICE DEPT. UNABLE TO LOCATE OIL LEAK.  ADVISED TO  HAVE TRANSMISSION CHECKED. TRANSMISSION SERVICED BY DEALERSHIP.  STILL HAD PROBLEMS WITH OIL LIGHT COMING ON AND OFF.  COULD THIS DEFECT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHY MY ENGINE THREW A ROD THROUGH IT AND HAS MADE MY CAR WORTHLESS?    THIS CAR IS ONLY 4 YEARS OLD?  AND STILL BEING PAID ON.",
