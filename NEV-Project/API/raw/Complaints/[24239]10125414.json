        "summary": "PICKING UP MY DAUGHTER AT A FRIENDS HOUSE AND FORTUNATELY WAS ONLY GOING ABOUT 5-10MPH TO A STOP SIGN WHEN MY BRAKES FAILED WITHOUT WARNING.  I HAD TO PUT MY ENTIRE BODY WEIGHT ON THE PEDAL TO SLOW THE VEHICLE DOWN.  THE CAR WAS TOWED BY FLATBED TO DEALERSHIP AND DETERMINED IT WAS THE BRAKE BOOSTER ASSEMBLY.  AT THE SAME TIME MY FUEL INJECTOR ASSEMBLY APPARENTLY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED WHICH I HAD NO IDEA OF UNTIL I RECIEVED MY WORK ORDER SHEET.  I WAS ACCUSED OF USING CHEAP GAS WHICH I ABSOLUTELY NEVER USED. I ONLY USE THE HIGHEST GRADE OF FUEL IN MY VEHICLE SO THEY COULD GIVE ME NO OTHER REASON FOR THE COINCIDENCE.  IT SEEMS LIKE MANY 2004 RX330'S HAVE BEEN HAVE ALOT OF BRAKE ISSUES BUT LEXUS' ANSWER TO THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF THE PROBLEM CAN BE FIXED THEN THE CAR IS RUNNING ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS.  MY QUESTION TO THEM WAS CAN THEY  FIX THE PROBLEM OF THE LOSS OF A LIFE WHEN THIS UNSAFE VEHICLE PRODUCES THAT PROBLEM? I HAVE ALSO HAD TO HAVE BRAKE ROTOR PADS REPLACED AT 15,000 MILES WHICH ACCORDING TO THE SERVICE TECH WAS OUT OF THE ORDINARY BUT NOT ACCORDING TO A LEXUS CUSTOMER SATISFACTION ADMINISTRATOR.  I FIND IT APPALLING THAT LEXUS IS NOT STANDING BEHIND ITS PRODUCT TO HAVE THESE UNSAFE VEHICLES TAKEN OFF THE ROAD INSTEAD THEY ARE WILLING TO RISK CONSUMERS LIVES NATIONWIDE.... SO MUCH FOR CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.",
