HAPPENS WITH WARNING.  THIS IS THE 3RD TIME IN 3 MONTHS THIS HAS HAPPENED.  CALLED DODGE DEALER AND CHRYSLER CORPORATE AND THEY SAY THERE IS A RECALL THAT IS SIMILAR FOR THE IGNITION SWITCH, BUT NO PART AVAILABLE AND NO ESTIMATE WHEN.  THEY ADVISE USING FOB WITHOUT KEYS ATTACHED.  THIS LAST OCCURRENCE OCCURRED WITH NO KEYS ATTACHED, ONLY THE FOB  IN THE IGNITION, SO THEIR WORK AROUND DOES NOT WORK.  NOTE THE ONLY WAY WE EVEN KNOW IT HAS STALLED IT THE SUDDEN LOSS OF STEERING, UNTIL WE CAN GET IT STOPPED AND REALIZE THE ENGINE IS NOT RUNNING.  THERE IS NO OTHER WARNING ITS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.  TIME BETWEEN THE THREE OCCURRENCES WERE  EARLY DEC 2014 FOR FIRST OCCURRENCE, 1 WEEK LATER FOR SECOND OCCURRENCE, 2.5 MONTHS LATER FOR 3RD OCCURRENCE.  A FIX IS NEEDED IMMEDIATELY FOR THIS AND IT SEEMS THIS \"RECALL WITHOUT A FIX\" IS JUST SITTING THERE INDEFINITELY.  *TR",
