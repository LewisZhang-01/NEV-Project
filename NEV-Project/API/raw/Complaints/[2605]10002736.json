        "summary": "I OWNED A PONTIAC AZTEK 2001. I USE TO NOTICE THIS CAR / SUV FREQUENTLY SWAYED WITH BREEZE - MORE SO THAN OTHER CARS I HAVE DRIVEN. ON A WINDY DAY AROUND 10:30 PM NIGHT WHILE DRIVING WITH FAMILY ON A FREEWAY (US23 S) NEAR FENTON MI, WE NOTICED EXCESSIVE FREEZING WINDS CAUSING THE THE CAR TO SWAY ABNORMALLY. FINALLY  IT SWAYED WITH THE BREEZE PUSHING THE CAR TO THE NEXT LANE ( I WAS ON THE FAST LANE ON THE TWO LANE FREWAY) BUT INSTEAD OF RETURNING BACK.. IT CONTINUED THE SLIDE.  IT APPEARS WE HIT A PATCH OF BLACK ICE AND WITH THE FORCE OF THE WIND WE STARTED SLIDE. THE CAR WAS SLIDING NEARLY AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE DIAGONALLY CROSS BOTH THE LANES AND CONTINUED IN THIS MANNER FOR AT LEAST 50 - 100 FT. FINALLY WIHTOUT USING THE BRAKES I MANAVEURED IT TO THE MEDIAN. MOMENT IT HIT THE MEDIAN THE FRONT TIRE UNDER ME (DRIVER) HIT A SOFT PATCH AND THE AR ROLE OVER TWICE AND FELL ON THE DRIVER SIDE CLOSE TO THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC LANES.  LUCKILY ALL OF US I WAS BELTED SO WAS MY WIFE, ESCAPED UN HURT. MY CHILD 3 YRS OLD WAS BELTED ON THE CAR SEAT. NONE OF THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYED. A MAJOR DENT JUST OVER MY HEAD WHERE THE CAR ROLLED OVER.  FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPUSES THE CAR WAS TRASHED WITH HARDLY 7000 MILES ON IT.",
