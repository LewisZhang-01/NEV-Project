IT MAY ONLY OPEN HALF WAY AND STOP, THEN EITHER CLOSE OR NOT AT ALL UNLESS DONE MANUALLY. CERTAIN TIMES IT OPENS AND DOES NOT CLOSE AT ALL, OR SLOWLY AT FIRST AND THEN STOPS. SOMETIMES IT DOES CLOSES BUT DOES NOT PULL ITSELF IN TOWARDS THE CAR TO LATCH SHUT. IT WONT DO IT FOR WEEKS THEN IT MAY DO IT ONCE OR MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY. ONCE HAD TO GO FOR 2 DAYS WITH JUST MANUAL DOORS AS THE ELECTRIC DID NOT RESPOND AT ALL, AND THEN FINALLY IT DID. ITS FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IT IS INTERMITTENT, AND I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND SHOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT AUTOMATIC DOORS SINCE THE ODYSSEY HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM EVER SINCE IT CAME OUT.",
