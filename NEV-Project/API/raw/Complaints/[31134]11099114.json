        "summary": "CAR LOST POWER AS WE WERE ON THE HIGHWAY, GOING FROM 70 TO 40 MPH IN NO TIME. STARTED TO SMOKE. JUST HAD OIL CHANGED AND ALL FLUIDS CHECKED WITHOUT ANY ISSUES. AFTER WE WERE TOWED OFF THE HIGHWAY AND WAITING WE DECIDED TO TRY THE CAR AGAIN TO SEE IF IT WAS WORKING. CAR WENT FINE THE REST OF THE WAY. COMING BACK HOME ABOUT 300 MILES, CAR DROVE OK, BUT IT FELT LIKE THERE WAS SOMETHING OFF. BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT IT NEEDS A NEW TRANSMISSION AS WELL AS A TRANSMISSION COOLER KIT. TOTAL WOULD BE $5200. CAR ONLY HAS 67000 MILES, PAID IN FULL AT TIME OF PURCHASE, WARRANTY EXPIRED AT 60000 MILES. CONTACTED NISSAN, I WAS TOLD OTHER YEARS HAD EXTENDED WARRANTY ON TRANSMISSION BUT NOT MY YEAR. ALSO FOUND OUT THAT THERE'S BEEN RECALLS ON OTHER YEARS REGARDING THE TRANSMISSION BUT NOT 2013. I SEE THERE ARE MANY, MANY COMPLAINTS ONLINE REGARDING THIS ISSUE. I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING MY CAR AND I REALLY THINK NISSAN SHOULD MAKE RESTITUTION ON THIS PROBLEM. I HAVE CONTACTED THEM AND WAITING FOR REGIONAL DEPARTMENT TO CONTACT ME TODAY.",
