THIS DEFECT PRECLUDES SAFE AND PROPER PLACEMENT OF A CHILD SAFETY SEAT IN THE BACK SEAT --> PLACING THE CHILD SAFETY SEAT IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN SINCE THERE IS NO \"OFF\" SWITCH FOR THE SRS.  I AM ALSO CONCERNED FOR THE SAFETY OF PASSENGERS IN THE REAR SEAT; IF THE SHOULDER BELT DOES NOT LOCK IN AN ACCIDENT, FORWARD MOTION KINETIC INJURY IS SURE TO RESULT AND WILL BE GREATER THAN IF THE SHOULDER BELT WORKED.",
