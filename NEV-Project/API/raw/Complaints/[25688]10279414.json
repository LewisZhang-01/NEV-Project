        "summary": "WHILE ENTERING THE HIGHWAY ON A CURVED RAMP THE POWER STEERING SUDDENLY AND COMPLETELY WENT OUT. IT WAS VERY VERY HARD TO STEER. AFTER TURNING THE CAR OFF AND RESTARTING IT THE POWER STEERING STARTING WORKING AGAIN. AFTER DRIVING THE CAR A SHORT DISTANCE, AGAIN SUDDENLY NO POWER STEERING. EVERY TIME THE CAR IS TURNED OFF IT RESETS THE POWER STEERING. IT WILL GO OUT ANYTIME, ANYWHERE AND IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. THIS SHOULD BE COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE BY THE SATURN MANUFACTURER. WILL PEOPLE HAVE TO DIE BEFORE A RECALL IS ISSUED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM? I BET IF THE CEO OF SATURN/GM OWNED A CAR WITH THIS PROBLEM AND HIS WIFE,DAUGHTER,SON OR MOTHER WAS DRIVING IT, A RECALL WOULD BE DONE IMMEDIATELY. THE CAR HAS NOT BEEN REPAIRED YET. THE COST OF REPAIR IS OVER $1000.00 FOR PARTS AND LABOR. HOW CONVENIENT FOR THE DEALER TO MAKE MONEY FROM A POSSIBLE DEADLY SITUATION. *TR",
