A SIMPLE GOOGLE SEARCH REVEALED A SUBARU SERVICE BULLETIN 09-36-03 \"FUEL SMELL IN COLD WEATHER\" WARNING OF THIS ISSUE WITH THE 2002 2.0L ENGINE.     THE PROBLEM IS CLEARLY MUCH MORE THAN A FUEL SMELL. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS LEAK THAT WILL EVENTUALLY CAUSE SOMEONE TO BE KILLED IN A FUEL FIRE. THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN FLAW AND A VERY DANGEROUS ONE AT THAT. A RECALL SHOULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED. I'D BE SURPRISED THERE ISN'T PENDING LITIGATION. *TR",
