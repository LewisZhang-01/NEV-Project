THE BRAKE DID NOT WORK AS GOOD AS IT DID BEFORE, I CAN NOTICE IT TOOK LONGER TO STOP.  AT THE DEALERSHIP, DRUM SURFACE WAS RECODED.  THE VAN HAD 3/4 OF THE BRAKE LEFT AND THE DRUM JUST NEEDED A RESURFACING CODING...  IT ONLY TAKES ONE HARD BRAKE FOR THE PROBLEM TO COME BACK ALL OVER AGAIN.  ONCE BACK THE BRAKE DOES NOT HOLDS ON THE TIRE LIKE IT DID PREVIOUSLY.  I HAVE GONE BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP, AND THEY TOLD ME THE ODDESSY HAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKE AND IT IS VERY COMMON BETWEEN ODDESSY DRIVES.  THE PROBLEM KEEPES COMING BACK, AND IT DOES NOT MAKE ME ANY SAFER BECAUSE IT IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR THE ODDESSY DRIVERS.  *CN",
