THEY ALSO ADMITTED TO CHANGING 6 OTHER TANKS FOR THAT REASON JUST LAST MONTH!(WITH FUEL PUMPS).THIS FLAW IS OBVIOUS TO THE DEALERS AND THEY AREN'T GOING TO BE CALLING YOU TO INITIATE A RECALL I WOULDN'T THINK;SO MAYBE SOME INVESTIGATION IS NECESSARY JUST TO VERIFY THE OBVIOUS.I'M $1300.00 IN THE HOLE FOR AN OBVIOUS MANUFACTURERS FLAW.PLEASE NOTIFY ME OF THE WHAT HAS TO BE RECALL(REIMBURSEMET). THANK YOU",
