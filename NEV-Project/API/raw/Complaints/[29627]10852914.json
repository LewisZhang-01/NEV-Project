        "summary": "\"TAKATA RECALL\"  I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE FROM ACURA THAT MY 2009 TL WAS BEING RECALLED FOR THE AIRBAG INFLATOR.  ON THE RECALL NOTICE IT STATES \"THE DEFECT IN THESE VEHICLES COULD KILL OR INJURE YOU OR OTHER PEOPLE IN YOUR VEHICLE\". IT ADVISES TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE DEALER TO HAVE A NEW AIRBAG ORDERED AND IF WANTED, RECEIVE ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION.  THE DEALER DID OFFER ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION WITH WHICH YOU AGREE TO PARK THE RECALLED VEHICLE UNTIL REPAIRS ARE MADE.  THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE DEALER ADVISED THEY HAVE NO PROCEDURES TO INSTALL THE NEW AIRBAG NOR DO THEY HAVE THE PARTS. THE DEALER ADVISED IT COULD TAKE UNTIL SEPTEMBER 2016 OR MAYBE EVEN LONGER, BEFORE THE REPAIR CAN BE MADE.  THE DEALER ADVISED THEY HAVE NO FURTHER INFORMATION BEYOND WHAT HAS JUST BEEN STATED.  IF MY CAR SITS FOR ANOTHER FIVE MONTHS OR LONGER THERE IS NO CONSIDERATION FOR THE DEPRECIATION OF MY VEHICLE WHILE IT IS PARKED.  WHY NOT?  ALSO, HOW GREAT IS THE HAZARD AS THE DEALER ADVISED SOME OWNERS ARE CONTINUING TO DRIVE THEIR VEHICLE AWAITING THE REPLACEMENT OF THE AIRBAG.  REMEMBER, THE RECALL NOTICE STATES \"THESE VEHICLES COULD KILL OR INJURE YOU\".  SO THE CONSUMER IS LEFT WITH THE DECISION TO RISK LIFE AND LIMB OR PARK THE VEHICLE WITH NO IDEA WHEN IT WOULD BE REPAIRED!  I CANNOT TRADE THE CAR WITH THIS RECALL NOTICE PENDING AND EXPECT TO GET FULL VALUE FOR IT.  ACURA ADVISED THEY WOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION OTHER THAN THE RENTAL CAR.  WHO IS NEGOTIATING ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER?  WHAT IS MY REAL RISK DRIVING THIS VEHICLE?  WHY WAS COMPENSATION NOT PART OF THE AGREED TO RECALL THAT WAS NEGOTIATED?  WHY IS THE NTSB LEAVING IT UP TO CONSUMERS TO ASSESS THE RISK TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY?  WHAT IS BEING DONE TO ACCELERATE THE REPLACEMENT OF THESE AIRBAGS?  I HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR OVER TWO YEARS IF MY VEHICLE HAD A TAKATA AIRBAG AND WAS TOLD THEY DID NOT KNOW.",
