MY HEATING IS STUCK IN HOT UNLESS MAX AIR IS TURNED ON. THERE IS NO IN BETWEEN. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT AN EXTREAM SAFTY ISSUE, IT IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE FOR MY INFANT CHILD. THE FORD DEALER WILL FIX IT BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IT WILL COST ARROUND $1000. I SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD THAT KIND OF MONEY TO FIX FORD'S DEFECTIVE PARTS.",
