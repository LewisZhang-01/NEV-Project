        "summary": "VEHICLE WAS BACKING  OUT OF DRIVEWAY, WHEN A LOUD NOISE PROCEEDED THE FRONT DRIVER SIDE OF THE VAN COLLAPSING ONTO THE FRONT TIRE. THE CHEVROLET DEALER INFORMED ME THAT THE TORSION BAR HAD FAILED, AND AS THE PART HAD BEEN REDESIGNED, THE PASSENGER SIDE WOULD ALSO BE REPLACED. I REQUESTED THE PARTS BE RETURNED, AND AFTER VISUALLY INSPECTING, IT IS VERY APPARENT THAT THE PART FAILED DUE TO SEVERE RUST AND CORROSION. THE ORIGINAL INSTALLATION OF THE TORSION BAR HAS A RETAINING SLEEVE THAT FITS OVER THE FAILED END OF THE TORSION BAR, AND CONNECTS INTO THE CROSSMEMBER. THE SLEEVE IS DESIGNED IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT COLLECTS MOISTURE. THIS IN TURN CAUSES APPROXIMATELY 6 INCHES OF THE TORSION BAR TO CORRODE, DEGRADING THE INTEGRITY OF THE UNIT. WITH OVER 25 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AS A MECHANIC IN THE AVIATION FIELD, I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH CORROSION AND METAL FATIQUE. THE NEW DESIGN OF THE REPLACEMENT PARTS, ELIMINATES THE SLEEVE ENTIRELY, AND THERE IS NO MOISTURE COLLECTION POINTS. CHEVROLET IS AWARE THERE IS A PROBLEM, BUT AS LONG AS THE CONSUMER IS PAYING THE BILL, WHY PUBLICLY ADMIT IT?  WITH THE REPAIR COST AND AGGRAVATION SET ASIDE, THE REAL ISSUE RELATED TO THIS FAILURE IS SAFETY. MY FAMILY HAD BEEN ON THE HIGHWAY JUST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE TORSION BAR FAILED. WHEN THE FRONT END COLLAPSES, THE STEERING CAPABILITY OF THE VEHICLE IS CLOSE TO NON EXISTANT. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE!!!  THE SAFETY ASPECT AFFECTS THE PASSENGERS IN THE VEHICLE, OTHER MOTORISTS, AND PEDESTRIANS. I ALSO NOTICED FROM THE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON THIS WEB SITE, THAT SEVERAL OF THE FAILURES OCCURRED WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED. THIS IS EVEN A SAFETY ISSUE TO ANYONE AROUND THE VEHICLE, INCLUDING CHILDREN AND MECHANICS WHO MIGHT BE NEAR OR UNDER THE VEHICLE WHEN THE FAILURES OCCUR. IN MY OPINION, CHEVROLET HAS NO INTENTION OF  INITIATING A RECALL ON THEIR OWN. UNFORTUNATELY, WITH THE NUMBER OF FAILURES OCCURING ON VEHICLES THAT ARE ONLY  A FEW YEARS OLD, THE MAJORITY OF FAILURES ARE YET TO COME. *JB",
