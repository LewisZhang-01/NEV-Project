AND, WEHN I SAY FLICKER I MEAN THEY ALMOST GO TOTALLY OUT THEN COME BACK ON. I AHVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE. HAVE RAN A COMPUTER SCAN ON IT, WHICH SHOWED NO ERROR CODES, THEY INSISTED THAT IT WAS THE A/C COMPRESSOR KICKING ON. I ADMIT IT IS POSSIBLE, BUT NOT TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS HAPPENING. WHICH, IS CONSTANTLY. AS LONG AS THE HEADLIGHTS ARE ON. THERE IS A FLICKER, I CHECKED THE BULBS, THERE IS NO COROSION AROUND THE CONNECTORS, ALL CONNECTIONS ARE TIGHT. I HAVE JOINED AN ONLINE FORUM FOR THE MODEL VEHICLE THAT I HAVE AND ALMOST ALL OF THE OTHER USERS IN THE GROUP HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING. I WOULD LIKE SOMETHING DONE ABOUT THIS AND HAVE NO IDEA WHO TO CONTACT. I HAVE A WIFE AND 2 SMALL CHILDREN, SO, NATURALLY I WANT THE VEHICLE TO BE SAFE. THE DEALER (SIMMONS-ROCKWELL IN HORNELL, N.Y.) OR WWW.SIMMONS-ROCKWELL.COM. THEY INSIST THAT IT IS THE A/C. WELL, IT HAS BEEN BELOW 40 DEGREES PRETTY MUCH EVERYDAY SINCE HALLOWEEN OF THIS YEAR. AND I HAVEN'T EVER TURNED ON THE A/C IN THE CAR NOT ONCE. ANY ASSISTANCE WITH THIS WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. AND I KNOW THERE ARE OTHERS OUT THERE LIKE ME THAT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM BUT, DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.    THANK YOU.",
