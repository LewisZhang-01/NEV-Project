PARTS AND LABOR  FOR THIS REPAIR ARE MORE THAN $2200.   THIS CAR HAS ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS ALSO.  THE WARRANTY IS GONE AFTER 24000K OR 2 YEARS.  I HAVE EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THIS CAR, BUT THEY DON'T COVER  ANYTHING FROM THE LONG LIST OF REPAIR.  I CALLED TO VW CUSTOMER CARE AND ASK TO REIMBURSE ME FOR  CLUTCH REPAIR, SINCE IT MUST BE AFTER 10 YEARS/100 000 MILES  POWER TRAIN WARRANTY. THEY REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE.  I COMPLAIN ABOUT VW QUALITY ( I HAVE FRIENDS HAVING TROUBLE  WITH VW AS WELL). I BELIEVE THAT MANUFACTURE HAS TO TAKE CARE OF BAD PRODUCT  AND COVER THE REPAIR COST. I PURCHASED THIS CAR BRAND NEW AND I EXPECT TO HAVE   A QUALITY ITEM, NOT THE JUNK FOR MORE THAN $25K.   I ALSO COMPLETELY DISSATISFIED WITH VW SERVICE!!!!",
