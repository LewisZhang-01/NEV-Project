AS A BUSINESS MAN EMPLOYING 100 EMPLOYEES, MANUFACTURING SMALL-TO-MEDIUM SIZED TRAILERS, UNDER 26000LBS GROSS VEHICLE WEIGHT, GEHMAN EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO DOT'S NHTSA NEW EARLY WARNING REPORTING REGULATIONS AS UNFAIR TO SMALL SIZED TRAILERS. UNLESS RESCINDED OR MODIFIED, EWR REGULATIONS  WOULD PUT GEHMAN AND MANY OF HIS COLLEAGUES IN THE TRAILER INDUSTRY OUT OF BUSINESS. BY NHTSA'S OWN COST  ESTIMATION GEHMAN WOULD BE FORCED TO SPENT $225000 WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS TO COMPLY WITH EWR REGULATIONS, THEN ANOTHER $145000 THIS YEAR AND ANNUALLY TO CONTINUE COMPLIANCE. GEHMAN AND MOST OF HIS COLLEAGUES DID NOT POSSESS THE NECESSARY FUNDS. IN ADDITION, GEHMAN MAINTAINS THAT EWR WAS INTENDED TO COLLECT DETAILED DATA ABOUT  VEHICLES' ACCIDENTS, WARRANTY CLAIMS, CUSTOMER COMPLIANCE, ETC. SUCH BURDEN SOME, EXPENSIVE  REPORTS WOULD NOT PROVIDE NHTSA  ANY USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT SAFETY RELATED ISSUES SINCE THIS CATEGORY OF TRAILERS, THOSE UNDER 1600 LBS AR VERY RARELY INVOLVED IN MAJOR ACCIDENTS, AND EVEN MORE RARELY HAVE ANY SAFETY RELATED DEFECTS. *AK         *JB",
