ON 04-21-2003 THEY CALLED TO TELL ME THEY WERE NOT GOING TO FIX IT DUE TO OIL SLUDGE AND THAT THE CAR HAD NOT HAD PROPER OIL CHANGES. I PROVIDED ALL OIL CHANGE RECEIPTS AND THEY ARE STILL REFUSING TO FIX THE VEHICLE. ITS STILL UNDER THE 36,000 MILE-3 YR WARRANTY. I HAVE DONE RESEARCH AND HAVE FOUND THAT THE 2.7 LITER  IN THESE CARS ARE FAULTY FOR OIL SLUDGE.  I FEEL MY CAR SHOULD BE REPAIRED.    *JB",
