AS MANUFACTURERS ARE REQUIRED TO ENSURE THE PROPER OPERATION OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT WITHIN THE VEHICLES PRODUCED OPERATE CORRECTLY FROM THE FACTORY, IT WOULD ONLY SEEM LOGICAL THAT THERE WOULD BE A PERIOD THAT WARRANTY OF SUCH SAFETY EQUIPMENT WOULD BE REQUIRED.  THERE IS A REQUIREMENT FOR RUST THRU WARRANTY ON THE BODY FOR 10-YEARS, WHY IS THERE NOT A SIMILAR REQUIREMENT TO KEEP US SAFE AND FIND RECOURSE TO CORRECT DEFICIENCIES THAT I AM REPORTING.  WHY DOES IT REQUIRE A DEATH OR SEVERAL TO FORCE NATIONAL HIGHWAY SAFETY INTO ACTION???  *TR",
