HAVE TO USE PASSENGER SIDE DOOR TO ENTER BECAUSE DRIVERS DOOR NORMALLY SETS IT OFF, AND HAVE TO UNPLUG BATTERY TO LET SYSTEM RESET, SO BATTERY DOES NOT GO DEAD WHICH NORMALLY TAKES A COUPLE OF DAYS.  LOCKS WILL LOCK AND UNLOCK ON THEIR OWN WHILE DRIVING.  DOOR AJAR WILL ALSO ACTIVATE WITH THE OTHER DOORS ON ITS OWN WHILE YOU ARE DRIVING.  THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS.  EVERYTIME I WANTED TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER, IT WOULD STOP AND THE DEALER SAID THEY COULD DO NOTHING UNLESS IT WAS HAPPENING AT THE TIME.  *AK",
