PROBLEM IS NOT MATTER WHAT KIND OF BOOSTER SEAT I PURCHASE IT DOES NOT WORK WITH THESE SEATBELTS IN MY 1991 HONDA ACCORD.  THE LAW STATES I MUST PUT MY 5 YEAR OLD IN A BOOSTER SEAT, AND FOR HIS SAFETY I WANT HIM IN ONE, BUT IT IS UNSAFE FOR HIM TO BE IN ONE BECAUSE THE SEAT BELTS NEVER LOCK.  I CAN PULL ON THEM AND THEY DON'T IMMEDIATELY LOCK. THIS IS SERIOUSLY UNSAFE!  I EMERGENCY RETRACTABLE SEATBELTS ARE NOT SAFE. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS MATTER.  MY FIVE YEAR OLD STILL USES HIS CARSEAT SINCE I CAN'T USE A BOOSTER SEAT IN MY CAR.  (HE IS TOO BIG FOR THE CARSEAT NOW, SO WHAT DO I DO RISK HIS LIFE BECAUSE OF THESE FAULTY SEATBELTS.  NO, HONDA NEEDS TO REPLACE THESE SEAT BELTS WITH LOCKING SEATBELTS SO MY CHILD CAN BE SAFE!!    *NLM",
