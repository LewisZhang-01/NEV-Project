I HAVE DRIVEN MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS FOR OVER 35 YEARS AND I KNOW IT IS NOT MY DRIVING/SHIFTING SKILLS. A CHECK OF A MESSAGE BOARD SHOWS THAT OTHER SUBARU OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE DEALERSHIP WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE A PROBLEM OUTSIDE OF DRIVER ERROR.  THIS COULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE AND/OR DESIGN DEFECT.  MY CAR IS NOW OUT OF WARRANTY AND I HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE WITH THIS. BUT IF THIS IS AN ACTUAL DEFECT THAT SHOULD BE REPAIRED BY THE MANUFACTURER, I WANT IT KNOWN THAT I HAVE THE PROBLEM.  THERE IS ALSO THE ISSUE OF BAD O2 SENSORS ON THIS CAR.  MINE WAS REPLACED 3 TIMES BEFORE A RECALL WAS DONE.  THAT WAS 32,000 MILES AGO AND NOW THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT HAS COME BACK ON ONLY AFTER A 60,000 MILE SERVICE.  THE DEALERSHIP IS ASKING ME TO DO MORE REPAIRS AS A PROCESS OF ELIMINATION TO ZERO IN ON THE CAUSE OF THE LIGHT SHOWING.  I FEEL THEY DID SOMETHING DURING THE MAINTENANCE SERVICE AND WANT ME TO PAY FOR THEIR ERRORS.  IF IT IS ANOTHER O2 SENSOR THAT HAS GONE BAD, DOESN'T THE STATE OF CA HAVE A 50,000 WARRANTY ON ALL EMISSION COMPONENTS?  WOULD IT BE COVERED?",
