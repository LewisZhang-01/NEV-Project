SINCE THE WARRANTY EXPIRED THE SMELL HAS BECOME STRONGER.  I HAD IT CHECKED, AND THE FORD SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAID IT WOULD COST $600 TO REPAIR.  THE OTHER IS A SHIMMY AT 40 MILES PER HOUR.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT JUST ROTATED AND BALANCED MY TIRES.  I HAD THIS DONE A MONTH EARLIER AND IT DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  THE VEHICLE STILL SHIMMIES BADLY AT 40 MPH.   *NLM",
