        "summary": "MY WIFE WAS DRIVING THIS CAR ON THE NJ GARDEN STATE PARKWAY AT 65 MPH IN THE EXPRESS LANES WHEN THE VEHICLE STARTED RUNNING BAD AND LOST POWER. THIS WAS A DANGEROUS CONDITION TO LOSE POWER AT THAT SPEED. SHE PULLED THE CAR OVER TO SIDE, SHUT OFF ENGINE, THEN RESTARTED AND WAS ABLE TO MOVE VEHICLE ABOUT A MILE AND GET OFF THE PARKWAY AT EXIT 117 TO ROUTE 35 SOUTH. THE CAR AGAIN STARTED TO RUN BAD AND SHE PULLED INTO A FORD DEALERSHIP NEAR THIS EXIT. THE FORD DEALER HAD TO REPLACE THE THROTTLE BODY WHICH WENT BAD. THIS TOOK 5 DAYS AS THERE IS A NATIONAL SHORTAGE FOR THIS PART.#DS7Z9E926D. IT IS EVIDENT THAT FORD HAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THIS PART BREAKING DOWN ON THOUSANDS OF CARS AS I SEE OTHER CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET. I CONTACTED FORD CORP. IN DETROIT AND WAS TOLD NOT UNDER WARRANTY ON MY CAR. THIS NEEDS TO BE A RECALL. I WORRY THAT THIS PART IS DEFECTIVE, WON'T LAST LONG AND WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. I WORRY ABOUT ANOTHER BREAKDOWN AT HIGH SPEED--VERY DANGEROUS CONDITION.   *TR",
