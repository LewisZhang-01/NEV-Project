STOP LIGHTS SHOULD BE MANDATORY ON THE FRONT OF CARS AND TRUCKS AS WELL AS THE PRESENT LOCATIONS IN THE REAR.  THE BENEFIT IS A DRIVER CAN TELL IF THE CAR APPROACHING A STOP SIGN OR LIGHT IS REALLY INTENDING TO STOP.  THE SAME IS TRUE OF A DRIVER WITH TURN SIGNALS ON BUT HAS NO INTENTION TO SLOW AND TURN.  THAT WOULD BE APPARENT IF THERE WAS A STOP LIGHT IN THE FRONT AND MAY SAVE A PERSON FROM PULLING IN FRONT OF THE CAR THEY BELIEVED WAS GOING TO TURN.    ON THE REAR OF A CAR THERE SHOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THE CURRENT LIGHTS, A YELLOW CAUTION LIGHT THAT COMES ON WHEN THE CAR IS COASTING (NEITHER GAS NOR BRAKES APPLIED).  THIS WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL WARNING TO THE FOLLOWING DRIVER THAT CHANGES ARE TAKING PLACE UP AHEAD.",
