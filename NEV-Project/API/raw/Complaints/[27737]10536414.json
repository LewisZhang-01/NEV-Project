WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AT 45 TO 50 MPH THE CAR SUDDENLY DOWNSHIFTS CAUSING THE MOTOR TO ACCELERATE WHILE THE VEHICLE SLOWS  DOWN AND  WHEN THE ACCELERATOR IS COMPLETELY RELEASED   THE SPEED IS QUICKLY REDUCED LIKE THE BRAKE IS BEING APPLIED...TO MAINTAIN A SPEED OF 25 TO 30 MPH THE MOTOR RPM HAS TO BE IN THE 3500 RANGE. THIS CONDITION REMAINS UNTIL THE VEHICLE IS STOPPED AND THEN IT RETURNS BACK TO NORMAL OPERATIONS.   THIS VEHICLE WAS RETURNED TO THE DEALER FOR CORRECTION BUT THEY SPENT TWO DAYS AND NEVER DID FIND THE PROBLEM. THAT'S WHY I'M SENDING THIS TO YOU.       *TR",
