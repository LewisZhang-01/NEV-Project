THE MAIN PROBLEM NOW IS THE BACK COVERS OF THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER FRONT SEAT KEEP COMING OUT OF PLACE. IT HAS OCCURRED 3 TIMES IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN FOR ME IF THE CAR IS IN AN ACCIDENT, THE BACK COVER WOULD LOOSE AND DETACH FROM THE SEAT DURING IMPACT AND CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY TO MY 20 MONTHS CHILD. THE BMW DEALERS REFUSED TO REPAIR THE ISSUE AND CLAIMING THAT THEY ARE ONLY COSMETIC PROBLEMS. BUT THE VEHICLE SHOULD BE RETESTED BY NHTSA FOR THE SEAT ISSUES AND RECALL THE VEHICLES FOR SUCH PROBLEM DUE TO CHILDRENS' SAFETY CONCERNS. *TR",
