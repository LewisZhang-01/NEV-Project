IT STILL SMELLS LIKE MOLD. IT IS NOT THE HEATER OR AC AS THE SMELL IS COMING FROM THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE. THERE IS NO DAMPNESS BUT EVERYTHING I PUT IN THE BACK SEAT ENDS UP SMELLING LIKE MOLD. I CALL IT THE MOLD MOBILE. AFTER ABOUT 2 MINUTES, YOU CAN'T SMELL THE MOLD, SO IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO TRACK. THE DEALERSHIP IN WALDORF SAID IT WOULD TAKE DAYS TO LOCATE IT, BUT THEY COULD SMELL IT TOO. IT IS UNDER WARRANTY AND THERE MUST BE SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THIS. IT MAKES ME SICK TO MY STOMACH AND I GET HEADACHES.   *NLM",
