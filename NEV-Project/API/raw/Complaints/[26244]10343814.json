AT TIMES IT'S HARD TO MAINTAIN THE CAR IN THE LANE THAT I'M DRIVING IN ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE SLIGHT CURVES ON THE ROAD AND IT GETS WORST WHEN TAKING BIG CURVES. I HAVE TO SLOW DOWN TO AVOID DRIVING IN BETWEEN LANES WHEN CARS ARE ON MY LEFT AND RIGHT THEREFORE I AM NOT ABLE TO CONTROL THE CAR DUE TO THE ERRATIC STEERING AND WHICH MIGHT CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. THE STEERING AT TIMES LOCKS OR STAYS IN ONE SPOT AND IT'S HARD TO STRAIGHTEN IT WITHOUT FORCING IT BACK TO THE CENTER.  ONE DEALER TOLD ME THAT IT WAS NORMAL, I'VE DRIVEN MANY CARS IN MY LIFE AND NEVER FELT SO UNSAFE DRIVING A CAR LIKE I DO WITH THIS ONE. *TR",
