I TOOK IT IN TO THE DEALER AND THEY REPAIRED IT AND WITHIN A FEW DAYS IT WAS HARD TO OPEN AGAIN. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER AND THEY FIXED IT AGAIN. AGAIN IT BECAME HARD TO OPEN I JUST TOOK IT TO A DIFFERENT DEALER AND THEY TRIED TO FIX IT AGAIN WITH NO LUCK. I FEEL THAT THIS IS NOT SAFE IN CASE OF A WRECK THAT I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OPEN IT TO GET MY 9 YEAR OLD SON OUT IF I HAD TO IN A HURRY.  *NLM",
