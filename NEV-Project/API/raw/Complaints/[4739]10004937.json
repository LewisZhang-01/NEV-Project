YESTERDAY WHILE DRIVING ON A SMOOTH INTERSTATE MY OTHER FRONT TIRE SAME BRAND HAD THE ENTIRE TREAD SEPARATE.  THE TIRE REMAINED INFLATED AS I PULLED OFF THE ROAD.  MY TWO REAR TIRES ARE THE SAME MODEL AND I AM CONSERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THESE TIRES.  I HAD CHECKED THE PRESSURE IN ALL 4 TIRES LESS THAN A WEEK AGO AND THEY WERE TO MANUFATOROR SPECS.",
