IT DOES NOT PHYSICALLY DETACH FROM THE STEERING COLUMN, BUT IT ROCKS FREELY BACK AND FORTH. ATTEMPTING TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL AFTER THIS CAUSES A GRINDING SOUND AND IS UNSTABLE DUE TO THE ROCKING MOTION. THE FAILURE OCCURRED ON MARCH 6, AND A CHRYSLER DEALER SERVICED THE CAR ON MARCH 7 USING TSB  19-008-01 AS A SERVICE PROCEDURE. THE EXACT SAME FAILURE OCCURRED THE NEXT DAY, AFTER SERVICING. A DIFFERENT CHRYSLER DEALER SERVICED IT USING TSB  19-008-01 WHICH INVOLVES INSERTING A SHIM.  TWO DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS RECOMMENDED REPLACING THE STEERING COLUMN AND CHRYSLER WOULD NOT AUTHORIZE IT.*JB",
