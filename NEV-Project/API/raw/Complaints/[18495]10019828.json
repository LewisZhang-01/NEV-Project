FOLLOWING A PUNCTURE AND SUBSEQUENT REPLACEMENT OF 4 TIRES ON MY VEHICLE DUE TO NORMAL WEAR, ALL 20 NUTS ALSO HAD TO BE REPLACED AS THEY COULD ONLY BE REMOVED BY FORCE.   DEALER INFORMED ME THAT TSB EXISTS FOR THIS ISSUE, BUT NO FORMAL RECALL.  NOTE: 1 SAMPLE OF DEFECTIVE NUT AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST.   *JB",
