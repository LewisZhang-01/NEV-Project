THE CAR WOULD LURCH SEVERELY AND HESITATE, THE ENGINE REVVED VERY LOUDLY, AND THE SPEED REDUCED TO 40 MPH, EVEN THOUGH I HAD MY FOOT TO THE FLOOR ON THE GAS PEDAL.  AFTER DRIVING OFF THE HIGHWAY, IT WOULD DO THE SAME THING AT CITY SPEEDS AND HAD LITTLE TO NO ACCELERATION.  DEALER SAID THE CODES SHOWED IT WAS THE FUEL PUMP AND IT WOULD DO THE BUCKING AND LACK OF ACCELERATION AFTER THE PUMP HEATED UP.  DEALER SAID THE CAR WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE.  THE FUEL PUMP, FUEL FILTER HAD TO BE REPLACED, AND THE INJECTORS FLUSHED.  *TR",
