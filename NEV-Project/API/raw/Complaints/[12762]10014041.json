TOYOTA OF EASILY CLAIMS THAT AS A TSB ONLY, THEY ARE NOT REQUIRED TO DO OUT-OF-WARRANTY REPAIRS.  I NOTICED THE PROBLEMS WITHIN WARRANTY BUT DID NOT MAKE A REPORT TO MY DEALER.  I ASKED IF THEY WOULD SELL ME THE PARTS AT COST.  NO.  I EMAILED TOYOTA NATIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ASKED THE SAME QUESTION.  NO RESPONSE.  I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A SAFETY DEFECT THAT SHOULD BE A RECALL NOT A TSB.  IF THERE WAS NOT AN ENGINEERING FLAW, WHY DO THEY HAVE NEW CALIPERS AND BACKING PLATES FOR THE TSB?   THEY SHOULD AT LEAST PROVIDE THESE PARTS AT COST TO OUT-OF-WARRANTY CONSUMERS, RATHER THAN AT THEIR INFLATED LIST PRICE OF NEARLY $1,000 (PARTS ONLY). *JB",
