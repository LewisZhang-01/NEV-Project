THE MECHANIC (CRAVEN AUTO AND TIRE OF GAITHERSBURG, MD) REPAIRED THE WHEEL AND TOLD ME THAT AT LEAST ONE OTHER PERSON HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH A 1999 WINDSTAR.  THE FIRST SYMPTOM NOTICED WAS A RATTLING NOISE AROUND THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE AREA. THEN ON SATURDAY 6/7/2003 WE PULLED INTO OUR DRIVE AND HEARD A VERY LOUD \"CLUNK\". I QUICKLY REALIZED THE VAN WAS UNDRIVEABLE AND HAD A TOW TRUCK TAKE THE VAN TO OUR MECHANIC.*AK",
