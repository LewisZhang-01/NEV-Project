VW KNOWS THERE ARE DEFECTIVE COILS AND REFUSES TO REPLACE ANY BUT THE ONE THAT BLEW, LEAVING DRIVERS STRANDED WITHOUT THE USE OF THEIR CARS.  I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RENT A CAR THROUGH THEIR RENTAL SERVICE EITHER, SINCE IN BOTH CASES, THE COILS BLEW AFTER THE RENTAL AGENT DESK WAS CLOSED FOR THE WEEKEND.  A SEARCH ON HTTP://WWW.CARREVIEW.COM/PRD_299_1531CRX.ASPX REVEALED THE IGNITION COIL FAILURE IS A COMMON PROBLEM, THAT VW KNOWS ABOUT AND THEY REFUSE TO RECALL TO FIX THEIR DEFECTIVE MERCHANIDISE.  BOTH TIMES, THE DEALER AND MANUFACTURER DENIED MY REQUEST TO REPLACE ALL OF THE COILS UNDER WARRANTY.",
