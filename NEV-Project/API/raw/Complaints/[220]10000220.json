THIS GAPING HOLE IS LEFT COVERED ONLY BY A FLAP OF FABRIC. MY FEAR IS THAT IN A REAR END COLLISION THERE IS NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH SUPPORT FOR THE CHILD'S BACK. I CALLED THE EVENFLO HOTLINE, AND THEY TOLD ME THIS DESIGN WAS TESTED AND SAFE, BUT IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK, SO I WILL BE RETURNING THESE PROMPTLY.",
