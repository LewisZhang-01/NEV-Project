WITH DSG TRANSMISSION IN 'D\" MODE, COASTING AT MODERATE SPEED IN TRAFFIC, TRANSMISSION SLIPPED OUT OF GEAR INTO FALSE NEUTRAL, TRANSMISSION DISPLAY FLASHING \"PRNDS\".  STEPPING ON ACCELERATOR CAUSED ENGINE TO REV TO REDLINE, CAR DID NOT SPEED UP. THIS HAPPENED ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS, EACH TIME I TRIED REPEATEDLY PLACING TRANSMISSION INTO \"TIPTRONIC\" MODE AND BACK INTO \"D\", PROBLEM RESOLVED WITHIN 30 SECONDS AND TRANSMISSION THEN FUNCTIONED NORMALLY.  CEL DID NOT ILLUMINATE.  AS THIS HAPPENED IN LIGHT TRAFFIC, THE FAILURE ONLY DELAYED VEHICLES BEHIND ME TEMPORARILY.  I HAVE NOT TAKEN IT TO VW DEALER YET AS THEY HAVE NO INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  TDI CLUB FORUM POSTS SUGGEST PROBLEM IS FAULTY TRANSMISSION TEMP SENSOR, MAY BE MORE COMMON IN VEHICLES SOLD IN SPRING 2009. *TR",
