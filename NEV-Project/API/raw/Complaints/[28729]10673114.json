        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING 25-40 MPH, THE CAR WENT INTO LIMP MODE, NO ACCELERATION AT ALL. \"YELLOW WRENCH\" LIGHT CAME ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. I WAS STUCK IN THE INTERSECTION, MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN ACROSS TWO LANES OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC, AND I COULD NOT MOVE THE CAR. THE ENGINE DID NOT TURN OFF OR STALL. I JUST HAD NO POWER OR ABILITY TO ACCELERATE.  I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO ROLL INTO A SAFE SPOT, OUT OF TRAFFIC AND HARMS WAY. I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND WAITED A FEW MINUTES TO RESTART. WHEN I RESTARTED IT, THE WRENCH LIGHT WAS OFF AND THE CAR RAN FINE. THIS HAPPENED TWICE, TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW, SO I HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALER THE NEXT DAY. THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO FIND ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR AND WANTED ME TO JUST TAKE IT AS IS.  I MENTIONED THAT I HAD READ ABOUT ISSUES WITH THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE BODY, AND THEY SAID IT SEEMED FINE.  HOW CAN THEY ALLOW ME TO TAKE A CAR THAT IS SO UNSAFE TO DRIVE? I COULD HAVE BEEN HIT, AND THE PERSON THAT HIT ME COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. I CALLED FORD CUSTOMER RELATIONS, REGARDING AN INVESTIGATION ON THIS PROBLEM, AND THEY WERE REQUIRED TO DO A \"CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM;. BUT MY VIN DID NOT FALL INTO THIS PROGRAM.  I PAID TO HAVE THE ETB REPLACED, OUT OF POCKET, AND AM HOPING THAT THIS IS THE PROBLEM.  VERY UNSAFE SITUATION TO BE PUT IN BY FORD.  *TR",
