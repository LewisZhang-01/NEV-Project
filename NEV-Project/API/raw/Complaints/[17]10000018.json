IN JUNE 2002 MY CRUISE CONTROL WENT OUT, AFTER BRINGING IT IN TO THE DEALER AGAIN I WAS TOLD IN WAS THE CLOCKSPRING, AGAIN I DECLINED REPAIR AS IT WASN'T COVERED. IN SEPT2002 MY HORN WENT AGAIN I WAS TIOLD THAT IT WAS THE CLOCKSPRING. STILL NOT COVERED BUT NOW I HAVE TO GET IT FIXED. THE PART WAS BACK ODERED DURING THIS TIME A SAFTEY RECALL WAS ISSUSED AND CHRYSLER SAID THAT THEY WOULD PAY FOR REPAIRS.
