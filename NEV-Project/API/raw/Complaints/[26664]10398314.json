IN 2005, WITH ONLY 89000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE I STARTED IT UP ONE AFTERNOON WHEN I WAS ON MY WAY HOME FROM WORK AND IT WAS RUNNING ROUGH.  I DROVE IT HOME AND PARKED IT AND WENT OUT APPROXIMATELY AN HOUR LATER AND STARTED IT UP AND IT HAD A VERY LOUD ROD KNOCK.  I WAS JUST RESEARCHING REBUILD KITS AND REBUILT ENGINES WHEN I CAME ACROSS ALL THE POSTS ABOUT HYDROLOCK.  I NOW KNOW THAT THIS WAS A SITUATION THAT FORD WAS AWARE OF, BUT DID NOTHING TO CORRECT AND LEFT PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF WITH A VEHICLE THAT WAS WELL MAINTAINED AND DID NOT LAST.  UNFORTUNATELY, I DID NOT HAVE THE MEANS TO REPAIR AND THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN SITTING ALL THIS TIME.  I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE TAKEN RESPONSIBILITY WHEN THEY FOUND OUT AND PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF WOULD HAVE HAD PROTECTION ON OUR INVESTMENT.  *TR",
