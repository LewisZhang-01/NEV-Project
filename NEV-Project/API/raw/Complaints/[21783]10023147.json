I DRAINED DEX-COOL AND USED SYSTEM CLEANER TWICE FOR APPROXIMATELY 6 HOURS EACH TIME WITH HEATER ON.  I FILLED SYSTEM WITH REGULAR PRESTONE GLYCOL BASED ANTIFREEZE.  NO PROBLEMS TO DATE.  THE ORIGINAL DEX-COOL WAS A MUDDY SLUDGE WHEN REPLACED AND THE SECOND CHARGE OF DEX-COOL WAS ALREADY CHANGING COLORS AND THICKENING AFTER ONLY 4 MONTHS WHEN IT TOO WAS REPLACED.  DEX-COOL DOES NOT LIVE UP TO THE MANUFACTURERS CLAIMS OR THE DEALERS REPRESENTATIONS.  I AM A FEDERALLY LICENSED AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE TECHNICIAN WORKING FOR A MAJOR AIRLINE FOR 14 YEARS  AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO GIVE A DEPOSITION IN REGARDS TO THIS MATTER.  *NLM",
