BUT THEY ARE OUT OF PARTS AND DON'T KNOW WHEN IT CAN BE FIXED.  IN A FRONT OR PASSENGER SIDE IMPACT, THE PASSENGER AIR BAG COULD STILL INFLATE, WITHOUT A PASSENGER, THUS PLACING THE DRIVER AT RISK. SO WHAT DO I DO?  STOP DRIVING THE CAR UNTIL SUBARU FIXES THE PROBLEM? WHAT CAN NHTSA DO TO MAKE SUBARU FIX THE PROBLEM ASAP?",
