        "summary": "I WAS CHANGING MY FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE TIRE IN MY DRIVEWAY USING THE JACK SUPPLIED WITH MY 1998 PLYMOUTH VOYAGER.  I HAD JUST REMOVED THE TIRE WHEN THE \"JACK SCREW\" SNAPPED IN HALF.  THE VAN FELL TOWARDS ME, HITTING ME AND KNOCKING ME BACKWARDS ONTO THE PAVEMENT.  THE FORCE OF THE IMPACT CAUSED ME TO BREAK A MOLAR IN HALF REQUIRING A CAP TO REPAIR IT.  SINCE THEN I HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED OCCASIONAL BLURRED VISION.    I CONTACTED DAIMLER CHRYSLER CORP. VIA THEIR INTERNET SITE ON 02/10/03.  I DID NOT EVER SPEAK TO A CSR UNTIL 02/18/03.  I WAS TOLD THAT CHRYSLER HAD REVIEWED MY COMPLAINT AND DETERMINED THAT THE INJURIES WERE NOT A DIRECT RESULT OF THE DEFECTIVE JACK AND REFUSED TO ASSIST ME WITH MY DENTAL BILLS.  FURTHER MORE THEY SAID MY CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, SO THEY COULD NOT EVEN REPLACE MY JACK.  I AM AN ENGINEER BY PROFESSION AND THOUGHT THEY MIGHT WANT TO ANALYZE THE FAILURE, BUT I WAS TOLD THAT SINCE THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING BEFORE, THEY DID NOT FEEL THAT IT WAS A MAJOR ISSUE.    I WAS LUCKY THAT MY INJURIES ONLY INVOLVED A TOOTH AND BLURRED VISION.  THE NEXT TIME SOMEBODY MIGHT BE CRUSHED.",
