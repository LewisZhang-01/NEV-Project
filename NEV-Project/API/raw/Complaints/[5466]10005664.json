THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR A $35,000 CAR THAT HAS LESS THAN 3000 MILES ON THE CLOCK, IT DOES NOT MAKE YOU FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE TO KNOW THAT IT COULD HAPPEN AT LEAST ANOTHER 5 TIMES. THE DEALER WAS VERY EFFICIENT AND COURTEOUS, BUT THAT DOES NOT CUT IT WITH SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM THAT COULD STRIKE AT ANY TIME. WITH SO MANY CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS, AUDI SHOULD BE FORCED TO ISSUE A RECALL NOTICE.",
