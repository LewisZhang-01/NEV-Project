THIS USUALLY HAPPENS WHEN I AM SLOWING DOWN FOR A STOP SIGN OR RED LIGHT.  IT ALSO HAS TWICE STOPPED WHEN I AM GOING SLOW ON A LARGE LOOPING ENTRANCE RAMP TO THE INTERSTATE.  EACH TIME THE CAR WILL START RIGHT UP AGAIN AND RUN FINE.  THERE IS NO PRIOR WARNING THE CAR IS GOING TO DIE.  I FIRST NOTICED IT DIED WHEN I WA NO LONGER ABLE TO STEER THE CAR, BECAUSE THE POWER STEERING IS GONE.    IN FEBRUARY 2003 I  TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM TO HAVE THE PROBLEM CHECKED OUT.  I WAS CHARGED $36.25 FOR A DIAGNOSTIC ON THE VEHICLE AND WAS TOLD THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.  I ASKED WHAT I SHOULD DO SINCE THE CAR KEEPS STALLING AND I BELIEVE IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO DRIVE. I WAS TOLD TO TRADE IT IN.  *JB",
