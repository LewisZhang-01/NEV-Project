        "summary": "WHEN THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE FALLS MUCH (MORE THAN ~5 DEGREES F) BELOW FREEZING, THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS FAIL TO OPERATE PROPERLY.  IT APPEARS THAT THEY TEND TO KEEP A CURVED SHAPE FROM RESETTING AGAINST THE BOTTOM OF THE WINDSHIELD WHEN NOT IN USE AND DO NOT CLEAR THE AREA DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER CAUSING POOR VISIBILITY.  THIS EFFECT WORSENS AS THE TEMPERATURE FALLS.  A NEW SET OF WIPER BLADES (WINTER BLADES, MADE FOR LOW TEMPERATURE)  FAILED TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM.  THE MOST SEVERE HAPPENED ON MARCH 4, 2003 THE PRECEDING CAR SPRAYED A SALT/WATER MIXTURE ON THE WINDSHIELD THAT HAD TO BE REMOVED BY HAND AFTER STOPPING ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD DUE TO ZERO VISIBILITY.  *JB",
