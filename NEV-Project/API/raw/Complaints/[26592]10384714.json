THE ONLY WAY TO ALLEVIATE THIS STRESS IS TO RECLINE THE SEAT TO THE POINT WHERE YOUR HEAD DOESN'T CONTACT THE HEADREST.  THIS PUTS STRESS ON YOUR NECK MUSCLES CAUSING STIFFNESS AND HEADACHES.  THIS IS A DEFECTIVE DESIGN THAT MUST BE CORRECTED.  WHEN I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN FOR SERVICING AT 4000 MILES I INFORMED THE SERVICE MANAGER WHO TOLD ME HE GETS LOTS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE HEAD RESTRAINT AND THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO ABOUT IT.  PERHAPS FORD CAN PROACTIVELY CITE A REPLACEMENT HEADREST FROM ONE OF ITS OTHER MODELS.  I AM NOW TAKING MUSCLE RELAXANTS EVERY NIGHT TO RELIEVE THE STRESS ON MY NECK.  *TR",
