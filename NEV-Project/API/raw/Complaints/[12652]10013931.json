NOW TOYOTA SAYS THE LEAKS AROUND THE VALVES ARE DUE TO MY \"NEGLECT\" IN CHANGING OIL. I HAVE THE RECEIPT FROM 4 MOS AGO FOR OIL CHANGE. I ALSO WAS TOLD THEY WOULD NOT CONSIDER PAYING FOR IT BECAUSE IT WAS MY LACK OF OIL CHANGE THAT \"CAUSED\" THE SLUDGING (DESPITE MY RECEIPT) AND THAT I NEEDED ALL MY OIL CHANGE RECEIPTS FOR THEM TO CONSIDER A CLAIM (2 1/2 YEAR OLD CAR.)",
