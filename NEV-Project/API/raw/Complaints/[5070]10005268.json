NEARLY CAUSED ME TO CRASH ON ONE OCCASION, AFTER HITTING THE BREAKS AND THE PRESSURE OF MY BODY MADE THE SEAT RECLINE.  AFTER CONTACTING SATURN, THEY TOLD ME THE RECLINING MECHANISM WAS NOT RECALLED ON THE EARLIER MODELS (BEFORE 1994 OR 1995, I CAN'T REMEMBER).  I FEEL THIS IS A PROBLEM, AS THE CARS AREN'T THAT OLD WHEN THE MECHAISM FAILS.  I HAVE REPLACED THE PASSENGER SEAT ALREADY IN 1999 , WITH THE DRIVERS SEAT UNREPAIRED AT THIS TIME.  IT CAUSES A SERIOUS PROBLEM WHEN DRIVING, AND SATURN KNOWS THERE IS A PROBLEM.",
