I GOT OUT AND SAW FLAMES SHOOTING FROM UNDER THE BUMPER. WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ON THE WAY, WE MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO PUT THE FIRE OUT W/WATER TO NO AVAIL. A NEARBY STORE OWNER CAME OUT WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER AND WAS ABLE TO PUT THE FIRE OUT. ONCE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED, HE INDICATED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE AN ELECTRICAL FIRE. ONCE THEY MOVED THE CAR, MY HUSBAND ATTEMPTED TO START IT AND IT STARTED BILLOWING OUT SMOKE. AT THAT POINT, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ORDERED HIM TO TURN IT OFF AND HAVE THE CAR TOWED AND TO NOT DRIVE THE VEHICLE AGAIN",
