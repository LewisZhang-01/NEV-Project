I HAVE ONLY HAD THIS CAR FOR SEVEN MONTHS AND THE GAS PEDAL WAS STICKING AND TAKING OFF VERY FAST AND SHIFTING ITS GEARS. THE MOTOR WAS RUMBLING AND SHAKING. I HAD TO REPAIR THE AXLES OF THE CAR. I HAD TO TAKE IT BACK EVERY MONTH BECAUSE OF THE ENGINE. THE WATER PUMP OVER HEATED AND THE GAS PEDAL IS STILL STICKING AND TAKING OFF VERY FAST TODAY. ALSO THE DEALER IS TRYING TO TAKE AWAY THE WARRANTY SO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS. I ASKED THE DEALER TO TAKE A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION BUT THEY REFUSED. I ASKED FOR AN EVEN EXCHANGE FOR A DIFFERENT CAR BUT THEY WANTED ME TO PAY FOR THIS CAR AND THE OTHER IF I GOT ONE. URGENTLY RESPOND TO MY COMPLAINT. *JB",
