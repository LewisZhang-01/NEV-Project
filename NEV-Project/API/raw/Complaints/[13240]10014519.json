        "summary": "THE PASSENGER SIDE POWER SLIDING DOOR ON MY 2000 CHEVY VENTURE DOES NOT CLOSE PROPERLY.   THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE I BOUGHT THE VAN NEW.  I HAVE TAKEN IT TO CHEVY DEALERS ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, BUT WAS TOLD THERE WAS NO PROBLEM.  AT ONE TIME LAST YEAR, THE DOOR OPENED WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD.  MY 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS IN THE SEAT BY THE DOOR AND THANKFULLY DID NOT FALL OUT.  WE TOOK IT IMMEDIATELY TO THE DEALER, BUT THEY AGAIN SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG.  THE PROBLEM IS NOT PREDICTABLE, WHICH MAKES IT HARD TO SHOW THE DEALER, BUT THE DOOR WILL MAKE A GROANING SOUND AND THE ALARM WILL SOUND WHEN IT DOES.  THE REAR PART OF THE DOOR APPEARS TO TRY TO PULL IN TOO FAR, CAUSING THE SOUND.  THE DOOR WILL THEN HAVE TO BE OPENED AND SHUT 3-4 TIMES TO GET IT TO PROPERLY CLOSE.  I STOPPED TAKING IT TO THE DEALER AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRED BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO BE CHARGED TO HEAR THEM SAY NOTHING IS WRONG.  THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM.  I TOOK IT IN FOR THE RECALL, BUT THEY AGAIN SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG.  I HAVE CONTACTED CHEVROLET, BUT THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING SINCE IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  THE VAN HAS 48,000 MILES AND THE DOOR HAS BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE DAY ONE.  MAYBE IF ENOUGH PEOPLE NOTIFY YOUR ORGANIZATION, SOMETHING WILL BE DONE.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE WITH THIS MATTER.  THE INCIDENT DATE LISTED BELOW IS THE APPROXIMATE TIME I PURCHASED THE VAN, SINCE THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM.   *JB",
