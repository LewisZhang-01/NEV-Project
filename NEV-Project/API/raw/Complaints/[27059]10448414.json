SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASING THE JEEP THE DRIVER'S SEAT BRACKETS GOT WORSE, SHIFTING WHEN I GOT IN AND RECENTLY BROKE THROUGH.  AFTER THE BRACKET BROKE, THE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT BEGAN GOING OFF WHEN I GO AROUND A CORNER OR CURVE AND THE SEAT SHIFTS.  BEGAN RESEARCHING AND FOUND THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH MANY THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS. I'VE LEFT INSTRUCTIONS WITH MY FAMILY TO SUE JEEP IF I DIE OR GET SERIOUSLY INJURED IN AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE I CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY A DIFFERENT CAR AND CAN'T SELL THIS JEEP WITH A BROKEN FRONT SEAT.  *TR",
