        "summary": "\"TAKADA RECALL\" WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AT 40 MPH. I HEARD A CHIME AND LOOKED DOWN AT MY INSTRUMENT PANEL. THE ABS AND THE ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL WAS ON. LIGHT WAS ON FOR BOTH. BUT INSTEAD OF THE ESC IT WAS THE LITTLE CAR WITH WAVY,JIGGLY LINES UNDER IT. THESE TWO LIGHTS HAVE BEEN ON CONSTANT FOR A GOOD 3 WEEKS. IT HAS GONE OUT WHILE DRIVING A FEW TIMES FOR A FEW MINUTES JUST TO COME BACK ON AND STAY ON ALMOST ALL THE TIME. THERE IS NO FLASHING OF THE LIGHTS. I DON'T DRIVE EVERY DAY. I DRIVE AROUND 5 TIMES A WEEK AND SHORT DISTANCES OF 2 TO 4 MILES FOR THE MOST PART. THERE IS ALSO A WHISTLING NICE COMING FROM THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE. I DON'T THINK IT IS VERY SAFE TO DRIVE SINCE THE BRAKES AND TRACTION OF THE CAR ARE ALL TO IMPORTANT PART OF ME AND MY FAMILIES SAFETY. PLEASE HELP WITH THIS ISSUE. I PAID AND AM STILL PAYING A LOT FOR THIS CAR THAT NOW HAS 62000. MILES ON IT.  *TR",
