WHEN TOWED AND REPAIRED AT THE MERCURY GARAGE, THE ONLY CAUSE WAS A DEFECTIVE #8 CYLINDER COIL/PLUG ASSEMBLY.  I BELIEVE THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS CONDITION.  I FOUND OUT LATER THAT FORD HAS A SERVICE BULLETIN OUT FOR COIL/PLUG FAILURES.  A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE THIS THE #7 COIL/PLUG ASSEMBLY SHORTED OUT BUT IT DID NOT CAUSE THE CAR TO SHUT DOWN.  I BELIEVE FORD SHOULD RECALL 2000 MERCURYS AND REPLACE ALL 8 OF THE COIL/PLUG ASSEMBLIES.      I BOUGHT THE CAR NEW.  IT WAS MY 3RD  GRAND MARQUIS AND MY LAST.  I TRADED THE CAR AS A RESULT OF THE #8 COIL/PLUG FAILURE .  YOU MAY GIVE FORD THIS INFORMATION.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
