LUCKILY WE CAUGHT IT IMMEDIATELY AND THE DEALER IS REPLACING IT UNDER WARRANTY.  HAS THIS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH THE XTERRA AND SHOULD THE OTHER ONE BE REPLACED AT THE SAME TIME?  THE DEALER CLAIMS TO HAVE LOOKED AT THE OTHER ONE AND SEES NO PROBLEM AT THIS TIME.  I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY BECAUSE I DO A LOT OF HIGH SPEED DRIVING WITH MY DAUGHTER IN THE CAR.   *NLM",
