I HAD FIRST NOTICED THE COOLANT LEVEL DROPPING BACK IN DECEMBER, 2017 WHILE MY CAR WAS IN STORAGE. IT WAS BROUGHT INTO FIELDS DODGE WHO DIAGNOSED THE LEAK BUT COULD NOT TELL ME WHERE EXACTLY THE LEAK WAS COMING FROM.  I CALLED DODGE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY REFUSED TO OFFER ANYTHING ON RESOLVING THIS ISSUE EVEN THOUGH MY WARRANTY EXPIRED 3 DAYS AGO ON MARCH 12TH, 2018. THEY DO HAVE A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN REGARDING RADIATOR LEAK PROBLEMS BUT THEY ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT, EVEN FOR CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE LOW MILEAGE BUT EXPIRED WARRANTY. THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE MANAGER MENTIONED THE LEAK MAY BE COMING FROM A SEAM BETWEEN THE PLASTIC AND ALUMINUM.  THE RADIATOR IS OF INFERIOR QUALITY AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHERS ON CHALLENGER FORUMS WHO HAVE MENTIONED RADIATOR PROBLEMS ON THEIR CHALLENGERS.",
