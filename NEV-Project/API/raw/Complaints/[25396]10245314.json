I'VE HAD IT BACK TO THE DEALER(BIG VALLEY DODGE) AT LEAST 10 TIMES(@75.00 A VISIT) FOR THEM TO REPAIR/REPLACE THE BALL JOINTS/CONTROL ARM. NOW IT'S NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY AND WILL COST $1500.00-$2500.00 FROM DIFFERENT QUOTES I RECEIVED. I CAN NO LONGER ENJOYABLY DRIVE THE VEHICLE. AND I CAN'T EVEN DRIVE IT ON THE FREEWAY AS THE WHOLE FRONT-END SHAKES THE ENTIRE TRUCK ABOVE 50MPH. PLEASE HELP ME. I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE TRUCK OTHERWISE. I JUST WANT DODGE TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND FIX THEIR PROBLEM. THEY MADE A RECALL FOR THE 4X4, WHY NOT THE 2X4 WITH A VERY SIMILAR ISSUE. PLEASE HELP! THIS IS NOT FAIR. OUT OF ALL THE NEW TRUCKS I COULD HAVE BOUGHT, I HAD TO BUY THE ONE WITH A PROBLEM THE MANUFACTURE REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE, EVERYONE I'VE TALKED TO WITH THE SAME TRUCK FROM SIMILAR YEARS (2000-2003) SAYS THEY HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. PLEASE HELP! ALSO, FRONT TIRES BECOME EXCESSIVELY WORN ON THE OUTSIDE TO WHERE I HAVE TO REPLACE AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR WHEN I DRIVE 10000-12000 MILES A YEAR(RIDICULOUS). PLEASE HELP! *TR",
