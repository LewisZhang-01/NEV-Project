WE AUTHORIZED SERVICE AT A COST OF $1425.00.  I WROTE AMERICAN HONDA MOTOR CO AND ASKED THEM TO PAY FOR THE REPLACEMENT OR SHARE IN THE COST SINCE I RESEARCHED MANY TSB'S ON NHTSA WEBSITE INDICATING A PROBLEM WITH THE ABS ON THE 1996 HONDA ACCORD.  MY CONTENTION IS THAT THEY HAD PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF DEFECTS IN THE ABS MODULATOR AND ACCUMULATOR AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE OF THIS SYSTEM.  ON 2/20/03 I RECEIVED A CALL FROM ANGIE OF AMERICAN HONDA CUSTOMER RELATIONS DENYING MY REQUEST.",
