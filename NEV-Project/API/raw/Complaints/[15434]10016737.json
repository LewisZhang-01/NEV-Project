IM TAKING IT IN TOMORROW TO HAVE THE TRANNY REPLACED ALONG WITH SOME O2 SENSORS THAT WENT BAD. ALSO IM HAVING IT CHECKED BECAUSE THE TRUNK AND DRIVERS/FRONT PASSENGER DOOR LEAKS. ALSO THE E BRAKE IS FAILING AGAIN, THERE IS RATTLING COMING FROM THE DRIVERS DOOR AND A SQEAUKING NOISE WHEN I RELEASE THE CLUTCH. PLUS MY SIDE SKIRTS ARE STILL WARPED, ILL HAVE TO REMIND THEM OF THAT. JUST WANTED TO ADD THIS ONE EVEN THOUGH I HAVENT GOTTEN MY CAR TO THE DEALER YET. ALSO JUST WANT TO SAY I OFFICIALLY HATE NISSAN AND THEIR EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER NISSAN AND AM LOOKING INTO A LAWYER TO FILE A LEMON LAW CASE. JUST BECAUSE THE SENTRA IS THE LOW END MODEL CAR DOESNT MEAN YOU HAVE TO TREAT THE OWNERS WITH LESS RESPECT THAN THOSE WITH A 350Z OR A MURANO. IM BUYING A SUBARU AFTER I GET RID OF THIS POS !",
