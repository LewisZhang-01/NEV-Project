I ALMOST GOT INTO MULTIPLE ACCIDENTS (HITTING WALLS, POLES, A BUS) AND WAS EVEN WORSE GOING DOWNHILL. IT TOOK BOTH FEET AND ALL MY WEIGHT TO GET THE TRUCK TO STOP. MY DEALER SAID THE VACUUM PUMP WAS AT 11PSI WHEN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 27. EVENTUALLY SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET INTO A BAD ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.",
