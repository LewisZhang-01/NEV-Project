IN COLD AND HOT WEATHER, THE RUBBER STOPS DO NOT HOLD THE COVER UP.  IN APRIL 2002, THE COVER CAME DOWN AND HIT ME ON THE BRIDGE OF MY NOSE SO HARD THAT I WAS ALMOST KNOCKED OUT.  IT WAS DARK AND FREEZING COLD.  I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED, ROBBER OR ATTACKED.  IF I HAD A CHILD IN MY ARMS, I WOULD HAVE DROPPED IT.  TOYOTA DEEMS THAT THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH THE SHIELD.  I AM PROOF THAT THERE IS AND ASKED THEM TO PLACE A RECALL ON IT BUT THEY REFUSE.   *NLM",
