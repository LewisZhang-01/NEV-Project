I'M SURE IT IS DUE TO THE HARSH ENVIRONMENT IN THE SOUTHWEST BUT COULD VERY WELL BE POSSIBLE AND JUST DUE TO AGE.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE PLASTIC CROSSOVER HOSE ON THE FUEL RAIL IS RUPTURING AND SPRAYING FUEL ON THE DISTRIBUTOR RESULTING IN AN IMMEDIATE ENGINE FIRE AT THE REAR OF ENGINE AND CAN BE A SERIOUS THREAT TO OCCUPANTS.  I HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN LOCATING ANY RECALLS OR HAVING CHRYSLER DEALERS HELP ME IN BRINGING THIS TO CHRYSLER'S ATTENTION.  PLEASE ASSIST IN BRINGING SOME ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER BEFORE SERIOUS INJURY RESULTS.  TO DATE I HAVE HAD TO IDENTICAL CLAIMS WITHIN ONE MONTH-BOTH V8 MODELS 1993 & 1994 WITH A LITTLE OVER 100K MILES WELL MAINTAINED VEHICLES.",
