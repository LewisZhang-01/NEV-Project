OWNER'S LETTERS FOR RECALL NOT SENT OUT BY GM BECAUSE OF INSUFFICIENT PARTS. \"EDMUNDS.COM\" WEB SITE INDICATES THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY INCIDENTS OF FIRE, SOME REPORTED TO NHTSA. I HAVE CONTACTED GM AND THEY HAVE BEEN UNRESPONSIVE.  SINCE I HAVE INSURANCE THEY FEEL THAT IS SUFFICIENT. I AM A SENIOR CITIZEN, MY CAR WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND PAID FOR. NOW I MUST PURCHASE ANOTHER CAR, INCUR DEBT, ALL BECAUSE GM FAILED TO NOTIFY ME THAT THERE WAS A DEFECT THAT NEEDED TO BE FIXED. *TR",
