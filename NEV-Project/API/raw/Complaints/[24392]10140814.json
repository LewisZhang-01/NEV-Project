I FOUND OUT NOW THAT BOTH CARS HAD STEERING RECALLS WHICH WE HAVE NOT BEEN AWARE OF. DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING TO ANYBODY OR DOES THE SEVERE INJURIES OF MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER MEAN NOTHING SINCE THEY ARE NOT DEAD? I CALLED YOUR AGENCY AND WAS TOLD THAT I HAVE TO WAIT. OK .I HAVE THE CAR IN MY HOME AND WAIT.  *JB",
