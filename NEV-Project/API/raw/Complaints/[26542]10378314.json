        "summary": "I PURCHASED A NEW 2009 MAZDA 3. ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS AND ON TWO DIFFERENT TIRES I HAVE EXPERIENCED A TPMS ALARM FOLLOWED BY A RAPID DEFLATION OF TIRE PRESSURE DUE TO THE TIRE VALVE STEM BREAKING OFF. FORTUITOUSLY, BOTH TIMES THIS OCCURRED WHILE I WAS DRIVING IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AT A LOW RATES OF SPEED. I AM CONCERNED OF THE CONSEQUENCES IF THIS OCCURRED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. MAZDA CLAIMS THIS IS DUE TO CORROSION INDUCED BY METAL AFTER-MARKET VALVE STEM CAPS, BUT THE CAPS I HAVE ARE FACTORY ORIGINAL AND APPEAR TO BE MADE OF PLASTIC. I BELIEVE MAZDA HAS A DESIGN/MATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION ISSUE WITH THESE ALUMINUM VALVES STEMS AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE REDESIGNED AND REPLACED. IN BOTH CASES I HAD TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER AND HAVE NEW STEMS INSTALLED BUT I NOW FEAR THE REMAINING ORIGINAL STEMS WILL SHEAR OFF OR THE PROBLEM WILL REPEAT ITSELF WITH THE NEW STEMS.  *LN",
