AT APPROXIMATELY 69,000 MILES WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 35 MPH THE TRANSMISSION LITERALLY BLEW UP AND THE VEHICLE CAME TO A SUDDEN STOP AND NEARLY LEFT THE ROAD. A PART HAD BROKEN OFF FROM THE INSIDE OF THE DIFFERENTIAL AND BLEW A 6 INCH BY 3 INCH HOLE THROUGH THE CASING BETWEEN THE DIFFERENTIAL AND TRANSMISSION. THE CASING DEBRIS THAT BLEW INTO THE TRANSMISSION COMPLETELY MANGLED THE TRANSMISSION. NO ONE WAS INJURED ONLY BECAUSE OF THE SLOW SPEED OF THE CAR AT THE TIME.  WE HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE TRANSMISSION AND THE MECHANIC'S REPORT. *JB",
