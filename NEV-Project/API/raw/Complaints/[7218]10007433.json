I HAVE NOT DRIVEN A CAR SINCE THIS ACCIDENT. IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM A NURSE SAID I HAD A POSSIBLE SPINAL COMPRESSION FRACTURE.  I THOUGHT MY CAR WAS SUPPOSE TO HAVE AIR BAGS, I SAW THE CAR FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE ACCIDENT YESTERDAY. THE WHOLE CAR IS BEAT UP...THE ROOF, THE FRONT, THE BACK BOTH SIDES, AND NOT EVEN 1 OF THE AIR BAGS DEPLOYED. I AM SO GRATEFUL MY CAR HAD SUCH A HIGH SAFETY RATING... YEAH RIGHT. NOW I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE ANY CAR. AND NOW THE WORDS AIR BAG SAFETY ARE A JOKE TO ME.  *PH  *JB    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**768013",
