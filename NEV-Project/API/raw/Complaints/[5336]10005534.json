NOW AT 75K WE ARE ON 3RD REBUILT TRANS TO BE PUT IN NEXT WEEK. 1ST 2 REBUILT ONES DIDN'T LAST 10 MILES BEFORE SAME LOUD CLUNK IN REVERSE STARTED AGAIN. HONDA NEEDS TO BE FORCED TO REPLACE THIS PROBLEM WITH NEW TRANS, NOT REBUILT ONE, AND 3/36 WARRANTY.  I DIDN'T PAY TOP DOLLAR FOR A CAR TO HAVE A 3 REBUILT TRANS BY 75K.  IT IS APPARENT THAT REBUILTS AREN'T ANY BETTER THAN ORIGINAL TRANS.  THE 100K EXTENSION OF WARRANTY IS USELESS.  HONDA CALLS IT 'GOODWILL'.  SOUNDS MORE LIKE WILLINGFUL NEGLECT & FRAUD.  LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS FILED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ALREADY.",
