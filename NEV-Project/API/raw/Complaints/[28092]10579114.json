        "summary": "WAS HOOKING UP A TRAILER TO THE BACK,  AS I BACKED UP I COULD NOT SEE THE TRAILER ALIGNMENT IN THE CAMERA DUE TO DARKNESS.  I PUT THE SUV INTO PARK, VISUALLY VERIFIED THE SHIFTER WAS IN PARK AND TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE AND THE VEHICLE STAYED IN PLACE. WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING I GOT OUT TO VISUALLY SEE HOW I WAS LINED UP WITH THE TRAILER. I DID NOT APPLY THE PARKING BREAK.  I LEFT THE DRIVERS DOOR OPEN AND AS I PASSED THE LEFT REAR DOOR THE TRANSMISSION JUMPED OUT OF PARK AND INTO REVERSE. I JUMPED BACK INTO THE SUV AND STOPPED THE VEHICLE. THE MOVEMENT WAS SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED HAVING HOOKED UP TRAILERS FOR MANY YEARS BUT NOT IN THIS EXPEDITION BUT IN AN EXPEDITION I OWNED FROM 2004 TO 2012 AND SEVERAL DIFFERENT PICKUPS. THIS ONE MOVED ENOUGH AND STRONG ENOUGH IN THESE FEW SECONDS TO PUSH THE TRAILER INTO A FENCE AND WIPED OUT A METAL FENCE POST AND A SECTION OF WOOD FENCE. IT ALSO RAMMED THE TRAILER INTO THE REAR BUMPER AREA ABOVE THE HITCH.  THIS ISN'T A COMPLAINT BUT I NEED TO KNOW IF THIS HAS BEEN REPORTED BY ANY OTHER EXPEDITION OWNERS WITH THIS TRANSMISSION.  *JS",
