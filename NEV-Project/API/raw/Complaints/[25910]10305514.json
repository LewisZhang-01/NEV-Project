WE HAVE, HOWEVER, NOTICED A \"GLITCH\" THAT MIGHT BE RELATED TO THE SAME PROBLEM THAT THE PRIUS HAS AND THOUGHT WE SHOULD REPORT IT.  OCCASIONALLY, WHEN WE STEP ON THE BRAKE, AND AFTER THE CAR IS SLOWING DOWN, THE ENGINE WILL SURGE FORWARD AS IF IT WANTS TO ACCELERATE AGAIN.  PUMPING THE BRAKES WORKS AND THE CAR STOPS.  I DON'T THINK THIS IS A PEDAL PROBLEM BUT A COMPUTER PROBLEM.  SINCE WE NEVER TAILGATE AND WE ALWAYS ALLOW FOR DISTANCE TO STOP, THIS HAS NEVER POSED A PROBLEM FOR US BUT IT IS AN ISSUE WORTH NOTING. *TR",
