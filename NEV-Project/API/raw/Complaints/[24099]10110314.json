THE SHOULDER HARNESSES CONSTANTLY COME LOOSE FROM THE RESTRAINT LOCKS LOCATED IN THE BACK OF THE INFANT SEAT. IT IS ASSUMED THAT LOCKS ARE MADE TO ALLOW FOR ADJUSTMENTS. HOWEVER, THE SLIGHTEST PRESSURE TO THE STRAPS AND THE STRAPS COME LOOSE FROM THE LOCKS. MY CONCERN IS THAT, IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT, THE STRAPS WOULD COME LOOSE. I CONTINUOUSLY RE-LOOP THE STRAPS INTO THE RESTRAINTS - ALMOST EVERY TIME I PUT MY SON IN OR TAKE HIM OUT OF THE SEAT.   *JB",
