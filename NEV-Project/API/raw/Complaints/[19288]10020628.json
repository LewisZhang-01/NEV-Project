I HAVE TAKEN IT IN TO A REPAIR FACILITY AND THEY HAVE REPLACED NUMEROUS PARTS AND THE PROBLEM STILL PERSISTS.  THEY BELIEVE THERE IS AN ELECTRICAL SHORT IN THE STEERING COLUMN THAT THEY CANNOT LOCATE.  I HAVE TWO OTHER FRIENDS WHO ALSO OWN CHRYSLER  PRODUCT MINIVANS AND THEY ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS.  IF THIS DOES NOT BECOME THE SOURCE OF RECALL YOU CAN BE SURE THAT I AND MY FRIENDS WILL NO LONGER BE DRIVING CHRYSLER MINIVANS IN THE FUTURE.    TIMOTHY GLESMANN  WINDSOR, COLORADO",
