THE FAILURE OCCURRED EACH TIME THE VEHICLE WAS DUE FOR AN OIL CHANGE. THE NOISE STOPPED WHEN THE CONTACT REMOVED HIS FOOT FROM THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHO STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS LOW ON OIL, WHICH CAUSED THE TIMING CHAIN TO SLIP. THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED, BUT THE FAILURE RECURRED. THE MANUFACTURER ADVISED THE CONTACT TO HAVE AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST COMPLETED. THE OIL CONSUMPTION TEST HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETED. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 108,600.",
