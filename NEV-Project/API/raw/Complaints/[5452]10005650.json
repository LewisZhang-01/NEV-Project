THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR LOCK HAS GONE BAD YOU CAN LOCK ALL THE DOORS WITH THE REMOTE BUT HAVE TO LOCK THE DRIVERS SIDE BY HAND AND IT MAKES A LOUD BUZZING SOUND WHEN LOCKING & UNLOCKING. OUR TIRES HAD\\VE ALREADY HAD TO BE REPLACED WITH ONLY 50,000 MILE ON THE VEHICLE THE IN DEC 2002 THE VEHICLE STARTING MAKING A LOUD WHINING SOUND WHEN REACHING SPEEDS OVER 45+ THE SOUND WOULD INCREASE UPON LETTING UP ON THE GAS PEDAL. IT INCREASING BECAME WORSE WHERE IT WOULD CONSTANTLY WHINBEALL THE TIME AT ALL SPEEDS AND ALSO WHEN COMPLETELY STOPPED. WE HAVE HAD TO KEEP TAKING IT BACK TO BE WORKED ON 3 TIMES SO FAR, THEY HAVE REPLACED THE WHOLE TRANSMISSION INCLUDING THE TORQUE CONVERTER, TRANSFER CASE , FUEL INJECTION SYSTEM AND THE NOISE STILL PERSIST. I HAVE DONE SO MUCH RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET AND SEE THAT CHRYSLER REFUSES TO DO A \"[XXX]\" THING ABOUT ANY OF THESE PROBLEMS OR THESE LEMON VEHICLES. WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO GET THEIR HELP AND FOR THEM TO SEE THESE VEHICLES HAVE TOO MANY PROBLEMS.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
