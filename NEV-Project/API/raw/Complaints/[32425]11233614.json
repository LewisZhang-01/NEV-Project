I AM ON TOP OF MY ROUTINE MAINTENANCE AND HAVE JUST HAD MY TRUCK SERVICED 3 WEEKS AGO. ON 7/20/19 MY TRUCK'S BRAKES COMPLETELY FAILED WHILE DRIVING FROM MY HOUSE ON A RESIDENTIAL ROAD. I HAD TO USE MY EMERGENCY BRAKE TO STOP MY VEHICLE FROM GOING THROUGH A STOP SIGN. THANKFULLY, I WAS NOT INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT. MY MASTER CYLINDER HAD LOST ALL ITS FLUID BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF LEAKS. I ADDED BRAKE FLUID AND I COULD SEE IT LEAVING THE RESERVOIR. IT APPEARS TO BE LEAKING INTO THE BRAKE BOOSTER. I HAD TO HAVE MY TRUCK TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND I'M WAITING TO HEAR BACK FROM THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT.",
