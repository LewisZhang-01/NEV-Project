AT THAT TIME THE O2 SENSOR HAD WENT BAD SO THAT WAS REPLACED AND WE WERE ALSO ADVISED THAT IT WAS WAY PAST DUE ON TRANSMISSION FLUID WHICH WAS THEIR FAULT SO THEY REPLACED THAT AS WELL. A FEW MONTHS WENT BY AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. THESE WERE ONCE REPLACED AGAIN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE CAR. ALSO ABOUT 4 TO 5 MONTHS LATER THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME BACK ON AND THE CAR WAS SPUTTERING AND THEN WOULD NOT START BECAUSE THE SPARK PLUGS WIRES WERE FRIED AS IF THEY HAD CAUGHT ON FIRE SO THEY TOO REPLACED THAT WITH ALL NEW ONES. I ASKED THE MANAGER THERE AT THE DEALERSHIP WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE WARRANTY RUNS OUT CONSIDERING IT HAD 34,000 MILES ON IT WHEN WE BOUGHT IT HE STATED THAT THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. WELL NOW SINCE THEN WE HAVE MOVED AND THE SAME PROBLEM KEEPS HAPPENING THE AIRBAG LIGHT IS ON OF WHICH WE NEVER RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF THIS THAT IT WAS A RECALL, THERE IS THE ENGINE LIGHT ON AGAIN AND THE CAR WILL NOT EVEN START I HAVE A 13 MONTH OLD BABY AND NOTHING TO DRIVE.*JB",
