        "summary": "I HAVE A 1997 HONDA PRELUDE SPORT-SHIFT AUTOMATIC.  LIKE MOST OWNERS OF THIS TYPE OF VEHICLE, THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT.  THE GEARS BEGIN TO SLIP AND WILL NOT ENGAGE.  THE DEALER WANTED $4000 TO GET A REBUILT TRANSMISSION.  I HAD IT REPLACED, BUT THEN ABOUT 20,000 MILES LATER, IT WENT OUT AGAIN.  THIS TIME THE FIRST GEAR DID NOT ENGAGE.  I AM BASICALLY AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR AROUND ANYMORE.  I DO NOT WANT TO GET IT REBUILT AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT MAY AS WELL BREAK AGAIN.   HOWEVER, THE 2000-01 HONDA PRELUDES WITH THIS TYPE OF TRANSMISSION GET AN EXTENDED WARRANTY AND I FIND IT VERY UNFAIR THAT THE SAME EXACT CAR WITH THE SAME EXACT TRANSMISSION GETS AN EXTENDED WARRANTY, BUT THE 1997-99 PRELUDES DO NOT.  IF HONDA KNOWS OF THE FAULTY TRANSMISSIONS, WHY NOT REPLACE ALL OF THE TRANSMISSIONS INSTEAD OF THE LATER YEAR ONES?  I USED TO LOVE HONDA VEHICLES, UNTIL I LEARNED OF MANY OTHERS WITH THIS SAME EXACT PROBLEM.   *JB",
