IN EACH CASE THE INBOARD PAD HAD EXCESSIVE WEAR AND THE OUTBOARD PAD DID NOT.  I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THE WEAR INDICATORS ARE ON THE OUTBOARD PADS, THIS PRESENTS A LACK OF WARNING TO THE DRIVER THAT THE BRAKES ARE IN NEED OF SERVICE.  THE CALIPERS HAVE BEEN REPLACED ONCE AND THIS DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.*JB",
