NOW ALL OF THEM DO NOT WORK EXCEPT EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE ONE OR TWO OF THEM MIGHT START WORKING FOR AWHILE THEN THEY WILL STOP WORKING. WITH ALL THE OTHER COMPLAINTS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT AND CHEVROLET SHOULD BE MADE TO FIX IT AT THEIR EXPENSE. THEY LET FAULTY PRODUCTS GO THRU QC NOW THEY NEED TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THANK YOU.  *TR",
