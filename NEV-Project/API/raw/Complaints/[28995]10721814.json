I TOOK MY CAR TO THE VANDERGRIFF HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THIS WAS HAPPENING TO OTHERS AND IT WAS THE FLEX COUPING IN THE STEERING COLUMN DUE TO MATERIAL FAILURE WHICH COULD RESOLUTE IN LOSS OF STEERING CAPABILITY INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH. I WAS TOLD THE ORIGINAL MATERIAL IN THE STEERING WHEEL IS A THICK PIECE OF PLASTIC AND COULD CRACK EASILY AND HYUNDAI HAD SENT A REPLACEMENT PIECE, WHICH IS MORE FLEXIBLE AND DURABLE, TO THE DEALERSHIPS BUT I WAS FORCED TO PAY NEARLY $500 EVEN THOUGH HYUNDAI IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM. I INQUIRED ABOUT A RECALL LINKED TO THE PROBLEM AND WAS TOLD, THERE IS NO CURRENT RECALL. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE.",
