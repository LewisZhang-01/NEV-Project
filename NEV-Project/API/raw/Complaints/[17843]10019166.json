        "summary": "THE TRANSMISSION IN MY 1999 MAZDA 626 BURNED UP AT 51, 590 MILES.  TWO DELAER MECHANICS SAID THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO DRIVING AT SPEEDS OVER 70MPH FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME.  ONE OF THEM SAID HE HAS SEEN A LOT OF THIS  IN THE 626S FOR A FEW YEARS .  OF COURSE, MAZDA NO LONGER MAKES THE 626.  I WAS DRIVING BETWEEN 75 AND 80MPH FOR APPROXIMATELY 2.5 HOURS.    IT TURNS OUT MAZDA DID NOT INSTALL TRANSMISSION COOLERS ON THE 626 FOR SEVERAL YEARS.  THE COOLER, ACCORDING TO MAZDA, IS AN AFTER FACTORY PART.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE CONSUMER IS NOT TOLD THAT THEIR CAR DOES NOT HAVE THIS AND THAT IF THEY DRIVE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME THEY MAY FACE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN REPAIRS.  THE COOLER, WHICH MAZDA DOES NOT MAKE, COSTS AROUND $100.00 DEPENDING ON LABOR, ETC.    MY CAR HAD JUST GONE OUT OF WARRANTY, AND I HAD THE  TRANSMISSION AND ENGINE CHECKED WHILE UNDER WARRANTY TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS SAFE AND WELL-WORKING.  I HAD TAKEN IT IT FOR THE CHECK JUST MONTHS BEFORE, AND THE MECHANIC SAID EVERYTHING WAS FINE.   I HAVE SPOKEN WITH MAZDA USA (1-800-222-5500) AND THEY CALIM LITTLE RESPONSIBILITY, BUT DID OFFER TO PAY FOR PARTS (THANK YOU).  THE BEST BET FOR ANYONE WITH SIMILAR PROBLEMS, ISSUES IS TO CALL MAZDA, PLACE YOUR COMPLAINT WITH THE NHTSA, CARREVIEW.COM, SAFETYALERTS.COM, MSNAUTOS, AND WHOEVER ELSE YOU CONSIDER PERTINENT.  MY INTENT IS TO INFORM DRIVERS;  I WISH I HAD BEEN.  IT WOULD HAVE SAVED ME A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY, AND I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE MADE IT TO THE GOOD FRIEND'S WEDDING I MISSED THAT DAY.",
