I WAS DOING RESEARCH OF THE INTERNET AND FOUND MANY OF THESE LIMITED PRODUCTION CARS WITH DEFECTIVE ENGINES AND MOST OWNERS HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED AND ASKED TO PAY SOME OR ALL OF THE REPAIR BILL. SEVERAL OF THE OWNERS AND MYSELF ARE HAVING TO HIRE ATTORNEYS TO TRY TO MAKE HONDA FIX THESE CARS AND RENT CARS IN THE MEAN TIME. HONDA WILL NOT DISCUSS OR RETURN CALLS WITH ANY OF US. HONDA HAS TOLD EACHOF US THAT THE DECISION IS FINAL! I CAN PROVIDE NAMES OF OTHERS IF NEEDED",
