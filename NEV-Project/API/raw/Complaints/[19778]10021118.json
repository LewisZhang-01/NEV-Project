INDICATOR LIGHTS CAME ON. I WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE CAR. I WAS EXTREMELY FORTUNATE THAT THIS DID NOT CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. SINCE THEN I FEEL VERY UNSAFE WHENEVER DRIVING THE CAR, WONDERING IF IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN. A CAR STALLING WITHOUT ANY INDICATION AND FOR NO REASON IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND CAN POTENTIALLY CAUSE FATAL ACCIDENTS. I BELIEVE THIS CAR NEEDS TO BE RECALLED FOR THE SAFETY ALL DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS ON THE ROAD, SINCE IT CAN HAPPEN AT ANYTIME, WITHOUT WARNING. I RECENTLY FOUND OUT THAT THE MANUFACTURER IS AWARE OF THIS DEFECT, AND I AM ABSOLUTELY APPALLED AND OUTRAGED THAT THEY ARE CONTINUING TO SELL VEHICLES THAT COMPROMISE THE SAFETY THEIR CONSUMERS. *AK",
