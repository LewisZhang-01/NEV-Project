WE TOO EXPERIENCED HEAVY JERKING OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AT INTERMITTENT TIMES AND REPORTED TO THE DEALER WHO COULD NOT REPEAT THE OCCURRENCE AND TOOK NO ACTION.  DREHER HOLLOWAY.  AT 48,000 MILES, THE TRANSMISSION FAILED AND THE DEALER CLOSEST TO THE INCIDENT, MERRIMACK STREET GARAGE,  RECOMMENDED REPLACEMENT, NOT REPAIR.   RENTAL CAR AND REPAIR, ALMOST $4000.   GM IS NOT COVERING THE COST OR ADMITTING ANY OWNERSHIP OF THE PROBLEM.  DREHER HOLLOWAY IS NO LONGER AN OLDS DEALER.  THEY DID A \"30,000 MILE GM SERVICE PLUS SERVICE ON THE TRANSMISSION, THAT PROVIDES EXTENDED TROUBLE FREE SERVICE\".   THAT WAS $400 WASTED.  IS THIS ACCEPTABLE PERFORMANCE?  *NLM",
