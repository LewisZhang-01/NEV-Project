        "summary": "I PULLED INTO MY PARKING SPOT IN MY CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX, WITH MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE PEDAL (AT ZERO MPH).  AS I WAS TRYING TO PUT IT INTO PARK, THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY LURCHED FORWARD AND JUMPED INTO THE HILLY WOODS.  I PRESSED HARDER ON THE BRAKE PEDAL BUT IT WOULD NOT STOP OR SLOW DOWN AND I WASN'T ABLE TO CONTROL THE STEERING.  THE CAR CONTINUED GOING THROUGH THE HILL FULL OF LARGE TREES.  FINALLY THE VEHICLE ONLY STOPPED WHEN IT CRASHED INTO A TREE.  I HAD A HARD TIME OPENING THE DOOR TO GET OUT OF THE CAR BECAUSE IT WAS WEDGED AGAINST SAID TREE.  IF THE CAR DIDN'T CRASH INTO THE TREE, IT WOULD HAVE CONTINUED DOWN THE EMBANKMENT TO CRASH INTO 5 CARS BELOW AND THE RESULTS WOULD'VE BEEN MORE DISASTROUS.   THE FOLLOWING SHOULD BE NOTED:  1)AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY  2)VEHICLE IS BRAND NEW ' I PURCHASED IT ON 9/1/17 FROM DEALERSHIP WITH ABOUT 17 MILES ON IT  3)  UNABLE TO ASCERTAIN HOW FAST THE VEHICLE WAS TRAVELING IN THE WOODS (HUGE TREES); MY AIM WAS TO STOP THE VEHICLE COMPLETELY TO AVOID A POTENTIAL DISASTER",
