FROM TALKING WITH A FEW PEOPLE THAT OWN THE SAME MODEL THEY HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE.  IT SEEMS TO BE A DEFECT FROM GM.  I HAVE NOT HIT ANY MAJOR POT HOLES OR APPLIED ANY PRESSURE WHAT SO EVER TO THE DASH.  NOW IT'S SO BAD THAT IT RATTLES WHEN DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE ESPECIALLY WITH GM NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ERROR.",
