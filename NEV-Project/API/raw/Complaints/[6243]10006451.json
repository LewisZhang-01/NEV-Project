IT APPEARS THAT THIS IS A SOMEWHAT COMMON FAILURE.  REQUEST THAT THIS MATTER BE LOOKED INTO AS THE COST OF REPAIR IS SOMEWHAT HIGH AT $88.06 FOR THE PART AND 136.80 FOR LABOR.  I THINK THAT THIS ITEM IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.     * SCC     ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****750168",
