THE FIRST AT APPROXIMATELY 18,000 MILES; THE SECOND AT APPROXIMATELY 43,000, AND NOW AGAIN JUST 1500 MILES LATER!  CLUTCH ACTUALLY DISENGAGED PERMANENTLY ON THE SHOP FLOOR WHILE THE DEALER WAS EXAMINING THE CAR -- HE WAS POKING AROUND THE BEARING AND IT \"FELL OUT\" OF ALIGNMENT, COMPLETELY PREVENTING THE CLUTCH FROM WORKING.  THIS COULD'VE HAPPENED TO ME ON THE ROAD, WHILE DRIVING.*JB",
