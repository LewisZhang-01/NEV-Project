THE 1999 NEEDED TO HAVE THE ROTORS TURNED AT APPROXIMATELY 19,000 MILES.  I TRADED THAT TRUCK IN FOR MY PRESENT 2002 F350 SUPER DUTY.  SURPRISE.....SURPRISE THIS VEHICLE HAS RECENTLY TURNED 20,000 MILES AND THE ROTORS ARE NOW WARPED. YIPPIE!!!! I BELIEVE THIS MONDAY JUNE 23 THE ROTORS WILL BE UNCEREMONIOUSLY TURNED.  PERHAPS FORD SHOULD ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE SUFFERS AN INJURY OR A FATALITY.  *NLM",
