IN EACH CASE THE VEHICLE WAS COASTING AT A SLOW SPEED, I WAS NOT APPLYING MY FOOT TO THE GAS PEDAL AT THE TIME. THE ELECTRICAL POWER DID NOT DIE, NOR WAS THERE JERKING OR NOISE TO INDICATE THE ENGINE HAD STOPPED. THE ONLY SIGN THAT THE ENGINE HAD STALLED WAS THE \"MALFUNCTION INDICATOR LAMP\" CAME ON, AND NO ACCELERATION POWER. I STILL HAD LIGHTS, RADIO, FAN, ETC. LUCKILY THERE WERE NO OTHER VEHICLES IN BACK OF ME AT THE TIME. IN ORDER TO RESTART THE CAR, I HAD TO SHIFT FROM DRIVE TO NEUTRAL, TURN THE IGNITION KEY TO RE-START, THEN SHIFT BACK INTO DRIVE. FOR EACH INCIDENT, THE CAR RESTARTED RIGHT AWAY.  *TR",
