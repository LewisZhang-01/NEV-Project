I IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO SLOW THE VEHICLE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN A MUCH LOUDER NOISE AND MORE VIOLENT SHAKING GRIPPED THE VEHICLE.  I WRESTLED WITH THE STEERING WHEEL OF THE TRUCK AS IT LURCHED IN ERRATIC MOVEMENTS. I LUCKILY WAS ABLE TO MOVE IT TO THE FAR LANE ONTO A SHOULDER. HOW, I AM NOT SURE SINCE TRAFFIC WAS HEAVY AND A SEMI WAS CLOSING IN ON THE RIGHT SIDE.  WHEN I EXITED THE TRUCK AND LOOKED AT THE FRONT, I SAW A TIRE ALMOST COMPLETELY DISINTEGRATED WITH THE OUTSIDE RUBBER STRIP SEPARATED FROM THE MANGLED INNER PORTIONS OF THE TIRE.  IT HAD LITERALLY COME APART AND HUNG ONTO THE RIM IN RUBBER RAGS.  *JB        ****DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****734312",
