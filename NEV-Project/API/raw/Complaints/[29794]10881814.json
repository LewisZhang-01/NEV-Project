TOOK TO THE NEAREST NISSAN DEALER - 92 MILES AWAY- WAS TOLD IT WAS THE SENSOR, THEY HAD NO PART, WOULD COST $2,000 TO REPLACE AND MIGHT NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. VEHICLE HAS NEVER BEEN IN ANY KIND OF ACCIDENT AND HAS BEEN REGULARLY SERVICED. THIS IS THE SAME PROBLEM NISSAN HAS RECALLED LOTS OF OTHER MODELS FOR - THEY SHOULD COVER THIS!
