THIS IS A CAR THAT IS BARELY A YEAR OLD AND HAS 23,000 MILES ON IT.  I EXPECT BRAKES TO LAST LONGER ON THIS AND WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR NEW BRAKES.  WHEN I REFUSED, AND THROUGH MUCH HASSLE, THE DEALER REPLACED THEM AT NO CHARGE.  MOST OF THE MILES ON THIS CAR ARE HIGHWAY MILES AND I WOULD EXPECT JEEP TO MAKE A BETTER PRODUCT.  THIS IS AFTER I HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALER TWICE IN ONE DAY FOR THE CAR COMPLETELY TURING OFF WHILE DRIVING.  THIS PROBLEM HAPPENED AFTER HAVING THE CAR FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS.",
