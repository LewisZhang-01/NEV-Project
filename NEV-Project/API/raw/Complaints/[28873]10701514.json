WE DO REGULAR MAINTENANCE ON THE CAR AND NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT. IT WAS NOT UNTIL IT REACHED OVER THE 50,000 MILES HE STARTED TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH IT. THE CHECK FUEL INLET LIGHT KEEPS COMING ON ABOUT EVERY OTHER WEEK AFTER WE PUT FUEL IN THE VEHICLE. WE READ THE MANUAL, AND DID AS IT SAID TO FOLLOW THE STEPS AS SUGGESTED. IT WORKS FOR A WHILE BUT THE MESSAGE KEEPS COMING BACK. THIS WEEK, THE MOTOR SERVICE LIGHT COME UP, AND IT SCARED ME TO DEAD. I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT THERE IS A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  I'M WONDERING HOW COME THEY HAVEN'T MADE A RECALL. I DON'T WANT TO TAKE MY CAR IN TO GET IT FIX IF ITS SOMETHING THAT ITS DEFECTIVE AND THE CAR DEALER MUST TAKE CARE OF IT.
