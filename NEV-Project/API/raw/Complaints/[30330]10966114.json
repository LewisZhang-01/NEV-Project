I ASKED IF THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH MASSEY HYUNDAI AND THEY TOLD ME YES THIS IS A CURRENT ISSUE, AND COULD NOT BE RECALLED BECAUSE IT WAS NOT DANGEROUS. SO ON 3.9.17 AS A RESULT OF NOT FIXING THIS ISSUE WITH MY VEHICLE BECAUSE OF THE PRICE. MY CAR  HAS STALLED OUT ONCE WHILE ON THE INTERSTATE AND ALMOST LOST CONTROL OF MY CAR AND CRASHED. AND A SECOND TIME WHILE TURNING INTO WORK ROAD AND STALLING OUT AGAIN MID TURN AND ALMOST TURNING INTO A DITCH. I WAS TOLD THAT THE FUEL SENSOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND THEY HAD TO DO BOTH BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T SURE WHICH ONE IT IS. IF NOT FIXED COULD RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT, WELL IF THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR MOST HYUNDAI VEHICLES THIS SHOULD BE FIXED BY THE COMPANY WHO MAKES IT NOT THE PEOPLE WHO BUY FAULTY PRODUCTS.",
