AFTER SHUTTING OFF THE HEATER, THE NOISE STOPPED. I TURNED THE HEATER BACK ON AND THE NOISE APPEARED AGAIN BUT STOPPED. BROUGHT IT TO A MECHANIC AND THEY SAID THAT IT WAS THE FAN. I ASKED FOR A PRICE AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE INFORMATION I WAS GIVEN. I THEN DID RESEARCH AND NOTICED THAT THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE FAN AND THE NOISE. NISSAN SHOULD BE HELD RELIABLE /ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS MALFUNCTION.",
