DEALER AND SUBSEQUENT CALL TO PONTIAC BOTH INDICATED THAT THE MATERIAL USED ON BRAKE PADS WEAR MORE QUICKLY SINCE THEY ARE NO LONGER MADE OF THE ASBESTOS MATERIAL. GRANTED AT 22000 MILES IT WAS SOONER THAN EXPECTED.   I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT DUE TO FAILURE TO ROTATE MY TIRES AT THE 6000 MILE MARK, I HAD TO REPLACE 2 TIRES DUE TO WEAR. DEALERSHIP WOULD NOT PASS THE NYS INSPECTION WITHOUT COMPLETING THE WORK... AM I TO EXPECT A BRAKE REPLACEMENT YEARLY? *JB",
