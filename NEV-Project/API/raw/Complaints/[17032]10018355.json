WHY CAN'T I PUT THE CAR SEAT IN THE MIDDLE USING THE INNER MOST LATCHES FROM THE LEFT AND RIGHT SEAT?  IT SAYS IN THE MANUAL AND ONLINE NOT TO, BUT WITH NO REASON WHY.  IT IS OBVIOUSLY THE EASIEST WAY TO INSTALL A CAR SEAT AND A LOT MORE STUDIER THEN THE SEAT BELT.  PLEASE EXPLAIN.  IS IT THAT IT HASN'T BEEN TESTED OR IS IT KNOWN TO BE NOT SAFE?    *JB  THANK YOU.
