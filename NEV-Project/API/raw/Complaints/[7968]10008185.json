        "summary": "OUR 2000 FORD EXPLORER, HAS FOR THE SECOND TIME BURNED THROUGH THE SPARK PLUG WIRES.  THE FIRST TIME THE DEALER REPLACED THE DAMAGED WIRE, BUT DID NOT INDICATE THAT ANY OTHER PROBLEMS EXISTED  THIS PAST WEEK IT OCCURRED AGAIN BUT THE DEALER INDICATED THAT BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE OF THE SPARK PLUG WIRE, FUEL HAS NOW BACKED UP INTO THE TOP SIDE OF THE ENGINE, AND SIGNIFICANT REPAIRS AND THE REMOVAL OF THE FUEL MUST TAKE PLACE.      IT SEEMS THIS CONDITION COULD CAUSE AN ENGINE COMPARTMENT FIRE VERY QUICKLY.  CONSIDERING THE REACTION OF THE VEHICLE WOULD INDICATE THE NEED FOR A TUNE UP ONLY.    I CONTACTED FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND THEY SAID IT WAS A MAINTENANCE PROBLEM AND NOT A FORD PROBLEM.  NEVER HAD A VEHICLE BURN THROUGH SPARK PLUG WIRES BEFORE AND I DON'T SEE HOW A 3 YEAR OLD VEHICLE WOULD EXPERIENCE THIS PROBLEM TWICE.    IT APPEARS TO BE SOMETHING YOU SHOULD LOOK INTO BEFORE A FIRE DOES OCCUR AND CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH. *JB",
