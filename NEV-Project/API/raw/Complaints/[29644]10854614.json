THIS PROBLEM HAS GAINED NATIONAL ATTENTION FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS YET CHRYSLER HAS CHOSEN NOT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR A MANUFACTURING DEFECT; NAMELY INADEQUATE ANTI-CORROSION COATING THICKNESS.  I SPOKE TO A CHRYSLER REPRESENTATIVE TODAY AND THEY OFFERED NO ASSISTANCE WITH THE $3,050 REPAIR/REPLACEMENT COST OF THIS FAILED COMPONENT.  I HAVE ALL OF MY VEHICLE SERVICE DONE AT A CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP.  I'VE HAD THEM INSPECT FOR THIS DEFECT IN THE PAST BUT  THERE WERE PREVIOUSLY NO REPORTED ISSUES.  WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS IN FOR ROUTINE OIL CHANGE YESTERDAY, THE MECHANIC WARMED ME OF THE NOW OBVIOUSLY UNSAFE SITUATION.  IN FACT, I NORMALLY PURCHASE A MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT THROUGH THE DEALERSHIP THAT LASTS TWO YEARS.  THEY DECLINED TO SELL ME THE CONTRACT SITING THAT THE ENGINE COULD POSSIBLY FALL OUT OF THE VEHICLE WITHIN THAT TIME.  I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT CHRYSLER COULDN'T EVEN OFFER TO DISCOUNT THIS SIZABLE REPAIR BILL.  I'VE FOUND NUMEROUS NEWS STORIES ONLINE ABOUT THIS EXACT SAME SAFETY ISSUE OCCURRING AROUND THE US YET NOTHING SEEMS TO BE DONE ABOUT IT.  WHY?",
