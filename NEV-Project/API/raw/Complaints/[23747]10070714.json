I DROVE IT FOR LESS THAN TEN DAYS AND LESS THAN 200 MILES. NOW IT WILL NOT SHIFT OUT OF FIRST GEAR. I TOOK IT TO THE DODGE DEALER WHERE THEY SAID THE TRANSMISSION KICKEDOUT 4 DIFFERANT INTERNAL CODES. THEY SAID IT HAD TO BE REPLACED. THEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAS HAD PROBLEMS WITH THEIR INTREPID TRANSMISSIONS.IF DODGE WOULD HAVE POSTED A LETTER OF THE PROBLEMS THEY HAVE HAD WITH THE   INTREPID TRANSMISSIONS I WOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT A DODGE INTREPID! I LIKE THE CAR BUT THE BANK THAT I RECEIVED THE LOAN THROUGH SAID THE CAR IS NOT WORTH $5,700.00. THAT IS HOW MUCH THAT 1996 DODGE INTREPID WILL END UP COSTING ME. NOT COUNTING THE LOSS OF TRANSPORTATION TO GET TO AND FROM WORK.",
