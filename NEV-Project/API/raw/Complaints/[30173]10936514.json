IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS SCENARIO THAT LEAVES ME WITHOUT POWER STEERING USUALLY IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC.  THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM AMONG JEEPS/CHRYSLER PRODUCTS BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY REFERENCES TO THE ISSUE ONLINE.  FOR EXAMPLE:  HTTPS://WWW.CARGURUS.COM/CARS/DISCUSSION-T29898_DS631498    FOR NOW, ALL I CAN DO IS NOT COMPLETELY FILL MY TANK FOR IT NOT TO HAPPEN.  I'M NOT WHAT THE FIX, IF ANY, THERE IS YET.    IT ONLY OCCURS RIGHT AFTER REFUELING.  THEN THE VEHICLE IS FINE UNTIL THE NEXT TIME IT'S REFUELED.",
