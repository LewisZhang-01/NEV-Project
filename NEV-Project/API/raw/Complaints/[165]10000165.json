THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAD THIS CLEANED.  WHEN I ASKED THE DEALER, HE SAID THIS WAS VERY COMMON WITH THE 4.3 V6 ENGINES.  DEALER RECOMMENDED ADDING FUEL INJECTOR CLEANER TO STOP THE BUILD UP OF CARBON. I HAD BEEN DOING THAT.  SEEMS LIKE IT LESSENED THE BUILD UP BUT DID NOT PREVENT IT.  I SUPPOSE THIS IS GOING TO BE NORMAL MAINTENANCE, SIMILAR TO AN OIL CHANGE.  I HAVE HAD OTHER BLAZERS AND HAVE NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM, IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE MANUFACTURER COULD RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.
