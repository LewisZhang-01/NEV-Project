        "summary": "THERE IS A WELL DOCUMENTED FAULTY DESIGN ISSUE THAT LEADS TO FAILURE OF THE WIRING HARNESS (REAR GATE CORD) TO THE REAR WAGON DOOR/GATE OF THIS MODEL SUBARU OUBACK WAGONS.    FAILURE OF THE WIRING HARNESS HAS AFFECTED ME WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE.    AS THIS ISSUE HAS PROGRESSED, MORE AND MORE WIRES BREAK, COMPLETELY SEVERED, AND LEAD TO THE REAR LOCK NOT WORKING, THEN BACKUP LIGHTS NOT WORKING, REAR DEFROSTER NOT WORKING, WIPER NOT WORKING, AND LICENSE PLATE LIGHT NOT WORKING.    THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, ESPECIALLY THE BACKUP LIGHTS, REAR DEFROSTER, REAR WIPER, AND LOCKING MECHANISM NOT WORKING AT ALL!  THESE COMPROMISE VISIBILITY AND CAR SAFETY.    THIS FAULTY DESIGN, OR FAULTY MATERIAL CHOICE IS CLEARLY SUBARU'S FAULT:  SEVERED ELECTRICAL WIRES, AS A RESULT OF NORMAL USE, SHOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY COMPROMISE SAFETY BY DISABLING BACKUP LIGHTS AND THE REAR LOCK.    WHILE THE REPLACEMENT CABLE ITSELF IS ONLY $63, THE SUBARU DEALERSHIPS WANT TO CHARGE OVER $500 IN LABOR.  I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO RECALL, OR SUPPORT ON THIS ISSUE FROM SUBARU OF AMERICA.  I CANNOT FIND ANY OFFICIAL RESPONSE FROM SUBARU ON THIS ISSUE.    I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO HAVE LOYAL CUSTOMERS LIKE MYSELF, PAY EXCESSIVE LABOR CHARGES TO FIX A SAFETY PROBLEM THAT IS A DESIGN FLAW FROM SUBARU.",
