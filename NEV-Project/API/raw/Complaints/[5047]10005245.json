        "summary": "I HAVE A 2000 FORD FOCUS THAT I HAVE HAD ALLOT OF PROBLEMS WITH. I SPECIALLY ORDERED THIS CAR TO HAVE ALL THE SAFETY FEATURES INCLUDING SIDE IMPACT AIR BAGS, AND ANTI LOC BRAKES. WE ORIGINALLY HAD BOUGHT THE CAR IN CA. THE FIRST PROBLEM HAPPENED AT 3000 MILES THE REAR BRAKES STARTED SQUEALING, AND THE SEAT BELT BUZZER WONT GO OFF. WE TOOK IT TO FORD WERE THEY SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG. WE MOVED TO NC WERE WE NOW LIVE. TOOK IT BACK TO FORD WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT THIS NOW 30,000 MILES. THEY SAID THEY WERE DEFECTIVE, THEY HAD THE CAR OVER NIGHT FOR THE SEAT BELT BUZZER, STILL NO PROBLEM FOUND. SO THEY REPLACED THE BRAKES. WHEN WE PICKED UP THE CAR THE SEAT BELT BUZZER DID THE JOB OF STAYING ON FOR US. IT STOPPED THE SQUEAL PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES. 1 1/2 WEEKS LATER WE HAD AN ACCIDENT. WHITCH I MIGHT ADD THE AIR BAGS DID NOT GO OFF. ALSO IN THE ACCIDENT THE REAR SEAT CAME UNHINGED AND THREW A PLASTIC PIECE THAT HOLDS THE SEATBELT AT THE BACK OF HER HEAD CAUSING A LUMP. MY WIFE SAID THE BRAKES JUST DIDN'T WORK AS THEY DID PREVIOUSLY WITH THE NOISE. I TOOK IT OUT FOR A TEST DRIVE FOUND THE BRAKES WERE NOT ACTING RIGHT, THE CAR WOULD NOT STOP PROPERLY. TOOK IT BACK TO FORD, THEY TOLD US THAT EVERYTHING WAS FINE. A FRIEND OF OURS WAS A FORD MECHANIC AT A DIFFERENT DEALERSHIP WAS GOING TO LOOK AT IT FOR US, HE WAS KILLED THAT WEEK IN A CAR ACCIDENT UN-RELATED. SO WE LOST OUR INSIDE MECHANIC TO TELL US WHAT WAS REALLY HAPPENING. NOW AT 50,000 MILES THE NOISE IS BACK, MY WIFE WHO DRIVES THE VEHICLE SAYS EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THE BRAKES WILL ACT UP AGAIN.    NOW WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE TIME NOR THE PATIENTS TO DEAL WITH THE DEALERSHIPS ONCE AGAIN FOR NOW THE FAN BLOWER ONLY WORKS ON 3 ON THE DIAL AND THE CABLE BROKE TO SELECT DEF, VENTS, ECT. ALONG WITH THE RECALL OF THE WIPER MOTOR, AND THE NEEEDING OF NEW ROTERS ON THE FRONT. THIS CAR TO ME IS A LEMON.",
