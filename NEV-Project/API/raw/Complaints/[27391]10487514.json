THEN I REALIZED THE DRIVER SIDE MOTOR MOUNT HAD BROKEN OFF OF THE ENGINE CAUSING A LARGE HOLE IN THE ENGINE BLOCK. I HAVE TAKEN GREAT CARE OF MY VEHICLE, CHANGED THE OIL EVERY 3,000 MILES, AND THEN THIS HAPPENS AT RANDOM. I DIDN'T HIT ANYTHING TO CAUSE THE MOTOR MOUNT TO BREAK, SO WHY WOULD IT BREAK FOR NO REASON? ANYWAYS, THE LEAKING OIL CAUSED A FIRE BENEATH MY VEHICLE, AND INSIDE THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. BUT I QUICKLY PUT OUT THE FIRE BY A CONTAINER OF WATER I HAD IN MY VEHICLE. I HAD MY 13 YEAR OLD BROTHER WITH ME AND THANK GOD HE OR MYSELF WAS NOT INJURED. BUT IT CAUSED US GREAT FEAR AND STRESS.  *TR",
