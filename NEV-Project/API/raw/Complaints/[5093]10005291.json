        "summary": "OVER THE PAST YEAR, MY 2000 MAZDA PROTEGE ES MAKES A THUMPING NOISE WHEN GOING OVER BUMPS. IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING IS HITTING THE FLOOR. I'VE HAD THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIRS SIX TIMES OVER THE PAST YEAR. AFTER HAVING THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT REPLACES VARIOUS SUSPENSION PARTS, THE NOISE GOES AWAY...ONLY TO RETURN A MONTH OR TWO LATER. THE LAST TIME IT WAS AT THE DEALER WAS ON MONDAY (2/3/03). THE NOISE WAS GONE THEN. HOWEVER, AFTER DRIVING TO AND FROM WORK TODAY (2/4/03), I NOTICED THAT IT CAME BACK TONIGHT. I'M A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO DRIVE THE CAR, SINCE I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW IT IS GOING TO BEHAVE. IF IT'S GOING TO DO THIS AFTER A FEW MILES, WHAT IS IT GOING TO DO ON LONGER TRIPS?",
