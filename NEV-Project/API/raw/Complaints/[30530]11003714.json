NOW WHEN YOU TURN THE STEERING WHEEL THERE IS THIS CLANKING  NOISE WHEN YOU TURN THE WHEEL LEFT AND MY STEERING WHEEL FEELS REALLY LOOSE. THE WHEEL CAN TURN SOME BEFORE THE CAR STARTS TURNING. KIA RECALLED 2014 AND 2015 FOR THIS PROBLEM. PEOPLE WERE LOSING CONTROL AND CRASHING. I AM PAYING FOR THIS CAR AND CAN'T AFFORD TO PARK IT  BUT I AM AFRAID I WILL LOOSE MY STEERING. WHY ISN'T ALL OF THE SOULS BEING RECALLED? I HAVE SEEN WHERE THERE ARE 10 STEERING COMPLAINTS. ISN'T ONE TO MANY? ESPECIALLY SINCE THE 2014-2015S HAD THESE PROBLEMS. WHY DIDN'T THEY GO BACK FARTHER?",
