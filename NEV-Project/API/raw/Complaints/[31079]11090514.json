        "summary": "WE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE NEW FROM AUTO NATION CHRYSLER JEEP & DODGE IN ROSEVILLE, CALIFORNIA ON APRIL 19, 2015, TO TOW FOUR WHEELS DOWN BEHIND OUR MOTORHOME. THE DEALER STATED THAT THIS VEHICLE WAS READY TO TOW WITH A TOUCH OF A BUTTON. ON TWO OCCASIONS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED A SEVERE FRONT WHEEL WOBBLE WHILE TOWING THE VEHICLE, LUCKILY AT SLOW SPEEDS DOWN THE ROAD. WE TOOK IT TO THE DEALER TO FIND OUT WHAT IS WRONG. WE ARE BEING TOLD THAT WE NOW HAVE TO HAVE A SPECIAL WIRING HARNESS INSTALLED ON OUR VEHICLE TO ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM. THE DEALER STATED THAT  THIS IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY AND IT IS AT OUR COST. THE COST OF THIS WIRING HARNESS AND INSTALLATION IS OVER $700.00. WE HAVE COMPLAINED TO THE DEALER THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS. THE DEALER HAS STATED THAT THEY HAVE TRIED TO CONTACT CHRYSLER/JEEP FOR AN ANSWER. I HAVE CONTACTED THE DEALER ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS FOR SIX WEEKS NOW, WITH STILL NO ANSWER. WE ARE NOW COMING UP ON OUR TRAVELING TIME AND CAN NOT TOW OUR CAR AND GO ON ANY TRIPS DUE TO THE LIABILITY OF THIS SITUATION. WE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE HAVING KNOWN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. I HAVE ALSO READ ON THE INTERNET THAT THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM NOW WITH THIS VEHICLE.PLEASE HELP US GET THIS RESOLVED",
