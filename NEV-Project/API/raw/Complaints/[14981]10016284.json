WHAT DOES IT TAKE FOR NHTSA TO EXTEND THE POWER OF CONSUMERS TO GET TOYOTA TO ADMIT TO ITS FAULT, AND TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY?    TSB#: SU00299  TSB#: 012199  TSB#: SU00100  GIVEN THAT THE MASSIVE AMOUNT OF 1997-2001 CAMRY'S SOLD, I AM CONFIDENT THAT THERE ARE MANY FRUSTRATED OWNERS WHO WISH TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM RESOLVED AT THE EXPENSE OF TOYOTA MOTOR SALES.  SOME OWNERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM EARLY, WITHIN THE 3YR/36K MI. WARRANTY PERIOD, WHILE OTHERS ARE LEFT IN THE COLD TO PAY ABOUT $300 TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS.  CONSIDERING THAT THIS IS A MANUFACTURERS DEFECT AND NOT PRIMARILY WEAR AND TEAR, I BELIEVE TOYOTA MOTORS CORPORATION HAS THE OBLIGATION TO EXTEND ITS WARRANTY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.  UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES CAN THE NHTSA DO TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AGAINST DESIGN FLAWS AND DEFECTS SUCH AS THIS ONE?   *NLM",
