THESE WERE ELECTRICAL WIRING PROBLEMS: AC DUE TO BLOWER RESISTOR BURNED OUT AND DEFROST CAUSED BY A RESISTOR BURNED OUT. AC STARTED TO SMELL LIKE SOMETHING ELECTRICAL WAS BURNING. IF THIS WASN'T FIXED ANY SOONER COULD HAVE CAUSED FIRE I'M SURE. NOW I HAVE TO SEE WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED NOW THAT I HAVE SERVICE ENGINE CHECK LIGHT ON. WITH THESE ELECTRICAL ISSUES HAD NO SERVICE ENGINE CHECK LIGHT COME ON. O2 SENSOR REPLACED @ 68,000 AND CATALYTIC CONVERTER CHANGED @ 56,000 AND THE RECALL FOR THIS VEHICLE REPLACED. *TR",
