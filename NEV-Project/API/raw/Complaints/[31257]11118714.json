        "summary": "MY 2006 HHR LOST POWER STEERING. THE LIGHT CAME ON AND IT TOOK ALL I HAD TO STEER IT. EVERYTIME I CUT IT ALL OFF AND CRANK IT BACK UP THE LIGHT WILL GO OFF AND I CAN DRIVE IT FOR ABOUT A MINUTE TO 5 MINUTES USUALLY IN THE LIGHT SAYING POWER STEERING WILL COME ON AND THE STEERING ISSUE WILL OCCUR AGAIN. I LOVE MY HHR AND THIS IS MY FIRST CHEVROLET PRODUCT BUT I REALLY THINK THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL DUE TO THE FACT THAT AFTER MUCH MUCH RESEARCH I HAVE FOUND THAT THE HHR AS WELL AS OTHER CHEVROLET VEHICLES HAVE HUNDREDS TO THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME EXACT COMPLAINT. THE POWER STEERING LIGHT WOULD COME ON AND THEY WOULD LOSE ALL POWER STEERING. THIS SHOULD NOT BE A COST THAT US WHO HAVE PURCHASED AND PUT OUR TRUST OF SAFETY INTO CHEVROLET TO HAVE TO BARE. THIS CAN BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND CAN ACTUALLY LEAD TO VEHICLE FATALITIES DUE TO THE POWER STEERING GOING OUT. CHEVROLET SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIRS OF THE POWER STEERING DUE TO IT BEING A KNOWN FACT BASED ON VERY MUCH RESEARCH AND COMPLAINTS FROM SO MANY OWNERS. THIS FACT SHOWS AND PROVES THAT IT IS THE FAULT OF THE WAY THE CAR WAS DESIGNED OR BUILT OR FAULTY PARTS USED BY CHEVROLET/GM. PLEASE CONSIDER THE DANGER THAT THIS FAULT CAN CAUSE TO OWNERS AND DO A RECALL TO HAVE THESE ISSUES REPAIRED SO THAT IT DOESN'T END UP CAUSING MORE DAMAGE OR TAKING A LIFE BECAUSE SOMEONE LOSES CONTROL OF THERE CHEVROLET DUE TO FAULTY PARTS.
