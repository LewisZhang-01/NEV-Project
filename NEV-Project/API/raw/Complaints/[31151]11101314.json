IT RESULTED  IN THERMOSTAT AND HOUSING ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL COOLANT HOUSING  TO BE REPLACED ABOUT A MONTH AGO.   NOW MY CAR IS BELLOWING WHITE SMOKE AND IDLING FUNNY AND I FIND OUT I'VE BLOWN A GASKET.   MY VIN ISN'T LISTED BUT I SEE OTHER CHEVYS WITH THIS SAME COOLANT HOSE WEAKNESS ISSUE AS MINE.   APPEARS THERE ARE MORE THAN JUST THOSE LISTED.   EXTREMELY COSTLY REPAIR.    ALSO HAVE SIMILAR ISSUE WITH THE FUEL INJECTION/TAKE OFF WITH NO POWER AND SLOW TO GO WHICH HAS ALMOST BEEN DEADLY IN HIGHWAY TRAFFIC.   WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CHEVY.",
