NOW, IN APRIL OF 2003, THE ALTERNATOR IS ABOUT TO DIE YET AGAIN.  MY CAR HAS 99,000 MILES AND IS DRIVEN LESS THAN 10,000 MILES PER YEAR.  FIVE ALTERNATORS IN THREE YEARS IS NOT FROM NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR ON A CAR.  I BELIEVE THERE IS A DEFECT IN THE FORD TEMPO SYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED.  AND I SEE FROM OTHER FILED COMPLAINTS I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM.",
