FIRST MY BREAKS WERE SQUEALING I CALLED THE DEALER, HE SAID NOT TO WORRY ABOUT IT UNTIL I HAD TIME TO COME IN. 1 TO 2 MONTHS LATER, AFTER SEVERAL CALLS ASKING IF IT WAS STILL OKAY TO DRIVE, I TOOK MY CAR IN AND THE ROUTERS AND BREAKS WERE BAD, THEY SD I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT MY CAR IN SOONER. WELL PER THERE REQUEST I TOOK MY TIME. I HAD TO PAY THE GET THIS TAKEN CARE OF.  IT DIDN'T STOP THERE, MY TIRES KEPT GETTING FLATS SO I HAS TO ONCE AGAIN REPLACE AT MY OWN EXPENSES. NOW THE REAL PROBLEMS START, MY CRUISE CONTROL WAS JUST OUT OF CONTROL, MY CAR WOULD ACCELERATE EVERY TIME I WOULD PUT IN ON CRUISE. THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WOULD NOT WORK AND MY RADIO KEPT TURNING OFF BY ITSELF. I HAD ONCE AGAIN AT MY OWN EXPENSES REPLACE MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS CALLING THE MAINTENANCE. DEPT. AT MERIDIAN FORD. THEY FIXED THE PROBLEM. WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL AND IT WAS WORKING FINE FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS IT IS NOW HAPPENING AGAIN! NOW I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE KEY GETTING STUCK AND  WILL NOT TURN, THE TRUNK WILL NOT SHUT, AND MY CAR WILL SHUT OFF WHEN THE CAR IS IN IDLE. IT TURNS OFF IF IN PARK OR DRIVE AFTER ABOUT ONE MIN. IDLE. THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING. AND HAS CAUSED SO MANY FINANCIAL AND STRESS PROBLEMS. I DON'T FEEL SAFE IN THIS CAR AND I FEEL CHEATED!  I WAS SOLD A LEMON! A LIST OF WHAT WAS WRONG WITH MY NEW CAR..BAD BREAKS, BAD ROUTERS, BAD WINDSHIELD WIPERS, BAD CRUISE CONTROL, BAD TRUNK, BAD TIRES, THE KEY GETS STUCK AND WILL NOT TURN, AND NOW IT TURNS OFF WHILE IN IDLE.   ALL THESE THINGS ARE STILL WRONG WITH IT AND ITS COSTING ME MONEY, STRESS,TIME AND IT IS COSTING ME TO BE LATE ON MY CAR PAYMENTS AND OTHER BILLS BECAUSE I HAVE TO PAY FOR ALL THIS CRAP TO BE FIXED! WHY IS THIS HAPPENING! DO I NEED TO GET A LAWYER OR DO YOU NEED TO REPLACE OR FIX MY CAR AT YOUR EXPENSIVE. I HAVE LOST SO MUCH AND FEEL HELPLESS. I HOPE THIS DOES NOT FALL ON DEAF EARS.    *NLM",
