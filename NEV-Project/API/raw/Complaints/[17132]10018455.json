TOOK TO ANDERSON CHEVROLET IN CUPERTINO IN CA AND THEY REPLACED RACK AND PINION. THIS DID NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM OF CLUNKING SOUNDS OVER BUMPS AND WHILE TURNING AT LOW SPEEDS. AT HIGH SPEEDS CAR WANDERS. I HAVE TWO CHILDREN AND I AM AFRAID THAT I AM GOING TO LOSE STEERING LIKE OTHERS INCLUDING POLICE CARS HAVE. NOW CENTURY CHEVROLET SAYS THEY WANT TO LUBE THE INTERMEDIATE STEERING SHAFT, BUT NHTSA COMPLAINTS INDICATE THIS HAS NOT WORKED FOR THEIR SAME EXACT CAR WITH THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM. I HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY AND I WANT MY CAR FIXED BEFORE IT RUNS OUT AND I AM TIRED OF GETTING THE RUN AROUND IN THE MEAN TIME. I WANT THE INTERMEDIATE STEERING SHAFT REPLACED BECAUSE I FEEL THIS IS A REAL SAFETY HAZARD.  *JB",
