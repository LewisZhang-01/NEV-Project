WHEN I STOP THE VEHICLE, I CAN TURN OFF THE ENGINE.  IF I CONTINUE TO TURN THE KEY 90% (BUT NOT ENOUGH TO START THE ENGINE), AND LET OFF, THE GAUGES WILL DROP UP TO 5%.  AFTER 5 MINUTES OF RESETTING THE INSTRUMENTS, THE GAUGES WILL RESET.   HOWEVER, THE NEXT TIME I DRIVE I MIGHT BE GOING THROUGH A SCHOOL ZONE AT 40 INSTEAD OF 25, BUT MY SPEEDOMETER SAYS 80.  CLEARLY UNSAFE.",
