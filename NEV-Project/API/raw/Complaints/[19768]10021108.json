THE LADY IN FRONT OF ME CAME TO COMPLETE STOP MAKING A LEFT TURN.  I THEN QUICKLY STOPPED BUT THE COUPLE BEHIND ME WERE NOT ABLE TO STOP.  A MAJORITY OF THE DAMAGE TO MY CAR TOOK PLACE ON THE BACKEND.  THE FORCE OF THE IMPACT MADE MY CAR HIT THE LADY IN FRONT OF ME.  THE CAR IS A TOTAL LOSS AS IS THE CAR BEHIND ME.  MY COMPLAINT IS ABOUT THE DRIVER\u0019S BUCKET SEAT.  AT IMPACT, THE SEAT COLLAPSED BACKWARDS.  I SEE MANY YOUNG CHILDREN THAT SIT DIRECTLY BEHIND THE DRIVER AND THINK THIS IS A VERY BIG RISK.  IF SOMEONE HAD BEEN IN THE BACKSEAT OF MY CAR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SEVERELY INJURED.  *AK",
