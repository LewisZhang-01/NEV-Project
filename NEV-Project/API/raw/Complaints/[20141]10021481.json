I PULLED OFF THE HIGHWAY TO ALLOW  THE SMOKE TO CLEAR AND PULLED THE HOOD RELEASE. AFTER 5 MINUTES THE CAR CONTINUED TO SMOKE.  I GOT OUT OF THE CAR TO CHECK UNDER THE HOOD.  I NOTICED A BLACK SPOT ON THE HOOD AND HAD THE SENSE TO REALIZE THE CAR WAS ON FIRE WITHOUT TRYING TO LIFT THE HOOD.  I YELLED TO MY MOTHER TO GET OUT OF THE CAR.  I CALLED 911 TO REACH THE POLICE.  WHEN THEY CAME THEY COULD NOT PUT OUT THE FIRE.  THE POLICEMAN CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO PUT OUT THE FIRE.  I THANK GOD MY 3 YEAR OLD WAS NOT WITH ME STRAPPED IN HIS CAR SEAT AS HE USUALLY TRAVELS WITH ME.  THE CAR WAS A TOTAL LOSS IN A MATTER OF MINUTES.  *JB",
