FOUND WEBSITES WITH A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME PROBLEM. THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL. THE DEALER TOLD ME IT WOULD BE $9000.00 TO REPLACE AND INSTALL NEW ENGINE, WHICH IS WORTH MORE THAN THE CAR. NEED MONEY TO FIX. CAR IS GOING TO SIT UNTIL SOMETHING IS DONE. DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSE. JUST SEARCH THE INTERNET AND FIND HOW MANY PEOPLE THERE IS OUT THERE WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.
