        "summary": "I HAVE A '94 LEXUS LS400 ON WHICH THE INSTRUMENT PANEL DISPLAY DOES NOT FUNCTION AT LOW TEMPERATURES.  IT WILL TAKE UP TO AN HOUR OF DRIVING BEFORE THE INSTUMENT PANEL LIGHTS UP AND THE GAGES BECOME VISIBLE.  ONE HAS TO NOTE THAT THIS IS A NEON-LIT INSTRUMENT PANEL WHICH WILL BE TOTALLY DARK DAY OR NIGHT WHEN THE LIGHTING DOES NOT WORK.  THE USER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE ANY WARNING LIGHTS, VEHICLE SPEED AND FUEL LEVEL.  THIS IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM WITH \"90 TO '94 MODEL YEARS AND POSSIBLY LATER ONES ALSO ( I PERSONALLY KNOW OF AT LEAST 10 CASES).  LEXUS IS QUOTING $1,200 TO $1,600 TO REPAIR THIS DEFECT.  BASED ON THE PRICE TAG, MANY PEOPLE WILL BE RELUCTANT TO HAVE IT REPAIRED AND CONSEQUENTLY THERE WILL BE MOTORISTS ON THE ROAD WHO WILL NOT KNOW WHAT SPEED THEY ARE GOING OR WHETHER THEY WILL RUN OUT OF GAS.  I BELIVE THAT THIS IS A SAFETY DEFECT THAT SHOULD BE CORRECTED BY THE MANUFACTURER THROUGH A RECALL.",
