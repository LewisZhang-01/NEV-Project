THE BODY SHOP TOLD ME IT'S DEFECTIVE PRIOR TO YOUR ACCIDENT BECAUSE IT'S NOT EVEN SEALED. I WAS TOLD TO CHECK IF THERE'S A RECALL. WETHER IT IS OR NOT IT'S STILL THE FAULT OF CHRYSLER'S & I HAVE MOISTURE INSIDE IT NOW. IS THIS SOMETHING YOU WILL FIX FOR ME? CAN'T REMEMBER ACTUALL MILEAGE BUT FIFTY NINE THOUSAND SOMETHING. ALSO CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT DATE. NOVEMBER 2018",
