CAR WOULD NOT START (BATTERY WOULDN'T EVEN TURN OVER, YES THE SAME NEW BATTERY) TOWED TO DEALER WHO SAID THEY REPLACED SOME FUSES.   RECENTLY, RADIO WILL NOT POWER ON.  DEALER STATES THE RADIO FAILED, FUSES FINE.  I HAVE SEEN 100S OF REPORTS OF FAILED RADIOS AND DOOR LOCKS IN THE 2010 JETTA. THERE MUST BE A FAULTY ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IN THIS VEHICLE.  CARS THAT ARE 5 YEARS OLD (I HAVE SEEN REPORTS OF THIS HAPPENING WHEN THE CAR IS ONLY 3 YEARS OLD) ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE THESE PROBLEMS. ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS HAVE OCCURRED IN THE PAST YEAR, MILEAGE BETWEEN 100-110K.",
