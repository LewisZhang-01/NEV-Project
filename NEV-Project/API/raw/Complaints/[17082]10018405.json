I WAS TOLD THAT THE CAR SEAT BEING USED WAS NOT SAFE AND SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH  A FIVE POINT HARNESS SEAT. WE HAD BEEN USING A CAR SEAT THAT USES AN OVERHEAD SHIELD THAT WHEN IN PLACE HAS A BAR THAT SHOULD PROTECT THE CHILD FROM INJURY. THE POLICE OFFICER SAID THAT DURING AN ACCIDENT THE BAR IN FRONT OF THE CHILD CAN CAUSE HEAD INJURY.  CAN YOU TELL IF THESE CAR SEATS ARE INDEED UNSAFE? I HAVE CHECKED THE RECALL LIST AND FOUND NOTHING.  GRACO - CENTURY PRODUCTS,   MODEL NO.: A-45600MTO, MANUFACTURED DATE: 2001 10 15,   DATE OF PURCHASE: 12/16/2001.
