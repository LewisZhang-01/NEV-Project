BUT FOUR TIMES NOW - TWO ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE AND TWO ON THE PASSENGER'S SIDE - THE MEDIAL (TOWARD THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR) PIN HAS SHEARED. THIS CAN CAUSE THE VISOR TO HANG DOWN AND OBSTRUCT THE DRIVER'S VIEW AND POTENTIALLY CAUSE AN ACCIDENT. ONE TIME I HAD TO RUBBERBAND THE VISOR TO KEEP IT FROM OBSTRUCTING MY VIEW!          *JB",
