EVERY TIME YOU STEP ON THE BRAKES IN A NEW DIRECTION, FORWARD OR REVERSE YOU HEAR A LOUD CLUNKING SOUND AS THE BRAKES ENGAGE THE ROTORS.  I BELIEVE THIS IS A HAZARD AS WELL AS AN ANNOYANCE.  I DON'T BELIEVE THE BRAKES ARE ENGAGING AS SOON AS YOU STEP ON THE PEDDLE.  THEIR P.R. SPIN SAYS THEY MANUFACTURER ROOM FOR HEAT EXPANSION IN THE BRAKE PADS.  I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD A VEHICLE THAT EXHIBITS THIS PROBLEM.   THE SECOND PROBLEM IS THEIR NOISY GAS TANK SLOSHING THAT IS VERY PROMINENT IN THE VEHICLE.  THIS ONE IS MORE OF AN ANNOYANCE.*JB",
