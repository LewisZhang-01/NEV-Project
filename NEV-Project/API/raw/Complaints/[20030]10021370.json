I HAVE HAD THE TRUCK TO TWO DIFFERENT DEALERS AND THE TECHNICIANS SAY THAT IT IS A DESIGN FAULT.  DRIVING THIS VEHICLE AT NIGHT IS COMPARABLE TO HAVING TUNNEL VISION.  MY TRUCK IS EQUIPPED WITH FOG LIGHTS AND THEY DO HELP WITH THE SIDE VISION BUT THEY ONLY WORK ON LOW BEAM.  EVEN WITH THE FOG LIGHTS  THE AREA TO THE SIDE OF THE TRUCK ARE BLACKED OUT.  IN THE MONTHS THAT I HAVE HAD THIS VEHICLE I HAVE ONLY DRIVEN ABOUT SIX TIMES AT NIGHT.  I DO NOT KNOW ANYONE ELSE THAT OWNS A SIMILAR TRUCK SO I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT IF EVERYONE HAS THIS PROBLEM OR JUST ME.*AK",
