        "summary": "I HAVE A 2006 F150 WITH THE 5.4 ENGINE.  I HAVE NEVER REPLACED THE SPARK PLUGS AND THE TRUCK HAS 144K MILES.  I AM NOW STUCK WITH ~$1800 TO PULL THE CAB TO GET TO THE HEADS TO GET THE PLUGS OUT. 2 MECHANICS CANNOT GET IT OUT NORMALLY.  I AM TOLD THAT A FIX FOR STRIPPING THE HEADS IS WITH A SLEAVE THAT I CANNOT GET OUT OF CYLINDER #8.  I WAS NEVER INFORMED TO HAVE THE PLUGS CHANGED AT 80KTO 100K MILES.  I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.  I THINK THE FIX IS A POOR DESIGN AND I WAS DESIGNED TO COVER ANOTHER PLUG ISSUE.  I AM WONDERING WHY 2 WRONGS DO NOT MAKE A RIGHT AND I AM WONDERING WHAT RECOURSE I HAVE.  I HAVE PURCHASED OR TRADED 3 NEW TRUCKS AND CURRENTLY DRIVE A MUSTANG, ALL PURCHASED IN THE LAST 4 YEARS.  I AM SERIOUSLY WONDERING IF I SHOULD EVER BUY ANOTHER FORD TRUCK AT THIS TIME.  I HAVE BEEN MORE THAN LOYAL TO FORD PRODUCTS OVER THE YEARS. *TR",
