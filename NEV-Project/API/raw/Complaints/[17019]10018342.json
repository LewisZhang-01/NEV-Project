        "summary": "THE ODOMETER ON MY RECENTLY PURCHASED 2002 BUICK CENTURY (FROM A BUICK DEALER WITH 22,000 MILES AND STILL UNDER WARRANTY) APPEARS TO BE OFF BY APPROXIMATELY 4%.  ON A RECENT TRIP OF 450 MILES (A TRIP TAKEN AND MEASURED MANY TIMES IN THE PAST), MY ENDING TRIP MILEAGE REGISTERED AS 467 MILES (AN OVERAGE OF 17 MILES).  ON THE RETURN TRIP, I USED NUMEROUS INTERSTATE MILEAGE MARKERS TO COMPARE DISTANCES.  FOR EACH 100 MILES TRAVELED, THE ODOMETER REGISTERS IT AS 104 MILES.  TO ME, THIS IS AN ISSUE OF THE SPEEDOMETER NOT BEING CORRECT, PLUS MORE MILES ARE REGISTERING THAN ARE ACTUALLY BEING PLACED ON THE VEHICLE.   THIS AFFECTS SERVICE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE RESALE VALUE OF THE VEHICLE. THE DEALER OFFERED ABSOLUTELY NO HELP.  OTHER THAN SAYING THE MILEAGE MARKERS MUST BE OFF - THEY SUGGESTED I USE DIFFERENT SIZE TIRES.  (TO MY KNOWLEDGE THESE ARE THE ORIGINAL TIRES ON THE VEHICLE).   IS THERE NO WAY TO RECALIBRATE THE SPEEDOMETER?  *JB",
