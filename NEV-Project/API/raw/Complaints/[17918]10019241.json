THE LATEST AND MY MAJOR CONCERN IS MY DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AT  A VERY LOW SPEED JUST AFTER LEAVING A PARKING LOT SHE HIT A VERY SMALL POTHOLE AND IMMEDIATELY THE CAR STALLED.  LUCKLY A GENTLEMAN STOPPED AND HELPED HER GET THE CAR OFF THE SIDE.  WE HAVE 40K MILES ON THE CAR.  WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO VICTORY FORD IN LAGRANGE GA.  THE CAR WAS THERE FROM MAY 10-MAY 23 FINALLY REPAIRED AT A COST OF 670.00. MY CONCERN IS THAT I HAVE HEARD AND READ OF HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF THESE FUEL PUMP FAILURES AND AFTER MANY NICE BUT INEFFECTIVE ANSWERS FROM FORD I FEEL THAT SOMEONE WILL BE INJURED SERIOUSLY OR DIE DUE TO THESE FAULTY AND POSSIBLY DANGEROUS FUEL SYSTEMS.  ALSO MY DEALERSHIP PREVIOUSLY WORKED ON THIS FUEL SYSTEM UNDER WARRANTY.  AFTER FILLING THE GAS TANK THE ONLY WAY IT REGISTERED WAS AFTER SLAMMING THE CAR DOORS.  THAT WAS REPAIRED IT SEEMS.   *NLM",
