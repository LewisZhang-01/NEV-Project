EACH ONE HAS REPLACED A PART OR 2 BUT THEY ALL SAY IT IS NOT THE TRANSMISSION NOR THE COMPUTER BUT NONE OF THEM CAN FIX IT.  I JUST KEEP GETTING PASSED DOWN TO ANOTHER SHOP SO THEY CAN GET THEIR $200.00 TO $300.00 FROM ME.  THE DEALERSHIP I PURCHASED IT FROM WILL NOT EVEN CALL ME BACK TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEM AND I HAD PAID AN EXTRA $1800.00 FOR AN ADDITIONAL WARRANTY ON THE VEHICLE.  I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER GMC AGAIN!   *NLM",
