HE EVEN TRIED THE EMERGENCY BRAKE AND IT WOULD NOT STOP. IT FINALLY POPPED UP AND STOPPED. HE WAS VERY FRIGHTENED BY THE INCIDENT. WE HAVE TWO SMALL CHILDREN AND HE REFUSED TO LET THEM RIDE IN IT AGAIN. THEN NEXT DAY WE TRADED IT IN ON A NEW CAR AT A HUGE LOSS TO US. I NOW FIND OUT THAT FORD HAS THIS PROBLEM AND REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. THE RUG DID NOT CATCH IT WAS NOWHERE CLOSE TO IT. THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL MANY PEOPLE DIE AND THEY GET SUED. PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS BEFORE OTHERS ARE HURT.  *NLM",
