FOUND OUT ABOUT A RECALL THAT MY TRUCK NEEDED REGARDING THE BALL JOINTS THAT COULD CAUSE THEM TO BRAKE AND LOSE THE TIRES. WHEN TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THAT I HAD PASSED THE MILEAGE OF 100,000, AND WOULD HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET. IT WAS ONLY 2463 MILES OVER. I THOUGHT RECALLS DON'T HAVE A TIME LIMIT TO GET FIXED? SO NOW I HAD TO FIND A CAR SHOP TO FIX BOTH BALLJOINTS, ON BOTH SIDES. TO TOP IT OFF THE RIGHT SIDE NEEDED A NEW HUB ACCESSORY REPLACED ALSO THAT I AGAIN HAD TO PAY ON MY OWN. WHY ARE SO MANY THINGS GOING WRONG NOW? AND BY READING ONLINE I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THESE SAME ISSUES.  *TR",
