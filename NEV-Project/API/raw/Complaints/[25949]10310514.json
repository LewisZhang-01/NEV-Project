        "summary": "WHILE MOVING MY 2004 FORD ESCAPE IN MY DRIVEWAY THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY ACCELERATED WITHOUT MY FOOT ON THE PEDAL. I STRUCK A BUSH IN MY YARD AND WAS ABLE TO STOP. THE BUSH WAS DESTROYED AND THERE WAS APPROX. $500 DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE. A RECALL REPAIR ON THE ACCELERATOR CABLE WAS PERFORMED BY FORD IN MARCH OF 2005. I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO A FORD DEALER WHO WOULD NOT EVEN LOOK AT THE VEHICLE WITHOUT CHARGING ME. I REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO FORD MOTOR CO. WHO STATED THAT THEY REPAIRED THE ACCELERATOR CABLE WHEN IT WAS RECALLED AND WOULD NOT REPAIR IT AGAIN. I HAVE SINCE HAD THE BUMPER DAMAGE REPAIRED AND WILL HAVE THE ACCELERATOR CABLE INSPECTED BY AN INDEPENDENT GARAGE. I AM LUCKY THAT NO ONE WAS HURT DURING THIS INCIDENT. I AM HESITANT TO DRIVE THIS CAR AGAIN AND I AM VERY CAREFUL WHEN I HAVE TO. I AM A RETIRED POLICE OFFICER AND HAVE SEEN WHAT M/V CRASHES CAN DO. *TR",
