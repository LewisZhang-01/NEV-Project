NOTICED THAT THE STEERING WHEEL WAS LOCKED UP AND I COULDN'T STEER THE VEHICLE.  HAD TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A DEALER WHERE UPON THEY HAD TO REMOVE THE STEERING LOCK TO ALLOW THE CAR TO BE STEERABLE.  THEY FIXED THE PROBLEM BUT AFTER READING AN ARTICLE IN THE FEBRUARY 2003 ISSUE OF CORVETTE FEVER, I THOUGHT IT BEST TO LET NHTSA KNOW OF THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT.  I WAS NOT HURT OR INJURED AND AM FILING THIS ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE TO MAKE YOU AWARE OF IT AND MAYBE TO HELP SOMEONE ELSE WHO OWNS ONE OF THESE VEHICLE TO BECOME AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM   REF.
