ONE DAY IT CUT OFF AND I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP.  I BOUGHT MY VEHICLE BRAND NEW AND THIS PROBLEM HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE THEN. GOODYEAR COULD NOT DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE ISSUE AND THE DODGE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS THE FUEL PUMP.  SO THEY REPLACED MY FUEL PUMP AND THE PROBLEM STILL OCCURS DURING HEAVY RAINS AND GOING THROUGH THE CAR WASH. I REPLACED THE BATTERY A THIRD TIME AFTER CONTACTING ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE.   NOW THE VEHICLE IS MAKING A KNOCKING SOUND. I'M AFRAID IT'S THE ENGINE.  AFTER RESEARCHING, THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE ISSUE WITH THE WIPER COWL LEAKING.  THERE IS A SERVICE BULLETIN 18-006-05 PUT OUT BY CHRYSLER.",
