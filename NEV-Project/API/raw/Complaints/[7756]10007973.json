THAT IS, THERE IS NO MOVEMENT ALLOWED - YOU CANNOT LEAN FOREWARD.  THIS SITUATION MAKES THE BACK CENTER POSITION BELT UN-USABLE.  I BROUGHT THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF THE DEALER, (AND THEY AGREE THAT IT IS UN-WEARABLE), BUT SAY THAT THERE IS NO FIX.  THEY ALSO SHOWED ME THAT THE SAME SITUATION CAN BE FOUND ON OTHER ENVOYS ON THEIR LOT.  I FREQUENTLY CARRY 5 PEOPLE IN THE VEHICLE AND I BELIEVE IT'S DANGERIOUS HAVE ONE OF THE SEATING POSITONS WITH AN UN-WEARABLE SEAT/SHOULDER BELT.",
