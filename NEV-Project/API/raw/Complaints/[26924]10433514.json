PASSENGERS COULD ONLY EXIT THE VEHICLE BY CRAWLING OUT OF THE DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT DOOR.  THE FRONT PASSENGER DOOR AND BOTH REAR DOORS COULD NOT BE OPENED BY USING THE INTERIOR OR EXTERIOR DOORHANDLES.  FURTHERMORE, THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM DISALLOWED ANY UNLOCKING OF THESE THREE DOORS AS WELL.  FORTUNATELY, THE CAR WAS NOT INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT DURING THIS DOOR LOCK ACTUATOR FAILURE.  DURING THE TIME OF THIS INCIDENT, TWO PEOPLE WERE IN THE CAR.  THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT HAVING DOORS WHICH CAN OPEN FROM THE INSIDE OF THE CAR COULD PROVE DEADLY IN AN ACCIDENT.    A LETTER WAS WRITTEN TO BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, LLC BY THE OWNER OF THIS CAR IN THIS REPORT AND THEIR RESPONSE ON OCTOBER 7TH, 2011 WAS, \"WE HAVE NO RESPONSE.\"  *TR",
