NOT SURE HOW MUCH GAS IT WOULD TAKE, I WAS HOLDING THE NOZZLE AND SUDDENLY GAS SPEWED OUT OF THE TANK BEFORE THE PUMP TURNS OFF, SPLASHING OVER ME, MY SHOES AND THE SURROUND PUMP AREA.  I INITIALLY THOUGHT I DID SOMETHING WRONG, HOWEVER THE SECOND TIME I REFUELED, THE SAME THING HAPPENED.  I'VE USED THIS GAS STATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND HAVE NOT HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH OTHER CARS.    THEN, I SEARCHED THE INTERNET TO DETERMINE WHAT I COULD DO ABOUT THE PROBLEM, ONLY TO FIND THAT IT HAS ALREADY BEEN REPORTED, NHTSA HAS RECEIVED NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS BY INTERNET AND DECIDED TO CLOSE THE INVESTIGATION?    THE INTERNET IS A GREAT PLEASE TO FIND RESOLUTIONS FOR PROBLEMS AND QUICKLY COLLECT EXPERIENCES OR ISSUES THAT AFFECT THE PUBLIC.      I'M NOT SURE OF THE NHTSA'S CRITERIA TO ACCEPT COMPLAINTS AND TAKE ACTION, BUT CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THEY ARE TAKING THE APPROPRIATE ACTION BEFORE SOMEONE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED AS A RESULT OF THIS SITUATION.
