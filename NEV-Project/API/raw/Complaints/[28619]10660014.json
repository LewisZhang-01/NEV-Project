        "summary": "THIS MOTORCYCLE SHUT OFF WHILE I WAS RIDING IT ON 1.28.14 - IT WAS TOWED TO THE SHOP AND MECHANIC & SHOP OWNER COULD NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THEY WERE ABLE TO GET BIKE RUNNING AND I PICKED IT UP.  BIKE DIED AGAIN - SAME THING - SHUT OFF WHILE RIDING ON 3.25.14.  THIS TIME BIKE WAS TAKEN TO SHOP AND THEY AGAIN SAID THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHY THIS WAS HAPPENING OR HOW TO FIX IT.  AT THIS POINT I WANTED THEM TO BUY THE BIKE BACK FROM ME AS IT WAS DANGEROUS TO RIDE IF IT WAS SHUTTING DOWN WHILE I WAS RIDING IT.  THE SHOP OWNER PUT ME IN CONTACT WITH ZERO - THE MANUFACTURER TO DISCUSS THIS POSSIBILITY.  ZERO REFUSED TO TAKE MOTORCYCLE OFF ROAD AND CLAIMED THEY HAD NEVER HAD A COMPLAINT OF MOTORCYCLE POWERING DOWN WHILE RIDING.  IT TURNS OUT THEY WEREN'T BEING HONEST -THE SAME MODEL OF MY MOTORCYCLE, YEAR 2012 MODEL HAS BEEN RECALLED FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM WHILE MY MODEL YEAR 2011 HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED.  THE MECHANIC AT MY DEALER TOLD ME THAT MANY PEOPLE HAD SAME COMPLAINT,  ZERO WAS LYING AND THE ONLY GOOD PLACE FOR MY MOTO WAS THE GARBAGE. THEY TRIED TO FIX MY BIKE BUT IT STILL POWERS DOWN AFTER APPROXIMATELY 9 MILES AND LEAVES ME STRANDED (AVG ON THIS BIKE IS LISTED AT 43 MILES BEFORE NEEDING RECHARGE). THIS BIKE AND THE OTHER 2011 MODEL S NEED TO BE RECALLED COMPLETELY SINCE ZERO CAN'T FIX THE PROBLEM ALL 2011 S MODEL RIDERS ARE ALL AT RISK. PLEASE REFERENCE THE RECALL OF 2012 MOTORCYCLE HTTP://WWW-ODI.NHTSA.DOT.GOV/ACMS/CS/JAXRS/DOWNLOAD/DOC/UCM427143/RCAK-12V455-9849.PDF    THANK YOU  *TR",
