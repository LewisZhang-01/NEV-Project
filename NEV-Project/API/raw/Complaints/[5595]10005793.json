FOUND OUT IT IS A BLOWN HEAD GASKET.  DEALER ESTIMATES $2500 REPAIR.  (SINGLE MOM, CAN'T AFFORD IT) FOUND OUT THROUGH RESEARCH AND MECHANICS THAT NEONS ARE PRONE TO BLOWN HEAD GASKETS BETWEEN 30 TO 60 THOUSAND MILES.  MECHANIC EXPLAINED THAT THE GASKETS CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS WITHIN THE METALS ARE NOT COMPATIBLE.  BUT THEY ARE NO LONGER USEING THOSE GASKETS AND HAVE REPLACED THEM WITH NEW ONES THAT ARE COMPATIBLE.  I WAS INFORMED THAT ONCE REPLACED THEY HAVE NOT SEEN ANY REOCCURING PROBLEMS.  THIS LEAVES ME WONDERING WHY THE GASKETS HAVE NOT BEEN RECALLED.          THANK YOU  BRANDI",
