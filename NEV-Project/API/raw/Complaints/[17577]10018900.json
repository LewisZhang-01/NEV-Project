IF THIS HAPPENS WHILE DRIVING, VEHICLE CONTROL WILL BE LOST.  A FEW MONTHS AGO I REPLACED THE PASSENGER SIDE STRUT BECAUSE THAT STRUT SPRING BASE FAILED, AT THE TIME I CONSIDERED A FREAK OCCURRENCE AND JUST REPLACED THE STRUT. NOW THAT THE OTHER STRUT IS FAILING I BELIEVE THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND VERY DANGEROUS SAFETY ISSUE. PLEASE CONTACT ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SINCE I NEED MY CAR TO TRAVEL TO WORK AND I AM PLANNING ON TAKING THE CAR TO THE DEALER TOMORROW. *JB",
