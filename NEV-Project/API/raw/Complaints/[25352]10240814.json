HE STATED THAT SPARKS AND SMOKE WERE COMING FROM THE REFRIGERATOR.  THE DEALER STATED THAT THEY WOULD NOT MAKE THE REPAIRS ON THE REFRIGERATOR AND THAT IT WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED AT THE CONTACT'S EXPENSE.  THE MANUFACTURER STATED THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE THE REPAIRS PERFORMED, THE EQUIPMENT MUST BE FULLY OPERATIONAL.  BECAUSE THE CONTACT'S REFRIGERATOR HAD ALREADY FAILED, THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE TO ASSIST.  THE SERIAL, PART, AND RECALL NUMBERS WERE UNKNOWN.",
