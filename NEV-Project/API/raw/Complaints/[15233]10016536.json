DEALER SAID THAT THE 'COMPUTER' INDICATED THAT THERE WAS IMPACT AT SOME POINT AND WARRANTY WOULD NOT COVER. THE ONLY INCIDENT THAT CAR HAS HAD WAS A DENT LAST JANUARY WHEN WE HIT A STREET BUMPER WHICH CAUSED A DENT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE BACK DOOR --VERY BOTTOM. ANYONE CAN TELL THAT DENT HAD BEEN THERE QUITE A WHILE. FURTHERMORE, A DENT THERE SHOULD NOT HAVE CAUSE THE PASSENGER CURTAIN TO DEPLOY. INSURANCE WILL NOT PAY BECAUSE THEY SAY IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT AND THEY ARE RIGHT. VW SAYS THEY STAND BY THEIR COMPUTER AND WON'T REPAIR. HELP PLEASE.   *NLM",
