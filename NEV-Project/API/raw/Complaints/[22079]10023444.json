        "summary": "THE AUTOMATIC TRANSIMISSION HAS BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE THE CAR WAS BOUGHT BRAND NEW IN NOVEMBER OF 1999.  FIRST IS THE EXPERIENCE OF, ON OCCASION THE CAR NOT STARTING WHILE IN PARK. THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED I CALLED CHRYSLER ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE, AND THEY INFORMED ME JUST TO PUT IT IN NUETRAL WHENEVER THAT HAPPENED AND IT WOULD START OK. I HAVE HAD TO DO THAT VERY OFTEN. I ASSUMED IT WAS NOT A BIG DEAL. I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO ENGAGE THE LO 4 WHEEL DRIVE MECHANISM, BUT HAVE NOT HAD THE NEED FOR IT, HENCE NEVER BOTHERED TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT. THIS YEAR THE TRANSMISSION HAS DISENGAGED AT VARIOUS SPEEDS BETWEEN EACH GEAR. IT IS A CONSISTENT PROBLEM, AND HAVE TAKEN CAR TO MECHANIC, HAD LINES CHECKED, TRANSMISSION FLUID CHANGES, ETC., BUT STILL HASN'T RESOLVED THE PROBLEM.   I AM AFRAID THAT IN A CRISIS SITUATION, I WILL HIT THE GAS, AND THE CAR WILL FAIL TO ACCELERATE, OR WILL LUNGE AS A RESULT OF THE ENGINE REVING SO HI BEFORE THE TRANSMISSION RE-ENGAGES. THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM. THE CAR HAS ALL HIGHWAY MILES AND HAS NEVER BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT. I AM SCARED TO DRIVE THIS CAR BECAUSE IT MIGHT RESULT IN AN INJURY.   *NLM",
