        "summary": "I RECIENTLY HAD THE RECALL FOR THE WIPER MOTOR COVER REPAIRED. SINCE THE REPAIR MY WIPERS WILL NOT WORK WHEN THE WEATHER IS BELOW FREEZING. ONCE THE CAR WARMS UP THEY WILL WORK FINE (PROVIDED THE TEMP IS ABOVE 30 DEGREES). I HAVE HAD THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER 3 TIMES TO FIND OUT WHAT IS WRONG, EACH TIME THE WIPERS WILL WORK ONCE THERE, AND NO ACTION IS TAKEN. (MY CAR IS CURRENTLY JUST OVER THE FREE WARRANTY MILEAGE). I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THE WIPERS BEFORE THEY WERE FIXED AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOMTHING DONE. THE WIPERS ACT LIKE THERE MAY BE MOISTURE IN A CONNECTION THAT FREEZES AND PUSHES THE CONNECTION APART, OR INTERFERES WITH ELECTRICAL CONDUCTION, UNTIL THE CAR WARMS SUFFICENTLY TO GET CONDUCTION TO CONTINUE. PLEASE CONTACT ME WITH SOME ANSWERS. THANK YOU.",
