THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED. I HAVE HAD 2 NEW SETS OF REDESIGNED COIL PACKS AND I STILL GET AN ENGINE LIGHT CAUSING THE CAR TO LOSE POWER AND RUN ROUGH, NOT SOMETHING YOU WANT HAPPENING TO YOU WHILE DRIVING 65 MILES A HOUR ON A BUSY HIGHWAY.  I WISH VOLKSWAGEN WOULD ISSUE A RECALL  BEFORE SOMEONE REALLY GETS HURT.   *NLM",
