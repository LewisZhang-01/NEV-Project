THE ONES INSTALLED IN THE SECOND AND THIRD ROW SEATING ARE DEFECTIVE.  IN OUR VEHICLE THIS IS MAINLY THE SHOULDER BELTS.  THEY WILL NOT RELEASE FROM THE CASING SO THAT THE CHILDREN CAN BUCKLE UP.  THEY ARE ALWAYS JAMMED.  I HAVE CHECKED THEM ON MANY OCCASIONS.  I DO NOT FIND THEM TWISTED, THEY LOOK NORMAL BUT WILL NOT OPERATE.  *JB",
