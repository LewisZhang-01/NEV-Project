        "summary": "I WAS HEADED HOME GOING DOWN A CITY STREET HEADED TO THE HIGHWAY, WHEN I HERD A LOUD NOISE AND FELT A JOLT FROM MY 14' TANDEM AXLE ENCLOSED TRAILER.  I LOOKED BACK AND NOTICED THAT THE TRAILER WAS RIDING LOWER THAN NORMAL.  I PULLED INTO A GAS STATION AND WHEN I GOT OUT TO LOOK I NOTICED THAT THE TRAILER BALL WAS ABOUT 2\" OFF THE GROUND.  I LOOKED UNDER MY  TRUCK AND NOTICED THAT THE RECEIVER HITCH HAD BROKEN.  ONLY 2 OF THE 6 BOLTS WERE HOLDING  IT UP, AND THE MIDDLE BOLT ON THE LEFT SIDE HADE COMPLETELY BROKE.  I REMOVED THE BALL AND PUT IT ON THE BUMPER TO TOW THE TRAILER HOME.  I TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE DEALER THE NEXT MONDAY BECAUSE I WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAD A RECALL ON THE HITCHES.  THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE HITCH WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, AND THAT MY MODEL TRUCK DIDN'T HAVE ANY RECALLS.  THEY GAVE ME THE PHONE NUMBER TO THE FACTORY FOR COMPLAINTS. I HAD TO PURCHASE ANOTHER HITCH FROM ANOTHER DEALER. WHEN I GOT HOME TO PUT IT ON, I NOTICED THAT THE NEW HITCH HAD 8 BOLTS INSTEAD OF 6.SOMEONE MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT THE OLD HITCHES WERE DEFECTIVE. I CALLED THE FACTORY  THE NEXT DAY AND THEY TOLD ME THE SAME THING THAT THE DEALER HAD.  I ASKED FOR THE NUMBER TO THE FACTORY AREA REP. AND WAS TOLD THAT THE DEALER WOULD HAVE TO CONTACT THEM.. I CALLED THE DEALER BACK, AND TALKED TO THE SERVICE MANAGER.  HE SAID THAT HE HAD ALREADY CALLED FOR THE REP. AND LEFT A MESSAGE FOR HIM TO CALL.  NO RESPONSE. I TOLD THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT THEY NEEDED TO HAVE A RECALL ON THIS HITCH, BECAUSE IF I WOULD HAVE MADE IT TO THE HIGHWAY,AT 65 MPH,  THE HITCH COULD HAVE BROKEN ALL THE WAY, AND WITH THE SAFTY CHAINS ATTACHED TO THE HITCH, THE TRAILER WOULD HAVE BEEN ON ITS OWN AND COULD HAVE KILLED PEOPLE.  I STILL HAVE HAD NO CALL BACKS. I HAVE PICTURES OF THE OLD HITCH ON MY TRUCK BEFORE I REMOVED IT.",
