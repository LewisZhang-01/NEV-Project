ON FOUR OCCASIONS DURING THAT TIME, I CUT MY LOWER LEFT LEG RATHER SEVERELY (ENOUGH TO PRODUCE RUNNING BLOOD) ON THE CAR DOOR. UPON CLOSELY EXAMINING THE DOOR, IT IS CLEAR THAT THE LOWER PORTION OF IT PROTRUDES SEVERAL INCHES INWARD IN A SHARPLY CURVED FASHION WITH A VERY POINTED TIP. THE DOOR WAS NOT DAMAGED IN ANY WAY, AND IT OPENED AND CLOSED AS INTENDED. IT IS UNREALISTIC TO THINK THAT IN 22 YEARS OF DRIVING, THAT I WOULD ALL OF A SUDDEN NOT KNOW HOW TO ENTER OR EXIT AN AUTOMOBILE. I'VE RENTED MERCURY SABLES ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS OVER PREVIOUS YEARS, AND HAVE NEVER HAD THAT PROBLEM BEFORE IN MY LIFE. I REPORT THAT THE CAR IS A 2002 MODEL, BUT IT MAY BE A 2003 MODEL. IT IS MY PERSONAL OPINION THAT THE MATTER WARRANTS SOME INVESTIGATION IN ORDER TO PREVENT FUTURE INJURIES. *PH  *JB    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**768041",
