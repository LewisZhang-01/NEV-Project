NOW SHE HIT THE VEHICLE STRAIGHT ON AND IF I'M RIGHT ANYTHING ABOVE 25 OR MORE THE AIRBAGS SHOULD DEPLOY.  LUCKLY MY WIFE WASN'T INJURED BUT SHE COULD HAVE BEEN BADLY INJURED.  I CALLED THE COMPANY AND ALL THEY TOLD ME WAS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CALLED THEN IMMEDIATELY BUT WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.  I WANTED TO FILE A COMPLAINT ON THE DEFECT AIRBAGS.  THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED AND CHRYSLER SAID THE SHOULD 'VE BEEN NOTIFIED SO THEY COULD INSPECT THE VEHICLE BUT THE INSURANCE COMPANY TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE BODY SHOP RIGHT AWAY AND THEY STARTED TO REPAIR IT WHILE MY WIFE WAS AT WORK.  THERE WAS $5,400 IN DAMAGE TO THE FRONT END, BASICALLY IT WAS COMPLETELY REPLACED BUT THE AIRBAGS NEVER WENT OFF IS WHAT HAS ME STUMPED. IT'S A 2002 PT CRUISER",
