AUDI REFUSES TO REPLACE ALL OF THE COIL PACKS AT ONCE, INSTEAD PREFERING TO HAVE THE CUSTOMER COME IN FOR EACH INEVITABLE FAILURE. THE CAR IS ESSENTIALY INOPERABLE IN THIS CONDITION AND REQUIRES TOWING FOR EACH INSTANCE OF FAILURE WHICH DOES NOT OCCURE LOCALLY. AUDI NEEDS TO RECALL THIS CAR!       I WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER THE PLIGHT OF HANDICAPPED INDIVIDUALS FOR WHOM THIS IS MORE THAN A MAJOR INCONVENIENCE, BUT A DANGEROUS SITUATION. AUDI KNOWS ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND COULD ADDRESS IT DIRECTLY INSTEAD OF PUTTING PEOPLE THROUGH THIS.  THANK YOU",
