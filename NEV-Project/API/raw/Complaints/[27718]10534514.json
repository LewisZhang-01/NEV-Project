        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING MY 2003 HONDA ACCORD V6 COUPE, AT AROUND 55 MPH, THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY DROPPED TO ABOUT 20 MPH.  THE RPM'S JUMPED TO 7000.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND \"MAINTENANCE\" LIGHTS CAME ON.  AFTER NEARLY BEING REAR-ENDED BY THE VEHICLE BEHIND ME ( RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC), I PULLED OVER AND TURNED THE CAR OFF.  AFTER WAITING SEVERAL MINUTES, I TURNED IT BACK ON AND DROVE HOME, NEVER GOING ABOVE 20 MPH.  WHEN I FINALLY GOT THE CAR TOWED TO LANDMARK HONDA (ALEXANDRIA, VA) I WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD NEED A REMANUFACTURED TRANSMISSION AT THE COST OF $5085, PARTS AND LABOR.  GRANTED, THE VEHICLE IS 10 YEARS OLD WITH 90K MILES, I WAS A LITTLE DISHEARTEN.  I WAS ABLE TO FIND A TRANSMISSION SPECIALIST IN THE AREA WHERE THEY ARE REBUILDING THE TRANSMISSION FOR $2800.  I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN HONDA AND ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR REPUTATION FOR DEPENDABILITY. I STRONGLY FEEL THAT HONDA IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND NEEDS TO RECTIFY THE ISSUE AND COMPENSATE ALL HONDA OWNERS WHO HAVE HAD THIS SIMILAR ISSUE.  *TR",
