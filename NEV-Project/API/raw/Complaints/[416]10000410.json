I HAVE HAD IT SERVICED BUT APPARENTLY THE TOYOTA ENGINES HAVE AN OIL SLUDGE BUILD UP PROBLEM WHICH DESTROYS THE ENGINE IF IT OCCURS.  TOYOTA IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS JUNCTURE IF THEY ARE GOING TO REPAIR THE ENGINE WHICH IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.  I HAD IT SERVICED ON 11/20/02 AT MAGIC TOYOTA.  FOUR WEEKS LATER THE ENGINE IS DEAD LINED WITH BLUE SMOKE, POOR COMPRESSION, AND A KNOCK.  I HAVE RECENTLY READ THAT TOYOTA ENGINES FROM 2000 ON WERE HAVING THIS PROBLEM.  I AM ALSO UNDERSTANDING THAT THE STATE OF IDAHO AND POSSIBLY CALIFORNIA ARE FORMULATING A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ON THIS ISSUE.  TOYOTA IS CLAIMING THAT IT IS AN OWNER MAINTENANCE ISSUE NOT A DEFECT.  I REQUEST TO FILE AN OFFICIAL COMPLAINT AGAINST TOYOTA IN REFERENCE TO THIS ENGINE DEFECT.  THEY ARE NOT STANDING GOOD FOR IT.  AN ENGINE WITH 20,000 MILES ON IT SHOULD NOT BE DEAD LINED.   TS",
