        "summary": "I HAVE MECHANICAL EXPERIENCE AND MAINTAIN MY VEHICLES RELIGIOUSLY AS I LIKE TO KEEP THEM AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.  WE HAVE A '99 FORD WINDSTAR AND AT 30,800 MILES THE TRANSMISSION GAVE OUT AS MY WIFE WAS DRIVING THROUGH A BUSY INTERSECTION.  SHE DESCRIBED IT AS A LOUD \"BANG\" AND THEN IT WOULD NOT GO ANY FURTHER.  AFTER HAVING IT TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY ADVISED WE HAD WORN OUT THE \"CLUTCHES\" AND THE TRANSMISION NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  I HAD JUST DRIVEN THE VEHICLE ON A SKI TRIP VACATION THE WEEK BEFORE AND THE TRANSMISSION DID NOT SLIP OR HAVE ANY PROBLEMS, SOMETHING INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION BROKE WITHOUT ANY PRIOR WARNING AND LEFT MY WIFE AND KIDS STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY INTERSECTION.  AFTER RESEARCHING ON THE WEB AND VERIFYING THROUGH SOME CONNECTIONS I FOUND THAT THIS IS A CONSISTENT PROBLEM WITH THESE TRANSMISSIONS AND IT USUALLY OCCURS BETWEEN 30K TO 50K MILES.  THE DEALERSHIP TRIED TO MAKE US PAY SINCE IT WAS 800 MILES OVER THE WARRANTY BUT AFTER MUCH DELIBERATION THEY AGREED TO \"LET\" US PURCHASE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY AND GAVE US A REBUILT TRANSMISION.  WE HAD THE VEHICLE IN SEVERAL TIMES PREVIOUSLY FOR TRANSMISSION RECALLS AND PERFORMANCE ISSUES.  WE NEVER TOW ANYTHING WITH OUR VAN AND MY WIFE MAINLY DRIVES AROUND THE AREA TO WORK AND TRANSPORTING OUR CHILDREN.  WHERE MY WIFE WAS STRANDED WAS ON TOP OF A HILL IN THE MIDDLE OF A 6 LANE HIGHWAY INTERSECTION AND NOT ONLY DO I FEEL THIS IS A QUALITY ISSUE PERPETUATED ON FORD CUSTOMERS BUT A SAFETY ISSUE ALSO AS WAS DEMONSTRATED AT THIS TIME.",
