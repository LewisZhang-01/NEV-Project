        "summary": "I HAVE A 1997 TOYOTA T-100 4X4 EXTENDED CAB PICKUP TRUCK. THE CENTER DRAG LINK IN THE STEERING FAILED. I AM A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL STRUCTURAL ENGINEER AND HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF METAL FATIQUE, FABRICATION DEFECTS, ETC. THE CASTING APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN DEFECTIVE. THIS COMPONENT HAS NEVER BEEN ABNORMALLY STRESSED TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE.     THE RESULT OF THE FAILURE LEFT THE STEERING WHEEL TURNING FREELY WITHOUT CHANGING THE DIRECTION THAT THE WHEELS WERE POINTED. THE FAILURE ACTUALLY OCCURRED IN A PARKING LOT, THEREFORE THERE WAS NOT ADDITIONAL DAMAGE. IF THE FAILURE HAD OCCURED MINUTES EARLIER I WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE INTERSTATE TRAVELING AT SPEED. THIS COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN THE CAUSE OF A CATASTROPHIC ACCIDENT. FORTUNATELY, THERE WAS NO RELATED ACCIDENT.     I TOOK THE VEHICLE DIRECTLY TO THE DEALER. I HAVE PHOTOS OF THE FAILURE THAT WERE TAKEN BY THE DEALER. THE PHOTOS ARE DIGITAL AND ARE SUCH THAT THEY CAN BE EMAILED.",
