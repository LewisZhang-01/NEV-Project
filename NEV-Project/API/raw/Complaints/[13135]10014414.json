I HAVE SEEN ALL THE COMPLAINTS AND I AM NOT THE ONLY GRAND AM OWNER WITH THIS ISSUE. THE DEALER  SAID IT WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY BEFORE AND NOT UNDER WARRANTY NOW, SO I HAD TO PAY. I CAN NOT AFFORD TO REPLACE THE ROTORS EVERY 10000 MILES. I BELIEVE THIS IS A DEFECT IN THE DESIGN OF THESE ROTORS.  NEVER HAD ANY OTHER CAR DO THIS.  DEALER SAID MY PROBLEM.   WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER PONTIAC.  *JB",
