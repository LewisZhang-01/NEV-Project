THE CONTACT STATED THAT ONCE THE CAP WAS RELEASE AND THE ENGINE WAS TURNED OFF, THE FUEL SPILL COULD BE STOPPED. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER WHO DIAGNOSED THAT THE RETURN VALVE WAS STUCK BETWEEN THE TANKS, WHICH CAUSED FUEL TO ENTER THE SECOND TANK AND OVERFLOW. AS A RESULT THE FUEL PUMP FAILURE, THE JUMPER AND THE ROLL-OVER VALVES NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE WHO DID NOT OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS NOT INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER: 93V125000 (FUEL SYSTEM, GASOLINE:STORAGE:TANK ASSEMBLY). THE VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED. THE FAILURE AND THE CURRENT MILEAGE WAS 116,105.",
