AFTER DIAGNOSIS, TOLD THERE WAS A ENCODER MOTOR FAILURE AND THE MOTOR HAD TO BE REPLACED.  MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT CHERVROLET POINT OF CONTACT TO DISCUSS IF THIS SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER WARRANTY SINCE THE 4-WHEEL DRIVE WAS HARDLY USED AND THE PART IS PROBABLY DEFECTIVE.  HOWEVER, NO RESPONSE AS OF YET.  THE COST IS $600 FOR THE REPAIR.  THE CAR HAD ONLY 45,000 MILES AT THE TIME.  PRIOR TO THAT, THE LIGHT ON THE 4-WHEEL BUTTON WOULD BE LIT DURING SWITCHING BUT NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN.  DOING A SEARCH ON THE INTERNET RESULTED IN SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE ENCODER.",
