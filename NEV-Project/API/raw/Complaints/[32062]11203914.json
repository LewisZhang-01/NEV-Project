THEN TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, AFTER FIGHTING WITH AUDI CARE FOR THE LAST MONTH THEY ONLY AGREED TO REIMBURSE US $200 OUT OF A $525 TOW BILL BECAUSE WE DIDN'T CALL THEM TO SCHEDULE THE TOW. WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT SERVICE EXISTED AND AT 12:45 AM WITH A CAR THAT JUST DIED AND WAS IN THE ROAD, WE JUST WANTED TO CONTACT THE CLOSEST PLACE AND GET OUR CAR OFF THE ROAD AS WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT OUR SAFETY AND GETTING HIT BY ANOTHER VEHICLE.",
