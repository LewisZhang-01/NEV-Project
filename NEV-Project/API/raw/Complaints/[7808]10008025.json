I HAVE NEVER HAD A RIM LEAK AIR ON ANY OTHER CAR THAT I HAVE OWNED AND WAS QUITE AGRIVATED TO LEARN FROM THE WHEEL SHOP OWNER THAT HE HAS DONE AROUND 30 SUCH REPLACEMENTS THIS YEAR. ALL ON FORD WINDSTARS. NO OTHER MANUFACTURE OR MODEL. I REALIZE THAT THE 1995 WINDSTAR WAS THE WORST YEAR FOR FORD WINDSTARS, BUT AFTER HAVING TO PUT UP WITH HEADGASKET BLOWOUTS AT 58,000 MILES, TRANSMISSION BLOWOUTS AT 70,000 AND ASSORTED OTHER ELECTRICAL FAILURES, THE WHEELS SEEM ANOTHER REDICULOUS MANUFACTURING BLUNDER THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY THE BRUNT OF. THEY ARE DEALER ONLY PART AND $90+ A PIECE. I HAVE NOW REPLACED 2. THE FIRST TIME, A FEW YEARS AGO, WHEN THIS HAPPENED, THE DEALER HAD TO SPECIAL ORDER THE PART. NOW THEY CARRY THEM IN STOCK. (I WONDER WHY???)",
