ONE DAY, UPON OPENING MY TRUNK TO PLACE GROCERIES IN IT, THE TRUNK SLAMMED DOWN ON THE BACK OF MY HEAD AND NECK WHILE BENDING OVER TO PUT SOME ITEMS DEEP INTO IT.  THE TRUNK SLAMMED DOWN WITH SUCH FORCE THAT I ENDED UP WITH A CONCUSSION AND BRUISED SPINE PER 2 DOCTORS THAT EXAMINED ME AFTERWARDS.   THE 2 SUPPORTING TRUNK GAS LIFTS WERE WORN, HOWEVER, THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE PRODUCED A FORCE GREAT ENOUGH TO CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR HARM WHEN THE TRUNK IS IN THE FULLY OPEN POSITION.  I FEEL THAT THIS IS AN ENGINEERING SAFETY DEFECT ON THE PART OF INFINITI/NISSAN AND SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE TO RECTIFY THIS HORRIBLE SAFETY PROBLEM.  THIS TRUNK SHOULD BE CONSIDERED HAZARDOUS.   *NLM    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
