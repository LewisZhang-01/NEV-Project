AFTER TWO DAYS OF FIGHTING WITH THE DEALER, THEY REPLACED THE WINDSHIELD.  THREE DAYS AGO, WITH APPROX. 2000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE, IT CRACKED AGAIN.  AGAIN, WE DID NOT HIT ANYTHING.  THE DEALER WILL NOT REPLACE IT.  THERE HAS TO BE AN ISSUE WITH THIS VEHICLE.  I'M AN ENGINEER, AND HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR 35 YEARS.  I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THIS.",
