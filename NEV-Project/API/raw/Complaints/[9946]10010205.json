THE INCIDENT HAPPENED WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND RESEMBLED A TEAR ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WAY UP THE WINDOW.  IT DID NOT RESEMBLE AN EXTERNAL DAMAGE SIGHT AND SEEMED TO LOOK AS IF THE WINDOW RIPPED OPEN FOR SOME REASON.  THE INITIAL 'TEAR' WAS ABOUT A FOOT LONG AND EXPANDED THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE WINDOW FROM THERE.  I WAS QUICKLY REFERRED TO MY INSURANCE CARRIER BY THE DEALERSHIP.  I WAS ON MY WAY THERE AND WAS LESS THEN A MILE FROM THEM WHEN THIS OCCURRED.*JB",
