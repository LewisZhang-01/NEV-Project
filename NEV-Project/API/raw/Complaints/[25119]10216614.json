        "summary": "I HAVE A 2002 DODGE DURANGO.  I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AROUND 12/20/07.  AROUND 1/5/08 I NOTICED THAT THE VEHICLE COULD BE SHIFTED OUT OF PARK WITH OUT THE KEY IN THE IGNITION OR THE BRAKE BEING PRESSED.  THIS IS AN OBVIOUS SAFETY CONCERN AS IT COULD EASILY SLIP OUT OF PARK OR IF THERE IS A CHILD IN THE CAR THEY COULD HIT IT OUT OF PARK.  I DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE PROBLEM AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS EXACT PROBLEM ON 01-02 DODGE DURANGOS AND DAKOTAS.  I THEN GOT IN CONTACT WITH A DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THE RECALL WORK DONE AND THEY SAID THAT MY VIN NUMBER WAS NOT UNDER THE RECALL AND THAT I HAD TO CALL CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I CALLED THEM AND THEY TO TOLD ME MY VEHICLE WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE RECALL AND THAT THEY WOULD NOT FIX IT.  I FEEL THAT MY CAR SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY BECAUSE I AM EXPERIENCING THE EXACT THING THEY WERE RECALLED FOR AND HAVE THE SAME YEAR AND MAKE OF THE RECALL.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE IS ANY WAY YOU CAN HELP ME.   *TR",
