A SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE AT JAY MARKS MAZDA IN HOUSTON, TEXAS ADVISED ME THAT MAZDA DID S NOT CALL FOR A SERVICING OF THE TRANSMISSION.  SOMEWHERE AROUND 52,000 MILES THE TRANSMISSION BEGAN TO DOWN SHIFTING PRETTY ROUGHLY.  I HAD THE FLUID CHANGED, WHICH DID NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.  I PHONED THE HOUSTON AREA CORPORATE OFFICE AND NEVER RECEIVED A RETURN CALL.  AT 63,300 MILES WHILE ON THE INTERSTATE AND CHANGING LANES, THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT.  THERE WAS FLUID SPEWING OUT FROM THE OVERFLOW HOSE UNDERNEATH THE HOOD.  THIS CAUSED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SMOKE, WHICH I FEARED WAS ABOUT TO CATCH A FIRE.  I WAS TOLD THAT MAZDA IS USING ALUMINUM HOUSING FOR THE PISTONS, WHICH IS NOT HOLDING UP.  I FEEL THAT THE CHEAPER COST IS PUTTING INDIVIDUALS'' LIVES AT STAKE.",
