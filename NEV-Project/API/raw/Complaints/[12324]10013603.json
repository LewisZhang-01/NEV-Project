        "summary": "ENGINE NOISE WHEN COLD.  SOUNDS LIKE A LIFTER IS STICKING.  IT DISAPATES WHEN THE ENGINE WARMS UP, HOWEVER, CAN LAST UP TO 15 MINUTES OR LONGER DEPENDING OH HOW COLD THE ENGINE WAS WHEN STARTED.  WHEN I DROVE THIS VEHICLE TO THE DEALER FOR ITS 30000 SERVICE, I THOUGHT A ROD WAS GOING TO SHOOT THROUGH THE ENGINE WALL..IT WAS THAT NOISY.  IT LASTED AT LEAST 10 MILES OF DRIVING UNTIL THE NOISE DISAPATED.  THIS AUTO WAS PURCHASED BY MY MOTHER IN LAW (NOW DECEASED), IS IN HER ESTATE  AND HAS TWO MONTHS BEFORE WARRANTY EXPIRES.  THE DEALER WILL NOT REPAIR DUE TO ALLEGED SUBARU BULLETIN. SUBARU OF AMERICA SAYS IT IS NORMAL, WILL NOT CAUSE A PROBLEM OVER THE LIFE OF THE ENGINE, HOWEVER CLAIMS THEY HAVE NOT PRODUCED NOR WILL PRODUCE A SUBARU BULLETIN ON THIS ISSUE.  THIS IS NOT A NORMAL OPERATING NOISE AND IT WILL NO DOUBT DAMAGE THE ENGINE OVER TIME.  I WOULD NOT BUY THIS CAR WITH THIS SOUND AND WOULD NOT EXPECT ANYONE INCLUDING ANY SUBARU DEALER OR SUBARU OF AMERICA TO PURCHASE WITH THIS ENGINE NOISE, LET ALONE TRY TO SELL ONE IN THIS CONDITION.  IN MY MIND IT IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT AND A RESPONSIBILITY OF SUBARU TO FIX.  THIS IS A PROBLEM SUBARU NEEDS TO STEP UP AND TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR AN INFERIOR ENGINE DESIGN.  OR POST A WARNING ON EVERY CAR WARNING POTENTIAL BUYERS THAT THEIR CAR MAY DEVELOP AN ENGINE NOISE DUE TO ENGINE DESIGN, THAT WILL EFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO SELL THE CAR AT A LATER DATE. *JB",
