        "summary": "PURCHASED A NEW RANGER XLT EXTENDED CAB DEC. 20 2002. WHILE TRYING DIAGNOSE WHY THE DOOR AJAR SYSTEM WAS MALFUNCTIONING, I NOTICED THAT THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR WAS NOT STRAIGHT. IT HAS SINCE BECOME A PROBLEM WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND TAKING RIGHT HAND TURNS, WHERE AIR CAN BE HEARD THROUGH THE DOOR OPENING. THE SERVICE MANAGER WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE STATED THAT IT WAS JUST THAT THERE IS A DIFFERENT SOUND WHEN TURNING BECAUSE THE AIR TRAVELS A DIFFERENT PATH ACROSS THE TRUCK BODY. HE HAS NOT TESTED THE ISSUE ON THE HIGHWAY BECAUSE WE WERE PRESSED FOR TIME. THE SERVICE MANAGER AND AUTO BODY MANAGER DID AGREE THAT THE DOOR WAS NOT STRAIGHT ALONG THE FRONT AND TOP EDGES AND AGREED TO PERFORM A REPAIR AND INSTALL A NEW DOOR FROM THE FACTORY. THE PROBLEM THERE WAS THAT I WAS TOLD THAT A DOOR INSTALLED AS A \"REPAIR\" WOULD BE PAINTED AT THE DEALERSHIP AND WOULD NOT HAVE THE QUALITY OF A FACTORY INSTALLED DOOR. THE SERVICE MANAGER ALSO STATED THAT HE COULD NOT GUARANTEE THAT A \"NEW\" DOOR WOULD FIT ANY BETTER. I ADMIRE HIM FOR HIS HONESTY TO THE END.   I PAID FOR A NEW VEHICLE, NOT A SUB-STANDARD REPAIRED VEHICLE, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE PROBLEM EXISTED OFF THE FACTORY FLOOR. THIS ISN'T A WARRANTY REPAIR, BUT A DEFECT. I AM OUTRAGED.",
