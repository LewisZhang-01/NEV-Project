        "summary": "TO WHOM IT MIGHT CONCERN.    MY BMW 540I WAS DIAGNOSED FOR COMPRESSION LOSS BY THE LOCAL BMW AUTHORIZED DEALER.  ACCORDING TO THE DEALER, THE CAUSE IS EXTENDED SULFUR CONTENT USED IN THE US GASOLINE.  THE SULFUR CAUSES A CHEMICAL REACTION WITH THE USED ENGINE BLOCK ALLOY (NIKASIL) AND ERODES PREMATURELY.  CURRENT MILEAGE IS 99'000 MILES.  THIS IS FAR BELOW ANY SERVICE LIFE EXPECTANCY STANDARD FOR A QUALITY MAKE/BRAND CAR (ENGINE).  BMW WANTS TO HOLD THEIR CUSTOMERS RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGE CAUSED BY A DESIGN FLAW.  BMW MISSED TO PROPERLY TEST AND EVALUATE THIS CAR PRIOR TO EXPORTING IT INTO THE US MARKET.  BMW CONFESSES TO THE PROBLEM BY EXTENDING THE ORIGINAL WARRANTY FROM 4 TO 6 YEARS.  I FEEL THAT BMW SHOULD HAVE DONE A TOTAL RECALL ON THIS ISSUE AND NOT JUST A WARRANTY EXTENSION SINCE THE DEFECT IT IS ENTIRELY CAUSED BY BMW'S FAULTY DESIGN.  DO YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THIS ISSUE?  HAS THERE BEEN LEGAL ACTION AGAINST BMW IN THE PAST?  ARE THERE SIMILAR ISSUES WITH OTHER CAR BRANDS/MAKES? ANY ADVICE IN DEALING WITH THIS?    SINCERELY,",
