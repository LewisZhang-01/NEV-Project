IN ADDITION, A LARGE AMOUNT OF WATER WAS TAKEN INTO THE CAB OF THE VEHICLE UNDER THE DOOR SEALS.  I WAS NOT STOPPED IN THE PUDDLE, ONLY MOVED THROUGH IT.  DUE TO THE WATER INCURSION INTO THE CAB OF THE VEHICLE, THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN DECLARED A TOTAL LOSS BY MY INSURANCE.  THEY FEAR ELECTRICAL DAMAGE COULD RESULT.  I AM CONCERNED THAT ANYONE GOING THROUGH STANDING WATER (THIS WAS NOT A HUGE PUDDLE) WOULD FIND THEMSELVES WITH ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS THAT COULD RESULT IN INJURY.  *JB",
