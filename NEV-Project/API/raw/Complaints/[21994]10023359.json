THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE STEERING WHEEL WILL SHAKE WHEN I STEP ON THE BRAKE FROM SPEED >50 MPH.  WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS LESS THAN 36,000 MILES, THE DEALER GRACIOUSLY FIXED THE PROBLEMS WITHOUT CHARGE. LESS THAN A YEAR AGO, I HAD TO FIX THE SAME PROBLEM FOR A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR IT'S >36,000 MILES.  THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT JEEP HAS IMPROVED THE ROTOR DESIGN AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.  BUT NOW I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AGAIN.  MY FRIEND OWNS THE SAME MODEL AND IT HAS THE SAME PROBLEM.  I CALLED JEEP BUT WAS TOLD THAT IT'S NOT A DEFECT.  SO, AS A CONSUMER, AM I SUPPOSED TO FIX THE ROTOR ONCE EVERY 9 MONTHS? MY OTHER VEHICLES DO NOT HAVE THAT PROBLEM.   *NLM",
