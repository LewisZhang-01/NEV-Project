THE ISSUE IS WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A ZERO RPM (STOP LIGHT) SCENARIO, THE VEHICLES RPMS GO UP HIGH,  BUT THE THE CAR MOVES VERY SLOWLY.  AS IF IT'S NOT IN SYNC WITH THE GAS PEDAL WHEN BEING PRESSED.   TRANSMISSION FAILURE HAS BEEN TESTED AND NOT NOTED.  DUE TO THE INTERMITTENT NATURE OF THE PROBLEM, WE HAVE TAKEN DRASTIC MEASURES, SUCH AS INSTALLING A REMOTE START TO BRING VEHICLE TO TEMPERATURE BEFORE DRIVING.  THIS COULD BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IF THE CUT OUT OF THE ACCELERATION HAPPENS WHEN MERGING ONTO A HIGHWAY OR CAUSING REAR IMPACT TO UNSUSPECTING DRIVERS.  CAR HAS BEEN INSPECTED AT LOCAL DEALER, WHERE THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO REPLICATE THE ISSUE, BUT I WANT THIS DOCUMENTED SHALL ANY ACCIDENT EVER OCCUR DUE TO SPEED CONTROL FAILURE.",
