VW SERVICED THE CAR UNDER WARRANTY AND REPLACED THE FAULTY IGNITION COIL. MY RESEARCH OF THE ISSUE ONLINE, HOWEVER, IMPLIES THAT THE REMAINING  ORIGINAL IGNITION COILS IN THE ENGINE ARE ALSO LIKELY TO FAIL AND VW WILL NOT REPLACE THEM UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY FAIL. (HTTP://WWW.AUTOWEEK.COM/SEARCH/SEARCH_DISPLAY.MV?PORT_CODE=AUTOWEEK&CAT_CARNEWS&CONTENT_CODE=08716829&SEARCH_TYPESTD&SEARCH_ID=897428&RECORD=1).  CONSIDERING THIS IIS A KNOWN VULNERABILITY THAT HAS OCCURRED IN A GREAT NUMBER OF THESE CARS, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE CAR RECALLED FOR A MORE PERMANENT FIX. *PH    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**770838",
