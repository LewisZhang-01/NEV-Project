        "summary": "I OWN A 96 SATURN SC2.  I PURCHASED IT IN APRIL OF 2000, WITH 43,000 MILES ON THE ODOMETER.  SINCE THEN, I HAVE DRIVEN APPROXIMATELY 23,000 MILES, NOTICING A SIGNIFICANT OIL CONSUMPTION ISSUE.  WHEN ON THE HIGHWAY, IT WILL USE APPROXIMATELY A QUART EVERY 500 MILES.  AROUND TOWN, I CAN SQUEEZE OUT MORE, AROUND NEEDING ONE QUART EVERY 1,000 MILES.  I HAVE HEARD COMPLAINTS FROM OTHERS, AND FEEL THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.  I MYSELF WORK ON CARS ALL THE TIME AND KNOW TO CHECK AND ADD OIL (MUCH CHEAPER THAN AN OVERHAUL).  HOWEVER, FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO DON'T DO SO AND ONLY CHANGE OIL EVERY 3,000 MILES MAY WELL END UP STRANDED.  THIS SEEMS TO DEFINITELY BE A RECURRING SAFETY ISSUE WITH SATURN THAT NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH IMMEDIATELY.  THANK YOU. TS",
