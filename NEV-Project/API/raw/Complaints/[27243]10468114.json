        "summary": "I BOUGHT THIS CAR BRAND NEW IN 2001 FROM A HONDA DEALERSHIP. A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER, THE TRANSMISSION HAD FAILED. I CALLED THE HONDA DEALERSHIP WHERE I HAD BOUGHT THE CAR AND THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THIS GENERATION HAD A KNOWN TRANSMISSION DEFECT. THEY REPAIRED MY CAR FOR FREE BECAUSE IT WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY AT THE TIME AND I WAS TOLD THAT THE TRANSMISSION NOW HAD AN EXTENDED 7YEAR/109,000MILE WARRANTY.  ON JULY 15TH, 2012,  I WAS DRIVING ON HIGHWAY 101S AT 65MPH WHEN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT SUDDENLY CAME ON. I NOTICED A SLIGHT LOSS IN POWER, BUT MY CAR DID NOT DIE OUT. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STAYED ON. THE NEXT DAY, I DECIDED TO TEST DRIVE THE CAR AGAIN TO SEE IF THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS A ONE TIME OCCURRENCE. I STARTED UP THE CAR, PUT IT IN REVERSE, AND THEN TO DRIVE. THERE WAS A SUDDEN DELAYED JERK FROM REVERSE TO DRIVE. I MANAGED TO PLUG IN A CODE READER INTO THE CAR'S COMPUTER PORT AND PULLED UP TWO CODES: P0700 AND P0740. BOTH OF THESE CODES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSMISSION. NOT AGAIN?!?!  MY CAR HAS NOW EXCEEDED THE EXTENDED WARRANTY AND I AM AFRAID THAT HONDA WILL NOT COVER THE REPAIRS. I READ ON SEVERAL FORUMS THAT THIS HAS ALSO OCCURRED TO HONDA OWNERS WHERE THE DEALERSHIP HAS REFUSED TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE DUE TO THE EXPIRED EXTENDED WARRANTY COVERAGE.  *TR",
