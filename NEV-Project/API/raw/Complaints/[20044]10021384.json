THE NOTICE SAID THAT IF I HAD ALREADY HAD THE CLOCK SPRING REPLACED ( I HAD), THAT I SHOULD SUBMIT THE REQUESTED INFORMATION AND THEY WOULD PAY ME BACK. I SENT THIS INFORMATION ON JANUARY 12, 2003 TO THE ADDRESS ON THE RECALL NOTICE. THE REPAIR COST $142.22.I HEARD NOTHING UNTI  APRIL 4, 2003, WHEN I RECEIVED A LETTER ASKING FOR THE SAME COPIES I HAD SUBMITTED IN JANUARY. I RESENT THEM, AND HAVE HEARD NOTHING SINCE. IT HAS NOW BEEN SIX MONTHS SINCE I RECEIVED THE ORIGINAL NOTICE FROM CHRYSLER (REFERENCE # 10925018-VR102141-B24) AND STILL HAVE NO REIMBURSEMENT.   IT APPEARS CHRYSLER HAS NO INTENTION OF COMPLYING WITH THE INFORMATION IN THEIR RECALL NOTICE. WHAT SHOULD I DO?*AK",
