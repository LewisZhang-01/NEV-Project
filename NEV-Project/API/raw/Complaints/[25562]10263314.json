OUT OF THE BLUE I AM STRANDED IN A PARKING LOT DUE THE CAR NOT WANTING TO START.  I HAD 3/4 OF A TANK OF GAS, YET IT ACTED LIKE THERE WAS NONE.  HAD CAR TOWED TO DEALERSHIP.  WOULD NOT START OFF OF TOW TRUCK.  NEXT DAY, STARTS FINE.  IT HAS TAKEN 3 DAYS FOR THEM TO FINALLY CONCLUDE IT'S THE FUEL PUMP!  FIX = +$950.00!!!!   I HAVE 34,000 MILES!!!!  WE HAVE HAD VEHICLES MUCH OLDER THAN MINE AND WITH +100,000 MILES NEVER HAVE THIS PROBLEM.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS!  I AM PARTIALLY DISABLED DUE TO A SEVERE BACK INJURY AND NOW NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IF THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN.  PER PRIOR POSTS, SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN MORE THAN ONCE.  THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT PLACES NOT ONLY THE DRIVER'S LIFE, BUT THAT OF OTHER MOTORISTS.  HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT CHEVY HAS NOT TAKEN ACTION?  SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE! *TR",
