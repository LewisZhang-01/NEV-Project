        "summary": "RANDOM, REPEATED AND SUDDEN BREAKS APPLY; CAR SLOWS DOWN DRAMATICALLY. VSA LIGHT MAY COME ON, MAY NOT. THIS OCCURRED SEVERAL TIMES. THE FIRST TIME IT OCCURRED WAS ON A TRIP TO PA. THE CAR WOULD  SUDDENLY SLOW BY MORE THAN 20 MPH.  WE WERE THROWN HARD INTO OUR SEAT BELTS. WE WENT TO A HONDA DEALERSHIP IN PITTSBURGH.THEY WANTED TO SELL ME 4 NEW TIRES STATING THE PROBLEM WAS DUE TO TIRES NOT WEARING EVEN. THIS WAS HARD FOR US TO BELIEVE. IT WAS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. WE HAD TO VEER OFF THE ROAD  MANY TIMES TO AVOID ACCIDENTS!   GOOGLE SEARCH ON VSA CAR SUDDENLY BREAKING - FIRST 'HIT' WAS A 2013 RECALL ON THE VSA HARNESS AND SENSOR. WE RECEIVED NO INFORMATION ON THE RECALL. HONDA PITTSBURGH FIXED THE RECALL FREE. THEN 8 WEEKS LATER IN MARYLAND THE CAR BEGAN TO DO THE SAME EXACT THING. WE EMERGENCY STOPPED AT A LOCAL AUTO CENTER. THEIR SYSTEM CODE SHOWED FAULTY \"ABS BRAKE SYSTEM\" THEY KINDLY RESET THE CODES, BUT THE CAR CONTINUED TO EXHIBIT SAME. WE THEN WENT TO SALISBURY, MD. HONDA. THEY SAID WE NEEDED A NEW VSA MODULE DESPITE THE DIAGNOSTIC SHOWING NO CODES STATING WE HAD A FAULTY VSA. THE ONLY VSA MODULE WAS IN OHIO AND WOULD TAKE A WEEK TO GET TO MARYLAND, AND COST US $1,710! ALL OTHER VSA MODULES WERE ON BACK ORDER. WE WERE ON VACATION AND COULD NOT STAY AN ADDITIONAL WEEK. NOR DID IT MAKE SENSE TO US TO REPLACE THE VSA MODULE WHEN SALISBURY HONDA SAID IT WAS \"WORKING AS DESIGNED\".  I HAVE A LEGAL FORMAL COMPLAINT REGISTERED WITH HONDA AMERICA. I URGE YOU TO DO THE SAME. WINSTON SALEM, NC  HONDA FEELS IT IS THE YAW SENSOR. HOWEVER, THEY HAVE HAD MY CAR FOR 5 DAYS AND ARE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM OR SHOW A CODE.  I FEEL A RECALL SHOULD NOW BE MADE FOR A YAW SENSOR. BETTER YET, HONDA AMERICA SHOULD REPLACE ALL VSA MODULES FOR FREE BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED!!       .",
