        "summary": "AT 12000 MILES I TOOK MY L200 SATURN IN FOR ROUTINE SERVICE AND WAS INFORMED THAT THE REAR WHEELS WERE OUT OF ALIGNMENT AND THE TIRES (2) WERE CHOPPY. THEY REPLACED THE TIRES AND DID THE ALIGNMENT AT NO CHARGE. I INQUIRED AS TO WHY THIS HAPPENED AND WAS INFORMED THAT IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL SATURN BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT WEIGHTED REAR END OF THE CAR. I AM NOT SURE THAT THIS IS OR IS NOT A SAFETY PROBLEM?? I NOTIFIED SATURN CO AND THEY FILED MY COMPLAINT UNDER REFERENCE # 1-4597347, AND STATED THE MAN MADE COMPONENTS MAY REQUIRE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT. THAT I UNDERSTAND, BUT WHAT I DON'T KNOW IS IF THIS IS A SAFETY PROBLEM. IS ONGOING, AND THAT I MUST ASSUME THE COSTS, OR A PROBLEM THAT REQUIRES A RECALL TO CORRECT THE WHEEL ALIGNMENT PROBLEM? OR COULD THIS RESULT IN A BUY BACK ETC....? PLEASE ADVISE. THANK YOU. WILLIAM SURBROOK. ****DIMS 11 IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****769742.  *AK *JB",
