        "summary": "ON OR ABOUT THE ABOVE DATE OF APRIL 15, 2015 I WASHED MY 2010 TOYOTA CAMRY AT A LOCAL CAR WASH USING THEIR AUTOMATED HIGH PRESSURE WASH AND WAX.  A FEW DAYS AFTERWARD I REALIZED THE CENTER TRUNK AREA, THAT HOLDS THE SPARE TIRE, HELD 2 TO 3 INCHES OF WATER, AND THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE TRUNK ALSO HAD WATER.     I HAVE READ POST AFTER POST ONLINE STATING MANY OTHER TOYOTA OWNERS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM, AND SOME HAVE STATED THE  REAR WINDOW AND BODY PANELS WERE NOT SECURELY SEALED FROM THE OUTSIDE ELEMENTS WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS ASSEMBLED AT THE FACTORY.    IN JUNE OF 2014 WATER WAS GETTING INSIDE ON THE CARPET ON THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE SOAKING THE CARPET COMPLETELY.  THE AIR CONDITIONER CONDENSATION DRAINAGE TUBE HAD PLUGGED UP UNDERNEATH THE VEHICLE THAT CAUSED  THE INTERIOR BY THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE TO BE SOAKED IN WATER.      THERE IS NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER THAT THIS VEHICLE WAS EVER INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT.  THE ODOMETER JUST RECENTLY TURNED OVER 45,145 MILES.  NOW, THERE IS ALREADY AN INDICATION OF MOLD, AND MOLD CAN BE DEADLY.  *TR",
