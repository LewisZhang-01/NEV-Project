        "summary": "2002 CHRYSLER TOWN & COUNTRY HORN  THE HORN ON THE VEHILCLES IS VERY DIFFICULT TO HONK, FOR THE LACK OF A BETTER WORD.  TAPPING THE HORN AS A FRIENDLY GESTURE IS OUT OF THE QUESTION - IN FACT IT IS DISCONCERTING IN THAT YOU REALLY HAVE TO PRESS HARD ON IT TO MAKE IT WORK AND WHEN IT FINALLY WORKS, IT IS QUITE A BLAST (BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE REQUIRED).    THE DEALER SAYS THAT THEY ARE ALL THIS WAY (I CAN'T BE SURE OF THAT)AND THAT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE TENSION OR PART INVOLVED IN THE PROBLEM.    NO VEHICLE I HAVE EVER OWNED HAS EVEN REMOTELY EXHIBITED THIS PROBLEM.  THE FACT IS THAT IT BECOMES A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE ONE HAS TO CONSCIOUSLY THINK ABOUT HOW HARD TO PRESS ON THE HORN TO PRODUCE THE DESIRED RESULTS.  IN THIS CASE, THE ONLY RESULT IS A VERY LOUD AND UNFRIENDLY BLAST.      MANY THANKS,    NICK  707-785-3440    TS",
