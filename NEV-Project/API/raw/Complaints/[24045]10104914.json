THE TRUCK PULLED TO THE RIGHT AND THE REAR END OF THE TRUCK ENDED UP SPINNING AROUND, MAKING A COMPLETE 180--- ON A BRIDGE!! I ENDED UP SLAMMING INTO THE SAFETY RAIL OF THE BRIDGE. AND THE AIR BAGS DIDN'T GO OFF. LUCKILY, I WASN'T INJURED. AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE ACCIDENT WAS MY FAULT, BUT AFTER TALKING TO A FEW OWNERS OF THIS MODEL, I FIGURED OUT THAT MANY OF US HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH THIS TRUCK. THE QUESTION IS, WHY IS THIS PROBLEM NOT BEING FIXED?? I HAVE TALKED TO THE DEALER, AND THEY JUST KEEP REFERRING ME TO DEALERS FROM OTHER TOWNS.    *JB",
