SAID VW WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM. REPLACED FAILED COIL AND HAD VW REP. RESET THE COMPUTER. THEY SAID A VW REP. WAS COMING DOWN AT LEAST 1-2 TIMES PER WEEK BECAUSE OF ALL THE CARS THAT NEEDED RESETS DUE TO THIS PROBLEM. THEY SAID IF THEY DIDN'T RESET THE COMPUTER IT WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. CAR ONLY HAD ABOUT 5,500 MILES ON IT. WAITING FOR OTHER COILS TO FAIL SO I DON'T FEEL SAFE TAKING IT ON LONG TRIPS. I'M HOPING WITH ENOUGH COMPLAINTS AND BAD PUBLICITY, VW WILL BE FORCED INTO A RECALL. DOES ONLY ONE SUPPLIER MANUFACTURE THESE IGNITION COILS?",
