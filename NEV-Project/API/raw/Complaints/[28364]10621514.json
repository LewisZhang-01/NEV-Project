AFTER WAITING A WEEK FOR AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY CLOSEST DEALER AND MORE THAN A HOUR FOR THEM TRYING TO DIAGNOSE THEM PROBLEM.  THEY TELL ME IT IS NOT THE AIRBAG BUT THE CLOCK SPRING AND THAT I OWE THEM $75 DOLLARS TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.  I ASK THEM IF IT IS COVERED AND THEY TELL ME THE PART COSTS APPROXIMATELY $300 OR MORE.  I CHECKED THE COMPUTER IT APPEARS THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM AMONG THIS VEHICLE BUT CHRYSLER JEEP REFUSES TO ADDRESS IT. THERE IS A RECALL FOR IT BUT ONLY IN RIGHT HAND DRIVEN VEHICLES.  BEING THAT I AM A MOTHER OF 4 I AM TERRIFIED TO DRIVE WITH THIS LIGHT ON BUT I CANNOT AFFORD TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.  I REALLY DON'T KNOWN WHAT TO DO.   *TR",
