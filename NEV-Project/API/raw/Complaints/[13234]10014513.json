THIS WAS A SCARY SITUATION BECAUSE HAD THERE BEEN A LOT OF TRAFFIC THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS PERHAPS FATAL ACCIDENT.  THIS IS THE SECOND TIRE TO HAVE BEEN DAMAGE WITHIN TWO WEEKS.  I BELIEVE THE TIRES ARE DEFECTIVE.  I WOULD LIKE AN INVESTIGATION DONE.  I ALSO DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS CAR FOR FEAR OF AN ACCIDENT INVOLVING BAD DEFECTIVE TIRES.  I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY TIRES REPLACED AT NO COST TO ME BECAUSE THE DAMAGE WAS NOT MAY FAULT.  PLEASE HELP ME RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM. *JB",
