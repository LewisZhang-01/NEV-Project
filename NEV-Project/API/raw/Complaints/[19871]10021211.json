I NOTICE THE DASH BOARD ENGINE CHECK  LIGHT ON,  MY WAY TO WORK WHILE DRIVING ON FREEWAY 120(MANTECA,CA.) AND IMMEDIATELY EXITED ON THE FIRST EXIT POINT AND FIND A PARKING SPOT AND CALLED MODESTO MAZDA DEALERSHIP TO INFORMED THEM OF THE SITUATION AND TALK TO CRAIG OSMER AND DENNIS HINKLEY ABOUT IT AND TOLD ME TO CONTINUE MY JOURNEY TO WORK AND DROP THE VEHICLE THE NEXT DAY NOT KNOWING THE CAUSE OF THE ENGINE WARNING LIGHTS ON? SO I WENT AHEAD AND WENT TO MY WORK ON THURSDAY THE 22ND OF MAY,2003. MY CONCERN WAS THAT I COULD HAVE BEEN BLOWN-UP BY THE GAS LEAK IF SPARKS OCCUR AT ANYTIME DURING MY TRAVEL TO AND FROM MY WORK PLACE (MODESTO-FREMONT-MODESTO). I HOPE FOR AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION REGARDING THIS MATTER BEFORE SOMEBODY GETS HURTS DUE TO NEGLIGENCE IN THE PART OF THE VEHICLE MANUFACTURER AND DEALERSHIP ALIKE.  *JB",
