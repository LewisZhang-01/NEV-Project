PLEASE REFER TO CASE #10334297.  TODAY I DROVE A NEW SORENTO AS A TEST-DRIVE AT THE DEALER TO COMPARE MY CAR TO ONE JUST OFF THE ASSEMBLY LINE.  THIS FORM IS TO UPDATE NHTSA THAT THE NEW VEHICLE HAS THE SAME DRIFTING PROBLEM AS THE ONE I PURCHASED IN LATE MARCH 2010.  ALL SPECS FROM EACH ALIGNMENT HAS BEEN FORWARDED TO KIA CORPORATION (MATT IS THE CLIENT SERVICE CONTACT.  MY COMPLAINT NUMBER WITH KIA IS #[XXX]).  ALL ALIGNMENTS ALL DIFFERENT AS TO \"BEFORE ADJUSTMENT AND AFTER ADJUSTMENT\" EVEN THOUGH LESS THAN 3 MONTHS HAS GONE BY FOR ALL THE ADJUSTMENTS MADE.  THIS APPEARS TO BE A DESIGN FLAW AND AT THIS TIME DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE \"FIXABLE\".  FELT THIS PROBLEM SHOULD BE REPORTED.  INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6). *TR",
