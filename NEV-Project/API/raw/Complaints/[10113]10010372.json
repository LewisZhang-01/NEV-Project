ALSO, THE CAR IS BEING OUTFITTED WITH A DEVICE WHICH WILL TAKE A PICTURE OF THE ENGINE /ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS TO DETERMINE WHY THE ENGINE QUITS WHILE DRIVING. THIS HAS OCCURRED ABOUT 5 TIMES AND I WAS ALMOST INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT ENTERING A FREEWAY WHEN I LOST ALL POWER. I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO PRESS AN INSTALLED BUTTON THE NEXT TIME THE ENGINE STALLS. I OFTEN GET A HARD SHIFT WHEN GOING FROM REVERSE TO DRIVE. ABOUT 20% OF THE TIME. TOLD THIS PROBLEM COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED BY DEALER.*JB",
