THERE IS EXCESSIVE PAD WEAR ON THE REAR BRAKES AT 11000 MILES NOW.  WAY TOO MUCH WEAR THAN NORMAL.  DEEP SCORING IN THE ROTORS. TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP I PURCHASED IT FROM AND THEY RESURFACED THE ROTORS  BUT THE PROBLEM WAS STILL THERE AFTER I DROVE THE CAR HOME FROM THE SHOP.  SO FAR NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM BY THE DEALERSHIP OF CHEVY. *TR",
