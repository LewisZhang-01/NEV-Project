HAD TO PUT THE TRUCK IN NEUTRAL AND RESTART 8 TIMES. LEFT THE TRUCK WITH FORD DEALER FOR 2 DAYS(THEY DROVE IT HOME AND PUT 150 MILES ON TRUCK) NOTHING. PAID $140 FOR 2 HOURS LABOR. NEXT DAY PAID $256 TO GET A NEW CPS INSTALLED AND ONE WEEK LATER NO PROBLEM.  THE FORD DIESEL FORUM ON THE INTERNET HAS HUNDRED OF TRUCK OWNERS IN THE SAME BOAT. WE ALL PAY $100 OR MORE AND CARRY A SPARE CPS. NHTSA SHOULD LOOK INTO THIS AND RECALL THIS ITEM OR PUT FORD ON NOTICE BECAUSE ONE OF THESE DAYS SOMEONE IS GOING TO GET KILLED.  *JB",
