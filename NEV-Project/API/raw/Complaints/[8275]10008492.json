AT THE END OF FEBRUARY 2003 WITHIN ONE WEEK OF EACH OTHER THE DRIVERS SIDE FRONT COIL SPRINGS FRACTURED AND PUNCTURED THE TIRE. IN RESEARCH I HAVE DISCOVERED THERE WERE RECALLS IN 1998 ON THE 1993 FORD TAURUS AND IN 2001 ON THE 1998 FORD CONTOUR AND MERCURY MYSTIQUE, HOWEVER I SEE NO RECALLS CONCERNING THIS PROBLEM WITH THE 1998 AND 1999 FORD TAURUS. I WOULD APPRECIATE AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS CONCERN WITH THE 1998 AND 1999 FORD TAURUS. I BELIEVE THERE IS AN OBVIOUS PROBLEM WITH THE COIL SPRINGS ON THESE VEHICLES AS WELL. THANK YOU. *JB",
