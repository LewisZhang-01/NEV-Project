THEN ONE DAY, WHILE GOING 55 MILES AN HOUR, THE BRAKES WOULD NOT FULLY OPERATE.  THE WHOLE DASH WENT RED AND IT CAME TO A SLOW STOP.  LUCKILY NO ONE WAS IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF ME. WE CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THEY HAD A 10 YEAR RECALL OF THE SBC UNIT BUT I DON'T SEE THE RECALL ANYWHERE.  THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE!   *TR",
