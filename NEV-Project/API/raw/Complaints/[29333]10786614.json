THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT THE FUSE BOX COULD HAVE STARTED A FIRE AND HE HAS NEVER SEEN THIS HAPPEN, LET ALONE IN A VEHICLE WITH SUCH LOW MILEAGE. HE TOLD ME TO GOOGLE THE PROBLEM WITH MY CAR BECAUSE HUNDREDS OF OTHER CAR OWNERS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. SURE ENOUGH I DID JUST THAT AND I SAW HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT ABOUT THIS MODEL CAR. GM NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. ARE THEY WAITING UNTIL SOMEBODY DIES FIRST BEFORE THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM OF THE FUEL PUMP RELAY AND THE FUSE BOX?",
