BUT WHEN IT IS USED FOR A CELL PHONE THE CELL PHONE WILL NOT CHARGED AT ANY RATE.  THE CELL PHONE GOES COMPLETELY DEAD AND IT IS NO  LONGER A PART OF THE CAR/PHONE SYSTEM.  I TRIED USING DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHARGING CORDS AND I HAVE AN IPHONE 5S.   I EVEN TURN-OFF THE PHONE TO GET IT TO CHARGE BUT NOTHING WORKS.  I HAVE TO CONNECT THE PHONE TO THE BACK SEAT PLUG WHICH IS VERY INCONVENIENT.  I TOOK THE CAR TO GET CHECK AND THE TECHNICIAN INITIALLY SAID THE USC WAS OK, BUT WHEN I HAD HIM USE MY CELL WITH NO APS OPEN HE DID VERIFIED THAT THE PHONE DID NOT CHARGE AND THE POWER DEPLETED.  HE SAID HE WOULD GET BACK TO ME AFTER HE CONTACTS SOMEONE FOR FURTHER GUIDANCE.  *TR",
