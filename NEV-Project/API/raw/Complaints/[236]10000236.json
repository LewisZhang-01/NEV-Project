VW CHANGED ONLY 3 COILS, SAYING THEY WERE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH IGNITION COILS, BUT WILL NOT CHANGE A PART UNLESS IT FAILS. THE 4TH COIL FAILED YESTERDAY, 12/17/02 AND VW IS OUT OF COILS NATIONWIDE. I SPEND QUITE A BIT OF TIME ON MANY VW AND AUDI CAR OWNER WEB-BOARDS AND THE PROBLEM IS RUNNING RAMPANT. CHECK WWW.VWVORTEX.COM, WWW.AUDIFORUMS.COM TO NAME A FEW, THEN DO A WEB-SEARCH IN ARCHIVED ITEMS IN THE AUDI FORUM OR SPECIFIC CHAT ROOMS IN THE VW FORUM. THIS PROBLEM WILL COSTS LIVES IF IT IS NOT ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY.",
