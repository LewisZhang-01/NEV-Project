A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUEL RUNS DOWN THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE, ONTO THE GROUND AND ONTO PANTS AND SHOES IF YOU ARE STANDING CLOSE TO THE VEHICLE.  THE GAS FUMES GET INSIDE THE VEHICLE WHEN YOU OPEN THE VEHICLE DOOR.  THIS POSES A HAZARD TO THE PERSON PUMPING THE GAS, TO OCCUPANTS INSIDE THE VEHICLE AND TO BY STANDERS.  THIS IS A WELL DOCUMENTED PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET FOR JEEP SUV'S.  I HAVE REPLACED THE ESMI HOUSING 2 TIMES, AND THIS DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  I AM NOW TOLD I WILL NEED TO REPLACE MY ENTIRE GAS TANK BECAUSE THE ROLLOVER ANTISPILL VALVE INSIDE THE TANK IS DEFECTIVE.  I FOUND A RECALL CALLED M11 WHICH FIXES ONLY 2012 JEEP COMPASS AND 2012 JEEP PATRIOT VEHICLES THAT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.  I HAVE CALLED JEEP AND THEY STATED THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN RESOLVED AND THEY WILL NOT HELP ME.   *JS",
