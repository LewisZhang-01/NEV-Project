        "summary": "I BOUGHT A USED CAR THROUGH EBAY FROM ADAM FROM EAST COAST MOTORS USED CAR DEALER FOR $1200. HE ADVERTISED THE CAR AS HAVING   ANTI-LOCK BRAKES AND DRIVERS SIDE AIRBAG, BOTH SAFETY   FEAURES WHICH I NEEDED FOR MY GIRLFRIEND AND FUTURE CHILD.    UPON TAKING IT FOR A REQUIRED PA INSPECTION 2 WEEKS LATER,   AND SPENDING $700 FOR IT JUST TO PASS, I FOUND OUT IT   DIDN'T HAVE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES OR DRIVERS SIDE AIRBAG.  I   CONTACTED HIM AND WE AGREED ON A REFUND OF $200.  BEFORE I   GOT HIS ATTORNEY'S PAPERS TO SIGN BEFORE HE SENT THE   REFUND, I RECEIVED THE TITLE IN THE MAIL.  IT HAD 125,543   MILES ON IT, BUT THE CAR ODOMETER (AND HOW IT WAS   ADVERTISED) HAD 99,175 MILES.  I CONTACTED HIM AGAIN TRYING   TO FIND A RESOLUTION.  SINCE THE DATE OF THE REPORTED   MILEAGE WAS PAST THE DATE I BOUGHT IT, HE WILL DO NOTHING   AT ALL FOR FOR ME, NOT EVEN THE AGREED $200.  BUT THE   REPORTED MILEAGE WAS TAKEN FROM THE LAST TITLE TRANSFER,   WHEN HE BOUGHT THE CAR.  WE WAS VERY RUDE IN HIS LAST   EMAIL.  PLEASE HELP.       *JB",
