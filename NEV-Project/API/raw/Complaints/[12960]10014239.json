I AM TOLD IT IS DUE TO ROAD CONDITIONS, SUCH AS POTHOLES, ETC. THERE IS NO DAMAGE TO ANY OF MY RIMS; THEREFORE, I OBVIOUSLY DID NOT HIT ANYTHING THAT HARD.  I HAVE BEEN GETTING THE RUN AROUND FROM BOTH VOLVO AND PIRELLI WITH REGARD TO THIS ISSUE.  VOLVO TELLS ME THAT IT IS PIRELLI'S RESPONSIBILITY AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE I SPOKE TO AT PIRELLI TOLD ME THAT VOLVO IS TRYING TO AVOID THEIR RESPONSIBILITY.  HE ALSO INFORMED ME THAT HE WAS PROCESSING FOUR (4) CLAIMS THAT DAY FROM VOLVO FOR TIRE DAMAGE.  I FEEL THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THESE TIRES AND I AM DRIVING AT RISK TO MY CHILDREN AND MYSELF.  I HAVE PUT OUT OVER $500 FOR TIRES IN THE LAST MONTH AND I AM VERY NERVOUS ABOUT CONTINUING TO OPERATE MY VEHICLE ON THESE TIRES.  I WOULD APPRECIATE ANYTHING YOU COULD DO TO ASSIST ME IN GETTING SOME SATISFACTION FROM EITHER VOLVO OR PIRELLI TIRES.  I AM VERY NERVOUS ABOUT DRIVING THE CAR WITH THESE TIRES.   *NLM",
