        "summary": "THIS LETTER IS TO REPORT A VERY UNSAFE CONDITION THAT EXISTS WITH  MY 1998 LEXUS GS 300.  ON 2/02/03  I WAS WAITING AT A CAR WASH  IN A LINE OF TRAFFIC WITH MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE, WHEN ALL OF THE SUDDEN MY ENGINE ADVANCED TO WHAT SEEM LIKE FULL THROTTLE.  THE REAR TIRES BEGAN TO SPIN ON THE WET PAVEMENT BUT MY FULL PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE KEPT THE CAR FROM LUNGING FORWARD.  MY WIFE LEANED OVER TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON AND SAW MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND NOT ON THE GAS!  AT THAT TIME I STARTED TO SHIFT THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL BUT DECIDED IT WOULD BE BEST TO TURN OF THE IGNITION.   BEFORE I GOT MY HAND ON THE KEY THE ENGINE WENT BACK TO IDLE!   THIS WHOLE EVENT LASTED 5 TO 10 SECONDS.  MY FOOT WAS DEFINITELY NOT ON THE GAS!  AT THAT TIME MY WIFE TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED TO HER THE WEEK BEFORE THIS SCARY EVENT.  SHE WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AT ABOUT 55 MPH  WHEN THE CAR BEGAN TO ACCELERATE RAPIDLY   WITH OUT  PRESSING ON THE GAS PEDDLE.  SHE SAID SHE HAD TO APPLY A LOT OF BRAKE PRESSURE TO KEEP THE CAR FROM ACCELERATING OVER THE SPEED LIMIT.  THIS ALSO LASTED ABOUT 5 TO 10 SECONDS!   SERVICE FROM  THE LEXUS DEALER IS GREAT BUT THEY TOLD ME MY CAR COULDN'T  DO THAT, AND THAT  ALL COMPUTERS CHECKED OUT OK!  ALSO A  FACTORY SERVICE REP SAID THIS SAME THING!   I EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT IT DID HAPPEN  AND  THAT I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE A CAR THAT HAD A MIND OF ITS OWN.  THEIR ANSWER WAS, NO ERROR CODES IN THE CARS COMPUTER SO NOTHING IS WRONG! THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A DEADLY SITUATION BOTH TIMES!   SOMETHING MUST GET DONE BEFORE SOMEONE GETS SERIOUSLY HURT OR KILLED.",
