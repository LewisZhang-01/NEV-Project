THIS IS DUE TO THE FAILURE OF THE POWER ASSIST AND POWER STEERING PUMP.  THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THESE COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN REPLACED.  THIS WAS FIRST NOTICED AND REPLACED IN JANUARY 2002.  THE SECOND TIME OCCURRED IN FEBRUARY 2003.  ON 6/11/2003 THE VEHICLE AGAIN SHOWED INDICATIONS OF A PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES AND STEERING.  THE BRAKE PEDAL BEGAN TO PULSATE, AND A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE COULD BE HEARD WHEN TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL.  THE VEHICLE ALSO EXPERIENCES PROBLEMS WHEN BRAKING OVER ROUGH ROAD, SUCH AS RUMBLE STRIPS.  AS THIS IS A THIRD PROBLEM WITH THESE CRITICAL COMPONENTS, THE SAFETY OF THIS VEHICLE IS IN QUESTION.  THE LAST VISIT TO THE DEALER WAS SAID TO BE LOOSE BOLTS ON THE POWER STEERING GEAR BOX.  THE POWER ASSIST DESIGN IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THIS VEHICLE.  I HAVE SPOKEN WITH SERVICE WRITERS, SERVICE MANAGERS AND HAVE READ OTHER REPORTS CONCERNING OTHER INCIDENTS LIKE I EXPERIENCED WITH THIS VEHICLE.   *NLM",
