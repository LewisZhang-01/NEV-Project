THE ONLY COMPLAINTS THAT  I HAVE WITH THIS VEHICLE, IS THAT THE RIDE IS A BIT ROUGH. AND IT IS A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE FOR TALLER PEOPLE ON LONG RIDES. TO THOSE THAT ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE VEHICLE PULLING TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT. CURE #1, GET THE CAR ALIGNED. #2, CHECK THE ROAD YOU ARE DRIVING ON, THE TRACK WIDTH ON THE XTERRA IS NARROW, IT MAY BE CATCHING A GROOVE IN THE ROAD. #3 CHECK THE TIRE PRESSURES,  TO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE BRAKING....... HAVE THE BRAKES CHECKED, ROTORS, PADS, OR CALIPERS COULD BE STICKING.   *NLM",
