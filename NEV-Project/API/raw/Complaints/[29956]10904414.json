THE DEALERSHIP WOULD NOT LOOK AT THE CAR AS THEY BLAMED ME FOR NOT ROLLING UP MY WINDOWS AND AFTER COMPLAINING TO THE OWNER THEY WERE FORCED TO LOOK AND FOUND THE BACK HATCH HAD A CRACK UP UNDER THE RACK AREA, WHICH WAS CAUSING WATER TO COME IN THE CAR, THE SUN ROOF SMALL TUBES CLOGGED AND COVERED BY A RUBBER LINING CAUSING WATER TO BACK UP INTO THE BACK SEAT FLOORS. I WAS TOLD THIS WAS SOMETHING I NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF AS I NEEDED TO BLOW ARE PRESSURE IN THESE SMALL TUBES OFTEN TO CLEAR DEBRIS TO PREVENT WATER FROM BACKING UP AND GOING INTO THE BACK SEAT. THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW AND THE CAR SMELLS OF MOLD AND STILL IS TAKING IN SO MUCH WATER AND THE FLOOR I FEEL IS GOING TO RUST OUT AND RENDER THE CAR USELESS. AS I HAVE OWNED MANY CARS WITH SUNROOFS AND NEVER HAVE I EVER HAD TO DO THAT AND OTHERS WHO OWN THIS KIND OF CAR DO NOT HAVE THIS ISSUE.",
