THE SULFURIC ACID HAD BURNED THROUGH THE  FLOORBOARD.  THE CONSUMER WAS UNSURE OF WHAT CAUSED THE  ILLNESS, BUT DISCOVERED THE LEAKING BATTERY ON 10/02/02.  THE MANUFACTURER CLAIMED NO RESPONSIBILITY, STATING THAT THE BATTERY WAS PROPERLY VENTED.  *MR  THERE WAS A CLICKING NOISE WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS STARTED, THE BATTERY VENTS WERE FLIMSY AND NOT SECURELY FASTENED TO THE BATTERY VENT OPENINGS.  THE VIBRATIONS WOULD  EASILY SHAKE THE VENT TUBES FROM THE BATTERY.  THE CONSUMER REQUESTED REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE MONIES SPENT ON THE REPAIR OF THE FAULTY BATTERY VENTING SYSTEM.  *SCC",
