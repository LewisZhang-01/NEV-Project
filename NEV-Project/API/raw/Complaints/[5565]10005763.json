AFTER GETTING OUT OF THE CAR, I REALIZED THAT THERE WAS A PUDDLE OF TRANSMISSION FLUID UNDERNEATH THE CAR.  I HAD A MECHANIC LOOK AT IT - THERE'S A HOLE IN THE GEAR BOX WHERE THE TRANSMISSION SHOT THE PARK GEAR RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX - HE SAID IT HAD TO BE A DEFECT.  [THERE'S ONLY 16,000 MILES ON THE CAR]  I CALLED CHRYSLER REGARDING THIS [& WAS TREATED EXTREMELY RUDELY BY THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT, MIGHT I ADD.] & THEY REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.  THEY TOLD ME THAT BECAUSE THE CAR IS NO LONGER UNDER WARANTEE, THE DEFECT IS NOT THEIR PROBLEM",
