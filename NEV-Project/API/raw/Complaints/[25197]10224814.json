VEHICLE IS 2001 FORD RANGER XLT 4 X 4.  5 YEARS OR 50 MILE WARRANTY WHICH I DO NOT FALL UNDER BECAUSE I DO NOT DRIVE MUCH, AND REGARDLESS OF MY LOW MILEAGE THE DEALERSHIP WILL NOT HONOR THIS DEFECT.    THIS IS THE SECOND MAJOR DEFECT I HAVE FOUND ON THIS VEHICLE.  THERE WAS AN RECALL ON THE EGR SENSOR, WHICH APPEARED AT AROUND 36,000 MILES.  BECAUSE I DRIVE RARELY IT DIDN'T OCCUR UNTIL IT'S 7 YEAR AND AGAIN I WAS PENALIZED FOR \"GOING GREEN\", AND HAD TO PAY FOR THIS FULL REPAIR.  CAN YOU PLEASE ASSIST ME TO FIND OUT IF THIS AIRBAG IS AN ACTUAL DEFECT.  I  HAVE SEEN OTHER DISCUSSION GROUPS MENTION THE FORD RANGER HAVING THE FLASHING AIR BAG LIGHT AT EARLY MILEAGE.  *TR",
