THERE WAS A RECALL ON SOME SUBURBANS, AND BLAZERS, BUT THE YEAR ONLY WENT UP TO I THINK 1997. THE RECALL HAD TO DO WITH THE WIPERS STOPPING DURING OPERATION. I  CALLED CHEVEROLET JUST TO SEE IF OUR YEAR WAS GOING TO BE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL, AND HE REPLIED NO, AND THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE. HE SAID HE COULD CALL A DEALER AND HAVE ME TAKE IT TO THEM AND I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR ANY REPAIRS. I CANNOT AFFORD TO TAKE IT IN RIGHT NOW, SO HOPEFULLY THERE WILL BE A RECALL IN THE FUTURE. THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME I USE THE WIPERS.   *JB",
