        "summary": "I HAD A DODGE INTREPID THAT HAS HAD NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS WITH THE ENGINE.  WHEN I WENT ONLINE TO DO RESEARCH I FOUND OUT THAT THERE WERE MANY OTHER COMPLAINTS, THE SAME AS I HAD.  I WANT TO KNOW WHY NO-ONE HAS DONE ANYTHING IN REGARDS TO THIS PROBLEM.  I ACTUALLY HAD A PART PERSON AT FIRESIDE DODGE IN MODESTO TELL ME THAT A PART I WAS BUYING WAS A KNOWN DEFECT PART AND THAT IS WHY THEY CHANGED IT BUT THEY WEREN'T PUTTING OUT A NOTICE UNTIL THEY WERE FORCED TO BECAUSE IT WAS EXPENSIVE,  I PUT THE LATEST INCIDENT AS THE DATE BUT THIS IS THE THIRD TRAGIC INCIDENT WITH THIS ENGINE.  THE FIRST INCIDENT WAS WHEN I HAD TO HAVE ALL MY RODS REPLACED IN THE ENGINE BECAUSE OF A SLUDGE BUILD-UP IN THE ENGINE.  THE SECOND INCIDENT WAS WHEN A PART CONNECTED TO MY RADIATOR BLEW OFF AND I HAD TO REPLACE THAT.  NOW, THIS THIRD INCIDENT AND I STILL NOT HAVE A DIAGNOSIS ON WHAT IS WRONG BUT IT IS LEANING TO THE HEADS, HEAD GASKET, AND PISTON RINGS.    PLEASE LOOK AT THESE WEBSITE AND START AN INVESTIGATION INTO DODGE ABOUT THIS ENGINE.  IT IS NOT FAIR THAT HONEST, HARD WORKING PEOPLE HAVE TO DEAL WITH FAULTY ENGINEERING.    I AM LUCKY THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN HURT ON ANY TIME MY CAR HAS BROKEN DOWN BECAUSE ALL THREE TIMES I WAS ON A MAJOR FREEWAY, ONCE COMING HOME FROM STOCKTON ON HIGHWAY 99 THE OTHER TWO HAPPENED WHEN I WAS OVER 2 HOURS FROM HOME AND I HAD TO PAY A $575.00 TOW TRUCK FEE EACH TIME TO GET MY CAR HOME.
