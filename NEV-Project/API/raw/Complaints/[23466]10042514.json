THE DEALER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM.   *AK   THE VIEW WAS OBSTRUCTED FOR VEHICLES TO THE RIGHT, THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS BLOCKED THE VIEW IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AS WELL AS WHEN LOOKING BACK TO CHANGE LANES OR BACK UP.  THE CONSUMER HAD TO REMOVE THE REAR HEADRESTS TO AVOID PROBLEMS.  WHEN THE REAR WINDOWS WERE OPENED 1/2 TO FULL, THERE WAS A TUNNEL TYPE OF SENSATION AND THE VEHICLE WOULD SHAKE.  THE VEHICLE WOULD BE AT A STOP SIGN AND WHEN NEEDING TO TURN LEFT, THE CONSUMER WAS UNABLE TO GET A CLEAR VIEW OF APPROACHING TRAFFIC ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  THERE WAS A SPAN OF TIME WHEN THE VEHICLES WERE COMPLETELY BLOCKED BY THE FRAME ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WINDSHIELD.  THE CONSUMER ATTEMPTED TO ADJUST THE HEIGHT AND DISTANCE OF THE SEAT POSITION, BUT WAS LIMITED DUE TO HEIGHT RESTRICTIONS.  OTHER CONSUMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM.  (THE WIDTH OF THE PANEL/FRAME SEEMED TO BE A PART OF THE PROBLEM WHICH ALSO SEEMED TO BE A THE LATE MODEL ISSUE)   *SCC  *JB",
