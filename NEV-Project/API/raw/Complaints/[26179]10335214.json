I BOUGHT MY CAR NEW AND I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM FOR AT LEAST A YEAR, I'M NOT SURE OF THE DATE THIS PROBLEM STARTED. HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM AND PUT NEW TRANSMISSION IN AND PROBLEM IS STILL NOT FIXED. HYUNDAI AND DEALERSHIP ARE REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE TO DRIVE MY FAMILY IN THIS VEHICLE AND I WON'T.  I CAN'T SEEM TO GET ANYONE TO HELP ME. *TR",
