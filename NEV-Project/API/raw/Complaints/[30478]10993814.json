ON IMPACT, I PUSHED THE BREAK ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FLOOR, WITHOUT ANY RESISTANCE.  JUST PRIOR TO THAT, THE BREAKS WERE SLOWING-DOWN THE CAR AS EXPECTED.  MY CAR SLAMMED INTO THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. THERE WERE NO BREAK MARKS ON THE HIGHWAY AS ONE WOULD EXPECT IF THE BREAKS WERE WORKING.  THE BREAKS SIMPLY FAILED.  AFTER RELEASING THE BREAKS, SHOUTING OFF THE ENGINE AND LATER STARTING IT UP, THE BREAKS ARE CURRENTLY WORKING AS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.",
