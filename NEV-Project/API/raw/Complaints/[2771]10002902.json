        "summary": "I HAVE A 1997 BUICK PARK AVENUE WITH 103,000 MILES.  I PURCHASED THE CAR NEW IN APRIL OF 1997.   AFTER 10 MONTHS AND 16,000 MILES I BEGAN TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSIMISSION SHIFTING HARD AFTER THE CAR GOT WARMED UP.  IF I WOULD STOP AND TURN THE CAR OFF AND LET IT SIT FOR 15 SECONDS AND RESTART IT SHIFT SMOOTH FOR SEVERAL STOPS AND THEN START SHIFTING HARD AGAIN.  I TOOK IT INTO A BUICK GARAGE AND THEY KEPT THE CAR FOR 10 DAYS AND COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM.  FINALLY THEY DECIDED TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION.  THAT SOLVED THE PROBLEM.  AT 90,000 MILES THE SAME PROBLEM REOCCURED.  IT DIDN'T DO IT THAT OFTEN TO BEGIN WITH BUT NOW ONE YEAR LATER IT DOES IT ALMOST EVERY TIME I DRIVE THE CAR AFTER IT GET COMPLETELY WARMED UP.  GIVEN IT HAS HAPPENED TWICE TO MY CAR IT WOULD APPEAR THERE IS A DEFECT HERE THAT BUICK SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR.  I HAVE LOOKED OVER YOU SIGHT AND FOUND NO RECALLS FOR THE TYPE OF PROBLEM.  ARE THERE ANY OUT THERE THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF?  WHAT ELSE CAN I DO?  MEL RUTLIN",
