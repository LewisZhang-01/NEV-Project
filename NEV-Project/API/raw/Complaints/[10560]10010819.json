        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING THROUGH A TUNNEL IN BOSTON AND MY TRUCK SUDDENLY DIED FOR NO APPARENT REASON.  I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER FAR TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BUT WAS STILL IN THE TRAVEL LANE.  THE ODOMETER WAS FLASHING \"NO BUS\" AND ALL THE DASHBOARD INDICATOR LIGHTS WERE ON.  THE VEHICLE SHOWED NO MECHANICAL SIGNS OF FAILURE PRIOR TO STALLING AND MADE NO NOISE WHEN STALLING - IT JUST DIED.  AFTER BEING TOWED OUT OF THE TUNNEL (30 MIN. AFTER THE VEHICLE STALLING),  I ATTEMPTED TO START THE TRUCK AND IT STARTED RIGHT UP.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY HAD NO SERVICE APPOINTMENTS FOR ONE WEEK.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.  THEN, TODAY (MARCH 21), THE TRUCK DIED AGAIN IN THE SAME TUNNEL ON MY WAY HOME FROM WORK.  THIS TIME, IT STARTED UP AFTER 5 MINUTES BEFORE THE TOW TRUCK ARRIVED.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND DODGE SEEMS UNINTERESTED IN FIXING IT PROMPTLY.    *JB",
