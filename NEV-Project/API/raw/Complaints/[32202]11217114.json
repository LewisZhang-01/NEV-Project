        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING MYSELF TO MY EMT SALARY, FULL BENEFIT JOB WHEN MY CAR BEGAN TO SMOKE. WHEN I PULLED OVER AND LIFTED THE HOOD FLAMES CAME ROARING OUT. I PERSONALLY WAS ABLE TO PUT IT OUT BEING A FORMER FIRE FIGHTER. NOW INSURANCE SAYS THEY CAN NOT COVER THIS DUE TO IT BEING AN ENGINE FAILURE. DESPITE FULL COVERAGE, GAP INSURANCE, AND FIRE CASUALTY INSURANCE THEY COULD NOT PAY OUT FOR A NEW ENGINE. ONLY THE FIRE DAMAGE DONE UNDER THE HOOD AND NOTHING ELSE. THE DEALERSHIP EXPLAINED I NEEDED AN ENTIRELY NEW ENGINE PUT IN AND THAT IT WOULD COST 7,000.00. I HAD THIS CAR LESS THEN 6 MONTHS WHEN IT CAUGHT FIRE. I ALSO HAVE 11,000.00+ LOAN OUT ON THIS CAR. I FILED A CLAIM WITH FORD MOTOR AND THEY HAVE IGNORED ALL MY ATTEMPTS. I AM UNABLE TO GET ANOTHER LOAN DUE TO ALREADY HAVING AN OPEN CAR LOAN AND NOT ENOUGH CREDIT. I LOST MY JOB AS A RESULT TO NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD A RENTAL AFTER BLOWING THROUGH MY ENTIRE SAVINGS FOR ONE. I TEMPORARILY LOST CUSTODY OF MY SON DUE TO NOT TRANSPORTATION TO HIS SCHOOL. I LOST MY HOME DUE TO NOT HAVING MY FULL TIME JOB ANYMORE. I AM NEARING THE POINT OF LIVING ON THE STREETS. I LOST MY EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMAL DUE TO HAVING NO HOME. PLEASE HELP A SINGLE MOTHER COME BACK FROM SUCH A LOSS.    *JS",
