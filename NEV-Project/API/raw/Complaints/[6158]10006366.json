THE BRAKES CAUSE THE FRONT END TO SHAKE THE STEERING WHEEL SO VIOLENTLY THAT STOPPING IN AN EMERGENCY WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE. THIS HAPPENS EVERYDAY, WINTER OR SUMMER, TO AND FROM WORK WHICH IS 20 MILES TOTAL WITH 15 MILES ON THE FREEWAY. I  HAD THE BRAKES RE-DONE AT 36,000 MILES AND THEY STARTED SHAKING WITHIN ONE MONTH.  THIS SHAKING CONTINUES MILDLY WHEN DRIVING AT 65 MILES PER HOUR WHICH ALSO CAUSES TIRES TO WEAR OUT.  *MR   *NLM    *DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS**741839",
