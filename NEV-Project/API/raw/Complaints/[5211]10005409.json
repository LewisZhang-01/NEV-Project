AT 3.5 YEARS/78402 MILES AFTER PURCHASE, ONE OF THE 4 COIL PACKS ON MY 1999 VW PASSAT FAILED, LEAVING THE VEHICLE RUNNING ON 3 CYLINDERS TO TRANSPORT ME TO THE DEALER FOR REPLACEMENT.  THE COST WAS $174.25, BUT FORTUNATELY THERE WAS A REPLACEMENT COIL IN STOCK, SO THE VEHICLE WAS UNAVAILABLE BUT FOR 1 DAY.    I HAVE RECEIVED NOTIFICATION THAT VW IS PAYING FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THIS PART ON 2001 AND 2002 PASSATS, BUT WHY NOT MY 1999?",
