WE HAD IT REPLACED BUT IT STILL MAKES NOISE, STILL SHUDDERS WHEN GOING LOW SPEEDS, ETC.  WE NOTICED THAT SOMEONE ELSE ON YOUR WEBSITE HAS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM BUT WAS TOLD SINCE IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY CHRYSLER WOULDN'T FIX IT.  WE AGREE THAT THERE IS A SERIOUS DESIGN DEFECT PROBLEM AND CHRYSLER NEEDS TO RECALL AND FIX IT!  *JB",
