I HAD MY TRUCK TOWED TO A LOCAL DEALERSHIP, THEY FOUND MY BRAKE SYSTEM TO BE CONTAMINATED AND TOLD ME THAT ALL PARTS OF THE SYSTEM WITH RUBBER IN THEM WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED. AFTER ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF, I WAS INFORMED THAT THEY COULD FIND ALL THE PARTS EXCEPT ONE, THE COMBINATION OR PROPORTIONING VALVE. I PAID FOR THE DIAGNOSTICS TEST AND HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO ANOTHER LOCAL DEALER-I NEEDED A SECOND OPINION, NOT UNDERSTANDING WHY A DEALERSHIP COULD NOT FIX MY TRUCK. I TOLD THE SECOND DEALERSHIP MY STORY, THEY DID A DIAGNOSTIC TEST OF THEIR OWN AND CAME UP WITH THE SAME EXACT CONCLUSION, INCLUDING THE FACT THAT THEY COULD NOT FIND THE COMBINATION VALVE. I BOUGHT ANOTHER CAR AND WAS PLANNING ON SELLING THE TRUCK, BUT NOW AM UNABLE TO DO THAT, AS IT HAS NO BRAKES AND THEY CAN'T BE FIXED. I'M WRITING THIS IN HOPES THAT SOMEONE ELSE THAT IS LOOKING TO BUY A TRUCK LIKE THIS UNDERSTANDS THE SITUATION IF THIS PROBLEM HAPPENS TO THEM.",
