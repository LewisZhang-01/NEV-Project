        "summary": "I HAVE NOTICED THAT WHEN DRIVING OVER ROUGH ROAD, OR AFTER AN ABRUPT POTHOLE, ALL ELECTRONICS IN THE CAR WILL SHUT OFF. AFTER ABOUT FIVE MINUTES A RESET WILL START AND, EVEN THOUGH I'M STILL DRIVING, ALL THE DASH LIGHTS AND TEST WILL GO THROUGH THE CYCLE USUALLY RESERVED FOR WHEN I START THE CAR.    IF I HAPPEN TO TURN OFF THE CAR WHILE IT IS IN THIS SORT OF OUTAGE, IT WILL REQUIRE A JUMP TO START.    THE RADIO WILL FORGET ITS STATIONS, AND THE CLOCK WILL NEED TO HAVE THE TIME SET AGAIN.    I HAVE TRIED MY OWN REMEDIES (LIKE JIGGLING THE FUSE BOX (WHICH DOES NOT SEEM WELL ATTACHED), AND WIGGLING WIRES) TRYING TO TRACK DOWN THE PROBELM WITH NO SUCCESS.  MY PRIVATE MECHANIC SAYS THAT HE HAS SEEN THIS IN OTHER MIRAGES AND NEVER FOUND THE CAUSE.    IT ONLY HAPPENS ABOUT A SECOND AFTER A LARGE BUMP OR HEAVY REPEATED VIBRATIONS.    I BOUGHT THE CAR USED (FROM ENTERPRISE RENTALS), HAVE OWNED IT ABOUT A YEAR, AND IT HAS HAPPENED FOUR TIMES.    THANK YOU FOR THE GOOD WORK YOU DO. I HOPE THIS HELPS.",
