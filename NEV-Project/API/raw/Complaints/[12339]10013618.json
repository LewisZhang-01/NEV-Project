AFTER TAKING MY CAR TO THE BUICK DEALER TWO TIMES I AM INFORMED THAT GM RESPONDED THAT THERE ARE NO FEDERAL REGULATIONS REGARDING THE ACCURACY OF AN ODOMETER. BUICK (G.M.) RESPONDED THAT 4% ERROR IS ACCEPTABLE TO THEM. I HAVE A COPY OF THE G.M. RESPONSE TO THE DEALER(G.M. DOCUMENT ID#1216409---SERVICE VME-ODOMETER ACCURACY, #PI00746-(12/24/2002).   WHEN I FILE MY FEDERAL TAX RETURN-FORM 2106 BUSINESS EXPENSE SINCE I TRAVEL 40,000 MILES A YEAR I WOULD BE OVER REPORTING 1.600 MILES AT A 4% RATE.  IS THERE A FEDERAL REGULATION REGARDING THE ACCURACY OF AN ODOMETER. I AM ABLE TO FIND STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS REGARDING FRAUD AND ROLL-BACK OF AN ODOMETER BUT NOTHING REGARDING THE ACCURACY.  THIS WOULD ALSO HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE REGULATED FUEL MPG REQUIREMENTS. ANY PUBLISHED MPG WOULD NEED TO BE REDUCED BY 4%.*JB",
