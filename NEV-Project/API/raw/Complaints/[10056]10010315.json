IF THIS IS NORMAL, WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE GAUGE ON THE DASH? HOW CAN I TELL IF MY TRANSMISSION IS OVER HEATING WHEN HAULING A HEAVY LOAD? THE GAUGE IS NOT RELIABLE. FORD TELLS ME THE GAUGE WILL REGISTER IF THE TRANSMISSION BEGINS TO OVER HEAT. WELL IT'S REGISTERING EVEN WHEN THE TRANSMISSION IS COLD FROM SITTING OVER NIGHT! HOW CAN I RELY ON THIS??? FORD TELLS ME THEY WILL NOT REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION IF IT IS DAMAGED FROM OVERHEATING. WELL, I HAVE NO RELIABLE WAY OF TELLING IF IT IS OVERHEATING. WHY PUT A GAUGE ON THE DASH ONLY FOR SHOW? WHY SHOULD I PAY EXTRA FOR SOMETHING THAT SERVES ABSOLUTELY NO PURPOSE IF FORD SAID IT WAS NORMAL.*JB",
