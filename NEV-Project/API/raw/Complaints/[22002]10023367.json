THE REASON I\u0019M WRITING IS IN HOPES THAT WE CAN GET A SAFETY ISSUE ADDRESSED, AND CORRECTED ONCE AND FOR ALL. THERE HAS BEEN A REPEATED TREND OVER SEVERAL YEARS NOW CONCERNING THE LIFT PUMP (FUEL TRANSFER PUMP) UTILIZED IN THE 2500/3500 CUMMINS DIESEL APPLICATION. I AM A MEMBER OF THE FAILED LIFT PUMP CLUB AND HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS LIFT PUMP FAILURE ON MY 2000 3500 DODGE CTD. THIS FAILURE CAUSES THE TRUCK TO LOOSE POWER AND SOMETIMES DIE.  THIS CAN BE LIFE THREATENING IF THE TRUCK OWNER IS ON THE HIGHWAY TOWING A LOADED TRAILER.  I HOW OWN A 2002 3500 CTD AND WOULD LIKE THIS DESIGN PROBLEM CORRECTED.  I AM NOT ALONE IN THIS CONCERN, THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF 1998.5 - 2002, 24 VALVE CUMMINS TURBO DIESEL OWNERS THAT ARE CONCERNED AND HAVE COMPLAINED TO DODGE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WITH NO RESOLUTION.  THIS CAN BE DOCUMENTED BY GOING TO THE TURBO DIESEL REGISTER ON THE WEB. HTTP://WWW.TURBODIESELREGISTER.COM/FORUMS/SHOWTHREAD.PHP?S=&THREADID=75368&PERPAGE=15&PAGENUMBER=2.   *NLM",
