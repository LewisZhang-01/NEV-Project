        "summary": "I JUST TOOK MY 98 INTREPID  (35,000 MILES) INTO THE SHOP TODAY DUE TO THE OIL PRESSURE LIGHT COMING ON AT IDLE. IT TURNS OUT THAT THE SHOP OWNER HAS SEEN 2 OTHER INTREPID'S IN THE LAST MONTH WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. AFTER HE CALLED THE DODGE DEALERSHIP, HE LET ME KNOW THAT IT IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM THEY ARE HAVING WITH THESE ENGINES BUILDING UP SLUDGE. MY MECHANIC INFORMED ME THAT THE BUILDUP IN MY ENGINE IS SIGNIFICANT AND THAT IT IS IN DANGER OF COMPLETE FAILURE VERY SOON. THE ONLY REMEDY THAT CAN BE OFFERED IS TO HAVE THE ENGINE COMPLETELY REPLACED AT A COST OF AROUND $6,000 AND IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE DODGE/CHRYSLER WARRANTY. THIS ENGINE IS LESS THAN 5 YEARS OLD AND ONLY HAS 35,000 MILES ON IT. I HAVE  HAD REGULAR OIL CHANGES EVERY 3,000 MILES AND  HAVE THE RECEIPTS TO PROVE IT. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN EXPECT THIS TO BE MY PROBLEM TO FIX AND AFTER RESEARCHING IT FURTHER ONLINE I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THIS SITUATION. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE IS ANY ADDITIONAL INFO ON THIS TOPIC THAT IS AVAILABLE.   *NLM",
