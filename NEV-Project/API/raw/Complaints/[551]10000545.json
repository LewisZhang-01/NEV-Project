SO BASICALLY I'M STUCK WITH MY CAR MAKING THE POPPING NOISE BECAUSE HONDA DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM.I AM VERY UNSATISFIED WITH HONDA AND THE PERFORMANCE OF MY CAR.MY CAR IS A 2001 HONDA CIVIC. I HAVE HAD IT FOR TWO YEARS AND I HAVE HAD TWO RECALLS ON IT AND JUST RECENTLY MY CAR HAS BEEN MAKING A POPPING NOISE WHEN I TURN MY STEERING WHEEL OR PRESS ON THE BRAKES.I HAVE TAKEN MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP THREE TIMES WITH IN THE PAST WEEK AND EVERY TIME I PICK UP MY CAR THEY TELL ME THE NOISE IS GONE.I DRIVE IT OFF THE LOT ONLY TO FIND OUT THE NOISE IS STILL THERE. MY CAR IS CURRENTLY AT THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY MY CAR IS MAKING THE POPPING NOISE WHEN I TURN THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE LAST TIME I DROPPED IT OFF THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT THEY COULD DO ABOUT THE BRAKES.I FIND IT VERY DISTURBING TO KNOW THAT MY CARS BRAKE PADS ARE SHIFTING AND HONDA WILL NOT FIX THE PROBLEM SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW. I DO NOT WANT TO BE TRAVELING DOWN THE FREEWAY AND MY BRAKES FAIL BECAUSE HONDA DID NOT FEEL THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM EARLIER.I WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD  LOOK INT THIS ISSUE AND CONTACT ME BACK WITH SOME INFORMAION.THANKYOU.",
