I CALL AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT IMMEDIATELY AND THEY TOLD ME TO LEAVE THE VEHICLE AND THEY WOULD RUN DIAGNOSTICS SEE WHAT WAS CAUSING IT.  THE NEXT DAY THEY CLEARED THE CODE CALLED AND TOLD ME TO PICK UP.  WHEN I WAS LEAVING THE SAME LIGHTS CAME ON AGAIN (ENGINE, VSC ETC).  GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND TOLD SERVICE REP. THAT THE SAME THING WAS HAPPENING AGAIN.  I LEFT THE CAR OVER THE WEEKEND AND THEY CALL AND SAID IT WAS A COMMUNICATION ERROR AND THE COMPUTER WASN'T COMMUNICATING WITH THE PARKING BRAKE.  I TRULY BELIEVE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY THE MANUFACTURER.  *TR",
