        "summary": "THE AUTOMATIC SEAT BELT ON MY 1991 HONDA CIVIC FAILS TO CLOSE ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE. IT IS STUCK IN THE \"OPEN\" POSITION INTERFERING WITH DRIVING AND NOT PROVIDING ANY SHOULDER RESTRAINT.   THE COMPONENT THAT RIDES ALONG THE FRONT DOOR TRACK WHERE THE SEAT BELT OPENS AND CLOSES WILL NOT MANUALLY MOVE ALONG THE TRACK. IT APPEARS, THIS IS THE WAY THE SEAT BELT IS CONSTRUCTED, IT CAUSES TENSION OR PULLS ON THE COMPONENT THAT SLIDES ALONG THE DOOR. THAT MAY CAUSE AN OBSTACLE TO MY SEAT BELT CLOSING.  I PREVIOUSLY HAD A FAULTY DOOR LATCH ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE, WHICH I HAD REPLACED WITH A NEW DOOR LATCH, AT MY OWN EXPENSE. THE DOOR LATCH FAILURE WAS MAKING THE SEAT BELT OPEN AND CLOSE WHILE DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY. THE OPENING AND CLOSING OF THE SEAT BELT ALSO DAMAGED THE SUN VISOR.  I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS CAR WITH SUCH A FLAKY SEAT BELT AND WOULD LIKE HONDA TO REPAIR THIS DEFECT ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE WARRANTY.  *JB",
