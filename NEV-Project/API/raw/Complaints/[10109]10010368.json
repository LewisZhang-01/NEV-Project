        "summary": "TODAY I HAVE 88000 MILES ON MY 1999 HONDA ACCORD V6 COUPE.  I AM CURRENTLY ON MY THIRD TRANSMISSION.  THE FIRST TIME, MY CAR WAS DRIVING VERY ROUGH AT AROUND 23000 MI.  EVERY TIME I WOULD ACCELERATE, WHEN MY CAR SHIFTED FROM FIRST TO SECOND GEAR, THE CAR WOULD GIVE A STRONG JERK, ONE THAT WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO SHAKE THE COINS IN THE COIN HOLDER.  I TOOK THE CAR TO HONDA AND THEY TOLD ME IT WAS OK, AND THEY COULD NOT DIAGNOSE ANY PROBLEMS.  AROUND 30000 MILES, MY TRANSMISSION WOULD NOT SHIFT OUT OF SECOND GEAR.  I TOOK IT BACK TO HONDA AND THEY REPLACED IT WITH OUT ANY PROBLEM.  LATER, AROUND 60000 MILES, MY TRANSMISSION LOST ALL FORWARD DRIVING GEARS.  KEEP IN MIND THIS IS THE SECOND TRANSMISSION.  I HAD IT TOWED TO A GAS STATION, AND CALLED HONDA, ONLY TO HEAR, THE CAR IS OUT OF WARRANTY.  THE DECISION WAS MADE TO GET THE WORK DONE AT THE  GAS STATION.  THEY ACQUIRED A NEW TRANSMISSION FROM HONDA TO BE PLACED INTO MY CAR.  TONIGHT, THAT TRANSMISSION IS NOW WITHOUT FIRST AND THIRD GEARS.  THE CAR WONT SHIFT EITHER.  THE CAR NEEDS TO BE PLACED IN SECOND GEAR, AND SHIFTED TO THIRD MANUALLY FOR IT TO FUNCTION.  IF IT IS STARTED IN 1,D3,OR D4 IT WILL START IN SECOND GEAR AND STAY IN IT.  I HAVE 90000 MI ON MY CAR TODAY.  THIS SEEMS TO OCCUR EVERY 30000 MI OR SO.*JB",
