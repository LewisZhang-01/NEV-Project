BECAME VERY RANDOM IN BEGINNING ROUGHLY 2-4 MONTHS AGO PROGRESSING INTO DAILY TO AND FROM WORK, INITIALLY IT SEEMED TO BE MORE FREQUENT WHEN CAR WAS HOT OR AT NORMAL OPERATING TEMPERATURES AND NOW IS STILL SPORADIC BUT HAPPENS SOMETIMES WITHIN 5 MINUTES OF OPERATION.              THE NEXT ISSUE IS THE HORN WILL NOT SOUND UNLESS IT IS HIT IN A VERY SPECIFIC WAY, I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS DUE TO SAFETY ISSUES AND THE INABILITY TO REMEMBER HOW TO HIT THE SWEET SPOT IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS.  LATER TODAY I WILL BE MAKING VIDEOS OF THIS DEFAULT AND THEN TAKING TO DEALER FOR THE SECOND TIME TO HAVE REPAIRED OR REPLACED.",
