        "summary": "MY DAUGHTER HAS A 2012 HONDA CIVIC. IT HAS NOT BEEN IN A CRASH, BUT THE DRIVERS AIR BAG IS SPLITTING OPEN JUST BELOW THE H IN THE COVER ON THE STEERING WHEEL. I HAVE BEEN IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY FOR OVER 37 YEARS. I REPAIRED THEM AND HAVE WORKED FOR AN INSURANCE COMPANY FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS HAPPEN BEFORE, BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE SPLIT IS WHERE THE AIR BAG WOULD OPEN IF THERE WAS A DEPLOYMENT.    SHE DID BUY THE CAR USED FROM ANOTHER LOCAL DEALER, BUT THERE IS NO INDICATION OF THIS CAR BEING IN A CRASH W/ AIR BAG DEPLOYMENT.  IT STARTED OUT SMALL AND HAS GROWN IN SIZE NOW. YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THE AIR BAG.   SHE DID TAKE THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER WHERE SHE GETS IT SERVICE AND THEY CALLED AND TOLD HER THAT IT HAS BEEN CUT AND WILL NOT TAKE CARE OF IT. MY DAUGHTER IS 105 LBS AND NO WAY IS SHE GOING TO FORCE THIS TO SPLIT LIKE THIS  SHE WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING TO DAMAGE THIS CAR WHICH IS WHAT THEY ARE INDICATING. SHE JUST BOUGHT IT THIS YEAR AS HER 2001 CAVALIER WAS HAVING TOO MANY PROBLEMS.  THIS WAS HER FIRST ALMOST NEW CAR.   THIS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND HONDA SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THIS UNDER WARRANTY BUT RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE DECLINED TO TAKE CARE OF IT  THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP YOU CAN GIVE US.  *TR",
