I SHIFTED INTO NEUTRAL AND THE ENGINE IMMEDIATELY REVVED TO A FAIRLY HIGH RPM. I TURNED OFF THE KEY AND RESTARTED THE VEHICLE WHICH NOW RAN NORMALLY. THIS RAV4 DOES NOT HAVE ANY OPTIONAL FLOOR MATS AND HAS ONLY 6000 MILES ON IT.  THIS IS A 2008 RAV4 AND, AS SUCH, IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT RECALL. *TR",
