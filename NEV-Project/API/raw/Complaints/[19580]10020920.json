MY HUSBAND NT TO PUT NEW BRAKES AND TIRES ON FOR THE FIRST, THE SHOP COULDN'T GET THE TIRE OFF.  THE REASON--THE RIMS WERE MANUFACTURED ALUMINUM WHICH COOL FASTER THAN STEEL  BEHIND THE RIMS.IT PRODUCES A  SUBSTANCE THAT MAKES IT STICKY,  WHEN IT DRIES. IT CAUSES THE  BRAKES AND TIRES  TO BREAK THE RIM AND PAY FOR THE BROKEN RIM.  I FEEL THAT GMCSHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND FIX THIS PROBLEM.*AK",
