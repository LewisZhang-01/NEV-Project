THIS PART HAS FAILED REPEATEDLY, AND AS QUICKLY AS 1 YEAR AFTER REPLACEMENT BY THE DEALER. I PURCHASED A 1997 LINCOLN MARK VIII WITHIN IN THE PAST MONTH FROM WEISLEDER LINCOLN MERCURY, AMONG THE PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE WAS THERE WAS NO HEAT. THE DEALER REPAIRED THE THE BLEND DOOR, BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT THIS REPAIR WILL BE NECESSARY AGAIN IN SHORT TIME BECAUSE THE CONSTRUCTION/ DESIGN OF THE PART IS POOR.",
