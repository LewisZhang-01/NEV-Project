WHEN I START MY CAR UP IN THE MORNING IT RUNS VERY ROUGH. IHAVE GOTTEN IT DIAGNOSED AND IT IS MISFIRING DRAMATICALLY LIKE 6000 ON ONE CYLINDER AND 1081 ON ANOTHER . I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH AND HAD THIS PROBLEM DIAGNOSED, SEVERAL TIMES, AS HAVING BAD INTAKE VALVES. AFTER DOING MORE RESEARCH ON THIS PROBLEM, I HAVE COME TO FIND THIS IS A RATHER COMMON ISSUE WITH THIS SPECIFIC YEAR MAKE AND MODEL. THIS IS CONCERNING BECAUSE I HAVE HAD THIS REPAIR QUOTED AT OVER $2500.00. I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH MANUFACTURER RECALLS AND HAVE BEEN TOLD BY MULTIPLE DEALERSHIPS TO SUBMIT A COMPLAINT IN ORDER FOR THIS PROBLEM TO BE COVERED UNDER A MANUFACTURER RECALL DUE TO FAULTY PARTS. THERE IS ONLY 80,000 MILES ON THE CAR!!!!!!!!!!!",
