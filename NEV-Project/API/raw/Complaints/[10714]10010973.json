I HAD CONTACTED MY DEALER PRIOR TO THIS (SEVERAL MONTHS AGO) COMPLAINING OF STEERING PROBLEMS (WANDERING), AND THE DEALER INFORMED ME,THEY COULD NOT FIX THE PROBLEM BECAUSE HE WAS RECEIVING PRESSURE FROM DODGE TO STOP REPLACING STEERING COMPONENTS ON THESE TRUCKS.  HE ALSO INFORMED ME, HE HAS A NUMBER OF DOCUMENTED CASES OF THIS PROBLEM--16 OR SO.  THERE IS ALSO INFORMATION THAT THE STATE OF MAINE FORCED DODGE TO REPLACE 20 OR 30 OF THESE VEHICLES DUE TO STEERING PROBLEMS.  I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULD BEGIN AN INVESTIGATION OF THIS ISSUE AS IT APPEARS THAT THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE STEERING OF THIS MAKE/MODEL OF VEHICLE (CHECK YOUR OWN DATABASE).  THERE IS ALSO DISCUSSION ON SEVERAL INTERNET BOARDS ABOUT FORMING A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT OVER THIS.    I WAS ALSO INFORMED TODAY THAT DODGE IS DENYING THAT ANY PROBLEM EXISTS WITH THE STEERING ON THESE VEHICLES AND THEY ARE FORMALLY DENYING THAT THE PROBLEM I EXPERIENCED HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE STEERING PROBLEM THAT I HAD REPORTED.   *JB",
