THE LAST ITEM IS THE MOST IMPORTANT. THE HEAD GASKET PROBLEM HAS ARRIVED. FROM WHAT I AM LEARNING, CHRYSLER IS AND HAS BEEN RECEIVING A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS PROBLEM FOR SOME TIME. THE COST IN THE REPAIR IS SOMETHING THAT CHRYSLER DOES NOT WANT TO BEAR. INSTEAD WILL CONTINUE TO PASS IT ON TO IT'S CUSTOMERS. I OWN TWO OTHER  CHRYSLER PRODUCTS THAT ARE MUCH NEWER AND THEY TOO ARE TROUBLESOME.    *JB",
