THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN SERVICED 4 TIMES, THE WHEEL SENSOR HAS BEEN REPLACED AND THE ABS CONTROLLER HAS BEEN REPLACED, NOW I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT HONDA DOES NOT WANT THE DEALER TO LOOK AT MY CAR UNTIL HONDA HAS A SOLUTION FOR THE PROBLEM.  EVER SINCE MY LAST SERVICE, I HAVE BEEN WITHOUT ABS AND TRACTION CONTROL, IT IS NOT AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM ANY MORE.  WHEN THIS FIRST OCCURRED, THE SERVICE MANAGER STATED THAT THIS WAS JUST THE SECOND CAR WITH THE PROBLEM, BUT AS OF MY LAST SERVICE, HE STATED THAT IT IS A GROWING PROBLEM.*JB",
