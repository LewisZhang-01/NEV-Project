        "summary": "MY 2004 CHEVY TRAILBLAZER WILL NOT ACCEPT GASOLINE. I HAD A 1/4 TANK LEFT AND WENT TO A GAS STATION. TO MY SURPRISE THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT LET ME FILL THE TANK. I WAS FIRST TOLD THAT THE VENT MIGHT BE DIRTY THEN A CYLINDER IN THE GAS TANKS SYSTEM MIGHT HAVE FAILED. THE MECHANIC FOUND A BULLETIN THAT SAID I HAD TO REPLACE THE FUEL TANK FILLER UPPER PIPE AND LOWER HOSE BECAUSE OF VAPORS FILLING UP INSIDE. I PAID FOR GAS THAT ENDED UP ALL OVER THE GROUND INSTEAD OF IN MY TANK. I CALLED THE DEALER TO FIND OUT THAT A BULLETIN IS DIFFERENT THEN A RECALL SO THEY WERE NOT ENTITLED TO PAY FOR IT. I PURCHASED IN 2009 AND GM KNOWS ABOUT IT BUT WILL NOT RECALL IT. WHAT IF IT EXPLODES IN THE GAS STATION FROM THE VAPORS. WHO'S FAULT WOULD IT BE THEN. I HAD NO IDEA AND WOULD NEVER BUY A CHEVY AGAIN. FIRST I HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMING ON WHEN THE GAS CAP WAS NOT PUT BACK ON RIGHT AND NOW I CAN'T EVEN GET GAS. WHAT GOOD IS A VEHICLE IF YOU CAN'T USE IT. I AM STILL PAYING FOR IT. AS SOON AS IT PAID FOR I WILL BE TRADING IT IN. THE DEALER GAVE ME A SMO ABOUT A 3 YEAR 36,000 MILE WARRANTY. WHEN I BOUGHT IT HAD 62,500 MILES ALREADY ON IT. WHY SHOULD I PAY FOR SOMETHING THEY KNEW WAS A PROBLEM BUT WON'T RECALL. PLEASE RECALL THIS VEHICLE. IN READING THE BULLETINS FOR THIS VEHICLE I FOUND THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, THE AIR BAGS, THE FUEL SYSTEM, THE TRANSMISSION, SPEEDOMETER, ETC. HOW MANY PROBLEMS DO YOU NEED FOR ONE VEHICLE OR ARE THEY WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO GET KILLED OVER IT. THE BULLETIN SAYS THAT A SMALL AMOUNT OF FUEL MAY SPIT BACK OUT. WELL THAT IS A LIE. ALL THE FUEL IN THE 1/4 TANK SPILLED OUT ON THE GROUND AND I PAID FOR THE GAS I COULD NOT GET IN THE TANK. GM IS NO HELP, DEALER IS NO HELP. THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS STRAIGHT UP WITH ME WAS THE MECHANIC. I AM GOING TO HATE TO SEE THE BILL FOR THIS ONE. MY TAX DOLLARS AT WORK. I AGREE WHY SHOULD WE BAIL OUT THE AUTO COMPANIES WHEN THEY DON'T CARE WHAT KIND OF VEHICLE THEY PRODUCE. *TR",
