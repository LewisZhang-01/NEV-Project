        "summary": "THERE IS A BAD DESIGN IN THE BUNDLE OF WIRING ABOVE TRANSMISSION WITH PLASTIC RING HOLDING BUNDLE, THIS BUNDLE IS NOT ATTACHED TO ANYTHING ALLOWING MOVE RUB TILL THEY SHORT OUT IN THE CHEVROLET BLAZERS, MINE IS A 1997. MY BLAZER WIRING CAUSED MY TRANSMISSION SWITCH TO SHORT OUT AND  I WAS FIRST TOLD I NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION SO I TOOK IT FOR SECOND OPINION, THE SECOND SHOP CUT THE WIRE FROM THE BUNDLE, REROUTED IT FROM TRANSMISSION SWITCH AND THE TRANSMISSION SWITCH WORKED. OTHER WIRES IN THE SAME BUNDLE CAUSED SHORTS THROUGH OUT ALL WIRING CAUSING A CONSTANT DRAW OF ELECTRIC AND RUNNING BATTERY DOWN. WHEN A FUSE IS REMOVED IT BREAKS THE CIRCUIT AND BATTERY DOES NOT RUN DOWN. THE SHORTED WIRING CAUSED DAY LIGHTS TO NOT WORK, INTERIOR LIGHTS TO STAY ON UNLESS I PULLED THE FUSE AND NUMEROUS OTHER ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS. THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I HAVE HAD IT IN THE SHOP FOR THE SAME THING. THEY ARE NOW DROPPING THE TRANSMISSION TO GET TO THE BUNDLE OF WIRES TO FIX SHORTS AND I AM TAKING PICTURES OF ALL OF THIS. THE SHOP HAD TWO OTHER BLAZERS IN AT THE SAME TIME FOR THE SAME PROBLEM. I WILL ALSO TAKE PICTURES OF THOSE BLAZERS, ONE OF THE BLAZERS IS THE SHOP OWNERS WIFE. THE SHOPS ARE TELLING ME IT SHOULD BE A RECALL. I PLAN TO REPORT THIS TO AS MANY AGENCIES AS POSSIBLE AND INTERVIEW AS MANY SHOPS AS POSSIBLE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, I BELIEVE IT IS A FIRE HAZARD SINCE IT SHORTS OUT. THE WIRING BUNDLE IS ALSO CONNECTED TO THE FUEL PUMP AT THE GAS TANK. I HOPE CHEVROLET WILL ACT SOON AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PROBLEM. THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THIS.  I HAVE ALSO HAD IT IN NIX CHEVROLET WHERE I BOUGHT IT AND THE AC DID NOT WORK, THEY HAVE WORKED ON THE AC 8 TIMES AND TOTALLY REBUILT EVERYTHING AND I STILL DO NOT HAVE AC???? THEY SAID THEY WILL LOOK AT IT AGAIN. I ALSO HAVE NUMEROUS RECALLS I WILL HAVE TO HAVE FIXED. I HAVE HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE WITH THIS VEHICLE SINCE I BOUGHT IT, IT'S BEEN IN THE SHOP MORE THAN I HAVE GOT TO DRIVE IT. I WILL NEVER BUY CHEVROLET AGAIN.*AK",
