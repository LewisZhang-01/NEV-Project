I DO USE THE TRUCK FOR WORK SO IT IS HARD TO BRING THE TRUCK INTO THE DEALER UNLESS IT IS SOMETHING WORTH TAKING IT OFF THE ROAD FOR A FEW DAYS.  IN MARCH OF 2001 THE TRUCK HAD TO GO TO THE DEALER FOR SOME SERVICE AND RECALL WORK SO I POINTED OUT THE PAINT PROBLEM AND THEY COULD DO ANYTING ABOUT IT. THEY SAID IT IS NOT COVERED. NOW IT IS SO BAD THAT I HAVE TO GET IT FIXED. THEIR SERVICE MANAGER HAS SAID HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING BUT EVER TIME I GET A MINUTE TO CALL HE IS NEVER AROUND AND HE DOES NOT RETURN MY CALLS.  SO I AM FILLING OUT THIS REPORT TO SEE IF THERE IS A RECALL ON THE PAINT OF THE 1995 DODGE 3500 AND IF THERE IS WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE THE DEALER HONOR THE RECALL...THANK YOU.",
