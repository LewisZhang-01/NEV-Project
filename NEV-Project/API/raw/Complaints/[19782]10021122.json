THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT IT WAS AN AFTERMARKET HANDSFREE KIT I HAD ADDED TO THE CAR.  BUT I PURCHASED THE CAR IN JANUARY AND HAD THE KIT ADDED IN LATE FEBRUARY, AND HAD NO PROBLEMS UP UNTIL A COUPLE WEEKS AGO (LATE MAY).  THE DEALER UNHOOKED THE HANDSFREE KIT, BECAUSE THEY SAID THAT THE AFTERMARKET PRODUCT WAS THE PROBLEM.  AFTER HAVING THE KIT UNHOOKED FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS NOW, I STILL EXPERIENCE THE PROBLEM.  THE KIT IS NOT EVEN HOOKED INTO THE CARS WIRING ANYWHERE, IT IS WIRED ONTO THE BATTER DIRECTLY.  THE PHONE IS NOT EVEN IN THE KIT WHILE THE CAR IS STARTING, AND THE KIT PULLS NO POWER UNLESS THE PHONE IS IN IT.",
