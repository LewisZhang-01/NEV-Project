        "summary": "HELLO,  3/4/2015    MY BROTHER BOUGHT A 2013 JEEP COMPASS ON HIS BIRTHDAY OF THE SAME YEAR.  OVER THE LAST FEW (4-6) MONTHS, WE HAVE CUT OUR FINGERS, REPEATEDLY ON THE CHROME COVERING THE DOORS HANDLES. WE ARE NOT TALKING PAPER CUTS NOR ARE WE DESCRIBING EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS, WE ARE DESCRIBING A VERY DEEP AND OPEN SLICE, MOSTLY TO THE NERVES OF OUR FINGER TIPS, CAUSING ME TO MISS WORK. FURTHERMORE, I HAVE A COMPROMISED IMMUNE SYSTEM (HIV) & MY BODIES ABILITY TO REPAIR AND HEAL IS MUCH LONGER THAN OTHERS. MY MOST RECENT INJURY HAS CAUSE DANGEROUS COMPLICATIONS WITH A HIGH FEVER, LEADING TO A VERY STRESSFUL MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WELL BEING.    I THOUGHT I WOULD MENTION THIS TO EVERYONE,   ONLY BECAUSE I WAS INDEED, IN NEED OF A COMPASSIONATE CSR, INSTEAD I WAS BRUSHED OFF WITH A CASE NUMBER AND A SUGGESTION TO REPAIR THE HANDLES AND ANY OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE, WOULD BE REIMBURSED. I'VE MADE ATTEMPT AFTER ATTEMPT AND NO ONE WITH CHRYSLER HAS EVER KEPT THEIR WORD TO CALL ME BACK............ WELL, IT DID NOT TAKE VERY LONG ( THE VERY NEXT DAY), THAT I SLICED ANOTHER FINGER CAUSING  ANOTHER TRAUMATIC ATTACK ON MY NERVOUS SYSTEM, MOSTLY BECAUSE PRESCRIBED BLOOD THINNERS AND BLEEDING WOUNDS ARE VERY FRIGHTENING AND NOT EASY TO CONTROL.    I'M AFRAID TO SAY, I FEEL, I'VE BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE...........     IN MY CASE, HOWEVER, THIS WAS NOT MY GREATEST DISAPPOINTMENT, BUT TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS BEEN.    I HOPE THAT MY INFLUENCE CAN PREPARE OTHER CONSUMERS WITH THEIR COMPLAINTS TO BE PATIENT AND STEADFAST IN DOCUMENTING ALL DISCUSSIONS WITH NAMES, DATES AND TIMES. MORE IMPORTANTLY RESEARCH VERY CAREFULLY YOUR NEXT AUTOMOBILE PURCHASE.     GREAT MPG ARE NOT THE ONLY NECESSITATES OF BUYING A VEHICLE.     BE ABSOLUTELY, SURE THAT YOU CAN TRUST IN THE MANUFACTURER AND THEIR REPUTATION.    GOOD DAY ALL,    [XXX]  FOREST FALLS, CA.
