THE SECOND TIME WHICH OCCURRED 1-1/2 YEARS LATER, THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT IT COULD POSSIBLE BE A VALVE OR A CYLINDER PROBLEM WHICH DOESN'T ALLOW FLUID TO THE BRAKES.  THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS.  MY WHEEL GETS EXTREMELY HOT AND SO DOES MY TIRE.  THE VEHICLE PULLS EXTREMELY HARD TO THE RIGHT AND SMOKES EMERGES FROM THE WHEEL.  I AM AFRAID THAT MY TIRE COULD POP IF THIS OCCURS AGAIN.  I CONSIDER THIS TO BE A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM AND I WILL NOT DRIVE MY TRUCK UNTIL I GET SOME EXPLANATION FROM FORD ON THIS PROBLEM.  THE SECOND TIME THIS HAPPENED WAS 5/25/2003.  IT OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE FREEWAY AT 65 MPH.  VERY UNSAFE...  CAN YOU HELP ME?   *NLM",
