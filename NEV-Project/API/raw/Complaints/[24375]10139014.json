WHEN I FILL MY GAS TANK, IT SEEMS AS IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF \"VAPOR LOCK\" OR SOMETHING THAT KEEPS CAUSING THE GAS PUMP TO KICK OFF.....I HAVE TO REPOSITION THE HOSE AND TRY VARYING AMOUNTS OF PRESSURE ON THE NOZZLE TO GET THE GASOLINE TO FLOW INTO THE TANK.  ON OCCASION, GAS HAS SPEWED BACK OUT OF THE TANK FROM THE NOZZLE.  IT SEEMS TO BE WORSE WHEN THE TANK IS NEAR EMPTY OR I'VE BEEN DRIVING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.   *NM",
