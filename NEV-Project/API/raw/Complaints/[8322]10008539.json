THERE IS NO DRAIN TUBE TO DRAIN ANY ACID OVERFLOW DOWN UNDER THE CAR. THE ACID BURNED THROUGH THE JUNCTION AND SHORTED OUT THE MAIN HARNESS TO ALL THE LIGHTING ON THE FRONT OF THE CAR. IF THIS HAD BEEN AT NIGHT I WOULD HAVE LOST MY HEADLIGHTS AND TURN SIGNALS. THERE IS MINOR DAMAGE TO TORQUE CONVERTER HOUSING AND MOTOR MOUNT. I'M WAITING NOW TO HEAR FROM THE DEALER AS TO WHEN THE CAR WILL BE RETURNED TO ME AFTER THE REPAIRS ARE DONE, AND SEE IF CHEVROLET WILL TAKE CARE OF THE REPAIRS. IT IS MY BELIEF THEY NEED TO INSTALL A DRAIN TUBE IN THE BATTERY BOX AND REROUTE THIS HARNESS AWAY FROM THIS AREA. I FEAR AS TO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THIS HAD BEEN AT NIGHT AND I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. THIS BATTERY WAS THE ONE THAT CAME WITH THE CAR. *****DIMS 11 IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*****769324. *AK *JB",
