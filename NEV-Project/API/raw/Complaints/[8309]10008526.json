A FORD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE HAS INSPECTED IT AND CLAIMS THE TRACK ITSELF IS DAMAGED AND AS A RESULT, THE MOTOR IS BURNED OUT.  ESTIMATED COST TO REPAIR IS MORE THAN $500.  THERE ARE A NUMBER IF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS IN THE NHTSA DATABASE, INCLUDING AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BY FORD SERVICE PERSONAL THAT THE PROBLEM IS WIDE SPREAD.  IT IS AN UNSAFE SITUATION, AS THE DRIVER IS NOT SECURELY STRAPPED IN, EVEN WHEN FASTENING THE BELT MANUALLY, BECAUSE IT IS TOO FAR FROM THE SHOULDER TO PROTECT THE DRIVER IN A COLLISION.   *JB    ****DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****769306",
