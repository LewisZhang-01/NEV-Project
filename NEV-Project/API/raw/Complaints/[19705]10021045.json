EXTENDED WARRANTY COMPANY IS GIVING THE DEALER A HARD TIME ABOUT FIXING THE PROBLEM.  LOOKS LIKE THE CAR WILL NEED A NEW ENGINE.  VERY DISGUSTED WITH CHRYSLER AND THEIR LACK OF OWNERSHIP ON A PROBLEM THEY KNOW OCCURS (FRIEND IS A MECHANIC FOR DODGE, SAYS THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM THAT CHRYSLER IS AWARE OF).  I HAVE A SMALL CHILD AND FORTUNATELY THE ENGINE DIED IN THE DRIVEWAY AND NOT ON THE HIGHWAY WITH HIM IN THE CAR.  DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK OF THE TRAGEDY THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED.  CHRYSLER NEEDS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ENGINE TROUBLES.  I HAVE BEEN READING A LOT OF POSTINGS AND THIS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON PROBLEM.  IT LOOKS LIKE IT HAPPENS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT.  BOUGHT THIS CAR USED IN 2003, STILL OWE 3 YEARS OF PAYMENTS.   *NLM",
