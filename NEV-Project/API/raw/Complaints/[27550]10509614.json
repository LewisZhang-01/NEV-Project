I COULD NOT ACCELERATE OR ANYTHING ELSE FOR THAT MATTER.  I COASTED TO THE EMERGENCY LANE.  I PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND RESTARTED THE ESCAPE AND WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT HOME.  I HAD READ ABOUT NUMEROUS OTHER RELATED ISSUES ON THIS PROBLEM WITH THE FORD ESCAPE.  I AM GLAD I WAS IN THE RIGHT HAND LAND AND NOT THE LEFT LANE; IT COULD HAVE BEEN VERY DANGEROUS.  *TR",
