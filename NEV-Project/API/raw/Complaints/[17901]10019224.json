THE SECOND TRANSMISSION FAILED AT 81,000 MILES IN 05/03 WAS TOLD WARRANTY WAS EXPIRED (ONLY GOOD FOR 24,000 MILES). I HAD TO PAY $2900 TO HAVE TRANSMISSION REBUILT. 3 TRANSMISSIONS IN A CAR WITH LESS THEN 100,000 MILES SEEMS VERY EXCESSIVE TO ME. WAS TOLD BY AT LEAST 6 DIFFERENT TRANSMISSION REPAIR SHOPS THAT FORD WINDSTAR'S WAS THE NUMBER 1 AUTO THEY REPLACED TRANSMISSIONS ON. SEVERAL SHOPS TOLD ME FORD WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND HAVE RECENTLY FOUND THE PROBLEM AND VANS MADE AFTER 02/03 HAD THE DEFECT FIXED BUT FORD WAS NOT PUTTING A RECALL ON THIS KNOWN PROBLEM.    *NLM",
