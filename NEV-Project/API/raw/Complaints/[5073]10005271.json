        "summary": "I OWN A 2000 MERCEDES BENZ ML 320.  WHILE MY WIFE WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE ON FEBRUARY 1, 2003, THE ENGINE QUIT TWICE WITHOUT WARNING AND THE VEHICLE LOST ALL ELECTRICAL POWER AND STEERING AND BRAKING CONTROL.  THE FIRST FAILURE HAPPENED AS SHE ACCELERATED FROM A STOP AT AN INTERSECTION.  THE SECOND FAILURE OCCURRED SHORTLY THEREAFTER WHILE DRIVING DOWN A STREET.  SHE HAD TO RUN INTO THE CURB TO STOP THE VEHICLE.    I HAVE TALKED TO ANOTHER OWNER OF A ML 320 THAT EXPERIENCED AN ENGINE SHUTDOWN WITHOUT WARNING WHILE DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY.  I HAVE ALSO FOUND MANY COMPLAINTS ON WEBSITES BY OWNERS OF ML 320S THAT REPORTED LOSS OF ENGINE POWER WITHOUT WARNING.  FROM MY LIMITED RESEARCH I WAS ABLE TO FIND OTHER INSTANCES OF THIS OCCURRING, AND FEEL THAT THIS MAY BE A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM AND MAY REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC SAFETY HAZARD.",
