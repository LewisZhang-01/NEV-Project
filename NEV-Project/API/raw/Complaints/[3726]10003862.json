THE IDLE AIR CONTROL MOTOR FAILED WHICH CAUSED THE VEHICLE NOT TO IDLE AND STALL IF THE CONSUME DID NOT DRIVE WITH ONE FOOT ON THE BRAKE AND THE OTHER ON THE ACCELERATOR. THE DEALER SUGGESTED REPLACING THE PART, BUT NOT UNDER ANY WARRANTY. THE CONSUMER DISCOVERED THAT IF HE TAPS ON THE COMPONET IT WILL WORK FOR AWHILE.   ALSO THE LOWER TRIM ON THE WINDSHIELD VIBRATED AND THE CONSUMER HAD TO PLACE A CARD BOARD BOX BETWEEN THE TRIM AND THE WINDSHIELD TO STOP THE NOISE.  THE RIGHT PASSENGER WINDOW WILL NOT OPERATE WHEN THE SUN HEATS UP AND SHINES ON THAT SIDE OF THE VEHICLE WHEN THE VEHICLE IS PARKED. THE DEALER INSPECTED AND GREASED THE TRACK, BUT THE PROBLEM CONTINUED.  THE CONSUMER BELIEVED IT WAS AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE, BECAUSE AS SOON AS THE DOOR COOLS OFF AND IS PARKED IN THE SHADE, THE WINDOW OPERATED FINE. *JB",
