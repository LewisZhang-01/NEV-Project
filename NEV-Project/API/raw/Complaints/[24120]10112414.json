        "summary": "I OWN A 2001 JEEP CHEROKEE SPORT. I HAVE HAD SEVERAL ISSUES SUCH AS BRAKES/ROTORS THAT I HAVE TAKEN CARE OF WITHOUT COMPLAINT. HOWEVER MY JEEP WAS JUST DIAGNOSED WITH A FRONT DIFFERENTIAL FAILURE AND NEEDS A COMPLETE OVERHAUL. MY CAR HAS ONLY 60,000 MILES ON IT AND I HAVE HAD THE FRONT AND REAR DIFFERENTIALS SERVICED TWICE EACH ACCORDING TO THE SPECS IN MY OWNER'S MANUAL. I'VE BEEN TOLD BY PRIVATE MECANICS AS WELL AS JEEP TECHNICIANS THAT THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE OCCURED. CHRYSLER TOLD ME AFTER I HAD IT DIAGNOSED BY MY PERSONAL MECHANIC TO HAVE IT CHECKED BY MY DEALERSHIP. IF THE DEALERSHIP CAME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION I WAS ASSURED THAT MY WARRANTY WOULD BE EXTENDED TO COVER THE REPAIR. NOW CHRYSLER IS REFUSING THE REPAIR AND WILL NOT RETURN MY CALLS. I HAVE BEEN GIVEN AT LEAST FALSE INFORMATION AND HAVE MOST LIKELY BEEN LIED TO. I'VE ALREADY PAID ALMOST $200 FOR THE DIAGNOSTICS AND NOW AM BEING QUOTED ANOTHER $925 FOR THE REPAIR BY THE DEALER. I STILL HAVE OVER A YEAR LEFT ON THE NOTE FOR THIS VEHICLE AND AM APPALLED THAT I AM ALREADY PAYING TO HAVE A MAJOR DRIVETRAIN COMPONENT REBUILT. CHRYSLER HAS DONE NOTHING TO REMEDY THIS. *AK",
