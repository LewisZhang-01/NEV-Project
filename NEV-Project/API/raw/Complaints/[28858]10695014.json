HAD A MECHANIC CHECK POWER STEERING FLUID AND FOUND NO NEED, FLUID LEVEL WAS FINE.  POWER STEERING OUTAGES CONTINUE TO HAPPEN INTERMITTENTLY AND WITHOUT NOTICE UNTIL FINALLY GOING OUT COMPLETELY IN MARCH 2015.  POWER STEERING IS ON AT START-UP OF VEHICLE THEN GOES OUT IN FIRST MINUTE OR TWO OF DRIVING. CHEVROLET DEALER REPLACED POWER STEERING TORQUE SENSOR @ $470.  THERE IS A RECALL FOR THIS SAME ISSUE IN THE PREVIOUS MODEL YEAR BUT WAS TOLD MY CAR IS NOT COVERED.  THE CAR ONLY HAS 55,000 MILES.    ENGINE: (2014) ENGINE BLOCK CRACKED AFTER 5 MINUTE DRIVE TO WORK WITH ONLY 35,000 MILES ON THE CAR.  MECHANIC SAID THEY HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.  ALL FLUID LEVELS WERE FINE AND THERE WAS NO APPARENT REASON FOR THIS TO HAPPEN.  BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS A 2007 THE WARRANTY WAS EXPIRED.  PAID $2000 FOR A USED ENGINE TO BE INSTALLED!  NOW PAYING FOR THE \"NOT COVERED\" POWER STEERING ISSUE. PERHAPS IT'S TIME TO BUY A DIFFERENT MAKE OF VEHICLE.    *TR",
