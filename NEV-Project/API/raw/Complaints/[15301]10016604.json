KIA DID NOT CONSIDER THIS A DEFECT, SO I HAD TO PURCHASE A NEW RIM FOR 98.00, AND HAVE IT MOUNTED AT ADDITIONAL COST.  I SPOKE WITH THE DEALER, AND KIA DIRECTLY ABOUT THIS BEING A SAFETY CONCERN.  KIA'S RESPONSE WAS SINCE IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, THEY WOULD ONLY COVER MANUFACTURING DEFECTS.  THE 13 INCH STEEL RIM HAS NO DAMAGE WHICH WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE TEAR IN THE STEEL; CIRCUMFERENCE WITH THE LUG BOLT HOLES.   *NLM",
