IF SEAT IS NOT LOCKED INTO THIS POSITION IT WILL SLIDE FORWARD OR BACKWARDS FREELY DEPENDING ON THE  MOTION OF THE VEHICLE . MANY ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM BY THE DEALERSHIP, BUT ALL EFFORTS HAVE BEEN FUTILE. NOW THEY AND CHEVROLET REFUSE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM UNDER THE WARRANTY BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT MILEAGE ON THE VEHICLE. AS OF NOW, THERE HAS ONLY BEEN ONE INJURY CAUSED BY THIS SEAT AND THAT WAS TO A 6 YEAR OLD WHOSE FOOT WAS CAUGHT BY THE SEAT WHEN IT WAS BEING SLAMMED INTO THE FULLY BACK POSITION. LUCKILY HER FOOT WAS JUST BRUISED BY THE SEAT . I JUST DO NOT WANT TO SEE ANYONE SERIOUSLY HURT BECAUSE OF THIS MALFUNCTIONING SEAT. THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD FIX THIS PROBLEM AS I HAVE ATTEMPTED ON NUMEROUS(AT LEAST 5) TIMES TO HAVE IT FIXED DURING THE WARRANTY PERIOD. EACH TIME I HAD TO TAKE OFF FROM WORK AND WAIT ON THEM TO FIX IT, MADE TO DEPEND ON THE DEALER TO DRIVE ME TO WORK AND PICK ME UP.  *JB  *NLM     *DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS**76447",
