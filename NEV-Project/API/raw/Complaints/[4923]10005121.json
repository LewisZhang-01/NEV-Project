        "summary": "I  HAD A 2002 VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT FOR LESS THAN SIX MONTHS NOW.  I  HAD THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT GO ON THREE TIMES NOW.      1) THE FIRST TIME THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A LOOSE HOSE ON MY ENGINE.    2) THE NEXT TIME IT WAS ONE OF MY IGNITION COILS.  THE CAR SPUTTERED AND WAS UNDRIVEABLE.  WE HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALER ON CHRISTMAS EVE AND WE WERE WITHOUT OUR CAR FOR 3 DAYS.  3) NEXT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WENT ON IT WAS ANOTHER IGNITION COIL.  AGAIN THE CAR SPUTTERED AND HESITATED UNLESS IT WAS GIVEN A LOT OF GAS.  I FELT THE CAR WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND TOOK IT TO THE DEALER IMMEDIATELY.  LUCKILY I WAS ONLY A MILE AWAY.  THIS TIME IT WAS A DIFFERENT IGNITION COIL.     BOTH TIMES THE IGNITION COIL WENT BAD IT WAS A DIFFERENT ONE.  I HAVE FOUR OF THESE IN MY CARE WHICH MEANS I WILL HAVE THIS PROBLEM AT LEAST TWO MORE TIMES.   THE SERVICE MANAGER TOLD ME THAT VW WAS NOT REPLACING ALL OF THEM BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO PRODUCE ENOUGH OF THEM TO KEEP THE CARS ON THE ROAD.  THIS IS AN UNACCEPTABLE EXCUSE IN MY BOOK.  THIS IS A BRAND NEW CAR WITH A KNOWN PROBLEM THAT VW IS GETTING AWAY WITH. I ALSO EXPRESSED MY CONCERN ABOUT BEING STRANDED WITH THIS CAR SOMEWHERE THE NEXT TIME THIS HAPPENS AND THE SERVICE MANAGER JUST DISMISSED ME.  WE CALLED VW AND THEY GAVE US THE SAME LACK OF CONCERN ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  WE TOLD THEM ALL THE ISSUES WE HAVE HAD AND THEY SHOWED THEIR CONCERN BY ASSIGNING US A CASE NUMBER AND TELLING US TO CALL BACK WHEN IT HAPPENS AGAIN.  I GUESS AFTER THEY MAKE A SALE ALL I AM IS DATA TO THEM.  THEY DON'T FEEL OBLIGATED TO MAKE MY CAR WORK CORRECTLY.    *JB",
