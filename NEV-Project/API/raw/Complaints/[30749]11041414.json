        "summary": "TWO MONTH OLD 2017 GMC ACADIA DENALI FWD.    HORN IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO OPERATE UNDER ANY CONDITIONS.  IT TAKES TWO HANDS TO MAKE IT WORK AND ONLY WITH EXCESSIVE FORCE, AND IN ONLY ONE SPOT ON THE STEERING WHEEL.   RECENTLY I WAS ALONGSIDE OF A BIG RIG AND THE DRIVER DID NOT SEE ME.  HE STARTED TO MANEUVER INTO MY LANE AND THE ACADIA HORN WOULD NOT WORK.  NEARLY CAUSED A MAJOR ACCIDENT ON A 70MPH POSTED HIGHWAY.  THE DEALER KNOWS ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND IT HAS BEEN REPORTED TO GMC AND NHTSA BY MANY 2017 GMC ACADIA OWNERS.  TO DATE, GMC OFFERS NO FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM.  A RECALL OR AT LEAST A REPAIR BULLETIN NEEDS TO BE ISSUED BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT, OR WORSE.  THIS IS A WIDESPREAD SAFETY ISSUE WITH THE 2017 GMC ACADIA, AND POSSIBLY THE 2018 GMC ACADIA IF THE SAME HORN ACTIVATION HARDWARE IS USED IN THE NEWER MODEL.",
