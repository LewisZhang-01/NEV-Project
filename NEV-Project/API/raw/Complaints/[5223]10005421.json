WHAT THE MANUFACTURER OF THE BABY SEATS SHOULD HAVE DONE WAS TO PLACE TWO CLIPS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR SEATS THAT HOOKS DIRECTLY INTO THE CLIPS INSTALLED IN THE NEW VEHICLES.  I HAVE A NEW VEHICLE AND ORDERED A NEW BOOSTER  SEAT, BUT I FOUND THE TOP OF THE CAR SEAT IS SECURE WITH THE TETHER BELT BUT THE BOTTOM IS STILL LOOSE EVEN WITH THE TETHER STRAP.  THE CAR DEALERS DID THEIR SHARE IN TRYING TO MAKE THE BABY SAFE, BUT THE CAR SEATS THEMSELVES ARE NOT DESIGNED CORRECTLY TO FIT INTO THESE CLIPS IN THE NEW CARS.",
