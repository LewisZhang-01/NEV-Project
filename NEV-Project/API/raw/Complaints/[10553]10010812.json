BUT A WEEK LATER, ENGINE VIBRATED AGAIN AND APPEARED IT WAS GOING TO STALL BUT DID NOT.  I CALLED MITSUBISHI REPS IN CALIFORNIA, THEY CAME DOWN TO FLORIDA TO TEST MY CAR.  FOR THREE DAYS THEY KEPT IT AND SAID THEY FIXED THE PROBLEM: THEY CHANGED THE SPARK PLUGS AND CABLES AND TOLD ME TO USE PREMIUM FUEL FROM AMOCO.  A WEEK LATER THE CAR VIBRATED AGAIN AND APPEARED IT WOULD STALL BUT IT DID NOT.  MITSUBISHI SAID THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS CAUSING VIBRATIONS BUT THEY ARE LOOKING IN TO IT.  THEY TOLD ME THEY CAN NOT FIND A SOLUTION IF THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS CAUSING PROBLEM.  I AM VERY FRUSTRATED WITH MY MONTERO.  WILL PROBABLY TRADE FOR BIG AMERICAN GAS GUZZLER.*JB",
