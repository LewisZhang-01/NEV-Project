        "summary": "VAN PURCHASED NEW IN 7/99.  NOW HAS 30,000 MILES ON IT AND FINAL PAYMENT IS NEXT MONTH.  IN DEC. 02, DRIVERS SIDE HEATING ELEMENT WENT OUT.  IN FEB. 03, PASSENGER SIDE WENT OUT.  NOTICED A SMALL BURN HOLE IN SEAT, TOOK IT TO DEALER, THEY WOULD ORDER NEW ELEMENTS, BUT WE'D HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE HOLE.  FEB 24, DROPPED SON OFF AT SCHOOL, DRIVING TO WORK, KEPT SMELLING SOMETHING.  LOOKED OVER AND SMOKE WAS COMING OUT OF THE HOLE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.  PULLED OVER, PUT IT OUT WITH SNOW.  GOT TO WORK, CALLED THE DEALER, THEY TOLD ME TO BRING IT IN THE NEXT DAY!!  WHEN LEAVING WORK, SEAT MOTOR KEPT RUNNING.  TOOK IT TO THE DEALER IMMEDIATELY, ASKED THEM TO PULL THE FUSE SO THERE WOULD BE NO POWER TO THE SEATS.  THEY SAID THERE WAS NO WAY IT DISCONNECT THE SEATS.  WHEN HUSBAND GOT HOME, HE REACHED UNDER THE DRIVERS SEAT AND PULLED THE FUSE.  TOOK IT IN THE NEXT MORNING, SAID THEY WOULD CHECK IT AND ORDER NEW ELEMENT.  ONE HOUR LATER THEY CALLED AND SAID THEY WOULD HAVE TO ORDER NEW SEATS FOR BOTH DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE.  THAT WAS 2/25/03. TODAY IS 6/19/03, STILL NOT FIXED.  DEALER SAYS THEY HAVE PASSENGER SIDE SEAT BUT NOT THE DRIVERS SIDE.  IT IS STILL AT FACTORY.  AFTER 2 MONTHS OF CALLING, THEY HAVE SAID THE FACTORY SHIPPED IT OUT 6/17 AND SHOULD BE HERE IN ABOUT 2 WEEKS.  I REFUSE TO LET THEM PUT THE PASSENGER SIDE IN WITHOUT THE DRIVERS SIDE BEING FIXED BECAUSE I AM AFRAID IT WILL CATCH FIRE ALSO.  CHRYSLER CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE IS NO HELP WHAT  SO EVER.  THEY REFUSE TO GIVE ME THE DISTRICT REPS NUMBER.  THE SERVICE DEPT AT THE DEALER IS NO HELP, THEY JUST KEEP SAYING IT IS ORDERED.  IF IT WASN'T FOR THE PARTS MANAGER, WE'D PROBABLY NEVER GET THE SEAT AT ALL.  FROM THE LOOKS OF THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS SITE, THESE SEATS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECALLED.  THIS IS ONLY ONE OF THE PROBLEMS I HAVE HAD WITH THIS VAN AND DEFINITELY WILL NOT BE PURCHASING ANOTHER CHRYSLER PRODUCT.  THEY DO NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR 5 STAR RATING.   *NLM",
