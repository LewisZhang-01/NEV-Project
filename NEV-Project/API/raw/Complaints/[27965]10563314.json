I OPENED THE HOOD AND SAW GAS LEAKING AROUND TWO METAL CLAMPS ON A SMALL RUBBER HOSE TO THE LEFT AND BELOW THE POWER STEERING FLUID CAP. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AND SEEING HOW COMMON THIS PROBLEM IS, WE WENT OUT ABOUT AN HOUR LATER AND TURNED ON THE ENGINE WITH THE HOOD UP AND WE COULD SEE THE GAS AROUND THE CLAMPS AFTER JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES. WE TIGHTENED THE SCREWS ON THE CLAMPS, THEY WENT AT LEAST THREE TURNS EACH. HOPING THIS SOLVES THE PROBLEM SINCE LEAKING GASOLINE IN THE ENGINE AREA SEEMS PRETTY DANGEROUS.  *TR",
