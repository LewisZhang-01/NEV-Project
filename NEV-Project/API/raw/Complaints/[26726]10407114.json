IF A POTHOLE OR RAILROAD TRACKS ARE HIT AT A SPEED OF AT LEAST 55 MPH THE STEERING WHEEL SHAKES UNCONTROLLABLY. WHEN THIS HAPPENED WITH MY 1995 I SPENT OVER $400.00 IN JUST PARTS REPLACING ALMOST ALL OF THE STEERING PARTS. NOW THIS IS HAPPENING WITH THE 1997. THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE PUBLIC AND IN MY OPINION IS VERY DANGEROUS AND COULD END UP RESULTING IN DEATH IF NOT CORRECTED. I HAVE YET TO HAVE THIS CHECKED OUT YET ON THE 1997. WHILE I UNDERSTAND THAT PARTS WEAR OUT ON TRUCKS IT SHOULD NOT PEOPLES LIVES IN DANGER WHEN THIS HAPPENS. THE ONLY TIME THIS HAPPENS IS WHEN A BUMP OF SOME SORT STARTS THE PROCESS.   *TR",
