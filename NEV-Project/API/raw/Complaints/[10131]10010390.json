I HAVE HAD MAJOR ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS,  BEFORE THE CAR WAS EVEN A YEAR OLD I HAD TO TAKE IT IN FOR TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS 3 TIMES. THEY REPLACED MY TRANSMISSION 2 TIMES. THE SECOND TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT WAS WITH A 2003 TRANSMISSION. I HAVE ALSO TAKEN MY CAR IN 2 TIMES FOR THE ENGINE. MY ENGINE HAD TO BE REPLACED 2 TIMES. BOTH TIMES MY ENGINE WAS FOUND WITH NO OIL IN IT EVEN THOUGHT IT WAS FAR FROM BEING DO FOR AN OIL CHANGE. MY CAR CONSUMES OIL AND I AM CONSTANTLY HAVING TO ADD. THESE PROBLEMS ARE EXCESSIVE AND RIDICULES FOR A CAR THAT IS NOT EVEN A YEAR OLD.   *JB",
