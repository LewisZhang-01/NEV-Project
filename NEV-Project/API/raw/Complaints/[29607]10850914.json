        "summary": "DRIVER'S SEAT LEFT FRONT MOUNTING BOLT ATTACHMENT HAS FAILED.  PROBLEM WAS FIRST NOTICED ON 15 MARCH 2016.  VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY.  AS I WAS SHIFTING AROUND TO GET SEATED I NOTICED A GRINDING SOUND COMING FROM BENEATH THE DRIVER'S SEAT.  EVENTUALLY I OBSERVED THE LEFT FRONT MOUNT LIFTING SLIGHTLY OFF THE FLOOR.  LATER, INVESTIGATING FURTHER (REMOVING THE PLASTIC COVERING) I WAS ABLE TO REMOVE THE MOUNTING BOLT'THERE IS NOTHING FOR THE BOLT TO ATTACH TO THAT I CAN SEE.  WHATEVER HELD THE BOLT ORIGINALLY HAS BROKEN OFF AND IS NO LONGER VISIBLE OR SERVICEABLE.  THIS IS A CRITICAL SAFETY CONCERN FOR ME; ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE I WAS RECENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH THREE BULGING DISCS IN MY NECK AT THE SAN FRANCISCO VA MEDICAL CENTER ON 8 MARCH 2016.  SHOULD I BE IN A COLLISION AND THE SEAT NOT PERFORM AS INTENDED, I COULD POTENTIALLY BE PARALYZED.  THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN.  TOYOTA SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM A SAFETY RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM.",
