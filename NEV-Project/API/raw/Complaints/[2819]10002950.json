TODAY JAN 19,2003 IT IS IN SERVICE SINCE LAST MONDAY AND I HAVE NOT RECEIVED A PHONE CALL OR ANYTHING OF THE SORT. THIS VAN HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM SINCE THE BEGINNING AND NOONE WILL HELP ME. IT HAS TURNED OFF THREE TIMES AND I WENT TO SPEAK TO MY SALES REP TOM ZULLI WHO DID NOT HELP THEN I SPOKE TO MIKE IN SERVICE AND HE DOES NOT HELP AND ROB UPSON THE GENERAL MANAGER WHO WAS VERY NASTY BECAUSE I ASKED HIM FOR A REPLACEMENT VAN OR A REFUND. THE NAME OF THE DEALERSHIP IS NEIL DODGE AT 1788 ROUTE 112, MEDFORD NY 11763. I FEEL AS IF IF I DO NOT HAVE ANY RIGHTS I HAVE REPORTED THEM TO BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS, DAIMLER CHRYSLER NOONE IS HELPING ME. I GAVE A 10,000 DEPOSIT AND I HAVE DRIVEN MY VAN A TOTAL OF ONE WEEK AND I AM GOING ON MY SECOND PAYMENT BUT I DO NOT HAVE MY VAN. THIS LAST TIME I PICKED IT UP AFTER IT BEING IN SERVICE FOR 3 THREE WEEKS THE VERY NEXT DAY IT WOULD NOT TURN ON. WHEN I CALLED NEIL DODGE IT TOOK THEM 3 DAYS TO PICK IT UP AND WHEN THEY DID, I HAD TO CALL MORE THAN 5 TIMES THAT DAY. THEY HAVE HAD THE VAN OVER A WEEK AND STILL NOT ONE CALL. THEY HAVE GIVEN ME A RENTAL IN THE MEANTIME AND ACCORDING TO ROB UPSON THEY DO NOT HAVE TO. IT WAS DONE AS A FAVOR. THE CATCH TO THIS RENTAL IS THAT I HAVE TO PAY $13.00 A DAY FOR INSURANCE SINCE 12/28/02. I STILL HAVE THE RENTAL BECAUSE MY VAN IS STILL IN REPAIRS AND NOONE KNOWS WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE VAN. WHEN I PURCHASED THE VAN MR. TOM ZULLI TOLD ME THE PRIOR OWNER OF THIS VAN RETURNED IT BECAUSE HE COULD NO LONGER AFFORD TO PAY IT. WHEN I CALLED DAIMLER CHRYSLER THEY INFORMED ME IT WAS A RENTAL, OF COURSE THEY GAVE  ME A PAPER SAYING SO, WHICH I SIGNED NOT KNOWING BUT THEY GAVE MORE THAN 10 FORMS TO SIGN HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT I WAS BEING TRICKED. PLEASE HELP ME AS I AM FEELING VERY HELPLESS AND AS IF I DO NOT HAVE ANY RIGHTS AT ALL.",
