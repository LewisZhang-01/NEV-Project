        "summary": "I HAVE A CENTURY CAR SEAT MODEL #45100STH MANUFACTURED ON 09-02-2000.  THE STRAPS CONSTANTLY BECOME UNEVEN CAUSING MY CHILD TO NOT BE TIGHTLY SECURE.  ONE STRAP WILL BE SNUG ON HIS SHOULDER AND THE OTHER WILL BE LOOSE.  WHEN I CALLED CENTURY TO COMPLAIN THEY SAID  IT WAS MY FAULT BECAUSE I WAS NOT PULLING THE STRAPS EQUALLY WHEN GETTING THE CHILD OUT.  I ALWAYS TRY TO DO IT EQUALLY BUT IT IS JUST NOT POSSIBLE.  THEY TOLD ME THAT I NEED TO TAKE THE CAR SEAT OUT AND READJUST THE STRAPS.  THIS IS FINE  BUT I CAN'T DO THIS EVERY OTHER DAY WHEN I AM OUT.  TO SUGGEST THAT I TAKE THE CAR SEAT OUT EVERY TIME TO READJUST THE STRAPS IS UNACCEPTABLE.  CENTURY IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM YET THEY WON'T FIX IT.  HOW MANY KIDS ARE RIDING AROUND IN THE SEATS WITH LOOSE STRAPS BECAUSE OF THEIR FAULTY MANUFACTURING????  I PLAN TO BUY A NEW CAR SEAT IMMEDIATELY AND I WANT OTHERS TO BE AWARE OF THIS AWFUL DESIGN.  I ALSO USE A FISHER PRICE CAR SEAT AND I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM.   *JB",
