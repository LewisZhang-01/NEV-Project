MY MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 73,000 MILES.  FORD KNEW THAT HEAD GASKET HAD PRODUCT DEFECT AND AVOIDED A NHTSA RECALL BY ENTERING INTO A VOLUNTARY REPAIR PROGRAM FOR 1995 FORD WINDSTARS WITH GASKET PROBLEMS IF PROBLEM OCCURS WITHIN 7 YEARS OR 100,000 MILES (WHICHEVER COMES FIRST).  I TRIED TO GET FORD TO REPAIR WITHIN THE TIME PERIOD BUT HEAD GASKET WAS NOT DAMAGED.  FORD SAID I WOULD HAVE TO EXPERIENCE PROBLEM.  I EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEM AT 7 YEARS, 3 MONTHS.  FORD WILL NOT PAY FOR REPAIR.  CAR IS APPRAISED FOR TRADE-IN (WITH PROBLEM) AT $4000 BELOW BLUE BOOK PRICE.  CALLS TO FORD (DEALER AND CORPORATE OFFICE) ARE TOTALLY IGNORED.",
