ACCORDING TO THAT SAME MESSAGE AND A RECALL LETTER MAILED TO US FROM HONDA IN MARCH, 2016, THE DEALER WILL PROVIDE A RENTAL CAR UNTIL THE AIRBAGS ARE FIXED.  I CALLED THE DEALER AND THEY HAVE NO RENTAL CARS AVAILABLE AND THEY COULDN'T TELL ME WHEN THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ONE.  I CALLED HONDA'S CUSTOMER SERVICER AND THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T HELP SECURE A RENTAL CAR BUT A CASE WORKER WOULD CONTACT ME IN ABOUT A WEEK.  THEY'VE HAD NEARLY A YEAR FROM THEIR ONLINE ADMISSION IN MAY 2015 TO MARCH 2016 TO TAKE CARE OF THIS HUGELY IMPORTANT SAFETY ISSUE WORKING WITH THEIR DEALERS TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LOANER VEHICLES.  WE HAVE ONE CAR AND WE'RE NOW AFRAID TO USE IT.",
