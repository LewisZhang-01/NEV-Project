IN JUNE OF 2003  OUR VANS INTAKE GASKET BURST CAUSING COOLANT TO LEAK INTO THE ENGINE. APPARENTLY THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL PLUS TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE THE AVERAGE REPAIR BILL IS AT LEAST 6.6 HOURS LONG JUST FOR THE GASKET NOT INCLUDING ANY DAMAGE DONE TO THE CAM SHAFT (WHICH IS HOLLOW IN THIS MOTOR) I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST GM ON THIS MATTER.   *NLM",
