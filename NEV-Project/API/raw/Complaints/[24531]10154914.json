BUT GM USED SOME VERY CRAPPY MATERIALS WHEN BUILDING THE POWER WINDOW REGULATORS.  THE SYSTEM WORKS FINE UNTIL A SMALL PLASTIC PART THAT HOLDS THE OPERATING CABLES TOGETHER BREAKS.  THIS PIECE PROBABLY COST THE GENERAL ABOUT $.05 TO MAKE AND IS NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH GM DEALERS.  INSTEAD YOU HAVE TO BUY A COMPLETE POWER WINDOW REGULATOR ASSY. WITH MOTOR FOR BETWEEN $ 325.00- $400.00 DEPENDING ON WHICH DEALER YOU TALK TO.  I'M NOW REPLACING THE THIRD REGULATOR ASSY. ON THIS CAR WITH ABOUT 70,000 MILES ON IT AND ALL WERE BROKEN IN THE SAME WAY.  ALL ON DIFFERENT DOORS.  *NM",
