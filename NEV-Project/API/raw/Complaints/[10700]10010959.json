        "summary": "CRANKSHAFT WALK. 1995 MITS. ECLIPSE 2WD TURBO. MY SON BOUGHT THIS CAR DIRECTLY FROM HAVING THE BOTTOM END REBUILT. WITHIN 200 MILES OF DRIVE TIME THE CRANKSHAFT SENSOR WENT OUT. THE MECHANIC THAT DID THE REBUILD SAID HE DID NOT REPLACE THE SENSOR SO NO WARRANTY. AFTER SPENDING ANOTHER 160.00 ON A NEW CRANKSHAFT SENSOR AND INTERRUPTER PLATE. IT LASTED FOR APPROXIMATELY. ANOTHER 200 MILES AND DIED AT 60 MILES AN HOUR ON THE FREEWAY. IT WENT BACK TO THE MECHANIC WHO REPLACED THE CRANK BEARINGS PLATE AND SENSOR. IT ONLY TOOK HIM 8 WEEKS. WE PICKED UP THE CAR ON THURSDAY THE 20TH OF MARCH. THIS TIME IT LASTED 30 MILES AND THE PLATE IS AGAIN HITTING THE SENSOR. WE HAVE NOW PAID ALMOST 3000.00 AND THE CAR IS BACK IN THE SHOP. I HAVE READ COMPLAINTS FROM OTHER CONSUMERS WHO HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. THERE IS NO REASON THAT THE CRANKSHAFT SHOULD BE ABLE TO WALK. AND IT IS NOT FAIR THAT WE HAVE TO PAY FOR A PROBLEM THAT IS OBVIOUSLY IN THE DESIGN. NOT EVEN THE SHOP THAT WAS WORKING ON IT WAS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM. THIS CAR IS BACK IN HIS SHOP FOR THE THIRD TIME. HE IS LOSING MONEY AS ARE WE.  *JB",
