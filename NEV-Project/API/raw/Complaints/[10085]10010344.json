ONE PIECE WAS ABLE TO BE REMOVED, THE SECOND CANNOT BE REMOVED UNLESS THE TRANSMISSION IS REMOVED. THE DEALER INDICATED THIS WAS A NEW OCCURRENCE AND NEVER BEFORE HAPPENED TO THEIR KNOWLEDGE.  THE CONSUMER SERVICE AT HONDA DID NOT SEEM TOO CONCERNED THAT THIS HAD OCCURRED AND SEEMED UNWILLING TO RESEARCH THIS EVEN THOUGH THEY ALSO INDICATED THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME.  *JB",
