BOTH OF THE SIDE PIECES THAT PROTECT HIS HEAD ON EITHER SIDE HAD CRACKED.  WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO PULL THE SEAT COVER FROM THE SEAT BOTH PIECES OF FOAM ACTUALLY FELL FROM THE SEAT.  WHEN I CALL GRACO TO COMPLAIN THE REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME TO WITHER TAPE THE FOAM OR USE ELMERS  GLUE TO RE-ATTACH THE FOAM BACK ON TO THE SEAT.  OBVIOUSLY I FOUND THIS RIDICOULOUS.   WHEN I PURCHASED THIS SEAT I WAS TOLD THE FOAM WAS FOR SAFTEY.  NOW GRACO CLAIMS IT IS FOR COMFORT.  THE MODEL # ON THE SEAT IS 8639BEV AND THE SERIAL IS 110504  IT WASN'T LISTED AS AN OPTION .  *NM",
