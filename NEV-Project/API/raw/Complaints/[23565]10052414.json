THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH LATE 90'S DODGE CARAVAN'S.  I HAVE A RELATIVE WHO HAD THE SAME PROBLEM 2 WEEKS EARLIER.   DODGE DOES HAVE A SERVICE BULLETIN RELATED TO THIS, BUT IT DOES SEEM TO BE SOME TYPE OF DESIGN FLAW THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SINCE IT RELATES TO THE POWER STEERING, AND NEARLY EVERY OTHER VITAL SYSTEM.*AK",
