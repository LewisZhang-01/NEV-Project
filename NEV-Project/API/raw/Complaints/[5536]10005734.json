THIS CAUSES EXCESSIVE WEAR ON THE MAINSHAFT SPLINES, EVENTUALLY LEADING TO FAILURE OF THE MAINSHAFT.  SYMPTOMS INCLUDE EXCESSIVE LASH, AND CLONKING WHEN SHIFTING.  ONCE THE MAINSHAFT FAILS, THERE IS NO POWER TO THE DRIVETRAIN.  THIS DEFECT WAS CORRECTED AT THE FACTORY WITH A CROSS-DRILLED GEAR IN 1997, BUT NO RECALL WAS EVER ISSUED.  THE PROBLEM IS WELL DOCUMENTED ON THE INTERNET.",
