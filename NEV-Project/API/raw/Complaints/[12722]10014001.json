I HAVE BEEN READING A LOT OF BULLETIN BOARD ENTRIES ON WWW.MY350Z.COM AND WWW.ZCAR.COM ABOUT VEHICLES MANUFACTURED BEFORE DEC. OF 2002.  I ALSO VISITED THE NISSAN WEBSITE AND SEE THAT THERE IS A TECH BULLETIN POSTED ABOUT THE WEAR ON THE TIRES.  THERE APPEARS TO BE AN ISSUE WITH THE SUSPENSION SET UP ON THE 350Z THAT IS RESULTING IN EXCESSIVE WEAR ON THE TIRES OR FEATHERING.  THERE ARE A LOT OF PICTURES ON THE WWW.MY350Z.COM WEBSITE OF ACTUAL TIRES.  THE FEATHERING SEEMS TO BEGIN ANYWHERE FROM 5000 TO 10000 MILES.*JB",
