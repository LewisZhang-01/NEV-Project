MY VEHICLE IS A 1999 CHEVY K2500 THAT ISN'T LISTED IN THE RECALL LIST.  THE SPEED SENSOR MALFUNCTIONS 1-4 TIMES PER YEAR (USUALLY FROM DEC THROUGH MAR).  THE FIRST TIME I HAD IT REPAIRED AT THE DEALERSHIP, BUT ON SUBSEQUENT FAILURES DID THE REPAIR MYSELF.  I HAVE ALSO REPLACED THE TAILGATE CABLES MORE THAN ONCE, AND CURRENTLY HAVE A BROKEN ONE AGAIN. *TR",
