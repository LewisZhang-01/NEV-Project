        "summary": "MY LEASED CAR FROM VARSITY LINCOLN MERCURY IS SIX WEEKS OLD, MKZ 2011. PART OF THE PRICE NEGOTIATION WAS THAT THE TIRES WOULD BE INCLUDED IF THEY FAILED.  TIRES ARE NOT USUALLY INCLUDED BUT MY SALESPERSON KEPT STRONG-ARMING ME TO \"INSURE THE TIRES\" AND THIS WAS A RED FLAG SO I KEPT REFUSING AND SUGGESTED I WOULD GO ELSEWHERE. ON FRIDAY, DEC. 10,2011, I CAME OUT FROM THE   GROCERY AND MY TIRE WAS FLAT. I CALLED MY SALESPERSON WHO LAUGHED AND SAID I WAS UNLUCKY.  SHE GAVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL FOR ROAD REPAIR.  WITHIN 40 MINUTES HE ARRIVED AND  HAD MY   SPARE ON.  HE SAID NO NAIL, AND IT COULD BE REPAIRED..FOR SURE.  BUT, THE NEXT MORNING AT THE   DEALERSHIP, I WAS TOLD I NEEDED A NEW TIRE AND IF IT WAS HIM, HE WOULD INSURE THE TIRES. $338.45   LATER I LEFT!!  WAS IT BECAUSE I AM AN ELDERLY WOMAN?  WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR PROMISES??    I CALLED MY SALESPERSON WHO SAID REMINDED ME THAT I WAS PAYING 200 DOLLARS LESS ON MY LEASE   MONTHLY WITH THEM THAN WITH MY ACURA.?   SHE ALSO SAID THAT THE SHE CHECKED AND THE TIRE WAS   SLASHED!!!!!! NO WAY!!!! MY SALESPERSON SAID THE 338.45 INCLUDED NINETY DOLLARS FOR INSURANCE ON   THE TIRES . THE SALESPERSON ALSO REMINDED ME THAT FROM CONSTRUCTION THERE WAS DEBRIS ON THE ROAD.  HER TIRE HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM THE WEEK BEFORE.  I THOUGHT TIRES WWW MADE FOR REASONABLE WEAR ON ROADS.  *TR",
