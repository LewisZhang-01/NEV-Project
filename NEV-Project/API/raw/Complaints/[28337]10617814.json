TOOK TO DEALER THEY FOUND SEAM ON TANK IS CORRODED AND LEAKING. REPAIR IS $2000. TANK ALONE IS $1500. IF THESE TANKS ARE THIS COSTLY, THEY SHOULD LAST MUCH LONGER THAN 6 - 7 YEARS. THIS IS AN UNSAFE CONDITION AND OVERLY COSTLY. I AM UPSET TO FIND THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE AND IS IGNORED BY FORD AS AN ISSUE. THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE COST TO BE SO HIGH ON PART UNLESS FORD IS CONTROLLING IT. FOR JUST ABOUT ANY OTHER VEHICLE, THE TYPICAL COST FOR A TANK IS $100 TO $500. THERE IS NO SPECIAL DESIGN. IT DOES NOT COME WITH ANYTHING EXTRA. NO PUMP. NO SENSORS. IT IS A BARE TANK. THIS SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO CLOSELY AND FOMOCO HELD RESPONSIBLE AND RECALLS SHOULD BE SENT ON THESE VERY UNSAFE VEHICLES.  *TR",
