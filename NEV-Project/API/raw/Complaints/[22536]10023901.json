I CALLED OYSTER BAY DODGE TO INFO THEM THAT MY ROTOR WERE WARPED AND FOUND OUT THEY CLOSED DOWN. I CONTACTED CHRYSLER AND GOT NOWHERE. I LOOKED FOR OTHER DODGE OWNERS AND FOUND MORE THAN I CAN COUNT.  HTTP://WWW.DODGETRUCKWORLD.COM/FORUMS/TOPIC.ASP?ID=56542  PLEASE CONTACT ME AND LET ME KNOW HOW TO RESOLVE THIS. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT I TRUSTED THE FACT THAT IT WAS CERTIFIED BY DODGE(FORGET WHAT TERM YOU USE FOR IT)AS BEING  \"NEW\" AND THEN WHEN I TRY TO GET THE ISSUE RESOLVED, FIND OUT THE DEALER IS OUT OF BUSINESS. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING SINCE I BOUGHT IT WITH VERY UNSAFE SHAKING BRAKES(ROTOR).  I HAVE WELL DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND WILL START TO INFORM ANYONE THAT I NEED TO IF WE CAN'T GET THIS RESOLVED.
