DAVE DOES NOT EXIST. THE ONLY NOTICE I HAVE RECEIVED FROM HONDA REGARDING THIS RECALL STATED THAT HONDA DID NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY PARTS. HONDA WEBSITE STATES THAT I MUST BRING MY VEHICLE IN IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE MY LIFE IS AT STAKE. YET HONDA CANNOT TELL ME THAT IT CAN FIX THE PROBLEM.   ALSO, I NOTICED TODAY THAT THE BOTTOM WINDSHIELD SEAL OR SUPPORT THAT HOLDS THE WINDSHIELD IN PLACE HAS BUCKLED IN NUMEROUS PLACES AND IS ABOUT TO COME OFF ENTIRELY. THIS WOULD PERMIT WATER TO ENTER THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND CREATE A DRIVING HAZARD. IT MIGHT ALSO PERMIT THE WINDSHIELD TO COME LOOSE. I SUSPECT THAT THIS IS NOT JUST MY VEHICLE, BUT IS LIKELY A PROBLEM WITH ALL OF THE HONDA LINEUP. I DON'T KNOW WHEN THIS HAPPENED, SO I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION.",
