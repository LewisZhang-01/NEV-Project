        "summary": "THE PROBLEM IS THE ENGINE STALLS. THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE ENGINE IS WARM OR COLD. IT ALSO HAPPENS AFTER THE CLUTCH HAS BEEN DISENGAGED AFTER BEING AT SPEED AND THE RPMS ARE DECREASING TO THE PROGRAMMED IDLE RPM. HOWEVER, INSTEAD OF STOPPING AT THE IDLING RPM, THE ENGINE RPM DIPS TO LOW AND THE ENGINE STALLS. I LOSE POWER STEERING AND BRAKES WHICH CAUSE A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. I ALSO NOTICED THAT THIS HAPPENS MORE OFTEN IF I AM GOING AROUND A TURN OR TURNING ON THE AC (BOTH ITEMS REQUIRE MORE POWER FROM THE ENGINE)WHILE DISENGAGING THE CLUTCH. IN TOTAL, THIS HAS HAPPENED 5 TIMES DURING THE 30500 MILES. *TS *JB  ****DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12-12-02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS****761876",
