THE ROOF AND HOOD ARE EXHIBITING THE WORST PROBLEMS. I HAVE BEEN ADVISED BY AUTO BODY SPECIALIST INCLUDING FORD'S OWN DESIGNATED, THAT THE PROBLEM STEMS FROM A MANUFACTURING ISSUE. THE CAR OBVIOUSLY RECIEVED TOO MUCH PAINT.  DISCOVERED ON 2/21/03. CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THE PAINT ON THE HOOD HAS BEEN SUGGESTED BY EXPERTS -- COULD BE A SEVERE SAFETY PROBLEM AT SPEEDS. *JB",
