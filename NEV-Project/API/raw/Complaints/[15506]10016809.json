I HAVE THREE SMALL CHILDREN AND MY WIFE AND I ARE IN THIS VEHICLE DAILY.  I CHOSE THIS VEHICLE DUE TO THE COMFORT AND VERSATILITY IT OFFERED.  HAD I KNOWN ABOUT THIS ISSUE SOONER, I HEARD ABOUT THIS ON THE NEWS TONIGHT, I WOULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN TO BUY THIS VEHICLE.  I NOW AM FACED WITH EITHER SELLING THIS WONDERFUL, ALBEIT DEADLY, VEHICLE OR PAYING THROUGH THE NOSE TO HAVE MY DEALER REPLACE THEM WITH GEN 4 MODELS AT FULL-BOAT PRICE!  *JB",
