        "summary": "THIS IS A MODEL WIDE PROBLEM-- FROM WHAT I'VE READ ON FORUMS--  FROM 1999 TO 2009  THESE MOTORCYCLES HAVE HAD A PROBLEM WITH A SLOW WARM-UP COMPOUNDED WITH A SMOOTH RUN OFF CHOKE FOLLOWED BY STUMBLING WHICH COULD LEAD TO A CRASH.      I BOUGHT MY MOTORCYCLE KNOWING OF THIS NATURE... THAT IT WOULD NEED EVEN 10 MINUTES TO WARM-UP TO RIDE.  BUT I READ THAT ONE COULD WORK WITH THE CHOKE TO GET ON THE WAY.   WHAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED IS THAT WHEN ONE STARTS THE ENGINE WITH THE CHOKE ON IT TAKES ABOUT TWO MINUTES FOR THE ENGINE TO IDLE SMOOTHLY WITH THE CHOKE OFF...BUT IF ONE ATTEMPTS TO RIDE OFF AT THIS POINT ONE CAN GO ABOUT 50 FEET AND THE  BIKE STUMBLES AND DIES!  THIS MEANS AFTER A 2 MINUTE WARM-UP ONE COULD DRIVE INTO TRAFFIC AND GET A STALL AND DIE.     AT THIS TWO TO TEN MINUTE TIME INTERVAL ONE COULD RIDE AND FIDDLE WITH THE CHOKE BUT AGAIN THAT LEADS TO  MISFIRING AND OVER EXUBERANT ACCELERATION WHEN THE MOTOR COMES TO LIFE.    I HAVE READ THAT THE OVERLY LONG WARM-UP IS DUE TO TOO LEAN JETTING IN THE MIKUNI CARBURETOR.   I THINK A TEN  MINUTE WAIT TO DRIVE OFF IS UNREASONABLE AND UNSAFE.  MANY CITIES DON'T ALLOW ENGINES TO BE LEFT RUNNING  FOR THAT LONG.  I'M HAPPY WITH THE 70 MILES PER GALLON BUT IT IS PLAIN WASTEFUL OF FUEL AND TIME.  I CAN DRIVE OFF  IN MY CAR WITHOUT ANY WARM-UP.   I ONLY HAVE 650 MILES ON THIS MOTORCYCLE AND KAWASAKI HAS MADE IT UN- SAFE FOR A NORMAL DRIVER.   MY FORMER 1984 BMW MOTORCYCLE SURE DID HAVE A CHOKE AND IT SURE COULD BE DRIVEN OFF IN THE TIME IT TOOK TO GET ON MY HELMET AND GLOVES...    THIS \"COLD BLOODED\" NATURE OF THE KAWASAKI KL250 SHOULD BE FIXED BY A MODEL-WIDE RECALL.  YOU WILL READ SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ON THE YAHOO KL250 SUPER SHERPA FORUM OR IN THE SUPER SHERPA THREAD ON THE ADVENTURE RIDER FORUM UNDER \"THUMPERS\"--SINGLE CYLINDER MOTORBIKES.
