DEALER ONLY REPAIRED THE COILS THAT FAILED. THE SECOND INCIDENT OCCURRED ON 12/26/02--SAME THING; HAD TO HAVE CAR TOWED TO DEALER AGAIN. AGAIN, DESPITE ALL THE KNOWN OCCURRENCES WITH THE COIL PACKS AND PASSATS, ONLY THE COILS THAT FAILED WILL BE REPLACED (AND WHO KNOWS HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE).  I AM EXTREMELY WORRIED THAT THE NEXT TIME THIS OCCURS I WILL SUDDENLY LOSE POWER WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND END UP BEING IN AN ACCIDENT AS A RESULT AND/OR WILL BE STRANDED ALONE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD....I DO A LOT ( ~300 - 400 MILES/WEEK) OF SOLO DRIVING.
