NOTHING UNUSUAL WAS NOTICED AND NO LEAKS WERE DISCOVERED. DROVE CAR LATER IN THE DAY AND SMELL RETURNED, WILL DRIVE MORE AND IF SMELL IS NOTICED AGAIN WILL RETURN TO DEALER. COULD ARISE FROM OIL CHANGES AND IF LEVELING THE FLUID LEVEL THE SPILL BURNOFF COULD BE WHERE THE SMELL COMES FROM...   WHEN STARTING CAR THE ENGINE REVS AT A HIGH SPEED BUT THAT IS NORMAL FROM THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE SO AFTER STARTING I PAUSE A BIT BEFORE SHIFTING AND DRIVING.  OTHER THAN THE ANTIFREEZE SMELL THE CAR IS A PLEASURE TO DRIVE.",
