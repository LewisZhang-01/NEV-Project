        "summary": "STEERING UNIT PULLED AWAY FROM FIREWALL CAUSING LOSS OF CONTROL.  MY MECHANIC TOLD ME THE FIREWALL HAD RUSTED OUT AND ASKED ME IF THE CAR HAD BEEN IN A FLOOD, WHICH IT HAD NOT.  HOWEVER, SHORTLY AFTER I HAD BOUGHT THE CAR NEW IN 1993 I HAD A PROBLEM WITH WATER LEAKING INTO THE CAR THROUGH THE DASH AND ONTO TO THE FRONT FLOORS EVERY TIME IT RAINED.  I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER AND ASKED FOR A NEW CAR.  HOWEVER, THEY SAID IT COULD BE REPAIRED.  THEY DID SOMETHING WITH THE FIREWALL AT THAT TIME AND ASSURED ME THAT EVERYTHING WAS CORRECTED.  THE LEAKING DID STOP.  HOWEVER, AFTER BRINGING THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALER'S BODY SHOP AFTER THIS INCIDENT, I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS UNREPAIRABLE, SINCE THE ENTIRE FIREWALL IS NOW ROTTED OUT AND THE CAUSE OF THIS WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM, WHICH WAS A FACTORY DEFECT.  AFTER ALMOST A MONTH OF WAITING AND GM ORIGINALLY AGREEING TO GIVE ME $1000 TOWARDS A NEW CAR EVEN THOUGH THE STREET VALUE OF THIS CAR, WHICH IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION OTHERWISE, IS $3000, THEY NOW HAVE PULLED THE OFFER.  I SHOULD HAVE STUCK TO MY GUNS BACK IN '93 FOR A NEW CAR!   *JB",
