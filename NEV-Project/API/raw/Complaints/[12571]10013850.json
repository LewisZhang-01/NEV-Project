I HAVE RESEARCHED NUMEROUS OTHER COMPLAINTS WITH THIS SAME TYPE OF GM TRANSMISSION INDICATING TRANSMISSION FAILURES.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.  GM IS TRYING TO PASS IT OFF AS AN UNUSUAL MISFORTUNE ON MY BEHALF.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THESE FAILURES IS NEEDED FOR THE CONSUMER SAFETY AND VEHICLE RELIABILITY.  I SHOULD NOT BE HAVING TO PUT A THIRD TRANSMISSION INTO A 4 YEAR OLD VEHICLE.   *NLM",
