        "summary": "DODGE GC 2001 STALLED WHILE IN MOTION WITH NO WARNING DURING A VERY HEAVILY TRAVELED AREA IN A SCHOOL ZONE WITH MANY POTENTIAL HAZARDS.  LUCKILY I WAS ONLY GOING ABOUT 10 MPHS AND COMING TO A STOP.  I  INTERRUPTED FLOW OF TRAFFIC AT TIME OF FAILURE AND WHEN THE TOW TRUCK CAME. A POLICE OFFICER HELPED DIRECT TRAFFIC.  MECHANIC SAID LEAK DETECTION PUMP WENT OUT WHICH CAUSED THE PCM (POWER TRAIN CONTROL MODULE) TO SHORT OUT. THIS PCM CONTROLS MANY ELECTRICAL ELEMENTS. THE ENGINE LIGHT IS ON, THE SPEEDOMETER AND PASSENGER WINDOW DOESNT WORK AND I AM TOLD THAT SEVERAL SYSTEMS COULD FAIL BUT IT IS DRIVEABLE. I HAVE SEARCHED MANY DEALERSHIPS IN MANY STATES WITH ALL THE SAME ANSWER. THE PART I NEED, THE PCM, IS ON NATIONAL BACK ORDER. THERE ARE NONE AVAILABLE IN THE US. THIS IS THE ONLY VEHICLE I HAVE TO TRANSPORT MY CHILDREN. I CONTACTED DC CORP AND THEY WILL NOT TELL ME IF IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE W/ A FAULTY PCM.  IT HAS BEEN 3 WEEKS AND MY VAN IS NOT FIXED. I AM AT THEIR MERCY AND THEY HAVE DENIED RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL AS A RENTAL REQUEST UNTIL MY VAN CAN BE FIXED PROPERLY. \"UNFORTUNATELY, YOUR REQUEST FOR A RENTAL   VEHICLE HAS BEEN DECLINED.\" THEY CLAIM \"WE ARE UNABLE TO BE OF ASSISTANCE IN EXPEDITING PARTS THAT ARE NOT ON ORDER\" THE PART HAS BEEN ORDERED. AGAIN I QUESTIONED THE SAFETY OF DRIVING THE VEHICLE WITH A FAULTY PCM WITH NO ANSWER AS OF YET. THEIR ARE OVER 250 PCM'S ON BACK ORDER.*AK",
