THIRTY SECONDS LATER THIS SOUND STOPPED AND ABOUT A MINUTE LATER ONLY HOT AIR CAME OUT OF THE VENTS. I'VE TAKEN THE CRV TO A NON HONDA REPAIR SHOP AND THEY ADVISED REPLACING THE AIR COMPRESSOR, CLUTCH, DRYER AND EXPANSION COIL FOR APPROX $1235. THE HONDA DELIVERSHIP ADVISED REPLACING THE ENTIRE COOLING SYSTEM FOR $3350 AND THEN OFFERED A 30% DISCOUNT ( GOOD WILL ) DROPPING THE REPAIR COST TO $2350. *TR",
