INSTALL ON MY 1999 DODGE MINI VAN ZERO EFFORT STEERING, A PAC UNIT ( POWER ASSIST HAND CONTROL) ALONG WITH THIS THERE WERE REMOTE SWITCHES INSTALLED FOR THE LIGHTS, WIPERS/WASHERS & HORN. SINCE DRIVING IT AWAY FROM THEIR BUSINESS  ON 10-16-02 THE BRAKES HAVE CONSTANTLY GRABBED AND THE STEERING WILL CATCH AS YOU APPLY THE BRAKES. THIS HAPPENS WHEN COMING TO A STOP LIGHT AND TRYING TO SLOW DOWN WHILE TURNING THE CORNER, OR IN A PARKING LOT WHEN TRYIN TO PARKL THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN GOING DOWN HILL AND A CHILD WOULD RUN OUT IN FRONT OF ME AND THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WOULD LOCK UP, (I COULD NOT TURN THE STEERING WHEEL WHILE BRAKING AND TRYING TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL TO MISS THE CHILD.)THEY SAY THIS IS A NORMAL PHENOMENON. I SAY IT IS A DANGEROUS THING AND SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED, I AM ASKING FOR YOUR HELP IN STOPPING THIS PRODUCT FROM BEING PUT ON THE MARKET. I HAVE NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT BUT, ONLY BY THE GRACE OF GOD.  I HAVE HAD THE VAN SETTING RUNNING AT AN IDLE SPEED WITHOUT BEING IN GEAR LOCK UP THE STEERING AND THE BRAKES. I COULD NOT TURN THE STEERING WHEEL NOR COULD ANYONE ELSE.*JB",
