I BRAKE HARD, BUT THE CAR WENT UP OVER A CEMENT DIVIDER AND CRASHED INTO THE CAR PARKED FACING ME. I HAD  THE CAR ONE AND HALF YEARS, AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED. I HAD IT TOWED TO THE LEXUS DEALERSHIP. AN INSPECTOR FOUND NOTHING WRONG EXTERNALLY, BUT THE EDR SHOWED I HAD NOT STEPPED ON THE ACCELERATOR BEFORE THE CRASH, ONLY THE BRAKE, AND YET IT HAD SURGED FORWARD. I HAD TAKEN THE CAR IN EARLIER FOR THE RECALL, AND HAD REMOVED THE MAT AND HAD SOMETHING ADDED TO THE SOFTWARE. I SOLD THE CAR BACK TO LEXUS IMMEDIATELY AS I NEVER WANTED TO STEP FOOT IN IT AGAIN. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS CAR, AND SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE ELECTRONICS TO CAUSE THIS.  *TR",
