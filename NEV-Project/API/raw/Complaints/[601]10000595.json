BRAKE PEDAL SHUDDERS BRIEFLY INDICATING ABS IS ENGAGING, THEN BRAKE PEDAL BECOMES SOFT AND DEPRESSES FULLY WITH COMPLETE LOSS OF STOPPING POWER UNTIL BRAKES ARE RELEASED AND REAPPPLIED. CONDITION IS BOTH DISCONCERTING AND DANGEROUS PARTICULARLY ON DOWNHILLS - ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS ACCIDENTS HAVE BEEN NARROWLY AVOIDED OR HAVE BEEN FORCED TO DRIVE VEHICLE OFF THE ROAD SURFACE TO AVOID HITTING OTHERS. PROBLEM HAS BEEN REPORTED TO DEALER ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, RESPONSE IS ALWAYS THAT THIS IS A \"NORMAL CONDITION\" (COMPLETE BRAKE FAILURE??). THIS PROBLEM HAPPENS ROUTINELY WHEN DRIVING THIS VEHICLE - TOTAL NUMBER OF INCIDENCES WOULD EASILY EXCEED 100 DURING THE TIME I HAVE OWNED THIS VEHCILE (ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK FOR OVER A YEAR).",
