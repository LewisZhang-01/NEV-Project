        "summary": "THIS IS REGARDS TO THE MAZDA BRAKE BOOSTER ISSUE FOR THE 2010-2011 CX-9. THIS ISSUE REVOLVES AROUND CUSTOMER NOTIFICATIONS. THE EXTENDED WARRANTY TIME IS 7 YEARS OR 90,000 MILES. MAZDA MAILED OUT A SINGLE LETTER TO OWNERS. MAZDA STIPULATED THAT THE EXTENSION WAS TRANSFERABLE, HOWEVER THEY MADE NO EFFORT TO NOTIFY ANY OF THE NEXT OWNERS, NOT A LINK ON THEIR WEBSITE EVEN. THIS MEANS THAT OWNERS WHO DID NOT GET NOTIFIED WILL NOT KNOW OF THIS ISSUE AND MAY SPEND ABOUT $600-800 TO FIX THE ISSUE EVEN THOUGH IT IS COVERED (OUTSIDE A DEALER). DUE TO THIS BEING A SAFETY ISSUE WITH BRAKES NOT PERFORMING AS EXPECTED DURING NORMAL USE, THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL. ANY SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF BRAKING POWER DURING NORMAL USE WILL CAUSE ANY NORMAL HUMAN TO PANIC. THE NHTSA ISSUED THIS WHILE THINKING AS ENGINEERS, NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HOW THE HUMAN FEELS BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A CAR THAT IS NOT STOPPING. THERE ARE MULTIPLE REPORTS OF PEOPLE NEARLY GETTING INTO ACCIDENTS DUE TO THIS AT HTTPS://WWW.CARCOMPLAINTS.COM/MAZDA/CX-9/2012/BRAKES/BRAKE_POWER_BOOST_UNIT_FAILURE.SHTML AND OTHER SITES AROUND THE INTERNET. WILL IT TAKE INJURY OR DEATH FOR THE NHTSA TO ACT? MY OWN CX-9 STARTED HAVING ISSUES, AND WHEN I TOOK IT IN, THE DEALER STATED THE COST, AND DID NOT EVEN MENTION COVERAGE. I HAD TO LOOK IT UP. MOST PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE. MY CAR IS 2,500 MILES OUT OF THE EXTENSION AND MAZDA WOULD NOT COVER IT. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. IF I DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY TO FIX IT, AND GOT KILLED, WOULD MAZDA BE FORCED TO RECALL?",
