WHEN THE CAR WAS UNDER WARRANTY (AROUND 15,000 MILES), THE SEATBELT MECHANISM WAS RETRACTING VERY SLOWLY SO I TOOK IT IN TO BE REPAIRED, WHICH THEY DID DO AT NO CHARGE.  THE CAR IS NOW OUT OF WARRANTY AND I'M AGAIN HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM.  I CALLED THE DEALER AND THEY SAID IT COULD BE REPAIRED AT MY COST.  IS THIS CONSIDERED A SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD THEY REPAIR IT AT NO CHARGE?",
