I SWERVED DOWN A SIDE STREET AND PULL ON MY EMERGENCY BREAKS AND TURNED OFF THE ENGINE. IT BEGAN AT APPROXIMATELY 30 MPH AND ACCELERATED ITSELF TO APPROXIMATELY 40 MPH.  THE DEALERSHIP DETERMINED THAT MY THROTTLE CABLE WAS ERODED AND NEEDED A REPLACEMENT.  I GOT A NEW THROTTLE CABLE.  ABOUT A MONTH LATER, I FELT THE CLICK AGAIN AND I SAW MY SPEED GO UP AGAIN; THIS TIME, IT UNCLICKED.  I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP AND DROPPED OFF THE VEHICLE.  THE DEALERSHIP DETERMINED THIS TIME THAT THE TUBE IN WHICH THE THROTTLE CABLE IS INSERTED WAS FILLED WAS DEBRIS SO THAT CAUSED ANOTHER JAM.  THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT CHARGE ME AGAIN FOR THIS SERVICE BUT IT LEADS TO ME SUSPECT IF THERE ARE FURTHER ISSUES WITH THE ACCELERATOR ITSELF.  *TR",
