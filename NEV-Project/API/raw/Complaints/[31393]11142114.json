PARKING BRAKE ALSO TURNS ON ON ITS OWN WHEN THE CAR IS ON (STATIONARY ON MINE, IN MOTION ON OTHERS CARS) AND ALSO WHEN CAR IS OFF.   MY CAR WAS ALSO PARKED AND THE BRAKE UNRELEASED AND THE CAR WENT BACKWARDS DOWN THE DRIVEWAY. MY 65 MOTHER WAS HOME ALONE AND RAN OUT AND STOPPED AND HELD THE CAR (AND PUSHED IT BACK UP DRIVEWAY) HERSELF.   FORUMS HAVE STATED THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE AND THE PARKING BRAKE TURNS ON WHEN DRIVING WHICH HAS RESULTED IN CRASHES/ ACCIDENTS AND INJURIES.",
