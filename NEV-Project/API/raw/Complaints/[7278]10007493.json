        "summary": "ON SEPT. 18, 2002, WE PURCHASED A 2002 KIA SPORTAGE. UPON COMPLETION OF PAPER WORK, I QUESTIONED DEALER ABOUT A SEAT BELT EXTENDER AS ORIGINAL INSTALLED SEAT BELT WOULD NOT FIT COMFORTABLY AROUND MY LARGE FRAME. UNLIKE FORD & CHEVROLET, WE WERE TOLD THAT KIA DID NOT MAKE SEAT BELT EXTENDERS! THE NEXT DAY I IMMEDIATELY PHONED KIA MANUFACTURERS MAIN OFFICE, AND AGAIN WAS TOLD THEY DID NOT MAKE SEAT BELT EXTENDERS, THEY COULDN'T HELP ME. I CALLED THE DEALER AND TOLD HIM WE HAD JUST MADE A PURCHASE ON A BRAND NEW VEHICLE THAT NOW I COULD NOT DRIVE SAFELY. HAD WE KNOWN THAT A SEAT BELT EXTENDER COULD NOT BE PROVIDED, WE WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE. WE DO TAKE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY, BUT IT IS STATE LAW IN MISSOURI THAT A SEAT BELT BE WORN WHILE DRIVING OR RIDING IN A MOTOR VEHICLE. THE RAMIFICATION WITHOUT A SEAT BELT IN A CRASH IN FRONT OF AN AIRBAG IS NOT SOMETHING I THINK ANY CAR MANUFACTURER WANTS TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IN A COURT OF LAW SHOULD A CRASH OCCUR AND AN AIRBAG INFLATE. THE BOTTOM LINE: I NEED A SEAT BELT EXTENDER FOR MY KIA SPORTAGE, LIKE CHEVROLET AND FORD OFFER FOR SAFETY WHILE RIDING IN A VEHICLE.
