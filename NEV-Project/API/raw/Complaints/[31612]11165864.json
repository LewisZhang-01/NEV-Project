        "summary": "WHEN COMING OF THE FREEWAY TO AN EXIT TO THE RIGHT I WAS ALREADY SLOWING DOWN THERE WAS A VEHICLE PARKED IN FRONT OF ME ABOUT 1 CAR LENGTHS AWAY, IT WAS WAITING FOR A CHANCE TO MERGE OFF THE EXIT RAMP.I WAS ALREADY SLOWING DOWN AND I HAD THE BRAKES PRESSED, MY CAR WAS SLOWING DOWN BUT IT WASN'T STOPPING AND I PRESSED HARDER BUT IT DIDN'T STOP. THEN I HIT THE OTHER CAR MY VEHICLE STOPPED AFTER THE HIT BUT AS SOON AS THE OTHER VEHICLE MOVED FORWARD TO PULL TO SIDE MY CAR HIT IT AGAIN AND MY FOOT WAS STILL ON THE BRAKE, I PULLED MY E BRAKE AND MY CAR STOPPED. I REPORTED THE ISSUE TO MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE IT IS NOT NORMAL FOR A BRAND NEW CAR AFTER 6 MO THA OF PURCHASE TO DO THAT, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT HAD THE COLLISION BRAKING THING WERE THE CAR BRAKES FOR YOU IF YOU GET TOO CLOSE TO ANOTHER CAR. FIRST THE BODY WORK REPAIRS WERE DONE ON MY CAR THEN MY CAR WAS TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP WERE THEY SAID THEY WOULD TAKE MY CAR PART TO SEE WHAT THE ISSUE WAS AND I WOULD BE CALLED WHEN THEY FOUND OUT WHAT WAS WRONG, I WAS CALLED AND TOLD MY CAR IS FIXED NOW AND IT IS READY FOR PICK UP. I CALLED THE CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE WHICH THEN DIRECTED ME TO THE REGIONAL MANAGER WHO TOLD ME THE REASON MY CAR DIDN'T STOP IS BECAUSE I HAVE TWO FLOOR MATS AND ONE SLIPPED AND BLOCKED MY PEDAL, WHICH WAS CLEARLY NOT THE REASON. I WAS TIRED OF GETTING RIDICULOUS ANSWERS AND SURPRISING RIGHT AFTER ALL THIS HAPPENED MY ANTI COLLISION BRAKING SYSTEM STARTS WORKING BUT NOT DURING ANY COLLISIONS BUT JUST REGULAR DRIVING. I COMPLAINED ABOUT HAT AND MY BRAKES AGAIN JUST RECENTLY AND I WA STOLE THAT MY BRAKE PADS ARE WORN OUT AND ROTORS AS WELL AND MY TIRES. I BOUGHT THE CAR BRAND NEW 2017 AND IT ONLY HAS 28,000 MILES ON IT. I DON'T EVEN DRIVE IT CRAZY OR HARSH. I HAD TO GET MY BRAKE PADS REPLACED AND ROTORS.",
