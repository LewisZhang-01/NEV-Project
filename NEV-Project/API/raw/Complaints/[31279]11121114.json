        "summary": "2013 NISSAN ALTIMA SL WITH 66K. TRANSMISSION NEEDED REPLACED AT 66K MILES. NISSAN DIAGNOSED THE ISSUE. AFTER HEARING IT WOULD COST ME OVER 3700 TO REPLACE I BEGAN DOING RESEARCH ON THESE CVT TRANSMISSION. IT'S A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THESE CVTS. SO WITH ALL OF THE BAD REVIEWS ON THE INTERNET, I INQUIRED WITH NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS WITH ASSISTANCE IN THIS COST. I WAITED A WEEK FOR THEM TO TELL ME THEY WILL NOT ASSIST ME IN THIS REPAIR. NISSAN HAS RECALLED A NUMBER OF YEARS AND EXTENDED THE WARRANTY FROM 60K TO 120K. THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE NOT FIXED THE PROBLEM WITH THESE TRANSMISSIONS. THERE IS NO REASON A TRANSMISSION IS NEEDING REPLACED AT 60K. I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE NISSAN IS VERY KNOWN FOR THE RELIABILITY AND THEIR CARS ARE SUPPOSE TO LAST. AFTER HAVING THIS ISSUE AND HEARING NISSAN WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ISSUE IS VERY FRUSTRATING. THIS IS DEFF A DANGER ISSUE. MY VEHICLE GAVE ME NO INDICATION OR LIGHTS THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE UNTIL I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY WITH MY 4 CHILDREN WHEN IT WENT FROM 80 TO 50 MPH I'M CRUISE. AND THEN HESITATING TO GO AND I WAS AN HOUR AWAY FROM HOME. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THEE TRANSMISSION.",
