        "summary": "MY CAR HAS A ROUGH IDLE/FEELS LIKE IT'S GOING TO STALL WHEN IT'S IDLING. AFTER GETTING A LOW-ENGINE POWER INDICATOR LIGHT, I TOOK IT TO MY DEALER, WHO DIAGNOSED THE REAR HIGH-PRESSURE FUEL PUMP AS A RESULT OF THE CODE DURING DIAGNOSTICS. AT A COST OF MORE THAN $1,300, THE FUEL PUMP WAS REPLACED, AND AS I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM THE DEALERSHIP, THE PROBLEM PERSISTED AND I CALLED THE DEALER RIGHT THEN. I WAS TOLD TO LET THE CAR RESET AND DO HIGHWAY DRIVING. AFTER FIVE DAYS AND A 12-HOUR HIGHWAY ROUND TRIP, I STILL HAD THE PROBLEM AND CALLED THE DEALER BACK. THEY HAD MY CAR THREE DAYS AND NOW SAY THIS IS A TIMING CHAIN ISSUE, BUT THEY ALSO SAY THAT SOME OF MY MODELS ARE HAVING HIGH OIL CONSUMPTION, LEADING TO THE TIMING CHAIN ISSUE; THEREFORE, THEY'RE TRACKING MY OIL CONSUMPTION FOR 2,000 MILES. STILL, MY QUESTION IS WHY REPLACE THE HIGH-PRESSURE FUEL PUMP SINCE THAT DIDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM? MY YEAR, MAKE, AND MODEL--BUT NOT VIN--IS CURRENTLY UNDER RECALL FOR FAILING HIGH-PRESSURE FUEL PUMPS, BUT MY DEALER WON'T BUDGE AND INCLUDE IT IN THE RECALL. THE RECALL IS: #43180: PRODUCT EMISSION RECALL ' HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP ' (SEP 30, 2016). I ALSO CONTACTED GM'S HELP LINE, AND THEY INVESTIGATED AND DID NOTHING. I CAN PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION IF NECESSARY, BUT I'M REQUESTING THAT THE RECALL BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE MY VIN.",
