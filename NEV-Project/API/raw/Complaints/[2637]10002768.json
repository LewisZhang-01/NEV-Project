AFTER 10 MINUTES, THE TRUCK STARTED AGAIN AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE ON.  SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPTS TO START THE TRUCK FAILED RESULTING IN IT BEING TOWED TO THE DEALER.  THE DEALER HAD TO REPLACE ONE OF THE COMPUTERS IN THE TRUCK AND IT HAS BEEN FINE EVER SINCE.  I HEARD ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION FOR THE ENVOY AND BRAVADA BUT NOT THE TRAILBLAZER.  MY TRUCK IS A TRAILBLAZER AND DID EXPERIENCE THE SAME PROBLEMS AS THE TWO SISTER TRUCKS THAT SHARE THE SAME MECHANICALS.",
