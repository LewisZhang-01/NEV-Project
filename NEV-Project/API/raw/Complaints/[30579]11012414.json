        "summary": "THIS INCIDENT WAS 4 MONTHS AFTWR PURCHASE. I PARKED A FRIEND'S HOUSE, AND THE BATTERY DRAINED OVER THE COURSE OF 3 HOURS. I CAME OUT AND START THE CAR, AND IT WOULDNT START. THE CAR KEEP ON MAKING THIS CONTINUOUS BEEPING NOISE EVERY TIME I OPEN AND CLOSE THE DOOR. IT USUALLY ONLY DO THAT IF THE KEY ISN'T NEAR THE CAR, BUT THIS TIME THE KEYS ARE ON ME. THE TRUNK WILL NOT OPEN NO MATTER WHAT YOU PRESS. I HAD TO GET MY FRIEND TO JUMP THE CAR WITH CABLES. WHILE I WAS DRIVING HOME, IT DIDN'T SHOW THE NORMAL SCREEN, BUT IT SHOWED SOME ANTI THEFT MESSAGE. ONCE I GOT HOME, IT TOLD ME TO HOLD DOWN FOR LONGER THAN TWO SECONDS TO HAVE THE SYSTEM RESTART. I DID THAT BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. I LEFT IT OVER NIGHT AND IT WAS NORMAL AGAIN THE NEXT DAY.   RIGHT NOW, AS I'M WRITING THIS COMPLAINT, THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM. AN HOUR AGO, I PARKED AT A RESTAURANT'S PARKING LOT. I CAME OUT 40 MINUTES LATER AND CANNOT START THR CAR. THE DISPLAY IN FRONT OF ME IS SHOWING \"BRAKE SYSTEM PROBLEM. \" I'M WAITING THE THE TOW PEOPLE TO TOW MY CAR RIGHT NOW. IN SIX MONTHS I HAVE EXPERIENCED 2 MAJOR PROBLEMS WHICH CAUSE QUITE AN INCONVENIENCE.",
