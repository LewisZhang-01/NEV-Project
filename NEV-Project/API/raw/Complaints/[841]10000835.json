I CONSIDER THIS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONCERN SINCE THE ACCELERATION OF THE CAR IS UNPREDICTABLE.  THE CAR HAS BEEN TAKEN TO TWO DEALERS TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM, BOTH REPORTING THAT THIS IS NORMAL FOR THE \"FLY-BY-THE-WIRE\" SYSTEMS WHICH IS USED IN THE CAR AND THAT THERE IS NO ADJUSTMENT OR CORRECTION FOR THIS.  I FIND IT TO BE OF CONCERN AND A SAFGETY ISSUE THAT AAUDI SHOULD DEAL WITH BEFORE THERE IS A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.",
