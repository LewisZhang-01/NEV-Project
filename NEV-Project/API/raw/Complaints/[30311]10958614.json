THIS CAUSES THE VEHICLE TO SUDDENLY GO INTO ENGINE POWER CONTROL AND WILL SOMETIMES CUT OFF THE STEERING AND BRAKES. I'VE GOTTEN CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION WITH NO BRAKES AND NO STEERING. I HAD TO USE MY PARKING BRAKE AND SHUT THE ENGINE OFF. MOST OF THE TIME THE STEERING GOES OUT IS WHEN I'M TRYING TO MAKE A U TURN. AND MOST OF THE TIME THE ENGINE STARTS TO MISFIRE AND/OR SHUT OFF IS WHEN I'M TRYING ACCELERATE EITHER AFTER BEING STOPPED AT A RED LIGHT OR SIGNIFICANT INCREASE LIKE MERGING ON A FREEWAY",
