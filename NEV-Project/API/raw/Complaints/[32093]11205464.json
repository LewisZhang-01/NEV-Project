        "summary": "I PURCHASED 2015 KIA SPORTAGE AT PEAK KIA IN LITTLETON COLORADO JULY 2015 NEW 0 MILES. ON APRIL 19,2019 I CONTACTED KIA DEALERSHIP 303-904-7800  BECAUSE THE CAR DASH WENT COMPLETELY BLANK, I SPOKE TO CURTIS IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT SPENT OVER AN HOUR TRYING TO DISCUSS MY ISSUE, I REPLACED MY BATTERY, THE NEXT DAY I WAS DRIVING THE CAR STARTED TO LOSE SPEED, I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR TO PEAK. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAID THEY COULD NOT GIVE ME A VEHICLE TO DRIVE BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT LOOK AT MY CAR UNTIL MONDAY 4/22/2019. I WENT THE DEALERSHIP MANAGER AND FINALLY WAS GIVEN A VEHICLE TO DRIVE. ON 4/27/2019 THE DEALERSHIP WANTED THE LOANER VEHICLE BACK AND PUT ME INTO A RENTAL CAR, MY FRUSTRATION WITH BEING IN A RENTAL INSTEAD OF THE COURTESY VEHICLE IS THAT I ELECTED RENTAL CAR INSURANCE WHICH I AM PAYING OUT  OF POCKET DUE TO THE FACT THAT RENTAL CAR AGENCIES WILL FIND ANY DING OR DENT AND MAKE YOU PAY IF INSURANCE IS NOT ADDED. I FEEL LIKE THE DEALERSHIP SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED A COURTESY VEHICLE BECAUSE I HAD ALL OF THE REQUIRED MAINTENANCE DONE AT PEAK KIA, PURCHASED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY AS A CONSUMER I DID MY PART,  THE PURCHASE OF THIS NEW VEHICLE HAS NOT REACHED THE 4 YEAR MARK? KIA HAS 10 YEAR 100,000 MILE WARRANTY ON THE MOTOR. I WAS INFORMED BY PEAK THAT KIA WILL PUT A REFURBISHED ENGINE IN THE CAR WITH 12,000 WARRANTY AND 1 YEAR SO I AM LOSING MY ADDITIONAL 30,000 MILE WARRANTY AND 6 YEARS OF WARRANTY FROM THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE. THE REASON THAT I PURCHASED A NEW VEHICLE WITH 0 MILES AND COMPLETED SUGGESTED MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS WAS TO ELIMINATE MECHANICAL  ISSUES .",
