THE PREVIOUS OWNER TOLD ME AND GAVE RECEIPTS FROM THE DEALER WHERE SHE PURCHASED THE CAR AND REPAIRED THE TRANSMISSION TWICE. THE FIRST TIME ON 9/19/1999 WITH 45,888. THE CAR WILL STALL AND WILL NOT STAY RUNNING. THE SECOND TIME ON 8/25/1999 WITH 45,932 M. THE CAR WON'T SHIFT WHEN COLD. A THIRD TIME I TOOK THE CAR TO THE SAME DEALER ON 11/7/2000 WITH 51, 627 M. PROBLEM, IT DID NOT SHIFT WHEN HOT. THE DEALER CORRECTED THE PROBLEM BY CHANGING THE SOLENOID PACK.  A FOURTH TIME THE CAR WAS TAKEN  TO THE SAME DEALER ON 4/4/2002 WITH 68,147 M. PROBLEM, THE TRANSMISSION MAKES A BUZZ NOISE WHEN ACCELERATING, THE DEALER DID NOT MAKE REPAIRS AT THIS TIME BECAUSE ON ROAD TEST NO SOUND OR SLIPS WERE FELT ACCORDING TO THEM.  ******DIMS 11 IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****** 770789. *AK    *JB",
