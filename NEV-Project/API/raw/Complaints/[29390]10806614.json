        "summary": "ENTERED LEASE ON 2015 KIA SOUL EXCLAIM ON 2-9-15 WHEN LEASE FOR 2012 KIA SOUL EXCLAIM WAS ABOUT TO TERMINATE. EVER SINCE PURCHASE, WHEN I COME TO A COMPLETE STOP AND AM IDLING AT A STOPLIGHT, THE CAR WILL FEEL LIKE IT WANTS TO GO. I'VE TAKEN THE CAR INTO DEALERSHIP AT SEVERAL DIFFERENT INTERVALS, SO MILEAGE ON CAR KEEPS GROWING. I HAVE TO PUT BOTH FEET ON THE BRAKES AT TIMES IN ORDER TO KEEP CAR FROM TRYING TO ACCELERATE FORWARD. I'VE GONE TO THE DEALERSHIP SEVERAL TIMES AND THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE. THEY HAVE RECENT THE COMPUTER TO FACTORY NEW SETTINGS, MORE THAN ONCE. ON 11-21-15, I TOOK IT TO DEALERSHIP AGAIN AND THEY TOOK ALL SORT OF READINGS AND WERE ON THE PHONE WITH KIA TECH FOR SUGGESTIONS. THE ONE PERSON WHO COULD READ MORE ABOUT THE FINDINGS WAS NOT GOING TO BE AVAILABLE UNTIL 11-24-15. I CALLED THIS EVENING AND THE SERVICE ADVISOR HAD TALKED THEIR TECH WHO HAD TALKED TO KIA TECH AND THEY STILL COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING. I CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING AT A COMPLETE STOP AND POTENTIALLY RAMMING INTO THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. I'VE TRIED TURNING THE FAN OFF OR MAKING SURE THE CAR HAS WARMED UP SO THAT THE FAN DOESN'T HAVE TO RUN TO SEE IF THAT HELPS, BUT IT STILL WILL DO THIS.",
