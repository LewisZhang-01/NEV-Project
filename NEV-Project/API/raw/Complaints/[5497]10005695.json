GRANT HESSMAN OF SAAB CARS USA (SAAB COMPLAINT # 1-57069705), I WAS NOTIFIED THAT SAAB WILL NOT PAY FOR THE PART NOW THAT IT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION BY THE DEALER SINCE MY CAR HAS GONE OVER THE SAAB IMPOSED MILEAGE LIMIT.     IT IS MY INTENTION TO DETERMINE WHY SAAB WILL NOT PAY FOR THIS PROBLEM SINCE IT IS THEIR ENGINEERING PROBLEM AND THEIR INABILITY TO NOTIFY ME OF THIS PROBLEM.  THE CAR WAS PURCHASED BRAND NEW AND I HAVE TAKEN IT TO AUTHORIZED SAAB DEALERS FOR MAINTENANCE SINCE I PURCHASED THE CAR, WHICH WAS CONFIRMED BY MR. HESSMAN.  IT IS DISTURBING THAT SAAB CAN VIEW RECENT MAINTENANCE INFORMATION YET CLAIM THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO MY MAILING ADDRESS THAT HAS BEEN IN EFFECT FOR 6 YEARS.  IT IS THIS REASON THEY CLAIM THAT I DID NOT RECEIVE THE RECALL NOTIFICATION.  IT WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND WHY SAAB CONTACTS ME VIA MY MAILING ADDRESS FOR SALES AND SERVICE MATERIAL YET CAN'T FOR RECALL INFORMATION.",
