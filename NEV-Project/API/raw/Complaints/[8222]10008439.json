I CALLED  CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS TOLD TO WORK WITH MY LOCAL DEALER.  HE CLAIMS THERE IS NO PROBLEM AND IT IS ALIGNED TO SPECIFICATION.  HE CLAIMS THE TRUCK JUST FOLLOWS THE CROWN IN THE ROAD.  I TESTED THE TRUCK IN A FLAT PARKING LOT BY DRIVING BETWEEN ALIGNED PARKING SPACES IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.  IT STILL PULLED TO THE RIGHT.  I DON'T DOUBT THAT IT IS ALIGNED, I BELIEVE THERE IS (ARE) OTHER PROBLEMS.  I CAN'T GET A SATISFACTORY RESPONSE FROM THE DEALER OR COMPANY.*JB",
