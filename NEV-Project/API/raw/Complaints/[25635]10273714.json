        "summary": "DEAR SIR OR MADAM:    ON MY WAY TO WAL-MART ON ROUTE 40 ONE SATURDAY AFTERNOON, A \"POWER STEERING\" MESSAGE CAME UP ON MY 2006 COBALT SS DASHBOARD. THIS WAS HAPPENING AS I WAS INCREASING MY SPEED CLOSE TO THE SPEED LIMIT OF 55 MILES AN HOUR. I ARRIVED TO MY DESTINATION WITH DIFFICULTY SINCE I HAVE NEVER DRIVEN A CAR WITHOUT POWER STEERING AND DRIVING IT TOOK A LOT OF EFFORT TO AVOID CRASHING IN THE PARKING LOT TRAFFIC.    AFTER I SHOPPED AT WAL-MART AND RETURNED TO MY CAR, I STARTED ENGINE AND RELIEVED THAT THE PROBLEM HAS DISAPPEARED. MUCH TO MY DISMAY, I WENT BACK TO ROUTE 40 UP TO 55 MILES AN HOUR AGAIN WITH THE POWER STEERING PROBLEM APPEARING AGAIN. BASED ON WHAT I'VE EXPERIENCED SO FAR, THE POWER STEERING SEEMS TO GET TURNED \"OFF\" DURING A LONG, STRAIGHT-AWAY DRIVE AT MORE THAN 50 MILES AN HOUR ON A HOT WEATHER. IT HAS HAPPENED TWICE TODAY AND I'M CONCERNED THAT IT MAY HAPPEN AGAIN AND AGAIN. THE DEFECT COULD ENDANGER MYSELF AND MY PASSENGERS IN THE EVENT THE POWER STEERING IS MUCH MORE NEEDED, ESPECIALLY IN LOW TRAFFIC SPEEDS. DURING LOW TRAFFIC SPEEDS, IT INCREASES THE RISK OF AN ACCIDENT DUE TO A MORE REQUIRED EFFORT TO STEER.    NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO IT YET AND I WILL BE CALLING MY CAR DEALERSHIP SOON TO SEE IF MY ZURICH VEHICLE CONTRACT COVERS THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING. SINCE GM'S WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED ALREADY, IT WILL NOT BE COVERED.  I HAVE SEARCHED THE WEB AND FOUND THAT COUNTLESS COBALT OWNERS ARE HAVING THE SIMILAR PROBLEMS, WHICH WORRIES ME. GENERAL MOTORS HASN'T STARTED A RECALL FOR THE DEFECT AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THE DEFECT CAN END UP BEING FATAL TO MANY OTHER COBALT OWNERS. I HOPE GENERAL MOTORS ISN'T BEING NEGLIGENT, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THEY ARE UNDER BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION.    I BOUGHT THE 2006 COBALT SS 4 MONTHS AGO USED AND I'VE ACCUMULATED 7000 MILES ON IT WITH AN ODOMETER READING OF ABOUT 67,400. IT WAS A GREAT CAR UNTIL I FIND OUT IT'S PRETTY UNSAFE WITH A RE-OCCURRING POWER STEERING PROBLEM. *TR",
