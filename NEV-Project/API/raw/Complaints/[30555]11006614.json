THIS HAPPENS WITH A SUDDEN JERK AND IS DANGEROUS TO THE OCCUPANT AND ALSO TO OTHER VEHICLES AS IT COMES TO A SUDDEN HALT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. THIS IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE AND CAN EVEN BE FATAL/OR CAUSE SERIOUS INJURIES TO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE VEHICLE AND TO THE OCCUPANTS OF OTHER VEHICLES.  AT OTHER TIMES IT WILL KEEP SHIFTING TO PARK WHEN THE DRIVER PUTS IT INTO REVERSE OR DRIVE WHEN STATIONARY.    TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAY THEIR DIAGNOSTICS DOES NOT SHOW A PROBLEM. WHEN WE CALLED MERCEDES THEY SAY THAT IF THE DEALER CANNOT SEE THE PROBLEM THERE IS NO PROBLEM.       WE HAVE FINALLY BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A VIDEO RECORDING BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE FILE IS TOO LARGE TO ATTACH    DUE TO THE POTENTIAL DANGEROUS OUTCOME WE REQUEST THAT THE HIGHER LEVEL MERCEDES ENGINEERS LOOK INTO AND IN THE MEANTIME THE VEHICLE SHOULD BE RECALLED",
