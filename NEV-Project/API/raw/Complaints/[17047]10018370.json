        "summary": "OUR JEEP CHEROKEE LAREDO (72994 MILES AS OF YESTERDAY 5/6/03) WHILE DRIVING AT ANY SPEED, PRESSURE IS JUST LOST; NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE PRESS ON THE GAS PEDAL  THE SPEED WILL JUST DROP DOWN TO ZERO.  THEN IT WILL TAKE A WHILE TO GET IT TO MOVE AT ALL.  WE HAD TAKEN IT TO THE MECHANIC, NOT BEING ABLE TO PINPOINT WHY (BECAUSE WHEN WE GOT THERE IT WAS NOT DOING THAT) THEY DID A FEW TEST AND A TUNE UP. AFTER A FEW DAYS, SAME THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING AGAIN. NOW WHEN IT HAPPENS IT WILL TAKE 45 MINUTES TO 1 HOUR TO GET IT TO STAY STARTED FULLY (INSTEAD OF ON/OFF). WE TOOK IT TO A JEEP DEALER (SALERNO DUANE JEEP-EAGLE), THEY TEST DRIVE IT AND TRIED EVERYTHING THEY COULD NOT DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS AND SCARY TO DRIVE IT AND FRUSTRATING TOO BECAUSE NO ONE SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO PINPOINT THE PROBLEM. MAYBE WITH YOUR HELP WE CAN GET TO THE MANUFACTURER BEFORE IT GEST WORSE AND THE PROBLEM CAN BE DETECTED AND FIXED. ANY SUGGESTIONS WILL BE VERY HELPFUL AND APPRECIATED.     YOU CAN ALSO CONTACT MY HUSBAND, EXCELLENT OCCEAN, AT WORK IF NECESSARY: 908-918-9547.    REGARDS,  KETTLY M. OCCEAN",
