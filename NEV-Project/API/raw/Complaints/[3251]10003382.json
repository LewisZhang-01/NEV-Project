THE SERVICE CONSULTANT TOLD ME THAT WHOEVER ROTATED MY TIRES USED THE WRONG TORQUE WHEN PUTTING THE WHEELS BACK ON. HE SAID THAT MESSED UP MY ROTORS.  I TOLD HIM THAT I HAD NEVER ROTATED MY TIRES.  HE SAID THAT MY WARRANTY WOULDN'T BE HONORED BECAUSE I HAD NOT ROTATED MY TIRES.  I TOOK IT TO ANOTHER CHEV DEALER AND HE SAID THAT BRAKES WERE NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND IT WAS NOT UNUSUAL TO HAVE TO HAVE MY ROTORS TURNED AND NEW PADS AT THAT MILEAGE.  I HAVE HAD ALL NEW CARS AND NEVER HAD TO HAVE A COMPLETE BRAKE JOB AT THAT MILEAGE.",
