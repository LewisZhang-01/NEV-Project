        "summary": "ROOF LEAKED ON FIRST MAJOR RAIN STORM FROM ALL OVER, CAUSING CARPETING DAMAGE AND CABINET DAMAGE.  I HAD DROVE BACK TO THE DEALER TO HAVE IT FIXED, AND THEY REPLACED THREE WINDOWS AND FIXED THE ROOF VENT AND REPLACED THE CARPET.  THEY DID NOT FIX THE WATER DAMAGED CABINET, THEY DECIDED TO PUT MOLDING OVER THE STAINED WOOD INSTEAD OF REPLACING.  AFTER I DROVE BACK A WEEK LATER TO PICK UP THE CAMPER, I NOTICED IN THE RAIN ON THE WAY HOME, THAT SOME OF THE FLOOR WAS WET AGAIN.  (500 MILE DRIVE ONE WAY FROM HOME TO THE DEALER) NOW THE FURNACE DOES NOT WORK RIGHT AND ANYTHING THAT IS STEEL IN THE CAMPER STARTED TO CORRODE.  ALSO SOME OF THE CABINET DOORS ARE STARTING TO SEPARATE( I THINK FROM ALL THE MOISTURE).  I ALSO DON'T THINK THE ELECTRIC  BRAKES EVER WORKED.  NOW I ASKED THEM TO BUY THE CAMPER BACK AND THEY STATED THEY WOULD SELL IT ON CONSIGNMENT FOR ME.  BUT THAT MEANS I WOULD LOOSE SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS BECAUSE THEIR CAMPER IS JUNK. NOW MY QUESTION TO YOU IS,  IS THIS RIGHT? OR DO I HAVE A CASE AGAINST SCAMP?  (SCAMP 19FT WHEEL CAR 02).   *SCC   *NLM    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*770806",
