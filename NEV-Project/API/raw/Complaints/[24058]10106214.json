I KNOW THERE ARE LOT OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH THIS VEHICLE AND WANT TO KNOW IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO HAVE DAIMLER/CHRYSLER FIX THIS PROBLEM. I ALSO, KNOW THAT THERE IS A RECALL FOR 2000-2004 MODELS, BUT WHAT ABOUT 1999 MODELS. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH SIMILAR PROBLEMS EXIST WITH PREMATURE AGING OF THE BALL JOINTS AND OTHER FRONT END COMPONENTS. *AK",
