FOR MOST OF THAT TIME THE ADD COOLANT LIGHT HAS COME ON INTERMITTENTLY.  MY PONTIAC DEALER TELLS ME THAT I NEED A $900 REPAIR TO REPLACE A INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET.  IN CONVERSING WITH OTHER GM OWNERS, I HAVE LEARNED THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE COOLING SYSTEM POSSIBLY DUE TO THE DEX-COOL ANTIFREEZE WHICH GM SAYS SHOULD LAST 150,000 MILES.  I FEEL THAT GM SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE FAILURES.      E G ARMENTROUT.  *JB",
