ON THE FIRST TWO OCCASSIONS THERE WAS NO \"WARNING INDICATOR\" OR \"CHECK ENGINE LIGHT.\"  THEY SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THERE IS SOME SORT OF WARNING BEFORE THIS PROBLEMS HAPPENS, BUT IN MY CASE THERE WAS NOT.  THE FIRST TWO TIMES THIS HAPPENED TO ME THE CAR JUST DIED WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND WOULD NOT RESTART.  THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING OR LIGHT TO TELL ME SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH MY CAR.  THE THIRD TIME IT HAPPENED I DID HAVE THE LIGHT FLASH AND THE CAR RIDE ROUGH.  THIS CAR IS ABSOLUTLY DEADLY.  I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH THE FIRST TWO TIMES TO BE ABLE TO PULL OFF THE ROAD.  DO NOT LET AUDI AND VW FOOL YOU INTO THINKING THAT THERE IS ALWAYS A WARNING BEFORE THIS HAPPENS.  THE CAR IS DEADLY AND SOMETIMES THERE IS NO WARNING WHEN IT IS GOING TO DIE.  FOR INCIDENT DATE I PUT THE FIRST INCIDENT ONLY.",
