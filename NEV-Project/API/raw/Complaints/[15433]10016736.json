        "summary": "THE TRANSMISSION (6SPD OF THE SPEC V MODEL) IS DEFECTIVE. 3RD GEAR SYNCHROS GO BAD, SHIFTING FEEL CLUNKY/KNOTCHY TO WHERE ITS HARD TO GET IN GEAR ESPECIALLY WHEN ITS COLD. TOOK IT IN THE FIRST TIME ON 3/26/02 AND THEY DECIDED TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION. DEALER PULLED TRANSMISSION 1. WITHOUT DISCUSSING IT WITH ME AND 2. WITHOUT HAVING THE PART IN STOCK. TOOK 2 WEEKS TO GET THE NEW TRANSMISSION IN WHICH IF WE HADNT FOUGHT WITH THEM THEY WERENT PLANNING ON GIVING US A RENTAL. NOW IM TAKING IT IN AGAIN FOR THE SAME PROBLEM. GRINDING AS IT GOES INTO 3RD. THIS TIME THEY SAY THEY ARE REPLACING IT WITH A 2003 TRANSMISSION AND IT SHOULD FIX THE PROBLEM. SO APPARENTLY NISSAN IS AWARE OF THE DEFECT. SINCE ITS ON 2 OCCASION I WILL PUT THE LATER DATE. THE FIRST TIME IT WAS TAKEN IN 3/26/02 AND REPLACED 4/11/02 AND NOW IM TAKING IT BACK IN ON 4/30/03 TO BE FIXED AGAIN",
