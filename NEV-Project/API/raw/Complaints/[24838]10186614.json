I HAVE SINCE PERSONALLY OBSERVED 4 KIA SORENTOS IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA ON THE ROAD WITH THE LEFT, RIGHT OR BOTH REAR TAIL LIGHTS NOT FUNCTIONING.  I HAVE ALSO OBSERVED 3 KIA SORENTOS IN THE SF BAY AREA WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  OTHER KIA PRODUCTS MAY ALSO HAVE THIS ISSUE BUT IT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM/CONCERN WITH THE SORENTO.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND MAY RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT OR INJURY.  YOUR ACTION TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER IS NEEDED FOR A LONG TERM SOLUTION AND/OR RECALL. *JB",
