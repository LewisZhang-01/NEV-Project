WHILE DRIVING ALONG A FOGGY INTERSTATE 79, I WITNESSED SEVERAL CARS WITHOUT TAIL LIGHTS, ONLY TO FIND THEY HAD HEADLIGHTS ON.  THIS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCIDENT IN MARYLAND.  PERHAPS THESE DRIVERS WERE UN-AWARE OF THIS SAFETY SHORTFALL ON THEIR VEHICLES.  I WITNESSED THIS ON SEVERAL GMC VEHICLES AS WELL AS TOYOTAS.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.      *TT",
