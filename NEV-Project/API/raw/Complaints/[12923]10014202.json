UNDER THE RECALL CAMPAIGN#01I002000, THE TIMING BELT AND TENSIONER FAILED WHILE I WAS DRIVING AND THE CAR WOULD NOT START, ALSO THE VALVES AND PISTONS WERE DAMAGED.  MY VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED BUT HERE IT IS, ABOUT SIX MONTHS LATER AND 15,000 MILES MY VEHICLE HAS THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM HAPPENING AGAIN AND ISUZU REFUSES TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  MARK SMITH (SERVICE REP.) FOR ISUZU ADVISED ME THAT THE PARTS THEY REPLACED WERE ONLY WARRANT FOR 12,000 MILES, BUT I FEEL LIKE IF THE SAME PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED THEN MY VEHICLE SHOULD BE REPAIRED.  *JB",
