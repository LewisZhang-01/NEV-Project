WHEN I SPOKE WITH THE DEALER THEY SAID IT WAS NOT PART OF A RECALL. BUT THEY WOULD SPLIT THE COST WITH ME -MY END WOULD BE $650. I COULD NOT AFFORD IT AND IT HAS CONTINUED TO RUMPLE AND BUBBLE UP. I AM THE ONLY OWNER. IT IS A DEFECT THAT NO ONE WANTS TO ADDRESS. ESPECIALLY, SINCE MY WARRANTY WILL BE UP WITH IN A MONTH OR TWO. I JUST GOT TIRED OF FIGHTING WITH THE DEALER TO DO SOMETHING. I HAVE GIVEN UP AND WILL NOT BE PURCHASING A GM CAR AGAIN. THANKS FOR NOTHING -MY LOYALTY IS GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE.  *JB",
