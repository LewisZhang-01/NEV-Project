EACH TIME, THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE DEALER AND SUPPOSEDLY FIXED, BUT WITHOUT FAIL, THE LIGHT CAME BACK ON EACH TIME.  THE SEATBELT BUCKLE WAS CHANGED, CONNECTIONS WERE SECURED, THEY SAID IT WAS SHORTED (GUIDED FAULT FINDINGS, BUMPER COVER REMOVED, SEAT REMOVED), AND OTHERS.  I HAVE ALL COPIES OF SERVICE RECORDS.  AFTER ALL THESE SERVICE VISITS, THE AIRBAG LIGHT IS STILL ON AND WE ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT THE AIRBAG SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY AND COULD CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE AND MAY NOT DEPLOY CORRECTLY DURING AN ACCIDENT.    I HEARD THERE WAS AN INVESTIGATION BEING CONDUCT ON THE 2004 NEW BEETLES AND WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW OF OUR EXPERIENCE.  *TR  CRASH SENSOR.PCO",
