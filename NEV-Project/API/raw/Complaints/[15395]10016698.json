I SENT THEM A LETTER AND THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO BECAUSE MY WARRANTY WAS UP, BUT WHO PUTS A 36,000 MILE WARRANTY ON A VEHICLE UNLESS THEY KNOW THE ENGINE IS JUNK.  THEY NEED TO FESS UP TO THEIR DEFECT OF THIS TYPE OF ENGINE AND RECALL IT.  IT IS NOT RIGHT.  I AM A 23 YEAR OLD SINGLE MOTHER WHO STILL OWES 10,000 DOLLARS ON A CAR THAT I CAN'T EVEN DRIVE BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE 6,000 DOLLARS TO GIVE THEM FOR A NEW ENGINE.  *JB",
