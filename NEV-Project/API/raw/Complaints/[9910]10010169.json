ON 3/6/2003, AS CAR WAS TRAVELING AT APPROXIMATELY 50 MPH ON A BUSY HIGHWAY (PALMETTO EXPRESSWAY) DURING RUSH HOUR, THE CAR TURNED OFF, STEERING LOCKED. THANKFULLY I WAS ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE WAY OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. IT WAS A MIRACLE I DIDN'T GET HIT BY OTHERS TRAVELING AT EVEN FASTER SPEEDS. I TOOK THE CAR, SAME EVENING TO BRAMAN HONDA, THE CLOSEST DEALERSHIP, WHERE THE FOLLOWING DAY IT WAS REPAIRED. SUPPOSEDLY, THE COMPUTER HAD NOT BEEN PROGRAMMED AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND IRRESPONSIBLE. I COULD HAVE DIED, CAUSED SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO MYSELF, THE CAR AND MANY OTHERS ON THE SAME ROAD THAT DAY.   *NLM",
