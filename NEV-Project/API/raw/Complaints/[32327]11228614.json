IT SUDDENLY DROPPED MY SPEED FROM 70 MPH TO 30.  I WAS PRESENTED WITH SEVERAL ALERTS ON MY DASH (EMISSIONS FAILURE, SH-AWD FAILURE, TRANSMISSION FAILURE).  I WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE DRIVING AT 30 MPH UNTIL I COULD GET TO A SAFE AREA.  AFTER I TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE AND WAITED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME THE WARNINGS WOULD CLEAR.  I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE TO A DEALERSHIP WHILE THE WARNINGS WERE PRESENT.  I WAS TOLD AFTER DIAGNOSIS THAT THE TRANSMISSION SOFTWARE NEEDED TO BE UPDATED.  AFTER THE UPDATE THE PROBLEM HAS NOT PRESENTED ITSELF AGAIN.  I WAS TOLD SOFTWARE UPDATES ARE NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY UNLESS THEY ARE A RECALL ISSUE.",
