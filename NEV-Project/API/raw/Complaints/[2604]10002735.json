MY TIRES HAD JUST BEEN ROTATED AND BALANCED, AND THE AIR PRESSURE ADJUSTED ON SATURDAY, JANUARY 11, 2003.  AT THAT TIME, NO PROBLEMS WERE REPORTED.  I HAD 33,000 MILES ON THE CAR/TIRES AND HAD THE TIRES ROTATED EVERY 7500 MILES.    MY TIRES WERE FIRESTONE FR680, P185/65R14 85S.    THIS HAPPENED WITHOUT WARNING, CAUSING THE CAR TO BEGIN A SUDDEN SPIN ACROSS THE INTERSTATE.  NO ONE WAS INJURED, UNBELIEVABLY.    I RETURNED TO THE PLACE WHERE I HAD MY TIRES ROTATED AND BALANCED JUST TWO DAYS BEFORE.  THEY WERE VERY HELPFUL AND REPLACED THE TIRE AT NO COST.  THEY ALSO INSPECTED THE VALVE OF THE TIRE THAT HAD A BLOWOUT AND FOUND IT TO HAVE A LEAK.",
