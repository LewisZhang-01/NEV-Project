SOUNDS LIKE GEARS AREN'T MESHING PROPERLY. I HAVE TO TURN OFF THE TRACTION CONTROL EVERY TIME I GO OVER A SPEED BUMP TO CORRECT THE ISSUE. RPMS GET SUPER HIGH BEFORE THE JEEP DECIDES TO CHANGE GEARS AND KICK UP. THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE CAR LURCHES FORWARD WHEN I BRAKE COMING TO A STOP. NOT ALWAYS BUT ENOUGH TO MAKE ME WEARY IN PARKING LOTS. MOSTLY DRIVE IN THE CITY.",
