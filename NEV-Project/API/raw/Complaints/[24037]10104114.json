THE MECHANIC ALSO TOLD MY HUSBAND THAT THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  HE SAID THAT IT WAS A NISSAN FAULT ON THE CAR.  I DON'T FEEL THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING TO GET IT FIXED SINCE THE DIPSTICK IS MADE OF PLASTIC AND IS SO CLOSE TO OTHER HEATED ENGINE PARTS.  BEING SO CLOSE TO THOSE OTHER PARTS SURELY MADE THE PIECE MELT AND LATER BREAK OFF.  *AK",
