AREAS OF FAILURE INCLUDE UP TO AND AROUND THE PORTION WHICH SAYS \"AIR BAG\" WHICH IS CREATING A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONCERN.  PLASTIC FRAGMENTS ARE LOOSE ON CRACKED AREAS OF DASH.  THIS PRESENTS A POSSIBLE HIGH-SPEED PROJECTILE HAZARD IF AIR BAG(S) ARE DEPLOYED AND CATCH ON LOOSE/CRACKED AREAS DURING DEPLOYMENT.  VEHICLE HAS NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY INCIDENTS.  DASHBOARD SURROUNDING AIRBAG CRACKED WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY AND CONTINUES TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL CRACKS AS TIME GOES ON.  FINALLY, DASHBOARD IS VIBRATING WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS CAUSING ADDITIONAL CRACKS AND FRAGMENTS OF PLASTIC TO COME LOOSE.  DISCUSSIONS WITH MECHANICS INDICATE THAT ENTIRE DASH MAY COME LOOSE AND FALL IN TO DRIVERS OR PASSENGER UNDER NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS, CAUSING LOSS OF CONTROL IN ADDITION TO POSSIBLE AIR-BAG PROJECTILE HAZARD.  TWO LOCAL GMC DEALERS INDICATED THAT THIS IS NOT A COVERED REPAIR AND THAT THE CONSUMER SHOULD REPLACE THE DASH ON THEIR OWN IF THERE IS A SAFETY CONCERN BY THE CONSUMER.",
