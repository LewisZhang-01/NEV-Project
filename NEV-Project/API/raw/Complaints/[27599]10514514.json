I CALLED THE DEALER AND, OF COURSE, IT'S NOT UNDER WARRANTY AND NOR IS THERE A RECALL ON THIS PART. I'VE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH AND NOTICED MANY, MANY PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE. MULTIPLE PEOPLE HAVE ALSO CONTACTED NISSAN AND HAVE AWFUL RESULTS FROM THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE. I, ALONG WITH OTHERS, DEMAND THAT A RECALL BE PERFORMED ON THE REAR SWAY BAR FOR 2007 NISSANS. IT'S DEPLORABLE A BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY CAN'T OWN UP TO A MANUFACTURING ISSUE THAT MANY ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT. IT ALSO DOESN'T HELP THAT NISSAN CUSTOMER SERVICE IS ONE OF THE WORST RATED!  *TR",
