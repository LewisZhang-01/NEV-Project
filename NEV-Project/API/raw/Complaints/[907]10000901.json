BECAUSE WE COULD ONLY FIND TEH LAST THREE OIL CHANGE RECEIPTS, THE DEALER SAYS THEY ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE THE REPAIR.    AT FIRST, THEY SID IT WAS AN OIL PUMP.  I CALLED CHRYSLER AND THEY WERE WILLING TO REPLACE THE PUMP ALTHOUGH I AM 19K MILES OUT OF WARRANTY.  THIS TELLS ME THEY KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM.    NOW, AFTER SEARCHING THE INTERET AND CALLING AN ATTRONEY, I FIND 182 LIKE COMPLAINTS FOR THE 2000 MODEL YEAR DURANGO AND DAKOTA.  NO ONE AT TEH CORPORATE OR DEALER LEVEL WILL WORK WITH ME UNLESS I PAY $6,000 FOR THE REPAIR.  CAN ANYONE SAY CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT?",
