I CONTACT THE MITSUBISHI DEALER (866-346-0796) ON SEPT. 10, 2013 WHERE I MY PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND EXPLAINED TO THEM IN DETAIL THE PROBLEM WITH THE PASSENGER AIR BAG. THE SERVICE WRITER ASKED FOR THE LAST EIGHT DIGIT OF THE VEHICLE VIN # WHICH I PROVIDED. THE SERVICE WRITER PULLED UP THE HISTORY IN HIS COMPUTER AND ADVISED ME THAT THE CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT. I WAS VERY SURPRISED BY HIS ANSWER AND TOLD HIM I WILL CONTACT MITSUBISHI CORP. OFFICE TO FIND A RESOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM BEFORE IT GET WORST.     AND FOR THE RECORD I'VE PREVIOUSLY OWNED TWO MONTERO MITSUBISHI SUV.   *TR",
