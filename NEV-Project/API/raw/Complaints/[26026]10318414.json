        "summary": "I, MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY  AND BUSINESS ASSOCIATES HAVE EXPERIENCED A STICKING ACCELERATOR ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS ON MY 2009 TOYOTA LANDCRUISER.  THIS WAS NOT DUE TO THE FLOOR MATS.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE TOYOTA DEALER, JOE MACHENS, IN COLUMBIA MISSOURI COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  THEY STATED NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.  I REQUESTED THEY ESCALATE THE PROBLEM TO THEIR REGIONAL DIVISION WHO STATED THAT I WAS THE ONLY ONE MAKING THIS COMPLAINT.  CLEARLY, I WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM.  I CALLED TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ISSUED THE SAME COMPLAINT AND WHILE THEY DOCUMENTED MY CALL, DID NOT OFFER ANY SOLUTIONS.  THERE ARE SERVICE DOCUMENTS OF MY ISSUE WITH THE TOYOTA DEALER.  THIS PROBLEM OCCURS AT RANDOM TIMES, WITHOUT WARNING, AT ALL DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SPEED.  IT IS QUITE FRANKLY, SCARY.  I HAVE TRIED TO LIFT UP THE ACCELERATOR TO SEE IF IT WAS \"STUCK\".  THE ACCELERATOR WOULD MOVE BUT IT WON'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON THE SPEED OF THE VEHICLE.  I FIRMLY BELIEVE THE PROBLEM IS ELECTRONIC.  PLEASE UNDERSTAND I AM A BIG FAN OF THE LANDCRUISER LINE FROM TOYOTA.  I HAVE A 92 LNADCRUISER WHICH HAS 250,000 MILES ON IT.  HOWEVER, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE ADD THE 09 LANDCRUISER TO THE RECALL LIST BEFORE IT HURTS OR INJURIES ME OR SOMEONE ELSE. *TR",
