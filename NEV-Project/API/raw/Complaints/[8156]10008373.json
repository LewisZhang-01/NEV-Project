THE LENSES HAVE YELLOWED AND ARE PITTED CAUSING A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF LIGHT OUTPUT.  IT IS LESS SAFE TO DRIVE THIS CAR AT NIGHT.  I WROTE TO DAIMLER CHRYSLER AND THEY DENIED MY CLAIM.  THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE REPAIR IS EXPENSIVE BUT STATED THAT THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS A WARRANTY ISSUE - I BELIEVE IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE.",
