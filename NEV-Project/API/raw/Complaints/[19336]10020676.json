THERE WAS A HARD RAIN AND WE WERE DRIVING ALONG THE INTERSTATE WITH MANY OTHER PERSONAL AND COMMERCIAL VEHICLES WHEN WE ENCOUNTERED THE PROBLEM.  WE WERE FORCED TO PULL OFF THE ROAD AND MANUALLY DISENGAGE THE WIPER BLADES FROM ONE ANOTHER.  WE THEN PROCEEDED TOWARD OUR DESTINATION WHEN THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED AGAIN.  UPON OUR RETURN HOME OUR VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER AND THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED.  THE SERVICE PERSONNEL SEEMED VERY DISINTERESTED AND SIMPLY REPLACED THE BLADES WITH CHEAP REFILLS. WE WERE TOLD THAT NEW WIPER BLADES WERE BEING ORDERED BUT WE HAVE YET TO HEAR FROM ANYONE (ONE MONTH LATER).  WE HAVE CONTACTED THE DEALER ON SEVERAL OCCATIONS BUT WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A RESPONSE.  THEIR SERVICE AFTER THE SELL IS EXTREMELY LOUSY TO SAY THE LEAST!    STILL WAITING",
