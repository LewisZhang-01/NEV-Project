        "summary": "AFTER A VERY FRUSTRATING AND DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE WITH A GMC SUV WE BOUGHT A 2003 TOYOTA SR5 4RUNNER.  UP TO THIS POINT WE HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH IT.  HOWEVER, AN AMMONIA/SULFUR ODOR HAS BEEN NOTED INSIDE THE CABIN WHEN DRIVING AND CAUSES EXTREME IRRITATION AND A BURNING FEELING IN THE THROAT AND LUNGS OF ANYONE IN THE VEHICLE. THEY ALL IMMEDIATELY COMPLAIN.  WE HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS.  WE CHECKED THIS SITE TO SEE IF OTHERS HAVE HAD THE SAME COMPLAINT....THEY HAVE.  WE TALKED WITH OUR DEALER ABOUT IT AND WERE TOLD IT WAS THE NATURE OF THE FUMES GIVEN OFF FROM THE FUEL.  WE BELIEVE A WIND DEFLECTOR/REAR SPOILER MAY HELP THIS PROBLEM BUT ALSO LEARNED FROM OUR DEALER THAT ONE IS NOT MADE (YET) FOR THIS MODEL 4RUNNER.  THIS PHYSICAL IRRITATION AND BURNING FELT WHILE DRIVING IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND WE HOPE MORE COMPLAINTS FILED WILL CAUSE ENOUGH CONCERN TO GET SOMETHING DONE.  EITHER WITH THE FUEL OR A PRODUCT TO ELIMINATE THESE ODORS FROM ENTERING THE CABIN.  *NLM",
