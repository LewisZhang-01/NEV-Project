THE AIRBAG SEEMED TO PERFORM AS INTENDED, HOWEVER, TO THIS DATE I HAVE HORRIFYING PLASTIC MATERIAL COMING FROM THE INSIDE... AND OUTSIDE OF MY CHEEKS. IT HAS CAUSED VERY VISIBLE PATTERNS TO PROTRUDE FROM THE SKIN, CONSTANT PAIN, AND DESPERATE EFFORTS TO GET ANSWERS. THOUGH I HAVE BEEN TO MANY DOCTORS, I HAVE FAILED TO ESCAPE THE RESEARCH EVASIVE REALITIES OF MY PROVIDERS. LABS SIMPLY FAIL TO IDENTIFY, AND DOCTORS AGREE THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM... THEN SEND ME TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO SAYS THE SAME.  I HAVE STRUGGLED WITH KEEPING MY HOPE ALIVE.  I AM NOW PAYING LABS I FOUND TO CONDUCT STUDIES OF THE SAMPLES. I HAVE ALSO FOUND SOME VERY CONCERNING MEDICAL ARTICLES THAT MIRROR MY SYMPTOMS POST AUTO ACCIDENT. HOWEVER, THESE ARE FROM NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING DOCTORS IN GERMANY, AND JAPAN. I WROTE TOYOTA VIA-EMAIL SOME TIME AGO... NEEDLESS TO SAY I HAVE SEEN NO INTEREST ON THEIR SIDE. I FEAR THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM, AND SOMEONE NEEDS TO LOOK INTO IT VERY SERIOUSLY! PLEASE HELP ME.  *JB",
