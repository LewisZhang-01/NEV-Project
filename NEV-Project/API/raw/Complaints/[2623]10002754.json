THE FORD DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS A RESULT OF A BROKEN SENSOR WELD ON MY INTAKE MANIFOLD TO THE TUNE OF APPROX. $900. THEY ALSO STATED THAT THE O/D OFF LIGHT MEANT THAT THE ENTIRE TRANSMISSION NEEDED REPLACED TO THE TUNE OF $2,700. ALL THIS FOR BEING 1 MONTH AND 500 MILES OUT OF WARRANTY. PLUS, I SEE THAT MANY PEOPLE WITH FORD WINDSTARS ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME THING AT 35,000 MILES AND 70,000 (TWICE) SO I SEE THAT I WILL UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO WHEN THE WARRANTY RUNS OUT ON THE TRANSMISSION... ALMOST LIKE THE DARNED THING IS DELIBERATELY DESIGNED TO CREATE A HUGE REPAIR BILL THE MOMENT IT IS OUT OF WARRANTY.",
