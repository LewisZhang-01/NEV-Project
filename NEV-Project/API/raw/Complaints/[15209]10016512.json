I WAS INFORMED, WITH 57,600 MILES AND LESS THAN FOUR YEARS ON IT, MY VAN NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION.  WARRANTY WAS RECENTLY EXPIRED.  CALLED AMERICAN HONDA TO SEE IF THEY WOULD COVER ANY REPAIRS.  OPERATOR ASKED WHAT I EXPECTED OF THEM.  I ASKED THEM TO COVER THE COST OF PARTS (ABOUT $4600).  SHE SAID SHE'D SUBMIT THE REQUEST.  SHE DIDN'T MENTION THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO A LARGE NUMBER OF 1999 ODYSSEYS (APPARENTLY ALSO 2000'S, 2001'S AND 2002'S.)  SUSPECT (FROM A WEB SEARCH) THAT THIS WILL BE A RECURRING PROBLEM.             *JB",
