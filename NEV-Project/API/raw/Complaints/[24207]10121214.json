I CONTACTED FORD AND THEY ARE UNWILLING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  MY VEHICLE IS THE SAME YEAR AS THE YEAR LISTED IN THE RECALL.  IT SEEMS VERY ODD THAT I AM HAVING THIS ISSUE YET I SOME HOW MISSED THE RECALL WINDOW BY A SMALL MARGIN.  THIS IS A SAFETY RELATED ISSUE AND I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT FORD HAS NOT RESPONDED APPROPRIATELY. *JS    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6)",
