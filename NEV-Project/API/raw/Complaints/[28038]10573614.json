THE DEALER FOUND THE LEAK FROM THE BRAKE VACUUM PUMP BEFORE DID THE RECALL REPAIR, BUT ONLY REPLACED THE BRAKE BOOSTER VACUUM HOSE AND LEAVE THE BRAKE VACUUM PUMP LEAK UNREPAIRED AND QUOTED ME $2800 FOR REPAIRING THE BRAKE VACUUM PUMP LEAK. I CALLED BMW USA CUSTOMER RELATIONS AND WAS TOLD THAT I SHOULD CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE DEALER AND SAID IT'S THE DEALER DECISION. THIS SEEMS NOT RIGHT FOR ME SINCE THE ROOT CAUSE WAS NOT FIXED FOR THE RECALL.    PLEASE ADVICE WHAT I SHOULD DO.
