I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON 2002 FORD TAURUS, BUT AT A DIFFERENT TRIM LEVEL.  I CALLED THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD THERE WERE NO OPEN RECALLS FOR MY VIN AND THAT NO REPAIR RELATED TO THE BRAKE LAMP SWITCH WAS EVER DONE BY A FORD DEALERSHIP.  I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND IF MY 2002 TAURUS SE WAS MANUFACTURED DIFFERENTLY THAN THE RECALLED VEHICLES.  I AM HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL (04S12) BUT MY MODEL WAS NOT INCLUDED.  WAS IT DETERMINED THAT IT WAS A DEFECTIVE PART THAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM OR DEFECTIVE LABOR? *TR",
