IT HAS BEEN A YEAR AND I CONTACTED THEM REGARDING THIS ISSUE AND THEY STILL HAVE NO FIX AND NO ETA FOR A FIX. THEY TOLD ME TO CONTACT TAKATA. THEY ADMIT IN THEIR LETTER THAT IS A SERIOUS AND POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING PROBLEM AND WILL MAKE IT THEIR \"HIGHEST PRIORITY\". APPARENTLY, THAT MEANS THEY NEED SOMEONE TO DIE FIRST. MAYBE SOMEONE HAS...I DON'T KNOW BUT WILL SURELY LOOK INTO IT. THEY CLEARLY HAVE NO SENSE OF URGENCY REGARDING THIS ISSUE OR FOR THE SAFETY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS.",
