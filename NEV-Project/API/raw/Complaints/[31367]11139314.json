I HAVE ATTACHED TWO PICTURES THAT I TOOK. ONE IS MY NISSAN ALTIMA SHOWING NORMAL PROJECTION AND THE CADILLAC SRX WHICH CLEARLY SHOWS IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AT NIGHT. THE DEALER AND CADILLAC REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THERE IS AN ISSUE AND WILL DO NOTHING. RESEARCH CLEARLY SHOWS THIS TO BE AN ISSUE IN 2010 TO 2015 CADILLACS. CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN FILES IN MULTIPLE STATES. I CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE LET MY WIFE DRIVE IT AT NIGHT AND SHE STATES SHE IS AFRAID TO DO SO. I BELIEVE THE FOLKS AT NHSTA SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL BEFORE PEOPLE ARE HURT IN ACCIDENT. THANK YOU.",
