        "summary": "COMPLAINTS INVOLVING IDLER PULLEY AND BRAKE SYSTEM.     ON JUNE 4, 2017, WHILE DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE, MY STEERING WHEEL LOCKED UP. I WAS ABLE TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND THEN THE CAR STARTED MALFUNCTIONING.  IT COMPLETELY DIED AND WOULD NOT START.  I FOUND OUT FROM THE DEALERSHIP ON JUNE 5, 2017 THAT THE ISSUE WAS RELATED TO THE IDLER PULLEY CRUMBLING WHICH IN-TURN CAUSED THE SERPENTINE BELT TO BREAK.    ON JULY 9, 2017, I WAS AT A STOP LIGHT ON THE I-10 FRONTAGE ROAD.  WHEN THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN, I COULD NOT GO BECAUSE THE BRAKES LOCKED UP.  I HAD TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK, TURN IT OFF AND THEN TURN IT BACK ON IN ORDER FOR THE BRAKES TO LOOSEN UP.      TO SAY I'M FRUSTRATED WITH DODGE IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT.  DURING BOTH INSTANCES, MY 8-YR OLD DAUGHTER WAS IN THE CAR WITH ME.  I'VE ONLY HAD THIS CAR FOR THREE YEARS, IT ISN'T PAID OFF AND I'M HAVING THESE PROBLEMS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE LIFE THREATENING.  A RECALL NEEDS TO HAPPEN WITH THIS VEHICLE!!!",
