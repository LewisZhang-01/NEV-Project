        "summary": "FIRST INCIDENT I WAS DRIVING DOWN A MOUNTAIN (MALIBU CANYON ROAD) AROUND 10:30PM AND THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION WENT OUT OF GEAR BY ITSELF AND I HAD NO FORWARD CONTROL. THE ENGINE REVVED BUT THE TRANSMISSION WAS NOT ENGAGED. I WAS GOING DOWNHILL BUT IT TOOK ME AWHILE TO FIND A PLACE TO PULL OFF THE ROAD. THERE WAS NO CELLPHONE SERVICE IN THAT LOCATION SO I WAITED FOR A FEW MINUTES TO FLAG SOMEONE DOWN. NO ONE CAME BY SO I RESTARTED MY CAR AND WAS ABLE TO GET IT BACK INTO GEAR.    THE SECOND INCIDENT MY WIFE AND I WERE DRIVING ON THE 101 FREEWAY AT APPROXIMATELY 65MPH AND THE TRANSMISSION DISENGAGED FROM DRIVE AND WENT INTO NEUTRAL WITHOUT ANY WARNING.  WE NEARLY GOT REAR ENDED AND BY LUCK WERE ABLE TO COAST TO AN OFF RAMP. UPON REACHING THE BOTTOM OF THE OFF RAMP, I TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND WAITED A MINUTE AND UPON RESTARTING THE ENGINE I WAS ABLE TO REENGAGE IT IN DRIVE.    THE THIRD TIME BEFORE I DECIDED TO BRING IT TO THE MERCEDES DEALER, I WAS DRIVING IN TRAFFIC ON THOUSAND OAKS BLVD. AND EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM. I HAD TO PULL OVER INTO THE RIGHT LANE, CURB THE CAR AND SHUT OFF THE MOTOR. AFTER A FEW MINUTES I RESTARTED THE CAR AND WAS ABLE TO BUT IT BACK INTO GEAR.     ALL OF THESE INCIDENTS TOOK PLACE WITHIN A 1 1/2 MONTH PERIOD AND I CANNOT TRUST THE CAR TO BE SAFE ANY LONGER WITH THIS CONDITION.  *TR",
