TOOK TO LOCAL DEALER AND FOUND THAT MAINFOLD GASKET WAS LEAKING AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND THE REAR CYLINDERS WERE LEAKING AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. REPAIR COST $1078.00 FOR BOTH. THIS VAN ONLY HAS 56,000 MILES. GOOD TO SEE THAT OTHERS ARE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THESE COMPONENTS, MAYBE THE MANUFACTURER NEEDS TO RECALL AND FIX THESE PROBLEMS.  A VEHICLE OWNER SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SPEND THIS KIND OF MONEY(FOR THESE KIND OF REPAIRS) AND RISK THEIR FAMILY ON THE ROADSIDE ON VEHICLES WITH THIS FEW OF MILES AND AGE. I'VE ALSO HAD AN AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT ON FOR MOST OF THE TIME THAT I'VE HAD THE VEHICLE.  IT WAS WORKED ON A COUPLE OF TIMES DURING THE WARRANTY PERIOD.  THE DEALER SAID IT WAS AN AIR BAG SENSOR PROBLEM.  THIS VEHICLE HAS FRONT AND SIDE AIR BAGS.  I HOPE THE AIR BAGS DEPLOY IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT.",
