        "summary": "MY TRUCK FAILED TO START, AND WHEN I INVESTIGATED THE ISSUE I FOUND FUSE 27 (LOCATED IN THE BATTERY JUNCTION BOX AT THE FRONT OF THE ENGINE BAY) MELTED CAUSING CIRCUIT FOR THE FUEL PUMP TO OPEN WHICH LEFT THE TRUCK WITHOUT A FUNCTIONING FUEL SYSTEM (FUSE 27 IS PART OF THE CIRCUIT FOR THE FUEL PUMP). REPLACING THE DAMAGED FUSE RESOLVED THE ISSUE WHILE A MORE ROBUST SOLUTION IS DETERMINED.    IF THIS HAD HAPPENED DURING OPERATION THE VEHICLE WOULD HAVE LOST POWER, BEEN UNABLE TO STEER DUE TO AN ELECTRIC ASSISTED STEERING SYSTEM AND BECOME A HAZARD FOR OTHER VEHICLES WHILE PUTTING THE OCCUPANTS OF THE TRUCK, AND ANY VEHICLE THAT COLLIDES WITH IT, AT RISK FOR INJURY OR DEATH. FORD ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (TSB 15-0137), BUT THIS IS NOT COMMONLY KNOWN OUTSIDE OF VEHICLE-SPECIFIC SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS ON THE INTERNET (HTTPS://WWW.FORD-TRUCKS.COM/FORUMS/1449733-TSB-15-0137-FUEL-PUMP-FUSE.HTML).     FORD KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE AND THE CONSEQUENCES ARE OBVIOUS. THE FIX FORD RECOMMENDS IS INEXPENSIVE (UNDER $30 IN PARTS) AND NOT VERY TIME CONSUMING (0.6 FLAG HOURS).",
