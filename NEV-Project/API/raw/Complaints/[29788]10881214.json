THE CRACKS  ARE INITIATED THROUGH THE SMALLES STONES THROWN FROM VEHICLES AHEAD. ALL INCIDENCES HAPPENED WHILE IN MOTION AND AT LEAST 3 IN INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS. SO FAR WE REPLACED IT WITH 2 OEM WINDSHIELDS AND THE OTHERS WERE AFTERMARKET. THERE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IN TERMS OF CHIP OR CRACK RESISTANCE. I STRUGGLE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS COULD BE PURE COINCIDENCE. HAVING TO REPLACE A WINDSHIELD AN AVERAGE OF EVERY 6 MONTHS IS NOT REGULAR MAINTENANCE.",
