I HAVE HAD IT REPAIRED THREE TIMES AND TRIED TO REPAIR IT MYSELF THREE TIMES. I HAVE SPENT OVER FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE FIRST YEAR OF OWNERSHIP AND NOW IT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A MUCH MORE WIDE SPREAD PROBLEM THAN IS BEING REPORTED. VOLKSWAGEN SHOULD BE MADE TO REPAIR THE BUMPERS AT NO CHARGE OR RECALL ALL EFFECTED VEHICLES AND STRENGTHEN THE BUMPER ASSEMBLY.   *TS   *NLM      **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12-12-02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**770127",
