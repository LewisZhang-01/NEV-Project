THE PLASTIC CLIPS USED BY THESE SCREWS HAVE BROKEN OFF FRON THE DOOR PANEL.  EVERYTIME I CLOSE THE DOOR, PANEL PULLS AWAY FROM DOOR.  OTHER THAN PANELS CLIPS THIS IS THE ONLY WAY IT SECURES TO THE DOOR.  PANEL CLIPS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO UNDERGO THE STRESS OF CLOSING THE DOOR.  HAVING THE CLIPS OUT OF PLASTIC WITH NO METAL REINFORCEMENT THEY BREAK CAUSING THE PANEL TO COME LOOSE.  MATERIALS NEED A METAL REINFORCEMENT TO WITH STAND THE EVERY DAY STRESS OF CLOSING DOORS.  BOTH DRIVER AND PASSENGER HAVE IDENTICAL FLAWS.  MIDDLE CONSOLE HAS SAME MOUNTING CLIPS AND HAS ALSO BROKEN IN INDENTICAL FASHION.  PLASTIC IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR SUCH AREAS OF HIGH STRESS.",
