THE TANK LATCH NO LONGER OPERATES AS INTENDED AND MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LIFT THE TANK WITHOUT REMOVING THE LATCH ITSELF. THE TANK IS ALSO APPLYING PRESSURE ON THE SEAT CAUSING PAINT TO CHIP OFF.      PLEASE NOTE, THE MODEL IS NOT A 620CC MOTORCYCLE, IT IS A 992CC MOTORCYCLE. SPECIFICALLY THE S2R1000. HOWEVER THERE ARE VERY FEW DIFFERENCES IN THE MODEL, EXCEPT THE BRAKE SIZE, AND THE ENGINE SIZE. *TR",
