I HAVE TOLD MY DEALERSHIP, ED VOYLES HONDA (MIKI MULLINAX IS MY SERVICE ADVISOR) ABOUT THIS SINCE I FIRST PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND I WAS TOLD THAT THIS IS \"JUST NORMAL\".  I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW A CONDITION THAT IS POTENTIALLY SO DANGEROUS CAN BE \"JUST NORMAL\".    ALSO, MY SRS INDICATOR HAS COME ON FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON AND I EXPLAINED THIS TO MY DEALERSHIP, AFTER LOOKING AT THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN ON THIS WEBSITE, AND THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE ME PAY A DIAGNOSTIC FEE TO SEE IF THIS WAS TRUE OR NOT.  I ACTUALLY ALSO HAD AN INSTANCE OF THE FAILED MIL WHICH WAS RESOLVED BY MY DEALER YESTERDAY (HONDA SERVICE BULLETIN #00-017).    PLEASE ADVISE ON THESE ISSUES.    THANKS.    JODY KELL    PS: THE INCIDENT DATE THAT I AM USING IS THE DAY THAT I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE, WHICH IS WHEN THE SEAT ISSUE FIRST BEGAN.",
