IN OTHER WORDS I HAVE A CAR THAT I NOW CANNOT USE FOR AT LEAST A YEAR.  I SPOKE WITH A JOHN WHO SAID TO CONTACT A GM DEALER TO HAVE THE FRONT PASSENGER AIRBAG DISCONNECTED....THE GM DEALER REFUSES TO DO IT...ITS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THEY EXPECT PEOPLE TO WAIT FOR MORE THAN A YEAR TO GET A RECALL REPAIRED AND NOT TO USE THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT FOR THAT LENGTH OF TIME....",
