THIS FAILURE CAUSED ADDITIONAL FAILURES OF THE STARTER AND SPARK PLUGS.  ALSO THE LOWER INTAKE MANIFOLD WAS REPLACED WITHOUT FAILING WITH A REDESIGNED PART.  THIS LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT GM THINKS THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THESE MANIFOLDS THAT THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED WITH REDESIGNED PARTS EVEN IF THEY DON'T FAIL.  TOTAL COST OF REPAIRS WAS $1600.   *NLM",
