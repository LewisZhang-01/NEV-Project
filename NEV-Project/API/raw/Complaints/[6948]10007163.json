THE LEFT AND RIGHT REAR TURN SIGNAL ELECTRICAL ASSEMBLIES FAILED WITHIN 2 WEEKS OF EACH OTHER AND FURTHER DIAGNOSIS REVEALED AN OPEN CIRCUIT IN EACH ASSEMBLY WHICH CAUSED THE TURN SIGNAL TO FAIL TO FLASH. BULB TESTED GOOD. THE PERSONAL AT THE AUTO PARTS STORE STATED THEY HAD A LOT OF THESE ASSEMBLIES BEING REQUESTED FOR REPLACEMENT. I HAVE NEVER HAD A WRECK WITH MY VEHICLE. I BELIEVE THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT BY GM SUPPLIER BECAUSE THE BRAKE LIGHT PORTION WOULD CONTINUE TO WORK.  *JB  *NLM    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*764581",
