I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEFROST THE WINDSHIELD IF IT WERE NEEDED (WHICH COULD IMPAIR DRIVING). I CALLED ON-STAR TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM WHILE I WAS DRIVING AND THEY DETERMINED THERE WERE PROBLEMS IN THE SYSTEM AND SUGGEST ME TO SEE THE DEALER. LATER ON IN THE SAME DAY, THE HEATER WORKED (ONLY ON THE DRIVER''S SIDE) AFTER THE CAR PARKED TWICE.",
