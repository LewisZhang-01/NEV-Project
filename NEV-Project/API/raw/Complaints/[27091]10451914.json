WE IN TURN TOOK IT INTO HONDA TO HAVE IT CHECKED SEVERAL TIMES AND TO TEST DRIVE, I EVEN DROVE THE HONDA WHILE THE SERVICE MAN WAS IN THE CAR AND IT WOULD NOT SHUDDER.  IT IS STILL HAVING THE SHUDDER PROBLEMS, I AM TAKING IT IN FOR THE 4TH TIME FOR SERVICE AND OIL CHANGE AND MAYBE THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT CAN TELL ME WHAT IS WRONG AND WHY IT SHUDDERS.  FROM RESEARCH WE HAVE FOUND OUT THAT WE ARE NOT THE ONLY HONDA PILOT OWNERS WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM. THERE ARE 98 TOTAL DISCUSSIONS ON THIS WEBSITE (  HTTP://WWW.EDMUNDS.COM/HONDA/PILOT/2005/CONSUMER-DISCUSSIONS.HTML)  DISCUSSING THE SAME PROBLEMS WE ARE HAVING, I TRULY HOPE THAT HONDA IS GOING TO STAND GOOD ON TAKING CARE OF THIS PROBLEM OR WE WILL NO LONGER PURCHASE ANOTHER HONDA.  WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IT IS THE TORQUE CONVERTER.  *TR",
