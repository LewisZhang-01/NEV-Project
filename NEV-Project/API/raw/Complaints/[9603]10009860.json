        "summary": "ON SEPT. 27, 2002 ABOUT 40 MILES BEFORE MY ACTUAL BLOW OUT, I FELT AND HEARD SOMETHING ON THE DRIVERS' SIDE REAR TIRE.  I THOUGHT IT WAS A ROCK FROM MY WHEEL WELL, EXCEPT I WAS ON A HIGHWAY WITH NO ROCKS TO BE FOUND.  MY TRUCK BEGAN TO SHAKE SO I KEPT MY SPEED AT ABOUT 60 MPH.  ABOUT 40 MILES LATER, MY REAR DRIVER'S SIDE TIRE BLEW OUT.  ON JULY 3, 2002 I HAD ALL OF MY TIRES CHECKED BECAUSE I FELT UNSAFE IN MY TRUCK.  MY TIRES DID NOT DRIVE SMOOTHLY ANYMORE.  THE FACTORY REP. FROM FIRESTONE WAS THERE AND PERSONALLY CHECKED MY TIRES AND TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE FINE CONDITION AND I HAD A LOT OF WEAR LEFT ON THEM.  HE TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD ROTATE AND BALANCE MY TIRES.  I SUBMITTED A REPORT TO FIRESTONE ASKING FOR THEM TO PAY MY TRUCK REPAIR AND THE COST OF MY TIRES PRO-RATED.  THEY HAVE DENIED MY CLAIM AND STATED THAT I HIT SOMETHING THAT MADE MY TIRE BLOW LIKE IT DID.  I HAVE SENT THEM A LETTER TO ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION.  PLEASE ADVISE.  *JB    ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS*****770178",
