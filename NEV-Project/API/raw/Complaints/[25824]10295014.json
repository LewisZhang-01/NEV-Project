A LOCAL DEALER DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A BAD FRONT WHEEL BEARING. HE CHANGE THE BEARING, WHICH I THEN DISASSEMBLED AND INSPECTED. THE BEARING LOOKED SUFFICIENTLY FINE, EXCEPT FOR A LACK OF GREASE. TWO DAYS LATER I REMOVED THE REMAINING FRONT WHEEL BEARING, WITH THE THOUGHT OF GETTING GREASE INTO IT. BUT UPON REMOVING THE BEARING, I FOUND RADIAL FREE PLAY AND EXCESSIVE END PLAY, THE BEARING WAS BEYOND A SAFE USABLE CONDITION, AND ALSO HAD TO BE REPLACED.  I HAVE SINCE FOUND OUT THAT THERE WERE REPORTS OF INSUFFICIENT LUBRICATION, IN DODGE TRUCK WHEEL BEARINGS, AND WOULD LIKE TO ADD MY PROBLEM TO THE LIST. *TR",
