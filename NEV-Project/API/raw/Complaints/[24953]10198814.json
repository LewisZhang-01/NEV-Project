AT TIME OF FAILURE AT 56,000 MILES THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL OIL WILL SLOWLY LEAK AND CAUSE THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL TO LOSE FLUID AND FAIL. NISSAN REPLACED SPACER AXLE (43070-7S200), BEARING (40210-7S210), AND SEAL (43252-7S200). AS THIS SEEMED TO BE A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE NISSAN TITAN, NISSAN SHOULD ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND OFFER A PERMANENT FIX SO IT WOULD NOT BE FACED WITH THE SAFETY ISSUE IN THE FUTURE.  *TR",
