        "summary": "THE TRANSFER CASE ON THE 4 WHEEL DRIVE UNIT MAKES A \"CREAKING\" NOISE AFTER IT HAS BEEN DRIVEN FOR MORE THAN 20 MILES.  THE NOISE IS MOST EVIDENT ON COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP AND THEN TURNING (EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT) AFTER ABOUT 20 MILES.  I HAVE REPLACED THE DRIVE SHAFT UNIVERSALS AND INSPECTED THE CV JOINT IN AN EFFORT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.  I HAVE ALSO HAD THE REAR TRANSFER CASE SEAL REPLACED, ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN LEAKING FLUID AT A VERY SLOW RATE SINCE IT WAS REPLACED BY MY MECHANIC.  I  HAD TWO DIFFERENT MECHANICS INSPECT THE PROBLEM AND THEY ARE UNABLE TO ISOLATE THE PROBLEM OTHER THAN IT EMANATES FROM THE AREA OF THE TRANSFER CASE.  THE VEHICLE HAS LESS THAN 65,000 MILES ON IT, A TRANSFER CASE SHOULD NOT FAIL WITH MILEAGE SO LOW.*JB",
