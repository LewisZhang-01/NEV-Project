THE SOUCE OF THE PROBLEM (AS REPORTED BY MANY CONSUMERS ABOUT THE SAME VEHICLE) IS A SOFTWARE DEFECT IN THE EMISSIONS CONTROL MODULE THAT CAUSE FUEL TO BE WITHHELD FROM THE ENGINE. HONDA KNEW OF THIS PROBLEM WHEN THEY SOLD THIS DANGEROUS CAR TO ME AND DID IT ANYWAY. THEY CLAIM THAT THEY ARE NAVIGATING THE EPA TO GET APPROVAL, BUT MY DEALING HAVE BEEN CONTENTIOUS AT BEST IN GETTING INFORMATION. THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ISSUED BECAUSE THIS IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM. THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FINES HAVE OBVIOUSLY NOT TAUGHT THEM ANY MORE RESPECT FOR CONSUMERS.",
