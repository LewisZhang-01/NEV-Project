CONSUMER WAS UPSET ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE BRAKES DID NOT LAST LONG. WHEN THE ROTORS WERE TAKEN OFF THEY WERE JUST PIECES OF METAL MISSING, AND THEY ALL WERE RUSTY, ESPECIALLY ON THE INSIDE WHERE THE ANTI LOCK BRAKES OPERATED. *AK  CONSUMER SAID THAT THE FRONT ROTOR WAS TOO THIN TO BE TURNED, THE BRAKE PAD WAS NOT WORN OUT AND IT WAS POOR METAL FROM THE MANUFACTURER. CONSUMER TALKED TO SEVERAL OTHER SILVERADO VEHICLE OWNERS AND THEY EITHER HAD THE SAME PROBLEM OR DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE SITUATION UNTIL AFTER THEY GOT THERE VEHICLE CHECKED OUT, AND WAS INFORMED OF THE SAME PROBLEM. CONSUMER SAID THAT THE DEALERSHIP WAS AWARE OF SIMILAR INCIDENTS SUCH AS THIS ONE BECAUSE OF OTHER SILVERADO OWNERS.*SB",
