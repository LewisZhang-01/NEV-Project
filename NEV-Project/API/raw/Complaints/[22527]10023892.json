        "summary": "LAST WEEK ON 6-20-03 I PULLED OUT ONTO STATE ROAD 2 IN VALPARAISO AND MY 2001 VOLKSWAGEN JETTA TDI WOULD NOT ACCELERATE.  I HAD MY 6-YEAR-OLD SON IN THE CAR AND HAD TO PULL OVER TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD TO AVOID BEING HIT.  THE CAR IS UNDRIVEABLE.  A MECHANIC HAS DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A FAULTY TURBO DIESEL SYSTEM.  THIS SYSTEM WAS INSTALLED NEW IN THE 2001 JETTA AND HAD PREVIOUSLY NEVER BEEN INSTALLED IN ANY OTHER VOLKSWAGEN.  MY MECHANIC INDICATES THE NEW SYSTEM IS FAULTY AND AS A RESULT, FUEL IS NOT BURNED CLEANLY.  THE ENTIRE ENGINE, INTAKE MANIFOLD, AND VALVES ARE CLOGGED WITH CARBON.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD I NEED A NEW ENGINE.  MY MECHANIC HAS DIAGNOSED THE SAME PROBLEM IN OTHER 2001 JETTAS AND STATES THAT THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO HIM TO BE UNIVERSAL IN THIS YEAR AND MODEL. THIS CAR IS ONLY TWO YEARS OLD AND I OWE $15,000 ON IT.  IT ONLY HAS 47,000 MILES ON IT.  VOLKSWAGEN REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THERE'S A PROBLEM.  I FEAR PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE KILLED IN THIS CAR IF THE PROBLEM IS NOT IDENTIFIED AND RECTIFIED.  *JB",
