I AM CONCERNED THAT IF THIS VEHICLE WERE IN AN ACCIDENT THE METAL WOULD IMPALE THE DRIVER.  I HAVE CONTACTED GENERAL MOTORS SEVERAL TIMES ONLY FOR THEM TO TELL ME SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO BE INJURED BEFORE THEY WOULD RECONGNIZE THIS AS A PROBLEM.  A RELATIVE HAS THE EXACT SAME MINI-VAN (YEAR AND MODEL) AND IS EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM.  I HAVE RECEIVED AN ESTIMATE OF REPAIR FROM AN INDEPENDENT AUTO UPHOLSTERY SHOP AND FOUND IT INTERESTING THAT WHEN I TOLD THE GENTLEMAN WHAT TYPE OF VEHICLE IT WAS HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS PRIOR TO LOOKING AT THE VEHICLE.  HE INDICATED THAT HE HAS REPAIRED MANY OF THESE.  WE ALSO FOUND OUT THAT GENERAL MOTORS HAS REDESIGNED THE DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS SEATS IN THE SILHOUETTE, EITHER PROVIDING MORE SEAT FRAME PROTECTION OR REMOVING THE METAL PORTION THAT IS PROTRUDING FROM MY VEHICLE.",
