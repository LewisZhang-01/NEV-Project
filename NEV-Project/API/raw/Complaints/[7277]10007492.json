HE CALLED AND SAID THE SNAP RING POPPED OUT OF THE SERVO CASE CAUSING THE TRANSMISSION TO FAIL. THEY REPAIRED IT AND SAID IT WAS FIXED, STARTED HOME AND GOT 15 MILES WHEN IT BLEW AGAIN. HAD IT TOWED BACK AND THEY TRIED TO REPAIR IT AGAIN BUT SAID THEY COULD NOT , NEEDED A NEW TRANNY. I QUESTIONED THEM THAT A 51,000 MILES, THE PART SHOULD NOT HAVE FAILED, THEY COULD NOT GIVE ME AN ANSWER. I TOOK IT SOME WHERE ELSE TO BE REPAIRED. THE PERSON SAID THAT THERE IS TO MUCH PRESSURE THAT IT BLEW IT OUT. I FEEL THAT THE PART WAS DEFECTIVE.  *PH    **DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS**768335",
