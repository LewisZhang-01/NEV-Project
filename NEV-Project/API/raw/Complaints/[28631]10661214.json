MY LEFT BUTT CHEEK WAS BURNED A LITTLE BUT I WAS OTHERWISE UNINJURED. I READ ONLINE THAT A TON OF OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME/SIMILAR MAKE AND MODEL CAR AS ME HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. THE DEALER SAID IT WOULD COST ABOUT $2000 TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE SEAT. THERE IS CLEARLY A MAJOR FLAW IN THE SEAT HEATER AND IT COULD POSE A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE SHOULD A FIRE OCCUR AND THE DRIVER IS NOT ABLE TO LEAVE THE CAR RIGHT AWAY. BMW SHOULD RECALL AND/OR PAY FOR THE REPLACEMENT/REPAIR OF THE SEAT.  *TR",
