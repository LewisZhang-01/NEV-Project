THIS STARTED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO ON ONE DOOR, BUT HAS GOTTEN PROGRESSIVELY WORSE SUCH THAT 70-80 PERCENT OF THE TIME THE CHILD LOCKS ON BOTH DOORS WILL ACTIVATE WHILE DRIVING AND PEOPLE CANNOT EXIT THE SECOND SEAT WITHOUT SOMEONE OPENING THE DOOR FROM THE OUTSIDE. ONCE THE DOOR IS OPENED, THE CHILD LOCK LEVER CAN BE SET TO THE NON-LOCK POSITION, BUT UPON DRIVING THE CAR AGAIN, THE LOCKS ACTIVATE. THIS IS A SEVERE SAFETY PROBLEM, AND BY REVIEWING THE NHTSA WEBSITE AND TALKING TO OTHER EXPEDITION OWNERS, IT IS A VERY COMMON OCCURRENCE IN THIS MODEL.    *NLM",
