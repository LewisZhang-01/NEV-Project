        "summary": "I HAVE A 2014  LEXUS GX 460 WHICH HAS AN OBVIOUS LEAN TO THE RIGHT/PASSENGER SIDE. THE PASSENGER SIDE SITS APPROXIMATELY 1\" LOWER IN THE FRONT. WHEN I BRAKE THE VEHICLE PULLS HARD TO THE RIGHT EVERY TIME. THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN FOR ME DUE NOT KNOWING IF THE VEHICLE WILL OVERTURN IF INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT/HARD BRAKING. IT IS ALSO A CONCERN THAT PARTS WILL EVENTUALLY WEAR QUICKER ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE DUE TO THE SUBSTANTIAL LEAN CAUSING SAFETY CONCERNS DOWN THE ROAD. I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO A CERTIFIED LEXUS DEALER WHO ADVISES THAT LEXUS ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN FOR THIS EXACT ISSUE. LEXUS FURTHER ADVISED ME THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT MY LEAN WAS NOT IN LEXUS SPECIFICATIONS TO BE FIXED WITH THE NEW PART THAT LEXUS HAS ALREADY ENGINEERED TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. THEY FURTHER ADVISED ME THAT I CAN BRING THE VEHICLE BACK AT A LATER DATE AND THEY WILL REMEASURE THE LEAN TO SEE IF IT FALLS UNDER THE REPAIR/REPLACE BULLETIN. IF IT GETS WORSE BY THE MILEAGE DEAD LINE THEN I CAN GET IT FIXED IF NOT I AM TOLD THAT NOTHING CAN BE DONE. IT IS MY OPTION THAT THIS VEHICLE HAS A VALID SAFETY CONCERN DUE TO THE VEHICLE LEANING TO ONE SIDE. THIS LARGE AND HEAVY SUV IS ALREADY A TOP HEAVY VEHICLE AND LEXUS CLEARLY KNOWS THAT IT IS AN ISSUE DUE TO THE SERVICE BULLETIN THAT THEY PUT OUT.",
