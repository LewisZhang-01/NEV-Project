THE ONLY THING THAT SEEMS TO CLEAR THE WINDOWS IS TO TURN ON THE ELECTRIC. REAR WINDOW DEFOGGER AND RAISE AND LOWER THE SIDE WINDOWS SEVERAL TIME. THE FOG ON THE WINDOWS GETS SO BAD SOMETIME THAT WE WILL ONLY HAVE TWO ROUND CIRCLES ON THE FRONT WINDSHIELD TO SEE OUT OF. WE TOOK IT BACK TO OUT DEALER AND THEY TOLD US IT WAS BECAUSE OF DIRTY WINDOWS. THEY CLEANED THE WINDOWS AND WE LEFT, ONLY TO HAVE THEM FOG UP AGAIN ABOUT 8 MILES DOWN THE ROAD. WE HAVE TRIED DIFFERENT THINGS TO KEEP THE WINDSHIELD CLEAR SUCH AS TURNING ON THE AIR CONDITIONER WHILE THE DEFROSTER IS ON AND TURNING UP THE FAN, BUT NOTHING WORKS LIKE RAISING AND LOWERING THE SIDE WINDOWS. WE KNOW OF SOMEONE ELSE THAT OWNS A MALIBU AND THEY HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. WE HAVE OWNED THE CAR FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS AND THIS HAPPENS SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK EXCEPT DURING THE SUMMER.*JB",
