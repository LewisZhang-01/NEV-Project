        "summary": "THIS NOTE IS TO ACCOMPANY THE MOTOR VEHICLE DEFECT NOTIFICATION FOR MY 2002 DURANGO, VIN 1B8HR48N42F188761. THIS IS THE SECOND DEFECTIVE DURANGO I HAVE PURCHASED IN THE LAST FIVE MONTHS AND IT PRESENTS A SAFETY ISSUE.     THE FIRST DURANGO WAS ONLY GOOD FOR FOUR DAYS AND LESS THAN 400 MILES. WE EXPERIENCED MULTIPLE PROBLEMS WITH IT TO INCLUDE TRANSMISSION SHIFTING, ENGINE VIBRATIONS, AND POOR HANDLING PROBLEMS. IT WAS DETERMINED BY THE DEALER THAT MULTIPLE COMPUTERS WERE BAD AND IT WOULD TAKE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE. AS A SOLUTION, THE DEALER PROVIDED US ANOTHER VEHICLE.    THE CURRENT DURANGO IS ONLY FIVE MONTHS OLD AND HAS LESS THAN 5000 MILES. IT HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP EVERY WEEKEND FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS FOR THE SAME PROBLEM. AS THE VEHICLE IS MOVING, IT DROPS TO FIRST GEAR COMING TO AN ALMOST COMPLETE STOP, LAUNCHING THE OCCUPANTS FORWARD DUE TO THE SUDDEN SPEED REDUCTION. THIS IN ITSELF IS A SAFETY ISSUE SINCE OCCUPANTS COULD GET HURT, NOT TO MENTION LOSS OF CONTROL BY THE DRIVER, POSSIBLY CAUSING AN ACCIDENT, OR THE VEHICLE BEEN HIT FROM BEHIND.     IN ADDITION TO COMING TO AN ALMOST COMPLETE STOP, THE VEHICLE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AND THE VEHICLE LOCKS THE TRANSMISSION ON FIRST GEAR (IF IT MOVES AT ALL SINCE THE SECOND TIME IT MALFUNCTIONED, IT WOULD ONLY GO IN REVERSE AND HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE DEALER).     PROBLEMS CONTINUE WITH THE VEHICLE. THE DEALER HAS INDICATED THAT THERE IS A SOFTWARE PROBLEM WITH THE TRANSMISSION MODULE BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE A FIX FOR IT YET!!!!! TS",
