        "summary": "I PURCHASED THE CAR IN MARCH, IT WAS MY FIRST TIME BUYING A NEW CAR. WITHIN THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER BUYING THE CAR I NOTICED A FEW RATTLING AND CLANKING NOISES. I BELIEVED THIS TO BE THE CARS MOVING PARTS, AND DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT AT THE TIME, ESPECIALLY SINCE I WAS USED TO DRIVING USED CARS THAT SOUNDED WORSE. AFTER A FEW WEEKS, I NOTICED THAT THE NOISES WHERE NOTICEABLY LOUDER, ALONG WITH A LOUD KNOCKING NOISE WHEN I TURNED THE STEERING WHEEL. THE DEALERSHIP THAT I PURCHASED THE CAR FROM (UNIVERSAL HYUNDAI IN ORLANDO) WAS BOOKED UP SO I MADE AN APPOINTMENT AT ORLANDO HYUNDAI. SHORTLY AFTER BRINGING MY CAR IN, AND HAVING THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT LOOK AT THE CAR, I WAS TOLD THAT THE CAR WAS SOLD TO ME DEFECTIVE, THAT \"THE LEFT AND RIGHT INNER TIRE RODS AND LOCK NUTS WERE LOOSE, THREADS WERE DAMAGED, AND THE LOCK NUTS WERE LEFT LOOSE FROM THE FACTORY\". THE SERVICE MANAGER EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THIS COULD HAVE EASILY CAUSED AN ACCIDENT, AND THAT \"ONE TIRE WOULD'VE WENT ONE WAY AND THE OTHER TIRE WOULD'VE WENT THE OTHER WAY, CAUSING YOUR CAR TO COME TO A SUDDEN HALT\". THIS MIGHT HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT, AND KNOWING THAT I WAS DRIVING THAT CAR ON THE HIGHWAY, TAKING TRIPS WITH MY FAMILY AND CHILDREN, WHILE THE CAR WAS DEFECTIVE WAS VERY SCARY AND UPSETTING. I WAS VERY EXCITED ABOUT PURCHASING A NEW CAR, AND HOPED THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS. I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND WANT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH HYUNDAI.  I HAVE THE STATEMENT FROM THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT STATING THAT THE FACTORY MADE A MISTAKE AND I PLAN ON FILING A COMPLAINT THROUGH HYUNDAI AND THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY SAFETY ADMINISTRATION.  *TR",
