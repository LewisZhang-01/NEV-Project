THE FRONT STEERING AND SUSPENSION MUST BE REPLACED. UPON SEARCHING THE INTERNET, I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THIS HAS BEEN A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH 1996 BLAZER'S AND A RECALL WAS ISSUED. I DID CONTACT CHEVROLET AND SPEAK WITH A REPRESENTATIVE ABOUT THE RECALL,HOWEVER, AFTER PROVIDING MY VEHICLE'S VIN NUMBER, I WAS TOLD THAT MY BLAZER DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR THE RECALL. I FEEL THAT THIS IS INAPPROPRIATE. IF MY VEHICLE IS EXPERIENCING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM DISCRIBED IN THE RECALL, THEN IT SHOULD QUALIFY FOR THE REMEDY. *AK",
