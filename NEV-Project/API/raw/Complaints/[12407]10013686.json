IT BUSTED UP MY STEERING WHEEL AND DASH BOARD. I LET MY INSURANCE CO. LOOK AT IT AND AN INVESTIGATOR FROM DAIMLER-CHRYSLER CAME OUT AND TOOK PICTURES OF IT. THERE WAS AND IS NO DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE. I WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE COPIES OF EVERYTHING, BUT INSTEAD WAS SENT A LETTER FROM THE MANUFACTURER DENYING RESPONSIBILITY. THE LETTER STATED THAT MY AIRBAG LIGHT HAD BEEN ON FOR A LONG TIME. THIS IS NOT TRUE. I HAD JUST HAD MY VEHICLE STATE INSPECTED AND ALL OF THOSE THING ARE CHECKED. MY CAR PASSED INSPECTION. THE MANUFACTURER WON'T RETURN MY PHONE CALLS AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY PROOF TO THEIR CLAIM. ALL THAT I WANT AND WANTED IS MY AIRBAG FIXED. I NEVER CLAIMED THAT I WAS HURT OR ANY OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS THAT WERE IN THE VAN AT THE TIME. PLEASE HELP.  *NLM",
