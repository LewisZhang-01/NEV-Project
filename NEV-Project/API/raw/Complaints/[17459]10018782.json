MECHANIC SAID THE IGNITION CYLINDER WAS FAULTY, HOWEVER WHEN HE TRIED TO REMOVE IT TO REPLACE, IT WOULD NOT COME OUT. HAD TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY. FIRST REPLACEMENT ASSEMBLY  ORDERED FROM SATURN WAS FAULTY SO HAD TO ORDER ANOTHER ONE. SATURN MECHANICS SAID THEY HAD SEEN \"SEVERAL\" OF THE SAME TYPE OF PROBLEM. I'M KEEPING THE ORIGINAL PARTS IN CASE THERE IS A RECALL. THE CAR ONLY HAS 44K MILES ON IT.  *NLM",
