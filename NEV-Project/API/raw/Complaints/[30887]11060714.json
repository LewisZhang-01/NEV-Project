NOW THE BRAKE PEDAL IS SOFT ALL OF THE TIME.  IT FEELS LIKE THE ABS IS PERMANENTLY ENGAGED.  THE CAR IS STOPPING BUT THE BRAKES ARE VERY MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN.  I HAVE READ THAT THIS MAY BE AN ISSUE WITH THE ABS SYSTEM.  IF SO, THIS MUST BE A DEFECT AS THE CAR SEEMS STUCK IN ABS MODE.",
