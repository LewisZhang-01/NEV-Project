THIS WAS WHILE UNDER WARRANTY, NOW THAT IT IS NOT UNDER WARRANTY, THE DEALERSHIP HAS ASKED ME TO PAY $188.34 TO FIX A SHORT UNDER THE AIRBAG.  THIS SHORT HAD TO EXIST PREVIOUS TO THE WARRANTY EXPIRING.  I HAVE NEVER OPENED THE STEERING WHEEL COVER.  ALSO, WHEN VEHICLE WAS LESS THAN 2 YEARS OLD, THE BRAKES WOULD PULSE AND MAKE HEAVY RUMBLING NOISE WHENEVER TRYING TO DEPRESS THE BRAKES GOING DOWN A VERY MINOR HILL.  HAD DEALER REPLACE PADS, STILL EXHIBITED SAME BEHAVIOR. *JB",
