IT WORRIES ME THAT MY SEAT BELT DOESN'T WORK PROPERLY AND COULD FAIL TO PROTECT ME IN AN ACCIDENT. THIS HAPPENED  IN AUGUST 2017. I DRIVE A TOYOTA COROLLA S 2014. MY CAR ALSO HAS A NON FUNCTIONAL AUDIO SYSTEM AND NON FUNCTIONING CHARGER OUTLET. THIS IS A HAZARD BECAUSE I USUALLY TRAVEL AND NEED MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM FUNCTIONING TO GET TO PLACES. DUE TO A NON FUNCTIONAL AUDIO SYSTEM I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO NAVIGATION. I USE MY PHONE AS NAVIGATION AND WHEN MY PHONE BATTERY DIES I HAVE NO WAY OF PLUGGING IT TO CHARGE IN MY CAR. ON CERTAIN OCCASIONS I'VE FOUND MYSELF HAVING TO PULL OVER IN UNFAMILIAR CITIES JUST TO LOOK FOR A PLACE WHERE I CAN PLUG MY PHONE IN TO GET BATTERY, PUT THE NAVIGATION AND CONTINUE TO MY DESTINATION. IT'S REALLY INCONVENIENT AND I DON'T FEEL SAFE HAVING TO TAKE THESE MEASURES.",
