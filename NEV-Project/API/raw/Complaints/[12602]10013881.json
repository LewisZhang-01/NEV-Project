        "summary": "I HAVE A 1999 CHYSLER CONCORDE, 2.7 LITER, WITH 85,000 MILES.  THE ENGINE BEGAN KNOCKING AND THEN THE OIL LIGHT THEN CAME ON.  I STOPPED THE CAR ON THE EXPRESSWAY.  AFTER SITTING I COULD RESTART THE ENGINE, DRIVE A SHORT DISTANCE (.1 MILES) BEFORE THE LIGHT WOULD COME ON AGAIN UNTIL I GOT TO AN EXIT.  THE CAR WAS THEN TOWED TO A GARAGE.    THEY HAVE DIAGNOSED LIKELY BEARING FAILURE REQUIRING AN ENGINE REBUILD.  THE OIL PRESSURE IS DROPPING AS THE ENGINE WARMS UP.  THEY FOUND METAL SHAVINGS (BRASS)  IN THE OIL.  UNTIL THIS PROBLEM, THE ENGINE HAD NOT KNOCKED OR HAD ANY VALVE NOISE OR OTHER ISSUES INDICATING LOW OIL PRESSURE.  I HAVE GENERALLY CHANGED THE OIL EVERY 3,000 MILES.  THIS FAILURE SEEMS PREMATURE AND WITHOUT WARNING.    THE SAFETY ISSUE IS THAT MOTORISTS ARE LEFT STRANDED ON THE EXPRESSWAY DUE A POSSIBLE DEFECT INVOLVING THE MATERIALS USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF THIS PARTICULAR ENGINE.  WHILE THE MILEAGE EXCEEDS THE MANUFACTURERS WARRANTY, THE FAILURE IS EXTREMELY PREMATURE.",
