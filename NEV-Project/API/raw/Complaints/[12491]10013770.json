        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 2003 LAND ROVER FREELANDER.  IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER OTHER DRIVERS COMMENTED TO ME THAT MY BRAKE LIGHTS AND TURN-SIGNALS WERE TO LOW TO BE SEEN, THAT I REALIZED THEY WERE ON THE BUMPER, NOT UP WHERE I THOUGHT THEY WERE.  THESE LIGHTS ARE ONLY 20 INCHES OFF THE GROUND.  IN THIS DAY AND AGE WITH SO MANY HIGH PROFILE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD, THIS HEIGHT IS WELL BELOW THESE DRIVERS FIELD OF VISION.  I REALIZE LAND ROVER DID THIS BECAUSE OF THE SPARE TIRE, AND THE NEED TO ADHERE TO THE 45-DEGREE-INBOARD-VISIBILITY LAW.  HOWEVER, THERE FIX MADE THINGS WORSE.  THIS PROBLEM IS THE TALK OF THE INTERNET ON ALL THE INTERNET FREELANDER SITES.  EVERYONE THAT OWNS A FREELANDER IS CONCERNED, AND SOME HAVE GONE SO FAR AS TO WIRE THE BRAKES TO THE UPPER LIGHTS.  I FEEL THIS 45-DEGREE LAW IS DANGEROUS, AND SHOULD BE ENDED OR AT LEAST MODIFIED TO AN ANGLE OF 30-DEGREES SO FREELANDER OWNERS CAN HAVE THEIR LIGHTS MODIFIED LEGALLY.  SURE THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY MAJOR ACCIDENTS SO FAR, BUT MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE FREELANDER OWNERS ARE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, AND ARE EXTRA CAUTIOUS.  I AM SURE WE ALL WOULD LIKE TO BE LESS PARANOID WHEN WE USE OUR BRAKES AND TURN-SIGNALS. *JB",
