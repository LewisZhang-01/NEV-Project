NOTHING HAPPENS AT ALL WHEN PUSHING THE BUTTONS.  THE VEHICLE STAYS IN 2 WHEEL DRIVE ALL THE TIME.  I HAD IT CHECKED AND I WAS TOLD THE ENCODER MOTOR AND OR SOLENOID WAS NO GOOD.  I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THERE MIGHT BE A SILENT RECALL ON THIS PROBLEM.  I PHONED A CHEVROLET DEALER AND THEY DIDN'T KNOW OF ANY SUCH RECALL!  THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE REPAIR THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED, THAT THE CONSUMER SHOULD NOT HAVE TO UNDERTAKE.  MY VEHICLE IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM FIXED BY THE MANUFACTURER.  BESIDES THE FACT THAT IF I WANTED TO TRADE THE VEHICLE, THIS WOULD BE A GREAT DEPRECIATION ON A TRADE-IN.  I DON'T KNOW WHO TO TALK TO, AND FIND OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS REPAIR AND TO HAVE THE MANUFACTURER LIABLE FOR THE EXPENSE.*JB",
