        "summary": "MY 2002 DODGE RAM QUAD CAB PICKUP HAS 49,000 MILES ON IT.  I RECENTLY BROUGHT IT IN TO GET AN ALIGNMENT AND BRAKES CHECKED, WHEN THE SERVICE WRITER INFORMED MY THAT MY RACK AND PINION STEERING WAS LEAKING.  49,000 MILES!  IF THE STEERING IS LOST, THE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE SERIOUS, AND EVEN FATAL.  I CALLED DODGE CORPORATE FOR OUT OF WARRANTY ASSISTANCE, AND AFTER SITTING ON HOLD FOR 30 MINUTES, THEY CAME BACK TO TELL ME BECAUSE OF PROCEDURE, THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HELP ME.  THE COST TO FIX THIS IS $675 PARTS AND LABOR.  I FEEL THAT A FOUR WHEEL DRIVE TRUCK SHOULD HAVE IT'S RACK AND PINION LAST LONGER THAN 49,000 MILES, AND THAT DODGE SHOULD STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND HELP OUT.  DODGE OBVIOUSLY DOES NOT FEEL THAT WAY.  *NM",
