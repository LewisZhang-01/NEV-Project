        "summary": "I HAVE A 2005 FORD F550 CREW CAB WITH 36,000 MILES.  THE VEHICLE IS FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY AND HAS NEVER HAD A HEAVY LOAD ON IT.  MY VEHICLES ARE METICULOULY MAINTAINED AND TIRE PRESSURE CHECKED MONTHLY AND PRIOR TO ANY LONGER TRIP.  TIRE PRESSURE WAS CHECKED THE DAY PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT.  WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 70 MPH ON THE FREEWAY, THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE SUSTAINED A FULL BLOWOUT, CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE FENDER/WHEELWELL AREAS.  MY VEHICLE ALMOST ROLLED BUT WAS ABLE TO CORRECT IT WITHOUT A CRASH.  ORIGINAL TIRES ARE CONTINENTIAL 225/70R 19.5 WITH EXCELLENT RUBBER STILL ON THE TIRES.  VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO A GOODYEAR DEALER WHO SAID THE TIRE OBVIOUSLY HAD A DEFECT.  INSPECTION OF THE OTHER TIRES REVEALED HEAVY CRACKS IN THE GROVES.  HAD TO REPLACE THE TIRES FOR OBVIOUS SAFETY REASONS AT A SUBSTANTIAL COST.  READ NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS WITH THIS TIRE.  CONTINENTIAL SHOULD REIMBUSE THE COST OF THE TIRES AND THE COST OF THE REPAIRS TO MY TRUCK AND TOWING.  TRIP WAS DELAYED 6 HOURS WHILE WAITING FOR THE TOW AND REPAIRS.  I DO NOT HAVE THE DAMAGED TIRE, BUT HAVE SEVERAL PHOTOGRAPHS SHOWING THE DAMAGE.  *TR",
