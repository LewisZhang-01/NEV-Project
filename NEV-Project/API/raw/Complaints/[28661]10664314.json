THIS HAPPENED REPEATEDLY EVEN AFTER TURNING THE CAR OFF FOR HOURS AND RESTARTING. PICTURES WERE TAKEN OF THE MESSAGES AND IT WAS DROPPED AT THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF THE LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP. THEY ORIGINALLY THOUGHT IT WAS A BAD ABS SENSOR, BUT UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, SOMETHING IS REALLY WRONG IN THE COMPUTER AND SOME OTHER MODULES, THEY DID NOT EVEN GIVE US A TIME FRAME FOR COMPLETION. THIS IS NEXT YEARS MODEL AND WE HAVE ONLY OWNED IT FOR 1 MONTH, NOT A GOOD SIGN. NOT SURE IF OTHER PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS ISSUE, BUT THEY MIGHT SOON. THE DEALERSHIP WOULD ALSO NOT SAY IF IT WAS/IS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE WITH ALL OF THE ERRORS POPPING UP.  *TR",
