        "summary": "WHILE MY WIFE WAS DRIVING OUR 2000 FORD WINDSTAR DOWN THE HIGHWAY AFTER PICKING MY SON UP FROM SCHOOL, SHE NOTICED THAT AT LEAST 3 CARS HAD PASSED HER WITH THEIR WINDSHIELD WIPERS ON DURING A PERFECTLY CLEAR DAY.  SHE LOOKED OUT THE BACK WINDOW AND COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING.    WE LATER FOUND OUT THE HOT ENGINE COOLANT WAS SPRAYING OUT FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE VEHICLE AND SPRAYING ONTO THE TRAILING CARS CREATING A VISIBILITY HAZARD.  THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS THE FAILURE OF THE HEAD GASKET ON THE WINDSTAR.    THIS COULD HAVE HAD A VERY SERIOUS IMPACT ON OTHER DRIVERS OR MY WIFE DUE TO A LACK OF VISIBILITY DUE TO THE ENGINE COOLANT SPRAYING OVER THE WINDSHIELDS OF OTHER VEHICLES.    FORD MOTOR COMPANY UNDER WENT A HUGE RECALL CAMPAIGN IN 2000 FOR HEAD GASKET FAILURES IN SEVERAL VEHICLES FOR MODEL YEARS 1996-1999.  FORD CLAIMS THEY RESOLVED THE PROBLEM WITH THE HEAD GASKETS, BUT CONSIDERING I HAD A FAILURE AT LESS THAN 50,000 MILES THAT WARRANTED AN ENGINE REPLACEMENT I DON'T BELIEVE THE ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED.  *JB",
