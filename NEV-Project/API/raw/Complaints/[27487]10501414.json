ON FEB 17 2013 IT DID THE SAME EXACT THING,  I STOPPED AND  RESTARTED THE ENGINE SEVERAL TIMES IN THE 40 MINUTE DRIVE OF 3 MILES BACK HOME BUT THAT DID NOT HELP.   AFTER THE CAR SET FOR SEVERAL HOURS IT STARTED AND  RAN CORRECTLY. RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET SHOWED HUNDREDS OF THE SAME PROBLEM AND REPLACING THE THROTTLE BODY CORRECTED THE TROUBLE. ON FEB 18, 2013 I TOOK IT TO THE FORD DEALER AND FROM ONLY MY DESCRIPTION WAS TOLD THAT THE THROTTLE BODY WAS THE PROBLEM, THEY HAD 3 IN STOCK  AND MY THREE YEAR WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED ON FEB 21, 2013, LESS THAN A MONTH OUT OF WARRANTY AND IT WOULD NOT BE COVERED SO I DROVE THE CAR BACK HOME, I CALLED A DIFFERENT FORD DEALER WHO SOLD ME THE THROTTLE BODY AT A DISCOUNT. IT TOOK ME ABOUT TEN MINUTES TO INSTALL THE THROTTLE BODY,  AND THE CAR IS STILL RUNNING AS IT SHOULD.  *TR",
