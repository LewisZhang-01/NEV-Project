TWO WEEKS LATER THE ENGINE WOULD NOT TURN OVER, BUT EVENTUALLY DID AFTER A JUMP START.  THE FOLLOWING TWO WEEKS, WHEN THE KEY WAS TURNED TO TRY AND START THE ENGINE, ALL THAT HAPPENED WAS A CLICKING NOISE.  JUMP STARTING WAS INEFFECTIVE.  IT WAS TOWED AGAIN TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE DIAGNOSIS IS ENGINE SIEZURE.  THE VEHICLE IS FOUR YEARS OLD, WITH ~48,000 MILES, AND PERFECT SERVICE RECORDS.  THE DEALER RECOMMENDS REPLACING THE ENTIRE ENGINE IN ORDER FOR THE VEHICLE TO RUN AGAIN.",
