        "summary": "I BEGAN HAVING ISSUES WITH MY CAR CONSTANTLY JERKING AS THE CAR ACCELERATED UP TO 40MPH. I ASSUMED I MUST HAVE PUT BAD GAS IN MY CAR SINCE I VISITED A GAS STATION I NORMALLY DO NOT FREQUENT. I TOOK THE CAR IN AND THEY CLAIMED IT WAS BAD GAS BUT HERE WE ARE A YEAR LATER WITH THE SAME ISSUES AND CLEARLY IT WAS NOT BAD GAS AND I GOT RIPPED OFF FOR REPLACING MY FUEL PUMP AND HAVING TO PAY FOR A RENTAL CAR. I HAVE WASTED OVER $2K TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE ISSUE IS WITH MY CAR AND I STILL HAVE ALL MY RECEIPTS AS PROOF. THE CAR JERKS WHEN IT IS VERY COLD OUT AND VERY HOT, MY CAR STALLED NUMEROUS OF TIMES SINCE THIS ISSUE HAS BEGAN. I HAVE HAD TONS OF DIAGNOSTICS DONE AND NO ONE CAN FIGURE OUT WHY IT IS \"MISFIRING\". I HAD MY THROTTLE BODY CLEANED, CHECKED MY FUEL LINES AND INJECTORS, HAD THE SPARK PLUGS CHECKED, AND HAD THE MAF SENSOR REPLACED TWICE. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON TWICE BUT THREW FALSE CODES SPECIFICALLY THE MAF SENSOR. I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING ONLINE FOR A YEAR AND I NOTICED OTHER SATURN AURA DRIVERS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE WITH NO HELP FROM GM OR A SOLUTION. I KEEP THE MAINTENANCE UP ON MY CAR SO I DO BELIEVE THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME SORT OF KNOWN FAILURE WITH THESE CARS. I HAD MY TRANSMISSION CHECKED AND FLUSHED AND WAS TOLD ITS IN GOOD CONDITION. SO EITHER THIS IS SOME SORT OF ELECTRICAL ISSUE OR A BAD PART THAT IS NOT BEING RECALLED. I WOULD LIKE FOR RECALL TO BE MADE ON THIS MODEL SINCE NUMEROUS OF DRIVERS HAVE REPORTED THIS ISSUE.   *TR",
