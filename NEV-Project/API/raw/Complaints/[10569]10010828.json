        "summary": "THIRD TIME IN LESS THAN 4 MONTHS THAT VEHICLE HAS HAD COMPLETE ENGINE FAILURE.  TWO INCIDENCES WHILE DRIVING.  VEHICLE WOULD NOT START FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES.  WE HAVE TAKEN IN FOR SERVICE TWICE AND ARE TOLD THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG, UNTIL WE SAW THE SAME TYPE OF COMPLAINTS LISTED AT THIS WEBSITE.  NOW THEY TELL US THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH THE PURGE CANISTER GETTING FULL OF FUEL AND ENGINE TRIES TO LEAN OUT FUEL MOISTURE, CAUSING NO FUEL TO BE DELIVERED UNTIL CANISTER DRIES OUT.  ENGINEERS ARE SUPPOSEDLY WORKING ON SOFTWARE UPDATE FOR CORRECTION.  IN THE MEANTIME, WE ARE DRIVING A VEHICLE THAT AT ANY GIVEN TIME ON THE HIGHWAY DRIVING 65 MPH COULD COMPLETELY STALL, LOCKING UP THE STEERING WHEEL AND CAUSING A MAJOR ACCIDENTS THAT COULD LEAD TO DEATH OR INJURIES FOR LIFE.  I REQUESTED TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER OF OUR DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOTALLY IGNORED AS HE STOOD AROUND THE SHOWROOM CHIT-CHATTING WITH ANYONE THAT WALKED BY.  MY WIFE IS TERRIFIED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE.  WE ARE GOING TO ASK THE DEALER FOR A DIFFERENT VEHICLE OR LOANER UNTIL OLDSMOBILE CAN FIX THE PROBLEM.  I AM APPALLED THAT GM IS BEING ALLOWED TO LET THEIR CUSTOMERS DRIVE ONE OF THEIR VEHICLES THAT COULD CAUSE DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY FROM A PROBLEM THAT IS KNOWN TO EXIST.    *NLM",
