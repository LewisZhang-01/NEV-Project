WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A COMPLETE STOP VEHICLE DOES 1 OF 3 THINGS: 1)GASPS FOR GAS AND GOES NOWHERE (DANGEROUS WHEN MAKING LEFT HAND TURNS) OR 2) TRIES TO MOVE AHEAD LIKE A CARBURETED CARE WITH VAPOR LOCK OR 3) PERFORMS NORMALLY.\"    PROBLEMS ARE MORE NOTICEABLE WHEN OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE IS HOT. I LIVE IN NEVADA. I HAVE COMPLAINED TO VW AND DEALERSHIP BASICALLY SAID THAT VW KNOWS ABOUT IT BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE. MANY ON VW FORUMS HAVE SAME PROBLEMS. THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND I'M SURPRISED NO ONE HAS BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT.   *NLM",
