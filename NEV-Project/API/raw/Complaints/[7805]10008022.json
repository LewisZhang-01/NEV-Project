        "summary": "PAINT BUBBLING UP AND PEELING - ALL AREAS OF VEHICLE.  PROBLEM STARTED ON FRONT END AND HAS NOW SPREAD FROM BUMPER TO BUMPER.  PAINT SLIDES OFF WHEN IT RAINS, WHEN I DRIVE DOWN THE STREET AND NEW CRACKS ARE APPEARING WITH INTENSIVE REGULARITY.     ATTEMPTED TO OBTAIN REPAIR UNDER WARRANTY BEGINNING IN 1999 (ACCORDING TO OWNER'S MANUAL WAS SIX YEARS FOR PAINT) ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS FROM TWO GM DEALERSHIPS AND TOLD THAT THIS WAS NOT COVERED - PAINT WAS NOT COVERED THIS LONG PERIOD.  PAINT IS ORIGINAL PAINT JOB.  FINALLY WAS ABLE TO GAIN GM DIRECT CONSUMER NUMBER AND SPOKE WITH AMANDA IN DEC 2002 - FIRST WAS TOLD THAT VEHICLE WAS TOO OLD TO REPORT DAMAGES.  WHEN REMINDING HER THAT PEELING STARTED DURING WARRANTY PERIOD SHE THEN INFORMED ME THAT IF I'D BEEN PARKING THE CAR OUT IN THE SUNSHINE AT ANYTIME (REGARDLESS OF FACT THAT VEHICLE WAS GARAGED AT HOME) THAT 'EXPOSURE TO SUNSHINE' WOULD CAUSE THIS AND WAS THEREFORE NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  FOUR YEARS AND THE PAINT BEGINS TO SEPARATE FROM THE PRIMER?  I'VE HAD TWENTY YEAR OLD CARS WITH ORIGINAL PAINT JOBS THAT LOOKED BETTER THAN THIS 'LUXURY' CAR DID AT FOUR YEARS.  THE INCIDENT DATE SHOWN IS THE ORIGINAL DATE I FIRST NOTICED THE PEELING. THE DEALER WAS FIRST CONTACTED SHORTLY AFTER.",
