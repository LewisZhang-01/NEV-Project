        "summary": "NOTICED CAR WAS LEAKING OIL; CHECKED OIL LEVEL AND OIL WASN'T EVEN REGISTERING ON THE OIL DIPSTICK.  REQUIRED TWO (2) QUARTS OF OIL TO FILL TO PROPER LEVEL.   IT APPEARS AS THOUGH THE OIL IS FINDING ITS WAY INTO THE COOLANT SYSTEM AND BEING EXPELLED FROM THE COOLANT OVERFLOW (EXPANSION) TANK.   ALMOST TWO WEEKS LATER THE VEHICLE REQUIRED ANOTHER QUART AND WAS LOSING OIL AND COOLANT AT AN ALARMING RATE (POURING OUT OF THE VEHICLE).   DEALER HAS INSISTED PROBLEM DOESN'T EXIST AND HAS ACCUSED ME OF PUTTING OIL INTO COOLANT OVERFLOW TANK.  THIS IS A BLATANT LIE ON THEIR PART TO AVOID WARRANTY LIABILITY.  HE INSIST THAT THERE IS NO WAY FOR OIL TO FIND ITS WAY BACK INTO THE COOLANT SYSTEM.   I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS STATEMENT AND IT IS UTTERLY FALSE (EITHER THE HEAD GASKET OR THE WATER JACKET COULD BE RESPONSIBLE, AMONG OTHER THINGS).   THEY REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM OR FIX IT INSTEAD INSISTING THAT THE CAR IS OPERATING ACCORDING TO FACTORY SPECIFICATION AND THAT IT IS SAFE TO DRIVE.  MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS COULD RESULT IN AN ENGINE FIRE IF THE ENGINE OVERHEATS, ENGINE SEIZURE, ETC., ANY ONE OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF LIFE, MINE OR MY FAMILY.    *TT",
