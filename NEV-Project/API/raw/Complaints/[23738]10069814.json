A CHARGE OF $90.00 HAD TO BE PAID FOR THE LABOR COST.  THEY SAID THE PROBLEM COULD HAVE BEEN BECAUSE I HAD JUS REPLACED THE CAR BATTERY. THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM AND RESET THE WARNING LIGHT. I WAS OF THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SUPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM HAS A 10 YEAR WARRANTY, THEREFORE I DON'T BELIEVE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHARGED.  THE DEALER IS ADAMANT THAT THEY PROPERLY CHARGED ME.",
