        "summary": "\"TAKATA RECALL\" MY 2014 VW EOS HAS HAD 2 MAJOR LEAKS THAT RESULTED IN WATER STANDING IN THE CAR.  I HAVE HAD TO USE A GREEN MACHINE TO VACUUM OUT THE WATER TWICE.  THE HUMIDLY WAS SO HIGH AND THE TEMPERATURE IN THE SUMMER RESULTED IN 100% HUMIDITY IN THE CAR.  THE DEALER FINALLY GOT THE LEAKS FIXED AND VW REPLACED THE CARPETS.  I AM STILL WORRIED ABOUT THE AIR BAGS AND VW WILL DO NOTHING, THE LADY TOLD ME GOVERNMENT (NHTSA) HAS NOT GIVEN A TIME LINE FOR REPAIRS AND THEIR HANDS ARE TIED.  MY CAR SETS IN THE BACK YARD I AM RELUCTANT TO DRIVE IT.  THE PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AND THE CAR HAS LESS THAN 2500 MILES. I BROUGHT THE CAR NEW AND WASTED THE MONEY YOU GUYS NEED TO STEP UP AND  GET THIS PROBLEM RESOLVED, VW SAYS EVEN WITH THE LOCATION BEING IN TENNESSEE THERE IS STILL 6 MORE YEARS BEFORE THE AIRBAG NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE HAVE TO GET KILLED OR INJURED BEFORE YOU STEP UP? I DO NOT WANT TO RISK MY LIFE ON THE CHANCE THE AIRBAG IS GOOD FOR 6 YEARS.  YOU KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM FORCE THEM TO FIX IT.",
