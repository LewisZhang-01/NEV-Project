        "summary": "THE LEFT FRONT CORNED OF THE DRIVERS SEAT FRAME BROKE OFF.  THIS MAKES THE EXTREMELY UNSTABLE AND CAUSES DANGEROUS DRIVING CONDITIONS.  I WOULD SPECULATE THAT EVEN IF THE TRACK WAS NOT BROKEN COMPLETELY OFF, THAT IF THE VEHICLE WERE HIT FROM BEHIND THE DRIVERS SEAT COULD BE THROWN BACKWARDS OR SIDEWAYS IF THE WEAKEN FRAME WOULD BREAK THE REST OF THE WAY UPON IMPACT.  I CONTACTED GENERAL MOTORS CORP (FILE #C01667539) ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND WAS TOLD TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO GROULX OLDS/GMC DEALERSHIP (MONROE MICHIGAN 734-241-3704) TO HAVE THE SEAT INSPECTED, WHICH I DID.  UPON INSPECTION OF THE SEAT FRAME, GROULX MECHANICS CONFIRMED THE FRAME HAD FAILED, BUT COULD NOT REPLACED THE FRAME WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION FROM GENERAL MOTORS CORP. UNLESS I WAS WILLING TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR MYSELF.  I TALKED TO GENERAL MOTORS CORP. REPRESENTATIVE IN CUSTOMER RELATIONS AND WAS INFORMED THAT BECAUSE OF THE MILEAGE THEY WOULD NOT STAND BEHIND REPAIR OF THIS PROBLEM.  I ASKED IF THIS MEANS THAT IF THE FRAME RUSTS IN HALF OR THE BRAKE LINES FAIL OR A WHEEL FALLS OFF BECAUSE OF DEFECTIVE EQUIPMENT.*JB    ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****732830****",
