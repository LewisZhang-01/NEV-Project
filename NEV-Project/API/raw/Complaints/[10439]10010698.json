THE SOUND IS GETTING LOUDER AND CAN BE VERY ANNOYING.   *JB  WAS SHOCKED AND SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT LEFT REAR COIL SPRING WAS BROKEN AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.    CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AND THE CODE READS 1443.  MECHANIC COULD NOT FIND ANY PROBLEM AND SAID IT MIGHT HAVE A BEEN LOOSE GAS CAP.  HE RESET THE LIGHT. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME BACK ON AFTER DRIVING 15 MILES, TOOK IT BACK TO SERVICE STATION AND GOT SAME CODE.  MECHANIC COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM AND HAS ASKED ME TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER FOR A SMOKE TEST.",
