IF THE REMOTE TRANSMITTER IS INSIDE THE VEHICLE, THE DOORS WILL NOT LOCK.\" BUT ON 5/20/15, AFTER MY SISTER PLACED HER 6 MONTH OLD BABY IN THE CHILD SAFETY SEAT IN THE BACK OF THE PARKED ACURA AND WAS READY TO DRIVE OFF, ALL DOORS WERE LOCKED WITH BABY AND THE REMOTE TRANSMITTER INSIDE THE VEHICLE. 911 WAS CALLED AND FIREFIGHTERS BROKE THE FRONT PASSENGER WINDOW TO SAVE THE BABY FROM OVERHEATING. I REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO ACURA WHO SAID IT WAS A NORMAL BEHAVIOR, EVEN THOUGH ITS OWNER'S GUIDE SAYS THE OPPOSITE. ACURA PEOPLE SAID THEY HAD A VIDEO SHOWING THE DOORS WOULD LOCK WITH THE REMOTE TRANSMITTER INSIDE VEHICLE, HOWEVER THAT WAS NOT PUBLIC INFORMATION. THAT MAKES ME WONDER - IF THE REMOTE TRANSMITTER CAN BE LOCKED INSIDE A PARKED VEHICLE, WHY DO THEY SAY \"IF THE REMOTE TRANSMITTER IS INSIDE THE VEHICLE, THE DOORS WILL NOT LOCK.\" IN THE OWNER'S GUIDE? I WOULD THINK THAT EITHER THEY PUT A WRONG STATEMENT IN THE OWNER GUIDE OR THEY DON'T WANT TO ADMIT THE DEFECTIVE LOCKING SYSTEM. ...UPDATED 07/30/15 *BF    UPDATED 10/23/2017*CN",
