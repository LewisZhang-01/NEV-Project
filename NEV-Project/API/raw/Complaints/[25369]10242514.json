        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING ON I-10 AT NIGHT AT APPROXIMATELY 75MPH WITH MY FAMILY, WE EXPERIENCE COMPLETE FAILURE OF THE VEHICLE'S ELECTRONICS SUCH AS LOSS OF BRAKING, STEERING, ODOMETER, SPEEDOMETER, ALL INSTRUMENTS, AND TRANSMISSION.  WE HAD A TOTAL LOSS OF EVERY ELECTRICAL FUNCTION OF THE VEHICLE AT THE MOST DANGEROUS POINT AND TIME OF OUR TRAVEL - AT NIGHT, ON AN INTERSTATE, AND FAR FROM MAJOR CITIES.  AFTER MUCH STRESS AND FEAR, WE LIMPED TO OUR DESTINATION BARELY.  IN SHORT, WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A VOLVO DEALER.  THE DEALERSHIP STATED THAT THE C.E.M. (ONE OF FEW \"BRAINS\" OF THE VEHICLE FAILED) NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, AND OF COURSE WE DID.  I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT C.E.M FAILURES ARE AN COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS TYPE OF VEHICLE.  TWO DEALERSHIPS HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY HAVE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE RECENTLY.  THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE.  OUR LIVES WERE AT RISK GIVEN OUR CIRCUMSTANCE.  I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT OTHERS HAVE EXPERIENCED.   A FIRE, PROPERTY DAMAGE, CRASH, AND REPORT TO POLICE SHOULD NOT IN THIS CASE BE THE GENESIS OF A RECALL.  THE SIMPLE FACTS OF OUR  NEAR GRAVE EXPERIENCE SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO HAVE A RECALL. *TR",
