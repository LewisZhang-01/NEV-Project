THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS NEVER WORK WHEN I NEED THEM TO.  ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE HAD TO PULL OFF THE ROAD WHEN IT RAINS DUE TO NO VISIBILITY.  IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND I DON'T AGREE WITH THE GM INSPECTOR WHO SAID IT WAS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE. IT IS A POTENTIALLY FATAL DEFECT IN THEIR PRODUCT AND I DON'T THINK I SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR FIXING IT.  THERE HAVE BEEN RECALLS FOR EARLIER MODEL VEHICLES, BUT MINE WERE NOT INCLUDED.  SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT THIS.",
