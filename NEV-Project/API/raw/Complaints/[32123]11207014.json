THIS HAPPENS WHEN I COME TO A COMPLETE STOP, WHEN I SLOW DOWN AND PICK UP THE SPEED OR JUST DRIVING NORMAL. THE DEALER SAID IT HAD TO IMITATE THE PROBLEM SO HE CAN KNOW WHAT TO FIX. SO IT DID IMITATE THE JERK SO HE WANTED TO DRIVE IT HISSELF CAUSE HE SAID THE WAY I WAS DRIVING CAUSED THE CAR TO JERK. I TOLD HIM I HAD THIS CAR 2 YEARS AND IT HAS NEVER DONE THAT. SO IT CAN'T BE THE WAY I'M DRIVING. I'VE BEEN DRIVING THE SAME THE WHOLE WHILE I'VE HAD THE VEHICLE. THEY HAVE GAVE THE CAR BACK TO ME AND IT'S DOING THE SAME THING EVEN WORSE. . IT'S FRUSTRATING CAUSE THEY KEEP SAYING THAT IT'S NOT DOING IT. I WILL NEVER BY ANOTHER CAR FROM THIS DEALERSHIP AGAIN. THIS IS THE SECOND VEHICLE THAT I HAVE PURCHASED FROM THEM WITH A BAD ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION. NO HELP FROM THE DEALER JUST A LEMON OF A CAR. THE RADIO KEPT GOING BLANK. THEY SAID THEY FIXED THAT. I GOT IT BACK IT DID IT AGAIN PLUS THE JERKING. I'VE BEEN TO THEM3 TIMESALREADY STILL HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. &#128545;NEVER WILL PURCHASE A DODGE JEEP OF. O KIND AGAIN.",
