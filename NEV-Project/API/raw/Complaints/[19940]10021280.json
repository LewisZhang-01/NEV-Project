VISIBILITY WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. I PROCEEDED IMMEDIATELY TO THE NEAREST DEALER AND WAS INFORMED ABOUT A DEFECTIVE WIPER MOTOR RELAY CIRCUIT BOARD THAT GM HAS REDESIGNED TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM. I PURCHASED THE UPDATED MODULE KIT AND INSTALLED THE UNIT IN LESS ONE HALF HOUR. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM WHICH SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER A RECALL PROGRAM SO AS TO AVOID SERIOUS MISHAPS.  *AK",
