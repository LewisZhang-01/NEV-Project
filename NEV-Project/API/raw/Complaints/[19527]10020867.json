        "summary": "MY COMPLAINT IS ABOUT THE BLEND DO FOR THE HEATING SYSTEM OF THE 2003 MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE.  WHEN THE TEMPERATURE CONTROL KNOB IS ROTATED TO THE HOT POSITION, A CABLE BEHIND THE DASHBOARD AND DIRECTLY OVER THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL ROTATES THE BLEND DOOR LEVER TOWARD THE FIREWALL.  A PIN ON THE LEVER, WHICH CONNECTS TO THE CABLE, ENGAGES MY SHOE, PINNING MY SHOE TO THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL.  TO FREE MY SHOE, I MUST EITHER ROTATE MY HEEL CLOCKWISE TO DISENGAGE THE PIN, OR ROTATE THE TEMPERATURE CONTROL KNOB TO THE COLD POSITION.  I BELIEVE THIS CREATES AN UNSAFE DRIVING CONDITION AND, THE FIRST TIME IT OCCURRED, I TEMPORARILY LOST CONTROL OF THE CAR WHILE ATTEMPTING TO FREE MY FOOT.MANUFACTURER'S RESPONSE  I FIRST REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO MITSUBISHI BY LETTER DATED MARCH 7, 2003. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, I WAS TELEPHONED BY THE DEALER WHO INVITED ME TO BRING THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR A DEMONSTRATION FOR THE FACTORY REP, LARRY WITTREN.  THAT DEMONSTRATION OCCURRED ON APRIL 4, 2003.  THE COMPANY'S RESULTING POSITION WAS AS FOLLOWS:  1.ANY CORRECTIVE ACTION FOR MY VEHICLE WOULD BE AT MY EXPENSE, OR AT THE DEALER\u0019S EXPENSE IF THE DEALER WISHES TO INCUR ANY LIABILITY THAT COULD RESULT FROM MODIFICATION;2.THAT \u001cCOMFORT\u001d ISSUES ARE NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANUFACTURER, EVEN THOUGH I CLEARLY STATED THAT THIS IS NOT A COMFORT ISSUE; RATHER, ONE OF SAFETY;  3.THAT THE MANUFACTURER CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ACCIDENTS AS THE RESULT OF \u001cWEARING A WORK BOOT TO DRIVE THE CAR,\u001d EVEN THOUGH I NEVER CLAIMED THAT THE PROBLEM IS THE RESULT OF WEARING BOOTS, WORK SHOES OR ANY OTHER BULKY FOOTWEAR.  WAS MITSUBISHI SUGGESTING THAT PEOPLE WHO WEAR RIDING BOOTS ON WEEKENDS OR STEEL TOED SHOES TO WORK SHOULD NOT PURCHASE MITSUBISHI PRODUCTS?I BELIEVE THAT MITSUBISHI HAS CREATED A SAFETY HAZARD IN THE DESIGN OF THE BLEND DOOR LEVER.  I FURTHER BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF REDESIGNING THE LEVER WITHOUT A PIN THAT ENGAGES THE DRIVER'S SHOE.  *AK",
