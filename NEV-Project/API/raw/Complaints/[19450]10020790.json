        "summary": "LESS THAN A YEAR AGO, I PURCHASED A 1995 MAZDA 626 LX FROM A FRIEND.  MY FRIEND HAD INFORMED ME THAT THE CAR HAD A NEW TRANSMISSION, ETC.. SO I DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE CAR SINCE IT DID NOT SEEM THAT MUCH ELSE COULD GO WRONG WITH IT BESIDES MAINTENANCE.  SHORTLY AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR, THE O/D OFF LIGHT BEGAN TO FLASH.  NOTHING SEEMED TO BE WRONG WITH THE CAR, THOUGH SO I CONTINUED TO DRIVE IT.  MY FRIEND SAID THAT HE HAD TAKEN IT BACK TO THE PLACE THAT HAD REPAIRED THE TRANSMISSION AND THEY COULD FIND NO REASON WHY THAT LIGHT OCCASSIONALY CAME ON.  THE LAST TIME THE LIGHT CAME ON, THE CAR BEGAN TO SHIFT REPEATEDLY FROM 3RD TO 4TH GEAR AND WOULD REMAIN IN NEITHER GEAR.  IT HAS NOW BEEN A MONTH AND I AM STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE CAR.  EVERYONE I HAVE CONSULTED HAS EITHER REFUSED TO WORK ON THAT CAR OR HAVE RUN ME AROUND TO THE POINT THAT I NOW HAVE A LONG LIST OF POSSIBLE PROBLEMS BUT NO CLEAR ANSWERS.  I BEGAN TO RESEARCH ON MY OWN RECENTLY OVER THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSMISSION OF THIS YEAR AND MAKE OF CAR.  IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT I ISSUE A COMPLAINT AND SO HERE I AM.  THE TRANSMISSION IS LESS THAN TWO YEARS OLD AND YET, SOMETHING HAS GONE WRONG AGAIN.  OF COURSE, THERE IS NO LONGER A WARRANTY ON IT AND I FIND IT RATHER ODD THAT SO MANY MECHANICS, EVEN THE DEALTERSHIP ITSELF, DOES NOT WANT TO HELP OUT WITH THE REPAIRS TO THIS TRANSMISSION.",
