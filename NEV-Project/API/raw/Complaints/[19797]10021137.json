        "summary": "I WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT MAY 28, 2002 IN WHICH BOTH VEHICLES MADE CONTACT AT THEIR LEFT FRONT CORNERS.  TOTAL VEHICLE SPEED WAS AT LEAST 40 MPH AT CONTACT AND MAYBE HIGHER.  THE OTHER VEHICLE'S AIRBAGS BOTH DEPLOYED WHILE NEITHER ONE OF MINE IN A 2002 ENVOY DID.  THIS WAS NOT A DIRECT HEAD ON CRASH, BUT THE ANGLE OF IMPACT WAS SUCH THAT BOTH VEHICLES STOPPED IMMEDIATELY.  THE ONLY MOVEMENT AFTER IMPACT WAS A PIVOTING AROUND WITH THE REAR OF BOTH VEHICLES.  IN OTHER WORDS, WE STOPPED UPON  CONTACT. BOTH VEHICLES WERE A TOTAL LOSS AND THERE WERE INJURIES IN MY VEHICLE. THEY WERE NOT SEVERE, BUT HAPPENED NONETHELESS.  MY 8 YEAR OLD SON HAD SEVERE SEAT AND SHOULDER BELT MARKINGS AS WELL AS BRUISES FROM HIS LEG HITTING A PHONE HOLDER. I RECEIVED SOME NECK INJURIES THAT ARE STILL BEING TREATED AND AT THIS DATE WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG TREATMENT WILL TAKE.  I HAVE PHOTOS  OF BOTH MY VEHICLE AND THE INJURIES TO MY SON.  MY QUESTION AND COMPLAINT INVOLVES THE REASONS THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.  I BELIEVE THAT IN AN IMPACT OF THIS NATURE, THEY SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED. THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS MODEL YEAR FOR AN AIRBAG, AND I RECEIVED A NOTICE IN THE MAIL, BUT WHEN THE DEALER RAN MY VIN MY VEHICLE DID NOT SHOW UP AS NEEDING THE FIX. I DO NOT BELIEVE THE RECALL INVOLVED THE DEPLOYMENT MECHANISM.*AK",
