GM REPLACED THREE UNDER WARRANTY, BUT REFUSES TO REPAIR OR PAY FOR REPAIRS TO THE WINDOWS THAT HAVE FAILED SINCE THE CAR ACCUMULATED OVER THE 36,000 MILE WARRANTY. WE PAID FOR ONE REPAIR OURSELVES BUT REFUSE TO PAY FOR THE TWO REMAINING NON-FUNCTIONING WINDOWS. WE  PURCHASED THE CAR NEW IN DEC OF 1999. THE ONLY RESPONSE THAT WE'VE GOTTEN FROM GM IS THAT WE SHOULD TAKE IT TO A GM DEALERSHIP AND HAVE IT \"DIAGNOSED\" AT OUR EXPENSE. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT TWO OF THE CURRENTLY FAILED WINDOWS ARE ONES THAT THEY'VE ALREADY REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY. THE INCIDENT DATE GIVEN IS FOR THE FIRST FAILURE, THEY'VE BEEN FAILING REGULARLY EVER SINCE. WE BELIEVE THIS  TO BE NOT ONLY A FUNCTIONAL PROBLEM BUT A SAFETY CONCERN AS WHEN THE WINDOWS FAIL THEY STAY IN EITHER THE UP OR DOWN POSITION, WE'VE NOW EXPERIENCED MULTIPLES OF EACH. IN THE DOWN THE POSITION THE CAR IS NOT SECURE AND IN THE UP POSITION A POSSIBLE AVENUE OF ESCAPE FROM THE VEHICLE IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT IS ELIMINATED.   *NLM",
