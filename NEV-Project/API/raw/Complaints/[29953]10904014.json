CONSUMER SEEKS REIMBURSEMENT FOR FRONT COIL SPRINGS RECALL REPAIRS.  *SMD     THE CONSUMER STATED THE COIL SPRINGS WERE ON RECALL, BUT THE PARTS WERE UNAVAILABLE. BOTH OF THE FRONT COIL SPRINGS AND STRUTS BROKE DUE TO CORROSION. THE CONSUMER HAD THE VEHICLE REPAIRED AT A LOCAL REPAIR SHOP. SINCE THE PARTS USED TO REPAIR THE VEHICLE WERE NOT REPLACED WITH NISSAN PARTS, THE RECALL COULD NOT BE CLOSED. THEREFORE, THE CONSUMER COULD NOT BE REIMBURSED. THE MANUFACTURER SUGGESTED HAVING THE PARTS REPLACED WITH NISSAN PARTS. DOING THIS, THE CONSUMER WOULD HAVE TO INCUR THE EXPENSES OF THE STRUTS BEING REPLACED SINCE, THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED IN ORDER TO REPLACE THE SPRINGS.  UPDATED 08/23/2017*JS",
