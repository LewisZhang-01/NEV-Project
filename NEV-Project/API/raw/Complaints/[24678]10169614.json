THERE WAS AN ADVISORY TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE SLOWLY TO THE NEAREST DEALER.  DIAGNOSTIC TESTING WAS PERFORMED AND THEY DETERMINED A CYLINDER WAS LEAKING AND THE HEAD AND VALVE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  12,000 MILES AFTER THE FIRST REPAIR, THE IDENTICAL SCENARIO RECURRED.  WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER, THEY DETERMINED THE DIAGNOSTIC CODE WAS THE SAME AS THE PREVIOUS VISIT.  ANOTHER CYLINDER WAS LEAKING AND IT NEEDED A HEAD AND VALVE JOB AGAIN.  THE SERVICE MANAGER EXPRESSED THE REASON FOR THE RECURRENCE WAS DUE TO THE DESIGN OF THE HEAD WHICH WAS INSTALLED WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS MANUFACTURED AND DURING THE REPLACEMENT.  THE MANUFACTURER WAS CONTACTED, AND DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NOW A NEW PART FOR REPLACEMENT.  THE CONTACT WAS CONCERNED THAT THE ORIGINAL PART AND THE NEW PART HAD THE SAME PART NUMBER. *NM",
