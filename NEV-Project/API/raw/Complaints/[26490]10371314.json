THE DEALER CLAIMED IT WAS TYPICAL AND NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. UPON CHECKING INCIDENT REPORTS I DISCOVERED IT IS CERTAINLY TYPICAL, BUT WHETHER I SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT IT IS UNDETERMINED. TOYOTA KNEW OF THIS PROBLEM AND ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN IN 2008, NEITHER THEY NOR THEIR DEALERS INFORMED THE OWNERS. THE PROBLEM WAS SERIOUS ENOUGH THAT IT WARRANTED A REDESIGN OF THE INTERMEDIATE STEERING SHAFT COMPONENTS TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. I BELIEVE THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECTIFIED THROUGH A RECALL.",
