THE DECELERATION IS SUDDEN, HARSH AND VERY UNSETTLING. ALSO, WHILE DRIVING UP EAST COAST MOUNTAINS, SUCH AS IN  MD. VA. AND PA., THE TRANSMISSION SEEMS TO HAVE A VERY BAD SMELL AS IF HEATING UP TOO MUCH.  EVENTUALLY THE TRANSMISSION FAILED.  IT WAS REPLACED BY DEALER AT NO COST.  NOW THE REPLACEMENT TRANSMISSION IS DOING THE SAME THINGS AGAIN!  IT LOOKS LIKE THE TRANSMISSION IS DUE TO FAIL AGAIN!!   *JB",
