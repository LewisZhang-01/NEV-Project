I HAD THE SERVICE DONE AT 8K TO CORRECT THE FEATHER AT A NISSAN DEALER AND AFTER A MONTH THE FEATHER OCCURS AT 75 MPH SPEED DUE TO SHAKING ON STEERING WHEEL BUT AT LOW SPEED WHEN BRAKING STEERING ALSO TENDS TO SHAKE AND PULLS TO THE RIGHT. WENT TO THE DEALER TO INVESTIGATE IF RECALL HAS BEEN UPDATED OR CORRECTING THE RECALL AND NO REPLY, AT 22K NISSAN DEALER RECOMMENDED TO REPLACE THE FRONT TIRES DUE TO UNEVEN WEAR.   THIS I BELIEVE CAN LEAD TO DRIVING DAMAGE AND INJURES IF TIRE IS PUNCTURE DUE TO TIRE FLARE ACTION FROM THE RIMS TO THE TIRES, THIS WOULD CAUSE THE TIRE TO FLARE OFF THE RIM AND CAUSE THE CAR TO LOOSE CONTROL AND OTHER INJURY TO CARS AND DRIVERS DUE TO TIRE FLARE OFF AND BECOME A PROJECTILE. *AM  *NM",
