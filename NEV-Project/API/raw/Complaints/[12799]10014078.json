THE CAR HAD TO BE TOWED.  I WAS TOLD THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.  I WAS GIVEN THE TORSION BAR AS PROOF TO OFFER FORD THAT IT IS INDEED A DEFECT.  HOWEVER, FORD REALLY DOES NOT WANT TO HEAR THAT. THIS IS MY PROBLEM AND THEY WILL DO NOTHING.  ( I WAS TOLD TO HOLD ON TO MY RECEIPT, JUST IN CASE THERE IS A RECALL) I HAVE FOUND OVER 31 COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND NOTHING IS BEING DONE ABOUT IT.  WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM ADDRESSED?  NO ONE WAS HURT THIS TIME, BUT, WHAT ABOUT THE NEXT.  I CAN'T STAND THE THOUGHT OF PUTTING MY CHILDREN AND MYSELF BACK IN THIS CAR KNOWING THE LEFT ONE COULD BREAK JUST AS EASY AS THE RIGHT ONE DID AND I COULD BE ON THE HIGHWAY THIS TIME.  *JB",
