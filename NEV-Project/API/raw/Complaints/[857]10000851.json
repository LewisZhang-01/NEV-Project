ONE HAS BEEN REPLACED DUE TO FAILURE, ONE IS GOING (I HAD THE SAME SYMPTOMS JUST 2 DAYS AFTER I GOT THE VEHICLE BACK FROM THE DEALER), AND THE REST WILL PROBABLY GO.  THE NEWLY DESIGNED COILS ARE ON BACKORDER FROM VW, CAUSING QUITE A BIT OF INCONVENIENCE.  ALTHOUGH THE DEALER AND VW KNOW THE OLD COILS ARE BAD, THEY WON'T REPLACE THEM WITH THE NEWLY DESIGNED COILS UNTIL THEY GO BAD.  I SMELLED SMOKE THE FIRST TIME MY CAR DIED, AND I'M VERY NERVOUS THAT IT WILL CATCH ON FIRE AS HAS HAPPENED TO OTHER PASSAT OWNERS.  PLEASE, PLEASE LOOK INTO MAKING VW RECALL THE VEHICLES FOR THIS PROBLEM.  THE CAR CAN POSSIBLY STALL WHILE IN MOTION.  IT'S NOT SAFE.",
