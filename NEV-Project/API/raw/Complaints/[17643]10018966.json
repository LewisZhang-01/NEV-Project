        "summary": "I OWN 92 FORD RANGER. LAST THURSDAY,5/15/2003, WHILE DRIVING TO WORK I NOTICED MY PASSENGER SIDE FRONT LOWER THAN THE REST OF THE TRUCK. AFTER I PARKED AT WORK I INVESTIGATED AND NOTICED THAT THE SHOCK/SPRING TOWER WAS RUSTED SO BAD THAT IT WAS ALMOST READY TO FALL OFF. THE SPRING WAS BENT BACKWARDS AND THE SHOCK WAS BROKEN AT THE BOTTOM. AT THE FORD DEALER, THE MECHANIC SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT. HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT THEY ONLY MAKE THAT PART FOR THE RIGHT SIDE? THE LEFT SIDE LOOKS LIKE BRAND NEW. APPARENTLY ONLY THE RIGHT ( PASSENGER ) SIDE RUSTS OUT AND NOT THE LEFT. IT SEEMS THAT METAL IS INFERIOR AND CAN CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. FORD MUST KNOW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY ONLY MAKE THE PART FOR ONE SIDE AND NOT THE OTHER. I CAN'T FIND ANY RECALL INFO ON THIS. BESIDES THE $800.00 COST TO REPAIR, THIS CAN CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  *NLM",
