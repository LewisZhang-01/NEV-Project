THE FRACTURE IS WITHIN THE 1ST COIL FROM BOTTOM, SO NOT NOTICEABLE UNTIL TECHNICIAN CASUALLY NOTICED IT.  THE CRACK IS QUITE RUSTY WHICH WOULD INDICATE THAT IT'S BEEN BROKEN FOR A LONG TIME.  WAS TOLD FORD WOULD REPLACE, BUT UPON CALLING, TOLD THAT FOR ONLY 10 YEARS (NHTSA ID: 01I007000) - EVEN THOUGH IT'S PROBABLY BEEN CRACKED FOR YEARS. FORD DEALER NOW WANTS $385+. IF CRACKS AGAIN, COULD PUNCTURE TIRE & CAUSE SUDDEN ACCIDENT.  AMAZED THAT THIS IS NOT MANDATORY RECALL!!!  *TR",
