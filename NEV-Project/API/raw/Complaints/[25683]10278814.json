THE GEAR SHIFT INDICATOR WAS FLASHING \"PRND.\" I HAD TO PUSH THE CAR OFF THE HIGHWAY, I WAITED 10 MINUTES, RE-STARTED THE CAR AND DROVE IT TO THE CLOSEST VW DEALER. THEY SAID IT WAS A FAULTY TEMPERATURE SENSOR, AND THAT NONE WERE AVAILABLE IN NORTH AMERICA. I WAS TOLD TO CONTINUE DRIVING THE VEHICLE AND JUST TO PULL OVER EVERY TIME THE CAR BEHAVED LIKE THIS. *TR",
