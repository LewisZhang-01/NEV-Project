FORTUNATELY I HAD A CHAIN AND LOCK ON IT TO PREVENT THEFT AND IT ALSO PREVENTED DAMAGE TO MY TRUCK AND THE CAR FOLLOWING ME. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST PROBLEM AND YOUR LAST INVESTIGATION WAS CLOSED IN 1999 WITH NO RECALL. I HAVE SEEN THIS PROBLEM NUMEROUS TIMES. DOES SOMEBODY HAVE TO BE KILLED BEFORE GM RECALLS THIS PROBLEM OR WILL THEY CONTINUE MAKING MONEY SELLING THE REPLACEMENT PART FOR ALMOST $70 AND NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR POOR DESIGN?*JB",
