UPON BRINGING IT TO THE DEALER I WAS INFORMED THAT THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE AND THAT IT IS ACCEPTABLE AND NORMAL.  NOTHING WAS WORKED ON OR FIXED.  THE CAR IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY AND HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER OWNING IT.  THIS INFORMATION WAS NOT MADE APPARANT TO US BEFORE PURCHASING THIS VEHICLE.
