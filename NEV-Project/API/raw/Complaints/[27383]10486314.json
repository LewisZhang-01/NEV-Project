AFTER BRAKES FAILED AND FLUID LEAKED OUT OF REAR BRAKE LINES NEITHER THE ABS OR \"BRAKE\" WARNING LIGHTS WERE INDICATED ON THE DASH CONTROL PANEL. I AM CONCERNED THAT A BRAKE LINE FAILED AND NO INDICATION OF FAILURE SHOWED ON THE CONTROL PANEL. WITH THE FAILURE NOT UNDER ANY STOPPING FUNCTION (VEHICLE WAS ALREADY STOPPED) AND THERE WAS NO REPORT OF FAILURE WITH THE CONTROL PANEL THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY ISSUE IF BRAKES FAIL WHILE DRIVING AND FIRST NOTICE IS COMPLETE LOSS OF PEDAL WILL CAUSE ACCIDENT OR AT LEAST LOSS OF CONFIDENCE AND OR CONTROL OF VEHICLE. I AM THE ORIGINAL OWNER OF THIS VEHICLE AND HAVE ALL RECORDS OF REPAIR OVER THE HISTORY OF THE TRUCK. I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT A BRAKE LINE FAILURE TOOK PLACE AT ALL. I HAVE OWNED DOZENS OF VEHICLES OVER MY DRIVING LIFE AND HAVE HAD VEHICLES WITH WELL OVER 200,000 MILES WITH NO BRAKE LINE FAILURES. IF THIS IS NOT A DEFECT IN DESIGN OR WORKMANSHIP, THEN THE DEFECT HAS TO BE IN INFERIOR MATERIAL QUALITY THAT SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED IN THIS IMPORTANT FUNCTION REQUIRED FOR OPERATING A VEHICLE.   *TR",
