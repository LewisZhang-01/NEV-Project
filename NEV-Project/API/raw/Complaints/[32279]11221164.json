WHILE GOING UPHILL RECENTLY THE VEHICLE SPUTTERED TO CLIMB UPHILL. LUCKILY THE VEHICLE HAS NOT COMPLETELY STALLED OUT YET. THIS MOSTLY HAPPENS ON CITY STREET HOWEVER WHEN GETTING ONTO THE ON RAMP IT SPUTTERS TO ACCELERATE SOMETIMES AND ALSO IF TRAFFIC COMES TO A STOP ON THE HIGHWAY AND I TRY TO ACCELERATE AGAIN. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS CAUSING THIS. I HAVE COMPLETED REGULAR MAINTENANCE ON THE CAR SO THIS HAS COME OUT OF NOWHERE. I SEE PREVIOUSLY THERE WAS A RECALL FOR A LOSS OF OIL PRESSURE WHICH COULD CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO STALL BUT I'M NOT SURE IF MY VEHICLE WENT THROUGH THIS RECALL.",
