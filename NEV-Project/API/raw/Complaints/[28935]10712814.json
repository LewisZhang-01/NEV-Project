NOW AT LOW SPEEDS 2-5MPH IN AN INTERSECTION OR FROM A STOP SIGN, OR SLOW DOWN ON RAILROAD TRACKS THE CAR WILL NOT MOVE EVEN WITH THE GAS PEDAL TO THE FLOOR, UP TO A 5 SECOND DELAY. WE WERE IN AN INTERSECTION, THE LIGHT CHANGED AND CARS WERE ONCOMING, AFTER HITTING THE GAS PEDAL THE CAR JUST SAT THERE, THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES AND WE WERE ALMOST HIT. TOOK IT BACK AND IT WAS REPROGRAMMED. STILL HAS THE SAME DELAY, TAKING IT BACK FOR THE 3RD TIME. IF YOU DO A ROLLING STOP AND START OUT INTO THE INTERSECTION THE CAR REFUSES TO MOVE, THE ENGINE IS RUNNING, BUT NO RESPONSE FROM THE JEEP. WE ARE AFRAID WE WILL GET STUCK IN AN INTERSECTION OR RAILROAD TRACK AND GET KILLED! THE JEEP ONLY HAS 4000 MILES ON IT. IF YOUR JEEP IS RUNNING FINE...DO NOT LET THEM REPROGRAM THE TRANSMISSION!!!  *TR",
