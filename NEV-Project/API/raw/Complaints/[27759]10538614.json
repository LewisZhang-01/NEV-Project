THE CLUTCH PEDAL BRACKET CRACKED AND POPPED OFF DUE TO POOR QUALITY AND BAD ENGINEERING, IN MY OPINION. THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED THE TRANSMISSION TO LOCK UP AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT THROUGH LOSS OF CONTROL. I WAS NOT ABUSING THE VEHICLE/ HAVE NOT ABUSED THE VEHICLE.. THIS ITEM SHOULD NOT BREAK IN THE MANNER IT DID. *JB",
