APPROXIMATELY A CUP OR MORE COMES OUT OF THE JEEP'S TANK. I THINK THIS IS A POTENTIAL FIRE HAZARD AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY THE NHTSA AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BEFORE SOMEONE IS HURT BY THIS DEFECT.  A RECALL FOR THE ITEM SHOULD BE MANDATED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND JEEP SHOULD BE FORCED TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.  I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET AND IT SEEMS PRETTY WIDESPREAD.  *TR",
