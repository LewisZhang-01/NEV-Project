I COULD NOT TURN THE ENGINE OVER WITH THE STARTER OR ANY OTHER MEANS. IT WAS TOWED INTO THE KIA DEALER AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD THE ENGINE IS SEIZED UP AND HAS TO BE REPLACED. THE DEALER HAS TOLD ME THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH SOME OF THESE 2013 MODEL YEARS. KIA HAS SAID THIS PARTICULAR CAR IS NOT ON THEIR RECALL LIST. IF YOU LOOK ONLINE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM OF CARS WITH A RECALL IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED HERE. I BELIVE THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM WITH THIS PARTICULAR ENGINE AND KIA IS NOT STANDING BEHIND IT.",
