        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING MY 2000 LINCOLN LS THE TRANSMISSION TENDS TO SHIFT ON IT'S OWN FROM HIGH TO TO LOW GEAR AND BACK TO HIGH GEAR THUS CAUSING A STALL. THIS SITUATION CAN HAPPEN AT ANY TIME, IE: WHILE DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE AT 65 MPH IT WELL SHIFT BACK AND FORTH AND CAUSE THE VEHICLE TO HESITATE AND THEN STALL. WHEN THERE IS A TRACTOR TRAIL RIG BEHIND YOU AT 65 OR 70 MPH YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN. BEING A TRAINED VEHICLE OPERATOR TO DRIVE UNDER VERY ADVERS CONDICTIONS I CAN HANDLE THE SITUATION, ON  MOST TIMES, BUT THERE ARE SITUATIONS THAT EVEN THE BEST DRIVERS CAN NOT HANDLE. THE DEALERSHIP KEEPS TELLING ME THAT IT IS AN AIR FLOW PROBLEM TO WITH THE SENSOR BUT I SAY IT IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AND THE DEALER SHOULD REPORT IT TO THIER HEADQUARTERS AND REPAIR THE PROBLEM FOR FREE.*AK",
