TECH RIGHT AWAY SAID IT THE RADIATOR FAN SECONDARY BUSHING IS GONE BAD AND NEED TO REPLACE THE COMPLETE FAN ASSEMBLY WITH SHROUD, WHICH COSTS $950 (550 FOR PARTS AND 400 FOR LABOR). I WAS TOLD VEHICLE IS STILL DRIVABLE AND ITS SECONDARY FAN THAT GOES BAD WHICH WON'T KICK IN UNTILL VEHICLE GETS REALLY HOT (SUMMER).  FOUND IT ONLINE THAT THESE FANS GO BAD QUICKLY ON PATHFINDERS AND IS A KNOWN ISSUE. I AM WONDERING WHY THERE ARE NO RECALLS OF THESE FANS AS THEY FAIL SO PREMATURELY, SOME TIMES THEY HAVE TO BE REPLACED 2 TIMES WITHIN 50K  MILES.",
