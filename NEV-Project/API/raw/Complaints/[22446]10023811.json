WHEN I REMOVED THE RADIO FROM THE CAR I FOUND A SSCP03 TAG DATED 07/13/94 WITH DEALER CODE NO \"78\" STAMPED ON IT.  SSCP03 IS THE TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (TSB) NUMBER I FOUND FOR A \"SAFETY RECALL\" .TODAY I WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP, AT WHICH I HAD PURCHASED THE CAR, TO INVESTIGATE THIS.  THE DEALERSHIP REPRESENTATIVE PRESENTED ME WITH A PAGE OF A \"WARRANTY DOFU/SSC REPORT\" ITEMIZING A     \"P03   1991 CAMRY/PREVIA RADIO    08/24/94   31027\"    FOR MY VEHICLE.  IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THIS SHOWED THAT THE RADIO    [TOYOTA 86120-03042...CE-2233TL1B SERIAL NO. R7002084]    WAS FACTORY REPAIRED ON 07/13/94 AND INSTALLED IN THE VEHICLE ON 08/29/94, SATISFYING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SAFETY RECALL.  I AM CONCERNED THAT: THIS RADIO CEASED TO FUNCTION SUDDENLY; THE SSCP03 IDENTIFICATION APPEARS ON IT; AND, THOSE DATES PRECEED THE ISSUE DATE \"SEP 94\" OF THE SAFETY RECALL IDENTIFIED BY ALLDATA.COM. *AK",
