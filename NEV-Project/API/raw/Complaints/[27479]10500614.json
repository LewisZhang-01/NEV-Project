I WAS LUCKY TO NOT BE HIT. I SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES AND THREW IT INTO PARK. I TURNED MY CAR OFF AND RESTARTED IT AND TRIED TO MOVE IT AND I HAD NO DRIVE SO I TRIED TO PUT IT IN REVERSE TO BACK IT UP ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND NOTHING I HAD NO DRIVE NO REVERSE NOTHING!!!!! I HAD IT TOWED TO THE SHOP AND I STILL KNOW NOTHING ON WHY IT HAPPENED EXCEPT THEY SAID THERE IS AN INTERNAL TRANSMISSION ISSUE. I HAVEN'T EVEN OWNED IT A YEAR. I RELY ON THIS CAR TO SAFELY GET MY THREE KIDS WHERE THEY NEED TO BE AND NOW I'M TERRIFIED TO PUT MY CHILDREN BACK IN THIS CAR AFTER READING ALL THE OTHER HORROR STORIES ABOUT THIS CAR. THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL!!!!!!!!!!   *TR",
