I PURCHASED MY CAR NEW CAR AND RECENTLY BROUGHT MY CAR INTO THE DEALER FOR A DOOR-LOCK ACTUATOR RECALL AT DAVID MCDAVID HONDA IN TEXAS AND I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT I HAVE A LEAK IN MY RACK AND PINION THAT CANNOT BE FIXED. I HAVE TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE POWER STEERING/ RACK AND PINION SYSTEM WITH AN ALIGNMENT FOR ABOUT A COST OF $1500. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM/DEFECT WITH THE 2008 CR-V AND HONDA SHOULD RECALL THE MODEL. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE DUE TO A FIRE HAZARD. MY CAR MILEAGE IS ONLY 11, 637. IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE FOR IT TO HAVE A POWER STEERING PROBLEM AT THIS TIME.  *TR",
