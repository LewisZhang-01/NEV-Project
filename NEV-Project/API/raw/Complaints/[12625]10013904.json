THE RIM'S ON THE CAR ARE SO FLIMSY THAT I HAVE HAD TO RIMS BENT IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS.  THEY CAN NOT HANDLE NON PAVED ROADS.    TH FRONT SEAT BELT DOES NOT RETRACT PROPERLY CAUSING THE SEAL ON THE DOOR TO BE TORN WHEN THE DOOR IS SHUT.    THE GAS MILEAGE IS TERRIBLE.  SUPPOSED TO BE UPWARDS OF 35+ MPG ON THE HIGHWAY AND I ONLY GET APPROXIMATELY 24 - 26 MPG.    THE INSURANCE ON THIS VEHICLE IS RIDICULOUS!!  YOU THINK THAT I HAD AN AUDI.  THE COST OF THE INSURANCE IS THE SAME.      I HAVE BROUGHT UP MY CONCERNS WITH THE DEALER THAT I PURCHASED THE CAR FROM AND THEY DON'T SEEM TO THINK THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE HOWLING SINCE THEY COULDN'T GET IT TO DO IT WHILE THEY WERE DRIVING THE CAR.    THE GAS MILEAGE THEY SAID WOULD IMPROVE WHEN THE ENGINE WAS BROKE IN AT ABOUT 20,000 MILES.  WELL I AM PAST THE 20,000 AND THE MILEAGE HAS NOT IMPROVED.    I AM NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THIS CAR.  I WOULD GET RID OF IT IN A MINUTE IF I COULD GET OUT FROM UNDER THE PAYMENTS.",
