IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION SINCE WE TRAVELED WITH TWO YOUNG CHILDREN ON A 2-WAY ROAD WITHOUT SHOULDER THAT NIGHT.  WE NOTICED THAT A COMMON PROBLEM EXISTED ON BOTH NISSAN QUEST AND MERCURY VILLAGER (1993-1995) DUE TO NUMEROUS SIMILAR COMPLAINS ON INTERNET.  WE BELIEVE IT IS A DEFECT CAUSED BY IMPROPER DESIGN BY MANUFACTURE.  SINCE IT IS A POTENTIAL LIFE-THREATEN DEFECT, THE AUTO MAKER SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CORRECTING THE PROBLEM.",
