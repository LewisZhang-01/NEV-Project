ON WAY HOME FROM WORK THE FOLLOWING DAY ON I75 DRIVING 70MPH WHICH IS THE SPEED LIMIT, THE CAR STARTED MAKING A LOUD CLUNKING SOUND AND WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO STEER.  NEARLY HAD ACCIDENT WHILE TRYING TO GET TO SHOULDER OF ROAD.  WAS INFORMED BY MECHANIC THAT \"THE REAR END WENT OUT OF YOUR CAR BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY DIFFERENTIAL FLUID LEFT IN IT\" WHEN I ASKED HOW THAT COULD HAPPEN THE MECHANIC SAID THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A LEAK OF SOME KIND. STARTED RESEARCHING AND FOUND THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE CAR 4 YEARS BEFORE I PURCHASED IT.  WHEN I CALLED GM AT 800-458-8006 I WAS TOLD BY AUTOMATED PHONE SYSTEM THERE IS AN OPEN RECALL ON MY VEHICLE #07204E AND 10355C SO ASKED TO SPEAK WITH A REPRESENTATIVE AND THE LADY FROM MANILLA IN THE PHILIPPINES (BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEIR CUSTOMER CARE CENTER IS???) INFORMED ME THAT THERE IS \"NO OPEN RECALL ON YOUR CAR\" EVEN AFTER I TRIED TO EXPLAIN THE AUTOMATED SERVICE HAD JUST GIVEN ME 2 OPEN RECALL NUMBERS FOR MY VIN # ...SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T HELP ME FIND SERVICE FOR MY CAR.",
