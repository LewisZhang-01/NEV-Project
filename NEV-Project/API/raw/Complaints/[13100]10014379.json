IT SOUNDED LIKE DRIVING ON THE GROOVES USED TO WARN DRIVERS THEY ARE GOING OFF THE ROAD.  THEN THE REAR OF THE TRUCK BEGAN TO MOVE SLIGHTLY LEFT/RIGHT.  WE WERE JUST STARTING UP A LONG, STEEP HILL IN THE SLOW LANE AND WERE ABLE TO PULL OVER ONTO THE SHOULDER IN A GOOD SPOT WHERE PEOPLE COULD SEE US.  MANY DRIVERS CAME CLOSE, BUT WE WERE NOT INJURED.  A TRUCKER STOPPED TO HELP US.  HE SAID IT LOOKED LIKE THE TIRE HAD DRY ROT.  MAYBE A FOOT OF TREAD NEAR THE SIDE WALL CAME LOOSE.  A SMALL CHUNK [3''] WAS ALSO LOOSE.  THE TIRE COLLAPSED COMPLETELY.  I FEEL WE MIGHT HAVE LOST CONTROL IF WE HAD BEEN PASSING OR GOING DOWN HILL.  I CHECKED INFLATION JUST A FEW DAYS EARLIER.  *NLM",
