        "summary": "TRANSMISSION NOISE/IDLE PROBLEM. I HAVE TWO MAJOR COMPLAINTS ABOUT MY CAVALIER    FIRST: THE 5SP MANUAL TRANSMISSION. I'VE COMPLAINED ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION 5 TIMES, AND THE IDEL 4 TIMES. WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR IT HAD A HIGH PITCHED NOISE IN 1ST AND 2ND GEAR.   I TOOK THE CAR BACK THE FIRST WEEKEND I OWNED IT TO HAVE IT CHECKED. DEALER COULDN'T DIAGNOSE. I TOOK THE CAR BACK A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER. THEY HEARD THE NOISE AND SAID IT WAS THE EXHAUST. THEY PUT A NEW EXHAUST SYSTEM ON IT. NEEDLESS TO SAY IT DID NOT FIX IT. I TOOK THE CAR BACK AGAIN A FEW MONTHS LATER, THEY SAID IT WAS SYNCHRONIZERS. TSB 02-07-29-001 SERVICED. AGAIN, THE CAR WAS NOT FIXED. BUT THIS TIME CHEVY TOLD ME IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. (WHY ON EARTH WOULD THEY REPLACE PARTS, AND DO THE TSB IF IT WAS SUPPOSED TO DO THAT) THEY TOLD ME I COULD GET A SECOND OPINION, BUT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE SERVICING DEALERSHIP OUT OF POCKET.    SECOND: I'VE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS 4 TIMES. WHEN DRIVING IN BUMPER TO BUMPER TRAFFIC. I HAVE TO SLIGHTLY REV THE GAS TO LET THE CLUTCH OUT TO MAKE THE CAR MOVE. THE IDLE WILL STICK. I'VE HAD IT STICK ANYWHERE FROM 2500RPM - 4000RPM. (THE LINKAGE/PEDEL DOSEN'T STICK BUT SOMETHING WITHIN THE COMPUTER, OR FI IS NOT RIGHT. DEALERS DIAGNOSIS \"COMPUTER CONTROLS THE IDLE\" \"NO CODES\" \"NO PROBLEM\". NOTHING FURTHER WAS DONE. THIS PROBLEM HAS CAUSED ME TO ALMOST REAR END OTHER CARS ON MULTIPLE OCCASSIONS    NOW OTHER THAN THESE PROBLEMS I'VE ALSO HAD TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE STARTER. IT WORKS 99% OF THE TIME CORRECTLY. OTHER TIMES IT GRINDS, SOMETIMES DISENGAGES, TURNS OFF, AND SOUNDS LIKE A DEAD BATTERY. THE DEALER ALSO CAN'T FIND THIS PROBLEM EITHER.",
