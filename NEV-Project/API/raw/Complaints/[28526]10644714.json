        "summary": "ON THE WAY HOME GOING ALONG THE INTERSTATE AT THE SPEED LIMIT OF 70 MPH, THE STEERING SUDDENLY CUT OUT WITHOUT WARNING. WE SAFELY MADE IT TO THE SIDE OF THE INTERSTATE IN WHICH A LIGHT POPPED UP IN MY DASH WHICH SAID STEERING LOSS STOP SAFELY. I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND THEN STARTED IT BACK AGAIN IN HOPES THAT IT WAS JUST A GLITCH, BUT THE ERROR WAS STILL THERE. BY THE GRACE OF GOD, WE MADE IT HOME SAFELY. THE FOLLOWING MORNING, I CALLED THE CORPORATE CUSTOMER RELATIONS NUMBER AT THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SPOKE TO A CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE WHO TOLD ME THAT YES THERE ARE RECALLS ON FOCUSES OF THE SAME YEAR FOR STEERING LOSS, BUT MY VIN NUMBER DID NOT FALL UNDER THAT RECALL BECAUSE MY CAR WAS NOT MADE AT THE SAME MANUFACTURING LOCATION.  HE BASICALLY ADVISED ME THAT I NEED TO CALL MY LOCAL FORD DEALER AND HAVE MY CAR SENT THERE FOR REPAIR. I THEN RECEIVED THE ACTION PLAN FROM THE SUPERVISOR AT FORD  IN WHICH IT DISCUSSED THE RESULTS FROM THE DIAGNOSTIC TEST. ALL THE RESULTS CORRELATED WITH THE OTHER FOCUS RECALLS WHICH SPOKE OF HIGH STEERING RESISTANCE AND THE TOTAL ESTIMATED BILL OF $2,207.55. I THEN CALLED THE CUSTOMER RELATIONS BACK AT CORPORATE FORD MOTOR COMPANY, GAVE THEM MY CASE NUMBER, AND EXPRESSED THE ISSUE THAT I WAS HAVING, THE DIAGNOSIS OF THE CAR, THE CORRELATION BETWEEN MY CARS DIAGNOSIS AND THE RECALLED FORD FOCUS DIAGNOSIS; THE REPRESENTATIVE THAT I SPOKE TO THEN SAID SHE WOULD DRAFT UP SOME MORE PAPERWORK IN MY CASE AND SEND IT TO HER SUPERVISOR, BUT IT WASN'T LIKELY THAT MY CAR WOULD BE COVERED UNDER RECALL. THE INCIDENT ON THE INTERSTATE WAS ONE THAT WAS HORRIFYING, COULD HAVE CAUSED DEATH AND HAS SENT ME INTO A SPIRAL OF NON-STOP PANIC ATTACKS AND I AM UNSURE OF WHAT ALL I CAN DO. I NEED YOUR HELP TO STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING TO SOMEONE ELSE AND TO HELP US GET THE RECALL FOR SAFETY CONCERNS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AFFORDED IN THE FIRST PLACE.  UPDATED 10/27/14. *JB",
