        "summary": "1999 FORD EXPLORER - AIRBAG SENSOR STAYS ON; WILL NOT DEPLOY AIRBAGS.  FORD DEALERSHIP SAYS IT NEEDS A \"CLOCK SPRING\" A COIL OF WIRE LIKE A STATOR WHICH BURNED AND CAUSED A SHORT IN THE AIRBAG WIRING.  ACCORDING TO FORD, THIS WILL ALSO CAUSE THE HORN AND CRUISE CONTROL TO MALFUNCTION.  FORD WANTS $300 TO REPLACE THE CLOCK SPRING.  MY CONTENTION IS THAT THIS IS A SAFETY DEVICE IN WHICH THERE ARE NO WEARABLE PARTS.  IT IS A MIS-ENGINEERED COMPONENT THAT SHOULD REQUIRE A RECALL TO FIX.  THIS COULD VERY WELL CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY TO SOMEONE BY NOT DEPLOYING THE AIRBAG IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT.  THERE ARE 30/40 COMPLAINTS JUST IN THIS WEB SITE ALONE FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.  WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO ESCALATE THIS PROBLEM AND HAVE FORD PRODUCE A RECALL TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE?  FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS....",
