        "summary": "ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS DURING PAST 3 YEARS, I EXPERIENCED A SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER STEERING, WHICH COULD BE REINSTATED BY PULLING OVER, SHUTTING OFF ENGINE AND RESTARTING CAR.  A FEW WEEKS AGO, IT COULD NOT BE REINSTATED AND I HAVE HAD A PERMANENTLY LOSS OF STEERING.  THE ISOLATED INCIDENTS OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING, SOMETIMES IN A PARKING LOT WHERE I CAME CLOSE TO HITTING CARS BECAUSE I COULD BARELY MUSTER THE PHYSICAL STRENGTH NECESSARY TO STEER IN TIGHT SPOTS, OTHER TIMES WHILE DRIVING IN CITY STREETS.  THEY APPEARED TO OCCUR RANDOMLY ABOUT ONCE OVER FEW MONTHS UNTIL IT FINALLY HAPPENED PERMANENTLY.  SO FAR, I HAVE NOT HAD ANY ACCIDENTS OR INJURIES, ALTHOUGH I CANNOT LET MY WIFE DRIVE THE CAR BECAUSE SHE LACKS THE PHYSICAL STRENGTH TO OVERCOME THE LOSS OF POWER STEERING.  THE CAR IS NOW WITH THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT IT AND THEY ARE CHARGING ME APPROXIMATELY $1,900 TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE STEERING ASSEMBLY.  THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION GIVEN BELOW IS FOR THE LAST, PERMANENT OCCURRENCE.  *TR",
