I MADE IT OFF THE ROAD SAFELY, BUT IT MADE ME REALIZE HOW DANGEROUS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR THIS TO OCCUR ON THE INTERSTATE.  THE FIRST TIME IT FAILED, THE DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION WITH A NEW ONE.  FRIDAY, JUNE 20, 2003 MY TRANSMISSION FAILED THE SECOND TIME.  THIS TIME THE DEALER SAID THAT ACURA DOES NOT HAVE ANY MORE NEW TRANSMISSIONS AND THEY WANT TO GIVE ME A REMANUFACTURED ONE.  I FIND THIS VERY DISCOMFORTING THAT ACURA/HONDA WANTS TO GIVE ME A PREVIOUSLY FAILED TRANSMISSION.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ACURA WOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH NEW TRANSMISSIONS FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS.  I DON'T FEEL I SHOULD SUBJECT MY FAMILY TO FURTHER DANGER.  I FEEL I HAVE THE RIGHT TO A NEW PART AS THE CAR IS WITHIN THE WARRANTY PERIOD.   *NLM",
