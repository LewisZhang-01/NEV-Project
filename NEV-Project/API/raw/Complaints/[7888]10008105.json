I STOPPED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED AND SAW THE LENS WAS NOT ATTACHED TO THE ASM.  IN CHECKING THE OTHER HEADLIGHT I FOUND IT TO WAS READY TO COME OFF.  THE OTHER HEAD LIGHT WAS VERY LOOSE.  THE DEALER HAD STATED THIS WAS A PROBLEM ON 1998 CADILLACS BUT STATE IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRENTY. CALLED THE 800 # AND WAS TOLD THE SAME THING.  IN CHECKING I FOUND MANY COMPLAINTS AND ONE STATED THE POSITION CADILLAC IS TAKING IS THAT THE LENS IS A TRIM ITEM. IF THIS WAS FACT THEN THE LENS SHOULD BE SOLD AS A SEPERATE TRIM ITEM. THE FACT IS IT CAN NOT AND IS SOLD AS A ASSEMBLY WHICH COST $245 EACH.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFRY HAZARD FOR THE DRIVER AND ANYONE WHO COULD BE HIT BY THE LENS.  I FEEL THIS SCAM SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED AND WOULD LIKE AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THIS WAS NOT A RECALL ITEM WITH SO MANY SAFTEY COMPAINTS.  I ALSO FOUND THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE 1998 -1999.  *JB",
