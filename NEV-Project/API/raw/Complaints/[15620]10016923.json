THIS MOTORCYCLE WAS PURCHASED IN 8/1998 AND THE FIRST INCIDENT OCCURRED IN 10/1998 WITH THE RIGHT SIDE MIRROR.  THE SECOND INCIDENT OCCURRED IN 4/2000 WITH THE LEFT SIDE MIRROR.  THE THIRD INCIDENT OCCURRED IN 9/2001 WITH THE RIGHT SIDE MIRROR AGAIN.  AND THE MOST RECENT INCIDENT TOOK PLACE ON 4/27/2003 WITH THE LEFT SIDE MIRROR AGAIN.  EACH TIME THIS OCCURRED, THE OWNER REPLACED THE MIRRORS WITH THE SAME STYLE GENUINE HARLEY DAVIDSON FACTORY MIRRORS.  THE MATERIAL THAT THE FACTORY MIRRORS ARE BUILT FROM CANNOT WITHSTAND THE VIBRATION OF THE MOTORCYCLE AND CONTINUE TO SHEAR OFF.  THE MOTORCYCLE ONLY HAS 14K MILES ON IT AND SHOULD NOT HAVE EXPERIENCED SO MANY FAILURES IN THE MIRRORS DURING THIS TIME.           *TT",
