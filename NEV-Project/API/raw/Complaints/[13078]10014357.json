IF I STOPPED AND LET THE CAR SIT FOR A FEW MINUTES, IT WOULD BE OK FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN IT WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN.  THIS CONTINUED AFTER I HAD THE FUEL FILTER REPLACED, AND A MECHANIC COULDN'T FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM.  IT HAS HAPPENED AT MANY SPEEDS, BUT MOST OFTEN WHILE ON THE FREEWAY. TODAY, AT 49,000 MILES, I HAVE MORE THAN HALF A TANK OF GAS, GOING ABOUT 35 MPH, AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED.  *NLM",
