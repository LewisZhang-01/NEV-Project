FIRST THE ABS MOTOR CONTINUES TO RUN AFTER THE ENGINE HAS BEEN SHUT OFF, I HAD TO DISCONNECT THE ABS FUSE SO THE BATTERY WILL NOT GET DRAINED. SECOND THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION IS SHIFTING HARD FROM 1ST TO 2ND AND FROM 2ND TO 3RD, I AM FORCED TO SHUT THE ENGINE OFF FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES AND WHEN I RESTART THE ENGINE THE PROBLEM DISAPPEAR, I HAVE READ YOUR SAFETY BULLETINS AND GM IS AWARE OF THESE PROBLEMS.  MY TRUCK LOOKS AND ACTS PRACTICALLY LIKE NEW EXCEPT FOR THE INTERMITTENT TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS AND THE ABS.  I HAD BABIED MY TRUCK SINCE I BOUGHT IT, AND I HAVE OWNED GM PRODUCTS ALL MY LIFE AND I DON'T THINK IS FAIR FOR ME TO SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR GM'S MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS... PLEASE ADVICE... THANKS...!!!*JB",
