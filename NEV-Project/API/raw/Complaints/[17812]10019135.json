I WAS TOLD MY BRAKES ARE THE WAY THEY ARE BECAUSE OF THE DRIVING CONDITIONS AND BECAUSE I LIVE IN AN AREA WHERE THERE ARE HILLS.  I WAS READY TO BREAK THE DEALERS KNEE CAPS.  WHO DOES HE THINK I AM.  STUPID.  THE GUY WHO PUT THE BRAKES ON MY CAR TOLD ME THEY MADE THEM TO SMALL FOR THESE CARS ANYWAYS.  SO WHO DO I BELIEVE.  SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE GM IS RIPPING PEOPLE OFF LEFT AND RIGHT.  IT S NOT RIGHT.  FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE GOTTEN NEW ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS AT LEAST THREE TIMES.  GOT SENT ON MY WAY ONCE AND GOT ROTORS TURNED ONCE.  WHAT ELSE DOES GM NEED.  WHY ARE THEY STALLING.  GOT MY AIR CONDITIONER FIXED ON MAY 13, 2003 FOR LIKE I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES NOW I HAVE LOST COUNT.  ANYWAYS IT IS NOW MAY 22,2003 AND IT DOESN'T WORK.  NOW I NEED TO GO BACK TO THE DEALER AGAIN.   I THINK ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WORK AT GM NEED TO DRIVE NOTHING BUT ALL OF OUR CARS THAT HAVE THESE BRAKE PROBLEMS AND SEE HOW THEY LIKE IT.   PAYING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR A HUNK OF JUNK.  BEWARE DON'T BUY THIS CAR AGAIN AND SOMEONE GET THERE FINGER OUT OF THERE YOU KNOW WHAT.  *NLM",
