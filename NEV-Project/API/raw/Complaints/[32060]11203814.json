AFTER FEW MONTHS, 650 MILES OF USAGE, A WARNING LIGHT FOR FOR THE ENGINE AND \"DRIVING MODE UNAVAILABLE\" STARTED POPPING UP, SO THIS A PLATE LIGHT WARNING POP UP AS WELL. BROUGHT TO FIAT, THEY SAID IT WAS THE THERMOSTAT WHICH IT WAS THEN CHANGED AND SUPPOSEDLY WOULD FIX THE ISSUE. GOT THE CAR BACK. AFTER FEW DAYS AND 125 MILES MORE AGAIN THE \"DRIVE MODE UNAVAILABLE\" WARNING POP UP... THEN THE FOUR WHEAL DRIVE UNAVAILABLE POP UP..THERE WAS ALSO A WHEAL WARNING POPPING UP. THEN OUT OF A SUDDEN, ON A TRAFFIC LIGHT THE CAR DIDN'T WANT TO START. I HAD TO TURN OFF THE ENGINE AND TURN BACK ON. ONCE I TURNED THE ENGINE BACK, ALL KINDS OF WARNING SIGNS CAME UP. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE HOME. THEN THE ENGINE LIGHT WARNING KEPT ON. SO DID THE \"DRIVE MODE UNAVAILABLE\". BROUGHT THE CAR BACK TO FIAT RIGHT AWAY. THEY SAID THE BATTERY WAS NOT TIED CORRECTLY. WHICH I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT DID HAPPEN AND WHY THEY DID NOT SEE THAT THE FIRST TIME THEY LOOK AT THE CAR. GOING TO PICK UP THE CAR TOMORROW AND HOPE WILL NOT GOING TO HAVE TO REPORT FURTHER ISSUES.",
