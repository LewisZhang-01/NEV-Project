OVER TIME THE SYMPTOMS BECAME MORE FREQUENCY AND THE ENGINE WOULD ALSO SWITCH OFF. THIS FAILURE CAUSED THE VEHICLE'S ACCESSORIES INCLUDING POWER STEERING TO STOP FUNCTIONING AND ALMOST RESULTED IN AN ACCIDENT.  I LATER LEARNED THAT THE PROBLEM IS CAUSED BY A FAULTY IGNITION SWITCH WHICH THOUGH KNOWN TO AFFECT MANY HONDA ACCORDS DOES NOT COVER THE 1994 MODEL YEAR. REPLACEMENT OF THE IGNITION SWITCH, AT MY EXPENSE, HAS REMEDIED THE PROBLEM.   *NLM",
