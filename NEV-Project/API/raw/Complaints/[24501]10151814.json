IT IS MADE OF PLASTIC INCLUDING THE HOOKS ON THE BACK SO EVERYTIME THE SEAT BELT TAPS ON IT JUST RIGHT IT SNAPS THE PLASTIC BRACKETS ON THE BACK AND OFF IT FALLS.  I HAVE ALSO HAD TO REPLACE THE STEREO AND AM ABOUT TO DO IT AGAIN.  IT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS TRYING TO FEED THE CD.  WHEN YOU SHUT THE FRONT PASSENGER DOOR, IT STOPS.  *NM",
