        "summary": "I OWN A 2009 MAZDA CX 7 TURBO. THE VEHICLE HAS HAD IT'S PROPER OIL CHANGES BY A SERVICE GARAGE NOT A \"QUICK LUBE\" PLACE. THE OIL WAS CASTROL GTX 5W-30W, WITH FROM OIL FILTER.THE LONGEST INTERVAL BETWEEN OIL CHANGES WAS 6000 MILES   AND THE SHORTEST 4000 MILES. THE VEHICLE NOW HAS 45,664 MILES ON IT AND THE WIFE COMPLAINED ABOUT A HIGH PITCHED NOISE  AND LACK OF PERFORMANCE . BROUGHT   TO THE MAZDA DEALER, THE DEALER SAID THE TURBO WENT AND THAT MAZDA WILL NOT COVER IT UNDER WARRANTY (60,000 WARRANTY ON DRIVE TRAIN AND TURBO) BECAUSE OF ENGINE SLUDGE !! ARE YOU KIDDING ME...ENGINE SLUDGE, THE PROPER OIL VISCOSITY WAS USED AT  PROPER INTERVAL (MAZDA SAYS 7500 BETWEEN OIL CHANGES). NO SIGNS OF OVER HEATING, HIGH ENGINE TEMPS, THE VEHICLE IS DRIVEN TO WORK AND BACK (4 MILES AWAY) 2X'S PER DAY 6 DAYS A WEEK. SOUNDS TO ME LIKE ENGINE OIL IS NOT GETTING UP TO TEMP. AND THIS IS CAUSING THE SLUDGE, MAZDA DOES NOT STATE THIS ANYWHERE ANY TIME IN THEIR MANUAL. I FOUND THIS OUT ONLY AFTER RESEARCHING ON LINE....ANYONE ELSE HAVING ISSUES WITH THEIR MAZDA ???? I'VE OWNED TURBOS BEFORE AND NEVER HAD ISSUES. MY VEHICLE GETS IT'S OIL CHANGE BY THE SAME STATION AND THIS NISSAN HAS 190,000 MILES ON IT WITH NO PROBLEMS AND NO SLUDGE !!!  *TR",
