THIS SAME ENGINE, IN THE 1995 WINDSTAR(EVEN THOUGH FORD SAID THAT THEY CORRECTED THE PROBLEM) WAS RECALLED FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.  I CAN SEE THAT IF THIS WERE A RARE CASE OF GASKET FAILURE, IT WOULD NOT MATTER VERY MUCH, BUT SEEING THAT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM BOTHERS ME.  FORD SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE AND FIX THIS PROBLEM.  I DO NOT KNOW HOW A RECALL GETS STARTED, BUT WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS ONE DONE.                                  THANK YOU",
