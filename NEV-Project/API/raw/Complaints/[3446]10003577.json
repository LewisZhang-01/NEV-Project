WHEN A COILPACK DIES, IT CAUSES THE CAR TO NOT REALLY RUN, ON 2-3 CYCLINDERS VS 4. . THUS LEAVING YOU STRANDED. I USED TO WORK TILL MID-NIGHT AND DRIVE 50+ MILES EACH WAY TO WORK. DUE TO COIL-PACK FAILURES I HAVE BEEN LEFT STRANDED TWICE AFTER MIDNIGHT. THIS IS VERY FUSTRATING. YOU NEVER KNOW IF YOU CAR WILL MAKE IT HOME. NOTHING LIKE BUYING A BRAND NEW CAR, AND HAVING MORE PORBLEMS THAN MY USED PREVIOUS CAR.",
