        "summary": "I HEARD NOISE FROM THE FRONT LEFT WHEEL. JACKED UP THE TRUCK AND FOUND THE ENTIRE WHEEL LOOSE. TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE DEALERSHIP, THEY TORQUED THE HUB NUT AND SAID IT WAS FINE TO DRIVE. TOOK THE TRUCK ON A TRIP AND HAD CONSTANT PROBLEMS AND NOISE FROM THAT SIDE OF VEHICLE. RETURNED THE TRUCK TO THE DEALER AND WAS TOLD IT NEEDED A NEW HUB BUT WAS OK TO DRIVE. DROVE TO A CONFERENCE 200MILES AWAY AND BROKE DOWN. TOWED THE TRUCK TO A DIFFERENT DEALER AND WAS TOLD THAT BOTH HUBS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE TRUCK HAS 75K MILES ON IT. I WAS TOLD BY SERVICE ADVISORS AT BOTH DEALERSHIPS THAT THEY HAD SEEN THIS PROBLEM SEVERAL TIMES ON THIS MODEL TRUCK. I ASKED IF GM WAS LOOKING AT A POSSIBLE RECALL AND GOT A NEGATIVE. I CALLED GM CUSTOMER SERVICE AND FILED A COMPLAINT (CASE# 1-60491961) AND WAS POLITELY TOLD THAT SINCE I WASN'T THE ORIGINAL OWNER AND THE TRUCK WAS OUT OF WARRANTY \"TUFF BEANS.\" I TOLD THE REP I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY GM WOULD WANT TO WAIT FOR AN ACCIDENT WITH INJURIES TO LOOK INTO THIS TYPE OF A PROBLEM. NO RESPONSE. IF THE LOOSE, OR IMPROPERLY TORQUED, HUB NUT CAUSED THE HUB TO FAIL, SEEMS LIKE THIS SHOULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE FOR GM TO CONSIDER. TS",
