CAR WAS TOWED TO DEALERSHIP; PARTS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER WEEK--EVEN THEN ONLY ONE OF FOUR WILL BE REPLACED. TALKED TO VW CUSTOMER RELATIONS==INDICATED MANUFACTURER IN GERMANY IS NOW ON 3 SHIFT BASIS STRUGGLING TO MEET DEMAND. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY OWNERS WERE NOT NOTIFIED, WHY THIS IS NOT A SAFETY RECALL, WHY WE DON'T KNOW WHEN OR IF ALL COILS WILL BE REPLACED. I WOULD NOT TRUST THIS CAR ON THE ROAD.",
