I NOW HAVE WATER IN THE SAME LIGHT ASSEMBLY AS WELL AS THE LEFT FRONT HEAD LIGHT WHICH HAS BLOWN DUE TO THE WATER IN THE LIGHT ASSEMBLY. AFTER SEEING THIS SAME PROBLEM IN OTHER GENERAL MOTORS VEHICLES USING THE SAME LIGHT ASSEMBLIES I SPOKE WITH TWO DIFFERENT SERVICE MANAGERS AT DIFFERENT GM DEALERS. BOTH SUGGESTED DRILLING HOLES IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LIGHT ASSEMBLIES SO THE WATER CAN DRAIN OUT. THIS SEEMS TO BE A TEMPORARY FIX TO A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. I ALSO EMAILED PONTIAC ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. *JB",
