HE DID MANAGE TO GET THE VAN HOME BEFORE ANY ACCIDENT OCCURRED, HOWEVER WHEN HE WAS IN THE DRIVEWAY THE ENGINE REVVED UP TO AS FAR AS IT WOULD GO WITHOUT ANYONE TOUCHING ANYTHING.  IT WAS TAKEN TO NISSAN GARAGE AND FOUND THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL CABLE HAD SNAPPED AND REQUIRED REPLACEMENT.  IF THIS HAD HAPPENED WHILE HE WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY I HATE TO THINK OF WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.       *TT",
