I WAS DRIVING HOME ONE NIGHT AND THE TRUCK STALLED OUT, LUCKILY THERE WAS A PLACE TO PULL OVER ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  AFTER I GOT TOWED AND SPOKE TO NISSAN THEY WERE READY WITH THE ANSWER - IT'S THE FUEL SENDING UNIT!  A BUILD UP OF CORROSION IN THE WIRE OF THE SENDING HAD SHORTED OUT THE SIGNAL TO SUPPLY GAS.  NICE JOB NISSAN!  PIECE OF CRAP! RECALL!!!!!!!!!!!",
