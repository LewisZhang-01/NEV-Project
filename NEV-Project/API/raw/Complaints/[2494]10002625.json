ON 12-1-02, WITH 7,504 MILES ON THE VEHICLE, THE #2 COIL BROKE AND I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO GEZON MOTORS IN GRAND RAPIDS, MI. I WAS VISITING MI, SO I HAD TO BORROW A CAR TO RETURN HOME TO OHIO. THEN, ON JAN. 12, 2003, COILS #3 AND #4 BROKE SO I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO MIDWESTERN AUTO GROUP IN DUBLIN, OHIO. THERE WERE APPROX. 8500 MILES ON MY CAR AT THAT TIME. BECAUSE THE COILS ARE ON BACKORDER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE CAR WILL NOT BE REPAIRED FOR TWO WEEKS. CONSIDERING THE NUMBER OF VW DRIVERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING DEFECTIVE COILS, THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THIS PART. IN ADDITION TO THIS PROBLEM, MY RADIO SUDDENLY STOPPED WORKING AND HAD TO BE REPLACED IN NOVEMBER 2002.",
