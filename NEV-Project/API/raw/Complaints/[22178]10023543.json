WHEN I WENT TO LEAVE, CREEPING FROM A DEAD START, MY BRAKES FAILED...OR MY TIRES DIDN'T GRIP THE ASPHALT.  I DON'T KNOW WHICH.  I JAMMED MY FOOT ON THE BRAKES AND NOTHING HAPPENED.  I WENT SKIDDING DOWN THE INCLINE.  WHEN I REACHED THE BOTTOM, MY CAR FINALLY STOPPED.  FORTUNATELY THERE WAS NO CROSS TRAFFIC, SO I AVOIDED A COLLISION.  I HAVE PHOTOS OF THE EXTENSIVE SKID MARKS LEFT BY MY CAR.   *NLM",
