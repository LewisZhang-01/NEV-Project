IT HAS BEEN NOTED TO ME THAT THIS IS A \"QUIRK\" OF THE STEERNG FOR THIS MODEL AND CAN NOT BE REMEDIED. THE CAR WAS BOUGHT USED AND TOLD THAT THE RACK AND PINION STEERING HAD BEEN REPLACED BUT DID NOT REMEDY THE SITUATION AND WAS NOT A SAFETY CONSIDERATION. IN MY OPINION, WHEN SOMETHING MAKES A SNAPPING SOUND AND CAN BE FELT, THIS IS SURELY A SAFETY FACTOR. CAN YOU ADVISE IF THIS IS A SAFETY FACTOR OR NOT? I'M NOT REALLY COMFORTABE DRIVING THIS CAR.  *TR",
