THERE IS NO SAFETY DEVICE ON THESE BOLTS TO PREVENT THEM FROM JUST SLIPPING OUT AND CAUSING THE ENGINE TO FAIL.  THIS INCIDENT, IF OCCURING IN A BUSY STREET OR FREEWAY COULD ENDANGER OTHER MOTORIST AS WELL AS THE OCCUPANTS OF THE DISABLED VEHICLE.  AFTER RESEARCHING THIS TYPE OF INCIDENT, I HAVE FOUND THAT THIS HAS BECOME A COMMON PROBLEM WITH BMW'S AND THAT BMW IS AWARE OF THIS YET THEY REFUSE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM.  *JB",
