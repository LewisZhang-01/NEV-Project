I SHOULD NOT BE MADE TO PAY FOR IT AGAIN. THE FIRST CHARGE WAS $1032 AND I AM AGAIN BEING CHARGED $1306. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY AGAIN FOR THE SAME PROBLEM. I HAVE EXCEED THE LIMITED WARRANTY OF ONE YEAR OR 12,000 MILES. THE LOWER INTAKE IS DESIGNED TO LAST ALMOST THE LIFE OF THE CAR. THE CAR IS A 99 PONT GRAND AM. I PURCHASED IT IN JUNE 2000. I HAD THE CAR 2 YEARS AND 8 MONTHS AND I AM STILL MAKING PAYMENTS ON IT. THIS IS UNFAIR THAT I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR REPAIRS AGAIN. ALSO I UNDERSTAND THAT RECALLS WERE DONE FOR THE STEERING AND BODY STRUCTURE. I NEVER GOT ANY NOTICES ABOUT ANY RECALLS. IF I HAD NOT GONE TO YOUR WEB SITE, I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN.  HOW DO I GET MY CAR REPAIRED WITHOUT CHARGE? ALSO THE ALTERNATOR WAS REPLACED 07/02/2002 FOR $456 AND THE ALTERNATOR HAD TO BE REPLACED AGAIN 03/17/03 WHICH I WAS NOT CHARGED FOR.  I PURCHASED A CAR WITH A LOT OF DEFECTS AND SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY. I WILL GET RID OF THIS CAR. *JB",
