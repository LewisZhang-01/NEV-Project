THERE IS NO REASONING TO IT. I CAN MOST OF THE TIME GET THEM TO COME BACK ON BY SWITCHING THE SWITCH OFF AND THEN BACK ON AGAIN. THIS HAS BEEN OCCURRING FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS AND SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING MORE FREQUENTLY. DEALER ONCE QUOTED ME CLOSE $800 FOR REPLACING THE BULBS BUT DECLINED SINCE IT WAS SO EXPENSIVE AND I FOUND OUT FROM OTHER PEOPLE THAT HAD THE WORK DONE THAN IT DID NOT REALLY FIX THE PROBLEM. *TR",
