IF THE OBSTRUCTED BAR IS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BASE FROM WHERE THE SEAT IS PUT IN TO THE VEHICLE, THIS OPBSTRUCTION IS NOT EASILY SEEN, AND THE SEAT IS NOT FULLY LOCKED IN TO THE BASE.  E.G. THE SEAT IS INSTALLED IN THE RIGHT OUTBOARD SEATING POSITION, SO THE SEAT IS PLACED IN TO THE BASE FROM THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE.  IF THE STRAP THAT ATTACHES THE LATCH BELT TO THE BASE OF THE SEAT OBSTRUCTS THE LOCKING BAR ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THE CAR SEAT, THE PARENT WOULD NOT NORMALLY SEE THAT AS THE SEAT IS BEING PLACED IN THE VEHICLE.  THEREFORE, ONLY ONE SIDE IS LOCKED IN TO THE BASE.  AS A PARENT THIS HAS HEPPENED SEVERAL TIMES OF THE LAST FIVE MONTHS.  AS A CPS INSTRUCTOR, I KNOW THAT I SHOULD CHECK TO MAKE SURE MY SEAT IS LOCKED IN, BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT MOST PARENTS DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY SHOULD TUG ON THE SEAT TO MAKE SURE IT IS LOCKED IN TO THE BASE",
