I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD THE HEAD GASKET WAS LEAKING AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  I HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY WHICH COVERED MOST OF THE COST, BUT I STILL NEEDED TO PAY FOR PARTS THAT WEREN'T COVERED.  WHEN ASKED HOW THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED WITH A CAR HAVING SUCH LOW MILEAGE, THEY HAD NO ANSWER, JUST THAT IT HAPPENS.  I HAD MY CAR SERVICED AT THE DEALERSHIP IN NOVEMBER OF 2002 FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND FLUID CHECK AND ALSO, UPON THEIR RECOMMENDATION, HAD MY TRANSMISSION FLUID CHANGED.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE HAVE BEEN ANY OTHER COMPLAINTS OF HEAD GASKETS LEAKING IN THIS MODEL AND IF SOMEONE CAN PLEASE TELL MY WHY THIS WOULD HAPPEN.  *NLM",
