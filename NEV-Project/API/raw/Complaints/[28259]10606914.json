        "summary": "I HAD MY 2011 MALIBU SERVICED AT MARTY FELDMAN CHEVROLET FOR ROTORS, BRAKE PADS AND ALL FLUIDS CHANGED BECAUSE OF MILEAGE IN JULY 2013.IN NOVEMBER 2013, I BEGAN HEARING THE SAME NOISES THAT LEAD ME TO HAVE MY ROTORS REPLACED ON THE DRIVER'S FRONT SIDE. I WENT TO SERRA CHEVROLET WHO STATED I NEED ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS. I EXPLAINED I HAD JUST HAD THAT WORK DONE. AFTER PROVING WITH MY PAPERWORK THAT I HAD THE WORK DONE, SERRA CHEVROLET STATED THEY COULD REPLACE THE ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS BECAUSE THE PARTS WERE STILL UNDER WARRANTY. MARTY FELDMAN CHEVROLET SALES MANAGER STATED I COULD BRING IT BACK THERE; HOWEVER, DUE TO CONVENIENCE I ALLOWED SERRA CHEVROLET COMPLETE THE REPAIR WORK. A WEEK LATER MY ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON. I TOOK THE CAR BACK SEVEN TIMES BEFORE THEY WERE ABLE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. IN THE MEANTIME; IN FEBRUARY THE NOISE FROM THE ROTORS RETURNED. BECAUSE I HAD TO DRIVE OVER 40+ MILES BACK AND FORTH (SEVEN TIMES) TO HAVE THE ENGINE LIGHT REPAIRED; I WAS TOLD MY ROTORS WERE NOT UNDER WARRANTY. AFTER CONTACTING GM CONSUMER COMPLAINT AND NOT SETTLING FOR A NO ANSWER; SERRA CHEVROLET STATED THEY GAVE ME NEW ROTORS AND BRAKE PADS. HOWEVER, IN APRIL, THE NOISE RETURNED AND NO-ONE IS WILLING TO ADDRESS MY PROBLEM OR CONCERN. I HAD MY ATTORNEY PREPARE AN OFFICIAL LETTER TO SEND TO SERRA AND MARTY FELDMAN CHEVROLET. NO COMMENTS AS OF YET. I AM PURSUING OTHER MEANS TO GET THE PROBLEM BEFORE THE PUBLIC AND TO GM HEADQUARTERS. I PAY MY CAR NOTE EACH MONTH AND I HAVE HAD CAR PROBLEMS SINCE JULY 2013.  *TR",
