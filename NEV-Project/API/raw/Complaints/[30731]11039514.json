I WAS NOT NOTIFIED VIA MAIL FOR THE SOLUTION OR EVEN AN UPDATE OF THE RECALL WHICH AS THE OWNER AND PRIMARY DRIVER OF THIS VEHICLE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. LUCKILY I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED AN ACCIDENT WHERE THE TAKATA AIRBAGS NEED TO BE ACTIVE. I WILL NOT TAKE THE VEHICLE TO A MERCEDES DEALER BECAUSE THEY NORMALLY DO NOT PROVIDE A SOLUTION BESIDES GIVING ME ALTERNATIVES AND SELLING OTHER SERVICE ITEMS INSTEAD OUTSIDE OF ANYTHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE RECALLS.  I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE YOUR ASSISTANCE IN THIS MATTER...",
