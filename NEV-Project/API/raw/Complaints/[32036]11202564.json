THE FREQUENCY WOULD CHANGE WHEN THE FAN SPEED CHANGED. THE ISSUE GOT WORSE WHEN MAKING LEFT TURNS. ONCE THE CAR WARMED UP, THE NOISE WOULD GO AWAY. TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP MULTIPLE TIMES WITH AUDIO AND VIDEO OF THE PROBLEM AND THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE ISSUE AND TOLD ME THEY COULD NOT REPLACE THE PART UNTIL THEY WERE ABLE TO DUPLICATE IT THEMSELVES. I WAS CONTACTED BY MANAGEMENT AND THE DEALERSHIP FINALLY REPLACED THE BLOWER MOTOR ONCE I REDUCED MY RATING FOR THEM ON GOOGLE REVIEWS. THE MANAGER STATED THAT THE BLOWER MOTOR THEY INSTALLED WAS AN UPDATED PART. THE REPAIRS WERE PERFORMED AT APPROXIMATELY 35,900 MILES.",
