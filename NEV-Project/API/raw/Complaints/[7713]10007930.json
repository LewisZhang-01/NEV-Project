THE NEXT WINTER HOWEVER, THE 4X4 DID NOT WORK.  THANKFULLY THE CAR WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY AND IT WAS FIXED UNDER THE WARRANTY.  SINCE THAT TIME, I HAVE HAD TO HAVE NO BEARINGS PUT INTO THE BRAKES, NEW ROTATORS AND BRAKE PADS TWICE.  IN DEC., 2002, I HAD $500.00 WORTH OF WORK DONE TO REPLACE THE WATER PUMP, THE TIMING BELT AND OTHER BELTS THAT WERE SQUEAKING.  JUST TODAY (AFTER JUST ONE MONTH AGO HAVING $500.00 WORTH OF WORK DONE TO THE CAR), MY CAR IS NOW GETTING HOT WHEN IT SITS AND IDLES.  MIND YOU, I HAVE HAD THIS VEHICLE FOR 4-1/2 YEARS AND THE CAR ONLY HAS 60,000 MILES ON IT.  THIS CAR HAS BEEN A HEADACHE FROM DAY ONE AND BECAUSE THE CAR HAS LOST SO MUCH VALUE I CANNOT EVEN TRADE IT OFF, BECAUSE I OWE MORE ON THE CAR THAN WHAT IT IS WORTH (LIKE $7,000.00 IN THE HOLE).",
