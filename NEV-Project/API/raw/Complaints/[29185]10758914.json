BOTH TIMES I HAVE BROUGHT THE CAR IN FOR AN OIL CHANGE WITH 20% OIL LIFE SHOWING.     SHIFTING FROM 2ND TO 3RD SOMETIMES GETS \"BLOCKED\". THAT IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN DESCRIBE IT, YOU GO TO SHIFT AND CANT GET INTO GEAR, EITHER HAVE TO GO BACK TO 2ND OR BACK TO NEUTRAL AND THEN BACK IN. THE \"DOUBLE PUMP SHIFT\" USUALLY WORKS.    I HAVE ALSO HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE SPEAKER DECK RATTLING WHICH I HAD SUPPOSEDLY FIXED UNDER WARRANTY BUT ONLY TO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM.",
