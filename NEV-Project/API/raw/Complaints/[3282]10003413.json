WAS TRAVELLING ALONG A FLAT ROAD AT ABOUT 40 MPH WHEN IT STALLED.  TOOK NEARLY 10 MINUTES FOR IT TO START AGAIN.  I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER THE FIRST TIME IT STALLED AND THEY REPLACED THE THROTTLE BODY AND A FEW SENSORS RELATED TO AIR INTAKE.  I WILL BE TAKING IT IN AGAIN ON MONDAY FOR THIS STALL.  I HAVE NOT SEEN A SOLID FIX FOR THIS YET AND CANNOT BELIEVE HOW SLOW THE NHTSA IS TAKING TO INVESTIGATE THIS DANGEROUS PROBLEM!  IT IS STRIKE TWO ON FORD MOTOR COMPANY ONE MORE AND I AM TAKING THEM TO COURT!",
