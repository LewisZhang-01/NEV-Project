        "summary": "FRONT PASSANGER DOOR LOCK WILL BRIEFLY UNLOCK THEN ON ITS OWN LOCK ITSELF.  YOU HAVE TO FORCE THE DOOR LOCK OPEN JUST TO GET OUT AND ONCE THE LOCK OPENS IT SLOWLY LOCKS ITSELF.  THE KEY FOB AND LOCK SWITCH WILL BRIEFLY UNLOCK THE LATCH.  (WE DO HAVE FACTORY INSTALLED ALARM).  MY WIFE ALSO NOTICED DOME LIGHT NO LONGER COMING ON (MIGHT JUST BE DEAD BULB).    THIS COULD BE A HUGE ISSUE IN AN ACCIDENT IF PASSENGER OR EMERGENCY PERSONAL ARE UNABLE TO OPEN DOOR DUE TO LOCK ALWAYS LOCKING ITSELF.      A LOT OF FORCE IS NEEDED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR.  IT SEEMS LIKE THE DOOR ACTUATOR IS GETTING A LOCK SIGNAL AND STAYING IN THE LOCKED POSITION.  AGAIN YOU CAN MOMENTARILY MANUALLY FORCE THE DOOR LOCK OPEN AND WITH THE SWITCH/KEYFOB.        RECENT REPAIRS:  WE DID RECENTLY REPLACE THE CAR BATTERY BECAUSE THE CAR LOST ELECTRICAL POWER (CAR WOULD NOT START).  WE ALSO JUST REPLACED THE AC/HEATER BLOWER MOTOR BECAUSE WHEN THE HVAC WAS POWERED ON WE HEARD VERY LOUD WHIRLING/CLICKING NOISE.  WE ALSO JUST CHANGED ALL FOUR STRUTS BECAUSE THEY WERE LEAKING BUT NO ELECTRICAL WAS TOUCHED DURING THIS REPAIR.   *TR",
