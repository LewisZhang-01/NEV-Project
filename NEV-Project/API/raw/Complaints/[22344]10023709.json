        "summary": "I HAVE HAD MY C230 COUPE IN THE SHOP AT ED POTTER MERCEDES COLUMBUS, OH SEVERAL TIMES.  FOUR WEEKS AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR THE WHEELS WERE SO OUT OF ALIGNMENT THAT THE CARS JUMPED LANES, REPEATEDLY I WAS ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THE TERRIBLE 'PULL' EVEN WITH MR. POTTER IN THE CAR - NEVER COULD THEY FIX IT.  THE FUEL TANK WAS REPLACED TWICE, THE STRUT WAS REPLACED, I HAD TO BUY NEW TIRES ($1,277) AFTER 20K MILES, RIGHT NOW IT'S IN THE SHOP, THE SEAL AROUND THE ROOF HAS TO BE REPLACED, THE FRONT SWAY BARS WERE REPLACED, THE RUBBER BUSHINGS ARE BEING REPLACED BECAUSE THE CAR SQUEAKS EE-EE-EE-EE AS I ROLL OVER SOFT WAVES IN THE ROAD.  TODAY THEY CALLED, THEY NEED TO KEEP THE CAR LONGER TO REPLACE THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL SOMETHING ANOTHER - THE SERVICE MANAGER CALLED ME AND EARLIER THIS WEEK AND TOLD ME TO FILL OUT MY SURVEY FROM THE LAST SERVICE \"ALL EXCELLENT\" NOT EVEN REALIZING I NEEDED TO BRING THE CAR BACK IN THIS WEEK FOR MORE PART REPLACEMENT.  ONCE I WAS IN TRAVELING IN LEXINGTON, KY ON MY WAY TO A DERBY PARTY IN LOUISVILLE ON SATURDAY AND THE LOCAL MERCEDES REP SAID TO GET A HOTEL ROOM IN LEXINGTON AND WAIT TILL MONDAY TO HAVE THE CAR FIXED.  THE DAY I BOUGHT THE CAR I HAD A $31,000 VOUCHER FROM MY CREDIT UNION AND THE DEALERSHIP DIDN'T TRUST IT (I LIVE 3/4 A MILE A WAY) AND THEY MADE ME WAIT THREE DAYS UNTIL THE CHECK CLEARED BEFORE THEY DELIVERED THE CAR.  I OWN A 1975 MB 450 SL THAT IS MORE RELIABLE THAN THIS HUNK OF JUNK. PLEASE DON'T BUY A MERCEDES AND IF YOU DID, PLEASE TAKE IT BACK, THEY AREN'T SAFE AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS OUTRAGEOUS.  *JB",
