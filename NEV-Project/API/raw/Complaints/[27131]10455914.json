WE STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS IN MARCH 2012 AND HAD OUR MECHANIC LOOK AT IT, BUT HE COULDN'T GET THE PROBLEM TO DUPLICATE, SO HE CLEANED THE KEY LOCK AND LUBED IT. THE CAR IS PERMANENTLY LOCKED. WE DON'T HAVE A KEY LACENTRY ON THIS VEHICLE, IT IS A MANUAL LOCK. WE NOW HAVE TO INCUR A LOCK SMITH AND/OR TOWING BILL + A REPAIR BILL FOR THE MECHANIC TO FIX WHAT HE BELIEVES IS A FAILURE/BREAKDOWN OF THE LATCH SYSTEM. WE HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY, BUT WE'RE NOT SURE IF THE WARRANTY COVERS THIS PART; EVEN IF THEY DO WE STILL HAVE A $100 DEDUCTIBLE.       *JS",
