I HAVE DETECTED THIS SAME PROBLEM ON MY 2000 CHEVROLET BLAZER PURCHASED IN JANUARY 2000 AT A DEALERSHIP IN SEATTLE WASHINGTON.  THE THROTTLE PEDAL STICKS ON TAKEOFF/STARTUP FROM A STOPPED POSITION (I.E. STOP LIGHT/SIGN).  I HAVE TO EXERT EXTRA PRESSURE ON THE PEDAL TO GET THE VEHICLE MOVING.  WHEN I EXERT THE EXTRA PRESSURE ON THE PEDAL, AFTER ABOUT 1 - 2 INCHES, IT BREAKS FREE AND LUNGES FROM THE STOP.  IT ALSO SOMETIMES HAPPENS WHEN I TRY TO ACCELERATE ON THE FREEWAY, NOT FROM A STOPPED POSITION.  MY WIFE HAS ALSO EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM.  WE JUST GOT HOME FROM A TRIP THROUGH CALIFORNIA FROM 8 DAYS OF DRIVING AND HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM THE WHOLE TIME.  I FIRST EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM ABOUT  A MONTH AGO AND THOUGHT I MIGHT NEED TO USE WD-40 IN THE LINKAGE FROM THE PEDAL.  THIS DID NOT HELP.  I CONTACTED A LOCAL DEALER IN LAS VEGAS WHO SAID THEY HAVE NOT HAD THIS PROBLEM ON ANY OTHER VEHICLE.  I CONSIDER THIS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS NOT NORMAL TO HAVE THE PEDAL STICK LIKE THIS AND IT COULD CREATE AN ACCIDENT POTENTIAL IF IT WERE TO STICK AND THEN LUNGE AND THE NEED TO IMMEDIATELY APPLY THE BRAKES PRESENTED ITSELF.   *NLM",
