AS PER VOLKSWAGON, THE BELT IS NOT DUE TO BE CHANGED UNTIL 105,000 MILES. IT RUINED THE TOP END OF MY ENGINE, COST TO REPAIR IS 3,000-4,000 DOLLARS. VOLKSWAGAN WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY OF THE COST, I FIND THIS TO BE UNFAIR THAT I SHOULD GET ONLY 6 MONTHS USE OUT OF A CAR THAT I STILL OWE 17,000 DOLLARS ON.",
