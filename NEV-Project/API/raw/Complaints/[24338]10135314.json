THE PAPER WORK, INCLUDING THE TITLE, INFORMATION INSPECTION PACKAGE, AND THE GVWR ON THE TRAILER TONGUE STATED THE TRAILER WAS RATED FOR 2990 GROSS VEHICLE WEIGHT RATING.  TRAILER WAS PURCHASED WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WOULD GROSS THIS MUCH WEIGHT.  AFTER PURCHASING THE TRAILER, I VIEWED THEIR WEB PAGE AND FOUND THAT THEY LISTED IT ON THEIR WEB PAGE FOR ONLY 1500 GVWR.  AFTER CONSULTING WITH DOOLITTLE TRAILERS ABOUT THEIR ERROR ON THEIR WEB PAGE, THEY INFORMED ME THAT I COULD ONLY LOAD THE TRAILER TO THE 1500 GVWR.  I EXPRESSED CONCERN TO DOOLITTLE THAT THEIR TRAILER WAS MISREPRESENTED ON SEVERAL LEVELS.  DOOLITTLE HAD REFUSED TO CORRECT THE TRAILER.  *JB",
