AT APPROXIMATELY. 43,000 MILES ( A MONTH AGO) IT BLEW THE HEAD GASKET. I AM AWARE THAT FORD EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON 1994-1996 MODELS OF THE FORD TAURUS AND MERCURY SABLE FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM.  MY FORD DEALER STATED TO US THAT THIS HEAD GASKET BLOWING HAS BEEN A CONSISTENT PROBLEM ON THE 3.8 ENGINES, WHICH OURS HAS.  IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT FORD IS VERY AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND CHOSE TO DO NOTHING ABOUT IT FOR OWNERS OF 1993 CARS.  I FEEL IS WAS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP THESE CUSTOMERS FINANCIALLY--WE JUST SPENT $1700 FOR THIS REPAIR. NEEDLESS TO SAY, IT WAS MONEY WE DIDN'T HAVE. WHY HASN'T THIS PROBLEM BEEN ADDRESSED WITH THE 1993 MODELS WITH THE 3.8 ENGINE BEFORE THIS?  FORD SUGGESTED THAT I ADDRESS THIS WITH YOUR AGENCY. *JB",
