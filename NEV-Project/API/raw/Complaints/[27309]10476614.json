        "summary": "THE PROBLEM BEGAN WITH THE TRANSMISSION LOCKING UP OR SHUDDERING GOING DOWN HILL, THROWING THE VEHICLE AND ME FORWARD.  EVER BEEN ON A GOLF CART GOING DOWN A HILL WHERE THE GOVERNOR THROWS YOU FORWARD?  MULTIPLY THAT BY ABOUT 5 AND THAT'S WHAT YOU GET.   IT HAS PROGRESSIVELY GOTTEN WORSE, TO THE POINT WHERE IT ACTUALLY CAUSES THE WHEELS TO STOP AND \"CHIRP\" ON THE PAVEMENT.  NOW, IT EVEN HAPPENS ON RELATIVELY FLAT AREAS AND, GOING UP SOME HILLS,  THE TRANSMISSION JUST ABOUT GIVES OUT.  IT'S A SAFETY ISSUE FOR SEVERAL REASONS: (1) LOCKING UP GOING DOWN A HILL IS UNSAFE IF SOMEONE IS BEHIND YOU, (2) THE SEVERITY OF IT COULD CAUSE YOU TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE CAR, (3) LOSING POWER GOING UP A HILL COULD CAUSE YOU TO BE REAR-ENDED.   NISSAN HAS BEEN SLOW TO RESPOND EVEN THOUGH OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  MY DEALER SAYS THAT THEY SEARCHED NISSAN'S \"TECH TALK\" ACROSS DEALERS AND FOUND NOTHING.  DO A GOOGLE SEARCH ON \"NISSAN DECELERATION SHUDDER OR LOCKUP\" AND YOU'LL FIND LOTS OF FOLKS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  VERY UNFORTUNATE FOR AN OTHERWISE GREAT CAR.  THEY NEED TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM AND RECALL SOME OR ALL OF THE 2013S.  *TR",
