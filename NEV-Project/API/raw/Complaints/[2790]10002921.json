IT HAS STALLED MANY TIMES AT HIGHWAY SPEED LEAVING ME STRANDED IN THE FAST LANE AND IN HARMS WAY.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN PARK AND TURN THE IGNITION OFF AND WAIT, GENERALLY 5 TO 10 MINUTES, BUT THERE HAS BEEN INCIDENTS WHERE I HAD TO WAIT HOURS BEFORE IT WILL START. THIS IS A VERY RANDOM CONDITION. SOMETIMES IT WILL GO A MONTH WITH OUT A PROBLEM AND OTHER TIMES IT WILL OCCUR 6 OR 8 TIMES GOING 2 MILES TO THE GROCERY STORE.   I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM MY LOCAL LINCOLN DEALER IN MAY OF 2001 AND HAVE HAD THE PROBLEM SINCE THE SECOND DAY. VEHICLE SERVICE RECORDS INDICATE THE COMPUTER WAS REPLACED TWICE.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
