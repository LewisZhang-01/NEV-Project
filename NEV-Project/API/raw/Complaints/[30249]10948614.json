THIS WAS NOT A RECALL ACCORDING TO KIA.  AFTER LOOKING ONLINE MANY OTHER KIA OWNERS HAVE FACED SAME ISSUE WITH THE SORENTO AND OTHER KIA MODELS.  UNDER WARRANTY, DEALERS HAVE CHANGED OUT SEATS AND RESOLVED THE AIRBAG ISSUE.  MOST CASES THOUGH, DEALER WANTS TO CHARGE TO CORRECT THIS VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY ISSUE!  THIS SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED AND MADE A RECALL FOR KIA OWNERS.  IF YOUR DEPARTMENT WOULD INVESTIGATE THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS ISSUE, I'M SURE YOU'D AGREE THAT A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I HOPE YOU WILL ADDRESS THIS ISSUE ASAP.  *TR",
