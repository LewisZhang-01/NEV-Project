MENTIONED TO DEALER ABOUT PREVIOUS CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS AS WELL AS HONDA'S TRANSMISSION WARRANTY EXTENSION FOR 2000 AND 2001 MODEL YEARS.  REBUILT TRANSMISSION ORDERED AND INSTALLED BY DEALER.  ROAD TEST FINDS SLIPPING IN GEARS SO A 2ND ONE IS ORDERED AND INSTALLED BY DEALER.  HONDA DID NOT CHARGE BUT SHOULD HAVE EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR 1999 MODELS IN THE FIRST PLACE.   HOPE THE DUPLICATE COMPLAINTS ENTERED BY CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS DOES NOT DILUTE ODI'S  DETERMINATION OR INVESTIGATION OF HOW WIDESPREAD THIS PROBLEM IS.      *TT",
