AFTER FURTHER CHECKING, HE INFORMED ME THAT THE HEAD GASKET WAS LEAKING AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  HE TOLD ME IT WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY $1200.  I AM IN THE PROCESS NOW OF CALLING OTHER GARAGES FOR QUOTES.   A CO-WORKER TOLD ME SHE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH HER NEON AND THE DEALER COVERED MOST OF THE COST SINCE THIS IS AN ON-GOING PROBLEM WITH NEONS.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW ANY INFORMATION YOU HAVE ON THIS ON-GOING HEAD GASKET PROBLEM.  I DON'T REMEMBER EXACT DAY IN APRIL I TOOK IT TO THE SHOP.  RECORDS ARE AT HOME.  IF YOU NEED EXACT DATE, I CAN FIND THAT.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.   *NLM",
