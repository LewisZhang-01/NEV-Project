THE WINDOWS WERE CONSTANTLY FOGGING UP MAKING DRIVING ONLY POSSIBLE BY LOWERING THE WINDOWS TO REDUCE FOGGING.  NOW, I HAVE NO HEAT AND THE MECHANIC SAYS IT IS MY BLOWER DOORS AND THAT THIS HAPPENS TO ALOT OF JEEPS.  WE HAD TO ABANDON THE VEHICLE DURING A SNOW / FREEZING RAIN EVEN LAST WEEK AND THEN COULDN'T DRIVE IT FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS DUE TO FREEZING CONDITIONS.  I HAVE REPLACED THE HEATER CORE DUE TO FOGGING WINDOWS 2 YEARS AGO AND THE AC HAD TO BE CHARGED CONSTANTLY TO STAY COOL.  THIS IS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE AND YOU FREEZE DURING COLD TIMES.  I ALWAYS HAVE TO MAKE SURE PRECIP IN NOT EXPECTED WHENEVER WE DRIVE THIS VEHICLE DURING WINTER MONTHS.  JEEP OWNERS NEED HELP WITH THIS...!  NOW MY PASSENGER WINDOW WONT GO UP EITHER. *TR",
