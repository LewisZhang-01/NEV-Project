I KNOW THAT DEALERSHIPS HAVE CERTIFIED MECHANICS.  THE PROBLEM IS, MY MOTHER'S CAR WOULD CRANK BUT WOULDN'T START. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP, AND THEY TOLD ME THAT I WOULD NEED A TURBO GASKET AND A MANIFOLD GASKET. WHEN THE JOB WAS DONE THEY TOLD ME THE BILL CAME TO SIX HUNDRED AND SOMETHING DOLLARS.  HOWEVER, MY CAR WAS STILL NOT RUNNING BECAUSE THAT WASN'T THE PROBLEM. THEY TOLD ME I NEED TO GET A NEW TURBO SYSTEM. THE PROBLEM IS, I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S FAIR FOR THE DEALERSHIPS, CERTIFIED MECHANIC TO BE MAKING GUESSES ON WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE CAR WHEN HE WENT TO SCHOOL TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT IT.  AT THIS POINT, I HAVE TO PAY OUT OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR SOMETHING I DON'T NEED, THE CAR IS STILL NOT RUNNING, BECAUSE THE MECHANIC DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG.  ON TOP OF THAT, YOU CAN'T TAKE YOUR CAR TO NO PLACE BETTER THAN THE DEALERSHIP  .*AK    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
