        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING MY 1994 HARLEY DAVIDSON WHEN OUT OF THE BLUE MY REAR WHEEL LOCKED UP CAUSING THE BIKE TO GO INTO A SKID AND COME TO AN UNINTENDED/ABRUPT STOP.  I LOOKED AT THE REAR WHEEL AND WAS HORRIFIED TO SEE THAT NONE OF THE SPOKES WERE ATTACHED TO THE HUB AND THAT THE SPROCKET AND ROTOR WERE RESTING ON THE GRAVEL.  THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED APPROXIMATELY 10 AM FATHERS DAY MORNING 3 MILES FROM MY HOME.  THE REAR RIM HAD LESS THAN 300 MILES ON IT SINCE THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND TIME I HAVE RIDDEN THIS YEAR AND THE DAY BEFORE WAS THE ONLY OTHER DAY.  BOTH OF THE RIMS ON THE BIKE ARE THE AMERICAN WIRE WHEEL, 40 SUPER SPOKE RIMS AND WERE NEW.  THANK GOD I WAS ON ONE OF THE STRAIGHT SECTIONS OF ROAD WHEN THIS HAPPENED.  I HAVE MANY PICTURES, SOME AT THE SCENE MOMENTS AFTER THE INCIDENT.   *NLM",
