MY CAR SHOULD FALL UNDER THIS AS IT WILL NOT PASS EMISSIONS AND THEREFORE REGISTRATION DUE TO THE FUEL SYSTEM WHICH STALLS OUT EVERY TIME I FILL UP FOR GAS. MY CAR WAS MANUFACTURED IN JULY. ADDITIONALLY, THE SUSPENSION NEEDS TO BE COMPLETELY REPLACED DUE TO FAILURE. EVEN MY MECHANIC IS COMPLETELY BAFFLED WHY A NEWER CAR WOULD HAVE SO MANY SAFETY ISSUES.",
