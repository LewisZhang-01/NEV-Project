WE'VE BEEN INFORMED IF THE LIGHT DOES NOT GO OFF THE PASSENGER WILL NOT BE PROTECTED BY THE AIR BAG SYSTEM. WE'VE BEEN TOLD TO TURN THE CAR OFF THEN RESTART IT THAT THIS WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THIS MEANS WE HAVE TO LEAVE THE ROAD FIND A PLACE TO PARK SHUT THE CAR OFF AND RESTART IT.  THIS CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT WHEN ON THE FREEWAY. OUR CONCERN IS SOMETIME WE MAY NOT NOTICE THE AIR BAG LIGHT IS ON, HAVE AN ACCIDENT AND THE PASSENGER WON'T BE PROTECTED BY THE AIR BAGS. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON HUNDREDS OF TIMES SINCE WE BOUGHT THE CAR BRAND NEW IN JUNE 2016 AND NISSAN TELLS US THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT.    *JS",
