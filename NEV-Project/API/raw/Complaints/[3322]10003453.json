UNLESS MY CASE IS UNIQUE, THE AEVIT/WL STEERING SYSTEM IS BEING RECOMMENDED BY DRIVING EVALUATORS FOR DRIVERS WITH SEVERELY REDUCED UPPER-BODY STRENGTH; EVEN WHEN THE DRIVER HAS BEEN DRIVING WITH A STEERING SYSTEM WITH LESS RESISTANCE AND THE DRIVER??S DISABILITY HAS A HISTORY OF FUNCTIONAL PROGRESSION.  OTHER DISABLED DRIVERS WITH LIMITED UPPER-BODY STRENGTH ARE PROBABLY USING THESE OTHER SYSTEMS WITH LESS RESISTANCE AND CANNOT TRANSFER THE ONE THEY ARE USING OR ACQUIRE ANOTHER SYSTEM LIKE IT FOR A NEWER VEHICLE.  AS DISABLED DRIVERS ARE FORCED TO CONVERT TO AEVIT/WL STEERING SYSTEM VEHICLE ACCIDENTS WILL INCREASE.    THE AEVIT/WL STEERING SYSTEM IS FURTHER DEFICIENT BECAUSE THE ORTHOPEDIC DEVICES PERMITTED BY THE MANUFACTURER ARE SO LIMITED OR INADAPTABLE THAT THE DRIVER??S CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE IS REDUCED.    THE EFFECT OF EITHER OR BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS WILL BE TO CREATE SAFETY HAZARDS WHERE NONE EXISTED PREVIOUSLY OR PREVENT DISABLED DRIVERS FROM CONTINUING TO DRIVE.",
