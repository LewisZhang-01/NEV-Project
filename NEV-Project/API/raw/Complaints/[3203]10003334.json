THE INSTALLER INSISTS, HOWEVER, THAT THEY SHOULD BE RUN 5 PSI LOWER (I.E. 27 PSI) THAN NOMINAL.  I THINK THAT RUNNING AT THE LOWER PRESSURE IS DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY IN NORTHERN VERMONT WHERE FRIGID TEMPERATURES DROP TIRE PRESSURES EVEN LOWER.  THE TIRE MANUFACTURER'S CONSUMER WEBSITE HAS BEEN UNRESPONSIVE. PLEASE ADVISE WHERE I CAN GET EXPERT ADVICE ON THIS MATTER.",
