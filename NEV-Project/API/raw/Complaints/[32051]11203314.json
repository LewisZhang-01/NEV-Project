THEY DIDN'T SEE A LEAK AND BELIEVED THERE MUST HAVE BEEN AN AIR BUBBLE IN THE SYSTEM THAT WORKED ITSELF OUT AND ADDED MORE COOLANT. LESS THAN A MONTH AFTER THAT THE LOW COOLANT LIGHT CAME BACK ON AGAIN AND I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE IN TO BE SERVICED. THEY DETERMINED THAT THERE'S AN INTERNAL LEAK AND COOLANT HAD BEEN LEAKING INTO THE ENGINE. THEY HAVE RECOMMENDED REPLACING THE ENGINE AND SAY THAT THIS ISSUE IS DIFFERENT THAN THE COOLANT RELATED RECALL THAT MY CAR HAD BEEN ORIGINALLY SERVICED FOR. THIS CAR IS A 2014 WITH LESS THAN 100K MILES ON IT. IT SHOULD NOT NEED A NEW ENGINE.",
