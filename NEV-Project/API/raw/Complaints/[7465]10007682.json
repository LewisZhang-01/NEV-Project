IT SEEMS THE CAR DIDNT KNOW WHAT GEAR IT WAS IN. AFTER HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ATTEMPTING TO FIND THE PROBLEM HONDA CORP. ASSURED ME THEY HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH A PROBLEM IN ANY OF THEIR CARS AND HAD NOT HAD ANY COMPLAINTS ON ANY OF THEIR 1998 ACCORDS. THEY THEN CHARGED ME 1,500 DOLLAR FOR THE REPAIR NOT COUNTING THE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS I PAID THEM TO SIMPLY FIND THE PROBLEM. NOW JUST 6 MONTHS LATER MY TRANSMISSION FEELS AS IF IT'S SLIPPING WHEN I PARK ON A HILL. AGAIN THEY DON'T WANT TO ADMITT TO ANY KNOWLEDGE OF ANY PAST PROBLEMS. NOW I'M SURE THEY ARE AWARE OF PAST PROBLEMS BECAUSE IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME THE TRANSMISSION I RECEIVED 6 MONTHS AGO WAS A REPAIRED TRANSMISSION FROM ANOTHER ACCORD. WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP MYSELF????? ANYONE  PLEASE HELP!",
