        "summary": "FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS, I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THE HEATER ONLY BLOWING WARM AIR ON THE DRIVER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE AND COLD AIR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. THIS IS A LITTLE UNBEARABLE IN THE WINTER TIME. TO OFFSET THE COLDNESS I BASICALLY HAVE TO WARM MY CAR UP FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES WITH THE PASSENGER SIDE VENTS CLOSED TO DRIVE WITH A COMFORTABLE OR REASONABLE TEMPERATURE.     UPON LIFTING THE FRONT HOOD TO CHECK MY ANTIFREEZE LEVEL,  I NOTICED MY OVERFLOW TANK HAS ABOUT 1 INCH OF BROWN SLUDGE AT THE BOTTOM. AFTER TAKING MY VEHICLE TO 5 DIFFERENT MECHANICS, THE GENERAL CONSENSUS IS THIS IS A HEATING CORE PROBLEM THAT IS APPARENTLY A WELL-KNOWN AND DOCUMENTED ISSUE WITH THE DODGE AVENGER. TO NOT RECOGNIZE THIS PROBLEM AS A SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED VIA A RECALL IS VERY DISTURBING. THE COST OF HAVING THIS REPAIRED IS SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF $900 TO $1800.    WHILE I COULD \"TRADE\" THIS CAR IN FOR ANOTHER I WOULD REALLY PREFER TO KEEP THIS VEHICLE.",
