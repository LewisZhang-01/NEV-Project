THE DEALER WAS GREAT AND VERY PREPARED TO HANDLE THIS PROBLEM THE BEST THEY COULD, HOWEVER VW CANNOT MAKE THE PARTS FAST ENOUGH TO SATISFY THE DEMAND AND I WILL HAVE A LOANER CAR FOR AT LEAST 3 WEEKS. I KNOW THAT VW WILL ONLY REPLACE THE COIL THAT FAILED SO I GUESS I CAN LOOK FORWARD TO THIS HAPPENING SEVERAL TIMES IN THE FUTURE. GREAT. I AM DISAPPOINTED AND MAD THAT VW KNOWS ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND IS UNWILLING TO REPLACE ALL 4 LEAVING ME TO BREAK DOWN AGAIN.",
