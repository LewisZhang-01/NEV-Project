        "summary": "2003 FORD CROWN VICTORIA PURCHASED IN 1/03 HAS REPEATED ENGINE VIBRATIONS THAT ARE NOTICED WHILE IDLING IN DRIVE AND APPLYING THE BRAKE. THE INDICATIONS FEEL LIKE THE ENGINE IS MISSING AND GETS WORSE AFTER DIRVING MORE THAN THIRTY MINUTES. THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN TO THREE DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS WITH NOT RESOLVE. THE ONE HONEST DEALSHIP WAS FRIENDLY FORD IN CROSBY TEXAS AND THEY TOLD ME THAT FORD ENGINEERING WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AND I WOULD HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THE VIBRATION UNTIL THEY FOUND A SOLUTION. THE ENGINEER TOLD THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT THEY HAVE TO LOWER THE IDLE \"THE CAUSE\" TO MEET FEDERAL EMMISSION CONTROL STANDARDS. I HAVE JUST RETURNED FROM SETTING IN A BRAND NEW CROWN VICTORIA THAT DOES NOT MISS LIKE MIND DOES. IT SEEMS THAT FORD KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND DID NOT CARE WHAT THE CONSUMER HAD TO PUT UP WITH. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT FORD IS HAVING ALOT OF ENGINE PROBLEMS WITH THE CROWN VICTORIA POLICE INTERCEPTOR. HOW CAN FORD SELL A CAR THAT IS BELOW PAR AND MISLEAD CONSUMERS. I PAID ALMOST THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A CAR THAT FEELS LIKE IT IS RUNNING ON SEVEN OF THE EIGHT CYLINDERS. CAN YOU PLEASE ADVISE ME OF WHERE I CAN GO FROM HERE.   REGARDS,  TED MATUSZEWSKI",
