I HAVE A 4 CYLINDER ENGINE. THAT MEANS I HAVE ONE COIL ON EACH CYLINDER. I HAD 1 COIL GO BAD. WHEN THEY GO BAD WHILE YOU ARE DRIVING YOU LOSE POWER TO THE CAR AND ARE UNABLE TO DRIVE AT YOUR CURRENT SPEED. I HAD ONE COIL GO BAD IN MARCH OF 2003. VOLKSWAGEN WON'T REPLACE ALL THE COILS UNTIL THEY BREAK. I HAVE THREE MORE TO FIX BUT THEY WON'T FIX IT.  IT IS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE THE CAR OR TO TAKE LONG TRIPS WITH THE CAR DUE TO THE FACT YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THE COILS WILL BREAK.  *JB",
