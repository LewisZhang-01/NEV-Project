AFTER 3 DAYS, THE SERVICE ADVISOR CALLED TO INFORM ME THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING ON BECAUSE THE AIRBAG HAD FAILED.    THE CAR HAS NOT BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT, NOR HAS IT BEEN MODIFIED.  THE CHARGE TO REPLACE THE FAILED AIRBAG IS $1,300. THE SERVICE ADVISOR SAID HE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WOULD CAUSE THE AIRBAG TO FAIL IF WAS NOT IN AN ACCIDIENT AND HAD NOT BEEN MODIFIED.  I CALLED CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO TO HELP ME AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO WORK IT OUT WITH THE DEALER.  *AK",
