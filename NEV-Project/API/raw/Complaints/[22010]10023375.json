I HAVE HAD BOTH FRONT SPEED SENSORS REPLACED ABOUT 3-4 TIMES UNDER WARRANTY, AND SINCE THE WARRANTY HAS RUN OUT, I JUST DEAL WITH THE LIGHT.  I JUST BROUGHT IT IN FOR THIS PROBLEM ABOUT 6 WEEKS AGO, AND AGAIN THE COMPUTER DIAGNOSTICS SAID THAT IT WAS A SPEED SENSOR.  THIS PROBLEM HAS EXISTED SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR.   *NLM",
