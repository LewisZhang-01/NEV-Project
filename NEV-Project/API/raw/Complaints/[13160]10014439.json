        "summary": "FOLLOWING SAFETY REPORT WAS FILED WITH FORD MOTOR COMPANY ON-LINE:  =========================================  THE FORD RIGHT FRONT INNER BREAK PAD SEPARATED FROM ITS METAL BASE AND CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE ROTOR.  I WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE BREAK PROBLEM WHEN I STARTED HEARING A ROUGH METAL SOUND.  I HAD A PRIVATE TECHNICIAN TO REMOVE THE BREAK PADS AND ROTOR IMMEDIATELY.  THEN TOOK IT AND SHOWED IT TO THE FORD DEALER SWANSON FORD IN LOS GATOS, CALIFORNIA.  THE DEALER WAS RELUCTANT TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THE BREAK PAD WAS SPLIT APART, HE HAS INSISTENT ON IT WAS PAD WEAR.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THE FORD DEALER TECHNICIAN, IT IS VISUAL AND VERY NOTICEABLE THAT THE BREAK PAD HAS SPLIT APART FROM ITS METAL BASE, IT WAS NOT A WEAR OUT DOWN TO THE METAL BASE.  THIS IS UNSAFE AND MAY CAUSE UNNECESSARY ACCIDENTS.  THE SAME PROBLEM MAY HAPPEN TO OTHER DRIVERS TOO.  THIS IS WHY I AM INSISTING ON A FACTORY REPRESENTATIVE TO GET BACK TO ME IN A VERY SHORT TIME.  DUE TO SAFETY REASON I WILL HAVE NO CHOICE TO TURN ALL THE EVIDENCE TO THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT IF FORD CORPORATION DOES NOT COME FORWARD TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM AND PAY FOR THE ADDITIONAL DAMAGES CAUSED DUE TO MALFUNCTION OF THE BREAK PAD ASSEMBLY.  I WOULD LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER PROPER IMMEDIATE ACTION REGARDING THIS MATTER, AND I WOULD LIKE A FORD FIELD ENGINEER TO LOOK INTO THE MATTER NOT A TECHNICIAN OR A MECHANIC FROM A FORD DEALER, SPECIALLY NOT ANYONE FROM THE SWANSON FORD IN LOS GATOS CALIFORNIA.  YOUR IMMEDIATE REPLY IS EXPECTED UPON RECEIPT OF THIS EMAIL. I RECOMMEND YOU CONTACTING MY FATHER [XXX] WHO IS THE CO-SIGNER ON THE CAR.  HIS EMAIL ADDRESS IS: [XXX]  AND HIS CELL NUMBER IS [XXX], HOME NUMBER IS THE SAME, THE CAR IS REGISTERED AT THE SAME ADDRESS, TO THE MY FATHER'S ADDRESS AT: [XXX].
