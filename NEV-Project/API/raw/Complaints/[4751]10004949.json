THE SEAT BELT APPEARS SECURE AT FIRST, BUT IT GRADUALLY LOOSENS AS THE WEIGHT OF THE CHILD SEAT ROCKS AGAINST IT.  THE BELT LOOSENED COMPLETELY AFTER 30 MINUTES OF DRIVING, AND WOULD HAVE BEEN USELESS IN A CRASH.  FORTUNATELY, WE DISCOVERED THE PROBLEM BEFORE ANYONE WAS HURT.  WE WENT TO DUDDIE FORD OF NORTHBOROUGH, MA ON 1/29/03 AND PRESENTED THE PROBLEM.",
