AT MY EXPENSE  HAVE SINCE FOUND OUT THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH THIS MOTOR AND CHRYSLER WONT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT, I HAVE MAINTAINED THIS CAR WITH REGULAR OIL CHANGES EVERY   3000 T0 3500 MILES. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THE COST IS 5000.00 TO REPLACE THE ENGINE.  I AM DEVISTATED BY THIS AND THINK CHRYSLER NEEDS TO OWN UP TO ITS DEFECTIVE MOTORS.  *AK",
