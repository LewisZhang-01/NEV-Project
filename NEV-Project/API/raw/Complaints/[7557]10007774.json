        "summary": "MY 17-YEAR-OLD SON WAS DRIVING TO EDINBURG, TEXAS ON A PRETTY BUSY STREET, WHEN OUT OF THE BLUE THE ENGINE STARTED TO FAIL. HE NEARLY GOT KILLED. THANK GOD THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN. THE CAR CRACKED THE HEAD, AND IS IN NEED OF MAJOR REPAIR. THIS HAS HAPPENED THREE TIMES SINCE THE CAR WAS BOUGHT. ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE THE LAST INCIDENT, I NOTICED THAT THE COOLANT WATER WAS A BROWN, ALMOST MUDDY COLOR AND TEXTURE. I FIGURED IT WAS JUST LEFT OVER DAMAGE FROM THE ENGINE REPAIRS IT HAD RECEIVED. AFTER DOING A LOT OF RESEARCH I FOUND THAT FORD HAD A CUSTOMER SATISFACTION NOTICE PROGRAM FOR A \"BROWN COOLANT RECALL.\" I NEVER GOT THE NOTICE AND MY WARRANTY EXPIRED A LONG TIME AGO. THIS IS CLEARLY A FULL OUT ''RECALL.'' I WOULD LIKE FOR THE NHTSA TO GET FORD TO PAY FOR THE DAMAGES THAT THEY HAVE CAUSED. MANY PEOPLE ALL OVER THE INTERNET HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. I AM CURRENTLY STILL PAYING FOR THE CAR AND IT IS NOT FAIR FOR FORD TO GET AWAY WITH THIS NON-SENSE. MY SON COULD HAVE DIED ALL BECAUSE FORD DIDN''T PROPERLY NOTIFY ME. I WILL CALL FORD TOMORROW AND EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED. IF THEY DON''T HELP, AND THE NHTSA DOESN''T HELP EITHER, I WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO SUE FORD. THIS IS TOTAL NONSENSE. I'M NOT TRYING TO STEAL THEIR MONEY, I JUST WANT FOR THEM TO PAY FOR THEIR OWN SCREW UP.",
