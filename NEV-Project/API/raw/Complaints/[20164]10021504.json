MANAGING TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, I GOT OUT OF THE CAR FULLY EXPECTING TO SEE A COW OR HORSE EMBEDDED INTO THE SIDE OF MY CAR.  HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO DAMAGE - A PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATIVE ENGINEER HAS VERIFIED THAT.  VOLKSWAGEN IS TAKING NO RESPONSIBILITY DUE TO THE FACT THE SENSOR READS \u001cCRASH DATA STORED.\u001d  FROM THE LOOKS OF THE NUMBER OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS, I CAN SEE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME A VW JETTA HAS HAD THIS HAPPEN.  VW NEEDS TO OWN UP TO THIS DEFECT.*JB",
