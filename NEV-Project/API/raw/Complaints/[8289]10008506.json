RECEIVED  RECALL NOTICE FROM FORD MOTOR COMPANY DURING MAY OF 2002 AND HAD SERVICE COMPLETED MAY 29TH OF 2002. ON FEBRUARY 28TH 2003 THE SAME TRUCK ROLLED OFF ANOTHER HILL WHILE IN FIRST GEAR WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ON, AFTER BEING PARKED OVER 45 MINUTES! THERE SEEMS TO BE A DESIGN PROBLEM WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKES AND/OR TRANSMISSIONS/GEAR RATIO IN THIS MODEL TRUCK***RECALL DID NOT WORK!!!!. A PERSON SHOULD BE ABLE TO PUT THIS TRUCK IN EITHER FIRST GEAR OR REVERSE WITH THE EMERGENCY BRAKE ON AND COME BACK AND FIND YOUR TRUCK PARKED IN THE SAME PLACE, NOT TWO BLOCKS AWAY ON TOP OF ANOTHER CAR! ESPECIALLY AFTER A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM!!!! ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. HOW ELSE IS THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO PARK THESE VEHICLES? THIS PROBLEM HAS RUINED THREE VEHICLES, MY FLAWLESS INSURANCE RECORD AND IS GOING TO KILL SOMEBODY IF IT ALREADY HASN'T.*JB",
