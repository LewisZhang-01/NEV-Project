WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT, THE PASSANGER REAR SIDE POWER WINDOW WASN'T WORKING AND I FIX IT, THEN RECENTLY BEGINING THIS YEAR I FOUND OUT IT WAN'T MOVING AGAIN? I WONDER WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?   AT THE SAME TIME, THIS HAPPENED LAST YEAR WINTER 2002 WHILE I WAS DRIVING DURING THE SNOWING NIGHT, THE WINDSHIELD WATER PUMP AMD THE WIPER SUDDENDLY FAIL, AND THIS COULD CAUSE A DANGER DURING WINTER OR RAINING DAY. THEREFORE I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THIS 300M WHETHER A RELIABLE CAR TO HAVE?    2/5/03  THANK YOU",
