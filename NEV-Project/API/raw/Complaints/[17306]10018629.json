ROTORS SHOULD LAST A LOT LONGER, EARLY WEAR IS MOST LIKELY DUE TO IMPROPER DESIGN, VENTING, MATERIAL AND WILL RECUR ONCE REPLACED. DODGE WILL DO NOTHING, AS THEY CLAIM THEY COVER ONLY 12K MILES ON DEFECTS. I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S A DEFECT, BUT RATHER A DESIGN ISSUE, WHICH THE CONSUMER CANNOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR, OR AVOID EVEN WITH EXTRA-EASY DRIVING. THERE IS NO ALTERNATE ROTOR AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME THROUGH DODGE.  *JB",
