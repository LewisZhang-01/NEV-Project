PROBLEM SEEMS THIS SCARFING REDUCES THE BRAKE SHOE AREA APPLIED TO THE BRAKE ROTOR AND THUS REDUCED BRAKING AND INCREASE OF STOPPING DISTANCE.  IN PASTED TIME A FEW COMPANIES USED THIS PRACTICE, BUT NOW IS MORE COMMON. I JUST PURCHASE A SET OF CERAMIC BRAKE PADS WITH THIS TYPE OF MANUFACTURING PRACTICE, THEY WERE MADE IN CANADA.  I BELIEVE ANY TYPE OF THESE SHOES SHOULD NOT BE SOLD.  GO BACK TO WHAT THE CAR MANUFACTURE HAS ENGINEERED FOR THEIR VEHICLE. *TR",
