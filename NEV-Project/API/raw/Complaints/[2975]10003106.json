        "summary": "2002 PASSAT 1.8.  STARTED OKAY.  AS I DROVE, HORRIBLE SOUND & RAN VERY ROUGH-SPUTTTERED & RUMBLED.  ENGINE LIGHT BLINKING ON & OFF.  AS I GAVE IT GAS, THE WORSE IT GOT.  TURNED AROUND, WENT HOME, CALLED DEALERSHIP.   WAS TOLD \"NOT TO DRIVE IT & TO GET IT TOWED, AS THERE HAS BEEN A PROBLEM WITH THE 1.8S AND THE COILS THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF.\"  WAS THERE A MONTH AGO FOR ANOTHER ENGINE PROBLEM-NOT SURE WHAT THEY DID BECAUSE THE SERVICE ADVISOR COULD NOT EXPLAIN IT TO ME!  HAVE RENTAL CAR-THANKFULLY PASSAT IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY-11,416 MILES, AND WAS BOUGHT ON JANUARY 5, 2002!  THE DEALERSHIP CALLED ME TODAY, CAR IS READY, AND THEY \"REPLACED A BAD IGNITION COIL.\"  NOT UNDERSTANDING HOW A CAR WITH 11,000 MILES ON IT COULD HAVE SOMETHING BAD ON IT, I DID SOME RESEARCH ON THE WEB.  IT APPEARS THAT THIS IS A COMMON OCCURENCE, AND IT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN, AS DEALERSHIPS ARE ONLY PLACING ONE COIL AT A TIME.  ANOTHER COIL MAY GO AT ANY TIME!  I SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH TOYOTA.......",
