        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 2003 FORD F-250 SUPER DUTY CREW CAB WITH 6.0 DIESEL IN LATE JANUARY OF THIS YEAR.  THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON IN OREGON. I PULLED INTO THE FORD HOUSE IN COOS BAY ON SATURDAY.  THEY COULDN'T WORK ON IT UNTIL MONDAY.  TUESDAY THEY SAID IT WAS AN INJECTOR SEAL PROBLEM.  THEY SAID THEY DRAINED 28 QUARTS OF FLUID FROM THE CRANKCASE, WHICH HAD A 15 QT CAPACITY.  THE REST, THEY SAID, WAS DIESEL BLOW-BY.  THEY REPLACED 3 SENSORS AND 1 INJECTOR AND INSTALLED A NEW COMPUTER UPDATE.  WE PICKED UP THE TRUCK AND LEFT TOWN THE FOLLOWING THURSDAY.  ON THE WAY OUT OF TOWN THE TURBO INTAKE HOSE BLEW OFF.  WE RETURNED AND HAD IT FIXED.  SEVERAL DAYS LATER WE WERE IN TEXAS WHEN THE TURBO EXHAUST HOSE BLEW OFF.  THAT, TOO WAS REPAIRED.  AT HOME, THE TRUCK WAS RUNNING ROUGH AND THE FUEL MILEAGE DROPPED FROM 20 MPG TO 13 MPG.  I TOOK IT IN AGAIN AND THEY REPLACED 2 OTHER INJECTORS AND INSTALLED ANOTHER COMPUTER UPDATE. THIS PAST WEEK THE TRUCK WAS AGAIN RUNNING ROUGH AND THE FUEL MILEAGE WAS DOWN.  I TOOK IT IN AND THEY REPLACED A SENSOR AND INSTALLED YET ANOTHER DOWNLOAD.  THIS IS NOT WHAT I BARGAINED FOR WHEN I BOUGHT THIS TRUCK.         *TT",
