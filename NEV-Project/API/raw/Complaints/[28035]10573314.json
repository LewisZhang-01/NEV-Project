MY VEHICLE HAS GAS PEDAL ACCELERATION AFTER THE ACCIDENT AND WHEN I PUT THE BRAKES TO STOP OR SLOW DOWN THE VEHICLE MY VEHICLE JUMPS UP AND INCREASES THE SPEED. I FEAR THAT THIS FAULTY PARTS OF BRAKE OR GAS PADDLE COULD RESULT IN ANOTHER SERIOUS ACCIDENT.     THIS IS MY VERY VALUED ASSET BECAUSE IT TAKES ME TO WORK AND BRINGS ME BACK.    I HOPE THAT TOYOTA WILL INVESTIGATE MY PROBLEM VERY SERIOUSLY AND VERY CAREFULLY.    MY INJURIES ARE VERY SERIOUS AND LONG LASTING AND I AM SEEING DOCTORS FOR THE LAST 13 MONTHS. I NEED HELP VERY VERY SOON.    [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
