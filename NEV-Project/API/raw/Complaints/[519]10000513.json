ALL OCCUPANTS OF THE VAN WERE WEARING LAP AND SHOULDER SEAT BELTS AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT.  THE DRIVER'S SEAT BACK COLLAPSED BACKWARDS CAUSING ME TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.  THE FORCE FROM THE HONDA STRIKING THE VAN WAS SUFFICIENT TO DRIVE IT FORWARD INTO THE CHEVROLET PICKUP STOPPED IN FRONT OF THE VAN.  BEING UNABLE TO SEE OVER THE DASHBOARD OR HANG UNTO THE STEERING WHEEL, THERE WAS NO OPPORTUNITY TO TRY AND AVOID THE PARKED VEHICLE IN FRONT OF THE VAN.  MY DAUGHTER WHO WAS SEATED IN THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE SEAT WAS THROWN ABOUT IN THE BACK OF THE VAN AS HER SEAT BELT DID NOT LOCK IN POSITION, WHEN THE VAN STRUCK THE PICKUP THAT WAS STOPPED IN FRONT OF THE VAN.  MY DAUGHTER AND I EXPERIENCED MUSCLE SPASMS FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT.  FURTHER AS MY DAUGHTER WAS EXPERIENCING SEVERE NECK PAIN FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT, SHE WAS TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL FOR EVALUATION. TS",
