WHEN  FILL MY XTERRA WITH GAS, IT OVERFLOWS EVERYTIME UNLESS I MANUALLY STOP THE PROCESS BY GUESSING HOW MANY GALLONS I HAVE PUT IN.  AT THAT POINT THE GAS SPLASHES OUT AND OVERFLOWS.  THEN WHEN I START MY CAR. THE GAS GAUGE ONLY SHOWS 3/4 TANK FULL, NEVER COMPLETELY FILLED.  WHEN I FIRST BOUT THIS VEHICLE IN OCTOBER OF 2000, THIS PROBLEM WAS PRESENT BUT THE DEALERSHIP COULD NOT FIX IT.  THEN I READ ABOUT THE RECALL 2 YEARS LATER ON THE INTERNET AND DECIDED TO TAKE IT IN AGAIN.  THE SECOND TIME, I TOOK MY XTERRA TO A LOCAL NISSAN DEALERSHIP ABOUT THE RECAL ISSUED BY NHTSA IN 2002 BUT THEYSAID MY VEHICLE  WAS NOT PART OF  RECALL DUE TO VIN.  *AK",
