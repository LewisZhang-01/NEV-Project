        "summary": "ON SEPTEMBER 27,2009,WE WERE DRIVING FROM DULUTH, MINN. TO FARGO, N.D. AT NIGHT,WHEN WITHOUT ANY NOTICE ALL ELECTRICAL ON OUR SUBURBAN SHUT DOWN FOR ABOUT 3 SECONDS AT 62 M.P.H. WE WERE ON A TWO LANE ROAD WITH AN ONCOMING VEHICLE. COULD /SHOULD HAVE BEEN A BAD ACCIDENT !!!   LIGHTS CAME ON AGAIN IN TIME TO SAVE US. IT HAPPENED AGAIN MILES DOWN THE ROAD FOR ABOUT 3 SECONDS AGAIN.  LATER THAT NEXT WEEK VEHICLE WENT DEAD AGAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF INTERSECTION.  IT WENT DEAD A FIFTH TIME AND WOULD NOT START AGAIN.  I FINALLY GOT OUT AND WIGGLED THE BATTERY CABLE BRACKET, AFTER CALLING A MECHANIC FRIEND OF MINE.  HE TOLD ME A LOOSE BATTERY POST COULD ACT LIKE THIS.  HE WAS RIGHT.  I WIGGLED THE POST (+), WHICH WAS VERY LOOSE ,OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FREEWAY, AND GOT BACK IN THE VEHICLE AND THE VEHICLE STARTED.  BOTH BRACKETS COMING OFF BOTH POSTS WERE LOOSE. THE BATTERY WAS A SEARS DIEHARD PLATINUM PURCHASED ON 1-5-2008.  I GOT A NEW BATTERY THAT WAS PRORATED.  THEY COULD HAVE CARED LESS ABOUT MY SITUATION.  '!@#$% LUCKY NO ONE WAS KILLED LET ALONE INJURED !!   YOU NEED TO ACT ON THE ABOVE FACTS A.S.A.P., AS AFTER AN ACCIDENT IT WOULD BE HARD TO PROVE THAT THE ACCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY BATTERY FAILURE, LIKE ON A FREEWAY  SMASH UP ETC:.  THERE ARE MANY OTHER BRANDS OF BATTERIES WITH ANGLE BRACKETS COMING OFF THE NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE POST WITH SIDE MOUNT BATTERY CABLES !!  I FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS DEFECTIVE BATTERY AND BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE PULLED FROM SERVICE UNTIL THE BRACKETS ARE REPLACED BY A MORE FOOL PROOF ENGINEERING.  WE HAD AN ENGINEER RIDING IN THE CAR WITH US AND HE ALSO SAID THE BATTERY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE SOLD UNTIL A NEW SYSTEM IS DEVELOPED THAT DOES NOT USE ANGLE BRACKETS IS FOUND.  THE BRACKETS LOOSEN UP AND CAUSE ARCING AND LEAD TO CORROSION WHERE THEY ATTACH TO A HIDDEN POST(S).  THE BRACKETS NEED TO BE DONE AWAY WITH COMPLETELY !!   PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR ANY FURTHER EXPLANATION AND FACT(S).  I EXPECT A PROMPT REPLY !!! *TR",
