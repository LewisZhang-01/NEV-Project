        "summary": "I JUST HAD MY THIRD MOPAR REBUILT TRANSMISSION INSTALLED TWO WEEKS AGO IN MY 97 PLYMOUTH GRAND VOYAGER--3 SPEED AUTOMATIC--3.0 LITRE.  I BOUGHT THIS 97 PLY GRAND VOYAGER WITH 30K MILES FROM A REPUTABLE DEALER.  THIS ORIGINAL TRANS WENT AT 75K.  I THEN HAD THE FIRST MOPAR REBUILT INSTALLED AND REPLACED WITHIN 3,000 MILES DUE TO A FLATLY TORQUE CONVERTER.   THE SECOND, AND THIRD WERE REPLACED, AT 85K AND 97K, RESPECTFULLY, DUE TO THE SAME PROBLEM.      THIS TORQUE CONVERTER, \"SHUTTERING\", PROBLEM IS THE MAIN SYMPTOM.  MOPAR HAS REPLACED THE TRANSMISSIONS, PARTS AND LABOR, WITHOUT DELAY.  MY QUESTION---WHY IS THIS HAPPENING SOOOOOOO OFTEN?  THE WARRANTY IS GOOD OF 36/36,000 MILES, WHICH EXPIRES AT 111,000.  IS THERE ANY RECOURSE TO THIS SITUATION?  IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH THESE TRANSMISSIONS?    WAYNE EFFERSON.   *JB",
