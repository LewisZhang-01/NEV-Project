WHEN THEY HAD THE HEADGASKET OFF THEY CALLED ME TO THE MY CAR AND SAID THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE GEAR GASKET OR IT WOULD CAUSE THE HEADH\\GASKET TO \"GO BAD\" AGAIN. WHEN I ASKED THEM WHY THE GEAR GASKET WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE FREE REPLACEMENT THEN HAS NO ANSWER. IT COST ME $567.29 TO HAVE THEM REPLACE THE GEAR GASKET. I THINK THAT THIS IS A BATE AND SWITCH. WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT THIS RIPOFF?",
