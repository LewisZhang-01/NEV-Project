        "summary": "IN JUNE 2006, I PURCHASED A NEW 2006 TOYOTA RAV 4 SPORT.  GREAT VEHICLE.  I DRIVE 100 MILES A DAY ROUND TRIP TO WORK.  AS OF 1/12/07, THERE ARE 15,725 MILES ON THE VEHICLE.  AROUND 12,500 MILES, I NOTICED A STRANGE GRINDING NOISE COMING FROM THE STEERING WHEN MAKING A HARD RIGHT OR LEFT TURN (TURNING INTO A PARKING PLACE OR MY DRIVEWAY).  I TALKED WITH THE TOYOTA DEALER AND THE FIRST ATTEMPT WAS TO HEAVILY LUBRICATE THE STEERING AS I WAS TOLD EVERYTHING WAS DRY.  THE CAR HAD BEEN SERVICED FOR AN OIL AND LUBE EVERY 4,000 MILES.  THIS DID NOT RESOLVE THE ISSUE.  I WAS TOLD THAT I NEEDED A NEW RACK AND PINION STEERING UNIT.  THE DEALER FORGOT TO ORDER THE PART.  AFTER A WEEK AND A HALF, I CALLED TO FIND OUT THAT THE PART WAS ON BACK ORDER AS THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE'S STEERING.  WHEN I ASKED IF I WAS SAFE DRIVING 100 MILES A DAY, AT SPEEDS OF 70 MPH ON THE FLORIDA TURNPIKE, I WAS TOLD TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE AT A SAFE SPEED OF 40 MPH.  (I INFORMED THE DEALER THAT I WOULD BE KILLED ON THE FLORIDA ROADS IF I DROVE THAT SLOW. - THEY AGREED.)  AGAIN, I ASKED IF I WAS SAFE.  THEN I WAS TOLD THAT ALTHOUGH THE PART WAS ON BACKORDER, THAT THEY WOULD SEE WHAT THEY COULD DO.  I WAS CALLED WITHIN AN HOUR AND TOLD THAT THE PART WOULD BE IN WITHIN A WEEK.  THE NEW RACK AND PINION UNIT AND GEARS WERE INSTALLED YESTERDAY.  ADDITIONALLY, A RECOMMENDED WHEEL ALIGNMENT WAS DONE, AND IT FEELS AS IF THE FRONT BRAKES WERE ADJUSTED.  THE VEHICLE FEELS GOOD, BUT THE CRUNCHING NOISE IS STILL THERE.    DOES TOYOTA HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING ON THESE VEHICLES?  IF SO, I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED.  I TRADED MY CHRYSLER FOR THE TOYOTA SO THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE DEALER FOR SERVICE ALL OF THE TIME.    THE REAL QUESTION IS:  AM I SAFE?????  *NM",
