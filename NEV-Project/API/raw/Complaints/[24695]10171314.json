I HAD TO MERGE THROUGH 5 LANES OF TRAFFIC TO GET TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD.  I REALIZED I WASN'T IN A VERY GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD AND WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR HELP I WAS APPROACHED BY WHAT APPEARED TO BE A GANG AND THEY TOOK ALL MY MONEY AND THREW ME TO THE GROUND.  AFTER ALL OF THIS I FIND OUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO BECAUSE THE ENGINE IS BLOWN TO OIL SLUDGE!  I JUST PURCHASES THE CAR 2 MONTHS AGO AND IT ONLY HAS 45,000 MILES ON IT!  PLUS I WAS ALMOST KILLED MERGING THROUGH TRAFFIC AND THEN BY A GANG!  CHRYSLER IS ONLY GOING TO GET SOMEONE KILLED BY IGNORING THIS OBVIOUS PROBLEM.  SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE.  *NM",
