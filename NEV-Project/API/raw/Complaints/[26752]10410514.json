TWO IN FACT BECAUSE THE FIRST COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WITH THE TRANSMISSION AND NEITHER COULD THE SECOND.  BUT WHEN I TURNED IT OFF COMPLETELY AND RESTARTED, IT RESET ITSELF AND IT WAS FINE.  DIDN'T HAPPEN FOR A GOOD WHILE, THEN AGAIN.  REPEAT THESE STEPS TO NOW, IT IS A FREQUENT OCCURANCE.  SINGLE MOM WITH FIVE YEAR OLD TWINS AND CAN'T AFFORD THIS THROTTLE BODY THING I AM READING ABOUT.  BUT CAN'T KEEP DRIVING MY KIDS IN THE CAR BECAUSE IT IS A SAFETY HAZZARD AS IT WILL JUST STOP MOVING ON THE HIGHWAY. ALSO, THE SEATBELT IN THE CENTER OF THE SECOND ROW LOCKED UP WHEN THE BACK WAS FOLDED DOWN AND I COULDN'T LIFT IT BACK UP.  HAD TO CUT IT TO LIFT THE SEAT BACK.  NOW, NO SEATBELT FOR MIDDLE RIDER.   *KB",
