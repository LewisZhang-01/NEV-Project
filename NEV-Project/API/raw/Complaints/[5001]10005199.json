PONTIAC DEALER SERVICE DEPT AND PONTIAC NATIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE CLAIM THIS IS NORMAL. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS ON ANY OTHER VEHICLE. THERE IS NO WAY TO SHUT OFF THE FLOW FROM THE MIDDLE (OVER THE RADIO) VENTS. TEHRE IS A \"WHEEL\" TO BLOCK THE FLOW TO THE CENTER-LEFT AND CENTER-RIGHT VENTS ABOVE THE RADIO, BUT NO SUCH CONTROL FOR THE CENTER-CENTER VENT--IT ONLY ADJUSTS UP/DOWN. THIS IS CAUSING DISCOMFORT BUT ABOVE ALL CAN DRY EYES OUT WHILE DRIVING. IT MAKES NO SENSE. EVEN THE SERVICE ADVISOR IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT IT WAS A DEFECT. HE CHANGED HIS MIND WHEN HE FOUND THE SAME CONDITION ON OTHER 2003 MONTANA ON LOT. I SUBMIT THAT THIS IS NOT NORMAL AND MAY REFLECT A DESIGN AND/OR MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT HAS SAFETY IMPLICATIONS. PLEASE NOTE THAT RECIRUCLATE IS DESIGNED NOT TO WORK IN ALL MODES EITHER.",
