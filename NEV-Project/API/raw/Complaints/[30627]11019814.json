        "summary": "OUR CRUISE CONTROL (CC) SWITCHES ON THE STEERING HAVE STOPPED WORKING!  THE BEHAVIOR WAS UN-PREDICABLE AND DANGEROUS FOR  WHILE WHEN HITTING CANCEL BUTTON WOULD \"ENGAGE\" THE CC.    THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE SINCE IT COULD CAUSE ACCIDENTS.      I BELIEVE THIS IS DUE TO THE POOR DESIGN ON THE CONNECTOR THAT CONNECTS THE WIRES FROM THE CC SWITCHES TO THE STEERING CASE.   THE CONNECTOR IS PLACED RIGHT UNDER THE HORN COVER AND WE BELIEVE THE CONNECTOR GETS SQUEEZED EVERY TIME THE HORN IS USED.      I TESTED THIS MYSELF AND WAS ABLE TO GET THE CC TO WORK AFTER LIFTING THE HORN COVERS FORWARD SECTION WHICH REDUCED  THE PRESSURE FROM THE CONNECTOR RIGHT UNDERNEATH IT  !  WHEN I DID THIS, HITTING THE CC.    ONCE AGAIN THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE CAUSE DRIVERS COULD ASSUME THEY ARE DISABLING THE CC, WHEN THEY COULD ACTUALLY BE ACTIVATING CC WHICH WILL CAUSE ACCIDENTS.",
