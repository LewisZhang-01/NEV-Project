I HAVE ASKED TWO DEALERS TO REPAIR THE HANDLE.  I AM TOLD THAT IT WILL COST IN EXCESS OF $500.00 TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE DOOR PANEL.  I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THIS EXPENSE TO REPLACE A $10-15.00 PART.  IT WAS A \"DEFECT\" IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE HANDLE, NOT ABUSE, THAT HAS CREATED THIS SITUATION.  I WAS IN TOUCH WITH CUSTOMER \"DISSERVICE\" ON ONE OCCASION, BUT THEY HAVE NOT RETURNED ANY OF MY CALLS SINCE.*JB",
