THE DEALERSHIP HAS GIVEN ME A STORY FROM CELL PHONES TO BAGS ON THE PASSENGER SEAT.  IT HAS HAD TO GO BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP EVERYTIME.  I HAVE NOTED ON YOUR WEBSITE NUMEROUS REPORTS OF THIS PROBLEM ON HONDA CIVICS.  I BELIEVE A RECALL SHOULD BE MADE FOR SAFETY MEASURES.  A FAILING AIRBAG CAN COST SOMEONE THEIR LIVES.*AK",
