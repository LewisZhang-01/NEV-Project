THE DEALER SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG AND THAT'S THE WAY THIS CAR IS. I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS NOT USE TO 4 WHEEL DISC BRAKES. (I DRIVE A 4 WHEEL DISC CAR AT WORK.) I INSISTED THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG. DEALER TURNED THE FRONT ROTORS WHICH DID NOT HELP. I INSTALLED HIGH PERFORMANCE DISC PADS ON ALL FOUR WHEELS WHICH HELPED A LOT BUT ONLY FOR ABOUT 20000 MILES. THE BRAKES USE TO WHEN THEY GOT WET. THIS CAR IS UNSAFE IN WET WEATHER! *TS  ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12-12-02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS***762002",
