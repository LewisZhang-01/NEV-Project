        "summary": "THE MOTOR DIES WHENEVER THE TURN SIGNALS ARE USED. THE VEHICLE USE TO START RIGHT UP AFTER THIS HAPPENS. BUT NOW INSTEAD OF STARTING RIGHT BACK UP, IT TAKES IT A FEW MINUTES. IT HAS ALSO AFFECTED THE AIRBAG LIGHT SIGNAL ON THE DASH. IT IS OFTEN ON AFTER THE MOTOR HAS STARTED. ALSO, IN THE RESTING POSITION, THE TURN SIGNAL ARM, THE TURN SIGNALS MAKE A FAST FLASHING LIKE NOISE, AND FOR SOME REASON, ALL THE LIGHTS TO THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE FLASH ON AND OFF CONSTANTLY. TO MAKE IT STOP, I HAVE TO RAISE OR LOWER THE TURN SIGNAL ARM ABOUT A HAIR OUT OF IT'S RESTING POSITION. I HAVE SINCE THEN TIED RUBBERBANDS AROUND THE TURN SIGNAL ARM, FROM THE ARM TO THE SIDE OF THE STEERING WHEEL COLUMN TO THE STEERING WHEEL TILT LEVER. I FEEL THAT THE ROOT OF BOTH PROBLEM IS AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE INSIDE THE STEERING WHEEL. NOTHING HAS YET BEEN DONE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM, BECAUSE IT IS A VEHICLE WITH AN AIR-BAG IN THE STEERING WHEEL. AND THAT PROCEDURE IS VERY EXPENSIVE.  *NM",
