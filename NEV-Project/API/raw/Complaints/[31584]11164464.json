I CAN PULL OVER AND TURN MY CAR OFF AND BACK ON AND IT STOPS DOING IT TIL I GET BACK UP TO THE SPEED LIMIT. I WAS TOLD BY A REPAIR SHOP THAT MY POWER STEERING WAS COVERED BY A GM RECALL, AND I CANT GET ANYONE TO FIND THE RECALL INFORMATION. MY CONCERN IS WHY IS IT JUST A FEW MAKES RECALLED IF THE ENTIRE YEAR OF THAT MAKE AND MODEL ARE FAULTY.",
