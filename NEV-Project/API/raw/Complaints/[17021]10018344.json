I HAD TO PAY $350 TO GET THE PADS REPLACED AND GET THE ROTORS REFINISHED.  I DON'T DRIVE THE CAR UNUSUALLY HARD AND DID NOT EXPECT THE BRAKES TO GO SO QUICKLY.  ALSO, THIS PAST WINTER, ALL OF THE SPARK PLUGS WERE SHOT.  THIS NOT SURPRISINGLY OCCURRED RIGHT AFTER THE WARRANTY EXPIRED.  I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS LITTLE PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR SINCE I BOUGHT IT.  I AM LEANING TOWARD NEVER LOOKING TO PURCHASE A VOLKSWAGEN AGAIN.    *JB",
