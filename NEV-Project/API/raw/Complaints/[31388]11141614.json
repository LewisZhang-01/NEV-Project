THIS IS THE ONLY MEANS OF SEEING A VEHICLE IN THE \"BLIND SPOT\", THIS IS DANGEROUS, I ONLY HAVE ONE EYE + BAD VISION, I HAVE HAD SEVERAL CLOSE CALLS. THE BACK UP ALARM ONLY SOUNDS WHEN YOU ARE 24 INCHES OR LESS FROM AN OBJECT, IF IT SOUNDS AT ALL, THE FIRST MORNING I BACKED INTO AN OBJECT, IT NEVER GAVE A SOUND. I HAVE HAD ALARMS SINCE 2004, NO PROBLEMS. BLIND SPOT MIRROWS FOR MANY YEARS. A LOT OF ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS, I HAVE BEEN WAITING OVER TWO WEEKS TO GET THIS PROBLEM FIXED. THE BLIND SPOT MIRROWS ARE A BIG SAFETY PROBLEM. MOVING & IN TRAFFIC.",
