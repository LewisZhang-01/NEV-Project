EACH TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED IT HAS BEEN FROM A STOP AND TURNING ONTO ANOTHER STREET AND OR U TURN ALL UNDER 30MPH, HAVE HAD IT TO THE DEALER 3 TIMES AND HAVE CONTACTED HYUNDAI DIRECTLY AND THEY CAN NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG. I CAN REPRODUCE THE ISSUE IF I RUN OVER PART OF THE CURB OR A HARD BUMP. I FEEL THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE IF THE SUV LOOSES POWER FOR 10-15 SECONDS WHEN PULLING OUT.",
