ONE OF THE MAIN PROBLEMS IS RUNNING ROUGH, STALLING, SLOW RESPONSE FROM A STOP, ETC. FORDS LATEST BULLETINS TO THEIR DEALERS IS THEIR IS NO FIX FOR THIS AT THE PRESENT TIME. THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT. IT IS MY BELIEVE THESE SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET UNTIL THEY RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. I AM WONDERING WHY THEY ARE STILL SELLING THESE TO THE PUBLIC AND NOT INFORMING THEM THEIR COULD BE A PROBLEM WITH THEM. I PRESENTLY OWN ONE OF THESE AND IT HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP FOR OVER 30 DAYS SINCE DEC 9TH. AT THE PRESENT TIME MY IS SO BAD I CANNOT DRIVE IT ANYMORE BECAUSE OF STALLING ON THE HIGHWAY. THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THEIR HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. ARE WE GOING TO WAIT UNTIL THERE IS A SERIOUS INJURY AND THEN TRY TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM?    TS",
