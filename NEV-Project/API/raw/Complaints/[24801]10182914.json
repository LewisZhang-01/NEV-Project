I PARKED MY CAR IN THE PARKING LOT OF THE SCHOOL AND WENT INSIDE (CAR WAS NOT ON).  I HAD ENOUGH TIME TO USE THE RESTROOM AND CHANGE MY SON'S DIAPER (10 MINUTES) AND WE GOT A PHONE CALL FROM THE MAIN OFFICE ON THE 1ST FLOOR TO TELL US THAT MY CAR WAS SMOKING.  I RAN TO THE WINDOW AND SAW BLACK SMOKE BILLOWING FROM MY HOOD.  I RAN DOWNSTAIRS TO THE 1ST FLOOR, BUT BY THE TIME I GOT NEAR ENOUGH TO SEE, I COULD SEE ORANGE FLAMES UNDERNEATH THE CAR.  I DIDN'T DARE GO NEAR THE CAR TO RETRIEVE MY BELONGINGS (PURSE, CAR SEAT, CD'S, ETC) FOR FEAR THAT THE FLAMES WOULD SPREAD TO THE GAS TANK.  BY THE TIME THE FIRE DEPARTMENT GOT THERE, THE FLAMES WERE 5-8 FEET HIGH.  THE CAR IS A TOTAL LOSS, BUT I HAVE NOT GOTTEN A QUOTE MY INSURANCE COMPANY AS OF YET. *JB",
