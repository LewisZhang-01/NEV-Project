LUCKILY, THERE WAS MINIMAL SURROUNDING TRAFFIC AT THE TIME AND WE WERE ABLE TO COAST MANEUVER THE CAR TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER BEFORE IT STALLED OUT COMPLETELY.      WE FEEL THAT ACURA BY EXTENDING THE WARRANTY WAS ACTING RESPONSIBLY.  HOWEVER, AFTER OUR HARROWING EXPERIENCE, WE STRONGLY FEEL THAT ACURA SHOULD HAVE TAKEN MORE INITIATIVE IN ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM PERHAPS BY DOING A FULL RECALL SO AS TO PREVENT SUCH LIFE-THREATENING SITUATIONS FROM OCCURRING.  IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE FOR ANYONE TO PROMISE A FIX AFTER IMPOSING LIFE AND DEATH SITUATIONS ONTO THEIR CONSUMERS.",
