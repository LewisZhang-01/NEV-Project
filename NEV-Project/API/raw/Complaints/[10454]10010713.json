THE ENGINE WILL SPUTTER, THE CAR SHAKES, THE RPMS GO TO 0 AND THE HEADER PIPE GLOWS RED HOT (LITERALLY), AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE CAR WILL LOSE 75% OF ITS POWER.  THIS IS DANGEROUS.  THIS CAR HAS MAYBE 10,000 MILES ON IT AND IT WAS BOUGHT BRAND NEW.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND NOT ACCEPTABLE.  THE SERVICE CENTER HAS REPLACED THE ROTORS (KEEP IN MIND THIS IS ON 10,000 MILES), THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER, HEAD PIPE, MUFFLER AND THE REST OF THE ENTIRE EXHAUST SYSTEM, AND SPARK PLUGS.  UP TO THIS DATE, THEY HAVE NOT FOUND THE PROBLEM AND EVEN AS I TYPE THIS, THE CAR IS SITTING IN THE SERVICE CENTER THE FOURTH TIME.  I WAS GIVEN A RENTAL VEHICLE THE THIRD TIME.  BUT THIS TIME, THEY HAVE NOT GIVEN ME A RENTAL OR REPLACEMENT VEHICLE BECAUSE TWO ARE OUT OF COMMISSION DUE TO ACCIDENTS AND ONE IS CURRENTLY BEING USED.  THEY SAY THAT THEY HAVE TO HOOK THE CAR UP TO A COMPUTER AND DRIVE IT NUMEROUS MILE TO RECORD DATA.  I JUST WANT A CAR THAT WORKS.  *JB",
