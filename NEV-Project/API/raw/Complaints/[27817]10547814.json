        "summary": "THE 2011 ROGUE IS THE CAR WE USE FOR LONGER TRIPS WHEN WE'RE NOT FLYING. ABOUT TWO HOURS INTO A LONG INTERSTATE TRIP IN MAY 2013 WE STARTED TO HEAR A HIGH PITCHED WHINE FROM THE TRANSMISSION WHENEVER WE WOULD ACCELERATE TO GO UPHILL OR PASS ANOTHER VEHICLE. SHORTLY AFTER WE STARTED HEARING THAT NOISE THE TRANSMISSION WAS UNABLE TO \"DOWNSHIFT\" (TECHNICALLY CVTS DON'T DOWNSHIFT) AND WE LOST POWER.  WE COULD STILL MAINTAIN A REASONABLE SPEED ON LEVEL TERRAIN, BUT WE WERE BARELY ABLE TO MAINTAIN SPEED GOING OVER SMALL HILLS.  WE WOULD HAVE OUR FOOT PLANTED ON THE ACCELERATOR BUT NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN, ACCELERATION WISE.  ONCE WE'D STOP, TURN THE CAR OFF, WAIT A FEW MINUTES, THEN START THE CAR AND GET BACK TO DRIVING, EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE. BUT AFTER A WHILE OF EXTENDED DRIVING THE PROBLEM WOULD RETURN.      THIS ISSUE HAS SHOWN UP A FEW TIME SINCE THEN BUT ALWAYS DURING EXTENDED DRIVING SESSIONS AND NEVER ON THE DAY-TO-DAY SHORT COMMUTES, WHICH HAS MADE IT FRUSTRATING TO TRACK.    IN DOING A SIMPLE GOOGLE SEARCH WE FOUND MANY OTHER ROGUE OWNERS DESCRIBING OUR EXACT SAME SYMPTOMS, AND EVEN SOMEONE THAT POSTED A YOUTUBE VIDEO DURING THEIR PROBLEM.
