        "summary": "MY 2006 TOYOTA SIENNA'S ACCELERATOR GETS STUCK IN THE ACCELERATION POSITION.  I WAS ENTERING THE HIGHWAY SO I WAS QUICKLY ACCELERATING TO MERGE WITH TRAFFIC AND ONCE I MERGED WITH TRAFFIC I RELEASED THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL TO ADJUST MY SPEED AND THE PEDAL REMAINED IN ACCELERATION MODE AND I WAS UNABLE TO STOP IT.  I TRIED PRESSING THE BRAKE PEDAL TO STOP OR DECREASE THE ACCELERATION AND THAT DIDN'T WORK.  I TRIED DEPRESSING THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL AGAIN TO SEE IF IT WAS STUCK AND THAT DIDN'T WORK.  EVENTUALLY THE ACCELERATION STOPPED ON ITS OWN.  THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME TWICE AND MY HUSBAND ONCE.  SO FAR THIS HAS OCCURRED THREE TIMES SINCE WE'VE HAD THE VEHICLE.  I TOOK IT INTO A TOYOTA DEALER WHERE THEY RECORDED MY ISSUE ON THE SERVICE INVOICE ON 2/17/07 AND WERE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THE ISSUE AND REMARKED THAT MY FLOOR MATS WERE UPSIDE DOWN AND THAT I SHOULD INSTALL THEM PROPERLY. *TR",
