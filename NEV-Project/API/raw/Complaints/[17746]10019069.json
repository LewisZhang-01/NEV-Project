        "summary": "I BOUGHT A 1997 FORD ESCORT WAGON NEW AND LOVE IT AND HAS ONLY 30000 MILES ON IT.  RECENTLY I HAD A PROBLEM WITH STEERING THE VEHICLE SO I HAD IT CHECKED OUT AT AN AUTO REPAIR SHOP.  THE MECHANIC TOLD ME I NEEDED NEW TIE ROD ENDS AND BOTH REAR COIL SPRINGS WERE BROKEN.  AS I DO NOT DRIVE THIS VEHICLE HARD AND DO NOT HAUL ANYTHING EXCEPT MY PUPPY AND GROCERIES, I HAD A HARD TIME BELIEVING THIS.  SO I TOOK IT TO ANOTHER GARAGE AND ANOTHER MECHANIC TOLD ME THE SAME THING AND SHOWED IT TO ME.  I AM NO LONGER DRIVING THIS VEHICLE AS IT IS UNSAFE AND THIS VEHICLE SHOULD BE PLACED ON A RECALL LIST AND FIXED BY FORD FREE OF CHARGE.  NEITHER ME OR MY HUSBAND HAVE EVER HAD THIS HAPPEN AND WE FEEL THAT DEFINITELY THIS HAS TO BE A FACTORY DEFECT.  PLEASE ADVISE ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WHAT TO DO ABOUT THIS DEFECTIVE VEHICLE SO THAT I CAN KNOW WHICH DIRECTION TO PURSUE THIS MATTER, A.E., NEWSPAPERS, TV STATIONS, ETC.  THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.  *JB",
