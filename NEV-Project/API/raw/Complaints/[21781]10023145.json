FIRST, (AT APPROX 50K) THE COOLANT LIGHT CAME ON, I TOOK IT TO FIRESTONE AND THEY HAD TO REPLACE THE WATER PUMP AND THE SERPENTINE BELT.  THE BRAKES GRIND AND I HAD THE PADS/ROTORS CHECKED AND THEY CHECK OUT OKAY?  OCCASIONALLY, THE CAR WILL SPUTTER UNDER ACCELERATION FOR NO REASON.  THE COOLANT LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN AT 71K AND NOW THE GASKET HAS TO BE REPLACED AT MY OWN COST.  FROM MY RESEARCH, GM AND PONTIAC KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEM, BUT WILL NOT ISSUE THE RECALL.  THEY CONTINUE TO POCKET THE MONEY FROM THOSE THAT ARE UNINFORMED AND FROM THOSE WHO ARE.  IF I COULD, I WOULD GET RID OF THIS CAR AND NEVER BUY A GM PRODUCT AGAIN.   *NLM",
