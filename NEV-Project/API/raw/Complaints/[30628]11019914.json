AS I TRIED TO TURN AND ACCELERATE I FOUND THE POWER STEERING WAS GONE AND THAT THE CAR WAS ROLLING. ALL THE CAR ELECTRICAL I.E. MUSIC , LIGHTS WERE ON BUT THE ENGINE WAS DEAD. I HIT THE POWER BUTTON AND THE CAR STARTED AGAIN. I WILL TAKE THIS CAR INTO DODGE AGAIN BUT I SUSPECT THAT THEY WILL TELL ME THAT THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE AND SEND ME HOME WITH IT. THIS HAPPENED LAST YEAR ALSO AND THERE HAS BEEN NO RESOLUTION.",
