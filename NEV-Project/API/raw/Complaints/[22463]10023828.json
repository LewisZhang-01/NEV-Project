THIS IS A HAZARD ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT. DUE TO THE GLARE ON THE WINDOWS INSIDE THE VAN.  I HAVE WENT TO A DEALER AND THEY SAID IT WOULD BE 400.00 DOLLARS TO FIX IT.  I DON'T HAVE 400.00.  I WAS ALSO VISITING FAMILY IN INDIANA THIS LAST WEEK AND AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE HAS THE EXACT VAN AND PROBLEM.  I CURRENTLY LIVE IN COLORADO AND THOUGHT THAT IT WAS ODD THAT SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN INDIANA HAS THE SAME PROBLEM THAT I HAVE WITH OUR WINDSTAR.  SO, THEN I DECIDED TO FILE A COMPLAINT.  AND MAYBE SOMETHING WILL BE DONE.*AK",
