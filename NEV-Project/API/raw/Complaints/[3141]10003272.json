FAILURE AT REST IS OF NO ISSUE, YOUR CAR JUST DOESN'T START OR STARTS BUT DOESN'T RUN.  HOWEVER, WHEN THE DISTRUBUTOR FAILS WHEN DRIVING IS THE ISSUE.  THE ENGINE SHUTS OFF WITHOUT WARNING, THERE IS A LOSS OF POWER STEERING AS WELL AS POWER BRAKES.  THIS IS A WELL DOCUMENTED PROBLEM AMONG MX-6 DRIVERS, AS CAN BE SEEN ON THESE SITES:  HTTP://WWW.MX6.COM  HTTP://WWW.PROBETALK.COM  HTTP://HOMEPAGE.NTLWORLD.COM/DOROTHY.BRADBURY/PROBEMX/INDEX.HTM  AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS",
