I HAVE HAD OTHER POSSIBLY RELATED ISSUES-HVAC CONTROL LIGHTS GOING OUT, HEADLIGHT ACCESSORY PANEL GOING OUT, DOOR ALARM MALFUNCTIONING, AND CIGARETTE LIGHTER INOPERABLE.  THE TRUCK HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP FOR APPROXIMATELY 56 CUMULATIVE DAYS FOR THE ABOVE LISTED ISSUES.  CANNOT DEFROST / DEFOG WINDOWS WITHOUT BLOWER MOTOR.  NO HEAT IN THE WINTER.  NO AIR-CONDITIONING IN THE SUMMER - NOT EVEN THE FAN WORKS TO CIRCULATE AIR.  AT TIMES THE PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT - LEAVING ME STRANDED WHEN ITS RAINING/SNOWING.  VEHICLE IS COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE EVEN THOUGH THE DEALERSHIP HAS \"FIXED\" IT (FOR SURE THIS TIME) 11 TIMES PRIOR TO ME DROPPING IT OFF TODAY.  *JB",
