AFTER A REPORT LAST NIGHT ON HOUSTON'S KHWB39 NEWS, I WAS VERY CONCERNED TO NOTE, THE VEHICLE IS FITTED WITH A \"GENERATION 3\" SEAT BELT SYSTEM. VISITING THE WEBSITE \"WWW.UNSAFEBELTS.COM\", I SEE  THIS BELT/LATCH DESIGN HAS BEEN SHOWN TO FAIL ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS. SPECIFICALLY, I READ THAT A CHRYSLER ENGINEER TESTIFIED THAT CHRYSLER WAS AWARE OF FOUR OR FIVE CRASH TESTS WHERE GENERATION 3 BUCKLES ACCIDENTALLY UNLATCHED. THIS CONCERNS ME GREATLY. WE HAVE A YOUNG DAUGHTER WHO TRAVELS IN A CHILD SEAT, AND THIS IS A SPECIFIC CONCERN BASED ON REPORTS OF THESE SEATS CAUSING THE BUCKLE TO UNLATCH. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY, WHEN THE MANUFACTURER IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE. I ACCEPT  THIS WILL HAVE SERIOUS FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THEM, BUT THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE FUNCTIONING SAFETY EQUIPMENT IN THEIR VEHICLES.  *JB",
