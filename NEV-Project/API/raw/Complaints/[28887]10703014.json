I HAD BEEN DRIVING ON SR 20 WHICH GOES FROM 55MPH TO 35 MPH AND FROM TWO LANES TO ONE.I AM APPROACHING A LIGHT I HAVE MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE WHEN SUDDENLY MY CAR ACCELERATED AS IF I HAD FLOORED IT, HITTING  A PICKUP TRUCK IN FRONT OF ME. UPON IMPACT IT MOVED FORWARD AND THEN WITH MY FOOT STILL ON THE BRAKE I HIT IT AGAIN. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW FAST I WAS GOING BUT FOR THAT BRIEF TIME I FELT AS IF I WAS IN A ROCKET. I PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND AT THIS POINT  REGAINED CONTROL AND WAS ABLE TO PULL TO SIDE OF ROAD. NO DAMAGE TO THE TRUCK. MY FRONT BUMPER NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AS WELL AS BENT LICENSE PLATE. AIR BAG DID NOT DEPLOY. THE CAR WAS PUT ON A FLATBED AND BROUGHT BACK TO OUR RESIDENCE SOME 50 MILES AWAY. NEITHER OF US ARE THRILLED ABOUT GETTING BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THIS CAR AGAIN AND SO IT SITS IN OUR GARAGE.OUR PLANS ARE TO GET RID OF THIS CAR EVEN THOUGH WE LOVED IT UP UNTIL THIS POINT.    MY HUSBAND CALLED THE DEALERSHIP YESTERDAY ( 3/30/15)  AND THEY REFERRED HIM TO TOYOTA USA. HE SPOKE WITH SOMEONE THERE AND WAS GIVEN A CASE NUMBER HE WAS TOLD HE WOULD RECEIVE A CALL WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. WELL THAT CAME AND WENT AND WHEN HE CALLED BACK TODAY HE WAS TOLD THE PERSON WHO WAS HANDLING THIS WAS GONE FOR THE DAY HE WAS TOLD SHE ATTEMPTED TO REACH US TWICE. STRANGE SHE NEVER LEFT A MESSAGE. WE ARE AT THIS TIME WAITING FOR RESPONSE.  *TR",
