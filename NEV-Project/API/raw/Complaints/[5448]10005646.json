        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING CAR, THE SUNROOF GLASS SUDDENLY CRACKED UPWARD AND THEN SHATTERED.  IT HAD NEVER BEEN HIT BY ANYTHING EITHER FROM ABOVE OR BELOW.  THE SUNSHADE WAS OPEN AT THE TIME, BUT THE SUNROOF GLASS WAS NOT RETRACTED AT ALL.  THE GLASS WAS NOT CRACKED, PITTED OR DAMAGED IN ANY OTHER WAY BEFORE CRACKING AND SHATTERING.  ALTHOUGH THE GLASS WAS HELD TOGETHER FOR THE MOST PART BY THE OUTSIDE SUNFILM, THE SUNFILM WAS CRACKED IN SEVERAL PLACES, AND SMALL SHARDS OF GLASS SPRAYED THROUGHOUT THE PASSENGER CABIN.  FORTUNATELY, I WAS THE ONLY OCCUPANT OF THE CAR AT THE TIME AND WAS NOT INJURED, BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE AS THE SHATTERED GLASS COULD HAVE INJURED MY EYES.  TO PREVENT MORE GLASS FROM COMING INTO THE CABIN, I CLOSED THE INTERIOR SUNSHADE AND EVENTUALLY PUT PLASTIC OVER THE SUNROOF TO PREVENT MOISTURE FROM COMING INTO THE CAR.  I WENT TO THE DEALER THE SAME DAY TO ARRANGE FOR REPAIR.  THE SERVICE MANAGER CALLED THE LOCAL DAIMLERCHRYSLER REP TO SEE IF CHRYSLER WOULD REPLACE THE GLASS UNDER WARRANTY.  THE LOCAL REP TOLD THE SERVICE MANAGER THAT DAIMLERCHRYSLER WOULD NOT WARRANTY THE GLASS AND REFERRED ME TO MY CAR INSURER.  HE NEVER SAW THE CAR.  I HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS DEFECT MYSELF.  I CHECKED THE WARRANTY SUPPLIED WITH THE CAR AND FOUND NO EXCLUSION FOR GLASS OR FOR DEFECTS IN THE SUNROOF.  I HAVE CHECKED AND FOUND THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD EXACTLY THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE SAME RESPONSE FROM DAIMLERCHRYSLER.  TO ME, THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  AS TROUBLING AS IT IS THAT THE SUNROOF BROKE AND THAT DAIMLERCHRYSLER WILL DO NOTHING, IT IS EVEN SCARIER THAT THE SAFETY GLASS SHATTERED, SCATTERING INJURY-CAUSING SHARDS OF GLASS, NOT THE USUAL PEBBLES, THROUGHOUT THE PASSENGER CABIN.  SAFETY GLASS IS SUPPOSED TO BE EXACTLY THAT - SAFE.  THIS SUNROOF AND THE GLASS IT IS MADE OF ARE NOT.",
