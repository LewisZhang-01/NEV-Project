EVEN WHEN THEY DO TURN ON THEY TURN OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF USE.  THIS HAS BECOME A GREAT HASSLE FOR ME, BECAUSE WHEN THEY DO NOT TURN ON WHEN IT IS RAINING MY VISIBILITY IS VERY RESTRICTED.  THIS HAS BEEN VERY DANGEROUS, FOR EXAMPLE, ONE TIME I WAS DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AND IT WAS POURING DOWN RAIN AND MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS STOPPED WORKING, AND I COULD HARDLY SEE THE ROAD IN FRONT OF ME.",
