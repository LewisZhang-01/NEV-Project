THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE BOTTOM OF THE FLOOR AND THE LEAF IS ONE AND ONE HALF INCHES. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE RUBBER BUMPER AND THE AXLE IS OVER THREE INCHES. THE LEAF SPRING AND BRAKE CABLE CANNOT TAKE THE DAMAGE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME. WE HAVE TO REMOVE THE SPARE AND REAR SEATS TO DRIVE SOMEWHAT SAFER. CONTACT WITH THE COMPANY WAS FUTILE.",
