WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 68 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY, THE CHECK ENGINE WARNING INDICATOR ILLUMINATED,  SERVICE STABILTRACK AND REDUCED ENGINE POWER WARNING ALL CAME ON AT ONCE CAUSING THE TRUCK TO REDUCE SPEED QUICKLY AND DANGEROUSLY ON THE HIGHWAY.  I WAS ALMOST REAR ENDED AS THE MY SPEED WENT FROM 68 MPH TO LESS THAN 30 MPH IN AN INSTANT.  THANKFULLY THE GENTLEMAN WAS ABLE TO SLOW IN TIME- THROUGH ON HIS HAZARDS AND HELP ESCORT ME TO THE EMERGENCY SHOULDER.  MY TRUCK HAS APPROXIMATELY 67,000 MILE ON IT AND THIS PROBLEM HAS NOW HAPPENED 5 TIMES AT VARIOUS SPEEDS.  I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS MATTER AND THIS IS KNOW ISSUE AND IS ALL OVER THE GM FORUMS WITH MULTIPLE MODELS.  EACH FIX REPORTED COMES AFTER CUSTOMERS HAVE SPENT HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS FOR THE DEALERS TO LOCATE THE ISSUES.  GM/CHEVY ARE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND YET THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE EVEN THOUGH IT IS CAUSED FROM A KNOWN DEFECTIVE PART AND CAUSES A DANGEROUS DRIVING SITUATION!",
