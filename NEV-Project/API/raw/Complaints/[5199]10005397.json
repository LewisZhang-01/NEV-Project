THE DEALERSHIP SAYS IN ORDER FOR THE REPAIR TO BE COVERED W/THE EXTENDED WARRANTY THE NAME HAS TO BE CHANGED FROM THE ORIGINAL OWNER.  MY TRUCK HAS BEEN SITTING AT THE DEALERSHIP NOW GOING ON 6 WEEKS.  I'M REALLY GETTING THE RUNAROOUND FROM THESE PEOPLE AND IT'S UNACCEPTABLE.  THE WARRRANTY WAS PURCHASED WITH THE TRUCK AND IT SHOULD STAY WITH THE TRUCK...  PRIOR TO ALL OF THIS I HAD A 5 DOLLAR CENSOR GO OUT WHICH WAS COVERED BY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY AND I RE'CD A LETTER OF NOTIFICATION OF THE REPAIR UNDER EXTENDED WARRANTY WITH MY NAME ON THE FORM..  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND NOW THAT THE REPAIR IS MAJOR THEY ARE REFUSING TO REPAIR?  IT'S NOT RIGHT TO ME THE CONSUMER AND IT'S TOTALLY UNACCEPTIBLE...",
