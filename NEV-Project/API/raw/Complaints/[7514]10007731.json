I HAVE WENT THRU THREE SETS OF PADS AND IT HAS MADE A GRRINDING NOISE AFTER ABOUT TWO MONTHS OF OWNERSHIP. THE ABS LIGHT IS KNOW STARTING TO COME ON AND THIS CAR IS THE ONE MY WIFE USES ON A DAILY BASIS AND I AM WORRIED THAT DUE TO THE FREQUENCY OF BARKE PROBLEMS IT IS NOT SAFE FOR HER TO DRIVE. THE CAR ONLY HAS 41,000 MILES AND PARTLY DUE TO WE DO NOT TRUST THE VEHICLE AND DUE TO THE LOW BOOK VALUE OF THE CAR WE WILL LOSE IF WE TRY TO TRADE BUT ARE PUT INTO A PSOTION TO FOR KNOW HOLD ON TO IT.",
