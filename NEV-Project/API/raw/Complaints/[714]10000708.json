WHILE STILL UNDER WARRANTY, I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID ALL THE NEW 4 CYLINDER TRUCKS WERE LIKE THIS.  AT 12000 MILES, THE VALVES ARE TAPPING AT IDLE, AND THE HOOD VIBRATES.  SEEING THE OTHER COMPLAINTS ON THIS FORUM, I NOW REMEMBER HOW SQUIRLY THE TRUCK GETS AFTER GOING OVER BUMPS.  THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE BAD FRONT SHOCKS.  I HOPE I DON'T GET INTO A BAD ACCIDENT KNOWING THE AIR BAGS ARE NOT GOING TO WORK.",
