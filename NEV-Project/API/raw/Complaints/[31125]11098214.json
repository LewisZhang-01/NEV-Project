EACH TIME I'VE HAD TO CALL A SERVICE FOR A JUMP AND HAVE TAKEN IT TO A LOCAL AUTO PARTS STORE WHERE TESTS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED ON THE BATTERY, ALTERNATOR AND STARTER ... NOTHING FOUND WRONG EACH TIME.  THE LAST TIME THE CAR WOULDN'T START, I HAVE PUSH BUTTON START.  EVEN THOUGH THE BATTERY WAS DEAD, THE PUSH BUTTON WAS STUCK IN THE 'CAR RUNNING' POSITION, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO BE JUMP STARTED.  THE CAR DEALERSHIP HAD NO CLUE WHY THIS HAPPENED OR IF IT WOULD HAPPEN AGAIN.",
