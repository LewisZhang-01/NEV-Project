        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE STREET AT ABOUT 35 MPH WHEN THE BATTERY ICON FLASHED ON. THE AIR CONDITIONER AND THE RADIO CUTOFF FOLLOWING THE DISPLAY OF THE BATTERY ICON. A FEW SECONDS LATER THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT ALONG WITH A LOSS OF POWER. A MESSAGE DISPLAYED ON THE DASHBOARD TELLING ME TO PULL OVER IMMEDIATELY ALONG WITH A SERVICE TRANS BRAKE MESSAGE AND A FEW OTHERS THAT I CAN'T RECALL. I TRIED TO GET TO A SAFE LOCATION BUT THE VEHICLE SHIFTED INTO PARK AND COMPLETELY TURNED OFF WHEN I WAS GOING LESS THAN 5 MPH. CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO BE STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD WITH TRAFFIC TRYING TO GET BY. I SLOWED DOWN BECAUSE THERE WERE VEHICLES IN FRONT OF ME MAKING TURNS. THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED. TOWED VEHICLE TO DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THE ALTERNATOR BURNED UP. THE BATTERY IS DAMAGED AS WELL. THIS SOUNDS SIMILAR TO THE TWO RECALLS NAMED \"ALTERNATOR MAY FAIL RESULTING IN ENGINE STALL\". NOTIFIED THE DEALERSHIP AND JEEP CUSTOMER CARE ABOUT THIS AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY CAN FIX THIS RECALL BECAUSE MY VIN  IS NOT PART OF THE RECALL. VEHICLE IS OUT OF WARRANTY SO THEY SAY THE REPAIRS WILL COME OUT OF MY POCKET. AFTER THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED ABOUT A YEAR AGO I REFUSE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE ON THE HIGHWAY BECAUSE OF THE SUDDEN SHUTOFF AND LOSS OF STEERING. I FEEL THIS COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT AND I REFUSE TO TAKE THAT RISK.",
