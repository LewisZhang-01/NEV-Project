I'M GLAD I DIDN'T HAVE THE KIDS IN THE CAR WITH ME.  THE CAR ONLY HAS 90,000 MILES AND WAS SERVICED AND MAINTAINED PROPERLY. TRANSMISSION HAS TO BE COMPLETELY REPLACED COSTING TOTAL $5,000.00. HONDA MOTOR CO. WAS ONLY WILLING TO PAY 50% OF THE COST. THEY SHOULD PAY THE ENTIRE COST SINCE IT IS A DEFECTIVE PART. THEY ADMIT THEY ARE AT FAULT BY SENDING RECALLS IN 2004 ON THE TRANSMISSION AND NOW PAYING 50% OF THE TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT.  *TR",
