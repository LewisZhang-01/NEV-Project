THE CRACK HAS EITHER REOPENED OR A NEW CRACK HAS DEVELOPED.  LOCAL MECHANIC REPORTS THAT THE HEAD GASKET HAS ALSO FAILED. I JUST THOUGHT THAT THIS SHOULD BE NOTED IN YOUR FILES, SINCE I AM SURE OTHER OWNERS ARE SEEING SAME PROBLEMS. A CO-WORKER HAS THE SAME YEAR DODGE STRATUS WITH SAME ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION, HE HAS SAME PROBLEM- HIS WAS FIXED AT SAME TIME MY CARAVAN WAS BY THE SAME DEALER WITH SAME PUTTY. HE HAS SINCE TRADED HIS VEHICLE OFF. THANK YOU. *TS *JB  ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12-12-02 CUT OVER TO ARTEMIS***762668",
