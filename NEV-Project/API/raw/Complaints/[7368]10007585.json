THE FIRST CAR BEHIND, AND ALL OTHERS IN SAME LANE  MANAGED TO STOP AFTER BURNING SOME RUBBER . THE  OTHER SEVEN LANES ON MY RIGHT AND LEFT CONTINUED REGULAR SPEED IN  EXCESS OF 80 MILES  AN HOUR.  A CONSIDERABLE TIME LATER, SOMEONE MANAGED TO STOP THE RIGHT LANE TRAFFIC , AND WITH THE HELP OF FEW SARMARITANS,  THEY  PUSHED MY CAR TO RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD.   AFTER  THE SHOCK OF THE POSSIBILTY OF  GETTING HIT, AND WAITING OVER 2 HOURS FOR A WRECKER SERVICE TO TAKE ME TO RBM OF ATLANTA, I FELT I WAS MOST LUCKY TO BE ALIVE TODAY.
