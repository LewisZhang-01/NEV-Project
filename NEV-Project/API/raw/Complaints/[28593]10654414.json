        "summary": "WHILE TRAVELING ON THE HIGHWAY THE HUB CAP ON THE DRIVER?S SIDE REAR WHEEL CAME OFF. THE TRUCK HAD A LITTLE OVER 3000 MILES ON IT. I WAS DRIVING NORMALLY AND DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE WHEN THE HUB CAP CAME OFF. I ONLY NOTICED IT WAS MISSING WHEN I REACHED MY DESTINATION. I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO WORK WITH THE DEALER AND FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE. BOTH THE DEALER AND FORD MOTOR CORPORATION REFUSE TO SEE THIS AS A DEFECTIVE PART AND REFUSE TO WARRANTY THESE PARTS. I CAN REMOVE THE REMAINING HUB CAPS FROM MY TRUCK EASILY USING MY BARE HANDS. I HAVE MADE A VIDEO OF THIS HTTP://YOUTU.BE/7WPG9XSVYOG. I HAVE ALSO DEMONSTRATED THIS TO THE SERVICE MANAGER AT BLUEBONNET MOTORS OF SAN ANTONIO. THIS IS A DANGEROUS ROAD HAZARD AS THESE DEFECTIVE HUB CAPS CAN COME OFF AT ANY POINT ON THE ROAD AND CAUSE AN ACCIDENT BY HITTING OTHER MOTORISTS OR SWERVING TRYING TO AVOID IT. FORD REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS.",
