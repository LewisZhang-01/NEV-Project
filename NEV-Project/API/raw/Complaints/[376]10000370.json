I POPPED THE HOOD TO FIND THAT ALL OF THE ENGINE BELTS HAD BEEN THROWN.  AFTER TWO DAYS AT THE DEALERSHIP, I WAS ADVISED THE CRANK BOLT (KEY WAY AND CRANKSHAFT PULLEY) HAD FAILED.  THE HONDA DEALERSHIP (DON CARLTON, TULSA, OK) COULD OFFER NO EXPLANATION AS TO WHY IT HAPPENED, ONLY THAT I WAS OUT OF WARRANTY.  MY REPAIR BILL WAS $536.61.  I ALSO INCURRED A $57.34 TOW BILL TO GET THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP.",
