        "summary": "I HAVE A 2000 MERCURY COUGAR THAT ONCE WARMED UP ACCELERATES 3000 TO 3500 RPM AND WILL NOT SLOW DOWN UNTIL I COME TO A DEAD STOP. I  HAD IT IN FOR THIS PROBLEM AT LEAST 6 TIMES AND THEY CAN'T FIX IT.  I CALLED THE FORD/MERCURY SERVICE HOT LINE TO SEE IF SOMETHING COULD BE DONE ABOUT THIS.  WHEN I CALLED ABOUT THIS I THOUGHT THAT A MERCURY REP. WOULD GET A HOLD OF THE CAR DEALERSHIP WERE I GOT THE  CAR (JOHNSON FORD LINCOLN/ MERCURY IN PITTSFIELD, MA) AND THEN GET A HOLD OF ME. I CALLED IN JAN. THATS NOT WHAT HAPPENED, WHEN I CALLED I FOUND OUT THAT JOHNSON FORD TOLD THEM, THEY DID NOT EXPERIENCE THE PROBLEM. THAT'S AN OUT RIGHT LIE. DOM KELLOG HEAD OF JOHNSON SERVICE DROVE IT AND EXPERIENCED IT AND ON ANOTHER TIME ONE OF THE MECHANICS RIDING WITH ME ALSO EXPERIENCED IT. WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT THIS. I CAN'T LET ANYBODY DRIVE MY CAR, I AM AFRAID THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE HANDLE IT AN GET SERIOUSLY HURT. I DON'T WANT TO WAIT UNTIL I GET KILLED OR SOME ONE ELSE BEFORE THEY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU OR I CAN DO ABOUT THIS. I AM GOING TO PUT DOWN AN ESTIMATE THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED WHICH WAS ABOUT 10000 MILE MARK THE CAR NOW HAS ABOUT 23000 MILES ON IT.  *JB",
