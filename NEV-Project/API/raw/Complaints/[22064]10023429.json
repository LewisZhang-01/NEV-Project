MY BRAKES ARE WARPING UNDER NORMAL DRIVING CONDITIONS AND HAVE BEEN TURNED ONCE, ONLY TO HAVE THE PROBLEM RETURN IN DAYS. NOW I MUST HAVE NEW ROTORS INSTALLED EVEN THOUGH MY BRAKE PADS ARE VIRTUALLY NEW. SINCE I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE USED, THE USED CAR WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER THIS PROBLEM. TOYOTA IS VERY AWARE OF THIS ISSUE BUT YET REFUSE TO CORRECT IT. I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE MADE TO RECTIFY THIS PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE GET SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED.   *NLM",
