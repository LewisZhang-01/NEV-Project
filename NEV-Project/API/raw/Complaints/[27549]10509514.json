I WILL BE DRIVING, THE SPEED DOES NOT MATTER, SOMETIMES IT IS 30, 50, OR 80 MPH, AND THE CAR WILL JUST START LOSING POWER. FIRST THE DASH AND ALL MY GAUGES WILL GO OUT, THEN THE MOTOR WILL START TO SOUND FUNNY AND START LOSING POWER. THEN AS I MAKE IT TO THE SIDE (THANKFULLY EVERY TIME) IT JUST STOPS RUNNING AND EVERYTHING SHUTS OFF. I TRY TO RE-CRANK IT AND IT WON'T TURN OVER. I WILL TURN MY FLASHERS ON AND EVEN THEN THEY RUN AT AN EXTREMELY REDUCED RATE AND SOMETIMES NOT AT ALL. I HAVE REPLACED MY BATTERY, THE WIRING TO MY ALTERNATOR, MY ALTERNATOR, AND MY EGR VALVE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO FIX AND I NEED THE PROBLEM DIAGNOSED SO I'M NOT SPENDING MONEY FIXING THINGS I DON'T NEED AND SPEND MONEY ON THE ACTUAL ISSUE GETTING FIXED.  *TR",
