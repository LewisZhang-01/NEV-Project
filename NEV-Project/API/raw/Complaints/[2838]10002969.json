        "summary": "I OWN A VOLKSWAGON PASSAT 2002 1.8 TURBO MODEL..  THE COILS ON THE ENGINE ARE DEFECTIVE.  VOLKSWAGON KNOW THIS AND HAS IMPROVED THE COIL AND REPLACES IT WITH A NEW DESIGN.  I HAVE A 4 CYLINDER ENGINE.  THAT MEANS I HAVE ONE COIL ON EACH CYLINDER.  I HAVE 3 COILS GO BAD.  WHEN THEY GO BAD WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING YOU LOSE POWER TO THE CAR AND ARE UNABLE TO DRIVE AT YOUR CURRENT SPEED.  I HAD ONE COIL GO BAD IN NOVEMBER OF 2002, DECEMBER OF 2002, AND TODAY MY 3RD COIL WENT BAD.  I HAVE FILED A COMPLIANT WITH VOLKSWAGON BUT THEY WON'T REPLACE ALL THE COILS UNTIL THEY BREAK.  I HAVE ONLY ONE MORE TO FIX BUT THEY WON'T FIX IT.  IT IS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE THE CAR OR TO TAKE LONG TRIPS WITH THE CAR DUE TO THE FACT YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THE COIL WILL BREAK.  I FILED A COMPLIANT OVER THE PHONE FOR THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION IN DECEMBER.  I WAS SUPPOSED TO RECIEVE INFORMATION FROM YOU TO FILL OUT AND RETURN.. I CALLED TWICE AND HAVE NEVER RECIEVED IT.  MY CAR BROKE DOWN TODAY FOR THE THIRD TIME.  THE DEALERSHIP IS CLOSED AND I HAD TO RENT A CAR AGAIN.  COULD SOMEONE INVESTIGATE THIS.  I CAN NOT BE THE ONLY PERSON IN AMERICA WITH THIS PROBLEM.",
