        "summary": "ON OR ABOUT FEBRUARY 06, 2019, OUR 2007 VOLVO XC-90 EXPERIENCED A STEERING LOCK FAILURE.  THAT IS THE LOCK COULD NOT ADVANCE TO THE START POSITION AND CONSEQUENTLY LOCKED THE KEY IN THE IGNITION SWITCH.    THE LOCK WOULD NOT ADVANCE.  CONSEQUENTLY PERFORMED THE FOLLOWING:  A) CONSULTED VOLVO OWNER'S MANUAL.  THE MANUAL WAS SILENT ON THIS.  SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED NOSE FIRST IN OUR GARAGE, AGAIN CONSULTED THE VOLVO OWNER'S MANUAL TO FIND OUT HOW TO MANUALLY GET THE VOLVO OUT OF PARK.  VOLVO'S MANUAL WAS SILENT ON THIS.  B)CONTACTED NORTH TOWN VOLVO DEALER FOR ADVICE.  RESPONSE WAS TO GET THE VEHICLE IN BY TOWING.  NO ADVICE AS TO HOW TO DISENGAGE THE VOLVO'S PARK FEATURE.  C)CONTACTED VOLVO'S ON LINE CHAT SERVICE AND RECEIVED THE SAME RESPONSE.  NO HELP!  GET THE CAR TOWED IN!  D)CONTACTED IN COLLISION AND AUTO REPAIR.  THEY SUGGESTED A 2006 YOU TUBE VIDEO SHOWING HOW TO DISENGAGE THE PARK FUNCTION.  THIS WORKED AND THE VOLVO 2007 XC-90  WAS TOWED TO IN COLLISION AND AUTO REPAIR.   IT TOOK THREE WEEKS TO REPAIR THE LOCK FOR THE PARTS HAD TO COME FROM GERMANY.  PICTURES OF THE FAILED LOCK ASSEMBLY ARE ENCLOSED.  AFTER THE LOCK REPAIR, IN COLLISION PERFORMED THE FOLLOWING:  A)REPLACED RADIATOR:  THE RADIATOR HAD A SMALL LEAK SINCE THE GET-GO.  BROUGHT THE VOLVO IN SEVERAL TIMES TO NORTH TOWN VOLVO AND THEY COULD NOT FIND IT.  DURING A VISIT TO THEM THE COOLANT WAS TOPPED OFF AT NO CHARGE AND I APPARENTLY OBSERVED, BUT IT WAS DENIED BY THE SERVICE ADVISOR, THE SERVICE ADVISOR DROPPING SOMETHING INTO THE COOLANT EXPANSION TANK.  COMPARED TO THE NEW COOLANT AFTER RADIATOR REPLACEMENT, IT IS MUCH CLEARER WITHOUT THE DARKEN FLAKEY CONSISTENCY OF THE PREVIOUS COOLANT OF WHICH WAS LIKE THAT SINCE THE GET-GO.    B)REPLACED HVAC BLOWER MOTOR DUE TO FAILURE.  C)CLEANED UP DRIVER SIDE DOOR SECURITY CONTACTS SO THAT THE POWER DOOR LOCKS LOCK WHEN THE ALARM IS TOGGLED.",
