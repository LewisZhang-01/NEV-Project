I SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON JUST TIRES. TO TOP IT OFF I CAN'T GET THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT OFF BECAUSE OF THE BCM AND A LEAK SOMEWHERE. I WENT THROUGH ALL THE PROCEDURE I BROUGHT A NEW GAS CAP, I BROUGHT A NEW SENSOR, I CHECKED THE WIRES NO HOLES AND NOTHING HAS WORKED. I STILL HAVE TWO CODES ON MY VEHICLE STILL AFTER SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY TO GET IT OFF",
