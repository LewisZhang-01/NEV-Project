HOWEVER, THIS PAST MONDAY (8/30/2010), WHEN I WAS STOPPED AT A STOP LIGHT I HEARD A SOFT CRACK. I PROCEEDED THROUGH THE INTERSECTION WHERE SHIFTING FROM 2 TO 3RD I HEARD AN EVEN LARGER SNAP AND THE PEDAL DEPRESSED COMPLETELY TO THE FLOOR AND I HAD TO CUT ACROSS A FEW LANES OF TRAFFIC AND SAFELY MANAGED TO GET TO A GAS STATION. THE CAR WAS NO LONGER ABLE TO CHANGE GEARS AND THE ENTIRE CLUTCH PEDAL ASSEMBLY HAD TO BE REPLACED. *TR",
