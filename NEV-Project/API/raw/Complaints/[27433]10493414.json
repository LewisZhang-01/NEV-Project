        "summary": "MY 2002 JEEP LIBERTY WAS BOUGHT BRAND NEW FROM THE DEALER. ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE DASHBOARD TURNED OFF AND THEN TURNED BACK ON, THEN MY CAR STARTED SHAKING LIKE IT WAS ABOUT TO STALL, AND THE ENGINE LIGHT STARTED TO BLINK. I GOT SCARED BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT MY ENGINE TO STALL AND BREAK DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY SINCE IT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS, SO I GOT OFF THE HIGHWAY AND PARKED IT IN A LOT OVER NIGHT SO THAT I COULD TAKE IT STRAIGHT TO THE DEALER THE NEXT DAY. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER VERY CAREFULLY, MY CAR STARTED OVER HEATING WHEN IT WAS SITTING IN PLACE/ TRAFFIC FOR MORE THAN ONE MINUTE, AND THEN IT WOULD COOL BACK DOWN WHEN IT WAS MOVING. FINALLY AT THE DEALER THEY CHANGED THE WATER PUMP, THERMOSTAT, AND ONE OF THE COILS. THE DEALERSHIP SAID THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED AND SENT ME OFF. WITHIN THAT WEEK MY CAR STARTED ACTING UP AGAIN, THE ENGINE LIGHT BEGAN TO FLASH AGAIN AND I NOTICED MY CAR WAS STILL BEING JUMPY. I TOOK IT BACK AND IT TURNS OUT IT HAD BLOWN HEAD GASKETS, NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE HEADS WERE NOT EVEN REPAIRABLE. I NEED A COMPLETE NEW ENGINE. I LOOKED ONLINE AND HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS VERY COMMON FOR JEEP LIBERTY'S TO HAVE A MAJOR ENGINE PROBLEM. THERE IS OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE WAY JEEP BUILDS THEIR ENGINES. THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL, IT IS A DEFECT IN THE LIBERTY'S. THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS OF JEEP ENGINES BREAKING DOWN WITH NO SIGNS. ALSO AS A SIDE NOTE, THE SEAT BELT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE DOESN'T REALLY CLICK AND SOMETIMES UN BUCKLES ON ITS OWN. THERE IS ALSO AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM, THE INSIDE LIGHTS TURN OFF AND ON ALL THE TIME BY THEMSELVES. *TR",
