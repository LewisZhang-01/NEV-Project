        "summary": "TEST DROVE A USED 1999 MITSUBISHI DIAMANTE VIN # [XXX] AT THE WAYZATA AUTO CENTER BARGAIN LOT 1805 EAST WAYZATA BLVD., WAYZATA, MN 55391ON OR ABOUT 12/26/02. THE CAR WAS SHOWING APPROX 57,000 MILES. WHILE MY WIFE WAS DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEED SHE MADE A LANE CHANGE AND THE CAR ENTERED INTO AN OSCILLATION WHICH CAUSED ME TO QUESTION HER DRIVING AND THEN DRIVE THE CAR MYSELF. I REPEATED THE EXERCISE AND NOTICED THE VEHICLE HAD A TENDENCY TO ENTER INTO A PRONOUNCED OSCILLATION ANY TIME A TURN WAS ATTEMPTED AT CRUISE SPEED. WE IMMEDIATELY RETURNED TO THE DEALER AND POINTED OUT WHAT I CONSIDERED TO BE A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE TO THE SALESMAN ([XXX] . I LATER WROTE AN EMAIL TO [XXX]  AT THE VILLAGE CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP WHO ORIGINALLY ADVERTISED THE CAR IN TRADERONLINE. I HAVE YET TO GET A RESPONSE STATING THEY LOOKED INTO THE ISSUE. BY THE WAY, I'M A QA AUDITOR, MECHANIC AND PILOT, COMFORTABLE WITH THE PERSONALITY QUIRKS OF MOST VEHICLES. WHILE BOTHERSOME AND A DEAL KILLER FOR US, I FEEL THIS ISSUE WOULD BE A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR INEXPERIENCE DRIVERS IN LESS THAN IDEAL ROAD CONDITIONS. I HAVE YET TO GET A RESPONSE FROM THE DEALERSHIP SAYING THEY EITHER INVESTIGATED OR TOOK ACTION ON THE PROBLEM.
