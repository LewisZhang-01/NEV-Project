SHE REALIZED THAT IT WAS STILL IN DRIVE AND SHIFTED TO PARK AND RESTARTED THE CAR.  THE CAR ROLLED OUT OF THE GARAGE WHILE STILL IN PARK.  MY DAUGHTER ATTEMPTED TO EXIT THE CAR, WAS KNOCKED DOWN AND RAN OVER BY THE RUNAWAY VEHICLE.  SHE WAS INJURED BY THIS ACCIDENT.  THE CAR HIT A TREE ACROSS THE STREET FROM MY HOUSE.  I FOUND A SPRING IN THE GARAGE FLOOR THAT I THOUGHT BELONG TO THE CAR.  I CONTACTED AMERICA HONDA AND TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER.  THEY WERE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE THIS INCIDENT.  THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR.  I RESEARCHED ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND OTHER SIMILAR INCIDENTS INVOLVING THE 2016 TO 2018 HONDA CIVIC.  I MADE HONDA AWARE THAT THERE WAS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FOR THIS SAME ISSUE ON THE INTERNET.  THE ROLLING BACK IN PARK ISSUE HAD HAPPENED TWICE BEFORE TO ME.",
