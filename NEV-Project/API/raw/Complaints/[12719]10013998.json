        "summary": "POPPING NOISE AND CLINKING FELT IN STEERING AND EXCESSIVE PLAY.  IT IS HARDER TO TURN TO THE RIGHT-LITERALLY YOU FEEL THE WHEEL GOING AROUND MUCH FURTHER THAN IF TURNING TO THE LEFT, ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT NEED AN ALIGNMENT. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER WHERE THEY REPLACED THE BUSHINGS AND FIXED LOWER CLEARANCE ARMS (WHICH HAD EXCESSIVE CLEARANCE). PICKED IT UP AND FELT THE SAME CLINKING AND HEARD THE NOISE AGAIN!! I RETURNED IT AND THE SERVICE MANAGER TOOK A TEST DRIVE-HE ONLY HAD TO TURN OUT OF THE PARKING LOT AND HE KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG. THEY REPLACED THE STEERING SHAFT. AFTER DRIVING FOR A FEW DAYS, I ONCE AGAIN FELT THE SAME SENSATION AND NOISE-NOT AS BAD AS BEFORE BUT STILL THERE. STEERING HAS A LOT OF PLAY IN IT-I CAN ROCK IT BACK AND FORTH AND IT DOESN'T MOVE THE VEHICLE. IF YOU GO OVER ANY BUMP IN THE ROAD YOU FEEL THE CLINKING IN THE STEERING. IT HAS ONCE AGAIN BEEN TAKEN TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIRS. I ALSO HAVE PROBLEMS STOPPING AT AROUND 20-30 MILES PER HOUR, ESPECIALLY OVER BUMPS-IT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE IT WILL STOP-BRAKE PEDAL SEEMS TO GO TO THE FLOOR-I HAVE TO RELEASE IT AND PRESS AGAIN-I HAVE HAD SEVERAL CLOSE CALLS. I REPORTED THIS AND THE SERVICE DEPT. TOLD ME THIS IS HOW ABS WORKS-I DON'T THINK SO. THERE ARE TOO MANY COMPLAINTS ON THIS SITE OF THE SAME PROBLEM. THIS VEHICLE HAS 10,000 MILES ON IT.   *JB",
