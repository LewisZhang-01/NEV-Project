        "summary": "I AM WRITING IN RESPONSE TO A REPORT THAT WAS FEATURED ON THE NEWS ON 4/27/03 CONCERNING  THE GEN 3 SEAT BELTS ON CHRYSLER AND DODGE VEHICLES.  I WAS VERY ALARMED AT THE INFORMATION THAT THESE SEAT BELTS CAN EASILY BECOME UNLATCHED WITH MINIMAL PRESSURE SUCH AS AN ELBOW OR DRINK CONTAINER.  THE REPORT ALSO SHOWED THE \"BALL TEST\"  WHICH EASILY DISENGAGED THE SEAT BELT.  THERE WERE SEVERAL OWNERS OF VEHICLES FEATURED, INCLUDING A WOMAN WHO LOST HER HUSBAND IN AN ACCIDENT WHEN HIS GEN 3 SEAT BELT UNLATCHED DURING AN ACCIDENT AND HE WAS THROWN 30 FEET.  CHRYSLER HAS INSISTED THAT THE SEAT BELT MEETS ALL SAFETY STANDARDS, HOWEVER IT WAS REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE CHANGED THE SEAT BELTS IN SOME OF THEIR NEWER MODEL CARS, INCLUDING THE FRONT SEAT, BUT NOT THE REAR SEAT OF THE CARAVAN,  I QUESTION WHY THEY WOULD CHANGE THE BELT IF THERE WAS NO PROBLEM.  I FEEL A SERIOUS INVESTIGATION IS NEEDED TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF ALL DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS OF CHRYSLER AND DODGE VEHICLES.  *NLM",
