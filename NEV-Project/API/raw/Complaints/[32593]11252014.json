        "summary": "THE FUEL PUMP RELAY IS DEFECTIVE.  THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN RECALLED BUT THE PATCH \"FIX\" JEEP DOES DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM COMPLETELY AND THEY KNOW THIS.  THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE COMPUTER WHICH DOES NOT SEND CORRECT SIGNAL TO FUEL PUMP.  ON START CAR WILL NOT START OFTEN BECAUSE IT IS NOT RECEIVING ANY FUEL.  I AM AFRAID THIS CHEAP \"FIX\" JEEP CAME UP WITH WILL CAUSE THE FUEL TO GO OUT WHILE DRIVING.     THE BIGGEST DEFECT WITH THE CAR IS THE V-8 HEMI CAM SHAFT AND LIFTERS.  EVERY MECHANIC I HAVE TAKEN MY CAR TOO HAS SAID THAT JEEP KNOWS IT IS A PROBLEM BUT WILL NOT FIX.  I WAS DRIVING 70 MPH WHEN MY JEEP LOST POWER AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND STARTED FLASHING WHICH WITH THE LOSS OF POWER CAUSE ME TO JUST ABOUT HAVE A WRECK ON THE HIGHWAY.  IT WAS A VERY SCARY SCENARIO.  I TOOK IT TO MY TRUSTED MECHANIC WHO  FOUDN A CYLINDER 2 MISFIRE & PERFORMED A TUNE UP AND HE SAID I NEEDED TO REPORT THE PROBLEM TO JEEP AS THEY ARE KNOWN TO HAVE SEVER PROBLEMS.  THE DEALER CHARGED ME TO \"DIGANOSE\" THE PROBLEM AND REPORTED BACK THAT THE LIFTERS AND CAM SHAFT NEED TO BE REPLACED.  THIS HAS BEEN SUCH A BAD PROBLEM FOR JEEP THE LIFTERS HAVE BEEN ON BACK ORDER MULTIPLE TIMES BUT THEY WILL NOT ADMIT IT IS A PROBLEM.  MY CAR HAS LESS THAN 100,000 MILES AND HAS BEEN METICULOUSLY MAINTAINED AND NOW LOOKIN G AT REBUILDING AN ENGINE AND JEEP WILL ONLY PROVIDE 2 YEAR WARRANTY OR THE WORK, WHICH SHOWS THEY HAVE NO TRUST IN THE FIX AND THERE IS A FATAL FLAW WITH THE V-8 HEMI.  PLEASE FORCE JEEP TO HONOR THEIR CUSTOMERS AND CORRECT THE KNOWN MISTAKES WITH THEIR ENGINES.",
