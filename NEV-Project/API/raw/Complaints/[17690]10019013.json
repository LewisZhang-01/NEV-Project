THE ENTIRE FRONT OF THE CAR IS SMASHED IN, YET THE AIRBAGS DID NOT GO OFF, WHICH, FROM WHAT I HAVE READ AT HTTP://WWW.CONSUMERAFFAIRS.COM/AUTOMOTIVE/CHRYSLER_AIRBAG.HTM THAT THIS IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE IN CHRYSLER VEHICLES.  I SUFFERED A CONCUSSION, THOUGH THE DOCTOR FEARED IT WAS MUCH WORSE, ORDERING UP CAT SCANS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS NO FURTHER BLEEDING IN MY BRAIN.  I FURTHERMORE, HAVE, NOW, A STIFF NECK, WHICH FAILS IN COMPARISON TO OTHER PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD, DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE AIRBAG DID NOT RELEASE AS IS, FROM WHAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD, REQUIRED IF THE  IMPACT IS STRAIGHT-ON FRONT SIDE OVER 5 MPH.  NOW, THAT MAY BE SIMPLY SPECULATION ON MY END, YET, I KNOW RIGHT NOW THAT I HAVE PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE DUE TO A FAULTY AIRBAG.  *NLM",
