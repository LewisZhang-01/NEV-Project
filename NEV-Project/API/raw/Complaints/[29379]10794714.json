A FEW DAYS AGO I NOTICED A GRINDING NOISE AND BURNING SMELL FROM THE REAR OF MY EXPLORER.THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT MY DRIVERS SIDE REAR CALIPER HAD SEIZED UP AND I NEEDED NEW REAR BRAKES. HE SAID THAT THIS WAS DUE TO ROAD SALT, WATER AND DEBRIS CONTAMINATING THE REAR BRAKES. HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS NOT WARRANTY COVERED AND MY COST WAS $389.84. I'VE READ IN NUMEROUS FORUMS THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM ON MOST EXPLORERS LIKE MINE. I FEEL THAT THIS COULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE IF IT HAPPENED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. LUCKILY MINE HAPPENED WHEN I WAS PARKING MY EXPLORER. THIS SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER AN INSPECTION REPLACEMENT RECALL.",
