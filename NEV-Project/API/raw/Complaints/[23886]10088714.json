        "summary": "I RECENTLY PURCHASED A USED 1999 FORD EXPEDITION AND HAVE FOUND THAT THE SIGNAL MIRRORS ARE DEFECTIVE. THE ADHESIVE THAT FORD USED ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE MIRROR GLASS IS EATING AWAY THE SILVER REFLECTIVE SURFACE. I FIRST NOTICED THIS PROBLEM ON OUR TEST DRIVE AND CAN TELL YOU THAT WITH THE RIGHT ANGLE OF THE SUN HITTING THOSE MIRRORS ,YOU CANNOT SEE OUT OF THEM. FORD OFFERED TO REPLACE THEM FOR ABOUT $180.00EA. PLUS $30.00 TO INSTALL. I FEEL THAT FORD SHOULD BE FORCED TO CORRECT THIS DEFECT AND NOT THE CONSUMER BEFORE SOMEONE IS INJURED OR KILLED IN AN ACCIDENT. THANKS FOR LISTENING,RICK.  *AK",
