THEN AT 100,000 MILES IT BEGAN LEAKING. UPON TAKING IT TO MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP, THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE HEAD GASKETS WERE BAD AND NEEDED REPLACING.  THE REPAIRS TOTALED TO $2,400.00.  I KNOW OF ONE OTHER PERSON THAT HAS EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR CHEV. VENTURE. I BELIEVE THIS IS DESIGN FAULT AND SHOULD BE COVERED BY GENERAL MOTORS.",
