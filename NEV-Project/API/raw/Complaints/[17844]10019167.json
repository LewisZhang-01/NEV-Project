MY FAMILY IS NOT SAFE WITH THESE TIRES ON MY NEW EXPEDITION - FOUND OUT CONTINENTAL HAD A RECALL IN 2002 AND WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW OF  ANOTHER PROBLEM - FORD WOULD NOT REPLACE MY TIRES - ONLY THE ONE THAT COULD HAVE KILLED MY FAMILY. THERE IS NO DAMAGE TO THE TREAD - THE TIRE JUST COMPLETELY SEPERATED IN 2 PIECES. I WOULD LIKE TO SEND A PICTURE IF POSSIBLE, AND WOULD GIVE YOU THE TIRES FOR TESTING.",
