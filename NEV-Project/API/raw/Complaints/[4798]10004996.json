RECALL #967 FROM NHTSA.  THEY WERE SUPPOSE TO PUT NEWLY DESIGNED LATERAL ARM BALL JOINTS ON MY VEHICLE AT THAT TIME. THE \"NEW\" BALL JOINTS DIDN'T LAST ONE YEAR AND 8 MONTHS. I WAS TOLD I HAD TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR THIS TIME, FOR WHICH I DID. THE COST WAS $312.60.  I DO NOT BELIEVE I SHOULD BE PAYING FOR THE MATERIAL DEFECTS THAT WERE UNDER THE ORIGINAL RECALL WORK WHICH FAILED IN SUCH A SHORT TIME.",
