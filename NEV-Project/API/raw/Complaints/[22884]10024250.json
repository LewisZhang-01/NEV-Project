THE CONSUMER WENT TO CHECK THE PRESSURE OF THE OUTSIDE TIRE AND IT WAS ALRIGHT.  WHEN THE CONSUMER ATTEMPTED TO CHECK THE PRESSURE OF THE INSIDE PASSENGER TIRE THE EXTENDER VALVE FELL OFF IN THE CONSUMERS HAND AND THE AIR ESCAPED FROM THE TIRE.  IT APPEARED THAT THE EXTENDER VALVE HAD SHEARED OFF.  THE CONSUMER WENT BACK TO THE FLAT TIRE AND NOTICED THAT THE EXTENDER VALVE ON THAT TIRE HAD ALSO SHEARED OFF THUS CAUSING THE TIRE TO GO FLAT.  THE TIRE TECH INFORMED THE CONSUMER THAT THE EXTENDER VALVES WERE NOT INSTALLED PROPERLY AND THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE BRACED.  THE CONSUMER BELIEVES THE WEIGHT OF THE TRUCK CAUSED THE OUTSIDE DUAL TIRE TO BLOW OUT WHEN THE INSIDE TIRE WENT FLAT (INSIDE GOOD YEAR TIRE SIZE 265-70R 19.5  UNISTEEL  G124).  *AK    * CB   *NLM",
