THIS IS A WELL TAKEN CARE OF VEHICLE, PURCHASED NEW,WASHED EVERY MONTH (INCLUDING UNDERCARRIAGE). THE VEHICLE CAME WITH A FACTORY \"UNDERCOATING\", THAT IS STILL INTACT BUT NO LONGER FULLY ATTACHED TO THE STRUCTURE, IT HOLDS THE WATER AGAINST THE METAL AND ROTS IT OUT, WITHOUT THE OWNER EVER BEING ABLE TO SEE THE DAMAGE BEING DONE UNTIL ITS TOO LATE!  IVE NEVER SEEN THIS, EVEN HALF AS BAD, ON ANY CAR THAT WAS TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE (AND IVE BEEN WORKING ON CARS FOR 20 YEARS!)  THIS SEEMS LIKE A DESIGN FLAW BY NISSAN.",
