OTHER CARS IN THE TOYOTA LINE HAVE SAME PROBLEM AND THEY ARE FIXING THE ENGINE FOR FREE, BUT NOT THE 4 RUNNER. THEY HAVE 3 MODELS THAT ARE DOING THE SAME THING, THE ENGINE ARE SLUGGING UP AND CAUSE ENGINE FAILURE. THEY SAID THIS MODEL DOES NOT FALL IN THAT LINE, AND WILL COST ME $9,000 TO FIX, BUT FIRST THEY QUOTE ME $5000.  THE OIL HAS BEEN CHANGED EVERY 3000 MILES OR SO, NOT ALL BY THE DEALER. THE DEALER SEEN THIS PROBLEM WITH MY VEHICLE AND DID NOT SAY ANYTHING TO ME UNTIL IT WAS TO LATE AND NOT REVERSIBLE, TO GET MONEY OUT OF THE CONSUMER. I HAD 3 OTHER CARS WITH WHERE HONDA'S AND THEY NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM, AND TWO OF THOSE HONDA'S HAD OVER 200,000 MILES AND THE OIL WAS CHANGED AT THE SAME INTERVALS AS THE 4 RUNNER.  DO YOU THINK THE CONSUMERS HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY TO FIXED SOMETHING LIKE THIS. $9000 FOR A REBUILT ENGINE, YOU CAN BUY A USED VERY GOOD HONDA FOR THIS PRICE. THIS CAR STILL HAVE A LEAN ON IT.  TOYOTA'S SUPPOSE TO BE GOOD CARS, WITH BAD ENGINES.  ALL MY PROBLEMS START WHEN I TOOK MY CAR IN FOR A RECALL ON SHOCKS AND AFTER THAT THE ENGINE START LEAKING OIL AND SMOKING WHEN I STARTED THE ENGINE.  THE DEALER DID SOMETHING TO MY CAR AND NOW I HAVE TO PAY FOR IT????????????    *NLM",
