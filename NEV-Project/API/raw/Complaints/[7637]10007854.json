THEY HAVE STATED THAT \"ALTHOUGH IT IS A VITAL SAFETY COMPONENT THERE IS NO RECALL AND MY WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED. YOU SHOULD PAY TO HAVE THEM FIXED QUICKLY.\"         I REFUSE TO PAY IN EXCESS OF 500.00 TO THE FORD GARAGE TO FIX A STANDARD SAFETY COMPONENT !  AMONG THE HEAD GASKET , E.G.R., TRANS. , P.W. MOTORS, AND COMPLETE ENGINE REPLACEMENT, I BELIEVE I HAVE PAID FOR ENOUGH OF THEIR FAILURES IN THIS AUTO!       I CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT A COMPANY WOULD DEVISE SUCH A WORTHLESS SAFETY DEVICE AND THEN NOT ONLY ADMIT IT IS HAZARDOUS, BUT TELL CUSTOMERS OF SUCH AN EXPENSIVE ITEM THAT THEY NEED TO GET IT FIXED BY THEMSELVES!  I RELY ON THIS DEVICE TO SAVE MY FAMILY AND MY LIFE! I ONLY WANT THE CHANCE FOR US TO STAY IN THE VEHICLE IN A CRASH, NOT BE EJECTED AND KILLED BECAUSE FORD DID NOT THINK THESE RESTRAINTS WERE USELESS.",
