IF THE DEX COOL CORODES THE CAPS WILL IT NOT FOLLOW IT MAY CORODE OTHER PARTS OF THE SYSTEM?  AND IF GM HAS ADMITTED INSTALLING FAULTY SEALS WHY WON'T THEY AT LEAST RECALL THIS PART AND FIX IT INSTEAD OF MAKING THE CONSUMER FIX IT FOR THEM.  I HAVE BEEN EXPERIANCING COOLING SYSTEM PROBLEMS AND WISH THE COMPANY WOULD AT LEAST FIX THE PROBLEMS THEY ADMIT TO.  I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE GARAGE ONE DAY AND FIND ALL THE COOLANT ON THE FLOOR.*AK",
