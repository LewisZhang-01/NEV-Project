THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP THAT WE BOUGHT IT FROM SAID WE WOULD NEED TO REPLACE IT. OVER $750. NOW THE PASSENGER SIDE TAIL LIGHT IS DOING THE EXACT SAME THING. HUGE SAFETY HAZARD. CLEARLY A FAULTY PART, NOT JUST A BULB GOING OUT, BUT THE ENTIRE ELECTRICAL DESIGN OF THE THE TAIL LIGHT IS FLAWED. GM CHARGES YOU TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE HOUSING WITH THE SAME EXACT FAULTY PART THAT WAS ON THERE BEFORE.",
