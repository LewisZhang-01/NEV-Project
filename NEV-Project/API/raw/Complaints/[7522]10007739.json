SINCE BRAKE PROBLEMS ARE A SAFETY ISSUE, THE DEALERSHIP'S SERVICE DEPARTMENT REPLACED BOTH THE CALIPERS AND ROTORS FREE OF CHARGE UNDER THE WARRANTY.  I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN THAT THE MANUFACTURER IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BUT DOES NOT KNOW WHAT IS CAUSING IT.  SINCE THE EQUIPMENT WAS REPLACED, THE SAME PROBLEM HAS RECURRED.",
