MY CAR LEAKS FLUIDS CONSTANTLY, MY BREAKS DON'T WORK WHEN APPLIED, MY CAR HESITATES IN ALL WEATHER CIRCUMSTANCES, MY WINDSHIELD MAKES A CRACKLING NOISE, MY DOORS SQUEAK ALONG WITH MY TRUNK LID. NOT TO MENTION THAT I GET ANYWHERE FROM 10-15 MILES PER GALLON FOR GAS. I DRIVE FOR ABOUT 40 MIN AND HALF OF MY GAS IS GONE!!! THIS VEHICLE IS A HAZARD TO THE ROAD AND ANYONE OR THING IT COMES IN CONTACT WITH :-( I NEVER RECOMMEND MY CAR TO ANYONE AND AM ASHAMED TO SAY IT'S MINE. DODGE IS DEFINATELY ONE DEALER THAT I WIL NEVER EVER EVER BUY ANOTHER CAR FROM!!!!! *AK",
