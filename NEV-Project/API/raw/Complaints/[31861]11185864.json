SUDDENLY I HEARD LIKE A FAN NOISE, THE OIL LIGHT CAME ON FOLLOWED BY THE ENGINE LIGHT AND THE CAR JUST SHUT OFF! I PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AS SMOKE WAS FILLING THE CABIN. I GOT OUT AND WENT AROUND FRONT AND FLAMES WERE COMING OUT BETWEEN THE HOOD AND THE FENDER ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. I CALLED 911. ONE POLICE AND 2 FIRE TRUCKS SHOWED UP IN NOTHING FLAT! THE FIRE WAS MOVING INTO THE CAB. THE CAR IS A TOTAL LOSS! AFTER MY OWN RESEARCH I FIRMLY BELIEVE IT WAS THE COOLING FAN RESISTOR. THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE NOISE I HEARD AND THE FIRE.",
