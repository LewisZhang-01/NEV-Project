IT WAS DARK AND THE CAR IS BLACK AND I FEARED SOMEONE WOULD HIT ME SINCE THE HAZARD FLASHERS WERE NOW INOPERATIVE. VEHICLE HAD TO BE PUSHED ONTO A SIDE ROAD. A SIMILAR INCIDENT OCCURRED IN JULY 2013 BUT THE VEHICLE WAS IN THE GARAGE AT THE TIME SO IT WASN'T A SAFETY ISSUE. AT THAT TIME THE DEALER INSTALLED A NEW BATTERY SINCE THE ORIGINAL HAD SO MUCH CORROSION THAT IT ATE AWAY AT THE POSITIVE BATTERY POST. I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS CAR AND WILL BE CONTACTING THE DEALER TOMORROW.  *TR",
