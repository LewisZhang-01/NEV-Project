        "summary": "IN NOVEMBER 2002, I PURCHASED A TOYOTA COROLLA 2003. WHEN THE HEAT IS ON, THE CAR EMITS A NAUSEATING ROTTEN EGG SMELL THROUGH THE VENTS. I BROUGHT THE COROLLA INTO A TOYOTA DEALER TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM FIXED. IMMEDIATELY, THE TOYOTA REPRESENTATIVE HANDED ME A MEMO EXPLAINING THAT THIS \"ROTTEN EGG\" SMELL (AS THEY ALSO REFERRED TO IT) CAN OCCUR FROM LOW-OCTANE BRANDS AND THAT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CAR ITSELF. THIS ADVICE CONTRADICTED WHAT THE SALESMAN TOLD ME WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR -- THAT I COULD USE 87 OCTANE GASOLINE. I ASSUME THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM SINCE THEY HAD A MEMO READY FOR COROLLA OWNERS WITH THIS SPECIFIC COMPLAINT. HOWEVER, FOR SEVERAL MONTHS I HAVE BEEN PUMPING 89-93 OCTANE GASOLINE INTO MY CAR WITH NO LUCK -- THE SMELL STILL EXISTS. *AK",
