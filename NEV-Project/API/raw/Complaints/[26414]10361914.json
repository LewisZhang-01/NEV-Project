        "summary": "IN 2008 I PURCHASED A NEW 2007 KIA SPECTRA 5 SX , IN NOVEMBER OF THAT YEAR I WAS RETURNING HOME FROM A DOCTORS APPOINTMENT AND HAD STOPPED AT A STOP SIGN, WHEN MY AUTOS ENGINE STARTED TO REVVING AND MOVING FORWARD WHILE MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE PEDAL, I PRESSED AS HARD AS I COULD WITH MY FOOT , BUT THAT DID NOT STOP THE CAR FROM MOVING FORWARD, THE TIRES WERE SPINNING, I THEN  PUT MY OTHER FOOT ON THE BRAKE PEDAL AND PRESSED AS HARD AS I COULD WAS ABLE TO SHIFT THE GEAR SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL AND THAT STOPPED MOVING FORWARD, BUT THE ENGINE CONTINUED REVVING, I THEN WAS ABLE TO TURN THE IGNITION OFF.  I LET THE CAR REMAIN OFF  FOR ABOUT L5 SECONDS AND TURNED THE IGNITION ON AGAIN THE ENGINE STARTED TO REV AGAIN, I HAD TO TURN ENGINE OFF AGAIN, AFTER ABOUT 15 SECONDS I TURNED THE ENGINE ON AND IT WAS NORMAL SO I WENT HOME AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MY SERVICE PROVIDER TO HAVE THE AUTO CHECKED OUT FOR THIS PROBLEM. THEY COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM. I CALLED THE MANUFACTURER AND SPOKE TO  CASE MANAGER (ALBERT) WHO SUGGESTED I GO TO ANOTHER KIA DEALER.  I WENT TO KIA OF BAYSIDE IN GREAT NECK, N.Y. (THEY ARE OUT OF BUSINESS NOW). THEY INSPECTED THE VEHICLE AND COULD NOT LOCATE THE PROBLEM.  THE TECHNICIAN SUGGESTED THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL MODULE BE DISCONNECTED, WHICH HE DID , AND TOLD ME TO DRIVE CAR FOR TWO WEEKS AND COME BACK TO THE SHOP. I RETURNED TO THE SHOP ON 1/20/09 ( I ORIGINALLY TOOK CAR TO BAYSIDE KIA ON 12/22/08) I TOLD THE TECH THAT NOTHING HAPPENED DURING THE 2 WEEK PERIOD. HE THEN CALLED KIA HEADQUARTERS AND REQUESTED THAT A NEW CRUISE CONTROL MODULE BE INSTALLED.  THE TECH ORDERED THE NEW MODULE FOR THE CAR AND RECONNECTED THE OLD MODULE. ON 01/20/09, I HAD ANOTHER EPISODE WITH THE CAR REVVING AND MOVING FORWARD AND IT ALSO DID THE SAME THING IN REVERSE, THIS WAS IN PELHAM MANOR, N.Y. JUST ACROSS THE BRIDGE FROM WHERE I LIVE, 2 HOURS LATER I WAS AT THE BARTOW MALL , IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD IT HAPPENED AGAIN, IT DONE THIS 4 MORE TIMES KIA REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING . *TR",
