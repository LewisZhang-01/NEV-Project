THIS HAPPENED ABOUT A YEAR AFTER THEY REPLACED THE AIRBAG RELATED TO TAKATA RECALL. SOA HAS OFFERED 1000.00 'IN GOOD WILL GESTURE ' . SAW A RECALL IN 2015 FOR IMPREZA  WAGONS THROWING OFF B1650 CODE. WAS TOLD BY SOA NOT TO DRIVE MY OUTBACK AS THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. I TOTALLY AGREE, BUT ALSO THINK THAT A 6 YEAR OLD OUTBACK SHOULD NOT BE HAVING THIS KIND OF SAFETY ISSUE . I AM UNABLE TO REPAIR DUE TO THE COSTLY REPAIR AND IN MY OPINION THIS IS SUBARU'S RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX! THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY I COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS MALFUNCTION.",
