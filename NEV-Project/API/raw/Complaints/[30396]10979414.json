        "summary": "ECOBOOST ENGINE IN THIS MODEL IS KNOWN TO HAVE FUNCTIONING PROBLEMS WHEN IT WARMS UP AND YOU ARE ON THE HIGHWAY AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  THE TRUCK WILL START TO LOSE POWER AND ALMOST FEEL LIKE IT WILL STALL AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  IT IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH FORD AND WELL DESCRIBED ON MANY AUTO FORUMS ON THE WEB.  I TOOK MY TRUCK IN AND THEY ARE CHARGING ME FOR A \"FIX\".  THIS IS A DOCUMENTED PROBLEM WHICH FORD EVEN HAS AS AN INTERNAL SERVICE BULLETIN ABOUT.  I HAVE NEVER BEEN CHARGED BY ANY OTHER AUTO COMPANY WHEN THEY COME OUT WITH A SERVICE BULLETIN EXCEPT FOR THIS COMPANY.  MORE IMPORTANTLY I HAD TO EXPLAIN WHAT IS ON THE WEB ABOUT THIS TO THE SERVICE TECH AT THE FORD DEALERSHIP--LIKE A PATIENT EXPLAINING TO HIS SURGEON WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND HOW TO OPERATE ON HIM TO FIX IT---VERY ODD AND CONCERNING.  EITHER WAY, IT IS VERY POSSIBLE TO GET INTO AN ACCIDENT ON THE HIGHWAY---AND MAYBE IT HAS ALREADY HAPPENED.  MY SON PRIMARILY DRIVES THIS VEHICLE AND HAS BEEN MENTIONING IT TO ME FOR MONTHS.  I PASSED IT OFF AS BAD GAS OR THE WAY HE WAS DRIVING.  WE HAD TAKEN IT TO A FIRESTONE DEALER FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND THEY RECOMMENDED WE TAKE IT TO THE DEALER .",
