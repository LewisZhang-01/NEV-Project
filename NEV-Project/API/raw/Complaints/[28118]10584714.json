AT OTHER TIMES, THE GAS GAUGE WILL GO FROM FULL TO 1/2 TANK.  OTHER TIMES WHEN YOU START THE CAR, IT WILL SHOW EMPTY WHEN IT HAS 1/2 TANK.  SO IN OTHER WORDS, THE GAS GAUGE IS NOT WORKING.   I UNDERSTAND THAT MANY 2008 HYUNDAI SANTA FE CAR OWNERS ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS.   TO FIX THE PROBLEM, HYUNDAI WANTS EITHER $400 OR $700 TO REPLACE EITHER ONE OR TWO FUEL SENSORS.  OF ALL THE CARS I HAVE OWNED, I HAVE NEVER HAD A FUEL GAUGE GO BAD.  VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH HYUNDAI RIGHT NOW !   WITH AS MANY PROBLEMS WITH THE FUEL GAUGE REPORTED, THIS SHOULD BE FIXED BY THE HYUNDAI.  *TR",
