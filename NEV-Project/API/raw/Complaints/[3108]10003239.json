INTERMITTENTLY VEHICLE HANDLING SEEMS TO LOSE THE POWER ASSIST - TURNING ALL OF THE SUDDEN REQUIRES MORE MUSCLE EFFORT - AND HANDLING GETS VERY STIFF.  SUV HAS STALLED 5 TIMES ALREADY AND DEALER STILL UNABLE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  EVERY TIME - I LOST THE STEERING, THE BRAKES, THE ACCELERATOR AND THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS.  ESCAPE IS A VERY SCARY AND DANGEROUS SUV - UNABLE TO PREDICT WHEN IT WILL STALL OR WHEN IT WILL SUDDENLY ACCELERATE (I DON'T DARE USE THE CRUISE CONTROL).",
