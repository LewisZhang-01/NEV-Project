THERE ARE 3 MORE COILS ON THIS CAR, BUT VW WILL NOT GUARANTEE THAT THEY ARE NOT ALSO DEFECTIVE, AND, THEREFORE, CAN BLOW AT ANY TIME.  VW ADMITS TO HAVING A BIG PROBLEM WITH THE COILS ON THIS VEHICLE, BUT WILL ONLY REPLACE AS EACH ONE BLOWS.  IF THIS HAPPENS ON AT HIGH SPEED, THE VEHICLE MAY VERY WELL CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE TO OTHER DRIVERS AS WELL AS MYSELF.",
