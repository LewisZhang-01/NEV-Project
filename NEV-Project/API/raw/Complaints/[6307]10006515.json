THE BOY WAS PROPERLY SEATED AND BELTED, AND RESTING HIS RIGHT ARM ON THE DOOR SEAL NEXT TO THE WINDOW. THE DRIVER, MY WIFE, LOWERED THE WINDOW AT HIS REQUEST, AS THE WINDOW STARTED DOWN, HIS ARM WAS PULLED INTO THE GAP BETWEEN THE WINDOW AND THE CAR DOOR.  THIS CAUSED PAIN AND SUFFERING, HE WAS ABLE TO PULL HIS HAND OUT OF THE SPACE BEFORE FURTHER INJURED OCCURRED.  THE DESIGN OF THAT WINDOW/DOOR INTERFACE IS FLAWED , AS THERE IS SPACE ENOUGH FOR A CHILD'S HAND TO BE PULLED INTO THE GAP, CAUSING INJURY.
