WE WERE SLOWING TO STOP AT A STOP SIGN TRAVELING 5-10 MPH AND WHEN WE APPLIED THE BRAKE, THE ENGINE REVED UP. WHEN IT HAPPENED TO ME THE THE CAR WOULDN'T STOP WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKE SO I PUT THE CAR INTO NEUTRAL AND THUS AVOIDED HITTING CAR AHEAD OF ME.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MY LOCAL TOYOTA DEALER.  THEY HAD IT FOR A DAY AND HALF AND SAID THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG.  THEY SAID I SHOULD REMOVE MY AFTER MARKET CAR MAT ( WHICH I HAVE) AND SUGGESTED THAT BOTH DRIVERS HAD APPLIED THE BRAKE AND ACCELORATOR AT THE SAME TIME.  I THINK THIS IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY AS MY FOOT ISN'T WIDE ENOUGH TO DO BOTH UNLESS MY FOOT IS NEARLY OFF THE BRAKE. THE CAR MAT IN QUESTION HAS BEEN THE CAR FOR 6 PLUS YEARS AND IS A CUSTOM MADE ONE WHICH DOES NOT SLIP.",
