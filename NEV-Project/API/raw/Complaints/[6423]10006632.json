WAS CONTACTED BUT REFUSED TO REIMBURSE ME FOR $1,985.  THEIR REASON WAS BECAUSE I DID NOT CHOOSE TO HAVE THE WORK DONE AT A FORD SHOP.  THE FORD QUOTE WAS $1,000 HIGHER THAN A NON-FORD SHOP.  SINCE WHEN SHOULD A CUSTOMER BE PUNISHED FOR MITIGATING DAMAGES? I DID HAVE A FORD SHOP ANALYZE THE PROBLEM INITIALLY, BUT AT THAT TIME HAD NO ASSURANCE THAT FORD WOULD REIMBURSE ME, SO WHY SHOULD I SIGN UP TO PAY FORD'S HIGH REPAIR COSTS?  THE ALUMINUM PARTS BEING USED IN THE TRANS. CAN'T STAND HEAT AND THEREFORE FAIL.  FORD NEEDS TO ADMIT POOR QUALITY AND RECALL THEM.    *JB    ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****770821***",
