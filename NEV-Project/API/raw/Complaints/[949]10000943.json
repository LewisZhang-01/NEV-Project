DUE TO THIS SHE HIT A TELEPHONE POLE AND THE CAR WAS TURNED SIDEWAYS AND HIT A TREE THEN WENT OVER A EMBANKMENT.  THE DAMAGE IS ALL TO THE REAR OF THE CAR.  I HAVE CALLED PONTIAC SEVERAL TIMES AND GOTTEN TRANSFERRED TO SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS AND NO ONE ENDS UP HELPING ME.  I ALSO HAVE A TRIED MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND THEY JUST WANT TO FIX THE EXTERIOR AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE PROBLEM.  SHE IS HAVING A VERY HARD TIME DRIVING.  SHE DOES NOT WANT TO GET BACK INTO THIS CAR AFTER IT'S FIXED.  SHE FEELS IF IT'S FIXED ON THE OUTSIDE THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED.  I AM NOT HAVING ANY LUCK WITH ANY OF THE PEOPLE I HAVE CONTACTED.  THERE ARE RECALLS FOR EARLY YEAR SUNFIRES BUT NOT 2002.  IF THEY JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT THE PROBLEM IN EARLIER YEARS HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT THEY FIXED IT IN THIS MODEL YEAR.  TS",
