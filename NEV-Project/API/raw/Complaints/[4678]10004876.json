I AM STILL UNDER A WARRANTY BUT THE DEALERSHIP SAYS IT CANT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT.  I AM CONCERNED THAT MY ENGINE MIGHT SEIZE OR FAIL WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE INTERSTATE DUE TO A DESIGN FLAW IN THE INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET.  THE COOLANY THAT CHEVY USES DEXCOOL HAS BEEN KNOWN TO EAT AWAY THE GASKETS, SO LARGE A SCALE HAS THIS HAPPENED THAT GM HAS SWITCHED COOLANTS TO PRESTONE EXTENDED LIFE.  I WANT A RECALL DONE FREE OF CHARGE TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.  IT IS DEFINITLY A SAFETY ISSUE AS MOST HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT CAMS BREAKING AND LOSS OF POWER.  SOMEONE IS GOING TO DIE BECAUSE OF THIS.",
