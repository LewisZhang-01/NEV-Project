WAS TOLD BY 2 DEALERSHIPS (WHO DID NOT LOOK AT THE CAR) THIS WAS A ROTATION PROBLEM, EVEN THOUGH THE FRONT TIRES WERE FINE.  DEALERSHIP FINALLY REALIGNED REAR WHEELS, BOTH WERE OUT OF TOE TO THE SAME DEGREE.  I COMPLAINED THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD REPLACE THE TIRES SINCE IT WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE FACTORY SETTING AND NOT DUE TO NEGLIGENCE IN MAINTENANCE.  THEY FINALLY AGREED TO PAY HALF THE REPLACEMENT COST OF THE TIRES.    *NLM",
