I TOOK MY CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE RECALL, AND THEY LOOKED AT MY ENGINE AND FIXED THE RATTLE WHICH THEY TOLD ME WAS DUE TO THE PCM NEEDING TO BE RESET....I READ ANOTHER COMPLAINT ABOUT THE ENGINE RATTLE AND THOUGHT I WOULD PUT MINE IN SO THE PERSON COULD READ THIS AND NOW THAT THE RATTLE IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING DUE TO THE RECALL AND NOT THE TYPE OF GASOLINE THEY WERE USING AS THEY WERE TOLD.  *JB",
