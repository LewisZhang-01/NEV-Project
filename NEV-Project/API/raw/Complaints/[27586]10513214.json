I PULLED CODE P0300 WHICH IS A RANDOM MISFIRE DETECTED AS PER CHRYSLER SPECS. VERIFYING ALL PLUGS WERE IN GOOD WORKING ORDER BY PULLING TWO AT A TIME. I RESET THE PCM BY DISCONNECTING THE BATTERY AND PULLING FUSE #11 UNDER THE HOOD. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TURNED OFF AND THE PROBLEM WAS GONE. SINCE THE INCIDENT I HAVE FELT UNSAFE PUTTING MY WIFE AND KIDS IN THE VEHICLE.     POST FILL UP A WEEK LATER SAME THING. I PERFORMED THE SAME STEPS TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM.
