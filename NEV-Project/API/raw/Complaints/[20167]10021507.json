        "summary": "I OWN A 1981 EXCALIBUR SERIES IV PHAETON.  THE UNIT IS BUILT ON A CHEVROLET CORVETTE CHASSIS AND RUNNING GEAR. THREE YEARS AGO I TOOK THE CAR TO COX CHEVROLET IN BRADENTON FLORIDA FOR REPAIR.  COX REPLACED THE FRONT BRAKE ROTORS WITH NEW AC DELCO GENUINE ROTORS. I THEN HAD A SIMILAR PROBLEM AND WAS TOLD THAT THE REAR DISK BRAKE ROTORS WERE LEAKING. I WENT TO TIRE KINGDOM  AND THEY REPLACED THE REAR ROTORS WITH AC DELCO GENUINE DISK BRAKE ROTORS. 2000 MILES AND 18 MONTHS LATER I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO COX CHEVROLET, AND  THE FRONT BRAKE ROTORS WERE LEAKING, AND WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED. I HAD THEM REPLACED. THE BACK ROTORS WERE ALSO LEAKING, SO I RETURNED THE CAR TO TIRE KINGDOM TO HAVE THEM REPLACED AS WELL. MAY OF THIS YEAR, 14 MONTHS AND 1400 MILES LATER, I TOOK THE CAR BACK TO COX CHEVROLET AND THE SEALS ON THE FRONT BRAKE ROTORS WERE LEAKING AGAIN, AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED. THEY PURCHASED THE ROTORS FROM TROPICAL INTERNATIONAL AUTO PARTS OUT OF FT. MEYERS FLORIDA. THEY REPLACED THE ROTORS AGAIN, I CALLED FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL AUTO PARTS, AND THEY SAID THE WARRANTY IS 12 MONTHS OR 12 THOUSAND MILES. THEY DO NOT CARE IF THE VEHICLE HAD ONLY ONE (1) MILE ON IT, IT WAS OVER 12 MONTHS. I CALLED THE AC DELCO CUSTOMER SERVICE TO BE TOLD THE EXACT SAME THING.  I ASKED IF OTHER PEOPLE HAD EVER CALLED ABOUT THE SAME DEFECTIVE BRAKE ROTOR PROBLEM AND THEY SAID THEY HAD NO INFORMATION.  I CALLED GENERAL MOTORS CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER, AND EXPLAINED THE WHOLE THING.  WE HAVE NOW HAD SIX SETS OF ROTORS, FRONT AND REAR REPLACED BECAUSE OF LEAKING SEALS.  THESE ROTORS WERE ALL NEW OR REMANUFACTURED GENUINE AC DELCO PARTS. NOBODY AT THE CHEVROLET DEALER, THE AUTO PARTS SUPPLIER, AC DELCO CUSTOMER SERVICE, OR GM CUSTOMER SERVICE CARE IF THE ENTIRE MANUFACTURING RUN WAS DEFECTIVE!!! THERE ARE 10'S OF THOUSANDS OF GM CARS THAT USE THESE SAME ROTORS THAT MAY LOSE THEIR BRAKES WITHOUT WARNING.  THIS PROBLEM DOES NOT CAUSE THE BRAKE LIGHT TO COME ON AT THE DASH.  *JB",
