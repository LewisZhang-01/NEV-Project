WE TOOK OUR VEHICLE TO DODGE SERVICE AND THEY HAD TO REPLACE THE ROTORS. WE DRIVE OUR CAR VERY CONSERVATIVELY AND NOW IN 2016 WE HAVE 36K MILES. OUR CAR STARTED EXPERIENCING THE SAME SYMPTOMS. WE TOOK THE CAR TO DODGE SERVICE, WHICH CONFIRMED EXTREME ROTOR WEAR AND EVEN COMMENTED THAT IT WAS PREMATURE WEAR. I CONTACTED DODGE AND THEY REFUSED TO REPLACE ANY PARTS.    IN ADDITION, WE RECENTLY (2016) ARE EXPERIENCING RANDOM HORN HONKING. THIS IS INDEED A SAFETY ISSUE AS PROPER HORN FUNCTION IS A REQUIREMENT FOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION.",
