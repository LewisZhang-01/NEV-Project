SEARCHED ONLINE AND TONS OF OTHER 2006-2007 BMW OWNERS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM, ONCE THEY FOUND OUT THE PROBLEM THEY STARTED KEEPING ALL THE PARTS ION STOCK. I EVEN SPOKE TO A DEALERSHIP THAT SAYS THEY HAVE 2 CARS A WEEK FOR THIS; ABSOLUTELY INSANE FOR ONE DEALERSHIP. ITS A WELL KNOWN DEFAULT BUT NOT RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED. IF THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TO LOCK WHILE SOMEONE WAS DRIVING IT COULD BE FATAL.  *TR",
