        "summary": "ON THIS DATE I WAS SUMMONED TO PICK UP MY 2001 FORD SVT F 150 PICKUP FROM MC GILVRAY FORD IN ATHENS, TX AFTER REPLACEMENT OF MY ENGINE VALVE LASH ADJUSTERS  HAD BEEN MADE IN AN ATTEMPT TO STOP RIGHT SIDE ENGINE TICKING. THE VEHICLE STILL MADE THE NOISE AND I GOT THE MECHANIC TO LISTEN. I ASKED HIM IF THEY CHECKED THE SPARK PLUGS BECAUSE THEY ARE KNOWN TO LOOSEN ON THIS TYPE ENGINE DUE TO POOR ENGINEERING. THE MECHANIC DISMISSED MY CONCERN AND INFORMED ME OF THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE NOISE WAS AND THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DRIVE IT A WHILE AND SEE IF THE NOISE LESSENS. 1 WEEK LATER THIS SAME VEHICLE BLEW A SPARK PLUG OUT THUS STRANDING ME ON THE HIGHWAY.     I BELIEVE IT TO BE UNJUST THAT FORD MOTOR COMPANY CAN SELL A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT TO THEIR CUSTOMER AND NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. THIS IS A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM IN THE ENGINE AND IT WOULD BE PROPER FOR FORD MOTOR COMPANY TO REPLACE THE PRODUCT WITH ONE THAT WILL NOT FAIL AGAIN. SUPPOSEDLY THERE IS AN IMPROVED VERSION OF THIS ENGINE HEAD, BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT MY HEAD WILL BE REPLACED WITH THIS NEWER TYPE. THE OTHER HEAD NOW WILL ALSO BE SITTING THERE WAITING TO BLOW ALSO.   *NLM",
