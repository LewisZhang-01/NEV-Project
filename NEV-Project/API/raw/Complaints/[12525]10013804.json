THEN WOULD EITHER BANG INTO GEAR WHEN ACCELERATING, OR WOULD HAVE TO PLACE THE CAR IN PARK, TURN OFF THE ENGINE, RESTART THE ENGINE, AND PLACE IT IN DRIVE.  OFTEN ALL WOULD BE FINE FOR 2-3 WEEKS, THEN THE TRANSMISSION WOULD ACT UP AGAIN.  AFTER THREE OR FOUR MONTHS OF THIS THE TRANSMISSION BEGAN SLIPPING WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A DEAD STOP.  THERE ARE NO UNUSUAL NOISES, THE TRANSMISSION FLUID IS CLEAN AND FULL, AND THE TRANSMISSION APPEARS TO SHIFT FINE ONCE I GET GOING.  I CALLED FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND THEY HAVE NO RECALLS OR KNOWN DEFECTS (OF COURSE).  THE DEALER URGED ME NOT DRIVE THE CAR AND BRING IT INTO THE SHOP RIGHT AWAY.  HE SAID IT WOULD LIKELY COST BETWEEN $1300 AND $2600 TO REPAIR.  *JB",
