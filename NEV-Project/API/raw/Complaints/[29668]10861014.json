        "summary": "MY FAMILY AND I WERE STRANDED DUE TO OUR 2013 HONDA ACCORD NOT STARTING. WE JUST CAME OUT OF THE MOVIES AND THE CAR WAS STATIONARY IN THE PARKING LOT. I TURNED THE KEY AND IT WOULD JUST CLICK. I HAD TO PAY FOR TOWING AND OVER $800 TO HAVE THE STARTER REPLACED AT THE HONDA DEALER. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE, BUT I CALLED ANOTHER DEALER AND THEY PRICE MATCHED THE STARTER. I DRIVE A LOT OF MILE TO WORK SO I HAVE OVER 60K MILES IN 2 YEARS. AFTER DOING A LITTLE RESEARCH I FOUND THAT THIS PROBLEM IS HAPPENING TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. THE PROBLEM CAN BE SEEN ON FORUMS AND YOUTUBE VIDEOS. THIS PROBLEM SEEMS TO AFFECTS NEW CARS, BASE MODELS, PUSH BUTTONS, V6'S ETC.  I THINK THE STARTER SHOULD BE RECALLED BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE ARE BEING FORCED TO REPLACE STARTERS THAT THE DEALER SEEMED TO KNOW WAS BAD.",
