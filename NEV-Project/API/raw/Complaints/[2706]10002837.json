        "summary": "PURCHASED 2002 FORD ESCAPE FROM HINDER FORD OF ABERDEEN, MD IN JUNE 02 AND FROM THE START THE LEFT REAR WHEEL WAS CRACKED AND THE VEHICLE PULLS (NOT DRIFTS) TO THE LEFT SO BAD THAT THE VEHICLE LEFT FRONT TIRE WILL CROSS THE LINE IN 5 SECONDS IF STEERING WHEEL IS RELEASED WHILE IN THE RIGHT LANE OF A TWO LANE AND WITHIN 3 SECONDS IF IN THE LEFT LANE.  HINDER FORD GAVE ME THE FORD 800 NUMBER TO CALL BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO EVEN AFTER I  PROVIDED THEM EXCERPTS FROM MARYLAND LAW THAT STATES A VEHICLE WITH A STEERING OR BRAKING PROBLEM THAT CAN NOT BE FIXED THE FIRST TIME IS TO BE REPLACED.  THEY HAVE REFUSED.  I COMPLAINED TO THE ON-LINE CUSTOMER SERVICE SEVERAL TIMES UNTIL THEY FINALLY SENT THE AREA FORD TECH TO INVESTIGATE.  HE REPLIED THAT THERE WAS DEFINITELY A PROBLEM (HE STATED HE HAD SEEN THIS BEFORE), ATTEMPTED TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  HINDER RETURNED THE VEHICLE AND AGAIN STATED THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.  I SENT CERTIFIED/RETURN RECEIPT LETTERS TWICE TO FORD MOTOR CO. AND LATEST RESULT WAS A CALL LAST WEEK FROM MR. DUNCAN ALBERSON WHO AGREED THAT A CRACKED WHEEL AND THIS VEHICLE LEAVING THE ROAD WITHIN THREE SECONDS WAS NOT SAFE, BUT THAT HE WAS GOING WITH A REPORT THAT HE HAD FROM THE AREA FORD TECH WHO STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS WITHIN SPECIFICATION AND THAT I SHOULD DRIVE WITH MY HANDS ON THE STEERING WHEEL!  I STATED I RELEASE THE WHEEL ONLY TO EMPHASIZE THE DRASTIC PULL OF THIS STEERING AND OF COURSE I DRIVE WITH MY HAND ON THE WHEEL AT ALL TIMES!  I TOLD MR. DUNCAN TO SIMPLY SEND ANOTHER TECH TO TEST DRIVE MY VEHICLE ANY TIME AND ANY PLACE AND HIS RESPONSE ... HE HUNG UP!  POSSIBLY BECAUSE I ALSO TOLD HIM HINDER FORD HAS SOLD TWO OTHER VEHICLE WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM.  IF YOU KNOW OF A GOOD LAW FIRM IN MY AREA PLEASE GIVE ME THEIR NUMBER. TS",
