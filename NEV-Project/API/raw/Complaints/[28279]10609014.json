        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING MY CAR I HAD TO PUSH ON THE BRAKES FAIRLY HARD. THE SEAT BELT RETRACTED AND THEN STAYED RETRACTED. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A PROPER REPLACEMENT FOR THE DRIVERS SIDE SEAT BELT AND HAVE YET TO FIND ONE FOR LESS THAN $200.00 FOR A USED ONE AND OVER $300.00 FOR A REFURBISHED ONE. GM JUST HAPPENS TO HAVE NEW ONES BUT THEY ARE ALMOST $500.00  ACCORDING TO THE REP FROM GM.THESE SEAT BELTS HAVE A CHARGING CYLINDER ON THEM THAT SETS OFF THE AIR BAG. THAT ALONE CAUSES YOU TO HAVE TO SHIP IT AS A HAZARDOUS MATERIAL.IF YOU CAN FIND SOMEONE TO SHIP IT AT A REASONABLE COST. (NOT HAPPENING)IF YOU GO WITH THE \"UNIVERSAL\" SEAT BELT SOLD BY SOME COMPANIES THEY DON'T EVEN WORK AND YOU ARE TOLD TO JUST CUT THE SEAT BELT TO MAKE IT FIT. KIND OF DESTROYS THE INTEGRITY OF THE SEAT BELT BY DOING THAT I WOULD THINK. I HAVE MADE TWO COMPLAINTS WITH GM ABOUT THIS AND CONSIDERING THEY HAD JUST RECALLED THE 2004-2009 SAAB'S FOR THE EXACT SAME ISSUE I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT WORK WITH ME TO SOME EXTENT. I KNOW NOW THAT IT IS NOT THE CASE. THANK YOU FOR ANY HELP YOU CAN PROVIDE.
