I HAD MY OIL CHANGED REGULARLY AND MAINTAINED MY VEHICLE PROPERLY. I HAVE ALREADY REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION, VARIOUS SENSORS AND VISITED THE DEALER 3 TIMES TO CORRECT AN OIL LEAK. I WAS NEVER DIAGNOSED WITH AN ENGINE PROBLEM UNTIL IT FINALLY SHUT DOWN. WHILE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 45 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY, THE ENGINE STARTED TO MAKE A LOUD NOISE AND RATTLED CONTINUOUSLY. THIS WAS VERY SURPRISING, CONSIDERING THE VEHICLE WAS NORMALLY A QUIET RIDE. THE SHOP TOLD ME MY ENGINE WAS BLOWN AND THE WARRANTY COMPANY DENIED MY CLAIM. I AM STILL FINANCING THIS VEHICLE AND DO NOT HAVE THE 6,500.00 TO REPLACE THIS ENGINE. I SEE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON THIS SITE AND OTHERS ABOUT THE 2.7 LITER ENGINES. THERE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE A RECALL.   *JB",
