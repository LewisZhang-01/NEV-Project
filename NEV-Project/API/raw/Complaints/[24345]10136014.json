HE SAID HE HEARD A GRINDING NOISE IN THE VEHICLE AND HAD NO BRAKES.  HE WENT OFF THE CURVE AND HIT A TREE.  THE TRUCK WAS TOTALED.  MY SON AS WELL AS HIS TWO FRIENDS WERE TAKEN TO AREA HOSPITALS LUCKILY, NO ONE WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED AS THEY HAD THEIR SEAT BELTS ON AND WERE  GOING THE SPEED LIMIT.  I WOULD HATE TO SAY WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAVELING AT A FASTER RATE OF SPEED.  AFTER SEEING SIMILAR COMPLAINTS FILED BY OTHER 2001 S-10 OWNERS, I'M WONDERING IF SOMEONE WILL HAVE  TO BE KILLED BEFORE THEY RECTIFY THIS BRAKE PROBLEM.  *JB",
