THIS APPEARS TO BE A KNOWN PROBLEM AND BUICK DID NOT OFFER TO SHARE ANY OF THE REPAIR EXPENSE.  THE PLASTIC MANIFOLD, WAS OVER $300 FOR THE PART, WHICH SHOULD HAVE NOT FAILED, OR AT LEAST SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHEAP TO REPLACE SINCE IT WAS PLASTIC.  THIS IS A LONG TERM KNOW DEFECT AND BUICK SHOULD HAVE RECALLED THIS AND FIXED IT IN THE NEWER VEHICLES.   *NLM",
