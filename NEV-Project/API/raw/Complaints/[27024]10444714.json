EVERY TIME IT RAINS MY SERPENTINE BELT COMES OFF WHICH CAUSES EXTREMELY HARD STEERING. I HAVE REPLACED TENSIONERS TWICE IN THE AND BELT 4 TIMES.  THANK GOD I WAS NOT ON THE FREE WAY OR A STREET WITH ALOT OF   TRAFFIC OR THIS COULD KILL ME OR AN OTHER PERSON.   I HAVE LOOKED ON THE INTERNET AND THIS HAS HAPPENED TO 100S OF PEOPLE.  ON THE INTERNET IT STATE THAT THE    FACTORY RECOMMENDED REPAIR  ( THE REPLACEMENT OF THE IDLER PULLEY    AND THE PULLEYS RETAINING BRACKET.) IN THE TSB I READ, CHRYSLER'S ENGINEERS HAVE DECIDED THAT ON SOME MODELS THE  IDLER PULLEY IS MISALIGNED BY .08 INCHES.                              CHRYSLER SHOULD RECALL THIS AND FIX THERE PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED.                                                                              GET INVOLVED AND MAKE CHRYSLER FIX THIS PROBLEM.  *TR",
