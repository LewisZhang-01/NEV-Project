IT HAS NOW GOTTEN SO BAD THAT IT HAS BECOME A SAFETY HAZARD. IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT SETTING ( DELAY, SLOW OR FAST) THE WIPERS ARE SET AT THEY REACT ON THEIR OWN. SOMETIMES THEY STOP COMPLETELY WHICH CAUSES A SEVERE SAFETY HAZARD WHEN DRIVING IN THE RAIN. YOU COULD HAVE THE SETTING ON SLOW DELAY AND THEY WILL BEGIN GOING VERY FAST OR MEDIUM SPEED, THEN CHANGE AGAIN FOR NO REASON. THEY ALSO CONTINUE TO RUN WHEN THE SWITCH IS TURNED COMPLETELY OFF. THIS STARTED ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO AND HAS INCREASED IN INTENSITY WITH EACH USE DUE TO RAIN. I UNDERSTAND PREVIOUS YEAR MODELS WERE RECALLED FOR A VERY SIMILAR PROBLEM AND I AM WONDERING IF THIS YEARS MODEL HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE RECALL LIST?  *NLM",
