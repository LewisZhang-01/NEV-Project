THE TIRE LOST PRESSURE IMMEDIATELY AND CAUSED TEMPORARY LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE CAR.  THE WEATHER WAS ONLY AND 30 DEGREES, AND I OPENLY HAD MYSELF AND EMPTY TRUNK CAR.  THE TIRES WERE PURCHASED AT AN AUTHORIZED GOODYEAR DEALER AND INSTALLED WITH A SET OF EQUALLY SIZED FOUR TIRES. CORPORATE AND RETAIL GOODYEAR PEOPLE WILL ONLY REPLACE THE TIRE IF THEY CAN BE PROVED THAT IT WAS DEFECT IN THE MANUFACTURING OF THE TIRE, NOT WITH INSTALLATION OR ANY OTHER CHARATERISITICS.  THE PREVOIUS TIRE ON THAT RIM WAS A GOODYEAR TIRE THAT LASTED 45000 MILES WITHOUT INCIDENT, SO RIM DAMAGE APPEAR TO BE NOT LIKELY.",
