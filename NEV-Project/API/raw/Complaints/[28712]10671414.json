IT CONTINUED TO GET WORSE AND HAPPENED EACH TIME I WOULD COME TO A STOP. DEALER CONFIRMED THAT ROTORS WERE WARPED. NOW IN A PREVIOUS COMPLAINT, I WROTE ABOUT MY TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS. I DON'T KNOW IF THE ROTORS WERE JUST DEFECTIVE OR IF THEY BECAME WARPED DUE TO BEING OVERHEATED WITH FRICTION AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSMISSION NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.     I JUST WANT TO MAKE OTHER OWNERS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM.     ONCE THE DEALER REPLACED THE ROTORS, THE VIBRATION STOPPED.   *TR",
