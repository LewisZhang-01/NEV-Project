WHEN THE CAR WAS STILL VERY NEW THIS RECALL WAS CONDUCTED AND MY VEHICLE WAS \"FIXED\" ACCORDING TO DEALER RECORDS. NOW I AM HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM AGAIN AND THE DEALER AND MITSUBISHI MOTORS SAY IT IS MY PROBLEM NOW. IF THEIR RECALL DOES NOT WORK THEN THEY SHOULD BE LIABLE, NOT ME. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE, OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THEIR BRAKE FAIL COMPLETELY AND NOT BE ABLE TO STOP BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE. MITSUBISHI SHOULD HAVE CORRECTED THIS PROBLEM FREE OF CHARGE UNTIL THEY GET IT RIGHT, NOT JUST THE FIRST TIME! I WILL NEVER BUY MITSUBISHI AGAIN!  THIS CONSISTENT PROBLEM IS PUTTING PEOPLES LIVES AT RISK.   *TR",
