THE SHODDY RACK & PINION NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND I HAVE GONE THROUGH NUMEROUS TIRES OVER THE YEARS.  THE INTAKE GASKETS ARE LEAKING FLUIDS AND AN ENGINE BLOW OUT IS IMMINENT.  WITH THE LEAKAGES, THE CAR IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE.  I HAVE MAINTAINED ALL REQUIRED MAINTENANCE ACCORDING TO THE MANUAL AND THE CAR IS STILL UNDER 50,000 MILES BUT I AM LOOKING AT A HUGE MECHANIC'S BILL DUE TO A SHODDY RACK & PINION AND INTAKE GASKET LEAKS. *JB",
