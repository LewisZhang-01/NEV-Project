I WAS TRAVELING 65 MILES PER HOUR WHEN MY WINDOW FELL INTO MY DOOR.  THE DAY PRIOR I ROLLED MY WINDOW UP AT THE POST OFFICE AND HEARD A CRUNCHING OR CRACKING SOUND AS THE WINDOW REACHED THE TOP.  I TOO DID NOT THINK MUCH OF IT UNTIL MY WINDOW FELL IN.    TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM I PAID A FORD DEALERSHIP IN LOVELAND, COLORADO $400 TO REPLACE THE DAMAGED PARTS IN MY DOOR.  THE OLD PART IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE AS I ASSUME THEY THREW IT AWAY.    I BELIEVE THIS TO BE A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD AS AT 65 MILES PER HOUR IN A DRIVING WIND A LOT OF DUST/DIRT DEBRIS ENTERED MY TRUCK UNTIL I GOT PULLED OVER ON THE HIGHWAY.  LUCKILY I DID NOT GET ANYTHING IN MY EYES.  FORD SHOULD BE FORCED TO RECALL THESE REGULATORS AND REFUND PEOPLES EXPENSE THAT HAVE ALREADY FIXED THIS.  *CN",
