THE VISORS DROP WITHOUT WARNING MULTIPLE TIMES EVERY DAY SINCE THE PROBLEM BEGAN TO OCCUR. THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD AS THE DRIVER'S SIDE SUNVISOR RANDOMLY DROPS DOWN WITHOUT WARNING COMPLETELY OBSCURING THE DRIVER'S VISION.    REPORTED THE DEFECT TO MY TOYOTA DEALER AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE ONLY OPTION WAS TO PAY FOR REPLACEMENTS AT A COST OF SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH. THIS ASSESSMENT WAS GIVEN WITHOUT ANY INSPECTION OF THE VEHICLE AND IN A MANNER WHICH STRONGLY IMPLIED THAT THIS WAS A PROBLEM WHICH THEY WERE VERY FAMILIAR WITH. AFTER SPEAKING TO TOYOTA, I DECIDED TO RESEARCH THIS FOR MYSELF ON THE WEB AND FOUND MANY SIMILAR INCIDENTS. THIS IS CLEARLY A DANGEROUS DESIGN DEFECT AND NEEDS TO BE REMEDIATED BY THE MANUFACTURER URGENTLY BEFORE SOMEONE'S FAMILY IS KILLED BECAUSE THE VISOR DROPS AND BLOCKS THEIR VIEW OF THE TRAFFIC AHEAD. *TR",
