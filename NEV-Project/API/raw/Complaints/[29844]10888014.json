        "summary": "I RODE HOME FOR 3 HOURS IN A DRIVING RAIN STORM AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS. I LOST ALL GAUGES AND INDICATION AS WELL AS THE CRUISE CONTROL. THIS INCLUDES SPEEDOMETER, TACHOMETER, TURN SIGNAL INDICATORS, FUEL GAUGE, VOLTMETER & ODOMETER. ALL FUSES CHECKED OUT FINE. I RESEARCHED THE ISSUE ON TWO FORUMS I BELONG TO. I FOUND THREE MORE PEOPLE ON THE ROADGLIDE.ORG FORUM AND ONE SO FAR ON THE HDFORUMS.COM THAT REPORTED THE SAME ISSUE WHEN EITHER RIDING IN THE RAIN OR WASHING THE MOTORCYCLE. ALL OF THEM WERE REPAIRED BY REPLACING THE SPEEDOMETER/TACHOMETER CLUSTER. I CURRENTLY HAVE MY MOTORCYCLE IN THE SHOP FOR A NEW SPEEDOMETER CLUSTER AS WELL. I CALLED HARLEY DAVIDSON CUSTOMER SERVICE TO COMPLAIN AND TO ASK IF THEY WILL ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF A POORLY SEALED INSTRUMENT CLUSTER. THEY WERE NO HELP. MY CONCERN IS THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO LOSE MY SPEEDOMETER AND ALL OTHER GAUGES AND INDICATION WHEN RIDING IN A STORM. DANGEROUS TO NOT KNOW YOUR SPEED ON WET ROADS. I CAN INCLUDE MY WARRANTY REPAIR ORDER WHEN I GET THE BIKE BACK IF YOU WANT IT.",
