WE WERE TRAVLING DOWN I-40 WHEN WE HEARD A LOUD BANG, DIDN'T THINK IT WAS US SINCE OUR TIRES WERE NEW.  I LOOKED IN THE SIDE MIRROR AND SAW INSULATION AND KNEW A TIRE HAD EXPLODED.  WE PULLED OVER, MY HUSBAND PUT ON THE SPARE, GOT BACK ON THE ROAD.  ABOUT 30 MINUTES LATER A SECOND TIRE EXPLODED.  WE MADE IT TO AN EXIT AND A SUPER CENTER WAL-MART.  THE OTHER TIRES AT THAT POINT HAD DEVELOPED AN ORANGE TINT TO THEM.  AFTER THE MECHANIC INSPECTED THEM, WE WERE ADVISED NOT TO TRAVEL ANY FURTHER ON THE REMAINING TIRES.  AT THAT POINT WE HAD 4 BRAND NEW TIRES PUT ON.  THERE HAS BEEN DAMAGE DONE UNDERNEATH OUR CAMPER.  OUR CAMPER DEALER HAS FAXED AN ESTIMATE OF DAMAGES TO CARLISLE TIRE & WHEEL.  WE ALSO SAVED THE TIRES AND UPS PICKED THEM UP AND DELIVERED THEM BACK TO CARLISLE TIRE & WHEEL.  I HAVE FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE TIRE COMPANY AND SENT THEM ALL THE DOCUMENTATION.  NOW I'M WAITING ON A RESPONSE AND WAS NOT GIVEN A TIME FRAME AS TO WHEN THAT WILL BE.",
