        "summary": "SATURN SL2 WAS TAKEN TO DEALERSHIP FOR 15,000 CHECK UP ON 3/17/, AS I WAS SELLING TO SON.  CAR HAS APPROX. 15,690 MILES ON IT.  SERVICE MGR. HOWARD GORMAN TOOK INFORMATION. MY HUSBAND TOLD HIM THE PLACE THAT CHANGES THE OIL SAID TO HAVE ANTI-FREEZE FLUSHED BECAUSE  WE WERE LOSING ANTI-FREEZE AND WE COULD NOT SEE LEAK.  MR. GORMAN AFTER CHECKING CAR AND CALLING US, PERFORMED CLOSE TO $500 WORTH OF REPAIRS ON CAR, INCLUDING ROTATING TIES ETC.  HE THEN TOLD US THAT CAR MAY HAVE A HAIRLINE CRACK IN HEAD.  THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN ON A CAR WITH THIS LOW MILEAGE.  I BOUGHT THE CAR NEW AT SATURN NORTH, 8600 NORTH HIGH ST., WORTINGTON, OHIO.  I DRIVE CAR BACK AND FORTH TO WORK WHICK IS APPROX. 8 MILES ONE WAY. MR. GORMAN SUGGESTED THAT WE TAKE CAR HOME AND PUT SOME MILES ON THE CAR AS IT IS NOT DRIVEN FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. IT STAY IN GARAGE AND IS NOT LEFT OUT IN WEATHER.  HE PUT DIE IN THE ANTI-FREEZEE TO CHECK AND ASKED US TO BRING BACK IN A WEEK AND HE WOULD RECHECK.  WE TOOK THE CAR BACK ON 3/31/03 AT THIS TIME MR. GORMAN TOLD US SPECIAL DIE CAME THROUGH THE HEAD ON #4 CYLINDER POSITION. AFTER TAXES IT WOULD COST US $3000 TO FIX.  WE ARGUED AND COMPLAINED . THEY TOLD US THEY WOULD REDUCE THAT TO $2,268.35 BECAUSE OF THE LOW MILES.  I THEN CALLED A CHRISTIE AT SATURN HEADQTRS. AFTER MR. GORMAN SUGGESTED WE DO THIS. SHE TOOK SEVERAL DAYS TO GET BACK TO US AND TODAY TOLD US SATURN WOULD DO NOTHING FOR US.  I FEEL THAT FOR A HEAD TO HAVE A CRACK AT 15,000 MILES IS HORRIBLE AND WONDER HOW MANY OTHER CARS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.  THIS IS MY SECOND SATURN AND THE FIRST CAR I TRADED IN HAD ONLY 16,000 MILES ON IT.  IT IS MY WORK CAR AND I DO NOT DRIVE GREAT DISTANCES.  THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.",
