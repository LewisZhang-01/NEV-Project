THE REPAIR REQUIRED A REPLACEMENT HEAD ASSEMBLY; HOWEVER, NO HEADS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.  ONLY OPTION FROM FORD WAS TO REPLACE THE ENGINE!  THE ENGINE HAD ALREADY BEEN REPLACED AT 33,900 MILES DUE TO A PISTON SLAP PROBLEM.  THE CYLINDER HEAD ONLY HAD 25,000 MILES ON IT WHEN THE SPARK PLUG BLEW OUT.  FORD WOULD NOT PROVIDE ANY ASSISTANCE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE ENGINE WARRANTY RAN OUT AT 24,000 MILES.",
