MY 'CHECK ALL WHEEL DRIVE SYSTEM' WARNING ALARM CAME ON SHORTLY FOLLOWED BY THE: CHECK ENGINE, BATTERY ALARM, COLLISION BREAKING SYSTEM, ETC. I'M CERTAIN THERE WERE MORE ALERTS GOING OFF; HOWEVER I WAS TRYING TO STEER A CAR, THAT HAD LOST POWER OFF THE ROADWAY. I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR SAFELY ONTO THE SHOULDER WHERE I ATTEMPTED TO TURN OFF THE VEHICLE. I COULDN'T TURN THE CAR OFF UNTIL I REALIZED I NEEDED THE CAR TO BE IN PARK. AFTER I TURNED THE CAR OFF I NOTICED BLACK SMOKE COMING FROM THE ENGINE AND COULD SMELL SOMETHING BURNING. I OPENED THE DOOR & GOT MY THREE YEAR OLD SON OUT OF THE CAR & NOTICED MORE BLACK SMOKE. I QUICKLY DISTANCED MYSELF FROM THE VEHICLE & NOTICED FIRE COMING FROM THE ENGINE. I CALLED 911 BUT THE CAR WAS ENGULFED IN FLAMES WITHIN MINUTES. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED WITHIN 5 MINUTES & WERE ABLE TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE.  *JS",
