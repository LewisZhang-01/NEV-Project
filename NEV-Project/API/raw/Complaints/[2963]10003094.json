        "summary": "I HAVE A 1998 DODGE STRATUS AND LIKE MANY OTHERS THE HEAD GASKET NEEDS REPLACING.  I WAS TOLD ABOUT THIS IN JULY 2002.  I WAS TOLD BY SERVICE THAT THIS WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM AND THAT CHRYSLER WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE EXPENSE OF THE REPAIR AND IT WOULD ONLY COST ME $200.  AT THE TIME I COULD NOT AFFORD THE REPAIR.  ALSO, THE LEAK WAS NOT THAT BAD.  I WAS LED TO BELIEVE THAT THE $200 WOULD BE THE COST WHEN I HAD THE REPAIR WORK DONE.      WHEN I CALLED TO MAKE THE APPOINTMENT JAN 20, 2003 BECAUSE THE LEAK WAS STARTING TO GET WORSE, I ASKED THE SERVICE PERSON IF THIS $200 COST WAS STILL IN EFFECT.  HE SAID HE CHECKED ON IT AND WAS TOLD IT WAS.  AFTER I DROPPED OFF THE CAR, I GOT A CALL LATER IN THE MORNING TELLING ME IT WOULD COST ME FULL PRICE.    MY ISSUE IS THAT SINCE THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM ON THE 98 STRATUS WHY HASN'T CHRYSLER (DODGE) BEEN MADE TO ISSUE A RECALL.  THE REALIZED THE PROBLEM WITH THE HEAD GASKET BECAUSE THEY CHANGED THE HEADGASKET PART APPROXIMATELY NOV 1998 IN PRODUCTION AND REPLACEMENTS.",
