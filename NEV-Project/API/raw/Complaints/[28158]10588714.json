        "summary": "MY VEHICLE'S AIR BAG LIGHT CAME ON AND I HAD IT INSPECTED BY KEYES CHEVROLET, A REGISTERED SATURN SERVICER.  HE INFORMED ME THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG MODULE WAS FAULTY AND IT WOULD BE ABOUT 900-1000 DOLLARS TO FIX IT.  THEY DIDN'T PRINT ME THE ESTIMATE OR THE PART NUMBER.  I WENT TO AN INDEPENDENT  MECHANIC WHO SAID THE PART WAS INDEED AROUND 500 DOLLARS, BUT THE AIRBAG SENSOR SHOULD NOT BE FAULTY AFTER ONLY 62,000 MILES.  MY EXTENDED SERVICE PLAN THROUGH FORD REFUSES TO COVER THIS EXTREME SAFETY HAZARD.  IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED TO ME OR MY PASSENGER DUE TO THIS ISSUE I WOULD ABSOLUTELY FILE A LAWSUIT.  THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY NEARLY A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FIX ESPECIALLY SINCE I AM GOING THROUGH A RECALL RIGHT NOW WITH THE IGNITION- AND THEY STILL DO NOT HAVE THE PARTS IN, MAY CAR COULD SLIP INTO DRIVE OR REVERSE WHILE IN PARK AND THEY SAID IT WOULD TAKE 2 MONTHS TO GET THE RECALL PARTS IN?  THIS IS ALL TERRIFYING AND UNACCEPTABLE.  *TR",
