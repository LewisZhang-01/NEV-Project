MY VAN HAS BEEN AT THE DEALERSHIP TWICE NOW.  I HAD TO ASK FOR A MONITOR TO BE PUT ON THE ENGINE TO DETECT WHAT WAS HAPPENING. THIS WAS NOT OFFERED TO ME, BUT SOMEONE I WORK WITH HAD A DODGE VAN WITH THE VERY SAME PROBLEM AND THEY HAD A MONITOR PUT ON THEIRS. CURRENTLY THE VAN IS STALLING, I AM PUSHING THE BUTTON ON THE MONITOR HOPING THE PROBLEM WILL BE DETECTED. THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THE VAN HAS BEEN IN FOR THIS PROBLEM THAT THEY CAN NOT FIGURE OUT. AS SOMEONE I WORK WITH HAD A DODGE VAN, AN OLDER ONE, BUT SAME VAN, WITH THE SAME SYMPTOMS IT MAKES ME CONCERNED THAT MY VAN HAS SOME KIND OF DEFECT. AS THIS IS MY ONLY CAR, AND I CAN NOT AFFORD A NEW ONE AT THIS TIME I AM FORCED TO DRIVE IT NEVER EVER KNOWING WHEN IT WILL STALL AND I WILL LOOSE CONTROL AS I LOOSE MY POWER BRAKES AND STEERING. INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS.",
