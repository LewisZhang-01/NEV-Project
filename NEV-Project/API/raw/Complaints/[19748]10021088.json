I TOOK IT MY LOCAL DEALER FOR A OIL PRESSURE DROP, AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT  THE BEARINGS WERE BAD. AFTER SOME INVESTIGATING ON THE INTERNET I HAVE FOUND THAT CHEVROLET MAY HAVE BEEN AWARE OF A PROBLEM WITH THE BEARINGS, HAVING ISSUED A TSB[87-61-22]. NOW THAT A NEW ENGINE HAS BEEN INSTALLED  AT MY COST OF $4600, I AM LOOKING FOR SOME HELP OR INFORMATION ON HOW TO RECOUP SOME OR ALL OF THE COST. I HAVE HAD ALL POSSIBLE MAINTENANCE DONE AND ALL RECALL WORK DONE SINCE 1997. CHEVROLET HAS INFORMED ME THAT SOME RECALL WORK WAS NOT DONE, BUT MY DEALER RECORDS SHOW IT HAS BEEN DONE.*AK",
