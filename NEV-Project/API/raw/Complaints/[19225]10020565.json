        "summary": "MY VEHICLE, A 1999 PONTIAC GRAND PRIX GT, LOSES POWER STEERING WHEN TURNING LEFT (ONLY LEFT TURNS - NOT RIGHT TURNS).  IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO MAKE A LEFT HAND TURN.  I NEED TO PULL HARD WITH BOTH HANDS TO GET MY STEERING WHEEL TO TURN.  SOMETIMES WHEN THE STEERING DOES NOT RESPOND, I AM FORCED TO DISCONTINUE MY LEFT TURN, PUT MY CAR IN REVERSE, BACK UP THE VEHICLE, AND TRY AGAIN BECAUSE THE STEERING DOES NOT WORK WHEN TURNING LEFT.  ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION I HAVE ALMOST HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE BECAUSE THE STEERING WHEEL HAS NOT RESPONDED WHILE I WAS DRIVING.  I HAVE CALLED THE GM OWNER HOTLINE SEVERAL TIMES TO NO AVAIL. OF INTEREST.  THE 1998 GRAND PRIX IS BEING RECALLED FOR THIS EXACT SAME PROBLEM.  AFTER SEVERAL PHONE CALLS TO GM, THEY HAVE STILL NOT EVEN AGREED TO LOOK AT MY VEHICLE.  I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO BRING MY VEHICLE TO AN ACCREDITED GM PONTIAC RETAILER AND I PAID TO HAVE THE VEHICLE LOOKED AT AND THE PROBLEM DIAGNOSED. THE MAN AT THE DEALERSHIP PROVIDED A WRITTEN QUOTE DESCRIBING THE PROBLEM THAT THE 1998 GRAND PRIX IS BEING RECALLED. UNFORTUNATELY, GM WON'T LISTEN TO ME BECAUSE MY VEHICLE IS A 1999, WHICH IS NOT BEING RECALLED.      *TT",
