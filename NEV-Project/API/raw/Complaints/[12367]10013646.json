THERE IS A GRINDING/RUBBING NOISE COMING FROM THE FRONT OF CAR. I WAS TOLD IT NEEDED NEW ROTORS AND PADS....WELL I HAVE DONE THAT TWICE NOW WITHIN THE LAST 4 MONTHS, AND STILL THE NOISE IS THERE. THEN I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE TRANSMISSION....REPLACED THAT AND THE NOISE IS STILL THERE. NOW I HAVE FOUND OUT BY ALL OF THE OTHER HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS CAR THAT THE NOISE IS MORE THAN LIKELY FAULTY GOODYEAR TIRES. WHEN I CALLED LOCAL PONTIAC DEALER THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD DO WITHOUT CHARGE BECAUSE OF NO RECALL ON THE TIRES. I AM TO MY BOILING POINT WITH THIS CAR AND SOMETHING HAS GOT TO BE DONE BY PONTIAC.    *NLM",
