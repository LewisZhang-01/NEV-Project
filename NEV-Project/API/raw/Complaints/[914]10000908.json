        "summary": "ACTUALLY THE COMPLAINT IS IN REGARD TO A NEAR MISS CONDITION WHILE DRIVIING MY 1994 DAMON ULTRASPORT (FORD E350) MOTOR HOME. WHILE REURNING FROM VACATION I NOTICED THAT THE STEERING ON THE FRONT OF MY MOTORHOME WAS LOOSE AND AS I WAS PASSED BY A TRACTOR TRAILER RIG IN IOWA ON INTERSTATE 80 THE WIND TURBULANCE CAUSED MY VEHICLE STEERING TO BE VERY ERRATIC. I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN FOR A SERVICE CALL AND EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM TO THE SERVICE MECHANIC AT MONTICELLO FORD. THEY INSPECTED THE VEHICHLE AND SAID THE TOP BALL JOINTS WERE WORN APPROXIMATELY AN 1/8\". FORD SAID THE TOLERANCE IS 1/4' AND MY WARRANTY WILL NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS MEMORY STEERING BY THE MECHANIC. IN THE ABSENCE OF WARRANTY COVERAGE FOR AN $800 REPAIR, HE RECOMMENDED REPLACING THE THE STEERING DAMPENER TO SEE IF IT HELPS MITIGATE THE PROBLEM. IT SEEMED TO REDUCE THE PROBLEM BUT HAS NOT ELIMINATED IT. HE DOES NOT RECOMMEND A FRONT END ALIGNMENT WITH THE BALL JOINTS BEING SO LOOSE. HE ALSO MENTIONED HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHY FORD SPECIFIES A 1/4\" WHEN CHRYSLER SPECIFIES 1/16\" WERE LIMITS ON THE BALL JOINTS. MY COMPLAINT IS THAT FORD HAS A SPECIFICATION THAT IS NOT REALISTIC AND PUTS THE LIVES OF THEIR VAN AND MOTORHOMES DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS AT RISK EPSPECIALLY ON FREEWAYS WHERE DRIVERS GO 70-75MPH IN SEMI RIGS CAUSING VEHICLES NEAR THEM TO BE IN JEPARDY IS THEIR STEERING IS AS LOOSE AS FORD ALLOWS.",
