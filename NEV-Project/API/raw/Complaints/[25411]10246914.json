        "summary": "I OWN A 2003 DIAMANTE WITH ABOUT 60,000 MILES ON IT.  MY WINDOWS CONTINUALLY FOG UP WHILE DRIVING OR PARKED AND THE DEFROSTER/VENTS DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE FOG AT ALL, MAKING DRIVING VERY DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY IN RAINY WEATHER AND DURING THE NIGHTTIME. THE SMELL OF ANTIFREEZE IS EXTREMELY STRONG INSIDE THE VEHICLE.   I HAD A PROBLEM WITH MY TRANSMISSION SHIFTING AND THE LIGHT AROUND THE \"N\" ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL WAS FLASHING.  THE MECHANIC SAID MY HEATER CORE WAS  LEAKING COOLANT ONTO THE TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE CAUSING IT TO MALFUNCTION.  I WAS TOLD THAT EVEN THOUGH I PAID FOR AND HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON THIS VEHICLE IT WOULD NOT BE COVERED BECAUSE THE HEATER CORE LEAKING IS WHAT CAUSED THE TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE TO FAIL.  THE HEATER CORE WAS REPLACED ALONG WITH THE CONTROL MODULE AND THE RELAY WITH A COST OF OVER 2,500 DOLLARS.  IT SEEMS LIKE A PROBLEM LIKE THIS THAT IS EXTREMELY COMMON IS THESE VEHICLES, CREATES SAFETY AND HEALTH HAZARDS, AND VERY EXPENSIVE TO FIX SHOULD BE RECALLED AND COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.  *TR",
