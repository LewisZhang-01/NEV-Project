MY INTERNAL LIGHTS DO NOT WORK, MY INDICATOR LIGHTS DO NOT WORK. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MY FRM NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ONLINE I HAVE LEARNED THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM IN THE X5 SERIES. THE VEHICLE HAS LESS THAN 50,000 MILES ON IT AND I ONLY DRIVE IT ON THE WEEKENDS. THIS IS THE SECOND MAJOR MALFUNCTION THIS YEAR. THE WATER PUMP NEEDED REPLACEMENT IN FEBRUARY. I PURCHASED THIS CERTIFIED POS IN 2016 FROM THE MAMARONECK DEALERSHIP WITH 26000 ON THE VEHICLE. OH I FORGOT TO MENTION LESS THAN 6 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASING THE CASE THERE WAS AN OIL LEAK IN THE ENGINE. I CAN'T WAIT TO FINISH PAYING FOR THIS CAR SO I CAN GO BACK TO THE MORE RELIABLE MERCEDES BENZ THAT I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO.",
