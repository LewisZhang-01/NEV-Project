WHILE APPLYING BRAKES AND STEADILY APPLYING MORE PRESSURE TO INCREASE RATE OF DECENT, I GET A HARD PEDAL THAT YOU CAN'T PUSH ANY HARDER EVEN WITH BOTH FEET.  BRAKES WILL NOT APPLY ENOUGH PRESSURE TO ACTIVATE THE ABS EVEN ON WET PAVEMENT, ONLY ON GRAVEL OR SNOW.  I HAVE PAPERWORK FROM FORD STATING THEY HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS AND ARE \"AWARE OF THE SAFTEY CONCERN\" BUT ARE \"UNABLE TO FIX.\"  FORDS TECK LINE ADVISED TECHNITION TO \"REPLACE PARTS UNTILL CONCERN IS FIXED.\"  I'VE BEEN TO 4 DEALERS.  THEY HAVE REPLACED THE POWERBOOSTER AND PUT AFTERMARKET PADS ON THE FRONT WITH NO EFFECT.  WHEN I INQUIRED ABOUT THE LEMMON LAW AFTER SEVERAL RETURN TRIPS TO THE DEALER, THEY NOW SAY IT'S A \"PERCIEVED PROBLEM\", AND PRINT ON THE PAPERWORK \"NO CONCERNS NOTICED.\"  AT THE LAST TRIP TO THE DEALER THE TECH. SAID HE \"SAW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT AND TEST DROVE A NEW TRUCK TO COMPARE BUT SAID IT WAS THE SAME WAY.  THAT MEANS TO ME THAT THEY ARE STILL BUILDING THESE TRUCKS EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE FAILED TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  I FIRST RETURNED THE TRUCK WITH 3000 MILES.  I NOW HAVE 36,000 AND STILL NO BRAKES.  I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE IT WITH A LOAD.  SOMEONE FROM NHSTA OR SOMEONE INDEPENDENT OF FORD NEEDS TO TEST DRIVE THIS TRUCK.  PLEASE RESPOND.  FORD REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING.*AK",
