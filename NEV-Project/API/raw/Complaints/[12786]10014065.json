THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE NOISE IS TO DISCONNECT THE BATTERY OR REMOVE THE ABS 60 AMP FUSE.  DEALER INFORMS ME THE PART COSTS $875.00   IN CHECKING WITH USED PARTS SHOPS I FOUND THIS PART IS IN VERY HIGH DEMAND -- MUCH GREATER THAN THEY CAN SUPPLY. ONE USED PARTS DEALER TOLD ME THEY  HAD 18 REQUESTS THIS YEAR ALONE. THE CHEVROLET DEALER HESITATINGLY ADMITTED THEY REPLACE LOTS OF THESE.  WITH THE FUSE REMOVED THE VEHICLE IS DRIVABLE BUT WITHOUT THE ABS FUNCTION. THE DASH BOARD DOES HAVE INDICATORS CONSTANTLY LIT FOR BRAKES AND ABS.  *JB",
