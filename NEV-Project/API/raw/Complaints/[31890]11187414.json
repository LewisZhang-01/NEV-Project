SAT THERE FOR A FEW MINUTES WITH HAZARDS ON, CURSING MY LUCK AS I'VE ONLY HAD THIS JEEP FOR 5 HOURS AND HAD TO BE IN WORK IN 20 MIN. PRAYED AND STARTED THE JEEP RIGHT UP AND ON TO WORK.  COMING HOME SAME NIGHT DECIDED TO TAKE ON INTERSTATE TO SEE HOW IT WOULD DO AT 65-70 MPH AND HOLY MOLY THE STEERING WHEEL WAS VIBRATING LIKE ONE OF THE MASSAGE CHAIRS IN THE MALL.  COME TO FIND OUT ON FORUMS THAT JEEP OWNERS ARE AWARE OF THE GAS ISSUE (DEALER DOESN'T KNOW OR NEGLECTED TO TELL US) AS WE ARE FIRST TIME JEEP OWNERS.  THE VIBRATING STEERING WHEEL --- WELL THAT SEEMS TO BE A KNOWN ISSUE TOO, BUT OUR VIN DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ON THE RECALL LIST EVEN THOUGH I LIVE IN PA AND FALL INTO THE COVERED YEARS.  I AM BRINGING CAR BACK TO DEALERSHIP I PURCHASED FROM TO HAVE THEM CORRECT THE ISSUES.  WE HAVE A 30DAY 1000 MILE WARRANTY.  LETS SEE HOW MUCH OF A FUSS I HAVE TO MAKE OVER THIS.    FILLING GAS TANK AND STALLING OUT ON HIGHWAY I'D SAY THAT IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  VIBRATING STEERING WHEEL COULD FALL UNDER THE X69 EXTENDED WARRANTY---WILL KNOW MORE ON MONDAY.",
