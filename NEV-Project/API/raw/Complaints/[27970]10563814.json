LOOKED BOTH WAYS AND THEN BACK AT THE TRUCK. THE TRUCK DID NOT MOVE SO I PROCEEDED AND I ONLY MADE IT JUST BEYOND THE TURN LANE AND GOT HIT BY ANOTHER CAR. I TRIED AS FAST AS I COULD TO STAY IN THE TURN LANE BUT STILL GOT HIT. OTHER DRIVER DID NOT TRY TO AVOID US. WE WERE HIT HARD IN THE RIGHT FRONT OF OUR CAR. THE SPEED LIMIT ON THE ROAD I WANTED TO CROSS IS 55 MPH SO WE WERE HIT PRETTY HARD. NOW THIS IS WHERE WE GET MAD. OUR AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. MY WIFE AND I WERE SHAKEN VERY BAD. WE EACH HAVE A DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS AS WE ARE VERY SORE AND STIFF.  *TR",
