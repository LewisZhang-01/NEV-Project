SINCE I PURCHASED THE TRUCK THE THIRD DOOR HANDLE WOULD DEPRESS BUT WOULDN'T OPEN THE DOOR.  IT PARTIALLY UNLATCHES, BUT WON'T OPEN UNTIL I BUMP THE DOOR TO SECURE THE LATCH, THEN REPEAT THE PROCESS A SECOND TIME.  THE REPAIR WAS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY, BUT THE HANDLE WILL STILL ONLY OPEN THE DOOR ABOUT 50% OF THE TIME & FEELS AS THOUGH IT COULD BREAK OFF IN MY HAND EVERY TIME I USE IT.  I WAS INFORMED THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS MAKE OF VEHICLE.   *NLM",
