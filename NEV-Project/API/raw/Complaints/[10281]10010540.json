THE HOMELINK STARTS WORKING AGAIN.  7/2002--HOMELINK STARTS ACTING UP AGAIN--IT IS WORKING INTERMITTENTLY.  8/2002--HOMELINK TRANSCEIVER IS REPLACED AND IT STARTS WORKING AGAIN.  LATER THAT MONTH, IT BEGINS WORKING INTERMITTENTLY AGAIN.  9/2002--DEALER FINALLY INVESTIGATES FURTHER, AND FINDS CORROSION IN THE WIRING HARNESS/CONNECTORS.  THAT SOUNDS VERY STRANGE TO ME.  WHAT WAS THE CAR EXPOSED TO DURING PRODUCTION TO CAUSE THAT?  WHAT ELSE IS GOING TO FAIL/GIVE US PROBLEMS AS A RESULT?    *NLM",
