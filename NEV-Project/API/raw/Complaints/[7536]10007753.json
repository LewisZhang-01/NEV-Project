THE BRAKE LIGHT CAME ON, ABS WARNING LIGHT ALSO STAYED ON. WHEN I TOOK THE TRUCK IN TO BE REPAIRED I WAS THEN TOLD THE ANTI- LOCK BRAKE MODULE WAS BAD AND THE COST WOULD BE AROUND 1000 DOLLARS TO REPAIR. I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO REPAIR THE TRUCK. WHEN I CALLED CHEVROLET WITH THE PROMBLEM I WAS TOLD I WAS'NT THE FIRST WITH THE PROMBLEM BUT SINCE MY TRUCK WAS OUT OF WARRANTY IT WASNT CHEVROLET RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP WITH ANY OF THE REPAIR COSTS. I EVEN WENT AS FAR AND SUBMITTED A LETTER TO THE CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPTARTMENT, AND AGAIN WAS TOLD THAT IT CHEVROLET WOULD NOT TAKE RESPOSIBILITY FOR THE DEFECTIVE PART. I HAVE SINCE SPOKEN WITH SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE WHO OWN THE SAME STYLE TRUCK WITH MILAGE RANGING FROM 38000 TO 66000 ALL HAVE HAD THE SAME RESPONSE, THE TRUCKS ARE OUT OF WARRANTY AND CHEVROLET WOULD NOT HELP WITH THE REPAIR COSTS. I BELIEVE A PART OF THIS MAGNITUDE SHOULD NOT GO BAD IN SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.",
