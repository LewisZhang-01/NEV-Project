        "summary": "VEHICLE IS UNABLE TO START AFTER SHUTDOWN WITH NO DIAGNOSED CAUSE.  AFTER SUCCESSFUL SHUTDOWN (PARKED), VEHICLE WILL BE UNABLE TO BATTERY START, WITH LIGHTS AND DASHBOARD ELECTRONICS FLASHING AND STARTER UNABLE TO ENGAGE WHEN PRESSING START BUTTON WITH BRAKE PEDAL DEPRESSED.  VEHICLE REQUIRES JUMP START FOR SUCCESSFUL START UPON SYMPTOMS APPEARING.    VEHICLE HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO HONDA DEALERSHIPS SEVERAL TIMES FOR DIAGNOSIS AND SERVICE, BUT NO IDENTIFIABLE CAUSE HAS BEEN FOUND.  UPON LATEST VISIT, CAR WAS UNABLE TO START IMMEDIATELY AFTER PARKING CAR AT DEALERSHIP.  DEALERSHIP DIAGNOSED BATTERY (NORMAL, GR8, ED-18 TESTS) AND BOTH TESTS PASSED WITH NORMAL PARAMETERS.  DEALERSHIP PERFORMED PARASITIC DRAW TEST WITH NO ABNORMAL DRAW FOUND.  DEALERSHIP APPLIED HONDA TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN (TSB) 17-032 AND DID NOT FIX PROBLEM.    THIS PROBLEM OCCURS SEEMINGLY AT RANDOM INTERVALS AND WITH NO PATTERN TO WHAT COULD CAUSE THE BATTERY TO BE UNABLE TO START THE CAR.  PROBLEM APPEARS AFTER PARKING WITH OR WITHOUT PARKING BRAKE ENGAGED PRIOR TO SHUTDOWN, AFTER NO DRIVING ACTIVITY FOR SEVERAL WEEKS, AND ALSO AFTER DRIVING FOR SEVERAL HOURS PRIOR TO SHUTDOWN.  NO ACCESSORIES OR LIGHTS ARE LEFT ON OR PLUGGED IN TO THE CAR'S ELECTRICAL SYSTEM DURING PERIODS OF NO DRIVING ACTIVITY.    THIS PROBLEM SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS AN UNDIAGNOSED ISSUE WITH THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM ON THIS VEHICLE.  HONDA AT THIS TIME SEEMS UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO REMEDY THE ISSUE EVEN THOUGH IT PRESENTS A SAFETY ISSUE - THE INABILITY TO START/MOVE VEHICLE AFTER DRIVING.",
