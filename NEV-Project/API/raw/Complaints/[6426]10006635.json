        "summary": "I RENTED THIS TRUCK FROM ENTERPRISE, I WAS BLINDED BY AN ONCOMING 18 WHEELER AND RAN  INTO A BIG TRUCK THAT STOPPED IN FRONT OF ME.  THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS THE BRAKES LOCKED UP SENDING ME INTO THE OPPOSITE LANE WHERE AN 18 WHEELER WAS COMING AT ME.  I LET OFF THE BRAKES AND DID A CONTROLLED CRASH INTO THE TRUCK IN FRONT OF ME.  THE DRIVER SIDE AIR BAG DID NOT DEPLOY CAUSING ME GREAT PAIN AND  INJURIES THAT HAVE YET TO BE FULLY DETERMINED.  LAWYERS TOLD ME THAT SINE I WAS NOT KILLED I COULD NEVER WIN A BATTLE WITH THE AUTO MAKES SO ONCE AGAIN THE SMALL GUY GETS THE SHORT END OF THE STICK.  I JUST THOUGHT BY REPORTING THIS TOO YOU, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GET THIS INFORMATION OUT TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO OWN THIS KIND OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AND POSSIBLY SAVE A LIFE.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.    *JB    ***DIMSII IVOQ ENTRY POSTED AFTER 12/12/02 CUT-OVER TO ARTEMIS****770770",
