FURTHER INVESTIGATION SHOWED THE STABILIZER BAR WAS SHOVED AN INCH OUT OF IT'S BRACKET.  THERE WAS A HARD LEFT PULL WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN.  THE TRUCK WAS LIFTED OFF THE GROUND AND THE CONSUMER POINTED OUT THE RUB MARKS ON THE STABILIZER BAR AND ALSO SHOWED HOW THE BAR HAD BEEN SHOVED OUT OF IT'S HOLDING BRACKET.  THE SERVICE DEALER SUGGESTED THE PROBLEM WAS A DESIGN FLAW BY SHOWING THE CONSUMER ANOTHER VEHICLE (SAME MAKE/MODEL) WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  *SCC    *JB",
