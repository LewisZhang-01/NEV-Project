        "summary": "THE FRONT AIR BAGS IN MY WIFE'S 2002 HONDA ODYSSEY FAILED TO DEPLOY IN A HIGH SPEED COLLISION.  SHE SKID ON AND ICY I 470 BRIDGE OVER THE OHIO RIVER WESTBOUND IN WHEELING WV (WHEELING POLICE INCIDENT # 0303696).  AT 50 MPH, SHE SPUN AND HIT THREE SUBSEQUENT, FRONT-END IMPACTS TO THE CONCRETE SIDERAIL OF THE I 470 BRIDGE.  THE FRONT END IS EXTENSIVELY DAMAGED, INCLUDING SUPERSTRUCTURE.  THE \"FIRST THING THE OFFICER SAID\" (KATHY STOUT, DRIVER) WAS \"WOW, THE AIR BAGS DIDN'T GO OFF.\"  GENERAL MANAGER PAUL WINEMAN, OHIO VALLEY HONDA SAYS THAT HIS PEOPLE ARE NOT QUALIFIED TO ASSESS THE DAMAGE AND DETERMINE WHETHER THE AIRBAGS SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED.  HE TOLD ME ON THE PHONE YESTERDAY THAT \"HIS PLAN\" WAS TO HAVE SOMEONE FROM HONDA THAT WAS QUALIFIED LOOK AT IT, AND THAT HE WOULD CALL ME BACK, BUT IN 15 MINUTES OF CONVERSATION HE NEVER WOULD COMMIT TO THAT.  I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE THIS CAR AGAIN, AFTER REPAIRS, NOT KNOWING WHETHER THE AIR BAGS SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED OR NOT.   FURTHERMORE, THE BEST THE DEALERSHIP CAN DO IS HAVE UNQUALIFIED PERSONNEL RUN THE SYSTEM THROUGH A \"SIMULATOR\" TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT WILL, IN FACT, DEPLOY IN THE FUTURE.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, I DIDN'T SLEEP TOO WELL LAST NIGHT.  I CAN SEND PHOTOS IF THAT WOULD HELP.  I WONDER IF YOU CAN HELP.   *NLM",
