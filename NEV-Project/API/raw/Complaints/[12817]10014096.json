I'VE PREVIOUSLY HAVE HAD ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FIXED AFTER BEING BROUGHT IN NUMEROUS TIMES.  AFTER THE VEHICLE STALLED, IT WOULD MAKE AN EXTREMELY LOUD NOISE AND IT WOULD NOT SHUT BACK DOWN. THE SERVICE PEOPLE HAVE DONE NOTHING TO HELP THIS SITUATION. I'VE ALSO SPOKE WITH THE MANGER DAVE AND NOTHING IS BEING DONE. I BOUGHT THE TRUCK BRAND NEW AND IT HAS LESS THAN 30,000 MILES ON IT. I SPEND ALOT OF MONEY ON IT EVERY MONTH AND IT SHOULD NOT BE BREAKING DOWN ALREADY!   *NLM",
