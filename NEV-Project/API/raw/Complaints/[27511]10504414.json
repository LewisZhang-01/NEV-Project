WE WERE TOLD WE NEEDED A NEW HEAD GASKET. WE LEFT THE CAR WITH THE MECHANIC AND HE FOUND THAT 3 BOLTS FOR THE ENGINE BLOCK WERE LOOSE (HE COULD EASILY PULL THEM OUT WITH HIS HANDS AND THE THREADING CAME WITH THEM). HE HAD NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE SO HE LOOKED ONLINE AND FOUND THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM. THE CAR HAD ABOUT 109K MILES ON IT. LOOKING ON THIS SITE SHOWS THAT TOYOTA HAS A SERVICE BULLETIN ON IT.  *TR",
