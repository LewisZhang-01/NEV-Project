I DID CONTACT MY INSURANCE COMPANY, BUT SINCE THE CAR WAS NOT INSURED FOR FIRE. THEY RECOMMENDED I CONTACT FORD. WHEN ASKED IF THERE WERE ANY DEFECTS THAT WOULD CAUSE THE CAR TO BURST INTO FLAMES. I WAS TOLD NO THERE WAS NOT. SO THERE WAS IT WAS NOT INVESTIGATED. WHILE LOOKING OVER THIS WEB SITE I HAVE FOUND MANY FIRES. AND I WAS WONDER IF ANY ACTION COULD BE TAKEN. I DO NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S DAUGHTER DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND POSSIBLY BURNING TO DEATH. AND I FEEL FORD SHOULD HAVE BEEN HONEST WITH ME.
