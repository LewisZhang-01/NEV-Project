TOO MUCH PROPORTIONED TO THE FRONT BRAKES CAUSES WARPAGE AND SUDDEN VEHICLE JERK. A PROBLEM OCCURRING IN THE BRAKE SYSTEM IS AS SERIOUS AS IT GETS. A RECALL IS IN ORDER! THE SLIGHT COST OF REPLACING ABOVE MENTIONED COMPONENT IS NOMINAL COMPARED TO JUST 1 LIFE (I.E. 1 CONSUMER). I SINCERELY HOPE GM TAKES A HARD LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM THAT HAS EXISTED FOR NEARLY HALF A DECADE.   *NLM",
