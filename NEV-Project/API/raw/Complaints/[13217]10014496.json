CAUSED WATER TO LEAK IN AND CAUSE EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO SEAT, CARPET, PADDING. LEAKED TO UNDER FRONT PASSENGER SEAT,SHORTING OUT SENSOR AND DEPLOYED AIR BAG WITHOUT IMPACT. G.M. IS UNHELPFUL. THEY RESPONDED WITH \"EVEN IF IT WAS A FACTORY DEFECT I HAD EXCEEDED MY 6 YEAR/100,000 MILE WARRANTY. I CANNOT SEE HOW THIS COULD FALL TO THE CONSUMERS RESPONSIBILITY! I AM HOPEFUL THAT YOU MAY HAVE AN ANSWER THAT COULD BE OF SOME HELP.  I ALSO AM DUMBFOUNDED THAT AN AIR BAG WILL GO OFF WITH OUT IMPACT. EVERYTHING I HAVE RESEARCHED ON THEM REPORTS ONLY ON CRASHES, EVEN ON THE G.M.WEB PAGE FOR AIR BAGS THERE IS NOTHING THAT SAYS SHORTING OUT OF A SENSOR DUE TO WATER OR ANYTHING ELSE CAN DEPLOY THEM. SO I ASK WHAT IF A CHILD SPILLED A DRINK AND IT WENT UNDER THE SEAT? WHAT IF MY WIFE OR I PURCHASED A GALLON OF MILK OR WATER, SAT IT ON THE BACK FLOOR AND IT LEAKED? SHOULD THERE NOT BE A SENSOR  OR SOMETHING TO TELL THE AIR BAG NOT TO DEPLOY DUE TO THE FACT THE AUTO WASN'T IN AN ACCIDENT? THANK YOU, BRIAN AND LISA HEURING.            *JB",
