FORTUNATELY, I DID NOT HIT THE OTHER VEHICLE AND BUT HAD TO PULL OVER TO A PARKING LOT CHECK  ON MY FAMILY WHO WERE SHAKEN UP  ABOUT THE ORDEAL. I TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE FOR A FEW MINUTES TO SEE IF IT RESETS THE PROBLEM BUT AFTER STARTING THE VEHICLE AND DRIVING IT AROUND THE PARKING LOT A FEW TIMES, THE PROBLEM WAS STILL THERE AND A BRAKE ASSIST SERVICE MESSAGE WAS NOW SHOWING.",
