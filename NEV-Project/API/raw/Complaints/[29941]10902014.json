THIS HAPPENS ON CITY ROADS AND HIGHWAY.  NO DASHBOARD LIGHT INDICATED THERE WAS A PROBLEM. THE SERVICE ADVISOR AT DESTINATION KIA SAID MY MODEL DOES NOT COME WITH WARNING LIGHTS.   IT APPEARS TO BE AN OIL PROBLEM. OIL LEVEL GOES DOWN WITH NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF LEAKING. I ONLY HAVE 24,000 ON MY KIA SPORTAGE, WITH ONE YEAR LEFT ON MY LEASE. I AM NOT ABLE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE AS I AM IN FEAR OF STALLING IN TRAFFIC CAUSING MYSELF OR OTHERS TO BE INJURED.",
