AFTER ONLY 20,000 MILES WAS INFORMED THAT ALL 4 TIRES WERE COMPLETELY UNSAFE FOR DRIVING.  IF I HAD NOT HAD CAR SERVICED I WOULD HAVE DRIVEN NEW CAR AND WAS IN DANGER OF A FATAL ACCIDENT.  TIRES USUALLY ARE SAFE AT SUCH A SHORT AMOUNT OF MILES.  I WANT TO REPORT THIS TO YOU SO THAT OTHERS ARE ADVISED TO CHECK THEIR TOYOTA BRIDGESTONE TIRES.  IT COULD SAVE THEIR LIVES.  ALSO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE HAVE BEEN MANY ACCIDENTS DUE TO THESE TOYOTA BRIDGESTONE TIRES AND SHOULD TOYOTA STOP USING THEM ON THEIR CARS AND LET THEIR CURRENT CUSTOMERS KNOW TO HAVE THEIR TIRES CHECKED.  IT WAS THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP THAT DISCOVERED MY BADLY WORN AND UNSAFE TIRES.",
