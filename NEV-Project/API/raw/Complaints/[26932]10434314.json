        "summary": "AFTER RETURNING GROCERY SHOPPING I COULD NOT GET GROCERIES INTO BACK SEAT, DOOR WOULD NOT UNLOCK . THIS COULD HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR MONTHS AS I ALWAYS PUT GROCERIES IN FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AND FLOOR AND NEVER USED REAR DOORS . APPROXIMATELY 1-2 WEEKS LATER OTHER REAR PASSENGER DOOR WOULD NOT LOCK OR UNLOCK.   I CONTACTED DEALER WHO STATED GM MIGHT WORK WITH ME TO HELP A LITTLE BUT DOUBT IT AS MY MILEAGE WAS AT 42000 MILES. AFTER CHECKING ONLINE I FOUND NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS FROM MALIBU OWNERS THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED TO THEM AT 40,000 - 50,000 MILES AFTER THE WARRANTY IS OVER. THIS PROBLEM SHOULD BE COVERED BY GM AS IT SHOWS A DEFECT IN THE ACTUATER IN DOORS GO BAD, AS WELL AS A NEGLIGENT SAFETY HAZARD KNOWING MANY CARS HAVING THIS PROBLEM. IS IT GOING TOI TAKE SOMEONE TO DIE IN REAR SEATS DUE TO THIS DEFECT WHEN AN ACCIDENT OR FIRE OCCURS.  THIS IS A  HUGE SAFETY HAZARD AS CHILDREN IN THE BACK SEAT CANNOT OPEN DOOR IF THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT OR FIRE, AS WELL AS A POLICEMAN/FIREMAN/RESCUERER, CANNOT OPEN EITHER REAR DOORS FROM THE OUTSIDE. YOU HAVE TO CRAWL OVER AND SQEEZE IN BETWEEN FRONT SEATS AND HAVE ENTIRE BODY IN BACK SEATS BEFORE YOU CAN REACH THE DOOR LOCKS TO MANUALLY OPEN THEM.  THIS IS GOING TO COST ME APPROX $400-$500.00 FOR REAR DOORS AND READING OTHER CUSTOMERS THIS COULD EVENTUALLY APPLY TO ALL DOORS INCLUDING FRONT DOORS (ANOTHER $400-$500.00). THIS IS MY FIRST CHEVY I PURCHASED BRAND NEW AND WILL PROBABLY MY LAST.  *TR",
