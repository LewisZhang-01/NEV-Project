THIS IS A COSTLY REPAIR, THE FIRST TIME IT COST ME $1,600.00 TO REPLACE A $44.00 PART BECAUSE THE WHOLE TRANSMISSION HAD TO BE OVERHAULED.  THE TRANSMISSION IN THE CHEVY IS MADE WITH INFERIOR PARTS AND SHOULD BE RECALLED TO HAVE ALL THE GEARS REPLACED.  I HAVE ALSO HAD TO REPLACE BOTH FRONT WHEEL HUBS AND A MOTOR.  THE S1-S OF THIS ERA NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED AND THE CONSUMER SHOULD BE PROTECTED!!  *NM",
