ALMOST NEVER WHEN DRIVING DIRECTLY FORWARD, BUT OFTEN WHEN TURNING. DEALER MADE 4 (FOUR) REPAIR ATTEMPTS AND STILL HAS NOT GOTTEN IT RIGHT. NOT 2 MONTHS AFTER LAST REPAIR, WHICH TOOK SIX WEEKS TO GET ALL THE PARTS TOGETHER (DURING WHICH THE LEMON LAW COVERAGE FOR MY CAR EXPIRED - GO WONDER ABOUT THAT..) THE NOISES HAVE RETURNED AGAIN.  OTHER ISSUES, I HAVE SEEN 6 TOTAL ISSUES MENTIONED IN THIS SITE THAT I CAN IDENTIFY WITH.  AS FOR THOSE SUDDEN ACCELERATIONS SOME HAVE MENTIONED, YES I AGREE THE PEDALS ARE TOO CLOSE WHICH MAKES IT EASY TO MASH BOTH BRAKE & GAS PEDALS.       *JB",
