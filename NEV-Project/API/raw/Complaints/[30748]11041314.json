THE LETTER MAKERS IT APPEAR AS THOUGH THIS IS A SERIOUS, LIFE-THREATENING ISSUE, BUT I HAVE CALLED SEVERAL FORD DEALERSHIPS OVER THE LAST YEAR AND THEY ALL CLAIM THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE THE PARTS OF TAKATA TO FIX IT.     TODAY I RECEIVED A LETTER INFORMING ME THAT TAKATA HAS FILED CHAPTER 11 AND THAT I REALLY NEED TO GET IT RESOLVED. I CALLED A DEALERSHIP TODAY AND THEY ONCE AGAIN CLAIMED NOT TO HAVE THE PARTS. WHAT IS THE POINT OF SENDING ME ALL OF THESE WARNINGS IF I CANT GET IT FIXED? IF THE POINT IS THAT I SHOULDNT BE DRIVING MY CAR UNTIL ITS FIXED THEN THEY SHOULD BE GIVING ME A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE.",
