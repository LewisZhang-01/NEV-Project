AFTER THE CAR WAS DRIVEN HOME (WITHIN 5 MILES), THE DRIVER NOTICE A FLAT TIRE SHORT TIME LATER.  I WENT TO VOLVO'S DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT ON 6/25/03 TO SEE IF I CAN GET SOME ASSISTANCE OR EXPLAINATION ON THE CAUSES OF MY TIRE PROBLEMS. THE SAME THING HAPPENED 2 TIMES BEFORE ON THE OTHER TIRES. I WAS SURPRISED HOW LITTLE HELP I GOT FROM THE SERVICE CONSULTANT WORKING THERE. IT APPEARS THAT THEY DON'T EVEN CARE TO HEAR OR DISCUSS MY PROBLEMS. LATER ON, I FIND OUT INFORMATION FROM NHTSA THAT OTHER DRIVERS ALSO EXPERIENCED PROBLEMS WITH PIRELLI P6. SINCE I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING ON THESE FACTORY INSTALLED TIRES, I DECIDE TO REPLACE THEM THE FOLLOWING DAY.*AK",
