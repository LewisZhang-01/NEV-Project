        "summary": "I WENT TO MY MECHANIC. HE WAS ABLE TO GET A TEMP HMD REPLACEMENT PART IN ABOUT 3 DAYS. HE INSTALLED THE TEMP REPLACEMENT PART AND EXPLAINED TO ME WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DISFUNCTIONING HDM. THAT WAS IN 07/2014.MY BUICK WAS IN THE RECALL FOR THE HDM MALFUNCTION. UPON RECEIVING THE RECALL LETTER, I TOOK MY BUICK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS INFORMED THERE WERE NO REPLACEMENT PARTS AVAILABLE AT THAT MOMENT. I SHOULD CHECK BACK OR RECEIVE A PHONE CALL FROM THE DEALERSHIP WHEN SAID PART WOULD BE AVAILABLE. I EXPLAINED THAT THE PART WAS REPLACED PRIOR TO THE GM RECALL. THE RECALL NOTICE WAS ON 01/2015 FROM GLOBAL VEHICAL SAFETY IN MILWAUKEE, WI. AS FAR AS THE DEALERSHIP, I NEVER HEARD ANYTHING BACK FROM THEM. ON 10/27/2015, I SUBMITTED A REIMBURSEMENT CLAIM FOR OUT OF POCKET PAY ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS STATED ON THAT FORM, TO THE DEALERSHIP. AFTER 3 MONTHS OF NO RESPONSE FROM THE DEALERSHIP, I WENT IN AND TALKED TO THEM DIRECTLY. THEY STATED THAT A PERM REPLACEMENT PART WAS NOT AVAILABLE YET SO MY CLAIM WOULD NOT BE PROCESSED UNTIL GM ANNOUCED A PART WAS AVAILABLE AND A SECOND LETTER WAS MAILED TO ME. ANOTHER 2 MONTHS PASSED AND NO CALLS OR LETTERS FROM GM OR THE DEALERSHIP. I WENT IN DIRECTLY TO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN AND THEY SAID THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR AN \"OFFICIAL\" AUTHORIZATION FROM GM TO START THE CLAIM PROCESS. I FEEL AS IF GM AND THE DEALERSHIP ARE NOT WORKING ON THIS MATTER TO THE FULLEST OR EVEN ANY EFFORT TO RESOLVE THIS SITUATION. IT'S FUNNY YET SAD THAT MY MECHANIC REPLACED THE HDM IN ROUGHLY 5 DAY OR SO, WHICH BY THE WAY, IS STILL PERFORMING PERFECTLY FINE. YET THIS MAJOR AUTO COMPANY(GM) CANT RESOLVE THIS ISSUE WITH THE HDM PART. REALLY?!  SOMEONE NEEDS TO TAKE A CLOSER INTO THIS SITUATION. I ,PERSONALLY, FEEL AS IF GM AND THE DEALERSHIP ARE TRYING TO TURN AWAY FROM THIS \"MAJOR\" PROBLEM SO MANY ARE EFFECTED BY.(UPDATE-MRS ALLAI PASSED AWAY 11/2015. I AM HER SON)",
