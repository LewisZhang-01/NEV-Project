WHEN WE SPOKE WITH THE CHEVROLET DEALER ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, ALL THEY WOULD SAY IS THAT THEY ARE AWARE THAT IT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM, BUT IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY.   BUT THEY WOULD BE HAPPY TO CHECK IT FOR US FOR A NOMINAL SUM OF $150.00 PLUS ANY PARTS.  IF THIS WAS LISTED ON A SERVICE ADVISORY, BUT AS YET I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY RECALL.  THIS IS A ONGOING PROBLEM, TODAY I HAD TO PUT THE TRUCK IN PARK AND LITERALLY STOMP ON THE GAS PEDAL MORE THAN 6 TIMES BEFORE IT WOULD FINALLY BREAK LOOSE AND RELEASE.  I REFER TO YOUR TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS 000604007 # 126 AND 000604007B, #191.   *NLM",
