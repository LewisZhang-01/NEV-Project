NOW TWO LOCAL MECHANICS TELL ME THAT MY VEHICLE'S BRAKE PADS COVER LESS THAN 50% OF THE ROTOR, CAUSING SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BRAKING CAPABILITY. THE ROOT CAUSE APPEARS TO BE THAT THE VEHICLE HAS 14\" ROTORS ON TRUCKS DESIGNED FOR 15\" ROTORS (AND 15\" WHEELS). THE RESULT IS THAT THE BRAKE SYSTEM WEARS OUT QUICKLY AND, IN THE OPINION OF MY LOCAL GOODYEAR DEALERSHIP, PRESENTS A SEVERE SAFETY HAZARD. THE GOODYEAR DEALER ACTUALLY TOLD ME THAT HE WOULD NOT RECOMMEND DRIVING THE VEHICLE.",
