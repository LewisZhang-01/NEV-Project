        "summary": "I RECENTLY HAD A VENT ACTUATOR FAIL; THE SIGN WAS A LOUD CLICKING NOISE COMING FROM THE FAILED VENT ACTUATOR LOCATED BEHIND THE GLOVE BOX. ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GATHER, THERE ARE 4 VENT ACTUATORS LOCATED BEHIND THE DASH OF THE VEHICLE. THESE VENT ACTUATORS SEEM TO FAIL ON A REGULAR BASIS FROM COMPLAINTS THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REVIEW ON THE INTERNET. THESE ARE $25 PARTS, HOWEVER THE LABOR COSTS ARE RIDICULOUS; $300-400 PER VENT ACTUATOR. IF THESE VENT ACTUATORS FAIL AT RANDOM TIMES, THAT IS AT A COST OF UP TO $425 FOR EACH VISIT TO THE DEALER, AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THEY WON'T FAIL ONCE AGAIN. CHEVROLET IS FULLY AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN WEB SITE. HOWEVER, THEY CONTINUE TO CHARGE THE OWNER OF THE VEHICLE THESE OUTRAGEOUS FEES. I AM SEEKING ASSISTANCE IN HAVING CHEVROLET REPLACE ALL THE VENT ACTUATORS WITH A QUALITY PRODUCT; NOTHING LIKE CHEAP CHINESE PLASTIC. IN ADDITION, THEY NEED TO QUIT PASSING THE LABOR COSTS ONTO THE OWNER FOR A PROBLEM THAT THEY REFUSE TO ADDRESS.",
