THIS HAS HAPPENED ABOUT SIX TIMES IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS, INCLUDING ONCE WHILE PULLING A 30 FT. CAMPER. I NEARLY LOST CONTROL ON A WET ROAD ON A HILL IN PA. IT HAS BEEN TO THE DEALER 3 TIMES. THEY REFUSED TO REPLACE ANY PARTS BECAUSE NO CODES SHOW UP WHEN IS PUT ON THE DIAGNOSTIC MACHINE. THE PROBLEM GOES AWAY AFTER LEAVING THE ENGINE OFF FOR A FEW MINUTES. IT HAS NOT FAILED NEAR ENOUGH TO HOME AND WHEN THE DEALER WAS OPEN. I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A FATAL ACCIDENT BEFORE THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED.",
