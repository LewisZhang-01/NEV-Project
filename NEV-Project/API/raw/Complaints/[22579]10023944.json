UPON CONTACTING THE LOCAL DEALERSHIPS PARTS DEPARTMENT TO ORDER NEW OEM SEAT BELT LATCH ASSEMBLIES I LEARNED THAT THIS PART FOR THIS TRUCK IS ON A \"NATIONAL BACK-ORDER\" WITH NO EXPECTED SHIP DATE.  THIS SEEMS TO INFER THAT THIS PART IS IN HIGH DEMAND, THUS MEANING THERE IS MOST LIKELY A PROBLEM THAT ORIGINATES AT THE MANUFACTURER.  THIS LATCH ASSEMBLY HAS BEEN INOPERABLE ON MY TRUCK FOR ALMOST (1) YEAR NOW, AND I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET THE OEM PART FOR THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME.   *NLM",
