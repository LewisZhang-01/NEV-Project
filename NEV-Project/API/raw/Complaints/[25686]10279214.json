ALTHOUGH THE COVER IT'S SELF DOES NOT WEIGH ENOUGH TO CAUSE INJURY, IT IS A SIGNIFCANT DISTRACTION WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE LOSS OF CONTROL.  BOTH BIKES HAVE BEEN TO THE DEALER SEVERAL TIMES FOR REPAIRS, UNFORTINATLY THE REPAIR PARTS ARE ON BACK ORDER.  CONTINUED DIFFICULTY IN GETTING THE COVER TO STAY CLOSED ON THE 08 BIKE CAUSED THE DEALER TO REMOVE THE COVER AS A TEMPORARY FIX UNTIL THE REPAIR PARTS CAN BE HAD.  THIS MODIFICATION HAS RESULTED IN THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS BEING EXPOSED.  THE 09 BIKE IS NOW GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE THE COVER WON'T STAY CLOSED FOR MORE THAN 15 MINUTES AT A TIME. *TR",
