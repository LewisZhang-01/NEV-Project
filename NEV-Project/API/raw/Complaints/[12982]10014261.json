THE DEALER HAS BEEN TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM, AN HAS THUS FAR REPLACED THE MASTER CYLINDER. THE PROBLEM STILL EXISTS INTERMITTENTLY, AND CAUSING THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKE PUMP TO CYCLE (LOCKING THE BRAKES) ALLEVIATES THE LOW OR FADING PEDAL FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.  THIS PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE RELATED TO THE ABS PUMP AND/OR THE COMPUTER CONTROLLING IT. I AM VERY EXPERIENCED IN DIAGNOSTICS AND REBUILDING AUTOMOBILES, AND HAVE SEEN THIS OCCUR ON OTHER MAKES AND MODELS (USUALLY A FAILURE OF THE ABS PUMP).  MY CAR WILL BE BACK AT THE DEALER AGAIN ON TUESDAY APRIL 14TH FOR THIS ON GOING FAILURE OF THIS POORLY DESIGNED ABS.  MAYBE MY GOVERNMENT WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS WHEN THE BRAKES ON THIS VEHICLE KILL SOME INNOCENT CITIZEN OR GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE DRIVING ONE OF THESE CARS. *JB",
