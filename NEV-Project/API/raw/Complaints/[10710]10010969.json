THE 1991 HAS NUMEROUS PROBLEMS, INCLUDING A BACK HATCH THAT WON'T STAY UP BECAUSE THE AREA OF THE FRAME THAT THE SHOCK LATCHES INTO IS BROKEN DUE TO A STRESS CRACK.. THIS MAKES IT REALLY HARD TRYING TO GET THINGS IN AND OUT WHEN YOU HAVE A BABY.. THE DRIVER SEAT ALSO FALLS BACKWARDS AND DOES NOT STAY IN PLACE. THE GAUGES DO NOT WORK, WITH NO KNOWN CAUSE...  BOTH THESE VEHICLES ARE WHITE IN COLOR AND THE PAINT IS PEELING IN THE SAME EXACT SPOTS ON BOTH VANS. IT'S ACROSS THE HOOD AND ACROSS THE TOP.   ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS, BECAUSE OF THESE PROBLEMS - I HATE MY VANS AND PROBABLY WON'T EVER PURCHASE ANOTHER CARAVAN.  *JB",
