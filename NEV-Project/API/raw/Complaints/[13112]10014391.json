THE ABS LIGHT CAME ON AND WOULD NOT GO OFF AND A HUMMING COULD BE HEARD UNDER THE VEHICLE. I SHUT IT OFF AND IT WOULD NOT STOP. I UNPLUGGED THE ABS MODULE AND IT WENT QUITE. WE TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE CHEVROLET DEALER ON MONDAY AND THEY TOLD US THE ABS MODULE HAD FAILED AND IT WOULD COST US ABOUT $900.00 TO REPLACE IT. THEY CHECKED WITH CHEVROLET TO SEE IF THEY WOULD WARRANTY ANY OF THE PART AND THEY SAID SINCE THE TRUCK WAS OVER 2 YEARS OLD THEY WOULD NOT MAKE GOOD ON ANY OF THE COST. HE TOLD US IT WAS A POOR DESIGN AND THEY HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THESE GOING OUT. THIS APPARENTLY SHOULD BE A RECALL BUT SOME ONE IN THE RIGHT PLACES MUST BE KEEPING IT FROM HAPPENING. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A GM PREFERRED PERSON BUT I AM BEGINNING TO HAVE MY DOUBTS.*JB",
