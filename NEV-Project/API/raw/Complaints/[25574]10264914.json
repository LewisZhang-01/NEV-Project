I HAD A ONE VEHICLE WRECK AND BROKE A RIB RECENTLY IN THE LARGE 2 ACRE PARKING LOT OF THE MOTORCYCLE DEALER WHERE I PURCHASE A NEW 2007 YAMAHA VMAX MOTORCYCLE THAT IS UNDER WARRANTY.  I WAS TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE A DEFECT ON THE FRONT FORK AND THE FRAME.  THE MECHANIC AT THE SHOP HAD BEEN UNABLE TO FIND THE DEFECT.  THE DEFECT ON MY MOTORCYCLE IS MAINLY IN THE FRONT FORK.  AS I HAD TOLD THE MECHANIC THE FRONT FORK WOBBLES WHEN GOING AROUND A SLIGHT CURVE OR BEND IN A HIGHWAY GOING BETWEEN 30 AND 55.  I DON'T THINK THEY WANT TO FIX IT AND SOMEONE IS GOING TO DIE IF I SELL IT THE WAY IT IS.  I'VE ALREADY BOUGHT A DIFFERENT MOTORCYCLE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO RIDE THE DEFECTIVE ONE.  IT IS STILL IN THE DEALERS SHOP.  I AM A 53 YEAR OLD COLLEGE EDUCATED, MILITARY VET.  I COULDN?T DEMONSTRATE TO THE MECHANIC HOW THE FRONT END SHAKES AND WOBBLES IN A SLIGHT CURVE IN THE ROAD WHEN GRIPPING THE HANDLEBARS TIGHTLY SO I HAD TO GRIP THE HANDLEBARS LIGHTLY AND LET THE FRONT END SHAKE GOING STRAIGHT AT AROUND 30 TO 50 MPH IN THE PARKING LOT SO THAT THE MECHANIC COULD SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.  WHEN MY BROKEN RIB HEALS I?M GOING TO GO TO THE MOTORCYCLE DEALER?S SHOP AND GET THE BIKE AND VIDEOTAPE THE SHAKING FRONT FORK IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT SITUATIONS.  I FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THE MECHANIC DIDN'T FIND WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.  I THINK THAT THIS IS A KNOWN DEFECT THAT YAMAHA AND YAMAHA DEALERSHIPS DON'T WANT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR.  IF THE MOTORCYCLE WOBBLE IS NOT FIXED THEN WHEN I SELL IT I DO BELIEVE SOMEONE WILL QUITE POSSIBLY DIE TRYING TO RIDE IT. *TR",
