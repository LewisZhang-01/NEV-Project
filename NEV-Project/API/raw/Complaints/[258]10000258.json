THIS HAS RESULTED IN MY CAR BREAKING DOWN THREE TIMES. IT EITHER SPONTANISLY (SP) LOSES POWER OR LOSES ALL POWER AND THE CAR SHAKES. THIS IS POTENTIALLY DEADLY IN HIGH TRAFFIC SITUATIONS. VW NORTH AMERICA IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, BUT REFUSES TO REPLACE ALL 4 COILS. THEY WILL ONLY REPLACE THEM AS THEY FAIL. THIS MEANS THAT FOR THOUSANDS OF OWNERS, THEY EACH HAVE FOUR CHANCES TO BE INVOLVED IN A WRECK WHEN THE ENGINE FAILS.",
