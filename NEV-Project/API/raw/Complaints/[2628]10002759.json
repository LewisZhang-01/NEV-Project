LUCKILY , I HAVEN'T WRECKED YET OR KILLED ANYONE BUT NOBODY WILL RIDE WITH ME NOW. I'D LIKE THIS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF BY ME GETTING ANOTHER VEHICLE IN THE SAME STYLE AND MODEL. IT HAS BEEN IN THE GARAGE , THIS TIME FOR 9 DAYS AND THEY STILL GOT IT. I NEED A VEHICLE !  I WAS HOPING FOR THIS MUCH MONEY IT WOULD LAST LONGER THAN THIS.",
