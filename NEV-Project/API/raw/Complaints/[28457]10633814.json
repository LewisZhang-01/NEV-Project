I GOOGLED THE PROBLEM AND IMMEDIATELY FOUND OUT THAT THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR MY VEHICLE. THE TIPM (TOTALLY INTEGRATED POWER MODULE) IS FAULTY. HAVE HAD IT DIAGNOSED AT A DEALER, CHARGED ME $102 TO TELL ME WHAT I ALREADY KNEW. TOLD ME THERE ARE 75 TIPM'S ON BACKORDER AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHEN I WILL GET ONE. MEANWHILE, SINCE THIS IS A HANDICAP VEHICLE FOR MY 14 YEAR OLD CHILD WHO IS A PARAPLEGIC, I HAVE TO RELY ON MY FOG LIGHTS TO GET HER TO SCHOOL AT 6:45 IN THE MORNING. I NEED THIS VEHICLE. I CAN'T JUST RUN OUT AND GET A RENTAL UNTIL THIS IS RESOLVED LIKE OTHERS CAN. THERE ARE NO HANDICAP VEHICLE RENTALS. NUMEROUS OTHER PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING A VARIETY OF PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIPM IN THEIR VEHICLES AND I AM CONCERNED THAT MY VEHICLE WILL BEGIN TO DEVELOP SOME OF THOSE PROBLEMS AS WELL ON TOP OF MY SERIOUSLY FRUSTRATING HEADLIGHT ISSUE. IF I HAVE A NIGHTTIME EMERGENCY WITH MY CHILD I WONT BE ABLE TO USE MY VEHICLE. SCARY TO SAY THE LEAST.  *TR",
