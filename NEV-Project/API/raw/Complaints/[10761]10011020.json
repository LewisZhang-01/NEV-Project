HE TURNED OFF THE IGNITION WENT INTO HIS HOME. JUST 10 MINTUES LATER HIS WIFE SAW SMOKE COMING BY THE WINDOW. THEY IMMEDIATELY WALKED OUTSIDE AND SAW THE CAR COMPLETELY ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THEY CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT TO PUT OUT THE FIRE BUT THE CAR BURNED TO THE GROUND. THE FIRE DAMAGED THE OUTER VINYL SIDING ON 2 SIDES OF THE HOUSE, DAMAGED A BRAND NEW CARPORT, COMPLETELY BURNED  A 2 YEAR OLD RIDING LAWN MOWER AND DESTROYED A STORAGE BUILDING WITH OVER $2,000 IN PERSONAL BELONGINGS. I HAVE NEVER SEEN A CAR BURN THAT QUICKLY AND WITH THAT MUCH FORCE. IT WAS THE SCARIEST DAY OF MY LIFE.IF MY BROTHER AND HIS WIFE  HAD DRIVEN 10 MORE MINUTES THEY  WOULDN'T BE HERE WITH ME TODAY.  I SHUDDER THE THOUGHT THAT SOMEWHERE THERE ARE PEOPLE STILL DRIVING 1993 PONTIACS WITH THEIR LIVES AT RISK ALSO.",
