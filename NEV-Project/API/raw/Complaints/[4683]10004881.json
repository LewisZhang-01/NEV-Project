BRAKES BEGAN TO CATCH AND THEN FAILED COMPLETELY BEFORE I COULD GET HOME OR TO THE DEALERSHIP.  NO ACCIDENT, DUE COMPLETELY TO LUCK.  CAR WAS TOWED TO DEALER.  DEALER REPLACED THE MASTER CYLINDER.  GOT CAR BACK AND IN LESS THAN 2 WEEKS ABS LIGHT AGAIN ON WHILE DRIVING.  THIS TIME NO CATCHING OF ANTI-LOCK BRAKES.  RETURNED TO DEALER FOR REPAIR.  ANOTHER PART REPLACEMENT.  LESS THAN 1 WEEK LATER THE ABS LIGHT ON AGAIN DURING DRIVING.  DEALER IS NOW NOT CALLING ME, I HAVE TO CALL.  HAS HAD CAR FOR 3 BUSINESS DAYS.  SAY THEY HAVE FIXED THE CAR AND ARE KEEPING IT SO THEY CAN TEST DRIVE IT.  THEY HAVE REPLACED THE SENSOR.  DOES THIS MEAN THE ABS LIGHT WILL NOT COME ON WHEN THERE IS A PROBLEM?",
