I HAVE HAD IT INTO THE DEALER SEVEN TIMES FOR THE SAME PROBLEM AND I STILL HAVE A VERY DANGEROUS VEHICLE.  I ALSO HAVE NUMEROUS OTHER PROBLEMS WITH RATTLES AND SQUEAKS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FIXED.  THIS TRUCK IS DEFINITELY A TRUE LEMON.  THE DEALER HAS BLAMED THE PROBLEM ON TIRES, STEERING BOX, ETC., BUT NOTHING HAS FIXED THE PROBLEM.  THE LAST STATEMENT FROM THE DEALER IS THAT THIS STEERING PROBLEM IS INHERENT TO THE DODGE DIESEL ENGINES AND CANNOT BE FIXED.  I ALMOST HAD A HEAD ON COLLISION ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND HAVE SINCE PARKED MY TRUCK.  I AM NOW DRIVING AN OLDER VEHICLE UNTIL I CAN GET THIS RESOLVED.  I WILL NOT RISK THE LIVES OF MY FAMILY IN THIS TRUCK ANYMORE.  I PAID $40,000 FOR A TRUCK I CANNOT DRIVE.*JB",
