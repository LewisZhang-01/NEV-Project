        "summary": "THE PARKING BRAKE ON MY 2000 YUKON WOULD NOT HOLD THE VEHICLE WHEN THE PARKING BRAKE WAS APPLIED AND THE TRANSMISSION WAS IN NEUTRAL.  THIS CONDITION EXISTED WHEN I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE NEW.  WHEN I TOOK IT BACK TO HAVE THE PROBLEM FIXED, I WAS TOLD THIS VEHICLE HAS A NEW TYPE PARKING BRAKE.  IT WAS NOT DESIGNED TO HOLD THE VEHICLE WITH THE TRANSMISSION IN NEUTRAL.  IT WOULD ONLY HOLD THE VEHICLE WITH THE TRANSMISSION IN PARK.  AFTER TWO YEARS OF THE PARKING BRAKE NOT HOLDING I HAD IT IN FOR SERVICE AND INQUIRED ONE MORE TIME ABOUT THE PARKING BRAKE.  THE DEALER CHECKED IT AND TOLD ME THE BRAKE PADS WERE WORN OUT AND NEED TO BE REPLACED.  THE DEALER REPLACED THE PADS AND MADE SOME OTHER CHANGES.  NOW THE PARKING BRAKE DOES HOLD THE VEHICLE WITH THE TRANSMISSION IN NEUTRAL.  I FEEL I HAVE BEEN DECEIVED AND TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SINCE THE DEALER TOLD ME THERE WAS NO PROBLEM UNTIL THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE HAS BEEN OTHER COMPLAINTS OF THIS TYPE.  JB",
