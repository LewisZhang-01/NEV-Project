THIS PROBLEM USUALLY OCCURS WHILE DRIVING DOWN HILLS BUT WILL SOMETIMES HAPPEN ON LEVEL ROADS.  THE CAR WILL SOMTIMES DO THIS UP TO 6 TIMES BEFORE GOING BACK TO DRIVING LIKE NORMAL.  THIS PROBLEM HAPPENS WITH THE CAR IN EITHER OVER-DRIVE OR DRIVE.  TOYOTA CORPORATE AND THE DEALERSHIP WHERE THE CAR WAS PURCHASED ARE UNWILLING TO DO ANYTHING FURTHER TO ALLEVIATE THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE THEY FEEL IT IS A \"NORMAL CHARACTERISTIC\" OF THE VEHICLE.",
