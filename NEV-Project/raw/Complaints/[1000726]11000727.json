I ALSO LIVE IN THE \"SALT BELT\" BEING IN KANSAS, I LIVE 20 MILES FROM THE STATE OF MO. I AM HAVING THE EXACT PROBLEM AS THE RECALL - 05V379000. I WISH I KNEW WHO I COULD CONTACT TO AID ME IN SOLVING THIS PROBLEM. IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS RESULTS IN A CRASH DUE TO CONSTANT CORROSION. IF YOU LOOK AT STATISTICS OF KANSAS CITY. WE ARE EQUIVALENT TO KANSAS CITY MO. I'M FEELING VERY FRUSTRATED ABOUT THIS.",
