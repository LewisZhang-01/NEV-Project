WINNEBAGO HAS ISSUED A RECALL BUT IT IS NOT ON YOUR SITE.  I WAS TOLD TO REMOVE A ACCESS MODULE THAT WAS SHORTING THE ENTIRE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.  THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THE ENTIRE UNIT WAS AFFECTED BY THIS MODULE PROBLEM.  THE STEERING PHONE AND VOLUME CONTROLS NO LONGER WORK.  I HAVE TO AVERT MY EYES TO THE CENTER OF THE UNIT WHILE DRIVING TO CONTROL VOLUME AND PHONE.  THIS IS YET ANOTHER SAFETY ISSUE.  WINNEBAGO IS DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT.*DT*JB",
