THE TEMPORARY REMEDY WAS TO NOT ALLOW ANY PASSENGERS TO RIDE IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT UNTIL THE AIRBAG HAD BEEN REPLACED.  I LEARNED OF THE AVAILABILITY OF THE REPLACEMENT PARTS IN JUNE OF 2017 WHEN I CALLED FOR A THIRD TIME TO PURSUE THE REMEDY.  IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE PARTS HAD BECOME AVAILABLE IN MAY OF 2017, AND I WAS NOTIFIED OF THE REMEDY BY TOYOTA IN JULY OF 2017.  A FULL CALENDAR YEAR IS AN UNACCEPTABLE DELAY FOR A SAFETY RECALL, AND EXPECTING TOYOTA OWNERS TO NOT USE THEIR FRONT PASSENGER SEATS FOR A YEAR IS RIDICULOUS.  I AM AWARE OF OTHER CAR COMPANIES THAT SENT A SIMILAR RECALL NOTICE AND OFFERED THE REMEDY WITHIN TWO WEEKS.  I HAVE NOW HAD THE SERVICE COMPLETED.",
