        "summary": "I HAVE HAD THE CAR FOR 2 YEARS AND HAVE HAD AT LEAST 10+ INCIDENTS OF MY CAR LOSING ALL POWER FOR ACCELERATION.  IT HAS HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY GOING 65+, IT HAS HAPPENED ACCELERATING ONTO THE HIGH WAY, IT HAS HAPPENED ON RESIDENTIAL STREETS, IT HAS HAPPENED ON STATE HIGHWAYS, IT HAS HAPPENED IN PARKING LOTS.  THE CAR SUDDENLY REVS SUPER HIGH BUT PRESSING THE ACCELERATOR DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  I HAVE TO LIMP TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, TURN THE CAR OFF AND USUALLY IT FIXES THE ISSUE.  BUT SEVERAL TIMES I HAVE HAD TO TURN IT OFF AND RESTART SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE I HAVE NORMAL CONTROL OF THE CAR AGAIN.  I HAVE BROUGHT IT IN SEVERAL TIMES AND EVERY TIME THEY TELL ME UNLESS IT IS HAPPENING AT THAT MOMENT THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM.  I HAVE KIDS IN MY CAR MOST OF THE TIME AND TO SUDDENLY LOSE POWER IS A TRAGEDY WAITING TO HAPPEN.  TODAY DURING A ROUTINE OIL CHECK, IT WAS DISCOVERED MY PTU IS LEAKING.  IN A 5 YEAR OLD CAR I WOULD NOT EXPECT THIS TO BE THE CASE.",
