NOW, IN NOVEMBER OF 2019, MY MECHANIC SAYS IT HAS TO HAVE ANOTHER NEW TRANSMISSION.  I OWN 4 DIFFERENT GM SUV'S, 2 YUKONS AND 2 SUBURBANS.  ONE YUKON IS 2015, ONE SUBURBAN AND ONE YUKON ARE 2016, AND ONE SUBURBAN IS 2017.  EACH DIFFERENT GM VEHICLE HAS HAD TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE NEW TRANSMISSION ALMOST EACH YEAR...AND EACH NEW TRANSMISSION FAILS AFTER ABOUT 110K MILES..SLIGHTLY OUT OF THE REACH OF MY WARRANTY.  THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN, AND GM WILL NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.",
