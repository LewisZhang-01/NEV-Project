DID THIS SEVERAL TIMES UNTIL WE REACHED FORD DEALER. THEY FOUND FUEL SYSTEM MINI FUSE HAD MELTED IN FUSE PANEL. WITH VERY LITTLE RESEARCH FOUND THIS HAS BEEN A ISSUE SINCE 2009-2014 TRUCKS. FORD REFUSES TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. THEY HAVE A TSB FOR IT. THEY MOVE FUSE TO OPEN SLOT IN FUSE PANEL & PUT A HEAVIER FUSE THAT CAN HANDLE LOAD. NOT ONLY DID THIS COST ME $500. BUT ALSO PUT ME & MY FAMILY IN EXTREME DANGER (SHUT DOWN ON FREEWAY WITH 18WHEELERS NEXT TO US) SOMEONE NEEDS TO MAKE FORD STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT.  I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE CHECK F-150 FORUMS, MANY OTHERS. THANKS",
