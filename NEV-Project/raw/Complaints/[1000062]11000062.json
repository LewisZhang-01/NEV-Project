        "summary": "ORIGINAL OWNER OF 2013 HONDA ODYSSEY, NOTICED SIGNIFICANT STEERING WHEEL VIBRATION AT 35K MILES WHILE GOING DOWN OR AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS WHILE SLOWING DOWN UNEXPECTEDLY. IT MADE ME GRAB THE STEERING WHEEL HARDER TO TRY TO STEADY THE WHEELS SO WE DON'T DRIVE OFF THE CLIFF.  I BELIEVE IT POSES A DANGER AS IT CREATES A SITUATION WHERE SUCH STEERING WHEEL VIBRATION AND TIRES VIBRATION CAN CAUSE A DANGEROUS SITUATION IN WHICH THE CONTROL OVER VEHICLE COULD BE LOST ALONG WITH LIVES OF THOSE IN THE CAR. I HAVE JUST REPLACED THE TIRES, WHICH WAS NOT THE CAUSE OF THE VIBRATION. THE CAR IS IN GOOD STANDING AS ALL RECOMMENDED SERVICES WERE COMPLETED TIMELY. WHEN CONTACTED THE LOCAL HONDA DEALER, THEY SAID THAT ROTORS NEEDS TO BE RESURFACED. BUT AS I AM READING ON THIS SITE AND OTHERS, THIS COULD BE AN ENDLESS AND EXPENSIVE RECURRENT SERVICE. THIS VEHICLE IS DESIGNED TO BE A FAMILY VEHICLE, THEREFORE IT SHOULDN'T BE A STANDARD WHEN ROTORS COME OUT OF FUNCTIONALITY AS SOON AS VEHICLE IS OUT OF FACTORY.",
