I WAS ATTENDING A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL GAME AND WHEN I STARTED THE TRUCK TO RETURN HOME A NOTICE CAME ON THE DASH. I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT I HAD NO POWER STEERING. I SHUT THE TRUCK DOWN, OPENED THE DOOR THEN RESTARTED. THE WARNING WAS GONE AND I HAD POWER STEERING. WHILE TURNING THE WHEEL LEFT WAS VERY EASY, TURNING THE WHEEL TO THE RIGHT WAS JUST SLIGHTLY HARDER.",
