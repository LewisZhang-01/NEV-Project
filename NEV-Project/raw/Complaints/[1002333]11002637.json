THIS APPLIES TO ALL GM VEHICLES WITH THIS MOTOR.  OWNERS ARE UNABLE TO GET THIS FIXED AS OEM PARTS ARE ON NATIONAL BACK-ORDER WITH NO ETA.  THE BACK-ORDER IS DUE TO GM HAVING TO RE-MANUFACTURE THE ENTIRE INVENTORY WHILE OVERWHELMING DEMAND FOR THESE REPLACEMENT CONDENSERS GROWS.  THIS IS A $1,100 REPAIR INCLUDING PARTS AND LABOR THAT SHOULD NOT BE THE BURDEN OF THE CONSUMER AS GM HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THIS IS DUE TO A MANUFACTURER DEFECT.  IN THE MEANWHILE WE HAVE TO DRIVE WITH OUR WINDOWS DOWN WHICH EXPOSES US TO EXHAUST FUMES OF OTHER VEHICLES AND DEBRIS BEING FREE TO ENTER THE VEHICLE.  NOTHING PROVOKED THIS FAILED CONDENSER AS I WAS SIMPLY DRIVING DOWN THE FREEWAY AT A NORMAL SPEED AND MY AIR CONDITIONER QUICKLY BECAME WARMER AS THE REFRIGERANT LEAKED OUT.",
