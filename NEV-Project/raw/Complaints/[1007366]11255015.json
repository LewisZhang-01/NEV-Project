I AM UNABLE TO TURN OFF MY VEHICLE COMPLETELY. I HAVE TO PRESS START AGAIN AND PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE AND BACK TO PARK, SOMETIMES MULTIPLE TIMES IN ORDER FOR THE VEHICLE TO REGISTER THAT IS IN PARK AND ALLOW ME TO SHUT OFF MY VEHICLE COMPLETELY. I AM CONCERNED THAT THE VEHICLE MAY NOT ACTUALLY BE IN PARK WHEN I PUT IT IN PARK. I DO NOT WANT IT TO ROLL DOWN A HILL AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TURN OFF MY CAR WITHOUT BEING CONCERNED IT WILL CONTINUE TO RUN ELECTRICAL AND KILL MY BATTERY.",
