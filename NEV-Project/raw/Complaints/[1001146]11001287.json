THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND WHEN I TOOK IT BACK TO THE RETAILER THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG \"POSSIBLY A LOOSE GAS CAP.\" A FEW WEEK LATER, TOWARDS THE END OF 2016 AND LESS THAN 40,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN, BUT THIS TIME THE CAR STARTED TO SMOKE AND OVERHEAT, SO I PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY, INTO A PARKING LOT AS QUICKLY AS I COULD.  THE COOLANT HAD BEEN LEAKING AND WAS DANGEROUSLY LOW.  I ADDED COOLANT AS PER THE JAGUAR HANDBOOK INSTRUCTION AND ABOUT AN HOUR LATER TRIED TO GET BACK ON THE ROAD.  THE CAR RAN FINE FOR A FEW MILES, BUT ONCE I STARTED TO ACCELERATE INTO THE 50-60 MPH RANGE ONTO THE HIGHWAY AGAIN A FEW MILES DOWN THE ROAD, THE SAME THING HAPPENED.  IT STARTED TO OVERHEAT AND SMOKE TERRIBLY.  I PULLED OVER TO THE SHOULDER AS QUICKLY AS SAFELY POSSIBLE AND NOTIFIED JAGUAR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE IN ORDER TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED BACK TO THE DEALERSHIPS SERVICE DEPARTMENT TO BE WORKED ON.  THE DEALERSHIP ENDED UP REPLACING THE ENGINE.  I INSISTED THAT I WAS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THIS CAR ANYMORE AND WANTED AN EXTENDED BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY.  I WAS ASSURED THAT THEY HAD PRACTICALLY \"REPLACED EVERYTHING UNDER THE HOOD AND IT WOULD RUN LIKE A BRAND NEW CAR.\" THIS WAS 8 MONTHS AGO.  THE CAR HAS SINCE BEEN IN THE SHOP FOR 3 ADDITIONAL MONTHS ON 10+ DIFFERENT OCCASIONS.  THE CAR IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE,  IT BREAKS DOWN WHEN STARTING OR SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN ON THE HIGHWAY AND IS VERY DANGEROUS.  IVE HAD QUITE A FEW CLOSE CALLS.  THIS CAR IS DANGEROUS AND THE DEALERSHIP EITHER CANNOT FIX IT OR WANTS TO KEEP PUTTING BAND AIDES ON IT UNTIL MY WARRANTY IS OUT THEN ITS NOT THEIR PROBLEM ANYMORE.  I HAVE LOST MY JOB DUE TO THE UNRELIABILITY OF THIS LEMON VEHICLE AND THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT IN FORT MYERS JAGUAR.",
