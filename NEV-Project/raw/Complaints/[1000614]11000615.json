I REPLACED TIMING BELT WITH ONE YEAR WARRANTY, BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS OWNER DID NOT DO IT.    12/09/16 I TOOK MY HONDA ODESSY 2004 TO MANHATTAN HONDA DEALERSHIP FOR RECALL. I ASKED TO HONDA REPRESENTATIVE TO CHECK AND TELL ME WHAT IS NECESSARY TO REPLACE OR REPAIR.     I KNEW THAT TRANSMISSION RECALL FOR HONDA ODESSY 2004 WAS OPEN AND TOLD THEM TO CHECK AND REPAIR IT IF IT IS NECESSARY, BUT THEY REFUSED TO DO IT  THEY TOLD ME THAT MY HONDA HAS MANY ISSUES AND REPAIR ALL NECESSARY THINGS WILL COST ME $10000. THE FUEL PUMP, TIMING BELT, WHICH I ALREADY REPLACED, AND TRANSMISSION CLUTCH WAS INCLUDED IN THE REPAIR LIST.    LAST MONTH I HAD A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE WHEN DRIVING THIS CAR. IT WAS  LOOSING POWER AND STOPPING WHEN I WAS DRIVING.  IT WAS DANGEROUS FOR TRAFFIC. IT OCCUR ON VERY DANGEROUS SPATS, LIKE EXITS FROM HGWAY, BROOKLYN BRIDGE ETC., I COULD START UP CAR IN 5 MINUTES AND IT WAS DRAWING WITH NO PROBLEMS THEN. IT WAS A FEW TIMES LIKE THIS AND THE LAST TIME I DROVE HOME AND COULDN'T START UP THE CAR NO MORE.    I TOWED CAR TO REPAIR SHOP AND MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT MY FUEL PUMP NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.     I CAME HOME AND STARTED RESEARCH AND  FOUND THE RECALL FOR HONDA ODESSY FUEL PUMP, FOR  HONDA ODESSY THAT WAS BUILT ON AND AFTER  06/21/04 IS ON RECALL FOR FUEL PUMP REPAIR OR REPLACE. MY HONDA ODESSY WAS BUILT 06/2004    I REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP AND CAR IS RUNNING VERY GOOD NOW AND I DO NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM AGAIN.    BECAUSE I HAD THE FUEL PUMP PROBLEM AFTER MY CAR WAS ON RECALL, AND BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT FUEL PUMP REPLACE  WAS INCLUDED IN RECALL, AND THEY KNEW THAT MY CAR HAS THIS PROBLEM AND DID NOT FIXED IT I AM HEREBY ASKING THE HONDA DEALERSHIP TO REIMBURSE MONEY THAT  I SPENT ON FUEL PUMP REPAIR $653.03. I ALSO ASKING HONDA DEALERSHIP TO CHECK AGAIN A TRANSMISSION AND REPAIR IT, IF IT IS NECESSARY.",
