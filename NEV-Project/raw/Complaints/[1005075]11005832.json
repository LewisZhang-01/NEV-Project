        "summary": "AT APPROX. 4600 MILES THE ENGINE STARTED TO SHAKE VIOLENTLY A COUPLE OF MILES AFTER THE EMISSION REGENERATION STARTED.  FORD HAS A SERVICE BULLETIN ON THIS ISSUE FOR F350 SUPER DUTY TRUCKS BUILT IN 2016.  APPARENTLY THE COMPUTER INCREASES THE FUEL IN ONE SIDE OF THE CYLINDER HEAD IN ORDER TO BURN OFF THE SOOT ON THE EMISSION FILTER.    THIS CAUSES THE ENGINE TO BACK FIRE CONTINUALLY.  THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED WE THOUGHT THAT THE EXHAUST FELL OFF IT SOUNDED SO BAD. THE SHAKING GOT TO BE SO BAD THAT WE HAD TO PULL OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TURN OFF THE ENGINE WHEN IT HAPPENS.  THE TRUCK WAS IN THREE TIMES FOR SERVICE AT 5985, 10669 AND 15210. FIRST, FORD DID A SOFTWARE UPDATE.  THE SECOND TIME IT WAS IN FOR REPAIR, THE DEALER PULLED OFF THE CYLINDER HEAD AND REPLACED IT.  THAT DIDN'T WORK EITHER.  NOW, FORD HAS DECIDED TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE ENGINE.  IT TAKES ABOUT 5000 MILES FOR THE ISSUE STARTS HAPPENING, SO WE WILL SEE IF THE NEW ENGINE DOES THE SAME THING.",
