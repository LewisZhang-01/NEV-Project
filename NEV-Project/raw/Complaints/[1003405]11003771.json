I TESTED THE ALTERNATOR, IT WAS GOOD. I GOT THE BATTERY CHARGED AND THE VEHICLE STARTED THAT DAY AND THE NEXT DAY. AFTER DOING RESEARCH ON THE ISSUE, I FOUND A RECALL ON 2013 CHEVY MALIBU ECO CARS FOR LOSS OF BATTERY CHARGE DUE TO A MALFUNCTIONING GCM. THE RECALL DESCRIBES EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH MY VEHICLE DOWN TO THE MALFUNCTION INDICATOR LIGHT COMING ON, WHICH IT DID. HOWEVER, AFTER SEARCHING FOR RECALLS USING MY VIN THERE WEREN'T ANY OPEN. I CHECKED WITH THE DEALERSHIP THAT I BOUGHT THE CAR FROM AND THAT RECALL HAD NOT BEEN SERVICED ON MY VEHICLE. I FEEL THAT THAT RECALL SHOULD BE OPEN ON MY VEHICLE.",
