THIS POSES FATAL CONSEQUENCES AT NIGHT WHEN THE DRIVER DOESN'T REALIZE THAT THEIR HEADLIGHTS AREN'T ON, BECAUSE THEIR GAUGE CLUSTER IS ALREADY PRE-ILLUMINATED. I HAVE NEARLY BEEN RUN OVER THREE TIMES BY OTHER CARS DRIVING WITHOUT THEIR HEADLIGHTS ON, BUT WITH A BRIGHT VIRTUAL GAUGE CLUSTER. VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS NEED TO FIND A WAY TO USE AMBIENT-LIGHT-SENSORS TO TURN THE GAUGE CLUSTER LIGHTING OFF IN LOW LIGHT SITUATIONS, SO THAT IT PROMPTS THE DRIVER TO TURN THE HEADLIGHTS ON IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO READ THE GAUGES....AND NOT HIT ANY PEDESTRIANS, BICYCLISTS, OR OTHER VEHICLES.",
