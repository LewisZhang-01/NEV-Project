I took it to a dealership that told me I needed two new batteries (needing these because the vehicle ruined the two I had). I took my vehicle to a battery store for them to install batteries, as soon as I left the pull over safely the car is going to shit down came on, on highway I finally found a place but not before the car started putting several warming lights on and check engine light on again, then lurching slowing to no acceleration and stopping in the middle of the road no power, none not even enough to power the door locks. This is the 3rd attempt at fixing this issue without any help from Chrysler that my Vin should be included in the U87 recall I have the same engine and problems. The dealership (Victory Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram) refused to actually fox the issue. Then told me because I did not buy the Mopar brand batteries that why my vehicle nearly killed my family, AGAIN.",
