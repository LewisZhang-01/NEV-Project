THE CAR'S ELECTRICAL SHIFTER HAS A SAFETY FEATURE THAT LOCKS THE KEY IN WHILE THE CAR IS OUT OF \"PARK\", BUT WHEN IT IS MALFUNCTIONING, IT  WILL NOT RELEASE THE KEY AT ALL.  DRIVERS WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT LEAVE CAR KEY IN THE CAR'S IGNITION AND IT CAUSES HAZARDS TO MINORS OR CHILD IN THE HOUSE OR ON THE STREETS BECAUSE KEY CAN STILL START THE CAR WITHOUT PROBLEM, ALSO DOORS CAN NOT BE LOCKED WHEN THE KEY IS STUCK IN IGNITION.  IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING A FEW TIMES, BUT HYUNDAI REFUSED TO ADMIT MANUFACTURER'S PART DEFECT.  MANY PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME ISSUE AND SEEKING FOR HELP ONLINE OR FROM YOUTUBE.  IT IS NOT SAFE FOR DRIVERS WITH KIDS. PLEASE HELP.",
