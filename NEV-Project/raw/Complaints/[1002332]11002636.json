THE NOTICE THEY SENT SUGGESTS NOT USING THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT WHICH IS COMPLETELY IMPRACTICAL AND IMPOSSIBLE FOR US AND, I IMAGINE, MOST OTHER PEOPLE WHO OWN A CAR THAT IS SUBJECT TO RECALL. ALSO, IF THE AIRBAGS ARE PROBLEMATIC, THEN IT MUST ALSO BE DANGEROUS FOR THE DRIVER TO CONTINUE USING THE CAR. TOYOTA NEEDS TO FIX THESE AIRBAGS IMMEDIATELY.",
