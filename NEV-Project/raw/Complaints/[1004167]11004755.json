        "summary": "MY CAR HAS BEEN TO HONDA TWICE FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE FIRST INCIDENT WAS JUNE 20TH AT 5PM AT WHOLE FOODS IN PHOENIX.  THE CAR WOULD TURN OVER THEN DIE.  THE NEXT MORNING I TOOK IT TO HONDA (IT STARTED AND DROVE).  I PICKED IT UP AT 5PM, THEY STATED THEY COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR.  AS I'M SITTING IN THE CAR AT HONDA THE CAR DIED AND WOULDN'T START.  THE NEXT DAY THEY TOLD ME IT WAS THE STARTER AND REPLACED IT AND I PICKED UP THE CAR FRIDAY JUNE 23RD.  THE CAR WAS FINE UNTIL SUNDAY AROUND 3PM AT SAFEWAY ON PHOENIX WHERE THE CAR WOULD START AND THEN DIE.  I TOOK AN UBER HOME AND SCHEDULED A TOW.  WHEN I GOT BACK TO SAFEWAY THE CAR STARTED AND I DROVE IT HOME.  MONDAY MORNING JUNE 26 I TOOK IT TO MY LOCAL MECHANIC WHO DIAGNOSED THE FUEL PUMP TO BE BAD AFTER TWO DAYS.  I TOWED IT BACK TO HONDA ON JUNE 28TH TO HAVE THE FUEL PUMP CHANGED UNDER WARRANTY.  THEY HAD TO ORDER THE PART AND I DID NOT GET MY CAR BACK UNTIL JULY 8TH.  ON MY WAY TO WORK TUESDAY JULY 11TH THE CAR DIED WHILE ON THE FREEWAY INTERCHANGE BETWEEN I10W AND I17N AND WAS FORCED TO THE SIDE OF THE RODE (THERE'S BARELY A SHOULDER) AND WAIT FOR A TOW AS THE CAR WOULD NO START.  I WAS TOWED TO SHOWCASE HONDA WHERE THE CAR IS NOW.  THIS LAST INCIDENT WAS MORE THAN JUST AN INCONVENIENCE IT WAS COMPLETELY UNSAFE.  THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THEY HAVE HAD THE CAR AND I HAVE ALMOST NO CONFIDENCE THEY ARE CAPABLE OF FIGURING OUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS CAR (THAT'S UNDER WARRANTY) AND I HONESTLY DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING THAT CAR ANY LONGER.",
