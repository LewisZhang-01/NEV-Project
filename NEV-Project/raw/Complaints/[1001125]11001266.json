AFTER I CUT THE OFF FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN I CAN SHIFT MY VEHICLE FROM PARK TO DRIVE WITHOUT A LOUD SCREECHING SOUND. TODAY, I HAD TO USE MY EMERGENCY BRAKES JUST TO KEEP MY VEHICLE STILL AFTER I PUT IT IN PARK. SEEMS AS THOUGH THE VEHICLE SHIFTS INTO ANOTHER GEAR AND GETS STUCK UNTIL I CUT MY VEHICLE OFF. I BELIEVE IT MAY BE THE TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE OR TRANSFER CASE ISSUE. I KNOW THERE WAS A RECALL ON THIS VEHICLE FOR THE TCM BUT I DIDN'T HAVE IT DONE. I NEED HELP, THIS IS GETTING TO SCARY, CONSTANTLY PAYING FOR A VEHICLE AND CALL THE MANUFACTURER AND NOBODY WANTS TO DO ANYTHING.",
