I HAVE A 1998 JEEP WRANGLER AND LIKE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS, MINE HAS DEVELOPED MAJOR FRAME RUST. I KNOW THIS ISNT GOING TO BE RESOLVED ANYTIME SOON, BUT I NEED TO GET MINE FIXED NOW. HOPEFULLY IF THERE IS EVER A RECALL I CAN STILL BE APART OF IT EVEN AFTER MINE IS REPAIRED. IM GOING TO BE HAVING IT PATCHED FOR NOW AS A FRAME REPLACEMENT WILL COST WAY TOO MUCH FOR ME AT THE MOMENT. MYSELF, ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS WOULD GREATLY BENIFIT FROM THIS BEING RECALLED. THERE ARE A LOT OF JEEPS OUT THERE DRIVING ON REPAIRED FRAMES. THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE RESOLVED BEING AS THERE ARE SO MANY WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM.",
