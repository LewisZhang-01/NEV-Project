        "summary": "I HAD AN ACCIDENT RELATED TO THE DRIVER'S SIDE GRAB HANDLE. I NEVER USUALLY USE IT TO GET INTO THE TRUCK, BUT DECIDED TO USE IT ON JUNE 7TH, 2017.  THE TRUCK IS HARDLY EVER DRIVEN AND IN VERY, VERY GOOD CONDITION. THE GRAB HANDLE WAS NOT LOOSE IN ANY WAY PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT AND HAD NEVER BEEN WORKED ON OR REPLACED. WHEN I GRABBED THE HANDLE TO PULL MYSELF INTO THE TRUCK, WHICH WAS STATIONARY AND PARKED IN A DRIVEWAY, THE WHOLE PANEL RIPPED RIGHT OFF AND SENT ME FALLING HARD TO THE ASPHALT DRIVEWAY. I FELL ABOUT 3 FEET. BY THE WAY, I ONLY WEIGH ABOUT 120 LBS. THE FALL CAUSED ME TO BREAK MY LEFT HIP. I LAID IN THE DRIVEWAY SCREAMING IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN AND FOR HELP UNTIL SOMEONE FOUND ME. AN AMBULANCE TRANSPORTED ME TO A HOSPITAL. I HAD A PARTIAL HIP REPLACEMENT DUE TO THE HIP FRACTURE. UPON INSPECTION, IT LOOKED LIKE THE PANEL/GRAB HANDLE WAS SECURED INTO THE BODY OF THE TRUCK BY PLASTIC DISCS AND CLIPS! I WAS SHOCKED AND ASSUMED SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD'VE BEEN SECURED BY A MORE STURDY MATERIAL. THIS ACCIDENT HAS BEEN PHYSICALLY AND FINANCIALLY DEVASTATING FOR ME.",
