THE SERVICE CUSTOMER SERVICE SAID THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY PARTS AVAILABLE AND WOULD CALL ME ONCE THEY GET SOMETHING. SINCE THIS IS A MAJOR RECALL AFFECTING THOUSANDS OF CARS, ALL TOYOTA SERVICE DEALERSHIPS SHOULD HAVE AMPLE OF AIRBAGS ON STOCK TO REMEDY THIS RECALL. SINCE THIS IS NATIONWIDE, ALL TOYOTAS SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR HAVING SUFFICIENT AIRBAGS AT ALL TIMES. WITH THAT BEING SAID, I JUST GOT INTO A CAR ACCIDENT TODAY ( JUNE 21, 2017 ) AND I HEARD A POP IN MY AIRBAG. LUCKILY, THE AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY AND NO ONE WAS INJURED. TOYOTA SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS RECALL AND HAVE SUFFICIENT AIRBAGS FOR ALL YEAR, MAKE AND MODELS.",
