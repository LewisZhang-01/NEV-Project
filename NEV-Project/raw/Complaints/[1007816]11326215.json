THE DEALERSHIP SAID IT WAS A MANUFACTURES DEFECT AS THE VEHICLE WAS LESS THAN TWO YEARS OLD. GMC DECLINED TO REPLACE THE PART BECAUSE IT WAS 500 MILES PAST THE WARRANTY ALTHOUGH THEY DID NOT DENY IT WAS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT. I HAVE A GMC CASE NUMBER DOCUMENTING MY DEALINGS WITH THEM. I HAVE PHOTOS FROM THE DEALERSHIP SHOWING THE CRACKED RADIATOR, AS WELL AS AN EMAIL STATING IT WAS A DEFECTIVE PART.  I HAVE THE RECEIPT AND I HAVE THE ACTUAL RADIATOR ITSELF.  I NOTICED THE RADIATOR LEAKING ON MY GARAGE FLOOR WHEN IT WAS STATIONARY.  THIS WAS 10 DAYS AFTER IT WAS LAST SERVICED AND THERE WAS NO ISSUE AT THAT TIME. THE DEALERSHIP SAID IT WAS NOT CAUSED BY IMPACT, BUT JUST THAT THE SEAM SPLIT AT THE TOP OF THE RADIATOR.*DT*JB",
