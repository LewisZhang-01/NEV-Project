WATER GATHERED IN THE FRONT PASSENGER FLOOR AS WELL AS THE REAR PASSENGER FLOOR. WATER IN SIDE BOARDS AS WELL.  THE AIRBAG INDICATOR LIGHT IS ON STATING URGENT SERVICE NEEDED. THE POWER BUTTON FOR THE SUNROOF CURTAIN WORKS INTERMITTENTLY.  AS WELL AS THE FAN MOTOR RUNS AFTER TURNING OFF THE IGNITION.  ALL SIGNS OF AN ELECTRICAL PROBLEM CAUSED BY THE CLOGGED TUBES AND COWL TRAIN.  I WANT TO BE PART OF THE EXISTING CLASS ACTION SUIT. NO SETTLEMENT HAS OCCURRED YET.  IT WAS BROUGHT UP IN 2010 AND HAS JUST BEEN REINSTATED AGAIN.  SIMILAR VOLVO'S WITH THE SAME YEAR HAVING THESE SAME PROBLEMS AND ISSUES.  HOPE THE GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATES THIS ISSUE.  VERY CONCERNED THAT THE AIRBAGS WILL DEPLOY OR WORSE YET NOT WORK AT ALL. THIS IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE.",
