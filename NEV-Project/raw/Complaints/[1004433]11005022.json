I HAVE FRIENDS THAT HAVE THE SAME DASHES IN SAME YEAR MODEL IN 2 SILVERADO'S 1 SUBURBAN AND 1 TAHOE AND ALL HAVE CRACKED IN THE SAME SPOT. THE SUBURBAN DASH WAS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY AND CRACKED AGAIN. MY DEALER SAID IT WAS OLD AND NOT UNDER WARRANTY SO THWY WILL NOT FIX IT. MY VEHICAL DASH CRACKED RIGHT OUT OF WARRANTY AND HAS BEEN TAKEN VERY GOOD CARE OF. I DO NOT EXPECT A $52,000 VEHICAL TO HAVE A DASH CRACK AND CHEVY NOT TO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT. THEY HAVE A PROBLEM IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE DASH AND NEED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND FIX IT. IT CONCERNS ME SINCE THE CRACK IS AT THE AIR BAG. I AM NOT SURE IF WHEN THE AIR BAG DEPLOYS IT COULD BRING A PIECE KF THE DASH WITH IT.",
