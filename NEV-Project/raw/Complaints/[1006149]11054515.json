I UNDERSTAND THIS IS A NATIONAL RECALL AND IT WILL TAKE TIME TO GET THE PARTS IN.  HOWEVER, I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE DRIVING MY VEHICLE WHEN THIS RECALL HAS BEEN LINKED TO DEATHS.  MERCEDES REFUSES TO DO ANYTHING IN THE MEANTIME, BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT HAD ANY REPORTS OF INJURY.  BOTTOM LINE IS I FEEL AT RISK DRIVING MY VEHICLE WHILE THE AIRBAGS ARE DEFECTIVE!",
