READING FORUMS CHEVROLET KNOWS THIS IS AN ISSUE, BUT IS IN NO HURRY TO FIX THE PROBLEM. ALSO READ THAT THIS ISSUE IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR AGAIN. THERE IS NO REASON A 2 YEAR OLD TRUCK SHOULD BE HAVING AC ISSUES. IT IS VERY COMMON IN THE SPECIFIC YEAR. GM NEEDS TO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT AND MAKE IT RIGHT.",
