THE FIRST TWO TIMES WERE WHEN I WAS TURNING, TWO OTHER TIMES WERE WHEN IT WAS DRIVING ON A STATE HIGHWAY, ONE TIME AFTER IT JUST STARTED, AND ANOTHER AS I LEFT MY DRIVEWAY. AT TIMES THE TRUCK WILL START WHEN A FUSE IS REPLACED, AT TIMES IT TAKES MULTIPLE FUSE CHANGES TO GET ON THE ROAD. THIS RESULTS IN THE ENGINE TO STOP AND POWER STEERING TO FAIL. THERE IS NO PATTERN IN WHEN IT HAPPENS. IT HAS BEEN TO TWO DEALERSHIPS AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM, DUE TO THE TRUCK WORKING WHEN A NEW FUSE IS INSERTED AFTER THE TRUCK WAS TOWED IN.",
