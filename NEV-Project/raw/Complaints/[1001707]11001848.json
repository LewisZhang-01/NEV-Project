MINE HAS A MANUEL TRANSMISSION SO I HAVE TO LEAVE IT IN GEAR TO KEEP IT FROM ROLLING. I HAVE SPOKEN WITH SEVERAL OTHER JEEP OWNERS AND THEY SAY THIS IS A COMMON JEEP PROBLEM BUT I FILL LIKE THIS SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER A RECALL. THE CLUTCH ALSO IS IN NEED OF REPLACEMENT AFTER ONLY 74,000 MILES OF DRIVING. HAS BEEN LIKE THIS SINCE I BOUGHT IT IN APRIL 2017.",
