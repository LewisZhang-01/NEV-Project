THE VIDEO SHOWS THAT THE LH FRONT WHEEL IS PUSHED UP AND BACK IN THE WHEEL WELL AND THAT THE SUSPENSION HAS COLLAPSED.  THIS SIDE OF THE CAR DID NOT HIT THE POLE AND IS UNDAMAGED APART FROM THE COLLAPSED SUSPENSION.  THERE HAVE BEEN DOZENS OF SIMILAR INCIDENTS IN WHICH THE TESLA SUSPENSION HAS COLLAPSED.  THERE ARE NO BUMP STOPS ON THE TESLA SUSPENSION AND A SIMPLE AIR LEAK CAN CAUSE A DISASTER. THIS INCIDENT COULD EASILY HAVE CAUSED A FATALITY.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS INCIDENT.  THANK YOU.  I AM NOT A TESLA OWNER JUST A CONCERNED CITIZEN.",
