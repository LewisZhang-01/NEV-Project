        "summary": "A THIN METAL SUPPORT PLATE WELDED TO REAR AXLE CONNECTS UPPER CONTROL ARMS TO REAR AXLE.  BOTH SUPPORT PLATES TOTALLY DISINTEGRATED FROM RUST. THESE PLATES ARE A STRUCTURAL COMPONENT OF VEHICLE SUSPENSION SYSTEM. WHEN THE UPPER CONTROL ARMS FAILED FROM FAILED SUPPORT PLATES, THE BRAKE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON. THE BRAKE LINE HAD BEEN DAMAGED MOST LIGHTLY FROM BRAKE LINE BEING HIT BY CONTROL ARM.  THE MOTION/LOUD NOISE OF DETACHED CONTROL ARMS CONTACTING METAL AXLE WAS FOLLOWED BY BRAKE LIGHT COMING ON. WITHIN 2 YEARS OF PURCHASE OF AUTOMOBILE CHASSIS RUST WAS NOTICEABLE AND COMMENTED BY MECHANICS. WHEN CONFRONTING TOYOTA, THEIR SAME COMMENT OF NOT BEING UNDER WAURANTY PREVAILED. THE LAST TIME I CONTACTED THEM I ASKED TO SPEAK TO THEIR ENGINEERS BECAUSE I FELT THE SUPPORT PLATE DESIGN IS UNSAFE AND TO THICKEN THE PLATE WOULD BE A SMALL EXPENSE. THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION WHEN THE SUPPORT PLATES FRACTURED. THEY TOLD ME I COULD TALK TO ANYONE ELSE OTHER THAN THEIR SUPPORT LINE AND THAT THE PLATE WOULD NOT BE CHANGED. I AM A DEGREED ENGINEER WITH A BACHELORS  AND TWO MASTERS IN ENGINEERING AND AM DISAPPOINTED IN HOW THEY VALUE PENNIES OVER AN OBVIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. BEST REGARDS MY NAME AND PHONE ARE (XXXX) PHONE (XXXX) IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS.
