        "summary": "SAFETY CONCERN REGARDING MANUAL TRANSMISSION COMING OUT OF GEAR WHILE ENGINE BRAKING.THIS HAS HAPPENED ON FLAT ROADS AND WHILE DESCENDING HILLS, AND WHILE IN FIRST OR SECONDS GEAR. ISSUE EASILY DUPLICATED WHEN IN FIRST GEAR AT LOW SPEED (BETWEEN 1,500 AND 3,000 RPM) GOING DOWNHILL WITH FOOT OFF GAS PEDAL. AS THE VEHICLE DESCENDS THE HILL, THE GEAR LEVER BEGINS MOVING AND EVENTUALLY POPS INTO NEUTRAL. ISSUE WAS REPORTED TO DEALERSHIP AT APPROXIMATELY 10,000 MILES, BUT THEY WERE UNABLE TO REPRODUCE. DURING REGULAR MAINTENANCE AT 30,000 MILES, THE ISSUE WAS BROUGHT UP AGAIN. WENT FOR A DRIVE WITH THE MASTER TECHNICIAN AND DUPLICATED THE PROBLEM MULTIPLE TIMES. DEALERSHIP INSPECTED SHIFT CABLES, BUSHINGS ON CABLES, CABLE ADJUSTMENT, ENGINE MOUNTS AND TRANSMISSION MOUNTS AND DEEMED THEM ALL IN GOOD CONDITION. DEALERSHIP CONTACTED SUBARU TECHNICAL SERVICES WHICH STATED THAT THE VEHICLE COMING OUT OF GEAR IS THE CAR \"OPERATING AS DESIGNED\" AND THAT IT IS \"NORMAL CONDITION FOR CABLE SHIFTED SPLIT CASE 6-SPEED TRANSMISSION\". DEALERSHIP ALSO VERIFIED THAT THE ISSUE OCCURS ON ANOTHER VEHICLE WITH THE SAME TRANSMISSION AND SHIFTER. NO REPAIR OR FURTHER INVESTIGATION WAS ADVISED.",
