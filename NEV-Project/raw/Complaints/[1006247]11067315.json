WITH THE LIGHTS AIMED LOWER, IT IS BARELY OK ON MOST NIGHTS BUT UNSAFE ON WET, DARK NIGHTS.    I HAVE PURCHASED AFTERMARKET BULBS BUT THEY WERE ONLY SLIGHTLY IMPROVED.  THE HIGH BEAMS ARE STILL TOO HIGH TO LIGHT THE ROAD, BUT THEY DO ILLUMINATE THE TREES.  A EUROPEAN CUTOFF BEAM PATTERN WOULD HELP TOO.",
