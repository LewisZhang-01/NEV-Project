        "summary": "THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE INCIDENTS WHERE I EXPERIENCED COMPLETE ENGINE FAILURE IN MY SANTE FE SPORT 2.0T.    INVOICE NUMBER ' 359131  FIRST OCCURRED AT 47,031 MILES. ON FEBRUARY 16, 2017 I WAS DRIVING MY VEHICLE WITH MY SON ON THE FREEWAY WHEN THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT APPEARED AND MY VEHICLE BEGAN JERKING AND MAKING A LOUD CLICKING TAPPING SOUND SLOWING ME DOWN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. I LOST POWER IN MY STEERING, VEHICLE WAS HARD TO MANEUVER. HYUNDAI ATTEMPTED TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM RETURNED MY VEHICLE AND CHARGED ME PARTIALLY FOR REPAIR. MADE CONTACT WITH THEM ABOUT REPAIR BEING A MISDIAGNOSIS AS THEY FIRST BLAMED THE INCIDENT ON AIR FILTER, SERPENTINE BELT, SPARK PLUGS, FUEL INJECTOR CLEANING, THEY REPLACED MY FUEL PUMP AND ENGINE BLOCK AT NO COST BUT CHARGED ME THE OTHER ITEMS.     WORK ORDER NUMBER 201868  THE SECOND INCIDENT OCCURRED AT 50,897 MILES ON JULY 14, 2017 I WAS TRAVELING ACROSS STATES FROM EL PASO, TEXAS TO COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO WITH MY 5 YR OLD SON AND MY HUSBAND. WE WERE TRAVELING NORTH ON HIGHWAY I-25 WHEN OUR VEHICLE BEGAN TO LOSE POWER AND STARTING MAKING THE LOUD VIBRATIONS AND TAPPING SOUNDS LIKE IT HAD DONE THE FIRST TIME ABOUT 3,000 MILES AGO WHEN I HAD THE ENGINE REPLACED. WE WERE OVER TAKING A SEMI TRUCK ON THE ROAD WHEN THIS HAPPENED WE WERE BARELY ABLE TO RECOVER OUR LANE AND PULL OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AS WE SLOWED DOWN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE SEMI WAS ABLE TO BRAKE AND AVOID REAR ENDING US. WE WERE STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE ABOUT AN HOUR AWAY FROM ALBURQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO. THIS WAS TERRIFYING FOR MY FAMILY AND I. WE HAD VERY LITTLE TIME TO REACT AND FIND A SAFE PLACE TO PULL OVER.     I BELIEVE MY VEHICLE WAS NOT INSPECTED PROPERLY THROUGH THEIR QUALITY CONTROL PERSONNEL. IF THERE IS DEBRIS INSIDE MY ENGINE AND IT HAS CONTINUOUSLY PRESENTED ITSELF IT WILL EVENTUALLY TRAVEL THROUGH THE REST OF MY ENGINE EX. TURBO SEALS BEARINGS.",
