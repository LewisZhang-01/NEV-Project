EVER SINCE I GOT THE REQUIRED EMISSIONS CONTROL ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION SOFTWARE UPDATE FROM FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES (FCA), MY TRUCK'S ENGINE PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN AFFECTED TO THE EXTENT THAT I CANNOT DEPEND ON IT'S EXCELLERATION.  I PRESS ON THE GAS PEDDLE, AND THE ENGINE HESITATES SEVERELY BEFORE IT ACCELERATES.  FROM A STOP SIGN OR A RED LIGHT, THE HESITATION IS SUCH THAT I WON'T TRY TO CROSS THE INTERSECTION IF THERE ARE ANY CARS EITHER TO MY RIGHT OR LEFT.  SIMILARLY, THE HESITATION AND ACCELERATION LAG MAKES MERGING ONTO A HIGHWAY A SAFETY CONCERN.  THE TRUCKS FUEL ECONOMY HAS ALSO  BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.  I URGE THE NHTSA TO COMPEL CFA TO REVERSE THE SOFTWARE UPDATE, OR FIX IT SUCH THAT THE TRUCK IS NO LONGER A DRIVING SAFETY CONCERN.",
