        "summary": "FRONT SEAT, MIDDLE CONSOLE CUP HOLDERS, TRIM, HAS BECOME DANGEROUS!  THE HIGH POLISHED SILVER COLORED ACCENT TRIM HAS PULLED AWAY FROM THE CIRCULAR AREA OF THE CUP HOLDERS.  THE MATERIAL IS A PLASTIC METAL THAT IS VERY SHARP AND HAS CUT UP MY FINGERS OVER 10 TIMES IN THE LAST YEAR.  BECAUSE THE DESIGN ROLLS IN AND DOWN LIKE A BACKWARDS C THE PLASTIC METAL HAS FRAYED FROM USE AND DOESN'T LAY FLAT OR SEALED TO THE CUP HOLDERS.  EACH TIME THE CUP HOLDERS ARE USE THE CUPS GET CAUGHT ON THE CUP HOLDERS AND ALSO CUT THE CUPS.  I HOPE A COFFEE CUP DOESN'T BREAK ON ME OR A PASSENGER IN THIS SITUATION AND BURN THEM.   MY OPTIONS ARE TO PEEL THE BAD TRIM AWAY AND HAVE IT LOOK WORSE OR PAY A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY TO REPLACE THE WHOLE MIDDLE CONSOLE UNIT, NOT PRACTICAL FOR THE CONSUMER.  THIS IS ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE USER AND NOT THE VISUAL APPEARANCE.",
