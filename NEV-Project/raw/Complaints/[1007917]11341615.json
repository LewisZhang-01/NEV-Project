AFTER IMPACT THE TRUCK STARTED TO ROLL BACKWARDS AND HAD TO PUT IN PARK TO STOP THE TRUCK. TOW TRUCK DRIVE ALSO HAD ISSUES LOADING ON THE ROLL BACK, BRAKES WOULD NOT WORK. WE TOWED TO OUR BODY SHOP FOR REPAIRS. THEN WAS TAKEN TO FAULKNER DEALERSHIP FOR EDR TESTING. NOTHING MECHANICAL WAS EVER DONE WITH THE TRUCK AFTER THE BODY WORK WAS DONE. BOSCH RELEASED THE TRUCK TO THE DEALERSHIP. TRUCK HAS 513 MILES AND LITTLE OVER 200 OF THE MILES ARE WHAT WE DROVE IT. PURCHASED WITH MILES ON IT. FIAT / CHRYSLER DO NOT SEE AN ISSUE WITH THE TRUCK VIA THE REPORT. I HAVE SENT THE REPORT TO A SEPARATE PARTY THAT IS NOT HIRED BY FIAT AND THEY INDICATE TO RESEARCH PAGE 42 OF THE REPORT ON THE MASTER CYLINDER BRAKING SYSTEM. WE DO NOT SEE ANY INDICATION ON ANY CODES THAT WERE RECOVERED PERFORMED BY BOSCH. WE KNOW IN FACT THAT THERE WERE MULTIPLE BRAKE CODES AND FEEL THAT THE INFORMATION IN STILL IN THE \"BLACK BOX\".  AIRBAGS NEVER DEPLOYED AT IMPACT OF 35 MPH FRONTAL IMPACT.*DT*DT*JB*JB",
