        "summary": "ON JUNE 16,2017, WHILE I WAS DRIVING  ON FREEWAY, I TRIED TO SLOWED DOWN BUT IT TURNED OUT TO ACCELERATE SUDDENLY AT AROUND 85MPH, THE STEERING SYSTEM  WAS MESSED UP AND I LOST CONTROL  OF MY CAR , THE MORE I TRY TO BRAKE THE FASTER THE CAR CRASHED , SO IT CRASHED TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND ROLLED OVER DOWN TO THE DITCH , I CALLED 911 AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS NO  SIGNAL, I COULD NOT OPEN THE DOOR NOR WINDOW. THE SMOKE CAME  OUT FROM INSIDE AND THE CAR CAUGHT ON FIRE , I COULD HAVE BEEN BURNT  TO DEATH ALIVE WITHOUT PEOPLE PASSING BY , THEY USED A BIG ROCK TO BREAK THE WINDOW AND PULLED ME OUT OF THE CAR, TWO MINUTES LATER , THE CAR EXPLODED AND BURNT TO GROUND. THIS IS A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE , PEOPLE LIKE ME SPENT SO MUCH MONEY ON PURCHASING SUCH AN EXPENSIVE CAR WITH EXPECTATION TO BE SAFER IN DRIVING , BUT WHEN IT COMES TO CAR ACCIDENT , THERE ARE STILL SO MANY FLAWS WHICH COULD HAVE LED TO WRONGFUL DEATH , THIS MAKES ME FEEL FRUSTRATED AND I CALLED MB LONG BEACH AND BEVERLY  HILLS  , THEY JUST SHOWED INDIFFERENT AND IT'S NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS . I'M  NOW VERY DISAPPOINTED AND  I HOPE THERE WON'T BE ANY VICTIMS LIKE THIS . I WAS THE EXCEPTION AND I HOPE PEOPLE DRIVING MB GLK350 COULD BE LUCKY ENOUGH . MB OWES ME AN EXPLANATION AND INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT , MAYBE A RECALL IF NECESSARY FOR THE SAFETY OF CONSUMERS .",
