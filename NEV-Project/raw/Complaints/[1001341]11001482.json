HAVE HAD TO PULL INTO BIKE LANES QUICKLY IN ORDER NOT TO BE HIT FROM BEHIND.     THERE ARE 2 OCCASIONS WHEN THIS OCCURS.   1) WHEN AT A STOP ON A CITY STREET, WAITING TO MAKE A RIGHT. FOOT OFF PEDAL, ACCELERATE, ENGINE BEGINS TO STALL.  2) WHEN ROLLING INTO A RIGHT TURN (ON CITY STREETS) ACCELERATION CAUSES START OF STALL PROCESS.     WE HAVE NOT FULLY STALLED AS OF YET. BUT THIS COULD BE A BAD SCENARIO IF IT DOES.     WE HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT GAS VAPOR ISSUES WITH THE PHOENIX, AZ HEAT BEING 119 DEGREES, BUT IF THAT WERE THE CASE, IT WOULD HAPPEN OTHER TIMES AND NOT JUST DURING TURNS.    THANKS",
