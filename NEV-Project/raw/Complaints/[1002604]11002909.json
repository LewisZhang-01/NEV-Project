        "summary": "ON 7/2/17 I WAS RIDING ON HIGHWAY 13 TRAVELING 50-55 MILES PER HOUR AND GOING INTO A GENTLE CURVE HEADING TO CLINTON, MO. FOR LUNCH WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS. MY RIGHT SADDLEBAG CAME OFF THE BIKE AND SLIDE ACROSS THE ASPHALT ROAD INTO A GRASSY AREA. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN BAD SINCE THERE WERE FIVE (5) BIKES BEHIND ME, I TURNED AROUND AS DID SOME OF THE OTHER TO GO BACK TO GET WHAT WAS LEFT OF MY BAG AND CONTENTS.  ON SATURDAY 7/1/17 I HAD MY BIKE IN THE SHOP FOR IT'S 20,000 MILE SERVICE AND TOLD THEM TO CHECK EVERYTHING OUT REALLY GOOD BECAUSE I AM LEAVING ON A TRIP TO SOUTH DAKOTA IN TWO (2) WEEKS; USUALLY THEY CHECK EVERY NUT, BOLT AND CABLE TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE IN GOOD CONDITION AND WORKING ORDER, I DON'T KNOW IF THEY CHECK THIS OR NOT, BUT AFTER I TOLD THE DEALERSHIP (OUTLAW HARLEY-DAVIDSON IN BLUE SPRINGS, MO) WHAT HAPPEN AND FELT THAT THEY SHOULD REPLACE THE SADDLEBAG AS I DON'T TAKE THEM OFF I ONLY HAVE THEM DO THAT WHEN THEY DO SERVICE AND/OR WASH THE BIKE FOR ME.  THE GENERAL MANGER OF THIS DEALERSHIP GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION THEY AREN'T GOING TO DO ANYTHING FOR ME, BUT AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET I SAW THAT HARLEY HAS A RECALL ON SOME MODELS (MINE IS LISTED FLHXS EVEN THOUGH WHEN I TYPED IN THE VIN# IT STATED NO RECALLS) I FEEL THE DEALERSHIP SHOULD FIX AND/OR REPLACE THE DAMAGED BAG AND PINS THAT HOLD THEM ON..",
