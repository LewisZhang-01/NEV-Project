        "summary": "VEHICLE RUN ROUGH, JERKING,HESITATING AND ACCELERATING. STALLS WHEN STOPPING CAUSING CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, TRANSMISSION SERVICE AND OTHER WARNING LIGHT TO FLASH. WHEN RESTARTING IT VIOLENTLY SHIFTS AND SLAMS INTO GEAR, REVERSE FIRST AND THEN IN DRIVE. WHEN IN REVERSE OR DRIVE IT GOES INTO NEUTRAL. REQUIRES ANOTHER RESTART WITH SAME CONSEQUENCES. WHEN ATTEMPTING TO DRIVE THERE IS NO ACCELERATION AT FIRST THEN SLOW ACCELERATION WHILE IT IS ACTING LIKE IT WILL STALL AGAIN FEELING REAL SLUGGISH. ALL THE WHILE LIGHTS ARE FLASHING ON THE DASH. IT HAS BEEN IN FOR SERVICE 8 TIMES THE MOST RECENT BEING 7/11/2017. SERVICE HAS PERFORMED REPLACING TCM AND UPDATING IT 5 TIMES, REPLACING VAPOR CANISTER, FUEL TANK. VEHICLE HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO SERVICE DEPARTMENT WITH ALL THE THE ISSUES HAPPENING AND WAS DIAGNOSED AS NO ISSUES FOUND. SERVICE DEPARTMENT HAS TRIED TO PLACE THE BLAME ON ME STATING THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO PUMP GAS, AS I AM OVERFILLING. (THIS IS INCORRECT) ANOTHER ISSUE THAT IS HAPPENING IS THAT WHEN TRYING TO FUEL THE VEHICLE AT ANY GAS STATION, IT WILL ONLY TAKE A LITTLE FUEL AND CLICK OFF LIKE IT IS FULL WHEN IN FACT IT IS NEAR EMPTY. GASSING THE VEHICLE CAN TAKE UPWARDS OF 15 MINUTES TO GET TO THE 3/4 MARK. THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN A SAFETY HAZARD TO DRIVE SINCE DEC 2015 WHEN THE STALLING OUT AS I AM TRYING TO CROSS TRAFFIC, SCARY SITUATION BUT LUCKILY I WASN'T HIT. LOSES ACCELERATION WHEN DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AND ON THE INTERSTATES, WHICH NOW LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND PLACES THAT I DRIVE THIS VEHICLE, AS I PREFER THAT MYSELF AND MY FAMILY INCLUDING GRAND CHILLDREN  LIVE VS. DIE. SO IN ESSENCE I HAVE A LUXURY VEHICLE THAT I PAY $600/MONTH AND I CAN ONLY DRIVE IT AROUND LIKE AN OLD BEATER CAR. WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. FIAT CHRYSLER HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR AND REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT, CLOSING MY CASE BECAUSE SERVICE FINDS NO ISSUE.",
