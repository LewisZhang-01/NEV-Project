THE NEW BULBS WERE BETTER FOR A LITTLE WHILE BUT NOW WHEN USING THE DIM HEADLIGHTS, YOU CANNOT EVEN TELL THEY ARE ON.  THE BRIGHT HEADLIGHTS HAVE TO BE USED AT ALL TIMES WHILE DRIVING AT NIGHT, OR YOU CANNOT SEE ANYTHING AT ALL.  THIS IS A LAWSUIT AND ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.  I CAN DEFINITELY SEE MOISTURE GETTING INTO THE LIGHT HOUSING AND I THINK IT IS CAUSING ALL THE PROBLEMS.",
