I DROVE THE CAR STRAIGHT TO MY HONDA DEALER AND THERE IS NO EXTERNAL OIL LEAK THEREFORE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT OIL IS LEAKING INSIDE THE ENGINE AND BURNING AND THAT IS WHY THE SMOKE IS COMING FROM BY TAILPIPE HOWEVER THE LIGHT INDICATOR WAS A LITTLE TO LATE BECAUSE THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE AND NOW THE ENGINE HAS TO BE REPLACED ALONG WITH MY CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND NO TELLING WHAT ELSE.  THE DEALER NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT THIS A LAWSUIT INDICATING THAT THIS WAS A PROBLEM IN THIS MAKE AND MODEL SO I PICKED THE VEHICLE UP AND AS I TRIED TO MAKE IT HOME IT BROKE DOWN ON ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSTATE IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC, HAD TO TOW IT HOME.  CALLED HONDA MANUFACTURER AND MY VIN NUMBER DOES NOT QUALIFY UNDER THAT CLASS ACTION EVEN THOUGH IT IS A 2008 ODYSSEY.  NOW I HAVE A VEHICLE SITTING IN MY GARAGE THAT DOES NOT RUN AND HAS NO RESALE VALUE AND IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HONDA IS GOING TO HELP OUT IN ANY WAY.  IF YOU OWN A 2008-2013 HONDA YOU MAY WANT TO CHECK YOUR OIL LEVEL REGULARLY BECAUSE THE LIGHT INDICATORS OR NOT VERY RELIABLE.",
