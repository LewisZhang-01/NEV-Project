I HAD THE NEW STEERING  BOX CHANGED OUT ALONG WITH THE NEW UPDATE WHICH HELPED SOME BUT YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY KEEP CONTROL OR IT WILL WANDER OFF THE ROAD OR INTO OTHER LANE OF TRAFFIC. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. THERE IS TOO MUCH PLAY IN THE STEERING  AND IT IS EXHAUSTING WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING. DEALERSHIP STATED THAT \"IT IS A JEEP\". I HAVE OWNED 5 OTHER JEEPS AND NEVER HAD AN ISSUE AS BAD AS THIS IS. JEEP HAS TO RECOGNIZE THE ISSUE AND ISSUE A SAFETY WARNING BEFORE SOMEONE'S LIFE IS INVOLVED. I HAVE SPENT MONEY ON A FRONT END ALIGNMENT IN HOPES THIS WOULD ELIMINATE  THE PROBLEM AND HAD TO ADD AN ALIGNMENT CASTER/ PINION ANGLE BOLT KIT AND STILL WANDERING.",
