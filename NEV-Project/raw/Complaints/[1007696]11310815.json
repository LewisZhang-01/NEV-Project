THE CARS ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IS ALWAYS FALLING LIGHTS COME ON WHILE IM DRIVING AND WON'T TURN OFF FOR A HALF HOUR LAYER NO MATTER WHAT I DO. THE AIR BAG LIGHTS ARE ALWAYS COMING ON AND THE TRANSMISSION IS FAILING WHEN YOU SHIFT INTO GEAR THERE'S ALWAYS A BIG GUMPING SOUND AND THE SHIFT GETS STUCK IN PARKED GEAR FOR MINUTES BEFORE IT WANTS TO SHIFT INTO GEAR. I'VE READ A LOT OF THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH THIS MAKE AND MODEL CAR THEY SHOULD BE RECALLED ITS DANGEROUS",
