        "summary": "RECALL NOTICE WAS RECEIVED IN MARCH 2016. I CONTACTED TOYOTA SANTA MONICA (THEY ARE THE CLOSEST LOCATION TO HOME AND MOST CONVENIENT FOR WORK) AND WAS TOLD THEY WOULD CALL ME TO LET ME KNOW IF THE PART WAS IN. TWO WEEKS PASSED AND I CALLED AGAIN. I WAS TOLD THEY HAD TO ORDER THE PART AND WOULD GET A CALL WHEN IT CAME IN. TWO MONTHS LATER, I CALL AGAIN AND WAS INFORMED THE PART WAS BACKORDERED 4-6 WEEKS AND WOULD ONCE AGAIN RECEIVE A CALL TO LET ME KNOW WHEN I CAN BRING MY VEHICLE IN. ADMITTEDLY, THE NOTICE WAS FORGOTTEN AS I WAITED. I FOUND THE RECALL NOTICE AND CONTACTED TOYOTA SANTA MONICA ON JUNE 29, 2017 IN HOPES OF BRINGING IN MY VEHICLE ON JULY 5TH. I WAS TOLD THEY HAD ONE PART IN STOCK, BUT IF I WANT TO BRING MY CAR IN AT THAT TIME THEY WOULD HAVE TO PLACE AN ORDER. BECAUSE OF MY WORK SCHEDULE THE 5TH WAS THE BEST TIME FOR ME. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WILL THEN HAVE TO ORDER THE PART, BUT EVEN WITH THE HOLIDAY THEY SHOULD GET IT IN BY THE 5TH AND THEY WOULD CALL ME TO LET ME KNOW THE PART WAS IN FACT IN SO I COULD BRING IN MY VEHICLE. I CALLED AGAIN ON JULY 14TH AND SPOKE TO THE PARTS DEPARTMENT OF TOYOTA SANTA MONICA. NOT ONLY WAS MY NAME AND NUMBER NOT IN THE SYSTEM, THERE WAS NEVER ANY ORDERS PLACED UNDER MY NAME. I WAS THEN INFORMED THAT THEY HAD PLENTY OF PARTS IN STOCK. I WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE SERVICE CENTER TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WHERE NO ONE ANSWERED. JULY 17TH, I GET A HOLD OF THE SERVICE CENTER FOR TOYOTA SANTA MONICA WHERE I WAS ONCE AGAIN INFORMED THEY HAVE PLENTY OF THOSE PARTS IN STOCK AND OVER A YEAR LATER I FINALLY HAVE AN APPOINTMENT. I HAD CALLED FOUR TIMES AND FOUR TIMES I WAS TOLD AN ORDER WAS PLACED. NOT ONLY DID I NEVER RECEIVE ANY RETURNED CALLS, BUT THE PART WAS NEVER ORDERED UNDER MY NAME.",
