AFTER A FLURRY OF COMPLAINTS TO THE NHTSA, VW WILL REPLACE COMPONENTS INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION. ISSUES APPARENTLY STEMMED FROM FAULTY TEMPERATURE SENSORS THAT WOULD FORCE THE DSG BOXES INTO NEUTRAL, OFTEN WHILE OWNERS WERE DRIVING. VW WILL REPLACE THE COMPONENTS AND OFFER LOANER CARS DURING THE REPAIRS. OWNERS WHO HAVE ALREADY PAID OUT-OF-POCKET FOR THE FIX WILL BE REIMBURSED. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO APPLY A 10-YEAR, 100,000-MILE TRANSFERRABLE WARRANTY TO THE DSG TRANSMISSIONS.   BUT WHEN I TALK TO VW DEALER BROOKLYN THAY TOLD ME GOODBYE, YOU HAVE RECALL FROM AIRBAG. AND WE DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR DSG PROBLEM   ALTHOUGH IT WAS SAID  THE COMPANY WILL ALSO APPLY A 10-YEAR, 100,000-MILE TRANSFERRABLE WARRANTY TO THE DSG TRANSMISSIONS.    1. TAKATA RECALL  2. DSG TRANSMISSION, DELAY, JERKS ON THE REAR GEAR. MECHATRONIC ALWAYS OVERHEAT.  WHEN TURNING ON THE REAR GEAR IT DOES NOT TURN ON VERY LARGE ENGINE RMP AND THEN QUCKLY TURNS ON, I FIND IT VERY DANGEROUS, BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW IF THE REAR GEAR IS TURNED ON AT ALL     VOLKSWAGEN RECENTLY INITIATED A RECALL ON 2009-10 VWS AND AUDIS EQUIPPED WITH ITS HIGH-PERFORMANCE DIRECT SHIFT GEARBOX (DSG) TRANSMISSIONS.       VW SAID IT WOULD REPAIR OR REPLACE THE COMPONENTS IN THE TRANSMISSIONS AT NO CHARGE TO THE VEHICLES&#8217; OWNERS.
