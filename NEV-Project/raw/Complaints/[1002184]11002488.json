IT HAS BEEN AROUND 25 MPH, THEN AT 5 MPH AND NOW CURRENTLY AT 30 MPH. THE MOST RECENT TIME THEY ATTEMPTED TO FIX IT (THE 4TH TIME) THEY REPLACED A VALVE BODY, AND IT MADE THE PROBLEM WORSE, SO THEY ARE ORDERING ME A TRANSMISSION, WHICH THEY SAY ARE ON BACK ORDER, AND DO NOT HAVE AN ETA FOR ME. SINCE JUNE 5TH MY VEHICLE HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP FOR 12 DAYS AND COUNTING SINCE I CALLED AGAIN TODAY AND THEY STILL HAVE NO CLUE WHEN THEY CAN GET A NEW TRANSMISSION.",
