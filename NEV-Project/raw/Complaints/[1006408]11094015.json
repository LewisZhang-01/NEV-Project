ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS MY JEEP ON-BOARD GPS HAS ORDERED A RIGHT OR LEFT TURN VERBALLY BUT WHEN THE MAP WAS LOOKED AT IT WOULD INDICATE THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.    THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF I LISTEN TO THE SPOKEN DIRECTIONS I MAY BE TURN THE WRONG WAY.  IF I CONSULT THE MAP AFTER I BEGIN THE TURN I HAVE TO CROSS LANES.    I HAVE NOT YET HAD AN ACCIDENT BUT HAVE HAD CLOSE CALLS.  I HAVE ASKED TWO OTHER OWNERS OF JEEP GRAND CHEROKEES 2014 AND BOTH HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS",
