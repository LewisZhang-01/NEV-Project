I DROVE TO THE DEALER ONLY FOR THEM TO REFUSE TO RUN A SIMPLE DIAGNOSTIC. WAS DRIVING AND VEHICLE BEING ACCELERATING EVEN AFTER I COMPLETELY REMOVED ME FEET; I ALSO LOOKED DOWN WITNESSED THE PEDAL MODULATING ITSELF IN AND OUT, SHORTLY FOLLOWED BY AN ABRUPT BRAKING INCIDENT. I WAS JUST ABLE TO RESTART AND PULL OVER TO EMERGENCY STOP. I HADNT GOTTEN FAR FROM THE DEALER, SO AFTER TWO HOURS OF WAITING FOR A TOW TRUCK, I ATTEMPTED TO DRIVE THE TRUCK BACK TO THE DEALER ONLY TO HAVE THE SAME VIOLENT BRAKING BUT THIS TIME ALSO FOLLOWED BY A SPORADIC LOSS OF POWER STEERING. I WAS ABLE TO CREEP THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER AND CONTROL ANY LOSSES OF CONTROL, IT FELT LIKE THE VEHICLE WAS HAVING A SEIZURE.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE MY STALL, UNINTENDED BRAKING, POWER STEERING LOSS, AND FAN (I IMAGINE THIS COULD BE A FIRE ISSUE AS WELL).   THANK YOU",
