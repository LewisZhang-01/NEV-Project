        "summary": "WE OWN A 2004 JEEP LIBERTY THAT WAS PURCHASED NEW IN VIRGINIA AND RESOLD TO OUR FAMILY IN 2013, IN VIRGINIA.  ON 22 JUNE 2017, MY 18 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING OUR JEEP ON MOUNTAIN ROADS ABOUT 50 MILES FROM OUR HOME WHEN SHE NOTICED THE VEHICLE WAS \"SWERVING\" AND MAKING A NOISE.  SHE MANAGED TO SAFELY MOVE THE VEHICLE OUT OF THE TRAFFIC LANE AND CONTACT ME.     UPON MY ARRIVAL AND INSPECTION OF THE VEHICLE, I NOTICED THE REAR LOWER CONTROL ARM ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE HAD COMPLETELY BROKEN AND ALLOWED THE REAR END TO SHIFT POSITION, CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO TRACK FAR OUT OF ALIGNMENT AND CAUSING THE REAR TIRE TO RUB ON THE FENDER WALL.  I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE RUST APPEARED TO BE THE CAUSE OF THE CONTROL ARMS FAILURE.    AFTER GETTING THE VEHICLE HOME AND RESEARCHING PARTS TO REPLACE THE BROKEN CONTROL ARM, I DISCOVERED THAT PART HAD BEEN RECALLED ON 2004 JEEP LIBERTYS WHICH SURPRISED ME BECAUSE I HAD THE VEHICLE SERVICED BY A JEEP DEALER TO ENSURE ALL RECALLS HAD BEEN COMPLETED.  UPON FURTHER RESEARCH, HOWEVER, I LEARNED THE RECALL ONLY EFFECTED THOSE LIBERTYS IN THE NORTH EAST AND UPPER MIDWEST WHERE SALT IS FREQUENTLY USED ON SNOWY ROADS (HTTPS://WWW.AUTOTRADER.COM/CAR-RECALL/JEEP-ADDS-137000-LIBERTY-SUVS-TO-RECALL-171108).      WHILE THIS EXPLAINS WHY THE DEALERSHIP HADN'T REPAIRED THE ITEM, IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T EXPLAIN WHY WE WEREN'T NOTIFIED THAT THE PART IS PRONE TO SUCH FAILURES, CONSIDERING VIRGINIA DOES RECEIVE A FAIR SHARE OF SNOW AND A HUGE PORTION OF THE VIRGINIA POPULATION COMMUTES INTO WASHINGTON D.C. (WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN THE RECALL) IT SEEMS EXTREMELY NEGLIGENT TO ALLOW OWNERS OF THIS VEHICLE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE THEM WITHOUT AT LEAST A NOTIFICATION EVEN IF JEEP DOESN'T HAVE TO REPLACE THE ITEM.    I PURCHASED UNGRADED AFTERMARKET CONTROL ARMS AND INSTALLED THEM MYSELF, I'VE INCLUDED A PICTURE OF THE ORIGINAL CONTROL ARM.
