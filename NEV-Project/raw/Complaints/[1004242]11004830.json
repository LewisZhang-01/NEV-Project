THAT MAY BE TRUE, BUT I AS A PHYSICIAN DO DECLARE THAT A SURVIVOR OF A ROLLOVER MAY HAVE BETTER SURVIVAL WHEN AIRBAGS DEPLOY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WITH SURVIVAL AFTER SEVERE BRAIN INJURIES. I AM PERMANENTLY DISABLED NOW. I FIND IT UNCONSCIOUBLE THAT AIRBAGS DON'T DEPLOY IN ROLLOVERS. I MEAN WHY NOT? THE DATE OF MY ACCIDENT WOULDN'T ENTER PROPERLY BUT WAS 02/22/1995.",
