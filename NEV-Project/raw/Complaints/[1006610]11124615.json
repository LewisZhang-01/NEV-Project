I TOOK MY CHANCES AND DROVE IT TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP. EVERY TIME I CAME TO A COMPLETE STOP THE CAR WOULD CUT OFF I.E RED LIGHTS, STOP SIGNS, HEAVY TRAFFIC. WHICH BECAME EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. I DROPPED MY CAR OFF AT THE DEALERSHIP AND I NOTICED THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL VECHICALS THAT WERE THE SAME MODEL / MAKE AS MINES WAITING TO BE SERVICED. ALSO SERVERAL OF MY RELATIVES WHO HAS THE SAME CAR AS MINE HAS TOLD ME THAT THEY ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE. THE DEALERSHIPS ALL ACROSS TOWN ARE OUT OF LOANER CARS AND CAN'T GET TO MINE UNTIL NEXT WEEK. 3 PEOPLE I KNOW TOOK THEIR VEHICLE TO BE SERVICED AND EACH WERE TOLD THEY NEEDED A TUNE UP. AFTER RECEIVING THE TUNE UP THE PROBLEM STILL REMAINED. ALL OF OUR CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS ARE ON.",
