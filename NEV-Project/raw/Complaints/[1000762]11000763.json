I EXITED THE GAS STATION ONTO THE RAMP FOR THE INTERSTATE. THE CAR SUDDENLY LOCKED UP LESS THAN A MILE DOWN THE INTERSTATE WHILE DRIVING 70, MPH. THERE WAS NO POWER BRAKING OR POWER STEERING AT ALL. FORTUNATELY, I REMAINED IN THE FAR RIGHT LANE AND MOMENTUM CARRIED THE VEHICLE OFF THE NEXT EXIT RAMP BEFORE VEHICLE COMPLETELY SHUT OFF. I HAVE HAD A HOST OF OTHER ISSUES INCLUDING PSM FAILURES, START/STOP MODE DEACTIVATED ERRORS, IGNITION PROBLEMS, BRAKING ISSUES, UNNECESSARY REPAIRS, TIME/ENERGY, MISSED WORK, RENTAL CARS, MISDIAGNOSES, ETC. I AM CERTAIN THE SYMPTOMS ARE CONSISTENT WITH CAMSHAFT DEFECT AFFECTING MANY OTHER CAYENNE S, TURBO, AND PANAMERA S OWNERS PER SEVERAL  INTERNET FORUM DISCUSSIONS. THIS IS REALLY DANGEROUS. I AM DISAPPOINTMENT EARLIER NOTIFICATIONS WERE NOT ISSUED AND I HOPE THIS MATTER IS ADDRESSED BEFORE SOMEONE DIES.",
