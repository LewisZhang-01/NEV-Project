A WOMAN RAN INTO ME AND A CLIENT OF MINE AS I WAS ON THE JOB! I WAS IN COMPLETE SHOCK! I STAYED IN MY VEHICLE AS I TRIED TO STAY CALM. I GOT OUT OF MY VEHICLE AND CALL 911 FIRST THEN A BYSTANDERED CALLED CAMPUS SECURITY. STATEMENTS WERE TAKEN FROM BOTH PARTIES AS WELL AS PHOTOS FROM THE INCIDENT. AFTER THAT WE WERE TOLD TO GET INTO OUR CARS AND PULL OVER BACK INTO THE PARKING LOT TO CLEAR UP THE AREA. I GOT BACK INTO MY VEHICLE AND STARTED TO DRIVE IT. MY STERRING WHEEL WAS FEELING WEIRD AND FLIMSY- IT FELT LIKE IT WAS BROKEN. I REACHED DOWN UNDER THE STERRING WHILE AND THE LEVER TO LOCK THE WHEEL HAD UNLOCKED. THE IMPACT ON MY VEHICLE WAS HARD.THE DRIVERS AIRBAG SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED- BUT IT DIDNT. THE WHEEL CAME OUT, BUT NO AIRBAG. THIS WAS EXTREMELY UNSAFE FOR MYSELF AND MY CLIENT WHOM ALREADY HAS DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. I SUFFERED INJURIES AND WENT TO THE HOSPITAL IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INCIDENT.",
