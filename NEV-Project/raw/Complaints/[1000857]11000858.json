THIS HAS RESULTED IN THE FOOT ACTIVATED OPEN/CLOSE BEING ACTIVATED UNINTENTIONALLY AND THE LIFT GATE COMING DOWN ON MY HEAD, RESULTING IN A BRUISE AND BUMP FROM THE LATCH. THIS COMPLAINT HAS BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE DEALER AND FORD MANAGEMENT. THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN RETURNED TO THE DEALER ON THREE OCCASIONS FOR REPAIR WITH NO SATISFACTORY RESULTS. I THINK THE VOLUME LEVEL SHOULD BE INCREASED SO IT CAN BE HEARD WHEN THE LIFT GATE IS GOING UP OR DOWN TO PREVENT FURTHER INJURY.     THANK YOU.",
