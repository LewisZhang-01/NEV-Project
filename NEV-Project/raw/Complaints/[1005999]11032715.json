        "summary": "LIKE MANY OTHERS WHO HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS ON THE FORD FREESTAR, I HAVE TO ADD MY COMPLAINT REGARDING MY 2004 FORD FREESTAR. FIRST OF ALL, WHEN I BOUGHT MY VAN USED ABOUT 4 YEARS AGO, I DID RESEARCH ON IT, AND LEARNED ABOUT THE ISSUE OF WATER GETTING INTO THE PCM. SO I TOOK THE VAN TO A FORD DEALERSHIP - CAMPBELL FORD IN NILES MICHIGAN - AND ONE OF THEIR MECHANICS DRIED AND SEALED THE PCM, ALONG WITH THE AREA AT THE BASE OF THE WINDSHIELD THAT IS PRONE TO LEAK. THAT WAS TWO YEARS AGO (THIS VAN ALSO HAD THE TORQUE CONVERTER WORK DONE BY THE PREVIOUS OWNER).   SO HERE'S THE PROBLEM I'M HAVING NOW: WHEN DRIVING, OCCASIONALLY FOR NO APPARENT REASON, MY RADIO GOES DEAD, NO TIME, NO DISPLAY, NO MUSIC, AND THEN THE BRAKE AND ABS LIGHT APPEAR ON THE DASH, ALONG WITH THE BATTERY LIGHT AND AIRBAG LIGHT. THIS LASTS FOR A FEW SECONDS, AND THEN EVERYTHING RETURNS TO NORMAL (SOMETIMES THE BATTERY LIGHT STAYS ON PERMANENTLY). WHEN THIS HAPPENS I LOSE NO POWER AND THE VAN DRIVES LIKE NORMAL. THAT MIGHT OCCUR 4 - 5 TIMES / OUTING. I REPLACED THE BATTERY A FEW DAYS AGO AND THIS HAS MADE NO DIFFERENCE.",
