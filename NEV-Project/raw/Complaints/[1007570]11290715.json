IT BECAME MORE THAN IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN AND I HAD TO STOP EVERY 10 SECONDS AND TURN MY CAR OFF AND BACK ON TO TRY AND GET IT HOME. I KNOW THAT MORE THAN A FAIR SHARE OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME VEHICLE HAVING THE EXACT PROBLEM. SUDDEN LOSS OF STEERING. I KNOW THAT THERE IS AN OPEN RECALL, BUT ITS NOT SHOWING MY VEHICLE HAS ANY CURRENT RECALLS, THOUGH THERE WAS ONE FOR THE POWER ASSISTED MOTOR THAT IS STILL OPEN  FROM WHAT I CAN SEE. I HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN CAER OF MY VEHICLE AND NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN, AM I CORRECT WITH TAKING IT TO THE DEALERSHIP STILL TO GET IT REPLACED FROM THE RECALL?",
