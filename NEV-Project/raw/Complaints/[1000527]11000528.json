I CAN PUSH THE GAS PEDAL ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND IT JUST KEEPS GOING THE SAME SPEED (ABOUT 2-5MPH). I HAVE ALMOST BEEN HIT ONCE WHEN PULLING INTO TRAFFIC AND ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT ONCE WHEN A CAR HAD TO SWERVE TO MISS ME. I NEVER KNOW WHEN OR IF THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN.   I TOOK IT INTO THE DEALER TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT AND THEY SAID AN UPDATE FOR THE TRANSMISSION WAS ISSUED AND THAT WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM.   WELL, THE SAME THING IS STILL HAPPENING SO I TOOK IT BACK AGAIN TO BE LOOKED AT. NOW THEY TELL ME HYUNDAI IS GOING TO RELEASE ANOTHER UPDATE SOON.   THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM AND I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE.",
