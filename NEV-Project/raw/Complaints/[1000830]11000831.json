CAN TURN THE KEY AND NOTHING HAPPENS.  I CAN POSSIBLY SIT THERE AND TURN THE IGNITION 10+ TIMES AND STILL NOTHING.  THOUGHT IT COULD BE A BAD SPOT IN THE NEW STARTER??  CLEANED BATTERY POSTS OFTEN AND NOW HAVE TREATED THE CONNECTIONS.  WOULD LIKE NOT TO RECEIVE ANOTHER CALL FROM LOVELY WIFE THAT THE VAN WOULD NOT START.  HAS TO BE SOMETHING WITH A CIRCUIT STAYING OPEN OR SOMETHING.      SAFETY ISSUE DUE TO NOT KNOWING IF YOUR CAR IS GOING TO START WHEN YOU ARRIVE TO A DESTINATION.    ISSUE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 2+ YEARS AND VAN HAS 100K MILES     LAST INSTANCE OF ISSUE: 23 JUNE 2017",
