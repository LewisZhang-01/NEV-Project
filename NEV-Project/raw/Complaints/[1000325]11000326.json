        "summary": "A/C CONDENSER.  THE A/C IN MY 2015 CHEVY TAHOE HAS GONE OUT TWICE IS THE PAST TWO-AND-A-HALF WEEKS.  THE FIRST TIME THEY FOUND THAT THE FREON WAS GONE.  THEY CHECKED AND COULD NOT LOCATE ANY LEAKS.  THE RECHARGED THE SYSTEM AND REPLACED FREON, ADDING DYE TO THE SYSTEM TO IDENTIFY FUTURE LEAKS.  TWO-AND-A-HALF WEEKS LATER, MY FREON WAS COMPLETELY GONE AGAIN AND THE DYE REVEALED THAT THE LEAK WAS DUE TO A FAULTY A/C CONDENSER.  THE INTERNET IS FULL OF THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS REGARDING THIS SAME ISSUE ON THIS SAME YEAR, MAKE AND MODEL OF VEHICLE, BUT GM\\CHEVROLET REFUSES TO ISSUE A RECALL TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEM.  THE PART IS ON A NATIONWIDE BACKORDER, AND EVEN MY LOCAL CHEVY DEALERSHIP CANNOT GET THE PART.  THEY CAN'T EVEN GIVE ME AN ESTIMATE ON WHEN THE PART WILL BE AVAILABLE.  OTHERS ARE REPORTING WAIT TIMES IN EXCESS OF 60 DAYS TO SECURE A REPLACEMENT A/C CONDENSER.  I CANNOT DRIVE MY VEHICLE UNTIL MY A/C FUNCTIONS, GIVEN THE EXTREME HIGH TEMPERATURES IN MY AREA.  WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS PROBLEM THAT YOU CAN'T EVEN GET A PART TO FIX IT, THIS SEEMS LIKE AN ISSUE WIDESPREAD ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY A MANUFACTURER RECALL.  MY DEALER HAS LOOKED FOR OEM, AFTER-MARKET, USED, AND REBUILT A/C CONDENSERS NATIONWIDE, AND CAN'T LOCATE A SINGLE ONE TO REPAIR MY VEHICLE.  OTHERS ONLINE ARE REPORTING THE SAME.  FORCE CHEVY TO ISSUE A RECALL AND FIX THIS SITUATION!",
