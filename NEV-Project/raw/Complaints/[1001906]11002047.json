THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO TUSTIN HYUNDAI MOTORS OF TUSTIN, CALIFORNIA WHERE THE ENGINE WAS REPLACED WITH A RE-MANUFACTURED ENGINE. THE CONTACT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION OF NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 17V226000 (ENGINE AND ENGINE COOLING). THE DEALER STATED THAT THE FAILURE WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE RECALL. FURTHERMORE, THE CONTACT STATED THAT THERE WAS AN OIL FLOW RESTRICTION, WHICH CAUSED HIGH OIL CONSUMPTION, DUE TO THE PREMATURE BEARING WEAR WITHIN THE ENGINE. AFTER THE INITIAL REPAIR, THE CONTACT HEARD A CLACKING NOISE COMING FROM THE ENGINE ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION DUE TO A LACK OF OIL. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND STATED THAT THE RE-MANUFACTURED ENGINE WOULD HAVE TO FAIL COMPLETELY BEFORE AUTHORIZATION OF A NEW ENGINE WOULD BE APPROVED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 155,000.",
