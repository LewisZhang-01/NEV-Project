THIS FREQUENT PROBLEM HAS BEEN REPORTED TO THE NHTSB NUMEROUS TIMES AND TO GM WITH NO RESULTS.  GM CUSTOMER SERVICE CLAIMS THAT THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS PROBLEM, BUT IF YOU GOOGLE: 2006 HUMMER3 STARTING PROBLEMS, YOU WILL SEE A LONG LIST OF EXACTLY THE SAME COMPLAINTS.  THIS SITUATION SHOULD WARRANT A RECALL AND REPAIR AT GM'S EXPENSE.  THE CURRENT REMEDY IS TO SIT AND WAIT 10 MINUTES UNTIL THE SECURITY SYSTEM RESETS AND THEN THE VEHICLE CAN BE STARTED.  THIS CONDITION OCCURS WITHOUT WARNING AND IS NOT COVERED AT ALL IN THE OWNERS MANUAL.",
