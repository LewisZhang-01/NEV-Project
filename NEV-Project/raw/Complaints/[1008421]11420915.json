        "summary": "Tried to apply the brakes and the brake pedal went to the floor without actuating the brakes.  This happened suddenly and with no warning of any kind prior to the failure.  I had to use the parking brake to bring the vehicle to a stop.  The \"BRAKE FLUID LOW\" warning came on in the instrument cluster. The warning and the failure happened simultaneously, i.e. there was no indication of a problem until the braking system failed entirely.  The vehicle had no braking action at all from the hydraulic brake system.  Upon inspection the seals in the master cylinder appear to have failed, pulling all of the brake fluid into the brake vacuum-booster.  It is my understanding that a problem identical to this one led to several accidents and a recall in the 2013-2015 F150.  Clearly the issue is not limited to those model years as my truck is a 2011.",
