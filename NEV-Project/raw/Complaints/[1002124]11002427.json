        "summary": "THE CAR HAD FEW RECALLS AND FEW WARRANTIES ISSUES SINCE I PURCHASE THE CAR.  FOR THE SPECIFIC, RIGHT NOW, MY CAR HAS A \"POWER STEERING ASSIST FAULT \"  FORD ISSUED A RECALL FOR THE MODEL FUSION YEAR 2011 RELATED TO THIS PROBLEM, THAT IS A MAJOR SAFETY PROBLEM BECAUSE THE STEERING WHEEL WILL LOCK IN PLACE. FORTUNATELY MINE LOCKED WHEN I START THE CAR.   I HAD AAA TOWED MY CAR TO MY MECHANIC, AND THEN FROM THERE TO THE FORD DEALER BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T HELP MY MECHANIC WITH INFORMATION UNLESS THE CAR WAS AT THEIR LOCATION FOR A DIAGNOSIS ( THAT I NEED TO PAY FOR IT), A DIAGNOSIS THAT MY MECHANIC DID FOR FREE.    NOW, THE RECALL THAT FORD HAS IN PLACE DO NOT INCLUDE MY VEHICLE, THEY SAID THAT THE VIN NUMBER IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL, AND THAT IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT:    SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THE SAME MODEL, SAME YEAR, SAME SPECIFIC PROBLEM.... BUT THEY REFUSE TO EXTEND THE RECALL TO MINE!     THE REPAIR, WHICH BTW, IS NOT A PART OF A VEHICLE THAT NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED, REPLACE OR MAINTAIN IN THE LIFETIME OF THE VEHICLE, WILL COST OVER $3,000.......  I CANNOT REPAIR THE CAR.    FORD CS, SUGGEST ME TO REPAIR THE CAR,  TELLING ME TO SAVE THE RECEIPT IN CASE FORD DECIDE TO EXTEND THE RECALL.    ADDITIONALLY, I WAS OFFERED 10% DISCOUNT.... WOW    I AM A SINGLE MOM, HAVE A SPECIAL NEED SON, LOST MY LONG TIME ( 17 1/2 YEARS) JOB, AND WORK ONLY PART TIME ... I AM DESPERATE!     I NEED TO HAVE THE CAR WORKING, I CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THAT MUCH MONEY AND I THINK THAT THIS IS INSANE !!   THE DEALER AND THE FORD CS TOLD ME THAT THEY CANNOT SHARE THEIR FINDINGS WITH THE CUSTOMER, BUT ONLY THE DECISION, WHICH IS TO NOT INCLUDE THE VEHICLE IN THE RECALL.",
