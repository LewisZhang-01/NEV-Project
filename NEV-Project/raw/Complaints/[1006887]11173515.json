        "summary": "DRIVING ON HIGHWAY AVERAGING 80 MPH. I WAS NOT USING CRUISE CONTROL. AFTER 30 MINUTES OF DRIVING THE VEHICLE BEGINS TO DECELERATE. I PRESSED THE GAS PEDAL FURTHER TO ACCELERATE, YET IT HAD NO EFFECT. THE VEHICLE SPEED DROPPED TO 60 MPH. I PUT ON HAZARDS. THE VEHICLE CONTINUED TO DECELERATE TO 50 MPH. THIS HAPPENED WITHIN A MATTER OF SECONDS. I IMMEDIATELY MADE MY WAY TO THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY. DURING THIS TIME, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT NEVER FLASHED, NOR DID ANY OTHER INDICATOR LIGHT COME ON. THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE WAS WELL BELOW THE HALFWAY POINT. I PARKED, AND RAISED THE HOOD TO EXAMINE THE VEHICLE. THE FLUIDS WERE ALL AT RECOMMENDED LEVELS. AFTER 5 MINUTES, I BEGAN TO DRIVE AGAIN. THE VEHICLE SLOWLY ACCELERATED AND WOULD NOT GO OVER 50 MPH. I PULLED OFF TO THE NEXT EXIT AND DROVE TO A GAS STATION. I DOUBLE CHECKED THE FLUIDS AND USED THE OWNERS MANUAL TO HELP IDENTIFY ANY DASHBOARD INDICATOR LIGHTS THAT MAY SIGNIFY THAT SOMETHING IS MALFUNCTIONING. NOTHING SHOWED. I KEPT THE CAR OFF FOR OVER 20 MINUTES. I STARTED THE CAR BACK UP AND IT RAN NORMALLY WITHOUT PROBLEMS. THERE HAS BEEN 10 OR MORE OTHER TIMES I CAN RECALL WHERE THIS HAS HAPPENED. THIS IS CRAP AND MAKES ME WISH I NEVER GOT THIS JUKE. I HAVE BEEN TO THE NISSAN DEALERS ALL AROUND ME AND NO ONE CAN EXPLAIN THIS PROBLEM TO ME. THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SORT OF RECALL TO FIX THIS DANGEROUS PROBLEM. I DO NOT NEED CARS ALMOST REAR ENDING ME AND DRIVERS PISSED OFF AT ME BECAUSE MY CAR WONT GO. AND WHO HAS TIME TO WAIT 20 TO 40 MINUTES TO WAIT FOR WHATEVER THE ISSUE IS TO CORRECT ITSELF!",
