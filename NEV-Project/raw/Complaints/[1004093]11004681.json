        "summary": "ELECTRONIC SHIFTER MODULE HAD GONE OUT. PARK REVERSE NEUTRAL IN AND DRIVE ARE THE ONLY FUNCTIONS AVAILABLE. TO DOWNSHIFT FROM DRIVE FOURTH, THIRD, SECOND, AND FIRST HAVE LOST ALL ABILITY.  PRIMARILY THE DRIVING OF THE VEHICLE IS THROUGH THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO AND THE ABILITY TO DOWNSHIFT IS NECESSARY TO AVOID COLLISION AND TO CLIMB THE STEEP HILLS.   NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF, BUT FOR ANYBODY ELSE WITH THIS PROBLEM FOR EXAMPLE: DRIVING TO AN EXIT RAMP FROM SPEEDS OF 65 AND NEEDING TO DECELERATE TO 25 WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT AND MAJOR WHERE ON THE BRAKE SYSTEM.   NOW FOR CLIMBING THE HILLS OF SAN FRANCISCO IN A HIGH GEAR PUTS A MAJOR STRESS ON THE TRANSMISSION. PLEASE TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE ELECTRONIC SHIFTER MODULE SHOULD BE RECALLED FOR SAFETY . THIS VEHICLE HAS ALREADY BEEN RECALLED FOR AN IGNITION AND HAS BEEN REPLACED BUT I RECEIVED SEVERAL NOTICES FROM JEEP STARTING OUT AS SIMPLE AND IS NICELY PUT HIS PLEASE SEE YOUR SERVICE DEALERSHIP THERE IS A RECALL AND TO THE EXTREME OF RECEIVING NOTICES  THAT SAID YOUR VEHICLE HAS A RECALL AND YOU ARE PUTTING OTHER PEOPLES LIVES IN DANGER BY NEGLECTING TO HAVE IT FIXED.  I HAVE DONE MY HOMEWORK AND THE IGNITION AND WAS TOLD FROM A DEALERSHIP THAT IT WAS NOT NECESSARY SINCE I ONLY USE THE KEY  WITH NO KEYCHAIN.    I HAVE ALSO DONE MY HOMEWORK ON THE ELECTRONIC SHIFTER MODULE AND THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE VIDEOS OR TESTIMONIES ABOUT THEIR JEEPS HAVING THE PROBLEM OF THE ABILITY NOT TO DOWNSHIFT THROUGH THE ELECTRONIC SHIFTER MODULE.   IN THE PAST 12 YEARS I PRAY THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO ACCIDENTS IN DIRECT RELATION TO THIS ELECTRONIC SHIFTER MODULE BUT IF YOU'RE A DRIVER YOU KNOW THAT EVERY GEAR ON THE VEHICLE IS THERE FOR A REASON AND RELY ON THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE.",
