        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING ON A BUSY ROAD AT 40MPH MY CAR SUDDENLY DOWNSHIFTED AND WOULD NOT MOVE. AS I TRIED PRESSING ON GAS TO ACCELERATE THE CAR SLOWLY WENT UP TO 5 ON THE SPEEDOMETER AND STOPPED MOVING AGAIN.  I LUCKILY DID NOT GET HIT FROM BEHIND OR CROSS MAIN ROAD TO GET INTO A SIDE STREET FOR ME TO SAFELY GET OUT OF VEHICLE AND CALL FOR A TOW.  SINCE PURCHASING THIS CAR USED 3 MONTHS AGO THIS HYBRID WOULD ALWAYS JERK WHEN DRIVING AS IF IT IS SLIPPING GEARS, BUT HAD REALIZED IT IS THE BLUE DRIVE MODE KICKING IN WHEN DRIVING.   THE REPAIR SHOP STATES THERE IS A DEFECT IN THE TRANSMISSION, UNFORTUNATLELY I AM NOT THE ORIGINAL OWNER WHICH WOULD BE COVERED UNDER 100,000. MY CAR HAS 95,000 BUT I AM SECOND OWNER WHICH HYUNDAI STATES IT ONLY COVERS UP TO 60,000.   PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS SAFETY ISSUE AND DEMAND A RECALL. I UNFORTUNATLEY HAVE TO GET THE CAR FIXED SINCE I AM MAKING PAYMENTS ON THE LOAN BUT AM GOING TO FRIGHTENED ON DRIVING THIS CAR IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS HAPPENING AGAIN. I CALLED YOUR HOTLINE AND THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER CASES LIKE THIS AS WELL AS PEOPLE REPORTING THIS ONLINE.   I AM DOCUMENTING EVERYTHING IF I NEED TO CLAIM A LEMON AND WOULD LIKE YOUR HELP AND RESPONSE TO WHAT AND WHY HYUNDAI IS NOT RECALLING THIS CAR.",
