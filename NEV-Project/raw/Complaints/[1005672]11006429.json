        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AT 70PMH, TRIED TO SLOW ENTERING A CURVE ONTO ANOTHER HIGHWAY, 271S TO 71S, IN OHIO AND HAD TO HIT MY BRAKES HARD BECAUSE TRAFFIC JAMMED SUDDENLY. I DIDN'T HAVE BRAKES AT ALL, MY ABS NEVER KICKED IN. I WENT OFF THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY AND EVEN THEN COULDN'T STOP WITH MY FOOT ALL THE WAY DOWN.I NEARLY HIT THE PERSON IN FRONT OF ME GOING ABOUT 50+. I TOOK IT DIRECTLY TO MY MECHANIC WHO REPLACED MY MASTER CYLINDER AGAIN (2X IN 5 MONTHS) AND AFTER HE WAS DONE THE PEDAL NO LONGER BRAKES PROPERLY. WHEN ATTEMPTING TO STOP THE PEDAL IS NEARLY TO THE FLOOR. IT IS AKIN TO NOT HAVING PEDALS AT ALL. I HAVE TO STAND ON IT TO STOP AND EVEN THEN ITS THE PANIC FEELING OF BEING UNABLE TO STOP. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT COULD KILL AND I'VE READ MANY OTHER STORIES OF PEOPLE WITH SIMILAR ISSUES WITH BRAKING. FORD SAID THAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES WHEN MY MECHANIC CALLED AND GAVE NO FURTHER REASONING TO IT. I DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING A CAR I'VE HAD A YEAR THAT'S NOT EVEN A DECADE OLD.",
