I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A DEALER AND WAS TOLD THE BRAKES AND ROTORS WERE WORN OUT AND NEEDED TO BE CHANGED. COST: $970 AND CHANGE. A CAR WITH SUCH LOW MILEAGE SHOULD NOT NEED NEW BRAKES AND ROTORS.THE DEALERSHIP COULD NOT GIVE ME A REASON FOR THE WEAR BUT INSISTED THE WORK WAS NECESSARY AND THAT THEY HAD THE CAR APART AND READY TO GO. BECAUSE IT IS A 2013 THERE WAS NO WARRANTEE SO I HAD TO PAY THE ENTIRE BILL OUT OF POCKET.",
