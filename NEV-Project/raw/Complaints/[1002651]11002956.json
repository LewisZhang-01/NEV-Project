        "summary": "I ARRIVED HOME AND WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND MY FIANC FOLLOWED ABOUT 30 SECONDS LATER. I LEFT THE CAR RUNNING AS I INTENDED TO GO OUT FOR A SHORT TRIP AFTER DROPPING HER OFF. WE WERE BOTH ON OUR DECK SAYING GOODBYE WHEN WE SAW MY CAR START MOVING BACKWARDS, THIS WAS ABOUT 60 SECONDS AFTER SHE HAD LEFT THE CAR. I ASSUMED IT WAS BEING STOLEN AS IT WAS RUNNING, SO I RAN OUT TO TRY TO STOP IT. I FOUND THE CAR HAD BARKED INTO A FENCE ACROSS THE ALLEY AND HAD STOPPED. THERE WAS NO DRIVER IN THE CAR WHEN IT MOVED. I MOVED THE CAR BACK AND BEGAN INVESTIGATION AS TO WHAT HAPPENED. THE FINDINGS WERE AS FOLLOWS  1. THE CAR WAS IN PARK WHEN IT WAS PARKED BUT LEFT RUNNING  2. THE DISPLAY THAT SHOWS BACK UP CAMERA WHEN IN REVERSE WAS NOT ACTIVATED AT ANY TIME WE WERE IN CAR.  3. THE EMERGENCY BRAKE WAS NOT APPLIED ALLOWING THE CAR TO MOVE.  4. TRYING TO RECREATE THE INCIDENT IT WAS FOUND THAT IF THE CAR IS IN REVERSE AS SOON AS THE FOOT BRAKE IS RELEASED THE CAR STARTS TO MOVE IMMEDIATELY.  5. I TRIED TO RECREATED BY DRIVING AROUND THE BLOCK AND LEAVE IT IN REVERSE, AGAIN AS SOON AS THE BRAKE IS RELEASED THE CAR MOVES IMMEDIATELY. THIS WAS DUPLICATED 10 TIMES TO SHOW CONSISTENCY.  6. THE CAR WAS STATIONARY THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT FOR ABOUT 45-60 SECONDS WITH NO OCCUPANTS PRIOR TO IT MOVING.    I CHECKED WITH THE DEALER AND BECAUSE IT WAS INTERMITTENT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ADDRESS IT. I CALLED CHRYSLER CANADA AND THEY GAVE ME A FILE NUMBER 31926065 AND STATED THAT UNLESS THEY COULD DUPLICATE THE CONDITION THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO AND I SHOULD CALL BACK WHEN IT HAPPENS AGAIN. I EXPRESSED CONCERNS FOR OTHERS THAT MAY HAVE THE SAME ISSUE AS I OFTEN HAVE CHILDREN IN THE BACK ALLEY PLAYING.",
