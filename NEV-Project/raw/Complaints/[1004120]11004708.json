UPON INVESTIGATION TOYOTA BEGAN USING SOY-BASED WIRING IN THEIR VEHICLES INSTEAD OF PETROLEUM-BASED AND DIDN'T NOTIFY THEIR CUSTOMERS.  SOY-BASED PRODUCTS IN VEHICLES HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO \"ATTRACT\" RODENTS VERSUS PETROLEUM BASED PRODUCTS.  MY 2012 TUNDRA WAS STILL UNDER WARRANTY AND TOYOTA DENIED SAID WARRANTY BECAUSE IT WASN'T A \"FAILURE\" OF THEIR PARTS.  THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT ACCELERATE PROPERLY OR STEER PROPERLY BECAUSE THE TRACTION CONTROL AND ECM HAD FAILED.  THIS COULD CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR HARM DUE TO AN UNSUSPECTING INTERRUPTION IN SPEED AND TRAFFIC FLOW, AS A RESULT OF WIRING SEPARATION OCCURRING WHILE OPERATING THE VEHICLE.",
