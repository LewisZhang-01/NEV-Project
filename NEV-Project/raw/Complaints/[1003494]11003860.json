LN APRIL 2011 WE BOUGHT A 2011 LEXUS E350 FROM, POHANKA LEXUS IN CHANTILLY (13909 LEE JACKSON MEMORIAL HWY, CHANTILLY, VA 20151,  POHANKALEXUSCHANTILLY.COM, (703) 968-9100).  IN SEPTEMBER 2016 WE RECEIVED A E LETTER INFORMING US OF A DANGEROUS CONDITION REQUIRING A RECALL AND IMMEDIATE REPAIRS.  THE CONDITION WAS THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG COULD EXPLODE DURING DEPLOYMENT AND CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH TO VEHICLE OCCUPANTS.    SINCE THEN, WE HAVE CALLED POHANKA LEXUS NUMEROUS TIME AND ALL WE GET IS THE CLASSIC RUNAROUND THAT THEY ARE \"WORKING THE PROBLEM.\" THAT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH.  THEY SHOULD EITHER FIX THIS DANGEROUS CONDITION OR GIVE US A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE OF SIMILAR YEAR, MODEL AND CONDITION.  THE DEALER HAS NOT REPAIRED THE VEHICLE.",
