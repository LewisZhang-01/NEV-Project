THE LETTER STATED \"THE POWER STEERING ASSIST MAY DEACTIVATE, INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH.\" I CALLED MERCEDES BENZ USA AND WAS TOLD THEY COULD NOT GUARANTEE 100 % THAT THE CAR WAS SAFE TO DRIVE. THEY STATED THEY HAVE NO PARTS TO FIX PROBLEM AND WOULD SEND ANOTHER LETTER AS PARTS BECOME AVAILABLE. I EXPLAINED I DO MOUNTAIN DRIVING WEEKLY WHICH INCLUDES CHANGING WEATHER CONDITIONS THRU OUT THE YEAR, THEREFORE THIS RESPONSE IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. I WAS TOLD IT WAS UP TO ME IF I CHOSE TO PARK THE CAR AND NOT DRIVE IT UNTIL THEY HAVE PARTS  (IN A MONTH OR SO). THE GENTLEMAN TOLD ME THEY DON'T  EVEN KNOW WHAT THE EXACT PROBLEM IS. MERCEDES BENZ USA DOES NOT OFFER ANY HELP FOR THIS SITUATION.",
