AFTER GAING CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE, MANUVERED VEHICLE TO FIRST AVAILABLE EXIT ONTO A SERVICE ROAD. VEHICLE  CONTINUED TO MAKE LOUD POPPING NOISE EVERYTIME I PRESSED ON THE ACCELERATOR. BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE NOISE WAS, MY GRANDCHILDREN AND I WERE STARTLED AFRAID. I PULLED ONTO A VACANT LOT AND TURNED THE MOTOR OFF. I HAD TO CALL SOMEONE TO COME AND PICK MY GRANDCHILDREN UP AND CALLED MY INSURANCE COMPANY. THEY ARRANGED FOR A TOW. ALTHOUGH I WAS PARKED OUT OF TRAFFIC, SITTING THERE ALONE, WAITING FOR THE TOW TRUCK FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS. IT WAS DARK BY THE TIME THE TOW TRUCK ARRIVED. MY HUSBAND DID NOT GET OFF UNTIL AROUND 8:00PM. I WAS VERY AFRAID!!! I TAKE MEDICATION AND TREATMENT FOR MY NERVES. THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN ON 11-13-2017 AFTER THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN -REPAIRED!!! -THE FIRST TIME.",
