THE REAR WINDOW HAS BECOME UNGLUED CAUSING POSSIBLE SERIOUS INJURY, HAD IT COME TOTALLY UNGLUED IT COULD HAVE CREATED A SERIOUS INJURY SIMILAR TO WHAT SNOW COULD DO IF NOT CLEANED OFF BEFORE LEAVING FOR A TRIP IN YOUR CAR. I HAVE NOTIFIED CHRYSLER AND THEY WILL TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY IN THE REPAIR. THEIR REPLY, THE WARRANTY IS EXPIRED! I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THIS ISSUE IS NOT BEING TAKEN MORE SERIOUSLY? THERE HAVE BEEN MANY COMPLAINTS FILED WITH THIS SAME ISSUE. A REAR WINDOW THAT COULD BE RELEASED INTO THE REAR OF A HIGHWAY OR FOR THAT MATTER ANY ROAD COULD CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY TO THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE OR OTHER DRIVERS ON THE ROAD. I HOPE THIS MATTER IS TAKEN SERIOUS AND SOMEONE FOLLOWS UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE FOR A VEHICLE THAT HAS BEEN ASSEMBLED WITH FAULTY GLUE OR POOR DESIGN! P.S. THIS WINDOW BECAME LOOSE WHEN MY WIFE HAD NOTICED IT WAS STARTING TO BECOME LOOSE WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY DOING ABOUT 60 MPH. SHE THEN HAD TO APPLY HER BRAKES AND REMAIN AT A SLOW SPEED ON THE HIGHWAY WHICH IS A DANGER IN IT SELF.",
