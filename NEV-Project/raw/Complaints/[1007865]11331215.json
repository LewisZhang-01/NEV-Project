WHEN THE SYSTEM ERRORS THE EMERGENCY BRAKING DOES NOT FUNCTION, THE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL DOES NOT FUNCTION, AND EVEN THE TRADITIONAL CRUISE CONTROL WILL NOT SET. TURNING CAR OFF AND ONE DOES RESET THE ISSUE BUT IT KEEPS APPEARING AT RANDOM TIMES WHEN I DRIVE THE CAR. I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO DEALER MULTIPLE TIMES THEY TELL ME THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING UNLESS THE WARNING LIGHT IS ON WHEN THEY HAVE THE VEHICLE. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE I PURCHASED THE CAR BRAND NEW IN NOVEMBER 2019.  *TR",
