THE UPPER LEVEL MANAGEMENT DENIED MY RIGHT TO HAVE THE TRUCK FIXED. I HAVE SPENT 1400.00 DOLLARS TO  FIX AND KEEP THE TRUCK ON THE ROAD SAFELY. THE RECALL ENDED EARLY WITHOUT NOTICE. I HAVE RECEIPTS FROM MY DEALERSHIP OF THE REPAIR. IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION WHEN ROUTINE MAINTENANCE WAS BEING PERFORMED. THAT STARTED MY INQUIRY WITH TOYOTA.",
