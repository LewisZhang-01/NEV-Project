        "summary": "ALL 4 ELECTRIC DRUM BRAKES ON THE REFLECTION FIFTH WHEEL CAMPER TRAILER WERE CONTAMINATED WITH GREASE FROM THE AXLES.  AFTER CHECKING BRAKES BECAUSE OF POOR TRAILER BRAKING WHILE TOWING THE FIFTH WHEEL TRAIL, I FOUND THAT ALL 4 BRAKE'S SHOES WERE BARELY WORN AFTER 2 YEARS OF USE. THE BRAKE SHOES HAD GREASE ON THEM AS WELL AS THE ELECTRIC MAGNET THAT ACTIVATES THE BRAKES. THE GREASE CONTAMINATION CAUSED FAULTY OPERATION OF THE BRAKES.  NUMEROUS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM.  THE MANUFACTURER LIPPERT HAS SUPPOSEDLY AFTER SEVERAL YEARS MADE SOME CHANGES, BUT STILL BRAND NEW CAMPER TRAILER ARE BEING FOUND WITH BRAKE GREASE CONTAMINATION.",
