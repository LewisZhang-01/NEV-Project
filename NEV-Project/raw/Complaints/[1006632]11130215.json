IT ONLY HAPPENS WHEN YOU FIRST START THE CAR AND BEGIN TO ACCELERATE, WHICH IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE YOU ARE USUALLY PULLING INTO TRAFFIC IN THOSE MOMENTS. I HAVE BEEN CROSSING BUSY ROADS MANY TIMES WHEN THE ENGINE COMPLETELY STALLS OUT. IT IS HARD TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AT THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE IT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN, AND IT DOESN'T TURN ON A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT. THE FORD DEALERSHIP HAS BEEN UNABLE TO DIAGNOSE THIS PROBLEM FOR MONTHS, LEAVING ME DRIVING A DEATH TRAP. IT FINALLY HAPPENED ENOUGH TIMES IN A ROW YESTERDAY THAT IT TURNED ON A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT, FORD IS ABLE TO REPLACE THE PART NOW. I WAS STANDING NEXT TO SOMEONE AT FORD WHO HAD THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM, AND MANY OTHER DRIVERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS AS WELL.",
