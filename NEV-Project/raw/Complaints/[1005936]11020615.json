AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES I WAS ABLE TO RESTART MY VEHICLE. THE SECOND TIME IT HAPPENED I WAS ONE THE WAY TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE DEALERSHIP CALLED ME BACK TO INFORM ME THAT MY VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN FOR 26 MILES AND COULD NOT DUPLICATE. I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING ONLINE TO SEE IF THERE HAVE BEEN ANY ISSUES. BACK IN 2013 AN INVESTIGATION WAS STARTED FOR THIS ISSUE. I SPOKE WITH THE DEALERSHIP AND THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT TOLD ME THEY COULD NOT DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THE CARS COMPUTERS DID NOT THROW A CODE. NOT ONLY DID NOTHING HAPPEN FORD DID NOT MENTION ANY TSB THAT WOULD HELP OR FIX THIS ISSUE, AFTER I ASKED ABOUT ANY TSB THAT WOULD HELP OR FIX. STILL I GOT NOTHING FROM THE DEALERSHIP.",
