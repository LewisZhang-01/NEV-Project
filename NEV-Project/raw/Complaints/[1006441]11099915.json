        "summary": "THE VEHICLE DOES A STUDDERING AND STALLING. IN 2015, FORD SAID THEY FIXED IT AND THAT SOME OF THE STUDDERING IS BECAUSE IT'S A 4 CYL VEHICLE. IN MAY 2018 I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK STATING THE SAME ISSUE BUT WORST. THEY SAID IT'S THE TCM AND IT WOULD COST ME $1850. I COMPLAINED TO FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND THEY EXTENDED THE WARRANTY. FORD SAID THEY FIXED IT. THE NEXT DAY I HAD TO BRING THE CAR BACK BECAUSE THE DASHBOARD SAID \"TRANSMISSION OVERHEATING PLEASE STOP\" THEN IT STALL ON ME IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC. I TOOK IT BACK TO THEM AND ASKED WHAT DID THEY FIXED. THEY HAD THE CAR FOR 2 DAYS THEN CALLED ME TO TELL ME IT'S THE CLUTCH AND IT'S NOT COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY AND IT COSTS $2400. THE CLUTCH IS PART OF THE TRANSMISSION SO WHY ISN'T IT? THEY ARE NOW TELLING ME BECAUSE MY CAR HAS 94000 MILES ON IT THAT IT IS NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR. WHO BUYS A BRAND NEW VEHICLE FOR IT TO CONK OUT ON THEM AT 94000? THEY WILL NOT FIX MY CAR WITHOUT ME PAYING FOR IT. THIS IS A DEFECTIVE PART THAT FORD HAS AND THEY REFUSE TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THE MATTER AND RESOLVE IT. I HAD TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST FORD REGARDING THIS. SEVERAL OTHERS ARE NOW BEING COMPENSATED BUT THEY ARE RESIDENTS OF CA WHICH HAS STRICTER LEMON LAWS. THE SUIT IS NOW ON HOLD.",
