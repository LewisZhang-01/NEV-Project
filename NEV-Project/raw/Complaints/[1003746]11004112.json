THE HIGH BEAMS WILL WORK FROM THE \"FLASH TO PASS\" FEATURE WITH THE TURN SIGNAL STALK.  THIS FAILURE OCCURRED SUDDENLY. FORTUNATELY JUST BEFORE I ENTERED THE HIGHWAY   THIS SEEMS PRECISELY THE LIGHTING CONTROL MODULE PROBLEM THAT FORD COVERS FOR THE CROWN VIC AND MARQUIS VEHICLES UNDER RECALL 15S39.   THE TOWN CAR IS THE SAME PANTHER PLATFORM AS THE \"COVERED\" VEHICLES, AND CERTAINLY WITHIN THE SAME YEAR RANGE AS COVERED IN THE RECALL.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  MINE IS A \"HARD\" FAILURE.. NOT INTERMITTENT.  THE VEHICLE HAS NO HEADLIGHTS AT THIS MOMENT.   I VISITED THE LOCAL FORD DEALER TODAY AND THEY CONFIRMED THAT THE TOWN CAR WAS NOT COVERED UNDER FORD 15S39.",
