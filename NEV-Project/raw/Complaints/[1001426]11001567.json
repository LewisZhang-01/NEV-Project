        "summary": "PURCHASED A FACTORY DEMO MINI COUNTRYMAN DEC, 28TH 2016 WITH 4,599 MILES ON THE ODOMETER.   THE FACTORY SUPPLIED TIRES ARE GOODYEAR EFFICIENCY GRIP RUN FLAT 225/45/R18. AT APPRX 13,000 DURING SERVICE AT THE DEALERSHIP I WAS SHOWN A \"BUBBLE\" IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDEWALL. NO DAMAGE TO RIM NOR WAS THERE ANY COSMETIC INDICATIONS OF AN IMPACT. TIRE IS CRACKING AROUND THE EGG SIZED BUBBLE. IT IS INCREDIBLE HOW LARGE THIS IS CONSIDERING I HAVE BEEN IN THE AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS FOR 21 YEARS. TODAY APPRX 6 HOURS AGO I NOTICED A SMALLER BUT EQUALLY ALARMING \"BUBBLE\" IN THE SIDEWALL OF THE FRONT DRIVER TIRE. SINCE FINDING THE 2ND COMPROMISED SIDEWALL, A QUICK INTERNET SEARCH SHOWS THIS IS A TIRE WITH A HUGE REPUTATION FOR \"SIDEWALL GOOSE EGGS\". THIS IS A HUGE FINANCIAL BLOW FOR OUR LARGE BARELY MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY. I AM APPALLED AT THE NONEXISTENT WARRANTY TIRE MANUFACTURERS ACTUALLY HAVE TO BACK UP.  A DANGEROUS PRODUCT AND THE CONSUMER IS PENALIZED.  LIFE THREATENING PRODUCTS SHOULD BE A NO QUESTIONS ASKED REPLACEMENT WITH LABOR COSTS COVERED.",
