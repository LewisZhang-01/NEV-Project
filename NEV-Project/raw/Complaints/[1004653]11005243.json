        "summary": "THIS REPORT IS RELATED TO A KNOWN AND WIDESPREAD COMPUTER GLITCH IN LATE MODEL GM CARS.  THE GLITCH SEEMS TO BE TRIGGERED BY OTHER SYSTEM FAULTS WHEN THE CAR IS IN MOTION CAUSING MULTIPLE FAILURES RENDERING THE CAR UNABLE TO MAINTAIN SPEED OVER 20 MPH OR SO AND ALSO AFFECTING THE BRAKING SYSTEM.    PLEASE WATCH THIS VIDEO HTTPS://YOUTU.BE/HBVAOIIXNXY AND THEN READ THE COMMENTS.  THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS ACROSS A VARIETY OF GM MODELS INCLUDING THE 2017 TRAVERSE.  IT IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AS THE CARS BECOME SERIOUSLY INCAPACITATED WHEN THE GLITCH OCCURS.  THERE IS NO CLEAR FAILURE OCCURRING AND THERE ARE NO FAULTS RECORDED IN THE CAR'S MODULES MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE AND REPAIR.  IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE VIDEO I TOOK TO PROVE IT WAS HAPPENING THE DEALERSHIP WOULD HAVE SENT US AWAY AGAIN.  PLEASE WATCH THE VIDEO, EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW IS IN THERE.  PEOPLE CONTINUE TO COMMENT ON OUR VIDEO BECAUSE IT IS STILL HAPPENING!  THERE IS A REPORT FOR A 2017 TRAVERSE IN THE COMMENTS SECTION!  THANK YOU!",
