THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT  HAS CAME ON AND OFF NUMEROUS TIMES, FLASHING STABILIZATION AND TRACTION SWITCHING ON AND OFF.  I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AT LEAST FIVE TIMES EACH TIME THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY VEHICLE SECOND TO THE LAST TIME THEY STATED I NEEDED A NEW FUEL PUMP WHICH THEY REPLACED AND THE PROBLEM CONTINUED WITH IN TWO DAYS  AND CONTINUES TO THIS DAY .  THE LAST TIME I TOOK IT IN THEY STATED THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH GM VEHICLES FROM 2013 TO 2017 CAUSING STALLING HESITATION LACK OF PERFORMANCE IN A SETTING IN HIGH AMBIENT TEMPERATURES AND THERE IS NO FIX FOR IT .   I BELIEVE THIS IS A GREAT SAFETY RISK  FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE IN HIGH CLIMATE AREAS .",
