THERE HAVE BEEN TONS OF OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME CADILLAC AND SAME EXACT PROBLEM. THEY WILL NOT DO A RECALL AND THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE DRIVING AT NIGHT. THERE HAS TO BE SOMEHOW TO GET GM TO FIX THIS ISSUE BEFORE SOMEONE GETS SERIOUSLY INJURED! I AM HAVING TO TRY AND REPLACE THESE POORLY DESIGNED LIGHTS THAT DO NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH SAFE ROAD VISIBILITY WITH AFTER MARKET HEADLAMPS.  I DO NOT BELIEVE I SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR THESE REPLACEMENT LIGHTS BUT I DO NOT WANT ANY OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS TO DIE IN A CRASH CAUSED BY THESE OEM LIGHTS.  GM SHOULD SETUP A NATIONWIDE RECALL ON ALL OF THESE VEHICLES FITTED WITH THESE LIGHTS",
