        "summary": "I OWN A 2017 KIA SORENTO WITH 45,000 MILES. MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT KEPT COMING ON ALONG WITH ENGINE NOISES. EACH TIME I WOULD BRING IT INTO LAYTON, UT KIA SERVICE CENTER, I WAS TOLD IT WAS JUST O2 SENSORS AND ONE TIME IT NEEDED THE ENGINE HARNESS REPLACED.  JUST 3 WEEKS AFTER MY LAST VISIT TO THE SERVICE CENTER, I WAS DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY AND MY CAR JUST SUDDENLY LOST POWER AND WENT LIMP. I HAD IT TOWED TO THE SERVICE CENTER WHERE THEY TOLD ME I NEED A NEW ENGINE AND IT WON'T BE COVERED UNDER MY WARRANTY STATING IT WAS CAUSED BY LACK OF MAINTENANCE CAUSING ENGINE SLUDGE. BECAUSE WE HAD MY HUSBANDS COMPANY CHANGE OUR OIL SOME OF THE TIME ( KIA ACTUALLY DID EMISSIONS AND CHANGED IT 3 WEEKS PRIOR) THEY WOULD NOT ACCEPT THEIR DOCUMENTATION ON THIS. THERE IS A RECALL FOR THIS EXACT THING HAPPENING ON SAME YEAR, MAKE AND MODEL BUT ONLY FOR 4 CYLINDER AND WE OWN A 6 CYLINDER. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A DEFECT WITH THE CAR.",
