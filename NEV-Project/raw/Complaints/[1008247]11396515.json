THIS CAN CAUSE A CONCUSSION AND CAN CAUSE THE DRIVER TO LOOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE AFTER BEING STRUCK IN THE HEAD.  THE CAUSE IS A CHEAP PLASTIC PIN THAT IS UNDER CONSTANT PRESSURE AND HAS DETERIORATED OVER TIME AND RELEASE WITHOUT WARNING.   THIS KNOWN POTENTIAL PROBLEM HAS NOT HAPPENED TO ME YET.  BUT JEEP (FCA) ISSUED A WARNING AND EXTENDED THE WARRANTY BUT HAS NOT YET ISSUED A RECALL TO FIX THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM.  THEY ARE ONLY FIXING THIS IF IT HAS DEPLOYED, LEAVING ALL OTHER CUSTOMERS WORRYING AND WAITING FOR A POTENTIAL HIT TO THE HEAD ANYTIME WHILE DRIVING.  THERE ALREADY IS A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST FCA IN FLORIDA.",
