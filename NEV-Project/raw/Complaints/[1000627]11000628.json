AFTER RECEIVING NOTICE THE PART WAS AVAILABLE I CALLED THE DEALER TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT. THEY COULDN'T GET ME IN FOR 2 WEEKS. I DROPPED THE TRUCK OFF AT RON TONKIN DODGE IN MILWAUKIE OR. THEY CALLED AND NOTIFIED ME THAT THE PART WAS BACK ORDERED FOR ANOTHER MONTH. I LIVE 45 MILES AWAY AND MAKING ARRAIGNMENTS FOR A PICK UP RIDE TO AND FROM DEALER IS NOT EASY. WHY AM I GETTING LETTERS TELLING ME THE PARTS ARE AVAILABLE WHEN THEY ARE NOT. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER ALMOST A YEAR FROM THE TIME I REGISTERED ON LINE UNTIL TODAY. I THOUGHT I HAD THE TRUCK SOLD WITH THE STIPULATION I HAD ALL RECALLS AND SERVICE UP TO DATE. THE BUYER DOES NOT WANT TO WAIT FOR A MONTH. THEY WILL BUY ANOTHER TRUCK. AFTER ALL THIS, I AM NOT HAPPY.  I TRIED THE PHONE NUMBERS ON THE NOTIFICATION, I GET A VERY FAST BUSY SIGNAL. I HOPE NO ONE IS INJURED DURING THE WAIT.",
