TRUCK HAS TROUBLE STARTING AND WILL CRANK BUT NOT TURN OVER AS IF OUT OF FUEL. BATTERY, ALTERNATOR AND STARTER WERE CHECKED AND ARE PERFECT. I WAS HAVING TROUBLE THE PAST FEW WEEKS STARTING THE TRUCK, NOW I WENT TO START IT AND IT WILL NOT START NO MATTER WHAT. NOT A BATTERY ISSUE AS THE LIGHTS ALL TURN ON. IT MUST BE A TIPM ISSUE AND I HAVE NOTICED THAT OTHER ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS IN THE CAR ACT ODDLY AT TIMES.",
