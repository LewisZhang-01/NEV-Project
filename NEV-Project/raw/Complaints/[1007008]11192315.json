        "summary": "THE FRAME ON MY 2000 TOYOTA 4RUNNER IS RUSTED OUT ON ONE SIDE OF IT, IT WAS JUST THE SIDE, BUT NOW THERE IS RUST HOLES IN THE BOTTOM OF IT AS WELL. THIS IS A VERY BIG ISSUE AND COULD END UP TOTALING MY TRUCK IF I'M NOT WILLING TO SPEND THOUSANDS ON A NEW FRAME/REPAIR. THESE 4RUNNERS ARE KNOWN FOR BEING RELIABLE, BUT ALSO FOR TERRIBLY MADE FRAMES, AND I HAVE RUN INTO THAT UNFORTUNATE CASE. PLEASE ACTUALLY LOOK INTO RECALLING AND REPLACING THESE FRAMES, I KNOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE WITH THIS SAME ISSUE, AND IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WHY OTHER TRUCKS EXCEPT FOR THE 4RUNNER WERE RECALLED. EVERYONE WITH ONE OF THESE MODELS WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE A RECALL ON THESE FRAMES. THANK YOU, [XXX] (DO NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC PHOTO OF THE RUST ON FRAME, BUT I DO HAVE ONE OF THE RUST ON THE BODY, JUST TO GIVE YOU AN UNDERSTANDING, THE FRAME IS WAY MORE SEVERE THOUGH)    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
