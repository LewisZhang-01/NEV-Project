        "summary": "MY CAR IS CURRENTLY AT 76K MILES. SINCE AROUND 20K MILES, MY CAR HAS HAD ISSUES WITH STARTING THAT HAPPENS INTERMITTENTLY, SLOW/NO RESPONSE FROM PUSH BUTTON START, SLOW/NO RESPONSE WITH SMART ENTRY SYSTEM WHEN LOCKING/UNLOCKING DOORS. ALL OF THESE ISSUES ARE VERY INTERMITTENT. TO GO INTO MORE DETAIL ABOUT THE STARTING ISSUE, THE CAR WOULD START COMPLETELY, BUT THEN SHORTLY AFTER THE RPM WOULD DROP TO 0 AND THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS WOULD STAY ON. WHEN TRYING TO PUSH THE START BUTTON AGAIN, IT WOULD TRY TO CRANK FOR 15 SECONDS. IT'S NECESSARY TO COMPLETELY POWER OFF THE CAR TO PROPERLY START THE CAR. SOMETIMES THE ISSUE PRESENTS ITSELF IMMEDIATELY AFTER. THESE ISSUES HAPPEN WITH BOTH KEY FOBS EVEN AFTER SWITCHING TO FRESH BATTERIES. I'VE TAKEN IT TO JEEP DEALERSHIP 4-5 TIMES WITH NO RESOLUTION. THEY HAVE REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP RELAY TWICE FOR ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE STARTING ISSUE. THEY WERE NEVER ABLE TO DUPLICATE OR NO CODES WOULD PRESENT THEMSELVES. I HAVE STRONG SUSPICION OF THE TIPM (TOTALLY INTEGRATED POWER MODULE) FAILING, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY $1200 TO REPLACE. EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY, JEEP WILL NOT REPLACE UNTIL DUPLICATED. I EVEN LEFT THE CAR AT JEEP FOR A WEEK ONE OF THOSE VISITS. THE ISSUES HAPPEN ALMOST EVERY OTHER DAY OR ON A VERY BAD WEEK, EVERY DAY THE CAR IS USED.  JEEP CUSTOMER SERVICE IS VERY POOR AND I'VE BEEN STUCK WITH THIS ISSUE FOR WAY TOO LONG. THE STARTING ISSUE EVEN HAPPENED TODAY, TWICE.",
