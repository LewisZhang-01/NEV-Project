AS I WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE STALLED, ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND A WARNING MESSAGE SAID THE VEHICLE WAS \"SLOWING DOWN\" (IT STALLED COMPLETELY). I WAS UNABLE TO DRIFT INTO THE RIGHT LANE AND FORCED TO ABANDON MY CAR INTO THE CENTER LANE - USED FOR MERGING FROM OTHER LANES OF TRAFFIC. POLICE RESPONDED BUT NO REPORT WAS FILED. OFFICER SUGGESTED I LEAVE THE VEHICLE FOR MY OWN SAFETY & WHEN TOW TRUCK ARRIVED TO REQUEST THE AUTO BE TOWED TO A SAFE SPOT FOR REMOVAL OF PERSONAL ITEMS. THIS SITUATION WAS NOT ONLY DANGEROUS TO MYSELF BUT OTHERS. A CRASH COULD HAVE BEEN THE RESULT. ACCORDING TO DEALER, NO RECALL ON THIS ISSUE. DID HAVE A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM. LESS THAN 10,000 MILES ON CAR APPROX 18 MOS OLD. DEALER HOPES GM FIX WILL WORK, BUT I AM NOW NERVOUS ABOUT DRIVING THE VEHICLE.",
