REPAIR SHOP WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN FINDING REPLACEMENT PART AT LOCAL AUTO PARTS DEALERS (E.G., ADVANCED AUTO, ETC.) AND WAS TOLD THAT LOCAL CHEVY DEALERSHIP HAD PURCHASED ENTIRE STOCK OF RESPECTIVE A/C CONDENSERS AND THAT PARTS WERE BACKORDERED. AFTER CALLING LOCAL CHEVY DEALER, THEY WERE FAMILIAR WITH ISSUE AND SAID THEY \"WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THERE WAS A RECALL\" BECAUSE THEY WERE SEEING A LOT OF THESE ISSUES. WHEN I TOOK THE CAR TO GET REPAIRED THE SERVICE REP SAID, \"I HOPE CUSTOMERS ARE REIMBURSED FOR THESE REPAIRS.\" THERE SEEMS TO BE A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM WITH THESE CONDENSERS AND CHEVY IS AWARE OF IT, AT LEAST THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENTS ARE. I WOULD APPRECIATE A RECALL BEING ISSUED AND REIMBURSEMENT OF MY $942.63.",
