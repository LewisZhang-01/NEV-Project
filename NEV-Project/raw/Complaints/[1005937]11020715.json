        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC SUCH AS A LEFT TURN OR ON THE FREEWAY AT RUSH HOUR,  MY VEHICLE WILL COMPLETELY CEASE TO ACCELERATE. YOU CAN AUDIBLY HEAR THE CLUTCHES GRINDING INSTEAD OF TICKING AS THEY USED TO AS WELL.  THE DCT SEEMS TO PUT THE CAR IN A NEUTRAL STATE UPON STOP AND GO, AND, NOT MOVE.  THIS INCLUDES WHEN I HAVE BEEN ON THE FREEWAY IN RUSH HOUR AS WELL AS I HAVE BEEN STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION ON A LEFT HAND TURN AND NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACCELERATE FOR AT LEAST 5 SECONDS.  HYUNDAI MOTOR CORP. OF AMERICA STATES THIS IS NORMAL FUNCTIONING FOR THE VEHICLE AND THAT PEOPLE NEED TO LEARN TO USE THE DCT.  I AM SUPPOSED TO APPARENTLY GET OUT OF MY CAR ON THE FREEWAY AND ASK OTHER DRIVERS TO PLEASE HOLD OFF FROM SLAMMING INTO MY BACK END AS THE DCT TAKES 3-5 SECONDS EXTRA TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ACCELERATE IN STOP AND GO SITUATIONS.  I HAVE HAD IT INTO HYUNDAI OF AVONDALE 1X, RODEO HYUNDAI OF SURPRISE 2X, AND, HYUNDAI OF PEORIA 1X FOR THESE ISSUES. I AM VERY AFRAID OF THIS CAR AND HYUNDAI NOW THAT THEY HAVE SEEN THE CAR FOR REPAIRS WILL NO LONGER HONOR THE WARRANTY WORK. THE SERVICE GM OF HYUNDAI PEORIA STATED WHILE ON SPEAKER WITH HYUNDAI AMUSA THAT THEY ARE IN FACT SEEING THIS ISSUE WEEKLY BUT, HYUNDAI DOES NOT HAVE A FIX FOR IT AND THEY DON'T WANT TO BE INVOLVED WITH ANY POSSIBLE ARBITRATION AT THEIR DEALERSHIP!  I ALSO HAD THE VEHICLE INSPECTED AT A SECOND OPINION AWAY FROM HYUNDAI AND HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THIS VEHICLE IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE.  HYUNDAI OF AVONDALE TECH EXPERIENCED WHAT I SAID WAS WRONG WITH THIS DEATH TRAP VEHICLE AND IT SCARED HIM.  THEY ACTUALLY APOLOGIZED FOR HAVING TO GIVE BACK MY CAR AND STOP AND PAYING FOR THE RENTAL.  THE DEALERSHIPS ARE WELL AWARE THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE AND HYUNDAI AMCUSA DOESN'T WANT TO OWN UP TO IT.  WILL IT TAKE SOMEONE DYING LIKE MYSELF BEFORE THIS IS RESOLVED?",
