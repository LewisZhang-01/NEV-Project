I DROVE TO THE TANNING BED WITH NO PROBLEM AND WHEN I CAME OUT AND STARTED MY CAR THE \"SERVICE ALERT\" CAME UP SAYING \"STEERING ASSIST FAULT SERVICE REQUIRED.\" MY CAR HAD BEEN STATIONARY FOR MAYBE 20 MINUTES. I TRIED BACKING OUT OF MY PARKING SPOT AND IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO TURN THE WHEEL. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE HOME- MY ARMS WERE VERY SORE BY THE TIME I PULLED IN THE DRIVEWAY. I CALLED FORD THIS MORNING TO INQUIRE ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND WAS ADVISED IT SOUNDS LIKE A LEAK IN MY STEERING SYSTEM BUT THE CAR IS SAFE TO DRIVE. MY BIGGEST CONCERN, ASIDE FROM HOW MUCH THIS IS GOING TO COST ME, IS THAT THEY SAID IT WAS SAFE TO DRIVE?! IF SOMEONE OR SOMETHING WERE TO PULL OUT IN FRONT OF ME OR I NEEDED TO SWERVE OUT OF THE WAY FOR ANY REASON IT WOULD LITERALLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DO SO.",
