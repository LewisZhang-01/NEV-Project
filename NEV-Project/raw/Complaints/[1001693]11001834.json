TOWED THE UNIT HOME 400 MILES AND DECIDED TO CONTACT LIPPERT, THE MANUFACTURER OF THE AXLES AND BRAKES. I WAS GIVEN A CLAIM NUMBER TO INSPECT THE BRAKES. DUE TO OWNING A TIRE REPAIR SHOP, I WAS ALLOWED TO PERFORM THE INSPECTION MYSELF. WHAT I FOUND WAS NO ISSUE ON THE TWO HUBS AND BRAKES ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE UNIT, BRAKES CONTAMINATED WITH GREASE ON THE TWO RIGHT HAND HUBS. GREASE WAS ON THE MAGNETS, INSIDE OF THE DRUM BRAKING SURFACES AND MAGNET SURFACE. LIPPERT AGREED TO SEND ME 2 NEW BACKING PLATES WITH BRAKES, AND TWO NEW GREASE SEALS, PLUS PAY TWO HOURS OF LABOR. ALL OF THIS IS GREAT, BUT IF I HAD BEEN IN A PANIC STOP SITUATION, I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STOP THIS VEHICLE.",
