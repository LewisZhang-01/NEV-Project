THE DEALERSHIP ADVISED BOTH FRONT TIRES HAVE DEVELOPED SIDEWALL BULGES, AS WELL AS EXCESSIVE TREAD WEAR. (TIRES HAD BEEN ROTATED.)  I WAS ADVISED TO PURCHASE NEW TIRES IMMEDIATELY AS PRESENT ONES WERE EXTREMELY UNSAFE. I READ THAT THIS IS A COMMON COMPLAINT FOR THESE TIRES, SO I CALLED NEXEN DIRECTLY TO SEE IF THEY WOULD OFFER A REPLACEMENT, BUT WAS SHOCKED TO HEAR THEY TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY ON OEM TIRES, NOR DO THEY EVEN OFFER A DISCOUNT ON THE PURCHASE OF NEW TIRES.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, I WON'T BE REPLACING THEM WITH NEW NEXENS WHICH, BY THE WAY, THEIR AGENT TOLD ME THEY DO WARRANT AT NO ADDITIONAL CHANGE.",
