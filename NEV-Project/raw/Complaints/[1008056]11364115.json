        "summary": "1. SPEED CONTROL (MOTION):  CRUISE CONTROL CONTINUALLY SHUTS OFF WHILE TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND HITS ROAD PATCHES/BUMPS.  THIS HAS HAPPENED SINCE I PURCHASED THE CAR NEW;  2. LEATHER ON DASHBOARD (STATIONARY & MOTION):  CAR IS GARAGED IN NY, METICULOUSLY MAINTAINED AND USED OCCASIONALLY, YET THE LEATHER ON THE DASHBOARD WARPED/RIPPLED -- NOT A GOOD LOOK FOR A JAGUAR;  RECENTLY, I SPENT ALMOST $ 1,000 FOR WINDSHIELD HAD TO BE REMOVED/REPLACED TO REPAIR.  NOW LOOKS WORN, THOUGH SIGNS OF WEAR REMAIN;  3. USB & COMMUNICATION COMPONENTS IN MIDDLE DASH DEPT (STATIONARY AND MOTION):  THESE SYSTEMS FAILED FEW WEEKS AFTER WARRANTY EXPIRED.  IN THESE DAYS, VERY IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO USE, BUT JAGUAR DEALER SAID VERY EXPENSIVE TO REPAIR.  4. SUNROOF GASKET (STATIONARY & MOTION):  GASKET STARTED FAILING FEW YEARS AGO, BUT FINALLY REACHED EXTENT REQUIRING REPLACEMENT.  MY PROFESSIONAL UPHOLSTERY REPAIR PROVIDER REPORTED THE REPAIR REQUIRED AN ENTIRE SUNROOF SYSTEM REPLACEMENT ($1,000), WHICH IS VERY NON-SENSIBLE.  THEY INSTALLED INCORRECTLY AND NOW SUNROOF WILL NOT CLOSE WHILE DRIVING, BUT RATHER EMITS LOUD \"FLUTTERING\" SOUND AND SHAKES THE VEHICLE;  5.  WINDOWS (MOTION):  AS YOU ARE AWARE I'M SURE, OPENING PARTIAL REAR WINDOWS INDUCES VIOLENT SHAKING THROUGHOUT VEHICLE.  THIS ISSUE PRESENT IN ORIGINAL DESIGN OF VEHICLE.  6.  RUNNING LIGHTS (MOTION):  THIS VEHICLE WAS DESIGNED WITH NO RUNNING LIGHTS, SO I TRIED TO FIND GARAGE TO INSTALL, FOR SAFETY REASONS. JAGUAR SERVICE REPAIR PROVIDERS AND OTHERS SAID VEHICLE DESIGN PROHIBITS ABILITY TO INSTALL RUNNING LIGHTS.  7. HORN (STATIONARY AND MOTION):  I'M SIMPLY POINTING TO FACT THAT THIS BEAUTIFUL CAR ROARS LIKE A LION, YET HAS WIMPY HORN SOUND!",
