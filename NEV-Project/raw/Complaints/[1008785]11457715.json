        "summary": "Excessive oil usage resulting in the need for a new engine. Car gave no warnings.. no engine light, no oil light, no issues previously starting up. Been looked at by the dealership and quoted $10k for a new engine. With only 150,000 miles, a 2 year old battery, a new water pump and alternator, and full synthetic regular oil changes; I do not believe there should be this significant engine damage to result in an engine replacement. I'm mostly upset that the car ran fine and then suddenly stopped with no warning and now there are such costly consequences that could not have been prevented if there are no signs of issues until it is at a point of no return. There is no oil leakage or any other fluid nor did the engine blow, smoke, or show any signs of failure.",
