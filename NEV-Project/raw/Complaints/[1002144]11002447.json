LUCKILY MY WIFE DID NOT CRASH. SHE WAS DRIVING 60MPH AND LOST POWER STEERING. SHE IS PREGNANT AND HAD 2 KIDS IN CAR. NOW I'VE REPLACED THIS BOLT AGAIN. I PUT PURCHASED A NEW IDLER PULLEY BOLT WITH LOC TITE. I REPLACED IT AND MET EVERY SPECIFICATION THAT NHTSA REQUIRED. BASICALLY IT ONLY REQUIRE MORE TORQUE AND LOC TITE. THIS TIME IT SNAPPED IN MY DRIVE WAY THANK GOODNESS. THIS IS A SERIOUS TRAFFIC SAFETY SITUATION, I'VE READ MULTIPLE FORUMS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE HAD WORK DONE AT DEALERSHIP AND  THE BOLT IS SNAPPING 3 DAYS LATER. OBVIOUSLY BMW DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.",
