THIS IS THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM THAT VOLKSWAGEN HAS ISSUED RECALL 20Z4 FOR TOUAREG MODEL VEHICLES. THE FIRST SYMPTOM I NOTICED WAS THE CAR HAD TO BE CRANKED FOR ONLY A SECOND OR TWO LONGER FOR THE ENGINE TO START. AFTER ABOUT 3 DAYS OF EXPERIENCING A MINOR SHORT CRANK I WAS PARKED IN A PARKING STRUCTURE AND HAD TO CRANK THE ENGINE OVER FOR ALMOST 20 SECONDS BEFORE THE ENGINE STARTED. THIS IS WHEN I BEGAN TO SMELL GASOLINE. I DROVE THE CAR ABOUT 2 MILES HOME AND REMOVED THE REAR SEAT AND FUEL PUMP ACCESS PANEL AND FOUND THE TOP OF THE FUEL TANK COVERED IN FUEL. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER AND THEY CONFIRMED MY DIAGNOSIS OF A \"FUEL FILTER FLANGE\" LEAKING WHICH WAS REPLACED AND RESOLVED THE FUEL LEAK AND PROLONGED CRANK.",
