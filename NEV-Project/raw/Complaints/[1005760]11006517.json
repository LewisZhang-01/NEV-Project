I LIVE ON THE GULF COAST, SO IT REALLY DOESN'T EVEN GET THAT COLD DOWN HERE, BUT I HAVE NOTICED THIS ON MULTIPLE \"COLD\" MORNINGS (TEMPERATURES MAYBE IN THE 40S). I NOTICED SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE HAVE REPORTED THIS PROBLEM. I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE CAR, BUT IT DOES NOT SOUND GOOD.",
