WE WENT TO THE NEAREST FORD DEALERSHIP WHO SAID THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE CAR FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AND IF I WAS COMFORTABLE DRIVING WITHOUT POWER STEERING IT WOULDN'T HURT ANYTHING ELSE. SINCE MY 1ST CAR DIDN'T HAVE POWER STEERING I DECIDED TO GIVE IT A GO. WHEN WE REACHED OUR FINAL DESTINATION WE TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A FORD DEALER AND WAS TOLD IT NEEDED TO HAVE THE RACK AND PINION REPLACED AT A COST OF $2,400. THIS SEEMS TO BE A RECURRING THEME WITH THE FORD FOCUS. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THIS WOULD HAVE OCCURRED WHILE MY SON WAS DRIVING AT 65 MPH ON THE NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE.",
