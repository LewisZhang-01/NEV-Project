STARTING IN JULY OF 2016 I STARTED HAVING ISSUES WITH IT NOT STARTING AND CUTTING OUT.  NOW IT WON'T START AT ALL.  IT IS THE THEFT SYSTEM NOT ALLOWING IT TO START.  I HAVE READ THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINT ABOUT THIS ISSUE OVER MANY DIFFERENT GM VEHICLES.  SOME NEARLY CAUSING WRECKS, STRANDING PEOPLE WITH KIDS , ETC.  WHY HAS THIS ISSUE BEEN LET GO FOR SO LONG.  DOES GM NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS.   I BOUGHT ANOTHER CHEVY RIGHT AFTER I BOUGHT THIS TRUCK.  WE GOT RID OF IT BECAUSE IT WAS DOING THE SAME THING.",
