        "summary": "I've had this bike since Feb 2020.  Very intermittently, when coming to a stop, if I pull the clutch, in preparation for downshifting, the engine cuts out.  It always starts back up though.  this happened on the first day that I had the bike, and still happens at random.  Sometimes it won't happen for weeks.  Sometimes it will happen multiple times on a single ride.  I'm not the only one with this issue.  I've discussed this on online forums, and other owners have the same problem.  Here's a recent video showing 3 stall events in a single ride.  there's a longer video showing most of the ride, then 3 shorter videos showing the stalls  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA8qPt4Dn7CYYfzbvvESGyL8QAm-AHW37  thanks [XXX]  INFORMATION Redacted PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",
