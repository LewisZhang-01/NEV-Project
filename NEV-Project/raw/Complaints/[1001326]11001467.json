I HAD RESEARCHED THIS PROBLEM AND FOUND THERE WAS A RECALL BECAUSE OF THE HEADLAMP DRIVER MODULE FAILING, BUT MY 2008 GMC ENVOY WAS NOT INCLUDED. I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM GMC THE END OF MAY 2017 PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PROTECTION FOR THIS PROBLEM AND IT WAS WORDED \"IF THIS CONDITION \"OCCURS\" ON YOUR 2008 GMC ENVOY WITHIN 12 YEARS OR 150,000 MILES THE CONDITION WOULD BE REPAIRED AT NO CHARGE.\" WHEN I RECEIVED THE MAY 2017 LETTER MY VEHICLE HAD 152,000 MILES ON IT BUT WHEN I FILED THE COMPLAINT IN NOVEMBER 2016 IT HAD 142,000 MILES ON IT.  GMC REFUSED TO REPAIR MY VEHICLE UNDER THE ADDITIONAL PROTECTION BECAUSE OF CURRENT MILEAGE EVEN THOUGH I HAD PROOF THE CONDITION \"OCCURRED\" AT 142,000 MILES.",
