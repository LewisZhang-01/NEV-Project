I TOOK IT TO DEALER, THEY SAID YES IT HAS PROBLEM IN TRANSMISSION AND I HAD TO LEAVE MY VAN TO FIX IT. THEY TOOK 4-5 DAYS, BUT DIDN'T FOUND EXACT CAUSE AND THEY JUST FLUSH TRANSMISSION FLUID.  THEY TOLD ME \"IF YOU FACE SAME PROBLEM AGAIN PLEASE COME BACK WE WILL HELP YOU EVEN WHEN WARRANTY EXPIRE\".  ONE WEEK LATER IT WAS HAVING AGAIN SAME ISSUE AND EVEN MORE THING, IT WAS JERKING WHILE I AM DRIVING ALSO AND REVERSING WAS SAME LIKE BEFORE. I TOOK IT AGAIN TO SAME DEALER, BUT THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING.  NOW MY PROBLEM IS MY WARRANTY IS EXPIRED BUT I  AM HAVING SAME PROBLEMS. THEY COULDN'T FIX IT WHEN I HAD WARRANTY. IT SOUNDS LIKE MY LOSS EVEN I HAD WARRANTY.",
