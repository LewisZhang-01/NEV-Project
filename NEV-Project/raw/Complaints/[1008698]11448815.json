        "summary": "Many times, I've tried to contact someone about this problem, and I've search other blogs in relation to the same problem. My driver's side door will not unlock with remote nor from inside the car. all other doors work fine but the driver's side doesn't unlock unless I use the emergency key to unlock it. At first it was working for a week or so than stopped. And then it would work again then stop. Now, forget about it. Stopped working completely. Many blogs have mentioned a faulty door lock actuator. And that is common, but I've tried to contact the manufacture with email and messages and no response. God forbid if I or my wife has to run into the driver side for any reason and can't because the door won't open like its suppose to.",
