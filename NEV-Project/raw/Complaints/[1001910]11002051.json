ALL WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON AND I WAS UNABLE TO ACCELERATE OR PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE. I HAD TO PULL OVER AND PUT ON MY HAZARDS ON A VERY BUSY FREEWAY. I TOOK MY CAR TO MY LOCAL LEXUS SERVICE CENTER AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT I HAVE AN \"INTERNAL TRANSAXLE SHORT\" AND THE ENTIRE TRANSAXLE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED FOR THE COST OF AROUND $7,000.  LEXUS INFORMED ME THEY ACTUALLY DIDN'T IDENTIFY THE ISSUE OR CAUSE AND SIMPLY CALLED IT A \"GLITCH\". COULD BE CONNECTED TO THE WIRING OR ELECTRICAL SYSTEM, BUT THEIR ANSWER WAS TO JUST COMPLETELY CHANGE OUT THE SYSTEM INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY FIX THE PROBLEM AND AT GREAT COST TO ME. THIS COULD ALSO BE RELATED TO THE ONGOING HYBRID BATTERY ISSUES THAT HAPPEN AROUND 100K MILES, BUT THEY SAID THEY WOULDN'T KNOW UNTIL THIS FIX WAS MADE.",
