ON 08/16/18 THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED BUT THIS TIME IT LASTED UNTIL I MADE IT LATE THAT EVENING. I TOOK IT TO HYUNDAI OF ORANGE PARK 08/17/18  HERE IN JACKSONVILLE AND THE PROBLEM COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED. AS I WAS DRIVING TO WORK 08/22/18 MY CAR STARTED DOING THE SAME THING ONLY THIS TIME YOU COULD FEEL THE VIBRATION OF THE CAR NOT WANTING TO ACCELERATE AND THE CHECK ENGINE WOULD GO OFF AS I'M CHANGING GEARS AND SOON AS I AM DONE SHIFTING IT STAYS ILLUMINATED.I CALLED THE SERVICE CENTER AGAIN AND SHE SAYS TO BRING IT BACK IN FOR TESTING AND THEY CAN ONLY FIX IT IF THEY CAN DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. I AM VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH DRIVING THIS VEHICLE IN TRAFFIC NOT KNOWING IF IT WILL CUTOFF AND I AM HIT.",
