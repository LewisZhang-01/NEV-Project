UPON FAILURE, THE RDC AFFECTS SPEEDOMETER, TACHOMETER, RADIO, BLOWER, WIPERS, IDRIVE SYSTEMS.  DRIVER HAS NO INDICATORS OF TURN SIGNALS OR LIGHTING (EVEN IF FUNCTIONAL) WITHIN THE CABIN OF THE CAR.   THIS OCCURRED IN DRIVING SEQUENCE AS FIRST A SERIES OF FLASHES AND IDRIVE RESTARTS, THEN COMPLETE BLANKING OUT OF ALL DASHBOARD SYSTEMS.  UPON ADVISEMENT OF REPAIR TECH, SIMPLE UNPLUG OF RDC CLEARS ALL DASHBOARD SYMPTOMS EXCEPT TPMS MALFUNCTION INDICATOR.  A CAR SHOULD NOT SIMPLY HAVE A COMPLETE ELECTRONIC MONITORING AND OPERATIONAL (RADIO, BLOWER, TURN INDICATORS, WIPERS) FAILURE DUE TO ONE MONITORING SYSTEM GOING DOWN -- THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW AND COULD HAVE LED TO ME HAVING AN ACCIDENT EASILY DUE TO NO TURN OR SPEED INDICATORS AVAILABLE.",
