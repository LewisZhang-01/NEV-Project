ALL THE FORD DEALERSHIPS AROUND ME (ZIP 95008)  SAY THEY CANNOT DO THE RECALL UNTIL JANUARY 2018.  THIS SEEMS LIKE A SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED MUCH MORE QUICKLY.  FORD SHOULD PROVIDE MORE PARTS IN A TIMELY MANNER AND ALLOW DEALERSHIPS TO DO THE REPAIRS.  I WAS TOLD THAT BY A DEALERSHIP THAT THEY ARE ALLOWED TO ONLY DO SO MANY OF THESE REPAIRS PER WEEK AND THAT IS WHY THEIR APPOINTMENTS ARE SO FAR OUT. I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE DRIVING MYSELF AND MY KIDS AROUND UNTIL JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR IN A CAR WHERE THE SEATBELTS MIGHT NOT WORK.",
