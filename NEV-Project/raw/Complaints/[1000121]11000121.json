I SMELLED SOMETHING BURNING FROM MY VEHICLE AND WHEN I CHECKED THE VEHICLE FOUND THIS LIGHT HAD BURNED THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY.  THIS BURNING OF THE CENTER ASSEMBLY SHORTED OUT MY BRAKE LIGHTS WHICH LEFT ME WITHOUT BRAKES.  THE MECHANIC STATED THAT LOOKING AT THE CENTER ASSEMBLY AS WELL AS THE OTHER BRAKE LIGHT PORTS-THERE WAS A SURGE OF SOME SORT WHICH CAUSED THIS TO HAPPEN.  THE AREAS IN THE BRAKE LIGHT SOCKETS WERE BLACK.  I WAS DRIVING WHEN I SMELLED THE BURNING IN THE CAR AND THUS FAR NO OTHER ELECTRICAL OR LIGHT AREAS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED.  I THOUGHT THIS SHOULD BE REPORTED IN THE EVENT KIA TRUNKS START BURNING.",
