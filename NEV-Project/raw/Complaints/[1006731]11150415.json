        "summary": "MY 20 YEAR OLD SON WAS DRIVING OUR 2010 ON THE STREET WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THE CAR LOST ITS POWER STEERING. HE HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME STEERING THE CAR AND WAS VERY CLOSE TO CRASHING THE VEHICLE. HE WAS IN A HIGH TRAFFIC AREA AT THE TIME OF THEI ISSUE. HE COULD HAVE INJURED HIMSELF OR DIED BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM,  HE WAS ABLE TO, WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY, GET THE CAR OFF OF THE ROAD. HE WAS VERY LUCKY!! THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. THE VEHICLE HAD 2 LIGHTS THAT DISPLAYED: 1. SERVICE POWER STEERING NOW AND 2. SERVICE ADVANCETRAC. IT IS STILL DISPLAYING ON THE DASH AND THERE IS NO POWER STEERING, THEREFORE THE VEHICLE CAN NOT BE DRIVEN.. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE REPAIR!! THIS CAR IS ONLY 8 YEARS OLD AND IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE 2011 MILAN HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND THAT THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THE ISSUE. I HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT THE 2010 HAS THE EXACT SAME SYSTEM (ELECTRIC POWER STEERING) AS THE 2011,  BUT IT WAS NOT RECALLED. HOW CAN THAT BE?? IS IT LESS OF A SAFETY ISSUE BASED ONLY ON THE YEAR? SO IT'S OK FOR 2010 DRIVERS TO BE INJURED BUT NOT THE 2011 OWNERS. I AM A SINGLE MOTHER AND DO NOT KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH PROBLEM. PLEASE LOOK INTO IT ASAP.",
