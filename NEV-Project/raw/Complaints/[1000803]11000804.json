AFTER PEELING THE RUBBER BOOTS THAT COVER THE STANCHIONS, WE NOTICED THAT BOTH STANCHIONS ON THE BIKE HAD SEPARATED. I WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN ABOUT IT, EXCEPT ONE OF THE PERSONS WITH WHOM I WAS RIDING, HAD THE SAME ISSUE HAPPEN WITH HIS 2013 BMW R1200GS. I STILL HAD TO RIDE 170 MILES HOME WITH 15 MILES OF IT ON DIRT. I RODE STRAIGHT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY WOULDN'T LET ME TAKE THE BIKE BECAUSE THEY CONSIDER THIS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. AND, DEALERSHIP KNEW OF THE ISSUE BECAUSE IT HAPPENED TO OTHER CUSTOMERS.  THIS IS DEFECTIVE DESIGN. ONE PERSON BECOMING PERMANENTLY INJURED OR DYING IS ONE TOO MANY. BMW CANNOT PLEAD IGNORANCE. BMW REPLACED THE STANCHIONS ON UNDER WARRANTY AND I COLLECTED THE REPAIRED BIKE ON JUNE 6TH. THE FOLLOWING WEEKEND, JUNE ON 11, AFTER LESS THAN 300 MILES OF RIDING, BOTH STANCHIONS SEPARATED, AGAIN. BMW ROADSIDE SERVICE TOWED BIKE TO THE SHOP FOR REPAIR. THIS IS DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT REQUIRES A RECALL.",
