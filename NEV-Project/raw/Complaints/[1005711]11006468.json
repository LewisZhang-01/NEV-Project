THE CAR DROVE SMOOTH EVEN THOUGH IT HAD 127,000 MILES. THE ONLY THING WE DIDN'T CHECK WAS THE DRIVER FRONT SEAT. WHEN I TRIED ADJUSTING MY SEAT UPWARD THE SEAT BEGINS TO LEAN SIDE WAYS  TOWARDS THE MIDDLE CONSOLE TO THE POINT ITS RUBBING ON IT. I TOOK IT TO THE GM DEALER THEY LOOK AT IT AND TOLD ME THAT THE MAIN METAL BAR FRAME IS BROKEN. THAT I NEEDED A NEW REPLACEMENT SEAT. THEY QUOTED ME $1000. I CONTACTED PONTIAC AND THEY REFUSE TO ADDRESS IT. BECAUSE OF THE MILEAGE ON THE VEHICLE. PLEASE HELP ME. I CAN'T AFFORD THE $1000 FOR A NEW SEAT.",
