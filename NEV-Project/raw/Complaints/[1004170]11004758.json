I HAVE A 2008 CTS AND NEVER HAD A SUSPENSION ISSUE AND THAT CAR HAVE OVER 160,000 MILES.  THIS SEEMS LIKE A DEFECT BECAUSE I WAS READING ALL THE COMPLAINTS.  I BROUGHT THE CAR IN MAY 2016 AND IT IS GETTING WORSE.  I CAN'T BE A SPECIFIC DATE BUT THE PROBLEM IS ONGOING.  I DON'T THINK THE CONSUMER HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET TO GET THIS FIX.",
