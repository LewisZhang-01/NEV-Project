GRABBED FIRE EXTINGUISHER BUT IT NEVER FLAMED UP.  IN THE PROCESS, IT BURNED MY BATTERY UP ALSO.  JEEP HAD A RECALL ON THE 160 AMP ALTERNATOR FOR THE SAME ISSUE BUT SAID MINE WAS NOT COVERED BECAUSE IT WAS 180 AMP.  I HAVE READ WHERE SEVERAL OTHERS HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE 180 AMP ALTERNATOR.  HAD THE CAR TOWED TO FORMER DEALER I BOUGHT IT FROM(HE WAS THE NEW CAR DEALER AT THE TIME), HE SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN A BATTERY THAT HOT AFTER SITTING FOR AWHILE AND COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT DIDN'T BURN UP.  COST OF REPAIR WAS OVER $1000 FOR A NEW ALTERNATOR AND BATTERY",
