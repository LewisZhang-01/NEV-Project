DESPITE REPLACING THE CLUTCH SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR, THE VEHICLE STILL AT TIMES STUTTERS ROUGH ENOUGH TO SPILL A CUP OF HOT COFFEE UNEXPECTEDLY, AND WILL RANDOMLY DELAY ACCELERATING. FOR EXAMPLE,  I DON'T FEEL SAFE QUICKLY TAKING LEFT HAND TURNS ACROSS ONCOMING TRAFFIC OUT OF FEAR THAT THE CAR WILL NOT RESPOND AS FAST AS I'VE HIT THE GAS. THE STUTTER AND DELAY IS WORST WHEN GOING FROM A STATIONARY POSITION TO MOVING, THOUGH IT ABSOLUTELY HAPPENS WHEN AT HIGH SPEEDS AS WELL (45+). THE CAR IS SO UNPREDICTABLE WHEN HITTING THE GAS THAT IT'S HARD TO FEEL SAFE WHILE DRIVING IT. TURN THE AIR CONDITIONING ON IN THE VEHICLE AND THE TRANSMISSION BECOMES EVEN LESS PREDICTABLE AND WILL DELAY RESPONDING WHEN THE GAS IS PRESSED EVEN AT HIGH SPEEDS (45MPH +).",
