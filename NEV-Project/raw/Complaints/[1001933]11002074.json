IT SEEMS TO HAPPEN IN CYCLES LIKE EVERY MONTH OR SO BUT WHEN THE CAR IS TURNED OFF AND THEN ON AGAIN THE PROBLEM DISAPPEARS, UNTIL THE NEXT TIME. THIS IS A DEFINITE MANUFACTURING MALFUNCTION AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE BLOGGED ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE. MANY HAVE CLAIMED IT'S AN ABS OR BOOSTER BRAKE ISSUE BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL. A RECALL IS NECESSARY BEFORE A MAJOR TRAGEDY OCCURS.",
