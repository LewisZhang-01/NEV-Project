HOW MANY OTHER BUYERS WERE MISLED BY THE WINDOW STICKER AND SOLD A CAR WITH MORE EXTENSIVE SAFETY EQUIPMENT THAN WHAT THEY ACTUALLY RECEIVED?  SHOULD HYUNDAI RECALL THE VEHICLE TO INSTALL THE DEVICES AS ADVERTISED AND SOLD OR REIMBURSE THE BUYERS FOR THE DIFFERENCE AND THE LESSER VALUE CAR SOLD?  MY CAR WAS STATIONARY AND NO MALFUNCTION KNOWN YET, BUT LACK OF ASSIST FUNCTION MAKES THE CAR LESS SAFE THAN REPRESENTED WHEN SOLD TO ME.  THE DEFICIENCY, ERROR NOTICE LETTER IS NOT DATED AND DOES NOT OFFER TO CORRECT THE MISREPRESENTATION OR REFUND THE COST OF INSTALLING THIS SYSTEM, AND DOES NOT OFFER TO INSTALL IT AFTER THEIR ERROR.",
