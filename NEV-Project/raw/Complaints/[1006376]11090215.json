I BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING IS EXTREMELY RELEVANT.  ** THIS COMMENT ON THE TESLAMOTORSCLUB RAISES A VERY GOOD POINT.  MARK_T, 7 MINUTES AGO I STILL THINK THIS ALL COMES DOWN TO HOW MUCH MUSCLE MEMORY YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH...  IF YOU'VE BEEN DRIVING ICE AUTOS FOR YEARS THEN YOU DO ALL YOUR LOW SPEED MANOEUVRES WITH YOUR FOOT FEATHERING THE BRAKE AND YOUR 'SAFETY' REACTION IS TO PRESS HARD ON THE BREAK PEDAL.  WE ALL KNOW HOW THAT ENDS IF YOU FORGET YOU HAVE CREEP OFF AND YOU ARE IN AN EV WITH YOUR FOOT ON THE 'GO' PEDAL... :)  SAME GOES FOR ANY UNEXPECTED OBSTACLE CAUSING A SUDDEN STOP, INERTIA IS LIKELY TO INCREASE PEDAL PRESSURE...  ENTIRELY SAFE IF YOUR FOOT IS ON THE BRAKE, BUT NOT IF YOUR FOOT IS ON THE 'GAS'...  LUCKYJ, 2 MINUTES AGO  YEAH, I'M WITH YOU ON THIS. I'VE DRIVEN A MANUAL ALL MY LIFE UNTIL I GOT A TESLA. SOMETIMES I WISH THE SIGNIFICANT BRAKING THAT CAN COME FROM REGEN WOULD BE RESTRICTED TO WHEN I ACTUALLY PRESS THE BRAKE. I THINK THE \"ONE PEDAL\" CONCEPT IS NOT GOOD FOR MOST FOLKS. MAYBE EVEN NOT GOOD FOR ANYONE.***    PLEASE CONSIDER THIS.  CONCERNED CITIZEN.",
