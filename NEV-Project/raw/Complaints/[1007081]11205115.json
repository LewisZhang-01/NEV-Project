HE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING OBVIOUS AND PRECEDED TO DRIVE HOME. AS HE PULLED OUT ONTO THE CITY STREET THE KIA STALLED. WE THEN HAD TO CALL A TOW TRUCK, GET IT TOWED TO THE KIA IN AMARILLO, TX. THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THE ENGINE HAD LOCKED AND IT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. THEY ALSO SAID THAT OUR KIA WAS NOT COVERED BY THE RECALL! EVEN THOUGH IT IS STALLING JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER MODELS INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.",
