        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY AT ABOUT 55 MPH AND A DEER RAN IN FRONT OF MY CAR. I HIT THE BRAKES HARD BUT COULDN'T STOP IN TIME (THE DEER DIED) AND WHEN I DID FINALLY DID ACHIEVE A STOP I NOTICED MY BRAKES WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR. THEY WERE VERY SPONGY AND TOOK A HUGE DISTANCE TO STOP THE CAR THE REST OF THE DRIVE HOME, EVEN AT SPEEDS UNDER 35 MPH. I THOUGHT MAYBE THE COLLISION CAUSED DAMAGE TO MY BRAKES SOMEHOW. A MECHANIC BLED MY BRAKES AND RESTORED FUNCTIONALITY, AND CAREFULLY INSPECTED EVERYTHING BUT COULD NOT FIND ANY DAMAGE. A FEW WEEKS LATER IT SNOWED AND WHEN MY CAR SLID ON SOME ICE WHILE BRAKING INTO A TURN, THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR AGAIN. I HAD THE BRAKES BLED AGAIN AND THE VEHICLE THOROUGHLY INSPECTED BUT AGAIN THEY FOUND NOTHING. THEY RECOMMENDED REPLACING THE MASTER CYLINDER. BEFORE I COULD GET THAT WORK DONE, ANOTHER SNOW CAUSED SLIPPERY ROADS WHICH AGAIN CAUSED MY BRAKES TO GO SPONGY WHEN BRAKING ON A PATCH OF ICE. MY MECHANIC RECOMMENDED I CONTACT NISSAN AND DURING MY RESEARCH I FOUND HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS FOR 2009 NISSAN MURANOS WITH SIMILAR CONDITIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO REPLACE THE ABS HCU (AVERAGE COST, $2500). TWO DIFFERENT NISSAN DEALERS AND THEIR CORPORATE REPS SAY THEY KNOW NOTHING OF THE PENDING NHTSA INVESTIGATION ON THIS PROBLEM.",
