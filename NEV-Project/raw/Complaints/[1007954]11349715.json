WE HAD A COMPANY JUMP START US, DROVE AROUND FOR AN HOUR AND THEN WENT HOME. WE PARKED IT AT HOME SUNDAY AFTERNOON WHERE IT STAYED UNTIL 2 DAYS LATER.  8/04/2020 TUESDAY MORNING AT 8AM I WENT TO START IT TO TAKE MY CAT TO THE VET AND IT WOULD NOT START. WE HAD TO USE A A RIDE SERVICE BECAUSE OF TIME CONSTRAINTS.  8/5/2020 WEDNESDAY WE HAD THE SAME COMPANY COME BACK OUT AND JUMP START  US AGAIN. WE DROVE STRAIGHT TO THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE. WE REFUSED TO LEAVE WITH THE CAR UNTIL THEY DID SOMETHING. THEY FOUND A PARASITIC DRAW REPLACED THE BATTERY. I DOUBT THE UNDERLINING ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED.  THEY REPLACED A BRAND NEW BATTERY AT JUST 4,155 MILES ON A BRAND NEW 2020 SUBARU OUTBACK.",
