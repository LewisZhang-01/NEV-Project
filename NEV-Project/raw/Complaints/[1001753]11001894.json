THIS MEANS THAT MY PASSENGER AIRBAGS AND PERHAPS ALL OF MY AIRBAGS WOULD NOT FUNCTION IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH. AFTER TAKING MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP, THEY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS A SENSOR ISSUE AND SUGGESTED THAT I PAY $2,000 TO REPLACE THE SENSOR BENEATH THE PASSENGER SEAT (A REPAIR THAT WOULD NOT HAVE RESOLVED THE UNDERLYING ISSUE ACCORDING TO THE MECHANICS WHO LATER EXAMINED MY VEHICLE). AFTER READING ABOUT THE LR2 RECALL RELATED TO THE AIRBAG LIGHT, I ASKED IF MY VEHICLE WAS INCLUDED AND THE DEALERSHIP SAID NO. I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO ANOTHER SHOP TO GET A SECOND OPINION. I JUST MENTIONED THE LIGHT AND NOT ANYTHING RELATED TO THE RECALL BEFORE THEY LOOKED AT IT. AFTER EXTENSIVE TESTING, THEY FOUND THAT THE DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODE, UO154-00, APPEARED AND TOLD ME THAT THE DEALERSHIP SHOULD RESOLVE THE ISSUE FREE OF CHARGE SINCE IT IS THE EXACT PROBLEM ENCOMPASSED BY THE RECALL (CAMPAIGN #14V395000). I AM FAIRLY CERTAIN THAT MY VEN # IS OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF THE RECALL SO I AM UNSURE OF HOW TO PROCEED.",
