IT FRIGHTENED ME AND CAUSED ME TO SWERVE INTO THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC LANE, FORTUNATELY NO CARS WERE AROUND ME AT THE TIME AND I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER AND REGAIN MY COMPOSURE. I SHIVER WHEN I THINK OF HOW BADLY THIS MIGHT HAVE GONE IF OPPOSING TRAFFIC WAS THERE AT THE TIME! A DAY LATER MY LEFT ARM STILL HURTS FROM DEPLOYMENT. MY GRANDDAUGHTER WAS IN THE CAR WITH ME AT THE TIME OF INCIDENT.",
