BRAKE ROTOR IS NOT OVERLY HOT, NOR IS THE HUB, WHICH WOULD POSS INDICATE HANGING CALIPER OR SEIZING BEARING. NOISE CONTINUES WITH CLUTCH ENGAGED AND ENGINE AT IDLE. IT CAN BE HEARD OVER EXHAUST WHILE ON THROTTLE. LESS THAN 3000 MILES, BOUGHT BRAND NEW, BUT AFRAID TO RIDE DUE TO NOISE.  I HAVE OVER 45 YRS EXPERIENCE IN RIDING, RACING, ETC.  BEEN TO DEALER TWICE FOR ISSUE, TOLD \"NO PROBLEMS FOUND.\"  DEALERSHIP HAS NOW CHANGED HANDS AND BIKE IS OBVIOUSLY TIMED OUT ON WARRANTY. HAS BEEN DOING THIS SINCE ABOUT 250 MILES, SINCE 2008. MULTIPLE DEPLOYMENTS IMPEDED TIMELY REPORTING OF ISSUE.",
