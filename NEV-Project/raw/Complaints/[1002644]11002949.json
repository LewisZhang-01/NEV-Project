WHEN CONTROLS ARE ACTING UP, NOT ONLY DOES THE PANEL NOT DISPLAY PROPERLY, BUT ALSO FAILS TO RESPOND TO ANY ADJUSTMENTS. NOT BEING ABLE TO ADJUST THE AUDIO OR CLIMATE CONTROL IS AN INCONVENIENCE. HOWEVER, NOT BEING ABLE TO DEFROST FRONT OR REAR WINDOWS WHEN NEEDED IS A SAFETY HAZARD. PROBLEM HAS BEEN REPORTED ON SUBARU FORUMS (FOR EXAMPLE, HTTP://WWW.SUBARUOUTBACK.ORG/FORUMS/80-ELECTRICAL-ELECTRONICS/23909-08-O-B-RADIO-HVAC-CONTROL-LIGHTING-PROB.HTML).  PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED BOTH WHILE DRIVING AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER IGNITION. GOES AWAY SOMETIMES ON ITS OWN, SOMETIMES WHEN TURN OFF CAR AND TURN BACK ON, SOMETIMES DOESN'T RESOLVE EVEN WITH RE-IGNITION. HAPPENS ON CITY STREETS AND ON HIGHWAYS BUT I SPEND MORE TIME ON CITY STREETS.",
