I PULLED OVER AS QUICKLY AND SAFELY AND SHUT OFF CAR.  CAR WOULD NO LONGER START. MY CHILDREN WERE PANICKING AS THIS IS OUR MAIN SOURCE OF TRANSPORTATION AND WE COULD BARELY GET OFF THE ROAD SINCE WE HAD ZERO NOTICE OR WARNING OF ANYTHING HAPPENING  AND ACCORDING TO THE GAUGE, I HAD PLENTY OF FUEL. WE HAD TO BE TOWED HOME AFTER WAITING FOR 3 HOURS FOR A TOW TRUCK. AFTER MANY SEARCHES OF WHAT COULD BE, I SAW FAULTY GAS GAUGES ARE A COMMON ISSUE. SO I ADDED A COUPLE GALLONS OF GAS AND MY CAR FIRED RIGHT UP.",
