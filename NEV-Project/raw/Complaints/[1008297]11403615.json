BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED MOBILITY OF THE MIRROR, I AM UNABLE TO SEE OTHER CARS BEHIND MY VEHICLE WITHOUT LOWERING MY HEAD AND RECLINING MY SEAT BACKWARDS, BOTH OF WHICH CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS TO DO WHILE DRIVING. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE MIRROR ADJUSTED TO BE LONGER, OR ABLE TO BE ADJUSTED FURTHER UPWARD TO IMPROVE VISIBILITY FOR TALLER PEOPLE, LIKE MYSELF.",
