        "summary": "I HAVE A 2012 CHEVY EQUINOX THAT I HAVE OWNED SINCE AUG. 2015.  THE CAR USES EXCESSIVE OIL, TWO OR MORE QUARTS BETWEEN OIL CHANGES ON MY FOUR CYLINDER ENGINE.  A WEB SEARCH FOUND THIS TO BE A VERY COMMON PROBLEM. CHEVY CAME UP WITH THE IDEA THAT THIS WAS A NORMAL CONDITION, BUT ANY BACK YARD MECHANIC KNOWS DIFFERENT.  AFTER ALL THE COMPLAINTS CHEVY FINALLY ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN ON EXCESSIVE OIL USE. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP WHO SAID I NEEDED AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST WHICH OF COURSE IS NOT REIMBURSED.  I PURCHASE INSURANCE TOTAL LOST VEHICLES AND REPAIR THEM.  I HAVE BEEN DRIVER THIS CAR FOR 2  YEAR. CAR HAS 60000 MILES.  CHEVY STILL HAS CAR LISTED AS SALVAGE WITH WARRANTY VOID IN THEIR COMPUTER.  NO DEALERSHIP WILL TOUCH IT. I AM ON MY  4TH CALL TO CHEVY AND THEY DO NOT RESPOND.  CAR WILL GO LOW ON OIL TO THE POINT THE ENGINE BANGS WITH NO LOW OIL INDICATION.  TSB ISSUE WILL NOT DO REPAIR.",
