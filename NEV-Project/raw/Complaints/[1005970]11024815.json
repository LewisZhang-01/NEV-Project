VEHICLE OWNER IS VERY CONCERNED FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY, ESPECIALLY RISK OF FIRE OR EXPLOSION WHEN VEHICLE IS PARKED IN AN ENCLOSED SPACE SUCH AS A HOME GARAGE.    VEHICLE IS JUST OVER 125,000 MILES.  HONDA DEALERSHIP REFUSED TO INQUIRE ON BEHALF OF VEHICLE OWNER WHETHER HONDA CORPORATE WILL COVER REPAIRS AS PART OF ANY WARRANTY OR RECALL, UNLESS VEHICLE OWNER FIRST PAYS FOR A DIAGNOSTIC.  HONDA DEALERSHIP COULD NOT GIVE EVEN A ROUGH ESTIMATE OF REPAIRS BASED ON VEHICLE OWNER'S DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM.  HONDA DEALERSHIP DID NOT PROVIDE ANY ALTERNATE MEANS FOR CUSTOMER TO CONTACT HONDA CORPORATE WITH THIS PROBLEM WITHOUT FIRST PAYING HONDA DEALERSHIP FOR A DIAGNOSTIC.      PREVIOUS NEWS ARTICLES REPORT HONDA'S KNOWLEDGE AND ISSUANCE OF AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THIS PROBLEM GOING BACK TO 2011, BUT THE WARRANTY WAS REPORTEDLY LIMITED TO 10 YEARS AND 120,000 MILES.  VEHICLE OWNER WAS NEVER NOTIFIED OF THIS VIA MAIL OR DURING ANY SERVICE VISITS TO VARIOUS HONDA DEALERSHIPS.  IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL AND OWNERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED.",
