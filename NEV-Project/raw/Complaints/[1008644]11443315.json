        "summary": "At the beginning of the year my car started going into limp mode and shutting down. I had it inspected and the purge valve was faulty and I paid to have it replaced in august 2021. In the past month it\u2019s started dying while driving, mostly as I\u2019m pulling up to a stoplight. The engine will sputter and it will completely die while the car is in drive which means I loose controll of the steering wheel even while it\u2019s still moving. I just had it inspected and it\u2019s the same issue, the purge valve I\u2019ve just replaced is stuck closed. So this will be the 3rd purge valve this car has had in a 4 month period. I\u2019m afraid this is going to cause me to have an accident and it\u2019s the same thing over and over so it sounds like it\u2019s a faulty part.",
