        "summary": "THIS CAR HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS. I HAVE APPROACHED MAZDA WITH NUMEROUS SERVICE COMPLAINTS AND THEY REFUSE TO FIX. THE CAR GETS TERRIBLE GAS MILEAGE NOT THE FACTORY STATED 42 MPG WHICH WAS SOLD ON THE MSRP BUT MORE LIKE 22. THE SUSPENSION DRIVES TERRIBLE MAKES NOISES, THE CAR \"CREAKS\" WHEN GOING OVER THINGS AND IS NOT STABLE AT FREEWAY SPEEDS. THE CAR ALSO SWAYS FORM LEFT TO RIGHT ON THE FREEWAY AND IS EXTREMELY SLOW TO STOP. IT IS DANGEROUS AND MAZDA WILL NOT FIX. I EVEN HAVE A VOICEMAIL FORM MAZDA CORPORATE STATING THEN REFUSE TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS. I HAVE HAD TO HIRED A LAWYER TO DECLARE THE CAR A LEMON. MAZDA ALSO REFUSED TO SERVICE THE CAR FOR OIL CHANGES, TIRE ROTATION, ETC. I HAVE ALSO FILED A CLAIM WITH MAZDA CORPORATE ALONG WITH THE NUMEROUS TIMES IN AND OUT OF THE SHOP YET THEY STILL REFUSE AND ARE UNWILLING TO SERVICE/FIX THE SAFETY ISSUES ON MY CAR. ALSO, THE HEATED SEATS, BOTH FRONT AND PASSENGER, HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BE FIXED SINCE THE DAY I PURCHASED THE CAR (I HAVE NOW HAD THE CAR APPROX 14 MONTHS). AS OF TODAY 7/11/2017, THIS PROBLEM THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR EARLY 2016 HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED. PLEASE HELP!",
