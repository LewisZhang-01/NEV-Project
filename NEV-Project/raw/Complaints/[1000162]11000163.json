I SAW A REPORT ON PBS NEWS HOUR ABOUT TRUCKING COMPANIES GETTING AROUND TRUCK SAFETY REGULATIONS BY SUBCONTRACTING AND 'LEASING' THEIR TRUCKS TO FORMER EMPLOYEES, NOW INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. OFTEN, THE TRUCK DRIVERS ARE IMMIGRANTS WHO MAY NOT READ OR EVEN SPEAK ENGLISH FLUENTLY AND DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE GETTING INTO. THEY ARE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF AND REQUIRED TO WORK 16+ HOURS PER DAY. THEIR TRUCKS OFTEN DO NOT MEET THE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS THAT TRUCK COMPANY TRUCKS ARE EXPECTED TO ADHERE TO. SOME UNSCRUPULOUS OWNERS OF TRUCKING COMPANIES HAVE RESORTED TO THIS AS A WAY TO MAXIMIZE. PROFITS AND SKIRT SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. I URGE YOU TO INVESTIGATE THESE ABUSES, AS IT PUTS THE PUBLIC AND TRUCK DRIVERS AT GRAVE RISK.
