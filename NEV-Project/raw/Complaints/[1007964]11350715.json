I DEPRESS THE GAS TO BRING IT BACK UP TO SPEED AND THE CAR WILL JERK AND SHAKE BEFORE I AM ABLE TO GAIN A SAFE SPEED AGAIN. THERE IS TIMES WHEN I HAVE TO PULL OVER, REST FOR A FEW MINUTES AND RESTART MY CAR TO GET TO MY DESTINATION. I HAD TO TAKE MY CAR INTO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP SERVICE, MY CVT TRANSMISSION IS FAILING AND COULD STOP AT ANY MOMENT, I NEED TO REPLACE IT FOR $4,400. NISSAN IS NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEFECTIVE CVT, THE CAR IS 4 YEARS OLD. I BOUGHT IT AS MY MOST RELIABLE VEHICLE.",
