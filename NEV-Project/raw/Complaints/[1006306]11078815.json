THE WHEEL STUD STRETCHED 0.044\" BEFORE I STOPPED TRYING TO TORQUE IT UP TO SPECIFICATION.  THE WHEEL STUD AND NUT WERE REPLACED. THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY. THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT OR INCIDENT INVOLVED. I BELIEVE THAT EITHER FORD HAS OVERSTATED THE TIGHTENING TORQUE OR THERE IS A MATERIALS AND/OR HEAT TREATING DEFECT. THE WHEEL STUD APPEARS TO BE ZINC PLATED.  THE WHEEL BOLT TORQUE OF 150 FT-LBS IS LISTED IN REFERENCE MATERIALS AS THE TIGHTENING TORQUE FOR PLAIN, UNLUBRICATED M14 CLASS 10.9 STEEL FASTENERS.  THE TIGHTENING TORQUE FOR ZINC PLATED M14 FASTENERS IS ABOUT 20 FT-LB LESS.",
