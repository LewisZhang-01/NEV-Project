DIDN'T THINK OF IT AS A BIG ISSUE UNTIL I READ THE HAZARDS OF RUSTING FRAME ON THE ENGINE COULD DROP THE ENGINE WHILE DRIVING. NOW NOT DRIVING IT. IT HAD A TIRE ROD REPAIRED LAST YEAR AND STILL WENT OUT THIS YEAR. IT MIGHT BE DUE TO CORROSION. A LOT OF ELECTRONIC PROBLEMS TOO. FELT LIKE WASTED MY MONEY EVERY YEAR KEEPING THIS VEHICLE IN SHAPE. THIS STATE ALSO LIKES SELLING THESE TYPES OF VEHICLE SO THEY CAN JUICE FOLKS MONEY EVERY YEAR FOR INSPECTIONS AND REPAIR. THEY PUT SALT ON THE GROUND EVERY WINTER THAT EATS UP THE FRAMES OF THE VEHICLE.",
