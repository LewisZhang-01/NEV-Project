I COULDN'T GO FASTER THAN 20 MPH.  I TOOK MY CAR TO THE SHOP AND WAS TOLD I NEEDED A NEW TRANSMISSION.  THE CODE THEY READ WAS PO846.  MY CAR ONLY HAS 105K MILES!!!  I HAVE READ MANY OTHER COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SAME ISSUE FROM MANY PEOPLE.  I ALSO READ THE MANUFACTURER EXTENDED THE WARRANTY BUT ONLY UNTIL 2010!!!  WHY????   THESE CARS ARE HAZARDOUS TO BE ON THE ROAD AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A LAWSUIT FILED!!  THIS HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER I WAS TOLD TO REPLACE THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER, WHICH WAS DONE ON 8/25/17",
