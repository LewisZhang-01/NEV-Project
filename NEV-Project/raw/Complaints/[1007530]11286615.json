IT HAPPENED YESTERDAY WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND SHOOK SO SEVERELY I HAD TO SLOW TO 30 MPH BEFORE IT STOPPED. THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS LIFE THREATENING MATTER THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. TRUCK HAS 9000 MILES ON IT AND THAT'S IT. BEEN DOING IT SINCE NEW, BUT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME IT WAS THIS SEVERE. IT ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT. EVERYTHING IS STOCK ON THIS 6.2 LITER F-250 SUPER CAB 4WHEEL DRIVE.  AN INEXPERIENCED DRIVER COULD EASILY HAVE HAD A FATAL ACCIDENT IF THEY DIDN'T HANDLE THE SITUATION CORRECTLY OR IF I WAS ON A TURN.",
