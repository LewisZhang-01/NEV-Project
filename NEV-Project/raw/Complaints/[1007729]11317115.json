THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN REPORTED BEFORE BY ME AND MANY OTHERS AND YET NO ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN BY NHTSA OR GM FOR A REMEDY. I'M SKEPTICAL ABOUT WHETHER IT'S WORTH TAKING THE TIME TO MAKE SUCH REPORTS TO NHTSA WHEN YOUR RESPONSE SOUNDS MORE LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN BY GM CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS RATHER THAN THE PUBLIC SAFETY ADVOCATE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE.     YOU CLAIM THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DATA TO TAKE ACTION. MODEL YEARS AFFECTED ARE FROM 2007 THROUGH 2014  ON NUMEROUS GM NAMEPLATES IE: AVALANCHE, SILVERADO, TAHOE, SUBURBAN, YUKON (XL), SIERRA AND ESCALADE. ERRING ON THE SIDE OF SAFETY SHOULD, AT LEAST, PROMPT AN INVESTIGATION FROM THE DATA ALREADY RECEIVED. IT SHOULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED THAT THIS DESIGN AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION OCCURRED WHEN GM WAS BEING BAILED OUT BY TAX PAYERS AND QUITE A FEW OF THEM ARE NOW LEFT HOLDING THE BAG WHILE THEY ARE POTENTIALLY AT RISK..",
