LOOKING AT IT I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM. I HAVE 2 YOUNG KIDS AND THEY COULD HAVE BEEN BADLY HURT IF I WASN'T ABLE TO MAN HANDLE THE TRUCK. DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO. NOT SURE WHAT IS CAUSING IT. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO TO LOOK INTO THIS CAUSE NOW I'M SCARED TO DRIVE MY TRUCK. ESPECIALLY WITH MY KIDS IN IT. I'M NOT SURE WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT THIS BUT I WOULD REALLY HATE TO SEE SOMETHING BAD HAPPEN TO A FAMILY FOR A ISSUE LIKE THIS. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I HOPE TO HEAR A RESPONSE BACK FROM YOU ABOUT THIS ISSUE.",
