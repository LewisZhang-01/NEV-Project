        "summary": "A FEW YEARS AGO THERE WAS A RECALL OF FORD 2013 FUSION DUE TO DOOR LATCHES FAILING.  MY LOCAL DEALER TOLD ME THAT THEY PERFORMED THE WARRANTY REPAIRS.  A FEW MONTHS AGO THE RIGHT REAR DOOR ON MY CAR WOULD NOT STAY CLOSED.  I CONTACTED THE DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT SINCE THE REPAIR HAD BEEN MADE THERE WAS NO WARRANTY COVERAGE.  I DISSEMBLED THE DOOR MYSELF AND LOCATED THE DEFECTIVE PART.  WHILE RESEARCHING THE PART I DISCOVERED NHTSA RECALL 20V-177.  THE YEAR OF MY CAR WAS NOT LISTED IN THE RECALL BUT THE PART NUMBER OF THE DEFECTIVE PART WAS.  I HAVE ATTACHED THE RECALL INFORMATION AS WELL AS A PHOTO OF THE DEFECTIVE PART FROM MY VEHICLE. THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE SCENARIOS.  THE DEFECTIVE PART WAS ACTUALLY NEVER REPLACE BY THE DEALER, OR, THE PART USED TO REPLACE THE ORIGINAL DEFECTIVE PART IS DEFECTIVE AS WELL. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.",
