AFTER SPEAKING WITH THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT AND REALIZING THAT THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS WITH MY VEHICLE, I DID SOME RESEARCH AND SEE THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL OF CAR AND IS A VERY COSTLY REPAIR.  I CAN'T GET MY VEHICLE INTO THE LR DEALER FOR MORE THAN 2 WEEKS - HOWEVER I AM WONDERING WHY, AFTER REVIEWING ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL IN THIS MAKE/MODEL OF VEHICLE THERE HAS NOT BEEN A RECALL ON IT.  I HAVE CONTACTED LR NA BUT DO NOT EXPECT REMEDIATION.  I AM HOPING THE NHTSA WILL LOOK AT YET ANOTHER COMPLAINT AND PROVIDE CONSUMERS SOME ASSISTANCE IN THIS MATTER.",
