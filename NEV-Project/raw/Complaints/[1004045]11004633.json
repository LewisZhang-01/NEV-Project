THE INLET FLAPPER ON THE FUEL TANK IS DEFECTIVE ALLOWING FUEL TO OVERFLOW THE CHARCOAL CANISTER. THIS IS THE SAME PROBLEM AS THE 2005-2006 MODELS THAT NOW COME WITH A LIFETIME WARRANTY ON FUEL TANKS. I CALLED CHRYSLER AND THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO WORK WITH ME TO REPLACE IT OR CONSUME SOME OF THE COSTS, AND IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE. IT HAS DIES OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION OVER 10 TIMES AND WONT ALWAYS RE-START. SOMETIMES IT TAKES 5-10 MINUTES, AND OTHER TIMES IT STARTS RIGHT BACK UP. I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A TURN AND THE CAR STALLED OUT AND I ALMOST HIT THE VEHICLE TO THE RIGHT OF ME. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS AND NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE LIFETIME WARRANTY ISSUED TO 2005/2006 MODELS.",
