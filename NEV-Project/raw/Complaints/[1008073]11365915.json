THE STEERING WHEEL IS NOT ONLY MORE DIFFICULT TO TURN NOW, BUT IT DOES NOT TURN SMOOTHLY OR CONSISTENTLY.  AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS THIS COULD EASILY RESULT IN AN OVERTURN AND SERIOUS VEHICLE ACCIDENT.  THIS IS AN ELECTRIC POWER STEERING UNIT (NOT HYDRAULIC) SO THERE IS NO WAY TO MAINTAIN THE SYSTEM.  THE REPAIR IS ABOUT $1900 AND REQUIRES A COMPLETE REPLACEMENT OF THE POWER STEERING UNIT, RACK AND PINION.  SUBARU HAS NOT BEEN HELPFUL AS I'VE DISCUSSED THE SAFETY CONCERN WITH THEM.",
