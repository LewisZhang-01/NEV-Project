FIRST I PERFORMED A \"LAUNCH MODE\" LAUNCH WHERE MAX BATTERY WAS ON AND THEN INITIATED THE SEQUENCE WITH HOLD BRAKE, HOLD ACCELERATOR, RELEASE BRAKE.  THIS SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED THE CAR.  THEN PERFORMED A REGULAR LAUNCH (WITHOUT \"LAUNCH MODE\") IN WHICH I STOMP THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL LIKE I'VE DONE NUMEROUS TIMES BEFORE.  ON THIS OCCASION THE ACCELERATOR PEDAL BROKE OFF AND THE CAR CAME TO A QUICK STOP VIA REGENERATIVE BRAKING AS I PULLED OVER ONTO THE SHOULDER.  LUCKILY THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC ON THIS ROAD; IF THIS HAD HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY OR ON A BUSY ROAD IT COULD HAVE BEEN DANGEROUS AS I HAD NO REAL WAY TO ACCELERATE TO GET TO THE SHOULDER OR AVOID TRAFFIC.",
