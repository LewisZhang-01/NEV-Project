I HAVE HAD TO GET IT TOWED TWICE NOW BECAUSE IT CONTINUES TO OVER HEAT DUE TO A LACK OF COOLANT (IT DISAPPEARS FOR SOME REASON AND NO ONE KNOW WHERE IT GOES). I THEN HAVE TO GET A RENTAL CAR FOR THE WEEK OR HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES THEM TO FIX IT. FORD DOES NOT HAVE A PLAN TO FIX THE ISSUE INSTEAD THEY WILL INSTALL A SENSOR TO HELP MONITOR THE COOLANT LEVEL AND WARN ME BEFORE THE CAR OVERHEATS. THIS JUST TRANSFER THE BURDEN ONTO ME TO CONTINUOUSLY ADD COOLANT TO A NEW CAR THAT SHOULDN'T NEED IT HAD IT BEEN MADE CORRECTLY. AT THIS POINT I DON'T EVEN WANT THE CAR ANYMORE BECAUSE IT IS UNSAFE AND A HUGE INCONVENIENCE. THIS HAPPENS WHILE I AM DRIVING AND IT WARNS ME TO IMMEDIATELY PULL OVER.",
