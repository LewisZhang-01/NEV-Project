I WAS DRIVING AS NORMAL THEN THERE WAS AN INITIAL LOSS OF POWER AS I NOTICED THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND AN UNFAMILIAR ORANGE WRENCH WERE NOW ILLUMINATED. SEEMING AS I HAD NO POWER I CAUTIOUSLY GUIDED THE VEHICLE TO THE SHOULDER OF THE EXPRESSWAY. SINCE THEN I'VE TRIED HAVING THE PROBLEM FIXED TO NO AVAIL, BECAUSE IT'S INTERMITTENT AND FORD THEMSELVES HAVE NO REMEDY. ALSO, TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO CONTACT FORD TO BE TOLD THE VEHICLE IS PAST WARRANTY SO GO THE DEALER AND HAVE THEM LOOK AT THE VEHICLE. THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR THE PAST 2 MONTHS OF OWNING THIS VEHICLE AND STILL OCCURRING OCCASIONALLY.",
