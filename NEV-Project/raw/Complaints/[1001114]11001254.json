THIS HAPPENS AFTER AN ABS EVENT LIKE GOING AROUND A ROUGH CORNER WHILE BRAKING. THIS HAS HAPPENED IN THE SNOW, RAIN, AND IN DRY CONDITIONS. IT IS INCONSISTENT BUT HAPPENS THE SAME WAY EVERY TIME. SOMETIMES NORMAL BRAKING RETURNS BUT SOMETIMES IT CAN TAKE UP TO 10 MINUTES FOR RETURNING BRAKE PRESSURE. IT HAS CAUSED SEVERAL NEAR ACCIDENTS AND I NO LONGER TRUST THE VEHICLE.",
