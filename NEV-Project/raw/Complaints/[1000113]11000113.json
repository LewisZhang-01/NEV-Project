I WOULD RELEASE AND STEP ON THE GAS PEDAL AND IT WOULD REV UP A LITTLE, BUT THEN THE POWER WOULD DROP OFF AGAIN ALMOST DIED EACH TIME. I TOOK THE VEHICLE INTO THE DEALER FOR SERVICE UNDER WARRANTY AND THEY WERE ABLE TO FIX IT. THE TRANSMISSION WAS NOT SHIFTING DOWN UNDER LOAD AS IT SHOULD HAVE. IT NOW APPEARS TO BE WORKING PROPERLY. IF THE ENGINE HAD QUIT, POWER STEERING AND BRAKES WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST AND IF THAT HAD HAPPENED I MAY HAVE ROLLED BACK DOWN THE HILL, THROUGH A BARRICADE AND ONTO THE FREEWAY ABOUT 30 FEET BELOW. THANK GOD THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.",
