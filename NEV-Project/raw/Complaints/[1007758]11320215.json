EACH TIME THE CAR MAKES A TERRIBLE RATTLING NOISE. THE CAR LOSES POWER, HAS NO PICK UP, GOES LIMP. IT IS A MANUAL, AND WHEN I PUT IT IN 1ST OR 2ND GEAR, IT WILL NOT GO ABOVE 2RPMS ON THE DIAL. I USUALLY SHIFT WHEN IT GETS TO 3. NO WARNING LIGHTS OF ANY KIND COME ON. I MANAGED TO GET IT NOT TO STALL ON THE HIGHWAY, BUT BOTH TIMES I HAVE NOT HAD TO STOP AT A LIGHT OR ANYTHING. BOTH TIMES I LET IT SIT OVERNIGHT, AND IT WAS FINE IN THE MORNING. AFTER THE FIRST TIME I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY FOUND NOTHING. I HAVE CONTACTED CHRYSLER AND HAVE A CASE NUMBER.",
