        "summary": "PURCHASED 2016 FORD EXPLORER IN APRIL OF 2016. INITIALLY, SHORTLY AFTER THE PURCHASE, I CONTINUALLY NOTICED THE SMELL OF BURNING PLASTIC FROM THE ENGINE AREA AFTER A LOT OF CITY DRIVING. I ASSUMED IT WAS THE FACT THE VEHICLE WAS NEW AND WAS STILL BREAKING IN. SEVERAL MONTHS WENT BY AND I SIMPLY BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO IT. READ ONLINE ABOUT PLASTIC BAGS MAKING THAT SMELL SOMETIMES WHEN STUCK ON THE HOT EXHAUST PIPES AND THOUGHT IT COULD BE THAT. DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT MUCH BECAUSE IT WAS NOT OVERBEARING IN THE CABIN. HOWEVER, AS OF SEVERAL WEEKS AGO, SMELL WAS GETTING WORSE SO I MENTIONED TO DEALER. THEY TOLD ME IT'S AN EXHAUST LEAK. IT'S TAKEN TWO WEEKS TO ORDER THE PARTS AND GET ME RESCHEDULED FOR SERVICE AND THE SMELL HAS BECOME MUCH WORSE SINCE THAT VISIT. WONDERING IF TECH LOOSENED EXHAUST SYSTEM. VERY HARD TO DRIVE WITH THE WINDOWS UP - NEEDS CONSTANT FLOW OF FRESH AIR. SMELLS MORE LIKE \"TYPICAL\" EXHAUST SMELL NOW - INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE. I DRIVE 30-50 MILES IN THE CITY EACH DAY, SO IT'S A CONSTANT SMELL. CAN'T PARK IN THE GARAGE BECAUSE ODOR GETS INTO THE HOUSE. JUST LEARNING THAT IT'S AN EXHAUST LEAK HAS ME WORRIED BECAUSE I HAVE TOLERATED THIS FOR OVER A YEAR.",
