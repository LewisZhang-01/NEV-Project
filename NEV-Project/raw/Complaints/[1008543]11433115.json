        "summary": "The contact owns a 2013 Ford Escape. The contact stated his wife was driving 75 MPH when the low coolant warning light illuminated, and the vehicle decelerated independently. The driver pulled the vehicle over to the side of the road and called her husband to meet her so the contact could add water in the coolant so the driver could restart the vehicle and continue to drive to the residence. The contact took the vehicle to an independent mechanic to be diagnosed. The contact was informed that there was a coolant leak coming from the engine block. The vehicle was not repaired. The manufacturer was made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 137,000.",
