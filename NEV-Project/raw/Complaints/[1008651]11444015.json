The car came to a stop out in the middle of the street even though there was nothing in front of or around the vehicle. It was a good thing there was not a car behind me or they would have rear-ended my vehicle and we or the people in the car that hit us could have gotten seriously hurt. I took the car to the dealer and they did a diagnostics check and said no codes came up so there was nothing wrong with the car. They actually told me that when and if it happens again to videotape it for proof.",
