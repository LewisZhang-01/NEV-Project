I BELIEVE THE BRAKE PARTS BECOME HOT AND CREATE SOMETHING GOOGLE SEARCHES CALL \"JUDDER\".  I HAVE HAD THE STEERING WILL START SHAKING AS WELL.  AFTER REPEATED REQUESTS TO MAZDA CORPORATE AND VISITS TO TWO DEALERS, MAZDA CLAIMS THE BRAKES WORK AS DESIGNED.  ONE SERVICE MANAGER AT BROWNING MAZDA STATED THE FRONT ROTORS ARE TOO SMALL TO STOP A CAR OF THIS WEIGHT, BUT THIS STATEMENT IS NOT WRITTEN.    REGARDING THE VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL, WHEN I TURN LEFT AND GO DOWNHILL FROM MY DRIVEWAY AT A SLOW SPEED OF APPROX 10MPH, I USUALLY HAVE NO THROTTLE CONTROL.  I NEED TO APPLY THE BRAKES TO REGAIN ANY CONTROL OF THE THROTTLE.  ONCE AGAIN TWO DEALERS TELL ME THIS IS WITHIN DESIGN SPECS.  MAYBE THIS IS TRUE, HOWEVER, I HAVE NO WAY TO IMMEDIATELY GET OUT OF THE WAY OF OTHER CARS AS I HAVE TO BRAKE FIRST FOR THE THROTTLE TO RETURN.  DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT TO ME.    ALSO, MY COMBINED MPG IS ABOUT 13.7 WHEN MAZDA STATES IT SHOULD BE ABOUT 18.  HOW CAN THEY MAKE SUCH A  CLAIM LIKE THIS AND GET AWAY WITH IT.  IT IS NOT JUST MY CX-9, MANY PEOPLE COMPLAIN ON THE INTERNET.  AGAIN, MAZDA STATES THE CAR IS WITHIN SPECS.",
