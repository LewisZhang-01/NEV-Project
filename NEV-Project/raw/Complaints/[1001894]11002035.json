        "summary": "WHEN USING THE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL IT MAINTAINS A USER SPECIFIED TRAVELLING DISTANCE BEHIND THE VEHICLE IN FRONT.  WHEN THE VEHICLE CHANGES LANES, OR IS TURNING OFF, THE VEHICLE IS BARELY OFF THE LANE, BUT THE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL STILL REACTS TO THE CAR THAT HAS EXITED THE LANE.  THIS CAUSES MY TOYOTA TO REACT TO THE SLOWED VEHICLE THAT HAS JUST EXITED MY LANE BY SLOWING UNNECESSARILY, AND CAUSING VEHICLES BEHIND ME TO HAVE TO SLOW AND SOME TIMES GET IRRITATED BY THIS ACTION.  I TOLD TOYOTA ABOUT THIS.  I WAS TOLD THERE IS A FIX ON THE WAY, BUT NO ACTION HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE PAST 3 YEARS.  A TECH DROVE THE CAR ON THE ROAD IN FRONT OF THE DEALERSHIP, BUT HE OBVIOUSLY DID NOT DRIVE THE CAR ENOUGH, BECAUSE IF HE HAD, HE SHOULD HAVE NOTICED THIS ODD BEHAVIOR.  IT HAPPENS SOME ON THE INTERSTATE, BUT IS MORE PRONOUNCED BEHAVIOR WHEN ON 2 LAND ROADS.  THIS BEHAVIOR HAS OCCURRED EVER SINCE WE BOUGHT IT NEW.",
