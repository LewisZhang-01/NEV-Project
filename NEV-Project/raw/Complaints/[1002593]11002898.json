        "summary": "WE PURCHASED A 2017 TUSCON LIMITED AWD WITH A DUAL CLUTCH TRANSMISSION. SINCE WE'VE HAD THIS SUV IT HAS THIS PROBLEM. I HAD MENTIONED IT TO THE DEALER AND I FINALLY TOOK IT IN TO HAVE THEM LOOK AT IT. FROM A STOP ESPECIALLY ON A HILL AND TURNING THE SUV HESITATES THEN KICKS IN AND HESITATES AGAIN, SENDING ME FORWARD IN MY SEAT. I HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS WHEN TAKING OFF FROM A STOP THE VEHICLE HESITATES SO BADLY I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO BE HIT.  BOTTOM LINE I DON'T FEEL SAFE IN MY VEHICLE. I TOOK THE TUSCON BACK TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAY IT'S EXPECTED BEHAVIOR FOR THE DUAL CLUTCH TRANSMISSION. THEIR ADVICE IS TO DRIVE IN SPORTS MODE ALL OF THE TIME AND NOT IN THE ECONO MODE. ECONO IS THE DEFAULT MODE AND (IS USED TO SAVE ON GAS) NOT SPORT SO I HAVE TO MAKE SURE I TURN IT ON EVERY TIME I START THE CAR AND THERE IS NO WAY TO DEFAULT IT TO SPORTS. MY QUESTION IS WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO DRIVE IN SPORTS MODE TO FEEL SAFER. I PURCHASED THE CAR NEW AND HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM SINCE WE PURCHASED IT.  I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH AND IT APPEARS THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE DUAL CLUTCH TRANSMISSION, I'VE SEEN SEVERAL COMPLAINTS WITH THE 2017 AS WELL.",
