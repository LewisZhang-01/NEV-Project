AIR BAG LIGHT WAS COMING ON SPORADICALLY AND INCREASINGLY OFTEN.  WORK PERFORMED, IF ANY, BY JACKSONS OF ENID DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.  AIR BAG LIGHT CAME ON WITHIN A MILE OF THE BUSINESS AND CONTINUES AT VARIOUS SPEEDS AND FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME.  OUTER TIE ROD ASSEMBLY???  CAN'T TELL. .  WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?  WAIT UNTIL THE AIRBAG INFLATES WHILE I AM DRIVING, POSSIBLY INJURING MYSELF OR OTHERS? OR MAYBE LOSE A FRONT WHEEL?  THIS IS NOT THE ONLY DISTURBING ENCOUNTER THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED AT THIS BUSINESS.  CALL ME ((580) 984-1200).   I DO NOT TRUST JACKSONS OF ENID AND THEY ARE THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN.  TRIED TO CONTACT BBB, BUT THEY ARE NOT BBB AFFILIATED.  GO FIGURE.",
