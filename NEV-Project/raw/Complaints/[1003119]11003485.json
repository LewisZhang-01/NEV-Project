NO VOICE, LIGHT OR ANY ALERTS THAT ALERT THE DRIVER TO LOCK THE DOORS MANUALLY EVERY TIME YOU DRIVE THE CAR. THIS A SAFETY ISSUE AS IF YOU FORGET TO LOCK THE DOORS MANUALLY AND BY ANY CHANCE SNAPS ON THE DOOR HANDLE, CAR DOOR WILL OPEN AND FATALITIES CAN OCCUR. SPOKE WITH SERVICE ADVISOR AT MY SUBARU DEALER AND HE STATED THAT THIS ISSUE IS REAL AND THERE IS NO WAY TO PROGRAM THE VEHICLE TO LOCK THE FRONT DOORS AUTOMATICALLY WHEN IT IS IN DRIVE OR AT CERTAIN SPEED. I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER CARS THAT HAVE SAME ISSUE, EVEN OLDER CARS 10 PLUS YEARS OLD CARS HAS THIS SAFETY FEATURE AS STANDARD. THIS ISSUE IS NOT MENTIONED ANYWHERE IN THE VEHICLE MANUAL AND SALES PERSONS DO NOT TALK ABOUT. IN MY OPINION THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND A KEY FACTOR WHEN CHOOSING TO BUY SUBARU OUTBACK.",
