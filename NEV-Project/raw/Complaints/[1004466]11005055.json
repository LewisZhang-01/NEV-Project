AT 21K MILES I HAD TO REPLACE THE POWER SHIFT DUAL CLUTCH, AND I AM NOW AT 33K MILES AND I AM ON MY SECOND CLUTCH REPLACEMENT DUE TO SLIPPING, BUCKING, KICKING, AND JERKING FROM THE TRANSMISSION. FORD IS REFUSING TO LIST THIS AS A RECALL; . MY CAR IS ACTUALLY GETTING THE NEW CLUTCH INSTALLED THIS WEEK. I JUST RECEIVED IN THE MAIL A CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT IS BEING PURSUED AGAINST FORD FOR THIS ON GOING ISSUE WITH THESE FOCUS'S. I JUST WANT TO MAKE OTHER MOTORIST AWARE IF THEY ARE FEELING THESE SAME THINGS FROM THEIR FOCUS OR FIESTA YEARS 2011-2016 PLEASE SEE ABOUT GETTING IT CHECKED OUT. IT'S NOT NORMAL FOR THESE CARS TO BE DOING THIS.",
