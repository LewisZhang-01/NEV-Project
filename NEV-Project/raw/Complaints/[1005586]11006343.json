WHEN YOU TRY TO ACCELERATE THE CAR WILL SHIFT GEARS AND USUALLY DURING THE 2ND TO 3RD GEAR SHIFT THE TRANSMISSION MISSING AND YOUR RPMS SHOOT.  ONCE REVS COME DOWN THE CAR SLIPS INTO GEAR.  VERY DANGEROUS IN TRAFFIC BECAUSE YOU CAN PULL OUT OF A DRIVEWAY OR ENTER A ROAD AND THEN NO POWER BECAUSE THE GEAR SLIPPED.  DEALERS WAS INFORMED AND AN UPDATE WAS APPLIED TO THE ECU.  WORKED FOR A SHORT PERIOD AND NOW CAR DOES IT AGAIN.",
