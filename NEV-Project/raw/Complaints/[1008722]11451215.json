        "summary": "Failure of all Door Locks.  I purchased my 2008 Honda CRV new in 2008.  While driving all door locks move up and down or open and close and cannot be locked or open with the remote device.  After checking on line, I see there have been recalls of similar problems with this model.  I called First Honda in Simi Valley, CA and was told there was a recall but not for my 2008 Honda.  This is for sure a safety problem which amazes me when companies that build these cars have so many problems.  I understand that if I need to repair the five locks it will cost me over a $1000.  I am a senior citizen with limited income and cannot afford a new car so I am between a rock and a hard place.  If there is a recall out there, please let me know so I can get this problem fixed. Thank you",
