MY VEHICLE IS VERY UNSAFE TO DRIVE AS THE BRAKE PEDAL IS AS SOLID AS A ROCK AND HAS THE FEELING OF \"SLIDING ON ICE\" YEAR ROUND. THIS PROBLEM HAS PROGRESSED DRAMATICALLY AND QUICKLY. A VERY LOUD HISSING AS IF AIR IS LEAKING BY THE BRAKE PEDAL OCCURS WHEN BRAKING. ABS LIGHTS DO NOT COME ON AND NOTHING ELSE IS AFFECTED SAFETY WISE. VEHICLE SIMPLY BRAKED POORLY AND FEELS LIKE IT WILL NOT STOP. FORD HAS CREATED A \"CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM\" FOR MY EXACT ISSUE BUT WILL NOT APPLY THEIR WARRANTY/RECALL HELP TO MY VEHICLE DUE TO THE YEAR (2007). THEY SAID IF IT WAS A 2010 OR NEWER THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT. IM HAVING THE EXACT SAME ISSUE WITH THE SAME PARTS CONSUMERS HAVE WITH THE 2010 MODELS AND NEWER. ITS RIDICULOUS THAT FORD CAN EXCLUDE ME FROM SOMETHING THEY ARE ACCEPTING FAULT FOR. THIS IS CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AT ITS WORST. I WANT FORD TO FIX MY BRAKE BOOSTER AND SYSTEM COMPONENTS AS NEEDED TO SAFELY BRAKE ON PUBLIC ROADS.",
