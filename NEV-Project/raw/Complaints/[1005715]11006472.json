WHEN THE DEALER TESTED IT THEY SAID IT FALLS OUTSIDE OF THE VERY NARROW PARAMETERS THAT VW DEFINED TO COVER THE ABS MODULE FAILURE AND I WOULD NEED TO PAY $2,700 TO REPLACE THE ABS MODULE.  THE SERVICE MANAGER CONFIDENTIALLY TOLD ME THEY ARE SEEING A LARGE NUMBER OF SUDDEN ABS MODULE FAILURES AND VW IS NOT COVERING VERY MANY.  THEY WROTE THE RECALL AND TEST PROCEDURE TO AVOID HAVING TO COVER THE REPAIR.  I BELIEVE THIS IS A BLATANT EFFORT BY VW TO AVOID THE EXPENSE OF ANOTHER COSTLY RECALL ON THE HEELS OF THE DIESEL DEBACLE.  I BELIEVE THIS ABS SCANDAL IS A GREAT CANDIDATE FOR ANOTHER CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST VW",
