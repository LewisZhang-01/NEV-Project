        "summary": "PURCHASED MY 2015 JEEP CHEROKEE  IN SEPTEMBER 2015 BRAND NEW WITH 19 MILES. THE CAR STARTED OFF RUNNING  GREAT I LOVED IT. BY APRIL 2016, I NOTICED THE CAR BEGAN TO DRIVE DIFFERENTLY AND AT FIRST I DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT BUT IT GOT WORSE AND WORSE. BY OCTOBER MY CAR WAS JERKING SO BAD, STALLING SOMETIMES AND ACCELERATING SOMETIMES ON IT'S  ON.I TOOK IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION WITH ONLY  11000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE.  MY CAR DROVE LIKE IT ONCE USED TO UNTIL ABOUT THE END OF JANUARY 2017. THE CAR BEGAN TO ACCELERATE ON ITS OWN ONCE AGAIN  JUMPING FROM 1GEAR TO 3 GEAR AND BACK. IN FEBRUARY ON MY WAY TO WORK MY SHIFTER LOCKED ON ME AND WENT COMPLETELY OUT CAUSING ME TO COME TO A COMPLETE STOP. THANK GOD IT WAS 4AM AND NO CARS WERE OUT BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN IN A CAR ACCIDENT. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND EXPRESSED MY TROUBLES WITH THE CAR AND THEY CHANGED THE SHIFTER AND DID SOME UPDATE ON THE CAR SAYING THAT THAT'S WHY MY CAR WAS DRIVING THE WAY IT WAS. THE VERY NEXT FRIDAY AFTER GETTING MY CAR BACK FROM THEM, I ALMOST HIT THE BACK OF A CAR COMING DOWN STREET WITH A SLIGHT INCLINE AND THE VEHICLE SPED UP ON IT OWN WITHOUT ME PRESSING THE GAS FROM 25MPH TO 45MPH JUMPING FROM 2 TO 4 GEAR. THE CAR JERKED SO HARD FELT LIKE I HAD BEEN HIT BY ANOTHER CAR. I CALLED JEEP AND TOLD THEM I WAS BRINGING THE CAR BACK IT WAS NOT FIXED AND I ALMOST HAD AN ACCIDENT. WHEN THEY GOT THE VEHICLE,  THEY CLAIMED WHEN THEY DROVE THE VEHICLE IT PERFORMED HOW IT WAS SUPPOSED.I HAVE BEEN HAVING NOTHING BUT TROUBLE WITH THIS CAR SINCE THEY REPLACED THE  TRANSMISSION. I CALLED CHRYSTLER MYSELF TO EXPRESS MY ISSUES WITH MY CAR AND THEY PRETENDED TO CAR AT FIRST AND BARELY GOT IN TOUCH WITH ME TOWARDS THE END OF IT. FINALLY, I FOUND A LEMON LAW ATTORNEY AND I AM CURRENTLY FIGHTING THEM TO BUY THIS VEHICLE BACK. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN THIS CAR.",
