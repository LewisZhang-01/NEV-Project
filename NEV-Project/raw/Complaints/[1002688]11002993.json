I CONTACTED GRACO ABOUT THIS AND THEY ADVISED ME TO EDUCATE THE CHILD ON THE DANGERS OF TRAVELING WITHOUT A SEATBELT - TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO EDUCATE A 14MONTH CHILD ON ANY KIND OF DANGERS, THEY ALSO TOLD ME DEVICES WERE ON THE MARKET TO PREVENT THIS BUT IT WAS NOT ADVISABLE TO PURCHASE THESE AS THEY ARE NOT GRACO APPROVED. THIS CAR CHAIR IS TOTALLY UNSUITABLE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN THAT DO NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF UNDERSTANDING DANGER.",
