        "summary": "IN JANUARY 2017, WE TOOK OUR TRAILER TO TRANSWEST TO BE SERVICED. AT THAT TIME TRANSWEST PERFORMED A 2 AXLE SAFETY CHECK AND FOUND THE DRIVER SIDE BRAKE SHOES GROOVED AND CRACKED, PASSENGER SIDE BRAKES FOULED WITH GREASE (WHEEL SEALS FAILED) AND BEARINGS PITTED DUE TO WHEEL SEAL FAILURE. TRANSWEST THEN REPLACED ALL 4 BRAKE ASSEMBLIES, SEALS AND REPLACED FRONT AXLE INNER AND OUTER BEARINGS. THIS TRAILER IS LESS THAN TWO YEARS OLD. WE HAULED IT APPROXIMATELY 400 MILES AFTER THOSE REPAIRS AND THEN LAST WEEKEND WE HAULED 15 MILES TO A LOCAL HORSE TRAIL. WE PULLED INTO CAMP TO PARK ONLY TO FIND THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR WHEEL AND TIRE WAS COMPLETELY GONE. WE DIDN'T HEAR OR SEE THIS HAPPEN WHILE DRIVING AND WERE LUCKY THAT NO ONE GOT HURT FROM THE WHEEL AND TIRE SEPARATING FROM THE TRAILER. AFTER GETTING THE TRAILER SERVICED ENOUGH THAT WE COULD GET OUR HORSES HOME AND THE TRAILER BACK TO THE DEALER FOR SERVICE, WE TRACED BACK OUR ROUTE TO TRY TO FIND THE TIRE AND WHEEL BUT ONLY FOUND SOME BRAKE PARTS ON THE ROAD. WE DID FIND THOSE PARTS ABOUT 4-5 MILES FROM OUR HOME AND AT THAT POINT WERE PROBABLY TRAVELING AROUND 50 MPH ON A RURAL HIGHWAY. THE TRAILER HAS BEEN AT THE DEALER FOR THE PAST WEEK AND NOW THEY TELL US THE GREASE SEALS FAILED, THE BEARINGS FAILED AND WE JUST HAD THOSE ITEMS SERVICED 400 MILES AGO IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR. WE ARE NOT SURE THAT THESE AXLES ARE SAFE. THEY ARE LIPPERT AXLES AND THE SHOULD BE RECALLED.",
