        "summary": "When I tried to start my vehicle this morning after a store run. the car clicked multiple times and made a weird noise, then went dead. I popped my hood immediately and saw a hole the size of a quarter next to the battery terminal and smoke was coming out the hole.  I had driven it 40 miles before I had put it in park, and it drove fine before that.  I have showed multiple people pictures of the battery (including mechanics) and no one had ever seen anything like that. I decided to google to see if it's a known problem/recall on the Rav4 and found that the NHTSA was investigating the batteries due to similar instances.  Thankfully my car did not catch fire, and I was smart and decided not to start it again. Otherwise something bad could have happened.",
