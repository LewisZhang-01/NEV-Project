I DROVE IT 30 MILES TO TRY TO GET WITHIN CELL PHONE RANGE BEFORE IT SIMPLY QUIT. THANK GOODNESS I HAD JUST RENEWED MY UCONNECT CONTRACT BECAUSE I STILL WAS NOT WITHIN CELL PHONE RANGE WHEN CAR DIED. A TOW TRUCK WAS CALLED AND CAR TOWED TO NEAREST JEEP FACILITY THAT COULD REPAIR IT.  RESULT OF PROBLEM WAS BAD ALTERNATOR.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS ON A CAR THAT IS LESS THAN 2.5 YEARS OF AGE AND DRIVEN LESS THAN 3,6000 MILES.I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO WARNING OF PROBLEM UNTIL I WAS TRAVELING 150 MILES AWAY FROM HOME IN A MOUNTAINOUS AND SPARSELY TRAVELED ROAD. JEEP WAS UNDER WARRANTY BUT I AM UNEASY NOW ABOUT POTENTIAL  OTHER PROBLEMS  OCCURRING.",
