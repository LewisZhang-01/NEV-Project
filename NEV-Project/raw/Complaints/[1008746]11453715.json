        "summary": "My vehicle is having issues regarding the clutch and transmission module.  This issue has been going on every since I bought my vehicle new in 2015. The last time they fixed the issue (free) was in May of 2020. When I went to the dealership where I bought my car and where they have replaced this issue, I was told that they will have to charge me to diagnose the problem. I told them that they never charged me before and the issue it\u2019s having is the same so why today are you charging me? They said that it\u2019s because it could be the clutch issue that\u2019s not covered.  However they have fixed the clutch issue before in which that time was May 2029. The for recall for my vehicle is 18V169000 to be fixed up to 150,000 miles my vehicle has 102,000 miles. Another recall that I looked up is 18S07 which is regarding the clutch. Website https://www.cars.com/research/ford-focus-2015/recalls/ So why will they not fix my car when both recall # say they will be fixed at no charge to me.",
