        "summary": "I PICKED UP THIS FORD FIESTA 5DR VEHICLE 9/29/2016 (AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION) NEW & AT THAT TIME I NOTICED THAT THE STEERING COLUMN LOCK/UNLOCK LEVER FOR THE TILT/ TELESCOPIC WHEEL WAS VERY HARD FOR ME TO ENGAGE/DISENGAGE TO ADJUST THE HEIGHT OF THE STEERING WHEEL.. I ASKED AT THAT TIME IF THE LEVER COULD BE ADJUSTED FOR EASE SINCE I AM A 76 Y/O FEMALE WITH NOT MUCH STRENGTH IN MY HANDS, PERHAPS IF I WERE A 20 Y/O AGILE MALE IT WOULDN'T BE SUCH AN ISSUE.. I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT THEY COULD NOT ADJUST THAT SINCE IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE TO CHANGE THAT; WHILE I UNDERSTAND THE SAFETY THING I ALSO KNOW THAT MY HAND, THUMB, ARM & WRIST ARE SUFFERING FROM THIS 'DESIGN FLAW' & I WILL SPEAK WITH MY DOCTOR NEXT WEEK IN REGARD TO THIS PAIN.. I'M NOT SURE WHO DESIGNED THIS LEVER TO BE SO HARD FOR SOME PEOPLE TO USE & ADJUST BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY DIDN'T TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION OLDER FEMALE DRIVERS .. WHILE I PAID FOR THIS FEATURE OF THE TILT/ TELESCOPIC WHEEL I'M HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS FEATURE BECAUSE OF THE LEVER ISSUE; IN ADDITION I AM SHORT SO NEED TO GET CLOSER TO THE STEERING WHEEL TO DRIVE COMFORTABLY.. SHAME ON THE AUTO DESIGNER FOR WHAT I CONSIDER A DESIGN FLAW DONE WITHOUT TESTING BEFORE RELEASING TO THE ENTIRE PUBLIC..",
