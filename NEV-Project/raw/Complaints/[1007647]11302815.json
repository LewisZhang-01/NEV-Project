OVER TIME THIS MAY LEAD TO OTHER ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS AS IT IS NEVER GOOD TO HAVE WATER ACCUMULATING IN THE TAIL LIGHTS.  THE BACKUP CAMERA IS ALSO SHARED IN THIS COMPONENT.  THIS APPEARS TO BE A KNOWN ISSUE THAT FCA DODGE APPEARS TO BE IGNORING.  THE ONLY SOLUTION OFFERED IS TO REPLACE THE COMPONENT WITH ANOTHER WHICH INCLUDES THE BACKUP CAMERA FOR $1000.",
