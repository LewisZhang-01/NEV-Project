A DAY AFTER IT DEPARTURE, IT WAS SHIPPED TO TAMPA FLORIDA BECAUSE OF MY UNIVERSITY. UPON RECEIPT THE CAR WAS OIL-FREE, AND ALL THE SAFETY LIGHTS WERE CAUGHT. THE CAR STARTED TO VIBRATE, AND THERE WAS NO LONGER ENOUGH CAPACITY TO PUSH AND THE TIRES BEGAN TO FALL. MASTRO SUBARU REFUSED TO FIX THE PROBLEM EXCEPT BY PAYING MONEY. AFTER RESEARCH, I DISCOVERED THAT THIS CAR IS NOT THE ONLY ONE AND THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM IN ALL CARS OF THIS TYPE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE IS MANY RECALLS IN THIS CAR ONE OF THEM IT IS (VDC) VEHICLE DYNAMIC CONTROL. NOW THE CAR SO DANGEROUS TO DRIVE, I PARKED THE CAR AND NO MONEY TO DO ANYTHING. PLEASE I NEED HELP , I HAVE THREE KIDS.",
