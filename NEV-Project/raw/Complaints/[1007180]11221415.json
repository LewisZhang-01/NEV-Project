        "summary": "THE FLYWHEEL HAS BROKEN AND THIS APPEARS TO BE A VERY COMMON PROBLEM THAT MANY HAVE HAD TO REPAIR. THERE SEEMS TO BE A MISALIGNMENT ISSUE OR A WEAKNESS IN THE MATERIAL USED TO MANUFACTURE THE FLYWHEEL. THE VAN STARTED WITH A SOUND SIMILAR TO THE VIBRATION OF A LOOSE HEAT SHIELD. THEN CAME THE VIBRATION AND SHAKING AT IDOL, SIMILAR TO AN ENGINE MISS ON ONE OF THE CYLINDERS. NO OF THOSE WERE THE PROBLEM. THEN, THE VAN WAS IN MOTION AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT WOULDN'T GO WHILE PRESSING THE ACCELERATOR. PULLED THE VAN TO THE SIDE. SHUT DOWN THE ENGINE AND TRIED TO RESTART. THE STARTER NOW SPINS FREELY WITH NO RESISTANCE. THIS SHOULD HAVE BECOME A RECALL A FEW YEARS AGO AND CORRECTED BEFORE THIS MODEL WAS EVER MANUFACTURED.",
