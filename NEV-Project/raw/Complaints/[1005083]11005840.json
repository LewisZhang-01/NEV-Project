MERELY TWO DAYS LATER, I WOKE UP TO FIND THE CRACK HAD EXTENDED 3/4 OF THE WAY ACROSS MY ENTIRE WINDSHIELD AND COMPLETELY UP AND DOWN THE ENTIRE HEIGHT OF THE WINDSHIELD - JUST OUT OF THE BLUE, OVERNIGHT. IT'S NOW DIFFICULT TO PROPERLY SEE OUT OF THE WINDSHIELD AS ONE OF THE CRACKS RUNS RIGHT IN MY LINE OF VISION WITH THE ROAD. FOR SOMETHING SO MINOR TO CREATE SUCH A MAJOR EFFECT ON MY CAR THAT IS NOT QUITE 14 MONTHS OLD IS QUITE DISTURBING.",
