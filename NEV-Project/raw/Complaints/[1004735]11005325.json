MY 2006 HONDA HAS 142,000 MILES AND HAS BEEN RUNNING VERY WELL UP TO THIS POINT. APPARENTLY IF MY ENGINE BLOCK WOULD HAVE CRACKED 10 MONTHS AGO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER WARRANTY. BUT BECAUSE IT'S A 2006 AND THE WARRANTY ONLY LASTS FOR 10 YEARS I AM OUT OF LUCK. MY CAR THAT WAS WORTH $5000 TO $6000 A WEEK AGO IS NOW VALUED AT $0. I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE JUST STOLE MY CAR OR AT LEAST WRECKED IT. I HAVE CHECKED WITH MY HONDA DEALER AND HONDA CORP. NEITHER ARE WILLING TO HELP WITH A NEW ENGINE REPAIR, I REALIZE THAT MY CAR IS 11 YEARS OLD, BUT WHEN I PURCHASED THIS HONDA I FIGURED IT WOULD GO AT LEAST 250,000 MILES. THAT IS WHY I BOUGHT IT. I HESITATE REPAIRING THE CAR, WHICH WILL RUN ABOUT $1800 BECAUSE THE NEW ENGINE BLOCK COULD ALSO CRACK! HONDA KNOWS THERE IS AN ENGINE BLOCK PROBLEM, BUT THEY ARE UNWILLING TO RESOLVE IT.",
