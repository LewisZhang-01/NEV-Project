The dealership we bought it from didn\u2019t even admit there is a problem so we had to take it to another dealership which actually admitted there is a problem.  They just changed the drive shaft and rear differential and the problem is still there . It\u2019s been in service longer than it\u2019s been with me. Very frustrating.",
