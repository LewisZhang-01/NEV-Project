DEALERSHIP REFUSED TO FIX BECAUSE I HAD TAKEN A LIGHT HIT TO THE REAR FENDER AREA WHERE THE SENSOR IS ON 02/06/2016.  FRIENDS TOLD ME THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THESE VEHICLES SO I LOOKED ONLINE AND WAS APPALLED AT THE COMPLAINTS!  I AM RETIRED AND ON A FIXED INCOME AND CAN'T AFFORD THE $1,600 OR MORE RIGHT NOW.  AS A SENIOR THIS WAS A REASON I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE.  NOW THAT IT DOES NOT WORK I HAVE TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL WITH BLIND SPOTS!  THIS WARNING CAME ON AND FUNCTION STOPPED WORKING WHEN CAR WAS TURNED ON.",
