LOW BEAMS ILLUMINATE ROAD ONLY DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF VEHICLE AND NOT ENOUGH FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD CAUSING AN UNSAFE CONDITION OF 'OVER DRIVING' THE HEADLIGHTS. THIS CONDITION PERSISTED EVEN AFTER HAVING A HONDA DEALER ADJUST THE HEADLIGHTS. IN ADDITION THE HIGH BEAMS ARE PRACTICALLY NON-EXISTENT COMPARED TO ALL OTHER VEHICLES I HAVE OWNED. THEY TOO ARE TOTALLY INADEQUATE. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO PASS A DOT TEST. IF THEY ARE ABLE TO PASS A DOT TEST THEN I WOULD SAY YOUR TEST IS NOT STRINGENT ENOUGH. THANK YOU FOR LOOKING INTO THIS TO SEE IF IT IS A SEVERE ENOUGH SAFETY ISSUE TO REQUIRE A RECALL.",
