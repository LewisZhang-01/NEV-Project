        "summary": "ON MAY 4, 2017 I WAS AT A RED LIGHT ON A VERY BUSY HIGHWAY WHEN THE VEHICLE'S ENGINE JUST SHUT OFF. CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND ANOTHER WRENCH SYMBOL LIGHT CAME ON. I GOT IT STARTED AGAIN BUT WAS VERY SLOW ACCELERATING AND WITHIN A FEW FEET IT STOPPED ACCELERATING EVEN WHEN PRESSING ON THE GAS ALL THE WAY.  I WAS STUCK TRYING TO COAST THROUGH A VERY BUSY INTERSECTION UNTIL I COULD GET IT IN A PARKING LOT.IT WOULD RESTART BUT WOULD NOT ACCELERATE AND THEN ENGINE WAS SHAKING. THEN WOULDN'T START AT ALL. I HAD TO CALL SOMEONE TO PICK ME UP AND THEN A TOW SERVICE TO HAVE IT TOWED TO A MECHANIC SHOP. THE REPAIR SHOP CALLED AND INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS RUNNING BUT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS STILL ON AND IT GAVE A COMPUTER CODE FOR A BAD THROTTLE BODY MOTOR. THEY INFORMED ME AFTER RESEARCHING THAT IS A COMMON AND DANGEROUS OCCURENCE WITH MY VEHICLE TYPE SO THEY REPLACED THE THROTTLE BODY MOTOR. THIS HAD HAPPENED BEFORE IN OCTOBER OF 2016 ON A ROAD TRIP THE TRUCK JUST STOPPED RUNNING WHILE I WAS DRIVING DOWN A HIGHWAY AND I WAS STRANDED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR 30 MINUTES UNTIL IT FINALLY STARTED RUNNING AGAIN. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STAYED ON FOR SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THAT.",
