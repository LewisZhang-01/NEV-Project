ALSO, I HAVE TO MANUALLY TURN OFF MY PARKING LIGHTS. THEY SHOULD TURN OFF ONCE LOCKING MY DOORS  WITH MY KEY FOB, BUT THEY REMAIN ON, SO I TURN THEM OFF MANUALLY OTHERWISE THEY'LL STAY ON THIS DRAINING MY BATTERY. EACH TIME I TURN ON THE CAR, AS SOON AS I SHIFT INTO DRIVE/REVERSE, THE CAR BEGINS TO BEEP AT ME AND THE DASH LIGHTS UP SAYING 'LUGGAGE COMPARTMENT LID OPEN' WHICH IS VERY DISTRACTING. THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME I TURN THE ENGINE ON AFTER SHIFTING INTO GEAR. AFTER RESEARCHING MY PROBLEM, I'VE FOUND THAT MANY OTHER DRIVERS WITH SIMILAR YEARS OF FORD FOCUS HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE. AFTER I FIXED THE WIRES MYSELF, ALL OF THESE SYMPTOMS WENT AWAY. I'M SURPRISED HOW MANY ISSUES THOSE BROKEN WIRES HAVE CAUSED.",
