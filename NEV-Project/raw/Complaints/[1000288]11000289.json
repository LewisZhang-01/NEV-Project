I TOOK THE CAR BACK AND THEY CONFIRMED IT WAS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY, BUT TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO ABOUT IT AND THAT \"I WOULD JUST HAVE TO LIVE WITHOUT IT\".  SINCE THIS IS A SAFETY FEATURE, I THOUGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE CORRECTED IT UNDER WARRANTY. THEY HAVE REFUSED, SO I AM BRINGING THIS TO YOU ATTENTION AND REQUESTING HELP TO GET IT WORKING CORRECTLY.  I HAVE HAD TWO CLOSE CALLS DUE TO THIS PROBLEM. THE DEALER IS DUBLIN CADILLAC, 4200 JOHN MONEGO COURT,DUBLIN, CA.",
