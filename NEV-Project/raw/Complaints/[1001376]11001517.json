        "summary": "THE DEALERSHIP REPLACED THE ORIGINAL TIRES ON OUR 2015 HYUNDIA GENISIS 5.0 WITH CONTIPROCONTACT TIRES DUE TO A RECALL ON THE ORIGINAL HANKOOK TIRES IN JUNE 2016. SINCE THEN WE HAVE REPLACED , ON SIX DIFFERENT ACCATIIONS,ONE OF THE TIRES .THE FIRST TWO, ONE FRONT AND ONE REAR ,WERE BECAUSE OF BUBBLES ON THE SIDEWALL. THE NEXT ONE WAS FROM TREAD SEPERATION ON A REAR TIRE, AND THE LAST TWO ,WERE FRONT TIRES, BOTH FROM BLOW OUTS, AFTER HITTING SMALL POTHOLES AT LOW SPEEDS ON TWO DIFFERENT ACCATIIONS. I HAVE NEVER HAD PROBLEMS LIKE THIS BEFORE,AND I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR OVER 50 YEARS. I THINK THESE TIRES ARE DEFECTIVE AND DANGEROUS.SOME ONE NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING BEFORE PEOPLE START GETTING HURT OR EVEN KILLED FROM THEM.",
