IT HAS BEEN OVER A YEAR AND PLENTY OF TIME TO REPAIR THE PROBLEMS. AS OF TODAY, 7.12.2017, NO RESOLUTION HAS BEEN MADE. THIS  IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN FIXED BY NOW. I CONTACTED MERCEDES ON  6.19.17, THEY STATED THAT THE PROBLEM IS BEING WORKED ON AND THAT \"NO MERCEDES HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM OCCUR\", THAT IS ALL WELL AND GOOD BUT I DO NOT WANT TO BE THE FIRST. ONCE AGAIN, SINCE THIS  IS A DEADLY PROBLEM IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED.    THANKS    [XXX]      INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
