        "summary": "ON THE DATE OF JULY 12, 2017 I WAS ON THE FREEWAY ON MY WAY TO WORK.  TRAFFIC WAS MODERATE.  AS I ATTEMPTED TO BRAKE I NOTICED IT MADE SPRINGY GRINDING SOUND, AND THE BRAKES DID NOT FUNCTION AS WELL.  I ALSO NOTICED THAT THE RED BRAKE LIGHT INDICATOR WAS ON.  IN A SAFE AND DESPERATE MANNER, I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER TO SHOULDER AND PUT MY VEHICLE ON PARK.  AFTER I PLACED MY VEHICLE ON PARK, I TURNED IT OFF AND TURNED OFF, THEN I TURNED IT BACK ON.  ONCE I TURNED IT BACK ON, I NOTICED THAT THE BRAKE LIGHT WAS NO LONGER ON AND THE BRAKES WERE WORKING FINE.      ON JULY 13, 2017, WHILE TRAVELING WITH MY WIFE AND KIDS TO DISNEYLAND, I EXPERIENCED THE SAME INCIDENT AGAIN.  AS I ATTEMPTED TO BRAKE, THE BRAKES MADE A LOUD SPRINGY GRINDING SOUND.  IN ADDITION THE BRAKES DID NOT FUNCTION AS WELL AND THE BRAKE LIGHT WAS ON.  THIS TIME I WAS NOT ABLE TO PULL OVER TO SHOULDER DUE TO HEAVY TRAFFIC.  I HAD TO ACTIVATE MY EMERGENCY LIGHTS AND TURN OFF AND TURN ON MY VEHICLE IN THE MIDDLE LANE.      PLEASE ADHERE TO THIS MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN IMMEDIATELY.  THANK YOU",
