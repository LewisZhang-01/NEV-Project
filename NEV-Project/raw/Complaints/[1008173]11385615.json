THIS TO ME IS A SERIOUS MATTER WHEN IT DEALS WITH THE VEHICLES BRAKING SYSTEM. THERE HAVE BEEN CUSTOMERS ONLINE WHO HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE, WITH ONE CUSTOMER STATED THAT HIS BRAKES DID FAIL AND IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO STOP. I HAVE MADE NUMEROUS CALLS TO GM AND NO ONE COULD GIVE ME ANY ACCURATE INFORMATION. I HAVE NOT BEEN DRIVING MY NEW 2020 CORVETTE VERY OFTEN BECAUSE OF FEAR OF BRAKE FAILURE. I WAS TOLD BY A GM REP THAT IF MODULE DID GO OUT THAT YOUR BRAKES WOULD STILL WORK. HE STATED THAT YOU WOULD JUST HAVE TO USE MORE FOOT PRESSURE ON BRAKES. IT HAS NOW BEEN OVER 90 DAYS AND I AM REQUESTING THAT THIS ISSUE GET RESOLVED FOR ALL NEW CAR OWNERS WHO HAVE THIS RECALL. GM IS TOO LARGE OF A COMPANY TO LET THIS JUST LINGER AS IF ITS NO BIG DEAL.",
