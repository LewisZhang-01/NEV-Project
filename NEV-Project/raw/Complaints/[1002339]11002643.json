THEY \"FIXED\" BOTH PROBLEMS BUT ARE STILL TELLING ME MY PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG WON'T WORK IN AN ACCIDENT WITHOUT ME PAYING $500 FOR THEM TO REPLACE A THIRD PART OF THE AIRBAG SYSTEM. IT IS CLEAR TO ME THIS ENTIRE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG IS FAULTY AND IF THEY ARE MESSING WITH THE LIVES OF THEIR CONSUMERS BY EXTORTING SAFETY FOR MONEY WHEN THEY KNOW THE FLAW IS IN THEIR OWN INSTALLATION/PARTS THEY ARE AN UNETHICAL BRAND. IT SEEMS MORE LIKELY THAT THEY ARE INSISTING ON THIS PURCHASE IN EXCHANGE FOR SAFETY SO THEY CAN MAKE BACK SOME OF THE MONEY THAT THE PREVIOUS RECALLS HAVE COST THEM. EITHER WAY, THE RECALL NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE WHATEVER ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS MIGHT BE DAMAGED DUE TO MAZDA. IT IS NOT FEASIBLE THAT THREE COMPONENTS OF MY PASSENGER SEAT AIRBAG HAVE GONE WRONG IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS BUT THE ONLY TWO UNDER RECALL WERE NOT THE ISSUE. THEY ARE TELLING ME THE CURRENT ISSUE REQUIRES AN REPLACEMENT OF THE ENTIRE AIR BAG MODULE.",
