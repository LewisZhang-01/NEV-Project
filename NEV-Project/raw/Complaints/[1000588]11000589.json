THE DEALERSHIPS THAT I HAVE REACHED OUT TO ARE QUOTING A $400.00 PRICETAG TO \"FIX\" THIS ISSUE THAT IS OBVIOUSLY THE FAULT OF THE MANUFACTURER. IN READING THE FORUMS AND LINKS ON HOW TO FIX THIS, IT HAS BECOME APPARENT THAT KIA REFUSES TO ADDRESS THE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF CONSUMERS WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THIS AND I AM COMPELLED TO REPORT AS HOPEFULLY THE NHTSA CAN COMPEL KIA TO ISSUE A RECALL FOR THIS WIDESPREAD ISSUE AS IT IS INDEED A SAFETY ISSUE.  DOES SOMEBODY HAVE TO DIE TRAPPED IN THEIR KIA FOR KIA TO ADDRESS THIS?",
