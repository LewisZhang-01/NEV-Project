THEY DID A DIAGNOSTIC AND SAID IT WASN'T THE STRUT/ ACTUATOR . HE SAID IT WAS THE MODULE AND THAT IT NEEDED REPLACED WITH AN ESTIMATE OF $750. WE ORDERED THE MODULE AND PUT IT IN AND IT DIDN'T FIX IT. AFTER REPLACING THAT THE TECHNICIAN SAID IT WAS THE MOTOR/LOCK NOT SHOWING ANY POWER, SO WE ORDERED THAT AND IT DIDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM EITHER. LAST WE REPLACED THE STRUT/ACTUATOR AND IT FIXED THE PROBLEM. THE DEALER WON'T ADMIT ANY WRONGDOING BUT WE DON'T FEEL THAT A RECALLED PROBLEM SHOULD HAVE COST US ANYTHING.",
