I IMMEDIATELY LOST ALL VISIBILITY AND WAS UNABLE TO SEE. THE WIPERS NEVER STARTED BACK UP AND I HAD TO TAKE MY CAR TO THE SHOP.  THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT GM HAS A RECALL ON 2013 MODEL (WIPERS/MOTOR) BUT NO OTHERS. THIS IS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY USE THE SAME PART (MOTORS) FOR THE WIPERS IN OTHER MODEL.",
