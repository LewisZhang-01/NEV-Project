SHE STALLED THE CAR IN THE INTERSECTION THEN TRIED TO RESTART BUT THE KEY WAS STUCK. FORTUNATELY A COUPLE NICE GUYS HELPED HER PUSH IT OFF THE ROAD AND I WAS LATER ABLE TO GET THE KEY TO TURN AND GET THE CAR HOME. WHEN I GOT THE CAR HOME IT TOOK ME NEARLY 30 MINUTES TO TURN THE CAR OFF. VW HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FOR SOME TIME BUT THEY REFUSE TO FIX IT. SO I'M SPENDING YET ANOTHER WEEKEND FIXING THIS PIECE OF JUNK. GERMAN ENGINEERING IS JUST ANOTHER WAY TO SAY COLLECTION OF STUPID IDEAS. FOR EXAMPLE THEY TWIST THE HEADS OFF THE BOLTS THAT HOLD THE PROBLEMATIC SWITCH IN DURING MANUFACTURE. NO I'M NOT KIDDING FOLKS.",
