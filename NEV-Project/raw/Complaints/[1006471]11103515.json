        "summary": "WE HAVE A 2017 FORESTER SUBARU 2.5I WITH 12,548 MILES.  THE SUV WILL RANDOMLY JERK, JUMP AND  HAS STALLED IN HWY & CITY TRAFFIC TWICE.   OTHER TIMES IT WILL HESITATE AND SEEM TO SHIFT OUT OF GEAR FOR 30 OR MORE SECONDS. IT SEEMS TO OCCUR WITHIN A COUPLE OF MILES AFTER DRIVING. MOSTLY AFTER  MAKING A TURN.  ALSO WE CAN FEEL HESITATIONS, TRANSMISSION SHIFTING WHEN DRIVING AT SPEEDS OF 40 TO 65 MILES.  THIS HAS BEEN A MINOR PROBLEM THE LAST FOUR MONTHS UNTIL THE SUV STOPPED TWICE IN TRAFFIC.  UNTIL IT STOPPED  IN TRAFFIC  ONLINE RESEARCH \"PROBLEMS WITH 2017 SUBARU\" (PLEASE CHECK THIS OUT)  INDICATES THIS IS A CVS TRANSMISSION PROBLEM.  NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS VERIFY THAT IT IS MOST LIKELY A TRANSMISSION GLITCH . I TOOK THE SUV TO  THE DEALER'S SERVICE DEPT.  THEIR TESTS DID NOT  INDICATE THE PROBLEM.  WE DRIVE OUR GRANDCHILDREN TO NUMEROUS ACTIVITIES. WE WILL NOT DO SO AS WE DO NOT WANT TO RISK THEIR SAFETY,  HAVING THE CAR STOP WHILE DRIVING IN TRAFFIC COULD RESULT IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. WE NO LONGER FEEL SAFE DRIVING THE CAR UNTIL THIS ISSUE CAN BE FOUND.  PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AS IT MAY PUT OTHERS IN HARMS WAY.",
