        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING ON THE TURNPIKE, ALL MY DASH LIGHTS WENT ON, & THE CAR STARTED BUCKING LIKE AN UNBROKEN HORSE AT 70 MILES AN HOUR WHILE I WAS SURROUNDED BY TRACTOR TRAILERS. I MANAGED TO GET HOME BY SWITCHING THE CAR TO MANUAL SHIFTING.  TAKING THE CAR TO THE SUBARU DEALER, I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT:     1. THAT RODENTS HAD EATEN PARTIALLY THROUGH MY SPEED SENSOR WIRE AND IT FINALLY COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED WHILE I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY. THE SPEED SENSOR WIRE IS WHAT TELLS THE TRANSMISSION TO SHIFT.  2. THAT THEY SEE THIS PROBLEM AT LEAST 1 TO 2 TIMES A DAY!!  3. THAT THE SENSOR WIRE IS COATED WITH PEANUT OIL!!!  (ARE YOU KIDDING ME?)  4. THAT IT WAS NOT COVERED UNDER MY 6 YEAR, 600,000 MILE EXTENDED WARRANTY PURCHASED IN ADDITION TO THE VEHICLE.  AND YES, THE WIRE WAS REPLACED WITH THE EXACT SAME WIRE WHICH THEY CANNOT GUARANTEE THIS WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.  THE DEALER'S SOLUTION: MOTHBALLS AROUND MY CAR EVERY TIME I PARK ANYWHERE OR URINATE AROUND MY CAR. HUMANS ARE APPARENTLY THE BEST 'PREDATOR' TO DETER RODENTS.    MY 16 YEAR OLD SON IS LEARNING TO DRIVE & I HAD BEEN TEACHING HIM TO DRIVE ON MY SUBARU BELIEVING IT TO BE THE SAFER OF MY FAMILY'S VEHICLES.  HE WOULD HAVE PANICKED ON THE HIGHWAY IF THAT HAPPENED TO HIM AND SOMEONE WOULD BE HURT, IF NOT DEAD.  AS IT WAS, WITH 20 YEARS PLUS EXPERIENCE DRIVING, IT WAS STILL A SHOCK AND HAD THE TRACTOR TRAILER I PASSED RIGHT BEFORE THE CAR WENT CRAZY NOT BEEN PAYING ATTENTION OR BEEN TIRED, THAT TRUCK WOULD HAVE HIT MY CAR AT 70 MILES AN HOUR.   UNFORTUNATELY, MY 'DAMAGES' FROM THE ORDEAL ARE ONLY MY $100 INSURANCE DEDUCTIBLE AND SOME TIME OFF WORK, SO I DON'T MAKE A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR A SUIT AGAINST SUBARU.  THE CONCERN IS IN WEIGHING COST VERSUS BENEFITS, THE CAR MANUFACTURERS WILL WAIT TO CHANGE ANYTHING UNTIL ENOUGH PEOPLE GET HURT OR DIE TO MAKE IT COST EFFECTIVE TO CHANGE THEIR PRACTICES.   PLEASE DO SOMETHING!",
