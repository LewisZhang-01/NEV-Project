SHE WAS INVOLVED IN A HEAD ON COLLISION AND THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY ON HER 2016 TOYOTA COROLLA. THE BODY SHOP SAID THE CAR SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOTALED BUT DUE TO THE AIRBAGS NOT DEPLOYING, THE INSURANCE COMPANY DID NOT TOTAL THE VEHICLE. I FEEL WE WERE TREATED UNFAIRLY DUE TO THIS. MY DAUGHTER ALSO SUFFERED INJURIES FROM THE INCIDENT.     TWO YEARS LATER WE SEE THERE IS A RECALL FOR THE AIRBAGS.",
