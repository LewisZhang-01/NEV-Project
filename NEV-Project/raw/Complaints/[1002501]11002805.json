I HIT MY BRAKES, TO THE MAXIMUM. I SLID QUIET LONG DISTANCE AND CAME TO A FINAL STOP. I NEARLY HIT THE BIKER, BUT I COULD FEEL THE BRAKES NOT BEING ABLE TO SLOW DOWN THE CAR.   A WEEK AFTER THIS, SAME THING HAPPENED BUT IN A CITY TRAFFIC SIGNAL. I WAS TRYING TO STOP IN A RED LIGHT, BUT AGAIN THE CAR SLID THIS TIME AND THE CAR STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF INTERSECTION. LUCKILY NOBODY WAS IN THE STREET, OTHERWISE BOTH OF THESE INCIDENCES COULD HAVE BEEN A FATAL ACCIDENTS.",
