IT WOULD ALSO HAVE TROUBLE STARTING. WOULDN'T STAY RUNNING. IN SCHOOL PICKUP LINE, CAR WOULD LOOSE ALL POWER AND ENGINE WOULD DIE AS SOON AS GAS PEDDLE WAS PUSHED ON. THIS WOULD HAPPEN ON THE MAIN HIGHWAY, CITY ROADS, SCHOOL PICKUP/ DROP OFF LINE, MAKING TURNS, AND WHEN FIRST STARTING CAR. IT WOULD ALSO DO THESE THINGS WHEN SLOWING DOWN AND ACCELERATING. I HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH THE CAR FOR NEARLY A MONTH, BEFORE THE CAR COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN AND WOULDN'T START. ONE OF THE WIRES CONNECTED TO FUEL PUMP BURNT THROUGH THE HOUSING. WITH THE FUEL PUMP BEING IN THE GAS TANK DON'T YOU THINK THERE COULD HAVE BEEN AN EXPLOSION.",
