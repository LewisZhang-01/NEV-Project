SITUATION 2:  WHEN ON THE THROTTLE, AND YOU LET OFF THE THROTTLE COMPLETELY, AND THEN RAPIDLY GET BACK ON THE THROTTLE; THE ENGINE DOES NOT RESPOND FOR ALMOST 2 SECONDS.  THIS IS *HIGHLY* DANGEROUS, ESPECIALLY WHEN MERGING IN HEAVY TRAFFIC; OR IN AN INSTANCE WHERE SOMEONE MAKES AN UNEXPECTED MOVE (PULLING OUT, CHANGING LANES, ETC) IN FRONT OF YOU AND YOU WANT THE POWER BACK QUICKLY. IT HAPPENS TO ME AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK; AND IT CAN BE CITY OR HIGHWAY, AT ANY SPEED.  THE ONLY TRIGGER IS TO RELEASE THE ACCELERATOR AND THEN STEP RIGHT BACK ON IT, AND YOU WILL BE MISSING POWER FOR A COUPLE SECONDS.",
