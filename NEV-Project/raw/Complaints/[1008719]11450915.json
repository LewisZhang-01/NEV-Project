The sound appears to be coming from inside the engine and is NOT a pulley or slipping belt. There is a lot of discussion about this issue on the web, and Kia has not issued any resolution to any of the customers who have complained and taken to dealers.   This link is not my car but is the same noise - if necessary, I too have my own video I can share.   https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-68J5bocqVxzPLIDpabmgd_St6CMoxky/view  Note: Dealer was able to replicate, and has a video of the issue from us, but has stated that they do not know how to fix.",
