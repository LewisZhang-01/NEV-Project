IT HAS NOW BEEN A YEAR AND A HALF SINCE THE RECALL WAS ANNOUNCED AND EVERY TIME I CALL BMW TO ASK FOR DETAILS THEY SAY THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO. IF BMW CANT PROVIDE REPLACEMENT AIRBAGS FAST ENOUGH TO FIX THEIR CARS THAT ARE DEFECTIVE, THEN THEY NEED TO PROVIDE LOANER CARS OR A BUY-BACK PROGRAM. HAVING TO WAIT 18 MONTHS WITHOUT EVEN GETTING AN UPDATE AS TO WHEN MY CAR WILL EVEN BE FIXED IS RIDICULOUS.",
