        "summary": "While driving along on an interstate highway at night, the frame rate for the display system including speedometer and other vehicle information drastically dropped. This resulted in limited situational awareness of what the car was doing. Updates for lane changing, blind spot detection, and lane departure warnings were delayed/lagged as a result of the reduced frame rate. This did not impact how the vehicle drove, or activation of turn signals, and the lower frame rate did not result in any flickering of the display. A display reset was required while driving at highway speeds to regain full situational awareness.",
