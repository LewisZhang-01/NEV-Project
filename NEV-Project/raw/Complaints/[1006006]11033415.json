APPEARS TO BE ISSUE AFFECTING MANY OTHERS WITH SIMILAR YEARS OF FORD FUSION MODELS, WITH NO IMMEDIATE FIX.  I MYSELF WAS TRAVELING AT 65 MILES PER HOUR ON HIGHWAY WHEN ONE OF THE FIRST INCIDENTS OCCURRED.  I HAD ANOTHER INCIDENT WHERE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR COMING OUT OF MY VENTS WENT FROM AIR CONDITIONED COOL AIR TO EXTREMELY HOT.  WOULDN'T THIS POTENTIALLY CAUSE A LOT OF ACCIDENTS?",
