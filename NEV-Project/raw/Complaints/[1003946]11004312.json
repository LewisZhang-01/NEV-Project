THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE CONTROL WARNING LIGHT CAME ON, AND THEN ALL ELEC POWER WENT OUT. LEAVING THE CAR WITHOUT LIGHTS/FLASHERS. UPON INVESTIGATION, THE ALTERNATOR FAILED, SHORTING OUT THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AND KILLING/DESTROYING THE BATTERY. THE ALTERNATOR SHOULDN'T DO THIS. I FOUND THAT DODGE HAD A RECALL ( P-60) ON THEIR V-6 MODELS FOR THIS VERY SAME ISSUE. MY CAR IS A V-8. I WAS LUCKY I WASN'T DRIVING ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY OR AT NIGHT AS THE CAR HAD NO WAY IOF INDICATING DISTRESS TO OTHER DRIVERS AND THE HEADLIGHTS DIDN'T WORK. THERE IS A CLEAR DEFECT IN THE ALTERNATORS OF THESE CARS, ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE SOMEONE IS INJURED OR KILLED.",
