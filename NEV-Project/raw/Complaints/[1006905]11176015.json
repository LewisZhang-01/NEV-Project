        "summary": "I STARTED FEELING A CLICKING/CLUNKING FEELING IN THE STEERING COLUMN A MONTH AGO, ESPECIALLY WHEN I MADE TURNS. I WAS ALSO ABLE TO FEEL THAT THE STEERING WHEEL HAS STARTED TO GET LOOSER.  ON 2/8/19 TOYOTA RECOMMENDED THAT THE INTERMEDIATE STEERING SHAFT BE REPLACED.  I HAD THIS PART REPLACED FOR $428. THERE'S 58,254 MILES ON THE VEHICLE.   THIS IS MY 3RD TOYOTA VEHICLE IN 30 YEARS AND I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS IN THE PAST. I UNDERSTAND THE NEW SHAFT MAY HAVE AN IMPROVED DESIGN I HOPE SO IT DOES NOT OCCUR AGAIN.  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A RECALL TO REPLACE THIS PART.  DOES THERE NEED TO BE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT OR EVEN SOMEONE GETTING KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF THIS FAULTY  INTERMEDIATE STEERING SHAFT??",
