FIRST INCIDENT OCCURRED WHEN I WAS PULLING INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND RESULTED IN COMPLETE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER. THE SECOND INCIDENT HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY WHILE CHANGING LANES, AGAIN COMPLETE LOSS OF ENGINE POWER AND NEARLY CAUSED ME TO BE HIT BY A SEMI-TRUCK. I NARROWLY ESCAPED AN ACCIDENT IN FIRST INCIDENT AS WELL. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING MY CHILDREN IN THIS CAR ANY LONGER. EACH TIME THE PARTS AND LABOR COST MORE THAN $300, NOT TO MENTION THE AGGRAVATION OF BEING WITHOUT A CAR FOR WORK AND FAMILY TRANSPORTATION FOR SEVERAL DAYS. THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM A QUALITY AUTOMOBILE MADE BY BMW. DOCUMENTATION/INVOICES CAN BE PROVIDED UPON REQUEST.",
