        "summary": "WHEN CHECKING UNDER MY TRUCK FOR A NOISE, MY SON-IN-LAW DISCOVERED THAT THE FRAME ON MY 2005 TOYOTA TACOMA TRUCK WAS RUSTED WITH LARGE HOLES AND PERFORATIONS ON BOTH SIDES IN MULTIPLE PLACES AND ACTUALLY WAS CRUMBLING OFF IN HIS HAND.  I IMMEDIATELY CALLED A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THERE HAD BEEN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ABOUT THE TACOMA FRAMES, BUT IT WAS SETTLED IN MARCH 2016.  I CALLED TOYOTA USA AND WAS TOLD THEY HAD SENT ME A NOTICE ABOUT THE LAWSUIT.  HOWEVER, I NEVER RECEIVED ANYTHING ABOUT THIS NOR DID I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT TOYOTA DOING ANY REPAIRS OR REPLACEMENTS.  I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOT A RECALL ON MY TRUCK.  I HAD A 2001 TOYOTA TACOMA THAT DID HAVE A RECALL ON THE FRAME RUST, BUT MINE DID NOT HAVE ANY PERFORATIONS AND I HAVE SINCE SOLD THAT TRUCK.  I BOUGHT THIS 2005 TRUCK IN 2014 AND HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANY NOTIFICATIONS ABOUT THE FRAME.  I HAVE RECEIVED OTHER RECALL NOTICES WHICH I HAVE HAD REPAIRED AT A DEALERSHIP.  THIS IS A REAL SAFETY PROBLEM.  TOYOTA SAYS THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIKE ME AND THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.   THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR TRUCKS BUCKLE IN HALF.   I AM SUBMITTING PICTURES OF JUST A FEW OF THE SPOTS OF DETERIORATION OF MY FRAME.  I DON'T KNOW WHEN THIS STARTED, BUT WE DISCOVERED IT ON JUNE 11, 2017.  NOW I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE MY TRUCK.",
