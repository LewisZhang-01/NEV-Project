TOOK TO DEALER WHO SAID PUNCTURE OCCURRED WHICH NEVER DID OCCUR. SMALL CRACK IN SIDEWALL LOOKS LIKE DEFECT ON SAME TIRE THAT HAS BEEN RECALLED BY HANKOOK BUT IN A SMALLER SIZE. TIRE IS A 20\" HANKOOK VENTUS S1 NOBLE 2. TIRE APPEARS TO BE DESIGNED FOR SEDAN OR SPORTS CAR BUT WAS OEM TIRE ON FORD EXPLORER SPORT...COULD BE A PROBLEM? DEALER EVENTUALLY REPLACED TIRE WITH SAME WITHOUT ADMITTING IT WAS DEFECTIVE.",
