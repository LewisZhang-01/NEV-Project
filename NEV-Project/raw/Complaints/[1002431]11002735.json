I'VE YET TO GET AN ASSESSMENT AND RETURN DATE. THE DEALERSHIP SEEMS TO NOT BE GETTING INFORMATION FROM THE CORPORATE OFFICE. I CONTACTED THE CORPORATE OFFICE TO ASK WHAT MY OPTIONS WERE. (REFUND, REPLACEMENT, ETC) I TOLD THEM I WAS AWARE OF A \"LEMON LAW\" . THE REP GOT KIND OF SHORT WITH ME, SAID I WOULD BE HEARING FROM THEIR LEGAL DEPT. AFTER 2 WEEKS NO RESPONSE, I CALLED BACK. THEY SAID IT COULD BE 30-45 DAYS BEFORE GETTING A RESPONSE. CONCERNS I HAVE ARE: 1) MY VEHICLE JUST SETTING THERE NOT BEING DRIVEN DEVELOPING MORE PROBLEMS I'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH. 2) A \"BLACK MARK\" ON ITS RESALE VALUE. 3) TOYOTA TRYING TO FORCE ME INTO A \"LOW BALL\" SETTLEMENT. THE DEALER HAS BEEN FAIR AS POSSIBLE SO FAR BUT THEY SEEM TO BE IN A VOID REGARDING THE RECALL FROM THEIR CORPORATE OFFICE. I ALMOST HAVE THE VEHICLE PAID OFF AND NOT LOOKING FORWARD STARTING OVER OR GETTING INVOLVED IN A LEGAL PROCEEDING. ANY ADVICE WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.",
