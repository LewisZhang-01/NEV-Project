THE RH FRONT WHEEL IS SLICED IN HALF.  THE TIRE ON THE RH FRONT WHEEL HAS THE TREAD BADLY WORN AWAY.  THIS IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE NORMAL WEAR PATTERN ON SUCH A RELATIVELY NEW CAR.  IT LOOKS FAR MORE LIKE IT WAS CAUSED BY THE SUSPENSION COLLAPSE FORCING THE WHEEL UP AGAINST THE BODYWORK.  THERE IS A RIDICULOUS NUMBER OF TESLAS SHOWING UP AS SALVAGE WRECKS.  THE INSURERS WOULD PROBABLY PLACE THE BLAME ON TESLA HAVING A MECHANICAL DEFECT.  IT IS MY BELIEF THAT TESLA IS MAKING DEALS WITH THE INSURERS AND OWNERS TO COVER UP THESE PROBLEMS.    PLEASE INVESTIGATE.",
