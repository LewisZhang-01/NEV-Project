I PULLED OVER AND GOT STUCK IN THE FLAMING CAR BECAUSE THE SEAT BELTS WOULD NOT RELEASE. AFTER A WHILE I WAS ABLE TO GET OUT, AND CALL THE FIRE STATION THEY CAME AND OUT THE FIRE; THEY SAID THE WIRE THAT CONNECTS TO THE SPEAKER WAS THE MAIN CAUSES OF THE FIRE. I TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY CLAIMED NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH IT, IT JUST HAPPENED. NOW I'M STUCK WITH A CAR THAT I'M AFRAID TO DRIVE BECAUSE MY LIFE IS NOT ONLY AT RISK OF A CAR ACCIDENT BUT NOW ALSO AN UNKNOWN CAUSE OF ANOTHER POTENTIALLY FIRE.",
