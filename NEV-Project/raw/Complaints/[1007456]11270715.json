        "summary": "MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON WHILE DRIVING.  I TOLD MY CAR TO THE MECHANIC AND I WAS TOLD MY MASS ENGINE AIRFLOW NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  TWO DAYS LATER THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON AGAIN.  RETURN TO THE MECHANIC AND WAS TOLD MY O2 SENSORS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  REPLACED AS RECOMMENDED. I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND THE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN ALONG WITH A MESSAGE THAT SAID REDUCE SPEED.  AT THIS POINT, MY CAR SLOWED DOWN BY ITSELF WHILE I WAS GOING 60 MILES PER HOUR.  I COULD NOT ACCELERATE.  LUCKILY THERE WERE NO CARS BEHIND ME. REVIEWING THE CHEVROLET FORUMS AND IMPALA FORUMS, THIS APPEARS TO BE A KNOWN ISSUE AND GM IS NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT.  READING SOME OF THE STORIES, I CONSIDER MYSELF LUCKY.      AIRBAG THE PASSENGER AIRBAG LIGHT HAS COME ON AND WILL NOT GO OFF.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP, AND THEY TOLD ME THAT IF I AM IN AN ACCIDENT, THE AIRBAG WILL NOT DEPLOY BECAUSE THE CAR ISN'T RECOGNIZING SOMEONE IS IN THE SEAT.  THEY SAID TO ME THAT GM ISSUED A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM; HOWEVER, MY CAR WAS NOT INCLUDED.  I SPOKE WITH A GM REPRESENTATIVE WHO CONFIRMED THE RECALL.  THE GM REPRESENTATIVE SAID ALTHOUGH THE CODE IS SHOWN ON THE DIAGNOSTIC PERFORMED AT THE CERTIFIED DEALER MY VIN WAS NOT COVERED; HOWEVER, THEY OFFERED TO COVER HALF OF MY COST.  HE TOLD ME THAT IF GM EXPANDED THE RECALL TO INCLUDE MY VIN THEN I COULD SEND IN MY RECEIPT FOR A REFUND.",
