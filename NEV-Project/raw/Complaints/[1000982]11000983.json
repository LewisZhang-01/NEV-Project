THE CAR WAS INOPERABLE SO I HAD IT TOWED TO MY HOUSE. 6-24-17 I BEGIN TO INSPECT WHAT HAPPENED, I JACKED THE RT FRT END OFF THE GROUND AND BLOCKED IT UP. I FOUND THE LOWER CONTROL ARM WAS SOMEWHAT LOOSE. IT WAS BROKEN LOOSE FROM THE RT SIDE SUBFRAME. I CAME IN THE HOUSE AND RESEARCHED THE INTERNET AND FOUND THIS WAS A PROBLEM WITH SONATA'S FROM 1999-2004 CAMPAIGN NUMBER 09V12400, I CONTACTED HYUNDAI CUSTOMER SERVICE 6-24-17 AROUND 12:30PM. I GAVE THE CAR INFO TO THE LADY AND SHE SAID ONLY AN A-C RECALL WAS AVAILABLE FOR THE CAR. I ASKED ABOUT THE RECALL AND GAVE THE NUMBER, SHE SAID NOT FOR MY CAR AND THAT WAS ALL THEY COULD OFFER. WHEN THE CONTROL ARM BROKE LOOSE FROM SUBFRAME IT CAUSED THE AXLE TO PULL OUT OF THE DIFFERENTIAL AND THAT WAS WHY IT LOST POWER. I ALSO FOUND THAT THE SUBFRAME IS ALMOST RUSTED THROUGH AND WEAK.",
