I PULLED TO THE SHOULDER AND NOTICED THAT ONE OF THE BRAKE LINES FORWARD OF THE ABS MODULE LOCATED INSIDE THE LEFT FRAME RAIL DIRECTLY BENEATH THE DRIVERS SEAT HAD RUPTURED DUE TO CORROSION. FURTHER INSPECTION SHOWED ALL BRAKE LINES IN THAT AREA WERE COVERED WITH CORROSION. ALL BRAKE LINE WERE REPLACED WITH NEW STAINLESS STEEL LINES AFTER RESEARCHING THAT THIS VERY COMMON PROBLEM WAS NOT AUTHORIZED FOR RECALL. REPAIR COST: $950.00.   IT WOULD APPEAR THAT BRAKE PROBLEMS OF THIS FREQUENCY AND MAGNITUDE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO RECALL AS IT IS APPARENT THAT IT IS A DESIGN FLAW AND VERY DANGEROUS.",
