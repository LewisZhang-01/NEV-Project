        "summary": "WITH 3,000 MILES ON THE MOTORCYCLE THE ENGINE SURGES WHEN TRAVELING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS AND HAD A LOSS OF POWER. UPON RESEARCH, I FOUND SEVERAL ARTICLES DESCRIBING FUEL TANK ISSUES ON THE HONDA AFRICA TWIN ADVENTURE SPORT (ATAS) MODEL. I REMOVED THE FUEL TANK AND FOUND CONTAMINATION IN THE FUEL PUMP AND THE FUEL FILTER. CONTAMINATION CONSISTED OF WHITE FLAKY MATERIAL (LOOKS LIKE DANDRUFF) AND SMALL BITS OF DARK POWDERY METALLIC FLAKES. AN INSPECTION OF THE FUEL TANK REVEALED NO OBVIOUS BREACH OF THE TANK LINER INTEGRITY, HOWEVER THE WELD SEAMS APPEARED TO HAVE A WHITE DISCOLORATION IN THE SEAMS. THE MATERIAL COLLECTED AT THE FUEL PUMP APPEARS TO BE DUE TO LEACHING OF THE WELD SEAMS ON  THE  AFRICA TWIN ADVENTURE SPORTS (ATAS) MODEL.  AFTER I ALLOWED THE FUEL PUMP FILTER TO DRY OUT - I VERIFIED THE DARK POWDERY METALLIC FLAKES WERE FERROUS MATERIAL ( I USED A MAGNET TO VALIDATE FERROUS CONTENT).  MY CALL TO HONDA CORPORATION VERIFIED THERE WAS NO RECALL OR NOTICE REGARDING THIS ISSUE. HONDA CORP. WAS COURTEOUS AND WOULD ONLY RECOMMEND TAKING THE MOTORCYCLE TO A DEALER.  *TR",
