        "summary": "MY ISSUE STARTED WITH MY CAR TURNING OVER. IT WOULD NOT WANT TO START FIRST TRY BUT WOULD TURN OVER ON THE SECOND. SOME TIMES IT WOULD START FINE AND OTHERS IT HESITATED. AFTER DEALING WITH THIS FOR A WHILE MY BATTERY DIED AFTER SPENDING A LITTLE WHILE IDLING. TOOK IT TO CHECK THE ACCELERATOR AND THE BATTERY BUT BOTH WERE FINE. CONTINUING TO INTERMITTENTLY ACT UP WHEN STARTING, IT ALSO STARTED TO SHOW OTHER PROBLEMS. I WAS GETTING IN MY CAR TO LEAVE AND IT STARTED UP FINE BUT BEFORE I COULD PULL OUT OF MY DRIVE WAY MY CAR STARTED SHAKING AND SHOWING AN \"ENGINE POWER IS REDUCED\" MESSAGE. I TURNED IT OFF RAN INSIDE AND WHEN I CAME BACK OUT TO SHOW OTHERS THE ISSUE IT STARTED WITHOUT A PROBLEM AND DID NOT HAVE THE MESSAGE ANY MORE. STILL HAVE THE TURNOVER HESITATION, I CONTINUE TO DRIVE IT HOWEVER IT STARTED TO SHAKE AND SHOW THE SAME ENGINE POWER REDUCED MESSAGE AS I PULLED INTO MY APARTMENT COMPLEX. ALSO HAS DONE THIS WHEN LEAVING AND TURNING INTO A MAIN ROAD, CAUSING US TO PULL OVER AND WAIT TO START IT AGAIN. TOOK IT TO GET CODES TESTED AGAIN AND IT PULLED UP A DIDN'T MATCH CODE. AFTER DOING RESEARCH TONS OF OTHERS HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND WORSE. MANY SHOWED THE SOLUTION TO BE REPLACING THE THROTTLE BODY AND THROTTLE POSITION SENSOR WHICH WE DID. SLIGHT HESITATION ON THE START UP BUT TOOK IT AROUND THE BLOCK NO ISSUES. WENT TO TEST IT ON THE HIGHWAY AND BEFORE WE EVEN MADE IT THE ENGINE POWER REDUCED CAME ON AND CAR SHOOK AGAIN. THERE AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM AND MANY HAVE NOT FOUND THE FIX. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING SINCE WE CANNOT RETURN THE PART AFTER IT'S BEEN INSTALLED. I AM WORRIED TO TAKE MY CAR OUT AND DRIVE IT ON THE HIGHWAY BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT THIS TO HAPPEN WHILE I'M AT INCREASED SPEEDS.",
