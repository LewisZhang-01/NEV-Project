TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP I BOUGHT IT FROM AND I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE STARTER AND THE TORQUE CONVERTER. I HAVE CHANGED THE STARTER 4 TIMES IN SPAN OF 3 YEARS PERIOD I HAVE HAD THE CAR. I HAVE TAKEN IT TO SEVERAL MECHANIC AND EACH OF THEM TELL ME IT'S THE STARTER AND THE FLYWHEEL. TOOK IT TO THE DEALER TO FIX IT AND TOLD THEM ABOUT THE FLYWHEEL ISSUE. THE TECH TOLD ME IT WAS A PROBLEM KNOWN TO 2013-2015 HONDA ACCORD. I ASKED THE DEALERS TO AGREE TO FIXING THE STARTER AND ANY OTHER ISSUES RELATING TO THE STARTER BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT THE ISSUE IS BUT THE REFUSED. I HAVE 2 OF MY COLLEAGUES WITH THE SAME 2014 HONDA ACCORD WITH THE SAME ISSUES. THE ISSUE STARTED 2 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR IN NOVEMBER 2018 AT A HONDA DEALERSHIP.",
