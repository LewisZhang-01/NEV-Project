I IMMEDIATELY APPLIED THE BRAKES TO SLOW DOWN AND THE SHAKING SUBSIDED. THIS HAS HAPPEN ABOUT FIVE TIMES SINCE IT FIRST OCCURRED. I ALSO RECEIVED A RECALL FROM FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES (FCA) STATING THERE WAS A RECALL (V41) WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO FIX THIS ISSUE. WE MADE ARRANGEMENTS AT OUR LOCAL DEALERSHIP TO GET THE RECALL WORK DONE BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE PART ON HAND EVEN AFTER THEY CONFIRMED THEY DID. THAT WAS ON JANUARY 15, 2021. THE DEALERSHIP (THOMPSONS CHRYSLER JEEP IN PLACERVILLE, CA) WAS TO CALL US WHEN THEY RECEIVED THE PART. IT HAD BEEN OVER A MONTH AND A HALF AND WE HAVE NOT HEARD A WORD FROM THEM EVEN AFTER NUMEROUS EMAILS ASKING FOR AN UPDATE.",
