DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE FOR 100 THINGS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH 1 CODE. I'VE OWNED MANY VEHICLES AND I HONESTLY NEVER EXPERIENCED A PROBLEM LIKE THIS.  COSTED ME OVER 10K IN DIAGNOSTICS, PARTS, AND LABOR.  I'M NOT THE ONLY 1 WITH THIS PROBLEM.  VERY UNFAIR.  CADILLAC SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS PROBLEM. THIS ENGINE DESIGN HAS TOO MANY FLAWS!",
