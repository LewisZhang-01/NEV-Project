THE CAR IS IN PARK, BUT THERE MUST BE SOME TYPE OF SENSOR FAILURE.  I AM PROHIBITED FROM COMPLETING SHUT DOWN OF THE VEHICLE UNTIL I CLEAR THE WARNING MESSAGE.  WHEN THIS ISSUE FIRST AROSE, I COULD \"JIGGLE\" THE SHIFTER A BIT, AND THE MESSAGE WOULD CLEAR.  NOW, ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER, I NEED TO START THE CAR, MOVE THE SHIFTER BETWEEN GEARS, AND THEN BACK INTO PARK.  AFTER 2 - 3 TIMES REPEATING THE PROCEDURE, THE WARNING MESSAGE USUALLY CLEARS.  THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN TAKEN IN FOR SERVICE.  A NEW SHIFTER HAS BEEN ORDERED. THE PART IS ON BACK  ORDER.",
