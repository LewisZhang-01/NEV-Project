        "summary": "THE PROBLEM EXPERIENCED WITH MY 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA OCCURS WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION ON STREETS OR HIGHWAYS.  WHILE DRIVING WHEN THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE IS HOT (I.E. >95 DEGREES), THE CAR PERIODICALLY APPEARS TO ENTER INTO \"LIMP MODE\" WHERE POWER IS CUT FROM THE ENGINE AND THE VEHICLE LOSES THE ABILITY TO ACCELERATE. IT IS MY OPINION THAT THE DEFECT IS CAUSED BY HIGH TEMPERATURE WITHIN THE TRANSMISSION (CVT) FLUID AND A SENSOR TRIGGERS A \"LIMP MODE\" TO PROTECT THE TRANSMISSION FROM DAMAGE.  THIS CAUSES AN EXTREMELY UNSAFE CONDITION SINCE I (THE DRIVER) MAY LOSE THE ABILITY TO ACCELERATE IN TRAFFIC (I.E. WHILE MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN) RESULTING IN SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.  MY OWN INTERNET RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH NISSAN (CVT) TRANSMISSIONS AND THE MECHANICAL FIX IS TO INSTALL A TRANSMISSION COOLER.  THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP HAS DRIVEN THE VEHICLE AND STATED THAT THEY CANNOT REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM, THEREFORE THEY HAVE NOT OFFERED A SOLUTION TO THIS UNSAFE CONDITION.",
