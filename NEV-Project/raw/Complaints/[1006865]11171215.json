        "summary": "MY WIFE TRIED TO REMOVE SD CARD SO WE COULD UPDATE MAPS VIA THE INTERNET. THE SD CARD FLEW OUT OF THE DASH, BARELY MISSING HER FACE & IS LOST IN THE FORESTER. 4 PEOPLE SEARCHED FOR MANY HOURS. I CREATED ANOTHER MICRO-SD CARD FROM A COPY OF ITS DATA I SAVE IN 2017 TO GET UPDATES. GPS WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE THE NEW MICRO-SD CARD WITH SUBARU'S DATA. SUBARU MAPS ARE OLD >YEAR LATER. MY WIFE WAS ALMOST INJURED WHEN MICRO-SD CARD WENT MISSING, FLYING PAST HER HEAD. CALLED TO GET REPLACEMENT - >$400 & ALMOST $500. THIS SAFETY ISSUE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. WE NOW HAVE NO GPS THAT COSTS $THOUSANDS WITH A FORESTER PACKAGE (ONLY WAY TO GET GPS). AT A LOSS FOR OLD MAPS & NOW NO MICRO-SD CARD TO EVEN USE GPS WHEN THEIR EQUIPMENT LOST IT, NOT US. CAR WAS IN GARAGE & NOT STARTED. GPS HAS MANY FLAWS & PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW GARMIN & NONO GPSS ARE BETTER - PASSENGER CANNOT MAKE CHANGES OR SET GPS WHEN CAR IS DRIVING (MUST PULL OFF ROAD & STOP TO DO ANYTHING); MAPS ARE VERY OLD (SUBARU INDICATES THEY MAY BE 9 MONTHS OLD WHILE YOU ONLY HAVE LIMITED TIME TO UPDATE); GPS DIRECTS YOU TO WRONG PLACE & DOESN'T EVEN GUIDE YOU HOME WHEN ASKED; CANNOT REQUEST DIRECTIONS TO BUSINESSES, POINTS OF INTEREST & ETC LIKE PORTABLE GPSS; ETC. SAFETY CONCERN IS A REAL ISSUE AS A MICRO-SD CARD MUST NEVER GO FLYING BY A PERSONS FACE OR EVEN DO MORE THAN RELEASE THE SD CARD TO REMOVE IT. SUBARU WILL GLADLY ORDER A NEW SD CAR FOR THE PRICE MENTIONED EVEN THOUGH THEIR EQUIPMENT LOST IT. POOR COMPANY TO TRUST TO DO THE RIGHT THING.",
