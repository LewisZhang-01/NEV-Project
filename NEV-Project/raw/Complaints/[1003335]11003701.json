I LOST ALL POWER STEERING AND NEARLY CRASHED INTO THE DRIVE THRU SIGN. THIS ALL HAPPENED WITHIN MINUTES. WHEN THE STEERING GOES OUT THERE IS NOT ADVANCED INDICATIONS OR WARNINGS UNTIL IT HAPPENS. THE ELECTRIC ASSIST MOTOR IS JUST DISABLED. YOU HAVE NO STEERING AT THAT POINT. IT IS HARDER TO TURN THEN AN OLDER MANUAL STEERING VEHICLE.   THE ENTIRE RACK N PINION STEERING UNIT HAS TO BE REPLACED DUE TO UNDER ENGINEERING. IT IS ONE MOTOR BUT IS EMBEDDED INTO THE RACK. THE COST ALONE IS 1200.00 FOR THE RACK NOT INCLUDING LABOR TO INSTALL AND REPROGRAM.   TO ME THIS IS AN EXTREME SAFETY ISSUE THAT WILL SOME DAY GET SOMEONE SEVERELY INJURED OR DEATH DUE TO A NON STEERING VEHICLE. AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE I HAD JUST DRIVEN OVER A VERY STEEP AND WINDY MOUNTAIN ROAD. SCARY TO THINK WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IF IT HAD FAILED ON THAT ROAD.",
