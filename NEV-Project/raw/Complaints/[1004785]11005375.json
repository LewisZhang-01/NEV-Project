        "summary": "IN 8/2015 WE EXPERIENCED AN OCCURRENCE OF SUDDEN, UNINTENDED ACCELERATION ON A CITY STREET WHILE DRIVING.  MY WIFE WAS ABLE TO STOP THE VEHICLE BY HARD BRAKING AND SHUTTING THE ENGINE OFF.  SHE WAS ABLE TO DRIVE IT HOME AND WE HAD IT TOWED TO THE HYUNDAI DEALER.  THEY DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM: \"...CHECKED AND FOUND VEHICLE THROTTLE BODY TO HAVE A POOR RESPONCE (SIC).\"  THEY REPLACED THE THROTTLE BODY FOR A CHARGE OF $597.94, INFORMING ME THAT IT WASN'T COVERED UNDER THE 10 YEAR/100,000 MILE WARRANTY.  THE PROBLEM RECURRED TODAY (7/14/2015), AGAIN WHILE DRIVING ON A CITY STREET.  WHEN I CALLED THE SERVICE MANAGER TO REPORT THE INCIDENT I WAS TOLD TO DROP THE VEHICLE OFF AND THEY'D LOOK AT IT.  I'LL HAVE IT TOWED IN TO THE SHOP, AS THIS IS NOT A CONDITION WITH WHICH I'D NOT CARE TO DRIVE.  THE FACT THAT THIS CONDITION RECURRED INDICATES THAT THE PROBLEM IS GENERIC IN NATURE, AND THAT HYUNDAI IS NOT CONSIDERING IT EITHER GENERIC OR SERIOUS ENOUGH TO ADDRESS.  I BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE OTHER VEHICLES EXPERIENCING THE ISSUE NOW THAT THE \"FLEET\" OF HYUNDAI SANTA FE SUVS IS AGING BUT STILL IN SERVICE.    I BELIEVE THAT IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT HYUNDAI ADDRESS THE ISSUE SYSTEMATICALLY BEFORE SERIOUS INJURIES OCCUR.",
