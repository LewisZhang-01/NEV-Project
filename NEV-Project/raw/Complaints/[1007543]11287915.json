WHEN I WENT OVER THE CHANGE IN ELEVATION THE TRUCK'S FRONT END SHOOK VIOLENTLY, THE STEERING WHEEL SHOOK SO HARD IT WAS HARD TO HOLD ONTO, I SLOWED DOWN THE TRUCK TO 10 MPH AND THE SHAKING WENT DOWN.  THIS WAS EXTREMELY SCAREY AND DANGEROUS, LUCKILY NO ONE WAS BEHIND ME ON THE HIGHWAY AND THE WEATHER WAS NOT BAD.  THIS TRUCK ONLY HAS 20,000 MILES ON IT.  I REALLY WISH THERE WAS A RECALL REGARDING THIS TRUCK, I WANT TO TRADE IT IN AT THIS POINT, IT'S TOO SCAREY TO DRIVE.",
