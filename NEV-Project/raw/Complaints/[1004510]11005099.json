MY BRAKES ARE GETTING GREASE ON THEM. THIS IS AN OBVIOUS SAFETY HAZARD. SEARCHING ON THE INTERNET - THE WEB IS FULL OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME ISSUES. THE MANUFACTURER, SO FAR, IS AVOIDING RESPONSIBILITY WITH A LIST OF BS EXCUSES ABOUT OWNERS DOING THEIR OWN MAINTENANCE ETC. BRAKES, BEARINGS, AXLES, BACKING PLATES, SHOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE ON A NEARLY NEW TRAILER WITH LOW MILES AND JUST NOW GETTING IT'S FIRST MAINTENANCE. IN THE WORDS OF MY SERVICE MANAGER \"THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE\". SO WHY IS LIPPERT OR GRAND DESIGN NOT DOING THE RESPONSIBLE THING??",
