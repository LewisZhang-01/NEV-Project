I PUT MY VEHICLE IN PARK WALKED AROUND MY CAR DOOR WALKED BY THE FRONT OF MY TRUCK TO RETRIEVE THE PACKAGE AND ALL THE SUDDEN I WAS KNOCKED DOWN. I DID NOT REALIZE WHAT HAPPENED UNTIL I LOOKED UP AND SAW MY TRUCK DRIVING TOWARDS ME. I SCREAM FOR HELP AS I CRAWLED BACKWARDS TO SAFETY. A FEW MINUTES LATER I REALIZE THE TRUCK WAS NO LONGER MOVING AND BY THE GRACE OF GOD MY WHEELS WERE TURNED SLIGHTLY AND IT HAD STOPPED BECAUSE IT HIT THE SIDE OF MY HOUSE. IT TOOK A COUPLE OF DAYS FOR THE SHOCK TO WEAR OFF OF WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME OR MY KIDS IF THEY WERE PLAYING OUTSIDE. MY HUSBAND AND I SPOKE TO A COUPLE OF PEOPLE INCLUDING A CERTIFIED MECHANIC AND WE FOUND OUT THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE ON THE 2015 YUKONS. I AM ATTACHING PICTURES OF WHAT WE FOUND FROM GMC ALONG WITH MY TRUCK.",
