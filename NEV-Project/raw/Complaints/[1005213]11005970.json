AS SPEED INCREASES, THE STEERING GETS HEAVIER (AS IT SHOULD) BUT DEVELOPS A \"DETENT\" AT STRAIGHT CENTER. THE FASTER THE SPEED, THE MORE EFFORT NEEDED TO OVERCOME THE DETENT RESISTANCE, TO THE POINT THAT IT BECOMES EASY TO OVERSTEER THE CAR. THIS CAN BE REAL SCARY DURING AVOIDANCE MANEUVERS AND QUICK LANE CHANGES.",
