        "summary": "E - C V V T SEAL SEATING ISSUE. MY 2016 KIA OPTIMA IS GIVING AN OBD II ERROR CODE OF P0010 \"A\" CAMSHAFT POSITION ACTUATOR CIRCUIT. THIS CAUSES REDUCTION IN POWER DURING ACCELERATION, AND ELEVATES ENGINE IDLE SPEEDS TO 1200-1400 RPM. THIS ELEVATION IN ENGINE SPEED CAUSES THE CAR TO TRY TO MOVE FORWARD EVEN WHEN THE BRAKES ARE PRESSED IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC. IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC, THIS COULD EASILY LEAD TO VEHICLE CRASHING. THIS, I BELIEVE, SHOULD BE A PART OF RECALL INSTEAD OF A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN FROM THE MANUFACTURER. HYUNDAI AND KIA USE SAME ENGINE, AND HAS A TSB NUMBER 15-01-022-1, AND KIA HAS A TSB TO CHANGE THE MOTOR PLUG AND ECVVT COVER FOR IT. THEY ARE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE IN THEIR CAR, AND IT SHOULD BE A RECALL. WHEN THE CAR WAS IN MOTION FOR ME THE FIRST TIME THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, I ALMOST HIT A CAR IN FRONT OF ME AS THE ENGINE DOES NOT GO BACK DOWN TO IDLE SPEEDS. THIS IS DANGEROUS.",
