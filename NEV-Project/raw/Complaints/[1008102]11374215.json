THE TRUCK WAS SOLD WITH TECHNICAL PROBLEMS OF THE BACKUP CAMERA, THAT TOTALLY DOESN&#8217;T  WORK TILL NOW. THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS STARTS ON 07 TH OF OCTOBER 2020, WHEN I NOTICED A HUGE NOISE  IN THE CAR ACCORDING TO THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM. ON THE 08 TH OF OCTOBER 2020, I HAVE BEEN  TO DEALERSHIP LOCATED AT 8445 45 TH ST LYONS, IL, 60534, AND I LEFT THE CAR AT THEIR SERVICE  CENTER TO DIAGNOSE THE TECHNICAL PROBLEM AND FOR SURE TO SOLVE IT. DURING ONE WEEK THEY  CAN&#8217;T DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. AFTER THAT, THEY CALLED ME, AND SAID THAT THE PROBLEM WAS  DIAGNOSED BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY DIDN&#8217;T HAVE THE NECESSARY SPARE PARTS, BECAUSE THE  FORD MOTOR COMPANY DOESN&#8217;T PRODUCE MORE THIS KIND OF SPARE PARTS. BUT HOW IT&#8217;S  POSSIBLE TO SELL THE CARS WITHOUT NECESSARIES SPARE PARTS, WHAT HAVE TO DO THE  CONSUMER IF THE CAR IS A NEW ONE AND IT BRAKES?  THEY DIDN&#8217;T REPAIR THE TRUCK IN 30 DAYS; I CALLED THE FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE, BUT THE MS AT THE PHONE TOLD ME THAT THEY CAN&#8217;T SOLVE  SUCH KIND OF PROBLEMS, AND I HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER DEALERSHIP WHO CAN REPAIRS THE TRUCK.  ACCORDING TO THE LAW THEY HAVE TO REPAIR THE CAR IN 30 DAYS, AND THEY DIDN&#8217;T, THE CAR  IT&#8217;S WORSE THEN IT WAS BEFORE.  AND NOW I DON&#8217;T KNOW WHAT TO DO, WHY THE CAR NEW WARRANTY DOESN&#8217;T WORK, THE ADDITIONAL  PREMIUM CARE WARRANTY DOESN&#8217;T WORK. AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE TRUCK IS A NEW ONE, WITH  58 000 MILES. I PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR THIS CAR, AND NOW I&#8217;M IN THE SITUATION THAT I HAVE TO  PAY THE CREDIT RATE AND I HAVE NO POSSIBILITY TO DO IT, BECAUSE THE TRUCK IS BROKEN AND I CAN&#8217;T  WORK. NOW I DROVE THE TRUCK TO ANOTHER SERVICE (NOT FORD) WHERE I WAS TOLD THE COST OF THE REPAIR WOULD COST  $7.000. THEY SAID THAT I CANNOT DRIVE THE TRUCK NOW BECAUSE IT IS DANGEROUS.",
