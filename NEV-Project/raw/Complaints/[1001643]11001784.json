RUINED TWO FRONT TIRES (WHICH LUCKILY DIDN'T BURST ON ME ON THE HIGHWAY), RUINED SECOND SET OF FRONT TIRES. AGAIN, TIRES WERE BRAND NEW IN 2015 DUE TO THE LEFT CONTROL ARM, HAVE REPLACED 4 TIRES SINCE THEN DUE TO THE FRONT CONTROL ARMS. CHRYSLER WON'T DO ANYTHING. THERE ARE A MILLION COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ON THE PATRIOT MODEL ONLINE. JEEP DEALERSHIP SERVICE CENTER AND TWO MECHANICS TOLD ME IT WAS A DESIGN FLAW AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. LOOKING AT $750-$1500 A YEAR (NOT TO MENTION THE COST OF NEW TIRES) TO CORRECT. SILLY. CAR HAS NEVER BEEN IN 4X4 OR OFF ROAD. HAS 74K MILES ON IT AND IS 6 YEARS OLD. GIVEN THAT THE TIRES HAVE STEEL POKING THROUGH W/IN A YEARS TIME DUE TO THE CONTROL ARM, THIS IS DANGEROUS!",
