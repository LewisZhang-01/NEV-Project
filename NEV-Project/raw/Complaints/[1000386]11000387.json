        "summary": "2011 SONATA, CAR BURNS OIL TO BLACK IMMEDIATELY. TOOK CAR IN ON WARRANTY SERVICE FOR FRONT KNOCKING NOISE THAT APPEARED TO GENERATE FROM STEERING WHEEL. REPLACED LEFT TRANSAXLE, STILL NOISE TOOK IT BACK THEY REPLACED RIGHT TRANSAXLE. THE ISSUES WITH ELECTRICAL STILL EXIST THEY'VE REPLACED THE LEFT SIDE BUTTONS ON STEERING WHEEL EVEN THOUGH I COMPLAINED NONE WORKED CORRECTLY. NOW CRUISE CONTROL IS NONEXISTENT. THE AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON AT 73000 MILES. SEAT DOESN'T GO ALL THE WAY DOWN. THERE IS A DEFINITIVE RATTLE ORIGINATING FROM THE ENGINE AND AT TIMES THE REAR END SEEMS TO HAVE DRAG AND SHAKE. THEY INSPECTED CAR FOR RECALL AND OF COURSE THEY SAID MY VEHICLE IS UNAFFECTED BUT WHO KNOWS HOW THOROUGH THEIR INSPECTION ACTUALLY IS. I MEAN THEY REPRESENT HYUNDAI SO WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO SAY IT WAS BAD PRIOR TO ANY BREAKDOWN. RIGHT. I FEEL LIKE THIS SEVERE OF AN ISSUE SHOULD HAVE AN INDEPENDENT INSPECTION.",
