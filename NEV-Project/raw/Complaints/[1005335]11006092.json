WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE, AND HAD THE AIR CONDITIONING ON. WHEN ACCELERATING, THE BLOWER CUT OFF AND I COULD ONLY FEEL THE AIR SLIGHTLY COMING FROM THE AC VENT. HAD IT DIAGNOSED AT MY MECHANIC AND HE INDICATED THAT HE'D SEEN THIS MANY TIMES IN CHEVYS AND THAT THERE HAD TO BE SOME DEFECT IN THE BLOWER MOTOR FOR IT TO PULL SO MUCH AMPERAGE -- ENOUGH TO MELT THE WIRING HARNESS, WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY BLEW THE RESISTOR.",
