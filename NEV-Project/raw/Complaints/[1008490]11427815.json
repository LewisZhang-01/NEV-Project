        "summary": "Basically I was driving and stopped and my house and while in ideal the wiring under the hood and under the fender into the dash all started to melt together shorting the systems so I tried to repair and replace the parts due to being a used vehicle and didn't know how to report this until now. So I cut the melted chunk of wiring harnesses out and trashed it. But I stopped due to the inability to find any replacement harnesses from Ford or mercury so now my car has been sitting for several months. I have only been able to find melted harnesses on junk yard cars. Ford used poor quality 16 gauge wiring that the outer coating became brittle and easily frayed. Every wiring harness I've seen has bad spots from wires melting or breaking and corroding. I'm my case the wiring melted causing the cooling system to stop working properly and almost damaged or may have damaged my engine. I don't have full coverage so I am forced to park it and do what I can myself which has made me lose my job and ruined my life. Please do look into this I'm sure more people have the same issue just check a junk yard and you'll see what I mean. Thank you for your time I will try to provide any further information or help if needed anyway I can to make sure someone doesn't get hurt.",
