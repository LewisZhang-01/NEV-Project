EVERY TIME MY CELLPHONE RINGS, IT'S EAR PIERCINGLY LOUD. IT MAKES ONE JUMP LOUD. I DID TRY TO GET HELP AT THE DEALERSHIP BUT SADLY THERE IS NO REMEDY.   THE PROBLEM IS TWOFOLD:     1. THE PHONE CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH TO THE CAR'S NATIVE SYSTEM. WHILE IN SETTINGS THERE IS A MODE WHERE ONE IS ABLE TO ADJUST THE RING VOLUME (WHICH IS FOR SOME REASON SET TO '10' BY DEFAULT) AND BRING IT DOWN TO '1-2', SOON AS ONE PARKS AND LEAVES THE CAR FOR EVEN AN HOUR THE SYSTEM RESETS TO '10'. EVEN WORST, SOMETIMES ALL ONE HAVE TO DO WITHOUT LEAVING THE VEHICLE, TO TURN UP THE VOLUME ON THE RADIO AND THAT WILL RESET THE PREVIOUSLY LOWERED RING VOLUME.     2. THE PHONE CONNECTED TO AIRPLAY FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO SETTINGS WHATSOEVER. EVEN IF THE PHONE IN SILENT MODE AND THERE IS NO SOUND FOR TEXT MESSAGES, IT RINGS OVERWHELMINGLY LOUD.",
