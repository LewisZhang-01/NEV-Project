THE CONTROL ARM ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WAS RUSTED AND SNAPPED SNAPPED WHILE MY CAR WAS TRAVELING STRAIGHT. MY CAR IS AFFECTED BY THE WVX34 FRONT LOWER CONTROL ARM (TRANSVERSE LINK) CORROSION RECALL, WHICH WAS PERFORMED BEFORE I PURCHASED THE CAR. THE CONTROL ARMS HAD ANTI-RUST SPRAY APPLIED AT THAT TIME, AND WERE NOT REPLACED. THE SPRAY WAS NOT EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING FURTHER DAMAGE. FORTUNATELY I WAS UNHARMED BECAUSE THE HIGHWAY WAS NOT VERY BUSY AND TRAFFIC WAS MINIMAL.",
