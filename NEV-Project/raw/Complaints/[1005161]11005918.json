I FIRST BECAME AWARE OF THE ISSUE AS THE CAR WAS DRIVING ON A CITY STREET, WHERE I HEARD A LOUD BANG IN THE BACK RIGHT OF THE CAR, AND THE NOISE CONTINUED AS THE CAR WENT OVER BUMPS. IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THE DAMAGE THE RUST WAS CAUSING TO THE AREA UNTIL THE SHOCK MOUNT CAME FREE, AS THE SEALANT USED IN THE WHEEL WELL HID THE DAMAGE-- APPROXIMATELY EVERY 3-6 MONTHS I EXAMINE THE CAR FOR RUST AND NOTICED NO EXTREME DAMAGE TO THIS AREA PREVIOUSLY.",
