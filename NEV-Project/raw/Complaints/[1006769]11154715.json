        "summary": "WHILE TRAVELING AT LOW SPEEDS, ESPECIALLY WHEN MAKING TURNS/ COMING OUT OF PARKING LOTS, OUR CHRYSLER PACIFICA WILL STALL. IT DOES A HARD SHIFT AND JOLTS FORWARD, AS IF A GEAR HAS SLIPPED OR WE HAVE BEEN REAR-ENDED.     THE FIRST TIME WE TOOK IT IN FOR THIS ISSUE WAS IN SEPTEMBER OF 2017 WHEN THE CAR HAD ABOUT 32,000 MILES. NUMEROUS 'SOFTWARE UPDATES' HAVE BEEN DONE AND A VALVE THROTTLE BODY WAS PUT ON IN JUNE 2018 TO TRY AND RESOLVE THE ISSUE AFTER MANY FORMER ATTEMPTS. IT WORKED FOR A COUPLE MONTHS, BUT NOW WE ARE EXPERIENCING THE STALL/ HARD SHIFT AGAIN. CHRYSLER'S CUSTOMER CARE HAS BLANTANTLY DENIED ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO SUPERVISORS AND POINTS THE FINGER AT THE DEALERSHIP, WHILE THEY POINT FINGERS AR CHRYSLER. THE CAR IS 2 YEARS OLD AND DOESN'T GIVE ME ANY HOPE OF EVER REALLY BEING FIXED. WE HAVE BEEN METICULOUS ABOUT MAINTENANCE AND HAVE ONLY TAKEN IT TO CERTIFIED CHRYSLER DEALERSHIPS. OUR FIRST FAMILY CAR PURCHASED TOGETHER HAS BEEN AN EXPERIENCE WE DON'T WANT OTHERS TO GO THROUGH. CHRYSLER IS NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR PRODUCING UNSAFE VEHICLES.",
