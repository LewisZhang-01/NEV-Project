        "summary": "WHILE TRAVELING AT FULL SPEED, THE DIESEL ENGINE STUMBLED, THE GLOW PLUG LIGHT ILLUMINATED, THEN BOGGED TO A STOP ALONG THE SIDE OF THE ROAD IN TRAFFIC.  TOWED TO DEALER WHO SAID ALL DIESEL COMPONENTS EXCEPT THE FUEL TANK INCLUDING ALL THE HOSES AND TUBING WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE THE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP FAILED SENT METAL SHAVINGS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM. CAR HAS 98K MILES AND HAS NOT YET HAD ANY DIESEL FIX INSTALLED AS PART OF THE DIESEL SCANDAL. WAS GOING TO HOLD ONTO CAR FOR A SHORT TIME LONGER THEN SELL BACK TO VW. BOY, WHAT A COSTLY MISTAKE BECAUSE THE CAR MUST BE RUNNING TO RETURN IT. NOT HAPPY WITH VW FOR THIS AND A HANDFUL OF OTHER SERIOUS FAILURES AND ILLEGAL (AND QUITE FRANKLY, SHOCKINGLY BRAZEN) BEHAVIORS THIS COMPANY HAS DEMONSTRATED. MY ADVICE IF YOU STILL HAVE A TDI, DON'T WAIT, TURN IT IN NOW.  MY ADVICE FOR FUTURE VAG (VW/AUDI/PORSCHE) BUYERS, THESE VEHICLES ARE NOT WELL DESIGNED FOR RELIABILITY AND ARE VERY EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN. FURTHERMORE, VAG HAS PROVEN ITSELF TO PUT PROFITS ABOVE ALL ELSE INCLUDING YOUR SAFETY AND WITH COMPLYING WITH LAWS.  BEST TO BUY SOMETHING ELSE AND LET THIS DISHONEST COMPANY SUFFER UNTIL IT REALIZES IT MUST DO BETTER. IF YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE ONE OF THE PRODUCTS OF THIS DISHONEST COMPANY, BE SURE TO NEVER LET THE WARRANTY EXPIRE AS LONG AS YOU OWN IT BECAUSE ODDS ARE YOU WILL NEED IT OVER AND OVER TO COVER THE FREQUENT AND EXPENSIVE REPAIRS...THE DIESEL FUEL EFFICIENCY WILL NEVER PAY BACK DUE TO THE FREQUENT REPAIR COSTS.",
