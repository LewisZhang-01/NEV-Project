ONCE IN A PARKING SPOT, AND ONCE WHEN I APPROACHED A BUSY INTERSECTION ON A COLLEGE CAMPUS.  THE CAR WOULD NOT STOP.  IT MADE A GRIND G NOISE, SKIED AND JUST WOULD NOT STOP.  I HAD TO THROW THE CAR OUT OF DRIVE TO GET IT TO STOP.  THE DEALERSHIP PLILIPS CHEVROLET IS SAYING THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS DID NOT DETECT A PROBLEM. S I JUST IMAGINED THE TERRIFYING ORDEALS THAT I ENCOUNTERED.  I NOW HAVE TO GO BACK AND GET THIS CAR AND DRIVE IT BRILL IT HAPPENS AGAIN.  THE WEATHER IS ABOUT TO GET BAD SO WHAT IF IT HAPPENS AND PUTTING THE CAR IN DRIVE DOES NOT STOP IT.  I'M TOTALLY SCARED TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE.",
