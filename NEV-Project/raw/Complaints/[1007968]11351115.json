THE CONTACT TOOK THE VEHICLE TO HUGHES SUBARU (3010 ATLANTA HWY, ATHENS, GA 30606) TO HAVE THE BRAKES INSPECTED AND THE DEALER FOUND NO FAULTS WITH THE BRAKES. AS THE FAILURE PERSISTED, THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE SAME DEALER WHERE THEY DISCOVERED A FAILURE WITH THE TWO FRONT TIRE WHEEL BEARINGS AND THEY REPLACED THE TWO FRONT BEARINGS UNDER WARRANTY. THE DEALER ALSO SUGGESTED THAT ALL FOUR TIRES WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED DUE TO THE WHEEL BEARINGS. THE CONTACT THEN TOOK THE VEHICLE TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC WHERE HE INSPECTED THE VEHICLE AND DISCOVERED THAT ALL FOUR TIRES WERE CHOPPED. HE STATED THAT THE TWO FRONT TIRES WERE WORSE THEN THE REAR TIRES. THE INDEPENDENT MECHANIC ALSO MENTIONED THAT THE FAILURE COULD LEAD TO SUSPENSION ISSUES. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS APPROXIMATELY 26,000. *DT    CONSUMER TOOK VEHICLE BACK TO HUGHES SUBARU TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT THE CHOPPED TIRES AND POTENTIAL SUSPENSION ISSUES. THE SERVICE MANAGER SAID THAT THE CHOPPING ON THE TIRES WERE NOT A RESULT OF FAILURE OF THE WHEEL BEARING HUBS. HE ALSO SAID THAT THERE WOULD BE NO SUSPENSION ISSUES BECAUSE OF THE FAILURE. HE SAID THAT THE TIRES DID NOT NEED TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE THERE WAS 6+ TREAD STILL REMAINING ON THE TIRES. *DL",
