ON THE THIRD YEAR IT DIED AND WAS REPLACED WITH A AAA BATTERY. AFTER 6 MONTHS THIS BATTERY IS ALSO SHOWING CORROSION. THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON ISSUE AFTER DOING GOOGLE SEARCHES. WHAT'S WORSE IS THE POSITIVE BATTER CABLE IS NOT AN EASY NOR ECONOMICAL REPLACEMENT ONCE THE CORROSION FINDS ITS WAY INSIDE. I BELIEVE THE CORROSION IS HAPPENING BECAUSE OF THE 'SMART CHARGING SYSTEM' HONDA IS USING ON THIS VEHICLE. NEVER SEEN THIS PROBLEM IN MY 30+ YRS OF OWNING DOZENS OF CARS.",
