BASED ON THE FACT THAT MILEAGE SEEMS TO BE LOW FOR AN ALTERNATOR FAILURE (44K) AND SAME ENGINE HAD SIMILAR ISSUES, I QUESTION WHY MY JEEP ISN'T COVERED IN THE RECALL OR IF THE RECALL SHOULD/NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED.  WE WERE PARKED WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING.  WHEN I SHIFTED THE CAR IN REVERSE, THE LOW VOLTAGE LIGHT CAME ON, THE ALTERNATOR QUIT WORKING AND ENDED UP DESTROYING THE DRIVE BELT.  THERE WAS SMOKE COMING FROM THE ALTERNATOR AND I WAS CONCERNED OF POSSIBLE FIRE.",
