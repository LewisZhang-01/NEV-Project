I HAVE TAKEN IT TO 3 DIFFERENT MECHANICS, MOST RECENTLY THE DEALERSHIP. ONE OF MY MECHANICS INITIALLY TOLD ME THEY THOUGHT IT WAS THE TIPM AND THAT CHRYSLER HAS A KNOWN ISSUE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM BUT HAVE NOT RECALLED IT OR FIXED THE ISSUE. MY CAR ALSO AT TIMES DOES NOT CRANK PROPERLY. I INSERT THE KEY AND TURN IT TO THE RIGHT AND HOLD IT AS IF I AM STARTING THE CAR. SILENCE AND NOTHING HAPPENS FOR ABOUT 10 SECONDS AND THEN IT FINALLY CRANKS UP. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AS I HAVE ONLY ONE VEHICLE AND 2 KIDS THAT I DRIVE TO AND FROM SCHOOL EVERY DAY. I AM ALWAYS IN PANIC MODE WHEN DRIVING THE CAR. I AM ALWAYS SCARED BECAUSE I KNOW IT CAN SHUT OFF AT ANY GIVEN TIME.",
