I OPENED THE DRIVER DOOR TO START THE VEHICLE AND NOTICED THAT THERE WAS FROST ON THE BOTTOM HALF INSIDE OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AS WELL. ALL OTHER WINDOWS AND DOORS HAD BEEN CLOSED. I STARTED THE VEHICLE UP TO BEGIN DEFROSTING THE WINDSHIELD AND SCRAPED THE OUTSIDE FRONT WINDSHIELD. UPON COMPLETING THIS, THE FROST ON THE INSIDE WAS STILL THERE BUT SLOWLY MELTING AWAY FROM THE HEATER.   WE HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE FOR 20 DAYS AND IT HAD 6,350 MILES WHEN PURCHASED. CURRENTLY HAS 6,940 MILES WHEN THIS DEFECT HAPPENED.",
