ALSO I HAVE A STARTING PROBLEM THE CAR STALLS AND WON'T START UNLESS I PUT IT IN NEUTRAL OR JIGGLE THE GEAR UP INTO DRIVE AND BACK INTO PARK. THE CAR TURNS VERY SLOWLY WHEN MAKING LEFT HAND TURNS AND THE ENGINE REVS UP SOMETIMES WHEN IT'S TRYING TO PICK SPEED BACK UP AFTER A TURN. THE DEALER TOLD US IT WAS THE BATTERY AND WE HAD THEM INSTALL A NEW ONE BUT THE ISSUE IS STILL THERE. I'VE READ SEVERAL COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE. CUSTOMERS GETTING THEIR BATTER, STARTERS ALL THE RECALLS UPDATED BECAUSE THEY WERE TOLD THOSE WERE THE ISSUES BUT WAS NOT AS THEIR ISSUE STILL EXISTED AS DO MINE. I DON'T WANT TO SPEND A FORTUNE AT THE DEALER UNTIL THEY FIND WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS FROM ALL THE COMPLAINTS BEING THE SAME. I EMAILED THEM FOR SUGGESTIONS OF WHAT THEY THINK IT MAY BE AND THEY JUST SAID TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP.",
