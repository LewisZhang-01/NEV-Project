WEEKS LATER, I'M DRIVING DOWN THE STREET AND GET A WARNING FOLLOWED BY LOSS OF POWER STEERING WHEN EXITING AND MAKING A TURN.  CONTACTED A FORD DEALER, GAVE MY VIN#, ONLY TO FIND OUT THERE IS NO RECALL ON THIS, THAT IT HAS BEEN \"RESET\", AND THAT TO HAVE IT FIXED, I WILL HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET.  WHY HASN'T FORD RECALLED THIS ISSUE?  IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS TO LOOSE POWER STEERING WHILE DRIVING!!",
