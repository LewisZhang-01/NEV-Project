IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO TURN RIGHT AT EXIT 40 AND TO CHANGE DIRECTION.  JUST LIKE THE STEERING WAS LOCKED.  I JUST BARELY COULD TURN INTO THE PARKING SPACE CLOSE TO THAT EXIT.  I AM DRIVING THIS CAR EVERY DAY FOR ONE HOUR IN THE MORNING, AND ONE HOUR OR MORE IN THE AFTERNOON, I'M SCARE THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN WHILE I'M DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY (85 ATLANTA) OR IN A LOT OF TRAFFIC.  I AM SO AFRAID OF DRIVING THIS CAR.  PLEASE, HELP ME!!  DO WE HAVE A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM?  I THINK THAT TOYOTA COROLLA STEERING PROBLEMS MAY LEAD TO ANOTHER RECALL. WHAT ARE THEY WAITING FOR?",
