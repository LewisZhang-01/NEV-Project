        "summary": "This is the second cracked windshield on our new Subaru Forester in the past four months. We purchased the car new just over six months ago (12/29/2020).  The first time, the windshield cracked, something hit the windshield while driving.  The crack was extensive and we paid to replace the windshield on 3/22/2021. The second time something hit the windshield while driving (on 6/8/2021), it just chipped the windshield, and since the chip was a small star, less than the size of a quarter, we had the chip repaired to prevent further damage (on 6/10/2021).  Today (7/4/2021), the windshield cracked while the car was parked in the driveway.  The crack extends from the original chip.  Since an intact windshield is critical to the safety of the vehicle, we will replace the windshield again.  See attached photos and receipts.  It is disappointing to have to replace the windshield twice within the first seven months we have owned the car.  This seemed so unusual, I searched online to see if other Subaru owners have had similar problems.  There is evidence that this has happened to others as well, so this may be a bigger issue.
