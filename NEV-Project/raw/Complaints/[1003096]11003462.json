HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO ACCEPT THE RENTAL CAR, I MUST AGREE NOT TO DRIVE MY OWN CAR AT ALL EVEN WHEN I AM ALONE.  I EXPLAIN I AM ALONE 99.9% OF THE TIME BUT HAVE CHILDREN AND OTHER GUESTS COMING TO VISIT ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS THIS SUMMER AND THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY TIME I WOULD HAVE FRONT SEAT PASSENGERS AND THE ONLY TIME I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE MY CAR IN ITS CURRENT CONDITION. I AM TOLD BY DEALER'S REPRESENTATIVE I MUST SIGN DOCUMENTS STATING I WILL NOT DRIVE MY CAR AT ALL ONCE I AM GIVEN A RENTAL.  I AM ALSO TOLD DEALER MAY NOT BE EQUIPPED TO REPAIR/CORRECT THE PROBLEM UNTIL SOME TIME LATE FALL 2017, WHICH MEANS I WILL HAVE TO DRIVE A RENTAL FOR 5 OR 6 MONTHS WHILE MY OWN CAR SITS IDLY.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY I CAN'T DRIVE MY OWN CAR WHEN I AM ALONE AND WHY I MUST 'COMMIT' TO A RENTAL FOR THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF TIME.  THEY WILL NOT OFFER ME THE SAME TYPE OF CAR EITHER.",
