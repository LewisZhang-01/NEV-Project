HAS NEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN A COLLISION, OR BEEN OFF-ROAD OR RAN OVER OR HIT ANYTHING OTHER THAN DIPS AND BUMPS THAT MY TOYOTA YARIUS AND HONDA FIT HAVE RAN OVER WITH NO PROBLEMS.  THE RIGHT FRONT TIRE HAS WORN OUT TWICE AND CHRYSLER SAYS IT IS BECAUSE I DID NOT ROTATE TIRES EVERY 5,000 MILES.  VEHICLE HAS BEEN TO THE DEALER FOR SERVICE SEVERAL TIMES AND I WAS NEVER INFORMED ABOUT THIS PROBLEM EITHER DURING SERVICE OR WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE.  I BELIEVE THIS IS A FLAW THAT CHRYSLER IS PRETENDING DOES NOT EXIST.",
