THEREFORE THE VEHICLE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT GEAR IT NEEDS TO BE IN. AFTER HAVING RERESEARCHED ONLINE THIS IS A KNOW, COMMON ISSUE. THIS IS A SERIOUS DANGER AS THE VEHICLE GOES INTO \"LIMP\" MODE; (WON'T PROPERLY ACCELERATE). THIS CAN HAPPEN UNDER MANY DRIVING CONDITIONS, CITY OR HIGHWAY. IMAGINE ENTERING TRAFFIC AT A BUSY INTERSECTION AND SUDDENLY LOSING THE ABILITY TO ACCELERATE. I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS, AS HAVE MANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS ACCORDING TO INTERNET RESEARCH. IT SEEMS THAT CHRYSLER KNOWS OF THE ISSUE. WHY HASN'T THERE BEEN A RECALL?",
