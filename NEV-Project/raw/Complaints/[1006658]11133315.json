        "summary": "I HAVE BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE GEAR SHIFT ASSEMBLY. I HAVE THAT ONLINE THAT THIS HAS BEEN A KNOWN ISSUE WITH NISSAN VEHICLES FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS. THE ONLY WAY TO OVERRIDE THE ISSUE IS TO REMOVE THE BUTTON ON THE GEAR SHIFT AND INSERT A JEWELER'S SCREWDRIVER TO COMPRESS THE LOCK ALLOWING THE VEHICLE THEN TO SHIFT INTO REVERSE. THIS HAPPEN TO ME SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE I LEARNED ABOUT THE USE OF THE SCREWDRIVER, WHEN IT FIRST STARTED THE GEAR SHIFT WOULD OCCASIONALLY FREEZE UP. I WOULD WAIT A FEW SECONDS RESTART THE VEHICLE AND THE GEAR SHIFT WOULD RELEASE. THE COAST TO REPAIR THIS KNOWN MANUFACTURE PROBLEM RANGES FROM $600 TO $900 WHEN YOU CALL THE DEALER ABOUT THIS ISSUE. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A DEFECT SCAM THAT NISSAN DOES NOT WANT TO RESOLVE AS THEY MAKE MONEY FIXING THEIR OWN DESIGN FLAW. THIS ISSUE OCCURS ANY TIME YOUR VEHICLE IS IN THE PARKED POSITION ON THE GEAR SHIFT. IT OCCURS WHEN YOU START THE VEHICLE, IT ALSO HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE STUCK IN TRAFFIC AND THE CAR IS PUT IN TO PARK SO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO KEEP YOUR FOOT ON THE BREAK. I HAVE NOT PICTURE TO UPLOAD. I AM PROVIDING THE YOUTUBE VIDEO BY NISSAN THAT ACKNOWLEDGES THE PROBLEM EXISTS.  HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=B7ERIQY9E8A  *TR",
