MARCH 2017 THEY DID THE AIR BAG.....2 DAYS LATER THE AIR BAG LIGHT IS ON, HORN AND CRUISE CONTROL DOES NOT WORK AND THEY REFUSE TO REPAIR IT; STATING THAT IT IS THE MULTI-FUNCTION SWITCH. SO WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO DRIVERS SIDE AIRBAG. IN OUR ATTEMPTS TO HAVE THEM FIX IT THEY REFUSED AND WERE NASTY ABOUT IT. WE ATTEMPTED TO REACH A LOCAL DODGE REPRESENTATIVE AND NO ONE KNOWS WHO THAT MAY BE.",
