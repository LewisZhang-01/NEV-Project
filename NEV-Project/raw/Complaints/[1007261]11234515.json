I TOLD THEM ABOUT THE NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 16V563000 AND MITSUBISHII RECALL NUMBER SR-16-006 ON THIS SAFETY ISSUE, THEY REFUSED TO ENTERTAIN THIS POTENTIAL RISK BECAUSE MMNA DID NOT LIST MY VIN NUMBER AS POSSIBLE VEHICLE COVERED BY THIS RECALL. THEY INSTEAD OFFERED TO CHARGE ME THE THROTTLE BODY CLEANING AND CHANGE THE TRANSMISSION FLUID. I PAID FOR THE TRANSMISSION FUEL CHANGE AT APPROXIMATELY 26.600 MILES IN ADVANCE OF THE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE. THE CAR IS STILL HESITATING AT VARIOUS TEMPERATURES. I NEED THIS FIXED!! AND I WOULD LIKE AN APOLOGY FROM THE FACTORY TRAINED SERVICE TECHNICIAN THAT DID NOT LISTEN TO MY COMPLAINT!
