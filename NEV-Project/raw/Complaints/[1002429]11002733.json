THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED UP. THE ACCELERATOR STOPPED WORKING. I COULDN'T TURN IT OFF OR ON- IT WAS KIND ON JUST STUCK IN AN ALTERNATE MODE. THERE WAS AN ORANGE ENGINE SYMBOL THAT WAS LIT UP AND IT KEPT SAYING \"SHIFT TO PARK\" BUT I WOULD SHIFT AND NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN. I COULDN'T PUT IT IN NEUTRAL SO I COULD PUSH IT TO A SAFER LOCATION. NOTHING. THE TECHNICIAN ON THE PHONE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG WITH IT, BUT SOMEONE WHO STOPPED TO HELP SAID HE USED TO WORK ON THESE CARS AND SAID IT HAPPENS QUITE OFTEN AND IT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING I COULD HAVE DONE TO FIX IT (I THOUGHT I REMEMBER HIM SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT AN ENGINE SWITCH PROBLEM, BUT I WAS SO FRAZZLED I WASN'T REALLY LISTENING TO HIM) . IF THIS HAD HAPPENED ON A HIGHWAY I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. I DON'T KNOW HOW THESE CARS HAVE NO BEEN RECALLED.",
