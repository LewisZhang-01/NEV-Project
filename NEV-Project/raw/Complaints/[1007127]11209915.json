AS I GAVE MY VEHICLE GAS IN ORDER TO GET BACK UP TO SPEED, I FELT A PAUSE IN THE ENGINE AND THEN THE CAR COMPLETELY LOST POWER- THE ENGINE STOPPED, THE RED BATTERY ICON APPEARED ON THE DASH, AND MESSAGE APPEARED ON THE SCREEN WITH THE HEADING \"SPECIAL PROGRAM SUSPENDED\" OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT-- I HAD NO TIME TO READ THAT MESSAGE AS  I HAD TO STEER MY CAR AS FAR TO THE RIGHT AS I WAS ABLE TO.   I TRIED TO RESTART THE VEHICLE, IT WOULD NOT START AND THE MESSAGE DISAPPEARED-- I HAD NO CHANCE TO READ IT AS I WAS ON A BUSY AND HEAVY TRAVELED ROAD AND HAD TO ENSURE I WAS SAFELY PULLED OVER.  UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME AS TO WHAT CAUSED THIS MALFUNCTION. THIS CREATED AN UNSAFE CONDITION AS THE CAR LOST POWER WITH NO FOREWARNING.  I AM LUCKY THAT IT DID NOT HAPPEN ON THE HIGHWAY ON WHICH I TRAVEL MOST OF THE TIME.   I CONTACTED LAND ROVER ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND THE CAR WAS PUT ON A FLATBED AND BROUGHT TO THE DEALER.",
