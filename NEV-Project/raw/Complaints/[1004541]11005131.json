ALSO JUST HEARD THAT ANOTHER DRIVER HAS DIED BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM  ( 18 AND COUNTING WORLDWIDE ), AND THAT TAKATA HAS FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY!  SUPPOSEDLY THE LATEST DRIVER TO DIE RECEIVED 10 NOTICES AND FAILED TO HAVE THE PROBLEM RESOLVED. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS WHY I HAVE YET TOO RECEIVE EVEN MY 1ST NOTICE???  IS IT BECAUSE I AM A \"SECONDARY\" OWNER AND DO NOT HAVE THE SAME \"RIGHTS\" AS AN ORIGINAL OWNER?  PROTECTION SHOULD BE EQUAL UNDER THE LAW!!!",
