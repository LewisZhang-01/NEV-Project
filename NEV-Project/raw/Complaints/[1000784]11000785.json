WHEN IT CATCHES, AND I HAVE TO FORCE THE CORRECTION, IT TENDS TO RELEASE AND OVER CORRECT.  I HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL TO STAY IN MY LANE.  THIS IS A CONSTANT AND ON GOING ISSUE.  I WON'T LET MY SON DRIVE THIS CAR BECAUSE I'M AFRAID IT WILL CAUSE HIM TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT.  I'VE CALLED SEVERAL DEALERSHIPS AND THEY KEEP SAYING THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM, EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FOR THIS ON-LINE.  IT IS EXHAUSTING TRYING TO MAINTAIN YOUR LANE ON THE INTERSTATE AND IS A VERY SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.",
