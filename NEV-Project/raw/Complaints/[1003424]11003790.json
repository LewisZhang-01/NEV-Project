ANYTIME I GET INTO MY CAR AND PUT THE KEY IN THE IGNITION, IT LOCKS AND WON'T LET ME TURN THE KEY, IT TAKES SEVERAL TRIES BEFORE IT TURNS OVER. ONCE THE CAR IS ON AND DRIVING ON CITY STREETS LIGHT SMOKE WILL COME FROM THE AIRBAG. I IMMEDIATELY WOULD PULL OVER AND STOP THE CAR AND WAIT FOR A WHILE BEFORE HEADING HOME. THIS HAS HAPPEN SEVERAL TIMES WITH IN THE LAST 2 MONTHS. I'M CONCERNED THE AIRBAG WILL DEPLOY PREMATURELY WITHOUT AN ACCIDENT. I DON'T HAVE A PHOTO OR DOCUMENTS, HOWEVER I HAVE MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH A GMC DEALERSHIP.   PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE IS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THANK YOU",
