WE THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE THIS CAR SEAT FOR MANY YEARS USING IT AS DIRECTED, REAR FACING, FORWARD FACING WITH FIVE POINT HARNESS AND EVENTUALLY A BOOSTER SEAT. WE CALLED THE RECARO COMPANY AND GOT NO HELP. THEN WE EMAILED RECARO ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT OUR THREE YEAR OLD IS SMARTER THAN AVERAGE AND WE SHOULD TRAIN HER NOT TO PRESS THE RELEASE BUTTON. THIS IS UNEXCEPTABLE!!  WHAT IS HAPPENING IS OUR THREE YEAR OLD IS STRAPPED IN CORRECTLY BUT AT ANY TIME SHE CAN PRESS THE RELEASE BUTTON WHICH LOOSENS THE STRAPS SO SHE CAN TAKE HER ARMS OUT OF THE FIVE POINT HARNESS WHILE IT IS STILL BUCKLED UP. IF I HAVE TO STOP SUDDENLY SHE WOULD BE THROWN FROM THE SEAT. WE HAVE SCREWED A PIECE OF METAL IN THERE TO STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING BUT THIS MEANS THAT WE CANNOT GET HER OUT IN A HURRY. WE HAVE ANOTHER BRAND OF CAR SEAT, (BRITAX)  AND THERE ARE NO PROBLEMS WITH THAT RELEASE BUTTON WHERE A THREE YEAR OLD CAN PRESS THE BUTTON.   I REALLY WAS HOPING THAT RECARO WOULD HAVE A FIX FOR THE CAR SEAT. WITH NO FIX I FEEL THAT IT FAILS ALL SAFETY STANDARDS.",
