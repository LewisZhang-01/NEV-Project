        "summary": "MY SON AND I WERE ON WAY TO PEYTON MANNING CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN MY 2004 TOYOTA RAV4 WHEN THE DRIVER IN FRONT OF ME ABRUPTLY STOPPED, WHICH MADE ME ABRUPTLY STOP, HOWEVER, THE DRIVER BEHIND ME WAS NOT PAYING ATTENTION AND REAR ENDED ME AS I WAS COMPLETELY STOPPED AND HE WAS GOING ABOUT 30 MPH. THIS OCCURRED ON THE PASSENGER BACK OF THE VEHICLE CAUSING ALMOST $4,000 WORTH OF DAMAGE, HOWEVER, MY SON NOR MY SEAT BELTS LOCKED INTO PLACE, THEREFORE, HE SUSTAINED A SIGNIFICANT CONCUSSION, WHIP LASH, MILD MEMORY LOSS, AND NEEDING PHYSICAL THERAPY. BOTH OF MY HANDS WERE ON THE WHEEL, BUT I SUSTAINED WHIP LASH, INJURY TO BOTH MY LEFT  & RIGHT SHOULDERS, NECK, AND BACK. I MUST REINFORCE THAT STATEMENT THAT IF THE SEAT BELTS WOULD HAVE LOCKED PROPERLY MY SON AND I MAY HAVE NOT SUSTAINED THIS TYPE OF INJURY, THEREFORE, THIS ACCIDENT WAS LIKE WEARING NO SEATBELT WHEN WE WERE BOTH SECURELY BUCKLED IN AND THE SEAT BELTS NOT WORKING MADE IT LIKE WE WERE DRIVING WITH NO SEAT BELTS FOR PROTECTION.",
