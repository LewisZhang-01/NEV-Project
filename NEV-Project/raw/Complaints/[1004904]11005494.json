I SLAMMED THE BRAKES TO STOP AND MY TRUCK DID NOT STOP AND COLLIDED WITH THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.  THERE WERE NO SKID MARKS, THE TRUCK JUST DID NOT STOP.  I HAD THE BRAKES DONE THE DAY BEFORE AND I DID NOT STOP. I TOOK MY TRUCK TO FORD TO CHECK BRAKE BOOST VACUUM PUMP BECAUSE IT WAS MAKING NOISES.  THEY REPLACED IT BECAUSE THE PART WAS DEFECTIVE.  I BELIEVE THIS IS WHAT CAUSED MY ACCIDENT AND THE INABILITY TO STOP QUICKLY.  FORD HAS REPLACED THE PART AND THE BRAKES ARE WORKING PROPERLY BUT THE PUMP IS STILL NOISY.  I BELIEVE THIS TO BE RELATED TO THE  2011&#8208;2012 FORD F&#8208;150 EQUIPPED WITH 3.5L GTDI ENGINES  EA15&#8208;006 BRAKE VACUUM PUMP FAILURE",
