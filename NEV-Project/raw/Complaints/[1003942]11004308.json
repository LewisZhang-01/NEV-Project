        "summary": "I HAVE A 2012 HARLEY DAVISON V-ROD NIGHT SPECIAL WITH ABS BREAKING SYSTEM INSTALLED AT THE FACTORY. THIS IS NOT AN AFTERMARKET SYSTEM.  THE FRONT BREAK LEAVER IS HARD AS A ROCK. YOU CAN`T SQUEEZE THE BREAK HANDLE TO APPLY FRONT BREAKS. THERE IS NO BYPASS BUILT INTO THE BREAK SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS BREAKS TO ACT AS A MANUAL BREAKING SYSTEM. I CONTACTED THE LOCAL DEALER AND WAS ADVISED THAT THEIR WAS NO RECALL ON THE ABS SYSTEM ON THIS BIKE AND IF I WANTED TO BRING MY MOTORCYCLE TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT FOR $110.00 AN HOUR THE WOULD CHECK THE SYSTEM. THEY SAID THAT IT COULD BE THE ELECTRONIC ABS MODULE OR THE HYDRAULIC SYSTEM. THAT IT  WOULD BE $ 480.00 IF IT WAS THE HYDRAULIC MODULE PLUS LABOR. THIS IS A LARGE MOTORCYCLE WITH NO FRONT BREAKS. (WHICH DO 75-80 PERCENT OF THE STOPPING FOR THE MOTORCYCLE AND IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN. I KNOW THAT THEIR WAS A RECALL ON EARLY MODELS OF THIS CYCLE. I CHECKED ON-LINE AND THIS SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE THAT LOTS OF HARLEY DAVISON MODELS WITH  THE FACTORY ABS SYSTEM. COULD YOU PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS MATTER BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED.         THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION IN THIS MATTER.",
