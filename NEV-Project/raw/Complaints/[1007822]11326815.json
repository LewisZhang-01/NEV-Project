THE CAR WILL TEND TO VEER LEFT OR RIGHT, AND I HAVE TO PULL HARD ON THE STEERING WHEEL TO KEEP IT GOING STRAIGHT. THERE IS NO CONSISTENCY AS TO WHETHER IT VEERS LEFT OR RIGHT, AND THE DIRECTION CHANGES INTERMITTENTLY. THIS PROBLEM  HAPPENS ALSO INTERMITTENTLY, SOMETIMES EVERY FEW DAYS OR EVERY COUPLE OF WEEKS. TURNING THE CAR OFF AND THEN BACK ON RESOLVES THE PROBLEM, BUT THEN THE SAME PROBLEM EVENTUALLY OCCURS AGAIN SOMETIME LATER. THIS IS MOST LIKELY A SOFTWARE ISSUE.  THERE ARE MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS SAME BEHAVIOR ON I3'S ONLINE AND ON NHTSA WEBSITE.   THIS IS CLEARLY A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE, AND BMW SHOULD ADDRESS IT RIGHT AWAY.  *TR",
