SEVERAL LIGHTS ON THE DASH CAME ON INCLUDING THE CHECK HYBRID ENGINE, THE CHECK VSC SYSTEM, AND THE ABS LIGHTS. THE POWER BRAKES WERE OFF AND IT BECAME DIFFICULT TO STOP. THEN THE VEHICLE'S ENGINE STOPPED COMPLETELY REQUIRING ME TO MANEUVER OUT OF HEAVY TRAFFIC TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD. I TURNED ON MY HAZARD LIGHTS, BUT WAS ALMOST HIT BY SEVERAL VEHICLES AS I GOT TO THE SHOULDER.",
