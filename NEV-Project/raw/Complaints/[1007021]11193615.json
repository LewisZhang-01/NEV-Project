THE INSIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD BECAME EXTREMELY WET. WIPING THE MOISTURE ONLY RESULTED IN IMMEDIATE FOGGING OF THE WINDSHIELD. I SET THE FRONT AND REAR DEFROSTERS ON MAXIMUM AND ONLY A 8 INCH SEMI CIRCLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WINDSHIELD IN-FRONT OF THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER WOULD DEFOG. I RESET THE COMPUTER AND NOTHING CHANGED. AFTER 20 MINUTES I CALLED THE EMERGENCY SERVICE NUMBER FOR TESLA. THEY COULD NOT HELP ME BECAUSE I HAD ALREADY DONE EVERYTHING. THE THE TESLA PARKED NEXT TO ME HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE ONLY RESETTING THE COMPUTER CORRECTED THE PROBLEM. I  PREVIOUSLY OWNED THE SAME MODEL TESLA AND HAD THE SAME PROBLEM SEVERAL TIMES AND THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT LOCATED IN CINCINNATI COULD NOT FIND A PROBLEM OR SOLUTION.",
