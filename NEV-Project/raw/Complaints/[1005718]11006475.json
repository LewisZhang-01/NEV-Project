        "summary": "WHILE TRAVELING THOUGH THE MOUNTAINS OF WEST VIRGINIA SUDDENLY THE TEMPERATURE BEGAN TO STEADILY INCREASE TO WHERE THE GAUGE WAS HALFWAY BETWEEN NORMAL AND HOT.  I SLOWED THE VEHICLE FROM THE SPEED LIMIT TO ABOUT 55MPH WHICH BROUGHT THE TEMPERATURE BACK TO NORMAL.  AS WE CONTINUED ON THE TRIP THE TEMPERATURE WOULD SPIKE AND GO BACK TO NORMAL WITH DECREASED SPEED.  AFTER THE INITIAL SPIKE WAS NOTICED I PLUGGED A DATA LOGGER INTO THE CAR TO RECORD ENGINE TEMPERATURE AND MONITOR MORE CLOSELY.  THE TEMPERATURE SEEMS TO BE VERY ERRATIC AND SEVERAL TIMES REACHED A TEMPERATURE OF 233 DEGREES BEFORE I DECREASED SPEED AGAIN.  THIS SEEMS TO BE VERY HOT FOR AN ENGINE TO BE GETTING AND IS GREATLY CONCERNING CONSIDERING THE MOST RECENT RECALL ON OVERHEATING AND POTENTIAL FIRE.  I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE VEHICLE WOULD HAVE OVERHEATED AND BROKEN DOWN IF I HAD NOT TAKEN ACTION AS IT DID A YEAR PRIOR WHEN IT WAS SUPPOSEDLY FIXED.",
