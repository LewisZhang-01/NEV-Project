        "summary": "This is to report another incident of what is now known as the Ford Death Wobble.  Despite Ford's denial of this condition existing, it is real.  My truck has only 18K miles on it and I experienced the issue three times while driving on the freeway yesterday, Dec 02, 2021.  It is terrifying and if one of my daughters or other family member had been driving, I am scare to think what the result might have been.  There is much information about this issue on the internet, though I am not sure how much is fact or opinion.  What I do know is that it happened to me and it is real and serious.  I make this claim in part as documentation in case there is a serious accident related to this obvious defect.  I have an appointment with a local dealership tomorrow, Dec 04, 2021 to see if the issue can be fixed.  I will make clear to them the issue, the recording of my efforts to have the issue addressed by Ford and the documentation of this issue.  I implore the NHTSA to take action to demand Ford address this serious risk.  I encourage you to share this complaint with Ford officials.  I want to be on public record about this issue.",
