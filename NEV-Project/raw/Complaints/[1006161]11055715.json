I WAS ABLE TO GET OFF THE ROAD WITHOUT INCIDENT. THE DEALERSHIP SAID I NEEDED A NEW MASTER CYLINDER. I REPLACED IT. A WEEK LATER DRIVING MY CHILDREN TO SCHOOL I WAS STOPPING NORMALLY WHEN AGAIN THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR. NOW THE DEALERSHIP STATES THEIR \"BEST GUESS\" TO REPAIR IS TO REPLACE THE ABS ACTUATOR. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THIS WILL REPAIR THE PROBLEM. THIS WAS ESCALATED TO THE LEVEL OF THE NISSAN ENGINEER BECAUSE THE DEALERSHIP (JEFF SCHMITT NISSAN IN BEAVERCREEK, OHIO) WHICH IS A CERTIFIED NISSAN DEALER COULD NOT DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM INTERNALLY.",
