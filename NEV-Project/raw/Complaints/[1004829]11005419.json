THE DEALER DIAGNOSED THE VEHICLE PRIOR TO THE RECALL AND I WAS TOLD TO WAIT FOR THE RECALL BECAUSE THE ABS MODULE WAS DEFECTIVE. AFTER THE RECALL WAS ISSUED I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALER BUT VW REFUSED TO REPLACE THE ABS MODULE, AS STATED BY THE RECALL. REASON GIVEN, IS THAT THE ABS MODULE HAS PRE-EXISTING FAULTS. THIS IS OBVIOUS, THAT IS WHY IT FAILED. THE COMPONENTS ON THE BOARD ARE NOT SOLDERED PROPERLY THUS LEADING TO THE COMPONENTS ON THE BOARD TO COME LOOSE DUE TO THE NATURAL VIBRATION OF THE VEHICLE. THE ABS MODULE IS DEFECTIVE AND A SOFTWARE UPDATE WILL NOT REPAIR A BAD SOLDERING. PLEASE ADVISE.",
