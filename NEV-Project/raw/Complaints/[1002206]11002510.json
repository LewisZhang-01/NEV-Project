I DID THE FIX AND IT WORKED FOR A DAY AND A HALF.  THE ISSUE IS A PIN THAT SLIPS OUT OF PLACE ON THE SHIFT SELECT.  IT SLIPS OUT AND DOESN'T MAKE CONTACT TO TELL THE CAR'S ELECTRICAL THAT THE CAR IS IN PARK.  THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE IN THAT KEYS GET STUCK IN CAR AND CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO START CAR AND PUT CAR INTO DRIVE.",
