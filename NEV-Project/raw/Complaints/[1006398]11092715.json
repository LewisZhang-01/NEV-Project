THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE DEALER (DEPENDABLE DODGE, 21415 ROSCOE BLVD, CANOGA PARK, CA 91304, (818) 883-9060) MORE THAN ONCE. THE DEALER DID NOT FULLY INSPECT THE TIRES; HOWEVER, THEY REFILLED THE TIRES WITH AIR AND PROVIDED NO PERMANENT REMEDY. THE FAILURE CONTINUED AND THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC. THE VEHICLE WAS PLACED ON A LIFT AND THE MECHANIC NOTICED THAT THE OEM REAR PASSENGER RIM HAD CRACKS. THE DEALER WAS CONTACTED AND INDICATED THAT THERE WAS A NATIONAL BACKORDER FOR THE RIMS. THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THERE WERE 26 OTHER CUSTOMERS ALREADY ON THE WAITING LIST AND THAT THE PART MAY BECOME AVAILABLE AROUND JULY 20, 2018. THE DEALER FURTHER STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE UNTIL THE RIM WAS REPLACED. THE CONTACT WAS INFORMED THAT THE VEHICLE COULD BE LEFT AT THE DEALER UNTIL THE PART ARRIVED; HOWEVER, THEY WOULD NOT BE LIABLE IF ANYTHING HAPPENED. THE CONTACT DECLINED BECAUSE A LOANER VEHICLE WAS NOT OFFERED. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS NOT AVAILABLE.",
