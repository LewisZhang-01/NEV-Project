        "summary": "APPROX TWO MONTHS AFTER PURCHASING THE VEHICLE, AND AGAIN APPROX. SIX MONTHS AFTER PURCHASING THE VEHICLE, THE STEERING WHEEL TURNED TO THE RIGHT APPROX. 15-30 DEGREES AFTER VEHICLE START ... AS VEHICLE SPEED INCREASED AND DECREASED, THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD MOVE RIGHT AND LEFT ... DURING THIS TIME, THE VEHICLE WOULD MAINTAIN A STRAIGHT TRACK ON THE GROUND ... AFTER TAKING THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER, IT WAS DIAGNOSED AS WHEELS OUT OF ALIGNMENT ... HOWEVER, THE STEERING WHEEL OFFSET OCCURRED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE WHEELS WERE ALIGNED FOR BOTH INSTANCES ... AM CERTAIN THAT THIS ISSUE IS RELATED TO THE ADAPTIVE STEERING SYSTEM (2016 FORD EDGE SPORT IS THE FIRST VEHICLE TO GET THIS SYSTEM) ALTHOUGH I DID NOT GET AN ADAPTIVE STEERING SYSTEM FAIL LIGHT ON THE DASHBOARD DISPLAY ... THE STEERING WHEEL IS CURRENTLY TURNED TO THE RIGHT APPROX. 30 DEGREES ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE CONTINUES TO DRIVE IN A STRAIGHT LINE ... I'LL BE TAKING THIS VEHICLE TO FORD FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION BUT, TO DATE, THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM.",
