DAYS LATER MY CAR THREW A WENCH SIGN, ONLY ONCE AFTER THE CAR TURNED OFF IT DIDN'T SHOW UP AGAIN. THE CAR STARTED JERKING, THE RPMS WERE JUMPING AND THE CAR ACTUALLY SHUT OFF ON ME  WHILE DRIVING.  AFTER LOOKING UP THESE CODES THIS WAS AN ISSUE MANY OTHERS WERE HAVING WITH THIS CAR AND OTHER FORD MODELS.  IT HAS SINCE TURNED ON, RAN FOR SECONDS, AND TURN OFF SHORTLY AFTER.  EACH TIME A CODE IS RAN IT SHOWS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN IT DID PREVIOUSLY.",
