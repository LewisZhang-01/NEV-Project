Next morning upon entering the vehicle I noticed the crack. Within 2 days the longest crack had grown from about 2 inches towards the drivers side to about 10 inches. I called Subaru of America customer service with a complaint. They suggested taking it to the dealer for inspection and a determination if it\u2019s covered under the new car warranty. I have had the vehicle for about a year and it has less than 15000 miles on the odometer.",
