I REALIZED THE CAR WAS RUNNING BUT WOULD NOT GO FORWARD OR REVERSE.  I HAD TO CALL A TOW TRUCK.  I WAITED THREE HOURS FOR THE TOW TRUCK TO SHOW UP AND THEN HAD IT TOWED 80 MILES TO MY HOUSE.  I DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND THAT THE TORQUE CONVERTER SPLINES WOULD FAIL WITH NO WARNING.  I ALSO DID SOME TEST TO CONFIRM IT WAS THE TORQUE CONVERTER.  THERE ARE SO MANY COMPLAINTS WITH THE SAME ISSUE AND FORD MOTOR COMPANY HAS DONE NOTHING TO RECALL AND FIX THE PROBLEM.  DOES IT TAKE SOMEONE GETTING KILLED FIRST?  FORD NEEDS TO STEP UP AND RECALL TO FIX THIS PROBLEM BEFORE PEOPLE ARE KILLED.",
