ONCE I WAS OFF THE FREEWAY AT THE INTERSECTION WHEN I ACCELERATED MY CAR WOULD BARELY MOVE. THIS SEEMS LIKE A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE.  I HAVE HEARD OF OTHERS ALMOST BEING REAR ENDED BECAUSE OF THIS SAME ISSUE.  THEY SAY ITS DUE TO THE TRANSMISSION OVERHEATING AND GOING INTO SAFE MODE IN HOT TEMPERATURES.  MY VEHICLE WAS DOING THIS WHEN IT WAS 65 DEGREES OUTSIDE.  I THINK SINCE THIS SEEMS TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM AND WITH THE SAFETY BEING A CONCERN NISSAN SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.",
