THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION, PRESSURE WAS APPLIED TO THE ACCELERATOR AND THE CAR SHUT OFF. I HAD TO PULL OFF THE ROAD TO SAFELY.  I BELIEVE THE ISSUE WAS CAUSED WHEN I TRIED TO ACCELERATE. THE CAR REACTED TO ACCELERATION AND STARTED TO GO, BUT THEN FROZE UP, AND DIED.  I CALL A DEALER IN PRESTON, MD AND THEY SAID IF MIGHT BE A RECALL ISSUE.  GOT THE CAR TOWED TO THEM FOR ANALYSIS. AFTER SPEAKING WITH THE DEALER TODAY, THE 22ND, THEY SAID IT APPEARS IT IS AN ENGINE REPLACEMENT. THEY ARE REACHING OUT TO HYUNDAI FOR ASSISTANCE.",
