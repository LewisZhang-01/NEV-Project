EACH TIME I CALL THEY STATE THAT THE PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE OR THE ENGINEERING FIX IS NOT READY. THIS TIME I CALLED THEY WANT TO KNOW THE MILEAGE OF THE VEHICLE. I ASKED WHY AND DID NOT RECEIVE A VALID ANSWER FROM GM CUSTOMER SUPPORT. MY TOYOTA COROLLA HAD A TAKATA AIRBAG REPLACED TWO YEARS AGO. WHY IS IT TAKING GM SO LONG  TO REPAIR A SAFETY PROBLEM WHEN OTHER MANUFACTURES HAVE COMPLETED THEY SAFETY REPAIRS ? CUSTOMER SATISFACTION SHOULD BE A TOP PRIORITY FOR GM. I DON'T BELIEVE \"PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE\" OR AN AMERICAN ENGINEER CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO REPLACE AN AIR BAG. I AM A FATHER OF AN AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY AND NEED TO HAVE THIS CAR REPAIRED.",
