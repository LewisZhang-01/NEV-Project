THEN THE PASSENGER DOOR WOULD NOT OPEN FROM THE OUTSIDE.WE GOT THIS FIXED BECAUSE MY MOTHER IS ELDELY AND NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO EASILY OPEN HER DOOR. THIS WAS A COST OF  600.00. TO FIX THE BACK DOOR THEY WERE GOING TO CHARGE AN ADDTIONAL 600 OR MORE DEPENDING ON IF THEY BROKE THE DOOR PANEL , WE WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THAT AT OUR OWN COST TODAY MY PASSENGER BACK DOOR STOPPED OPENING FROM THE OUTSIDE. MY SON HAS TO CLIMB OVER THE SEATS TO LET HIS BROTHER IN. WHAT IF THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT IN WATER OR A FIRE AND MY CHILDREN WERE UNABLE TO OPEN THEIR DOORS .THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. THIS IS NO DOUBT A SAFETY CONCERN.",
