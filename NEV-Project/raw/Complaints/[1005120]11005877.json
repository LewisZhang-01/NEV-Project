        "summary": "THE 3RD ROW SEATING BUCKLES IN OUR JEEP COMMANDER BEGAN TO STICK ABOUT 6MOS AFTER PURCHASE. WE NOTICED THE BUCKLE WOULD STICK UNDER THE 3RD ROW SEATING AND THEN THE BUCKLE WOULD NO LONGER UNLATCH AT TIMES. THE BELT WOULD LATCH INTO THE BUCKLE, BUT WOULD GET STUCK INSIDE EVEN WHILE PUSHING THE RELEASE BUTTON. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER THE BUCKLE STICKING THE BUCKLE WOULD ALSO UNLATCH AT ANYTIME WITHOUT PRESSING THE RELEASE BUTTON (WHILE MOVING AND WHILE STATIONARY). DURING THIS TIME THE BUCKLE WAS UNSTABLE AND WE CHOSE TO USE THE PASSENGER SIDE FOR THE MAJORITY OF CAR RIDES, BUT AS WE HAVE A LARGE FAMILY USE OF THE BELT WAS NECESSARY. AT ONE POINT THE BUCKLE BECAME STUCK WHILE MY SON WAS RESTRAINED BY THE BELT. WE HAD TO PRY THE BELT OUT OF THE BUCKLE. FROM THIS POINT ON THE BUCKLE WOULD NO LONGER LATCH. A FEW MONTHS LATER WE NOTICED THE PASSENGER SIDE BUCKLE WOULD RELEASE AT ANY TIME, (MOBILE OR STATIONARY). THE BUCKLE WOULD ALSO STICK AND WOULD NOT RELEASE AT TIMES. IT APPEARS THE PASSENGER SIDE BUCKLE IS NOW UNSAFE AND HAVING THE SAME ISSUES THE DRIVER SIDE BUCKLE CAUSED. THE 3RD ROW SEATING IS ATTACHED TO THE BUCKLES IN A WAY IT SEEMS TO CAUSE THESE ISSUES WITH THE BUCKLE. I HAVE FOUND MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS ON GOOGLE FORUMS AND COMPLAINT SITES. THE BUCKLES ARE FAILING DUE TO FAULTY MANUFACTURING. THE 3RD ROW SEATING CAUSES DAMAGE TO THE BUCKLES. OVER TIME THESE BUCKLES NEED REPLACED MULTIPLE TIMES. THE BUCKLE RELEASES WITHOUT BEING RELEASED AND WILL CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH. THE BUCKLE RELEASE WILL STICK AND COULD CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH IN AN EMERGENCY WHEN PASSENGER WOULD NEED REMOVED. THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE A RECALL AND REPLACED IN ALL 2007 JEEP COMMANDER 3RD ROW SEATS. THIS ISSUE WILL CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH.",
