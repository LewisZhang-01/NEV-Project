THE NEXT DAY TOOK THE CAR TO THE SHOP TO HAVE THEM LOOKED AT TO SEE WHERE THE OIL LEAK IS COMING FROM. AFTER DIAGNOSIS THE RESULT WAS THAT REAR MAIN SEAL NEEDS TO BE REPLACED WITH THE PCV VALVE. TOTAL PRICE IS ABOUT $1500. I DID NOT HAVE ANY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND THIS SEEMS LIKE IT IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH AUDI VEHICLES WHERE THE PCV VALVE IS OVER PRESSURING THE ENGINE AND CAUSING GASKETS/SEALS THE BLOW. I BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AUDI TO FIX THIS PROBLEMS SINCE THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE AND HAS BEEN REPORTED A LOT OF 2.0T ENGINES.",
