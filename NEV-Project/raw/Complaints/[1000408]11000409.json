TO MY DISMAY, THE RIGHT REAR SHOCK MOUNT PULLED FREE FROM THE FRAME DUE TO RUST THAT WAS TO HAVE BE CORRECTED AT MY DEALERSHIP UNDER THE TOYOTA TRUCK FRAME RECALL.  I BROUGHT IT TO MY DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID IT WAS TOYOTA'S CHOICE TO EITHER UNDERCOAT OR REPLACE THE FRAME. MY VEHICLE WAS UNDERCOATED. UNFORTUNATELY I NOW HAVE AN UNSAFE, NON-DRIVEABLE AND UNSALABLE VEHICLE.  TOYOTA SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH VEHICLES THEY REPAIR CORRECTLY AND WHICH THEY COVERUP WITH UNDERCOATING. I APPEAL TO THE NHTSA TO LOOK INTO THIS MATTER AS RUST IS BLISTERING OUT FROM MULTIPLE AREAS UNDER THE UNDERCOATING. PLEASE HELP!",
