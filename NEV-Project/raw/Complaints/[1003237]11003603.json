THE PART WAS REPLACED BY A DEALER (HONDA OF SPRING, 17350 NORTH FWY, HOUSTON, TX 77090), BUT THE FAILURE RECURRED. THE DEALER INDICATED THAT THE BLOWER MOTOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. YEARS PRIOR TO THE FAILURES, THE VEHICLE WAS SERVICED BY MORE THAN ONE UNKNOWN DEALER AND EXTENSIVE ELECTRICAL REPAIRS WERE MADE, BUT THE REMEDY FAILED TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION. AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC STATED THAT THE BLOWER MOTOR DID NOT NEED TO BE REPLACED AND THE COMPRESSOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURE. THE VIN AND FAILURE MILEAGE WERE NOT AVAILABLE.",
