        "summary": "I NO LONGER OWN THE DESCRIBED VEHICLE BUT WANT TO REPORT A SAFETY ISSUE WITH THE VEHICLE.  I HAD ADVISED HYUNDAI CONSUMER AFFAIRS ANALYST, CENTRAL/CA RAYNISHA M. AND WAS ASSIGNED A CASE NUMBER 10184122.  INFORMATION ABOUT THE CASE NUMBER CAN BE OBTAINED FROM HYUNDAI.      MY PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLE WAS RELATED TO THE SPEED CONTROL SYSTEM OR \"FLY BY WIRE\" MECHANISM ON MY VEHICLE.  ON SEVERAL PERSONALLY DOCUMENTED INSTANCES (WITH ROAD CONDITIONS, DATES, TIME SPEED ETC.) I EXPERIENCED A ZERO ACCELERATION RESPONSE FROM THE VEHICLE WHEN APPLYING ACCELERATOR PRESSURE.  ON MANY ACCELERATION INCIDENTS THE ACCELERATION PEDAL RESPONSE \"FELL ON ITS FACE\" AND ON ONE OCCASION NEARLY RESULTED IN A VEHICLE COLLISION WHEN I WAS PROCEEDING INTO AN INTERSECTION.  I HAD REPORTED THE SAFETY ISSUE TO BOTH MY HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP AND HYUNDAI CONSUMER AFFAIRS.  THE TWO MECHANICAL INSPECTIONS THAT WERE PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM WERE INCOMPLETE AS THE VEHICLE DIDN'T THROW OFF ANY CODES TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM AREA.  I WAS TOLD BY THE VEHICLE MECHANICS THAT SINCE THE PROBLEM WAS INTERMITTENT IN NATURE THAT I WOULD HAVE NO REDRESS ON THE SAFETY ISSUE.  I AM A PRIVATE PILOT AND FLY AIRCRAFT UTILIZING \"FLY BY WIRE\" ACCELERATION DEVICES AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT MY FIRST INCIDENT OCCURRENCE WOULD HAVE GROUNDED THE AIRCRAFT EXPERIENCING THE SIMILAR ACCELERATION ISSUE.  I AM REPORTING THIS TO YOU HOPING THAT YOU CAN INVESTIGATE AND OPEN A RECALL INQUIRY AND FORCE HYUNDAI TO FIX OR MAKE CHANGES TO VEHICLES THAT UTILIZE THEIR \"FLY BY WIRE\" ACCELERATION SYSTEMS.",
