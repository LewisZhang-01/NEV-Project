EVEN THOUGH I HAD THE WHEEL STRAIGHT IT'S CLEARLY SHOWING IT HALFWAY TO THE RIGHT. IT'S DRAGGING THE FRONT PASSENGER TIRES AND IT'S HARD TO CONTROL. TOOK IT TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC BECAUSE  THERE'S NO WAY I CAN MAKE IT HOME WITHOUT ENDANGERING MYSELF AND OTHERS. THE MECHANIC SHOWED ME THAT UNDERNEATH THE SUBFRAME IS ALL ROTTEN/RUSTY AND FALLING APART. MY CAR IS 2009, IT'S ONLY 8 YRS OLD. THERE'S SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL ON THIS. I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE HOW BAD IT GOTTEN. I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO HAVE IT FIX.",
