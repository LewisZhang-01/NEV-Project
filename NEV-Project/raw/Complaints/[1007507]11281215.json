AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, ESPECIALLY IN A SLOW ARCHING TURN, IF THE TRUCK HITS A BUMP IN THE ROAD, THE STEERING WHEEL STARTS TO VIOLENTLY SHAKE. I BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DEALER (2ND TIME) AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THIS WAS THE 4TH TRUCK BACK THIS WEEK FOR THE SAME ISSUE. ALL THE DEALER CAN DO IS REPLACE THE STEERING COMPONENTS WITH THE SAME ONES THAT WERE ON THE TRUCK. SEEMS LIKE FORD JUST WANTS TO GET OUT OF THE WARRANTY PERIOD.",
