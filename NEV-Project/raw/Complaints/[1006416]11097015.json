WHEN PURCHASED NEW AND FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS DRIVING IT, THE AC WORKED PERFECTLY, THIS HAPPENED FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT. AFTER SEARCHING ONLINE FOR A RESOLUTION, I CAME ACROSS MULTIPLE OTHER CHEVROLET OWNERS WITH THE SAME ISSUE. THE CULPRIT CAME TO BE KNOWN AS THE AC CONDENSER. IT IS KNOWN THAT THE CONDENSERS USED BY GM FOR THIS MODEL TRUCK HAVE WEAK WELDS AND THIS IS WHERE THE CONDENSER FAILS PRODUCING A SMALL LEAK. AS IT TURNS OUT, GM IS AWARE OF THE ISSUE WITH THE AC CONDENSERS ON THESE VEHICLES AND REFUSES TO COVER THEM UNDER WARRANTY AND WANTS TO CHARGE UPWARDS OF $1K DOLLARS TO REPLACE. I AM COMPLETELY UNSATISFIED WITH THIS CONSIDERING MY TRUCK IS ONLY 2 YEARS OLD WITH UNDER 35K MILES ON IT. THIS IS TOO NEW OF A VEHICLE FOR THE AC TO BE HAVING PROBLEMS THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY.",
