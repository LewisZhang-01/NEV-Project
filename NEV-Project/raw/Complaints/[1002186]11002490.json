        "summary": "ABS BREAKS FAIL TWICE WITHIN 6 MONTHS WHEN MY WIFE HIT AN UNEVEN SURFACE PULLING INTO A DRIVEWAY.  THE BREAK PRESSURE REQUIRED HER TO FLOOR THE PEDAL ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FLOOR IN ORDER TO STOP THE VEHICLE.  I'M EXTREMELY CONCERNED.  MY WIFE PUMPED THE BREAKS TO GET THE VEHICLE'S BREAK PRESSURE BACK TO NORMAL.  WE ARE CONCERNED AND DON'T WHEN THIS COULD HAPPEN AGAIN.  WE ARE VERY FEARFUL AT THIS POINT.  WHAT IF SHE WAS GOING AT A FASTER RATE OF SPEED OR APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION.  THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL FOR THIS.  I CHECKED ONLINE AND THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE.  I CONTACTED FORD IN BURLINGTON NJ AND CARSENSE OF WESTAMPTON NJ BOTH PLACES TO GO TO EACH OTHER.  FORD IN LUMBERTON GAVE ME THE FORD 800 NUMBER WHICH I CALLED BUT THEY PROVIDED ME WITH EMPATHY BUT NO SOLUTION.  IF I DRIVE OVER AN UNEVEN SURFACE THIS EVENING IT'S POSSIBILITY MY BREAKS COULD FAIL AGAIN.  DOES SOMEONE HAVE TO DIE BEFORE SOMEONE TAKES ACTION AGAINST THIS HIDDEN DANGER.",
