I KNOW A LARGE NUMBER OF AUTOMOBILES WERE AFFECTED BUT I AM VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT IS TAKING FOR A REMEDY TO BE IN PLACE. THIS IS OUR FAMILY VEHICLE AND I SPEND MANY TRIPS A WEEK IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT FEELING UNSAFE. I HAVE TWO LARGE CARSEATS IN THE SECOND ROW AND THE THIRD ROW OF SEATS ARE DOWN IN ORDER TO TRANSPORT DIFFERENT THINGS. SO I HAVE NO WHERE TO SIT BUT THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT. IN ADDITION TO THIS RECALL, THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE POWER SLIDING DOOR. THERE HAS BEEN A RECALL IN EFFECT FOR THAT SINCE NOV. 2016 AND THERE IS STILL NO REMEDY.",
