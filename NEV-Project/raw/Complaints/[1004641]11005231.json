DEALER SERVICE ADVISER STATES INTERNAL OIL LEAK ONTO ENGINE HEAD, LIKELY REQUIRING ENGINE REPLACEMENT. I WOULD LIKE NHTSA TO INVESTIGATE TO EXPAND MODELS WITHIN CURRENT CAMPAIGN NUMBER 17V209000 AND/OR RESEARCH ADDITIONAL ISSUE WITH LEAKS IN CERTAIN FORD ENGINES. I HAVE NOT RECEIVED NOTICE FROM FORD MOTOR COMPANY THAT MY VEHICLE WAS INCLUDED IN CAMPAIGN NUMBER 17V209000, AND A VIN SEARCH ON THE NHTSA SITE CONFIRMED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT SUBJECT TO SUCH RECALL; HOWEVER, I BELIEVE IT IS LIKELY THAT MY VEHICLE IS IN THE SAME DANGER AS THOSE LISTED IN THE ABOVE-REFERENCED NHTSA RECALL EITHER FOR THE REASONS STATED IN THE RECALL OR ADDITIONAL REASONS. THANK YOU.",
