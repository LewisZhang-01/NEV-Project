I HAD TO USE A THIN PIECE OF PLASTIC AND LASSO IT BETWEEN THE DOOR, THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT METAL PART OF THE HEADREST, AND ALONG THE DOOR HANDLE. DESPITE DOING THIS THE DOOR REMAINED OPENED (AS DISPLAYED ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL) AND THE INSIDE DOME LIGHTS WOULD NOT CUTOFF.  I NOTICED THE DOOR WAS OPEN JUST AS I HAD BEGAN PULLING OFF. I HOPPED OUT SHUT THE DOOR GOT BACK IN ON THE DRIVERS SIDE ONLY TO SEE THAT THE INSTRUMENT PANEL WAS STILL DISPLAYING THAT THE DOOR WAS OPEN.  WHAT'S RIDICULOUS IS ON SEPT 6, 2016 I WENT INTO THE DEALER (MARSHALL FORD WERE I BOUGHT THE CAR BRAND NEW WITH 13 MILES ON IT) BECAUSE THE REAR PASSENGER DOOR DID THE EXACT SAME THING WHICH WAS UNDER RECALL 15S16. WAS ADVISED BY THE SERVICE MANGER 'JIM\" AT MARSHALL FORD,  1075 WEST TERRA LANE,O'FALLON,MO 63366 THAT THE \"REPLACEMENT PART HAD A 12 MONTH/12,000 MILE WARRANTY'..I'M WITHIN THE 1 YR TIMEFRAME BUT HAVE EXCEEDED THE MILEAGE COMPONENT. I HAD TO GET IT FIXED SO I CAN GET  AROUND AND WAS TOLD BY \"RANDOLF\" AT FORD MOTOR COMPANY CUSTOMER RELATIONS (800-392-3673) TO KEEP THE RECEIPT INCASE FORD ISSUES ANOTHER RECALL.  THIS IS BEYOND UNSAFE AND RIDICULOUS.",
