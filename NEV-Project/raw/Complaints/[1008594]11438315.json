        "summary": "When pulling into traffic from a stop the transmission seems to try and go into third gear then drops back into second gear.  This happens randomly but the result is that the car stops for a few seconds after pulling into traffic.  I have complained about this problem to the dealer from the time of purchase.  They have done extensive work on the transmission.  As the car has aged the problem has become progressively worse.  The dealer is now telling me that Chrysler knows the transmission has a problem but it is not endangering the public.  The problem is random but we have to be very careful when pulling into traffic because we never know when the car will hesitate and/or stop after pulling into traffic.  The problem has occurred randomly since purchase.  The date entered below is the date of the last occurance.",
