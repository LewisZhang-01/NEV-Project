COULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE OF CONTROL OF VEHICLE FOR DRIVERS NOT PAYING ATTENTION. TOYOTA DEALER SAID THE ROOT CAUSE WAS A BAD CELL IN BATTERY THAT CAUSED THE IGN#2 FUSE TO BE BLOWN. THESE BATTERIES HAVE KNOWN ISSUES TO BE BAD FROM THE FACTORY. REPORTED EARLIER ABOUT 30000 MILES THE FACTORY BATTERY WOULD NOT START VEHICLE AND DEALER SAID THEY REPLACED BECAUSE OF A BAD CELL. I OWN A 2008 TOYOTA TACOMA ALSO ,  SAME MODEL AND MAKE AS BEING REPORTED AND THAT BATTERY HAS BEEN REPLACED 2 TIMES FOR SAME REASON.",
