I JUST RETURNED FROM THE DEALERSHIP EARLIER TODAY WITH OVER $2800 WORTH OF REPAIR ESTIMATES; HOWEVER, THE VEHICLE SHOOK AND RATTLED WHEN IDLING AT A STOP LIGHT AND APPEARED TO BE OVERHEATING.  VEHICLE IS GARAGE KEPT, GETS REGULAR OIL CHANGES AND MAINTENANCE, AND IS DRIVEN MAINLY ON HIGHWAYS.  I DO NOT PULL ANYTHING (BOATS, CAMPERS, ETC.).  INTERNET FORUMS ARE LOADED WITH COMPLAINS ABOUT THIS ENGINE AND ALL SURROUND THE CAM PHASERS AND LOCAL ENGINE PARTS FAILING.  FORD HAS NO RECALL AND WILL DO NOTHING!  I HAVE A CASE IN THEIR SYSTEM AS OF THIS EVENING AND WOULD LIKE THE GOVERNMENT TO START ISSUING GUIDANCE TO CONSUMERS AND GET A RECALL PROCESS UNDERWAY.  ISSUE WAS FIRST NOTICED WHEN I TRIED TO START THE TRUCK ONE NIGHT IN MID-JUNE.  I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT IN MID-JULY TO GET THIS DIAGNOSIS.",
