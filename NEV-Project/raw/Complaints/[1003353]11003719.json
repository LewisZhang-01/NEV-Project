I NEED TO SELL MY CAR FOR MY WORK AND I AM UNABLE TO TRADE IN, EVEN TO CHRYSLER WITHOUT A HUGE REDUCTION IN THE VALUE DUE TO THIS RECALL. I RECEIVED A LETTER IN OCT 2016 INFORMING ME ABOUT THE RECALL. I WAS TOLD BY CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT THE PART WILL BE AVAILABLE IN JUNE 2017. WHEN I CALLED IN JUNE 2017, I WAS TOLD AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER OF 2017. EACH WEEK AND MONTH THAT THIS IS DELAYED, MY CAR IS DEPRECIATING AND I AM LOSING MONEY BY NOT BEING ABLE TO TRADE IT IN FOR MY JOB. I CANNOT BELIEVE 1.4 MILLION PEOPLE ARE ACCEPTING THIS DELAY BY CHRYSLER. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TRADE IT IN AT IT'S VALUE, BUT NOT FOR LESS THAN IT IS WORTH. WHAT CAN I DO?",
