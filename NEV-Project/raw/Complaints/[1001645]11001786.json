I HAVE APPLIED THE BRAKES AT THE END OF MY (CITY) STREET, ONLY TO HAVE THE BRAKES ENGAGE FOR A MOMENT, THEN DISENGAGE, ALLOWING THE CAR TO COAST FOR SEVERAL FEET, BEFORE FINALLY RE-ENGAGING AND STOPPING.  THIS LAST TIME IT OCCURRED, I ALMOST DRIFTED INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  I TOOK THE CAR TO MY MECHANIC AND THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG.  I NOW HAVE IT AT THE DEALERSHIP, BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO RE-CREATE THE ISSUE.",
