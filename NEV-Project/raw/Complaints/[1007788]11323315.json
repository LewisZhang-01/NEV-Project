I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO AN INFINITI DEALER WHERE THEY QUOTED ROUGHLY $1500 TO REPLACE AN AIRBAG SENSOR IN THE PASSENGER SEAT AND POSSIBLY THE SEAT BOTTOM. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN DUE TO A FAULTY COMPONENT. I CALLED INFINITI USA TO INQUIRE ABOUT RECEIVING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE REPAIR. THEIR RESPONSE WAS NO SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY. I AM AWARE THAT A SIMILAR RECALL WAS MADE TO THE 2008 G37 MODEL WHICH IS BASICALLY THE SAME CAR. A MALFUNCTIONING AIRBAG IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN FOR ME, AND I BELIEVE THIS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MANUFACTURER TO CORRECT.  *TR",
