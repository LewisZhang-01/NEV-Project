        "summary": "MY PASSENGERS REAR DOOR WAS NOT LOCKING WHETHER WHEN THE VEHICLE IS PARKED, RUNNING, AND DRIVING.  IF SOMEONE WAS TO ATTACK ME, OR MY FAMILY, I WOULD HAVE INSTINCTIVELY LOCKED THE DOOR.  IT WOULD NOT HAVE HAD ANY EFFECT ON KEEPING PEOPLE OUT.  IN MY RESEARCHING OF HOW TO FIX THE PROBLEM, I DISCOVERED THAT THE MORE COMMON PROBLEM IS THAT THE DOOR WILL NOT UNLOCK CREATING A GREATER HAZARD FOR EMERGENCY EGRESS.  THE PART IS RELATIVELY CHEAP, BUT IT IS A REAL BEAR TO REPLACE.  PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THE DODGE GRAND CARAVAN ARE MUCH EASIER TO REPAIR. (I.E., 2000-2008+?) AND CHEAPER TO REPAIR.  HOWEVER, ON THE 2016 VERSION (2010-2020) ONE HAS TO DISASSEMBLE THE WHOLE INNER DOOR COSTING $600+ FOR A SIMPLE REPLACEMENT. WITH THE HASSLE, AND COST OWNERS OF VEHICLES WITH SIMILAR PROBLEMS ARE LIKELY TO \"LIVE WITH IT.\" AND PUT THEIR FAMILY AT RISK.  HTTPS://YOUTU.BE/DDDCLYJILYA",
