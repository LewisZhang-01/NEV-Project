MOST OF THE F-150 ENGINE FIRES WERE TRACED BACK TO A FAULTY CRUISE CONTROL. THE VEHICLES USUALLY BURNED WHEN THE VEHICLE HAS 160-180,000 MILES ON THE SPEEDOMETER. MY 2000 FORD EXPEDITION BURNED CAUGHT MY HOME ON FIRE AND NEARLY KILLED THREE PEOPLE AND SEVERAL PETS.   THE VEHICLE IN QUESTION BELONGS TO A GOOD FRIEND. THEY MENTIONED IN PASSING THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL IS MALFUNCTIONING. THIS VEHICLE IS EXHIBITING THE EXACT SAME SYMPTOMS THAT MY EXPEDITION DID JUST BEFORE IT CAUGHT FIRE. I UNPLUGGED MY FRIENDS EXPEDITION CRUISE CONTROL. I AM SHOCKED THIS VEHICLE IS NO LONGER ON THE RECALL LIST. IF THIS VEHICLE WAS REPAIRED DURING THE RECALL IT WOULD NOT BE MALFUNCTIONING NOW.",
