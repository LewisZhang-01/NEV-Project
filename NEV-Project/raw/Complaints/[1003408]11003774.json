THIS IS A RECURRING PROBLEM AND IS VERY DANGEROUS!  SERVICE MANAGER SAYS IT'S DUE TO APPLYING BRAKE AND GAS AT THE SAME TIME WHILE WAITING FOR ONCOMING CARS TO CLEAR, BUT IT HAPPENS EVEN WHEN I'M CAREFUL NOT TO DO THAT.  NEARLY BEEN HIT SEVERAL TIMES.  IT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCELERATE WITHOUT FEELING HESITATION AND SURGING, EVEN IN A STRAIGHT LINE.",
