I PUT IT BACK CORRECTLY JUST AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO GO, BUT IT DID NOT FIX THE ISSUE. THE ENTIRE LATCHING MECHANISM HAS FAILED.  MY 2007 YARIS HAD A RECALL FOR THIS SAME ISSUE FOR THE DRIVER SEAT. THE CHASSIS FOR ALL MODEL YEAR YARIS' ARE THE SAME. I BELIEVE THE SEAT MECHANISMS WE'RE CONTINUED TO BE BUILT WITH A KNOWN ISSUE. MY CAR ONLY HAS 63,000 MILES AND THIS SEAT IS BARELY USED.",
