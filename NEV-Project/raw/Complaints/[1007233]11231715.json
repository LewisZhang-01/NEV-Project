I TOLD THEM THEY COULD HAVE THE CAR BACK.  SUDDENLY THEY WERE GOING TO REPAIR IT.  THEY TOLD ME THEY REPLACED THE ENTIRE PANEL.  2 DAYS AGO ALMOST EXACTLY 1 YEAR TO THE DAY,I WAS WASHING MY CAR AND IN THE EXACT SAME PLACE A CHUNK OF PAINT BLOWS OFF ( A BIT IRONIC).  I WENT TO A DIFFERENT DEALER (CANT TRUST SUPERSTITION SPRINGS AFTER THEY LIED TO ME).  I CALLED HONDA THEY SAID NO PROBLEM TO TAKE IT TO ANOTHER DEALER.  THE DEALER I TOOK IT TO SAID I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR SINCE HONDA SAID THEY HAD PAID FOR THE FIX ONCE. NO WAY THEY REPLACED THE PANEL BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO RECORD OF IT EVER BEING REPLACED AND THE PAPER WORK I HAVE DOES NOT STATE THE PANEL WAS REPLACED.  THEY DIDNT CHANGE THE PANEL, THEY SLAPPED SOME TOUCH UP ON IT AND SENT ME ON MY WAY.",
