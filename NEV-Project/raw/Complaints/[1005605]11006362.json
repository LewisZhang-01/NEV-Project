BY REDUCING THE CAR SPEED TO 40 MPH I WAS ABLE TO EXIT THE HIGHWAY AND PULL INTO A CAR REPAIR FACILITY IN HAGERSTOWN, MD.  I HAS THE CAR TOWED BACK TO THE AUDI DEALER IN TYSONS CORNER, VA.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT ONE OF THE FOUR FUEL INJECTORS HAD FAILED WHICH CAUSED IT TO REMAIN IN THE OPEN POSITION.  THE FUEL INJECTOR WAS REPLACED.  THE SERVICE FACILITY COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHAT MIGHT HAVE CAUSED THE FUEL INJECTOR TO FAIL.  THEY DID TEST THE OTHER THREE FUEL INJECTORS AND INDICATED THEY WERE FINE.  MY CAR HAS APPROXIMATELY 57,000 MILES ON IT AND I AM INTERESTED IN LEARNING WHETHER YOU ARE AWARE OF OTHER FUEL INJECTOR FAILURES IN THIS OR OTHER AUDI VEHICLES.",
