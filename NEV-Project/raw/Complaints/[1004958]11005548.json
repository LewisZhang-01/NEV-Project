CAME OUT AND LOADING MY 2 BAGS AND PROCEEDED TO CRANK UP MY CAR AND IT WOULDN'T START. JUST A QUICK CLICK BUT THE ENGINE WOULDN'T START. PLS NOTE THAT THIS HAPPENED A DAY AFTER IT WAS SHOWN ON THE NEWS THAT DODGE WERE HAVING RECALLS ON ALTERNATORS AND DRIVER SIDE AIRBAGS.IN PARTICULAR, 2011-2016 DODGE CHARGERS WITH 5.7L & 3.6L. I HAVE A 5.7L ENGINE. I HAVEN'T RECEIVED A CARD YET IN THE MAIL REGARDING THESE RECALLS, BUT I DID GO TO THE WEBSITE AND IT STATED THAT IT WOULD AUGUST 21ST BEFORE THEY MAIL THEM OUT. I ALSO WENT AHEAD AND PUT MY VIN# ON THE WEBSITE & NO RECALLS APPEARED. BUT THE WEBSITE STATED THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WON'T SHOW UP LATER. CAN I STILL GO TO A LOCAL DODGE CENTER AND REPORT THIS ISSUE AND GET THEM TO REPLACE IT FOR FREE BASED ON THE TELEVISED RECALL ON THESE PARTS AND THAT MY CAR FALLS INTO THE DESCRIPTIONS? I WAITED AN HOUR AND A HALF TO GET MY CHARGER TOWED BACK TO MY HOME VIA MY CAR INSURANCE WITH ROAD SIDE ASSISTANCE. PLS NOTE THAT THIS IS THE 3RD RECALL ON THIS CAR.",
