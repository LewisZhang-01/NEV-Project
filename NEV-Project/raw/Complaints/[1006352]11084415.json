ON A SEPARATE OCCASION I WAS DRIVING ON A CITY STREET AND IT WENT INTO NEUTRAL AGAIN.  I HAD TO TURN ON THE CAUTION LIGHTS AND RESTART THE CAR.  AS I MADE IT TO MY DRIVEWAY IT WENT INTO NEUTRAL AGAIN AS I WAS TURNING.  I TOOK IT INTO THE DEALER AND THEY CANNOT PINPOINT TO CAUSE BUT SPECULATE UNMETERED AIR AS A POTENTIAL CAUSE.  READING ABOUT THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM I CAME ACROSS A RECALL DESCRIBING MY EXACT PROBLEM BUT FOR 2006 5 SERIES.  MY CAR IS A 2007 7 SERIES. THE NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID NUMBER IS 16V919000.  THE RECALL DESCRIBES A PROBLEM IDENTICAL TO MINE.  UNFORTUNATELY I HAD TO SPEND $187 TO FIND OUT THAT THERE WAS NO DEFINITIVE SOLUTION.",
