I CONTROLLED IT ENOUGH OFF THE ROADWAY INTO A FIELD AND STOPPED, IF THERE WAS A GUARDRAIL OR DROP OFF, I WOULD HAVE MAJORLY CRASHED. I COULD TURN LEFT, GO STRAIGHT. BUT GOING RIGHT I'D TURN THE WHEEL 1 FULL TURN BEFORE IT 'ENGAGED' STEERING.  AFTER INSPECTING THE TRUCK, I NOTICED THE TRACK BAR WOULD MOVE 4-6 INCHES BEFORE THE WHEELS WOULD EVER MOVE.   WHEN SHAKING THE WHEEL WHILE PARKED, THE WHEELS WOULD NOT MOVE BUT THE ENTIRE BODY OF THE TRUCK WAS MOVING LIKE CRAZY AS IF IT WERE DANCING.  AFTER PULLING THE TRACK BAR OFF THE TRUCK, THE ENTIRE 'HEAD' AROUND THE BEARING ATTACHED TO FRONT PASSENGER SIDE WAS COMPLETELY SHEARED SHEARED ON 1 POINT CAUSING THE BEARING TO HAVE FREE PLAY. THIS TRUCK IS 3 YEARS OLD WITH 57,000 PAVEMENT MILES.  CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THE STEERING MECHANISM SHOULD NOT HAPPEN AND COULD POTENTIALLY KILL SOMEONE.",
