DURING A SERVICE IN 2/2016, I FOUND OUT THERE WAS A 20,000 MILE DISCREPANCY. THEY SUPPOSEDLY FIXED THE ENGINE BUT THE A/C WAS NOT COVERED IN THE STANDARD WARRANTY. SINCE THEN, I BOUGHT MY CAR TO AUTONATION IN APROX. 12 TIMES. LAST TIME, I BOUGHT THE CAR OVER IN MAY, I DROPPED IN OFF BECAUSE MY CAR WAS SHAKING, GAS WAS COMING OUT THE PIPE AND THEN IT STOPPED AND RECEIVED MY CAR BACK  OVER 24 HOURS LATER. WHEN I PICKED MY CAR BACK, I RECEIVED A ESTIMATE OF ATLEAST $3,000 AND WAS TOLD IF I WERE TO GET THE CERTAIN REPAIRS DONE TO THE CAR, IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT, MY CAR WOULD STOP HAVING THE PROBLEM, WHEN THE CAR STOPS. AGAIN, THIS MONTH, MY CAR DID THE SAME THING AND THE TRUNK DOOR WOULD NOT STAY OPEN, I HAVE TO HOLD THE DOOR UP WITH MY HANDS. THEN I TOOK IT SOMEWHERE ELSE, THAT REPAIR CENTER, STATED THAT MY COMPUTER HAS PROBLEMS, I NEED A NEW CONDENSER AND COMPRESSOR.",
