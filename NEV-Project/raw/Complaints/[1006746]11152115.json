AFTER THAT, SMOKE STARTED COMING OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD. THE KIA WAS TOWED TO THE KIA DEALERSHIP AND CHECKED BY MECHANICS, WHO SAID THAT THE ROD BEARING WENT BAD AND IT SEIZED THE ENGINE. THE STARTER WAS ALSO FRIED IN THE PROCESS.  KIA AGREED TO REPLACE THE PARTS BUT WOULD NOT AGREE TO PAY THE APPROXIMATELY $2500 LABOR COST. THE VEHICLE STILL SITS AT THE DEALERSHIP AWAITING REPAIR. IT'S BEEN OVER 2 MONTHS NOW. I PLAN TO PURSUE HAVING KIA PAY FOR THE LABOR AS WELL. I NOW OWE $7000 ON A CAR THAT WILL NOT RUN.",
