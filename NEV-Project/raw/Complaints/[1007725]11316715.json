THIS WAS DUE TO THE TRANSFER CASE ISSUES THAT MAZDA HAD TO EXTEND THE WARRANTY ON THEM BECAUSE OF SO MANY ISSUES WITH THEM.   THEY ARE COVERED FOR 90 THOUSAND MILES OR 7 YEARS.    MY TRANSFER CASE WAS ALREADY REPLACED ONCE AND DO TO ISSUES AND NOW SINCE MY CAR IS PAST THE 7 YEARS BUT ONLY HAS 60 THOUSAND MILES THEY WILL NOT PAY FOR IT.   EVEN THOUGH THE TRANSFER CASE THEY REPLACED A FEW YEARS AGO SHOULD STILL BE UNDER WARRANTY.    THIS SITUATION COULD OF BEEN A LOT WORSE AND THANK GOODNESS MY CHILDREN WERE NOT IN THE CAR WITH ME.",
