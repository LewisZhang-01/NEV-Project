        "summary": "My vehicle randomly slams on the brakes without the driver touching the brake pedal. My vehicle automatically applies the brakes without any vehicle stopping in front of it or a pedestrian in the vehicle\u2019s path. It happened a couple of times, fortunately, it did not culminate into a crash so far.  I took my vehicle to the dealership after these incidents, they explained to me that the sensor was loose. But I am not convinced that they fixed the problem.  I am afraid that this may happen in the future unless Honda comes up with a permanent fix. I can deactivate this feature, but once I turn the vehicle off and turn it back on it gets activated again. Please look into this matter seriously before it turns catastrophic.
