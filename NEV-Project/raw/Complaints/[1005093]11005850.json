DEALERSHIP REFUSING TO INCLUDE MY CAR ENGINE IN RECALL BECAUSE OF HYBRID -EVEN THOUGH IT HAS A GAS ENGINE. KIA CORPORATE CONTACTED AND STATED THEY WERE WILLING TO \"WORK SOMETHING OUT\" WITH IT IF DEALERSHIP WILL CONTACT THEM. I CANNOT GET DEALERSHIP TO DO THIS YET. LIKELY LEGAL COUNSEL WILL HAVE TO BE CONTACTED. INSURANCE ADJUSTER ALSO COMMENTED DEFECTIVE PART LIKELY CAUSE. GOOD THING I DID NO HAVE CARDIAC ISSUE -HAD TO WAIT IN HEAT ON HIGHWAY DURING SUMMER MORNING FOR TOW TRUCK AFTER SUDDEN ENGINE FAILURE IN TRAFFIC WHILE EXITING ON TO THE HIGHWAY. ALSO FORTUNATE THE CARS BEHIND ME DID NOT HIT ME CAUSING MORE DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY. STILL TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE.",
