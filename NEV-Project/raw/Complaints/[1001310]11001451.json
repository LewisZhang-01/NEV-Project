MY VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE AUTO REPAIR SHOP AND IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE BATTERY IS DEAD, THE ALTERNATOR IS DEAD AND THE PCM IS FRIED..... WHILE DO SOME RESEARCH I CAME ACROSS A RECALL THE P60 RECALL FOR THE ALTERNATOR FIR THE DODGE DURANGO YEARS 2011-2014 WHICH WOULD BE THE SAME VEHICLE I HAVE OTHER THAN THE ALTERNATOR IS 160 AMPS AND MY DURANGO HAS A 220 AMP ALTERNATOR. I BELIEVE THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED TO INCLUDE THE 220 AMP ALTERNATOR UNDER THE SAME RECALL AS THE P60, BECAUSE THE VEHICLES ARE THE SAME AND IT APPEARS THAT THE ISSUE I HAD IS THE SAME AS THE 160 AMP ALTERNATOR.......",
