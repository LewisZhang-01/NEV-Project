WHEN WE'VE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS TO THE AUTHORIZED SERVICE DEPARTMENTS, THE EXISTENCE OF A KNOWN PROBLEM HAS BEEN DENIED AND IT'S BEEN STATED THIS ISSUE IS 'NORMAL WEAR & TEAR', WHICH IT CLEARLY IS NOT.  WE JUST FOUND OUT YESTERDAY THERE WAS ACTUALLY A TSB (TSB 14-034) PUT OUT ON THIS, ALONG WITH A WARRANTY EXTENSION THAT IS NOW EXPIRED.  ACCORDING TO THE TSB, OWNERS WERE BEING NOTIFIED OF THE WARRANTY EXTENSION.  WE HAVE NEVER RECEIVED NOTIFICATION AND AS STATED ABOVE, WHEN WE'VE COMPLAINED, WE'VE BEEN TOLD THERE WAS NO PROBLEM.  THE COST TO FIX THIS WILL BE SIGNIFICANT AND AS TIME GOES BY, THE PAINT ISSUE IS BECOMING WORSE.",
