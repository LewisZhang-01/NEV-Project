MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN IF ROAD SURFACE IS ROUGH THAT VEHICLE IS TURNING ONTO.  THE VEHICLE WILL BEGIN TO ACCELERATE AND THEN LOSE ACCELERATION.  ALTHOUGH PRESSING THE ACCELERATOR THE CAR DOES NOT SPEED UP EVEN THOUGH THE ENGINE REVS UP.  AFTER ABOUT 3 OR 4 SECONDS THE VEHICLE THEN RESPONDS AND BEGINS TO ACCELERATE.  THIS SITUATION DOES NOT OCCUR ALL THE TIME.  IT MAY OCCUR 3 OR 4 TIMES IN A WEEK.  THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN BECAUSE I HAVE ALMOST BEEN HIT FROM BEHIND  AS A RESULT OF THE VEHICLE NOT ACCELERATING.",
