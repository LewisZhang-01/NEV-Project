WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE VEHICLE IS STILL DRIVABLE, BUT VARIOUS FEATURES, LIKE AIR CONDITIONING, BACK UP CAMERA, RADIO, ETC ARE NOT AVAILABLE.  NOT SURE WHAT ALL FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE, LIKE AIRBAG.  OUR MECHANIC HAS SEEN THIS ISSUE REPORTED BY OTHER 2010 CHRYSLER TOWN & COUNTRY 3.8L TOURING AND DODGE CARAVAN OWNERS AND HAS BEEN INFORMED THAT THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE L25 RECALL.  WHEN I CONTACTED THE DEALER THAT I PURCHASED MY 2010 VAN FROM NEW, THEY TOLD ME THAT MY VAN WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE L25 RECALL.  NEED TO HAVE THIS ISSUED REVIEWED AGAIN, SINCE MY 2010 VAN IS HAVING THE SAME ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN REPORTED FOR OTHER VINS.",
