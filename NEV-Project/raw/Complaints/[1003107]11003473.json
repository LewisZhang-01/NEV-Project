        "summary": "I AM AN OWNER OF A 2016 FORD EXPLORER THAT WAS PURCHASED BRAND NEW AT A DEALERSHIP HERE IN AZ LAST YEAR IN JANUARY. IMMEDIATELY AFTER PURCHASE, I STARTED NOTICING FUEL LEAKAGE FROM THE VEHICLE AND VEHICLE USING A LOT OF GAS EVERYDAY. I TOOK MY TRUCK BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD EVERYTHING IS OK. AS TIME WENT ON, I NOTICED THAT EVERY TIME I ACCELERATED ON THE GAS, THE TRUCK SLOWED DOWN. TOOK TRUCK TO DEALERSHIP AND WAS TOLD ONCE AGAIN NOTHING IS WRONG. A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, THE BATTERY DIED. I HAVE THE TRUCK TOOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY REPLACED THE BATTERY. TWO WEEKS LATER, THE BATTERY DIES AGAIN. I HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN. THEY REPLACED THE BATTERY AGAIN AND NOTICED A RECALL ON THE TRUCK. A WEEK LATER I'M DRIVING MY KIDS TO SCHOOL WHEN THE DASHBOARD GOES BLACK AND THEN LIGHTS UP AGAIN. ALL OF A SUDDEN IT HAPPENS AGAIN, THE DASHBOARD GOES BLACK AND THE SPEED STARTS DECELERATING. I HURRY UP AND GET TO THE SAFETY SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY. I CUT THE TRUCK COMPLETELY OFF, WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND IT STARTED RIGHT BACK UP. I TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE DEALERSHIP. ONCE AGAIN, I'M TOLD THAT NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE. YESTERDAY THE TRUCK DASHBOARD STARTS GOING ON AND OFF. THEN THE TRUCK COMPLETELY DIES. I CALLED ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP. I WAITED FOR OVER 5 HOURS AT THE DEALERSHIP BEFORE THEY TOLD ME WHAT \"MIGHT\" BE THE PROBLEM. I WAS TOLD THERE MIGHT BE AN ELECTRICAL SHORTAGE BETWEEN THE MONITOR, RADIO, ODOMETER, AND CLIMATE CONTROLS THAT IS CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO SHUT DOWN. THE DEALERSHIP DOESN'T HAVE PARTS TO FIX IT BUT CAN ORDER THEM AND IT MIGHT TAKE A FEW WEEKS TO GET THEM. AS OF NOW I HAVE NO AIR CONDITIONER AND MY RADIO ISN'T WORKING. I HAVE SPOKEN WITH SEVERAL CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGERS ABOUT THE VEHICLE AND WAS TOLD THERE ISN'T ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE EXCEPT WAIT FOR FORD TO FIX IT.",
