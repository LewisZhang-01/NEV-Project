THE STEERING FELT LIKE IT LOCKED UP, BUT IT WAS JUST VERY VERY VERY HARD TO TURN THE WHEEL.  I HAD TO STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET AND WAIT FOR HELP.  WHEN THE CAR WAS TURNED BACK ON EVERYTHING WAS FINE!!  (CRAZY).  2 DAYS LATER STOPPED AT MY MAILBOX AFTER WORK AND IT WENT CRAZY AGAIN.  TURNED THE CAR OFF AND BACK ON AND IT WHENT AWAY AGAIN.  TOOK THE CAR TO THE ACURA DEALER BUT THEY COULD REPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  ON THE WAY HOME STOPPED FOR FOOD AND I GOT STUCK IN THE DRIVE THROUGH (I COULD NOT TURN THE WHEEL TO MANUEVER OUT OF THE DRIVE THROUGH).",
