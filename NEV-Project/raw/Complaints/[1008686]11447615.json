        "summary": "RAM has teamed with T Mobile to add cell access back to the Uconnect system. 2016 models work with 3G, which was phased out 1 JAN 2022. RAM sent me a T Mobile 4G adapter that plugs into the OBD2 port under the dash. When installed, the adapter sticks out at least 3 inches below the dash and interferes with brake and accelerator. Clearly this was a rush job and not thought thru. I have been unable to get any assistance from RAM regarding this. I've included a pic of this device installed.   RAM's reply to me Here's my first reply from RAM regarding Uconnect - doesn't answer the question - see further  Hello Christopher Thank you for contacting Stellantis Customer Assistance Center I am seeing that this vehicles Uconnect Connected Services are through Uconnect Access. For assistance with your Uconnect Services, you will need to call Uconnect Access at 1-855-792-4241. This hotline is open 24/7 so you may call at any time. Regards, Maurice Customer Service Representative Stellantis Customer Assistance Center  My concern is the T Mobile adapter when plugged into the OBD 2 port on my truck interferes with access to the brake and  accelerator pedal. This device sticks our at least 3\" under the dash. Why??? Maybe, you could offer a short extension to move the adapter away from vehicle controls. This is a safety hazard.",
