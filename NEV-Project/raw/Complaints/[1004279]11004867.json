THERE WAS ALSO A LOUD HISSING NOICE. NO LIGHTS SUCH AS ABS WAS ON  WHEN I STARTED THE CAR. I THANKFULLY DIDN'T HIT ANYONE AND WAS ABLE TO COAST AND WAIT FOR THE CAR TO STOP. LONG STORY SHORT IT HAD TO DO WITH A  SAFTEY RECALL ( THE RECEIPT SAYS RECALL P14) FOR THE BRAKE BOOSTER THAT WAS NOT FIXED AT THE DEALERSHIP CORRECTLY. I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THE CAR OVERALL, I HAD THREE PROBLEMS IN ABOUT A MONTH WITH MY KIDS IN THE CAR ALL THREE TIMES.",
