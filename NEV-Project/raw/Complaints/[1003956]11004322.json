        "summary": "THE SEATS IN MY 2017 HONDA H-RV WERE SO UNCOMFORTABLE I HAD TO TRADE IT IN AFTER HAVING ONLY PUT 250 MILES ON THE CAR.  NO MATTER WHICH WAY I ADJUSTED THE SEATS, IT WAS NO BETTER.  WHEN I WENT TO THE DOCTOR SHE TOLD ME EVERYTHING BELOW MY WAIST WAS SPASMING.  THE SEATS WERE VERY HARD, NARROW AND THE DRIVERS SEAT BELT WAS PRESSED RIGHT UP AGAINST YOUR HIP AND YOU COULDN'T MOVE IT.  I LOST $2000 DOLLARS WHEN I TRADED THAT CAR IN AND I KNOW FROM ALL THE ARTICLES I'VE READ THAT HONDA HAS BEEN AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM FOR SOME TIME.  BUT THEY KEEP RIPPING OFF THE CUSTOMERS.  THE TEST DRIVE IS NOT LONG ENOUGH TO DETECT THE PROBLEM AND I BELIEVE ANYONE WHO HAS TO TRADE IN THEIR CAR FOR THIS PROBLEM SHOULD BE COMPENSATED.  I NOTIFIED THE DEALER WHEN I HAD ONLY 25 MILES ON THE CAR AND THEY WOULD NOT TAKE IT BACK.",
