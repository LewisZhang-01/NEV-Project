A LITTLE OVER A MONTH AGO THE CAR BRAKED ON ITS OWN WITH MYSELF, MY MOTHER, SISTER, AND MY 2 YEAR OLD SON IN THE CAR FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON GOING 45 MILES PER HOUR. THE NEXT INCIDENT THE CAR DECIDED IT WAS NOT GOING TO BRAKE AND WE HAD TO STEP ON THE BRAKES SO HARD TO GET ANY KIND OF REACTION, ALMOST CAUSING AN ACCIDENT. AT THIS POINT WE TOOK IT TO VW AND THEY ARE CLAIMING THERE IS NO ISSUES WITH THE CAR; I BEG TO DIFFER! YESTERDAY AGAIN THE CAR BRAKED ON ITS OWN GOING 30 MILES AN HOUR FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. TOOK THE CAR TO MY PERSONAL MECHANIC PRIOR TO TAKING IT TO VW AND A PIC OF WHAT CAME UP ON THEIR DIAGNOSTIC COMPUTER IS UPLOADED. THE VW DEALERSHIP I TOOK IT TO AFTER KEEPING IT TWO WEEKS CLAIM THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR; HOWEVER, THEY RESET MY COMPUTER IN THE CAR AND NOW THE CAR IS SHOWING NO CODES.
