THE CAR DOES NOT START NOW.  IT'S PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY.  HAVE TO GET IT TOWED TO THE DEALER NOW.  I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF THIS. THEY KNEW THERE WAS A PROBLEM. THE MECHANICS CHECKED IT, WASHED IT AND FILLED IT UP.  SO  I CALLED THEM BACK TODAY. THEY SAID NOTHING.  NOW I HAVE TO PAY MORE MONEY TO GET MY CAR FIXED.  THEY'LL HERE FROM ME AGAIN AFTER IT GOES TO THE DEALER.",
