        "summary": "2016 JEEP RENEGADE TRAILHAWK LOSS OF POWER ACCELERATING FROM A STOPPED POSITION, TURNING/MERGING INTO TRAFFIC FORM A SLOWED/STOPPED POSITION, VEHICLE STOPPING UP HILL. 13,200 MILES THE 'CHECK ENGINE' LIGHT ON, ENGINE POWERED DOWN TWICE WHEN PULLING OUT FROM A STOP & TURNING LEFT W/ SLIGHT INCLINE, ONCE GOING STRAIGHT ACROSS A 2-LANE HWY, & ENGINE POWERING DOWN WHEN MERGING. DEALERSHIP SAID DUE TO AN UPDATE NEEDED. TWO WKS AFTER THE UPDATE, ENGINE POWERS DOWN MAKING A RIGHT TURN FORM A STOP SIGN. DEALERSHIP COULDN'T REPLICATE & TOLD TO DRIVE CAREFUL. A FEW WKS LATER, I WAS STOPPED AT A STOP SIGN. I MADE A LEFT-HAND TURN W/ AN INCLINE. AS I STARTED ACCELERATING, THE RENEGADE SUDDENLY LOST SPEED & CEASED TO MOVE AS I WAS PRESSING THE GAS PETAL. THOSE FEW SECONDS OF PULLING OUT W/ ONCOMING TRAFFIC COULD QUICKLY LEAD TO A WRECK WHEN YOU LOSE POWER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. I FELT A GREAT DEAL OF PANIC, DISTRUST OF MY RENEGADE. I FEARED FOR MY SAFETY. I TAKE THE RENEGADE BACK TO THE SHOP NO REAL RESOLVE. I WAS DRIVING UP A STEEP HILL AT WHICH TIME MY RENEGADE COMPLETELY STOPPED AS I WAS NEARING THE TOP OF THE HILL. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, THIS WAS TERRIFYING TO SAY THE LEAST! WHEN THE RENEGADE STOPPED, I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO NOT HAVE ANYONE FOLLOWING BEHIND ME. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE ANGLE & STEEPNESS OF THE HILL, I WAS PANICKED THE RENEGADE WOULD ROLL DOWN. I NEVER PUT MY FOOT ON THE BREAK & CONTINUED TO PUMP THE GAS. AFTER ABOUT 5 PUMPS ON THE GAS, THE RENEGADE BEGAN TO SLOWLY ACCELERATE. I WAS GOING AT A RATE OF SPEED OF AROUND 30MPH, 1/4 OF TANK OF GAS, & DRIVING FOR ABOUT 10 MINS BEFORE INCIDENT. CHRYSLER ISN'T TAKING THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY. I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT W/ THEM ON A CORP. LEVEL AS WELL. THE RENEGADE HAS HAD 3 MORE INCIDENTS OF LOSING POWER WHEN ACCELERATING IN A TURN FROM A STOP. I FEAR FOR MY LIFE & AM STUCK W/ AN UNTRUSTWORTHY NEW VEHICLE.",
