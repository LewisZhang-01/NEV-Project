THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME AFTER THE 2ND TIME IN FOR THIS PROBLEM THAT THE VEHICLE WAS 3.5 QUARTS LOW ON OIL AND THE ENGINE HAD SHUT OFF TO \"PROTECT ITSELF\" . THE CAR HAS BEEN PARKED FOR IN MY GARAGE FOR 3 DAYS, AFTER DRIVING IT FOR ABOUT 3 MILES THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON, UPON CHECKING IT IS AGAIN LOW ON OIL. I HAVE HAD THE CAR SERVICED AS RECOMMENDED AND DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS SUDDEN OIL USE, THERE ARE NO SIGNS OF LEAKAGE OR SMOKING, AND THE WARNING SYSTEM IS NOT INDICATING LOW OIL PRESSURE.
