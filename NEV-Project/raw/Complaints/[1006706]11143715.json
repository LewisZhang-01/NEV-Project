        "summary": "THIS WAS A RENTAL VEHICLE, NOT MY PERSONAL VEHICLE, BUT IS APPLICABLE TO MULTIPLE BRANDS AND MODELS.  THE SAFETY ISSUE IS DUE TO THE HEADLIGHT MODES.  THE DEFAULT MODE IS OFF, YET THE DRL'S REMAIN ON.  THESE ARE BRIGHT ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN DRIVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND NOT REALIZE THAT YOUR ACTUAL HEADLIGHTS ARE OFF, WHICH MEANS THAT THE TAIL LIGHTS ARE OFF.  I HAVE BEEN SEEING SEVERAL VEHICLES EVERY DAY WITH PEOPLE DRIVING WITH NO LIGHTS ON, EVEN IN POOR VISIBILITY.  THE DEFAULT SHOULD BE FOR THE HEADLIGHTS TO BE IN AUTO MODE OR DRL'S MUST BE OFF WHEN YOU SELECT OFF.  I HAVE BEEN SURPRISED SEVERAL TIMES THIS FALL BY DRIVERS DRIVING EXCESSIVELY SLOW WITH THEIR LIGHTS OFF ON THE HIGHWAY IN THE RAIN AT NIGHT. YOU CANNOT SEE THEM TILL YOU ARE VERY CLOSE.  ALL OF THEM HAVE THESE NEW LED DRL'S ON AT THE TIME.  THIS IS A UNIVERSAL ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.  IT SHOWS A VERY BASIC LACK OF THOUGHT TO DESIGN HEADLIGHTS IN THIS WAY AND IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE IN MY OPINION.",
