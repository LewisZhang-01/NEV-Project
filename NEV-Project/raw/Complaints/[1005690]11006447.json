CANNOT MANUALLY UNLOCK THE CAR FROM THE INSIDE, BUT RATHER, HAVE TO OPEN THE WINDOW, REACH OUTSIDE THROUGH THE WINDOW AND INSERT KEY IN THE OUTSIDE DOOR LOCK, AND THEN CAUSE UNLOCK FROM THE KEY OUTSIDE.  PUT ASIDE THE FACT THAT IF WE DROPPED THE KEY OUTSIDE WHILE REACHING THROUGH THE WINDOW FROM THE INSIDE, WE WOULD BE WROUGHT WITH MORE PROBLEM - THE PRIMARY CONCERN IS THAT WE CANNOT ESCAPE THE VEHICLE IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY DUE TO THE DOOR LOCK PROBLEM.",
