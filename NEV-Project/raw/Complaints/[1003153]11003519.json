        "summary": "I PURCHASED MY LEXUS IN NOV. 2012 FOR APPROX. $18000 CASH FROM A PRIVATE PERSON. BY EARLY 2013, THE SRS AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT STAYED TO COME ON, STAY ON FOR 1-2 DAYS, THEN GOES OFF. THEN, FEW MONTHS LATER, IT CAME ON AND STAYED ON. SO, I TOOK IT TO A LEXUS DEALER TO CHECK IT. THEY IMMEDIATELY INFORMED ME THAT THE CAUSE WAS A DEFECTIVE SRS WIRE HARNESS, AS PER THE FAULT CODE B1861, WHICH LEXUS WAS WELL AWARE OF AND HAD ISSUED TSP, AND THE FIX WAS TO REPLACE THE SRS WIRE HARNESS WITH AN UPGRADED REPLACEMENT WHICH WOULD COST ME $3500-$4000. NOT BEING AWARE OF THIS ISSUE BEFORE I PURCHASED MY LEXUS, I DECIDED TO RESEARCH THE PROBLEM TO LEARN MORE BEFORE CONTACTING LEXUS CUSTOMER SATISFACTION CENTER, AS ADVISED BY THE DEALER.    HOWEVER, LEXUS CUSTOMER SATISFACTION CENTER, AS WELL AS LEXUS CORPORATE OFFICE, REFUSED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND CARRY THE ENTIRE COST, EVEN SO THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THE DEFECT.    THEREFORE, I'M LEFT WITH A CAR WITH NONFUNCTIONAL AIRBAG SYSTEM; IT WOULD COST ME AS MUCH AS 50% OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE CAR; IT COULD NOT BE RESOLD; AND, IT WOULD NOT PASS THE DMV INSPECTION.    ACCORDING TO ALL LEXUS DEALERS WHO INSPECTED THE PROBLEM, THIS SRS WIRE HARNESS IS LOCATED UNDER THE DASHBOARD AND CAN NOT BE DAMAGED EXCEPT DUE TO AN ACCIDENT WHERE DAMAGE REACHES THE DASHBOARD AREA. THEREFORE, IT'S LEXUS RESPONSIBILITY TO CARRY THE COST OF UPGRADING THE DEFECTED WIRE HARNESS. MOREOVER, THEY HAVE INFORMED THAT IT'S UNSAFE TO DRIVE THE CAR IN ITS CURRENT CONDITION BECAUSE THE AIRBAG SYSTEM MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY IN AN ACCIDENT. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE HIGH COST OF FIXING THIS PROBLEM, I AM, LIKE MANY OTHER LEXUS OWNERS, LEFT WITH NO CHOICE BUT TO DRIVE IT THE WAY IT IT AND PRAY I WON'T GET IN ANY ACCIDENT.",
