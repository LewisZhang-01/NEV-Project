THE NUMBERS ARE ON THE SPEEDOMETER HOWEVER, NOT ILLUMINATED AND IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE WHILE DRIVING.  THIS SHOULD BE BASIC INFORMATION WHILE DRIVING IN CANADA.  AS I UNDERSTAND IT, VEHICLES SOLD IN CANADA HAVE THE SAME ISSUE---NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE THE MPH WHEN DRIVEN IN THE US.  I WOULD THINK THAT BEING ABLE TO BE AWARE OF ONE'S SPEED WOULD BE A BASIC SAFETY FEATURE---HOWEVER---NOT ON A TOYOTA HIGHLANDER.",
