ON JULY 11, THE POWER STEERING COMPLETELY FAILED AND I TOOK IT TO A LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP IN CHESTERFIELD, MO.  THE DEALERSHIP COMMUNICATED TO ME THAT THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF POWER STEERING ISSUES WITH THIS CARE WHICH IS QUITE DISAPPOINTING SINCE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT CONTENT ON THE INTERNET FOR THIS ISSUE.  THE DIAGNOSIS IS FAULTY POWER STEERING ASSEMBLY AND WILL COST ME $2200 TO FIX.  I AM DISAPPOINTED FORD IS NOT TAKING THIS ISSUE MORE SERIOUSLY.  I AM LUCKY MY DAUGHTER WAS NOT INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT.",
