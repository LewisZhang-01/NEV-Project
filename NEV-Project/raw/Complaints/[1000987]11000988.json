THEY REPLACED MY BATTERY FOR $361.77, IN ORDER TO START THE CAR AND DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM. THEY CALLED THE NEXT DAY TO INFORM ME THAT I NEEDED A NEW ENGINE...FOR $9000.00!!! ON A CAR THAT WAS WELL MAINTAINED, WITH 60,000 MILES???? TOWED THE CAR TO MY MECHANIC WHO TOLD ME THAT THE A FAULTY SEAL CAUSED A ROD TO BREAK, AND THAT CAUSED THE ENGINE DAMAGE. HAD A NEW ENGINE INSTALLED FOR ABOUT $6000.00. I BELIEVE THAT GM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAULTY SEAL, AND THE POTENTIAL DAMAGE TO PROPERTY AND LIFE WHICH WOULD CAUSE A VEHICLE TO SUDDENLY STOP RUNNING...CAUSING THE BRAKES AND THE POWER STEERING TO STOP.",
