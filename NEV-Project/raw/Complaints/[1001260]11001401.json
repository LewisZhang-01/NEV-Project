WITHIN WEEKS OF THAT TIME A SECOND RECALL WAS RECEIVED FOR THE PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG WHICH IS NOW DATED 6/1/2016. IT HAS NOW BEEN OVER A YEAR AND NO UPDATE FOR THIS CURRENT RECALL AND FORD WILL NOT GRANT A LOANER VEHICLE UNTIL THE REPAIR IS MADE. MY WIFE WILL NOT RIDE IN THE VEHICLE UNTIL THE RECALL HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND OVER 1 YEAR FOR A SAFETY RECALL SEEMS VERY IRRESPONSIBLE. PLEASE HELP GET MY WIFE BACK INTO MY AUTOMOBILE. I LIVE IN ORLANDO FLORIDA WHERE HEAT AND HUMIDITY ARE ALSO CONSIDERED TO BE FACTORS IN THE AIR BAG FAILURES.",
