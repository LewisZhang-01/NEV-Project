Under the recall a Volvo dealer must do the replacement. The nearest Volvo dealer is 300 miles away.  Volvo will only reimburse for 25 miles of towing. The recall states \"If you are unable to have this procedure performed without charge....\".  Towing cost would be approximately $800.00.  How do I, and several others in my area, resolve this issue?",
