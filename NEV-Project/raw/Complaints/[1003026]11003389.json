I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR A NEW TRANSMISSION WHEN NISSAN KNEW ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION IN THESE VEHICLES. THEY SHOULD BE HOLD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND REPLACE ALL THE TRANSMISSIONS IN THESE VEHICLES AND PAY OTHER INDIVIDUALS BACK THEIR MONEY THAT HAS ALREADY PAID TO REPLACE THEIR TRANSMISSION.",
