IS IT OK TO HAVE A PASSENGER IN THE AFFECTED SEAT.  SAME ANSWER AS IN #1.  3.  WHEN WILL THE PART BECOME AVAILABLE? NO CLUE.  HE ACTUALLY SAID IT COULD BE YEARS SINCE TAKATA WAS BANKRUPT AND THEY WERE LOOKING FOR OTHER MANUFACTURERS TO MAKE THE PART.  THE NHTSA WEBSITE STATES RECALLS ARE ISSUED WHEN EQUIPMENT CREATES AN UNREASONABLE SAFETY RISK OR FAILS TO MEET MINIMUM SAFETY STANDARDS.  SINCE THE FORD DEALER STATED THAT THE NHTSA CLEARED VEHICLES UNDER THIS RECALL AS 'SAFE TO DRIVE', COULD I GET IT IN WRITING THAT MY VEHICLE IS SAFE TO DRIVE?  I ALSO LIVE IN FLORIDA WHERE THE 50% INCREASE IN PROBABILITY EXISTS DUE TO TEMP AND HUMIDITY.  ALSO, COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY ONLY THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG IS SUBJECT TO EXPLODING AND NOT THE DRIVERS SIDE.",
