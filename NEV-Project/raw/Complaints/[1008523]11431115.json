        "summary": "My problem: While i was leaving work returning to my apartment my car (2016 Nissan Altima S ~ 2.4L, 4 cylinder, 75k miles, Black) was operating fine nothing out of the ordinary. As I approached a stop sign and stop my car it was still acting normal. However, as i accelerated to take my turn i notice that my car wasn\u2019t moving normal it didn\u2019t accelerate pass 15 mph but the RPM was going up it went up to 5k RPM with no speed change it felt like i was on neutral. (No, I wasn\u2019t in neutral) it was on D i even placed the car in Ds to see if the problem was only on drive but the same problem occurred on Ds. As soon as i noticed that the car wasn\u2019t accelerating and after the person who was driving behind me got mad i moved my car to the break down lane. I powered cycled the car (turn it off and back on) and it was functioning correctly. My friend had the same problem occur to his car which is   Answer to Question: 1)I don\u2019t know which specific part is the problem. I do know this isn\u2019t the first case the same problem occurred on a 2015 Nissan Altima S i have a 2016 Nissan Altima S. This happened to the other car a few months prior to the date of my incident which happened August 30, 2021 at approximately 5pm.  Yes, it\u2019s available for inspection upon request.  2)My safety was put at risk because I couldn\u2019t accelerate properly to turn my car so I basically slowly cruised into traffic luckily i was able to steer to the side of the road. 3)No, it has not been reproduced or confirmed by a dealer. The problem is it happened suddenly with no warning of any problems. I only have 75k highway miles on the car with no lights, no accidents, only 5 years old and is in great shape. What makes it difficult to be reproduced is the fact that the problem randomly occurs and when the car goes through a power cycle the problem disappears and reoccurs randomly. 4)There were no warning lights and no problem prior to the car and it first occurred August 30, 2021 at approximately 5pm.",
