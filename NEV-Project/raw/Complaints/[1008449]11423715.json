        "summary": "The contact owns a 2015 KIA Soul. The contact stated that the vehicle was consuming a quart of engine oil for every 1,000 miles, without warning. The contact also stated that the coolant would evaporate without warning soon after refilling the coolant reservoir. The vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic who confirmed the oil consumption issue. The mechanic referred her to a dealer. The contact took the vehicle to an unknown dealer where an oil change was performed, and she was instructed to return every 1,000 miles to check the oil level. Upon checking the oil level after 1,000 miles, the contact became aware that the oil level had not changed. The contact was concerned that the dealer had overfilled the engine oil. After another 1,000 miles, she noticed that the vehicle had consumed another quart of oil. The manufacturer was not notified of the failure. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 91,000.",
