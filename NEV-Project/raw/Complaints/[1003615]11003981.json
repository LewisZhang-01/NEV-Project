AFTER THE SERVICE, A LOSS OF BRAKE PRESSURE WAS EXPERIENCED WHILE DRIVING. AFTER A FIGHT, BYERLY NISSAN REPLACED THE MASTER CYLINDER SAYING THAT WAS THE ISSUE. SINCE THEN, I'VE AGAIN LOST BRAKE PRESSURE. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS REGULARLY, WHICH MAKES IT MORE UNEXPECTED WHEN IT DOES HAPPEN. THIS IS DANGEROUS AND NEEDS TO BE RECALLED / ADDRESSED AS I'M SEEING MANY COMPLAINTS ONLINE WITH THE SAME ISSUE.",
