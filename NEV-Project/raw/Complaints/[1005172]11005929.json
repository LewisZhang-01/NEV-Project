        "summary": "ROUGE HAD RECALL WORK ON AIRBAG SENSOR DONE IN 2016.  HOWEVER OVER THE PAST MONTH OR SO, THE OFF INDICATOR FOR THE PASSENGER AIRBAG HAS BEEN LIT WHEN A PASSENGER OF 130 LBS HAS BEEN IN THE SET AT LEAST 4 DIFFERENT TIMES.    ONCE THE OFF INDICATOR LIGHT WENT OFF AFTER 1/4 MILE OF DRIVING.  THE OTHER TIMES, I HAD TO STOP THE VEHICLE AFTER DRIVING FOR LONGER DISTANCES, TURN IT OFF AND RESTART TO GET THE OFF INDICATOR TO GO OFF.  ONCE THE PASSENGER HAD TO GET OUT OF VEHICLE WHILE I TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF AND RESTARTED IN ORDER FOR LIGHT TO GO OFF WHEN THEY SAT BACK DOWN.    TOOK TO NISSAN DEALER AND THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM SO THEY RELEASED THE VEHICLE.   I DO NOT TRUST THE AIRBAG TO DEPLOY WHEN NEEDED SO I AM LOOKING TO TRADE THE VEHICLE IN ORDER TO PROTECT MY PASSENGER.....WHICH DOES NOTHING TO PROTECT  ANYONE IN THE FUTURE WHO RIDES IN THIS VEHICLE.    I AM NOT SURE OF WHAT THE AIRBAG RECALL LAST YEAR ACCOMPLISHED OR WHY NISSAN IS IGNORING THE COMPLAINTS SINCE THE RECALL WHEN THE RECALL STATED THE OCS SENSOR MAY BE FAULTY ON 3.2 MILLION VEHICLES.  EVIDENTLY THE OCS SENSOR IS STILL FAULTY BUT THE DEALER EXPECTS ME TO DRIVE IT LIKE THIS.",
