My vehicle was slowing down in the carpool lane and I had to carefully find my way to the shoulder to be able to turn the vehicle EV motor back on.  There are no warning signs. It is very sudden. This has happened 8 times so far. Dealership service center has inspected and tested the vehicle twice for a few weeks and has not been able to reproduce. My vehicle is available for more inspection but I just initiated a buy back process with Chrysler Customer Care.",
