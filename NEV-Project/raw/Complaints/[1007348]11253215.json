I ALMOST GET IN A ACCIDENT EVERYTIME I STOP AND TAKE OFF AGAIN. I HAVE TAKEN IT TO UNIVERSAL HYUNDAI 2 SEPARATE TIMES FOR THE SAME ISSUE AND THEY TOLD ME NOTHING IS WRONG WITH IT. IT IS SUPPOSE TO DO THAT. I DROVE 10 OTHER SUV THE SAME AS MINE AND HAD NO ISSUE AND HAD GOOD POWER. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AND ALMOST GOT INTO ABOUT 7 ACCIDENTS WITH IT BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE NO POWER OR VACUUM OR ANYTHING. IDK HOW TO EXPLAIN. IF I SLOW DOWN BUT NOT STOP THEN PUSH THE GAS TO GET SPEED AGAIN THE CAR BOUNCES LIKE IT IS MISS FIRING OR TRANSMISSION WENT BAD",
