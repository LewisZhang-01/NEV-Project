        "summary": "STEERING INTERMITTENTLY BECOMES HEAVY, MAKING VEHICLE HARDER TO CONTROL. TURNING THE CAR OFF AND BACK ON AGAIN CLEARS THE PROBLEM. IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE THE FEELING OF THE STEERING: YOU ARE ABLE TO TURN BUT IT FEELS LIKE THE CAR IS TRYING TO PREVENT YOU FROM TURNING THE WHEEL. THE PROBLEM SEEMS SOFTWARE-RELATED RATHER THAN A PHYSICAL FAILURE SINCE NOT ONLY IS IT INTERMITTENT, BUT IT IS INCONSISTENT. AT ONE INTERSECTION THE STEERING MAY BE NORMAL TURNING LEFT BUT HEAVY TURNING RIGHT AND THE SITUATION MAY BE REVERSED A MILE DOWN THE ROAD AT THE NEXT TURNING. I HAVE 28000 MILES/ 2.5YEARS ON THE CAR AND THE PROBLEM HAS ONLY STARTED OCCURRING WITHIN THE PAST MONTH. AT THE MOMENT THE PROBLEM OCCURS TOO RARELY TO TAKE THE CAR TO THE DEALER.",
