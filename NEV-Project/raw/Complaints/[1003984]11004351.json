        "summary": "HAD A VIBRATION PROBLEM WITH THIS 2015 SILVERADO 2500HD SINCE NEW SEPT. 2015 AT DIFFERING SPEEDS, FELT IN THE SEAT AND CENTER CONSOLE.  VIBRATION IS ON CITY STREETS, HIGHWAYS, ALL ROADS. CENTER CONSOLE HAS A VERY NOTICEABLE SHAKE TO IT. VIBRATION AT TIMES IS MODERATE, AT OTHER TIMES MORE SEVERE. AT 2500 MILES BROUGHT TO GWATNEY CHEVROLET IN JACKSONVILLE, AR.  THREE GOODYEAR TIRES REPLACED, ROAD FORCED BALANCED.  AT 11,000 MILES BROUGHT TO GWATNEY CHEVROLET TWO MORE GOODYEAR TIRES REPLACED, ROAD FORCED BALANCED.  IN GWATNEY NOTES, IT TOOK NINE TIRES TO FIND TWO GOOD TIRES TO PUT ON MY TRUCK.  AT 18,000 MILES RETURNED TO GWATNEY CHEVROLET, SERVICE MANAGER STATED THE PROBLEM WAS THE TIRES AND I WOULD HAVE TO PAY A PORTION OF THE COST.  MY RESPONSE WAS I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR A PROBLEM THAT THE TRUCK HAD SINCE IT WAS NEW.  THE SERVICE MANAGER WAS HOSTILE, ARGUMENTATIVE AND REFUSED TO DO ANY MORE WORK ON THE TRUCK.  I COMPLAINED TO GM CUSTOMER CARE, THEY WANTED TO GIVE ME $100 AND CLOSE THE CASE.  I ESCALATED MY COMPLAINT TO THE GM EXECUTIVE LEVEL, THEY APPEAR TO BE MORE ACCOMMODATING, THEY STATED THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE A GM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TEAM LOOK AT MY PROBLEM.  RIGHT NOW, I'M AWAITING FURTHER RESPONSE FROM GM.",
