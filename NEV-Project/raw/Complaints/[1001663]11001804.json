        "summary": "*TAKATA RECALL  I WAS INVOLVED IN A MAJOR CAR ACCIDENT DURING LUNCH HOUR ON THE 405 SOUTH FWY IN LOS ANGELES, CA.  I WAS STRUCK BY A SEMI TRUCK WHO WAS MERGING INTO MY LANE AND WHILE I TRIED TO GET OUT OF HIS WAY BY SPEEDING UP.  I WAS CLIPPED BY THE TRUCK AND MY CAR CAREENED INFRONT OF THE TRUCK AND WAS PUSHED BEFORE HE APPLIED HIS BRAKES.  MY CAR THEN SPUN OUT OF CONTROL ACROSS ALL FWY LANES.  I WAS HIT BY TWO OTHER ON COMING CARS BEFORE COMING TO A STOP IN THE CARPOOL LANE.  ALL CARS INCLUDING THE TRUCK WERE DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 65-70 MPH BASED ON THE POLICE REPORT.  MY FOOT WAS ON THE GAS THE ENTIRE TIME AS I SPUN OUT OF CONTROL.  MY COMPLAINT IS REGARDING THE AIRBAGS.  NONE OF THE SIDE OR FRONT AIRBAGS DEPLOYED AT THE TIME OF ALL IMPACTS.  I HAD THE VEHICLE INSPECTED BY AN INDEPENDANT INSPECTION COMPANY AFTER CONTACTING TOYOTA.  I HAVE YET TO HEAR BACK FROM TOYOTA EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE HAD THE REPORT FOR ALMOST TWO MONTHS.  I FINALLY RECEIVED THE REPORT FROM THE INSPECTOR AFTER THREATNING TO  HAVE MY ATTORNEY CONTACT THEM.  I DON'T KNOW HOW TO READ THE FINDINGS OF THE REPORT SINCE ITS ALL TECHNICAL ENGINEERING.  I AM ATTACHING THE REPORT AND HOPE THAT SOMEONE IN YOUR DEPARTMENT CAN REVIEW IT AND FOLLOWUP.    THANK YOU",
