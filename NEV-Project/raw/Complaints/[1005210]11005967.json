AFTER BUYING IT, IT BEGAN MISFIRING AND WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BAD FUEL INJECTORS, WHICH IS A NOTORIOUS PROBLEM FOR THE BMW N63 ENGINE. CERTAIN PRODUCTION DATES HAVE BEEN GIVEN AN EXTENDED LIMITED WARRANTY - MINE DID NOT. THE MANUFACTURER DID A \"CUSTOMER CARE PACKAGE\" VOLUNTARY RECALL, WHICH WAS PERFORMED ON MY CAR BUT DIDN'T FIX THE PROBLEM.  CONSIDERING THE PROBLEM WITH MY CAR IS A KNOWN DEFECT, I THINK BMW SHOULD STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT AND HAVE IT FIXED, AS IT PRESENTS A VALID SAFETY CONCERN.",
