IT MADE THE VEHICLE HARD TO BE RELIABLE. TOOK THE EXPLORER IN AND THEY SAID THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM FOR FORD VEHICLES AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHY THERE IS NO RECALL FOR IT BUT THE TRANSMISSION WAS SHOT NOW HAVING TO PAY $4500 OUT OF POCKET TO GET MY VEHICLE FIXED AS I NEED IT FOR DR APPOINTMENTS. THEY SAID THE O/D HAD PUT SHAVINGS DOWN IN THE PAN AS WELL AS OTHER PROBLEMS WITH THE TRANSMISSION AND IT WOULD COST MORE TO REPLACE INDIVIDUAL PARTS THAN TO DO THE ENTIRE THING. FRUSTRATING TO KNOW THAT FORD KNOWS THIS IS AN ISSUE AND DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP THE CONSUMER.",
