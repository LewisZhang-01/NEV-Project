TOYOTA SELLS VEHICLES WITH OUTDATED MAPS AND CHARGES OVER $200 FOR UPGRADES, WHICH DEALERS ARE RELUCTANT TO PROVIDE.  I CONSIDER ACCURATE MAPS A SAFETY CONCERN AND I SUGGEST THAT MAP UPDATES SHOULD BE PROVIDED ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS AT A NOMINAL (,$25) FEE.  THE GARMIN POLICY WOULD BE A BENCHMARK.  RIGHT NOW, MY GPS IS USELESS; CANNOT BE TRUSTED, AND MAY LEAD ME ASTRAY AS IT IS NOT CURRENT.  TIS IS A SAFETY ITEM.",
