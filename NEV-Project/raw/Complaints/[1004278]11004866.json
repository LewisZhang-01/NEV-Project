THIS VEHICLE ALWAYS HAS A UV PROTECTION VISOR UP WHEN NOT GARAGED AND THERE IS A HUGE CRACK ABOVE THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG WHICH IS VERY CONCERNING. THIS IS NOT SAFE AND WITH FLIMSY INTERIOR LIKE THIS, GMC HAS NO BUSINESS CHARGING THE PRICES THAT THEY DO FOR THEIR CARS. THIS PROBLEM IS ALL OVER THE INTERNET AND WE EVEN BOUGHT INTO AN EXTENDED BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY THAT THE DEALERSHIP IS SAYING WILL NOT COVER IT. THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN FOR ME AND ITS UNFORTUNATE THAT GM'S INTERIOR IS CHEAPLY MADE AND THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO HONOR THEIR VEHICLES WHEN THEY FALL APART. I TRADED IN A DODGE RAM THAT HAD IMMACULATE INTERIOR THAT NEVER CRACKED AND NOW I'M STUCK WITH A VEHICLE THAT IS FALLING APART.",
