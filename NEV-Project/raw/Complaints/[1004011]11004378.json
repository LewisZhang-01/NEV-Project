LEARNED OF IT WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS BROUGHT IN FOR TRADE-IN, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE VALUE OF WHAT THE TRADE-IN SHOULD HAVE BEEN.  THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN TO THE SAME TOYOTA SERVICE CENTER FOR 12 YEARS -- THEY NEVER MENTIONED IT.  TOYOTA HEADQUARTERS SAID THEY HAD NO RESPONSIBILITY TOWARDS THE ISSUE AND SUGGESTING BRINGING THE VEHICLE TO ANOTHER DEALER FOR TRADE-IN TO SEE IF THEY WOULD VALUE THE VEHICLE HIGHER IF THEY DIDN'T NOTICE.    A PRIVATE SALE WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE KNOWING THE RUST ISSUE NOW EXISTS.",
