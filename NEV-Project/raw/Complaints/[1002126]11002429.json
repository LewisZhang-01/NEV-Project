IT WAS WORKING GREAT UNTIL A FEW DAYS AGO I WENT TO GO START IT WHILE IT WAS IN MY DRIVEWAY AND IT WOULDN'T START. I HAD IT TOWED TO FIRST A MECHANIC WHERE I WAS TOLD THAT THE VALVES WERE BENT AND NO COMPRESSION WAS IN ANY OF MY CYLINDERS. I HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALER WHERE THEY CONFIRMED THAT MY TIMING CHAIN TENSIONER HAD FAILED CAUSING MASSIVE ENGINE DAMAGE. NO WARNINGS. NO INDICATORS. BUT A BILL FOR OVER $6,000 WHICH VOLKSWAGEN HAS ONLY TOLD ME TO \"KEEP RECEIPTS AND PROOF SHOULD THEY ISSUE A RECALL IN THE FUTURE.\"  VW IS IGNORING A MASSIVE FAULT IN THEIR ENGINES THAT MAKES THEIR TENSIONERS FAIL UNEXPECTEDLY AND PREMATURELY AND RUIN ENGINES WITHOUT THE DRIVER NEEDING TO HAVE MOVE THE VEHICLE AND THEY'RE DOING NOTHING TO WARN CONSUMERS OF THIS ISSUE.",
