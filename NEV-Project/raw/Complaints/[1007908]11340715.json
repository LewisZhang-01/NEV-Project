FIRST THE ORIGINAL SUBARU BATTERY,  THEN A BETTER DELCO  REPLACED THAT, THEN ANOTHER BETTER DELCO, NOW ANOTHER. ONLY 27,000 PLUS MILES.  I HAVE NEEDED TO HAVE THIS BATTERY JUMPED ONCE BEFORE AND THE PREVIOUS BATTERIES WERE JUMPED A TOTAL OF 5 TIMES.    THE NHTSA WEBSITE HAS NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT BATTERY FAILURE FOR THIS MAKE/MODEL  AND OTHER SUBARU OUTBACKS BUT NO RECALLS. WHY NOT?    THIS IS ALSO A SAFETY ISSUE!  I AM TOLD THAT \"SOMETHING\" IN THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS IS DRAWING DOWN THE BATTERY BUT IT CANNOT BE FOUND. THERE IS A FLAW SOMEWHERE.    NOTHING WAS LEFT ON.   SUBARU OF AMERICA HAS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS. REALLY",
