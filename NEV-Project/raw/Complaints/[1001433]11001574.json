        "summary": "OUR YUKON HAS A CRACK ON THE CORNER OF THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG, AND ALSO A VERY LARGE CRACK ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL HUMP OF THE DASH.  THIS CRACK CONTINUES TO LENGTHEN DAILY.  WE HAVE REAL FEARS OF THE PLASTIC BREAKING APART INTO SHARP SHARDS IN THE CASE OF AN ACCIDENT.  I WORRY ABOUT MY TEENAGERS RIDING IN THE FRONT SEAT AS I DON'T WANT THEM INJURED.    ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE CRACK NEAR THE AIRBAG BREAKING THE DASH INTO PIECES IF THE AIRBAG INFLATES.    WE RECEIVED THE TAKATA AIRBAG RECALL OVER A YEAR AGO, AND ARE STILL WAITING FOR REPLACEMENT.    WE ARE MEMBERS OF A FACEBOOK GROUP WITH 6,200+ MEMBERS, ALL WITH CRACKS IN GM VEHICLES IN THE EXACT LOCATION.  GM DENIES THAT THIS IS A DEFECTIVE PART AND TRIES TO BLAME THE ISSUE ON CAR BEING IN THE HOT SUN, USE OF ARMOR ALL, ETC...  BUT IT SEEMS TO ME IF EVERYONE HAS THE EXACT SAME ISSUE, IT'S A MANUFACTURING DEFECT.    WE ALSO OWN A 2008 GMC YUKON DENALI XL WITH AN IDENTICAL CRACK AT THE AIRBAG CORNER.",
