        "summary": "2014 FORD F150 ECOBOOST NO POWER. I WAS STOPPED IN CENTER TURN LANE WAITING TO TURN LEFT ACROSS ON COMING HIGHWAY TRAFFIC. AFTER IT WAS SAFE TO CROSS I PRESS THE ACCELERATOR I DISCOVERED MY F150 HAD NOT POWER. GAS PEDAL HAD NO RESPONSE. TRUCK WOULD ONLY MOVE AT IDEAL SPEED.  VERY CLOSE TO GETTING T-BONED.  THE SERVICE WRENCH SHOWED UP ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL.  THE TRUCK HAD A VERY ROUGH IDEAL AS I CREEPED OFF THE HIGHWAY.   I HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO THE DEALER THAT HAD JUST REPAIRED THE TIMING CHAIN AND CAM SHAFT PHASERS THE WEEK PRIOR.  DEALER RAN SEVERAL TESTS AND FOUND NO CODES.  THEY DECIDED TO REPLACE THE THROTTLE BODY AND MOTOR ASSEMBLY AFTER CHECKING OASIS AND FOUND MULTIPLE HOTLINE CONTACTS WITH SIMILAR CONCERNS.  WHEN PULLING TRUCK INTO SERVICE BAY THE THROTTLE BODY STUCK PARTIALLY CLOSED.  I WAS VERY LUCKY TO NOT GET HIT BY ANOTHER CAR WHEN THIS HAPPENED TO ME. YOUTUBE VIDEO (2014-11-02 -2013 F150 LIMP MODE) BY MIKE WILES SHOWS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY TRUCK. PLEASE HAVE FORD RECALL THIS PART BEFORE SOMEONE DIES.",
