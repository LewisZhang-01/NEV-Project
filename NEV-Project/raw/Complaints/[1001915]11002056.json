I NEED TO TURN ENGINE OFF WHILE IN TRAFFIC AND RESTART IN ORDER TO GET BACK INTO GEAR.   THE VIN SEARCH SHOWS NO RECALL, BUT THE SAME SAFETY ISSUE HAS CAUSED ISSUES WHEN I GET OUT AND PUSH THE VEHICLE OFF THE ROAD.  MOST OF THE ISSUE HAPPEN WHEN STARTING FROM A SLOW START.  THE ENGINE REVS BUT WILL NOT MOVE, BOTH AT TRAFFIC LIGHTS, DURING STOP AND GO COMMUTES. ONCE IT GOES, IT HAS NOT SLIPPED OUT OF GEAR.",
