WHILE GM CONSIDERS THE VEHICLE SAFE TO DRIVE, THE SAFETY RISK DESCRIPTION STATES: \"THE PROPELLANT IN SOME TYPES OF TAKATA AIRBAG INFLATORS CAN DEGRADE OVER TIME, ESPECIALLY AFTER LONG TERM EXPOSURE IN HOT AND HUMID REGIONS. IF THE PROPELLANT DEGRADES TO A CERTAIN LEVEL, THE INFLATORS MAY RUPTURE DURING DEPLOYMENT, CAUSING SERIOUS OR FATAL INJURIES\".  THIS DOES NOT SOUND SAFE TO ME, ESPECIALLY SINCE I LIVE IN SUGAR LAND, TX WHERE THERE ARE LONG PERIODS OF HIGH HEAT AND HUMIDITY WHICH EFFECTS THE AIRBAG DEGRADATION. CAN ANYONE HELP FINALIZE THE SITUATION AND GET THIS RECALL TAKEN CARE OF?  THANK YOU! [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).'*JB",
