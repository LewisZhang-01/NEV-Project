THIS HAPPENS USUALLY AT THE SAME 5 PLACES, 3 OF THEM WHEN SLOWING TO MAKE A RIGHT HAND TURN IN AN S TURN AND THE OTHER 2 GOING STRAIGHT SLOWING TO STOP TO MAKE A LEFT TURN ACROSS TRAFFIC. I FEEL LIKE IT'S A COMBINATION OF BRAKING, STEERING WHEEL AND WHEN ITS SHIFTING INTO 1ST SINCE I'M EITHER IN A STOPPING SITUATION OR S TURN SITUATION. WHEN THIS HAPPENS I LOOSE STEERING AND BRAKES CAUSING ME TO GO INTO THE OPPOSITE LANE OF TRAVEL HEAD ON. THERE HAVE BEEN RECALLS ON THE ALTERNATOR FOR MY VEHICLE BUT MINE HAS NEVER BEEN INCLUDED. THERE HAS BEEN A RECALL FOR A SENSOR THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETED BUT DID NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE, MY CHANCE FOR A HEAD ON COLLISION IS VERY VERY SCARY. THIS HAPPENS ABOUT 6-10 TIMES A WEEK.",
