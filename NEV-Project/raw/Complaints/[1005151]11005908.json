        "summary": "2014 JAYCO FLIGHT SWIFT SLX 154BH VIN [XXX]. I BOUGHT THIS NEW FROM NORTH TRAIL RV, FORT MYERS, FL. THIS IS MY FIRST TRAVEL TRAILER, AND EXPERIENCED A LEARNING CURVE. HAD A GOOD HITCH WITH PROPER SWAY BARS.   AFTER TAKING CROSS COUNTRY TRIP IN 2015-16, NOTICED TIRE WEAR WAS ABNORMAL. PLANNED TO REPLACE THEM BEFORE NEXT TRIP. NEXT TRIP COMING UP. IN SHOPPING FOR REPLACEMENT TIRES, I'VE DISCOVERED THE TWO ORIGINAL TIRES FROM JAYCO (GRAND RIDE POWER TOURING ST175 80R 13 LOAD RANGE C- 6PLY -RATED TO CARRY 1360 @ 50PSI EACH) WERE RATED INSUFFICIENT TO CARRY THE LISTED GVWR OF 3200LBS. THE NET WEIGHT OF THE TRAILER IS LISTED AS 2455 LB. I CONTACTED JAYCO ABOUT THIS DISCREPANCY. THE FIRST PERSON AGREED THAT THE TIRE RATING WAS FOR ONLY 1360 EACH TIRE, TWO (2) TIRES EQUALING 2720. LBS, WHICH WOULD BE SUFFICIENT RATING. THE SPECS CALL FOR ADDITIONAL WEIGHT APPX 755 LBS. THAT WEIGHT BRINGS THE LOAD UP TO APPX 3200LBS.  JAYCO REP SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE THOSE TIRES ANYMORE AND GAVE ME A PART # TO REPLACE TIRES AND RIMS AT A LOCAL DEALER. WHEN I ASKED WHY THEY WOULD BE SELLING AN UNDERRATED TIRE ON THEIR TRAILERS, THEY RESPONDED WITH \"THE NHTSA HAD NEVER RECEIVED A COMPLAINT, SO THEY MUST BE OK\"?  SOMETHING IS WRONG THAT JAYCO CONTINUES TO SELL TIRES UNDERRATED FOR THEIR TRAVEL TRAILERS.  I WILL CONTINUE TO SHOP FOR PROPERLY RATED TIRES AND CONSIDER MYSELF LUCKY THAT NOTHING HAPPENED ON MY LAST LONG TRIP.
