STEPPING ON THE ACCELERATOR CAUSES THE TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT TO BLINK AND THE ENGINE TO EFFECTIVELY STALL OUT FOR A FEW SECONDS. WHEN THE THROTTLE DOES ENGAGE AFTER THE HESITATION, IT IS IN A VIOLENT MANNER. THIS HAPPENS MORE FREQUENTLY THAN NOT, AND IS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS.    I'VE OWNED THIS VEHICLE FOR OVER A YEAR AND HAVE 20,000+ MILES ON IT. THIS IS A REOCCURRING ISSUE. HAD I BEEN AWARE OF THIS SITE, I WOULD'VE FILED A COMPLAINT IMMEDIATELY.",
