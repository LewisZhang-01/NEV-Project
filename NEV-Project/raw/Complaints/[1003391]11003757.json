THEY GOT THE NEW PART IN AND TRIED TO PROGRAM IT AND \"FRIED\" THE PART. AFTER TRYING 13 UNITS I WAS TOLD THAT THERE IS A DEFECT IN THE PART AND THAT GM WAS SENDING 2 ENGINEERS TO MEXICO TO INVESTIGATE THE FACTORY WHERE THEY ARE MADE. IT WAS THEN DETERMINED THAT IT IS NOW A SOFTWARE ISSUE THAT GM CHANGED THE SOFTWARE OVER 1 1/2 YEARS AGO AND UPLOAD PROCEDURE AND WAS NOW LOOKING TO SEE WHERE THE PROBLEM IS. IT HAS NOW BEEN 6 WEEKS SINCE MY CAR HAS BEEN IN THE SHOP AND I HAVE NO ESTIMATION AS TO WHEN THE PROBLEM WILL BE SOLVED. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT THERE ARE AS AMNY AS 10 TO 20 CARS AROUND THE US WITH THE SAME PROBLEM AND ARE UNREAPAIRABLE AT THIS TIME. IT IS OBVIOUS THAT GM KNEW THEY HAD A PROBLEN SINCE THEY CHANGED THE PROCEDURE 1 1/2 YEARS AGO SINCE MY CAR IS NOT THE FIRST TO EXPERIENCE THIS.",
