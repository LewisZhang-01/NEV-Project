        "summary": "MY CAR DOES NOT GIVE ANY AUDIO ALERT WHEN I SHUT OFF THE CAR AND HAVE IT IN GEAR.  MY CAR ROLLED AWAY FROM PARKING SPOT AND HIT ANOTHER CAR WHEN I WAS NOT IN IT.  PER AGAIN, A TRADITIONAL KEY CANNOT BE REMOVED FROM THE IGNITION UNTIL THE VEHICLE IS IN 'PARK.' FMVSS 114 IS QUITE CLEAR ON THIS POINT: SINCE 1992, THE STANDARD HAS REQUIRED VEHICLES WITH AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS THAT HAVE A PARK POSITION TO HAVE A KEY-LOCKING SYSTEM THAT PREVENTED REMOVAL OF THE KEY UNLESS THE TRANSMISSION WAS LOCKED IN PARK OR BECAME LOCKED IN PARK AS THE DIRECT RESULT OF REMOVING THE KEY.  THIS IS A PUSH START AND IT DOES NOT BEEP OR ANYTHING LETTING ME KNOW IT IS NOT IN PARK.  THE GEAR SHIFTIER DOES NOT SHOW WHAT GEAR IT IS IN.  NHTSA IS PURPORTING TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS WITH A NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING, PUBLISHED IN DECEMBER 2011, WITH A NEW RELIANCE ON AUDIBLE WARNINGS, BASED ON THOSE ALREADY REQUIRED IN FMVSS 403 (WHEELCHAIR LIFTS).  THE AGENCY OFFERED NO HUMAN FACTORS RESEARCH TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THESE WARNINGS WOULD BE EFFECTIVE.  I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPEN IN THE DECEMBER 2011 REGARDING CARS HAVING THE AUDIO ABLE WARNING TO LET DRIVERS KNOW. I AM HAPPY THAT NO ONE WAS HURT ONLY MY CAR AND THE OTHER CAR BUT THIS COULD OF KILLED SOMEONE WALKING BY AND THAT IS WHY THE WAS WAS PUT IN PLACE.  HONDA SAYS IT PUTS A MESSAGE ON THE SCREEN WHEN YOU SHUT IT OFF, DID NOT SEE THAT MESSAGE AS I WAS EXITING THE CAR THAT IS WHY THERE SHOULD BE A AUDIO SOUND.",
