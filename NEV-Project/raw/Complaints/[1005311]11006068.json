THE LETTER (ATTACHED) NOTIFIED ME THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE AIR BAG WAS DEFECTIVE AND DANGEROUS.  THE LETTER SAID THAT TOYOTA WAS SEEKING A REMEDY AND IN THE MEANTIME I SHOULD NOT USE THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE. I HAVE HEARD NOTHING SINCE. SO I HAVE EFFECTIVELY BEEN DENIED FULL USE OF MY CAR FOR MONTHS. THIS IS NOT REASONABLE. MY ELDERLY MOTHER IS COMING TO LIVE WITH ME. I NEED USE OF THE PASSENGER SEAT. IS TOYOTA PREPARED TO PAY FOR A RENTAL OR OFFER SOME OTHER COMPENSATION?",
