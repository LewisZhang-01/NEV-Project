WE ARE DRIVING THIS CAR WITH A DANGEROUS PART IN IT AND TOYOTA HAS NOT CONTACTED US ABOUT THE PROBLEM SINCE LAST YEAR WHEN THEY SAID THEY WOULD CONTACT US SOON WITH A TIME FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS AIRBAG.  THEY HAVE NOT CONTACTED US SINCE, AND IT'S GOING ON 14 MONTHS NOW.  WE WOULD LIKE SOME HELP TO GET TOYOTA TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND REPLACE OUR AIRBAG AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. THIS CAR IS EXPOSED TO HIGH LEVELS OF HEAT AS IT IS PARKED IN AN OUTDOOR PARKING LOT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DURING WORK DAYS.",
