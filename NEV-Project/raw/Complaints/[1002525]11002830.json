        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING HOME FROM A FAMILY REUNION LAST NIGHT AT 11PM ON THE HIGHWAY WHICH IS 65-80MPH AND NO STREET LIGHTS WHATSOEVER,  WITH MY TWO YEAR OLD SON AND FIANC IN THE CAR AND OUT OF NOWHERE THE VEHICLE HAD COMPLETELY WENT HAYWIRE AND SHUT DOWN. MY LIGHTS WENT OUT INCLUDING EXTERIOR LIGHTING AND THE GAUGES WENT BLACK AND WIPERS AND HEAT WERE GOING CRAZY. I THEN PANICKED BECAUSE I HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH A THING AND TRIED TO GET OFF THE HIGHWAY AS SOON AS I COULD WITHOUT BEING HIT BY THE SEMI THAT WATCHED MY CAR GO DARK AND TRIED TO PREVENT AN ACCIDENT BY PUTING ON HIS HAZARDS AND FOLLOWING ME. I HAD NO BREAKS NO TRACTION CONTROL AND NO POWER STEERING, MAKING IT EXTREMELY DIFICULT TO FINALLY GET THE CAR AT REST. I WAS TERRIFIED FOR MY FAMILY AND I'S SAFETY AS MY CARS MALFUNCTION COULD HAVE CAUSED A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT AND DEATHS...I THEN BEGAN TO LOOK UP WHY MY CAR HAD DONE WHAT IT DID AND IT SEEMS THAT MULTIPLE PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL AND STILL NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE FOR ANY OF US WHO HAD WENT THROUGH THIS DISTRESS. I HOPE TO GET ALL OF THIS FIGURED OUT ASAP. NO CAR WITH THESE PROBLEMS SHOULD BE ON THE STREET. MY TWO YEAR OLD SHOULD NEVER HAD WITNESSED SOMETHING FOR TERRIFYING.",
