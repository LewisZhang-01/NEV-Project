        "summary": "FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT UP UNTIL NOW I LOVED MY KIA!!!! UNFORTUNATELY BEGINNING JUST BEFORE THE CAR HAD 100,000 MILES ON IT, THE CAR BEGAN TO BURN OIL. IT IS BURNING APPROXIMATELY 1 QUART EVERY 1000 MILES. I TOOK THE CAR IN TO THE DEALER FOR THE LATEST ENGINE RECALL AND WHILE THERE I COMMUNICATED WITH THE DEALERSHIP THAT THE CAR HAS BEEN BURNING OIL AT THE RATE OF A QUART EVERY 1000 MILES. THE DEALERSHIP CHANGED MY  OIL WHEN CHECKING IT FOR THE ENGINE RECALL, AFTERWARDS THEY DIRECTED ME TO BRING IT BACK IN AT 1000 MILES. THE CAR IS CURRENTLY AT THE DEALERSHIP NOW FOR THIS CHECK. THE CAR IS AT 900 MILES AND A QUART LOW. I HOPE KIA WILL DO THE RIGHT THING AND FIX THIS. I HAVE READ OTHER PEOPLES EXPERIENCES WITH THE ENGINE FAILURE AND ONE OF THE COMMON SYMPTOMS SEEMS TO BE THE CAR SUDDENLY BEGINNING TO BURN OIL. I DO NOT WANT TO BE  ON THE INTERSTATE AND SUDDENLY HAVE ENGINE FAILURE IN AND NOT BE ABLE TO GET MY CAR OUT OF THE LINE OF TRAFFIC.",
