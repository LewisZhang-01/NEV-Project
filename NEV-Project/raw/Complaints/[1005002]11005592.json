THIS CONDITION ALSO OCCURRED ON MY 2008 HYUNDAI TUCSON FOR WHICH THERE WAS A RECALL.  THE PROBLEM WAS REPAIRED ON 5/23/2013 AT ADVANTAGE HYUNDAI IN HICKSVILLE, NY.  ATTACHED TO THIS COMPLAINT IS THE RECALL NOTICE FOR THE 2008 TUCSON AND THE REPAIR RECEIPT OF 5/23/13. I INQUIRED ON 6/25/2017 AS TO WHETHER THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THE 2006 TUCSON I OWN AND WAS INFORMED THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY NOT AN OPEN RECALL FOR THIS CONDITION. IT IS APPARENT TO ME THAT THIS ISSUE ALSO AFFECTS 2006 HYUNDAI  MODELS ALSO. I AM REQUESTING YOUR ASSISTANCE IN OPENING AN INVESTIGATION REGARDING MY 2006 HYUNDAI TUCSON AND FOR THIS MODEL TO BE INCLUDED IN THE AFFECTED GROUP AND FOR HYUNDAI TO CORRECT THE ISSUE ON MY VEHICLE.",
