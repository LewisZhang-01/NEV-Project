THE TWO SPRING LOADED METAL CLASPS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR SEAT GOT STUCK ON THE METAL LATCHES ON THE BASE OF THE CAR SEAT. THE CAR SEAT WILL NOT DETACH FROM THE BASE. THIS SCARED ME INTO PURCHASING A NEW CAR SEAT BECAUSE IF I WERE TO GET INTO A CAR ACCIDENT, I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EASILY DETACH THE CAR SEAT FROM THE BASE. I WOULD HAVE HAD TO UNBUCKLE THE SEAT BELT AND PULL THE ENTIRE CAR SEAT OUT, BASE AND ALL.",
