AUTOMATIC SHIFT SEEMS TO BE LOCKED.  4TH OF JULY WEEKEND, LONG WAIT FOR TOW TRUCK TO DEALER.  NO SERVICE PEOPLE THERE.  I WAS GIVEN A SHEET OF PAPER SHOWING A RECALL THAT HAS NOT BEEN DISTRIBUTED YET FOR 2013-2016 ACCORDS.  THE CASE FOR THE BATTERY SENSOR MOUNTED AT THE TOP OF THE 12V BATTERY MAY HAVE BEEN IMPROPERLY MANUFACTURED WITH GAPS THAT COULD ALLOW FOR MOISTURE ENTRY, IF MOISTURE CONTAINING ROAD SALT, OR OTHER CONDUCTIVE SUBSTANCE,ENTERS THE BATTERY SENSOR, IT COULD RESULT IN AN ELECTRICAL SHORT AND SUBSEQUENTLY, A FIRE.  REFRAIN FROM CALLING TECH LINE FOR UPDATES. THE FACT IS  I AM A WOMAN AND I BUY A  NEW OR LEASE A NEW CAR EVERY THREE OR SO YEARS SO THAT I WON'T BE LEFT SOMEWHERE STRANDED AND IN DANGER.  ANYTIME A WOMAN IS HELPLESS IN A NON WORKING CAR, DANGER IS THE FIRST ISSUE.  SORRY, BUT WE DO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE WORLD IS DIFFERENT FOR MEN AND WOMEN.  HONDA SERVICE BULLETIN 17-057  THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE ACCORDING TO THE BULLETIN FOR 2013-2016",
