        "summary": "2005 BMW Z4 STEERING STICKS WHILE DRIVING AT LOW OR HIGH SPEED. WHEN PARKED WITH STEERING UNLOCKED YOU CAN ROTATE THE STEERING WHEEL AND FEEL THERE IS A STICKING ISSUE THAT YOU HAVE TO FORCIBLY PUSH THE WHEEL TOO FAR TO GET IT TO UNSTICK. THIS IS VERY SCARY WHEN DRIVING! CONSUMERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY TO FIX THIS SINCE MANY OWNERS HAVE THIS PROBLEM. DEALERSHIPS WANT $3500 TO FIX THE ISSUE.   I DRIVE A LOT FOR WORK, GOING INTO A TURN ON THE HIGHWAY AT HIGH SPEEDS AND YOUR STEERING IT STUCK IS VERY DANGEROUS. THIS HAPPENS TO ME EVERYTIME I DRIVE THE CAR.  I SEARCHED THE INTERNET AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THREADS FROM EVERYONE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM. I ONLY DRIVE THIS CAR IN THE SUMMER SO I CANNOT SAY IF THE PROBLEM IS WORSE IN WARM WEATHER. ALL I CAN TRULY SAY IS THIS HAPPENS EVERYTIME I DRIVE THE CAR. WHETHER SHORT TRIP TO STORE AT LOW CITY SPEEDS OR VERY HIGH SPEEDS ON THE HIGHWAY. WHY IS THE NHTSA IGNORING THIS? STEERING NOT WORKING IS A HUGE SAFETY DEFECT! THIS IS NOT AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM, IT IS CONSTANT AND RANDOM SO NO WAY TO PREPARE BEFORE IT HAPPENS AT 80 MPH OR 35 MPH THROUGH CITY STREETS WITH PEDESTRIANS AND CARS EVERYWHERE.  THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE FOR AS LONG AS I'VE OWNED THE CAR AND EVERY YEAR IT GETS WORSE.",
