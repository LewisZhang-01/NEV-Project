        "summary": "OWNER OF A 2012 FORD FOCUS 4D SE, EXPERIENCED THE LOSS OF POWER STEERING \"POWER STEERING ASSIST\". IT HAS HAPPENED TO ME TWICE WITHIN MINUTES OF EACH OTHER. GOING DOWN A CITY STREET AND LOST CONTROL IT WAS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO TURN TO GET OFF THE STREET TO SAFETY. IN THE PROCESS OF TURNING I CAME CLOSE TO HITTING A CAR. TURNED THE CAR ON AND OFF, FIGURED WORKS FOR ELECTRONIC DEVICES, THE \"POWER STEERING ASSIST\" WAS REMOVED THEN 10 MINUTES LATER THE \"POWER STEERING ASSIST\" ENGAGED AGAIN THIS TIME TURNING OFF THE FREEWAY. VERY SCARY EXPERIENCE. AFTER READING THE COST TO CORRECT THE ISSUE I WILL BE OUT $2000.00. IS FORD PUTTING LIVES IN DANGER TO CREATE ANOTHER REVENUE STREAM?? I CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE VEHICLES HAVE NOT BEEN RECALLED FOR THIS ISSUE!!!!  57K MILES",
