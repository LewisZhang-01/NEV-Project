I AM TOLD IF I SMELL GAS TO DRIVE IT TO THE DEALER TO GET LOOKED AT.    ALTHOUGH I DON'T CURRENTLY SMELL GAS, MY CONCERN IS THE POTENTIAL FOR FIRE SHOULD IT START TO LEAK.   CONSIDER MY 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IS STRAPPED INTO HER CAR SEAT IN THE REAR SEAT.  UNDER HER ARE THE FUEL FILTERS IN QUESTION WHICH POTENTIALLY LEAK.  UNDER THE FUEL FILTERS IS THE HOT EXHAUST.    MY CONCERN IS WHAT TIMEFRAME DO I HAVE FROM THE TIME I SMELL GAS, TO THE TIME IT COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE HOT EXHAUST AND POSSIBLY IGNITES?  WHAT HAPPENS IF I SMELL GAS IN GRIDLOCK TRAFFIC - IS THERE ENOUGH RISK THAT I SHOULD IMMEDIATELY GET MY DAUGHTER OUT OF THE CAR?  OR SHOULD I CONTINUE DRIVING TO THE DEALER AS VW RECOMMENDS AND RISK US CATCHING ON FIRE ON THE WAY THERE?    WHILE VW IS RECOGNIZING THE PROBLEM, THEY SEEM TO BE DRAGGING THEIR FEET ON RESOLUTION TO WHAT IS POTENTIALLY A LIFE THREATENING ISSUE.",
