THE BRAKE LIGHT CAME ON IMMEDIATELY AND LOW BRAKE FLUID LIGHT WAS ALSO ON.    THE FORD DEALER CONFIRMED UPON REPAIR THAT THE MASTER CYLINDER DUMPED MOST OR ALL OF MY BRAKE FLUID INTO THE BRAKE BOOSTER. THEY REPAIRED THE ISSUE, BUT USED THE SAME FACTORY PARTS MY TRUCK WAS MADE WITH. WHAT'S TO SAY THIS WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN???",
