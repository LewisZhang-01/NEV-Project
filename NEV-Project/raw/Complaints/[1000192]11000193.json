WHILE DRIVING ON A CALIFORNIA FREEWAY   A ROCK HIT MY FRONT WINDSHIELD AT THE TOP RIGHT CORNER WHICH CAUSED A LONG STRESS CRACK ACROSS THE WINDOW. I CONTACTED THE DEALER AND THEY TELL ME THEY WON'T COVER IT. I'M INSURED. THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. I WONDER IF THIS HAS BEEN REPORTED BY ANYONE ELSE WHO OWNS A FORD?. MY TOYOTA HAS BEEN HIT MANY TIMES AND HARDER THAN WHAT THIS ROCK DID BUT IT HAS NEVER SHOWN A FRACTURE LIKE THIS. PLEASE ADVISE. I CAN ALSO SEND PICS.     A GLASS REPAIR COMPANY LOOKED AT IT AND ALSO TOLD ME THAT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.",
