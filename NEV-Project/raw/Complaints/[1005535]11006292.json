TOOK CAR TO UNIVERSAL CITY NISSAN, BUT THEY DID NOT SERVICE IT. THEY DID INDICATE THAT THE SENSOR IS FAULTY AND DOES NEED REPAIR. AND ESTIMATE$1200 TO REPAIR. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND, IT SEEMS A SAFTY MATTER, AND I BELIEVE IT SHOUL BE COVERED BY MY WARRANTY. PLEASE HELP ME FIND OUT WHY I HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND WORRIED IF THIS SAFETY DEVICE WILL NOT CAUSE INJURY, OR AND ACCIDENT,OR ACCIDENTAL DEPLOYMENT. THE LIGHTS WERE RESET BY NISSAN, BUT AS I DROVE A BLOCK, THE LIGHT ACTIVATED WITH AN ADULT IN THE SEAT. I WANT NISSAN TO PUT IT IN WRITEING, IF THEY CAN REASURE ME THAT THIS IS NOT A SAFTY ISSUE. AND ASSURE ME THAT THERE IS NO DANGER OF AIRDAGS BEING DEFECTIVE. IF THERE IS A WARNING LIGHT, THEN THERE EXISTS A PROBLEM.",
