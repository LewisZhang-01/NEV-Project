        "summary": "\"TAKATA RECALL\"  IN JULY 2016 I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE ON MY 2008 AVALANCHE TAKATA AIRBAG.  IN JUNE 2017 A SERVICE AIR BAG LIGHT CAME ON. I CALLED THE DEALER   (WILLIAMS CHEVROLET) IN ELKTON MARYLAND AND THEY TOLD ME THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE FIX.  I CALLED CHEVROLET CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS TOLD THE SAME THING.  I WAS TOLD BY BOTH PARTIES THE RECALL DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING THAT I HAD TO PAY FOR THE FIX.  I TOLD BOTH PARTIES THAT I FELT IF THERE WAS A RECALL ON THIS AIRBAG AND A SERVICE AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON IT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO REPLACE AND FIX MY AIRBAG UNDER THE RECALL AT NO COST TO ME.  I CALLED ONSTAR A WAS TOLD THAT IT SHOULD BE FIXED IMMEDIATELY.  THE RECALL NOTICE STATES THE AIRBAG INFLATORS IT SUPPLIED TO GM ARE DEFECTIVE AND MAY RUPTURE DURING DEPLOYMENT CAUSING SERIOUS OR FATAL INJURIES.  THE TRUCK HAS LESS THAN 93000 MILES ON IT.  I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY HELP YOU CAN GET ME ON THIS MATTER.  THANKS,  [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
