        "summary": "2009 HONDA CIVIC NEVER IN AN ACCIDENT. IN FEB 2019 HE AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON. FRONT AIRBAGS WERE PREVIOUSLY REPLACED UNDER TAKITA RECALL. I WAS TOLD THE PASSENGER SEAT SIDE AIRBAG HAD TO BE REPLACED FOR \"A PART THAT JUST FAILS OVER TIME\" AND WAS NOT PART OF THE RECALL. I PAID $1100 TO HAVE IT REPLACED. TWO MONTHS LATER AND  THE AIRBAG LIGHT IS ON AGAIN AND I FEAR IT IS NOW THE DRIVER SIDE CURTAIN AIRBAG THAT HAS FAILED AND I WILL HAVE TO PUT ANOTHER $1100 INTO A CAR FOR FAILURE OF A SAFETY PART. THE CAR HAS 112,000 MILES AND I JUST PAID AN ADDITIONAL $1400 FOR REAR BREAKS, SHOCKS, ETC., WHICH I CONSIDER ROUTINE MAINTENANCE. I COULD HAVE PUT  $3600 DOWN ON A NEW CAR. NOW I AM ALREADY INTO THIS CAR FOR $2500 AND FIXING THE AIRBAG IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. IT NEEDS TO BE DONE. I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE HAVING SIDE AIRBAG ISSUES WITH HONDA VEHICLES. ALSO, THE PAINT IS PEELING OFF THE VEHICLE! STARTED PEELING 6 MONTHS AFTER THE WARRANTY WAS UP SO HONDA NOT RESPONSIBLE.",
