        "summary": "WE HAVE A GRACO AFFIX HIGH BACK BOOSTER (MODEL #1893803, MANUFACTURED JANUARY 2017 AND PURCHASED FROM AMAZON IN MAY 2017).      THE ADJUSTABLE HEADREST ON THE CHILD RESTRAINT DOES NOT LOCK INTO PLACE.  OVER THE COURSE OF JUST A FEW SECONDS AFTER THE CHILD IS RESTRAINED IN THE SEAT, THE HEADREST SINKS DOWN RATHER THAN STAYING AT THE SELECTED HEIGHT, WHICH PLACES THE SHOULDER STRAP AT THE INCORRECT HEIGHT.    IN ORDER TO KEEP THE CHILD PROPERLY RESTRAINED AND TO PREVENT INJURY OR DEATH IN A CAR CRASH, THE SHOULDER STRAP MUST BE AT THE CORRECT HEIGHT.  THE FACT THAT THIS RESTRAINT FAILS TO KEEP THE SHOULDER STRAP AT THE RIGHT HEIGHT PRESENTS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN.    WE HAVE OWNED THE BOOSTER SEAT FOR LESS THAN 2 MONTHS, AND IT WAS MANUFACTURED JUST 6 MONTHS AGO.  IT HAS NEVER BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT OR ABUSED IN ANY WAY.  THIS ISSUE OCCURS EVERY TIME WE USE THE RESTRAINT.  WE HAVE CONTACTED THE COMPANY FOR A REPLACEMENT AND HAVE REMOVED THE BACK OF THE BOOSTER SEAT, USING IT AS A BACKLESS BOOSTER FOR THE TIME BEING.",
