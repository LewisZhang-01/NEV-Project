HE RAN A DIAGNOSTIC AND WHAT CAME UP WAS I NEEDED A \"THROTTLE SENSOR\", WHICH MEANT REPLACING THE GAS PEDAL. HE DID THIS. THAT DIDN'T WORK SO HE RE-DID THE PEDAL.  STILL GETTING THE SERVICE TRACTION CONTROL MESSAGE, WITH REDUCED ENGINE POWER, THIS HAPPENS AT RANDOM, NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. NOW THE BIG PROBLEM IS- I HAVE TO GO TO THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP SERVICE AND PAY 150 BUCKS JUST FOR A DIAGNOSTIC. WHICH DOESN'T EVEN GO TOWARD SOLVING THE PROBLEM.",
