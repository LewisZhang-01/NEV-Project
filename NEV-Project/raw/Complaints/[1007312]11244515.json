IT BOUNCED MY FAMILY ACROSS AN INTERSECTION IN A TOTALLY OUT OF CONTROL JOLT. WE HAD IT TOWED TO THE NEAREST HONDA DEALERSHIP AND THEY DID A 'SOFTWARE' UPDATE. THE PROBLEM, LIKE OTHERS HAVE STATED IS THAT THE ISSUE IS NOT CONSISTENT BUT IT IS SCARY AND UNSAFE. I WISH HONDA WOULD DO A RECALL AND FIX THIS ISSUE. WE WERE ACCELERATING FROM A STOPPED POSITION TO CROSS AN  INTERSECTION WHEN THIS OCCURRED THE SECOND TIME. IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S ALWAYS IN A LOW GEAR. IT HAPPENS MILDLY EVERY TIME I TURN INTO MY OWN STREET. IT DOES NOT SHIFT SMOOTHLY AND FEELS LIKE THE TRANSMISSION IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY. WE HAVE HAD HIS VEHICLE FOR 4 YEARS AND HAVE ALWAYS HAD THIS PROBLEM.",
