        "summary": "MY 2013 FORD FOCUS HAS A BAD TRANSMISSION SHUDDER THAT HAPPENS MOSTLY WHEN STARTING OUT FROM A DEAD STOP AND THE TRANSMISSION IS SHIFTING FROM 1ST TO 2ND GEAR . AT TIMES IT  SHUDDERS AND SHAKES SO BAD WHEN STARTING OUT THE VEHICLE WILL ACTUALLY DELAY AND STOP MOVING MOMENTARILY WHILE THE TRANSMISSION IS SHAKING AND SHUDDERING.   IT IS VERY DANGEROUS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WHILE CROSSING A HWY OR TRYING TO GO THROUGH A BUSY INTERSECTION AND THE VEHICLE STOPS MOVING AND JUST SITS THERE AND SHAKES FOR A SECOND OR TWO.  THE LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED IT SCARED MY WIFE SO BAD SHE NOW REFUSES TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE ANYMORE AND DOESNT REALLY CARE TO RIDE IN IT ANYMORE EVEN WHEN I'M DRIVING.  HAD IT TO THE DEALER ABOUT 5 OR 6 TIMES FOR THIS PROBLEM AND THEY REPLACED THE CLUTCHES IN THE TRANSMISSION ONCE AND RE FLASHED THE COMPUTER A NUMBER OF TIMES AND WHILE THAT DID HELP FOR A SHORT TIME AFTER THESE REPAIRS IT ALWAYS STARTS SHUDDERING AGAIN.  FORD SAYS THIS IS NORMAL FOR THE TRANSMISSION TO SHUDDER AND SHAKE SO IF ITS NORMAL WHY DOESNT IT DO IT ALL THE TIME AND WHY DID THE NEW CLUTCHES COMPLETELY TAKE CARE OF THE SHUDDER FOR ABOUT 6 MONTHS??  I WOULD LIKE TO MEET THE ENGINEER THAT DESIGNED THIS TRANSMISSION AND HAVE HIM TELL ME THIS IS NORMAL TO MY FACE AFTER TAKING HIM FOR A RIDE IN THIS VEHICLE.",
