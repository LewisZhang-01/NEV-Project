THE MOTOR THAT WAS INSTALLED IS DOING THE SAME THING. THE COOLING SYSTEM IS OVERHEATING AND WHEN IT DOES I HAVE TO STOP THE CAR AND WAIT UNTIL IT COOLS OFF. I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS VEHICLE. I AM PAYING FOR A VEHICLE AND CANNOT DRIVE IT A LONG DISTANCE WITHOUT IT OVERHEATING. I DRIVE 50 MILES FROM MY JOB AND CANNOT DRIVE MY VEHICLE THAT LENGTH OF DISTANCES WITHOUT MY GAUGE SHOWING OVERHEATING. ATTACHED TO THIS IS A COPY OF THE INVOICE THAT SHOWS PROOF THAT I HAVE HAD ANOTHER MOTOR INSTALLED AND THE REASON IT WAS INSTALLED.",
