THIS HAPPENS WHEN STOPPING IN THE RAIN OR SNOW AND WHEN THE FRONT WHEELS LOOSE TRACTION. AFTER A FEW MINUTES OF PUMPING THE BRAKES THE PEDAL RETURNS TO NORMAL AND THE BRAKES WORK PERFECTLY.  NO CODES ARE DISPLAYED. I TOOK IT INTO MY MECHANIC AND HE COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG.  I RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET AND FOUND 30 OTHER COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME PROBLEM.  I WENT TO JOHN BEAR CADILLAC IN HAMILTON ONT. AND THEY LOOKED UP MY CAR AND COULDN'T RECOMMEND A FIX FOR IT AS THE PARTS WEN'T PRODUCED ANY MORE.  THIS IS A 2011 YEAR CAR AND THE SRX USED THE SAME COMPONETS UNTIL 2016.   THIS IS REALLY DANGEROUS AS I CANNOT DEPEND ON THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKES IN AN EMERGENCY.  ILIVE IN [XXX].
