        "summary": "WAS DRIVING CAR DOWN SECONDARY ROAD AROUND 45MPH. CAR BEGAN TO SLOW IN SPEED, WOULD NOT ACCELERATE & EVENTUALLY JUST CUT OFF. SMOKE/BURNING SMELL CAME FROM ENGINE. TRIED TO JUMP IT TO NO AVAIL. HAD CAR TOWED, MECHANIC HAD TO HAND CRANK ENGINE TO GET IT STARTED. MECHANIC (JOHN @ CAMPBELL'S IN PRINCE GEORGE, VA) INFORMED ME THAT ENGINE SEIZED & NEEDED A NEW ONE. THERE WAS A CURRENT KNOCKING SOUND ONCE THEY FINALLY GOT IT RUNNING. LEARNED OF ENGINE RECALL, HAD CAR TOWED TO DEALERSHIP WHERE CAR WAS PURCHASED (GATEWAY HYUNDAI 2200 WALTHALL CENTER DR. CHESTER VA 23836 804-414-2020 SERVICE TECH: TOMMY, SERVICE CENTER MANAGER: MR. CARPENTER) THEY INFORMED ME OF THE RECALL, TOLD ME THEY WOULD TEST CAR. AFTER HAVING TO CALL SEVERAL TIMES, I WAS FINALLY TOLD THAT THE CAR PASSED THE ENGINE TEST AND WOULD NOT BE REPAIRED UNDER THE RECALL. I REITERATED WHAT I WAS TOLD BY MECHANIC, CAR HAS LESS THAN 100,000 MILES WITH NO PREVIOUS ISSUES & REGULAR MAINTENANCE & NO REASON FOR ENGINE FAILURE. SERVICE TECH AND MANAGER AGREED. HYUNDAI HAD THEM RUN THE SAME TEST 3 TIMES. MR. CARPENTER EXPLAINED THAT THEY HAVE TOLD HYUNDAI MY CAR FALLS UNDER THE RECALL AND SHOULD BE REPAIRED AND AFTER TWO WEEKS OF HAVING NO CAR, HYUNDAI STILL WILL NOT REPAIR MY ENGINE. SERVICE MANAGER SAID THEY HEAR THE KNOCKING BUT HYUNDAI IS STILL DRAGGING IT OUT. MEANWHILE I'M A SINGLE MOTHER OF TWO KIDS AND WORK FULL TIME WITH A FAR COMMUTE AND AM SPENDING EXTRA EXPENSES ON TRANSPORTATION. HYUNDAI KNOWS THERE IS A PROBLEM, THEY SHOULD STOP TRYING TO GET OVER ON INNOCENT PAYING CUSTOMERS AND REMEDY THE SITUATION.",
