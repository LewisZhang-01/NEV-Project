IN ADDITION, IN 2018 THE NOISE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THE WHOLE DASHBOARD SIGNS RED WITH A STRONG NOISE THAT APPEARS SOMETHING BROKE INSIDE. THEN, I IMMEDIATELY STOPPED AND CALL TOYOTA AND THEY ASK ME TO TAKE IT TO A DEALERSHIP BUT DIDN'T OFFER TOWING. THAT DAY, I DROVE TO WORK AND ALL APPEARED NORMAL. THE NOISE COMES ONCES IN A WHILE AND GO AWAY. I AM NOT SURE HOW SERIOUS THIS THING IS AND WHAT TO DO NEXT.      THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELO ON THIS.    SOLOMON",
