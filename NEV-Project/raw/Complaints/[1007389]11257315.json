FRONT WINDOW DOWN REQUIRES TO OPEN BOTH FRONT WINDOWS TO BALANCE; CANNOT LOWER A REAR WINDOW WITHOUT AT LEAST OPENING 1 FRONT WINDOW / USUALLY REQUIRES OPENING BOTH FRONT WINDOWS. IF ONLY ONE REAR WINDOW IS OPEN PLUS FRONT WINDOW(S) THE WIND MOVEMENT RESULTS IN ITEMS IN THE LOADING AREA IN THE TRUNK BEING LIFTED UP AND IF LIGHTS EVEN SUCKED TO THE BACK SEAT. APPEARS TO BE SIGNIFICANT DESIGN FLAW ON VEHICLE. WHEN CLOSING WINDOWS HAVE TO CLOSE REAR WINDOWS FIRST BEFORE CLOSING FRONT WINDOWS, OTHERWISE THE AIR PRESSURE ON THE EAR CANAL IS SO STRONG THAT IT CAUSES EAR DISCOMFORT.",
