THEN THERE WAS NO BRAKING FOR THE 2/3'S OF THE TRAVEL THEN THERE WAS BRAKING AGAIN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PEDAL TRAVEL. BRAKING FORCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN NORMAL. PULLED OF THE ROAD AND SHUT OFF THE CAR. WHEN STARTED AGAIN THE BRAKE PERFORMANCE WAS NORMAL. THIS HAS HAPPENED TWICE - ABOUT 3-4 MONTHS APART. IT HAS BEEN TO AN INDEPENDENT SHOP AND THE DEALERSHIP AND NEITHER WERE ABLE TO REPLICATE THE PROBLEM OR DEFINITIVELY COME UP WITH A FIX.",
