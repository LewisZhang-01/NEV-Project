MANY COMPLAINTS OF THIS ON YOUTUBE INCLUDING A NISSAN DEALERSHIP REPORTING THAT IT HAPPENS ON ALMOST ALL 2013-2016 PATHFINDERS.  IT IS DANGEROUS AS IT AFFECTS VISABILITY.  NISSAN WANTS $141 / VISOR FOR THE PART ALONE.  INSTALLED, GENERALLY OVER $200.  THIS SHOULD BE A SAFETY RECALL.    PROBLEM OCCURRED AS MY WIFE WAS DRIVING AND TRYING TO USE THE SUN VISOR FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE.",
