POWER WAS IN THE VEHICLE BUT ABILITY TO SHIFT IN GEAR WAS GONE. AFTER TURNING OFF AND BACK ON I WAS ABLE TO PUT THE JEEP IN DRIVE IN ORDER TO CLEAR THE ROAD AS TO AVOID A TRAFFIC BUILD UP. IT SEEMS THE TRANSMISSION IS GONE BECAUSE THE VEHICLE WILL NOT CHANGE INTO GEAR NOR REVERSE. A WRECKER COMPANY WAS CONTACTED TO BRING JEEP TO DEALER.",
