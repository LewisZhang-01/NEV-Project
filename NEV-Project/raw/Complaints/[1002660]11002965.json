BLOWOUT OCCURRED ON 07/03/2017 WHILE WIFE WAS DRIVING ON I-55. WE HAVE PUT LESS THAN 12K MILES ON THESE TIRES AND, NOW, DO NOT FEEL SAFE. POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO CAR (VOLVO XC90). WIFE STRANDED OVER JULY 4TH HOLIDAY IN LOUISIANA BECAUSE FIRESTONE IS CLOSED. AFTER INITIALLY TELLING US THAT THE TIRES WOULD BE REPLACED FREE BECAUSE THERE WAS A RECALL, FIRESTONE NOW SAYS WE WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR NEW TIRES BECAUSE OUR TIRES ARE NOT BEING RECALLED. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING.",
