I HAVE TO RE-START MY CAR 1-5 TIMES FOR IT TO START WORKING. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE AND A LIABILITY. I TOOK IT TO FORD AND THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T PULL A CODE. HOWEVER LITERALLY AN HOUR AFTER PICKING UP MY CAR, I GOT THE WARNING AGAIN AND I TOOK A PICTURE OF IT WITH MILEAGE SHOWING TO SHOW IT HAPPENED AFTER. THEY CHARGED ME $100 TO BE TOLD MY CAR IS FINE. IT IS NOT. SINCE TAKING IT IN, MY REAR VIEW CAMERA WILL NOW NOT WORK. I HAVE MADE FORD AWARE OF THIS STEERING ISSUE AND WANT IT FIXED IMMEDIATELY. CLEARLY THE RECALL DID NOT ACCURATELY HIT ALL VIN NUMBERS. THIS HAS HAPPENED AT LEAST 10 TIMES IN PAST 6-8 MONTHS.",
