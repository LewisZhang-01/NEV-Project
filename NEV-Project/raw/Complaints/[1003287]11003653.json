FIRE WENT OUT WENT ALL THE OIL WAS PUMPED OUT OF ENGINE AND CAR STOPPED MOVING. I CONTACTED CHRYSLER SAFETY, THEY REFERRED ME TO DODGE CUSTOMER CARE; THEY INITIALLY CREATED A CASE #31892226  BUT THEN SENT A LETTER SAYING THEY WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE THE CAR WAS OUT OF A THREE-YEAR WARRANTY PERIOD AND ALSO UNSPECIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. ALTHOUGH MY WIFE AND SON WERE ALMOST IMMOLATED, IT WASN'T IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO CHECK INTO. THE CAR REMAINS PARKED AT A LOCAL GARAGE AWAITING INVESTIGATION.",
