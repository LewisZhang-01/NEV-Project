        "summary": "MY VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION ON THE INTERSTATE TRAVELING AT ABOUT 65 MPH AND MY VEHICLE DID AN UNINTENDED DOWNSHIFT TO FIRST GEAR ALMOST COSTING ME MY LIFE. CARS MANAGED TO MISS ME AND I NARROWLY MADE IT TO THE SHOULDER TO A SAFE PLACE TO RECOVER. THE CAR CONTINUED TO JERK IN SIMILAR FASHION AS ATTEMPT TO EXIT THE INTERSTATE TO GET TO A SERVICE CENTER. THE VEHICLE WAS UNABLE TO SAFELY MAKE IT TO THE NEAREST FORD SERVICE CENTER SO I CALLED A TOW THROUGH GEICO ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE. THE TOW TOOK ME TO AUTO NATION FORD AND THERE THEY EXPLAINED TO ME THAT THE ISSUE I EXPERIENCED WAS DUE TO A RECALL THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY FIXING; HOWEVER, WHEN THEY SAW THAT I HAD A 2013 FORD F150 MODEL, HE IMMEDIATELY APPRISED ME OF THE FACT THAT FORD DID NOT HAVE THE SOFTWARE YET TO REPROGRAM THE POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE TO PREVENT THE UNINTENDED DOWNSHIFT. THE REPRESENTATIVE THEN TOLD ME THERE WAS ANOTHER RECALL IN THE SYSTEM FOR THIS VEHICLE THAT HE COULD DO, BUT IT WOULD NOT REMEDY THE INITIAL SITUATION. MY VEHICLE IS NOT DRIVABLE AND I ASKED WHEN FORD WOULD HAVE A REMEDY FOR THIS. HE STATED THAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THIS CURRENT QUARTER, BUT THEY HAD NOT RECEIVED THE INFORMATION TO DO THE REPROGRAM. NOW, I AM WITHOUT A VEHICLE DUE TO NO FAULT OF MY OWN. I THINK THEY SHOULD GIVE ME A LOANER OR PAY FOR A RENTAL CAR, BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO TIMELINE AS TO WHEN THIS RECALL REMEDY WILL BE AVAILABLE.",
