THEY CONTINUE TO REPLACE THE PART WITH ONE THAT FAILS AT 25,000 MILES.YOU KNOW IT'S A CLUTCH WHEN THE CAR IS SHUDDERING, STRUGGLES TO SWITCH BETWEEN GEARS AND DOES NOT FEEL LIKE THE ENGINE IS RUNNING SMOOTHLY. FORD REFUSES TO STAND BEHIND THEIR CAR THAT THEY KNOWINGLY SOLD EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE AWARE OF THE PROBLEMS. WE FIRST TOOK OUR CAR IN FOR SHUDDERS AT 2,000 MILES AND WERE TOLD IT WAS NORMAL. THE LAST REPAIR TOOK ALMOST 1 MONTH.",
