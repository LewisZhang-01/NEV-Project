NO ONE, I REPEAT, NO ONE WILL RIDE WITH ME IN MY CAR UNLESS I DRIVE WITH THE WINDOWS DOWN. I COMPLAINED ABOUT TO THE VW DEALERSHIP (LEITH VW/CAPITOL BLVD. RALEIGH,NC)- AND WAS TOLD BY A TECHNICIAN THAT THEY HAVE HAD THIS COMPLAINT BEFORE AND THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO BE THE THE GLUE USED TO HOLD DOWN THE PADDING/CARPET .  I HAVE VERY BAD SENSE OF SMELL AND DO NOT NOTICE AS BAD AS EVERYONE ELSE..BUT HAVE LATELY DEVELOPED A CHRONIC HACKING COUGH THAT HAS LINGERED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW (W/O PROPER DIAGNOSIS..).  I WOULD LOVE TO BE INCLUDED IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST VW OF AMERICA TO INCLUDE ALL OF THE OTHER VW OWNERS WHO SHARE THIS VERY,VERY STRONG CRAYON-CHEMICAL SMELL..AND HAVE BEEN GETTING NO HELP FROM THE VW CORPORATION. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING THIS CAR FOR OVER 4 YEARS NOW..PUTTING @ 110,000 MILES ON IT IN THAT TIME PERIOD..AND I ALWAYS DRIVE WITH THE WINDOWS UP (EITHER HEAT OR A/C ON).",
