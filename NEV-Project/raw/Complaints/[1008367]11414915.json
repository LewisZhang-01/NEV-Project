        "summary": "VEHICLE, A 2019 F150 LIMITED WITH 10R80 10 SPEED TRANSMISSION HAS HAD TRANSMISSION RELATED ISSUES SINCE DELIVERY.  THERE HAS BEEN A CHATTERING SOUND ON DECELERATION AND VARIOUS TRANSMISSION PERFORMANCE RELATED ISSUES WITH THE VEHICLE. VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO CROWN FORD, FAYETTEVILLE NC, IN SEPTEMBER OF 2020 WITHIN THE FIRST 5,000 MILES OF OWNERSHIP TO ADDRESS THE CHATTERING/HARD SHIFTING ISSUE. THE TRUCK SPENT 34 DAYS IN THE SHOP AND I WAS TOLD THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE REAR AXLE HOUSING AND WHEEL BEARINGS WHICH WERE REPLACED.  THE TRANSMISSION ISSUES CONTINUED TO OCCUR AFTER THE FIX.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK AND SPOKE WITH SERVICE MANAGER AND SENIOR MECHANIC TO LET THEM KNOW THERE WERE STILL ISSUES.  THE MECHANIC RODE WITH ME AND ADVISED ME NOT TO LEAVE THE TRUCK AT THE SHOP AGAIN AND THAT \"WHATEVER IT WAS, IT'S NOTHING MAJOR WRONG WITH YOUR TRUCK\" AND TO CONTINUE DRIVING IT.  ISSUES HAVE BECOME PROGRESSIVELY WORSE WITH A NOTICEABLE \"CLUNK\" WHEN STARTING THE TRUCK OR SHIFTING INTO GEAR. THE TRUCK HAS LOST POWER BETWEEN SHIFTS WHILE IN NOTION AND HAS EXHIBITED EXTREMELY HARSH SHIFTS NUMEROUS TIMES, SO MUCH SO THAT IT FELT LIKE I HIT SOMETHING IN THE ROAD.  THE TRUCK NOW IS NOW  ACTING LIKE IT DOESN'T WANT TO SHIFT AND AS IF IT HAS NO POWER, AS WELL AS THE APPEARANCE OF A MIL ON THE DASH.  TRUCK HAS BEEN TAKEN BACK TO CROWN FORD AGAIN FOR DIAGNOSIS AND I AM AWAITING RESULTS.  GIVEN THE NUMBER OF ISSUES RELATED TO THE F150 AND THIS PARTICULAR TRANSMISSION SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO ADDRESS WHAT ARE SERIOUS SAFETY AND DRIVABILITY ISSUES.  I HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN THIS TRUCK OR THAT IT WILL PERFORM AS ADVERTISED BY FORD MOTOR COMPANY IN THE FUTURE.  THIS TRUCK HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS SINCE PURCHASED.",
