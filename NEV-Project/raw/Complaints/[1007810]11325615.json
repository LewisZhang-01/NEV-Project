        "summary": "THE AXLE ON THE BACK DRIVER'S SIDE IS TERRIBLY RUSTED TO THE POINT OF NO REPAIR. THE MECHANIC STATED IT IS A RECALL PROBLEM AND NEEDS TO BE TAKEN TO THE FORD DEALER. HE ALSO STATED THAT IT IS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE DUE TO THE PROBLEMS THAT IT WAS CAUSING THE WHEEL TO NOT FIT OR STAY ON CORRECTLY CAUSING IT TO RUB ON THE VANS SURFACE CAUSING A BLOWOUT AND MAKING DRIVING ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE AND DANGEROUS. THANK GOD MY SON DROVE IT AND NOT MYSELF. THANK GOD THAT HE IS OKAY. THIS PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE DEALT WITH ASAP. I AM A FOSTER MOM AND DRIVE CHILDREN IN THIS VAN AND IT DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE INSPECTED FOR THE PROBLEMS AND REPAIRED. MY SON WAS ON HIS WAY TO PUT GAS INTO THE VEHICLE WHEN THIS HAPPENED. THE KIDS AND I WERE GOING TO HIT THE HIGHWAY AND GO TO A FOOD PANTRY IN THE ADJOINING CITY. THANK GOD WE DIDN'T. THIS ALL HAPPENED WHILE MY SON TOOK THE CAR TO PUT GAS IN BEFORE THE KIDS AND I WERE TO LEAVE OUT. WE HAD ALREADY STATED THAT THE WHEEL WASN'T FITTING ON WELL AND DECIDED TO TAKE IT TO THE MECHANIC. THE MECHANIC TOLD US THERE WAS NOTHING HE COULD DO BECAUSE OF THE CORROSION AND THEN INFORMED US ABOUT THE RECALL ON THE VEHICLE AND THE PROBLEMS THIS MODEL WAS HAVING WITH  THE AXLES AND RUST AND CORROSION AND OTHER PROBLEMS. THANK GOD THIS WAS ON A CITY STREET AND AT THE TIME THERE WAS LITTLE TRAFFIC, OTHERWISE  IT COULD HAVE BEEN A DANGEROUS MESS.  *TR",
