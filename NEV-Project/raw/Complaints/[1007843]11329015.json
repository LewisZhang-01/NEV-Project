I HAVE CONTACTED MY LOCAL DEALERS AND THEY TELL ME THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL ME. I HAVE BEEN CONTACTING THEM PERIODICALLY THE WHOLE 4 YEARS. I HAVE GRANDCHILDREN WHO RIDE ON OCCASION IN THIS VEHICLE AND I FEAR FOR THEIR SAFETY. WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET A FIX??!!  I OWN TWO OTHER VEHICLES NOT GM PRODUCTS. ONE WAS FIXED IN 2 WEEKS, THE OTHER IN ABOUT A MONTH. THIS IS PATHETIC! WHAT AN EMBARRASSMENT. EASY TO SEE WHY FORD F150 OUTSELLS GMC/CHEVY AND RAM AND TUNDRA ARE CLOSING THE GAP. I DO FEEL SORRY FOR THE SERVICE MANAGERS WHO KEEP HAVING TO MAKE EXCUSES FOR AN INEPT CORPORATION. NEEDLESS TO SAY YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME OR MY FAMILY IN ANOTHER GENERAL MOTORS SHOWROOM OR VEHICLE.  *TR",
