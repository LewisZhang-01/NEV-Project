        "summary": "TAKATA RECALL. I RECEIVED NOTICE IN LATE JULY 2016 ABOUT THE TAKATA AIRBAG RECALL FOR MY VEHICLE. DUE TO TRAVEL, IT WAS A FEW WEEKS BEFORE I COULD TAKE IT IN TO THE DEALER. I WAS OFFERED A TOYOTA CAMRY AS A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE, BUT I REQUESTED FROM TOYOTA USA, AND RECEIVED, AUTHORIZATION TO RENT A MINIVAN THROUGH ENTERPRISE. I PICKED UP THAT VEHICLE MID AUGUST 2016. IN NOVEMBER 2016 I RECEIVED NOTICE THAT MY VAN ALSO HAD A SLIDING DOOR RECALL. I INITIALLY STORED MY VEHICLE AT THE DEALERSHIP, BUT WAS TOLD TO MOVE IT TO MY HOME IN LATE DECEMBER 2016. IT IS NOW LATE JUNE 2017 AND I HAVE HEARD NOTHING ABOUT EITHER OF THESE RECALLS. THE SAFERCARS.GOV WEBSITE SAYS THERE IS NO REMEDY AVAILABLE FOR EITHER RECALL YET. ALMOST 11 MONTHS I HAVE BEEN WAITING ON THE AIRBAG RECALL, AND 7 MONTHS ON THE SLIDING DOOR RECALL. THIS IS AN UNACCEPTABLE WAITING TIME. YES, I HAVE A RENTAL CAR AVAILABLE TO ME, FOR WHICH I'M GRATEFUL, BUT IN THE MEANTIME MY OWN CAR IS SITTING IN THE DRIVEWAY, UNDRIVEN, AND BASICALLY ROTTING. TOYOTA HAS SPENT OVER $17,000 RENTING A VEHICLE FOR ME TO DRIVE, WHICH IS RIDICULOUS. THEY SHOULD HAVE JUST BOUGHT MY CAR FROM ME AND BEEN DONE WITH IT. I'M SO FRUSTRATED WITH THIS SITUATION. HOW MUCH LONGER AM I SUPPOSED TO WAIT???",
