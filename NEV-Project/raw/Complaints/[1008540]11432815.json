        "summary": "On three different occasions, I have experienced automatic emergency braking of the car which, rather than keeping me safe, placed me in a very dangerous situation. Each time, I was in a controlled intersection on a green light and in the left turn lane, with oncoming traffic also having a green light. When it was amply safe to make the left turn, with oncoming traffic at a safe distance from the intersection, I began my left turn. Just as my car was turning in front of that oncoming traffic, and just as I needed to proceed safely and promptly through the intersection, the Pre-Sense system jammed on the brakes, stopping my car in the path of oncoming traffic. In the time it took to get over the shock of that happening and finish the turn, and if the oncoming traffic had not been paying attention, serious accidents could have resulted.  Please note that all three of these incidents occurred with the Pre-Sense system set at its least sensitive position. I have since turned the system off completely. I have not contacted the dealer or the manufacturer.",
