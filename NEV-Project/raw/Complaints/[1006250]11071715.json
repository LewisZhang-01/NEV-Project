THE ONLY WAY THE DEALER WILL FIX THE ISSUE IS IF THE PROBLEM IS SEEN 1ST HAND AND OCCURS FOR LONGER THEN 8 SECONDS. I HAVE PAID FOR MULTIPLE RENTAL CARS AND SPENT MULTIPLE HOURS AT THE DEALER TO HAVE THIS ISSUE FIXED AND IT KEEPS RECURRING. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO FIX IT WITHOUT RE-OCCURRENCE. MY FINAL POINT IS THAT YESTERDAY WHEN DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE MY CAR STARTED AFTER ITS SECOND TRY, I THEN DROVE ONTO THE STREET AND THE ENGINE SHUT OFF AND THE BRAKES LOCKED UP. LUCKILY THERE WAS NOT ANY CROSS TRAFFIC BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT ON A BUSY STREET WITH MY DAUGHTER AND MYSELF IN THE CAR. THIS   HSE RISK HAS CAUSED ME TO BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DRIVABILITY OF MY VEHICLE AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ASAP!",
