AFTER NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS IT WILL STOP AND LET ME IN. SAME IS TRUE IF I'M IN THE CAR EXCEPT NOW I CAN'T GET OUT. IT'S USUALLY MUCH WORSE DURING THE DAY THAN AT NIGHT. DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE IN THE CAR, TRYING TO GET IN OR NEARBY (I DON'T HAVE A REMOTE NOR IS IT AN OPTION). THE CAR CAN BE SITTING IDLE FOR HOURS AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN STARTS LOCKING AND UNLOCKING ITSELF IN RAPID SUCCESSION. RARELY IF EVER DOES IT END UP UNLOCKED. WILL OCCASIONALLY GO THROUGH THE SAME PROCEDURE WHILE DRIVING. IT DOESN'T EFFECT ANYTHING BUT ALL THE DOOR LOCKS (AT LEAST THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN). IF IT MATTERS I COULD SEND A VIDEO OF THIS PROBLEM. THE QUESTION BELOW OF WHEN DOES THIS HAPPEN IS MOOT. IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY AT ANYTIME. I'VE TRIED NUMEROUS WORKAROUNDS WITH LITTLE SUCCESS BECAUSE THE CAR SEEMS TO ADAPT AND THEN BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT. ( BELIEVE ME, I KNOW WHAT THIS SOUNDS LIKE.)",
