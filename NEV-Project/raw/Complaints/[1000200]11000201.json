AS AN OWNER, I WAS NOT APPRISED OF THIS RISK UNTIL JUNE 20, 2017.  THEN, WHEN I INQUIRED ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF A REPAIR TO CORRECT THIS LEMON I WAS \"INFORMED\", \"ADVISED\" THERE WAS NO REPAIR AVAILABLE AND SUCH REPAIR(S) MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR SIX MONTHS.  I WAS GIVEN A VAGUE ESTIMATE, AND VAGUE \"ASSURANCE\" I WOULD BE APPRISED OF REPAIR AVAILABILITY WHEN READY.  I ASKED, \"SHOULD I BEE DRIVING THIS FLAW?\"  THEY HAD NO SPECIFIC GUIDANCE.  SERIOUSLY?    ACCORDINFLY, I AM INVOKING \"LEMON LAW\" AND DEMANDING FULL LIQUIDATION OF MY EXISTING AUTO LOAN AT JEEP'S EXPENSE. IF THEY DO NOT OBLIGE, I SHALL SEEK CIVIL SUIT DAMAGES BY JURY TRIAL FOR ADDED EMOTIONAL PAIN AND SUFFERING COUPLED WITH THEIR FAILURE TO FULLY-DISCLOSE POTENTIAL FATAL FLAW FOR OVER SIX MONTHS TO JEEP OWNERS.    I EXPECT THE NHTSA TO MANAGE THIS CLAIM.  PERIOD.  WHAT A MESS.  WHAT COUNTRY IS THIS?  IS ANYONE WATCHING AND PROTECTING CONSUMERS?  I EXPECT THE NHTSA TO FORCE JEEP TO IMMEDIATELY UNDERTAKE A FULL BUYBACK PROGRAM NO LATER THAN JULY 1, 2017.  PERIOD.",
