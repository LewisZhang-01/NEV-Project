        "summary": "REGARDING SERVICE BRAKES, HYDRAULIC: SWITCHES: BRAKE LIGHT  RECALL FOR 2007 HYUNDAI VERACRUZ, NHTSA REFERENCE #09V122000. MY 2007 VERACRUZ SUFFERS FROM SOME OF THE EXACT PROBLEMS DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL BUT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL. THE RECALL DESCRIBES THE FOLLOWING: \"A STOP LAMP SWITCH MALFUNCTION MAY ALSO AFFECT THE OPERATION OF THE BRAKE-TRANSMISSION SHIFT INTERLOCK FEATURE SO THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTER WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE SHIFTED OUT OF THE PARK POSITION. IT MAY ALSO CAUSE THE ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL (ESC) MALFUNCTION LIGHT TO ILLUMINATE.\"   FOR THE PAST 3 YEARS THE ESC LIGHT ON MY 2007 VERACRUZ HAS ILLUMINATED PERIODICALLY WHILE DRIVING OR WHEN STARTING THE CAR, AND IT WILL REMAIN ON UNTIL THE ENGINE IS SHUT OFF. PRESSING THE ESC ON/OFF BUTTON ON THE DASH WILL NOT SHUT THE LIGHT OFF WHILE IN PARK OR DRIVING. TURNING THE CAR OFF IS THE ONLY WAY TO TURN THE LIGHT OFF. I CONTACTED THE LOCAL HYUNDAI DEALER AND DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM, THEIR ANSWER WAS THAT THE LIGHT ILLUMINATING IS NORMAL AND NOT TO WORRY.   ALSO, FOR THE PAST 3 MONTHS, PERIODICALLY THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION SHIFTER WILL NOT SHIFT OUT OF PARK. YOU MUST SHUT OFF AND RESTART THE CAR A FEW TIMES FOR THE TRANSMISSION TO OPERATE.    I BELIEVE THAT THESE PROBLEMS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE RECALL AND MY VERACRUZ SHOULD BE INCLUDED SO THAT MY VEHICLE OPERATES PROPERLY.   THANK YOU.",
