IT ALSO RUPTURED THE GAS TANK.   WE CALLED CHRYSLER COOPERATION AND THEY SAID TO HAVE A LOCAL DEALER LOOK AT IT.   THEY DID AND TOLD US IT WASN'T UNDER WARRANTY, WHICH WE ALREADY KNEW.   I WAS SHOCKED THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HELP AND CONSIDER RECALLING THE OTHER TRUCKS FROM THE TIME AND PLACE THIS ONE WAS MADE TO CHECK THEIR FRAMES.   I TRIED TO SEND PICTURES BUT IT WON'T LET ME ON HERE THIS IS MY SECOND ATTEMPT.   I FEEL STRONGLY THAT THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE THAT SOMEONE FROM THE HIGHWAY SAFETY DEPARTMENT SHOULD AT LEAST LOOK AT.   PLEASE GET A HOLD OF ME SO I CAN SEND YOU A PICTURE OF THIS BROKEN FRAME SO YOU CAN MAKE YOUR DETERMINATION.   THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.  AND THIS TRUCK WAS IN MOTION WHEN THE FRAME BROKE I THOUGHT I'D HIT A BIG POTHOLE *JS",
