        "summary": "I PURCHASED MY 2018 HONDA CR-V EX 2WD IN FLORIDA APRIL 2018. I HAVE APPROXIMATELY 15,000 MILES ON IT NOW. I TRAVEL THROUGH INDIANA AND OHIO DURING THE YEAR, INCLUDING WINTER MONTHS. I HAVE SMELLED GASOLINE FUMES IN THE CAR AND HAVE SMELLED GASOLINE IN THE OIL ESPECIALLY IN WINTER MONTHS WHEN I AM TRAVELING NORTH. I CALLED HONDA CORP ABOUT THE OIL DILUTION PROBLEM AND THE TSB 18-114 AND TSB 18-124 THAT WERE ADDRESSED TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THEY TOLD ME THAT IT ONLY COVERS NORTHERN STATES. I EXPLAINED THAT I TRAVEL THROUGH NORTHERN STATES DURING THE YEAR AND HAVE EXPERIENCED GASOLINE FUMES IN THE CABIN AND ALSO IN THE OIL. THEY TOLD ME TO TAKE IT IN TO A DEALER WHEN I AM IN INDIANA AND OHIO DURING THE WINTER. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS I AM AT WORK AND UNABLE TO TAKE THE TIME OFF TO GO TO A DEALER, NOT UNTIL I GET HOME TO FLORIDA AND THEN THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE GONE. SO I AM ONLY REQUESTING THAT TSB 18-114 AND 18-124 BE APPLIED TO MY VEHICLE ALSO. THE \"FIX\" TO OIL DILUTION SHOULD NOT JUST BE APPLIED TO NORTHERN STATES WHEN MANY OF US TRAVEL THROUGH NORTHERN STATES IN THE WINTER. I AM GOING TO PURSUE THIS IF I DON'T HEAR BACK FROM HONDA CORP AFTER THEIR PREVIOUS CALL TO ME DID NOT DO ANYTHING TO ADDRESS MY  PROBLEM. I JUST WANT THE TIB'S APPLIED TO MY VEHICLE.",
