        "summary": "Toyota emphatically advertises that its  2020 RAV4 hybrids come equipped with a 14.5-gallon gas tank that can hit a 580-mile driving range.  The cars suffer from the apparent fuel tank issue that harms both the environment and the benefit of the cars\u2019 electric power. The RAV4 hybrids not only fail to comply with federal and state gas tank regulations, which prohibit the sale of vehicles that cannot fill 90 percent or within two gallons of their nominal gas tank capacity, but suffer from substantially reduced driving range.  The fuel tank defect poses an environmental and safety hazard in that drivers are left to guess how much gas they have left and effectively encouraged to top off their fuel tanks in order to fill up as much as possible,",
