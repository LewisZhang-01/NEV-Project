PER THE OWNERS MANUAL, I TOOK IT IN FOR SERVICE THE NEXT MORNING. THE SERVICE DEPT. SAID THERE IS SOMETHING FAULTY IN THE SEAT CUSHION & A NEW ONE IS ON ORDER, BUT WITH NO DELIVERY TIME PROVIDED.  IT'S ALREADY BEEN TWO MONTHS SINCE THE ORDER WAS PLACED - NOT SURE WHAT THE REAL ISSUE IS.  THE WARNING LIGHT WAS RANDOM AT FIRST BUT, NOW IT'S ON CONTINUOUSLY.  I JUST HOPE EVERYONE IS PROTECTED IN MY CAR, IF I GET IN AN ACCIDENT. I HAVE RECENTLY CONTACTED SUBARU'S CUSTOMER SERVICE TO SEE IF I CAN GET ANY ADDITIONAL ANSWERS.",
