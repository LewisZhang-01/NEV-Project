WHEN TURNING I HAVE TO MUSCLE THE STEERING WHEEL, THE TRUCK WILL START TO DRIFT OUT OF THE LANE OR TRAVEL AND CONTINUE IN THAT DIRECTION INSTEAD OF RETURNING TO CENTER.  I AM ALWAYS CORRECTING THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.  THE TRUCK WILL TRAVEL IN A STRAIGHT LINE.  IT ACTS AS IF THE FRONT END  ALIGNMENT  IS OUT PULLING THE TRUCK ONE WAY AND THEN THE OTHER ONCE CORRECTED.  IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOU ARE FIGHTING THE STEERING. THE ENTIRE TIME IN AM DRIVING MY TRUCK.  I HAVE ANOTHER 2011 F150 AND I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT ONE TO START HAVING PROBLEMS",
