A  HIGH PITCHED NOISE WAS EMITTED,  CAR STARTED SMOKING FROM VENTS AND SMELLED LIKE AN ELECTRICAL FIRE. I WAS PASSING A TURNPIKE STOP AND WAS ABLE TO UNSAFELY CROSS SEVERAL LANES OF TRAFFIC TO PULL IN TO THE STOP.  I MADE IT INTO THE PARKING LOT JUST IN TIME AND THE CAR CUT OUT.  HAD TO TAKE TO BE TOWED TO THE CLOSEST MECHANIC AND LEAVE OVERNIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS TOO HOT TO CONNECT TO COMPUTER TO TROUBLESHOOT.  THE BATTERY CASING WAS MELTED. THE ALTERNATOR AND THE BATTERY HAD TO BE REPLACED.  I AM VERY GRATEFUL THAT I WAS NEXT TO A TURNPIKE STOP WHEN THIS HAPPENED OR MY CAR WOULD HAVE SHUT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY AND COULD HAVE RESULTED IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.",
