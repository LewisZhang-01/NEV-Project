        "summary": "2 MONTHS AFTER GETTING THE PRIUS, I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 50 MPH ON A ELEVATED, SINGLE-LANE HIGHWAY OVERPASS WITH NO CARS IN FRONT OF ME WHEN I HEARD A CRACK AND NOTICED A CHIP IN THE WINDSHIELD ON THE PASSENGER SIDE.  I HAD IT REPAIRED THAT DAY, BUT IT STILL SHOWS UP.  IT HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE THEN.    8 MONTHS LATER, I WAS DRIVING AT AROUND 50 MPH ON A HIGHWAY AND SAW A MAN IN A PICKUP TRUCK THROW HIS ARM OUT OF HIS OPEN WINDOW, LIKE HE WAS TOSSING SOMETHING.  ALMOST INSTANTLY I HEARD A CRACK AND THERE WAS ALREADY A CRACK A FEW INCHES HIGH, FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE WINDSHIELD, ON THE LOWER-LEFT OF THE DRIVERS SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD.  I TOOK A PICTURE OF THE TRUCK WITH THE LICENSE PLATE, JUST IN CASE IT MIGHT HELP.  WHEN I HAD GOTTEN TO MY DESTINATION, I CHECKED THE CRACK AND WHERE IT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD STARTED, FROM A SMALL CHIP NEAR THE BOTTOM EDGE OF THE WINDSHIELD.  BY NOW, THE CRACK HAD EXTENDED SEVERAL MORE INCHES.  I THEN CALLED MY INSURANCE TO MAKE A CLAIM.  THAT WAS 3 WEEKS AGO AND I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET A REPLACEMENT AS I WAS TOLD THAT THERE IS A NATIONAL BACK ORDER ON PRIUS 2016 WINDSHIELDS.    THE FIRST INCLUDED PHOTO WAS TAKEN RIGHT AFTER THE CRACK APPEARED.  THE SECOND PHOTO, ALTHOUGH A LITTLE OUT OF FOCUS, HAS A SMALL WHITE CIRCLE, WHICH IS WHERE IT LOOKED LIKE THE UNKNOWN OBJECT STRUCK THE WINDSHIELD.",
