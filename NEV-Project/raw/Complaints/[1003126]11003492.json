YOU HAVE TO LIMP THE VEHICLE THE TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO TURN THE ENGINE OFF AND THEN START IT BACK. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION  WHEN IN TRAFFIC. I FEEL THIS COULD CAUSE A WRECK. I  AM CONCERNED ABOUT MY SAFETY AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLES SAFETY. THIS HAS HAPPENED AT LEAST 10 TIMES IN THE LAST 10 DAYS. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE LOCAL FORD DEALER. THEY REPLACED THE THROTTLE BODY AND INFORMED ME THAT THIS WAS NOT COVERED UNDER ANY WARRANTY OR RECALL. I KNOW THAT OTHER FORD VEHICLES HAVE THIS SAME ISSUE",
