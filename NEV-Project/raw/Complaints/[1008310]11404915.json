THIS PAST YEAR I MAY HAVE DRIVEN MY CAR 5000 MILES.  IT HAS NOT BEEN IN ANY STORMS OR EIGHT WIND SITUATIONS. I HAVE BEEN HEARING A STRANGE NOISE IN THE FRONT BUT DID NOT CONNECT THIS TO A TRIM MOLDING ISSUE.  IT IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE IT COULD FLY OFF AND HIT A PEDESTRIAN,MOTORCYCLE RIDER OR BICYCLE RIDER OR EVEN ANOTHER VEHICLE.",
