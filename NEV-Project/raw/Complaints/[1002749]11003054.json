I WOULD EXPERIENCE A SEVERE DECREASE IN BRAKE FUNCTION (I WOULD NEED TO SLAM ON THE BRAKES TO GET THEM TO APPLY PROPERLY).  THIS HAPPENED FOUR TIMES BEFORE THE SERVICE CENTER WAS ABLE TO DIAGNOSE A FAILED ABS ACTUATOR.  THIS IS APPARENTLY A KNOWN ISSUE FOR THE CAMRY HYBRIDS, AS TOYOTA ISSUED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR 2006-2011 CAMRY HYBRIDS FOR THIS VERY PROBLEM.  (UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE A 2012 HYBRID AND THE SERVICE CENTER WOULD LIKE TO CHARGE ME OVER $3K (!) TO FIX THIS ISSUE.).",
