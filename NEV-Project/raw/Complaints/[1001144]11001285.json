THE PLASTIC THAT WAS UTILIZED IN THE DESIGN AND MAKING OF THE HANDLE BECAME BRITTLE AND NOW HAS BROKEN. THIS STARTED TO OCCUR YEARS AGO WITH THE PASSENGER FRONT AND BACK INTERIOR HANDLE AND MOST RECENTLY WITH THE DRIVER SIDE FRONT WHICH NOW I HAVE TO WIND THE WINDOW DOWN TO OPEN THE DOOR FROM THE OUTSIDE WHICH IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE IF I SHOULD GET INTO A CAR WRECK OR SOMETHING OF THIS NATURE. THE COST IN GETTING THIS ISSUE FIXED IS UNAFFORDABLE TO ME.",
