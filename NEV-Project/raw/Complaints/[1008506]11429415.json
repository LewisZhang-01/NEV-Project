        "summary": "Shifter cannot be moved out of PARK without pushing down on the SHIFT LOCK RELEASE.  I must do this every time I want to go forward or backward.  A reliable service center informed me this is a frequent problem with the 2016 Kia Sorento and he suggested a recall may be forthcoming.  Owners manual states that when using the RELEASE, depress the brake pedal so vehicles does not lurch forward or back.  The additional step to move the car may be hazardous when attempting to get out of the way.  Service center isolated the problem to Body Control Module which is expensive and OEM only. This happened without warning when I parked briefly in the road adjacent to a friend's driveway. I blocked the road until I discovered how to use the RELEASE button.",
