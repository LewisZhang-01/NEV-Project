I HAVE 2 SETS OF KEY FOBS, AND IT HAPPENS TO BOTH OF THEM. IT HAS GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE I WILL NOT DRIVE IT WITH MY FAMILY OF 6. I HAVE BEEN RECEIVING LETTERS FROM CHRYSLER STATING THAT THEY HAVE NO TIME TABLE FOR A REPLACEMENT OF THE IGNITION SWITCH. IT HAS BEEN OVER 2 YEARS OF LETTERS WITH NO ANSWER IN SIGHT. STARTING TO GET TO THE POINT OF HIRING AN ATTORNEY IF NOTHING IS GETTING RESOLVED SOON.",
