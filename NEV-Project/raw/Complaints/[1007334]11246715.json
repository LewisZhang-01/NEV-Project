THE CRUISE CONTROL IS BEING USED AND WHEN YOU GO TO APPLY THE BRAKES THE CAR DOES NOT SLOW DOWN BUT REVS THE MOTOR UP AND WILL NOT LET YOU SLOW DOWN.  IT IS FRIGHTENING TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN.  IF YOU TAP THE BRAKES BUT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK OR HIT THE CRUISE OFF BUTTON IT WILL FINALLY STOP.  THIS COULD BE PUTTING US IN A REALLY BAD SITUATION IF YOU CANT GET IT STOPPED.  ALSO THE ESC LIGHT COMES ON FOR NO REASON WHILE DRIVING ON DRY ROADS.  I CALLED MY CHEVY DEALER AND WAS TOLD THE RECALL 13036 WAS ALREADY DONE IN AUG 2014 IF THIS IS THE SAME ISSUE AS RECALL.  IF SO IT DID NOT TAKE CARE OF THE PROBLEM AND NEEDS TO BE TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE IT COSTS SOMEONE THEIR LIFE.",
