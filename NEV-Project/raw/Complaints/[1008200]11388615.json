I HAD TO HAVE MY STRUTS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY. CAMBER NOT ADJUSTABLE, DEALER UNDER WARRANTY MADE WHOLE BIGGER FOR ADJUSTMENT. MY 2018 DODGE JOURNEY CROSSROAD NOW ONLY HAS 64,000 MILES AND MY FRONT PASSENGER SIDE TOP CAMBER BOLT BROKE AND MY WHEEL FELL OUTWARD. THANK GOD I WAS JUST PULLING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY MAKING A RIGHT HAND TURN WHEN IT HAPPENED.",
