WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY WITH MINIMAL TRAFFIC IN A CLEAR STRAIGHT AWAY (NO OVERPASSES) WE HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A GUN SHOT AND I PANICKED. MY HUSBAND THOUGHT I MAY LOOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE OUT OF FEAR.  HE WAS ABLE TO COACH ME TO PULL OFF THE HIGHWAY SO WE COULD INSPECT THE VEHICLE. THE SUNROOF HAD LOOKED LIKE IT EXPLODED FROM THE INSIDE OUT. WE CALLED THE DEALERSHIP WHICH STATED THEY DO NOT COVER ANY GLASS DAMAGE AND REFERRED ME TO SAFELITE WHICH THEN REFERRED ME TO SUNROOF EXPRESS FOR REPAIR. THIS WAS EXTREMELY UPSETTING AS NOTHING STRUCK THE VEHICLE AND WE FEEL THAT WE WERE NOT AT FAULT. WE DID NOTHING TO CAUSE THE BREAKAGE.",
