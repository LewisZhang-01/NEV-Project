        "summary": "CAME OUT OF THE GROCERY STORE ABOUT 9PM ON 6-28-17, AND THE CAR WON'T START. HAD IT TOWED TO A LOCAL MECHANIC WHO EVALUATED THAT THE TIMING CHAIN ON THE ECOTEC ENGINE HAS BASICALLY MISALIIGNED AND SHREDDED PARTS IN IT'S PATH, DESTROYING THE ENGINE. I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AND SEE MANY COMPLAINTS OF THIS HAPPENING AND THIS VIDEO LINK: HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=AEEUYUNUHGS I CHATTED ONLINE WITH CHEVROLET CUSTOMER SERVICE WHO SAYS THAT THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING SINCE I HAD NOT BOUGHT THE CAR \"CERTIFIED\" AT A GM DEALERSHIP. THE ESTIMATE FOR THESE REPAIRS IS VALUED AT MORE THAN HALF OF WHAT THE CAR IS FINANCED FOR. I'M FEELING LIKE I HAVE A GIANT PIECE OF JUNK ON MY HANDS. LUCKILY IT DIDN'T SEIZE UP WHILE DRIVING. SO FAR MY OUT OF POCKET EXPENSE INCLUES $93.00 FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND AN ADDITIONAL $44.00 TO HAVE IT TOWED TO THE DEALER'S MECHANIC FOR THEM TO DO AN EVALUATION 7-5-17. PROBABLY LOOKING AT $5,000 TO $7,000 OF DOLLARS TO REPAIR AND GET BACK ON THE ROAD. CERTAINLY CAN'T AFFORD THAT. IT PRACTICALLY ADDS UP TO BE THE PRICE OF BUYING A NEW ONE.",
