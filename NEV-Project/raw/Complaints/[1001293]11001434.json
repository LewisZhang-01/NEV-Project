THEN AFTER LETTING IT SET OF A MINUTE/COOLDOWN, IT WILL RIDE FOR A FEW MILES THEN COMPLETE STOP WITH THE ENGINE STILL RUNNING. I NOTICE A HOT SMELL COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD.   THE TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT AND STABILITRACK STATE THAT IT NEEDS SERVICE. WHEN I DRIVE IT THE BRAKES STOP THE CAR ON ITS OWN. I TOOK THE CAR TO GMC AND IT COST ME $1700 FOR THEM TO FIX BRAKE PRESSURE MODULE, BRAKE ELECTRIC CONTROL PANEL, I REPLACED HUB BEARINGS AND THE PROBLEM IS STILL THERE. SINCE THOSE THINGS WERE REPLACED, I CAN DRIVE A LITTLE LONGER WITHOUT THE HUB BEARINGS. I TOOK MY CAR TO GMC 3 TIMES.  AND MY AIRBAG LIGHT IS ON AND THEY SAID THAT NEED TO BE REPLACED, HOW WHEN IT WAS NEVER USED.",
