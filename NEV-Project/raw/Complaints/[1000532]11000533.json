THIS CAUSED THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TO COME ON.  WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO SHIFT INTO ANY OTHER GEAR, THE \"PRND\" LIGHTS WOULD NOT ILLUMINATE.  WHEN THE TRUCK WAS PUT INTO DRIVE, THE GEAR WOULD ENGAGE, BUT IT SEEMED TO BE UNDER LIMITED POWER.  WHEN GEARS A CHANGED, THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTS VERY HARD.  IF THE VEHICLE IS PLACED IN PARK AND TURNED OFF, WHEN IT IS TURNED BACK ON THE GEAR SELECTION ILLUMINATION LIGHT SHOWS, BUT ONCE THE TRANSMISSION IS PLACED IN REVERSE, THE ISSUE REPEATS.   A RECALL WAS DONE FOR THIS EXACT ISSUE ON THIS YEAR, MAKE, AND MODEL OF VEHICLE, BUT THE VIN DOES NOT SHOW ANY ACTIVE RECALLS.",
