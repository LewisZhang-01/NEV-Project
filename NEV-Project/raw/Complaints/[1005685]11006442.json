HIS ADVISE WAS TO DRIVE CAREFULLY AND NOT GO OVER BIG BUMPS.     I TOOK IT TO A REPAIR SHOP AND IMMEDIATELY THE OWNER KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. HE       THE OWNER HAD ALREADY FIXED AT LEAST 4 ALTIMAS SAME YEAR.    HE SAID THE STEEL WAS THIN AND RUSTED QUICK.  MY CAR WAS ALMOST ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FLOORS.    STEEL IS, IN FACT MADE MUCH BETTER AND VERY LITTLE RUST SHOWS ON CARS.     MINE CAR HAS NO RUST (EXCEPT FLOOR BOARDS IN FRONT)    IT HAS BEEN FIXED $500.",
