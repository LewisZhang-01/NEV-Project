THEY INFORMED ME THE PASSENGER SEAT BELT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. THIS SEEMS RIDICULOUS CONSIDEING THE CAR IS LESS THAN 5 YEARS OLD. I ENDED UP HAIGB TO PAY OVER $300 FOR A NEW PASSENGER SEAT BELT INCLUDING INSTALLATION. WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD I GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT? WHY IS SUCH A NEW SEAT BELT FAILING? SHOULD I WORRY THAT MY DRIVER'S SEAT BELT WILL FAIL AS WELL? IT DOESN'T SEEM THIS SHOULD BE HAPPENING ON SUCH A NEW CAR. I AM HAPPY TO PROVIDE REPAIR RECEIPTS AS REQUESTED.",
