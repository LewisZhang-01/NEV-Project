        "summary": "I HAVE EXPERIENCED AN EXTREME SHIMMING (DEATH WOBBLE) NUMEROUS TIMES WHILE DRIVING AT SPEED ON THE FREEWAY. AFTER GOING OVER A BRIDGE EXPANSION JOINT OR JUST A ROUGH SPOT IN THE HIGHWAY, MY TRUCK STARTS SHIMMING SO VIOLENTLY THAT I HAVE TO BRAKE HARD TO SLOW THE TRUCK UNTIL IT STOPS. THIS HAPPENED TO ME TWICE YESTERDAY (7/14/17). THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED I ALMOST CAUSED AN ACCIDENT BEHIND ME WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKES. THE SECOND TIME I WAS IN THE SLOW LANE AND WAS ABLE TO GET ON THE SHOULDER TO DECELERATE. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME MY WIFE WAS WITH ME WHEN THIS HAPPENED AND SHE SAID IF SHE WAS DRIVING SHE WOULD HAVE LOST CONTROL OF THE TRUCK. I UNDERSTAND FROM SPEAKING WITH OTHER FORD F-250 4X4 OWNERS THAT THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE. IS ANYTHING BEING DONE TO REMEDY THIS ISSUE. I DID NOT SEE ANY RECALL FOR THIS ON YOUR SITE OR ON FORD'S SITE. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT AT THE LOCAL FORD DEALER, NEXT WEDNESDAY TO HAVE THEM CHECK THE FRONT SUSPENSION FOR ANY DEFECTS BUT I WANTED TO ADD MY NAME TO WHAT I AM SURE IS A LONG LIST OF PEOPLE WITH THE SAME COMPLAINT. DOES SOMEBODY HAVE TO DIE BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE BEFORE IT IS ADDRESSED?",
