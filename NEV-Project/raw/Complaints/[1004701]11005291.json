ONE OF THE FOUR SPRING PACKS CAME APART ON THE INTERSTATE CAUSING THE AXLE TO BECOME MISALIGNED AND NEARLY CAUSING US TO DRIVE OVER THE EDGE OF A GUARDRAIL ON A NARROW BRIDGE WITH TWO LANES AT 50MPH. THIS IS THE 3RD LIPPERT SPRING FAILURE WE HAVE HAD, BUT THE 6TH SUSPENSION FAILURE. UPON INSPECTION WE ALSO HAVE DISCOVERED THAT EACH TIME THE BRONZE BUSHINGS ARE PREMATURELY, COMPLETELY, WORN THROUGH SO THAT THERE IS NO ANTI-FRICTION SURFACE REMAINING. PICTURES ATTACHED.",
