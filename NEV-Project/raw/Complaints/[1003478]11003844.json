I DID A SEARCH TO SEE IF THIS WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM AND THERE ARE TONS OF  COMPLAINTS AND PICTURES ON THE INTERNET SO I WAS AMAZED TO SEE THAT THERE ARE NO RECALLS . MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE ISSUE TAKEN CARE OF UNDER THE 8 YEAR 80,000 MILE EMISSIONS WARRANTY . THE ONLY PROBLEM IS  MANY PEOPLE ( INCLUDING MYSELF ) ARE PAST THE 8 YEARS EVEN THOUGH WAY UNDER THE MILEAGE . MY TRUCK IS PRACTICALLY BRAND NEW INSIDE AND OUT AND HAS BEEN SPARINGLY USED AND STILL NOW I HAVE HARMFUL EXHAUST FUMES LEAKING OUT AND THE TRUCK IS ROBBED OF POWER .",
