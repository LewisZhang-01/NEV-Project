        "summary": "AS OTHERS HAVE NOTED, THE DCT SEEMS TO HAVE A SEVERE PROBLEM WHEN TRYING TO QUICKLY ACCELERATE FROM A STOPPED POSITION.  THE CAR WILL GENERALLY CREEP FORWARD A FEW FEET AT A VERY SLOW CRAWL OF 1-2 MPH, BUT WILL NOT ACTUALLY TAKE OFF UNTIL 3-5 SECONDS INTO PUSHING THE PEDAL.  THIS BEHAVIOR OF THE CAR CAN CAUSE YOU TO BE OUT IN ONCOMING TRAFFIC FOR UPWARDS OF 5-7 SECONDS OR LONGER.    THIS IS A VERY SEVERE SAFETY ISSUE AS A CAR SHOULD NEVER HAVE A DELAY IN ACCELERATION OF MORE THAN 1-2 SECONDS LET ALONE 5 OR MORE.  I HAVE BEEN IN SEVERAL NEAR ACCIDENTS DUE TO HIS WHEN TRYING TO MAKE LEFT HAND TURNS ON BUSY STREETS APPEARING AS I AM INTENTIONALLY CREEPING INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC LIKE I WANT TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT AND NOT MOVING.    I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO THE DEALER AND ONE OF THE SERVICE INDIVIDUALS STATED TO ME THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM, BUT THERE IS NO FIX.  HE SUGGESTED REPROGRAMMING THE TCM (I WILL BE MAKING AN APPOINTMENT TO DO THIS WHEN I HAVE TIME TO LEAVE THE CAR), BUT HE DID TELL ME HE HAS NOT SEEN MUCH SUCCESS WITH THE REPROGRAMMING OR THAT THERE MIGHT BE IMPROVEMENT FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WITH RETURN OF THE ISSUE.    MY WIFE WILL NOT EVEN DRIVE THE CAR BECAUSE SHE HAS NO TRUST THAT SHE WILL NOT GET KILLED IN OUR AREA WITH BUSY STREETS.  MY FATHER OWNS A REPAIR SHOP IN ANOTHER AREA OF OUR STATE AND WE ARE RECOMMENDING TO ANYONE TO STAY AWAY FROM ANY OF THE HYUNDAI VEHICLES AT THIS TIME AS THE COMPANY DOES NOT APPEAR TO CARE ABOUT SAFETY IF THIS IS A KNOW ISSUE WITHOUT A SOLUTION.",
