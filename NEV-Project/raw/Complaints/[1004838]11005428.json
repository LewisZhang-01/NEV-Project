ALMOST HIT THE CAR AHEAD OF ME. BRAKING WAS THE SAME FOR THE NEXT 4 MILES TILL I GOT HOME. HAD TO STEP ON THE PEDAL ALL THE WAY TO THE GROUND TO STOP. THE LOW BRAKE FLUID LIGHT CAME ON THE DASH. AFTER PARKING THE CAR I CHECKED OUT THE BRAKE FLUID RESERVOIR AND IT WAS EMPTY. FILLED IT UP WITH DOT 3 FLUID AND CAME BACK ABOUT 10 MINUTES LATER AND THERE WAS A PUDDLE UNDER WHERE THE BRAKE ACTUATOR IS.",
