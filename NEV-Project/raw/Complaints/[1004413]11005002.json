WE DON'T HAVE AN EXTRA CAR FOR HIM TO DRIVE.  WE WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT IF WE KNEW AND THE DEALER PROBABLY KNEW.   MY HUSBAND DRIVES A TOYOTA TACOMA THAT HAS THE SAME PROBLEM.   I FIGURED I'LL JUST DEAL WITH IT RIGHT AWAY AND WAS TOLD THAT THE NEW AIRBAGS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL THE END OF 2017.  MY SON IS A NEW DRIVER, THIS WILL MAKE IT THE LONGEST WORRISOME 5-6 MONTHS.",
