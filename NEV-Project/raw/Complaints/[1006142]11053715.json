IT HAPPENED THRICE WITHIN SPAN OF 20 MINUTES. EACH TIME I STARTED THE CAR AND TRIED TO BRAKE FOR THE 1ST TIME, IT WOULDN'T STOP AND ROLLED OVER FOR ATLEAST 3-5 FEET EVEN WHEN I HAD THE BRAKES PRESSED TO THE FLOOR. THANKFULLY IT WAS ON INTERNAL ROADS AND I WAS AT 15 MPH ANTICIPATING STOP SIGNS AT INTERSECTIONS. IT HASN'T HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE DURING LAST YEAR WINTER SEASON, SO NOT SURE WHAT IS CAUSING IT.",
