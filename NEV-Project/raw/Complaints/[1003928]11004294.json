THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT DESCRIBED IN SERVICE BULLETIN 10-048 AS A RESULT OF HOW THE BLOCK WAS CAST. THE SERVICE BULLETIN EXTENDS WARRANTY OF THE ENGINE BLOCK TO 10 YEARS FROM THE PURCHASE DATE BUT MY 2006 CIVIC FALLS OUTSIDE OF THE WARRANTY RANGE RIGHT NOW AND AMERICAN HONDA REFUSED TO COVER THE REPLACEMENT COST. THE ENGINE REPLACEMENT COST IS NOW WORTH MORE THAN THE VALUE OF THE CAR. THE ISSUE HAPPENED JUST GETTING OFF THE HIGHWAY. THE HEAT GAUGE SHOT ALL THE WAY UP AND THE ENGINE SEIZED WITH WHITE SMOKE COMING OUT. THERE WERE NO INDICATORS ON THE DASH PRIOR TO THIS SO IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO NOTICE COOLANT LEAKING.",
