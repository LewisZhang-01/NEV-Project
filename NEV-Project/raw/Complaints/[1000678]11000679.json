I HAVE TRIED MULTIPLE DEALERSHIPS TO FIX AND THEY HAVE TRIED ALL THE TSB'S THAT APPLY TO THE 2011-15'S, BUT SEEM TO NOT WORK ON THE 2016. THEY HAVE RESEALED THE VEHICLE AT LEAST 3 TIMES, REPLACED THE EXHAUST SYSTEM, AND OTHER PARTS, AND WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE THEY'VE TRIED, BUT STILL WITH NO RESOLUTION. I'M TAKING IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP YET AGAIN TOMORROW, BUT REFUSE TO TAKE THIS VEHICLE BACK HOME UNTIL THE SMELL IS COMPLETELY GONE, WHICH SEEMS TO BE AN IMPOSSIBLE FEAT AT THIS POINT. I HAVE A CASE OPEN WITH FORD, BUT HAVE NOT NOT MADE ANY PROGRESS WITH THEM EITHER (OVER 6 WEEKS). PLEASE DO WHAT YOU CAN TO GET THEM TO MAKE A RECALL ASAP BEFORE I BECOME ONE OF THOSE SOCCER MOMS THAT PASSES OUT BEHIND THE WHEEL WITH HER KIDS AND DOGS IN THE CAR AND THEY MAKE A LIFETIME MOVIE ABOUT HOW MY HUSBAND CAN NO LONGER LIVE WITHOUT US :)",
