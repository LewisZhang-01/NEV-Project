WENT TO LUNCH AND SMELLED FUEL AGAIN ONLY STRONGER NOW, WHEN I BACKED OUT OF THE PARKING SPACE TO RETURN TO WORK I NOTICED A LARGE WET SPOT UNDER MY CAR, GOT OUT AND LOOKED UNDER MY CAR, COULD SEE BOTTOM OF FUEL TANK WAS WET. DROVE TO WORK, REMOVED MY REAR SEAT TO ACCESS TOP OF TANK, NOTICED FUEL WAS LEAKING OUT OF TOP OF FUEL PUMP WHEN THE KEY IS TURNED ON, WENT TO HONDA DEALER NEAR MY WORK AND PURCHASED A PUMP, PARTS ASSOCIATE MENTIONED THEY FAIL REGULARLY, SEEMS TO ME THERE SHOULD BE SOME SORT OF RECALL FOR A FUEL LEAK THAT HAPPENS REGULARLY.",
