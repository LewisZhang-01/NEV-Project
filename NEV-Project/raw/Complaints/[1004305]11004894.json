        "summary": "NHTSA ACTION NUMBER: DP15001  COMPONENTS STEERING  OPENED FROM: APRIL 1, 2015'PRESENT    FORD  IS REFUSING TO HONOR A RECALL FOR THE POWER STEERING SAYING THEY DID A COMPUTER UPDATE INSTEAD.  STEERING COLUMN FAILED 9,829 MILES LATER.  VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION WHEN IT FAILS WHILE DRIVING.  FORD KNEW THIS PART WAS DEFECTIVE BUT STILL ALLOWED IT TO GO UNFIXED.  THE RECALL RESULTED IN A COMPUTER UPDATE TO PROVIDE WARNING SIGNAL AND LIGHT TO TELL YOU THAT THE PART HAS FAILED.  I DO NOT HAVE ANY WARNING LIGHTS OR ALARMS AND I SUSPECT THE COMPUTER UPDATE WAS NOT COMPLETED.  GOOGLE SEARCHES RESULTED IN THOUSANDS OF  VEHICLES WITH THIS PROBLEM EVEN AFTER THE UPDATE HAVE THE SAME FAILURE.  I HOPE NO ONE DIES FROM FORDS IRRESPONSIBILITY AND POOR QUALITY VEHICLES.  I REPORTED ALL THIS TO FORDS REP WHO BASICALLY DID NOT WANT TO HEAR IT.  I ASKED TO SPEAK TO A SUPERVISOR AND WAS TOLD WHY BOTHER WE ARE NOT GOING TO HELP YOU.  A SUPERVISOR DID CALL BACK A DAY LATER BUT HAD THE SAME ATTITUDE THAT THE CUSTOMER IS NEVER RIGHT AND DID NOT CARE IF WE EVER BOUGHT A FORD PRODUCT AGAIN.  JUST DO A GENERAL FORD SEARCH AND ITS NOT JUST MY MARINER BUT MANY DIFFERENT MODELS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.  IT APPEARS THAT THE ONLY RECOURSE WE HAVE IS WITH THE NHTSA ORDERING A RECALL TO FIX THIS PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED OR INJURED.  IT MUST BE QUITE A WINDFALL FOR FORD TO CHARGE ALL THEIR CUSTOMERS $1500.00 TO FIX A MILLION CARS OR MORE.  DID THEY DO THIS ON PURPOSE TO MAKE MORE MONEY.  IF ANYONE HAS MORE INFORMATION ON THIS PLEASE EMAIL ME AT XUSA@EMBARQMAIL.COM",
