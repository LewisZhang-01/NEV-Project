EVERYTHING LOCKS UP AND YOU ATTEMPT TO MAKE IT SAFELY TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. ALL DASH LIGHTS WORK BUT CAR WON'T START. FOUND SAME COMPLAINTS ON INTERNET AND YOUTUBE BUT NO RECALL. TOOK TO LOCAL FORD DEALER AND THEY CANNOT FIND THE ISSUE. THE DIAGNOSTIC MACHINE DID NOT ISSUE A CODE. I EXPLAINED IN DETAIL THE ISSUE AND ASKED FOR DOCUMENTATION OF THE ISSUE. THE PAPER THEY GAVE ME SAID RUNS ROUGH WHEN AC IS ON. I SAID THAT IS NOT THE ISSUE. THEY SAID DON'T WORRY THE TICKET IS STILL OPEN IN THE SYSTEM. I ASKED IF THEY COULD PUT A READER ON THE CAR WHILE DRIVEN TO CATCH THE DIAGNOSTIC CODE AND THEY SAID NO. SO I AM IN SAME SITUATION AS OTHER OWNERS WHERE MY SAFETY AND OTHERS ARE AT STAKE EACH TIME THIS CAR SHUTS OFF. ALSO DEALER SAID THEY H HORN WITH A SCREWDRIVER TO MAKE IT WORK FOR NOW. SO NO HORN, TAIL LIGHT AND CAR SHUTTING OFF INTERMITTENTLY ARE SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUES. FORD NEEDS TO RECALL THIS PROBLEM AND FIX IT!",
