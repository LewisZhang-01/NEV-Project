WHILE BACKING UP THE TRUCK IS LOCKING UP ON ME, AND THE STEERING WHEEL IS JERKING OUT OF MY HANDS, WHICH WILL DYE OUT AS WELL. WHEN I GO TO START IT BACK UP THE TRUCK THEN GIVES ME AN ERROR MESSAGE OF ROLL DOWN THE DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW THAT YOU HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO CLEAR IT OUT. I'VE CURRENTLY HAD THIS AT THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP THE PAST 6 MONTHS WITHOUT THEM BEING ABLE TO FIX THIS NUMEROUS TIMES.",
