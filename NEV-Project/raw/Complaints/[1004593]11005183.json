MY DAUGHTER SAID IT SOUNDED LIKE AN EXPLOSION IN THE TRUNK. THE SPRING WILL BE REPLACED. THESE SPRINGS ARE UNDER TREMENDOUS STRESS AND A FAILURE LIKE THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN AS THE RISK OF SERIOUS INJURY IF IT HAPPENED WHILE OPENING THE TRUNK COULD BE GREAT. A VERY FRIGHTENING INCIDENT FOR MY DAUGHTER WHILE SHE WAS DRIVING. I'VE ORDERED THE PARTS AND A SPECIAL TOOL AND I WILL REPLACE BOTH SPRINGS. NO EVIDENCE OF A DEFECT WAS SPOTTED.",
