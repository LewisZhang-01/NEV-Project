I HAD IT CHECKED OUT AT ANOTHER SHOP AND THEY RESET MY LIGHT.  IT COME BACK ON APPROXIMATELY EVERY MONTH.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT IS SUSPICIOUS THAT I NEVER HAD ANY SUCH PROBLEM UNTIL THE HONDA DEALER REPLACED THE AIR BAG.  THEY REFUSE TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND INSIST IT IS NOT THERE RESPONSIBILITY.  COINCIDENCE I DON'T THINK SO. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUED WITH OTHER HONDA OWNERS WHO HAVE UNDERGONE THIS PROCEDURE",
