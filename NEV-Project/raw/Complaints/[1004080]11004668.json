IT CLAIMS THAT IT IS A DESIGN FLAW AND DOESN'T HURT THE ENGINE. ACCORDING TO THEM, THE OIL DRAINS FROM THE PART OVERNIGHT AND THE \"NOISE\" IS CAUSED BY LACK OF OIL TO THAT PART. AS SOON AS THE PART GETS OIL IT STOPS. (ABOUT 2-3 SECONDS) ACCORDING TO RESEARCH I'VE DONE ON THE INTERNET, THE ISSUE HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR SEVERAL YEARS WITHOUT A FIX AND IS SOMEWHAT COMMON. I BOUGHT THE CAR IN APRIL AND DIDN'T EXPERIENCE THE PROBLEM UNTIL LATE FALL. IT TOOK ME MONTHS TO PROVE TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM.SHAME ON HONDA. I'VE OWNED HONDA CARS AND HAVE BEEN LOYAL TO HONDA FOR 25 YEARS, BUT NO LONGER.",
