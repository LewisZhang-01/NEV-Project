        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING MY VEHICLE ON A CITY STREET (SPEED LIMIT 45MPH), AND WHILE IN A TURN, MY POWER STEERING ABRUPTLY FAILED CAUSING ME TO ALMOST CRASH. I WAS ABLE TO RECOVER AND CONTINUE STEERING USING MY BODY WEIGHT TO ASSIST IN STEERING WHICH WAS VERY DIFFICULT. THE POWER STEERING WOULD THEN BEGIN TO WORK AGAIN, HOWEVER IT WOULD CONTINUE TO FAIL INTERMITTENTLY, SUDDENLY, AND WITHOUT WARNING. I WAS ABLE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT AT MY LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP WHERE THEY INFORMED ME THAT MY POWER STEERING UNIT ITSELF WAS FINE, HOWEVER IT HAD A FAULTY SENSOR THAT WAS CAUSING THE UNIT TO INTERMITTENTLY FAIL. I WAS TOLD THAT THE SENSOR WAS UNREACHABLE AND THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO REPLACE IT, SO I WOULD HAVE TO PURCHASE AND HAVE THEM INSTALL A BRAND NEW POWER STEERING UNIT. THIS COST ME AROUND $2000 TO REPLACE A POWER STEERING UNIT THAT WAS DESIGNED WITH AN IRREPLACEABLE SENSOR.",
