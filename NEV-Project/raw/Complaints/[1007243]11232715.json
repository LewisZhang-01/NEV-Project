        "summary": "I BOUGHT A 2013 NISSAN ALTIMA IN 2017. 4 MONTHS AFTER THE PURCHASE WITH ONLY 65,000 MILES THE CAR STALLED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY WITH MY CHILDREN IN IT. I WAS ABLE TO GET IT RESTARTED AND THE NEXT DAY WHILE WORKING THE TRANSMISSION GAVE OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF A PARKING LOT. THE CVT TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED AT THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP. NOW 65,000 MILES LATER THE NEW CVT TRANSMISSION DIED WHILE I HAD A YOUTH CLIENT IN MY CAR FOR WORK. THIS IS EXTREMELY UNSAFE FOR A TRANSMISSION TO FAIL AT THE DROP OF A HAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. THERE IS CURRENTLY A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST NISSAN DUE TO THIS ISSUE. THIS IS EFFECTING MY WORK AND IS NOT A RELIABLE CAR. THIS NEEDS TO BE RECALLED. ALSO THE AIR COMPRESSOR IS AN ISSUE AS WELL. THIS ALSO  NEEDS RECALLED. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THESE ISSUES. WHAT IF THE CAR WOULD STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF A ROAD AND SOMEONE WOULD HIT ME WHILE I AM WITH MY CHILDREN OR A CLIENT? THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO PLEASE. BECAUSE NISSAN IS REFUSING TO HELP ME AT ALL FOR THIS SECOND TRANSMISSION THAT IS ONLY 2 YEARS OLD!!!!",
