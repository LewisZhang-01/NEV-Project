THE HEADLIGHTS WILL ALSO TURN ON AND OFF BY THEMSELVES PERIODICALLY WITH NO WARNING OR ABILITY TO CONTROL THEM. WHEN IT RAINS MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS AND HEADLIGHTS ARE UNPREDICTABLE AND I CAN NOT DRIVE SAFELY. I BELIEVE THESE ISSUES MAY BE IN CONNECTION TO THE RECENT NHTSA RECALL #16V-668 MANUFACTURER RECALL #S61. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE JULY OF 2016 AND HAPPENS WHENEVER MY CAR IS TURNED ON. AT THIS POINT IN TIME, CHRYSLER AUTOMOTIVE HAS FAILED TO REMEDY THE SITUATION.",
