THE CAR WILL START TO JERK AND IDLE VERY ROUGHLY IN WHICH A FEW TIMES IT HAS CUT OFF ON ME, ONCE TRYING TO EXIT THE HIGHWAY. HAD IT CHECKED OUT BY CERTIFIED VW DEALER WHERE THE CAR WAS BOUGHT, AND I WAS TOLD IT WAS A FAULTY N205 VALVE. HAD THE VALVE REPLACED AND 2 DAYS LATER THE CAR IS DOING THE EXACT SAME THING. TOOK IT BACK AND DEALER ONCE AGAIN SAID THEY FIXED THE PROBLEM BY ADJUSTING SENSORS, BUT STILL THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING.",
