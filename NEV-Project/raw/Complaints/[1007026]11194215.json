I TOOK IT INTO A DODGE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID IT WAS MY BATTERY AFTER THAT I HAD THEM CHANGE THE BATTERY. AFTER MAYBE A DAY I WENT TO WORK AND THE CAR SHUT OFF ON ME AGAIN. I THEN GOT AN OIL CHANGE AND THE CAR WORKED GOOD FOR A FEW MONTHS UNTIL I CAME UPON THE PROBLEM AGAIN THE CAR SHUT OFF ON ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY. I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS THE OIL BECAUSE WHEN IT HAPPENS I CHANGE MY OIL AND THE CAR IS FINE AFTER. I CHANGED MY OIL RECENTLY AND MY CAR IS STILL EXPERIENCING ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS THE BATTERY LIGHT TURNS ON AND IT IS A HASSLE TO TURN THE CAR BACK ON. I HAVE READ A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ON PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SAME CAR AS ME IT IS A BIG SAFETY HAZARD TO BE STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH MY CAR ESPECIALLY SINCE I KEEP UP WITH THE VEHICLE MAINTENANCE AND IT ONLY HAS AROUND 40,000 MILES ON IT.  *TR",
