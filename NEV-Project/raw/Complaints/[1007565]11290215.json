        "summary": "THERE'S A KNOWN ISSUE WITH 2015+ BMW F80 M3 S55 ENGINE. THE ISSUE IS THE CRANK HUB SPINNING OUT AND DAMAGING THE CAR. IT LEAVES THE VEHICLE IN A DANGEROUS STATE WHEN  DRIVING ON THE ROAD AND TO OTHERS NEAR BY. THIS ISSUE HAPPENS TO STOCK VEHICLES AND MODDED ONES. IF THE CRANK HUB SPINS WHILE THE CAR IS MOVING, IT CAN LEAVE THE CAR IN A  DANGEROUS STATE WITH NO POWER. LINKS ABOUT IT: HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/RESULTS... SPECIFIC VIDEO THAT EXPLAINS THE CRANK HUB ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL OF A CAR:  HTTPS://YOUTU.BE/SJR3ZHEGS_U?T=160    THIS ISSUE HAS PERSONALLY HAPPENED ON MY M3. I WAS COASTING DOWN A HILL TOWARDS A GREEN STOPLIGHT, AND A DRIVETRAIN MALFUNCTION ERROR POPPED UP ON MY SCREEN. I IMMEDIATELY PUSHED IN THE CLUTCH, AND WITHIN 1 SECOND MY ENGINE TURNED OFF. MY CAR WAS LEFT WITH NO POWER, THE ENGINE WOULD NOT RESTART. I GOT THE CAR HOME BY TOWING IT, THEN USING A WINCH TO GET IT IN MY GARAGE. I USED MY OBD2 READER TO READ THE DTC'S AND ALL THE CODES THAT CAME UP WERE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE CRANK HUB SPINNING.     IT WAS DANGEROUS BECAUSE I WAS APPROACHING A BUSY INTERSECTION. I HAD TO PUSH MY CAR OUT OF THE INTERSECTION.    I WAS NOT INJURED, I DID NOT CRASH, AND I DID NOT LOSE CONTROL. ALTHOUGH IF I WAS GOING AT A HIGHER RATE OF SPEED, IT WOULD BE EASY TO LOSE CONTROL FROM THIS ISSUE.",
