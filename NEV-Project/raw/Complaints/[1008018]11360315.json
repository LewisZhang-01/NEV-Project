        "summary": "THIS OCCURRED THIS PAST SATURDAY IN A NORDSTROM RACK PARKING LOT IN DALLAS. MY REASON FOR BEING AT THIS SHOPPING CENTER WAS TO DO A QUICK RETURN AT NORDSTROM'S RACK.  I OPENED THE BACK DOOR OF MY TESLA AND GRABBED MY RETURN.  I WALKED AWAY FROM MY CAR, BELIEVING THAT THE SMART LOCKING SYSTEM WOULD SECURE THE CONTENTS OF THE CAR AND THE VEHICLE ITSELF. I WAS IN THE STORE FOR APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN MINUTES.  WHEN I RETURNED TO MY CAR AND OPENED THE BACK PASSENGER DOOR TO PUT IN THE EMPTY NORDSTROM'S BAG, THERE WAS A MAN HIDING IN MY BACK SEAT, UNDER MY DOG'S BLANKET.  HE WAS WEARING BLACK GLOVES AND WAS HOLDING MY TESLA CHARGER IN HIS HANDS. I SCREAMED AND TWO YOUNG GIRLS CAME OVER TO TRY TO HELP.  WE BACKED AWAY FROM THE VEHICLE.  THE MAN THEN CRAWLED INTO MY TRUNK FROM THE BACK SEAT, POPPED OPEN THE TRUNK FROM THE INSIDE AND CLIMBED OUT.  HE LOOKED AT ME, SHAKING HIS HEAD, AND CALLED ME CRAZY OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHILE SECURITY WAS PRESENT.  HE WANDERED AWAY FOR AN HOUR AND FORTY-FIVE MINUTES.  SECURITY KEPT AN EYE ON HIM WHILE WAITING FOR DALLAS POLICE TO ARRIVE.  POLICE CAUGHT UP WITH HIM AFTER HE WANDERED BACK TO THE SAME VICINITY. THE POLICE TOOK A CASE REPORT, FOUND OUT THAT THE SUSPECT HAD WARRANTS OUT FOR HIS ARREST, HANDCUFFED THE MAN AND PUT HIM INTO THE POLICE CAR.  I DON'T FEEL SAFE WHEN I LEAVE MY VEHICLE, AND THIS SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED. HERE ARE MY ISSUES: OBVIOUSLY, MY DOORS DID NOT LOCK AS SOON AS I CLOSED THEM.  THERE IS ABOUT A FIVE TO TEN SECOND PAUSE UNTIL I COMPLETELY WALK AWAY FROM THE CAR BEFORE IT ACTUALLY LOCKS.  THAT IS HOW THIS MAN GOT INTO MY BACK SEAT.  HE COULD HAVE STRANGLED ME WITH MY CHARGER, RAPED ME, AND THEN KILLED ME, AND NOT ONE PERSON WOULD HAVE EVER SEEN HIM. I AM NOT SURE HOW I SHOULD PROCEED.  I DO KNOW THAT EVERY TESLA OWNER SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS DANGEROUS OCCURRENCE.",
