THE ODOR IS STRONG ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU FEEL NAUSEOUS AND LIGHT HEADED. I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP WHERE IT WAS PURCHASED ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS. ON ONE VISIT THEY CLAIMED THEY HAD INSTALLED ADDITIONAL VENTS TO ELIMINATE THE FUMES. THE SECOND TIME, THE EXHAUST WAS REPORTEDLY REPLACED. NEITHER REPAIR CREATED ANY IMPROVEMENT IN REGARD TO THE SMELL.    ADDITIONALLY, I HAVE EXPERIENCED ISSUES WITH THE FRONT SUSPENSION/STEERING AREA. THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN TAKEN BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE(S). THE VEHICLE HAS A LOUD POPPING SOUND THAT EMANATES FROM THE RIGHT FRONT AXLE AREA WHEN MAKING A LOW SPEED TURN. THE FIRST REPAIR WAS REPORTEDLY A LOOSE \"BOOT COVER\". THE SECOND REPAIR CONSISTED OF THE INSTALLATION OF A \"SHIM\" TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. NEITHER FIX TOOK CARE OF THE ISSUE LONG TERM.",
