THE DEALER SAID IT WAS THE RECALLED PART THAT WENT BAD. NOW THEY ARE SAYING ITS NOT AND HYUNDAI USA ISN'T STANDING BY THEIR PRODUCT EITHER SAID I WAS OUT OF WARRANTY BY 5000 MILES AND THEY CAN'T FIX IT. ITS ALL ON ME NOW. HYUNDAI USA FIRST TOLD ME THEY WOULD MEET ME HALF WAY FOR THE REPAIRS BUT THEY DIDN'T ALL THEY DID IS GIVE ME 1000 HYUNDAI POINTS AND THAT IS MAYBE A 1/5 OF THE REPAIR. I HAD A SECOND OPINION DONE AT MIDAS IN MOUNT PLEASANT SC DONE AND THEY ARE SAYING ITS THE RECALLED PART THAT IS BAD, AND THAT I NEED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH Y'ALL. THE WHOLE BRAKING SYSTEM WENT BAD WHILE I WAS DRIVING IT, I WAS GOING AROUND A TURN AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND NOTICED THAT WHEN I PRESSED THE BRAKES THEY WEREN'T RESPONDING SO I THREW IT INTO MANUAL DRIVE, WHERE I GEARED IT DOWN TO 2ND GEAR AND SLOWED DOWN THAT WAY, ENOUGH I WOULDN'T RUN OFF THE ROAD AND MAYBE HURT MYSELF, MY RIDER OR SOMEONE ON THE INTERSTATE.",
