THERE WAS A LOUD NOISE AND I THOUGHT I BLEW A TIRE, THE ENGINE SEIZED UP AND I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, I HAD TO CALL EMERGENCY ROAD SERVICE TO GET MY MOTHER AND I SAFELY HOME. AFTER GETTING THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE KIA DEALERSHIP I AM TOLD THE ENGINE IS NEEDING TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE A ROD WAS THROWN THREW THE MOTOR. WE WERE VERY LUCKY THAT NEITHER ONE OF US WAS INJURED WITH THIS INCIDENT HOWEVER OTHERS MAY NOT BE SO LUCKY.",
