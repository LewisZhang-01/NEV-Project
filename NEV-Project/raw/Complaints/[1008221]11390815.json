I RELEASED MY FOOT FROM THE BRAKE SO AS TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE INTERSECTION. INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR LIGHTS REMAINED ON HOWEVER THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT MOVE. I COULD NOT TURN THE SHIFT KNOB OUT OF DRIVE, EVEN AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS. DEPRESSING THE GAS PEDAL HAS NO EFFECT. AT SOME POINT I MAY HAVE PRESSED THE BRAKE AND THEN TURNED THE SHIFT KNOB BACK TO PARK. I WAS THEN ABLE TO RESTART THE VEHICLE AND GET OUT OF THE INTERSECTION. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE HOME AFTER BUT THE EXPERIENCE WAS DANGEROUS AND FRIGHTENING.",
