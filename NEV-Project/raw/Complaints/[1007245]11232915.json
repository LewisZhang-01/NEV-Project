THIS HAPPENED WHILE GOING TO THE IN OUR TOWN STORE. I AM SO RELIEVED IT WAS NOT WHILE ON THE FREEWAY. HAD I BEEN ON THE FREEWAY, GOING AT FAST SPEEDS, IF THE CARS BEHIND ME WERE NOT PAYING ATTENTION I COULD HAVE BEEN HIT, OR WORSE KILLED.  WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE SHOP I FOUND OUT THAT IT IS A KNOWN PROBLEM.  IT'S TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN 15-0178, ISSUED ON NOV 2015. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY THERE'S NOT A RECALL?  IS SOMEONE GOING TO HAVE DO DIE FIRST?  ATTACHED IS THE SERVICE RECALL. I'VE CONTACTED FORD, SPOKEN WITH EVERGREEN FORD IN ISSAQUAH (WHERE MY CAR CURRENTLY IS) AND FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HERE IN WASHINGTON STATE.  *TR",
