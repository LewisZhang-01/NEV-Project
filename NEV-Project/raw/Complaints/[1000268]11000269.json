THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE HEADLIGHTS DID NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH LIGHTING TO ILLUMINATE THE ROAD AHEAD. IN ADDITION, THE AUTO HIGH BEAM HEADLIGHTS WERE INTERMITTENT IN ILLUMINATING THE ROAD AHEAD. HOSELTON TOYOTA OF EAST ROCHESTER, NEW YORK WAS CONTACTED ON DIFFERENT OCCASIONS. ON THE FIRST OCCASION, THE DEALER STATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS DESIGNED IN THAT MANNER AND INFORMED THE CONTACT TO GET USED TO THE WAY THE HEADLIGHTS OPERATED.
