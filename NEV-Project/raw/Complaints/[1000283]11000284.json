I HAVE ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS A VERY WELL KNOWN AND COMMON PROBLEM WITH GM VEHICLES AND THAT IT IS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO PASSENGERS IF THE CRACK (THAT IS SHARP PLASTIC) IS TO CUT OR RUPTURE THE AIRBAG IN THE CASE OF AN ACCIDENT. MY VEHICLE HAS ALWAYS BEEN GARAGE KEPT AND NEVER KEPT OUTSIDE. THIS IS A HUGE GM PROBLEM AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS THAT NEED THIS FIXED. THERE ARE EVEN FACEBOOK GROUPS WITH THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM ACROSS MULTIPLE VEHICLES. THIS CRACK LITERALLY HAPPENED OUT OF NO WHERE.",
