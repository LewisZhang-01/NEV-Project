FROM AIR BAG SENSORS GOING OUT AND THE DEALER REFUSING TO COVER THIS TO THE SEAT BEING REPLACED. THE REAR WENT OUT AND HAD TO BE REPLACED. THE AC HAS BEEN REPLACED TWICE. BOTH TIMES CALLED CHEVY ASKING FOR HELP AND WAS DENIED ASSISTANCE. SEATBELT ISSUES. COMPUTER SCREEN ISSUES. TIRE SENOR ISSUES RATTLING IN THE DASHBOARD. I WILL NEVER OWN ANOTHER CHEVROLET PRODUCT AGAIN. THIS IS THE PRIMARY VEHICLE MY HUSBAND DRIVES TO WORK AND BACK HOME. THIS TRUCK IS ONLY 3 YEARS OLD AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY THINK WE HAVE A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AND CHEVY DOESN'T SEEM TO WANNA HELP US. I HATE TO WRITE THE MONTHLY NOTE OUT EACH MONTH PAYING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S ALWAYS BREAKING DOWN. I WILL NEVER OWN ANOTHER CHEVROLET PRODUCT.",
