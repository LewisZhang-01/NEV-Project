I HAVE READ HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ONLINE REGARDING THIS ISSUE AND THE DEFECTIVE PART WHERE THE SEALS CRACK REQUIRING REPLACEMENT. ON TOP OF ALL THAT, ITS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND THE PART IS BACK ORDERED UNTIL SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER 2017. SO NO AC IN THE SUMMER TIME. BRILLIANT. THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL. THE PART IS FAILING WITH NO FIXABLE ALTERNATIVE. PLEASE INVESTIGATE. THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING WITH 1 AND 2 YEAR OLD VEHICLES. THE DEALER IS CHARGING CLOSE TO $2000 TO REPLACE ON TOP OF ALL ELSE. PLEASE RESEARCH THE PROBLEM AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.",
