I'VE INSTALLED NEW HALOGEN BULBS AND CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP REGARDING THIS ISSUE. THEY TELL ME MY LIGHTS ARE WORKING PROPERLY, BUT THEY HAVEN'T DRIVEN M CAR AT NIGHT. THIS SEEMS TO BE A WIDESPREAD ISSUE WITH THIS MODEL.I CAN'T SAFELY OPERATE MY CAR AT NIGHT AND ESPECIALLY IN THE RAIN. I CAN'T SEE THE CURB THUS I CAN'T SEE PEDESTRIANS UNTIL IT'S ALMOST TOO LATE. NISSAN NEEDS TO FIX THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S WITH EVERY ALTIMA.",
