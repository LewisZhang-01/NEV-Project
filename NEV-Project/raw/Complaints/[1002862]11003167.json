        "summary": "THE REAR VIEW MIRROR FELL OFF THE WINDSHIELD WHILE DRIVING DOWN CITY STREET AT 25 MILES PER HOUR.  AFTER FIRST SEEKING HELP AT THE LOCAL AUTO GLASS DEALER WHO TOLD US THEY COULD NOT FIX WE WENT TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE DEALERSHIP TOLD US THE WINDSHIELD HAS TO BE REPLACED TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THIS IS BASED ON A BULLETIN TO THEM FROM THE CHEVY FACTORY.  THE NEW WINDSHIELD WILL TAKE SEVERAL DAYS TO ARRIVE MEANWHILE THE CAR WILL HAVE TO BE DRIVEN FOR AT LEAST A WEEK WITHOUT A REAR VIEW MIRROR UNTIL EVERYTHING CAN BE REINSTALLED. BECAUSE THIS VEHICLES CAMERAS AND SENSORS ARE THERE AS WELL THEUBALL HAVE TO BE RECALIBRATED ONCE THEY ARE REINSTALLED AS WELL.  THE WINDSHIELD ALONE COSTS $570, THERE WILL BE LABOR FOR ALL OF THE AFOREMENTIONED ON TOP OF THAT.  THE MAIN CONCERN IS THE SAFETY OF DRIVING FOR A WEEK WITHOUT PROPER SAFETY EQUIPMENT DUE TO THE FACTORY DEFECT.  THE CHEVY FACTORY BULLETIN THE DEALERSHIP GAVE US LISTS 18 DIFFERENT BUICK, CADILLAC, CHEVY, AND GMC MODELS RANGING FROM 2013-2016 WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM.  THE BULLETIN NUMBER IS #PI1187C.  WE BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL ON THESE VEHICLES FOR THEM TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.  IT'S VERY POOR DESIGN FOR A MIRROR TO FALL OFF A 3 YEAR OLD CAR AND REQUIRING IT TO NEED A WINDSHIELD REPLACED TO FIX, CAUSES A SAFETY ISSUE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO COORDINATE THIS, NOT TO MENTION THE COSTS INVOLVED!",
