I THEN TOOK THE TAURUS TO COCONUT POINT FORD. THEY SAID THAT I NEEDED A NEW STEERING GEAR ASSEMBLY AND MY TAURUS WAS NOT ON THE #15S18 RECALL LIST. I HAVE ENCLOSED MY INVOICE FOR $2,093.45. I TALKED TWICE TO FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE. I MENTIONED THE 445,000 CARS (INCLUDING THE 2013 TAURUS) THAT HAD BEEN RECALLED FOR THIS SAME PROBLEM. \"NOTHING THEY CAN DO!\" NOT A GREAT ANSWER... LOOKING ON THE INTERNET, THERE ARE A LOT OF FORD TAURUS CUSTOMERS THAT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR CARS BEING RECALLED. I AM VERY THANKFUL THAT MY WIFE WAS NOT DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN THIS HAPPENED!",
