IT COMPLETELY STALLED,  IT WAS DIFFICULT TO STEER, BUT LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER SAFELY.  I LOOKED UP THE WARNING LIGHT AND IT SAID IT HAD TO DO WITH THE CRANK SHAFT SENSOR.  THE TRUCK WOULD NOT TURN OVER AND I HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED. MY TRUCK HAS NOW BEEN SITTING AT A DODGE DEALERSHIP FOR 2 MONTHS AND THEY ARE SAYING IT WILL BE ANOTHER MONTH UNTIL THEY MIGHT GET THE CRANKSHAFT SENSOR IN NEEDED TO FIX IT. HERE IS THE THING, DODGE IS WELL AWARE OF THE PROBLEM.  A PROBLEM THAT IS SO WIDE SPREAD THEY LITERALLY DO NOT HAVE ANYMORE PARTS TO FIX IT. THEY HAVE A RECALL FOR IT FOR VEHICLES MANUFACTURED IN THE US WITH A WORK AROUND UNTIL THEY GET PARTS MADE BUT BECAUSE MY TRUCK WAS MANUFACTURED IN CANADA THEY REFUSE  TO PUT MY VIN IN WITH THE RECALL SO THEY CAN USE THE WORK AROUND. I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH DODGE AND HAVE GOTTEN NO WHERE. I HAVE ANOTHER RECALL THAT HAS NOT BEEN FIXED AND THEY SAY CANNOT BE FIXED UNTIL THEY GET THE CRANKSHAFT FIXED. THIS OTHER RECALL THEY HAVE KNOWN ABOUT FOR OVER A YEAR AND THEY WOULD TELL ME TO TAKE IT ON THE HIGHWAY AND DRIVE IT. NOW THEY ARE TELLING ME WHAT A FIRE HAZARD THIS RECALL IS.",
