I HAD TO SWERVE INTO THE MEDIAN TO PREVENT REAR ENDING THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME WHILE TRAVELING AT ROUGHLY 30MPH.  ON THE SCREEN IN THE VEHICLE A WARNING WAS DISPLAYED \"AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING DISABLED..\"  I PULLED INTO A BUSINESS PARK PARKING LOT AND IN ORDER TO STOP THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BRAKE PRESSURE REQUIRED TO BRING THE VEHICLE TO A STOP.  THE CAR WAS PARKED AND SUBSEQUENTLY TOWED TO MY HOME.  ABOUT 5 DAYS LATER THE TESLA SERVICE CENTER IN RENO TOWED THE CAR FOR SERVICE.  WE ARE AWAITING THE RESULTS.",
