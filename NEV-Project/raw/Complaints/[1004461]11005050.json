THIS HAPPENS 2 TO 3 TIMES A WEEK.  THIRD, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CONTINUOUSLY COMES ON AND OFF (AND WHEN I GET IT CHECKED, I AM TOLD SOMETHING ABOUT THE THERMOSTAT, BUT HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH IT OVERHEATING).   FINALLY, THE CRUISE CONTROL ON/OFF BUTTON WILL NOT WORK SOMETIMES.  I HAVE TO PHYSICALLY HIT THE STEERING WHEEL FOR IT TO WORK.   I HAVE READ ABOUT TONS OF RECALLS FOR MY YEAR JEEP, BUT MY VIN NUMBER IS NOT INCLUDED.  I AM STARTING TO THINK IT SHOULD BE.",
