        "summary": "This appears to be a possible PCM relay failure or electrical system malfunction .  This seems to be a documented issue out there on various websites and forums.  I was with my wife and son when the vehicle started running extremely rough and lost nearly all power on a busy roadway.  This caused a very dangerous situation for my family in attempting to get the vehicle off the main roadway.  Multiple dash lights came on and the system advised of \"park brake limited service required\", \"Hill assist not available\" and \"drive modes not available\".  After getting the vehicle off the roadway and parked, the vehicle stalled and would not start or run. I have not taken this to the dealer yet to determine the issue.",
