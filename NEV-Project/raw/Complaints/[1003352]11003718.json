        "summary": "ON 6/21/17, A SUV CAR REAR-ENDED MY VEHICLE WHILE I WAS TRAVELING IN TOWN ABOUT 4-6 MPH BECAUSE I HAD SLOWED DOWN AND WAS PREPARING TO STOP FOR AN AMBER LIGHT.  WHEN THE PERSON HIT MY CAR, MY HEAD AND UPPER BODY WERE VIOLENTLY THRUST FORWARD AND BACK AS MY HEAD HIT NEAR THE BOTTOM AREA OF MY HEADREST.  I HAVE A CONCUSSION AND WHIP LASH.  MY CAR HAS REAR-END AND SIDE DAMAGE.  SHORTLY AFTER I PURCHASED MY NEW CAR IN SEPT. 2016, I COMPLAINED ABOUT MY CONCERN TO THE DEALER, DIRITO BROTHERS IN WALNUT CREEK, CA AND SPOKE TO:  [XXX], SALESPERSON, [XXX], OWNER, [XXX], THE SERVICE MANAGER, AND [XXX], SERVICE CONSULTANT AND TOLD THEM SINCE THE SEAT IS TOO TALL, THE HEADREST DOESN'T GO DOWN ENOUGH TO CRADLE MY HEAD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HEADREST.  I TOLD THEM I WAS AFRAID IF I WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT, MY HEAD COULD POSSIBLY HIT AT OR NEAR THE BOTTOM PART OF THE HEADREST AND I COULD POSSILBLY BE INJURED (WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED).  MY NAME IS [XXX], PH # IS [XXX], EMAIL IS [XXX], AND MY MILEAGE IS 14,739.  I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH VW OF AMERICA, CASE #[XXX] ON 6/30/17.  I TOLD THEM MY MAIN CONCERN WAS SAFETY AND FOR THE PROBLEM TO BE RESOLVED TO PREVENT INJURIES OF THEIR CUSTOMERS IN FUTURE ACCIDENTS.  I SUGGESTED A RECALL AND POSSIBLE COMPENSATION.  TODAY, VW STAFF, [XXX] CONTACTED ME AND TOLD ME THERE WAS NOTHING THEY WOULD DO SINCE THE NHTSA (YOUR AGENCY) SAID VW HEADRESTS MEET AND EXCEED FEDERAL SAFETY STANDARDS.  WHEN I ASKED TO SPEAK TO A SUPERVISOR, [XXX] PLACED ME ON-HOLD AND WHEN SHE RETURNED TO THE PHONE, SHE SAID THE SUPERVISORS WERE ALL IN A MEETING, AND THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE THEY COULD DO.  VW OF AMERICA REFUSED TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY AND OTHERS' SAFETY AND SHOWED NO CONCERN.  THIS IS THE 3RD GOLF VW I'VE OWNED AND I'VE NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM PREVIOUSLY WITH HEADRESTS.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
