LIGHTS ON CRUISE SWITCH AND ELECTRONIC GEAR SHIFT DO NOT ILLUMINATE NOR DOES THE EVIC CONTROL BUTTONS LOCATED ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE OF STEERING WHEEL . I WAS DRIVING AT NIGHT AND WHILE TRYING TO SET THE CRUISE CONTROL, BECAUSE THE LIGHTS WON'T ILLUMINATE I HIT THE GEAR DOWN BUTTON AND DOWNSHIFTED TO 1ST ON THE HIGHWAY WHILE DOING ABOUT 55MPH ALMOST CAUSING A ACCIDENT. FROM RESEARCH  I'VE DONE ONLINE I BELIEVE IT MAY HAVE A BAD CLOCKSPRING AS OTHER OWNERS HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE ON THE SAME AND SIMILAR YEAR MODELS",
