WHEN USING PROPILOT ON MY 2018 NISSAN LEAF SV IN STOP AND GO HIGHWAY TRAFFIC, SOMETIMES WHEN MY NISSAN LEAF COASTS TO AN ALMOST COMPLETE STOP 15 FEET BEHIND A \"BOXY\" VEHICLE LIKE A SEMI-TRUCK, THE LEAF SUDDENLY ACCELERATES LIKE IF THERE IS NO VEHICLE DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME AND IF I AM NOT COMPLETELY ATTENTIVE AND IF I DO NOT IMMEDIATELY APPLY THE BREAKS, THE NISSAN LEAF WOULD REAR END THE SEMI-TRUCK.  THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME 4 TIMES OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS WHEN FOLLOWING A SEMI-TRUCK WITH TRAILER AND THIS MORNING IT OCCURRED AGAIN A FIFTH TIME BUT THIS TIME I WAS BEHIND A SEDAN.  I HAVE A DASHCAM VIDEO OF THE INCIDENT FROM THIS MORNING.  I HAVE REPORTED THIS ISSUE TO NISSAN BUT THEY HAVE DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT.  I HAVE TAKEN MY 2018 NISSAN LEAF IN TO THE LOCAL NISSAN SERVICE CENTER BUT THEY SAY THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE SENSORS AND THEY DO NOT SEE ANY ISSUES AND NO ERROR CODES REPORTED BY THE CAR.  I BELIEVE THIS IS A SOFTWARE PROBLEM WHERE THE SOFTWARE IGNORES THE RADAR IMAGE OF THE TRUCK IN FRONT BECAUSE IT THINKS IT IS AN OVERHEAD SIGN AND NOT ANOTHER VEHICLE IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT, THE CAMERA INPUT OF THE VEHICLE IN FRONT ALSO APPEARS TO BE IGNORED BY THE SOFTWARE IN THIS SITUATION.  ADDITIONALLY, I HAVE HAD AT LEAST TWO INCIDENTS (ALSO OCCURRED  THIS MORNING) WHERE PROPILOT LANE KEEPING FEATURE SHUTS OFF AND AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BREAKING IS ALSO SHUT OFF AND DEACTIVATED FOR AND EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME FOR NOW APPARENT REASON (IN EXCELLENT WEATHER AND CLEAR CONDITIONS, NO OBSTRUCTIONS OF SENSORS, ETC.), I HAVE VIDEO OF THIS AS WELL.",
