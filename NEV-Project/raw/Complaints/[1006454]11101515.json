        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING MY TRUCK ON THE HIGHWAY AT 65 MPH, I ENTERED THE OFF RAMP AND APPLIED PRESSURE ON MY BRAKE PEDAL.  MY BRAKES FAILED AND THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR.  I QUICKLY APPLIED MY PARKING BRAKE, LOCKING UP THE REAR WHEELS.  WITH NO LOAD IN THE BED OF THE TRUCK, I SLID FOR WHAT SEEMED TO BE HUNDREDS OF FEET BEFORE COMING TO A STOP.  FORTUNATELY, THERE WAS NO ONE IN FRONT OF ME DURING THE SKID.  I TOOK IT TO A TIRE REPAIR VENDOR CLOSE BY, AND THEY DIAGNOSED IT AS A MASTER CYLINDER FAILURE THAT ALSO RUINED THE BRAKE BOOSTER.  I CALLED FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND OPENED A CASE FOR MY VEHICLE.  I HAVE READ THAT THE 2013 AND 2014 MODELS OF THE F150 WITH THE 3.5L ENGINE WERE RECALLED FOR THIS PROBLEM, BUT THAT 2015 MODELS SUCH AS MINE HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED AS OF THIS DATE.",
