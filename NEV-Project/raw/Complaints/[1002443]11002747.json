        "summary": "THE POWER STEERING IN MY MINI COOPER 2005 HAS BEEN INTERMITTENT.  THE STEERING WHEEL BECOMES VERY HARD TO TURN ALL OF A SUDDEN, PARTICULARLY AT LOW SPEEDS WHEN IT IS NEEDED THE MOST TO MAKE TURNS OR TO PARK.  THERE ARE NO FAULT INDICATORS FOR THIS ISSUE ON THE DASHBOARD EITHER.   THE VERY FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED IN MARCH 2011 WHEN MY CAR HAD LESS THAN 80,000 MILES ON IT.  THE POWER STEERING BECAME COMPLETELY INOPERABLE.  AT THAT TIME THE DEALER INFORMED ME THAT THE POWER STEERING PUMP FAILURE WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM IN MINI COOPER AND THAT THE PUMP HAD TO BE REPLACED.   THE REPLACEMENT COST WAS TOO HIGH THOUGH, HENCE I CHOSE TO THINK ABOUT IT BEFORE HAVING IT REPLACED.  LUCKILY, THE POWER STEERING STARTED WORKING AGAIN AND EVEN THOUGH STEERING BECAME  A LITTLE HARD AT TIMES I GOT USED TO IT.  BUT SINCE END OF APRIL 2017 THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN GETTING WORSE.  STEERING GETS TOO HARD AT TIMES AND REQUIRES A LOT OF FORCE TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL AT LOW SPEEDS.  GETTING IN AND OUT A COMPACT PARKING SPOT IS EXCEPTIONALLY HARD.    MAKING LEFT, RIGHT AND U TURNS ARE ALSO VERY HARD.  EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A RECALL ON THIS ISSUE, I HAVE NOT RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE IN THE MAIL.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY MY CAR WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.  OR IF THE RECALL IS ONGOING, WHY SHOULD IT TAKE SO LONG SINCE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE.",
