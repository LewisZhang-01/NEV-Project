I HAD SOMEONE PUT A COMPUTER  READER ON THE TRUCK AND IT SAID IT WAS A GEAR SHIFT RATIO FOR GEAR #2.  THE OUT TAKE SENSOR WAS REPLACED WITH A NEW ONE, HOWEVER THAT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.  I DO NOT HAVE ANY OTHER PROBLEMS WITH ANY OTHER GEARS.  ALL OTHERS SHIFT FLAWLESSLY EXCEPT FOR THE AFORE MENTIONED. THANK YOU",
