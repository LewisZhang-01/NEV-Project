        "summary": "A NUMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN SOUTHERN ARIZONA ARE EXPERIENCING ONGOING PROBLEMS WITH 2011-2015 CHEVROLET TAHOE POLICE PURSUIT PACKAGES ON HIGH TEMPERATURE DAYS. THIS ISSUE MANIFESTS ITSELF IN TEMPERATURES ABOVE 100 DEGREES AND FREQUENTLY WHEN THE TAHOE IS ENGAGED IN A LEFT TURN MOVEMENT. THE TAHOE STUTTERS AND/OR STALLS, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ACTIVATES, AND IF THE TAHOE WILL RESTART IT CONTINUOUSLY BACKFIRES, MISSES, AND WILL NOT RUN ABOVE 15MPH FOR A PERIOD. CHEVROLET HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THE ISSUE AND STATES THE SOLUTION IS A HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP AND FUEL LINE WHICH IT DOES NOT HAVE IN STOCK. AT PRESENT, THE PIMA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HAS AT LEAST 10 VEHICLES OUT OF SERVICE FOR THIS ISSUE. ANOTHER LOCAL AGENCY, THE ORO VALLEY POLICE DEPARTMENT, HAS HALF OF ITS FLEET AFFECTED. OTHER AGENCIES EXPERIENCING THESE ISSUES INCLUDE THE PHOENIX POLICE DEPARTMENT, THE SCOTTSDALE POLICE DEPARTMENT, THE MESA POLICE DEPARTMENT, THE MARANA POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND THE MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. CHEVROLET HAS BEEN SLOW TO RESPOND TO THIS ISSUE WHICH DATES TO 2011. CHEVROLET'S STRATEGY APPEARS TO BE ONE OF PACIFYING LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES UNTIL THE HOT SEASON IS OVER AND THEN THE PROBLEM IS IGNORED FOR ANOTHER YEAR. THIS ISSUE IS A SAFETY CONCERN FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FACING THE RISK OF A STALLING VEHICLE WHILE TURNING LEFT IN THE FACE OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. I HAVE PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED THIS ISSUE ON TWO OCCASIONS.",
