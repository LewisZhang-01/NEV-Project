EVEN IF NOT, THIS IS SO DANGEROUS! IF I HADN'T OF RECOGNIZED THE PROBLEM THIS MORNING, I WOULD HAVE BEEN CREAMED BY ABOUT TEN CARS COMING MY WAY. THE FCW LIGHT COMES ON AND THE ENTIRE VEHICLE SHUTS OFF. I HAVE DONE THE CLEANING THING AND OBVIOUSLY THEY KNOW AT THE DEALERSHIP THIS IS AN ISSUE BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. IS IT GOING TO TAKE SOMEONE BEING PLOWED INTO IN ORDER FOR THEM TO HAVE TO FIX IT?",
