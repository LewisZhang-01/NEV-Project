I WAS TOLD IT WAS PROBABLY A \"GLITC\" AND IT WAS OKAY TO DRIVE. HOWEVER, WE TOOK IT INTO A FREIGHTLINER/CUMMINS REPAIR FACILITY TO JUST CHECK IT OUT. THEY FOUND THAT THE OIL PRESSURE WAS FINE, NO PROBLEM WITH THE SENDING UNIT, OR THE DASH INSTRUMENT CLUSTER, SO THEY DROPPED THE OIL PAN. THEY FOUND THAT A THRUST BUSHING HAD FALLEN OFF ONE OF THE CRANKSHAFT BEARINGS AND 2 OF THE MAIN BEARINGS HAD SPUN OUT. HAD WE NOT STOPPED AND TAKEN THE COACH IN TO BE LOOKED AT, THAT ENGINE WOULD HAVE BLOWN APART ON THE HIGHWAY AND POSSIBLY KILLED SOMEONE AND DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE CAUSED MAJOR DAMAGE TO THE COACH. THESE CUMMINS ENGINES HAVE ALREADY BEEN RECALLED ONCE, BUT THE ENGINE SERIAL NUMBERS NEED TO BE EXTENDED. MY ENGINE FALLS JUST OUTSIDE THE RECALL NUMBERS.",
