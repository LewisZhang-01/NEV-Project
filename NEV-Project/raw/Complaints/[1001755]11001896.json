WE GOT IT TO AN ELECTRICAL SHOP TO FIND THE BATTERY WAS DEAD AND THE 180 AMP ALTERNATOR HAD STOPPED OPERATING. AFTER SOME RESEARCHING I FOUND A RECALL (P60) AND IT ONLY APPLIED TO 160 AMP ALTERNATOR. I CALLED CHRYSLER (CASE #31556595) TO SEE IF THEY COULD HELP AND WAS DENIED. WE HAD TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR WHICH COST ME $400.44. I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL.",
