THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT OF ANY KIND OR POTENTIAL REASON FOR IT TO BLOW OPEN. IT WAS A LOUD POPPING SOUND AND STRONG BLOW TO THE BACK OF MY HEAD.  I STOPPED TO ACCESS THE SITUATION AND SAW THAT THE DRIVER HEAD REST HAD POPPED OPEN. I CALLED FIAT CHRYSLER THE NEXT DAY TO FILE A CLAIM.  THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF HAVING THE VEHICLE REPAIRED AT THEIR COST.  I AM STILL EXPERIENCING WIP LASH PAIN 3+ WEEKS LATER AND PLAN OF SEEING A DOCTOR ASAP.",
