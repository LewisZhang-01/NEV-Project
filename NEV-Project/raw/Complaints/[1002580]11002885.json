        "summary": "THE 2.0 ECOBOOST ENGINE IN MY 2017 ESCAPE HAS STALLED TWICE AT LOW SPEEDS. ON 6/18/17 WHILE BACKING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY, THE VEHICLE MOVED APPROXIMATELY SIX FEET AND THE ENGINE STALLED IN REVERSE. ON 6/24/17 THE ESCAPE STALLED IN A SHOPPING CENTER PARKING LOT. THE SUV WAS IN DRIVE, MOVED ABOUT TEN FEET, AND STALLED. AFTER BOTH INCIDENTS, I TOOK THE ESCAPE TO FORD DEALERS FOR THE MECHANICS TO LOOK FOR THE CAUSE OF THE STALLING. THE DEALERSHIPS CAN NOT FIND THE PROBLEM AND MY VEHICLE IS NOT FIXED. THANKFULLY STALLING HASN'T OCCURRED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, BUT IF IT DOES I DREAD THE THOUGHT OF TRYING TO BRING THE VEHICLE UNDER CONTROL WITHOUT ANY POWER STEERING OR BRAKES. THERE HAVE BEEN NO ACCIDENTS OR INJURIES AS OF TODAY.",
