MY MECHANIC WAS THINKING IT WAS THE CHARGING SYSTEM.  (NO CODE WAS REGISTERED FOR A PERIOD OF 2 MONTHS.)    TODAY, IT PULLED A P0231 CODE.  MUCH TO MY SURPRISE THERE SEEMS TO BE FACTUAL THINGS DOCUMENTED ALL OVER THE INTERNET.    I AM TAKING THE CAR TO CHEROKEE AUTO TECH.  VINCENT NGUYEN IS A REGISTER SAE TECH WITH A MECHANICAL ENGINERING DEGREE.  HE ALSO DISCOVERED THE IGNITION CYLINDER ON MY 2003 PONTIAC GRAND AM BEFORE IT WAS AN ISSUE...    THIS CAR IS NOT ANY DIFFERENT.  DURING HIGH PERIODS OF DRIVING, THE SOLDER \"HEATS UP\" AND STALLS THE GAS.  WHEN THE CAR COOLS OFF, THE SOLDER SOLIDIFIES AND CURRENT CAPACITY TO THE FUEL PUMP RESUMES...    THE FUSE IS NOT PROTECTING THE TRACE.    YOU HAVE COMPLAINTS ON YOUR WEBSITE ON THIS MODEL ALSO.    EVEN YOUTUBE VIDEOS....  HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=1BRGVBETKEK    IF IT IS TRUE WITH MY MODEL, I WILL GIVE YOU FACTUAL EVIDENCE THAT YOU NEED.",
