AS SOON AS I DID THAT MY CAR LOST POWER AND A BUNCH OF EMERGENCY LIGHTS CAME ON, I IMMEDIATELY GOT ON THE SHOULDER. NO ONE WAS BEHIND ME OTHERWISE I WOULD'VE BEEN IN A WRECK. I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND ON AGAIN AND THE EMERGENCY LIGHTS WERE STILL THERE. I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE UP TO ABOUT 10 MILES AN HOUR A FEW BLOCKS TO A PARKING LOT. I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME IT WAS MY INVERTER THAT OVER HEATED AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.",
