WHEN I TRIED TO RESTART IT,  THE ENGINE WOULD TURN OVER BUT NOT START. THE CAR WAS TOWED TO A REPAIR PLACE. AFTER A FEW DAYS THE MECHANIC GOT IT RUNNING AND I DROVE IT HOME.  WHEN I TRIED TO START IT SOMETIME LATER, IT WOULD NOT START, JUST LIKE AT THE TRAFFIC LIGHT.  IT WOULD REV UP AND THEN DIE.  IT DID THIS A COUPLE OF TIMES  AND THEN STARTED.  WHEN I TURNED IT OFF AND TRIED TO START IT AGAIN IT WOULD TURN OVER BUT NOT START.  IT WAS TOWED TO A DIFFERENT REPAIR PLACE WHERE THE MECHANIC DIAGNOSED IT AS A BAD IGNITION SWITCH AND TOLD ME THERE WAS A RECALL ON THIS MAKE AND MODEL HONDA. A CHECK WITH THE HONDA DEALER REVEALED THAT THERE WAS NO APPLICABLE RECALL ON THIS VEHICLE; IE., A VEHICLE WITH THE ABOVE VIN.  WHY NOT?? APPARENTLY, FOR SOME REASON MY 1999 HONDA CIVIC LX WAS \"MISSED\" BECAUSE THE PROBLEM I AM HAVING HAS ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS OF  WHAT IS DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL.  WHY WAS THERE A RECALL, MY VEHICLE WAS OMITTED, AND NOW SOME YEARS LATER THE PROBLEM REARS ITS HEAD AND I HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE IT CORRECTED.  IT FAILS TO START RANDOMLY AND IF IT QUITS WHILE I AM DRIVING AND I CAN'T START IT AGAIN, IT IS A SAFETY SITUATION SINCE I LOSE MY POWER BRAKES AND POWER STEERING.",
