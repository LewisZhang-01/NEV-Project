        "summary": "I'M A LONG TIME FORD OWNER.  IN JULY, 2017 THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING ON MY 2013 MUSTANG GT WHICH HAD LESS THAN 40K MILES, MALFUNCTIONED WHICH IN TURN RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF TRACTION CONTROL, ABS AND OTHER ELECTRONIC ASSIST FUNCTIONS. AFTER BEING INFORMED THAT MY WARRANTY WAS EXPIRE, I WAS QUOTED OVER $2.2K. ANNOYED THAT A LOW MILEAGE CAR WHICH WAS LESS THAN 4 YEARS OLD COULD HAVE AN ISSUE LIKE THIS, I CHOSE TO DRIVE IT WITHOUT POWER STEERING.  FAST FORWARD TO JANUARY 2018, I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR AN OIL CHANGE WHICH HAPPENED TO LOSE ALL STEERING FUNCTION WHILE IN THEIR POSSESSION. THE DEALERSHIP EXPLAINED THAT THE CAR WAS A TICKING TIME BOMB AND THAT I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT THE STEERING DIDN'T GO OUT WHILE I WAS ON THE ROAD.  I WAS BLOWN AWAY BECAUSE THEY NEVER INFORMED ME THAT I WOULD LOSE ALL STEERING IN THE ORIGINAL DIAGNOSIS 6 MONTHS EARLIER. I CONTACTED FORD CONSUMER AFFAIRS AND THEY JUST FILED IT AWAY AND DON'T WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE DUE TO THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY IT CAN FACE FOR SELLING CARS WITH FAULTY STEERING THAT ARE LIKELY TO FAIL ON THE ROAD. FORD'S POWER STEERING ISSUES ARE WELL-KNOWN, BUT THE ASSOCIATED CATASTROPHIC STEERING FAILURE IS NOT. BASICALLY, IF YOU DRIVE A FORD PRODUCT AND THE POWER STEERING GOES OUT, YOU ARE DRIVING A DEATH TRAP.",
