        "summary": "We bought our 2017 Tucson with about 40000 miles in 2019. We have had some issues that are to be covered by the warranty. The last was the engine going. I was extremely religious about regular maintenance and always took it to the dealership to have the oil changed and other work every 3000. 2 of the last 4 oil changes cost me over $400 and $600 due to what I thought was work required to maintain the warranty, finding out later that this was false and the service people lied. In the last 4 oil changed I reported excessive oil consumption, 1 qt per 1000 miles at least. They told me this was normal and to be expected. I was 4 hours in to a 8 hour drive when the engine failed. I had checked and filled the oil before I left, in 4 hours it consumed over 3qts. It took me at least a month of dealing with the warranty company to cover as we had a lifetime powertrain warranty. They were not going to cover it due to lack of lubricant. As I told them the engine was failing before this incident. The dealer did not record my requests to find the oil consumption problem. It has now been 4 months, still making car payments and waiting for them to put a used engine in it. We were not offered a choice of whether used or rebuild. This is a known problem and have found class action suits for similar vehicles but for whatever reason earlier and later models are included, same engine and same problem as those part of the class action.",
