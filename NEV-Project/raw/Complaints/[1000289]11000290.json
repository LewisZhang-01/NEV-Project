FIRST, IT STARTED GOING HALF WAY AND SUDDENLY WENT ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO THE DOOR. THE CAR WAS NOT MOVING. I SIMPLY WANTED THE WINDOW SLIGHTLY OPEN. THIS IS A WINDOW I VERY SELDOM USE.  I WAS TOLD BY MECHANICS THAT WORK ON BMW'S, THAT THIS IS A FACTORY DEFECT ON THIS SERIES AND  IT IS HAPPENING A LOT ON THIS SERIES. THE COST TO FIX IT IS ABOUT $300. THIS IS A DEFECT THE BMW COMPANY SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR FIXING. THE BUYER SHOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR DEFECTS.",
