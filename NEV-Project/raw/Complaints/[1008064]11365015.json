TOYOTA SAYS THE SYSTEM SHOULD LAST WELL OVER 100,000 MILES. BUT THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS THAT THE SHOCKS START LEAKING FROM THE CENTER JOINT AT LESS THAN 50,000 MILES. LEAKING SHOCKS NEED TO BE REPLACED AS A FULL SET OF 4. THE COST FOR THIS REPAIR IS PROHIBITIVE, IN EXCESS OF $3000 CURRENTLY. LOSS OF SHOCK PERFORMANCE CAN CAUSE EXCESS BOUNCE AND SWAY, POTENTIALLY CAUSING A CRASH",
