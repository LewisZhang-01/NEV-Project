THIS CAUSES THE STEERING COLUMN TO MOVE OUT OF IT'S SET POSITION WHILE DRIVING WHICH COULD CAUSE A DANGEROUS SITUATION. THIS HAS OCCURRED MANY TIMES SINCE I HAVE OWNED THIS VEHICLE.    I THINK THERE WAS A RECALL ON OTHER YEAR MODELS OF THE TOYOTA AVALON BUT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY 2011 WAS EXCLUDED.",
