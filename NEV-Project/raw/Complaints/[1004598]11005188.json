THEY TOLD ME IT WAS THE TIPM WAS BAD AND THEY HAVE A TON OF THESE VEHICLES WITH THIS PROBLEM! IT IS A VERY EXPENSIVE FIX AND SHOULD BE A RECALL ITEM DUE TO IT BEING A SAFETY PROBLEM!  THE VEHICLE SHUTS DOWN AND YOU LOOSE ALL POWER! I HAVE SEEN ONLINE OTHER ISSUES WHERE THE AIR BAGS ACTUALLY DEPLOYED. I AM SO SCARED TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF IT WILL MALFUNCTION AGAIN!! IT HAS HAPPEN AT LEAST 3 TIMES ALREADY.",
