FORD DID A RECALL ON THIS PART BUT IF YOU WEREN'T HAVING ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT AT THE TIME THEY DID THE RECALL THEY WOULD JUST FLASH YOUR ECU AND CALL IT GOOD.  THIS DOESN'T ACTUALLY PREVENT THE FAILURE FROM HAPPENING.  SO EVENTUALLY THE POWER STEERING FAILS LIKE IT DID TO ME WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY, WHICH IS A KNOWN PROBLEM.  THEY THEN WANT TO CHARGE YOU TO HAVE THE STEERING ANGLE TORQUE SENSOR REPLACED.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND SHOULD BE REPLACED BY FORD AT THEIR EXPENSE.",
