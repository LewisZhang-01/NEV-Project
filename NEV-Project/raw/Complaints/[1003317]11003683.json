THE INTEGRITY OF THE DASH AND AIRBAG ARE PROBLEMATIC. THERE IS NO TANGIBLE SUPPORT UNDER THE DASH -- DEALERSHIP SAYS IT'S PLASTIC!!!  THE VEHICLE WAS NOT IN MOTION, JUST HAPPENED ONE DAY WHEN IT WAS PARKED IN THE DRIVEWAY. YESTERDAY THE OUTSIDE PASSENGER DOOR HANDLE BROKE OFF --- AGAIN, PLASTIC PARTS INSTEAD OF METAL. IF THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT, THAT PASSENGER MIGHT NOT HAVE AN AIRBAG PROPERLY DEPLOYED AND NOBODY COULD OPEN THAT DOOR FROM THE OUTSIDE TO RESCUE THEM!",
