SOMETIMES IT TURNS ON JUST FINE AND SOMETIMES THE KEY ABSOLUTELY REFUSES TO TURN WHEN IN THE IGNITION SWITCH. ITS AS IF IM PUTTING THE WRONG KEY IN THERE BUT I ONLY HAVE ONE VW SO THIS IS FOR SURE THE RIGHT KEY. THE CAR SQUEAKS EXTREMELY LOUD. ITS A REALLY LOUD SCREECHING SOUND AND IT ONLY HAPPENS WHEN I REVERSE. BOTH THINGS ONLY HAPPEN EVERY ONE OUT OF 10 TIMES OR SO.",
