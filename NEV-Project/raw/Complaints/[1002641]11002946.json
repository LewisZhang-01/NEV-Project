THIS IS AN INTERMITTENT ISSUE AND VARIES IN BOTH FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY, AND TYPICALLY OCCURS DURING EACH USE OF THE VEHICLE.  THE MALFUNCTION SEEMS TO OCCUR MORE FREQUENTLY DURING SUSTAINED LEFT TURNS, AND IS MOST PROBLEMATIC ON CURVY ROADS WHERE FAILURE TO STRAIGHTEN WHEELS OR OVER-STEERING TO OPPOSITE SIDE COULD BE CATASTROPHIC.  THE MALFUNCTION OCCURS WHILE IN A TURNING MOTION ON CITY STREETS AND ON CURVY HIGHWAYS, USUALLY WHEN WHEEL IS TURNED MORE THAN ~20 DEGREES AND SUSTAINED BRIEFLY.  THE ISSUE WAS REPORTED TO THE SUBARU DEALER.  THEY DROVE AND INSPECTED THE CAR AND WERE UNABLE TO FIX OR DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM.  THE CAR IS NEW AND WAS RECEIVED ON 06/09/2017.",
