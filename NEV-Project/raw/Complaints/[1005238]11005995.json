I FIND IT OFFENSIVE THAT LEXUS EVEN SUGGESTS THAT NO ONE SIT IN THE PASSENGER SEAT UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS FIXED...REALLY?!  LEXUS SHOULD COMPENSATE THEIR CUSTOMERS FOR THE ANGUISH AND TIME ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROBLEM.  ONE OF THE REASONS I BOUGHT A LEXUS IS BECAUSE OF MINIMAL SAFETY CONCERNS...WILL DEFINITELY CONSIDER THIS ISSUE WHEN PURCHASING A NEW VEHICLE IN THE FUTURE.",
