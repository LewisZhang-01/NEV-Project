We did not hit anything.  It only lasted a few seconds. The car did not go out of the lane, but it was very frightening for myself, and my wife in the front passenger seat.  The Honda Dealer checked the car and could not duplicate the problem, or find a Digital Trouble Code. We have never had any problem with this car prior to this instance.",
