        "summary": "THE SUN VISOR ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF MY 2008 HONDA CIVIC BROKE SEVERAL MONTHS AGO.  I CONTACTED THE DEALER AND TOLD THIS WAS A WARRANTY ITEM AND THE WARRANTY HAD EXPIRED.  I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE PASSENGER SIDE ABOUT A YEAR AFTER I PURCHASED THE CARE IN 2011 AND WAS TOLD IT WAS A RECALL ITEM, AND HAD IT REPLACED FOR FREE.  I WAS TOLD THE DRIVER'S SIDE VISOR WOULD COST $70.00 PLUS TAX TO FIX.  I HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO HAVE IT DONE, SINCE I DON'T INTEND TO KEEP THE CAR MUCH LONGER.  IT CREATES A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE THE VISOR WILL NOT STAY UP AGAINST THE ROOF AND INTERFERES WITH LINE OF SIGHT AT STOP SIGNS, ETC.  IF I MOVE IT TO THE SIDE WINDOW THEN THE SUN HITS ME DIRECTLY IN THE EYES, CREATING ISSUES ALSO.  THANK YOU.",
