        "summary": "VIN: [XXX]       MAKE: FORD F150 2015  ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 20TH 2017, I WAS SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT JOURNALING AND LISTING TO MUSIC. THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED AND RUNNING BECAUSE I WAS LISTENING TO THE RADIO AND ENJOYING THE AIR CONDITIONER. MY HUSBAND HAD DRIVEN THE VEHICLE AND PARKED IT. HE HAD EXITED THE VEHICLE AND WENT UP TO HIS APPOINTMENT AND I WAS IN THE VEHICLE, IN THE PASSENGER SEAT, JOURNALING FOR AT LEAST TEN MINUTES OR MORE. I NEEDED TO USE THE RESTROOM SO I PUT MY STUFF IN THE BAG AT MY FEET, ON THE FLOOR BOARD ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. I REACHED OVER, GRIPPED THE KEY, TURNED IT TO THE OFF POSITION, REMOVED THE KEY FROM THE IGNITION, THE TRUCK WAS FULLY OFF. I BEGAN OPENING THE PASSENGER DOOR TO EXIT THE VEHICLE AND REALIZED THE VEHICLE WAS ROLLING BACKWARDS. I SLAMMED MY DOOR, TRIED TO USE THE SHIFTER BUT IT DID NOT MOVE. I WAS STEERING THE VEHICLE TO THE RIGHT KNOWING THERE WERE VEHICLES PARKED BEHIND ME. I THREW THE KEY IN PUT IT IN DRIVE AND HIT THE BRAKE, BUT IT WAS TO LATE AND I HAD HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE. I WAS LUCKY NOBODY WAS IN THE OTHER VEHICLE OR BEHIND MY VEHICLE. SOMEBODY COULD HAVE BEEN HURT OR KILLED. I PULLED THE TRUCK FORWARDS, I PARKED AND HANDLED WHAT HAD JUST OCCURRED. I DON?T KNOW WHAT TO DO. WE NO LONGER FEEL OUR VEHICLE IS SAFE WHEN IN PARK. I KNOW THE 2017 MODELS ARE HAVING THIS SAME PROBLEM, IF FORD STILL CANT FIX THIS PROBLEM TWO YEARS LATER, WHY WOULD I FEEL OUR VEHICLE IS SAFE OR TRUST THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE A DEFECT THAT NEEDS FIXING?????? PLEASE HELP! THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WE JUST WANT TO ENSURE OUR SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF OTHERS.
