THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS IN ATLANTA TRAFFIC. SUBARU OF AMERICA RELEASED A SERVICE BULLETIN TO REPAIR THE ISSUE AT THE DRIVER'S EXPENSE. ON 6/21/17 THEY EXTENDED THE WARRANTIES FOR THE CVT TRANSMISSION, BUT THAT DID NOT COVER THE TORQUE CONVERTER ISSUE. I FEEL I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS SINCE THIS IS A MECHANICAL FAULT ON SUBARU'S END. WHAT DOES IT TAKE FOR THEM TO REALIZE THAT THEY SHOULD BE FIXING THESE ISSUES AND ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS? A CAR TO STALL IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION AND THE DRIVER GETS HIT?",
