I PULLED INTO AN AUTO ZONE IN SALLISAW, OK. I ASKED AN EMPLOYEE TO TEST MY BATTERY AND ALTERNATOR. WHEN THE HOOD OF MY 2011 DODGE DURANGO CITADEL WAS LIFTED, IT APPEARS MY 220 AMP ALTERNATOR WAS BURNING. SMOKE WAS COMING FROM IT AND IT HAD THE SMELL OF SOMETHING BURNING. MY CAR SHUT OFF. I HAD TO BE TOWED TO A DODGE DEALERSHIP WHERE IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT MY ALTERNATOR DID BURN AND IT ALSO FRIED MY BATTERY AND THE PCM MODULE. ALL 3 REPAIRS AND LABOR COST ME $1,600, NOT INCLUDING THE TOWING OF MY VEHICLE. AFTER MUCH RESEARCH, IT APPEARS THAT I'M NOT HE ONLY CUSTOMER WHO HAS EXPERIENCED THIS. UNFORTUNATELY, THE RECALL IS ONLY ON THE 160 AMP. THIS IS SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE CHECKED. THE SERVICE GUYS STATED THAT THERE WAS A MALFUNCTION AND THAT MY CAR COULD'VE EASILY CAUGHT FIRE TRAPPING US IN.",
