I  WAS CHECKING ONLINE AND FOUND THAT THERE IS A RECALL OUT FOR MY MAKE MODEL & YEAR OF CAR FOR A FUEL PUMP CONTROL MODULE MALFUNCTION BUT DIDN'T INCLUDE MY VIN. I GOT IT TOWED TO A LOCAL AUTO SHOP AND DIAGNOSED AND THIS WAS SPECIFICALLY THE ISSUE. I HAD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET BECAUSE MY VIN# HADN'T BEEN INCLUSIVE OF THIS RECALL. I NEED TO GET MY VIN ADDED, MY CAR HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AS THE ONES COVERED, SO I CAN GET REIMBURSED.",
