THEY CANNOT FIND ANY FAULTS OR CODES RELATED TO THE ISSUE AND CLAIM EVERYTHING IS NORMAL. THE VEHICLE FEELS LIKE IT WILL STALL AT EVERY LIGHT. HOWEVER THEY DID TELL ME THEY WERE ABLE TO REPLICATE THE ISSUE ON ANOTHER VEHICLE ON THE LOT WITH SIMILAR MILEAGE, BUT THEY TELL ME THERE IS NOTHING  THEY CAN DO. SEEMS TO BE ON ALL 2017 RAV4 LE'S NOT JUST MINE.",
