TOOK TO DEALER, WHO DID A BATTERY TEST AND FOUND NO ISSUE.    THERE IS A HONDA TSB CAMPAIGN, BUT HONDA TELLS ME MY VIN IS OUT OF RANGE AND IS NOT COVERED -- EVEN THOUGH THE SYMPTOMS ARE IDENTICAL.  THEY WILL NOT OFFER SERVICE UNTIL THE VIN IS WITHIN RANGE.    REFERENCE HONDA TSB-032 \"PARASITIC BATTERY DRAW FROM VSA MODULATOR\"    HONDA AMERICA SUPPORT SUGGESTED I REPORT THIS TO NHTSA, FOR SOME REASON.  STATED THAT IF THEY RECEIVE ENOUGH COMPLAINTS FOR A VIN RANGE IT COULD BE EXPANDED.  (THIS MAKES NO SENSE TO ME SINCE I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH THEM.)",
