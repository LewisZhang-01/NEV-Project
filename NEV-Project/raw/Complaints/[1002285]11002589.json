        "summary": "MY 2008 SONATA WITH VIN [XXX] DOES NOT RECOGNIZE SMALLER ADULT PASSENGERS RESULTING IN ILLUMINATION OF THE \"PASSENGER AIR BIG OFF\" LIGHT IN THE CENTER CONSOLE.  I NOTICED THIS AROUND 2009-2010.      I DID RESEARCH THIS PROBLEM ONLINE AND NOTED THAT A RECALL WAS ISSUED (RECALL NUMBER 08V161000), WHICH AFFECTED THE VEHICLE'S \"OCCUPANT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM\" OR OCS.  AT THE TIME, THERE WAS NOT A METHOD TO RESEARCH MY SPECIFIC VIN, SO I BROUGHT THE CAR TO TAMERON HYUNDAI IN BIRMINGHAM, AL IN THE 30-50K MILE RANGE.  TAMERON HYUNDAI DID NOT PERFORM EXTENSIVE TESTING, BUT RATHER HAD A \"130 LB\" MECHANIC SIT IN THE VEHICLE AND CLAIMED THAT MY PASSENGER AIR BAG \"OCCUPANT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM\" OR OCS WAS IN WORKING ORDER.      THE CAR CONTINUED TO FAIL TO RECOGNIZING SMALLER ADULTS.  HOWEVER, MORE RECENTLY WHEN A LARGER ADULT PASSENGER SITS IN THE PASSENGER SIDE THAT CAN TRIGGER THE PASSENGER OCS, THE RED DASH AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATES ON THE DASH.      IMMEDIATELY WHEN I NOTICED THE CHANGE IN THE OPERATIONAL STATUS OF THE VEHICLE, I CALLED HYUNDAI CUSTOMER CARE REGARDING THIS ISSUE.  THEY CREATED THE CASE NUMBER 10343035 FOR REFERENCE TO MY CASE, AND REFERRED ME TO FRANK HYUNDAI.   I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO FRANK HYUNDAI WHERE THE PROBLEM AS A MALFUNCTIONING PASSENGER OCS WHICH WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE RECALL ABOVE.    BOTH FRANK HYUNDAI AND HYUNDAI CUSTOMER CARE ADVISED ME THAT MY VEHICLE'S VIN NUMBER WAS NOT SUBJECT TO THE RECALL ON THE OCS (RECALL NUMBER 08V161000).  THE COST OF REPAIR WAS GREATER THAN THE VEHICLE'S VALUE.      I WAS EASILY ABLE TO AFFORD A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE, SO I DISPOSED OF THE VEHICLE AND OBTAINED A NEW VEHICLE.  HOWEVER, I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF OTHERS WHO STILL DRIVE SIMILAR VEHICLES.      I THINK SOME SONATAS MAY HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED IN RECALL 08V161000, AND I THINK THE CAMPAIGN SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO OTHER VINS.
