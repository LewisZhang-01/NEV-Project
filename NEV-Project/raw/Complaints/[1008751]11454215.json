        "summary": "Original owner, purchased new, current mileage 35,700. The rear subframes and suspension links are severely rusted and deteriorating rapidly, making this car unsafe to drive unless most (or all) the components are replaced and the metal subframes rust treated. This is a well known problem among owners and the Mazda 6 has been recalled for rusted front subframes but not for the rear. The car spent 4 of its 13 years in upstate New York and the remainder in Alexandria VA and has shared parking space, car washes and normal maintenance with the family's 2000 BMW Z3, which has been driven 115,000 miles and shows no subframe/suspension rust damage. Mazda should be made to recall this and its other vehicles with this problem and either make the repairs or offer a substantial settlement for the inevitable scrappage of the car. I'm pursuing a class action lawsuit.",
