        "summary": "\"2017 SUPERDUTY DEATH WOBBLE\"   THURSDAY, JUNE 7TH 2018  WHILE DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEED (55 MPH) AND GOING OVER VERY MILD BUMPS IN THE HIGHWAY, THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD SHAKE VIOLENTLY AND UNCONTROLLABLY WHILE THE WHOLE VEHICLE SHUTTERED ENOUGH TO OPEN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT AND EMPTY ITS CONTENTS ALONG WITH EVERYTHING IN THE CENTER CONSOLE.  I HAD NO CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE TO KEEP IT IN MY LANE AND I LEFT THE ROAD FOR THE DITCH. WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES, THE ANTILOCK WAS ACTIVATED AND DID EVENTUALLY COME TO A STOP. TWO WITNESSES STOPPED TO MAKE SURE I WAS OK AND SAID IT APPEARED AS THOUGH THE FRONT END WAS COMING OFF THE VEHICLE.  THE VEHICLE WAS DRIVEN TO THE NEXT EXIT (ABOUT 5 MILES) AND THIS ISSUE REPEATED THREE MORE TIMES AT SLOWER SPEEDS.  THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED 80 MILES AND A REPAIR WAS PERFORMED TO THE STABILIZER SHOCK THAT TOOK A FULL WEEK. IT IS NOW 7/29/2018 AND THE VEHICLE IS SHOWING SIGNS OF THE SHAKE AGAIN BUT MILD IN NATURE.  I HAVE HAD THIS SAME ISSUE ON OLDER VEHICLES BUT NEVER ON A NEW VEHICLE WITH UNDER 30,000 MILES ON IT.   THIS ISSUE WILL KILL SOMEONE SOMEDAY.",
