I'M A LIFETIME CLUTCH DRIVER (NEARLY 20 YEARS), AND EVERY VEHICLE GOT IN EXCESS OF 150,000 MILES BEFORE NEEDING A NEW CLUTCH. THE SECOND GENERATION XTERRA MANUAL TRANSMISSION CLUTCH IS UTTERLY JUNK. DON'T EVER BUY THIS VEHICLE IN MANUAL, OR ANY NISSAN. AFTER OWNING 3 XTERRAS IN MY TIME I WILL NEVER OWN ANOTHER NISSAN AGAIN. THIS PREMATURE FAIL IS A MANUFACTURING/OEM DEFECT. PLEASE RECALL!!!",
