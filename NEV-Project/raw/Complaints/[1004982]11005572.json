THE BRAKES FAILED ONCE WHEN A CAR PULLED OUT IN FRONT OF ME AND I HAD TO SLAM ON THE BRAKES, THE SECOND TIME WAS DRIVING NORMALLY AND THE THIRD TODAY AFTER THE FRONT TIRES LOST TRACTION IN WET GRASS. THIS MAKES IT TO WERE YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE PEDDLE ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND HOPE THE CAR COMES TO A STOP.THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON EVERY TIME YOU ACCELERATE TO HARD (LIKE ENTERING AN INTERSTATE) THEN WILL GO AWAY AFTER A FEW DAYS. THE CODE THAT POPS UP FOR IT IS TURBO/SUPER CHARGER UNDER BOOST. THIS MAKES THE CAR REALLY SLUGGISH AND HARD TO GET UP TO SPEED.",
