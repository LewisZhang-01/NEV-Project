THE BULBS WERE TESTED BY OUR MECHANIC AND HE STATED THAT THE GMC YUKON OF THIS YEAR ARE KNOWN TO HAVE MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKE LIGHT HOUSING UNITS ON THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE.  THE ELECTRICAL BOARD ASSOCIATED WITH IT HAS ISSUES THE MECHANIC STATED.  I REVIEWED MANY POST ONLINE AND WONDER WHY THIS ISN'T A REQUIRED RECALL.   TO ME THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN AND WE BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE TO TRANSPORT MY KIDS AND WIFE.  I'D LIKE THIS TO BE CONSIDERED A RECALL IMMEDIATELY.",
