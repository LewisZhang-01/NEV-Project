WHEN I INSPECTED THE VEHICLE I FOUND THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR ANTI-SWAY BAR BUSHING BRACKET, MOUNTING BOLTS, AND NUTS WERE ALL MISSING, EFFECTIVELY DISCONNECTING THE REAR ANTI-SWAY BAR AND CAUSING DANGEROUS BODY ROLL.  IN TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW THIS OCCURRED I FOUND A THREAD ON THE WWW.IRV2.COM FORUM INDICATING THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH ALL YEAR MODELS OF THE FORD F53 MOTORHOME CHASSIS.",
