MULTIPLE OTHER PROFESSIONAL OPINIONS HAVE STATED THAT THE LATCH IS UNNECESSARY AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE DOOR AJAR LIGHT REMAINING ON AFTER CLEANING VARIOUS PARTS, REPLACING PARTS, AND SPENDING LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY ON PATCH FIXES.  THE LIGHT CAME ON INTERMITTENTLY APPROXIMATELY ONE MONTH AGO AND GRADUALLY STAYED ON AS TIME PROGRESSED.  ORIGINALLY, I COULD CLOSE THE OPEN AND CLOSE THE DOOR UP TO 3 TIMES AND THE DOOR AJAR LIGHT WOULD TURN OFF. OVER TIME THE LIGHT WOULD CONTINUALLY STAY ON. THIS BEGAN TO DRAIN THE VEHICLE BATTERY AS WELL.",
