FORD HAS REPLACED MY STEERING STABILIZER ONCE (19,000M) AND HAVE BEEN WAITING ON THE SECOND ONE (29,000M) FOR 4.5 WEEKS.  TO GET IT TO STOP THE FIRST TIME, I HAD TO SLOW TO 50MPH ON A BUSY INTERSTATE WHILE THE LAST TWO TIMES, IT HAS REQUIRED ME TO SLOW DOWN TO UNDER 30 REGARDLESS OF THE INITIAL SPEED (I HAD TO PULL OFF ON THE SHOULDER).  IT IS NOW BAD ENOUGH I'M SCARED TO DRIVE IT ON THE HIGHWAY.  A LOCAL STEERING SHOP WILL EVALUATE THE F250 THIS NEXT WEEK - THEY, APPARENTLY, HAVE HAD GOOD SUCCESS WHEN REPLACING THE STABILIZER WITH AN AFTER-MARKET DOUBLE STABILIZER KIT ALONG WITH NEW FRONT SHOCKS.  IT IS ALSO MY NEW UNDERSTANDING THAT IT COULD ALSO INCLUDE OTHER STEERING COMPONENTS INCLUDING THE TRACK BAR, AND TIE-RODS ..... WE'LL SEE.  THE DATE OF THE EVENT IS THE FIRST TIME I EXPERIENCED IT - IT IS NOW THE END OF JANUARY OF 2020 AND IT IS STILL ONGOING.",
