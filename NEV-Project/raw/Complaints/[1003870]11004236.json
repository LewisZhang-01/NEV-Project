        "summary": "THE LEFT LOWER CONTROL ARM ON THE FRONT SUSPENSION FAILED AT APPROXIMATELY 45 MPH ON A 5 LANE CITY ROAD CAUSING THE WHEEL TO FOLD UNDER THE VEHICLE.  THE CAR MADE AN IMMEDIATE LEFT TURN INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE WAS LOST.  FORTUNATELY THE CAR CAME TO A STOP WITHOUT HITTING ANYTHING AND NO ONE WAS INJURED BUT THE POTENTIAL FOR A SERIOUS ACCIDENT WAS CERTAINLY THERE.  THE CONTROL ARM FAILED DUE TO CORROSION AND UPON INSPECTION, IT WAS FOUND THAT THE RIGHT FRONT LOWER CONTROL ARM IS ALSO RUSTED THROUGH AND CRACKED AND NEARING FAILURE AS WELL.  PICTURES ARE ATTACHED.    THE CAR HAS APPROXIMATELY 105,000 MILES ON IT AND WE ARE THE SECOND OWNER.  IT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY WELL MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT ITS LIFE.  IN MY 50 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WORKING ON AUTOMOBILES I'VE NEVER SEEN A CONTROL ARM FAILURE LIKE THIS.",
