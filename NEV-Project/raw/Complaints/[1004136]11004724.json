THE MECHANIC ALSO ASKED ME TO CHECK FOR A RECALL BEFORE FIXING DUE TO THIS BEING A COMMON PROBLEM WITH SOME VOLVOS. I AM ALSO NOTICING THERE IS A POWERSTEERING LEAKAGE SOMEWHERE BECAUSE IM CONSTANTLY PUTTING IN POWERSTEERING. PLEASE TAKE MY COMPLAINT IN CONSIDERATION DUE TO IT BEING LIFE THREATING AND I HAVE CHILDREN WHO I HAVE TO CARRY AROUND IN THAT VEHICLE. IF ITS A DEFECTIVE EQUITMENT ON VOLVO IM ASKING FOR IMMEDIATE REPLACEMENT. FOR SAFETY",
