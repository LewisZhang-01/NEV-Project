WHEN THERE IS AN ISSUE THE CAR \"SHUDDERS\", LOSES SPEED, HAS TROUBLE MERGING INTO TRAFFIC OR TAKING TURNS. AGAIN MY CAR FELT THE SAME WAY. APPARENTLY THIS TIME THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE TMC, BUT THE CLUTCH NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AGAIN, JUST ABOUT 18 MONTHS LATER. TO HAVE MY CLUTCH REPLACED TWICE WITHIN THREE YEARS SEEMS ABSURD. EVEN THE DEALERSHIP NOTES THAT THE CLUTCH PACKAGE PUT IN MY CAR THE FIRST TIME HAD KNOWN ISSUES AND WEREN'T THAT GREAT. THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN FOR MYSELF AND OTHERS ON THE ROAD. I'D HOPE FORD OR SOMEONE LOOKS FURTHER INTO THIS. THERE SEEMS TO BE A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT IN THE WORKS, BUT I AT LEAST WANTED TO VOICE MY SAFETY CONCERNS. KINDEST REGARDS",
