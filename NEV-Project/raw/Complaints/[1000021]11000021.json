THIS HAS ALSO CAUSED THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TO COME ON AND OFF WHENEVER IT WANTS TO. I WOULD TRAVEL TO GET IT CHECK ONLY FOR THE LIGHT TO BE OFF. I AM UNABLE TO SAFELY DRIVE WITH OUT FILLING UP MY TANK EVERY COUPLE OF DAY TO ENSURE THAT I ACTUALLY HAVE GAS. IT IS CAUSING THE CAR TO BE SLOW IN STARTING AFTER A LIGHT OR WHEN TRYING TO MERGE WITH TRAFFIC, HITTING THE GAS DOES NOT REALLY DO MUCH. IT'S A DANGER ON THE ROAD. IN DOING A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH WHILE TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT THE ISSUE MIGHT BE - IT SEEMS THIS IS A WIDE SPREAD AND KNOWN HYUNDAI PROBLEM THAT HASN'T BEEN ADDRESSED BECUASE THERE HAS NOT BEEN A LOSS OF LIFE. IT SHOULDN'T HAVE OT GET THAT FAR TO PREVENT WHAT IS AN OBVIOUS AND WIDESPREAD ISSUE.",
