        "summary": "WAS DRIVING ON INTERSTATE 287 W WHEN THE CAR SHUT DOWN. THERE WAS NO WARNING LIGHT. I HAD TO QUICKLY TRY TO GET THE CAR TO THE SHOULDER. THERE WAS A BURNING SMELL WHEN THE CAR SHUT DOWN.   THE ELANTRA WAS BOUGHT NEW AND I ONLY OWNED IT FOR 5 MONTHS.   I CALLED AAA AND THEY TOWED US TO THEIR GAS STATION IN NY. FROM THERE, ANOTHER TOW TRUCK TOOK US TO THE MAZDA REPAIR LOCATION, IN NJ,  WHICH DOES REPAIRS FOR THE HYUNDAI DEALER.   THEY PUT OIL IN THE CAR AND THEN REALIZED THAT THERE WAS NO OIL IN THE CAR. THEY STATED WE NEEDED A NEW ENGINE AND IT WOULD TAKE ONE MONTH TO ORDER AND INSTALL.   ONLY TWO WEEKS EARLIER, WE WENT TO THAT SAME REPAIR LOCATION FOR A 5,000 MILE CHECK UP WHERE THEY DID AN OIL CHANGE. NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE CAR.  I AM 88 AND VERY LUCKY I KNEW WHAT TO DO WHEN THE CAR SHUT DOWN. I HOPE THIS DOES NOT HAPPENED TO A NEW DRIVER.",
