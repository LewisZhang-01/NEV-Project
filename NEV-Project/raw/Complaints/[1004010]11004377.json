        "summary": "OVER THE LAST YEAR, OUR HYUNDAI SANTA FE HAS DEVELOPED A VERY TROUBLING STALLING PROBLEM THAT HAS ONLY INCREASED IN FREQUENCY. THE VEHICLE LOSES POWER WHILE DRIVING REGARDLESS OF SPEED, OFTEN SEVERAL TIMES IN THE SAME TRIP REGARDLESS OF DISTANCE TRAVELED. IT STALLS ON LOCAL, LOW-SPEED ROADS AS WELL AS FREEWAY DRIVING. WHEN IT STALLS, ALL STEERING IS LOST. THIS IS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS.    A SIMPLE GOOGLE SEARCH INDICATES THAT THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE AMONG HYUNDAI  CUSTOMERS AND DEALERSHIPS AND YET I AM NOT ABLE TO LOCATE ANY INFORMATION  ABOUT A RECALL TO CORRECT THIS ISSUE. THIS IS A POTENTIALLY FATAL PROBLEM THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY HYUNDAI. I DID CONTACT THEM.    TODAY, I RECEIVED A RESPONSE INDICATING THAT HYUNDAI HAS NO EXPLANATION FOR THE ISSUE AND WILL OFFER NO ASSISTANCE TO REPAIR IT. THEIR ONLY SUGGESTION WAS THAT I CONTACT A LOCAL DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR.    AS I INDICATED, THIS IS A PROBLEM KNOWN TO HYUNDAI, SOME OF THEIR CUSTOMERS AND DEALERSHIPS. SINCE NHTSA IS THE AGENCY OVERSEEING ISSUES OF THIS TYPE, I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS STALLING ISSUE BEFORE SOMETHING TRAGIC HAPPENS.",
