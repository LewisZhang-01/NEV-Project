If pushed above the 2000 RPM, the car would continue to violently jerk. At this time, all the dash warning lights came on, but no warnings or driving issues prior to the incident. From the manufacturer (dealer inspected), error code P0369-CMP Sensor and this issue applies to a service article A180101 from January 2018 which notes that the camshaft thrust cover roughness out of spec and damaged camshaft position sensor. Concerns for this is that without warning the vehicle stalls out regardless of speed for a vehicle after owning for only 4 years.",
