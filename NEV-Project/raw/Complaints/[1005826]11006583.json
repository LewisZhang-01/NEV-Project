NOW, AT 80,000 MILES OIL IS AT BOTTOM TIP OF OIL DIP STICK.  I CALLED DEALER WHERE OIL CONSUMPTION TEST WAS DONE.  WAS TOLD \"WE ONLY ADDED A QUART...\" AT TEST'S CONCLUSION.  I WAS NOT TOLD AT THE TIME OF THE OIL CONSUMPTION TEST'S CONCLUSION THAT A \"QUART WAS ADDED.\"  SINCE I WAS NOT TOLD A QUART WAS ADDED, I WASN'T AWARE I HAD TO WATCH MY OIL.    UPON STARTING THE VEHICLE, OIL LIGHT FLASHED BRIEFLY BUT I COULDN'T MAKE-OUT WHAT IT WAS.  FOLLOWING DAY, UPON STARTING VEHICLE, IT FLASHED AGAIN.  ANOTHER DAY AND IT STAYS ON VERY BRIEFLY BUT LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO FIGURE THAT IT WAS THE OIL LIGHT.  I LET CAR SIT ON FLAT SURFACE FOR AN HOUR, CHECKED OIL AND IT JUST TOUCHED TIP OF DIPSTICK.  I ADDED TWO QUARTS OF OIL.",
