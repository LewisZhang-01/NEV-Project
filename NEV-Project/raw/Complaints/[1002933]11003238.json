THE SCARIEST PROBLEM WAS WHEN I PULLED OUT INTO TRAFFIC, GOT UP TO ABOUT 35 MPH AND THE CAR WENT INTO \"LOCKDOWN\". CAR PUT ITSELF INTO NEUTRAL, AIR BAGS TURNED OFF, BRAKES DIDN'T WORK, AND JUST ABOUT EVERY OTHER SYSTEM TURNED OFF. THIS HAS HAPPENED 3 TIMES AND THE 1ST 3 TIMES, THEY KEPT SAYING IT WAS A SOFTWARE UPDATE. TURNED OUT THE ENGINE THERMOSTAT WAS READING IT WAS -40 DEGREES AND THIS CAUSED IT. NOW I HAVE A SERVICE TIRE PRESSURE SYSTEM WARNING, AFTER HAVING TO REPLACE ALL 4 TIRES AFTER ONLY 28K MILES. THIS IS AN UNSAFE VEHICLE AND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO WORK ON LEMON LAW IN FLORIDA, BUT NOW MY JEEP REP IS GONE AND LOOKS LIKE I HAVE TO START THE PROCESS OVER. WHY DOESN'T JEEP JUST RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A SEVERE SAFETY ISSUE AND I WON'T LET MY WIFE OR SON DRIVE THIS VEHICLE, BUT I NEED IT TO GET TO WORK, RISKING MY LIFE EVERY TIME I DRIVE IT.",
