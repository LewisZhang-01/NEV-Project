MY VEHICLE HAS A LITTLE OVER 60,000.00 MILES AND IS OUT OF WARRANTY AND NOT COVERED AND I CONTACTED CHRYSLER AND THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS.  THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF THIS FAULTY ENGINE AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL OR CHRYSLER NEEDS TO PAY FOR MY REPAIRS.  I HAVE A 3.47 LITER ENGINE WITH ONLY 60,000.00 MILES AND IT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED ON THE LEFT SIDE.  CHRYSLER HAD THIS SAME ISSUE WITH THE 3.6 LITER ENGINE AND EXTENDED THE WARRANTY AND THE SAME OR RECALL SHOULD BE DONE WITH THE 3.7 LITER ENGINE.",
