I CHALKED UP THE THE DRIVERS SIDE FAILURE TO HAPPENSTANCE, BUT AFTER PASSENGER SIDE RECENTLY HAD THE SAME FAILURE I DID SOME INVESTIGATING AND REALIZED THIS IS A VEHICLE ASSEMBLY ISSUE. THE SAME ISSUE HAD RECALLS FOR THE LATER MODELS 2001-05 TACOMAS, I BELIEVE. NOT SURE WHY THE EARLIER MODELS WERE EXCLUDED, BUT THIS IS SCARY AND DANGEROUS TO HAVE A COMPLETE BREAKDOWN WHILE IN TRAFFIC. THE TOWS AND REPAIRS COST OVER $500 IN TOTAL FOR BOTH INSTANCES. I'M NOT LOOKING FOR REIMBURSEMENT AS MUCH AS REASSURANCE THAT MY TRUCK IS SAFE TO DRIVE. BOTH INSTANCES OCCURRED ON CITY STREETS. PASSENGER SIDE WAS UNDER 10 MPH TURNING RIGHT TOWARDS MY DRIVEWAY. THE RECENT INCIDENT WAS TURNING LEFT AT APPROXIMATELY 25 MPH THROUGH AN INTERSECTION WITH A TRAFFIC LIGHT. THE TRUCK TIRE CRUMBLED ON THE PASSENGER SIDE AND SLIDE ABOUT 30 FEET TO A STOP ALONG THE CURB.",
