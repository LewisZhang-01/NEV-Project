        "summary": "THERE ARE EXHAUST FUMES COMING INTO THE CABIN OF THIS 2016 FORD EXPLORER.  THE SMELL STINKS AND THE GASES HAVE MADE THE OCCUPANTS OF THE EXPLORER SICK.  THE DEALERSHIP HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THE SMELL.  IT HAS HAD AT LEAST NINE OPPORTUNITIES TO FIX THE PROBLEM, BUT IT HAS BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL.  FORD IS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM. THE EXHAUST FUMES COME INTO THE CABIN AT VARIOUS TIMES.  THE PROBLEM USUALLY OCCURS WHEN THE REAR A/C RE-CIRCULATION IS ON AND WHEN THERE IS HEAVY ACCELERATION OR GOING UPHILL. THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY ALTERATIONS TO THE EXPLORER EXCEPT FOR THE REPAIRS ATTEMPTED BY THE DEALERSHIP.  IN MAY 2017, THE DEALERSHIP USED TSB 17-0044 TO TRY TO STOP THE FUMES FROM COMING INTO THE CABIN.  AGAIN, IT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.  IT APPEARS THE FORD TOLD THE DEALERSHIP TO ALSO TRY TSB 14-0130.  THAT REPAIR DID NOT WORK EITHER.",
