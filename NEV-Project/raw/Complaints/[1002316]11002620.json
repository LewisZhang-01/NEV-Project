THIS IS A 3 ROW PASSENGER VEHICLE WITH NO VENTS IN THE 3RD ROW.  THE CAR IS MISSING AT LEAST 4 VENTS AND IS CREATING A SAFETY HAZARD IN HOT AND COLD ENVIRONMENTS.  I CANNOT HAVE PASSENGERS OR ANIMALS IN THE REAR OF THE CAR DUE TO THE LACK OF VENTILATION IN THE VEHICLE.  IN ADDITION, DUE TO ATTEMPTING TO COOL THE CAR DOWN, RUNNING THE CAR WITH MAX AC IS GIVING ME ONLY 9-10 MPG.  CAR IS ADVERTISED AS 16 MPG CITY.  THIS IS A BLATANT DESIGN AND SAFETY ISSUE FOR CLIMATE CONTROL AND FALSE MPG STANDARDS.",
