THE PARTS THAT ARE CRACKED ARE RIGHT ABOVE THE INSTRUMENT PANEL. THE CRACKS HAVE GROWN THE WIDTH OF THE COVER. THESE CRACKS OCCUR FREQUENTLY IN MOTION OR NOT IN MOTION. I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS THE HEAT AND BUMPS BUT IT SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM. MY CONCERN IS IF THE AIRBAGS GO OFF THOSE PIECES OF THE DASH COULD FLY AND BREAK OFF LIKE NOTHING AND HURT SOMEONE EVEN WORSE IN THAT TYPE OF SITUATION.  THE PHOTO PROVIDED IS JUST TWO OF THE FOUR LOCATED ON THE DASH.",
