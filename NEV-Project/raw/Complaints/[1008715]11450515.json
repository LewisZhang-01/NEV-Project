        "summary": "I own 2016 Ram 1500 Crew Cab 4x4 SLT Big Horn. I purchased the truck in June 2019 at our local Dodge Dealership in Vinita, Oklahoma with 59k on it. Truck ran fine, did have the Hemi Tick startin until December 20,2021 and the CEL came on. Personally had my husband, CAT Certified Diesel Mechanic run the codes. To witch P062A Circuit \"A\" Fuel Pump Range/Performance Code was given.   Truck was parked and dealership, Vance Dodge Miami, OK was called. Truck taken on December 28,2021. Told the tech before hand while our daughters Nitro was getting fixed when he got my truck to go through it and make sure no other issues. Once truck was there few days later they called telling me that I had 4 broken Exhaust Manifold Bolts, needed another new battery, and CEL was on due to Fuel Pressure Switch failure. Picked truck up Jan 6, 2022. Did not even get out of city limits when CEL back on. Drove it 15 miles home. Changed the battery with brand new one. CEL back on, called dealership, requested Manager. Told to bring back in the following Monday. Truck back @ dealership Jan 10, 2022 just picked back up Feb 2,2022 to witch CEL IS STILL ON. after a month they fixed a 200 dollar connector behind the driver wheel and it still has not fixed the frickin issue. Now it's still throwing P062A code. Dealership acted as if they was beyond annoyed by me & my truck. Will yet again call them Monday. And now my exhaust is rattling that they just had off. I have paid out of pocket for all these repairs and they are getting beyond expensive and I'm not the only one with these issues. My truck has had all work done when suggested if not before. As well as the original owner who I know. My truck is not abused or neglected. I don't put cheap parts on it either, had I had been able to find ARP Manifold Bolts it would have gotten them ..  This is getting beyond ridiculous.. Something needs to be done I spent way too much money for my truck to have all these issues. BTW, my truck is paid for I owe $0.00",
