I DROVE IT WORK AND HOPING THE AIRBAG LIGHTS WILL TURN OFF AND IT DID NOT. I TOOK THE PROBLEM TO THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP FOR EVALUATION. A LITTLE HISTORY, MY AIRBAG LIGHTS CAME ON BACK IN 2012, CASE #10352554, THE VEHICLE HAD A RECALL FOR IT. THE DEALERSHIP SENT THE FRONT RIGHT PASSENGER SEAT TO CALIFORNIA FOR REPAIRS. THE PROBLEM WAS FIXED. NOW JUMP FORWARD 2017, MY AIRBAGS LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN AND THE DEALERSHIP ADVISED ME THE PROBLEM IS NOT RELATED TO THE RECALL BACK IN 2012. THE DEALERSHIP ADVISED ME THE PROBLEM NOW HAD TO DO WITH THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT PRESSURE SENSOR (CUSHION) FOR THE AIRBAGS. ACCORDING TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE WHOLE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT TO FIX THE PROBLEM IN ORDER FOR MY FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AIRBAG TO DEPLOY PROPERLY DURING AN ACCIDENT. I FEEL THAT THIS IS A DEFECT WITH THIS HYUNDAI VEHICLE AND A SECONDARY PROBLEM RELATED TO THE AIRBAG RECALL. I FEEL THE PROBLEM SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER TO PREVENT ANY INJURY OR DEATH.",
