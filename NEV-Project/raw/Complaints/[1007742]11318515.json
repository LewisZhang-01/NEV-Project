I HAVE CALLED LEXUS CORPORATE MULTIPLE TIMES AND THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING. I WOULD HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET OR BUY A COVER WHICH QUITE FRANKLY IT LOOKS UGLY ON A LUXURY SEDAN. WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR I THOUGHT IT WAS A COSMETIC ISSUE, BUT IT HAS GOTTEN WORSE ESPECIALLY ON HOT WEATHER LIKE THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA. IT IS REALLY CONCERNING AS I ALMOST HIT A PEDESTRIAN WHEN THE SUN WAS GLARING OVER MY FRONT WINDSHIELD. I AM ACTUALLY TERRIFIED OF LEAVING MY HOME ON SUNNY DAYS AS I MIGHT GET IN AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF THE GLARE. FEW YEARS AGO, LEXUS OFFERED TO REPLACE UNDER WARRANTY, BUT IT WASN'T A RECALL AND THE OWNER DIDN'T HAVE IT FIXED. BACK THEN THE CAR HAD AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FROM THE DEALER (ESKRIDGE LEXUS OKC). THE GRACE PERIOD FOR THE REPLACEMENT IS OVER.THE CAR HAS BEEN WELL TAKEN CARE OF AND GOOD SERVICE RECORD. I HAVE NO PROOF OF WHAT I'M GOING TO SAY NEXT, BUT I FEAR THAT SINCE THE DASHBOARD IS STICKY AND CRACKED AND PEELING OFF, THE AIRBAGS MIGHT NOT PROPERLY DEPLOY IN CASE OF AN ACCIDENT.",
