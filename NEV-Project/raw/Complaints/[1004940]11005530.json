CONCERNING THE AIR BAG RECALL DATED 07/2016 INFORMING ME OF SAID RECALL AND STATING THAT I WOULD BE NOTIFIED WHEN PARTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR REPAIRS. THAT HAS BEEN OVER A YEAR AGO AND NOW I HAVE A CRACK IN THE CORNER OF THE DASH PANEL WHERE THE AIR-BAG IS LOCATED. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH IT APPEARS THAT GM. HAS ISSUES WITH GM TRUCKS, SUV'S ETC. FROM YEAR 2007 UNTIL AT LEAST 2013 CONCERNING THIS ISSUE. I HAVE CONTACTED GM. DEALERS AND GM THEIR SELF CONCERNING REPAIRS AND OR REPLACEMENT OF THE AIRBAGS AND STATED MY CONCERNS WITH THE DASH BEING CRACKED IN THIS LOCATION. THESE AIRBAGS HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED TO KILL OR INJURE PEOPLE AND AS A CONCERNED OWNER OF ONE OF THESE VEHICLES I FEEL GM. IS NOT MOVING FAST ENOUGH TO RECTIFY THIS SITUATION. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF THESE VEHICLES AFFECTED BY THIS RECALL ON THE ROAD EVERY DAY AND THAT LEADS TO GREATER RISK OF DEATH OR INJURY. I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GET RID OF MY VEHICLE BECAUSE OF SAFETY CONCERNS BY THE MANUFACTURER. THANKS IN ADVANCE FOR ANY ASSISTANCE IN THIS MATTER.",
