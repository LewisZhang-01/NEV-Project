        "summary": "The brakes failed due to corrosion of the brake line from the master cyl. to the LH front brake flex hose.  The brake fluid simply came out of the line.  There was insifficient fluid pressure to do any wheel braking.   Luckily, I had just moved off from a stop and was applying the brakes to slow down on a bend. The corrosion occured under a plastic clip that is there to keep adjacent brake lines from vibrating against each other.  The corrosion occured in an area that is not inspectable unless the front wheel and wheel arch cover is first removed.",
