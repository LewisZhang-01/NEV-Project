I TOOK IT TO A SHOP TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT AND HAD THEM FLUSH THE POWER STEERING FLUID AND PUT IN NEW FLUID AS WELL AS CHECK FOR ANY POSSIBLE LEAKS - NONE WERE FOUND. THIS REOCCURRED AFTER ABOUT TWO WEEKS BUT THIS TIME THE STIFFNESS WAS MUCH WORSE WHERE I FELT UNSURE THAT I COULD TURN THE STEERING AT ALL. AFTER INVESTIGATING ON LINE I FOUND MANY OTHERS HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES. THIS SCARY EXPERIENCE HAPPENED ON 2-21-18 SO I MADE AN EMERGENCY CALL TO MY MECHANIC TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT ASAP FOR 2-23-18. LOOKS LIKE THE STEERING INTERMEDIATE SHAFT (U JOINT) IS GOING ON ALL THESE TRUCKS. I'M AT APPROXIMATELY 143K MILES.I'M SO GLAD THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN WHILE I WAS IN HEAVY TRAFFIC ALTHOUGH I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY GOING HOME WHEN IT HAPPENED.",
