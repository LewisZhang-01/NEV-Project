LAST INSTANCE WAS ON A STRAIGHT, FLAT RURAL ROAD WITH NO LIGHTS, SIGNALS OR SAME DIRECTION TRAFFIC TRAVELLING AT 55MPH.     WAS APPROACHED BY ONCOMING CAR WHICH FAILED TO DIM LIGHTS. MINE DIMMED BUT DID NOT RETURN TO BRIGHT. HAD TO POWER CYCLE THE LIGHTS TO GET THE HIGH BEAMS BACK.  A MINUTE LATER WAS APPROACHED BY 3 CARS CLOSE TOGETHER WITH OVERLY BRIGHT LIGHTS. MINE DIMMED AND STAYED DIM JUST LIKE BEFORE. HAD TO POWER CYCLE TO GET THE BRIGHTS BACK.    THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY DEFECT TO NOT HAVE BRIGHTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER BEING BLINDED BY ONCOMING TRAFFIC!",
