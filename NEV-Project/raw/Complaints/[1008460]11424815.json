        "summary": "While driving posted speed limit  ( 75mph ) on highway in Texas. Vehicle went into a almost uncontrollable bouncing /  shaking cause Vehicle to bounce / shake violently across the center line.  I immediately reduced speed by letting off accelerate.  Grasped firmly ahold of the steering wheel & basically  \" hanging on \" till Vehicle stopped bouncing  / shaking violent @ about 50mph. Fortunately no Vehicles were in the other lane however the vehicles behind me were affected. Going from posted speed limit to 25mph below as soon as I could.....obviously caused them so to respond. This  \" Death Wobble  \"  as I found out created a very dangerous situation. For not only me but others as well. I experienced this 4 more times on this highway in Texas and twice on a highway in Illinois.  Both had similar road conditions ( slightly wash boarded ) but Vehicle responded all times in the same violent shaking and bouncing to a point of almost losing control of the vehicle.  Upon returning to Arizona  - I reported issue at Horne Ford / they scheduled a appointment to look at the vehicle. This is scheduled for  7/20/2021@ 0900.",
