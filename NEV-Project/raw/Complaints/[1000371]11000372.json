ALSO GOT A RECALL LETTER IN JANUARY 2017 STATING \"NO REMEDY YET AND WAIT FOR NEXT LETTER\". JUNE 13TH THEY FLEW OPEN AGAIN AND UNABLE TO CLOSE. ULTIMATELY BUNGEED DOORS CLOSED TO GET HOME 30 MILES. THEN HAD TOWED (MY EXPENSE - TOYOTA WOULDNT COVER) TO LEBRUN AGAIN. THEY NOW SAY ITS NOT COVERED UNDER RECALL AND ITS BECAUSE THE LATCHES ARE FAULTY AND NEED REPLACING. OVER $2100. CALLED TOYOTA AND WAS \"SORRY FOR THE EXPERIENCE I WAS HAVING - LATCHES ARE NOT ON RECALL - ONLY THE CABLES AND MY PROBLEM IS WITH FAULTY LATCHES\". VEHICLE DOORS DONT OPEN SPONTANEOUSLY UNLESS IN MOTION....WHEN STILL - THEY STAY CLOSED. I USE THIS FOR WORK AND WAS SUPPOSED TO START AS AN UBER DRIVER JUNE 29TH - I AM AND WILL LOSE LOTS OF MONEY AND AM VERY DEPRESSED ABOUT MY CHOICE OF BUYING MY FIRST NEW VEHICLE.",
