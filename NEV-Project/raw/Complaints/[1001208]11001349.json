LAST WEEK MY CAR SHUT OFF FOR NO APPARENT REASON WHILE DRIVING 55MPH WHICH IS THE EXACT PROBLEM CAUSING THE ORIGINAL RECALL. THE INSTRUMENT PANEL LIGHTS ALL CAME  ON FOR SEVERAL SECONDS BUT THE ENGINE QUIT RUNNING.  THEN, AFTER SEVERAL SECONDS IT RETURNED TO NORMAL.  THE CAR WILL ALSO NOT START ON OCCASION WHEN TURNING THE KEY UNLESS I PUSH THE KEY SIDEWAYS WHILE TURNING IT.  I THINK SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE IGNITION MODULE.     IT IS POSSIBLE THE PROBLEM WITH THE NEW IGNITION MODULE IS THE SAME AS THE OLD ONE?  OR IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE RECALL WAS NOT EVER PERFORMED IN SPITE OF WHAT MY DEALER SAYS?  THE DEALER REFUSES TO REPAIR THIS PROBLEM FOR FREE BECAUSE, ACCORDING TO THEIR RECORDS, THE RECALL OF THE IGNITION MODULE HAS BEEN DONE.    WHAT SHOULD I DO?",
