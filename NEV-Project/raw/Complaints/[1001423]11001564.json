THE MECHANIC EXPLAINED THAT IT WAS NOT MERELY DEFECTIVE, BUT WAS A DESIGN DEFECT, FOR WHICH THERE HAD BEEN RECALLS FOR OTHER/LATER MODELS YEARS. I CONFIRMED THIS WITH A GOOGLE SEARCH. I WAS TOLD THAT, WERE THE PART NOT REPLACED, THE DAMAGE COULD BE CATASTROPHIC. COST - OVER $600. I COMPLAINED TO HONDA OF AMERICA, AND SOUGHT REIMBURSEMENT. THEY DENIED IT, SAYING IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY. CAR HAS ABOUT 88,000 MILES AND WARRANTY WAS FOR 5 YEARS AND 30,000 MILES. HOWEVER, HONDA OF AMERICA REPRESENTATIVE SAID HE WOULD SUE HONDA IF IT WERE HIM. I SHOULD RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT, AND THERE SHOULD BE RECALL ON THIS PART.",
