BEFORE THE VEHICLE COULD BE BROUGHT TO A STOP IT LOST ALL POWER AND CONTROL INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO STEER THE VEHICLE. THE PROBLEM WAS DIAGNOSED AS A SHORT IN THE ALTERNATOR THAT ALSO DEFECTED THE BATTERY. I WAS TOLD BY THE CHRYSLER CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT MY VEHICLE WAS NOT INCLUDED IN A RECALL THAT IDENTIFIES THESE SAME SYMPTOMS, AND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE I COULD DO GOING FORWARD WHEN I REQUESTED TO SPEAK WITH A CASE MANAGER INVESTIGATING THESE CASES.",
