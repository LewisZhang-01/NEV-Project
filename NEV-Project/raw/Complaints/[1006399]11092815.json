REQUIRES CONSTANT STEERING WHEEL INPUT TO DRIVE IN A STRAIGHT PATH DOWN THE HIGHWAY. TIRE PRESSURES ARE ALL SET TO SPECIFICATIONS. TEST DROVE TWO ADDITIONAL IDENTICAL MODELS AND HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE. FOUND MANY REPORTS FROM OWNERS ONLINE OF THE SAME PROBLEM. THE STEERING/HANDLING IS VERY DISCONCERTING ON THE NEW WRANGLER JL MODELS. AFTER ONE MONTH WITH THE VEHICLE, DRIVABILITY HASN'T IMPROVED.  HAVE NOTIFIED JEEP DIRECTLY VIA THEIR WEBSITE AND SOCIAL MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES. WILL BE DISCUSSING ISSUE WITH MY DEALERSHIP IN THE NEAR FUTURE.",
