        "summary": "THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED ON AN INCLINE, WITH THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK POINTING UP THE SLOPE.  THE TRANSMISSION WAS SHIFTED FROM DRIVE TO NEUTRAL, THE PARKING BRAKE WAS APPLIED, AND THEN THE TRANSMISSION WAS SHIFTED FROM NEUTRAL TO PARK.  THE VEHICLE WAS LEFT UNATTENDED, AND SHORTLY AFTER THAT, IT ROLLED 10-15 FEET BACKWARDS, WITH THE TRANSMISSION IN PARK, AND THE PARKING BRAKE FULLY APPLIED.  IT WAS FOUND STOPPED ON LEVEL GROUND.  UPON REALIZING WHAT HAPPENED, I REPEATED THE PARKING PROCESS USING THE SAME SHIFT SEQUENCE, D-N-P, WITH THE SAME RESULTS.  ADDITIONALLY, I TRIED PARKING THE TRUCK POINTING DOWN A SLOPE.  IN THIS SITUATION, THE TRUCK ROLLED FORWARD, AND HAD TO BE STOPPED USING THE BRAKE PEDAL.  I IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE DEALER WHO I BOUGHT IT FROM.  THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM AND TOOK NO ACTION TO INVESTIGATE OR REPAIR THE TRANSMISSION.",
