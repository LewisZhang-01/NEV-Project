I WAS DRIVING THE SUV AT LOW SPEED WHEN IT BRIEFLY ACCELERATED, I WAS KIND OF STUNNED, AND ASKED DID YOU FEEL THAT, SHE SAID YES, AND THEN STATED I GUESS I WASN'T IMAGING IT WHEN IT HAPPENED TO ME, THESE WERE SEPARATE ISSUES AT DIFFERENT TIMES AND DATES.  THE VEHICLE WAS BROUGHT IN FOR SERVICE AND THIS ISSUE WAS MENTIONED, THE SERVICE WRITER EXPLAINED THAT ACURA IS AWARE OF THIS AND IT'S AN INTERMITTENT ISSUE AND ACURA HAS NO FIX, IT WAS ASKED WHY ACURA HASN'T WARNED OWNERS OF THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM AND THE SERVICE WRITER EXPLAINED IT'S A INTERMITTENT ISSUE THAT HASN'T BEEN REPLICATED IN SERVICE AND DOESN'T HAPPEN TO ALL THE VEHICLES.
