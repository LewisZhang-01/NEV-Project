THE FACT THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT, SAFETY RELATED MATTER I THINK THAT IT'S A CRIME THAT FORD CAN CONTINUE TO SELL AS MANY NEW VEHICLES AS THEY GET ORDERS FOR AND HAVE NO TROUBLE GETTING AIR BAG COMPONENTS FOR THEM, BUT NOT ABLE TO SUPPLY DEALERS WITH THE PARTS TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATION ON ONES THAT ARE IN NEED OF THEM THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE ROAD! I DON'T DRIVE THE VEHICLE NEARLY AS MUCH AS I USED TO BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY HAZARD RELATED TO THIS MATTER. I'M VERY FORTUNATE, I'VE GOT ANOTHER VEHICLE TO DRIVE, MANY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THAT OPTION.   TO SUM IT ALL UP, I FEEL THAT THAT FORD SHOULD BE DOING MORE TO CORRECT A SAFETY RELATED DEFECT IN THESE VEHICLES THAT IS PART OF A RECALL THAT I WAS NOTIFIED ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO!  THEY SHOULD EITHER FIX THESE VEHICLES OR BUY THEM BACK. I WOULD PREFER THAT THEY FIX THEM AS I REALLY ENJOY THIS CAR BUT DON'T FEEL SAFE PUTTING MYSELF OR MY PASSENGERS AT RISK BY DRIVING IT ANYMORE!",
