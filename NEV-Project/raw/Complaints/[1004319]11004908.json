THIS CAR IS 2 YEARS OLD AND $120 IS WHAT VW CHARGES TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM THEN WILL DECIDE WHAT PORTION I SHOULD PAY ACCORDING TO THE SERVICE DEPT. MANAGER AT VILLAGE VW IN CHATTANOOGA, TN. I WAS TOLD IT IS WARRANTED FOR 36,000 MILES. I'M ASSUMING THAT THESE ARE \"ALL\" MESSED UP AFTER GOING TO A COUPLE OF WEBSITES AND READING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS HUNDREDS OF OTHERS ARE HAVING..THERE HAS BEEN NO ACCIDENT BUT I AM CONCERNED FOR MY DAUGHTERS SAFETY DRIVING WITH THESE LETHAL AIRBAGS. I WAS TOLD THIS OCCURS QUITE OFTEN AND OCCASIONALLY VW WILL PARTIALLY REIMBURSE FOR THIS PART AS THEY HAVE NOT DECIDED (OR BEEN FORCED) TO RECALL THIS YET. THIS IS A DEFECTIVE PART AND SHOULD BE EXAMINED CLOSER FOR A RECALL AND IMMEDIATE REPAIR. CHARGING $120 TO RESET THE LIGHT IS NOT A N ADEQUATE SOLUTION.",
