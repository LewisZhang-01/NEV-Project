MY HEADLAMPS ARE SUBSTANDARD, AND DO NOT SHINE BRIGHT A NIGHT AS THE XENON HEADLAMPS ON THE COMPETITORS OF VOLKSWAGEN.  FOR A $40,000 VEHICLE, IT'S AN EXPECTATION TO HAVE XENON HEADLAMPS, WHICH ARE MUCH SAFER THAN THE EXISTING HEADLAMPS ON THE VW PASSAT.  VOLKSWAGEN HAS BEEN INSTALLING 280 HP V6 ENGINES IN ITS PASSAT SINCE THE 2006 MODEL WHILE THEIR COMPETITORS HAVE BEEN INSTALLING 330HP AND UP IN THEIR V6 MODELS.  THE VW PASSAT SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST 350HP/380 TORQUE WITH ALL WHEEL DRIVE, WITH A LONGITUDINAL ENGINE.  IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS THAT THE EXECUTIVES AT VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA, AND VOLKSWAGEN AG ARE INTERESTED IN SACRIFICING QUALITY AND SAFETY TO SAVE A DOLLAR.",
