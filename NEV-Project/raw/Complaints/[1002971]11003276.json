        "summary": "THE FORD EXPLORER 2014 HAS A DEFECT IN WHICH THE \"TERRAIN MANAGEMENT \" SIGNAL/MESSAGE WOULD RANDOMLY APPEAR AND PRACTICALLY IMMOBILIZE THE CAR. ONCE THE SIGNAL WAS PRESENT, THE VEHICLE WOULD SLOW DOWN TO A 5-10 MPH MODE. IT WOULD EVENTUALLY RESET ITSELF AFTER 24 HOURS OR SO.     THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS DUE TO THE FACT THAT IF THIS WERE TO TAKE PLACE IN THE MIDDLE OF A VERY BUSY INTERSECTION OR A HIGHWAY, AN ACCIDENT WOULD CERTAINLY ENSUE. I EXPERIENCED THIS MALFUNCTION TWICE; ONCE IN FEBRUARY OF 2017 AND THEN AGAIN ON JULY 3, 2017. IN BOTH INSTANCES, I WAS IN MOTION. THANKFULLY, I WAS NOT TOO FAR FROM MY RESIDENCE AND THAT I WAS ABLE TO QUICKLY TURN ON MY HAZARD LIGHTS SO THAT OTHERS IN TRAFFIC WOULD BE ABLE TO AVOID HITTING ME BECAUSE OF THE SUDDEN DECLINE IN SPEED.",
