        "summary": "\"TAKATA RECALL\" MY ACCORD'S STEERING HAS A WEIRD VIBRATION GOING OVER 30 - 60 MPH. IT FEELS LIKE MY FRONT WHEELS WOBBLES. AFTER MAKING SURE THE WHEELS WERE OK, ITS LATER FOUND THAT THERE IS A STEERING LEAK. BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE, IT IS IMPACTING THE WEARING OF THE TIRES UNEVENLY. AFTER I ROTATED AND BALANCED IT, THE PROBLEM IS STILL THERE.  THE HONDA DEALER WANTS TO CHARGE MORE THAN $4500 DOLLARS TO REPLACE BUT AFTER READING SO MANY SIMILAR ISSUES IT APPEARS THAT IT CONTINUES TO SHAKE AND VIBRATE. NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED TO HONDA RELIABILITY BUT, IT IS TROUBLING. I WENT TO HAVE THEM ADDRESS THE TAKATA RECALL BUT I KEEP GETTING CALLS FROM THEM WHEN I ALREADY WENT TO GET IT \"FIXED\". NOT SURE IF THEY ACTUALLY DID THE JOB BECAUSE I CALLED THEM BACK AND I HAVE THE NOTIFICATION STATING THAT THE WORK WAS DONE, BUT ANOTHER DEPARTMENT WAS TELLING ME IT WASN'T DONE. I HOPE THIS IS NOT HAPPENING ELSEWHERE.",
