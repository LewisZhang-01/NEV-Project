        "summary": "I HAD BOTH RECALLS REGARDING THE COMPUTER MODULE REPROGRAMMING PERFORMED (#14M02 AND #15B22) BUT MY CAR STILL EXPERIENCES SPUTTERING BETWEEN GEARS. TOOK THE CAR IN FOR ANOTHER RECALL REGARDING THE DOOR LATCHES ON 7/10/17 AND DURING THE TRANSMISSION CHECK, MY FORD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME THAT I HAD A FAULTY DUAL CLUTCH FAILED AND THAT IT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. COST OF REPLACEMENT IS OVER $2000 AT ALL AMERICAN FORD IN HACKENSACK SO DUE TO THE EXPENSIVE FINANCIAL BURDEN, I UNFORTUNATELY DECLINED TO HAVE THE SERVICE PERFORMED TO REPLACE THE DUAL CLUTCH SHUDDER.     ACCORDING TO THIS ARTICLE FROM A LOCAL NEWS STATION IN NORTH CAROLINA (HTTP://WLOS.COM/NEWS/NEWS-13-INVESTIGATES/FORD-SUED-OVER-FAULTY-TRANSMISSIONS-IN-SOME-FOCUS-FIESTAS) \"IN 2014, FORD EXTENDED THE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY ON THE VEHICLES FROM 5 YEARS AND 60,000 MILES TO 7 YEARS AND 100,000 MILES TO COVER THE CLUTCH SHUDDER BUT ONLY ON CARS BUILT BEFORE JUNE OF 2013.\"     UNFORTUNATELY, MY CAR WAS ASSEMBLED AFTER THAT TIME. I MENTIONED THIS TO MY FORD SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE UPON PICKUP OF MY VEHICLE AND HE ACKNOWLEDGED AND ADMITTED THAT THE TRANSMISSION IN FIESTAS IN 2014 ARE THE SAME AND THAT FORD PROBABLY SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL VEHICLES MADE AFTER JUNE OF 2013.     FORD SHOULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND EXTEND THE WARRANTIES TO ALL 2014 FORD FIESTAS JUST AS THEY DID FOR FIESTAS AND FOCUSES MADE BEFORE JUNE 2013.",
