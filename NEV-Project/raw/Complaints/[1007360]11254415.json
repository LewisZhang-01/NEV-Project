        "summary": "2013 FORD EDGE LIMITED 45K MILES TAMPA FL  - CAR WILL RANDOMLY GO INTO LIMP MODE WITHOUT WARNING AT ANY TIME, ALL LIGHTS ON DASH COME ON ALONG WITH THE WRENCH.  THIS HAS HAPPENED ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, TWO ON A BUSY 4 LANE CITY STREET ABOVE 40 MPH AND THE LAST WAS WHILE MERGING ONTO THE INTERSTATE ABOVE 50 MPH.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS DEFECT THAT WILL EVENTUALLY RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT. ONCE IN LIMP MODE I WILL HAVE TO PULL OVER, STOP AND RESTART THE CAR AT WHICH POINT THE CAR DRIVES NORMAL.  DEALER CAN'T  REPLICATE THE FAULT, SO THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING.  I HAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY THROUGH 75K MILES BUT CAN'T USE THAT EITHER AS THE FORD DEALER CAN'T REPLICATE THE PROBLEM.   THROUGH RESEARCH I FOUND  THE SAME SYMPTOMS ON OTHER FORDS WHERE THE THROTTLE BODY WAS AN ISSUE INCLUDING MY YEAR EDGE.  FORD DID A RECALL ON A BUNCH BUT MY YEAR AND MODEL WERE NOT INCLUDED.  CLEARLY FORD NEEDS TO EXPAND THEIR RECALL AS THIS IS EXTREMELY UNSAFE.",
