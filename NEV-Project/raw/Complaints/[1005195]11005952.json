MY TOYOTA DEALERSHIP SAID THEY WERE UNABLE TO GET THE STICKER AND I HAD TO CALL TOYOTA DIRECTLY. I JUST GOT OFF OF A 25 MINUTE PHONE CONVERSATION WITH TOYOTA AND THE RESULT WAS THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHY THE DEALERSHIP COULDN'T HANDLE IT AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO CONTACT THE DEALERSHIP. I ASKED THAT THE STICKER JUST BE SENT TO ME IF IT WAS JUST A STICKER AND I WAS UNABLE TO WAIT ON HOLD ANY LONGER. TOYOTA SAID THEY COULD NOT CONTINUE TO HELP ME UNLESS I STAYED ON HOLD WHILE THEY TALKED TO THE DEALERSHIP. I UNDERSTAND IT IS \"JUST A STICKER\" AS BOTH TOYOTA AND THE DEALERSHIP HAS INFORMED ME. HOWEVER, I WANT THE RECALL CLEARED FROM MY VEHICLE. I AM SEEKING ASSISTANCE IN GETTING THE STICKER SENT TO ME AS REQUIRED. SEEMS LIKE IT IS A SIMPLE TRANSACTION, BUT TOYOTA IS NOT MAKING IT SO. MY ADDRESS AND INFORMATION IS CORRECT WITH TOYOTA UNDER MY VIN. THANK YOU.",
