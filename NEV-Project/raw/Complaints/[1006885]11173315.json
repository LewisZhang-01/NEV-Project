THE ISSUE IS ESPECIALLY PREVALENT DURING LOW-SPEED MANEUVERS AND CAN BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE FAILURE OF OTHER SYSTEMS SUCH AS THE RADIO, STABILITY CONTROL, DOOR-LOCK CYCLING, AIR CONDITION OR CRUISE CONTROL. THIS HAPPENS RANDOMLY, WHEN I'M PARKING OR MAKING A TURN. I ALMOST CRASHED INTO A VEHICLE IN MID TURN AS I LOST POWER STEERING AND THE VEHICLE SHUT OFF. I PUT IT IN PARK AND RESTARTED THE TRUCK.",
