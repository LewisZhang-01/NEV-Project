AIRBAGS ARE DISENGAGED, AND I CAN'T FIND OUT WHY WITHOUT PAYING MORE MONEY THAN I HAVE TO SPEND BECAUSE EACH COMPONENT HAS TO BE CHECKED, AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE ACTUALLY FIXING THE PROBLEM, JUST FIGURING OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. I'VE SEEN THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS. PASSENGER AIRBAG SENSOR STARTED ACTING WEIRD/ NOT WORKING FIRST. OCCURRED AROUND 100 K MILES. WHEN WILL A RECALL HAPPEN? THIS IS APPARENTLY A COMMON SAFETY ISSUE.",
