NO REASON FOR THE FAILURE. DOESN'T ACT LIKE A LOW BATTERY. I CHARGED THE BATTERY, AND JUMPED IT WITH NO SUCCESS. AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS I WOULD GO INSIDE AND RETURNED IN 30 MINUTES OR SO,TRY AGAIN; SOMETIME IT WOULD START. AFTER SEVERAL TIMES, IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, OF THE CAR NOT STARTING I PURCHASED A NEW BATTERY; SAME THING. I DO NOTHING TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM, OTHER THAN WAIT A BIT AND TRY AGAIN.  MY ONLINE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THIS IS HAPPENING TO OFTEN. MANY PEOPLE HAVE THERE CAR TAKEN TO DEALERSHIP AND THEY FIND NOTHING. IT JUST STARTS WITHOUT ANY SERVICE, AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR SHOPS AND DEALERSHIPS COULDN'T FIND WHAT CAUSES THE ENGINE TO FAIL TO START OCCASIONALLY. I NOTICED THAT IF IT WON'T START AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS, I GO AWAY FOR A WHILE AND TRY AGAIN. FOR UNKNOWN REASONS THE CAR WILL START; SOMETIME ON THE FIRST ATTEMPT.  THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING AND COULD BE COSTLY FOR THOSE NOT PATIENT ENOUGH TO TRY AGAIN AND AGAIN.",
