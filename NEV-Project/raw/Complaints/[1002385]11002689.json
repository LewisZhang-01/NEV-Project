        "summary": "WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK OF PURCHASING THIS MOTORCYCLE NEW FROM A DEALERSHIP, VEHICLE HAS BEGUN STALLING. THE ISSUE OCCURS MAINLY WHEN DOWNSHIFTING FROM 3RD TO 2ND AND BLIPPING THE THROTTLE TO MATCH REVS. THERE IS A LOUD METALLIC PING THAT CAN BE FELT THROUGH THE HANDLEBARS, FOLLOWED BY A TOTAL STALL OF THE ENGINE. HAPPENS WHEN ENGINE IS FULLY WARMED UP, BUT HAS HAPPENED COLD. QUICK APPLICATION OF THROTTLE FROM IDLE SOMETIMES RESULTS IN A PING, BUT NOT A STALL. A STALL HAS OCCURRED 6 TIMES FOR ME WITHIN 500 MILES, SEVERAL TIME WHILE IN HEAVY TRAFFIC AND ONCE IN A BLIND CURVE, NEARLY CAUSING A CRASH. MY BIKE HAS NOW BEEN IN THE SHOP FOR NEARLY 4 WEEKS WHILE A REPAIR IS ATTEMPTED. THIS IS A WELL-DOCUMENTED ISSUE WITHIN THE TRIUMPH ENTHUSIAST COMMUNITY, BUT NOTHING HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY ADDRESSED BY THE MANUFACTURER. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT COULD CAUSE DEATH OR INJURY.",
