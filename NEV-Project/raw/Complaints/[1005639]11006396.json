ON 7/14/2017 I WAS DRIVING MY VEHICLE ON THE HIGHWAY AT IT JUST STOPS WHILE GOING 45MPH.  LUCKILY I DIDN'T HAVE AN ACCIDENT.  BEFORE THIS HAPPENED, MY ENGINE STARTED MAKING THIS LOUD TAPPING SOUND.  I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO MAKE IT TO MY RESIDENCE BUT WAS TOO AFRAID TO EVEN DRIVE THE CAR.  I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE SAFETY RECALL UNTIL I DID SOME RESEARCH.  I CALLED KIA AND FOUND OUT THAT MY VIN WAS PART OF THE RECALL.  I CALLED MY PREFERRED DEALER AND THEY WEREN'T ALREADY BACK LOGGED REGARDING THIS RECALL.  SUBSEQUENTLY, AFTER GETTING MY VEHICLE TOWED, I WAS INFORMED THAT MY ENGINE BLEW UP EVEN BEFORE KIA COULD PERFORM THIS TEST.      MY FEAR IS THAT MORE CARS WILL BE AFFECTED AND THERE ARE SEVERAL CUSTOMERS (INCLUDING MYSELF) THAT HAVE NOT RECEIVED NOTICES ABOUT THIS RECALL.  MANY DEALERS ARE NOT HANDLING THIS PROPERLY PER THE INTERIM NOTICES BY KIA (IE PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION TO CUSTOMERS, ETC)",
