ALSO AT TIMES, WHEN PRESSING THE GAS TO ACCELERATE QUICKLY, THE TRANSMISSION WILL NOT SHIFT OR DO ANYTHING, IT JUST SITS THERE AND THINKS FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN SLAMS INTO GEAR. THIS IS ALL HAPPENING WHEN IN MOTION. IT IS ALSO JERKY AT TIMES WHEN TAKING OFF FROM A STOP.  WHEN SHIFTING FROM PARK TO REVERSE THE VEHICLE SLAMS INTO GEAR CAUSING A HARSH JOLT AFTER THE VEHICLE HAS SAT GREATER THAN 4 HOURS. I HAVE BEEN TO A LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP ON FOUR OCCASIONS. THE TECHNICIANS CLAIM THIS IS NORMAL FOR THE 2013 FUSION.",
