        "summary": "While operating the 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee, the instrument cluster acts as if it's disconnected..., Speedodemeter, Tachometer, fuel gauge, and temperature gage all go to zero, yet the engine continues to run without interruption.  Then, with no rhyme or reason, the entire dashboard lights up (as if just turning the car on).  All of this occurs within 26 seconds.  No effect on the radio, A/C, etc., only seems to affect the instrument cluster.  Not sure if the lights/brake lights/turn signals work when this occurs.     I have a video, but cannot upload via this website - it is a .mov file.",
