IT IS NOW THE BEGINNING OF JULY AND I HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY UPDATES AND NO REPAIRS. I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO DRIVE WITH PASSENGERS IN THE FRONT SEAT AND I FEEL UNSAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR PARTS AND NOTIFICATION OF REPAIR FOR OVER THREE MONTHS. MY INITIAL LETTER STATES THAT IF MY RECALL IS NOT COMPLETED IN A TIMELY MANNER THAT I SHOULD FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE NHTSA, AND I AM DOING THAT NOW. PLEASE HELP ME GET MY VEHICLE REPAIRED.",
