SUDDENLY THE CAR ALARM BEEPS. DASH BOARD DISPLAYED \"HYBRID SYSTEM WARNING, SAFELY STOP AND DO NOT DRIVE\". THE GAS PEDAL WAS HARD TO PRESS, (GUESS IT GOES INTO PROTECTION MODE. ) FORTUNATELY IT WAS IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC THAT NO CAR  RAM INTO ME FROM BEHIND. I FORCED THE CAR SWITCHED LANES AND EXIT FREEWAY. AFTER I PARKED, THE CAR FROZED. I CAN'T TURN ON THE EMERGENCY SIGNAL. CAN'T SWITCH THE GEAR TO PARK, CAN'T TURN OFF THE ENGINE... I EXIT THE CAR AND WAVE CARS BEHIND ME MOVE AHEAD, THEN I GOT BACK THE CAR AND WAS ABLE TO TURN OFF THE ENGINE. AFTER IT WAS OFF FOR 30 SECONDS, I CAN TURN THE ENGINE BACK ON AND THE CAR FUNCTIONS LIKE NORMAL. IT WAS UNDER 18000 MILES. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAYS THE COOLANT LEAK AND REPLACED IT.     5/15/17, WHILE DRIVING ON FREEWAY, I FELT THE CAR WAS INTO PROTECTION MODE, HARD TO PRESS THE ACCELERATOR. BUT THE ALARM DIDN'T SOUND OFF. I SENT IT IN AND THE SERVICE COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM SO THEY RESET THE COMPUTER OF THE CAR.     6/5/17 THE CAR WAS PARKED IN HOT SUN IN PS FOR 30 MINUTES WHILE ME AND MY REALTOR GO TO CHECK A HOUSE. I STARTED THE CAR FOLLOWING MY REALTOR. I TURNED ON THE AC AND THE ALARM GOES OFF, SAME WARNING SIGN DISPLAYED AND THE CAR JUST FROZE. HYUNDAI SENT A TOW TRUCK AN HOUR LATER.
