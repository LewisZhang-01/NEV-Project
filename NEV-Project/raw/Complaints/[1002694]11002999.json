        "summary": "MY VEHICLE BEGAN STALLING WHILE STOPPED AT TRAFFIC LIGHTS APPROXIMATELY ONCE A WEEK  ABOUT 3 MONTHS AGO. THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT RESTART UNTIL AFTER SITTING FOR AT LEAST 1 HOUR AND WOULD RESTART AND RUN AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED. I HAD MY MECHANIC INSPECT THE VEHICLE AND THERE WERE NO CODES TO INDICATE THE PROBLEM SO HE CHANGED THE LOW PRESSURE FUEL PUMP. THE PROBLEM CONTINUED 1 WEEK AFTER PUMP REPLACEMENT. MY MECHANIC SUGGESTED I TAKE THE VEHICLE TO A BMW DEALERSHIP FOR INSPECTION. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO BMW GLOBAL IMPORTS IN ATLANTA. THEIR MECHANIC SUGGESTED I CHANGE THE BATTERY AND SPARK PLUGS. THE REP SAID THERE WERE A LOT OF LOW VOLTAGE ERRORS WHICH MAY HAVE CAUSED THE STALLING. THE VEHICLE NEVER RAN ROUGH AND AND WOULD ALWAYS START EXCEPT AFTER STALLING. SO I CHANGED THE BATTERY AND THE VEHICLE BEGAN STALLING 1 HOUR AFTER INSTALLATION AND THE PROBLEM BECAME MORE FREQUENT.  THE ORIGINAL BATTERY WAS TESTED AND DID NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS. THE ORIGINAL BATTERY WAS PUT BACK IN THE VEHICLE AND NOW THE VEHICLE WILL SHUT DOWN IN 1 HOUR.  MY ORIGINAL MECHANIC ALSO ATTEMPTED TO RE-FLASH OR UPDATE ALL THE COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND IT STILL STALLS. THE SCREEN ALWAYS DISPLAYS \"FUEL SYSTEM MALFUNCTION\" WHEN THE ERROR OCCURS. THE PROBLEM ONLY OCCURS WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STOPPED. NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND I HAVE HEARD STORIES OF OTHER BMW OWNERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.",
