AFTER DRIVING THE CAR THE KEY WOULD NOT TURN TO TURN OFF THE CAR. NO MATTER WHAT I CAN NOT GET THE KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION. I ONLY GOT THE MOTOR TO SHUT OFF BECAUSE MY SON KNEW TO PULL A FUSE AND THEN TAKE OFF A BATTERY CABLE.  THIS IGNITION PROBLEM IS SERIOUS AND IS A SAFETY ISSUE IF YOU CAN'T TURN OFF THE CAR.",
