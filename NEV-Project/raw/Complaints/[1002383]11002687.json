IT ALSO HAS A PROBLEM OF BINDING UP WHEN YOU TURN THE WHEELS AT SAME TIME OF ACCELERATING.  THE VEHICLE ALSO TRIES TO WALK OVER ITSELF.  IT ALSO WILL HAVE DELAYS WITHIN THE TRANSMISSION.  YOU BEGIN TO ACCELERATE BUT IT DOESNT GO THERES A DELAY AND THEN IT SHOOTS OUT LIKE A BULLET.  I HAVE HAD MY DEALERSHIP CHECK IT OUT AND THEY SAY ITS FINE.  OTHER YEARS AND MODELS THEY HAVE EXTENDED WARRANTY BECAUSE OF COMPLAINTS BUT NOT MINE FOR WHATEVER REASON.",
