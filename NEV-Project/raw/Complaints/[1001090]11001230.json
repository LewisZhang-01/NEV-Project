I ALSO SAW THAT WITHOUT WARNING THE STEERING CAN STOP ALL TOGETHER CAUSING AN ACCIDENT. I ALSO SAW THAT SOMETIMES YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE VEHICLE AND START IT UP AGAIN AND THE STEERING PROBLEM MAY GO AWAY. THIS IS VERY ALARMING. WHAT IF I AM DRIVING AND THE STEERING GOES OUT? THIS, OF COURSE, CAN LEAD TO INJURY OR DEATH TO THE DRIVER OR TO OTHERS INVOLVED IN A CRASH.",
