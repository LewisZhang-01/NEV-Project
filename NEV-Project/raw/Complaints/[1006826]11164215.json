SPRAYING OIL ALL OVER IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND CAUSING ME TO LOSE ALL OF MY OIL ON THE GROUND AND ALL OVER THE ENGINE UNKNOWN IF THIS IS CAUSED ANY OTHER PROBLEMS INSIDE THE ENGINE YET EVERY TIME THIS IS HAPPENED I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GET ON THE FREEWAY I WAS ABLE TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND HAVE IT TAKEN CARE OF WITH MINIMAL DRIVING WITHOUT OIL .
