FOUND THAT THE ENGINE HAD STALLED AND WOULDN'T RESTART. FOUND #27 FUSE MELTED. CHANGED FUSE AND WAS ABLE TO RESTART ENGINE. I DON'T LIKE REPAIRING FORD'S ENGINEERING MISTAKES, NOR DO I LIKE BEING PUT IN DANGER BECAUSE OF THEM.    I USE THIS TRUCK FOR WORK AND HAVE A LIFETIME'S ACCUMULATION OF SPECIALTY TOOLS KEPT IN THIS TRUCK FOR MY JOB. IF THE TRUCK GOES UP IN FLAMES, WILL FORD REPLACE WHAT IS LOST? THE WAY THIS FUSE, FUSE BOX, AND THE CONNECTION HAS FAILED LOOKS AS THERE CAN POTENTIALLY BE A FIRE. IN MY CASE, THERE WAS AN INTERRUPTION IN NORMAL TRAFFIC FLOW, AT HIGH SPEED, THAT COULD A RESULTED IN A WRECK, INJURY, DEATH, ETC.    I WILL FIX THIS, PROBABLY ON MY OWN DIME. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY IS THIS NOT REQUIRED TO BE FIXED BY FORD. IT'S AN OBVIOUS SAFETY HAZARD THAT EVEN FORD HAS ACKNOWLEDGED AND PROVIDED A TSB TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.",
