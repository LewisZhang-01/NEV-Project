        "summary": "While driving on the highway, my Explorer did a sudden jolt and I had no control over the vehicle. It acted as though it was no in gear. I almost crashed going 60 mph on a 4 lane highway. It then did another large jolt and revved high into the red line. I took it to Firestone and they recommended that I take it to the dealership to check the transmission. I called the dealership and they advised me to drive it over. They told me it was \"probably the transmission as Explorers are notarious for transmission issues.\" The dealership inspected the Explorer and confirmed that it was a known transmission issue involving codes P0798 and P098. The dealership advised that there were MULTIPLE pressure code errors [that never did a warning] and that the transmission required replacement. I asked if it was covered under warranty and the dealership advised me that Ford had no issued a recall yet, even though it was a known and serious transmission issue. The dealership recommended that I call Ford Customer Care at 1-800-392-3673 and request that Ford cover the replacement. I called Ford Customer Care and spoke with Bruno who advised me that it was indeed a known issue and that I \"was not the only one with this issue\" and that \"there will be a recall soon so [I] can get reimbursed.\" Bruno was to have a supervisor call me within 24 hours. It has been almost 2 weeks and there has been no response from Ford. This is a well known issue that Ford knows of. There has been recalls of other Explorers for the same problem but my VIN is not included for some reason. If you go online, there are thousands of complaints. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE SOMEONE DIES OR IS SERIOUSLY INJURED. I have the telephone recordings of Ford but I am unable to upload them here.",
