THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY, NOTHING WAS ON, NO ELECTRICAL DEVICES PLUGGED IN.  IT HADN'T BEEN DRIVEN IN SEVERAL HOURS, NO ONE WAS IN THE CAR (DOORS WERE STILL LOCKED, THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM NO LONGER OPERATED AND THE  WINDOWS HAD TO BE BROKEN TO GET INTO THE VEHICLE).  THE FIRE MELTED THE FRONT DASH, ESPECIALLY ON THE PASSENGER SIDE, SMOLDERED FOR QUITE A WHILE, AND WAS HOT ENOUGH TO CRACK THE FRONT WINDSHIELD.  THERE IS EXTENSIVE FIRE AND SMOKE DAMAGE TO THE CAR.",
