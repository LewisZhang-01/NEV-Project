        "summary": "THE BACK GLASS EXPLODED!!!! I BOUGHT THIS CAR 3 YEARS AGO FROM MY MOTHER-IN-LAW AFTER MY FATHER-IN-LAW HAD A STROKE TO HELP THEM OUT. THE REASON I AM TELLING YOU THAT IS TO SHOW HOW IT HAS BEEN TAKEN CAR OF. LUCKILY I WAS PARKED WHEN THIS HAPPENED BUT IT SHOOK ME UP PRETTY GOOD! I DID NOT KNOW WHAT CAUSED SUCH A EXPLOSION. I WAS IN THE DRIVER SEAT ABOUT TO LEAVE A DRIVEWAY WHEN IT HAPPENED I AM TALKING EXPLODED! IT WAS A OVERSIZED DOUBLE CAR DRIVEWAY THE GLASS BLEW FROM GRASS ON ONE SIDE TO GLASS ON THE OTHER SIDE! NOTHING HIT IT , IT WAS NOT TOOOOO AWFULLY HOT, NO ONE WAS AROUND. I WAS IN THE FRONT SEAT ABOUT TO LEAVE! THE GLASS DID DO WHAT IS INTENDED AND SHATTERED BUTTTTTTTTTTTTT BY EXPLOSION! I CALLED MY HUSBAND (I AM STILL IN SHOCK) SO HE TOLD ME TO CALL OUT INSURANCE GUY TO SEE IF IT IS SOMETHING THEY WILL COVER. IN THE MEANTIME MY HUSBAND LOOKED UP THIS PROBLEM BY TYPING IN FORD ESCAPES BACK WINDOW EXPLODING IT WILL POP UP SEVERAL PICTURES OF THIS HAPPENING! I DID CALL FORD ALL THEY CAN SAY IS THEY WILL REPORT IT.  MY PROBLEM IS 1) WHAT IF I WAS NOT IN THE CAR..... I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I GOT VANDALIZED 2) WHAT IF I HAD BEEN DRIVING? 3) WHAT IF I HAD BEEN DRIVING AND SOMEONE WALKING BY (LIKE IN A PARKING LOT WITH A BABY) OR BLEW OUT ALL OVER OTHER CARS? 4) WHAT IF I WAS IN A STORE AND PEOPLE WALKED BY AND IT SHATTERED ALL OVER THEM?  IN MY CASE NONE OF THIS HAPPENED BUT IT COULD SINCE APPARENTLY IT IS HAPPENING A LOT.",
