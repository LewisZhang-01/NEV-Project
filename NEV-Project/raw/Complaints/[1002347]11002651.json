WHILE DRIVING, THE STEERING HAS THE TENDENCY TO LOCK UP/CREATE RESISTANCE FOR A FEW SECONDS AS A RESULT THE CAR WANDERS INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC OR INTO THE OTHER LANE/SHOULDER OF THE ROAD UNTIL IT BREAKS FREE WHICH THEN CAUSES THE VEHICLE TO SWERVE OUT OF CONTROL AND I REGAIN CONTROL. I TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC FOR AN ESTIMATE. THE FAULT IDENTIFIED WAS THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING MOTOR AND RACK AND PINION SYSTEM WAS NO GOOD. THE CAR HAS BEEN PARKED FOR A YEAR BECAUSE IT IS TOO UNSAFE TO DRIVE.",
