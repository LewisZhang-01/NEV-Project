IT WAS ABOUT 20 DEGREE INCLINE.  I BELIEVE THAT ALL AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION SHOULD NOT ROLL BACKWARD.  I BROUHT IT UP TO ONE OF THE TOYOTA SERVICE ADVISOR WHEN I TOOK MY CAR THERE FOR SERVICE, HE SAID THAT IS NORMAL WHEN CAR IS IN DRIVE MODE.  I BELIEVE THIS IS A CRITICAL  SAFETY ISSUE.  IT WAS ROLLED BACK ABOUT 1 FOOT BEFORE I HIT THE GAS PEDAL. I ALMOST GOT AN ACCIDENT.  PLEASE INVESTIGATE THIS.  THANKS.",
