        "summary": "VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION AT 45MPH WHEN THE REAR AXLE FRACTURED COMPLETELY, CAUSING ME TO VEER INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC (LUCKILY THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT).   VEHICLE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN IN FOR INITIAL REAR AXLE RECALL IN 2010 (10S13), WHERE SUPPORT BRACKETS WERE PLACED ON EXISTING AXLE. REVISITED THE DEALER FOR THE SECONDARY RECALL IN 2017, AND WAS ONCE AGAIN ASSURED THAT THE AXLE WAS GOOD.   AXLE BROKE TWO MONTHS LATER (07/03/17).   FORD WILL OFFER NO ASSISTANCE AND CONSIDERS MY RECALL COMPLETE SINCE THEY PUT BRACKETS ON THE AXLE.   THIS DEFECT IS LIFE-THREATENING. FORD'S \"BRACKET\" SOLUTION DOES NOT WORK - THERE ARE MANY OTHERS LIKE ME WHO HAVE HAD THE AXLES FAIL AFTER THIS 'REPAIR'. THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO REPLACE ALL OF THE AXLES COMPLETELY. PUT SIMPLY - AS THESE VEHICALES CONTINUE TO AGE AND THE AXLES RUST FURTHER, THIS DEFECT WILL EVENTUALLY RESULT IN DEATHS.",
