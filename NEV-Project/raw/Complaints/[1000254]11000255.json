        "summary": "ABOUT 15 MILES INTO MY DRIVE TO WORK IN MY 2015 LEXUS RX 450H WITH ONLY 6,300 MILES, MY DASH PANEL INDICATED THE FOLLOWING ERRORS: CHECK ABS, CHECK BSM SYSTEM, CHECK HEADLIGHT LEVELING SYSTEM, BRAKE MALFUNCTION, CHECK HYBRID SYSTEM, CHECK POWER STEERING SYSTEM, SPEEDOMETER AT 0 MPH AND EVERY POSSIBLE ERROR LIGHT POSSIBLE. AS I ATTEMPTED TO SLOW DOWN FROM 65 MPH ON THE INTERSTATE 5, I NOTICED I WAS EXPERIENCING COMPLETE BRAKE FAILURE AND WERE NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY. WITH AGGRESSIVE FORCE, I WAS ABLE TO ENGAGE THE BRAKES BUT NOTICED AN EXTREMELY LOUD METAL ON METAL SOUND WHEN DOING SO. IN ORDER TO COME TO A STOP, I EXITED AT THE FIRST OFF-RAMP POSSIBLE, AND POPPED THE CURVE SO I COULD PARK THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO LEXUS OF GLENDALE WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE ALL THE ERROR CODES BUT WERE UNABLE TO REPAIR THE ISSUE SINCE THEY WERE UNABLE TO DUPLICATE IT. MY VEHICLE WAS BORROWED FOR 4 DAYS WITH THE TECHNICIAN DRIVING APPROXIMATELY 100 MILES BEFORE RETURNING THE VEHICLE BACK TO ME WITH NO REPAIRS MADE. I FEAR THIS IS AN SEVERE SAFETY RISK THAT CAN LEAD TO A POTENTIALLY FATAL OUTCOME.  PLEASE NOTE, I ALSO HAVE A 18 SECOND VIDEO OF THE ERRORS OCCURRING WHILE I WAS DRIVING IN THE FIRST LANE PRIOR TO MY ATTEMPT TO STOP THE VEHICLE.",
