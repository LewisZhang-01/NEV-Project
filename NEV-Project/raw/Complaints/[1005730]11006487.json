MY TOYOTA SUFFERED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE COMPARED TO THE DAMAGE OF THE CRV. WHEN I LOOK AT MY CAR I FIND THAT THERE IS NO STEEL BUMPER AT THE EXTREME LEFT OR RIGHT OF THE VEHICLE. MY CAR WAS STATIONARY. SINCE THERE IS NO BUMPER TO PROTECT THE VEHICLE THE ENTIRE PANELS ON THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT SHIFTED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT. THIS IS MEDIOCRE AND FRAUDULENT ENGINEERING FROM TOYOTA. IT IS ALSO A SAFETY ISSUE.",
