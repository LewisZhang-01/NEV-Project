SINCE I HAVE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE, I NOTICED LOUD NOISES COMING FROM THE BRAKES WHEN APPLYING PRESSURE TO STOP THE VEHICLE. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT WHILE DRIVING IT MAKES A KNOCKING SOUND. I WAS TOLD BY ONE OF THERE MECHANICS IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT THAT IT WAS OK! THE EQUINOX IS KNOWN TO MAKE A LITTLE NOISE WHILE DRIVING. IT HAS BEEN TO THERE SHOP OVER 3 TIMES FOR SEVERAL DAYS AT A TIME IN LESS THAN A MONTH AND STILL THE PROBLEM CONTINUES. THEY EXPLAINED EVERYTHING THEY FIXED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NOISE WAS GONE AND THE BRAKES WERE IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION. WHEN I ASKED  FOR PROOF THEY WERE UNABLE TO PROVIDE IT. I AM NOT A MECHANIC BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE FOR ONE MINUTE THIS VEHICLE SHOULD BE MAKING ANY NOISE AT ALL LET ALONE NOISES WHEN YOU APPLY PRESSURE TO THE BRAKES. I HAVE REITERATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO RICK HENDRICKS CHEVY DULUTH THAT THERE IS A BRAKE ISSUE GOING ON WITH THE VEHICLE THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE DEADLY AND I WAS TOLD THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.  I TRY TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF DRIVING I DO TO IMPORTANT PLACES ONLY SEEING AS THE NOISE IS STILL THERE.",
