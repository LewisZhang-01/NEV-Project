NOT ONCE HAVE THEY CHECKED THE WIRING. THE ENGAGEMENT HAPPENS WHEN STATIONARY (UNLOCKING THE CAR). SOMETIMES WHEN I TURN AT VERY LOW SPEEDS. THE LIGHTS COME ONE WHEN DRIVING HIGH SPEED BUT NOTHING HAPPENS. THE FOLLOWING LIGHTS TURN ON: 4WHEEL SERVICE, ELECTRONIC STABILITY. I FEEL IT IS A WIRING PROBLEM.",
