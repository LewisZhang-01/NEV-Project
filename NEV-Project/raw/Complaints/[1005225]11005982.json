HOWEVER, WITH FIVE FAMILY MEMBERS, THIS IS NOT A VIABLE SOLUTION FOR MY FAMILY.  WE CANNOT FIT ALL OF US, LET ALONE GUESTS, IN THE CAR AND STILL AVOID THE RECALLED AIR BAG.  TOYOTA HAS BEEN GOOD ABOUT ISSUING RECALLS AND PROVIDING REMEDIES WITHIN A MONTH OF THE RECALL, BUT THIS HAS GONE ON LONG ENOUGH.  THE RECALL WAS ISSUED IN JANUARY, I RECEIVED NOTICE IN MARCH, AND IT IS NOW MID-JULY, WITH NO REMEDY FORTHCOMING.  I AM FRUSTRATED THAT A SOLUTION HAS NOT YET BEEN PROVIDED AND SINCERELY HOPE THAT THIS ISSUE WILL BE DEALT WITH BEFORE THE MONTH IS OUT.  *TR",
