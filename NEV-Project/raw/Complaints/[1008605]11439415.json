The car stalled in the middle of an active intersection.   My make and model and manufacture year was involved in a recall for this exact problem but for unknown reasons my VIN is not included.   The car has been meticulously maintained and has less than 50,000 miles.  The check engine light appeared immediately prior to the car losing power.",
