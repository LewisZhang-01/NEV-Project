        "summary": "I PURCHASED A CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED CAR ON JAN. 2015. SINCE MID-2016 (ONE AND A HALF YEAR SINCE I OWNED THE CAR) I'VE BEEN NOTICING THAT MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT TURNED ON EVERY NOW AND THEN, AND GEAR SHIFTING BECAME SIGNIFICANTLY LAGGING AROUND 30MPH. EVERY SINGLE TIME IN A SERVICE APPOINTMENT (WHICH I TOOK STRICTLY ON SCHEDULE FOR EVERY 3 MONTHS), I WOULD POINT THAT OUT TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT, AND EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY WOULD CLAIM THAT THEY TESTED EVERYTHING AND THERE WAS NO PROBLEM THEY DETECTED.    WHILE LAST WEEK (LATE JUNE 2017, 2 AND A HALF YEARS SINCE I OWNED THE CAR, AND INTERESTINGLY 5 MONTHS AFTER ALL MY WARRANTY EXPIRED), I WAS TRYING TO DRIVE BACK HOME FROM OFFICE VIA THE HIGHWAY. WHILE ENTERING THE HIGHWAY AND SPEEDUP, I NOTICED THAT MY ENGINE SPEED WENT UPS AND DOWNS IN A SERIOUS, UNCOMMON, RAPID MANNER. THERE WAS ALSO AN UNPLEASANT NOISE COMING OUT OF THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM. MY CAR SERIOUSLY SHAKES, AND ALL GEAR SHIFTING ATTEMPTS BECAME USELESS. THE CAR WENT OUT OF CONTROL AND WENT TO NEUTRAL GEAR ON THE HIGHWAY--WHICH PUSHED ME TO A VERY DANGEROUS EMERGENCY SITUATION. FORTUNATELY I MADE IT STOPPED BY THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY AND MANAGED TO CALL THE ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE.    MY CAR WAS FINALLY TOWED TO THE CLOSEST CHEVY DEALERSHIP, AND UPON DIAGNOSTICS THEY REPLIED THAT TO REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION PART, IT WOULD COST ME $4100. IT WAS THE SAME AMOUNT FOR SELLING THE SAME MODEL WITH GOOD CONDITION !!!!     I READ EVERY COMPLAINTS FOR 2011 CHEVY CRUZE REGARDING THE TRANSMISSION PROBLEM, AND FOUND VERY SIMILAR EXPERIENCES FOR ALL THE CASES. IT ALL HAPPENED ON THE 2011 MODULE, TRANSMISSION SYSTEM GOT FAILED AROUND 50K~60K MILEAGE, AND THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO REPLACE THE WHOLE PART.",
