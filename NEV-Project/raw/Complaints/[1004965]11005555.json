THEY REPLACED THE IGNITION, AND SUPPOSEDLY REPLACED AIRBAGS ALSO. THE IGNITION ALLOWED THE CAR TO THEN RESTART. HOWEVER WHEN I WENT TO PICK THE CAR UP IT RAN REALLY BADLY, AND HAD ALL THE WARNING LIGHTS IN THE DASH ON. I CONFRONTED THE DEALERSHIP ABOUT THIS BEFORE EVEN LEAVING THE LOT. THEY TOLD ME I WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE IT LOOKED AT. I TOWED IT TO A DIFFERENT DEALERSHIP WHERE THEY FOUND THE MAIN WIRING HARNESS PULLED APART UNDER THE DASH. AFTER I PICKED THE CAR UP FROM THEM I'VE HAD THE WORST ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS IMAGINABLE. I'VE BEEN STRANDED IN ELLENSBURG WA FOR 3 MONTHS, THE BATTERY DIED EVERY 3-4 WEEKS. FCA WILL NOT EVEN RETURN ANY OF MY CALLS, AND THE DEALERSHIP JUST TRIED TO SELL ME A NEW CAR WHEN I CONTACT THEM. PLEASE HELP",
