I have taken it back the dealer after the first incident to have it repaired ($291.00) worth and it done it twice since then, less than 3 weeks after repairs. I\u2019m out of town now so I hope I can get it home for it to go back to the dealer for more repairs. I don\u2019t agree with Ford motor co. Decision not to recall all the trucks with this issue. I will not buy another Ford truck unless I know for sure this is resolved.",
