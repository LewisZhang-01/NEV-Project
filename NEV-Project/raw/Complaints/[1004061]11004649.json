NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU ARE DOING 25 MPH. VERY DANGEROUS AND WORRISOME.  LET'S HOPE NOTHING EVER HAPPENS TO ANY MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY WHILE THIS CONDITION PRESENTS ITSELF. NISSAN NEEDS TO STEP UP AND BE ACCOUNTABLE.  IT HAPPENED AGAIN TODAY WHILE DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE.  THE TERRAIN WAS A GRADE GOING UPHILL, TEMPERATURE AROUND 92 IN TEXAS.",
