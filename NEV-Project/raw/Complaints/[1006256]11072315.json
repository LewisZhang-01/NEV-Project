        "summary": "TIPM, I HAVE HAD TONS OF PROBLEMS WITH MY VAN SINCE I PURCHASED. THERE IS NO TELLING HOW MUCH I HAVE SPENT OF THE YEARS ON REPAIRS. COME TO FIND OUT MOST OF MY REPAIRS WERE NOT NECESSARY. THEY ALL CAME FROM THE FAULTY TIPM.  I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED. THE ISSUE IT CAUSES IS UNBELIEVABLE. THE STRESS AND INCONVENIENCE THIS HAS CAUSED ME AND MY FAMILY IS MORE THAN I COULD EVER IMAGINE. I'M OUT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON REPAIR BILLS AND NOW I FIND OUT THAT IT WILL BE ANOTHER $1,300 TO FIX THIS. I HAVE BEEN HAVING ISSUES FOR YEARS!!! WHEN I WOULD TAKE IT IN THEY WOULD TREAT THE SYMPTOMS NOT THE PROBLEM WHICH I'M JUST FINDING OUT IS THE TIPM. IF THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN PROPERLY DIAGNOSED WHILE UNDER WARRANTY THAN NO BIG DEAL, BUT OF COURSE IT WAS NOT. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN BY BRAKES DON'T WORK, I TURN ON THE VAN START TO DRIVE AND IT WON'T SHIFT I HAVE TO PULL OVER AND TURN OFF THE VAN THEN RESTART IT. SOMETIMES IT WONT START JUST SITS THERE LIKE IT WANTS TO START. THE FUEL PUMP IS NOW CONSTANTLY RUNNING. I'M SURE THAT'S NOT SAFE AT ALL. THE ENGINE HOURS ARE TWICE WHAT THE MILEAGE SAYS IT SHOULD BE. HUM GUESS THAT'S CAUSE MY ENGINE IS RUNNING ALL THE TIME. THAT WOULD BE BECAUSE THE TIPM IS FLAWED.",
