I WAS TOLD IT IS A RECALL, I CALLED THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT TO FIX IT, I WAS TREATED WITH ABSOLUTE DISRESPECT AND WAS TOLD MY CAR WAS ALREADY FIXED THROUGH THE WARRANTY, I ASSURED THEM I WAS THE ONLY OWNER AND IT WAS NEVER FIXED, THEY AGAIN TOLD ME IT WAS AND THEY WOULD NOT PAY FOR IT TO GET FIXED AGAIN EVEN IF IT IS THE SAME ISSUE THAT THE RECALL WAS FOR. I HAVE HAD THE GAS OVERFLOW AND SPRAY ALL OVER ME MULTIPLE TIMES, INCLUDING ONE TIME WHILE I WAS HOLDING MY INFANT CHILD. THIS IS NOT OK AND SO BEYOND UNSAFE!!! IT CLEARLY WASN'T FIXED AND I WOULD LIKE IT FIXED BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT! THE VEHICLE WAS OFF AND PARKED. I ALSO KNOW MULTIPLE PEOPLE WITH THIS SAME MODEL AND THEIRS DO THE SAME THING AND ALL HAVE RUST EATING THROUGH THEIR VEHICLES ON THE PANEL UNDER THEIR GAS TANKS, WAS FIXING THAT ALSO IN THE RECALL SINCE IT IS CLEARLY DUE TO THE GAS OVERFLOWING?",
