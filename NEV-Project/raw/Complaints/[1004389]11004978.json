SHE WAS BARELY ABLE TO GET IT OFF THE ROAD, AS WELL AS RETURN THE VEHICLE HOME. THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS! THE ONLY WARNING LIGHT THAT TURNED ON WAS THE SERVICE POWER STEERING MESSAGE AND THE SERVICE ADVANCETRAK MESSAGE. I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO MY MECHANIC THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE TROUBLE CODES, AND CLEARED THEM. THE DROVE THE VEHICLE ABOUT 15 MILES AND WERE NOT ABLE TO REPLICATE THE PROBLEM. WE PICKED UP THE VEHICLE 7/11/17 AND DROVE 15 MILES HOME AND LEFT FOR THE NIGHT. 7/12/15 THE MORNING OF, MY WIFE PROCEEDED TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE 3 MILES AND SURE ENOUGH SAME PROBLEM HAPPENED TO HER WHILE DRIVING. FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CANNOT UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE. WHY IS THERE A RECALL FOR THE 2011 VEHICLES BUT NOT FOR 2010, WHICH FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IS WHAT SPARKED THE ENTIRE RECALL PERIOD. FORD NEEDS TO REMEDY THIS ISSUE, OR PROVIDE A FIX FOR THE VEHICLE.",
