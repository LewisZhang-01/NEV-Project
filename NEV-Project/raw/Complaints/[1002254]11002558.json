I HAD TO REMOVE MY FEET FROM THE HIGHWAY PEGS QUICKLY TO HIT THE BACK BRAKE PEDAL TO KEEP FROM HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME. MY OWNERS MANUAL STATES THAT IF ABS GOES OUT ON BIKE THAT THE BRAKES WILL CONTINUE TO WORK BUT WILL NOT BE ABS. MY FRONT BRAKE HAND LEVER WILL NOT PULL IN TO ENGAGE THE FRONT BRAKE AND I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP THAT I NEEDED A NEW ABS/HCU MODULE. IF I UNDERSTAND THIS CORRECTLY THEN THIS PART IS PART OF THE ABS SYSTEM AND IT HAS FAILED AND NOW I DO NOT HAVE BRAKES ON THE FRONT OF MY MOTORCYCLE BECAUSE THE FAILURE OF THE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT MAKE MY BRAKE LEVER USELESS. I WAS TOLD BY ME DEALERSHIP THAT THIS IS A COMMON FAILURE FOR HD BIKES WITH ABS BRAKES BUT HARLEY WILL NOT RECALL THEM.",
