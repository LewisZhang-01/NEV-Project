        "summary": "ON NOVEMBER 14, 2020, MY 2007 TOYOTA PRIUS HAD A LOSS OF STEERING THE STEERING WHEEL WAS NO LONGER CONNECTED TO THE FRONT WHEELS OF THE CAR.  PARKING ON A CITY STREET  ATLANTIC TOYOTA DID NOT PERFORM THE RECALL ON MARCH 12,2013 FOR THE COT RECALL THIS IS WHAT CAUSED THE LOSS OF STEERING.  THE CAR WAS REPAIRED AT A PRIVATE GARAGE FOR THE LOSS OF STEERING AND THE PART THAT FAILED WAS THE STEERING INTERMEDIATE EXTENSION SHAFT THE PART THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN REPLACED UNDER THE COT RECALL DONE AT ATLANTIC TOYOTA.  (THE SHAFT REPLACEMENT DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE BOLT HOLE HAS A 'COUNTERSINK', ACCORDING TO THE TECHNICAL INSTRUCTIONS ISSUED TO DEALERS, T-CP-C0T-A510-D. THE SHAFT THAT WAS REMOVED AND, IN MY POSSESSION, HAS A COUNTERSINK).  HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN TOYOTA IDENTIFIED A DEFECTIVE PART AND ISSUED A RECALL I BROUGHT MY CAR TO A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND THE WORK WAS NOT DONE.   WITH THE LOSS OF STEERING THERE IS A CONCERN ABOUT SAFETY AND CONFIDENCE IN THE VEHICLE, AND NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT.   I AM SENDING THIS EMAIL TODAY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING HAS GONE TERRIBLY WRONG.   THE SYSTEM MEANT TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST FAULTY VEHICLES HAS FAILED, AND IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.",
