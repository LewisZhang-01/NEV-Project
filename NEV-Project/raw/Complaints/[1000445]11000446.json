        "summary": "ON SATURDAY, JUNE 17, 2017, MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER VOMITED IN HER CAR SEAT, A GRACO MYSIZE 65. WHEN THE COVER WAS REMOVED TO WASH, THE POLYURETHANE FOAM HEADREST (WHICH STATES IN BOLD LETTERS DO NOT REMOVE) WAS FOUND TO BE DETACHED. WHEN THE CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT OPENED LATER THAT WEEK, I CALLED GRACO, WHERE THE REPRESENTATIVE TOLD ME THAT MY SEAT IS NO LONGER SAFE TO USE, THAT THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE, AND THAT THE ENGINEERS ARE WORKING ON A SOLUTION. I ALSO INFORMED HER THAT THE SEAT BEING DISCUSSED IS A REPLACEMENT SEAT, AS THE ORIGINALLY PURCHASED SEAT HAD TO BE REPLACED DUE TO A BROKEN HARNESS RESTRAINT LEVER AND ADJUSTMENT STRAP APPARATUS. SHE THEN OFFERED TO SEND ME ANOTHER REPLACEMENT SEAT. I ASKED IF THE NEW SEAT WOULD BE THE SAME MODEL AS THE SEAT I WAS CURRENTLY HAVING PROBLEMS WITH, AND SHE SAID YES. I ASKED HOW I COULD BE SURE THAT THE NEW SEAT WOULD BE SAFE, AS WE DID NOT KNOW THAT OURS WAS BROKEN UNTIL THE COVER WAS REMOVED. SHE STATED AGAIN THAT THE ENGINEERS ARE WORKING ON A SOLUTION, BUT THE SEATS WOULD BE THE SAME. WHEN I TOLD HER THAT I WAS HESITANT TO GET THE SAME MODEL DUE TO POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUES, SHE OFFERED ME A FULL REFUND; ALL I HAD TO DO WAS SHIP THE OLD SEAT BACK (GRACO WOULD PROVIDE A SHIPPING LABEL BUT NOT A BOX) WITH SOME OTHER INFORMATION IF THE DEFECT WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE FAULT OF THE MANUFACTURER AFTER EXAMINATION OF THE SEAT AND INFORMATION, A CHECK WOULD BE ISSUED IN 10-14 DAYS.   THE NEXT DAY, I CALLED GRACOS CUSTOMER SERVICE BACK; BECAUSE AFTER INSPECTION OF MY OLDEST DAUGHTERS CAR SEAT  (A GRACO MYSIZE 65 WITH DIFFERENT MODEL NUMBER AND DATE), THE SAME PROBLEM WAS DISCOVERED. I SPOKE TO A DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIVE AND WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE THE CAR SEAT WAS OVER 1 YEAR OLD, A PARTIAL REFUND WOULD BE GIVEN ,EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS A KNOWN DEFECT PRESENT IN NEWER MODELS STILL UNDER WARRANTY.",
