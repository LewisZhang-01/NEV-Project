        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS (70+ MPH) ON A MOUNTAIN ROAD GOING UPHILL IN HEAVY TRAFFIC WHEN THE TRUCK COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN. THE TRUCKS' POWER STEERING, BRAKING, AND MANEUVERABILITY BECAME EXTREMELY CHALLENGING AS I TRIED TO PULL IT TO SAFETY. HOWEVER, WITH IT BEING ON A MOUNTAIN ROAD THERE WAS VERY LITTLE SHOULDER AND PART OF MY TRUCK ENDED UP BLOCKING TRAFFIC SINCE THE TRUCK WAS UNRESPONSIVE. MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD! THE FAULTY COMPONENT THAT CAUSED THIS SITUATION IS THE FUEL PUMP FUSE OVERHEATED CAUSING NO FUEL DELIVERY TO MY VEHICLE. I LATER LEARNED THROUGH SOME RESEARCH THAT FORD MOTOR CO. HAD ISSUED, WITHOUT ALERTING THE PUBLIC, A TSB (15-0137) REGARDING THE FUEL PUMP FUSE. I HAD NO IDEA SINCE THERE WAS NO RECALL ISSUED. IF I HAD KNOWN, THIS VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED!!!",
