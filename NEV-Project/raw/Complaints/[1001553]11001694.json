HTTPS://YOUTU.BE/DFYWAGVKAVU  THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THESE WERE KNOWN ISSUES BUT NO RECALLS HAVE BEEN ISSUED. THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY AT TIME OF ISSUE. I MAY NEED TO HAVE THE DEALERSHIP RE PRINT MY INVOICE, I DIDN'T SEE IT IN MY FILES. MY VEHICLE IS A 2013 AND THIS ISSUE WAS IN 2016. WIRES SHOULD NOT BE CORRODED THIS QUICKLY, MY WARRENTY DID NOT COVER THE WIRES. THIS ISSUE SEEMS DANGEROUS TO ME.",
