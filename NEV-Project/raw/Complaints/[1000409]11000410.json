BOTH TIMES I WAS INFORMED THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A CALL WHEN THE PARTS CAME IN BUT THE CALL NEVER CAME AND THE REPAIR NEVER DONE. YESTERDAY I WENT BEYOND THE DEALERSHIP AND SPOKE TO A GM REPRESENTATIVE WHO ALSO COULDN'T FIND ANY DEALERSHIP IN MY AREA WITH THE PARTS TO COMPLETE THE WORK. OF COURSE AT THIS POINT I ASKED FOR A \"LOANER\" CAR SINCE I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SAFELY PUT A PASSENGER IN THE FRONT SEAT FOR ELEVEN MONTHS!  NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT REQUEST FELL ON DEAF EARS.  IRONICALLY, AFTER ALL THAT, LAST NIGHT THE CAR WAS \"TOTALED\" AND I AM GRATEFUL THAT THE AIRBAG WAS NOT INVOLVED IN ANY INJURIES. MY MAIN POINT IN NOTIFYING YOU TODAY IS TO SAY THAT THIS HAS BEEN A SORRY EXCUSE FOR A RECALL. NO COMPANY SHOULD TAKE ELEVEN MONTHS AND STILL NOT BE ABLE TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM. NO COMPANY SHOULD DENY ME THE RIGHT TO USE THE PASSENGER SEAT OF MY VEHICLE AND NOT FACE CONSEQUENCES. YOU ALL NEED TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND TRULY PROTECT THE CONSUMER.",
