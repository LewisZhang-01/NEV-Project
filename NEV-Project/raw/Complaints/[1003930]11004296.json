OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE WAS 66F, I WAS NOT DRIVING UNDER A BRIDGE AND I DIDN'T HEAR ANY NOISE OF IMPACT GENERATED BY A FOREIGN OBJECT. AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION I WAS PASSING A TRUCK AND BY THE SOUND OF IT, I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT THAT ONE OF THE TRUCK'S TIRES EXPLODED. INSTEAD I LOOKED UP AND MY ENTIRE PANORAMIC SUNROOF WAS IN PIECES. LUCKILY THE SUNSHADE LINING WAS CLOSED AND IT PROTECTED MY FACE FROM BEING EXPOSED TO THE PIECES OF BROKEN GLASS.",
