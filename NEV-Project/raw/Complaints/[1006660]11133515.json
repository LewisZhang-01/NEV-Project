MANY OTHER OWNERS OF THESE CARS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. THE LOW BEAM HEAD LIGHT IS WAY TO DIM AND NOT MUCH BRIGHTER THE THE DAY TIME DRIVING LIGHTS. WHEN COMPARING THIS MODEL CAR TO OTHERS SIDE BY SIDE ON LOW BEAM THIS MODEL IS LESS THAN HALF AS BRIGHT AS THE OTHER MODELS ON LOW BEAMS. CADILLAC AND THE LOCAL DEALER SAY NOTHING CAN BE DONE FOR IMPROVEMENT. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.",
