        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING ON INTERSTATE 40 IN ALBUQUERQUE,NM, AT THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT OF 65 MPH, THE TRUCK HIT A DIAGONAL TRANSITION FROM ASPHALT TO CEMENT ON AN OVERPASS. THE SLIGHT SHIFT IN STEERING FEEDBACK CAUSED BY THE \"BUMP\" INSTANTLY STARTED AN UNCONTROLLABLE OSCILLATION IN THE FRONT END NEARLY CAUSING ME TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE. THE ONLY WAY TO STOP THE OSCILLATION WAS A SUDDEN DECELERATION WHICH THEN NEARLY CAUSED A COLLISION WITH THE VEHICLES FOLLOWING.  THIS IS A RECURRING PROBLEM WITH THESE TRUCKS AND KNOWN TO THE OEM.  AT APPROX. 24000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE, I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER FOR THE SAME REASON AND THE STEERING DAMPNER WAS REPLACED UNDER WARRANTY. THIS LATEST EVENT OCCURRED AT  APPROX. 29,000 MILES ON THE ODOMETER.  EVEN THE EMPLOYEES AT THE FORD DEALER KNEW THE PHENOMENON AS THE \"DEATH WOBBLE\".  PLEASE TAKE ACTION TO GET THIS MATTER RESOLVED AS I BELIEVE IT TO BE A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONCERN.",
