I VISITED THE DEALER TWO WEEKS APART AND  SAT AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR MORE THAN 5 HOURS WITH THE SECOND VISIT BEING FOR 8 HOURS. I WAS TOLD SOMETHING WAS LEAKING IN STEERING AND THAT HAD TL BE FIXED. I LEFT WITH MY CAR AND APPROXIMATELY 8 DAYS LATER THERE WAS A CLICKING AND CLANKING AOUND COMING FROM THE ENGINE, IVE NEVER HEARD THE SOUND, YET ON MY PAPERWORK IT STATED I COMPLAINED ABOUT THE SOUND, WHICH I NEVER DID. MY CAR STARTED TO STALL AND LOSE SPEED. I WAS OVER 100 MILES FROM HOME AND MY CAR WAS FAILING IN THE MOUNTAINS AT THAT. I CALLED THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT MULTIPLE TIMES AND NEVER RECEIVED A CALL BACK. THANK GOD FOR MY INSURANCE TOWING THE CAR TO THE CLOSEST DEALERSHIP. A DAY AND HALF LATER I WAS TOLD THE ENGINE WAS GONE! I VISITED THE DEALERSHIP ON 07/31/20 & 08/14/20... THEY DOCUMENTED A RATTLING RATTLING SOUND IN THE FRONT IN... NEVER ADDRESSED ME ABOUT THIS 'SOUND' , DID A SO CALL INSPECTION OF THE CAR AND NEXT THING I AM TOLD IS I CANT DRIVE IT BECAUSE THE ENGINE COULD BLOW. NO RETURN FROM HYUNDAI SERVICE MANAGER, NO CLAIM FILED AND I AM STILL OUT OF STATE WITHOUT AN ANSWER. CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE SAT ONLINE 30 MINS WAITING FOR A REP BEFORE THEIR LINE DISCONNECTED AND THEM ANOTHER HOUR. FILED A CASE AND NOW STILL STUCK WAITING FOR THESE PEOPLE TO DO THEIR JOB WITH OUT PUTTING MY LIFE AT RISK.",
