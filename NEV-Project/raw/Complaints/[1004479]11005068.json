        "summary": "THE SENSORS FOR BRAKING DID NOT WORK. I HAD AN ACCIDENT WHERE I REAR ENDED A TRUCK.  THE BRAKES DIDN'T WORK, ONLY SLID INTO THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. I WAS ON A BUSY STREET WHEN AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE TURNED ON SIRENS AT THE LAST  SECOND.  THE TRUCK STOPPED AS IT SHOULD HAVE. I BRAKED AS HARD AS POSSIBLE BUT THE CAR KEPT GOING UNTIL IT COLLIDED INTO THE TRUCK.  I HAVE READ REPORTS ON THE 2017 SONATA WHICH STATES THE CAR WILL STOP WHEN IT SENSES IMMINENT DANGER. THIS ONE DIDN'T. MY CONCERN IS- IS THERE MORE CARS LIKE THIS ONE OUT THERE THAT DON'T WORK AS IT SHOULD.  I PURCHASED THIS CAR 02/2017. HAD ONLY 23 MILES. I TOOK MY CAR IN FOR SERVICING THE DAY BEFORE AND WAS TOLD THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE CAR.  I NEVER RECEIVED A NOTICE OF RECALL AND STILL HAVEN'T.  SUPOSSEDLY THAT WAS TAKEN CARE OF. THE INVOICE SHOWS THE RECALL WAS FOR ALTN SCREW. IT SHOWS IT WAS FOR SANTA FE SPT/SONATA.",
