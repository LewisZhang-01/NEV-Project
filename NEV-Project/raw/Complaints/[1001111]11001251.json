IT WAS A DEFINITE HAZARD TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE DRIVING BEHIND ME AND THEY HAD TO QUICKLY SWITCH LANES SO AS TO AVOID IT. NO THERE IS NOTHING BUT INTERIOR CARPET BETWEEN THE PASSENGER'S FEET AND THE ROAD BELOW THEM. IT APPEARS VERY DANGEROUS TO HAVE A HOLE RUSTED OUT RIGHT THERE. THE CAR HAS ALWAYS BEEN PARKED ON A DRIVEWAY AND WASHED AFTER EVERY SNOW/SALTING OF THE ROADS. THERE IS VERY MINIMAL RUST ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE CAR, LEADING ME TO BELIEVE THERE WAS SOME SORT OF DEFECT IN THAT LOCATION.",
