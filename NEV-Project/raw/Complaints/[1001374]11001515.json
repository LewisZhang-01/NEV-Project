I HAD IT DIAGNOSED BY A TRANSMISSION SHOP AND THEY SAID THAT THE RADIATOR WAS LEAKING WATER AND COOLANT IN TO MY TRANSMISSION AND IT WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED. I THEN HAD MY VEHICLE TOWED TO THE NISSAN DEALER WHERE THE TECHNICIAN SAID THAT THIS IS CAUSED BY A FAULTY HOSE ON RADIATOR AND IT WAS HAPPENING TO A LOT OF FRONTIERS AND XTERRAS. WHEN MY HUSBAND QUESTIONED THE TECH ON THIS BEING A RECALL HE STATED THAT IT SHOULD BE, BUT IS NOT BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CAUSE A SAFETY ISSUE. HE TOLD US WE WOULD NEED A NEW RADIATOR, HOSES, AND TRANSMISSION. THE TRUCK BREAKING DOWN IS A SAFETY ISSUE!  WE THEN HAD OUR TRUCK TOWED TO OUR NORMAL MECHANIC AND HE IS REPAIRING IT NOW.",
