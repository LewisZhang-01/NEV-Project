        "summary": "EXHAUST IN CABIN WHEN INSIDE AIR IS ENGAGED, YOUR OWN EXHAUST!  HAPPENS WHEN VEHICLE IS ACCELERATED AND THEN AS YOU LEVEL THE SPEED OUT, THE EXHAUST FILLS THE VEHICLE.  THIS CONSISTENTLY HAPPENS ON CITY STREETS, HIGHWAY, TURNING CORNERS, ETC. WE HAVE MONITORED THE CARBON MONOXIDE AND IT REGISTERS ON DETECTOR.  THIS IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY ISSUE    THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE IN EXHAUST SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD BE A CLOSED SYSTEM SO THAT THERE IS NO WAY THE TOXIC SMELL SHOULD COME INSIDE YOUR CAR.    OUR FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PROBLEM WAS WHEN WE INITIALLY BOUGHT A 2015 FORD EXPLORER, SAME PROBLEM.  FORD WORKED ON THE 2015 MANY MANY TIMES AND FINALLY SAID THEY WOULD NOT AUTHORIZE ANYMORE WORK ON THE VEHICLE.  AT WHICH TIME FORD BOUGHT THE 2015 FORD EXPLORER BACK.  AND SOLD US THE 2017 TO TAKE ITS PLACE.    WE BEGAN HAVING THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE 2017 FORD EXPLORER AND IT HAS ALSO BEEN IN THE SHOP ABOUT 3 TIMES, NOW FORD HAS GIVEN IT BACK TO US AND TOLD US THEY WILL NOT AUTHORIZE ANY WORK ON IT.  PROBLEM NOT SOLVED BUT IT IS A REALITY FOR US    WE ARE STILL PAYING NOTES ON A VEHICLE THAT IS TOTALLY UNSAFE FOR US AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN.       ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SEEN THIS PROBLEM ON THE NATIONAL NEWS, FOUND IT ON THE INTERNET ( PROBLEM SINCE 2011) NONE OF THIS WAS DISCLOSED TO US WITH THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE OF THE 2015!   FORD KNOWS ABOUT THIS PROBLEM YET JUST WALKS AWAY WITH NO INTENTION OF FIXING IT OR OWNING THE PROBLEM.",
