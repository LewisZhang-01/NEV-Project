SIMILAR TRUCKS IN TOYOTA'S PRODUCT LINE QUALIFIED FOR FRAME REPLACEMENT BUT THE 4RUNNER WAS IGNORED. THE REST OF THE TRUCK IS 100% RUST FREE EXCEPT FOR THE FRAME.    RECENTLY HAD A BODY SHOP LOOK AT THE FRAME - WAS DESCRIBED AS \"TOO RUSTY TO WELD ONTO\" WHEN DISCUSSING PATCHES.    BELOW I AM ASKED FOR A DATE WHEN THIS EVENT HAPPENED. I AM PUTTING TODAYS DATE, 2003 BECAUSE LOGICALLY THE TRUCK HAS BEEN RUSTING SINCE IT WAS BUILT.",
