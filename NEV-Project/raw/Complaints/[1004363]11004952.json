I WAS IN A 2013 CHEVROLET MALIBU LS TRAVELLING AT APPROXIMATELY 15MPH, THE OTHER DRIVER IN A 2010 HONDA ACCORD TRAVELLING AT APPROXIMATELY 45-55MPH. THE COLLISION WAS BETWEEN MY FRONT LEFT AND HIS FRONT RIGHT, NO PASSENGERS. NO AIR BAGS DEPLOYED FROM EITHER VEHICLE, AND AS MINE DID NOT DEPLOY, I RECEIVED A CONCUSSION WHEN THE BACK OF MY HEAD BROKE THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW. I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS PART OF TAKATA, AS I CANNOT FIND THE MANUFACTURER OF MY CAR'S AIRBAGS. CHEVROLET PROVIDED NO INFORMATION AS TO THE MANUFACTURER OR WHY AT LEAST THE CURTAIN AIRBAG WOULD NOT HAVE DEPLOYED TO PREVENT CONCUSSION.",
