THE DEALERSHIP WAS ABLE TO DUPLICATE THE CONCERN ONCE BUT IT IS NOT BAD ENOUGH TO REPAIR.  CONCERN #2:  WHILE COMING TO A SLOW ROLLING STOP (AS IF COMING TO A KNOWN STOP SIGN) THERE IS A HARD BANG/CLUNK JUST BEFORE GETTING TO A COMPLETE STOP, IT FEELS LIKE YOU ARE BEING HIT IN THE REAR BY ANOTHER CAR.  AS YOU SLOWLY ACCELERATE IT BANGS/CLUNKS AGAIN HARD.  THE BANG CAN BE FELT AND HEARD, AND ONLY HAPPENS ON SLOW STOPS, NOT WHEN YOU HAVE TO STOP QUICKLY. THE VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY AT THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE THIRD TIME REGARDING THIS SAME CONCERN.  THE DEALERSHIP REPROGRAMMED THE TRANSMISSION AND A TRANSMISSION VALVE BODY WAS REPLACED BUT IT HAS NOT FIXED THE CONCERN.  THIS BANG IS SO BAD THAT IT IS HARD THAT I FEAR DRIVING IT IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC.",
