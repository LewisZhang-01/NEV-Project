        "summary": "\"TONGUE WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION\". I FILLED THE WATER TANK, LOADED THE STORAGE AREA AND PROCEEDED TO DRIVE THE R-POD. AT 50 MPH THE TRAILER BEGAN TO FISHTAIL. MY TRUCK AND TRAILER ALTERNATED ON 2 WHEELS. I DID GET CONTROL, HAD TO TRAVEL HOME AT UNDER 35 MPH. I GOT HOME AND WAS ABLE TO LIFT THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER. ALL OF THE STORAGE AND WATER TANK ARE BEHIND THE SINGLE AXLE. THERE IS NO STORAGE AVAILABLE IN THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER TO DISTRIBUTE THE WEIGHT. THE DINING AREA IS IN THE FRONT. THE PASS-THRU STORAGE IS BEHIND THE AXLE. THERE IS NO WAY FOR ME TO ADDRESS THIS DESIGN FLAW. I CANNOT ADD HUNDREDS OF POUNDS TO THE FRONT OF THE TRAILER WHERE THERE IS NO STORAGE SPACE AVAILABLE. I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THE TRAILER AND AFRAID TO SELL IT TO ANYONE ELSE. I RESEARCHED ONLINE AND FOUND SEVERAL OTHER SIMILAR COMPLAINTS, SOME RESULTING IN ACCIDENTS, HITTING OTHER CARDS, HITTING THE GUARD RAIL, ETC. *JS",
