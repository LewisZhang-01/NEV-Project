THE ENGINE REMAINED RUNNING BUT THE STEERING WHEEL COULD NOT BE MOVED AT ALL. VERY SCARY EXPERIENCE, THE VEHICLE WAS ABLE TO BE BROUGHT TO A SAFE STOP AND HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE SERVICE WRITER ADVISED ME THAT THIS IN NOT AN UNCOMMON CONDITION AMONG FORD VEHICLES (CARS AND TRUCKS) WITH ELECTRIC POWER STEERING.",
