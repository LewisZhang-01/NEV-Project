I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE CENTER TO LEARN THAT A FAULTY PASSENGER SIDE SEAT SENSOR WAS THE CAUSE OF THE WARNING LIGHT (NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY AND NOT INCLUDED IN ANY APPLICABLE RECALL). HOWEVER, I LATER CONDUCTED RESEARCH ONLINE AND FOUND THAT SIMILAR 2015 CHRYSLER 200S HAVE BEEN RECALLED FOR THIS EXACT SAME ISSUE (APPARENTLY MY VIN NUMBER [XXX] WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL). THIS WARNING LIGHT CAME ON AT APPROXIMATELY 60,000 MILES AND NO PREVIOUS ISSUES WE'RE NOTICED WITH THE AIRBAG SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH THE LIGHT FIRST CAME ON INTERMITTENT... IT NOW REMAINS ON CONSTANTLY.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
