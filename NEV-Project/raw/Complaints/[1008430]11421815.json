The first time I was turning onto another street and nearly ran into the ditch.  Luckily the second time, I was leaving a parking lot. On both occasions, it was very very difficult to turn the truck with no power steering. Once I turned the truck off for a while to research the problem and restarted it, the problem went away. I am now afraid to drive my truck on a upcoming trip to the mountains.",
