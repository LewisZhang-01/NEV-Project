THEY SAID IT WAS A SENSOR COVERED UNDER WARRANTY. OK GOOD. WELL A FEW DAYS AFTER, THE PROBLEM HAPPENED AGAIN. THIS TIME THEY SAY IT'S BECAUSE THE OIL NEEDED TO BE CHANGED. THE HUD SHOWED OVER 50% OIL LIFE LEFT. THE SAME ISSUE HAPPENED AGAIN A FEW DAYS AGO. THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO RESOLVE AFTER AN OIL CHANGE. I'VE NOTICED THIS HAS HAPPENED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT STILL NO RECALLS. THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. WHEN THE ENGINE STALLS, YOU LOOSE POWER STEERING AND BRAKES. THIS CAN CAUSE A MAJOR ACCIDENT. LUCKILY, IT'S ONLY HAPPENED ON SURFACE STREETS. THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO AND FIXED.",
