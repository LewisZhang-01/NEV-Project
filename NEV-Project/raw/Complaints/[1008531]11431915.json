        "summary": "The contact owns a 2015 Nissan Altima. The contact received a recall notice for NHTSA Campaign Number: 20V315000 (Latches/Locks/Linkages) however, the part to do the recall repair was not yet available. The contact stated that the hood latch failed to open after multiple attempts. The contact then used a lubricant to unlatch the hood and was able to open the hood latch as needed. One day as the contact was driving approximately 25 MPH, the hood inadvertently opened without warning. The contact was able to pull over and assess the damage to his vehicle. The contact stated that the end of the hood closest to the windshield was bent towards the side which caused damage to both sides of the front quarter panels. Despite the damage, the contact was able to close the hood and drive the vehicle slowly back home. The dealer nor the manufacturer was notified of the failure. The vehicle was not repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 36,200.",
