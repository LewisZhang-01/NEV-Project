I HAVE TAKEN TO THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP I BOUGHT IT AT AND CALLED ANOTHER DEALERSHIP AND BOTH TOLD ME MY VIN ISN'T INCLUDED IN THE RECALL. NOW THE ESC LIGHT COMES ON FREQUENTLY. ON 7/11/17 MY RPM'S FLUCTUATED WHILE I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY AND IT SOUNDED HORRIBLE, IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S RACING (LIKE A MOTOR CYCLE) WHEN I GO ABOVE 30-40 MPH. A MECHANIC I KNOW SAID MY VIN SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE RECALL. ACCORDING TO EVERYTHING I HAVE READ THIS ISSUE FALLS THE RECALL.",
