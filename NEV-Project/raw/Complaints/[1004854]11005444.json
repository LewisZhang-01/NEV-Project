        "summary": "WE HAD STRUGGLED WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS ON THE CAR COMING ON AND GOING OFF RANDOMLY. HAD THE CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSOR REPLACED TWICE. RETURNED FROM A 11 DAY VACATION AND UPON STARTING THE CAR THERE WAS A KNOCKING SOUND FROM THE ENGINE. TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC IN TOWN IMMEDIATELY FOR FEAR SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE CAR. THE NEXT DAY RECEIVED A RECALL LETTER FROM KIA BUT THE MECHANIC IN TOWN HAD ALREADY RUN DIAGNOSTICS AND FOUND SEVERAL THINGS WRONG WITH THE ENGINE. TOOK IT TO KIA PER THE RECALL AND THEY REPORTED THAT THE DIAGNOSTIC TOOL COULD FIND NOTHING WRONG AND THAT THE ENGINE WAS FUN. I TOOK IT TO A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP FOR TRADE ASSESSMENT AND THEY TOO TOLD ME THE ENGINE WAS BAD. I HAVE SINCE TRADED THE CAR IN BECAUSE A MECHANIC I TRUST ADVISED ME TO DO SO.    WHEN THIS CAR WAS FIRST PURCHASED IT WAS INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT THAT WAS UNREPORTED AND REPAIRED BY THE DEALERSHIP. I'VE CONSTANT TROUBLE WITH THE WIRING AND HONESTY OF KIA. I NO LONGER OWN THE VEHICLE BUT I SUFFERED AN EXPENSE TO REPLACE IT BECAUSE KIA CLAIMED THIS VEHICLE WAS UNAFFECTED. I DID NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING IT ANY LONGER.",
