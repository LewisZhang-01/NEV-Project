I MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH LARRY MILLER FORD LINCOLN DRAPER, 11442 S LONEPEAKPARKWAY, DRAPER,UT 84020 ON 7/21/20. WHEN I TOOK THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY SAID THERE WAS NO CURRENT RECALL ON THISVEHICLE AND THAT THE PART #CL8Z*3F818*A TORQUE STEERING SENSOR WAS DEFECTIVE CAUSING THE POWER STEERING TO FAIL. THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY WAS QUICK TO REJECT REPAIR FOR RECALLS OR WARRANTIES AS IT IS A DIRECT EXPENSE TO FORD MOTOR COMPANY. THEY SAID MY RECOURSE WAS TO CONTACT FORD MOTOR COMPANY WHICH I DID AT THE DEALERSHIP. AFTER CONTACT FORD MOTOR THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO RECALL WOULD BE HONORED AS THE RECALL WAS ALREADY PERFORMED IN 2014 WITH THE PREVIOUS OWNER AND ONLY THE SOFTWARE WAS UPDATED.  THE ESTIMATE OF REPAIRS AT LARRY MILLER FORD LINCOLN DRAPER WAS $922.97, WHICH, AS A SINGLE WOMAN, I HAVE HAD TO HAVE A REPAIR SHOP REPLACE THE SENSOR. LASTLY, AS I AM DIFFICULT TO REACH DURING THE DAY SO PLEASE CONTACT MY FATHER [XXX] AT [XXX]. THANKS FOR YOUR HELP IN THIS MATTER.
