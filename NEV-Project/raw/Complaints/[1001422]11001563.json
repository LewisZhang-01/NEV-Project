        "summary": "EXTERNAL TRANSMISSION COOLER/RADIATOR ASSEMBLY LEAK HAS CAUSED THE TRANSMISSION ON MY VEHICLE TO BECOME INOPERABLE. THE MIXING OF THE VEHICLE COOLANT AND THE TRANSMISSION FLUID CAUSED THE TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE/TRANSMISSION BODY ASSEMBLY TO MALFUNCTION.  THUS THE VEHICLE REFUSES TO START AS THE TRANSMISSION WILL NOT OPERATE. I AM NOW REQUIRED TO REPLACE THE RADIATOR AND TRANSMISSION CONTROL MODULE AT MORE THAN $2K OUT OF POCKETPIN ADDITION TO TOWING AND RENTAL VEHICLE EXPENSES. THE VEHICLE RAN FINE AND NO SLIPPING WAS DETECTED PRIOR TO THE MALFUNCTION EVEN AFTER MULTIPLE TRANSMISSION FLUID CHANGES. THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED IN MY GARAGE REQUIRING A TOW TO A MECHANIC AFTER RUNNING WITHOUT ANY ISSUES THE PREVIOUS DAY. APPARENTLY THIS IS A WIDESPREAD ISSUE THAT NISSAN HAS KNOWN ABOUT FOR YEARS IN THE XTERRA, PATHFINDER, TITAN, AND ARMADA MODELS. NISSAN FAILED TO NOTIFY VEHICLE OWNERS OF STEPS TO AVOID COSTLY REPAIRS BY SIMPLY USING A DIFFERENT NONCORRSIVE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FLUID AND TO REPLACE THE FAULTY RADIATOR AND EXTERNAL TRANSMISSION COOLER ASSEMBLY. I AM NOW LEFT IN A GREATER UNDUE HARDSHIP THNKS TO NISSAN'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE REGARDING AN ALL TOO COMMON ISSUE THAT NISSAN FAILED TO ADDRESS WITH THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS AND DOCUMENTED EXAMPLES. THE EXTENSION OF THE WARRANTY DOES ADEQUATELY COVER VEHICLE OWNERS WHO ALL SEEM TO FALL VICTIM OUTSIDE OF THE WARRANTY COVERAGE PERIOD THAT NISSAN SPECIFICALLY INCREASED DUE TO THE FAULTY EQUIPMENT AND FLUIDS THAT NISSAN RECOMMENDED AND EVEN REQUIRED.",
