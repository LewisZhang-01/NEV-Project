        "summary": "THE TWO MOST SERIOUS DEFECTS ARE A CRACKED FRAME OVER THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL (ON THE PASSENGER SIDE) AND INOPERABLE FRONT BRAKES.  IT WAS DETERMINED BY THE MANUFACTURER'S AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTER THAT THE FRONT BRAKES HAVE NEVER WORKED BECAUSE OF A DESIGN FLAW.  PER THE MANUFACTURER'S SERVICE CENTER (ATEL BUS & TRUCK , BELTSVILLE MD) \"THE SLACK ADJUSTERS ARE TOUCHING THE KNUCKLE AND/OR TOP OF THE KING PIN WHEN APPLIED - TOUCHING KEEPS THE SLACK ADJUSTER FROM TRAVELING FAR ENOUGH TO APPLY THE BRAKE SHOES TO THE DRUM.   FOUND COBWEBS IN THE BRAKES (THEY HAVE NEVER TOUCHED THE DRUMS).\"  THE COACH ALSO HAS NUMEROUS OTHER ISSUES LIKELY RELATED TO INSTABILITY - VEHICLE LEANS TO THE RIGHT SIDE, EXCESSIVE SWAY IN THE FRONT SUSPENSION AND STEERING, FRONT SHOCKS OUT OF ALIGNMENT AND STEERING COLUMN NOISE.  THESE AND OTHER ISSUES ARE DETAILED IN FULL INSPECTION REPORTS FROM ATEL BUS & TRUCK; INSPECTIONS BY NATIONWIDE INSURANCE COMPANY; AND CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN OUR ATTORNEYS AND TIFFIN.  THESE ARE MANUFACTURER'S DEFECTS AND NOT THE RESULT OF A SPECIFIC INCIDENT.  THE COACH CURRENTLY HAS APPROXIMATELY 12,000 MILES ON THE ODOMETER MUCH OF WHICH HAS BEEN ACCUMULATED DURING SERVICE TRIPS TO TIFFIN.  IN ADDITION, THE COACH HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR USE LESS THAN HALF OF THE TIME WE'VE OWNED IT.  IT'S CURRENTLY SITTING AT ATEL BUS & TRUCK WHERE IT'S BEEN FOR OVER NINETEEN MONTHS.  WE WOULD BE PLEASED TO DISCUSS THESE AND OTHER ISSUES WITH ANYONE WILLING TO HEAR OUR STORY.  WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED BY ATEL BUS & TRUCK (TIFFIN'S AUTHORIZED SERVICE CENTER) THAT THIS VEHICLE IS NOT SAFE FOR TRAVEL.",
