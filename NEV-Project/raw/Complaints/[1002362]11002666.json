AS I WAS SLOWLY TURNING INTO A PARKING SPACE AND APPLYING MY BRAKES, MY 2008 HONDA DR-V ACCELERATED ON IT'S OWN, AT A SPEED SO FAST I COULD NOT STOP IT, EVEN THOUGH I WAS APPLYING THE BRAKES AS HARD AS I COULD.  THE CR-V TRAVELED ABOUT 20-25 FEET AND HIT A PILLAR OF THE BUILDING HEAD ON.  THE CR-V HIT THE PILLAR WITH SUCH FORCE THAT IT REBOUNDED BACK APPROXIMATELY 5 FEET FROM THE POINT OF IMPACT.  THE FRONT OF THE CAR WAS CRUSHED IN AND THE DRIVER'S AIR BAG INFLATED.  THE SUDDEN, UNEXPLAINED ACCELERATION OF THE CR-V ON IT'S OWN CAUSED THE DAMAGE TO THE FRONT END OF THE CAR.  MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKES THE ENTIRE TIME AND THE CR-V WOULD NOT STOP.",
