        "summary": "ENGINE LIGHT WILL COME ON AND WHEN I ATTEMPT TO ACCELERATE THE JEEP WILL NOT GO OVER 25 MPH.  I NEED TO PULL OVER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND TURN THE CAR OFF.  I MAY NEED TO DO THIS SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE IT WILL START TO DRIVE NORMALLY.  THE ENGINE LIGHT WILL REMAIN ON ANYWHERE FROM HOURS TO SEVERAL DAYS WHILE THE CAR DRIVES NORMALLY.  THERE IS NO PATTERN TO WHEN IT HAPPENS.  I HAVE TAKEN THE JEEP IN TO A DEALER.  OIL FILTER HOUSING REPLACED.  DID NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM - DROVE FINE FOR 4 DAYS.  CAN HAPPEN ANYWHERE  - PULLING OUT ONTO MAJOR HIGHWAY OR JUST DRIVING ON A COUNTRY ROAD. IT IS VERY DANGEROUS AND SCARY. IT IS BACK AT THE SHOP AGAIN.  EACH TIME I HAVE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR AND RENT A ANOTHER VEHICLE. IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR A  FOR QUITE AWHILE, BUT SINCE I NEED MY VEHICLE I HAVE LIVED WITH IT.  I WILL SOON BE TRANSPORTING 2 YOUNG CHILDREN TO CAMP EVERY DAY AND IT IS HAPPENING MORE OFTEN SO I HAD TO HAVE IT FIXED.  ALSO THE COST OF REPAIR  IS ALMOST $3000 SO FAR PLUS RENTING A VEHICLE AT $50/DAY.  I JUST PURCHASED THE VEHICLE 11/12/15. I PUT THE DATE AS 01/01/2016 SINCE IT HAS HAPPENED REGULARLY SINCE I GOT IT, BUT IT IS NOW HAPPENING EVERY FEW DAYS.",
