That bracket broke off and my gas tank and bracket were dragging until I pulled off of the road. Luckily the entire gas tank didn\u2019t fall out because if it would have, the tank would\u2019ve broke and caused a massive spill of gas, since the tank was full of fuel. There is no warning lamps for this, a weld shouldn\u2019t just break off, and I can\u2019t find any replacements to fix it or replace it at all.",
