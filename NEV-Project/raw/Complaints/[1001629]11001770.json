THERE ARE MANY TIMES THAT IT WILL BARELY MOVE WHEN VEHICLES BEHIND ME ARE COMING TOWARD ME. I HAVE TO REALLY STEP ON THE GAS TO GET MOVING, AND EVEN THEN IT USUALLY DOESN'T ACCELERATE FAST ENOUGH.  EVERY TIME I GET INTO MY CAR, I COULD GET REAR ENDED. THIS PROBLEM IS ONLY GETTING WORSE.   I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN 2013.",
