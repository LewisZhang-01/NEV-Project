        "summary": "THIS VEHICLE HAS A KEYLESS IGNITION SYSTEM. TWICE MY WIFE ACCIDENTALLY TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE, ONCE AT A STOP, THE OTHER TIME ON A FREEWAY AT 70 MPH. SHE WAS UNAWARE THE VEHICLE COULD BE STARTED IN NEUTRAL THINKING SHE NEEDED TO BE IN PARK.  THE VEHICLE CONTINUED COASTING ALLOWING HER TO MOVE TO THE SIDE OF THE FREEWAY. THERE SHE WAS ABLE TO PUT THE VEHICLE IN PARK, PRESS ON THE BRAKE AND RESTART THE CAR. SHE DID NOT REALIZE THE VEHICLE ENGINE WAS OFF UNTIL SHE.PRESSED ON THE GAS TO MAINTAIN SPEED. SHE PANICKED AND TURNED TO ME AS AN ENGINEER WITH 40 YEARS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY. I KEPT HER CALM AND INSTRUCTED HER WHAT TO DO. ONLY WHEN WE WERE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD DID WE DETERMINE SHE HAD ACCIDENTALLY TURNED OFF THE ENGINE WHEN TUNING THE RADIO. WITH NO WARNING OR INDICATION THE ENGINE WAS OFF THE RESULTS COULD HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC. HER COLLEAGUE AT WORK ALSO DID THIS IN HIS LEXUS.  THE PROXIMITY OF THE START\\STOP BUTTON TO OTHER SIMILAR CONTROLS APPEARS TO BE A FACTOR IN THESE INCIDENTS. NO WARNING FROM THE VEHICLE NOT NOTICE FROM THE MANUFACTURER OF THE SALES DEALERSHIP OF THIS POSSIBILITY AND WHAT TO DO DOES NOT PREPARE THE DRIVER FOR WHEN THIS OCCU.",
