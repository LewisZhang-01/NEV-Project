THE NEXT DAY WHILE DRIVING I NOTICED A CRACK IN MY WINDSHIELD, NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE ROCK CHIP,  STARTING ON THE LEFT BOTTOM OF THE WINDSHIELD AND CURVING UP TO THE RIGHT FOR ABOUT 6\". THIS CRACK KEPT PROGRESSING DAILY AND NOW EXTENDS APPROX. 3/4 OF THE WAY ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD. THE WINDSHIELD FOR MY CAR IS ON NATIONAL BACKORDER WITHOUT ANY IDEA AS TO HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO GET IT IN.I WENT ONLINE AND IT APPEARS FROM THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE DISCUSSING IT,  IT APPEARS TO BE WIDESPREAD AND PROBABLY THE REASON FOR THE BACK ORDER. WITH THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS I'VE BREADTHS SHOULD BE A RECALL. AS A SIDE NOTE WHENEVER MY CAR'S VIN # IS RUN IT COMES UP AS A 2016 TOYOTA PRIUS C NOT A 2016 PRIUS FOUR TOURING. THE TECH AT THE AUTO GLASS SHOP TOLD ME THAT THIS HAS BEEN A RECURRING PROBLEM.",
