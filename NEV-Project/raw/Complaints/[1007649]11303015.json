IT WAS PURCHASED WITH  LOWER MILEAGE, OF AN ESTIMATION OF 40,000 TO 50,000 MILES ON IT AT FINAL SALE  MEANING IT WAS A 2007 CAR, PURCHASED IN 2011, SO THAT'S A PROBLEM WHEN BEFORE IT HAD BEEN PAID OFF, AND MAJOR PROBLEMS OF MANY. I WOULD LIKE A REFUND OF A LESSER EQUAL TO OR EQUAL VALUE TO MY PURCHASED CAR PRICE FROM MANUFACTURE OR DEALERSHIP. THE TWO RECALLS ISSUED THAT I HAVE NOT TAKEN CARE OF YET, AND OTHER PROBLEMS WITH CHEAP MADE INSIDE DOOR HANDLES BROKE EASILY, BEING HARD PLASTIC/METAL, THIS MAKES GETTING OUT OF MY VEHICLE A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUES ALONG WITH THE OTHER ISSUES OF AIRBAGS AND BRAKES AND OTHER SAFETY ISSUES.",
