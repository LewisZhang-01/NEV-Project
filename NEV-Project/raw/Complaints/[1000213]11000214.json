THIS TIME WE WERE ENTERING THE INTERSTATE GOING ABOUT 50 MPH AND THE WOBBLE AGAIN BEGAN AND AS I TRIED TO SLOW DOWN, PULL OVER AND STOP. I NOTICED IN THE BACK VIEW CAMERA THAT SOMETHING WAS VERY WRONG. THE EQUINOX WAS OFF TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND AS I ATTEMPTED TO SLOW DOWN THE LEFT (DRIVERS) FRONT SIDE OF OF THE EQUINOX HIT THE RIGHT (PASSENGER) SIDE OF THE MH CAUSING CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO BOTH VEHICLES. FORTUNATELY THERE WERE NO OTHER VEHICLES ON EITHER SIDE OF ME OR THE EQUINOX WOULD HAVE COLLIDED WITH THEM. AFTER PULLING OFF THE HIGHWAY AND MAKING A COMPLETE STOP, I LOOKED TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND DISCOVERED THAT THIS WOBBLE HAD BROKEN THE 7000 LB HITCH RECEIVER COMPLETELY FROM ITS MOUNTING ON THE MH AND DAMAGED BOTH THE TOW BAR AND THE SAFETY CABLES. THE SAFETY CABLES HAD KEPT THIS INCIDENT FROM BEING MUCH MORE SERIOUS THAN IT WAS AND POSSIBLY CAUSING CONSIDERABLY MORE DAMAGE AND PERSONAL INJURY.",
