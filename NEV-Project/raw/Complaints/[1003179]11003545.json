        "summary": "THE 2016 HONDA PILOT HAS A BAD HEADLIGHTS BEING TOO DIMMED DURING NIGHT DRIVES, THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN YOUR WINDOWS AND WINDSHIELDS ARE TINTED. SECONDLY, THE REVERSE OR BACKUP LIGHTS ARE LOCATED IN A VERY LOW POSITION DOWN AT THE BUMPER, WHEREIN IT MAY NOT BE SEEN BY CARS FROM BEHIND WHEN WE'RE REVERSING. THESE LIGHTING ISSUES ARE A SAFETY RISK.   THIRD, THE FRONT SEATS ARE QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE, POORLY DESIGNED FOR LONG-DRIVES AND IS A SAFETY RISK ESPECIALLY FOR HARD AND TIGHT TURNS WHERE WE SLIDE OFF TO THE SIDES OF OUR SEATS.",
