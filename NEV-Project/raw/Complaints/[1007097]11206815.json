        "summary": "THE STEERING STARTED PULLING LEFT OR RIGHT  AFTER THE CAR WAS STARTED AND DRIVEN . WOULD STOP  AFTER THE THE IGNITION WAS TURNED OFF AND  TURNED BACK ON.  I THINK THE PROBLEM IS   WHEN THE BATTERY IS LOW ON AMPS AND YOU TURN ON THE IGNITION THE LOW AMPS MESSES UP THE ELECYRICAL POWER ASSIST OR THE STEERING SENCER AND LOCKS THE STEERING PROBLEM IN WHEN YOU START THE CAR AND THEN IT\"S RUNNING OFF THE ELECTRICAL ALTERANOR. BECAUSE  IS YOU PULL OVER AND STOP AND RESTART THE CAR SOME TIMES IT WILL FIX THE PROBLEM TILL YOU RESTART THE CAR. I REPLACED THE LOW AMP BATTERY AND IT FIXED THE PROBLEM FOR NOW. TOOK TOYATO TOMATO AND THEY COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. PROBLEM COULD BE FIXED WITH A VOLTAGE REGULATOR OR WIRE CHANGE DIRECTLY TO THE ALT. REAL DANGERS PROBLEM ALMOST PULLED ME IN TO THE OTHER LANE!!!!",
