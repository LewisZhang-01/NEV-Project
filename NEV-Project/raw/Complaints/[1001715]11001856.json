        "summary": "THIS IS FOR A 2008.5 MAZDA3. THE ISSUE I AM REPORTING IS WITH A \"SOFT PEDAL\" CAUSED BY A MALFUNCTION IN THE ABS SYSTEM. THIS PROBLEM BEGAN WHEN DRIVING OVER A BUMP AND SIMULTANEOUSLY PRESSING DOWN ON THE BRAKES. THE BRAKES AND ABS SYSTEM ENGAGE AND CAR SLOWS DOWN. HOWEVER, AFTER THAT, THE PEDAL LOSES PRESSURE AND NEEDS TO BE PUSHED ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FLOOR IN ORDER TO GET THE CAR TO STOP. THIS ISSUE CAN BE FIXED BY ACTIVATING THE ABS SYSTEM AGAIN AND COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP. HOWEVER, WHEN BRAKING OVER A BUMP AGAIN THE ISSUE CONTINUES TO HAPPEN.     IT LOOKS LIKE THIS ISSUE HAS RECENTLY STARTED TO BECOME WIDELY REPORTED FOR MAZDA3, MAZDA6, AND FORD FUSIONS. I AM SEEING THAT THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION OPENED IN DECEMBER 2016 FOR THE FORD FUSION AND THE MERCURY MILAN. I WOULD LIKE TO REPORT THAT THIS DEFECT IS ALSO EVIDENT IN MAZDA'S AS WELL.     THERE IS A LOT OF CONFUSION AS TO WHAT IS CAUSING THIS PROBLEM AND IT SEEMS MOST PEOPLE GO AND REPLACE THEIR MASTER CYLINDER, CALIPERS, BRAKE PADS, ECT. IN ORDER TO FIX THE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM LOOKS TO BE WITH THE HYDRAULIC'S IN THE ABS SYSTEM.",
