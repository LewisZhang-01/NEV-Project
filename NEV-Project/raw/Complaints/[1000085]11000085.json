THE TIRE PRESSURE, TRACTION CONTROL, EMERGENCY LIGHT COMES ON. BOTH TIMES I HAVE SAFELY BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT TO THE SHOULDER. THE FIRST TIME, I HAD MY CAR TOWED TO AUTO REPAIR SHOP. THEIR $300 DIAGNOSIS REPORTED NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR. THE SECOND TIME, I TURNED MY CAR OFF & ON AGAIN ON THE SHOULDER. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STAYED ON AND I AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE TO MY DESTINATION. THE CHECK ENGINE IS NOW BACK OFF, BUT I HAVE DROPPED IT OFF AT THE SAME AUTO REPAIR SHOP, AND THEY ARE REPLACING AN AIR FLOW SENSOR IN HOPES THAT THIS RESOLVES THE PROBLEM. THIS WILL COST US ANOTHER $300. BOTH TIMES I HAD MY 18 MONTH OLD IN MY CAR. I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED.",
