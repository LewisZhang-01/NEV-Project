I CALLED HYUNDAI AND THEY WANTED TO CHARGE A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE A MONOPOLY ON THE REPAIRS BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE CAN GET THE PARTS. FROM LOOKING ONLINE THERE ARE NUMEROUS ISSUES WITH HYUNDAIS SRS. MANY RECALLS HAVE INCLUDED THE SEAT BELTS AND AIR BAGS. THERE SHOULDN'T BE ANY REASON THE AIR BAG LIGHT IS ON ON MY DASH BOARD OTHER THAN THAT IT IS A HYUNDAI ISSUE.",
