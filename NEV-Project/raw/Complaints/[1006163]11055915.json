WE HAVE TRIED THAT ENTIRE TIME TO HAVE THIS FIXED, BUT THE DEALERS TELL US THE PARTS ARE NOT YET AVAILABLE.  SINCE THIS CAUSES DEATH, I AM VERY CONCERNED WITH DRIVING THIS CAR AND THE POSSIBILITY OF THE AIRBAG DEPLOYING AND KILLING SOMEONE NEEDLESSLY.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE RECALL DOES NOT HAVE A REMEDY FOR IT WHEN OTHER CARS HAVE A SAFE DEPLOLYMENT.  WHY CAN'T THE TAKATA RECALL REPLACE THE CURRENT AIRBAG WITH ONE THAT IS INSTALLED ON OTHER MAKES AND MODELS TO ENSURE A SAFE DRIVE?   THIS RECALL SHOULD BE A PRIORITY!",
