AUDI HAS A RECALL FOR SEVERAL AUDI AND VW MODELS MANUFACTURED THE SAME YEAR, RECALL NUMBER 16V913000. AUDI OF AMERICA WAS NOTIFIED HOWEVER DECLINED RESPONSIBILITY ALLEGEDLY BECAUSE MY VEHICLE WAS NOT IN THE SPECIFIED VIN RANGE. ALTHOUGH MY VEHICLE IS PRESENTING THE SAME SYMPTOMS AS THOSE ON THE RECALL AUDI IS UNWILLING TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY. THE EXPERIENCE WAS VERY UNNERVING AS THE CAR SUDDENLY STOPPED WHILE DRIVING AND SUDDENLY ACCELERATED. FORTUNATELY THE CARS FOLLOWING BEHIND WERE ABLE TO STOP ON TIME AVOIDING A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. ASIDE FROM LOSING CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE, THE STEERING LOSES POSITION AND THE SPEEDOMETER STOPS WORKING. FURTHERMORE THE PART NEEDED FOR THE REPAIR HAS BEEN SUPERSEDED, THIS IS VERY SUSPICIOUS AS TO WHY THERE WILL BE A NEW PART NUMBER TO REPLACE THE ORIGINAL IF ALLEGEDLY THERE'S NO PROBLEMS WITH MINE...?",
