HONDA ACKNOWLEDGED THIS IS AN ENGINE DESIGN DEFECT AND ISSUED TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN 10-048 EXTENDING ENGINE WARRANTY TO 10 YRS (120 MOS), UNLIMITED MILEAGE, FREE ENGINE REPLACEMENT. MY ENGINE CRACKED AT 10 YRS, 3 MOS. CALLED HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE (CA) 800-999-1009. HONDA AGENT SAID CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY, HONDA CAN'T HELP ME. SPOKE TO HONDA AGENT'S REGIONAL MANAGER; SAME STORY, UNWILLING TO HELP. IF ENGINE CRACKED 3 MOS EARLIER, FREE REPLACEMENT. I OFFERED TO SHARE REPAIR COST, HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER SAID NO, AND SHE WOULD NOT LET ME SPEAK TO HER SUPERIOR. SHE TOLD ME TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION IF I FELT HONDA OWED ME SOMETHING. NEW ENGINE IS A $4000-$5000 FIX, MORE THAN VALUE OF CAR. I'M STUCK WITH WORTHLESS CIVIC WITH CRACKED ENGINE AND ONLY 124K MILES. WILL NEVER BUY HONDA AGAIN AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE. BUYER BEWARE OF USED 2006-2009 HONDA CIVICS.",
