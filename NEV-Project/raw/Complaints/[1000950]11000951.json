FEB 2016 CAR HAD TO GO BACK IN MY TRUNK LOCK WOULD NOT RELEASE. OCT 2016, ENGINE HAD A LOUD KNOCKING SOUND AFTER OIL CHANGE & SERVICE AT THE SAME DEALERSHIP,  I HAD TO HAVE AN ENGINE CHANGE, CHECK ENGINE LIGHT NEVER GOES OFF. AS RECENT AS MAY 26, 2017 MY CAR FAILED , OIL LIGHT FLICKERING, CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON. I RECEIVED THE CAR BACK ON JUN 22, 2017 AFTER ANOTHER ENGINE CHANGE. THE CAR'S CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS STILL ON CALLED THE DEALERSHIP BACK AND WILL TAKE THE CAR . THE DEALERSHIP HAS SCHEDULED THIS TUESDAY & THAT THEY WILL KEEP THE CAR AGAIN FOR ANOTHER COUPLE OF DAYS.  IT IS VERY DISTURBING BECAUSE MY CAR HAS NOW HAD 2 ENGINE CHANGE AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT IS STILL ON. I HAVE LOST THE VALUE IN THE CAR AND IT IS & WAS LEMON CAR.  HYUNDAI SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN FOR SELLING FAULTY CARS.  I WAS DRIVING THE CAR ON THE HIGHWAY AT EACH ENGINE FAILURE.  I HAVE ALL MY RECORDS ON HAND.",
