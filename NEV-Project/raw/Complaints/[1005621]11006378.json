TOOK IT TO THE DEALER THEY STATED I HAD PLACED A COIN IN THE RADIO HENCE THE SYSTEM SHUTTING DOWN I HAD TO PAY TO REPLACE EVERYTHING. THEN 2 MONTHS LATER THE AC WENT AGAIN. TOOK IT IN AT THE ONE YEAR MARK THE CAR NEEDS TYRES, BRAKES, TROTLE BODY, INJECTORS AND ENGINE FILTERS. HOWEVER LEXUS REFUS TO HELP IN ANY WAY AND I DEED THIS TO BE UNFAIR CONSIDERING THIS CAR HAS SUCH FAULTS I REPLACED THE TYRES MY SELF HOWEVER THEY ARE NOT FIXIN THE ISSUES CAUSING THE TYRES TO GO BAD OR ISSUES MENTIONED. AFTER ONE YEAR BRAND NEW CAR I DON'T FEEL I SHOULD BE HAVING THIS MUCH ISSUE I DEED THIS CAR TO BE A LEMON. IM COMPLETELY DISGUSTED BY LEXUS AND WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER.    THE CAR ALSO SHUT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF DRIVING",
