        "summary": "EXHAUST PIPE CONNECTION RUSTED THROUGH.  SAME EXACT PROBLEM SOMEONE ELSE NOTED ON THEIR COMPLAINT.  CONNECTION USED BETWEEN MUFFLER AND TAILPIPE COMPLETELY RUSTED AWAY LEAVING THE TAILPIPE DANGLING FROM BOTTOM OF TRUCK. THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DESIGN ISSUE IN WHICH ALL NISSAN TITAN TRUCKS SINCE ORIGINAL RELEASE HAD A CONNECTOR PIECE THAT IS NOT GALVANIZED FOR RUST PREVENTION WELDED TO THE BEGINNING OF THE TAILPIPE AND THE END OF THE MUFFLER PIPE EXTENSION. THESE PIECES ARE THEN BOLTED TOGETHER WITH BOLTS THAT AREN'T GALVANIZED. THE CONNECTION PIECES ARE FLANGED SO THEY HOLD WATER AND START RUSTING.  THE TRUCK STARTED TO SHAKE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I WAS AT STOP LIGHT OR STOP SIGN.  COULD NOT FIGURE PROBLEM.  I WAS GETTING MY TRUCK READY TO GET MY WIFE FROM THE AIRPORT WHEN MY SON NOTICE THE TAIL PIPE WAS CROOKED.  WHEN HE LOOKED UNDERNEATH IT WAS COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED FROM MUFFLED.  I LOOKED EXCEPT FOR THE CONNECTION FROM MUFFLER TO TAILPIPE EVERYTHING IS FINE.  IN FACT IT IS THE ONLY PART WAS COMPLETELY RUSTED AWAY.  NO OTHER PART UNDERNEATH HAD THIS CORROSION.    IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THIS WAS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT IN USE OF MATERIALS NOT SUITED FOR   ANY WEATHER CONDITIONS.  IF I HAD LEFT TO GET MY WIFE WITH THE TRUCK LIKE THIS, THE PIPE COULD HAVE FALLEN OFF ON THE HIGHWAY AND CAUSED SOME MAJOR ISSUES.",
