THIS WAS DURING RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC. IF STOPPED ON A HILL, IT WOULD ROLL BACKWARDS. VERY DANGEROUS. THE RPM'S FREQUENTLY WENT HIGH BEFORE SHIFTING. I JUST BOUGHT THIS A MONTH AGO. NOTICED HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE. TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS. MANY PEOPLE GETTING NEW TRANSMISSION AFTER LONG BATTLES WITH THE DEALER AND PUT IN DANGEROUS DRIVING CONDITIONS. SOME WITH CHILDREN IN THE CAR. JEEP IN SHOP ALREADY. HELP!",
