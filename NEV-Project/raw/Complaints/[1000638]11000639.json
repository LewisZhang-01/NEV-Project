AT THE TIME, MY HEADLAMPS  WERE WORKING PROPERLY, SO THE LETTER ADVISED ME TO NOT TAKE MY VEHICLE TO MY GMC DEALER. HOWEVER, TWO DAYS AGO MY HEADLAMPS DID NOT WORK AT NIGHT WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY. THIS CAUSED A SEVERE SAFETY ISSUE AS I COULD NOT SEE THE ROAD CLEARLY.      I TOOK MY VEHICLE AND THE LETTER I RECEIVED TO MY GMC DEALER. THEY ADVISED ME THAT GMC WOULD NOT PAY TO FIX THE HEADLAMP PROBLEM AS I HAD MORE THAN 150,000 MILES      IN A SITUATION WHERE CUSTOMER SAFETY IS INVOLVED, I BELIEVE GMC SHOULD PAY FOR THE REPAIRS. I HAD TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS OUT-OF-POCKET.    I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOULD BE A SAFETY RECALL NOTICE INITIATED BY THE MANUFACTURER TO CORRECT THIS ISSUE.  WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR MULTIPLE ACCIDENTS AND TRAFFIC FATALITIES TO PROMPT A RECALL FOR AN IMPORTANT SAFETY FEATURE ON A VEHICLE.",
