        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING 4 LANE DEVIDED HIGHWAY AT NIGHT WITH NO TRAFFIC, LARGE PLASTIC TRIM PIECES   STARTED FLYING OFF.  I WAS ABLE TO STOP & WITH MY POLICE MAGLITE CONFIRMED I HAD NOT HIT ANYTHING. THE WHEEL TRIM PIECE PASSENGER FRONT CAME OFF & FLEW UP INTO THE REAR WHEEL WELL, KNOCKING IT LOSE AS WELL. ON THE SAME TRIP, A PIECE CAME LOSE ON I-95 AT NIGHT. I STOPPED & PULLED THE CLANGING PIECE THE REST OF THE WAY OFF TO AVOID DAMAGING THE PAINT. IT WASN'T WORTH RISKING MY LIFE. CHECKING LATER A BLACK VENT COVER ON THE FRONT BUMPER HAD COME OFF ALONG WITH AN ACCESS PANEL ON THE BUMPER. I DON'T RATTLE EASILY DRIVING BUT IT SHOOK ME UP A BIT, AN INEXPERIENCED DRIVER WOULD HAVE A WRECK. BUDGET RENT A CAR HERNDON VA INSISTS I HAD AN ACCIDENT, I DID NOT. I HAVE PICS & BELIEVE THIS WAS ACTUALLY PRIOR DAMAGE THAT WAS NOT PROPERLY REPAIRED. IN SHORT I WAS RENTED A COSMETICLY REPAIRED DAMAGED CAR, PUTTING CUSTOMERS AT RISK. IN CASE IT'S A DESIGN FLAW, I THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE CALLED OUT. I DID NOTICE TWO DESIGN ISSUES I BELIEVE MAY CAUSE DRIVERS PROBLEMS.  IN BOTH CASES THE CAR WAS BEING DRIVEN NORMALLY ON CLEAR OR MODERATE CONDITIONS. ONE OF THE PHOTOS SHOWS THE CLEAR TAPE CONSISTENT WITH A HEADLIGHT HAVING BEEN REPLACED.",
