I WAS TOLD TODAY 7/10 THE FIX HAS NOT EVEN BEEN DEVELOPED YET.  IS THIS TRUE?  I WAS MADE TO BELIEVE IT WOULD BE SOMETHING RELATIVELY EASY TO FIX AND COULD BE SCHEDULED IN THE FUTURE.  MY DEALERSHIP CANNOT TELL ME WHAT TIMEFRAME I AM LOOKING AT.  THEY SAID NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT I SHOULDN'T HAVE A PASSENGER RIDE IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT.  ***IS THERE AN ETA...AND ESTIMATED TIME TO EXPECT DEVELOPMENT ON THE FIX FOR THE PASSENGER AIRBAG?*** I WAS PROMISED BY THE SALESMAN THAT I COULD HAVE THE AIRBAG FIXED WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR BACK FOR DETAILING (I WAS ASKED TO TAKE THE CAR OFF THE LOT AND BRING IT BACK LATER FOR DETAILING.)   FINDING OUT NOW MORE ABOUT POSSIBLY HAVING TO WAIT A LONG TIME OR NEVER BE ABLE TO GET THE AIRBAG REPLACED IS MAKING ME VERY NERVOUS.",
