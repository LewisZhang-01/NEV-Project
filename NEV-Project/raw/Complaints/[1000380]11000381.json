        "summary": "ON 20JUN2017, THE REAR AXLE BROKE.  AS PART OF A FORD RECALL, THE AXLE HAD REINFORCEMENT BRACKETS INSTALLED BY (GRAHAM) FORD OF MANSFIELD.  THOSE BRACKETS WERE INSPECTED BY (GRAHAM) FORD OF MANSFIELD IN 2015 AND WERE DECLARED TO HAVE BEEN INSTALLED AS PER FORD MOTOR COMPANY INSTRUCTIONS AND, AS A CONSUMER, I BELIEVE I HAD THE RIGHT TO ASSUME THAT THEREFORE THE AXLE WAS SAFE.  THE AXLE BREAK IS OBVIOUS EVIDENCE THAT THE BRACKETS WERE EITHER NOT INSTALLED PROPERLY OR WERE INADEQUATE.  THUS I BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM IS MORE WITH THE DEALER NOT BEING COMPETENT TO RECOGNIZE THE DANGEROUS CORROSION THAT HAD HAPPENED.  OF COURSE, IN OHIO, WHERE THE LAW REQUIRES THAT VEHICLES BE SOLD THROUGH DEALERS, THE DEALER ACTS AS AN AGENT FOR THE MANUFACTURER.  IN 2015, AT THE TIME OF THE INSPECTION, I WAS TOLD THAT THE BRACKET FIX WAS GOOD BUT THEN I WAS ALSO OFFERED A REPLACEMENT AXLE FOR A TOTAL COST TO ME OF $300.  MY POSITION WAS THAT EITHER THE AXLE WAS GOOD AND SAFE OR IT WAS NOT GOOD AND NOT SAFE  AND IN THAT CASE A REPLACEMENT AXLE SHOULD  HAVE BEEN INSTALLED.  SO WHY SHOULD I SPEND $300 FOR AN AXLE THAT WAS SAFE SO I DECLINED.  IN RETROSPECT, THE FIX OBVIOUSLY WAS NOT SAFE.",
