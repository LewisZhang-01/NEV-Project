HEAT TURNED ON, WINDSHIELD WIPERS TURNED ON, BLINKERS GOING OFF, RADIO TURNED OFF. POWER STEERING, GAS AND BRAKES STOPPED WORKING. WAS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY HIGHWAY BECAUSE OF THIS AND LUCKY I DID NOT GET HIT BECAUSE OF THE SPOT I WAS IN. I GOT THE CAR TOWED AND SENT TO A MECHANIC. IT WAS THE ALTERNATOR THAT WENT BAD AND IT BURNED THE BATTERY SO HAD TO GET THAT REPLACES AS WELL. VERY DANGEROUS WITH NO WARNING SIGNS. I HAVE HEARD THIS PROBLEM IS COMMON IN THESE VEHICLES.",
