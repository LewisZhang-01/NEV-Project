DEALER SAYS IT IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THOR AFFECTING MULTIPLE MODELS BUT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM, WHICH SEEMS TO BE IN THE DESIGN OF THE WIPER ARM ANGLE. HAD TO USE SHORTER WIPER BLADES THAN RECOMMENDED TO TRY AND EASE THE PROBLEM BUT THAT REDUCES VISIBILITY WHICH IS ALSO A SAFETY HAZARD. DUE TO PROBLEM AND LIMITED ADJUSTIBILITY, WIPERS DO NOT FULLY COVER THE WINDSHIELD STOPPING WITHIN THE DIRECT EYESIGHT BOTH IN FRONT OF DRIVER AS WELL AS PASSENGER.",
