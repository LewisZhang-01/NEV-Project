THIS BEGAN HAPPENING IN LOCAL TRAFFIC, THEN ON THE INTERSTATE AT HIGH RATES OF SPEED. GM HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THIS ISSUE, EVEN AFTER NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO REPAIR THIS VERY DANGEROUS MALFUNCTION WITHOUT SUCCESS, THEY ARE UNWILLING TO ADDRESS IT WITH A RECALL. THE MOST DANGEROUS OF THE NUMEROUS TIMES THIS HAPPENED WAS ON 4/27/17. I HAD JUST LEFT MOSES GM OF CHARLESTON, WV AFTER THEY HAD REPAIRED THE VEHICLE FOR THIS ISSUE. I DROVE APPROXIMATELY 5 MILES ON INTERSTATE 64 BEFORE LOSING POWER, AND ALMOST BEING STRUCK BY A VEHICLE ON THE SOUTH CHARLESTON BRIDGE. THE DEALERSHIP TOWED ME BACK TO THE SERVICE CENTER WHERE THE VEHICLE WAS ONCE AGAIN UNSUCCESSFULLY REPAIRED. IT SEEMS THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE WITH GM VEHICLES AROUND THE SAME TIME PERIOD, AND NOT JUST THE HUMMER LINE. ANY HELP WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.",
