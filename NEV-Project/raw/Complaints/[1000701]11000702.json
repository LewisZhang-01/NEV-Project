        "summary": "THIS SEAT BELT IS 3RD ROW DRIVERS SIDE. UNTIL 2 YEARS AGO THIS BELT WAS USED LESS THAN ONCE A YEAR. WITH THE ADDITION OF A THIRD GRAND CHILD IT WAS NECESSARY TO USE THE THIRD ROW SEATING, USING THE DRIVERS SIDE SEAT. THE 7 YEAR OLD SAT THERE ABOUT 3 TIMES A MONTH AN HOUR EACH TIME FOR 1 YEAR. WITH NO BOOSTER SEAT. A YEAR AGO WE PUT THE 4 YEAR OLD IN THAT SEAT AS SHE ONLY NEEDED A BOOSTER SEAT AND WAS QUITE CAPABLE OF BUCKLING HERSELF IN. THE AMOUNT OF USAGE DID NOT CHANGE. THE DAMAGE STARTS 1 MILLIMETER OUTSIDE OF THE UPPER ANCHOR SLIDE AND GOES FOR ABOUT 18 INCHES OF BELT THAT PULLS THROUGH THE UPPER ANCHOR SLIDE. IT REALLY DOES NOT PULL ACROSS ANYTHING ELSE.  I HAVE EXAMINED THE OTHER BELTS AND ONLY THE DRIVERS BELT SHOWS AN EXTREMELY SMALL AMOUNT OF WEAR IN EXACTLY THE SAME AREA; THE LOWER EDGE OF THE BELT THAT FIRST PULLS THROUGH THE UPPER ANCHOR SLIDE. I CANNOT EVEN FIND ANY PARTS OF THE BELT THAT HAVE DISINTEGRATED. LAYING AROUND BELOW THE BELT..      ON 6/17/2017 THE 4 YEAR OLD CLIMBED INTO THE SEAT.  SHE TOLD ME IT WAS BROKE.  I WAS SHOCKED,WHEN I EXAMINED THE BELT AT THE CONDITION OF THE BELT.",
