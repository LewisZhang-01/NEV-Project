        "summary": "CAR APPEARED TO BE RUNNING FINE. WENT TO GET A SMOG, \" CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT ON, AS A RESULT I FAILED SMOG. CODE REVEALED WAS PO741( TORQUE CONVERTER CLUTCH CIRCUIT PERFORMANCE OR STUCK OFF) UPON VEHICLE INSPECTION FROM CANAL TRANSMISSION IN EL CAJON, CA. OWNER REVEALED THAT HE HAD COME ACROSS THIS PROBLEM ABOUT 10 TIMES WITH TOYOTA COROLLAS. HE REVEALED THAT EACH TIME HE TRIED TO FIX TORQUE CONVERTER,  CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WOULD STILL REMAIN WITH SAME CODE AFTER REPAIR. HE SAID THEY FINALLY REALIZED THAT IT WAS AN ECM ISSUE AND NOT A TRANSMISSION PROBLEM. IN 2010 TOYOTA DID A RECALL ON ECM. SO WHAT DO I DO? CODE IS PREVENTING ME FROM GETTING A SMOG, YET WHEN REPAIR OF TORQUE CONVERTER ATTEMPTED CHECK ENGINE CODE PO741 STILL REMAINS. I CONTACTED DEALER REGARDING CODE, THEY SCANNED CAR, THE SAME CODE APPEARED. ALL THEY OFFERED WAS 400 TO TEAR INTO TRANSMISSION TO SEE IF THEY COULD FIND ISSUE. SO IN CLOSING , WE HAVE A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT REVEALING CODE P0741; THAT WHEN REPAIRS ATTEMPTED ,REPAIR CANT SEEM TO BE FIXED SATISFACTORILY TO CLEAR THE LIGHT, BECAUSE THROUGH EXPERIENCE OF TRANSMISSION SHOP IT IS A FAULTY CODE AND THE REAL PROBLEM LIES WITHIN THE ECM, WHICH WAS SUPPOSEDLY  FIXED DURING TOYOTA RECALL. SO WHAT DO I DO? I NEED MY CAR SMOGGED TO DRIVE.WHAT OTHER PROBLEMS WILL THE ECM CREATE IN THE FUTURE? TOYOTA NEEDS TO RECALL ECM AGAIN FOR THIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM AND OTHER PROBLEMS THAT MAY BE CREATED DUE TO THE FAULT Y ECM.",
