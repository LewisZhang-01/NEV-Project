SWAPPED FUSE WITH ANOTHER KNOWN WORKING FUSE, BOTH FUSES WORKED BUT WIPERS STILL DID NOT WORK. LATER WIPERS STARTED WORKING WITHOUT PROMPT, AGAIN CAUSING VISIBILITY ISSUES AS IT WAS NOT RAINING, BUT WOULD NOT SLOW DOWN OR TURN OFF. SHUT CAR OFF, REMOVED KEY FROM IGNITION AND WIPERS CONTINUED TO RUN UNTIL FUSE WAS PULLED AGAIN.",
