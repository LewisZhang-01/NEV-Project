THE ENGINE SERVICE LIGHT COMES ON AND MUST BE TAKEN TO DEALER FOR SERVICE. MITSUBISHI DOES A SIMPLE SOFTWARE UPGRADE TO THE ECM AND RESETS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT IS MITSUBISHI IS SIMPLY LETTING THESE VEHICLES GET TO THIS FAILURE POINT AND VEHICLES CAN GO INTO LIMP MODE (MEANING DRIVE NO FASTER THAN 45MPH) RATHER THAN PROACTIVELY AVOIDING THE PROBLEM. FURTHER, THEY ARE KNOWINGLY ALLOWING VEHICLES TO GET PAST THE WARRANTY PERIOD WITHOUT REPAIR THUS FORCING CUSTOMERS TO PAY TO HAVE THIS KNOWN ISSUE RESOLVED. TO ADD TO THE PROBLEM IS MITSUBISHI WILL NOT ALLOW NON-MITSUBISHI SERVICE CENTERS, MECHANICS OR REPAIR SHOPS TO UPDATE THE ECM AND I AM FORCED TO TAKE IT TO AN AUTHORIZED MITSUBISHI DEALER FOR FIXING. BECAUSE THESE VEHICLES HAVE HAD OTHER SAFETY RECALLS AND WARRANTY REPAIR WORK, THEY SHOULD HAVE SIMPLY TAKEN 15 MINUTES TO  UPGRADED THE ECM SOFTWARE AND RESET AT THE TIME TO AVOID THIS FROM HAPPENING RATHER THAN LETTING THE WARRANTY EXPIRE AND CHARGING ME TO FIX A KNOWN ISSUE.",
