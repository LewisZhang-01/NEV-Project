        "summary": "This is the second time in a year that the brakes in our vehicle have stopped working. The pedal goes all the way to the ground and does not completely stop the car. We had the issue dealt with last year at the dealership where we had our vehicle towed to. It was only then that we were notified that there was a recall on the hose that may affect the brakes and other functions of the vehicle.  It was replaced. This has now happened a second time while my husband and 2.5 year old were driving home.  If he was not able to have some control over the vehicle he and my child could have been killed or someone else on the road. I called the dealership to let them know that the car would be towed again and told the issue. They confirmed we dealt with this same issue just one year ago and I asked why is this happening and this is so unacceptable as my family's safety is at risk. I asked if there are any recalls or issues with the make and model that we should be aware of. After looking up the vehicle she then informed us there was indeed a recall for the flex hose which could cause leaks and affect the brakes. The vehicle is currently at the dealership being inspected. Due to where the leak is coming from it seems to be the left side of the vehicle now which tells me the dealership only replaced one of the hoses and not both causing this to happen again. This is negligence and I am beyond frustrated at the thought of what could have happened and I don't think waiting until someone is killed is the right time to fix this issue. There were no warning lamps, messages or symptoms prior to the failure, it just happened while driving and trying to stop.",
