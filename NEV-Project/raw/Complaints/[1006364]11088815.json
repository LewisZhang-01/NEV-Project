ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, UNDER RANDOM SITUATIONS IT HAS STARTED BEEPING AND SLOWING DOWN AND EVEN STOPPING FOR NO APPARENT REASON WHILE DRIVING.  I DROPPED IT OFF AT THE DEALER TO SEE IF THEY FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.  THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS!!! WE CAN GET REAR ENDED WHILE TRAVELING IN THE HIGHWAYS.  WE DRIVE WITH OUR CHILDREN OFTEN!!!!     ON A LESSER NOTE, THERE IS A CONSTANT CLICKING ON THE DRIVER SIDE SEAT , ALMOST LIKE THE SEAT DOES NOT LOCK.  I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER IN DECEMBER 2017 BUT THEY COULD NOT FIND THE PROBLEM.",
