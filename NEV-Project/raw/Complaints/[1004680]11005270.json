        "summary": "I HAVE A 2016 GMC SIERRA 1500 5.3L.  I'VE BROUGHT THE TRUCK DOWN TO THE DEALER 4 TIMES NOW BECAUSE THE AC DOESN'T BLOW COLD AIR.  THE AC STOPPED WORKING AGAIN THIS WEEK WITH THE TRUCK ONLY HAVING 2,800 MILES ON IT.  I CALLED GMC DIRECTLY (NOT THE DEALER) BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BRING THE TRUCK DOWN TO THE DEALER FOR THE 5TH TIME FOR THE SAME ISSUE.  IT'S 85+ DEGREES NOW WHERE I LIVE AND DRIVING WITHOUT AC IS UNBEARABLE, ESPECIALLY WHEN IN TRAFFIC.  GM SENT ME AN E-MAIL INFORMING ME THE AC CONDENSER IS FAULTY BY DESIGN AND A 'REDESIGN' HAS BEEN CREATED.  THE PART IS ON \"NATIONAL BACK ORDER\" WITH NO ETA.  THEY SAID IT COULD BE 4-6 WEEKS WHICH MEANS DRIVING MY TRUCK WITHOUT AC IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND NOT AN OPTION WITH CHILDREN IN THE TRUCK WHO CAN'T WITHSTAND THE HEAT.  I'M READING ON VARIOUS FORUMS THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING SINCE MARCH (4 MONTHS) FOR THE NEW CONDENSER TO COME IN.",
