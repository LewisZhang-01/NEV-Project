I HAVE TO PUT IN IN PARK AND TRY TO RESTART IT ABOUT 5 TIMES, EACH TIME THE OIL LIGHT COMES ON AND IT JUST STALLS, ONCE IT DOES CATCH THE SPEED FLUCTUATES UP AND DOWN BUT ABOUT 5 MINUTES LATER IT HAPPENS ALL OVER AGAIN.  I KNOW IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE OIL BECAUSE I HAD GOTTEN AN OIL CHANGE BEFORE I PUT THE GAS IN THE CAR.  THIS HAD HAPPENED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO SO I HAD JUST STOPPED FILLING THE CAR UP AND THIS TIME I FORGOT.  THE CAR CUTS OFF WHILE IN MOTION, YOU CAN'T TURN THE STEERING WHEEL, IT JUST STOPS WHERE EVER YOU ARE,  ALL I COULD DO WAS CUT ON THE HAZARDS AND KEEP TRYING TO RESTART IT, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE TRYING TO RESTART WHILE IT'S ALREADY ON, IT MAKES A SCREECHING SOUND, AND SOUNDS LIKE IT'S TRYING TO CATCH.",
