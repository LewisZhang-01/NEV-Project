WHEN CORRECTING IT WILL START TO TRAVEL IN THE CORRECTED DIRECTION AND WILL CONTINUE TO TRAVEL IN THAT DIRECTION UNTIL CORRECTING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.   HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE DIEALERSHIP 1X AND TOLD THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.  TECHNICIAN COMMENTS ON THE PAPERWORK \"VEHICLE DROVE FINE AND NOT WONDER ALL OVER THE ROAD\".  AFTER GETTING MINE BACK, TEST DROVE ANOTHER 2019 AND DID NOT EXPERIENCE THE SAME ISSUE.  IT WAS ABLE TO HOLD A STRAIGHT LINE WITH LITTLE TO NO INPUT.   HAVE DROVE OTHER NEW JEEPS THAT DID NOT HAVE THE WONDER ISSUE.   NOTE THE OTHER JEEPS HAVE HAD MICHELIN OR GOODYEAR TIRES.  MINE HAS BRIDGESTONE.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THIS IS JUST THE WAY THEY DRIVE.  I HAVE OWNED 7 JEEP WRANGLERS AND NONE HAVE DROVE LIKE THIS.   MY WIFE HAS A 2018 AND DOES NOT HAVE THE WANDERING ISSUE.  THIS HAPPENS AT ALL SPEEDS.",
