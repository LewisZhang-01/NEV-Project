A BYSTANDER CAME IN AND HAD TO SHIFT THE CAR TO DRIVE IN ORDER TO GET IT OFF OF MY WIFE'S FOOT. DURING THE ORDEAL, SHE SUSTAINED A HEAVY SPRAIN/STRAIN TO HER RIGHT ANKLE/FOOT, MULTIPLE SCRAPED, BRUISES, AND ROAD RASH ACROSS HER LEGS, ARMS AND BACK. IF ANYONE WOULD HAVE BEEN BEHIND THE CAR AT THE TIME OF ROLL AWAY, THEY COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. ATTACHED ARE PICTURES OF HER ANKLE/FOOT AS WELL AS A POLICE REPORT WHICH SOLIDIFIES MY CLAIM.",
