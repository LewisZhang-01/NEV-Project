AT THE TIME OF MY ENGINE FAILURE IT WAS A KNOWN ISSUE FOR PORSCHE (SEE WC-22) WHEREAS THEY DID NOT MAKE PUBLIC AWARE OR PROACTIVELY FIX THE ISSUE. THIS ENDED UP COSTING ME APPROXIMATELY $7500 OUT OF POCKET (IN ADDITION TO SEVERAL EMOTIONAL DAMAGE DUE TO FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND THE IMMEDIATE DANGER WHEN THE ENGINE FAILED AT HIGHWAY SPEED IN THE FAR LEFT LANE). PORSCHE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY ISSUED A RECALL (RECALL AH-08 AND NHTSA CAMPAIGN 17V368000) BUT HAD NOT CONTACTED AFFECTED OWNERS YET. I'D LIKE A FULL REFUND OF MY EXPENSES PLUS INTEREST. I ALSO FEEL THEY SHOULD BE FINED OR PAY IMPACTED OWNERS LIKE MYSELF A PENALTY DUE TO THEIR IMPROPER MISHANDLING.",
