THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS FOR PASSENGERS.  THIS SENSER FAILED WHEN THE CAR WAS 5 YEARS OLD, WE HAD ONLY OWNED IT FOR ABOUT A YEAR, HAD BOUGHT THE CAR USED.  VERY EXPENSIVE TO FIX $700 OR MORE FROM WHAT TH DEALER SAID. JUST STOPPED WORKING ONE DAY, SHOWING AN AIRBAG LIGHT AND THE FACT THAT THE AIRBAG IS SET TO OFF ON THE PASSENGER SEAT WITH/WITHOUT A PASSENGER IN THE CAR.",
