COASTED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, TURNED THE CAR OFF..WAITED A MINUTE..RE STARTED IT..STARTED TO DRIVE..WENT JUST A FEW FEET AND IT DID IT AGAIN...AGAIN..NO NOISE, WARNING LIGHTS..NOTHING. I MADE A PHONE CALL..I WAS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER FROM A CAR REPAIR SHOP. REALLY KINDA COASTED IN. OF COURSE THEY LOOKED AT IT..GAVE ME THE GREAT NEWS AS TO IT HAD CATASTROPHIC TRANSMISSION FAILURE. I HAD IT TOWED FROM THERE TO A FORD DEALERSHIP..THEY FOUND THE SAME ISSUE. THE TOW COMPANY THAT TOWED MY CAR IN THE NEXT 2 WEEKS TOWED 4 OF THEM..ALL WITH TRANSMISSION ISSUES. I ALSO TALKED TO A TRANSMISSION SHOP THAT STATED FORD IS HAVING AND HAS BEEN HAVING TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS. IR WAS A LITTLE SCARY AND DANGEROUS TO BE DRIVING 55MPH IN MORNING TRAFFIC AND HAVE YOUR CAR JUST WAIT MOVING.",
