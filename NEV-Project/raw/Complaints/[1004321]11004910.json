I HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT MANY TIMES WITH THE PERSON WHO IS SUPPOSED TO HELP AND RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT I WILL BE AWARDED $40.00 A DAY FOR A RENTAL CAR UNTIL THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN FIXED AND I CAN HAVE MY CAR FIXED. HOWEVER I CAN NOT GET AN APPROPRIATE VEHICLE FOR $40.00 A DAY. PLUS I CAN NOT AFFORD TO PAY THE MONEY UPFRONT TO GET A RENTAL VEHICLE. IT WOULD BE MUCH CHEAPER TO JUST HAVE YOU GUYS PAY IT OFF. MY CAR WOULD OF ALREADY BEEN PAID OFF IF SOMEONE WOULD HAVE DONE SO IN THE BEGINING. I AM WRITE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE CAR IS NOW HAVING ISSUES; IT KEEPS MAKING A LOUD CLICKING NOISE WHEN IT FIRST STARTS AS WELL AS WHEN IT STOPS AND PERIODICALLY WHEN IT ISN'T EVEN BEING DRIVEN. IT ALSO LEAKS WATER INTO THE TRUNK WHEN IT IS WET OUTSIDE. I AM ASKING ONCE AGAIN FOR THIS CAR TO BE PAID OFF, I CAN NOT SELL OR TRADE THIS VEHICLE AND AM STILL MAKING PAYMENTS ON IT. I AM ASKING TO GET THIS PAID OFF, IF NOT I HAVE CONTACTED A LAWYER AND WILL PROCEED WITH A LAW SUIT, I REALLY DO NOT WISH TO PERSUE THIS HOWEVER IT HAS BEEN NINE MONTHS AND I NEED THIS RESOLVED.",
