I WAS DRIVING AND THE REAR CAMERA CAME ON WHILE IN DRIVE.  I PULLED INTO A PARKING LOT.  WHEN I STARTED THE CAR I HAD NO BRAKES AND NO POWER STEERING.  I TURNED OFF THE CAR AND TURNED IT BACK ON AND IT WAS FINE.  I HAD IT TOWED IN FOR SERVICE AND THE DEALERSHIP SERVICE CENTER SAID THE COMPUTER HAD NO CODES TO INDICATE ANY PROBLEM AND THEY CAN NOT RECREATE THE PROBLEM.  ALSO, THE BATTERY HAS BEEN REPLACED ON THIS VEHICLE AT LEAST 3 TIMES.",
