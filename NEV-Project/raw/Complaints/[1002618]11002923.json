GOT TO PARK A BLOCK AWAY, TURNED TRUCK OFF AND IT NEVER STARTED AGAIN.  TOWED TO A MECHANIC . $1100 LATER, MECHANIC SAYS TOW IT TO  THE NISSAN DEALER FOR A DIAGNOSTIC BECAUSE THE MODULAR INSIDE THE TRANSMISSION IS NOT WORKING AND THEY CAN TELL WHAT'S WRONG. I GET IT TOWED TO NISSAN  DEALER FOR $90 AND $450(3HRS OF LABOR TO DIAGNOSE TRUCK)  LATER, NISSAN SAID  RADIATOR FLUID CROSS CONTAMINATED WITH TRANSMISSION AND RUINED IT.
