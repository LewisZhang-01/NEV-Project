        "summary": "DRIVING VEHICLE ON HWY 408 (EAST WEST EXPY) ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON AROUND 5PM ON 6.23.17, AND FRONT PART OF THE PANORAMIC SUNROOF SHATTERED.  I HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE AN EXPLOSION COMING FROM TOP OF CAR.  PULLED OVER AND SAW THAT THE OUTISDE GLASS OF THE FRONT PART OF THE SUNROOF HAD SHATTERED WITH GLASS COMING INTO MY  DRIVER SIDE AS WELL AS I AM SURE THE REMAINING GLASS SHATTERED TOWARDS OUTSIDE. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS COULD HAPPEN WHILE DRIVIING UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THE EXPERIENCE WAS SHOCKING AND FRIGHTENING.  I WAS GLAD THERE WERE NO PASSENGERS WITH ME.    I WENT TO MASSEY CADILLAC LOCATED ON ORANGE BLOSSOM TRAIL IN ORLANDO.  I WANT THIS DOCUMENTED BY THE DEALER AND URGING FOR A SOLUTION TO THIS SITUATION.  THERE WERE NO OBJECTS COMING FROM ABOVE THAT HIT THE SUNROOF.  IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE, IN MY OPINION SOMETHNG VERY VERY HEAVY!  THE DEALER SERVICE REP STATED THAT I COME BACK ON MONDAY, 6.26, 17 TO SEE WHAT IS DECIDED ON THE MATTER.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT COULD HAVE ENDED TRAGICALLY.  I DEPEND ON MY CAR FOR BUSINESS .",
