TOOK TO DEALER, STATED IT WAS A FUEL PUMP PROBLEM, THAT THE FUEL PUMP IN THE TRUCK BLEW UP AND SENT METAL SHREDS THROUGH THE FUEL RAIL SYSTEM AND INTO THE ENGINE. FORD DENIED THE WARRANTY STATING THE FUEL WAS CONTAMINATED WITH TO MUCH WATER. UPON HAVING MY FUEL TESTED, IT WAS DETERMINED IT WAS NOT CONTAMINATED AND THEY PAID 9000 OF REPAIR COST, AND I PAID 1000. I HAVE TWO VEHICLES (THE OTHER WHICH I WILL ALSO MAKE A COMPLAINT AS WELL) AND BOTH VEHICLES HAVE UNSAFETLY SHUT OFF AND LOST POWER.   AFTER DOING RESEARCH, THE FUEL PUMP IN THE TRUCKS IN NOT RATED FOR THE LUBRICITY THE DIESEL FUEL IN AMERICA OFFERS. I HAVE SPOKEN TO SEVERAL MECHANICS WHO SAID THE PUMP WILL BLOW UP IF YOU DO NOT USE A FUEL ADDITIVE. FUEL SPECIFICALLY STATES TO USE UNITED STATES ULTRA LOW DIESEL FUEL IN THEIR SYSTEM, AND DOES NOT REQUIRE THEIR CONSUMERS TO USE FUEL ADDITIVES. THE PUMP IS NOT RATED, AND FORD IS PUTTING THESE PUMPS IN THEIR TRUCKS KNOWING THEIR NOT RATED FOR ULSD IN THE UNTIED STATED.",
