THE FIRST TIME THE ALTERNATOR CAUGHT ON FIRE IT WAS IN IDLE, STATIONARY.  THE SECOND ALTERCATION AFTER PICKING IT UP FROM THE DEALERSHIP IT HAD INTERIOR/EXTERIOR LIGHTS GOING ON AND OFF ALONG WITH MY WINDSHIELD WIPERS OPERATING WHILE OFF.  I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS SINCE PURCHASING THIS VEHICLE AND BELIEVE I WAS SOLD A LEMON.  I WOULD LIKE TO GET THIS ADDRESSED ASAP!  THANKS MUCH.",
