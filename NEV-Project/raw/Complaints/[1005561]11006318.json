I DROVE IT FOR 5 MORE MINUTES AND THE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN AND THE CAR COMPLETELY SHUT OFF ON ME AS I WAS DRIVING. THE CAR HAS 109,000 MILES AND WAS MAINTAINED REGULARLY. I TOOK IT TO MY MECHANIC AND HE TOLD ME EITHER THE ENGINE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED OR REBUILT COSTING ME ANYWHERE BETWEEN $5000 AND $7000. NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS AND WAS TERRIFIED THAT THE CAR COMPLETELY SHUT OFF ON ME ON THE HIGHWAY.",
