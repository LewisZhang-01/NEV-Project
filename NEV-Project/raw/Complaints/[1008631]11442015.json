        "summary": "The power steering failed.  Specifically, the Chevrolet dealer tells me the steering gear torque sensor failed.  According to the dealer, the torque sensor can't be repaired.  The whole steering gear assembly has to be replaced.  The cost would be $2,066.29.  I will have to pay a return core charge if I want to keep the failed part.  Luckily, the steering gear torque sensor failed while I was stopped.  However, I had to travel several blocks and make several turns before I could get off the road.  Each turn required substantial effort and extra time and turning area. If traffic had been any heavier or going any faster, I could easily have been hit and had a serious accident while I tried to get my truck off the road.  I can't imagine how dangerous it would have been if this had failed while I was traveling at a higher rated of speed.  The dealer confirmed the torque sensor has failed and i have no power steering.  No one has inspected my part yet.  There was a recall of 60,000 vehicles in April 2021 of the Chevy Colorado model year one year earlier than my truck, 2015,  for the exact same issue.    There were no warning before the fail.  As I sat idling, I suddenly got a message on the screen that i had a power steering problem and driving would be dangerous.  That was the moment at which I had no power steering.",
