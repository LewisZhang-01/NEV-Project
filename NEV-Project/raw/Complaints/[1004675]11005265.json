AFTER FILLING MY GAS TANK AND PUTTING MY VEHICLE IN THE GARAGE FOR THE NIGHT I WENT OUT HOURS LATER TO FIND A PUDDLE BELOW WHERE THE GAS DOOR IS. IT WAS DRIPPING ABOUT EVERY 5 SECONDS AND THE GARAGE SMELLED OF GAS. I PUT A PLASTIC BOWL UNDER WHERE IT WAS LEAKING AND RAISED THE GARAGE DOOR UP TO LET SOME OF THE GAS SMELL OUT. THE NEXT MORNING I DISCOVERED THE DRIPPING HAD STOPPED.  WHAT WOULD BE THE PROBLEM OF WHY IT WOULD DRIP FOR A WHILE AND THEN STOP? THE CAR WAS STATIONARY ALL THE TIME OF THIS EXPERIENCE.",
