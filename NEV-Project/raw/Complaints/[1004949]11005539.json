THERE WAS A RECENT (MARCH 27, 2017) CLASS ACTION SUIT SETTLED IN CALIFORNIA FOR THIS EXACT PROBLEM. I HAVE ALL OF MY DOCUMENTATION FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE VEHICLE. THE MANUFACTURE HAS ADMITTED TO THE ISSUE AND EXTENDED MY WARRANTY ON THE TRANSMISSION, HOWEVER, THAT IS NOT SUFFICIENT AS IT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND I HAVE LOST SIGNIFICANT USE, VALUE, AND TIME RELATED TO MAINTAINING THE CAR TO FUNCTION PROPERLY.",
