I TOOK THE TRUCK INTO THE DEALER AND THEY GROUND THE ROTORS WHICH MADE THEM THINNER AND MORE VULNERABLE TO WARPING WHICH OCCURRED IMMEDIATELY. FORD REFUSED TO REPLACE THE ROTORS. THE PADS WERE FINE INDICATING THAT THE PROBLEM WAS NOT AN OPERATOR PROBLEM. I TOOK THE TRUCK TO AN INDEPENDENT REPAIR SHOP WHERE THEY CONCLUDED THAT THE ROTORS WERE NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THE VEHICLE. THEY REPLACED THE ROTORS WITH A MORE SUBSTANTIAL ROTOR AT A COST OF $1400 AND I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEM SINCE.",
