AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION I FOUND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY A $3000 CO-PAY DUE TO THE MILEGE AND AGE OF MY VEHICLE.  DISCOVERING THAT NISSAN HAD KNOW OF THE ISSUE SINCE 2007 AND I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN 2010 I AM QUITE UNHAPPY WITH LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS ISSUE PROPERLY.  IF FEEL THAT NISSAN HAS NOT DONE ENOUGH TO REMEDY THESE ISSUE FOR CONSUMERS.  I WAS DRIVING MY VEHICLE TO PICKUP MY CHILDREN WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURED WITHOUT ANY WARNING.  THE VEHICLE BEGAN TO OVERHEAT SPILLING COOLANT MIXED WITH TRANSMISSION FLUID ONTO THE STREET.  I MIGHT AS WELL BUY AND INSTALL THE TRANSMISSION AND RADIATOR MYSELF WITH THE CO-PAY THAT NISSAN WANTS TO CHARGE.  VERY UNHAPPY WITH WHAT NISSAN IS OFFERING TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.",
