        "summary": "THE REAR BRAKE PADS ON MY MAZDA CX 5 GRAND TOURING MODEL IS WORN OUT TO (0.2 PER DEALER) AT APPROX 34000 MILES. NOTICED THE PROBLEM WHEN THE CAR STARTED MAKING A GRINDING NOISE FROM THE REAR. BEFORE THIS THERE WAS A VERY STRONG VIBRATION OF STEERING WHEN BRAKING AT SPEEDS OF 55 PLUS MPH. THIS IS VERY UNUSUAL IN MY EXPERIENCE THAT A CAR WHICH IS ABOUT 2 YEARS OLD NEEDS NEW BRAKE PADS AND ROTORS REPLACED. MAZDA WEBSITE HAD SOME INFORMATION HTTP://WWW.CARCOMPLAINTS.COM/MAZDA/CX-5/2013/BRAKES/SERVICE_BRAKES.SHTML.     BRAKE ROTORS WERE REPLACED BY MAZDA AT 34000 MILES, NOT MY CAR IS AT 56000 MILES AND INITIAL SYMPTOM WITH THE STRONG VIBRATION OF THE STEERING WHEEL WHEN BRAKING IS REAPPEARING.     THIS SEEMS TO INDICATE AN INHERENT PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL PER INDEPENDENT MECHANICS.",
