A CHECK POWER STEERING LIGHT FLASHED ON THE DASH, I WAS UNABLE TO TURN THE WHEEL AND WAS FORCED INTO THE DITCH. I HAD MY BOYFRIEND COME GET ME AND DRIVE THE CAR HOME HE SAID THE STEERING WAS 4X HARDER TO TURN THAN A MANUAL STEERING RACK. I LOOKED UP THE ISSUE ONLINE AND IT CAME BACK TO 385,000 11-12 FUSIONS BEING RECALLED BECAUSE OF THE EXACT SAME ISSUE. I CALLED FORD AND THEY CLAIMED THIS VEHICLE IS NOT ELIGIBLE AND THE COST TO FIX IT WOULD BE BETWEEN 2500-3200 DOLLARS. IF THIS HAD HAPPENED ON A BUSIER ROAD MULTIPLE PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN INJURED AND FOR IS NEGLIGENT TO HOLD RESPONSIBILITY.",
