        "summary": "My 2015 Supercharged Range Rover Sport 5.0L V8 has unexpected rhythmic body movements while stationary. One side goes up and down then the other side goes up and down. This repeats every few seconds the whole ride, obviously more noticeable when stopped. You don't know if the dynamic system is working or not. It can push your car further in to the turn when it does it on a turn. If you are used to the dynamic system you may not be prepared for this issue especially since you don't know it is not working properly. This problem is reproducible, it does it every time I start my vehicle. There were no warning signs or lights that alert you that there is even an issue. It scares people who are not expecting the jolt when riding inside. More seriously it is a huge lawsuit waiting to happen because it is a tripping hazard when getting into the vehicle or out of the vehicle. It has the chance to raise up or down the moment you go to get in or raise and lower when stepping out. This is dangerous for anyone. Especially the handicap or elderly, they can easily miscalculate the height and cause them to lose balance, considering the whole car becomes unstable at the same time.  There was already a Land Rover Technical bulletin posted about this possible issue with 2014-15.My car exhibits this exact problem. My car isn't within that vin range. However, it's doing the same thing thats listed here, maybe there are more vehicles involved than they originally thought? I have a video to share, contact me for it since I cant share on here.  This is what the land rover technical bulletin said: Situation: A potential issue has been identified with the Dynamic Response valve block on certain 2014-2015 Range Rover Sport (L494) and Range Rover (L405) vehicles (5.0L S/C V8 only) within the listed VIN ranges. Unexpected body movements when the vehicle is stationary may be experienced due to the system self-test pulse resulting in pressure in the actuators which is normally isolate from them.",
