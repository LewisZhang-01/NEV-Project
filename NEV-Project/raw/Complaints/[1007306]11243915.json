THIS HAS CAUSED ISSUES WHERE MERGING INTO TRAFFIC FROM A STOP CAN BE UNRELIABLE, CAUSING ME TO FAIL TO ENTER TRAFFIC AT THE EXPECTED SPEED AND CAUSING INCREASED RISK FOR A COLLISION.  I THINK IT MIGHT BE A TRANSMISSION, SINCE IT FEELS LIKE A GEAR IS SLIPPING.  EVENTUALLY, THROUGH THE STUTTERING, I WILL GAIN ENOUGH SPEED TO WHERE IT STOPS BEING AN ISSUE.
