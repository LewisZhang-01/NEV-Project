WHILE SHE WAS OUT OF VEHICLE UNLOADING YOUNG CHILD FROM CAR SEAT, 6-YEAR-OLD BOY CLIMBED UP INTO FROM OF VEHICLE.  THE BOY WAS UNABLE TO REACH THE BRAKE PEDAL AND THE KEY WAS OUT OF VEHICLE (IN PURSE WITH WIFE).  HE WAS ABLE TO EASILY PULL ON THE AUTOMATIC SHIFT LEVER AND TRANSITION THE VEHICLE INTO NEUTRAL (AGAIN WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO REACH THE BRAKE PEDAL & NO KEY IN VEHICLE).  THE CAR ROLLED DOWNHILL AND PINED WIFE BETWEEN SIDE OF GARAGE AND VEHICLE.  LUCKILY, THE SHEET  METAL SIDE PANEL OF CAR DEFLECTED ENOUGH TO SAVE HER AND ONCE THE CAR RAN INTO SOMETHING IN THE GARAGE AND STOPPED SHE WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE.  WE ARE AWAITING MEDICAL ATTENTION BUT SHE HAS SEVERE BRUISING AND POSSIBLE CRACKED RIBS.    VEHICLE WAS FOUND IN NEUTRAL WITH NO KEY IN IGNITION.  AFTER STARTING VEHICLE (WITH KEY) REVERSING IT, PLACING IT BACK IN PARK, AND REMOVING KEY, THE ISSUE WITH THE SHIFT-LEVER FAILING TO LOCK COULD NOT BE IMMEDIATELY RE-CREATED.  VEHICLE IS AVAILABLE FOR FURTHER INSPECTION.",
