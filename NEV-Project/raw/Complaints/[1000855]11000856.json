ONE TIME IT HAPPENED WHEN THE TRANSMISSION FAILED ON THE 5FWY IN BURBANK WHILE DRIVING TO SAN FRANCISCO. ANOTHER TIME IT HAPPENED ON A TOLL ROAD IN IRVINE, CA WHERE I HAD TO GET TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE WARNING IS ALARMING AND TELLS YOU NOT TO DRIVE. AFTER THE RECENT HYBRID BATTERY REPLACEMENT I'M GETTING THE HYBRID SYSTEM FAILURE WARNING AGAIN AFTER I DRIVE IT FOR A LITTLE BIT AND PUT IT IN PARK. I'VE BEEN GOING TO THE TUSTIN HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP IN TUSTIN, CA AND THE ISSUE SEEMS DIFFERENT EVERYTIME, BUT I'LL NEVER RECOMMEND A HYUNDAI TO ANYONE ELSE GIVEN THE NUMBER OF FORUMS AND POSTS REGARDING THE 2012-2016 HYBRID SONATAS ENGINE ISSUES.",
