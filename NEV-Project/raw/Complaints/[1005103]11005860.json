DECIDES TO GO OUT THE OTHER DAY WHILE ON THE WAY TO CLASS (ON THE INTERSTATE ) AND I START TO SMELL SOMETHING BURNING, THEN TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE SMOKE STARTS COMING FROM THE VENTS!! I IMMEDIATELY PULL OVER AND HAD TO GET IT TOWED ! TOOK IT TO REPAIR SHOP TO BE LOOKED AT AND LEARNED THAT THIS IS A CONSTANT PROBLEM WITH THESE VEHICLES! APPARENTLY THIS IS WELL KNOWN AND THERE IS SOME SORT OF MALFUNCTION AND PEOPLE ARE PAYING THE PRICE BIG TIME FOR IT. I DO NOT THINK THIS IS RIGHT. I GOT THIS VEHICLE A MONTH AGO TO GET ME TO SCHOOL AND TO GET ME AND MY 3 YEAR OLD AROUND. I DO NOT HAVE 2K LAYING AROUND TO GET IT FIXED.",
