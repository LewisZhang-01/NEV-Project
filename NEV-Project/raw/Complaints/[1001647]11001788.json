I ASKED THE CSR IF THE RECALL HAD BEEN FIXED IN ADDITION TO THE VEHICLE BEING SERVICE, WAS INFORMED THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO REPAIR THE RECALL UNTIL IT FAILED. I WAS THEN INFORMED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF REQUESTS FOR THE RECALL AND THEY DID NOT HAVE THE PART TO COMPLETE THE REPAIR.     WE WALKED AWAY THINKING THAT'S WEIRD THAT SHE SAID THAT. IN CHECKING THE RECEIPT, THERE IS NO LISTING OF CHECKING FOR RECALLS, EVEN AFTER I HAD REQUESTED IT WHEN I MADE THE APPOINTMENT.",
