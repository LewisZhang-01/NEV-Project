I NOTICED SOME LIGHT WHITE SMOKE FROM THE BACK OF THE CAR AND MY ENGINE AND OIL LIGHTS CAME ON.  I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TURNED OFF THE ENGINE.  LOOKING UNDER THE CAR, I SAW 2 LARGE STREAMS OF OIL COMING FROM THE FRONT (PASSENGER SIDE, TRAVERSE MOUNTED) ENGINE (2.0 TURBO).  ATTACHED PHOTOS ARE TAKEN SHORTLY AFTER OF THE OIL SLICK UNDER THE CAR.  I CALLED THE DEALER AND THEY DISPATCHED A TOW TRUCK AND TOOK THE CAR TO THE DEALER (JUNE 27TH, APPROX 3:45 PM CST, ARRIVED AT DEALER 6:30 PM).  I JUST CALLED THE DEALER SERVICE DEPARTMENT AND WAS TOLD THE ENGINE WAS FOUND TO \"HAVE A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE ENGINE\" THAT WAS NOT RELATED TO THE OTHER RECALL NOTICES.  HE STATED THEIR WAS A BRAND NEW RECALL THAT JUST CAME OUT AFTER MY SERVICE DETAILING HOW TO INSPECT THE ENGINE FOR THIS NEW DEFECT.
