I WAS TOLD NO ONE IS SUPPOSED TO SIT IN MY PASSENGER SEAT UNTIL THE REPAIR PART IS INSTALLED. IT IS SIX MONTHS LATER, AND AFTER TALKING WITH THEM TODAY, THEY STATED THAT THE PART WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL DECEMBER. IT IS RIDICULOUS THAT I CANNOT HAVE ANYONE SIT IN MY PASSENGER SEAT FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. TOYOTA SHOULD MAKE THE PARTS AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE IN THE COUNTRY AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR LACK OF SAFETY TESTING.",
