THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT AFTER LESS THAN 4 YEARS AND AT 70K MILES.  IT SEEMS THAT THOUSANDS OF CONSUMERS HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE.  THE CAR WILL SHUTTER, JERK, AND SHUT OFF WHEN YOU ARE STOPPED/IDLE. THE CAR ALSO SHUTTERS WHEN ACCELERATING AND DOES NOT HAVE MUCH POWER.  THIS WAS AN EXTREME SAFE HAZARD WHEN I WAS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY.  THE CAR IS NOT SHIFTING GEARS PROPERLY/TRANSMISSION BROKE. NISSAN HAD AN ISSUE WITH THE CVT TRANSMISSION FOR MODEL YEARS 2006-2010 AND OFFERED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THOSE YEARS.  NISSAN SHOULD REIMBURSE AND/OR OFFER WARRANTY EXTENSION FOR 2011+ MODELS AS WELL.",
