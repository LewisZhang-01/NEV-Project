        "summary": "DRIVING MY CHEVY SILVERADO DOWN THE ROAD. HIT THE BRAKES FOR A DEER AND THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR. SMOKE STARTED COMING OUT FROM UNDER THE HOOD. FLUID WAS ALL OVER THE ENGINE AND ON THE ROAD. FOUND THAT THE METAL BRAKE LINE BLEW OUT.  TALKED TO 3 COMPANIES ABOUT REPAIRS. ALL THE LINES ARE ROTTEN. MINIMUM COST IS $500. ALL PLACES SAID THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH GM TRUCKS-EVEN THE DEALER SAID OH BRAKE LINES GO BAD ALL THE TIME ON VEHICLES OVER 10 YEARS OLD. I HAVE BEEN DRIVING FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS; OWNED AT LEAST 20 VEHICLES AND NEVER HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING.  IN CASE YOU DON'T KNOW IT-BRAKES ARE PRETTY IMPORTANT!  I WAS LUCKY. NO ONE WAS HURT. I WAS ON A BACK ROAD. I READ THAT GM USED LOW QUALITY MATERIAL FOR THEIR LINES. IF SO, IT SHOULD BE EASY TO BREAK IT DOWN AND VERIFY. WAS THIS METAL SUSCEPTIBLE TO CORROSION? THEY KNOW ALL THE CONDITIONS THAT THEIR TRUCKS WILL BE IN. HOW MANY MORE OF UNREPORTED ISSUES ARE THERE? SOONER OR LATER IT WILL BE PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT WILL BE LOST.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.",
