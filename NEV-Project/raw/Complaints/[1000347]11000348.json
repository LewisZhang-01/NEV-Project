        "summary": "LOSS OF POWER STEERING AT LOW SPEED.  HAD THE ENTIRE RACK REPLACED (PRIOR TO POWER STEERING LOSS), AS WELL AS THE POWER STEERING PUMP REPLACED (AFTER POWER STEERING LOSS AND COVERED UNDER THE TSB) AND WITHIN TO WEEKS OF HAVING THE POWER STEERING PUMP REPLACED,  THE EXACT SAME THING OCCURRED.  AT VERY LOW SPEED, IN A PARKING LOT, MAKING A RIGHT HAND TURN, I LOST ALL POWER STEERING AND HEARD A LOUD SCREECHING NOISE AS I ATTEMPTED TO MANEUVER MY VERY HEAVY SUV TO A SAFE AREA WITH NO POWER STEERING. \"SERVICE BATTERY CHARGING SYSTEM\" ERROR CAME UP ON MY IN-DASH SCREEN AND THEN IT WENT AWAY. I TURNED THE ENGINE OFF AND RE-STARTED WITH NO POWER STEERING STILL AND THEN RE-STARTED AGAIN AN THAT IS WHEN THE POWER STEERING WORKED AGAIN. THE ENTIRE TIME, THE RADIO AND LIGHTS WERE ON AND DID NOT FAIL.  I DROVE THE CAR DIRECTLY TO THE DEALERSHIP AND AFTER A FULL DAY OF HAVING MY CAR, THEY TOLD ME I NEEDED A NEW ALTERNATOR NOW AT AT COST OF $1200!!!! I'M NOT SURE HOW THE ALTERNATOR IS RELATED SINCE I DO NOT HAVE ELECTRIC POWER STEERING?!?!?!  I FEEL LIKE THIS DEFECT IS COSTING CUSTOMERS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR A DEFECT FROM THE MANUFACTURE AND GM NEEDS TO WAKE UP AND ISSUE A RECALL BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED!!",
