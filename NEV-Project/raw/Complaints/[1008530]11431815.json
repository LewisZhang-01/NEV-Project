With about 2' of play in locked steering wheel vehicle made it to road shoulder. Restarted vehicle 3 times but steering wheel remained locked. Put car in \"D\" and \"R\" successfully and vehicle would move normally but steering wheel remained locked. All other electrical and mechanical systems function normally. No warning lights on dash were displayed. Called LIthia Dodge in Bryan/College Station(where vehicle was eventually towed). They suggested disconnect battery for 15\" and system might reset. It did not. I disconnected Battery a 2nd time for about a minute. Steering still locked. Vehicle towed to Lithia where they willmlook at it Tuesday September 7, 2021.
