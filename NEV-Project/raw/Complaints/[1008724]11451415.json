My rear end was all over the place and has been getting worse when driving in snow and rain. This is putting my children life at risk especially since there's a recall on my vehicle and there's still no parts to fix it. I want a rental car until someone gets this issues fixed! Someone is seriously going to be injured or this problem and the recall that can't be fixed. I'm scared for my safety to even drive it in the snow or rain but I have to work. This is a huge issue and I'm not sure why this is still an ongoing issue",
