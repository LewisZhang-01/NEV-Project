HILLS ESPECIALLY CAUSE IT TO STALL. IT WAS SO BAD, I HAD IT TOWED. THE SCAN SHOWED A OXYGEN SENSOR PROBLEM. HAD THAT REPLACED. IT DROVE OK FOR AWHILE. IT HAS RESUMED THE STALLING. WHEN I READ THE RECALL, IT SOUNDED LIKE MY CAR WOULD BE INCLUDED. THE VIN # SHOWS IT NOT BEING ON THE LIST. PLEASE VERIFY BECAUSE IT CUTS OUT, ACTING LIKE IT ISN'T GETTING  FUEL. THE AREA I WAS IN WAS A COUNTRY ROAD WITH NO SHOULDERS TO PULL OFF ON.  IT ALSO HAPPENED ON A 4 LANE HIGHWAY.  IF IT IS NOT A RECALL, ANY SUGGESTION WILL BE APPRECIATED. THE EXACT DAYS IN SEPTEMBER ARE AN EDUCATED GUESS. THANK YOU.",
