I BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE DEALER BECAUSE THE CRANKSHAFT SENSOR FAILED AND ALSO WENT FOR THE BATTERY RECALL. DRIVING BACK FROM THE DEALER BACK TO MY APARTMENT WAS ABOUT 30-40 MINUTES. SO RIGHT WHEN I PULLED INTO THE APARTMENT PARKING LOT, I NOTICED MY TRUNK WAS SMOKING THROUGH MY REAR VIEW MIRROR. I QUICKLY TRIED TO PARK SOMEWHERE EMPTY, THEN I GOT OUT AND I SAW THE REAR END OF THE CAR WAS FLAMING UP. IT TOOK LESS THAN 20 MINUTES, THE ENTIRE CAR WAS COVERED WITH FIRE. SINCE THE FIRE STARTED FROM THE REAR, I AM SURE THAT'S THE BATTERY WIRE CONNECTION THAT CAUSED THIS. I AM FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I DD THIS CAR AND ONLY HAPPEN AFTER THE SERVICE FROM THE DEALER. ALSO WHY BMW DESIGN AND POSITION THE FREAKING BATTERY AND WIRES BEHIND THE GAS TANK?",
