I TOOK MY VAN TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SUGGESTED REPLACING THE STEERING SENSOR. WE REPLACED THE SENSOR AND THE PROBLEM PERSISTS. WITH NO CODES COMING UP THEY SAY THEY CAN'T FIX MY VAN. IT HAPPENS WHILE DRIVING AROUND CORNERS AT 35 MPH MOSTLY BUT HAS ALSO HAPPENED A FEW TIMES ON THE FREEWAY AT 70. ALL TIMES IT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR HAS BEEN ON DRY PAVEMENT. TOYOTA DOESN'T SEEM TO THINK THAT THERE IS REALLY A PROBLEM SINCE NO CODES ARE COMING UP ON THEIR CODE READER. DUE TO THE FREQUENCY OF THE ISSUE I AM HAVING IT COULD BE DISASTROUS AND END UP IN A HEAD-ON COLLISION. HOW COME THIS VEHICLE HASN'T BEEN RECALLED.  I HAVE INCLUDED A PHOTO OF MY SERVICE REPORT FROM THE DEALERSHIP. ALSO THERE ARE MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS IN DIFFERENT FORUMS REGARDING THIS SAME ISSUE AND AS FAR AS I HAVE READ THERE IS REALLY NO RESOLVING IT.",
