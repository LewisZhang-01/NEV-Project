THE WATER PUMP FAILED BECAUSE 2 OUT OF 4 BOLTS WERE NOT THERE.  THIS RESULTED IN THE PULLEY BENDING AND SEVERAL OTHER ISSUES.  IT WAS THE FIRST AND ONLY WARNING OF SUCH A PROBLEM.  I HAVE OWNED THE CAR FOR LESS THAN 1 YEAR (PURCHASED USED).  I WAS ALSO INFORMED THAT THE FRONT AXLE REQUIRES REPLACING (CLICKING NOISE).  RESEARCHING THIS PROBLEM, I FOUND THAT SEVERAL OTHER 2013 FORD ESCAPE HAD SIMILAR ISSUES.  MY QUESTION IS HOW FORD GOT AWAY WITH ONLY BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR REPAIRS ON LESS THAN 7000 VEHICLES.",
