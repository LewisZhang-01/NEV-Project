        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 2016 NEW MAZDA CX-5 IN OCTOBER 2016. MY CAR  WAS ONLY 5 MONTHS OLD WITH 5411 MILEAGE ON IT WHEN I EXPERIENCED THIS PROBLEM. I WAS PULLING UP MY DRIVEWAY WHEN I GOT IN FRONT OF MY GARAGE DOORS OF MY HOME, WITH MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE ABOUT READY TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK , THE ENGINE BEGAN TO REV UP TO A HIGH RATE OF SPEED AND ACCELERATED INTO MY HOUSE. THE HOUSE STOPPED THE CAR FROM GOING ANY FURTHER. MY HUSBAND WAS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT AND EXPERIENCED THIS AS WELL. I WAS PRESSING DOWN ON THE BRAKE, BUT NOTHING STOPPED IT. I WAS CLOSE DISTANCE TO THE HOUSE AND IT HAPPENED SO FAST. I BACKED OFF MY HOUSE. I HAD TO GET MY GARAGE DOORS REPLACED AND THE CAR FIXED. I DID NOT DRIVE THE CAR AGAIN. ONCE THE BODY SHOP FIXED THE CAR (DAMAGE $2300.00 DOLLARS), I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE MAZDA DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR TO INVESTIGATE THE PROBLEM. THEY DROVE IT FOR A FEW WEEKS WITH A BLACK BOX, BUT NEVER DETERMINED THE PROBLEM OR IT HAPPENING AGAIN. MAZDA CORPORATION WAS INVOLVED WITH THIS INVESTIGATION. I HAD FILED THE PROBLEM WITH THEM IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ACCIDENT HAD OCCURRED. I REFUSED TO DRIVE THE CAR AGAIN. THE DEALERSHIP (MAZDA IN MANCHESTER, NH) WORKED A DEAL WITH ME TO BUY THE CAR BACK AND GET ME INTO A NEW 2016 MAZDA CX-5.  I HOPE I DON'T EXPERIENCE THIS WITH MY NEW CX-5. I REALLY LIKE THE CAR, BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT WAS AN EXPERIENCE THAT NO ONE WOULD EVER WANT TO EXPERIENCE. I AM JUST GRATEFUL THAT I WASN'T ON A STREET AND IT HAPPENED TO MY OWN PROPERTY. IT COST QUITE A BIT IN DEDUCTIBLES ON HOUSE AND CAR AND I AM SURE MY RATES WILL GO UP ON INSURANCE ON BOTH. UNFORTUNATELY MAZDA COULD NOT PROVE THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE CAR, SO MY INSURANCE COMPANY COULD NOT GO AFTER THEM FOR THE DAMAGES. AS I SAID BEFORE I AM GRATEFUL MY HUSBAND AND I ARE OK AND NO ONE GOT HURT.  ALSO, I FOUND 4-6 OTHERS REPORTING THIS SAME COMPLAINT ON THE CX-5.",
