        "summary": "THE VARIABLE TIMING CONTROL ACTUATOR MAKES A LOUD RATTLING NOISE WHEN THE CAR IS STARTED IN THE MORNING FOR THE FIRST TIME.  THAT IS THE ONLY TIME IT RATTLES; THE FIRST START OF THE DAY.  THE MECHANIC SAYS IF THE ACTUATOR FAILS THE CAR WILL STOP WHEREVER IT IS.  IF I'M IN TRAFFIC IT COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT; I LIVE IN THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA WHERE TRAFFIC IS USUALLY HEAVY WHICH COMPOUNDS THE PROBLEM.  APPARENTLY HONDA IS REPAIRING THE VTC ACTUATOR ON SOME HONDA ACCORDS, BUT MY VIN IS NOT ON THE FIX LIST, SO HONDA RECOGNIZES IT IS AN ENGINEERING PROBLEM, AND IT IS WIDE SPREAD ENOUGH THAT THEY ARE REPAIRING SOME HONDA ACCORDS WITH THE RIGHT VIN.  THE INTERNET IS FILLED WITH HONDA ACCORD OWNER COMPLAINTS SO I KNOW THE PROBLEM IS HIGH IN NUMBERS.  THE OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL, STATE OF CALIFORNIA REFERRED ME TO YOUR AGENCY AND ENCOURAGED ME TO FILE A COMPLAINT.  I THINK THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM DUE TO AN ENGINEERING MISSTEP IN PLANNING AND PRODUCTION.  FURTHER I THINK IT POSES A SAFETY ISSUE FOR HONDA ACCORD OWNERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC IF THE ENGINE MALFUNCTIONS AS THE AUTO TECHNICIANS SAY IT WILL.  I THINK HONDA RECOGNIZES THE PROBLEM, BUT ARE ADDRESSING IT IN A PIECE-MEAL FASHION RATHER THAN ISSUING A RECALL.  I HOPE YOU CAN GIVE ME AND OTHER HONDA ACCORD OWNERS SOME RELIEF.  THANK YOU",
