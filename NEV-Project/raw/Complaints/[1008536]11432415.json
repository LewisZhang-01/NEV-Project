ONCE I TURNED OFF THE CAR, DID MY ERRANDS, AND RETURNED, THE CAR WOULD NOT START AGAIN. HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED TO MY DEALERSHIP AND SUBARU REPLACED THE ENTIRE BATTERY.  THIS CAR IS ONLY 15 MONTHS OLD WITH 3200 MILES ON IT. I WAS TOLD THAT I WASN'T \"DRIVING IT ENOUGH\" -- BUT WITH THE PANDEMIC, WHERE WOULD I BE DRIVING? SHOULD A CAR THAT IS SO NEW EXPERIENCE THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS ALREADY?",
