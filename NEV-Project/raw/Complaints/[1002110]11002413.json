HERE IS A CRASH REPORT  HTTPS://FORUMS.TESLA.COM/FORUM/FORUMS/MAJOR-AUTO-PILOT-SAFETY-ISSUE#COMMENT-1183233  MAJOR AUTO PILOT SAFETY ISSUE  SUBMITTED BY MELISCU ON JUNE 29, 2017    I HAVE (HAD) A 2015 P90 D. IT IS NOW TOTALLED AND I WANTED TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE WITH AUTO-PILOT.    MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF THE DEATH THAT OCCURRED LAST YEAR WHEN A TESLA DROVE UNDERNEATH A SEMI. IT WAS EXPLAINED AS HAVING TO DO WITH THE ANGLE OF THE CAR ON A HILL, THE LOCATION OF THE SUN . . . THE CAR SEEING UNDER THE TRUCK . . .    WELL, I HAVE RECENTLY HAD TWO EXPERIENCES, BOTH CALLED INTO TESLA, WHERE THE SENSORS DID NOT DETECT ENORMOUS TRUCKS THAT WERE STATIONARY, PERPENDICULAR TO THE LANE OF TRAVEL, AND ENTIRELY BLOCKING THE ROAD. IN THE FIRST INSTANCE AUTOPILOT WOULD HAVE DRIVEN ME DIRECTLY INTO A GARBAGE TRUCK. A GARBAGE TRUCK! AUTOPILOT SIMPLY DID NOT REALIZE IT SHOULD REACT TO A GARBAGE TRUCK BLOCKING THE ROAD. IN THE SECOND INSTANCE A BOX TRUCK MISJUDGED ITS TURNING RADIUS AND STOPPED PERPENDICULAR TO MY LANE. AGAIN, AUTOPILOT DID NOT RECOGNIZE THAT IT SHOULD REACT TO THIS ENORMOUS OBSTACLE, AND DROVE STRAIGHT INTO THE CAB OF THE TRUCK (ALMOST, I REACTED AT THE LAST MOMENT AND MANAGED TO AVOID THE CAB, DRIVING INTO THE CARGO AREA INSTEAD).    YES, AS THE DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE WE MAINTAIN RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT OUR VEHICLES ARE DOING. THAT SAID, WE PLACE SOME DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE THAT THE SOFTWARE THAT POWERS OUR VEHICLES IS GENERALLY IN GOOD ORDER AND ABLE TO PERFORM IN A BASIC SENSE . . . WHICH IS TO SAY RECOGNIZE MAJOR OBSTACLES AND SLOW TO A STOP.    IF YOU HAVE OR USE AUTOPILOT, PLEASE BE AWARE THAT IT APPEARS TO HAVE A MAJOR FLAW. IT DOES NOT SEE PERPENDICULAR TRUCKS BLOCKING THE LANE OF TRAVEL. BE CAREFUL. DO NOT PUT ANY RELIANCE ON THE VEHICLE TO BE AWARE OF THESE TYPES OF RISKS. MY VEHICLE IS TOTALLED.  PLEASE INVESTGATE.",
