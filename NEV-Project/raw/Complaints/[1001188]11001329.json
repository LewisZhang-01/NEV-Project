THE PROBLEM ON THE LETTER STATES THERE ARE PROBLEMS IN THE MANUFACTURING OF THE ENGINE, PRE-MATURE BEARING WEAR IN THE MOTOR AND THE BEARING CAN FAIL, AND VEHICLE COULD STALL WHILE IN MOTION, INCREASING RISK OF CRASH.      I AM TAKING THE VEHICLE TO HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP TODAY.  THE VEHICLE IS MAKING A KNOCKING NOISE FROM THE ENGINE THAT INCREASES IN FREQUENCY AS THE ENGINE RPM INCREASES.  I DRIVE THE VEHICLE ON THE HIGHWAY SO THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AND JUST STARTED TO HEAR IT LAST NIGHT. IT HAS STARTED TO REDUCE POWER WHEN GAS IS ACCELERATED AND RPM INCREASE AND HESITATION OF VEHICLE MOVING FORWARD WHEN PUSHING DOWN ON GAS PEDAL.      THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND I AM A MOTHER OF A 4 YEAR OLD SON, WE BOUGHT THE CAR ORIGINALLY FOR SAFETY.  I AM DISSAPOINTED IN THIS VEHICLE AS IT WAS UNSAFE FOR ME AND MY FAMILY TO DRIVE IN.  I ALSO UTILIZE THE VEHICLE FOR WORK AND IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE.  I WILL ALSO HAVE TO DEAL WITH FIGURING OUT TRANSPORTATION WHEN DEALING WITH HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP.      I AM UNCLEAR OF THE OUTCOME AT THIS MOMENT, BUT VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THIS VEHICLE.",
