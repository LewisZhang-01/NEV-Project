        "summary": "2012 FORD EXPLORER RELEASES STRONG  BURNT RUBBER SMELL WHEN I ACCELERATE OR REACH 3000 RPMS. IT IS GETTING WORSE THE MORE MILES I PUT ON MY CAR. CAUSES MYSELF AND MY 2 CHILDREN TO FEEL CAR SICK OR HAVE HEADACHES. THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET THE SMELL TO GO AWAY IS TO TURN OFF THE A/C OR HEAT AND ROLL THE WINDOWS DOWN. I HAVE MENTIONED IT TO LOCAL DEALERSHIP TWICE NOW AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS CAUSING IT BUT I'VE TOLD THEM ABOUT THE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AND THEY STILL ACT LIKE THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT. THE FIRST TIME I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR THE SMELL THE CAR WAS ALSO MAKING A NOISE WHEN THE A/C WAS ON SO I WAS TOLD THAT THE REPAIR THEY DID WOULD FIX WHATEVER WAS CAUSING THE NOISE AND THE SMELL. I JUST TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP TODAY FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND ONCE AGAIN MENTIONED THE SMELL AND THEY SAID THEY HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT A BURNING SMELL AND NOBODY HAS HAD THAT ISSUE THAT THEY KNOW OF. NOW THAT I KNOW IT IS LEGITIMATELY A CONCERN AND MY KIDS AND I AREN'T JUST ACTUALLY GETTING \"CAR SICK\" I AM EXTREMELY UPSET THAT I'M NOT BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY. I AM SUPPOSED TO TAKE THE CAR BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP MONDAY TO HAVE OTHER ISSUES FIXED AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT THEY TELL ME NOW THAT I HAVE MADE THEM AWARE OF THE LEGITIMATE PROBLEM WITH THE EXHAUST ODOR.",
