THE PRODUCT IN QUESTION IS A HYDRAULIC BRAKE LINE UNION, MANUFACTURED AND DISTRIBUTED BY AGS COMPANY AUTOMOTIVE SOLUTIONS, 2651 HOYT ST., MUSKEGON, MICHIGAN.  THE PRODUCT, PART NUMBER BLU-3 IS A STEEL UNION USED TO JOIN (2) 3/16\" BRAKE LINES WITH INVERTED FLARE SEATS.  IT IS WIDELY DISTRIBUTED IN THE AFTERMARKET AS WELL AS USED IN A VARIETY OF KITS THAT THEY SELL.  THE INTERNAL THREADS ARE MALFORMED AND NOT TRUE TO THE CENTERLINE OF THE FITTING.  ADDITIONALLY, THE SEAT AREA THAT BISECTS THE FITTING IS NOT CENTERED.  IT IS MY OPINION THAT THESE TWO NON-CONFORMING ISSUES COULD LEAD TO THE FITTING LEAKING OR WORSE DETACHING IN USE, LEADING TO A CATASTROPHIC BRAKE FAILURE.*DT  *TR",
