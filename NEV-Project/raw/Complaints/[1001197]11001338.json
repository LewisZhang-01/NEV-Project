        "summary": "I HAVE A 2005 MINI COOPER S WITH LESS THAN 85K MILES IT.  THE POWER STEERING HAS COMPLETELY GONE OUT. BEFORE IT WENT OUT COMPLETELY, IT WOULD STOP OCCASIONALLY WITH OUT WARNING WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE. THE PRIMARY IMPACT IS AS LOW SPEEDS, PARKING OR TURNING FOR EXAMPLE.  THIS VEHICLE HAS RUN FLAT TIRES MAKING STEERING AN EVEN BIGGER CHALLENGE.  IT IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND DUE TO THE HIGH COST TO REPLACE THIS FUNCTION AND SAFETY HAZARD IT IMPOSES,, THE CAR HAS BEEN SITTING FOR OVER A YEAR. THERE HAS BEEN A RECALL ON THIS SPECIFIC YEAR & MODEL OF VEHICLE FOR THE EXACT SAME ISSUE- HOWEVER IT DID NOT INCLUDE MY PARTICULAR VIN.  I BELIEVE THIS TO BE AN ISSUE OF EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS AND WOULD ASK THAT THIS BE LOOKED INTO IF POSSIBLE. THE MINI COOPER S IS A GREAT LITTLE CAR, HOWEVER STEERING IS A VITAL AND A REQUIRED SAFETY MEASURE THAT I FEEL MINI/BMW SHOULD GLADLY COVER IN ALL VIN'S DURING THIS TIME FRAME.",
