HAD INDEPENDENT SHOP CLEAR CODE IN 2015 INSPECTED HARNESS FOUND NOTHING OUT OF ORDINARY.  3 DAYS LATER AIR BAG LIGHT RETURNED.  NOW IN FEBRUARY 2018 HAD MINI OF TOWSON DIAGNOSE AIR BAG LIGHT THINKING THE DEALERSHIP CAN RESET AIR BAG LIGHT PROPERLY.  DEALERSHIP RECOMMENDED UPGRADING WIRING HARNESS UNDER SEAT FOR 525 DOLLARS.  I HAVE BEEN ON MULTIPLE FORUMS AND THIS AIR BAG LIGHT IS A COMMON PROBLEM FOR 02-03 MINIS, INCLUDING 05-06, AND 12-15 YEAR MINIS.  MY CONCERN IS THAT MINI KNOWS THIS IS A DEFECTIVE PART FROM THE MANUFACTURER BUT REFUSES TO STAND BY THEIR PRODUCT EVEN WHEN IT COULD AFFECT THE SAFETY OF THE PURCHASER OF ITS VEHICLES.  IN THE EVENT NHTSA RECEIVES ENOUGH COMPLAINTS TO FORCE MINI TO ISSUE A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE, I WOULD LIKE TO BE INCLUDED AS ANOTHER DISSATISFIED CONSUMER.    THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME,    GARRETT",
