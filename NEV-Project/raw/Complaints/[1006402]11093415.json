THE MOST RECENT INCIDENT WE WERE TRAVELING AT ONLY 45 MPH.  EACH TIME, AS SOON AS WE HEARD THE IMPACT, A HUGE CRACK APPEARED.  THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM WITH EITHER THE QUALITY OF GLASS BEING USED OR THE DESIGN.  WE HAVE CONTACTED SUBARU OF AMERICA AND REPORTED THE INCIDENTS.  AND YET, SUBARU WILL SAY THERE IS NO PROBLEM AND NO COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED.  WE ARE FRUSTRATED AND NOW ANXIOUS EACH TIME WE ARE TRAVELING THAT WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH GETTING THE WINDSHIELD REPLACED.  TODAY, WE AGAIN CONTACTED SUBARU OF AMERICA AND SAID WE WANT SUBARU TO ADMIT THERE IS A PROBLEM AND DEAL WITH IT.  WE ALSO MET WITH THE SERVICE DIRECTOR OF OUR LOCAL SUBARU DEALER AND FILED A COMPLAINT.  HE HAS AGREED TO FORWARD THE COMPLAINT TO THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR.",
