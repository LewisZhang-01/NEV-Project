There is no warning of an issue or any problem before the engine dies. This is the second occurrence of this on the truck. It has happened while towing a heavy load. Total loss of power, sterring and braking ability is a serious issue and a danger to the public as well as myself and my family. This issue needs to be resolved by Ford ASAP!",
