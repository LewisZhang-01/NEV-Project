LIKE THE PREVIOUS DRIVER COMPLAINT,  I AM FORCED TO PULL OVER TO RE-CLOSE THE DOOR.     I REPORTED THIS TO THE DEALER BACK IN 2012.  WE LOOKED TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY ACTIVE RECALLS.  NONE THEN AND NONE CURRENTLY.    SINCE THEN, THE DOOR POPS OPEN 50% OF THE TIME WHEN THE TOP IS DOWN.  THE CAR HAS NEVER HAD STRUCTURAL DAMAGE TO IT.  THE LOCAL AUTO BODY SHOP RECOMMENDED I POST TO THIS SITE.    I AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS POST: \"THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF SIMILAR PROBLEMS ON THE VOLVO FORUMS\" SUGGESTING A SYSTEMIC ISSUE.
