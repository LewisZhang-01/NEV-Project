THE CAR WAS A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE FOR A 2015 TOYOTA RAV4 XLE AWD THAT HAD NON REPARABLE ELECTRICAL ISSUES AND WAS REPLACED BY TOYOTA BY AN ARBITRATION DECISION.  THE FIRST DAY I DROVE THE CAR THE PASSIVE SAFETY SENSE SYSTEM ACTIVATED WHILE ON THE FREEWAY WHEN A CAR PASSED ME ON THE LEFT SIDE. LUCKILY NO ONE WAS BEHIND ME OR THEIR WOULD HAVE BEEN AN SERIOUS ACCIDENT. I TRADED THE CAR OFF 9 DAYS LATER AT A LOSS DUE TO COMPLETE LACK OF TRUST IN ANY TOYOTA PRODUCT. THE MANUFACTURER AND THE DEALER TREATED BE HORRIBLY ON THE PREVIOUS CAR THAT I WILL NEVER OWN ANOTHER TOYOTA AGAIN EVER.",
