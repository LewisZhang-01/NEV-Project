AT THE SAME TIME I LOST ALL BREAKING POWER, THE BREAK PEDAL WHEN ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR. I WAS ABLE TO SWERVE INTO A PARKING LOT AND THE BREAKS WORKED ENOUGH FOR ME TO STOP THE CAR. AFTER SITTING FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES I STARTED THE ESCAPE BACK UP AND DRIVE AROUND THE PARKING LOT, THE BREAKS SEEMED TO BE WORKING AGAIN SO I DROVE HOME.     I TOOK THE ESCAPE TO HENNESSY FORD IN ATLANTA GA, THEY REPORTED TWO ERROR CODES REPORTED INDICATING A FAILED HCU (HYDRAULIC CONTROL UNIT) AND A FAILED ECU (ELECTRONIC CONTROL UNIT). IT WAS EXPLAINED THAT THE ECU IS THE \"BRAIN\" FOR THE HCU. AFTER RESETTING THE SYSTEM AND TEST DRIVING THE ESCAPE, THE CODES APPEARED AGAIN QUICKLY. HENNESSY FORD QUOTED $4100.00 TO REPLACE BOTH THE HCU AND ECU.",
