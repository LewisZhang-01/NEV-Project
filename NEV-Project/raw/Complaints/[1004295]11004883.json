REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED 30 OCT 2013. IN MARCH 2017 THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE RECALL WERE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. THE SWITCH STARTED SMOKING AND THE LIGHTS WENT OUT. I NOTIFIED THE CLOSEST DEALERSHIP TO SCHEDULE THE REPAIRS FOR THE ITEMS TO BE REPLACED. THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT YES THIS IS THE ITEM COVERED BY THE RECALL BUT WOULD NOT BE COVERED AND I WOULD HAVE TO PAY. THIS MADE NO SENSE TO ME BUT AS I HAD TO DRIVE 80 MILES TO RETURN HOME I WENT AHEAD AND PAID. I CONTACTED HONDA AND EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM. THEY RESPONDED THAT THE PARTS THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED WERE NOW OUT OF WARRANTY AND THEY WOULD NOT COVER THE COSTS. IT SEEMS THAT EVEN IF REPLACEMENT PARTS ARE USED AND THE SAFETY ISSUE STILL HAPPENS AS IDENTIFIED IN THE SAFETY RECALL, THEY SHOULD COVER THE REPAIR COSTS. THEY FELT OTHERWISE.",
