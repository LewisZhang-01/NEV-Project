AFTER A QUICK SEARCH ON THE INTERNET IT SEENS LIKE MANY OWNERS OF THE 2.0T FROM THOSE YEARS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM. THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO REPLACE THE ENGINE AS ALL THE VALVES ARE BENT AND THE BILL IS OVER $8000, WHICH TOTALS MY CAR. MY CAR ONLY HAS 88000 MILES AND BAS BEEN FULLY SERVICE WITH PREMIUM FLUIDS ON ALL THE RIGHT INTERVALS. THE PROBLEM HAPPENED WHEN THE CAR PARKED FOR A WHOLE NIGHT AND WHEN I WENT TO TURN IT ON IT WAS CRANKING WITH A VERY ROUGH SOUND AND IT WOULDNT EVEN TURN ON; IT WOULDNT EVEN CRANK ANYMORE AFTER THAT. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS PROBLEM AS THOUSANDS OF CARS WITH THE 2.0T HAVE REPORTED THE SAME ISSUE. VOLKSWAGEN IS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE BUT YET THEY DON'T WANT TO ISSUE A RECALL.",
