        "summary": "HAVE AUTOMATIC BRAKING AND LANE ASSIST DRIVING. BRAKES ON ITS OWN WITH NOTHING IN FRONT. HAPPENED TWICE. DEALER CALLS IT A GLITCH. I CALL IT VERY DANGEROUS. POLICE OFFICER WAS BEHIND ME WHEN IT HAPPENED LAST. GOOD THING HE HAD GOOD REFLEXES AND THE SPEED LIMIT WAS ONLY 45 MPH I WAS IN THE CENTER OF MY LANE WITH NO OBSTRUCTIONS, NO VEHICLES COMING FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. TURNED OFF THE PROGRAM AND HAVEN'T USED IT SINCE. SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAID WOULD HAVE TO KEEP CAR AND TEST DRIVE UNTIL IT OCCURRED. I WILL DO THIS, BUT AM AFRAID THEY WILL BE KEEPING THE CAR FOR AWHILE BECAUSE IT HAPPENS OUT OF THE BLUE. IT'S HAPPENED TWICE IN A PERIOD OF TWO MONTHS. I HAVE HAD THE CAR FOR FOUR MONTHS. ANOTHER PROBLEM..PAINT IS SPOTTING ON CAR LIKE IT WAS HIT WITH ACID. HAD PROTECTIVE WAX PUT ON THE WEEK I PURCHASED IT. VEHICLE HAS 3500 MILES ON IT. PAINT ALSO SHOWS TONS OF ORANGE PEEL. I PAID A LOT FOR THIS MODEL. EXPECTED MORE.",
