        "summary": "IT BEGINS AT ABOUT A MONTH AGO.  THE CAR SOMETIMES COULDN'T STOP AFTER PUSH THE BREAK PADDLE. AND IT MAKES VERY LOUD \"GAGAGA\" NOISEWHEN IT FAILS TO BREAK. IT HAPPENED FEW TIMES ON LOCAL STREET, AND ONCE ON THE HIGHWAY. I TOOK THE CAR TO A DEALER YESTERDAY, THE  HONDA DEALER FOUND : IT IS THE BREAK MASTER CYLINDER FAILURE.   IF IT HAPPENED ON THE HIGHWAY , I WOULD BE KILLED  IF  I WAS NOT VERY CAREFUL, I WAS NOT VERY CAREFUL,   THERE WAS NO ANY SIGN OF THE FAILURE. EVEN THE HONDA SERVICE TECHS SPENT ALL DAY COULDN'T FIND THE PROBLEM OF THE CAR. I TALKED TO HONDA  USA, THEE REP TOLD ME IT ONLY OFFERS 3 YEARS WARRANTY .  I THINK, THIS IS NOT WARRANTY PROBLEM. IF IT FAILED WITHIN 3 YEAS AND PEOPLE WERE LOST LIVES ALREADY, REPLACE THE PARTS DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING. IT IS TOO LATE.  I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT HONDA MUST RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FAILURE AND FIX MY MY CAR WITHOUT COST ME A PENNY. AND CHECK ALL THE SIMILAR PARTS ON ALL THE CARS.",
