THERE ARE A FEW LEAKS COMING FROM MY CAR AS WELL I KNOW ONE LEAK IS DUE TO THE POWER STEERING AND THE OTHER THE FUEL TANK, THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER LEAK. MOST OF THE ISSUES I HAVE FIGURED OUT WHEN MY CAR WAS PARKED BUT SOME LIKE THE ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS AND FUEL ISSUES, I'VE NOTICED EITHER TURNING OR DRIVING ON THE MAIN HIGHWAY.",
