I'VE HAD TO GET VEHICLE JUMPSTARTED ON 4 OCCASIONS AND HAVE TAKEN VEHICLE TO A LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIP TO GET IT INSPECTED UNDER WARRANTY TERMS. THE DEALERSHIP HAS ONLY REPLACED BATTERY TWICE YET HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO PINPOINT PROBLEM. DRIVER SIDE DOOR LOCK/UNLOCK BUTTON ALSO HAS BEEN MALFUNCTIONING AND TEMPERATURE GAUGE HAS ALSO BEEN MALFUNCTIONING. I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HONDA FINANCE CORPORATION CASE MANAGER BY THE NAME OF KIA WHO HAS BEEN GIVING ME RUNAROUND ALONG WITH LOCAL DEALERSHIP, UNABLE TO SOLVE VEHICLE DEFECT/SAFETY ISSUE. THEY NOW SUGGEST I TAKE VEHICLE TO ORIGINAL HONDA DEALER OF PURCHASE WHICH IS A 4 HOUR DRIVE AND HAVE THEM REMOVE AFTER MARKET ALARM THEY INSTALLED WHICH MIGHT SUPPOSEDLY BE CAUSING ELECTRICAL PROBLEM. HOWEVER, IT IS SPECULATION AND DRIVING LONG DISTANCE IS A HARDSHIP FOR ME AND VERY UNFAIR. I FEEL LIKE LOCAL HONDA DEALER SHOULD FIX PROBLEM. THIS IS A HUGE CAR SAFEY ISSUE THAT HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED. YOUR ASSISTANCE AND GUIDANCE IS VERY APPRECIATED.",
