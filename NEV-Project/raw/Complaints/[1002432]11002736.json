ALWAYS ON A STRAIGHT ROAD WITH ALMOST A FULL TANK OF GAS. THE CAUSE A RELAY SWITCH WHICH IS SOLDIERED INTO THE MEMORY BOARD THAT CONTROLS THE VEHICLE'S BRAIN BOX THAT SHORTS OUT. AFTER DOING RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET, I AM BOTH SHOCKED AND DISGUSTED THAT THE NHSTA HAS NOT INVESTIGATED THIS FAULTY DESIGN BY FORD AND MADE THEM RECALL ALL OF THE 2003- 2008 EXPEDITIONS. YOU ONLY HAVE TO PULL IT UP ON YOU-TUBE OR GOOGLE TO SEE THE 1000'S UPON 1000S OF COMPLAINTS FROM EXPEDITION OWNERS CONCERNING THIS CONSTANT AND DANGEROUS PROBLEM, WHICH CLEARLY ENDANGERS EVERY EXPEDITION OWNER AND THEIR FAMILY. THE WORST PART OF THIS, THE FORD DEALERSHIPS WANT YOU TO SPEND $1000 OF DOLLARS NEEDLESSLY TO TRY AND DIAGNOSE THIS SAME, OLD PROBLEM, BEFORE THEY FINALLY DEAL WITH REPLACING THE ENTIRE FUSE BLOCK PANEL, JUST FOR THE RELAY SWITCH, WHICH IS THE CAUSE, THE SHORTING OUT RELAY SWITCH. THE INTERNET SHOWS AGAIN AND AGAIN, THAT THIS PROBLEM IS SO RAMPANT, THAT IT ISN'T IF IT HAPPENS, BUT WHEN, BECAUSE IT WAS A FAULTY AND DEFECTIVE DESIGN, WHICH ENDANGERS ALL EXPEDITION OWNERS MADE THESE YEARS. THE FAULTY FUSE BLOCK'S FUEL PUMP RELAY SWITCH BURNS OUT AND BETWEEN THAT AND THE THIN WIRES GROUNDING OUT UNDER THE HOOD, DRIVERS, UNSUSPECTINGLY ARE LEFT IN PANIC MODES ON THE HIGHWAY, SCRAMBLING TO GET OUT OF HARMS WAY, AS A RESULT OF YOUR VEHICLE TURNING OFF AT ALL SPEEDS, IE, 70 MPH. IMAGINE A SEMI IS BEHIND YOU AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE SAFE MEANS OF ESCAPING THE DANGEROUS PREDICAMENT YOU ARE NOW LEFT IN TO GET OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD? A RECALL IS NEEDED ASAP BEFORE TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE NEEDLESSLY KILLED AS A RESULT. EXPEDITION'S ARE FAMILY VEHICLE'S AND USUALLY HAVE LOTS OF CHILDREN IN THEM! THIS IS TOO DANGEROUS TO KEEP OVERLOOKING.",
