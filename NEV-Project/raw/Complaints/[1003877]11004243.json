MY LEFT REAR WHEEL SEAL WAS DEFECTIVE AND STARTED STARTED LEAKING FLUID AT 70,000. HAD TO REPLACE EVEN THOUGH I HAD EXTENDED WARRANTY.  CATALYTIC MANIFOLDS WENT BAD AND THEY KNEW IT WHEN IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY - BUT THEY DIDN'T REPLACE THEM.  PAINT PROBLEM WHEN THE TRUCK IS COLD - BIG GIANT SPOTS IN THE CLEAR COAT. THE MANIFOLDS MANIFOLDS NEED TO BE RECALLED BECAUSE THE EXHAUST IS ENTERING THE VEHICLE.",
