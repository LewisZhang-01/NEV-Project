        "summary": "ON JUNE 12TH, 2017, I PASSED OUT WHILE DRIVING AND HIT A PARKED PICKUP. I WAS TRAVELING AT 50-55 MPH WHEN I CRASHED. MY CAR PUSHED THE PICKUP BACKWARDS 33'. THE PICKUP PUSHED THE CAR BEHIND IT 8' THEN THAT CAR WAS PUSHED BACKWARD INTO ANOTHER CAR. MY CAR AND THE PICKUP WERE TOTALED.     MY SIDE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. I WAS SEVERELY INJURED. I SUSTAINED  5 BROKEN RIBS, MY LEFT WRIST WAS BROKEN ALONG WITH A BONE IN THE SAME HAND. I HAD A LARGE HEMATOMA ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY NECK AND A BASEBALL SIZE HEMATOMA ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY ABDOMEN.     MOST OF MY INJURIES WAS FROM THE SEAT BELT. THERE WAS AN ABRASION ACROSS MY NECK. THE MUSCLES IN MY RIGHT CHEST WERE PULLED. ALSO THE MUSCLES AROUND MY RIGHT BREAST AND UNDER MY RIGHT ARM WERE PULLED.     ON JULY 3RD , I HAD SURGERY TO REMOVE THE HEMATOMA ON MY LEFT ABDOMEN. IT WAS ATHE SIZE OF TWO FISTS. I HAVE WORN A WOUND VAC SINCE THE SURGERY AND HAVE 2-3 WEEKS TO GO.     I RECEIVED A BLOW TO THE TOP OF MY HEAD. I HAD A. RISE ON MY FOREHEAD AND ALONG THE BRIDGE OF MY NOSE.     I BELIEVE THE SIDE AIRBAGS SHOULD HAVE DEPLOYED. MY INJURIES WOULD HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS HAD THE AIRBAGS PROTECTED ME.     I'M REQUESTING THAT YOU INVESTIGATE WHO MADE THE PARTS FOR THE AIRBAGS AND WHY DID THEY NOT WORK.",
