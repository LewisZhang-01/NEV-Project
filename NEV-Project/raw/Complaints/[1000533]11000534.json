        "summary": "WHEN THE CAR IS ON A DOWN SLOPE AND YOU SHIFT TO REVERSE THE CAR WILL LEAP FORWARD AND ON AN UPSLOPE SHIFTING INTO DRIVE IT ROLLS FREELY BACKWARDS.  IN THE LATEST INCIDENT WE WERE ON HWY 101 IN HEAVY TRAFFIC WAITING IN A LINE IN A CONSTRUCTION ZONE  TRAFFIC DELAY.  WHEN WE SHIFTED FROM PARK INTO DRIVE THE CAR ACCELERATED BACKWARDS .  FORTUNATELY THE CAR BEHIND US HAD LEFT AMPLE SPACE.  IT ALSO HAPPENED PARKING ON A HILL IN SAN FRANCISCO AND FORTUNATELY THERE WAS ONLY A CURB IN BACK. THE MOVEMENT IS NOT LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IN A MANUAL SHIFT CAR.  IT FEELS AS IF IT IS ACCELERATING IN THE DIRECTION OPPOSITE TO THE INTENDED.  THE OTHER PROBLEM IS IN THE STEERING.  WE WERE ON A VERY TIGHT WINDING ROAD HWY20. DRIVING FROM WILLETS TO FT. BRAGG AND BACK AND THE STEERING WHEEL STIFFENED  AND RESISTED TURNING IN THESE TIGHT CURVES.  IT FELT AS IF THE POWER STEERING WAS FAILING OR THE STEERING WHEEL WAS IN DANGER OF LOCKING.  I  JUST TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALER TO FIX THIS PROBLEM AND WAS GIVEN A WARNING FROM CHRYSLER THAT THE  '(HSA)  MAY NOT ACTIVATE AND SLIGHT ROLLING MAY OCCUR'. THE ROLLING IS NOT SLIGHT AND IN HEAVY TRAFFIC OR ON MOUNTAIN SIDES JUST PLAIN DANGEROUS.  THE STEERING PROBLEM DID NOT MANIFEST ITSELF TO THE TECH.  THIS CAR HAS HAD A NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY DEADLY PROBLEMS. THESE BEING THE MOST RECENT.  IT TOOK THE RECALL, AFTER TWO YEARS AND FOUR TRIPS TO THE DEALER,  TO ADDRESS THE THROTTLE PROBLEM WHICH WAS TERRIFYING.  LOSING CONTROL OF THE THROTTLE ON A 8 LANE HWY IN HEAVY 75 MPH TRAFFIC IS HEART STOPPING.THIS CAR HAS SERIOUSLY FLAWED ENGINEERING.  CHRYSLER IS NOT ACCEPTING ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS LATEST PROBLEM.  THE CAR IS NOT SAFE.",
