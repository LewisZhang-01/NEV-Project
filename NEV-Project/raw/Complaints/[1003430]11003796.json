IT IS REGISTERED IN NEVADA AND I READ AN ARTICLE THAT GM IS SUPPOSED TO REPLACE THE FUEL PUMP BECAUSE OF A CRACK IN THE FUEL PUMP. MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP SAYS THIS DOES NOT COVER MY VEHICLE AND MY VIN NUMBER IS NOT ON THE RECALL LIST. THE FUEL MODULE HAS BEEN REPLACED ONCE FOR A LEAKING FUEL SMELL. I THINK IN 2011. THIS VEHICLE HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED AS HAVING A FUEL PUMP LEAK.",
