I WITNESSED CAR LOCKED ROLLING IN THE LOT AS I CAM OUT AND CLICKED THE DOOR LOCKS FROM DISTANCE OF 20 FT AWAY.  CAR ROLLED SILENTLY - COULD HAVE HIT ANYONE BEHIND IT IN THE PARKING LOT AREA - VERY VERY DANGEROUS!  MAZDA CLAIMS MY CAR  VIN NO. IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL FOR MAZDA 3 AND MAZDA 6S THAT HAS JUST BEEN ISSUED FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROBLEM - PARKING BRAKES NOT HOLDING.  I BEG TO DIFFER.  THE FIRST 2 TIMES THIS HAPPENED I THOUGHT IT WAS ME, BUT NOW AM CONVINCED CAR HAS AN ISSUE. HAVE DRIVEN STICK / MANUAL WITH PARKING BRAKE FOR 23 YEARS AND NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN BEFORE.  NOW, HAS HAPPENED 3 TIMES IN 2 YEARS. AM HAVING BRAKES INSPECTED AT THE DEALERSHIP LOOKING FOR CORROSION OR OTHER ISSUES THAT COULD CAUSE BRAKE TO NOT ENGAGE PROPERLY - NO MATTER WHAT MAZDA CLAIMS - THIS IS LIKELY A DESIGN ISSUE ON MY VIN NUMBER AS WELL.  RECALL IS 1217F - FOR VEHCILES 14-16.. ONLY THOSE WITH HAND BRAKES LIKE MINE.  MAZDA IMPLIED I DID NOT SET PARKING BRAKE.  I BEG TO DIFFER.  READ THE PART WHEN I'VE DRIVEN 2 STICK SHIFTS FOR 23 YEARS - WITH NO ROLL ISSUES EVER.  ALL 3 ROLLS OCCURED IN PARKING LOTS, WHEN I THOUGHT I HAD THE BRAKE SET.  I NOW LEAVE CAR IN FIRST GEAR AND USE PARKING BRAKES.  JUST TO BE SURE.  THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE.  OTHER VEHICLES SHOULD BE CHECKED AND OWNERS NOTIFIED.",
