I WAS HOPING THAT IT WOULD CORRECT THE FUEL RELATED DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLE CODES AND THE VEHICLE STALLING AND GOING INTO REDUCED POWER MODE. HOWEVER, THIS RECALL FAILED TO CORRECT THESE PROBLEMS. I HAVE NOW LEARNED THAT MY HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP IS FAILING. MY LOCAL BMW DEALER INFORMED ME THAT THIS VEHICLE DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR THE EXTENDED FREE REPLACEMENT OF THE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP BASED ON THE VIN EVEN THOE IT IS THE SAME N54 ENGINE THAT OTHER BMW VEHICLES HAVE THAT IS COVERED UNDER THE RECALL. SYMPTOMS, WHILE DRIVING MY VEHICLE ON SLIGHT ACCELERATION I GET A WARNING ON THE DASH THAT STATES \"REDUCED POWER MODE\" AT THAT POINT THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON AND I LOOSE POWER IN THE VEHICLE. AT TIMES THE VEHICLE WILL SHUT COMPLETELY DOWN WHILE DRIVING. THE VEHICLE HAS AN EXTENDED CRANK TIME AS WELL BUT ALWAYS SEEMS TO START.",
