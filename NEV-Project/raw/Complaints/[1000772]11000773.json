        "summary": "I HAVE A 2015 GMC YUKON WITH CONDENSATION IN THE RIGHT AND LEFT FRONT HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLIES. MY TURN INDICATOR STOPPED WORKING WHICH USUALLY INDICATES A BURNED OUT BULB.  I DID NOT NOTICE THE CONDENSATION AND I TOOK MY YUKON TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR WHAT I THOUGHT WAS GOING TO BE A SIMPLE BULB REPLACEMENT.  THE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLIES ARE COMPLETELY SEALED WHICH REQUIRES THE REPLACEMENT OF THE COMPLETE LAMP ASSEMBLY IF A BULB FILAMENT BURNS OUT.  THE DEALERSHIP POINTED OUT THE CONDENSATION AND TOLD ME THE BULB MALFUNCTION IS LIKELY CAUSED BY THE CONDENSATION. SINCE MY VISIT TO THE DEALERSHIP YESTERDAY, THE TURN INDICATOR HAS WORKED INTERMITTENTLY.  A CALL BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP WITH THE UPDATE AND THE RESPONSE WAS THAT THE CONDENSATION LIKELY CAUSED CORROSION AND STILL NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  THEY ADVISED ME THE OTHER HEADLIGHT AND SIGNAL INDICATOR WERE LIKELY TO MALFUNCTION AS WELL.   IT IS OBVIOUSLY AN ONGOING ISSUE SINCE GM ISSUED A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN AROUND MAY 2014 AND UPDATED IT IN MARCH 2016 TO INCLUDE 2016 AND 2017 MODELS. THE CONDENSATION COVERS THE ENTIRE LENS. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE AT NIGHT WHEN USING THE HEADLIGHTS.  THE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY IS NON SERVICEABLE - ENTIRE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY MUST BE REPLACED FOR NON-WORKING BULB AT A HUGE COST $1200/SIDE).  GMS TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN NOTES THAT IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE NOTED (SUCH AS IN MY CASE), THE REPLACEMENT OF THE LAMP ASSEMBLY MAY NOT CORRECT THIS CONDITION.",
