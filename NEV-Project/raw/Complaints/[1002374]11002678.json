WELL THIS WAS A SURPRISE TO ME. THIS HAPPENED SUDDENLY. FORTUNATELY I WAS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND NOT THE HIGHWAY. HONDA SAYS HAVE KNOW THE ORIGINAL ENGINE WAS FAULTY, BUT THAT I AM OUT OF LUCK REPAIR WISE. THEY HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS AND NEVER NOTIFIED ME. (THEY CLAIM SINCE IT WAS NOT A RECALL THEY DID NOT HAVE TO) I BELIEVE THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE AND DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY IT HAS YET TO BE RECALLED!
