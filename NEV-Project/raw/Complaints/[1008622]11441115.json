        "summary": "We have an rear entertainment center package in our 2022 Toyota Sienna van, when we pull the screen down it completely blocks our rear view due to screen is too big. I am wondering why Toyota didn\u2019t install digital rear view mirror to all trim levels with rear entertainment center, but they automatically install the to limited and platinum trims. To us that is an safety issue, for instance if there is a cop, fire truck or ambulance coming up behind us we wouldn\u2019t see them do to it blocking our view. I have a 12, 8 and 3 year old and everytime they get in van they want to always watch the rear entertainment center. Thanks.",
