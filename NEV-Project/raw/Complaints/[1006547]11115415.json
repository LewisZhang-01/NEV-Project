I WAS HAVING INTERMITTENT STARTING FAILURE FOR APPROXIMATELY 2 WEEKS. I WOULD TURN THE KEY AND THE ENGINE WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING, MOST TIMES I WOULD IMMEDIATELY TRY AGAIN AND IT WOULD TURN ON FINE. ONE TIME IT TOOK ABOUT 5 TRIES TO GET IT TO TURN. AFTER SPEAKING WITH MY MECHANIC AND PAYING FOR A REPLACEMENT STARTER, I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE FROM HONDA AND THEY SHOULD ISSUE A RECALL.",
