I DIDN'T HAVE A CRACK PREVIOUSLY AND A ROCK DIDN'T HIT IT SO THERE WAS NOTHING TO CAUSE THIS. THERE WERE NO OTHER CARS ON THE HIGHWAY AT THE TIME. THE CAR ONLY HAS 13K MILES SO THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN, BUT I'VE SINCE FOUND OUT THIS IS A KNOWN DEFECT WITH NEWER SUBARUS SO THEY SHOULD FIX THIS ISSUE BEFORE SOMEONE GETS REALLY HURT.",
