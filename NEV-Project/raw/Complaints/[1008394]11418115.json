        "summary": "My car has been automatically shutting off while driving. Bringing my car to a halt, not a full on stop but to the point my wheels lock up. Sort of like im slamming on my brake but I can't press my brake. I lose power steering, the entire car shuts off. Then I have to try and restart it, but it won't turn over. Sometimes its just for a few minutes. Other times Im stranded for hours. A few times its been days. After it dies and i turn the key off and then back on but not over ill have power. I have a kid and we've been stranded on an on ramp with cars going 60 all around us. The car just randomly shut off in the middle of the road. There's a lot of traffic around these parts and we were stuck, not even being able to get out of the vehicle with the cars going on each side of us. Ive done some research and ive seen thousands of other complaints about this issue since 2002. Ive had 3 different mechanics try to figure out what the issue was. Have had my car at the shop for weeks at a time. A few times even the mechanics couldn't get it started, and it had to sit for 3 days before it would start up again. The check engine light is on and all 3 different mechanics have fixed everything thats came up. After this started happening ive had to replace brakes and rotors several times. My car started shifting way to late. And feels like its starting to slip. This is a safety hazzard. Especially in larger cities.",
