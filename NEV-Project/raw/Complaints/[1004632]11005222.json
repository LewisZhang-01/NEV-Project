        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING MY 2012 CHARGER SXT, AND THE CAR SUDDENLY WENT INTO BATTERY SAVER MODE. I HAD PULLED OVER TO GOOGLE IT ON MY PHONE, AND MY CAR WAS STARTING TO DISPLAY THE SYMPTOMS IN THE P60 RECALL. THE BATTERY LIGHT CAME ON, THE TRACTION CONTROL, ABS, CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS, THEY ALL CAME ON. THEN AS I WAS PULLING INTO A PARKING SPACE AT DODGE THE CENTER SCREEN SHUT OFF, I LOST POWER STEERING, THE CAR SHUT ITSELF OFF. SOMEHOW THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS RAN A FEW CYCLES. THE DEALERSHIP INFORMED ME THAT MY CAR HAD A 180 AMPS ALTERNATOR, THAT IT WAS NOT PART OF THE P60. MY CAR HAD JUST REACHED 119000KM (74000MI), AND THE AVERAGE MILEAGE OF CHARGERS WITH 180 AMPS ALTERNATORS APPEARS TO BE AROUND 106000KM (66000MI). THE ROAD THAT I WAS ON, IT FOLLOWED THE A WINDING CLIFF. IF THE PROBLEM HAD BEEN MORE SEVERE I WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE DIED, EITHER GONE INTO THE ROCK FACE, OFF THE CLIFF, OR INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC. THE REPLACEMENT ALTERNATOR WAS OVER $800 CND, THAT'S BEFORE THE INSPECTION, BEFORE LABOR, AND IF THE BATTERY FRIED IN THIS ORDEAL, IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THAT EITHER. IT DOESN'T COVER THE RENTAL CAR I HAD TO GET.     OBVIOUSLY, CHRYSLER-DODGE-FIAT HAD TO DO A MASSIVE RECALL WITH ONE ALTERNATOR, IS IT REALLY A STRETCH TO THINK THAT THE OTHER ALTERNATOR THAT THEY INSTALLED IN OTHER VEHICLES WERE DEFECTIVE AS WELL? I LOOKED UP THE COST OF A REPLACEMENT ONLINE ACCORDING TO OFFICIAL DODGE SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE CHRYSLER 300 / CHARGER - THEY'RE LISTED AT ABOUT $200-250 CND, WHY IS THE ONE DODGE SELLING ME OVER $800? IS IT BECAUSE THEY REALIZED THEY HAVE TO PUT IN SOMETHING OF MUCH HIGHER QUALITY AND OUTPUT SO THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN?    THERE HAD BETTER BE A RECALL ABOUT THIS - PEOPLE WILL GET SEVERELY HURT BECAUSE OF THIS.",
