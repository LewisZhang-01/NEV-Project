        "summary": "TERRIBLE GAS MILAGE AND MASSIVE OIL BURNING. TOOK IT INTO O'HARE HONDA WHO REPLACED 2 OIL PRESSURE SWITCHES AFTER THEY UPDATED THE VCM SOFTWARE. I ALSO HAD OIL CONSUMPTION MONITORING DONE AND WAS TOLD MY CAR DOESN'T BURN ENOUGH OIL. IT WAS MONITORED TO BURN 9/10THS A QUART FOR EVERY 1000 MILES AND WAS TOLD IT NEEDED TO BURN AT LEAST A FULL QUART FOR EVERY 1000 MILES FOR HONDA TO OFFER AN ENGINE REPLACEMENT. FOR THE LAST 2 TO 3 YEARS I HAVE BEEN ADDING 2-3 QUARTS EVERY OIL CHANGE AND I USED TO GET 4000-6000 MILES PER OIL CHANGE WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED (CPO).     WHILE UNDER WARRANTY I MADE CLAIMS TO HONDA AND THEY WOULD TELL ME I AM USING THE WRONG OIL. THE DEALER VALLEY HONDA WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR SPECIFICALLY TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED TO PUT THE SAME QUALITY OIL INTO THE CAR AS THE PREVIOUS OWNER AND ACCORDING TO THEIR RECORDS THE VEHICLE WAS ONLY SERVICED BY THEM AND THE ONLY OIL TO PUT IN THE CAR WAS FULL SYNTHETIC 0W20 AND THAT IS ALL IT HAS EVER HAD. PLEASE NOTE OIL CHANGES EVERY 4K TO 6K MILES AT 80 DOLLARS EACH SEEMED GOOD, BUT NOW IT'S EVERY 2K TO 3K MILES AT THE SAME PRICE NOT TO INCLUDE THE ADDITIONAL QUARTS AT 10 DOLLARS EACH COSTING ME AN ADDITIONAL 20 TO 30 DOLLARS EACH OIL CHANGE AND I AM AVERAGING 13 TO 17 MILES PER GALLON CITY/HIGHWAY COMBINED A FAR CRY FROM THE ORIGINAL 19 TO 29 MILES PER GALLON PREVIOUSLY ACHIEVED AS PROMISED.     ALL SERVICES DONE TO THE VEHICLE INCLUDE: TIMING BELT REPLACED, OIL PRESSURE SWITCHES REPLACED, FLUID SERVICED AND FLUSHED; BRAKES, TRANSMISSION, POWER STEERING, COOLANT SYSTEM ALL OF THESE WERE DONE ON THE SAME DAY, WITH A HEAVY BILL OF 1300 DOLLARS. TIMING WAS DONE BECAUSE THE ENGINE OIL CONSUMPTION ISSUE AND BECAUSE I WAS TOLD THE VEHICLE HAD OVER 100K MILES AND IT WAS REQUIRED. CURRENTLY I HAVE 133K MILES MY 2008 ACCORD EX-L V6 NAVI.",
