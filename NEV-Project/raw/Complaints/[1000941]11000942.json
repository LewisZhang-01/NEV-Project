THE MECHANIC AT THE DEALER SAID RODENTS LOVE THE INSULATION ON THE WIRING IN THESE CARS. I FEEL THAT SOY BASED WIRING IS WHY THIS HAPPENED AND WAS NOT MY FAULT AND SHOULD BE COVERED BY TOYOTA.  MY CAR IS PARKED WHERE 3 OTHER OLDER VEHICLES ALSO PARK AND THEY DID NOT HAVE AN ISSUE. ONLY MY CAR WAS AFFECTED. THIS IS A MANUFACTURING ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE CORRECTED BY THE MANUFACTURER AT THEIR EXPENSE.",
