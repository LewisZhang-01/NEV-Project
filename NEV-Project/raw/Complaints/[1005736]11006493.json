BRAKE ISSUES FELT LIKE HYDROPLANING, BRAKE LIGHTS WENT ON (RANDOMLY) AND BRAKES IMMEDIATELY FAILED- NO PRESSURE, PEDAL TO THE FLOOR AND CAR DID NOT STOP. BRAKE LIGHTS OFF AND AUTO SHOP CAN NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG. SYSTEM IS LIFE THREATENING AND FORD SHOULD RECALL ALL CARS ESPECIALLY HYBRIDS TO REPLACE BRAKES. OBVIOUSLY THIS BRAKE PROBLEM ONLY OCCURS WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION! A CAR WITHOUT BRAKES IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.",
