        "summary": "\"TAKATA RECALL\"  FIRST OF ALL... TAKING SO LONG IN BETWEEN NOTICES ABOUT THIS ISSUE IS RISKY ISN'T IT??? I MEAN, YOU KNOW YOU'D HAVE A LAWSUIT IF MORE PEOPLE WERE KILLED OR INJURED BY THE AIRBAG DEFECT. SECONDLY, THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP THAT I CALLED AND SCHEDULED THE APPOINTMENT WITH GOT ME IN THE NEXT DAY (WHICH WAS GREAT), BUT THEY FAILED TO REALIZE THAT THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE RIGHT PART FOR MY PARTICULAR CAR! I DROVE ALMOST AN HOUR THERE, WASTED AN HOUR THERE AND THEN THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE SORRY AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT PART. THEY ASKED IF I COULD BRING IT BACK TOMORROW OR LEAVE IT OVERNIGHT, BUT WHEN I ASKED IF THEY'D GIVE ME SOMETHING TO DRIVE THEY SAID THEY DON'T DO THAT... SO, SOMEONE DROPPED THE BALL! WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MY AIRBAG AND SOMEONE WAS INJURED OR KILLED? SCOTT WILL TOYOTA OF SUMTER SOUTH CAROLINA IS THE NAME OF THE DEALERSHIP BY THE WAY. I WILL FIND ANOTHER DEALERSHIP AND TELL THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT PART FIRST (BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT'S MY JOB AS THE CUSTOMER TO PAY FOR YOUR SCREWUPS!!) FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME, THANKS!",
