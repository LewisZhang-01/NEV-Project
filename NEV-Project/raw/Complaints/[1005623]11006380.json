ONE HONDA (2010) HAD A CAMPAIGN  SO IT WAS FIXED AS PART OF RECALL. OTHER HONDA (2003) DID NOT HAVE CAMPAIGN SO HONDA IS NOT OFFERING THE FIX FOR MANUFACTURING DEFECT RELATED PROBLEM.  THIS DEFECT IS DUE TO THE INCORRECT OIL SEAL USED IN THE HONDA AND THEY ARE NOT FIXING AND CREATING THE RISK FOR DRIVERS.",
