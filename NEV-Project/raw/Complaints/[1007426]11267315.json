FIRST REMOTE CONTROL WOULD NOT OPEN DOORS, AFTER SEVERAL TRIES IT OPEN THE DRIVER DOOR ONLY, UPON TURNING IGNITION ON A SERIES OF WARNING INDICATING THE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY DISABLES ITSELF, ALL COLLISION MITIGATION FUNCTIONS STOP WORKING, SERIES OF WARNING SEE PICS APPEAR ON DISPLAY TO SEE DEALER, ALL WINDOWS AND TRUCK WILL NOT FUNCTION, TURN SIGNALS AND BRAKE LIGHTS, REAR VIEW CAMERA DO NOT FUNCTION, BRAKE SYSTEM MSG APPEARS ON DISPLAY.  TURNED OFF AND ON CAR WITH NO SUCCESS IN RESTORING ALL FUNCTIONS AS ON TWO PREVIOUS OCCASIONS. DROVE CAR FOR 4 MILES IN THIS STATE FELT IT WAS DANGEROUS FOR US AND OTHER DRIVERS.  THIS MORNING ALL HAS RESTORED TO NORMAL.  CALLED HONDA DEALER IN EL MONTE CA.  WAS TOLD THEY DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM, WAS NOT ABLE TO BOOK SERVICE CALL UNTIL MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK   IN RESEARCHING ONLINE FOUND HONDA SERVICE BULLETIN 19-051 DESCRIBING A SOFTWARE UPDATE TO CAR MODULES TO FIX THIS PROBLEM.  I BELIEVE THAT IS REALLY SHOULD MERIT A RECALL AS IT INTERFERES WITH THE SAFE DRIVING OF THE VEHICLE.  A RECALL WILL FORCE HONDA TO INFORM ITS SERVICE DEALERS AND INSTRUCT THEM ON A PROMPT SCHEDULING OF REQUIRED SOFTWARE UPGRADE TO RESOLVE THIS SOFTWARE DEFECT AFFECTING DRIVABILITY OF THEIR FLAGSHIP CAR.",
