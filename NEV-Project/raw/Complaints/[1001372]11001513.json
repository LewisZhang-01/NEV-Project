I WAS NOTIFIED BY LETTER IN MARCH OF 2016 THAT MY SAAB WAS PART OF THE TAKATA AIRBAG RECALL AND THAT I WOULD BE NOTIFIED WHEN AND WHERE TO TAKE MY CAR FOR AIR BAG REPLACEMENT.  I WAS ALSO NOTIFIED IN THAT LETTER THAT PARTS WERE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND I WOULD BE NOTIFIED WHEN THEY WERE AVAILABLE AND WHAT SERVICE CENTER I WOULD NEED TO TAKE THE CART TO FOR REPAIRS.  SOMETIME IN APRIL 2017, I WAS NOTIFIED THAT DORITO BROS SAAB, IN WALNUT CREEK, CALIFORNIA WOULD BE DOING THE AIR BAG REPLACEMENT AND I WOULD LIKELY BE CONTACTED WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH ABOUT SCHEDULING THE REPAIRS.  I DID NOT HEAR BACK AND I TRIED TO CONTACT DORITO BROS. SAAB AND IT APPEARS THEY ARE NO LONGER IN BUSINESS.  I TRIED CALLING THE \"TOLL-FREE VEHICLE SAFETY HOTLINE, (1.888.327.4236 OR 1.800.424.9153) AND HAVE GOT NOTHING BUT A BUSY SIGNAL.  WHAT SHOULD I DO ABOUT GETTING THE AIRBAG REPLACED IN MY 2006 SAAB 93?  THE CAR IS OUR MAIN SOURCE OF TRANSPORTATION.",
