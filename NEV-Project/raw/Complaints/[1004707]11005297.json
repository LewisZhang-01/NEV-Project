        "summary": "MY SEVEN MONTH PREGANT FIANC AND I ENTERED THE VEHICLE AND BEFORE STARTING THE TRUCK THE PASSENGER SIDE (AHR) HEADREST DEPLOYED WITHOUT PROVOCATION. THERE WAS NO ACCIDENT TO CAUSE IT TO DEPLOY AND DURING THE INCIDENT IT STRUCK HER IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD. WHEN THIS HAPPENED SHE NEARLY HAD A PANIC ATTACK HAVING BEEN STARTLED. THE BROKEN PIECES FROM THE HEADREST FLEW OUT AND LANDED IN THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE. HAD SOMEBODY OR MY CHILD BEEN IN THE REAR SEAT THEY WOULD'VE BEEN SHOWERED WITH PIECES AS THE HEADREST EXPLODED FOR NO APPARENT REASON. CALLED CHRYSLER AND THEY WILL NOT COVER THE REPAIRS BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS 600 MILES OVER THE BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY. THIS BEING A SAFETY ISSUE IT REALLY BOGGLES ME WHY I AM LIABLE TO PAY FOR DAMAGES. THIS ISN'T A NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR DEAL WITH THE VEHICLE, THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. NOW THAT THE HEADREST HAS EXPLODED SHE IS EVEN MORE IN DANGER RIDING IN THE SEAT, THE HEADREST BEING APART CAUSES HER TO ADJUST HOW SHE SITS IN THE VEHICLE INCLUDING HOW SHE HOLDS HER HEAD. IF THERE IS A REAR-END COLLISION MY FEAR IS THE MALFUNCTIONED PIECE OF SAFETY EQUIPMENT WILL CAUSE MORE DAMAGE THAN HELP. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE CUSTOMERS RIDING WITH MALFUNCTIONING HEAD RESTRAINTS.",
