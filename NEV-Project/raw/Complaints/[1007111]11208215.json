        "summary": "IN THE PAST TWO YEARS I'VE HAD TO DISCONNECT BATTERY SEVERAL TIMES BECAUSE WIPERS WOULD CONTINUOUSLY TURN ON AND LIGHTS ON AND NOT SHUT OFF. AIR CONDITIONER STOPPED WORKING OUT OF NO WHERE AFTER IT HAD BEEN PROFESSIONALLY REFILLED JUST A YEAR AGO. SINCE I PURCHASE THE VEHICLE FROM A USED CAR DEALER 3 YEARS AGO, THE POWER TRAIN FEELS LIKE IT PULLS ON TAKE OFF ALSO MAKES AN AIRPLANE LIKE NOISE AND AFTER PICKING UP CERTAIN SPEED IT THEN DRIVES NORMAL. ONCE IN A WHILE ON ACCELERATION IT FEELS LIKE IT LOOSE SPEED OR STALLS. ENGINE LIGHT WENT ON WITH CODE P0507 WHICH CAN BE ANY ISSUE PERTAINING TO HIGHER FUEL PRESSURE. I JUST REPLACED BATTERY LAST MONTH AND DECIDED TO PUT A MORE POWERFUL ONE TO SEE IF MAYBE ISSUES WOULD RESOLVED BUT IT DID NOT HELP. ABOUT 2 DAYS AGO I GOT THE AIR BAG LIGHT TURN ON. WHEN I PURCHASE VEHICLE THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THE DRIVE SHAFT HEAT SHIELD. I TOOK VEHICLE TO DEALER TO RESOLVE RECALL AND AT THE SAME TIME I MENTIONED CONCERNING HOW THE VEHICLE FELT AND THE HISSING SOUND LIKE AN AIRPLANE TAKING OFF WHEN FIRST ACCELERATING. DODGE DEALER ADVISED STATED THAT THERE WAS A COMPUTER (PCM) UPDATE THAT INCLUDES SOME OF THE ISSUES MENTIONED BUT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY. I FOUND IT FUNNY THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY CLAIM RESOLVES KNOWN ISSUES BUT I WENT AHEAD AND PAID FOR IT SPECIFICALLY SINCE IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA THERE IS NO LEMON LAW WHEN PURCHASING A USED VEHICLE IS PURCHASED AS IS AND I'LL GO AHEAD AND TO MENTIONED THE LOAN WHICH DID NOT ALLOW ME TO BARGAIN BECAUSE THEY CLAIM TO HAVE TO USED BOOK VALUE. TOO BAD FOR DODGE NOT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THE CAR HAS GOOD POWER WHEN ITS IN WORKING CONDITION AND IT IS A GOOD LOOKING CAR PLUS ROOMY FOR A SMALL SUV; HOWEVER, A DEALER THAT DOES NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THERE FAULT IS ONE TO STAY AWAY FROM.",
