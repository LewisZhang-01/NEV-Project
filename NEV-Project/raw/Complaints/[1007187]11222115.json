THIS ALSO FREQUENTLY IMPACTS MY TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY, STEREO, AND A/C/HEAT, AS NOTHING WILL TURN ON, LIGHT UP, OR WORK. THE ISSUE BEGAN A FEW RANDOM TIMES WHEN I FIRST STARTED MY VEHICLE AROUND 6/12/19, BUT EVERYTHING WOULD RESOLVE ITSELF WITHIN 1-2 MINUTES OF DRIVING. WITHIN A FEW WEEKS, THE ISSUE STARTED OCCURRING MORE FREQUENTLY AND NOW THE INSTRUMENT PANEL WILL SOMETIMES SHUT OFF WHILE DRIVING STRAIGHT, TURNING, ETC. I AM STILL ABLE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE WITH NO ISSUES, FOR NOW, BUT I AM UNABLE TO SEE IMPORTANT SAFETY FEATURES SUCH AS THE SPEEDOMETER OR WARNING LIGHTS.",
