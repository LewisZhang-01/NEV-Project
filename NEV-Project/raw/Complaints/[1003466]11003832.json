THIS USUALLY  HAPPENS WHILE ACCELERATING ON HIGHER SPEED ROADS AND HIGHWAYS AT HIGHER SPEEDS, USUALLY 40-70 MPH RANGE AND MOSTLY WHEN ON A LONG TRIP W/O STOPPING, EXCEPT FOR GAS. CAR IS ALWAYS IN MOTION AND THERE IS NO CHANGE IN ENGINE TEMP AND NO WARNING LIGHTS LIT.THIS PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED MANY TIMES IN THE PAST 18 MONTHS.  THE DATE INDICATED WAS THE MOST RECENT DATE.",
