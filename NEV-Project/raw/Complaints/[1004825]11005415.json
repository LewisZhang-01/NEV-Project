        "summary": "\"TAKATA RECALL\"  I TOOK THE DURANGO TO ORANGE COAST DODGE IN COSTA MESA TO FIX THE RECALL. THEY INSERTED A DIAGNOSTIC DEVICE THAT SHOWED THAT THE AIR BAG SYSTEM WAS OFF LINE. NO WARNING LIGHT WAS SHOWING ON THE DASH. WHEN STARTING THE VEHICLE THE AIRBAG LIGHT AND THE RESTRAINT SYSTEM INDICATORS ON THE DASH LIGHT UP FOR A FEW SECONDS THEN GO OFF. THE DEALER RAN A DIAGNOSTICS AND FOUND THAT THE AIRBAG SYSTEM WAS NOT INITIALIZED AND THAT THE WARNING LIGHT DOES NOT COME ON BECAUSE THE VEHICLE COMPUTER CANNOT CONNECT TO THE SYSTEM. HE SAID ITS AS IF THE SYSTEM IS NOT INSTALLED. THE SERVICE ASSOCIATE SAID THAT HE'S SEEN THIS BEFORE AND DOESN'T KNOW FOR SURE HOW IT HAPPENS - MAYBE A VOLTAGE SPIKE OR BATTERY ISSUE. THEY PERFORMED THE RECALL, INITIALIZED THE SYSTEM, TESTED AND SAY EVERYTHING WORKS. COST ME $155. HOW WILL I KNOW FOR SURE THAT MY AIRBAGS ARE ONLINE IF THE INDICATORS DON'T SHOW ME?    I HAD A FRONT END COLLISION IN THE VEHICLE IN 2015 AND THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY - SEE ATTACHED PHOTO. AFTER THE COLLISION THE TRANSFER CASE MOTOR WAS STUCK IN 4 WHEEL DRIVE MODE EVEN THOUGH THE SWITCH IS IN AWD POSITION. AT NO TIME HAVE I SEEN ANY INDICATOR ON THE DASH THAT SHOWS THE AIR BAGS OR RESTRAINT SYSTEM NOT WORKING.",
