        "summary": "Hi. I was driving to go shopping like I normally do speed limit was 45 mph. All of a sudden I noticed I was getting very close to the medium the 8-inch cement medium. I tried to turn the wheel more to the right but it was very hesitant and hard to do I ended up hitting the medium and it damaged the rear rim on that wheel and the tire afterwards just made a loud thumping noise it was a very scary situation. It was then I noticed it said power steering lit up on the dashboard nitro it back home and then the light on off and the steering was okay again which was very scary and strange it happened one more time when I was turning the corner and I almost hit someone because I could not turn the wheel like it normally turned it took a lot of effort this is a very scary situation as this is the only vehicle I have for transportation it's not normal do you have the steering just instantly either stop or is very hard to turn. Thank you",
