IN JANUARY 2017 I GOT A LETTER ABOUT THE DEFECTIVE AIRBAG THAT STATED DO NOT LET ANYONE RIDE IN PASSENGER SEAT. THIS IS A FAMILY CAR, MY ONLY FAMILY CAR, I CANNOT INDEFINETLY NOT HAVE PASSANGERS IN MY CAR. THE 2015 RECALL INVOLVES A WINDOW ISSUE THAT CAN CAUSE A FIRE. THE WINDOWS WORK BUT SQUEAKS AND HAS RUB MARKS ON THE GLASS. TOYOTA HAS HAD AMPLE TIME TO FIX BOTH ISSUES. HOW LONG HAS THIS AIRBAG PROBLEM BEEN? SEVERAL YEARS AT LEAST AND NOW THE AIRBAG MANUFACTURER HAS GONE BANKRUPT. I PAID FOR A FULLY FUNCTIONING CAR YET I CAN'T PUT ANYONE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT?!?!",
