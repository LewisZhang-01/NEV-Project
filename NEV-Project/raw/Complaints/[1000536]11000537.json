THERE WAS SO MUCH RUST AND CORROSION THAT THE SHIMMY AND PULL AND LUNGING WE FELT WAS THE WEIGHT OF THE MOTOR COMING LOOSE! THE FACT THAT THIS HAS BEEN A RECALL ON CHRYSLER PACIFICAS OF ADJACENT YEARS AND DUE TO THE NUMBER OF ONLINE COMPLAINTS WE FOUND WHEN SEARCHING FOR A RECALL SHOULD BE ENOUGH OF A REASON FOR CHRYSLER TO APPLY A RECALL BUT APPARENTLY THEY WANT TO WAIT UNTIL PEOPLE DIE BECAUSE THEIR ENGINE FALLS OUT OF THEIR CAR GOING 70 MPH ON A HIGHWAY. WE ENDED UP PAYING ABOUT $2500 TO HAVE IT FIXED. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. A SAFETY ISSUE LIKE THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH YEARS AGO.",
