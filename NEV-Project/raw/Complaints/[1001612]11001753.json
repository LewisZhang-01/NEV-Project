WHENEVER I ROLL MY SIDE WINDOWS DOWN AND UP THE BLACK RUBBER HAS MELTED AND IT LEAVES BLACK STREAKS ON MY WINDOWS. THE RUBBER STARTED TO FLAP IN THE WIND FROM UNDER THE METAL SEALS ON ALL FOUR DOORS OVER A YEAR AGO.  MY RUBBER SEAL AROUND MY WINDSHIELD IS ALSO MELTING. I WASH MY CAR AND CANNOT DRY THE TOP ANY LONGER DUE TO THE RUBBER MELTING ONTO THE PAINT. THE SUNROOF AND BACK HAVE NOT STARTED YET.    I HAVE PURCHASED SEVERAL NEW CARS PRIOR TO PURCHASING THE HONDA -NEW. I'VE ALSO PURCHASED 3 USED CARS BEFORE, I'VE KEPT CARS OVER 15 YEAR ; NONE EVER HAVE HAD THE RUBBER SEAL MELT. MY HUSBAND WAS TOLD BY A MECHANIC \"THAT HAS BEEN A PROBLEM\".",
