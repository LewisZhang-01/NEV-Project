EVERY LITTLE BUMP CAUSES IT TO SHAKE . THE BRACKET ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH THE PLASTIC AND THERE IS A HOLE INSIDE THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE. I SEE SO MANY IDENTICAL COMPLAINTS AND ITS VERY DISAPPOINTING THAT FORD HAS DONE NOTHING TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. I KNOW THAT THE FORD ESCAPE 2001- 2004 WERE RECALLED FOR THIS EXACT ISSUE AND ITS DISCONCERTING THAT THEY ARE IGNORING THE SAME PROBLEM FOR THE 2005-2008 ESCAPE. HOW MANY MORE THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS IS IT GOING TO TAKE FOR THEM TO AT LEAST INVESTIGATE THIS UNSAFE, REOCCURRING ISSUE?! HOPEFULLY , SOMETHING WILL BE DONE SOON BEFORE SOMEONE GETS SERIOUSLY INJURED.",
