        "summary": "My wife and I have a 2012 Dodge Grand Caravan, my wife drives the car on a daily basis school runs, etc with our 4 kids. While driving the kids to school and stopped at a red light the vehicle suddenly with no warning lost all power and shutdown. My wife said she was able to restart it again right away, then just before she got home the car suddenly and again no warning shut down everything no power whatsoever she was unable to remove the key from the ignition. After attaching a battery pack we were able to get it restarted and drive home Thankfully no one was behind her at the time as it would most definetly have resulted in a crash. Since then this has occured several more times sometimes it will be a day or couple days but it will always just die with no warning, My wife refuses to drive the car now as both she and I are afraid for the kids and her safety. I have checked and fixed various items including a new battery,alternator and ASD relay all of which did not fix the issue. I see dodge has issued recalls for the ignition switch on previous years. I believe Dodge needs to look at the 2012 and fix whatever this issue is as I have saw numerous people experiencing the same issue. I am a father supporting my wife and 4 kids and cannot afford a bottomless pit of maybe its this/that. Dodge needs to step up it could be the difference of saving someones life.",
