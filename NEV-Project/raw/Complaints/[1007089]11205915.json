        "summary": "I BOUGHT A BRAND NEW 2018 JEEP RENEGADE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 2,500 MILES THE CAR WOULD SHUT OFF ON ME WHILE DRIVING.  NO WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON.  IT SHUT OFF TWICE WHILE DRIVING STRAIGHT AND TWICE WHILE MAKING LEFT HAND TURNS.  AFTER THE FIRST TIME IT SHUT OFF, IT DIDN'T HAVE THE PICKUP IT HAD BEFORE AND SEEMED TO SPUTTER.    I TOOK IT TO A JEEP DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THAT I WAS OUT OF OIL.  THEY TOPPED IT OFF AND SENT ME ON  MY WAY.      AT 5,500 MILES MY CAR SHUT OFF ON ME AGAIN WHILE DRIVING.  THIS WAS VERY SCARY.  IT OCCURRED WHILE MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN AT A LARGE INTERSECTION.  I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO GET HIT.  LOST ALL POWER STEERING AND CAR TOOK TIME TO RESTART.  AGAIN, THE CAR SPUTTERED AFTER THAT AND TURNED OFF A COUPLE OF MORE TIMES BEFORE I COULD GET BACK TO DEALERSHIP.    MY CAR IS NOW IN FOR AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST.  I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS ISSUE AND SEE THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHER COMPLAINTS OF THE SAME ISSUE.  A BRAND NEW CAR SHOULD NOT BE SHUTTING OFF WHILE DRIVING.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  SOME WARNING LIGHT NEEDS TO IDENTIFY THERE IS A PROBLEM.  CHECKING THE OIL EVERY 1,000 MILES IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR A NEW CAR.      THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS.  WILL IT TAKE LIVES LOST FOR ACTION TO BE TAKEN?",
