        "summary": "KEY GETS STUCK IN IGNITION WHEN TURNING OFF THE ENGINE. I PULLED INTO MY DRIVEWAY AT HOME ON LANCASTER ST IN PLATTEVILLE WISOCINSIN AND WENT TO TURN MY CAR OFF. I COULD NOT TURN THE KEY BACKWARDS TO SHUT OFF THE VEHICLE. MY CAR RAN FOR ABOUT 2 HOURS WHILE I CALLED AROUND TO MECHANICS AND DEALERSHIPS TRYING TO FIND SOMEONE WHO COULD HELP ME. THE VW DEALERSHIP IN DUBUQUE IOWA THAT I CALLED TOLD ME THAT HE HAS HEARD THIS HAS BEEN A COMMON ISSUE BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO HELP ME. HE TOLD ME I COULD TRY BREAKING  THE KEY. HOWEVER THAT MADE NO SENSE BECAUSE THE CAR WOULD STILL BE RUNNING, I WOULD STILL HAVE TO PAY TO GET THE KEY OUT, REPLACE WHATEVER IS WRONG WITH IT, AND BUY A NEW VERY EXPENSIVE KEY. MY CAR IS NOW SITTING AT A MECHANIC IN BENTON WISCONSIN WITH THE KEY STILL STUCK IN THE IGNITION.. I'M SURE HE UNHOOKED THE BATTERY SO THE ENGINE WOULD SHUT OFF. NOW I AM OUT A VEHICLE FOR 4-5 DAYS WITH THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND SO WHO KNOWS HOW SERIOUS THIS IS OR HOW SOON IT CAN BE FIXED. I WOULD APPRECIATE A RESPONSE OR SOME FEEDBACK. I AM A COLLEGE STUDENT L, I JUST BOUGHT MYSELF THIS CAR A YEAR AGO. THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING.",
