LUCKILY FOR ME THERE WAS LIGHT TRAFFIC AND NO ONE WAS STOPPED IN FRONT OF ME. WHEN THE ALARMS WENT OFF I HAD A TOTAL LOSS OF BRAKING FUNCTIONALITY INCLUDING THE EMERGENCY BRAKE UNTIL MY SPEED WAS DOWN BELOW 20MPH. THE EXTENDED WARRANTY PROVIDED BY TOYOTA TO COVER THE ISSUE SHOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT AS TOYOTAS ARE RELIABLE AND RUN FOR FAR LONGER THAN THE WARRANTY COVERED, MAKING THE VEHICLES COMPLETELY UNSAFE FOR PURCHASE AS A USED CAR. THE ALARMS ON THE VEHICLE CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES AFTER THE VEHICLE WAS TURNED OFF, THIS WAS THE 2ND TIME THE ALARMS HAD OCCURRED THE FIRST WAS IN A PARKING LOT WHERE THE VEHICLE WAS NOT MOVING SO I DIDN'T REALIZE MY BRAKES WERE AFFECTED, AT THAT TIME THE COMPUTER DID NOT EVEN REGISTER AN ALARM CODE SO TOYOTA DID NOTHING CALLING IT A GLITCH WHEN I BROUGHT IT IN, EVEN THOUGH IT'S APPARENTLY A KNOWN ISSUE.",
