VEHICLE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN TAKEN TO DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE DUE TO A SIMILAR ISSUE WHERE THE INDICATED SPEED WOULD SUDDENLY CHANGE WHILE TRAVELING AT CONSTANT SPEED AND THE TRANSMISSION WOULD DOWNSHIFT 2 OR MORE GEARS IN RESPONSE. PCM WAS REPROGRAMMED AT THAT TIME BUT THE ISSUE WOULD STILL OCCUR PERIODICALLY. DEALERSHIP IS NOW REPLACING THE TRANSMISSION MOLDED LEADFRAME AT A COST OF OVER $1000. THIS DEFECT IS IDENTICAL TO FORD SAFETY RECALL 16S19, BUT THE RECALL ONLY COVERS YEAR MODEL 2011 & 2012 VEHICLES. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE COVERED BE A RECALL.",
