I WENT OUT AND THERE WAS A SMALL FLAME UNDER THE BUMPER NEAR THE EXHAUST PIPE ALSO SOME WIRES SEEMED TO BE ON FIRE.  I WENT TO GET A HOSE, AND WHEN I RETURNED THERE WERE FLAMES ERUPTING UP NEAR THE TAIL LIGHT.  A NEIGHBOR PUT OUT THE FIRE WITH A DRY CHEMICAL EXTINGUISHER.  I CALLED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, AND THEY SAID THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT COULD'VE HAPPENED, BUT SUSPECTED AN ELECTRICAL SHORT.  I AM TAKING TO THE DEALER TO UNDERSTAND.",
