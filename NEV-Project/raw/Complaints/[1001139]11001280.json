AS I WAS READING THE MANUAL AND ENSURING ALL THE PROPER ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE FOUR OUR 6 WEEK OLD, I TUGGED ON THE SHOULDER STRAPS.  THE LEFT STRAP PULLED CLEAR THROUGH THE BACK OF THE CAR SEAT.  IT WAS NOT ATTACHED AT ALL TO THE METAL CLASP ON THE BACK OF THE CARSEAT.  THE OTHER STRAP WAS ATTACHED.  I FIND THIS EXTREMELY CONCERNING.  I'M NOT 100% SURE THAT IF I HAD PUT MY DAUGHTER IN THE SEAT AND TIGHTENED THE SLACK, THAT I WOULD HAVE NOTICED THAT ONE SIDE WAS NOT PROPERLY ATTACHED.  THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE I WOULD HAVE NOTICED THE EXTRA SLACK ON THAT SIDE, BUT IF I TESTED THE SLACK FROM THE OTHER SIDE I MIGHT NOT HAVE NOTICED.  I HAVE PICTURES I CAN SEND IN, BUT I DO NOT SEE A PLACE TO UPLOAD THEM.",
