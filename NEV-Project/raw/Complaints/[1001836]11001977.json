THIS IS VERY DISTRACTING FOR THE DRIVER AND THE PASSENGER IN THE AUTOMOBILE AND COULD LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT.  THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON VARIOUS FORUMS.  I ASKED TOYOTA FIX THIS ISSUE AND THEY OFFERED TO UPDATE THE FIRMWARE FOR $70.  THIS IS NOT A PART THAT BROKE OR DEGRADED FROM WARE, THIS RADIO DOESNT WORK AND TOYOTA IS TRYING TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF THIS.  I CONTACTED ENTUNE TO SEE IF I COULD GET THE FILE TO UPDATE THE SOFTWARE MYSELF AND WAS TOLD NO.  I WAS TOLD IF I HAD LESS THAN 36000 MILES I COULD GET THIS FIXED FOR FREE AS IT WOULD BE UNDER WARRANTY.  THIS ISNT A MAP UPDATE, THIS IS A FUNCTION THAT DOESNT WORK.  I PAID FOR THIS PREMIUM AUDIO PACKAGE THAT DOESNT WORK.  WHY WOULD MY MILEAGE  PLAY ANY PART TO MY RADIO NOT WORKING?",
