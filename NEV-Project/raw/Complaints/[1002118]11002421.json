MY CAR COPMLETLY LOST CONTROL AND I WAS LUCKY THERE WERE NO CARS BY ME OTHERWISE AN ACCIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN INEVITABLE.  WHEN I WENT TO THE DEALER THEY TOLD ME THEY HAVE NO ANSWER AND THEY SUGGESTED TO REPLACE MY IGNITION SWITCH AND CAMSHAFT SENSOR TO BEGIN WITH. NO GUARANTY THAT IT'LL FIX MY PROBLEM THEY SAID.   READING ONLINE FORUMS LOOKS LIKE I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE.  PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT OTHERWISE SOONER OR LATER LIFES WILL BE LOST.",
