ONE MONTH LATER A SIDEWALL BLOWOUT OCCURRED IN ONE OF THE NEW CONTINENTAL TIRES AFTER BEING DRIVEN LESS THAN 500 MILES. IT WAS REPLACED BY THE MANUFACTURER. THEN, AFTER DRIVING LESS THAN 7000 MILES, TWO OF FOUR TIRES WERE FOUND TO HAVE SIDE WALL BUBBLES. BECAUSE OF SAFETY CONCERN, ALL FOUR TIRES WERE REPLACED WITH ANOTHER BRAND.",
