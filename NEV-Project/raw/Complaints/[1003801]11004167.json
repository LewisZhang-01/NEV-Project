A TRAFFIC LIGHT WAS COMING UP AND WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN PLENTY OF BRAKING ROOM WAS NOT.  WHEN I APPLIED MY BRAKES THEY FELT SOFT WHEN I KNEW I WASN'T STOPPING I YANKED INTO THE OTHER LANE CUTTING OFF ANOTHER CAR GOING THE SAME DIRECTION. MY BRAKES FINALLY STOPPED MY CAR  JUST SHORT OF GOING INTO  THE INTERSECTION INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC. I AVOIDED NOT HITTING THE SUV BECAUSE OF MY QUICK THINKING AND REFLEXES; HOWEVER, I WAS FEET FROM A POSSIBLE LIFE THREATENING ACCIDENT.",
