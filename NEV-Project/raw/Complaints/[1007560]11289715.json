WHEN I TURNED THE STEERING WHEEL TO THE LEFT ALL THE WAY, BOTH AIRBAGS DEPLOYED. I WAS BURNED BY THE CHEMICALS OVER THE LEFT SIDE OF MY NECK AND CHEST, LEFT EAR AND INSIDE LEFT WRIST. I WAS TRAVELING LESS THAN 5 MPH WHILE MAKING THIS TURN. THE PASSENGER AIRBAG KNOCKED MY WINDOW CAMERA OFF AND BROKE IT AND SENT PART OF A HANDHELD FAN CLIPPED TO THE PASSENGERS VISOR, INTO MY HEAD AND ENDED UP IN THE BACKSEAT. I DID NOT HIT ANYTHING AS IT WAS JUST DIRT.",
