THE PEDAL WILL HAVE TO BE PUSHED TO THE FLOOR AND THE CAR WILL ONLY SLIGHTLY SLOW. THIS HAS HAPPENED INTERMITTENTLY 2 OR 3 TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR. THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO CORRECT ITSELF AFTER 5 TO 10 MINUTES OF DRIVING AND \"PUMPING\" THE BRAKES. THE LOCAL FORD DEALER CLAIMS IT IS A FAULTY HYDRAULIC CONTROL UNIT. A PRIOR EVENT HAPPENED WITH THE SAME RESULT WHEN JUST BEGINNING TO DRIVE ON A FLAT, SMOOTH SURFACE.",
