The battery was just a few months outside of it's warranty, with it needing to be jump started frequently. It was tested at an Autozone then at the Subaru dealership confirming the bad battery. Subaru dealership confirmed the software malfunction that caused the problem. However, the software update needed was never done and was never communicated as a need. I have always taken the car in for all maintenance and this software update should have been done by Subaru. There was no warning signal/message other than the battery dying multiple times.",
