JUST GOOGLE, \"CHECK VSC SYSTEM TOYOTA CAMRY HYBRID\" AND YOU WILL SEE THAT 100S OF RESULTS SHOW UP INVOLVING THREADS THAT ARE AT TIMES 100 POSTS LONG AND MENTIONING SPECIFICS LIKE \"INTERMITTENT LOSS OF ASSISTED BRAKING\" AND \"NHTSA INVESTIGATING 30,000 TOYOTA CAMRY HYBRIDS FOR BRAKE ASSIST PROBLEMS\" - BRAKE ASSIST PROBLEMS ARE NOT TO BE IGNORED. TOYOTA IS ACTING SOCIALLY IRRESPONSIBLY, WITHOUT QUESTION, TO NOT HAVE ISSUED A RECALL ON THIS PART. SINCE I PICKED UP THE VEHICLE 5 YEARS AGO (USED WITH 45K ON IT) THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A STRANGE SOUND WHEN APPLYING THE BRAKES, ESPECIALLY WHEN AGGRESSIVELY - IF NEEDED. I HAVE A NEWBORN ON THE WAY AND WILL NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING IN MY 2007 TOYOTA CAMRY HYBRID UNTIL I CAN AFFORD THIS COSTLY REPAIR (AT AVERAGE OF $2500-$3000 TO HAVE DEALER INSTALL, FROM WHAT OTHERS SAY). PLEASE HELP. WE ALSO OWN A 2017 TOYOTA RAV4 HYBRID AND HAVE SO FAR HAD NO ISSUES WITH THAT.",
