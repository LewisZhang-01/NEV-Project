IN THIS POSITION, THE TRANSMISSION GEARS CAN BE CHANGED WITHOUT TOUCHING THE BUTTON IS SUCH A FASHION AS TO MOVE THE TRANSMISSION FROM PARK TO REVERSE, NEUTRAL, DRIVE AND IN THIS MODULE IT HAS A SO CALLED MANUAL MODE. SO ONE COULD BUMP THE GEAR FROM REVERSE TO DRIVE OR FROM DRIVE TO REVERSE JUST BY TOUCHING THE GEAR SHIFTER. OF COURSE, WITH THIS BUTTON IN THE IN POSITION YOU CANNOT REMOVE THE KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION. I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND THUS REPORTING IT AS SUCH. THIS ISSUE CAN HAPPEN BOTH DRIVING AND BEFORE DRIVING. AS IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE THE CAR THIS WAY I WILL BE TAKING THIS IN TO A CHEVROLET DEALER TO BE FIXED.",
