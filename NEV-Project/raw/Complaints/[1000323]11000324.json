        "summary": "HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHY THE NHTSA HAS NOT FORCED A RECALL CONCERNING THE MAJOR ISSUES FOUND WITH THESE TRANSMISSIONS? HAS FORD PULLED THE WOOL OVER THE EYES OF NHTSA JUST AS THEY HAVE WITH THEIR VERY OWN CUSTOMERS? MY CAR SITS AT THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE IM NOT CONVINCED THE MECHANIC HAS DETERMINED THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE TRANS TO CAUSE A LOSS OF POWER WHILE I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 20-25MPH THE TRANS SEEMED TO SLIP INTO NEUTRAL BUT WHEN PRESSING THE GAS PED THE ENGINE WOULDNT REV NOR WOULD THE CAR GO ANY FASTER. I WAS 1/4 MILE FROM MY HOUSE & TURNED AROUND TO GO BACK, I SHUT THE CAR OFF & BACK ON, THE ENGINE REVVED & BACK TO IDLE, I PUT IN REVERSE & IT HESITATED TO MOVE BUT DID, I PUT IN FORWARD & IT REVVED UP 2X AGAIN WHILE I TO COAST TO MY DRIVEWAY. MY CAR HAS SHUDDERED AT TIMES & SEEMED TO HESITATE TO KNOW WHAT GEAR TO GO INTO ALTHOUGH I FIGURED IT TO BE NORMAL SINCE I OWNED THE CAR SINCE 9/2016 & THE MORE I DROVE THE MORE I ASSUMED IT WAS A TYPE OF TRANS THAT ACTED LIKE A MANUAL WHEN IT CHANGED GEARS, I HAVE ONLY RECENTLY LEARNED OF ALL THE MAJOR PROBLEMS WHILE DOING RESEARCH. I AM CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY AFTER READING JUST A SMALL AMOUNT OF CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS. THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON WHEN I EXPERIENCED THE LOSS OF POWER AND CODES P2831 P2832 & P287B WERE PRESENT. THE MECHANIC SAID THE \"MECHANICAL MECHANISM\" IS \"STUCK\" KEEPING THE CLUTCH APPLIED. HE MADE THIS ASSUMPTION WITH THE TRANSMISSION STILL INSTALLED & NOT CHECKING THE INTERNAL COMPONENTS; HE MUST BE PRETTY DARN GOOD TO DO ALL THAT! HE CHECKED THE TCM PER NOTIFICATION 14M02 WHICH SURPRISING PASSED. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE NOTIFICATION 14M01 WAS NOT CHECKED WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE TRANS BE REMOVED FROM WHAT I READ. TSB 15-0121 ALSO CALLS OUT A POTENTIAL CAUSE. THEY WANT ME TO PAY $2500 TO REPLACE THE CLUTCH JUST TO BE ABLE TO FURTHER DIAGNOSE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITHOUT FULLY DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM. 78000MI",
