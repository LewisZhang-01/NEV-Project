        "summary": "I  HAVE A 2013 NISSAN ROGUE THAT THE TRANSMISSION JUST DIED ON ME. THE CAR HAS 103 K MILES AND DIED ON ME IN THE MIDDLE LANE OF A 3 LANE HIGHWAY. I WAS DOING 70 MPH AND THE CAR SPEED DROPPED TO LESS THAN 5 MPH. I HAD MY FOOT ON THE PEDAL FOR A GOOD MINUTE BUT THE CAR WON'T GO OVER 5 MPH. I FINALLY MANAGED TO SAFELY GET OUT OF THE HIGHWAY AND THE CAR JUST DIED ON THE SIDE OF ROAD. TOWED THE CAR TO THE NISSAN DEALER AND WAS TOLD THE CVT TRANSMISSION NEEDS REPAIRED. THEY KNOW THAT  OLDER MODELS WERE COVERED UNDER A NISSAN EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THE CVT TRANSMISSION,BUT MY 2013 ROGUE WAS NOT COVERED AND THERE WAS NOTHING THEY CAN DO. THIS CAR IS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE. THE SPEED ON THIS CAR SHOULD NOT JUST DROP FROM 70 MPH TO 5 MPH IN A MATTER OF SECONDS, IT IS DANGEROUS. NISSAN IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM BUT WON'T ADMIT IT. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE DRIVING THIS CARS AND NOT KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THEY ARE. NISSAN NEEDS TO FIX THIS ISSUE BEFORE SOMEONE LOSES THEIR LIFE OVER THIS.",
