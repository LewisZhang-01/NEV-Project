AS DOES MY MOTHER IN LAW'S 2010 TIGUAN.  PLEASE LOOK INTO EXTENDING THE RECALL TO THESE MODEST.  ATTACHED IS THE $2,839 ESTIMATE FROM A VW DEALER TO REPLACE THE ABS MODULE.   THAT IS AN ABSURD AMOUNT OF MONEY TO PAY FOR A GENTLY USED CAR WITH LOW MILEAGE WHICH HAS BEEN REGULARLY MAINTAINED.  THANK YOU.
