        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING APPROX. 30 MPH (MOVING STRAIGHT; NOT TURNING) A NOISE WAS HEARD, THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE SEEMED TO DROP, AND BOTH STEERING AND BRAKES BECAME ERRATIC.  THE VAN, STILL ACTING UP, MADE IT TO A PARKING LOT, WHERE A VISUAL INSPECTION OF THE FRONT DRIVER'S SIDE WHEEL WELL INDICATED WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE A BROKEN CONTROL ARM (SEE PHOTO).  THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THIS VEHICLE, AND LATE IN 2013 THERE WAS A RECALL (# 13V556000).  VEHICLE OWNERS WERE ADVISED TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER FOR AND INSPECTION AND EITHER RUSTPROOFING OR REPLACEMENT OF THE CONTROL ARMS.  ON 1/20/14, THE VEHICLE UNDERWENT THIS PROCESS AND REPORTED \"INSPECTED, WAXED, AND UNDERCOATED AS PER CAMPAIGN\" (SEE EXCERPT FROM INVOICE).    NO DAMAGE TO THE CONTROL ARMS WAS REPORTED BY THE DEALER'S SERVICE SHOP.      HAD I BEEN INFORMED OF A DAMAGED PART DURING THE \"INSPECTION\", I WOULD HAVE CHOSEN TO REPLACE IT, AS THIS IS APPARENTLY VITAL TO KEEPING CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE.  OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS, I HAVE DONE A LOT OF HIGHWAY DRIVING.  HAD THIS HAPPENED AT 65 OR 70 MPH, RATHER THAN AT THE 30 MPH IN THE CITY, THE OUTCOME COULD HAVE BEEN DISASTROUS.  A POLICE OFFICER SHOWED UP TO HELP AND TOOK DOWN MY NAME - I DO NOT KNOW IF A FORMAL REPORT WILL BE FILED..",
