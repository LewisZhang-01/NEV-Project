        "summary": "I NOTICED A SLIGHT TICKING SOUND AT AROUND 63,000 MILES IN MY 2015 HYUNDAI ELANTRA WHILE MY CAR WAS IDLING. I HAD THE VEHICLE DIAGNOSED BY AN ASE CERTIFIED MECHANIC. THEY DETERMINED A KNOCKING/PINGING IN THE AREA OF CYLINDER NUMBER ONE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE. OIL HAS ALWAYS BEEN CHANGED AROUND 3,000 MILES. THE SOUNDS HAS PROGRESSIVELY GOTTEN WORSE AND HAS BECOME A LOUD KNOCKING SOUND WITH LOSS OF POWER. THE VEHICLE HAS ABOUT 70,000 MILES ON IT NOW AND THE ENGINE IS STARTING TO FAIL MORE. THE LOUD KNOCKING SOUND IS CONSTANT FROM IDLE THROUGH ACCELERATION. I WAS CURIOUS IF OTHER PEOPLE HAD THIS SAME ISSUE SO I DID SOME RESEARCH. MANY CARS WITH THE SAME MAKE AND MODEL WERE RECALLED FOR THE SAME ISSUE I'M HAVING. IM AFRAID THE ENGINE IS GOING TO SEIZE SOON WHILE DRIVING AND I'M CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THIS PROBLEM NOW. I DON'T THINK A CAR SHOULD BE DOING THIS AT 70,000 MILES",
