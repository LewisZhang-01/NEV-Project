OUR SHOP PULLED THE COVER OFF TO INSPECT THE DAMAGE TO DETERMINE THE REPAIRS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED. AT THAT TIME WE DISCOVERED THAT THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN UNDER A RECALL OR BUYBACK SINCE 2/2013. WE WERE NEVER NOTIFIED OF THE RECALL AND NEITHER WAS THE PRIOR OWNER. THE VEHICLE HAD BEEN TO A DODGE DEALER FOR SERVICE IN 9/2013 AND WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF A RECALL. IT WAS ALSO TRANSFERRED AT CA DMV OVER 1 YEAR AFTER THE RECALL WITHOUT ANY RECALL NOTIFICATION COMING UP. I HAVE TAKEN TO DODGE DEALERSHIP WHO IS REFUSING TO FIX THE VEHICLE WITHOUT CHARGING ME FOR THE WORK. THEY STATE THAT THEY DONT KNOW IF THE RECALLED ITEM CAUSED THE PROBLEM. ITS VERY OBVIOUS TO ANYONE THAT THE PROBLEM OF THE PINION NUT BACKING OFF CAUSED THIS PROBLEM",
