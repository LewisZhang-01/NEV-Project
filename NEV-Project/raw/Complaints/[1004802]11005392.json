I HAVE QUERIED OUR LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP (AS WELL AS OTHER DEALERSHIPS IN THE DALLAS AREA) AND HAVE BEEN GIVEN NO INFORMATION AS TO WHEN THIS SAFETY ITEM WILL BE RESOLVED.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE LOCAL FORD SERVICE MANAGER THAT THERE APPEARS TO BE NO REAL URGENCY TO REPLACE THIS AIRBAG DUE TO COST (IT IS LESS COSTLY TO DEAL WITH LAWSUITS THAN WITH REPLACEMENT).  I WAS TOLD BY THE SALES DIRECTOR AT THE SAME DEALERSHIP THAT THEY WOULD BUY MY CAR AT BLACK BOOK VALUE AS TRADE-IN ON ANOTHER VEHICLE.  WHEN I ASKED WHAT WOULD BE DONE WITH MY FUSION I WAS ADVISED THAT IT WOULD BE SOLD SOMEWHERE OUT OF THE US WHERE THERE ARE NO RECALL CONCERNS.",
