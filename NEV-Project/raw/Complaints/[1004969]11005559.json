        "summary": "NO OR MINIMAL FORWARD MOVEMENT WHEN PRESSING THE ACCELERATOR FROM A STOPPED POSITION (IN AUTOMATIC).  THE OPERATOR MUST DEPRESS THE ACCELERATOR ALMOST TO THE FLOOR BEFORE THERE'S ANY ACCELERATION (AND GETTING HIGH RPMS). IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE THE VEHICLE IS ATTEMPTING TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE WRONG GEAR - THERE'S NO POWER/TORQUE. THIS SITUATION OCCURS FREQUENTLY AND IS MOST DANGEROUS WHEN DRIVING THROUGH AN INTERSECTION FROM A FULL STOP - ESPECIALLY WHEN ATTEMPTING A LEFT-HAND TURN WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC (BUT NOT LIMITED TO TURNS). THE VEHICLE SLOWS ALMOST TO A STALL.  THESE SYMPTOMS OCCUR IN ALL 3 DRIVE MODES: ECO, STANDARD, AND SPORT.  HOWEVER, I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THESE SYMPTOMS AT NIGHT OR LEAVING A GARAGE IN THE MORNING.  IT APPEARS TO OCCUR AFTER THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN SITTING IN THE SUN FOR A LONG PERIOD, I.E, WHEN THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE OF THE VEHICLE IS HOT. I LIVE IN ARIZONA.  AS ADDED CONTEXT, IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS IS MY 3RD HYUNDAI TUCSON SE. THE PREVIOUS MODELS WERE 2010 AND 2013. I NEVER EXPERIENCED THESE SYMPTOMS WITH THOSE EARLIER MODELS.  I HAVE 3000+ MILES ON THE VEHICLE AND HAVE MORE OR LESS EXPERIENCED THE SAME SYMPTOMS SINCE THE VEHICLE WAS NEW.",
