THEY HAVE NOT RECALLED THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG ON MY VEHICLE.    WHY HASN'T HONDA RECALLED THE PASSENGER SIDE OF MY CAR. THIS NEEDS TO BE INSPECTED TO TO CONFIRM WHICH PARTS ARE USED , AND HONDA DOES NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT INFLATOR OR PROPELLANT WAS USED ON MY CAR. THE LEAST THEY CAN DO IS INSPECT THE VEHICLE TO SEE IF TAKATA PARTS WERE USED AND IF SO RECALL THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG.",
