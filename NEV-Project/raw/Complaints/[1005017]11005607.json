I WAS DRIVING, THEN A NOTICED POPPED ON MY DASHBOARD STATING TO STOP SAFELY NOW. I PRESSED THE GAS PETTLE AND THE EV MODE KICKED ON, PROPELLING MY VEHICLE SPEED TO OVER 85 MILES PER HOUR. I WAS EXTREMELY NERVOUS BECAUSE THE FORDS ELECTRIC VEHICLE ENGINES ARE LIMITED TO 85 MPH IN PURE EV MODE. I WAS ABLE TO COME TO THE SHOULDER OF THE INTERSTATE. I TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF, WAITED A FEW SECONDS AND RESTARTED THE VEHICLE. ALL SEEMED TO BE OK, AS SOON AS I PUSHED THE GAS PETTLE TO GET BACK ON THE HIGHWAY THE INFORMATION DASHBOARD WAS ALARMING ME TO STOP SAFELY NOW. I DID NOT HAVE ANY CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS COME ON. I THEN REVVED THE ENGINE TO SEE IF I WOULD EXPERIENCE ANYTHING, THE ENGINE FINALLY CAME ON, THEN REVVED AND I FELT THAT EVEN THOUGH I WAS IN PARK IF MY FOOT WOULD HAVE BEEN OFF OF THE BREAK PETTLE MY VEHICLE WOULD HAVE MOVED FORWARD. I TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF AS SOON AS I FELT THIS THE ENGINE WAS CONSTANTLY REVVING UNTIL I TURNED THE KEY TO THE OFF SWITCH. I THEN HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP. I WAS DRIVING AT 76 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY AND COMPLETE FAILURE OCCURRED.",
