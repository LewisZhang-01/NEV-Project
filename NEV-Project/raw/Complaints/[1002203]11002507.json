ON SUNDAY, IT WAS LOSING POWER GOING UP HILLS.  HAD TO TAKE FOOT OFF EXCELLOATOR AND PAT IT AND THEN HOLD IT DOWN TO GET UP TO 70MPH.  USING A LOT OF GAS FROM 25 MILES PER GALLON TO 14 MPG.  COULDN'T DRIVE OVER 65 ON THE WAY HOME.  TOOK IT TO DEALER.  HE SAID OIL WAS 2.5 QRTS LOW EVEN THOUGH I JUST HAD IT CHANGED.  THEY CHECKED THE RECALL AND OIL AND GAS FILTERS BUT CANNOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT.  NOW IT WILL ONLY GO 40 MPH.  THEY ARE CONFUSED AND CALLING KIA MASTER MECHANIC.  THE RECALL STATES THIS EXACT THING HAPPENING BUT THEY SAY IT IS NOT THE RECALL.",
