VERY DANGEROUS AND SCARY TO DRIVE CAR. TOOK THE CAR TO BMW SERVICE, THEY COULDNT FIND ANYTHING WRONG, DID SOFTWARE UPDATE WHICH MADE ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE. ACCORDING TO BMW BLOG, MANY MANY COMPLIANT ABOUT THIS ISSUE FOR PEOPLE LIVING IN COLD CLIMATES IN WINTER. APPEARS BMW IS AWARE OF THE ISSUE BUT SO FAR HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING TO CORRECT THE ISSUE, AGAIN, THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND NEEDS TO BE CORRECTED ASAP. THIS HAPPENS AT ALL SPEEDS. ONCE THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURES ARE ABOVE 15 DEGREES, PROBLEM GOES AWAY.",
