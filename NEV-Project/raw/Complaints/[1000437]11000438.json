BUT I HAVE NOT HEARD AS TO WHEN THIS SAFETY ISSUE WILL BE RESOLVED.EVERY TIME I DRIVE THE CAR I FEEL I AM RISKING MY LIFE OR CHANCE FOR SERIOUS INJURY. BMW HAS BEEN COMPLETELY NEGLIGENT WITH REGARDS TO RESOLVING THIS ISSUE. BMW SHOULD TEMPORARILY REMEDY THE SITUATION BY REPLACING THE CAR WITH A SIMILAR VEHICLE. I NEED THIS TO BE RESOLVED NOW!!!.  ALSO THE DRIVE TRAIN HAS A CLUNKING NOISE OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING SINCE NEW. THEY HAVE MADE TEMPORARY ADJUSTMENT BUT THE PROBLEM STILL SURFACES. THIS HAPPENS WHEN I SHIFT GEARS EVEN AT SLOW SPEEDS (6 SPD MANUAL TRANSMISSION).",
