        "summary": "ON SUNDAY MARCH 29,2020, THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION ON A CITY STREET, MY WIFE WAS DRIVING THE VEHICLE TO HER DAUGHTER'S HOUSE.  A KNOCKING NOISE FROM THE ENGINE AND ILLUMINATION OF THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT HAPPENED. THE VEHICLE THEN STALLED AND THE ENGINE WENT DEAD. IT DID NOT RESPOND AT ALL TO START IT. IT WAS TOWED TO MY WIFE'S DAUGHTER'S HOUSE BY A FRIEND OF MINE WITH A STRAP TO PULL A VEHICLE. THE DISTANCE TO HER HOUSE WAS ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE. THE NEXT DAY ON 03/30/2020 I WENT TO GO CHECK ON IT TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. THERE WAS NO RESPONSE ON THE ENGINE. ON 03/31/2020 I CONTACTED ALLSTATE, MY INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED BY A WRECKER TO AN AUTO ELECTRIC BUSINESS. ON 04/02/2020 THE MECHANIC SAID I NEEDED A NEW MOTOR, THE ENGINE WAS LOCKED. THAT SAME DAY ALLSTATE TOWED IT TO A MECHANIC. ON 04/03/2020 THE MECHANIC CALLED ME AND SAID THE ENGINE WAS LOCKED AND NOT RESPONDING. HE SAID I NEEDED A NEW MOTOR OR A USED ONE. I THEN LEFT IT THERE UNTIL I RESEARCHED ANY RECALLS ON THIS MAKE AND MODEL. ON 04/08/2020 I FOUND A WEBSITE THAT IS AUTOSERVICE. HYUNDAIUSA.COM AND IT DID SAY MY WIFE'S VEHICLE WAS AFFECTED. I REQUEST A RECALL ON THIS MAKE AND MODEL ON THE ENGINE TO BE INSPECTED BY A HYUNDAI DEALER. MY COMPLAINT AS A BUYER ON THIS VEHICLE IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF THIS PROBLEM OF METAL DEBRIS GENERATED ON THE MANUFACTURING OF THE ENGINE. THESE ENGINES WERE MANUFACTURED AT HYUNDAI MOTOR MANUFACTURING ALABAMA.",
