AFTER SOME RESEARCH I LEARNED THAT THERE WAS A LIMITED SERVICE CAMPAIGN FOR CERTAIN VINS OF THIS CAR FROM THE YEARS 2001--2004 (SEE HTTPS://WWW.TOYOHEADQUARTERS.COM/THREADS/2001-2004-TOYOTA-SEQUOIA-RUST-CORROSION-ON-FRAME-CONDITION-LSC-CSD.200/). I CHECKED WITH TOYOTA AND THE VIN ON MY CAR WAS NOT PART OF THE LIMITED SERVICE CAMPAIGN FOR FRAME REPLACEMENT, BUT MY CAR DID GET A CORROSION RESISTANT TREATMENT FROM TOYOTA IN 2012. IT IS VERY CLEAR FROM THE PICTURES OF MY FRAME AND THE INSPECTION REPORT FROM THE TOYOTA SERVICE CENTER THAT THE CONDITION OF THE FRAME MAKES THE CAR UNSAFE (IT WON'T PASS INSPECTION). THEREFORE, THE CORROSION RESISTANCE TREATMENT DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I CONTACTED TOYOTA AND ASKED THEM TO RECONSIDER MY CAR FOR THE FRAME REPLACEMENT. THEY TOLD ME THAT THE LIMITED SERVICE CAMPAIGN EXPIRED IN 2015. THE FRAME ON THIS CAR NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. TOYOTA WOULDN'T TELL ME WHY SOME OF THE TOYOTA SEQUOIAS RECEIVED THE FRAME REPLACEMENT AND WHY OTHERS DIDN'T, BUT MY CAR (AND PROBABLY MANY OTHERS) AREN'T DRIVABLE AND AREN'T SAFE WITH THE CURRENT FRAMES. TOYOTA NEEDS TO BE THOROUGH AND SAFE AND RECALL THE REST OF THESE CARS WITH DEFECTIVE FRAMES.",
