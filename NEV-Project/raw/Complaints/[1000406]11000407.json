BOTH OF US THOUGHT MAYBE A BIRD HIT US OR SOMETHING BECAUSE THERE HADN'T BEEN ANYTHING IN THE ROAD.  SO WE PULL OF THE HIGHWAY AT THE NEXT EXIT, GET OUT TO EXPECT FEATHERS, BUT INSTEAD FIND THAT THE DRIVERS SIDE WINDSHIELD PILLAR TRIM MOLDING WAS COMPLETELY GONE.  HAD BEEN RIPPED OFF BY THE WIND - WHICH IT WASN'T EVEN WINDY THAT DAY, JUST THE WIND OF GOING DOWN THE HIGHWAY.  DROPPED IT OFF TO THE DEALERSHIP LAST NIGHT TO BE FIXED AND THEY TOLD US THIS IS A \"COMMON ISSUE\" WITH THE EXPLORERS!  HOW CAN THIS BE A COMMON ISSUE AND NO FIX IN PLACE???  IT IS IN FOR SERVICE NOW AT THE DEALERSHIP AND I'M STILL WAITING TO HEAR IF THIS IS COVERED UNDER WARRANTY OR NOT.",
