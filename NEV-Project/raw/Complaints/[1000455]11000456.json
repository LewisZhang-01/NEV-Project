GOT TOWED TO FORD, ONLY HAD VEHICLE SINCE FEB. 2017, SAUDERED AND RECONNECTED SOME WIRING THAT THEY SAID WAS CHEWED BY SOME CRITTER, I.E. MOUSE.  $360. LATER.  AFTER DOING MY OWN RESEARCH I SEE WIRING IS BEING BEING COVERED IN SOME SOY COATING AND SEATS ARE MADE WITH OTHER PRODUCTS THAT CAN LURE CRITTERS.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND FEEL WHY SHOULD I PAY THAT OUT OF POCKET.",
