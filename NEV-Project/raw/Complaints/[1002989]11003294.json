        "summary": "I PURCHASED A USED 2015 FORD ESCAPE ON MAY 10, 2017. I DROVE IT TO YELLOWSTONE OVER MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND TO TEST THE VEHICLE OUT. THE TRANSMISSION WOULD SHIFT REALLY HARD AND AT 40 MPH IT SEEMED TO HESITATE WHAT GEAR TO SHIFT TO. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP, WHO SENT IT TO A FORD DEALERSHIP AND THEY RESET THE TRANSMISSION. THEY SAID THE CAR LEARNS A DRIVER'S DRIVING HABITS AND SINCE SOMEONE ELSE OWNED THE CAR IT WASN'T USED TO MY DRIVING HABITS. THE RESET ON THE TRANSMISSION HAS HELP A LITTLE, I STILL DO NOT LIKE THE WAY IT SHIFTS AT 40 MPH AND IT ALSO HESITATES TO GO AND THEN WHEN IT KICKS IN IT IS HARD TO SLOW DOWN.     YESTERDAY JULY 5, 2017 I WAS DRIVING BACK TO WORK FROM LUNCH AND MY POWER STEERING FAILED. I HAD A WARNING COME ON AT THE SAME TIME I NOTICED THE POWER STEERING WAS GONE. I WAS GLAD I WAS ON A BACK ROAD OR IT COULD HAVE CAUSED AND ACCIDENT. I COULDN'T MOVE THE STEERING WHEEL. I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A FORD DEALERSHIP. I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING REGARDING THE ISSUE YET.  I HAVE ONLY HAD THE CAR FOR ALMOST 60 DAYS AND I HAVE HAD IT SERVICED TWICE. I DON'T FEEL I CAN TRUST THIS CAR. MY 10 YEAR OLD VAN WITH 170,000 MILES IS MORE RELIABLE.",
