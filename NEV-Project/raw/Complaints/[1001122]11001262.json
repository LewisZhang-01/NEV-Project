THE TOP BALL JOINT HAS POPPED APART.  EVEN IF  THE SUSPENSION WAS HIT IN THE CRASH THE BALL JOINT SHOULD NOT HAVE POPPED.  YOU HAVE SEVERAL OTHER COMPLAINTS ON RECORD OF TESLA BALL JOINTS COMING APART.  IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT THE BALL-JOINT FAILURE CAUSED THE CRASH.  ALSO THE TESLA HAS ONCE AGAIN SELF-IGNITED.  CRASH TESTS NEED TO BE DONE WITH A BATTERY THAT IS HOT FROM RECENT CHARGING OR FROM FAST DRIVING TO FIND OUT WHY TESLAS BURST INTO FLAMES SO OFTEN.      PLEASE INVESTIGATE",
