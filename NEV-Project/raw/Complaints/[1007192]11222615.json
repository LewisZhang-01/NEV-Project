WAS TOLD NO CODES WERE FOUND WRONG AND THEY COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE ISSUE. APRIL 30, 2019 HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED BACK IN. WAS INFORMED OF A RECALL ON LEAD MANE FRAME FOR FIRST TIME. AFTER REPLACING LEAD FRAME VEHICLE STILL WILL NOT PREFORM PROPERLY AND I HAVE NOW BEEN TOLD ENTIRE TRANSMISSION NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. I HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY LETTER NOR MADE AWARE AT TIME OF PURCHASE OF ANY RECALL. FORD CONTINUES TO REFUSE ANY REMEDIES TO JUSTIFY THIS PROBLEM. I'M A SINGLE MOTHER OF  3 AND AM OUTRAGED BY THE COMPANIES FAILURE TO NOTIFY ME OF THIS SAFETY RECALL. THE COMPANY REFUSES TO HELP BECAUSE MY MILEAGE IS 152,000 MILES. 2,000 OVER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR RECALL. IF I WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED IN A TIMELY MANNER OF THIS FAULTY TRANSMISSION AND POSSIBLY DEADLY RECALL I WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATELY TENDED TO IT. MY CHILDREN ARE MY WORLD AND FORD CARES LESS ABOUT THEIR SAFETY AND MINE AND IT IS WRONG. PLEASE HELP ME AND MY BABIES.",
