        "summary": "WHILE ON A ROAD TRIP FROM THE SF BAY AREA TO LAS VEGAS AND HAVING BEEN THERE JUST ONE DAY, THE VALET AT CEASAR'S PALACE DROVE MY TRUCK TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE OF THE HOTEL/CASINO WHERE MANY PEOPLE AND VEHICLES WERE COMING AND GOING. WHEN I GOT IN MY TRUCK, THE BRAKE WARNING/FAILURE LIGHTS WERE BRIGHTLY LIT AND THE BRAKE PEDAL WENT MUSHY RIGHT TO THE FLOOR. WHEN I INSPECTED THE BRAKE FLUID RESERVOIR, IT WAS NEAR EMPTY (SEE ATTACHED PHOTO). WHEN I LOOKED BENEATH THE VEHICLE, THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A LEAK AND NO INDICATION OF A LEAK IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. THE TRUCK MILEAGE WAS AROUND 62K AND HAD THE 60K SERVICE RECENTLY WHICH INCLUDED NEW FRONT ROTORS AND PADS INSTALLED BY A FORD DEALER IN THE SF BAY AREA.      FOR THE BRAKE FAILURE, I HAD THE TRUCK REPAIRED AT THE FORD DEALER IN LAS VEGAS. THEY REPORTED THAT BRAKE FLUID LEAKED FROM THE HYDRAULIC CYLINDER SECONDARY SEAL INTO THE BRAKE BOOSTER. BOTH THE HYDRAULIC CYLINDER AND BRAKE BOOSTER REQUIRED REPLACEMENT AT A COST OF NEARLY $1400.00!     FORTUNATELY, I WASN'T DRIVING WHEN THE BRAKE FAILURE OCCURRED. THERE WERE NO ACCIDENTS OR INJURIES. THANK GOD.",
