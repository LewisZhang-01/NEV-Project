THIS HAPPENED WHILE DRIVING 70 MPH DOWN THE INTERSTATE. I NOTICED ALL MY DASH LIGHT CAME ON AND MY VEHICLE HAD COMPLETELY POWERED OFF LEAVING ME WITH NO POWER STEERING AND NO ANTI LOCK BRAKES. LUCKILY I WAS ON STRAIGHT ENOUGH ROAD TO ONLY RUN OFF THE ROAD ONCE I SLOWED DOWN. IAFTER HITTING A DITCH I NOTICED MY SEATBELT DID NOT LOCK CAUSING ME TO SLIGHTLY BUMP MY HEAD. I WASN'T HURT BUT THIS HAS TO BE A ISSUE. IT HAS WORKED PROPERLY SINCE THEN BUT DID THE SAME THING ON A LATER DATE WHILE DRIVING IN TOWN.",
