        "summary": "THE HONDA AT WITH DCT TRANSMISSION:  WHEN HITTING THE FRONT BRAKE (RIGHT GRIP) THE RIGHT HAND IS STILL ON THE THROTTLE.  A SLIGHT HAND SHIFT WHEN GRABBING THE BRAKE (ESPECIALLY UNDER EMERGENCY BRAKING) WILL CAUSE THE THROTTLE TO ENGAGE FORCING THE BIKE TO LOOSE CONTROL.  THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW.  THE THROTTLE SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY DISENGAGE WHEN THE THE FRONT LEVER/BRAKE IS A APPLIED.  WITH A CLUTCH OPERATION THIS CAN BE CONTROLLED VIA THE LEFT HAND, BUT WITH THE DCT (AUTOMATIC) THE CLUTCH DOES NOT DISENGAGE.  THE REAR BRAKE (RIGHT FOOT) SHOULD BE SETUP NORMALLY, AS IT IS ROUTINELY USED TO MANAGE THE BIKE UNDER SLOW CONDITIONS WITH THROTTLE APPLICATION.     THIS DANGEROUS SITUATION HAS HAPPENED TO ME.  APPLIED BOTH BRAKES WHICH IS VERY INTUITIVE UNDER DURESS.  AS RIGHT HAND WAS GRABBING BRAKE, THE SHIFTING OF THE RIGHT HAND ALSO ENGAGED THE THROTTLE, CAUSING THE BIKE TO LURCH FORWARD IN AN UNANTICIPATED AND UNNATURAL REACTION.",
