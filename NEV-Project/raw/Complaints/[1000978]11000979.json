IS THIS A PROBLEM INVOLVING THE TAKATA RECALL?   I NEED TO HAVE IT FIXED.  THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING FROM TIME TO TIME FOR OVER A YEAR OR MORE, BUT WHEN IT DIDN'T STAY ON, I JUST DIDN'T REMEMBER TO DEAL WITH IT.....IT IS NOW ON MOST OF THE TIME.   THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE CAR IS STARTED AND REMAINS ON UNTIL TURNED OFF.",
