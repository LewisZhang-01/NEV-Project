        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING ON RESIDENTIAL STREET AT 30 MPH, VSC, ABS AND TRAC DASH LIGHTS CAME ON AND CABIN ALARM SOUNDED.  THE BRAKES WERE NOT FUNCTIONING.  I HAD TO USE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE AND EVASIVE DRIVING TO AVOID REAR ENDING A SCHOOL BUS.  AFTER BRINGING TO MY MECHANIC I LEARNED THAT THE MASTER BRAKE CYLINDER HAD FAILED.  THE PART IS $3,100 FROM TOYOTA.  SPENDING MONEY ON CAR PARTS AND REPAIR IS ALL A PART OF OWNING A VEHICLE, BUT NO CAR SHOULD BE DESIGNED WHERE THE BRAKES COMPLETELY STOP OPERATING BECAUSE OF AN ELECTRICAL SHORT.  IT IS INSANELY DANGEROUS AND THIS WILL CAUSE DEATHS FOR SURE, HOW CAN IT NOT?  I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS AND IT IS A VERY COMMON AND WELL KNOWN ISSUE.  A LOT OF DRIVERS HAVE BEEN VERY FRIGHTENED BY THIS ISSUE, INCLUDING MYSELF.",
