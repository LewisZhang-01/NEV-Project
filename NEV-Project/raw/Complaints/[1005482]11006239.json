        "summary": "DRIVER & PASSENGER SUN VISORS HAVE EITHER FALLEN OFF COMPLETELY AND/OR NO LONGER ABLE TO STAY UP AND OUT OF WAY. THIS HAS OCCURRED SEVERAL TIMES THROUGHOUT THE YEARS. WE'VE REPLACED THESE VISORS 2 TO 3 TIMES, AT LEAST ONCE WITH DEALER. NEVER NOTIFIED OF ANY RECALL THROUGHOUT THE YEARS.    MOST RECENT INCIDENT OCCURRED THE MORNING OF 7/18/17, WHEN DRIVER SIDE VISOR SUDDENLY BECAME LOOSE FROM ITS UPWARD POSITION AND RELEASED TO AN UNSTABLE DOWNWARD POSITION. THIS SUDDEN OBSTRUCTION NEARLY RESULTED IN AN ACCIDENT AS THE VISOR BLOCKED THE DRIVER'S VIEW WHILE THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION. DRIVER WAS ABLE TO AVOID A COLLISION, BUT WAS REQUIRED TO HOLD THE VISOR OUT OF THE WAY BEFORE BEING ABLE TO PULL OVER AND TRY TO MANEUVER VISOR UPWARDS TO LOCK IN PLACE TO NO SUCCESS. DRIVER AT THAT POINT HAD TO REMOVE VISOR FOR SAFETY REASONS. PASSENGER VISOR ALREADY FELL OFF EARLIER ON ITS OWN AND NOW THE DRIVER'S SIDE HAS BEEN REMOVED; VEHICLE NO LONGER HAS SUN VISORS. VEHICLE OPERATOR LIVES IN CENTRAL ARIZONA WITH CONSISTENTLY \"VERY HIGH\" UV INDEX. THE LOSS OF VISORS MAKES THIS CAR DIFFICULT TO DRIVE DURING DAYTIME, EVEN WITH INDEPENDENT EYE PROTECTION (IE: SUNGLASSES) AS WELL AS WITH HE VISORS' UNRELIABILITY TO REMAIN ATTACHED TO THE CAR'S INTERIOR.",
