THE LOCAL COOPER TIRE DEALER AND COOPER MANUFACTURER ARE DENYING THESE ISSUES. THEY BOTH STATE IT IS THE WAY THE SHOP IS MOUNTING AND BALANCING THE TIRES. IF THAT WAS THE CASE, WE WOULD HAVE ISSUES WITH GOODYEAR, FIRESTONE, BF GOODRICH, CONTINENTAL, ETC TIRES. THE COOPER MANUFACTURER IS TRYING TO SAY THAT THE COOPER CS 5 TIRES ARE SENSITIVE. AS STATED SHOPS FROM KANSAS, FLORIDA, NEW YORK, ETC ARE COMPLAINING OF THE SAME ISSUE",
