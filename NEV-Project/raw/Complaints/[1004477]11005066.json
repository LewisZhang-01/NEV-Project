MORE RECENTLY MY CAR TRIED TO ACCELERATE A COUPLE TIMES WHILE MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE.  I TOOK IT INTO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE IT REPAIRED AND THEY STATED BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT MAKE THE CAR DO THE SAME THING, THEY COULD NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.    SECOND THE RECALL ON THE AIR BAGS AND SEAT BELTS WAS FIRST PUBLISHED ALMOST A YEAR AGO.  THIS IS MY ONLY VEHICLE AND I HAVE TWO CHILDREN THAT ARE PLACED IN THAT VEHICLE.  I AM SCARED FOR THEM AS WELL AS ANYONE THAT IS IN MY CAR IF I AM TO GET INTO AN ACCIDENT.  THIS IS FAR TOO LONG TO KNOW ABOUT A PROBLEM AND NOT FIX IT.    I WAS GOING TO TRADE IN MY CAR AND TRY TO LEASE ANOTHER VEHICLE.  WELL NOW I CAN NOT DO THAT AS MY CAR IS ONLY WORTH ABOUT $5,000 EVEN THOUGH IT IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.  I STILL OWE ABOUT $12,000.  SO NOW I AM LEFT TO DRIVE AN UNSAFE CAR THAT IS KNOWN TO BE UNSAFE AND NOTHING IS BEING DONE ABOUT IT.",
