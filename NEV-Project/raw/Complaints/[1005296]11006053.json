WHEN I PICKED UP A NAIL IN ONE TIRE, THE WARNING LIGHT NEVER CAME ON EVEN THOUGH THE TIRE PRESSURE DROPPED BY OVER 50%. WHEN THE WARNING LIGHT DOES COME ON, I CHECK ALL TIRES AND THEY ARE ALL FINE - EVERY TIME. AFTER MULTIPLE FRUSTRATING TRIPS TO DEALER, THE BEST THEY COULD DO WAS A SOFTWARE UPDATE. NOW INSTEAD OF FALSE WARNINGS 3 -4 TIMES A MONTH, NOW I GET FALSE WARNINGS 3 - 4 TIMES A YEAR. BUT THE WARNINGS ARE ALWAYS FALSE! LIKE THE LITTLE BOY THAT KEEPS CRYING WOLF, THIS SYSTEM IS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE IN THAT OWNERS WILL BEGIN TO IGNORE THE WARNING SYSTEM ALTOGETHER.",
