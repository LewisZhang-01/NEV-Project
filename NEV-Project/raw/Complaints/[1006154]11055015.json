I WAS IN THE STAPLES PARKING LOT LAST NIGHT AROUND 8:00 PM IN BURLINGTON MA, I WAS LOADED IN MY NEW PRINTER WHICH I HAD BOUGHT AT STAPLES, WHEN SUDDENLY WITHOUT WARNING THE TRUNK LID LET GO AND CAME DOWN ON ME AND CONKED ME ON THE HEAD HARD. TEMPORARILY AFTER THE DIRECT HEAD HIT, I FELT DIZZY FOR A MINUTE, AND I COULD TASTE BLOOD TEMPORARILY FOR SEVERAL HOURS AFTERWARD. I FEEL OK NOW. THIS ALSO IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED ON MY 2013 FORD TAURUS. I FEEL AS IF THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD WHEN LOADING AND UNLOADING THE VEHICLE'S TRUNK. THE LID IS HELD UP BY A STRUT SYSTEM SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE HOOD. THE TRUNK LID HOLD OPEN OFTEN QUITS AFTER IT IS FULLY OPEN AND IN THE UPRIGHT POSITION. I FEEL THAT THIS IS DANGEROUS, THERE SHOULD BE AN INVESTIGATION AND A RECALL ON FORD TAURUS TRUNKS. THIS HAS SERIOUS POTENTIAL FOR A CONCUSSION, INTERNAL BLEEDING, SERIOUS INJURY ETC.",
