EACH TIME I WOULD SHUT THE ENGINE OFF, RESTART THE VEHICLE, AND THE PROBLEM WAS RECTIFIED. ON JUNE 1, 2017, THE SAME PROBLEM OCCURRED BUT THIS TIME THE POWER STEERING NEVER RETURNED.  I CALLED A FORD DEALER AND EXPLAINED THE PROBLEM AND A SERVICE TECHNICIAN GAVE ME A SUGGESTION TO DISCONNECT AND THEN CONNECT THE BATTERY.  THIS DID NOT HELP.  I BROUGHT THE CAR INTO THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR AND THEY FOUND THE WHOLE STEERING ASSEMBLY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED COSTING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF $1750.  AFTER READING NUMEROUS REPORTS OF THE SAME PROBLEM ON THE INTERNET I DECIDED TO FILE A COMPLAINT TO FORD AND ALSO TO ANY CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCIES.",
