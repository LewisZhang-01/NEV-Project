        "summary": "WHEN I FIRST PURCHASED MY CAMRY, I NOTICED THE DASHBOARD WAS VERY SHINY AND I THOUGHT MAYBE THAT WAS DUE TO THE DEALERSHIP CLEANING IT UP FOR ME BECAUSE I JUST PURCHASED IT. OVER TIME I NOTICED THAT THE SHINE STARTED TO BECOME AN ISSUE WITH ME WHILE DRIVING ESPECIALLY DURING THE HOT AND SUNNY TIME FRAME OF THE DAY. SO ONE DAY I DECIDED TO TAKE MY HAND AND JUST RUB THE DASH TO SEE IF IT'LL TAKE SOME OF THE SHINE AWAY AND AS SOON AS I TOUCHED IT MY HAND GOT STUCK AND BURNT FROM THE HEAT OF THE \"STICKY DASHBOARD\" SO WHEN I GOT HOME I DECIDED TO TRY AND CLEAN IT WITH SOME SOAP AND WATER TO SEE IF IT'LL REMOVE THE STICKINESS AND UNFORTUNATELY IT DIDN'T WORK. MY COUSIN HAS THE SAME CAR AND I CALLED HER TO SEE WHAT I SHOULD DO AND MUCH TO HER AMAZEMENT SHE DISCLOSED WITH ME THAT SHE IS HAVING THE SAME ISSUE WITH HER 2007 CAMRY AS WELL. SO I TOOK MY CAR TO A GUY WHO DETAILS CARS AND NOT ONLY DID HE STATE THAT HE HAS SEEN THIS PROBLEM BEFORE ON THE 2007 CAMRY'S BUT HE HAS SEEN THE SAME ISSUE ON THIS SPECIFIC CAR IN OTHER STATES BECAUSE HE WAS FROM NY AND ALSO LIVED IN GEORGIA AND DETAILED CARS IN THOSE STATES AS WELL. THIS HAS BECOME A NUISANCE NOW BECAUSE IT IS BLINDING ME AS I DRIVE UNLESS I PUT A CLOTH OVER MY DASH AND THEN I HAVE TROUBLE REMOVING IT BECAUSE IT IS LITERALLY GLUED DOWN TO IT AFTER THE FACT. MY DAUGHTER UNBEKNOWNST TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS HOT DECIDED TO REACH UP AND WIPE IT SO THE GLARE WOULD GO AWAY AS WELL AND SHE BURNT HER HAND TOO. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THIS NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED AND A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED AS THIS IS DEFINITELY A DEFECT ON THESE CARS.",
