        "summary": "While slowing down to make a right turn the engine stalled and the electrical power was lost rendering the power steering inoperable. The loss of power steering created a dangerous situation where I almost hit a tree. Also there has been several occasions while driving on the freeway the electrical power stalled. Thankfully it was only for less than two seconds, but I can't imagine what would have happened on a busy freeway had it not been only a temporary loss of power. I read online that these problems are not uncommon. I have taken the truck to a Chevy dealer where they replaced battery cables they said had some resistance in them. It's been a month since the repair ($1300 later) was made and have not experienced any problem since. After experiencing these \"power failers\", there would be a message on the dash that would state \"OPEN THEN CLOSE DRIVER WINDOW'",
