WHEN IN DOWN POSITION, SEAT PUSHES HEAD FORWARD; WHEN IT IS UP, IT'S TOO TALL FOR THE HEAD.  ALSO HEADREST IS VERY DIFFICULT TO PULL UP.  BASICALLY, THIS PART IS NOT USEABLE BY ANYONE EXCEPT A VERY TALL PERSON.  SHOULD BE REPLACED BY MERCEDES.  INJURIES CAN OCCUR DUE TO THIS DESIGN.  NO INCIDENT HAS OCCURRED; ONLY COMPLAINTS ABOUT USING THE HEAD REST.",
