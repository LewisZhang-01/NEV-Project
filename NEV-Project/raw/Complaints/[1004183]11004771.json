THAT WAS 2 YEARS AGO. EVERY TIME I GO TO HAVE MAINTENANCE DONE I ASK ABOUT THIS RECALL AND WHEN CAN I EXPECT IT TO BE DONE....HOPEFULLY BEFORE IT KILLS ME!!! I LIVE IN ALPHARETTA, GA AND THE TRAFFIC IS AS BAD AS EVERYONE SAYS. ACCIDENTS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME. I WOULD HATE THAT MY DEATH OCCURRED BECAUSE FORD DIDN'T REPLACE FAULTY PARTS.",
