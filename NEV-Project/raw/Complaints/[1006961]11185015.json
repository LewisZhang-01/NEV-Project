        "summary": "412.8 MILES AFTER HAVING J02 VALVE SPRING RECALL WORK PERFORMED, WHILE DRIVING, THE VEHICLE BEGAN MAKING A TICKING NOISE.  WITHIN 2 MINUTES OF DRIVING, THIS ESCALATED TO LOUD METALLIC KNOCKING.  I PULLED OVER IMMEDIATELY AND HAD MY VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP THAT PERFORMED THE RECALL WORK.  THAT WAS ON FEBRUARY 18TH, AT 9 AM IN 2019.  MY VEHICLE HAS 53,610 MILES.  IT IS NOW MARCH 8TH, 2019.  THE DEALERSHIP STILL HAS TAKEN NO ACTION AFTER DETERMINING THAT ROD BEARING #4 WAS SPUN.  I HAVE BEEN OFFERED NO RENTAL, I HAVE TO CALL MULTIPLE TIMES TO SPEAK WITH SOMEBODY.      TOYOTA CUSTOMER CARE SAYS THAT THIS IS NOT A RECALL ISSUE, BUT A WORKMANSHIP FAILURE, AND TO WORK WITH THE DEALERSHIP.  THE DEALERSHIP SAYS TO WORK WITH CUSTOMER CARE.  AT THE DEALERSHIP, MY PARTS ARE ALL THROWN ON THE FLOOR, INCLUDING A BRAND NEW CLUTCH THEY HAD JUST INSTALLED.  THERE IS NOW DIRT AND SALTWATER BEING KICKED ONTO MY PARTS THAT WOULD BE REUSED, AND IT'S INFURIATING TO SEE MY STUFF BEING TREATED THIS WAY.    MY WIFE AND I HAVE BEEN HAVING TO SHARE OUR ONLY OTHER VEHICLE AND ARE SO TERRIBLY INCONVENIENCED THAT I AM LOSING SLEEP AND NOT EATING WELL.  ALL I WANT IS FOR TOYOTA TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE ENGINE, OR COMPENSATE ME TO PAY ANOTHER FACILITY TO DO THE WORK.  I HAVE AN ESTIMATE READY AND A SHOP WILLING TO DO THE WORK IMMEDIATELY.    PLEASE HELP.",
