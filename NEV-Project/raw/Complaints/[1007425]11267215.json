THIS IS A PRETTY COMMON PROBLEM AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL AT LEAST, IF THEY ARE NOT GOING TO COVER IT UNDER WARRANTY. REPAIRS ARE ASTRONOMICALLY EXPENSIVE. I WAS QUOTED MORE THAN 7000 DOLLARS TO FIX THE PROBLEM. WHEN THE PROBLEM OCCURED, THE BRAKES BECOME UNUSABLE AND THE CAR HAD TO BE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP. I THINK HYUNDAI AND ITS DEALERS SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS TYPE OF FAILURE.",
