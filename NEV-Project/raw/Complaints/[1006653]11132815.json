        "summary": "WITH MY SMARTPHONE CONNECTED TO THE AUDIO/INFORMATION SCREEN (INFOTAINMENT PANEL) VIA USB PORT IN THE CENTER CONSOLE FOR THE USE OF IOS MAPS FOR NAVIGATION, I RECEIVED AN INCOMING PHONE CALL. THE VOLUME OF THE RING THROUGH THE VEHICLE SPEAKERS WAS SO LOUD THAT MY BODY INSTINCTIVELY AND INVOLUNTARILY REMOVED MY HANDS FROM THE STEERING WHEEL TO PROTECT MY EARS BY COVERING THEM. AT THAT POINT, I HAD COMPLETELY LOST CONTROL OF THE MOVING VEHICLE! IT CREATED AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS SITUATION.    AFTER RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM LATER, I FOUND THAT THE VOLUME OF INCOMING CALLS IS A FUNCTION OF THE VEHICLE; NOT THE SMART PHONE WHEN USED IN THIS FASHION. THE VOLUME MUST BE ADJUSTED BY USE OF THE INFOTAINMENT PANEL VOLUME KNOB (OR MAYBE STEERING WHEEL VOLUME ADJUST?) WHILE THE CALL IS INCOMING.     TO HAVE THE DEFAULT INCOMING CALL SETTING AT A VOLUME LEVEL THAT WOULD CAUSE A DRIVER'S HANDS TO INVOLUNTARILY COVER THEIR EARS WHILE IN MOTION SEEMS TO BE RECKLESS ENDANGERMENT. I WAS NOT ADVISED VERBALLY OR IN WRITING THAT THIS VOLUME WOULD NEED TO BE ADJUSTED OR THAT IT COULD CAUSE A HAZARDOUS CONDITION. MY HEARING HAS NEVER SEEMED OVERLY SENSITIVE TO LOUD NOISE.",
