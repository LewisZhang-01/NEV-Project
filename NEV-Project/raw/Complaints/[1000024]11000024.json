AS I SAFELY GOT OFF THE ROAD I HAD WAITED FOR CARS TO PASS BY BEFORE I TRIED TO RE EMERGE ONTO THE ROAD AND THERE WAS NO RESPONSE TO A FULL PRESS OF THE GAS PEDAL AND THE VEHICLE WOULD ONLY GO APPROX. 1 MILE HR. I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND WAS ABOUT TO CALL A TOW TRUCK AND I DECIDED TO TURN THE VEHICLE BACK ON AND I PUT IT IN DRIVE AND IT LET ME DRIVE WITH NO ISSUES. AFTER MY INCIDENT I WENT HOME TO GOOGLE THE SYMPTOMS IT APPEARED TO BE A COMMON PROBLEM WITH FORD VEHICLES. HOW EVER UNDER THE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM MY VEHICLE WAS NOT LISTED BUT YET HAS THE SAME ISSUES. I WOULD LIKE TO START AN INVESTIGATION IN THIS MATTER AS SAME OTHER CONSUMERS MIGHT NOT BE AS SKILLFULLY OF A DRIVER AS MYSELF AND POSSIBLY CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH OVER THIS ISSUE.",
