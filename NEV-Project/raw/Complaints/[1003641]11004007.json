        "summary": "WHEN DRIVING MY ROGUE FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME OVER 40 MINUTES ON THE EXPRESSWAY THE VEHICLES STARTS TO DECELERATE EVEN WHEN THE GAS PEDAL TO PUSHED ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FLOOR. THIS SEEMS TO BE WORSE IN THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN IT IS WARMER OUTSIDE. THE CAR NEEDS TO BE SHUT OFF FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE IT WILL BEGIN TO ACCELERATE AND MAINTAIN THE SPEED ON THE EXPRESSWAY. I HAVE EVEN TURNED ON THE CRUISE CONTROL AND THE VEHICLE WILL EVEN DECELERATE WHEN THE SPEED IS SET ON CRUISE CONTROL. THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING ESPECIALLY SINCE I LIVE IN FL AND TO HAVE TO PULL OVER EVERY 40 MINUTES WHEN DRIVING LONGER DISTANCES AND SIT IN YOUR HOT CAR ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. THIS STARTED BACK IN 2015 AND HAPPENS ALMOST EVERY TIME I HAVE TO DRIVE OVER 40 MINUTES ON THE EXPRESSWAY.",
