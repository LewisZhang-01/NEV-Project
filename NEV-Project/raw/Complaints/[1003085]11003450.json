HAVE CALLED TOYOTA DIRECTLY ON 03/08/17 (CASE # 1703082418) AND CONTACTED MY LOCAL DEALER ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS ONLY TO DISCOVER THEY STILL HAD NO SOLUTION TO THE ISSUE.     GOT TIRED OF WAITING AND WANTED TO PURCHASE A NEW VEHICLE THAT MY FAMILY CAN RIDE IN TOGETHER. WENT TO TRADE IN THIS VEHICLE ON 07/01/17 AND THE DEALER UNDERCUT MY FAIR TRADE IN PRICE BY $5,000 STATING THE OUTSTANDING RECALL WAS A DANGER TO A FUTURE OWNER AND THAT THEY COULDN'T SELL THE VEHICLE WITH A KNOWN SAFETY HAZARD.     EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED THAT TOYOTA HASN'T FOUND A SOLUTION TO THIS KNOWN ISSUE FOR OVER A YEAR. NOW IT'S COST ME THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.",
