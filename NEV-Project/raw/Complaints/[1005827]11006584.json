IT WAS REPLACED AND WITHIN SEVERAL WEEKS THE \"NEW ACTUATOR \" ALSO FRIED. WAS TOLD THAT THE COMPUTER SYSTEM WOULD SHUT IT DOWN BUT THE UNIT CONTINUES TO RUN EVEN WHEN THE CAR WAS TURNED OFF!  WITH THE UNIT BEING IN THE TRUNK IT'S A MIRACLE THAT THE CAR DID NOT CATCH ON FIRE. IN ORDER TO REPAIR THIS UNIT, AND HOPEFULLY THEY MUST REMOVE ALL DOORS HEAD REST AND SEATS CHECK ALL VACUUM LINES TO FIND OUT WHICH ONE IS LEAKING, AND OR REPLACE ALL VACUUM LINES, AND PRAY THAT WORKS, THE MINIMUM COST OF THIS IS OVER $5000.00 DOLLARS! NOT ONLY IS THIS A FIRE HAZARD WAITING TO BLOW UP, NOT BEING ABLE TO LOCK OR UNLOCK YOUR DOORS. THE DEALERSHIP SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE TO REPAIR THIS SHORTY/ I'LL BUILT PART! BEFORE SOMEONE IS HURT OR KILLED BY THIS UNIT.    ALSO AS I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD MY RIGHT STRUT ASSEMBLY BROKE. I LOOKED UP RECALL INFO, THERE WAS A RECALL ON THAT , BUT WAS TOLD NOT FOR MY VIN! JUST ANOTHER SAFETY HAZARD FOR THE 2006 S430! DOES SOMEONE HAVE TO DIE FIRST?",
