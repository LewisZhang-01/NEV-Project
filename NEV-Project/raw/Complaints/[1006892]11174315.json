I TRIED TO RESTART IT AND IT WOULDN'T TURN OVER. I CALLED FOR A TOW TRUCK AND THEY LOOKED IT OVER THE NEXT DAY AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD DROPPED ALL OF MY OIL, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 1/2 QUART, THE MECHANIC THEN TOLD ME THAT THE PCV PIPE WAS PLUGGED AND FORCED A LEAK AND BLEW CAUSING MY CAR TO LOSE ALL OF IT'S OIL. HE IS NOT A GMC DEALER SO HE CALLED THE NEAREST ONE, MCGRATH (FORMERLY BIRD CHEVROLET) IN DUBUQUE, IOWA AND THEY SAID THAT THAT HAS HAPPENED AND THERE WAS A RECALL ON THEM AND THAT THE CAR SHOULD BE TOWED THERE FOR REPAIR. ONCE THE MECHANIC AT MCGRATH, (RANDY) HAD TAKEN A LOOK AT THE CAR AND RAN MY VIN # HE STATED THAT MY CAR WOULD NOT BE COVERED, EVEN THOUGH THIS SAME THING IS PART OF A RECALL FOR THE SAME MAKE /MODEL/YEAR OF MY VEHICLE. HE SAID THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET FOR THE MALFUNCTIONING OF THIS PART. SO FAR I HAVE HAD TO PAY FOR EMERGENCY TOWING, TOWING TO THE DEALER, AND DIAGNOSTIC TESTING, TOTALING $350.00 AND THERE'S BEEN NOTHING DONE YET TO MY VEHICLE.",
