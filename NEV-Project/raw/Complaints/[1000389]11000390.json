        "summary": "I BOUGHT MY JEEP BRAND NEW ZERO MILES, CURRENTLY ITS AT 28K. I BEGAN TO HEAR A FLAPPING NOISE WHEN SHES ON IDLE AND THE AUTO SHUT OFF ISNT ON AND WHEN I START TO DRIVE THE NOISE GOES AWAY. LATER I NOTICED THAT ON START POINT THE ACCELERATOR EITHER GETS STUCK OR IT  MAKES THE STARTING JOLT AS IF I GASSED IN THE PEDAL ALL THE WAY. WHEN IM ON THE FREEWAY AND I LET GO OF THE GAS PEDAL THE SPEED WONT DECREASE I'D HAVE TO USE THE BRAKE PEDAL, OBVIOUSLY THE SPEED WONT DECREASE IF IM GOING DOWNHILL, THIS IS WHEN IM ON A FLAT WAYWARD. THESE SYMPTOMS WITH THE EXCLUSION OF THE FLAPPING NOISE ON IDLE, HAPPEN ONLY OCCASIONALLY. MY JEEP IS ONLY ONE YEAR OLD I MAINTAIN IT VERY REGULARLY ROTATE TIRES, FLUIDS, THE WORKS. I TOOK HER TO THE DEALERSHIP AND IM HOPING A  GOOD DIAGNOSTIC AND A GOOD FIX, BECAUSE SINCE IT HAPPENS ON OCCASIONS I DON'T WANT TO BRING MY JEEP BACK AND CONTINUE THE SAME ISSUE, IT COULD BE A SAFETY HAZARD, SHES OUR ONLY FAMILY CAR AND IF SOMETHING GOES BYPASSED, UNFORTUNATE EVENTS MAY  TAKE PLACE, (GOD FORBID,) AND THIS ISSUE CAN BE SPOTTED RIGHT AWAY, I WILL HAVE PEACE OF IN MIND.",
