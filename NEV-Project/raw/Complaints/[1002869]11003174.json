A LOT OF MONEY LOSS IN BATTERIES AND TIME LOST IN STANDING IN SOMETIMES SNOW OR RAIN FOR MINUTES TRYING TO GET IT TO REGISTER. ALSO, I HAVE CHILDREN AND WOULD PREFER MY CHILD IS UNABLE TO OPEN THEIR DOOR WHILE IN MOTION. PURCHASED THE CAR USED IN NOVEMBER 2015 AND IT STARTED MALFUNCTIONING AFTER A MONTH. I FIND IT SHOCKING THAT THERE IS NOT A RECALL ON THIS. IT IS AN OBVIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND VERY WELL KNOWN WITH DEALERSHIPS AND REPAIR SHOPS, BUT THE FIXING PRICE IS AROUND $500.",
