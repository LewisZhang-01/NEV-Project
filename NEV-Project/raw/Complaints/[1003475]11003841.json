        "summary": "THE GAS GAUGE DROPS TO ABSOLUTE ZERO AND THE LOW FUEL WARNING COMES ON EVEN THOUGH THERE IS PLENTY OF GAS IN THE TANK. THIS CAUSES A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WITH THE CODE U1403. THERE ARE MANY OWNERS OF 2004-2007 CHRYSLER PACIFICAS THAT HAVE THIS EXACT SAME PROBLEM. THE GENERAL CONSENSUS ON FORUMS SPECIFIC TO THIS COMMON PROBLEM IS THERE IS A GAS PRESSURE PROBLEM THAT CAUSES THE GAUGE TO NOT READ CORRECTLY. PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN THEIR CAR TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR REPORT THAT THE DEALERS USUALLY SAY THE SOLUTION IS TO REPLACE BOTH FUEL PUMPS. CUSTOMERS, HOWEVER, REPORT THAT THIS IS EXPENSIVE AND USUALLY DOES NOT FIX THE PROBLEM (CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STAYS ON). MOST OWNERS SAY THE PROBLEM STEMS FROM THE POORLY DESIGNED SADDLE TANK AND BELIEVE THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE GAS PRESSURE. I CONTACTED CHRYSLER AND THEY WERE NO HELP AT ALL. TWO SEPARATE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS TOLD ME TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER. THERE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF 2004-2007 PACIFICA OWNERS (I ALSO FOUND MANY JEEP FORUMS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM) AND SURELY CHRYSLER HAS A RECORD OF THESE PROBLEMS AND HOW TO FIX THEM. HAVING EACH OWNER TAKE THEIR CAR TO THEIR LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALER WITH NO COMMON DOCUMENTED FIX MEANS EACH OWNER IS RELYING ON TECHS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM AND THE PROPER WAY TO FIX IT.  TRIAL AND ERROR EACH TIME IS EXTREMELY WASTEFUL AND EXPENSIVE FOR THOUSANDS OF OWNERS. A RECALL WOULD AT LEAST ENSURE THAT EACH SERVICE CENTER HAS THE CORRECT INSTRUCTIONS ON WHAT IS EXACTLY WRONG AND PRECISELY HOW TO FIX IT.",
