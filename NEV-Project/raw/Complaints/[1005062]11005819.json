WE HAD BEEN ON VACATION AND FIGURED THE CAR HAD SAT FOR 10 DAYS WITHOUT BEING DRIVEN AND JUST NEEDED A CHARGE. THE LIGHT INDICATOR CAME AND WENT BEFORE THE CAR STARTED DOING WEIRD THINGS: HAZARD LIGHTS, WINDSHIELD WIPERS, SEATBELT LIGHT, ETC. THE CAR QUICKLY LOST POWER AND EVERYTHING LOCKED UP LEAVING US STRANDED ON THE SIDE OF A GRAVEL ROAD. WE COULDN'T EVEN RELEASE THE KEYS FROM THE IGNITION. THERE WAS A BURNING SMELL AND THE CAR HAD TO BE TOWED. THE ALTERNATOR WENT OUT, IN TURN BURNING UP THE EMS SYSTEM. THIS PART IS ON NATIONAL BACK ORDER. WE HAVE BEEN WITHOUT A CAR FOR OVER TWO WEEKS NOW. THE RECALL FOR THE ALTERNATOR WAS FOR A SMALLER AMP. OURS IS A 220AMP. THEY ARE TELLING US PRODUCTION OF THE PART MAY TAKE UP TO 10-12 MORE DAYS.",
