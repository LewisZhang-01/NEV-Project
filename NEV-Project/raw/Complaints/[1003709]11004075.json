GENERALLY, THE ENGINE WILL STALL IF IDLING AT A STOP LIGHT AFTER FILLUP.  THE ENGINE DOES NOT STALL IF THE VEHICLE IS RUNNING ABOVE 25-30 MILES PER HOUR.  THE ENGINE STARTS RIGHT BACK UP WITHOUT PROBLEM, BUT WILL CONTINUE TO STALL.  AFTER VEHICLE HAS BEEN DRIVEN A FEW MILES, THE STALLING ISSUE DISAPPEARS ENTIRELY.",
