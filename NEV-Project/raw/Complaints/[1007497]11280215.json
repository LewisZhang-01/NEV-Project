        "summary": "THE POWER STEERING WAS INOPERATIVE  WHEN  STATIONARY AND THE VEHICLE WAS PARKED OVERNIGHT IN MY GARAGE AND  TEMP WAS BELOW FREEZING. THE STEERING WAS LOCKED UP AND YOU COULD NOT TURN THE STEERING WHEEL. AFTER THE VEHICLE WAS RUNNING FOR ABOUT 20 TO 30 MINUTES (TRYING TO MOVE STEERING WHEEL BACK & FORTH) IT WOULD LET YOU THEN TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL. IT DID THIS 3 TIMES AND I HAD A FORD DEALER CHECK IT OUT. THEY REPLACED THE STEERING SECTOR AND IT REPAIRED THE PROBLEM. ONE OF THE TIMES THE STEERING LOCKED UP IT ALSO WAS BINDING WHEN I STARTED MOVING AND TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL. I FEEL IF THE STEERING SECTOR FAILED IN ABOUT 4 YEARS IS SAFETY ITEM AND SHOULD BE RECALLED AND OWNERS REFUNDED FOR THIS TYPE OF FAILURE. IT COST ABOUT $2300.00 TO HAVE IT REPAIRED. IF THIS FAILURE HAPPENED WHEN DRIVING I WOULD HAVE LOST 100% OF THE STEERING.",
