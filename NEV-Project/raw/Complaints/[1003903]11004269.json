THE VEHICLE WILL DRIFT EITHER TO THE LEFT OR TO THE RIGHT, BUT IT WILL NOT GO STRAIGHT WITHOUT CONSTANT CORRECTIONS. IN SHORT, THE STEERING SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE A CENTER.    THE AUTHORIZED DEALER'S CERTIFIED TECHNICIAN TEST DROVE THE VEHICLE AND CONFIRMED THE ISSUE. THEY UNSUCCESSFULLY TRIED TO REPAIR IT WITH WHEEL ALIGNMENT AND EPS RECALIBRATION. THEN THEY SAID THAT THEY TEST DROVE A SIMILAR VEHICLE AND IT EXHIBITS THE SAME STEERING ISSUE AND THUS THEY CALLED IT \"A NORMAL CHARACTERISTIC OF THE ELECTRIC STEERING\".    I HAVE CONTACTED BMW NA ABOUT THE ISSUE AND THE DEALER'S STATEMENT THAT THIS STEERING ISSUE IS A NORMAL CHARACTERISTIC. BMW NA HAS NOT PROVIDED ANY TECHNICAL GUIDANCE OR OPINION AND THEY REDIRECT ME BACK TO THE DEALER. THEIR OVERALL VERDICT IS THAT IF MORE THAN ONE VEHICLES EXHIBIT THE ISSUE, THEN IT IS NORMAL, AND THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO.    NHTSA SHOULD INVESTIGATE IF X3 MODELS WITH ELECTRIC STEERING HAVE THIS STEERING ISSUE AND POSSIBLY ASK BMW TO RECALL BECAUSE IT IS A BIG SAFETY ISSUE.",
