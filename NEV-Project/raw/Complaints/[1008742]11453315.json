The sudden breaking of the vehicle with no reason or cause surprised me and put me in a dangerous position that could have resulted in an accident. Luckily the vehicle behind me was far enough behind where it was able to break without rear ending me. There was no warning that the vehicle had sense something on the road (none which were visible to me) before slamming the breaks. I will be reporting this to the dealer, but it has occurred twice before and I\u2019ve always been told they don\u2019t see any issues on there side, only been told to write down time, road conditions and location where it occurred so they could look into the system next time.",
