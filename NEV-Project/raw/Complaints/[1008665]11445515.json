        "summary": "There is no way for the driver of the car to put the transmission into neutral if needed with an electrical/battery failure.  According to Honda, there is a special mechanical device that tow truck drivers would have that physically attaches to the engine to shift the car into neutral.  In addition, the honda mechanic that I talked to today said even if the average driver had one of these devices, they would not recommend they use it due to likelihood of causing damage to the engine or transmission.  This is fine if the car is already in park, since it would most likely be located in a parking lot, residence, etc.  The two times that would be a safety issue and could very easily cause an accident would be if the car was in drive, stopped at a traffic light with the engine off due to the  Auto Start/Stop feature, and suffered a battery failure, preventing the engine from starting.  Now the car would not be able to start, but more importantly couldn't even be pushed off to the side of the road and clear the intersection, since there is no way to move it into neutral.  Another example could be with an alternator failure while driving, where the battery then surges and drains itself, with the engine and car now shut down.  If you are unable to move the car to the side of the road as this is happening, maybe stuck in traffic or stopped at a traffic light, the car is now unmovable until a tow truck driver arrives and installs this mechanical neutral unlock device. There should be a way with an electrical problem to be able to place the car into neutral and move it.  Otherwise, this turns a routine auto problem (that has had an acceptable solution) into a true safety issue, both for occupants and other vehicles and their operators.",
