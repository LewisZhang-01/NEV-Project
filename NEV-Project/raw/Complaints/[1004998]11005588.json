THE AIR BAG LIGHT FLASHES DUE TO THE SIDES WALL AND DASH BOARD AIR BAG IS COMING OUT.I WOULD HATE TO HIT A SQUIRREL AND IT THE AIR BAG POPS. I HAVE ONE WINDOW THAT REFUSES TO COME DOWN AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, THE DANG CRUISE CONTROL ONLY SETS AFTER 80MPH. I HVE TO PRAY EVERYDAY NOT TO GET A SPEEDING TICKET IN LOW SPEEDING AREAS AND THE DASH BOARD WITH THE SHARP EDGES WILL NOT CAUSE MORE INJURIES THAN THE AIRBAG IF I'M EVER IN AN ACCIDENT. PLEASE COME TO SOME TYPE OF AGREEMENT FOE A RECALL TO FIX THIS MATTER. PRETTY TRUCK OUTSIDE BUT THE INSIDE CLEAN, CRACK, AND BROKE UP AS IS IT WAS A FIGHT INSIDE.HELP HELP HELP BRING IT BACK TO LIFE",
