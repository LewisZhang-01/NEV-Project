WHEN I DID, THE REAR AXLE SNAPPED ALMOST CAUSING ME TO CRASH. AFTER LOOKING FOR THE COST TO REPLACE THE AXLE, I CAME UPON A FORD RECALL. WHEN I PLACED MY VIN IN THE COMPUTER IT CAME UP THAT MY 2002 FORD WINDSTAR WAS IN FACT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL. I TALKED TO SOMEONE AT FORD VIA LIVE CHAT ON SATURDAY AFTER HAVING THE VEHICLE TOWED HOME AND THEY STATED THAT THE RECALL WAS OUTSTANDING AND I NEEDED TO CALL THE FORD DEALERSHIP. I PAID AGAIN TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP. NOW TUESDAY MORNING JULY 18TH 2017, BOTH THE DEALERSHIP AND FORD IS SAYING THAT THEY CANT HELP ME AND I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF REPLACING THE COMPLETELY RUSTED REAR AXLE. THE RUST CAUSING THE AXLE TO SNAP WAS THE REASON FOR THE RECALL IN THE FIRST PLACE. I HAVE OWNED THIS VEHICLE LESS THAN 6 MONTHS AND NOW AS A SINGLE MOM AM LEFT WITHOUT A VEHICLE. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER FORD AGAIN IN MY LIFE AND I WILL ALSO DISCOURAGE MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY FROM PURCHASING FORDS AS WELL.",
