MY MECHANIC RAN A DIAGNOSTIC TEST AND ITS COMING UP WITH A SECURITY CODE ISSUE STATING MY KEY DOES NOT READ BUT WILL START SEVERAL MINUTES AFTER ATTEMPT. THIS HAS JUST RANDOMLY STARTED HAPPENING AND I HAVE READ MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS IN FORD FORUMS STATING THE SAME SITUATION. ALL LIGHTS ON DASH AND RADIO COME ON BUT CAR HAS NO NOISE AND REFUSES TO START. I THOUGHT IT WAS MY BATTERY OR STARTER AND MY MECHANIC HAS CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS NEITHER. I TRIED CONTACTING THE FORD DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT THIS CAR AND THEY REFUSE TO FIX IT OR EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE ISSUE. THIS MAKE HAS HAD MORE ISSUES THAN I HAVE EVER HAD WITH ANY VEHICLE I HAVE EVER OWNED. FORD NEEDS TO STEP UP BECAUSE THIS IS RIDICULOUS. MY HUSBAND HAS THE SAME VEHICLE AND HIS TRANSMISSION IS ALSO ON NATIONWIDE RECALL BACKORDER FOR THE SAME MAKE AND MODEL. THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD A WARNING FOR CONSUMERS THAT THIS WAS A TERRIBLE PRODUCTION YEAR.",
