        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING JEEP CHEROKEE LATITUDE I HAVE NOTICED THAT WITHIN FIRST 10 MINUTES OF DRIVING JEEP START GETTING FLICKERING LIGHTS AND THEN AFTER 5-10 SECONDS COMPLETELY SHUTS OFF. ABSOLUTELY OUT, I CANNOT EVEN PUT AN EMERGENCY LIGHTS ON WHEN IT STOPS TO INDICATE THAT I HAVE PROBLEM. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE AN OLD BATTERY BUT I HAVE REPLACED THE BATTERY FEW DAYS AGO AND THE PROBLEM STARTED AGAIN. THE WORST IS THAT WHILE IT HAPPENS, POWER STEERING AND EVERYTHING ELSE COMPLETELY SHUTS. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AS I CANNOT PULL ON THE SITE OR AS I SAID PUT EMERGENCY LIGHTS ON.. ONE DAY I HAVE DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY WHILE THE CAR STOPPED, FOR A MINUTE OR TWO. I GUESS THAT CUT POWER FROM THE JEEP'S COMPUTER AS WELL. AFTER TWO MINUTES OR SO WHEN I RECONNECTED THE BATTERY AGAIN, I WANTED TO START THE CAR. AFTER A FEW CRANKS I COULD START THE CAR. THE SITUATION I HAVE JUST DESCRIBED IS MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE. YET, WHEN I RUN RECALLS USING THE VIN # OF MY CAR I SEE NO RECALLS. I HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED THE JEEP DEALER ASKING WHAT COULD BE THE PROBLEM. THEY JUST TOLD ME THAT NO RECALL IS AVAILABLE. I WOULD LIKE TO DOCUMENT THIS FOR OTHERS TO BE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM AS WELL AS DOCUMENT IF THERE IS GOING MAJOR INCIDENTS.",
