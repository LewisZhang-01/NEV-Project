        "summary": "AFTER FRONT BRAKE PAD AND BOTH ROTOR REPLACEMENT, THE VEHICLE BRAKE PEDAL HAD EXCESSIVE TRAVEL TO NEAR THE FLOORBOARD.  BRAKING WAS DEGRADED WITH A SLIGHT INITIAL PULL TO THE RIGHT FOLLOWED BY STRAIGHT STEADY STOP, BUT WITH MORE PEDAL PRESSURE AND TRAVEL THAN NORMAL... ALMOST LIKE NO POWER BRAKES.  THE FORD DEALER (SEE ATTACHMENT) PERFORMED AN ABS TEST AFTER PAD AND ROTOR REPLACEMENT, THUS ACTIVATING THE HYDRAULIC CONTROL UNIT, WHICH, IF YOU STUDY THE SCHEMATIC, WILL PLACE ONE OR MORE VALVES IN THE HCU IN BYPASS MODE TO ALLOW WHEEL ROTATION, THUS PREVENTING A SKID AND WHEEL LOCK UP.  THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS, THE VALVE(S) IN THE HCU CAN STAY PARTIALLY OPEN (DUE TO AGE, DEBRIS, OLD FLUID, LACK OF ABS EVENTS) AND NOW YOU WILL HAVE DEGRADED BRAKE PERFORMANCE.  THE DEALER WILL BE GLAD TO SELL YOU A NEW HCU AT A COST OF $800 TO $1000.  [XXX].  IF THE HCU IS THAT FINICKY, THEN IT SHOULD BE THE SUBJECT OF A RECALL AND FORD SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PARTS AND LABOR.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  I HAVE RESTORED THE HCU VALVE(S) TO A SEATED POSITION BY RAPIDLY AND FORCEFULLY TAPPING ON EACH VALVE OUTLET/INLET WITH THE HANDLE OF AN ADJUSTABLE WRENCH WITH THE ENGINE RUNNING.  ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, PEDAL TRAVEL LESSENED, AND WHAT APPEARS TO BE NORMAL BRAKING WITH POWER ASSIST RETURNED.  GET ON FORD'S ASS AND HOLD THEIR FEET TO THE FIRE ON THIS BRAKING ISSUE, LIVES ARE AT RISK HERE!
