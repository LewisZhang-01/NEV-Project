THE ENGINE LIGHT FIRST ILLUMINATED WHEN THE ENGINE STOPPED, THEN ALL OF THE PANEL LIGHTS LIT UP. I HAD IT TOWED 25 MILES TO A MECHANIC I TRUST. WHEN HE ASSESSED THE CAR HE LET ME KNOW THE HORRIBLE NEWS THAT THE ENGINE HAD LOCKED UP, AND HE COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY TELL ME WHY. AS OF THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT I HAD OWNED IT FOR EXACTLY 5 YEARS AND 3 DAYS. IT HAS APPROXIMATELY 76,000 MILES AND HAD REGULAR MAINTENANCE.",
