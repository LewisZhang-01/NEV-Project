HOWEVER, WITHOUT WARNING NOR FORESEEABLE CAUSE TO THIS ISSUE. WHEN THE WARNING LIGHT CAME ON, I HAD LITTLE CONTROL OVER THE STEERING. UPON RESEARCH THERE ARE ALREADY VARIOUS COMPLAINTS WITH THE SAME VEHICLE ALL OF WHICH HAS HAPPENED EITHER THE CAR IN MOTION OR MERELY PARKED. THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THIS KNOWN ISSUE THAT THE MANUFACTURER HAS PROVEN THROUGH VARIOUS  SOURCES IS UNETHICAL.  I AM FILING THIS COMPLAINT BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBLE MONETARY LOSS TO MYSELF, AND HIGH RISK NATURE OF THIS ISSUE THAT COULD CAUSE POSSIBLE INJURY.",
