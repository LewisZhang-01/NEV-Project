        "summary": "OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS I HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERAL INSTANCES OF PARTIAL FRONT BRAKE APPLICATION WHEN NO DRIVER INPUT IS INITIATED.  THIS RESULTS IN THE FEELING OF THE CAR DRAGGING.  IT IS SUBTLE BUT IF THE CAR IS PUT INTO NEUTRAL THE CAR COMES TO A STOP EVEN WITH NO DRIVER BRAKE INPUT.  IN SEVERAL INSTANCES THE FRONT BRAKES GET EXTREMELY HOT AND BEGIN TO SMOKE.  THIS IS A SERIOUS FIRE HAZARD.  AFTER ALLOWING THE BRAKES TO COOL FOR ABOUT AN HOUR THE BRAKES RETURN TO NORMAL AND DRIVING CAN RESUME.  I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR SEVERAL TIMES TO THE CHRYSLER DEALER AND OTHER MECHANICS.  THEY CAN FIND NOTHING WRONG.  THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ANY RECALLS OR ALERTS CONCERNING THIS PROBLEM.  I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT THIS PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED ABOUT SEVEN OR EIGHT TIMES, THE MOST RECENT ONE ON JULY 8, 2017.  WEATHER DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A FACTOR NOR DOES HIGHWAY OR LOCAL DRIVING.",
