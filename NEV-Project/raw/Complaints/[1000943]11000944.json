THIS ISSUE IS PLASTERED ALL OVER THE INTERNET AS A CONTINUOUS ISSUE WITH THIS CAR.IN FACT, EVEN WHEN I WAS AT THE DEALER THERE WAS ANOTHER FEMALE CUSTOMER WITH THE EXACT SAME ISSUE AND WHOSE CAR WAS DIAGNOSED AS NEEDING A SHIFTER. THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE RECALLED. WHILE IT MAY NOT SEEM THE SAME AS AN AIRBAG, WOMEN AND ALSO MEN CAN BE PLACED IN DANGER AT NIGHT PULLING UP TO GAS STATIONS, GROCERY STORES, ATOM MACHINES LA THEIR OWN DRIVEWAYS AN UNABLE TO GET THEIR CAR OUT CAN LEAVE THEM VULNERABLE TO PREDATORS.IT IS UNBELIEVABLE THAT SUCH A CONSISTENT COMPLAINT WITH THIS CAR HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE MANUFACTURER. THE FREQUENCY ALONE DICTATES THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW THAT SHOULD BE CORRECTED BEFORE SOMEONE IS ROBBED, RAPED OR WORSE BY BEING DISTRACTED WITH THIS KEY, UNABLE TO RELEASE THE KEY AND MOVE TO SAFETY AT NIGHT",
