FIRST WE WERE BACKING OUT OF DRIVEWAY WITH NOTHING AROUND BUT THE VEHICLE IMPLIED BRAKES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. LUCKILY THE VEHICLE THAT CAME BARRELING DOWN OUR ROAD SLOWED DOWN UNTIL THE VEHICLE FINALLY LET THE BRAKE OFF.  THEN 4 MORE TIMES WHEN DRIVING APPLYING BRAKES RANDOMLY!  THIS IS NOT SAFE.  LUCKILY, WE WERE NOT ON THE HIGHWAY.  BRAKES CONTINUE TO APPLY RANDOMLY WITHOUT THE SAFETY SURROUND SENSORS ACTIVATED!  VEHICLE IS AT DEALER TODAY!",
