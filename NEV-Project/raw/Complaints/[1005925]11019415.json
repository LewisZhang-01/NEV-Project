WE TOOK OUR VEHICLE TO HAVE THE REPAIR, DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THE PREVIOUS OWNER HAD THE VEHICLE REPAIRED AND A DUST COVER WAS PUT ON 7/20/16.  WELL THE DUST COVER HAS BROKE AND THE AIR BAG LIGHT IS ON AND HORN IS NOT WORKING.  SERVICE DEPARTMENT SAID IT WASN'T COVERED BECAUSE OF PREVIOUS FIX, MIND YOU THEY SAID DUST COVER AND NOT A NEW PART.  WE CALLED VW AND THEY WILL NOT HONOR THE REPAIR FOR THE DEFECTED PART.  THE PART WAS NEVER REPLACED, JUST A BAND AID PUT ON THE PROBLEM.  VW SAID THEY ONLY HAD TO HONOR THEIR REPAIR FOR 1 YEAR.   HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE WHEN THEY NEVER REALLY REPLACED THE PART?????  THE DUST COVER THEY PREVIOUSLY PUT ON SNAPPED WHEN I WAS TURNING INTO A PARKING SPOT, AIRBAG LIGHT IMMEDIATELY CAME ON.  THE PART COST $348.08 AND $170.00 IN LABOR.",
