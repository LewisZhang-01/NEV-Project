        "summary": "I LOST MY STEERING COMPLETELY AND HAD TO TAKE MY VEHICLE INTO A SHOP. THE RACK AND PINION FOR THE STEERING OF MY VEHICLE HAS GONE OUT COMPLETELY AT ONLY 80,000 MILES. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ISSUE, AS IT COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS CRASH. WHILE STATIONARY OR MOVING SLOWLY, THE WHEEL IS HARDER TO TURN AND MAKES A LOUD SLIDING/GRINDING SOUND. AT HIGHER SPEEDS, THE STEERING WHEEL GETS \"STUCK\" AND IS VERY HARD TO GET OUT OF A CERTAIN POSITION. THIS ISSUE CAUSED ME TO ALMOST HIT ONCOMING TRAFFIC. AS COMMON AS THIS ISSUE IS AT AN AVERAGE OF 52,000 MILES ON THESE EXPLORERS, IT SHOULD BE A RECALL! THE REPAIR IS AT AN ESTIMATED $3,000 TO FIX. NOW I AM OUT OF A VEHICLE UNTIL I CAN COME UP WITH THAT KIND OF FUNDING, WHILE STILL OWING TONS OF MONEY ON IT. NOT ONLY IS THIS A HUGE FINANCIAL NIGHTMARE, BUT IT IS EXTREMELY UNSAFE!",
