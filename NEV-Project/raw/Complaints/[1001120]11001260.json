I REPLACED THIS SOCKET MULTIPLE TIMES WITH THE SAME RESULTS. I HAVE ALSO MADE SURE THAT ALL GROUNDING POINTS WERE CLEAR AND WORKING PROPERLY, WHICH THEY WERE ALL IN PERFECT CONDITION. THE DATE I HAVE PROVIDED IS THE MOST RECENT OCCURRENCE. THIS IS A KNOWN PROBLEM FOR THIS MAKE AND MODEL. IF YOU GO ONTO THE INTERNET AND DO A GOOGLE SEARCH IT COMES UP INSTANTLY WITH COUNTLESS ACCOUNTS OF THE SAME ISSUE. MY SISTER OWNS THE SAME VECHILE BUT IS A 2006 AND SHE HAS BEEN FIGHTING THE SAME ISSUE. THIS ISSUE COULD POSSIBLY CAUSE A VERY SERIOUS ACCIDENT WITH FATAL CONSEQUENCES SHOULD BOTH LIGHTS FAIL AT NIGHT.",
