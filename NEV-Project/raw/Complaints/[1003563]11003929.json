ON SOME OCCASIONS, THE ELECTRICAL ISSUES AND POWER FAILURE IS TRIGGERED BY ENGAGING THE TURN SIGNAL. SEARCHED YOUTUBE AND DISCOVERED THAT DOZENS OF OTHER 2013 MALIBU OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THE EXACT SAME ISSUE. THE SCARY PART OF THIS ISSUE IS THAT THE CAR STALLS OUT COMPLETELY WITHOUT WARNING WHILE DRIVING AT ANY GIVEN SPEED. AND WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE POWER STEERING GOES OUT AS WELL. THIS HAS HAPPENED ABOUT A DOZEN TIMES SINCE ABOUT A MONTH AFTER PURCHASE AUGUST 2016; THE LAST EXPERIENCE WAS ON THIS PAST FRIDAY, JULY 7, 2017.THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS AS I HAVE ALREADY EXPERIENCED TWO NEAR-MISS ACCIDENTS. I'VE READ SEVERAL POSTS OF OTHERS WHO HAVE SPENT MONEY ON DIAGNOSIS AND REPAIRS ONLY TO DISCOVER THAT THE PROBLEM REOCCURS. I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO WASTE ON FRUITLESS REPAIRS AS I'M STILL PAYING A NOTE PLUS FULL COVERAGE INSURANCE ON THIS VEHICLE. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY COMPLAINTS THAT IT WILL TAKE FOR SOMETHING TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS SERIOUS PROBLEM, BUT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE IN A HURRY.",
