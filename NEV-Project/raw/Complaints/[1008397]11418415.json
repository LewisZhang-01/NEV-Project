        "summary": "Car lost all braking within 5 miles of starting truck.  THERE WAS RISK OF SERIOUS INJURY/DEATH.   No issues were experienced before parking the car the day before.    Audible alert and panel \"brake fluid low light\" came only only 2 miles before total brake loss.  Brake reservoir was empty.  Refilled reservoir, pumped brakes until \"normal\" braking was experienced and the refilled brake reservoir.    Ran the engine and drove 3 miles before all braking was lost again.  Checked engine compartment and area surrounding brake reservoir and cylinder plus all hydraulic fittings around all four brakes and found all to be bone dry.  No evidence of any leak anywhere.  Mechanic believes the fluid is being consumed by the engine (bakes sense) and plans on examining to determine.",
