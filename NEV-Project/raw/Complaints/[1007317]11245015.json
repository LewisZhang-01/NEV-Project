I HAD TO STAY IN MY VEHICLE AND MISS AN APPOINTMENT BECAUSE OF THIS. I COULDN'T GET IT TO MOVE FROM DRIVE TO PARK. AFTER SEVERAL TRIES AND 30 MINUTES, IT FINALLY MOVED. IT'S GOTTEN STUCK A FEW TIMES TRYING TO MOVE IT FROM PARK TO DRIVE AS WELL. AND WHEN I'M DRIVING, THE EMERGENCY LIGHTS WILL RANDOMLY ILLUMINATE AND WIPERS WON'T WORK. I WAS DRIVING WHEN IT WAS POURING RAIN AND THE WIPERS WOULDN'T TURN ON WITH ALL EMERGENCY LIGHTS ILLUMINATED AS WELL. THIS CAN HAPPEN ANYTIME I'M ON A CITY STREET GOING FROM 25 TO 45 MPH. I HAVE HAD TO HAVE IT TOWED SEVERAL TIMES TO DIFFERENT SHOPS AND THEY CAN'T TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG.",
