        "summary": "I PURCHASED TRUCK USED JUNE 2016..SOMEBODY INFORMED ME LATER THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RUST ISSUE WITH THE FRAMES ON THESE MODELS. UPON VISUAL INSPECTION IT LOOKS LIKE AT SOME POINT SOMEBODY TRIED TO COVER UP WITH UNDER SPRAY. THAT HAS NOT HELD BECAUSE A GOOD PORTION OF FRAME AND CROSS MEMBER HAS RUSTED AWAY. I CALLED TOYOTA AND THEY GAVE ME TWO CASE NUMBERS AND SAID IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY AND RECALL EXPIRED. I ASKED DEALERSHIP TO INSPECT FOR RUST IN JANUARY OF 2017 AND THEY SAID IT WAS TOYOTA ISSUE AND TO WAIT. I THINK IT COULD BE POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUE IF TRYING TO PULL TRAILER AND POSSIBLE ANY OTHER TIME..SAFETY ISSUES SHOULD NOT HAVE EXPIRATION IN MY OPINION. NOT GOOD FEEDBACK SINCE JANUARY.",
