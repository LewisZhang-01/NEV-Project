        "summary": "WHEN DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS (65 MPH+) WITH CRUISE CONTROL ENABLED, IF I PASS AN 18 WHEELER, THE CAR WILL SUDDENLY JAM ON THE BRAKES AND DECELERATE FROM MY CURRENT SPEED DOWN BELOW 55 MPH. THIS HAPPENS IN LESS THEN 3 SECONDS. THERE IS NO ONE IN FRONT OF ME - IT IS A CLEAR STRAIGHTAWAY.  IF I STEP ON THE GAS THE CAR WILL SPEED UP AND I'LL PASS THE TRUCK. AT THAT POINT THE CRUISE CONTROL WILL OPERATE NORMALLY - UNTIL I PASS ANOTHER TRUCK. THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN ALL THEN TIME. MAYBE 20%. IT SEEMS TO HAPPEN WITH TALL TRACTOR TRAILERS MORE THEN NORMAL TRUCKS. ASIDE FROM THE SUDDEN STOPPING ISSUE, THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT CARS BEHIND ME SEE THAT I AM STOPPING FOR NO APPARENT REASON AND IF THEY'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION THEY'LL RUN RIGHT INTO THE BACK OF MY CAR. THIS HAS BEEN A DAY 1 PROBLEM - I BOUGHT THE CAR NEW IN 2014. I AM ADDING MY COMPLAINT TO OTHERS WHO HAVE REPORTED THIS SAME ISSUE. FORDS RESPONSE - PAY $3000 TO HAVE YOUR CAR FIXED. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND THERE OUGHT TO BE A RECALL TO GET IT FIXED.",
