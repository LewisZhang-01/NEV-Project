Now I find out that the front end is shot as well and that Mazda is only recalling the front subframe and not the rear and I want to know why. Somebody could have been killed. The repair cost me $700 plus rental fees for a vehicle. I had my vehicle in the shop for 16days. It cost me $1,135. I have the invoices.",
