AFTER USING IT A COUPLE TIMES TO MOVE VEHICLES AROUND, THE REAR AXLE CAME OFF WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE 210 FREEWAY HERE IN CALIFORNIA, LUCKILY IT WAS EMPTY. AFTER FURTHER INSPECTION, ALL THE U-BOLTS HOLDING THE AXLES TO THE LEAF SPRINGS WERE NOT TIGHT. ALL FOUR WERE HAND TIGHT. THIS COULD OF CAUSED AN ACCIDENT AND POSSIBLY KILLED MYSELF OR SOMEONE ELSE. ANY AXLE THAT COMES OFF COULD CAUSE THE LOSS OF CONTROL OF THE TOW VEHICLE AND THE TRAILER.",
