I HAD JUST SHIFTED THE MOTORCYCLE IN TO 3RD GEAR WHEN IT LOST ALL POWER AND STARTED SLOWING DOWN. THE NEXT EXIT WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO REACH SAFELY AND MY ONLY OPTION WAS TO COAST INTO THE SIDE EMERGENCY LANE. AS I WAS INVESTIGATING THE ISSUE A SMALL PLASTIC PULLEY FORM THE LEFT SIDE THROTTLE-BODY FELL TO THE GROUND. I'M CURRENTLY CONTACTING BMW MOTORCYCLES AS THIS WAS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE THAT PUT ME IN HARMS WAY.  THIS PLASTIC PIECE IS UNDER CONSTANT TENSION AND  IN MY OPINION SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN MAKE OF PLASTIC.",
