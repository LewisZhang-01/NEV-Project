        "summary": "ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO MY CAR STALLED AFTER BEING PARKED AT A MAJOR HIGHWAY RED LIGHT. I WAS LUCKILY ABLE TO PULL OFF THE ROAD SAFELY. THE WRENCH WARNING LIGHT CAME ON (POWER TRAIN ISSUE) BUT AFTER SHUTTING OFF & RESTARTING THE CAR WORKED FINE. I HAD IT SERVICED AFTER & IT DIDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN UNTIL LAST FRIDAY,6/16/17. AGAIN AFTER BEING STOPPED AT A LIGHT ON A MAJOR ROAD & CAUSING ME TO PULL OFF THE ROAD. IT HAS NOW HAPPENED 6 TIMES IN A WEEK. ALWAYS AFTER A STOP SIGN/LIGHT. EVERY TIME IT SEEMS TO LOSE ENGINE POWER, THE WRENCH LIGHT COMES ON AND THE CAR SLOWS TO A SCARY SLOW SPEED. AFTER TURNING THE CAR OFF, THE LIGHT GOES AWAY AND THE CAR COMES BACK ON. AFTER RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM ONLINE WE THOUGHT IT WAS THE THROTTLE BODY LIKE OTHERS HAVE HAD. ON 6/20/17 WE TOOK IT TO THE SHOP AND GOT THE CODE P2111 (THROTTLE ACTUATOR CONTROL SYSTEM - STUCK OPEN). THEY CLEANED THE PART, THE CODE WENT AWAY AND IT'S BEEN STALL FREE UNTIL TODAY, 6/23/17. I DIDN'T MAKE IT A STREET OVER FROM MY HOUSE BEFORE IT HAPPENED AGAIN AT A 4-WAY STOP. I IMMEDIATELY CAME BACK HOME AND THE CAR WILL SIT IN MY DRIVEWAY UNTIL I TAKE IT TO HAVE THE PART REPLACED. AFTER READING SO MANY ACCOUNTS OF THIS HAPPENING AND CERTAIN MODELS GETTING RECALLED OR \"CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PLANS\" I DON'T GET HOW FORD HASN'T HAD TO REPLACE THEM ALL. IT IS DANGEROUS! I AM FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO NOT HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT EACH TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED, BUT I AM LITERALLY SCARED TO DEATH TO DRIVE MY CAR. IF I DO I SPEND THE ENTIRE TIME TENSE & DRIVING SLOW IN THE RIGHT LANE IN CASE IT STALLS & I HAVE TO PULL OVER. FORD SHOULD NOT GET AWAY WITH HAVING SCARED DRIVERS ON THE ROAD WHEN THIS IS CLEARLY AN ISSUE WITH THEIR VEHICLES. MY CAR IS 4 YEARS OLD AND I TAKE CARE OF IT. I SHOULD NOT BE SCARED TO LEAVE MY HOUSE IN IT. NOR DO I THINK I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY THE $100+ IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO REPLACE A PART THEY KNOW TO BE FAULTY.",
