WE HAVE TWO VIDEO ONE JUST AFTER THE WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON AND THE SECOND AFTER WE STOP, SHUT THE ENGINE OFF AND RESTARTED TAKEN TODAY JULY 9 2017 AT 4:56PM. THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING SINCE THE CAR WAS PURCHASE IN JULY 2014. WE HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE INTO ULTIMATE SUBARU OF FREDERICKSBURG, VA AND TO CREWS SUBARU NORTH CHARLESTON SC ABOUT THIS PROBLEM ON JULY 6 2017. I WAS INFORMED THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO SINCE THE LIGHT DOESN'T STAY ON. THEY ALSO COULDN'T TELL ME IF THE CAR WAS SAFE TO DRIVE WITH SOMEONE RIDING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT WITH THE WARNING LIGHTS ON.   THE TECHS AT CREW SUBARU NORTH CHARLESTON SC TOLD ME TO MAKE A VIDEO AND TO SEND IT TO SUBARU CORPORATE, NHTSA AND IIHS. MY RESEARCH ONLINE SHOWS THAT SUBARU HAD A RECALL ON THEIR 2012 IMPREZA RECALL #WQT-55, . THE FIX WAS TO REPLACE THE SEAT SENOR. SINCE WE HAVE CONTACTED TWO DEALERS ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE. WE HAVE REPORTED THIS TO INSURANCE INSTITUTE FOR HIGHWAY SAFETY (IIHS) ON APRIL 20, 2017. TODAY I CONTACTED SUBARU CORPORATE CASE # 1-24758084454 I SPOKE WITH KIYA AT CUSTOMER SERVICE THIS MORNING JULY 10, 2017 SHE IS THE ONE PERSON WHOM STATED THAT IF THE WARNING LIGHTS ARE ON THEN THE AIR BAGS WOULD NOT WORK. I HAVE VIDEO SHOW THIS BUT CAN NOT UPLOAD IT TO THIS SITE. I CAN EMAIL IT TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE.",
