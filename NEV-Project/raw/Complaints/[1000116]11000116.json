SEEMS LIKE AIRBAG WON'T DEPLOY WHILE LIGHT IS ON , AND IF THERE IS AN ACCIDENT AND LIGHT IS ON I THINK THE DRIVER AIRBAG WILL NOT DEPLOY .  HYUNDAI DEALERS ALREADY KNOW THE ISSUE AND APPARENTLY IS A BAD ELECTRIC CONNECTION ON THE SEAT BELT CLICK THAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACE ... THEY ARE WILLING TO \"DIAGNOSE IT\" FOR $125  .. BUT MANY PEOPLE SAYS THE COST OF REPAIR IS $490 . THEY WONT ACKNOWLEDGE IS A DEFECT ON THE WIRING AND WANT PEOPLE TO PAY FOR IT .IS  VERY SCARY DRIVING KNOWING THAT MY AIRBAG MAY NOT DEPLOY",
