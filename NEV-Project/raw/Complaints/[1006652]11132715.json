        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 20 MPH AFTER ACCELERATING FROM A STOP AND THE TRANSMISSION SHIFTED OUT OF DRIVE. I COULD HEAR IT CLUNK AND FEEL THE CAR JERK. I STOPPED AND DOWNSHIFTED BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. I PUT IT IN PARK, TURNED OFF THE ENGINE. I RESTARTED IT, SHIFTED TO DRIVE AND SLOWLY ACCELERATED. I GOT ABOUT 20 YARDS AND IT SLIPPED OUT OF GEAR AGAIN. IT WOULDN'T SHIFT INTO ANY GEAR EXCEPT PARK. THIS WAS AFTER DRIVING ABOUT 100 MILES. I HAD NO ISSUES PRIOR TO THIS. NO WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON UNTIL ALL OF THIS HAPPENED AND AS I PULLED INTO MY DRIVEWAY A WARNING CAME ON SAYING \"TRANSMISSION FAULT SEE SERVICE STATION\". IT HAS 124,000 MILES ON IT. I'VE HAD IT FOR JUST UNDER 2 YEARS, BOUGHT USED, AND HAVEN'T HAD ANY ISSUES WITH THE TRANSMISSION BEFORE NOW. I RESEARCHED INFO ONLINE AND IT LOOKS LIKE THIS IS NOT AN ISOLATED PROBLEM, BUT FORD IS NOT RECOGNIZING THIS AS AN ISSUE. TRANSMISSIONS SHOULD NOT JUST BREAK DOWN FOR NO REASON, AND IF THEY DO, FORD SHOULD FIX THE PROBLEM.",
