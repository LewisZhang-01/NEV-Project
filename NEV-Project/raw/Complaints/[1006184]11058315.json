        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING  MY 2008 RAV 4 AND I MADE A TURN & ALL OF A SUDDEN MY STEERING WHEEL LITERALLY BECAME FREE FLOATING. I CAN MOVE THE STEERING WHEEL 8 TO 12 INCHES UP AND DOWN WITH NO RESISTANCE. I CAN ALSO MOVE IT 6 TO 8 INCHES LEFT TO RIGHT WITH NO RESISTANCE. IT'S NOT GUIDED IN ANY WAY, YOU CAN MOVE IT AROUND IN A LARGE CIRCULAR MOTION.   I WAS ABLE TO STILL STEER SOMEWHAT. THE COLUMN STILL SEEMS TO BE ATTACHED TO SOMETHING.     WHEN YOU DO STEER, IT MAKES A HORRIBLE POPPING SOUND.  THE DEALERSHIP SAID: A FRAME WELD DID GIVE OUT FOR THE STEERING COLUMN ASSEMBLY. THE STEERING COLUMN ASSEMBLY IS EVERYTHING BETWEEN THE WHEEL AND THE INTERMEDIATE SHAFT. THE STEERING ASSEMBLY IS MOUNTED TO THE INSTRUMENT PANEL REINFORCEMENT BAR. THIS IS A LARGE BAR THAT RUNS THE LENGTH OF YOUR DASHBOARD. THIS BAR HAS A FEW WELDED MOUNTS ON IT THAT ALLOW YOU TO BOLT THE STEERING COLUMN ASSEMBLY INTO, IT IS THESE WELDS WHICH FAILED.   THE AIR DUCT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE FELL ONTO MY FEET/PEDALS WHILE I WAS DRIVING. LUCKILY IT DIDNT GET CAUGHT BEHIND MY PEDALS.   I SOFT DRIVE APPROX 8000-9000 MILES A YEAR. I'VE HAD NO ACCIDENTS.   TOYOTA IS CHARGING ME $2200 TO REPLACE THIS & WILL NOT COER THE COSTS. THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE & I DID RESERCH & THIS HAS HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES!
