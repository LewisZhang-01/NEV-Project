THIS PROBLEM IS VERY COMMON ON ALL PRE 2014 CONVERTIBLES.  THE MECHANISM WAS CHANGED IN 2014 TO AVOID THIS DEFECT BUT EARLIER MODELS WERE NOT RECALLED FOR REPAIR/REPLACEMENT LEAVING OWNERS WITH A VERY EXPENSIVE ($16,000) REPAIR.  THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECALL ALL MODELS AT RISK AND REPLACE DEFECTIVE TOPS WITH CURRENT MECHANISM.",
