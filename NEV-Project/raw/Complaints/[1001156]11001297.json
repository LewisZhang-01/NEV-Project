IT REGAINED ACCELERATION THEN WENT AWAY AGAIN WITH A HARSH SOUND. I WAS ABLE TO SAFELY MOVE OVER TO THE SHOULDER AND INSPECTED THE VEHICLE. IT WOULD NOT MOVE IN ANY GEAR AND UPON INSPECTION OF THE UNDERSIDE, SMOKE/STEAM WAS COMING FROM THE DIFFERENTIAL AND IT WAS VERY HOT TO THE TOUCH. THE TOWING COMPANY SPENT AN HOUR TRYING TO PULL IT ONTO THE FLATBED DUE TO BOTH REAR WHEELS BEING LOCKED DESPITE ALL BRAKES BEING OFF AND THE TRANSMISSION BEING IN NEUTRAL. ONCE IT WAS DROPPED OFF AT MY RESIDENCE, I REMOVED THE THIRD MEMBER ASSEMBLY. I DISCOVERED THERE WAS NO FLUID AND THE PINION GEAR LOOKED GROUND DOWN AND THERE WERE METAL FLAKES. IT ALSO APPEARED TO BE LEAKING FROM THE PINION SEAL, SOMETHING I WAS NOT AWARE OF LEADING UP TO THE INCIDENT.",
