A MESSAGE APPEARED \"STEERING ASSIST FAULT - SERVICE REQUIRED\"... NO WARNING, THIS MESSAGED JUST POPPED UP AT TIME OF FAILURE.  MY DAUGHTER STRUGGLED TO GET THE CAR OFF THE ROAD AND CALLED ME - REFUSING TO DRIVE THE CAR FOR FEAR OF ENDANGERING HER OR HER DAUGHTER.  I HAD TO COME GET HER.... I DROVE THE CAR HOME - ALLTHOUGH THERE HAS NOT BEEN A PROBLEM WITH THE CAR IN THE 2 TIMES I HAVE DRIVEN IT.  MY DAUGHTER WILL NOT DRIVE IT AGAIN.  I HAVE READ THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HUNDRED OTHERS REPORTING THIS SAME PROBLEM - INCLUDING A REPORT IN THE NY TIMES.  DOES SOMEBODY TO DIE BEFORE THERE IS A RECALL?  THE CAR HAS 75,000 MILES ON IT.",
