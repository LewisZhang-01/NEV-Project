        "summary": "ON SEPTEMBER 8, 2016, I WAS DRIVING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THE CAR'S STEERING VIOLENTLY PULLED TO THE RIGHT AND WHEN I TRIED TO CORRECT IT, THE CAR THEN TURNED ALL OF THE WAY TO THE LEFT, CAUSING THE CAR TO ROLL OVER SEVERAL TIMES.  ALTHOUGH I HAD MY SEAT BELT ON, THE PRE-TENSIONERS DIDN'T FIRE TO KEEP ME FROM MOVING AROUND AND HITTING MY HEAD.    NONE OF THE AIRBAGS WENT OFF EITHER, NOT EVEN THE ONES ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE CURTAIN WHERE THE CAR WAS DAMAGED.      AFTERWARDS, I WENT TO THE DOCTOR AND A CHIROPRACTOR BECAUSE I HURT MY BACK, NECK AND MY HEAD.  I ALSO GOT A LAWYER BECAUSE I HAD NOT DONE ANYTHING WRONG WHILE DRIVING.  THE STEERING PROBLEM JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.    NISSAN, TAKATA, TKH AND MY LAWYER INSPECTED THE CAR IN MARCH AND FOUND THAT NONE OF THE AIR BAGS WENT OFF, THE SEAT BELT PRE-TENSIONERS DIDN'T ACTIVATE, THE CAR'S VEHICLE SPEED SENSOR HAD A FAULT CODE, THE CAR'S INTAKE AIR TEMPERATURE SENSOR HAD A FAULT CODE AND NISSAN'S ENGINEER THAT WAS THERE WAS UNABLE TO ACCESS THE POWER STEERING MODULE WITH HIS MACHINE.      NEXT, WE FOUND OUT THAT THE ELECTRONIC POWER STEERING SYSTEM CAN SHUT DOWN DUE TO EXCESSIVE STEERING AT SLOW SPEEDS.  THAT IS BAD BECAUSE NISSAN HAD A TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETIN THAT SAID THAT THE CAR CAN PULL TO ONE SIDE EVEN WHEN ALIGNED BASED ON NISSAN'S REQUIREMENTS.  THIS MEANS THAT THE REASON PEOPLE HAVE HAD STEERING PROBLEMS IS BECAUSE OF THE CAR'S DESIGN, NISSAN'S ALIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS AND THE CAR NEEDING TO BE ALIGNED DIFFERENTLY.  ALSO THE INTAKE AIR TEMPERATURE SENSOR CAN CAUSE A CAR TO SURGE AND SPUTTER, THIS CAN BE WHY PEOPLE HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH ACCELERATION.  THERE IS NO REASON WHY THE SEAT BELT PRETENSIONERS DIDN'T PROTECT ME.  I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE SPEEDOMETER RECALL MAY BE DUE TO THE VEHICLE SPEED SENSOR PROBLEM.    MY CAR WAS TOTALED AND THESE THINGS NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED.",
