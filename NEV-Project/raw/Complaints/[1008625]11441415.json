Yesterday, Monday, November 22, 2021, the vehicle stopped while driving on the street and it required a jump to get it started again.  It has been very slow when starting back when at the red/green light. Very sluggish to slow motion to get speed. The system was showing low oil percentage at 53% but oil was changed three months ago and is not due for change until January, 2022 at 47281 miles.  Current mileage is 45740/50. Took car back to Art Moran last Friday to have system reset since it had not been done at the time of oil change.  Please respond ASAP.  My father is 80+ and he was very frightened when the car stopped on him.",
