MY OIL INDICATOR SAID THE OIL WAS FINE, BUT HE SAID THE OIL WAS VERY LOW. HE TOLD ME TO CHECK THE OIL EVERY THREE TO FOUR WEEKS. HE ALSO GAVE ME TWO EXTRA QUARTS OF OIL. I HAVE NOTICED THAT MY CAR NEEDS AN OIL CHANGE QUITE OFTEN. WHEN I WAS DRIVING MY CAR, THE CAR WAS RATTLING AND WAS LURCHING FOWARD AT A STOP LIGHT,  I THOUGHT IT WAS THE TRANSMISSION, BUT IT IS THE OIL BEING CONSUMED AT A HIGHER RATE THAN NORMAL.",
