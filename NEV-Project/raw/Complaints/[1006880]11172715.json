IN LATE DECEMBER 2018 HIT A BUMP ON A HIGHWAY DRIVING THE POSTED SPEED OF 70MPH AND THE VEHICLE VIBRATED A BIT AND HAD TO SLOW DOWN TO HANDLE THE VEHICLE.  EACH WEEK AFTER DRIVING THE VEHICLE ON DAILY COMMUTE IN CITY CONDITIONS AT THE POSTED SPEED OF 25-30MPH, AFTER HITTING A BUMP IN THE PAVEMENT THE VEHICLE DOES NOT HANDLE WELL, AS IF I WOULD LOSE CONTROL.  ON JANUARY 27, 2019 DRIVING ON A RAMP AT THE SPEED OF 45MPH UPON ENTERING THE INTERSTATE THE VEHICLE HIT A BUMP IN THE PAVEMENT, THE VEHICLE BEGINS AN UNCONTROLLABLE VIBRATION AND WAS SHAKING THE STEERING WHEEL, I HAD TO PULL OVER.  AFTER RESEARCHING THIS ISSUE ONLINE WITH THE SAME ISSUE, I FEEL UNSAFE DRIVING MY ONLY VEHICLE.  FOR A VEHICLE VALUED OVER $45,000, I NEED THIS ISSUE TO BE INVESTIGATED BEFORE SOMEONE IS SERIOUSLY INJURED.  I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE AT THE POSTED SPEED.  THE VEHICLE FEELS UNSTABLE WHILE DRIVING OVER ANY BUMP IN THE PAVEMENT AT 20MPH THE VEHICLE WOBBLES AND SWAYS.",
