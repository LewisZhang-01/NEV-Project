Took vehicle into Larry H. Miller Toyota Dealership and they told me it was the ECM (wasn't communicating properly with the LAN system) and that the heated seats were affected as well.  This is as 2018 with only 30k miles on it and says it's not covered under warranty and I will have to pay $1,500 out of pocket. This was a Manufacturer defect, why is the consumer having to pay for a manufacturers defect?",
