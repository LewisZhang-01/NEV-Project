I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY DEALERSHIP THAT THE PART IS NOT AVAILABLE NOW AND THEY CANNOT GIVE A TIME WHEN IT WILL BE AVAILABLE.  TAKATA HAS NOW FILED BANKRUPTCY.  MY COMPLAINT IS THAT I DID NOT BUY THE CAR FROM TAKATA, I BOUGHT IT FROM A LINCOLN DEALERSHIP.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY LINCOLN CAN'T GET ANOTHER AIRBAG FOR REPLACEMENT.  IT IS NOW OCTOBER 20,2017.  THEY HAVE HAD ENOUGH TIME FOR THIS RECALL.  I AM FEARFUL OF A PASSENGER RIDING IN THE CAR IF THE DEFECTIVE AIRBAG SHOULD ERUPT AND KILL OR INJURE SOMEONE.  I CAN'T SELL THE CAR.  WHO'S GOING TO BUY A CAR WITH A RECALL FOR A TAKATA AIRBAG?",
