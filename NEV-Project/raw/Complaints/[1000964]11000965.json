THE  CRACK IN THE FRAME CAUSED THE FUEL PORTS TO BE OFF-LINE AS WELL AS THE BIKE TO BE IN OPERABLE AND UNSAFE TO MYSELF OR OTHERS ON THE RROAD. WHEN I CHECKED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF A FRAME FROM KAWASAKI,  WHEN I CONTACTED KAWASAKI THEY SAID THAT THE PART IS BACKORDERED, I BELIEVE THIS IS A AN ATTEMPT NOT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MANUFACTURE DEFECT. I NOW HAVE A PERFECTLY AWESOME BIKE THAT'S IN OPERABLE AND UNSAFE, I AM SURE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF OTHER KAWASAKI OWNERS  WHO HAVE SUFFERED THE SAME FATE A PERFECTLY GOOD BIKE THAT DOES NOT WORK NOW BECAUSE OF OF MANUFACTURE DEFECT.",
