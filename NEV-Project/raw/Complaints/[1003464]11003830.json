THE SHUDDER CAUSES SLOPPY ACCELERATION DELAYS FROM ZERO STARTS, LIGHTS AND STOP SIGNS, JUST LIKE A MANUAL SHIFT BEING DRIVEN BY A DRIVER UNSKILLED CLUTCH/SHIFT COORDINATION.  THE SAME THING OCCURS WHEN BRAKING FOR A LIGHT, THEN AT LOW SPEED, THE LIGHT TURNS GREEN AND YOU CHANGE TO ACCELERATING INSTEAD OF COMPLETELY BECOMING STATIONARY.",
