        "summary": "I PURCHASED MY FORD ESCAPE CERTIFIED USED FROM A DEALERSHIP BACK IN JULY 2016, IT HAD APPROXIMATELY 26,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE AND NO ACCIDENTS REPORTED. IN FEBRUARY 2017 THE VEHICLE STARTS HESITATING WHILE IN MOTION ON A COUNTRY STREET, ACTING AS THOUGH IT WAS ABOUT TO STALL OUT, NO WARNING INDICATORS CAME UP, ABLE TO GET TO OUR DRIVEWAY. WHEN IN OUR DRIVEWAY WE WERE ABLE TO BACK UP BUT WHEN PLACED IN DRIVE THE DASH GAVE A WARNING THAT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT IN PARK AND IT WOULD NOT MOVE FORWARD ONLY IN REVERSE. WE GOT IT TOWED BY OUR FORD WARRANTY TO A LOCAL DEALERSHIP WHERE PAPERWORK LOOKS LIKE THEY DID AN OVERHAUL ON THE TRANSMISSION. NOW IT JULY OF 2017 (56,000 MILES ON IT) WHILE DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY THE CAR BEGINS TO HESITATE AGAIN, I WAS ABLE TO GET OFF AN EXIT ON THE HIGHWAY BUT THEN MY CAR COMPLETELY STOPPED. WHEN THE ACCELERATOR WAS PRESSED NOTHING HAPPENED. NO WARNING INDICATORS AT ALL PRESENT ON DASH. I TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE AND TURN IT BACK ON AND THE CAR WAS ABLE TO MOVE AN INCH. WHEN PLACED IN THE SPORT DRIVE THE CAR COULD NOT RECOGNIZE IT IN DRIVE AS EVIDENCED BY IT DID NOT EVEN LIGHT UP THE \"S\" ON THE DASH TO LET YOU KNOW IT WAS IN SPORT DRIVE. FORD AGAIN TOWED MY CAR TO THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP WHERE IT IS BEING INSPECTED AS WE SPEAK. I HAVE HAD THE CAR A TOTAL OF 1 YEAR AND IT HAS BEEN AT THE DEALERSHIP TWICE FOR TRANSMISSION ISSUES. UNACCEPTABLE, THANK GOODNESS BOTH TIMES I WAS ABLE TO GET THE VEHICLE TO SAFETY, I WOULD NOT WANT TO IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I WAS ON A MUCH LARGER HIGHWAY AND THIS OCCURRED TO THE VEHICLE. THESE ISSUES ARE MAKING ME FEEL VERY UNSAFE AND UNCOMFORTABLE DRIVING THE VEHICLE, ESPECIALLY WHEN MY TWO CHILDREN ARE IN THE CAR WITH ME.",
