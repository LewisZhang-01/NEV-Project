CHANGED OUT THE RACK AND PINION AND THE POWER STEERING PUMP AND THE PROBLEM IS STILL OCCURRING. IT OCCURS MOSTLY AT LOW SPEEDS, BUT ALSO OCCURS AT HIGHER SPEEDS. THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A HUGE ISSUE BECAUSE THERE ARE MULTIPLE REPORTS ONLINE OF OTHER PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE. WE OBVIOUSLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO STEER TO DRIVE AND ALSO QUICKLY AVOID ANY HAZARDS ON THE ROAD AND WE CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.",
