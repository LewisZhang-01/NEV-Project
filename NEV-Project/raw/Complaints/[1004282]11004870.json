I PUT MY FOOT ON THE GAS AND PRESS ALL THE WAY DOWN WHERE IT SLOWLY MOVES, PICK UP A SPEED AND DO THE SAME THING FOR EACH STOP SIGN OR TRAFFIC STOP LIGHT.  WHEN STARTING THE VEHICLE, IT MAKES A SCREECHING SOUND.  IF ABLE TO DRIVE, STEERING WHEEL SOMETIMES HAVE THAT SLIGHT SHAKING.  WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING THESE ISSUES FOR MORE THAN A YEAR NOW.  TIRES WERE CHANGED AND BRAKES CHANGED BUT ISSUES STILL A BIG CONCERN.",
