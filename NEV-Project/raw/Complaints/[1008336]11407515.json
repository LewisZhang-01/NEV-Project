TO KEEP IT RUNNING I HAVE TO PUT IN NEUTRAL AND PRESS THE GAS PEDAL TO KEEP IT RUNNING AND THEN PUT INTO GEAR AND TAKE OFF. THIS IS NOT SAFE. IT IS THE 2.7L ECOBOOST. I TOOK IT TO OUR LOCAL FORD WHERE IT HAPPENED TO THE TECH THAT TOOK MY TRUCK IN FOR INSPECTION AND THEN THEY SAID THE SERVICE TECH COULD NOT REPLICATE THE ISSUE. THEY CHARGED ME $130 DIAGNOSIS FEE AND SAID THEY COULDN'T FIND THE ISSUE AND CALLED FOR ME TO PICK UP MY VEHICLE. THIS IS HAPPENING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE.",
