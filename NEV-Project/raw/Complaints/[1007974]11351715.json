MY ENGINE SHUTS OFF, I LOSE POWER STEERING, AND I LOSE MY BREAK ASSIST. IT IS VERY SCARY AND DANGEROUS AND COULD CAUSE A LIFE THREATENING ACCIDENT. I CROSSED OVER INTO THE OPPOSITE LANE OF TRAFFIC WITH LITTLE TO NO CONTROL. FORTUNATELY BOTH TIMES NO ONE WAS NEAR ME AND I WAS ABLE TO COME TO A STOP. I CAN THEN RESTART THE CAR AND DRIVE AWAY. I DONT KNOW HOW TO REPLICATE THE ISSUE. I HAVE SEEN OTHER REPORTS OF THIS SAME PROBLEM WITH OTHER GRAND CHEROKEES ON THE INTERNET. I DONT KNOW IF THE CURRENT RECALL THAT I NEED IS SUPPOSED TO ADDRESS IT OR NOT BUT I PLAN ON CALLING MY DEALER ABOUT IT ASAP. MY CAR IS ABOUT 149K MILES. I THINK THE LIGHTS STAY ON WHEN THIS HAPPENS.",
