        "summary": "THE POSITIVE TERMINAL OF THE PASSENGER-SIDE BATTERY CABLE ASSEMBLY MELTED.  NOT CORRODED'IT MELTED.  THE TERMINAL WAS LIKE GREY MARSHMALLOW.  ALL REQUIRED AND RECOMMENDED TRUCK SERVICE HAS BEEN PERFORMED ON TIME AND BY THE FORD DEALERSHIP AND NO ANOMALIES WITH THE BATTERY OR ELECTRICAL SYSTEM WERE EVER NOTED BY THE DEALERSHIP.  TRUCK IS LESS THAN 36 MONTHS OLD AND THE BATTERIES WERE ORIGINAL AND OEM AND LESS THAN THEIR 36 MONTH GUARANTEED LIFE. NO DAMAGE EVIDENT TO THE BATTERY.      THIS IS DANGEROUS AND COULD OF POTENTIALLY STARTED A VEHICLE FIRE.  EVEN MORE INTERESTING IS THIS CABLE ASSEMBLY IS ON AN EMERGENCY BACK-ORDER.  THE PART IS 'HC3Z 14300 A :CABLE ASSEMBLY - BATTERY TO BATTERY' AND FORD QUOTES $2,500 - $3,000 TO FIX IT (PARTS AND LABOR) AND THEY CLAIM IT FAILED DUE TO NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR WHICH IS PREPOSTEROUS.    THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND THE NHTSA NEEDS TO BE AWARE OF IT.  THIS COULD OF LEAD TO A DEADLY VEHICLE FIRE.  AGAIN, THIS WAS NOT CORROSION OF THE TERMINAL, THIS WAS THE TERMINAL MELTING.    I STILL HAVE THE BATTERIES THAT THIS SITUATION OCCURRED WITH ALTHOUGH NEW BATTERIES HAVE NOW BEEN INSTALLED IN THE VEHICLE.",
