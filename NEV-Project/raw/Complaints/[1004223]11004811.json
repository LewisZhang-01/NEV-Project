        "summary": "BRAKE BOOSTER FAILED AT 65,375 MILES.  FORD HAS ISSUED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON BRAKE BOOSTERS, INCLUDING 2013 MODELS, HOWEVER I WAS TOLD MY CAR WAS MANUFACTURED A COUPLE OF MONTHS AFTER THE MANUFACTURE DATES OF CARS INCLUDED IN THE WARRANTY - SO THERE WAS NO WARRANTY COVERAGE FOR THIS $891.82 REPAIR.  THE BRAKE RESPONSE ON MY CAR WOULD INTERMITTENTLY BECOME VERY STIFF (HARD TO DEPRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL) AND DIFFICULT TO BRAKE.  THIS OCCURRED IN VARIOUS PLACES -  INCLUDING STOPPING AT A STOP SIGN BEFORE TURNING ONTO A VERY BUSY STREET, AND AT INTERSECTIONS.   A LITTLE HISSING NOISE COULD BE HEARD WHILE BRAKING, AS WELL.  THIS UNPREDICTABLE RESISTANCE TO BRAKING EFFORTS CREATED A DANGEROUS DRIVING CONDITION.  I HAVE READ MANY ACCOUNTS OF OTHER DRIVERS WHOSE BRAKES ALSO DEPRESSED COMPLETELY, WITHOUT SATISFACTORY BRAKING, DUE TO THIS DEFECTIVE BRAKE BOOSTER.  I WAS TOLD THAT THE BOOSTER INSTALLED ON MY CAR WAS NOT DEFECTIVE, BUT I AM CONVINCED IT WAS, AS WELL AS THE OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.  I FEEL STRONGLY THAT THIS SHOULD BE A FORD RECALL ISSUE, RATHER THAN BEING ADDRESSED AS A WARRANTY ITEM, DUE TO THE DANGER OF OPERATING A VEHICLE WITH A DEFECTIVE BRAKING SYSTEM (DUE TO FAULTY BRAKE BOOSTER DESIGN), AND I BELIEVE MY CAR WAS BUILT WITH A FAULTY BRAKE BOOSTER.  I WAS TOLD MY CAR WAS BUILT WITH A FORD MOTORCRAFT BRAKE BOOSTER (MOTORCRAFT PART #2005(BRB-47, FORD PART #BA1Z2005A).  THE REPLACEMENT BOOSTER INSTALLED TO REPLACE THE FAILED BOOSTER WAS THE SAME NUMBER.",
