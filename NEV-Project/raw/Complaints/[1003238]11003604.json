THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A SAFETY HAZARD AND A RECALL SHOULD BE ISSUED BY THE MANUFACTURER.  IF WE ARE IN A CAR ACCIDENT AND THE HANDLE FALLS OFF THE PERSON THAT IS TRYING TO HELP US THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  ALL WE WERE DOING WAS TRYING TO OPEN THE DOOR TO GET MY SON OUT OF HIS CAR SEAT AND IT FELL OFF RIGHT IN OUR HANDS.  UNACCEPTABLE.",
