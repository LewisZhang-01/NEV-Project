I drove the car to the Autozone around the corner (car drove like [XXX]!) they put it on a diagnostic and the code P2138 popped up\u2026code has Something to do with the Throttle Pedal Position Sensor!!??\u2026I'm currently waiting for my appointment at the Chevy Dealership to see about getting it fixed\u2026Apparently this is a common issue amongst a plethora of GM vehicles and the fact that Chevy hasn\u2019t done a recall on this issue is a [XXX] Joke!!! You all are going to get someone KILLED!! hell I could\u2019ve lost my life had I not been such a reactive driver and in the speeding lane which allowed me to immediately pull over!!
