HAVE HAD THE CAR COMPLETELY STALL OUT ON THE FREEWAY AND PUT ITSELF INTO \"NEAUTRAL\" WHILE AT FREEWAY SPEEDS.  MAINTENANCE AIRBAG LIGHTS FREQUENTLY COMING ON.  CHRYSLER CAN'T SEEM TO FIND A FIX TO THE ISSUE ON WHY THIS CAR IS DOING WHAT IT HAS BEEN.  THEY KEEP SAYING ITHE ISSUE IS FIXED WHEN PUBLICLY THERE IS NO REAL FIX TO THE ISSUE AND THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX THE RE ACCRUING PROBLEM.  LITTLE TO SAY,  I AM DEATHLY AFRAID OF DRIVING THIS VEHICLE EVEN DOWN THE STREET TO MY LOCAL GROCERY STORE.  I WORK TOO HARD AND PAY TO MUCH FOR MY FIRST BRAND NEW CAR TO BE HAVING ISSUES LIKE THESE.  I REALLY WISH CHRYSLER WOULD RECALL ALL OF THESE VEHICLES ALREADY BEFORE SOMEONE ENDS UP LOOSING A LIFE OVER A FAULTY LEMON OF A VEHICLE.",
