I DROVE ON CITY STREETS TO THE GAS STATION AND IN A FEW MINUTES, THE COMPUTER SUDDENLY WOKE UP BY ITSELF AND HAS BEEN FINE SINCE. JUST CALLED THE SERVICE DEPT. WOMAN SAID NO ONE HAS CALLED ABOUT A PROBLEM LIKE THIS, BUT THEY'D BE HAPPY TO RUN A DIAGNOSTIC FOR $100. I'VE BEEN DOWN THIS ROAD BEFORE WITH MY OLD PRIUS. THEY'LL RUN THE DIAGNOSTIC AND TELL ME THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG BECAUSE THEY CAN'T RECREATE THE PROBLEM. MEANWHILE I'LL BE OUT $100 AND MY TIME. AND LOOKING AT FORUMS ON THE INTERNET, THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR OTHER HONDA OWNERS, SO HONDA NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. IT CAN BE A SAFETY ISSUE. DRIVE BY WIRE IS DANGEROUS IF MANUFACTURERS CAN'T GET RELIABLE SOFTWARE. WE'LL SEE IF I HEAR BACK FROM THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OR NOT ABOUT TSB OR SOFTWARE UPDATES. I DOUBT IT.",
