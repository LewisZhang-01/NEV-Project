THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO TWO DEALERS: (1) 1ST LIBERTY GMC IN PEORIA, AZ AND (2) DESERT SUN GMC IN ALAMO GORDO, NM. THE FIRST DEALER NOTICED A LEAK, REPLACED A LINE, RECHARGED THE SYSTEM, BUT THE FAILURE CONTINUED MONTHS LATER. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE FIRST DEALER WHO REPEATED THE SAME SOLUTION, WHICH PROVIDED NO REMEDY AS THE HOT AIR CONTINUED TO EMIT FROM THE AIR CONDITIONER. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE SECOND DEALER FOR FURTHER DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. THE CONTACT WAS UNCERTAIN IF THE MANUFACTURER WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION TO THE DEALER TO REPAIR. THE MANUFACTURER WAS TO FOLLOW UP WITH A RESPONSE WITHIN 48 HRS AND THE CONTACT WAS WAITING FOR A SOLUTION. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS NOT AVAILABLE.",
