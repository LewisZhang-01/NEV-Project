        "summary": "I HAD RECALL 10V073000 PERFORMED BY THE DEALER DUE TO NOTICING MY STEERING WAS GETTING TIGHT THEN SLOPPY. THE DEALER REPLACED THE MOTOR AND SAID THE SLOP IN THE STEERING WAS A BAD INTERMEDIATE STEERING SHAFT. SO I BOUGHT THAT AND HAD IT INSTALLED, NOT AT THE DEALER BECAUSE THEY WHERE RIDICULOUS IN PRICE, AND IT FIXED NOTHING. THERE WAS STILL SLOP AND WANDERING WHILE DRIVING. AFTER A WHILE, MAKING LEFT TURNS I WOULD HEAD A CLUNK AND IT WOULD STILL BE DIFFICULT TO TURN. THEN WHILE MAKING A SLOW LEFT TURN IT WAS REALLY TIGHT AND THEN A LOUD CLUNK THEN THE STEERING BECAME REALLY LOOSE AND THE VEHICLE LOST STEERING UNTIL I TURNED THE WHEEL MORE AND IT FINALLY GRABBED. IT HAPPENS MORE FREQUENTLY NOW. I WAS TOLD THE RACK IS NOW DAMAGED. THE INTERMEDIATE SHAFT THAT WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE DEALER WAS AN INCORRECT DIAGNOSIS WHEN I HAD THE RECALL PERFORMED. THE FAILURE OF THE MOTOR PUT EXCESS STRESS ON THE RACK WHICH CAUSED THE GEARS TO WEAR IS WHAT AN INDEPENDENT SHOP TOLD ME. GM IS TELLING ME THAT I HAVE TO SPEND MORE MONEY TO GET A \"PROPER DIAGNOSIS\" FROM THE DEALER WHEN AT THE TIME THE RECALL WAS PERFORMED THEY HAD DIAGNOSED IT INCORRECTLY.",
