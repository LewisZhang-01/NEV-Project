THEY PERFORMED THE UPDATE BUT FAILED TO TELL ME ANYTHING ELSE. LAST WEEK CAR DID THE SAME EXACT THING, CALLED DEALERSHIP SPOKE WITH THE SERVICE MANAGER AND HE INFORMED ME THAT CHRYSLER HAD DESIGNED THE CAR TO SHUT OFF WITH NO WARNING LIGHTS AT ALL. THE ISSUE HE SAID WAS THE MOTOR USING OIL AT APPROXIMATELY 21,589 MILES. I EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS WITH HIM AND ALSO CALLED CHRYSLER AND THEY AGAIN TOLD ME THE EXACT THING THAT IT IS NOT SUPPOSE TO GIVE YOU A WARNING IT WAS MADE WHEN THE OIL GETS LOW THE CAR WILL SHUT OFF.  MY CONCERNS IS ME OR SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO BE SEVERELY HURT OR EVEN KILLED. WHEN I CHECKED THE OIL LEVEL IN MY CAR IT BARELY REACHED THE END OF THE DIP STICK. LUCKILY I WAS ON THE STREET I LIVED ON WHEN THIS TOOK PLACE. I RESEARCHED THE COMPLAINT ON LINE AND THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM SINCE 2017.",
