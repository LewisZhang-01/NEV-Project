        "summary": "I WAS TRAVELING AT ABOUT 50 MPH ON AN ASPHALT ROAD, AND FOR NO REASON AT ALL, MY SIDE CURTAIN AIRBAGS SUDDENLY DEPLOYED FOR NO REASON AT ALL..  THE ROAD HAD NO POTHOLES, AND MY VEHICLE HAD NOT VEERED FROM THE ROAD.  I COULD NOT SEE THE CURB BECAUSE ONCE INFLATED, THE AIRBAGS WOULD NOT DEFLATE AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT MANEUVER MY VEHICLE OUT OF TRAFFIC AS I COULD NOT SEE FROM ANY OF MY SIDE WINDOWS.  I ENDED UP HITTING THE CURB AT ABOUT 40 MPH, AND FLATTENED BOTH PASSENGER TIRES AND SEVERELY DENTING BOTH RIMS AS WELL.  HAD A MORE UNEXPERIENCED DRIVER LIKE MY DAUGHTER BEEN DRIVING AT THE TIME, THIS MALFUNCTION COULD HAVE EASILY COST US WITH HER LIFE.  I WAS ON A SMOOTH ROAD, TRAVELING IN A STRAIGHT LINE, IN VERY LIGHT TRAFFIC.  THERE WAS NO REASON WHATSOEVER FOR THESE AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY!  I SPOKE WITH MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND AFTER GIVING MY VIN, THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE SIDE CURTAIN AIRBAGS, BUT THAT IT WASN'T TECHNICALLY A RECALL YET, BECAUSE THEY HAVE YET TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM.  HOWEVER, WHEN I SPEAK TO CORPORATE, THEY COMPLETELY DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE OF ANYONE EVER HAVING SUCH A PROBLEM.  YET WHEN I LOOK ONLINE AT TAHOE FORUMS, THE NUMBER ONE COMPLAINT THAT I SEE ON EVERY SINGLE SITE, IS THAT THE SIDE CURTAIN AIRBAGS DEPLOY FOR NO REASON AT ALL...",
