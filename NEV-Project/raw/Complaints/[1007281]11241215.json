I THOUGHT IT WAS A  SOFTWARE UPDATE AS I AM A FAMILY THAT OWNS TESLA, BUT IT WASN'T BECAUSE SUDDENLY THE ABILITY TO STEER AND BREAK OR COMPROMISED AND THE CAR HAD SPED WITHOUT ANY INDICATION AS TO WHY. I REPORTED IT TO TESLA AND THE EARLIEST THEY COULD SET FOR AN APPOINTMENT WITH SEVERAL WEEKS LATER. WITHIN ONE WEEK OF THIS INCIDENT INITIALLY OCCURRING, THIS HAPPENED AGAIN DURING TRAFFIC AND MY CAR INSTEAD OF BREAKING, INCREASED TREMENDOUSLY AND SMASHED INTO A CAR IN FRONT OF ME. I HAD CONTACTED. TESLA LETTING THEM KNOW THAT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED I WAS VERY LUCKY BECAUSE I WASN'T ON THE HIGHWAY, BUT 95% OF MY COMMUTE IS ON MAJOR HIGHWAYS IN THE BAY AREA. I SAID THIS COULD BE DANGEROUS AND I REALLY THINK THIS NEEDS TO BE LOOKED UP FASTER, I GOT ZERO RESPONSE. SO WHEN THIS HAPPENED THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING I COULD DO AND I ROLLED AND SPRAINED MY ANKLE VERY AGGRESSIVELY. NOT ONLY THAT BUT ALL OF THE AIRBAGS IN THE ENTIRE CAR MALFUNCTIONED EVEN THOUGH I WAS ABLE TO FOCUS THE BRUNT OF THE DAMAGE TO THE RIGHT FRONT. UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE BACK WINDOWS DIDN'T OPEN NOR DID THE PASSENGER LOWER AIRBAG. THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT BUT IF THERE WAS THAT WOULD HAVE NOT GONE OFF AND THAT'S NOT OK. THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THIS TO HAPPEN AND THERE WERE NO UPDATES ON SOFTWARE THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN AND THE CAR WAS FIVE WEEKS OLD. TESLA HAS REFUSED TO PROVIDE ME WITH THEIR DATA AND I HAVE AN SSD THAT SHOWS MY CAR SHUT DOWN.",
