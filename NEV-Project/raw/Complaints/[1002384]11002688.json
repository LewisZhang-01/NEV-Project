I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET A REPLACEMENT DATE FOR THIS AIR BAG FROM MY TOYOTA DEALER; I.E., LEXUS OF WAYZATA, 16100 WAYZATA BLVD., WAYZATA, MN 55391, (952) 475-6111.  I UNDERSTAND THAT HAVING AN OLDER MODEL VEHICLE PUTS MY PASSENGER AT GREAT RISK TO INJURY DUE TO THE DETERIORATION OF THE PROPELLANT.  THE SUGGESTED REMEDY OF NOT USING THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT SEEMS HARDLY REASONABLE FOR AN UNKNOWN LENGTH OF TIME.  I SHOULD AT LEAST BE GIVEN A REPLACEMENT DATE OR A REPLACEMENT VEHICLE.",
