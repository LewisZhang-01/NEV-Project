ABOUT ONE HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER THE BMW BURST INTO FLAMES CAUSING FIRE DAMAGE TO MY VEHICLE.  THE INSURANCE COMPANY FOR THE BMW HAS CLOSED THE CLAIM SAYING THE FIRE WAS NOT INTENTIONAL THEREFORE THEY ARE NOT PAYING ANYTHING FOR MY CLAIM.  MY INSURANCE COMPANY IS PAYING FOR REPAIRS TO MY CAR, HOWEVER, I HAVE TO PAY THE DEDUCTIBLE AND COST OF A RENTAL CAR.  AFTER THIS HAPPENED I SAW SEVERAL NEWS REPORTS OF BMW'S BURSTING INTO FLAMES AFTER BEING TURNED OFF FOR A WHILE.  THEY SAID I WAS 0% AT FAULT (OBVIOUSLY), BUT IT DOES NOT SEEM FAIR THAT I HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING FOR THIS INCIDENT.  ALL I DID WAS PARK MY CAR; MY CAR DID NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT.  I HOPE YOU WILL CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE THIS PROBLEM.  I FEEL SEVERAL INCIDENTS ARE FAR TOO MANY FOR BMW TO IGNORE.  THEY CERTAINLY HAVE MORE MONEY THAN I DO.  I HAVE PHOTOS, VIDEO, ETC.",
