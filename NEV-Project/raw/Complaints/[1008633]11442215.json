        "summary": "Torque converter shutter at speeds of 30mph - 45mph causing erratic acceleration fluctuations.   I addressed the concern with the dealership at around 72,000 miles (just out of manufacturers warranty). I told there was a fluid recall. They changed the fluid which remedies the issue.  The transmission fluid has to be changed every 5,000-10,000 for the vehicle to perform with a less noticeable transmission shudder. Manufacturers recommends changing every 30,000 miles to prevent transmission slipping.  I did contact Acura and they dismissed my concerns, stating I drove the vehicle too much. After researching online this seems to be a common concern/problem other Acura MDX owners are experiencing.",
