PRIOR TO MAKING OUR PURCHASE DECISION WE CALLED TOYOTA AND WAS TOLD AIRBAG REPLACEMENTS FOR TOYOTA 4RUNNERS ARE 2 WEEKS OUT, SO WE DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE CAR. WE HAVE CONTACTED TOYOTA EVERY 2 WEEKS SINCE OUR PURCHASE AND EVERY TWO WEEKS WE ARE TOLD THE SAME THING; \"TWO MORE WEEKS.\"  WE WERE TOLD WE CAN NOT HAVE A RENTAL VEHICLE AND FEEL AS IF WE SHOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE.  WE ARE EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THE LACK OF CARE AND INCONVENIENCE THIS HAS CAUSED TO OUR LIVES.  HOW DO WE GET A REALISTIC ANSWER AS TO WHEN THIS SITUATION WILL BE RESOLVED??",
