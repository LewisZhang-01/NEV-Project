        "summary": "AS SOON AS MY VEHICLE REACHED JUST OVER 102,000 MILES, MY ENGINE COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN WHILE WE WERE DRIVING OUR KIDS TO PRACTICE. I HAVE TAKEN IT TO THE CHEVY DEALERSHIP THAT HAS BEEN REPAIRING MY VEHICLE SINCE WE PURCHASED IT (1.5 YEARS PRIOR TO THE ENGINE SHUTTING DOWN) AND THEY HAVE INFORMED US WE NEED A COMPLETELY NEW ENGINE BECAUSE THE CRANKSHAFT IS COMPLETELY BLOWN. WHEN THEY FINALLY GOT IT STARTED UP, IT SOUNDED LIKE A BAG OF HAMMERS BEING VIOLENTLY SHAKEN.    IN THE 1.5 YEARS THAT WE HAVE HAD THE VEHICLE, THE TIMING BELT HAS GONE OUT, AN ELECTRICAL ISSUE THAT CAUSED THE CAR TO SHUT DOWN COMPLETELY AS WELL, AND ANOTHER REPAIR THAT MY HUSBAND HANDLED SHORTLY AFTER WE GOT THE CAR.    CHEVY HAS TOLD US WE ARE OUT OF LUCK AND THAT WE HAVE TO PAY FOR A NEW ENGINE. WHEN THE DEALERSHIP CHECKED THE VALUE OF THE VEHICLE BECAUSE WE WERE GOING TO TRY TO TRADE IT IN, THEY TOLD US THE CAR, IN PERFECT WORKING CONDITION WOULD ONLY BE WORTH $6,000.00, EVEN THOUGH 1.5 YEARS PRIOR, IT WAS WORTH $20,000. THE ENGINE REPLACEMENT IS GOING TO COST US MORE THAN THE VEHICLE IS WORTH! FROM WHAT WE HAVE SEEN, A LOT OF THESE CARS (SAME YEAR MAKE AND MODEL) ARE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS AND SHOULD BE RECALLED COMPLETELY!",
