IT IS MIRACULOUS THAT A SERIOUS ACCIDENT AND INJURIES DID NOT OCCUR.    MY SNOWBOARD EQUIPMENT (NOW DESTROYED) WAS BRAND NEW AND OVER $1000 SO I HAD PAID SPECIAL ATTENTION TO ENSURING THAT THE RETENTION BAR WAS FULLY CLOSED WITH THE RELEASE BUTTON FULLY EXTENDED AND THAT THE LOCKING MECHANISM WAS ENGAGED (THE KEY IS NOT SUPPOSED TO TURN IN THE LOCK IF THE BAR ISN'T CLOSED FULLY).  AS SOON AS THE SNOWBOARD FLEW INTO TRAFFIC BEHIND ME I PULLED OFF THE HIGHWAY AND VERIFIED THAT THE RELEASE BUTTON WAS STILL FULLY EXTENDED AND LOCKED (YOU CANNOT PUSH THE BUTTON TO RELEASE THE BAR WHEN IT IS LOCKED).",
