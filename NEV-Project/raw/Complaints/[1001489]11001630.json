        "summary": "THE CAR BLEW THE ENGINE OIL COOLER PIPE  LEAKING PROFUSELY I DROVE IT AT NIGHT CAME HOME AND THERE WAS A 12 X 12 OIL LEAK IN MY GARAGE. I PULLED IT OUT OF THE GARAGE WITH THE MOTOR  RUNNING AND THERE WAS ANOTHER 12 X 12 OIL SPILL ON MY DRIVE WAY. I HAVE A LINE ALL THE WAY DOWN MY STREET OF THE OIL SPEWING OUT OF THE ENGINE . I HAD TO GET THE CAR TOWED THE FOLLOWING DAY TO TOYOTA WHO KNEW ABOUT THE PART AND OFFERED AN EXTENDED 10 YEAR WARRANTY TO FIX THIS PROBLEM. THERE WAS ONLY 2 QUARTS OF OIL LEFT IN THE CRANK CASE. NO LOW OIL LIGHT CAME ON. I WOULD HAVE BLOWN MY MOTOR FOR SURE IF I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY. THERE IS A VIDEO FROM TOYOTA ABOUT THE ENGINE OIL COOLER PIPE LEAKING AND THAT THEY CHANGED THE PART FROM RUBBER HOSES TO METAL. WHY WAS THERE NOT A RECALL ON THIS PART. IT IS NOT A MATTER OF IF IT WILL FAIL BUT WHEN. THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED A SERIOUS SITUATION!",
