        "summary": "THE CAR WOULD LOSE A QUART OF ANTI FREEZE EVERY 7500 MILES.I BROUGHT IT IN AT LEAST 8 TIMES TELLING THEM THERE WAS A PROBLEM. THEY PRESSURE TESTED THE VEHICLE AT LEAST 8 TIMES AND 2 SERVICE MANAGERS SAID I WAS NUTS THEY ARE BOTH FIRED. MY 20 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER DRIVES FROM NEW YORK TO FLORIDA. I ASKED A SERVICE MANAGER WHEN THE CAR HAD APPROX, 55K TO GIVE THIS CAR TO A MECHANIC, SERVICE WRITER OR HIM SELF TO GO ON VACATION WITH A FREE CAR. THE SERVICE MANAGER  DECLINED SAYING THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE CAR AND WOULD NOT LET ANYBODY TAKE THE CAR. I WAS IN TOUCH WITH SUBARU CUSTOMER CARE MANY TIMES . FINALLY THE CAR HIT 74K IN VIRGINIA WHEN THE TRANSMISSION WENT BAD. TOWED TO A SUBARU DEALER IN VIRGINIA AT ABOUT 6AM. THANKFULLY MY OLDEST SON WAS IN THE CAR WITH HER COMING TO FLORIDA. THEY AT THE DEALER SAID IT WOULD BE $8000 TO FIX THE CAR. THE DEALER MUST OF CALLED SUBARU CUSTOMER CARE AND EXPLAINED BECAUSE THEY WOULD COVER $5000 AND I WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE REST. WE GOT THE CAR BACK AND WENT 3500 MILES AND NO ANTI FREEZE LOST. THE ANTI FREEZE WAS ALWAYS CHECKED IN THE MORNING BEFORE STARTING IT UP. I CALLED SUBARU C.C AND THE GUY REVIEWED THE PROBLEM AND GAVE ME ALL MY MONEY BACK. I ALSO SAW ON THE INTERNET ANOTHER CAR WITH 68K HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.",
