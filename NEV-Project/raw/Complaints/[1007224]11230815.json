I HAVE A SIMILAR PROBLEM WITH THE SAME DOOR ON MY 2014 OUTBACK, IN THAT THE CHILD LOCK IS STUCK IN THE LOCKED POSITION AND THE DOOR CANNOT BE OPENED FROM THE INSIDE. I DON'T THINK IT'S A COINCIDENCE THAT BOTH OF MY SUBARUS ARE HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THE CHILD SAFETY LOCKS AND I WOULD LIKE THIS INVESTIGATED.",
