THIS IS A 2 SEAT PICKUP TRUCK WHICH MEANS I CAN NOT USE THIS VEHICLE WITH ANYONE BUT MYSELF. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO USE THIS TO TRANSPORT  FAMILY MEMBERS ? THIS RECALL WAS ISSUED ON JUNE OF 2016 WHICH IS 18 MONTHS AGO.    WHY IS FORD BEING ALLOWED TO PUT OFF FIXING A SAFETY DEFECT FOR 18 MONTHS AND IS NOW TELLING OWNERS THEY CAN'T HAVE ANYONE ELSE IN THE VEHICLE BUT THE DRIVER.     THIS IS MY SECOND EMAIL REGARDING THIS RECALL THE FIRST WAS SUBMITTED IN MAY OF 2017, I HEARD NOTHING BACK FROM THE NTSB REGARDING  MY FIRST COMPLAINT.    THIS LATEST UPDATE FROM FORD IS AN OUTRAGE WHICH BASICALLY LEAVES ME WITH A VEHICLE THAT I CANNOT USE TO TRANSPORT FAMILY MEMBERS. WITH NO REMEDY FROM FORD    SEE THE 'WARNING' SECTION FROM THE LETTER IN THE IMAGE ATTACHED",
