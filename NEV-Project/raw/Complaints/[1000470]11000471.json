THERE IS NO MEANS OF KEEPING THE HATCH DOWN AS FAR AS POSSIBLE SO EXHAUST FUMES, RAIN, ETC... GETS INTO THE CAR.  ALSO WITH THE HATCH TOTAL OPEN THE BRAKE WARNING  LIGHT AND BACKUP CAMERA POINT TOWARDS THE SKY AND MAKES THE CAR MORE DANGEROUS.  SOME TYPE OF METHOD SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY TOYOTA TO SECURE THE BACK HATCH LIKE A \"D RING\" .  THIS IS PROVIDED IN THE3 CAR TO SECURE LUGGAGE IN THE BACK BUT NO THOUGHT WAS GIVEN TO SECURING THE HATCH WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE PARTIALLY OPEN.",
