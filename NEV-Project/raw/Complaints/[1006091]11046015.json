AFTER SEARCHING ABOUT THIS COMPLAINT ONLINE ON NUMEROUS FORUMS RELATING TO THE VOLKSWAGEN, I FOUND THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM EXPERIENCED BY OTHER OWNERS ACROSS DIFFERENT YEARS. THIS PROBLEM HAS EVEN OCCURRED WHILE PEOPLE ARE DRIVING AND IT SHUTS OFF THE CAR.     I CONTACTED VOLKSWAGEN THINKING THAT THEY SHOULD BE HELD LIABLE FOR THIS DEFECT AFFECTING MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL SAFETY THREAT IT POSES TO THE DRIVERS. WELL, THEY DID NOT CARE THAT THIS PROBLEM IS HAPPENING AND THEY DO NOT THINK IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND WILL NOT PAY TO FIX IT. BUT HOW CAN IT NOT BE WHEN IT TURNS THE CAR OFF??",
