SOMETIMES THE VEHICLE ABRUPTLY STOPS WHILE TURNING OR SOMETIMES THE CAR CUTS ALL THE WAY OFF. I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN 2010 AND I HAVE REPORTED THIS PROBLEM SINCE 2013. OVERTIME I TOOK THE VEHICLE BACK TO THE DEALER AND THEY WOULD TELL ME THAT THEY COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. I RECENTLY HAD MAJOR ENGINE PROBLEMS INVOLVING THE LIFTERS ACCORDING TO THEIR DIAGNOSTIC MACHINE. THE COST WAS 6000 TO REPAIR. AFTER REPAIRING THE LIFTERS THE CAR STILL HAS THE SPONTANEOUS ACCELERATING AND STOPPING ISSUES.WE WERE TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER AT CHEVROLET THAT WE SHOULD \"JUST DUMP THE VEHICLE AND THEY HAD A HYBRID IN THE BACK THEY HAD OVER A MONTH AND THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHATS WRONG WITH IT\". I PAID OVER 38,000 FOR THIS TRUCK AT THEIR DEALER SHIP. IVE INVESTED THOUSANDS IN REPAIR COSTS. I WON'T SELL IT BECAUSE I KNOW IT HAS SAFETY HAZARDS. I DRIVE WITH CAUTION BECAUSE I DON'T  KNOW WHEN TO EXPECT THE CAR TO ACCELERATE.",
