SMELL DISSAPATES AFTER A WHILE BUT ALWAYS HAPPENS UNDER THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED  CONDITIONS. FORD DEALERSHIP HAS SEEN THE VEHICLE TWICE FOR THIS ISSUE AND IS SEEING IT AGAIN TOMORROW FOR THE SAME THING. FIRST VISIT THEY REPLACED SOME MOULDING AND RESEALED STUFF IN THE REAR END. SECOND VISIT THEY REPLACED THE EXHAUST SYSTEM. NEITHER OF THESE ACTIONS RESOLVED THE ISSUE, I HAVE JUST LEARNED THAT A POLICE OFFICER IN THE US PASSED OUT DRIVING A FORD EXPLORER HAVING THE SAME ISSUES. I HAVE A WIFE AND TWO SMALL CHILDREN AND I FEAR FOR THEIR SAFETY GIVEN THE TOXIC FUMES CONTAINED IN AUTOMOTIVE EXHAUST.",
