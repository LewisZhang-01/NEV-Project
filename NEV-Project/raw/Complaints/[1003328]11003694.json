THEY GAVE BACK THE CAR 3 TIMES WITHOUT PROPER DIAGNOSIS AND IT KEPT STALLING AT DIFFERENT TIMES. I HAD TO OPEN UP A CASE AT CHRYSLER AND EXPLAIN THEM THE RISK OF DRIVING THIS VEHICLE WHEN IT CUTS OFF ON FREEWAY AND FINALLY AT 4TH ATTEMPT IT WAS FIXED. THEY MENTIONED THAT THE RECALL WHICH WAS PERFORMED IN JUNE WAS NOT DONE PROPERLY. 2017, I WENT IN FOR ANOTHER RECALL AND JUST AFTER A MONTH AGAIN IN JUNE 2017 I AM HAVING THIS ISSUE AGAIN. THE ENGINE STALLED ON ME WHEN I WAS ON FIRST LANE ON FREEWAY, AGAIN A RISK EXPERIENCE. THE CAR IS WITH DEALERSHIP SINCE LAST 15 DAYS AND THEY ARE ALSO ABLE TO RECREATE THE ISSUE. THERE IS SOMETHING REALLY WRONG WITH THIS YEAR'S MODEL AND I HAVE SEEN OTHER COMPLAINTS AS WELL FROM OTHER OWNERS. I AM SELLING THIS CAR AS SOON AS THIS IS FIXED.",
