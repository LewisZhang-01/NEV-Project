WAS TOLD AT FIRESTONE STORE TIRES WERE AT 5/32 AND NOTHING THEY COULD DO BECAUSE TIRES WERE NOT AT 4/32.  CONCERNED BECAUSE FAMILY CAR, TIRES SHOULD NOT START TO WEAR AT LESS THAN 17,000 MILES.  AT 16,886 MILES WHILE MY WIFE WAS DRIVING DOWN THE CITY ROAD AT 40 MPH, 2 FIRESTONE TIRES BLEW OUT.  MY CONCERN IS MORE TIRES ARE ON ROAD AND THERE HAS TO BE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BATCH OF TIRES.  FIRESTONE STILL WILL NOT SAY THEY ARE IN WRONG.",
