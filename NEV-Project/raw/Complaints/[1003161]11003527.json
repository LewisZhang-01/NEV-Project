        "summary": "THESE ARE THE PHOTOS TAKE OF THE FUEL PUMP AFTER IT WAS REMOVED BY MATHIS AUTO SERVICE (SEE THE ATTACHED INVOICE). AS YOU CAN SEE THE TAG HAS ONLY A SMALL PART OF A BAR CODE, I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THIS WAS THE PART NUMBER OR NOT, BUT IT SEEM THERE WAS NO NUMBER. THE TOP OF THE PUMP WAS VERY DIRTY AND WET FROM GASOLINE. I HAD THE FUEL PUMP REPLACE AFTER I WAS TRANSPORTING A CLIENT AND THE CAR STARTED SPUTTERING AND LOST POWER FROM 45-MILES-PER HOUR TO ABOUT 10-MILES PER HOUR, BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO TURN INTO A PARKING LOT. THIS SCARED THE CLIENT AND LEAD THEM TO REPORT TO LYFT ABOUT THE INCIDENT. I ALSO REPORTED THE ISSUE TO LYFT RIDE SHARE AND THEY SHUT DOWN MY VEHICLE FOR SAFETY REASONS BY DEACTIVATING MY ACCOUNT. SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD THE CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP TO COMPLETE 4 RECALLS, WHICH DID NOT CLEAR UP THE PROBLEM. OR CORRECT THE FUEL PUMP FROM SEIZING UP AND STALLING OUT. I PAID FOR THE REPLACEMENT PART OF A NEW FUEL PUMP AND EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WORKING PROPERLY. AND MY ACCOUNT HAS BEEN REACTIVATED WITH LYFT. I SPOKE TO TI AUTOMOTIVE CEO, ABOUT THEIR RECALL ON THEIR FUEL PUMP SEIZE, STOPPING THE FUEL FLOW TO THE ENGINE CREATING A STALLING CONDITION. I WAS TOLD THESE ISSUE WAS ONLY IN 2010 MODELS AND THEY WILL NOT REPAIR OR ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEFECTS IN EARLIER MODELS OF CHEVY MALIBU. BUT THERE ARE ISSUES WITH OTHER YEARS MODELS STALLING OUT IN TRAFFIC.",
