WITHIN TWO WEEKS BEFORE I HAD 300 MILES ON THE VEHICLE I EXPERIENCED WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS POWER LOSS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION DURING A U-TURN. THIS U-TURN WAS NOT AS ACCELERATED SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF 10-15 MPH, WAS ON DRY PAVED ASPHALT. I CHALKED IT UP FOR WHAT I WAS HOPING TO BE A ONE TIME OFFENSE. HOWEVER, IT HAS NOW HAPPENED ONCE AGAIN ON DRY PAVED ROADS ON A CLEAR DAY. THIS TIME I NOTICED THE TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT WENT CRAZY, JUST BLINKING AWAY. THE RENEGADE ROLLED A FOOT OR SO BECAUSE I WAS ONLY GOING 5 MPH DURING THIS U-TURN WHEN THE RENEGADE LOST POWER.     AFTER SOME RESEARCH IT SEEMS THE RENEGADE ON-BOARD COMPUTER MUST THINK THE JEEP IS TIPPING AND AS A SAFETY PRECAUTION CUTS POWER TO THE VEHICLE TO PREVENT A ROLLOVER. I'M NO EXPERT, BUT I'M PRETTY POSITIVE A VEHICLE DOES NOT TIP IN THE MIDDLE OF A U-TURN, ON DRY PAVEMENT, AND GOING 5 MPH.     I HAVE A FAMILY, A 18 MONTH OLD AND A PREGNANT WIFE. I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE PUTTING MY FAMILY IN THIS BRAND NEW VEHICLE. I DON'T EVEN FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS ANYMORE. WHO KNOWS WHEN IT WILL DECIDE TO LOSE POWER AGAIN AND GET ME OR MY FAMILY SEVERELY INJURED OR WORSE.     CHRYSLER NEEDS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. THIS WAS MY FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE CHRYSLER COMPANY...JEEP BRAND. I'VE NEVER OWNED ONE BEFORE AND AM NOT SURE IF BUYING CHRYSLER IS SAFE FOR MY FAMILY AT THIS POINT.",
