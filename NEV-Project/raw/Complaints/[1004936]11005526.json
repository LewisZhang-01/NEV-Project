        "summary": "I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE RECENTLY AND WAS TAKING IT TO HAVE IT SAFETY INSPECTED. DRIVING DOWN A CURVY ROAD, THE VEHICLE BECAME DIFFICULT TO STEER STRAIGHT. A LOUD THUNKING NOISE WAS COMING FROM THE PASSENGER REAR QUARTER. UPON INSPECTION IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR LOWER 4 LINK FRAME ATTACHMENT TOWER (JUST FORWARD OF THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR WHEEL AND TIRE) HAD DETACHED FROM THE FRAME. THIS CONDITION SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SEVERE METAL DETERIORATION FROM THE INSIDE OUT, HIDING ITSELF UNTIL IT PERFORATED THE FRAME. ON FURTHER INSPECTION THE FRAME WAS FOUND TO BE PERFORATED ALL ALONG THE LOWER INSIDE WALL - FROM THE 4 LINK TOWER TO THE MIDDLE CROSSMEMBER ATTACH POINT . THIS AREA OF THE FRAME IS ADJACENT TO THE MUFFLER AND IS EXPOSED TO EXAGGERATED THERMAL CYCLING ON A DAILY BASIS. SOME METALLURGICAL REACTION TO THIS CONDITION IS CAUSING EXTREME CORROSION OF THE FRAME RAILS TO THE POINT OF FAILURE. THIS IS HAPPENING TO A LOT OF 1999 TO 2003 4RUNNERS  IN THE SAME EXACT SPOT AND IT'S GOING TO GET SOMEONE SERIOUSLY HURT OR KILLED. MANY PEOPLE ARE UNAWARE ANYTHING IS AMISS UNTIL THEY POKE AROUND THE AREA OF THE INSIDE FRAME RAIL.",
