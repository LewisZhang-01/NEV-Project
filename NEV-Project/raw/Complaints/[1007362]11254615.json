ON 5/27 I HAD TO HAVE THE DASH INSTRUMENT PANEL REPLACED DUE TO FAILURE, WHICH I HAVE VIDEO RECORD OF. ON 7/10 I HAD TO HAVE THE PARK SENSOR REPLACED DUE TO FAILURE & THE VEHICLE THROWING ITSELF INTO PARK INSTRUCTING ME THAT DOOR WAS AJAR WHEN IT WASN'T. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE IF THIS HAD HAPPENED WHILE I WAS DOING 70MPH ON THE FREEWAY. MY VIN IS NOT SHOWING IN ANY OF THE RECALLS, HOWEVER THREE RECALLS PERTAIN TO ME. SO I NEED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO TO MAKE PPL AWARE OF THESE RECALLS. MY VIN NEEDS TO BE ADDED TO THE LIST. I HAVE ALL REPAIR REPORTS NEEDED TO PROVE MY VEHICLE IS A SAFETY ISSUE. I HAVE REPETITIVELY ASKED JEEP TO PLACE ME IN A SAFER MORE RELIABLE VEHICLE AND THEY REFUSE TO RETURN MY CALLS OR ASSIST ME IN ANY WAY, STATING THAT 'THIS IS WHY WE HAVE WARRANTIES' SOMEONE NEEDS TO CONTACT ME ABOUT THIS ISSUE. I NEED HELP BEFORE MY VEHICLE RESULTS IN A FATAL CRASH NO KILLS MY FAMILY AND ME. I AM NOTING THAT I CONTACTED THE NHTSA ABOUT THIS ISSUE ON 9/11 AND AM AWAITING A RESPONSE.",
