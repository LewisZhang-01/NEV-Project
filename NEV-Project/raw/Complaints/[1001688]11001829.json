IT STARTED TO MAKE A TWITCHING NOISE AS IF SOMETHING ELECTRICAL WAS WRONG. I GOT IT JUMPED..BOUGHT A NEW BATTERY AND IT WORKED FINE FOR 6 DAYS. NOW, IT WILL NOT START AT ALL UNLESS IT IS JUMPED. IT ALSO LOCKS THE KEYS IN THE IGNITION IF I TRIED TO START IT WITHOUT A JUMP.  THE CAR CONTINUES TO MAKE A TWITCHING NOISE WHEN IDLE.  IM AM AGRAID OF A FIRE IGNITING.  I NOTICE THAT EACH TIME I HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE CAR , IT HAD RAINED SIGNIFICANTLY THOSE DAYS.  I KNOW OF ANOTHER OWNER THAT IS HAVING A SIMILAR PROBLEM WITB THEIR 2008 BUICK ENCLAVE. PLEASE HELP!",
