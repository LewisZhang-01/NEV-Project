        "summary": "OVER THE LAST ++18 MONTHS, WHEN AC IS ON, THE TRUCK IDLE WILL IDLE AT ABOUT 1500-1800RPM.  AFTER HAVING MECHANIC DO A COUPLE THROTTLE BODY CLEANING IT DID COME DOWN BELOW 1000-1200RPM.  FOR THE LAST 5 MONTHS, WHEN SHIFTING (EITHER UP OR DOWN) BETWEEN 4TH & 5TH GEAR, THE ENGINE SURGE TO 3200-3600 RPM AS SOON AS CLUTCH IS DEPRESSED + ACCELERATOR IS RELEASED.  IN 2011 WHEN THE DEALER DID RECALL # 09V388000, THE ENGINE SURGING ISSUE WAS NOT THAT AS SEVERE AS IT IS TODAY.  IN LAST 3 MONTHS, BESIDE ENGINE REVVING UP , I STARTED GETTING ENGINE ERROR CODES.  07/12/2017 TOOK MY TACOMA TRUCK TO DEALER FOR AVAILABLE RECALLS:  12V092: AIR BAG SPIRAL CABLE  13V337: SEAT BELTS  14V604: REAR LEAF SPRINGS; THESE BROKE IN JANUARY 2013 & I REPLACED BOTH SIDES    WITH SKYJACKERS TCR515S (4LEAFS) AND I HAVE NO INTENTION TO REPLACE THEM.  I THINK THAT IN EARLY 2011, THE DEALER DID RECALL 09V388000 BUT THIS DEALER COULD NOT FIND ANY REFERENCE TO IT SO THEY WOULD NOT ADDRESS THAT ISSUE; BUT HE WOULD WANT TO OPEN ENGINE TO CHECK THAT TIMING CHAIN IS NOT DEFECTIVE/ OFF WHICH HE CLAIMED IS THE CAUSE OF THE SURGING BETWEEN 4TH/5TH GEAR. THIS DIAGNOSTIC WOULD BE AT MY COST. I REFUSE BECAUSE I DISAGREE WITH THIS LOGIC, I DO NOT HAVE LOST OF POWER BUT ONLY ENGINE REVVING UP LIKE CRAZY AND HIGH IDDLE WHEN CLUTCH IS DEPRESSED",
