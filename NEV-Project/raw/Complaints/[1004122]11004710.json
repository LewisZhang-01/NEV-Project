ONCE TRAFFIC CLEARED I ACCELERATED THROUGH THE FIRST LANE BUT MY CAR WOULD NOT GO FASTER. MY FOOT WAS ALL THE WAY DOWN ON THE ACCELERATOR. AT A FEW SECONDS AND NEAR MISS COLLISION MY CAR DECIDED TO FINALLY GO. IT FELT LIKE IT STALLED AND I HAD NO CONTROL. THIS ONLY HAPPENS IN THE SUMMER AND ALL I CAN THINK OF IS THAT THE CAR IS GETTING TO HOT.",
