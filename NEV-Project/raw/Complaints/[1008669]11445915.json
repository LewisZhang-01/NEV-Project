        "summary": "The contact's husband owns a 2012 Ford Explorer. The contact stated that upon startup of the vehicle, the power steering assist had failed as the power steering assist fault warning light illuminated on the instrument panel. After another man attempted to steer the vehicle, the contact left the vehicle in the parking lot and got a ride home. The next day, the contract called for a tow; however, the power steering functionality returned. With the tow truck following behind her, the contact was able to drive the vehicle to an independent mechanic. After a diagnostic test was performed, the mechanic informed her that he was not authorized to service the vehicle and advised her to take the vehicle to a dealer. The contact was then able to drive the vehicle to a dealer where she was given an appointment for a diagnostic test. The contact was able to drive the vehicle home and was instructed by the dealer to not drive the vehicle until it was repaired. Upon investigation, the contact linked the failure to NHTSA Campaign Number: 14V286000 (Steering). The manufacturer had yet to be notified of the failure. The vehicle had yet to be repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 110,000.",
