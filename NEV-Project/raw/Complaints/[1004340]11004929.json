THE CONTACT WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE VEHICLE. THE CONTACT CALLED FULLER KIA (540 AUTO PARK DR, CHULA VISTA, CA 91911) AND WAS INFORMED TO BRING THE VEHICLE IN THE NEXT WEEK. HOWEVER, THE FAILURE RECURRED. THE CONTACT WAS UNABLE TO RESTART THE VEHICLE AND SAW SMOKE COMING FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT. THERE WAS NO VISIBLE FIRE. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS NOT CONTACTED AND THERE WERE NO INJURIES. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE CONTACT'S HOUSE AND THEN TO FULLER KIA WHERE IT WAS DIAGNOSED THAT THE STARTER FAILED AND THE ENGINE SEIZED. BOTH COMPONENTS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE VIN WAS INCLUDED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 17V224000 (ENGINE); THEREFORE, THE DEALER AGREED TO REPLACE THE ENGINE FREE OF CHARGE. THE DEALER STATED THAT THE STARTER FAILURE WAS A RESULT OF THE CONTACT ATTEMPTING TO RESTART THE VEHICLE. THE STARTER FAILURE WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE RECALL, SO THE CONTACT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR THE STARTER REPLACEMENT. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT REPAIRED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE AND AGREED WITH THE DEALER. THE APPROXIMATE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 94,000.",
