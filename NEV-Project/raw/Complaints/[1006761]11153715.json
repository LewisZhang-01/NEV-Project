NEEDLESS TO SAY I WAS VERY SCARED THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO STOP BUT EVENTUALLY I SLOWED DOWN ENOUGH TO PULL INTO A GAS STATION IN WARSAW, IN.  LUCKILY WHEN THIS HAPPENED THERE WERE VERY FEW OTHER VEHICLES OUT ON THE ROAD OTHERWISE THIS STORY MAY HAVE A DIFFERENT ENDING.  THIS HAPPENED ON HIGHWAY 15 IN MILFORD, IN.",
