IT FEELS AS THOUGH THE TRUCK IS GOING TO GO OUT OF CONTROL OR BREAK DOWN AT ANY MOMENT. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, WE HAVE HAD OUR ENTIRE TRUCK SUSPENSION, ALIGNMENT, BRAKES/ROTORS, ETC INSPECTED NUMEROUS TIMES AND WERE TOLD MORE THAN ONCE BY GM TECHNICIANS THAT THIS VEHICLE PERFORMS UNDER ACCEPTABLE CONDITIONS ACCORDING TO GENERAL MOTORS, EVEN THOUGH THEY AGREE THAT IT DOES NOT FEEL ACCEPTABLE. MY LAST INSPECTION WAS TODAY AND I WAS TOLD THE SAME THING.",
