I CAN NOT AFFORD THE BACK DOOR TO BE FIXED, AND I SHOULDN'T BECAUSE THIS IS AN OBVIOUS DEFECT! THE VEHICLE IS STATIONARY AND IN MOTION WHEN THIS IS HAPPENING. I DON'T EVEN OPEN THE DOOR ANYMORE AS IT TAKES ABOUT THREE DAYS FOR THE SYSTEM TO REGISTER THAT IT IS CLOSED. BUT ONCE OPENED, THE LIGHT STAYS ON!!",
