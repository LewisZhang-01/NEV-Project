A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO, WITH NO WARNING THE TIMING CHAIN BROKE AND BLEW THE ENGINE. I HAD JUST TAKEN IT TO THE DEALERSHIP A COUPLE OF WEEKS PRIOR FOR MAINTENANCE AND THEY SAID EVERYTHING LOOKED GREAT. THE DEALER FIRST TOLD ME IT WAS GOING TO COST OVER 20K TO REPLACE THE ENGINE. BMW GOT INVOLVED AND NOW I'M TOLD IT WILL COST JUST OVER 15K PLUS TAXES. I STARTED CHECKING ONLINE AND NOTICED THAT BMW HAS HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE TIMING CHAIN, HOWEVER THEY DON'T LIST THE X3 AS ONE OF THE CARS WITH THE PROBLEM. AT 4 YEARS OLD AND 50K MILES, I WOULD THINK THE TIMING CHAIN SHOULDN'T BREAK, AND DEFINITELY SHOULDN'T COST 1/3 OF A NEW CAR TO REPAIR.",
