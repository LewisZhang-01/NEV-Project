I brought to service dept and was told they did not know what it was because they could not recreate it. The engine light went on 11/29/21 and I dropped at service. I was told it was the door harness. The service dept confirmed this.They actually told me I could drive but it might randomly stop-I didn't want to risk that because I didn't think it was safe.. I waited 3 months without my car for the part. I was not given a loaner or rental.  I got my car back on 3/1.",
