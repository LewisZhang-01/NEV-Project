TOOK THE VEHICLE TO A KIA DEALER WHO CHECKED THE VEHICLE'S DIAGNOSTIC CODE (B1346) AND TOLD ME THE AIRBAG CLOCK SPRING WAS FAULTY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED .  THIS WAS DONE AFTER THEY ORDERED THE PART  FOR A TOTAL COST TO ME OF $329.72.     THE CLOCK SPRING PROBLEM WAS COVERED UNDER A RECALL FOR 2008 OPTIMAS AND SOME OTHER KIA MODELS.  SINCE THE SRS SYSTEM MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITH A FAULTY AIR BAG CLOCK SPRING, THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY COMPONENT PROBLEM AND SHOULD BE COVERED BY KIA LIKE IT WAS FOR PREVIOUS MODEL YEARS.",
