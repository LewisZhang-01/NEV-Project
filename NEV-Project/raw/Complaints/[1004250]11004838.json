        "summary": "THE VEHICLE WAS IN NEUTRAL, ENGINE RUNNING WITH PARKING BRAKE SET (ELECTRONIC PARKING BRAKE IN THE 2010), THE MECHANIC GOT OUT OF THE CAR ON THE LEVEL CRUSHED GRAVEL PARKING LOT IN THE MIDDLE OF A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY AFTERNOON AND ALLOWED MYSELF TO GET IN THE DRIVERS SEAT.  I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DISENGAGE THE PARKING BRAKE WITHOUT IT FLASHING NON STOP UNLESS I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND RESTARTED IT, THEN DISENGAGE THE PARKING BRAKE.  ON THIS SPECIFIC DAY, I GOT INTO MY VEHICLE ATTEMPTED TO DISENGAGE THE PARKING BRAKE IT STILL WAS SET WITH LIGHT ON.  I TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE, RESTARTED IT AND DISENGAGED THE PARKING BRAKE AND IT IMMEDIATELY STARTED FLASHING.  THE BRAKE WAS DISENGAGED; HOWEVER, THE LIGHT REMAINED ON.  RETURNED IT TO MY MECHANIC AND HE STATED THAT HE WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE ELECTRONIC PARKING BRAKE HOWEVER, IT WAS NOT WORKING AT ALL NOR WOULD IT WOULD WORK.  YOU COULD HEAR THE LITTLE MOTOR RUNNING BUT NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN.  I BROUGHT MY VEHICLE UP TO A SUBARU DEALERSHIP IN HOPES THAT THEY WOULD STAND BEHIND A POORLY DESIGNED PIECE OF EQUIPMENT ON THEIR PRODUCT WHICH AS A CONSUMER SHOULD HAVE LASTED MORE THAN 7 YEARS.  I WAS TOLD THE PARKING BRAKE MODULE PART NEEDS TO BE ORDERED FOR $800 PLUS TAX.  THIS IS VERY DISCOURAGING GIVEN TH RIDICULOUS COST OF SOMETHING YOUR VEHICLE IS REQUIRED TO HAVE FOR STATE INSPECTION.  IT SEEMS OBVIOUS THAT THIS ELECTRONIC PARKING BRAKE WAS NOT A GOOD PRODUCT AS THEY ONLY PLACED THEM ON 2010-2012.  I FEEL THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD STAND BEHIND.",
