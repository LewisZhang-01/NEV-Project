THE AIRBAG STRUCK ME ON THE LEFT SIDE AND I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND WENT INSIDE TO THE ER BECAUSE I WAS ALREADY AT THE HOSPITAL FOR A REGULAR APPOINTMENT. I DID NOT SIT BACK HARD IN THE SEAT, I SIMPLY REACHED BACK FOR MY SEAT BELT AND THE AIRBAG DEPLOYED FROM WITHIN THE DRIVERS SEAT, NOT THE SIDE OF THE CAR.",
