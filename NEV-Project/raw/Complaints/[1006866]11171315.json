IT IS OCCURRING MORE FREQUENTLY.  BROUGHT IT TO THE DEALER BUT THEY COULDN'T DUPLICATE MESSAGE SO THEY DID NOTHING.  THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.  I READ THIS WAS AN ISSUE IN JAN 2017 AND 2018 WITH 2017.  APPARENTLY THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ENGINE CONTROL SOFTWARE UPDATE BUT BECAUSE CHRYSLER DID NOT AUTHORIZE THIS THE SERVICE DEPT AT THE DEALER WILL NOT DO ANYTHING.  EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT TO ANYONE DRIVING.  THIS IS HAPPENING  MORE FREQUENTLY NOW ON MY CAR.  IT USED TO BE ONLY ONCE TODAY WAS THREE TIMES IN TWENTY MINUTES.  ..*BF..  *TR *DT  CONSUMER EXPERIENCING ENGINE STALLS. *JB",
