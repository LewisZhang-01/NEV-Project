        "summary": "I HAVE ISSUES WITH MY DEFROST SYSTEM IN MY 2011 BUICK LACROSSE WHICH IS CAUSING VISIBILITY ISSUES (SAFETY) WHEN I DRIVE. SEVERAL TIMES I HAD TO PULL OFF THE ROAD, ROLL DOWN MY WINDOWS AND TRY TO GET MY WINDSHIELD TO DEFROST SO I COULD SEE TO DRIVE. I LOOKED UP RECALLS ON CARS.COM AND NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ISSUED IN MARCH 2011 FOR 2011 BUICK LACROSSE MODELS FOR THE ECC MODULE DESCRIBING THE EXACT SYSTEMS MY CAR IS HAVING. I CALLED THE BUICK 1-800 NUMBER TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE RECALL AND THE REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT MY PARTICULAR VIN# WAS NOT ON THAT RECALL LIST BUT I COULD TAKE IT TO A DEALERSHIP FOR A DIAGNOSIS AND FOR REPAIRS AT MY EXPENSE. I EXPLAINED TO HER THAT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY IF MY CAR IS HAVING THE EXACT SAME ISSUES AS THE RECALL IS STATING WHY WOULD MY CAR NOT BE UNDER THE RECALL NOTICE. SHE STATED THAT IT WAS PROBABLY MANUFACTURED AT A DIFFERENT PLANT AND NOT AT THE PLANT WHICH RECALLS WERE ISSUED. MY QUESTION IS \"IF I AM HAVING THE SAME EXACT ISSUES AS DESCRIBED IN THE RECALL FOR THE 2011 BUICK LACROSSE MODELS THAN WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE THE PROBLEM DIAGNOSED AND FIXED?\" I BELIEVE THAT BUICK SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND CONTACT A DEALERSHIP TO HAVE MY CAR DIAGNOSED AND THEN IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT THIS IS THE SAME PROBLEM AS THE RECALL THEY SHOULD PAY FOR THOSE REPAIRS AS WELL.  THIS HAS BEEN AN ON-GOING ISSUE SINCE I PURCHASED THE CAR (USED) IN OCTOBER 2014",
