THE DOT ABOVE THE 'D' (FOR DRIVE) STARTED FLASHING, AND A MESSAGE FLASHED: 'SHIFT TO P TO START.' WE CAME TO A STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. I PUT IT IN PARK AND THEN WAS ABLE TO TURN IT BACK ON. I HAD BOTH HANDS ON THE WHEEL, SO I NEVER TOUCHED THE STARTER BUTTON. THE KEY FOB WAS IN MY PURSE, WHICH WAS NOT MOVED. THANKFULLY WE WERE NOT ON A HIGHWAY, SO NOBODY RAN INTO US. I DROPPED IT OFF AT THE DEALERSHIP THIS MORNING, AND THEY JUST TOLD ME THEY CANNOT RECREATE THE ERROR. WE'VE HAD IT FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS, AND WE'VE DRIVEN IT 1500 MILES, MOSTLY HIGHWAY.....UPDATED 11/03/17 *BF  UPDATED 11/09/2017*JS",
