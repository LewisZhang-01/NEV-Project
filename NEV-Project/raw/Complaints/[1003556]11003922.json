WHEN OD LIGHT STARTED BLINKING AUTOZONE TOLD ME THAT SOLENOIDS/TRANSMISSION WERE SHOT. AFTER REPLACING THE SOLENOIDS AS WELL AS THE TRANSMISSION ITSELF WITH AN IDENTICAL TRANSMISSION FROM AN IDENTICAL VEHICLE, IT IS APPARENT THAT THESE TRANSMISSIONS ARE INDEED FAULTY. IT IS STILL SLIPPING AND SLAMMING INTO GEAR. OVERDRIVE RARELY FUNCTIONS PROPERLY AND TENDS TO SHUT ITSELF OFF.",
