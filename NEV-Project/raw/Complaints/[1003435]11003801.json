TOTAL BRAKE FAILURE WITH NO WARNING. THE TRUCK HAS 29,000 MILES AND WAS SERVICED WITHIN LAST 2 MONTHS. THIS COULD HAVE VERY BAD AND HAD TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES. I FORTUNATELY WAS ABLE TO DOWN SHIFT USING THE MANUAL SHIFT FEATURE AND SLOW DOWN AND STOP SAFELY. THIS IS A SERIOUS ISSUE. MY FAMILY AND I COULD HAVE BEEN IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT AND HURT OURSELVES OR OTHERS. FORD NEEDS TO GET THIS FIGURED OUT ASAP. CALL ME WITH ANY QUESTIONS.",
