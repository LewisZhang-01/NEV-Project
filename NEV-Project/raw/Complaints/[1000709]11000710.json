EXTREMELY SCARY SITUATION ESPECIALLY SINCE IT STARTED SUDDENLY, WITHOUT WARNING WHILE DRIVING AND THE BRAKES DID NOT WORK AT ALL DURING THE FIRST INCIDENT.  THE WARNING LIGHTS DID NOT COME ON AND LUCKILY WE WERE NOT YET ON THE EXPRESSWAY. WE MADE IT HOME AND HAD IT TOWED TO THE REPAIR SHOP THE NEXT DAY.  WE DROVE IT AROUND THE PARKING LOT WITH THE MECHANIC AND THE BRAKES FAILED AGAIN. WE HAD TO HAVE THE ABS BRAKE SYSTEM (ABS PUMP/MODULE ASSEMBLY) REPLACED AT A COST OF $2,263. WE CONTACTED TOYOTA WHO SAID THEY COULD NOT REIMBURSE FOR THE ISSUE.  WE HAVE READ ONLINE THAT OTHER ISSUES HAVE HAPPENED TO CONSUMERS AND IT SEEMS THAT ANYTHING THAT RESULTS IN TOTAL BRAKE FAILURE SHOULD WARRANTY A RECALL.  PLEASE ADVISE IF YOU ARE ABLE TO CONSIDER THIS SITUATION AND IF YOU NEED ANY FURTHER INFORMATION.    SINCERELY,  [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
