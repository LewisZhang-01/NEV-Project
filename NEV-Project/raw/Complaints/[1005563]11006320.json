WHEN KEY IS REMOVED FROM THE CAR AND THE DOOR OPENS, CAR CHIMES LIKE THE KEY IS STILL IN THE IGNITION, AND AM UNABLE TO LOCK THE DOORS WITH THE BUTTON FROM THE INSIDE. I MUST PUSH EACH DOOR LOCK DOWN, AND THERE IS NO WAY TO LOCK MY TRUNK. THIS POSES A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN, ESPECIALLY IF BEING FOLLOWED AND NOW BEING ABLE TO ENTER MY CAR IN A FAST MANNER AND LOCK THE DOORS WITH ONE SWITCH.  PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN JULY OF 2010. REPLACED ONCE ON DECEMBER 6, 2013. NOW HAVE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT TO HAVE IT REPLACED AGAIN ON JULY 25, 2017.",
