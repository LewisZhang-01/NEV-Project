        "summary": "I AM EXPERIENCING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM WITH MY 2013 FORD F-150 XLT AS THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN RECALLED IN THE 2011 AND 2012 MODELS. MY TRUCK WAS ALSO BUILT IN DEARBORN, MICHIGAN AND HAS THE 6R80 TRANSMISSION. I TOOK MY TRUCK INTO THE DEALERSHIP THIS WEEK TO FIND THAT THE LEAD FRAME NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THE DEALER IS REPLACING THE POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE SOFTWARE AND THE LEAD FRAME AT MY COST OF  $1,362 .    THE PROBLEM: A PROBLEM WITH THE OUTPUT SPEED SENSOR ON THE VEHICLE'S TRANSMISSION LEAD FRAME COULD CAUSE THE TRANSMISSION CONTROLS TO FORCE A TEMPORARY DOWNSHIFT INTO 1ST GEAR. DEPENDING ON THE SPEED OF THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME OF THE DOWNSHIFT, THE DRIVER COULD EXPERIENCE AN ABRUPT SPEED REDUCTION THAT COULD CAUSE THE REAR TIRES TO SLIDE OR LOCK UP, RESULTING IN LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL AND INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH.   EARLIER THIS WEEK ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, MY TRUCK WILL NOT SHIFT OUT OF FIRST GEAR AFTER COMING TO A STOP. I WAS NEARLY INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT DUE TO THIS PROBLEM WHEN I WAS UNABLE TO ACCELERATE FROM A STOP LIGHT AND THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR ME TO PULL OVER. THE PROBLEM ONLY CORRECTS ITSELF WHEN I SHUT THE ENGINE OFF AND RESTART IT.",
