FINALLY GOT THAT ISSUE FIXED. A FEW MONTHS LATER THE WASHER FLUID STOPPED WORKING. I TOOK IT IN TO HAVE IT LOOKED  AT AND THEY SAID IT HAD A HOLE IN IT. I HAD IT REPLACED. A FEW MONTHS LATER MY ENGINE STARTS MAKING A REALLY LOUD NOISE WHEN ACCELERATING AND MY STEERING WHEEL WOULD GET SO TIGHT WHEN I TURNED IT, THAT I COULDN'T TURN. I TOOK IT TO BE LOOKED AT AND WAS TOLD IT HAD A HOLE IN THE STEERING PUMP AND A PIN NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AS WELL AS THE PUMP. I HAD THAT REPLACED. A FEW WEEKS LATER I'M GETTING  GAS AND TRY TO START MY CAR AND IT STALLS. I TRY TO START IT AGAIN AND IT STARTS, BUT IT ACTS LIKE IT WANTS TO DIE. THE FUEL GAUGE NEEDLE STAYS ON E, EVEN THOUGH I JUST FILLED MY TANK UP. THIS SAME ISSUE HAS HAPPENED 3 TIMES NOW AFTER GETTING GAS. MY STEERING HAS STARTING MAKING A SQUEAKING NOISE WHEN I TURN IT. MY ENGINE IS SO LOUD WHEN I'M DRIVING, IT'S DEFINITELY NOT A NORMAL SOUND. WHEN MY CAR SITS IN PARK WITH THE ENGINE IN YOU CAN HEAR THE ENGINE WHISTLING AND REVVING UP ON ITS OWN, AND THEN IT ACTS AS THOUGH IT WANTS TO DIE.",
