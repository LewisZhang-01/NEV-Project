        "summary": "TAKATA RECALL:  IN JULY 2016 I RECEIVED NOTICE FROM TOYOTA OF PASSENGER AIR BAG RECALL & TOLD NO ONE CAN RIDE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.  I HAVE A DISABLED DAUGHTER WHO CANNOT SIT IN THE BACK.  I CALLED TOYOTA CORP AND THEY ARRANGED WITH THE LOCAL DEALER TO PROVIDE ME WITH A RENTAL CAR.  MY CAR HAS BEEN SITTING OUTSIDE IN THE DESERT HEAT, BLOWING SAND AND SUN FOR A YEAR NOW.  IN DECEMBER 2016 THE DEALER REFUSED TO PAY THE RENTAL BILL OF $1085 AND MY CREDIT CARD WAS CHARGED.  I FOUGHT FOR A MONTH AND A HALF WITH THE DEALER, THE RENTAL COMPANY AND TOYOTA CORP AND FINALLY RECEIVED A CHECK FOR $1085.  THE JANUARY 2017 BILL WAS PAID BUT NONE SINCE AND I NOW HAVE ANOTHER $1085 ON MY CREDIT CARD AND THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER FOUR MONTHS OF CHARGES.  THE DEALER REPRESENTATIVES REFUSE TO RETURN MY CALLS OR OFFER ANY EXPLANATION OTHER THAN THEY NEVER GOT THE BILLS.  I FAXED THE BILLS TO THEM AND THE MGR. OF ENTERPRISE RENTAL WENT TO SEE THEM PERSONALLY - TO NO AVAIL.  TOYOTA CORP SAYS THEY CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT THE DEALER NOT PAYING.  THERE IS NO PLAN FOR WHEN MY CAR WILL BE FIXED NOR WHAT KIND OF CONDITION IT WILL BE IN WHEN AND IF I EVER GET IT BACK.  PLEASE ADVISE IF I HAVE ANY OPTIONS.  I AM 84 YEARS OLD, AND CAREGIVER FOR A DISABLED DAUGHTER WHO NEEDS TO TRAVEL 100 MILES AWAY ONCE OR TWICE A MONTH FOR MEDICAL ATTENTION.  WE BOTH NEED WALKERS, SO I NEED A CAR THAT I CAN LOAD AND UNLOAD ON THESE TRIPS.  THE RENTAL CAR IS PERFECT, BUT I CANNOT AFFORD $1085 A MONTH WHEN THE DEALER HAD AGREED TO THIS ARRANGEMENT.",
