AS SOON AS I GET A JUMP AND BRING IT TO HAVE IT CHECKED THE MECHANIC STATES NOTHING IS WRONG WITH THE ALTERNATOR OR THE BATTERY. NO CODES POP UP AS ANYTHING  IS WRONG.   I'VE BEEN IN A LIFE THREATENING SITUATION WHERE MY CAR STALLED WHILE I WAS DRIVING ON A MAIN ROAD. THE ONLY WAY I COULD GET THE CAR TO WORK WAS TO TURN IT OFF AND START IT AGAIN. THEN IT WAS FINE. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THEY HAVEN'T HEARD OF ANYTHING AS FAR AS RECALLS. THAT HAS HAPPENED AT LEAST 3 TIMES. ANOTHER PROBLEM THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED WAS THE CAR ACCELERATING ON ITS ON. I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY WERE NOT CONCERNED.  AND ANOTHER PROBLEM IS MY PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW ALL OF A SUDDEN WOULD GET STUCK. IVE HAD PROBLEMS FROM DAY ONE AND THE DEALERSHIP ACTS LIKE IT IS NO CONCERN. AS I READ MAJORITY OF COMPLAIN IS FALLING TO ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS, ESPECIALLY WITH THE TIPM BUT NOTHING IS GETTING DONE ABOUT IT. I CONSTANTLY CHECK THIS SITE TO SEE IF THE GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS BY FORCING MORE RECALLS ON ELECTRICAL OR TIPM BOARDS, BUT THEY ARE NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT. WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE, MANY LIVES TAKEN AWAY OVER IT????",
