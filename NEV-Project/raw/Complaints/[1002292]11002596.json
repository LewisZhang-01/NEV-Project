I HAD TO SWITCH TO THE NUMBER 2 ON MY COLUMN JUST TO GET IT TO DRIVE.  THEN, MY AIR BAG LIGHT, ABS LIGHT, HAZARD LIGHTS, ENGINE LIGHT, BATTERY LIGHT, AND PROBABLY MULTIPLE OTHERS CAME ON.  MY SPEEDOMETER WENT CRAZY AND SAID I WAS DRIVING AT 0 MPH.  MY CAR STARTING SHAKING LIKE IT WAS GOING TO SHUT OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.  LUCKILY, I WAS ABLE TO GET IT INTO A PARKING LOT WHERE IT SHUT OFF AND COMPLETELY DIED.  IT SOUNDED LIKE A CLICKING BUT WOULD NOT START WHEN TURNING THE KEY.  I AM VERY LUCKY THAT I DID NOT GET STUCK IN THE ROAD WHEN IT STARTED TO DIE AND GET T-BONED.  THIS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BEFORE IT CAUSES SOMEONE TO CRASH.",
