IT WILL HAPPEN MOST OFTEN WHEN I BEGIN TO ACCELERATE TO MERGE ONTO A HIGHWAY TO GET TO TRAFFIC SPEEDS.   IN THIS CASE, THE ENGINE WILL QUIT AND THE CAR WILL IMMEDIATELY SLOW.  IF THERE IS A CAR BEHIND ME, THERE IS NO INDICATION TO THAT CAR THAT I AM IMMEDIATELY SLOWING.  VERY DANGEROUS! THIS ALSO HAPPENS WHILE I'M TRAVELLING AT HIGHWAY SPEED AND THE ENGINE JUST QUITS AND THEN RESTARTS ON ITS OWN.  I HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED THIS WHEN I SLOW TO STOP AT A STOP SIGN OR STOP LIGHT.  THE ENGINE WILL SIMPLY DIE AND MUST BE RE-STARTED.",
