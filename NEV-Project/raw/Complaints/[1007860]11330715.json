IT HAS HAPPENED TWICE FOR ME, WHERE I MOVED MY CAR OUT OF A PARKING SPOT, EXITED THE VEHICLE TO CHECK SOMETHING, THEN THE CAR WAS TOTALLY UNRESPONSIVE AFTER GETTING BACK IN.  IT TOOK ME UPWARDS OF 5 MINUTES TO GET THE VEHICLE STARTED AND OUT OF PARK AND INTO DRIVE.  LUCKILY, I WAS IN A LOW-TRAFFIC PARKING LOT, BUT IF THIS WAS A BUSY AREA IT COULD HAVE CAUSED A MAJOR ISSUE.  THE CENTER DISPLAY HAS BEEN REPLACED IN THIS VEHICLE BEFORE AS WELL.  I AM AFRAID THAT MY CAR IS APPROACHING THE INEVITABLE EMMC FAILURE WHERE THE FLASH MEMORY WEARS OUT AFTER TOO MANY WRITE OPERATIONS.  *TR",
