THE SHIFT IN THE TIRE LOCATION OCCURRED WHILE ACCELERATING NORMALLY FROM A STOP ON A VILLAGE ROADWAY, GOING STRAIGHT IN TRAFFIC.     I BELIEVE THIS VEHICLE WAS MANUFACTURED WITH SUBSTANDARD STEEL AS HYUNDAI AS SINCE IMPROVED THE STEEL USED IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS ON THIS MODEL.  I FILED A PREVIOUS COMPLAINT REGARDING THE REAR SUBFRAME WHICH WAS REPLACED ON THE SAME VEHICLE.",
