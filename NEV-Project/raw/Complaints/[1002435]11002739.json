        "summary": "I AM WRITING TO REPORT A DEFECT AND SAFETY CONCERN ABOUT MY 2016 TOYOTA CAMRY.  LAST JULY I BOUGHT A 2016 TOYOTA CAMRY (VIN:[XXX]) FROM TOYOTA OF SARASOTA (7435 S TAMIAMI TRAIL SARASOTA, FL 34231). LAST NOVEMBER, WHEN I WAS DRIVING THIS CAR ON I75, THE ENGINE SHUT OFF SUDDENLY AND THE DASHBOARD WAS DEAD AS WELL . I WAS SO SCARED AND PULLED THE CAR OVER TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD. WHEN I CALMED DOWN , I TRIED TO RESTART THE ENGINE, AND IT WORKED AGAIN. I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST BECAUSE IT WAS A NEW CAR AND DID NOT REPORT THIS TO THE DEALER IMMEDIATELY.  WHEN MY FIRST SCHEDULED SERVICE VISIT ON JANUARY THIS YEAR, I TOLD THE DEALER WHAT HAPPENED IN NOVEMBER AND ASKED THEM TO CHECK THE CAR CAREFULLY AND THOROUGHLY. THEY TOLD ME THEY DID NOT HEAR OF THE THING I TOLD THEM EVER HAPPENED ON CAMRY BEFORE AND AGREE TO TAKE A LOOK. THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH MY CAR. BUT TWO WEEKS LATER, THE ENGINE SHUT OFF AGAIN WHEN I DRIVING THE CAR ON HIGHWAY I75. THE SAME THING HAPPENED AGAIN. I CALLED TOYOTA THOUGH THE NUMBER 800-331-4331, AND THEY SAID THEY DID NOT HAVE THE SIMILAR CASE REPORTED AND SUGGESTED ME TO CHECK MY CAR AT THE DEALER. I STOPPED BY THE DEALER AND THEY DROVE MY CAR ON THE HIGHWAY TRYING TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM BUT FAILED. THEY ALSO CHECK THE CAR THOROUGHLY AND FOUND NOTHING UNNORMAL. YESTERDAY(7/2/2017), I WENT THE  DEALER FOR MY SECOND SCHEDULED SERVICE VISIT AND EVERYTHING WAS GOOD FOR MY CAR. BUT WHEN I WAS DRIVING HOME ON I75, THE ENGINE STOPPED WORKING AGAIN. I RESTARTED THE CAR AND DROVE BACK TO THE DEALER REPORTING THEM THE PROBLEM. THEY CHECK THE CAR AGAIN AND FOUND NOTHING WRONG AGAIN. ENCLOSED PLEASE FIND THE PICTURES I TOOK YESTERDAY WHEN I PULLED OVER MY CAR ON THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD. THE DASHBOARD WAS DEAD AND THE KEY WAS STILL AT THE ON POSITION. PLEASE HELP ME TO FIX THIS PROBLEM, WHICH IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN.    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
