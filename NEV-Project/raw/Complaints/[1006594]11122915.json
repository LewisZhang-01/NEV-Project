WHILE TOWING A 15,000LB FIFTH WHEEL TRAILER TRAVELING AT 65MPG ON THE NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE, I FELT A VIBRATION AND IMMEDIATLEY PULLED TO THE SHOULDER. I FOUND THAT 6 OUT OF 8 LUGS SHEARED OFF THE PASSENGER SIDE DUALLY, LEAVING TWO LUGS HOLDING THE DUALLY WHEELS ON. THIS IS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR ME AND FEEL A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE. IF I DID NOT PULL OVER THE WHEELS WOULD HAVE FALLEN OFF AND A CATASTROPHIC CRASH WOULD HAVE OCCURED. I WOULD LIKE THE LUGS  EXAMINED BY A FORENSIC EXAMINER TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE, I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF WHY THIS EVENT HAPPENED AND AM CONCERNED ABOUT A REOCCURANCE. MY WIFE AND I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. THIS TRUCK IS MADE TO TOW 30,000LBS ABD I WAS TOWING ONLY 15,000 LBS. TRUCK IS CURRENTLY AT CHAPMAN DODGE OF HORSHAM P.A. *TT  UPDATED 10/9/18 *JB",
