        "summary": "PURCHASED VEHICLE USED IN 2013 WITH 28K MILES.  STARTED NOTICING AN ENGINE KNOCK IN 2016, IN BETWEEN OIL CHANGES, @ APPRX. 85K MILES.  BEGAN HAVING TO ADD 3-4 QUARTS OF OIL EVERY 1000 MILES, GIVE OR TAKE.  CALLED DEALERSHIP FOR SERVICE - WHILE WARRANTY WAS STILL IN EFFECT - AND WAS TOLD IT WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THIS ENGINE, AND ADDING OIL WAS ALL THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE.  WHILE DEALING WITH THAT, HAD TO REPLACE THE SENSOR, AS VEHICLE STALLED WHILE IN A LEFT TURN LANE, WHICH ALMOST CAUSED ME TO BE REAR ENDED.  DECEMBER 2016 - OIL CONTINUED TO BE BURNED AT AN ALARMING RATE, SO MY HUSBAND CONTACTED A FRIEND WHO WORKS FOR A CHEVY DEALER.  WE WERE TOLD NOT ONLY IS THE MASSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION NOT NORMAL, BUT THAT GM IS FULLY AWARE OF THE PROBLEM, BUT REFUSING TO ISSUE A RECALL OR PAY TO HAVE THE PISTONS REPLACED!  2017 - HAVE CONTINUED TO ADD 2-4 QUARTS OF OIL EVERY 1000 MILES OR SO; THEN MAY 2017, RECEIVED NOTICE FROM GM ACKNOWLEDGING THE PISTON RING WEAR/EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION, BUT THAT IT'S ONLY REPAIRABLE WITHIN 7 YEARS 6 MONTHS OF ORIGINAL IN-SERVICE DATE, OR 120,000 MILES, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST!  SERIOUSLY?!  I AM PAST BOTH & AM PISSED OFF!  GM HAS KNOWN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FOR YEARS, AND NEEDS TO TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY, NOT IMPOSE A YEAR/MILEAGE CAP!  I WONDER IF A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT WOULD WAKE THEM UP?  I'M NOT OPPOSED TO LOOKING INTO IT!  DON'T GET ME WRONG - PREVIOUS TO MY EQUINOX, I OWNED AN HHR FOR 11 YEARS, AND PRIOR TO THAT, A SUBURBAN FOR 5 YEARS.  I LIKE MY CHEVY'S BUT THIS ISSUE HAS LEFT A BAD TASTE FOR THEM, AND AM TOTALLY UNIMPRESSED WITH THEIR LACK OF CONCERN REGARDING THIS ISSUE.  FOR THOSE OF US THAT ARE PAST THE VERY CONVENIENT YEARS/MILES, THIS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE OUT OF POCKET REPAIR.  I CAN'T EVEN TRADE IT IN, AS I STILL OWE ON THE [XXX] LOAN!!    STEP UP GM, & DO THE RIGHT THING!  BY THE WAY - HUBBY IS REPLACING THE TIMING CHAIN TODAY :O[    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6). *JS *TR",
