        "summary": "I bought my 2018 Subaru Forester in may of 2020 it is now January of 2022 and I have replaced the entire windshield THREE TIMES. If requested, my vehicle can be inspected. It is clear that this windshield is too fragile and poses a safety risk for myself and those passengers that enter my vehicle. It is also costing me a lot of money to repair multiple windshields and causing my insurance to go up for something out of my control. I can only imagine what would happen if I were ever to get into an accident with the windshield being that fragile. I am not a dangerous driver nor have I ever been in an accident, I have a clean record. A class action lawsuit filed in 2017 stating that  \u201cThe cracks were allegedly due to the deicer creating a condition that makes the glass susceptible to cracking after a minor strike to the glass, such as the stone's impact\u201c it also stated that the lawsuit included 2.5 million Subaru models between the years of 2017-2020.  \u201c[XXX], represented by Attorneys [XXX] Law Group, Moon Law APC, and [XXX], contends the Subaru models have \"defective and dangerous\" windshields that are prone to \"cracking, chipping and otherwise breaking.\"\u201d After the first windshield crack in June of 2020 (1 month after I purchased the vehicle) I called my authorized Subaru dealership and asked if there was a common problem or known safety issue with the windshields, I was told there was not and my issue was singular.   This is a SEVERE safety concern. A minor crack went through both panes of the windshield and rapidly become in my line of vision.   I feel as though this is an unfair and unjust safety concern that is costing Subaru drivers like myself their safety and money.
