THERE IS A SAFETY RECALL THAT INCLUDES 'CERTAIN' 2011 THRU 2014 CHRYSLER 300'S (\"P60 / NHTSA 14V-634...FCA HAS DECIDED THAT A DEFECT, WHICH RELATES TO MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY, EXISTS IN CERTAIN 2011 THROUGH 2014 MODEL YEAR DODGE DURANGO, CHRYSLER 300, DODGE CHALLENGER, DODGE CHARGER AND 2012 THROUGH 2014 MODEL YEAR JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH A 3.6L ENGINE AND A 160 AMP ALTERNATOR.\") I CHECKED WITH MY LOCAL CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP AND THE NHTSA VIN RECALL LOOK-UP TOOL AND MY CAR HAS NO OPEN RECALLS.  HOWEVER, I DO NOT FIND IT A COINCIDENCE THAT MY CAR HAS THIS PROBLEM IF OTHER CHRYSLER 300'S ARE HAVING THE PROBLEM ENOUGH TO GENERATE A RECALL. I HAD THE BATTERY AND ALTERNATOR REPLACED AT A LOCAL REPAIR COMPANY FOR $962 AND SOME CHANGE. AS THE SAFETY RECALL WARNS AND DENOTES THE POSSIBILITY OF ... \"THE DRIVER WILL HAVE LIMITED OR NO DETECTION OF THE ALTERNATOR FAILING, WHICH CAN RESULT IN VEHICLE SHUTDOWN WHILE DRIVING\" ... THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO ME AT AN INTERSECTION IN HEAVY TRAFFIC ON 06/29/17.  I THINK MY VIN SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE SAFETY RECALL AND CHRYSLER SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REPAIRS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.",
