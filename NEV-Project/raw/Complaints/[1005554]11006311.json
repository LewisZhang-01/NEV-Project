IT WILL RESTART AFTER A COUPLE ATTEMPTS. THIS HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF A COUPLE DAYS.  THE CAR IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY, BUT A DEALERSHIP WON'T BE ABLE TO FIT IT IN FOR TWO WEEKS. I HAVE APPEALED TO CHRYSLER IN TWO SEPARATE PHONE CALLS, BUT THEY HAVE BEEN UNHELPFUL AND WILL NOT AGREE TO REIMBURSE COSTS IF I GO ELSEWHERE.",
