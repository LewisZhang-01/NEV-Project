        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 2017 CHEVY MALIBU LAST WEEK.  I WAS LOOKING OVER THE DATA ON THE CHEVY WEBSITE.  CHEVY IS LISTING TWO DIFFERENT HP RATINGS FOR THIS CAR.  ONE AREA STATES 163HP & 184 LB-FT TORQUE.  THE OTHER SAYS 160HP & 184 LB-FT TORQUE.  THE MAIN ISSUE I HAVE IS WITH THE TRANSMISSION.  GM SAYS THE CAR COMES WITH A 6T45 TRANSMISSION. THAT TRANSMISSION IS RATED AT 215HP & 232 LB-FT TORQUE.  ENOUGH FOR THE RATED ENGINE.  THE TRANSMISSION IN THE CAR IS A 6T40.  RATED AT 180HP & 177 LB-FT TORQUE.  THE TORQUE ON THE MOTOR IS 184 LB-FT AT 2500 RPM TO 3000 RPM.  I WORK AND LIVE IN PHOENIX, AZ.  95% OF DRIVING IS CITY DRIVING.  I AM PAST THE MAX OF THE TRANSMISSION MOST OF THE TIME.  THIS TRANSMISSION WILL FAIL VERY FAST IN THIS HEAT.  PLUS THE EPA FUEL RATING I'M SURE WAS CALCULATED WITH THE TRANSMISSION ADVERTISED BY GM NOT IN THE CAR.  I OWN A CAR THAT IS NOT AT ALL WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS.",
