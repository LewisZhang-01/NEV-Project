        "summary": "Transmission intermittently goes into neutral while driving causing engine rev, loss of ability to continue to drive/maintain speed.  Very dangerous as you have to drift to the side of the road and put the transmission into Park and back to Drive to get it to engage again.  Meanwhile you could easily be struck by another car trying due to sudden loss of momentum with no brake light warning or trying to maneuver to the side of the road with no engine power.  Occurs every month or two.  Dealer unable to duplicate multiple times.  No warnings before it happens. There are at least 20 other reports of this on the NHTSA site.  When will an investigation be opened?  This has the potential to cause a serious crash.",
