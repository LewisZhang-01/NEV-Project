THE CAR WOULD SLOW DOWN WHEN I HIT THE PEDAL BUT IN ORDER TO STOP THE CAR I HAD TO NEARLY PRESS THE BRAKE PEDAL TO THE FLOOR. LATER IN THE SAME DRIVE THE BRAKES FUNCTIONED NORMALLY. I DIDN'T NOTICE ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES FOR AT LEAST A WEEK UNTIL MY DAUGHTER DROVE THE CAR AND NEARLY HIT SOMEONE BECAUSE THE BRAKES DID NOT STOP AS SHE EXPECTED. I NOTICED THAT IF I PUMPED THE BRAKE PEDAL THE PRESSURE WOULD RETURN FOR A WHILE BUT THEN IT WOULD GO SOFT AGAIN ONCE I DROVE IT AND THE PEDAL IS PRESSED. AT THE POINT THE PRESSURE WOULD NOT RETURN CONSISTENTLY AND IT WAS QUESTIONABLE IF THE CAR WOULD STOP I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT INFORMED ME THAT THE ABS MODULE HAS FAILED AND THAT IT WOULD BE A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE MY BRAKES WOULD TOTALLY FAIL. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF THE ABS MODULE FAILING. NO ABS LIGHT; NO BRAKE LIGHT; NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT. FOR THIS TO AFFECT THE SAFETY SYSTEM OF THE CAR I WOULD EXPECT THERE TO BE SOME TYPE OF INDICATION OF FAILURE. THE DEALER INFORMED ME THAT THE MODULE IS $2200 FOR REPLACEMENT! THE CAR IS ONLY 5 YEARS OLD WHY WOULD THE ABS MODULE FAIL IN SUCH A RELATIVELY NEW VEHICLE?",
