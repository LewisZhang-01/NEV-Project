THIS HAPPENS IF THE VEHICLE IS STATIONARY WHEN THE ENGINE IS TURNED ON AND SOMETIMES WILL HAPPEN RANDOMLY WHOLE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION. OFTEN THIS WILL HAPPEN AS I AM IN THE PROCESS OF BRAKING TO PARK AND TURN THE VEHICLE OFF. THIS HAPPENS AT VARIOUS SPEEDS, BUT MOST OFTEN AT LOWER LEVEL SPEEDS IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS.",
