DEALER SERVICE PEOPLE SAY THE WAY TO CORRECT THE FAILURE IS TO OPEN AND CLOSE THE DRIVER'S DOOR.  THE SYSTEM THEN REBOOTS AND USUALLY WORKS OK THEREAFTER -- USUALLY.  TODAY THE CAR WAS PARKED, SHE ENTERED, AND THE KEY FOB FAILED TO WORK.  SHE HAD TO OPEN AND CLOSE THE DRIVER'S DOOR 4 TIMES BEFORE IT DID WORK.  THIS IS A SAFETY PROBLEM WHEN SHE IS FREQUENTLY THE LAST PERSON OUT OF THE LOT AT WORK, AND SHE MUST OPEN AND CLOSE HER DOOR BEFORE THE CAR WILL START AND THE PHONE BLUE-TOOTH WILL WORK.  THE DEALER PLEADS IGNORANCE EVEN THOUGH HIS SERVICE PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS.  CAR IS PARKED IN MODERN GARAGE OR OUTDOORS.",
