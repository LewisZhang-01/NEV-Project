        "summary": "2013 NISSAN SENTRA TRANSMISSION FAILED AT 78,600 MILES WITHOUT ANY WARNING WHILE WE WERE TRAVELING ON A BUSY HIGHWAY ON THE WAY HOME FROM A LONG ROAD TRIP. WHILE DRIVING AT AN SPEED OF APPROXIMATELY 70-75 MPH IN TN ON THE HIGHWAY THE VEHICLE BEGAN DECELERATE AND THE RPM'S JUST KEPT REVVING UP. IT WAS JUST ME (A FEMALE) AND MY TWO YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IN THE VEHICLE. I ATTEMPTED TO THE EMERGENCY SHOULDER WITH MY HAZARDS ON TRYING TO AVOID BEING HIT BY A TRANSFER TRUCK AND SEVERAL VEHICLES. I SHUT THE CAR OFF TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON AND WAS AFRAID OF WHAT JUST OCCURRED. I STARTED THE ENGINE BACK AND IT BEGAN DRIVING FINE FOR ABOUT 10 MINS ON THE HIGHWAY AND THEN IT DECELERATED AGAIN NEAR THE ATLANTA AREA AND TOTALLY DRIVING POWER. I WAS 3 HOURS FROM HOME AND HAD TO CALL FOR HELP. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE DEALERSHIP THE NEXT MORNING AND ADVISED THEM OF THE ISSUE AND ENGINE CODES RECEIVED FROM AN AUTO STORE. I THEN CONTACTED NISSAN CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO NOTIFY THEM OF THE TRANSMISSION FAILURE AND THEY ADVISED TO SIMPLY TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR SINCE IT WAS OUTSIDE OF WARRANTY. THE DEALERSHIP QUOTED US A PRICE OF $3600 BEFORE TAXES AND ADVISED THAT THEY HAVE SEVERAL ISSUES WITH CVT TRANSMISSIONS BUT THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THEM. I HAVE CONCERNS THAT THIS IS A POTENTIAL SAFETY HAZARD WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AFTER REVIEW AND IN DEPTH RESEARCH OF THE FAULTY TRANSMISSION ISSUES SEVERAL NISSAN OWNERS HAVE FACED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ISSUE IS CAUSING HARDSHIP ON CUSTOMERS THAT RELY ON THE BRAND AND SAFETY FEATURES NISSAN IS CONTINUING TO ADVERTISE.    NISSANS COMMITMENT:  DEAR NISSAN SENTRA OWNER:  NISSAN IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF PRODUCT SAFETY, QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.   (STATEMENT IS NULL AND VOID PER THIS CONCERNED CUSTOMER)",
