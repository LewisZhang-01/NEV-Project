I GET TO A RED LIGHT AND AS I'M ABOUT TO TAKE OFF, IT SHUTS OFF. I PLACED IT IN PARK AND RESTARTED IT THEN IT SPUTTERS AND THEN CATCHES. A FEW MINUTES LATER THIS ERROR MESSAGE COMES UP ON THE DASH WITH A WRENCH. I TOOK IT TO THE NEAREST AUTO STORE, THEY PLACED IT ON THE MACHINE AND SAID IT LOOKS LIKE MY ENGINE WIRING HARNESS OR ECM/PCM. I HAD THE HARNESS REPLACED (ALMOST $900) AND A WEEK LATER THE WRENCH ERROR MESSAGE RETURNED AND THE PROBLEM HAS RETURNED AS WELL.",
