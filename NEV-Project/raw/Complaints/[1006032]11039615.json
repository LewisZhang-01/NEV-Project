        "summary": "TAKATA RECALL - MY 2007 MUSTANG WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE DEALER AND FORD MOTOR CO OVER A YEAR AGO NEEDING BOTH DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAGS REPLACED UNDER THE TAKATA RECALL. I WAS ASKED TO BRING IT INTO THE SHOP LAST SPRING 2016 AND WAS INFORMED THEY HAD PARTS FOR THE DRIVERS SIDE ONLY AND WOULD BE CONTACTED WHEN PASSENGER SIDE PARTS WERE AVAILABLE. I HAVE RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP ON AVERAGE ABOUT EVERY THREE MONTHS CHECKING FOR THE PARTS FOR THE PASSENGER SIDE. AS OF TODAY 10-25-17 I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE ADDITIONAL AIRBAG PARTS NEEDED TO CORRECT THE FAULTY PARTS. THIS HAS BECOME VERY INCONVENIENT BECAUSE KNOW THE AIRBAG IS UNDER RECALL AND HAS PROBLEMS HAS INSTILLED A DEGREE OF FEAR IN BOTH MY WIFE AND I. MY WIFE HAS NOT WANTED TO RIDE IN THE CAR WITH A FAULTY AIRBAG ON HER SIDE OF THE CAR, WHICH I REALLY CAN'T BLAME HER. MY LAST VISIT TO THE DEALERSHIP RESULTED IN MY ASKING FOR THE FORD PARTS AND SERVICE MANAGERS INFORMATION WHICH I WAS DENIED, I ASKED TO SPEAK WITH THE DEALERSHIP GENERAL MANAGER AT AUTONATION FORD, 6850 HWY 121, FRISCO TX 75034, 972-335-5014, WHO NEVER ANSWERS HIS PHONE NOR RETURNS ANY PHONE MESSAGES. THIS IS VERY UNFORTUNATE FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED BUT MAINLY THE CUSTOMER WHO IS TECHNICALLY DRIVING A TIMEBOMB. MY WIFE IS REFUSING TO RIDE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT IN THE CAR FOR FEAR OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF WE WERE INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT, THE DEALERSHIP WON'T TALK ABOUT IT AND FORD HAS INSTRUCTED THE DEALERSHIPS NOT TO SHARE THEIR CONTACT INFO. OVER A ONE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME IS MORE THAN A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO GET A CORRECTED PART FOR THIS CAR.",
