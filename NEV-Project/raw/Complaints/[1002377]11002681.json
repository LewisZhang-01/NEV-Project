MY WIFE WAS DRIVING AND NOTICED WHEN TURNING RIGHT INTO A BUSINESS DRIVEWAY THAT A SQUEAL NOISE WAS HEARD FROM THE LEFT REAR WHEEL AREA. I INSPECTED THE UNDERCARRIAGE AND NOTICED THE WHEEL WAS TITED IN AT THE TOP AND THE TIRE WAS RUBBING THE INNER WHEEL WELL. WELL NOW LESS THAN 2 MONTHS LATER THE REAR AXLE IS BROKEN AND MY VAN IS NO LONGER SAFE TO DRIVE BECAUSE THE LEFT REAR WHEEL IS TILTED IN AT THE TOP AND THE TIRE RUBS THE INNER WHEEL WELL WHICH WILL RESULT IN A RAPID LOSS OF AIR PRESSURE AND LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL AND POSSIBLY A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. NOW IT APPEARS THAT I WILL HAVE TO PAY TO REPLACE THIS BROKEN AXLE SINCE FORD SEEMS TO HAVE WASHED THEIR HANDS OF THE PROBLEM DUE TO THE REQUIRED RECALLS HAVING BEEN COMPLETED.",
