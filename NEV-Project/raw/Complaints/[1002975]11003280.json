        "summary": "HAD TO REPLACE RACK & PINION STEERING AT 40,000 MILES.  DIFFICULT TO STEER ESPECIALLY TO THE LEFT.  ON ONE OCCASION WHEN EXITING A LEFT HAND CURVE THE VEHICLE DID NOT WANT TO TURN BACK TO THE RIGHT.  I HAVE GOOGLED THE PROBLEM AND HAVE LEARNED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS REPORTS OF SIMILAR PROBLEMS BUT DODGE HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL.  I WAS ADVISED THAT MINE WAS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY SO I HAD IT REPLACED VIA AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC.  I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FROM DODGE BUT THEY REFUSE.  AT TIMES WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS STOPPED OR MOVING SLOWLY, IT LITERALLY TOOK BOTH HANDS TO TURN THE STEERING WHEEL.  THE VEHICLE HAD 22,000 MILES WHEN I PURCHASED IT.  I THOUGHT THE STEERING WAS JUST \"STIFF\" BUT NOW I REALIZE THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING WHEN I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE.  I COULD NOT BELIEVE THE DIFFERENCE AFTER REPLACEMENT OF THE RACK & PINION.  I CAN NOW TURN THE WHEEL WITH ONE FINGER.  THIS APPEARS TO ME TO BE A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND QUESTION WHY DODGE HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL, PARTICULARLY WITH AS MANY CASES I ALONE HAVE FOUND OF SIMILAR PROBLEMS.",
