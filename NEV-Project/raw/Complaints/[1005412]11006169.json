        "summary": "THIS IS AN UPDATE ON WHAT I EXPERIENCE WITH MY 2013 HONDA ACCORD 7/4/2017. ON THIS DAY WHICH WAS INDEPENDENCE DAY MY EPS LOCKED UP WHILE LEAVING SOUTH CAROLINA HEADED BACK TO NORTH CAROLINE. I HAD TO HAVE MY CAR TOWED TO THE NEAREST HONDA DEALERSHIP TO EXAM THE CAR TO SEE WHY THE SYSTEM LOCKED UP. AS I RESEARCHED THE ISSUE I NOTICE SEVERAL ISSUE WITH THE EPS SYSTEM IN THIS YEAR MODEL. I READ THAT AN EXTENDED WARRANTY WAS GIVEN ON THE TORQUE SENSOR 5 YEAR. AS HONDA DIAGNOSED THE VEHICLE THEY DID THE UPDATE AND REPLACED THE TORQUE SENSOR, BUT THE PART THAT WOULD ALLOW THE SYSTEM TO WORK WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE EXTENDED WARRANTY AND THAT WAS THE CONTROL UNIT. I LOCATED ANOTHER ARTICLE AN IT ALSO HAD THAT HONDA WAS AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AS WELL, BUT EXTENDED THIS WARRANTY TO ONLY THE FIT AND CIVIC NOT THE ACCORDS. I WILL BE WRITING A LETTER TO THE CORPORATE OFFICE REGARDING THIS ISSUE AS WELL. I'M NOT SURE WHY THEY WOULD ONLY EXTEND IT TO THOSE TWO CARS WHEN ACCORD ARE THE NUMBER #1 SELLER. THIS WAS MY SECOND HONDA CAR AND OVER ALL MY FAMILY HAVE PURCHASED 4 HONDA CARS. THE COST FOR THE CONTROL UNIT WAS ALMOST $600.00 WHICH I REFUSED TO PAY AND HONDA SERVICE BROUGHT THE BALANCE TO $500.00 EVEN AS IF THEY WAS DOING ME A FAVOR. THE SERVICE MEMBER AND SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE AND RIGHT NOW AS A OWNER I'M NOT A SATISFIED CLIENT. IF EPS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WHY WAS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM EXTENDED UNDER WARRANTY. YOU KNOW WHY IT WASN'T EXTENDED BECAUSE THEY WANT THE CUSTOMER TO PAY FOR SOMETHING AT THE END OF THE DAY. I KNOW WE ALL LOOK FOR NEW IMPROVE WAYS TO MAKE TECHNOLOGY BETTER, BUT MAKING AN ELECTRIC POWER STEERING WAS NOT A BRIGHT IDEA IN MY OPTION. LUCKILY I WAS NOT DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY DOING 70 MILES AN HOUR AND THE STEERING LOCKED UP IT COULD HAVE BEEN FATAL FOR ME OR SOMEONE ELSE. TODAY I THINK MY OPTION ON PURCHASING A VEHICLE WITH HONDA WILL BE LAST ON THE LIST.",
