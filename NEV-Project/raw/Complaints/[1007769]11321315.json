        "summary": "THIS IS AN ELECTRIC KIA SOUL. I DROVE THE CAR INTO THE GARAGE. PUT IT IN PARK AND TURNED THE CAR OFF. I NORMALLY PUT THE PARKING BRAKE ON. I OPENED THE CHARGING DOOR BUT DID NOT PLUG IT IN IMMEDIATELY. I TOOK GROCERIES INTO THE HOUSE AND RETURNED FOR MORE. AS I WALKED BACK INTO THE GARAGE IT LOOKED LIKE THE CAR LURCHED BACKWARD. IT MOVED 2 FEET BACK AND WOULD HAVE HIT THE GARAGE DOOR IF IT WAS CLOSED. MAYBE IT ROLLED AND THEN CAUGHT ITSELF AND LOOKED LIKE IT LURCHED BACKWARD. THE GARAGE IS A NEARLY LEVEL CONCRETE SURFACE. I GOT BACK IN THE CAR. IT WAS IN PARK. I TURNED ON THE CAR TO MOVE IT FORWARD BUT BEFORE I DID, I CHECKED TO SEE IF THE PARKING BRAKE WAS ON. IT WAS NOT. I MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN TO PLACE IT ON WHEN I PULLED INTO THE GARAGE. I COULD NOT RECALL EXACTLY BUT I ALWAYS PUT THE PARKING BRAKE ON EVERY TIME I PARK THE CAR. THIS WAS SCARY BECAUSE IT ROLLED/LURCHED AT LEAST 2 FEET BACKWARD. I DID NOT SEE ANY ERROR/ALERT LIGHTS THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM.  I HAVE OWNED THE CAR ALMOST 2 YEARS AND PURCHASED A CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED CAR FROM AN AUTHORIZED KIA DEALER WITH AN EXTENDED WARRANTY.  *TR",
