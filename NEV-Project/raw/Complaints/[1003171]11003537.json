        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING ON A STREET NAMED HAMNER THIS AFTERNOON ON A WARM DAY IN THE CITY OF NORCO WITH CLEAR SKIES TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 15 MPH MY 2010 COROLLA DID NOT STOP AT A DISTANCE OF ABOUT 15 FEET WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKE PEDAL AND THAT CAUSED ME TO HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE. THE BRAKE SYSTEM FAILURE WHICH FELT LIKE THE ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM WHERE THE BRAKES DID NOT ENGAGE BUT RATHER MADE A PULSATING MOVEMENT AGAINST MY ROTORS CAUSED MY VEHICLE TO KEEP MOVING AND INEVITABLY I COULD NOT STOP MY VEHICLE. ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS I HAVE BROUGHT THIS ISSUE UP TO TOYOTA SERVICE DEPARTMENTS AT NUMEROUS DEALERS IN THE PAST YEARS AND I WAS GIVEN NO SOLUTIONS. THE EXPLANATION AFTER SHOWING THE TECHNICIANS WAS THAT IT WAS NORMAL AND SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM. THIS BRAKE ISSUE CAUSED ME TO NOT HAVE BRAKING SYSTEM POWER TO SAFELY COME TO A STOP PRIOR TO THE COLLISION TODAY. I BELIEVE THAT TOYOTA IS LIABLE FOR THE FAILURE IN THE BRAKE SYSTEM INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE DAMAGE CREATED TODAY TO NOT ONLY MY VEHICLE BUT ALSO TO THE VEHICLE TO WHICH THIS ACCIDENT TODAY INVOLVED INCLUDING ANY KNOWN OR UNKNOWN INJURIES INCURRED.     PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT I CAN DO TO RESOLVE THIS MATTER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.",
