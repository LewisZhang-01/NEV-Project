NO MATTER IF MY SWITCH IS ON AUTO OR OFF MY LIGHTS STILL STAY ON. WHEN I TURN OFF THE CAR AND AT TIMES I CANT GET MY KEY OUT OF THE IGNITION I HAVE TO WIGGLE THE SHIFTIER, AND IF THAT DOSE NOT WORK THEN I PUT MY SEAT BELT BACK ON AND PUSH THE LOCK AND UNLOCK BUTTON ON MY KEY FOB. SO WITH ALL OF THIS I CANT USE THE ALARM NOR THE ABILITY TO UNLOCK MY DOOR AND TO HAVE MY INTERIOR LIGHTS COME ON AT NIGHT. THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED BECAUSE OF THE NIGHT TIME SECURITY FEATURES.",
