I WAS DRIVING ABOUT 65 MPH ON THE FREEWAY WHEN THE TREAD OF THE FRONT DRIVER-SIDE TIRE SEPARATED FROM THE REST OF THE TIRE.  THE TREAD WAS WHIPPING AROUND AND CAUSED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE FRONT WHEEL WELL AND I LOST MY BRAKE FLUID.  I WAS LUCKY THAT NO ONE IN THE CAR WAS INJURED.  I DON'T THINK I HIT A FOREIGN OBJECT OR A POTHOLE.  I WENT TO THE TIRE RETAILER TWICE BUT HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.  I SENT A LETTER AND AN E-MAIL TO TIRECO, THE PARENT COMPANY OF MILESTAR, BUT THEY NEVER RESPONDED EITHER.  THANK YOU.",
