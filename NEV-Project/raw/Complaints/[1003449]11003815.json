ACCORDING TO THE VEHICLES MANUEL THIS WE MAY HAVE A PASSENGER AIR BAG DEPLOY WHEN IT SHOULD BE OFF AND THE DRIVERS SIDE AIR BAG WILL NOT DEPLOY WHEN IT SHOULD.  THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM AND DURING MY RESEARCH FOUND AT LEAST 50+ KIA OWNERS WITH THIS PROBLEM.  PLEASE CHECK THIS OUT AND HAVE KIA REPAIR THESE VEHICLES UNDER A RECALL NOTICE.  I BELIEVE MY WARRANTY IS STILL VALID BUT NOT SURE KIA WILL FIX THIS WITHOUT PRODDING.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT MATTER.",
