        "summary": "DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC AT 65 MPH THE VEHICLE STARTED KNOCKING LOUDLY THEN A LOUD BOOM AND ALL THIS BLACK SMOKE CAME FROM THE BACK END. THE VEHICLE ENGINE SEIZED AND I WAS ALMOST KILLED BY A SEMI TRUCK TRYING TO GET OFF THE HIGHWAY AS THE ENGINE COMPLETELY DIED.  THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT WHERE I PURCHASED IT AND THEY ADVISED THAT THE ENGINE ROD BLEW A HUGE HOLE IN MY ENGINE AND IT WAS NO GOOD.  THE VEHICLE HAD ONLY 61K MILES PRACTICALLY BRAND NEW.  OPENED A CASE WITH HYUNDAI AND THEY BASICALLY TOLD ME I HAD NO WARRANTY.  THIS IS A DEFECT IN THE ENGINE.  ALSO THERE ARE TWO OTHER SAME MAKE MODEL AND YEAR THAT WERE ALSO UP AT THE SERVICE STATION FOR THE EXACT SAME ISSUE AND WITH LOW MILES AND HYUNDAI REFUSED TO MAKE THE MATTER RIGHT BY REPLACING THE MOTORS.  THIS IS NOT RIGHT AND RIPPING OFF THE AMERICAN CONSUMER.  7300$ FOR A REPLACEMENT MOTOR AND THE VEHICLE IS PRACTICALLY NEW WITH THE LOW MILES I HAVE.",
