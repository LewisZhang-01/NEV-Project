I TURNED OFF THE CAR AND STARTED IT AGAIN AND THE STEERING APPEARED TO WORK. VERY FRIGHTENING DRIVE HOME. LOOKED UP THE ISSUE ONLINE AND FOUND NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS EXACTLY LIKE MINE. ALSO SAW FORD ISSUED A RECALL FOR MODEL YEARS EXCEPT 2010 FOR THE SAME ISSUE. I THINK THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED AND INCLUDED IN THE SAME RECALL.",
