JUST GOT BACK FROM A VACATION THAT WAS DELAYED 2 HOURS DUE TO THE TRANSMISSION ISSUE AND WE LOST ACCELERATION ON I75 IN FLORIDA.  WE WERE ALMOST HIT BY TWO SEMI TRUCKS.  THE RPMS JUST REG UP AND THE CAR LOSES POWER DECELERATION IS FAST AND DANGEROUS.    THE ISSUE WITH THE CVT FROM NISSAN HAS BEEN FIXED AFTER 2010.  I WANT TO GET THIS FIXED BY NISSAN ASAP AS OUR ROGUE HAS 97K MILES AND HAS BEEN DOING THIS SINCE 60K BUT THE 2012S AREN'T INCLUDED.  MY LAWYER IS WORKING CLOSING ON THIS MATTER AS WELL.  IT SEEMS LIKE NISSAN NEEDS PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY DIE BEFORE THEY TAKE ACTION.",
