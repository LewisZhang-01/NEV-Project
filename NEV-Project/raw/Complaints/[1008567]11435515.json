Over the past 2 years or so my OEM leather like steering wheel wrap started to wrinkle. it is now cracking and starting to peel.  it hasn't caused any stealing control issues, it is just ugly an slight distracting on the palm of the hand.  I do worry that if might start causing gripping issues on that side of the steering wheel if the wrap becomes loose.",
