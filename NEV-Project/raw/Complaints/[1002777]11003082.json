        "summary": "I HAVE A 2012 FORD F-250 6.7 LITER DIESEL, THE TRUCK HAS 63,000 MILES ON IT AND IS UNDER EXTENDED WARRANTY THROUGH FORD, ABOUT 2 WEEKS AGO TRUCK ENGINE SUDDENLY DIED, LUCKILY WE WERE NOT TRAVELING AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. I HAD TRUCK TOWED TO FORD DEALERSHIP AND THEY DIAGNOSED IT AS CONTAMINATED FUEL, WHICH RESULTED IN COMPLETE FAILURE OF FUEL SYSTEM. COST FOR THIS REPAIR IS $10,500 AND FORD EXTENDED WARRANTY DOESN'T COVER BAD FUEL. PROBLEM IS I ONLY GET MY FUEL FROM ONE STATION AND THEY TESTED NEGATIVE FOR CONTAMINATION. MY FEELINGS ABOUT THIS IS THERE WAS NO CONTAMINATED FUEL, BUT INSTEAD A FAULTY COMPONENT IN MY FUEL SYSTEM. MEANING FORD SHOULD BACK UP THERE PRODUCT. AT THIS TIME THE PROBLEM IS BEING INVESTIGATED BUT FORD IS ALREADY SAYING I NEED TO GO THROUGH MY INSURANCE",
