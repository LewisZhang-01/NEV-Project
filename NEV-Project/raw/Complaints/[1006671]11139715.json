IF THEY CAN NOT FIND A USED ONE, THE TRUCK IS TOTALLY WORTHLESS.  DODGE HAD STOPPED PRODUCING THE PCM. BECAUSE OF THIS DODGE IS FORCING ME TO REPLACE A PERFECTLY GOOD TRUCK EXCEPT FOR THE PCM.  BECAUSE THE TRUCK WAS DRIVEN IN CALIFORNIA EXCEPT FOR THE LAST 4 YEARS, THERE IS NO RUST.  THERE HAS BEEN NO RECALL.  I DON'T FEEL I SHOULD HAVE TO BUY A NEW/USED TRUCK BECAUSE DODGE DOES NOT WANT TO MAKE THE PCM.  THEY ARE PRODUCING VEHICLES KNOWING THE VEHICLE CAN'T BE FIXED AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT TIME.",
