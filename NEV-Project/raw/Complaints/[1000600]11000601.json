A LITTLE OVER ONE YEAR LATER NOW READING 155,700 MILES I AM HAVING THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. I DRIVE DAILY ON INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS PUSHING 70MPH FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AT A TIME. LUCKILY I WAS ONLY ON A BACK ROAD WHEN \"SERVICE POWER STEERING NOW\" LIGHT CAME ON AND I LOST ALL CONTROL OF STEERING. COULD BE KILLED DRIVING TO WORK WHEN I THOUGH I ALREADY REPLACE THE PROBLEM JUST TO HAVE IT MESS UP 50 THOUSAND MILES LATER.",
