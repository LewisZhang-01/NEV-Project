GENERAL MOTORS IS TELLING ME THAT THEY ARE REVIEWING A RECALL. IN THE MEANTIME I AM DRIVING AND INCREDIBLY UNSAFE VEHICLE. IT IS IN THE SHOP CURRENTLY FOR OTHER REASONS, AND I'M DRIVING A 2015 LONER AND THE DIFFERENCE IN THE LOW BEAM BRIGHTNESS IS MORE THAN SIGNIFICANT. THIS IS A VERY STRONG SAFETY ISSUE. AND GENERAL MOTORS CAN'T SERIOUSLY EXPECT SOMEONE TO PAY 1500 TO $2,000 IN REPAIRS FOR SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NEVER GO OUT. IT'S THEIR FAULT AND THEY KNOW IT.",
