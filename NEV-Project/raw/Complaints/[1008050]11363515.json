RESULTING IN THE SEATS BEING STATIONARY AND NOT WORKING.  I'VE HAD SEVERAL MECHANICS LOOK AT THIS AND HAVE REPLACED THE FUSES ABOUT 30 TIMES.  THE ONLY THING I HAVE NOT DONE YET IS HAVE THE SEATS COMPLETELY REWIRED TO GET THE POWER SEATS WORKING.  THIS HAS BEEN AN ISSUE SINCE MY HUSBAND PURCHASED THIS VAN ABOUT 5 YRS AGO. I CANNOT DRIVE OUR VAN BECAUSE THE SEATS ARE STUCK.  I'VE TALKED TO OTHER TOWN AND COUNTRY OWNERS THAT ARE HAVING SIMILAR ISSUES.",
