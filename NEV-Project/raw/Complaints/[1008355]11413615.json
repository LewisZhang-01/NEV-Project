ONLY KNOWING THE MODEL AND YEAR, THEY INDICATED THAT IT WAS LIKELY CAUSED BY THE SAME ISSUE AS DOZENS OF VEHICLES THEY HAD ON THE LOT OR ALREADY FIXED. THIS IS A SEVERE SAFETY ISSUE KNOWN BY HYUNDAI, THE GOVERNMENT (VIA EXISTING CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT SETTLEMENT), YET THE OWNERS OF THESE VEHICLES HAVE NOT BEEN NOTIFIED OR PROVIDED A SAFETY RECALL. I WAS AT GREAT RISK STALLED IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY HIGHWAY UNTIL A SHERIFF DEPUTY PASSING BY ASSISTED.",
