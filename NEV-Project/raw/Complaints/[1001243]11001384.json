THE DRIVELINE FLAILED AROUND AND DAMAGED THE EXHAUST PIPE AND THE METAL BRACKET COMMON TO THE FUEL TANK. THIS IS A 2007 TOYOTA TACOMA 4WD. I FOUND A SAFETY RECALL FOR THIS EXACT PROBLEM NHTSA # 07V324000 THAT STATES THE PROPELLER SHAFT WAS INCORRECTLY CAST AND COULD SNAP (JUST LIKE THIS ONE DID). I CALLED TOYOTA AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD NOT COVER IT BECAUSE MY VIN DID NOT MATCH WITH THIS RECALL. THE PHOTOS I AM UPLOADING SHOWS THE SHAFT BROKEN OFF IN A CLASSIC CASE OF METAL FATIGUE DUE TO IMPROPER CASTING.",
