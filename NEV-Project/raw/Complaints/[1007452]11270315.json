THE COST TO FIX IS NOT CHEAP (I CAN SHOW RECEIPT) VERY FEW SHOPS WILL WORK ON HEATER CORE FOR THIS CAR.    CAR HAS A SERIOUS ISSUE WITH HEATER CORE, & I DO NOT WANT TO EVEN GIVE MY STORY AS I WOULD JUST BECOME EVEN MORE INFURIATED. ASHAME NO LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AGAINST CHRYSLER. IT'S BAD ENOUGH THESE IDIOTS DESIGNED A VEHICLE YOU HAVE TO TAKE OFF ENTIRE BUMPER FOR TO CHANGE HEADLIGHT BUMP (WHICH COST DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF THE ALREADY EXPENSIVE BULB).    WORST PURCHASE EVER MADE, CHRYSLER COULD GIVE ME A CAR FOR FREE & I WOULD REFUSE TO TO KEEP IT AT THIS POINT. NEVER EVER AGAIN. JUST SAY NO TO CHRYSLER",
