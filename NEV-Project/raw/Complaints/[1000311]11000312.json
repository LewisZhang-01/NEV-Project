WHEN I ACCELERATE IT SMELLS LIKE A GAS COMING INTO THE CAR, MY KIDS AND I EXPERIENCE FEELING SICK AND HEADACHES. WHEN MY CAR SITS IN THE SUN I GET THIS BURNING GLUE SMELL IN THE CAR THAT ALSO GIVES ME A HEADACHE AND THERE ARE DAYS WHERE I CANNOT DRIVE MY CAR. I HAVE TAKING IT TO THE DEALERSHIP FOUR TIMES AND STILL THE ISSUE IS NOT FIXED, I HAVE SMALL CHILDREN AND I NO LONGER ALLOW THEM TO DRIVE MY VEHICLE DUE TO THE CHEMICALS THAT ARE COMING INTO MY CAR. MY CAR IS NOW STILL SITTING AT DEALERSHIP BECAUSE OF THIS SMELL.",
