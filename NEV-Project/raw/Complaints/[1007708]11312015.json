AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME IT SPONTANEOUSLY RESTARTS, TYPICALLY NEXT DAY.  AAA TOWED AND REPLACED THE FUEL PUMP WITH OEM PART, BUT IT DOES NOT HELP.  I CAN PROVIDE RECEIPT IF NEEDED.   APPEARS TO BE VERY SIMILAR SYMPTOMS TO THE 2010 AND 2013 JAGUAR XF RECALLS, BUT JAGUAR INDICATES THAT MY VIN IS NOT COVERED AND I SHOULD CONTACT THE DEALER AT MY OWN EXPENSE.  PERSISTENT PROBLEM...DANGEROUS AND NOT FAIR!  THIS HAPPENED 4 TIMES SO FAR, MOST RECENTLY YESTERDAY.   CAR HAS APX. 56K MILES ON IT.",
