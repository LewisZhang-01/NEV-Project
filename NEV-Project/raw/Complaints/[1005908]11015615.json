        "summary": "WE RECENTLY FILLED THE GAS TANK WITH FUEL AND NOTICED A STRONG FUEL ODOR AS IF SOMEONE SPILLED GAS ON THE FLOOR IN THE GARAGE. I PROCEEDED TO INVESTIGATE WHERE THE SMELL WAS COMING FROM AROUND THE CAR AND NOTICED THAT IT WAS STRONGEST ON THE PASSENGER REAR OF THE VEHICLE. I CHECKED ON LINE AND NOTICED SIMILAR ISSUES WITH THE FUEL TANK ON OTHER MERCEDES MODELS. I PROCEEDED TO REMOVE THE REAR SEAT AND ACCESS COVER TO THE FUEL TANK \"SENDING UNIT OR FUEL PUMP\" I'M NOT SURE OF THE CORRECT TERMINOLOGY, AND SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A PUDDLE OF GAS ON TOP OF THE FUEL TANK APPARATUS. I PROCEEDED TO CAREFULLY SOAK UP THE GAS WITH A RAG AND WHEN I DID I COULD SEE GAS SLOWLY SEEPING OUT OF THE CRACKS ON THE UNIT. I WILL BE TAKING THE VEHICLE TO THE MERCEDES DEALER TOMORROW.  I NOTICED THE RECALL DID NOT COVER MY VEHICLE AS IT WAS BUILT IN JULY OF 2010 WHICH IS A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THE 2011 E -CLASS EXTENDED RECALL. I HOPE THE DEALER WILL WORK WITH ME AS I CONSIDER THIS A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE RESOLVED PROFESSIONALLY AND PROMPTLY.",
