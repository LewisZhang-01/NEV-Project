I DON'T SEE A SAFETY RECALL FOR THIS VEHICLE, BUT I SEE PLENTY OF COMPLAINTS WHICH INDICATE THAT IT IS EITHER A PLASTIC PART OF THE DOOR HANDLE, OR THE LOCKING MECHANISM.  THIS SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER A SAFETY RECALL, AS IT PRESENTS A SAFETY HAZARD IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH WHERE THE DRIVER IS UNABLE TO EXIT WITHOUT ASSISTANCE SINCE RESCUERS WOULD BE DELAYED IN OPENING THE VEHICLE.  APPARENTLY ALL DOORS ON THIS VEHICLE ARE SUBJECT TO THIS SAME PROBLEM.",
