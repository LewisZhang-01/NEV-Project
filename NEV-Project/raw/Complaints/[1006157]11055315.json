        "summary": "ON DECEMBER 15, 2017, WHILE DRIVING ON I35 IN HEAVY TRAFFIC IN FORT WORTH, TEXAS, THE F150 AUTONOMOUSLY ACCELERATED TO MAXIMUM RPM AND WOULD NOT SLOW DOWN.  THE CRUISE CONTROL WAS NOT ON. WE WERE FORCED TO RIDE THE BREAKS HARD UNTIL WE WERE ABLE TO EXIT THE FREEWAY, PUT THE VEHICLE IN NEUTRAL AND BREAK TO A STOP.        WE TURNED THE VEHICLE OFF AND RESTARTED.  THE VEHICLE STILL WENT TO MAXIMUM RPMS SO WE SHUT DOWN THE VEHICLE AGAIN.  FIVE MINUTES LATER WE RESTARTED THE VEHICLE AND THE ENGINE PERFORMED NORMALLY.  WE DROVE IT IMMEDIATELY TO OUR LOCAL AUTO REPAIR SHOP. THE LOCAL AUTO REPAIR CENTER WAS NOT ABLE TO REPLICATE THE ISSUE AND THE VEHICLE SHOWS NO FAULT CODES.  UPON SEARCHING THE INTERNET, WE DISCOVERED NO OPEN RECALLS ON THIS VEHICLE AND  WE ARE NOT THE ONLY FORD CUSTOMERS TO EXPERIENCE THIS ISSUE.",
