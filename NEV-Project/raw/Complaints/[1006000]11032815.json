CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE WE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE AND THEY SAID WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR A NEW SEATBELT AND INSTALLATION COST.  I CONTACTED A FEW OTHER MANUFACTURERS AND WAS TOLD THAT DUE TO THIS BEING A SAFETY ISSUE THEY WOULD REPLACE AT NO COST TO THE CONSUMER.  THE SEATBELT IS NOT MEANT TO WEAR OUT AND THEY SAID THAT IT WAS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED.    THE SECOND ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH THE BRAKE LIGHTS.  REPLACED BULBS, FUSES AND CHECKED WIRING NO PROBLEMS YET THE BRAKE LIGHT DO NOT WORK.  TOYOTA'S IS AWARE OF THE ISSUE AND STATES THAT THE CONSUMER CAN PAY $400 TO HAVE IT CHECKED AND IT STILL DOES NOT WORK.",
