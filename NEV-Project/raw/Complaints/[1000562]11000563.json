        "summary": "I LIVE IN LAS VEGAS NEVADA, THIS VEHICLE OVERHEATS AND SHUTS THE AIR CONDITIONER OFF WHEN IT REACHES  75% ON THE TEMPERATURE GAGE. ANYTIME THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE IS ABOVE 100+ DEGREES THE CAR WILL REACH 75%  WHILE DRIVING IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES, IF THE CAR IS STATIONARY IT'LL GET THERE IN ABOUT 10 TO 15 MINUTES. HYUNDAI MANUFACTURING HAS SAID THAT THIS IS DUE TO A SMALL RADIATOR AND A SMALL  COOLING FAN BUT WILL CURRENTLY NOT REPAIR THESE ISSUES. MOST HYUNDAI DEALERSHIPS WILL CLAIM THAT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM OR THAT THE CAR DOES NOT HAVE A PROBLEM. THE PHOTOGRAPHS DEPICT THE TEMPERATURE RISING WHILE DRIVING THE CAR. THE ONLY TIME THE TEMPERATURE WENT DOWN WAS WHEN I MANUALLY SHUT THE AC OFF.",
