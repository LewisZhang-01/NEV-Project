        "summary": "OUR ENGINE IS ALWAYS SO LOW ON OIL IT DOES NOT REGISTER ON THE DIP STICK.  IN THIS STATE I ADD 1.5 QUARTS OF OIL.  I READ ONLINE THAT A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF HONDA VEHICLES HAVE THIS ISSUE WHEN OUR VEHICLE TRIGGERED A CHECK ENGINE CODE AND LOOKED UP THE CODE.  I BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALER IN WESTMINSTER CA AND THEY DID A CHECK FOR OIL CONSUMPTION AND HAD US RETURN IN 1000 MILES.  WHEN WE HIT THAT MILEAGE 3 WEEKS LATER I CHECKED THE OIL IN THE MORNING BEFORE RETURNING TO THE DEALER AND AGAIN THE OIL DID NOT REGISTER ON THE DIP STICK. THE DEALER HAD THE VAN FOR 4 HOURS AND THEN TOLD US IT WAS CHECKED AND FOUND TO BE 0.60 QUARTS LOW AND THAT THEY CONSIDERED IT WITH NORMAL RANGE OF OIL CONSUMPTION.  I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THEY LIED AND THAT THE VAN WAS AT LEAST 1.25 QUARTS LOW.  HAVE NO IDEA WHAT OUR OPTIONS ARE NOW SINCE I FEEL THE DEALER WAS DISHONEST, JUST KEEP ADDING 1-2 QUARTS EVERY FEW WEEKS AND HOPE THE ENGINE DOES NOT FAIL I GUESS.",
