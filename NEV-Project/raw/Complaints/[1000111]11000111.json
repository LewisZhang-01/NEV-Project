        "summary": "ON 6/15/2017, THE DRIVER'S SIDE AIRBAG IN MY 2008 TOYOTA 4RUNNER DID NOT ACTIVATE DURING A FRONTAL, 35 TO 40 MPH COLLISION.  I WAS TRAVELING AT ABOUT 35 TO 40 MPH ON A FOUR-LANE STATE ROAD.  ANOTHER DRIVER PULLED OUT IN FRONT OF ME FROM A TWO-LANE STATE ROAD.  I COULDN'T STOP AND RAN INTO THE DRIVER'S SIDE OF THAT VEHICLE.  THE RESULT WAS A \"T-BONE\" TRAFFIC ACCIDENT.  I WAS WEARING MY SEATBELT AND MY AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY.  I SUFFERED SOMEWHAT MINOR INJURIES TO MY RIGHT HAND, THE RIGHT SIDE OF MY CHEST, AND MY RIGHT FOOT AND ANKLE.  THE LEFT REAR SIDE OF MY NECK WAS SORE.  I COULD NOT WALK DUE TO THE FOOT/ANKLE INJURY SO I WAS TRANSPORTED BY AMBULANCE TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM.  THE OTHER DRIVER WAS NOT INJURED BUT I THINK HIS PASSENGER MIGHT HAVE BEEN.  THE OTHER DRIVER WAS CITED FOR \"FAILURE TO YIELD TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC\".    MANY POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS ON SCENE ASKED ME WHY MY AIRBAG DID NOT DEPLOY.    THEY ALL THOUGHT IT SHOULD HAVE WORKED DUE TO THE DAMAGE THEY OBSERVED ON MY VEHICLE.  MY 4RUNNER HAS NOT BEEN SUBJECT TO RECALL.  I HAVE PHOTOS OF MY 4RUNNER, INJURIES, AND THE POLICE ACCIDENT REPORT AVAILABLE BUT I COULD NOT ATTACH THEM TO THIS LETTER.   I CAN FORWARD THEM TO ANY INTERESTED PARTY VIA EMAIL.  CHESTERFIELD COUNTY VIRGINIA POLICE REPORT #201706150337.  I PURCHASED THE 4RUNNER USED FROM STAFFORD TOYOTA IN STAFFORD, VA.  A CHECK WITH \"CARFAX\" REVEALED NO PREVIOUS ACCIDENTS WITH THIS 4RUNNER.",
