THEN, THE SAME NIGHT, I BOUGHT SOME COOLANT AND HAD IT CHECKED OUT AT THE NEAREST AUTO ZONE. COUPLE OF DAYS LATER THOUGH, THE CAR HAD SHUT OFF AGAIN. LUCKILY, EACH TIME WAS ON THE STREET SO I CAN FLASH MY EMERGENCY SIGNAL. HOWEVER, I AM VERY CONCERNED WITH THIS RECENT NEWS UPDATE AND ENSURE MY SAFETY.",
