THE SECOND TIME IT HAPPENED WAS 2 DAYS LATER. THIS TIME I WAS WITH MY 3 YEAR OLD TODDLER RUNNING ERRANDS. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE IT PARKED IN MY DRIVEWAY WHEN IT HAPPENED. I CAME OUT TO GO PICK UP MY HUSBAND FROM WORK AND IT WOULDN'T MOVE. I CALLED HONDA THE NEXT DAY THEY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT WASN'T MOVING EITHER. I TOWED IT TO THEIR SERVICE CENTER AND RECEIVE A CALL THAT IT WILL  COST ME 1200 DOLLARS TO REPLACE THE EPS UNIT. WHY IT HAPPENED? THEY DON'T KNOW... A 3 YEAR OLD CAR THAT I AM STILL MAKING PAYMENTS ON JUST DECIDED TO FRY ITS EPS UNIT!!! HOW FRUSTRATING! I AM GRATEFUL THAT I WASN'T ON THE HIGHWAY OR ON THE ROAD AND IT FOR IT TO STOP. WHERE IN OTHER CASES I'VE READ ONLINE THAT IT HAD HAPPENED TO PARENTS!",
