WE CALLED KIA AND THEY TOLD ME I HAVE TO PAY TO GET IT FIXED. IT HAS BEEN PROVEN THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING SYSTEM ON THEIR CARS. MINE NOW HAS IT. IT SHOULD BE FIXED AT THEIR EXPENSE LIKE THEY DID THE OTHERS. THE CAR WAS BEING DRIVEN WHEN THE POP HAPPENED AND THERE IS A LOT OF PLAY IN THE STEERING. WE HAVE HARDLY BEEN DRIVING THE CAR BECAUSE WE ARE AFRAID. THE PROBLEM IS REALLY BAD IF YOU TRY TO TURN IT TO THE LEFT.",
