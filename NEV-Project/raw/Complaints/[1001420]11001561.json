I SHUT THE CAR OFF & STARTED IT AGAIN. IT DID THE SAME THING. I CUT IT OFF BUT IT DID THE SAME THING. I CUT IT OFF 1 MORE TIME BECAUSE I DID NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING IT & WAITED A MINUTE BEFORE TRYING TO START IT AGAIN. SURPRISINGLY THE ENGINE WAS RUNNING ROUGH. I TOOK IT TO AN AUTO STORE WHERE THE CODES SHOWED THROTTLE ISSUES. I TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC. HE DID SOME ADDITIONAL TESTS & INFORMED ME THAT I HAD A BAD THROTTLE BODY. I HAD TO HAVE THIS REPLACED WHICH I WAS INFORMED THAT GM HAS HAD ISSUES WITH THROTTLE BODY & COMPONENTS. VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN. IM CONCERNED THAT THIS MIGHT HAPPEN AGAIN OR HAPPEN DURING DRIVING.",
