NOW MY STEERING ASSIST FAULT LIGHT IS ON AND MY POWER STEERING WENT OUT COMPLETELY WHILE TURNING INTO MY DRIVEWAY. THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE. I HAVE NOTICED THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE THE SAME ISSUE AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN HORRIBLE ACCIDENTS. WHAT IF THIS WAS TO HAPPEN TO ME AND MY CHILDREN? IT WOULDN'T JUST AFFECT OUR LIVES BUT ALSO OUR LOVED ONES. I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW IF THERE IS A RECALL ON THIS OR THERE IS AN ABILITY TO GET MY MONEY BACK ON THE CAR.",
