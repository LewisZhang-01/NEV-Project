        "summary": "MY BATTERY LIGHT CAME ON WHEN I WAS LEAVING THE GROCERY STORE. ABOUT A MILE AWAY I STOPPED AT STOPLIGHT AT A BUSY INTERSECTION ON THE HIGHWAY AND DASH LIGHTS STARTED COMING ON AND OFF, RADIO AND AC COMING ON AND OFF AND THEN CAR DIES AND WILL NOT RESTART. AFTER 5 OR 10 MINUTES GET IT RESTARTED AND WILL BARELY MOVE. LUCKILY THERE WAS AN AUTO PARTS STORE JUST AROUND THE CORNER. WHEN I PULL IN THE PARKING LOT, CAR WILL NOT SHIFT OUT OF DRIVE, WILL NOT SHUT OFF, WIND SHIELD WIPERS COME ON AND WON'T GO OFF, GAUGES ALL GOING CRAZY AND HAVE TO USE EMERGENCY BRAKE SO MY CAR WON'T RUN THROUGH THE FRONT OF THE STORE WHILE I GO INTO STORE TO GET HELP. THE GUY HOOKS UP TO DIAGNOSTIC DEVICE AND IT GIVES A READ ERROR. (HOOKS UP TO ANOTHER CAR AND NO ERROR). FINALLY GET CAR TO SHUT OFF AFTER ABOUT 20 MINUTES. HE TESTS BATTERY AND COMES BACK LOW. NEW $200 BATTERY AND STARTS UP FINE, EVERYTHING WORKING AGAIN. PULL OUT OF PARKING LOT AND START SMELLING SOMETHING BURNING, SMOKE COMING THROUGH VENTS, WEIRD SOUND. PULL OVER AND SAME THINGS HAPPEN - GAUGES GOING CRAZY, WIPERS ON, WON'T SHIFT OUT OF DRIVE, WON'T TURN OFF. GET OUT OF CAR AND TAKE KEY OUT WITH ME AND WIPERS COME ON. HAVE TO TAKE OUT FUSE TO GET THEM TO GO OFF. LIGHTS COME ON. HAVE TO DISCONNECT BATTERY TO GET THEM OFF - ALL OF THIS WHEN THE KEY IS NOT EVEN IN THE CAR! $60 TO HAVE CAR TOWED TO SHOP AND $600 TO HAVE ALTERNATOR REPLACED. WHY IS THE 180 AMP ALTERNATOR NOT PART OF THE P60 RECALL WHEN IT IS HAVING THE SAME EXACT ISSUES AS THE 160 AMP ALTERNATOR THAT WAS RECALLED??? I KEEP SEEING OTHERS SAYING THEY KEEP HAVING THE ALTERNATOR GO OUT AGAIN EVEN AFTER THEY REPLACE IT. I HAVE HAD THIS CAR FOR 5 YEARS AND NEVER AND PROBLEMS WITH IT OTHER THAN GENERAL MAINTENANCE STUFF. I DON'T NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING IT ANY LONGER.",
