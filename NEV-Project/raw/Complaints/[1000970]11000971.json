I RESET THE LIGHT AND IT WILL COME ON AGAIN AFTER DRIVING A HALF MILE. I TOOK IT BACK TO MY DEALER TWICE THEY RAN A SCAN ON IT EACH TIME A FOUND THE FAULT WAS THE NEW TIRE BEING LARGER THAN THE OTHER THREE TIRES THAT HAVE ONLY 30,000 MILES ON THEM. I TALKED TO THE HONDA CUSTOMER  SERVICE THEIR ONLY  ADVISED WAS TO GO TO A ANOTHER DEALER. I DID SAME RESULTS AND 35.00 DOLLARS POORER. I CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE BACK SAY SAID TO BAD. A DEALER SUGGESTED I BUY 3 NEW TIRES, DEFLATE NEW TIRE AND INFLATE THE OTHER 3 TO MAKE THEM THE SAME DIAMETER, BUY A USED TIRE, I BELIEVE HONDA HAS A SOFTWARE PROBLEM IN THAT THE TPMS WILL NOT STAY SET AFTER THE BUTTON HAS BEEN PUSHED. THE COMPUTER SHOULD HAVE LEARNED THE NEW PARAMETERS.",
