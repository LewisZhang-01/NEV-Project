        "summary": "HAVING BOUGHT A 2013 VOLVO XC90 WITH 36K MILES ON IT, I WAS DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY 2 WEEKS LATER WHEN I SAW SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE ENGINE. THE ENGINE STALLED AND SHUT DOWN. I QUICKLY PULLED OVER THE CAR AND WAS ABLE TO GET OUT AS THE SMOKE WAS INCREASING. WITHIN 4-5 MINUTES, THE CAR WAS ON FIRE. IT WAS COMPLETELY GUTTED AND DESTROYED. VOLVO DECLINED TO ACCEPT BLAME AND SAID THAT THE CAUSE OF FIRE CANNOT BE DETERMINED. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SAFEST CAR AND I WAS SURPRISED AT THEIR CALLOUS ATTITUDE. THE DEALER FROM SUMMIT NJ WAS FAR MORE PROFESSIONAL. THE HIGHWAY IT HAPPENED ON WAS RT. 295 NEAR PRINCETON NJ. I HOPE OTHERS CAN LEARN FROM THIS DEBACLE AND GET SOME HELP IF THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH 2013 XC90. THEY DID HAVE A RECALL FOR THE 2010 XC90 FOR THE SAME REASON. I FEEL THE CAUSE WAS EITHER AN ELECTRICAL SHORT CIRCUIT OR A PROBLEM WITH TRANSMISSION.",
