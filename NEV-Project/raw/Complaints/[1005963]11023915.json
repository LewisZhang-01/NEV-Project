FLORIDIAN HAS DIED -- THIS TIME, A 34YR OLD WOMAN, 07.28.2017.   DURING THE MANDATORY HURRICANE EVACUATION, OUR FAMILY WAS FORCED TO USE OUR FRONT PASSENGER SEAT. THANK G-D NOTHING HAPPENED, BUT THIS CORRECTIVE PERIOD IS GONE ON TOO LONG.   WE HAVE BEEN WAITING MONTHS FOR RESOLUTION -- AND ALL WE ARE TOLD IS THAT THE NECESSARY PART IS UNAVAILABLE AND TO WAIT LONGER -- AND IN THE INTERIM PLACE OUR FAMILY IN A POTENTIALLY DEADLY SITUATION.   WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE TO GET THE REPLACEMENT AIR BAG?! DOES SOMEONE'S TEENAGE CHILD HAVE TO DIE DURING A MANDATORY EVACUATION IN ORDER FOR RESOLUTION TO HAPPEN?!   I AM TIRED OF BEING PATIENT.   PLEASE, SOMEONE EXPLAIN THE LACK OF APPARENT URGENCY. HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE NEED TO DIE? THE DEATH TOLL ESTIMATE IS NOW 19.   HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE NEED TO DIE BEFORE THE REST OF US GET ANSWERS?!?!",
