        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 2019 RAV4 HYBRID IN APRIL OF 2019. ONE ISSUE WITH THE CAR THAT I HAVE NOT GOTTEN A RESOLUTION FOR IS THAT THE FUEL GAUGE IS INACCURATE. ON FILLING THE TANK, IT ONLY SHOWS ABOUT 7/8 FULL. THE ONLY WAY TO GET IT TOTALLY FULL IS TO 'TOP IT OFF' WHICH IS ILLEGAL IN OREGON WHERE I LIVE. THE FUEL TANK HOLDS 14.5 GALLONS. ON THE WAY BACK FROM A RECENT TRIP, I LET THE FUEL GAUGE GO DOWN UNTIL THE DASH BOARD SCREEN SAID I HAD 13 MILES LEFT UNTIL I WAS GOING TO BE OUT OF FUEL. I TOLD THE GAS STATION ATTENDANT HELP ME THIS ONE TIME BY 'TOPPING OFF' THE TANK TO CHECK THE GALLONS NEEDED. THE TANK WAS FULL AFTER ADDING JUST 12 GALLONS. THAT MEANS I HAD 2.5 GALLONS LEFT IN THE TANK WHEN THE DASH BOARD FUEL WARNING SAID I HAD 13 MILES TO GO BEFORE I WAS OUT OF GAS. THIS VEHICLE CONSISTENTLY GETS 40-45 MPG. I FEEL IT IS DANGEROUS NOT TO HAVE THE CORRECT FUEL TOTAL AVAILABLE. I TOOK THE VEHICLE INTO MY TOYOTA DEALER (LITHIA TOYOTA OF SPRINGFIELD, OREGON) IN MAY OF 2019 TO HAVE THIS ISSUE CHECKED OUT. THE DEALER SAID THE DID A THOROUGH CHECK OF THE SYSTEMS THAT MAY BE INVOLVED, BUT COULD FIND NO PROBLEM. I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY RECALLS BY TOYOTA CONCERNING THIS MATTER.",
