AFTER DROPPING MY TRUCK OFF TODAY THEY SAID THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO REPAIR IT IF THEY GET THE PARTS FROM TOYOTA, WHICH THEY SAID COULD TAKE MONTHS.  MY QUESTION IS, WHY SHOULD THEY INCONVENIENCE ME FOR MONTHS TO REPAIR MY VEHICLE.  TOYOTA REQUIRED ME TO LEAVE MY VEHICLE AT THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE IT IS A SAFETY RECALL.  THEY DID PROVIDE ME WITH A RENTAL CAR, WHICH DOES ME NO GOOD BECAUSE I BOUGHT A TRUCK AND I NEED A TRUCK.  AT THE DEALERSHIP AT VINELAND NJ  THEY ALREADY HAD 15 TACOMA'S IN THE BACK LOT.  THE MANAGER TOLD ME THEY WOULD BE FIXED ON A FIRST COME FIRST SERVE BASIS.  HE SAID HE HAD A SMALL DEALERSHIP AND HE WASN'T SURE HOW FAST HE COULD GET PARTS BECAUSE THERE WERE 288,000 TACOMA'S INVOLVED.  I AM OUT OF A TRUCK FOR GOD KNOWS HOW LONG.",
