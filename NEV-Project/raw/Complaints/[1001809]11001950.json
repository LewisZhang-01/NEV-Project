WITHIN A FEW MINUTES, WE NOTICED A FIRE IN THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT.  WE ATTEMPTED TO PUT OUT THE FIRE WITH THREE EXTINGUISHERS BUT WERE NOT ABLE TO DO SO.  ANOTHER EMPLOYEE CALLED 911 AND THE LOCAL FIRE DPT. PUT OUT THE FIRE.  THE VEHICLE WAS A TOTAL LOSS.  WE CONTACTED CHRYSLER WHO SENT AN INVESTIGATOR TO INSPECT THE DAMAGE.  CHRYSLER LATER SENT US AN E-MAIL STATING THEY COULD NOT  DETERMINE THAT THE FIRE WAS A RESULT OF A \"MANUFACTURING OR ASSEMBLY ERROR\".  WE BELIEVE THE DAMAGE IS A RESULT OF A DEFECT IN THE VEHICLE.  EVEN THOUGH THE VEHICLE IS STILL UNDER THE POWERTRAIN WARRANTY, CHRYSLER REFUSES TO COVER THE LOSS.",
