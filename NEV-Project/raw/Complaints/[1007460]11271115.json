THERE'S BEEN 1 YEAR AND A HALF SINCE THEN AND GOT LIKE A HUNDRED OF NOTIFICATIONS. I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THAT THE DEALER DIDN'T DO THE REPLACEMENT. OR MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T  UPDATED THE DATABASE? I'M WORRIED BECAUSE THE MAZDA DEALER IS TELLING ME TO IGNORE THOSE NOTIFICATIONS. I'M TRYING TO CONTACT YOU BUT THERE'S NO WAY TO CONTACT ANYBODY IN NHTSA. THIS IS THE 2ND TIME I FILE A COMPLAINT AND THERE'S NO RESPONSE. I THINK YOU AREN'T DOING ENOUGH WITH THIS EMERGENCY.
