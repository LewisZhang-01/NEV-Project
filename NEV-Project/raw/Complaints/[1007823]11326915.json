        "summary": "SINCE PURCHASING CAR AS CERTIFIED USED FROM DEALERSHIP IN JANUARY 2020, THE OVERLY DIM LOW BEAMS HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE. CAN HARDLY SEE AT NIGHT, ESPECIALLY IN INCLEMENT WEATHER. I IMMEDIATELY FLAGGED THE PROBLEM, AND DEALERSHIP CHANGED OUT BULBS WHILE UNDER WARRANTY. THE PROBLEM CONTINUED. WELL, THE LOW VISIBILITY ULTIMATELY PARTICIPATED IN A RECENT RUN IN WITH A BEAR. CLEAR NIGHT, DRY ROADS, JUST DIMINISHED VISION. I JUST COULD NOT SEE THE MASSIVE, BLACK BODY OF THE ANIMAL CROSSING THE DARK ROAD. IT RESULTED IN $9000 PLUS IN DAMAGES. MIRACULOUSLY, I WAS NOT SERIOUSLY INJURED IN THE CRASH, AND INSURANCE COVERED THE CLAIM. NOW THAT IT HAS BEEN REPAIRED AND I AM BACK BEHIND THE WHEEL, I AM PETRIFIED TO HAVE A RE-OCCURRENCE. GM SHOULD RECALL PERTAINING VEHICLES AND SUCK UP THE COST TO INSTALL HID/LED HOUSING AND BULBS. IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE THAT, AFTER ALL THE COMPLAINTS AND CONCERNS ABOUT THIS KNOWN ISSUE, GM IS NOT APPROACHING THIS AS A VERY SERIOUS RISK TO SAFETY AND THAT LIVES MAY HAVE TO BE LOST BEFORE ACTION IS TAKEN. I WAS LUCKY, THE NEXT PERSON MAY NOT BE.  *TR",
