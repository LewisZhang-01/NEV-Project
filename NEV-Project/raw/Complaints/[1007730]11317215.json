THEN WHEN TRYING TO ACCELERATE I CAN ONLY GET UP TO 20 MPH. ALSO IF I TAKE MY FOOT OFF THE GAS, WITHOUT PUTTING MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE, IT'LL COME TO A HALT. IT DOES GO OVER 2,500 RPM ON A GOOD DAY. I CANT TAKE OFF FAST EVEN IF I WANTED TO. THE ONLY CODE THAT HAS COME UP WHEN DEALING WITH MY ISSUE IS THE CATALYIC CONVERTER. I HAVE REPLACED MY O2 SENSORS AND GOT A NEW CONVERTER ON BUT STILL HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. I EVEN REPLACED THE THROTTLE TO SEE IF THAT WOULD HELP AND IT HAS NOT. NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO HELP ME FIGURE OUT THE ISSUE. I HAVE TAKEN IT TO REPUTABLE SHOPS AND MECHANIC AND SPENT A TON OF MONEY TRYING TO RESOLVE MY ISSUES. I AM FEARFUL FOR MY SAFETY AND MY SON'S SAFETY NOT KNOWING WHEN IT WILL LOSE POWER. I CANT EVEN HOLD A JOB AT THE TIME BEING BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE WITH MY TRUCK.",
