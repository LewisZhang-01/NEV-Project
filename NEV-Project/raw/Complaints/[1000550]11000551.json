        "summary": "WE HAVE PURCHASED A CHILD CAR SEAT MADE BY GRACO (MODEL 1968354) FROM BABIESRUS AND BEFORE THE BABY ARRIVES WE DECIDED TO TEST THE CAR SEAT - MOUNT, GET USED WITH IT IN THE CAR, ETC.  AS THE CHILD CAR SEAT WAS MOUNTED ON MY 2016 BMW 328I AND DRIVING AT AROUND 60 MPH A SUDDEN HARD BRAKE BECAUSE OF A TRAFFIC STOP. THE CHILD CAR SEAT LITERALLY JUMPED FROM IT'S LATCH BETWEEN THE TWO FROM TEATS. I AM WONDER HOW SAFE WOULD HAVE BEEN IF MY CHILD WERE THERE...  I CALLED GRACO AND THEY HAVE SENT ME A NEW CAR SEAT BASE SYSTEM, WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE SAME ISSUE, THE LATCH DOESN'T HOLD THE CHILD CAR SEAT TIGHTEN, AFTER DRIVING 10-15 MILES, THE CHILD CAR SEAT LITERALLY START BOUNCING AROUND. ALSO, REMOVING THE CAR SEAT FROM IT'S BASE IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE... THESE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE SOLD WITHOUT PROPER INSPECTION, WITHOUT PROPER SAFETY CHECK.  (RELATED VEHICLE INFORMATION: MODEL YEAR=2016, MAKE=BMW, MODEL=328I)",
