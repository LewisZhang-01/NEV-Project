HE REPORTS THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE TORQUE CONVERTER AND WILL REQUIRE A TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT BY A NISSAN DEALER BECAUSE HE WAS AWARE OF ALL OF THE PROBLEMS THAT NISSAN WAS HAVING.  HE INFORMED OF OF A NATIONAL RECALL ON EARLIER MODELS FOR THE SAME REASON.  HE STATED THAT THEY CLEARLY HAVE NOT CORRECTED THE PROBLEM.  WITH FURTHER ON-LINE RESEARCH, WE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE 2011 MODELS.",
