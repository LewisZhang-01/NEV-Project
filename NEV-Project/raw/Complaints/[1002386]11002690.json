AFTER TAKING MY VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP TO DETERMINE WHAT THE CAUSE OF THE NOISE WAS, I WAS ADVISED THAT IT WAS A FAULTY FRONT RIGHT STRUT AND SPRING ASSEMBLY. I HAD MY MECHANIC REPLACE BOTH THE FRONT AND LEFT STRUTS. AFTER DOING A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THE INTERNET FROM OTHER FORD EXPLORER OWNERS , I BELIEVE THAT STRUT AND SPRING ASSEMBLY ARE MANUFACTURE DEFECTS.    WHILE BACKING UP MY VEHICLE, I NOTICED THAT THE BACK UP CAMERA WAS BLANK AND NOT WORKING. AFTER MONITORING THE OPERATION OF THE BACK UP CAMERA, IT HAS BECOME AND INTERMITTENT ISSUE, IT COMES AND GOES. NOW, MY BACK UP CAMERA IS WORKING BUT THE BACK UP CAMERA GUIDELINES ARE NOT THERE. AFTER READING MANY BLOGS, THERE' S ALOT OF   FORD EXPLORER OWNERS WHO ARE HAVING SIMILAR ISSUES WITH THE BACK UP CAMERA. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND I BELIEVE IT IS A MANUFACTURE DEFECT.",
