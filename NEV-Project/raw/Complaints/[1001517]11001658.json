THE LETTER INDICATED THAT NO PARTS WERE AVAILABLE FOR THE REPAIR AND THAT I WOULD BE CONTACTED WHEN THE REMEDY PARTS WERE AVAILABLE.  APPROXIMATELY 6 MONTHS LATER, IN EARLY JUNE, I RECEIVED A BRIGHT ORANGE \"URGENT RECALL REPAIRS\" POSTCARD FROM MY DEALERSHIP ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP, MICHAUD MITSIBUSHI IN DANVERS, MA, AND REQUESTED AN APPOINTMENT FOR RECALL REPAIRS TO THE WIPER SYSTEM.  THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT INFORMED ME THAT NO PARTS WERE AVAILABLE, AND THAT THE POSTCARD WAS SIMPLE A \"PRE-NOTIFICATION\".  THEY HAD NO IDEA WHEN PARTS WOULD BE AVAILABLE.  IN THE MEAN TIME, I'M DRIVING A VEHICLE WHOSE WIPERS COULD FAIL AT ANY TIME.",
