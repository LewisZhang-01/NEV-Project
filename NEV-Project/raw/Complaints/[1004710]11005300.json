THIS HAS HAPPENED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY DRIVING A SPEED OF 70 MILES MY CAR BEGAN TO LOOSE POWER, AND SPEED. IT WENT AS LOW AS 40 MILES AND I ALMOST HAD AN ACCIDENT AS A RESULT. I WAS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN HIGHWAY SPEED. NO WARNING LIGHTS OR INDICATORS EVER CAME ON. NEITHER WITH THE FIRST ISSUE, OR THE SECOND ISSUE. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. I WAS DRIVING WITH MY 6 YR OLD WHO HAS SPECIAL NEEDS THE FIRST TIME. I BOUGHT A NEW BATTERY THINKING THAT WOULD HELP. THEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN, WHILE DRIVING WITH MY TWO BOYS AND TWO GRANDSON'S IN THE CAR. I AGAIN LOST POWER AND COULD NOT ACCELERATE PROPERLY ON THE HIGHWAY. CARS WERE FLYING BY ME, AND I FELT HELPLESS AS THIS VEHICLE WOULDN'T MAINTAIN A PROPER HI-WAY SPEED. VERY DEBILITATING. SCARY WHEN YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER YOUR VEHICLE SPEED, AND CAN'T ACCELERATE. NISSAN STATES THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH THE CVT. THEY HAVE AGREED TO REPLACE MY TRANSMISSION AS IT HAS ALSO FAILED. BUT REFUSE TO PAY FOR THE WORK?? PLEASE HELP, AS I AM SURE I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON GOING THROUGH THIS RIGHT NOW. SO IF THEY REPLACE THE TRANSMISSION WHO'S TO SAY IT WONT HAPPEN AGAIN???",
