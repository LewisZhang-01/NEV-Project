        "summary": "THE SUNROOF EXPLODED AT APPROX 8AM 5/30/2017. THE EXPLOSION WAS PRECEDED BY A RATTLING NOISE, THEN A VERY LOUD AND SCARY BANG. I WAS TRAVELING APPROX 65 MPH ON I80 W (BETWEEN VACAVILLE AND FAIRFIELD CALIFORNIA). MORNING TEMPERATURE MILD--PROBABLY IN THE UPPER 60'S.  I PULLED OFF THE HIGHWAY AND FOUND THE SUNROOF GLASS HAD FIRST EXPANDED THEN SHATTERED. BECAUSE THE INSIDE ROOF DOOR WAS CLOSED, SHARDS OF GLASS DID NOT FALL INTO THE CAR, BUT THEY DID DO SOME DAMAGE TO THE PAINT JOB. CALLED THE DEALERSHIP WHO HAD ME BRING IT IN THE NEXT DAY--I WAS TOLD THE REPAIR WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY MY WARRANTY NOR MY EXTENDED WARRANTY BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED SOMETHING HIT THE GLASS. WHEN I TOLD THEM NOTHING HIT THE GLASS AND POINTED TO THE EXPANSION OF THE GLASS THEY STILL REFUSED TO COVER THE REPAIR. I REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO START FARM INSURANCE AND THEY COVERED THE $1850 REPAIR BILL. MY CAR WAS IN THE SHOP FOR OVER 2 WEEKS BECAUSE THE REPLACEMENT GLASS ORDERED BY THE DEALERSHIP ARRIVED SHATTERED TOO. THEY MUST BE USING INFERIOR THIN GLASS TO HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN!",
