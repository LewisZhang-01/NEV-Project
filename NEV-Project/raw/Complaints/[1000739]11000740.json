I CALLED THE DEALER AND THEY SAID TO REPLACE IT, IT WOULD BE ABOUT $500 FOR IT. IT'S RIDICULOUS FORD HASN'T ISSUED A RECALL BECAUSE THIS SEEMS LIKE A PROBLEM MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING AS WELL. WE HAVE ALMOST GOTTEN INTO A COUPLE OF ACCIDENTS BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE! WE CAN'T KEEP HAVING TO RELY ON ONE LESS VEHICLE, BUT WHAT OTHER ALTERNATIVE DO WE HAVE IF IT'S GOING TO COST US, THE CONSUMER, A LOT OF MONEY TO REPLACE FOR SOMETHING THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR.",
