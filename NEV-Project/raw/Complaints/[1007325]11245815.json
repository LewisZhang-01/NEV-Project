        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING HOME (CITY STREETS - 30-40 MPH), I NOTICED THAT THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE IN MY '09 CHARGER RT BEGAN TO CLIMB. I HAD TO STOP A FEW BLOCKS FROM HOME TO LET IT COOL DOWN. A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER I ADDED COOLANT & DROVE THE LAST 0.3 MILES. AT FIRST I THOUGHT A RADIATOR HOSE HAD FAILED, BUT I FOUND THAT THE PLASTIC BLADES ON ONE OF THE TWIN ELECTRIC COOLING FANS CAME APART & DESTROYED THE RADIATOR. A WEB SEARCH SHOWED THAT CHRYSLER ISSUED \"CUSTOMER SATISFACTION NOTIFICATION L08 - ENGINE COOLING FANS \" IN 2011 FOR THE 2006-08 MODEL YEARS DESCRIBING THE EXACT PROBLEM I EXPERIENCED. I CALLED CHRYSLER & OPENED CASE # 59502947. AFTER A FEW DAYS OF PHONE CALLS I WAS TOLD THAT MY CAR WASN'T PART OF THAT RECALL & FCA WOULD NOT ASSIST WITH REPAIRS OR EVEN SUPPLY THE PARTS. A LOCAL DODGE DEALER STATED THAT THE REPLACEMENT FAN KIT (CBHZL080AA - COOLING FAN PACKAGE) COST DEALERS ABOUT $10, BUT WAS NOT FOR SALE TO CUSTOMERS; I HAD TO BY TWO FANS INDIVIDUALLY FOR A TOTAL OF ABOUT $70. IN ADDITION, I HAD TO BUY A RADIATOR, THERMOSTAT, HOSES, CLAMPS, AND A RADIATOR CAP WHICH ADDED UP TO HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS. I SPENT THE WEEKEND GATHERING PATS & THEN REPAIRING THE VEHICLE.",
