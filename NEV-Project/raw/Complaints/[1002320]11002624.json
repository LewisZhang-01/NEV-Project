        "summary": "SO I BOUGHT THIS CAR FROM SOMEONE ON CRAIGSLIST AND WAS TOLD THE CAR WAS IN GREAT SHAPE AND THE HISTORY REPORT MENTIONED A POSSIBLE TRANSMISSION ISSUES BUT I WAS ALSO TOLD THE TRANSMISSION WAS REPLACED NOT TOO LONG AGO BY THE OWNER WHO HAD THE CAR BEFORE THE GUY I BOUGHT IT FROM. WELL AFTER HAVING THE CAR FOR 2 DAYS, THE SUBFRAME CRACKED WHICH WAS A $700 FIX AND TOOK ME MONTHS TO COME UP WITH THE MONEY AND MY CAR WAS NOT DRIVEABLE AT THE TIME. I GOT THE VUE FROM THE SHOP MAYBE 2 WEEKS AGO AND NOW THE TRANSMISSION IS GOING. WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE IT EITHER DOESN'T MOVE OR GIVES ME A LOT OF TROUBLE MOVING. WHEN I POP IT INTO DRIVE IT EITHER DOESN'T MOVE, GIVES ME TROUBLE MOVING, GOES INTO REVERSE, OR WILL MAKE A LOUD NOISE AND JERK AGGRESSIVELY BEFORE DRIVING. I TOOK THE CAR TO GET LOOKED AT AND WAS TOLD IT HAD ONE OF THE ORIGINAL CVT SATURN TRANSMISSIONS AND IT WILL NEED REPLACED. THE PROBLEM IS THE TRANSMISSION IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND AND COST MOST THAN THE CAR IS WORTH AND MORE THAN I EVEN PAID FOR THE CAR, ACCORDING TO THE MECHANICS I TOOK THE CAR TO. APPARENTLY THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM AND EVEN CAUSED A LAWSUIT WITH SATURN AND GM. SINCE THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE TYPE OF ENGINE SATURN USED, I DIDN'T KNOW IF I COULD GET IT REPLACED LIKE MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE LAWSUIT DID. I AM A BROKE AND STRUGGLING COLLEGE STUDENT AND OTHER THAN THE TRANSMISSION THIS CAR IS IN GREAT CONDITION. I AM WORRIED I WILL BE DRIVING TI ONE DAY AND THE CAR WILL STOP WORKING AND I'LL CRASH.",
