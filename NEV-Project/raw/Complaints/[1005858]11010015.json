THE LEVER TO LOOSEN STRAPS ARE PLACED RIGHT IN BETWEEN CHILD'S LEGS AND IS SUPER EASY FOR CHILDREN TO ACCESS. AS A RESULT, HE MERELY HAS TO LIFT THE LEVER TO COMPLETELY LOOSEN THE ENTIRE HARNESS. WE HAVE SEEN HIM DO THIS ON A FEW OCCASIONS AND HAVE SCOLDED HIM, HOWEVER, HE HAS SENSORY ISSUES AND OFTEN FEELS RESTRICTED. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK BACK AT HIM WHILE DRIVING TO ENSURE HE IS SAFELY BUCKLED. I CALLED GRACO TO SEE IF THERE WAS A FIX AND ALL I GOT WAS EMAIL ABOUT HOW I CAN DISTRACT MY CHILD TO PREVENT SUCH BEHAVIOR. I HAVE RESEARCHED SIMILAR PROBLEMS WITH OTHER SEATS AND DISCOVERED EVENFLO HAS BEEN RECALLING SOME OF THERE SEATS FOR THE SAME ISSUE! WHY IS GRACO NOT TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY.",
