        "summary": "A NUMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN ARIZONA ARE CONTINUING TO EXPERIENCE PROBLEMS WITH 2012-2017 CHEVROLET TAHOE PPV'S ON HIGH TEMPERATURE DAYS.  THE PROBLEM MANIFESTS ITSELF AT TEMPERATURES ABOVE 100 DEGREES, EXHIBITS LACK OF ACCELERATION PULLING INTO TRAFFIC AND STALLING WHEN BOTH IN MOTION AND SITTING IDLING.  THE, ISSUE, FOR THE ORO VALLEY POLICE DEPARTMENT WAS FIRST DIAGNOSED IN THE SUMMER OF 2015 AND INCLUDED VEHICLES IN OUR FLEET FROM 2012'S THROUGH 2015'S.  THIS SUMMER, MORE VEHICLES EXHIBITED THE ISSUES TO INCLUDE 2016'S INCLUDING ANOTHER AGENCY'S 2017 THAT BECAME AN ITEM OF DISCUSSION AT A GM CONFERENCE ON FLEET VEHICLES HELD UP IN PHOENIX.  GM SPENT APPROXIMATELY A YEAR AND A HALF TRYING TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM TO EVENTUALLY DETERMINE THAT THE FUEL PUMPS NEEDED TO BE REDESIGNED ALONG WITH A NEW HIGH PRESSURE FUEL LINE. WE HAVE HAD SOME VEHICLES RECEIVE  THE NEW PUMPS, BUT NOT ALL AS THE ISSUES WENT AWAY AS THE TEMPERATURES WENT BELOW 100.  AT THIS DATE WE ARE NOT SURE IF THE \"FIX\" IS LIMITED TO 2015'S AND 16'S AND ARE LEFT WITH POSSIBLE ISSUES WITH 2012-2014'S.  AT A GM CONFERENCE ON 6/29/17, IN DISCUSSION WITH THE REGIONAL FLEET SALES REP FOR GM, WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE WERE NO REDESIGNED FUEL PUMPS AND HIGH PRESSURES HOSES AVAILABLE IN THE U.S. AND NO TIME TABLE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF SAME.  IT WAS LEARNED AT THE GM CONFERENCE THAT NUMEROUS AGENCIES ARE EXPERIENCING THE ISSUES.  OUR DEPARTMENT HAS DOCUMENTATION THAT WOULD FAIRLY CLEARLY SHOW THAT THE ISSUES DESCRIBED ARE OCCURRING TO CIVILIAN CHEVROLET TAHOES ALSO. INDICATIONS ARE GM CONTINUES TO PUT OLD FUEL PUMPS ON VEHICLES PRODUCED AFTER THE REDESIGN.  THE POOR ACCELERATION AND STALLING IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONCERN FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT.  GM HAS BEEN LESS THAN HELPFUL IN CORRECTING THE OVERALL PROBLEMS AND LESS THAN FORTHCOMING ABOUT THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM.",
