DAY AFTER THE CLICKING, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON WHILE DRIVING 45 MPH. THE CAR WAS STILL ON BUT WITH NO ACCELERATION. PRESSING ON THE GAS PEDDLE WOULD REV THE ENGINE WITH NO PROGRESS. I  STOPPED THE CAR, TURNED IT OFF AND CHECKED MY FLUIDS UNDER THE HOOD. ALL LOOKED FINE. AFTER RESTARTING THE CAR, IT WOULD RUN THEN LOSE ACCELERATION AGAIN. CAR THEN BECAME UNRESPONSIVE AND TOWED TO THE DEALER. THE DEALER HAS HAD THE CAR FOR 2 DAYS AND STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT IS WRONG. SERVICE ADVISER SAID THE CAR IS NOT \"COMMUNICATING.\"  I AM CURRENTLY PAYING FOR A RENTAL OUT OF POCKET. FCA SAID THERE ARE NO RECALLS BASED ON MY VIN. BASED ON MY RESEARCH, IT SOUNDS LIKE THE P60/ALTERNATOR RECALL.",
