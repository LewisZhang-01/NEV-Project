        "summary": "I had been driving for roughly 4 hours when my sunroof exploded/shattered from the inside out.  I heard a loud noise and then the sound of the outside air.  I couldn't see a broken window.  I pulled off of Hwy 202 (Phoenix metro area) onto the next exit and got out and stepped up on my running board and saw that their was a large hole in the center of my sunroof glass.  There was no other damage that I could see to the roof.  When the damage occurred I had no other traffic around me and I there was not an overpass in sight, behind or in front of me.  My headliner was closed so no glass entered the cabin of the vehicle.  There was no damage to the headliner.  The claim has been reported to Toyota and also to my insurance company.  My passenger was my 15 year old foster son.  No one was injured in this event",
