I'M AWARE THAT WHEN THE DRIVER AND/OR PASSENGER SITS IN THE FRONT SEATS OF THE VEHICLE A SEAT BELT REMINDER SENSOR APPEARS. THIS SENSOR TRIGGERS A WARNING LIGHT AND AN AUDIBLE CHIME TO REMIND THE DRIVER AND/OR PASSENGER TO FASTEN THEIR SEAT BELT. HOWEVER, MY CAR ONLY REMINDS/CHIMES FOR THE DRIVER SEAT. THE SENSOR DOES NOT TRIGGER WHEN THERE IS AN OCCUPANT IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. I'M AWARE THAT OTHER LAND ROVER MAKES/MODELS HAVE HAD RECALLS DUE TO AIR BAG ISSUES. I'M CONCERNED THAT THE MAKE/MODEL OF MY CAR HAS THE SAME PROBLEM. IT'S NOW 5 YEARS SINCE I'VE PURCHASED MY VEHICLE (NEW) AND WITHIN THAT TIME THE BATTERY HAD TO BE REPLACED WITHIN 3 YEARS THEN BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT CALIPERS HAD TO BE REPLACED WITHIN 4 YEARS (PROBLEMS THAT I THOUGHT COULD/WOULD OCCUR AT LEAST AFTER 50,000 MILES). CURRENTLY, MY CAR HAS 42,634 MILES ON IT (ROUGHLY 8,500 MILES A YEAR DRIVING TO AND FROM WORK). MY CAR HISTORY WILL SHOW THAT I HAVE NOT BEEN IN ANY SEVERE ACCIDENTS OR IN ANY INCIDENT THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE AIRBAG WARNING INDICATOR LIGHT APPEARING. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THIS ISSUE IS IN FACT A RECALL OR WAS I JUST DEALT A LEMON?",
