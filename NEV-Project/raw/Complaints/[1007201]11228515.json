        "summary": "WATER PUMP BROKE WHILE ON HIGHWAY.  THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF FAILURE LEADING UP TO IT.  CAR GAVE A WARNING OF LOW OIL PRESSURE, THEN MAYBE 20 SECONDS LATER THE ENGINE COOLANT OVER TEMPERATURE WARNING COMES ON.  CAR STOPPED ACCELERATING AT THIS POINT, GOT TO SHOULDER OF HIGHWAY AND AT THIS POINT, POWER STEERING AND BRAKES WERE OUT.  ENGINE WAS SMOKING.  HAD IT TOWED BACK TO DEALERSHIP 89 MILES AWAY TO LEARN THE WATER PUMP BROKE CAUSING CATASTROPHIC ENGINE FAILURE AND DAMAGE.  ESTIMATE TO REBUILD ENGINE WAS $ 7352.00 PLUS TAX.      THERE WAS NO WARNING OR POSSIBLE WAY TO CHECK THE WATER PUMP BEFORE HAND.  I PURCHASED THE CAR IN 2011 AND HAD IT PAID OFF A COUPLE YEARS AGO.  NOW ALL EQUITY IN THE CAR IS COMPLETELY GONE AS THE CAR WAS ONLY WORTH 6-8K (ACCORDING TO TRUECAR) AND IT WOULD COST MORE TO FIX IT THAN TO PURCHASE A NEW ONE.      A ENGINE SWAP WAS ESTIMATED AT AROUND $4,000 WITH LABOR INCLUDED AS WELL.      AFTER THIS HAPPENED I FIND OUT I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THIS IS HAPPENING TO, AND THAT IT'S A MAJOR ISSUE THAT FORD HAS APPARENTLY TRIED TO KEEP QUIET.  I HOPE THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL PIECE OF AMMUNITION TO USE IN THE CASE AGAINST FORD.",
