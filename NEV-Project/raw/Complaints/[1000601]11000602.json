WHEN THE CAR IS ON A DOWNWARD BACKWARD SLOPE FACING UPHILL IT WILL ROLL BACKWARDS. THE DEALERSHIP STATED THAT LAND ROVER CHANGED THE SOFTWARE IN THE 2016 VEHICLE WHICH RESULTS IN THIS ISSUE. THIS ISSUE MAKES THE CAR INHERENTLY UNSAFE IN THESE SITUATIONS. JAGUAR/LAND ROVER DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THIS TO BE A FAULT BECAUSE IT WAS A SOFTWARE UPDATE AND IS, THEREFORE, PART OF THE OPERATION OF THIS MODEL.",
