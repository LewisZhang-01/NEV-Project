I TRIED TO LIFT THE SEAT UP AND I HEAD A POP SOUND AND I IMMEDIATELY SUNK INTO THE SEAT AND UNABLE TO SEE THE HOOD OF THE CAR BUT THE DASH. I MANAGED TO FIND THE NEAREST EXIT AND REALIZED THE MOTOR TO LIFT THE SEAT WAS ONLY LIFTING ONE SIDE OF THE SEAT. I COULD LIFT IT WITH MY HAND BUT FALLS ON THE FLOOR WHEN I LET IT GO. LUCKY NO CAR WAS IN FRONT OR CLOSELY BEHIND ME. I TRIED TO GET IT FIXED AND I HAVE AN INVOICE FOR OVER $1000. THAT IS NOT FAIR.",
