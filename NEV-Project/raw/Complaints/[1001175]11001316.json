I HAD TWO NEAR-COLLISIONS IN HEAVY TRAFFIC BECAUSE THE BRAKE PEDAL IS TOO CLOSE TO THE GAS-FEED PEDAL. I COMPLAINED TO THE DEALER SUGGESTING THE PEDALS NEED MORE SEPARATION. THAT FAILING, I SUGGESTED THE DEALER TAKE THE VEHICLE BACK. HE REFUSED BOTH REMEDIES. I LEFT THE CAR THERE AND WALKED HOME. I REFUSE TO DRIVE A DANGEROUS CAR.  I HAVE NO PHOTOS TO OFFER. THE DEALER HAS POSSESSION OF  IT. I SUPPOSE THE BRAKE/ACCELERATOR ALIGNMENT  IS PER DESIGN. I ADMIT I WEAR A SIZE 15 SHOE BUT THE SPACE FOR FEET OF MODERATE SIZE IS QUITE SMALL. I WAS WILLING TO LIVE WITH THE RESTRICTED SPACE - I DRIVE AN OLDER CR-V AND AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT. I ALMOST CRASHED IN HEAVY TRAFFIC BECAUSE THE BRAKE PEDAL OVERLAPS THE GAS PEDAL SPACE.   *JS    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
