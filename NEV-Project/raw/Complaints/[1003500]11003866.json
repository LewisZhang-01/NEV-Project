IT HAS DONE THIS MULTIPLE TIMES WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. THE FIRST TIME I WAS ABLE TO GET IT STARTED AGAIN BUT THEN THE SPEEDOMETER WOULDN'T WORK. AFTER THE FIRST TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS FIXED BUT NOW WHENEVER IT MALFUNCTIONS THE CAR SHUTS OFF ON ITS OWN AND WILL NOT START AGAIN UNTIL ITS BEEN SITTING UNTOUCHED FOR AT LEAST 10 MINUTES. THIS HAS HAPPENED IN TOWN (25 MPH) AND ON ROADS UP TO 55 MPHS.",
