AND IN 2015 I HAD TO PUT IT IN THE SHOP TO REPLACE THE THROTTLE CONTROL BODY BECAUSE I WAS LOSING ACCELERATION WHILE DRIVING. HERE WE ARE 1.5 YEARS LATER AND I AM HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM. ACCORDING TO THE MECHANIC THAT WAS WORKING ON MY CAR, AFTER 2 UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO FIX IT, THEY CONTACT A DODGE DEALERSHIP, WHICH STATED THIS WAS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE VEHICLE. AFTER DRIVING MY CAR FOR MORE THAN 10 MINUTES, THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE INDICATOR LIGHT BEGINS TO FLASH. I AM UNABLE TO ACCELERATE PAST 20 MPH. OR IF I AM STOPPED, THE CAR JERKS FORWARD WHILE TRYING TO ACCELERATE. THIS IS VERY UNSAFE ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY.",
