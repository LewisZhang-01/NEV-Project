I'VE TAKEN IT INTO THE DEALER MULTIPLE TIMES (AT LEAST 5 OR MORE TIMES, NOW I JUST LIVE WITH THE PROBLEM, SINCE IT'S NO LONGER UNDER WARRANTY).  THE FORD DEALERSHIP SAID THEY COULDN'T FIND ANY ISSUES.  ALL THEY DID, IS RECHARGE THE BATTERY A FEW TIMES AND EVENTUALLY, REPLACED THE BATTERY.  EVEN WITH THE NEWER BATTERY, IT STILL HAS THE SAME PROBLEM: DEAD BATTERY AFTER THREE DAYS.    IF I CHARGE THE BATTERY UP TO 100%, TWENTY-FOUR HOURS LATER, THE % RATE HAS DROPPED ABOUT 35%, DOWN TO LEVEL OF 65-67%.  IT'S DOWN THIS SINCE I BOUGHT THE CAR WHEN IT WAS NEW.  *TR",
