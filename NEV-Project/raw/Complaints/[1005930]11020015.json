I HAD TO IMMEDIATELY STEER IT TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  THERE WAS NO ROAD SHOULDER TO PULL OUT OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC. IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO USE THE HAZARD FLASHER TO WARN ONCOMING DRIVERS.  THE VEHICLE HAD NO LIGHTS. THE BACK HATCH/TAIL GATE WOULD NOT OPEN TO USE AS A VISUAL SIGNAL TO OTHER DRIVERS. IT WAS A POTENTIALLY VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION.  THANKFULLY A LARGE WRECKER PULLED UP BEHIND THE VEHICLE TO PREVENT US FROM BEING HIT AS WE COULD NOT BE READILY SEEN.  I USED MY CELL PHONE FLASHLIGHT TO SIGNAL ONCOMING TRAFFIC OF OUR LOCATION.",
