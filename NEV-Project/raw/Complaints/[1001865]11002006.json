I WAS DRIVING ON A WINDING ROAD AND MID SHARP TURN THE POWER STEERING FAILED AND I ALMOST LOST CONTROL AND CAME CLOSE TO CRASHING INTO THE TREE LINE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  I HAD STOP SINCE MY HEART WAS PALPITATING SO HARD.  I ALMOST CRASHED INTO THE TREE LINE AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY INJURED  OR WORSE.  LUCKILY MY INSTINCTS KICKED IN AND I WAS ABLE TO WITH ALL MY MIGHT SLOW DOWN THE CAR AND TURN THE WHEEL AS HARD AS I COULD TO AVOID CRASHING.  THIS IS REALLY DANGEROUS AND I AM LUCKY THAT I CAME AWAY UNSCATHED.  I TOOK MY CAR TO THE DEALER AND THEY TOLD ME THAT I NEEDED TO REPLACE THE WHOLE ELECTRONIC MODULE WHICH WILL COST APPROXIMATELY $1200 TO FIX/REPLACE.  THIS TYPE OF FAILURE IS VERY DANGEROUS AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT IT.",
