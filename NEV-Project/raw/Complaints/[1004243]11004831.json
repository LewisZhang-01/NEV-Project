WHOEVER WILL LISTEN AT NHTSA; I'D LIKE TO SHOW A PIC OF A SMALL KEVLAR 29 FILLED BLANKET I HAVE INSTALLED OVER MY CARS PASSENGER-SIDE AIR BAG.  SINCE FORD ISN'T DOING ANYTHING VERY SOON I FEEL THIS WILL HELP TOWARD REDUCING THE CHANCES OF A THROAT OR HEAD TRAUMA DURING DEPLOYMENT, CAN YOU GET THIS PICTURE TO ANYONE INTERESTED AS THERE'S MILLIONS WITH THIS RECALL IN LIMBO.  THE DRIVERS SIDE IS NOT RECALLED - YET, BUT SOMETHING SIMILAR COULD BE PRODUCED CHEAPLY.",
