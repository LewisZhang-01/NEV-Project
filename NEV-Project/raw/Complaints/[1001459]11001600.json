        "summary": "2014 JEEP CHEROKEE TRAILHAWK  9 SPD TRANSMISSION HAS BEEN REPROGRAMMED MULTIPLE TIMES AND TRANSMISSION REPLACED ONCE BY DEALER AND CHRYSLER - ALSO PAID $5000 FOR EXTENDED WARRANTY.  A DANGEROUS PROBLEM STILL EXISTS WITH NO RESOLUTION AT 45,000 MILES. NOTHING THE DEALER CAN DO TO KEEP TRANSMISSION FROM VIOLENT ACTIONS SHIFTING OR DELAYED FREEWHEELING SHIFTING WITH LOUD BANGING  LURCHES.THERE WERE TWO VERY DANGEROUS NEAR-WRECKS WHEN CAR JUST ROLLED OUT IN FRONT OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC BEFORE \"BANG-ACCELERATE\" - SEVERAL SECOND DELAY BEFORE TRANSMISSION SHIFTED. YIELD SIGNS ARE DANGEROUS IN TRAFFIC YOU HAVE TO COME TO A FULL STOP AND WAIT SEVERAL SECONDS, RISKING REAR-END COLLISIONS AND ANGRY HONKING FROM OTHERS COMING TO FAST STOPS. THE ALTERNATIVE IS TO PAUSE, THEN ACCELERATE WITH THE TRANSMISSION FREEWHEELING FOR A SECOND OR TWO BEFORE CATCHING AS IF YOU REVVED THE ENGINE AND THEN POPPED THE CLUTCH ON AN OLD STANDARD TRANSMISSION. THAT IS IF YOU ARE LUCKY, AND IT DOESN'T TAKE LONGER WHILE YOU ROLL OUT INTO TRAFFIC WITHOUT IT ACCELERATING. ALSO, MULTIPLE TIMES, IT FELT LIKE THE CAR BEING HIT WHEN I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE ACCELERATOR AND TAPPED BRAKE TO SLOW THEN ACCELERATE.THE TRANSMISSION FREE-WHEELED, THEN SHIFTED INTO AN UNKNOWN GEAR - SAME POP-THE-CLUTCH REACTION AS THE BRAKE IS RELEASED. IT ALSO DOES THESE THINGS OCCASIONALLY IN REVERSE PULLING OUT OF DRIVEWAY. THE TRANSMISSION DOESN'T SEEM TO EVER KNOW THE SPEED CHANGED WHILE IT WAS THINKING ABOUT WHICH GEAR IT SHOULD USE. I HAVE HAD TO DRIVE TO SPECIFICALLY AVOID SUCH INCIDENTS SINCE I'VE HAD THE CAR. EACH TIME IN,  THE DEALER SAYS IT  WAS DESIGNED THAT WAY AND WILL LEARN TO OPERATE BETTER AFTER A HUNDRED MILES OR SO - NOT. I'M PARKING IT UNTIL RESOLUTION, DRIVING 2007 KIA W/OVER 104,000 MILES. MUCH SAFER FOR THE GRAND-KIDS, WE TAKE CARE OF 40 HOURS A WEEK. ( 71 YEAR-OLD DISABLED/HANDICAPPED VET WITH DISABLED WIFE).",
