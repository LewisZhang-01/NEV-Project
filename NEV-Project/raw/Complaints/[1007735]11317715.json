MY CAR SUDDENLY SLAMMED ON THE BRAKES, FORCING IT TO MAKE A GRINDING SOUND, AND CAME TO AN ABRUPT STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION.   I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT WHEN I TOOK MY CAR TO A NISSAN DEALERSHIP A FEW DAYS AFTER THE INCIDENT TO FLASH THE ECU (WHAT I FOUND ONLINE AS THE SOLUTION PER NISSAN), THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THEY COULD NOT CORRECT THE ISSUE UNLESS THE ROGUE WAS CURRENTLY MALFUNCTIONING DESPITE NISSAN ISSUING A STATEMENT SAYING THEY HAD INFORMED ALL THEIR DEALERSHIPS OF THE ISSUE AND SOLUTION. I FOUND THIS EXTREMELY UNSAFE THAT THE DEALERSHIP WAS NOT WELL-INFORMED ON THIS SAFETY ISSUE. FORTUNATELY, I CONTACTED ANOTHER NISSAN DEALERSHIP WHO WAS INFORMED OF THE ISSUE AND WILL FLASH THE ECU.",
