HAD TO KEEP DRIVING WITH OUT POWER STEERING. IT HAS NOW BEEN OUT FOR 3 DAYS. FOUND OUT THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THIS ON THE 2011 FORD FUSION BUT MY VEHICLE IS NOT COVERED IN THIS RECALL. WHY NOT. SAME ISSUE AS RECALL. I AM VERY LUCKY I DIDN'T CRASH. FURTHER RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS MORE LIKE ME. FORD DOESN'T WANT TO PAY TO HAVE ALL VEHICLES WITH EPAS RECALLED. NOW THEY WANT TO STICK ME WITH THE BILL WHIS IS 1/4 OF THE VALUE OF THE CAR. THE VEHICLE WAS MAUFACTURED 07/10 AND HAS ONLY 37500 MILES.",
