I HAVE HAD TO REPLACE MANY OF THE PARTS IN THIS VEHICLE SEVERAL TIMES AND THEY ARE NOT CHEAP PARTS. AFTER MY LAST PART EPISODE, I DECIDED TO LOOK UP A COMMON THEME ONLINE; ONLY TO DISCOVER THERE ARE MANY OTHER CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE THE SAME ISSUES THAT I AM HAVING. HOWEVER, THE CRACKED DASHBOARD IS MORE SERIOUS BECAUSE IT HOUSES THE DEFECTED TAKATA AIRBAG THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE REPLACED. HOWEVER, NO ONE HAS CONTACTED ME ON REPLACING THAT ISSUE EITHER. THE DASH BOARD FIRST CRACKED IN JULY 2011 AND ANOTHER CRACKED OCCURRED IN JULY 2017. I USE A DASH COVER TO PROTECT MY VEHICLE FROM HEAT; HOWEVER, NOTHING SEEM TO STOP THE DASH FROM CRACKING AND THE INTERIOR PARTS FROM FALLING A PART.",
