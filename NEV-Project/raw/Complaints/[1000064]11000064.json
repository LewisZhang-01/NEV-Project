IF YOU PLACE A PURSE ON THE FLOOR GETS HOT ON THE BOTTOM OF PURSE CAN FEEL HEAT ON YOUR FEET ALSO BOTTOM OF SHOES GET HOT. EVERY SINCE I BOUGHT THE CARE. I TOLD FORD ABOUT IT AND THE DEALER SHIP AND GOT THE RESPONSE THAT MY VEHICLE AND  WAS NOT ONE OF THE ONES  LISTED IN THE VOLUNTARY RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM. HOWEVER SINCE I NOTICED THE PROBLEM AND IT CAUSED ME TO LOOK IT UP AND I FOUND THE FOLLOWING:  THERE HAS BEEN A VOLUNTARY RECALL ONLY TO PLACE NEW FUEL TANK SHIELD , NEW THERMAL WRAPPING IN THE FUEL VAPOR LINES AND NEW THERMAL WRAPPING ON THE PARKING BRAKE CABLE.       THE DEALERSHIP RESPONSE WAS STILL THE SAME. I FEEL AS A CUSTOMER I SHOULD BE RIGHT AND THEY SHOULD TO THE RECALL REPLACEMENTS. IF I DID NOT FEEL THE HEAT COMING OFF OF THE FLOOR BOARDS  I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN THERE WAS A VOLUNTARY RECALL FOR IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.     WHAT SHOULD I DO?",
