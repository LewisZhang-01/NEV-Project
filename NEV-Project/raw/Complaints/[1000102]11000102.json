LAST THURSDAY 6/15 AT 5:15 I WAS ABOUT TO MERGE INTO AN EMPTY MERGE LANE WHEN I THOUGHT WE WERE HIT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE.  THE DRIVER SIDE CURTAIN AIR BAG HAD DEPLOYED.  IMMEDIATELY PULLING OVER AND VACATING ALL FROM THE SUV I CHECKED THE EXTERIOR DAMAGE AND FOUND NONE.    HAD JUST COME AROUND A SLOW CURVE AND WAS DRIVING STRAIGHT WITH ALL THE WINDOWS OPEN, I WAS ACCELERATING FROM 25 TO GET UP TO 50 WHEN WE FELT THE EXPLOSION.  HUMIDITY WAS ABOUT 80%.  I AM ON BLOOD THINNERS AND MY DOCTOR IS WATCHING FOR SIGNS OF A BRAIN BLEED.  MY LEFT ARM WAS BRUISED BEHIND THE ELBOW AND MY FOREARM HAD A 1ST DEGREE BURN.  34008 MILES    ARE THERE OTHER INSTANCES OF PATHFINDER AIR BAGS DEPLOYING ON THEIR OWN.",
