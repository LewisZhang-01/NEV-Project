I HAVE TALKED TO A DEALERSHIP LATELY ABOUT HOW I CAN MAINTAIN MY TRANSMISSION TO AVOID THE PROBLEM HE TOLD ME TO CHANGE THE FLUID AFTER 60K MILES. WHICH I DID RIGHT AWAY BECAUSE I WAS THE SECOND OWNER. I'M SUPPRISE AT 127K MILES, MY TRANSMISSION BROKEN DOWN. AND ALL MECHANICS I BE BEEN TO TELL ME IS A FACTORY ISSUE AND NISSAN KNOWS IT. THEY SAID THE CVT TRANSMISSION MOSTLY COME TO FAIL ON THAT NISSAN AFTER YOU PASS THE 100K MILES. (FACTORY ISSUE WITH THAT CVT TECHNOLOGY THEY SAID). I CALL NISSAN TO SUBMIT THE PROBLEM, BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY TOLD THEY CAN'T DO NOTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE OF THE HIGH MILEAGE. THE BAD TRANSMISSION IS VERY DANGEROUS ON THE PUBLIC ROAD, I HAVE BEEN IN THE SITUATION ON THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY WHERE I COULDN'T PASS THE 18 WHEELER AND ALMOST CAUSE A CRASH BECAUSE THE TRANSMISSION IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY.",
