THEN MIRACULOUSLY THEY FOUND AN ISSUE WHICH WAS NOW A $3000 FIX. I TOOK IT FOR A 2ND OPINION TO ANOTHER VW DEALER AND WAS TOLD THE TURBO DIDN'T NOT NEED TO BE REPLACED. NOW MY CAR IS COMPLETE FAILURE DUE TO THE TIMING CHAIN SKIPPING AND ALSO FIRED ALL THE PISTONS AT ONCE. NOW IT'S A $7500 REPAIR TO FIX THE TURBO AND THE ENGINE. NO WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON; NO OIL LIGHT; NO ISSUES DRIVING IT. IT WORKED PERFECTLY UNTIL I TRIED TO START IT TO LEAVE. NEITHER ONE OF THE DEALERS WILL ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY AND VW OF AMERICA REFUSED TO HELP WITH THIS 'WARRANTY ISSUE'.    (I HAVE MY ENTIRE SERVICE RECORD)",
