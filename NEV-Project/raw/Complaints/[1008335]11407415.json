TOOK IT TO A GARAGE AND HAD THEM SCAN AND IT SEEMS TO BE ABS RELATED. STILL HAVE NO REPAIRED BUT FROM READING ALL OVER FORUMS, REDDIT, GOOGLE SEARCHES, AND MORE THIS SEEMS TO BE AN EXTREMELY COMMON PROBLEM THAT COSTS A TON TO REPAIR. FORD SHOULD HANDLE THIS AS A RECALL IF IT IS A REGULAR ISSUE WITH THIS MAKE AND MODEL.    HOW IS THERE NO CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT YET? IT SEEMS COUNTLESS PEOPLE ARE MENTIONING THAT THE BRAKES OUTRIGHT FAILED WHILE DRIVING ON THE ROAD OR EVEN HIGHWAYS. WHAT IF SOMEONE DIES? THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.",
