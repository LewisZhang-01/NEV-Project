I NEED THE CRUISE CONTROL AND HAVE DISCOVERED THAT IF I PULL OVER, TURN THE CAR OFF, THEN TURN IT ON AGAIN THE CRUISE CONTROL WILL FUNCTION AGAIN.  PULLING OFF ON THE SIDE OF AN INTERSTATE OR EXIT RAMP IS HAZARDOUS.  APPARENTLY SOME PEOPLE ARE PUTTING THEIR CAR IN NEUTRAL WHILE STILL DRIVING ON INTERSTATES, TURNING THE CAR OFF, THEN ON AGAIN.",
