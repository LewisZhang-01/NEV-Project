WHEN THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN ON THE ROAD FOR A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME IT WILL DO THE SAME IN AN UPWARDS OF 50 MILES AN HOUR ON THE HIGHWAY SHUDDERING AT DIFFERENT TIMES. I AM UNSURE WHAT CAUSED THIS PROBLEM, I JUST BOUGHT THE CAR BACK IN NOVEMBER 2018 WITH 42K MILES ON IT. I HAVEN'T EVEN PUT 10K MILES ON THIS VEHICLE AND IT IS ACTING STRANGELY. ANOTHER ISSUE WITH THIS CAR IS THE ABS AND STABILITY CONTROL SENSOR KEEPS MALFUNCTIONING. IT KEEPS COMING LOOSE FROM THE SENSOR THAT CONNECTS TO THE TIRE AND UNFORTUNATELY MOST PEOPLE ARE TOLD THEIR ABS SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE REPLACED AND THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. I THINK THE SHUDDER/LAG ISSUE SHOULD BE LISTED AS A RECALL FOR MY VEHICLE AND A BROADER RANGE OF OTHER JEEPS BECAUSE THIS SEEMS TO BE A STANDARD ISSUE WITH JEEP PATRIOTS 2016 MODELS.",
