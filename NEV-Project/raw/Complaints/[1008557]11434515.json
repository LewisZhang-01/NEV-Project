        "summary": "Component that has failed is the Uconnect system.  It control GPS, phone, radio, temperature settings, doors, etc. My safety has been put at risk for various reasons; the phone inexplicably will start dialing different people over and over without my prompting and I have to do my best to cancel each if they calls while driving.  When I pulled over on the Hwy to avoid more distractions, It took several attempts to move to another mode to get it to stop.  After exiting the vehicle to regain my composure, the vehicle locked me out while running leaving me stranded on the side of the Hwy until a locksmith was summoned for me by a concerned motorist.  Also while driving, the heat would inadvertently switch to highest heat possible and seat warmers would kick on even though the temp had been set previously at 70 degrees.  Mind you, outside temperature was 100 degrees.  Problem had been reproduced and had been acknowledged by the dealer and Chrysler.  Dealer and online blogs both stated it\u2019s a known problem with many vehicles with this Uconnect device.  Problem original started with radio stations switching on their own and has recently progressed to all systems controlled by this devise radically changing while in motion.",
