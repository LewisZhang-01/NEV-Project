AFTER THE MECHANIC CHECKED HE CONFIRMED IT WAS THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD. I WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE WRITER THAT THERE WAS A BROKEN BOLT AND AN EXHAUST LEAK ON BOTH SIDES. I CALLED FIAT CHRYSLER AMERICA AND THEY CONTACTED THE SERVICE WRITER AT THE DEALERSHIP. AFTER THE REPRESENTATIVE SPOKE TO THE SERVICE WRITER SHE TOLD ME I SHOULD PAY THE $423 (APPROX) COST TO HAVE IT REPAIRED SINCE THIS WAS NOT COVERED UNDER ANY OTHER RECOURSE. I WAS SURPRISED THAT AFTER I EXPLAINED THAT THE SERVICE WRITER SAID THIS WAS HAPPENING ON ALL RAM TRUCKS THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY RESPONSE OTHER THAN SAYING IT WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY. THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A BROKEN BOLT AND THE SERVICE WRITER SAID IT WAS ON ALL RAM TRUCKS THAT THEY SHOULD ADDRESS IT DUE TO DEFECTIVE MATERIALS. I JUST WANT THEM TO ACCEPT THAT IT IS DEFECTIVE MATERIALS AND FIX THIS ISSUE.",
