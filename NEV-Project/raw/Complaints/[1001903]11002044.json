CRUISE CONTROL WILL NOT WORK WHEN THIS HAPPENS. AFTER A FEW DAYS, CORRECTS ITSELF AND IS OK FOR A DAY OR SO BUT CONTINUES AGAIN. VERY CONCERNING IN TRAFFIC. CLUTCH WENT ALL THE WAY TO FLOOR, TOOK TO DEALERSHIP AND SO FAR NOT REOCCURRING (RECALL).  ELECTRICAL ISSUE, POSSIBLE SOMETHING STAYING OPEN, DRAINING BATTERY. AFTER SITTING ALL DAY, CAR WOULD NOT UNLOCK, HAD TO ENTER CAR WITH ACTUAL MANUAL UNLOCK. UPON OPENING, THE DASH LIGHTS WERE ALL FLASHING, THE DISPLAY SCREEN WAS FLASHING UNREADABLE IMAGES. ALL INSTRUMENT PANEL LIGHTS CAME ON, STAYED ON. WHEN DOOR SHUT, PANEL LIGHTS WENT OFF AND THE FUEL AND SPEEDOMETER GAUGES STARTING JUMPING, OPENED THE DOOR, GAUGES STOPPED AND LIGHTS CAME ON. WIPER BLADES ACTIVATED ON THEIR OWN, VERY SLOWLY. COULD NOT UNLOCK ANY DOOR OR OPEN TRUNK DURING THIS TIME. JUMPED THE CAR, STARTED VERY QUICKLY. WILL NEED TO REPLACE THE BATTERY AS IT IS NOT CHARGING FULLY.  REAR BRAKES ARE NOT WEARING PROPERLY..  CAR MILEAGE  35,500..   VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS CAR'S PERFORMANCE.",
