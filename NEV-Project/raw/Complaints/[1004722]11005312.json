SINCE WE WERE UNABLE TO GET THE TRUCK TO THE DEALER ( THE TRUCK IS STILL  UNDER WARRANTY). WE HAD THE SHOP REPLACE THE FAULTY CALIPER. SO WE COULD GET THE TRUCK BACK ON THE ROAD.  NOW I NEED TO KNOW WHY THIS IS NOT A RECALL \"BRAKES\" ARE CERTAINLY A SAFETY ISSUE!  AND HOW DO I GO ABOUT TRYING TO GET REIMBURSED FOR THE CHARGES FOR THIS?",
