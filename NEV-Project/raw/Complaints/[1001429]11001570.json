        "summary": "MY 2003 MERCEDES BENZ CLK 320 THAT I HAVE OWNED FOR LESS THAN 1 YEAR CAUGHT ON FIRE ON JUNE 9, 2017. THE ENGINE IS MELTED AND DESTROYED LUCKILY NO ONE WAS INJURED DESPITE IT HAPPENED AROUND A BUSY AREA.  I  AM COMPLETELY IN SHOCK STILL, NOT KNOWING WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED UNTIL I CAME ACROSS A WEBSITE STATING THAT OTHER MERCEDES BENZ MODELS  HAVE HAD THEIR ENGINES CATCH ON FIRE DUE TO TRYING TO START THE VEHICLE MORE THAN ONCE IN CONSECUTIVE ATTEMPTS. (WHILE READING THAT LAST PARAGRAPH, I DO RECALL TRYING TO DO JUST THAT SINCE THE CAR DECIDED TO STALL ON ME).  I REMEMBER I WAS WAITING AT AN INTERSECTION TO MAKE A TURN INTO A U.S. POST OFFICE PARKING LOT AREA. HOWEVER, BEFORE I COULD EVEN MAKE THE TURN, IT STALLED ON ME IN THE INTERSECTION. I IMMEDIATELY TRIED TO START IT AS PEOPLE BEGAN HONKING THEIR  HORNS AT ME WITHOUT ANY LUCK. ON THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE TRY I GOT THE CAR STARTED AND DROVE AND PARKED IN THE PARKING LOT.  I DID NOT GIVE A THOUGHT OF WHY THE MERCEDES GAVE ME STARTING PROBLEMS JUST A MINUTE AGO AS I GRABBED MY PURSE AND HEADED TO THE POST OFFICE. WHILE I GOT IN LINE,I STARTED TO HEAR PEOPLE YELL ABOUT A FIRE-A CAR FIRE. WE ALL WENT OUTSIDE TO SEE THIS AND AS I GOT A GOOD LOOK AT IT, I REALIZED THAT WAS MY CAR ON FIRE. I CALLED 911 WHILE I WAS SHAKING.",
