        "summary": "ON JULY 10, 2017 I WAS PROCEEDING WITHIN THE SPEED LIMIT ON A CITY STREET.  I NOTICED A LINE OF STOPPED CARS SOME DISTANCE AHEAD OF ME.  I ATTEMPTED TO APPLY MY BRAKES, BUT IT SOON BECAME EVIDENT THAT THAT THEY WERE NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.  THUS, MY RATE OF SPEED WAS NOT BEING SUFFICIENTLY REDUCED.  I PUMPED THE BRAKES, BUT TO NO AVAIL.   I THEN APPLIED A GREAT DEAL OF PRESSURE TO THE BRAKE PEDAL, BUT IT MEEKLY SUNK TO THE FLOOR.  BY THE TIME I WENT FOR THE EMERGENCY BRAKE, AND I COLLIDED WITH THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME AT A LOW RATE OF SPEED.  FORTUNATELY, THE OTHER DRIVER AND MYSELF WERE UNHARMED, AND THE DAMAGE TO OUR VEHICLES WAS MINIMAL.    I HAD MY CAR TOWED TO A MECHANIC, AND THEY INSPECTED MY BRAKING SYSTEM.  THEY NOTICED SEVERE CORROSION ON THE REAR BRAKE LINES, TO THE POINT THAT THERE WAS SERIOUS LEAKING.     I HAD MY FRONT BRAKE LINES PATCHED IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR DUE TO CORROSION.  IN THAT INSTANCE, I WAS FORTUNATE THAT MY INSTRUMENT PANEL ALERTED ME TO LOW BRAKE FLUID LEVELS.  I WAS NOT SO LUCKY THIS TIME AROUND.  I HAVE SPOKEN WITH SEVERAL MECHANICS AND READ VARIOUS OTHER PROFESSIONAL OPINIONS ONLINE ABOUT THIS ERA (2007) OF FORD'S BRAKE LINES.  FROM THIS INFORMATION,  I HAVE GLEANED THAT THERE ARE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE CORROSION OF BRAKE LINES.  I LIVE IN A MILD CLIMATE WHERE THE ROADS ARE RARELY SALTED, AND YET I HAVE HAD THE AFOREMENTIONED EXPERIENCES.  PLEASE DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO REMEDY THIS ISSUE:  IT MAY VERY WELL SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE.",
