        "summary": "THE TOUCHSCREEN ON MY CAR HAS PERMANENTLY TURNED BLACK THEREFORE I HAVE LOST THE REAR CAMERA IMAGE DISPLAY WHEN REVERSE GEAR IS SELECTED. AS A RESULT, I ALMOST RAN INTO A SHOPPING CART WHILE I WAS BACKING UP YESTERDAY.  WHAT IS FRIGHTENING IS THAT NEXT TIME, IT COULD BE A SMALL CHILD THAT I DON'T SEE AND RUN OVER. THE FAILED TOUCHSCREEN ALSO MEANS I NO LONGER HAVE FAN OR AIR CONDITIONING WHICH MEANS I HAVE TO DRIVE WITH MY WINDOWS DOWN, EVEN WHEN ON A HIGHWAY. IN THIS TIME OF COVID, I WAS TERRIFIED WHEN A HOMELESS MAN PUT HIS HEAD THROUGH MY WINDOW TO ASK FOR MONEY WHILE POSSIBLY CONTAMINATING ME WITH A VIRUS YESTERDAY. IT JUST IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE AROUND WITH THE WINDOWS DOWN IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS. ALSO THERE ARE DAYS IN THE BAY AREA WHEN THERE IS A HIGH POLLUTION INDEX, I DO NOT WISH TO BREATHE UNFILTERED AIR BECAUSE I HAVE TO OPEN THE WINDOW BECAUSE THE FAN CANNOT BE TURNED ON. ACCORDING TO THE TESLA REPAIR SHOP, THE FAILED TOUCHSCREEN IS A COMMON PROBLEM ON THE OLDER MODEL S THAT REQUIRES OWNERS TO SHELL OUT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO REPLACE AN MCU THAT HAS FAILED PREMATURELY.  I DO NOT FEEL I SHOULD BE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MCU REPLACEMENT AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE A PRODUCT RECALL.",
