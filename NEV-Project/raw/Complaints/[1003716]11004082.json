I STILL HAD POWER TO THE RADIO AND LIGHTS BUT THE CAR WENT LIMP. I WAS BARLEY ABLE TO TURN IT INTO A PARKING LOT FOR SAFETY BECAUSE THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED UP.  I TURNED OFF THE CAR WAITED A  FEW MINUTES AND STARTED IT BACK UP WITH NO PROBLEMS.  I AM LUCKY I WASN'T IN TRAFFIC, BECAUSE THIS WOULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT, IT WENT FROM 45 MPH TO  NOTHING IN SECONDS.",
