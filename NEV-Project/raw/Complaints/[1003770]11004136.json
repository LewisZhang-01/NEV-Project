PROBLEM SEEMS MOST PRESENT AT AROUND 2000 RPM WHILE ATTEMPTING TO INCREASE SPEED.  IT APPEARS THAT THIS PROBLEM IS OCCURRING WHEN THE TURBO BOOST IS INCREASED. RESEARCH OF THIS PROBLEM HAS SHOWN THAT MANY OWNERS ARE EXPERIENCING THIS SAME PROBLEM WITH THE ECO BOOST ENGINE IN THIS AND OTHER YEAR MODELS.  THE NHTSA BEGAN AN INVESTIGATION IN 2012 BUT DROPPED THE PROBE WHEN FORD SAID THEY HAD RESOLVED THIS ISSUE.  NO RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR THIS PROBLEM BUT IT IS DEFINITELY A \"SAFETY ISSUE\" FOR DRIVERS OF THIS EQUIPMENT.  HEADED FOR THE FORD DEALERSHIP TOMORROW TO SEE HOW THIS CAN BE RESOLVED.",
