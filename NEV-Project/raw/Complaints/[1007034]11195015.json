        "summary": "I HAVE HAD TO BRAKE QUICKLY ON 2 OCCASIONS AND 1 OF THE TIMES I HAD TO SLAM ON MY BRAKES AS A CAR RAN A STOP SIGN COMING OFF THE HIGHWAY. THE PEDAL WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR,  I HAD TO SWERVE INTO THE OTHER LANE TO AVOID HITTING THE CAR AND BARELY WAS ABLE TO STOP MY CAR.  THE SECOND TIME I HAD TO STOP QUICKLY AND BRAKE GRINDED TO A STOP IN HEAVY TRAFFIC AND A CITY STREET. BOTH TIME THE PEDAL WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR. DURING MY NEW YORK STATE INSPECTION DID NOT PASS DUE TO A SOFT BRAKE PEDAL,  I HAD THE BACK BRAKES REPLACED AND THEY DISCOVERED THE MASTER CYLINDER HAD A LEAK. I HAD IT REPLACED AS WELL AND THE BRAKES STILL ARE NOT WORKING PROPERLY. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT THIS SATURDAY TO HAVE THE LONG PINS (I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED) REPLACED ON THE BACK BRAKES. THEY ALSO SAID IT'S POSSIBLE I WILL NEED TO HAVE THE POWER BRAKE BOOSTER REPLACED.  AFTER SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS AND 4 SATURDAY'S SPENT AT THE CAR REPAIR STORE AND STILL NOT RESOLUTION TO THE BRAKE PROBLEM. I'VE READ MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SAME ISSUES ON THE SAME YEAR, MAKE AND MODEL CAR MAYBE IT'S TIME TO ISSUE A RECALL BEFORE IT COSTS SOMEONE THEIR LIFE.",
