NOTIFIED DEALERSHIP WHO SUGGESTED BALANCING TIRES, ROAD FORCING TIRES, ETC BEFORE BRINGING IT IN FOR WARRANTY SERVICE. TOOK THE TRUCK TO SEVERAL TIRE SHOPS TO HAVE THE TIRES BALANCED, ROAD FORCED, CHANGED OUT FOR DIFFERENT TIRES, ETC.  NOTHING RELATED TO TIRES \"FIXED\" THE ISSUE.      BROUGHT TRUCK BACK TO DEALER FOR WARRANTY SERVICE, THEY REPLACED TWO TIRES THAT WERE (SUPPOSEDLY) \"BAD\" AND RETURNED THE TRUCK TO ME.  ISSUE WAS NOT RESOLVED.  RETURNED THE TRUCK FOR WARRANTY SERVICE AND REPORTED THE ISSUE TO FIAT CHRYSLER THE DEALERSHIP CHANGED OUT THE DRIVE SHAFT AND RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO ME INDICATING THAT THERE WAS NOTHING MORE THEY COULD DO AND THAT ANY REMAINING VIBRATION COULD NOT BE \"FIXED.\"  DROVE THE TRUCK HOME AND FELT THE VIBRATION.  CONTINUED DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS INCREASES THE VIBRATION.      ONLY WAY TO \"ELIMINATE\" THE VIBRATION IS TO DRIVE AT 10 MILES BELOW OR ABOVE THE SPEED LIMIT ON THE INTERSTATE (NEITHER OF WHICH IS SAFE, IN MY OPINION).",
