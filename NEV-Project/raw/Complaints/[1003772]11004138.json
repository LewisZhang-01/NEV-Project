I CAN NOT UNDERSTAND WHY YOUR DEPARTMENT ENFORCED TO REPLACE SO MANY JEEP IGNITION SWITCH'S TO NOT THINK THEY DID NOT HAVE INFERIOR PRODUCTS ON THE LIBERTY'S AS WELL. THE KEYS SLIDE RIGHT OUT OF THE IGNITION RATHER THE VEHICLE IS IN DRIVE MOTION OR PARKED, ON OR OFF, DOESN'T MATTER AND THERE ARE COMPLAINTS ALL OVER THE WEB AS TO SAME ISSUE. I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE NEEDS TO BE REPORTED TO YOU TO MAKE OFFICIAL, HOWEVER, CHRYSLER'S LACK OF COOPERATIVENESS ALONE, I WOULD THINK ENOUGH TO BE DUE CAUSE TO UMBRELLA JEEPS OF ALL MODELS AND GET THEM ALL ENFORCED AROUND THE SAME TIME FRAME.",
