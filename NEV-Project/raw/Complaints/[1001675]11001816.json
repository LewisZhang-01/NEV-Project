THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY RISK FOR OUR FAMILY.  WE BOUGHT THE VEHICLE AS A CERTIFIED FORD, BUT THE RECALL HADN'T BEEN ADDRESSED.  TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM, WE BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO ANOTHER FORD DEALER.  THE DEALER SAID THEY MADE THE REPAIR SPECIFIED IN RECALL NOTICE (CONTROL MODULE REPROGRAMMING), BUT THAT DIDN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM: THE INTERMITTENT LOSS OF TRANSMISSION OUTPUT CONTINUES.  NOW THE RECALL NOTICE HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM OUR RECORD AND THE RECALL NOTICE IS NO LONGER ASSOCIATED WITH VIN.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.  WE NEED THIS TO BE REPAIRED!",
