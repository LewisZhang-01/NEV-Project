WHILE TRAVELING TO VISIT FAMILY FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY, 1 OF THE TIRES,MOUNTED ON THE FRONT, HAD A IT TREAD SEPARATION WHILE DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY. ALTHOUGH THE DEALER SAID THERE WAS NO WARRANTY ON THE TIRE, WHICH I AM OK WITH, I FEEL THAT THE BRAND OF TIRE MAY HAVE TO BE RECALLED BECAUSE WITH TODAY'S ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.  YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS  MATTER ARE APPRECIATED .    THANK YOU    [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
