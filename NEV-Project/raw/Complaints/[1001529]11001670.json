I MANAGED TO COMPLETE THE TURN WITHOUT THE POWER STEERING. I TOOK THE CAR TO MY LOCAL REPAIR SHOP WHO INFORMED ME THAT THE POWER STEERING PUMP HAD FAILED AND THAT THERE WAS ALSO A LEAK IN THE STEERING RACK. THEY ADVISED ME TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER AS IT WAS A KNOWN FAULT AND SHOULD BE REPAIRED FOR FREE.  I TOOK IT TO THE CHEVY DEALER WHO SAID THAT AS THERE WAS A LEAK IT WAS NOT COVERED BY GENERAL MOTORS AS THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR. THERE WAS NO MENTION OF THE STEERING PUMP BY THE DEALER. IF IT IS A KNOWN FAULT GM AND DEALERS SHOULD DO A RECALL BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED.",
