SHE HAD THE AIRBAG RECALL REPAIRED ON 6/24/17 BUT AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT IS STILL ON.  THE DEALER STATES THERE IS A \"FRONT WEIGHT SENSOR FAILURE\" AND NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED FOR COST OF $882.32.  HONDA INDICATES THIS PART IS NOT PART OF THE RECALL AND WILL NOT PAY FOR REPAIRS. I BELIEVE THE AIRBAGS SHOUD BE FUNCTIONAL AFTER THE RECALL REAIR WAS COMPLETED.",
