        "summary": "JUNE 23 2017, I WAS TRAVELING DOWN THE ROAD WHEN A MESSAGE THE READ STOP WHEN SAFE POPPED ONTO THE TRUCK INSTRUMENT DISPLAY. I ATTEMPTED TO GET TO A SAFE AREA TO PULL THE TRUCK OVER BUT WAS UNABLE DUE TO A LOSS IN MOMENTUM THAT I LATER FOUND OUT WAS A MANUFACTURER SAFETY PRECAUTION DUE TO A FAULTY EGT SENSOR. I WAS NOW CURRENTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND UNABLE TO RESTART THE TRUCK. AFTER 20 MINUTES WAVING DOWN VEHICLES SO THAT A SERIOUS ACCIDENT DID NOT HAPPEN THE TRUCK RESTARTED. I SENT BACK DOWN THE ROAD TO ATTEMPT TO GET INTO A SAFER LOCATION INSTEAD OF BLOCKING 1 LANE OF THE ROAD. I WAS ABLE TO PROCEED .9 MILES BEFORE THE TRUCK SHUT OFF AGAIN ON A BLIND HILL. THE TOW TRUCK WAS ARRIVED AND WE WERE THEN ABLE TO REMOVE IT FROM THE ROADWAY. FORD HAS COME OUT WITH A RECALL FOR THERE 6.7L POWER STROKE AMBULANCES TO NOT HAVE THIS ISSUE BUT AS CIVILIANS WE ARE STUCK WITH A VERY DANGEROUS AND POSSIBLY LIFE THREATENING SHUT DOWN OF THE TRUCK OVER A 57 DOLLAR PART. THIS IS NOT A SMALL INSTANCE ON THIS HAPPENING JUST A QUICK ONLINE SEARCH WILL SHOW COUNTLESS OTHERS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. FORTUNATELY NO ONE WAS HURT BECAUSE OF THE MEASURES TAKEN OF THE PEOPLE OR THE ROAD. THIS IS NOT RIGHT AND FORD NEEDS TO MAKE A CHANGE. IF YOU LOOK INTO THE BACKGROUND OF THIS TRUCK YOU WILL SEE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME OF SUCH THINGS HAPPENING.",
