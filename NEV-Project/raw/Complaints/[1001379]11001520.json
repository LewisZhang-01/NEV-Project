        "summary": "I BOUGHT NISSAN ROGUE 2010 WITH A CLEAN TITLE  IN DECEMBER OF 2013. I STARTED HAVING SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH MY CAR IN THE SPRING OF 2014. I BEGAN HEARING A WHINING SOUND ON ACCELERATION COMING FROM THE TRANSMISSION WHILE DRIVING ON LONG ROAD TRIPS. I DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT UP UNTIL A YEAR LATER,  WAS SUDDENLY UNABLE TO ACCELERATE WHEN GOING UP HILL OR DRIVING LONGER THAN 20 MILES. THE PEDAL WAS DOWN TO THE FLOOR BUT RATHER THAN PICK UP SPEED, THE VEHICLE WOULD DECELERATE AND WAS UNABLE TO REACH EVEN 40 MPH. IT STARTED HAPPENING MORE AND MORE OFTEN, AND I ALMOST GOT INTO A CAR ACCIDENT SEVERAL TIMES. I WENT TO DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS AND FOUND OUT THAT NISSAN WAS AWARE OF THE PROBLEM WITH THEIR CVTS AND THAT THEY EXTENDED THE WARRANTY TO 10 YEARS/120,000 MPH. HOWEVER, THEY WERE REFUSING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO WAY TO DUPLICATE IT SINCE IT WOULD TAKE SEVERAL MILES OF DRIVING AROUND TO NOTICE ACCELERATION FAILURE. THE WHINING SOUND AND VIBRATION ARE NORMAL I WAS TOLD.  AFTER GOING TO DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS MULTIPLE TIMES AND TALKING WITH NISSAN CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES, IN DECEMBER 2016 I WAS FINALLY TOLD THAT THERE'S NO EXTENDED WARRANTY ON MY VEHICLE BECAUSE NISSAN CANCELED MY CAR'S WARRANTY BACK IN 2014 BECAUSE OF A BRANDED TITLE. I CALLED DOL AND FOUND OUT THERE WAS A MISTAKE DONE. THEY FIXED MY TITLE AND THERE'S NO BRAND ON IT.  NOW I GOT A CALL FROM A NISSAN CUSTOMER AFFAIR REP MR DARIES WHO INFORMED ME THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON GETTING THE BRAND OFF OF MY TITLE AND IT SHOULD TAKE 4-6 WEEKS BUT THEY ARE TRYING TO EXPEDITE IT. HE PROMISED HE WOULD CALL ME REGULARLY WITH AN UPDATE. IT'S BEEN ALMOST TWO MONTHS AND NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE. I CALLED SEVERAL TIMES LEAVING VOICEMAIL TO MR DARIES AND NEVER GOT A CALL BACK FROM HIM.  I CAN'T EVEN DRIVE LONGER THAN 10 MILES WHEN MY CAR STARTS LOSING ACCELERATION AND HAS THIS HORRIBLE WHINING NOISE.",
