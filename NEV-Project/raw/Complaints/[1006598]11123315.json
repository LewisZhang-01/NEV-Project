THEY CAN BE SEEN STRADDLING THREADS OF A BOLT TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF THE ATTACHED PHOTO. I CONTACTED SUBARU OF AMERICA (SOA) AND THEY CLAIM THEY HAVEN'T HEARD OF THIS ISSUE DESPITE THE RELATIVELY LARGE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FILED WITH NHTSA FOR 2010 FORESTERS. ADDITIONALLY, NO RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED AND THERE WAS NO OFFER FROM SOA TO MAKE A GOOD WILL REPAIR AT NO CHARGE TO THE CUSTOMER. IT WOULD SEEM THIS WOULD BE CONSIDERED A SAFETY ISSUE SINCE IT DIRECTLY INVOLVES THE DRIVER'S SEAT. I FIRST NOTICED ISSUE WHILE I WAS DRIVING AND COULDN'T ADJUST MY SEAT PROPERLY.",
