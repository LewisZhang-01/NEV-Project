AFTER DROPPING OFF THE CAR THEY SAID SERVICE WAS COMPLETE.  I ALSO HAVE BEEN HAVING AN ISSUE WITH THE MCU AND THEY SAID THEY RAN A DIAGNOSTIC BUT COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG.  WHEN THEY SAID SERVICE WAS COMPLETE I CAME TO PICK UP MY CAR. THEY GAVE IT BACK BUT WHEN I SAW THE INVOICE I NOTICED THEY HADN'T COMPLETED THE STEERING BOLT RECALL. I ASKED WHY AND THEY STATED THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS AN AFTERMARKET STEREO AMPLIFIER IN THE FRUNK THEY COULDN'T ACCESS THE BOLTS TO REPLACE THEM. IF I HADN'T INQUIRED OR LOOKED AT THE PAPERWORK I WOULD HAVE ASSUMED THE REPAIR WAS COMPLETED.  I AM THERE ASKING FOR PAPERWORK FROM MY SERVICE ADVISOR 'MATT' WHO HAS BEEN COMPLETELY UNHELPFUL IN RESOLVING THE ISSUE.",
