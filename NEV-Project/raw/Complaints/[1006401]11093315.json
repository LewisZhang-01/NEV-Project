WHEN TOLD BY COLLISION SHOP THE VEHICLE WAS FINISHED AND UPON COMING IN TO PICK UP THE VEHICLE, OBVIOUS STRUCTURAL DAMAGE REMAINED UNTOUCHED, AND UNREPAIRED ENGINE DAMAGE WAS OBVIOUS.  COLLISION SHOP AND INSURANCE COMPANY INSISTED VEHICLE REPAIRS WERE COMPLETE AND FOUGHT ME TO TAKE THE VEHICLE TO THE HONDA DEALERSHIP FOR DIAGNOSTIC. WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS FINALLY TAKEN, THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON AND A DTC CODE WAS THRON. ADDITIONAL ISSUES WITH THE INTEGRITY OF THE VEHICLE POST COLLISION WERE NOTED AND BOTH COLLISION SHOP AND INSURANCE COMPANY REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE SAFETY ISSUES AND REPAIR THE VEHICLE TO SAFETY STANDARDS. NEITHER THE COLLISION SHOP NOR THE INSURANCE COMPANY IS FAMILIAR WITH THE NEW 2016 CIVIC BODY, DIAGNOSTICS, CRASH ZONES, AND HONDA POSITION STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR THE PARTICULAR MODEL. THE VEHICLE WAS SPECIFICALLY PURCHASED FOR A NEWLY LICENSED DRIVER, WITH SAFETY BEING THE TOP PRIORITY. THE VEHICLE IS NO LONGER SAFE AND IT WOULD BE TRAGIC TO HAVE ANOTHER ACCIDENT, WHERE THE OTHER DRIVER IS AT FAULT, WITH A MUCH WORSE OUTCOME BECAUSE THE INTEGRITY OF THIS THIS VEHICLE IS COMPROMISED DUE TO INADEQUATE REPAIR.   UNFORTUNATELY I CANNOT LOAD ALL THE REPAIR PHOTOS, BUT THE HOOD IS NOT FITTED, THE PILLARS ARE BUCKLED, THE FOOT ROCKERS/ FLOOR PAN IS LOOSE.",
