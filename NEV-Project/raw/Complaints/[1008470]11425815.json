I noticed right away that the carjerks when I accelerate, it also stalls when trying to accelerate when making a turn which cam cause an accident.  The vehicle revs and slowly moves and then takes off. Its a dragging motion when driving its very slow. The steering wheel locks when turning as if I need power steering fluid. This car is a hazard, waiting to happen. When starting it, it makes this loud humming noise. I just had it inspected and the mechanic said the car was fine, but driving it is a different story.",
