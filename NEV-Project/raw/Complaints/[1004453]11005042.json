ON 12/20/16 I ATTEMPTED TO GET AN APPOINTMENT AT MY LOCAL BMW DEALER TO REPAIR THE FUEL PUMP, BUT WAS TOLD THAT PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE.  I ALSO TALKED WITH BMW NA, BUT GOT THE SAME ANSWER.      I CALLED DEALER AGAIN IN FEBRUARY & MARCH OF 2017, BUT WAS TOLD THAT PARTS WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL APRIL 2017.    CALLED DEALER (BMW OF ASHEVILLE) ON APRIL 18TH, STILL NO PARTS.    CALLED DEALER ON JULY 6 TO REPORT FUEL VAPORS NOTICED WHEN PARKING THE CAR.  TOLD THEY WOULD \"PURSUE THE REPAIR PARTS\".    ON JULY 7TH, I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM DAVID REIFF, SERVICE MNGR AT BMW OF A WHO STATED IN THE EMAIL: \"MR. THERIEN, I WILL SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO ESCALATE THIS CASE.  THE FUEL SMELL IS NOT PART OF THE RECALL PART.\"   ON JULY 7TH, I RESPONDED BY EMAIL: \"I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULD STATE THAT \"THE FUEL SMELL IS NOT PART OF THE RECALL PART.\"  IN A STATEMENT ISSUED BY BMW NA (ALSO ON NHTSA'S WEBSITE) I QUOTE:    \"THIS SAFETY RECALL INVOLVES THE IN-TANK FUEL PUMP. THE FUEL PUMP CONNECTOR MAY BECOME DAMAGED WHICH MAY BE NOTICED BY FUEL ODOR.\"  MY WIFE AND I ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS HAVE NOTICED THE SMELL OF FUEL WHEN PARKING THIS 528I.  PLEASE EXPEDITE THIS REPAIR FOR THE SAFETY RECALL ON THIS CAR.  THIS HAS BEEN A KNOWN PROBLEM BY BMW SINCE AT LEAST JULY OF 2015.  IT HAS FURTHER BEEN BMW'S OBLIGATION PURSUANT TO RECALL CAMPAIGN NO. 16V-746 TO REPAIR THIS DEFECT WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME.  WE ARE NOW AT 9 MONTHS AFTER THE SAFETY RECALL WAS ISSUED & 7 MONTHS FROM MY FIRST REQUEST TO COMPLETE THIS REPAIR.  THIS NOT A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME.  UNLESS THIS IS RESOLVED IN A TIMELY FASHION, I WILL FORWARD MY NOTES, EMAILS AND LETTERS TO THE NHTSA IN WASHINGTON AS A FORMAL COMPLAINT.    APPARENTLY, BMW DOES NOT INTEND TO DO THESE REPAIRS.  PLEASE HELP ME TO GET THIS SAFETY ISSUE RESOLVED WITH BMW.  THANK YOU.",
