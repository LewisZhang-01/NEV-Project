THIS CAUSE TEMPERATURE TO BECOME RED WITH WHITE SMOKE COMING OUT OF THE FRONT HOOD WHILE I WAS DRIVING WITH MY WIFE AND 3 MONTH BABY. IT LOOKS VERY DANGEROUS TO DRIVE. WE FOUND OUT HONDA HAD EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON THIS TO 10 YEARS BECAUSE OF KNOWN DEFECTS. UNFORTUNATELY, I EXPERIENCED THE DEFECT 14 MONTHS AFTER MY CIVIC'S 10 YEAR WARRANTY PERIOD. HONDA CORPORATE AND OUR LOCAL HONDA DEALERSHIPS ARE NOT WILLING TO HONOR AND FIX THIS DEFECT. THE WANT TO CHARGE $5,000 TO FIX IT. THIS SHOULD BE A RECALL AS SO MANY PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING THIS. A CAR SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED UNSAFE TO DRIVE AT 11 YEARS OLD AND REQUIRE $5,000 REPAIR, AND POSE A RISK OF ENDANGERING A FAMILY WITH A NEWBORN SAFETY.",
