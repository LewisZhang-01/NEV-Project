I was told before that this would be taken care of at my next oil change, today, 2-22-2022.  The service rep said this didn't apply to my 2020 Tucson.  I told him that my car met their recall instructions.  The dealership refused to fix the potential fire hazard.  I want to go on record that I attempted to resolve the issue and the dealer said no.  I put my car in the garage and don't want my house to burn down.",
