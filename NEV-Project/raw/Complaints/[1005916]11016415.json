AFTER RESTARTING THE MOTOR RAN VERY ROUGH, STARTING AND STALLING, AND THE CHECK ENGINE CAME ON. THIS HAPPENED ON A CITY STREET. BECAUSE OF THE LURCHING OF THE ENGINE I NEARLY DROPPED THE BIKE WHILE MOVING NARROWLY AVOIDING AN ACCIDENT.     BROUGHT THE MOTORCYCLE TO THE HARLEY DAVIDSON OF SCOTTSDALE DEALERSHIP WHO ULTIMATELY DIAGNOSED THIS AS A FAULTY ECM THAT NEEDS REPLACING. THIS PART IS ON BACK ORDER FOR A MONTH LEADING ME TO SUSPECT THAT THIS IS IN FACT A COMMON PROBLEM, IN WHICH CASE THIS SHOULD PROMPT A RECALL.",
