I TOOK IT BACK TO THE FORD DISTRIBUTOR, WHERE IT WAS PURCHASED AND CARED FOR, THE 3RD TIME AND IT WAS SUPPOSABLY ATTENDED TO AND CORRECTED BY REBOOTING THE COMPUTER SYSTEM. THE CAR SHUTTERS AND DRIVES POORLY. I PURCHASED A BRAND NEW TITANIUM, TOP DOLLAR, AND RECEIVED A LEMON THAT DRIVES TERRIBLY. ALSO, THE USB PLUGS DO NOT WORK. AND HAVE BEEN ATTENDED TO 3 TIMES, WITH NO AVAIL.   I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE SERVICE MANAGER, THE GENERAL MANAGER, AND MECHANIC THAT THE SPECIFIC MODEL IS DEFECTIVE. THAT THEY JUST CAN'T GET THE CLUTCH RIGHT. AND THAT IT IS A LEMON. IT IS MY RIGHT, AS A CONSUMER, WHO THOUGHT SHE WAS BUYING THE BEST OF AMERICA'S CARS, AND PAID FULL PRICE, TO BE REIMBURSED AND COMPENSATED.",
