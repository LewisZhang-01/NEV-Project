I WAS TOLD BY BOTH THE DEALER (MACMULKIN CHEVROLET IN NASHUA) AND GM THAT MY ISSUE IS NOT COVERED DUE TO THE FACT THAT MY CAR HAS EXCEEDED THE 80K MILES. I TOLD THEM THAT I DID NOT RECEIVE THE NOTICE UNTIL MY CAR WELL EXCEEDED THE 80K MILEAGE. THE PROBLEM IS GETTING EXTREMELY WORSE. IT'S EFFECTING THE WHOLE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM OF THE CAR. THE CAR'S INSTRUMENT PANEL IS FLASHING ALL OF THE SENSOR ALERTS INTERMITTENTLY AND MY CAR WILL NOT START UNTIL I HAVE IT TOWED TO A MECHANIC AND THEY CLEAR THE FAULTS. THIS HAS HAPPENED TWICE.",
