THE DEALER TOLD ME THAT THE CAR WAS NOT RECALLED FOR DETECTIVE ALTERNATOR. SO THEY WILL REPLACE THE ALTERNATOR AND DRAINED BATTERY AT MY EXPENSE AND ALSO CHARGE FOR THE LABOUR COST. I FIND THIS VERY STRANGE AND UNJUSTIFIED. THE CAR MAYBE WAS NOT RECALLED BUT THE FAULT NOW IS EXACTLY WHAT THE RECALL WAS FOR . SO HOW COME THEY REFUSE TO REPLACE  WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY RECALLED. THIS IS AGAINST THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF  NHTSA. PLEASE GUIDE ME.",
