CONTRARY TO PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE COMPANY'S REPORT, THERE WAS NO COLLISION.     MY 2011 BMW 335I SPORTS MODEL VEHICLE WAS DECLARED A TOTAL LOSS BY PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE ON APRIL 21 2017 AND I WAS SEVERELY INJURED WITH HIP DAMAGE WHEN MY 2011  BMW CAR OVERHEATED AND STOPPED SUDDENLY WHEN I WAS SLOWLY DRIVING MY CAR ON A CITY STREET IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA. CONTRARY TO PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE'S FALSE REPORT, THERE WAS NO COLLISION.    BMW NEVER PROVIDED ANY NOTICE RE: NHTSA RECALL NUMBER 14V176 (VANOS HOUSING BOLTS), NOR PROVIDED ANY NOTICE RE: NHTSA RECALL NUMBER 17V676 (OVERHEATING LEADING TO FIRE).     INSTEAD OF OFFERING TO REPAIR OR REPLACE MY RECALLED VEHICLE,BMW, SINCE APRIL 21, 2017 AND FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS,  BMW, BMW FINANCIAL SERVICES AND PROGRESSIVE INSURANCE HAVE BEEN ORCHESTRATING TAG TEAM FINANCIAL FRAUD, REFUSING TO REPAIR OR REPLACE MY BMW VEHICLE AND DENYING ME OF STATUTORY PERSONAL INJURY BENEFITS RESULTING FROM INJURIES SUSTAINED IN MY RECALLED 2011 BMW VEHICLE.       WITH REGARD TO THE ONLY RECALL NOTICE WHICH BMW DID PROVIDE RE: THE TAKATA AIRBAGS, RATHER THAN AGREEING TO REPAIR MY TOTAL LOSS VEHICLE, BRAMAN BMW OF WEST PALM BEACH  USED THE TAKATA RECALL AS A 'BAIT AND SWITCH' OPPORTUNITY TO SELL ME A NEW BMW VEHICLE. EVEN THOUGH  BRAMAN'S WEST PALM BEACH FLORIDA BMW MANAGER HAD FIRST HAND ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE THAT MY RECALLED BMW VEHICLE WAS A TOTAL LOSS, BRAMAN BMW REFUSED TO REPAIR OR REPLACE MY TOTAL LOSS VEHICLE; BUT CONTACTED ME MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED TIMES WITHIN SIX MONTHS TO SELL ME A NEW MODEL BMW. I HAVE FULL DOCUMENTATION OF ALL OF THE ABOVE. THANK YOU.",
