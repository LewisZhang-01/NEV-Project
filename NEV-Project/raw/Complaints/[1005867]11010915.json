I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER THAT NIGHT, GOT IT BACK THE FOLLOWING MONDAY AND WAS TOLD THAT THE PROBLEM COULDN'T BE DUPLICATED. I'M GUESSING THIS IS THE STANDARD ANSWER TO THESE PROBLEMS. IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME I THAT I KNOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN A PREVIOUS ISSUE WITH THIS VEHICLE. I AM ALSO FRIGHTENINGLY AWARE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN DEATHS CAUSED BY THIS. I AM STILL DRIVING THE VEHICLE TRUSTING THAT GM STAND BEHIND THEIR VEHICLES AS WELL AS THEY TECHNICIANS. PLEASE, PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM!! I AM AWARE OF THE PREVIOUS RECALLS ON EARLIER TRAVERSES AND I WANT IT TO BE KNOWN THAT THIS ISSUE IS IN FACT STILL AN ISSUE. A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE!!!",
