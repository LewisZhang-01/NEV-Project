THE FUEL PUMP AND FUEL LINES ON TOP OF THE TANK RUST OUT AND CAUSES GAS AND FUMES TO ESCAPE THE TANK.  FUEL WILL SPRAY ONTO EXHAUST AND UNDER THE VEHICLE CAUSING A FIRE HAZARD.  ALSO EXCESSIVE FUEL VAPORS ESCAPE THE TANK. I HAVE RESEARCHED THE PROBLEM ONLINE AND THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS TO GM OF THE PROBLEM BUT GM HAS NOT ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM.  I AM NOT LOOKING FOR ANY MONETARY GAIN I SIMPLY WANT GM TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED. SOME PEOPLE REPORTED THE PROBLEM BEFORE 100,000 MILES AND NEARLY ALL PROBLEMS OCCUR BEFORE 150,000.",
