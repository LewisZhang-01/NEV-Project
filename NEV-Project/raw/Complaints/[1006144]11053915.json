I HAD A LOSS OF STEERING AND BRAKING.I ALMOST HIT THE CAR NEXT TO ME.  LUCKILY THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.  I KEPT PRESSING DOWN ON THE BRAKE, BUT IT TOOK TIME FOR THE STEEERING WHEEL TO RESPOND TO ME.  I SHUT OFF THE CAR BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE THE CAR HAD A MIND OF ITS OWN. I HAD 2 WITNESSES IN THE CAR.WHO SAW THAT MY CAR WAS IN DRIVE, AND THAT MY FOOT WAS ON THE BRAKE PEDAL.  THE PASSENGER CHECKED THE FLOOR MAT, AND IT WAS LYING COMPLETELY FLAT.  I DO NOT KNOW WHY I HAD THIS LOSS OF CONTROL.  THIS ALSO HAPPENED TO ME IN 2010, WHEN I HAD UNINTENDED ACCELERATION,AND MY CAR HIT A TREE.  I AM NOW AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR, AND WILLL NOT DO SO BECAUSE I FEEL IT IS UNSAFE.",
