        "summary": "I HAVE A JEEP CHEROKEE SPORT 2015, 14K MILES; ON 3 DIFFERENT OCCASIONS THE TRANSMISSION HAS DISENGAGE WHILE DRIVING ON HIGHWAY LOSING ALL ACCELERATION AND RESPONSE.  CHECK ENGINE LIGHT 'ON' AND \"SERVICE TRANSMISSION\" ALERT DISPLAYED.  AFTER TURNING THE CAR OFF AND RESTARTING, CHECK ENGINE LIGHT STAYED ON BUT NO \"SERVICE TRANSMISSION\" ALERT.  I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE THE CAR FOR 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE SAME EVENTS HAPPENED AGAIN.  ALL EVENTS OCCURRED WHILE HIGHWAY DRIVING AND AFTER A OIL CHANGE (SECOND).  I HAD DRIVEN (UNDER 40 MPH) THE CAR IN TOWN FOR 2 WEEKS AFTER OIL CHANGE WITH NO ISSUES.  NO PREVIOUS ISSUES BEFORE OIL CHANGE.  THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS ISSUE; MANY COMPLAINTS CAN BE FOUND ON LINE OF THIS VERY ISSUE, SUGGESTING A SOFTWARE OR SENSOR ISSUE.  WILL SOMEONE HAVE TO PAY THE ULTIMATE PRICE WITH THEIR LIFE BEFORE A TOTAL RECALL IS ISSUED? COMPLAINT FILED WITH WASHINGTON STATE AG OFFICE AND US CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES",
