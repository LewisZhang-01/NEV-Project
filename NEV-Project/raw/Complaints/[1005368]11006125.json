ONE EVENING AFTER STARTING THE CAR YOU COULD SMELL SMOKE AND THE INFORMATION LIGHT CAME ON INDICATING A PROBLEM WITH THE CHARGING SYSTEM. I RESEARCHED THE SYMPTOMS AND FOUND AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE 3.6 L DODGE ALTERNATORS SO I CALLED DODGE. THEY BRUSHED IT OFF SO PURCHASED A NEW ALTERNATOR THE NEXT DAY AND INSTALLED IT. SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD NO ISSUES WITH THE CAR STALLING AND LOOSING STEERING.",
