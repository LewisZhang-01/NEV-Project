THERE IS A HIDDEN FEATURE IN FORD FUSION WHERE WE CAN SET A DELAY FOR THE LIGHTS TO TURN ON. I ENTERED A TUNNEL WHICH IS COMPLETELY DARK AND NO LIGHTS WERE THERE INSIDE THE TUNNEL. I COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING AS THE LIGHTS DIDN'T TURNED ON. I FORTUNATELY MET  WITH A SMALL INCIDENT BUT THIS HIDDEN FEATURE DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. I DROVE OTHER VEHICLES WHERE IN AUTOMATIC LIGHTS SWITCH ON IMMEDIATELY. I AM UNAWARE OF THIS SETTING AS I DON'T OWN THIS CAR. PLEASE ENSURE  MANUFACTURER DISABLES THIS SETTING AND THEY ENSURE SAFETY OF FORD USERS. THE RENTAL COMPANY DECLINED TO ACCEPT IT AS THEIR FAULT BUT I  WANT SOMEONE LIKE NHTSA CONTACT RENTAL CAR COMPANIES TO DISABLE THESE SETTINGS AND ALSO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER AND UNDERSTAND THE BENEFIT OF THIS SETTING. AS PER ME IT IS A RISKY SETTING WITHOUT MUCH POSITIVE BENEFITS. I WANT TO ENSURE SAFETY OF OTHER FORD USERS.",
