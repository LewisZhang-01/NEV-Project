CALLED DEALER AND WAS INFORMED THAT MY WARRANTY EXPIRED IN JANUARY OF 2017.     IN RESEARCHING THE REPAIR I DISCOVERED THAT EQUINOX 2013 AND I THINK OTHER YEARS HAD A RECALL FOR THE EXACT FAILURE ON MY VEHICLE.  THE REPAIR MECHANIC CALL GM VERIFIED THE RECALL ON 2013'S, THE FAILURE ON MY VEHICLE 2014 AND GM UNWILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR THIS VEHICLE REPAIR.    THE UNBELIEVABLE IRONY OF THIS SAFETY ISSUE IS THAT WHEN THE REPAIR PART ARRIVED IT CLEARLY STATED \"RECALL\" ON THE LABEL. IT WAS LIKE GIVING ME THE MIDDLE FINGER ALONG WITH THE BILL.    GM SHOULD ADD 2014 AND ANY OTHER VEHICLES USING THIS COMPONENT TO THEIR WIPER RECALL DUE TO SAFETY CONCERNS BEFORE SOMEONE GETS SERIOUSLY INJURED.",
