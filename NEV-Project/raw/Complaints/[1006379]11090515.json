TOYOTA SENT A NOTICE OF A WARRANTY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM IN 2017 ON THIS ISSUE, DESCRIBING THE PROPOSED REPAIR AS THE INSTALLATION OF \"VOLTAGE ADJUSTMENT WIRE HARNESSES.\" AS INSTRUCTED, I TOOK MY 2010 PRIUS TO A DEALERSHIP ON JANUARY 19, 2018 AND WAS TOLD THAT IT REQUIRED A REPAIR, BUT THE PARTS WERE NOT IN STOCK AND WERE ON BACK ORDER. IN A FOLLOW UP CALL TO THE DEALERSHIP ON APRIL 26, 2016, THE REPRESENTATIVE SAID THE PARTS WERE STILL ON BACK ORDER, AND THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF WHEN THEY MIGHT BE RECEIVED. THE ADMITTEDLY DEFECTIVE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IN MY CAR CAN AND HAS CAUSED MY HEADLIGHTS TO BURN OUT PREMATURELY, WHICH IS AN OBVIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM. EVEN THOUGH TOYOTA RECOGNIZES THE PROBLEM, THEY SEEM TO BE DRAGGING THEIR FEET IN CORRECTING IT.",
