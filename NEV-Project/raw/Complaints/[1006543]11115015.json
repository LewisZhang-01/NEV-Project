NISSAN IS NOW INFORMING US THAT THE ENTIRE AIRBAG SYSTEM IS DEFECTIVE, YET THEY MAINTAIN THAT THIS ISSUE IS UNRELATED TO THE PRIOR RECALLS AND AS SUCH, HAVE REFUSED TO COVER THE COST OF REPAIR. IN ADDITION, THE VISORS ON BOTH THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDES HAVE BROKEN AND ARE SAGGING, IMPAIRING VISION DURING VEHICLE OPERATION. IN RESEARCHING SOLUTIONS, WE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT BOTH ISSUES ARE COMMON COMPLAINTS FOR DRIVERS OF OUR SPECIFIC MODEL PATHFINDER, YET NISSAN SEEMS TO BE DOING NOTHING TO FIX THESE RECURRENT DEFECTS.",
