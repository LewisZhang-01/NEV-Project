BY THE TIME I GOT HOME IT WAS MUCH WORST! I CHECK THE OIL AGAIN, THERE WAS STILL OIL AT THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL. THIS TIME THE DIP STICK HAD METAL SHAVINGS ON IT. I CALLED MY LOCAL GARAGE AND HAD IT TOWED TO THEM. THEY SAID IT NEEDED A NEW ENGINE! I HAD IT BROUGHT TO THE DEALER THAT I BOUGHT IT FROM KEMPER KIA OF BRIDGEWATER NJ. THEY ALSO AGREED THE ENGINE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. THEY TOLD ME A RECALL FOR THIS ENGINE JUST CAME OUT. THE RECALL IS FOR PREMATURE BEARING WEAR CAUSING THESE ENGINES TO THROW A ROD.
