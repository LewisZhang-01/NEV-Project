WHEN I TRY UNLOCKING MY VEHICLE USING THE KEYPAD OR THE ELECTRIC LOCKS WITHIN THE VEHICLE, IT SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK ON MY TWO FRONT DOORS DESPITE HAVING ELECTRIC LOCKS IN MY VEHICLE.  MY RESEARCH OF OTHER CUSTOMERS' ISSUES ONLINE REVEAL SIMILAR ISSUES TO MINE.  (SEE HTTPS://WWW.QUORA.COM/THE-ELECTRONIC-LOCK-UNLOCK-ON-THE-PASSENGER-DOOR-OF-MY-TOYOTA-COROLLA-HAS-CEASED-TO-OPERATE-AND-I-HAVE-TO-OPERATE-IT-MANUALLY-HOW-DO-I-FIX-IT-MYSELF; HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=UXH0ITV4_NC; HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=SJEFB1QUTVI; HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=CVB63KY1LM8.)    I AM CONCERNED ABOUT MY SAFETY BECAUSE IF I GET IN AN ACCIDENT AND CANNOT UNLOCK THE DOORS BECAUSE OF THE FAULTY DOOR LOCKS, I COULD BE SERIOUSLY INJURED AND DIE.  THIS SAME CONCERN EXTENDS TO MY PASSENGERS.  THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN THAT NEEDS ADDRESSED, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE RECURRING AND CONSISTENT INSTANCES OF THIS ISSUE IN TOYOTA VEHICLES.    I LOOK FORWARD TO COMMENTS REGARDING THE OVERALL SAFETY CONCERNS RELATING TO TOYOTA VEHICLES AND THEIR DOOR LOCK ISSUES.    THANK YOU.",
