I WAS NOT IN ANY KIND OF ACCIDENT WHATSOEVER NOR WAS THERE A REASON FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. MEDFORD NISSAN TOLD ME THEY WOULD NOT REPAIR IT THAT I HAD TO PAY 120.00 JUST FOR THEM TO DETECT WHAT WAS WRONG. THEN THEY WANTED ME TO PAY TO FIX IT. I DID NOTHING THAT WOULD CAUSE THIS TO HAPPEN. SCROLLING THROUGH AIRBAG COMPLAINTS FROM THE 2014 NISSAN PATHFINDERS IT LOOKS LIKE THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE.",
