AFTER NOT DRIVING FOR THREE DAYS I FOUND OUT THAT CAUSE OF THE PAIN  COMING FROM MY 2018 EQUINOX DRIVERS SEAT. I PUT A PILLOW IN THE DRIVER SEAT AND THE PAIN WENT AWAY. IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE WITH THE PILLOW BECAUSE IT IS ALWAYS SLIDING AND MY FOOT KEEPS SLIDING OFF THE PEDALS.  GM NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THEY ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WITH THE SEATS. GM SHOULD HAVE REPLACEMENT SEAT FOR THESE VEHICLES INSTEAD OF  DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT. PLEASE HELP.
