        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING FROM TULSA TO JOPLIN WHEN THE BATTERY SAVER LIGHT CAME ON. SHORTLY AFTER I LOST ALL DIGITAL GAUGES AND POWER STEERING. CAR SHUT OFF AND BECAME HARD TO CONTROL. I WAS IN LEFT LANE ON INTERSTATE WITH TRACTOR TRAILERS IN THE RIGHT LANE, CAR SLOWED TO AROUND 10 MILES AN HOUR AS I TRIED TO GET ACROSS RIGHT LANE ONTO SHOULDER. CAR IN RIGHT LANE WOULD NOT MOVE AND ALMOST CAUSED ACCIDENT. WAS ABLE TO GET CAR TO SHOULDER. ORIGINAL ALTERNATOR FAILED AT 130,000 MILES. DODGE WANTED OVER 600 DOLLARS TO REPLACE AND SAID THE ORIGINAL RECALL DID NOT EFFECT MY MODEL. PURCHASED A SECOND ALTERNATOR FROM AUTOZONE BUT IT WAS DEAD OUT OF THE BOX. THIRD ALTERNATOR LASTED FROM SEPTEMBER 2016 TO JULY 2017. INSTALLED FOURTH ALTERNATOR ON 7/15/2017 BUT DIAGNOSTICS SHOWS THE REGULATOR IS FAILING. AUTOZONE IS TELLING ME THAT DODGE HAS OTHER ISSUES CAUSING FAILURE. PROBLEM I HAVE IS DODGE WOULD NOT REPLACE THE ORIGINAL ALTERNATOR AS IT WAS NOT INCLUDED IN RECALL.",
