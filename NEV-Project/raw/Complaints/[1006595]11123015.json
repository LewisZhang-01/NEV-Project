        "summary": "THE REAR LIFT GATE LATCH ON OUR VEHICLE IS UNSAFE.  THERE IS NO METHOD OF UNLOCKING / UNLATCHING THE LIFT GATE IF THE DRIVER IS INSIDE THE VEHICLE.  OUR OWNER'S MANUAL CHAPTER ON MANUALLY OPERATED LIFT GATE OPERATION, PAGE 68, STATES THAT THE VEHICLE SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH TWO METHODS OF UNLATCHING.  THE FIRST, A BUTTON 'LOCATED IN THE TOP OF THE LIFT GATE PULL CUP HANDLE ' AND THE SECOND A BUTTON ON THE REMOTE CONTROL KEY FOB THAT WILL UNLATCH THE GATE BY 'PRESSING THE (2X) BUTTON TWICE WITHIN THREE SECONDS '.  OUR VEHICLE WAS DELIVERED NEW WITH A KEY FOB THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE 2X BUTTON.  THE RESULT IS THAT THE LIFT GATE CAN ONLY BE UNLATCHED FROM OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE.  IN AN EMERGENCY OR IF SOMEONE WERE TRAPPED IN THE VEHICLE, THERE IS NO LIFT GATE RELEASE BUTTON INSIDE THE CAR OR ON THE REMOTE AS STATED IN THE MANUAL.",
