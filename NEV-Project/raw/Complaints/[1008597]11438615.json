        "summary": "The subject vehicle was take to dealer to address recall SC176.  In this recall there is a flow chart instructing the dealer on how to repair the subject vehicle. This flow chart was clearly not followed. The dealer only performed the ECU Logic improvement and did not replace the catalytic converter.  The subject vehicle had trouble code P0420 before it arrived.  The code was cleared while in the dealers care but returned 6 miles after the vehicle was picked up.  Service manager Nick was contacted, He said there were no stored codes however I provided documentation show the code was there and the check engine light was on when dropped off at the dealership.  I believe this is a violation of NHTSA.  Because the subject vehicle still has a defective Catalytic converter that is manufacture defect.",
