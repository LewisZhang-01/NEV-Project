        "summary": "TRAILER BRAKE CONTROLLER  THE FACTORY TRAILER BRAKE CONTROLLER IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY WHEN A TRAILER WITH ELECTRIC SERVICE BRAKES IS PROPERLY CONNECTED TO THE TRUCK.  THE CONTROLLER HAS ABOUT A 30 SECOND DELAY AND DOES NOT PUSH ENOUGH ELECTRICITY TO THE TRAILER BRAKES TO ENGAGE THEM FULLY.  THIS RESULTS IN LONGER STOPPING DISTANCE FOR THE TRUCK AND TRAILER COMBINATION, POSSIBLE BRAKE FAILURE FOR THE TRUCK DUE TO OVERLOADING OF THE BRAKES WHICH, COULD RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT.  I HAVE HAD MY TRAILER BRAKES CHECKED BY A PROFESSIONAL.  THEY ARE PERFORMING AS THEY ARE DESIGNED TO.  I HAVE CONTACTED MY FORD DEALER AND HE ASSURES ME THAT MY FACTORY CONTROLLER IS WORKING AS IT SHOULD.  I DO NOT BELIEVE THEM.  I STILL HAVE A TRAILER THAT IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH ELECTRICITY TO APPLY THE BRAKES.",
