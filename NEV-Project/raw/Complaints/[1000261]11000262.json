I GOT THE DPS ERROR AND TOOK IT TO THE CAN-AM DEALER THEY SAID IT IS GOING TO COST ME 2500 TO GET IT FIX (AND THAT THIS ERROR ISN'T ONE THAT COULD BE PUT OFF). I ASKED IF IT IS COVERED BY WARRANTY OR A RECALL SYSTEM THEY SAID NO THAT MY VIN # DIDN'T FALL IN THAT CATEGORY. I LOOKED IT UP ON THE CAN-AM WEBSITE AND ALL THE WEBSITE SAYS IS THE MAKE AND MODEL AND YEAR OF THE RECALL NOT THAT IT IS LIMITED TO A VIN # RANGE.",
