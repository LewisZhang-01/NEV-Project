ALL WE KNEW WAS THAT THERE WAS NO CONTROL OF THE CAR AS IT WAS BEING DRIVEN. AS WE WERE LEAVING TOWN THE NEXT DAY, WE DROPPED IT AT OUR REGULAR REPLACE PLACE.  WHILE WE WERE OUT OF TOWN, THEY REPAIRED THE CAR.    WHILE WE WERE OUT OF TOWN, WE WERE IN CONTACT WITH THE REPAIR PEOPLE.  THEY ORDERED AND REPLACED THE PART.  IN FURTHER DISCUSSION, THEY WERE SURPRISED THAT AN 8 YEAR OLD CAR, THAT HAS BEEN MAINTAINED REGULARLY AND ONLY HAS 85000 MILES ON, HAD SUCH A SUBSTANTIVE FAILURE.     THE SUBFRAME CRACKED WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY, WHILE DRIVING.",
