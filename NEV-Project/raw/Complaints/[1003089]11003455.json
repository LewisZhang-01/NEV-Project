        "summary": "RECENTLY, WE HAVE NOTICED THE SUNROOF OF OUR OUTLOOK STARTED LEAKING INTO THE FRAME OF THE CAR.  WE DON'T USE IT MUCH, SO IT WAS AN ANNOYANCE, IT WOULD DRIP WATER ON THE DRIVER'S LAP AFTER A RAIN.    THEN RAINWATER STARTED LEAKING OUT OF AIRBAGS IN THE FRONT DASH AND WINDSHIELD SUPPORT AREA.    STARTING TWO DAYS AGO, AFTER A RAINSTORM, THE CAR WILL REMAIN RUNNING WHEN THE KEY IS REMOVED, AND SOMETIMES THE KEY CANNOT BE REMOVED, WHETHER THE CAR IS RUNNING OR NOT. THE BATTERY ALSO DIES EVERY NIGHT, DESPITE BEING A NEW BATTERY AND REMAINING ON A CHARGER.   ONLINE FORUMS STATE THE ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH WATER ACCESSING THE CIRCUIT BOARD AND FUSE AREA, ALLOWING ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS TO REMAIN OPERATING THROUGH A CROSS-FIRE OR CARBON-TRACKING, USING THE MOISTURE TO COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT.  THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD FOR MANY REASONS, NOT ONLY A POTENTIAL FIRE RISK, OR RISK OF THE VEHICLE MOVING AFTER IT'S BEEN SHUT OFF, BUT ALSO POSSIBLE DEGRADATION OF AIRBAG SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE DASH AND WINDSHIELD AREA.",
