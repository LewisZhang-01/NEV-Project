        "summary": "I PURCHASED A NEW GRAND DESIGN MOMENTUM 350M AT HOLIDAY WORLD KATY, TEXAS. AFTER TAKING DELIVERY OF THE CAMPING TRAILER & CHECKING HOOK-UP TO TRUCK, LIGHTS & BRAKES IN THE PARKING LOT, I TOWED THE 350M ABOUT 50 MILES ACROSS HOUSTON. I WAS QUITE CONCERNED WITH THE POOR BRAKING QUALITY OF THE CAMPING TRAILER, EVEN AFTER INCREASING THE TRUCK BRAKE CONTROLLER GAIN TO 9.5 (OF POSSIBLE 10).  I THOUGHT MAYBE THE BRAKES NEEDED MORE 'BREAK-IN TIME' SO A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER I SLOWLY TOWED THE CAMPING TRAILER 400 MILES TO MY HOME IN S. TEXAS.  I BECAME VERY CONCERNED WITH THE BRAKING QUALITY OF THE 350M AND CONSIDERED IT A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  ONCE HOME, I WOULD NOT TOW THE UNIT ANY FURTHER WITHOUT MAKING SERIOUS IMPROVEMENT TO THE TRAILERS BRAKING CAPABILITY.  AFTER JOINING GRAND DESIGN OWNER FORUMS WE REALIZED THAT MANY OTHER OWNERS ALSO HAD BRAKING ISSUES. I HAD A CERTIFIED MECHANIC PULL WHEELS & HUBS.  LIKE MANY OTHER OWNERS, ALL 4 ELECTRIC/MAGNETIC BRAKES  (DRUMS, MAGNETS, SHOES & ALL INSIDE THE DRUMS) WERE COATED WITH A HEAVY FILM OF GREASE. UNDERSTANDABLE WHY THE 350M & LIPPERT'S SELF ADJUSTING, ELECTRIC, MAGNETIC BRAKE SYSTEM WAS EXHIBITING VERY POOR QUALITY, UNSAFE BRAKING CAPABILITY. LIPPERT (LCI) SEMI-ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE IN JANUARY 2017 BUT WOULD NOT ADMIT ANY FAULT ON THEIR BEHALF. THERE IS OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM WITH THEIR BRAKE SYSTEM THAT NEEDS ATTENTION FROM THE NHTSA BEFORE THERE IS A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.  ATTACHED IS A PICTURE SHOWING SOME OF THE GREASE CONTAMINATION UPON REMOVING THE WHEEL HUB FROM THE AXLE. THESE BRAKES DEPEND ON THE MAGNETIC FORCE AGAINST THE ROTATING HUB TO 'APPLY BRAKE SHOE PRESSURE TO THE DRUM'.  UNDERSTANDABLE WHY THE BRAKES DO NOT WORK EFFECTIVELY WITH A GREASE FILM ON THE MAGNET, ALL INSIDE THE DRUM AREA & ALSO ON BRAKE SHOES.  SHAMEFUL WHY A LARGE COMPANY LIKE LIPPERT WILL NOT \"OWN UP\" TO & CORRECT THE PROBLEM !  CAN THE NHTSA HELP ?",
