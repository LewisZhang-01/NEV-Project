        "summary": "HEADLAMPS (LOW BEAM ONLY) ARE TOO DIM WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT. IN AREAS WHERE THE ROADS ARE NOT WELL LIT DRIVING WITH LOW BEAMS ON IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. WE HAVE AVOIDED DRIVING AT NIGHT OR WITH HIGH BEAMS ON (WHICH BECOMES DANGEROUS FOR OTHER DRIVERS). WE REPORTED THE PROBLEM DIRECTLY TO CADILLAC VIA A PHONE CALL AND WAS TOLD TO SEE A DEALERSHIP. THE DEALERSHIP (MASSEY CADILLAC OF NORTH ORLANDO) INFORMED US THIS WAS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE HEADLAMPS PROJECTOR BUT THERE IS NO RECALL ON IT. THE HEADLAMPS CANNOT BE FIXED, ONLY REPLACED. REPLACING THE HEADLAMPS WOULD COST JUST OVER $1,000.00. WE FEEL CADILLAC HAS A DEFECT IN THERE HEADLAMPS AND IS MAKING NO EFFORT TO RECTIFY THE ISSUE. WE CAN ONLY SPECULATE AS TO WHY CADILLAC WILL NOT RECALL OR HELP CUSTOMERS WITH OUT-OF-DATE WARRANTIES.    THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE LOW BEAM GETTING TO HOT AND CREATING DISTORTION OR A BUILD-UP IN THE PROJECTOR.  WE CAN TAKE PHOTOS IF NEEDED, BUT FELT IT MIGHT BE HARD TO TELL WHAT'S GOING ON VIA A PHOTO.",
