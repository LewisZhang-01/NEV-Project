I MUST THEN PUT THE CAR BACK IN PARK AND RESTART THE ENGINE BEFORE PULLING OUT AGAIN.  THIS CREATES DANGEROUS SITUATION AS THE CAR BEHIND ME IS EXPECTING ME TO PULL OUT AGAIN WITHOUT THIS ADDED DELAY.  I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS IS GOING TO RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT AND I WILL BE REAR ENDED BY THE CAR BEHIND ME.  I HAVE TAKEN THE CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP, BUT THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO RECREATE THE PROBLEM IN THE SHOP THE ONE DAY THEY TRIED.  I ALSO CONTACTED SUBARU CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND THEY SAID THE DEALER NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO RECREATE IT TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  FROM WHAT I READ W/R/T OTHER'S EXPERIENCES, THIS SOUNDS LIKE THE TORQUE CONVERTER PROBLEM THAT SUBARU JUST RECENTLY EXTENDED THE WARRANTY ON, YET THEY ARE STILL NOT GOING TO FIX THE PROBLEM.  I WOULD HOPE THAT THIS COULD BE ELEVATED TO A RECALL BEFORE MORE ACCIDENTS OCCUR.",
