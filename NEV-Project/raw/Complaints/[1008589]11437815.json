If you pull over and turn the vehicle off for a little bit upon turning it on again power steering will be restored and the warning will be gone. The problem is intermittent and does not provide any system codes when a code reader inserted. The issue is prominent and is a known recall for the 2015 models built in early 2015. Many owners of 2016 models have reported the same issue and the dealer has said the fix is replacing the steering rack but since there is no recall it is not covered.",
