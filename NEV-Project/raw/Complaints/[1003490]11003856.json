I COULD DO NOTHING BUT TAKE MY FOOT OFF THE GAS TO SLOW THE TRUCK DOWN.  IT LITERALLY HOPPED DOWN THE ROAD , IT FELT LIKE WE WERE IN A PAINT MIXER BOUNCING DOWN THE ROAD. THIS HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE BUT WAS NEVER AS BAD AS THIS TIME.  MY WIFE WAS WITH ME THIS TIME AND COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT IT WAS DOING.  SHE TOLD ME IF SHE HAD BEEN DRIVING SHE WOULD HAVE PANICKED AND MOST LIKELY WRECKED THE TRUCK.   EVERYTHING IN THE TRUCK WAS BEING TOSSED AROUND.  THIS ISSUE MUST BE CORRECTED BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT OR WORSE.",
