IT SET OFF THE AIRBAG DASH LIGHT, BUT THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY.   THE DEALERSHIP DIAGNOSED A PROBLEM WITH THE STEERING WHEEL CANISTER OR COIL FOR THE AIRBAG, AND A REAR SENSOR IN THE BUMPER OF THE VEHICLE.  I AM WONDERING IF THIS IS RELATED TO THE TAKATA AIR BAG RECALL.  IT HAS NOT HAD A CAR ACCIDENT SINCE WE HAVE OWNED IT IN 2017.  I AM UNSURE WHEN THIS HAPPENED. IT WAS IN THE LAST YEAR.",
