PROCEED TO DRIVE HOME TO CONTACT FORD, BOTH LIGHTS COME ON AGAIN, CAR BEGINS DECLERATING WITH NO WARNING, NO ACTION ON ACCELERATOR, CAR SLOWS (I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS CALLED LIMPING) AND I PULLED OF HIGHWAY AND GET TO PARKING LOT.   CAR TOWED TO  FORD DEALER.  I HAD NO CLUE WHAT PROBLEM WAS  REPLACED ELECTRONIC THROTTLE BODY  CAR IS 7 YEARS OLD, ONLY 43,700 MILES.  AFRAID TO DRIVE CAR AS THIS CAN HAPPEN AGAIN - WHAT IF I'M IN HEAVY TRAFFIC AT HIGH SPEEDS.  CAN'T BELIEVE FORD WAS ABLE TO AVOID A RECALL --- THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PROBLEM!!!!",
