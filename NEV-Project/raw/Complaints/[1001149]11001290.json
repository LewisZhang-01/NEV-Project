        "summary": "TAKATA RECALL.  I CALLED CARL BLACK CHEVROLET, IN EAST ORLANDO, ON JULY 17, 2017, TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE MY PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG REPLACED IN RESPONSE TO A RECALL.  THEY ACKNOWLEDGED THE ISSUE AND I MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR 10:00 ON JULY 24.  I ASKED THEM IF THEY NEEDED THE VIN.  THE RESPONSE WAS NO, THEY WOULD CHECK THE VIN WHEN I CAME IN.  I ASKED IF THE AIRBAGS WERE AVAILABLE.  THE RESPONSE WAS YES, THAT THEY WERE AVAILABLE.  DURING THE WEEK, I STOPPED BY THE DEALERSHIP TO VERIFY THAT THE PARTS WERE AVAILABLE AND TO DETERMINE HOW LONG THE REPAIR WOULD BE.  THE PERSON I SPOKE TO SCANNED THE VEHICLE IN, VERIFIED THE EXISTENCE OF PARTS, BUT WARNED ME THAT THIS RECALL WOULD TAKE SEVERAL HOURS.  WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR IN ON JUNE 24, THE FELLOW IMMEDIATELY TOLD ME THAT THE PART WAS NOT AVAILABLE LOCALLY AND HE WOULD HAVE TO \"SPECIAL ORDER\" IT AND THAT THE ORDER WOULD TAKE AT LEAST A WEEK.  I TOLD HIM OF MY PREVIOUS CONTACTS WITH THE DEALERSHIP AND ASKED HIM TO VERIFY.  HE DISAPPEARED   FOR A FEW MINUTES, CAME BACK, AND SAID THE PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE.  I ASKED WHY THE OTHER PEOPLE HAD TOLD ME THAT THE PARTS WERE AVAILABLE.  HE SAID THAT HE COULD NOT SPEAK FOR THEM, BUT THE PARTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE AND WOULD NEED TO BE \"SPECIAL ORDERED\", WHICH WOULD TAKE \"AT LEAST A WEEK AND POSSIBLY CONSIDERABLY MORE\".  I ASKED IF SOMEONE WOULD CALL ME WHEN THE PARTS CAME IN AND THEY SAID MAYBE, BUT I SHOULD CALL THEM.    IT SEEMED PRETTY CLEAR THAT THESE PEOPLE DID NOT WANT TO REPAIR MY CAR. THEY SAID THAT THEY WERE JUST ENFORCING GM'S POLICY.  IF SO, IT APPEARS THAT GM IS NOT ACTING IN GOOD FAITH WITH THIS RECALL.",
