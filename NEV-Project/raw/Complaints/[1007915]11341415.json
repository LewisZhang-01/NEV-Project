        "summary": "I HAVE BEEN HAVING SOME ISSUES WITH MY RECENT PURCHASE THAT I AM HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME RESOLVING.  I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN SOME WEEKS AGO BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOUD NOISE COMING FROM THE STEERING COLUMN. THE ISSUE WAS DISMISSED AS A NORMAL \"BREAKING IN\" AND SHOULD GO AWAY AS I APPROACH 12,000 MILES. THIS WAS VERY TROUBLING AS I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A NEW VEHICLE WITH THIS ISSUE. ON JULY 9, 2020, I RETURNED THE CAR WITH THE SAME STEERING ISSUE AND TO HAVE THE OIL CHANGED.  AFTER NOT HEARING ANYTHING BACK FROM THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT, I WENT BACK TO LOYALTY TO CHECK THE STATUS. AT THIS TIME, I WAS TOLD THAT THE ISSUE WAS A FAULTY RACK AND PINION BUT THE SERVICE ADVISOR WAS UNSURE ON A TIMELINE AND WOULD NOT KNOW ANYTHING UNTIL MONDAY.  AFTER NOT HEARING BACK FROM THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT, I RETURNED TO LOYALTY MONDAY EVENING TO LEARN THAT THE PART IS ON BACKORDER AND IT WILL BE SOME MONTHS BEFORE IT IS AVAILABLE.  I AM ALSO TOLD AT THIS TIME BY TWO OF YOUR SERVICES ADVISORS THAT THE VEHICLE IS SAFE TO DRIVE WITH A FAULTY RACK AND PINION, BUT AT THE SAME TIME WAS TOLD BY ONE OF YOUR SERVICE TECHNICIANS THAT HE ABSOLUTELY ADVISES AGAINST DRIVING IT WITH A FAULTY RACK AND PINION UNTIL IT IS REPAIRED. ALSO, THE SAME SERVICE ADVISOR THAT TOLD ME THE ISSUE WAS A NORMAL \"BREAKING IN\" ON SATURDAY EXPLAINS, REPEATEDLY, THAT HE HAS AN ATLAS THAT HAS BEEN THERE FOR SEVERAL MONTHS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM WAITING ON THE SAME PART.  I WAS ALSO TOLD BY A LOYALTY SALES ASSOCIATE ON THURSDAY (7/23) THAT A LOYALTY EMPLOYEE HAS A SIMILAR VEHICLE WITH THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM. THIS MAKES THE FACT THAT I WAS DISMISSED A FEW WEEKS AGO EVEN MORE TROUBLING, ESPECIALLY SINCE THE MILITARY IS MOVING US NEARLY 900 MILES IN A FEW DAYS.",
