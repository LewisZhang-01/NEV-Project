        "summary": "THE ACADIA HAD A RECALL ON THE SUNROOF FOR LEAKING LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER INTO THE INTERIOR OF THE VEHICLE DURING INCLEMENT WEATHER.  MY ACADIA HAD THIS PROBLEM AND WATER LEAKED INTO THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE DOWN THE FRAME ADJACENT TO THE DOOR AND WINDOW THROUGH THE PASSENGER SIDE DASH INTO THE FLOOR AREA.    THERE IS A FUSE BOX LOCATED IN THIS AREA AS WELL AS A VERY LARGE ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR THAT CONNECTS TWO PORTIONS OF THE WIRING HARNESS.  THE EXPOSURE OF THIS COMPONENT TO WATER HAS RESULTED IN CORROSION OCCURRING WITH THIS CONNECTOR.  THIS IS A MAJOR CONNECTOR AFFECTING MULTIPLE SYSTEMS OF THE VEHICLE.    THE SYSTEM GIVING ME THE LARGEST CAUSE FOR CONCERN IS THE DOOR LOCKS. ON A DAILY BASIS THE LOCKS WON'T RESPOND TO THE LOCK/UNLOCK BUTTON ON ANY OF THE DOORS NOT WILL I RESPOND TO THE LOCK/UNLOCK BUTTON ON THE KEY REMOTE.    THIS POSES A SIGNIFICANT EGRESS DANGER AS THE ONLY WAY TO UNLOCK ANY OF THE DOORS IS TO MANUALLY PUT UP THE LOCK.  THIS IS FOR EVERY DOOR, ALL FOUR OF THEM.    I HAVE AN INFANT IN THE BACK SEAT OF THE VEHICLE AND IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION IT WOULD REQUIRE ME TO LITERALLY CRAWL FROM THE FRONT DRIVER SEAT TO THE REAR SEAT, MANUALLY UNLOCK THE DOOR AND THEN ATTEMPT TO EXIT THE VEHICLE.    THIS ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR AS THE FAULT DUE TO CORROSION FROM WATER HAS BEEN OCCURRING NOT JUST TO ME, IT HAS BEEN OCCURRING TO MANY OWNERS THAT SUFFERED FROM LEAKING ROOFS ON THEIR BRAND NEW VEHICLES.    I FEEL THAT GMC NEEDS TO STEP UP AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE SAFETY HAZARD THEY CREATED AND SHOULD BE HELD RESPONSIBLE.  BY THE NHTSA IF THEY WILL NOT DO IT THEMSELVES.",
