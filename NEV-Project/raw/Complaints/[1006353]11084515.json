THEY FOUND A RECALL FOR THIS MODEL F150 BUT IT DID NOT INCLUDE THE DATE OF BUILD ON MY VEHICLE.  RECALL 16S19.  IT IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY NOTICE AS TO WHEN IT MIGHT ACT UP AND YOU LOOSE POWER WITHOUT ANY WARNING. IT HAPPENS WHEN DRIVING ON WHYWAYANS SIDE STREETS, HIGH AND LOW SPEEDS. IT FEELS AS IF THE GEAR IS DROPPED FROM 5TH TO 1ST AND BACK.",
