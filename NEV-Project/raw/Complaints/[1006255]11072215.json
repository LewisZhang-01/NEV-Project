        "summary": "I RECEIVED A LETTER FROM FORD MOTOR COMPANY CONCERNING MY PICKUP TRUCK LISTED IN COMPLAINT.  IT ADDRESSED ISSUES WITH STEERING AND FRONT WHEEL VIBRATIONS AND OSCILLATIONS ON THE VEHICLE.  HOWEVER, IT JUST GIVES SUGGESTIONS SUCH AS CHECKING PROPER INFLATION OF TIRES, ETC.  HOWEVER, IN THE LAST 2-3 YEARS, I HAVE SPENT AN ESTIMATED $3000.00 ON REPAIRS TO THE FRONT SUSPENSION OF THIS VEHICLE DUE TO SEVERE \"DEATH WOBBLE\" ISSUES, WHICH SCARE THE HELL OUT OF YOU WHEN IT HAPPENS.  SINCE COMPLETION OF THE WORK COMPLETED, I STILL HAVE ISSUES WITH VIBRATIONS AND OSCILLATIONS WITH MY FORD F350.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY A RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR THIS PROBLEM. I FEEL THAT FORD COMPANY NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ISSUE AND MAKE GOOD TO THEIR LOYAL CUSTOMERS, INSTEAD OF SENDING ME WORTHLESS LETTERS OF ADVICE TO \"CHECK THE PROPER INFLATION OF MY TIRES, WHEN IN ACTUALITY, MY TIRES ARE FINE.....THE FORD TRUCK IS THE THING WITH ISSUES.  COME ON FORD.....FIX YOUR BAD!!!!!!!!",
