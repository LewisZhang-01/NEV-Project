        "summary": "2014 CHRYSLER TOWN AND COUNTRY - 70,000 MILES   ELECTRONICS STARTED MALFUNCTIONING WHILE DRIVING SHUTTING OFF ALL INSIDE CABIN ELECTRONICS INCLUDING PANEL, RADIO, A/C AND TURNING ON WINDSHIELD WIPERS.  AT FIRST IT DID NOT MALFUNCTION EVERY TIME BUT NOW IT DOESN'T RUN 1 MINUTE WITHOUT MALFUNCTIONING.  SOMETIMES MY BRAKE, HEAD AND SIGNAL LIGHTS WILL NOT WORK AND THE COMPLETE PANEL AND GAGES WILL NOT GO BACK UP INCLUDING GAS, SPEED RPM ETC.  UNTIL I SHUT DOWN THE CAR AND WAIT A FEW MINUTES TO TURN IT BACK ON MAKING IT COMPLETELY UNSAFE.    I BROUGHT IT TO THE LOCAL DEALER AND AS EXPECTED, AND MENTIONED BY OTHERS ONLINE, THEY SAID THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING LIKE IT.  THEY STATED THAT MY CAR HAS 9 DIFFERENT COMPUTERS AND THAT THEY ARE READING MALFUNCTIONS ON ALL OF THEM AND DECIDED TO RESET THE MODULE THAT CONTROLS ALL OF THE INTERIOR ELECTRONICS.  $100.00+ NOTHING CHANGED APART FROM THE FACT THAT IT IS NOW HAPPENING MORE FREQUENTLY.    I REFUSE TO GET INTO THE PATH OF SPENDING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON THIS REPAIR JUST ON THE GUESSING GAME OF REPLACING PART AFTER PART WITHOUT POSITIVE RESULTS.  PLEASE HELP!",
