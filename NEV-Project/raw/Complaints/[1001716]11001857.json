WHEN THIS HAPPENS, RPMS DO NOT RISE WHILE THE GAS PEDAL IS DEPRESSED AND THE VEHICLE BECOMES TOTALLY UNRESPONSIVE.     THIS PROBLEM BEGAN OCCURRING AFTER THE DEALER REPLACED THE CVT AND TORQUE CONVERTOR ' BOTH DEEMED BAD BY THE DEALER. VEHICLE HAS BEEN BACK TO THE DEALER ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS TO ADDRESS THIS CONCERN, BUT THE DEALERSHIP CANNOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM, AND THERE ARE NO CODES APPEARING DURING DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. THE PROBLEM IS ONGOING AND THERE HAS BEEN NO RESOLUTION. NISSAN CORPORATE HAS NOT FORMALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THIS TO BE A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM, BUT IS 'AWARE OF SOME CONCERNS'.",
