DURING DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY OR CITY STREET (AT ALL SPEEDS) THE ENGINE WOULD BEGIN TO MALFUNCTION WITHOUT WARNING AND THE MAXIMUM SPEED THAT COULD BE MET WAS ABOUT 10MPH WITH GAS FULLY ENGAGED. PULLINGNOVER AND RESTARTING THE VEHICLE WOULD OVERRIDE THIS FOR A SHORT TIME. IT STARTED TO OCCUR MORE FREQUENTLY TO THE POINT I WOULD HAVE TO RESTART MY CAR A APPROXIMATELY 15 TIMES TO MAKE A 9 MILE TRIP TO WORK. HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES DRIVING ON A HIGHWAY AT SPEEDS OF UP TO 65MPH AND ALMOST CAUSED ACCIDENTS SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE I COULD PULL OFF ON TO THE SHOULDER. EVENTUALLY AFTER MONTHS OF THIS OCCURRING AT RANDOM INTERVALS THE CAR SHUT OFF WHILE DRIVING RESULTING IN TOTAL LOSS OF ENGINE POWER AND STEERING ABILITY OF THE VEHICLE THANKFULLY ON A QUIET BACK STREET WHERE I WAS ABLE TO LEAVE IT AFTER PUSHING IT IN NEUTRAL AND HAVE IT TOWED. AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF BEING IN THE SHOP AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS LATER ITS RUNNING WITH A NEW ENGINE. MULTIPLE FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS WITH THE SAME VEHICLE MODEL  MAKE AND YEAR HAVE THIS ISSUE ALL AROUND 50K MILES.",
