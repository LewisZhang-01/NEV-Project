MY 2004 TOYOTA 4RUNNER DASHBOARD DID THE SAME THING, ONLY NOT AS EXTREME AS FALLING APART LIKE MY DODGE RAM 1500. TOYOTA DID THE RIGHT THING AND RECALLED THE DASHBOARD! THIS TRUCK WAS JUST PURCHASED FOR MY SON AND NOW THEY CAN'T AND WON'T REPLACE THE AIRBAG UNLESS WE PAY TO HAVE THE DASHBOARD REPLACED? IF THE MANUFACTURER OF DODGE DOESN'T DO THE SAME AND I OR ONE OF MY PASSENGERS IS HURT BECAUSE OF THE RECALL AIRBAG, YOU BEST BELIEVE THERE WILL BE A HUGE LAWSUIT COMING THEIR WAY!",
