BEFORE COMPLETELY UNABLE TO START, I WOULD HAVE TO TRY 3 OR MORE TIMES FOR IT TO START. FIRST TIME I CHANGED THE BATTERY AN  VEHICLE WAS OK FOR A WHILE BUT THEN STARTED FAILING TO START INTERMITTENTLY AND WOULD ONLY START AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS. I DO NOT MIND REPLACING THE STARTER BUT IT BOTHERS ME BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS ONLY 3-4 YEAR OLD AND BELIEVE REPLACING THE STARTER MAY NOT FIX THE PROBLEM IN THE LONG RUN AS IT WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLACED WITH THE SAME STARTERS THAT ARE FAILING. PLEASE HELP. THANKS.",
