        "summary": "IN JUNE 2013, I WAS DRIVING N ON I15 (APPROX 82 MILES FROM HOME. AFTER USING CRUISE CONTROL AROUND 80MPH, THE SPEED LIMIT CHANGED TO 65. AS I TAPPED THE BRAKE TO STOP CC, MY CAR ALMOST STOPPED TO A GRINDING HALT. THE CAR HAD 47000 MILES. AFTER I PANICKED FOR ABOUT A HALF HOUR BECAUSE I AM DISABLED, I FINALLY PUT IT IN D & IT WORKED. WHEN I RETURNED HOME, IT LITERALLY STOPPED PERMANENTLY IN MY DRIVEWAY. I CALLED A TOW TO TAKE TO FORD DEALERSHIP. I PAID FOR THE TOW AND OF COURSE ALMOST $200 TO TELL ME THE TRANSMISSION NEEDED REPAIRED! THIS WOULD  COST AROUND $3600! FORD HAS BEEN IGNORING ME FOR YEARS BECAUSE I FEEL THEY SHOULD PAY FOR TOWING, DIAGNOSTICS, REPAIRS AND CAR RENTALS. I HAVE RECEIVED NOTHING. NOT A LETTER FROM THE DEALERSHIP'S OWNER, NOTHING. I BOUGHT THIS CAR WITH EIGHT MILES ON THE ODOMETER & TOOK CARE OF IT SO IT WOULD LAST MANY YEARS. FORD HAS TREATED ME EXTREMELY UNFAIRLY & I'M STILL VERY ANGRY ABOUT THE MONEY I HAD TO SPEND! THANK YOU",
