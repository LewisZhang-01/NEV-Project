        "summary": "TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM PROBLEM. (TPMS PROBLEM)    ON A NEW 2017 HONDA ACCORD HYBRID SEDAN! AS AT 07/08/17.   TPM PROBLEM. I BOUGHT MY NEW 2017 HONDA ACCORD HYBRID  FOR ITS RELIABILITY. IN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS. TWO MICHILIN TIRES HAVE BLOWN OUT. BOTH FRONT PASSENGER AND REAR DRIVER SIDE. THE REAR ONE BLEW OUT WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY. IT WAS INITIALLY GIVING ME LOW TIRE PRESSURE WARNINGS. AFTER A WEEK OF TAKING IT TO THE DELEARSHIP I BOUGHT IT TO LOOK AT IT AND REPAIR, IT BLEW OUT UNEXPECTEDLY ON 07/06/17. I ALWAYS REPLACE THOSE TIRE WITH MY OWN MONEY. THE DELEARSHIP TOLD ME THE TIRES DON'T COME WITH WARRANTY! WHAT? NEW TIRES FROM MICHILIN? INCREDIBLY UNBELIEVABLE RIGHT. I HAVE PERSONALLY CONTACTED MICHILIN TODAY 07/08/17 AND THEY SAID THEY'LL GIVE ME A CALL.   I SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT AT THE DEALERSHIP ON 07/08/17. THEY SAID THEY HAD REPAIRED AND TEST DROVE IT. IN LESS THAN 5 MILES OF DRIVING AVERAGE OF 45MPH, THE SYSTEM READ. \"TPM PRONLEM\". TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING PROBLEM. WITH THE WARNING SIGN OF LOW TIRE PRESSURE INSCRIBED ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL.     WITH SO MUCH DISAPPOINTMENT AND UNPREDICTABILITY THAT I WRITE THIS LETTER. NOT KNOWING WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT WITH MY NEW 2017 HONDA ACCORD HYBRID TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM PROBLEM.     NOT EVEN COUNTING THE DAMAGES CAUSED: EMOTIONAL PAIN WITH THE LOVE I DEVELOPED FOR MY VEHICLE, THE DISAPPOINTMENT, THE FINANCIAL COST-THE CAR IS ACTUALLY NOT EQUIPPED WITH A SPARE TIRE. ANY TIME THE TIRE BLOWS OUT, I NEED TO EMERGENTLY REPAIR IT WITH MY OWN OUT OF POCKET MONEY UNEXPECTEDLY. UNSAFENESS- THE FIRST MICHILIN TIRE BLEW OUT UNEXPECTEDLY AT NIGHT AFTER 10 PM AT A LOCATION IN CHICAGO I HAD NO IDEA WITH. I HAD TO DRIVE IT AND PARK IT IN DARKNESS AT A SHELL FILLING STATION WHERE IT COULD HAVE BEEN TOWED. I HAD TO TAKE THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION MORE THAN AN HOUR BACK TO HOME WHERE I LIVED. SO UNSAFE.",
