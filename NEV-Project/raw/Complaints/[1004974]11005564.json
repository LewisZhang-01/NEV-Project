VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION WHEN NOTICED HISSING SOUND AND BRAKE FOOT PEDAL GOING TO THE FLOOR WHEN APPLYING BREAKS. WENT IN FIRST IN APRIL AND BRAKE BOOSTER SYSTEM WAS REPLACED. RECALL WAS NEWER MODEL EDGES SO WE HAD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET. WENT BACK IN LESS THAN 90 DAYS LATER IN JULY BECAUSE BRAKES WERE NOT FILLING RIGHT AGAIN. MASTER CYLINDER LEAK WAS FOUND. WAS NOT FOUND THE FIRST TIME SO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT GAVE US A MANAGER DISCOUNT. BRAKE BOOSTER BLEED AND MASTER CYLINDER LEAK. REPLACED BRAKE BOOSTER SYSTEM ($961.38) AND MASTER CYLINDER ($290.23).     I FEEL THAT THE BREAK BOOSTER SYSTEM AND CONNECTION TO MASTER CYLINDER SHOULD BE PART OF RECALL FOR THIS MODEL EDGE. SINCE BRAKE ISSUES WERE NOT FOUND IN AN EARLIER MASTER SERVICE (I CAN SEND THAT INVOICE AS WELL), I THINK THE BRAKE SYSTEM WAS BOUND TO FAIL AS I HAVE READ IN THE RECALL FOR NEWER MODELS.",
