        "summary": "CALLED TOYOTA 2 YEARS AGO ABOUT RUST ON MY TRUCKS FRAME NEAR THE REAR LEAF SPRING MOUNTING AREA. WAS BLOWN OFF BY TOYOTA CUSTOMER CARE. IN DECEMBER WAS DRIVING AND THE FRAME RAILS LITERALLY SNAPPED AN BOWED, THE ONLY THING THAT SAVED MY LIFE WHILE DRIVING 70MPH, ON THE INTERSTATE 70 BETWEEN HAGERSTOWN MD AND HANCOCK MD, HOME FROM WORK WAS THE BED CONTACTING THE CAB OF THE TRUCK AND MIRACULOUSLY HOLDING HOLDING IT UP AND ALLOWING ME TO GET IT SAFELY OFF THE ROAD AND CALL MY MECHANIC. THE SHEET METAL OF THE TRUCK IS RUST FREE AND IN GOOD CONDITION. THE FRAME IS A TOTAL LOSS. THE TRUCK WAS AT TOYOTA IN 2010 AND 2011 FOR FRAME INSPECTIONS. THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THESE TRUCKS AND NOW IM TOLD THAT TOYOTA WONT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. IF THEY WOULD HAVE FIXED IT OR ADDRESSED MY CONCERNS IN 2018 OR EVEN 2019 I WOULDNT HAVE NEARLY CRASHED MY TRUCK. THE IDEA OF A SAFETY CAMPAIGN IS THAT THEY KNOW THERE IS AN ISSUE, THEIR WAS A CLASS ACTION SUIT, THEY HAVE FRAMES AVAILABLE AND THEY NEED TO REPLACE MY FRAME ON MY TRUCK AND MAKE IT SAFE AGAIN. IT IS THE ONLY TRUCK I HAVE I USED IT TO TAKE CARE OF MY DOGS AND MY THE ROADS TO MY HOME ARE VERY STEEP AND A 2WD OR FRONT WHEEL DRIVE WILL NOT MAKE IT IN SNOWY OR RAINY WEATHER. TOYOTA'S CASE # IS 2102242008, PHONE NUMBER TO CALL IS 1800-331-4331.",
