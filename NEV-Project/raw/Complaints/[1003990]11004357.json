        "summary": "MY 2007 MERCEDES CLK63 HAS FOR SOME 5 OR SO YEARS NOW SMELLED STRONGLY OF GASOLINE UPON FILLING UP. IRONICALLY THE ODOR IS STRONGEST WHILE STANDING OUTSIDE OF THE CAR ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE. THE SMELL DOES SUBSIDE AS THE FUEL LEVEL DECREASES SOMEWHAT. THE DEALER (EURO MOTORCARS BETHESDA (MD) ATTEMPTED TO REPAIR THE PROBLEM 5 OR SO YEARS AGO BUT TO NO AVAIL (EVEN THOUGH I DID PAY FOR THE REPAIRS), THE ISSUE WAS ONLY TEMPORARILY RESOLVED. MY SERVICE ADVISOR LOOKED AT, AND PRONOUNCED MY FUEL PUMP AND GASKET AS BEING THE CULPRITS. A SEPARATE REVIEW BY A SUBSEQUENT ADVISOR SAID THE SAME. THE SMELL IS SO STRONG AS TO BE AN EMBARRASSMENT (AT LEAST) FOR WHAT IS OTHERWISE A SUPER CAR WITH ONLY 65000 MILES ON IT. AT WORST, I'M AFRAID THAT A SPARK OR SOMETHING CUD SET IT OFF (NOTE: WE PARK IT BOTH AT HOME AND AT OFFICE IN A GARAGE STRUCTURE WHERE THE SMELL, AND IT SEEMS THE DANGER, IS ONLY MAGNIFIED). I WAS MOST RECENTLY QUOTED A PRICE OF $1200 TO FIX THIS PROBLEM FOR WHAT WILL BE A 2ND TIME.",
