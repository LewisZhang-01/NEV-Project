        "summary": "I RECEIVED A INTERIM SAFETY RECALL ON 6/30/17 (ATTACHED). ON 6/21/17 WHILE TRAVELLING ON THE HIGHWAY (RT. 80) GOING 70MPH THE ENGINE LOST ALL POWER. THERE WAS NO KNOCKING SOUND OR WARNING LIGHT AS THE NOTICE HAD STATED WOULD BE AN INDICATOR TO A POSSIBLE PROBLEM. I LUCKILY WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD BEFORE THE CAR COMPLETELY STOPPED OPERATING .FORTUNATELY I WAS TRAVELLING IN THE LEFT LANE. HAD I BEEN IN ANY OTHER LANE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WAY I COULD HAVE PULLED OVER THE VEHICLE. THE ENGINE LOST POWER THAT QUICKLY WITHOUT WARNING. I HAD TO HAVE TO CAR TOWED OFF THE HIGHWAY AND CONTACTED KIA. A CASE WAS OPENED AND I WAS ADVISED THAT THE CAR WOULD HAVE TO BE INSPECTED TO DETERMINE IF IT WAS DUE TO THE RECALL THAT THE ENGINE STOPPED. I RECEIVED A CALL THE NEXT DAY THAT INDEED THE ENGINE WAS PART OF THE RECALL AND I WOULD BE RECEIVING A NEW ENGINE. KIA HAS NOT COMMUNICATED WITH ME IN REGARDS TO THE ETA OF THE REPAIR. I CALLED THE DEAL WHO HAD NO IDEA WHEN THE CAR WOULD BE REPAIRED. AFTER CONTACTING KIA I WAS GIVEN AN ETA OF 7/15/17.   CASE # 12385542",
