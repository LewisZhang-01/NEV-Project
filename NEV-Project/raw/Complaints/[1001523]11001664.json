I GOT A LETTER FROM TOYOTA STATING THAT THEY WILL FIX THE EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION ISSUES UNDER EXTENDED WARRANTY MAINTENANCE. BUT WHEN I CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP, THEY ARE SAYING THERE IS RUST ON THE CAR AND THEY WILL FIX IT ONLY IF I PAY THE COST THAT MIGHT BE RANGING FROM500 DOLLARS TO MORE THAN 1000 DOLLARS. I HAVE CONTACTED TOYOTA EXECUTIVE OFFICE TO DISCUSS THE MATTER BUT SORRY TO INFORM YOU ALL THAT I GOT A VERY HARSH TREATMENT FROM THE EXECUTIVE REP. SHE WAS NOT EVEN READY TO REPLY MY EMAILS AND INFORMED ME THAT SHE WILL ONLY TALK TO ME THROUGH PHONE, NOT THRU EMAIL. AFTER A SERIOUS DISCUSSION OVER THE PHONE, SHE FINALLY REPLIED MY EMAILS BUT SAID THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING TO FIX MY ISSUES. I FEEL TERRIBLE NOW. I AM CHANGING MY CAR OIL EVERY 1000 MILES AND TOYOTA IS NOT READY TO DO ANYTHING TO FIX MY ISSUES. I AM SCARED THAT MY CAR WILL STOP RUNNING SOON. I EVEN COPIED MY MAIL TO THE PRESIDENT AND NEVER GOT A REPLY FROM HIM ALSO REGARDING THE HARSH TREATMENT FROM THE REP.",
