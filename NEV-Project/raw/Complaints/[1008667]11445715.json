        "summary": "The autopilot feature engaged and took control of the car. I could not wrestle control back even after I turn the car off and back on. I had to fight the car for 32 miles. From Fort Lauderdale to Boca Raton, FL.   This happened for the first time last night 12/31 at 12:01 am. And it happened again at around 12:20 am.   There was no warning lights only a lamp turned on after it had engaged. It also started showing the two lines marking the lane where I was traveling. It made it very hard to change lanes as I had to fight the auto pilot.   I was driving on HWY US 1. If this had happened on I-95 (the other preferred route) I am sure we would have had a crash, possibly with lost of life.",
