QUICKLY, I SHIFTED INTO DRIVE AND MOVED SLOWLY TO LEVEL GROUND. THE BRAKE PEDAL REMAINED HARD, BUT STOPPED WHEN EXERTING TREMENDOUS PRESSURE, AKA \"STANDING ON THE BREAK.\" I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO A CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP FOR REPAIR. THE PROBLEM WAS A FAILED BRAKE ASSIST VACUUM PUMP. APPARENTLY, THERE IS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST GM FOR THIS VERY PROBLEM.",
