I COULD NO LONGER ACCELERATE. SO ONCE I WENT TO A MECHANIC SHOP, THEY READ THE CODES AND IT SAID I NEEDED MY CAMSHAFT POSITION CENSOR FIXED. PROBLEM OCCURRED AGAIN DAYS LATER. THEY THEN SAID IT WAS THE THROTTLE BODY, THEY PUT IN A NEW ONE. THE PROBLEM OCCURRED AGAIN, MY CAR ACTUALLY STALLED WHILE I WAS TURNING IN A INTERSECTION. THAT IS DANGEROUS, ESPECIALLY WHEN MY DAUGHTER IS IN THE CAR. I WENT BACK AND THEY HAD TO KEEP MY CAR FOR A WEEK BECAUSE THEY SAID IT WAS MY ECM AND THEY HAD TO ORDER THE PART. I GOT MY CAR BACK ON THURSDAY JUNE 29TH, 2017 AND MY CAR STALLED AGAIN ON JUNE 30TH. I AM QUITE FRUSTRATED AT THIS POINT BECAUSE I'M NOTICING THAT THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE AND DODGE IS NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE. SOMEONE WILL AND PROBABLY ALREADY HAS DIED BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.",
