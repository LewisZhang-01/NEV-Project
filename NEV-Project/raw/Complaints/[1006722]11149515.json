LIGHT CAME BACK ON. SAME MECHANIC DID SMOKE TEST AND REPLACED PURGE VALVE STATING IT MUST HAVE BEEN FAULTY. LIGHT CAME BACK ON. CHEVY DEALER REPLACED PURGE VALVE. LIGHT CAME BACK ON. LAST MECHANIC REPLACED FUEL SENSOR. LIGHT CAME BACK ON AND THEY STATED IT NOW NEEDS A PURGE VALVE. IN ADDITION, DASH STABILITY LIGHT COMES ON BUT DOES NOT GO OF WHEN BUTTON PUSHED. DVD PLAYER ALSO SEEMS TO BE CONSTANTLY WHIRRING. HOWEVER, MAIN CONCERN IS STILL THE ENGINE LIGHT THAT NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW HOW TO FIX AFTER I'VE SPENT OVER $1K FOR SEVERAL PURGE VALVES, SMOKE TEST AND FUEL SENSOR. THESE PROBLEMS ONGOING FOR OVER A YEAR AND NO ONE IS ABLE TO RESOLVE!",
