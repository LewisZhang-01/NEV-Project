        "summary": "HAD THE VEHICLE ALIGNED ABOUT ONE YEAR AGO DUE TO IT PULLING TO THE RIGHT. THE STEERING WAS STILL SLOPPY AND CONTINUED TO DRIFT TO THE RIGHT. WELL COME TO FIND OUT THAT THE TIE ROD ON DRIVERS SIDE WAS FROZEN AND COULD NOT BE ADJUSTED. SO A YEAR LATER I DECIDED TO HAVE THE TIE ROD REPLACED SO IT WOULD DRIVE STRAIGHT AND TRUE. AFTER FURTHER INSPECTION IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION  THAT THE STEERING KNUCKLE HAD A CRACK ALMOST COMPLETELY THROUGH. I HAVE NEVER HIT ANYTHING IN THAT VEHICLE TO CAUSE A CRACK IN THE STEERING KNUCKLE. THE VEHICLE CURRENTLY HAS 37000 MILES ON IT. I KNOW THE POLICE EDITION HAS A RECALL FOR THE SAME PROBLEM. CHEVROLET  SHOULD HAVE RECALLED ALL IMPALAS FROM 2011 TO AT LEAST INSPECT THE VEHICLES FOR THIS ISSUE. IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED TO FIND OUT HOW MANY 2011 IMPALAS HAD THIS SAME DEFECT.",
