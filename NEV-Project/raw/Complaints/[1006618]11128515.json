MY 18 YEAR OLD SON WAS DRIVING (MY 21 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS A PASSENGER) MY CAR IN A BUSY 4 LANE TRAFFIC IN UTAH WHEN THE CAR LOST ALL POWER!  I AM JUST GRATEFUL THAT MY CHILDREN DID NOT DIE.  I BOUGHT THIS CAR BECAUSE KIA'S ARE SUPPOSED TO RUN FOREVER.  I DID REGULAR MAINTENANCE  ON MY CAR AND NOW I AM LOOKING AT $5,000 TO REPAIR MY CAR!  I CALLED KIA HEADQUARTERS AND THE ONLY THING I GOT WAS TREATED BADLY!  HOW COULD THIS BE MY FAULT?  AN INTERESTING THING IS THAT A CO-WORKER OF MINE HAD A 2014 KIA THAT DID THE EXACT SAME THING AT 110,00 MILES! SHE ALSO HAD TO PAY THE MONEY AND KIA TREATED HER BADLY AS WELL.  I NEED HELP TO PAY FOR THE REPAIRS FROM KIA IT IS THEIR FAULT!",
