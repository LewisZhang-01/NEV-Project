IT HAS TURNED OFF ON ME WHILE DRIVING AT ABOUT 35 MPH AND ANOTHER AT 25 MPH KINDA SCARED TO DRIVE IT. YOU THINK WHEN YOU PAY FOR QUALITY YOU SHOULD GET IT, NOT HAVING TO $5500 FOR A CAMSHAFT LIFTER REPLACEMENT  IN UNDER THE FIRST 50K MILES THAT' INSANE! PLEASE SEND FEED BACK IN GOING TO TALK TO LAWYERS AND GET THERE VIEW ON THE SITUATION BECAUSE THERE'S MORE THEN JUST A COUPLE WITH THIS PROBLEM AND SOME WITH VARY LOW MILES. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME MUCH APPRECIATED  .",
