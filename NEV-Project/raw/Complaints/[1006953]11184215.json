THE FIRST PROBLEM WE STARTED TO SEE WAS THE WHOLE SCREEN TURNED OFF WE ARE ABLE TO PLAY MUSIC BUT ONLY RADIO STATION THAT WAS SAVED. WE ARE UNABLE TO TUNE/SEEK TO A NEW RADIO STATION. THEN WE STARTED TO NOTICE DURING THE RAINY SEASON THAT WATER WOULD ENTER INTO OUR CAR. AFTER MANY TRIES OF SOLVING THIS ISSUE, IT IS STILL HAPPENING TO OUR CAR. THE SECTION WHERE THE PETALS ARE ALWAYS WET AND WE HAVE CLOSED THE SUNROOF AND THE COVER BUT, NOTHING SEEMS TO WORK. NOW TODAY THE CHECK ENGINE TURN ON AND ALSO THE OIL IN THE DASHBOARD BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL. WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE CAR AND HOPE TO SEE CHANGES SOON FROM YOU. THANK YOU FOR READING THE ISSUE WE CONSTANTLY FACE.",
