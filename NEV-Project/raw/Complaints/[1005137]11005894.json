        "summary": "WE BOUGHT OUR 2017 HYUNDAI SANTA FE SPORT USED; IT HAD ONLY 11,000 MILES ON IT. DRIVING HOME FROM THE DEALERSHIP, I NOTICED THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD SHUDDER VIOLENTLY WHEN I TURNED THE STEERING WHEEL, AND AS THE STEERING WHEEL RETURNED TO CENTER AFTER A TURN. THIS MAKES IT CLOSE TO IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL THE STEERING WHEEL, AND NEARLY GOT ME INTO A FEW ACCIDENTS SINCE I WAS UNABLE TO CONTROL THE STEERING WHEEL. THIS SUGGESTS THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH THE STEERING COLUMN OR WORSE; THE STEERING RACK. IF THERE IS SLIPPING GOING ON IN THE STEERING COLUMN OR RACK, IT COULD BE DANGEROUS, AS THE VEHICLE COULD HAVE DIFFICULTY STEERING, OR LOSE THE ABILITY TO STEER COMPLETELY WHEN IN DRIVE. I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED SUCH AN ISSUE WHILE DRIVING ANY OTHER VEHICLE.",
