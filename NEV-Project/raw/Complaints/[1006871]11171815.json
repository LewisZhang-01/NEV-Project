        "summary": "BOUGHT A USED 09 CAMRY. EVERYTHING SEEMED FINE UNTIL 2 MONTHS AFTER DRIVING THE CAR WE NOTICED IT WAS BURNING THROUGH OIL, 2.5+ QTS PER 1000 MILES. DID AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST AND FAILED ONLY TO BE TOLD THAT THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE IT'S OUT OF WARRANTY (PAST THE 10 YR MARK). I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'D EVEN PERFORM THE OIL CONSUMPTION TEST KNOWING THEY COULDN'T HELP IF IT INDEED FAILED BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT WAS OUT OF WARRANTY THEY EXPLAINED THAT THE OIL CONSUMPTION TEST IS \"WARRANTY PROTOCOL\" BEFORE ANY REPAIRS ARE MADE...   I CALLED THE HEADQUARTERS OFFICE AND SPOKE TO 2 REPS WHO BOTH DOCUMENTED MY ISSUE AND SAID, \"WE'LL FORWARD YOUR COMPLAINT TO OUR MANAGER AND CREATE A CASE... I HONESTLY BELIEVE WE SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THIS\", ONLY TO HEAR BACK FROM THE MANAGER WHO LEAD ME ON DURING THE CALL BY SAYING, \"IT'S OUR JOB HERE AT TOYOTA TO SERVICE CUSTOMERS IN NEED. I'M FAMILIAR WITH YOUR SITUATION AFTER READING YOUR CASE NOTES. YOU DID NOTHING WRONG AND WEREN'T NEGLIGENT. LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO HELP YOU\". THEN LITERALLY THE NEXT SENTENCE THE GUY SAID, \"I'M SORRY, WE CAN'T HELP YOU\". I ASKED HIM WHY HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO HELP ME, KNOWING THE DETAILS OF THE CASE WHICH EXPLAINED THAT I WANTED TO HAVE THIS OIL CONSUMPTION ISSUE FIXED. HE LITERALLY SAID, \"I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE RESOLUTION YOU WERE SEARCHING FOR AND I KNEW YOU WERE OUT OF WARRANTY FOR THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. BUT BECAUSE IT'S A UNIQUE SITUATION AND I CAN MAKE THINGS HAPPEN ON MY END, I DECIDED TO OFFER ASSISTANCE\".  YET HE DID NOTHING. NOW I'M OUT $5500",
