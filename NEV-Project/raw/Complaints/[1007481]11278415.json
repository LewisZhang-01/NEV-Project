I COULD BARELY HOLD ON TO THE STEERING WHEEL BECAUSE IT WAS SHAKING SO VIOLENTLY UNTIL I HAD SLOWED ALMOST TO A STOP. I THEN PULLED OFF THE ROAD AND EXAMINED THE FRONT END OF THE TRUCK AND DID NOT FIND ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY NOTHING WAS BROKE OR LOSE THAT I COULD FIND. THE INCIDENT WAS VERY UNNERVING AND I NOW AM VERY APPREHENSIVE AND DO NOT TRUST THIS VEHICLE.",
