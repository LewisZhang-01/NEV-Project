BRAKING IS NOT SOLID, IS SLOW, AND STEERING WHEEL SHAKE RESULTS WHEN WARPING OCCURS.  BRAKES DO NOT ADEQUATELY GRAB.  BRAKES ALSO ARE SLOW TO REACT WITH ABS ON CORNERS, MAKE SOUNDS AND BRAKES ARE SUBSTANDARD FOR MODEL.  ALL OF THIS HAS HAPPENED UNDER AT 15K AND 23K IN MY CAR.  DEALER SAID IT''S A KNOWN ISSUE AND TELLS PEOPLE TO DOWNSHIFT (IN AN AUTOMATIC!) INSTEAD OF BRAKE.  MANY COMPLAINTS IN INTERNET FORMULA REGARDING THE SAME.  PEOPLE COULD GET SERIOUSLY HURT WITH THESE ISSUES.  NEEDS TO BE RECALLED FOR BRAKES AND A STRONGER BRAKING SYSTEM ISSUED.",
