Well today after picking up vehicle I was informed my rear sub frame of vehicle is severely corroded and unsafe to drive, rear body bushings are basically holding up by nothing. After visiting website this seems to be a common finding this year. My thoughts would be they stop selling this year and manner of vehicle due to safety concerns",
