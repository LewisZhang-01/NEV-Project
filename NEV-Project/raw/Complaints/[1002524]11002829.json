THE LAST TIME WE WERE AT THE DEALERS FOR REPAIR, MAY 19, 2017, WE WERE TOLD THAT THEY HAVE BACKORDERED PARTS FOR TSB- 16-0166.  WE STILL HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THE DEALER.  MY WIFE GETS SORE THROATS AND BURNING EYES WHEN IN THE VEHICLE. THE VEHICLE GETS THE EXHAUST FUMES INSIDE.  THE STRONGEST IS WHEN GOING UPHILL OR A FAST START.  ALSO, WHEN STOPPED IN ONE SPOT FOR LONG.  WE HAVE TO DRIVE WITH THE WINDOWS OPEN TO AIR THE VEHICLE OUT VERY OFTEN.  SOMETIMES THE CAR INTERIOR SMELLS AND OUR CLOTHES SMELL.   CAN ANYTHING BE DONE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM?  IT IS A VERY EXPENSIVE VEHICLE THAT IS MAKING US SICK.    SOME INVOICES ATTACHED.  OTHERS WOULD NOT GO THROUGH CORRECTLY.
