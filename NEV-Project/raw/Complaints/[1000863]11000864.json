THE NOTICE MENTIONED PARTS MAY BE AVAILABLE STARTING IN JUNE 2017. I FEEL THAT THIS SHORTING CONDITION THAT MAY CAUSE MY AIRBAGS TO NOT DEPLOY IS A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN AND A REMEDY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE BY NOW. IN THE MEANTIME, I'M DRIVING AROUND IN THIS VEHICLE AND RISKING MY LIFE DOING SO. THIS MATTER IS NOT BEING REMEDIED IN A TIMELY MANNER. I AM VERY UPSET WITH FCA ON HOW THIS IS BEING HANDLED.",
