A FEW DAYS LATER I DROVE IT TO A LOCATION WHERE I STAYED FOR 2 HOURS, LEFT AND GOT HOME WHERE I STAYED FOR A FEW MINUTES. CAME BACK OUT TO USE THE VEHICLE BUT THE ENGINE DIDN'T 'TURN OVER' . CALLED THE SERVICE BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS THE BATTERY. THEY RE-BOOT THE CAR & I LET THE ENGINE RUN FOR 1/2 HR. PER HIS INSTRUCTION. THE WENT TO A DRIVE THRU AND DECIDED TO HEAD HOME BUT SHORTLY AFTER THE JEEP SHUTS OFF AT A STOP LIGHT.  I WAITED 5 MIN THEN RESTART AND HEADED HOME WITH MY HAZARD LIGHT FLASHING. I CALLED THE DEALER AND GOT 'AN AVAILABLE' APPOINTMENT FOUR DAY THEREAFTER.",
