THE STITCHING (OR WHATEVER MATERIAL IS USED) HAS STARTED TO DISINTEGRATE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE DASHBOARD, WHERE THE AIRBAG IS HOUSED. I'VE BEEN HOPING THE RECALL WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETED BEFORE NOW, SO I WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE THE CAR TAKEN IN TWICE TO BE FIXED: ONCE FOR THE DETERIORATING DASHBOARD AROUND THE PASSENGER AIRBAG, AND A SECOND TIME TO HAVE THE AIRBAG REPLACED WHEN THE PARTS  FOR THE RECALL BECOME AVAILABLE. I'M VERY CONCERNED TO KEEP DRIVING THE CAR, AND ALSO FOR THE RESALE VALUE, IF I WANTED TO SELL THE CAR DUE TO THIS ISSUE STILL NOT BEING RESOLVED.",
