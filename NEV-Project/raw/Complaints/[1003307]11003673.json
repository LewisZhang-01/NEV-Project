THIS JUST SO HAPPENED TO OCCUR WHILE IN TRAFFIC AND IN A CURVE BUT FORTUNATELY I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN CONTROL. I DID NOT KNOW AT THE TIME THAT THIS WAS THE THROTTLE BODY AND ASSUMED IT WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE TRANSMISSION. AFTER THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THE ISSUE AND THE REPAIR COST I DECIDED TO RESEARCH IT AND IT LOOKS LIKE THIS IS A PRETTY COMMON OCCURRENCE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS ISSUE MADE INTO A RECALL FOR SAFETY PURPOSES AND FOR FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE TO OTHER FORD OWNERS.",
