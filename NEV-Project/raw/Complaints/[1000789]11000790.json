FOUND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON INTERNET DATED MARCH 7, 2017 - \"NISSAN ALTIMA AND MAXIMA STEERING LOCK PROBLEM WILL BE FIXED FOR FREE AFTER THE AUTOMAKER ANNOUNCED A 'SERVICE CAMPAIGN' FOR 243,000  MODEL YEAR 2009-2010 NISSAN ALTIMA, ALTIMA COUPE, ALTIMA HYBRID AND MAXIMA CARS.  ALTHOUGH NOT A RECALL, THE SERVICE CAMPAIGN WILL FIX STEERING LOCKS (ECLS) THAT LOCK THE STEERING WHEEL WHEN THE ALTIMA AND MAXIMA CARS ARE PARKED AND TURNED OFF. HOWEVER, THOSE STEERING LOCKS HAVE SERIOUS PROBLEMS AND CAN LEAVE OWNERS AND THEIR CARS SITTING IN PARKING LOTS OR DRIVEWAYS.\"  \"NISSAN HAS AGREED TO REPLACE THE STEERING LOCK WITH AN ELECTRONIC STEERING COLUMN BOX AT NO CHARGE FOR PARTS AND LABOR, A JOB THAT SHOULD TAKE AN AUTHORIZED NISSAN DEALER ABOUT AN HOUR TO COMPLETE.\"  \"THE ELECTRONIC STEERING COLUMN BOX WILL REPLACE THE ESCL ASSEMBLY BUT WILL NO LONGER LOCK THE STEERING WHEEL WHEN THE CAR IS PARKED AND TURNED OFF.  THE AUTOMAKER SAYS THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKING FUNCTION IS NOT NECESSARY BECAUSE THE ALTIMA AND MAXIMA ARE EQUIPPED WITH ANTI-THEFT IMMOBILIZERS TO HELP PREVENT THEFT.\"   \"IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR REPAIRS TO THE STEERING COLUMN LOCK, NISSAN WILL REIMBURSE WHAT YOU SPENT AS LONG AS YOU CAN SHOW PROOF OF REPAIRS.  IF THOSE REPAIRS WERE ABOVE $1,000., YOU'LL NEED TO SHOW PROOF OF OWNERSHIP OF THE CAR.\"    PLEASE ADD THIS TO COMPLAINT #11000784 FILED A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE THIS ONE.",
