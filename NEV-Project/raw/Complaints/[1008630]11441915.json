        "summary": "There was a service board recall on the brake vacuum pump.  It regularly gets corroded and seizes up.  Ford said they\u2019d replace it up to 150,000 miles or 10 years.  They know it\u2019s a problem and will continue to go bad but doesn\u2019t offer a fix for it.  At any point, a person can loose power brakes and hit something.  I almost rear ended someone because I was unaware of this issue.  It had been fixed by Ford and is now bad again.  They want $6-700 for a part that can go bad yearly and without notice.  Instead of replacing a part, coming up with a fix would have been high priority.  I doubt many Ford owners know their part is bad until it\u2019s too late.  I\u2019ve looked for fixes but I\u2019m not engineer and I\u2019m sure Ford has some good ones.",
