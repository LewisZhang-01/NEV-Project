        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING THE CAR WOULD LOSE ACCELERATION. THE FIRST TIME IT HAD HAPPEN IT WAS AROUND APRIL 2017 ON A HOT DAY. I THOUGHT MAYBE ME TURNING THE AIR ON PLUS WITH THE HEAT THAT IT WAS THE REASON FOR THE MALFUCTION, BUT THEN IT DID IT AGAIN A FEW DAYS LATER WHILE I WAS TURNING ONTO A BUSY INTERSECTION. I TOOK IT TO A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE TO ASK IF HE HAD ANY KNOWN SOLUTIONS TO WHY I AM LOSING ACCELERATION WHILE DRIVING. BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW OF ANY. SO FOR A WHILE IT WAS DRIVING NORMAL...AT LEAST I THOUGHT. MY DAUGHTER HAD USED THE VEHICLE AND I FORGOT TO TELL HER ABOUT THE ACCELERATION ISSUE, BUT SHE ALMOST GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT DUE TO THE LOST OF ACCELERATION. I THEN STARTED PAYING MORE ATTENTION AND WAS GOING TO TAKE IT SOMEWHERE PROFESSIONAL TO GET IT LOOKED AT.UNFORTUNATELY I DID NOT GET IT LOOKED AT FAST ENOUGH AS THE ACCELERATION WENT OUT AGAIN AND CAUSED ME TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT. AS I WAS DRIVING AND COMING AROUND A CURVE THE ACCELERATION ONCE AGAIN LEFT AND AS I HAVE DONE IN THE PAST HIT THE PEDAL MULTIPLE TIMES TO TRY TO GET IT TO REV UP SO THAT I CAN DRIVE. ONLY THIS TIME AND AFTER HITTING THE PEDAL MULTIPLE TIMES IT JERKED AND REV HARD WHICH STARTLED ME AND I LOSS CONTROL OF THE CAR. MY CAR FLIPPED OVER 3 TIMES. BY THE GRACE OF GOD I SURVIVED. PUZZLED AND TRYING TO GET MY SELF BACK ON MY FEET I STARTED TO RESEARCH WHAT POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE BEEN WRONG WITH THAT CAR ONLY TO LEARN THAT I WAS NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO EXPERIENCED THIS WITH SENTRAS. I AM GLAD OTHERS WAS SAFE, BUT I ALSO FEEL THAT WHEN I PURCHASED THIS CAR FROM CARMAX THAT ANY AND ALL RECALLS SHOULD HAVE BEEN POINTED OUT TO ME. OR AT LEAST SOMETHING FROM NISSAN DUE TO ME BEING A NEW OWNER POINTING OUT ANY ISSUES THEY HAD WITH THESE CARS. THIS NOT ONLY TRAUMATIZED ME IT ALSO CAUSE ME TO BE LABELED WITH INSURANCE COMPAINES AS (AT FAULT) DRIVER. MEANING MY INSURANCE PAYMENTS HAVE SKYROCKETED. ..UPDATED 08/04/17 *BF  UPDATED 08/07/17 *BF      *CN  *JS",
