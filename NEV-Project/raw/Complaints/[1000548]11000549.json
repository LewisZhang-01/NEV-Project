PULLED OFF OF HWY AND SHUT VEHICLE OFF FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES AND NO LONGER EXPERIENCED THIS ISSUE.     2ND INCIDENT: DRIVING ON INTERSTATE 80 IN CA  IN 95-100 DEGREE WEATHER. GOT OFF FREEWAY AND CAR LOST POWER AGAIN THIS TIME NOT GOING OVER 5 MPH.     TOOK VEHICLE TO NISSAN DEALER FOR DIAGNOSTICS. THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE PROBLEM WHEN DRIVING BUT \"MILEAGE IN\" WAS THE SAME AS \"MILEAGE OUT\" WHICH TELLS ME THEY DIDN'T DRIVE VERY FAR IF AT ALL. THEY PUT IT ON DIAGNOSTIC MACHINE AND GOT A CODE SAYING \"CVT A AT 4\" AND \"CVT B AT 7\" CVT HAS BEEN OVERHEATED. RECOMMEND REPLACE VALVE BODY AND INSTALL EXTERNAL COOLER FOR CONCERN.     I'VE READ MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT SAME ISSUE WITH NISSAN CVT TRANSMISSION.",
