        "summary": "Due to the deterioration of the headlight assembly and the reflectors, my headlights do not give me enough light to safely see after dark without using the bright lights. I have to drive with them on bright all the time, even in oncoming traffic, or risk incident or accident. To date I have experienced only minor, thankfully, incident. I have missed turns and even missed the road and drove off the roadway when making turns off the main road. I have not sustained damage and was lucky that there was no traffic following closely as I have, in several instances, had to stop abruptly to avoid damaging my vehicle. I also very narrowly missed seeing a person walking along the side of the road where no sidewalk was available because the dim lights did not fall on the person. I took the vehicle to Cadillac of Knoxville today, Jan.13, 2022, and was told that even brighter light bulbs will not help. They wanted to charge me $2280.00 plus tax to replace the headlight assembly that Cadillac is aware of the deterioration. This vehicle has only 57,701 miles on it, it is an upscale vehicle, yet I cannot safely drive it after dark. Cadillac needs to be held responsible for replacing the headlight assembly. I see there are many of the same complaint here and this needs correcting before someone is seriously injured or killed.",
