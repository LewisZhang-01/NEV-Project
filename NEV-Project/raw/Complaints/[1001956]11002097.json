WHEN I TURN THE KEY TO START THE CAR NOTHING WILL HAPPEN. BY ACCIDENT I PRESSED THE LOCK/ALARM SET ON MY KEY WHILE SITTING IN THE CAR. SO I UNLOCKED THE CAR (STILL SITTING IN IT) AND TRIED TO RE-START THE CAR, AND IT STARTED RIGHT UP. I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS AT LEAST 4 TIMES NOW WITH MORE FREQUENCY AND DID THE SAME THING TO START THE CAR. IT HAS WORKED EVERY TIME, BUT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO RELY ON.",
