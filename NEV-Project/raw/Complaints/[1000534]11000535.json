THIS MALFUNCTION OCCURS WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STATIONARY, IN MOTION, ON A CITY STREET, ON A HIGHWAY, AND WHEN TURNING.    THERE IS NO DAMAGE OR EXCESSIVE WEAR AND TEAR TO THE PASSENGER SEAT.  THE PASSENGER SEAT WAS USED NORMALLY AND AS INTENDED BY THE MANUFACTURER.      I BELIEVE THE SEAT MAT WAS NOT DESIGNED TO WITHSTAND NORMAL USAGE OF PEOPLE SITTING ON IT.  OVER TIME THE SENSOR IN THE SEAT MAT FAILED AND POSES A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE FOR THE VEHICLE'S FRONT PASSENGER SINCE THE AIR BAG MAY NOT DEPLOY DURING A COLLISION.",
