I PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TURNED THE CAR OFF. I CHECKED TO SEE IF I COULD FIND ANYTHING WRONG. I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING SO I TURNED THE CAR BACK ON AND ALL THE LIGHTS WERE STILL ON BUT THE NOISE AND VIBRATING HAD STOPPED. I MADE IT HOME WITHOUT IT MAKING THE NOISE AGAIN. THE NEXT WEEKS WENT BY AND ALL THE LIGHTS ARE STILL ON AND IT MAKES THE NOISE AND VIBRATION EACH TIME I TURN THE CAR ON BUT AND I PRESSED THE BRAKES A FEW TIMES IT GOES AWAY EXPECT THE LIGHTS ARE ALWAYS ON NOW.",
