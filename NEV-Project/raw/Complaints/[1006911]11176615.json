THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT. I CAN BARELY SEE UNLESS MY HEADLIGHTS ARE ON. THIS PROBLEM HAS ALSO BEEN DANGEROUS IN THE RAIN AND I'VE ALMOST GOTTEN IN ACCIDENTS. NISSAN NEEDS TO RECALL THE HEADLIGHTS. I KNOW OTHER PEOPLE WITH AN ALTIMA BETWEEN 2013-2015 WHO HAVE GOTTEN IN ACCIDENTS BECAUSE OF THE VERY DIM HEADLIGHTS. MY HUSBAND HAS A JEEP AND HIS HEADLIGHTS ARE NOTICEABLY BETTER. NISSAN CANNOT DAY THEIR VEHICLE IS SAFE IF THIS IS HAPPENING. IT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE.",
