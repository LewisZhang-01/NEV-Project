        "summary": "WHILE IN MOTION, GOING STRAIGHT ON A HIGHWAY, MY CAR, 2021 HONDA PILOT TOURING, WITH APPROXIMATELY 1600 MILES ONLY, HAD THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE TIRE WALL SEPARATED WITHOUT ANY PHYSICAL AGITATION FROM THE DRIVER. THERE WAS SUDDEN LOSS OF PRESSURE, AND VEHICLE LOST CONTROL. VEHICLE WAS STOPPED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND PULLED OVER, BUT IN THAT SHORT WHILE THE ROLLING OF THE TIRE ON THE GROUND CAUSED BURNT SMELL TO SEEP INTO THE CAR FOR DRIVER TO NOTICE AND \"FREAK OUT\". THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO THE MOTOR WERKS HONDA, BARRINGTON, IL, WHERE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE. I WAS ASKED TO PAY FOR THE TIRE REPLACEMENT. THERE HAS BEEN NO OTHER DEFECT OR NOTEWORTHY CONDITION IDENTIFIED BY THE SERVICE TEAM.     THIS IS THE SAME CONDITION AS DESCRIBED IN NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER 20V725000; \"TIRE CARCASS MAY BREAK CAUSING SUDDEN AIR LOSS  OVER-CURED TIRES MAY DEVELOP A BREAK IN THE SIDEWALL RESULTING IN SUDDEN AIR LOSS OR A BELT EDGE SEPARATION WHICH COULD LEAD TO A TREAD/BELT LOSS. EITHER CONDITION CAN CAUSE A LOSS OF VEHICLE CONTROL, INCREASING THE RISK OF A CRASH OR INJURY.\"    REF: TIRE: CONTINENTAL, CROSSCONTACT LX SPORT 245/50R20 102 H    THE HONDA CORPORATE TEAM HAD PUBLISHED A BULLETIN AT END OF NOVEMBER 2020 RECALLING 214 HONDA PILOT, 2021, VEHICLES FOR THIS EXACT ISSUE, REQUIRING REPLACEMENT OF THE DEFECTIVE TIRES.    SINCE MY CAR'S VIN IS NOT IN THE RECALL LIST, NEITHER HONDA DEALERSHIP NOR THE CORPORATE  ARE ACCEPTING ANY RESPONSIBILITY. THERE WAS NO NAIL OR BLADE FOUND BY THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN. THE MILEAGE IS EXTREMELY LOW. HENCE, THE RESPONSIBILITY SHALL FALL ON HONDA TO ACCEPT AND REPLACE THE TIRE. I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET ANY HELP FROM HONDA IN THAT REGARD.     THE CAR STILL IS WITH THE DEALERSHIP'S SERVICE TEAM AS I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING THE CAR UNTIL ALL TIRES ARE REPLACED FOR FREE.    I WILL BE TALKING TO MY LEGAL TEAM FOR HELP AS MY INCONVENIENCE CONTINUES TO GROW.",
