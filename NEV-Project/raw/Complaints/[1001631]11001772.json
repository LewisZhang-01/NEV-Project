THE DEALER CLAIMED THIS IS A TRIM ISSUE.  IT IS NOT.  IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE.  WHAT IF THE CAR WAS INVOLVED IN A COLLISION AND WAS ON FIRE AND THE DOOR HANDLE DIDN'T WORK?  THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY ISSUE IN MY MIND.  I HAVE DONE RESEARCH ONLINE AND IT TURNS OUT THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING THIS SAME ISSUE.  NISSAN SHOULD RECALL THESE IMMEDIATELY.",
