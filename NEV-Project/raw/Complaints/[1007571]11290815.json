TWO EXPERIENCED VAN DRIVERS NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT AWAY. THE EXTRA SMALL TREAD TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF THE WIDE TIRES DOES LITTLE TO IMPROVE TRACTION FOR ACCELERATING FROM A PARKED POSITION. ALSO, SKIDDING IS MUCH MORE LIKELY WITH THESE TIRES. THE TIRES SHOULD HAVE MUCH DEEPER TREADS SINCE THEIR WIDTH GIVES LESS TRACTION.",
