THE LIGHT BULB WORKS BUT IT SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING TECHNICAL OR ELECTRICAL. THE CAR WAS IN MOTION WHEN THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE I WAS FOLLOWING MY MOTHER AND SHE PULLED OVER TO LET ME KNOW I WAS RUNNING ON JUST ONE HEADLIGHT AND A COP COULD PULL ME OVER FOR IT. I HAVE TO GET MY CAR INSPECTED AGAIN FOR LICENSE RENEWAL BUT WE HAVE TO FIX THIS FIRST!",
