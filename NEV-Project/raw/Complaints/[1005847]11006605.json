LUCKILY, I WAS NOT HURT OR HURT SOMEONE ELSE.  THE EDR DOWNLOAD CLEARLY SHOWED MY RPMS JUMPED FROM 400 TO 2,000 IN NANOSECONDS AND THAT THE ACCELERATOR WAS \"OFF.\"  TOYOTA'S RESPONSE TO ME WAS \"WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS INCIDENT WAS THE RESULT OF ANY TYPE OF DEFECT WITH THE ACCELERATOR OR BRAKES.\"  I AGREE IT IS NOT.  IT IS NOT A BRAKE PEDAL OR ACCELERATOR ISSUE.  IT IS A SOFTWARE ISSUE THAT CONTROLS THE FUEL TO THE VEHICLE.  AFTER TOYOTA WAS FINED $1.2 BILLION (LARGEST EVER FINE TO AN AUTO MAKER), THEY UPDATED THE SOFTWARE SO THERE IS A BRAKE OVERRIDE IN CASE THIS HAPPENS.  THE LOCAL LEXUS DEALERSHIP NEVER MENTIONED THIS TO ME NOR HAVE I EVER RECEIVED ANY TYPE OF RECALL NOTICE.  THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THE SOFTWARE IN MY VEHICLE HAD BEEN UPDATED.  TOYOTA IS \"VERY SORRY ABOUT THIS UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT.\"  PRETTY SAD WORDS FOR ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN KILLED IN ACCIDENTS BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.",
