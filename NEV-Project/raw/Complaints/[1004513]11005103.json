        "summary": "HAD JEEP RECALL PERFORMED FOR THE AUTO PARK ISSUE. SINCE THE RECALL, THE JEEP HAS TRIED TO ENGAGE AUTOPARK FOUR TIMES WHILE IN MOTION. THE FIRST TIME WE WERE 30 MILES FROM HOME, MERGING ON TO FREEWAY. JEEP WENT IN TO NEUTRAL, DISPLAY READ 'VEHICLE SPEED TOO FAST TO SHIFT I TO PARK'. OBVIOUSLY NOT TRYING TO SHIFT INTO PARK AS I MERGE IN HIGHWAY TRAFFIC! STOPPED IN SIDE OF ROAD, VEHICLE WOULD NOT SHIFT INTO PARK. SET EBRAKE, HAD VEHICLE TOWED IN. A FEW WEEKS LATER, TRANSFER CASE INTERNALLY EXPLODED. JUNE 19TH WIFE WAS GOING THROUGH AN INTERSECTION, VEHICLE WENT IN TO NEUTRAL AGAIN. THIS TIME DISPLAY SAYS ' AUTOPARK DISABLED. SHE COASTED IN TO A PARKING LOT, SHUT CAR OFF, STATED IT AND EVERYTHING WAS OK. FOUR DAYS AGO WIFE WAS BACKING OUT OF DRIVEWAY AND JEEP SLAMMED IN TO PARK, ON ITS OWN. SHE TRIED PULLING FORWARD AND IT SLAMMED INTO PARK AGAIN. AUTOPARK ONCE AGAIN TRIED TO ENGAGE ITSELF. THIS FEATURE SHOULD ONLY HAPPEN WHEN SPEEDS ARE 1.2 MPH OR SLOWER,  OR IF AT HIGHER SPEEDS, IT SHOULD SHIFT TRANSMISSION INTO NEUTRAL. I'M SCARED TO DRIVE THIS JEEP NOW. IF IT'S SLAMMING INTO PARK AT 10 MPH, WHAT'S TO PREVENT IT FROM DOING IT AT 65/70 MPH?",
