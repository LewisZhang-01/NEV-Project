        "summary": "AS I WAS DRIVING UP THE HIGHWAY AT AROUND 50 MPH, WITH MY THREE KIDS INSIDE, MY 2005 MALIBU LS JUST DECIDES TO START LOSING SPEED (I USED HAZARD LIGHTS) AND JUST GRADUALLY STOPS!!  A NEIGHBOR HELPED ME GET MY CAR DOWN THE HIGHWAY AND TO OUR APARTMENTS. I TRIED ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES LATER TO START MY CAR .IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE BATTERY OR THE FUEL PUMP BECAUSE ALL THE ELECTRICAL LIGHTS IN THE CAR STILL CAME ON AND THE GAS NEEDLE MOVED WHEN MY KEY WAS TURNED TO THE ON POSITION.  HOWEVER MY CAR DID NOT EVEN CRANK. IT STILL DOESN'T WANT TO START. I LIVE OUTSIDE OF CITY LIMITS AND I OWN MY CAR BUT THIS RANDOM INCIDENT CAN CAUSE ME TO LOSE MY JOB AND APARTMENT.  I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE LESS THAN A YEAR AGO AND HAD NO PRIOR PROBLEMS.  I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED ALONG WITH MY KIDS THIS IS VERY UNSAFE. THERE IS RECALL #11E009000 NOT SURE IF IT IS WHY THIS CAR ALMOST KILLED US BUT GM DEFINITELY OWES AN EXPLANATION FOR THESE FAULTY KILLER CARS ON THE ROAD.",
