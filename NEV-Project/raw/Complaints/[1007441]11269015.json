AFTER THE CAR STOPPED THE ENGINE IMMEDIATELY REVED UP TO OVER 3000 RPM. I IMMEDIATELY PUT THE CAR IN NEUTRAL AND TURNED OFF THE KEY. THE SECOND TIME THIS HAPPENED THE CONDITIONS WERE SIMILAR WITH THE ENGINE REVING UP TO APPROXIMATELY 5000 RPM.  IN BOTH CASES THE ENGINE REVED UP AFTER CAR WAS STOPPED AT THE END OF A LONG CONTINUOUS DRIVE. AT THE END OF THESE EVENTS I LOOKED DOWN AND VERIFIED THAT MY FOOT WAS DEFINITELY ON THE BRAKE. AFTER THE FIRST EVENT I HAD THE VEHICLE CHECKED BY A RELIABLE MECHANIC AND NOTHING UNUSUAL WAS FOUND.",
