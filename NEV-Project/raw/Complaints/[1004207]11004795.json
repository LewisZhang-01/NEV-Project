        "summary": "WAS ON A FREEWAY EXIT. TRAFFIC WAS HEAVY, AND I WAS IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC FOR ABOUT  10 MINUTES. I WAS JUST ROLLING FORWARD AND WHEN I APPLIED THE BRAKES THE PEDAL WENT DOWN TO NEAR BOTTOM AND IMMEDIATELY WARNING LIGHTS CAME ON INDICATING LOW BRAKE FLUID. I CLEARED THE SCREEN AND CONTINUED CAREFULLY TO MY SHOP WHICH WAS WITHIN A COUPLE OF MILES. I ADDED BRAKE FLUID TO THE MAX MARK THINKING I COULD NURSE IT TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIRS LATER IN THE DAY. WHEN I ATTEMPTED THAT TRIP SEVERAL HOURS LATER THE PEDAL WENT TO THE FLOOR AGAIN AND I HAD LITTLE OR NO BRAKE POWER. I DECIDED TO HAVE THE TRUCK TOWED AND PULLED BACK SLOWLY INTO THE PARKING SPACE. I HAD NO BRAKE AT THIS POINT AND ACTUALLY HAD TO JAM THE TRANSMISSION INTO PARK A COUPLE OF FEET BEFORE HITTING MY OWN BUILDING. THAT IS WHERE THE TOW TRUCK PICKED IT UP.",
