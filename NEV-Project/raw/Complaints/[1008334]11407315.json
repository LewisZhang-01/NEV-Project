        "summary": "2018 TOYOTA HIGHLANDER VEHICLE WAS SITTING IN PARKING LOT UNTOUCHED  ( WARM SUNNY DAY) .  VEHICLE WAS PARKED .    OWNER USED THE REMOTE HATCH OPENING BUTTON ON THE KEY REMOTE.  WHEN THE HATCH/ LIFT GATE STARTED OPENING A LOUD CRACKING / BUSTING SOUND WAS MADE.  THE SPOILER WAS SEPARATING ON THE SIDES  FROM THE HATCH AS WELL.    UPON INSPECTION, THE INSIDE PLASTIC HATCH COMPONENT HOLDING THE GLASS WINDOW WAS CRACKED IN 2 PLACES AND THE METAL PIECE INSIDE HATCH WAS BENT.   THERE WAS DAMAGE TO THE TOP OF THE VEHICLE WHERE THE HATCH / LIFT GATE IS SUPPOSE TO SEPARATE HOWEVER HATCH WAS RUBBING UP AGAINST THE TOP OF THE VEHICLE.     THE SAFETY RISK , THE SPOILER LOCATED ON THE BACK OF VEHICLE ATTACHED TO THE HATCH , BECAME DETACHED FROM ITS MOUNTED POSITION.  THIS CAUSED THE SPOILER TO SEPARATE AND OBSTRUCT THE HATCH LIFT GATE.  SPOILER LOCATED ON BACK IS CAUSING THE LIFT GATE TO NOT OPEN AND WHEN OWNER OPENS THE HATCH THE DETACHED SPOILER WILL CAUSE DAMAGE TO HATCH /LIFT GATE.",
