IT DID PASS THE NEW YORK STATE SAFETY INSPECTION IN 2020. HOWEVER, AFTER OWNING THE VEHICLE FOR A SHORT PERIOD I TOOK IT TO A MECHANIC FOR A OIL CHANGE. I WAS ADVISED THAT THE RUST/CORROSION ON THE FRAME AND UNDERBODY COMPONENTS WAS QUITE SEVERE. MY CONCERN IS THAT IT MAY WORSEN AND AFFECT THE OVERALL SAFETY OF THE TRUCK AS WELL AS THE RESALE VALUE. I'M AWARE THAT TOYOTA HAD A SIMILAR ISSUE WITH TACOMA'S, TUNDRA'S, AND SEQUOIA VEHICLES. WHY WASN'T THE 4RUNNER INCLUDED IN THESE RECALLS GIVEN THE LARGE AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS REGARDING 2003-2009 MODELS?",
