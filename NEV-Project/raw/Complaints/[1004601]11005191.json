I WAS ABLE TO DRIVE IT BACK HOME SAFELY. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALER WHO SAID I NEED TO REPLACE BRAKE MASTER CYLINDER WITH BRAKE BOOSTER. DOING RESEARCH I FOUND MANY OWNERS OF THE SAME MODEL CAR HAVE SAME PROBLEM AND SOME OF THE CARS ARE RECALLED BUT NOT ALL. I BELIEVE MOST OF 2010 TOYOTA PRIUS CAR HAVE ISSUES WITH BRAKE SYSTEM WHICH IS BAD FOR OUR SAFETY. IT CAN CAUSE SERIOUS HARM FOR OUR SAFETY. I REQUEST YOUR GOOD DEPARTMENT TO INVESTIGATE THE BRAKING ISSUES FOR 2010 TOYOTA PRIUS VEHICLE. AS A GOOD CITIZEN OF THE COUNTRY, I FELT I NEED TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE WITH YOU.",
