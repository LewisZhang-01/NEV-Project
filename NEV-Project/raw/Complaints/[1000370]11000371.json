THERE WAS A LOUD NOISE COMING FROM THE FRONT OF MY VEHICLE WHEN I TRIED TO BRAKE. I FINALLY GOT THE VEHICLE TO STOP IN A SAFE LOCATION, TURNED THE CAR OFF,RESTARTED THE VEHICLE, THE PROBLEM WENT AWAKE. THIS RECENTLY HAPPENED AGAIN ON THE CITY STREET. I PULLED OFF OF THE STREET, TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE THE PROBLEM WENT AWAY. I REALLY FEAR FOR MY LIFE BECAUSE I BARELY HAVE ANY BRAKES WHEN THIS HAPPENS. THE BRAKE PETAL IS PUSHED ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR BEFORE THE VEHICLE CAN STOP. THIS HAPPENS PERIODICALLY.",
