        "summary": "AT APPROXIMATELY 35,500 MILES I HAD THE TRACK BAR, A NEW STEERING BOX AND PITMAN ARM REPLACED BECAUSE OF WEAR, AT APPROXIMATELY 36,000 THE TRUCK DEVELOPED \"DEATH WOBBLE\" 3 TIMES OVER SMALL BUMPS AT ABOUT 50MPH . I TOOK IT IMMEDIATELY BACK TO FORD AND THEY REPLACED THE STEERING STABILIZER. I WAS DRIVING SOUTH ON I 81 IN THE FAST LANE THINKING THEY FIXED AND THE TRUCK AGAIN WENT INTO DEATH WOBBLE AT APPROXIMATELY 65 -70 MPH AND HAD TO BRAKE EXTREMELY HARD DOWN TO ABOUT 35 MPH TO GET IT TO STOP ALMOST CAUSING A MAJOR PILE UP AS THERE WAS HEAVY TRAFFIC AT THAT TIME. AFTER I GOT BACK I DROPPED THE TRUCK AT FORD AGAIN AND TOLD HIM DRIVE IT, WHICH HE WOULDN'T , HE SAID HE CHECKED ALL THE STEERING COMPONENTS AND THEY WERE TIGHT, HE SAID \"TAKE TO SOME PLACE THAT HAS A BETTER ALIGNMENT RACK, SO I DID THAT AND PAID OUT OF MY OWN POCKET FOR IT. IT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM, I REPLACED THE STEERING BOX TO A TOP OF THE LINE BOX OUT OF MY OWN POCKET EVEN THOUGH IT HAD BEEN REPLACED . I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DRIVE MY TRUCK SAFELY SINCE  NOV. OF 2018 AND IT IS NOW JUL. 29TH 2019. I CANT LET ANYONE ELSE DRIVE IT FOR FEAR OF KILLING AN INNOCENT PERSON, EVEN THE MECHANIC THAT PUT THE SECOND STEERING BOX IN DID THE ALIGNMENT AGAIN IS SCARED TO DRIVE IT BECAUSE IT HAPPENED WITH HIM AFTER THE 2ND REPLACEMENT BOX. AFTER LOOKING FOR THE PROBLEM AND SOLUTIONS I HAVE FOUND THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE. IF THIS IS NOT TAKEN CARE OF PEOPLE ARE GOING DIE, IF THEY HAVE NOT ALREADY. IT IS VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THERE ARE NOT DEATHS AND VERY SERIOUS INJURIES CAUSED BY THIS AS I HAVE BEEN THROWN INTO THE OTHER LANE SEVERAL TIMES AND DROP A HUGE AMOUNT OF SPEED VERY QUICKLY . I PAID $60,000 DOLLARS FOR A BRAND NEW TRUCK AND NOW NO ONE CAN SAFELY DRIVE IT, EVEN THE MECHANIC'S ARE SCARED TO DRIVE IT. I HAVE HAD DEATH WOBBLE AT LEAST 13 TO 15 TIMES FROM JANUARY UNTIL NOW AND AT SPEEDS FROM 45 TO 70. PLEASE HELP !!",
