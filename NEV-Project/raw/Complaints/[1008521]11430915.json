After driving about 50 miles or so, the gauge will move up some ; however, I have been relying on my DTE monitor to let me know about gas. I have taken it to the dealer twice and both said \u201cthe gas tank needs to be dropped in order for repair\u201d I was About to pay for the service but was told I had to make an appointment. However the service advise ask had I had it replaced before because there was a recall on that particular part several years ago. Please note I have never received any notice about a recall regarding the issue.  Please advise.",
