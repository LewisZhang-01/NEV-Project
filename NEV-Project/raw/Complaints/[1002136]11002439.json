THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT HAD NOT TURNED ON INDICATING A PROBLEM. THE DEALERSHIP RECALIBRATED THE TRANSMISSION LAST WEEK AND THE CAR WAS RETURNED TO THE SHOP WITHIN 24 HOURS WITH THE SAME ISSUE MAGNIFIED. THE DEALERSHIP NOW SAYS THEY CANNOT DUPLICATE THE ISSUE. WHEN THE ISSUE FIRST PRESENTED I WAS IN MOTION ON A BUSY CITY STREET. PREVIOUSLY THE CAR HAD A FAULTY RANGE SWITCH THAT WAS INTERMITTENT AND TOOK 6 MONTHS TO DUPLICATE FOR THE DEALERSHIP. THEIR INITIAL FIX WAS TO ADJUST THE SWITCH, A YEAR LATER THE ISSUE RETURNED AND THEY REPLACED THE SWITCH AT THAT TIME. WONDERING IF THE TWO ISSUES ARE RELATED.",
