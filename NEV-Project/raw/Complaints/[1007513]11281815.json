        "summary": "MY CAR AT APPROX 58000 MILES HAD A KNOCKING SOUND IN THE ENGINE. LAND ROVER CENTERVILLE DIAGNOSED IT AS NEEDING A NEW TENSIONER, TIMING CHAIN AND SUPERCHARGER ISOLATOR. THE REPAIR WAS $6200. 2 YEARS LATER AT 84000 MILES THE VEHICLE IDLED ROUGHLY AND THREW A CODE\"PERFORMANCE RESTRICTED\" ALONG WITH THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT. I DROVE IT SLOWLY TO THE NEAREST AUTO REPAIR SHOP (5 BLOCKS) WHERE IT DUPLICATED THE ROUGH IDLING AND CODE AND THEN THE ENGINE PROCEEDED TO BLOW UP DUE TO A FAULTY TENSIONER THAT CAUSED THE TIMING CHAIN TO SLACKEN AND DESTROY PISTONS AND VALVES. THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT COULD HAVE CAUSED A CATASTROPHE HAD IT OCCURRED ON THE HIGHWAY. I ORIGINALLY REPLACED THE FAULTY TENSIONERS UNDER THE GUISE THIS WOULD PREVENT AN OCCURRENCE SUCH AS THIS. LAND ROVER STATES THE TIMING CHAIN SHOULD LAST THE LIFE TIME OF THE VEHICLE AND I AM NOW ON MY THIRD ONE WITH A 2012 VEHICLE THAT HAS ONLY 84000 MILES. THE WORSE PART IS THAT THIS FAULTY DESIGN CAUSED MY ENGINE TO SEIZE. I AM NOW OUT 2 VERY COSTLY REPAIR BILLS AND I HAVE NO GUARANTEE THE NEW TENSIONER AND TIMING CHAIN WILL FUNCTION PROPERLY.   I HAVE INVESTIGATED THE PROBLEM AND APPARENTLY THIS IS A SITUATION LANDROVER IS WELL AWARE OF, YET THERE IS NO RECALL. THERE NEEDS TO BE.THE ONLY SOLUTION IS TO REPLACE THE ENGINE, REBUILD IT OR PART THE CAR OUT AS IT IS USELESS ONCE THIS OCCURS.",
