I WAS TOLD I JUST NEEDED A NEW BATTERY (WHICH WAS REPLACED TWICE WITHIN THE SAME WEEK). THIS PROCESS BEGAN ON 11/12/2016. I RECEIVED THE SAME ERROR ON MY DASH (BATTERY CHARGING SYSTEM NEEDS SERVICING) AND MY BATTERY HAD TO BE JUMPED JUST LIKE BEFORE ON 4/12/2017. I CONTACTED ONSTAR AND MADE AN APPT.WITH THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT MCCARTHY MORSE CHEVROLET FOR THE NEXT MORNING (4/13/2017). HOWEVER I DIDN'T MAKE IT BECAUSE MY CAR WENT UP IN FLAMES IN MY GARAGE ABOUT 15MINS. AFTER ME AND MY CHILDREN GOT OUT OF IT!!!! OTHER ISSUES THAT WERE ADDRESSED DURING THIS 6MO. TIME FRAME INCLUDED: A/C REPLACEMENT, HEAD GASKETS AND HEAD BOLTS REPLACEMENT, TIMING CHAIN AND CAM SHAFT ACTUATORS REPLACEMENT, AND FLYWHEEL REPLACEMENT. I FEEL LIKE THE SERVICES DEPARTMENT HAD PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THESE ISSUES AND DIDN'T CORRECT THEM BEFORE EITHER.",
