THE TRANSMISSION WAS CRACKED-CHEVROLET SAID NOT THEIR FAULT, SO, I REPLACED THE TRANSMISSION. THEN, IT STARTED DOING IT AGAIN. I REPLACED THE BRAKE PADS. IT STOPPED. THEN, STARTED UP AGAIN. TOOK TO THE CHEVROLET GARAGE WHO PUT IT ON THEIR TOTAL DIAGNOSTIC MACHINE. TOLD I NEED BOTH BEARINGS ON THE FRONT. AT A $972.00 PRICE TAG FOR THIS, I BOUGHT THE BEARINGS AND HAD ANOTHER GARAGE PUT THEM ON AT A GREAT REDUCTION IN COST TO ME ON LABOR. NOW, IT IS DOING IT AGAIN. AT FIRST IT WAS ONLY EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE. THE WHEEL SENSORS APPEAR TO BE FINE. NOW I NOTICE IT IS DOING IT A LOT MORE AND STARTING TO DO IT WHEN I ACCELERATE FROM A STOP AT CERTAIN TIMES. I BOUGHT THIS CAR BRAND NEW, AND, FOR ITS AGE, IT DOES NOT EVEN HAVE 60,000 MILES ON IT. (THE DATE THAT THAT I AM USING IN THE NEXT STEP HERE  IT BEGAN IS THE DATE WHEN IT REALLY STARTED DOING ITS 'TRICKS' A LOT MORE).",
