        "summary": "OH BOY...HERE GOES. I HAVE A 2008 SATURN OUTLOOK FWD.  FOR THE SECOND TIME IN A SPAN IF A FEW YEARS, WATER HAS LEAKED FROM THE SUNROOF AND INTO THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS, FUSEBOXES, FLOORS, ETC.  THIS IS THE INFAMOUS DRAINHOSE CLOGGING ISSUE THAT MANY MAY KNOW ABOUT.    THE CAR NOW ONLY STARTS WHEN THE KEY IS REMOVED FROM THE IGNITION.  THE STEERING WHEEL IS LOCKED BUT I CAN SHIFT GEARS AND MOVE THE CAR BACKWARD AND FORWARD.  I'VE CLEANED UP THE WATER, GRIME AND LITTLE LARVAE GROWING FROM THE WATER INTRUSION.  ALL ELECTRONICS WORK CORRECTLY (EVEN THE BUTT WARMER &#128522;)    WHAT I'VE TRIED SO FAR:  -REPLACED THE IGNITION SWITCH.  -REPLACED THE BATTERY  -CHECKED ALL OF THE FUSES OF THE UNDERHOOD FUSEBOXES  -CHECKED SEVERAL FUSES OF THE UNDER DASH FUSEBOX  -THREW A TEMPER TANTRUM  -CUT MY FINGER TRYING TO GET TO IMPOSSIBLY PLACED SCREWS  -CHECKED FOR RECALLS.  GM STILL DOES NOT SUPPORT   AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS ISSUE  -PULLED THE CODES.  THE RECENT ONES I'VE GOTTEN ARE: C0899, C0561, P0017, P0011    LAST TIME THIS HAPPENED, IT COST ME OVER $1500 TO REPLACE ALL OF THE FUSES/WIRING.    I AM FRUSTRATED, YES.  NO, I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO FIX THIS YET AGAIN.  BUT I AM MORE AMAZED AT HOW GM LEAVES THIS ISSUE WITH A TSB AND A GRAIN OF SALT, IN SPITE OF THE OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE OF THIS LONG OCCURRING PROBLEM.      I AM LOOKING FOR ADVICE.  MECHANICAL ADVICE.  LEGAL ADVICE.  MEDITATION TIPS.  I'LL TAKE ANYTHING.     \"SALLY\", AS THE FAMILY CALLS HER, IS HOW WE GET TO WORK, DRIVE THE KIDS TO SCHOOL, CHURCH, PLAYDATES, VISIT FAMILY, AND OTHER THINGS THAT FAMILIES HAVE TO DO AND LIKE TO DO.    I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM GM, TOO, BUT I'M NOT GOING TO HOLD MY BREATH.     INSTEAD, YOU'LL FIND ME SOMEWHERE INSIDE, BENEATH, OR ON TOP OF SALLY.  I'LL BE THE ONE COVERED IN GREASE, CONSTANTLY SIGHING AND WONDERING ABOUT ALL THE OTHERS WHO HAVE THIS SAME ISSUE.",
