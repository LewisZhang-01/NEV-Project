HOWEVER, EVERY DAY, A LOUD POPPING CREAKING SOUND THAT YOU CAN EVEN FEEL IS COMING FROM THE ELECTRIC POWER-ASSIST STEERING. ESPECIALLY NOTICEABLE WHEN PULLING IN OR OUT OF A PARKING LOT/DRIVEWAY/GARAGE. LOCAL SHOP SAYS IT WILL COST ABOUT $2500 TO REPLACE THE ELECTRIC POWER-ASSIST STEERING RACK AND PINION, AND IT MUST THEN BE PROGRAMMED TO THE VEHICLE. THIS EXPLORER HAS 78,000 MILES ON IT. THANKS.",
