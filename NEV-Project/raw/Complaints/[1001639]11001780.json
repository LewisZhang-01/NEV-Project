        "summary": "FROM THE VOLKSWAGEN RECALL SITE RE: STEERING WHEEL AIR BAG & CLOCK SPRING.    SUMMARY:  VOLKSWAGEN GROUP OF AMERICA, INC. (VOLKSWAGEN) IS RECALLING CERTAIN MODEL YEAR 2010-2014 VOLKSWAGEN CC VEHICLES. IN THE AFFECTED VEHICLES, DEBRIS MAY CONTAMINATE THE AIR BAG CLOCK SPRING, A SPIRAL WOUND, FLAT CABLE THAT KEEPS THE AIR BAG POWERED WHILE THE STEERING WHEEL IS BEING TURNED. THIS CONTAMINATION MAY TEAR THE CABLE AND RESULT IN A LOSS OF ELECTRICAL CONNECTION TO THE DRIVER'S FRONTAL AIR BAG.    CONSEQUENCE:  A LOSS OF ELECTRICAL CONNECTION TO THE DRIVER'S FRONTAL AIR BAG WILL PREVENT THE AIR BAG FROM DEPLOYING IN THE EVENT OF A VEHICLE CRASH, INCREASING THE RISK OF INJURY.    THE LOCAL VW DEALER SAYS OUR CAR IS NOT INCLUDED HOWEVER, NOTHING WORKS ON THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT IN THE DASH IS ON.  WHEN CONTACTING VW DIRECT I AM TOLD NHTSA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPANDING THE RECALL TO INCLUDE OUR VIN.    QUESTIONS?   IS OUR CAR SAFE TO DRIVE?  IF WE HAVE A FRONT END COLLISION WILL THE STEERING WHEEL AIR BAG WORK?  IF NHTSA IS AWARE OF 420,000 RECALLS FOR THIS SAME ISSUE WILL THE RECALL BE EXPANDED TO COVER OTHER VIN?  THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE FIX AND ALL LOGIC TELLS ME IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL RECALL.",
