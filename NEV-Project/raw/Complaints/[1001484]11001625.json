I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION THAT THE PARTS ARE AVAILABLE DESPITE CONTACTING THE DEALER REPEATEDLY.  BMW HAS BEEN PROMISING THE PARTS FOR OVER ONE YEAR NOW. I BELIEVE THEY ARE STALLING TO REDUCE THEIR COST DUE TO CARS FALLING OUT OF SERVICE FROM WRECKS ETC.  THE DEALER ALSO REFUSES TO DISABLE THE AIRBAGS LEAVING BMW OWNERS NO CHOICE BUT TO DRIVE INHERENTLY DANGEROUS CARS.   YET THEY CAN FIND ENOUGH AIRBAGS TO MANUFACTURE NEW VEHICLES.   I KNOW THIS IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM BUT IF THE NHSTA CAN EXERT A LITTLE PRESSURE FOR THESE AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURERS TO EMPHASIZE REPAIRING THEIR POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS CARS THE PUBLIC WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT.",
