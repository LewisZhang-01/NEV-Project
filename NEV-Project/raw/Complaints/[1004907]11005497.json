NOW THE DRIVERS DOOR LOCK HAS FAILED AGAIN. THE DRIVERS DOOR WILL NOT LOCK OR UNLOCK WHEN USING THE FOB. THE REAR DRIVERS SIDE DOOR WILL NOT LOCK OR UNLOCK USING THE FOB OR ANY OTHER LOCK / UNLOCK SWITCH IN THE CAR. THIS MEANS THE CAR CANNOT BE OPENED USING THE FOB AT ALL. IT'S A SAFETY HAZARD AND TOYOTA WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY TO REPLACE THEM.",
