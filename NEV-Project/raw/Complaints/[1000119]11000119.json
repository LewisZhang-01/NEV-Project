THERE'S A HARD SPOT AT CENTER THAT CAUSES YOU TO BE EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT OF IT CAUSING CONSTANT STRUGGLE TO KEEP IT IN YOUR LANE. HAVE BEEN TO SEVERAL DEALERSHIPS ONLY TO BE TOLD THERE'S NO RECALL OR TSB'S ON THIS VEHICLE REGARDING THIS ISSUE. RESEARCHING THE WEB I'VE DISCOVERED DOZENS OF HYUNDAI OWNERS EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM. IF NOT BEING ABLE TO KEEP THE VEHICLE CENTERED IN YOUR LANE ISN'T A SAFETY ISSUE I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS! ONE SERVICE WRITER IN FT. COLLINS COLORADO ACTUALLY ADMITTED THERE WAS A PROBLEM BUT DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT FIXING IT. THE SAME ISSUE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED ON 2012 SONATAS BUT APPARENTLY NOTHING WAS DONE AT THE FACTORY TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM IN 2013",
