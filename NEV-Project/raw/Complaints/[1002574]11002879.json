        "summary": "WE PURCHASED VAN NEW FROM DODGE DEALER IN SEPTEMBER OF 2006.  ABOUT 5 MONTHS AGO MY WIFE (NORMALLY DRIVES) STALLED PULLING TOWARD AN INTERSECTION SHORTLY AFTER SHE DROVE FROM FILLING THE GAS TANK.  THE VAN RUNS FINE OTHERWISE AND NOW HAS ABOUT 112K MILES. THIS HAPPENED TO HER A FEW MORE TIMES (VERY STRESSFUL LOSING POWER STEERING AND BRAKES). THEREFORE, ONE FILL-UP TO CHECK IT I DROVE THE CAR AND IT DID THE SAME A COUPLE MINUTES AFTER FILL-UP DRIVING 1/4 MILE SLOWLY IN NEARBY HOME DEPOT PARKING LOT (AFRAID I WOULD HIT SOMEONE TRYING TO TURN (SIMILAR CONDITIONS AS MY WIFE HAD). THE VAN WILL RESTART AFTER TRYING A COUPLE OF TIMES AND THEN RUN FINE FOR THE REST OF THE TANK.      WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO STOP FILLING THE TANK ABOVE 3/4, AN INCONVENIENCE TO PLAN FOR BUT SEEMS TO ELIMINATE THAT PROBLEM; BUT I AM NOT SURE HOW MUCH LONGER THAT WILL WORK. IN DOING RESEARCH I UNDERSTAND OTHER DODGE VAN OWNERS IN THAT YEAR RANGE HAVE HAD THIS PROBLEM. APPARENTLY, DUE TO THE DESIGN OF THE VALVE THAT IS FAILING THE ENTIRE GAS TANK MUST ALSO BE REPLACED WHICH IS VERY COSTLY.    I FEEL THAT CHRYSLER USED A VERY POOR DESIGN OR PART WHERE IF ONLY THE VALVE FAILS THAT THE ENTIRE GAS TANK MUST BE REPLACED.  THE VAN RUNS FINE, WE LIKE THE VAN AND WERE PLANNING TO DRIVE IT MANY MORE MILES BUT AT THIS POINT THE COSTLY REPAIR INVOLVED IS A GOOD PORTION OF THE VEHICLE VALUE.  I THINK THAT CHRYSLER SHOULD HELP US IN REPAIRING THIS ISSUE.  IT IS OBVIOUSLY A SAFETY ISSUE WHEN DRIVING THE CAR, AND A DESIGN FLAW IN MY OPINION IN THAT FAILURE OF A SMALL COMPONENT REQUIRES THE WHOLE GAS TANK SYSTEM TO BE REPLACED.    PLEASE LET US KNOW CHRYSLER'S POSITION ON THIS ISSUE.  WE REALIZE THAT THE VEHICLE IS OUT OF CHRYSLER'S WARRANTY BUT FEEL THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECTIFIED WHEN THE ISSUE BECAME KNOWN A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO.    THANKS IN ADVANCE",
