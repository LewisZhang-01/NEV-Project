WHEN IT DOES THIS IT STUMBLES REALLY BADLY. YOU HAVE TO PUT IT BACK TO DRIVE TO DRIVE NORMAL. IT CAN HAPPEN ABOUT 3 TIMES A DAY. RIGHT AFTER IT HAPPENS THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON FOR ABOUT 3 DAYS. I HAVE SEARCHED ONLINE AND AT LEAST 50 OTHER PEOPLE WITH A 2006/2007 JEEP COMMANDER HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. SOME PEOPLE SAY IT HAPPENS TO THEM (ALL GEARS LIGHT UP) WHILE THEY ARE DRIVING. THIS CAUSES THEIR VEHICLE TO NOT ACCELERATE OR \"JERK\" BACK AND FORTH. THEY HAVE TO PULL OVER AND START THE CAR AGAIN AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHTS UP. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF I WARM IT UP FOR OVER 10 MINUTES IT WILL STILL DO IT WHEN I PUT IT ON REVERSE OR DRIVE. I AM WORRIED IT WILL GET WORSE AND HAPPEN LIKE THE OTHER PEOPLE ONLINE WHEN I'M DRIVING OR ON THE FREEWAY. ONLINE MANY PEOPLE WRITE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM WITH THEIR 2006/2007 JEEP COMMANDER. MANY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.",
