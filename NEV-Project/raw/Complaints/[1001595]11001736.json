IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WAS A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST NISSAN'S 2008 & 2009 ALTIMAS THAT HAVE THE SAME ISSUE. WHEN I CONTACTED NISSAN USA (CASE # 2716855) THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD OFFER TO PAY FOR HALF OF THE REPAIR WHICH WOULD STILL BE $1000 OUT OF POCKET. MY QUESTION IS; ARE THEY WAITING FOR A FATAL ACCIDENT TO HAPPEN BEFORE THEY OFFER A CAMPAIGN FOR RECALL? YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER WOULD BE APPRECIATED.",
