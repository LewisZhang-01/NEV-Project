DAY 3: COULD NOT GET VEHICLE OUT OF THE GARAGE AS THE STEERING WAS EXTREMELY HARD, HARDER TO LEFT THAN RIGHT. NO FLUID FOUND ON GARAGE FLOOR. HAD VEHICLE TOWED TO DEALERSHIP TO DIAGNOSE. I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE POWER STEERING RACK BUT WAS NOT TOLD EXACTLY HOW IT WAS FAILING BUT HE DID MENTION HE SEES THIS 'A LOT'. CAR WAS PURCHASED AND DRIVEN IN MARYLAND/DC/N. VA (UNSURE IF CAR WAS PROPERLY TREATED AGAINST THE SUBSTANCE TO MELT ICE). I'M GLAD THIS DID NOT HAPPEN WHILE DRIVING WITH MY CHILD BUT IF INDEED A FAULTY MECHANISM, WHY ISN'T ACURA RECALLING?",
