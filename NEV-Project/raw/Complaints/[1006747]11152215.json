CHECKED WIRING CONNECTIONS, REPLACED TURN SIGNAL BULBS, NOTHING WOULD STOP THE FLICKERING. FINALLY THE PASSENGER SIDE TAIL LIGHT FAILED COMPLETELY. THEN ABOUT 2 WEEKS LATER THE DRIVER SIDE TAIL LIGHT FAILED. THESE ARE LEDS.  TOOK IT TO A HYUNDAI DEALER. THE CHECKED OUT THE LIGHTS. VERIFIED POWER WAS COMING TO THE LIGHTS, BUT THEY WOULD STILL NOT ILLUMINATE. APPLIED EXTERNAL POWER TO THE LIGHTS, STILL NO ILLUMINATION. RECOMMENDATION FROM THE DEALER WAS TO COMPLETELY REPLACE THE UNITS. SUSPECT BRAKE LIGHTS CAN FAIL NEXT WITHOUT WARNING TO THE DRIVER.",
