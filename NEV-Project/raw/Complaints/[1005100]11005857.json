        "summary": "I PURCHASED LT265/75/16 BF GOODRICH RUGGED TERRAIN T/A TIRES FOR MY TRUCK EXACTLY 5 YEARS AND JUST OVER 21K MILES LATER I HAD 2 SEPARATE TIRE FAILURES LESS THAN A FEW HUNDRED MILES APART. FIRST TIRE A BELT SLIPPED. HAD A GIANT BULGE IN THE TREAD. I PUT MY SPARE ON AND INSPECTED THE OTHER TIRES. ALL OK. NO CRACKS NO DRY ROT. I HAVE PICS. TIRE PRESSURE SET EQUALLY AT 78 PSI. I WAS AWAY CAMPING AND PULLING A 9000 LB TRAILER. LOCAL TIRE STORE DIDN'T HAVE A REPLACEMENT SO I HEADED HOME FIGURED I WOULD REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER MATCHING TIRE AT HOME. ABOUT 100 MILES LATER WE HAD A SECOND TIRE FAIL. THIS ONE BLEW OUT AT HIGHWAY SPEED, CAUSING A LOT OF DAMAGE TO THE TRUCK AND LEFT ME STRANDED WITH NO SPARE. AFTER DOING SO RESEARCH AND READING BFG RECALLS FOR TIRES SIMILAR TO THIS ONE BUT DIFFERENT SIZES, I AM LEFT TO WONDER IF ALL OF THESE SIZES SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE RECALL. THE RECALL TIRES FAILED IN THE SAME MANNER AS MINE THAT WAS NOT INCLUDED ONLY BECAUSE OF THE SIZE AND I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED. I HAD MY WIFE AND 3 KIDS IN THE TRUCK AND IT WAS A DANGEROUS SITUATION. THE TIRE BLEW OUT ON THE PA TURNPIKE. 65 MPH WHILE TOWING A HEAVY TRAILER. SUNNY. 85* DAY. THE BULGED TIRE HAPPENED A LOW SPEED. 25 MPH ON BACK ROADS. ALL OF THESE TIRES SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE RECALL IT IS DANGEROUS TO HAVE THEM ON THE ROAD.",
