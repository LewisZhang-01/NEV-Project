        "summary": "The exhaust manifold failed and yes, it is available for inspection.  My daughter's safety was put at risk after I was advised by Kia service center that I needed to replace the rocker cover and a fuel pump. My daughter experienced the burning smell of fuel and the vehicle would not accelerate and would not go above the speed limit of 20, when on an incline. I took my vehicle to Kia service center on July 14, 2021 following the instructions written on the NHTSA Recall # 20V750 notice I received from Kia and they advised me that I needed to replace the rocker cover and a fuel pump.  I paid $405 for replacement parts and service, left the service center with the impression that the vehicle was repaired. My daughter drove the vehicle back and forth to work and everything was okay until July 22, 2021 one week and a day after the repair, the MIL illuminated. I took the vehicle back to the service center and I was then advised that I needed to replace the exhaust manifold and all four coils. I was also advised that the exhaust manifold is on national back order with no expected date. I was told to call Kia corporate and Kia corporate office has advised me that there is nothing they can do to assist me. The associate at the Kia service center said I could drive the vehicle but after a while it would cause other damage to the engine. I questioned the service center manager about why would they tell me that the repair they made on the 14th fixed the issue. He informed me that they had no way of knowing what the issue was until the MIL light came on. I informed him that it is an issue that there was no warning lamp to advise of the first two parts I paid for that they said was the issue. Kia would not afford towing to service center.  Kia service center has confirmed that the problem with the vehicle now is the exhaust manifold.  The vehicle/component have been inspected by Kia service center.  First visit to Kia no warning lamps/messages, there was the burning smell of fuel.",
