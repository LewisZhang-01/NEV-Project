THERE WAS A RECALL FOR DASHBOARD CRACKS, BUT IT WAS TIME BOUND.   IF CONSUMER IS ALWAYS PARKING CAR INDOORS, SYMPTOMS WILL TAKE TIME TO APPEAR. AS THIS PROBLEM AFFECTS SAFETY OF AIRBAG AND OTHER CRITICAL COMPONENTS AROUND DASHBOARD, IT SHOULD BE REPAIRED IRRESPECTIVE OF WHEN THE SYMPTOM START HAPPENING.  MANY OTHER CONSUMERS ARE ALSO SEEING SIMILAR ISSUES. LEXUS FORUMS ARE FLOODED WITH COMPLAINTS ABOUT DASHBOARD. SOMEONE FROM NHTSA SHOULD INVESTIGATE THIS IN DETAIL.",
