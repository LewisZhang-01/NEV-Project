I'M STILL HAVING THE SAME EXACT ISSUES I'VE HAD BEFORE JUST A MONTH AFTER PURCHASING THIS 2016 (BRAND NEW) CAR LAST YEAR! THE ACCELERATION STILL STAGGERS AND I CAN'T MOVE FROM A STOP, SLOW DOWN, OR WHEN I'M ALREADY IN MOTION ON THE HIGHWAY, ON CITY STREETS, COUNTY ROADS, AND THE INTERSTATE - NOT MY IDEA OF A SAFE CAR WHEN THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT IT IN THE FIRST PLACE! IT STALLS AND THE RPMS AND EVERYTHING ON THE ODOMETER DROPS TO ALMOST ZERO. TAKE BACK THIS AWFULLY MADE VEHICLE! IT'S EXTREMELY UNSAFE AND \"UPDATES\" AREN'T PERMANENTLY FIXING THE ISSUES. STOP GIVING IT A BAND-AID \"FIX\" AND JUST TAKE THIS CAR BACK. LEMON LAW. LEMON LAW. LEMON LAW. I DON'T WANT IT. WHEN THERE'S ON-COMING TRAFFIC AND I CAN'T MOVE, HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO STOP SOMEONE FROM HITTING ME WITH MY BABY IN THE BACKSEAT!?!?!? I CAN'T. BECAUSE I CAN'T MAKE THIS CAR MOVE.",
