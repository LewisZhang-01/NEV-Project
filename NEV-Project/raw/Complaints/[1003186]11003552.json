I WAS TOLD SEVERAL TIMES THEY HAD TO ORDER THE PARTS. I ALSO EXPLAINED TO THEM THERE IS AN \"ADD A LEAF\" ON MY TRUCK. THE TRUCK IS LIFTED 3\". I SAID I'M NOT PAYING FOR ANYTHING HERE THIS IS A FULL RECALL UNDER TOYOTA. WE SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT FOR JULY 7TH AT 7:30AM. I GET THERE AND THEY REFUSE TO DO THE WORK WITHOUT ME PAYING DUE TO THE \"ADD A LEAF\". THEY HAVE WASTED 9 MONTHS WITH THIS AS MYSELF, MY WIFE AND 3 YOUNG CHILDREN RIDE IN THIS TRUCK EVERYDAY! I'M EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH HOW CAIN TOYOTA HAS HANDLED THIS ISSUE. WE ARE NOW AT RISK DUE TO CAINS REFUSAL TO REPAIR THIS AT TOYOTA'S RECALL EXPENSES. I WILL ALSO BE CALLING TOYOTA CORPORATE TO PLACE A FORMAL COMPLAINT AS WELL.",
