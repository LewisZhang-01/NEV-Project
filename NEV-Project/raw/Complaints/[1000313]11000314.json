I WAS CLEANING OUT OUT OUR VEHICLE WHILE STATIONARY IN OUR DRIVEWAY WITH THE BACK DOOR OPEN, AND NEXT THING I KNEW HE DOOR HAD SLAMMED DOWN ON ME. ONE OF THE LIFT GATE SUPPORTS GATEWAY AND BLEW AND COLLAPSED ON TOP OF ME. I SUFFERED FROM A MAJOR HEADACHE AND SOME MINOR BACK PAIN. I'M GRATEFUL THIS WAS NOT MY CHILD WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN HURT WORSE. THIS SEEMS TO BE A SAFETY ISSUE.. I CONTACTED DEALERSHIP AND NO RECALL LISTED NOR COVERED WE HAD TO REPLACE AND REPAIR OURSELVES. WE PURCHURSED NEW ONES AND REPLACED TODAY WHEN WE RECEIVED THEM!",
