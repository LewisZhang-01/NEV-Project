VW DEALERSHIP SERVICE TECHNICIANS DIAGNOSED THE ISSUE AS A TURBO WASTE GATE NOISE (\"NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT AT THIS TIME\"). TWO DAYS LATER THE ENGINE STARTS TO ACT LIKE IT'S MISFIRING ALMOST BUCKING THEN WITHIN MINUTES THE ENGINE GOES(WON'T START, TRYING TO START ENGINE JUST 'SPINS'). TOWED BACK TO SERVICE. INTERNAL INSPECTION FROM THEIR TECHNICIANS CONFIRMED BENT PARTS, ETC - $8,000 TO REPLACE ENGINE. MY RESEARCH INDICATES THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE 2.0T TSI TIMING CHAIN TENSIONER FAILURE AS LISTED IN NHTSA SERVICE BULLETIN #TB-15-12-01 NHTSA ITEM NUMBER 10045560. CERTAINLY THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT WAS THE ACTUAL PROBLEM. ACCORDING TO THE TSB IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE ACROSS MANY VW MODELS/YEARS. WHY OWNERS ARE NOT NOTIFIED OF THIS POTENTIAL ISSUE AND GIVEN A CHANCE TO TAKE ACTION TO FIX IT BEFORE SOMETHING CATASTROPHIC HAPPENS IS DISHEARTENING.",
