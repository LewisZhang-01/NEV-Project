AFTER DRIVE FOR AWHILE THE OVERDIVE LIGHT STARTS TO BLINK. IF I TURN OFF THE ENGINE THE LIGHT STOPS BLINKING. THE CAR PERFORMS MUCH BETTER WITH THE OVERDIVE OFF. HAD THE TRANSMISSION REBUILT AND IT DIDN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM. THE TRANSMISSION SHOP SAYS THE PROBLEM IS NOT IN THE TRANSMISSUON ITSELF. FORD DEALER RECOMMENDED CHANGING THE TROTTLE SENSON, $100 LATER THAT DIDN'T WORK. MECHANICS IN TOWN CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT. IT SOUNDS LIKE 2 GEARS TRYING TO ENGAGE, THUS THE GRINDING NOISE. WHEN I DRIVE WITH THE OVERDRIVE OFF IT HAPPENS AT A HIGHER SPEED. ALWAYS HAPPENS WHEN DRIVI G UP A LONG INCLINE. GOING CRAZY WITH THIS PROBLEM.",
