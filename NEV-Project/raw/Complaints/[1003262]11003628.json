IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE ELANTRA CAN BE TURNED OFF WHILE NOT IN PARK WITHOUT ANY KIND OF WARNING/BUZZER GOING OFF TO REMIND THE DRIVER THAT A VERY HAZARDOUS SITUATION IS IN PLAY.    MOST DRIVERS GRAB THE KEY WHEN LEAVING THE CAR AND CANNOT PHYSICALLY REMOVE THE KEY WHEN THE CAR OUT OF \"PARK\".  THIS PREVENTS THE CAR FROM ROLLING DOWN A HILL AS THE DRIVER WALKS AWAY.  THE KEY-LESS IGNITION HAS BYPASSED THIS SAFETY FEATURE.    THIS SITUATION WILL LIKELY BE ADDRESS BY CLASS ACTION SOONER THAN LATER. IT WOULD BE VERY THOUGHTFUL IF SOMEONE COULD PREVENT THE HUMAN COST THAT IS LIKELY TO ENSUE.",
