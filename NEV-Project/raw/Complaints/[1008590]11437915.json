        "summary": "Today while driving on the highway at 75 miles per hour, the front end of my vehicle suddenly started violently shaking. It felt like a blow out had occurred on both front tires. The entire front of the vehicle shook like an earthquake, and the steering wheel shook so hard that I had difficulty holding onto it to control the vehicle as I slowed to a stop.  It was difficult to hold it straight, as not to allow it into the other lane.  There were no warning lights or notifications on the dash.   I got out and walked around to inspect the vehicle, and there was nothing apparently wrong.  I continued driving, and within a 400 mile trip, this same event occurred 3 times.  The truck is well aligned, as I can generally remove my hands from the steering wheel and it remains moving straight forward when driving. The tires have a good tread, and they have appropriate air pressure.  This was the 1st time I\u2019ve ever experienced anything like this in a vehicle. After I got home from the trip, I researched online and learned that many people have experienced such events in the Ford F-250 and F-350. They refer to it as the death wobble.  It seems negligent of Ford to refuse to recall these vehicles or the parts that need to be replaced. If I had been on an interstate highway when this occurred today, I would very likely have had an accident.",
