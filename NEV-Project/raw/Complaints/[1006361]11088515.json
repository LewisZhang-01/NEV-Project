WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS, WHILE DODGE SAYS TO HAVE THE VEHICLE SERVICED IMMEDIATELY UPON THE LIGHT COMING ON, WHAT HAPPENS IF IMMEDIATE SERVICING IS NOT POSSIBLE?  ARE THE BAGS GOING TO DEPLOY AT ANY TIME?  WILL THEY NOT DEPLOY WHEN THEY SHOULD?  AS THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AIRBAGS IN THE VEHICLE, IS ONE BAG MORE AFFECTED THAN ANOTHER?  HELP NHTSA!  AIRBAG SYSTEMS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO FAIL IN ANY WAY.  MANUFACTURERS SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE!  THE OTHER COMPLAINTS LISTED ON THIS SITE SOUND HORRIFYING. THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL FOR THIS PROBLEM!",
