THE DEALERSHIP WAS A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR AWAY AND ABOUT 30 MINUTES INTO MY DRIVE HOME I NOTICED THE STEERING FELT LIKE IT WAS STICKING ON THE HIGHWAY AT AROUND 65MPH.

I LOOKED IT UP AND THERE'S LIKE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM.. THE SOLUTION SEEMS TO BE A NEW STEERING RACK ASSEMBLY...",
