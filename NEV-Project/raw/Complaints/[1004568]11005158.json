THIS HAPPENED WHILE TURNING A CORNER AND WHILE TURNING AROUND IN A PARKING LOT.---IT TOTALLY TURNED OFF AND WOULD NOT RESTART FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.  TOOK IT TO THE HONDA SERVICE THEY COULD NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT!  THEN IT HAPPENED AGAIN WHILE I WAS ON HIGHWAY 158-TURNING ONTO THE MAIN ROAD--I COULD HAVE BEEN IN A WRECK OR KILLED---WHEN I FINALLY MADE IT TO A SAFE PLACE THE CAR TURNED OFF AGAIN FOR 10-15 MINUTES.  THE HONDA SERVICE DEPARTMENT SENT A TOW TRUCK--HOPEFULLY THEY CAN REPAIR IT.---THIS IS A VERY UNSAFE SITUATION TO HAVE HAPPEN--THANK GOD I WAS ABLE TO CORRECT THE TURN!  IT HAPPENS WHILE TURNING--AND THE POWER STEERING LIGHT COMES ON!  THIS HAPPENED ON 7/10/17 AND 7/13/17",
