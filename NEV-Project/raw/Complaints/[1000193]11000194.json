TRACTION LIGHT COMES ON AND HAVE REDUCED POWER, RPMS ARE VERY HIGH BUT THE CAR JUST DOESN'T WANT TO GO.  SOMETIMES WILL TELL ME TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK THEN SHIFT TO DESIRED GEAR.  THE TRANS WILL NOT GO INTO GEAR.  IT LEFT ME STRANDED ALONE ON A MAJOR ROAD LATE AT NIGHT.  WHEN IT ARRIVED AT THE DEALERSHIP, THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG WITH IT. IT HAS SPENT OVER A MONTH AT ONE DEALERSHIP.  BEEN IN MULTIPLE TIMES FOR THE TRANS AND THEY DO AN UPDATE AND SAY ITS ALL GOOD.  THIS CAR HAS PUT ME IN QUITE A FEW NEAR MISSES.  YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE POWER YOU NEED.  THE TIMES I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE PROBLEMS, IT DIDN'T MATTER IF I WAS TURNING OR DRIVING A STRAIGHT LINE. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON WITH MY VEHICLE FOR 2 YEARS.  THEY PERFORMED A RECALL THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO FIX IT BUT I DID NOTHING.  ITS ALMOST LIKE IT GOT WORSE.",
