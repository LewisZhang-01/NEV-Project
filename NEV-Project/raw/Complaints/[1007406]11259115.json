I HAVE BEEN TO 4 MECHANICS INCLUDING ONE AT A FORD DEALER JUST TODAY. NO CODES SHOW, SO EVERY TIME I AM BASICALLY TOLD THAT THEY \"CAN'T DUPLICATE ISSUE\" AND I AM SENT ON MY WAY WITH NO REMEDY FOR WHAT IS A VERY DANGEROUS MALFUNCTION. I JUST CALLED FORD AND STARTED A CASE NUMBER TO SEE WHAT THEY WILL DO. JUDGING FROM OTHER COMMENTS I HAVE READ ON INTERNET, I AM NOT HOPEFUL. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY A RECALL WASN'T ISSUED AND HOW I AM JUST LEARNING ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM NOW-AFTER SPENDING $20K ON THIS VEHICLE.",
