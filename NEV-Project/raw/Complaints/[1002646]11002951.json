        "summary": "I BOUGHT A CPO 2016 A3 1.8T FROM AUDI OF PALO ALTO ON MAY 20, 2017 WITH A LITTLE UNDER 19100 MILES. GREAT FAST CAR. UNTIL JUNE 17, 2017 WHEN IT HAD 19878 MILES. THE CAR STARTED TO STUTTER/SPUTTER/JERK WHILE ON THE FWY. I WAS GOING ABOUT 50-60MPH ON THE FWY, CRUISING, AND THEN IT STUTTERED. IT LOST THE POWER TO ACCELERATE TO KEEP UP THE FWY PACE AND IT SLOWED DOWN CONSIDERABLY SO I PULLED OVER. I HAD IT TOWED TO THE NEAREST DEALER (AUDI OF CONCORD). IT WAS THERE FROM 6/17 TO 6/29. DEALER SAID IT HAD A FAULTY TURBO, STATING THE WASTEGATE FAILED, SO THEY REPLACED THE ENTIRE TURBO. I GOT THE CAR BACK WITH ABOUT 20072 MILES, SO APPARENTLY THEY DID SOME ROAD TESTS.    YESTERDAY, JULY 3, 2017, WHILE PICKING UP SOME GIFTS FOR MY DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY, THE ISSUE CAME BACK AGAIN. THIS TIME, MY WIFE AND 2 SMALL CHILDREN WERE IN THE CAR. WE WERE CRUISING AROUND 60-65 MPH. IT WAS SCARIER AS I HAD TO THINK FOR THEIR SAFETY FIRST AND FOREMOST. IMAGINE A CAR THAT SUDDENLY LOST ACCELERATION POWER ON THE FREEWAY AT AROUND 6:30PM. WE EASILY COULD HAVE GOTTEN REAR-ENDED.    ANYWAY, I RESEARCHED ON AUDI'S RELIABILITY AND DID READ ON SOME COMMENTS ABOUT HOW LOUSY THEY ARE. I GAMBLED AND DECIDED TO BUY ONE ANYWAY. BOY DID I LOSE BIG. AT THIS POINT, I'D RATHER HAVE A KIA OR CHEVY.",
