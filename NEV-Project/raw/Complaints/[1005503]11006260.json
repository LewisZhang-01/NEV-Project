HE CONTINUED TO DRIVE TO GET TO THE REST STOP WHICH HE DID NOT MAKE IT THE ENGINE JUST DIED , NO WARNING LIGHTS OR ANYTHING, SO HE HAD TO PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND CALLED FOR A TOW TRUCK, THE KIA WAS TOWED TO THE NEAREST MECHANIC WHICH UPON EXAMINATION OF THE CAR DETERMINED THAT THE ENGINE SEIZED UP AND WOULD NEED TO BE REPLACED, THEY COULD REPLACE IT FOR $5000-6000 SINCE THEY ARE A GM DEALER WE DECIDED TO HAVE IT TOWED TO A KIA DEALER WHO CAME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION AND WOULD CHARGE US $5875 FOR A USED ENGINE WITH 120,000 MILES ON IT WHICH IS MORE THAN OUR CAR HAS ON IT OR $7100 FOR A NEW ENGINE. WE HAVE A 2.4 LITER MPI WHICH IS NOT PART OF THE RECALL BUT SHOULD BE, THERE IS NO REASON A 4 YEAR OLD CAR WITH ROUTINE OIL CHANGES SHOULD BLOW AND ENGINE!",
