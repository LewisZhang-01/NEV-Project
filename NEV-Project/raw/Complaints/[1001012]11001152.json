WHILE I APPRECIATE THAT TOYOTA HAS INFORMED ME THEY ARE WORKING ON A REMEDY, I AM UNABLE TO SAFELY TRANSPORT ANYONE, BE IT MY GIRLFRIEND, FRIENDS, OR FAMILY, AS A RESULT OF THE POOR MANUFACTURING AND PLANNING OF THIS COMPANY. I AM FRUSTRATED, AS HIGH HUMIDITY AND FLUCTUATING HIGH TEMPERATURES ARE NOT NEW TO THE PLANET, OR TO CAR MANUFACTURING, AND I NEED A REPLACEMENT ASAP. I LIVE IN FL AND HAVE NO INTEREST IN TRYING TO RECTIFY A FATALITY AS A RESULT OF AN UNTIMELY CORRECTION OF TOYOTA'S OWN ERROR.     TOYOTA'S WEBSITE SAYS TO CHECK NHTSA'S WEBSITE IF I FEEL THE REMEDY IS NOT IN A REASONABLE TIMEFRAME. I FEEL THAT SEVERAL MONTHS IS REASONABLE, AND I'M READY FOR A CALL OR LETTER TO COME IN AND GET THIS TAKEN CARE OF. I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE FROM THIS MANUFACTURER WITH SAFETY AND RELIABILITY AS MY TOP CONCERN, AND I NEED YOU TO PLEASE HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR PROMISES.     \"REASONABLE TIMEFRAME\" IS NOT DEFINED, NOT EVEN BY A RANGE.",
