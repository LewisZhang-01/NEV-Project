ABOUT 30 SECONDS LATER AS I WAS DRIVING STRAIGHT AT ABOUT 25 MPH DOWN THE STREET, THERE WAS A LOUD CLICKING SOUND AND THE BRAKES LOCKED UP AND THE STEERING WHEEL LOCKED UP TOO. OR POSSIBLY COULD HAVE BEEN THE TRANSMISSION THAT LOCKED UP. I CAN'T BE SURE. BUT IT IS SAFE TO SAY THE ENTIRE CARE LOCKED UP LEAVING ME UNABLE TO STEER OR MANEUVER THE CAR IN ANY MANNER. I WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND THE LIGHTS WENT OFF AND I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR BACK HOME. I WAITED A COUPLE OF HOURS AND STARTED THE CAR AGAIN AND THE ABS AND SKID LIGHT CAME BACK ON.   THE CAR IS A 2014 JEEP COMPASS.",
