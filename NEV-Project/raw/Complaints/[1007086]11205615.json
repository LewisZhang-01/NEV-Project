TOOK THE CAR BACK TO KENNY ROSS CHEVY DEALERSHIP ON TUESDAY  4/30/2019 THEY SAID THEY WOULD ORDER THE PARTS AGAIN. THEY CALLED A FEW DAYS LATER SAYING THEY COULDN'T FIX THE SAFETY RECALL ON MY CAR CAUSE OF IT BEING AN OLDER CAR. I BELIEVE THIS IS WRONG IT IS A SAFETY RECALL THAT THEY REFUSE TO FIX CAUSE IT'S OLDER THE CAR IS STILL IN GOOD CONDITION LOWER MILES AND THEY WON'T FIX IT I DON'T THINK I SHOULD HAVE TO RIDE ALL OVER THE STATE TO FIND A DEALERSHIP TO FIX IT THEY CARRY THE GM NAME THE ARE SUPPOSEDLY A CERTIFIED SERVICE DEALERSHIP BUT THEY WILL NOT FIX A SAFETY RECALL THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 5 YEARS I THINK THEY NEED TO BE SHUT DOWN AND NOT CARRY THE GM NAME TOTALLY RIDICULOUS.",
