SINCE THEN, I'VE STARTED TO EXPERIENCE CLICKING/KNOCKING WHERE THE AIRBAG WOULD BE LOCATED AND THE AIR BAGS LIGHT IS ON AND OFF VERY FREQUENTLY AS WELL. IF I HIT A BUMP ON THE SIDE WHERE THE CLICKING OCCURS, THE AIR BAG LIGHT WILL COME ON. NOT SURE IF THE PROBLEM IS RELATED TO THE RECALL THAT WAS SUPPOSEDLY FIXED IN THE PAST, HOWEVER THERE WAS NO CLICKING/KNOCKING IN THE DASHBOARD PRIOR TO THE FIX, ONLY AIRBAG LIGHT. I JUST DON'T WANT IT TO BE AN AIRBAG ISSUE OR IT DEPLOYS WHILE I'M DRIVING. NOT ABLE TO PUT IN AN EXACT DATE BECAUSE IT HAPPENS EVERYDAY, SO ONLY ENTERED TODAY'S DATE.",
