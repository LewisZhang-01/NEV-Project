DODGE DEALERSHIP WON'T FIX THE ISSUE AS I'M OUT OF MY BASIC WARRANTY EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A MANUFACTURER DEFECT. I CALLED DODGE HEADQUARTERS AND THEY WON'T FIX THE ISSUE EITHER WITHOUT PAYING A $1000 OR SO PER DOOR PANEL. I'M VERY UPSET ABOUT THIS. APPARENTLY FROM READING ONLINE IT'S A KNOWN ISSUE FOR CHARGERS BETWEEN 2014-2016 I THINK. PER DEALERSHIP THEY SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF 2019 DODGE IS COMING OUT WITH VERSION 2 DOOR PANELS BUT WILL NEED TO BY THEM",
