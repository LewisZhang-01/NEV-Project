AFTER US DRIVING IT HOME AND SERVER MILES LATER IT WENT OFF.  HE SAID HE HAD FLUSHED THE TRANSMISSION OIL AND THAT HIS  MECHANIC HAD TOLD HIM TO JUST RESET IT AND IT WOULD BE FINE OBVIOUSLY IT WAS NOT FINE.   WE  TOOK IT TO OUR MECHANIC WHO IS A VERY HONEST MECHANIC HAD STATED THAT THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THE VEHICLE .     HE PULLED UP SOME RECALLS AND INDICATED THAT THERE WAS A RECALL DONE ON MODELS 04305 COROLLA UNFORTUNATELY THE VIN NUMBERS WERE 1ZZ -FE.   I'M CALLING THE DEALERSHIPS AND ALL THEY CAN TELL ME IS THAT THIS MAY HAVE BEEN AN EXPIRED RECALL ON MY VEHICLE THEREFORE IT'S NO LONGER UNDER THE WARRANTY OF THE RECALL .   THEY'RE NOT TELLING ME THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON THIS THEY'RE JUST SAYING THAT THERE IS NO RECALL ON THIS PARTICULAR VIN NUMBER .   WITH ALL THE RESEARCH I HAVE DONE I'VE SEEN A LOT OF THIS ISSUE HAS ARRIVED WITH OTHER VIN NUMBERS BUT NO RECALL HAS BEEN OPEN .    AT THIS POINT I'M NOT EVEN TOO SURE WHAT TO DO OTHER THAN GET A NEW TRANSMISSION OR REBUILT THIS TRANSMISSION.",
