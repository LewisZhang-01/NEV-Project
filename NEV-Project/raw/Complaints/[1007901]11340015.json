EXPLAIN TO THE TECHNICIAN EVERY TIME THAT IT IS BECAUSE THE OIL CIRCULATES AND DOES NOT RETURN AND BURNS OUT IN THE MIDDLE AND DISAPPEARS.  SO I CHECK THE AMOUNT OF OIL ONCE A WEEK AND ALWAYS REPLENISH THE AMOUNT.  ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING OVER LONG DISTANCES, IT'S SO ANXIOUS, YOU CAN'T STOP THE ANXIETY THAT THE OIL BURNS OUT AND STANDS ON THE STREET OR THE ENGINE ITSELF BURNS OUT AND BECOMES USELESS.",
