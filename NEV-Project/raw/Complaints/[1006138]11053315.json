THIS IS RIDICULOUS, IT IS A KNOWN COMMON PROBLEM THAT THE HEATING CORE IN THESE CHRYSLER 200 ON THE PASSENGER SIDE DOES NOT WORK...IT BLOWS OUT COLD AIR. TEMPERATURES ARE NOW BELOW FREEZING. I DO NOT SEE FAIRNESS THAT ANY OWNERS HAVE TO SPEND A GRAND OR MORE REPLACING SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY WAS MALFUNCTIONING IN MOST OF THEIR VEHICLES & MANY COMPLAINTS (INCLUDING MINE) HAVE BEEN SENT TO CHRYSLER. THIS HAS BEEN ON AN ISSUE NOW SINCE THE SEASON CHANGED & IT IS COLD. I DO NOT HAVE A GRAND TO SPEND NOR DO I HAVE WARRANTY ANYMORE .",
