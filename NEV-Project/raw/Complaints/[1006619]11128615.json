        "summary": "AFTER USING MY WINSHIELD WIPER ON 09/04/2018 THEY DO NOT TURN OFF. ANY TIME THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE ENGAGED, WHETHER THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION OR STATIONARY, THEY FAIL TO PROPERLY TURN OFF AFTER USE AND CONTINUE TO STAY ON FOR AN UNKNOWN PERIOD OF TIME OR UNTIL VEHICLE IS TURNED OFF, WHERE THEY CONTINUE ONCE THE VEHICLE IS RESTARTED. THIS HAS BECOME A DISTRACTION WHILE DRIVING, ESPECIALLY DURING CONDITIONS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE THE USE OF WIPERS OR WHEN THE USE OF WIPERS CAUSES A LARGER ISSUE BY FURTHER SMEARING SUBSTANCES THAT CANNOT BE SAFELY REMOVED BY THEM SUCH AS OILY LIQUIDS OR OTHER SUBSTANCES THAT REQUIRE A DIFFERENT WAY OF REMOVAL. THERE IS ALSO THE RISK OF WIPERS NOT SHUTTING OFF DURING CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS DURING A CARWASH WHERE THEY CAN BE PERMANENTLY DAMAGED AND RENDERED INOPERABLE WHEN ACTUALLY NEEDED DURING INCLEMENT WEATHER.",
