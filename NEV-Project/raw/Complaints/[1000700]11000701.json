I CALLED THEM UP AND BROUGHT THE VEHICLE TO THE DEALERSHIP BUT HAVE TO BRING BACK THE VEHICLE UN-REPAIR DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO FIX IT AND WITH EXCUSE OF PART IS NOT AVAILABLE. WHEN I CALL THE BMW CUSTOMER RELATION DEPARTMENT LAST WEEK JUNE 14, THEY SAID THE SAME THING AGAIN \"WAIT, AND CALL US BACK BUT NO DEFINITE SOLUTION\". WE NEED A REAL ENFORCEMENT CAR MANUFACTURE ON THE TIMELINE THE RECALL MUST BE REMEDIATE WHEN THE RECALL WAS INITIALLY IDENTIFIED, OTHERWISE CONSUMER WITH RECALL VEHICLE DOESN'T HAVE A PEACE OF MIND WHEN DRIVING A DEFECTIVE VEHICLE",
