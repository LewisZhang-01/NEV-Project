I regularly drive on a major highway and had this happened while on the highway it could have been catastrophic as speeds generally exceed 70MPH on this road.  The problem has been confirmed by my dealer.   Nissan will not back the repair as I am 3,015 miles out of warranty.  There were no warning lights prior to the failure.",
