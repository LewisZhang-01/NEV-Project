        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING, VEHICLE COMPLETELY LOST POWER/STALLED. POWER STEERING LOST, ALL ACCELERATION AND POWER ASSISTED BRAKING. INDICATOR LIGHTS FOR VARIETY OF SYSTEMS LIGHT UP. PULL OVER TO SIDE AND RESTART VEHICLE. VEHICLE EXHIBITS \"HAYWIRE\" BEHAVIOR, WITH INDICATORS FOR ALL SYSTEMS, INCLUDING TRACTION CONTROL TIRE PRESSURE, BATTERY, HYBRID ELECTRIC SYSTEM, PARKING BRAKE, ETC.GOING OFF. A SHORT VIDEO WAS TAKEN OF THIS BEHAVIOR WHEN RESTART WAS ATTEMPTED AFTER THE STALL. VEHICILE FAILS TO RESTART. AFTER ADDITIONAL TRY, VEHICLE STARTS, AND TRACTION CONTROL AND SOME OTHER SYSTEMS REMAIN NON FUNCTIONAL. VEHICLE IS RETURNED HOME, THEN RETURNED TO DEALER, WHO ADVISES THAT VEHICLE FIRMWARE IS UP TO DATE, AND THAT THE ISSUE \"CANNOT BE DUPLICATED.\" VEHICLE WAS UP TO DATE ON PREVIOUS RECALLS RELATING TO STALLS. THE STALL WAS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS,  AND DEALER DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM IS. WE HAVE BEEN SENT AWAY, BEING TOLD TO RETURN THE VEHICLE IF PROBLEM SHOWS UP AGAIN. WE DO NOT FEEL THAT VEHICLE IS SAFE TO DRIVE, AND DEALER HAS DONE NOTHING TO ADDRESS OR DIAGNOSE THE ISSUE THAT CAUSED THE PROBLEM. THE ISSUE CAME AFTER SOME OTHER ISSUES WITH VEHICLE SOMETIMES INDICATING THAT AIRBAGS NEED SERVICE, OR NOT RECOGNIZING THAT SEATBELTS WERE BUCKLED. I BELIEVE THE ISSUE TO BE RELATED TO PROBLEMS WITH COMPUTER FIRMWARE GOVERNING THE VEHICLE.",
