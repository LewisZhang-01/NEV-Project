        "summary": "THE GVWR IS 11,000LBS, THE HITCH WEIGHT IS 1650LBS,THE AXLES (2) ARE 4400LB RATED. THIS LEAVES THE AXLE WEIGHT 550 SHORT OF GVWR OF 11,000LBS. 4 OF THE FACTORY WHEELS HAVE CRACKED AND I REPLACED AT MY COST, I HAD TO REPLACE WHEEL BEARINGS ON BOTH AXLES ON THE RIGHT SIDE ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD MYSELF. I AM 77 YEARS OLD AND GETTING TOO OLD TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK. MY OUT OF POCKET COST ON TIRES, WHEELS AND WHEEL BEARINGS SINCE PURCHASE OF THIS UNIT IS APPROXIMATELY   $1250.00. I TRIED TO CALL KZ IN INDIANA ON PHONE NUMBER FURNISHED BY HUMPHREY RV SALES IN GRAND JUNCTION, CO, AND COULD GET NO ANSWER OR VOICE MAIL. I EMAILED KZ A MONTH AGO AND ASK IF THIS WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE OF COMPANY POLICY AND HAVE HEARD NOTHING BACK. I AM LUCKY I DID NOT HAVE AN ACCIDENT AND WAS ABLE TO DO THE WORK MYSELF. I HAVE READ ONLINE FORUM THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH OTHER BRANDS OF TOY HAULERS. I SPENT 50 YEARS DRIVING AND OWNING TRUCKS AND KNOW A LITTLE ABOUT AXLE WEIGHTS. YOU WOULD NOT LET MAKERS OF 18 WHEELERS GET BY WITH UNDER RATED AXLES. I HOPE SOMETHING CAN BE DONE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND NOT COST THE OWNERS OF THESE TYPES OF EQUIPMENT A SMALL FORTUNE. I DO NOT PULL THIS TRAILER OVER 70MPH AND KEEP AIR PRESSURE IN THE TIRES RIGHT AND KEEP THE WHEEL BEARINGS PACKED EACH YEAR AND ADD GREASE TO THE HUBS EVERY SIX MONTHS AS STATED IN THE OWNERS MANUAL  THANK YOU-[XXX]  *JS    PARTS OF THIS DOCUMENT HAVE BEEN REDACTED TO PROTECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).",
