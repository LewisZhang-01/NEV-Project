ADVISED DEALER IT WAS DEFECT. DEALER ARGUES IT COULD HAVE BEEN DUE TO HITTING A CURB. THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY ACCIDENTS, RUNNING OVER NAILS OR SCREWS OR HITTING ANYTHING WITH THE TIRE/CAR. THIS TIRE IS DRIVER REAR SIDE AND I FEAR A BLOWOUT COULD OCCUR. THE CRACK HAS MOST LIKELY BEEN PRESENT SINCE CAR WAS PURCHASED. THERE ARE NO SCUFFS, MARKS, ETC. ON TIRE. I HAVE PHOTOS BUT NO PLACE TO ATTACH THEM HERE.",
