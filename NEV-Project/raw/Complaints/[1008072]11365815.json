TWO MONTHS AGO, I REALIZED THAT AFTER FUELING MY CAR A REALLY STRONG SMELL LIKE GAS WAS PRESENT, I CHECKED UNDERNEATH BOTH I COULDN'T SEE ANY LEAKAGE, BUT I CHECKED THE DRIVER'S SIDE GAS TANK AND IT WAS KIND OF WET, I SAW TRACES OF GAS DROPLETS. I FOUND ONLINE THAT GMC POSTED A BULLETIN TO GET FIXED THIS ISSUE ON LOTS OF C6 CORVETTES, I TOOK THAT BULLETIN TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAID THAT THE TIME FOR THAT BULLETIN EXPIRED LAST YEAR ON JUNE, I EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT I GOT THE CAR ON SEPTEMBER AND ALSO MY CAR JUST HAD 3500 MILES, BUT THE SAID THAT IF I WANT MY CAR TO GET FIXED I HAVE TO PAY. I TOLD ME THAT IT'S NOT FAIR BECAUSE THIS ISSUE IS GMC FAULT. THIS IS WHY I'M FILLING THIS COMPLAIN WITH YOU. I WAS ABLE JUST TO UPLOAD ONE PIC BUT I HAVE MORE, SHOWING THE GAS TANK WET.*DT*JB",
