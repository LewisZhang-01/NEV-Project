        "summary": "I ACTUALLY HAVE TWO SEPARATE PROBLEMS WITH MY HYUNDAI. 1)MY CAR LURCHES WHEN I STEP ON THE GAS IF I'VE HAD TO SLOW DOWN OR STOP. I WAS CROSSING RAILROAD TRACKS BEHIND SOMEONE WHO SLOWED WAY DOWN.  THEY FINALLY GOT OVER THE TRACKS AND SPED BACK UP, I ALSO STEPPED ON THE GAS TO GO JUST AS THE RR CROSSING ARMS STARTED TO FLASH & COME DOWN, THERE WAS A TRAIN COMING. MY CAR HESITATED AND LURCHED WHICH GAVE ME A BIT OF A FRIGHT, SINCE THERE WAS A TRAIN COMING THREE BLOCKS AWAY.  I MADE IT ACROSS THE TRACKS WITH TIME TO SPARE, BUT HAVE ALSO HAD THIS HAPPEN WHEN I WAS PULLING INTO TRAFFIC. WHEN YOU PULL OUT IN TRAFFIC AT A BUSY INTERSECTION, TO HAVE YOUR CAR LURCH & PAUSE IS A BIT UNNERVING & MAKES ME LOOK LIKE A JERK DRIVER TO PULL OUT TO THEN ONLY PAUSE & GO. 2)THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS. WE HAD GOTTEN 5 TO 6 INCHES OF HEAVY WET SNOW.  I TOOK MY LITTLE SWEEPER & SWEPT OFF ALL OF THE WINDSHIELD AROUND THE WIPERS, SIDE WINDOWS & BACK WINDOW. I GOT BACK IN THE CAR AND TURNED THE WIPERS ON TO CLEAN THE WINDSHIELD MORE CLEARLY, THIS KNOCKED SOME SNOW DOWN WHERE THE WIPER RESTS & THE WIPERS WOULDN'T MOVE. IT'S AS THOUGH THEY COULDN'T GO DOWN AND RESET THEMSELVES, SO THEY WOULDN'T COME BACK UP. I GOT OUT & CLEANED AROUND THE BASE OF THE WINDSHIELD AGAIN. THERE WAS SOME SNOW ON TOP OF MY CAR WHEN I LEFT MY HOME THAT I WAS TOO SHORT TO REACH. STOPPING AT THE STOP LIGHT CAUSED SOME OF THE SNOW TO FALL FORWARD ON MY WINDSHIELD. I TURNED THE WIPERS ON AND THEY PUSHED MOST OF IT OFF, BUT WHEN THEY COULDN'T GO ALL THE WAY BACK DOWN THEY WERE UNABLE TO SWIPE AGAIN. THEY KEPT TRYING BUT THEY DIDN'T GO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO RESET THEY WERE STUCK. SINCE THERE WAS STILL SNOW BLOCKING MY VISION, I GOT OUT AT STOPLIGHT & SWEPT SNOW OFF MY WINDSHIELD & BASE OF WIPERS. LIGHT WAS NOW GREEN SO I QUICKLY JUMPED IN TO GO, MY CAR LURCHED (SEE #1) & MORE SNOW FELL FORWARD.  SAME SCENARIO, VISION BLOCKED.",
