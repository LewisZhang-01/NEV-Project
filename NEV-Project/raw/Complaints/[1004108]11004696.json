WHEN DRIVING AT 35-40 MPH ON A HIGHWAY THE CAR STARTED TO SURGE FORWARD, THEN BACK, KEEPING SURGING UNTIL THE CAR REACHED A HIGHER SPEED OF 60. IF DRIVING ON A HILL, IT WILL LOOSE ITS SPEED. I TOOK THE CAR TO FORD DEALER AND THEY COULDN'T FIND THE PROBLEM. THE CAR NOW IS 120000K, STILL SAME PROBLEM.  VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH FORD THAT WILL NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROBLEMAS.",
