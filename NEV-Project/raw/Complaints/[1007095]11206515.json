THIS IS WELL DOCUMENTED ANECDOTALLY - GOOGLE \"WRANGLER JK HOOD FLUTTER\". I SAW THE FRONT OF MY HOOD MOVING AT LEAST 1\" TO THE POINT WHERE I FEARED IT WOULD FLY UP OVER THE WINDSHIELD. I REPLACED MY LATCHES WITH THOSE FROM THE 2018-19 WRANGLER JL MODEL WHICH NOW USES A METAL RING IN PLACE OF THE RUBBER BAND ON THE JK LATCH. THIS INDICATES TO ME THAT FCA REALIZES THE JK DESIGN IS FAULTY.",
