SHORTLY AFTERWARDS, THE TRACTION CONTROL, ABS, AND AIR BAG LIGHTS ILLUMINATED AND THE RPMS FLUCTUATED WHILE DRIVING MY KIDS TO SUMMER CAMP OUT OF TOWN. WHEN I ARRIVED TO MY DESTINATION THE CAR WOULD NOT RESTART DUE TO THE BATTERY BEING DEAD.I GOT A JUMP START AND WAS ABLE TO MAKE IT TO A LOCAL STORE TO REPLACE THE BATTERY AT A COST OF $163 AND MAKE IT HOME. THE NEXT DAY I STILL HAVE THE SAME ISSUES.MANY OTHERS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AND IT WOULD APPEAR THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM. I WILL BE MAKING AN APPOINTMENT TO HAVE THE VEHICLE  TOWED TO THE DEALER. I AM SURE IT IS THE  ALTERNATOR AND I WILL NEED TO REPLACE AS OTHERS HAVE DONE. THE MANUFACTURER WAS MADE AWARE OF THE FAILURE. THE VEHICLE IS NOT EVEN PAID FOR YET AND THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS JUST OVER 52,000. I REALLY HOPE THIS ISSUE WILL BE INVESTIGATED SOON.",
