        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING MY 2005 TOYOTA TUNDRA ON THE INTERSTATE. I CAME UPON ROAD WORK AND SLOWED TO THE 45 MPH SPEED LIMIT. ALL OF THE SUDDEN THE TRUCK DROPPED TO THE FRONT LEFT WITH A LOUD CRASH. SPARKS WERE FLYING AND I LOST CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE FOR A BRIEF TIME. I WAS ABLE TO SLOW AND STEER THE TRUCK TO SAFETY. I GOT OUT OF THE TRUCK TO SEE THE FRONT DRIVERS SIDE WHEEL BUCKLED UNDERNEATH THE TRUCK AND MAJOR DAMAGES TO THAT SIDE OF THE VEHICLE. I'M VERY LUCKY TO HAVE SLOWED FOR ROAD WORK. IF I HAD OF BEEN DOING INTERSTATE SPEEDS OF 70 MPH I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HANDLE THE VEHICLE AND COULD HAVE HAD SEVERE AND FATAL CONSEQUENCES. EVERY DAY FOR THE PRIOR WEEK OR SO I NOTICED THE TRUCKS STEERING BEING WEIRD  (PULLING A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND NOT BEING ABLE BE STEERED WITH THE NORMAL EASE) AND IT MAKING A LOUD SQUEAKING SOUND WHEN TURNING.",
