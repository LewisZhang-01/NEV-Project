I CHECK THE TIRE PRESSURE AND INSPECT THE TIRE EACH DAY THE TRAILER IS MOVED.  ON WED, 8/14/2019 AT ABOUT 9:45 AM, ONE OF THESE TIRES THREW ITS TREAD AND CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE SIDE OF MY TRAILER.  I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER AND STOP WITHOUT LOSING CONTROL, BUT ONLY BECAUSE BY COINCIDENCE, I JUST HAPPENED TO BE CHECKING MY MIRRORS WHEN IT HAPPENED.  THE PSI WAS CHECKED AN HOUR EARLIER AND ONLY 20 MINUTES PRIOR THE TRAILER WAS WEIGHED AT 6900 LBS. (WELL UNDER THE AXLE AND TIRE WEIGHT RATING.)  THE MANUFACTURE AT THIS TIME WILL ONLY SUPPLY A REPLACEMENT TIRE WITHOUT ANY COMPENSATION FOR THE DAMAGE.  CASTLEROCK TIRE FAILURES ARE VERY COMMON AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE!",
