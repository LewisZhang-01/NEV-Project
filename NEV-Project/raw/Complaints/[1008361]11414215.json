THE FREQUENCY IN WHICH THIS OCCURS HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST WEEK. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO THE NISSAN DEALERSHIP. THE DEALERSHIP STATES THAT THIS IS A \"PREMATURE TRANSMISSION FAILURE\" AND IS RECOMMENDING A FULL REPLACEMENT OF THE TRANSMISSION AT THE CUSTOMERS EXPENSE. NISSAN/INFINITI IS WELL AWARE OF THIS ISSUE, BUT IS APPARENTLY TAKING NO OWNERSHIP IN HELPING CUSTOMERS WITH RESOLVING THIS PREMATURE TRANSMISSION FAILURE. THE BULLETIN THAT THE MANUFACTURE HAS ISSUED NEEDS TO BE ESCALATED TO A RECALL. AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS MATTER IS OVERDUE AS NUMEROUS CUSTOMERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS TRANSMISSION FAILURE.",
