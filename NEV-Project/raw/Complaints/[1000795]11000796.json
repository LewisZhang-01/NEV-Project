        "summary": "MY 16 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING HER 2009 FORD ESCAPE YESTERDAY.  SHE WAS GOING ABOUT 40 ON A CITY STREET AND COMPLETELY LOST POWER.  SHE WAS ABLE TO RESTART THE VEHICLE AND COME TO MY WORK ABOUT 1 MILE AWAY.  HER CAR DID JERK A LITTLE BUT SHE MADE IT.  SHE WAS VERY SCARED.  AFTER RESEARCHING, I FOUND THIS IS MOST LIKELY THE THROTTLE BODY ISSUE RELATED TO FORD CUSTOMER SATISFACTION13N03.  WE TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND SURE ENOUGH IF IT THE THROTTLE BODY.  THEY SAY, OUR VIN IS NOT COVERED UNDER THIS CUSTOMER SATISFACTION FIX.  I CALLED THE FORD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS TOLD THE SAME THING.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS. THE CAR IS LESS THAN 10 YEARS OLD AND HAS 146,000 MILES, SO IT QUALIFIES, BUT THEY SAY ONLY CERTAIN VIN# QUALIFY.  HOW IS THIS?  SHE COULD HAVE BEEN REAR ENDED OR INVOLVED IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT BECAUSE OF THIS.  HOW COULD YOU LET FORD GET AWAY WITHOUT DOING A RECALL ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS?  WE ARE OBVIOUSLY PAYING TO GET THIS FIXED, BUT IT IS RIDICULOUS.  THEY KNOW THEY HAVE A PROBLEM AND YOU EVEN KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM, BUT YET THEY WILL NOT FIX IT.  YOU SHOULD HAVE MADE FORD FIX THIS IN A RECALL FOR EVERY VEHICLE FOR THE SAFETY OF EVERYONE.  WHY DID YOU AGREE TO LET FORD BASICALLY PICK AND CHOOSE WHO THEY WOULD FIX WITH SUCH A HORRIBLE PROBLEM??  IT WILL COST ME 310.00, WHICH IS NOT FAIR SINCE THEY KNOW, BUT IT IS NOT WORTH RISKING MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE.  THERE HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS ON THIS VERY ISSUE.  WE BOUGHT THIS CAR USED, BUT IT IS NOT OUR FAULT THAT WE BOUGHT IT WITH SUCH A DEFECT.  WE WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT IF WE HAD KNOWN ABOUT THIS ISSUE.  WE RESEARCHED RECALLS BEFORE WE PUT OUR DAUGHTER IN THIS CAR, AND THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RECALL",
