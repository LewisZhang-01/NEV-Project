HOWEVER, WHEN TRYING TO PARK OR LEAVE A PARKING SPACE ON AN INCLINE OR DECLINE IT IS A PROBLEM. WHEN MOVING IN OR OUT OF A PARKING, I NOTICED THAT  MY GAS PEDAL IS VERY SENSITIVE. IT LURCHES MY CAR QUICKLY FORWARD. THIS IS NOT ABOUT MY PARKING TECHNIQUE. SOMEONE ELSE FAMILIAR WITH PARKING ON THESE STREETS IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE CAR'S ACCELERATION. IS THIS ISSUE RELATED TO NEEDING A REMEDY TO THE ABOVE RECALL NOTICE. IF YES, CAN I GET THIS FIXED FOR FREE EVEN THOUGH MY NOTICE HAS EXPIRED?   WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST.",
