IF I TRY TO CLEAN IT WITH CLEANER MADE FOR DASHES THE COLOR JUST SMEARS AND THE DASH MATERIAL ITS SELF SMEARS AND ANY KIND OF CAR CLOTH JUST LEAVES PATCHES OF STUFF FROM THE DASH BEING STICKY AND MELTED. THIS HAS BEEN A COMMON PROBLEM I AM FINDING ALL OVER THE WEB. WHY ARE OUR DASHES NOT BEING FIXED? THIS CAN CAUSE MAJOR ISSUES IF I WAS TO GET INTO A WRECK AND THE DASH JUST CRUMBLES OR SQUISHES BECAUSE ITS MELTED.",
