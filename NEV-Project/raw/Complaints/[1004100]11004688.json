        "summary": "THE AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT FOR THE DRIVER'S SIDE AIRBAG ON THE DASHBOARD GOES ON AND OFF AND HAS BEEN DOING THIS FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS. (I AM NOT SURE EXACTLY WHEN IT BEGAN, SINCE WHEN THE LIGHT WENT OFF, I THOUGHT THE PROBLEM WAS OVER) I HAVE HAD A CAR REPAIR SHOP TRY TO FIX IT SEVERAL TIMES, BUT THE PROBLEM HAS CONTINUED. THE WARNING LIGHT COMES ON AND STAYS ON (IN EVERY SEASON OF THE YEAR) WHEN THE WEATHER IS HUMID OR DAMP AND GOES OFF WHEN THE AIR IS DRIER. THE MECHANICS SAY THE AIRBAG WILL NOT DEPLOY WHEN THE AIRBAG LIGHT IS ON AND THAT I HAVE TO REPLACE THE AIRBAG AT A COST OF AROUND $400. I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS A TAKATA AIRBAG, BUT AM NOT SURE. STILL, IT IS DEFECTIVE AND I THINK THESE AIRBAGS SHOULD BE INSPECTED IN OTHER FORD FOCUS MODELS IN WHICH THEY ARE INSTALLED.  ALSO THE AUTOMATIC DOOR LOCK (LOCKING FROM THE DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT DOOR) STOPPED WORKING FOR THE FRONT PASSENGER'S SIDE DOOR MORE THAN A YEAR AGO. I NOW HAVE TO LOCK AND UNLOCK IT MANUALLY FROM THE INSIDE, REQUIRING THE PASSENGER TO WAIT OUTSIDE THE CAR WHILE I (DRIVER) GET INTO THE CAR AND UNLOCK THE PASSENGER SIDE DOOR. THIS POSES A SAFETY ISSUE FOR THE FRONT SEAT PASSENGER.",
