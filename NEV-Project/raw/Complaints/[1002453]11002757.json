WHEN MY HAIR CUT WAS FINISHED, I GOT ON THE BIKE THEN TRIED TO START IT BUT IT WOULD NOT START. I TRIED PUSH STARTING IT, JUMPING IT, AND STILL NO STARTING. THE MOTORCYCLE WAS UNDER WARRANTY SO IT WAS TOWED TO THE DEALER, THEY REPLACED PARTS AND STARTED THE MOTORCYCLE. THIS HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES AFTERWARDS, ABOUT TWICE MORE THAT SAME  YEAR, THEN THE NEXT YEAR, SPRING 2015, IT HAPPENED AGAIN,  THIS TIME IT LEFT ME STRANDED DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN. ON EACH OCCASION THE MOTORCYCLE WAS BROUGHT TO THE DEALER, EACH TIME THEY REPLACED A PART, UNDER WARENTY,  WHICH ALLOWED THE MOTORCYCLE TO START AGAIN. THE FOLLOWING YEAR, 2016, MY WARENTY HAD EXPIRED BEFORE IT HAPPENED AGAIN, I HAD TO PAY OUT OF POCKET TO HAVE IT REPAIRED. I CONTACTED THE MANUFACTURER TO COMPLAIN EACH OCCASION. AFTER THE WARENTY HAD EXPIRED, THEY REFUSED TO HELP ME AND BECAME IRATE AND DISRESPECTFUL DURING THE CONVERSATION. NOW AGAIN, SPRINT 2017, MY MOTORCYCLE WILL NOT START.",
