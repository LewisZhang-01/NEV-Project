        "summary": "TOOK VEHICLE TO NEW MOTORS BMW, ERIE, PA BECAUSE OF EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION.  WAS TOLD THE SEALS WERE BAD AND HAD TO BE REPLACED.  REPAIR WAS COMPLETED BY NEW MOTORS AND PICKED UP 7/1/17.  ON 7/8/17 I WAS TRAVELING AT 55 MPH ON I 90.  FELT A LAPSE IN POWER AND THEN HEARD A GRINDING NOISE FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT AND AFTER EXITING I 90 THE VEHICLE STALLED AND WOULD NOT RESTART.  CAR WAS RETURNED TO NEW MOTORS AND WAS NOTIFIED THAT A PISTON HAD EXPLODED AND PENETRATED THE ENGINE BLOCK.  AFTER RESEARCHING I LEARNED THAT THERE INHERENT PROBLEMS WITH THE N63 ENGINE WHICH THE CAR HAS AND BMW SKIRTED A RECALL FOR THE N63 PROBLEM BY THEIR VOLUNTARY N63 CUSTOMER CARE PACKAGE WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED BY NEW MOTORS.  HOWEVER, THE N63 CCP WORK DID NOT FIX THE INHERENT OIL LEAKAGE/CONSUMPTION PROBLEMS.  NEW MOTORS AND BMW NA ARE BOTH NEGLIGENT FOR NOT EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSING/CORRECTING THE KNOWN DEFECT AND PUT MYSELF  AND OTHER DRIVERS IN HARMS WAY BY PUTTING THE 2012 BMW 750 IX ON THE ROAD WITH THE PISTON THAT EVENTUALLY EXPLODED AND SHOT THROUGH THE ENGINE BLOCK.  AND, SINCE BMW'S N63 CCP HAS NOT EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSED THE INHERENT PROBLEM AND FOR PUBLIC SAFETY, A RECALL IS IN ORDER TO FORCE BMW TO CURE THE PROBLEM BEFORE SOMEONE IS SEVERELY INJURED OR KILLED AS A RESULT OF THE KNOWN ENGINE DEFECT.",
