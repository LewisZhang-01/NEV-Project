        "summary": "MY ISSUE IS WITH THE QUICKLY DEGRADING PAINT JOB ON MY VEHICLE. I HAVE DONE NOTHING DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER CAR I HAVE OWNED, AND I AM PARKED IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX PARKING LOT WHERE ALL OF MY NEIGHBORS CARS ARE NOT HAVING ANY ISSUES. THE ONLY CAR IN THE PARKING LOT WITH PAINT DEGRADATION COMPARABLE TO MY CAR IS A BLUE 1999 HONDA CIVIC, BUT IT LOOKS MUCH BETTER THAN MY '10 FIT. JUST TO REITERATE, WE ARE PARKED IN THE SAME PARKING LOT WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF SUN AND ELEMENTAL EXPOSURE.     AFTER LOOKING TO SEE IF MY VIN WAS LISTED UNDER CURRENT HONDA CAMPAIGNS, I HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS NOT LISTED. HOWEVER, A FRIEND POINTED OUT AN ONGOING CAMPAIGN FOR 2006-2013 CIVICS WITH EXTENDED PAINT WARRANTIES. THE CIVICS INCLUDED ARE ALL IN THE DARK BLUE OR BLACK COLOR FAMILY, WHICH IS THE SAME AS MY FIT. I LOOKED UP PHOTOS OF THE PAINT DEGRADATION ON THESE CIVICS, AND NOT ONLY ARE THE PAINT COLORS ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME, BUT THE DEGRADATION IS IN THE SAME AREAS AS THAT OF MY FIT. THE ROOF AND HOOD ARE THE TWO BIGGEST PROBLEM AREAS, AND THE CAMPAIGN LISTS ROOF, TRUNK, HOOD, UPPER PORTION OF THE DOORS, AND UPPER PORTIONS OF THE QUARTER PANELS. THE DEGRADATION DESCRIBED ON THE CIVICS IS A CHALKY OR CLOUDY APPEARANCE, EXACTLY THE SAME AS MY CAR'S CURRENT APPEARANCE.    NOW, JUST TO SUM THINGS UP:     1. MY CAR IS IN THE YEAR RANGE OF THE CAMPAIGNED CIVICS.  2. MY CAR IS THE SAME PAINT COLOR FAMILY AS THE CAMPAIGNED CIVICS.  3. MY CAR HAS THE SAME AREAS OF DEGRADATION AS THE CAMPAIGNED CIVICS, INCLUDING THE HOOD, THE ROOF, AND THE UPPER PORTIONS OF THE DOORS.  4. MY CAR HAS THE EXACT SAME TYPE OF CHALKY, CLOUDY, OXIDIZED DEGRADATION AS THE CAMPAIGNED CIVICS.  5. I AM NOT THE ONLY HONDA FIT OWNER WITH THIS PROBLEM. IT IS WELL DOCUMENTED ONLINE.  6. MY CAR STARTED DEGRADING WELL INSIDE THE 7 YEAR EXTENDED PAINT WARRANTY PERIOD GIVEN TO OWNERS OF THE CAMPAIGNED CIVICS.",
