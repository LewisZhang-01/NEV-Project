I HAD TO SLOW THE TRUCK TO APPROX. 30 MPH TO GET THE SHUDDERING TO STOP.  I DID NOT LOSE CONTROL OF THE 5TH WHEEL.  THE STEERING WHEEL SHUDDERED SO VIOLENTLY I COULD BARELY KEEP MY HANDS ON IT.  ALL VEHICLE WEIGHTS WERE WELL WITHIN THE GVWR/GCWR OF BOTH THE TRAILER AND TRUCK.  IRONICALLY ENOUGH I WAS ON MY WAY HOME FROM WEIGHING THE TRUCK AND TRAILER AT A CAT SCALE WHEN THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED.  FOUR DAYS LATER I TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE DEALER WHERE THEY REPLACED THE STEERING DAMPER ASSEMBLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH TSB 19-2274.",
