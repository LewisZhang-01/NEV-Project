        "summary": "THE DASHBOARD ON THIS VEHICLE STARTED \"MELTING\" AND BECAME STICKY AND GOOEY ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO.  I THOUGHT IT WAS DIRTY AND COULD NOT CLEAN OFF THE STICKINESS.    WHILE DRIVING THE CAR THERE WAS ALSO A REFLECTIVE GLARE COMING OFF THE DASHBOARD WHICH MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE WHILE DRIVING.  THE DASHBOARD ALSO EMITTED A STRONG ODOR THAT WAS MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO BREATHE AND MY EYES TO BURN AND CAUSE \" COUGHING.  I DID NOT REALIZE IT WAS COMING FROM THE DASHBOARD UNTIL I RESEARCHED IT AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A TOYOTA RECALL REGARDING THE \"MELTING DASHBOARDS.  I CALLED TOYOTA ON 10-19-2020 AND WAS TOLD THAT THE WARRANTY AND THE EXTENDED WARRANTY FOR THIS PROBLEM EXPIRED AND THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO.  I EXPLAINED TO THEM THAT I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED BY TOYOTA BY MAIL, PHONE OR EMAIL ABOUT THE RECALL AND THEY STILL SAID THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO.  I BELIEVE TOYOTA NEEDS TO HONOR THE WARRANTY TO REPLACE MY DASHBOARD AS I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED.  THEY SAID BECAUSE MY CAR WAS NOT SERVICED AT A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP SINCE 2017 THAT IS WHY I WAS NOT INFORMED OF THE RECALL.  I HAD MY CAR SERVICED REGULARLY, BUT NOT AT A TOYOTA DEALERSHIP.  TOYOTA SHOULD HAVE MAILED ME A RECALL NOTICE, WHICH THEY DID NOT.  IF I HAD BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE RECALL I WOULD HAVE /REPLACEMENT TAKEN IT IN FOR SERVICE",
