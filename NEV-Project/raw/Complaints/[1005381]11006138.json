THAT'S A REAL SAFETY ISSUE CONSIDERING I ACCIDENTLY BUMP IT, AND THE CAR WENT INTO MANUAL, WHILE DRIVING. I BARELY TOUCHED IT AND IT MOVED. THIS IS THE LAST GM CAR THAT I WILL EVER BUY ALWAYS SOMETHING WITH THEIR CARS. THE ACCELERATION FOR THIS CAR ON THE INTERSTATE IS BAD PEOPLE GO AROUND ME BECAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG TO ACCELERATE, IT ALSO HESITATES WHEN ACCELERATING. I'VE ONLY HAD THIS CAR FOR ABOUT A MONTH.",
