THE MOMENT I GOT IT, THE A/C WOULD NOT BLOW ANYTHING OUT, MY CAR WOULD STOP AT STOP SIGNS AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD WHEN NOT IN MOTION AND TRYING TO PASS TRAFFIC, WHICH IS COMPLETELY LIFE THREATENING. IT HAS A BUNCH OF ELECTRICAL ISSUES AND WILL START FLASHING (THE WARNING SIGNS) AND THEN STOP RANDOMLY. IT IS JERKING AT ALMOST ALL TIMES AND SHUTS OFF A TON, I HAVE GOTTEN IT CHECKED MULTIPLE TIMES AND SPENT MORE THAN I CAN AFFORD. THIS VEHICLE IS RIDICULOUS AND I INTEND TO TELL EVERYONE I KNOW!!! I AM ALWAYS SCARED WHEN DRIVING MY OWN CAR THAT I SPENT THOUSANDS ON, FORD NEEDS TO FIGURE THIS OUT",
