IT WILL NOW LOSE ACCELERATION AND THE RPMS WILL RANDOMLY INCREASE WHILE DRIVING.  THE RENTAL VAN THAT WE DROVE DID THE SAME THING.  REPORTS FROM OTHER 2017 NV 3500 OWNERS STATE THAT THEIR VANS ARE DOING THE SAME THING.  IT DOES NOT SEEM THAT MY VAN IS AN ISOLATED CASE AND I BELIEVE THE LOSS OF ACCELERATION WHEN THE VAN MALFUNCTIONS THAT WAY IS A SAFETY HAZARD, NOT TO MENTION THE POTENTIAL STRESS IT PUTS ON THE ENGINE AND TRANSMISSION.  I HAVE BROUGHT MY VAN INTO THE DEALERSHIP THREE SEPARATE TIME AND CONTACTED NISSAN COMMERICAL VEHICLES.  MY VAN IS CURRENTLY IN THE SHOP AT CREST NISSAN IN FRISCO, TEXAS.",
