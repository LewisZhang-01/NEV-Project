HE TOLD ME HE COULD NOT BELIEVE I HAD NOT HAD AN ACCIDENT BECAUSE IN HIS OPINION HITTING A MEDIUM SIZE CHUCKHOLE IN THE ROADWAY COULD CAUSE THE RIGHT FRONT OF THE VEHICLE TO COMPLETELY COLLAPSE.  THE MECHANIC INDICATED THIS DID NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT AND HAS BEEN ONGOING.  THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN PARKED IN A GARAGE AT MY HOME DURING ITS USE SINCE IT WAS PURCHASED NEW BY ME AND NOT ROUTINELY LEFT PARKED ON THE STREET.  THE MECHANIC ADVISED ME THAT IN HIS OPINION IT WAS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE VERY FAR.",
