IT HAS BEEN SINCE SEPTEMBER 2016 SINCE WE RECEIVED THIS RECALL NOTICE AND THERE IS STILL NO RESOLUTION. THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES AS WELL REGARDING OUR ELECTRICAL SYSTEM IN OUR VEHICLE. THE WIRING SYSTEM FOR OUR LIGHTS HAS GONE BAD AND HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED TO REPLACE THE WIRING. THIS VEHICLE HAS ISSUES THAT NEED RESOLVING AND I BELIEVE OVER 6 MONTHS OF WAITING ON A FIX TO THE AIR BAG/SEAT BELT RECALL HAS BEEN WAY TOO LONG. WHEN CHECKING THEIR WEBSITE IT SAYS NO REMEDY AVAILABLE STILL. I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING IN THIS CAR.",
