        "summary": "On my car there was a recall on the fuel pump filter housing. I've been to a dealer with this where they didn't replace the case. The car started to smell like gasoline. I opened the pump cover and saw a crack in the pump filter housing(is in the picture).I reported it to the dealer(honda Hamilton NJ) but they dismissed me saying it was not their problem because they did not replace the part. I reported it to honda usa where after three weeks they told me the same thing. On their website it clearly states \"HONDA WILL NOTIFY OWNERS, AND DEALERS WILL REPLACE THE FUEL FILTER SET ON THE FUEL PUMP ASSEMBLY...\". My question is why they don't replace the filter housing when it says it's a fire hazard. Thank You",
