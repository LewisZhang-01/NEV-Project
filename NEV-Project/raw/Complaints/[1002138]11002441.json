        "summary": "THE COWLING OR ENGINE COVER BROKE AT APPROX 28K MILES FOR NO KNOWN REASON. IT WAS REPLACED BY BRANHAVEN JEEP/DODGE OF BRANFORD, CONNECTICUT AFTER SEVERAL VISITS AND TEST DRIVES. THE LAST TEST DRIVE WAS FOR 45 MINUTES AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS, WITH MY WIFE AND THE MECHANIC, BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT FIND THE ISSUE. IT'S A PAIN IN THE BUTT RETURNING THIS VEHICLE TO DEALERSHIP 3X FOR THE SAME ISSUE--. NOW IT HAS BEEN REPLACED, BUT THE ISSUE HAS RETURNED AFTER ABOUT 6 WEEKS OR SO....MAYBE TWO MONTHS. DEALERSHIP IS SAYING THE SAME THING--CAN'T FIND THE ISSUE BECAUSE IT MAINLY HAPPENS AT ABOUT 69 MPH AND THEY SAID IT'S ILLEGAL TO DRIVE THAT FAST IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT. A STAR CASE WITH DODGE WILL BE STARTED ON THIS, I'M CALLING THIS WEEKEND. THE WHISTLE COMES FROM THE DASHBOARD INSIDE THE CAR, DRIVERS' SIDE, JUST LEFT OF CENTER. THIS NUISANCE IS A SAFETY ISSUE TO THE DRIVER AND A CULTURAL NOTE SIGNIFYING A COMPLETE DECLINE IN CHRYSLER PRODUCTION. IF THE ENGINE COWLS ARE CRACKING----THIS COULD SIGNIFY EARLY WEAR AND TEAR IN THE ENGINE CAUSING THE COWL TO CRACK AND SEVER THE BELTS. QUESTION: WOULD YOU WANT YOUR WIFE AND CHILDREN IN A VEHICLE WITH A WHISTLE COMING FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE CAR, THAT YOU HAVE VIDEO OF FROM A SMART PHONE, BUT THAT THE DEALERSHIP REFUSES TO \"FIND\"?",
