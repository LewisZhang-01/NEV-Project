AFTER WORK, I GOT INTO MY VEHICLE TURNED ON THE IGNITION AND BEGIN TO TURN TO GET OUT OF THE PARKING SPACE. AT THAT POINT STEERING BECAME VERY HARD, THEN ANOTHER INDICATOR APPEARED STATING \"SERVICE POWER STEERING NOW\". NOT KNOWING THAT THIS VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE A RESERVOIR FOR POWER STEERING FLUID, I DROVE TO THE NEAREST AUTO STORE TO PURCHASE POWER STEERING FLUID. AFTER RETURNING TO MY VEHICLE & LOOKING AT THE MANUAL I THEN FOUND OUT MY VEHICLE DOES NOT TAKE FLUID FOR POWER STEERING. I THEN CONTACTED MY DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE TO SEE IF THIS IS UNDER WARRANTY DUE TO I JUST PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN SEPTEMBER 2016. HOPEFULLY IT IS BECAUSE THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS.",
