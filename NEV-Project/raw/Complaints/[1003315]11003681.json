THIS IS A HAZARD BECAUSE I CAN NOT SEE THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME WHEN IT BRAKES UNLESS I WEAR SUNGLASSES. LEXUS HAS GIVEN A COMPLIMENTARY SATISFACTION REPAIR BUT WITH A DEADLINE TO BE ON A WAITING LIST. THIS SHOULD NOT BE A \"COMPLIMENTARY\" REPAIR, THIS SHOULD BE A MANDATORY REPLACEMENT FOR THE HAZARD IT CAN CAUSE THE DRIVER AND THE DRIVERS ON THE ROAD. I HAVE REPORTED THIS TO LEXUS HEAD QUARTERS AND THEY DENIED MY REQUEST FOR REPAIR DUE TO NOT BEING ON THE LIST BY END OF MAY 2017. WHEN IN MOTION, THIS CAR SHOULD NOT BE OPERATED BY ANYONE WITH VISIBILITY ISSUES.",
