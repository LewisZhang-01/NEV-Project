WHEN AT A FULL STANDSTILL SUCH AS AT A STOPLIGHT THE CAR WILL NOT ACCELERATE QUICKLY AND RESPOND TO PEDAL PRESSURE. WHEN THE PEDAL IS FLOORED AND TRYING TO START AGAIN IT HAS A LONG DELAY LIKE THE TRANSMISSION IS IN A HIGH GEAR OR IS OVERHEATED. I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN MANY ISSUES ONLINE ABOUT THE CVT OF THE ROGUE. THIS ONLY SEEMS TO HAPPEN WHEN IT IS HOT OUT. THERE ARE ALSO ISSUES WHEN GOING UP AN INCLINE IN HOT TEMPERATURE THE CAR DOES NOT RESPOND TO PEDAL PRESSURE AND ACCELERATION. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE IN THAT WHEN TRYING TO TURN LEFT AT A LIGHT I EXPECT MY CAR TO GO AND NOT STUTTER AND THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CLOSE CALLS TO BEING BROADSIDED.",
