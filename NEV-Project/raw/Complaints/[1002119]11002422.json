FOR YEARS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMPLAINING ON SOCIALS MEDIA AND THE NHTSA THAT THIS IS A VERY REAL ISSUE AND YET NO RECALL! I HAVE THE ISSUE.  I CAN SAY AT TIMES IN HOT WEATHER MY CAR IS ALMOST UNCONTROLLABLE. IT IS ALL I CAN DO TO KEEP MY STEERING TO GO THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO GO WITHOUT JERKING AND OVER CORRECTING.  I HAVE HAD THE CAR SINCE 2013. I AM THE SECOND OWNER.  EVERYTIME THE TEMP GETS ABOVE 80 THE STEERING STARTS GETTING JERKY AND STICKS. JUST GO TO FACEBOOK. BIMMER FORUMS. EVERYONE WHO OWNS A Z4 IS HAVING THESE SAME ISSUES.  IT IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE TO FIX. BMW DEALERSHIPS WANT TO CHARGE NEARLY 2000 FOR MY 2005 BMW WHEN THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE. UNLESS YOU FORCE BMW TO BE ACCOUNTABLE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET KILLED.",
