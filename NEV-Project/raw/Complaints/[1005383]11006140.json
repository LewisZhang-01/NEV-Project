        "summary": "SIMILAR TO ISSUES OTHERS WERE HAVING WITH THE THROTTLE CONTROL PLACING THE CAR INTO \"LIMP\" MODE, IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY AS MY WIFE WAS DRIVING THE CAR ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY NEAR PITTSBURGH (376 WEST, NEAR THE SPLIT OF 79 NORTH/SOUTH) WITH ME IN THE PASSENGER SEAT, AND THREE KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF 9 IN THE BACK SEAT.  WITHOUT WARNING, THE CAR SEEMINGLY SHUT OFF OR \"THROTTLED DOWN\" AND BEGAN TO SHIMMY AND SHAKE, LOSING MOST OF ITS FUNCTIONALITY.  WE WERE FORCED TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, WHICH WE BARELY DID, WITH VEHICLES SPEEDING PAST AT 4 LANE HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  THE FOLLOWING DAY, I CONTACTED FORD AND EXPLAINED THE SITUATION BUT WAS NOT TOLD ANYTHING ABOUT THIS SYSTEMIC ISSUE.  IT WAS NOT UNTIL I DISCOVERED THE ISSUE ON MY OWN, THAT I LEARNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT FORD HAS NOT ISSUED A RECALL FOR THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE BODY CONTROL BUT INSTEAD A \"CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PROGRAM\" WHICH WAS NOT COMMUNICATED TO ME, TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, UNTIL AFTER WE NEARLY LOST OUR LIVES AND I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED.  THIS ISSUE IS GOING TO GET SOMEONE KILLED (IF IT HAS NOT ALREADY HAPPENED) AND IT WOULD APPEAR THAT FORD FAILS TO APPRECIATE IT.  MY VEHICLE HAS JUST OVER 18,000 MILES ON IT.  I OWN 2 FORD VEHICLES BUT WON'T BE BUYING ANOTHER.",
