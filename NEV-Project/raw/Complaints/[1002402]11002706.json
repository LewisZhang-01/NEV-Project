        "summary": "I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE FROM A NEIGHBOR WHO BOUGHT IT NEW.  HE TOOK IMPECCABLE CARE OF HIS VEHICLES SO I WAS VERY CONFIDENT IN THE PURCHASE.  LESS THAN 2 YEARS AFTER WE BOUGHT IT FROM HIM, ONE OF THE REAR STABILIZERS TORE LOOSE FROM THE FRAME RAIL.  AFTER GOING UNDERNEATH TO INSPECT THE DAMAGE, THERE WAS A LOT OF HOLES AND MAJOR CORROSION THAT APPEARED TO HAVE STARTED FROM THE INSIDE OF THE FRAME.  I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT WITH THIS SOLID BOX STYLE FRAME, WHY IS THERE NO MEANS FOR ANY WATER OR CONDENSATION THAT BUILDS UP INSIDE THE FRAME TO GET OUT.  I WAS GOING TO HAVE IT REPAIRED UNTIL I INSPECTED IT FURTHER AND WHACKED A FEW PLACES WITH A HAMMER AND SENT IT RIGHT THROUGH THE FRAME!  IT WAS A SHAME BECAUSE IT RAN EXCELLENT AND I'M CONFIDENT IT WOULD HAVE WENT ANOTHER 100,000 MILES.  INSTEAD I WAS FORCED TO SELL IT FOR A PARTS VEHICLE AND LOST OVER $3000 ON THE DEAL.  IF THIS CAN HAPPEN TO A VEHICLE THAT WAS TAKEN CARE OF LIKE A COLLECTOR CAR, I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW FAST THEY CAN FALL APART IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY NEGLECTED.  IT'S TOO BAD THIS HAPPENS BECAUSE THEY ARE A FANTASTIC VEHICLE OTHER THAN THIS ISSUE.",
