WE ALMOST SIDE SWIPED A CAMPER BEFORE THE CAR FINALLY STOPPED. ANOTHER TIME DRIVING DOWN A BUSY HIGHWAY THE CAT JUST DIES. ETC LIGHT COMES ON. WE TAKE THE CAR TI THE DEALER AND THEY TELL US ITS BECAUSE THE OIL WAS LOW. I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW THE OIL BEING LOW IS GOING TO STALL OUT THE CAR, THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF OIL ISSUES. NO LIGHTS WERE ON IN THE DASH. THIS CAR IS UNSAFE.",
