        "summary": "2019 WHITE GTI SE WITH MANUAL TRANSMISSION PURCHASED ON 11/27/19 IN DALY CITY, CA. CURRENT MILEAGE ~ 2,300. CAR ENGINE SHUTS DOWN INTERMITTENTLY/ RANDOMLY AT LOW SPEEDS WHEN COMING TO A STOP, EITHER AT NEUTRAL OR IN 1ST GEAR OR REVERSE WITH CLUTCH FULLY ENGAGED. THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED WAS OVER TWO WEEKS AGO AFTER I SWITCHED DRIVING MODES FROM SPORT TO ECO MODE. THE ENGINE WOULD CONTINUOUSLY SHUT DOWN ALMOST EVERY TIME I CAME TO A STOP, TO THE POINT OF THE ENGINE SHUTTING OFF CONTINUOUSLY AND UNABLE TO REMAIN ON AS I WAS PARKING MY CAR ON A HILL. I TOOK MY CAR OUT FOR A DRIVE A FEW HOURS LATER AND IT DROVE NORMALLY, UNTIL IT SHUT DOWN WHILE I WAS SITTING AT A STOP LIGHT WITH THE CAR IN NEUTRAL, AND MY FOOT ON THE BRAKE. THIS PROBLEM OCCURS WHEN MY CAR IS WARMED UP AND AT NORMAL TEMPERATURES, USUALLY AFTER DRIVEN FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES. EVERY TIME IT'S HAPPENED, IT WAS ON CITY STREETS AND INTERSECTIONS. I BROUGHT MY CAR TO THE DEALERSHIP THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND THEY RESET THE ECU, AND WERE UNABLE TO RECREATE THE PROBLEM. HAVEN'T HAD THE PROBLEM REAPPEAR UNTIL A FEW DAYS AGO, AND WAS EVEN ABLE TO RECORD A VIDEO OF IT OCCURRING. MY CAR IS AT THE DEALER FOR THE SECOND TIME NOW FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.",
