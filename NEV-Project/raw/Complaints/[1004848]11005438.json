THEY KEPT TELLING ME NOTHING WAS WRONG, THAT MY BRAKES HAD SOME GRAVEL ON THEM AND THEY JUST CLEANED THEM.  I DON'T TRAVEL ON DIRT ROADS OR ANYTHING, CITY ROADS/HIGHWAYS.  NO OUT OF TOWN TRAVEL AT ALL, ACTUAL ONLY IN TOWN TRAVEL, HOME/WORK.  MY 2ND CONCERN IS, WHILE DRIVING SOMETIMES MY SPEED SEEMS TO SHIFT, AS IF THE GEARS ARE SHIFTING.  3RD CONCERN IS, I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE, DON'T RECALL WHAT IT WAS ABOUT BUT I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND I WAS TOLD THEY DONE THAT WORK LAST TIME I CAME IN BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS DONE, SINCE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN HONEST WITH ME BEFORE.  THEY DIDN'T EVEN LOOK AT THE LETTER.  IF I RECALL CORRECTLY BRAKE COMPLAINTS/ SERVICE STARTED 2011 OR 2012 TO 2014....",
