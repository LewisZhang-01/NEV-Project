I IMMEDIATELY TUNED AROUND AND THE ENGINE POWER WAS SO LOW THAT I BARELY MADE IT THE BLOCK HOME. I PARKED AND CALLED HONDA SERVICE. WHE I FOUND OUT THAT SINCE MY CAR HAD 47,000 MILES ON IT AND HONDA TOWING WOULD COST $160, I HAD THE CAR TOWED BY A LOCAL SERVICE FOR $100 TO THE DEALER. WHEN I CALLED THE DEALER ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY (IT HAPPENED ON A FRIDAY OR SATURDAY), THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE MECHANICS COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM BY STARTING THE CAR. NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO DRIVE IT. THE COMPANY INFORMED ME THAT THERE WAS CORROSION BETWEEN THE ENGINE WIRE HARNESS AND THE SENSOR CONNECTOR. THE PARTS TO REPLACE WERE THE CRANK SENSOR CONNECTOR, THE O RING, AND INTAKE MANIFOLD GASKET. THIS COST $1002.",
