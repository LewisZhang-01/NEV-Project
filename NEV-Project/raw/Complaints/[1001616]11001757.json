        "summary": "MY NEW ACCORD WITH A V6 ENGINE LIKES TO ENGINE BRAKE BY ITSELF. AS A RESULT IT WILL NOT COAST AND MAKES BRAKING UNPREDICTABLE AND VERY TIRING, ESPECIALLY WHEN DOING CITY DRIVING THAT INVOLVES STOP SIGNS AND RED LIGHTS. WHEN IN MEDIUM TRAFFIC BETWEEN 25 AND 40 MPH YOU CAN FEEL IT DOWNSHIFTING EVERY TIME. WHEN COMING TO A CORNER AND MAKING THE RIGHT TURN CAR JERKS AS IT DOWNSHIFTS OR UPSHIFTS.     I HAVE TAKEN THIS CAR TO A HONDA DEALERSHIP TWICE ON 6/23/17 AND ON 6/26/17 AND THEY FELT WHAT I WAS DESCRIBING BOTH TIMES AND DISMISSED IT AS NORMAL. THE CASE MANAGER I COMPLAINED TO ALSO DISMISSED IT AS NORMAL WHILE TREATING MY CONCERN AS NOTHING BUT A TYPICAL COMPLAINT INCLUDING WHEN I TOLD HIM THAT MY NECK JERKED ONE TIME AS A RESULT OF THE ROUGH SHIFTING. THERE ARE MULTIPLE COMPANIES ONLINE ABOUT THIS EXACT SAME ISSUE FOR THE 9TH GENERATION ACCORD AND EVEN OLDER MODELS, ALL WITH THE V6 ENGINE.    FOR REFERENCE I HAD THE EXACT SAME ISSUE ON AN 05 ACCORD V6 ON WHICH THE SAME DEALER FELT THE ISSUE AND SAID IT WAS BECAUSE OF BAD ENGINE MOUNTS. I HAD THOSE REPLACED AND THE ISSUE PERSISTED AND WHEN I TOOK IT IN AGAIN THEY CALLED IT NORMAL OPERATION OF THE TRANSMISSION AT THIS POINT (REALLY?!!). WHEN THE ISSUE GOT WORSE I TOOK IT IN TO A LOCAL CERTIFIED SHOP IN VALPARAISO IN (OTHER TIMES WERE IN CHICAGO) AT 59,000 MILES AT THEY REPLACED IT WITH A BRAND NEW TRANS FROM HONDA. THE ISSUE NEVER WENT AWAY.     MY MECHANIC WHO DROVE THE OLD CAR AND TEST DROVE THE NEW ONE CALLED THIS COMPLETELY ABNORMAL. THIS GUY HAS 40 YEARS EXPERIENCE WITH VEHICLES RANGING FROM TOYOTA TO MERCEDES AND A WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD WHO WILL VOUCH FOR HOW GOOD HE IS.    I AM TAKING THE NEW ACCORD IN ONE MORE TIME TOMORROW (6/28/17) TO THE DEALER OF ORIGIN BUT I AM GUESSING THE SAME ANSWER WILL ARISE. PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS. THIS ENGINE BRAKING IS NOT NORMAL.",
