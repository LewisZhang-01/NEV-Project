UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION WE DISCOVERED THAT THE TRANSMISSION FLUID AND COOLANT FLUID HAVE MIXED TOGETHER. THE TRANSMISSION WILL NEED TO BE REPLACED. WE ARE CURRENTLY FINANCING THIS VEHICLE, MAKING MONTHLY PAYMENTS, AND NOW AMONG MILLIONS OF OTHER NISSAN CONSUMERS ARE IN A HORRIBLE SPOT. NISSAN SHOULD HAVE ISSUED A RECALL FOR CRACKED RADIATORS. I WORK 12 HOUR SWING SHIFTS, LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN, AND HAVE 4 CHILDREN. NISSAN NEEDS TO MAKE THIS ISSUE RIGHT WITH CONSUMERS DUE TO THE SHEAR VOLUME OF DEFECTIVE VEHICLES AND THE IMMENSE COST AND UNFORTUNATE POSITION IT'S PUTTING HARD WORKING AMERICAN IN.",
