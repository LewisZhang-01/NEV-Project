THE METAL LEVER THAT HOLDS THE HARNESS STRAP TIGHT IS STILL IN ONE PIECE, BUT THE FRONT PLATE OF THE LEVER POPPED OUT OF PLACE FROM THE PLASTIC IN THE FRONT SO CAN BE MOVED. I CANNOT TELL IF IT IS POSSIBLE OR SAFE TO POP IT BACK IN.  I PLAN TO DISCONTINUE USE AND CALL THE MANUFACTURER. WE HAVE USED THIS CAR SEAT FOR A LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR.  IT WAS A HOT 90 DEGREE DAY.",
