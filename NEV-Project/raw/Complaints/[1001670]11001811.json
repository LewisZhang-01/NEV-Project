IN THE MIDDLE OF RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC, HAD TO COAST OFF THE HIGHWAY TO SAFETY.  NO PRIOR NOTIFICATION (LIGHTS, WARNINGS, NOISES) THAT THERE WAS A TRANSMISSION ISSUE.  CAR JUST RECENTLY EXCEEDED THE 100000 MILE POWER TRAIN WARRANTY.  WAS NOTIFIED IT WAS THE WAKE PLATE THAT FAILED.  CONSIDERING ALL OF THE OTHER CHEVY OWNERS HAVING THIS SAME ISSUE, I THINK CHEVY SHOULD AT THE VERY LEAST ACKNOWLEDGE THIS ISSUE.",
