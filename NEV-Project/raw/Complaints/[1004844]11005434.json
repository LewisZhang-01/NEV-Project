THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED I HAD IT TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID TO DRIVE IT. THEY INFORMED ME THAT JEEP HAD A SERVICE BULLETIN FOR THIS EXACT CONCERN AND THEY HAD FIXED IT BY REPROGRAMMING THE PCM. I PICKED UP THE VEHICLE AND ABOUT 4 DAYS LATER THE SAME THING HAPPENED WHILE TURNING THROUGH A BUSY INTERSECTION ALMOST CAUSING A MULTI VEHICLE COLLISION.SECONDS BEFORE THE STALL THE RED ETC LIGHT CAME ON. AFTER THE RESTART THE ETC LIGHT IS OFF AND THE CEL IS ON AND THE ENGINE FEELS LIKE IT HAS REDUCED OR NO POWER. THE STALL ALWAYS SEEMS TO HAPPEN ON A TURN. MY VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY AT THE DEALER BUT IT APPEARS THAT THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS HAPPENING. THIS VEHICLE IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AND IMPOSES A SAFETY RISK TO EVERYONE ON THE ROAD.",
