I TOOK IT IN BECAUSE IT WAS RUNNING POORLY, THEY DISCOVERED IT WAS 3 QUARTS LOW ON OIL, AND THEN HAD ME TRACK MY OIL CONSUMPTION (BY CHECKING THE OIL ONCE A WEEK FOR 2,000 MILES). CHEVROLET HAD A RECALL FOR THIS ISSUE (ONLY IF YOUR CAR WAS EXPERIENCING THIS) AND LUCKILY IT WAS COVERED TO BE FIXED. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE EXCESSIVE OIL CONSUMPTION, I HAVE HAD OTHER ISSUES AND PROBLEMS WITH MY CAR. ALL DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD, MY MANIFOLD CRACKED AND I NEED A NEW CATALYTIC CONVERTER. I DEFINITELY THINK (AND THE SERVICE ADVISOR AGREED) THAT THE REASON THAT MY EMISSIONS SYSTEM IS RUNNING INEFFICIENTLY, IS BECAUSE MY ENGINE WAS BURNING SO MUCH OIL. ALL OF THE OIL SOOT AND FUMES RUN THROUGH THE ENGINE AND EMISSION SYSTEM, THEREFORE CLOGGING UP MY CATALYTIC CONVERTER. SEEMS TO ME, THAT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE OIL CONSUMPTION RECALL. I CAN UNDERSTAND IF IT WERE ON A CASE TO CASE BASIS (JUST LIKE THE OIL CONSUMPTION RECALL IS), BUT IT SHOULD BE REPLACED IF YOUR CAR IS EXPERIENCING THOSE ISSUES. ALL STEMMING BACK TO THE OIL CONSUMPTION.",
