WE OPENED THE COVER TO THE SUN ROOF AND THE SMALLER SUN ROOF ABOVE THE DRIVER AND FRONT PASSENGER SEATS WAS SHATTERED, BUT THE GLASS REMAINED INTACT. WE CHECKED THE SURROUNDING AREA AND COULD NOT FIND ANY OBJECT THAT COULD HAVE STRUCK THE VEHICLE, OR PEOPLE. AS SEEN IN THE PHOTOS, THE GLASS WAS BROKEN OUTWARDS FROM THE CAR. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR, AND VISIBILITY WAS GOOD.",
