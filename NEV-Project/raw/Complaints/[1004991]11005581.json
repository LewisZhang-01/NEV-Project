THIS IS MY WIFE'S ONLY VEHICLE AND MY CONCERNS ARE AS FOLLOW. 1- WE CAN'T ACCESS THE SPARE TIRE AND EMERGENCY TOOLS SINCE THE DOORS DOESN'T OPEN. AND MY MAIN CONCERN IS 2- WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THERE IS AN ACCIDENT/FIRE IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE AND THE ONLY EMERGENCY EXIT IS THROUGH THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE UTILIZING THE REAR DOORS? DIFFERENT SCENARIO WHAT IF THE VEHICLE FALLS IN WATER AND THE ONLY WAY OUT IS TO OPEN THE REAR DOORS BUT THERE IS NO MANUAL LATCH TO EGRESS? I BELIEVE THAT MINI COOPER FAILED OR DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THIS MATTER. I CAN'T INCLUDE PICTURES BECAUSE I'LL BE SHOWING A SHUT DOOR.",
