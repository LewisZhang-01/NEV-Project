HTTPS://WWW.SALVAGERESELLER.COM/CARS-FOR-SALE/25069826-2014-TESLA-MODEL-S-VAN-NUYS-CA    THE FRONT SUSPENSION HAS FALLEN APART IN AN INTERESTING MANNER.  THE TOP BALL-JOINT  STEM HAS SIMPLY PULLED OUT OF THE CLAMPED SLOT WHICH IS MEANT TO HOLD IT IN PLACE CAUSING THE ENTIRE SUSPENSION TO FALL OUTWARDS.  I AM A WELL TRAINED ENGINEER AND IN MY OPINION THE DESIGN OF THIS SUSPENSION THAT RELIES UPON AN UNDERSIZED BALL-JOINT HELD IN PLACE BY CLAMPING UP A SLOTTED HOLE IN A BRITTLE ALLOY STEERING KNUCKLE IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.  I HAVE ATTACHED A PHOTOGRAPH OF A TESLA STEERING KNUCKLE FROM ANOTHER CAR THAT FAILED WITHOUT GOOD CAUSE. I CAN PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF THE INCIDENT THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT FAILURE.  THE KNUCKLE HAS SUFFERED BRITTLE FRACTURE WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED WITH SUCH A POOR DESIGN.    DATE OF INCIDENT IS AN APPROXIMATION.  PLEASE TAKE ACTION.  CONCERNED CITIZEN.",
