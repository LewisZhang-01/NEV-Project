I JUST CALLED MBUSA AND WAS TOLD THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY UPDATED INFORMATION AS TO WHEN SAFE AIRBAGS WILL BE INSTALLED IN MY CAR.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE NOW THAT I HAVE TO DRIVE IN FEAR FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS...AND NO ONE KNOWS FOR HOW MUCH LONGER.  I WANT A MB LOANER CAR, FREE OF CHARGE TO ME...TO DRIVE UNTIL THE TIME THAT MY AIRBAG RECALL IS CORRECTED.  AND I WOULD LIKE THAT CORRECTION TO OCCUR QUICKLY.",
