        "summary": "\"TAKATA RECALL\" - I RECEIVED MY LETTER ON JULY 2016 STATING I NEEDED TO REPLACE THE PASSENGER FRONTAL AIRBAG INFLATOR. SINCE THIS DATE I HAVE MADE 5 ATTEMPTS TO HAVE SOMEONE GIVE ME A SCHEDULE AS TO WHEN THIS ISSUE WILL BE RESOLVED. ONE YEAR LATER I AM STILL GETTING THE RUN AROUND FROM FORD. ON JULY 17, 2017 I CONTACTED THE FORD MICHIGAN HEADQUARTERS AND THEY TOLD ME TO CALL CUSTOMER RELATIONS AT 800-392-3673. THE CONVERSATION BEGAN WITH THE SAME EXCUSE THAT THEY WERE WORKING ON THE PROBLEM AND I WOULD RECEIVE A LETTER WHEN THE AIR BAG COULD BE REPLACED.  IT WAS AT THAT TIME I STATED I WANTED THEM TO OPEN A CASE FILE FOR ME. THE NUMBER I RECEIVED FOR THE OPEN CASE IS CAS12729115. NOT ALLOWING ANYONE TO SIT IN THE PASSENGER SEAT FOR ONE YEAR HAS CAUSED AN ENORMOUS BURDEN ON MY FAMILY FOR FEAR THAT SERIOUS INJURY MAY RESULT.  YOUR HELP IN THIS MATTER WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.",
