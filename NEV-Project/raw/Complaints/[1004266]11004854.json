        "summary": "THE WIPERS AND HEADLIGHTS WOULD RANDOMLY COME IN AND OUT OF WORKING CONDITIONS. YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN WIPERS ARE WORKING UNTIL IT STARTS RAINING SO IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS. WE HAD TO PULL OVER AND EITHER WAIT FOR THE RAIN TO STOP OR WAIT UNTIL THE WIPERS STARTED WORKING AGAIN.   THE BACKUP CAMERA ALSO COMES IN AND OUT. YOU CAN SEE THE SCREEN WARNING YOU TO BE CAREFUL BUT THE CAMERA ITSELF IS ABSENT.  THE DOOR HANDLE FELL OFF ONTO THE FLOOR WITH NO PRIOR WARNING. NO ONE HIT IT OR ANYTHING. WE OPENED THE BACKSEAT IN FRONT OF OUR HOME THEN DROVE TO THE AIRPORT AND TRIED TO OPEN IT AGAIN AND IT FELL OFF ONTO THE GROUND. THE TOP OF THE DOOR HANDLE AND PARTS INSIDE THAT MAKE THE HANDLE WORK.  AND NOW MOST RECENTLY OUR AC IS NOT WORKING PROPERLY COMING IN AND OUT OF PROPER FUNCTION, NOR ARE OUR HEADLIGHTS WORKING AGAIN. YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN HEADLIGHTS ARE WORKING UNTIL YOU NEED THEM SO WE USED FOG LIGHTS INSTEAD AS EVENING JUST SET AND WE COULDN'T WAIT FOR THE SUN TO COME OUT TO CONTINUE DRIVING.  FOR A BRAND NEW CAR THERE ARE MANY ISSUES WITH THIS CAR, OTHERWISE WE LOVE IT AND THE WAY IT DRIVES AND BRAKES SO WELL.",
