I CAN TURN THE VEHICLE OFF AND RESTART IT, AND SOMETIMES THE INDICATOR WORKS PROPERLY AND SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT. I EXPERIENCE THE SAME PROBLEM SOMETIMES WHEN THE PASSENGER SEAT IS OCCUPIED. MY CONCERN IS THE FACT I DON'T KNOW IF MY AIRBAG IS OPERATIONAL OR NOT. I CONTACTED MY LOCAL DEALER AND WAS INFORMED I WOULD BE CHARGED $99 TO JUST HAVE IT CHECKED.  I HAVE NOT DONE SO.",
