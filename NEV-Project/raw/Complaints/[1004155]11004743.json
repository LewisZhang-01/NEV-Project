I HAVE HAD SEVERAL CLOSE CALLS WITH SOME SERIOUS ACCIDENTS. I HAVE ALMOST BEEN T-BONED SEVERAL TIMES DUE TO IT POWERING DOWN AND NOT BEING ABLE TO TURN. I HAVE CALLED THE GM DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT THIS AND THEY ARE AWARE OF THE RECALL. IT'S GOING TO BE A HEFTY LAWSUIT ON THEIR HANDS WHEN SOMEONE IS SERIOUSLY HURT OR DIES BECAUSE THEIR STEERING WHEEL LOCKS UP. EARLY JUNE IS WHEN I STARTED NOTICING THIS ISSUE AND IT HAS ONLY BEEN GETTING WORSE!",
