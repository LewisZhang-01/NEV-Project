IT SHOULD MANDATED THAT THE HEAD REST ALSO COME WITH 2 OR 3 (FORWARD AND BACK ADJUSTMENT OPTIONS) ALL YOU CAN DO IS MOVE UP OR DOWN. I AM TINY. I HAVE TO SIT CLOSE TO THE WHEEL--AND THIS HEADREST JUTS ME FORWARD AND HAS CAUSED ME HORRIBLE NECK PAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE. I AM 39 YEARS OLD.  I KNOW THIS WAS TESTED ON DUMMIES AND IT FOR PREVENTION OF WHIPLASH-- BUT CAN CAR COMPANIES --MAKE THEM ADJUSTABLE??????????? FORWARD AND BACK ???????  NOT JUST UP AND DOWN. FORWARD HEAD POSTURE IS ALSO LEADING TO HORRIBLE POSTURE PROBLEMS, ARTHRITIS, NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASES FROM THE SPINAL CORD BEING SQUEEZED FROM FORWARD HEAD WHICH IS ALREADY HAPPENING FROM TEXTING AND COMPUTER USE...  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS GOT PASSED ?  I HAVE TO PLAY IN SO MANY WAYS AND TURN THE HEADREST BACKWARDS AND HAVE TRIED TO USE THE BACK SEAT HEADREST ....  NHTSA...MAY READ THIS AND GO----WHIPLASH ETC.. BUT THIS IS SO UPSETTING AND DISTRESSING ---FOR ME TO DRIVE WITH....MY NECK IS IN TERRIBLE SPASM ...  CHANGE HEAD REST SETTINGS",
