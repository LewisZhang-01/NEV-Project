        "summary": "ON JUNE 17, 2017 WHILE DRIVING IN CALIFORNIA ON THE HIGHWAY,  THE ROGUE BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN AND NOT MAINTAIN SPEED. THE ROGUE WAS DRIVING SMOOTHLY AND ALL OF SUDDEN IT SLOWED DOWN FROM 75-80  MPH TO 60 MPH . I PUSHED THE GAS PEDAL ALL THE WAY TO FLOOR AND EVEN TURNED ON MY OVERDRIVE BUTTON WITH NO LUCK. THIS ISSUED LASTED FOR SEVERAL MILES UNTIL IT JUST STARTED WORKING AGAIN. THIS PROBLEM CONTINUED OFF AND ON FOR THE ENTIRE TRIP TO AND FROM CALIFORNIA . THERE WAS EVEN MULTIPLE INSTANCES WHERE THE ROGUE WOULD NOT EXCELERATE  AFTER STOPPING AT A STOP LIGHT . I PUSHED THE GAS MEDAL TO THE FLOOR AND IT WOULD MOVE MORE THAN 5-10 MPH FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET UNTIL IT WORKED AGAIN. WE HAVE OWNED THIS VEHICLE FOR 3 YEARS NOW AND HAVEN'T HAD A PROBLEM UNTIL NOW. WE LIVE IN ARIZONA WITH EXTREME HEAT AND I HAVE READ OTHER PEOPLE'S POSTS ABOUT HEAT COULD BE A PROBLEM, HOWEVER WE SEE EXTREME TEMPERATURES EVERY YEAR SINCE WE OWNED IT WITH NO PROBLEMS UNTIL NOW.",
