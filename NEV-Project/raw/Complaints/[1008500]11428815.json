I took the vehicle to my local Nissan dealership for check up, but they claim the vehicle drives normal. Knowing that this generation of Nissan Altimas has defective transmissions and a class action lawsuit was settled with an extension of transmission warranty for 2 years or 24,000 miles. Thank you",
