SERVICE AIR BAG, TIRE MONITORING SYSTEM, FRONT CAMERA, PARKING ASSIST, SIDE DETECTION SYSTEM, AND THEFT DETERRENT SYSTEM.    THE CAR IT BASICALLY UNDRIVEABLE. THE BLINKERS DO NOT WORK, HEATED SEATS (THOUGH THAT IS MINOR) RADIO STOPS WORKING. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ENGINE IS, HOW MUCH FUEL WE HAVE AND HOW FAST WE ARE GOING. THERE IS ONLY 68,800 MILES ON IT. WHEN I CALL THE DEALERSHIP (THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES WITH THE TECHNOLOGY TO LOOK AT THIS AND TROUBLESHOOT) THEY TELL ME IT'S A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS JUST TO RUN DIAGNOSTICS. THIS IS RIDICULOUS THAT THE CAR IS THIS UNSAFE TO DRIVE BUT I HAVE TO PAY TO DIAGNOSE IT. THEN I FIND OUT JUST TO REPLACE THE SIDE DETECTION SYSTEM WILL COST ME LIKE $700. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO FIX THIS BIGGER ISSUE. I'M FORCED TO PAY TO HAVE DIAGNOSTICS RUN AT THIS POINT BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE MY WIFE AND DAUGHTER DRIVING AROUND IN THIS VEHICLE WHEN IT'S THIS UNSAFE. I ALSO HAVE A VIDEO I CAN UPLOAD IF NEEDED. BUT FOR NOW I TOOK SCREENSHOTS OF THE VIDEO AND WILL UPLOAD THEM.     WHAT CAN BE DONE ON STUFF LIKE THIS?     I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME,    JASON",
