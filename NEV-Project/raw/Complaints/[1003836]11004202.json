THE DAMAGE LOOKS TO BE ENTIRELY SELF INFLICTED DUE TO THE SUSPENSION FAILURE.  IT IS OBVIOUS THAT TESLA HAS A CULTURE THAT REFUSES TO RECOGNISE THESE REPEATED SUSPENSION FAILURES AND BY THEIR USE OF NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS DISCOURAGES OWNERS FROM REPORTING TO THE AUTHORITIES.  I BELIEVE IT IS LONG OVERDUE FOR NHTSA TO INVESTIGATE THESE MATTERS.   THANK YOU.  CONCERNED CITIZEN.    DATE OF INCIDENT IS AN APPROXIMATION.",
