IN ALL THAT BIZZARENESS, I FELT I MISSED A GREEN LIGHT AS WELL. I THOUGHT MAY BE THE VEHICLE BESIDES ME STARTED DRIVING AND IT WAS MY VISION WHICH MADE ME THINK THAT MY VEHICLE MOVED BACKWARDS BUT I AM A LONG TIME DRIVER AND SOMETHING LIKE THAT NEVER HAPPENED WITH ME BEFORE. I WAS COMPLETELY SHAKEN UP, THINKING THAT LUCKILY NO VEHICLE WAS BEHIND ME DURING ALL THAT TIME. I ALSO NOTICED THAT MY VEHICLE WAS AT LEAST ONE VEHICLE SPACE BEHIND THE STOPPAGE LINE WHEN I STARTED DRIVING AGAIN. THIS STRENGTHENED MY BELIEF THAT MY VEHICLE MOVED BACKWARDS.",
