The way the sunshine hit the frost on the windshield it shined to bright for me to see. How is this safe? I have seen where many people are having this issue online. It just blows cold air on the passenger side vents. No police were involved but I could\u2019ve ended up in the hospital all because of a little part that won\u2019t get recalled.",
