        "summary": "First my car started consuming and alarming amont of oil at 40000 to 50000 miles in 2020. I have been put through 3 oil consumption test and every 1,000 miles i took it in it was consuming more oil. One time it had lost 4 quart of oil in 1,000 miles with no oil leaks detected.  They never did anything about it. Early 2021 While i was on the highway in traffic going 70 miles per hour. Mile car started to sputter and slowed down to 30 miles per hour in the middle of the highway at night. I was so afraid that i would be hit. Another time it slowed down on the highway 1 day after i got an oil change and i was out of town on a sunday. The car was struggling to get up a highway hill at 25 miles an hour with other cars going well over the 70 mile speed limt. I was terrified.  The dealer finally admitted that the engin is bad but Hyundai will not replace it. Help please!!!!!",
