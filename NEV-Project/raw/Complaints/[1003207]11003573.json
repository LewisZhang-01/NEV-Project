I HAVE TO WAIT ABOUT 10-15 MINUTES AFTER THE INITIAL START BEFORE IT WILL FINALLY START UP. ONCE IT DOES IT RUNS JUST FINE UNTIL THE NEXT TIME. THIS IS VERY ANNOYING AND SUCH AN INCONVENIENCE AS WELL AS NOT SAFE. I WAS LEAVING FROM TAKING MY SON TO THE ER ONE MORNING AT LIKE 3AM AND IT DONE THIS. SO I AM SITTING AN THE ER PARKING LOT WITH A SICK 2 YEAR OLD AT 3AM. THANK GOD IT WASN'T WHEN I HAD TO TAKE HIM IN. WHAT IF I WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT AND SOMETHING WORSE COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO MY CHILD. THIS NEEDS TO BE RECALLED AND FIXED. I HAVE SEEN NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ON THIS.",
