        "summary": "MY 1998 V-TEC HONDA PRELUDE RECENTLY HIT 157000 MILES AND SHORTLY AFTER HAS BEEN EXPERIENCING LOSS OF POWER, STALLING, AND LOSS OF STEERING.  WITHIN 5 WEEKS I HAVE EXPERIENCED IT STALL AND INSTANTLY RESTART WHILE GOING THROUGH AN INTERSECTION, LOSE ALL POWER AND STEERING WHILE TURNING THROUGH AN INTERSECTION, AND LOSE POWER AND STEERING WHILE GOING 55 MPH DOWN THE HIGHWAY.  UPON DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THIS WEBSITE, ACROSS THE INTERNET AND SPEAKING WITH SOME MECHANICS I BELIEVE THESE ISSUES TO BE IN LINE WITH TWO MAJOR RECALLS THAT WERE DONE ON MY YEAR MAKE AND MODEL OF VEHICLE HOWEVER I HAVE COME TO FIND OUT THAT MY VEHICLE AMONG MANY OTHERS WERE EXCLUDED FROM THESE RECALLS (RECALL #'S 99V069000, 02V12000).  MOST OF THESE ISSUES WOULD NOT EVEN PRESENT THEMSELVES UNTIL THE CAR REACHED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WEAR AND TEAR AND THE FACT THAT SOME VEHICLES WERE EXCLUDED WHEN THEY PRESENT THE SAME ISSUES IS DEPLORABLE AND HAS PUT MANY LIVES AT RISK AS THESE ARE BOTH CONSIDERED LIFE THREATENING ISSUES.",
