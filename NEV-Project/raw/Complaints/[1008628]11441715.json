To down shift that quickly on the highway placed me in a very unsafe position. My car almost came to a complete stop without any notice to the vehicle behind me. Someone could have rear ended because I didn't hit my breaks. Thank God the car behind me was pretty far back, because if they had been a little closer, they would have hit me.",
