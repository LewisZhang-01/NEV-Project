MY VEHICLE SUSTAINED SIGNIFICANT FRONT END DAMAGE.  SO MUCH SO, IT'S A TOTAL LOSS.  THE MOST ALARMING DETAIL IS THAT MY AIRBAGS DIDN'T DEPLOY AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT!!  NEITHER THE DRIVER SIDE NOR THE PASSENGER SIDE.  I KNOW THAT FORD HAS A NUMBER OF RECALLS IN REGARDS TO DEFECTIVE AIRBAGS BUT I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING IN REGARDS TO THE 2013 FORD EXPLORER EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS.  FORD REALLY NEEDS TO LOOK INTO THESE DEFECTIVE AIRBAGS WITHIN THIS MODEL BEFORE SOMEONE IS KILLED OR SEVERELY INJURED.   NO WARNING LIGHTS, NO AIRBAG LIGHTS, ETC...  FORD IS EVEN REFUSING TO SEND A \"REP\" TO WHERE MY VEHICLE IS BEING HELD TO CONDUCT AN INSPECTION OF IT...",
