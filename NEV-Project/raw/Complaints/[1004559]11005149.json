I HAD TO STRUGGLE TO GET THE VEHICLE ON TO THE SHOULDER IN ORDER TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT. ONCE STOPPED, I GOT NO RESPONSE OF ANY KIND FROM THE STARTER, ALTHOUGH I HAD POWER TO THE BLOWER MOTOR, RADIO, AND POWER WINDOWS. AFTER 5 MINUTES, I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAR STARTED.I TURNED AROUND TO DRIVE HOME, AND 5 MINUTES LATER THE PROBLEM RECURRED EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  THE VEHICLE IS NOW IN THE SHOP FOR REPAIR AS IT IS NOT SAFE TO DRIVE. I PRESUME THAT I AM DEALING WITH A CATASTROPHIC IGNITION SYSTEM FAILURE OF THE TYPE THAT CAUSED GM TO ISSUE IT'S MASSIVE RECALL 5-6 YEARS AGO.",
