WHEN I TRIED TO OPEN THE DOOR USING MY KEY FOB, THE DOOR OPENED, BUT THEM PROCEED TO MAKE A HIGH PITCHED BEEPING NOISE (LIKE WHEN YOU TRY TO LOCK THE DOORS WHILE ONE OF THE DOORS IS OPEN).  THE DOORS DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY CLOSE AND IT NEEDS TO BE MANUALLY CLOSED.  AFTER INVESTIGATING, I NOTICED THAT THE CABLE OF THE VEHICLE WAS SEVERED. THE CAR HAS BEEN ROUTINELY MAINTAINED AS SUGGESTED BY TOYOTA AND HAS 39,000 MILES ON THE VEHICLE AND WE ARE THE ORIGINALLY OWNERS OF THE CAR.",
