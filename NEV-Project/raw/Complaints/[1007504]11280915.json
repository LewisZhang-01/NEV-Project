        "summary": "THE CAR WAS PLACED IN PARK AND THE DASH SHOWED NEUTRAL. THE KEY COULD BE REMOVED AND THE CAR TURNED ON AND OFF BUT UNABLE TO SHIFT THE CAR INTO ANY GEAR SUCH AS DRIVE OR REVERSE.  USING GOOGLE AND A YOUTUBE VIDEO I WAS ABLE TO LOCATE THE OVERRIDE FOR THE SHIFTER AND PUT CAR IN DRIVE AND DRIVE THE ONE MILE TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE DEALERSHIP OFFERED NO REAL ASSISTANCE OR ADVISE ON WHAT TO DO OTHER THAN 'GET THE CAR TO THEM' AND A STATEMENT THAT THE ISSUE SOUNDED 'JUST LIKE A RECALL' - 'BUT THE RECALL  IS NOT ON YOUR CAR'.  PER THE DEALERSHIP THE SHIFT CABLE BUSHING WAS WORN AND CABLE CAME LOOSE FROM TRANSMISSION. THIS APPEARS TO BE THE EXACT SAME DEFECT AS NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 19V362000 HOWEVER MY VEHICLE IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL AND I WAS CHARGED $258 FOR REPLACEMENT OF A $6.35 PART THAT IS KNOWN TO BE AN ISSUE. THIS RECALL SHOULD BE REVIEWED AND EXPANDED IF ADDITIONAL VEHICLES ARE AFFECTED. THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN TO HAVE YOUR SHIFTER AND TRANSMISSION CEASE COMMUNICATION.",
