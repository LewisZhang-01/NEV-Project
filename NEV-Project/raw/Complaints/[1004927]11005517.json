ADVANCE AUTO WAS ABLE TO RUN THE DIAGNOSTIC AND SAID MY BATTERY SHOULD HAVE 700 COLD CRANKING AMPS BUT WAS REGISTERING 373 (OR SOMEWHERE CLOSE TO THAT) BUT IT WASN'T SHOWING ANYTHING FOR THE ALTERNATOR AFTER TWO TESTS. HUSBAND AND I HAD NOTICED A FUNNY SMELL IN THE ENGINE AFTER WE HAD GOTTEN HOME. WELL, WHEN I LEFT ADVANCE AUTO, THERE WAS A FUNNY BUZZING SOUND, MY INDICATOR WAS SAYING MY SEATBELT WAS UNBUCKLED WHEN IT WASN'T, MY TRACTION CONTROL, ABS BREAK LIGHT, AIRBAG LIGHT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE STARTED COMING ON. THE BUZZING SOUND GOT WORSE SO I PULLED OVER TO A DAYCARE PARKING LOT FROM A WELL TRAVELED ROAD AND JUST AS I DID, THE CAR SHUT OFF AND SEEMED TO LOCK UP. EVERYTHING THAT SHOULD HAVE LIT UP WAS DARK. NO LIGHTS WHATSOEVER INSIDE OR OUT, AUTOMATIC DOOR LOCKS WON'T WORK, ETC. I CAN'T GET THE KEY OUT, I COULDN'T PUT IT IN NEUTRAL, BRAKE PETAL WOULDN'T GO DOWN...NOTHING. TOW TRUCK WAS CALLED TO TAKE MY CAR HOME UNTIL I COULD CONTACT REPAIR SHOP.",
