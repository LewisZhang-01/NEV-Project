I PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND TURNED OFF CAR, THEN TURNED IT BACK ON AND POWER STEERING WORKED. THE NEXT DAY THE SAME THING HAPPENED. I HAD MY CAR TOWED TO A HONDA DEALERSHIP AND THEY TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM. THEY FINALLY GOT IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. FIRST REMOVED A REMOTE STARTER, THOUGHT THAT WOULD FIX IT. I PICKED UP MY CAR AND WHILE DRIVING AT HIGH SPEED ON HIGHWAY IT HAPPENED AGAIN. BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAY THE NEXT THING IS TO REPLACE POWER STEERING COLUMN FOR $2200. THEY ARE NOT EVEN SURE IF THIS WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM. VERY DANGEROUS AND I SEE THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE ALSO REPORTED THIS PROBLEM",
