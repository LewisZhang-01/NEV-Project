        "summary": "THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY IN A LEFT TURN LANE AT A INTERSECTION HAD THE ALTERNATOR LIGHT COME ON. THE JEEP THEN SUDDENLY DIED AND OMITTED A ODOR OF SOMETHING BURNING. THE JEEP WOULD NOT BUDGE AT THAT POINT AND WAS COMPLIANTLY STUCK WITH NO POWER. I COULDN'T EVEN PUSH THE VEHICLE OUT OF THE INTERSECTION BECAUSE THE WHEELS LOCK UP, ALONG WITH EVERYTHING ELSE. LUCKILY IT DID NOT CATCH ON FIRE, BUT I SMELLED SMOKE. I HAD PEOPLE YELLING AND HONKING AT ME BECAUSE I WAS IN THEIR WAY, THEY EVEN YELLED AT THE POLICE OFFICER THERE TO HELP.     THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN TO A LICENSED CHYRSLER DEALER...FROM THERE IT WAS DIAGNOSIS  WITH A  SHORTED OUT ALTERNATOR, WHICH ALSO SHORTED OUT THE COMPUTER AND BATTERY. THE EXTENDED WARRANTY COVERED THE ALTERNATOR AND COMPUTER, BUT THE BATTERY WAS NOT COVERED. THAT IS $247 TO PURCHASE THE BATTERY AND THE $100 EXTENDED INSURANCE DEDUCTIBLE.    THERE IS A RECALL P60 ON THIS YEAR JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE AND DODGE DURANGO, BUT THAT IS THE 160 AMP ALTERNATOR, OURS HAS THE 180 AMP. THE PROBLEM I EXPERIENCED WAS EXACTLY WHAT THE RECALL WAS ISSUED FOR. I BELIEVE MY VEHICLE AND OTHERS NEED TO BE RECALLED BEFORE THEY SHORT OUT AND CATCH ON FIRE.",
