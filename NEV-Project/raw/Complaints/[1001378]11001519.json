LATER I WAS BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE, THEN SWITCHED TO DRIVE IN ATTEMPT TO GO FORWARD.  THE CAR ACCELERATED  W/O MY TOUCHING THE GAS.    I COULDN'T STOP THE CAR AND IT PLOWED INTO SEVERAL OTHER CARS.    I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS HAD HAPPENED.      THE POLICE CAME AND ASSUMED IT WAS MY FAULT BECAUSE AFTER HAVING THIS HAPPEN, I WAS CONFUSED.  THEY TOOK THE CAR TO A BODY SHOP THAT DID THE REPAIRS.   NO ONE MENTIONED THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM W/TOYOTAS.     BY THE TIME I HEARD ABOUT SUDDEN UNINTENDED ACCELERATION (SUA), I CONTACTED TOYOTA.     AS THE INSURANCE COMPANY HAD ALREADY ARRANGED TO HAVE THE CAR FIXED BEFORE I CALLED, THE INVESTIGATOR SAID THEY WOULDN'T EVEN LOOK AT THE CAR AS IT HAD BEEN REPAIRED.     THEN I HAD A 3RD INCIDENT WHERE I'D COME TO A STOP, BUT THE CAR BEGAN TO ACCELERATE.    INITIAL DATE ESTIMATE WAS A GUESSTIMATE FOR MID-OCTOBER ACCELERATION.  11.21.16 WAS THE ACCIDENT, WHICH RESULTED IN OVER $7,000 DAMAGE TO MY CAR AND MORE WAS PAID TOWARDS THE CARS I HIT.  THE MOST RECENT ACCELERATION WAS JANUARY 16, 2017.    TO DATE TOYOTA HAS ON REATTACHED THE CARPETS, SO I AM CONCERNED THIS CAR IS STILL A RISK TO MY LIFE & THAT OF OTHERS.",
