WHEN THE OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE IS ABOVE 88F AND THE \"AUTO\" CLIMATE CONTROL IS SET TO 68C THE DIFFERENCE IN THE TEMPERATURE BETWEEN THE OUTSIDE AIR, AND THE COOLING INSIDE AIR DRAMATICALLY INCREASES THE WEAKNESS AND BRITTLENESS OF THE WINDSHEILD, SUCH THAT WHEN SOMETHING HITS IT, IT ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY CRACKS MORE THAN 7-8 INCHES IN LENGTH. I AM NIW HAVING MY SECOND WINDSHEILD REPLACED IN THE LAST 2 MONTHS BECAUSE OF THIS ISSUE.      BOTH TIMES I WAS DOING ABOUT 70MI/HR ON I-94...I KNOW WINDSHEILDS CRACK WHEN SOMETHING HITS THEM, BUT THIS WAS DIFFERENT THE STRIKE WAS BARELY NOTICEABLE, SOMETHING THAT IF CONDITIONS WERE COOLER OR THE TEMPERATURE EQUALIZED, I DONT THINK THE THERMODYNAMICS WOULD BE RIGHT FOR.  THANKS,  CHRIS",
