        "summary": "ON JULY 8, 2017 WE HAD JUST PURCHASED A NEW 2017 TUNDRA.  WE TOW A 24 FT. RV TRAILER AND WE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE FOR THAT REASON.  ONE OF THE FEATURES THIS VEHICLE HAS IS THE INTEGRATED BRAKE CONTROL SYSTEM FOR TOWING.  AS WE WERE HEADED HOME ON STATE HWY. 42 NEAR COOS BAY, OREGON, I NOTICED BLUE SMOKE COMING FROM THE REAR OF THE PICKUP.  I WASN'T SURE WHAT HAPPENED.  I STOPPED AS SOON AS I COULD AND I COULDN'T LOCATE THE CAUSE OF THE SMOKE.  I LATER LEARNED THERE HAS BEEN MANY CONSUMER COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE FAULTINESS OF THIS INTEGRATED BRAKE SYSTEM CONTROLLER.  I WANT THIS ISSUE FIXED SO I CAN BE ASSURED OF A SAFE TRIP WHEN TOWING MY RV TRAILER WITHOUT THE FEAR OF HAVING NO TRAILER BRAKES WHEN I NEED THEM OR HAVING THEM LOCK UP FOR NO REASON.  THANK YOU",
