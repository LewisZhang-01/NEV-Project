ALL ELECTONICS IN VEHICLE WENT BLANK, INCLUDING ALL CONTROLS/GAUGES. BEFORE DOING SO, LAST CODE READ, SHIFT TO PARK. ALMOST CAUSED ME TO HAVE AN ACCIDENT, BECAUSE THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT AND NEARLY PULLED ME INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE. THE ACCELERATION IS BAD TOO, FEELS LIKE IT IS NOT FIRING ALL CYLINDERS AGAIN. HAVE ALREADY TAKEN IN FOR A NUMBER OF ISSUES, INCLUDING CRANKSHAFT SENSOR ISSUES(WAS LOSING POWER TO DRIVELINE); BRAKES LOCKING UP (HAVE REPLACED THE ROTORS AND PADS SIX TIMES AND LAST TIME I REPLACED BOTH CALIBERS AS WELL; FRONT AXLES AND BEARINGS REPLACED. AS WELL AS, BLINKERS NO LONGER WORK. WHEN THE FIRST ISSUES AROSE,  PROBLEMS HAVE CONTINUED SINCE, LIKE I SAID HAVE TAKEN IT IN AT LEAST 6 TIMES TO A DEALER AND ONCE TO AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC. AT FIRST THE PROBLEMS WERE COVERED BY WARRENTY, NOW THEY ARE NOT, THERE IS ONLY 99,000MILES ON THE TRUCK AND HAS BEEN IN SHOP AT LEAST 6 TIMES AND IS ONLY 4 YRS OLD. NOT SURE WHAT TO DO, AS THE PROBLEMS RESEMBLE RECALL ISSUES, BUT DEALERSHIP SAYS THEY AREN'T PART OF ANY RECALLS. CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY ON THE ROAD. THE TRUCK IS NOW NOT DRIVEABLE!!!",
