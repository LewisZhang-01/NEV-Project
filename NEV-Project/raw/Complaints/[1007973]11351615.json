FIRST, WE REFILLED THE COOLANT, AND WHEN IT HAPPENED THE 2ND TIMES AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME OF 1-2 MONTHS, WE REFILLED IT ONCE AGAIN, ONCE THE COOLANT TANK WAS EMPTY, BUT ONLY THIS TIME, IT'S A SHORT PERIOD OF 2 DAYS.  TOOK THE TRUCK TO THE CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP, WAS TOLD BY THE MECHANIC THAT IT'S A RECALL ITEM, THAT IT HAD BEEN REPORTED SOME OF THE RAM 1500 HAD MYSTERIOUS COOLANT LEAKED.  THEY HAD NO IDEA WHERE THE COOLANT GO, THEY SAID IT'S NOT \"SAFE\" TO DRIVE THE TRUCK.  NOW MY TRUCK HAD BEEN IN THE SHOP FOR 1.5 MONTHS AND WAS TILL BEING TOLD THAT THE PART HAD NOT ARRIVED.  WE NEVER RECEIVED ANY RECALL WARNING FROM CHRYSLER.  LUCKILY THE COOLANT WARNING SIGN IS WORKING.  OTHERWISE, WE WON'T BE ABLE TO KNOW AND WE AS WELL AS OTHER DRIVERS ON THE STREET MIGHT BE EXPOSED TO EXPLOSION.",
