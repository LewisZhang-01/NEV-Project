SHE BARELY MADE IT TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.  SINCE WE HAD TO GET TO AN EXIT I TOOK OVER.  THE STEERING TAKES A LOT OF MUSCLE TO TURN THE VEHICLE BECAUSE OF THE SMALL STEERING WHEEL.  I AM GLAD I WAS WITH HER.  I RESEARCHED AND FOUND HONDA HAD A BIG PROBLEM WITH THIS IN 2013.  THEY GAVE AN EXTENDED WARRANTY OF 100,000 MILES TO THESE VEHICLES. I EXPECT THE SAME WARRANTY EXTENSION.  I HAVE OWNED HONDAS SINCE 1977 AND MANY I HAVE DRIVEN WELL BEYOND 190,000 MILES WITHOUT A PROBLEM LIKE THIS.",
