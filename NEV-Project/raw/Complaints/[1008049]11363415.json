        "summary": "ON AUG 19TH MY CAR WENT IN FOR SERVICE DUE TO THE UNSAFE FAILURES OF ITEMS REPLACED DURING THE 2 RECALLS. THE AUTOMATIC TRANSAXLE GEAR SHIFT MODULE AND  POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE WERE BOTH RECALLED AND \"FIXED\". YET ON OCOTOBER 7TH 2020, I EXPERIENCED THE INABILITY TO SHIFT AND CONTROL THE TRANSMISSION GEAR SELECTION. I HAD UNINTENDED DIRECTIONAL MOVEMENT. I EXPERIENCED A DIMINISHED ABILITY TO ACCELERATE AND TO MAINTAIN VEHICLE SPEED AS EXPECTED. I WAS ONLY GOING 20MPH-40MPH ON STREETS. THE CAR WAS SWITCHING GEARS ON ITS ON AND STALLING IN TRAFFIC. WHEN I WOULD PUSH ON GAS PEDDLE IT WAS ROLLING BACK WHILE ON AN INCLINE. WHAT WAS MOST ALARMING WAS THAT AS I TRIED TO GET THE CAR HOME IT WOULD NOT ACCELERATE AS I PULLED OUT INTO TRAFFIC. I ATTEMPTED TO PUT THE CAR INTO REVERSE TO GET IT INTO MY DRIVEWAY AND IT WOULD NOT GO INTO REVERSE. OBVIOUSLY THE RECALLS IN BOTH 2014 & 2017 FAILED TO RECTIFY THE PROBLEM. THE CAR HAS ONLY BEEN  DRIVEN PER AUG 19TH'S SERVICE RECOMMENDATIONS, AVOIDING AGGRESSIVE HIGH SPEEDS AND WHEN IDLE PUT IN PARK TO AVOID OVER HEATING. I HAVE DRIVEN IT AN AVERAGE OF 18MILES A DAY SINCE LAST SERVICED. EVERYTHING I AM EXPERIENCING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE TWO RECALLS. UNSAFE CAR.",
