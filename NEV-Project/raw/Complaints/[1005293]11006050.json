AFTER  STOPPING, I PRESSED ON THE BRAKES AND PUSHED THE START BUTTON AND THE CAR STARTED RIGHT UP AND I DROVE HOME, NO FURTHER PROBLEMS. THIS WAS ON A LAS VEGAS CITY STREET. THIS IS THE 6TH TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED IN LESS THAN A YEAR, TWICE IT WAS ON THE FREEWAY! WE JUST PICKED UP THE CAR FROM THE DEALERSHIP ON FRIDAY, TODAY IS MONDAY, THEY CLAIMED THAT THEY COULDN'T DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM, BUT DIDN'T KNOW THAT I HAD DOCUMENTED THE MILEAGE AND THEY DID NOT EVEN TEST DRIVE THE VEHICLE!",
