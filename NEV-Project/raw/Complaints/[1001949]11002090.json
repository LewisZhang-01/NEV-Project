CAR HAS ZERO ACCIDENT AND THERE IS NO RUST OR SIGNS OF ANY OTHER FACTOR THAT MAY HAD AFFECTED THE STRUCTURE. THIS CRACKS ARE A THREAT TO THE DRIVER'S SAFETY BECAUSE THE STRUT MAY PERFORATE THE BODY/FRAME OF THE CAR AND HIT THE WINDSHIELD WHILE ON THE ROAD. THIS CRACKS ARE VERY HARD TO FIND DUE TO THE LOCATION WERE ARE DEVELOPED, AND THERE ARE NOT OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY WARN THE DRIVER ABOUT THE ISSUE. THIS METAL FATIGUE CRACKS LOOK EXACTLY AS THE DESCRIBED BY MULTIPLE OWNERS ON THE REAR OF THE CAR. THE BIG DIFFERENCE, IS THAT THE CRACKS ON THE REAR OF THE CAR ONLY CAUSE WATER TO LEAK INTO THE TRUNK, WITH IS NOT A BIG SAFETY CONCERN. HONDA STATED THAT BECAUSE THE CAR IS ALREADY OUT OF WARRANTY THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT.",
