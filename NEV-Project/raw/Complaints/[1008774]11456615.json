        "summary": "We were driving on I-8 yesterday from California to Arizona and while using cruise control the car kept phantom braking.  It happened multiple times - some times the braking was so hard, it threw us and our children forward in their car seats.  It was terrifying and almost caused us to get into multiple accidents.   There was absolutely no reason for the car to be braking . We tried to notice a pattern.   It almost seemed like the car was afraid of its own shadow in front of us (the setting sun was directly behind us at points). But the phantom braking also happened when there was no shadow and nothing at all around.  Absolutely terrifying.",
