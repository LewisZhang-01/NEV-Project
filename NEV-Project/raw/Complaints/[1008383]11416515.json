THEY SAID THERE WERE UNABLE TO REPAIR THE ISSUE CAUSE VOLKSWAGEN DISCONTINUED THE PART. SO THEY SAID TO ME THAT ECS TUNING HAS THE PART AVAILABLE AND THEY COULD INSTALL IT FOR $537 EXTRA. I THOUGHT THE AIRBAG SYSTEM WAS SUPPOSE TO BE FREE OF ERRORS FOR THE LIFETIME OF THE VEHICLE SO WHY DO I PUT MYSELF AND OCCUPANTS IN DANGER DRIVING WITH A MALFUNCTIONING MANUFACTURE PART? I HOPE THERE IS SOME REMEDY FOR THIS AND I AM NOT PAYING ALMOST ANOTHER $1000 FOR THIS LIGHT TO BE TURNED OFF. HOPE VOLKSWAGEN GETS THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND MIND THEIR CUSTOMERS SAFETY OF THEIR VEHICLES. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE! HOPE THIS GETS TO VOLKSWAGEN AND NHTSA DOES SOMETHING ABOUT THIS!",
