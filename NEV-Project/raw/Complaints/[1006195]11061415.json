IMMEDIATELY IT FLASHED A WARNING THAT THE \"HILL CLIMB ASSIST\" MALFUNCTIONED FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY A WRENCH SYMBOL NOTIFYING THAT SERVICE WAS NEEDED THEN ANOTHER WARNING ABOUT THE ADVANCE TRAC SYSTEM THEN BACK TO THE HILL CLIMB ASSIST SYMBOL. ALL OF THIS HAPPENING WHILE THE CAR BEHIND ME IS ALMOST SIDEWAYS TRYING TO AVOID ME. I EVENTUALLY MADE IT TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER OF THE HIGHWAY.  AS I READ THE VARIOUS WARNINGS IT SAID TO REFER TO THE OWNERS MANUAL WITH REGARDS TO THE HILL CLIMB ASSIST. I TURNED THE IGNITION OFF, PULLED OUT THE OWNERS MANUAL ONLY TO FIND A DESCRIPTION OF THE HILL CLIMB ASSIST FEATURE. AFTER WAITING FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES I DECIDED TO TURN ON THE IGNITION.  THE TRUCK STARTED WITHOUT ISSUE AND I CONTINUED HOME CAUTIOUSLY IN THE FAR RIGHT LANE.",
