THE CAR WAS STATIONARY AND PARKED IN THE GARAGE SINCE APRX 7:00 PM MONDAY EVENING THE 17TH. HEARING A NOISE IN THE GARAGE, I WENT THERE AND FOUND THE CARD ENGINE RUNNING. THE GARAGE DOOR WAS CLOSED, AND NO ONE COULD HAVE ENTERED THE GARAGE. WE ARE TAKING THE CAR TO PLACE OF PURCHASE, KLICK LEWIS BUICK CHEV, PALMYRA, PA TO DETERMINE WHAT THEY WILL DO TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. CHECKED RECALL AND FOUND NOTHING. SINCE THIS SELF STARTING COULD POSSIBLY CAUSE OTHER DAMAGE INCLUDING CARBON MONOXIDE IN A CLOSED AREA (DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD HAVE SHUT OFF AFTER A SET SHORT TIME ON ITS OWN) THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE REPORTED AND A NOTICE SENT OUT TO ALL ENCORE OWNERS WARNING THEM OF THIS ISSUE.
