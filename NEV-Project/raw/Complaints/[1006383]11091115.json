THE CAR BEGAN RUNNING VERY ROUGHLY ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO, I DID AN OIL CHANGE. A MONTH LATER THE CAR WAS OVER 2 QUARTS LOW ON OIL, WHERE THE OIL WENT I HAVE NO IDEA. THE CAR HAS BEEN IN THE DEALERSHIP OVER AND OVER AND OVER FOR VARIOUS ELECTRICAL, MECHANICAL AND ENGINE ISSUES. I HAVE ALL DOCUMENTATION AND FEEL THE CAR IS A SAFETY HAZARD. WHY IS HYUNDAI PERFORMING THE INSPECTIONS ON THESE CARS WHEN CLEARLY THEY ARE THE ONES RESPONSIBLE. THE INPSECTIONS SHOULD BE DONE BY INDEPENDENT MECHANICS THAT WILL BE NON BIASED. MY CAR DOESN'T HAVE BRAKE LIGHTS THAT OPERATE CORRECTLY EITHER THEY WORK SOMETIMES OR NOT AT ALL. IT JUST DEPENDS ON THE CONNECTIVITY OF THE ELECTRICAL WIRING AT THE TIME, I AM TOTALLY NOT SURE. THE CAR JUST BEGAN BEING ABLE TO START WITHOUT PRESSING THE BRAKE PEDAL. THIS JUST STARTED AND THE STOP PAD FOR THE BRAKE RECALL HAS ALREADY BEEN PERFORMED. IT ISN'T JUST A STOP PAD ISSUE. THE ENTIRE CAR IS AN ELECTRICAL HAZARD WAITING TO HAPPEN I JUST PRAY I AM NOT IN MY CAR WHEN IT CATCHES FIRE AND NO ONE ELSE IS CAUSED ANY ACCIDENT OR INJURY AS A RESULT OF IT.",
