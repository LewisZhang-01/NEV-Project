        "summary": "LOST POWER STEARING A YEAR AGO DASH WARNING READS POWER STEARING ASSIST FAULT. AT THE SAME TIME MY HEATER BLOWER STOPPED WORKING.  MY MECHANIC WAS ABLE TO RESET THE FAULT AND STEERING WOULD COME BACK BUT USUALLY FOR A DAY OR TWO. IT WOULD FAULT OUT DURING THIS TIME BUT I COULD SHUT OFF AND RESTART THE TRUCK AND IT WOULD RESET THE FAULT BUT ON THE FOURTH ATTEMPT AT THIS WOULD NOT RESET THE  FAULT . THIS WENT ON FOR A MONTH OR SO AS WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM. THEN ONE DAY IT WOULD NO LONGER RESET AT ALL. SO I HAD THE STEERING RACK REPLACED. LAST APRIL. LESS THEN 5000 KM LATER IN SEPTEMBER THE STEERING FAULT HAPPENED AGAIN ALONG WITH TRACTION CONTROL FAULT  AND DISINGRATED THE FRONT PASSENGERS SIDE BRAKE. AND THE HEATER BLOWER MOTOR WENT AGAIN. THESE RACKS AND THE LABOUR INTENSIVE REPLACEMENT ALONG WITH THE COST OF THE OTHER FIXES IS ASTRONOMICAL.  I AM ABOUT TOO INSTALL THE THIRD RACK.WITH NO CONFIDENCE AT ALL THAT I WILL NOT BE BACK TOO SQUARE ONE IN SEPT AGAIN. THE SAYING GOES THE DIFFINITION OF INSANITY IS REPEATING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND EXPECTING A DIFFERENT RESULT. SO SHE GOES FOR SALE WHEN FIXED. THE VEHICLE WAS ALWAYS IN MOTION WHEN FAULT OCCURRED.",
