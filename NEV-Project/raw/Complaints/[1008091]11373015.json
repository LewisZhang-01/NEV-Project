MULTIPLE LIGHTS FLASHED ON THE DASH. I COASTED TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD.  AFTER I STOPPED, ALL THE LIGHTS ON THE DASH HAD GONE OUT BUT THE ENGINE WAS STILL RUNNING. IT RESPONDED NORMALLY AFTER THAT.  DEALERSHIP SAID A COMMUNICATION CODE SHOWED BUT WAS NOT RELATED TO MY ISSUE. I HAD THREE OTHER \"LOSS OF POWER INCIDENTS\" SINCE ALL AT LOW SPEED, EITHER STARTING FROM A STOP OR ATTEMPTING ACCELERATION AFTER A TURN.  THE YELLOW TRIANGLE FLASHED THOSE TIMES BUT TRAFFIC DID NOT ALLOW ME TO KEEP PUSHING ON ACCELERATOR.  AFTER A SHORT COAST POWER RETURNED. DEALERSHIP REPORTED NO CODE.  EXPERIENCE SIMILAR TO DESCRIPTION OF BEHAVIOR OF VEHICLES IN TOYOTA FUEL PUMP RECALL.  I BELIEVE IT IS THE FUEL PUMP.  DEALERSHIP AND TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE TELL ME I MUST DRIVE IT UNTIL IT \"FAILS\" AND SHOWS A CODE.  SAFETY ISSUE, ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN.",
