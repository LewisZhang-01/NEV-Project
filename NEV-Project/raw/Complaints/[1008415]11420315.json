Due to this I have lost any control to these settings since the cracked screen has caused the touchscreen to not even work and there is no response when you tap the screen. Have reached out to Cadillac and they say it\u2019s not their problem but the screen was not cracked in any kind of accident it was cracked due to the way Cadillac built the screen and the type of materials used to build the screen. Multiple people have had the same issue and Cadillac refuses to recall the touchscreen on these vehicles.",
