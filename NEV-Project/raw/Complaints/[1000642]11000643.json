I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED AND THE TRANSMISSION REBUILT. THIS TRANSMISSION IS NOW SLIPPING AT 134000 MILES AND IS PAST THE WARRANTY TIME AND NEEDS TO BE REPAIRED. THIS IS A DANGEROUS HAZARD AS WHEN THE CAR IS WARM IT WON'T MOVE. THIS IS EVIDENTLY A COMMON DEFECT WITH THIS PRODUCT AND I WANT TO KNOW IF I CAN SUE FORD FOR THIS OBVIOUS DESIGN DEFECT WHICH HAS AFFECTED MANY FORD FREESTAR OWNERS.",
