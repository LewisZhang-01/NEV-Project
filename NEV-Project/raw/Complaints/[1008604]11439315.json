The contact immediately shut off the engine and all the occupants evacuated the vehicle. The motorist behind her witnessed what had happened and assisted with unhooking the battery cable as a small fire began to erupt on the passenger side floor mats. The motorist's wife was able to retrieve a fire extinguisher from a person's home and extinguish the fire. The authorities were not called to the scene. No injuries were reported and a police report was not filed. Due to the failure, the vehicle was initially towed to an independent mechanic who could not repair the vehicle and recommended the vehicle be towed to a dealer; the vehicle was then towed to her home. The manufacturer was notified of the failure but offered no assistance. The vehicle had yet to be repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 110,000.",
