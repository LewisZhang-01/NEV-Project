TOOK OUR CAR INTO THE LOCAL GARAGE AND THEY TOLD US THERE WAS A LEAK ON THE TOP OF THE MOTOR. WE PLANNED ON FIXING THIS THE FOLLOWING PAYDAY, BUT INSTEAD LEFT THE DEALERSHIP TO A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL AND THAT WAS IT THE CAR NEVER MOVED AGAIN. THE RODS WERE SHOT AND CAUSED MOTOR TO SEIZE. OUR LOCAL GARAGE, BENDING WRENCHES BELIEVES THERE IS EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT OUR CLAIM. WE HAVE PAID FOR A NEW ENGINE TO BE PLACED IN VEHICLE AND ARE HOPING TO BECOME A PART OF THIS RECALL AND BE REIMBURSED FOR THIS MANUFACTURER DEFECT. WE HAVE ALL PAPERWORK FROM GARAGE AND ALSO KEPT THE OIL THAT HAD BEEN CHANGED FROM THE KIA SHOWING THAT THERE IS PROBABLY LITTLE FLEKS OF THE METAL FROM THE RODS IN THIS OIL WHICH CAUSED IT TO BECOME LUMPY. NOT SURE WHERE ELSE TO TURN FOR HELP WITH THIS CLAIM.",
