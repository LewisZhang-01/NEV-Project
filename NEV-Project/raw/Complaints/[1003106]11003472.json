JEEP SLOWED SLIGHTLY FOR A BRIEF MOMENT, THEN SUDDENLY AND POWERFULLY ACCELERATED APPROX. 3 FEET FORWARD INTO THE BUILDING WHILE MY FOOT REMAINED FIRMLY ON THE BRAKE, CAUSING DAMAGE TO BOTH VEHICLE AND STOREFRONT. A DANGEROUS DESIGN FLAW, THIS IS THE 2ND TIME THE ACCELLERATION PROBLEM IT HAS OCCURRED (LOCAL AUTHORIZED DEALER THOUGHT IT WAS FIXED). I'VE SINCE FOUND MANY INSTANCES ONLINE WITH OTHER JEEP OWNERS EXPERIENCING THE SAME EXACT THING - SOME OF WHICH RESULTED IN FATALITIES. THE CAUSE OF THIS ACCIDENT WAS TOTAL BRAKE FAILURE, AND SUDDEN UNINTENDED ACCELLERATION (SUA) - AN ISSUE WHICH FORMER CONNECTICUT ATTORNEY GENERAL (AND CURRENT SENATOR) HAS URGED GENERAL MOTORS TO ADDRESS ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS.",
