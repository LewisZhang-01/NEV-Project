THEY CHANGED THE COILS OUT, THEY CHANGED THE TIMING CHAIN, THEY REPLACED OIL PAN GASKETS, AND HEAD GASKETS, AND THEY REPLACED GASKET AROUND THE OIL FILTER.  ALL ENGINE RELATED ITEMS.  I HAVE HEARD THERE ARE BMW ENGINES THAT BUILD UP TOO MUCH PRESSURE IN THEM WHICH CAUSES THEM TO BLOW UP.  WITH ALL THE ITEMS THAT I HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH ON THIS CAR AND NOW THE ENGINE BLEW UP WITH 79,000 MILES ON IT, I AM VERY UPSET.  THE EXTENDED WARRANTY WAS FOR AN ADDITIONAL 50K MILES AND 2 YEARS FROM ORIGINAL WARRANTY.  THE ENGINE BLOWS MONTHS AFTER THE 6 YEARS RUNS OUT.  THIS ENGINE FAILED BECAUSE OF BMW QUALITY AND DESIGN NOT MY DRIVING.  BMW NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION AND REIMBURSE ME FOR THE REPLACEMENT ENGINE.  I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED WHEN THE CAR LOST POWER GOING DOWN THE HIGHWAY.",
