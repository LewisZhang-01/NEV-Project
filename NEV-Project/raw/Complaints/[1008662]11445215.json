        "summary": "Was driving my car and got a message about steering assist came on.  Shut the car off because I could not steer it, turned car back on and message went away and it was ok.  Had an appointment 12/14 to have my car inspected and an oil change at Carnegie Motors so I told them what happened .  I had to get a new tire to pass inspection so had to wait for tht to come in 12/20/21They did their part but called and said it would have to go to the dealership for the steering problem they had removed the battery thinking it would reset itself.  Jeff then took it up to Woltz Wind Ford which was about 1 mile up the road - had trouble steering.  Because of the holiday and days off they did not get to my car till 12/27 they told me that the Steering Gear box had to be replaced.  In researching online I saw that Ford had recalls on 20008 and 2011 for the same problem.  My vehicle has41,958 miles on it.  Apparently Ford still has the same problem with steering issues  The representative just said that parts wear out that I did nothing to cause this problem.  I have to get this car repaired to the tune of $2200 plus it is still there will send invoice when I get it.  Just glad I was not on the highway when this happened.  Definitely a safety issue   Obviously the 2013 needed to be recalled as well.",
