NOW the passenger seatbelt will not retract - there should be recalls for my vehicle as I have seen where other Dodge Durango\u2019s had recalls for the same issue.     I cannot transport anyone in my passenger seat until it is fixed.   Highly disappointed - we have a Dodge Durango - Chrysler Van and Dodge Ram - we give our business to these brands and the seatbelts are not under recall when they are failing to restrain people.    This should be covered under recall!",
