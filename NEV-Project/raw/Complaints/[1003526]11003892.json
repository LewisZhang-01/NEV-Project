MICHELIN PRIMACY MXV4 (NOT A CHEAP TIRE) HAD A LITTLE OVER 40K MILES BEFORE THEY NEEDED TO BE REPLACED. REPLACED WITH CONTINENTAL TRUE CONTACT (90,000 MILE TIRE) AND I HAVE DRIVEN ABOUT 45K MILES ON THEM AND THEY ARE ONCE AGAIN IN NEED OF REPLACEMENT. I ROTATE TIRES AT THE DEALERSHIP ON A REGULAR BASIS AS WELL AS KEEP THEM INFLATED AT THE RECOMMENDED INFLATION. VEHICLE HAS ALSO HAD REGULAR ALIGNMENT CHECKS AND PERFORMED ALIGNMENTS. IN READING MULTIPLE FORUMS, THIS SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE WITH THE TOYOTA SIENNA THAT TOYOTA REFUSES TO CORRECT, NOT A TIRE MANUFACTURER PROBLEM.",
