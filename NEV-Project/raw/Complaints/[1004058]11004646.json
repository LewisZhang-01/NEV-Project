DIAGNOSED AS THE REAR DIFFERENTIAL EVEN THOUGH IT WASNT LEAKING. TWO WEEKS LATER THEY ARE TELLING ME IT'S GOING TO TAKE A MONTH OR MORE TO GET THE PART. I AM IN A LOANER CAR AND CAN'T SEEM TO GET A SOLID ANSWER ON WHATS GOING ON WITH THESE REAR DIFFS. I DON'T EVEN WANT THE TRUCK AT THIS POINT SINCE THEY CAN'T EVEN FIX IT.",
