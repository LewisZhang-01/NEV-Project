IT WOULD NOT CLOSE OR OPEN MANUALLY NO MATTER WHAT I DID. I HAD TO DRIVE MYSELF AND 5 KIDS ACROSS TOWN WITH THE DOOR OPEN, CAR BEEPING BECAUSE DOOR WAS OPEN. MY HUSBAND FINALLY GOT THE DOOR TO CLOSE AFTER I GOT HOME BUT THERE WAS A SEVERED CABLE THAT NOW HANGS UNDER THE REAR WINDOW. THE DOOR WILL NOT OPEN MANUALLY OR  AUTOMATICALLY NOW. SO I CAN'T USE THE DOOR AT ALL. IF YOU EVEN TRY TO TOUCH OR OPEN THE DOOR THEN THE SYSTEM THINKS THE DOOR IS OPEN AND BEEPS THE WHOLE TIME YOU ARE DRIVING AND YOU CAN'T LOCK THE DOOR. I'M WORRIED IT WILL OPEN WHILE DRIVING. FROM RESEARCH IT APPEARS TO BE AN ALL TOO COMMON ISSUE WITH TOYOTA VANS AND SHOULD BE A RECALL OR COVERED FOR THE LIFE OF THE VEHICLE IN MY OPINION. THE AUTO OPENING DOOR WAS THE ONLY REASON WE PURCHASED A VAN AND NOT A SUV.",
