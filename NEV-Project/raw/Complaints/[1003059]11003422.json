WHEN ORDERING THE REPLACEMENT PART I NOTICED IT APPLIED TO SOME OF THE CARS COVERED UNDER THE RECALL AND SOME THAT WERE NOT.  IT SEEMS TO MY THAT MY FORRESTER HAD PRECISELY THE SAME LINES THAT WERE RECALLED ON OTHER MODELS AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN YOU ORIGINAL SETTLEMENT WITH SUBARU.  WE HAVE MANY OLDER CARS IN THE FAMILY AND NOT ONE OF THEM HAS EVER EXPERIENCED A BRAKE LINE FAILURE DUE TO CORROSION.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SUBARU IS NEGLIGENT IN SUPPLYING CARS WITH BRAKE LINES THAT CORRODE MORE EASILY FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT AUDI, TOYOTA, LEXUS AND HONDA - JUST FROM OUR EXPERIENCE.",
