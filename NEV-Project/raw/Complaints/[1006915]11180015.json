        "summary": "DEATH WOBBLE - AT ABOUT 55-60 MILES PER HOUR WITH AN EMPTY TRUCK, I EXPERIENCED THE DEATH WOBBLE ON THE FREEWAY. MY TRUCK SEEMED TO GO OVER A VERY SLIGHT POTHOLE IN THE ROAD AND BEGAN THIS JUMPING. THE FREEWAY WAS CROWDED AND I WAS IN LANE#3. THE TRUCK SWERVED VIOLENTLY. I HAD TO SLAM ON MY BRAKES AND GET TO THE SHOULDER. THE DEATH WOBBLE DID NOT STOP UNTIL I SLOWED TO ABOUT 15 MILES PER HOUR. I WAS UNABLE TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE.   THE PROBLEM HAPPENED ONCE MORE THE SAME DAY. IT TOOK FORD A WEEK TO GET AN APPOINTMENT. ONCE THE VEHICLE WAS SEEN THEY ONLY REPLACED THE STEERING DAMPER WITH THE SAME TYPE AND DID A FRONT END ALIGNMENT. TRUCK STILL WANTS TO JUMP AROUND ON ROAD SURFACES AND I FEEL THE DEATH WOBBLE COULD HAPPEN AT ANY MOMENT.    THE SERVICE MANAGER ACTED LIKE THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD HEARD OF THIS ISSUE, UNTIL I DID A GOOGLE SEARCH AND FOUND MANY DISCUSSIONS AND COMPLAINTS ABOUT OTHER 2017 SUPER DUTY TRUCKS DOING THE SAME THING. THEN THEY ADMITTED TO SEEING IT ON OTHER VEHICLES. I FELT LIKE I WAS GOING TO CRASH AT ANY MOMENT.",
