I HAD STOPPED AT THE RED LIGHT AND NOTICED SMOKE COMING FROM UNDER THE HOOD SO I PULLED OVER AND LIFTED THE HOOD. THE SMOKE WAS COMING FROM THE DRIVERS SIDE AND WHEN I LOOKED IN THAT DIRECTION I SAW THAT MY HEAD LAMP HAD FIRE COMING FROM IT. I PLACED WATER ON IT TO PUT OUT THE FIRE AND THERE WAS A LOUD POP THAT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED THAT SOUNDED LIKE A GUN WENT OFF. I WAITED FOR MY EARDRUMS TO CALM DOWN AND WAITED TO MAKE SURE NO ADDITIONAL FIRE OR SMOKE WAS COMING FROM THE CAR BEFORE APPROACHING IT.",
