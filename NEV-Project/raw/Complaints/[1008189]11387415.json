GOT ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE FOR JUMP START, CAR STARTED BUT COULD NOT PUT IN REVERSE, DRIVE, OR NEUTRAL.  DASH PANEL WAS LIT UP WITH MULTIPLE WARNINGS INDICATED.  THIS HAPPENED ON A SUNDAY SO HAD TO HAVE VEHICLE TOWED TO MY RESIDENCE A MILE AWAY BECAUSE DEALERSHIP WHERE I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE WAS NOT OPENED FOR ME TO TOW THERE. DISGUSTINGLY I DID NOT MAKE A FULL MONTH FROM DELIVERY DATE BEFORE THIS HAPPENED.  I WAS FORCED TO TOW THE VEHICLE TO MY RESIDENCE A MILE AWAY, DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE OVERNIGHT IN THE PARKING LOT FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.  IN FACT, COULD NOT EVEN LOCK THE VEHICLE. HAVING THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP TOMORROW TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. HOPEFULLY GET A PERMANENT FIX. UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE UNCOVERED MULTIPLE INSTANCES ON THE INTERNET DESCRIBING THIS VERY SAME ISSUE THAT HAD I KNOWN PRIOR TO MAKING THE PURCHASE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN STRONG CONSIDERATIONS TO \"NOT\" BUYING THIS VEHICLE.",
