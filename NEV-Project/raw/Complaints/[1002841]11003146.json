I HAD THE FRAME INSPECTION RECALL PERFORMED IN 2012 AND WAS TOLD THE FRAME IS OK SO THEY COATED THE FRAME WITH UNDER COATING. A FEW MONTHS LATER I WAS DRIVING TO WORK AND HIT A JOINT ON THE HIGHWAY AND ENDED UP IN THE NEXT LANE. AS I AM IN THE BUSINESS I PUT THE VEHICLE IN THE AIR THAT EVENING AND FOUND THE STEERING RACK MOUNT WAS DETACHED FROM THE FRAME DUE TO RUST. I THEN SPOKE TO TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND EXPLAINED THE SITUATION AND I WAS TOLD TO BRING THE VEHICLE BACK IN AND THEY WOULD LOOK AT IT. I WAS TOLD AGAIN THE FRAME IS OK.. I DID EXPLAIN TO THE DEALER THAT I HAD TO WLD A STEEL PLATE TO THE FRAME SO THE VEHICLE WOULD BE SAFE TO DRIVE.   THEY STILL SAID THE FRAME IS OK AND THEY WOULD RE SPRAY THE FRAME AS A GESTURE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. I HAVE MADE NUMEROUS CALLS AND EMAILS TO TOYOTA SINCE THEN BECAUSE JUNE OF 2016 I FOUND RUST HOLES IN THE FRAME IN 2 DIFFERENT SPOTS..   THERE IS A RECALL TO REPLACE THE FRAME IF THERE ARE PERFORATIONS IN THE FRAME DURING THE INSPECTION. HOWEVER I HAVE BEEN TOLD SEVERAL TIMES THEY WILL NOT ASSIST ME ANY FURTHER ON THIS SITUATION.  THANK YOU   [XXX]  [XXX] *DL",
