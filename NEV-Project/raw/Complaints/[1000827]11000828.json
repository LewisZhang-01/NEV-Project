THIS IS AN OPTION THAT I BOUGHT AS A SAFETY DEVICE OR SOMETHING  TO ASSIST IN MY SAFE DRIVING.  I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALER AND THE TECH SAID THAT PER THE GM TECHNICAL DOCUMENT THAT IT WORKED AS IT SHOULD, EVEN THOUGH THE SERVICE ADVISOR AND THE TECH AGREED THAT IT DIDN'T WORK AT ALL. I HAVE A COPY OF THE SERVICE MANUAL DOCUMENT, NUMBER 3819903,  AND MINE DOESN'T PERFORM AT ALL LIKE THE DOCUMENT SAYS IT SHOULD. I BOUGHT THIS CAR IN PART BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY FEATURE, AS IT STATES ON THE NEW CAR STICKER.",
