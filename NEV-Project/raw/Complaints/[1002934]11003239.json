TESTING, MY HIGH BEAMS WORKED, BUT MY LOWS WERE OFF.  I TURNED THE CAR OFF AND WAITED A FEW MINUTES.  ONCE TURNED BACK ON, MY LIGHTS WORKED.  THIS THE FIRST TIME THIS HAPPENED, THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES AND THERE IS NO RHYME OR REASON AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN.  I HAVE SEEN THIS SAME ISSUE WITH A YEAR EARLIER AND WONDER IF THE PROBLEM EXTENDS TO NEWER MODELS. THIS RECALL SHOULD BE EXTENDED TO 2008 AS IT APPEARS MY VEHICLE IS HAVING THE SAME ISSUES.   I HAVE HAD DIAGNOSTICS AND REPLACED HEADLAMPS...THE PROBLEM PERSISTS.",
