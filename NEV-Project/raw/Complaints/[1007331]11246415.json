AFTER READING MANY ONLINE FORUMS, THERE ARE MANY OTHER '09 LS OWNERS EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM.   WE HAVE BROUGHT OUR CAR TO THE LEXUS DEALERSHIP A FEW TIMES AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROPERLY FIX OR EVEN DIAGNOSE THE CAUSE. THERE ARE NO LIGHTS ON THE DASHBOARD INDICATING WHERE THE PROBLEM LIES. ALL WE HAVE BEEN TOLD IS THAT IT'S IN THE KNOCK SENSOR. WE HAVE ONLY BEEN TOLD THAT LEXUS HAS DESIGNED THE KNOCK SENSOR IN SUCH A WAY THAT A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT OR CODE WILL NOT BE GIVEN. THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR US AS THE CUSTOMER. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A URGENT RECALL PROBLEM THAT LEXUS MUST OWN AND REPAIR. THIS IS A MAYOR SAFETY HAZARD THAT HAS POTENTIAL TO PUT THE LIVES OF MY FAMILY OR OTHERS AT STAKE.",
