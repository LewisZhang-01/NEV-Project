        "summary": "VEHICLE WAS PARKED AT WORK. I GOT OFF WORK CAME TO VEHICLE ENTERED AND STARTED ENGINE AFTER ABOUT 1 MINUTE, A BUZZING SOUND CAME FROM UNDER THE DASH, THEN I BEGAN TO SMELL SMOKE LIKE BURNING WIRES OR SOMETHING ELECTRICAL UNDER THE DASH. THEN I SAW SMOKE COMING FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT (UNDER THE VEHICLES FRONT HOOD). BY THIS TIME ABOUT 1 MINUTE HAD PASSED WITH THE ENGINE IDLING IN PARK. I OPENED THE HOOD AND LOOKED IN TO SEE THAT THE ALTERNATOR WAS SMOKING AND RED HOT INSIDE. I TRIED TO TURN OFF THE ENGINE, BUT NO RESPONSE FROM THE IGNITION BUTTON, THEN CRAZY ELECTRICAL THINGS HAPPENED WITH LIGHTS DASH WIPERS AND ETC., THEN THE ENGINE DIED, AND THERE WAS NOT ANY POWER OR BATTERY EVERYTHING WAS DEAD. I AM GLAD I WAS NOT OUT ON THE FREEWAY WHEN THIS HAPPENED, OR HAD THE FAMILY WITH ME. VEHICLE WAS TOWED TO AUBURN TRANSMISSION AND AUTO REPAIR. PH. (253)737-5913   IT IS MY BELIEF THAT  THE ALTERNATOR WENT TO A DEAD SHORT AND KILLED THE BATTERY SO FAST, IT WAS AMAZING TO SEE. I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE SOME KIND OF FUSEABLE LINK TO PREVENT SUCH A THING FROM OCCURRING.  THAT IS A MOST DANGEROUS DESIGN, FIRE PRONE.",
