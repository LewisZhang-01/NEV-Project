Per Owner's Guide: The system automatically turns off the parking lamp when the key is removed (remote key) or when the driver turns the engine off (smart key) and opens the driver-side door.  This does not meet the Owner's Guide's language.  Dealerships and inspection services did not confirm/reproduce this. There are no warning lights or indicators of this.",
