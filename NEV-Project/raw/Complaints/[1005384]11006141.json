IN ADDITION, THERE IS CONCERN THAT THE ACCUMULATED WATER MAY THEN LEAK THROUGH A SEAM IN THE HOUSING ONTO THE AIR BAG CONTROL MODULE POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN A SHORT CIRCUIT OF THE MODULE. A SHORT CIRCUIT MAY CAUSE THE AIR BAGS TO BECOME DISABLED OR INADVERTENTLY DEPLOY.  THIS IS SIMILAR TO 2013 CAMRY MODEL RECALL. NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 13V442000.  I THINK THE RECALL SHOULD EXTEND TO 2014 CAMRY MODEL AS WELL.",
