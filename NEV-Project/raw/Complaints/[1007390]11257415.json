PARKED THE CAR, CAME BACK TO GO BACK HOME AND THE KEY &#128273; IN THE IGNITION WOULD NOT TURN. IT WAS LOCKED OR JAMMED, DON'T KNOW. KEY WOULD NOT TURN IN THE IGNITION SWITCH TO TURN THE CAR ON!!! I WENT TO THE INTERNET AND FOUND THAT THERE WAS A RECALL FROM GENERAL MOTORS ON MY 2009 CHEVY COBALT. I FOUND A NHTSA CAMPAIGN ID# 14V171000 THAT SHOWS THE RECALL FOR MY CAR. IT DESCRIBES AN IGNITION SWITCH RECALL. I CALLED THE CHUCK NASH CHEVROLET WHERE I BOUGHT THE CAR AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD REPAIRED THE RECALL. APPARENTLY THEY REPAIRED IT WITH A DEFECTIVE IGNITION-SWITCH OR NOT AT ALL. THE RECALL STATES THAT SOME VEHICLES WERE REPAIRED WITH DEFECTIVE OR USED PARTS. MARY BARRA, GENERAL MOTORS CEO STATED THAT ALL AFFECTED RECALL VEHICLES WOULD BE REPAIRED UP TO CUSTOMER SAFETY STANDARDS. I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP IN THIS MATTER. THIS CAR IS MY ONLY MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION. THANKS. GOD BLESS.",
