        "summary": "FUEL PUMP RELAY BURNS OUT AND IS SO HOT TO THE TOUCH IT WILL BURN YOUR HAND. WAS FOUND WHEN THE CAR WOULD NOT START. HAS HAPPENED TWICE NOW, A WEEK APART, AND ON THE SECOND OCCURRENCE THE FUEL PUMP WAS REPLACED BY THE MECHANIC TO RULE OUT A POSSIBLE SHORT CAUSING THE ISSUE. THE RELAY IS STILL GETTING HOT SO MUCH SO THAT THE SEAT GETS HOT AND I FEAR IT WILL CATCH ON FIRE. THE MECHANIC IS GOING TO LOOK AT THE FUSE BLOCK TO SEE IF THERE IS CORROSION OR DAMAGED WIRING CAUSING THE ISSUE. THE RELAY WAS HOT WHEN THE CAR WAS RUNNING, AND JUST HADN'T COOLED BY THE TIME IT WAS FOUND. THIS SPEAKS FOR HOW HOT IT WAS GETTING AS IT BURNED THE MECHANIC WHEN IT HAD BEEN SITTING A FEW MINUTES. IT DOES COOL DOWN AFTER A WHILE SO IT IS NOT HEATING UP WHILE STATIONARY.",
