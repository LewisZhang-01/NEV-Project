        "summary": "I PURCHASED THIS CAR BRAND NEW IN 2010 WITH 5 MILES ON THE VEHICLE.  THE CAR WAS SERVICED REGULARLY AT MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP.  I FIRST REPORTED THAT THE TRANSMISSION OCCASIONALLY \"BUMPED\" WHEN THE VEHICLE HAD AROUND 30, 000 MILES.  AFTER CHECKING OUT THE CAR, I WAS TOLD THEY DIDN'T SEE AN ISSUE.  I REPLACED THE TIMING CHAIN APPROXIMATELY 90,000 WHEN I TOOK HER IN FOR HER 100,000 SERVICE.  WITHIN 4,000 MILES OF THIS COMPLETE CHECK-UP AND VERY COSTLY SERVICE, THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT COMPLETELY !  I CONTACTED MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND ASKED IT THERE WAS A RECALL AFTER DISCOVERING THAT NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS HAD BEEN MADE ON THE MALIBU FOR THIS EXACT SAME ISSUE.  I THEN CONTACTED GM AND WAS TOLD THAT THERE WASN'T ANYTHING THEY COULD OR WERE WILLING TO DO TO HELP OFFSET THIS COST ETC.  THERE IS NO WAY THE TRANSMISSION SHOULD GO OUT COMPLETELY IN A 2010 VEHICLE THAT HAS ONLY 100,000 MILES ON IT THAT HAD JUST BEEN CHECKED OVER COMPLETELY BY THE DEALERSHIP.  I REALIZE THAT MY CAR IS 7 YEARS OLD AND WOULD HAVE LOVED FOR THIS TO BE COVERED COMPLETELY, BUT HONESTLY, I WOULD HAVE SETTLED FOR A LITTLE COMPENSATION AND GENUINE CONCERN. I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO AAMCO  WHERE IS COST ME IN EXCESS ON $3,000 TO HAVE THE BROKEN WAVE PLATES REPLACED. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW MANY COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST MALIBU TRANSMISSION ISSUES AND SEEK RESTITUTION IF THAT IS A POSSIBLE OUTCOME.",
