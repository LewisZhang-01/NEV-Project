THE CAR HAS POOR ACCELERATION, ESPECIALLY GOING UP HILLS AND MERGING INTO TRAFFIC (MOVING, CITY). IT HESITATES AT TRAFFIC SIGNALS (FROM A DEAD STOP).  THE VEHICLE TENDS TO SWAY SIDE TO SIDE FROM TIME TO TIME (MOVING, CITY),  THE VEHICLE IS UNDER WARRANTY AND HAS BEEN LOOKED AT BY TWO DIFFERENT KIA DEALERS.  A TECHNICIAN HAS RODE ALONG WITH ME; FELT MY CONCERNS, BUT CANNOT DUPLICATE IT.  I WAS TOLD IN MARCH 2017 THAT THE COMPUTER HAD BEEN \"TWEAKED\", BUT NO FURTHER INFORMATION.",
