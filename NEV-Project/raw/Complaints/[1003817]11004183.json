I'M VERY CONCERNED WITH THE AIRBAGS POTENTIALLY BEING TORN IF DEPLOYED, OR PLASTIC BEING PROJECTED IF THE AIRBAG EVER HAS TO BE DEPLOYED. I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. I HAVE REACHED OUT TO GMC ONLY TO BE TOLD IT'S COSMETIC AND WON'T BE COVERED, REGARDLESS OF WHAT I THINK OR THE CONCERNS I HAVE THE CASE IS CLOSED. THERE IS A FACEBOOK GROUP WITH OVER 6,500 FOLLOWERS THAT HAVE SIMILAR CONCERNS WITH ALL CONCERNS FALLING UPON DEAF EARS. I'M HOPING A RECALL CAN BE PUT INTO PLACE TO POTENTIALLY SAVE LIVES. I'M PRAYING PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO DIE FOR THIS TO BE CONSIDERED A VALID ISSUE.   I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED THE ISSUE, POOR MANUFACTURING, AIR BAG NOT PROPERLY INSTALLED, OR WHAT. I WOULD LOVE FOR SOME RESEARCH TO BE DONE AS WELL.",
