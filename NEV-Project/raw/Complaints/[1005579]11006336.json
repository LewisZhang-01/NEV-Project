        "summary": "I WENT TO MELODY TOYOTA IN SAN BRUNO, CA (SUMMER 2016) TO HAVE AIRBAG RECALL TAKEN CARE OF.  THEY TOLD ME THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE PART AND THEY WOULD CALL ME FOR AN APPOINTMENT WHEN IT CAME IN.  AFTER A MONTH WITH NO WORD FROM THEM I STOPPED BY AGAIN.  THEY TOLD ME I DIDN'T NEED TO STOP BY BECAUSE THEY WOULD CALL ME WHEN THE PART CAME IN.  THAT WAS OVER A YEAR AGO AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T CALLED!    I GOT A REMINDER ABOUT THE RECALL SUMMER 2017 AND MADE AN APPOINTMENT AT ONE TOYOTA OF OAKLAND FOR 10AM 7/18/17.  THEY TOLD ME CAR WOULD BE READY BY 2:30.  WHEN 4:00 CAME AND I HAD NO WORD I ASKED.  AT AROUND 4:30 I WAS TOLD THEY HADN'T STARTED YET AND THEY ASKED ME IF I WANTED TO MAKE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT FOR ANOTHER DAY.  I WALKED OUT TOTALLY DISGUSTED.    OBVIOUSLY THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIPS HAVE PUT THIS AIRBAG RECALL AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR PRIORITY LIST.      I WILL TRY FINDING A THIRD DEALERSHIP TODAY AND HOPE TO BE DONE WITH THIS SOON.",
