WHEN THE TRUCK IS LIGHT WITH INTERIOR WEIGHT THE E BRAKE WILL NOT HOLD, SO WHEN IT IS HEAVY WITH EQUIPMENT IT IS EVEN WORSE.  THIS IS A HAZARD AND CAN CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.   WE HAVE HAD THIS LOOKED AT SEVERAL TIMES BY OUR RAM PROMASTER DIESEL MECHANIC AND WAS TOLD IT WAS A \"POOR DESIGN\" AND THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN DO.
