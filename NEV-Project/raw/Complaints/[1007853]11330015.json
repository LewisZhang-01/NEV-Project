        "summary": "4 TIMES OVER PAST 10 MONTHS (3 IN PAST 2 WEEKS) THE POWER STEERING WENT OUT WHEN THE CAR WAS LEFT IN THE SUN LONGER THAN AN HOUR.  THE 1ST 3 TIMES THE DASHBOARD WARNING LIGHTS RE-SET THEMSELVES AND THE POWER STEERING STARTED WORKING AGAIN AFTER TURNING OFF THE CAR AFTER BEING FORCED TO DRIVE HOME THE CAR W/O POWER STEERING.  THE LAST TIME THE LIGHTS STAYED ON AND THE POWER STEERING REMAINED INOPERABLE.  FOR THE SECOND TIME IN 10 MONTHS, I HAD TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALER - THIS TIME THEY ARE REPLACING THE STEERING COLUMN AND THE POWER STEERING UNIT.  I THOUGHT THAT I HAD SIMPLY BOUGHT A \"LEMON\" - I HAD TO HAVE THE TRANSMISSION REPLACED LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR BUT AFTER LOOKING UP MY MAKE AND MODEL ON CARCOMPLAINTS.COM I REALIZED THAT MANY OTHER SONATAS BESIDES MINE HAVE LOST POWER STEERING, MANY OF THEM WHILE DRIVING (SOME AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS).  BESIDES BRAKES, STEERING IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST SAFETY ISSUE ON ANY CAR.  HYUNDAI HAS A REALLY GOOD WARRANTY AND I BOUGHT A MORE COMPREHENSIVE WARRANTY SO MY REPAIRS SHOULD NOT COST ME ANYTHING BUT THE FACT REMAINS, THIS MODEL SONATA HAS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY DEFECT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY HYUNDAI BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED, IF IT HAS NOT HAPPENED ALREADY.  I FEEL FORTUNATE THAT MY POWER STEERING NEVER WENT OUT WHILE I WAS DRIVING THE CAR LIKE MANY OTHERS DID.  *TR",
