I REPORTED THIS INCIDENT TO JARRETT-GORDON FORD WINTER HAVEN AND THEY ADJUSTED THE HOOD LATCH. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS DID NOT CORRECT THE PROBLEM AND I HAD ANOTHER OCCURRENCE OF THE HOOD OPENING AT HIGHWAY SPEED IN WHICH THE SAFETY LATCH PREVENTED A POTENTIALLY SERIOUS ACCIDENT. I AGAIN TOOK THE CAR BACK TO THE SAME DEALER - JARRETT-GORDON FORD WINTER HAVEN AND THIS TIME THEY REPLACED THE HOOD LATCH MECHANISM. THIS CORRECTED THE PROBLEM AND NO FURTHER INCIDENTS OCCURRED.",
