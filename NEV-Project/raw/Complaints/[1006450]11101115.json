THE CONTACT STATED THAT THERE WAS A STRONG VIBRATION COMING FROM THE VEHICLE, THE SERVICE ENGINE INDICATOR ILLUMINATED, AND THE U-JOINTS HAD NOT BEEN PROPERLY LUBRICATED FROM THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THE DEALER (LEGACY TOYOTA, 3800 W TENNESSEE ST, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32304, (850) 688-9264) DIAGNOSED THAT THE TIRES WERE THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURES. THE DEALER DID NOT REPLACE THE DRIVETRAIN AND THE U-JOINTS. THE CONTACT CONSTANTLY HAD TO LUBE THE U-JOINTS TO PREVENT DRYNESS, WHICH WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE DRIVETRAIN TO FRACTURE. THE CONTACT, A MECHANIC, REPLACED THE U-JOINTS AND TOOK THE DRIVESHAFT TO THE DEALER TO INSPECT THE PART, BUT NO REMEDY WAS PROVIDED. THE MANUFACTURER ISSUED A SERVICE CAMPAIGN AND INDICATED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS EXCLUDED; THEREFORE, THE DEALER REFUSED TO REPLACE THE U-JOINTS AND THE DRIVESHAFT. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKEN BACK TO THE SAME DEALER FOR FURTHER DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOTIFIED OF THE FAILURES AND PROVIDED NO REMEDY. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS NOT AVAILABLE.",
