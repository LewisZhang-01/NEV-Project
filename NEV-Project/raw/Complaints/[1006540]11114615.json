        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING AT 60 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY, THE ELECTRIC POWER STEERING LOCKED UP DURING A TURN. THE SYSTEM LOCKED FOR LESS THAN A SECOND, AND THEN FREED UP SO THAT I COULD FINISH THE TURN. LUCKILY THE STEERING DID NOT LOCK UP BEFORE OR AFTER THE TURN, SO THAT I COULD COMPLETE THE TURN AND GET OFF THE HIGHWAY. AFTER GETTING OFF THE HIGHWAY, I STAYED ON COUNTY ROADS TO REDUCE SPEED TO 30MPH AND SEE IF THE REDUCED SPEED HELPED. AFTER 30 MORE MINUTES OF DRIVING THE STEERING WAS COMPLETELY LOCKING UP WHEN DRIVING STRAIGHT OR TURNING, AND SCREECHING VERY LOUDLY. THE \"SERVICE ADVANCE TRAC\" MESSAGE SHOWED UP, FOLLOWED BY \"ELECTRIC POWER STEERING FAULT\" MESSAGE. I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO THE NEAREST MECHANIC, WHERE THEY SAID THE WHOLE ELECTRIC POWER STEERING NEEDS TO BE REPLACED, COSTING AROUND $2000. I HAVE NOT GOTTEN THE WORK DONE YET AND HOPE THAT THERE IS A RECALL WITH THE AMOUNT OF COMPLAINTS FOR THIS SAME ISSUE. IF THE STEERING WERE TO LOCK UP ANY SOONER THAN IT HAD, THERE COULD HAVE BEEN MAJOR INJURY OR DEATH.",
