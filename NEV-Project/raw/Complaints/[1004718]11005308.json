MEANWHILE, I AM UNABLE TO TAKE MY WIFE OR OTHER FAMILY/FRIENDS ANYWHERE IN MY CAR BECAUSE I FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES (BASED ON THE RECALL LETTER'S WARNING OF INJURY/DEATH).  I CALLED AUDI OF AMERICA TWICE, AND THEY HAVE NOT STARTED SOURCING PARTS.  I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP, AND THEY HAVE NO RECEIVED PARTS, NOR HAVE THEY REPLACED ANY TAKATA AIRBAGS TO DATE.    IT APPEARS THAT EVEN THOUGH A RECALL WAS ISSUED, NOTHING IS HAPPENING.",
