I BROUGHT CAR IN AND WAS CHARGED $250 TO REPLACE THE BRAKE LIGHT SWITCH. I SAW THIS WAS A RECALL ON 2007 KIA SEDONA BUT DEALER STATED IT DID NOT INCLUDE MY KIA SEDONA HOW CAN THE SAME EXACT THING THAT HAPPENED ON ALMOST 1 MILLION KIA AND HYUNDAI NOT BE THE SAME THING ON MY KIA SEDONA. I BELIEVE MY KIA SHOULD HAVE BEEN PART OF THE RECALL AND I SHOULD BE ISSUED A REFUND FOR THIS REPAIR.",
