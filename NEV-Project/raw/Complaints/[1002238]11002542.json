        "summary": "I PURCHASED A 2016 CHEVROLET TAHOE LAST YEAR FROM WALKER CHEVROLET. THE VEHICLE HAS 16,000 MILES. ISSUES I HAVE WITH THE VEHICLE. CURRENT DEALERSHIP IS JIM ELLIS CHEVROLET. 1. TRANSMISSION JERKS WHEN SHIFTING. 2. TRANSMISSION WILL SHIFT INTO FIRST GEAR WHEN HILL ASSIST IS ACTIVATED. 3. NAVIGATION GOES BLANK. 4. VOLUME BUTTON QUITS WORKING AND VOLUME TURNS ALL THE WAY UP. 5. TAHOE SQUEAKS FROM V8 TO V4. 6. LOUD METAL POPPING NOISE WHEN TAKING SHARP LEFT TURNS. 7. NAVIGATION ASSISTANT WILL NOT MUTE. 8. NAVIGATION WILL NOT SHUT OFF WHEN THE CAR IS OFF AND DOORS ARE LOCKED. 9. SUSPENSION MAKES AWFUL NOISES WHEN GOING OVER SPEED BUMPS AND FLEXING. 10. TAHOE HAS A VERY ROUGH IDLE IN FIRST GEAR. MY PRIMARY CONCERN IS THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE. MY WIFE ALMOST WRECKED THE TAHOE AFTER THE VOLUME WOULD NOT TURN DOWN FROM BEING STUCK AT THE HIGHEST VOLUME LEVEL. A TRACTOR TRAILER ALMOST REAR-ENDED US AFTER THE HILL ASSIST ACTIVATED AND THE GEAR WENT INTO TO FIRST. I WENT TO JIM ELLIS AND TOLD THEM SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS AND I WAS TOLD THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE TRANSMISSION BECAUSE THEY CAN'T REPRODUCE THE ISSUE. I DO NOT WANT MY FAMILY'S LIFE IN DANGER JUST BECAUSE THE ISSUE CANNOT BE REPRODUCED WITH THE TRANSMISSION. I WAS ALSO TOLD THE SUSPENSION AND STEERING WAS FIXED, BUT I IMMEDIATELY NOTICED THE ISSUE PULLING OUT OF THE DEALERSHIP.THIS IS ANOTHER SAFETY CONCERN. I WAS TOLD THE NAVIGATION WAS FIXED, BUT THE NAVIGATION AND VOLUME PROBLEMS ARE HAPPENING MORE OFTEN THE LONGER I DRIVE THE VEHICLE. YET ANOTHER SAFETY CONCERN. I CALLED GM CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND CONTACTED THE DEALERSHIP.",
