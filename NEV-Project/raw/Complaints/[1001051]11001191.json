THE ENGINE REDUCED POWER AND WAS STALLING AS I IMMEDIATELY STARTED TO CROSS THE HIGHWAY FROM THE FURTHEST LEFT LANE IN ORDER TO GET TO SAFETY ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD - I WAS WITH MY PARENTS AND MY HANDICAPPED NEPHEW AND SCARED FOR ALL OF OUR LIVES. THE ENGINE \"SPUTTERED AND VIBRATED\" BEFORE STOPPING. I DIDN'T NOTICE ANYTHING WRONG OR ANY CHANGE IN THE WAY THE CAR DROVE. THIS WAS A VERY DANGEROUS AND UNSAFE INCIDENT.",
