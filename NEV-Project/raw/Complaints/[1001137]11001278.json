        "summary": "2012 ALTITUDE. SOMETIMES WHEN I AM DRIVING THE ENGINE WILL CUT OUT. THERE ARE NO WARNINGS, NO GLITCHES IN THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS OR ANYTHING. THE ONLY WAY I KNOW THE ENGINE CUTS OUT IS THAT THERE IS NO RESPONSE FROM THE GAS PEDAL AND I LOSE POWER STEERING.     I HAVE TO SHIFT INTO NEUTRAL, EASE ON THE BRAKE, PRESS THE START BUTTON, AND THEN WHEN IT RESTARTS I SHIFT IT BACK INTO DRIVE AND PICK UP WHERE I LEFT OFF.     LIKE I SAID, THERE ARE NO GLITCHES IN THE LIGHTS OR ANYTHING. NO CODES OR ENGINE LIGHTS OR ANYTHING. I BOUGHT IT IN SEPT 2016 AND ITS BEEN IN THE SHOP ABOUT 9 TIMES. THEY CANT EVEN GET THE PROBLEM TO HAPPEN, LET ALONE FIX IT.    I EMAILED THE JEEP AND FIAT CEOS FOR A PAPER TRAIL IN CASE I GOT INTO A WRECK- WANTED TO COVER MY ***- AND THEY RESPONDED. THEY SAID THEY'D PAY FOR MY RENTAL CAR EVERY TIME I BROUGHT MY JEEP IN FOR SERVICE ON THIS ISSUE. SO THAT HAS LIMITED ME TO BRINGING IT INTO THE DEALER. THEY ARE GIVING ME A NUMBER TO ALLOW ME TO PURCHASE A NEW JEEP AT EMPLOYEE COST, BUT, CONSIDERING I BOUGHT A 2012 IN 2016, I CAN'T AFFORD A 2017 MODEL. I'D HAVE TO SACRAFICE A LOT OF MY CURRENT OPTIONS TO TRY TO FIND A VEHICLE PRICED TO MAINTAIN MY CURRENT PAYMENTS.    THIS HAS HAPPENED FROM ALL SPEEDS. IT HAPPENED TO ME WHILE DRIVING AROUND 70MPH, 30MPH, AND EVEN AFTER I CAME TO A RED LIGHT, AND THE LIGHT TURNED GREEN, I PRESSED THE GAS AND GOT NOTHING...    THE ONLY THING THAT I HAVE NOTICED, AND I'M NOT EVEN SURE I REALLY NOTICED THIS, BUT IF I'M DRIVING HARD, AND GO FROM FAST TO SLOW QUICKLY, BUT NOT SLAMMING ON MY BRAKES, KIND OF LIKE FLYING DOWN THE STREET AND THEN THE LIGHT TURNS SO YOU GOTTA COME TO A STOP SOON. I HOPE THAT MAKES SENSE. I'M NOT EVEN SURE THIS HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.     I HAVE AFTERMARKET HIDS INSTALLED (DDM TUNING WITH CANBUS PLUS OR WHATEVER IT IS) HOWEVER, IT'S HAPPENED DAY OR NIGHT, LIGHTS ON AND LIGHTS OFF.",
