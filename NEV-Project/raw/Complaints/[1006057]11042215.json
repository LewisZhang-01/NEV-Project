I CONTACTED THE BMW DEALER (NORTH SCOTTSDALE BMW, SCOTTSDALE AZ) AND WAS TOLD THE PART WAS NOT AVAILABLE AND WE WOULD BE CONTACTED WHEN IT WAS RECEIVED. WE FOLLOWED UP APRIL AND WERE TOLD THE SAME THING. THE CAR WAS THEN RELOCATED TO ALABAMA IN MAY. IN JUNE WE CONTACTED THE LOCAL BMW DEALER (MOBILE BMW) AND WERE TOLD THE SAME STORY. WE FOLLOWED UP IN SEPTEMBER AND WERE TOLD, AGAIN, THE PART IS NOT AVAILABLE.     THIS IS REALLY BAD GIVEN THE SAFETY CONCERNS INVOLVED. IT IS NOW 8 MONTHS SINCE RECEIVING THE ORIGINAL RECALL NOTICE AND WE STILL HAVE A POTENTIAL DEADLY ISSUE THAT BMW DEALERS IN TWO STATES ARE CONSISTENTLY IGNORING.",
