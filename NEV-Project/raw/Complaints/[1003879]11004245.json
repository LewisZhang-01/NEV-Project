WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD, THE ENGINE LIGHT AND THE ENGINE CONTROLLER LIGHT WILL SUDDENLY COME ON AND THE VEHICLE WILL SEEM TO LOOSE POWER. APPLYING THE BREAK TO SLOW THE VEHICLE DOES NOT SEEM TO HELP AS THE VEHICLE WILL BEGIN TO ACCELERATE BACK UP TO DRIVING SPEED ONCE THE BRAKE PEDAL IS RELEASED (ALMOST LIKE WHEN THE CRUISE CONTROL RENEGADES. THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES. THE VEHICLE WAS TAKE TO THE JEEP DEALER WHERE'RE THEY RESET THE CODE SEVERAL TIMES AND RELEARNED THE PEDAL POSITION SENSOR WITH A FIRMWARE REBOOT. THIS HAS NOT FIXED THE ISSUE AND JEEP IS NOT ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSE. THIS PROBLEM CAN CAUSE AN ACCIDENT AS THE VEHICLE HAS SUDDENLY ACCELERATED UP TO 30-35 MPH WHEN TURNING INTO PARKING LOTS OR AWAY FROM STOP SIGNS. THIS ALSO HAPPENS WHEN IN PUTTING THE VEHICLE IN REVERSE.",
