THE FAILURE OF #1 CAUSED THE ABS AND TCS LIGHTS ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL TO TURN ON; AND THE LOSS OF #2 CAUSED THE \"CHECK ENGINE\" LIGHT TO TURN ON. TOTAL COST TO REPLACE BOTH VIA NON-DEALER MECHANIC WAS $2,425, WHICH OWNER PAID. ONLINE RESEARCH INDICATES THIS IS A COMMON FAILURE FOR THIS MAKE/MODEL, SO FILING COMPLAINT WITH NHTSA FOR THE PUBLIC RECORD.",
