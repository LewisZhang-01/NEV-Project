THE YEAR MAKE AND MODEL OF MY CAR HAS A RECALL (2/2013 RECALL N09 REPROGRAM POWERTRAIN CONTROL MODULE)  I HAVE HAVE BEEN REPORTED MY ISSUE TO FIAT DEALERSHIP FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS AND WAS TOLD THAT BASED ON MY VIN NUMBER I DO NOT HAVE A RECALL. WHEN I SERVICE MY CAR AT DEALERSHIP THEY JUST TURN OFF MY ENGINE LIGHT. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PASS INSPECTION OF MY VEHICLE IN OVER TWO YEARS. MY MECHANIC EXPLAINED TO ME THAT I HAVE A RECALL AND HE CANNOT PASS INSPECTION. I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE MY CAR, BUT CANNOT SELL IT OR TRADE IT IN DIE TO THE ENGINE LIGHT ERROR. I HAVE A RECORD OF ALL OF MY RECEIPTS. THIS STARTED IN JANUARY 2018. I BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD FILE CHARGES AGAINST FIAT AND WOULD NEED LEGAL ADVISE.     THANK YOU.",
