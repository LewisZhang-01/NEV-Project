IT JERKS REALLY HARD WHEN YOU TAKE OFF FROM A STOP, IT LOSES POWER WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD, THE STEERING GETS REALLY TIGHT AND YOU CAN BARELY TURN THE WHEEL WHILE DRIVING, IF YOU DONT WAIT FOR THE CAR TO JERK TWICE WHEN YOU PUT IT IN DRIVE IT WILL GO BACKWARDS IN REVERSE WHILE IN DRIVE, THE RADIO AND CLIMATE CONTROLL CONSTANTLY RESET DO TO POWER FAILURE, SOMETIMES IT DONT WANT TO START, THE CHECK ENINE LIGHT DID'NT EVEN COME ON UNTIL A WEEK AFTER THE PROBLEMS STARTED, IT THROWS WARNING LIGHTS LIKE LOW TIRE PRESSURE OR TRACTION CONTROLL WHEN NOTHING IS WRONG, AND THE DEALERSHIP WANTS TO CHARGE ME $800 (THAT I CAN NOT AFFORD) JUST TO SEE WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO TRY AND FIX IT. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHATS WRONG OR IF THEY EVEN CAN BUT THEY EXPECET ME TO PAY THEM!!! I HAVE ONLY HAD MY CAR 15 MONTHS AND IT ONLY HAS 38,000 MILES ON IT,AND NOW I FIND OUT THAT IT HAS WENT WAY DOWN IN VALUE DUE TO ALL THE RECALLS. WHAT CAN I DO????",
