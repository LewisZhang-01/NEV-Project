SO FAR, THE BRAKES HAVE BROKEN FREE AFTER APPLYING AN EXTRA AMOUNT OF GAS.  THEN, A LOUD BANG IS HEARD WHEN THE BRAKES LET GO.  THIS CONCERNS ME BECAUSE WHAT IF THIS HAPPENS IN A TIGHT PARKING SPOT, WITH CARS IN FRONT AND IN BACK?  WITH THE SUDDEN RELEASE OF THE BRAKES, THE CAR MAY LURCH INTO EITHER OF THE CARS.  I HAVE COMPLAINED TO THE DEALER TWICE.  THE FIRST TIME THEY COULDN'T FIND A PROBLEM.  THE SECOND TIME, THEY TOOK 2 DAYS TO DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM AFTER I TOLD THEM THAT WET BRAKES MAY BE THE CAUSE.  THEY THEN TOLD ME THE PROBLEM IS NORMAL, ALL THEIR CARS DO IT.  THEIR SERVICE ORDER DOES NOT REFLECT WHAT THEY TOLD ME.",
