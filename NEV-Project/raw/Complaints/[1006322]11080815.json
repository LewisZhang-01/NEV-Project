IF I DIDN'T KNOW THIS ROAD I AM POSITIVE I WOULD HAVE HAD AN ACCIDENT.   THE MANIFOLD WAS CHANGED IN 2013.  TODAY IS MARCH 22,  2018.  LAST WEEK I HAD THE MANIFOLD CHANGED AGAIN.  CRACKED AGAIN.  THERE WERE FUMES COMING INTO THE PASSENGER AREA.  THE CAR IS IN THE REPAIR GARAGE AGAIN BECAUSE THE FUMES ARE EVEN WORSE.  THE CAR HAS ALWAYS HAD A LOUD TICKING SOUND.  IT USES A LOT OF OIL.  I COMPLAINED TO THE DEALER BEFORE THE WARRANTY RAN OUT.  THEY DID AN OIL CONSUMPTION TEST AND SAID THE OIL USE WAS WITHIN NORMAL RANGE.  HOW CAN THIS BE NORMAL RANGE WHEN I PUT A COUPLE QUARTS OF OIL EVERY 200 MILES.  THIS CAR IS JUNK.",
