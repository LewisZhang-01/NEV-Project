IN EITHER CASE THE DRIVE TRAIN IS PUT INTO A DIMINISHED MODE WHICH RENDERS THE VEHICLE UNDER POWERED AND ALSO EVENTUALLY EMIT WHITE SMOKE.  ONCE IN THIS DEMINISHED MODE ESPECIALLY ON THE HIGHWAY THE VEHICLE IS A HAZARD TO DRIVE AS IT CAN BARELY KEEP UP WITH THE SPEED LIMIT AND IN SOME SITUATION WILL NOT ALLOW FOR EMERGENCY MANUVERS DUE TO LACK OF POWER.  IN MY CASE THERE WERE TWO PREVIOUS INCIDENTS THAT WERE RESET BY THE DEALERSHIP WHICH INDICATED IMPENDING FAILURE UNTIL THE 3RD INCIDENT IN WHICH THE PUMP LEAKED FUEL INTO THE CYLINDER CAUSING THE WHITE SMOKE.  THIS SMOKE IN ACCESS CAN ALSO BLIND THE CAR BEHIND YOU.  AFTER THIS INCIDENT I ALSO CONTACTED BMW CUSTOMER SERVICES AND ENQUIRED ABOUT ANY RECALLS AND THAT ALL FUEL INJECTORS SHOULD BE REPLACED.  THEY REPLIED IN THE NEGATIVE AND SUGGEST I TALK TO THE NEAREST DEALERSHIP.",
