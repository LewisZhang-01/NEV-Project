        "summary": "The contact owned a 2002 Mazda Tribute. The contact stated that while driving at 30 mph, a pop noise was heard, the vehicle had unintended acceleration; the engine revved and sped up to 80 - 90 mph, inadvertently, and the brakes failed to engage after the contact had depressed with both feet on the brake pedal. The contact made a turn into a park and the vehicle slid, then crashed into a tree. There was smoke coming from under the hood and the contact turned off the vehicle before exiting and walking until she got assistance from a bystander, who called the police. A police report was filed. The contact did not receive medical attention at the scene but later went to the emergency room for injuries sustained with six broken ribs. The vehicle was towed to a tow yard. The dealer and manufacturer were not made aware of the failure. The failure mileage was approximately 230,000.",
