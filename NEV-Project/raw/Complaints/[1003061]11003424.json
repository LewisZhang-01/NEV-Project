BUT I CALLED HONDA AND THEY TOLD ME MY CAR WAS NOT COVERED BY THIS. I HAVE A PROXIMATELY 54,000 MILES ON MY VEHICLE.    SECONDLY, MY VEHICLE VIBRATES OR SHAKES A BIT AT HIGHER SPEEDS OF 65 MPH AND ABOVE ON THE HIGHWAY. NOT SURE IF THIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM OR SHOULD BE ADDRESSED BY HONDA.     FINALLY, I DEVELOP BACKACHES DUE TO THE DISCOMFORT OF THE SEATS WHICH I SUSPECT ARE NOT CORRECTLY OR ERGONOMICALLY DESIGNED. AFTER ABOUT 30 TO 40 MINUTES OF DRIVING I EXPERIENCE LOWER BACK PAIN WHICH I NORMALLY NEVER HAVE.  THIS DISSUADES ME FROM DRIVING FOR MUCH LONGER DISTANCES AS I REMAIN STIFF AND NEED TO REST IN ORDER TO RECOVER FROM THE BACK PAIN AFTER DRIVING THE VEHICLE.",
