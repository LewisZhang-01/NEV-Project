THIS STARTED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WHEN WE BOUGHT THE CAR.  WE TOOK IT TO THE FORD DEALER. THE INTERNAL CLUTCH HAS BEEN CHANGED OUT 3 TIMES AT FORD OF KIRKLAND IN KIRKLAND, WA. THE CAR WAS PURCHASED AT HARRIS FORD LYNWOOD, WA.  FORD SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS AND EITHER REPLACE THE CAR OR COME UP WITH A PERMANENT FIX.   I SEE THERE IS A LAWSUIT ALREADY FILED AGAINST FORD IN CA.  WE OF COURSE OWE WAY MORE THAN IT IS WORTH",
