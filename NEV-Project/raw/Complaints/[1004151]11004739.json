WORRIED ABOUT AIR BAG COMING OUT. I'M JUST NOW READING THAT A LETTER WAS SENT OUT FROM TOYOTA ABOUT THIS TO OWNERS, BUT WE NEVER GOT ONE. WE HAVE GOTTEN ONE FOR A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS, BUT NOT FOR THIS AND WE DIDN'T GET ONE FOR CLICKING NOISE ON DRIVER'S DOOR EITHER, WHICH IS HAPPENING NOW. I KNOW THE CAR IS OLDER, BUT IF THESE ARE DEFECTS, TOYOTA SHOULD FIX THEM. I'M READING ABOUT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS.",
