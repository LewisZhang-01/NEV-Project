I HAVE TRIED CLOSING DOOR WITH FORCE AND IT STILL REGISTERS AS AJAR. THE PROBLEM IS IT CONSTANTLY MAKES A NOISE WHILE DRIVING AND THE DOME LIGHTS REMAIN ON AFTER DOOR IS CLOSED AND I AM AFRAID THAT IT WILL DRAIN MY BATTERY AND I WONT KNOW FOR SURE THAT THE DOOR ISN'T AJAR AND I WILL NOT BE AWARE IF IS IN REALITY AJAR. THIS COULD BEE A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. THIS OCCURS WHEN I GET IN THE CAR AND START THE IGNITION, ALSO OCCURS WHEN I TURN THE CAR OFF AND CLOSE AND LOCK THE CAR DOORS. THERE IS NOTHING TO TAKE A PICTURE OF, IT IS JUST A MICRO SWITCH MALFUNCTION. THIS HAS BEEN OCCURRING FOR THE LAST YEAR PLUS.",
