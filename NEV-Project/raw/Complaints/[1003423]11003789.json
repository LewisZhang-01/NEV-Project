I TOOK THE CAR FOR A ROUTINE OIL CHANGE AND 2 WEEKS LATER CHECKED IN A NORMAL RIDE TO WORK I REALIZED MY VEHICLE WAS SMOKING REALLY BAD FROM THE EXHAUST AND A HORRIBLE SMELL OF BURNT OIL FILLED THE INTERIOR. I TOOK THE CAR HOME AND PARKED IT. LESS THEN A WEEK LATER I GET A RECALL LETTER FOR THE ENGINE. I HAD THE CAR TOWED IN TO KIA THEY RAN A TEST MY ENGINE HAS BLOWN THEY PUT ME IN A RENTAL FOR 16 DAYS THIS BEGAN 6/20/17. I CAME TO GET MY CAR ON 7/8/17 AND DIDN'T EVEN GET DOWN THE STREET BEFORE GETTING PULLED OVER AND NOTIFIED THAT MY CAR IS ROARING SMOKE  THE EXHAUST AGAIN. I IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT IT BACK. THEY DROVE IT WITH ME AND ALSO AGREED IT WAS STILL SMOKING AND HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH OLD OIL BURNING OFF AND NOW MY A.C. IS ACTING WEIRD. THEY PLACED ME BACK IN A RENTAL AND TOLD ME THEY WOULD OPEN A TICKET. TO BE VERY HONEST I'M TRYING TO KEEP PRESENT BUT I'M VERY VERY SCARED AND CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING BACK IN THE CAR. I FEEL TRAPPED AND I'M STILL MAKING PAYMENTS ON SOMETHING I CAN'T EVEN DRIVE AND FEEL UNSAFE IN.",
