FORD WILL NOT FIX BECAUSE THEY CANNOT REPRODUCE. THIS IS DANGEROUS AND UNACCEPTABLE. NOT ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE A CAR RANDOMLY STALL OUT ON ANY STREET AND MANUFACTURER NOT WILLING OR CAN'T FIX. HAVE SEEN OTHER PEOPLE REPORTING THE SAME ISSUE WITH THEIR FORD ESCAPES BUT NO RESOLUTION AND NO HELP FROM FORD. I'VE CONTACTED DEALERSHIPS AND FORD SERVICE WITH SAME DISAPPOINTING RESPONSE. KEEP SPENDING MONEY HAVING DEALERSHIP LOOK AT IT IN HOPES THEY CAN REPRODUCE IT.
