SECOND INCIDENT - THIS AUGUST 2019 THE SAME DOOR STOPPED WORKING AND DOES NOT OPEN. THIRD INCIDENT - NOW MY PASSENGER SIDE SLIDING DOOR DOES NOT OPEN EITHER. BOTH SLIDING DOORS CURRENTLY DO NOT OPEN. THEY ARE LOCKED WITH NO MANUAL WAY TO UNLOCK OR OPEN.    THESE DOORS ARE FAULTY AND A SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN. I HAVE TO SMALL CHILDREN THAT IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY, ARE NOT ABLE TO ESCAPE. DODGE SERVICE CENTERS AREN'T ABLE TO PROVIDE COURTESY VEHICLES DURING THE REPAIR, WHICH ACCORDING TO MY EXPERIENCE, WOULD TAKE APPROXIMATELY 3-4 DAYS TO REPAIR THE FAULTY SLIDING DOOR.    THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPLAINTS REGARDING THESE SLIDING DOORS. IF THE SAME ISSUE KEEPS HAPPENING WITH THESE DOORS, THEN THE PROBLEM IS NOT WITH THE USERS. THE ISSUE IS IN THE MECHANISM OF THESE SLIDING DOORS.",
