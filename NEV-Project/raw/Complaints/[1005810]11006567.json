        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING MY 2016 MUSTANG GT BASE MODEL DOWN A STRAIGHT ROAD WITH THE TRACTION CONTROL \"ON\" AND THE CAR RANDOMLY LOCKED ALL OF THE WHEELS AND TURNED SIDEWAYS INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND ONLY STOPPING WHEN I HIT A CURB. WHILE SLIDING THERE WAS NO THROTTLE OR BRAKE CONTROL BECAUSE THE TRACTION SYSTEM LOCKED ALL FOUR WHEELS. I WENT TO THE FORD DEALER PREVIOUS TO THIS INSTANCE TO COMPLAIN THAT THE FRONT SUSPENSION WAS NOISY AND THE VEHICLE WAS HARD TO CONTROL ON CERTAIN ROAD SURFACES AND IT FELT VERY UNSAFE. AFTER GIVING THEM THIS INFORMATION THEY SCHEDULED ME FOR AN APPOINTMENT A WEEK LATER AND LET ME DRIVE OFF. SUBSEQUENT TO SAY, THE VEHICLE TOTALLY LOST CONTROL 3 DAYS BEFORE THE APPOINTMENT. ROAD SURFACE WAS DRY, IT WAS SUNNY 94 DEGREES AND I WAS TRAVELING AT 40MPH ON A STRAIGHT ROAD AND MY VEHICLE HAS 26K MILES. THE NOISE AND CONTROL ISSUE WAS MINISCULE BUT EXISTENT ON THE VEHICLE AT 14K MILES AND ONLY KEPT GETTING WORSE. I NOTIFIED THE DEALER OF THE POSSIBILITY  OF A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY WERE VERY DEFENSIVE AND MORE CONCERNED ABOUT CHARGING ME FOR THE DAMAGES THAT RESULTED FROM THE VEHICLE MALFUNCTION. I REQUESTED THAT THE COMPUTER LOGS BE PRESERVED AND SENT TO FORD AS IT MAY BE A SAFETY ISSUE AND I WAS TOLD THAT THEY WOULD CHARGE ME EXTRA FOR THAT AND THAT IT WOULD BE QUITE EXPENSIVE AS TO DISCOURAGE ME FROM REPORTING IT. I RETAINED A PRINTOUT OF MY INITIAL COMPLAINT THAT WAS DOCUMENTED AT THE DEALER UPON MY INITIAL VISIT. VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY UNDER FACTORY WARRANTY AND IS BEING DIAGNOSED FOR THE FRONT SUSPENSION NOISE ISSUE.",
