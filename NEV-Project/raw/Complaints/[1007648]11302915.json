I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE AND THE DEALER WILL NOT FIX THE PROBLEM.   THE BRAKES DIDN'T WORK,  DIDN'T STOP THE VEHICLE UPON MY LAST USE OF THE CAR.  THE VEHICLE DASHBOARD GIVES WARNING AND ERROR CODES RELATED TO THE BRAKES,  EMERGENCY BRAKE,  ABS, VSC, ETC. I HAVE WRITTEN LEXUS FOR ANY ASSISTANCE.   I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN MARYLAND FROM A USED CAR DEALER WHO CLEARED THE CODES BEFORE OBTAINING THE SAFETY INSPECTION.   HOWEVER IF THIS CAR WERE STARTED OR IF THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS TESTED,  THE VEHICLE WOULD HAVE FAILED.   AS WAS THE CASE WHEN I OBTAINED MY OWN SAFETY INSPECTION ON THE VEHICLE WHICH IT NOW FAILED",
