        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING LONG DISTANCES AT HIGH SPEEDS (75-80MPH) THE CAR SUDDENLY STOPPED ACCELERATING EVEN WITH GAS PEDAL FLOORED. THE CAR AUTOMATICALLY DECELERATED TO 50 MPH AND MAXED OUT AT 60 MPH. WE PULLED THE CAR OVER AND CHECKED ALL FLUIDS, WHICH PROVED NORMAL. WE TURNED THE CAR OFF TO LET IT COOL FOR A FEW MINUTES. ONCE THE CAR WAS TURNED BACK ON IT DROVE NORMALLY FOR ABOUT AN HOUR AND THEN THE PROBLEM OCCURRED AGAIN. THIS PATTERN CONTINUED FOR THE ENTIRE 7 HOUR ROAD TRIP. ONCE WE TOOK THE CAR INTO A NISSAN SHOP, WE WERE TOLD THAT NOTHING WAS FOUND DURING DIAGNOSTIC TESTING. WE WERE ALSO TOLD THIS WAS A REOCCURRING PROBLEM WITH NISSAN ROGUES DUE TO OVERHEATING OF TRANSMISSION/TRANSMISSION FLUID. IT WAS EXPLAINED TO US THAT NISSAN HAS NOT MADE A RECALL ON THIS, BUT HAS ONLY PROVIDED WARRANTIES FOR TRANSMISSION ISSUES ON 2008-2010 MODELS. UNFORTUNATELY MINE IS A 2011.  THIS PUT MY FAMILY IN VERY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS AS WE WERE ON INTERSTATES WITH CARS AND SEMI TRUCKS TRAVELING AT VERY HIGH VELOCITIES. SEMI TRUCKS WERE HONKING AND FLASHING LIGHTS AT US OUT OF ANGER AS IT PUT THEM IN DANGER AS WELL. THIS COULD HAVE EASILY CAUSED A ROAD RAGE INCIDENT.",
