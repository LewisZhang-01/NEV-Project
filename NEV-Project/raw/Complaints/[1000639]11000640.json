FOR AN EXAPMLE WHEN I PUSH THE GAS PEDAL ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING. THIS HAPPENS ABOUT TWO OR THREE TIMES WHEN I'M DRIVING IN A 20MINUTE SPAN. ALSO, WHEN I TURN OFF MY CAR (IT HAS A PUSH START) MY BREAK LIGHTS ARE ON. WHEN I TURN IT OFF I DON'T HAVE TO PUSH THE BREAK AND PUSH THE START BUTTON. (THE CAR THINKS I'M STEPPING ON THE BREAK).",
