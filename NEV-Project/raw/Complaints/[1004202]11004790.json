A MONTH AFTERWARD WE TRIED TO START THE VEHICLE, SINCE THIS DODGE DART IS A 6 SPEED MANUAL TRANSMISSION, THE CLUTCH NEEDS TO BE PRESSED TO START THE ENGINE. WHEN I DID THAT, THE CLUTCH WENT ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR AND STAYED THERE. WE TOOK IT TO GLEEN E THOMAS DODGE CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP LOCATED IN LONG BEACH CALIFORNIA. THEY KEEP THE CAR FOR A FULL 7 DAYS AND COULDN'T FIXED IT. AFTER THAT THE PROBLEM OF THE STICKING CLUTCH REMAINS UNTIL NOW, GETTING WORSE AS THE TIME GOES BY. EVERY WEEK THE ISSUE COMES UP.
