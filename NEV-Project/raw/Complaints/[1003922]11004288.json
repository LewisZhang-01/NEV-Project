OUR VEHICLE DOES HAVE MILES, BUT SINCE THIS EVIDENTLY IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM, WE DID THINK CHEVROLET WOULD AT LEAST OFFER SOME ASSISTANCE WITH THE REPAIR.  A LIFTER COLLAPSED AND THE COST TO REPLACE THE LIFTERS IS $3,500.00, PLUS TAX AT TOM GILL CHEVROLET IN FLORENCE, KY.  I DON'T BLAME THE DEALER FOR THIS, BUT CHEVROLET HAS REALLY DROPPED THE BALL ON THIS ISSUE FOR MANY, MANY VEHICLES WITH THE SAME ISSUE.  SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE TO BETTER PROTECT THE CONSUMER.",
