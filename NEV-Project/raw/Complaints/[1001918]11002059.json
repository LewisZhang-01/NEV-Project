        "summary": "I BOUGHT MY CAR USED IN 2015 AND ABOUT 1,000 MILES AFTER DRIVING IT OFF THE LOT THE AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON. I TOOK IT TO THE LOCAL LEXUS DEALERSHIP AND THEY DIAGNOSED IT AS THE DRIVER'S KNEE AIRBAG AND SAID THE ENTIRE AIRBAG WIRE HARNESS NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AND QUOTED ME $3,500. I LOOKED UP THE ISSUE AND FOUND THAT LEXUS HAD PREVIOUSLY ISSUED A TSIB ON IT (L-SB-0167-08). I ALSO READ MANY OWNERS AROUND THAT TIME WERE ABLE TO GET IT FIXED UNDER WARRANTY (72MO OR 70K MILES). UNFORTUNATELY THAT EXPIRED FOR ME 2 YEARS BEFORE I EVEN BOUGHT THE CAR. I'M VERY FRUSTRATED THAT THEY KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE, THAT IT'S RELATED TO AIRBAG SAFETY AND THEY ARE STILL ASKING ME TO PAY THOUSANDS. IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS AND THE LIGHT IS STILL ON.     PS: THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME SEVERAL TIMES THAT I WASN'T AFFECTED BY THE TAKETA RECALL BUT I LATER GOT THE RECALL NOTICE.",
