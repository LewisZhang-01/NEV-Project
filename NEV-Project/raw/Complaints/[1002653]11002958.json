BEING THAT MY CAR IS ONLY 5 YEARS OLD AND ONLY HAS 40K MILES I WAS SHOCKED. AFTER DOING RESEARCH AND TALKING TO THE DEALERSHIP I LEARNED THAT ALL 2012 BETTLES WITH THIS DIRECT FUEL INJECTION DESIGN HAVE THIS PROBLEM. IT IS SYSTEMATIC ISSUE WITHIN THE DESIGN OF THE FUEL INJECTION THAT CAUSES THE COILS TO FAIL AND THE CAR TO NEED A $900 CARBON CLEANING DONE EVERY FEW YEARS. HIGH GRADE GASOLINE OR/AND FUEL INJECTION CLEANER DOES NOT HELP. I CALLED THE VW AND THEY REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.",
