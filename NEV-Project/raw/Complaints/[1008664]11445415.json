        "summary": "Inaudible turn signal prompt: Older drivers who drive for miles with their turn signal on is the subject of many a cartoon and common source of highway frustration. It is also a safety issue when a vehicle does not perform the turn that it is apparently signaling to make.  I find myself being one of those older drivers who leaves their turn signal on. I have moderate hearing loss and do wear hearing aids, but not all the time. Perhaps my RAV4's audible prompt is quieter than others, but with road noise and the radio on I often do not hear it.  A simple solution to this problem would be the ability to control the volume of the audible turn signal prompt so it could be \"cranked up\" to be easily heard. If dashboard lights have a dimmer control, why don't turn signal prompts have a volume control? It seems like a simple solution and with today's touch control panels one that could be added for very little cost.  Thanks for considering my recommendation. It is a common safety problem that has a simple and low-cost solution.",
