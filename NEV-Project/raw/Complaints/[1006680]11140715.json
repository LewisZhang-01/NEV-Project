        "summary": "IN 2015, THERE WAS A RECALL FOR THE CLOCK SPRING.  A REPAIR WAS MADE, NOT A REPLACEMENT WHEN THE VEHICLE HAD APPROXIMATELY 30,000 MILES ON IT.  IN SEPT. 2018 AT APPROXIMATELY 56,000 MILES, THE AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON AND ALL STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS WERE LOST INCLUDING THE HORN.  VW IS REFUSING TO COVER THE REPAIR UNDER THE RECALL BECAUSE OF THE COVER THAT WAS INITIALLY INSTALLED IN 2015.  IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE COVER DID NOT FIX THE ISSUE AND THE CLOCK SPRINGS ARE FAULTY AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AS THEY AIRBAG AND HORN DO NOT WORK WHEN THEY FAIL.  IF THEY HAD REPLACED THE CLOCK SPRING IN 2015, I WOULD UNDERSTAND A SECOND ONE NOT BEING COVERED.  HOWEVER, THEY DID NOT REPLACE IT, THEY PLACED A COVER OVER IT.  THEIR REFUSAL TO ADDRESS THE RECALL PROPERLY AND REPLACE THE PART IS UNACCEPTABLE.  I HAVE THE CLOCK SPRING, I DEMANDED IT WHEN I WAS FORCED TO PAY FOR A REPLACEMENT THAT COST OVER $700.00.",
