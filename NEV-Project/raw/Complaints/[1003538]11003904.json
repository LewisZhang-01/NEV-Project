GAS CONSUMPTION WAS 16MPG.  AFTER SEVERAL YEARS ONE TECH LISTENED TO ME, ADJUSTED THE 'FEEDBACK' FROM ABS TO THE TRANSMISSION MODULE COMPUTER AND THE SENSATION OF BRAKED SLOWING WAS GONE! AND THE GAS  CONSUMPTION BECAME 19MPG! SEVERAL YEARS LATER MY DOOR LOCKS SHORTED OUT AND HAD TO BE REPLACED AFTER DESTROYING TWO BATTERIES. THE TECH THEN REPORTED THAT HE HAD REPROGRAMMED THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM TO 'FACTORY SPECS' AT THAT POINT THE 'SLOWING (BRAKED)' PROBLEM RECURRED AND THE GAS CONSUMPTION DROPPED BACK TO 16 MPG.
