        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING OUT OF THE CITY ON A STREET THAT CHANGES FROM 25 TO 35 MPH, I BEGIN TO ACCELERATE AND THE CAR STALLS AND THE ETC LIGHT ILLUMINATES. THEN WITH MORE FORCE ON THE PEDAL IT ONLY GOES UP TO 10 TO 15 MPH. THE CAR SHAKES AND BEGINS TO ACT WEIRD HARD TO STOP TO MAKE A TURN INTO A PARKING LOT. I'VE ALMOST WAS FORCED WHILE BRAKING TO PULLED IN FRONT OF CARS OUT OF MY CONTROL DUE TO THE JUMPING AND SHAKING OF THE CAR. I THEN LET IT TURN OFF AFTER PARKING. I SHUT OFF ALL ELECTRIC DEVICES RUNNING ON THE CAR. I THEN TURN OF THE FAN FOR AC AND HEAT. I THEN CONTACT A LOCAL INDEPENDENT MECHANIC. THE CAR WAS DRIVEN BACK WITH NO STALLING NO LIMP MODE BUT THE LIGHT WAS STILL ONE. ONCE IN THE SHOP HE RAN THE CODES ALL 4 CODES CAME ON FOR ETC BUT THE LIGHT THEN GOES OFF. THEN IT WAS CLEARED FOR A SOLID 30 MINUTES. I THEN DRIVE HOME FROM THE SHOP NO LIGHT UNTIL 5 MINUTES AFTER AND NO STALLING AT THE TIME AND PARKED MY CAR IN MY DRIVEWAY. I CALLED THE MECHANIC TO LET HIM KNOW OF THE PROBLEM HAD OCCURRED AGAIN. WORKING ON PRICE FOR ME TO REPAIR. I'VE SEEN POSTED THAT THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE AND HAPPENS RANDOMLY TO PEOPLE. I ALSO SEE THAT THE ONE PART WAS LATER UPGRADED. SUGGESTING THE ORIGINAL ETC IS FAULTY. I CONTACTED CHRYSLER AND WAS TOLD THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE AND THAT THERE IS NO RECALL CURRENTLY BUT I MAY OR MAY NOT GET A LETTER IN THE MAIL. I ASKED IF THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION OR A RECALL GOING ON AND WAS TOLD THAT SHE WOULD NOT KNOW OF THIS INFORMATION. YET THIS WAS THE RECALL NUMBER FOR CHRYSLER. I WOULD NOT DOUBT THEY WERE AWARE OF THIS AND COVERED IT UP WITH THE UPGRADED PART TO HIDE THE FACT THAT IT WAS FAULTY FROM THE BEGINNING.",
