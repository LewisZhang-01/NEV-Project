LOOKING CLOSER, I SAW THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THE METAL AROUND THAT PARTICULAR SHOCK MOUNT HAD RUSTED AND CRACKED, AND THE MOUNT WOULD FLEX INWARDS WHEN THE SHOCK WAS COMPRESSED. THE PROBLEM IS ONLY ON THAT WHEEL, AND IT IS A COMMON ISSUE WITH OTHER VEHICLES OF THE SAME MODEL, SO IT MUST BE A DESIGN FLAW.",
