STALLING AND FUEL LEAKS SEEM LIKE A RECALL ISSUE ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO \"DEFECTS IN MATERIALS OR  WORKMANSHIP\" AS STATED IN THE ATTACHED DOCUMENT.  I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS A NEWER PRODUCTION OF THE SAME DEFECTIVE FUEL PUMP, OR A REVISED VERSION. BUT IF IT'S THE OLD ONE, IT FEELS LIKE THEY'RE JUST  TRYING TO PUSH THE ISSUE FURTHER AWAY UNTIL IT'S FORGOTTEN. JUST LIKE THEY ATTEMPTED WITH THE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL PUMP (HPFP) FOR THE OLDER MODEL 335I (2007-2012).   PLEASE STOP THE BMW RECALL-SORRY NOT-RECALLS; IT'S CONFUSING AND IT LEAVES LARGE POPULATIONS OF DEFECTIVE VEHICLES WITH NO ACCOUNTABILITY WHATSOEVER.  THANK YOU",
