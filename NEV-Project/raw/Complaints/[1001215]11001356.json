        "summary": "I AM THE SECOND OWNER OF MY 2005 FORD F-150 XLT 5.4L 3V 4X4 CREW CAB (VIN# AVAILABLE ON REQUEST) AND THERE IS A LOUD KNOCKING NOISE COMING FROM THE ENGINE. I CAN HEAR THE NOISE WHILE IDLING IN DRIVE, IDLING IN REVERSE, IDLING IN NEUTRAL, IDLING IN PARK AND TRAVELING UNDER LOW THROTTLE AND/OR POWER IN ANY GEAR(IT IS ESPECIALLY LOUD WHEN THE ECHOES BOUNCE OFF OF A HARD-SIDED BUILDING, SUCH AS A DRIVE-THROUGH RESTAURANT). THE EVENTS LEADING TO MY BREAKDOWN ON A BUSY ACCELERATION RAMP ARE AS FOLLOWS: MY VEHICLE LOST ALMOST ALL POWER ON AN ACCELERATION RAMP, SLOWING ME DOWN TO A CRAWL. IT ALSO CAUSED MASSIVE OIL LEAKING FROM THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT, WHICH RESULTED IN ROAD SPILLAGE, CAUSING UNSAFE DRIVING CONDITIONS FOR ME AND THE PEOPLE AROUND ME. I'VE DONE SOME INDEPENDENT RESEARCH AND HAVE PERSONALLY HAD THIS ISSUE FIXED ONCE. I'VE HAD IT FIXED AT A MECHANIC, THE RESULTING REPAIR COSTS ENDED UP BEING ~$3500. FULL DIAGNOSTIC AND REPAIR RECEIPT IS AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST, BUT THE MAIN ISSUES WERE THE CAM PHASER, AND TIMING CHAIN. I HAVE SEEN MULTIPLE UPON MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS ISSUE, AND I AM FORMALLY REQUESTING THE NHSTA TO INVESTIGATE AND HOLD THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY (HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS \"FORD\") RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS POOR DESIGN CHOICE. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A RECALL FOR EVERY FORD F-150 REPORTED WITH THIS ISSUE, AS WELL AS REIMBURSEMENT FOR ANY DOCUMENTED REPAIRS CONDUCTED BY MECHANICS FROM FORD. THIS MAY BE AN OUTLANDISH REQUEST THAT MAY NOT EVEN BE IN THE NHSTA'S CUMULATIVE POWER, BUT, AS A TAXPAYER, A WORKING MAN, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, A HUSBAND, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ACTION TAKEN BY THE PEOPLE I PUT MY FAITH IN, TO RECTIFY THIS SITUATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, AND GOOD DAY.",
