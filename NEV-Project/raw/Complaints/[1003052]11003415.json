        "summary": "WE WERE DRIVING DOWN A 35 MPH RD..I SLOWLY BEGAN TO BRAKE AS WE WERE APPROACHING A STOP LIGHT WHEN THE BRAKES DID NOT HOLD, I HIT THE BRAKE HARDER, THE CAR BEGAN TO BUCK FORWARD, I HIT THE BRAKE AS HARD AS POSSIBLE BUT THE BRAKES FAILED TO HOLD AND ONLY  STOPPED WHEN IT HIT THE CAR IN FRONT OF US.  THE POLICE CAME AND AN ACCIDENT REPORT WAS MADE. I DESCRIBED THE BRAKE FAILURE TO THE OFFICER BUT THEY ONLY SEEMED INTERESTED IN WRITING UP THE ACCIDENT REPORT.  WE HAD THE CAR TOWED TO OUR BODY SHOP AS WE WERE AFRAID TO DRIVE IN CASE THE BRAKES FAILED AGAIN.  OUR INSURANCE COMPANY WAS MADE AWARE OF THE ACCIDENT AND BRAKE FAILURE AND A TASK FORCE IS LOOKING INTO IT.  WHEN WE RETURNED HOME WE LOOKED UP THE POSSIBLE PROBLEM WITH BRAKES FAILING ON THE YEAR AND MODEL OF MY CAR. WE IMMEDIATE FOUND THREE ARTICLES LISTING MY EXACT CAR HAVING \"RESTRICTED OIL SUPPLY FROM THE INTAKE CAMSHAFT TO THE BRAKE VACUUM PUMP,WHICH MAY CAUSE THE BRAKE VACUUM PUMP TO FAIL, RESULTING IN A LOSS OF POWER BRAKE ASSIST.\"  IT ALSO SAID IN THE ARTICLE,  BIMMERFEST, THAT BMW NOTIFIED NHTSA  OF ITS INTENTION TO VOLUNTARILY RECALL MORE THAN 75,000 3 SERIES CARS DUE TO A POSSIBLE LOSS OF POWER BRAKE ASSIST THAT COULD RESULT IN THE VEHICLES FAILING TO STOP.  A MANDATORY RECALL WAS NEVER ISSUED AND SO THIS PROBLEM STILL EXISTS.  THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT OCCURRED WHEN TRYING TO STOP OUR CAR.    WE HAVE REPORTED THE PROBLEM TO OUR INSURANCE CO AND BMW CORPORATE.  WE ARE AWAITING AN ANSWER AND SOLUTION REGARDING OUR BRAKE ISSUE AND HOPE BMW WILL FINALLY REALIZE THERE IS A MAJOR PROBLEM AND WILL ADDRESS IT PROPERLY.    AS OF NOW I WILL NOT DRIVE MY 2014 328I XDRIVE SEDAN UNTIL I AM COMFORTABLE THAT BMW CORRECTS THE ISSUE TO MY SATISFACTION AND SAFETY.",
