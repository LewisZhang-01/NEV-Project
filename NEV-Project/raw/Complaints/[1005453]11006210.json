I HAVE READ ON SEVERAL ONLINE FORUMS HOW SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HAVING THE SAME ISSUE AND HOW THIS MEANS THAT THE AIRBAG WILL NOT DEPLOY DURING A COLLISION. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE AND THE DEALERSHIPS SHOULD BE CHARGING OVER $250 TO CORRECT THIS DEFECT. I HAVE NOT YET BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT, BUT I DON'T WANT TO WAIT UNTIL THEN FOR SOMEONE TO TAKE ACTION. THANK YOU.",
