NORMALLY I'M THE ONLY DRIVER OF THIS VEHICLE, MIRACULOUSLY MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING AND WAS ABLE TO MANUALLY STEER US HOME. IF THIS FAULT HAD OCCURRED WHEN I WAS DRIVING, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT. IT'S A KNOWN ISSUE WITH FORD, THEY FOUGHT MANY LEGAL BATTLES OVER IT, IN MY VIN DOES NOT FALL UNDER THEIR RECALL. THEY HAVE AN FIELD SERVICE ACTION FOR MY VIN, BUT IT EXPIRES AT A HUNDRED AND 150000 MILES. I WAS LESS THAN 4000 MILES OVER THAT WHEN MINE FAILED. THIS SHOULD BE AN ACROSS-THE-BOARD RECALL FOR ALL FORD EPAS SYSTEMS FOR THE AFFECTED YEARS, AS THEY SEEM TO BE AWARE THAT IT IS AN INEVITABLE FAILURE.",
