        "summary": "A COUPLE WEEKS AGO MY CAR STALLED AND TOTALLY SHUT DOWN AS I WAS TURNING INTO MY DRIVEWAY. IT COMPLETELY LOCKED UP INCLUDING THE BRAKES, STEERING, TRANSMISSION AND WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING. I TRIED TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK HOWEVER THE CONTROL KNOB TO DO SO WAS LOCKED AND WOULDN'T MOVE. THE ENGINE WAS SHUT DOWN BUT ALL THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS WERE WORKING AND SEVERAL SERVICE MESSAGES CYCLED THROUGH THE DISPLAY SCREEN. MY HUSBAND HAD TO DISCONNECT THE BATTERY, WHICH RESET EVERYTHING AND ALLOWED US TO START THE CAR AND PULL IT OUT OF THE ROAD AND INTO THE DRIVEWAY. I CALLED CHRYSLER ROADSIDE AND MY CAR WAS TOWED TO THE CHRYSLER DEALERSHIP. AFTER 3 DAYS IN THE SERVICE DEPT I WAS INFORMED THEY COULD NOT RECREATE THE ISSUE THAT CAUSED THE CAR TO TOTALLY SHUT DOWN AND LOCK UP WHILE DRIVING. THEY DROVE THE CAR, HOWEVER NO CODES WERE ACTIVE AND THEY WERE UNABLE TO GET THE CAR TO THROW A CODE WHILE THEY HAD THE VEHICLE. THEY HAVE NOW RETURNED MY CAR TO ME WITHOUT THIS MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE BEING ADDRESSED. SINCE THEY COULD NOT RECREATE THE STALLING AND SHUTDOWN THEY RETURNED THE CAR TO ME. LUCKILY THIS HAPPENED AS I WAS TURNING INTO MY DRIVEWAY AS OPPOSED TO A FEW MINUTES EARLIER WHEN I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY SURROUNDED BY OTHER VEHICLES. I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN AND NEXT TIME I MAY NOT BE AS LUCKY. I LEASED THE CAR BRAND NEW IN AUG. 2014, THE LEASE ENDS AUG. 2017.",
