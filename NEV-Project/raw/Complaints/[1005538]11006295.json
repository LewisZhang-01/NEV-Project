REPLACED THE SENSORS IN ALL TIRES AND WENT TO DEALER TO RESET THEM, DEALER CHARGED $100 AND SAID I HAD A BAD SENSOR, WANTED EXTRA $80 TO REPLACE NEW SENSOR. I TOOK IT TO TIRE DEALER AND THEY SAID SENSORS WERE WORKING, BUT COULD NOT PROGRAM THE TPMS. EMAILED SCHROEDER WITH NO REPLIES ABOUT VALVE SAFELY PROBLEM. NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW HOW TO RESET A TPMS SAFETY ISSUE, SO I DO NOT HAVE A FLAT TIRE ACCIDENT. I THOUGHT THAT SAFETY COMES FIRST, WITHOUT NEEDING A LOAN TO FIX ISSUE.
