THE OIL WAS CHANGED 5 MONTHS PRIOR TO THIS PROBLEM AND THE DEALER CLAIMED THE OIL FILTER WAS PUT ON TO TIGHT WHICH CAUSED CRACKS IN THE HOUSING AND WOULD NOT COMPLETE THE WORK UNDER WARRENTY.     AFTER THE REPAIR I REQUESTED TO KEEP THE PART THAT WAS TAKEN OUT. AFTER CLOSE EXAMINATION AND USING COMPRESSED AIR TO SEE IF I COULD FIND A CRACK THERE WAS CRACK TO BE FOUND. ONLY THING I COULD SEE THAT COULD CAUSE A LEAK WAS A MISSING GASKET ON BOTTON OF HOUSE.",
