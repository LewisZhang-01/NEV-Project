THIS IS A DEFECT AS A SIMPLE GOOGLE SEARCH WILL SHOW HOW PREVALENT THIS ISSUE AS THERE ARE FORUMS AND YOUTUBE VIDEOS WITH CONSUMERS COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS ISSUE WITH THIS CAR. EVEN WHEN I WAS AT THE DEALER THERE WAS ANOTHER PATRON THERE WITH THIS CAR, COMPLAINT AND DIAGNOSIS. THIS IS NOT A NORMAL WEAR AND TEAR ISSUE IT IS A MATERIAL DEFECT BY THE MANUFACTURER THAT SHOULD BE RECALLED AS IT IS SO COMMON. PLEASE ASSIST.  THIS MAY NOT SEEM LIKE THE SAME CONCERN AS AN AIRBAG BUT IT IS AN ISSUE AS IT ALLOWS THE CONSUMER TO BE VULNERABLE TRYING TO GET THEIR KEY IT OF THE IGNITION AND IN MOST CASES FAILING TO BE ABLE TO DO SO AND NEEDING TO EITHER LEAVE THE VEHICLE,  HAVE IT TOWED AND POSSIBLY DEPENDING ON WHERE THIS HAPPENS BEING VULNERABLE. I WAS PARKED AT A GAS STATION AT NIGHT, ANYTHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED WHILE I WAS FIDGETING WITH THIS KEY AND UNABLE TO GET IT TO RELEASE.",
