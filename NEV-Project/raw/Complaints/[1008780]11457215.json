        "summary": "Traveling with my family my vehicle just completely gave out at high speeds on the highway. I managed to safely navigate to the shoulder and wait in the freezing cold for a tow. Initially I was told the issue was due to lack of maintenance but upon further investigation it was uncovered that this was an unaddressed recall issue. The engine threw a rod bearing and caused damage to the rod, engine, battery, and spark plugs causing all to be replaced. There were no indications of what was about to happen prior to it happening. Thank God there weren\u2019t more people on the road or that we weren\u2019t in a different area.",
