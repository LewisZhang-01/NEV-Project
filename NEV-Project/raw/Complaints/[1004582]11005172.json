I ALL WAYS CHECK MY AND RESET MY TRIP ODOMETER AND KNOW WHEN I NEED TO REFUEL BUT MY FUEL GAUGE DOES NOT MATCH WHAT MY TRIP ODOMETER IS READING. I WENT ONLINE AND CHECKED TO FIND OUT IF THERE WAS A RECALL ON THIS PROBLEM AND DISCOVERED THAT THERE IS A SAFETY RECALL ON 340,000 2005 TITANS BUT NOT FOR MINE. NOT SURE WHY SOME 2005 TITANS ARE IN THE RECALL BUT NOT ALL EVEN THOUGH MANY MORE HAVE THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM. SEEMS TO ME A SAFETY RECALL SHOULD BE FOR ALL AFFECTED VEHICLES AND NOT JUST SOME. MINE AND MY FAMILIES SAFETY SHOULD BE JUST AS IMPORTANT TO NSSAN.",
