THE MANUAL OVERRIDE WORKS BUT NOT THE TRAIL BREAKS. IF YOU SWITCH TO ELECTRIC OVER HYDRAULIC THE BREAKS GRAB AND ARE UNSAFE. ALSO THE VEHICLE COMES STANDARD WITH A TOWING PACKAGE BUT TOWING MIRRORS ARE OPTIONAL. A VERY EXPENSIVE OPTION. WHEN INSTALLED ON THE TUNDRA PLATINUM YOU LOOSE ALL OTHER SAFETY FUNCTIONS OF THE STANDARD PLATINUM MIRRORS. YOU LOOSE THE OUTBOARD CLEARANCE LIGHTS, THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR, THE AUTOMATIC DIMING FUNCTION, THE MEMORY FUNCTION AND THE PUDDLE LAMPS. THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED WITH TOYOTA. ALL OF THESE ARE SAFETY ITEMS.",
