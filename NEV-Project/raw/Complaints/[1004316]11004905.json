WHILE DRIVING ON A STREET TRAVELING AROUND 30 MPH I RECEIVED NO WARNING AND MY BEGAN TO SHUT DOWN. ALL OF THE LIGHTS BEGAN TURNING ON AND OFF, THE WIPERS TURNED ON, AND THEN MY CAR COMPLETELY SHUT OFF. THIS CAUSED ME TO NEARLY HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE AND INJURE MYSELF. THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN AND SOMEONE COULD BE HURT.",
