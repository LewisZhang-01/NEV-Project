THE COMPUTER CAUSES THE TEMP GAUGE, FUEL GAUGE TO STOP WORKING, THE TC LIGHT & ANTITHEFT LIGHTS TO COME ON, AND THE KEY BEING STUCK IN THE IGNITION. IT RENDERS THE CAR UNDRIVEABLE BECAUSE THE TEMP & FUEL GAUGES STOP WORKING. I HAVE RESEARCHED THIS AND THERE HAS BEEN THE EXACT SAME ISSUE WITH THOUSANDS OF CARS!!! WHEN I CONTACTED CADILLAC ABOUT THIS THEY SAID I WOULD HAVE TO PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS FOR A DIAGNOSES FEE. I TOLD THEM THAT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A DEFECT WITH POOR DESIGN AND/OR BAD PARTS. I HAVE INCLUDED JUST ONE OF MANY LINKS THAT OWNERS HAVE HAD WITH THIS MODEL OF CAR. THIS MODEL NEEDS TO BE RECALLED AND CADILLAC NEEDS TO FIX THIS ONGOING PROBLEM!!    HTTP://WWW.TOPIX.COM/FORUM/AUTOS/CADILLAC-CTS/T0O6TKB3DQGANK509/P3    THIS IS SO WRONG THAT THEY HAVE RECEIVED THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS FOR THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM I MENTIONED ABOVE AND HAVE DONE NOTHING TO FIX IT!!!!",
