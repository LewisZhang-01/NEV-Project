THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR A WHILE AND NO ONE CAN FIND A LEAK BUT CAN SMELL THE GAS ODOR STRONG. I PURCHASED A NEW GAS CAP AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROBLEM BUT THAT DIDN'T HELP EITHER. I SEE THERE WAS A RECALL THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE ISSUE I AM HAVING BUT THE DEALERS TELL ME THAT SINCE I AM NOT IN THE STATES LISTED I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY TO FIX MYSELF; WHICH I CAN NOT AFFORD AND IS MY ONLY TRANSPORTATION FOR MYSELF AND MY 2 1 YEAR OLD GRANDCHILDREN. I NEED HELP PLEASE",
