I KNOW THE 2005  JEEP CHEROKEES WERE RECALLED FOR HAVING THE VERY SAME ISSUE FROM THE MANY MECHANICS WHO HAVE DRIVEN MY CAR TO SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS. ONE OF THE MECHANICS WHERE I TOOK IT TO WAS CHRYSLER JEEP IN ASHEVILLE, N.C. THE MECHANIC SAID THAT I DID HAVE A 2005 TRANSMISSION WHICH HAD BEEN ON YOUR RECALL LIST.
