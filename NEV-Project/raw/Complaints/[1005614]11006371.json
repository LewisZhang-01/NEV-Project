        "summary": "I BOUGHT THE GMC ACADIA USED IN 2014. IT HAD ABOUT 80K MILES ON IT, FROM A DEALERSHIP. THEY ASSURED ME IT HAS BEEN INSPECTED AND I HAD AN EXTENDED WARRANTY ON IT. THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT WITH MY 5 CHILDREN IN THE CAR ON THE FREEWAY.  I'M A SPECIAL ED TEACHER AND DRIVE ONLY 5 MILES FROM MY HOME AND OCCASIONALLY TO LOS ANGELES TO VISIT RELATIVES. AFTER 3 WEEKS OF HAVING THE CAR, THE TRANSMISSION WENT OUT. I WAS HORRIFIED!!! THE WARRANTY COVERED THE MAJORITY OF THE PARTS. BUT THEY CHARGED ALMOST $4000 FOR A TRANSMISSION THAT THEY TOLD ME WOULD BE NEW, I FOUND OUT LATER THAT IT WAS REBUILT WITH NEW PARTS. FAST FORWARD TO 3 YEARS LATER, THE WATER PUMP, THE FUEL PUMP, THE AXLE AND THE TRANSMISSION AND COMPUTER HAS WENT OUT AGAIN. ANOTHER ALMOST $4000, THIS TIME IT HAS TO COME OUT OF MY POCKET AS THE WARRANTY IS EXPIRED. IT IS BLEEDING ME DRY. I HAVE THE CAR SERVICED REGULARLY AND KEEP ALL OF MY SERVICE RECORDS, THIS MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE. AS A PARENT OF 5 CHILDREN, (2 SPECIAL NEEDS), I WAS EXCITED ABOUT MY PURCHASE, NOW I WISH I WOULD'VE NEVER DONE IT.  --",
