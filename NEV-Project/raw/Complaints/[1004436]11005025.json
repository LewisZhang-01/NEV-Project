THE SPRINGS KEEP BREAKING, AND THE VISORS WILL NOT STAY UP NOR WILL THEY STAY ALL THE WAY DOWN.  THEREFORE, IT IS OBSTRUCTING MY VISIBILITY WHILE DRIVING.  I HAVE NEVER DRIVEN WITH MY VISORS DOWN.  THE ONLY REASON I EVER PUT THEM DOWN IS WHEN I PUT A THIN LITTLE SHADE IN THE WINDSHIELD WHILE AT WORK. OF ALL THE VEHICLES I HAVE EVER OWNED, I HAVE NEVER HAD TO REPLACE VISORS, MUCH LESS 3 TIMES.",
