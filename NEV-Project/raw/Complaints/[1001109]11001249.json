THE BRAKES FEEL NORMAL, BUT RECENTLY I DID NOTICE SOME AUDIBLE NOISES WHEN I USE THE BRAKES. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THEY SAID THE BRAKE ACTUATOR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED FOR AROUND 3200 W/ LABOR. AFTER DOING SOME RESEARCH, I FOUND THAT THIS SAME SYSTEM WAS RECALLED ON THE CAMRY HYBRID BUT NOT THE HIGHLANDER HYBRID, DESPITE MANY COMPLAINTS.IF THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT, IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS ONE THAT COULD CAUSE BRAKE FAILURE AND LEAD TO DEATH",
