        "summary": "I OWN A 2012 CHEVY MALIBU. I BOUGHT IT NEW 5 YEARS AGO. I HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH THE CHECK ENGINE AND ESC LIGHTS COMING ON SINCE SHORTLY AFTER BUYING THE CAR BRAND NEW AND WAS TOLD BY THE DEALERSHIP NOTHING WAS WRONG. NOW, 5 YEARS LATER, THE ESC LIGHT COMES ON AND THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT AND THE TRACTION CONTROL LIGHT. I WAS TOLD I NEEDED A $300 THROTTLE BODY, WHICH I GOT, BUT THAT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. SIX TRIPS TO 3 DIFFERENT GM DEALERS I AND $1500 POORER AND BEING TOLD \"THERE IS NOTHING WRONG\" THE CAR RUNS SO BADLY I FINALLY PARKED IT IN THE DRIVEWAY, AND THERE IT SITS. THERE HAS BEEN MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS REGARDING THIS ISSUE WITH CHEVY MALIBUS IN THE 2000S. I PERSONALLY KNOW SEVERAL MALIBU OWNERS THAT HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS. THIS IS DANGEROUS BECAUSE THE CAR STALLS AND SHUTS OFF WHILE DRIVING. THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL WITH AS MANY COMPLAINTS THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD REGARDING THIS ISSUE. ALSO, WHILE SITTING AT A STOP SIGN OR STOP LIGHT, OR AS I AM APPLYING THE BRAKE TO SLOW DOWN, THE CAR WILL CONTINUOUSLY JERK, THE ENGINE SURGES AND THE VEHICLE TRIES TO TAKE OFF ON ITS OWN. THIS IS VERY DANGEROUS.",
