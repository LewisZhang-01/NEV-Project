AFTER TURNING LEFT IN FRONT OF ANOTHER CAR GOING 60 MPH, I WAS UNABLE TO CORRECT MYSELF AND TOOK MY HANDS OFF THE WHEEL, FEEL OFF THE PEDALS, CLOSED MY EYES AND WAITED FOR THE OTHER VEHICLE TO STRIKE ME. I WAS WEARING SUNGLASSES AT THE TIME. EVERY AIR BAG INSIDE MY VEHICLE WAS DEPLOYED INCLUDING THE DRIVER REAR HEADREST BAG, USUALLY INDICATING A DEATH. I AM CERTAIN THE AIRBAGS AND SEATBELT SAVED MY LIFE. I AM STILL PULLING OUT PARTICLES OF DEBRIS FROM MY FACE AND LEFT FINGER, BUT AM THANKFUL TO BE ALIVE. I AM ALSO CERTAIN THAT TAKING MY HANDS OFF THE STEERING WHEEL, FEET OFF THE PEDALS, CLOSING MY EYES AND ROLLING SLOWLY INTO THE COLLISION ALSO SAVED ME. IF POSSIBLE MAYBE DIAL DOWN ON THE EXPLOSIVES, IF ANY COMPLAINT,  BUT I WAS A BEE TO WALK AWAY FROM A POTENTIALLY FATAL ACCIDENT. IT DID FEEL AS THOUGH A BOMB WENT OFF, AND NEITHER CAR HAD AN ENGINE, HOOD, FENDERS, ETC. LEFT BUT BOTH OF US WALKED AWAY. JULY 24, 2014. MULHOLLAND HWY AND LAS VIGENES AT 12:00 NOON, MALIBU, CA. SO MANY AGENCIES WERE ON THE SCENE SOMEONE MUST HAVE FILMED IT. THANK YOU TAKATA INFLATORS FOR SAVING MY LIFE.",
