SHE DID NOT DARE ASK A STRANGER, SO I TOLD HER TO WAIT AND I WOULD BE RIGHT THERE. SHE WAS VERY UPSET BY THE TIME I GOT THERE.-20 MIN. THE DOOR OPENED NORMALLY FROM THE OUTSIDE. LATER I TOOK THE DOOR APART AND FOUND THAT A PLASTIC PART OF THE HANDLE THAT TRANSFERS MOTION TO THE DOOR LATCH HAD BROKEN. THIS SEEMS LIKE A POOR DESIGN AND/ OR A POOR CHOICE OF MATERIAL. IN A DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCE OR LOCATION THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A LIFE THREATENING EVENT. I BELIEVE THE DESIGN OR MATERIAL SHOULD BE CHANGED BEFORE SOMEONE IS INJURED OR WORSE KILLED.",
