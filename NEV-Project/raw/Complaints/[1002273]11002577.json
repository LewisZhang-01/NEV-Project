MY CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND MY CAR IMMEDIATELY STOPPED IN THE ROAD. I HAD TO BE TOWED WHERE I WAS TOLD I HAVE P0463 AND MY CAR WAS OUT OF GAS. I WAS TOLD THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH. ISSA XTERRA. I WENT TO DEALER TO GET IT REPLACED AND THEY SAID $700. I SEE THAT THIS IS TOO COMMON AN ISSUE.  I THINK THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DEFECT. I'M JUST HAPP HAPPY I WASN'T DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN IT STOPPED. LUCKILY I WAS ON SIDE ROAD.",
