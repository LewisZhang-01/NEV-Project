        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE AT 75 MPH (POSTED SPEED LIMIT IN TEXAS), CROSSED ONTO A BRIDGE AND THE ENTIRE FRONT END BEGAN TO VIOLENTLY SHAKE AND BOUNCE. THE STEERING WHEEL WAS TURNING BACK AND FORTH.  THE ONLY WAY I COULD GAIN CONTROL OF THE TRUCK WAS TO SLOW DOWN AND MOVE OVER TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER AND ALMOST STOP. THIS WAS ALMOST 10 DAYS AGO ON A SATURDAY. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP ON THE FOLLOWING MONDAY.  COINCIDENTIALLY, THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN THERE WITH A 2018 F250 WITH THE SAME ISSUE.   MY TRUCK IS  A 2019 AND HAS 16,600 MILES ON IT.  I'VE TAKEN IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AND THE TECH TOLD ME THAT FORD HAS KNOWN ABOUT THE ISSUE FOR A LONG TIME.  HE SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED THE DEGREE OF CAMBER IN THE FRONT END.  THEY'VE ORDERED PARTS AND HE STATED THAT HE HAS PERSONALLY REPAIRED OVER A HUNDRED TRUCKS WITH THIS PROBLEM.  HE STATED THAT HE WILL \"REPLACE THE PARTS AND READJUST THE DEGREE OF CAMBER BACK TO WHERE HE LIKES IT\" AND \"THAT SHOULD FIX THE PROBLEM\".  TONIGHT, NOV 10, 2019, AS I'M DRIVING TO WORK, IT HAPPENED AGAIN ON LEVEL GROUND ON AN ENTRANCE RAMP TO THE INTERSTATE AT APPROXIMATELY 50 MPH.  I HAD TO SLOW DOWN TO APPROX 25 MPH TO GET THE SHAKING AND OSCILLATIONS TO STOP.",
