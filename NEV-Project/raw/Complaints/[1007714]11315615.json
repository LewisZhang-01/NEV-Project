THE CAR SHUTTERS UPON ACCELERATING. IT IS UNSAFE TO DRIVE AS STATED IN THE RECALL. I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT WARRANTY IS EXPIRED. THIS HAS BEEN A LAWSUIT BEFORE AND I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE WARRANTY THAT I HAD PREVIOUSLY WHEN FIXING THE FORD SHOULD APPLY THIS TIME AS WELL. MY CAR IS CURRENTLY IN A FORD DEALERSHIP WAITING TO GET FIXED, BUT I DO NEED THE CLEAR THAT WARRANTY WILL COVER IT SINCE THIS IS THE THIRD TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED.  I SHOULD BE ABLE TO RELY ON MY CAR AND NOT BE WORRIED IF IT WILL START.",
