        "summary": "ON WEDNESDAY 1/30/2019 MY DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING NORTH ON I-17 ENTERING FLAGSTAFF WHEN THE TRANSMISSION STOPPED WORKING.  THE ENGINE WAS REVING TO ABOUT 6000 RPM BUT THE CAR WOULD ONLY GO ABOUT 5 MPH.  SHE MANAGED TO GET THE CAR TO A PARKING LOT AND CALL ME FOR HELP.  AFTER ABOUT 30 MINUTES THE TRANSMISSION COOLED DOWN AND WORKED NORMALLY.  I HAD HER TAKE THE CAR TO A LOCAL SHOP AND HAVE IT CHECKED OUT.  THEY GOT A CODE P0776.  THEY CONTACTED NISSAN AND FOUND THE CAR TO BE UNDER AN EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT I PURCHASED UNTIL 100,000 MILES.  MY DAUGHTER DROVE HOME THE NEXT DAY AND WE TOOK IT INTO PINNACLE NISSAN WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR.  THEY COULD NOT GET THE CODE TO COME UP SO ARE UNABLE TO FIX THE TRANSMISSION.  THIS IS ABOUT THE TENTH TIME THAT THE TRANSMISSION HAS SLIPPED, THIS BEING THE MOST SEVERE.  PINNACLE NISSAN AND NISSAN USA ARE TELLING ME TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE UNTIL THE WARNING LIGHT COMES ON, THEN BRING THE VEHICLE IN FOR A TRANSMISSION REPLACEMENT.  I TOLD THEM BOTH THAT THE WARNING LIGHT HAS NEVER COME ON WHEN THE TRANSMISSION SLIPS, SO COULD THERE BE A PROBLEM WITH THE CARS COMPUTER ALSO WHICH IS WHY THEY CAN NOT GET A CODE TO COME UP?  THEY SAID NO, THAT IS NOT HAPPENING?",
