I HAVE TAKEN IT TO A SHOP TO GET A DIAGNOSIS AND THEY SAID THAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE RECALL FOR THE GAS TANK. WELL, I LOOKED UP TO SEE IF MY CAR HAD ALREADY GOTTEN FIX FOR THE RECALL AND IT SAID THAT IT DID. SO IT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED AGAIN, AND I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO DO. IT HAPPENS EVERY SO OFTEN. AS THE ENGINE LIGHT ALSO COMES ON AND OFF. WHEN THE LIGHT IS OFF, THE CAR IS PERFECTLY FINE, BUT WHEN IT'S ON, IT TRIES TO STALL.  *TR",
