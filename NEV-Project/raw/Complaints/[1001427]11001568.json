NOW VW SERVICE DEALERSHIP IN SALINAS SAID THERE IS NO RECALL ON MY CAR EVEN THOUGH WWW.SAFERGOV STILL SHOWS AN INCOMPLETE RECALL. NOW MY HORN STOPPED WORKING,THE AIRBAG LIGHT IS LIT ON THE DASHBOARD AND MY STEERING WHEEL IS MAKING NOISES WHEN I'M STEERING. THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION. I CAN'T HONK AS WARNING AND I DON'T THINK THE AIRBAG WILL DEPLOY AND IF IT DOES IT CAN CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH.",
