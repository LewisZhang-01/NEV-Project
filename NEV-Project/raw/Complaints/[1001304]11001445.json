SHE REGAINED CONTROL AND BROUGHT THE CAR TO A SAFE STOP. SHE CALLED ME FOR ASSISTANCE AND I FOUND THE REAR SUB FRAME IS INFERIOR IN CONSTRUCTION AND HAD EXTENSIVE PERFORATION INCONSISTENT WITH THE REST OF THE VEHICLE. THIS CAUSED THE REAR CONTROL ARM TO SEPARATE FROM THE SUB FRAME. THE REAR WHEEL BECAME UNSTABLE CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO LOSE CONTROL.  I HAVE CONTACTED FORD ON THE ISSUE, THEY HAVE RECALLS ON THE ESCAPE AND WINDSTAR FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.  I HAVE ALSO FOUND THE SAME REPORTS FROM OTHER FREESTYLE OWNERS. FORD REFUSED TO ASSIST ON THE MATTER. THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE. THIS OCCURRED AT RELATIVELY LOW SPEED APPROX. 35 MILES PER OUR. HAD THIS OCCURRED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS MY DAUGHTER MAY HAVE BEEN INJURED OR KILLED.",
