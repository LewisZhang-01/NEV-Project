THE CONTACT STATED WHILE DRIVING AT 55 MPH AND STARTING TO FALL ASLEEP BEHIND THE WHEEL, THE VEHICLE VEERED TO THE LEFT TO AVOID CRASHING INTO A TREE BUT WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL WAS PRESSED IT FAILED TO STOP THE VEHICLE. AS A RESULT, THE CONTACT CRASHED INTO A TREE. THE AIR BAGS DID NOT DEPLOY. THE CONTACT (DRIVER) SUSTAINED CHEST, HEAD, AND A FRACTURED STERNUM INJURIES WHEN HE HIT THE STEERING WHEEL AND HIS GIRLFRIEND (FRONT PASSENGER) SUSTAINED A BACK INJURIES. BOTH INJURIES REQUESTED MEDICAL ATTENTION. A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DRIVABLE. THE VEHICLE WAS TOWED VIA FLATBED TO IMPOUND LOT. THE VEHICLE WAS DESTROYED. THE VEHICLE WAS NOT DIAGNOSED.  A DEALER WAS NOT CONTACTED. THE MANUFACTURER WAS NOT BEEN INFORMED OF FAILURE. THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 20,000. *TT *JB  CONSUMER STATED I'M VERY SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT TRAVELERS INSURANCE COMPANY JUST TOWED AND DESTROYED THE VEHICLE WHEN I EXPRESSLY TOLD THEM THAT THE AIRBAGS DID NOT DEPLOY AND  THAT THE MEDICAL BENEFITS WERE MAXED OUT. I THOUGHT FOR SURE THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES DISSECTED VEHICLES IN SUCH MAJOR ACCIDENTS AND BEING NOTIFIED BY THE OWNER THAT THE EQUIPMENT WAS FAULTY THAT THEY DID NOT DO A POST MORTEM. MY GIRLFRIEND GOT A BROKEN BACK IN THE INJURY, HAD TO HAVE SURGERY AND WILL MOST LIKELY BE IN PAIN FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. I COULD NOT WORK OR LIFT ANYTHING OVER 6 MONTHS UNTIL MY STERNUM HEALED ITSELF AND HAD TO LIVE THROUGH PAIN WHILE I HEALED. I STILL FEEL A SMALL FEELING IN MY CHEST.*JB",
