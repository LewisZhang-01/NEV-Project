        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY THE TRUCK SHIFTED FROM 5TH GEAR TO 1ST GEAR... THE WHEELS SEEMED TO HAVE LOCKED UP AS WE DID LEAVE A SKID MARK ON THE HIGHWAY.  NEARLY SENT US THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD... THANK GOODNESS FOR SEAT BELTS.   WRENCH SYMBOL APPEARED ON THE CONSOLE.   PULLED OVER... TURNED OFF VECHICLE, TURNED BACK ON AND SHOWED IN 1ST GEAR.. STARTED DRIVING AND WOULD NOT SHIFT OUT OF FIRST GEAR AND WRENCH REAPPEARED... POWERED OFF AGAIN AND BACK ON WRENCH DISAPPEARED... SEEMED TO DRIVE NORMAL AFTER A COUPLE MILES WRENCH APPEARED AGAIN AND WE HAD NO GAUGES ON THE DASHBOARD OPERATIONAL EXCEPT RPM.   DEALERSHIP PERFORMED RECALL 19S07 FOR THIS KNOWN ISSUE... ON TEST DRIVE IT WAS STILL NOT RESOLVED SO THEY SAID THEY NEEDED TO DO 19N01 BUT THAT THIS WAS ONLY ALLOWED AS A WARRANTY REPAIR UP TO 150000 MILES.   I HAD 151866 WHEN BROUGHT TO THE DEALERSHIP.   SO I NOW HAVE AN UNSAFE TRUCK WITH A KNOWN RECALL ISSUE THAT FORD WILL NOT REPAIR BECAUSE I HAD 1866 MILES MORE THAN THEIR WARRANTY.   THEY WANT 800 FOR ME TO FIX IT MYSELF WHICH I MUST DO AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THIS WILL FIX THE ISSUE.   FORD SHOULD BE OBLIGATED TO FIX ISSUES TIED TO KNOWN SAFETY PROBLEMS WITH THE VEHICLE.  WHO KNOWS NEXT TIME IT DOES IT SOMEONE COULD REAR END ME AND BE SERIOUSLY INJURED.",
