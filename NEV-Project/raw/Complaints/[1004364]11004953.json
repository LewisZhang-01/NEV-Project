THE TIRE PRESSURE SYSTEM CAUSED A BLOWOUT AND THE CAR WOULD ACCELERATE WHEN I HIT THE BRAKES.  WE HAD TAKEN IT IN PREVIOUSLY FOR THE SHAKING AND THEY NEVER TOLD US WHAT CAUSED IT.  TOOK IT TO ANOTHER REPAIR SHOP & THEY TOLD US WHEN THE TIPM MALFUNCTIONS THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR EMULATE WHAT THE COMPUTER SAYS IS WRONG.         CHRYSLER KNEW THIS BUT THEY WERE TRYING TO GET IS TO PAY MONEY FOR REPAIRS THEY KNOW WOULD NOT FIX OUR CAR AND THEN THEY SENT THE POLICE OUT TO OUR HOUSE TO GET THEIR LOANER CAR EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD THE AUTO CLAIM NUMBER AND DIRECT BILLING FROM OUR INSURANCE COMPANY.         ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS PARKED ON THE STREET AND AS I WAS MAKING THE TURN THE CAR SPED UP ON ITS OWN AND CAUSED ME TO HIT THEIR CAR",
