THE TIRES ARE 5 YEARS OLD AND  THE TREAD WAS MEASURED AT 6/32 ON 6-15-17 AT THE DEALER DURING ROUTINE SERVICE.  THE PRESSURE WAS SET AT 65 PSI AT THE SAME TIME WHICH IS THE MANUFACTURE SPEC.  THE TREAD COMING OFF CAUSED APPROXIMATELY $1300 DAMAGE TO MY FENDER (NOT INCLUDING THE TIRE COST).  THANKFULLY, THERE WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT SINCE I WAS THE ONLY CAR ON THE ROAD.  I DID NOT HIT ANYTHING OR RUN OVER ANYTHING WHEN THE TIRE EXPLODED.",
