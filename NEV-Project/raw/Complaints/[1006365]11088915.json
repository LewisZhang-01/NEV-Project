I ENDED UP JUMPING THE PARKING SPACE \"CURB/STOPPER\" AND HIT A LIGHT POST.  I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS PRIOR BUT IT WAS EXTREMELY FRIGHTENING.  I HAVE HAD OTHER ISSUES WITH THE CAR -  THE RADIO WHERE WORKS INTERMITTENTLY AND THE VOLUME SPORADICALLY INCREASES AND DECREASES WITH NO RESOLUTION EVEN AFTER DIAGNOSTICS AND SOFTWARE UPDATES PER THE DEALER.  THIS, HOWEVER, WAS AN ISSUE THAT COULD HAVE HAD WORSE CONSEQUENCES.  AFTER THE COSMETIC DAMAGE IS FIXED, I PLAN TO HAVE MERCEDES RUN DIAGNOSTICS ON THE BRAKE SYSTEM.",
