COST TO REPLACE $+4000.  2003-2010 ALTIMA CVT OWNERS COMPLAINED ABOUT CVT TRANSMISSIONS AND GRANTED COMPLETE REIMBURSEMENT COVERAGE...5 YEARS/60,000 MILES CHANGED TO 10 YEARS/120,000 MILES.   NISSAN CUSTOMER SERVICE DENIED $ SUPPORT FOR MY 2011 ALTIMA NOR WOULD THEY TELL ME WHETHER I HAD THE SAME CVT THAT THE 2010 MODEL HAD...IF IT WAS THE SAME  CVT SHOULD I NOT BE GRANTED THE SAME COVERAGE/? THE CVT I HAD ENDANGERED MY LIFE WITHOUT ANY WARNING! A REVIEW OF OTHER DRIVERS AND LAW SUITS SUGGESTS THAT CVT IS A DANGER TO MORE THAN MYSELF. NISSAN HAS NOT RELEASED INFORMATION TO ME OR OTHER DRIVERS (ONE INTERNET ARTICLE STATED THAT A NISSAN CEO SAID THERE WERE NO CHANGES MADE??)",
