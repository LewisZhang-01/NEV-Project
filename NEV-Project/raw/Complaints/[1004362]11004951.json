I FIRST NOTICED MINE SEVERAL DAYS AFTER PURCHASING MINE IN OCTOBER 2016. IT HAS TAKEN OVER 9 MONTHS WITH GM/CADILLAC CORPORATE INVOLVEMENT TO FINALLY FIND MY 5TH REPLACEMENT DASH THAT DOES NOT HAVE DEFECTIVE LEATHER! THE DEALERSHIP SHOWED ME A BRAND NEW XT5 PLATINUM ON THEIR SHOWROOM FLOOR WITH BUBBLED PREMIUM LEATHER DASH. IT IS ONLY AFFECTING THE XT5 PLATINUM MODELS BECAUSE THE LEATHER IS DIFFERENT. IT IS APPARENTLY A NATIONAL ISSUE.",
