        "summary": "1. I believe it's the \"Auto Start-Stop\" feature in the vehicle  2. While at a stoplight in a busy intersection, my vehicle has stopped twice, putting my children and myself in danger, making it a high risk for a serious accident with other motorists. This vehicle has also had a minor stall while driving on the highway. Luckily it didn't completely shut off but gave us a minor jerk.  3. Not at this time; the dealer has requested to test drive the vehicle for up to 200 miles to recreate the scenario. I don't believe 200 miles will recreate the scenario, especially when they say it could be the vehicle oil consumption.  Since the first time we took it in, they lowered the recommended oil change by 3k or 4k instead of the original 5k. While in the care of the dealership on (6/15/2021) they made an oil change, so I am sure they will not encounter anything in this 200-mile test drive.  4. Yes, this is the second time the dealership has inspected the vehicle's issue with no response to why the dealership mechanics can't fix the issue. When will the manufacture take responsibility and recall the 2019 Jeep Compass. Why put people's lives at risk when informing the dealership of the dangers of this vehicle.  5. The Jeep Compass displayed no warning lamps; the vehicle just stalled.",
