Both times I was about 5 feet away from an overhead traffic light.  After June 2021 incident I brought the car to the dealer, who replaced the distance sensor.  This braking happened in September 2021, have not yet contacted the dealer This also occurred once in 2020 however I thought it was a fluke. This seems to be an ongoing and potentially not fixable issue. I am afraid to drive my Rogue.",
