I TOOK IT TO MECHANIC FIRST TIME HE TIGHTENED A BATTERY WIRE. IT DID START BACK UP BUT DIED GOING DOWN THE ROAD AND TOWED IT BACK. HE THEN TIGHTENED WIRE ON IGNITION MODULE. IT STARTED AND RAN A FEW DAYS AND DID IT AGAIN. IT NOW DID IT A THIRD TIME. IT THROWS NO CODES ON THE CAR SO IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE. I HAVE SEEN NUMEROUS OTHER PEOPLE HAVE THIS PROBLEM.
