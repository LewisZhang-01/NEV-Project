DOES NOT HAPPEN ALL THE TIME, MOSTLY WHEN THE ENGINE IS AT FULL OPERATING TEMPERATURE. SOMETIMES THE RESISTANCE IS STRONG WHERE IT CAN CAUSE YOU TO FIGHT IT AND OVER CORRECT. I CAN HERE A CLUNKING SOUND THROUGH THE STEERING WHEEL THAT ORIGINATES AT POWER STEERING MOTOR. THIS CLUNKING DOES NOT HAPPEN WHEN THE ENGINE IS COLD, ONLY WHEN THE ENGINE IS HOT AND WHEN I'M EXPERIENCING THIS PROBLEM. *TT  UPDATED 9/20/18*JB",
