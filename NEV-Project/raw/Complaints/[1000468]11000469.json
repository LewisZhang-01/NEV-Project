        "summary": "ON DEC 18TH DRIVING ON A COUNTY ROAD OUTSIDE OF GUNNISON, CO MY 2013 HYUNDAI SANTA FE SPORT WAS IN MOTION AND A CLICKING NOISE BEGAN IN ENGINE. AFTER ~1 HR AND AFTER CHECKING FLUID LEVELS A LOUD POP IN THE ENGINE CAUSED IT TO CEASE FUNCTIONING WHILE IN MOTION (~45-55 MPH) LEAVING MY STRANDED IN DANGEROUSLY COLD TEMPERATURES THAT NIGHT. I WAS FORCED TO HAVE THE VEHICLE TOWED TO DEALERSHIP WHERE, WITH NO LOANER CARS AND A 6 WEEK WAIT ON A NEW ENGINE, WAS FORCED TO PURCHASE ANOTHER VEHICLE FROM HYUNDAI WITH NO EXPLANATION OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ENGINE. A FEW WEEKS AGO I RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM HYUNDAI CORPORATE STATING THERE IS A KNOWN PROBLEM AND A SAFETY RECALL (NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 17V-226). IT IS CLEAR THAT HYUNDAI KNEW OF THIS PROBLEM AND NOT ONLY DID NOT REIMBURSE ANY EXPENSES RELATED TO THE ENGINE ISSUE AND PUT ME IN A SITUATION REQUIRING ME TO PURCHASE ANOTHER VEHICLE FROM THEM.",
