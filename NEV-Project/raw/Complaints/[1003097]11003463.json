HAD THE BATTERY CHECKED AT 8 OTHER PLACES, THEY ALL SAID BATTERY WAS FINE. HE HAD TESTED THE BATTERY RIGHT AFTER I TRIED TO START IT FOR TWO HOURS. WHEN YOU PULL THE NEGATIVE CABLE OFF THE BATTERY, THERE IS STILL 2 AMPS BRING DRAWN OFF THE BATTERY. WITH NOTHING ON, NO DIME LIGHT, NO RADIO, NO AIR. AND I'VE TOLD THEM FOREVER THAT MY SEATBELT WARNING SIGNS DON'T WORK PROPERLY. BUT THEY CAN'T SEEM TO REPRODUCE ANY PROBLEMS.",
