        "summary": "AT 19000 MILES I EXPERIENCED A VIOLENT SHAKE IN MY STEERING WHEEL WHILE DRIVING AT 75MPH ON A LOCAL EXPRESSWAY. THIS VIOLENT SHAKE MADE ME LOSE CONTROL OF ANY STEERING OF THE VEHICLE TIL I SLOWED DOWN TO I BELIEVE WAS 40MPH WERE I GAINED CONTROL OF VEHICLE AGAIN. THIS ALMOST CAUSED ME TO CRASH INTO ANOTHER LANE AND VEHICLE AND IT ALMOST CAUSED THE DRIVER BEHIND ME TO REAR END ME DUE TO THE SUDDEN STOPPING ON A EXPRESSWAY. I HAVE TAKEN THE VEHICLE TO THE FORD DEALER 5 TIMES FOR REPAIR. THE TRUCK CONTINUES TO HAVE STEERING CONTROL ISSUES. I WILL ATTACH THE LATEST RECEIPT SHOWING REPAIR THAT HAS NOT FIXED THE ISSUE. THIS ISSUE HAPPENED AGAIN TODAY BUT LUCKILY IT WAS NOT AS BAD. PLEASE HELP FIX THIS ISSUE BEFORE SOMEONE GETS KILLED.",
