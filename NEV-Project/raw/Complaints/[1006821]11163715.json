THEY STATED \"THIS MUST BE A RECURRING PROBLEM WITH THIS MAKE/MODEL CAR.\"  THIS, AFTER BEING TOLD THAT I MUST REPLACE TWO TIRES DUE TO EXCESSIVE WEAR.  I HAD REPLACED ALL FOUR TIRES @ 34,520 MILES, AND NOW AT 58,867 I WAS NEEDING TO REPLACE TWO TIRES AGAIN.  THEY SAID THAT BECAUSE OF THE TOE, I WAS ESSENTIALLY DRAGGING MY REAR TIRES CAUSING EXCESSIVE WEAR AND TEAR.  NOT TO MENTION REDUCING GAS MILEAGE.  THIS APPEARS TO BE A MANUFACTURING ISSUE AFTER LOOKING ON-LINE AT WHETHER OR NOT OTHER'S ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME ISSUE.  PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS.",
