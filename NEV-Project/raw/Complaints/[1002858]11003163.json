        "summary": "ABNORMAL NOISE AND VIBRATION IN RIGHT REAR WHEEL AS VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION. TOYOTA DEALER IDENTIFIED RIGHT WHEEL BEARING AS DEFECTIVE AND REPLACED IN MAY 2017. DEALERSHIP HAD PROBLEMS REPLACING BEARING AND ALSO CONTACTED TOYOTA CORPORATE TO SEE IF REPAIR COULD BE COVERED-TOYOTA REFUSED TO COVER THE ISSUE. THE REPLACED BEARING FAILED AGAIN IN JUNE 2017 WITH A CLICKING SOUND WHICH INCREASED WITH SPEED.  DEALERSHIP IS REPLACING RIGHT REAR BEARING UNDER THEIR WARRANTY. I REPORTED PROBLEMS TO TOYOTA CONSUMER ADVOCATE WHO ADVISED ME THAT THERE IS NO RECOURSE OR ESCALATION SINCE THEY HAD NO RECALLS, SERVICE BULLETINS OR WARRANTY COVERAGE DOCUMENTED. I PROVIDED NHTSA COMPLAINTS AND EVENTUALLY I LOCATED TSB T-SB-0151-10 TO TOYOTA CORP. MY CONCERN IS THAT A BEARING FAILURE CAN RESULT IN A LOSS OF STEERING CONTROL OR WHEEL SEPARATION FROM THE VEHICLE. I HAVE NO ASSURANCE FROM EITHER TOYOTA OR THE TOYOTA DEALER THAT THE REMAINING 3 BEARINGS ARE FREE OF THE SAME DEFECT OR THAT THE NEW REPLACEMENT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. WEB SEARCHES HAVE INDICATED THAT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED BY OTHER PARTIES AND GENERALLY UNSUPPORTED BY TOYOTA.",
