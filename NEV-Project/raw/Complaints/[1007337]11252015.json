UPON GOING TO THE DEALERSHIP TO FIND THE PROBLEM, WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WILL COST OVER $800 TO REPAIR THE SEATBELT AIRBAG CONNECTIONS!  SEARCHING ONLINE I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A SERVICE BULLETIN THAT WAS ISSUED BACK IN 2015, BUT IT DOES NOT SEEM THAT A RECALL HAS BEEN ISSUED.  THIS SEEMS LIKE A PROBLEM THAT IS BEING EXPERIENCED BY MANY VEHICLES AND I WANTED TO POINT IT OUT TO BE CONSIDERED FOR A RECALL.    FORD EXPLORER 2014-2016: BULLETIN INFORMATION INVOLVING VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH SECOND ROW INFLATABLE SEAT BELTS MAY EXHIBIT AN AIRBAG WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED WITH DTC B141B AND B141C.",
