ON MY VEHICLE IT DOES NOT SEEM TO MATTER WHAT THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE IS.  THIS THEN INVOLVES ME SITTING AT THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY, WHICH IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN.  DEALERS DO NOT OR WILL NOT SAY THERE IS A PROBLEM AFTER CHECKING THE DIAGNOSTICS, WHEN IT IS PLAINLY EVIDENT BASED ON A WEALTH OF INTERNET SITES TIS IS A COMMON PROBLEM WITH THE CVT TRANSMISSION, PARTICULARLY IN A JEEP PATRIOT.  THIS ISSUE IS HAPPENING WITH MORE FREQUENT OCCURRENCES AS TIME GOES ON.  MY ISSUES STARTED AT 2500 MILES,  I AM AT 86,500 NOW.  I CAN SAY THAT THE ISSUE HAS NEVER STARTED WHILE DRIVING ON CITY STREETS, ONLY HAPPENS AT 60+ WITH AS LOW AS 2500 RPM INDICATED ON THE TACHOMETER.",
