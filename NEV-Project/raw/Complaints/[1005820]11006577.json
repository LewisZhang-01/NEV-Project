AFTER MANY PHONE CALLS, OFTEN DAILY, THERE IS NO RESOLUTION.  KIA KEEPS CONTACTING THE DEALER, WHO KEEPS SAYING THEY DO NOT HAVE THE TOOL.  WE HAVE REQUESTED A LOANER CAR UNTIL THE REPAIR CAN OCCUR.  WE HAVE BEEN DENIED.  TODAY I WAS TOLD THEY WILL CONTACT ME BY NEXT THURSDAY (7/27/17) WITH A RESPONSE.  TO DATE IT IS ONE MONTH SINCE WE FIRST TRIED TO GET THE RECALL REPAIR COMPLETED.  WE DO RESIDE IN TEXAS AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE RECALL IS RELATED TO PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO SALT.  WE BOUGHT THE VEHICLE IN OHIO AND DROVE IT THERE FOR ALMOST 4 YEARS BEFORE MOVING TO TEXAS.  THERE IS SOME VIBRATION AT HIGHER SPEEDS, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE RELATED TO THE RECALL.  WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL THE INSPECTION IS DONE.  WE FEEL THIS VEHICLE MAY BE UNSAFE TO DRIVE.  ATTACHED ARE THE NOTES FROM CONVERSATIONS WITH KIA.  I APOLOGIZE THAT THEY MAY BE DIFFICULT TO READ, BUT WE HAD NO IDEA THEY WOULD BE NEEDED.",
