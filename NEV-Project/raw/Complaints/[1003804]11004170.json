SOON THEREAFTER I CONTACTED THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE REP. WHO TOLD ME A LOCAL DEALERSHIP WOULD CONDUCT A TEMPORARY FIX BY DISCONNECTING THE FRONT PASSENGER AIR BAG, SO IT WOULD NOT GO OFF IN THE EVENT OF A CRASH. THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD NOT PERFORM THIS BECAUSE IT WAS A LIABILITY ISSUE FOR THEM. THEREFORE, GM OFFERED ME GRAVELY INACCURATE INFORMATION ABOUT THE \"FIX\" THAT COULD BE PERFORMED. GM DID NOT OFFER A RENTAL CAR/LOAN CAR FOR AN \"UNDISCLOSED REASON TOLD TO THEM BY PONTIAC HUMAN RESOURCES.\" MY CAR MAY NOT BE COMPLETELY FIXED UNTIL 2023, WHICH I FIND TO BE EXTREMELY RIDICULOUS GIVEN THE SEVERITY OF THE ISSUE.",
