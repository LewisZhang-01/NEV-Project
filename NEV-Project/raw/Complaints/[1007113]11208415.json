        "summary": "MY 2011 FORD EXPLORER HAS ABOUT 89000 MILES ON IT. TWICE RECENTLY THE POWER STEERING HAS GONE OUT AND IT HAS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE TO STEER THE CAR. BOTH TIMES THIS HAS BEEN WHILE THE CAR IS NOT MOVING.  IT WAS CLEARED BY TURNING OFF THE ENGINE AND RESTARTING THE CAR. THE LOCAL FORD DEALERSHIP SAYS THEY CAN NOT FIND ANYTHING WRONG AND NO ERROR CODE WAS FOUND.  WE WERE TOLD TO DRIVE THE CAR AND IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN DO NOT SHUT OFF THE ENGINE AND CALL TO HAVE THE CAR TOWED TO THE NEAREST FORD DEALERSHIP.  THIS SEEMS LIKE A VERY DANGEROUS AND LIFE THREATENING WAY TO TREAT THIS PROBLEM.  WHY CAN'T FORD OWN UP THE  PROBLEM SINCE ALL OF THESE COMPLAINTS ARE PILING UP AND NOT LEAVE US CONSUMERS AT SUCH RISK. SURELY BY NOW THEY MUST HAVE SOME IDEA WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND HOW TO FIX IT.",
