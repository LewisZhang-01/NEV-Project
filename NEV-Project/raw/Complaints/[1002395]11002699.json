SEARCH RECALLS AND FIND THAT MY VEHICLE ISN'T EFFECTED YET THERE IS A SAFETY RECALL FOR SAME VEHICLE AND ENGINE SIZE USING THE SAME EXACT SENSOR. WORKED FOR FORD FOR 20 YEARS. HOW AND WHY ARE YOU ALLOWING FOR TO LIE AS TO THE PROBLEM WITH A POTENTIAL FIRE BEING A HEAD GASKET AND NOT THE FAULTY SENSOR THAT IS HAVING TO BE REPLACED? LET ME ANSWER THAT. SO THEY DO NOT HAVE TO RECALL EVERY SINGLE CAR THAT HAS THE SENSOR WHICH IS EVERY SINGLE ONE. LET'S ADD TO THIS THE FACT THAT FORD CAN THEN CLAIM THAT EVERYONE LEFT WITH AN OVERHEATED ENGINE WITH CRACKED HEADS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAMAGE AND NOT THE SENSOR THAT INCORRECTLY ADJUST FOR THE SYSTEM PRESSURE AND INCORRECTLY READS THE TEMPS. THANKS, THANKS FOR LOOKING OUT FOR THE CONSUMER. NOW I AM LEFT WITH THE CHOICE OF PAYING OFF  7GRAND ON PRACTICALLY NEW MODEL OR REPLACE THE ENGINE...AND SENSOR OF COURSE.",
