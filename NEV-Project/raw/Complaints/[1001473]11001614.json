LIGHTS STARTED FLASHING, WINDSHIELD WIPERS TURNED ON.  I NO LONGER HAD ANY CONTROL OF THE CAR.  STEERING WHEEL LOCKED.  COULDN'T SWITCH GEARS TO PARK.  HAD TO COAST TO A STOP.  THEN CAR WOULDN'T TURN OFF AND FILLED WITH SMOKE SMELL.  I EXPECTED IT TO CATCH FIRE ANY SECOND.  AFTER 5 MINUTES I WAS ABLE TO APPROACH CAR AND GET TO TURN OFF (AFTER MANY ATTEMPTS).  TURNED OUT TO BE THE ALTERNATOR.  THERE IS A RECALL ON THE 160 VOLT ALTERNATOR AS THIS APPARENTLY HAPPENED OFTEN, HOWEVER MINE WAS A 180 VOLT ALTERNATOR SO WAS NOT COVERED.  SAME ISSUE AS THE 160 BUT NOT COVERED.  NOR WAS I AWARE THAT I HAD AN UNSAFE ALTERNATOR IN THE CAR I WAS DRIVING (WITH MY CHILD).",
