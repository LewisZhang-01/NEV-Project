I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FOR $4700 IN CASH. I RECENTLY FOUND OUT THROUGH CARFAX THAT I AM THE 4TH OWNER AND THE ODOMETER WAS PREVIOUSLY AT  186,475. MY CAR ODOMETER IS CURRENTLY READING AT 147,355 AND COUNTING BECAUSE I DRIVE THIS CAR DAILY. WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE THE BILL OF SALE DID NOT HAVE THE MILEAGE ON IT, THE BILL STATED EXEMPT.
