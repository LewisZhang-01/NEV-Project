THIS HAS HAPPENED MULTIPLE TIMES AND I BROUGHT IT TO THE SUBARU DEALERSHIP BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS STILL UNDER MANUFACTURES WARRANTY. LAST WEEK THE DEALERSHIP CALLED AND STATED IT WAS REPAIRED, I HAVE ALL THE RECORDS. AS MY PREGNANT WIFE AND I GOT INTO THE VEHICLE I STARTED THE CAR TO LEAVE AND THE STEERING LIGHT WAS ON AGAIN, AND I COULD NOT STEER THE VEHICLE. I AM NOW VERY AFRAID THIS WILL HAPPEN WHILE I AM DRIVING. I HAVE NOT CONFIDENCE IN THE CAR AND THE DEALERSHIPS ABILITY TO FIX THE ISSUE AND THE VEHICLE SITS AT THE SUBARU DEALERSHIP IN ROSEVILLE CA CURRENTLY. ON ALL OCCASIONS THE VEHICLE WAS STATIONARY, BUT THERE ARE INCIDENTS WHERE OTHER SUBARU DRIVES HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS ISSUE WHILE DRIVING. I HAVE MANY RECORDS THAT CAN BE REVIEWED.",
