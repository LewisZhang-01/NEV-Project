I CAN NOT AFFORD THIS. I AM SINGLE MOM IS THERE NOT SOMEONE THAT CAN REBUILD THEM PROPERLY ???? I BOUGHT A NISSAN BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD LAST LONGER. I HAVE NOT DRIVEN THE VAN IN 6 MONTHS ITS A TOTAL LOSS IF I SPEND THE MONEY AND IT HAPPENS AGAIN THEN I AM PUTTING GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD. IT'S NOT WORTH ANYTHING AS A DOWN PAYMENT IF I HAVE TO TOW IT IN. HAS ANYONE GOT TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS??? HOW I FOUND OUT IS THAT I TURNED ONTO A BUSY STREET PUSHED THE GAS IT WOULDNT GO. THE CAR BEHIND ME HAD TO DRIVE UPON THE CURVE ACCIDENT NARROWLY AVOIDED. THIS SUCKS",
