THIS SEEMS TO BE A REOCCURRING PROBLEM IN THIS VEHICLE, YET STILL MADE YEAR AFTER YEAR THE SAME WAY. THIS IS ALSO A COSTLY REPAIR, COSTING BETWEEN $1500 - $2000 BECAUSE THE FRAME NEEDS TO BE REMOVED TO REPAIR IN MOST CASES. NOT TO MENTION THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS THIS IS HAVING ON THE ATMOSPHERE BY LEAKING THESE CHEMICALS. (THERE IS A LOT OF RESEARCH BEHIND THIS). MY VEHICLE, NOW ONLY 3 YEARS OLD IS USELESS BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY CONCERN OF ALLOWING MY CHILDREN TO RIDE IN A CAR DURING 90 DEGREE WEATHER WITHOUT ANY COOL AIR. IT IS A HOT BOX INSIDE. EVEN WITH THE WINDOWS DOWN, YOU CAN NOT RIDE IN THE CAR FOR MORE THAN 20 MINUTES AT A TIME WITHOUT BEING SEVERELY OVERHEATED.",
