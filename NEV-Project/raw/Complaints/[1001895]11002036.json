I CONTINUE BEING TOLD IT'S TRANSMISSION ISSUE (TRANSMISSION OIL COOLER, FLUID, LINES). MY CAR SLIGHTLY JERKS INTO GET WHEN SHIFTING FROM PART TO ANOTHER GEAR, AND THE PARKING ASSIST MESSAGE FLASHES ON.  AFTER READING ALL THE SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ONLINE IT SEEMS THE ISSUE MAY BE WITH THE SHIFT MODULE.  WITH SO MANY COMPLAINTS IT WOULD BE NICE IF THIS COULD BE A RECALL AND CORRECTED.",
