AS OF MAY 2017 WHILE DRIVING 30 MPH OR 60 MPH MY GUAGES JUMP FOR EXAMPLE WILL BE DRIVING 55 MPH ON A CITY STREET AND THE GUAGE WILL JUMP DOWN TO 20 MPH. AS I AM TURNING MY STEERING LOCKS HAVE ALMOST CRASHED MULTIPLE TIMES (NEEDS RECALL FIXED) BUT TO BE CLEAR IT DOES NOT JUMP AT ALL WHILE STATIONARY. HAVING TO FEEL UNSAFE IN ANY VEHICLE SHOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE BY ANY MEANS. THIS IS MY FIRST GM CAR AND HAVING WORKED FOR GM IM HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED",
