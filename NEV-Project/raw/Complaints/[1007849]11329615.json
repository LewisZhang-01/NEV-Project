        "summary": "TRUCK LOSES POWER STEERING COMPLETELY WHILE DRIVING MAKING IT 10X HARDER TO MANEUVER THE VEHICLE MAKING TIGHT TURNS VERY DIFFICULT. LACK OF BRAKING POWER. TRUCK HAS A VERY EVIDENT AERATION NOISE EVERY TIME STEERING WHEEL IS TURNED AT ANY TIME. TRUCKS POWER STEERING FLUID HAS FALLEN BELOW MINIMUM THREE TIMES IN THE VEHICLES LIFE. TRUCK IS AT 27,000 MILES. ISSUE BEGAN AROUND 15,000 MILES. BUBBLES IN POWER STEERING RESERVOIR. POWER STEERING PUMP SMELLS LIKE IT'S BURNING UP. POWER STEERING PUMP AND HYDRO BOOST ARE FAILING AND HAS AIRFLOW PASSING THROUGH A SYSTEM THAT CONSTANTLY NEEDS TO BE LUBRICATED BY POWER STEERING FLUID. PUMP AND HYDROBOOST WILL FAIL PREMATURELY BEFORE THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCIES. I HAVE BROUGHT MY VEHICLE INTO THREE DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS, TWICE AT ROCKWALL DODGE, TWICE AS DALLAS DODGE, ONCE AT HUFFINES DODGE. DEALERSHIPS CLAIM NOTHING IS WRONG WITH VEHICLE, THE POWER STEERING PUMP ON THIS PARTICULAR MODEL IS MORE AUDIBLE THAN OTHERS, ALSO THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE SOME AIR CREATED IN POWER STEERING SYSTEM. DEALERSHIP SERVICE ADVISOR STATED, 'FOR ALL I KNOW, YOU COULD BE SYPHONING THE FLUID OUT OF THE RESERVOIR AND CLAIMING IT'S LOW' EACH DEALERSHIP SAID NOTHING WAS WRONG, BUT HAS FAILED TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHERE MY FLUID IS GOING, WHY I'M LOSING BRAKING POWER, HAVING COMPLETE LOSS OF POWER STEERING, OR WHY MY TRUCK IS VERY AUDIBLY MAKING AN AERATION NOISE. VEHICLE HAS BEEN OUT OF SERVICE FOR 15 PLUS DAYS. DEALERSHIPS ONLY LOOK TO SEE PHYSICAL LEAKS, SEE NOTHING, AND SAY IT'S FINE AND SEND ME OUT THE DOOR. I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE LEMON LAW PROCESS. FCA WON THE CASE AND NCDS DENIED BUYBACK. I WILL ATTACH A PICTURE OF NCDS'S STATEMENT ON WHY THE DENIAL WAS MADE. DIRECT STATEMENT FROM [XXX]    INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).  *TR",
