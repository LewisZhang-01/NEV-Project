FORWARD COLLISION WARNING ACTIVATED, INITIATED THE AUTOMATIC EMERGENCY BRAKING, WITHOUT ANY OBJECTS OR TRAFFIC AROUND.  THE ACTIVATION WAS UNEXPECTED, WITHOUT ANY INDICATION OF REASON, SO MUCH SO I INSTINCTIVELY PULLED THE VEHICLE OFF THE ROAD WAY AND CAUSED DAMAGE TO THE UNDERCARRIAGE AND FRONT BUMPER.  THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE, AND HAS BEEN REPORTED TO THE MANUFACTURER AND DEALERSHIP AND WAS SCHEDULED TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT.  UNFORTUNATELY, THE SUDDEN PLUNGE OFF THE ROAD WAY ENDED WITH THE VEHICLE IN A SEVERE ANGLED DITCH AND I RAN OVER A METAL POST OR SOME OTHER OBJECTS IN THE DITCH WAY AND NOW THE VEHICLE IS INOPERABLE.",
