KIA DEALERSHIP SERVICE ADVISED THE ENGINE, ALTHOUGH IT WAS FULL OF OIL AND HAD ABSOLUTELY NO LEAKS, WAS ABOUT TO SEIZE.  THE TECH COULDN'T TELL ME WHY HE DETERMINED THAT DIAGNOSIS, SUCH AS PISTON, ROD/LIFTER, METAL SHAVINGS, BLOCK?? QUOTED  $7,000 FOR REPLACEMENT AND MORE FOR A USED ENGINE (HIGHER LABOR CHARGES).  ADVISED THAT NO ONE WOULD EVER REPLACE ENGINE IN 2013 KIA SPORTAGE; SHOULD JUST BUY A NEW KIA.  I STILL OWE NEARLY $7,000 ON THE LOAN AND HAD EXPECTATIONS OF 200,000+MILES ON A KIA. ONLINE I FOUND A RECALL FOR THE 2013 KIA SPORTAGE ENGINE FOR ENGINE SEIZING, BUT HE ASSURED ME THAT DIDN'T COVER MY 2013 KIA SPORTAGE ENGINE THAT WAS \"ABOUT TO SEIZE\", EVEN THOUGH IT IS DOING THE SAME THING. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER KIA FOR THIS REASON AND WILL JOIN THE ONLINE FORUM PETITIONING  THE NHTSA TO ISSUE AN EXPANSION OF THIS RECALL.  KIA SHOULD MAKE THIS RIGHT.",
