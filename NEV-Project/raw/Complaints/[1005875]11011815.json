        "summary": "DEFECTIVE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE BODY CAUSING \"LIMP HOME\" MODE . I WAS DRIVING HOME PULLING MY CAMPER UP A LARGE BRIDGE IN MICHIGAN DURING HEAVY TRAFFIC CONDITION AND THE TRUCK WENT INTO LIMP MODE CAUSING LOSS OR POWER TO TOW THE CAMPER UP AND OVER THE BRIDGE. I ALSMOST CREATED A SERIOUS ACCIDENT WITH PEOPLE SLAMMING BRAKES BEHIND MY WHEN I WENT FROM 70 MPH TO 0 IN LESS THEN 150 FT. IT HAS SINCE HAPPENED SEVERAL MORE TIMES.  I TOOK IT TO A DEALER AND THEY KNEW  EXACTLY WHAT THE ISSUE WAS AND CHARGED ME 200.00 FOR DEDUCTIBLE ON THE REPAIR. I SEE ALL OVER THE WEB THAT THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE AND FORD IS DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT. WHEN THIS OCCURS YOU FEEL A LITTLE LAG IN THE PERFORMANCE WHEN YOU PRESS ON THE GAS PEDAL FOR A SECOND OR TWO. THE THE HILL DECENT WARNING WILL  LIGHT UP FOLLOWED BY THE TRACTION CONTROL FAIL LIGHT. THE VEHICLE WILL THEN SLOW DOWN TO UNDER 5MPH AND ENGINE WILL RE RUNNING VERY ROUGH. YOU CAN SHUT THE VEHICLE OFF AND RESTART  TO GET YOU FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD BUT AS TIMES GOES ON THIS WILL CONTINUE TO GET WORSE AND THEN HAPPEN EVERY MILE OR SO.  HERE IS A GREAT VIDEO SOMEONE DID ON THE ISSUE TO CAPTURE THE PROBLEM.     HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=CFDENHJMQ84",
