I HAVE BEEN TO DEALER MULTIPLE TIMES FOR THIS AND ADVISED THAT DODGE KNOWS AND THAT I AM TO PULL OVER AND LET IT COOL DOWN.  WE LIVE IN LAKE HAVASU CITY, AZ WHERE ITS OVER 110 DEGREE'S 3 OR MORE MONTHS OF THE YEAR.  MY WIFE WAS COMING BACK FROM ROAD TRIP ON I-40 ON JUNE 21 AND CAR WENT INTO LIMP MODE AND WOULDN'T GO 10MPH.  SHE HAD TO SIT ON SIDE ROAD FOR 30MIN FOR TRANS TO COOL BEFORE WOULD LET HER RESUME.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE LEAVING MOTORISTS STUCK IN 110+ DEGREE WEATHER ON SIDE OF THE ROAD.  I AM STILL UNDER FACTORY WARRANTY TOOK IT BACK INTO DODGE AND THEY DID FULL CHECK ON TRANS SAID ITS FINE.  I EVEN HAD TRANS FLUSHED BEFORE THE TRIP.  I UNDERSTAND NISSAN HAS SAME ISSUES WITH THE CVT TRANSMISSION AND YET BOTH COMPANY'S CONTINUE TO USE THESE TRANSMISSIONS KNOWING THE PROBLEM.",
