THE DUAL CLUTCH TRANSMISSION (DCT) HUNTS FOR CORRECT GEARS ON OCCASION CREATING HESITATIONS AND STALLING EFFECTS. SEVERAL TIMES (AS MANY AS 10+), STARTING FROM A DEAD STOP AT A LIGHT, THE CAR WILL BEGIN FORWARD PROGRESS WITH NORMAL DEPRESSION OF GAS PEDAL. POWER TO THE WHEELS WILL THEN COMPLETELY VANISH FOR MOMENTS OF TIME (1-2 SECONDS) THEN THE CAR WILL EVENTUALLY MOVE FORWARD AGAIN. I'VE ALMOST BEEN REAR ENDED TWICE DUE TO THIS. I AM LUCKY TO NOT HAVE BEEN T-BONED WHEN CROSSING NON-LIT BUSY INTERSECTIONS. TYPE OF GASOLINE USED (REGULAR OR PREMIUM), DRIVE MODES (STANDARD OR SPORT), HARD DEPRESSION OF PEDAL OR SOFT DEPRESSION OF PEDAL, NOTHING SEEMS TO COINCIDE WITH THE THESE RANDOM OCCURRENCES.   THIS IS NOT THE TYPICAL WAY A DCT SHOULD OPERATE. I HAVE DRIVEN VW DCT VEHICLES FOR YEARS AND HAVE NEVER HAD THESE EXTREMELY SCARY HESITATION MOMENTS WITH THEM.",
