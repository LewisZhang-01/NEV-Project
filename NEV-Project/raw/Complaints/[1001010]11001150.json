        "summary": "I PURCHASED MY 2004 TUNDRA FROM A SUBARU DEALER LAST SUMMER AND DID NOT REALIZE IT WAS INCLUDED IN THE MANY TRUCKS WHICH HAD PREMATURE FRAME RUST. TOYOTA ADMITTED IT WAS AN ISSUE AND STATED THAT THE PREVIOUS OWNER HAD UNDERCOATING PUT ON THE TRUCK PAID FOR BY TOYOTA, HOWEVER, CLEARLY THIS WAS INEFFECTIVE AND A TEMPORARY BAND-AID FOR INFERIOR METAL. TOYOTA STATED THAT THEY WOULD NOT DO ANYTHING TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM, AND AS A COLLEGE STUDENT, I NEED ACCESS TO A SAFE VEHICLE. I AM AFRAID TO DRIVE THIS TRUCK AS IF IT IS STRUCK BY ANOTHER VEHICLE, I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WOULD WITHSTAND THE IMPACT DUE TO SEVERE FRAME DETERIORATION. I UNDERSTAND THE TRUCK IS FROM 2004, HOWEVER, THE RUST ON THIS FRAME IS BEYOND A NORMAL RATE. MEANWHILE, I AM OUT $16,000 AND THE RUST HAS OVERTAKEN THE TRUCK GREATLY WITHIN THE PAST YEAR. TOYOTA STILL REFUSES TO HELP DESPITE MY GAS TANK NEEDING TO BE REPLACED AND MY PICTURES OF ALL OF THE DETERIORATION.    DESPITE DOING MY RESEARCH AND SEEING HOW WELL-MAINTAINED THIS TRUCK WAS, THE FRAME ITSELF HAS RUSTED BEYOND RECOGNITION AND YET, THE OTHER PARTS REMAIN RELATIVELY INTACT. THIS VEHICLE IS OTHERWISE IN EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD SHAPE AND IS AND WAS WELL-MAINTAINED. IT ONLY HAD 58,000 MILES ON IT WHEN PURCHASED AND STILL HAS LESS THAN 80,000 MILES.",
