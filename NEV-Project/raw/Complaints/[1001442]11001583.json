THE MECHANIC TOLD ME I NEEDED TO REPLACE THE BRAKE PADS, ROTORS, AND OUTER TIE RODS ON BOTH ENDS. ALL THESE PARTS WERE DANGEROUSLY WORN PREEXISTING CONDITIONS BEFORE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE IN DECEMBER 2016.  THE BRAKE REPAIR WAS DONE AT:  424 WEST HENDERSON STREET, CLEBURNE, TEXAS 76033. 817 645 7848. ON  JUNE 26, 2017  I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE FROM BRAD DEERY HONDA IN IOWA USED, AS IS. SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD TO HAVE NUMEROUS EXPENSIVE REPAIRS. THERE SHOULD BE LAWS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM DEALERSHIPS THAT SELL VEHICLES THAT ARE UNSAFE AND FALLING APART, AND REFUSING TO HELP PAY REPAIR BILLS. USED VEHICLES DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HELP UNDER THE LEMON LAWS. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE IS SOMETHING I CAN DO TO GET HELP WITH MY REPAIR BILLS ON MY VEHICLE FOR UNSAFE PREEXISTING MECHANICAL CONDITIONS.
