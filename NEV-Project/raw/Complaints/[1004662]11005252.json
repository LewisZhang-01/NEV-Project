EVEN IF I SLAMMED THE DOOR SOMETIMES THE LIGHT STILL WOULDN'T GO OFF, AND THE WARNING SIGNAL WOULD CHIME AS I DROVE. I BOUGHT THE CAR USED FROM A HONDA DEALER, AND THE SALESMAN TOLD ME IT WAS LIKELY JUST A SENSOR ISSUE, SO I IGNORED IT FOR A MONTH OR SO BEFORE TAKING IT IN TO A FORD DEALERSHIP WHEN I THOUGHT I COULD AFFORD TO HAVE IT REPAIRED. THEY DID DIAGNOSTICS ON IT AND TOLD ME IT WASN'T JUST THE SENSOR, THAT THE DOOR WAS ACTUALLY OPEN BECAUSE THE LATCH WASN'T CLOSING PROPERLY. THEY TOLD ME IF I GOT IN A WRECK MY DOOR COULD FLY OPEN, SO I LET THEM REPAIR IT. THEY REPLACED THE ENTIRE LOCK ASSEMBLY ON THE DRIVER SIDE. I HAVE ATTACHED MY INVOICE FOR RECORD OF THE REPAIRS MADE AND THE COST.",
