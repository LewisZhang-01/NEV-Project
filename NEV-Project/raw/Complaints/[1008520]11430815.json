        "summary": "Exhaust manifold leak due to both rear studs breaking on each side of the engine. This is my 3rd dodge ram with the 5.7 liter engine that has had this problem. The other vehicle years were a 2003 Ram 2500 and a 2013 Ram 1500. With as many complaints about this problem, I am surprised there hasn't been a fix and a recall. So far, I am 3 trucks each with the same issue. I would think that two exhaust manifolds leaking in the engine compartment would pose as a safety issue by breathing the fumes sucked into the cab. The dealer repaired this issue thanks to an extended warranty.",
