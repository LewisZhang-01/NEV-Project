        "summary": "CENTRAL A/C SYSTEM ALLOWS RAIN-WATER TO COME INTO THE COACH THRU THE EXTERIOR SHROUD HOUSING AND IT FLOWS/DRIPS INTO THE AIR RETURN IN THE CEILING (WHERE THERE IS ALSO ELECTRICAL/WIRING) AND THE RAIN WATER THEN RUNS TO THE AIR FILTER, SATURATES IT AND THEN DRIPS ONTO THE TOP OF THE KITCHEN CABINETS, DOWN THE WALL TO THE STOVE AND COUNTER IN THE KITCHEN.  THIS MAY RESULT IN A SAFETY ISSUE SOON DUE TO THE ELECTRICAL WIRING AT THE ENTRY LOCATION (A RETRANGLE CUTOUT ON THE ROOF WHERE THE A/C MARRIES TO THE RUBBER ROOF.  ALSO, THE EXPOSURE TO WATER WHERE I LIVE IN SW FLORIDA NOW MAY HAVE CAUSED \"MOLD\" TO BEGIN GROWING INSIDE MY WALL AND THE CEILING AND ROOF MATERIALS.  UPON TAKING RV TO A CERTIFIED DEALER, THEY FOUND A 3\" HOLD TORN AWAY UNDER THE A/C SYSTEM WITH A HOLE IN THE CENTER OF THE EXPOSED WOOD ROOF MATERIALS.  AFTER THEY PATCHED THE HOLE THE COACH WAS FOUND TO STILL LEAK WATER INSIDE THE COACH DURING A RAIN STORM.  6 WEEKS LATER AT A DIFFERENT CERTIFIED DEALER, A WATER TEST WAS PERFORMED WITH THE TECH AND OWNER PRESENT WHERE AS THE COACH IS STILL LEAKING, NOW THRU THE EXTERIOR SHROUD ALLOWING THE WATER INTRUSION INTO THE COACH.  AGAIN, THERE IS WIRING PRESENT AT THE PLACE OF ENTRY OF THE WATER.  WATER & ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS ARE A HAZARD.  COULD CAUSE A FIRE OR A ELECTRICAL SHORT TO HAPPEN  AT ANY TIME THE COACH IS IN USE.  THE COACH WAS INITIALLY PARKED IN A CAMPGROUND WHEN THE PROBLEM WAS DISCOVERED.  THE WHOLE IN THE RUBBER ROOF WAS CAUSED BY A FACTORY WORKER OR PROCESS.  THE \"SHROUD\" ISSUE SEEMS TO BE A DESIGN FLAW.  I AM UNABLE TO SNAP A PICTURE OF THE SHROUD PROBLEM DUE TO TIGHT CONFINED AREA (1\" SPACE IN THE AIR RETURNS ABOVE THE CABINETS).  ATTACHED PHOTO OF THE HOLE IN RUBBER MATERIALS.  HOWEVER THE RECTANGLE CUTOUT FOR THE A/C SHOWS THE WIRING THAT IS IN CLOSE RANGE OF THE WATER COMING INTO THE COACH THRU THIS CUTOUT.",
