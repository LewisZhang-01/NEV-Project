WHEN I'M IDLE NOTHING HAPPENS. WHEN I'M ON THE HIGHWAY IT JERKS AND STALLS A BIT. I HAVE TO ACCELERATE A LOT TO KEEP IT GOING. I'VE HAD THE BATTERY REPLACE 2 TIMES IN THE PAST 3 MONTHS - BRAND NEW. IT KEEP DRAINING MY BATTERY. THE ALTERNATOR WAS FINE. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP THEY TOLD ME THEY CAN'T READ IT IF THE LIGHTS ARE NOT ON. BUT IT ONLY COMES ON WHEN I'M DRIVING. THE LIGHTS IN THE CAR, HEADLIGHTS, AND RADIO ALL GO OUT WHILE I'M DRIVING THEN BACK ON. THE HEADLIGHTS FLICKER. I'M ABOUT TO NEED TO HAVE THE BATTERY REPLACED NOW A THIRD TIME WITH NO HELP FROM THE DEALERSHIP. MY ENGINE LIGHT IS STILL ON AND AND IT DRIVES ROUGH AND I SMELL GAS WHEN I'M DRIVING. I JUST BOUGHT THIS CAR IN AUGUST AND I'VE HAD MORE ISSUES WITH IT THAN ANY OTHER VEHICLE I'VE EVER OWNED. I'VE ONLY RECEIVED 1 RECALL FOR THE VEHICLE, I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY CHECKED BECAUSE IT'S TOO MANY ISSUES FOR A CAR THAT'S ONLY 4 YEARS OLD.",
