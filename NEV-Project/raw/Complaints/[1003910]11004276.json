THE RPS REMAINED THE SAME EVEN WITH THE FOOT OFF THE GAS PEDAL AND WITH THE BRAKES FULLY DEPRESSED.  WE DROVE THE VEHICLE OFF THE HIGHWAY WITH THE BRAKES FULLY DEPRESSED AND IT SLOWED TO ABOUT 55 ON THE OFF RAMP THEN ACCELERATED BACK TO 65 MPH.  THE HAND BRAKED HAD TO BE USED AND THE FOOTBRAKE WAS DEPRESSED TO STOP AT THE RED LIGHT. THE ENGINE CONTINUED RUNNING AT MAX RPM SO WE TURNED OFF THE VEHICLE.  THE CAR WAS TURNED BACK ON THEN THE CAR WOULD NOT IDLE IT WOULD STALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE INTERSECTION AND IT DID THAT SEVERAL TIMES TO THEN ACCELERATE AGAIN TO FULL RPM.  WE WERE A BLOCK AWAY FROM THE FORD DEALERSHIP SO WE TOOK IT IN AND THE SERVICE PERSONNEL SAW HOW IT WAS ACCELERATING AND EVEN TOLD US TO TURN IT OFF IMMEDIATELY FOR SAFETY REASONS.",
