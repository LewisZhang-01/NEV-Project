EVEN WORSE IS EVERY MANUFACTURER DOES NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO OR FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS. I HAVE NO IDEA WHEN MY AIRBAG WILL BE REPAIRED. TRY THAT IN ANOTHER INDUSTRY AND SEE HOW IT FLIES. UNBELIEVABLE THAT THIS IS SUCH A CLUSTER AND NO ONE, BUT NO ONE CARES. WHO TAKES THE LIABILITY WHEN SOMEONE ELSE IS KILLED? MERCEDES BENZ HAS NEVER EVER CONTACTED ME REGARDING THIS RECALL. I BOUGHT THE CAR USED AND THE DEALER NEVER MENTIONED THE RECALL. THIS IS OUT OF CONTROL, MEANING NO ONE ALIVE HAS ANY IDEA OR CONTROL OF WHAT IS HAPPENING. THE PROTECTION OF THE PEOPLE IS CERTAINLY NOT THE FIRST PRIORITY HERE.",
