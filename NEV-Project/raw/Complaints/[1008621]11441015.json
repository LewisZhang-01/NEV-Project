        "summary": "Passenger side sliding door makes a loud grinding sound when shut.  Often times the door won't shut completely.  Other times it will not open (i.e. it's stuck shut).  In either case it is not safe for the passengers.  They could either fall out because the door isn't shut while the vehicle is in operation.  They could also need to exit the vehicle quickly due to an accident, but be stuck because the door won't open.  This issue has been occurring for at least 4 years.  I've been waiting for the manufacture to issue a recall to fix it because my understanding is it is very expensive to fix but am taking it into the dealership next month to get it looked at.",
