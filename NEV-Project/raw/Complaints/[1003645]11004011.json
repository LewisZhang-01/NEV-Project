THE REST OF THE VEHICLE HARDLY HAS ANY RUST ON IT. THE MARINER SHARES THE SAME INNER SHEET METAL AS THE FORD ESCAPE AND THERE HAVE BEEN MANY COMPLAINTS OF THIS HAPPENING TO ESCAPES. MY VEHICLE WAS STUDIED AT A FORD INVESTIGATION ABOUT 4 YEARS AGO FOR THIS PROBLEM. I WAS TOLD THEY WERE WORKING ON A SOLUTION AND NOTHING EVER HAPPENED. THE EMPLOYEE TOLD ME THAT THE UNDERCOATING THEY USED OF THESE YEARS OF ESCAPE/MARINERS WAS FAULTY AND BROKE DOWN PREMATURELY CAUSING THE INNER FENDER EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTS. THIS IS ALSO HAPPENING ON THE DRIVER'S SIDE WHERE THE UNDERCOATING IS START TO BREAK DOWN. THIS IS NOT A CASE OF MISUSE BY THE OWNER BUT AN ACTUAL DESIGN FLAW AND A BIG SAFETY ISSUE AS THIS COULD CAUSE A LOT OF HARM. LUCKILY I HEARD THE LOUD KNOCKING FROM THE REAR END AND STOPPED DRIVING IT.",
