        "summary": "MY VEHICLE'S ENGINE SHUTS OFF ON MY WHILE DRIVING. SEEMS TO HAPPEN MOST IN HOT CLIMATE TEMPERATURES AND IN THE FIRST 15 MINUTES OF DRIVING. WHEN THE ENGINE SHUTS OFF, I START TO LOSE STEERING AND BREAKING WHICH IS A BIG CONCERN WHEN I AM HEADING TO WORK IN THE MORNING ON AN INTERSTATE HIGHWAY. SOMETIMES THE CAR WILL START UP RIGHT AWAY AFTER I HAVE PULLED CAR OVER TO SIDE OF ROADWAY. OTHER TIMES IT CAN TAKE UP TO 10 MINUTES BEFORE CAR WILL FIRE UP AFTER SEVERAL ATTEMPTS OF TURNING THE KEY OVER TO HEAR ENGINE TURNING OVER BUT NOT FIRING UP. THIS ISSUE HAS HAPPENED IN OTHER CLIMATE CONDITIONS AS WELL AND IN DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE DAY AND ON CITY STREETS AS WELL. THE MOST RECOGNIZABLE IS THE FIRST 15 MINUTES OF DRIVING AND HOT, HUMID WEATHER. I WILL PUT DOWN THE LAST DATE THIS HAPPENED WHICH HOT AND HUMID AND WAS ON JUNE 12 2017 BUT HAS HAPPENED ON OTHER DATES AS WELL. I HAD IT CHECKED OUT BY A MECHANIC AND HE CAN NOT PIN POINT THE PROBLEM AND TOLD BE TO CHECK INTO ANY RECALLS. I DID AND NO RECALLS FOR MY VEHICLE ARE NEEDED AT THIS TIME. I CAN'T AFFORD TO KEEP TAKING MY VEHICLE IN TO HAVE DIAGNOSED AND NO RESULTS OR HAVE REPAIR DONE AND ISSUE NOT FIXED YET.",
