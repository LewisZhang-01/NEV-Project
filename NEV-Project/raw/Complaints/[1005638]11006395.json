I HAD TO PULL OVER TO REALIZE MY SUNROOF HAD SHATTERED. THERE WAS NO ROCK OR ANY OTHER PIECE OF MATERIAL IN SIGHT. I BELIEVE THAT THE GLASS EXPLODED BECAUSE OF THE HEAT SINCE IT HAS BEEN HOT AND I RARELY OPEN MY MOONROOF. HAD MY MOONROOF BEEN OPENED, I WOULD HAVE BEEN HIT BY GLASS AND INJURED, POSSIBLY CRASHED. YOU CAN SEE THAT THE HOLE IS QUITE BIG, ABOUT 10 INCHES IN DIAMETER, AND THE WHOLE SECTION SEEMS TO BE INCLINED UPWARDS, MAKING ME BELIEVE THAT IT EXPLODED ON IT'S OWN FROM HEAT PRESSURE.",
