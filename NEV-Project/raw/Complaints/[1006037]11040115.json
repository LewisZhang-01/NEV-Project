I HAVE A RECALL NOTICE BUT HAVE SPENT APPROXIMATELY $6,000 ON ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS IN VAIN AND CANNOT TRUST THE CAR TO MAKE IT TO THE DEALER TO REPAIR THE AIRBAG..  THEN THERE IS THE PROBLEM OF TRUSTING THE AIRBAG IN THE TIME I DRIVE TO THE NEAREST DEALER NOT WITH STANDING THE AIR BAG PROBLEM ALONE.     IN REGARD TO THE ELECTRICAL FAILURES, I WAS NEARLY RUN OVER BY A SEMI AT FREEWAY SPEED WHEN THE ENGINE SUDDENLY STOPPED.  THE PROBLEM COMES AND GOES LIKE A GHOST IS INVOLVED AND NOBODY HAS BEEN ABLE TO PROPERLY REPAIR IT.  AT ONE MECHANICAL SHOP I LOST A WINDSHIELD AND AT ANOTHER I LOST A TAILLIGHT WITH REPLACE COST OVER $392.00.   WHAT CAN I DO WITH ALL OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERED?  I CANNOT SELL THE CAR DUE TO SAFETY CONCERNS FOR THE NEXT OWNER AND HAVE SUFFERED A LARGE DEPRECIATION.      THIS PROBLEM CAN OCCUR ANYTIME BUT MOST OFTEN WHEN GOING ACROSS A SPEED BUMP OR UPON A ROUGH STREET.  IT HAS HAPPENED MANY TIMES OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. THE DATE I GIVE BELOW IS BEST GUESS.",
