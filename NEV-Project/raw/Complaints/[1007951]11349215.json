I HAD TO BE PUSHED OUT OF THE ROAD INTO THE CUMBERLAND FARMS THAT WAS TO THE LEFT FRONT OF ME. MY CAR WOULD START UP BUT THERE WAS NO POWER WHEN YOU PRESSED GAS IN DRIVE. IT WOULD TURN ON BUT WOULDN'T DRIVE. I HAD IT SENT TO NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND THEY CONFIRMED THE TRANSMISSION HAD FAILED DUE TO CVT ISSUES THE BELT AND IT WOULD COST ESTIMATE OF  $3500 TO REPLACE. I EMPTIED MY SAVINGS AND BOUGHT A NEW CAR. I STILL OWN MY NISSAN BECAUSE IT HAS LESS THAN 120K AND IS IN MINT CONDITION EXPECT THE TRANSMISSION FAILURE. I PAID FOR TOES AND RENTALS WHILE MY CAR WAS SERVICED AT NISSAN AS WELL.",
