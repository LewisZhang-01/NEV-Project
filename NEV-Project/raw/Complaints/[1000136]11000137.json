LATER THAT AFTERNOON THE CAR STARTED KNOCKING AND THEN THE OIL LIGHT STARTED PULSING AND THEN THE CAR JUST STOPPED AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS.  HAD TO LIMP IT TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER AND WAIT 2.5+ HOURS TO GET A TOW TO THE DEALERSHIP.  101,846 MILES.  I'VE HAD TO REPLACE THE STARTER AND FIX THE STEERING ISSUE AT MY COST.  I MAINTAIN MY VEHICLES PER FACTORY SPEC AND TAKE THEM TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIRS.  (I HAVE A FORD RANGER WITH 240,000 MILES ON IT!).    DEALER HAS INFORMED ME THAT THE ENGINE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED OR REBUILT.  THE 2.4L ENGINE IS NOTORIOUS FOR THIS FAILURE PATTERN.",
