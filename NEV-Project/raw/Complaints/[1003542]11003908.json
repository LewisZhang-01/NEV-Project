OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A LATENT DEFECT IN THE TENSIONER SYSTEM OF THE TIMING CHAIN THAT CAN CAUSE THE CHAIN TO &#147;JUMP A TOOTH&#148; IN THE VEHICLE&#146;S CAMSHAFT, WHICH CAUSES SERIOUS AND SOMETIMES FATAL DAMAGE TO THE ENGINE. UNFORTUNATELY THE DEFECT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR CAR OWNERS TO DISCOVER, BUT AUDI AND VOLKSWAGEN KNEW OF THE TENSIONER SYSTEM PROBLEM SINCE AT LEAST JUNE 2010. NORMALLY, THE TIMING CHAIN IS MEANT TO FUNCTION PERFECTLY FOR AT LEAST 120,000 MILES. BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS NOT ON THE SCHEDULE FOR RECOMMENDED MAINTENANCE FROM THE MANUFACTURERS. HOWEVER, WITH THE DEFECTIVE TENSIONER, THE TIMING CHAIN FREQUENTLY FAILS WELL BEFORE THAT MARK, BUT OFTEN AFTER THE WARRANTY HAS EXPIRED. THIS ISSUE CAUSED MY ENGINE TO HAVE CATASTROPHIC ENGINE FAILURE.    WHY HAS THE VW OWNERS NOT BEEN NOTIFIED AND WHY HASN'T THE NTSB DONE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS. 7K+ TO GET A NEW ENGINE. THIS IS AN INTERNAL PART AND NOT A SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE ISSUE.VW SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. PEOPLE DON'T HAVE MONEY TO PURCHASE A CAR AND HAVE THE ENGINE FAIL BEFORE CAR IS PAID FOR.",
