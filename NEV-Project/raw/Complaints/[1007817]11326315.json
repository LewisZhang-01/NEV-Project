AFTER HAVING IT DIAGNOSED AT OUR GM DEALER I NEED TO HAVE THE OIL ISSUE REPAIRED. I REPLACED PISTONS,RINGS,TIMING CHAIN,WATER PUMP, AND SPENT $3532.13. I MISSED A RECALL BY JUST A FEW WEEKS. THIS IS VERY DISAPPOINTING AS THIS IS NOW MY 3RD BUT POSSIBLY MY LAST EQUINOX. I WANT GM TO HONOR THIS . II PURCHASED THIS SUV ON 6/22/2019.*JB",
