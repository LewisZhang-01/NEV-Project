I WAS ABLE TO FORCEFULLY TURN THE STEERING WHEEL TO AVOID GOING INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC. DON'T BELIEVE MY WIFE WOULD HAVE HAD THE SAME RESULTS. TOOK VEHICLE TO FORD DEALERSHIP TO BE LOOKED AT. $1600.00 LATER TO REPLACE THE RACK AND PINION STEERING UNIT WHICH INCLUDES THE POWER STEERING ASSIST MECHANISM. I WAS LUCKY TO NOT GET INTO A CRASH.
