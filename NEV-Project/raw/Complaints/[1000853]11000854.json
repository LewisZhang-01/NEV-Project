TODAY, I TOOK MY VEHICLE TO PEP BOYS AUTO PARTS  IN EL PASO, TX AND THEY DIAGNOSED THE VEHICLE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE STARTER.  THE MECHANIC TOLD ME THAT I NEED TO CHANGE THE STARTER BECAUSE IT IS WEARING OUT AND IS A RARITY BECAUSE IT IS NOT SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN TO A HONDA ACCORD THAT IS ONLY 3 + YEARS OLD.  I HAVE A 2011 CHEVROLET TAHOE AND ALL ENGINE PARTS ARE OPERATING NORMALLY. UNBELIEVEABLE THAT MY HONDA ACCORD IS BREAKING DOWN ON ME.  PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS AND LET ME KNOW IF THERE IS A RECALL.",
