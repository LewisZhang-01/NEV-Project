IT WAS OPEN AND WE WERE LOADING UP THE BACK AREA WHEN THE HATCHBACK SUSPENSION FAILED AND THE DOOR CAME DOWN. THIS TRAPPED THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS STANDING UNDER IT AND IT TOOK ANOTHER PERSON TO HELP GET IT OFF THEM. IT WAS TAKEN TO THE MECHANIC WHO INFORMED US THE SHOCK WAS BAD AND THAT THERE WERE RECALLS FOR THIS ISSUE. HOWEVER IT SEEMS NOT THE 2013 VERSION WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE THE SAME ISSUE AS THE RECALLED ONE.",
