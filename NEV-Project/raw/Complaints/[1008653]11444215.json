This would also happen while decelerating and then (without braking) accelerating (stop and go traffic or at signal). One time my car started shaking (think going on your brake and gas and brake and gas) that motion but way faster.  it seems the fill cap/dipstick keeps popping out every 1000 miles and i have to manually put it back in.",
