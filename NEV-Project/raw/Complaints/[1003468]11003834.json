IT OCCURRED TO ME ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS (JULY 2016 SALINA, KS AND 6/17/17 ON I-44 OKLA TURNPIKE NEAR CLAREMORE.  BOTH TIMES I WAS GOING ABOUT 70 MPH, CRUISE CONTROL WAS ON AND THE A/C.  COULDN'T RESTART THE CAR.  HAD IT TOWED TO TULSA DEALERSHIP.  MECHANIC SAID IT WAS BAD/DIRTY GASOLINE.  THE TORQUE CONVERTER ON THE CVT TRANSMISSIONS APPARENTLY MAY ALSO BE A CAUSE.  FORBES MAG RECENTLY DID A ARTICLE ON THIS PROBLEM.  MY CAR YEAR/MODEL WAS INCLUDED IN THE ARTICLE, WHICH ALSO MENTIONED THAT FEDERAL REGULATORS HAVE RECEIVED 100 COMPLAINTS FROM CONSUMERS.  I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL RECEIVE A LETTER FROM SUBARU OR WHAT MY NEXT STEP IS.  I PLAN ON SHOWING THE FORBES ARTICLE TO MY LOCAL DEALERSHIP, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL FORCE ANY ACTION.",
