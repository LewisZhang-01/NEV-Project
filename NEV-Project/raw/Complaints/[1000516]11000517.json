        "summary": "WHEN IN MOTION AS WELL AS WHEN STOPPED, THE BRAKE PEDAL BECOMES SOFT AND I HAVE TO PRESS THE PEDAL DOWN TO THE FLOOR TO FULLY ENGAGE BRAKES. IT IS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL DECELERATION BECAUSE THE PEDAL RESISTANCE CHANGES IN THE MIDDLE OF BRAKING, OFTEN INCREASING THE STOPPING DISTANCE.   WHEN IN MOTION AND DECELERATING, THE BRAKE PEDAL RESISTANCE WILL SUDDENLY BECOME SOFTER AND THE CAR WILL STOP DECELERATING UNLESS I PRESS THE PEDAL IN FARTHER.  WHEN STOPPED WITH MY FOOT ON THE PEDAL, THE BRAKES WILL BECOME SOFT AND THE CAR WILL BEGIN TO ROLL FORWARD UNINTENTIONALLY. I HAVE TO PRESS THE PEDAL ALL THE WAY TO THE FLOOR TO KEEP THE CAR FROM ROLLING FORWARD.  THIS ISSUE WORRIES ME WHEN I AM DRIVING IN AREAS WITH MANY STOP SIGNS AND TRAFFIC LIGHTS.",
