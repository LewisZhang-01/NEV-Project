Hyundai Motors America keep sending interim notices only, so I brought my SUV to Hyundai dealership at Dublin last 4/2020. The one of mechanic informed me that he couldn't provide recall services since there are no remedy yet. I think it should be enough time to get remedy but they just don't care about customer's safety at all. Thank you",
