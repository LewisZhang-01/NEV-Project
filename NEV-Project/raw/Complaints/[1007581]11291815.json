        "summary": "WAS NOTIFIED BY MERCEDES BENZ THAT MY VEHICLE WAS INCLUDED IN THE TAKATA AIRBAG RECALL AND THAT REPLACEMENT PARTS WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL DEC 2018. SINCE IT WAS THE ONLY VEHICLE I OWNED AND I HAD TO CONTINUE WORK I DROVE THE VEHICLE WITH DEFECTIVE PARTS UNTIL I WAS INVOLVED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT IN JULY 2018. I AM NOW DISABLED AFTER A LENGTHY HOSPITAL & REHAB STAY AND HAD TO SEVERAL SURGERIES IN ORDER TO WALK/LIMP AGAIN IN 2019. I WAS HIT ALMOST HEAD ON AND WAS OKAY UNTIL THE AIRBAG DEPLOYED AND I FELT A SHARP BURNING SENSATION IN MY LOWER EXTREMITIES AND COULD NOT MOVE AFTERWARDS. EMS PULLED ME OUT OF MY CAR AND I WAS ADMITTED TO HOSPITALICU. I AM UNABLE TO FULLY FUNCTION WITH MY MOBILITY, LOST MY JOB, CANNOT DRIVE DUE TO NERVE DAMAGE TO MY ANKLE, LEG AND HIP AND CURRENTLY RECEIVING DISABILITY PAY. THE COMPANY THAT TOWED MY TOTALED MERCEDES BENZ NOTED THAT THE  AIRBAG WAS IN \"POOR CONDITION\".   I JUST REALIZED AFTER MANY MONTHS OF MEDICATION AND PAIN THAT I HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING ELSE FROM MERCEDES BENZ IN REGARDS TO THIS MATTER AND WOULD LIKE TO JOIN ANY CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT THAT IS AVAILABLE IN REGARDS TO THIS MATTER, AS I SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN SOLD THIS VEHICLE IN 2016 WITHOUT THIS MATTER BEING DISCLOSED!!!*DT  *TR",
