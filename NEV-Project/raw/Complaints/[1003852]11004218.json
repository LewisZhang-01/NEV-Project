        "summary": "ON THE HIGHWAY GOING AN A 1.5 HOUR TRIP THE 2008-2010 ROUGE TRANSMISSION WILL OVER HEAT CAUSING THE VEHICLE TO GO INTO \"LIMP\" MODE WITH NO WARNING WHICH MEANS IT HAS NO POWER.  NISSAN SENT OUT A SERVICE BULLETIN TO THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENTS IN SEPTEMBER 2016 ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR IS A DEFECT AND THE FIX IS AN EXTERNAL COOLER BUT THEY REFUSE TO FIX MY CAR.  IF A FAMILY OF 4 IS IN THE CAR AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR  THE VEHICLE COULD GO INTO \"LIMP\" MODE AND WHEN THEY TRY TO PULL BACK ONTO THE HIGHWAY THEY COULD LOSE POWER RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY AND GET STRUCK BY ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND BE KILLED.  WHO WOULD ANSWER FOR THAT? FLETCHER NISSAN IN JOPLIN MO ARE THE ONES WHO TOLD ME TO CONTACT YOU BECAUSE NISSAN CORPORATE ARE THE ONES REFUSING TO FIX THE ISSUE.  IT HAS HAPPENED TO MY FAMILY SEVERAL TIMES IN OUR CAR. AT FIRST THEY SAID WE JUST NEEDED THE TRANSMISSION FLUSHED. WE BOUGHT THE CAR WITH 10000 MILES ON IT AND IT HAS BEEN DOING IT EVER SINCE WE HAVE HAD IT. LUCKILY I KNEW WHAT TO LOOK FOR AND KEPT MY FAMILY OUT OF HARMS WAY.  JOSH HOUCHIN THE SERVICE MGR. AT FLETCHER NISSAN SAID THEY HAVE HAD 5 2008-2010 ROUGE VEHICLES COME IN IN JUST THE LAST FEW MONTHS WITH THE SAME DEFECT. SO IT IS NOT JUST MY VEHICLE. THEY NEED TO RECALL ALL THE AFFECTED VEHICLES BEFORE SOMEONE DIES BECAUSE OF THIS.  THANK YOU",
