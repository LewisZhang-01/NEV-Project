I LET THE CAR SIT FOR 30 SECONDS AND RESTARTED THE CAR. I TOOK IT TO GET LOOKED AT BY 2 DIFFERENT SERVICE CENTERS AND THEY DIDNT FIND A PROBLEM. I DROVE IT AGAIN, AND IT HAPPENED 3 TIMES ON THE FREEWAY FROM SAN DIEGO TO ORANGE COUNTY. I HAD MY CAR TOWED, DID MY OWN RESEARCH AND LEARNED THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH FORD EDGES FOR MY SPECIFIC YEAR. THE MANUFACTURER IS NOT COVERING IT. I AM SELLING THIS CAR BECAUSE I AM FEARFUL FOR MY LIFE AND MY BABY GIRL THAT WAS IN THE CAR WITH ME.",
