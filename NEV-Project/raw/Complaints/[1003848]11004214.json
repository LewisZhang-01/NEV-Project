MY CAR HAS STALLED NUMEROUS TIMES INCLUDING ON THE HIGHWAY. I HAVE ALREADY HAD IT TOWED TO ANOTHER SHOP, AND NOW I NEED IT TO GO TO THE DEALERSHIP. THE GUY ON THE PHONE AT THE DEALERSHIP KNOWS THE RECALL AND ISSUES, BUT BASICALLY SAYS MY CAR DOESN'T QUALIFY. IT ONLY GETS THE EXTENSION OF WARRANTY ON THE MOTOR. HOW CAN A COMPANY MAKE A VEHICLE THAT COULD KILL SOMEONE DUE TO POOR ASSEMBLY AND NOT REALLY BE WILLING TO HELP? THEY SHOULD ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY AND FIX MY CAR.",
