I HAVE REPLACED THE SOCKET AND LIGHT-BULBS MULTIPLE TIMES. I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE I FEEL TURN SIGNALS ARE VITALLY IMPORTANT, AND ACCIDENTS COULD AND DO OCCUR WITHOUT THEM. ALSO, SINCE THE SOCKETS ARE SHORTING OUT, I AM WORRIED THAT A BIGGER ELECTRICAL PROBLEM COULD MANIFEST BECAUSE OF THAT. I KNOW THAT MANY OTHER OWNERS OF THESE CARS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS, BUT I AM CONFUSED WHY A RECALL FOR SUCH A BAD AND DANGEROUS DESIGN HAS NOT BEEN PUT INTO PLACE.",
