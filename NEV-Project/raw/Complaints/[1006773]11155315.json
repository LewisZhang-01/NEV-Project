        "summary": "HID HEADLIGHTS. MY PROBLEM HAS BEEN WITH MY HEADLIGHTS EVER SINCE I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE USED IN JULY OF 2015. EVERY NOW AND THEN THE PASSENGER SIDE HEADLIGHT WOULD FLICKER AND GO OUT. I CAN GET THE HEADLLIGHT TO COME BACK ON BY TURNING OFF THE HEADLIGHTS AND TURNING THEM BACK ON. THE PROBLEM CAN BE SO BAD AT TIMES THAT I HAVE TO DO IT REPEATEDLY WHILE I'M DRIVING. I DO MOST OF MY DRIVING AT NIGHT SO THIS HAS BECOME A VERY REAL ISSUE FOR ME. I'VE READ HOW OTHERS HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM BUT ACURA REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT. IT'S A COSTLY REPAIR ESPECIALLY IF THEY CAN'T FIND EXACTLY WHAT THE ISSUE IS. I'VE ALREADY GOTTEN STOPPED BY A POLICEMAN ABOUT THE HEADLIGHT BEING OUT. AND WHEN I EXPLAINED TO HIM WHAT THE ISSUE WAS HE LET ME GO ONCE I SHOWED HIM THAT IT CAME BACK ON. THE CAR ITSELF HAS BEEN AMAZING TO DRIVE ESPECIALLY HOW HARD I'VE DRIVEN IT OVER THE YEARS AND IT NOW HAS ABOUT 238,000 MILES ON IT OF WHICH I PUT ABOUT 95,000 MILES. OTHER MAJOR REPAIRS LIKE THE AIR CONDITIONING I HAD REPLACED WITHIN A MONTH AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR UNDER WARRANTY. I WAS NOT SO LUCKY WITH THE RADIATOR THAT WENT UP. THE WHOLE ORDEAL ENDED UP COSTING OVER $1000 AT A AAA AUTO REPAIR CENTER. I STILL SAY IT IS AN AMAZING CAR FOR THE TECHNOLOGY, ROAD MILES, AND AGE OF VEHICLE. I PURCHASED IT BECAUSE IT WAS ALL-WHEEL DRIVE AND THE PRICE WAS JUST UNDER $10K BACK IN 2015. THIS CAR NEW WAS MORE LIKE $50K-$55K. I WISH THAT ACURA WOULD ISSUE A RECALL AND MAKE THE NECESSARY REPAIRS FOR THE HID SYSTEM. I ACTUALLY READ HOW ONE OWNER HAD BOTH HEADLIGHTS GO OUT WHILE DRIVING. SCARY TO EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT HAPPENING AT THE WRONG TIME AND THEY NOT KNOWING HOW TO FIX IT THE WAY I LEARNED WHICH IS TO TURN THEM OFF AND ON. SOMETIMES I CAN GO SEVERAL MONTHS WITH NO ISSUES AND THEN OTHERS IT HAPPENS JUST ABOUT EVERY NIGHT DEPENDING ON CLIMATE I SOMETIMES THINK, SPECIFICALLY, HUMIDITY, BUT I CAN'T BE SURE.",
