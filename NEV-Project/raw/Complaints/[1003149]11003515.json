THE CAR IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED AND IT HAS NEVER GIVEN US ANY TROUBLE. DURING OUR DRIVE WE NOTICED SOMETHING WAS WRONG. THE THE CAR STARTED TO FEEL HOT, BUT WE WEREN'T TOO SURE IF IT'S JUST HOT OUT OR IF THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG, BECAUSE THE AC WAS ON. WE PULLED OVER AND TURNED THE CAR OFF. WE CHECKED THE COOLANT AND SAW THAT WE HAD OIL. WE OPENED THE TRUNK, FELT AROUND TO SEE IF IT WAS HOT AND TO SEE IF WE SMELL ANYTHING. IT SEEMED FINE. AS SOON AS WE DROVE OFF, NOT 2 MINUTES IN, WHEN DRIVER SAID THE GAS PETAL FELT WEIRD, IT DROPPED FROM 50 TO 30 TO 20MPH AND WE HEARD A LIGHT DRILLING NOISE. AS SOON AS WE STEPPED OUT OF THE CAR, IT WAS IN FLAMES. OUR FAMILY COULD HAVE DIED.    HTTPS://WWW.FACEBOOK.COM/VALHALLAFD/POSTS/1548408978544577",
