THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE BECAUSE I NEED MY TRUCK AND I DO NOT APPRECIATE IT BEING IN THE SALT WATER ELEMENTS, WITHOUT COVERING FOR UP TO 2 MONTHS OR MORE.  I WILL FEEL MUCH BETTER IF YOU/COMPANY PROVIDED A TRUCK COVER TO GO OVER MY TRUCK BECAUSE I PAID EXTRA MONEY, THROUGH TOYOTA, TO HAVE A SPECIAL COATING ON THE TRUCK TO PROTECT IT FROM THE ELEMENTS.  I WASH THE TRUCK EVERY 1 1/2 TO 2 WEEKS SO THAT ELEMENTS DO NOT RUIN THE COATING ON MY TRUCK.  SO UP TO 2 MONTHS OR MORE TO FIX A SLIGHT LEAK IS RIDICULOUS BEYOND BELIEF.",
