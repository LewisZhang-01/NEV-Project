LUCKILY THERE WAS ENOUGH DISTANCE BETWEEN ME AND THE CAR BEHIND ME WAS THAT IT DIDN'T RESULT IN AN ACCIDENT. I HELD THE GEARSHIFT IN DRIVE WITH MY RIGHT HAND AND STEERED WITH MY LEFT UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO TURN OFF OF THE STREET INTO A PARKING LOT. I COULD NOT PUT THE CAR IN PARK. I PRESSED THE PARK BUTTON AND NOTHING HAPPENED. I TURNED THE CAR OFF, WAITED A MINUTE AND STARTED IT AGAIN. I COULD SHIFT INTO REVERSE, BUT IT CONTINUED TO POP BACK INTO NEUTRAL WHEN IN DRIVE. I HAD TO DRIVE HOME HOLDING THE GEARSHIFT IN DRIVE WITH ONE HAND.",
