I WAS INFORMED THAT I HAVE A LEAK IN MY CAR. THE SUNROOF HAS DRAIN TO TRANSPORT WATER TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE CAR. THERE IS A FIREWALL WITH CLIPS THAT ALLOW FOR THIS TO FUNCTION PROPERLY. THE FIREWALLS IN MY SUNROOF DRAIN HAVE FAILED CAUSING WATER TO SIT BENEATH THE CARPET OF MY CAR. THE CARPET IS SOAKED AS THE WATER HAS NO WHERE TO GO AND THE SMELL IS ALMOST UNBEARABLE. IN DOING RESEARCH AND CONSULTING WITH THE DEALERSHIP, I HAVE FOUND THAT THIS ISSUE IS NOT PREVENTABLE. THE MATERIAL SURROUNDING THE CLIPS IN MY FIREWALL HAVE WORN OUT. THE DEALERSHIP CAN REPLACE THE CLIPS AND PLACE ANOTHER SUBSTANCE ON IT TO PREVENT THE ISSUE FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. THE COST TO REPLACE THE SLIPS, CLEAN THE CARPET, AND DISINFECT WITH LABOR IS $1,200.00.   THE LONGER THAT THE WATER SITS THERE, THE LONGER THE ODOR REMAINS AND THE HIGHER THE RISK OF CAUSING OTHER ISSUES AND HAVING MOLD IN THE VEHICLE.   I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THE ODOR FOR ALMOST A MONTH NOW BUT I MOST RECENTLY WAS INFORMED OF THE SPECIFICS.",
