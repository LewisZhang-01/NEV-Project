THIS IS AN EXPENSIVE PART TO REPLACE AND THEY ARE NOT HELPING ANYONE?  I AM AFRAID I WILL GET STUCK SOMEWHERE AND MY CAR WILL NOT START - BUT IT IS ALMOST ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET IT REPAIRED!!!!  I HAVE TO CRANK IT MANY TIMES BEFORE IT WILL START.  THE ONE SHOP MADE ME GET A NEW BATTERY - BUT THAT DID NOT MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.  I FEEL LIKE I WILL GET STRANDED SOMEWHERE UNSAFE!",
