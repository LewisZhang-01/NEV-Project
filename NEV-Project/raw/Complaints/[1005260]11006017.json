TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR A TIRE RATED AT 60K MILES.  FOR NEW CAR PURCHASES, CONTINENTAL HAS NO TREAD WEAR REPLACEMENT POLICY.  THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND UNACCEPTABLE.  IF PURCHASED FOR AFTER-MARKET USE, IT WOULD BE COVERED FOR A PRO-RATA REPLACEMENT.  WHY ARE THESE TIRES WEARING OUT SO QUICKLY?  CAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM ON MY END WAS DRIVING THE CAR AND HAVING CONTINENTAL CONTIPROCONTACT TIRES ON THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE.",
