        "summary": "THERE WAS A REGIONAL RECALL DONE ON THE FUEL PUMP MODULE ON MANY DIFFERENT GM VEHICLES. DUE TO A CRACK IN THE PLASTIC AROUND THE MODULAR CAUSED BY EXTREME HEAT EXPOSURE. WHEN THE ISSUE OCCURS, IT LEAKS GAS AND FUMES, ALSO THERE IS A VERY PROMINENT GAS SMELL SURROUNDING THE ENTIRE VEHICLE HOURS AFTER BEING PARKED. I LIVE IN KENTUCKY, MY VIN IS BETWEEN THE VIN BREAKPOINTS ON THE RECALL BUT DUE TO MY REGION, I'M NOT INCLUDED IN THE RECALL. GM TO SAVE MONEY HAS MADE A SPECIAL POLICY CONCERNING THIS ISSUE TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND PAY FULLY BUT BECAUSE IT IS NOT A \"SAFETY CONCERN\" WHICH WAS SAID TO ME BY CHEVROLET CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVE PAUL, IT WASN'T A DIRE ISSUE. THIS IS A SAFETY CONCERN DIRECTLY STATED BY NHTSA, AND THE PART IN GENERAL SHOULD BE RECALLED COMPLETELY NOT JUST REGIONALLY. I AM NOW, DUE TO IT BEING MY ONLY TRANSPORTATION, UNTIL I CAN AFFORD A RENTAL, DRIVING A VEHICLE THAT IS LEAKING GAS AND FUMES DUE TO A FAULTY FACTORY PART PUT ON MY VEHICLE BY GM. THIS ISSUE SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. CONSUMERS ARE IN DANGER AND DUE TO NOT BEING IN A CERTAIN \"REGION\" WE ARE RISKY OUR SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF OTHERS BECAUSE WE CAN NOT GET A FAIR RECALL DONE.",
