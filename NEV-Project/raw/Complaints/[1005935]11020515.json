WE WERE SURE IF IT WAS A GLITCH SINCE THE CAR CAN SOMETIMES BE GLITCHY,LIKE THE RADIO FUNCTIONS NOT WORKING OR THE CAR CUTS OFF BUT IS SOMEHOW STILL RUNNING.  ANYWAY, ON 18 AUG, I NOTICED THAT THE POWER STEERING WOULD GO OUT IF YOU DON'T PRESS THE BREAK PADDLE. AGAIN, IT DIDN'T START OUT THAT WAY, BUT  PROCEEDED THE MOVE I DROVE. BY 26 AUG, IT WAS GOING OUT JUST ABOUT FROM THE TIME I STARTED THE CAR UNTIL I STOPPED FOR THE DAY. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP ON28 AUG AND HAD THE PUMP REPLACED. I GOT MY CAR BACK ON 29 AUG. SO FAR, NO ISSUES.  THE INCIDENTS TOOK PLACE MAINLY WHILE SLOWING DOWN TO MAKE A TURN, PARKING. I NOTICED THAT IT A LITTLE WHEN I WAS DRIVING THAT THE WHEEL WOULD STIFFEN BUT IT WAS NOT TOO BAD SINCE I COULD JUST PRESS THE GAS PADDLE AND IT WOULD LOOSEN.",
