System message  6. Locks locking and unlocking while the car was in motion 7. Failure to disengage the electronic parking brake 8. Car wouldn\u2019t start at all  While on the freeway locks started acting up locking and unlocking by themselves, got off the freeway and turn the car off to see if that would fix the issue. It didn\u2019t fix the problem! Tried turning on the car and had a hard time starting the car than the parking brake didn\u2019t disengage and all the warning lights listed above came on and the car had no power. Very dangerous I do not want to be statistic killed by my own car. If I take it to the dealer they will charge me a lot of money to diagnose and find nothing like always. I have no money to throw away like that.   I have a family and I don\u2019t want to die due to my car malfunctioning on the freeway or street loosing power like it did.very concerned at this point!",
