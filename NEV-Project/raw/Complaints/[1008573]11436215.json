        "summary": "My 2013 Chevrolet Silverado frame broke when I was driving it down my road with my small kids in tow.  When I got home and inspected I noticed my spare tire was not secure and corrosion in the rear of my frame.  I had the frame inspected by my dealership and it was confirmed the frame was defective, severely corroded in the mid and rear section.  The front was in almost new condition.  The stickers still intact.  They suggested I contact GM.  There were no warning lamps.  GM has committed to repairing the vehicle due to the wax coating defect. Now they are not cooperating due to no availability of frame.  I have not had a vehicle for almost 5 months.  Had I been driving at a high rate of speed when the frame broke or someone hit me there could have been an entirely different outcome as the frame has no integrity.  The truck would have crumpled.  There are many trucks left on the road with this HAZARDOUS issue.  Please see attached photos of well cared for truck and defective frame.",
