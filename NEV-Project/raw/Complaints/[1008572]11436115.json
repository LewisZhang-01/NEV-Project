        "summary": "2016 GMC Terrain SLT, service engine light came on, vehicle stalled many times, restarted but drove and misfired, stalled again, was able to get it to repair garage who I trust. He checked code and said I had to put a complete timing chain kit. Total cost came to $992.36 and didn't have a vehicle for a week due to weekend and a holiday. The vehicle only had 30,763 miles on it at the time but was out of factory warrantee. Reading other customer complaints, this looks like an ongoing problem and I feel should warrant a recall. Additional info such as repair invoice is attached. Please reply when received and thank you for your time.",
