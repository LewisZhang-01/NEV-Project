        "summary": "REAR WINDSHIELD, DRIVER SIDE WINDOW, FRONT WINDSHIELD, REAR RIGHT PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW HAVE LARGE AREAS (OVER 1 SQUARE FOOT) OF GLASS DISTORTION MADE IN THE FABRICATION OF THE GLASS.     STATIC NON MOVING CAR SITUATION: WHEN THE CAR IS NOT MOVING IT LOOKS LIKE THE SHIMMERING EFFECT OF HOT AIR RISING UP FROM A VERY HOT ASPHALT ROAD.  ALL IMAGES THROUGH THE AREAS OF DISTORTION BECOME NOTICEABLY DISTORTED LIKE A CIRCUS MIRROR OR AN ALTERNATING CONVEX CONCAVE MIRROR. AS THE DRIVER THESE AREAS IMPAIR MY VIEW AS I LOOK AHEAD AND SCAN THE VIEW FROM 60 DEGREES TO MY LEFT OR RIGHT (IN MY SPECIFIC SITUATION). THIS AFFECTS THE IMAGE I SEE OF PEDESTRIANS OR BICYCLISTS WAITING TO CROSS THE CROSSWALK OR ROAD IN FRONT OF ME.     DYNAMIC MOVING CAR SITUATION: AS YOU DRIVE FORWARD ALL IMAGES NEAR AND FAR PASS FRONT TO BACK THROUGH THE DISTORTION-CAUSING AREAS OF THE GLASS WINDOW AND RESULT IN IMAGE OSCILLATIONS. AS YOU DRIVE FASTER THE UNDULATIONS APPEAR TO UNDULATE  AND OSCILLATE FASTER.  ROAD LANE LINES APPEAR TO OSCILLATE INSTEAD OF REMAIN STRAIGHT. ALL IMAGES SEEN THROUGH THIS DISTORTION OSCILLATE THE FASTER YOU DRIVE. IN YOUR PERIPHERAL VISION IT IS NOTICEABLE AND VERY DISTRACTING AS YOU ARE CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT YOUR REAR VIEW MIRRORS THROUGH THE DISTORTION AREA AND TO THE RANGE OF VIEW 60 DEGREES OR MORE TO THE SIDES AND IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR. YOU CANNOT IGNORE THESE QUICKLY OSCILLATING/VIBRATING LIKE IMAGES IN YOUR PERIPHERAL VIEW.  IT HAS THE EFFECT OF LOOKING OUT OF A SHIP'S PORTHOLE AND SEEING ROUGH SWELLY SEAS THAT CAUSE SEASICKNESS AND NAUSEA.  IT IS LIKE YOUR CORRECTIVE EYE GLASS LENS HAS A BLURRY SPOT.     AS SOON AS I BOUGHT THIS NEW CAR AND DROVE IT HOME I NOTICED IT 6-15-2017.",
