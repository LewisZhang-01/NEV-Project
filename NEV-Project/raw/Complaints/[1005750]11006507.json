        "summary": "I WAS DRIVING ON A FOUR LANE HIGHWAY WITH MY 4 YR OLD AND 7 YR OLD.  LITERALLY AS I PULLED OFF ONTO THE OFF RAMP, MY DASH LIT UP STATING \"HYBRID SYSTEM NOT CHARGED. PULL OFF AND TURN OFF ENGINE\" I DID NOT EVEN HAVE TIME TO DO THIS WHEN THE ENGINE SHUT OFF IN AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS PLACE. IF THIS HAD HAPPENED WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY, WE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.  AFTER HOURS SPENT HAVING TO CONVINCE THE DEALERSHIP TO TOW THE VEHICLE AND PROVIDE A RIDE FOR ME AND MY CHILDREN, WE FINALLY WERE ABLE TO GET A RENTAL.  KIA SAID THE HYBRID BATTERY DIED BUT IT IS ON BACK ORDER AND NOT AVAILABLE IN THE UNITED STATES UNTIL OCTOBER (3 MONTHS FROM NOW). HMMMM SOMETHING SOUNDS FISHY TO ME.  I WILL NEVER DRIVE A KIA AGAIN.  THE WHOLE ORDEAL WAS TRAUMATIZING TO MY CHILDREN AND WE WERE MADE TO FEEL LIKE WE WERE THE ONES AT FAULT.",
