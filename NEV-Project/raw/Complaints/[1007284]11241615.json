A SEARCH ONLINE HAS TURNED UP A PLETHORA OF OTHERS WITH THE SAME ISSUE IN 2012-2015 VELOSTERS. THERE'S SIMPLY TOO MUCH AMPERAGE RUNNING THROUGH THE CONNECTION FOR THE HIGH SPEED FAN SETTING WITH IMPROPER MATERIALS USED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PARTS TO HANDLE IT. SIMPLY PUT; THIS IS A STRAIGHT UP FIRE HAZARD. THE FACT THAT THERE E BEEN SO MANY COMPLAINTS, YET NO ACTION ON HYUNDAI'S PART IS NEGLIGENT.",
