ACURA REFUSES TO PAY CLAIMS AGAINST ITS OWN POLICY ON THE TSB RELEASED.  MY VEHICLE HAS AN ISSUE WITH THE ACTIVE DAMPERS AND ALL 4 STRUTS NEED REPLACING AT A COST OF ABOUT $4000.  ACURA WILL NOT HELP ME STATING THE EXTENDED WARRANTY EXPIRED MAY 8, 2017.  HOWEVER THEY INCLUDE VERBIAGE OF 7 YEARS AFTER PURCHASE REGARDLESS OF DATE, MY CAR WAS ORIGINALLY PURCHASED FEB 2011 WELL WITHIN THE 7 YEAR TIME FRAME.    AT ANY SPEED GOING OVER BUMPS THE CAR MAKE CLUNKY SOUNDS FRONT AND REAR AND FEELS BOATY, LESS STABLE.    THE CONDITION WAS HAPPENING SINCE WINTER, 3 OF 4 STRUTS ARE BLOWN.  CAUSING A NEED FOR ALL 4 STRUTS TO BE REPLACED.  DIAGNOSED 7/7/2017 BECAUSE I WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THE EXTENDED WARRANTY AND FIGURED I'D WAIT UNTIL MY NEXT OIL CHANGE TO DRIVE THE 20 MILES TO MY ACURA DEALER.  THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE AND ACURA REFUSES CLAIMS FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR MOST PEOPLE WITHOUT CAUSE OR JUSTIFICATION.  ACURA TREATS THE EXTENDED WARRANTY OF AN ACURA OEM PART KNOWINGLY FAULTY AS A FAVOR TO CUSTOMERS AND NOT A RIGHT TO SAFETY.",
