        "summary": "THE FUEL TANK LEAKS FROM THE GAS CAP. ALSO, THIS IS NOT MY FIRST KTM, WHICH HAS HAD A LEAKING GAS CAP. IT'S MY 3RD ONE. THIS ISSUE IS VERY WELL-DOCUMENTED ON THE FORUMS AS WELL AS ON YOUTUBE. GASOLINE POURS RIGHT OUT OF THE GAS CAP ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS FULL OR WHEN ACCELERATING OR DECELERATING BRISKLY.     I AM FAIRLY CERTAIN THIS IS AN ISSUE TO DO WITH THE HIGH ETHANOL CONTENT PRESENT IN ALL U.S. GAS. THE STANDARD FUEL IS E10, WHICH MEANS 90% GASOLINE AND 10% ETHANOL. THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST DUCATI IN THE PAST FOR THIS ISSUE ALTHOUGH IT HAS CROPPED WITH OTHER MANUFACTURERS. THE ISSUE ARISES FROM A REACTION WITH ETHANOL IN PLASTIC TANKS. IT IS NOT AN ISSUE WITH METAL TANKS. MOST MANUFACTURERS HAVE FIXED THE ISSUE OR STOPPED USING THE PLASTIC. HOWEVER, KTM REMAINS A MAJOR PROBLEM AS SEEN ABOVE. EVEN THE NEWEST 2016 AND 2017 MODELS HAVE THE SAME ISSUES, WHICH ARE AGAIN DOCUMENTED IN THE FORUMS. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE AND DANGEROUS. *TT  *JS",
