        "summary": "Water pump was replaced a few months ago after VW dealer discovering cracked pump housing during routine maintenance. A few days ago a \"CHECK COOLANT LEVEL\" message was displayed. Immediate check underneath vehicle found no evidence of external coolant leak. However, reservoir coolant tank found to be almost empty. Visual inspection of engine compartment showed all coolant hoses to be intact, cap secure on ball style reservoir tank without evidence of leakage. No odor of coolant in or around vehicle. Research on this problem found hundreds of 2018-2019 VW Atlas owners with identical symptom description, most ended up finding evidence of coolant in engine oil (crankcase).  A sample of crankcase engine oil has been sent to an independent laboratory for analysis. The General Manager and Service Manager at VW dealer have been notified of the issue and that it is a known serious problem to VW Atlas owners despite not having risen to the level of  a recall. Once VW has completed diagnosis and repair, the plan is to resubmit another sample for post-repair analysis. This vehicle was purchased new from VW and we are the first and only owners. With the exception of tire service and replacement of the battery, ALL other maintenance has been performed at VW. All recommended routine services have been completed on time, by VW per manufacturer recommendations. Let me be very clear on this point: WE DO NOT PLACE ANY BLAME ON THE VW DEALER(S) THAT HAVE SERVICED THIS VEHICLE SINCE WE TOOK DELIVERY. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A MANUFACTURER ISSUE THAT HAS YET TO BE ADDRESSED AND JUST WANTED TO DO OUR PART IN REPORTING FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF ALL ATLAS OWNERS.",
