WHEN THIS HAPPENS EVENTUALLY THE CLUTCH WILL NOT DISENGAGE.  MAKING IT NECESSARY TO TURN THE BIKE OFF IN ORDER TO DISENGSGE THE CLUTCH.  AT ONE POINT I WAS UNABLE TO PULL THE CLUTCH LEVER IN WHEN APPROCHING A STOP LIGHT ON A BUSY MAJOR INTERSECTION.  I HAD TO TURN THE MOTORCYCLE OFF AND DRIFT TO THE SHOULDER AT THE LAST MOMENT.  I HAVE SINCE HAD AN ACCIDENT ON A GRAVEL DRIVEWAY WHILE TRYING TO SHIFT GEARS.  THE CLUTCH IS UNRELIABLE, AT TIMES IT WORKS CORRECTLY AND AT OTHER TIMES IS BECOMES TOO STIFF TO OPERATE.  I HAVE DRIVEN MOTORCYCLES FOR 27 YEARS AND AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH CLUTCH OPERATION.  I HAVE RECENTLY PURCHASED THIS MOTORCYCLE AND IT HAS ONLY 300 MILES ON IT. I AM UNABLE TO DRIVE THIS MOTORCYCLE UNTIL THIS ISSUE IS RESOLVED.",
