I JUST PURCHASED THIS CAR 30 DAYS AGO AND NOW HAVE A CRACK IN THE DASH. BY READINGUP ON THIS, THERE IS SO MANY COMPLAINTS. I HAVE HAD IN THE PAST A 2004 TAHOE WITH NO,COMPLAINTS.I FEEL THAT GM SHOULD GET OFF THERE POCKET BOOKS AND RECALL THIS. THIS TAHOE ONLY HAS 48,000 MILES. PRACTICALLY BRAND NEW. COME ON GM DO THE RIGHT THING. IF AN ACCIDENT OCCURS AND I LOOSE AN EYE OR SUFFER FACIAL DAMAGE DUE TO FLYING DEBRIS FROM A CRACKED DASH THAT WILL BE ON YOU. I ALSO HAVE A CAMRY. THEY RECALLED THERE DASH JUST BECAUSE ITS STICKY. STEP UP MADE IN THE USA. PLEASE. AFTER PAYING $29000. FOR A CAR THIS SHOULD BE FIXED. THIS CAR WAS SITTING STILL WHEN THIS HAPPENED.",
