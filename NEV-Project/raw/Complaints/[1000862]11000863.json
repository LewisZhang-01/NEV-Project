I THOUGHT TO SWITCH TO HIGH BEAMS AND LUCKILY THEY WORKED ON HIGH BEAM THANK GOODNESS THIS WAS A ROAD I KNEW WELL.. I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW OFTEN THIS HAPPENS DURING THE DAYTIME. BUT IT OCCURRED SEVERAL TIMES AFTER THIS.  I HAD MY VEHICLE CHECKED AND WAS TOLD IT WAS A RELAY. CHANGED IT AND PROBLEM SOLVED, UNTIL NOW. THE ISSUE IS BACK, GM SENT ME A \"SPECIAL COVERAGE\" LETTER, I CALLED THE NUMBER ON THE LETTER AND WAS DIRECTED TO TAKE IT TO A CHEV. DEALERSHIP  TO CONFIRM MY VEHICLE DOES HAVE THE HEADLAMP DRIVER MODULE ISSUE THEN CHEVROLET WILL LET ME KNOW WHAT WOULD BE NEXT. THEY DID CONFIRM MY VEHICLE HAS THE ISSUE  BUT CHEVROLET WILL NOT COVER MY VEHICLE BECAUSE IT IS OVER THE MILEAGE OF 150,000.  REALLY? IS MY VEHICLE NO LONGER WORTH FIXING OR IS THE ISSUE SUPPOSED TO RESOLVE ITSELF AFTER THE 150,000 MILE MARK? A SALESMAN CALLED ME AFTER I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP TO ASK ABOUT ME TRADING OR GETTING RID OF MY VEHICLE, IS THIS A PLOY JUST TO SELL VEHICLES?",
