        "summary": "WE HAVE A 2017 GMC CANYON DIESEL WITH 56570 MILES ON IT. WHILE WE WERE DRIVING DOWN THE STREET (IT WAS RAINING) GOING ABOUT 30 MILES AN HOUR AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN THE \"SERVICE STABILITRAK\" CENSOR CAME ON AM IT INSTANTLY PUT THE BRAKE ON. WE TURNED THE TRUCK ON AND OFF. OVER AND OVER LETTING IT SIT FOR MORE THAT A MINUTE COMPLETELY AND STILL NOTHING....WE WERE DOWN THE STREET FROM OUR HOUSE AND MY HUSBAND HAD TO PUSH IT HOME. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN SUCH A DANGEROUS SITUATION &#128563; THERE HAPPENED TO BE NO ONE BEHIND US BUT IT WAS SO ABRUPT THAT IF WE DID THEY MOST DEFINITELY WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TIME TO STOP AND CRASHED RIGHT INTO US. I WILL BE CALLING GMC IN THE MORNING BUT WE WERE DEFINITELY GRATEFUL WE MADE IT HOME SAFELY THOUGH PUSHING A TRUCK THROUGH THE RAIN UP HILL WAS NOT FUN FOR MY HUSBAND.   WE HAVE READ UP ON THIS AND WAS COMPLETELY SURPRISED HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM. YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING PUT OUT FOR THIS LETTING PEOPLE KNOW....THIS IS CRAZY GM HAS EITHER BASICALLY IGNORED THIS OR SIMPLY DOES NOT CARE FOR SAFETY. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY TRUCK BUT THIS TRULY DISAPPOINTS ME I HOPE WE ARE NOT PUT IN THE SAME SITUATION AS ALL THESE OTHER FOLKS WHO WERE PUT THROUGH THE RINGER WITH NO RESULT FOR THIS ISSUE!",
