HOWEVER, AFTER TOPPING IT OFF, IT CONTINUES AND SOMETIMES GET EVEN LOUDER.  I HAVE ALSO NOTICED CRACKING SOUND FROM WHEEL WHEN DRIVING.  IT'S REALLY NOTICEABLE WHEN ROADS/STREETS ARE UNEVEN.  IT SOUNDS LIKE WHEELS ARE GOING TO ROLL OFF AT ANY TIME.  DEALERSHIP TOLD ME MY DRIVER SIDE MAP LIGHT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED.  HOWEVER, DRIVER SIDE MAP LIGHT WORKS ON RARE OCCASIONS.  I ALSO NOTICED THAT LIGHT ON DRIVER SIDE VISOR SEEMS TO HAVE A SHORT.  THIS IS VERY DISTURBING.  I OWNED A 98 HONDA ACCORD AND NEVER HAD THESE ISSUES FOR 13 YEARS.  I NOTICED THERE HAS BEEN RECALL FOR CERTAIN 2011 HONDA ACCORD FOR SUSPENSION ISSUES.  WHY IS THIS CAR NOT INCLUDED?",
