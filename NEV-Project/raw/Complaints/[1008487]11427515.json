        "summary": "My vehicle recently has had 2 issues that I have taken in to the Service Shop for 3 times and the problem has not been fixed. My most concerning issue is my brakes. My brakes are doing the exact problem indicated in this article: https://www.consumerreports.org/car-recalls-defects/gm-recalls-suvs-and-pickups-for-braking-issue/  When the brakes malfunction, I feel a vibrating brake pedal, feels like my vehicle is not going to stop on time, I hear a ticking noise from the engine and my Brake Assist Service light comes on. The issue continues until I can pull over and restart the vehicle. It is a very uneasy feeling having to drive a vehicle that you do not feel safe in. I called 800 Chevrolet's Customer Service number provided in the article and they are unaware of the recall mentioned in this article. I do not know where to go from here. I just want my vehicle fixed and to feel safe. My 2nd issue is regarding my Adaptive Cruise Control. I've had it in the shop 3 times for this also and they did replace a part but that did not fix this issue. I will be driving down the highway or interstate and out of the blue my alarm starts dinging, the seat vibrates, the cruise control gets kicked off and I get an alert on my dash stating that the Adaptive Cruise Control was disabled. Each time it has happened to me there is nothing around but it immediately starts reducing my speed. If someone were behind me it could cause a crash because of the unexpected speed limit reduction.  When you go in to look at recalls on 2018 Chevrolet Tahoes it shoes that there is 3 of them that have been issued, yet my VIN is not included in any of them?  What can I do from here? I've called Chevrolet's 800 # and they created a \"High Urgency Case\" but I have not heard back. Attached are my copies of service records and vehicle summary showing there has never been recalls on my VIN #.",
