        "summary": "2014 CHEVY SILVERADO LT WITH 27,000 MILES. NOTICED COOLANT SMELL NEAR FRONT OF TRUCK AFTER DRIVING IT. I LOOKED ON LINE AND FOUND SEVERAL SOURCES COMPLAINING ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE WITH COOLANT LEAK. I TOOK MY TRUCK INTO THE DEALERSHIP TO CHECK COOLANT LEAK. THEY FOUND OUT THE RADIATOR WAS CRACKED AND TOLD ME GM HAS AN ISSUE WITH THE THERMOSTAT OVERCYCLING CAUSING THE RADIATOR TO DEVELOP STRESS CRACKS AND LEAK COOLANT. MY TRUCK HOWEVER WAS PASS THE 36 MONTH BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY AND MY TRUCK DOESN'T FALL UNDER THEIR SPECIAL COVERAGE BULLETIN 15829 TO FIX THIS ISSUE FOR 5 YEARS OR 100,000 MILES. QUOTED AROUND $900 TO $1,000 TO REPLACE THERMOSTAT WITH A NEW VERSION THAT WILL NOT STRESS CRACK THE RADIATOR AND NEW RADIATOR (SAME PART AS ORIGINAL) IS PUT IN THE TRUCK. SO IF GM KNOWS THEY HAVE A PROBLEM BUT WILL ONLY FIX CERTAIN VEHICLES THAT HAVE THE SAME FAULTY THERMOSTAT. HOW IS THIS RIGHT?",
