IT IS ESPECIALLY NECESSARY WHEN DRIVING ON HIGHWAYS.  THE ONLY TIME I DON'T HAVE TO CONSTANTLY CORRECT THE STEERING IS WHEN THERE IS A CONSTANT SIDE WIND FROM ONE SIDE.  IT IS AS IF I'M DRIVING A HIGH MILEAGE VEHICLE WITH WORN STEERING COMPONENTS.  THE ISSUE HAS PERSISTED FROM DAY ONE WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS BOUGHT NEW.  THIS IS MY FOURTH SUBURBAN, AND THE FIRST TIME I HAVE THIS ISSUE.  I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT THE FIRST THREE SUBURBAN'S HAD HYDRAULIC P/S; AND THAT THIS SUBURBAN HAS ELECTRONIC P/S.  I HAVE COMPLAINED TO THE DEALERSHIP MULTIPLE TIMES, AND BEEN TOLD THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT.  I HAVE ALSO REPORTED IT TO GM UNDER CASE NUMBER 8-3065886402.",
