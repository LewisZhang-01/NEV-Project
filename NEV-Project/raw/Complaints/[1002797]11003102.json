THE INFANT CAR SEAT HANGS OFF THE SEAT AND IS NOT SAFELY SUPPORTED BY THE SEAT AN CHRYSLER HAS NO SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO FIX THE SAFETY ISSUE. ALSO SINCE IT'S A BENCH SEAT YOU CANNOT USE THE SEATBELT THAT CROSSES THE WALKWAY FOR ANY CAR SEAT BECAUSE THIS IS ALSO A SAFETY ISSUE THAT CHRYSLER DOES NOT HAVE A RESOLUTION FOR. THESE ISSUES ARE WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STATIONARY, AND IN MOTION ON ANY CITY STREET OR HIGHWAY, TURNING, OR TRAVELING STRAIGHT. CHRYSLER DOES NOT CARE IF PARENTS CAN SAFELY SECURE A CAR SEAT OF ANY KIND IN THEIR VEHICLES. INSTEAD THEY TELL YOU TO READ THE MANUAL FOR THE CAR SEAT AND FOR THE VEHICLE YOU PURCHASED AND THAT'S IT.",
