THE FIRST TIME HE WAS ONLY 7. IT IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR A DOOR HANDLE TO BE ABLE TO BE DESTROYED BY A CHILD MULTIPLE TIMES.     ALSO, THE HANDLE WHICH ALLOWS THE SECOND ROW SEAT TO FOLD FORWARD FOR PASSENGERS TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE THIRD ROW DOES NOT WORK. WE HAVE ASKED FOR THIS TO BE FIXED AT THE DEALERSHIP MULTIPLE TIMES BUT THEY HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO GET IT TO WORK PROPERLY EITHER. OBVIOUSLY BOTH OF THESE PROBLEMS OCCUR WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STATIONARY.",
