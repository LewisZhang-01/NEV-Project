THE POWER STEERING FLUID WAS LOW BUT NOT NEAR THE MINIMUM LEVEL, MORE FLUID WAS ADDED AND THE ISSUE SEEMED TO RESOLVE ITSELF. A FEW MONTHS LATER DURING A ROUTINE OIL CHANGE, THE MECHANIC NOTICED A POWER STEEEING FLUID LEAK AND SAID THE RACK AND PINION WAS LEAKING AND REPLACING IT WAS THE RECOMMENDED REPAIR. THE VEHICLE CURRENTLY HAS 62,000 MILES ON IT AND THE REPAIR INCLUDING ALIGNMENT IS AROUND  $1,250. MY ONLINE RESEARCH HAS REVEALED THIS ISSUE IS NOT ISOLATED.",
