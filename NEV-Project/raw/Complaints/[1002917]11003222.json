        "summary": "I WAS LEAVING WORK, AS I DROVE OFF ONTO THE STREET IN ODESSA, TEXAS THE VEHICLE SEEMED NORMAL FOR 10 MINS.  ALL OF SUDDEN THE FIRST BRAKE I TOOK THE BRAKE LIGHT CAME ON AT A STOP SIGN.  I PULLED OVER BECAUSE MY BRAKE PEDAL SLID ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FLOOR, AS A RESULT OF THIS MY VEHICLE WAS UNABLE TO STOP. I GOT OFF THE TRUCK AND CHECKED THE BREAK FLUID RESERVOIR AND IT WAS EMPTY.  I DROVE MY VEHICLE TO THE CLOSEST CONVENIENT STORE TO  PURCHASE BRAKE FLUID.  I BOUGHT TWO CONTAINERS AND POURED INTO THE RESERVOIR AND AS I DROVE OFF, THE VEHICLE SEEMED TO BE WORKING FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THE LIGHT CAME ON AGAIN.  I DROVE TO THE CLOSEST MECHANIC SHOP; I SPOKE THE MECHANIC AND EXPLAINED TO HIM WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS.  HE CHECKED FOR LEAKS AND DID NOT FIND ANY HE THEN MADE A THOROUGH CHECK INTO THE BRAKE BOOSTER.  HE FOUND THAT THE FLUID WAS ENTERING THE BRAKE BOOSTER. NOT A GOOD SIGN HE STATED. UPON ARRIVAL TO MY RESIDENCE, I LOOKED UP FORD MOTOR RECALLS AND I LEARNED THAT  THESE 2013-2014 FORD F150 VEHICLES HAD RECALLS TO REPLACE BRAKE MASTER CYLINDERS DUE TO BRAKE FLUID LEAKING FROM THE BRAKE MASTER CYLINDER INTO THE BRAKE BOOSTER. THE FORD MOTOR COMPANY RECALL WAS ISSUED BACK IN MAY 25, 2016.  HOWEVER, I HAVE YET TO  RECEIVE A NOTICE.",
