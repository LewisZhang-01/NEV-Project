        "summary": "Unable to start vehicle twice.  In both instances, foot was placed on the brake before pressing Start button and brake was extremely stiff.  When Start button is pushed, electronics engage (control panel lights, A/C, etc.) but engine will not engage.  In the first incident, car had been stopped to refuel and would not restart.  Car had been started without incident and been running for approximately 20 minutes prior to stopping for refueling.  Tried to restart the engine for 20-30 minutes unsuccessfully and had to have vehicle towed to authorized Toyota dealer.  Dealer was unable to look at it for two days and was able to start engine on the first try two days later.  Dealer could not replicate problem.  In the second incident, car had been in a parking lot for two hours on a hot day.  Again, brake was extremely stiff, electronics engaged but engine would not start.  A message appeared Brake Power Low.  We shut off A/C and were able to restart the vehicle.  In both instances, the driver-side door was open to try and let hot air out - we don't know if this has any bearing on the issue.",
