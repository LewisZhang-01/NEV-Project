AFTER PATIENTLY WAITING FOR A YEAR AND A HALF FOR A LETTER STATING NEW AIR BAG INFLATORS WERE AVAILABLE, I CALLED FORD LAST WEEK TO GET A RECALL STATUS.    THE FORD REPRESENTATIVE STATED THAT MY RECALL WAS VALID BUT FORD COULD NOT TELL ME WHEN A REPLACEMENT AIR BAG INFLATOR WOULD BE AVAILABLE.  THIS RESPONSE FROM FORD WAS OUTRAGEOUS SINCE THE TAKATA AIR BAG ISSUE HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR SOME YEARS NOW AND FORD HAS HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME TO FIND AND PROCURE  REPLACEMENTS.    PLEASE CONTACT FORD AND DEMAND THEY STOP DELAYING PROGRESS ON AIRBAG REPLACEMENTS.",
