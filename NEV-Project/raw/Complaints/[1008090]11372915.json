AFTER RESEARCHING THE COMBINATION OF LIGHTS AND SOUNDS FROM THE BRAKE PEDAL I DETERMINED THAT THE BRAKE ACTUATOR IS FAILING.  PER MY RESEARCH, CONTINUING TO OPERATE THE VEHICLE CAN RESULT IN A LOSS OF BRAKING ASSISTANCE.  OTHER TOYOTA PRIUS MODELS ARE COVERED UNDER EXTENDED WARRANTIES (REFERENCE ZJB), BUT THE PRIUS V MODELS, WHICH USE THE SAME ACTUATOR, ARE NOT.  AN ACCIDENT/INCIDENT HAS NOT YET OCCURED, BUT THIS SEEMS LIKE A HUGE CASE OF NEGLIGENCE ON TOYOTA.",
