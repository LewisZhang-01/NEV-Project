        "summary": "1.) FRONT BUMPER COVER DEVELOPED A BULGE (CAME A LOOSE) JUNE 2016 ON RIGHT FRONT SIDE BECAUSE THE BUMPER TABS ARE TOO THIN OR FLIMSY AND WILL NOT HOLD BUMPER COVER UNDERNEATH THE HEADLIGHT ASSEMBLY PROPERLY. THIS IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT BY THE LINCOLN MOTOR COMPANY AND THEY HAVE FAILED TO REPAIR MY CAR BUMPER  FOR ONE WHOLE YEAR. THE CAR DEALERSHIP THEY SENT ME TO CANNOT FIX THIS BUMPER BECAUSE IT IS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT, THEY ACTUALLY MAKE THE BULGE ON BUMPER WORSE. LINCOLN KNOWS THE BUMPER COVER IS DEFECTIVE AND HAS FAILED TO COME UP WITH A FIX THAT WILL LAST. THIS IS POOR WORKMANSHIP BY LINCOLN. CAR WAS STATIONARY IN MY DRIVEWAY. I WANT LINCOLN TO FIX MY CAR PROPERLY OR GIVE ME ANOTHER CAR OF EQUAL VALUE.  2.) BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT FRONT DOOR EXTERIOR BOTTOM BLACK PLASTIC DOOR PANELS WITH CHROME INSERTS HAVE COME LOOSE AND SHAKE WHEN OPENING OR CLOSING DOORS. THIS IS POOR WORKMANSHIP BY LINCOLN. CAR WAS STATIONARY AND IN MY DRIVEWAY.",
