IT STALLED ONCE ON A CITY STREET WHEN I PUT IS IN REVERSE. WHEN THIS HAPPENS, THE STEERING WHEEL LOSES POWER. I QUICKLY PUT IT IN NEUTRAL AND RESTART. THIS HAPPENS ALMOST DAILY. TO DATE, IT HAS STALLED 11-TIMES.    I FOUND THE AN ESTIMATED 300,000 CHRYSLER, DODGE AND JEEP VEHICLES MANUFACTURED IN 2007 AND 2008 WERE RECALLED FOR THE SAME STALLING PROBLEM THAT I AM EXPERIENCING. I AM VERY CONCERNED FOR MY SAFETY AND OTHERS BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS IS A PROGRESSIVE PROBLEM WHERE THE ENGINE MAY STALL WHILE IN MOTION.",
