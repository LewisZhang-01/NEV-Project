IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE FUEL TANK INLET CHECK VALVE (FUEL FILLER TUBE), BUT THE DANGEROUS SAFETY ISSUE REMAINS. I HAVE READ THAT 20,000 DURANGOS HAVE BEEN RECALLED FROM 2005 FOR THIS ISSUE, BUT FOR REASONS UNKNOWN, EVEN THOUGH MY 2005 DURANGO ALSO HAS THIS DANGEROUS SAFETY PROBLEM, I AM TOLD BY THE DEALER THAT MY 2005 DURANGO HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED. IF FOR SOME REASON IT HAS NOT BEEN RECALLED, IT OBVIOUSLY SHOULD BE RECALLED BECAUSE IT HAS THE SAME EXACT ISSUE THAT THE OTHER 2005 DURANGOS HAVE BEEN RECALLED FOR. SO WHY NOT MINE?",
