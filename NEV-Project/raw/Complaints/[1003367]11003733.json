TOOK TO PETERSON TOYOTA, BOISE, ID, ON 6/28/2017, AND WAS TOLD THAT I SHOULD TURN THE VEHICLE IN.  HOWEVER, THEY OFFERED TO PROVIDE ONLY A REPLACEMENT CAR, NOT A TRUCK, WHICH WOULD NOT BE OF ANY USE TO ME.  THEY ALSO REFUSED TO TELL ME HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO GET PARTS, POSSIBLY MONTHS.  I CALLED THE TOYOTA CORP CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER ON THAT DAY (1-888-270-9371), AND WAS TOLD A DEALER CUSTOMER SERVICE REP WOULD CONTACT ME NLT 6/30.  NO ONE CALLED, AND I CALLED TOYOTA AGAIN ON 7/1, AND WAS TOLD THAT BOTH A PETERSON AND A REGIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE REP WOULD CONTACT ME NLT 7/3.  NO ONE CALLED.  I AGAIN CALLED TOYOTA ON 7/6, AND WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A CALL FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE NLT 7/7. AGAIN, NO ONE CALLED.  PETERSON TOYOTA OF BOISE AND TOYOTA CORP ARE REFUSING TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS CONCERNING THIS SAFETY RECALL.  THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP AT THE 888 NUMBER HAS APOLOGIZED NUMEROUS TIMES AND SAYS SHE CAN NOT UNDERSTAND WHY I HAVE NOT BEEN CONTACTED BY A PETERSON AND A REGIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE MANAGER.  *TR",
