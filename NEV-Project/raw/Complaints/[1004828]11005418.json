        "summary": "AS PER NHTSA 16V-913 MY VOLKSWAGEN RABBIT HAS BEEN PRESENTING THE SYMPTOMS STATED IN THE SAFETY RECALL. THE ABS LIGHT, ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL, AND BRAKE LIGHT HAVE COME ON NUMEROUS TIMES AND HARD BRAKING, AND IN NOT SO HARD BRAKING IN THE SNOW. HE PROBLEM HAS PROGRESSIVELY WORSENED TO THE POINT THAT THESE LIGHTS NO LONGER GO OUT AFTER AND IGNITION CYCLE. I AM ESSENTIALLY DRIVING WITHOUT ABS OR STABILITY CONTROL, ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I PURCHASED THIS CAR. THE CODE FOR   U0121 LOST COMMUNICATION WITH ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM (ABS) CONTROL MODULE NO LONGER CLEAR WITH A HAND HELD CODE READER OR A LAPTOP RUNNING ROSS-TECH'S VCDS SOFTWARE. I TOOK MY BROKEN VOLKSWAGEN TO DANBURY VW IN DANBURY CT TO PERFORM THE SAFETY RECALL (16V-913). BECAUSE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE ABS CONTROL MODULE TO UPLOAD THE NEW SOFTWARE, THEY HAVE DENIED THE RECALL AND SAY I MUST FOOT THE BILL TO REPLACE THE MODULE SO THEY CAN THEN UPLOAD THE NEW SOFTWARE TO SEE IF THEY GET THE CODE FOR FAULTY SOLDER JOINT. VOLKSWAGEN IS TRYING TO SIDE STEP THIS ISSUE. I BELIEVE MY CAR WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO UPLOAD THE SOFTWARE WHEN THIS ISSUE FIRST STARTED HAPPENING, BUT NOW THE ABS CONTROL MODULE HAS COMPLETELY FAILED, PROBABLY DUE TO THE BAD SOLDER COMPOUND. NOW THEY ARE DENYING CLAIMS, I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE. THE NTHSA NEEDS TO LOOK DEEPER INTO THIS PROBLEM.",
