I TOOK IT TO THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP ON THORTON ROAD IN LITHIA SPRINGS, GA. IT'S TAKING 4-6 WEEKS JUST TO COMPLETE THE BEARINGS TEST. THE DEALERSHIP HAS NO AVAILABLE TEMPORARY VEHICLES, BECAUSE APPARENTLY SEVERAL OTHER OWNERS ARE IN FOR THE SAME ISSUE. THIS IS AN INCONVENIENCE, I'LL STILL BE MAKING PAYMENTS ON A VEHICLE THAT IS PARKED. WHEN I CALLED THE DEALERSHIP FOR A ROUGH ESTIMATE FOR TRADE IN, THEY TOLD ME 1K SINCE IT NEEDS A NEW MOTOR.",
