        "summary": "The transmission failed /malfunctioned. It\u2019s available for inspection upon request. My safety and the safety of others was put at risk when the vehicle stalled at a traffic light or in the middle of traffic. Took the vehicle to autozone to be scanned and they confirmed it was the transmission. The vehicle has not been inspected by the dealer yet because I would have to paid between $200-350 to have the vehicle towed to the dealership where the vehicle was purchased which is two hours away.  The local dealership charges $130 to diagnosis my vehicle. There were no warning lamps or messages prior to the failure.  The CVT message appeared on my dashboard after the vehicle stalled and would not accelerate more than 5 miles or would not move at all upon acceleration of the gas. In addition to the current transmission issue, I have also had the brake light switch adjusted twice.  The failure of the brake light switch drained the vehicle battery resulting in having the battery replaced as well.",
