UNDER HARD BRAKING, MY WIFE HIT THE DASHBOARD INSIDE THE CAR ONCE AS A PASSENGER. I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT IT IN EARLIER. I JUST BROUGHT IT IN TODAY (6/20/2017) TO THE MAZDA DEALER (PUTNAM MAZDA IN BURLINGAME, CA) AND THEY DISCOVERED THE SEATBELT'S TENSIONER IS BROKEN INTERNALLY. THEY ARE REPLACING IT, THOUGH THE PART IS BACKORDERED UNTIL JULY.    THERE IS REASONABLE SUSPICION TO BELIEVE MORE THAN MY VEHICLE MAY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED.",
