THIS CAR HAS ALWAYS BEEN GARAGE KEPT, RARELY DRIVEN EXCEPT ON NICE DAYS, I DON'T EVEN DRIVE IT ON RAINY DAYS & RARELY AT ALL IN THE WINTER. (NOW I WOULD BE AFRAID TO DRIVE IN THE RAIN BECAUSE IT MIGHT START LEAKING) I NOTICED IT HAD A HAIRLINE CRACK LAST YR ON 2 CORNERS BUT PREVIOUSLY WHEN WASHING IT I REALIZED ALL 4 SIDES ARE NOW COMPLETELY CRACKED APART.  I BOUGHT IT 6 YRS AGO & IT HAD 21,000 MILES ON IT & I HAVE ONLY PUT 19,000 MILES ON IT IN 6 YEARS.  IT IS IN IMMACULATE CONDITION EXCEPT NOW IT HAS 4 BIG CRACKS ON ALL 4 CORNERS OF MOON ROOF.",
