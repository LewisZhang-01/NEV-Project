THIS HAS HAPPENED 6 TIMES THIS YEAR. THE DEALER SHIP HAS WORKED ON THE TRUCK TWICE WITH NO SUCCESS. THE TRUCK HAS 20,000 MILES ON IT. THIS IS VERY SCARY AND DANGEROUS AS THE TRUCK FRONT END IS OUT OF CONTROL WHEN THIS HAPPENS. YESTERDAY WAS THE WORST. IT HAPPENED TWICE IN A 3 MILE STRETCH OF ROAD.",
