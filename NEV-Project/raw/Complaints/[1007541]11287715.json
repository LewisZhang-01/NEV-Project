        "summary": "I GOT INTO A ACCIDENT. AT THE INTERSECTION OF WASHINGTON ST AND 2ND ST IN RENO NV. I IMPACTED ANOTHER CAR AS THEY WENT ACROSS THE INTERSECTION. I HAD THE RIGHT OF WAY, I IMPACTED THE PASSENGER REAR END OF THE OTHER PERSONS VEHICLE.  THE MAIN POINT OF IMPACT ON MY YUKON WAS THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT CORNER. THE ACCIDENT WAS NOT VERY BAD, NO ONE REQUIRED MEDICAL ATTENTION AT THE SCENE. WHEN I  IMPACTED I  WAS TRAVELING LESS THAN 35 M P H.  AND ACCORDING TO THE DRIVEWISE DEVICE. THE VEHICLE IMPACTED AFTER APPLYING THE BREAK AT APPROX 16 MPH- AT WHICH POINT THE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED.  WHEN FURTHER LOOKING AT THE VEHICLE AND REPLACING THE AIRBAGS WE FOUND THAT THE SENSOR DID NOT NEED TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE THE WIRES BETWEEN THE AIRBAGS AND THE SENSORS WERE CRIMPED IN THE LITTLE BIT ON BODY DAMAGE THAT HAPPENED IN THE ACCIDENT, DEFLATING THE AIRBAGS UNNECESSARILY AND HINCE A SMALL ACCIDENT THAT HARDLY DAMAGED ANY OF THE VEHICLE RENDERED IT AS SALVAGE- BECAUSE THE AIRBAGS DEPLOYED DURING A LOW IMPACT ACCIDENT.",
