        "summary": "THE DOOR AJAR INDICATOR ON THE DASH IS LIT UP 100% OF THE TIME EVEN THOUGH IT APPEARS THAT ALL DOORS ARE CLOSED. THIS PROBLEM STARTED APPROX. 2 YEARS AGO. IN ADDITION IF THE CAR SITS FOR MORE THAN 1 DAY, IT DRAINS THE BATTERY AND THE CAR HAS TO BE JUMPED.  WHEN MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN OR START FROM A STOPPED POSITION, THE WARNING SOUND DINGS. AND THE KEY FOB CANNOT BE USED TO LOCK THE CAR. MY MECHANIC DISCOVERED THAT IT IS THE REAR HATCH SENSOR THAT IS FAULTY. MAYBE THE SENSOR IS FAULTY OR MAYBE I THINK THE HATCH IS CLOSED AND LATCHED AND IT REALLY ISN'T OR IT IS BUT AT ANY MOMENT, THE LATCH COULD RELEASE AND THE HATCH FLY OPEN.  AFTER DOING A GOOGLE SEARCH ON THIS PROBLEM, I DISCOVERED THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE ARE HAVING THE SAME ISSUE WITH THEIR HIGHLANDER....I HAVE ATTACHED A FILE THAT CONTAINS SCREEN SHOTS OF OTHERS WITH THIS ISSUE. I STOPPED CUTTING AND PASTING AFTER 17 PAGES. THIS AS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IT COMPROMISES THE QUALITY OF THE BATTERY AND THERE REALLY COULD BE A DOOR AJAR WHEN YOU THINK THE WARNING LIGHT ON THE DASH IS JUST FROM THE FAULTY HATCH SENSOR. (HEAVEN FORBID A CHILD SHOULD FALL OUT OF THE BACK SEAT WHEN DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD). I WOULD LIKE TO SEE TOYOTA TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PROBLEM AND ISSUE A RECALL.",
