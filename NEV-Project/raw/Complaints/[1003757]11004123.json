THE DEALER SAID THEY WOULD RECHARGE THE BATTERY, AS THAT WAS THE PROBLEM. I ASKED FOR THEM TO REPLACE THE BATTERY, SO IF THIS HAPPENED AGAIN, WE WOULD KNOW 100%, THAT IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE CAUSING THE CAR TO LOSE ALL POWER WHILE DRIVING.  LESS THEN 3 WEEKS LATER, 6 DAYS BEFORE OWNING THE CAR FOR A FULL MONTH, MY SON IS DRIVING THE CAR, AND WHILE IN THE MIDDLE OF A 4 WAY INTERSECTION, THE VEHICLE LOSES ALL POWER AND STOPS DEAD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD.  THE FIRST TIME, THE VEHICLE WAS PULLING FORWARD INTO A PARKING SPACE, THE SECOND, DRIVING FORWARD WITH A SLIGHT TURN.   AFTER ARGUING WITH THE DEALER THAT THIS WAS IN FACT A HUGE SAFETY PROBLEM, AND I NOR MY SON FELT SAFE IN THE VEHICLE, DID THEY AGREE TO BUY THE VEHICLE BACK, IF I WAS WILLING TO BUY ANOTHER VEHICLE FROM THEM.",
