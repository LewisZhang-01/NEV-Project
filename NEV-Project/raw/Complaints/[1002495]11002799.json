        "summary": "DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD AT APPROXIMATELY 45-50 MPH AND THE ENGINE BEGAN KNOCKING. LOST ALL POWER TO THE CAR. A FEW MOMENTS LATER, THE CAR STOPPED COMPLETELY IN THE MIDDLE OF A BUSY INTERSECTION. I GOT OUT OF THE CAR AND PUSHED IT INTO A GAS STATION PARKING LOT. THE CAR WOULD CRANK BUT THE KNOCKING OF THE ENGINE WAS BECOMING WORSE. I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO A SHOP WHERE THE PROBLEM WAS DIAGNOSED AS \"ROD KNOCK\" WHICH IS CAUSED BY A FAULTY MOTOR, ALLOWING METAL SHAVINGS TO ENTER AND BLOCK THE FLOW OF OIL TO THE MOTOR. NOT WANTING TO BELIEVE THAT I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO PAY $5,000 TO REPLACE THE ENGINE, I GOT A SECOND OPINION FROM A KIA DEALERSHIP IN MY HOME TOWN. NOT ONLY DID THEY CONFIRM WHAT THE INITIAL MECHANIC HAD DIAGNOSED, BUT WERE VERY RUDE WHEN ASKING US TO \"REMOVE OUR CAR FROM THEIR PARKING LOT BECAUSE UNLESS WE WERE GOING TO PAY THEM TO FIX IT, IT HAD NO BUSINESS BEING THERE.\" ALL OIL CHANGES HAVE BEEN DONE REGULARLY AND I HAVE DOCUMENTATION FOR THEM ALL. OUR VEHICLE HAD 74,000 MILES ON IT AND WAS KEPT IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. AS OF NOW, KIA HAS DONE NOTHING TO EXPLAIN WHY NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE ABOUT OUR PROBLEM, AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS WHO HAVE HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM.",
