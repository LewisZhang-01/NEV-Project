THE CAR STOPS STEERING WHEN IN MOTION AND WHEN PARKED AND FIRST STARTED. THE STEERING WHEEL IS CLOSE TO IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN WHEN THIS OCCURS AND IS VERY DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY WHEN THIS HAPPENS IN MOTION. I HAVE HAD IT IN FOR SERVICE AT LEAST 6 TIMES REGARDING THIS ISSUE AND FORD WILL MOTOR CORP IS CLOSING MY CASE WITH NO RESOLVE. THIS IS RECALLED ON THE FUSION FROM THE SAME YEAR FOR THE SAME MALFUNCTION. I FEEL UNSAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE. IT NOW OCCURS DAILY. I ALSO STILL HAVE EXTENDED WARRANTY AND THAT DOES NOT COVER THIS ISSUE APPARENTLY.",
