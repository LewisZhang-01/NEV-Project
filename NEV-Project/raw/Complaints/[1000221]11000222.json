NOW AIRBAG SENSORS SHORTED OUT AND WIRING WAS BURNED. THAT WAS JUST REPLACED HOWEVER MECHANICS CAN'T FIGURE OUT CLICKING NOISE IN STEERING COLUMN THAT CAUSES CRUISE CONTROL AND AIR CONDITIONING TO TURN OFF. THIS HAPPENS FROM TIME TO TIME WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY. 2014 INTERMEDIATE SHAFT RECALL DOES NOT COVER MY CAR. THIS CAR IS A MONEY PIT AND THE RECALLS DO NOT EVER FIX THE ISSUES. I HAVE VIDEO OF THE CLICKING YET NOBODY CAN EXPLAIN IT OR FIX IT. THE CLICKING IS NEW (LAST FEW WEEKS) YET ELECTRICAL ISSUES SHORTING OUT HAS BEEN REOCCURRING FOR YEARS.",
