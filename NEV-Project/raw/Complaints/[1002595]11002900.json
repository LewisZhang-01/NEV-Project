HERE IS A LINK AIRED IN A CANADIAN TV STATIONHTTP://WWW.TVANOUVELLES.CA/2016/07/06/DES-PIRATES-INFORMATIQUES-REINVENTENT-LE-VOL-DE-VOITURES  MY QUESTION IS WHY MANUFACTURER , INSURANCE COMPANY NEVER ADVISE CONSUMER TO TAKE ALTERNATIVE MESURE TOWARD THIS PRACTICE AND WAY TO AVOID TO BE A VICTIM .     THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP AND I JUST HOPE THAT POSTING THIS WILL PREVENT ANY JEEP OWNER TO GET IN MY POSITION .     I FEEL ABANDON BY JEEP AND THE LACK OF INTEREST OF GENERAL PUBLIC IN THOSE CYBER-THEFF THAT WITH ALL THE NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL FIND OUR CAR A LUCRATIVE WAY TO LIVE FROM THEIR CRIME .    NEW CAR ARE HACKABLE , THERE IS SO MANY CASE SHOWING THIS GROWING CONCERN BUT IT MADE ME EVEN MORE SCARED WHEN WHAT SEEM TO BE A \"EASY\" SCAM IS NOT EVEN CONSIDER BY JEEP TO FIXED IT THRUE A PATCH OR JUST WARN CLIENT ABOUT THE NEW RISK .    P.S. MY MAIN LANGUAGE IS FRENCH SO PLEASE DONT JUDGE THIS POST JUST BY ORTOGRAPHE   THIS IS SERIOUS AND NHTSA CAN CONTACT ME WHEN THEY NEED TO IF THEY NEED ANY MORE INFO .",
