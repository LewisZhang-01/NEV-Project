THE SENSOR WOULD GO ON AND OFF INTERMITTENTLY. AFTER SOME TIME, THE AIR BAG WARNING LIGHT CAME ON. I TOOK IT TO THE DEALERSHIP AGAIN A FEW MONTHS AGO AND THEY SAID I NEEDED TO REPLACE THE ENTIRE SENSOR FOR ABOUT $1,200. I WAS UNABLE TO DO THAT (ALSO THINKING THAT IT WOULD FAIL AGAIN). SO, WE ARE DRIVING AROUND WITH WHAT APPEARS IS NO PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG. THERE HAVE BEEN VARIOUS SERVICE BULLETINS FOR THE AIRBAG ISSUE AND NUMEROUS ONLINE COMPLAINTS. I THINK THAT THIS WARRANTS A RECALL.",
