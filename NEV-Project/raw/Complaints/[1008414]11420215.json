I contacted them via phone on 1-23-2021, 2-8-2021, 2-22-2021 and 3-9-2021. I used phone numbers 1-866-891-1233, 1-866-579-0028, and the OnStar button to talk to representatives. I also wrote letters to OnStar dated March 9 and March 27, 2021 without results. I had a confirmation # CN4175174. I never received a bill and now the safety device is cut off in my car.",
