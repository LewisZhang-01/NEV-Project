HOWEVER, I HAVE ONLY DRIVEN APPROX. 19,000 MILES AND 90% OF TREADS ARE GONE. I HAVE CONTACTED THE SELLER, HE TOLD ME TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER. THE MANUFACTURER REFUSED TO HONOR THEIR WARRANTY. I EVEN CONTACTED MY CREDIT CARD CO. TO HELP, BUT THEY REFUSED IT TOO. IT IS DANGEROUS TO DRIVE ON THESE TIRES. I PAID $129.00 PLUS $40.00 FOR INSTALLATION. PLEASE HELP ME GET  MY MONEY BACK.",
