GOOD THING I WAS NEAR A PARKING LOT THAT I COULD GET MY VEHICLE INTO ENOUGH TO GET MY VEHICLE OFF THE MAIN ROAD SO I WAS NOT HIT & INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT. I BOUGHT VEHICLE USED IN APRIL OF 2016 & DO NOT KNOW WHAT WAS DONE N WHAT WAS NOT. MY POWER STEERING WENT OUT ABT A MONTH AGO & IT HAS BEEN SITTING UNDRIVABLE SINCE THEN. A FRIEND THAT IS A MECHANIC FINALLY WAS ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT MY VEHICLE & AFTER JUST TAKING A LOOK AT THE VEHICLE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON, HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING OF ANY RECALL & ADVISED THAT IS WHAT THE ISSUE WRONG WITH MY VEHICLE. HE ADVISED I NEED CHECK INTO THIS TO HAVE FORD TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUE FREE OF CHARGE. I RAN THE VIN # TO CHECK RECALLS ON MY VEHICLE BUT CAME UP NO RECALLS HOWEVER MY VEHICLE FALLS IN THE YEAR OF THE RECALLS. RESEARCHED ONLINE & THERE ARE SEVERAL RECALLS. HOW DO I GO ABOUT THIS & GETTING ALL THE RECALLS TAKEN CARE OF FOR MINE & MY PASSENGERS SAFETY, IF MY VIN # IS SHOWING AS NO RECALL BUT THE RECALL ISSUE HAS HAPPENED TO MY VEHICLE? I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THIS SSAP, AS THIS IS/WAS MY ONLY & MAIN SOURCE OF TRANSPORTAION.",
