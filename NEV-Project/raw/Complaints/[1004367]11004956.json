WE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO UTILIZE THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT FOR OVER A YEAR SO WHEN WE TRAVELED WITH MORE THAN 3 PEOPLE IN THE CAR WE HAD TO TAKE ANOTHER VEHICLE.  I EVENTUALLY GOT MY GRANDCHILDREN FOR THE SUMMER AND ON THEN WAS I TOLD I COULD GET A LOANER VEHICLE SO IN MAY OF 2017  I WAS PROVIDED A LOANER VEHICLE AND MY PARTS CAME IN 2 WEEKS LATER.  THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IT WAS AN INCONVENIENCE AND I FEEL THERE SHOULD BE COMPENSATION FOR THAT.",
