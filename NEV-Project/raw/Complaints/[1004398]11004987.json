THEY TOLD ME IT WOULD COST ME ABOUT $2,000 OUT OF MY POCKET TO REPAIR. I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO REPAIR IT OR BUY ANOTHER VEHICLE BEING ON SOCIAL SECURITY. FORD NEEDS TO RECALL THIS VEHICLE AND REPAIR IT, BUT THEY REFUSE, VERY SAD HOW THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS FLAW AT THE COST OF SMALL CONSUMERS! AFTER READING ON HE INTERNET ABOUT THE HIS, I'M SURE THERE ARE THOUSANDS WITH THIS PROBLEM! THE US GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO STEP IN AND HELP US WITH THIS!",
