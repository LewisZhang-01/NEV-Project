I NEVER EXPECTED TO SEE PLAIN STEEL BRAKE LINES IN A CADILLAC, THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN STAINLESS STEEL AT A MINIMUM. IN MY OPINION THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD AND SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. THE EXHAUST SYSTEM IS STAINLESS STEEL AND IS NOT NEEDED TO STOP THE CAR. I BET HONDA HAS STAINLESS STEEL BRAKE LINES. NO WONDER THAT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE BUYING FOREIGN CARS.",
