HOWEVER, FORD DOES NOT SEEM ABLE TO PROVIDE ME AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY NOT MY CAR SPECIFICALLY.  WAS DRIVING AND WHEN BRAKES WERE APPLIED, THEY FELT LIKE A ROCK...THEN WENT TO FEELING SUPER SOFT,  WITH A HISSING SOUND EVERY TIME THEY WERE APPLIED.  BRAKES ALTERNATED BETWEEN FEELING ROCK HARD TO SUPER SOFT WITH HISSING AND I WAS ALMOST UNABLE TO BRAKE SEVERAL TIMES.  VERY SCARY AND DANGEROUS.  WHEN CAR WAS PARKED (NOT MOVING), BUT TURNED ON AND BRAKE APPLIED, THERE WAS A LOUD SQUEAL SOUND EACH TIME.",
