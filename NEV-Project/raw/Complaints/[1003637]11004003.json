AT OTHER TIMES, IT WILL SLOW TO A COMPLETE STOP.  BEFORE GOING ON VACATION, I TOOK IT TO PANTILI HYUNDAI IN PRINCETON, WV AND THEY DID A COMPUTER UPDATE AND TOLD ME IT WAS FINE.  I DROVE TO MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE AND IT STARTED DOING IT AGAIN.  ON MY WAY HOME, WE STOPPED IN CHATTANOOGA FOR LUNCH. WHEN CROSSING A BUSY INTERSECTION, IT NEARLY STOPPED.  A GAS TRUCK WAS APPROACHING AS WE BARELY MADE IT ACROSS TO OUR SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY.  FORTUNATELY, THERE WAS SHOULDER ROOM TO MOVE TO UNTIL IT DECIDED TO GO AGAIN.",
