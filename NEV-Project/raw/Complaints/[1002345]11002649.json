TOYOTA HAS INFORMED ME THAT THEY NEED TO REPLACE THE AIR BAG (WHICH COULD KILL ME, I LIVE IN THE SOUTH AND IT'S THE AREA MOST LIKELY TO HAVE FAULTY AIRBAGS AS I UNDERSTAND IT).  I UNDERSTAND THE HUGE UNDERTAKING THIS AIRBAG RECALL INVOLVES FOR ALL CAR COMPANIES INCLUDING TOYOTA BUT AT WHAT POINT WILL THIS FAULTY DEADLY EQUIPMENT EVER BE REPLACED?  A YEAR?  FIVE?  IS THERE EVEN A POINT IF A RECALL TAKES SO LONG THE CAR DIES OF OLD AGE FIRST?",
