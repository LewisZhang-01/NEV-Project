I NOTICED THIS TRANSMISSION ISSUE RIGHT AFTER I PICKED UP THE CAR & REPORTED THIS TO THE DEALER. THE CAR/TRANSMISSION SEEMS TO HAVE A MIND OF IT'S OWN. THE DEALER AT THE TIME COULD NOT DUPLICATE THE PROBLEM & TOLD ME WHEN I COULD DUPLICATE IT TO RETURN & HAVE IT CHECKED; WELL THAT'S A LITTLE HARD SINCE THE ISSUE IS NOT PRE-DETERMINED. ON 7/12/2017 AS I WAS STOPPED AT A TRAFFIC LIGHT I REALIZED MY SIDE VISION WAS OBSCURED SLIGHTLY SO I THOUGHT I WOULD EASE UP TOWARDS THE STOP LINE TO CLEAR THE OBSTRUCTED VIEW, I TOOK MY FOOT OFF THE BRAKE SLIGHTLY IN AN EFFORT TO JUST LET THE CAR ROLL A LITTLE UNTIL I CLEARED THE OBSTRUCTED VIEW BUT INSTEAD OF MY CAR JUST ROLLING IT LUNGED FORWARD & SCARED THE LIFE OUT OF ME SO I PRESSED DOWN ON THE BRAKE TO STOP THE CAR. THERE WAS NO ONE IN FRONT OF ME & LUCKILY NO ONE IN BACK OF ME EITHER WHEN THIS HAPPENED.",
