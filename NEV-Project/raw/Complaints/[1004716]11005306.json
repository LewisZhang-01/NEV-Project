AT ABOUT 84,000 MILES, MY ANTIFREEZE LEAKED QUITE EXTENSIVELY, MY ENGINE WAS OVERHEATING.  TOOK TO THE DEALERSHIP, AND MY ENGINE BLOCK WAS CRACKED.  NO RYME OR REASON FOR IT.  I HEARD THAT HONDA GAVE CIVIC OWNERS A 10-YEAR WARRANTY FROM DATE OF PURCHASE BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM.  THIS PROBLEM OCCURRED 10-YEARS AND 3 MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF PURCHASE (MAY 2007).  WHEN THIS OCCURRED, I WAS DOING CITY STREETS AND NOTICED IT WHEN IT WAS STATIONERY.",
