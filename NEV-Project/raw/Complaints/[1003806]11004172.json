        "summary": "INFORMATION REDACTED PURSUANT TO THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(B)(6).    IN EARLY JUNE I WALKED OUT FROM A BOOKSTORE IN OCEANSIDE, CA TO FIND MY WINDSHIELD, ON MY PARKED/STATIONARY PRIUS, HAD ABOUT AN 8 TO 10 INCH CRACK ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. I FILED AN INSURANCE CLAIM WITH AAA AND FOUND THAT WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO USE TWO DIFFERENT VENDORS FOR REPAIR AS WELL AS THE CARLSBAD, CA DEALERSHIP, EACH ONE CONVEYED TO ME THAT THERE IS A NATIONAL SHORTAGE ON PRIUS WINDSHIELDS.  THE CRACK HAS EXPANDED ON ITS OWN AT THIS TIME, MAKING THE CAR UNSAFE TO DRIVE.  IT IS ALMOST ACROSS THE ENTIRE WINDSHIELD.  I'M RENTING A CAR, BUT MY RENTAL WILL EXPIRE ON JULY 20TH.  IF I RENEW THE RENTAL, IT WILL BE AT MY EXPENSE.  ACCORDING TO THE CARLSBAD TOYOTA DEALERSHIP, THE REPLACEMENT WINDSHIELD WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL AUGUST 8TH WHICH IS NEARLY A MONTH AWAY FROM NOW.  THE CLAIM WAS REPORTED IN EARLY JUNE. DUE TO THIS IMMENSE AMOUNT OF INCONVENIENCE CAUSED BY THIS NATIONAL SHORTAGE, I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF TOYOTA CORPORATION WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND PAY FOR MY RENTAL CAR UNTIL THIS ISSUE IS RESOLVED--STARTING JULY 21ST.  FINALLY, PERHAPS THERE NEEDS TO BE A RECALL. YOU CAN E-MAIL ME AT [XXX] AND/OR [XXX].  THANK YOU. *DL",
