        "summary": "HELLO,  IT HAS COME TIME WHERE MY LOYAL SUBARU HAS HAD IT'S FIREWALL SPOT WELDS SNAP OFF AND MY FIREWALL MOVES ABOUT 3 INCHES EVERYTIME I ENGAGED THE CLUTCH OR BRAKES. I REACHED OUT TO SUBARU OF AMERICA WHERE THEY HAD ME GET AN ESTIMATE OF 1750 DOLLARS. WHEN I SENT THEM THE INVOICE THE BEST THEY WOULD COVER IS 750 DOLLARS OF IT. THIS ISSUE IS A SEVERE SAFETY CONCERN ON BEHALF OF MY LIFE AND THE COMPANY ACTED IN BAD FAITH TOWARDS IT'S CUSTOMER.  THE CAR HAD NEVER BEEN BEAT ON OR ABUSED AND FROM JUST SIMPLY DRIVING THE CAR ON A NORMAL BASIS CREATED THIS ISSUE. AT THE TIME THIS HAPPENED I WASN'T AWARE OF THE WHAT WAS AT STAKE. I RESEARCHED THE NUMEROUS PEOPLE FILING CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS SINCE MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE PRODUCTION THIRD GEN WRXS WERE PROBED TO THIS FAULTY FIREWALL WELDS. SUBARU HAS BEEN WELL AWARE OF THIS AND KNEW THAT THIS COULD HAPPEN OR WHEN I EMAILED THEY WOULD HAVE ARGUED AGAINST IT BUT JUST INSTANTLY OFFERED A PORTION OF IT. IN THE BEST INTEREST OF MY SAFETY I FEEL IT'S NECESSARY FOR SUBARU TO PAY THE ENTIRE PORTION OF THE BILL TO ENSURE MY LIFE WILL BE SAFE IN THEIR CAR. IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT YOU COULD DO TO HELP ME THAT WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED.  THANKS FOR YOUR TIME, JEREMY.",
