ASSUMED TO BE RELATED TO PENDING RECALL 20Z4 BUT TRACY VOLKSWAGEN DEALERSHIP IS MAKING THIS A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS AND MADE ME AGREE TO PAY FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC IF THEY THINK ITS NOT RELATED TO THE RECALL.  THEY WOULD NOT AGREE TO CHECK THE RECALL FOR FREE EVEN THOUGH MY CAR IS A GASOLINE BOMB RIGHT NOW.  THIS IS PUTTING ME IN THE MIDDLE BETWEEN VW CORPORATE AND A PRIVATELY OWNED DEALERSHIP WHERE ONE IS SPEAKING VERY NICELY TO ME, AND THE OTHER IS SPEAKING DOWN TO ME.  PLEASE HELP.",
