WHILE DRIVING MY CAR CUT OFF COMPLETELY WITH THE ONLY WARING BEING \"BATTERY SAVER MODE\" THAT OCCURRED LESS THAN 5 MINS PRIOR TO MY CAR SHUTTING OFF.  IT APPEARS THE MY ALTERNATOR FAILED CAUSING ENGINE STALL, THUS INCREASING THE RISK OF CRASH, SINCE NO WARNING IS ISSUED.  HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE COP THAT PULLED UP BEHIND ME, I WOULD HAVE CAUSED AN ACCIDENT ON THAT STREET IN WHICH THE POLICE OFFICER WOULD HAVE BLAMED ME FOR.    MY CAR IS CURRENTLY AT THE DEALERSHIP WITH A \"ALTERNATOR\" REPAIR. THIS REPAIR DOESN'T APPLY TO THE CURRENT RECALL FROM 10/8/2014 BECAUSE I HAVE A 180 AMP ALTERNATOR WITH A 3.6L ENGINE, BUT NOT A 160 AMP ALTERNATOR WITH A 3.6L ENGINE.",
