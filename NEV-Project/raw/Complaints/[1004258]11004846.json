        "summary": "SINCE I HAVE OWNED THE VEHICLE (2013) THERE HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS WITH GETTING THE CAR RUNNING AGAIN. FIRST WHILE IN MOTION THE VEHICLE WOULD TREMOR (IN THE FRONT) BEFORE SHUTTING DOWN, PARTICULARLY IF  GOING ABOVE 25-30 MPH. WHEN THE CAR WAS SHUT OFF BY KEY IGNITION AND TURNED BACK ON IT WOULD START AGAIN. CODES FOR OXYGEN SENSOR WOULD COME UP, HAD THAT FIXED. PROBLEM BEGAN AGAIN A FEW MONTHS LATER. MULTIPLE TIMES WHILE DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY/OPEN ROAD THE SENSORS ON THE PANEL ALL LITE UP AND THE CAR SHUT DOWN. I HAD THE ALTERNATOR REPLACED TWICE FOR THIS ISSUE; THINKING THAT WAS THE PROBLEM. PRIOR TO THE SECOND ALTERNATOR REBUILD/REPLACEMENT THE FUEL GAUGE WOULD FLUCTUATE AFTER REACHING HALF A TANK. MOST OF THE TIME IT WOULD READ EMPTY WHEN THE TANK WAS HALF FULL; OR EMPTY WHEN THE TANK IS FULL. I NOTICED THE GAUGE WOULD DROP IF A TURN WAS MADE OR THE CAR HIT A BUMP/POT HOLE IN THE CITY STREET/HIGHWAY. I ATTEMPTED TO REPLICATE CONDITIONS TO GET THE GAUGE TO GO BACK TO NORMAL, THIS DID NOT ALWAYS WORK.OCCASIONALLY IT WOULD WAVE AROUND WHILE DRIVING. THE CAR BEGAN TO READ CODE FOR FUEL SYSTEM ISSUES. HAD THIS TESTED, FUEL SYSTEM WAS FINE; YET PROBLEM CONSISTED. WITH A HALF FULL TANK, THE CAR WOULD REPEATEDLY READ EMPTY, NOT ALLOW ANY ADDITIONAL GAS TO BE PUT INTO THE TANK (WOULD CUT OFF AT PUMP AS IF TANK WERE FULL), AND SHUT DOWN WHILE DRIVING IN DIFFERENT ROAD CONDITIONS AS IF THERE WERE NO GAS IN THE CAR. RIGHT NOW THE GAS GAUGE CONTINUES TO READ EMPTY WHEN THERE IS GAS IN THE TANK, I HAVE TROUBLE FILLING THE TANK AS IT CUTS OFF THE PUMP REPEATEDLY NOT ALLOWING NEW GAS TO BE PUT IN, THE CAR CUTS OFF OFTEN WHILE DRIVING.",
