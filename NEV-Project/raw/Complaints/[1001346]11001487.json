WE HAVE BEEN IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH HYUNDAI SINCE THAN WITH NO RESOLUTION.  WE HAVE BEFORE THE CAR GOT FIXED AND AFTER THE CAR GOT FIXED PICTURES OF THE AIRBAGS AND YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE WHERE SOMEONE HAD TAMPERED WITH THEM.  MY CAR HAS BEEN SITTING IN OUR DRIVEWAY SINCE MAY 4TH NOT BEING DRIVEN BECAUSE WE DON'T FEEL SAFE DRIVING IT NOT KNOWING IF THE AIRBAGS ARE GOING TO WORK IF WE NEED THEM TOO AND WE WERE TOLD TO NOT USE IT BY HYUNDAI UNTIL SOMEONE FROM HYUNDAI COULD COME AND INSPECT THE CAR, WHICH THEY NEVER DID.  I ALSO HAVE ALL THE PHONE CALLS WE HAVE EVER MADE TO HYUNDAI WRITTEN DOWN INCLUDING TIMES, DATES, WHO WE TALKED TO AND WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT,  ALL THE EMAILS SENT BACK AND FORTH WITH HYUNDAI WE ALSO HAVE PRINTED.  IT HAS GOTTEN TO A PINT NOW THAT WE ACTUALLY GOT THE BBB AND THE NORTH CAROLINA STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL INVOLVED.  I HAVE INCLUDED THE PICTURES MY HUSBAND TOOK OF THE DRIVERS SIDE AND PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAGS.",
