IT WOULD CUT OFF AT TIMES WHILE DRIVING ON BUSY CITY STREETS, JUST BEFORE TOTALLY SHUTTING DOWN.THOUGHT IT WAS THE BATTERY AND HAD THAT REPLACED. NOTHING ELSE WAS READING AS AN ISSUE THAT WOULD CAUSE THIS PROBLEM. I KNEW IT WAS LARGER PROBLEM WHEN I WAS UNABLE TO JUMP START MY VEHICLE OR FEED IT GAS USING THE PEDAL. CAR NO LONGER STARTS. APPARENTLY I NO LONGER HAVE POWER TO MY FUEL PUMP, AND THE RELAY IS INTEGRATED INTO  THE FUSE BOX. UPON DOING SOME RESEARCH THIS IS A COMMON ISSUE THAT CAUSES THE VEHICLE TO RANDOMLY SHUT OFF. DEALERSHIPS WANT $1200 TO FIX.",
