THE VIBRATION CAN BE FELT THROUGH THE SEAT AND STEERING WHEEL.  THE FREQUENCY AND SOUND LEVEL IS NOT DEPENDENT ON SPEED, LOAD OR ROAD CONDITIONS.  IT'S ALWAYS THERE.  I'M TAKING IT BACK TO THE CHEVROLET DEALER AGAIN TOMORROW FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF ATTEMPTED REPAIRS.  AT FIRST THE DEALER SAID THE VIBRATION AND NOISE WAS NORMAL.  AFTER SHOWING THEM A COPY OF THE GM SERVICE BULLETIN ' PI1354C, THEY NOW ADMIT TO A POTENTIAL ISSUE.  STILL NOT SOLUTION.",
