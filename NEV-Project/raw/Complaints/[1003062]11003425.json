IT ALSO SHOWS ON THE PANEL UNDER THE AIR CONDITIONER CONTROLS THAT THE PASSENGER AIR BAG IS OFF.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND IT IS DUE TO A FAULTY SAFETY RESTRAINT SYSTEM SENSOR THE IN THE PASSENGER BOTTOM SEAT.  INFINITI HAS HAD RECALLS AND ISSUES WITH THIS SRS SYSTEM IN THE PASSENGER SEAT WHILE THEY DID NOT RECALL THE 2011 INFINITI G37.  MY G37 HAS APPROXIMATELY 23,500 MILES AND THEY WANT OVER $5,000.00 TO REPLACE THE WHOLE SEAT BOTTOM.  THIS IS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AND SOMEONE NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.  TO TOP THINGS OFF, MY DASH IS MELTING AND I KNOW THEY HAD A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IN FLORIDA WITH NISSAN MELTING DASHBOARDS IN 2008.  I GUESS THIS COULD ALSO BE A SAFETY ISSUE SINCE THE DASH IS STICKY AND HOT AND IF A CHILD WERE TO TOUCH IT THEY COULD POSSIBLY GET BURNED NOT TO MENTION THE MESS.  INFINITI CONSUMER AFFAIRS SAID THEY WOULD NOT REMEDY EITHER ISSUE.  WHAT A QUALITY PRODUCT......I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER NISSAN/INFINITI VEHICLE AND HAVE OWNED 5.",
