MY WIFE AND I TOOK A TRIP THIS PAST WEEKEND IN THE CAR AND I NOTICED THE VHICLE'S PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG TELLTALE LIGHT INDICATING THE AIRBAG WAS OFF WHILE MY WIFE WAS SEATED IN THE PASSENGER SEAT. ON MONDAY 06/19/2017 I CALLED WILKINSON GM IN SANFORD TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT. I WAS SCHEDULED FOR FRIDAY 06/23/2017 AT 1:00 PM. I TOOK THE CAR IN AND DESCRIBED THE PROBLEM. AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR I WAS TOLD THEY COULD NOT DO ANYTHING AS THERE WAS NO STORED CODE AND THEY COULD NOT REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM. AND I WILL NEED TO WAIT UNTIL GM HAS A PERMANENT SOLUTION. I QUESTIONED WHAT THEY WOULD DO IF THE PROBLEM WAS FOUND AND WAS TOLD THEY WOULD REPLACE THE PRESSURE SWITCH UNDER SEAT BUT THEY WERE NOT WILLING TO UNTIL THEY WERE ABLE TO SEE TELLTALE LIGHT FOR AIRBAG GO OFF.   THE TELLTALE INDICATING LIGHT WENT OFF WHILE WE WERE DRIVING, IN MARION ON SECONDARY ROADS AND HIGHWAY ROADS. TO MY KNOWLEDGE THE DEALER MECHANIC ONLY TRIED TO REPRODUCE SYMPTOMS IN THE GARAGE SITTING STILL.",
