I WAS STANDING OUTSIDE THE CAR, AND AS I OPENED THE DRIVER'S DOOR TO GET IN, THE BOTTOM CORNER OF DOOR GOUGED MY LOWER LEFT LEG AND PEELED BACK A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF TISSUE.  UPON CLOSER INSPECTION, I OBSERVED THAT THIS PIECE OF BLACK TRIM (WHICH COVERS THE ENTIRE BOTTOM SIDE OF THE ESCAPE) IS DESIGNED TO FLARE OUT TO A SHARP POINT ON BOTH FRONT DOORS OF THE ESCAPE.  IN MY OPINION, THIS IS A GROSSLY NEGLIGENT DESIGN.  IT BORDERS ON AN INTENTIONALLY SUBSTANDARD DESIGN, ELEVATING THE CONTINUITY OF THE BLACK TRIM ABOVE SAFETY CONCERNS. IN MY OPINION, THAT HAZARDOUS POINT FAILS TO MEET EVEN THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD REQUIREMENTS OF A COMMERCIALLY FIT AND MERCHANTABLE VEHICLE.    RESULT:  TEN STITCHES TO REPAIR MY LEG; TETANUS SHOT; ORAL ANTIBIOTICS; COMPLETE DISRUPTION TO QUALITY OF LIFE AS MOBILITY IS AN ISSUE AND I ATTEMPT TO KEEP THE WOUND CLEAN, DRY AND UNINFECTED.",
