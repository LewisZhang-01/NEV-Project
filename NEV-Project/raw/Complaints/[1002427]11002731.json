ANOTHER CRACK STARTING AT THE MIDDLE OF THE DASH, GOING THROUGH THE DASH MOUNTED SPEAKER OPENING FROM THE FRONT VENTS ALL THE WAY TO THE WOOD TRIM ABOVE THE RADIO (6-8\").   ANOTHER CRACK TO THE FRONT LEFT OF THE AIRBAG, APPROX 2\" LONG.  RATTLING ON EVERY LITTLE BUMP.  I BELIEVE THIS HAS ALSO COMPROMISED SOME OF THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS THAT CONTROL THE DOOR LOCKS AND WINDOWS.    SEVERAL OF THE CRACKS WERE NOTICED IN THE MORNING BEFORE MOVING THE VEHICLE AND WERE NOT SEEN THE PREVIOUS NIGHT.",
