I IMMEDIATELY PULLED OVER TO FIND THAT MY PANORAMIC SUNROOF HAD EXPLODED.  I HAD JUST MADE A TURN, SO I WAS NOT GOING FAST, MAYBE 30-35 MPH, IT WAS A COOL SPRING MORNING, NOT OVERLY HOT OR COLD, THERE WAS NO PRECIPITATION, NO EXTREME TEMPERATURES.  I CALLED THE HYUNDAI DEALER WE BOUGHT THE VEHICLE FROM, AND THEY SAID IT WAS NOT A DEFAULT IN THE VEHICLE, IT WAS NOT THEIR FAULT, AND THEY WOULD NOT REPLACE IT.",
