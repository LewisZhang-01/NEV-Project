        "summary": "HELLO,  THE VEHICLE IS UNDER 60,000 MILES. I RECEIVED A RECALL NOTICE FOR THE MALFUNCTION LIGHT. AFTER DIAGNOSIS, IT WAS REPORTED THE CAR BURNED OIL AND CAUSED OIL SLUDGE. MANY REPORTS ARE NEEDED TO BE REPLACED, INCLUDING THE PISTONS AND RINGS. THE COST OF THE JOB IS BETWEEN $4500 - 6000. GM WILL NOT REPAIR THE CAR UNDER THE BULLETIN, 15285C.    APPARENTLY, THE CAR VIN IS COVERED; HOWEVER, GM WILL NOT REPAIR BECAUSE I CAN'T PROOF CHANGING OIL EVERY 5,000 MILES. I DO HAVE SERVICE PROVIDER RECEIPTS DATING BACK TO 2012. I COULDN'T PROOF CHANGING THE OIL MYSELF. I HAVE COMPLETED THIS TASKS IN ADDITION TO THE SERVICE SHOP.    GM REPORTED THE CAR TO BURN OIL EXCESSIVELY AT 2,000 MILES. I WASN'T AWARE OF THIS UNTIL 2016, FIVE YEARS AFTER TIME OF PURCHASE. I'M DISAPPOINTED WITH GM NOT BACKING THEIR PRODUCT.    THE CAR HAS THE FOLLOWING ISSUES DUE TO THIS RECALL.  -LUNGES AT IDLE  -STOPS AT IDLE  -SOUNDS LIKE A TICKING TIME BOMB    I HAVE ALREADY INVESTED $1200 IN THE ENGINE FIXING THE TIMING CHAIN AND WATER PUMP.    ATTACHED IS A CONVERSATION SAVED WITH GM SUPPORT.    THANKS,  CHAD",
