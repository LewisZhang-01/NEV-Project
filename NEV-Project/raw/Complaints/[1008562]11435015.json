The car is available for inspection upon request.      I am put at risk because there are multiple system malfunctions that occur that could result in a wreck or injury. The brakes selectively illuminating can result in a rear end collision and is not safe for travel. The traction control malfunction is unsafe for safe travel on the road.        When the problem occurs the TSC will disengage with a light on the dashboard. The brake lights will stay illuminated.",
