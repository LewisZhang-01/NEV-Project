IT TURNS OUT IT'S THE SBC PUMP WHICH WAS RECALLED BY MERCEDES BENZ. EXCEPT, BENZ WILL NOT REPAIR IT AS IT'S A 2003 AND OUT OF THEIR 10 YEAR RULE. IT'S A $2100 I CANNOT AFFORD AND CANNOT SELL VEHICLE WITH THIS ISSUE AS I FEAR IT MAY CAUSE HARM TO OTHERS. A FRIEND SUGGESTED I ASK FOR NHTSA'S HELP AS BENZ IS UNWILLING TO STAND BY THE RECALL AND REPAIR THE SAFETY ISSUE.",
