        "summary": "WE HAVE A 2008 GMC ACADIA THAT NOW HAS APPROXIMATELY 164,000 MILES. IT WAS RECENTLY FOUND OUT THAT A WATER LEAK HAS CAUSED THE AIRBAG SYSTEM TO BE COME COMPLETELY DISABLED. WATER LEAKS IN THESE MODEL VEHICLES ARE A KNOWN ISSUE AND GM HAS PUT OUT TECHNICAL SERVICE BULLETINS ABOUT THESE LEAKS AND HOW TO FIX THEM. BECAUSE OUR VEHICLE IS OVER THE MILEAGE LIMIT THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP IS SAYING GM WILL NOT WARRANTY THE LEAK REPAIR OR THE DAMAGE TO THE AIRBAG SYSTEM FROM THE LEAK. WE ARE NOW FACED WITH A BILL OF $1600 TO REPAIR THE AIRBAG SYSTEM AND UNKNOWN AMOUNT TO REPAIR THE WATER LEAK AND ANY OTHER DAMAGE CAUSED BY IT TO THE VEHICLE. WHAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IS WHY A LEAKING SUNROOF WITH ADMITTED FACTORY DEFECT ISSUES FROM THE MANUFACTURE HAS A MILEAGE LIMIT FOR WARRANTY REPAIRS. I CAN UNDERSTAND A TIME LIMIT. THIS ISSUE HAS NOW MADE OUR VEHICLE COMPLETELY UNSAFE FOR MY FAMILY TO DRIVE AND RIDE IN.",
