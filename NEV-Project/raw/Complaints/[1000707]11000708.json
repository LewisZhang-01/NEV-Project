FRIDAY 6/10/2017 WAS DRIVING HOME TURNING LEFT IN A BUSY INTERSECTION  AND HEAR A LOUD PING PING FROM UNDER THE HOOD, AND I CAN NO LONGER ACCELERATE. CARS ARE HOOKING BEHIND ME AS I TURN ON MY HAZARDS AND AM ABLE TO FINALLY COAST TO THE SIDE STREET AND TURN OFF THE CAR. I WAS ALMOST REAR ENDED TWICE.   TOOK THE CAR INTO THE DEALER. THEY BROKE DOWN THE ENGINE AND SAID THAT THEY ENGINE SEIZED UP AND THE BEARINGS HAD METAL SHAVING ALL OVER DOWN TO THE OIL PAN. THEY SAID THIS LOOKED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN SEEING IN THE RECALLED 2.4 L ENGINES. THEY FILED A CLAIM WITH HYUNDAI  SINCE I AM THE SECOND OWNER THE ARE DECLINING THE REPAIR REQUEST BECAUSE I AM THE SECOND OWNER AND HAVE 80,000 MILES. SO MUCH FOR HELPING YOUR CUSTOMER THAT WAS ALMOST KILLS BECAUSE OF ENGINE FAILURE",
