        "summary": "SINCE LEASING THIS VEHICLE ON DECEMBER 1, 2016, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS SAFETY ISSUES WITH THE SEAT BELT, ERRONEOUS WARNING ALARMS, AND THE WINDSHIELD WIPER.    FIRST, WHILE DRIVING IN A SNOW STORM IN JANUARY 2017, THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDSHIELD WIPER WENT FLYING OFF THE VEHICLE. THE DEALERSHIP REPAIRED THE WINDSHIELD WIPER.     SECOND, WHILE DRIVING ON VARIOUS DATES/TIMES, THE CAR BEGAN SOUNDING AN ALARM AND A MESSAGE APPEARED THAT THE KEY WAS NOT IN THE VEHICLE.  PLEASE SEE THE ATTACHED VIDEO.  THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE SHOP ON TWO DIFFERENT OCCASIONS.  DURING THE FIRST OCCASION, THE PUSH BUTTON WAS REPLACED.  ON THE SECOND OCCASION, THE DEALERSHIP INDICATED THEY COULD NOT REPLICATE THE PROBLEM.  THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONCERN BECAUSE THE CAR DISPLAYS THIS ALARM AT RANDOM TIMES DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE KEY IS IN THE VEHICLE.  THE ALARM IS DISTRACTING WHILE DRIVING.    LASTLY, ON ANOTHER OCCASION, THE SEAT BELT WENT INTO THE SEAT MECHANISM PREVENTING THE DRIVER FROM USING THE SEAT BELT.  THIS WAS ALSO REPAIRED BY MERCEDES-BENZ.",
