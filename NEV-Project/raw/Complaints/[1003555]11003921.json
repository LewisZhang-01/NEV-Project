THE PLASTIC CLIPS THAT HOLD THE BUMPER ARE NOT HOLDING! MY CAR IS IN GRATE/EXCELLENT CONDITION. IT APPEARS TO BE A POORLY ASSEMBLED AND/OR DESIGNE DEFECT MADE BY THE MANUFACTURE SINCE I WAS DRIVE THE HIGHWAY SPEED LIMIT. I AM ON VACATION HEADED TO SOUTH DAKOTA FROM CALIFORNIA AND THIS PUTS MYSELF, PASSENGER,  AND OTHER DRIVERS ON THE HIGHWAY IN DANGER IF IT COMPLETELY DETACHES!",
