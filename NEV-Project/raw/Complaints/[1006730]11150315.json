        "summary": "I BOUGHT A KIA SPORTAGE IN 2015, PAID CASH FOR THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE EVERYONE RAVED HOW THESE VEHICLES ARE SO GOOD AND DEPENDABLE, HAD THE VEHICLE FOR 3 YRS, AND MY ENGINE BLEW. I LEARNED ABOUT A RECALL FOR SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF KIA'S HOWEVER UNFORTUNATELY MY ENGINE ISN'T COVERED UNDER THE RECALL. WHICH IS CONFUSING TO ME BECAUSE MY ENGINE IS THE SAME THAT'S IN THE OPTIMA WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE RECALL JUST DIFFERENT BODY STYLE. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 15 MILLION KIA CUSTOMERS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING THIS SAME DILEMMA. AND TO FIND OUT KIA ISN'T GOING TO HELP ME REPLACE MY MOTOR! THIS IS RIDICULOUS THERE ARE OVER 15 MILLION RECALLS FOR THIS ISSUE, AND KIA KNEW THESE MOTORS WERE BAD AND STILL SOLD THE VEHICLES. FOR SOMEONE WHO IS SINGLE LIKE MYSELF AND RELY ON DRIVING SOMETHING DEPENDABLE AND CAN'T AFFORD SOMETHING ELSE OR THE OUTSTANDING AMOUNT FOR THE REPAIRS, KIA LEAVES ME WITH NOTHING. NOW DO I NOT ONLY HAVE NOTHING TO DRIVE, HAVE TO GETS RIDES TO WORK, AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO COME UP WITH OVER 5, 000 DOLLARS TO FIX THIS ISSUE, I GUESS IT'S A MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ME. THANK YOU KIA !!!",
