        "summary": "IN MY 2011 JEEP COMPASS THAT I PURCHASED FROM DAVE SYVERSON' S IN ALBERT LEA MINNESOTA IN 2015 HAS HAD NUMEROUS ISSUES WITH THE TRANSMISSION STARTING IN LESS THAN A YEAR FROM THE PURCHASE DATE.  THE FIRST TIME WAS WHEN I WAS COMING HOME, UP MY GRADUAL HILL, WHEN MY CAR STOPPED BEING ABLE TO DRIVE MORE THAN 10 MPH AND ALL OF MY GEARS WERE OUT UP (P, N, D, R). IT WAS \"FIXED\" BECAUSE MY WIRING TO MY TRANSMISSION WAS COMPLETELY CORRODED.  NOT ONCE DID THE LEAPING OF MY CAR STOP, THE FEELING OF THE CAR PUSHING THROUGH GEARS ON IT'S IN WHILE IN MOTION. IN THE WINTER MONTHS I TOOK MY CAR IN TO HAVE THE LEAPING LOOKED AT, THE SHOP SAID THERE WAS NOTHING TO FIX.  HOWEVER THIS JUNE I WAS DRIVING NORTH ON HIGHWAY 35 WHEN AN OIL TEMPERATURE GAUGE CAME ON. I STOPPED, HAD IT TOWED, THE SHOP I HAD TO GO TO CHECKED TRANSMISSION FLUID AND FILTER (AFTER I CALLED FIVE TIMES TO TELL THEM TO CHECK THESE THINGS) THEY SAID IT NEEDED REPLACED. I DROVE MY CAR TO THE JEEP DEALER AND IT WAS REPLACED AFTER TWO WEEKS OF NOT HAVING A CAR.  MY CAR WAS GIVEN A PRETTY CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH.  HOWEVER LAST NIGHT (JUNE 30TH, 2017) I WAS DRIVING HOME 8 MILES AND WHEN ACCELERATING FROM A RED LIGHT IT WAS LIKE I WAS STUCK IN NEUTRAL AND MY RPMS REVVED HIGH BUT I WAS GOING NO WHERE.  I PULLED OVER AND LEFT MY CAR IN A SAFE SPOT.  MY TRANSMISSION HAS CLEARLY STOPPED WORKING FOR WHATEVER REASON.",
