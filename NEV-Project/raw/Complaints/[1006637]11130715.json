THE FRONT END STARTS BOUNCING AND THE TRUCK WILL BASICALLY BOUNCE SIDEWAYS. THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED I WAS PREPARED AND COME CLOSE TO LOSING CONTROL. IT WILL BOUNCE OR WOBBLE GOING 40 MPH JUST AS BAD AS DOING 55 OR 60. I WILL NOT LET MY WIFE DRIVE IT ON ANY HIGHWAY, ONLY AROUND TOWN BECAUSE I AM SCARED TO DEATH SHE MIGHT LOSE CONTROL AND WRECK OR LOSE CONTROL AND HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE. IT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME AND SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE.",
