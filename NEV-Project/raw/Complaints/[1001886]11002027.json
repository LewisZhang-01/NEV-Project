THIS INCIDENT ALMOST COST ME MY LIFE AS WELL AS TWO OF MY CHILDREN (WHO ARE ADULTS). IT COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF A LOT OF TRAFFIC CAUSING A SEMI TRUCK TO MISS US BY INCHES. THIS HAS ALSO HAPPENED ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS ON STREETS AND IN PARKING LOTS. THE CAR IS ALWAYS IN MOTION WHEN THIS OCCURS. I HAVE HAD THE CAR'S ENGINE TESTED (THE BUSINESS THAT TESTED IT IS NOW OUT OF BUSINESS). THE TEST REVEALED THAT IT WAS A COIL PACK THAT WAS CAUSING THE PROBLEM. I HAD THE COIL PACK REPLACED BUT IT DID NOT FIX THE PROBLEM. AT THIS POINT IT IS STILL UNKNOWN WHY MY VEHICLE SHUTS DOWN RANDOMLY. BELOW IT ASKS FOR A DATE WHEN THIS OCCURS. AS STATED ABOVE, IT HAS HAPPENED SO MANY TIMES THAT I CAN'T RECALL THOSE DATES, SO I PUT IN AN APPROXIMATE DATE THAT THE INCIDENT ON THE HIGHWAY OCCURRED. THE MILES ON THE CAR IS WHAT I HAVE ON IT AT THIS TIME (149,542).",
