THEN, JUST A COUPE WEEKS AGO IN JUNE 2017, THE AIRBAG LIGHT CAME ON WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING TO WORK ON THE HIGHWAY, AND THE LIGHT HAS NOT GONE OFF SINCE. WE TOOK IT TO A LOCAL AUTO SHOP TO DIAGNOSE THIS PAST WEEKEND, AND THEY SAID IT WAS AN ISSUE RELATING TO THE AIRBAG RECALL SERVICE--THEY SAID THEY'VE SEEN THIS NUMEROUS TIMES NOW, ALL IN VEHICLES THAT HAD THE AIRBAG RECALL SERVICE DONE. SOME OF THE COMMON RED FLAGS THEY MADE US AWARE OF WERE: HORN IS NOT WORKING, AS WELL AS THE CRUISE CONTROL. WE TOOK IT TO PALM BEACH TOYOTA IN WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA, THIS MORNING, AND THEY DIAGNOSED IT AS A SPIRAL CABLE ASSEMBLY THAT NEEDS TO BE REPLACED--AT A COST TO US OF $700 PLUS TAX. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE RECALL, SINCE IT APPEARS TO BE SUCH A COMMON OCCURANCE, IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THIS STEMS FROM THE AIRBAG RECALL SERVICE.",
