        "summary": "WHILE DRIVING, MY ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND I GOT AN ALERT THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE ENGINE CONTROL MODULE.  I MADE AN APPOINTMENT  ASAP BUT CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE CAR UNTIL MY APPOINTMENT IN 4 DAYS.  LATER ON THAT DAY, I WAS I FULLY STOPPED IAT A FLASHING YELLOW LIGHT, THEN ATTEMPTED TO CROSS OVER A LANE OF TRAFFIC.  THE CAR MOVED BUT WOULD NOT ACCELERATE PAST 12 MPH - ALMOST CAUSING ME TO BE HIT BY ONCOMING TRAFFIC.  I HAD TO TURN MY HAZARD LIGHTS ON AND COAST UNTIL I COULD PULL OVER.  I CALLED HYUNDAI AND THEY EXPEDITED MY APPOINTMENT BUT CLAIMED THERE ARE NO ACTIVE RECALLS.  HOWEVER THE TECHNICIAN SAID THAT THERE IS A \"CAMPAIGN\"  AND THAT HE REPLACED THE PART. THEIR WEBSITE SAYS THIS:  SONATA 2.4L ECM UPDATE & VCM (16-01-064)     I ALMOST GOT HIT BY ONCOMING TRAFFIC BECAUSE OF THIS ECM ISSUE AND I THINK THAT HYUNDAI IS PUTTING PEOPLE IN DANGER BY DOWNPLAYING THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS ISSUE.  IT SHOULD BE A RECALL - NOT A \"CAMPAIGN\" AND THEY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY CAR OWNERS TO GET THIS ISSUE RESOLVED ASAP.  IT COULD BE A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH.",
