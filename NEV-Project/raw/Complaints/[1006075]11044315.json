IT STIL LOOSES POWER WHILE IN MOTION FROM 45MPH TO 70MPH. HAVE HAD MANY REPAIRS DONE CLAIMING TO FIX THE PROBLEM AND NOTHING HAS WORKED. DEALERSHIP KEEPS SAYING THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS. WHEN IT LOOSE ALL POWER I HAVE APPROX. 20 SECONDS TO MAKE IT TO THE SHOULDER. HAVE ALMOST BEEN HIT SEVERAL TIMES ON THE FREEWAY. THIS HAPPENS ON A DAILY BASIS. MY HUSBAND AND I FEEL LIKE IT MAY BE AN ELECTRICAL SHORTAGE SOMEWHERE THAT NO ONE CAN SEEM TO FIND",
