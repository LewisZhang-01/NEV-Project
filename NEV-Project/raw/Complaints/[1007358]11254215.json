        "summary": "I WOULD LIKE TO FILE A COMPLAINT DUE TO A FAULTY OCS SENSOR ON MY 2008 SONATA (ERROR CODE B1448). THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE HYUNDAI INITIATED CAMPAIGN 083 TO ADDRESS. IN THIS CASE THE DEALERSHIP HUFFINES HYUNDAI DID FIX THE PROBLEM BY SENDING THE WHOLE SEAT OUT TO HAVE THE SENSOR REPROGRAMED.  HOWEVER THIS SAME SENSOR FAILED AGAIN. THE DEALERSHIP CLAIMED THAT THEY CAN'T REPROGRAM THE SENSOR AGAIN AND OFFERED TO FIX IT AGAIN AT MY COST (EXTREMELY HIGH COST).   THEY ARE CLAIMING THAT UNDER CAMPAIGN 083 THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO ONLY REPAIR/REPROGRAMMING THE OCS SENSOR ONCE.     THIS IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE SINCE THIS OCS SENSOR FAILED AND THE COMPLETE AIRBAG SYSTEM IS COMPROMISED AND WON'T ACTIVATE IN AN ACCIDENT. I ESCALATED THIS ISSUE TO HYUNDAI CORPORATE CUSTOMER CARE RESOLUTION TEAM AND THEY ECHOED THE SAME COMMENTS AS THE DEALERSHIP.  THEIR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO ONLY TO REPAIR/REPROGRAMMING THE OCS SENSOR ONCE. I ASKED TO HAVE THIS ESCALATED THE NEXT LEVEL AND THIS PERSON BASICALLY SAID NO AND HE WOULDN'T ESCALATE IT. AFTER DOING SOME LENGTHY RESEARCH THERE IS NO OTHER SAFE WAY TO HAVE THIS FIXED OTHER THAN GOING THROUGH THE DEALERSHIP AT HIGH COST TO ME OR ANY OTHERS.      THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE WITH THE OCS SENSOR,  HYUNDAI KNOWS IT'S PRONE TO FAILURE. THEY DON'T REPLACE THE SENSOR, JUST REPROGRAM THE SAME FAULTY SENSOR AND THEN WON'T FIX IT IF IT FAILS AGAIN.  THIS SEEMS TO BE A DECISION BY HYUNDAI TO PUT PROFITS BEFORE CUSTOMER SAFETY.     WHY WAS THIS NOT A FULL GOVERNMENT FORCED RECALL? WAS HYUNDAI GETTING AROUND THE RECALL RULES BY ISSUING A CAMPAIGN? CAMPAIGN 083 EFFECTED CLOSE TO 400,000 VEHICLES.",
