THIS MAKES FOR A VERY SCARY SITUATION FOR ME AND MY FAMILY WHEN DRIVING IN THE EVENING AND IT ALL GETS DARK. WE NOTICE WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION, CITY STREET OR HIGHWAY, WE COULD BE IN THE CAR FOR SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME OR LONGER AMOUNT OF TIME, WARM AND COLD WEATHER, WET AND DRY WEATHER, HAVEN'T NOTICED WHILE TURNING BUT HAVE ON STRAIGHT ROADS, DASHBOARD GOES DARK TOO WHEN THE HEADLIGHTS GO OUT.   THE LOCAL KIA DEALERSHIP CANNOT REPLICATE THE ISSUE SINCE IT IS VERY RANDOM IN NATURE.  THIS HAS HAPPENED A NUMBER OF TIMES OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO INJURIES DUE TO THIS YET.",
