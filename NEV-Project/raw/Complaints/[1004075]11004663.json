WARNING LIGHT ILLUMINATED AND WAS ABLE TO DRIVE TO A SAFE PLACE TO STOP BEFORE THE ALTERNATOR STARTED SMOKING. POWDERED EXTINGUISHER DID NOT STOP THE SMOKE SO HAD TO CALL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. THEIR LIQUID FLAME RETARDANT WAS ABLE TO COOL THE ALTERNATOR AND PREVENT THE FIRE FROM SPREADING. JEEP HAS A CURRENT RECALL FOR THE 160 AMP ALTERNATOR, BUT I HAVE THE 180 AMP ALTERNATOR. I REPORTED THE ISSUE TO JEEP AND THEY WERE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT THEY HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED AN INVESTIGATION FOR THIS ISSUE. THIS IS THE EXACT SAME FAILURE AS IS DESCRIBED IN THE 160 AMP ALTERNATOR RECALL AND THE ISSUE WAS FIXED THE SAME WAY, BY REPLACING THE ALTERNATOR. PLEASE MAKE JEEP EXPAND THE RECALL BEFORE SOMEONE DIES IN A FIRE OR ACCIDENT DUE TO THIS ISSUE. IF I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY AS I WAS OVER THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STOP IN A SAFE PLACE AS QUICKLY AND DEFINITELY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A QUICK FIRE RESPONSE!",
