WHILE DRIVING, BARELY TOUCHING THE GAS PEDAL THE CAR GAINS SPEED QUICKLY WITHOUT HAVING TO USE THE PEDALS, HAVE TO KEEP MY FOOT ON THE BRAKES THE ENTIRE TIME TO KEEP IT STEADY - ITS ACCELERATING BY ITSELF AND TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT TO KEEP IT STOPPED. ALMOST CAUSED ME TO CRASH 3 TIMES TODAY OUT OF THE BLUE, ONCE WHILE AT A RED LIGHT WITH FOOT ON BRAKES THE RPMS RAN UP TO 3000 AND TRIED TO DRIVE THROUGH THE BRAKES, AND TWICE WHILE ON CITY STREETS IT ACCELERATED FROM 20 TO 50 IN SECONDS, CAUSING ME TO NEARLY MISS A VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME. WHY MY MODEL VIN ISN'T INCLUDED IN THE RECALL I DON'T KNOW, BECAUSE LOOKING AT EVERYTHING ONLINE REGARDING THE 05 TAURUS MY CAR HAS ALL THE SAME ISSUES, WHICH WEREN'T DISCLOSED TO ME UPON PURCHASE BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL OWNER HAD NO IDEA. CURRENT MILEAGE 186K.",
