WHEN YOU FLOOR THE GAS PEDAL (AND REALLY NEED THE TRUCK TO MOVE FOR SAFETY, TO CLEAR AN INTERSECTION OR MERGE) THERE IS NO RESPONSE.  KNOWING TRUCKS LIKE I DO, THIS VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH POWER TO MOVE SWIFTLY BUT INSTEAD IT JUST CRAWLS DUE TO ELECTRONIC REGULATION ON THE MOTOR.  THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY CONCERN.",
