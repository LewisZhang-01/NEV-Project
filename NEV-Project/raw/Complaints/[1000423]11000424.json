        "summary": "WE WERE NOTIFIED THAT A RECALL FOR THE POWER STEERING ON MY DAUGHTER'S CAR WAS RECALLED. SHE WAS SITING IN A PARKING LOT AND THE \"SERVICE POWER STEERING NOW\" LIGHT CAME ON AND SHE COULDN'T STEER THE CAR. SO SHE CALLED A TOW TRUCK AND THEY TOOK IT TO THE DEALER. AFTER A WHOLE DAY, THE DEALER INFORMED US THAT THEY RESET THE COMPUTER AND THAT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY $1300 FOR A NEW RACK AND PINON BECAUSE THE POWER STEERING MODULE WAS DEFECTIVE BUT IT WAS LOCATED ON THIS \"BRACKET\" AND THEY DON'T COVER THAT. THEN WHEN MY HUSBAND WENT DOWN THERE, THEY INFORMED HIM THAT FORD WON'T FIX THE PART BECAUSE SHE WAS OVER THE MILEAGE AND TIME FRAME. SHE HAD BEEN TELLING US THAT THE CAR WAS PULLING TO THE LEFT REALLY BAD, WHICH IS ALSO A REASON FOR THIS ISSUE. WE BOUGHT THIS CAR USED FROM A USED CAR DEALER. HOW WERE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW THERE WAS EVEN A RECALL ON IT LET ALONE A TIME LIMIT? I HAVE DONE RESEARCH TO FIND THAT MANY ACCIDENTS HAVE OCCURRED BECAUSE OF THIS FAULTY PART AND FORD REFUSES TO FIX THEM? HOW IS THIS SAFE? I DO NOT WANT MY 18 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER GETTING IN A WRECK DUE TO FAULTY STEERING AND KILLING HERSELF OR SOMEONE ELSE. SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE!!! THIS IS NOT THE FIRST OF THIS ISSUE BEING REPORTED EITHER. I CAN'T BELIEVE FORD HAS NOT BEEN FORCED TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM AND THAT EVERYDAY ACCIDENTS COULD HAPPEN BECAUSE OF IT. THIS COULD KILL SOMEONE! I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS AND THERE IS STILL NO SOLUTION.",
