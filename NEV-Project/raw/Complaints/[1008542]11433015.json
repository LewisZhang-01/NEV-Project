        "summary": "The contact owns a 2012 Hyundai Santa Fe. The contact stated that upon driving at 55 MPH, the contact stated that the vehicle shut off as the check engine and oil lights illuminated on the instrument panel. Due to the failure, the contact had the vehicle towed to her home. The contact was able to restart the vehicle the next day as the check engine and oil lights disappeared off the instrument panel. The contact had an independent mechanic inspect the vehicle; however, since the check engine light did not appear, the vehicle could not be diagnosed. The contact then received a recall notice for NHTSA Campaign Number: 20V746000 (Engine) and took the vehicle to a dealer where they informed her that her vehicle was fine and safe to be driven. A few months later, the contact received a second notice for the same recall and returned the vehicle back to the dealer. After a second inspection, the dealer informed her that the engine needed to be replaced. The vehicle remained in the possession of the dealer for four months and upon return of the vehicle, the check engine warning light appeared twice on the instrument panel. The contact had informed the dealer of the failure and was informed not to worry about the check engine light unless the light started flashing. She was also informed that her vehicle could not be inspected for another two weeks. The manufacturer had yet to be notified of the failure. The vehicle had yet to be repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 130,000.",
