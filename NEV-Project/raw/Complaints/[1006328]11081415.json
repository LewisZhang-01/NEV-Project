        "summary": "WHILE AT A CHEVY DEALER TO HAVE A RECALL (17276 LOSS OF POWER STEERING) DONE ON MY TRUCK I ASKED THEM TO CHECK ON A GRINDING/WHINING NOISE FROM THE AREA OF THE BRAKE BOOSTER PUMP ON THE ENGINE. THEY SAID IN FACT IT WAS THE BRAKE VACUUM BOOSTER PUMP, THAT IT SHOULD BE FIXED OR I COULD EXPERIENCE A SUDDEN LOSS OF BRAKING POWER. THEY FURTHER EXPLAINED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED UNDER WARRANTY BUT THAT EXPIRED A YEAR AGO AND WOULD NOW COST ME SOME $440.   AM WONDERING IF OTHER FOLKS HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THIS. I'VE READ OF IT HAPPENING TO OTHERS ON CERTAIN INTERNET BLOG SITES. TO MY WAY OF THINKING THE BRAKES (AND I SUPPOSE LOSS OF ABS/TRACTION CONTROL) ARE AT LEAST AS IMPORTANT AS THE STEERING THAT WAS ENOUGH OF A PROBLEM TO ISSUE A RECALL. BTW THE TRUCK HAD 27,971 MILES ON IT WHEN THE PROBLEM STARTED, HARDLY 'WARN OUT'.",
