LUCKILY, I WAS ABLE TO COAST OVER TO THE SHOULDER AND WATCHED AS THE CONSOLE LIGHTS BLINKED--VSA, BRAKE, INFORMATION LIGHT NAVIGATION SYSTEM SCREEN TURNED ON AND OFF REPEATEDLY, AND SPEEDOMETER AND RMP GAUGES WENT CRAZY.  I SAT ON THE SHOULDER AND THE CONSOLE LIGHTS AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM LIGHTS CONTINUED TO BLINK ON AND OFF, AND THEN I SAW THAT THE SYSTEM RESET AS IF THE BATTERY HAD BEEN DISCONNECTED.  THE SCREEN TO ENTER THE CODE TO RESET YOUR RADIO SYSTEM APPEARED.  THEN IT ALL STOPPED AND WENT BLANK.  I PUT THE CAR IN DRIVE TO EXIT THE INTERSTATE AND IT CONTINUED ON UNTIL I REACHED MY EXIT. HOWEVER, DURING THE DRIVE MY CONSOLE LIGHTS CONTINUED TO BLINK ON AND OFF AND THE CAR DROVE SLOWLY AND THERE WAS A DRAGGING SOUND AS IF THE ENGINE WAS OVERWORKING.   I HAD TO MANUALLY UNLOCK THE DOOR, AND MY WINDOWS WOULD NOT GO UP TO CLOSE.",
