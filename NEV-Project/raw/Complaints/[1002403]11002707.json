I JUST GOT TO 67,000 MILES, EMISSIONS CONTROL LIGHT AGAIN CAME ON, CAR HAD LOSS OF POWER AND SHAKING. AGAIN GOT TO MECHANIC IMMEDIATELY, AGAIN #1 COIL AND #2 COILS HAD TO BE REPLACED. SEEMS TO BE AN UNDERLYING ELECTRICAL PROBLEM THAT THE MANUFACTURER HAS NOT ADDRESSED. CAN THIS PROBLEM BE PERMANENTLY FIXED? WILL A KIA DEALERSHIP BE ABLE TO FIX IT EVEN THOUGH THERE SEEMS TO BE NO RECALL.",
