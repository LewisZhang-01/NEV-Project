OBVIOUSLY THE RECALL WORK WOULD BE FREE.  I WAS HAPPY TO GET THE LETTER BECAUSE MY LIFT GATE WAS BROKEN.  HOWEVER THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THE DEALER SAID IT WOULD COST $275 FOR  PARTS AND $109 IN LABOR.  THAT IS WAS JUST A COINCIDENCE THAT MY BROKEN LIFT GATE WAS BUT NOT COVERED AT ALL BY THE FREE RECALL.  THIS FELT LIKE I WAS BEING CHEATED.  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR HELP FROM THE NTSA.",
