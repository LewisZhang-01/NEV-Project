I HAVE NEARLY BEEN HIT MORE THAN 5 TIMES NOW ON SEVERAL....SEVERAL OCCASIONS DUE TO NO IMMEDIATE ACCELERATION AT A LIGHT CROSSING AN INTERSECTION, OR GOING ON THE HIGHWAY, SWITCHING LANES AND TRYING TO ACCELERATE AGAIN. THE DELAY IN THROTTLE RESPONSE IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN IN A VEHICLE. MY WIFE REFUSE TO DRIVE MY \"NEW\" TRUCK WITH OUR KIDS FOR THIS REASON. I HAD MY LOCAL DEALER CHECK IT OUT AND THEY SAID ITS NORMAL TO HAVE SUCH A BAD DELAY, EVEN SAID \"DODGE DROPPED THE BALL ON THIS ONE\". I HAVE HAD FRIENDS AND FAMILY COMMENT ON HOW BAD THE DELAY/LAG IS! I AM VERY DISHEARTENED BY THIS TO THE POINT THAT I AM NOW PRICING OUT A 2017 F-350. WE ARE PURCHASING A NEW TOY HAULER AND IN NO WAY WOULD I HOOK IT TO MY 2016 RAM DIESEL DUE TO THE THROTTLE DELAY/LAG. THIS IS MY 4TH DODGE TRUCK AND TO SWITCH BRANDS HAS BEEN A MAJOR ISSUE FOR ME. I TEST DROVE A NEW FORD F-250 (TO BE FAIR) AND A F-350 DUALLY AND THE TAKE-OFF WAS INSANELY DIFFERENT. SHAME ON YOU DODGE FOR FORCING ME INTO THIS DECISION, BUT MY FAMILY'S SAFETY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN BRAND LOYALTY. I HOPE THIS RESONATES WITH SOMEONE IN A HIGH ENOUGH POSITION TO ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS, AND NOT LET ME COMPLAINT JUST FALL THE WAYSIDE.",
