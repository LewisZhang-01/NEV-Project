SHE NOTICED THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON AND THE CAR SUDDENLY STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF A CITY ROAD- PRESENTING A DANGER TO HER AS SHE COULD NOT MOVE THE CAR AND WAS NOT IN A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD.  SHE HAD TO WAIT FOR A TOW TRUCK.  AT THE REPAIR SHOP, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE TIMING CHAIN AND TENSIONER WERE BAD SO THEY WERE REPLACED.  AFTER THIS REPAIR THE CAR STILL WOULD NOT RUN SO IT WAS TOWED TO A VOLKSWAGEN DEALERSHIP.  THEY TORE DOWN THE ENGINE AND DETERMINED THAT IT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  THE COST AT THE FIRST REPAIR SHOP WAS NEARLY $1600 AND THE COST TO REPLACE THE ENGINE IS NEARLY $9000.",
